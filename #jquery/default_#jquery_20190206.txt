[02:09:32] <CuirPork> so in order to get a font to size nicely, you can use ems for the font-size on child elements. and vmin or vmax for the font-size on the parent element...but
[02:09:56] <robertmaxrees> ...but...
[02:10:16] <CuirPork> what if you need to adjust the parent element font-size just a smidge? is there any way to adjust relative to those units
[02:10:31] <CuirPork> vh, vmin, vmax, vw
[02:10:36] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[02:11:10] <CuirPork> currently if I set my font-size to 2vh on the parent element, it works great for the children fon-sizes in em
[02:11:33] <robertmaxrees> okay let me rephrase
[02:12:02] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to modify elements based on their children?
[02:12:36] <CuirPork> Kind of. I need to fit a child element exactly into a space.. it's set using ems
[02:12:55] <robertmaxrees> heh
[02:13:02] <CuirPork> I would like to adjust the parent element's font-size so that all the children scale to whatever it takes to fit the title
[02:13:03] <robertmaxrees> yes or no - pick pls ;)
[02:13:09] <robertmaxrees> yikes
[02:13:11] <CuirPork> I'll make a fiddle
[02:13:14] <robertmaxrees> sounds like crummy data.
[02:13:27] <robertmaxrees> css doesn't really have that kind of concept.
[02:15:00] <robertmaxrees> :(
[02:19:43] <CuirPork> https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/XRKRbo?editors=0100
[02:20:11] <CuirPork> Notice if you resize the screen the ABOUT header resizes great-no problems. But the Services header is too big. And when Testimonials is added, also too big
[02:20:39] <CuirPork> and since I won't be in charge of which words are headers, I need to resize the header dynamically based on the largest word length
[02:21:00] <CuirPork> which is no problem until I try to increment vw or vh
[02:25:04] <CuirPork> so before I learned about the vmin thing, I would make the text opacity:0 on the longest element, resize it to fit the new column width, show it and resize all the remaining headers. It went really smoothly, but I'd rather let the browser do all that if possible
[02:41:17] <CuirPork> Got it! I just stored the number in a data object and incremented it before applying the units. Seems to work pretty well.
[13:33:26] <bestdesign> how to do set value if hashlass inline ?
[13:33:33] <bestdesign> hasclass
[13:33:38] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:33:51] <bestdesign> hi
[13:34:03] <taplar> hasClass returns a boolean, it's not a setter.
[13:34:12] <robertmaxrees> ohey it's taplar
[13:34:15] <taplar> yo
[13:34:18] <bestdesign> bad idea then
[13:35:38] <taplar> bestdesign: what are you trying to do?
[13:36:03] <bestdesign> im bad with explain ...
[13:36:11] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle :)
[13:42:42] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees you have the yesterday fiddle?
[13:42:55] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[13:43:01] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:43:04] <bestdesign> im not find....
[13:43:05] <bestdesign> :(
[13:43:11] <robertmaxrees> make a new one then :)
[13:48:00] <bestdesign> you help with that idiot nav robertmaxrees ::P
[13:48:16] <bestdesign> I accept your opinion btw...
[13:48:30] <robertmaxrees> i hardly remember what i ate for breakfast fwiw.
[13:48:46] <robertmaxrees> so i don't really recall what your issue was.
[13:51:09] <bestdesign> from minimalize and maximalize
[13:51:30] <bestdesign> is not count in got from button hidden state
[13:51:37] <robertmaxrees> k
[13:51:43] <bestdesign> all others works
[13:51:46] <bestdesign> just that not
[13:51:50] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:51:58] <bestdesign> why lol?
[13:52:19] <robertmaxrees> just strange that you're so resistant to making a fiddle.
[13:52:40] <bestdesign> i just make again...
[13:53:37] <robertmaxrees> https://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions fwiw
[13:53:41] <robertmaxrees> also http://learn.jquery.com/
[13:54:27] <robertmaxrees> you've been asking lots of basic questions - getting the basics down would be very helpful./
[13:54:31] <bestdesign>  availableSpace = $vlinks.width(); how to include extra space to it? if got an extra button?
[13:54:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:55:47] <bestdesign> $vlinks.width(); is get width of elements so how to include extra space what is not icontain this .width()? ways?
[13:56:14] <robertmaxrees> without context i'm still confused.  i'll be glad to help once you have a fiddle.
[13:58:21] <bestdesign> i was a save...
[13:58:22] <bestdesign> https://jsfiddle.net/46cf37xL/
[13:58:27] <cryptopsy> how do i specify which divss get made accordion in accordion in jquery-ui ?
[13:58:44] <bestdesign> so i want to include the button width from .hidden css
[13:58:50] <bestdesign> when is apply
[13:59:01] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy $( "#accordion" ).accordion();
[13:59:07] <robertmaxrees> just select the elements you want.
[13:59:23] <cryptopsy> hwo?
[13:59:26] <cryptopsy> how?
[13:59:32] <bestdesign> #id
[13:59:35] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy by... selectiong them
[13:59:37] <cryptopsy> i want to ignore certain divs INSIDE #accordion
[13:59:56] <robertmaxrees> ah.  hrm.
[14:00:01] <robertmaxrees> not sure you can do that.
[14:00:16] <robertmaxrees> could be wrong though.
[14:00:18] <robertmaxrees> bbiab.
[14:00:24] <cryptopsy> for you see, by default, the first div in #accordion becomes a folding accordion
[14:00:37] <cryptopsy> but i have additional divs, siblings which i use for :hover tooltips
[14:02:42] <cryptopsy> i think those accordion divs should have a class so accordion only accordionizes the .accordion divs
[14:02:53] <robertmaxrees> bestdesign oh this weird nav thing?
[14:03:04] <cryptopsy> ?
[14:03:09] <bestdesign> yes sorry
[14:03:16] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy sorry i had to leave for a sec.
[14:03:17] <robertmaxrees> back now.
[14:03:28] <cryptopsy> 21:01:43     cryptopsy | i think those accordion divs should have a class so accordion only accordionizes the .accordion divs
[14:03:46] <robertmaxrees> you're welcome to build that out yourself :)
[14:03:58] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/GoranMottram/b4cyx/1/
[14:04:07] <robertmaxrees> the challenge is that your use case is rare.  i'd consider restructuring your markup to get what you want
[14:04:09] <cryptopsy> in this example, the ones having .ignore class are ignored
[14:04:20] <robertmaxrees> ah, killer.
[14:04:27] <robertmaxrees> looks like it's doable then :)
[14:04:33] <cryptopsy> can i like, just pecify them directly instead of doing not(.ignore) ?
[14:04:46] <cryptopsy> h3:.accordion , something like this
[14:05:35] <robertmaxrees> you gotta select them somehow.  can always give the ones you want a class and select that instead.
[14:06:00] <cryptopsy> i tried    header: 'h1:.accordion',
[14:06:11] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:06:16] <robertmaxrees> that;s not a valid selector.
[14:06:45] <cryptopsy> how do i get rid of not() in my jsfiddle?
[14:06:57] <bestdesign> var availableSpace = $button.hasClass('hidden') ? $element.width() : $element.width() - $button.width();
[14:07:02] <bestdesign> i want something like this but not work...
[14:07:16] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy http://jsfiddle.net/wy8afs1d/ something like this.
[14:07:29] <robertmaxrees> bestdesign you're trying to get the width of a hidden element?
[14:08:00] <bestdesign> yes
[14:08:23] <bestdesign> if hidden add that width if not just simple width without hidden
[14:08:54] <robertmaxrees> oh i remember this nav now.  you're ranomly hiding nav items.
[14:09:07] <bestdesign> yes :)
[14:09:12] <robertmaxrees> #welp.
[14:09:33] <bestdesign> if button got css class .hidden then add that width extra
[14:09:45] <bestdesign> only that way others not
[14:10:20] <bestdesign> #welp empty room
[14:10:27] <bestdesign> im in
[14:10:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:10:33] <robertmaxrees> that was a joke.
[14:10:46] <robertmaxrees> so what's wrong with your calculation?
[14:11:17] <bestdesign> from .hidden CSS is not include when resize to add button and set elements navs correct width
[14:11:55] <bestdesign> have button is calculate right but from not have button is do bad if resize from that state
[14:12:33] <robertmaxrees> show me?  your fiddle doesn't have that calculation in it.
[14:12:37] <bestdesign> non button (css .hidden class) to button do bad calculate
[14:13:44] <bestdesign> because not include button width...
[14:13:59] <bestdesign> is width: 0; at css
[14:14:04] <robertmaxrees> fiddle it
[14:18:05] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees scroll out ctrl plus cursor
[14:18:37] <taplar> ...
[15:15:59] <cryptopsy> robertparkerx: does the h3 need the foo class?
[15:16:05] <cryptopsy> i am leaning toward yes b
[15:16:12] <cryptopsy> because that's the only thing im mmissing on my file
[15:17:14] <cryptopsy> and it only took me 1 hour to spot the difference XD
[15:48:15] <reynierpm> hi there guys, what is the right way to show/hide a table row? I am trying this https://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/gtacn6qw/4/ but it does not work, not sure what  I am missing any help?
[16:11:31] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: i'm trying to display a hover message on h3 in this according, but it seems to be confusing jqueryui http://jsfiddle.net/xqbsmg6a/
[16:11:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:12:01] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it would.
[16:12:15] <robertmaxrees> why not restructure your markup to be closer to what you want?
[16:12:18] <cryptopsy> it doesn't confuse h3 if the element is a child of h3
[16:12:27] <cryptopsy> i dont know how to restructure it like that
[16:13:00] <robertmaxrees> so backing WAAAAY up: what are you ultimately trying to achieve?
[16:13:27] <cryptopsy> have an accordion with a hover message
[16:13:29] <cryptopsy> on the h3's
[16:13:35] <robertmaxrees> "a hover message"?
[16:13:39] <robertmaxrees> you mean a tooltip
[16:13:40] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:13:42] <cryptopsy> on hover diplay a message
[16:13:43] <cryptopsy> yea sure
[16:13:57] <robertmaxrees> and that's what you're trying to use the "ignore" class for?>
[16:14:02] <cryptopsy> yes
[16:14:22] <robertmaxrees> https://jqueryui.com/tooltip/
[16:14:23] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:14:30] <cryptopsy> my original question was about ignoring divs, but then it became obivious that jquery requires the selector class on h3 too
[16:14:57] <robertmaxrees> why are you tryingf to ignore divs?
[16:14:57] <cryptopsy> do you think this tooltip will work on accordion?
[16:15:36] <robertmaxrees> i mean, the built-in browser tooltips could work, too.
[16:15:39] <cryptopsy> each h3 has its own tooltip
[16:15:55] <cryptopsy> basically all im trying to do is add a : number in the h3
[16:16:06] <robertmaxrees> through a tooltip
[16:16:10] <cryptopsy> like <h3> stuff</h3> should beomce <h3>stuff: 24</h3>
[16:16:20] <cryptopsy> the nubmer is stored in javascript somewhere
[16:16:38] <cryptopsy> i tried using a span instead of div
[16:16:38] <robertmaxrees> what does that have to do with tooltips then?
[16:16:51] <cryptopsy> the number should sppear on hover
[16:16:59] <robertmaxrees> in the tooltip?
[16:17:07] <robertmaxrees> or in the title?
[16:17:12] <cryptopsy> erm, maybe, if that is the strategy we choose
[16:17:15] <cryptopsy> not in the title
[16:17:19] <robertmaxrees> so then in a tooltip?
[16:17:24] <cryptopsy> i dont know what you're thinking
[16:17:37] <robertmaxrees> how would you like to display this text?
[16:17:42] <cryptopsy> not in <title>
[16:17:50] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[16:17:53] <robertmaxrees> slowwww dowwwwn
[16:17:56] <cryptopsy> imagine you have two h3's. this is hypothetical
[16:17:57] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Ls634cxm/4/
[16:18:00] <cryptopsy> <h3> stuff</h3>
[16:18:03] <cryptopsy> and you want to replace it with
[16:18:11] <cryptopsy> <h3>stuff: 14<h3>
[16:18:16] <robertmaxrees> so not in a tooltip?
[16:18:20] <cryptopsy> dude i dont know
[16:18:23] <cryptopsy> what' a tooltip?
[16:18:30] <robertmaxrees> ^ check the fiddle.
[16:18:32] <cryptopsy> in the dictionary sense of the word or in the jquery sense of the word?
[16:18:42] <robertmaxrees> or the jqui docs page i linked.
[16:18:49] <robertmaxrees> in the web development sense of the word.
[16:18:50] <cryptopsy> what tooltip are you refering to?
[16:19:00] <cryptopsy> int he web dev sense of the word they call it a hover
[16:19:02] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/dinorW5.png
[16:19:07] <robertmaxrees> we call that a tooltip
[16:19:11] <robertmaxrees> is this not what you want?
[16:19:12] <cryptopsy> if you hover over a dropdown menu is that a tooltip?
[16:19:26] <robertmaxrees> it depends on *what happens* when you hover.
[16:19:35] <cryptopsy> it shows something that wasnt there before
[16:19:39] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[16:19:43] <cryptopsy> a tooltip is more than that i need
[16:19:47] <cryptopsy> a tooltip has its own border
[16:19:50] <robertmaxrees> so you want the h3 to show more content oin hover?
[16:19:52] <cryptopsy> it followss the cursor
[16:20:01] <cryptopsy> i just want to display it on the same line after the h3
[16:20:14] <cryptopsy> one could just allign the tooltip
[16:20:20] <cryptopsy> and use position:relative or whatever
[16:20:21] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:20:24] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[16:20:32] <robertmaxrees> why not just have a hidden span in the h3 and show it on :hover ?
[16:20:47] <cryptopsy> if the span is in the h3 then the span will be an h3
[16:20:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:20:57] <cryptopsy> it will get styled by h3 styling
[16:21:06] <cryptopsy> right?
[16:21:12] <robertmaxrees> why is that a problem?
[16:21:16] <robertmaxrees> does it need to look different?
[16:21:23] <cryptopsy> it may or may not be down the road
[16:21:35] <robertmaxrees> you can still style it however you want then.
[16:21:39] <cryptopsy> why restrict myself to it being a child if i can just make it a sibling?
[16:21:50] <robertmaxrees> because that doesn't work with accordions.
[16:21:50] <cryptopsy> anyways, i tried what you suggested
[16:22:23] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Ls634cxm/7/
[16:22:28] <robertmaxrees> you can just do this?
[16:22:42] <cryptopsy> lets say i want the span to be on top of the h3
[16:22:56] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: yes that's acceptable for now
[16:23:01] <robertmaxrees> lol alright.
[16:23:05] <cryptopsy> its ugly but its neat
[16:23:09] <robertmaxrees> how is it ugly?
[16:23:20] <cryptopsy> it would be nicer if the number appear on top of the h3
[16:23:24] <cryptopsy> so as to now overflow
[16:23:30] <cryptopsy> if the titles are long for example
[16:23:33] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean "on top of the h3"?
[16:23:45] <robertmaxrees> you mean replace the text entirely with the count?
[16:23:46] <cryptopsy> like a tooltip, but unlike a tooltip it would not follow the cursor arround
[16:23:52] <cryptopsy> not replace it
[16:23:57] <cryptopsy> just like a popup window
[16:24:09] <robertmaxrees> so you DO want a tooltip, you just want the tooltip to be constrained?
[16:24:25] <cryptopsy> ehm, in this context yes
[16:24:32] <cryptopsy> lets not use jqueryui tooltip?
[16:24:37] <robertmaxrees> i give up
[16:24:42] <robertmaxrees> i can't figure out what you want lol
[16:24:52] <cryptopsy> put the 5000 on top of Actual Two
[16:25:24] <cryptopsy> right now it is to the right of it
[16:26:13] <cryptopsy> its important not to call this a tooltip since a tooltip AFAIK implies it follow the cursor arround
[16:26:15] <robertmaxrees> then change its position using CSS>
[16:26:20] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't.
[16:26:23] <cryptopsy> to say, a tooltip with a fixed position is like saying a menu is a tooltip
[16:26:31] <robertmaxrees> tooltip just means "stuff that shows in a box when you hover"
[16:26:38] <cryptopsy> lol
[16:26:40] <robertmaxrees> menus are menus.
[16:26:46] <cryptopsy> yea
[16:26:48] <cryptopsy> menus ar emenus
[16:26:53] <robertmaxrees> tooltips provide context based on where you hover.
[16:27:20] <cryptopsy> so how would you put 5000 on top of Actual Two?
[16:27:26] <robertmaxrees> if you want to change where that number shows, either use a tooltip and constrain it, or move it using css.
[16:27:34] <cryptopsy> can you shift it with css?
[16:27:40] <robertmaxrees> yes
[16:27:41] <cryptopsy> ah yep
[16:28:02] <cryptopsy> my instinct tells me not to fck with jqueryui tooltip for the next 3 hours only to find out accordion gets confused again
[16:28:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:28:23] <robertmaxrees> it's not hard duder
[16:28:27] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Ls634cxm/12/
[16:28:30] <robertmaxrees> there ya go (shrug)
[16:29:32] <robertmaxrees> you're welcome
[16:29:56] <cryptopsy> the idea is, it didnt seem hard from the start either trying to use a selector
[16:30:21] <robertmaxrees> the issue is that jqui accordions assume a particular markup layout.
[16:30:23] <cryptopsy> css is simpler, i dont know what accordion and tooltip are doing behind it all
[16:30:38] <cryptopsy> maybe i'll transplant this accordion into some other structure and it will break agian
[16:30:49] <robertmaxrees> i mean
[16:30:56] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/ the docs are pretty straightforward on this subject.
[16:31:28] <cryptopsy> jqui doc showed the structure of accordion has h+div pairs, but actually it expectes the div to be right after the h, actually it expects a lot of things like not even a non-selected div to be bebtween this pair
[16:31:36] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:31:54] <robertmaxrees> because the structure is <h3>heading</h3><div>content</div>
[16:32:02] <cryptopsy> would would think that it would stick the dictionary definition of 'ignore'
[16:32:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:32:20] <cryptopsy> we seelected only the foo class for accordion
[16:32:27] <cryptopsy> and putting an ignore class between the pair broke it
[16:32:31] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[16:32:37] <cryptopsy> obvioulsy it didn't ignore it then
[16:32:42] <robertmaxrees> because you broke the sibling relationship it expects.
[16:32:58] <cryptopsy> we selected for .foo, so its sibling is a foo
[16:32:59] <robertmaxrees> jquery ui accordions don't have the concept of restructuring markup
[16:33:05] <robertmaxrees> no
[16:33:13] <robertmaxrees> you said .foo would be the heading element.
[16:33:36] <cryptopsy> so i got tricked into trying all the variations of moving things around for an hour or two for this to become apparent
[16:33:45] <cryptopsy> beause the doc didnt specify it
[16:33:56] <robertmaxrees> didn't specify *what*?
[16:34:21] <cryptopsy> that selector is not respecting div class in the decision making
[16:34:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:34:33] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/gD0qFc8.png
[16:34:39] <cryptopsy> h3.class div.class, there's the siblings
[16:34:40] <robertmaxrees> did you read any of the docs?
[16:34:51] <robertmaxrees> they very clear about this lol
[16:34:57] <cryptopsy> there's your pair
[16:35:09] <cryptopsy> let me asking you something, is apple and orange a pair? no they're different things
[16:35:21] <cryptopsy> you can call a small apple and a big apple a pair
[16:35:21] <robertmaxrees> "[...] each content panel must always be the next sibling after its associated header."
[16:35:38] <robertmaxrees> it is unambiguous as to the requirements (shrug)
[16:35:54] <cryptopsy> 'the markup of your accordion container needs pair of headers and content panels'
[16:35:54] <robertmaxrees> if you disagree, feel free to submit a pr for the documentation to the maintainers.
[16:36:12] <robertmaxrees> read the paragraph below the markup example.
[16:36:25] <cryptopsy> your screenshot doesnt say anything about class, one would assume pairs are things with the same class, logically
[16:36:32] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[16:36:39] <cryptopsy> it literally says that in the 2nd par
[16:36:45] <cryptopsy> 'after its associated header'
[16:36:55] <cryptopsy> keyword associated
[16:36:56] <robertmaxrees> "next sibling"
[16:37:04] <cryptopsy> things with different clsases are associated? huh didnt know that
[16:37:06] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to argue this any more lol
[16:37:12] <robertmaxrees> enjoy :)
[16:37:14] <cryptopsy> didnt know apples and oranges are associated
[16:37:24] <robertmaxrees> feel free to drop the subject now :)
[16:37:25] <robertmaxrees> moving on./
[16:37:33] <cryptopsy> cmon now you know i'm right
[16:37:37] <robertmaxrees> i think you're wrong.
[16:37:44] <cryptopsy> i understand your reasoning
[16:37:53] <robertmaxrees> this is literally the first time I'm hearing anybody be unclear about this.
[16:38:15] <robertmaxrees> it's fine if you disagree - feel free to open a pr against the docs to clarify.
[16:38:20] <cryptopsy> you're pidgeonholing me with previous discussions you've had on similar but different things?
[16:38:21] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, let's move on :)
[16:39:16] <cryptopsy> i feel violated
[16:40:14] <cryptopsy> perhaps it should add after 'associated header', ", regardless of its class"
[16:40:35] <robertmaxrees> one last time: please drop the subject.
[16:40:37] <robertmaxrees> Thanks!
[16:45:18] <cryptopsy> are you using jqueryui tooltip when i hover over the questionmark next to the number of doors on the showers page on build.com ?
[16:45:27] <robertmaxrees> nope
[16:45:35] <robertmaxrees> not that i recall, at least.
[16:45:47] <cryptopsy> it looks like its something the browser gives
[16:45:54] <robertmaxrees> link?
[16:46:03] <cryptopsy> https://www.build.com/shower-sale/c127225
[16:46:14] <cryptopsy> cant screenshot because i need the curor on the ?
[16:46:29] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/hOkJ9LI.png these?
[16:46:45] <cryptopsy> yea but you clicked it, i hovered it
[16:46:58] <cryptopsy> i get what you have in that image when i click it
[16:47:00] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/JihxyrW.png you mean this?
[16:47:10] <cryptopsy> yes
[16:47:15] <robertmaxrees> that's the default title text from the broweser.
[16:47:17] <robertmaxrees> *browser
[16:47:28] <cryptopsy> what title?
[16:47:36] <robertmaxrees> the title attribute on the element.
[16:47:42] <cryptopsy> ohhh
[16:48:00] <robertmaxrees> it's for improved accessibility.
[16:48:07] <cryptopsy> damn, 475$ for a shower pipe?
[16:48:09] <robertmaxrees> you use it to describe the link.
[16:48:18] <cryptopsy> i was thinking of <title>
[16:48:26] <robertmaxrees> "shower pipe"?
[16:48:36] <robertmaxrees> you mean the hansgrohe?
[16:48:41] <cryptopsy> yes
[16:48:48] <robertmaxrees> that's more than "a shower pipe"
[16:49:14] <robertmaxrees> but yes.  some manufacturers are expensive.
[16:49:14] <cryptopsy> but originally it was 914$
[16:49:25] <robertmaxrees> that's likely MSRP
[16:49:30] <robertmaxrees> the 914
[16:49:36] <robertmaxrees> anyway.  back on topic :)
[16:50:08] <cryptopsy> hansgrobe commented in the comments, do they get notifications when a user posts a question?
[16:50:35] <cryptopsy> on the Product Q+A page
[16:50:44] <robertmaxrees> pretty sure?
[16:50:50] <robertmaxrees> not my part of the site.
[16:50:57] <cryptopsy> you just style it?
[16:51:03] <robertmaxrees> i don't work on the product pages.
[16:51:07] <robertmaxrees> can we get back on topic?
[16:51:41] <cryptopsy> when you hover on Appliances, a white rectangle pops up, is that a tooltip?
[16:51:52] <robertmaxrees> where?
[16:51:57] <cryptopsy> on the main page
[16:52:07] <cryptopsy> the blakc horizontal menu
[16:52:19] <robertmaxrees> *Sigh*
[16:52:21] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/oCLna5L.png you mean this?
[16:52:29] <cryptopsy> yes
[16:52:33] <robertmaxrees> that would be a menu.
[16:53:02] <robertmaxrees> and now back to the channel topic :)
[16:53:17] <cryptopsy> why are you hurting me like this? you said a tooltip is when you hover over it and stuff appears
[16:54:43] <cryptopsy> was there a channel for jqui a while ago?
[16:54:58] <robertmaxrees> hasn't been for years.
[16:56:56] <cryptopsy> how come jqui provides no image slideshow?
[16:57:36] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[16:57:55] <cryptopsy> can accordion be horizontal instead ov vertical?
[16:58:06] <robertmaxrees> check the docs
[17:00:20] <cryptopsy> i mean, should i be checking if it is not possible?
[17:00:30] <cryptopsy> i am on and off the jqui doc page pretty often
[17:00:51] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:01:04] <cryptopsy> i suppose the answer is no
[17:01:09] <robertmaxrees> if the docs don't mention anything about "horizontal" or "orientation" or w/e, what does that suggest?
[17:01:21] <cryptopsy> it suggest no
[17:01:24] <robertmaxrees> great.
[17:01:31] <cryptopsy> ??
[17:01:41] <robertmaxrees> you would likely be correct.
[17:02:51] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/5UpQc/1/
[17:03:01] <robertmaxrees> cool
[18:34:08] <cryptopsy> robertparkerx: how come .img isnt show/hiding? http://jsfiddle.net/phrj174k/
[18:37:06] <cryptopsy> err
[18:39:24] <taplar> cryptopsy: there's a display none on it
[18:45:22] <cryptopsy> taplar: thats normal, it is hidden until hovered on it
[18:46:08] <cryptopsy> you hover on the <li> and it becomes display:inline;
[18:47:32] <taplar> your css rule is incorrect.  + donotes a sibling
[18:47:39] <taplar> *denotes
[18:48:48] <robertmaxrees> also: cryptopsy please don't ping people like that with questions.  just ask the channel.
[19:20:26] <gambl0r3> hello?
[19:22:46] <gambl0r3> how does jquery's prototype chaining work?
[19:23:08] <robertmaxrees> the same as any other prototype chaining/
[19:23:19] <robertmaxrees> jquery functions return jquery objects.
[19:23:31] <gambl0r3> hey robert, hows going?
[19:23:38] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[19:23:45] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[19:23:50] <robertmaxrees> that answer your question?
[19:24:13] <gambl0r3> not really
[19:24:21] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what's not clear?
[19:24:25] <gambl0r3> i dont understand how it works
[19:24:44] <robertmaxrees> do you understand how javascript prototypes work?
[19:25:06] <gambl0r3> no
[19:25:19] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes
[19:25:30] <robertmaxrees> give this a read.  should help you get started.\
[19:25:41] <gambl0r3> whats the relation between a javascript object and a javascript class?
[19:25:56] <robertmaxrees> js classes are syntactic sugar over prototypes.
[19:26:17] <robertmaxrees> so understanding prototypes will unlock a lot of mystery for you.
[19:26:40] <gambl0r3> ok so whats the relation between a javascript object and a javascript class?
[19:26:58] <robertmaxrees> Read the page on prototypes and then read up on objects and then classes.
[19:27:00] <robertmaxrees> ezpz.
[19:27:00] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:27:22] <gambl0r3> i already have and i still dont understand which is why im asking here
[19:28:18] <robertmaxrees> a js class is syntactic sugar over a constructor function.
[19:28:37] <robertmaxrees> which spits out objects with a particular prototype.
[21:34:36] <znf> How do I select a previous "input" element that I assigned $.data() to it ?
[21:34:42] <znf> based on the specific data
[21:34:49] <robertmaxrees> so which is it?
[21:34:54] <robertmaxrees> select on data or select previous?
[21:36:11] <znf> I'm walking trough a form's inputs, and I'm assigning $.data('formType', 'something')
[21:36:32] <znf> then later on I need to select all elements I assigned "formType"
[21:36:46] <robertmaxrees> i'd use .filter() with a function.
[21:36:47] <znf> I tried $('input[data-formType="something"')
[21:37:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah that won't work because you're assigning using .data() :)
[21:37:07] <robertmaxrees> which is good.
[21:37:17] <znf> but I don't want to use a filter/function :-|
[21:37:23] <robertmaxrees> why?
[21:37:24] <robertmaxrees> ??
[21:37:28] <znf> sounds complicated
[21:37:39] <robertmaxrees> just do $('input').filter(function() { return $(this).data('formType'); });
[21:37:41] <robertmaxrees> done.
[21:37:42] <robertmaxrees> !next
[21:38:01] <znf> that's a hell lot of code to add tough
[21:38:18] <znf> as I need to do it for about 10 fields :-/
[21:41:28] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[21:41:32] <robertmaxrees> 2 things: 1 abstract it out.
[21:41:43] <robertmaxrees> 2: you can't use a selector anyway, so...
[21:43:43] <znf> I'm also not sure from your example how I would filter only the element(s) that have a specific value for 'formType'
[21:44:01] <robertmaxrees> so .data('formType') fetches the value.
[21:44:07] <robertmaxrees> of formType
[21:44:11] <robertmaxrees> so you would...
[21:44:43] <robertmaxrees> $('input').filter(function() { return $(this).data('formType') === 'foo'; });
[21:45:41] <znf> so, if I make a function getMyFormType(foo) { $('input').filter(function() { return $(this).data('formType') === foo; }); }
[21:45:56] <robertmaxrees> erm./
[21:45:57] <robertmaxrees> no.
[21:45:57] <znf> I should be able to use getMyFormType(foo).val('input value')
[21:46:02] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[21:46:11] <robertmaxrees> because your 'this' won't be what you want.
[21:46:43] <robertmaxrees> you'd abstract the callback for filter()
[21:46:47] <robertmaxrees> gotta fiddle?
[21:47:08] <znf> hmm, you lost me at the callback
[21:47:43] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle and i'll show you :)
[21:49:23] <znf> sec, let me copy/paste relevant bits
[21:52:19] <znf> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/3owf04k2/
[21:52:31] <robertmaxrees> yikes.
[21:53:09] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[21:53:13] <robertmaxrees> so what's the end goal here?
[21:54:45] <znf> I've got a billing system/cms, and I'm trying to do some form autocomplete (then later some validation) with the users details, I'm trying to avoid editing the vendor's templates files, because I don't want to create the need for extra work whenever we update it (which is once every 2-3 months); so instead of relying on editing the .tpl files (Smarty) to pre-fill the data, I'd rather do it via javascript
[21:55:13] <robertmaxrees> :|
[21:55:21] <robertmaxrees> okay....
[21:55:26] <robertmaxrees> you'... a little
[21:55:33] <robertmaxrees> *you're making this a little hard on yourself.
[21:55:45] <znf> I can't really change the name/id of the form input elements
[21:55:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah but like.
[21:56:02] <robertmaxrees> you're whole array setup is strange.
[21:56:18] <robertmaxrees> so you're getting these values via an ajax call?
[21:56:35] <robertmaxrees> err, wait.
[21:57:01] <znf> yeah, I'm trying to get the data from /custom/clientdata.php which provides the currently logged on user's information
[21:57:11] <znf> to which array are you referring to?
[21:57:12] <robertmaxrees> so uh.
[21:57:29] <robertmaxrees> why not return the JSON in a format that gives you input name along with the value?
[21:57:35] <robertmaxrees> let roForms = [];
[21:57:56] <robertmaxrees> also: what's with the data attributes?  what are those doing?
[21:58:56] <znf> This specific section I'm working on right now handles domain configuration; we use all the extra fields for .ro domains, but in the cart there could be multiple domain types (.com, .eu, .whatever), and those don't require the extra details; sometimes there's 2 .ro domains
[21:59:13] <robertmaxrees> let me cut to the chase - you're doing a whole lot of work that seems... unnecessary.
[21:59:30] <znf> I figured that because the only type of domain we are requesting this data has option[value="p"], I can find the array of the element(s) and the go further from that
[21:59:43] <znf> I'm assigning the formType stuff to later validate user input
[21:59:47] <robertmaxrees> this is all really fragile.
[21:59:57] <znf> the same page/cart section handles logged in users and anonymous users
[22:00:15] <robertmaxrees> one change to, for instance, the index of an input and the whole thing falls apart.
[22:01:03] <znf> how so? I'm not really sure on the terms here
[22:01:30] <robertmaxrees> so like name="domainfield[0][0]"
[22:01:44] <robertmaxrees> you have a ton of input names that are formatted like this.
[22:01:52] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing these are autogenerated somehow?
[22:01:56] <znf> yup
[22:02:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's not good for what you want to do.
[22:02:17] <robertmaxrees> i would reconsider doing this server-side.
[22:02:27] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you'll want to rethink your form's markup.
[22:02:30] <znf> and I can't really change them without heavily modifying the billing system..
[22:02:39] <znf> ...which is ioncube'd so...
[22:02:51] <robertmaxrees> i would, at least, move this logic server-side to handle the mapping.
[22:03:09] <znf> that's a step I'm particularly trying to avoid
[22:03:20] <robertmaxrees> heh
[22:03:20] <znf> we currently have this on our 2013 designed website, everything's changed...
[22:03:32] <robertmaxrees> i know all about dealing with legacy codebases.
[22:03:38] <znf> guy who made it years ago is no longer reachable/can't remember what he did well
[22:03:54] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to help you avoid some major pitfalls.
[22:04:15] <znf> We were "stuck" on the same version of the CMS for 6 years, because we couldn't find someone that wanted to work out with Smarty
[22:04:34] <robertmaxrees> and higher ups aren't willing to migrate?
[22:04:43] <znf> We finally caved in, and in November we upgraded from version 6.1 to 7.5... let me tell you, those weren't fun days
[22:05:00] <znf> We still have missing functionality, it's non-essential, but...
[22:05:11] <robertmaxrees> we have some legacy systems in coldfusion - i know all about stuff like that.
[22:05:19] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[22:05:38] <znf> A complete billing system refactor would cost us... way too much, maybe more than the company makes in a year :P
[22:05:44] <robertmaxrees> heh
[22:05:55] <znf> previous attempts to do that were left to rot, after months of paying developers
[22:06:01] <robertmaxrees> so let's go back to your original question.
[22:06:20] <robertmaxrees> you want to select things based on data attribute values?
[22:06:45] <znf> We're a small company, basically it's just me and the owner (and some phone-support guys), we're both mostly into system administration, but I dabble a bit in code, so we just decided to do it ourselves, at least we know how it should work
[22:06:48] <znf> yup
[22:06:58] <znf> I just need to select those inputs based on their "type"
[22:07:09] <znf> I need to do it in 2 places:
[22:07:11] <robertmaxrees> wait
[22:07:12] <robertmaxrees> stop
[22:07:22] <robertmaxrees> their type or a data value?
[22:07:44] <znf> data value, sorry
[22:07:49] <znf> or, rather, let me rephrase
[22:08:45] <znf> I need to be able to, later in code, tell that "this input takes <city/county/name>"
[22:08:45] <lonequid> y
[22:08:58] <robertmaxrees> heh
[22:09:06] <robertmaxrees> so the value of some data on the node?
[22:09:08] <robertmaxrees> :)
[22:09:13] <znf> I assumed that setting up a data-type="cnp" would be the best way to do it
[22:09:19] <znf> but apparently .data() doesn't work that way
[22:09:22] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[22:09:23] <robertmaxrees> it does.
[22:09:28] <robertmaxrees> you're WAY overcomplicating this.
[22:09:35] <robertmaxrees> trying to dial things back to show you this in isolation.
[22:09:46] <robertmaxrees> becuase you're stuck on the whole big form.  just focus on this one problem :)
[22:10:12] <znf> well, if it were simply a data-type="cnp" attribute, I could have done $('input[data-type="cnp"]') :P
[22:10:31] <robertmaxrees> heh, selecting like that is a really, really bad idea fwiw.
[22:10:53] <znf> probably, but it was the best idea I had without touching the markup server-side
[22:10:59] <robertmaxrees> which is fine.
[22:11:04] <robertmaxrees> you just need to learn some tools
[22:12:42] <robertmaxrees> so, let's say you have this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/a5ejow4y/
[22:12:58] <robertmaxrees> you're assigning the dataType, etc.
[22:13:07] <znf> ok
[22:13:20] <robertmaxrees> make sense so far?
[22:13:23] <znf> yup
[22:13:47] <robertmaxrees> okay, so now you wanna select, say, bazqux, right?
[22:13:58] <znf> yup
[22:14:52] <robertmaxrees> so you might have something like this:
[22:14:52] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/a5ejow4y/8/
[22:15:04] <robertmaxrees> but now you wanna be able to repeat that filter for each "type", right?
[22:15:32] <znf> yeah, writing half of that 10 times does not sound appealing
[22:15:57] <robertmaxrees> so there are a few ways to approach this.
[22:17:04] <robertmaxrees> you COULD do something like https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/a5ejow4y/12/
[22:17:08] <robertmaxrees> which you mentioned earlier.
[22:17:35] <robertmaxrees> but it looks like you have an array of these types, and for each one you want to get the corresponding input, right?
[22:17:58] <znf> yup
[22:19:46] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/a5ejow4y/14/
[22:19:47] <znf> rather, inputS, sometimes there will be more than 1
[22:19:48] <robertmaxrees> soemthing like this.
[22:19:57] <robertmaxrees> ^ this'll work for that case.
[22:21:24] <znf> would this work with jquery 1.12.4 btw?
[22:21:32] <znf> I just realized I'm running an older version
[22:21:48] <robertmaxrees> this'll work back to pre 1.9 :)
[22:21:54] <robertmaxrees> nothing I'm using there is special.
[22:22:58] <znf> wait, I'm confused a bit, where does currentDataType come from? in this case it's blank?
[22:23:20] <znf> ah
[22:23:21] <znf> got it
[22:24:00] <znf> tough I'm not sure how would your last example help me, the previous one seems to fit my needs
[22:25:07] <znf> what am I missing?
[22:25:48] <robertmaxrees> the .map() for starters./
[22:25:51] <robertmaxrees> :)
[22:26:11] <robertmaxrees> instead of creating an array and then doing a .push() into it.
[22:32:27] <znf> Treat me like an idiot and ELI5 why is that better? :)
[22:33:00] <robertmaxrees> okay so.
[22:33:09] <robertmaxrees> what you ultimately wanted was to get an array, right?
[22:34:51] <robertmaxrees> so there's this idea that you should get away from implementation details - instead of prescribing what the code should do, you instead describe the end result.
[22:35:02] <robertmaxrees> descriptive vs prescriptive coding.
[22:35:47] <znf> Not really, I just need the elements so I can complete them with the clients data
[22:35:53] <znf> I could probably use an array, yes
[22:35:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:35:58] <znf> btu I haven't wrapped my head around it
[22:35:59] <robertmaxrees> you already HAVE an array.
[22:36:01] <znf> but*
[22:36:13] <robertmaxrees> i'm just showing you a smarter way to build it :)
[22:36:55] <znf> Must be the alcohol and 5:36am attempts to code
[22:37:01] <robertmaxrees> yikes
[22:37:02] <znf> I really appreciate it :)
[22:37:25] <robertmaxrees> heh.  i'd start making the case that y'all need to make some serious fixes soon.
[22:37:48] <robertmaxrees> refactors/rebuilds can be expensive, but stuff like this is risky, fragile, and takes longer.
[22:37:54] <robertmaxrees> making it more expensive.
[22:39:05] <znf> To be fair, someone who actually codes for a living could do it faster
[22:39:15] <robertmaxrees> erm wait
[22:39:39] <znf> But our coder "friends" are all either retired or just moved on to do other more productive things
[22:39:42] <robertmaxrees> you don't have any software engineers on staff?
[22:39:47] <robertmaxrees> :|
[22:39:56] <robertmaxrees> i'd make that priority #1 tbh.
[22:39:57] <znf> When we "shopped around" for coders, when they heard "Smarty" they hard noped
[22:40:21] <znf> We're a webhosting company, so no, as "bad" as it sounds, we don't exactly need a full-time coder
[22:40:29] <robertmaxrees> you do though.
[22:40:36] <robertmaxrees> if i were you i'd be terrified about potential security holes.
[22:41:07] <robertmaxrees> also: the amount of time you're spending just trying to hack this stuff together is gonna end up costing you way more in the long run :/
[22:42:24] <znf> I would normally agree with you, and I know where you're coming from, but if we look at hard numbers, it's hard to justify - we still made money and functioned on the same website base for ~6 years. We just wanted to upgrade because we were seriously lagging behind and we wanted fancy features the new version of the platform that we were using
[22:42:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:42:48] <robertmaxrees> you're not factoring in risk when your app gets pwned
[22:42:50] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[22:42:58] <znf> Also, I'm frankly surprised there were no vulnerabilities yet in our platform
[22:43:04] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[22:43:14] <znf> (yes I know, that we know of)
[22:43:23] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[22:43:29] <robertmaxrees> you don't have the expertise
[22:43:36] <robertmaxrees> so you can't really make that assessment.
[22:44:03] <znf> to be fair, there hasn't been any CVE for it in years https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-10798/Whmcs.html
[22:44:12] <robertmaxrees> i'm not talking about your platform./
[22:44:18] <robertmaxrees> i'm talking about the code you're writing for it.
[22:44:35] <robertmaxrees> but hey, your call - not my money :)
[22:44:40] <znf> I appreciate the concern :)
[22:44:56] <znf> it's actually one more reason I am trying to not touch any of the server-side code
[22:45:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:45:11] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[22:46:14] <znf> Heck, I made the "clientdata" stuff that extracts the user data specifically to not take any user input
[22:46:15] <znf> thanks :)
[22:46:26] <znf> again, thank you very much for the help, couldn't have figured it myself
[22:48:20] <znf> robertmaxrees, quick question - const's are what you would call "global", right?
[22:48:26] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[22:48:32] <robertmaxrees> nothing to do with that.
[22:48:40] <robertmaxrees> const and let are both block-scoped.
[22:48:42] <znf> they are like let, "local" to the block?
[22:48:46] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[22:48:51] <znf> uhm
[22:48:53] <robertmaxrees> they're both scoped the exact same.
[22:49:03] <znf> ok :)
[22:49:06] <robertmaxrees> consts can't change reference once they're assigned.
[22:49:10] <robertmaxrees> lets can.
[22:49:26] <robertmaxrees> which means, in general, you want to use const when possible.
[22:58:19] <znf> hmm, why would $.getJSON({ url: "/custom/clientdata.php", function( data ) { console.log(data); } }); not work?
[22:58:34] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't have a job ;)
[22:58:39] <robertmaxrees> (define "not work")
[22:59:06] <znf> console.log does not get executed
[22:59:14] <znf> oh, .ajax takes url:
[22:59:15] <robertmaxrees> the getJSON call is failing.
[22:59:16] <znf> getJSON doesn't
[22:59:27] <robertmaxrees> (use $.ajax() btw )
[23:00:07] <znf> I was going for .ajax, but I tought using the shorthand is... handier
[23:00:22] <robertmaxrees> heh
[23:00:31] <robertmaxrees> it just uses ajax under the hood (shrug)
[23:02:23] <znf> nice, it worked
