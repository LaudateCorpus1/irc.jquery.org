[00:06:27] <Zeranoe> How could I detect if the browser is mobile or desktop?
[00:10:46] <\mSg> just build responsive, and use feature detection before doing certain things and you should be good to go. Why do you need to know if it's mobile or desktop or tablet, or tablet that can be turned into a full desktop experience, or various shades of grey between?
[00:14:06] <Zeranoe> I'm trying to disable Bootstrap tooltips for mobile since they don't function correctly
[00:15:34] <Zeranoe> Unrelated, but what is the purpose of $(function () { $(something).event() }); vs just $(something).event()? Why is the function () included?
[00:16:55] <\mSg> so you're more concerned about the width of the screen, you can detect that. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11903001/hiding-bootstrap-tooltips-on-mobile-using-media-queries
[00:20:04] <\mSg> Zeranoe, that looks like a shortcut for jquery's document.ready
[00:20:27] <Zeranoe> I thought the $() was already document.ready?
[00:29:24] <\mSg> if you just slap $('.foo').click(function() { alert('test'); }) into a <script> tag in your head, it won't work. https://jsfiddle.net/u8x17wnq/1/
[00:29:45] <\mSg> but add the ready, https://jsfiddle.net/u8x17wnq/2/
[00:30:28] <\mSg> or the full syntax: https://jsfiddle.net/u8x17wnq/3/
[00:48:24] <stupiduser123> hi
[00:48:41] <stupiduser123> i don't understand why event.preventDefault() isn't working in my code
[00:48:51] <stupiduser123> https://jsfiddle.net/hgd93ofu/1/
[00:50:08] <systemfault> stupiduser123: The submit event works on a <form> element
[00:50:17] <systemfault> Not on a input
[00:52:20] <stupiduser123> systemfault: because before my code looked like this: https://jsfiddle.net/6a4e57gz/
[00:52:39] <stupiduser123> someone told me that the form element automatically checks for the enter key so i should just have a button instead
[00:57:11] <systemfault> stupiduser123: Attach the submit event to the form, not the button
[00:57:36] <stupiduser123> okay i just figured that out thanks for confirming :)

[10:18:38] <Danielss89> Hi, i seem to have a problem submitting a form with jquery. I'm trying the following: $(this).closest('form').submit();
[10:18:57] <Danielss89> but the form is not submittet. If i log $(this).closest('form'), it shows the correct form
[10:29:01] <TimCoal> hi Danielss89, can yo do an example in http://jsfiddle.net
[10:49:51] <MarkX> https://jsfiddle.net/8sxhrqpv/
[10:49:56] <MarkX> i can't figure out why that doesn't work
[10:50:02] <MarkX> i'm specifying the height and width in my CSS but i keep getting an error in console: query-3.1.0.js:3793 Uncaught Error: Invalid dimensions for plot, width = 382.046875, height = 0
[10:50:13] <MarkX> if I specify by ID it works but it does not seem to like me using a class :S
[10:50:21] <MarkX> any help would be greatly appreciated
[10:55:14] <shoky> MarkX: where are you setting the height & width..?
[10:55:36] <MarkX> shoky, in the css
[10:55:38] <MarkX> the .box
[10:55:59] <shoky> MarkX: .box is not the elements you're running the plot in
[10:56:09] <shoky> your plot elements have height 0 still
[10:56:27] <MarkX> hmm i'm totally confused then
[10:56:48] <shoky> your plot elements do not have the box class
[10:57:09] <MarkX> do they not inherit the class?
[10:57:13] <shoky> no..
[10:57:17] <MarkX> ohhhh
[10:57:39] <MarkX> hmm i should read up on how to use classes properly then
[10:57:53] <shoky> only the element you put the class on has that class
[10:58:15] <MarkX> i see
[10:58:32] <MarkX> where does it get the width then?
[10:58:45] <MarkX> because it is somehow saying the width = 382.046875
[10:59:13] <shoky> because divs are block elements, they stretch to their container's width by default
[10:59:24] <shoky> but not their height
[10:59:43] <MarkX> ahhh i see
[11:00:21] <MarkX> okay let me read up on classes
[11:00:26] <MarkX> and see how i can use them better
[11:01:18] <shoky> you wouldn't want all its children to inherit the class anyway...  e.g. if there's a <button> inside you wouldn't want it to get that class, would you? ;p
[11:02:00] <MarkX> good point :)
[11:07:16] <MarkX> so if i have repeated structures, for example a header and plot div inside a div repeated over and over, is there a way to have one bigger class defined in css to handle that?
[11:09:09] <MarkX> something like .box { height: 30%; width 40%; header { color:red; }; plotDiv { height: 30%; width: 40%; } }
[11:09:59] <shoky> .box { ... }    .box header { ... }     .box .plotDiv { ... }
[11:10:05] <shoky> you should go learn some basic css :)
[11:10:15] <MarkX> yes i think so
[11:10:20] <MarkX> i just wanted something basic
[11:10:38] <MarkX> this is nothing but a test app that i wanted to whip up in a few minutes, to show some data
[11:27:46] <jp123> excuse me, do you know some sites where i can get a code for smooth zoom pan for free?
[13:16:49] <willc> Is it a known issue that using page up skews the results of $(window).scrollTop() ?
[13:17:44] <willc> I have a script that fades a background. If the user is scrolled to the top it is supposed to be 100% opacity. I'm finding if I scroll up with pageUp then the results return something in the 0.2-0.1 range.

[16:01:10] <skokkkk> hi there. http://pastebin.com/wjwtgEv7 I want the name elements of the "IP" and "ENGINE" parts to be incremented by 1 every time the button is pressed
[16:01:18] <skokkkk> could someone please help?
[16:21:00] <TimCoal> skokkkk  could you do an example in http://jsfiddle.net
[16:21:24] <skokkkk> TimCoal: that code doesnt run on jsfiddle even
[16:21:50] <TimCoal> why not?
[16:23:02] <TimCoal> if you have it on jsfiddle thats a start
[17:53:05] <metrixx> hi.
[17:53:38] <metrixx> what is difference between function() { $("#divid").dialog(.... and
[17:53:51] <metrixx> direct usage of $("$divid").dialog( ??
[17:58:59] <systemfault> One is inside a function and the other isn't?
[18:01:49] <TimCoal> i could have a stab at a definition, but i'd probably get shot down for my ignorance
[18:03:21] <TimCoal> there is no diffrance in the result the differance is how it is handled on execution
[18:03:36] <_hello_welt_> Hello!!
[18:03:57] <TimCoal> hello
[18:04:17] <TimCoal> there is no diffrance in the result the differance is how it is handled on execution
[18:04:48] <_hello_welt_> If I'm loading a script '<script src="./blah.js">...', what's the correct way to ensure the content of the script is not executed before the DOM is loaded? $(document).ready(), inside this external script??
[18:04:58] <TimCoal> it is related to context
[18:05:11] <TimCoal> _hello_welt_ containment
[18:05:33] <_hello_welt_> TimCoal: can you tell me more about this
[18:06:35] <shoky> _hello_welt_: yes that is one way, another way is to include the <script> at the end of your <body> tag
[18:07:42] <TimCoal> yes, but it still feels odd to have script tags at the bottom
[18:08:09] <shoky> not really, it's very common nowadays, i see it everywhere
[18:09:48] <TimCoal> i'm long in the tooth, been too long to change habbits without good reason
[18:10:09] <TimCoal> i prefer to wrap the script file in
[18:10:12] <TimCoal> ;($(function() {
[18:10:15] <TimCoal> }(jQuery)
[18:10:36] <shoky> that doesn't make much sense ;p
[18:10:48] <_hello_welt_> shoky, yes i have it at the end, but i thought (probably incorrectly) that still the DOM may not be completely loaded when the script is loaded
[18:10:53] <TimCoal> sorry done that from an old file
[18:10:59] <TimCoal> its late
[18:11:00] <shoky> you're calling that function as an IIFE and passing the result to $()
[18:11:08] <_hello_welt_> TimCoal, that looks stramge
[18:11:24] <TimCoal> that is :p
[18:11:27] <_hello_welt_> how does that delay execution until the DOM is loaded?
[18:11:35] <shoky> _hello_welt_: depends what you mean by "loaded".  the html will be parsed into the DOM tree
[18:11:37] <TimCoal> just close that with }
[18:11:45] <TimCoal> ;($(function() {
[18:11:53] <TimCoal> })
[18:12:37] <TimCoal> ignore me its the weekend
[18:12:44] <_hello_welt_> shoky, how will TimCoals method of ($(function...) prevent the code from being executed until all the HTML has been parsed into the DOM tree?
[18:12:54] <TimCoal> too late too high to think properly
[18:13:05] <shoky> _hello_welt_:  $(function..)  is the same as $(document).ready(function..)
[18:21:13] <_hello_welt_> I have a collection of $('[data-blah]') elements; what is a good way to get all the values that data-blah is set to? I thought create empty array, loop through with $.each and store value if it is not there. But I thought there is probably a better way.
[18:22:20] <shoky> _hello_welt_ .map will create such an array for you. e.g.  var blahs = $('[data-blah]').map(function() { return $(this).data('blah') }).get();
[18:22:53] <shoky> similar to regular array's .map
[18:24:26] <_hello_welt_> shoky, ty
[18:36:53] <_hello_welt_> shoky, you say $('[data-blah]').map, but documentation for map shows only $.map(array, function() { ... });
[18:37:20] <shoky> _hello_welt_: http://api.jquery.com/map/
[18:39:18] <_hello_welt_> ty
[18:53:35] <_hello_welt_> shoky, i am doing a small plugin to coexist with other plugins, would you suggest that i create an empty object inside my $(document).ready function, var my_plugin_name = {}, and create all my variables as elements of this object?
[18:55:10] <_hello_welt_> ^anyone may answer :)
[18:55:43] <shoky> _hello_welt_: whatever seems best for you.. kinda hard to give advice without knowing anything about what you're doing or plan to have there
[18:56:02] <shoky> usually if you have your isolated code inside a function,
[18:56:24] <shoky> you can just use local variables inside that function,  no need to namespacethem inside another object
[18:57:04] <shoky> but.. totally depends what this "plugin" is and how it's meant to coexist with others, etc..
[18:57:06] <_hello_welt_> so i am safe if I have everything inside a $(document).ready(function() { ...? I thought that all $(document).ready functions may be merged into one block of code that is executed when the document is ready
[18:57:29] <shoky> "safe"? what does that mean :)
[18:57:53] <_hello_welt_> from variable naming conflicts with other scripts that are being loaded
[18:58:03] <shoky> and uhh no , functions are not merged into one
[18:58:26] <shoky> functions give a local scope to variables you define inside
[18:58:38] <shoky> function() {  var local = 'hi';  }
[18:58:51] <shoky> it won't conflict with local in another function
[18:59:33] <shoky> don't use globals and you shouldn't have any conflicts
[19:01:30] <_hello_welt_> ty
[19:26:45] <_hello_welt_> shoky, at the start of my script i set up some globals and a few custom error handlers. I would like to move all of this to the end, for clarity, but I cannot simply put it all in a function, setup() and define it last because of scoping. What would you suggest?
[19:27:55] <_hello_welt_> ^anyone may answer
[19:28:07] <shoky> _hello_welt_: sorry i don't understand the problem.. a jsfiddle would help
[19:29:01] <_hello_welt_> I have a lot of 'setup' code, and I'd like to put all this in a function and move it to the end of my script, but if I wrap all this setup code inside a function, i can't access it outside of that function
[19:29:27] <shoky> i don't see why not. show an example
[19:30:28] <shoky> setup();  .....   function setup() { ... }
[19:32:10] <_hello_welt_> https://jsfiddle.net/zrtzm2zy/1/
[19:32:46] <shoky> _hello_welt_: if you want to access them outside then declare them outside
[19:33:23] <_hello_welt_> i have quite a few of them to declare which i do not like at the start of the script
[19:33:57] <shoky> if they are used in the middle of the script then they should be declared at the top, not at the bottom...
[19:34:23] <shoky> you can declare them at the bottom if you want, you can still access them because of js hoisting.. but i don't see why
[19:34:35] <shoky> https://jsfiddle.net/zrtzm2zy/2/
[19:35:25] <shoky> as you can see this works the same but it's just confusing (bad) code - https://jsfiddle.net/zrtzm2zy/3/
[19:35:25] <_hello_welt_> ty

[20:38:51] <xymantec> success:function(response) is my problem, it gives me null back from the api.php even tho its gets a value printed for example, "success"
[20:40:40] <shoky> xymantec: "success" with the quotes or not?  is the response valid json
[20:40:47] <xymantec> without
[20:40:51] <shoky> you should add an error handler too
[20:40:51] <xymantec> or any string
[20:40:56] <shoky> if without then it's not valid json
[20:41:01] <shoky> you're probably getting a parse error
[20:41:13] <xymantec> I am checking my console log but see nothing
[20:41:22] <shoky> add an error handler to the $.ajax
[20:43:46] <xymantec> ok

[23:39:57] <alturic> hey guys, I'm using a return to .splice an array and I'm looking to run a console.log after the array is spliced is there anyway to do it since on return the function stops executing?
