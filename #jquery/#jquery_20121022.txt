[00:00:01] <Cork> raj: html5 state can yes
[00:00:15] <Cork> if $.history modifies that one, then that works
[00:00:23] <raj> i believe it does
[00:00:24] <Cork> but not all browsers support that
[00:00:28] <raj> k
[00:00:34] <raj> that would be too easy
[00:00:41] <Cork> ie as always :)
[00:00:57] <raj> REDDDDMMOOOONNNNNDDDDDD!!!!
[00:12:23] <GoSox> if you drop support for IE8 and below, life becomes much more joyful
[00:13:57] <raj> IE8 can do that?
[00:14:32] <GoSox> i think you misread what i said
[00:15:26] <heyho_> hello all, iam looking for a jquery fade plugin, which can contain an video. that fader should stop when the video is running
[00:15:37] <Cork> but ie8 isn't really something you can drop today
[00:16:41] <GoSox> i disagree
[00:16:56] <GoSox> on my most popular website, use is down to about 5%
[00:23:36] <h20> quit
[00:30:56] <heyho_> i found iview :-)

[03:22:46] <dns-away> hello guy
[03:23:47] <beachandbytes> hello dns-away
[03:25:23] <dns-away> nc
[03:25:30] <dns-away> ;'-)
[03:25:31] <CathaliN> anyone here who knows Kendo UI?
[03:26:37] <dns-away> hi be
[03:26:44] <dns-away> :)
[03:26:49] <beachandbytes> Cathalin whats your question about it
[03:29:03] <CathaliN> I have a treeview and grid..
[03:29:30] <CathaliN> the tree is formed by networks and subnetworks and meters (like folders and files in Windows Explorer)
[03:29:42] <CathaliN> the grid contains data from the meters
[03:30:30] <CathaliN> I want that when I click on a network or on a meter the grid to be filled with the data recording to the network or meter
[03:30:50] <CathaliN> a network can have one or more meters
[03:31:33] <CathaliN> Iâ€™m using Kendo to create the tree and the grid
[03:31:59] <iRiz0> jQuery Combo
[03:32:14] <iRiz0> .-)
[03:32:21] <iRiz0> `-)
[03:32:51] <beachandbytes> Cathalin okay
[03:33:39] <CathaliN> when I click on a network or on a meter, I want the grid to be changed with the parameters of the meter (or the meters, if the network contains two or more meters)
[03:34:08] <beachandbytes> hook up an event to the click
[03:34:17] <beachandbytes> and get the viewmodel for the grid
[03:35:22] <CathaliN> how?
[03:36:16] <beachandbytes> $('.meter').click(function () { //Do Something to load viewmodel });
[03:44:41] <pingec> how does the .data() mechanism work?
[03:44:53] <pingec> How is data stored and associated with an element?
[03:46:04] <iRiz0> data is.() array.
[03:47:18] <pingec> what does that mean?
[03:48:46] <beachandbytes> given an alement you can couple data with it
[03:54:19] <beachandbytes> pingec http://jsfiddle.net/UaHs2/
[04:02:19] <pingec> beachandbytes yes i understand how to use it
[04:02:29] <pingec> i was jsut wodnering how it works
[04:02:33] <pingec> internally
[04:04:19] <reloadz> can anyone help me wuth this? print option in Opera dosen't work http://jsfiddle.net/Bgjvc/
[04:05:06] <reloadz> can anyone help me with this? print option in Opera doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/Bgjvc/
[04:07:26] <beachandbytes> pengec I would guess a hash table
[04:10:42] <CathaliN> beachandbytes: http://pastebin.com/AcdvEMUm
[04:10:47] <CathaliN> look on that paste
[04:11:16] <CathaliN> the tree gets his networks and subnetworks, also the meters from a JSON url
[04:11:24] <CathaliN> and the grid is also from a JSON
[04:16:42] <CathaliN> beachandbytes: are you still there?
[04:19:46] <amitev> hi all
[04:21:00] <guy> I am confused, $ map() returns array, right? (e.g. sortable_list.find('li').map(function(){ return $(this).data('order'); })) but the .join() method is not available (?!)
[04:24:58] <Tumulte> Hey !
[04:26:12] <seutje> guy: map isn't called on jquery collections, is it?
[04:27:06] <seutje> guy: oh wait nvm, it is
[04:28:56] <seutje> guy: ah, my bad, u just have to run get on it first, as it returns a jquery collection
[04:29:10] <seutje> e.g. sortable_list.find('li').map(function(){ return $(this).data('order'); })).get().join(', ');
[04:29:37] <reloadz> can anyone help me with this? print option in Opera doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/Bgjvc/
[04:30:15] <guy> seutje: Thanks.
[04:32:29] <seutje> reloadz: think opera requires window.onload to have fired before being able to call window.print
[04:32:51] <coachz> hi
[04:33:08] <modles> hello, any raphael nuts here?
[04:33:17] <coachz> Can anyone tell me what the best free datatable for jQuery is please ?
[04:33:40] <modles> coachz:  jquery widgets
[04:33:59] <coachz> this?  http://jqueryui.com/widget/
[04:34:12] <modles> nope
[04:34:35] <modles> http://www.jqwidgets.com/jquery-widgets-demo/demos/jqxgrid/index.htm
[04:34:36] <modles> that
[04:35:08] <coachz> jqxGrid being the datatable widget ?
[04:35:23] <modles> we may be talking cross purposes
[04:35:31] <modles> i thought you meant a table frontend
[04:35:37] <reloadz> seutje: i open in l38 and print in l92
[04:35:38] <coachz> i am
[04:35:38] <modles> sortable, filterable etc
[04:35:54] <coachz> yes, with the ability to format data and validate before ajax calls
[04:36:15] <guy> probably a rare thing to ask.. though how to get the length of string intersection? eg. 'abc45' and the other string is 'abc54', then the desired result is 3
[04:36:33] <coachz> what i see so far looks really good
[04:36:42] <coachz> do you know if it can validate input too ?
[04:36:50] <modles> never used it
[04:37:09] <coachz> ok, i'll read up on it, thank you,  you just know that it's a popular one ?
[04:37:18] <modles> yep
[04:37:54] <coachz> thanks so much :-)
[04:56:38] <volga> I am new to jquery
[04:56:46] <coachz> enjoy the ride
[04:58:09] <volga> I would like to get information about the jquery tab scroller  like dojo tab container
[04:58:09] <Chris_CC> hi guys i have "var num_likes = (num_likes + 1)" and it returns "01" instead of just "1" how do i make sure it doesnt add the 0 prefix?
[04:58:33] <volga> like http://archive.dojotoolkit.org/nightly/dojotoolkit/dijit/tests/layout/test_TabContainer.html

[04:58:41] <volga> can anybody pls help
[04:58:42] <seutje> ?parseint @ Chris_CC
[04:58:44] <Cork> Chris_CC: your num_likes is a string not a number
[04:58:47] <bot-t> seutje, Couldn't find "parseint & Chris_CC" in jQuery Docs.
[04:58:47] <bot-t> Chris_CC, remove "parseInt" and speed up some div - Bug Tracker - jQuery - Opened 2 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4311

[04:59:03] <bot-t> seutje, Couldn't find "going coo coo" in jQuery Docs.
[04:59:10] <seutje> OH SHADDAP
[04:59:15] <Cork> :)
[04:59:25] <Chris_CC> Thanks Cork :)
[04:59:26] <seutje> Chris_CC: yeah, that mdn link was what I wanted to reference you to
[04:59:34] <seutje> make sure u add a radix
[04:59:37] <Chris_CC> thanks also seutje  ^^
[04:59:38] <Cork> ya
[04:59:44] <seutje> or 0 indexed numbers might be counted as octal
[04:59:52] <Chris_CC> darix??
[04:59:53] <seutje> or some shit
[04:59:57] <Chris_CC> radix*
[04:59:58] <volga> can anybody pls help
[05:00:04] <seutje> parseInt('098787687', 10) <- the 10
[05:00:16] <coachz> What do you guys like to use to make the web page structure: header, sidebar, body, footer.  Is there a widget that makes resizable areas ?
[05:00:23] <seutje> to tell it that u want it interpreted as a base-10 number (AKA decimal)
[05:00:38] <Cork> volga: your looking for jquery-ui tab?
[05:00:46] <volga> yes sir
[05:00:51] <seutje> wonder what spec bot-t runs
[05:00:55] <Cork> ?g jquery-ui tab
[05:00:57] <bot-t> Cork, Tabs | jQuery UI - http://jqueryui.com/tabs/
[05:01:02] <seutje> ?eval parseInt('000979876876');
[05:01:06] <bot-t> seutje: 0
[05:01:13] <seutje> ?eval parseInt('000979876876', 10);
[05:01:15] <bot-t> seutje: 979876876
[05:01:15] <Chris_CC> I'm lost.. is this needed if it's no longer a string?
[05:01:19] <sbugzu> num_likes/1+1
[05:01:24] <Cork> no
[05:01:32] <coachz> I guess what I'm asking for is what you use for jQuery layouts
[05:01:34] <Chris_CC> cool cool :) thanks think i understand :)
[05:01:40] <Cork> Chris_CC: all this convo is moot if its not a string :)
[05:01:46] <seutje> yeah
[05:01:51] <Chris_CC> haha ok ^^ good to know though still
[05:01:54] <volga> cork i have implemented the same but i want the tab to scroll
[05:02:07] <Cork> volga: "to scroll" ??
[05:02:18] <Cork> you mean switch on an interval?
[05:02:23] <volga> no
[05:02:31] <Cork> or that the tabbar should overflow?
[05:02:35] <seutje> u can also force a typecast to a number by putting a + in front, but it's considered awkward by some ppl
[05:02:39] <volga> but if the tabs are more than the screen size they should scroll
[05:02:49] <Cork> ah
[05:02:58] <Cork> you would have to do that your self
[05:03:45] <volga> sir dojo is providing the facility of tab container
[05:03:52] <Chris_CC> another quick question,. i want to change the html of something, but  wish to add a var in the middle .. what is the correct way to do this? this is what i have 						$('#like'+shout_id).html('<em>'+num_likes'</em>UNLIKE')
[05:04:03] <seutje> I've always wondered, since you can foo++ and u can ++foo, why can't you ++foo--? :P
[05:04:09] <volga> sir I am very new to jquery just started today
[05:04:17] <volga> so can u guide me for the same cork
[05:04:31] <Chris_CC> oo nvm forgot a +
[05:04:34] <seutje> Chris_CC: that works, if u add a + :P
[05:04:48] <Chris_CC> seutje: haha yea,I'm a bit slower than normal today
[05:04:52] <Chris_CC> cheers :)
[05:05:07] <seutje> some ppl might frown upon the fact ur not using templates
[05:05:07] <Chris_CC> woo i can do jquery me :D
[05:05:17] <seutje> but it depends on the size/complexity of your project if it's worth it
[05:05:38] <Chris_CC> seutje: templates comment aimed at me?
[05:06:04] <seutje> Chris_CC: yeah, sry
[05:06:25] <Chris_CC> seutje: how do you mean templates, my project is HUGE www.carclubbed.com
[05:06:48] <Chris_CC> a lot of custom content needed, building from the ground up
[05:08:39] <seutje> Chris_CC: well, instead of rebuilding the (essentially) same markup all the time, it might be interesting to define a couple templates and just reuse those
[05:09:22] <seutje> Chris_CC: here's a simple example of the idea http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/
[05:10:06] <seutje> (there's about a million other flavours of templating engines for js btw)
[05:11:34] <Chris_CC> I'l be honest, that went STRAIGHT over my head lol
[05:11:44] <Chris_CC> only got into web dev in Jan
[05:11:57] <Chris_CC> so these kind of concepts are brand new to me
[05:12:24] <Chris_CC> sites pretty much down now anyway, so if it goes well i'l hire one of you code monkeys to do a better job anyway :P lol
[05:13:15] <coachz> Anyone have recommendations for doing layouts in jQuery?
[05:14:43] <coachz> I guess i should do CSS layouts
[05:15:03] <onr> 960.gs
[05:15:22] <sbugzu> coachz: masonry.desandro.com
[05:15:26] <coachz> onr, is that one css ?
[05:15:35] <onr> yup pure css
[05:15:35] <Cork> volga: that might be a bit complicated depending on what you want to do
[05:15:39] <seutje> Chris_CC: for example, if you periodically grab a bunch of data (say... employee data like names and function) and you want to present these in the same markup every time
[05:15:42] <coachz> sbugzu:  i'm guessing i should use css so if javascript is disabled it will work
[05:15:46] <coachz> onr: thx
[05:15:57] <Cork> volga: but basically setting overflow: hidden; max-width: on the tab should get you starting
[05:16:01] <seutje> Chris_CC: then it might become interesting to detach the markup from the data, so they can live independently
[05:16:08] <Cork> volga: then you need to set the animation with .animate
[05:16:33] <seutje> Chris_CC: so then u just put one snippet in the page that represents the markup with placeholders to represent the data
[05:17:17] <seutje> Chris_CC: then when you grab your data, you can just iterate over it and call ur templater, which will then fill in the placeholders in your markup and render you one per data-item
[05:17:27] <seutje> k, nvm, I really suck at explaining shit like this
[05:18:17] <Chris_CC> seutje: ohhh so it's a way of basically predefininy variables within data returns?
[05:18:25] <Chris_CC> predefining*
[05:18:35] <seutje> uhm, I guess
[05:19:07] <seutje> Chris_CC: also, if your backend runs on node.js, you can use the same templates back- and front-end :D
[05:19:13] <seutje> like twig
[05:19:23] <Chris_CC> no idea what front/backend is :P
[05:19:25] <Chris_CC> haha brb :P
[05:30:31] <Dr4g> Trying to make a map of 'id' => structure.
[05:30:33] <Dr4g> geoJsonMap[option.data('regionid')] = response;
[05:30:46] <Dr4g> but when i console.log(geoJsonMap) the key is undefined :/
[05:30:59] <Dr4g> where did i go wrong ?
[05:31:57] <Cork> whats jeoJsonMap?
[05:32:00] <Cork> an object?
[05:32:20] <Dr4g> array
[05:32:26] <Dr4g> var geoJsonMap = [], geoLatLongMap = [];
[05:32:36] <Dr4g> option.data('regionid') is an integer.
[05:32:38] <Cork> uh, you can't have keys in arrays
[05:32:51] <Cork> var geoJsonMap = {}, geoLatLongMap = {};
[05:33:01] <Dr4g> it's not a key it's a numerical index.
[05:33:08] <Dr4g> geoJsonMap[16]
[05:33:17] <faraway> Dr4g: well i think option.data('regionid') returns undefined, so you need to look where and how regionid is set
[05:33:18] <Cork> then you use geoJsonMap.push(response)
[05:33:31] <Cork> Dr4g: arrays can't have jumps in them
[05:33:44] <Dr4g> Cork: i want to make a map so I can cache results by 'regionid' and check if it exists in the structure at a later date.
[05:34:05] <Dr4g> to avoid duplicate XHR requests.
[05:34:13] <Cork> then you want=> var geoJsonMap = {}; geoJsonMap[option.data('regionid')] = response
[05:34:26] <Dr4g> ok i'll try object
[05:34:52] <Cork> if the key is undefined its cause option.data doesn't find the regionid
[05:35:15] <Cork> but you should NEVER try to set a key position on an array, that will cause all kind of weird problems
[05:36:12] <faraway> Dr4g: at least in chrome if option.data('regionid') is undefind it woul dnot be added to the array ... if option.data('regionid') is e.g. 5 and the array is empty the indexes until 5 will be filled with undefied
[05:36:56] <Dr4g> Cork what's the best approach of checking if the key geoJsonMap[15] exists?
[05:36:59] <Dr4g> typeof ?
[05:38:01] <faraway> Dr4g: if(  "15" in geoJsonMap )
[05:38:06] <Dr4g> ok
[05:38:39] <faraway> Dr4g: ah wait .. not sure if hasOwnProperty is better
[05:39:14] <Dr4g> faraway: how would i invert this to see if it doesn't exist
[05:39:15] <Dr4g> if(regionID in geoJsonMap) {
[05:39:21] <Dr4g> if(!regionID in geoJsonMap) ?
[05:39:26] <lalalala> can someone please help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/DcLC8/ ?
[05:39:29] <Dr4g> i think it may invert regionID if i try that.
[05:39:36] <faraway> Dr4g: geoJsonMap.hasOwnProperty("15") is saver
[05:39:46] <Dr4g> is it browser compliant ?
[05:39:46] <sunbeam> i've got a site, where the background (full width 2000px) should always fully fill the screen
[05:39:50] <Dr4g> i don't wanna use no experimental stuff.
[05:39:52] <sunbeam> any idea how I can do this best?
[05:40:08] <sunbeam> (fill the screen horizontally, vertically not necessary)
[05:40:34] <faraway> Dr4g: most of the case you won't have problems with  "in" but e.g. "toString" in obj would return ture even if you have not added it cause it is in the proto chain
[05:41:02] <faraway> Dr4g: so do geoJsonMap.hasOwnProperty("15")  or !geoJsonMap.hasOwnProperty("15") depending on if you want to see it it is in the object or not
[05:41:18] <Dr4g> faraway: yep, i'm getting there, will gist it soon.
[05:43:15] <lalalalala> can someone please help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/DcLC8/
[05:43:15] <lalalalala> ?
[05:43:43] <modles> not loading for me
[05:44:37] <faraway> lalalalala: $.ajax is async the function does not return the think you return in the complete callback
[05:44:44] <dotDeeka> lalalala I believe the problem is $.ajax is async, so your generateRooms() function returns before the ajax request is complete. I suppose a quick fix would be to set the async opt to false?
[05:46:34] <Dr4g> faraway: here's the end result, i have it working :) https://gist.github.com/95cbe04b2ee13a9a79e3
[05:46:37] <lalalalala> thank you
[05:46:46] <Dr4g> it's saving the ajax results in the maps, and avoiding duplicate ajax requests :)
[05:47:24] <Dr4g> faraway: what do you think of the code ?
[05:48:46] <faraway> Dr4g: the only think i see is that, you still could have duplicate ajax request
[05:50:00] <faraway> Dr4g: and the rest .. well don't have time to think over the whole code if it is good or not right now ;)
[05:51:31] <faraway> Dr4g: something makes the code not so readable is the return, adding an else would be a little bit clearer to read
[05:51:35] <xec_> ?ajax101 @ lalalalala
[05:51:36] <bot-t> lalalalala, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[05:51:46] <xec_> ?async @ dotDeeka
[05:51:46] <bot-t> dotDeeka, NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the userâ€™s ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[05:53:34] <Chris_CC> erugh ... who would of thought that turning things from forms into jquery/ajax would be so much faffing about! Wheres the damn "make site" button!

[05:56:33] <Chris_CC> xec_: haha well i did learn a few things so not a total waste :P
[05:57:15] <xec_> faraway: you mean *the* first result, if you google for "jquery ajax form" :D

[06:02:49] <eizdealer> hey guys, i have a jquery ui autocomplete but i also need to make changes to the underlying select directly - how can i make sure that the autocomplete changes when i change the selects?
[06:04:04] <Cork> Dr4g: varname[16] === undefined
[06:04:38] <Cork> Dr4g: in is a bit risky as not all browsers support it
[06:04:53] <kam187-rMBP> hey guys
[06:05:17] <Dr4g> Cork what about hasOwnProperty
[06:05:26] <Dr4g> is that experimental too ?
[06:05:38] <Cork> thats a safe way to check yes
[06:05:48] <Cork> even safer then === undefined
[06:08:14] <seutje> eizdealer: I'm confused, do you edit the input field or the returned list of results?
[06:09:42] <eizdealer> seutje: well, essentially what i want to accomplish is: i have two lists with stops, for both i'm using the combobox code from the examples. i want to have a button that swaps the content of the two comboboxes
[06:10:23] <eizdealer> i thought the easiest way to do this would be to simply swap the underlying <select> items but that didn't show in the comboboxes..
[06:11:54] <softmanpetro> can I chechk if the current field was modified before submit is pressed /
[06:12:10] <eip56> morning all
[06:12:18] <xec_> afternoon
[06:12:34] <anli> Will :animated be true for an animated div forever?
[06:12:50] <anli> Seems like I dont get a count of 0 animated divs in my component any longer...
[06:15:19] <faraway> anli: are you sure you call the selector when all animations are done ?
[06:15:26] <Cork> anli: it will return true for all elements that matches the selector that has an active animation timer
[06:15:42] <anli> And when an animation has ended, that timer will not be active?
[06:15:51] <Cork> yes
[06:16:01] <seutje> eizdealer: removing them @ runtime works fine for me
[06:16:19] <anli> Can I have the timer inactive instead?
[06:16:37] <Cork> anli: no
[06:16:47] <anli> So :animated is of no use then, ok
[06:16:53] <Cork> anli: explain what your trying to do instead
[06:16:56] <eizdealer> seutje: i think i will have to destroy the combobox widget and build it again, otherwise it won't take the changes to the <select> into account?
[06:17:04] <Cork> sounds like :animated isn't what you want
[06:17:26] <anli> Cork: What I want to do is to know if any element is animated
[06:17:44] <seutje> eizdealer: again, works fine for me: http://jsfiddle.net/fXzh4/
[06:17:44] <anli> Now I described what I want to do instead of describing what I want to do
[06:18:15] <Cork> anli: a better option is prob to set a class on the element, and remove it when you want to unflag it
[06:18:20] <seutje> eizdealer: it evaluates the results on change, so it doesn't matter afaict
[06:18:37] <anli> So I need to implement :animated myself then
[06:18:39] <anli> Right?
[06:18:45] <Cork> uh, no
[06:19:00] <eizdealer> seutje: if i show the underlying select and change it (i.e. select another entry) the change won't show in the combobox :/
[06:19:01] <anli> I take it as yes, thanks a lot
[06:19:11] <Cork> anli: just .addClass('animating').animate(-.., function() { $(this).removeClass('animating'); }
[06:19:25] <anli> Cork: yeah, exactly
[06:19:30] <anli> I will do that
[06:19:31] <seutje> eizdealer: what?
[06:19:41] <eizdealer> ^^
[06:19:53] <seutje> eizdealer: so u want to select something in the real select and have it show up?
[06:19:59] <eizdealer> seutje: exactly
[06:20:00] <Cork> anli: and again, there is prob better ways to solve the original problem
[06:20:20] <eizdealer> seutje: because in the end, the select is what will be sent to the server right?
[06:20:47] <seutje> eizdealer: not sure why ur asking me this, but I suppose
[06:21:24] <anli> Cork: I doubt there is a better way, and I hate speculating ;9
[06:21:30] <eizdealer> hehe ok i'll try to play with it some more. thx!
[06:22:38] <eizdealer> mmh how would i get access to widget objects if i don't save a handle on creation?
[06:22:38] <Cork> anli: you don't leave much other choice as you don't explain the problem; theres rarely a need to find if an animation has ended though a selector
[06:22:45] <Cork> anli: theres callbacks for that
[06:22:55] <Cork> anli: and thats most of the time the correct way to solve ti
[06:23:00] <Cork> *it
[06:23:02] <seutje> eizdealer: http://jsfiddle.net/fXzh4/2/
[06:23:21] <seutje> simply add a change handler on ur input to set the value on the next input
[06:23:31] <eizdealer> oh cool that's awesome
[06:23:39] <seutje> I used $('select').on('change', function() { $(this).next('.ui-combobox').find('input').val(this.value); });
[06:23:47] <seutje> but u might wanna scope that
[06:24:03] <seutje> not entirely sure what the point of this is though
[06:24:13] <seutje> wouldn't u only see that "real" select when JS is disabled?
[06:24:38] <seutje> like, I can imagine u'd want to map the fake select to the real select, but the other way around seems... silly
[06:25:57] <eizdealer> well i could map the fake to real or the other way round, doesn't really make a differene
[06:26:19] <eizdealer> i just want to swap the selected values, both for the real and fake selects
[06:26:25] <seutje> eizdealer: also, u can get access to the widget stuff by going $('#combobox').autocomplete('widget') iirc
[06:26:38] <eizdealer> ah that's helpful
[06:26:38] <eizdealer> thx
[06:26:56] <anli> Cork: Was really easy implementing your tip, http://pastebin.com/Qv7PyErQ
[06:27:33] <kobra> hello all, i am using .css to determine the top position of a div, how can i subsctract a certain value from it always like top: (height) - 40px, here is the code i am using http://pastebin.com/3E5pAfBm
[06:27:56] <seutje> eizdealer: actually, u need to call it on the input created afterwards
[06:27:58] <soee> guys how can i get ome div with all attributes and content ?
[06:28:15] <seutje> because combobox is sort of a custom solution
[06:28:19] <Cork> kobra: you can't
[06:28:38] <Cork> kobra: you would have to bind something that informs you that the value has changed and recalculate
[06:28:49] <Cork> (an event, a function call or similar)
[06:29:01] <kobra> cork: how do i then set the top position of a div element same as the height of document
[06:29:32] <kobra> http://198.58.86.52/~rondaf/ see this website i want the #wrapper to be position exactly top: 100% kind of
[06:29:44] <kobra> full screen slideshow, then that wrapper
[06:29:59] <kobra> right now its adding the height of #top also in that
[06:30:33] <Cork> kobra: why not just set it bottom: 0; ?
[06:30:58] <kobra> bottom won't position it bottom of the document ?
[06:31:21] <Cork> i don't really follow
[06:31:38] <eip56> Im not really following you either
[06:31:46] <eip56> Cork what div do you want where
[06:31:53] <eip56> sorry kobra
[06:31:55] <Cork> position: absolute; bottom: 0; will put it at the end of the document; position: fixed; bottom: 0; will put it on the end of the viewport
[06:32:12] <kobra> #wrapper to start below the slideshow
[06:32:21] <kobra> so when people visit site, they see slideshow only
[06:32:38] <kobra> right now the #wrapper is over the slideshow
[06:32:52] <Cork> ah, you want to offset it from the view
[06:33:13] <Dirkos> What is best way to fix it? The extra override in the UI Autocomplete generates an error when the object does not exists: http://jsfiddle.net/Dqf68/2/
[06:33:24] <Cork> kobra: so position: absolute; top: 100%;
[06:33:41] <kobra> i did do top:100% hmm absolute maybe did not
[06:33:51] <Cork> ya, relative won't do what you want
[06:34:06] <kobra> ah ok thanks
[06:34:42] <pedda> any kinetic.js users around ?
[06:34:49] <eip56> Why dont you hide it then capture it at some point kobra
[06:34:54] <docmur> What does contain return?  I have code that on button click creates a div with an appended ID id="chat'+id+'",  I'm trying to find if this has been created by using $('#chatBox:contains('#chat'+id'')');  However ever once I have 1 box created every chat+id seems to match so if I created chat12,  chat8 will tell me that it's box existsw
[06:35:07] <kobra> that did it cork thanks !
[06:35:12] <Cork> np :)
[06:35:19] <kobra> eip: don't wanna hide it
[06:35:23] <zatan> hey how can I say for example $('foo' and 'bar').hover ?
[06:35:23] <Cork> eip56: that would need js when its not needed
[06:35:33] <kobra> yep
[06:35:35] <Cork> zatan: comma
[06:35:48] <Cork> $('foo, bar')
[06:35:53] <Dirkos> Cork, u know why this gives an error? http://jsfiddle.net/Dqf68/2/
[06:35:55] <eip56> progressive enhancement? css hide it?
[06:35:59] <eip56> just my thoughts
[06:36:01] <Dirkos> only happens if the object does not exists
[06:36:25] <zatan> Cork, how about OR ?
[06:36:43] <Cork> zatan: css doens't have or
[06:37:12] <Cork> Dirkos: your looking for a value set by autocomplete; if no elements are found autocomplete doesn't set it
[06:37:24] <Cork> so ._renderItem wibät exist
[06:37:44] <Cork> Dirkos: you need to check if data('autocomplete') !== undefined
[06:38:00] <zatan> Cork,  cheers
[06:38:08] <Dirkos> hmm is that possible to add in the register the way i do it?
[06:38:22] <Cork> no you need to split it up
[06:38:34] <Dirkos> ah shit
[06:38:36] <Cork> you way of doing it has other problems too
[06:38:42] <Dirkos> $(obj).length? would work too right?
[06:38:51] <Cork> cause it assumes theres ever only one autocomplete element
[06:39:10] <Dirkos> well its written this way in the docs (crappy implementation but ok)
[06:39:23] <Dirkos> the new autocomplete from UI wont return HTML anymore
[06:39:30] <Chris_CC> i have a problem ... i have some jquery that handles some ajax and updates, however i need to "refresh" this script once another jquery is pressed... is there a way to do that without re-writting it all / having a new script
[06:39:35] <Cork> Dirkos: http://jsfiddle.net/Dqf68/3/
[06:39:52] <Dirkos> Cork thanks! will try :)
[06:40:11] <Cork> each grantees that you have an element so :)
[06:41:40] <Dirkos> yeah i see, didnt thought about that :)
[06:44:08] <jalves> Hi all, anynone experienced with jquery-templates can help me to solve a problem?
[06:49:19] <Chris_CC> Can anyone help? I have some jquery that performs some ajax and updates the local version for feedback, however when i click another link (which in turn uses jquery/ajax to update the page) and i want to click the SAME type of button within the new content, it won;t work becuase that content wasn't loaded before and therefore isnt associated with jquery... how do i fix this? example here www.carclubbed.com user bmw_z3_1@email.com pas
[06:49:37] <Chris_CC> click on the like button to see the result, then expand a shout that has comments and click the like button in one of the comments, and it wont work
[06:51:05] <ec8or> Chris_CC: use $(document).on('click', '.buttonClass', function() {});
[06:51:29] <Chris_CC> ec8or: thank you :)
[06:51:48] <dotDeeka> Chris_CC: are you using jQuery.click() to bind your event handlers?
[06:53:04] <Chris_CC> dotDeeka: yes
[06:57:01] <dotDeeka> I didn't see the post from ec8or, he is correct. the jQuery.on() uses event delegation to fire events on elements that were not present in the dom on page load. jQuery.click() does not do that.
[06:57:40] <Chris_CC> ec8or: I can;t seem to get that to work, here is my jquery, how would i go about amending it? http://pastebin.com/aspA8Vb6
[06:58:05] <Chris_CC> dotDeeka: ahhh ok let me try again, thanks
[06:59:04] <Chris_CC> dotDeeka: ec8or , sorted :) thanks ..
[06:59:31] <ec8or> Chris_CC: cool
[07:00:09] <dotDeeka> Chris_CC, glad I could help a little.
[07:00:46] <Chris_CC> need all the help i can get ^^ much easier asking here than trying to find this stuff in google when my knowledge is so limited, so appricate any input i can get :)
[07:02:52] <rmurphey> Chris_CC: have you tried reading any books about jquery?
[07:03:39] <Chris_CC> rmurphey: nope, nothing like that I've only been learning for 10 months now ... bit of a silly project to learn something fresh :P
[07:03:57] <rmurphey> i'd recommend checking out some books like learning jquery, jquery enlightenment, and jquery fundamentals
[07:04:19] <rmurphey> they're all rather quick reads and will get you a lot farther than asking questions in here
[07:04:39] <Chris_CC> rmurphey: I would love to but unfortunately time is a constraint and if this falls through i will go back into Games, so don;t have that luxury to learn as indepth as i would like just yet
[07:05:17] <Chris_CC> i pickup concepts and such pretty quick, but my memory is appauling so i have trouble keeping lots of information down, just been tackeling the project 1 stewp at a time and it's almost there now :)
[07:06:43] <jomofcw> Hello !
[07:07:05] <jomofcw> Is there an easy way to detect any change in a form, please ?
[07:07:22] <Cork> no
[07:07:39] <blink0> can anyone help me out? I'm trying to bind functions to page elements via an array - when I do them one by one everything works, but via the array it doesn't - I really don't get why not -- http://pastebin.com/TkgDEDe0
[07:08:01] <Cork> jomofcw: the best you can get is $('form').on('change', 'input, select, textarea', function() {})
[07:08:22] <Cork> jomofcw: but that will have a delay for somethings
[07:08:46] <jomofcw> Cork hello ! Thanks. What do you mean by "delay" ?
[07:08:57] <jomofcw> Like something need to lost focus to trigger "change" ?
[07:10:21] <Cork> exactly
[07:10:49] <Cork> some of the elements won't send the change event until the focus is changed
[07:13:44] <eizdealer> how can i subscribe to an autocomplete widget change?
[07:14:55] <eizdealer> i tried: $( ".bb-combobox" ).combobox().change(function(event){ alert('asdf'); });
[07:14:59] <eizdealer> but it didn't work
[07:17:58] <eizdealer> the combobox itself works well, and there's no js error
[07:18:06] <jomofcw> ty Cork !
[07:22:29] <sunbeam> i've got a site, where the background (full width 2000px) should always fully fill the screen
[07:22:33] <sunbeam> any idea how I can do this best?
[07:22:34] <sunbeam> (fill the screen horizontally, vertically not necessary)
[07:22:49] <fALSO> background-repeat

[07:26:47] <hirsty> anyone good with datepickers?
[07:27:10] <eizdealer> hirsty: what do you need?
[07:27:57] <hirsty> well im having some trouble with slidetoggle and my datepicker
[07:28:29] <hirsty> e.g
[07:29:12] <renobird> hello all, Anyone know of a datepicker that will allow you to select multiple dates *and* times? I found a few that do multiple dates, but no times.
[07:29:24] <hirsty> Click the 26th and information shows, click it again and it hides, click 27th whilst 26th info is shown .....26th info slides in 27th info slides out
[07:30:03] <eizdealer> renobird: why not use several datetime input fields?
[07:30:18] <eizdealer> hirsty: what info?
[07:30:47] <hirsty> just information based on that date in a div :)
[07:31:05] <hirsty> atm im at a stage where it will toggle when the same date is pressed but
[07:31:15] <renobird> eizdealer: the events we have can be on different days throughout the month at different times (never 2 on the same day) â€” mutiple input fields makes for a super messy UI when there can be 15-20 events sometimes
[07:31:26] <hirsty> if the 26th info is out and the 27th is pressed, it only slides in the info
[07:32:16] <eizdealer> hirsty: uhm are you using the jquery datepicker or your own? i'm assuming you have some custom code in there, also?
[07:32:33] <hirsty> using the jquery datepicker
[07:33:08] <hirsty> onclick atm im using slidetoggle
[07:33:31] <eizdealer> renobird: sorry i don't have any experience with that :/ i'm not sure something like this even exists
[07:34:00] <eizdealer> hirsty: can you reproduce on http://jsfiddle.net/ ?
[07:34:10] <renobird> http://multidatespickr.sourceforge.net this multidate picker is a good start, was hoping someone knew of something similar that also incorporated time.
[07:36:17] <eizdealer> renobird: you could try and imitate the behavior of http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker
[07:36:29] <eizdealer> i think it's based on jquery ui datepicker
[07:37:05] <renobird> eizdealer: yeah, I'm using exactly that for the current timepicker. :)
[07:38:26] <hirsty> jsfiddle doesnt seem to like it lol
[07:39:35] <hirsty> sec
[07:41:21] <hirsty> nah too much fer the fiddle to handle lol
[07:43:39] <sunbeam> fALSO: no thats not what i mean
[07:44:12] <gp5st> hello. i have an input box that has a css :focus psuedo selector and a onchange event that submits the form for the box.  In IE, the box executes the :focus selector, then loses focus (not executing the on change handler).  since it doesn't have focus I cannot enter info into the box (obviously). I can't find any javascript that remove focus from the box:-\
[07:48:31] <hirsty> eizdealer: Sorry jsfiddle isnt liking it :( as its javascript/PHP/AJAX and html
[07:48:55] <gp5st> even if i remove all the event handlers i can find and the :focus css I still cannot enter info into the input box:-\ I'm really lost at what to do to find what's causing it to loose focus
[07:49:10] <gp5st> my guess is some poorly written selector, but i just can't find it
[07:49:19] <hirsty> i can give you the related code to the datepicker if that helps?

[07:51:02] <hirsty> or readonly
[07:51:22] <gp5st> hirsty: it gets a style like it's selected and editable, but then looses it

[07:52:08] <gp5st> hirsty: this is a huge application and i don't know how to reproduce it outside of the application:(
[07:52:35] <gp5st> thanks ajpiano
[07:52:45] <ajpiano> no prob, sorry just saw it
[07:53:15] <gp5st> hirsty: that's part of the problem.  I'm not sure how to reproduce it. I've removed all the special styling and event handlers i can find and it still does this
[07:53:42] <hirsty> pastebin ur css so i can look - the stuff relevant to ur input :D
[07:53:44] <gp5st> ajpiano: np:)
[07:56:57] <zafu> hi, the best way to test if a jq object is empty? $('notmatching')
[07:57:28] <snover> ?faq @ zafu
[07:57:29] <bot-t> zafu, FAQ: http://docs.jquery.com/FAQ
[07:58:02] <zafu> ah, length
[07:59:15] <gp5st> hirsty: i can't make a reproducible example page. that's the thing. i'm missing something and i don't know how to find it. is there a way to log every even selector that's executing?
[08:00:29] <hirsty> what browser are you using?
[08:02:38] <gp5st> hirsty: IE 8 :( ;(
[08:02:42] <gp5st> :'(
[08:03:00] <gp5st> i've come to writing a sonnet every day for morning scrum to honour my hatred for it
[08:03:22] <gp5st> this all works in chrome, firefox, and safari...who would have guessed
[08:05:08] <adavia> anyone here tried sending for example an id to the server when an item is selected from autocomplete?
[08:05:39] <gp5st> adavia: are you having an issue doing it?
[08:05:42] <hirsty> get firefox and firedebug :P
[08:05:59] <gp5st> firedebug? or firebug
[08:06:20] <hirsty> firebug my apologies
[08:06:25] <gp5st> i have that
[08:06:31] <gp5st> and the chrome tools
[08:06:42] <gp5st> i wasn't aware i could log all events
[08:06:43] <adavia> gp5st:  actually im trying to do it.. i didnt get enough information related
[08:07:09] <gp5st> adavia: can you be a little more clear? what's the problem you're running into
[08:08:10] <adavia> gp5st:  once i select an item from the autocomplete suggest i need to send the id value instead of the text to the server
[08:08:25] <gp5st> i'm gonna try this: http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event+2
[08:08:37] <hirsty> take a look at ur code with firebug :)
[08:08:59] <gp5st> hirsty: i'm not seeing any events bound to the elment unfortunatly:(
[08:09:31] <gp5st> adavia: ok. the jquery-ui autocomplete will give you the id of the selected element
[08:10:00] <adavia> gp5st:  right.. im getting it from a query
[08:10:19] <gp5st> so, you know have the event...do an ajax call with it?
[08:10:23] <gp5st> have the id*
[08:14:09] <gp5st> visual event showed me there are some ajax hooks doing things that look interesting. i'll start there
[08:17:09] <garulf> Hi guys..
[08:17:19] <imanc> question for you folks - I have to build a series of popups which appear next to elements. I'd typically use fancybox to do this, but I suspect it may be easier to use an absolutely positioned div and some jquery to get the coords of the clicked element. Here's a screen grab of what I'm trying to achieve (the rating popup): http://imgur.com/CQFMF  What do you suggest?
[08:18:05] <garulf> ok.. It seams I speaking of nothing without code, but It will be almost impossible to make ax example. Why if I set to different td.width() a te same width, they aren't of the same width()? Have they have also same style?
[08:19:46] <docmur> what would be the correct way to do this? http://jsfiddle.net/cP4eS/
[08:25:00] <gnat_x> i am using a php file to generate a JSON object. i'm trying to use $.getJSON('ajax.php'), I want to do that in a function, and retur the json object itself, so that i can keep checking on a a timer. i'm rusty on this, and having trouble remembering how to pass the json obj out of the function. what should i be reading up on? pointers also welcome.
[08:25:10] <Ceeram> any ideas why i find this in my apache logs: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1376394590
[08:25:40] <Ceeram> it causing 404s, if i search my application it finds this code in jquery.js
[08:26:20] <BillCriswell> gnat_x: You want $.getJSON('ajax.php', function(result){ result.propertyJawn });
[08:26:33] <BillCriswell> result is the json object.
[08:27:07] <gnat_x> BillCriswell: thanks. i'll try that.
[08:27:24] <gnat_x> this is what i get for doing mostly sys admin for the last couple years. ;P

[08:41:46] <CathaliN> and pass it to a variable
[08:41:49] <gp5st> CathaliN: you'll have to explain your problem

[08:43:36] <CathaliN> and in kendo?
[08:44:12] <gp5st> what's kendo?
[08:44:29] <CathaliN> Kendo UI
[08:44:46] <gp5st> i'm not sure, this is the #jquery channel
[08:45:16] <gp5st> if you're using jquery you should be able just to parse the json you receive and pull the data you want out of it

[08:54:37] <Rajni> hi, quick question ;) i wanna get a span value inside a certain div(id=mydiv), is this synthax right? $('#mydiv span').val() ? i tried this and it returns nothing
[08:55:00] <Rajni> also tried $('#mydiv').find('span').val() and nothing
[08:56:56] <timwis> Hey guys, does $.ajax() allow caching for JSONP requests? I set cache to true but it doesn't seem to be any faster
[08:58:34] <docmur> I'm trying to figure out if a Div already exists by doing var chatWindow = $('#chatBox:contains(#chat'+id+')');   will chatWindow be true / false?
[08:59:59] <docmur> if I alert(chatWindow) i get object and if I alert(chatWindow.val()) it's undefined
[09:00:22] <Rajni> docmur try: chatWindow = $(('#chat'+id).length)
[09:00:28] <huu> !list
[09:03:59] <SoulRaven> hello
[09:04:05] <SoulRaven> please help me with something
[09:04:15] <Rajni> docmur any feedback?
[09:04:18] <SoulRaven> i have a strange problem with jquery UI and tabs
[09:04:35] <SoulRaven> tabs are init ok, but the content from the tabs is not hidden for each tab
[09:04:39] <docmur> ya that doesn't seem to do anything, I can't alert the chatWindow values var chatWindow = $('#chat'+id+'').length;
[09:04:49] <SoulRaven> this behaivor is from when i switch to new version of UI
[09:05:11] <Narhir> my problem is solved
[09:06:13] <Rajni> docmur $(element).length should always return 0 or more depending on how many elements it found
[09:06:21] <Rajni> must be some synthax issue you have there
[09:08:35] <Drager> How can I get the value of a <div?
[09:08:52] <Drager> I want the value inside <div id="test">DATA</dib>
[09:08:58] <Drager> The DATA
[09:09:01] <Rajni> Drager: $(yourdiv).html();
[09:09:18] <SoulRaven> anyone knows something about tabs and way the content of the tabs is not hidden
[09:09:46] <Rajni> would like to help you but i'm not very experienced :|
[09:11:43] <Drager> Rajni: Thanks
[09:11:46] <docmur> what does find() return?
[09:12:03] <Rajni> Drager no problem ;)
[09:13:13] <Rajni> docmur it returns the elements that match the pattern you wrote
[09:13:48] <docmur> okay but how to do you evaluate that then, so if I do chatDiv.find("newDiv"), would I do if ( find == "newDiv")?
[09:14:00] <docmur> or just if ( find )
[09:14:34] <Rajni> if(chatDiv.find('newDiv').length)
[09:15:17] <docmur> Sweet that worked.
[09:15:25] <Rajni> Great ;)
[09:35:49] <chee> SoulRaven: did you get the new css as well as the new JS?

[09:52:32] <converge> can someone help me?
[09:54:35] <Rajni> converge: instead of html() use val()
[09:55:42] <converge> Rajni: thanks, do you know how to get the select value of the input radio button ?
[09:56:29] <Rajni> alert($('.payment_input_radio _selected_value_').val() should do that
[09:57:04] <Rajni> no wait, need to re-read your code
[09:57:34] <converge> I wrote _selected_value_ just to show what im trying to do
[09:57:51] <fission6> whats an easy way to highlight a search term, in other words add a class to all instances of a work inside a selector
[09:58:36] <Rajni> $('your radio').val()
[09:58:36] <Rajni> in a generic way
[09:58:36] <Rajni> $(#PaymentMethod30Dias).val() as an example
[09:58:36] <Rajni> from your code
[09:59:13] <NoiseEee> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/596351/how-can-i-get-which-radio-is-selected-via-jquery @ converge
[09:59:38] <converge> Rajni, NoiseEee: thanks
[10:00:16] <Rajni> fission6: find and replace logic maybe
[10:00:53] <Rajni> find "term" replace "<span class=highlight>term</span>"

[10:12:05] <firstclassfunc> ronson: OK thanks. I just did that.. is there no other way?
[10:12:49] <Rajni> well you can define the handler outside
[10:12:57] <ronson> firstclassfunc: What other way did you want?
[10:13:00] <Rajni> didn't get why you want another way for doing that
[10:15:03] <firstclassfunc> Rajni, ronson: I was thinking you'd be able to do something like $(whatever).on('click', {input1:'xyz', input2: true}, eventHandler)
[10:15:45] <heyho_> hi all, anyone know iView Slider?  i included a Video, to open it you need to click on the whole slide. is it possible to add an Button for open the video?

[10:18:59] <inad922> Anyone familiar with the internals btw?
[10:20:54] <hateie2> hmm sounds like a job for php/asp tbh
[10:21:18] <hateie2> then return it to a ajax request in json or something perhaps

[11:03:29] <BillCriswell> Drager: $('div').get(0)
[11:03:37] <BillCriswell> or $('div')[0]
[11:03:56] <Drager> BillCriswell: Are you sure?
[11:03:59] <Drager> And how and where
[11:04:59] <BillCriswell> You mean like the non-jquery element from the dom?

[11:05:26] <Otineb> hi guys. I'm having a hell of a time figuring out why this validate() script stops working midway through a form I have limited access to. http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/56fRP/7/ (look for the input field marked "(VALIDATION STOPS WORKING AT THIS LINE)") Any insight would be MUCH appreciated.
[11:08:14] <Otineb> oh, the script removes whitespace from beginning and end of input values.
[11:08:34] <Otineb> You can test by adding spaces, then text and tabbing away. supposed to clip the spaces.
[11:08:58] <Otineb> works as expected on the first 6 input boxes. then stops after the radio button.
[11:09:44] <BillCriswell> Otineb: The console is saying ValidData is not defined as well as EIFGroupClicked is not defined.
[11:12:46] <Otineb> @BillCriswell: hmm. I've been asked to add basic validation to a form that's completely closed off to me. Data gets passed to it before hand. I've tried paring down the jsfiddle form to as close to the final as I could. Let me try removing these offending variables to see if that fixes it.
[11:13:13] <Drager> That didnt work I believe
[11:15:35] <BillCriswell> Weird. Disconnected.
[11:15:59] <BillCriswell> Otineb: Say anything else besides the @BillCriswell thing?
[11:16:21] <Otineb> @billcriswell: lol, i was about to. So glad you're back
[11:16:25] <Otineb> http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/56fRP/11/
[11:16:28] <exit2> Anyone here familiar with FullCalendar?
[11:16:42] <Otineb> i removed the form action and any mention to EIF
[11:17:13] <Otineb> @BillCriswell the form should trim spaces. Works fine until "Additional Info" field
[11:17:27] <Otineb> can't figure out what's in there that stops it dead.
[11:19:34] <BillCriswell> Otineb: Not sure I have enough here to figure it out.
[11:19:46] <BillCriswell> I can't seem to get anything to do anything.
[11:20:32] <therealklanni> Anyone know of a plugin that will put overflowing sub element into a dropdown (think Firefox favorites bar overflow menu) ?
[11:20:57] <Otineb> @BillCriswell: what do you need? Anything I can provide? What you see here is what I'm essentially working with. From my end, I have access to a header file that can add JS. Outside of that this form is closed to me.
[11:21:35] <Otineb> @BillCriswell: The trim is working on any other forms that use <input>'s but this one just stops midway for not apparent reason. I'm very befuddled.
[11:22:01] <devmikey> Why Am I getting the following if I comment out all javascript:
[11:22:01] <devmikey> Error: Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIDOMWindow.content]

[11:24:34] <Otineb> @BillCriswell I know
[11:24:57] <BillCriswell> Otineb: You don't have ID's on the input element below those lines.
[11:25:30] <starlays> can someone help me understand why this: http://jsfiddle.net/gA9ry/5/ is not working?
[11:25:36] <Otineb> @BillCriswell OMGWHY
[11:25:54] <Otineb> @BillCriswell Thanksâ€¦ that does it.
[11:25:59] <Kambfhase> starlays: "not working" is an invalid problem description

[11:26:32] <starlays> Kambfhase: my checkbox is not appearing at all
[11:26:52] <NoiseEee> starlays: invalid html.  you can't have a <table><form>
[11:28:03] <starlays> NoiseEee: hmm
[11:28:10] <starlays> NoiseEee: thank you
[11:28:14] <NoiseEee> np
[11:28:29] <NoiseEee> starlays: its actually in the DOM, but in a nonsensical place so it doesn't display
[11:29:43] <starlays> NoiseEee: i understand, thank you so mutch
[11:30:55] <BillCriswell> Otineb: http://jsfiddle.net/56fRP/12/ might help you out a bit.

[11:49:13] <LloydK> :)
[11:49:18] <LloydK> what code did you use?
[11:49:50] <Drager> var username = $('#post_' + element + '_username')

[12:07:45] <BillCriswell> prevAll() appears to be returning right but the selector is throwing it off.
[12:09:03] <Noeble> question: I started to use the ahah teqnique, works fine to append the html to a div.. however the parent css wont style the page I load.. how can I make that happen without adding the style duplicate times
[12:10:34] <alexlbl> Does anyone know if UI.Sortable supports nested elements? I'm trying to create sortable divs that can be resized and dragged in and out of each other, but it doesn't behave very well... http://jsfiddle.net/z5mzs/
[12:10:35] <Sna4x8> BillCriswell: What I'm trying to do, or that it doesn't work?  Seems like it should work.
[12:10:47] <BillCriswell> Sna4x8: Definitely agreed.
[12:13:41] <therealkoopa> var li = $('<li>').click(function () {  alert('wtf') }
[12:13:41] <therealkoopa> Can you build an element and attach an event handler on it?
[12:13:53] <ale152> hi!
[12:13:54] <therealkoopa> If I then append the li, the click handler doesn't work.
[12:14:02] <therealkoopa> If I go to the console and do a $('li').click(...) then it works
[12:14:07] <ale152> can anyone help me with infinite-scroll and masonry?
[12:15:00] <ale152> I think I have a problem with infinite-scroll callback, because every time I add new post to my page they don't "masonry", but if I resize the page everithing works well!
[12:15:09] <ale152> *posts
[12:15:22] <ale152> the website is: http://www.photocracy.eu/ (try to scroll down the page...)
[12:16:06] <BillCriswell> Sna4x8: $('.node_level_0:not(:last-child)').length works how I'd expect... Not sure why the prevAll() isn't working though
[12:17:16] <Sna4x8> Yea, that works for me, thanks.
[12:17:25] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[12:17:34] <BillCriswell> Would still love to know why what you're doing isn't working.
[12:17:43] <Sna4x8> Think I should report it as a bug?
[12:19:21] <BillCriswell> Sna4x8: Not sure. I like to blame myself till the last possible moment so I wouldn't.
[12:19:32] <BillCriswell> Probably a bad trait in real life.
[12:19:56] <Sna4x8> I generally blame my wife.
[12:20:04] <BillCriswell> Well of course.
[12:20:53] <BillCriswell> I can't focus on work. I hate this.
[12:23:52] <Drager> How should I use parent() to go back three steps?
[12:24:09] <Drager> parent().parent().parent() seems... bad
[12:24:58] <systemfault> You're totally right
[12:25:22] <systemfault> Never use .parent() like that, use .closest('selector here')
[12:26:12] <exit2> can someone help me out with this? http://dpaste.com/816755/ - I'm trying to send post data the same as it comes out in the console.log
[12:27:18] <Drager> systemfault: I have element.parent().parent().parent(), and element is $(this)
[12:37:26] <JoshLambert> Would someone mind reviewing my code and explaining to me why my sortable list is not engaging on my UL/LI tags? I have an example on JSFiddle which is short: http://jsfiddle.net/R8JfA/9/
[12:37:32] <JoshLambert> I would VERY MUCH appreciate it.
[12:37:36] <Dr4g> Why can't i .html() or .appent() a script tag into a <div> ?
[12:37:43] <Dr4g> $('#twitter-container').append('<script charset="utf-8" src="http://widgets.twimg.com/j/2/widget.js"></script>');
[12:37:47] <Dr4g> this does nothing!
[12:37:59] <Dr4g> when i do $('#twitter-container').html(), it's a blank string.
[12:38:48] <StR> Hi everyone!
[12:39:50] <StR> How do I overwrite the default options for JQuery UI datepicker so that all the datepickers have the same path for the buttonImage, for example. I remember there was a way to overwrite the default settings, but I can't find how
[12:40:53] <Kambfhase> ?getScript @ Dr4g
[12:40:53] <bot-t> Dr4g, jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[12:41:19] <Dr4g> I know the function Kambfhase but you have to load it from inside a <div> so that it populates that div.
[12:41:42] <Kambfhase> Why would you want to put a <script> inside a <div>?
[12:42:03] <Dr4g> so the widget loads in the right area
[12:42:14] <Dr4g> .. of the page.
[12:42:26] <Kambfhase> mkay. feels kinda wrong to me
[12:44:02] <Kambfhase> I know, that jQ strips <script> tags, that might just be related to ajax, though
[12:45:32] <Dr4g> Kambfhase: i'm trying to embed the twitter widget onto my page.
[12:46:19] <Dr4g> the existing one was causing a blocking issue on the page as i had the JS directly inside the <div>. so I'm trying to do it upon window(load) or document(ready)
[12:50:30] <JoshLambert> !help
[12:50:58] <StR> found it
[12:55:15] <JoshLambert> Kambfhase: Would you mind taking a look at my broken code? It's less then 10 lines of jQueyr.

[12:56:54] <JoshLambert> Kambfhase: I'm trying to allow users to sort my list
[12:57:07] <Kambfhase> yes, you are doing it wrong
[12:57:08] <JoshLambert> Kambfhase: Then I want to take the new ID list, and do something with it.
[12:57:16] <JoshLambert> Kambfhase: I knew it.. :D
[12:57:20] <JoshLambert> Kambfhase: How do I fix it?
[12:57:28] <Kambfhase> I'll fix it.
[12:57:46] <tomasm-> hi, do ajax responses (updating a small container) have access to the jQuery object? or does it need to re-load the script files?
[12:58:20] <JoshLambert> Kambfhase: Thank you so much!
[12:58:31] <JoshLambert> Kambfhase: I've been fighting with this for hours. :p
[12:58:45] <Kambfhase> stop highlighting me, or I wont do it

[13:03:39] <tomasm-> is it necessary to load another copy of jquery in an ajax response? for some reason sometimes I get 'jQuery is undefined' (if I am not explicit in the ajax file) or I accidentally wipe out custom jQuery.fn functions (if I mention the jquery core)....
[13:04:06] <JoshLambert> I use Firebug all of the time.
[13:04:13] <JoshLambert> Mainly for CSS, but also for basic Javascript.
[13:04:21] <tomasm-> how come an ajax response doesnt have access to the jquery core automagically? I thought it has access to the window's vars, etc
[13:04:50] <tomasm-> OH WAIT, this is file uploads.... meaning it's an iframe
[13:04:56] <Kambfhase> JoshLambert: .serialize() is for forms, afaik
[13:05:12] <JoshLambert> I read somewhere that I was supposed to use that.
[13:05:25] <JoshLambert> Like I said, I've been all over Google trying to soirt this out.

[13:07:48] <JoshLambert> I can't rearrange this list though.
[13:08:01] <JoshLambert> The sortable() method was supposed to do that. I thought anyway...

[13:09:07] <Drager> Kambfhase: ?
[13:09:11] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/R8JfA/15/ @ JoshLambert
[13:09:24] <hlve> beautifyjs.org doesn't exsist, Kambfhase
[13:09:25] <JoshLambert> StR: Your example allows for rearranging, which is correct, but I still have no way to get the new list values to send to my PHP
[13:09:56] <Kambfhase> http://jsbeautifier.org/
[13:09:59] <JoshLambert> NoiseEee: Your example is getting the number in an order like I wanted, but the user can't re-arrange it.
[13:10:19] <JoshLambert> Basically, I need NoiseEee and StR combined.
[13:10:33] <JoshLambert> Rearranging, and getting the new arrangement variable.
[13:11:12] <StR> JoshLambert, checck Kambfhase, he did  what you need to get the new id order
[13:11:18] <Drager> Kambfhase: I didnt mean it like that. I meant functionally
[13:11:21] <NoiseEee> JoshLambert: http://jsfiddle.net/R8JfA/16/ should work,
[13:11:31] <NoiseEee> JoshLambert: providing you actually provide a means of sorting as well ;)
[13:12:38] <Kambfhase> Drager: Well, that code is ok. There is big mistake.
[13:13:11] <Drager> Kambfhase: Well, I had some people whining about it..
[13:13:20] <Kambfhase> huh?
[13:14:05] <Drager> Kambfhase: That's a bad code
[13:14:11] <Drager> Ugly, bad to do so
[13:14:24] <Drager> and so on
[13:15:28] <Kambfhase> Thats just 6 lines of JS. There is nothing much you can do wrong there.
[13:15:52] <Kambfhase> Ok, you declare `element` but just use it once.
[13:15:56] <NoiseEee> Drager: well you can declare you variables, for one.  get_id => var get_id
[13:16:32] <Kambfhase> NoiseEee: m(
[13:16:42] <NoiseEee> also i presume line 3 should read: var element = $(this);    not: var element = $(this),
[13:16:58] <Kambfhase> srsyl?
[13:17:16] <Drager> NoiseEee: Well, I declare alot of vars like that
[13:17:27] <sha1sum> I'm running into an issue with the Android ICS browser (works fine on every other browser on the same phone): I have some JQM collapsible content blocks, and when I open one with a jQPlot chart inside, I can no longer use any of the controls on the entire page. Anybody gone through this or have any clue what this could be about?
[13:17:50] <Kambfhase> NoiseEee: var a,b,c; declarse multiple variables.
[13:17:52] <NoiseEee> Drager: i;m talking about the comma versus semi-colon.  not to mention the uselessness of get_parent_class.
[13:18:13] <NoiseEee> Kambfhase: ahh then part of the complaint is surely illegibility / not apparent / readable
[13:18:13] <Drager> NoiseEee: I know what you were talking about and Kambfhase just gave you the answer
[13:18:19] <NoiseEee> ^^
[13:18:41] <Drager> The complains were about line 6 and 7
[13:18:58] <NoiseEee> well they missed complaning about line 5
[13:19:16] <Drager> What about it?
[13:19:33] <NoiseEee> get rid of get_parent_class and just combine lines 4/5
[13:19:58] <NoiseEee> and personally, i would search parents for a selector (since you're after something specific), not just .parent().parent().parent()
[13:20:01] <NoiseEee> which means nothing
[13:20:14] <NoiseEee> i mean, sure it does stuff, but looking at the code you have no idea how that might relate to any markup or data etc
[13:20:15] <Drager> NoiseEee: Yes, how would I do that
[13:20:27] <Drager> Yeah, that was just temp
[13:20:33] <JoshLambert> This worked: http://jsfiddle.net/R8JfA/17/
[13:20:36] <Kambfhase> closest('.selector')
[13:20:43] <JoshLambert> That is the combination I was looking for...
[13:21:04] <NoiseEee> JoshLambert: great
[13:21:19] <JoshLambert> NoiseEee: Thank you for your help. Are you on Twitter?
[13:23:06] <sha1sum> OK so I just noticed that it has nothing to do with jQPlot... If I put a div with a static height into one of the collapsible content blocks and then expand it, the entire page is "disabled" as far as I can scroll but not touch anything. The blocks without a div with a static height work fine.

[13:25:06] <TelFiRE> if I just hit up the height and width it goes down and right, I also tried animating padding in and out, that was a bust
[13:26:17] <Drager> NoiseEee, Kambfhase, https://pastee.org/g4uuk
[13:26:56] <NoiseEee> Drager: lovely
[13:27:10] <NoiseEee> still, declare get_id, ie: var get_id = <etc>
[13:27:24] <Drager> wow, missed that one
[13:27:25] <Drager> ;)
[13:27:52] <Drager> NoiseEee: Btw, any thoughts why this wont insert that into my textfield?
[13:27:59] <Drager> It does sometimes and sometimes it doesnt.
[13:29:10] <Drager> When press my button it inserts data into the textarea and then I erase the data and presses the button again then it doesnt insert it.
[13:29:13] <Drager> Weird.
[13:30:11] <Kambfhase> textfields are buggers.
[13:30:33] <Kambfhase> try to use .val() or .text()
[13:30:42] <Drager> instead of html?
[13:32:39] <ProLoser|Work> hallo

[13:33:09] <ProLoser|Work> i don't want contributors to commit build files, i was wondering how you guys go about managing this?
[13:33:11] <Drager> Kambfhase: returns nothing
[13:33:15] <ProLoser|Work> perhaps putting the build files elsewhere?
[13:35:01] <UltraMC> Why when clicking here nothing happens? http://jsfiddle.net/Jxk9t/3/
[13:35:44] <NoiseEee> UltraMC: check the console. "Uncaught ReferenceError: el2 is not defined "
[13:35:55] <Kambfhase> UltraMC: el2 is not defined
[13:36:06] <UltraMC> ouf
[13:36:09] <NoiseEee> UltraMC: undoubtedly you want "Â el2Â =Â el.substr(7);"  not "Â el2Â =Â el2.substr(7);"
[13:36:09] <UltraMC> jsfiddle has console?
[13:36:14] <NoiseEee> UltraMC: your own :)
[13:36:21] <UltraMC> dough
[13:36:29] <NoiseEee> UltraMC: but it does if you choose jquery edge, and then check 'firebug lite'
[13:36:31] <UltraMC> defined it, still nothing
[13:36:37] <Drager> Noone has a qlue?
[13:36:46] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/Jxk9t/6/ @ UltraMC
[13:38:00] <UltraMC> NoiseEee, what about clicking it again? it should revert
[13:40:16] <NoiseEee> UltraMC: why?
[13:40:26] <UltraMC> NoiseEee, sec
[13:40:28] <NoiseEee> UltraMC: for one, you never change "ctrl" so it's always 0
[13:40:37] <NoiseEee> UltraMC: second, 'el' is only defined when ctrl==0
[13:40:39] <NoiseEee> lots to go there.
[13:41:11] <UltraMC> Look http://jsfiddle.net/Jxk9t/9/
[13:42:23] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/Jxk9t/11/ @ UltraMC, and re-read my "for second"
[13:42:56] <UltraMC> NoiseEee, hmm... why its unedfined?
[13:43:38] <NoiseEee> ^^
[13:43:50] <NoiseEee> in general the whole thing is rather sloppy :)
[13:44:05] <NoiseEee> but i gotta head back to work, good luck
[13:44:53] <exit2> http://dpaste.com/816775/ this is sending the right id to the console but I want to send it as post, I tried to replace the console.log with $.post() but to no avail
[13:45:01] <UltraMC> NoiseEee, yeah I know... So how to check string to input on click and revert on mouseout? ;-)
[13:47:05] <Drager> Kambfhase: It was the append() line that did it
[13:47:09] <Drager> Using val() instead
[13:47:11] <Drager> Works fine

[14:07:04] <Kambfhase> well, you can make synchronous ajax calls
[14:07:50] <Pnoexz> the thing is i would need the browser to notice post info was sent and act just as if it was done through a form
[14:09:00] <Pnoexz> the problem is that the old post data (the one you use to get to that page) needs to be removed

[14:48:41] <Pnoexz> agunia: no no, what i said would go inside the keyup() function
[14:49:09] <agunia> ohh
[14:49:10] <agunia> ok
[14:49:16] <Pnoexz> besides, ive never used each(), so i dont know the correct syntax
[14:50:59] <agunia> yeah same here
[14:51:17] <agunia> hmm maybe some someone will know this http://jsfiddle.net/QA69d/2/ the updated one
[14:53:10] <BillCriswell> agunia: This is broken.
[14:53:14] <BillCriswell> Are you counting down or up?
[14:53:23] <Pnoexz> down
[14:53:28] <Pnoexz> but up
[14:53:33] <Pnoexz> first up, then down
[14:53:42] <dabear> ?DOWN http://opendesign.bbqdroid.org/
[14:53:44] <bot-t> dabear, It's not just you! - http://404.shtml looks down from here.

[14:54:16] <danmichel> Im getting "Object [object Object] has no method 'imagesLoaded' " http://pastie.org/5100517 http://d.pr/i/DNbE http://theplural.com/ . Thanks in advance for any help
[14:54:21] <agunia> im counting down
[14:54:22] <BillCriswell> debear: There appears to be major outages.
[14:55:29] <agunia> its not that bad to make it work for only one textarea but if you want to have unlimted amount for each one thats where the problem is
[14:55:47] <Pnoexz> danmichel: javascript vars and object dont have to be prepended with $, and you shouldnt if you are doing php and js in the same place (which you shouldnt either)
[14:56:21] <zfly9> hey guys trying to just get this random background image thing working, not sure what I'm doing wrong http://jsfiddle.net/SXtAg/1/
[14:56:30] <Pnoexz> wait wait wait agunia, you keep saying "unlimited amount".. so why the counter?
[14:56:32] <danmichel> thanks Pnoexz. what am i  removing, where?
[14:57:02] <BillCriswell> agunia: http://jsfiddle.net/fjkzt/ hacked this up real quick. Should be able to help.
[14:57:36] <Pnoexz> zfly9: css({'background', images[Math.floor(Math.random() * images.length)] });
[14:57:48] <timwis> Hey guys, I'm using jQueryMobile with jquerymobile-router, and it appears when I transition between pages, I'm getting this random "0" character appended at the end of the content div. Has anyone ever seen something like that?
[14:57:57] <BillCriswell> You'll need to put the handing for when it gets below zero, but that should be enough for now.
[14:58:01] <BillCriswell> Heading home, night guys!
[14:58:02] <Pnoexz> you use + only to concatenate strings, nto JS syntax
[14:58:29] <danmichel> so http://jsfiddle.net/FH7Ls/ Pnoexz?
[14:58:33] <Pnoexz> timwis: something is returning false, which then gets translated to '0'
[14:59:03] <timwis> Pnoexz but I don't even have custom code going
[14:59:10] <agunia> yeah this work PERFECT let me see how its gonna go on my site
[14:59:15] <Pnoexz> danmichel: you are still calling those vars with the $.. $newElems.imagesLoaded(function(){
[14:59:21] <zfly9> Pnoexz didn't work
[14:59:29] <zfly9> where's the semi colon?
[14:59:49] <agunia> pnoexz it is because it all depends how many comments the user writes and for each comment posted there is a div with a text area for the reply
[15:00:09] <Pnoexz> zfly9: you dont need no semi colons
[15:00:10] <agunia> BillCriswell thanks :)
[15:00:29] <danmichel> so http://jsfiddle.net/5NQFk/ Pnoexz
[15:00:30] <Pnoexz> timwis: then im not able to help
[15:00:39] <Pnoexz> im not familiar with that plugin
[15:00:48] <Pnoexz> but what i said is most likely whats going wrong
[15:01:01] <danmichel> I'm still getting the error Pnoexz
[15:01:26] <danmichel> now Object #article-grid has no method 'imagesLoaded'  Pnoexz
[15:01:35] <Pnoexz> danmichel: well, you need to fix your indentation, with the mixture of php and js, i cant read your code at all
[15:01:58] <ProLoser|Work> how do i temporarily unbind all other click events on a dom element and rebind them back later?
[15:02:03] <timwis> pnoexz I just disabled the router plugin, now it's straight jquery mobile and it's still doing it
[15:02:13] <ProLoser|Work> i want to disable all click events on a dom element but be able to re-enable it
[15:02:41] <timwis> ah! I'm using v1.1.0, and I think the jquery version i'm using is too new for that
[15:02:52] <danmichel> Pnoexz: http://pastie.org/5100574
[15:02:57] <Pnoexz> ProLoser|Work: you can have a global variable to handle this, i guess.. not sure how easy it would be to implement
[15:03:07] <timwis> anyone know the latest jQuery version I can use with jQuery Mobile?
[15:03:11] <timwis> anyone know the latest jQuery version I can use with jQuery Mobile v1.1.0 **
[15:03:31] <Pnoexz> danmichel: do you even know anything about javascript?
[15:03:46] <ProLoser|Work> Pnoexz: i don't have access to how the other events were binded
[15:03:48] <danmichel> i dont Pnoexz.
[15:03:52] <ProLoser|Work> i was hoping to forcefully supercede them
[15:04:00] <Pnoexz> danmichel: i cant help you then
[15:04:23] <Pnoexz> ProLoser|Work: ah, i see.. i wouldnt know how to do it
[15:05:39] <timwis> 1.7.1, got it
[15:11:26] <zfly9> Pnoexz didn't work
[15:11:48] <Pnoexz> what a bum
[15:11:58] <Pnoexz> and yes, i didnt work at all today
[15:12:03] <Pnoexz> shameful
[15:12:17] <zfly9> Pnoexz http://jsfiddle.net/SXtAg/2/
[15:14:35] <Pnoexz> fyi, im not going to help until you start being a little bit more descriptive
[15:17:47] <zfly9> what more do you need, it does not give the element a background class..
[15:20:35] <redsand> question on sortable, how can i resize my divs on the same row when dragging them around to always match max width?
[15:20:44] <Zzaichik1> zfly9: http://jsfiddle.net/SXtAg/3/
[15:20:45] <redsand> so 100% but if idrag another on the same row, they're both 50%
[15:25:01] <guy> so.. no one?
[15:25:26] <zfly9> Zzaichiki1 awesome thanks
[15:25:41] <zfly9> I see that it's working in the fiddle, having issues making it work on my site for some reason
[15:33:22] <madprops> im changing the color css property of some links, they change on the spot but when i change the content the links reset to their default state defined in the css ..is there a way to make this permanent without altering the css file?
[15:34:03] <gf3> madprops: JSFiddle go go go
[15:41:46] <firstclassfunc> how can I submit data to a server that isn't in a form? for example, a user clicks a button that corresponds to an index. I want the user to able to submit this index to examplePage. what is the best route?
[15:41:56] <madprops> gf3,  here http://jsfiddle.net/GTe4f/  if you see i have left two lines commented, it works like that, when uncommenting them (emptying the div and loading new data) the css restores to the default
[15:42:47] <gf3> madprops: Oh well that's easy
[15:43:03] <gf3> madprops: You're updating some elements in the document, then replacing them with new elements
[15:43:32] <gf3> madprops: So, of course the new elements don't have the old styles because they weren't around then
[15:44:09] <madprops> gf3, it works for text though
[15:44:37] <agunia> Ok i need to use did for this othewise its affecting all the textareas  how could i do this i tried to add id to the textarea then change the js part to div but wont work this is the working version of this http://jsfiddle.net/L6TJF/
[15:44:49] <gf3> madprops: Hmm?
[15:45:35] <madprops> gf3, i think i know what's going on
[15:45:43] <madprops> gf3, i'll make some changes
[15:45:46] <gf3> madprops: I just told you what's going on
[15:46:04] <gf3> madprops: You're painting your car red, then buying a new black car and wondering why it's not red
[15:46:43] <ben_alman> yeah you should ride a bicycle
[15:46:58] <madprops> gf3, do you think making some hidden divs with those classes will persist the changes? or do I have to set the css everytime i change it?
[15:47:43] <gf3> madprops: Well I'd say you should simply create a new CSS class to re-use
[15:57:17] <zfly9> can anyone tell me why this image randomizer is working in http://jsfiddle.net/SXtAg/3/ but not  http://tolaw.highrankdev.com/about/
[15:57:20] <agunia> would some one look at this please http://jsfiddle.net/L6TJF/
[16:23:22] <Deltaoo> hi >
[16:23:50] <Deltaoo>  need some help to grow a div . I have a div slide out from bottom to half the page height - then want to drag it to the top - can anyone help
[16:24:07] <Deltaoo> I was given this code > http://pastebin.com/YtUAege4 > but the handle is at the bottom and drags down I need it going up
[16:24:25] <Deltaoo> with the handle on the top
[16:27:14] <xSmurf> anyone using DataTables and the Scroller plugin? is it possible to resize the viewport live?!
[16:27:41] <Siver> Hi, I was wondering if there's an easy way to abort javascript execution on page ... for example something I could enter into my console that would stop all my javascript code for the current pageload
[16:27:54] <xSmurf> (or put another way, how do you get the table to 100% x/y of its container using the Scroller plugin of DataTables)
[16:32:36] <KWhat_Work> for jquery menu i should be able to .bind for an event produced by the widget .menu().bind({select: function(){ ... }})  right?
[16:39:20] <coldhead> Siver: you can't really. you can use the debugger; keyword but that's not great for users
[16:39:48] <Siver> coldhead: how do you mean, not great for users? It's just for development testing
[16:40:01] <coldhead> it's not great in that it will open their debugger
[16:40:14] <coldhead> it doesn't abort JS it just suspends it
[16:40:23] <gnarf> debugger; is basically putting a breakpoint on the page
[16:40:28] <coldhead> if it's just for dev that might be what you want!
[16:44:45] <Siver> coldhead: yeah, it does give me somewhat of the result I was looking for ... just kind of inconvenient to browse through elements etc that way as the inspector is also halted so it seems
[16:45:12] <coldhead> it shouldn't be!
[16:45:25] <Deltaoo> anyone with any suggestions?
[16:45:34] <coldhead> i can usually still mouse around the DOM inspector
[16:46:11] <Siver> Weird, I can't for some reason ... using chrome though, might have a go in firefox
[16:46:29] <coldhead> chrome is where it usually works for me
[16:52:01] <black_warlock> guys
[16:52:15] <coldhead> ah black warlock, my old friend
[16:52:22] <black_warlock> how do i call a function every time something change in with jq
[16:52:31] <black_warlock> hey man =)
[16:52:59] <coldhead> black_warlock: with modern browsers you can use this event http://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/02/Detect-DOM-changes-with-Mutation-Observers
[16:53:42] <coldhead> in older browsers you probably want to .trigger('domchange') and bind functions to this custom 'domchange' event
[16:53:53] <coldhead> as in DIY and call that everytime your code changes something
[16:54:21] <black_warlock> hum nice one
[16:54:56] <black_warlock> can you make me an exemple ?
[16:55:07] <black_warlock> function checkit
[16:58:57] <coldhead> black_warlock: http://jsfiddle.net/Vxv74/
[16:59:00] <coldhead> very lame example
[16:59:50] <black_warlock> hahaha
[16:59:55] <black_warlock> lame but easy
[17:00:03] <black_warlock> thats my man
[17:00:05] <black_warlock> :P
[17:01:05] <black_warlock> ty pal
[17:16:41] <BillCriswell> What would be the best way to build the price is right wheel in JavaScript? Should I use canvas or is there a clever way to handle this with a list?
[17:17:10] <coldhead> css3 transforms?
[17:17:31] <coldhead> as overengineered here: http://coldhead.github.com/kaleidos/
[17:18:18] <BillCriswell> All of a sudden wish I had some pot.
[17:18:32] <coldhead> ?cc
[17:18:32] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[17:19:11] <Deltaoo> any idea how I can make this > http://fuzzelogicsolutionslabs.im/__tests/Iwantapullup.html  so that I can drag the black bar and grow the green box.. ? I'm shite with ths stuff  :)
[17:21:05] <BillCriswell> coldhead: I was thinking it would be just like it is on the show. Like a front view of it that spins. Nothing too wild.
[17:22:28] <coldhead> i am sadly out of touch with that show
[17:22:34] <BillCriswell> coldhead: Haha.
[17:22:52] <coldhead> the other thing that comes to mind is this http://html5readiness.com/
[17:23:00] <coldhead> but i guess that's similar to the kaleidoscope too
[17:24:15] <BillCriswell> I basically want to be able to scroll a list infinitely and have it keep repeating the same shit.
[17:24:49] <coldhead> a circle does kind of seem ideal for that
[17:25:11] <coldhead> otherwise you can move elements once they're out of view and append them to the start/end
[17:25:26] <coldhead> but it's slightly trickier if you let me people move backwards AND forwards
[17:26:02] <BillCriswell> coldhead: Hmmm
[17:27:08] <coldhead> BillCriswell: http://jquerytools.org/documentation/scrollable/autoscroll.html ?
[17:27:10] <BillCriswell> The price is right wheel only goes one way so that should work.
[17:27:18] <coldhead> i note that that supports circular: true
[17:27:54] <BillCriswell> coldhead: That should help.
[17:28:44] <coldhead> if i were you i'd just get some pot and zone out with the kaleidoscope instead
[17:28:47] <coldhead> but that's just me
[17:28:55] <coldhead> and all right thinking people who are like me
[17:29:11] <BillCriswell> You know that might be a good idea.
[17:31:19] <madprops> is there a simple way for jquery to return hex value instead of rgb when retrieving css colors?
[17:32:16] <BillCriswell> madprops: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5623838/rgb-to-hex-and-hex-to-rgb
[17:34:27] <madprops> i wonder why this isn't implemented in jquery yet
[17:34:30] <agunia> how can i fix this http://jsfiddle.net/L6TJF/1/ so it works, i need to use id instead of just textarea
[17:39:20] <BillCriswell> agunia: You can't have multiple ids with the same value. You can trigger this functionality by detected the data-max attribute. http://jsfiddle.net/L6TJF/3/
[17:42:59] <agunia> BillCriswell, sorry maybe i mentioned it wrong, does not have to be id's can be also classes anything except the main tags like textarea because its offecting other textareas as well, let me look at this
[17:43:40] <BillCriswell> agunia: You can put do <textarea class="counter"></textarea> and use $('.textarea') to apply it to those.
[17:43:59] <BillCriswell> and use $('.counter')
[17:44:13] <BillCriswell> You can use an id by just doing $('#count-this')
[17:45:39] <agunia> ok bill give me a sec thanks
[17:45:51] <agunia> i will tell you in a little bit how it works :)
[17:45:51] <BillCriswell> welcome
[17:45:54] <BillCriswell> ok
[17:46:16] <BillCriswell> agunia: If you need to select multiple ids you can do $('#foo, #bar') also.
[17:58:50] <agunia> BillCriswell it works fine when i used the class excpet when im scroll down when the forever scroll starts it shows 200 200 so double instead of one, maybe because od the max-data thing ?	
[18:10:47] <agunia> yes it the max-data, is there any way to use something else except that because i cant use it multiple times on other thing because its outputting the number 200 200 twice instead of one
[18:10:58] <agunia> maybe jus separate span for that ?
[19:01:06] <Muimi> About 'dev'

[19:36:20] <aaairc> I'm trying to create a date filter for my website that filters result for events happening "Today." The problem I'm running into is that I'm currently figuring out the current DateTime on the server... but that seems to be producing UTC Dates... so if a user is in PST the filter could end up showing them events happening tomorrow.
[19:36:34] <aaairc> So I was thinking of using JavaScript to get the date from the browser
[19:36:36] <aaairc> with this
[19:36:36] <aaairc> var now = new Date();
[19:36:47] <aaairc> and passing that to the server
[19:56:08] <Jamezor> what's the jquery function that scrolls a scrollable element to the bottom?
[19:56:30] <ryanneufeld> ?scroll @ Jamezor
[19:56:30] <bot-t> Jamezor, .scroll(handler): Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[19:56:38] <Eviltwin> There isn't a function for it, you use a combination of functions
[19:56:56] <Eviltwin> see ?scrollTop and ?height for starters
[19:56:56] <bot-t> .scrollTop(): Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[19:57:23] <ryanneufeld> yeah, that
[19:58:13] <Jamezor> so that function just scrolls to the position that you give it?
[19:58:25] <Jamezor> and default is 0 at the top
[19:58:32] <Jamezor> why wouldn't they make a scrollbottom... lame
[19:59:15] <Jamezor> ?height
[19:59:15] <bot-t> .height(): Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/height/
[19:59:51] <tonylampada> Hi all
[20:05:15] <Jamezor> why doesn't something like this work?     var height = $("#college_public_chat").height()     $("#college_public_chat").scrollTop(height)
[20:06:40] <Jamezor> it doesn't go to the bottom.. it goes to like some distance above the bottom :(
[20:07:32] <Jamezor> I think it's figuring the height of the element while disregarding the overflow
[20:07:44] <Jamezor> how do I include the overflow height?
[20:08:08] <danheberden> Jamezor: you want the scrollHeight
[20:08:13] <gnarf> Jamezor: scrollHeight
[20:08:15] <danheberden> not just the height of the container
[20:08:19] <Jamezor> ohhh
[20:08:23] <Jamezor> ?scrollheight
[20:08:24] <bot-t> Jamezor, .outerHeight() - Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding, border, and optionally margin. http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/
[20:10:31] <Jamezor> like this?     var height = $("#college_public_chat").scrollHeight()?
[20:10:41] <Jamezor> I don't think scrollHeight is a function
[20:10:41] <gnarf> Jamezor: it's a property on the element... so .prop( 'scrollHeight' ) and/or if you have it as "this" already just pull it off of this.scrollHeight
[20:11:08] <gnarf> ?g mdn scrollHeight
[20:11:09] <bot-t> gnarf, element.scrollHeight - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/element.scrollHeight
[20:12:02] <Jamezor> gnarf: sweet thanks :)
[20:14:27] <madprops> will somevar===undefined work with normal javascript?
[20:15:33] <gnarf> ?jsisjs
[20:15:33] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[20:15:55] <gnarf> undefined is in that list
[20:16:03] <gnarf> of things that are JavaScript

[20:54:21] <El_Caballero> Hello guys. I would like to embed a web site insite another web. However, I would like to hide the embed url. Is that possible with jquery?
[20:57:02] <danheberden> yo dawg, i herd you like websites
[20:58:58] <El_Caballero> my problem is that I have done a big part of a website with Vaadin... however, I want to continue with php+jquery without lose my previous work :(
[20:59:48] <madprops> El_Caballero, you mean like modifying the url?
[21:00:59] <El_Caballero> madprops: if I modify the url, people can find it, and use without see all the php website.
[21:01:15] <El_Caballero> use it -> use the vaadin part
[21:03:19] <El_Caballero> madprops: maybe something done with ajax/jquery forces people to see the php+jquery site.
[21:04:25] <madprops> El_Caballero, well i'm not sure if this is what you want but you can change the url with window.history.pushState
[21:04:41] <El_Caballero> madprops: let me see
[21:06:17] <Mariaa> hi i am setting a variable in success callback of $.ajax , but the var doesn't set
[21:15:32] <Cork> Mariaa: your trying to use the variable later in the same function?
[21:16:07] <Mariaa> Cork: yes, i am setting a global var and then using it later
[21:16:18] <Cork> how much later?
[21:16:35] <Mariaa> just after the $.ajax function end
[21:16:48] <Cork> then your reading the variable before its set
[21:16:51] <Mariaa> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13019419/jquery-ajax-setting-a-variable-in-ajax-response/13019749#13019749  is my question, the answer is not what i need to do
[21:17:03] <Cork> the ajax call happens after the parent function ends
[21:17:37] <Mariaa> but i ned to return true or false in parent function based on ajax response, how to do that
[21:17:49] <Cork> you can't return ajax values
[21:17:54] <Cork> its not possible
[21:18:05] <Cork> ajax is async
[21:18:27] <Mariaa> can't i do something like if(msg)=='success' return true
[21:18:30] <danmichel> could anyone tell me why I'm getting ' $container.imagesLoaded is not a function'  http://pastie.org/5101796 on my home server http://theplural.com when I'm not getting it on my  live site http://varmag.com/ ? Only difference is that the JS is combined on the live site
[21:18:41] <Cork> no, cause you don't know if its successfull
[21:19:29] <Mariaa> my php script returns "failed" or "success"
[21:19:32] <Cork> Mariaa: the flow is 1. parent function is called; 2. ajax is called; the rest of parent is executed; 3. the ajax callback (success/failed/completed) is called
[21:19:39] <Mariaa> not returns but echos
[21:19:50] <Mariaa> oh k
[21:20:04] <Cork> Mariaa: what you can do is return the deferred that ajax returns
[21:20:23] <Cork> and use its callbacks to listen for the state
[21:20:24] <Mariaa> so Cork : how do i manipulate the response returned by ajax, in another function?
[21:21:13] <Cork> function parent() { return $.ajax(); };  parent().success(function() {})
[21:22:21] <gnarf> Cork: prefer parent().done()
[21:22:23] <gnarf> instead of success
[21:22:28] <gnarf> the later will dissapear
[21:22:35] <Cork> former :)
[21:22:40] <Cork> but k, thx
[21:35:00] <Mariaa> Cork: that means i need to wrap the ajax call in a function and check its success and then use my global var?
[21:35:28] <Mariaa> but i have to call ajax on submit, how can i wrap it in a function
[21:35:41] <Cork> Mariaa: the global variable can only be uses id you refer to it at a time you know that the ajax call has completed
[21:35:59] <Cork> else you will have race conditions (the net is slow and the variable isn't set)
[21:36:22] <Cork> so the global variable is prob not the best solution
[21:42:24] <Mariaa> Cork: something like this http://pastie.org/5101857
[21:43:31] <Cork> Mariaa: no thats racy
[21:43:51] <Cork> no even worse
[21:44:17] <Cork> Mariaa: checkdate isn't a variable
[21:44:26] <Cork> it returns the variable you need
[21:44:58] <Cork> and you don't need to set a global variable the callback will give you the data
[21:45:20] <Cork> (and like gnarf said, use .done not .success)
[21:49:09] <Mariaa> hmm
[21:49:38] <Mariaa> i thought checkdate.done or .success will be called when checkdate is complete
[21:52:34] <Cork> no its called when the stack is run
[21:52:52] <Cork> so in your case its when the event handler has ended
[21:53:02] <Cork> but doesn't matter if you add another function around it
[21:53:18] <Cork> it will just make the stack deeper, and delay the callback
[21:53:50] <Cork> Mariaa: success can't ever be called until the chain of js functions you've made has all been exited
[21:54:38] <Cork> Mariaa: js can never run two process at the same time, so the callback has to wait until your sync calls have exited for it to be allowed to run
[21:54:56] <Cork> (i'm simplifying this a little, bot for this case its true)
[21:55:01] <Cork> *but
[21:56:15] <Mariaa> so success cannot be called untill the .submit ends?
[21:57:41] <Cork> yes
[21:58:13] <Cork> Mariaa: plainly sync can't wait for async
[21:58:26] <Cork> it has to go async if it want to wait for it
[21:59:54] <Cork> and that also means the submit event will have to let the submit cancel or go through before the ajax response happen
[22:01:32] <Mariaa> then that doesn't help me in anyway
[22:01:49] <Mariaa> i mean i need the submit to work based on what ajax returns
[22:02:14] <Cork> if you want the ajax call to decide the normal form submission, you have only one option
[22:02:56] <Cork> when you get the submit callback cancel the submit (event.preventDefault()), and when the ajax call comes back trigger it again if it succeeds
[22:04:17] <Cork> but yes, combining normal form submission and ajax calls is prob not the best solution
[22:04:35] <Cork> either go full ajax, or let the server handle the validation
[22:04:51] <Cork> (after the normal form submission)
[22:05:23] <randomdev> Can anyone show me an example of how to use jquery autocomplete on multiple select lists?
[22:06:00] <Cork> just make a selector that matches all the elements
[22:11:32] <cryptopsy> can jquery wrap images around images?
[22:11:44] <danheberden> wat
[22:11:47] <Cork> wrap wround??
[22:11:51] <Cork> *around
[22:12:06] <randomdev> http://jsfiddle.net/ML8rP/1/ is what i am trying to do :/
[22:12:14] <Mariaa> http://pastie.org/5101857 Cork ?
[22:12:27] <cryptopsy> danheberden: yea, like a motherfucking grid
[22:12:36] <cryptopsy> with one big ass image in the center
[22:12:40] <cryptopsy> wrap the little images around it
[22:13:05] <Cork> Mariaa: that will call alert before the submit happens
[22:13:20] <Cork> Mariaa: your calling it when the code is parsing
[22:13:50] <cryptopsy> i wanna make a 200x200px image of my big nigger dick with white women that i data-mine from dating sites in 100x100px images, wrap around the larger image
[22:14:23] <cryptopsy> like the brady-bunch, you know how the kids are in the squares
[22:14:38] <cryptopsy> http://handsomeinpink.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/brady-bunch.jpg-6880.jpg
[22:14:47] <cryptopsy> that's not a porn site btw
[22:15:11] <cryptopsy> image the perimiter images are a linear list like a.jpg b.jpg ... g.jpg
[22:15:17] <Cork> cryptopsy: you could try using css border-image
[22:15:36] <Cork> other then that no you can't wrap img tags around another img tag
[22:16:24] <cryptopsy> Cork: maybe jquery have an easy way to do it
[22:16:33] <cryptopsy> so when the user resize window , the wrapping is larger
[22:16:36] <Cork> it doesn't
[22:16:42] <cryptopsy> fuck
[22:16:48] <Cork> cause there really isn't an easy way to do it
[22:16:54] <cryptopsy> this is a really big problem, you realise?
[22:16:57] <Cork> but like i said, check out css border-image
[22:17:01] <Cork> not really
[22:17:05] <cryptopsy> yes, really
[22:17:08] <Cork> ?g mdn border-image
[22:17:09] <bot-t> Cork, border-image - CSS | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/border-image
[22:17:12] <cryptopsy> image the user resize window, then it should display more images
[22:17:18] <cryptopsy> now i gotta compute ratios and shit
[22:17:20] <Cork> uh...
[22:17:21] <cryptopsy> imagine*
[22:17:32] <Cork> then you will have to write the code for that
[22:17:47] <cryptopsy> mathematica can problem wrap multi-dimensional objects around the surfaces of other high dimensional objects
[22:18:26] <HyShai> hello
[22:18:34] <cryptopsy> HyShai: hi
[22:18:46] <cryptopsy> Cork: i don't get it, could you please explain it for me?
[22:19:04] <randomdev> http://jsfiddle.net/ML8rP/1/ can anyone tell me how to apply multiple combobox to seperate select lists ?
[22:19:10] <HyShai> Can I ask a quick question re:jqueryui autocomplete plugin?
[22:19:11] <cryptopsy> Cork: yea i think i get it, but you don't get what im saying
[22:19:25] <cryptopsy> Cork: imageine the user resize to a larger size, now theres gotta be 3 images on the sides of the central image
[22:19:28] <cryptopsy> automatically
[22:19:41] <cryptopsy> now image your website lists from top to bottom streams by popularity (like cam whores, or whatever)
[22:19:49] <cryptopsy> now you gotta compute geometry in js
[22:20:26] <cryptopsy> you can't just expand horizontal vectors, since the popularity score for each image doesn't line that way
[22:21:03] <HyShai> I'm returning html as the 'source' for autocomplete, but it's being rendered as text....
[22:21:12] <HyShai> how can I get it to render as HTML?
[22:24:01] <Cork> cryptopsy: you could always render it in canvas and do what ever you like
[22:24:27] <HyShai> I know there is a ._renderItem function, but it's a private method with almost no documentation....
[22:26:21] <cryptopsy> Cork: mabye, but not without your help, because im fucking retarde
[22:26:28] <cryptopsy> well, im a mathematician
[22:27:01] <HyShai> So basically does anyone know how to use custom html for the autocomplete plugin?
[22:28:07] <cryptopsy> Cork: what's canvas?
[22:28:08] <cryptopsy> how2?
[22:31:02] <cryptopsy> jquery provide some function to draw on canvas easier?
[22:31:29] <cryptopsy> there's a jcanvas
[22:31:47] <cryptopsy> jquery should merge into html5
[22:31:51] <cryptopsy> can't do shit without it
[22:33:00] <Cork> ?g mdn canvas @ cryptopsy

[22:35:24] <munderwo-work> HI all. Im using the datatables javascript library, and on a rerender of the table, I get an error 'Cannot read property '_iDisplayStart' of null', has anybody hit this before or know how to get around it?
[22:36:24] <Cork> munderwo-work: just check the source code from where its used
[22:42:08] <cryptopsy> jcanvas is well supported?
[22:42:13] <cryptopsy> do they have their own channel?
[22:45:37] <HyShai> exit
[22:59:26] <cryptopsy> jcanvas help here?
[22:59:53] <cryptopsy> i've never seen a tag-cloud with images before
[23:03:09] <HyShai4> Hi
[23:28:48] <notafrog> What's the correct way to get the position of element's bottom (from the top of the document)? I'm using $article.offset().top + $article.outerHeight(), but it's giving me a value smaller than the article's height alone (when inspected with chrome dev tools)
[23:35:21] <anli> What should this be in a .animate complete event handler?
[23:35:32] <anli> I call a function from that handler, should this be preserved?
[23:35:48] <anli> Or will it get another value?
[23:37:52] <Dr4g> I have an object with numerical keys, what's the best function to use to delete object items by key, splice? delete?
[23:39:27] <cgcardona> out of curiosity do you want the keys that remain to reformat into correct numerical order?
[23:39:43] <Dr4g> well, yes and no. No because the key is a RegionID
[23:39:52] <Dr4g> but yes, bcoz i want to be able to recognise the 'first item'
[23:40:23] <Dr4g> I don't mind iterating the array and running a 'break' on the first item to get the first item's key and pop it off.
[23:40:24] <cgcardona> but I guess you could recognize the 'first item' by just checking the lowest valued key
[23:40:32] <cgcardona> sure
[23:40:41] <Dr4g> cgcardona: regionID's can be random, they're not sorted.
[23:40:48] <Dr4g> it could be, 13, 6, 94
[23:40:51] <cgcardona> ah gotcha
[23:41:30] <Dr4g> so iterate the object by key/val, and delete the first item and break out of the loop.
[23:42:59] <Dr4g> does that sound sensible
[23:44:08] <Dr4g> cgcardona: i'm back, i disconnected.
[23:44:25] <Dr4g> Dr4g: so iterate the object by key/val, and delete the first item and break out of the loop. - does that sound sensible?
[23:45:35] <cgcardona> sure
[23:45:44] <Dr4g> cgcardona: or, can i get a list of the keys?
[23:45:49] <Dr4g> and then get keys[0]
[23:46:04] <cgcardona> yea you can get keys. Object.keys
[23:46:17] <Dr4g> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys
[23:46:22] <cgcardona> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys
[23:46:24] <cgcardona> heh
[23:46:25] <Dr4g> ;)
[23:46:33] <Dr4g> i'm concerned about "Introduced in JavaScript 1.8.5"
[23:46:42] <cgcardona> yeah I 've been using that a lot lately so then I can loop over it with .forEach()
[23:46:44] <Dr4g> i'm not familiar with the versioning of things.
[23:46:51] <cgcardona> what browser do you support?
[23:46:57] <Dr4g> as much as I can
[23:47:03] <Dr4g> i don't wanna leave out IE7 or IE8
[23:47:13] <Dr4g> definitely not IE8 anyway
[23:47:18] <Dr4g> what versions are they on ?
[23:47:30] <cgcardona> ok in that case you might not want to use it. see if there is a jquery equivalent
[23:47:39] <cgcardona> not sure what versions but prob not 1.8.5
[23:49:10] <Dr4g> just $.map() or $.each() really
[23:49:18] <Dr4g> which is the same as 'for i in object'
[23:49:20] <cgcardona> yeah each should work
[23:49:31] <cgcardona> just create an array outside and .push the keys into it.
[23:55:07] <Cork> cgcardona, Dr4g or use $.map($(). function() { return });
[23:55:16] <Dr4g> I'm using map
[23:57:56] <Dr4g> This isn't working: delete geoJsonMap[keys[0]];
[23:58:04] <Dr4g> keys[0],  works fine, it gives me the first key
[23:58:26] <Dr4g> say keys[0] is 19, so delete geoJsonMap[19], doesn't wrok
[23:58:29] <Dr4g> work*
[23:59:04] <Dr4g> oh, wait it does work. i'm just not removing the polygons from the map
[23:59:04] <Dr4g> hehe
[23:59:15] <Cork> :)
