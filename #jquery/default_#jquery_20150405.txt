[01:28:51] <droid909> var data = $('#myform').serrializeArray();  how do i add another value to data?
[01:29:05] <droid909> data['another']=value; ?
[01:30:26] <droid909> and the answer is ... data.push({name: 'username', value: 'this is username'});
[01:30:44] <arthurvr> droid909: yup
[01:55:43] <sadtaco> I'm trying to match the least shallow group of elements that match a selector.

[02:01:09] <hefest> jquery.jpanelmenu is working only on reload of the page, if i come to page href from another page on the same site, it's not responding. any ideas?
[02:15:54] <sadtaco> eh how can I get how deep/shallow an element is nested relative to another
[02:21:37] <sadtaco> ah parentsUntil().length
[02:41:16] <motaka2> how can I have special settings for a plugin?
[02:42:24] <sadtaco> ?
[02:43:39] <motaka2> $("#guide").testPlugin({a:b})
[02:43:56] <motaka2> $("#driver").testPlugin({c:d})
[02:44:09] <motaka2> when I do this
[02:44:30] <motaka2> I just have c:d in testPlugin
[02:45:02] <motaka2> I need special setting for each this.selector
[03:07:51] <droid909> guys, i want to add html right before  an element with a certain id
[03:07:57] <droid909> how can i do that?
[03:11:05] <droid909> nevermind

[03:27:02] <motaka2> droid909: I think using data is the only way

[04:00:08] <sadtaco> ... well I can't find a working jquer ui sortable plugin that makes nested lists work.  Experimented with a lot of junk that sucks.
[04:01:08] <adv_> anyone knows of a plugin to achieve speakerdeck.com-like thumbnails UI?
[04:03:39] <sadtaco> http://a.shinynew.me/post/4641524290/jquery-ui-nested-sortables this works but it's a pull req not plugin
[06:04:56] <sadtaco> Does anyone have a good solution for getting nested jquery ui sortables to work? I basically have a tree I need to be able to freely move items through
[06:14:17] <sadtaco> http://jsfiddle.net/AbUPM/513/ wait.. I guess I'm doing something wrong if this works :|
[08:11:52] <sadtaco> Erg.  How do I make different behavior for different items in a ui sortable list?  I have two different items in the list that need different connectWith. So basically I need two different .sortable() bound but only one can be.
[08:12:23] <sadtaco> I guess I can use the events to hard code it
[08:30:38] <ohcibi> i'm trying to destroy a selectboxit widget. according to the api, there is a destroy method, destroy however, is undefined... am I missing something? http://jsbin.com/tuhisibegi/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:59:54] <cgeo> happy easter ! can someone recommend a good js or jquery book for medium to advanced concepts
[10:00:05] <arthurvr> cgeo: learn.jquery.com lol
[10:00:10] <arthurvr> cgeo: and happy easter!
[10:00:53] <cgeo> i do find the docs excellent
[10:01:11] <cgeo> but looking for some lower level understanding of things
[10:01:16] <arthurvr> learn.jquery.com is something a little different from the all day docs.
[10:01:23] <Rainb> How do you make strings with same values but separated by whitespaces match?
[10:01:36] <Rainb> for example "value something" equals "something value"
[10:01:53] <arthurvr> Rainb: let me show you a jsbin in 5 minutes
[10:02:22] <arthurvr> cgeo: learn.jquery.com has an order and stars from various levels of knowledge, docs like the api documentation don’t .
[10:02:46] <sash_> Rainb: Manually, I'd say.
[10:03:04] <arthurvr> nah
[10:03:09] <sash_> Nah?
[10:03:16] <arthurvr> 5 minutes and I’ll show
[10:03:37] <sash_> k
[10:05:12] <cgeo> thanks arthurvr i guess ill master these resources before going too deep into naitive JS
[10:06:05] <arthurvr> Rainb: not sure I got your question right, but is this what you want to do? http://jsbin.com/jupabugeci/1/edit?js,console,output
[10:08:02] <Rainb> arthurvr: ohh noo, lol, sorry, I really didn't specify.. I want to compare strings based on their values, but without caring for their order, so for example "1 2 3" comparing to "2 1 3" or "3 1 2" would equal the same.
[10:08:03] <Rainb> Actually
[10:08:12] <Rainb> I was thinking remove dups, then sort, then compare.
[10:08:20] <arthurvr> Oh that’s not difficult as well.
[10:08:28] <arthurvr> give me another 10 minutes I’m busy right now
[10:08:35] <arthurvr> but I’ll show you something
[10:11:54] <decx> are they always full numbers with spaces?
[10:12:31] <Rainb> no they're words
[10:12:47] <Rainb> "chair table hand"
[10:12:59] <decx> so "dog cat mouse" == "cat mouse dog"
[10:13:05] <Rainb> hmm ya
[10:13:15] <sash_> Rainb: I would do it like this, no jquery though http://jsfiddle.net/ja2q0jrc/
[10:13:51] <decx> yeah that looks like what i'd do to
[10:14:12] <decx> but yeah, jquery doesnt have anything to do with this kind of problem anyway :>
[10:14:25] <arthurvr> it has one thing handy for that.
[10:14:28] <arthurvr> jQuery.unique
[10:14:34] <arthurvr> to filter the duplicates.
[10:14:48] <decx> is that used in extend?
[10:15:01] <arthurvr> `api jQuery.unique
[10:15:01] <b-ot> arthurvr: jQuery.unique(): Sorts an array of DOM elements, in place, with the duplicates removed. Note that this only works on arrays of DOM elements, not strings or numbers. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.unique/
[10:15:09] <arthurvr> decx: yes I think so. Why?
[10:15:25] <decx> i've never heard of unique but that seems like where it would be used ^^
[10:15:38] <arthurvr> it does work on strings but is undocumented
[10:15:45] <arthurvr> so nah, try to use something else.
[10:16:10] <decx> well keep those undocumented gems coming, i dig it
[10:16:27] <arthurvr> better to not use undocumented stuff, bro.
[10:16:39] <decx> but i can dig it :(
[10:16:45] <arthurvr> yes you can
[10:17:40] <arthurvr> anyways you’ve got your answer right?
[10:17:51] <decx> that fiddle should've done it
[10:18:01] <sash_> Still no need for jquery: http://jsfiddle.net/ja2q0jrc/1/
[10:18:38] <sash_> With help from stackoverflow, I admit ;)
[10:19:02] <sash_> http://stackoverflow.com/a/14438954
[10:19:59] <arthurvr> nope there isn’t. That’s not what’s jquery is meant for huh
[10:20:33] <sash_> Of course not.
[10:21:03] <arthurvr> decx: jquery.unique is freakin’ handy by the way
[10:21:05] <decx> well i've seen someone do a 2d platformer with only css(), people will find a way to use jquery no matter how preposterous ;)
[10:21:23] <sash_> People use too much js in general :(
[10:22:04] <arthurvr> ya

[17:17:44] <sadtaco> http://jsfiddle.net/3fowqe59/1/ I'm having a hell of a time figuring out how I can make it so ".me" can be moved freely through the nested ols but only ".not-me" can be on shallowest level, ol.lines
[17:47:10] <sadtaco> http://jsfiddle.net/3fowqe59/1/ I'm having a hell of a time figuring out how I can make it so ".me" can be moved freely through the nested ols but only ".not-me" can be on shallowest level, ol.lines
[18:09:34] <aolko> hey there
[18:11:24] <aolko> how do i make ste-by-step wizard (form) w/ jquery + semantic ui (+formvalidation)?
[18:16:49] <mdev> google jquery wizard
[18:16:50] <sadtaco> That's a really in depth question. Look for a tutorial.
[18:16:54] <mdev> number of examples out there
[18:17:47] <sadtaco> http://jsfiddle.net/3fowqe59/2/ I'm having a hell of a time figuring out how I can make it so ".me" can be moved freely through the nested ols but only ".not-me" can be on shallowest level, ol.lines.  I don't want ".not-me" able to be placed in the deeper nests.
[18:18:06] <aolko> well, there's no specific tutorials for SUI
[18:18:27] <aolko> and formvalidation
[18:19:47] <sadtaco> There are certainly tons of tutorials for form validation...
[18:19:48] <sadtaco> and plugins..
[18:20:24] <aolko> well, i tried jquery steps and it didn't work out well
[18:21:38] <sadtaco> Well I don't think someone is just going to do it for you.  Your question is a complicated multi part answer. You're asking about a whole system and not a specific issue.
[18:22:44] <sadtaco> Wowwww I'm a retard. I was using .hasClass('.class'). I always do that
[22:25:57] <brcweggs> does anyone know if there's some kind of security issue or something that prevents jQuery/javascript from editing the value of a form input that's hidden via CSS?
[22:27:15] <mdev> nah just you doing it wrong
[22:27:23] <mdev> wrong id or something :)
[22:27:35] <mdev> jquery has complete access to the DOM afaik
[22:33:56] <brcweggs> Gracias :)
[23:48:10] <brcweggs> If you change the value of an input with jQuery, then grab that form's HTML via the .html() function, shouldn't the HTML it retrieves reflect the changed input value? It looks like .html() returns the HTML *before* the changes were made: http://jsfiddle.net/3oenskbm/1/
[23:50:43] <arthurvr> brcweggs: That’s totally right.
[23:50:55] <arthurvr> brcweggs: Look at your devtools, it does not change there as well.
[23:54:30] <brcweggs> arthurvr, totally, what would you think is the correct way to retrieve the updated html here? clone()?
