[00:00:00] <Cork> though i would argue that is a bit risky
[00:00:36] <Cork> xqo: in a function call <object>.<function> <object> becomes "this"
[00:00:48] <Cork> there isn't any additional pointers
[00:01:19] <Cork> so ws.onopen => Test.prototype.onopen.call(ws)
[00:03:27] <xqo> ok
[00:03:43] <xqo> so how can i get around this?
[00:03:51] <xqo> besides .bind
[00:04:07] <Cork> you could try something like this.ws.ref = this;
[00:04:16] <Cork> and in the onopen do this.ref
[00:04:39] <xqo> oh yes thats clever. thank you!
[00:04:56] <Cork> you could even do something like
[00:05:03] <Cork> var self = this.ref || this;
[00:06:49] <xqo> i like the first solution. thank you!
[00:07:04] <Cork> xqo: the last line is an extension on the first one
[00:07:18] <Cork> it lets you use onopen on the Test object too
[00:07:24] <xqo> i dont really understand it
[00:07:32] <Cork> though as you write this for websocket, you prob don't need it
[00:07:50] <Cork> xqo: btw why are you having the function on the Test object at all?
[00:08:04] <Cork> doesn't look like you have any need for it there
[00:08:18] <vinex08> yehhheyy!! successfully used .hover instead of mouseenter and leave http://jsfiddle.net/uFB6Y/3/ :)
[00:09:07] <xqo> Cork for neatness i suppose
[00:09:28] <Cork> xqo: it isn't really neat as you have to transfer the object
[00:09:39] <Cork> xqo: if you have it inline in the constructor
[00:09:44] <Cork> and have var self = this; outside
[00:09:54] <Cork> and have it call self.onopen(event);
[00:10:02] <Cork> you wouldn't have to do any magic at all
[00:10:34] <Cork> var self = this; this.ws.onopen = function(event) { self.onopen(event); }
[00:11:15] <xqo> ok, maybe. ill think about it
[00:11:44] <vinex08> you guys are talking about jQuery codes right?
[00:12:03] <xqo> its generic javascript really
[00:12:07] <Cork> yes
[00:12:32] <Cork> it's basic object handling in js
[00:12:51] <vinex08> oic
[00:13:44] <interop_madness> i noticed some jquery plugins being accessible with $(selector).data("pluginName").function(param) instead of $(selector).pluginName("function", param); i find the first style much better. my plugins are using the latter. how can i change that?
[00:14:22] <Cork> interop_madness: i don't see how the first one is better
[00:14:47] <Cork> the difference is basically that it doesn't wrap the inner structure behind a front end
[00:15:05] <Cork> and just exposes the raw inner structure to the world
[00:15:22] <interop_madness> Cork, i can enter $(selector).data("pluginName") in the JS console and inspect the state
[00:15:42] <Cork> interop_madness: you can often do this with .pluginName too
[00:15:57] <Cork> it only depends if it uses .data() for storing the individual data
[00:16:19] <interop_madness> $(selector).pluginName?
[00:16:22] <Cork> yes
[00:16:33] <Cork> like i said it has nothing to do with the front end
[00:16:42] <Cork> it only depends on how they store there data
[00:16:51] <interop_madness> returns function() in the console
[00:16:51] <Cork> jquery ui does this for example
[00:16:56] <Cork> uh...
[00:17:01] <interop_madness> the other plugins return object
[00:17:03] <sx_> help!! guys, how to find the different value between two arrays
[00:17:06] <Cork> no i meant $(selector).pluginName often uses .data() too
[00:17:19] <Cork> only difference is that it has an api
[00:17:44] <interop_madness> what i want is to be able to inspect a jquery plugin's state with the console#
[00:18:08] <Cork> interop_madness: and that has nothing to do with if you have $().pluginName or not
[00:18:19] <Cork> it only matters how you store your data
[00:18:21] <sx_> ok, i will check the api carefully..
[00:18:43] <Cork> sx_: jquery doesn't really provide a direct function for that
[00:18:51] <interop_madness> so how can i store that data such that i get the second way of i mentioned? is there a code example?
[00:18:54] <Cork> sx_: you want a list of the differencing values or something?
[00:19:26] <Cork> interop_madness: this.data('the-key-i-want-to-expose-data-on', data)
[00:19:34] <Cork> where this is the normal this in the plugin
[00:20:03] <interop_madness> and this is usually done for all functions or properties that need to be exposed, individually?
[00:20:05] <Cork> interop_madness: it is usually how plugins store element unique data
[00:20:31] <Cork> interop_madness: no it is usually done for the data that needs to be stored individually for each element
[00:20:40] <Cork> why duplicate the functions for each element
[00:21:06] <interop_madness> i dont quite follow you
[00:21:42] <Cork> interop_madness: if you add functions to $(elm).data() you will create a copy of that function to each element you ever initialize the plugin on
[00:21:53] <Cork> interop_madness: that is a gigantic waist of memory
[00:22:10] <Cork> as the function normally do the same thing what ever object it runs on
[00:22:27] <Cork> interop_madness: what you want to do is store the data that belongs to that element on the .data for that element
[00:25:12] <xqo> i keep getting this in my console when i use jquery
[00:25:13] <xqo> "event.returnValue is deprecated. Please use the standard event.preventDefault() instead. "
[00:25:23] <xqo> jquery-min.js:3
[00:25:42] <xqo> the jquery version is jquery-2.0.3.min.js
[00:26:31] <interop_madness> Cork, that is not what i initially asked though, is it?
[00:26:58] <Cork> interop_madness: no, but i explained why you don't want to add functions to .data
[00:27:19] <Cork> and i really don't see why you need duplicate functions in .data for you to be able to track state
[00:27:30] <interop_madness> so kendo UI does it wrong and wastes memory? is that what you are saying?
[00:27:43] <Cork> if they add functions do .data; yes
[00:27:52] <interop_madness> yeeeeah...
[00:30:51] <sx_> @Cork, in fact..i wanna the union..make a fool..lol
[00:31:16] <Cork> sx_: so you just want to merge them?
[00:31:21] <Cork> witch side should win?
[00:31:43] <xqo> are you guys not getting this when you load jquery?  "event.returnValue is deprecated. Please use the standard event.preventDefault() instead. "
[00:31:51] <sx_> like between [1,2,3],[2,3,4], i wanna [2,3]
[00:32:04] <Cork> ok
[00:33:07] <sx_> @Cork i think there shoue be an api to get result directly, look like i should write the cold by myself
[00:33:23] <Cork> sx_: $.grep(arr1, function(val) { return $.inArray(val, arr2) !== -1; });
[00:33:57] <Cork> though it would return duplicate values if it exist multiple times
[00:34:17] <Cork> [1,2,3,2],[2,3,4] => [2,3,2]
[00:34:42] <Cork> but only in one direction though [1,2,3,2],[2,3,4,2] => [2,3]
[00:34:46] <Cork> opps
[00:34:49] <sx_> ohhh,
[00:34:52] <Cork> * [1,2,3],[2,3,4,2] => [2,3]
[00:36:05] <sx_> i will try it ..in my case, there no duplicate values in array, so it should works, thanks
[00:48:18] <xqo> which jquery version is recommended? 1.x or 2.x?
[00:48:54] <xqo> and is 1 or 2 the most recent? because 2.0.3 keeps giving me a warning about "event.returnValue is deprecated."
[00:54:19] <Cork> xqo: 1.x
[00:54:30] <xqo> oh
[00:54:38] <Cork> xqo: 2.x is for ppl that don't care about ie < 9
[00:54:53] <xqo> in that case, what is the downside to using 1.x instead?
[00:54:57] <Cork> though that said, i don't see that warning
[00:55:08] <Cork> xqo: slightly bigger jquery.js lib
[00:55:16] <xqo> thats it?
[00:55:16] <Cork> as it has the workarounds for older ie's
[00:55:19] <Cork> ya
[00:55:24] <xqo> alright cool. thanks!
[00:55:41] <Cork> 2.0 and 1.9/1.10 is api compatible
[00:56:42] <xqo> ugh
[00:56:50] <xqo> i changed to 1.10 now, and i still get the warning
[00:57:01] <Cork> xqo: though that said, the warning can be ignored
[00:57:09] <Cork> jquery reference it for compatibility
[00:57:12] <Cork> it doesn't depend on it
[00:57:27] <xqo> i think its a little annoying to have to clear the console so often because the warning fills it more rapidly
[00:57:53] <Cork> you should only ever get one...
[00:58:04] <Cork> unless you load multiple jquery libs
[00:58:23] <xqo> "Preserve log upon navigation"
[00:58:30] <Cork> ah
[00:58:42] <Cork> well you could either check for a pref in chrome to hide it
[00:58:55] <Cork> or monkey patch jquery not to support it
[00:59:13] <xqo> i suppose ill just live with it. thank you
[01:00:54] <Cork> hmm
[01:01:01] <Cork> xqo: or you could jump to jquery 1.11
[01:01:10] <Cork> it has removed the legacy check
[01:01:44] <Cork> xqo: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0-beta3.js
[01:01:50] <xqo> thank you!
[01:02:00] <Cork> though note it is beta not stable
[01:02:12] <xqo> what are map files, and do i need one?
[01:02:39] <Cork> map files is how chrome and firefox revert minifications
[01:02:53] <Cork> so you can still see the full source in the console
[01:03:24] <xqo> ok, but they are not necessary? so i can use 1.11 without one, i mean (unless one exists)
[01:03:59] <Cork> the file i gave you shouldn't even request one
[01:04:05] <Cork> as it isn't minified
[01:04:08] <xqo> oh okay. thank you
[01:42:17] <hemangpatel> How to add placeholder in IE ?
[01:43:00] <DarsVaeda> what is the standard timeout on .getscript?
[01:47:05] <svetlana> https://github.com/Gryllida/Afch2/blob/master/script.js - I started from scratch, please look for XXX on the page and suggest something, I'm trying to just get DOM sorted (it means 3 ajax calls of which 2nd and 3rd should wait for the 1st one to complete) (re-sent from #wikimedia-tech which appears to be sleepy)
[01:47:57] <interop_madness> i'm trying to expose plugin functionality via jquery.data, instead of dispatching function via $(selector).pluginName("functionName", args). see:  http://jsfiddle.net/bCBh4/5/   any ideas how to improve this architecturally?
[01:52:03] <shoky> svetlana: in function DOM()  you can put the result of the query(0).then(...) calls into an object property e.g.  this.ready = this.page.query(0).then(....);
[01:54:13] <shoky> svetlana: then when you use it..  var dom = new DOM(); dom.ready.done( dom.setUp, dom.fillIn )   or similar. might need to use $.proxy or .bind to get "this" right inside
[01:54:25] <shoky> just an example.
[01:55:56] <tomsa_> Hi, is there a way to remove a <span> added around highlighted text without loosing selection? I tried unwrap(), it works welll but It removes the selection as well :/
[02:02:03] <Cork> tomsa_: no, cause removing an element involves modifying the dom (obviously)
[02:02:16] <Cork> tomsa_: so when the browser does that the selection gets reset
[02:02:30] <Cork> tomsa_: you could store the selection and then re generate it though
[02:02:35] <svetlana> shoky, thank you.
[02:03:25] <tomsa_> Cork thanks for the explanation and the idea :)
[02:12:41] <morfin> how can i return results from async ajax?
[02:12:50] <Cork> you can't
[02:13:04] <Cork> async can only work with callbacks
[02:13:42] <morfin> but how plugins use it to load data as example if i pass url where from it downloads data and it do async ajax then fills select\tree\something
[02:13:56] <Cork> morfin: callbacks
[02:14:23] <Cork> jquery ui autocomplete is a good example
[02:35:45] <walidvb> hey guys, can anyone explain why the result of the embedded jsfiddle are not showing at the bottom of this page: http://walidvb.com/nomades/index.html ?
[02:35:51] <walidvb> the markup is there, but it doesn't show.. weird..
[02:37:54] <Cork> walidvb: something sets height: 0px; on the inner iframe
[02:38:51] <walidvb> Cork: argh, missed that.
[02:38:55] <walidvb> i'll google that
[02:40:15] <Cork> walidvb: #result doesn't have a height
[02:40:25] <Cork> so every thing from there and down collapses
[02:41:27] <Cork> walidvb: oh, wait
[02:41:32] <Cork> no the html isn't there
[02:41:38] <Cork> <pre data-language="html" class="html tCont rainbow active"></pre> <--
[02:41:45] <walidvb> Cork: it seems that the fact that the embed starts as hidden, breaks it
[02:41:57] <Cork> same for <pre data-language="css" class="css tCont rainbow "></pre>
[02:42:01] <walidvb> Cork: check now
[02:42:17] <Cork> ya
[02:42:25] <Cork> try hiding it on load?
[02:42:34] <walidvb> Cork: you mean, after load?
[02:42:47] <walidvb> nah.. i'll just leave it open :D can't be bothered, tbh
[02:42:51] <Cork> no onload the event
[02:42:55] <Cork> ok
[02:43:08] <walidvb> Cork: i don't necessarily need it closed.
[02:43:11] <walidvb> thanks!
[02:43:33] <Cork> walidvb: are you collapsing through display: none?
[02:43:43] <walidvb> Cork: bootstrap is
[02:43:48] <walidvb> through .collapse
[02:43:48] <Cork> that could be the cause as it has a special meaning to browsers
[02:44:23] <Cork> and ya, bootstrap has lots of weirdness with .collapse that break things
[02:46:04] <walidvb> i see that
[02:46:21] <walidvb> nvm, that page is just a quick ref for a course i'm giving
[02:51:41] <PatBateman> hi
[02:51:44] <krambiorix> Hi, in a clickable div i have a delete button. How can i bind the click event to the button?
[02:52:50] <PatBateman> guys you know some specific slider that goes year to year and on every year item show diff html data?
[02:53:02] <PatBateman> like a companys milestones
[02:54:17] <maukkea> I am appending a select with options, but before I do so I'd want to remove all existing options. However when I do this I get undefined options in my select? http://pastebin.com/RQnq8cfp I remove them at line 21
[02:56:05] <maukkea> aah, i never reset i
[02:56:07] <shoky> maukkea you're not resetting that i
[02:56:18] <shoky> maukkea remove that i, and just do  .each(function(i) { ...
[02:56:25] <shoky> and remove the i++ also
[02:56:43] <shoky> you don't even need the i
[02:56:52] <beepbeep_> Can I do something like hook into dom changes? I'd like to call a function when options of a certain select tag change.
[02:57:01] <shoky> .each(function(i, currDayVal) { ... .append(currDayVal)
[03:36:24] <Gama11> is there a way to use a jquery function like .wrap() on an element within an array returned by getElementsByTagName()?
[03:39:11] <kikoandr0id> hey guys, here's a sample code: http://jsfiddle.net/tU73g/ . why doesnt it hide/show? any help with this?
[03:39:31] <Gama11> nevermind, figured it out
[03:41:03] <kikoandr0id> i dont see why it doesnt work
[03:42:24] <kikoandr0id> anyone?
[03:42:59] <Cork> kikoandr0id: ugg there is a LOT of errors in there
[03:43:04] <Cork> id's need #
[03:43:13] <Cork> you use val in one place but then reference value
[03:43:27] <Cork> use prop('disabled' true/false) not attr
[03:44:34] <Cork> parrent => parent
[03:44:49] <Cork> kikoandr0id: http://jsfiddle.net/tU73g/1/
[03:47:19] <kikoandr0id> Cork , that code is by video2brain tuts, but i see they make mistakes
[03:47:43] <Cork> sounds like it is a tutorial you shouldn't be looking at
[03:47:55] <kikoandr0id> yeah, i am changing it imediatelly
[03:48:05] <kikoandr0id> gone with lynda
[03:48:10] <kikoandr0id> went*
[03:58:39] <arxwn> Hello is it possible to add a select menu in a jquery ui dialogs bottom place instead of a standard button?
[03:59:56] <Cork> arxwn: yes
[04:01:06] <Cork> $().dialog('widget').find('.ui-dialog-buttonpane .ui-dialog-buttonset').prepend()
[04:01:21] <Cork> arxwn: or append if you prefer that
[04:04:20] <arxwn> hmm thank you i ll try
[04:04:22] <arxwn> that
[04:10:36] <xqo> how can i check if something still exists? i set this, [<div class=​"tab" id=​"tab_2">​xqo​</div>​], but the next time i want to use it, the element may have been .remove()d.
[04:10:49] <xqo> how can i know whether or not it has been removed already?
[04:11:15] <Cork> xqo: you would have to query the dom
[04:11:19] <Cork> $() <-- query
[04:11:55] <xqo> if($(this_may_be_gone)).length) alert("yep, its still here!");
[04:11:56] <xqo> like so?
[04:12:12] <xqo> do i not need .length?
[04:12:26] <Cork> xqo: yes
[04:12:41] <Cork> you should also do > 0
[04:12:48] <Cork> fo clarity
[04:12:51] <Cork> *for
[04:12:57] <xqo> >0 instead of .length?
[04:13:10] <xqo> oh .length>0 you mean
[04:13:11] <xqo> gotcha
[04:13:14] <xqo> thanks!
[04:15:04] <Cork> xqo: if it is the top of the elements removed you could check parents too
[04:15:12] <Cork> or even just parent()
[04:15:27] <Cork> selector[0].parentNode != null
[04:21:08] <Cork> xqo: even better you can do document.contains(elm)
[04:26:53] <xqo> Cork ah great, that one worked
[04:27:02] <xqo> the other ones gave me true no matter what. thanks!
[04:27:27] <Cork> xqo: this_may_be_gone has to be a string
[04:27:31] <Cork> xqo: in the other example
[04:27:50] <xqo> Cork its an element i got from .next()
[04:27:57] <xqo> .next() or .prev();
[04:28:08] <Cork> well those work on relations
[04:28:21] <Cork> and as long as you hold a reference you will keep them alive
[04:29:01] <Cork> xqo: also note the compatibility section for contains https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node.contains#Browser_compatibility
[04:31:29] <xqo> $(may_be_gone.attr("id")).length
[04:31:37] <xqo> \o/
[04:31:39] <xqo> thank
[04:31:40] <xqo> s
[04:31:59] <Cork> except that won't ever work
[04:32:04] <xqo> but it just did :|
[04:32:09] <Cork> can't
[04:32:17] <xqo> totally just did!
[04:32:27] <Cork> <div id="a"> $(s.attr('id')) => $('a')
[04:32:44] <Cork> so it would select the id as an element
[04:32:51] <Cork> not as an id
[04:33:04] <xqo> "#"+ etc
[04:33:26] <xqo> $("#"+may_be_gone.attr("id")).length
[04:33:32] <xqo> how bout that
[04:33:37] <Cork> would work
[04:34:16] <xqo> thanks
[04:34:30] <Cork> compareDocumentPosition is another option
[04:34:35] <Cork> needs ie9+ though
[04:35:14] <Cork> xqo: but ya contains is most likely safe to use, as i don't think there is many ff < 9 out in the wild
[04:35:26] <Cork> especially as it is ages behind supported versions
[04:36:20] <xqo> you think i should use contains instead of the query?
[04:36:24] <xqo> the $("#"+may_be_gone.attr("id")).length
[04:37:01] <Cork> mixed feelings :)
[04:37:11] <Cork> i find it to be cleaner code
[04:37:18] <marcules> hi there
[04:37:26] <xqo> but the query is more compatible?
[04:37:31] <Cork> but i haven't used it and haven't ran pref tests on it
[04:37:41] <Cork> so i don't know what is the best performant
[04:37:46] <Cork> xqo: sure is
[04:37:47] <xqo> okok
[04:37:48] <xqo> thank you
[04:38:03] <Cork> xqo: and ya it really depends on how performance reliant the code need to be
[04:38:45] <Cork> xqo: btw as a side note the oldest firefox version supported is ff24
[04:38:57] <Cork> so 9 is kinda out of the park by quite a bit
[04:39:13] <Cork> and the rest of the version dependencies for .contains is way out too
[04:39:20] <Cork> (like ie5)
[04:39:47] <Cork> if i was asked to support ie5 i would ask for a neckshot instead
[04:40:07] <Cork> much more humane
[04:40:20] <xqo> haha, yeah no i dont care so much about compatibility with ancient browsers
[04:46:56] <xqo> Cork this time the may_be_gone was undefined, so .attr() failed. here is pseudocode: http://jsfiddle.net/Ckcqu/1/
[04:48:06] <Cork> xqo: is the function recursive or how do the lines stick togeter?
[04:48:36] <xqo> i dont understand
[04:48:47] <Cork> actually i don't get why you do it like that at all
[04:48:58] <xqo> what would you do?
[04:49:04] <Cork> just do $('#tab_3').prev().addClass()
[04:49:14] <Cork> if it doens't exist nothing is modified
[04:49:26] <xqo> its not really addclass
[04:49:39] <xqo> sorry, should have used something else
[04:49:51] <Cork> use a relevant example
[04:49:55] <Cork> and please make it running
[04:59:21] <Ansikt> Hi.  Does anyone know of a jQuery plugin which handles touch (specifically swipe) events, and is relatively small and well tested?
[05:00:09] <seutje> `g hammer js
[05:00:11] <b-ot> seutje: Hammer.js - A javascript library for multi-touch gestures → http://eightmedia.github.io/hammer.js/
[05:00:26] <seutje> Ansikt: ^
[05:00:41] <seutje> only used it like once or twice myself though
[05:01:28] <Ansikt> seutjs: I recently heard on a podcast that hammer was "too big," but looking at the actual page the file's only 3kb so this might be the right solution
[05:06:48] <xqo> Cork making a good example started taking too long hehe.. ill just experiment a little with the live code. never mind!
[05:11:38] <lianzinho> guys… if I have a div, with a text and an anchor inside… and I want to change just the text every time an event fire…what would be the best way?
[05:12:01] <lianzinho> I mean, just like .html() but keeping the a tag
[05:12:14] <Cork> lianzinho: add an additional element around the text
[05:12:25] <Cork> recommended is a span
[05:12:41] <lianzinho> Cork: duh! hahaha, so obvious man! Thanks a lot...
[05:13:01] <lianzinho> sometime we search for way too complicated solutions… hahaha thanks
[06:10:08] <Eliade> Hi
[06:14:38] <sekyms> #jquery
[06:14:41] <sekyms> oops
[06:36:40] <scarlet_razor> hiii bro...
[06:36:41] <scarlet_razor> i loading ajax view but the viewer from ajax respond i losing jquery style how it happen and how the solution
[06:36:59] <Cork> scarlet_razor: "jquery style"?
[06:37:15] <Cork> you mean jquery ui plugins?
[06:37:21] <scarlet_razor> some jquery plugin such as
[06:37:53] <scarlet_razor> like that or other plugin such as Flexslider or else
[06:38:13] <Cork> scarlet_razor: if you load new elements into the page, that need to have js ran on them
[06:38:24] <Cork> you need to call those js functions/plugins again
[06:38:48] <scarlet_razor> ohh... so i need to insert the file jquery again ?
[06:39:07] <Cork> no
[06:39:26] <Cork> but you call $().plugin name to have it modify the dom
[06:39:30] <Cork> you need to do that again
[06:39:46] <Cork> scarlet_razor: if the plugin does it internally, you might not be able to use it with ajax
[06:48:13] <scarlet_razor> Cork: thanks bro
[06:48:33] <scarlet_razor> sorry any reference or example for your solution.. it would be clear if i can read some reference :)
[06:49:07] <Cork> scarlet_razor: the answer was generic cause the question was generic
[06:49:29] <Cork> and no i don't have any examples more then the psudo code i gave you
[06:49:48] <Cork> if you could provide the code you run on page start, i might be able to help
[06:51:24] <scarlet_razor> can u please give me just a bit example bout just using the plugin not insert all jquery xx.js in the ajax view ?
[06:51:38] <Cork> ajax view?
[06:51:50] <Cork> what view are you talking about?
[06:51:51] <scarlet_razor> ajax respond that result view
[06:52:27] <scarlet_razor> when ajax success event trigerred it would ask the server to view some data
[06:52:33] <scarlet_razor> i replace some data with html code
[06:52:52] <Cork> $.ajax(url).done(function(data) { var newContent = $(data); newContent.pluginName(); $(target).append(newContent); })
[06:53:09] <scarlet_razor> and the html code is losing all the javascript plugin that use jquery
[06:53:18] <scarlet_razor> thanks i try to understand your script..
[06:53:21] <Cork> html doesn't have js
[06:53:27] <Cork> so the concept doesn't parse
[06:54:10] <Cork> are you loading a full page through ajax and expect it to work correctly when you append it to the page or something?
[06:54:27] <scarlet_razor> that right.. the respond from ajax is html
[06:54:28] <Cork> more info is needed to be able to tell what happens
[06:54:41] <Cork> and no i won't guess anymore until you provide data
[06:55:00] <scarlet_razor> oke... later.. thanks.. by the way...
[06:58:59] <lianzinho> how do I search for an element with data-stuff="something" ?
[06:59:21] <lianzinho> the query will change it time….
[06:59:36] <Cork> $('[data-stuff=""]')
[06:59:50] <Cork> you want to filter it more though
[07:00:05] <Cork> cause $('[data-stuff=""]') means $('*[data-stuff=""]')
[07:00:15] <Cork> so it will actually loop over every element in the page
[07:00:25] <lianzinho> bit how do I test for the value?
[07:00:34] <Cork> the "" in the selector
[07:00:44] <lianzinho> can I put a variable there?
[07:00:55] <Cork> as long as you concat it to a string
[07:01:26] <lianzinho> $('[data-stuff="'+ variable + '" ]') ?
[07:01:29] <lianzinho> like this?
[07:01:34] <Cork> though you might find it better to do something like $('some-selector').filter(function() { return $(this).data('stuff') == variable; })
[07:01:41] <Cork> less messy code
[07:01:49] <lianzinho> yes
[07:01:51] <alaing> hi
[07:01:54] <lianzinho> hhehehe, much better
[07:01:57] <lianzinho> thanks a lot!
[07:01:57] <Cork> and again you most likely don't want to selecto on *[]
[07:02:21] <Cork> as that literally means check every element in the page and is not good for performance
[07:02:42] <Cork> so make the static selector as precise as you can make it
[07:02:44] <alaing> i have a iframe which has a radio button on it. whe nthe user clicks the radio button i need the iframe to scroll to the bottom
[07:03:04] <alaing> am I right in thinking i need the event listener to be on the parent window?
[07:03:14] <lianzinho> Cork, how can I pass a parameter to this filter function ?
[07:03:21] <lianzinho> from the scope above it
[07:03:41] <lianzinho> I mean, this variable, is above the function
[07:03:47] <Cork> lianzinho: js does that by default
[07:03:53] <Cork> lianzinho: scopes are inherited in js
[07:04:13] <royalty> hello so in an ajax request generally when I use one I am posting to a url, however when the url wants to send me a response does that mean it posts back?
[07:04:25] <Cork> js> var a = "hello"; function test() { print(a); } test()
[07:04:28] <b-ot> Cork: hello
[07:04:59] <Cork> royalty: you can't post back through ajax
[07:05:04] <Cork> it is a one way solution
[07:05:11] <Cork> the client can connect to the server nothing else
[07:05:31] <royalty> Cork, so how does the url respond in this case
[07:05:37] <Cork> royalty: if you want to send data to the client, the client has to pull for data on an interval
[07:05:48] <Cork> royalty: it responds on the original request
[07:06:08] <Cork> http is a request > that always follows by a < response
[07:06:17] <royalty> because so far the first part of my ajax request is posting but trying to send something back for me is failing
[07:06:21] <Cork> nothing is ever initiated by the server
[07:06:33] <royalty> so data is empty
[07:06:44] <Cork> royalty: you just echo out in the script that got the question
[07:06:48] <Cork> *request
[07:06:57] <Cork> royalty: are you using the callback to ajax?
[07:07:20] <royalty> Cork: callback? I am using the success function...
[07:07:27] <Cork> uh no
[07:07:33] <Cork> success isn't a function
[07:07:38] <Cork> what you give to it is a function
[07:07:44] <royalty> ah yeah
[07:07:49] <royalty> is that considered a callback
[07:08:06] <Cork> if you pass a function to another function you are creating a callback yes
[07:08:31] <Cork> open the browser console and inspect what data the server sends back
[07:08:33] <royalty> I get a 500 error when I post
[07:08:41] <Cork> uh
[07:08:44] <royalty> which means the server is not sending anything back
[07:08:45] <Cork> ok so the server crashes
[07:08:48] <royalty> I take it
[07:08:49] <Cork> so fix your server code :)
[07:08:57] <Cork> no it means the server crashes
[07:08:58] <royalty> haha ok I'll try
[07:09:02] <royalty> oh
[07:09:04] <Cork> you have script error or something like that
[07:09:08] <royalty> ohhhhh
[07:09:18] <Cork> ?g wiki http status 500
[07:09:19] <royalty> I probably do
[07:09:20] <b-ot> Cork: List of HTTP status codes - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia → http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes
[07:09:38] <Cork> 500 Internal Server Error
[07:09:38] <Cork>     A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable
[07:09:52] <royalty> Cork, thank you sir
[07:09:52] <Cork> 5xx Server Error <--
[07:10:36] <lianzinho> it is possible to do an inline condition check like this
[07:10:43] <lianzinho> $('.pager a').siblings().hasClass('active').removeClass('active')
[07:10:51] <lianzinho> remove just if hasClass
[07:11:04] <Cork> $('.pager a').siblings('.active').removeClass('active')
[07:11:30] <Cork> hasClass returns true or false so no you can't chain on that
[07:11:40] <Crucials> or you don't have to have the siblings in there at all? just remove all actives?
[07:11:55] <Cork> true
[07:12:00] <Cork> $('.pager a').removeClass('active')
[07:12:17] <Cork> though there isn't a guarantee all the siblings are a tags
[07:12:23] <lianzinho> Cork: I want to add the current active
[07:12:39] <lianzinho> and the others cannot be active
[07:12:43] <Cork> $('.pager a').removeClass('active'); $(this).addClass('active')
[07:12:46] <lianzinho> what would be the best strategy then ?
[07:12:52] <Cork> like so? :)
[07:13:01] <lianzinho> don't know, let me test
[07:13:02] <lianzinho> hehehe
[07:13:36] <Cork> anyway i'm off
[07:13:41] <lianzinho> perfect!
[07:13:43] <lianzinho> :D
[07:14:50] <alaing> i have a iframe which has a radio button on it. whe nthe user clicks the radio button i need the iframe to scroll to the bottom
[07:14:55] <alaing> am I right in thinking i need the event listener to be on the parent window?
[07:15:33] <vsgill> I have an <a> tag with <br> inside it, is there a way to find if the <br> tag is right after opening <a> or just before closing </a>
[07:15:56] <vsgill> I want to move it above or below the <a> tag depending on it's position
[07:16:29] <alaing> vsgrill why not just remove it?
[07:16:32] <decx> it's dirty to do that outside of the markup
[07:16:51] <vsgill> well I want to remove it, but then place it above or below the a tag
[07:17:12] <vsgill> it's content copied over from a clients site and it's over 100 pages
[07:17:19] <alaing> a couple whok use  .text() to get the text without the br
[07:18:21] <alaing> vsgrill you could use .html() to get everythign inside the <a>
[07:18:27] <vsgill> yeah but how do I know if it's right after the opening tag, or just before the closing
[07:18:43] <vsgill> yeah thats a start, maybe use some regular expression?
[07:19:08] <alaing> and then strip out the first couple of characters and/or the last couple of characters and test whose for <br>?
[07:19:29] <vsgill> that sounds like it
[07:19:32] <vsgill> thanks, ill try it now
[07:19:39] <alaing> no problem
[07:22:06] <alaing> could someone help me with iframe?
[07:22:36] <decx> dont ask to ask
[07:22:45] <alaing> i have a iframe which has a radio button on it. whe nthe user clicks the radio button i need the iframe to scroll to the bottom
[07:22:50] <alaing> am I right in thinking i need the event listener to be on the parent window?
[07:23:23] <alaing> I've used .scrollTo() before but thats only within a single page and that page wasn't an iframe content
[07:23:34] <xckpd7> how do I append html in one statement? trying to do this:             $('#grid .white-box:odd').appendTo('div class="column size-1of2"></div>').appendTo('#grid');
[07:23:45] <vsgill> alaing, that worked, thanks!
[07:24:00] <alaing> vsgill: great thanks for letting me know
[07:24:25] <xckpd7> trying to append all the odd html elements into an empty div, and then trying to append that onto something. I'm trying to make it one statement so that it also removes the elements....
[07:26:14] <alaing> xckpd7: jsfiddle example?
[07:26:33] <alaing> or codepen.io if you prefer
[07:29:23] <roelmonnens> anybody working with bower in this channel? I want to work with bower but jQueryUI doesn't have a fully build file in their bower package
[07:30:05] <roelmonnens> does anybody know if I should build this or ... .
[07:30:13] <xckpd7> alaing: I don't really know how I would form that into an example
[07:30:31] <xckpd7> alaing: basically trying to take odd elements, wrap them in a div, and append them somewhere
[07:31:30] <xckpd7> alaing: the only catch is... usually when you append an item from somewhere to another, it removes the item where it was before. So I want that functionality (because if I create a variable and assign the append method to a variable, it won't remove it where it was originally)
[07:31:40] <alaing> xckpd7: one sec
[07:32:53] <alaing> you lost me on the last part
[07:33:10] <alaing> so you want to "remember" where they were before they moved?
[07:38:57] <zorph> $(form).html() doesn't give me the form html with the values present? howto?
[07:39:12] <zorph> I just need to dump a form with values in ..and save that html to DB
[07:40:17] <seutje> zorph: when the value changes, the property changes, not the attribute
[07:40:28] <seutje> hence the HTML will only reflect initial state
[07:41:01] <zorph> I'm dynamically setting values using val(x)
[07:41:04] <seutje> unless you explicitly set the attribute to the same value as the property
[07:41:18] <seutje> zorph: yeah, so ur setting props, not attributes
[07:41:19] <zorph> after val(x)...u can't dump the html with values? weird
[07:41:26] <seutje> the html doesn't change
[07:41:42] <zorph> hm ok
[07:41:50] <zorph> I guess I gotta set attr
[07:42:14] <seutje> or save only the data instead of the entire HTML blob
[07:42:28] <seutje> is the user fucks with the markup on his side, will u just take it as-is and store it like that?
[07:42:46] <seutje> clever user could do some rather nasty stuff then
[07:42:50] <alaing> xckpd7: something like this? http://codepen.io/aliuk12/pen/bIipy
[07:46:27] <zorph> so for radio buttons, I'd have to set attr('checked', 'checked')
[07:55:19] <decx> alaing i forgot i had a fiddle open with your problem :>
[07:55:27] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/2ytSM/
[07:55:58] <alaing> thanks decx just chekcing it out
[07:57:04] <alaing> decx: that goes on the parent page right?
[07:57:22] <decx> yep
[07:57:47] <alaing> Ah, great, thanks for that really appreciate it
[07:58:21] <decx> your question got me thinking that i might want to do that myself on a terrible backend with iframes i haave to work on ;)
[07:58:23] <anthonym> hey guys, any idea what would be causing $.ajax to be trying to parse the response with type "text" when data is received from the server? it shows syntax error in line 1 of the included file when data is received.
[07:58:31] <anthonym> you can see the error at www.dosefly.com
[07:58:47] <alaing> decx: lol - Share my pain
[07:59:17] <anthonym> the data being returned is just plain text.. one line in a file called main.inc.  tho $.ajax tries to parse or call it for some reason? because I am seeing a syntax error after the data is received.
[08:00:17] <anthonym> You can see that the success: function calls successfully, via "Received data! : Main view file for interface 'main' !"
[08:00:39] <anthonym> tho the line previous to this is a syntax error line 1 of the .inc file (the .inc file line 1 is the data you can see in the Received Data:)
[08:01:15] <_rgn> i see no error
[08:01:46] <anthonym> you cant see the 'syntax error' line? :/
[08:02:46] <anthonym> http://i41.tinypic.com/2r21zli.jpg
[08:02:57] <anthonym> thats the error (see syntax error in line 1 of the .inc file?)
[08:03:17] <_rgn> what browser is that
[08:03:25] <anthonym> firefox
[08:04:04] <anthonym> its odd, its like $.ajax is trying to call evaluate the contents of the .inc file :S
[08:05:29] <Cork> anthonym: the file endings has no meaning on the web
[08:05:43] <Cork> anthonym: only thing that matters is what content-type the server sends back for the request
[08:05:52] <anthonym> yeah I know, but the dataType I'm setting is "text"
[08:05:59] <anthonym> yeah
[08:06:08] <Cork> anthonym: that is what the browser will ask for
[08:06:15] <anthonym> I'll change it to .txt to test that theory, thanks
[08:06:16] <Cork> it is still up to the server what it says it sends
[08:06:21] <Cork> anthonym: no
[08:06:25] <Cork> your missing the point
[08:06:41] <Cork> dataType: "text" means ask the server for text response
[08:06:43] <anthonym> I understand that apache sends a content-type header depending on the file attributions
[08:06:56] <Cork> it sends "accept: text/plain" in the request header
[08:07:00] <anthonym> yeah :)
[08:07:19] <Cork> so ya if apache handles .inc wrong then ya things will fail
[08:07:29] <Cork> though normally .inc isn't public in apache
[08:07:35] <Cork> as it is used for passwords and so on
[08:08:09] <_rgn> i still don't see why the browser would try to execute it as source?
[08:08:10] <anthonym> Well thats the odd thing, its working fine, tho javascript is trying to evaluate it
[08:08:34] <anthonym> The data is being received without a problem.. just after the data is received, it is like $.ajax is trying to call the response
[08:09:02] <anthonym> okay awesome, changing it to .txt removes the syntax error
[08:09:08] <anthonym> cheers big ears :)
[08:10:02] <Cork> anthonym: if jquery tries to evaluate it it is cause the server sends the type as application/javascript
[08:10:08] <Cork> or text/javascript
[08:10:16] <Cork> and that will trigger execution in jquery
[08:10:17] <anthonym> yup, perfect thanks mate
[08:10:20] <anthonym> works perfect :)
[08:10:32] <Cork> it's all about the content-type header
[08:10:41] <Cork> nothing else really matters
[08:11:21] <_rgn> i checked the headers and it didn't send that content type
[08:11:34] <_rgn> i think it didn't send one at all
[08:11:50] <_rgn> does firefox assume no content type -> javascript?
[08:11:56] <anthonym> http://www.dosefly.com/ << tis working perfect now :D
[08:11:57] <Cork> no
[08:12:11] <Cork> missing content-type means text/html if i remember correctly
[08:12:14] <Cork> might be text/plain
[08:12:18] <jedimind> not loading for me anthonym
[08:12:40] <anthonym> jedimind: theres no content at the moment, but you can see functionally in console what its doing :)
[08:12:48] <jedimind> ah ok
[08:13:16] <Cork> well you sure loop a lot though :)
[08:15:56] <anthonym> hehe yea, its for a game.  the timer interval is 60 (fps) / 1000 :)
[08:16:26] <jedimind> err
[08:16:26] <Cork> i hope you use requestAnimationFrame...
[08:16:29] <jedimind> yeah ^
[08:16:44] <jedimind> ps 60hz is north america only
[08:16:57] <kikoandr0id> try.jquery.com is freaking amazing :D
[08:16:59] <jedimind> or mostly anyway
[08:17:11] <Cork> jedimind: well no tft monitors are 60hz
[08:17:28] <jedimind> i thought they ran at 50hz in most of europe ?
[08:17:34] <Cork> nope
[08:17:34] <jedimind> otherwise they would cause flickering
[08:17:35] <anthonym> well thank you :)
[08:17:45] <jedimind> unless they have additional capacitors to mitigate that
[08:17:48] <jedimind> i guess that makes sense
[08:18:14] <Cork> jedimind: at least not here in the north of qurop
[08:18:27] <jedimind> well i know that most of electricity grid in europe oscillates at 50hz
[08:18:36] <jedimind> which is what ntsc vs pal exists as an example
[08:18:44] <Cork> never header of tft with any other frequency then 60hz
[08:18:56] <anthonym> I will use requestAnimationFrame :) haven't got to that part yet
[08:19:01] <anthonym> just quickly whipped up the classes
[08:19:07] <jedimind> i know they even have cellphones taht run at 50hz in europe
[08:19:11] <jedimind> like iphone at 50hz
[08:19:13] <jedimind> vs 60hz
[08:19:44] <Cork> btw pal is only for video
[08:19:59] <Cork> games and everything else doens't use that (except consoles)
[08:20:26] <jedimind> what games do you have on your tv that arent on a console?
[08:20:31] <jedimind> :)
[08:20:37] <Cork> i don't have a tv
[08:20:49] <jedimind> Cork let me dig up some info, im talking a bit off the top of my head, i saw some stuff abou tthis topic not too long ago
[08:20:50] <Cork> i game on my computer and there it's always 60Hz
[08:21:24] <Cork> jedimind: as long as you exclude tvs and video sure
[08:40:40] <Whiskey> best way to masure load of JS?

[09:06:03] <duch_kazatel> also - I’d suggest using a plain for in loop instead if it’s a lot of data, since $.each() is so slow.
[09:06:19] <dw0rd> there are only about 8 items in the array
[09:06:22] <dw0rd> text values
[09:06:55] <duch_kazatel> i still suggest it because the speed difference is huge.
[09:07:01] <duch_kazatel> especially if it’s a plain array. but that’s me :)
[09:10:33] <decx> always crushing the each duch_kazatel http://i.imgur.com/i3zilw0.png
[09:10:44] <duch_kazatel> aaahahahaha
[09:10:59] <duch_kazatel> $.each() and inefficient selectors make me saaaad.
[09:16:27] <kpl> I have code (ASP.NET MVC using jQuery) using a number of $.ajax calls, which works in Firefox, but with IE I need to change default Internet options "General" > "Browsing history" > "Settings" > "Temporary Internet Files" > "Check for newer versions of stored pages", from "Automatically" to "Every time I visit the webpage". Instead of telling all users to change these settings, any general...
[09:16:29] <kpl> ...or specific advice on how I can fix my code?
[09:16:39] <Shackleford> Does anyone know why, there is a method .addClass() but no .addId()?
[09:17:02] <kpl> I suppose because you want one id only
[09:17:26] <duch_kazatel> Shackleford that’s an interesting idea.  probably because replacing an ID would be funky business.
[09:18:04] <decx> you can force it with .attr('id','newid') though
[09:18:25] <duch_kazatel> kpl - check out the “cache” option for $.ajax();
[09:18:26] <decx> but id is called id for a reason, it's an id ^^
[09:18:36] <Shackleford> Honestly, I'm not as curious about addId(), as I am .removeId();  it seems like it would be useful
[09:18:44] <duch_kazatel> it appends a _={timestamp}
[09:18:50] <Shackleford> true
[09:18:54] <decx> Shackleford attr('id','')
[09:19:05] <Velveeta> .removeAttr('id')
[09:19:10] <decx> right
[09:19:15] <decx> that's probably better
[09:19:23] <sekyms> I know you wont share this with anyone
[09:19:25] <Shackleford> that is what I used, but just curious why it wasn't a specific method
[09:19:26] <sekyms> shoot
[09:19:28] <sekyms> wrong window
[09:19:33] <RTPMatt> An element can only have one ID, but it can have many classes.
[09:19:37] <kpl> duch_kazatel: thanks, I will
[09:19:46] <Velveeta> probably because id's aren't augmented as often as classes, so there's less need for a function like that
[09:19:51] <duch_kazatel> since any ID should only ever exist once per page, to me you should be managing them on your own.
[09:19:53] <RTPMatt> To add/remove a class, you have to update the list of classes for the element.
[09:20:07] <RTPMatt> For an ID, you sinly make the ID whatever you are setting it to.
[09:20:09] <duch_kazatel> RTPMatt you can also use .addClass() and .removeClass()
[09:20:12] <Shackleford> duch_kazatel, make sense
[09:20:16] <Shackleford> makes*
[09:20:20] <Shackleford> thx
[09:20:25] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[09:21:36] <RTPMatt> duch_kazatel - That is my point, addClass/removeClass exist because it is much more complicated than adding/removing an ID
[09:23:19] <duch_kazatel> RTPMatt precisely.  I was trying to be clear that you aren’t necessarily managing the list yourself - there are convenience methods for that.
[09:23:23] <duch_kazatel> but you are correct.
[09:24:12] <Shackleford> RTPMatt, got ya
[09:24:44] <RTPMatt> cool
[09:27:55] <dw0rd> On a different note, I am having trouble with .each properly iterating through a simple object
[09:27:56] <dw0rd> http://pastebin.com/mBK3bhuY
[09:28:04] <dw0rd> I don't see why it wouldn't work
[09:28:42] <duch_kazatel> i take it line 13 is your data?
[09:29:02] <dw0rd> thats the output in the console from the console.log function duch_kazatel
[09:29:03] <dw0rd> so yes
[09:29:17] <Velveeta> looks like it's receiving data as a string, not an object
[09:29:29] <duch_kazatel> ^^^ what Velveeta said
[09:29:30] <Velveeta> try specifying dataType: 'json' in your ajax request
[09:29:31] <dw0rd> So i should typecast it?
[09:29:35] <dw0rd> ah ok
[09:32:03] <cortexman> is there a way to get a reference to a deeply nested object so I don't have to keep calling its full path? i.e., $("#blah").next().children("input")
[09:32:15] <duch_kazatel> cortexman yup - cache your selectors.
[09:32:43] <duch_kazatel> cortexman though in your case, .next() will require that you keep calling the full path like that.
[09:33:06] <duch_kazatel> and dw0rd - http://jsfiddle.net/yfM5z/1/ - for the native for loop version.
[09:36:08] <dw0rd> thanks duch_kazatel
[09:36:30] <duch_kazatel> dw0rd of course.
[09:40:11] <maxmoore14> can anyone confirm if the jqm themeroller is broken for 1.4? There may be more than one issue, but specifically I can't get the black icons to work at all. Tried multiple browsers.
[09:43:58] <duch_kazatel> maxmoore14 are you finding evidence to corroborate your claim elsewhere?
[09:44:04] <duch_kazatel> ie - is it broken for just you?
[09:44:30] <maxmoore14> duch_kazatel: that's what I'm asking...
[09:44:41] <duch_kazatel> ah - misread what you put.
[09:45:15] <maxmoore14> just go to http://themeroller.jquerymobile.com/ and try to change the icon color to black
[09:45:25] <maxmoore14> does it have any effect?
[09:46:34] <decx> can confirm, icon stays white
[09:46:38] <duch_kazatel> same here.
[09:47:11] <maxmoore14> ok, I'll file a bug on github
[09:47:13] <maxmoore14> thx
[09:49:50] <duch_kazatel> yeah looks like that default icon is the only thing that doesn’t work.
[09:49:58] <decx> the .ui-alt-icon doesnt get set
[09:59:25] <cortexman> duch_kazatel, is there a cacheable way for me to access that path?
[09:59:40] <duch_kazatel> cortexman not if you’re using .next()
[09:59:44] <duch_kazatel> you don’t want to cache that selector.
[10:00:27] <duch_kazatel> if you cache it, you’ll get the same result back every time.
[10:00:35] <duch_kazatel> there a reason you need to use .next()?
[10:00:51] <cortexman> jqueryui creates the next element dynamically..
[10:03:04] <duch_kazatel> bummer.
[10:03:13] <duch_kazatel> then you can’t cache it anyway.
[10:03:18] <duch_kazatel> because your selection set changes.
[10:15:24] <Ritzton> hello
[10:15:34] <duch_kazatel> whuddup
[10:31:28] <atan> Does jQuery have anything to detect these newer high-res displays?
[10:32:52] <duch_kazatel> atan not natively.
[10:33:49] <duch_kazatel> atan why do you ask?
[10:38:30] <Ericx2x> can someone solve why this doesnt work?
[10:38:31] <Ericx2x> http://jsfiddle.net/7Z93k/
[10:40:00] <shoky> Ericx2x: because jsfiddle scripts are not put in the global scope, so your function isn't global. don't use onclick attributes
[10:40:27] <shoky> also it's getElementById
[10:40:38] <shoky> Ericx2x: http://jsfiddle.net/7Z93k/1/
[10:41:17] <shoky> er well since you're using jquery.. http://jsfiddle.net/7Z93k/3/
[10:41:22] <Ericx2x> shoky your js fiddle doesnt work?
[10:41:23] <Ericx2x> ok
[10:47:48] <shoky> they both work..?
[11:09:27] <foo> Accordion is default functionality within jquery, right? Or do I need to include a separate jquery library for that?
[11:10:41] <duch_kazatel> that’s jqueryui
[11:11:20] <foo> duch_kazatel: ahh, thanks
[11:22:56] <Juc1> Hi all - newbie question please - this google map code http://pastebin.com/1LtB7C3s works only in my first jquery tab but not second etc tabs = http://map-test-230114.hillfish.co.uk - can anyone see anything helpful in the console or any other suggestions please?
[11:29:14] <akkufomk> how do I get the document height from inside an iframe.  I've tried everything and the document height is always returning 0
[11:33:12] <duch_kazatel> akkufomk can you clarify “document height”?
[11:36:28] <akkufomk> duch_kazatel: http://brianshim.com/webtricks/dynamically-resize-an-iframe-using-jquery/  this is what I'm doing but it doesn't work
[11:36:34] <akkufomk> it always returns 0
[11:39:31] <duch_kazatel> do you have some code to share in a fiddle?
[11:41:09] <akkufomk> hang on I'm discussing with coworker
[12:13:37] <InSighter> <<<< www.TheShowBay.tv - Watch all shows for free! >>>>
[12:14:22] <Onionnion> I'm trying to get jquery to set the value of a text field to the extension of a file by default but for some reason it isn't finding the nearest text field it seems? http://jsfiddle.net/Windsock/myD5c/1/ .change() is being called and its own value is being processed correctly
[12:15:25] <Onionnion> I'd like to use .closest() because I have other fields but there's only one of type=text that's associated with this
[12:16:01] <shoky> Onionnion .closest() searches UP the dom.  in your example .siblings() would work
[12:16:50] <Onionnion> shoky, ohh ok, let me try
[12:17:16] <Onionnion> shoky, yup that works, thanks!
[12:28:47] <Ericx2x> anyone kwnow what this error means? https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12883232/error9.png
[12:29:03] <duch_kazatel> which error?
[12:29:09] <duch_kazatel> the last one?
[12:30:58] <duch_kazatel> the last one should be self explanatory.
[12:31:09] <Onionnion> eh, that last fiddle didn't have the right HTML for where it's really being put, this is what it's like and it still can't find it, tried some different functions: http://jsfiddle.net/Windsock/fxu7F/1/
[12:31:18] <duch_kazatel> the first one means that there’s probably a key/value pair that’s broken somewhere.
[12:32:23] <duch_kazatel> Onionnion what are you trying to do?
[12:32:47] <Onionnion> duch_kazatel, set the value of the text field to the extension of the file
[12:34:18] <Onionnion> duch_kazatel, just realized that I forgot to turn on jQuery in that fiddle..heh
[12:35:28] <Ericx2x> The syntax error is complaining here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12883232/error10.png
[12:36:05] <duch_kazatel> eric  line 32
[12:36:09] <duch_kazatel> err, Ericx2x
[12:36:19] <duch_kazatel> the colon is broken.
[12:36:30] <duch_kazatel> shouldn’t be in side the quotes.
[12:36:34] <Onionnion> yeah I can't get it to find the second <input>
[12:44:49] <duch_kazatel> Onionnion you’re targeting things wrong.
[12:45:14] <duch_kazatel> $(this).find("label") - you’re looking for the label child element of $("input[type=file]")
[12:46:38] <duch_kazatel> Onionnion in this case, $(this) is going to be $("input[type=file]").
[12:46:58] <Onionnion> oh jeez I need to review targeting in jQuery
[12:47:27] <decx> you can just use siblings like before ;)
[12:47:35] <decx> because this label is a sibling of your input
[12:48:26] <Onionnion> decx, oh, I thought I tried siblings() on this
[12:48:41] <Onionnion> guess not exactly in this code, must have mistaken myself
[12:48:50] <decx> you probably had sibling('input')
[12:48:59] <decx> but now with the label the sibling is ('label')
[12:49:10] <Onionnion> ok now I got it working, thanks
[13:21:38] <atan> Any ideas why this isn't adding the class as I would expect? I'm stumped
[13:21:38] <atan> http://pastebin.com/6WC9ZJYy
[13:22:16] <decx> it's executing on load and not when jquery is ready
[13:22:52] <atan> decx, ahh. Okay so that would explain why the if matches right away, but I need to add something else in there
[13:23:16] <atan> Do I need to wrap the entire thing with $(document).ready(function(){?
[13:23:30] <duch_kazatel> atan yes.
[13:23:52] <decx> for a simple snippet like that you can just do document.getElementsByTagName('body').className = 'mobile'
[13:24:01] <decx> if you want it on load
[13:24:01] <duch_kazatel> atan OR be a cool kid do $(function() {});
[13:24:13] <decx> which is preferable on a mobile switcher
[13:24:20] <atan> Drat, so http://pastebin.com/6bvW19ex didn't do what I thought there's no mobile class on there
[13:25:48] <atan> decx, tred putting document.getElementsByTagName('body').className = 'mobile'; in the middle there but didn't seem to add it in there, at least it's not showing in Chrome when I inspect the page
[13:26:01] <kg> Hi, how to set a whole table row (tr) on display: none on click?
[13:26:41] <duch_kazatel> $(‘tr’).on(‘click’, function(){$(this).css(‘display’, ‘none’)});
[13:26:43] <duch_kazatel> that’s one way
[13:27:42] <decx> atan works fine here if i emulate iphone http://jsfiddle.net/cJKuf/
[13:28:09] <kg> thank you duch_kazatel
[13:28:12] <duch_kazatel> kg sure
[13:28:16] <Zzaichik> I'd say adding/removing classnames would be a better way.
[13:28:36] <atan> Hmm... well that's strange. Okay CloudFlare must be re-writing something on me.
[13:28:39] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: You have IE available?
[13:29:01] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell yep - I am a windows user, after all :)
[13:29:22] <Jeebs> lol
[13:29:55] <duch_kazatel> one of us devs has to use this shit on the OS our users are stuck with!
[13:29:59] <BillCriswell> Is this smooth in it? http://ssb.criswell.mixture.io It runs smoothly in Chrome, but not as well in Firefox and Safari on my Mac. I was just curious as to IE handles it.
[13:30:12] <Jeebs> How can I detirmine the what height a div would be if it were set to auto if it's currently set to 0px?
[13:30:14] <duch_kazatel> which IE?  11?
[13:30:17] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha. I had a snow day. No IE at home.
[13:30:28] <BillCriswell> Whichever, just not ancient.
[13:30:38] <duch_kazatel> Jeebs you have to set it to auto.
[13:30:54] <duch_kazatel> IE11 is pretty decent
[13:30:57] <Zzaichik> If you've set the height to 0, jQuery will return the height as 0
[13:31:32] <Jeebs> So there's no easy to way to claculate what the height would be? (Coming from swing dev which allows you to compute that)
[13:31:49] <BillCriswell> IE11 sounds good haha.
[13:31:51] <duch_kazatel> not really.
[13:32:12] <duch_kazatel> 11 is about the same as chrome on my machine, BillCriswell
[13:32:18] <BillCriswell> Awesome.
[13:32:27] <Zzaichik> the dev tools in ie11 are so much nicer
[13:32:27] <duch_kazatel> Jeebs the element has to be rendered for jquery to know wtf is up.
[13:32:36] <Jeebs> k, thanks
[13:32:40] <duch_kazatel> “ie11 is so much nicer”
[13:32:47] <decx> atan i always use the jquery version of detectmobilebrowser.js, that gives a nice jQuery.browser.mobile if true
[13:32:47] <duch_kazatel> there i fixed that for you.
[13:32:58] <Zzaichik> don't twist my words man
[13:32:59] <Zzaichik> haha
[13:33:07] <BillCriswell> Have firefox open as well by any chance? Thnk that's what the client is using and on Firefox Mac is doesn't feel very smooth.
[13:33:09] <duch_kazatel> nah that’s me.
[13:33:22] <Zzaichik> I guess it is compared to <=IE10
[13:33:28] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell sure - i do most of my work in FF.
[13:33:40] <duch_kazatel> it’s a little slower/choppier, but not by much in FF>
[13:33:41] <decx> ff in win works great BillCriswell
[13:33:59] <decx> very responsive and quick
[13:34:07] <BillCriswell> Ok awesome. Thanks guys!
[13:34:18] <atan> Thank you for making that demo decx. Mine still isn't working, but no fault of that otherwise sweet example.
[13:34:19] <duch_kazatel> and Zzaichik IE10 was pretty good.  9 was the start of them being decent.
[13:34:20] <decx> now i wish i had a client that had to display giant pictures to work with that as well :>
[13:34:26] <atan> When I look in console I see "Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLDocument> has no method 'ready' "
[13:35:00] <atan> Seems it might be modernizer messing it up, will play with that
[13:35:14] <BillCriswell> decx: OpenSeadragon makes it pretty easy.
[13:38:14] <atan> Yay! Okay, got it. You rock, thank you a million decx and duch_kazatel
[13:50:44] <giustoXricordarv>    diffondete http://youtu.be/WT6huelHi44
[13:53:35] <BillCriswell> Hm.
[13:53:46] <BillCriswell> K-Lined? Isn't that like serious shit? haha
[13:54:51] <duch_kazatel> yeah that’s a server ban
[13:54:57] <duch_kazatel> “kill line:
[13:55:16] <koniiiik> Hmm, I'm getting a TypeError: Cannot convert 't' to object each time I try to do $(response) where response is a XMLDocument returned by an AJAX call...
[13:55:25] <duch_kazatel> koniiiik have a fiddle?
[13:55:53] <koniiiik> duch_kazatel: I'll try to cook one up, but I'm trying to access the Last.fm API...
[13:56:03] <koniiiik> I'll try to make a dummy XML thing.
[13:56:46] <BillCriswell> just went to code something and remembered I already did it. Love when that happens.
[13:56:51] <duch_kazatel> right?!
[13:57:02] <BillCriswell> I mean, it sucks when I code it twice, but when I catch it it's awesome.
[13:57:11] <duch_kazatel> or when you thought ahead so much earlier that something was significantly easier than you originally planned?
[13:57:46] <BillCriswell> That is awesome as well.
[14:00:52] <BillCriswell> It gets me in trouble sometimes. I'll be asked to think about something but not code it out but it's like talking to a wall.
[14:01:55] <akkufomk> duch_kazatel: found my issue my div had display: none at the time of reading the height
[14:02:16] <akkufomk> duch_kazatel: needed to delegate better
[14:09:59] <dwarder> how do i create a tree like object
[14:16:29] <koniiiik> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/7Rxnu/1/ seems to reproduce the error.
[14:19:01] <NoiseEee> koniiiik: i don't understand why you're calling html()

[14:20:55] <nhulea> hey so I am loading this html file http://pastebin.com/LGRiN6gs via ajax but I was looking to only load the scripts one time is there a better way to do what I am doing because the multiple loads of paper_splat.js is causing changes in the way the canvas is being rendered
[14:21:19] <nhulea> I can show a link where it is working
[14:23:56] <PenguinMan98> does anyone else have trouble with jqueryui tabs in mobile browsers?
[14:24:12] <PenguinMan98> They seem to work in chrome but not the default android browser
[14:33:13] <decx> PenguinMan98 just tried the jq ui tabs demo page and it works fine on the stock browser
[14:33:32] <PenguinMan98> huh.  I wonder what I screwed up then
[14:34:21] <PenguinMan98> The only difference I can suppose is that they aren't on the page at page load. They appear dynamically if the browser is resized too small
[14:34:52] <decx> that sounds like all sorts of potential hazards ;)
[14:35:13] <hesco> I'm writing my first jquery, at this for less than a week now.  In my qunit test script I want to click a radio button and watch to see if the right html elements get hidden and revealed.  How far off is this as a way of activating the .change on that radio button's status?  $('input:radio[name=option_group]').val('this_choice'):checked;
[14:35:14] <PenguinMan98> Don't say that. You'll take the wind out of my sails
[14:35:21] <PenguinMan98> :p
[14:37:00] <BillCriswell> PenguinMan98: The HTML is added if the browser is small enough or the elements become visible if the browser is small enough?
[14:37:43] <PenguinMan98> give the radio an id and just make a $('#some_id').on('click', function(){ if($('#some_id').attr('checked')){} });
[14:37:55] <PenguinMan98> I think
[14:38:40] <PenguinMan98> BillCriswell: I have a polling function that checks the width of the window every 5 seconds. If the width shrinks, it resizes the browser and mutates the layout to compensate.
[14:38:57] <BillCriswell> hesco: You'd want to use .trigger('change')
[14:39:31] <hesco> Thanks BillCriswell, will test that.
[14:41:26] <BillCriswell> PenguinMan98: So you're adjusting the elements the tabs are applied to?
[14:41:45] <bureq> Hi, any idea how I'd load this "<script src="http://www.adserver.tld/"></script>" in a webpage without it "blocking" page rendering? async and defer won't work, script does document.write...
[14:42:52] <PenguinMan98> Basically.  In this case, the div with the tabs is hidden and the three content panes are displayed side by side if there is room for them.  If the browser shrinks, then I move the content panes into the tab thing and make it visible
[14:43:34] <BillCriswell> When and where are you calling the ui tabs on it?
[14:43:45] <PenguinMan98> double checking
[14:44:06] <PenguinMan98> OK, I do it at page load.
[14:44:41] <PenguinMan98> So I do create the tabs at page load but they may or may not be visible
[14:46:16] <decx> PenguinMan98 i just tried something because i was curious http://jsfiddle.net/QAZ7N/
[14:46:40] <decx> no tabs on big screen, tabs on small and resize to small
[14:47:06] <PenguinMan98> Yep. Like that
[14:47:06] <io_______> hi if i have an array as {title = "mytitle", field = "myfield"} how can i substitute those strings with a variable?
[14:48:35] <PenguinMan98> Now the trick is, you can't resize the browser in mobile
[14:48:43] <PenguinMan98> But you can zoom
[14:49:06] <BillCriswell> io_______: That's not javascript.
[14:49:10] <PenguinMan98> What I did is write a function that watches for zoom and programatically resizes the browser when it happens.
[14:49:21] <BillCriswell> PenguinMan98: http://jsbin.com/UpeSiXu/1/edit?html,output Does this approach work?
[14:50:24] <decx> nice BillCriswell media queries are always better
[14:50:44] <BillCriswell> io_______: I think you want an object. You'd do this for an object { title: titleVar, field: fieldVar }
[14:51:01] <PenguinMan98> Getting closer yeah
[14:51:15] <io_______> BillCriswell: yes it is an object inside an array
[14:51:18] <PenguinMan98> I've heard media queries arent' reliable so I've been avoiding them.
[14:51:25] <PenguinMan98> Maybe I need to read more?
[14:51:42] <decx> much more reliable than js for this sort of thing
[14:51:44] <decx> imo
[14:51:59] <BillCriswell> PenguinMan98: There's polyfills for older browser. What browsers do you need to support?
[14:52:25] <PenguinMan98> I probably don't want to go much further than IE8
[14:52:36] <io_______> BillCriswell: ok i was using $myvar... just myvar works
[14:53:00] <BillCriswell> $myvar should work to, depending on what the variable's name is.
[14:53:14] <decx> PenguinMan98 any relevant mobile browser supports media queries, ie8 can get a default desktop version
[14:53:34] <BillCriswell> PenguinMan98: You would need a polyfill for ie8, but ie9+ would be all right.
[14:54:02] <BillCriswell> This way would leave ie8 with the mobile view, since it's mobile first.
[14:55:10] <BillCriswell> PenguinMan98: https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond for ie8
[14:58:30] <decx> works surprisingly well BillCriswell i might be able to trash the good old ie8.css
[15:00:33] <PenguinMan98> The idea though is to resize and mutate the site when the user zooms on it.  So they can pick the look and feel they like best on the fly.
[15:00:54] <PenguinMan98> But that may be too much work for not enough result
[15:03:29] <BillCriswell> PenguinMan98: If you zoom in on the example I gave you it'll use the mobile view. Is that what you mean?
[15:04:04] <PenguinMan98> on this? http://jsbin.com/UpeSiXu/1/edit
[15:04:31] <BillCriswell> PenguinMan98: http://jsbin.com/UpeSiXu/1 go here and just command + it.
[15:05:44] <PenguinMan98> looking at that in the default android browser, if I zoom in all the way, the tabs do not appear
[15:06:27] <BillCriswell> Oh, mobile browser.
[15:07:02] <PenguinMan98> Yeah, mobile browser
[15:07:32] <nhulea> hey I am using $.getscript is there a way to load a script other than type="text/javascript" I am using type="text/paperscript" ?
[15:07:56] <BillCriswell> Not sure there would be a way to accomplish that. So when you like zoom into a specific area of a page you want that part of the page to react?
[15:08:15] <duch_kazatel> nhulea getScript is explicitly for javascript.
[15:08:43] <PenguinMan98> Basically I watch the page for a zoom and detect the new pixel width of the viewport. Then I use jquery to set the body width of the page to that width.
[15:08:45] <duch_kazatel> nhulea try using $.ajax() instead - getscript is really a shorthand
[15:08:55] <nhulea> well that makes sense cause it has not worked at all
[15:09:06] <nhulea> then use dataType right ?
[15:09:14] <duch_kazatel> nhulea probably.
[15:09:19] <nhulea> ok
[15:09:44] <PenguinMan98> dataType doesn't have a 'paperscript' option.  But It does do plain text
[15:09:51] <PenguinMan98> iirc
[15:10:22] <hesco> I have jquery code which works fine when executed on the primary html, but when I load the page used for qunit testing, none of the .show()/.hide() are working when $('#list_options [type=radio]:not(:checked)').change() with those broken, of course my unit tests of that behavior crash.  But the code works fine on the real page, with exactly the same markup.
[15:10:29] <duch_kazatel> ah, yeah PenguinMan98 is right.
[15:10:40] <ezio> is there a way to load an xml document locally
[15:11:05] <PenguinMan98> exio: what are you using it for?
[15:11:12] <ezio> utility
[15:11:15] <duch_kazatel> nhulea does this help? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14110205/dynamically-loading-a-script-changes-its-behaviour
[15:11:49] <PenguinMan98> I would load the XML using PHP's simpleXML and then pass the variables to the html that way.
[15:12:34] <PenguinMan98> are you expecting the XML to change while the user is reading the page?
[15:12:41] <ezio> no
[15:12:44] <ezio> just one read
[15:13:00] <PenguinMan98> Then yeah. It's probably easier to parse it server side and just send what you need to the browser
[15:13:38] <ezio> that's why i said locally.  i want it to work without a server
[15:14:01] <PenguinMan98> So a standalone javascript app. No webserver?
[15:14:08] <nhulea> duch_kazatel: cool that looks like what I am running into kinda
[15:14:14] <ezio> PenguinMan98, right
[15:15:27] <PenguinMan98> the $.ajax() function can take a filename for the source parameter iirc. Then set the DataType to XML
[15:15:37] <ezio> hmm
[15:16:37] <PenguinMan98> instead of a url
[15:17:27] <PenguinMan98> but I hesitate to answer since I've never used javascript/jquery that way
[15:20:32] <foo> Can a lightbox be a circle?
[15:21:31] <PenguinMan98> foo: if you super round the corners, sure
[15:21:41] <PenguinMan98> hehe
[15:21:51] <foo> PenguinMan98: haha, true, true
[15:22:16] <PenguinMan98> I've done something similar before
[15:22:28] <PenguinMan98> to draw a circle around a number
[15:23:54] <io_______> now, can i do something like   var content = $.get( "html/page1.html" ); to get the content of a file in a variable?
[15:24:54] <PenguinMan98> If you can that might be an answer to ezio's question
[15:25:31] <io_______> ezio: you need to tweak your server to load locally
[15:25:58] <ezio> io_______, i have no server
[15:26:17] <io_______> get one, it s free
[15:26:52] <PenguinMan98> ezio: also try the #javascript channel
[15:27:26] <ezio> io_______, i don't want to ... i want this to work offline so that everyone else doesn't have to install a local server
[15:31:23] <PenguinMan98> The thing that screams to me though is that javascript wasn't built to interface with any kind of operating system.  It was built around the idea that all it needed would be given to it before it began.
[15:31:40] <PenguinMan98> usually via html from the browser
[15:32:06] <ezio> yeah me too ... i came with the assumption that it wasn't possible
[15:32:49] <ezio> i wrote my own hook into iis to server up pages.  i just don't have that code here right now and we're renovating so i can't get remote access either.
[15:33:02] <PenguinMan98> Ezio: have you considered alternatives like Java console apps?
[15:34:18] <ezio> PenguinMan98, no.  this is a prototype for something that will eventually be served up on that code
[15:34:35] <PenguinMan98> I see.
[15:35:46] <PenguinMan98> And there is no way in hell the browser would ever let a javascript access files on the client system
[15:36:05] <PenguinMan98> So you'd need a different interpreter for it
[15:36:15] <PenguinMan98> Something that did have access to the filesystem
[15:39:50] <PenguinMan98> ezio:  http://javascript.cs.lmu.edu/notes/commandlinejs/
[15:40:23] <PenguinMan98> that seems to be what you're looking for
[15:42:59] <xp_prg> can anyone recommend a good jquery graph library?
[15:45:00] <PenguinMan98> I use fusioncharts but I don't think that's specific to jquery
[15:45:02] <io_______> still trying to get $.get in a variable http://codepad.org/qYYaBjVu
[15:46:37] <PenguinMan98> io_______: $.get is a shorthand for $.ajax with a method set to 'get'
[15:47:24] <io_______> PenguinMan98: I dont understand how to get the variable out of th efunction
[15:47:45] <PenguinMan98> io_______: let's start over. What exactly are you trying to do?
[15:48:06] <io_______> PenguinMan98: read a file, get its content and set the content to a variable
[15:48:17] <io_______> use the variable on the following function
[15:48:26] <xp_prg> fusion charts is not gpl'd
[15:48:45] <PenguinMan98> io_______: is this file stored on the server?  What format is it in?
[15:49:00] <io_______> PenguinMan98: some html stuff
[15:49:13] <io_______> just markup
[15:49:35] <PenguinMan98> if you enter the url for that file in the browser, does it bring up the markup?
[15:49:50] <dems> hi
[15:49:54] <io_______> PenguinMan98: yes I get the alert properly so it s there
[15:50:23] <dems> in http://api.jquery.com/data/ the last-value reference isnt correct, can someone contact right ppl to fix?
[15:50:46] <duch_kazatel> dems huh?
[15:51:01] <PenguinMan98> OK.
[15:52:03] <duch_kazatel> dems ah you’re talking about data-last-value="43" and $( "div" ).data( "lastValue" ) === 43;
[15:52:15] <dems> yes boss
[15:52:31] <PenguinMan98> io_______: this might be easier: http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ajax_load.asp
[15:53:01] <dems> i'm just apleb noone will listen to me
[15:53:11] <dems> mb there issomeone important here...
[15:53:32] <duch_kazatel> dems nope.  you’d need to fiule a bug.
[15:53:36] <io_______> PenguinMan98: I don t want to add the data to an html element (at least not was that my initial idea)
[15:53:44] <duch_kazatel> wat
[15:53:46] <PenguinMan98> ok
[15:53:56] <dems> nope i did my part
[15:54:00] <io_______> PenguinMan98: I want to add it to an object inside an array
[15:54:02] <dems> filed in #jquery
[15:54:04] <duch_kazatel> dems huh?
[15:54:07] <duch_kazatel> you didn’t file a bug.
[15:54:13] <duch_kazatel> this is not a reliable way to file a bug.
[15:54:21] <dems> c'ya nerds
[15:54:26] <duch_kazatel> the shit?
[15:54:57] <Tjololo12> this might be too simplistic (and I'm sorry if it is), but say I have the HTML for a webpage (from <html> to </html>). Is there a way in jquery to create a new div in front of the current page and render the HTML inside of that? If that doesn't make sense please let me know, first time really trying anything like this in jquery.
[15:55:35] <duch_kazatel> dems - https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues file a bug here.
[15:55:43] <duch_kazatel> that’s where bugs go.
[15:56:44] <PenguinMan98> io_______: Try something like this: http://screencast.com/t/3gKgxs9heL7o
[15:58:29] <io_______> Tjololo12: PenguinMan98 what is "request variable"?
[15:58:51] <io_______> oops
[15:59:01] <PenguinMan98> normal GET stuff
[15:59:22] <io_______> Tjololo12: see what PenguinMan98 wrote before http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ajax_load.asp
[15:59:39] <io_______> Tjololo12: you may have to .prepend for example before
[15:59:45] <xp_prg> wow nobody can recommend a gpl'd bar chart library?
[16:00:25] <PenguinMan98> xp_prg: try in #javascript
[16:00:32] <xp_prg> I have
[16:00:33] <Tjololo12> io_______: will that work for the full HTML, or should I select a child element to load it?
[16:00:41] <PenguinMan98> Tjololo12: Sounds to me like you want an iframe
[16:01:36] <io_______> Tjololo12: when yo usay "render the HTML inside of that" you mean html code or the whole html page?
[16:01:40] <PenguinMan98> Tjololo12: If you want the inner content to be a fully rendered html page, then you need to use an iframe.  If you're just trying to make a div with some content appear that you can put some form or stuff in, then try the blockUI plugin.
[16:02:51] <Tjololo12> PenguinMan98, io_______: Ok, I have the full HTML, but I can delve into it to get other tags, etc. I was trying to steer clear from iframes and keep everything in the same frame, same context. I'll look into that plugin, thanks PenguinMan98. I'll probably be back in here in a bit as the code gets written with more questions lol
[16:03:45] <PenguinMan98> no sweat
[16:04:01] <decx> io_______ did you solve your load to var problem?
[16:04:15] <io_______> PenguinMan98: hard time to use that code, can t I just do myvar = $.get( "path") ;
[16:04:16] <decx> just came back and was still scrolled up :>
[16:04:24] <io_______> decx: nop
[16:04:44] <decx> if you set the var globally beforehand you can return your data into that
[16:04:46] <decx> mom
[16:04:54] <io_______> decx: i tried that
[16:05:01] <io_______> http://codepad.org/qYYaBjVu
[16:05:26] <PenguinMan98> io_______: Did you put the $.get inside the default onpageload handler?
[16:05:51] <PenguinMan98> $(document).ready(function() { put stuff to load on page load here}
[16:06:13] <decx> io_______ http://jsfiddle.net/Yj9ce/
[16:06:21] <io_______> PenguinMan98: $.get gets the data properly as I can see it in an alert
[16:07:05] <Siecje> How can you check if an id contains a substring? I have fields
[16:07:05] <Siecje> <input id="id_experience-0-start_date" name="experience-0-start_date" value="2014-01-14" type="text">
[16:07:05] <Siecje> Where the only that changes is the 0 in id_experience-0-start_date will become a 1 , 2 .. etc
[16:07:42] <duch_kazatel> $(‘input’).attr(‘id’).indexOf(‘substring’);
[16:07:46] <PenguinMan98> io_______:  the return statement on line 12 wont do anything useful
[16:08:00] <decx> io_______ oops forgot a / http://jsfiddle.net/Yj9ce/1/
[16:08:29] <decx> worked from the root but not on the saved url ;)
[16:11:04] <PenguinMan98> I still think the most compact solution is:
[16:11:09] <PenguinMan98> var someArray = [];
[16:11:14] <PenguinMan98> $.get("some url",{},function(response){	someArray.push(response);});
[16:11:30] <decx> true
[16:11:42] <duch_kazatel> why do you need an array for that?
[16:11:57] <PenguinMan98> That's how io_______  wanted it
[16:12:01] * PenguinMan98 shrugs
[16:12:11] <duch_kazatel> welp okay
[16:12:51] <io_______> PenguinMan98: your solution is that instead of trying to load html in a variable i push the content directly into the array right?
[16:13:20] <PenguinMan98> Mine takes the html response and pushes it into the array as a string
[16:13:45] <Siecje> duch_kazatel:  $('input').attr('id').indexOf('start_date');
[16:13:46] <Siecje> 19:13:14.102 TypeError: $(...).attr(...) is undefined
[16:13:53] <PenguinMan98> Then you can use $('someelement').html( and give it that string here) to add it to your DOM
[16:14:09] <duch_kazatel> why not just var yourHoldingCell; $.get("some url",{},function(response){yourHoldingCell = response});
[16:14:30] <io_______> PenguinMan98: i am not creating html there just passing data to another function (an image slider)
[16:14:32] <duch_kazatel> Siecje that was a simple example - you’ll have to modify the selector obviously.
[16:14:37] <Siecje> This is what I am trying to do https://dpaste.de/0LgC
[16:14:55] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:14:59] <PenguinMan98> well whatever you want it for, it puts the response in the array you can call it out later for whatever.
[16:15:01] <duch_kazatel> indexOf returnes the index of a substring
[16:15:12] <PenguinMan98> I gotta run
[16:15:16] <PenguinMan98> have fun kiddies!
[16:15:20] <duch_kazatel> enjoy cap’n
[16:15:33] <decx> Siecje $('input[id*=start_date]')
[16:15:40] <duch_kazatel> Siecje are you trying to find an input that contains a certain substring?
[16:15:54] <Siecje> duch_kazatel: yes
[16:16:19] <duch_kazatel> that’s different from your original question - that explains it.  chekc out decx’s solution.
[16:17:39] <decx> * is contains, $ is ends with, ^ is starts with
[16:17:57] <decx> no idea what ~ does exactly
[16:18:25] <decx> ah right got it
[16:19:02] <io_______> here is a simplyfied version
[16:19:04] <io_______> http://codepad.org/DhbRamRb
[16:19:26] <hagar_> Hello! Is it a good practice using declaring event variables outside an event? Example: http://jsfiddle.net/mKs9r/ I know jQuery has good caching system and garbage collection works fine in modern browsers, but I think it's not good allocating memory all the time when an event is fired even if the variable has destroyed. Any thoughts about that?
[16:20:00] <duch_kazatel> hagar_ it very much depends on your use case.
[16:20:12] <duch_kazatel> jquery doesn’t control that caching, however.  javascript, does.
[16:20:44] <hagar_> from IE8+, if im right
[16:21:08] <duch_kazatel> jquery is just a library, nothing more.  javascript is what you’re thinking of.
[16:21:30] <duch_kazatel> either wya, if what you’re asking is a general “should i declare vars outside of events” - the answer is “it depends on what scope the var needs to be in”
[16:22:08] <shoky> and having it outside means that in the end it's not freed. at least not automatically
[16:22:27] <duch_kazatel> exactly.  having it outside makes it available to everything contained within that scope.
[16:22:33] <shoky> if you don't need it outside, leave it inside.
[16:22:44] <duch_kazatel> scope vars as deep as you can.
[16:22:46] <shoky> if you care about IE7, stop talking
[16:22:47] <duch_kazatel> avoid globals.
[16:22:48] <duch_kazatel> etc.
[16:23:20] <hagar_> ah, ok
[16:23:50] <hagar_> even if I use namespacing and initialization pattern to protect globals?
[16:24:05] <shoky> don't optimize something on a hunch
[16:24:19] <shoky> especially when that hunch has no real basis
[16:24:36] <shoky> leaving it inside is more readable and compact
[16:24:49] <duch_kazatel> hagar_ huh?  a global is a global.  what “initialization pattern” are you talking about?
[16:25:17] <hagar_> global is global but i still can wrap it
[16:25:20] <hagar_> in an object
[16:25:42] <shoky> you're still polluting a scope
[16:25:52] <shoky> doesn't matter if it's the most global one or not
[16:25:56] <duch_kazatel> bingo.
[16:26:04] <duch_kazatel> declare down into the function.
[16:26:26] <hagar_> <shoky> and having it outside means that in the end it's not freed. at least not automatically
[16:26:28] <hagar_> why not?
[16:26:49] <hagar_> it will be free as other vars at the end
[16:26:52] <hagar_> if nothing uses them
[16:26:53] <shoky> i just mean the last value isn't freed
[16:26:54] <hagar_> i think
[16:26:56] <shoky> not all the intermin ones
[16:27:02] <shoky> interim*
[16:28:41] <hagar_> well, ty for ur help guys :) it meant a lot
[16:30:43] <duch_kazatel> of course
[16:47:06] <nhulea> hey I am loading this html file via ajax and I was wondering if there is a better way to do this it works but it seems like there could be a better way to load <script>
[16:47:26] <Tjololo12> How about this? Is there a way to consolidate my localstorage? IE store a value under a different origin?
[16:47:28] <nhulea> here it is http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/rqtCf/
[16:48:13] <duch_kazatel> Tjololo12 nope.
[16:48:23] <Tjololo12> dammit, figures
[16:48:37] <duch_kazatel> nhulea yeah, you can set a datatype for javascript.
[16:48:44] <duch_kazatel> nhulea go check out the API docs for $.ajax()
[16:48:53] <duch_kazatel> Tjololo12 at least, i’m pretty sure.  same origin and all that.
[16:49:06] <Tjololo12> Yeah, that's what I'm seeing too, just wanted to verify.
[16:53:14] <nhulea> duch_kazatel: right but not paperscript but I could load it as html and then the rest as script in one ajax call that would prob work I think
[16:54:09] <duch_kazatel> nhulea i sent you a link earlier that mentioned using some method in paperscript to load stuff didn’t i?
[16:55:21] <nhulea> duch_kazatel: yeah it was my exact issue but it helped that was about loading the library
[16:55:50] <nhulea> plus in that example the canvas and paperscript were already on the page
[17:18:37] <Guest55939> Does anyone know how MySQLi works with JQuery's AutoComplete? I've been looking around but can't seem to understand it.
[17:20:39] <duch_kazatel> anybody remember that dude who was in here complaining about the docs for .data() being wrong?
[17:29:51] <fedya_> I've built a bunch of functionality for manipulating a data table, and the code has become somewhat of a mess, I'm hoping to refactor it, but am stuck as to what design patterns to use to bind some code to a table and handle events arising from clicks or tabbing through the editable cells. Any suggestions?
[18:11:55] <Fr0n> so silent here
[18:56:40] <cfoch> Hello. How can I get the 'object' of an object  which I am dragging ($(...).on("dragover", ...)? (draggable="true") ?
[19:34:16] <intermission1> Can anyone show me how to toggle the navbar icon in this fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/G34jD/8/
[19:53:08] <intermission1> #jquery is taking a siesta
[20:08:25] <mfoxdogg|work> hey all, is there a way to wait until $form.submit() is done, an event handler would be nice :)
[20:12:49] <cusco> mfoxdogg|work: I guess .done()
[20:12:51] <cusco> not sure
[20:13:15] <Velveeta> are you sending your form data via an $.ajax call?
[20:13:17] <cusco> bind('ajax:complete', function() {}
[20:13:25] <cusco> in the form
[20:15:35] <mfoxdogg|work> nevermind, just just a little delay, and no i wasn't doing an ajax call just using jquery's .submitt() function
[20:16:20] <Velveeta> that'll just fire a standard form post, which reloads the page.. so technically, your 'done' handler would be document.ready :D
[20:16:29] <Velveeta> fires*
[20:24:17] <mfoxdogg|work> Velveeta, thats problem, this didn't so i have to fire the refrsh by hand, but doing it straight after the submit it doesn't do the submit and just reloads the page
[20:25:01] <Velveeta> sounds like something was preventing the default action somewhere then
[21:31:40] <vinex08> are there any sites similar to try.jquery??  i have already completed the free course. :)  i want moar
[21:32:09] <vinex08> or may be you can give me some mini challenge, just something to work with...
[22:33:15] <hesco> I have some jquery code which works fine under manual exploratory testing, all built on this selector:  $('#list_options [type=radio]:not(:checked)').change();  However, when I drop the exact same markup into the qunit-fixture div of the qunit template, none of the [form_class].show() and .hide() stuff works and the unit tests written to exercise them (with .is(':visible')) mostly all fail (to be expected).  Any ideas what I'm missing he
[22:33:17] <hesco> re, please?
[22:35:16] <duch_kazatel> hesco have some sample code?
[22:37:12] <duch_kazatel> hesco because that selector is really inefficient and seems wrong to me.
[22:44:21] <Tomashe> Hey guys . im using jquery mobile. wondering if there is any way to start filter my results while im writing into input text , like teh way search work on mobiles
[22:44:50] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe you mean like google’s instant results thing?
[23:11:52] <Tomashe> es
[23:11:57] <Tomashe> duch_kazatel : yes
[23:12:48] <duch_kazatel> if you’re doing it with data all ready there, i’m sure somebody’s written a plugin to do it.
[23:13:53] <duch_kazatel> if not, you might have to do some extra legwork, but it should be fairly trivial.
[23:24:51] <Tomashe> yes the data is tehre
[23:33:14] <fattest> how do i make the play button to a pause button on default load? http://jsfiddle.net/rWMKK/17/
[23:36:52] <vinex08> are there any sites similar to try.jquery??  i have already completed the free course. :)  i want moar
[23:36:54] <vinex08> or may be you can give me some mini challenge, just something to work with...
[23:36:55] <Cork> fattest: http://jsfiddle.net/rWMKK/19/ ?
[23:37:16] <fattest> Cork: thank you so much!
[23:39:44] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/U7Vfz/
[23:39:56] <Tomashe> what im doing wrong here thats the css is not applied
[23:41:19] <fattest> Cork: do you think this is a good audio player for my website? http://jsfiddle.net/yTQUR/5/
[23:41:36] <fattest> Cork: except the buttons will be http://jsfiddle.net/rWMKK/19/ only
[23:42:52] <Cork> fattest: can't comment on that as i don't know what it uses
[23:43:06] <Cork> or what the browser compatibility is
[23:43:36] <Cork> though from a quick look it looks like it uses the audio api instead of <audio> tags
[23:43:50] <Cork> and that isn't supper compatible with browsers
[23:44:31] <fattest> Cork: do you recommend any tutorials that i should follow?
[23:44:38] <Cork> Tomashe: i would prob recommend using .filter instead of contains
[23:44:45] <Cork> fattest: nope
[23:44:59] <Cork> Tomashe: also i recommend using classes instead of inline css
[23:45:03] <Cork> much easier to manage
[23:45:30] <Tomashe> im using classes its just for testing
[23:45:40] <Tomashe> when i do
[23:45:41] <Tomashe> var mytext    = object.text();
[23:45:42] <Tomashe> i get nothing
[23:45:43] <Cork> basically js should never contain css unless the css needs to be dynamically changed (like ex. color animation)
[23:46:34] <compact> hey, ive got a form i want, and depending on an option, will change the fields in the form. now the only issue i have, if i have say <texta> at the top, then use jquery to hide <texta> down further (dont want to fill that out), how can i stop the second <texta> creating the value to null?
[23:46:36] <Tomashe> im getting error on that line : console.log(mytext);
[23:49:31] <Cork> Tomashe: http://jsfiddle.net/U7Vfz/1/
[23:51:45] <Tomashe> is that even legit : $( elval, ":contains('" + text + "')").css( "text-decoration", "underline" );
[23:52:08] <Tomashe> let me se
[23:53:47] <Cork> Tomashe: elval should be after the selector
[23:53:53] <Cork> not before
[23:54:04] <Cork> but ya, it is still not a good selector
[23:56:30] <Tomashe> hmm wierd
[23:56:33] <Tomashe> your way isnt working
[23:56:39] <Tomashe> its not addin the mark
[23:58:15] <Cork> Tomashe: then please make a working demo
[23:58:22] <fattest> Cork: i got the basic idea of audio player. How do i make my pause and play buttons work now? if i add audio.stop() or .play() it doesn't work. http://jsfiddle.net/rWMKK/24/ my attempt: http://jsfiddle.net/rWMKK/26/
[23:58:30] <Cork> i could just guess at what you where trying to do
[23:58:56] <Tomashe> i have a container full of divs with class "services-t" i want to search in them
[23:59:07] <Tomashe> and if there is a match add this class "mark" to it
