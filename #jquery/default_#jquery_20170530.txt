[03:22:38] <toomin> Hey
[03:22:52] <toomin> I have a problem with jquery datepicker.
[03:23:33] <toomin> For certain screen width-height ratio, there is a pretty noticeable gap between the date input, and the calendar which appears on clicking the date input.
[03:51:03] <nimoot> Here's a screenshot of the datepicker at different screen widths: http://i.imgur.com/i9OD8VE.png
[05:17:31] <Kingsy> what is the easiest way of replacing all classnames containing [x] with [someVariable] on all children of a given element?
[05:17:35] <Kingsy> cant find a good solution
[05:24:16] <FilipNortic> Kingsy: you cant do it without an each statment
[05:24:30] <FilipNortic> what does containing x mean?
[05:29:24] <FilipNortic> or I'm sure it can be done but i doubt there is anything easier than an each statment or somthing eqivalent
[05:55:39] <Kingsy> FilipNortic: ah ok
[07:14:29] <Cork> Kingsy: parent.find('.className').removeClass('className').addClass(variable)
[07:15:08] <Cork> Kingsy: if you have compound classnames that is something you should try to avoid as the dom don't have any good way to handle them (and it isn't how classes are meant to be used)
[08:09:19] <rjCousineau> My el's ID is <div id="seriouly, this"></div>  but $('#seriously, this') don't work!!  ok i'm just kidding i don't have this problem, but the id is legal!
[08:14:31] <pavonia> $('[id="seriously, this"]') for the rescue
[08:14:59] <aruns> ^
[08:22:17] <toomin> http://i.imgur.com/i9OD8VE.png <-- gap between datepicker input and calendar.
[08:22:38] <toomin> It happens only for certain height to width ratios.
[08:22:53] <toomin> How do I fix it?
[09:19:51] <Cork> rjCousineau: $('#seriouly\,\ this') will select that id
[09:20:04] <Cork> opps forgot the double escape
[09:20:10] <Cork> rjCousineau: $('#seriouly\\,\\ this') will select that id
[09:21:06] <Cork> toomin: you would have to provide an either jsfiddle example or a link for anyone to be able to answer that
[09:21:27] <Cork> toomin: but the developer tools and inspecting where the margin comes from is the solution
[09:21:40] <Cork> (could be a clear: both; for example)
[10:44:57] <toomin> Thanks, Cork. Not using "clear: both". I'll break my head over it for a while.
[10:45:22] <toomin> uploading a fiddle won't be easy. I'll see what I can do.
[10:46:39] <Uhkis> toomin: what is that picker?
[11:02:56] <toomin> jquery ui datepicker, Uhkis.
[11:28:05] <z1haze> I am taking a response from an ajax request (which is just html) and doing a $(response).insertAfter('.some-class').animate({height: 'toggle', opacity: 'toggle'}, 'fast') but for some reason a display:none style is getting added inline. is this default behavior of animate toggle or something?
[13:14:22] <MACscr> whats the proper way to get a file from a form? I have a perfectly good form that I am trying to ajaxify. lol. Doing it to a standard form is easy, but ive never tried with file uploads. Advice? https://jsfiddle.net/9esvyhmL/
[13:14:39] <MACscr> im trying to keep it as simple as possible without bringing in any plugins, etc
[13:14:50] <taplar> the input type="file" elements have a 'files' property on them
[13:15:04] <robertmaxrees> http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/uploading-files-ajax
[13:15:10] <taplar> you can get those to put in a FormData to send on the ajax request
[13:15:39] <MACscr> taplar right, i thought $('input[type=file]').prop('files')[0] would do that
[13:15:59] <taplar> that gets the file, if there is one, yep
[13:16:39] <MACscr> ok, so can i not pass that to my form processor like normal as im doing in my fiddle?
[13:16:50] <taplar> look at roberts link
[13:17:17] <taplar> FormData is a specific type of object
[13:19:46] <MACscr> that blog article seems to add complexity that i dont think is really needed, but i could easily be wrong
[13:20:40] <taplar> depends on what you are considering complexity, but `var formData = new FormData();` is required, unless you upload in another manner
[13:21:05] <taplar> *afaik
[13:22:55] <MACscr> taplar so the formData object i created isnt good enough?
[13:23:09] <taplar> it's not a FormData.  it's an object
[13:23:24] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:23:57] <robertmaxrees> you have an object named "formData" - the article i linked talks about how you create an "actual" formdata object.
[13:29:34] <MACscr> got it working. thanks guys

[15:39:31] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeee
[16:58:28] <lamalex> Hi! I’ve got this little snippet —> https://paste2.org/cJjww4Yj  When I $.addClass(‘showing’) nothing happens, but I change showing to not cascade from .sidebar it works fine. Is there some special syntax for .addClass I need to use to tell it I mean .sidebar .showing?
[16:59:18] <robertmaxrees> lamalex you're telling it to add that class to #budget-sidebar
[16:59:33] <robertmaxrees> and your css says .sidebar .showing - that's a descendent selector.
[16:59:44] <robertmaxrees> the css is looking for all elements with .showing under .sidebar.
[17:00:22] <robertmaxrees> lamalex are you intending to add that class to #budget-sidebar ?
[17:00:30] <lamalex> robertmaxrees: yes
[17:00:42] <robertmaxrees> then your css for .sidebar .showing { is wrong.
[17:00:59] <robertmaxrees> just remove the space between them - .sidebar.showing {
[17:01:46] <robertmaxrees> brb
[17:01:50] <lamalex> robertmaxrees: hah. :\ thank you
[17:02:38] <duch_kazatel> back
[17:03:11] <robertmaxrees> lamalex confused by something?
[17:03:28] <lamalex> robertmaxrees: no im just a dummy for missing that space!
[17:03:34] <robertmaxrees> hah
[17:03:35] <robertmaxrees> fair enough
