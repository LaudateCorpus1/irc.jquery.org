[07:54:39] <dimi1947> is it possible to create custom animations for jquery dialogUI by using css3?
[08:14:19] <Cork> dimi1947: jquery ui doesn't use keyframe so possibly as long as you don't use jquery-uis animation
[08:14:49] <Cork> if you already use jquery ui animation it will most likely be hard
[08:27:20] <dimi1947> so If I want to make a really fance dialog animation shoud check elsewhere
[08:28:06] <dimi1947> fance==fancy
[08:32:48] <Cork> dimi1947: they have a lot of animations in jquery-ui so no that isn't at all what i'n saying
[08:32:59] <Cork> but those animations is thoruhg .animate() not keyframe
[08:33:36] <dimi1947> ok
[13:49:52] <ace_me> With  {{ encore_entry_script_tags('main') }} https://pastebin.com/XgHDmDiE I get Bootstrap's JavaScript requires jQuery
[13:50:58] <robertmaxrees> ace_me are you getting any errors?
[13:51:38] <robertmaxrees> before that one, i mean.
[13:52:48] <ace_me> nope robertmaxrees
[13:54:21] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.  hard to say weithout seeing if there's a pathing issue or anything like that.
[13:56:45] <ace_me> not looking as a path issue... single file with a 403 is a google ads
[13:57:42] <robertmaxrees> ace_me using a bundler or anything like that?
[13:58:09] <ace_me> are you familiar with symfony encore .. it uses webpack
[13:58:19] <robertmaxrees> nope.,
[13:58:54] <ace_me> I do a yarn build
[13:59:17] <ace_me> which seems to correctly add css files ... but js is death somehow
[13:59:26] <robertmaxrees> dunno tbh.

[14:00:12] <robertmaxrees> i'm not gonna learn symfony for this haha
[14:00:17] <ace_me> no need to read ... i will do it on my own.
[14:00:38] <ace_me> :) just want you to let you know if eventually wanna read sometime in the far future :)
