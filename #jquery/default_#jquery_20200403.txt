[11:57:13] <kara_mahdiar> hello, this code cant be run
[11:57:15] <kara_mahdiar> https://dpaste.org/P6Z9
[11:57:21] <kara_mahdiar> thank you
[14:58:45] <Sal> hi, can someone help me on this: https://jsbin.com/zaxikipaha/edit?html,css,js,output
[14:59:21] <Sal> when i click on Text One it slides down its child, but when i click on text one-one, it doesn, but closes it all
[14:59:44] <Sal> I know I'm doing something wrong in jquery, but it shoudl pick the right child
[15:00:40] <Sal> doesn't $parent.find('>.child') get only the first nearest child?
[15:06:00] <thykka> Sal, checking..
[15:07:21] <Sal> thanks
[15:07:51] <Sal> I think its the ow-event
[15:07:57] <Sal> right?
[15:09:29] <Sal> no
[15:09:35] <thykka> jsbin isn't working for me, won't let me edit :I
[15:10:28] <Sal> https://jsbin.com/zaxikipaha/edit?html,css,js,output
[15:10:41] <Sal> strange, the url says edit
[15:10:55] <Sal> put all on jsfiddle?
[15:11:46] <thykka> yeah
[15:11:53] <Sal> ok, gimme 2 secs, wait
[15:11:58] <thykka> your event handler seems to be getting triggered multiple times
[15:12:47] <thykka> Sal, https://jsfiddle.net/t4zudq2e/
[15:13:39] <Sal> https://jsfiddle.net/8bkrzL6c/
[15:13:45] <Sal> oh, you already did it?
[15:13:47] <Sal> let me see
[15:14:19] <Sal> damn! it works
[15:14:22] <Sal> what did you change
[15:14:28] <thykka> you have .ow-event-accordion-item elements inside .ow-event-accordion-item elements, and the event bubbles up through each of them
[15:14:40] <thykka> adding event.stopPropagation() stops this from happening
[15:14:58] <thykka> ...where "event" is the first parameter for the event handler function
[15:15:00] <Sal> great! didn't think about that... hehehe I have it all over my code, but I forgot it here
[15:15:06] <Sal> thanks
[15:15:09] <thykka> np!
[15:16:04] <Sal> oh, but i have to leave the eq(0)
[15:16:06] <Sal> hmmm
[15:16:49] <Sal> ok
[17:09:07] <Northwoods> How can i encapsulate this code into function so taht it can be used in multiple element ( rows ) in a table
