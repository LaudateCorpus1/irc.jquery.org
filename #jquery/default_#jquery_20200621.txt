[20:14:52] <jak2000> hi all, 2 questions, how to validate if the typed number in price column is valid decimal number:  /msg NickServ identify
[20:15:02] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/ep7nxkvt/5/
[21:34:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[21:34:56] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 like 90% of that fiddle has nothing to do with your question ;)
[21:36:20] <robertmaxrees> either way, just make the input a type="number" and you're good to go.
[21:49:25] <jak2000> robertmaxrees yes why not? the problem is.... i use a table edit plugin...
[21:50:00] <robertmaxrees> what's the name of the plugin?
[21:50:52] <robertmaxrees> is it https://markcell.github.io/jquery-tabledit/#documentation jak2000
[21:52:05] <robertmaxrees> because if so, i'd ditch it and roll your own.  that's an ancient plugin and what you're trying to do is pretty simple./
[22:22:45] <jak2000> why simple?
[22:22:49] <jak2000> explain me more please
[22:24:09] <robertmaxrees> looks like the plugin gives you a button to edit a field, save it, or delete, no?
[22:24:18] <robertmaxrees> and then sends that to your server via ajax?
[22:28:39] <robertmaxrees> either way, my main point is if you just use <input type="number">, you'll get what you want.  alternatively, you can do something like if (Number(theInputValue)) { and get something simular.
[22:28:55] <robertmaxrees> *similar.  though you want to prevent people from entering non-numeric values from the get-go.
[22:49:34] <jak2000> robertmaxrees i understand but in which event i evaluate? and 2 wich other plugin recommmend me? thanks
