[00:00:35] <d3m0n> Cork, around? He usually points me in the right direction.
[00:01:00] <grodt> hes eating breakfast
[00:01:16] <grodt> Cork, ping
[00:01:36] <SlexAxton> d3m0n: you can't reach into the contents of a 3rd party iframe
[00:01:41] <SlexAxton> in any situation
[00:01:56] <d3m0n> SlexAxton: Only for local?
[00:02:05] <SlexAxton> a frame must be the 'same origin' in order to be accessible
[00:02:20] <d3m0n> Is that true for all modern browers?
[00:02:21] <grodt> d3m0n, sheesh, didnt I tell you what SlexAxton said?
[00:02:28] <SlexAxton> if you own both frames, then you can set up a 'postMessage' channel between them
[00:02:55] <SlexAxton> grodt it's not surprising that someone would ignore you, please be a little friendlier in here
[00:03:06] <d3m0n> Well, atm I have my testcase working locally but only on Firefox. I am curious if the other browers don't even allow local cross origin.
[00:03:21] <SlexAxton> not even firefox allows it
[00:03:26] <d3m0n> I didn't ignore him, he just doesn't know what he's talking about.
[00:03:33] <SlexAxton> if it works locally, the two domains must be the same
[00:03:34] <d3m0n> I mean only Local SlexAxton
[00:03:47] <grodt> d3m0n, lol I said the same thing SlexAxton said
[00:03:48] <d3m0n> It works locally for Firefox, not working locally for webkit
[00:04:03] <d3m0n> <grodt> you have no #lipsum in your HTML so how is it supposed to prepend to it son?
[00:04:12] <grodt> d3m0n, read the next reply
[00:04:24] <d3m0n> <grodt> d3m0n, i dont think you can mess with the iframes content
[00:04:31] <d3m0n> which, yes, yes you can mess with iframes content
[00:04:31] <SlexAxton> 'local' doesn't factor into this, only the domains used to load them with
[00:05:05] <d3m0n> Ok, pages being loaded on the same domain work for firefox, not webkit
[00:05:14] <cyberbrai> woet will you do in my fiddle 	http://jsfiddle.net/jedyjy5n/
[00:05:37] <SlexAxton> d3m0n: perhaps you have some other bug, but many many sites rely on that working in webkit
[00:06:01] <d3m0n> Ok thanks SlexAxton
[00:06:11] <SlexAxton> 'that' being 'local iframe access'
[00:06:28] <d3m0n> Yep, gotcha
[00:06:32] <SlexAxton> the reason it might not work on webkit is because the iframe hasn't loaded yet
[00:06:59] <SlexAxton> if you try to reach into the contents of an iframe that hasn't loaded, you won't find much
[00:07:09] <SlexAxton> you can wait for the `load` event of the iframe though
[00:08:05] <SlexAxton> also, you should keep your devtools open
[00:08:15] <SlexAxton> there's a pretty clear warning about the cross domain thing
[00:08:15] <SlexAxton> http://slex.me/image/1m433C1C3z1G
[00:09:10] <cyberbrai> Woet i change the selector but it's not work
[00:09:31] <SlexAxton> i'm gonna head off, thanks to both of you for keeping this a friendly place to be
[00:10:51] <Cork> hmm?
[00:11:23] <cyberbrai> $(this).find('li').length;
[00:11:27] <cyberbrai> work
[00:11:56] <Cork> ppl are up early today >_>
[00:21:46] <d3m0n> It's 2pm for me Cork :P
[00:22:09] <Cork> either way it is usually quite this time a day
[00:22:20] <Cork> what ever time it is for you :)
[00:23:02] <midori-rus> How to bind onclick data attribute if it was changed in ajax success function?
[00:23:25] <grodt> hey Cork!!
[00:23:52] <Cork> midori-rus: what do you mean data attibute?
[00:24:22] <midori-rus> Cork we talked about it at last friday :(
[00:24:25] <cyberbrai> 								$("#cart ol:first").find("#image").prop('id', "image"+subIndex).removeClass("blackboxVoicemail").addClass("blackboxbig-Voicemail").css({ margin: 2px -98px });;
[00:24:35] <midori-rus> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/symbios/nbr3svz8/
[00:24:56] <cyberbrai> css({ margin: 2px -98px }); it is aright way to do iit
[00:25:06] <Cork> midori-rus: you never made any sense in what you mean
[00:25:12] <Cork> what is the problem?
[00:25:17] <midori-rus> Cork $(el).attr('data-action', "add"); changes data-action from del to add. But if I click the element ajax sends del :(
[00:25:24] <Cork> ah
[00:25:26] <Cork> now i see
[00:25:34] <Cork> midori-rus: use .data('action') not .attr
[00:25:42] <Cork> midori-rus: .data caches the data from the dom
[00:25:52] <Cork> so if you later change it with .attr again it won't catch that
[00:25:59] <midori-rus> Cork I tried, but it doesnt change attr
[00:26:47] <Cork> midori-rus: yes, i just said so >_>
[00:26:57] <Cork> .data updates the cache that .data uses
[00:27:22] <Cork> when you run .data and the key you ask for doesn't exist in the cache it looks at the attribute and then puts the value in cache
[00:27:31] <Cork> it never touches the attributes after that
[00:28:56] <midori-rus> Cork $(el).data("action", "add"); doesnt change data attr. I dont understand how to change it
[00:29:10] <Cork> midori-rus: why do you need to touch the attribute?
[00:29:22] <Cork> why does it matter to you?
[00:30:20] <midori-rus> I want to make button which adds item to favorite. And it have to toogle add/del after click http://joxi.ru/D2PBZLysllV0r3
[00:30:39] <Cork> sure, but why does this have to be done on the actual attribute?
[00:30:54] <Cork> isn't that .data('object-action') is modified enough?
[00:31:07] <Cork> sory
[00:31:11] <Cork> .data('action')
[00:31:20] <midori-rus> Cork coz I send action: action in Ajax
[00:31:31] <Cork> you send .data('action'
[00:31:40] <Cork> not attr('data-action')
[00:31:48] <Cork> so, no that part doesn't care
[00:31:58] <Cork> so again, why does the attribute value matteR?
[00:32:17] <midori-rus> Cork object action is about object like sale, rent
[00:32:25] <Cork> ya, i corrected that
[00:32:57] <midori-rus> Cork it is impossible to fix?
[00:33:07] <Cork> i don't understand what you need to fix
[00:34:01] <midori-rus> Cork imagine please. I click to add button and ajax sends request. In request ID, and action like ADD
[00:34:31] <Cork> midori-rus: this might explain it http://jsfiddle.net/ym1azzoL/
[00:34:34] <midori-rus> Cork after that you click this button second time. There is a second request which sends ID and DEL
[00:34:36] <Cork> you don't care about what is in attr
[00:34:45] <Cork> you care about data('action')
[00:34:55] <Cork> so just modify .data('action') and things will work just fine
[00:35:07] <Cork> attr is the original stale html data-action
[00:35:12] <Cork> you don't need it
[00:35:24] <Cork> its there to initialize the .data cache, after that you don't need it
[00:35:33] <midori-rus> Cork $(el).data("action", "add"); not works
[00:35:44] <Cork> midori-rus: could you make a demo?
[00:35:49] <Cork> it should work just fine
[00:37:17] <midori-rus> Cork ok
[00:47:04] <midori-rus> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/symbios/nbr3svz8/4/
[00:47:08] <midori-rus> the example
[00:48:15] <midori-rus> lol, it works here
[00:48:16] <Cork> except you didn't do the change we talked about http://jsfiddle.net/nbr3svz8/6/
[00:48:50] <Cork> again; the attr('action') value is expected to not change
[00:50:54] <midori-rus> I wasted about 1 day to fix it. T_T
[00:53:55] <cyberbrai> $("#sur ol:first").find("#image").prop('id', "image"+subIndex).removeClass("blackbox").addClass("blackboxbig").css({ "margin": "2px -98px" });
[00:54:16] <Cork> cyberbrai: if you have a question you need to ask it
[00:54:22] <cyberbrai> yup
[00:54:26] <Cork> throwing random code lines in the channel won't work
[00:55:34] <cyberbrai> i have a an image blackboxbig and i want to append some css property
[00:56:25] <Cork> cyberbrai:  $("#sur ol:first").find("#image") <-- this line can be simplified to  $("#image")
[00:56:44] <cyberbrai> wait
[00:57:08] <midori-rus> Cork are you boss here?
[00:57:19] <Cork> boss?
[00:57:24] <midori-rus> Cork thank you for your help
[00:57:28] <Cork> np
[01:14:53] <cyberbrai> Cork sorry for logout dude  that's my fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/bvf9u/279/ i want to know how can i add the css properties to existing class
[01:15:20] <Cork> cyberbrai: you really, really shouldn't do that
[01:15:31] <cyberbrai> Cork why
[01:15:35] <Cork> cyberbrai: you can do it by modifying the rule in document.styleSheets
[01:15:44] <Cork> but each change cause a full page reflow
[01:16:02] <Cork> so it is very costly (as the browser has to recalculate everything on the page)
[01:16:19] <cyberbrai> cork i don't want to change the full page flow
[01:16:36] <Cork> if you want to modify the properties of a css rule, you are
[01:17:01] <cyberbrai> so instead of modifywhat to do
[01:17:06] <Cork> cyberbrai: best option is to just have an extra class
[01:17:14] <Cork> that sets the padding
[01:17:57] <Cork> cyberbrai: http://jsfiddle.net/bvf9u/280/
[01:19:32] <cyberbrai> ok lets try this one give me one min
[01:38:00] <grodt> Cork, where did you go
[01:38:02] <grodt> for that long
[01:38:23] <Cork> ?
[01:45:20] <grodt> Cork, you had a long breakfast
[01:45:46] <Cork> you said i had a breakfast i didn't
[01:50:30] <Omar-> good morning
[01:54:01] <grodt> Omar-, haram zada namaste
[01:55:04] <Omar-> grodt, hmmm i dont speak that language ;)
[01:55:34] <grodt> Omar-, Airy Fic
[01:55:45] <grodt> Omar-, Kaifa Haluka
[01:55:46] <Omar-> laish?
[01:55:55] <Omar-> 3eeb 3aleek
[01:55:59] <grodt> Omar-, Khaneeth Kis em ick
[01:56:04] <Omar-> airy feek
[01:56:11] <Omar-> kos em abook ya manyak
[01:56:13] <grodt> Omar-, Kool Khara jquery Khaneeth
[01:56:26] <Omar-> ta3al mos airy
[01:56:38] <grodt> Omar-, why did you just call me gay
[01:56:43] <grodt> wtf
[01:56:54] <Omar-> because you're manyak
[01:57:08] <Omar-> bet7eb tentak kaman
[01:57:08] <Cork> uh, guys...?
[01:57:25] <Cork> is this really something you need to do in the channel?
[01:57:34] <grodt> Cork, if your asking, yes
[01:57:58] <Omar-> ignore him Cork
[01:57:59] <Cork> and in what way do you think the other 679 users in here care about this?
[01:58:07] <Omar-> he's an ****** racist
[01:58:13] <Cork> Omar-: drop it
[02:14:07] <Omar-> what's the best way of attaching multiple events to dynamically created elements? this code (http://pastebin.com/sze6SWiB) will be attached to one or more same "class" in document
[02:14:40] <Cork> Omar-: delegation is still the best solution
[02:15:22] <Omar-> Cork: if I want to wrap the code in IIFE would I still need to delegate?
[02:15:37] <Cork> iife?
[02:15:44] <Omar-> yea
[02:16:19] <Cork> ah, first time i've heard that term for it
[02:16:21] <Omar-> (function ($) { "use strict" etc... }(jQuery);
[02:16:28] <Omar-> ?g iife
[02:16:29] <b-ot> Omar-: Ben Alman » Immediately-Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) → http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[02:16:32] <Cork> Omar-: don't see how that would matter
[02:17:08] <Cork> (it's normally just referred to as "scope"
[02:17:09] <Cork> )
[02:17:37] <Omar-> would be matter if I wrap code in "scope"?
[02:17:43] <Omar-> or the result would be the same?
[02:18:01] <Cork> depends on what you need to scope
[02:18:06] <Cork> but generally, no it shouldn't matter
[02:36:36] <Omar-> thanks Cork. in that case, I should bind events to document or is it better to bind it static parent?
[02:37:10] <Cork> Omar-: it is normally good to isolate them to the relevant section
[02:37:13] <Omar-> performance wise. The code is meant to work on handheld/touch devices
[02:37:37] <Cork> Omar-: the number of event handlers you bind matter not so much where you bind them
[02:45:54] <Omar-> Cork I'll bind 4 events as in the fiddle
[02:46:10] <Omar-> not more
[02:46:13] <Cork> Omar-: no you bind 4 events * number of elements
[02:46:23] <Cork> that is why i suggested delegation
[02:46:33] <Omar-> Cork yea, that in case I dont delegate
[02:56:01] <d3m0n> Does animation not work with 100% width?
[03:02:27] <Cork> d3m0n: it does
[03:02:33] <Cork> it doesn't work with width: auto though
[03:02:47] <Cork> if you mean css3 animation
[03:02:58] <d3m0n> hrmm, I am using 100% width animation and it just shoots to 100% without animation
[03:03:20] <Cork> is this css or jquery animation?
[03:03:40] <d3m0n> jquery
[03:03:51] <Cork> set overflow: hidden; on the element
[03:04:12] <Cork> you child elements are overflowing the element you animate
[03:04:16] <Cork> so you don't get the animation
[03:06:13] <d3m0n> Hrmm well it's an iframe so nothing can really overflow?
[03:06:24] <d3m0n> So weird it was just animating before I have to relook why it's not anymore
[03:06:37] <d3m0n> I think it had to do with the parent having a set width and now it doesnt
[03:07:16] <jeanre> Hi all
[03:07:21] <jeanre> working with jquery drag and drop
[03:07:25] <jeanre> but have some issues
[03:07:44] <jeanre> using a thumbnail that gets dragged, on drop it needs to use a bigger image and be resizable
[03:12:07] <esko> Has anyone preloaded values into selectize.js when using ajax here?
[03:16:06] <d3m0n> So Cork, when I have max-width on the element I am animating. It doesn't look like it works properly.
[03:16:43] <d3m0n> So, I have max-width: 800px on the element I am animating. It starts out as, say, 300px and animated to 100% (800px). It won't animate that properly.
[03:18:16] <Mirozh> hello
[03:18:23] <Mirozh> (bonjour)
[03:20:16] <Mirozh> When we use a function evnt like $(element).click(function(){}), can we use a function we declared ? like $(element).click(myFunction()) ? Because when i try to do this, with the Event param, it doesn't work cause the Event is not defined.
[03:24:08] <d3m0n> Mirozh: I believe it would be $(element).click(function(){ myFunction(); });
[03:24:58] <Mirozh> Yes, i though we can also call our own function but apparently there is only one way
[03:25:21] <d3m0n> Mirozh: That function is for passing values
[03:25:29] <d3m0n> Or so I believe
[03:32:10] <negev> so i've got this div, which when expanded via some jquery plugin, has weird grey lines as artefacts around it: http://a.rkw.me/css1.png http://a.rkw.me/css2.png
[03:32:15] <negev> only happens in safari on yosemite and i can't see anything in the dom that would explain the lines
[03:32:18] <negev> anyone seen this before?
[03:33:43] <Saberu> how do i force ajax to use SSL? adding https in the location string isnt doing it
[03:37:22] <Cork> Saberu: uh, that would only happen if the server redirects https to http
[04:01:26] <kokut1> Hello, how do you call jquery without the $¿
[04:02:21] <kokut1> likenvm
[04:49:16] <kokut1> Hello, i need to change a propperty of an element, selecting by the first occurrence of a class in the DOM, how can i do it?
[04:49:33] <mbrzuzy> $('.class').first().prop()
[04:49:46] <mbrzuzy> $('.parent .class:first-child').prop()
[04:49:52] <mbrzuzy> etc
[04:50:17] <Cork> mbrzuzy: :first-child is not first occurrence in the dom
[04:50:23] <Cork> :first is though
[04:50:59] <mbrzuzy> Good catch, Cork
[04:52:25] <kokut1> why .parent?
[04:54:12] <Cork> kokut1: just an example css
[04:54:18] <Cork> *selector
[04:54:49] <Cork> kokut1: the point is: $('selector').first() or $('selector:first')
[05:03:48] <Omar-> if I place a photo in a hidden div (display: none) and attach "load" event, would the event emit when image is fully loaded?
[05:04:24] <Cork> Omar-: if you manage to attach the event on the image before it is fully loaded
[05:04:39] <Cork> Omar-: if the image is visible or not doesn't affect if it gets "fully loaded" or not
[05:04:55] <Cork> as soon as you create a dom element with the src reference the browser will start loading it
[05:05:01] <Omar-> Cork, great, this is what I wanted to know
[05:05:24] <Cork> meaning make sure you attach the event handler BEFORE you give it the url
[05:05:31] <Omar-> whether it's hidden it doesn't matter as long as "load" is attached to it
[05:05:35] <Cork> or you will lose the event if it is in cache
[05:05:37] <Omar-> yup
[05:05:51] <Omar-> images will be loaded via ajax call
[05:06:04] <Omar-> this leads to another question
[05:06:14] <Cork> Omar-: i meant this might be racy: $('<img>').attr('src', 'something').on('load', func)
[05:06:27] <Omar-> hmmmm
[05:06:29] <Cork> Omar-: while this isn't: $('<img>').on('load', func).attr('src', 'something')
[05:06:44] <Omar-> great point
[05:06:57] <Cork> Omar-: also images isn't normally loaded over ajax
[05:07:06] <Omar-> I meant the src
[05:07:13] <Omar-> links to images
[05:07:43] <Omar-> in that case, I'd need to attach "load" to each and every images independently
[05:08:07] <Cork> Omar-: the pages .load event doesn't fire before all images are loaded
[05:08:08] <Omar-> there might be one image or several ones in ajax response
[05:08:11] <cyberbrai> Cork : sorry for not responses  cork
[05:08:12] <Cork> so that is another way to do it
[05:08:48] <Omar-> Cork, i'll show you code I made long times back
[05:08:49] <Cork> that is just on the first initial load though
[05:08:49] <Omar-> just sec
[05:08:56] <cyberbrai> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/bvf9u/282/ here my fiddle and parent child relation
[05:09:17] <Cork> cyberbrai: i don't remember the question
[05:09:46] <cyberbrai> coek np cork actually i ask about how can i add the css class to li
[05:10:14] <Cork> ah now i remember the margin thing
[05:10:26] <cyberbrai> cork yes
[05:10:27] <Cork> cyberbrai: so what are you trying to manage?
[05:10:41] <krambiorix> hi , when using autocomplete: what's the difference between selecting an option with the TAB key and with mouse click?
[05:11:15] <Cork> cyberbrai: uh, btw i don't think div is valid inside ol elements
[05:11:18] <cyberbrai> cork i am using child class  for child element  i want as per as li append to parent i want to manage the margin dynamically
[05:11:34] <cyberbrai> cork why
[05:11:49] <cyberbrai> cork we can use the div anywhere i think
[05:12:04] <Cork> cyberbrai: let me verify it, but i think only li is valid inside <ul> and <ol>
[05:13:21] <Omar-> i couldn't find the code
[05:13:25] <cyberbrai> cork just for adjustment i am using the div
[05:13:27] <Cork> Element div not allowed as child of element ol in this context.
[05:13:42] <Cork> so no you can't have a div there
[05:13:47] <Cork> http://validator.w3.org/check
[05:13:52] <Cork> used: <!doctype html><html><head><title>.</title></head><body><ol><div><li></li></div></body></html>
[05:13:52] <Omar-> so you do recommend binding .load to wrapping div of all images
[05:14:09] <Cork> Omar-: not sure if load bubbles
[05:14:12] <Cork> i think it doesn't
[05:14:18] <cyberbrai> cork ok in future i am not using the div ol li
[05:14:30] <Omar-> i'll test it
[05:14:34] <Cork> cyberbrai: <div><ol><li> is find
[05:14:37] <Cork> *fine
[05:14:45] <Cork> <ol><div><li> isn't
[05:14:55] <Cork> and <ol><li><div> is fine too
[05:15:05] <cyberbrai> cork ok
[05:15:29] <Cork> so i would recommend fixing that
[05:15:37] <cyberbrai> wait a min
[05:15:39] <Cork> as you will get unreliable error corrections from the parser
[05:15:47] <Cork> so you aren't sure what dom you are really working with
[05:16:08] <cyberbrai> ok one thing i want to know li contain a div
[05:16:14] <cyberbrai> cork
[05:17:46] <cyberbrai> http://jsfiddle.net/bvf9u/283/ cork i thing it's fix
[05:18:08] <Cork> ya, that looks much better
[05:18:27] <Cork> so, what is the question now
[05:18:29] <Cork> ?
[05:19:20] <Omar-> Cork, true, it doesn't bubble http://jsfiddle.net/Lqhrz1pb/
[05:19:32] <Omar-> it should be directly attached to img element
[05:20:26] <Cork> Omar-: is these images inside the "original" html
[05:20:36] <Cork> meaning a full normal page load?
[05:21:48] <Omar-> no, the images will be loaded after page is shown
[05:21:58] <Omar-> or maybe before. I still didn't decide
[05:22:03] <Omar-> because I'm use jQM
[05:22:05] <Cork> ok, then ya, you need to attach an event to each image :/
[05:22:26] <Omar-> Multi-page model, which means all pages are in DOM
[05:22:49] <Cork> well if they are in dom that means they are in initial page load
[05:22:51] <cyberbrai> oook cork actually i want when i append the one more child in parent it's change the css class margin
[05:22:55] <Omar-> Cork any draw-back?
[05:23:10] <Cork> Omar-: not really, don't forget to remove the event handler
[05:23:32] <Cork> cyberbrai: what are you trying to do?
[05:23:40] <Omar-> Cork, once loaded? $("elm").on("load", foo).off("load");?
[05:23:49] <Cork> no
[05:23:57] <Cork> simplest is prob to use .one('load')
[05:24:07] <Omar-> Cork duh lol. true!
[05:24:15] <Cork> sorry its .once
[05:24:24] <Omar-> .one()
[05:24:29] <cyberbrai>  cork  as per as user add the child in parent i have to show in some sequences like a flow chart
[05:24:34] <Cork> $("elm").on("load", foo).off("load"); <-- this would basically be a no-op
[05:24:35] <Omar-> unless .once() is new
[05:24:41] <Cork> ?api one
[05:24:41] <b-ot> Cork: .one(): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[05:24:49] <Cork> ya, that is the one
[05:24:55] <Omar-> Cork ;)
[05:24:58] <Cork> i never remember if it is one or once
[05:25:01] <Omar-> haha
[05:25:03] <Cork> use it too little
[05:25:15] <Omar-> I use it more often
[05:25:24] <Omar-> especially in jQM
[05:25:32] <Cork> cyberbrai: you need to be less abstract if you want help
[05:25:49] <Omar-> since jQM pagecontainer events cant be delegated nor attached to a specific element
[05:26:41] <cyberbrai> something like tree structure
[05:28:35] <cyberbrai> cork orgchart
[05:57:47] <john-dev> does anyone know a plugin to create serverpath’s using ajax? i need to allow a user to import a file, that is already on the server
[06:05:26] <Cork> john-dev: create server path?
[06:05:42] <Cork> john-dev: you would have to have a server side implementation that does this either way
[06:05:55] <john-dev> Cork: that will be done using php..
[06:06:08] <john-dev> I just tried to avoid wrting my own script for the client-side
[06:06:20] <Cork> john-dev: you most likely have to
[06:06:29] <john-dev> ok :-)
[06:06:39] <Cork> also be careful for how you expose this
[06:06:57] <Cork> so you don't end up letting third parties create random things on the system
[06:07:06] <Cork> (specially filter for ../ and so on)
[06:07:23] <Cork> ^ needs to be done server side
[06:07:30] <john-dev> yepp, i will.. :)
[06:07:43] <krambiorix> when using autocomplete i use the select event to add an id to the element. But now the default behaviour is not executed. What can i do?
[06:08:32] <Cork> "default behavior"?
[06:08:34] <Cork> meaning?
[06:12:18] <Omar-> when I attach an event(s) to elm ".foo" and then .remove() it. after that I append a new ".foo" and attach same event(s), by removing first ".foo" the attached event(s) are remoevd too?
[06:16:25] <ajf-> I'm thinking $.each() is a very good option for avoiding errors when the DOM element you're trying to find isn't here. $('.myDiv').each(function() { }); even though there is only one element. This avoids processing anything for elements that are not there. Can anyone provide a different or better option ?
[06:19:44] <mooncup> ajf-: if you're doing the same thing to each one you can just use $('.element')
[06:19:53] <mooncup> but if you want to affect each one differently then each would be best
[06:20:07] <ajf-> mooncup the problem is when you run into a case where the element does not exist
[06:20:20] <BillCriswell> ajf-: Why is that a problem?
[06:21:32] <ajf-> BillCriswell: because when you try to manipulate non existing elements, you'll get errors
[06:21:33] <ajf-> no ?
[06:22:32] <Cork> ajf-: almost all built in jquery functions do .each internally
[06:22:37] <Cork> so most of the time you don't have to
[06:22:53] <BillCriswell> ajf-: The .each won't iterate unless there's elements to iterate through.
[06:22:57] <Cork> exceptions are things like .position().top (as top isn't a function)
[06:23:01] <mooncup> if you use a selector on a non-existant element then you generally won't get an error
[06:23:54] <ajf-> ah you're right
[06:23:59] <ajf-> you'll just get an empty array back each time
[06:24:28] <BillCriswell> It's like fucking up counting to zero.
[06:24:35] <Cork> ajf-: it isn't an array, but ya (its a jquery object)
[06:24:48] <sacho> ajf-, sure, but you don't often have to use .each() anyway.
[06:25:37] <sacho> and in some of those .each() cases, you want to handle the case of having no element specifically
[06:26:09] <ajf-> so you don't usually use var el1 = $('.el1'), el2= $('.el2'), el3 = $('.el3'); if (el1.length && el2.length && el3.length) { ... } ?
[06:26:25] <sacho> so it's a good option(like cork said, most built in jquery functions use it), it's just not a common one.
[06:26:36] <Cork> ajf-: depends on what you need to do
[06:26:54] <Cork> for example $('.el1').on('click', func); won't ever crash
[06:27:05] <Cork> even if there is no el1 elements in the page
[06:28:23] <ajf-> Cork: you mentioned position() (returns undefined). How would I know which ones work and which don't ?
[06:29:01] <Cork> ajf-: all functions that doesn't return a jquery object
[06:29:14] <Cork> see the return value in api.jquery.com
[06:29:20] <Cork> the list is fairly small
[06:29:31] <ajf-> so all chainable functions are safe
[06:29:37] <Cork> yes
[06:31:12] <Cork> .attr, .prop, .position, .offset, .data is the commands i can think of straight of the top of my head
[06:46:42] <kokut1> how do you select the first child of this?
[06:47:13] <Cork> kokut1: $(this).children().first()
[06:50:26] <kokut1> Cork: its targetting this
[06:55:11] <midori-rus> Json return an arrary sorted by name. But in mobile chrome it not sorts by name
[06:55:31] <midori-rus> I am adding json by append
[07:09:07] <BillCriswell> midori-rus: I don't understand what you're asking.
[07:24:13] <Guest67552> Hi! Could anyone recommend a combobox plugin? There are very many of them, and I don't know which to choose. I just want text input + choosing from a list.
[07:26:14] <YamakasY> hi guys, I'm trying to prefill a formfield using it's label in front where I get the data from my URL, I'm not able to "google" what I need to accomplish this
[07:46:19] <IamTrying> I have 20 RTSP camera, in Google Chrome how can i capture the stream? e.g: rtsp://root:root@ipcamera/h264 ?
[08:00:42] <BillCriswell> Guest67552: Chosen is pretty awesome.
[08:00:53] <Felishia> how do I restart jquery while running
[08:01:02] <Felishia> remove all data and events it added
[08:01:19] <patsToms> morning
[08:01:28] <Felishia> I change the innerHTML of some element, yet jquery seems to keep the events binds from the previous elements
[08:01:46] <Cork> Felishia: uh, jquery isn't a program
[08:01:54] <Cork> you don't restat it
[08:02:13] <BillCriswell> Guest67552: Ahh, so like a combobox? not so much an auto complete?
[08:02:15] <Cork> if you bind the events as delegated events they will stick around as long as that parent exist
[08:02:27] <patsToms> I have something random here. So - I have an image and I want to change it. I have an array with images. I made jquery function and did some $('img').superfunction(array); In that function i did setinterval. I have some struggle now
[08:02:42] <Felishia> Cork, how do I fix this problem them
[08:02:48] <patsToms> I am changeing image with replaceWith
[08:02:50] <Felishia> events are being fired 1 2 3 times
[08:02:59] <patsToms> and I am losing my selector
[08:03:09] <Cork> Felishia: start by finding where those events come from
[08:03:09] <Felishia> I need to remove all the data and all the events it set
[08:03:17] <Felishia> from a droppable
[08:03:20] <Cork> and create a fiddle with them so we can look at what you have
[08:03:22] <patsToms> any ideas how to resolve this?
[08:03:46] <Cork> patsToms: replace with just replaces the element with a new one
[08:03:57] <Cork> patsToms: you have to reselect them as it is new elements
[08:04:06] <Felishia> Cork, the code is insanely long and cryptic it's autogenerated from some source files, it'd take me longer to create a fiddle than just making a new app from zero
[08:04:20] <BillCriswell> Sounds like you might just want to replace the src of the <img>.
[08:04:23] <patsToms> Cork, is there any way to get that select string from this element?
[08:04:42] <Cork> patsToms: possibly the .selector property
[08:04:48] <Cork> but it might not be the full story
[08:05:04] <Felishia> where does jQuery save its data?
[08:05:07] <Felishia> I want to clear that
[08:05:09] <Cork> so i wouldn't depend on that being exact
[08:05:30] <Cork> Felishia: again jquery isn't a program
[08:05:37] <Cork> it doesn't work like that
[08:05:46] <Felishia> it must save its data somewhere
[08:05:50] <Cork> its a framework that makes it easier to work with the dom
[08:05:51] <Felishia> being or not a program
[08:05:55] <Cork> its called the dom
[08:06:15] <Felishia> so what does the $(...).data does then?
[08:06:22] <Felishia> and if I remove a node then why the info isn't gone
[08:06:35] <Cork> it connects the cache between the dom element and the data cache
[08:06:46] <Cork> but that isn't strictly related to the event handler
[08:07:06] <Cork> the dom has an event handler you need to find
[08:07:15] <Cork> this event handler processes the data you care about
[08:07:19] <Cork> remove the handler and the data dies
[08:07:34] <Cork> remove the data but leave the handler and you have js error
[08:10:17] <BillCriswell> Felishia: There is $el.removeData() so you could techincally do $('*').removeData() but something smells here.
[08:10:17] <BillCriswell> Hmm...
[08:10:23] <BillCriswell> Ah there it goes.
[08:12:46] <Felishia> BillCriswell, $(elem).droppable("destroy") worked but yet I don't get why the drop event stays even when I removed the element
[08:13:07] <Felishia> it seems to me like it shouldn't happen...
[08:13:54] <Felishia> I create one similar and it inherits all the drop events...
[08:14:02] <Felishia> but that isn't the same element
[08:14:15] <Felishia> however that doesn't happen with draggables
[08:18:09] <BillCriswell> Felishia: http://jsbin.com/roheco/1/edit?html,css,js,output Is what I just did to test and it seems to kill the drop event.
[08:18:19] <BillCriswell> Oh, my internet is being weird.
[08:18:37] <BillCriswell> So you're creating another .droppable and it's still doing the drop event?
[08:19:12] <Felishia> BillCriswell, no no I remove the element without running .destroy
[08:19:27] <Felishia> actually via pure js
[08:19:37] <Felishia> I get the parent element and run innerHTML = ""
[08:19:56] <Felishia> then I start reconstructing the scene, kind like a game when the whole information changes
[08:20:22] <Felishia> in one of the cases the instructions tell the generator to create another droppable which is in the same tree position of the previous droppable
[08:20:39] <Felishia> and it inherits all the properties of the previous one
[08:21:08] <Felishia> so I get my events fired twice, three, four... infinite times, depending to how many droppables have been created during the game
[08:21:17] <Felishia> and the current droppable
[08:22:31] <Felishia> to me if an element is removed, all the event handlers should be lost, not saved until an element that is in the same tree node position appears to be triggered again
[08:22:42] <BillCriswell> Felishia: http://jsbin.com/roheco/2/edit?html,js,output
[08:22:53] <BillCriswell> I can't replicate this.
[08:23:37] <Felishia> BillCriswell, what are you doing? XD hahaha my logs messages are crazy NEW DROP SHIT
[08:24:13] <BillCriswell> I just wanted to make sure it was very different from "DROPPED".
[08:24:18] <Felishia> BillCriswell, it's ok :) I just found the issue, I just wonder why it has to be like that
[08:24:38] <BillCriswell> Felishia: Clearning out an elements innerHTML wouldn't remove the events attached to  that element.
[08:25:27] <Felishia> BillCriswell, I mean <div id="parent><div id="children"></div></div>
[08:25:32] <Felishia> you clear the parent
[08:25:42] <Felishia> then children events should die
[08:26:08] <ajf-> I should do: if (preg_match....) {
[08:26:14] <ajf-> bah sry
[08:26:24] <Felishia> but guess what... I suddenly decide to do this parent.innerHMTL = "<div id='children2'></div>"
[08:26:37] <Felishia> and children2 has the same events as children
[08:26:58] <Felishia> so because children2 has event listeners too, and they're the same as children, then events are fired twice
[08:28:21] <FilipNortic> how do I check if a trigger is before or after?
[08:28:52] <BillCriswell> Felishia: I'd need to see a demo at this point.
[08:29:17] <Felishia> meh... my script is too complex :< and it's not even human generated
[08:29:35] <BillCriswell> Felishia: http://jsbin.com/timaji/1/edit?html,css,js,output was the demo I started up to try and illustrate how what you're describing wouldn't be possible.
[08:30:24] <BillCriswell> FilipNortic: Set a variable in one if it's set or not should tell you..
[08:30:39] <Felishia> BillCriswell, not click event, I said droppable event, and I meant creating a new child which seems identical to the first child
[08:30:46] <cjohnson> Felishia: paste
[08:30:59] <cjohnson> if you can understand your code I'm sure we can
[08:31:11] <Felishia> cjohnson, are you serious XD you'll get crazy with that
[08:31:13] <Felishia> okay
[08:31:31] <BillCriswell> Is children a droppable or or the parent?
[08:31:42] <FilipNortic> BillCriswell: well that was supose to be in the postgres channel thanks anyway
[08:31:58] <BillCriswell> FilipNortic: HAha welcome.
[08:32:00] <bl4ckdu5t> Hi y'all. How do I get the search box here http://codepen.io/bl4ckdu5t/pen/myLbNw to get fixed on scroll to a particular height?
[08:32:01] <IamTrying> http://www.chromium.org/developers/npapi-deprecation - because this will happen. Does it mean Flash will still work in Chrome/Canary?
[08:32:02] <cjohnson> if you want help we gotta know what you have Felishia
[08:32:27] <bl4ckdu5t> The pen shows my attempt to achieving it but it isn't working for me
[08:33:42] <Felishia> cjohnson, I found the issue actually, I just wonder why that happens... believe me, only I would understand my script, it's autogenerated from lots of code that's not even javascript or html but a pseudo-crazy-thing I invented
[08:33:53] <Felishia> it's even crashing kate
[08:34:10] <BillCriswell> Oooooo k.
[08:34:25] <BillCriswell> On that note I think I need some pizza.
[08:34:26] <cjohnson> Felishia: well, we can't tell you unless we see your code
[08:34:39] <cjohnson> events triggering twice means you're binding twice
[08:34:49] <cjohnson> event handlers triggering twice I mean
[08:35:12] <BillCriswell> I'm thinking you're nesting droppables.
[08:35:41] <Felishia> cjohnson, yes, I know I just wonder why they don't dissapear when I remove the element and create one very very very (just diff id) one
[08:36:03] <BillCriswell> Felishia: The browser has no idea how similar they are.
[08:36:09] <cjohnson> Felishia: need code to tell you
[08:36:16] <cjohnson> otherwise you're just spinning your wheels here
[08:36:41] <Felishia> I don't find a place to upload a paste file
[08:36:51] <Felishia> I can't copy it my text editor crashes
[08:37:36] <cjohnson> don't paste the entire thing just the code related to what you're talking about
[08:38:27] <BillCriswell> Felishia: http://jsbin.com/roheco/3/edit?html,js,output what you're doing shouldn't be vastly different from this demo
[08:38:45] <Felishia> http://textuploader.com/htuy
[08:39:12] <cjohnson> disable the minification step please
[08:39:15] <Felishia> alright if you understand XD; it's not minified, it's generated from my computer, I'm lazy I made my computer code from me
[08:39:25] <Felishia> it's not... that's the thing
[08:39:31] <BillCriswell> ...
[08:39:36] <Felishia> it's not minified, it's autogenerated
[08:39:40] <Felishia> I told you
[08:39:57] <cjohnson> and part of that generation appears to be minification...so go into that generation step and find the minification part and disable that please
[08:39:59] <Felishia> it's a node script that writes my script from html css and other js files
[08:40:26] <cjohnson> so you wrote CSS files all on one line?
[08:40:26] <krambiorix> Hi, why isn't the select or change event being fired when selecting a value with the TAB key?
[08:40:28] <krambiorix> http://jsfiddle.net/rje8dqbr/2/
[08:41:24] <cjohnson> highlighting an option isn't the same as selecting it, I believe
[08:41:39] <Felishia> cjohnson, that's what the template parser gives me... I'm not rewritting the parser to return beautified content
[08:41:58] <cjohnson> so you wrote CSS files yourself that are all on one line?
[08:42:05] <cjohnson> you wrote all your code without newlines?
[08:42:10] <Felishia> and if you see most of the code is not function(a,b)a.bla = b.d
[08:42:11] <cjohnson> at some point, there is normal CSS/JS no?
[08:42:18] <cjohnson> with newlines and spacing
[08:42:31] <Felishia> I don't write my code, my computer does >:c... it's all a tempalte, even js files are made from templates
[08:42:34] <cjohnson> krambiorix: you have to hit enter or click the item to trigger the select event
[08:42:39] <Felishia> XD
[08:42:48] <cjohnson> Felishia: yes, I understand that. but at *some* point those templates are built from properly spaced files
[08:42:52] <cjohnson> right?
[08:43:07] <cjohnson> it doesn't just generate code out of nowhere. you have source files somewhere
[08:43:19] <Felishia> cjohnson, yes... and it's about 50 files or so... that are not really css html or anything at all
[08:43:30] <Felishia> and may contain some lots of trash
[08:43:38] <cjohnson> you're missing my point
[08:43:44] <cjohnson> at some point, you have files with normal spacing in them
[08:43:50] <cjohnson> then something in your generator is removing that spacing
[08:43:51] <Felishia> yes sure...
[08:43:52] <cjohnson> so disable that.
[08:43:57] <cjohnson> so we can see useful output
[08:44:00] <Felishia> my generator is not that complex
[08:44:15] <cjohnson> I don't care if you have to go into the function that does the space removal and comment that out
[08:44:21] <cjohnson> just make it happen. otherwise there's no way to debug this code
[08:44:28] <cjohnson> and if you can't debug your own code, your build script sucks.
[08:44:35] <Felishia> o.o but I just debug it...
[08:44:49] <cjohnson> it sounded like you still had questions about it
[08:45:02] <cjohnson> but if your problem is solved and you have no questions then I guess there's nothing else to do here
[08:45:23] <cjohnson> either way, your build script *sucks* if you can't get unminified output and you should improve it. debugging is essential
[08:45:31] <Felishia> yes but the code works... anyway, I'm not rewritting a beta beta beta version that I'm going to trash anyway
[08:45:38] * cjohnson shrugs
[08:45:41] <cjohnson> enjoy then
[08:46:08] <Felishia> geez I'll never understand programmers... even when I'm one...
[08:46:22] <cjohnson> what's to understand? All I want is unminified output
[08:46:30] <BillCriswell> Felishia: You're being difficult to understand.
[08:46:33] <cjohnson> if you wrote the generator you should know how to disable the space-removing bit
[08:46:51] <Felishia> I can remove some but not all
[08:47:02] <bl4ckdu5t> Please any help on this http://codepen.io/bl4ckdu5t/pen/myLbNw
[08:47:20] <Felishia> if I wanted to, it would be quite hard and would take me some time... aaaaah... I have to keep working!
[08:47:22] <bl4ckdu5t> cjohnson, BillCriswell
[08:47:29] <cjohnson> Felishia: well, that's your next project. improve your build script
[08:47:55] <Felishia> cjohnson, that's right, I said it was a beta beta beta version, literally, my boss is like, write that fast, no not fast, faster, no no way fastest...
[08:48:17] <BillCriswell> "any help" doesn't describe a specific problem.
[08:48:23] <randomguy_> .......hyper light-speed!
[08:48:31] <randomguy_> or what was the speed in space balls?
[08:48:39] <bl4ckdu5t> BillCriswell: I posted the problem earlier but it was just ignored
[08:48:52] <Felishia> basically XD my template parser is just three lines XD and I took it from a website...
[08:48:55] <bl4ckdu5t> I want a scroll-fix content effect there
[08:49:07] <bl4ckdu5t> see my attempt in the jQuery code
[08:49:27] <Felishia> bye bye have a nice day guys, and don't be evil... :3 calm down
[08:49:32] <Felishia> relaaaax
[08:49:44] <bl4ckdu5t> After scrolling to the search input area, I want to toggle a class fixed on #wrap
[08:50:00] <BillCriswell> lol oh boy
[08:50:14] <bl4ckdu5t> complex much?
[08:50:51] <BillCriswell> bl4ckdu5t: No, just the person who left.
[08:51:07] <BillCriswell> bl4ckdu5t: You're close here though. What's up with the #wrap?
[08:51:08] <bl4ckdu5t> haha Felishia
[08:51:36] <bl4ckdu5t> I want #wrap to get .fixed when scrolled
[08:51:55] <BillCriswell> when the document is scrolled or wrap itself?
[08:52:47] <bl4ckdu5t> either way will be nice but I targeted #wrap to be more specific
[08:53:30] <bl4ckdu5t> if it can give what I want on document scroll to certain height, I wouldn't mind using document.scroll
[08:53:44] <BillCriswell> bl4ckdu5t: Ok, scroll events won't bubble, especially downwards.
[08:53:58] <BillCriswell> So remove the "#wrap" part.
[08:54:17] <BillCriswell> then in the callback for scroll do console.log(window.scrollTop) and see if that's returning what you think.
[08:54:50] <bl4ckdu5t> so just on('scroll', callback) ?
[08:55:06] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:55:58] <bl4ckdu5t> I'm getting undefined
[08:56:03] <BillCriswell> You're currently doing .on('scroll', '#wrap', function () { }); just do .on('scroll', function () { });
[08:56:57] <bl4ckdu5t> I have changed to that. From the console log, window.scrollTop gives undefined on each scroll
[08:57:43] <bl4ckdu5t> pen has been updated, you can try it out
[08:58:10] <BillCriswell> Right, so window.scrollTop isn't what you want.
[08:59:11] <bl4ckdu5t> yea so how do I get distance from top then?
[08:59:12] <BillCriswell> Also, toggleClass() will toggle the class on every scroll, which isn't what you want.
[09:00:18] <bl4ckdu5t> Even with the condition?
[09:00:37] <BillCriswell> You can do $(window).scrollTop() or document.body.scrollTop, I'd go with the jQuery way in case there's any inconsistencies.
[09:00:59] <BillCriswell> bl4ckdu5t: That condition will fire every time the scrollTop() is greater than 170px
[09:01:12] <BillCriswell> so, after 170px, it'll start toggling on and off.
[09:01:26] <BillCriswell> so at 171 it'll be there, 172 it won't, 173 it will, and so on.
[09:01:52] <BillCriswell> What you can do is move the condition to toggleClass itself.
[09:02:17] <BillCriswell> .toggleClass('fixed', $(window).scrollTop() > 170);
[09:02:35] <BillCriswell> Though, I'd cache that to avoid shit loads of loopups.
[09:03:59] <BillCriswell> bl4ckdu5t: http://codepen.io/bl4ckdu5t/pen/myLbNw so essentially I'd arrive at this
[09:04:14] <BillCriswell> I'm not positive clicking that will give you what I see... but I think it should lol
[09:04:43] <BillCriswell> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/raQwez that should definitely.
[09:05:20] <BillCriswell> Ok lunch time brb.
[09:05:26] <bl4ckdu5t> great. Thanks a lot
[09:05:36] <BillCriswell> bl4ckdu5t: No problem.
[09:43:55] <Tomasso> I have some autocomplete fields that are loaded with information by default as soon page loads. how do i make them not to trigger the on change event that makes them do ajax requests to retrieve information ?>
[09:44:50] * robertmaxrees looks into crystal ball
[09:44:55] <Tomasso> i tried to disable the .autocomplete().. and it didnt work,, should be smth that locks them, or make them change only on key user input, and not info loaded by set
[09:45:04] <robertmaxrees> Tomasso it's hard to see
[09:45:08] <cjohnson> check line 29 Tomasso
[09:45:12] <cjohnson> no wait 30
[09:45:53] <slax0r> cjohnson: wrong! its ont line 41!
[09:45:56] <slax0r> on*
[09:46:10] <Tomasso> haha ermpty line
[09:46:24] <cjohnson> maybe it's using an invisible font
[09:46:41] <slax0r> ^
[09:46:45] <slax0r> phantom-font
[09:46:54] <slax0r> very common in most known editors and ides
[09:56:44] <tvle83> i have a drop down menu that is not a select box, it is a list of <li> so i have jquery hide and show the list. i want to make it disappear when the user clicks anywhere else besides in the list, is there a way to do this ?
[09:57:32] <jeanre> anyone know of a plugin that enables image manipulation (sepia, greyscale etc)
[09:57:55] <robertmaxrees> tvle83 an event listener on the document that checks if the event.target or one of its parents is the list and, if not, close it.
[09:59:51] <tvle83> robertmaxrees ok thanks
[10:01:45] <randomguy_> http://jsfiddle.net/8gk2j3kd/ ; test is failing as the result does not have the second \n before the inserted \t\t.  Running the actual code does insert the \n.  Is there something i'm missing on the event in the test that is the part that actually inserts the \n into the textarea?
[10:18:06] <randomguy_> modified http://jsfiddle.net/8gk2j3kd/1/
[10:19:22] <Meshezabeel> I have data that is being updated every few seconds in a database and then hundreds of requests each minute to retrieve the updated data for ajax/jquery purposes. Would it be more efficient to save to an xml file every time there's a change and then have the hundreds of clients download the xml file instead of having the clients pull from the database?
[10:19:49] <robertmaxrees> randomguy_ i'm confused by your question.
[10:20:02] <NoiseEee> Meshezabeel: sockets, push changes to browser
[10:20:27] <randomguy_> robertmaxrees: i'm trying to simulate the pressing of the enter key in a textarea, thus inserting a \n
[10:20:48] <robertmaxrees> randomguy_ okay.  so you want to enter an extra character?
[10:22:03] <randomguy_> robertmaxrees: the code is inserting tab characters in the browser.  when i write the test for it, it is inserting the tabs still, but not the \n, which -is- being inserting in the browser ran version.  So i'm missing something in the test.  the updated jsfiddle has a reduced version of it showing the \n is not being inserted.
[10:22:26] <randomguy_> http://jsfiddle.net/8gk2j3kd/2/
[10:23:03] <Meshezabeel> NoiseEee: That does not answer my question
[10:23:07] <robertmaxrees> randomguy_ right, because you're triggering events, not necessarily entering chars.  if you need to insert a carriage return, you should manipulate the string and go from there.
[10:23:40] <randomguy_> so for the test attach a custom handle to keydown to insert the \n?
[10:24:03] <robertmaxrees> randomguy_ no.  get the .val() of the textarea, do an index-based string split, and reconstruct the string from there.
[10:24:43] <NoiseEee> Meshezabeel: ok, the DB is the more 'efficient' of the two, but still nothing as efficient as setting up simple websockets
[10:31:00] <randomguy_> got it, heh.  that just seems jankey
[10:40:47] <Meshezabeel> Thanks NoiseEee, do you recommend socket.io/node.js
[10:43:09] <randomguy__> Meshezabeel: we have an app in our shop that uses grails/websockets/akka which has a very low response time and very interactive front end
[10:43:26] <randomguy__> Meshezabeel: as an option
[10:43:39] <Meshezabeel> Thanks randomguy__
[10:43:54] <randomguy__> Meshezabeel: however node.js is also very nice
[10:49:23] <JuJuBee> If I have ID's like (row_col) 0_0 -> 8_8 how can I select with row<3 and col>4 for example?
[10:50:09] <cjohnson> don't use Ids for that JuJuBee
[10:50:20] <cjohnson> use other attributes. like data-row="3" data-col="4"
[10:50:38] <JuJuBee> cjohnson: thanks for that.
[10:54:29] <JuJuBee> cjohnson: then $("[data-row<3]") ?
[10:54:40] <robertmaxrees> use .filter() for that.
[11:14:14] <nickenchuggets> how do you set a div so that it's scrolled all the way to the bottom
[11:14:27] <cjohnson> "scrolled all the way to the bottom" meaning what?
[11:14:34] <cjohnson> position: absolute; bottom: 0;  ??
[11:14:41] <robertmaxrees> like it's a scrollable area and you want it to be at the bottom of said area?
[11:14:42] <randomguy__> yeah, was going to say that
[11:14:49] <nickenchuggets> robertmaxrees: yes
[11:15:01] <robertmaxrees> set its scrolltop to the height of its content.
[11:15:18] <nickenchuggets> robertmaxrees: I want to use some jquery wizardry to set a scrollable div to be scrolled all the way to the bottom
[11:15:45] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/scrolltop/ this is what you want.
[11:17:03] <nickenchuggets> "The vertical scroll position is the same as the number of pixels that are hidden from view above the scrollable area."
[11:18:12] <nickenchuggets> so if the height of a div with scrollable content altogether is 5000 pixels, and the div has a height of 1000 pixels... setting it to 4000 would be setting the scroll position to the very bottom, I gather.
[11:19:14] <nickenchuggets> so, I'm thinking now, what I need is a way to retrieve the total height of the div and all of its hidden content
[11:19:45] <nickenchuggets> and then to scroll it to the bottom, subtract the visible height from the total height
[11:20:14] <nickenchuggets> and set scrollTop to be the result of that
[11:21:16] <cjohnson> can you wrap the inner content in a div and then calculate the height of that div?
[11:22:21] <nickenchuggets> ah, cool, scrollHeight
[11:22:23] <nickenchuggets> is what I need
[11:23:36] <cjohnson> I think you could also just do scrollTop(9999) or some absurdly high number. though your way is definitely better
[11:23:48] <robertmaxrees> eh, there always winds up being that weird edge case.
[11:24:07] <cjohnson> yeah
[11:27:01] <nickenchuggets> also, how about disabling horizontal scrollbars?
[11:27:33] <cjohnson> make the inner content fit correctly or hide it with overflow-x: hidden
[11:27:35] <nickenchuggets> yeah, I figured out a good solution, $('thing').scrollHeight - $('thing').height()
[11:35:27] <Es0teric> quick question, how do i target the contents of only a div that belong to the button that was clicked on the on click event?
[11:35:55] <robertmaxrees> you can do something like $(this).closest('div');
[11:36:35] <Es0teric> lets say <div class="container-image">  <button type="submit" class="upload_button"> Upload Image </button> </div>
[11:36:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you use .closest()
[11:37:34] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees ok so i have right now $('.upload_button').on('click', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); })
[11:37:58] <robertmaxrees> i already showed you an example :)
[11:39:35] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees thats not working
[11:39:41] <robertmaxrees> fiddle it.
[11:39:45] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees yeah sec
[11:39:55] <robertmaxrees> :) i guarantee you it works
[11:40:29] <JuJuBee> Why is this http://pastebin.com/edb399eN  selecting all divs when row and col are correct (i tested with alert)
[11:40:58] <robertmaxrees> $("div").attr("data-col") < col; isn't doing what you think it is.
[11:41:22] <robertmaxrees> use .data('col') instead.  that should coerce it to a number automatically.
[11:42:06] <JuJuBee> robertmaxrees: where?
[11:42:35] <robertmaxrees> every time you use .attr('data-row') or .attr('data-col'), you should use .data() instead.
[11:43:18] <JuJuBee> so $("div").data('data-row')  < row ?
[11:43:27] <robertmaxrees> .data('row')
[11:43:31] <tasaif> unless you're dealing with a library that used attr('data-row')
[11:43:41] <robertmaxrees> in this case, they're likely not.
[11:46:49] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/0uzrfogt/
[11:47:09] <robertmaxrees> ... wat
[11:47:13] <robertmaxrees> this is not what i suggested.
[11:47:47] <robertmaxrees> are you talking about getting the containing div when you click any .image_upload_button ?
[11:49:41] <robertmaxrees> i assume you wanted something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0uzrfogt/1/
[11:52:55] <JuJuBee> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/3ko8sy1o/2/  still selecting all divs.
[11:54:50] <robertmaxrees> sec.
[11:56:13] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3ko8sy1o/4/
[11:56:14] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees i want the val to only be jailed to the hidden field that the current div belongs to
[11:56:27] <robertmaxrees> JuJuBee you wanted $(this) inside the filter, not $('div')
[11:56:38] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees so right now it posts on both .hidden_img
[11:56:59] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric okay, so use .closest() to get the parent .item_container, and then use .find from ther.e
[11:57:12] <Es0teric> ahhhh
[11:57:14] <Es0teric> ok now i get you
[11:57:46] <robertmaxrees> or use it to find the closest li, either/or
[11:57:48] <JuJuBee> robertmaxrees: thanks, missed that.
[11:59:19] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees right now its still posting to both .hidden_img input fields
[11:59:26] <Es0teric> i just want it to post to the current one
[11:59:28] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[11:59:34] <robertmaxrees> i feel like you're missing a step here.
[12:01:28] <Es0teric> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0uzrfogt/1/embedded/result/ robertmaxrees  look in the structure, find the value="2054"
[12:01:41] <Es0teric> you'll see it on both places
[12:01:45] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:01:50] <robertmaxrees> i didn't give you the working version.
[12:01:58] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees yeah i realize that
[12:02:06] <robertmaxrees> i gave you an example of how to find the closest parent .item-container.
[12:02:10] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees i get that
[12:02:15] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:02:16] <Es0teric> but i am telling you what i am attempting to do
[12:02:20] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to do this for you.
[12:02:21] <robertmaxrees> try.
[12:02:37] <Es0teric> ok so just for the record i did do what you said
[12:02:40] <Es0teric> and it still posts on both sides
[12:02:43] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[12:02:44] <robertmaxrees> prove it.
[12:02:50] <JuJuBee> robertmaxrees: what if I wanted to select rows based on row and columns based on col at the same time?
[12:02:51] <tasaif> what's going on here?
[12:03:08] <robertmaxrees> JuJuBee you can do whatever you want in that filter.
[12:03:58] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric i don't mean to be a jerk but what you're looking to do is relatively trivial - show me what you've tried.  this is how you'll learn :)
[12:05:04] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees oh nvm lol i just forgot to refresh my page
[12:05:04] <Es0teric> =_=

[12:05:22] <robertmaxrees> JuJuBee fsho
[12:05:25] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees -> button.closest('.item-container').find('.hidden_img').val(_custom_media);
[12:05:35] <robertmaxrees> that'll do it.
[12:05:38] <Es0teric> thats what i have.. where var button = $(this)

[12:21:41] <robertmaxrees> mdm__ a delegated event listener.
[12:21:50] <robertmaxrees> you then have $(this) as a reference to the current element.
[12:23:38] <mdm__> robertmaxrees: that looks like exactly what I need, thanks!

[13:35:55] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16152073/prevent-bootstrap-modal-from-disappearing-when-clicking-outside-or-pressing-esca might help
[13:36:31] <testerbit> tried that, but no luck so far. Maybe will try in the html
[13:36:56] <robertmaxrees> if you're initializing in the HTML, then you'll have to use the HTML version.
[13:37:14] <testerbit> I'm initializing with jQuery
[13:37:25] <robertmaxrees> then you'll need the javascript option.

[14:24:44] <samu> Hi
[14:24:52] <samu> if I specify a relative path for .load(), is it possible to make it use https>
[14:24:52] <samu> ?
[14:25:06] <robertmaxrees> it should if the current page is https
[14:25:21] <samu> well, it isn't ;P
[14:25:35] <robertmaxrees> and you don't have any mixed content or anything weird like that?
[14:25:39] <OverCore> Hi, what is the best color picker for jQuery?
[14:25:43] <samu> nothing I can find
[14:25:49] <samu> the lock is green and no errors are reported
[14:26:15] <robertmaxrees> samu check your network tab and make sure you aren't getting redirected.
[14:27:58] <samu> robertmaxrees: oh, crap! :-)
[14:28:08] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:28:10] <samu> I forgot about the django language in url feature.
[14:45:06] <Replica> hello? I have a form in my zend framework application, and I need to know if is ok send my form via AJAX with JSON or I need other datatype.
[14:52:27] <robertmaxrees> you can do that.
[14:57:25] <Replica> robertmaxrees, but it does not work.. my inputs are empties if I use ajax
[14:57:40] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you're trying to do then.
[14:58:02] <robertmaxrees> you'll probably need to modify the server-side to accept the form data as ajax, instead of in the traditional format.
[14:58:09] <robertmaxrees> but that shouldn't be too difficult.
[15:06:53] <Lencl> I have a span with id "whatpage"
[15:07:18] <Lencl> when I do.. alert($('#whatpage').html());   it works but when I do $("#whatpage').html('blah blah');.. it doesn't
[15:07:29] <Lencl> what can possible be the cause of this? the code right after too
[15:08:12] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you do console.log($('[id="whatpage"]').length) ?
[15:09:32] <Lencl> shows 12
[15:09:38] <robertmaxrees> that's your problem.
[15:09:42] <robertmaxrees> you can only use an ID once per page.
[15:09:44] <Lencl> cause I have "testest" as default
[15:09:51] <Lencl> ah
[15:10:14] <robertmaxrees> so #whatpage is only getting the first one.  use a class instead or remove all but one.
[15:11:14] <Lencl> ah okay great works now ty:)
[15:15:08] <jfive> robertmaxrees: when you recommended they do console.log($('[id="whatpage"]').length) does that give any different of a result than console.log($('#whatpage').length) would?
[15:15:15] <robertmaxrees> yes
[15:15:17] <jfive> just curious
[15:15:22] <jfive> ah ok, interesting
[15:15:42] <jfive> so console.log($('#whatpage').length) would just return 1, right?
[15:15:46] <robertmaxrees> always, yeah.
[15:15:51] <compact> hey. I'm creating a page where i have 'manifests', there are multiple 'lines' in the 'manifest'. now i want to have a 'manifest' area where i type all the manifest numbers out, i think want to link the 'manifest' to the 'lines'. any idea what i could use to achieve this? thanks
[15:15:52] <jfive> gotcha, thanks man
[15:15:52] <robertmaxrees> because that makes to document.getElementByID()
[15:16:18] <robertmaxrees> compact literally no way to know without seeing what you're working with.
[15:18:41] <compact> http://i.imgur.com/qWdrmIg.png
[15:18:54] <compact> each line may have the same 'manifest' or a different 'manifest' number
[15:19:05] <compact> instead of them typing the manifest each time, iw anted to see if there is a better way to do it
[15:19:34] <tasaif> AtomicB0mB: sure
[15:19:42] <robertmaxrees> are you looking at many to one, or many to many?
[15:20:01] <compact> bit of both
[15:20:08] <robertmaxrees> it needs to be one or another.
[15:20:25] <robertmaxrees> could a line ever identify with more than one manifest?
[15:20:47] <compact> no
[15:21:00] <robertmaxrees> okay, so it's a many to one - many lines to one manifest?
[15:21:40] <compact> probably 5-8max
[15:21:49] <robertmaxrees> the actual amount is irrelevant fwiw.
[15:21:58] <robertmaxrees> "many" in this case simply means "more than 1"
[15:22:14] <robertmaxrees> you could do this a few different ways - a basic "tagging" system where that column has an autocomplete might be helpful.
[15:22:43] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you'd want a different view that would let people select a manifest and enter in a series of "lines" that correspond.
[15:22:49] <robertmaxrees> even better would be to do both.
[15:24:15] <AtomicB0mB> tasaif =)
[15:24:20] <compact> great, thanks for that
[15:25:06] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[15:43:09] <Replica> Hello, in my ajax data.. I need to use $('form').serialize() or what?
[15:43:27] <robertmaxrees> that or collect your data some other way.
[15:43:51] <jxtps> jQuery barfs on $("#hello/world")
[15:44:03] <robertmaxrees> you need to escape that /
[15:44:04] <jxtps> despite / being a legal character in html5 ids
[15:44:06] <Replica> because my inputs names are "form[inputname]", because I use a framework
[15:44:37] <jxtps> unfortunately the actual call to jquery is from a plugin
[15:44:46] <jxtps> and I don't have the ability to escape...
[15:44:51] <jxtps> hmm...
[15:45:09] <tasaif> jxtps: can you overwrite the function prototype?
[15:45:11] <jxtps> $("#hello\/world") also barfs
[15:45:29] <robertmaxrees> \\ jxtps
[15:45:42] <jxtps> ok, thanks!
[15:45:58] <jxtps> (I think I can get the thing escaped, will have to dig into the plugin)
[16:37:12] <jak2000> hi all
[16:37:33] <jak2000> i want to do a post with jquery (passing 7 paramters) how do it?
[17:00:27] <frabblerock> http://dev.buffalonews.com/Brett/thingstodo.buffalonews.com/events/ - need some help with jquery. I want the top of the sidebar to scroll back 20px from the top of the window when the bottom of it reaches the top of the window.
[17:12:48] <ignite_v2> I have this function http://pastie.org/10031832 that scrolls to a div. but the thing is that when i move the scroll just after it reached the bottom, it keeps like freezing and trying to send me to the bottom. is anyway  to fix that? this is the page: http://winelistplease.com/
[17:13:26] <robertmaxrees> "move the scroll"?
[17:13:50] <frabblerock> lol
[17:14:58] <robertmaxrees> yeah i have no clue what the bug is.  nothing seems amiss at that second link, ignite_v2
[17:15:38] <ignite_v2> when you click lean more and try to  scroll the page up/down
[17:16:23] <robertmaxrees> works fine here.
[17:16:33] <ignite_v2> click lean more and right away move up?
[17:16:49] <robertmaxrees> looks like there's a small glitch in chrome.
[17:17:02] <ignite_v2> yeah, im testing in chrome
[17:18:28] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[17:19:50] <robertmaxrees> first off, why do you have the entire binding wrapped in a function?
[17:20:09] <ignite_v2> i didnt build that page
[17:20:09] <robertmaxrees> ah nevermind.  i see it now.
[17:20:22] <ignite_v2> someone else did, im trying to fix some small things :)
[17:20:35] <robertmaxrees> you want something like http://fixee.org/paste/poy0xqq/
[17:20:43] <robertmaxrees> not 100% perfect, but it should get the idea accross.
[17:21:31] <ignite_v2> let me give it a try
[17:21:47] <ignite_v2> so prevent the scroll :)
[17:21:52] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[17:22:01] <robertmaxrees> that might not work 100%.
[17:22:03] <robertmaxrees> but you get the idea.
[17:22:43] <ignite_v2> yeah
[17:29:47] <frabblerock> https://jsfiddle.net/sf8r5xjb/4/ - can anyone help me with this. I have it working correctly  the first time, but it stops working "correctly" thereafter. I want it to run everytime the bottom of the the div reaches the top of the window.
[17:32:44] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/sf8r5xjb/5/ with some minor cleanup - doesn't fix your issue.
[17:34:20] <robertmaxrees> otherwise is seems to work fine.
[17:34:30] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/sf8r5xjb/6/ this might work a bit better,
[17:35:53] <frabblerock> robertmaxrees
[17:36:25] <frabblerock> its scrolling on scroll though rather than when the bottom of the div reaches the top of the window
[17:36:32] <frabblerock> like it does on the first scroll
[17:36:48] <robertmaxrees> so you want it to wait until after the scrollTop reaches the bottom of the div?
[17:36:57] <frabblerock> yeah
[17:36:59] <frabblerock> if you notice
[17:37:03] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:37:05] <robertmaxrees> so math.
[17:37:05] <frabblerock> thats how it works on the first scroll
[17:38:53] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to calculate the bottom the the scrolling div from the top of the window.
[17:39:43] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sf8r5xjb/8/ something like this.
[17:40:02] <robertmaxrees> that's going to be a little bug-prone, but this gets you started in the right direction.
[17:40:28] <robertmaxrees> another way to do it would be to check if the current window.scrollTop() is divisible by the height of the scrolling div.
[17:40:51] <frabblerock> got it!
[17:40:52] <frabblerock> thank you
[17:42:05] <frabblerock> although this doesnt undo on scrollup
[17:46:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's where the evenly divisible stuff will come into play.
[17:46:30] <robertmaxrees> and a !== instead of >
[17:47:08] <robertmaxrees> what is this for, exactly?
[17:58:34] <neredsenvy> Is there a way to cut a HTML div from current page and redirect or post to another url/page on same server and insert it in a div on that page.
[19:15:15] <vivekananda> anyone around ? but I guess  I need to go to js
[20:56:34] <iconicflux> http://jsfiddle.net/z92kw8jf/ <-- anyone mind helping me figure out why this regex isn't working?
[21:38:36] <helpmeplease> is anyone available to give me a hand with some REALLY basic jQuery stuff? it's actually embarrassing how simple it should be but i can't find anything online
[21:41:14] <forQuery> you shouldnt ask to ask
[21:41:15] <forQuery> you should ask
[21:43:43] <helpmeplease> ok well i'm working on a choose your own adventure for school and i'm wondering the easiest way to allow the reader to input their name on the intro page and have it appear in the story
[21:45:58] <forQuery> http://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_prompt
[21:48:05] <helpmeplease> will that allow for inputs to carry into separate html pages?
[21:53:31] <forQuery> for that you have to use a database or localstorage
[21:54:14] <forQuery> are you saying you want it to be a form?
[21:54:21] <forQuery> on one page?
[21:54:34] <forQuery> you cant go page to page to page and transfer data without a database to save the data.
[21:56:32] <helpmeplease> actually i would only need it for one page, nvm. is there a way i can get the box for submitting your name to appear immediately when the page loads? i'm trying $(document).ready(function() { but it doesn't seem to be working
[22:05:48] <helpmeplease> i basically just need the prompt to appear before anyone has the option to read the intro to the story
[22:50:57] <cyberbrai> Hey is there any one working on drag org chart
[22:51:29] <cyberbrai> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4151695/html/jOrgChart/example/example.html
[22:51:35] <cyberbrai> some thing like that
[23:49:00] <CorySimmons> When I scroll, I want to check the current window.scrolltop vs. $(elem).offset().top. This works the first time, and I add new items to $(elem), but as i keep scrolling, it just remembers the first result and constantly adds new items to my element
[23:49:12] <CorySimmons> I'm sure this is some sort of binding issue, but I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong
[23:49:36] <CorySimmons> Here's the code http://pastie.org/10032269
[23:50:44] <CorySimmons> It's a ghetto infinite scroll that hides all the elements (except 2) at the beginning, and as you scroll to the bottom of the container, it is supposed to display 2 more each time you hit the bottom of the container (which is always expanding as there are 2 items being introduced to the container frequently)
[23:50:54] <CorySimmons> Any help with this binding issue would be appreciated
[23:56:22] <crantron> http://pastebin.com/rchh8Mmg : questions are inline with the code at lines 31, and 41. I'm just having a hard time conceptually with scope. I thought I got it but nope, nope I do not.
[23:56:55] <crantron> any help would be much appreciated :)
