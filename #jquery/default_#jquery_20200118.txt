[00:46:21] <Bluerate> hello, I have input tag on xml template, after filling and press submit .. it's cleared how to resolve that
[01:11:45] <pavonia> Bluerate: Is the page reloaded on submit?
[01:16:26] <Bluerate> pavonia: yes it's reloaded 2 times
[01:18:21] <pavonia> That's the problem then, the server doesn'T fill the values if they had been submitted previously
[01:19:13] <pavonia> You could also add the click handler with jQuery such that the submit is handled with JS
[01:22:23] <Bluerate> how to do that
[01:24:59] <Bluerate> what should i add in the function
[01:28:55] <pavonia> See the examples here https://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[13:22:12] <halvard> Hello.. I am trying to send a POST request with js, but when I press submit it redirect me with a GET...
[13:22:14] <halvard> https://jsfiddle.net/halvardq/50xqfs9u/
[13:22:58] <halvard> If I change the submit to type="button", it does the same... But if I change the id, the button doesnt do anything
[13:23:09] <halvard> Why does it redirect me? :/
[13:24:01] <halvard> The submit button is the last button in the jsfiddle preview
[13:25:39] <shoky_> halvard: post submits are commonly redirected to a GET url by the server
[13:26:47] <shoky_> simpler to manage it on backend, and it makes refreshing the page not re-post the post request
[13:27:13] <halvard> Ok, but the same exact code works for my login :/

[13:27:46] <halvard> "min side" -> logg inn
[13:30:02] <shoky_> donno what you're doing on the backend..
[13:31:31] <halvard> Imma post to test.php with echo "Hello World"; and see
[13:32:47] <halvard> if you press "Annonser bil" (submit) on the url I provided, it still is the same.. Backend php is only echo hello world :/
[13:34:37] <shoky_> halvard ah i see the problem
[13:34:43] <shoky_> location = document.getElementById("location").value;
[13:35:17] <shoky_> that changes the window.location property, causing browser to browse to that url
[13:35:36] <shoky_> halvard: use local variables..  const location = ...;
[13:35:56] <halvard> Lol :D
[13:36:52] <halvard> Thank youuu!!! \o/
