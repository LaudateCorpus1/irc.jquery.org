[00:04:41] <jrockjiggz> Umren: thats the way it was designed.  Description: Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements.  .val() Description:
[00:13:26] <Hypah> can i add a custom function to a jquery element like $(myDiv).myFunction (function(e) { alert(1); });
[00:13:45] <Umren> jrockjiggz: how to get multiple values then?
[00:16:10] <imakewebthings> Hypah: yes, here is a repo that contains boilerplates for several differnt plugin patterns: https://github.com/addyosmani/jquery-plugin-patterns
[00:18:26] <imakewebthings> Hypah: and the official plugin guidelines are always good too http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[00:19:11] <imakewebthings> Umren: $(stuff).each(function() { $(this).val() });
[00:32:30] <Hypah> how do i make an image completely non-interactive? i don't want it to be possible to select it, nor drag it, etc.
[00:47:44] <Umren> imakewebthings: tried this, and it returns not a text but a group of tags http://minus.com/mbb2ehF0PB#1o
[00:48:32] <imakewebthings> Umren, yea, EACH returns the original object
[00:48:59] <imakewebthings> if you want the return value to be an array of the values, you need to use map
[00:49:35] <Umren> hm.. map returns just []
[00:49:59] <imakewebthings> Umren: $(stuff).map(function() { return $(this).val() });
[00:50:03] <imakewebthings> you need to return inside
[00:50:19] <Umren> horray
[00:50:27] <Umren> working :)
[00:50:32] <Umren> ty
[00:50:37] <imakewebthings> np
[00:50:45] <Umren> map is original javascript function ?
[00:52:17] <JesperA> does .mousedown work on touchpanels to or is it just .click that works on touchpanels?
[01:04:12] <Hypah> how do i make a .mouseup event that captures all possible mouseups?
[01:24:24] <MACscr> anyone know of an extremely lightweight "shadowbox" or "lightbox", whatever its called, plugin that I can simply use to display a login form?
[01:35:18] <JesperA> MACscr just hide the loginform with "$(".loginform").hide();", and use .click(function() to show the loginform, cant be more lightweight than that
[01:41:51] <MACscr> ah, duh, good point
[01:49:18] <MACscr> JesperA: what css attributes are used to create that transparent shadow affect to the rest of the page?
[01:49:54] <JesperA> you want to fade the rest of the page and just keep the loginform in focus?
[01:50:20] <MACscr> yep
[01:50:38] <MACscr> basically in the middle of the page, like most lightboxes
[01:50:43] <MACscr> client wants a specific look
[01:53:11] <JesperA> just make a div that is hidden, width: 100%; height; 100%; position: absolute (or whatever), and background:  rgba(0,0,0,0.5);, z-index that is higher than every other element but lover than the loginform, then just toggle it with the loginform
[01:53:52] <MACscr> ok, will try it out. thanks for the advice
[01:58:21] <svcghost> Do you guys agree the best way to check if an element exists is:    if($(#elemID).length >0)
[02:06:13] <ANIE> ciao
[02:06:16] <ANIE> !list
[02:11:33] <imakewebthings> svcghost, generally yes
[02:12:03] <imakewebthings> svcghost, but you don't need the > 0
[02:12:23] <imakewebthings> if ($(selector).length))
[02:12:32] <imakewebthings> 0 will coerce to false
[02:14:14] <svcghost> thanks imakewebthings ;)
[02:14:35] <imakewebthings> svcghost: more goodies on the subject: https://github.com/rwldrn/idiomatic.js#cond
[02:15:33] <svcghost> perfect ty man
[02:19:17] <svcghost> so that's all about optimization imakewebthings right?
[02:21:22] <imakewebthings> svcghost: well, extremely small ones, in terms of file size (a few chars)
[02:22:02] <svcghost> ah ok
[02:22:04] <imakewebthings> svcghost: more like standard practice, and a bit of a litmus test for whether one knows some of the details of JS
[02:22:46] <imakewebthings> svcghost: if you see stuff like if (somenumber > 0) you might think the author doesn't know how type coercion works in the language
[02:23:05] <svcghost> hehe gotcha
[02:23:11] <svcghost> like me
[02:23:49] <imakewebthings> heh the little crazy things in JS go deep, i still learn new ones all the time
[02:24:00] <svcghost> How about on another note
[02:24:08] <svcghost> so right now I am doing three different checks to check for selected text
[02:24:19] <ravenzz> it is the same for other languages tho
[02:24:24] <svcghost> using javascript. but is there an easier way to check for selected text with jQuery?
[02:24:27] <svcghost> highlighted text
[02:24:43] <svcghost> my searches on google aren't helping
[02:25:39] <imakewebthings> ravenzz: yea a lot of these idiomatic considerations hold for other languages
[02:26:19] <imakewebthings> svcghost: there isn't anything in jQuery library itself regarding selections, and i dont know any plugins personally
[02:26:37] <svcghost> no problem. my javascript is pretty good:) tanks
[02:31:47] <bl4ckcomb> hi, is there a way to make (1) work for my plugin? http://jsfiddle.net/mGQbA/
[02:33:09] <svcghost> Silly question, but is it easier to check if something exists, or does not exist
[02:33:11] <svcghost> lol
[02:33:25] <svcghost> easy I mean more efficient
[02:37:09] <imakewebthings> its usually just the difference between a ! or not
[02:37:24] <imakewebthings> but i like to reduce the number of negatives in code
[02:37:31] <imakewebthings> easier for others to read
[02:40:56] <ravenzz> bl4ckcomb the second example is the correct one
[02:42:53] <bl4ckcomb> ravenzz, I'm aware of that, but is there a way to make the first example work, or should I not make it work?
[02:43:36] <svcghost> Whats the best way to check if an object exists within an iframe
[02:43:43] <svcghost> using the .find() function?
[02:44:04] <ravenzz> you should create another 'plugin' in order to make it working
[02:44:28] <ravenzz> $.fn.myMethod = function(foo) { };
[02:45:32] <bl4ckcomb> ravenzz, I believe that plugin won't be able to access the variables that are in the first plugin's scope?
[02:46:12] <bl4ckcomb> I'll illustrate with a more complete example what I'm trying to accomplish
[02:46:21] <ravenzz> perhaps you could "share" the options, values of the 1st one with this one..but I am not really sure. I have really basic knowledge of OO javascript and jquery plugin development
[02:47:26] <JesperA> http://jsfiddle.net/GMcBC/ <--- Does anyone know why the "secondary" function only works when "primary" function has "return false", it doesnt work if i change to "return true"
[02:49:47] <ravenzz> ?prevenDefault @ JesperA
[02:49:48] <bot-t> JesperA, event.preventDefault() - If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[02:49:54] <ravenzz> instead of return false;
[02:51:46] <bl4ckcomb> ravenzz, http://jsfiddle.net/mGQbA/2/ <- this is what I'm trying to do, though I'm not sure whether it's following jQuery conventions
[02:52:14] <bl4ckcomb> I think the .data('key'[, $this]) is ugly
[02:53:59] <JesperA> Oh, cool, thanks ravenzz, cool, now i can get my links to work to, :P
[02:56:25] <ravenzz> yea
[02:56:28] <ravenzz> something like http://jsfiddle.net/4MM6H/
[03:07:44] <fotoflo> hey all, I'm playing with the youtube search API - it's a real messâ€¦ Does anyone here have experience with it?
[03:08:37] <ravenzz> me
[03:09:08] <ravenzz> mhm not with the new one, anyway that should be similar
[03:10:11] <fotoflo> ravenzz: is there a simple way to get a list of id's off the search results? the results object is WAY long and has so much nesting
[03:10:33] <fotoflo> ravenzz: or can you tell me that there is a method to this nesting madness
[03:11:21] <ravenzz> you need the video's id?
[03:11:36] <fotoflo> among other things.
[03:11:59] <ravenzz> do you know how to debug/read the docs? :p
[03:12:03] <fotoflo> the id appears to be in
[03:12:03] <fotoflo> results.feed.entry[0].id.$t
[03:12:04] <fotoflo> "tag:youtube.com,2008:video:wuEcLjbUS1E"
[03:12:36] <shal3r> is there any way to detect a block which is only partly visible because of parent's overlay:hidden ?
[03:12:39] <fotoflo> err
[03:13:02] <fotoflo> so results.feed.entry is a list of entries, and i go to entry 0 and can pull the id with a regex
[03:13:12] <fotoflo> or go to entry x and pull the id with a regex
[03:13:26] <fotoflo> but I'm wondering if there's a better way to do it?
[03:13:41] <ravenzz> wait are you using the ajax api, arent you?
[03:13:49] <fotoflo> yeah
[03:14:05] <ravenzz> well can you give me its url? I have the old one
[03:14:09] <fotoflo> query = 'http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos?start-index=1&max-results=1&v=2&alt=json&q='
[03:14:17] <fotoflo> http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/2.0/developers_guide_protocol.html#Searching_for_Videos
[03:14:42] <ravenzz> oh well that's the same
[03:14:45] <ravenzz> I used before
[03:14:48] <ravenzz> hold on
[03:22:08] <fotoflo> results.feed.entry[0].id.$t.match('[^:]+$')
[03:22:16] <fotoflo> thats how i am getting the id
[03:24:40] <ravenzz> fotoflo http://jsfiddle.net/HUBz8/
[03:25:05] <ravenzz> look at you firebug/dev tools console
[03:27:31] <fotoflo> looking
[03:27:33] <fotoflo> js fiddle is REALLY slow
[03:27:38] <ravenzz> oh
[03:28:08] <fotoflo> working though
[03:28:11] <fotoflo> these are feeds
[03:28:22] <fotoflo> or videos?
[03:28:40] <fotoflo> err nevermind
[03:28:52] <fotoflo> hold on i have more reading to do ;-)
[03:28:58] <ravenzz> eheh
[03:30:46] <fotoflo> whats jsonc
[03:30:46] <fotoflo> ?
[03:33:00] <ravenzz> http://apiblog.youtube.com/search/label/jsonc
[03:33:12] <ravenzz> http://code.google.com/intl/it-IT/apis/youtube/2.0/developers_guide_jsonc.html
[03:33:44] <fotoflo> ok, but thats not the big differnce
[03:33:50] <fotoflo> you seem to be getting back much more orderly results then me
[03:33:58] <fotoflo> trying find the diffence in the query
[03:34:31] <ravenzz> dunno man I followed the doc
[03:34:45] <ravenzz> how are you getting the results?
[03:35:22] <fotoflo> our queries look the smae
[03:36:06] <ravenzz> not really, so your alt parameter is setted to json
[03:36:12] <ravenzz> mine to jsonc
[03:36:47] <ravenzz> I haven't read the jsonc doc, but I would say that you are getting an json version of the XML feeds
[03:36:51] <fotoflo> i changed that
[03:36:53] <fotoflo> i get the same thing
[03:37:05] <ravenzz> and I am getting the json version of datas
[03:37:13] <ravenzz> no xml/feed stuffs
[03:37:21] <fotoflo> you have an aspectRatio and a category
[03:37:25] <fotoflo> for example
[03:37:51] <fotoflo> and i have a lot of different (less useful) variables
[03:38:12] <ravenzz> in order to understend the differences you should read the doc, at some point it will mention the differences i guess
[03:38:37] <fotoflo> ok
[03:39:05] <ravenzz> look at http://goo.gl/ (json) and http://goo.gl/LqztA (jsonc)
[03:39:12] <ravenzz> oh lol
[03:39:21] <ravenzz> http://goo.gl/dBb0F json
[03:39:30] <ravenzz> fail
[03:41:22] <bobdobbs> Is it a bad idea to explicity reset $(this) ?
[03:44:12] <crab> what do you mean?
[03:44:19] <bobdobbs> actually, that's a dumb question. Sorry.
[03:44:40] <bobdobbs> brain tangled
[03:55:58] <edgardo> is there a 'not' markup in jquery like in php for example: !empty (not empty) ?
[03:56:44] <aika>  hey
[04:00:54] <svcghost> Is there any way to use jQuery to get the content type of a page?
[04:01:05] <svcghost> e.g. javascript's document.contentType in Firefox
[04:07:47] <dabear> edgardo: thereis typeof foo != "undefined".
[04:08:50] <ravenzz> indeed the php empty function checks for more than one condition
[04:09:06] <ravenzz> false, '', null, 0 iirc
[04:10:16] <eMeL_> first test message
[04:14:28] <edgardo> http://jsfiddle.net/g2AXd/
[04:14:33] <edgardo> class experimenting :D
[04:16:10] <JmZ> hey
[04:16:55] <edgardo> eyyy
[04:16:55] <JmZ> how can i select elements which have a specified node as a child? for example, with xpath i can do '//div[span]' to select all divs with a span as a child
[04:37:37] <svcghost> You cannot get content type of a page in anything but Firefox? damn.. document.contentType.. jquery solution?
[04:44:55] <[Necris]Akasha> hi
[04:44:59] <[Necris]Akasha> how can i get last loaded element?
[04:45:11] <[Necris]Akasha> :last returns the element that is last on page at the moment
[04:45:14] <[Necris]Akasha> i use some ajax
[04:45:20] <[Necris]Akasha> and i need to access the latest loaded element
[04:45:27] <[Necris]Akasha> i.e. div.captcha:latest
[04:49:25] <ravenzz> [Necris]Akasha $(data).last(); within the success handler?
[04:53:10] <matadon> Can jQuery.on bind to HTML5 audio events?
[04:53:23] * matadon is trying to trigger an action on 'play' and 'ended', but no dice.
[04:58:45] <matadon> Ah, nevermind, I think I know what I was doing wrong â€” I need to attach events to the Audio object, not my playback DOM element.
[05:10:33] <zairakai> Hi everybody
[05:11:11] <zairakai> can you help me? I try to have a return true when my $.ajax succes but I have undefined.
[05:17:12] <Lichurec> Ciao ;]
[05:19:30] <bl4ckcomb> zairakai, can you show us what you did? http://jsfiddle.net
[05:21:44] <zairakai> ok I make that
[05:44:26] <SrPx> 6everytime I have a bug in my callback function called by jQuery.when, im getting wrong line numbers. all my code is inside that function because thats when document is ready. so what can i do
[06:11:16] <zulax> would it be possible to dynamically edit the <script src="file1.js"> using jquery?
[06:11:23] <zulax> or does it have to be done at the server
[06:11:41] <zulax> i want to change src to "file2.js" according to user selection
[06:12:48] <Lichurec> zulax:  if you want those scripts to be executed; you can simply build the script tag on userselect
[06:13:50] <zulax> Lichurec, so add the line to the head section?
[06:14:37] <Lichurec> yup
[06:16:06] <zulax> the problem is I would need to refresh the page to see the effect, but refreshing the page reverts whatever i added
[06:16:30] <bl4ckcomb> zulax, what about adding the line and calling a function in the file?
[06:17:09] <bl4ckcomb> zulax, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[06:17:10] <zulax> bl4ckcomb, ok, i will see if that works
[06:17:22] <Lichurec> zulax: no, you don'tâ€¦ just call tghe function
[06:17:29] <huglester> hello everyone. I wonder if I can use $('#tabs').tabs();, but I want to use 'styling' only.. so basicaly I would want to to full reload... is that somehow possible? because I can't find out a way to css/js objects so I would have static nav bar
[06:17:37] <zulax> thanks, that looks like what i need
[06:17:47] <huglester> I tried putting full url into href, but jqury tabs is replacign it with some default #ui-tab-1 values
[06:19:39] <bl4ckcomb> huglester, you can specify a tabTemplate option
[06:19:46] <bl4ckcomb> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tabs#option-tabTemplate
[06:20:37] <huglester> bl4ckcomb: thanks, looking into it now, will see if I'll be able to figure out
[06:21:57] <huglester> bl4ckcomb: the problem is that I want a page refresh, after loading the 2nd tab.. not sure if this option will go..
[06:22:31] <bl4ckcomb> after loading it? why would you do that?
[06:23:08] <bl4ckcomb> btw, you can override the create function too, to add custom behavior to the initialization
[06:23:37] <huglester> bl4ckcomb: I have complex tabs, and and after adding new data, I want refresh page2, which would be tab2
[06:23:59] <bl4ckcomb> oh the tab page
[06:24:14] <bl4ckcomb> I thought refreshing the whole page (which would result in an infinite loop)
[06:24:43] <bl4ckcomb> how are they complex? they contain iframes or what exactly?
[06:24:59] <bl4ckcomb> because you could dynamically load/refresh their content with ajax
[06:25:28] <edgardo> http://jsfiddle.net/ksZAu/ <-- I'm getting an unwanted 'r' after the name when I try to rename a folder. I think we know where it comes from hehe. Any ideas how to prevent it?
[06:25:37] <huglester> many inputs, flash uploaders, etc, don't wanna mess them up. so wanted to separate those tabs
[06:25:46] <edgardo> oh hi bl4ckcomb, you're here also :D
[06:25:54] <huglester> thougth I\d be able to use 'design only' from jquery UI , and make it work 'standalone' :)
[06:26:29] <bl4ckcomb> hi edgardo
[06:26:49] <bl4ckcomb> huglester, have you tried adding their classes?
[06:26:55] <bl4ckcomb> ui-tabs etc.
[06:27:05] <bl4ckcomb> they might style most of it
[06:27:15] <DaveMethvin> edgardo: call e.preventDefault() in the rename handler
[06:27:16] <bl4ckcomb> though, it won't give you the functionality of a tab control
[06:27:17] <Zogot> edgardo: http://jsfiddle.net/ksZAu/1/
[06:27:37] <Zogot> But you have another issue
[06:27:47] <Zogot> If someone presses r when they didn't finish the first rename
[06:27:55] <Zogot> you need to specify a number or so on the input
[06:27:58] <huglester> bl4ckcomb: I'm trying this one right now. copied the source via firebug and playing
[06:28:01] <Zogot> so the folder is attached to that ID
[06:28:35] <Zogot> Or to remove the other input is also possible
[06:29:01] <edgardo> oh yeah.. and adding r to the folder name erases everything also :D
[06:33:26] <zulax> how do i rerun my doc.ready function again?
[06:33:49] <bl4ckcomb> zulax, again? it's a one-time event
[06:33:56] <zulax> ok
[06:33:59] <discorpia> zulax: if you have that need it's probably better to put everything in a function, call that function in ready() and then again when needed
[06:34:04] <bl4ckcomb> just make a function then call that one from the event handler and make it available elsewhere
[06:34:11] <zulax> ok
[06:37:49] <cirzgamanti> hi, is there a way to select only objects that *only* contain a given string (contains() gets substrings)?
[06:42:07] <huglester> bl4ckcomb: thanks, works :)
[06:52:12] <Lichurec> cirzgamanti: see http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/#comment-50175019
[07:05:17] <_cb> if I do a $("#divid").load(htm.path) I don't get the images. Images are on the same folder as the htm. Any ideas?
[07:14:49] <edgardo> ok, so now I'm getting somewhere.. but there's still one thing I'm wondering about
[07:15:12] <edgardo> http://jsfiddle.net/e9Dvy/ <-- how can I make the save by mouseclick exclude the selected div with it's input field?
[07:16:24] <edgardo> I tried $('#wrapper:not(div.selected)') .. didn't work. ALso tried with CSS z-index, no go with that either
[07:18:19] <bittyx-laptop> hi. could someone take the time to explain the same-origin policy to me? it seems i don't understand exactly what it means. well, i sort of get the idea, but i don't see it working the way i thought it would. in my app, i issue a $.get('https://api.facebook.com/some-request') and i can see in firebug's console/net panel that the request is successfully sent, and the correct data is returned from the request. but according to my understanding of
[07:18:19] <bittyx-laptop>  the same-origin policy, this request shouldn't ever be sent?
[07:18:42] <edgardo> sry, my interweb broke. did you guys see my text? I didn't see any response (and now I don't know if anyone did respond hehe)
[07:25:25] <bittyx-laptop> edgardo: you should check the event target
[07:25:32] <bittyx-laptop> edgardo: in // SAVE WITH MOUSECLICK
[07:26:42] <bittyx-laptop> edgardo: do something like $('#wrapper').click(function(e) { if ( e.target == /* what you don't want */ ) return false; /* ... rest of the function as it is ... */ }
[07:28:06] <edgardo> ok, will test.. never worked with targets before hehe
[07:28:34] <Forbidd3n> Anyone else using the google jquery 1.4.4 api and their site isn't working?
[07:28:40] <bittyx-laptop> edgardo: http://api.jquery.com/event.target/
[07:29:49] <bittyx-laptop> edgardo: read something about event bubbling, it's very relevant to what you're trying to accomplish
[07:31:21] <edgardo> bittyx-laptop, doesn't seem to work
[07:31:28] <edgardo> I know.. very informative
[07:31:40] <edgardo> will fiddle with jsfiddle, just a sec
[07:33:09] <edgardo> http://jsfiddle.net/e9Dvy/2/
[07:34:22] <Forbidd3n> Anyone have any ideas? My site just stopped displaying. The source is there, but blank white page. If I remove the jquery api then it loads the page. Seems like something with jquery
[07:34:24] <edgardo> tried changing $('input') to $('div.selected') and $('#rename_'+foldernr)
[07:34:31] <edgardo> but to no avail
[07:34:37] <Forbidd3n> Anyone have any ideas on why this would be doing this?
[07:35:35] <Forbidd3n> There are no js errors at all
[07:36:15] <beWilled> when using datePicker, should I include something else than http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-1.7.min.js ?
[07:37:26] <edgardo> beWilled, I think you need the jquery ui for that also.. not sure though
[07:37:51] <edgardo> never used it, but remember reading about it.
[07:40:53] <bl4ckcomb> when creating a $.widget('namespace.widget', ... will the element where the widget is called upon automatically get a 'widget' or a 'namespace.widget' data() entry?
[07:46:56] <unclemantis> how long is the plugins section going to be down? Is there a read-only mirror that i can visit?
[07:55:18] <bl4ckcomb> unclemantis, http://goo.gl/L6kYO
[07:56:40] <unclemantis> bl4ckcomb real funny
[07:57:24] <bl4ckcomb> I thought it would be more creative than just answering 'no' :]
[07:59:42] <unclemantis> bl4ckcomb i haven't seen that page in ages
[08:00:21] <bl4ckcomb> you should visit it frequently, to get an idea of how small and limited our 1nterw3bz is
[08:03:42] <Forbidd3n> the page loads when I comment out this line.
[08:03:43] <Forbidd3n> return (context || rootjQuery).find( selector );
[08:03:48] <Forbidd3n> in 1.4.4
[08:05:20] <alexvandamns> hi
[08:06:03] <edgardo> yo
[08:06:10] <Forbidd3n> Anyone that can take a look at my site to see why it would stop displaying the page, please? The source is there, but no webpage displays.
[08:07:03] <ant-> whats the link
[08:07:31] <Forbidd3n> ppandu.com
[08:07:50] <Forbidd3n> you have to use a test var to see the problem I have it commented out
[08:07:58] <Forbidd3n> http://www.ppandu.com/en/index.php?test=1
[08:08:17] <Forbidd3n> It is from the jquery library
[08:08:23] <Forbidd3n> The page loads fine without it
[08:08:36] <alexvandamns> i have a little question. i will develop a simple ajax / jquery /php file uploader... the problem is, how i can the content form a input="file" field. for text input i can use $(input[type=text]).val(), but i have to use for file?
[08:08:36] <Forbidd3n> It worked fine yesterday, I woke up to it not working.
[08:09:12] <alexvandamns> how i get the content of a file-field^^
[08:09:41] <Forbidd3n> alexvandamns: so you are trying to get the text in the file field?
[08:10:12] <alexvandamns> no, the file it self
[08:10:27] <Forbidd3n> right the text that links to the file on the users computer
[08:10:29] <Forbidd3n> correct
[08:11:06] <Forbidd3n> ant-: see what I am speaking of?
[08:11:06] <alexvandamns> i only get the file name or the "fake"path.. this can't be enought
[08:11:34] <Forbidd3n> you mean when you upload it you are only getting the name of the file? that is all you get with php
[08:11:34] <alexvandamns> yes
[08:11:38] <Forbidd3n> not the full url
[08:11:39] <Forbidd3n> I believe this has been disabled with current browsers for security purposes.
[08:11:41] <ant-> yea
[08:11:59] <ant-> it looks like its stuck in a ;pp[
[08:12:00] <Forbidd3n> why would you need the entire path from the users computer
[08:12:04] <ant-> loop*
[08:12:07] <alexvandamns> yes
[08:12:28] <Forbidd3n> ant-: any ideas on what loop it might be stuck in?
[08:12:57] <Forbidd3n> I can't seem to find it. Nothing has changed on the site in weeks that is why it is confusing
[08:13:19] <beWilled> im doing this to add a datePicker $( "#datepicker1" ).datepicker(); but it adds with no theme. I already added a custom theme, how do I atach the theme to the widget?
[08:13:40] <Forbidd3n> ant-: If I comment out line 189 in jquery it works fine
[08:13:56] <ant-> beWilled: download a theme from jq ui
[08:14:14] <ant-> yeah but thats not the issue
[08:14:15] <Forbidd3n> beWilled: make sure you include the css to the theme and the ui api
[08:14:31] <Forbidd3n> ant-: yeah I know. anyway of telling where it is hanging at?
[08:14:44] <ant-> whats calling that jquery code
[08:14:45] <ohcibi> if have a try catch like this try { read.from.object; do_something_with_objects_value(); } catch(TypeError) {/* do nothing */} however the error is still uncaught then. if i add a return into the catch block it works out, but thats not what i want, how to deal do this right?
[08:14:56] <beWilled> Forbidd3n, where can I see an example of adding the css to the theme and the ui api?
[08:14:59] <ant-> Forbidd3n: http://jsfiddle.net/uchwd/
[08:15:27] <Forbidd3n> so it is erroring on the images rotating?
[08:15:37] <ant->  yeaÂ§
[08:15:48] <ant-> what you using
[08:15:55] <Forbidd3n> cycle plugin I think
[08:16:10] <ant-> i prefer jcarousel
[08:17:52] <alexvandamns> are any germans here? :)
[08:18:07] <beWilled> Forbidd3n, found it, thanks alot!
[08:18:14] <beWilled> :)
[08:21:53] <Forbidd3n> beWilled: np
[08:24:01] <alexvandamns> okay, other explaintation:
[08:24:02] <alexvandamns> Text fields can I with "$ (input [type = text]. val ()  read.
[08:24:02] <alexvandamns> But how can i file fields read? so that I do with php (via ajax)  eg" getimagesize ($ _FILES ['file'] ['tmp_name']);"?
[08:24:07] <alexvandamns> ...
[08:24:07] <alexvandamns> Text fields can I with "$ (input [type = text]. val ()  read.
[08:24:07] <alexvandamns> But how can i file fields read? so that I do with php (via ajax)  eg" getimagesize ($ _FILES ['file'] ['tmp_name']);"?
[08:24:23] <alexvandamns> sry 4 dc
[08:24:43] <Forbidd3n> ant-: that isn't it
[08:25:06] <Forbidd3n> I removed the plugin for that and still doesn't load. must be something else
[08:25:23] <dabear>  
[08:25:56] <Forbidd3n> what did you use to come to that conclusion?
[08:26:55] <Zeph88|Worrk> So I've got a mental block when it comes to dynamically adding rows to a form. I will need to make one of the fields auto complete, and have a hidden field that gets information from a popup. I guess my hurdle is that I don't understand how to reference the right cell/row on the newly added ones?
[08:27:42] <Zeph88|Worrk> Would I be better off having PHP generate like 100 rows and just reveal them?
[08:28:05] <Forbidd3n> Zeph88|Worrk: not sure I follow what your asking
[08:29:53] <Zeph88|Worrk> Forbidd3n: To boil it down I guess I'm asking how I can dynamically add rows to my form and then do things with those form fields generated? I don't understand how to reference them once made.
[08:29:55] <Forbidd3n> ant-: found it
[08:30:00] <ant-> Zeph88|Worrk: give it an id when you the row
[08:30:11] <ant-> you add*
[08:30:25] <Forbidd3n> you can set an id to it and store it
[08:30:25] <ant-> Forbidd3n: cool
[08:30:35] <Forbidd3n> ant-: it is the google translate
[08:30:39] <Forbidd3n> it is hanging there
[08:30:46] <ant-> ahh
[08:30:55] <Forbidd3n> if you look the code - $('body').hide();
[08:31:01] <Forbidd3n> then it translates then shows
[08:31:08] <Forbidd3n> it never completes the translate
[08:31:13] <Zeph88|Worrk> Oh okay, so I should not clone the row above, I should add the fields and set an ID?
[08:31:52] <Forbidd3n> Zeph88|Worrk:yep
[08:31:59] <ant-> use jquery(#id).append
[08:32:11] <Forbidd3n> Or what I do is create a default row in my code, and hide it and clone from that
[08:32:28] <Zeph88|Worrk> Would you have an example of what you mean?
[08:32:46] <Forbidd3n> that makes it easier than having to change out everything you did to the previous row you added
[08:33:01] <Forbidd3n> Zeph88|Worrk: example of what?
[08:33:10] <Forbidd3n> add the row or cloning the default row
[08:33:23] <Zeph88|Worrk> cloning
[08:33:32] <Forbidd3n> sec, I will jsfiddle somethign for you
[08:36:10] <Forbidd3n> Zeph88|Worrk: text field right?
[08:36:22] <ant-> Forbidd3n: $('body').hide(); just saw that  lol
[08:36:41] <Forbidd3n> ant-: that worked yesterday
[08:36:49] <Forbidd3n> not sure why it is not completing the translate
[08:36:58] <Forbidd3n> the translate works fine though
[08:37:05] <Forbidd3n> just jquery isn't showing it completed.
[08:37:12] <unclemantis> what is the best timepicker that you guys are solid on?
[08:37:19] <bencc> how do I force an html element created with jquery to render?
[08:37:34] <bencc> if I read it's size does it force it to render
[08:37:34] <ant-> tbh you should be translating before serving the page
[08:38:03] <Forbidd3n> ant-: I agree. I am redoing the entire site over.
[08:38:19] <ant-> cause translate is being used as a critical depenedency
[08:38:58] <Forbidd3n> Zeph88|Worrk?
[08:39:25] <ant-> you need a fallback then ;)
[08:39:44] <Forbidd3n> yeah lol
[08:40:02] <Forbidd3n> the site and company grew quickly
[08:40:16] <ant-> yeah
[08:40:56] <Mimoso98> Hi all
[08:40:57] <Forbidd3n> Zeph88|Worrk: you still there?
[08:42:12] <Mimoso98> Why .focus doesn't work after a alert? I check when a text is entered into an input, if not number (isNaN), I show a message (alert), and then I do a focus on the same field, but I've noticed that when the user presses TAB after entering the text to leave the input field, the focus doesn't work,
[08:43:26] <dabear> ?demo @ Mimoso98
[08:43:27] <bot-t> Mimoso98, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[08:44:40] <Mimoso98> it's very basic:
[08:44:41] <Mimoso98> 			if(!isNaN(value)){
[08:44:41] <Mimoso98> 				total(pr_number,number);
[08:44:41] <Mimoso98> 			}else{
[08:44:41] <Mimoso98> 				alert('Quantity must be a number');
[08:44:41] <Mimoso98> 				$(this).focus();
[08:44:43] <Mimoso98> 			}
[08:44:45] <Mimoso98> that's it
[08:45:24] <Mimoso98> all wrapped by this event:
[08:45:25] <Mimoso98> 		$('input.pr_formqty').change(function(){
[08:45:28] <Mimoso98> that's it
[08:45:44] <ant-> might need to be in a callback
[08:45:59] <Mimoso98> it works, but if I press the TAB key to produce the change event, I get the alert box but then the focus moves to the next input field
[08:46:38] <Mimoso98> a callback?
[08:46:51] <Mimoso98> somehow the TAB pressed event stays in memmory
[08:48:00] <ant-> yeah a callback is basically do this stuff and when it completes then do  the callback
[08:48:01] <Mimoso98> hello?
[08:48:11] <Mimoso98> I know, but how with the alert ?
[08:49:01] <Mimoso98> but I don't want the cursor to move to the next field if the current one is wrong, that is why I do the focus
[08:49:19] <adoven> Mimoso98: try a return false; after $(this).focus()
[08:49:35] <Mimoso98> I did :=
[08:49:37] <Mimoso98> nothing

[09:06:56] <craig_> Hello
[09:07:43] <craig_> I have something that seems super easy to fix but it's driving me nuts - can't find much googleing so I'll try to articulate it here
[09:09:04] <craig_> I have an app that loads json in a list based on parameters in the url - for instance "index.html?post_type=brew" - changeing post_type will load different sets of data
[09:10:04] <craig_> My problem is creating a link on another page to pass those parameters and load the JSON
[09:10:30] <craig_> I have this: <a href="index.html?post_type=brew">BREW</a>
[09:11:33] <edgardo> bittyx-laptop, I now know what the reason was why the target event didn't work
[09:11:45] <craig_> That loads the correct page, but it doesn't load my JSON url - however if I refresh, getJSON does load the correct JSON data
[09:12:04] <edgardo> it's because the input field was generated on the fly, and is not in the actual source code when you look at it
[09:12:43] <edgardo> now I need to bind a keypress to a live event to generate the input box, but not sure how :D
[09:13:59] <craig_> Inspecting with firebug I see the GET request is trying to get "index.html?post_type=brew" - where it should be loading "/json.php?post_type=brew"
[09:14:22] <craig_> I know this is a lot - any ideas?
[09:16:48] <Foxhoundz> Can anyone inform me as to why game.data would return an undefined? https://gist.github.com/1427598
[09:17:03] <Foxhoundz> and I know $.getJSON is returning data
[09:19:36] <craig_> Anyone? Let me know if I can elaborate further
[09:20:17] <Foxhoundz> The room is surprisngly quiet today
[09:21:27] <Zogot> That should work foxhoundz
[09:23:00] <Foxhoundz> it's not working for some reason. If I manually check the game object via firebug it returns perfectly fine
[09:23:23] <Foxhoundz> but it's returning undefined on line 11
[09:23:39] <_eagspoo> I'm having trouble finding documentation on the $.widget method from jquery.ui.  I can only find examples.
[09:23:54] <_eagspoo> anyone know where detailed docs exist for these lower level methods?
[09:25:36] <_cb> if I do a $("#divid").load(htm.path) I don't get the images. Images are on the same folder as the htm. Any ideas?
[09:26:24] <edgardo> yay, solved it \o/
[09:34:29] <Foxhoundz> I think I solved my problem
[09:35:27] <_cb> I can load a page a page by putting the url on the browser and it displays images. If I put that same url in $("#div").load the text is displayed but not the images. Images are in the same folder as the text. Any ideas on how can I solve the problem?
[09:40:40] <_eagspoo> _cb_afk: look at the content loaded into that div.  What are the uri to the images?  Sounds like your server his writing those uri differently for xhr
[09:49:41] <funkymonk> anyone here got coldfusion experience?
[09:50:12] <murosai> if i call $.getJSON and i get a data object for my callback function how can i check if the data is empty?
[09:56:55] <tfitts> does anyone know what I'd look for to have a function run when a phone gets scrolled to the bottom of the page?
[10:00:18] <asdf`> Uh, if i have an <input type=number max=42 />, how should i set the input's value to its max? Using .attr?
[10:01:28] <tfitts> .attr('value',$(this).attr('max'));
[10:02:08] <tfitts> or put the attr('max') in a variable beforehand.  I don't usually do it inline.
[10:03:37] <asdf`> Right, thanks.
[10:08:26] <Anime> what's the correct syntax for this:first-child?
[10:21:47] <yamahaalex37> whats this error in dev tools
[10:21:48] <yamahaalex37> $(document).ready(function(){
[10:21:48] <yamahaalex37> <yamahaalex37> default.js:1 Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLDocument> has no method 'ready'
[10:32:10] <bl4ckcomb> what am I missing here? http://jsfiddle.net/KbnCN/
[10:32:40] <bl4ckcomb> I believe I should use custom namespaces for widgets, since 'ui' is reserved for official jQuery widgets
[10:37:11] <bl4ckcomb> also, this doesn't seem to wok either: http://jsfiddle.net/KbnCN/1/
[11:09:17] <ohcibi> i have a form which i want to post via ajax, i do serialize the data by $('.allforminputs').serialize but i want to add some data to it, how to do that?
[11:14:48] <Foxhoundz> Does the .complete() function fire only after all xhr transactions are finished?
[11:17:53] <aldenie> Anyone got time for a noob question?
[11:18:41] <bot-t> aldenie, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:19:57] <aldenie> I'm trying to add an element to my page and give that new element the "click" attribute.
[11:20:23] <Foxhoundz> aldenie: onClick?
[11:20:34] <eddiemonge> on ? aldenie
[11:20:47] <Foxhoundz> aldenie: http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[11:20:51] <eddiemonge> aldenie api.jquery.com/on
[11:21:19] <Foxhoundz> bind is deprecated now?
[11:21:35] <aldenie> When the new element is something like "<div>" or "<div></div>", it works, but when it's "<div>sometext</div>" it doesn't.
[11:22:25] <ni-ka> hey folks, has anyone managed to run autoSuggest plugin (http://code.drewwilson.com/entry/autosuggest-jquery-plugin) with jQuery 1.7? Doesnt work here, gives me errors like $("#...").autoSuggest is not a function (but works with jQuery 1.4.2)
[11:22:30] <eddiemonge> no but on is the preferred method for event handling
[11:22:48] <eddiemonge> aldenie: post your code at jsfiddle so we know what you are doing
[11:23:07] <eddiemonge> ni-ka: it probably hasnt been updated
[11:24:01] <ni-ka> eddiemonge: Yeah, I guess so, has a lot changed? Its quite a small script (http://pastebin.com/h7FyDipt) and maybe its just a few lines?
[11:24:57] <ni-ka> eddiemonge: I mean it doesnt even give me errors within the functions... it does not find it at all
[11:24:59] <aldenie> Dang. Okay, give me a minute or two to read up on it. BRB.
[11:25:03] <eddiemonge> ni-ka: have you tried debugging it to see where its failing?
[11:25:55] <dafireball> hi guys, how can I make my own OOP classes within jQuery?
[11:26:10] <dafireball> do I need a plugin or is there standard functionality within the library?
[11:26:57] <ni-ka> eddiemonge: I wish I could debug but it does not find the method at all... maybe anything has changed in the way one has to register functions on a jquery element?
[11:27:09] <ni-ka> (or declare them)
[11:27:44] <eddiemonge> ni-ka: are you including the script? you arent really giving much to go on here
[11:27:56] <eddiemonge> dafireball: what is it you are trying to do?
[11:30:03] <aldenie> Okay, so here's my example: http://jsfiddle.net/2uYXv/
[11:30:32] <dafireball> eddiemonge: I want to create a "reservation" class which controls all my selections within the form etc. and updates the class properties, in the end I want to it to be submitted to the backend
[11:30:41] <dafireball> or should I just write my own plugin?
[11:31:07] <eddiemonge> you lost me
[11:31:13] <dafireball> lol
[11:31:17] <eddiemonge> you want to submit a form?
[11:31:17] <dafireball> :)
[11:31:48] <dafireball> no, I want to catch the events (ie a checkbox) which updates a property within my reservation class
[11:32:48] <aldenie> As I said before, the click attribute functions properly when the DIV I'm creating is empty, but if I add content inside the DIV it stops working. . . What am I missing?
[11:33:20] <eddiemonge> dafireball: why not mock it up as an exampe of what you want?
[11:33:44] <dafireball> sorry, have to go.. will talk later.. thanks!
[11:34:40] <aldenie> To clarify, I'd used DIV's previously, tried buttons just now. . .  Same issue.
[11:34:48] <eddiemonge> aldenie: http://jsfiddle.net/2uYXv/1/
[11:34:55] <ajpiano> ni-ka: nothing has changed wrt to how plugins are registered in 1.7
[11:37:26] <ni-ka> I just saw that I have two versions of jquery included by django...
[11:37:36] <aldenie> eddiemonge: okay, so I dig that I'm using an alert and that's probably not the "hip" thing. . .  But does anyone know why it doesn't work if the element I'm adding has content but does if it's empty?
[11:37:41] <ni-ka> so I'll have to see how to fix that ;-(
[11:38:52] <eddiemonge> aldenie: the example i gave does work
[11:40:35] <clockwize> hey guys, i have 3 values coming back from a getJSON, (ex. {tweets: 10, :messages: 2, :mentions: 0}) I have 3 labels which are one for each, I want the one with the highest value to be in a larger font size, and if there are 2 the same, the first one (meh?) ... how would I go about sorting the numbers and the elements at the same time
[11:41:42] <aldenie> eddiemonge: I know it does, and thank you for showing me that. . . I am still curious what causes my version (http://jsfiddle.net/2uYXv/3/) to have problems though.
[11:44:13] <eddiemonge> aldenie: maybe this will help you: http://jsfiddle.net/2uYXv/5/
[11:47:20] <aldenie> eddiemonge: Wow! Okay, so that totally works. . . Is it something to do with an order-of-operations issue maybe?
[11:47:31] <ajpiano> aldenie: i'm not sure a complex html string is supported for doing $("<tag>", props);
[11:47:56] <eddiemonge> thats kind of what i was hinting at
[11:48:15] <ajpiano> yeah
[11:48:16] <aldenie> Ah. . . Thanks to eddiemonge and ajpiano!
[11:48:23] <ajpiano> it doesn't pass the test for getting the prop handling
[11:48:45] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L121-123
[11:51:32] <bencc> is there a way to force a new element to render and get its size?
[11:51:36] <bencc> I'm creating a div with js and I need to make sure that the size is correct before I continue
[11:51:40] <bencc> I'm using setTimeout but there must be a way to do it without a timeout
[11:54:14] <bl4ckcomb> bencc, $('<div></div>').appendTo(...).width();
[11:55:07] <bencc> bl4ckcomb: thanks
[12:09:22] <walid> hi all!
[12:10:32] <walid> i have a real weird behaviour on smth.. i use $('.buy').hover(function(){ $(this).children().fadeToggle(); });
[12:10:56] <walid> if i use fadeIn() it works, but it says the object has no method fadeToggle()...
[12:10:59] <walid> any clue?
[12:11:38] <crab> jquery too old for fadeToggle?
[12:12:02] <walid> crab:  i'm on last version.
[12:12:06] <walid> latest*
[12:12:56] <ravenzz> demo?
[12:13:26] <foRei> Hey, how would I go about selecting the three elements in the following content: <li><div></div><a>hihi</a><div></div></li>
[12:13:34] <foRei> I want to add a seperate class to each of them
[12:13:46] <foRei> with .css('class','hihihiihih')
[12:13:51] <walid> ravenzz: ?
[12:14:23] <walid> foRei: either give each of them a class
[12:14:52] <walid> or do smth like $(li.div:first).addClass('aasdasd')
[12:15:59] <foRei> The li's are inside a 'ul' with the id #mts, could I make it more specific using: $(#mts.li.div:first).css('class','hihihiih'); ?
[12:16:10] <bl4ckcomb> ravenzz, for my problem earlier I found out I can use $.widget. this does the .data('...', $this) thing in the background, so the ugliness is gone from my own code :]
[12:16:11] <ravenzz> foRei http://pastie.org/2961315
[12:16:33] <ravenzz> walid can you provide a demo?
[12:16:47] <walid> foRei: yes probably
[12:16:49] <bl4ckcomb> foRei, . is a class selector > is a child selector
[12:17:11] <ravenzz> I miss some DOTS
[12:17:39] <walid> ravenzz: site is under construction, let me set up a fiddle (if it works there then it's smth in my env... :/
[12:17:40] <foRei> kk, I'll try some of the suggestions. Thx =)
[12:18:39] <ravenzz> bl4ckcomb I joined the channel right now, I don't know what are you talking about
[12:20:46] <walid> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/SePYs/
[12:20:49] <walid> this works.
[12:20:59] <walid> now if you go on www.moijconnais.com
[12:21:36] <ravenzz> ..
[12:21:44] <ravenzz> it doesn't work, anyway that is logic
[12:21:48] <walid> ravenzz:  run this: $('#under-construction').hide()
[12:21:55] <ravenzz> because it will hide <div> Buy </div>  as well
[12:22:14] <ravenzz> no wait
[12:22:23] <ravenzz> forget about that
[12:22:48] <walid> and then http://moijconnais.com/#BackalaMaisonHomegoing
[12:22:55] <walid> you have a 'Buy' div.
[12:23:14] <walid> ravenzz: run this to bind the hover event:
[12:23:14] <walid> $('.buy').hover(function(){ $(this).children().fadeToggle(); });
[12:23:20] <walid> and you'll see the error
[12:23:23] <walid> (phew)
[12:24:06] <foRei> Hmm, I tried: $(li.div).css('class', 'inactivenotab'); - Is that not suppose to set the class of all divs inside a <li> to inactivenotab?
[12:24:18] <ravenzz> ...
[12:24:24] <ravenzz> ?addClass @ foRei
[12:24:24] <bot-t> foRei, .addClass(className): Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[12:24:43] <foRei> I dont want to add, I want to override existing classes
[12:24:50] <foRei> But i'll read, thx =)
[12:24:54] <ravenzz> toggleClass
[12:25:35] <Danielss89> Hi.. I have a tag <div><span>hello</span></div> and then i have a mouseover on the div, but when the mouse hovers the span inside the div, its like a mouse out event is called on the div..
[12:26:10] <walid> ravenzz: any clue?
[12:26:23] <ravenzz> walid ..
[12:26:36] <ravenzz> there is a layer over the page
[12:26:39] <ravenzz> is that normal?
[12:26:40] <mansoor-s> Danielss89, thats right, events bubble up to parents
[12:26:52] <Danielss89> how can fix this xD?
[12:27:12] <walid> yep just execute
[12:27:17] <walid> ravenzz:  run this: $('#under-construction').hide()
[12:27:28] <eddiemonge> Danielss89: use mouseenter and mouseleave
[12:27:40] <mansoor-s> Danielss89, rethink your strategy
[12:27:46] <Danielss89> eddiemonge: that didn't work either :(
[12:27:58] <Danielss89> mansoor-s: what would the right strategy be?
[12:27:58] <eddiemonge> Danielss89: paste your example at jsfiddle
[12:28:13] <bl4ckcomb> can anyone tell me how I should correctly use namespaces for widgets? http://jsfiddle.net/KbnCN/2/ <- this doesn't seem to work
[12:28:31] <Danielss89> can i pm you eddiemonge
[12:28:32] <ravenzz> walid i got it
[12:28:36] <Danielss89> with a link?
[12:28:43] <mansoor-s> Danielss89, i don't know what your application is or how it works :)
[12:28:43] <walid> ravenzz: (y)
[12:28:58] <Danielss89> can i pm you mansoor-s ?
[12:29:08] <mansoor-s> sure
[12:29:30] <ravenzz> walid before to continue, you can do that by css
[12:29:36] <ravenzz> (3)
[12:29:45] <walid> ravenzz: you're so right.
[12:30:05] <walid> i'll implement that.
[12:30:12] <walid> i need to set transitions, right?
[12:30:25] <walid> not too familiar to that, good opportunity
[12:30:41] <ravenzz> yes
[12:30:57] <eddiemonge> Danielss89: seems fine to me http://jsfiddle.net/YqB5C/
[12:33:39] <foRei> I know im close: $("#mts").children("li").children("div").addClass('inactivenotab').removeClass('activetabright').removeClass('activetableft');
[12:34:02] <ravenzz> walid you should iterate each element in order to call fadeToggle() i guess
[12:34:04] <foRei> I want to match all li's inside <ul id="mts"> and set all divs inside those <li>'s to the following
[12:34:08] <foRei> What am I missing?
[12:34:36] <walid> ravenzz: hm. maybe. but css is obviously more appropriate, isn't it?
[12:34:37] <ravenzz> no
[12:35:01] <ravenzz> yes it is, but it is not going to work on non css3 compliant browsers
[12:36:04] <danzik17> foRei: $( "#mts > li > div" ).removeClass().addClass( "inactivenotab" )
[12:36:56] <walid> ravenzz: true that.
[12:37:00] <eddiemonge> foRei: all divs in the lis or only immediate children?
[12:37:06] <walid> but there's not so many of these, are they?
[12:37:10] <foRei> ah thx danzik17 =)
[12:37:25] <foRei> eddict immediate children but danzik17 solved it =)
[12:37:30] <foRei> eddiemonge*
[12:40:50] <foRei> And final thingy for today: Im calling a function with (this) from a href. Is it possible to select the tag before and after 'this' ? Example: <div></div> <a href="function(this);"> </a><div></div>. I want to select the divs and assign a seperate class to each of them
[12:41:28] <Danielss89> Hmm eddiemonge thats weird..
[12:42:36] <eddiemonge> foRei: dont do inline functions
[12:42:58] <foRei> Whats the alternative?
[12:43:15] <foRei> oh it wasnt a href, I used onclick :P
[12:44:26] <nickaugust> is there a mirror of the plugins site?  (its down)
[12:44:30] <eddiemonge> Danielss89: why are you using 1.6.2? can you upgrade?
[12:44:37] <Danielss89> yes
[12:44:38] <eddiemonge> foRei: same thing.
[12:44:39] <Danielss89> one sec
[12:44:48] <foRei> eddiemonge whats the better way of doing it?
[12:44:56] <eddiemonge> foRei: bind to it in your js file
[12:45:21] <foRei> ic
[12:46:43] <eddiemonge> Danielss89: your css should go before your js
[12:47:22] <Danielss89> eddiemonge: ok. one sec. The query version is now 1.7.1
[12:47:59] <Danielss89> css is now before js
[12:48:26] <eddiemonge> you need to simplify, there is too much to go through
[12:49:00] <Danielss89> can you see the error
[12:49:01] <Danielss89> ?
[12:50:16] <Danielss89> eddiemonge: line 580 in calendarXMP.js is the function
[12:51:13] <foRei> Im trying to get the parent of 'this' and find all the divs inside that parent. What am I doing wrong: $(this).parent().find("div").removeClass().addClass("activetabright"); ?
[12:52:00] <Segaja> foRei: looks okay
[12:52:36] <foRei> Hmm :\
[12:54:24] <foRei> ah I wrote this instead of the value I send to my function, works now =) thx everyone!
[12:54:27] <Zogot> foRei you didn't specify a class to remove from the removeClass?
[12:55:04] <foRei> Zogot: No I just want it to remove all classes and add one specific
[12:55:30] <Zogot> Fair enough :)
[12:55:42] <Danielss89> eddiemonge: why would it work with your example, but not in my code? :S
[12:59:34] <eddiemonge> Danielss89: is the span a display block?
[13:00:10] <Danielss89> it's just a plain <span> tag so the default(which i don't know what is) :D
[13:01:29] <Danielss89> eddiemonge: just set it to display block, and now it "blinks" all the time.. no matter where your mouse is in the div

[13:05:28] <eddiemonge> Danielss89: i was saying it shouldnt do that. try using hover instead
[13:05:54] <Danielss89> that doesn't change anything eddiemonge
[13:06:19] <gataraid> http://pastebin.com/enbusAe0 - Why doesn't this work in IE, Chrome, or Safari
[13:06:28] <eddiemonge> are you creating the span in the mousemove?
[13:06:30] <gataraid> FF it works fine
[13:10:47] <Engin> hey guys, is there a (obviously cross browser) resizeable round corner panel solution ?
[13:10:54] <Engin> i can code it up but it is so damn tedious
[13:11:14] <Engin> i rather put a fish in my ass
[13:11:25] <abjorn> thats...lovely
[13:11:41] <Engin> isn't it.
[13:11:43] <abjorn> well, css rounded corners more or less work across all the "modern" browsers
[13:11:48] <abjorn> other than that..lol gl
[13:12:15] <gataraid> yea
[13:12:15] <Engin> but my panels are very nice looking
[13:12:20] <gataraid> Engin hold on
[13:12:22] <Engin> with all the drop shadows etc
[13:12:34] <Engin> i want a consistent look in all browsers
[13:12:49] <Engin> so the key is to segment it into corners, and edges
[13:12:54] <Engin> it is a very tedious thing
[13:13:01] <gataraid> I wish I could find it
[13:13:33] <Engin> you coudlN't ?!
[13:13:54] <gataraid> I'm still looking sorry
[13:14:24] <gataraid> Oh
[13:14:26] <gataraid> http://jquery.malsup.com/corner/
[13:15:22] <Engin> ah know this one, won't do it, it needs to be skinnable
[13:16:46] <ockham_> hi, can someone tell me what's wrong with my animation in http://jsfiddle.net/y6muQ/5/
[13:16:49] <ockham_> ?
[13:17:05] <ockham_> the one that's attached to kwicks.eq(o.defaultKwick) upon mouseleave
[13:17:19] <ockham_> seems it's only called for the start value
[13:17:58] <ockham_> *and* the loop inside that's supposed to loop through all (five) "kwicks" only assumes values 0 and 1.
[13:20:09] <HGtronic> hello o/
[13:22:17] <ockham_> anyone?
[13:23:08] <Eviltwin> Hi, just got here
[13:23:11] <Eviltwin> What are the problems?
[13:23:19] <HGtronic> can some one help to understand how to crate a simple dialog window
[13:23:39] <Eviltwin> HGtronic: Have you looked at jQuery UI Dialog?
[13:23:46] <HGtronic> yes
[13:24:02] <HGtronic> but its so dificult i dont understand
[13:24:05] <HGtronic> :s
[13:24:17] <clockwize> how do i sort an array of objects based on a property of each object?
[13:25:07] <Eviltwin> clockwize: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[13:26:26] <clockwize> Hmm, i don't give js enough credit -_-
[13:29:42] <HGtronic> can some one give me a full code of a dialog box i dont know where i must type anything :s
[13:30:03] <igcewieling> I'm a n00b, is there anything syntactically wrong with this line? $('#route_edit form').not('#route_edit form .did, #route_edit form .static').addClass('disabled');
[13:30:42] <HGtronic> http://www.erepublik.com/en i want to make something like this if some on sign up its shows  a window pls help
[13:31:05] <ajpiano> igcewieling: all form elements are inherently not elements inside of themselves.
[13:31:18] <ajpiano> igcewieling: what are you trying to do, get rid of forms with a particular class?
[13:31:52] <HGtronic> yes something like that
[13:32:06] <Eviltwin> HGtronic: Did you look at the demos?
[13:32:12] <HGtronic> want to show this pic on ceentre of screen
[13:32:20] <igcewieling> I have a select drop down.  Selection "DID" should disable all elements which are not in the class "did" and not in the class "static"
[13:32:21] <HGtronic> yeah but i dont understand
[13:32:36] <Eviltwin> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#modal
[13:34:03] <igcewieling> The thing to remember with most data entry people is that if a field can have data input, then someone will input data into that field, even ones which are not logical or impossible.  I'm trying to grey out text and disable input fields depending on which "type" is selected in the drop down.
[13:34:16] <Eviltwin> HGtronic: It gives you the source for how to pull up the modal
[13:34:28] <ajpiano> igcewieling: do you mean 'in' the class static or 'have' the class static
[13:34:41] <ajpiano> typically 'in' in the dom means "is a descendant of',
[13:34:46] <clockwize> is there something better than linqjs?
[13:35:16] <ajpiano> igcewieling: i think you just need $("#route_edit form").find(".static,.did").addClass("disabled"
[13:35:18] <ajpiano> )
[13:35:25] <igcewieling> ajpiano: not "descendant of" I'm looking for "is a member of class x"
[13:35:26] <ajpiano> igcewieling: i think you are using .not
[13:35:28] <clockwize> more jquery-esque
[13:35:32] <ajpiano> wrong,
[13:35:35] <ajpiano> thinking it does something else
[13:35:46] <yamahaalex37> $(document).ready(function(){
[13:35:47] <yamahaalex37> default.js:1 Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object DOMWindow] is not a function
[13:35:52] <yamahaalex37> whats that error mean
[13:36:03] <ajpiano> yamahaalex37: it means jquery is not included properly when you are attempting to use it
[13:36:03] <igcewieling> ajpiano: I'll give find a try.  I'm wary of things like find, afraid they will be slow.
[13:36:08] <ajpiano> lol igcewieling
[13:36:21] <HGtronic> can some one give me a good link on yt to wath how it makes
[13:36:22] <ajpiano> what you need is "perspective on performance"
[13:36:49] <igcewieling> I'm much better at PHP, but for this kind of thing, JS and jQuery is the right solution.
[13:37:58] <igcewieling> ajpiano: my perspective is usually "web browsers and browser based 'apps' are way too slow"  I understand your point about perspective, however.
[13:38:19] <ajpiano> igcewieling: saying 'i'm afraid x will be slow' when 'x is the thing you need'
[13:39:04] <Ganymede> Hello. I'm interesting in using the datepicker from UI, however, instead of supplying a callback when a date is selected, I'd like to make each date an <a> tag with a formulaic href tag (such as href="something.php?date=2011/10/19") and otherwise act as normal links. Is this doable?
[13:39:07] <ajpiano> and the code you wrote says "get me all forms, then get rid of the forms that match the criteria of being elements with a particular class *inside* of that form, and then add a class to all the forms that weren't filtered" you need to focus on writing the appropriate code to accomplish the task
[13:39:15] <ajpiano> not preemptively worry about nonexistent performance concerns
[13:40:10] <yamahaalex37> ajpianom can you help me know why that is?
[13:40:14] <yamahaalex37> the jquery file has no errors
[13:40:14] <yamahaalex37> http://dev.eternaware.com/index.php/software
[13:40:29] <igcewieling> ajpiano:  $("#route_edit form").find(".static,.did").addClass("disabled"); this seems to do the opposite of what I want.  I want to add class "disabled" to any elements which do not have the class .static or .did.
[13:40:49] <ajpiano> igcewieling: .find(":input").not(".static,.did")
[13:40:58] <ajpiano> or .find("input,select").not..
[13:41:02] <ajpiano> if you're worried about perf :)
[13:41:17] <igcewieling> *nod*  I'll give the find/not combo a try.
[13:42:04] <yamahaalex37> if you dev tools my resources, you see red ! on all my .js files
[13:42:36] <gataraid> $("#attachfile").triggerHandler("click");
[13:43:02] <gataraid> how do I use the triggerHandler to activate the click event?
[13:43:43] <gataraid> I'm trying to simulate the clicking of another element by clicking an element
[13:44:12] <Eviltwin> gataraid: Is there a reason you're not using .trigger("click")
[13:44:24] <igcewieling> I want to find all elements in #route_edit form which are not the class .static and not class .did.
[13:44:45] <Eviltwin> igcewieling: All of them?
[13:44:51] <igcewieling> would that be something like $('#route_edit form').find('*').not('.static, .did').addClass('disabled');
[13:45:19] <Eviltwin> Not like all input tags that don't have that class?
[13:45:21] <igcewieling> Eviltwin: I'm pretty sure all of them.
[13:45:42] <gataraid> I thought I read .trigger submitted the form
[13:45:45] <gataraid> or the parent element
[13:45:46] <gataraid> or something
[13:45:46] <igcewieling> spans, divs, etc.  I also wants to add the disabled class to text.
[13:45:57] <gataraid> and it was best to use the triggerHandler
[13:46:01] <yamahaalex37> I am confused. there is nothing wrong with my include. jquery is found. what could be wrong?
[13:46:25] <Eviltwin> yamahaalex37: Without seeing code it's pretty much impossible for us to tell you
[13:46:34] <igcewieling> Eviltwin: all the elements I want to stay enabled have a .static or .did class.
[13:46:50] <gataraid> It works in FF but for some reason it's not in the other browsers
[13:46:51] <yamahaalex37> what code? in web dev tools you can see jquery is foudn, but all .js files using jquery have red !
[13:46:54] <gataraid> I don't understand why
[13:46:59] <yamahaalex37> isnt there some jquery no conflict rule I can adD?
[13:47:02] <gataraid> http://www.exactprecisions.com/WORK/ErwinTheme/
[13:47:23] <ajpiano> gataraid: are you trying to trigger a click on an input type="file"
[13:47:51] <Eviltwin> yamahaalex37: noConflict does the opposite of what you want
[13:47:55] <gataraid> Yes
[13:48:02] <yamahaalex37> hmm
[13:48:03] <gataraid> ajpiano yes sir
[13:48:10] <ajpiano> gataraid: you can't do that, it's not allowed by most browsers
[13:48:11] <yamahaalex37> can i try using jquery. instead of $.
[13:51:09] <antnash> Hey guys. Could you have a look at this and let me know what I'm doing wrong, please?  http://pastebin.com/4i5EcLh2
[13:51:10] <ajpiano> yamahaalex37: you can try it, but it probably won't work any better if jQuery isn't loaded to begin with
[13:51:36] <Eviltwin> antnash: First, I highly suggest you don't use .live
[13:51:48] <Eviltwin> And use .on if you're using jQuery 1.7+ or .delegate if not
[13:51:58] <yamahaalex37> it is loading find i believe ajpiano, i can see it in web dev tools. its just all the other .js using jquery throw an wrror
[13:51:59] <yamahaalex37> error
[13:52:38] <pringlescan> I have a question, it may require some clarifcation. I'm using something called automodal with Drupal. By adding the class automodal, any link then opens in a popup window. It works as desired, except when I print a link from AJAX. I know I need to recall automodal, since Jquery's default document ready code has already fun. Would I overide .ajaxComplete() to do this?
[13:54:05] <antnash> Eviltwin: oh. Fair enough. so $(.class).on({ mouseenter:function(){ ?
[13:54:47] <Eviltwin> antnash: It would actually be $(document).on({mouseenter...},"#sabnzbd .speed_input")
[13:54:59] <yamahaalex37> replacing $ with jquery fixed it
[13:55:03] <yamahaalex37> i just wish i knew why
[13:55:27] <Eviltwin> antnash: But the problem is actually with this
[13:55:30] <Eviltwin> "this"
[13:56:24] <antnash> Eviltwin: Right. What should I be doing?
[13:56:25] <someprimetime> should i use a class to target an event like voting on a submission with an arrow, or use the onclick="" method instead?
[13:56:34] <danzik17> yamahaalex37: Because you are:  A.  Calling $.noConflict.   B.  Overwriting the $ variable yourself.  C.  Including another library that doesn't play nicely with others that also use $.
[13:56:36] <someprimetime> like onclick="vote(id)" or whatever
[13:57:29] <yamahaalex37> danzik17, futrunately someone in #js had a good eye
[13:57:46] <yamahaalex37> one of my components decided to call google jquery, and i manually called it
[13:58:00] <yamahaalex37> i guess calling jquery twice breaks laws of the universe
[13:58:49] <Eviltwin> antnash: You need to do one of these: http://pastebin.com/5EDYUc3U
[13:59:26] <antnash> Eviltwin: $.get(url, function(data) { $('.textboxclass').val(data) }) ?
[14:00:02] <Eviltwin> antnash: That will replace the value of everything with class textboxclass with the data
[14:00:09] <Eviltwin> Which I'm not sure is what you want
[14:00:13] <Eviltwin> Perhaps it is
[14:00:20] <antnash> No, that was just an example
[14:03:18] <pringlescan> I need to call Jquery from AJAX... Should I overide .ajaxComplete() and put the code I need to run after AJAX in there? I just need to reapply something that runs when the page is done loading.
[14:04:58] <gataraid> I got is ajpiano
[14:05:16] <gataraid> using a js library called .SI-FILES-STYLIZED
[14:05:50] <gataraid> http://www.exactprecisions.com/WORK/ErwinTheme/
[14:05:51] <gataraid> :D
[14:08:27] <antnash> Eviltwin: I am right in thinking that in $.get('/xhr/sabnzbd/get_maxspeed', function(data).....   data will be the return value of the function defined at /xhr/sabnzbd/get_maxspeed   right?
[14:10:31] <Eviltwin> Try visiting the URL
[14:10:34] <Eviltwin> What do you see?
[14:10:58] <antnash> how do I visit the url?
[14:11:05] <Eviltwin> Um
[14:11:09] <Eviltwin> There's a bar in web browsers
[14:11:10] <antnash> Sorry
[14:11:14] <Eviltwin> Called the URL bar
[14:11:31] <Eviltwin> You can type in it to visit a website
[14:11:36] <antnash> Right, I'm not a complete tard! lol
[14:12:04] <antnash> So it's just ip:port/xhr/sabnzbd/get_maxspeed?
[14:12:23] <Eviltwin> Sure
[14:12:35] <antnash> oh yeah! And it's correct
[14:12:58] <antnash> But it's still not setting the value of the textbox
[14:14:32] <aro> how come this won't work? : $('#ImageHashMzdlMjc1MmUwMjA3Y2RjOWMwN2ZjNWIxODhjMzU0OTJjNTVkMjg4ZTIzNjRjYWViZmEyNDRiNjg5YWZiNTQwZQ==').remove();
[14:15:22] <Morteza_ipo> hi
[14:17:43] <Eviltwin> antnash: http://jsfiddle.net/a9NYX/
[14:20:07] <antnash> Eviltwin: I'd love it if my SABnzbd went at 1200mph.
[14:26:42] <edgardo> how can I return the selected text from a textarea to jquery?
[14:27:51] <edgardo> http://jsfiddle.net/vr9jL/2/ <-- I now have that, but I just want to get the text that is actually selected
[14:30:52] <Tatsh> is there a way to get a prefixed CSS property?
[14:31:05] <Tatsh> want to read $el.css('-webkit-animation')
[14:31:18] <Tatsh> and it always returns undefined
[14:33:51] <pringlescan> Is there a way to call the .ready function again? For example, after I send an AJAX response, I need to run the functions in .ready again
[14:34:03] <Eviltwin> Tatsh: I think you need to access the individual properties
[14:34:33] <Tatsh> Eviltwin, i was hoping desparately to read such a property in IE since IE doesn't support the property but I want to read the time from the CSS property
[14:34:51] <Tatsh> that way i can update the CSS and the JS stays up-to-date without manually updating
[14:35:08] <Tatsh> but even $el.css('top') returns undefined in IE7
[14:36:03] <ajpiano> Tatsh: http://ryanflorence.com/cssanimation/?jquery might be somehow useful
[14:36:07] <ajpiano> either as a tool or to look at its source
[14:38:34] <kanja> can jquery ajax handle urls with ; in them?
[14:39:57] <Eviltwin> kanja: I believe so
[14:40:07] <kanja> I'm getting strange behavior
[14:41:42] <whatthepoop_> anyone know off-hand if .height() will get the height of an element that has a declared 'min-height' but *not* a explicitly-declared 'height' in the static css file? seems to work that way, but not sure how reliable/legit it is...
[14:42:00] <ajpiano> whatthepoop_: height() gets the computed height of the element
[14:42:46] <whatthepoop_> ajpiano: ah, duh, thanks, the docs clearly say "computed height".. thanks
[14:44:26] <antnash> Eviltwin: For some reason it's still not working for me. Even if I just try to set the value with a click, nothing happens
[14:44:47] <Eviltwin> antnash: Can you show the problem code?
[14:45:27] <antnash> I'll paste the whole html and py files and the whole SAB section of the js file.
[14:45:41] <Eviltwin> Well the PYs don't really do me any good
[14:45:53] <Eviltwin> Also
[14:45:55] <igcewieling> Would this add the disabled class to any elements contained in the #route_edit form?  $('#route_edit form').siblings().addClass('disabled');
[14:45:57] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ antnash
[14:45:57] <bot-t> antnash, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[14:46:17] <antnash> cool
[14:46:26] <Eviltwin> igcewieling: $('#route_edit form').children().addClass('disabled');
[14:46:43] <antnash> Well it's the same problem code as before. I'll repaste
[14:47:07] <Eviltwin> I showed you what you needed to change
[14:47:34] <dogarrhea2> ok i've had it with jqueryui
[14:47:34] <antnash> Yeah, I did that
[14:47:42] <dogarrhea2> time to rip it all out and start over with something else
[14:47:48] <igcewieling> Eviltwin: thanks!  is there a good explanation on the differences, or should I read the docs for both?
[14:47:50] <dogarrhea2> apparently a lot of people agree
[14:47:52] <dogarrhea2> http://amplicate.com/hate/jqueryui
[14:48:16] <antnash> Eviltwin: I know for a fact that it's not the python that's the problem, and I know that the url for the function works fine.
[14:48:17] <Eviltwin> igcewieling: The docs are really, really, really clear
[14:49:06] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: Make a better one
[14:49:18] <Tatsh> dang i got excited
[14:49:25] <Tatsh> i saw csstransforms added by Modernizr in IE 9
[14:49:28] <Tatsh> then i saw no-cssanimation
[14:49:31] <Tatsh> :/
[14:52:37] <antnash> Eviltwin: http://pastebin.com/68a8BJdC
[14:52:46] <antnash> That's where the issue is arising
[14:53:02] <Eviltwin> antnash: Are you using Firebug or something?
[14:53:38] <Eviltwin> Well...there's one obvious problem
[14:53:38] <antnash> Nope. Why?
[14:53:48] <antnash> oh. There is?
[14:54:09] <Eviltwin> #sabnzbd .inner .speed_input
[14:54:40] <antnash> jesus
[14:54:50] <Eviltwin> I don't see anything in the HTML with a class speed_input
[14:55:05] <Eviltwin> This is where a lot of people get burned with jQuery
[14:55:33] <Eviltwin> $("#element_that_doesnt_exist").click(function(){...}) won't throw an error
[14:55:44] <Eviltwin> Or anything like that
[14:56:15] <Eviltwin> Because jQuery doesn't consider it a failure
[14:56:29] <antnash> Boy do I feel like a fool
[14:56:47] <hightekvagabond> yeah, why would it be an errorâ€¦. when you loop on an array of length zero the loop doesn't goâ€¦.
[14:56:49] <pringlescan> what's the best tool to watch javascript execution occuring so I can find out where something is happening? the site I'm working on has about 20 seperate .js files and tons of AJAX so I'm just scratching my head now.
[14:57:15] <Eviltwin> hightekvagabond: Yes but var elem = document.getElementById('element_that_doesnt_exist'); elem.addEventListener(...) is a failue
[14:57:18] <Eviltwin> failure*
[14:57:22] <pringlescan> Eviltwin, that's what's so awesome about Jquery, you don't need a ton of conditionals in your code :-)
[14:57:28] <Eviltwin> So a lot of people expect that same behavior
[14:57:43] <Eviltwin> pringlescan: I know but it burns everyone at least once when they don't expect a collection to be empty
[14:58:17] <pringlescan> I expect everything to go wrong, I may just have been screwing up longer than you. If I expect anything without checking it, it comes back to bite me in the ass.
[14:59:46] <antnash> pringlescan: My problem is that this is the first time I'm doing any jquery/js/html/python coding. And I've only ever done a little bit of C# before.
[15:00:06] <Eviltwin> Yeah, you should probably read up on JavaScript then jQuery
[15:00:13] <pringlescan> Oh well you're going from strict to relaxed, it's totally different.
[15:00:31] <antnash> I hate the reading bit. So boring!
[15:00:43] <antnash> I wanna see things do stuff
[15:00:52] <pringlescan> antnash, read JQury from novice to ninja
[15:00:56] <pringlescan> *Jquery, it's not too boring.
[15:01:16] <pringlescan> The Head First series is very good if you like working through examples and getting right into things.
[15:01:38] <antnash> Yeah, I started one of those for C#
[15:02:09] <pringlescan> I wish I could help myself, I can't figure out what is doing what on a Drupal site with 15,000 lines of custom code, written in someone who's native language isn't english.
[15:02:35] <antnash> Now that sounds painful
[15:02:40] <Tatsh> drupal is the problem there :P
[15:03:40] <pringlescan> It was work 80 hours a week as a cashier, or program on a Drupal site. I still don't know which is worse.
[15:04:04] <Eviltwin> Cashiering is...fun
[15:04:24] <antnash> Bagging is better
[15:04:40] <Eviltwin> WTF?
[15:04:43] <Eviltwin> "Joan [sex@wikipedia/MZMcBride] has quit"
[15:04:48] <pringlescan> It sucks, I'm a full-time student, this is my finals week, and I'm swamped with tickets I need to close, and Drupal makes everything take way too long.
[15:05:09] <pringlescan> I know what I need to do, I just can't figure out where the code is being called, Drupal outputs all this mutilated Jqeury code
[15:05:12] <antnash> So you get a lot of sleep at the mo then!
[15:05:24] <pringlescan> TONS
[15:05:50] <pringlescan> amount of sleep is directly connected to ability to see minor syntax errors
[15:06:03] <zelrik> hi
[15:06:17] <zelrik> how to install javascript plugin on eclipse
[15:06:23] <antnash> and unfortunately there's an inverse connection the other way round too
[15:06:57] <Eviltwin> The Drupal callgraph is insane
[15:07:33] <ravic> can anyone help me by telling how do i post value onclick?. pointer would be more appreciated.
[15:08:09] <Eviltwin> I thin this is a Drpual callgraph for one of their searches: http://drupal.org/files/issues/callgraph-before-257916.jpg
[15:08:57] <Eviltwin> ravic: $("#id").click(function(){$.post("/url/goes/here","data goes here",function(){/* stuff to do when it's done goes here*/})});
[15:09:49] <antnash> Right. One last question. if (data) is [bool, int], how do I get the int?
[15:10:28] <Eviltwin> What?
[15:10:41] <Eviltwin> That depends on how the server parses
[15:10:50] <Eviltwin> If it does param-style parsing
[15:10:57] <Eviltwin> You should make the data be an object instead
[15:11:14] <Eviltwin> Like { "info": [bool, int] }
[15:11:26] <ravic> Eviltwin:  thanks. reading api pages for more info
[15:11:35] <Eviltwin> It will be encoded this way: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[15:12:00] <Eviltwin> And however you can get the POST params
[15:12:06] <antnash> Well the return data for get_speed is [paused, speed]. So I should make it { 'info': [paused, speed]} ?
[15:12:48] <Eviltwin> The *response* can be [pasued, speed] because JavaScript can accept JSON data
[15:13:18] <Eviltwin> The server may be expecting a query string encoding
[15:13:25] <muhoo> pringlescan: xdebug saved my ass in situations like that
[15:13:34] <Eviltwin> It totally depends on how you have the server set up
[15:14:01] <antnash> I might just separate the functions and have def ispaused() and def get_speed()
[15:14:13] <Eviltwin> Whatever you want to do.....
[15:14:27] <muhoo> there's a function in xdebug to show the complete call history for a page.
[15:14:37] <antnash> Gotta say, you guys are really helpful here. A lot more than many other channels
[15:14:45] <muhoo> Eviltwin: what made that chart you linked?
[15:14:50] <muhoo> i'd love to see a similar chart for yii
[15:15:01] <Eviltwin> muhoo: I literally googled "drupal call graph" and hit images
[15:15:03] <Eviltwin> So I have no idea
[15:15:29] <Eviltwin> Here's one of the sites: http://blog.benpjohnson.com/?p=98
[15:15:59] <pringlescan> muhoo: with safari?
[15:16:09] <pringlescan> or do you mean xdebug for php?
[15:16:52] <muhoo> xdebug for php
[15:17:13] <muhoo> kind of off-topic, but i found it a huge help for taking over someone's insanely complicated undocumented codebase
[15:17:41] <Eviltwin> I'd imagine so
[15:18:49] <muhoo> xdebug.trace_options = 1 and xdebug.trace_enable_trigger = 1 i think, then you put a call to xdebug_trace() or something similar in your PHP
[15:19:06] <muhoo> also xdebug.collect_includes = 1, xdebug.collect_params = 3, xdebug.collect_return = 1
[15:19:22] <muhoo> it dumps a whole call history to a file like /tmp/trace.xxxx
[15:21:38] <pringlescan> muhoo: thanks for the tip, I need the .js equivilant, chrome helps, and so does firebug but I'm missing something...
[15:21:54] <muhoo> firebug is great
[15:22:48] <muhoo> pringlescan: um, http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-get-backtraces-in-Javascript ?
[15:23:02] <muhoo> also http://snipplr.com/view/23047/ ?
[15:23:52] <pringlescan> muhoo: thanks
[15:24:10] <muhoo> i'd guess the javascript profiler would do it  too
[15:24:58] <muhoo> console.profile()  at the beginning ofo the page, then console.profileEnd()  at the end?
[15:25:51] <muhoo> haven't tried it but it looks promising

[15:56:03] <Eviltwin> You're trying to post the HTML, not like a form or something?
[15:56:23] <Eviltwin> You're trying to be directed to the other page?
[15:56:41] <ravic> Yes.
[15:58:01] <antnash> Yo Eviltwin. Would if I mouseover something, is that then the input in focus?
[15:58:11] <antnash> without the would.
[15:58:42] <chee> antnash: no it's not focused then. it'd be focused if you clicked on it or tabbed to it
[15:58:50] <antnash> hmm
[15:59:08] <antnash> that's what I thought
[16:00:18] <antnash> My other idea is that this is incorrect...     if (! $(elem) == $.focussed()) {....}
[16:00:55] <antnash> Woot! Only 1 hour to go before Ultimate Fighter finale!
[16:04:29] <Eviltwin> ravic: You're going to need to do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/zTj9U/2/
[16:05:00] <Eviltwin> antnash: What's your goal?
[16:05:39] <ravic> Woow! cool. I appreciate it.
[16:05:46] <ravic> lemme use it
[16:05:51] <antnash> I'm just trying to check if a textbox has focus. If it doesn't, then execute code.
[16:06:43] <antnash> I could use document.activeElement I guess

[16:07:08] <abstrakt> or at least advise which ones to avoid because they do suck :P

[16:15:44] <Eviltwin> abstrakt: What?
[16:15:59] <Eviltwin> ravic: Then you're doing something else wrong
[16:16:06] <abstrakt> vendor/assets/stylesheets exists
[16:16:07] <Eviltwin> I tested that code I sent you and it works
[16:16:12] <abstrakt> why doesn't vendor/assets/javascripts exist
[16:16:24] <abstrakt> oh crap, sorry wrong chan!
[16:16:25] <Eviltwin> I honestly have no idea what you're saying
[16:16:40] <Eviltwin> ANd it'd more likely be vendor/assets/javascript
[16:17:08] <antnash> That's awesome, cheers dude!

[17:10:17] <PaperBoy> Hello everyone.
[17:10:37] <chee> hello PaperBoy
[17:10:49] <PaperBoy> Today is my first day with jquery :)
[17:11:20] <gkatsev> is today your first day with javascript too?
[17:12:31] <PaperBoy> Well no maybe 5th day with js
[17:17:33] <gkatsev> ok :/
[17:17:57] <gkatsev> PaperBoy: just remember that jquery is a tool and it is not all of javascript.
[17:19:04] <sunscreen> how to grow a div automatically with out a plugin?
[17:22:05] <radiantstatic> I'm attempting to get the #mailContain div to slide to the right on the click of #mailCloseButton. Any ideas on where to start? http://jsfiddle.net/radiantstatic/tD7dQ/24/
[17:33:25] <PaperBoy> gkatsev: i do respect that its a js lib but i just can devote the time to learn javascript right now..  and after consulting with many people, they say i can get away with not learning it. Its not the best practice i know, but i just cant devote the time.
[17:34:45] <scar2> There's a slider I'm using and it works fine transitioning every 6 seconds. However, if I minimize that window or have something covering up the slider, and then I was X seconds and come back, the slider is going haywire as if it's "catching up" to the # of times it should have transitioned while away. Any ideas?
[17:36:16] <gkatsev> PaperBoy: you can't get away with not learning js. But at least you recognize that it is just a lib. I would suggest taking an hour or 2 going through http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html. and then learning more of js itself when you do have time.
[17:39:04] <sunscreen> overflow: hidden <-- your farther luke
[17:39:55] <gkatsev> sunscreen: father?
[17:43:23] <PaperBoy> gkatsev: so learning to use jquery would not automatically give me the js knowledge?

[18:07:45] <Robato> Im trying to select the dom element without an event like click...so .live() doesnt work
[18:12:18] <radiantstatic> I'm attempting to have this panel slide in and out. When the #mailCloseButton is clicked, I'm trying to have the entire #mailContain slide right. Any ideas how? http://jsfiddle.net/radiantstatic/tD7dQ/25/
[18:13:47] <radiantstatic> Any idizzles?
[18:21:46] <X-Rob> radiantstatic, I googled 'jquery slide right' and this was the first page: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/596608/jquery-slide-right-to-left
[18:39:43] <WebDragon> anyone using the most recent 2.0.x series of Fancybox ? had any issues marrying it with jquery.cycle ?
[18:51:37] <krogant> how do i detect whether an element is hidden with .hide()?
[18:53:28] <WebDragon> :hidden or :visible might work
[18:53:38] <WebDragon> $(".element:hidden") for example
[18:54:12] <krogant> ahh - thanks, i'll try
[18:54:55] <WebDragon> or if you need a test, krogant you could try if( $(element).is(":visible") == true) { // stuff here }
[18:55:28] <WebDragon> this will also check if the parent is visible, i.e. if it's container has been hidden, :visible will report that the child element is also hidden
[18:55:35] <krogant> works a charm - thanks
[18:55:39] <WebDragon> cheers
[18:55:53] <WebDragon> anyone using the most recent 2.0.x series of Fancybox ? had any issues marrying it with jquery.cycle ?
[18:56:02] <krogant> ah, i did (':hidden', $(this))
[18:56:19] <krogant> i guess $(this).is(':hidden') would read better
[18:56:32] <WebDragon> don't forget the == true, because it returns boolean
[18:56:55] <WebDragon> i.e. if( $(element).is(":visible") ) is not correctly done
[18:57:12] <krogant> well, if it just returns bool, then surely it is?
[18:57:19] <krogant> if (true) is correct?
[18:57:36] <zulax> does .getScript have problems on chromium?
[18:58:49] <zulax> gives me Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[18:58:54] <WebDragon> http://addyosmani.com/jqprovenperformance/  nice
[18:59:43] <WebDragon> krogant: maybe I'm just low on coffee
[18:59:47] * WebDragon checks his IV
[19:01:07] <krogant> heh

[19:19:42] <krogant> is it possible to prevent text in an element from eing highlighted when double clicked?

[19:29:09] <CrazyZurfer> hello
[19:29:30] <CrazyZurfer> hey ppl!
[19:29:38] <CrazyZurfer> anyone knows about jquery mobile?
[19:29:52] <CrazyZurfer> no one answers on that channel
[19:30:19] <blbrown_win3> is anyone a IE/js ajax guru, I think I need to monkey patch jquery to fix an issye
[19:30:20] <blbrown_win3> issue
[19:32:47] <Vaerros> krogant: look into the ::selection psuedo-element
[19:41:52] <Eviltwin> krogant: I think if you preventDefault the click
[19:42:00] <Eviltwin> It stops it from being selected
[19:42:56] <krogant> ok, thanks
[19:46:42] <CrazyZurfer> hellooooo!
[19:46:52] <CrazyZurfer> anyone knows a little bit about jquerymobile?
[19:49:05] <ragas> i see addClass in the docs, but how do i add an ID ?
[19:49:21] <Eviltwin> There's a reason there's not an addID
[19:49:25] <Eviltwin> An element can only have one
[19:49:27] <Eviltwin> And it's an attribute
[19:49:29] <Eviltwin> So you use .attr instead
[19:49:42] <danzik17> Eviltwin: property, not attribute :)
[19:50:14] <ragas> im trying to create a new element.
[19:50:21] <ragas> and want to give it an id
[19:50:36] <ragas> so ok, i'll do it w attr
[19:50:53] <ragas> uh, property
[19:51:20] <danzik17> ragas: see ?prop
[19:51:21] <bot-t> ragas, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[19:52:57] <krogant> Eviltwin: so i have ('#foo td').click(function(event){event.preventDefault();....}); but the text inside the td is still being highlighted?
[19:53:31] <krogant> when i check the demo page on docs.jquery.org, a double click doesn't highlight the text in ff
[19:55:09] <chee> krogant: i liked Vaerros's idea of using css's ::selection
[19:55:35] <krogant> how?
[19:55:36] <chee> #foo td::selection, #foo td::-moz-selection { background-color: transparent; }
[19:55:47] <krogant> oh
[19:55:49] <chee> that would be in a stylesheet of course
[19:56:02] <krogant> does :selection work?
[19:56:02] <chee> i mean, it would still highlight it.. but it would look like it didn't!
[19:56:07] <Vaerros> assuming it makes sense to prevent highlight in the first place
[19:57:28] <Eviltwin> krogant: Try binding to mousedown and mousemove instead
[19:57:37] <Eviltwin> krogant: http://jsfiddle.net/3wzts/
[20:01:28] <krogant> Eviltwin: thanks
[20:02:37] <krogant> Eviltwin: why is mousemove necessary?
[20:07:05] <fotoflo> hmm, I'm using jquery-ui and i have a <div class = "draggable"><img><div>text</div></div>  structureâ€¦. when i drag the structure, only the image gets moved, not the text. any suggestions on how to make this work?
[20:09:23] <fotoflo> wow. i was messing with this for a few hours before i askedâ€¦ just figured it out, never mind
[20:09:24] <krogant> is your jq saying... make everything inside the draggable div draggable?
[20:10:48] <fotoflo> krogant: i had a line of css that was screwing multiple things up
[20:31:36] <ragas> $("p").add("span").css("background", "yellow").[insertion method];
[20:34:39] <necromancer> can you pass multiple input files into google closure compiler?
[20:34:55] <Eviltwin> We're not really the ones to ask about that
[20:35:09] <krogant> are there any decent code obsfucators that can handle jquery?
[20:35:11] <Eviltwin> krogant: I don't know. I just did it
[20:35:17] <Eviltwin> Referring to the mousemove
[20:35:31] <Eviltwin> You can try without
[20:35:40] <krogant> Eviltwin: it seems to work on ff at least without it? i thought mousemove would be a little processor intensive?
[20:38:35] <Eviltwin> krogant: I just saw some post about it somewhere where the guy did that
[20:38:41] <Eviltwin> Don't know if it's important or not
[20:39:27] <krogant> heh - well thanks, it seems to work - for now!
[20:40:37] <chee> it seems to work in chrom without mousemove too
[20:56:12] <rookie84> hi everyone, how can i set ids for the Jui sortable?
[20:56:18] <Eviltwin> ?
[20:56:20] <rookie84> for example <li id="something"
[20:56:49] <Eviltwin> I don't understand the question
[20:56:53] <Eviltwin> Your LI appears to have an ID
[20:57:20] <rookie84> ok let me explain the question a bit :)
[20:57:26] <rookie84> i know it doesn't makes much sense.
[20:57:33] <rookie84> i have a draggable and a sortable
[20:57:47] <rookie84> what i want to do is drag from the draggable area into the sortable and do a state save function
[20:58:33] <rookie84> for that jquery says: $('#sortable').sortable('toArray')
[20:58:39] <abstrakt> so how can I turn an <input type="text"> into a slider?
[20:58:39] <rookie84> which saves the IDs of the <li>'s
[20:59:03] <abstrakt> it seems that slider only works on divs and the like
[20:59:09] <abstrakt> if I do it on <input type="text" /> then it just stays a text area
[20:59:15] <Eviltwin> rookie84: Do you have actual code I could play with?
[20:59:28] <rookie84> Eviltwin: sure, let me paste it
[20:59:28] <Eviltwin> I don't really work with jQuery UI often enough to know the details of how it works
[20:59:34] <Eviltwin> If possible, make a jsFiddle
[20:59:34] <rookie84> abstrakt: use a <div> for the form
[20:59:39] <rookie84> ok
[21:00:07] <abstrakt> rookie84, umm, I don't follow, sorry what now?
[21:00:22] <abstrakt> rookie84, I want the value from the slider to be submitted with my form
[21:00:46] <rookie84> <div id="mytext"><input type="text" name="t"></div>
[21:01:08] <rookie84> $('#mytext') <-- slide it.
[21:01:13] <Eviltwin> abstrakt: Have you looked at this? http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/
[21:02:25] <rookie84> oh a slider, i thought he meant a slide thing (slide up or down )
[21:04:04] <abstrakt> Eviltwin, yes that is what I am using
[21:04:50] <rookie84> http://jsfiddle.net/rookie84/S9MyC/
[21:04:58] <rookie84> Eviltwin: using jsfiddle for the first time, sorry
[21:05:36] <abstrakt> rookie84, hmm, and then the slider will change the value of <input type="text" name="t"> ?
[21:05:46] <abstrakt> rookie84, where did you find the docs on that?
[21:06:04] <rookie84> abstrakt: i'm sorry i gave you the wrong answer, i thougth you meant a slide up or down function.
[21:06:14] <rookie84> i have no experience with a slider.
[21:06:15] <Eviltwin> abstrakt: http://jsfiddle.net/qXhEz/
[21:06:18] <Eviltwin> How's that?
[21:06:54] <Eviltwin> rookie84: see ?jdb
[21:06:55] <bot-t1> rookie84, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[21:07:29] <Eviltwin> Also none of these relative paths are going to work
[21:07:37] <Eviltwin> So these things aren't actually draggable or sortable
[21:07:40] <abstrakt> Eviltwin, hmm, yeah ok I guess that's fine, I'll just have to do it on a hidden input field
[21:07:48] <Eviltwin> abstrakt: Exactly the same way
[21:07:50] <Eviltwin> In fact
[21:08:13] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/qXhEz/1/
[21:08:17] <Eviltwin> That's what I had originally
[21:08:35] <Eviltwin> So that if that code didn't run, it would still let them put in text
[21:08:37] <Eviltwin> Kind of a fallback
[21:08:38] <rookie84> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/rookie84/S9MyC/1/
[21:08:44] <rookie84> an updated version now you can see.
[21:09:14] <Eviltwin> Better but this is still a lot of code for me to read through
[21:09:19] <Eviltwin> And I'm not getting paid to do it
[21:10:11] <Eviltwin> Also, do you know what .parent('li') does?
[21:10:46] <Eviltwin> Like say I have <ul><li><div><a id="foo"></a></div></li></ul>
[21:10:52] <Eviltwin> And I do $("#foo").parent("li")
[21:10:54] <Eviltwin> What do I get?
[21:11:04] <rookie84> the <li> <--
[21:11:04] <rookie84> ?
[21:11:14] <rookie84> immediate parent?
[21:11:23] <Eviltwin> It'll actually be an empty collection
[21:11:34] <rookie84> how so? because it works for me?
[21:11:53] <necromancer> hey has anyone here tried to compile jQuery with closure?
[21:12:02] <Eviltwin> necromancer: It's not supported
[21:12:04] <necromancer> i get all these warnings and it doesn't generate the output file
[21:12:06] <necromancer> aww dammit
[21:12:07] <necromancer> really?
[21:12:12] <necromancer> shit
[21:12:13] <Eviltwin> I know we explained this to someone recently and I thought it was you
[21:12:17] <Eviltwin> But maybe I'm wrong
[21:12:20] <necromancer> nope
[21:12:28] <necromancer> well maybe
[21:12:33] <necromancer> i dunno i was probably high
[21:12:44] <rookie84> Eviltwin: what you just said, it really works for me
[21:12:53] <rookie84> the parent('li') thing?
[21:12:57] <necromancer> Eviltwin: do you know of any command-line compilers for JS that work with jQuery?
[21:13:07] <Eviltwin> rookie84: http://jsfiddle.net/YcrWM/
[21:13:10] <rookie84> what i need is order id's assigned to a sortable
[21:14:56] <Eviltwin> Why do you need order IDs assigned?
[21:15:05] <Eviltwin> This doesn't really make any sense to me
[21:15:30] <rookie84> because i want to save the state
[21:15:41] <rookie84> $('#sortable').sortable('toArray') needs that
[21:16:00] <rookie84> http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#method-toArray
[21:16:17] <Eviltwin> Also, it's $(document).ready not $('document').ready
[21:16:48] <necromancer> Eviltwin: apparently only SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS are supported.. http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7318
[21:16:54] <rookie84> parent('li') <-- whats a substituion for this?
[21:17:09] <necromancer> oh wait never mind
[21:17:10] <necromancer> lol
[21:17:14] <svcghost> hey guys. there is a function to get the content type of a page (document.contentType) only for Firefox. Is there an equivalent for Chrome, Safari, IE, perhaps with jQUery?
[21:19:48] <Eviltwin> ?closest @ rookie84
[21:19:48] <bot-t1> rookie84, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[21:20:33] <Eviltwin> necromancer: All I know is jQuery specifically does not advertise support for clojure
[21:20:37] <rookie84> ok great, thankyou for sorting these bad errors.
[21:20:45] <Eviltwin> And as far as I know, they do not plan to
[21:21:12] <Eviltwin> rookie84: From my undersatnding, toArray should return a list of the IDs in the sortable
[21:21:21] <Eviltwin> So the IDs should be set initially already
[21:21:37] <rookie84> ok but the thing is that i move things into the sortable from the draggable
[21:21:44] <necromancer> Eviltwin: Clojure is a language. Closure is the library and compiler. :)
[21:21:58] <necromancer> i'd rather use uglify anyway and turns out it does have a command line tool. silly me.
[21:22:03] <Eviltwin> Sorry, I typo'd
[21:22:14] <MiguelV> Can beginner questions be asked in this room or better be asked somewhere else?
[21:22:25] <Eviltwin> MiguelV: Depends on the question
[21:22:30] <Eviltwin> MiguelV: But in general, ?ask
[21:22:33] <Eviltwin> ?ask
[21:22:34] <bot-t1> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[21:23:37] <MiguelV> I've exhausted google on this topic I have an iframe loading content with an id "loaded" and i am having issues with closing the dialog ui box once content in the iframe is loaded
[21:23:43] <MiguelV> this is what I am using currently
[21:23:56] <MiguelV> $(document).ready(function(){
[21:23:56] <MiguelV> $("#example").dialog({modal: true});
[21:23:57] <MiguelV> });
[21:23:57] <MiguelV> $('#loaded').load(function() {
[21:23:57] <MiguelV> $("#example").dialog("close");

[21:24:13] <Eviltwin> Don't just paste to the channel
[21:24:23] <MiguelV> just saw the bot message
[21:24:27] <MiguelV> appologies
[21:24:32] <MiguelV> new to IRC
[21:25:03] <Eviltwin> There are restrictions regarding iframe communication
[21:25:05] <Eviltwin> For security reasons
[21:25:08] <Eviltwin> Such as
[21:25:08] <Eviltwin> ?sop
[21:25:09] <bot-t1> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[21:25:10] <ikla> whats the best way to see if an input type exists?
[21:25:22] <svcghost> How do you check if the HTML in an iFrame has a body tag? (yes it is on my domain)
[21:25:29] <Eviltwin> ikla: $("input[type=hidden]").length
[21:25:29] <svcghost> This isn't working if($('#iframe').contents().find('body').length > 0)
[21:25:54] <surfdue> How can i delay each each() iterance
[21:26:03] <MiguelV> what if I use an obect, embed? its a large pdf i am trying to load
[21:26:24] <Eviltwin> And why are you trying to load it in a frame again?
[21:26:36] <ikla> tx
[21:26:52] <surfdue> this is driving me nuts lol
[21:27:09] <MiguelV> im trying to popup the dialog saying please wait while we load the large item (pdf) and then once loaded the modal box disappears
[21:27:30] <MiguelV> pops up and disappears really quick in IE
[21:27:38] <Eviltwin> surfdue: http://jsfiddle.net/b8unG/
[21:27:40] <MiguelV> FF no issues
[21:27:48] <Eviltwin> surfdue: You can't directly
[21:28:04] <surfdue> o damn http://mikethecoder.com/post/861305291/add-pauses-between-jquery-each-loop-iterations
[21:28:09] <surfdue> Eviltwin: i found that right when you said it
[21:28:15] <Eviltwin> MiguelV: Is #loaded the iframe itself?
[21:29:37] <MiguelV> so page1.php has a drop down that will open a new page that is a HTML file with the iframe scr=whatever.pdf
[21:30:00] <MiguelV> the iframe uses php to dynamically build the link to the pdf
[21:30:14] <MiguelV> echo pdffilename.pdf
[21:30:46] <MiguelV> worked great with .ready on both but only for FF
[21:31:49] <Eviltwin> svcghost: http://jsfiddle.net/b8unG/
[21:32:38] <rookie84> Eviltwin: $('#sortable').sortable('toArray') doesn't work at all
[21:32:56] <rookie84> <ul id="sortable"><li>one</li><li>two</li></ul>
[21:33:23] <MiguelV> what about when stuff in iframe is completely loaded and get rid of ui box
[21:33:56] <Eviltwin> Why don't you just do $('#sortable').children('li').map(function(){return $(this).text()})
[21:33:59] <Eviltwin> Or something
[21:34:01] <MiguelV> instead of alert .close()?
[21:34:24] <niftylettuce> does anyone see anything wrong with this simple $.ajax request? https://gist.github.com/a86427cf01dcb7c989ad
[21:34:34] <rookie84> Eviltwin: what i want is get the order :(
[21:34:41] <rookie84> of the items (li's) moved to the sortable area
[21:37:59] <svcghost> Eviltwin: why does that only work in Chrome and Safari? but not Firefox
[21:38:13] <Eviltwin> rookie84: What information are you trying to get about the LIs?
[21:38:15] <svcghost> When I do that in Firefox, it says there is a body when the content is an image
[21:38:28] <svcghost> so if the contenttype is image, it shouldn't have a body tag cuz its not even html
[21:38:30] <rookie84> Eviltwin: i just want to know the order they're placed in
[21:38:40] <rookie84> and the content inside them as well
[21:38:43] <Eviltwin> Okay but how do you know *what* it is?
[21:38:48] <rookie84> so that i can save them to the DB
[21:39:09] <rookie84> Eviltwin: i move them from teh draggable area to the sortable area then i want to do those things.
[21:49:22] <Eviltwin> rookie84: http://jsfiddle.net/teqUL/
[21:49:32] <Whirl3d> hey all. I have a regexp that returns an array of strings that I need to map to an object. i.e. contact["firstname"]=results[3]; contact["lastname"]=results[4]; etc.
[21:49:47] <rookie84> thanks Eviltwin, checking.
[21:49:50] <Whirl3d> could someone give me some pointers?
[21:50:19] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: That's the input like and what's the desired output like?
[21:50:26] <Eviltwin> Can you give an example or two
[21:50:48] <Whirl3d> sure. gimme a minute and I'll make a fiddle. Thanks for your help.
[21:51:31] <rookie84> Eviltwin, thanks much for the great example
[21:51:45] <rookie84> why would $('#sortable').sortable('toArray') not work?
[21:52:41] <Eviltwin> Because it's trying to accomplish a different goal for whatever reason
[21:53:45] <rookie84> hmm
[21:56:08] <Eviltwin> rookie84: I think toArray is designed around there only being on of the element you're dragging
[21:57:41] <rookie84> toArray is for the sortable area
[21:57:58] <rookie84> i tried even static elements with sortable and it still won't work
[22:04:19] <MiguelV> Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong on this? I tried the other option. http://jsfiddle.net/b8unG/2/
[22:12:48] <Eviltwin> MiguelV: You kind of just have a line thrown in there
[22:13:11] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/b8unG/3/
[22:14:09] <MiguelV> haha i see
[22:14:24] <MiguelV> I want the dialog to popup no matter waht
[22:14:25] <MiguelV> what
[22:14:41] <MiguelV> then close one everything inside iframe is loaded or at least starts to load
[22:14:47] <Eviltwin> I think that's called autoOpen
[22:15:11] <Eviltwin> Have you even read this page? http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[22:16:42] <MiguelV> my issue is knowing what event to use
[22:18:00] <Eviltwin> MiguelV: Everything is described in detail on that page
[22:18:03] <Eviltwin> Please read
[22:18:11] <MiguelV> does this make more sense? http://jsfiddle.net/b8unG/4/
[22:18:23] <cloaked1> so, why would this happen... I'm using $.keydown (and have also tried $.bind('keydown',...) to allow the user to tab from a field, which triggers an $.appen(). Im triggering from a class and each new append is placed in the same class. the first time I do it, it works as planned. However, from the new fields that are created, the event doesn't fire. I'm assuming I'm missing something in the append.
[22:19:51] <Eviltwin> MiguelV: Why not this? http://jsfiddle.net/b8unG/5/
[22:20:46] <MiguelV> ahh i see what you did much cleaner
[22:20:59] <Eviltwin> It always is
[22:24:10] <cloaked1> http://pastebin.com/UjuSVKU3
[22:24:30] <cloaked1> hmmm
[22:24:35] <cloaked1> $.live()
[22:24:40] <cloaked1> let's check that out.
[22:25:31] <cloaked1> yup, that fixed it
[22:25:38] <cloaked1> nm all.
[22:26:20] <Eviltwin> Don't use .live
[22:26:28] <Eviltwin> Ever
[22:28:10] <_cb> within a web page I am doing $("#div").load(url). The page loads but the images do not. Images are in the same folder as the page. If I put the url on a browser page and images load. Any solutions other than putting complete path on the src?
[22:30:45] <Eviltwin> _cb: You have to go to each one and fix it
[22:30:51] <Eviltwin> Or have it be absolute in the SRC
[22:32:16] <_cb> I would like to be able to test the page on my local pc and once it is ok upload the folder any way to do that other than changing the src before uploading?
[22:32:41] <Eviltwin> I honestly didn't understand that question
[22:33:29] <_cb> If I make the src absolute then I have to remove the http://.... to test on my pc and add it again when I upload the page to the web server
[22:37:54] <MiguelV> Evil the last script you shortened worked perfectly in FF but fires the dialog.('close') too quick in IE and Chrome. Any one every experience this?]
[22:38:41] <MiguelV> dialog shows up and poof gone before anything can be read
[22:40:47] <_cb> I think that the problem is that on the .load(url) the browser does not assume root to be (url) and thus does not know where to find the images.
[22:41:43] <MiguelV> ahhh
[22:52:09] <Majicpanda> hey guys, i have an onchange event that fires when i select an option... if i perform $("#class").val(data.class).attr("selected", "selected"); how can i also fire the onchange event so it changes the options of my second select?
[22:53:00] <Eviltwin> Majicpanda: Add a .change() to the end
[22:53:01] <Eviltwin> ?
[22:53:54] <Majicpanda> that was retarded.. lol, was trying to fire it separate but forgot you can stack like 50 functions on 1
[22:53:59] <Majicpanda> yea.. that did it x_X
[22:54:18] <Majicpanda> blame jager
[22:55:39] <Majicpanda> nice, yea, i had a chain of selected and change events going off like crazy.. just took the right combo
[22:58:35] <bufferxyz> hi guys, I wonder if I should use a GET or a POST request if I am trying to update *only* the session data(backed by cache not db)?
[22:58:57] <bufferxyz>  it is clear to me that POST request should be used for modifications that occurs to the database, but I am unclear as whether this is the case too on cache backed *session* data
[22:59:26] <xaxxon> post = new stuff, put = change stuff, delete = delete stuff, get = get stuff
[22:59:29] <xaxxon> imhop
[22:59:31] <xaxxon> imho
[22:59:41] <xaxxon> or crud if you will
[23:00:11] <bufferxyz> xaxxon: thanks for the reply, I understand this, though I am not sure if this applies to session data as well?
[23:00:36] <bufferxyz> xaxxon:  so to modify session data, do you *really* need a POST request?
[23:17:18] <IdleWarship> Hey, folks!  If I've got an object = { "this" : "that" } how do I refer to "this" and "that"?
[23:22:03] <macmartine> IdleWarship: obj["this"] will get you 'that'. not sure how to get the key
[23:25:02] <balr0g> hello, is mouseout() or mouseleave() the right version for "un-hover"?
[23:26:28] <IdleWarship> Definitely not obj[0] ?
[23:28:06] <imakewebthings> IdleWarship, it's not x-browser, but you can get an array of the keys using Object.keys(obj)
[23:28:22] <imakewebthings> ?mdn object.keys
[23:28:24] <bot-t1> imakewebthings, Event Object - jQuerys event system normalizes the event object according to W3C standards . The event object is guaranteed to be passed to the event handler. Most properties from the original event are copied ov... http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[23:28:36] <imakewebthings> wrong bot-t1 :(
[23:28:53] <imakewebthings> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys
[23:29:14] <imakewebthings> anyway, Underscore.js has a x-browser method, _.keys
[23:34:28] <IdleWarship> imakewebthings: So, I'm feeling that I'm doing this wrong: I'm checking several key-values, and if the values match, I'm decrementing the keys... How can I use object.keys to keep from losing track of the keys?
[23:35:21] <imakewebthings> IdleWarship maybe you should post a snippet so we can get a better picture at what you're trying to do
[23:36:20] <imakewebthings> IdleWarship: Because your text description makes it sound like you have the objects backwards.  Your keys should be your values and your values your keys
[23:37:19] <Whirl3d> For the sake of discussion: How do you determine whether to build elements dynamically or whether to preconfigure them in markup?
[23:38:29] <Whirl3d> I keep waffling back and forth...one minute, I do it all in markup and then I think, "that was tedious, I could've done that in jquery and saved having to write 50 lines of markup"
[23:39:05] <IdleWarship> If speaker = { "24" : "0", "12" : "1", "6" : "1", "3" : "0" }, I'd change 12 to 10 and 6 to 4.
[23:39:47] <IdleWarship> On the next iteration, I'd check the values again, and maybe decrement differently.
[23:41:28] <Whirl3d> Can you have an object written like that?
[23:41:58] <IdleWarship> Alternatively, I'd speaker = [0, 1, 1, 0] and store the decimal elsewhere, somehow.
[23:42:36] <Whirl3d> IdleWarship, what do these values represent?
[23:43:10] <Whirl3d> and are the values always going to be 1 or 0?
[23:43:52] <IdleWarship> Whirl3d: Yes.  They represent whether or not someone is speaking; whether the volume from their mic is past the mark necessary to activate VOX.
[23:44:12] <IdleWarship> s/necessary/sufficient
[23:44:22] <Whirl3d> ok. so what does the key represent?
[23:44:25] <Whirl3d> a user?
[23:44:29] <Whirl3d> or a loudness?
[23:44:38] <Whirl3d> or an instrument:
[23:45:07] <IdleWarship> Uh, the key is a health bar that depletes when two or more people talk simultaneously.
[23:47:05] <Whirl3d> I'm just not understanding what you are trying to accomplish with this object.
[23:47:11] <WebDragon> LMFAO
[23:47:23] <WebDragon> "fuck that, that one has a mana bar"
[23:48:01] <Whirl3d> When I look at an object, I think like this: My object has properties (keys) and values. Your object appears to have values and values, but no keys. What does 24 represent in your object?
[23:48:16] <Whirl3d> or 12, or 6, or 3?
[23:49:30] <WebDragon> http://xrl.us/bmj6qf Boss Spider
[23:49:32] <imakewebthings> so you have speakers.  And each speaker is talking or not (a boolean), and has health (an integer) ?
[23:49:41] <WebDragon> (the one with the mana bar)
[23:50:07] <imakewebthings> so why not an Array or speaker objects, each speaker object is { health: 24, talking: 0 }
[23:50:21] <imakewebthings> array OF* speaker objects
[23:51:25] <IdleWarship> imakewebthings: I think you're right, I should make a seperate object for each speaker.
[23:51:28] <imakewebthings> or speakers could be an object if it has keys that correspond to some id or name of the speaker
[23:51:28] <Whirl3d> or do you mean speaker as in the device speaker?
[23:51:42] <IdleWarship> Whirl3d: No, as in a speaker on stages, sorry.
[23:51:49] <Whirl3d> np
[23:52:11] <IdleWarship> Whirl3d: 24 or 16 represents the speaker's "health."
[23:52:12] <imakewebthings> matching physical objects to actual objects is usually a good place to start
[23:52:28] <imakewebthings> er physical objects to JS.... actual was a bad choice of words
[23:52:33] <Whirl3d> Definitely make an object for each speaker like imakewebthings indicated.
[23:54:06] <Whirl3d> then you could access each speaker's health easily: var john={health:24, speaking:true}; console.log(john.health)  will show you 24
[23:56:42] <IdleWarship> Whirl3d: Ok, that seems fairly straightforward; how can I check if john.speaking = mary.speaking?
[23:57:04] <Rembane> IdleWarship: Add another =
[23:57:18] <Whirl3d> if (john.speaking) {console.log("John is speaking");}
[23:57:49] <Whirl3d> if (john.speaking && mary.speaking) {john.health-=6; mary.health-=6;}
[23:58:03] <Whirl3d> would drop each speaker's health if they were both speaking
[23:59:49] <IdleWarship> Whirl3d: You are making javascript extremely clear to me.
