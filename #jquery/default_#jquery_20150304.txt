[00:30:02] <jomofcw> Hello !
[00:30:26] <jomofcw> Do you know any more up-to-date Iddle timer plugin please ? Here I've got this one : http://www.paulirish.com/2009/jquery-idletimer-plugin/
[00:42:46] <Omar-> good morning
[01:12:54] <jomofcw> Here is the answer to my previous question : http://thorst.github.io/jquery-idletimer/prod/demos/
[01:13:05] <Omar-> if the code here http://jsfiddle.net/jvfkwszm/ is converted into pure JS, would it be faster?
[01:16:09] <interop_madness> Omar-, probably not really, but the main performance problem this code has is that there is no delay for the keyup handler
[01:17:26] <interop_madness> Omar-, if a user is typing a few letters quickly, it is of no interest for them to display the intermediate results. so you can introduce a delay (e.g. 100ms) after which the list is refreshed, *if* within that delay, no further keypress occurred (else, reset timer for the delay)
[01:17:27] <Cork> its in key up not keydown so that shouldn't be a problem
[01:18:01] <Omar-> interop_madness true, I thought of it. also I thought of start filtering after entering 3 chars
[01:18:13] <Cork> Omar-: i would recommend moving $("#demo tbody").find("tr") outside the event handler
[01:18:23] <Cork> cause that is your most expensive line
[01:18:49] <Cork> $(this).text().toLowerCase().indexOf(data) isn't cheap, but... shouldn't be too bad
[01:19:13] <Omar-> interop_madness +1 precious notes :)
[01:19:25] <Cork> Omar-: na option could be to store the content of the field in lowercase as a data- attribute
[01:19:39] <Omar-> Cork moving it outside is also a good idea, but in that case it'll be a global variable
[01:19:43] <Omar-> which I want to avoid
[01:19:51] <Cork> no it doesn't have to be
[01:20:43] <Omar-> how can I make $("#demo tbody").find("tr") not global?
[01:21:18] <Cork> Omar-: http://jsfiddle.net/jvfkwszm/1/
[01:22:40] <Code2Consumer> Hi! When i use ajax to read XML, Who execute the code ? Is it the client or the server ? :O
[01:22:44] <Cork> Omar-: that change should reduce the dom touching to just add/remove class
[01:22:57] <Cork> can't be much faster then that
[01:23:50] <Omar-> nice one Cork
[01:23:57] <Code2Consumer> Hey Cork ! :) I remember you :) You helped me 1 month ago ! ^^ Thanks again
[01:24:04] <Cork> Omar-: also note the difference between toLowerCase and toLocaleLowerCase
[01:24:13] <Cork> Code2Consumer: heh, np
[01:24:21] <Omar-> toLocaleLowerCase this is new
[01:24:29] <Cork> i suspect you want the later
[01:24:38] <Cork> if you ever expect to support utf8 text
[01:24:42] <Omar-> i'll look it up
[01:24:50] <Cork> ?mdn toLocaleLowerCase
[01:24:51] <b-ot> Cork: String.prototype.toLocaleLowerCase() - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLocaleLowerCase
[01:25:18] <Code2Consumer> Does someone know an ajax chanel or can help me with ajax ?
[01:25:57] <Cork> that would be a channel with a very narrow topic :)
[01:26:02] <Cork> ?ask @ Code2Consumer
[01:26:02] <b-ot> Code2Consumer: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:26:19] <Code2Consumer> When i use ajax to read XML, Who execute the code ? Is it the client or the server ? :O
[01:26:28] <Cork> Code2Consumer: execute what code?
[01:26:41] <Cork> to that generic question the answer is "both"
[01:28:19] <Code2Consumer> both ? thats a probleme xD
[01:28:44] <Code2Consumer> for a project i need to get an xml everytime i reload the page
[01:28:47] <Omar-> Cork If I wrap code in <head> it doesn't work. I'm not too familiar with IIFE functions http://jsfiddle.net/jvfkwszm/2/
[01:29:11] <Code2Consumer> so i wanned to know if that wouldnt be too hard for the serveur
[01:29:23] <Code2Consumer> we have 600 connection a day
[01:29:30] <Cork> Omar-: if you have the code in head you need the ready wrapper (and won't need the extra scope)
[01:29:50] <Cork> Code2Consumer: http is text, nothing else
[01:30:00] <Omar-> Cork the code is for jQM, we use "pagecreate" instead of "ready"
[01:30:04] <Omar-> I'll test it
[01:30:12] <Cork> Code2Consumer: so the server has to convert the data it has to xml text and push it over the network
[01:30:31] <Cork> Code2Consumer: client side then has to pars this xml into a dom object it can traverse
[01:30:47] <Cork> Code2Consumer: if you want to make this efficient i would strongly recommend using json instead
[01:30:52] <Omar-> yup, it needed pagecreate/ready
[01:30:53] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/jvfkwszm/3/
[01:30:56] <Cork> as xml is very inefficient memory mapping
[01:31:29] <Omar-> if i remove the scope, "jo" won't become global var, right?
[01:31:29] <Cork> Omar-: you don't need the extra scope wrapper there
[01:31:33] <Cork> it won't be global anyway
[01:31:42] <Cork> :)
[01:31:43] <Cork> ya
[01:31:59] <Omar-> wonderful, thanks :)
[01:32:43] <Code2Consumer> actually the best way for me would be to keep the text i need but i dont kow how to do it ! :O session in php is a bad idea i gess
[01:33:11] <Cork> Code2Consumer: generating json with json_encode should be fast in most systems
[01:33:41] <Cork> you could look into using memcache if you want a storage solution for the generated response
[01:33:59] <Cork> or you could just save it to a .json file and serv that
[01:34:00] <Code2Consumer> memcache ?
[01:34:05] <Cork> ?g memcache
[01:34:06] <b-ot> Cork: memcached - a distributed memory object caching system → http://memcached.org/
[01:34:19] <Code2Consumer> ok i note this thank you again Cork
[01:34:24] <Omar-> how to connect to imgur API through Ajax. I dont have a server, it's only for testing purposes https://api.imgur.com/
[01:34:33] <Cork> but 600 queries a day is nothing
[01:34:57] <Cork> pure php + sql should be able to handle that a minute
[01:35:12] <Cork> unless the data you push is huge
[01:35:14] <Code2Consumer> its 600 * (numberofpagechanging)
[01:35:29] <Code2Consumer> (number of page reloaded )
[01:35:55] <Cork> Code2Consumer: calculate an aprox requests a minute + data size
[01:36:16] <Code2Consumer> i will ! thank you again Cork ! :)
[01:37:09] <Cork> Omar-: i don't think that api is meant to be front facing
[01:44:07] <Omar-> Cork you mean it cant be connected to with $.ajax()?
[01:44:57] <Cork> Omar-: 1. they requires an identify token and the site id to be submitted for each request, you would have to provide this public
[01:45:25] <Cork> 2. it doesn't look like it provides a jsonp call so older ie won't ever be supported
[01:45:41] <Cork> 3. (haven't checked this) but i don't think they provide cors headers
[01:45:56] <Cork> so ya, i think you need a server end to proxy all the connections
[01:46:21] <Cork> can't say for sure about 3 without actually seeing what headers they send
[01:46:41] <Cork> but my bet would be it is for server to server, not server to js in browser
[01:47:18] <Omar-> hmmm
[01:47:39] <Omar-> I wanted to to connect a retrieve media by id
[01:48:06] <Omar-> http://jsbin.com/retaji/
[01:48:29] <Omar-> i'll investigate further
[01:52:08] <neanderslob> hi all, I'm attempting to select an element based on the end of its id using the following: http://stackoverflow.com/a/609399/2540204
[01:52:48] <neanderslob> using the terms in the above link, how might I replace the 'txtTitle' with a variable value?
[01:54:54] <Cork> neanderslob: you really really shouldn't do that
[01:55:14] <Cork> add a class to the elements and select on that instead it is what classes are meant for
[01:56:04] <Cork> neanderslob: you can't do selection based on partial ids, you have to make selection based on text in the attribute "id" and that effectively work around every optimization the browser does for ids
[01:56:08] <Cork> so it is a really bad idea
[01:57:39] <neanderslob> Cork: I was afraid that I might have to go through and add classes
[01:58:22] <Cork> neanderslob: personally i quite rarely use id, classes is much more powerful and the speed is close to the same
[01:58:48] <neanderslob> Cork: good to know
[01:58:51] <Cork> (i mainly use it for form elements and elements that should ever only exist once (no number after the id)
[01:59:08] <Cork> as you can combine multiple classes in a selector and have it on multiple elements
[01:59:36] <neanderslob> Cork:sounds good; guess I might as well bite the bullet and get on with it
[01:59:46] <neanderslob> Cork: many thanks
[01:59:49] <Cork> np
[02:00:02] <Cork> neanderslob: one comment that might save you time
[02:00:18] <Cork> make sure each class isn't a compound of different groups
[02:00:28] <Cork> it is often better to split them into separate classes
[02:00:40] <Cork> then you don't have to edit the html every time you want to target a different group
[02:01:00] <neanderslob> Cork: good tip
[02:01:17] <Cork> so instead of <elm class="email_user"> do <elm class="email user">
[02:01:48] <Cork> neanderslob: it's quite a common mistake so i wanted to make you aware of it before you had to redo it all AGAIN ;)
[02:02:08] <neanderslob> Cork: that makes a lot of sense
[02:02:15] <neanderslob> Cork: thanks
[02:15:09] <BrazenBraden> is there a way to see all the events that get called? maybe a setting/tab in the chrome dev tools or a browser plugin?
[02:17:50] <Cork> BrazenBraden: http://www.briangrinstead.com/blog/chrome-developer-tools-monitorevents
[02:19:00] <BrazenBraden> Cork, thanks man :)
[02:19:25] <Cork> firefox exposes it as a small (ev) button next to the elements in the source view
[02:19:33] <Cork> if you need to check there
[02:19:48] <BrazenBraden> cool
[02:24:40] <BrazenBraden> Ok so it doesnt seem to be an event issue.. when I click a button that ajax loads a bit of view, my page jumps to random bits of the page
[02:24:58] <BrazenBraden> wait
[02:25:08] <BrazenBraden> it always seems to be the exact same scroll distance
[02:26:37] <BrazenBraden> yea.. to scrollY = 2437
[02:27:04] <rzeka> How can I detect that something is injected into dom?
[02:27:56] <BrazenBraden> hmm, looks to be dependant on my window size.. resized browser on a smaller monitor and now its scrollY=2234
[02:28:12] <Cork> rzeka: you can't cross browser
[02:28:24] <Cork> really new browsers has MutationObservers
[02:28:29] <Cork> but that isn't cross browser yet
[02:28:46] <Cork> rzeka: the best option is to have the code that adds the element notify you
[02:31:55] <rzeka> k, thx
[03:04:56] <Tennis> o/ Morning. Does anyone know why tags turn red in jsfiddle?
[03:11:23] <Cork> Tennis: jsfiddle enforces xhtml syntax
[03:11:36] <Cork> but it is also an indicated of "uncloded tags"
[03:11:45] <Cork> *indication
[03:16:28] <Tennis> ok cheers
[03:17:13] <Omar-> which is correct var foo = bar || "undefined"; OR var foo = bar || undefined;
[03:45:58] <Cork> Omar-: the later
[03:46:26] <Cork> Omar-: though unless bar is a boolean, that is basically the same as just var foo = bar;
[03:53:01] <Omar-> Cork assuming bar is a string
[04:37:01] <GreatPotato> Anybody recommend something other than flexslider?
[04:37:15] <GreatPotato> I always use it, maybe there is something better?
[04:56:42] <flexpaint> is toggle left supposed to come in from a northwest angle? or straight left?
[05:05:44] <sacho> what are you talking about?
[05:16:47] <Cork> flexpaint: are you talking about ui effects?
[05:25:26] <flexpaint> Cork, yes a menu button opening a nav
[05:25:45] <flexpaint> its coming from 10-11 o'lock instead of from the left
[05:25:53] <flexpaint> clock
[05:26:25] <Cork> flexpaint: the ui effects is a bit rigidity as far as i've experienced
[05:26:54] <Cork> so it depends heavily on what other css rules and elements you have if the effect works as intended
[05:32:37] <flexpaint> okay yeah i think its a css problem. thanks
[05:34:45] <wolfehr> hey guys, is anyone aware of a jquery plugin to facilitate sticky sections, where a bit of resistance is offered before escaping the section (specifically for mobile)? E.g. scroll down to bottom of a section, then a small amount of scroll will elastically rebound back to the section, if you scroll more, the section is escaped.
[05:35:40] <Cork> wolfehr: that is a really really REALLY hard thing to do with js
[05:36:07] <Cork> wolfehr: js gets informed about scrolls async in mobiles
[05:36:30] <Cork> and the browser can actually choose to just not fire the event for a while if it feels it would take too much time
[05:36:31] <mrbubbles> i should know this really, but can someone tell me why the resize doesn’t trigger the function? http://jsfiddle.net/3q4vu0nx/7/ (it’s working on page load)
[05:37:00] <Cork> mrbubbles: }();  <--
[05:37:14] <mrbubbles> Cork: to have it run on page load
[05:37:22] <wolfehr> Cork, thanks for the heads up, I’ll look at other options
[05:37:31] <Cork> ya, but you set the return value to setHeightOfParent not the function reference
[05:38:15] <Cork> wolfehr: a bit of a correction, it is fairly easy to do on desktop
[05:38:27] <Cork> wolfehr: and you can get something like it working on mobile
[05:38:31] <mrbubbles> ooh
[05:38:32] <wolfehr> Cork, it’s just for mobile, desktop already has another interface
[05:38:37] <mrbubbles> so what should I do instead?
[05:38:51] <Cork> but cause of the unreliable calling of the event you can't make it reliable
[05:39:12] <wolfehr> Cork, yeah, looks like there’s no point if isn’t consistent
[05:39:23] <Cork> mrbubbles: either call the function separately or .trigger()
[05:39:43] <Cork> mrbubbles: http://jsfiddle.net/3q4vu0nx/8/
[05:40:04] <mrbubbles> thanks :)
[05:40:21] <Cork> wolfehr: browsers are talking and experimenting with solutions for exactly this problem
[05:40:25] <Cork> but there isn't one currently
[05:40:48] <Cork> ui workers and a new css property as two competing solutions
[06:02:12] <DreamStiffler> Hi Uhkis and Cork was it that helped me with this the other day? I have this http://jsfiddle.net/eser3yaz/1/ . I am stuck as my coding sucks. I am trying to get this JSON to be inside each of the DIVs in the HTML. The DIVS are static, cannot be generating from the jquery. This is because the DIV will be generated by other scripts. So how do i put each of the data from the JSON into each of the DIVS?
[06:10:18] <randomguy> the divs will be created after that script runs?  or the scripts generating the divs will be ran before that script?
[06:11:49] <DreamStiffler> randomguy: im hoping the divs will be created before the scripts run
[06:16:14] <randomguy> DreamStiffler: guess i'm confused.  your fiddle looks to be putting the results in the divs already... ?
[06:17:35] <DreamStiffler> randomguy: it does. but the problem is, its putting all the results in each of the DIVS. What I actually want is that, to have each result in each DIVS. Get it?
[06:18:59] <DreamStiffler> randomguy: the results im getting is in the set of 5. Id like to separate these results to each one into each divs.
[06:19:04] <randomguy> DreamStifflet: so you want the NET ASSET VALUE(s) in one div and the Changes in Sub in the other?
[06:20:01] <DreamStiffler> randomguy: yes
[06:20:13] <randomguy> DreamStiffler: gotcha, lets see...
[06:24:59] <randomguy> DreamStifflet: btw while i'm looking at this, I should say I noticed in your url that your passing an sql statement, which from a security standpoint is very bad
[06:29:29] <DreamStiffler> sql? no sql there
[06:30:37] <mbrzuzy> I'm confused as to what you're trying to do man
[06:30:50] <mbrzuzy> You want the data inserted into the divs that are already there?
[06:31:15] <mbrzuzy> You would have to at least know the class of the divs or the parent div that all those are in
[06:32:08] <DreamStiffler> mbrzuzy: yes to each divs. I gotta go. ill check the fiddle later if its updates. to the last post. Thanks in advance guys. Ill try to join the channel back if possible. I hope you guys can help as im outta wits.
[06:32:13] <randomguy> http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select * from html where url=\'http://www.bursamalaysia.com/market/\' and xpath=\'//li[@class="bm_news"]\'&format=json&callback=?
[06:32:20] <randomguy> there's an sql statement in that url
[06:32:43] <DreamStiffler> thats sql?
[06:32:50] <DreamStiffler> the XXX is the YYYs parents
[06:33:04] <DreamStiffler> i really gotta go man ill try and get back in
[06:33:21] <randomguy> DreamStifflet: ok, possibly something like this   http://jsfiddle.net/eser3yaz/2/
[06:34:00] <randomguy> DreamStiffler: but that is a dirty way to do it.  it would be better if on the response you could put a class on them to use to know which div they need to go in.  as your response stands currently, you have to go off of the content
[06:34:33] <randomguy> DreamStifflet: the part in the url that says q=select * .... is an sql statement
[06:35:12] <randomguy> DreamStiffler: from a security standpoint that is very dangerious.  it presents the opportunity for sql injection into a website and also it provides information to potential hackers of your database structure
[06:52:19] <DreamStiffler> Back. On phone now
[06:52:46] <DreamStiffler> So what was it again?
[06:53:42] <randomguy> <randomguy> DreamStifflet: ok, possibly something like this   http://jsfiddle.net/eser3yaz/2/
[06:54:31] <randomguy> DreamStiffler: however it would be a better solution if you could alter the response to include something on the elements to use to differentiate, vs interogating the content
[06:58:54] <DreamStiffler> Randomguy: crap i cant view source on mobile. Will have to check on phone. I think i understant what youre saying. Basically check on divs instead of the content it self to separate the data in to each divs right? The thing is the response divs doesnt have different class names.
[06:59:25] <randomguy> DreamStiffler: not the divs, the response from the ajax
[07:00:28] <randomguy> afk a sec
[07:00:29] <DreamStiffler> Randomguy: yes response from ajax . Like if theres elements with ids in it right? Or class? To separate it?
[07:01:10] <DreamStiffler> Ok me afk too. Googling
[07:05:16] <DreamStiffler> I think i need to split the response data into arrays. But was thinking if the response is already like this maybe i can skip from making it an array.
[07:07:17] <Talon_> I have a couple questions about a jQuery UI custom widget. none of the examples deal with needing to find elements to "widgetize" lol for lack of better term. anyways, I wrote a fiddle that works like I want, I have a few comments for questions like should I store my needed elements in the options? etc... it's really short and simple, if someone could review it please and drop me a PM or
[07:07:18] <Talon_> highlight me it'd be greatly appriceated. http://jsfiddle.net/rey6sdda/
[07:07:33] <BulleTime> hi, i am using the jquery touchswipe script
[07:07:57] <BulleTime> but this wont work when a relative div is on top of the document
[07:08:11] <BulleTime> even i use $(document).swipe
[07:11:05] <randomguy> DreamStiffler: bak, one sec
[07:12:30] <randomguy> DreamStiffler: in your loop there is an attribute this.class which is "bm_news"
[07:13:10] <randomguy> DreamStiffler: if you could alter the response to make that different, such as "bm_news section1" or something, you could use that to interogate vs the content, which would be better
[07:48:53] <Valar_morghulis> Hi everyone,
[07:48:53] <Valar_morghulis> My name is Sachin and I am an undergrad interested in contributing to JQuery Foundation as part of GSoC 2015. I'd like to discuss about the project idea -
[07:48:53] <Valar_morghulis> Chassis - Create a theme for a CMS that implements Chassis. From what I understand from the description, a new base theme for either Drupal or Wordpress integrating the chassis base theme is required. Could someone please elaborate a bit more on how can i get started  and what else is needed   ?
[08:19:36] <ajf-> can you bind event handlers to elements before you insert them into the DOM?
[08:19:42] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[08:19:59] <robertmaxrees> you can use event delegation instead though.
[08:21:19] <snover> yes you can
[08:21:38] <robertmaxrees> well, you can while making the elements, sure.
[08:21:39] <robertmaxrees> but meh.
[08:21:49] <robertmaxrees> not before then.
[09:02:14] <bbclover> hey guys, if I have a select tag with some options, and I want to get the value of the option which has the selected attribute (i.e. <option selected="selected" value="something">The option</option>), how would I do that?
[09:02:28] <robertmaxrees> get the value of the select.
[09:03:16] <bbclover> ah yes, haha, thanks
[09:15:56] <Scriptonaut> hey guys, I'm having trouble disabling a button and getting it to also submit. If I do this: https://gist.github.com/robins35/7d27fb2225a1f610f66f     then it won't submit because I disabled it. If I put the disabled inside the submit, it doesn't disable it at all
[09:16:14] <Scriptonaut> any idea how I'm supposed to make it so when I click it, it begins submitting, and then disables it, to prevent people from submitting more than once
[09:17:13] <robertmaxrees> set a data attr on the form and check if it's set in the handler.
[09:17:46] <Scriptonaut> a data attribute that tells whether or not it's disabled?
[09:17:55] <robertmaxrees> no.
[09:17:56] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[09:18:39] <Utils> What's the best way to call a function xx seconds after a user has stopped typing (sort of for like a search) ?
[09:19:03] <Scriptonaut> setTimeout
[09:19:09] <Scriptonaut> is what I'd do, maybe not the best
[09:19:10] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut http://jsfiddle.net/9k2b0hos/ something like this.
[09:19:14] <robertmaxrees> Utils you want a debounce.
[09:20:49] <Scriptonaut> robertmaxrees: out of curiosity, why do you set $this
[09:20:52] <Scriptonaut> why not just use $(this)
[09:20:57] <Scriptonaut> does it change or something?
[09:21:05] <Scriptonaut> or is it more efficient
[09:21:42] <Utils> Scriptonaut: because otherwise you will be creating multiple objects each time you do $(this) , i believe that's the reason.
[09:21:50] <Utils> as opposed to only creating one object and assigning it to $this
[09:21:51] <robertmaxrees> i'm just used to doing it that way.  if you wound up needing to use it for other things, setting that once and using it multiple places is a little more efficient.
[09:21:58] <robertmaxrees> also, every call to $() is kind of expensive.
[09:22:08] <robertmaxrees> in this case, you don't really see the benefit.
[09:22:22] <Scriptonaut> ah, I wasn't aware you made new objects every time you called $(this)
[09:22:30] <robertmaxrees> any time you call $(), yeah.
[09:22:36] <robertmaxrees> $('div') does it, too.
[09:22:46] <Utils> robertmaxrees Never heard of a debounce before. I just had a google and found one taken from underscore.js. Just trying to understand it now.
[09:23:10] <robertmaxrees> actually it might not be a debounce i'm thinking of...
[09:23:10] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[09:23:12] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[09:24:15] <Utils> My idea is that when you finish typing, approximately 2 seconds after... it will execute a function. If you continue typing, then it will not execute that function... sort of thing.
[09:24:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah i know exactly what you want.
[09:24:54] <robertmaxrees> it'd be similar to this guy: http://jsfiddle.net/j7fb85sb/
[09:25:24] <robertmaxrees> that's for disabling mousehover events on scroll, but it should be trivial to change to suit your needs.
[09:25:55] <Utils> Oh yes, clearing timeout on keypress and creating a new one is what needs to be done. Don't know why I hadn't thought about that. Thanks, robertmaxrees !
[09:26:04] <Scriptonaut> hmm, so there doesn't seem to be an .on('submit'), at least in my browser
[09:26:10] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut sure there is.
[09:26:37] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you using?
[09:26:54] <Scriptonaut> very recent one
[09:27:04] <robertmaxrees> you sure?
[09:27:04] <Scriptonaut> it's rails, it's set to grab a recent one, I'll check though
[09:27:06] <robertmaxrees> i'd confirm.
[09:28:48] <Scriptonaut> jesus christ
[09:28:51] <Scriptonaut> it says I'm using 1.10.2
[09:28:53] <Scriptonaut> that can't be right
[09:28:59] <robertmaxrees> that's recent enough.
[09:29:07] <Scriptonaut> ohh
[09:29:09] <robertmaxrees> that's only one version behind.
[09:29:10] <Scriptonaut> I read that like 1.1
[09:29:13] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[09:29:38] <Scriptonaut> hmm, so I console.log inside that submit thing, and it doesn't print out
[09:29:41] <robertmaxrees> so then your event binding might be bad.  does the form exist on pageload?  are you targeting the form and not, say, the submit button?
[09:30:27] <Scriptonaut> I mean, it works when I do 'click'
[09:30:29] <Scriptonaut> just not 'submit'
[09:30:39] <Scriptonaut> nah, I was targeting the submit
[09:30:43] <Scriptonaut> maybe that's why
[09:30:55] <teknolust> anyone have experience with jquery magnific popups (image/video/map gallery popup) + .net implementation? I could use some help. Feel free to msg me if you have a free moment
[09:31:04] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ teknolust
[09:31:04] <b-ot> teknolust: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:31:15] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut the submit event comes from the form, not the submit button.  that's why.
[09:31:25] <Scriptonaut> ah, thanks
[09:31:33] <Scriptonaut> anything wrong with using a click?
[09:31:48] <robertmaxrees> you can submit forms without clicking anything.
[09:31:57] <Scriptonaut> oh, good point
[09:31:59] <teknolust> my issues: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28860835/google-analytics-jquery-magnific-popups-net-master-page-implementation
[09:32:33] <robertmaxrees> you're also not concerned with the action of clicking the submit button, you're concerned with submitting the form.
[09:33:14] <robertmaxrees> teknolust what is a "master page"?
[09:34:02] <robertmaxrees> also, "Google script fails to find script" is ephemeral.  what do you mean by that?
[09:34:11] <robertmaxrees> some clarificaction would be really helpful.
[09:34:12] <teknolust> master page is what my site is built off of. the idea being you can add header/footers to it which transfer to all content pages
[09:34:27] <robertmaxrees> aaaah i remember those.
[09:34:49] <robertmaxrees> so the scripts don't really care about the backend fwiw.
[09:34:59] <robertmaxrees> i'd check the rendered page to see if everything is where it should be.
[09:36:27] <teknolust> uhhh ok now i'm really conufsed.  I just ran it without changing anything, and everything is working. *baffled*
[09:36:37] <robertmaxrees> race conditions or caching probably.
[09:36:46] <teknolust> i have literally zero errors where I had tons before
[09:37:58] <teknolust> well, wonderful I'm going to get back at it I appreciate the help robert
[09:38:11] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[09:40:58] <teknolust> alright, so the "it's working" bit was my site's default page.  I've gone two directories deep (so it is still using the following code from the masterpage to call the script) but now I'm getting an error.
[09:41:02] <teknolust> code:   $('.test-popup-link').magnificPopup({type: 'image'});
[09:41:11] <robertmaxrees> what's the error?
[09:41:12] <teknolust> and error: Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[09:41:32] <robertmaxrees> you're not loading jquery on that page, or you're trying to load that code before jquery is included.
[09:42:00] <teknolust> double checking the loading of it
[09:42:32] <Scriptonaut> robertmaxrees: e.preventDefault() doesn't seem to be preventing multiple submits
[09:42:46] <robertmaxrees> then you're not doing something correctly.
[09:42:51] <Scriptonaut> let me gist my code
[09:42:55] <robertmaxrees> are you checking things server-side, as well?
[09:43:12] <robertmaxrees> like, what problem are you actually trying to solve?
[09:43:18] <Scriptonaut> https://gist.github.com/robins35/46e764399afba84c1f08
[09:43:35] <Scriptonaut> I don't want users to be able to submit multiple times
[09:43:42] <Scriptonaut> and I want to grey out/disable the button
[09:43:49] <robertmaxrees> i can disable javascript and submit multiple times
[09:44:10] <Scriptonaut> they wouldn't be able to submit at all without JS hah
[09:44:11] <Scriptonaut> it's remote
[09:44:42] <randomguy> anyone can generate a separate form script, or raw http request to perform a submit
[09:44:44] <robertmaxrees> can you fuiddle this up?
[09:45:07] <randomguy> you can't rely on the client
[09:45:10] <Scriptonaut> if they do many submits, it's not a security issue or anything, just bad user experience and I think it errors occasionally
[09:45:19] <robertmaxrees> sure, but it's not the end of the world.
[09:45:42] <robertmaxrees> as long as it doens't have any negative impact on the end user (and it shouldn't), it should be fine.
[09:45:55] <Scriptonaut> ya, but marketing department is telling me to not allow because lots of users are complaining that they double click and it errors out. Gotta keep customers happy heh
[09:46:01] <Scriptonaut> ok I'll try to fiddle
[09:46:08] <robertmaxrees> then you need to fix your backend.
[09:46:34] <teknolust> so in referencing my .net 4.0 book.  Seems I've got to add some ajax controls to add a scriptmanager which will allow me to use "~/Scripts" to get me back to the root. it's trying to call jquery in "/dir1/dir2/~/Scripts"
[09:46:36] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, http://stackoverflow.com/a/4473801/923919 this has a nice "plugin-ified" version of what i was suggesting.
[09:46:38] <teknolust> that will then properly load it
[09:46:52] <robertmaxrees> teknolust wut.
[09:47:12] <Scriptonaut> thanks robertmaxrees
[09:47:14] <robertmaxrees> what does ajax have to do with this?
[09:48:08] <teknolust> there's something called a scriptmanager in it (which I don't have enabled yet) that will allow me to properly call the script because right now just having this in my head is causing it to go to the wrong dir
[09:48:08] <teknolust> <script src="Scripts/jquery-2.1.3.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[09:48:35] <robertmaxrees> put a / in front of scripts
[09:48:45] <robertmaxrees> oh hah that won't fix it all though.
[09:48:58] <teknolust> actually, that did it
[09:49:00] <teknolust> *high5*
[09:49:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah okay i'm sick so my brain is a little mushy.
[09:49:45] <teknolust> does that only apply to the src field? href for example you don't have to put a / in front and it'll work fine.
[09:51:03] <teknolust> alright, food break then i'm back at it. thanks again you've saved me an immense amount of hassle
[09:51:06] <robertmaxrees> it depends on where you're trying to accomplish.
[09:51:14] <teknolust> ah gotcha
[09:57:43] <Omar-> grrr
[09:57:52] <jakesy_> roar
[09:58:02] <Omar-> I will never master .filter()
[09:58:11] * Omar- scratches jakesy
[09:58:18] <arschmitz> snarl?
[09:58:22] <jakesy_> whats wrong with filter?
[09:58:30] <robertmaxrees> .filter() is so easy!
[09:58:55] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/fustpwpp/ this is piece of the code
[09:59:08] <Omar-> full demo http://jsbin.com/retaji
[09:59:24] <Omar-> image | video | link
[09:59:48] <Omar-> when two are checked and one unchecked, the filter doesnt work well
[10:00:07] <Omar-> .ui-screen-hidden == display: none
[10:00:24] <Omar-> arschmitz have you read my msg of yesterday?
[10:00:48] <arschmitz> something about hidedurringfocus?
[10:01:00] <Omar-> yea arschmitz
[10:01:02] <arschmitz> iv been busy i have not really looked at it
[10:01:41] <Omar-> arschmitz its okay. and another issue, that when navigation's direction is back, data.options.reverse = false; doesn't work
[10:02:06] <Omar-> jakesy / robertmaxrees ive posted links of the code
[10:02:22] <jakesy_> yeah but doesnt filter use a selector?
[10:02:39] <jakesy_> like .filter( "[data-type]" ) or something
[10:02:44] <Omar-> jakesy I use .data("type") where type is stored
[10:02:46] <Omar-> yup
[10:03:12] <robertmaxrees> you can also use a function for filter
[10:03:51] <Omar-> jakesy http://jsfiddle.net/9vjsxh0z/ line 26
[10:04:21] <Omar-> robertmaxrees the concept works, but I dont know why it fails after unchecking all and then checking them again
[10:04:55] <robertmaxrees> i'ma be totally honest and say that i'm not going to be able to parse through the full example, and the code without context isn't really going to work for me.
[10:04:57] <jakesy_> ah its a reddit bot? lol
[10:05:28] <Omar-> robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/fustpwpp/ this is filter code
[10:05:41] <Omar-> jakesy yes, just for funz ;)
[10:05:42] <robertmaxrees> right.
[10:05:47] <robertmaxrees> reread what i said ;)
[10:05:56] <jakesy_> http://jsfiddle.net/fustpwpp/1/
[10:05:56] <randomguy> can you add some html to go with that filter code?
[10:06:07] <robertmaxrees> a self-contained example would be nice.
[10:06:16] <Omar-> ok :/
[10:06:23] <Omar-> stay tuned
[10:06:24] <Omar-> :P
[10:07:09] <jakesy_> ive never had .data work properly for me. I think im cursed
[10:07:35] <robertmaxrees> Omar- you're mixing and matching type vs val.
[10:12:17] <Omar-> robertmaxrees checkboxes values matches data type (image,video,link)
[10:12:41] <Omar-> now the sample isnt working
[10:16:23] <Omar-> arschmitz: http://jsfiddle.net/pqsdtd54/ why is it throwing an error?
[10:16:37] <Omar-> where on the main demo it works well
[10:16:52] <robertmaxrees> check your console homie.
[10:17:33] <Omar-> robertmaxrees exact same code in main demo.
[10:17:36] <Omar-> Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on listview prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'refresh'
[10:17:40] <robertmaxrees> right.
[10:17:45] <kiuma> hello, how can I manipulate and html data given by an ajax call ? is it possible do use the callback data attribute as a dom  ?
[10:17:51] <Omar-> anyway
[10:17:55] <Omar-> i'll be back later
[10:17:59] <Omar-> take care guys
[10:18:01] <Omar-> talk to you soon
[10:18:19] <robertmaxrees> kiuma yeah - .done(function(data) { $(data).find('.someClass') }); or whatever
[10:19:07] <kiuma> ah ok it's normal stuff, thanks robertmaxrees
[10:20:45] <jakesy_> http://jsfiddle.net/fustpwpp/2/ ?
[10:20:54] <jakesy_> Omar-
[10:21:24] <robertmaxrees> he already left.
[10:21:37] <jakesy_> aww. but I made his forEach into a map. I never get to do that
[10:22:26] <randomguy> huh, never seen the map function
[10:23:34] <jakesy_> back in the day I loved map so much I used to do it for operations with an indeterminate amount of iterations
[10:24:16] <randomguy> so its similar to the groovy collect() I take it?
[10:24:40] <robertmaxrees> .map() "transforms" one array into another.
[10:24:55] <randomguy> yep, nice
[10:26:16] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sh1xyrtp/ and all that.
[10:29:57] <jakesy_> woah! I did groovy for a few months
[10:30:03] <jakesy_> it lives up to its name
[10:30:17] <jakesy_> the project I was on though, could not say the same
[10:30:26] <randomguy> its the big push at my workplace, going from java to that
[10:33:23] <jakesy_> did you look at 1.8? i hear it's pretty coolio. the thing I didn't like about groovy is that when I went in and explicitly typed everything I got reprimanded for it
[10:34:04] <jakesy_> 80% of my development life I've been doing javascript. Sometimes I just want to be a little verbose
[10:34:35] <randomguy> haven't looked at the new stuff.  all i know is people are waiting to see what happens with grails  being dropped by their sponser to see who picks them up next
[10:38:23] <jakesy_> do people really program in non-monospaced fonts? that sounds terrifying
[10:39:46] <Scriptonaut> robertmaxrees, I just realized why e.preventDefault wasn't working. It's a remote form. Anyone know how to prevent a remote post?
[10:39:57] <dcherman> jakesy_:  terrifyingly awesome.  you aren't a real developer until you program in comic sans.
[10:39:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:40:08] <Scriptonaut> the form .on('submit')
[10:40:10] <Scriptonaut> the submission is ajax
[10:40:18] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[10:40:18] <Scriptonaut> I think that's why e.preventDefault doesn't work
[10:40:21] <robertmaxrees> eh.
[10:40:23] <robertmaxrees> it should.
[10:40:26] <Scriptonaut> hmm
[10:40:33] <Scriptonaut> what could I do to determine why it's not
[10:40:43] <robertmaxrees> you're triggering the ajax on submit, right?
[10:40:48] <randomguy> dcherman: a real developer codes in wingdings
[10:40:59] <Scriptonaut> I assume, it's using rails
[10:41:08] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut... your code for the ajax submit.
[10:41:10] <Scriptonaut> I just set remote to true in the form builder and it uses it's rails.js engine
[10:41:23] <robertmaxrees> you need to check what the frontend is doing.
[10:41:23] <Scriptonaut> I don't write code for ajax submit
[10:41:39] <Scriptonaut> ah, k
[10:44:06] <ajf-> Can I execute a certain js file gotten with .getScript with a certain context? like, if I want to pass parameters to it, and then in the js file have function(params){} ..
[11:01:31] <jqueryhhelp> Hello all
[11:03:36] <jqueryhhelp> Do you know some game to do fast in jquery?
[11:04:34] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[11:15:27] <mrbubbles> jqueryhhelp: guess the number is a pretty easy game to do in jquery
[11:15:44] <mrbubbles> computer picks a number, prompts you to guess, tells you if you’re right or wrong
[11:16:20] <mrbubbles> if you want to make it really fun you can add clues (higher/lower)
[11:21:05] <jqueryhhelp> mrbubbles Thank you very much for your answers :) . I will try that game then, it's appear easy, thanks :)
[11:43:02] <rubyonrailed> How can I check if a form field is disabled?
[11:43:13] <robertmaxrees> .prop('disabled')
[11:43:56] <rubyonrailed> robertmaxrees: Thanks
[11:45:39] <rubyonrailed> Is there a good resource for jquery styling guide.  I feel like my jquery looks like a giant mess right now.  Or a good article on refactoring jquery
[11:45:44] <rubyonrailed> that anyone knows of
[11:45:56] <robertmaxrees> rubyonrailed you want info on javascript.
[11:46:53] <rubyonrailed> Ok
[11:46:59] <ajf-> I want to convert all h1's to h2's, h3's to h4's, h5 to h6's, and h6's to <p style="font-weight:bold"></p>. What's a good approach for this ?
[11:47:29] <robertmaxrees> ajf- use your server do it?
[11:47:36] <robertmaxrees> why do you want to do that?
[11:47:52] <ajf-> because I'm using an API that returns crappy html
[11:48:34] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/replacewith/
[11:48:37] <teknolust> i'd find and replace in VS throughout your entire solution
[11:48:46] <teknolust> if you're using vs
[11:48:55] <robertmaxrees> sounds like he's not in control of the API.
[11:49:32] <ajf-> robertmaxrees: thanks
[11:50:13] <dcherman> ajf-: all of them ever?  just define CSS rules to  make them look like you want
[11:50:41] <robertmaxrees> he said that it's from a bad api y'all.
[11:50:50] <robertmaxrees> bad heading tags can cause SEO headaches.
[11:51:37] <dcherman> might be a site where SEO doesn't matter.  hasn't been specified.
[11:51:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:55:48] <arup_r> I want to add a checkbox instead of plain text here inside the <td> .. How to do so ? https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/3edd6445597845d4cb86#file-kitchen-js-L7 see the sample HTML
[11:56:33] <robertmaxrees> .html('<input type="checkbox">some text</input>')
[11:57:35] <arup_r> how can I add data.name and data.weekend values there
[11:57:52] <robertmaxrees> .html('<input type="checkbox">' + data.name + '</input>')
[11:57:54] <robertmaxrees> etc
[11:58:01] <arup_r> https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/3edd6445597845d4cb86#file-sample-html-L1
[11:58:03] <arup_r> ok
[11:58:03] <robertmaxrees> javascript string concatenation
[11:58:09] <arup_r> humm
[11:59:43] <arup_r> robertmaxrees:  How would I handle the checked attribute value ? As data.weekend will give either true or false
[11:59:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:59:54] <arup_r> humm
[12:00:02] <robertmaxrees> you want to set checked based on data.weekend?
[12:00:03] <arup_r> it is coming from backend
[12:00:10] <arup_r> yes :)
[12:00:36] <arup_r> weekend is boolean DB column
[12:00:51] <robertmaxrees> probably something like '<input type="checkbox"' + (data.weeend ? 'true' : 'false' ) + '></input>'
[12:01:26] <arup_r> Ok.. JS also has ternary stuff
[12:01:34] <arup_r> any Pro way  ? :p
[12:01:34] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:01:53] <robertmaxrees> should've been '<input type="checkbox"' + (data.weeend ? 'checked' : '') + '></input>'
[12:01:59] <robertmaxrees> and what do you mean "pro way"
[12:02:10] <arup_r> nothing.. advance way :p
[12:02:22] <robertmaxrees> that IS the advanced way.
[12:02:32] <arup_r> Ok. I know you are Pro
[12:02:35] <robertmaxrees> and the "smart" way given what you're trying to do.
[12:02:58] <arup_r> but why you did not use checked= <then the conditional expr> ?
[12:03:11] <robertmaxrees> it's a boolean attribute.
[12:03:27] <robertmaxrees> <input type="checkbox" checked></input> is all you need.
[12:03:38] <arup_r> ok..
[12:03:53] <robertmaxrees> you can also do <input type="checkbox" checked=true></input> if you want, but the existence of the attribute is what matters.
[12:04:01] <arup_r> Browser is showing like -- <td class="weekend"><input checked="checked" disabled="disabled" id="weekend" name="weekend" type="checkbox" value="Wroclaw" /></td>
[12:04:20] <robertmaxrees> sure
[12:04:29] <robertmaxrees> it'll work, but boolean attributes need only exist/
[12:04:38] <robertmaxrees> go check out the docs on MDN if you don't believe me.
[12:04:40] <arup_r> ok
[12:04:49] <arup_r> I do trust you :(
[12:04:58] <arup_r> that's why I came here
[12:05:20] <arup_r> Just asking.. asking questions is my bad habbit
[12:05:46] <robertmaxrees> questions are fine.
[12:08:21] <arup_r> '<input checked=' + data.weeend + 'disabled="disabled" id="weekend" name="weekend" type="checkbox" value=' + data.name + '/>'
[12:08:31] <ajf-> How can I find empty tags (or with &nbsp; as content)
[12:08:31] <ajf-> ?
[12:08:32] <arup_r> this is the string I built.. now let me test it
[12:08:51] <robertmaxrees> arup_r '<input checked=' + data.weeend + ' disabled="disabled" id="weekend" name="weekend" type="checkbox" value=' + data.name + '/>'
[12:09:01] <robertmaxrees> need to make sure the output string has the right spaces in it.
[12:09:14] <robertmaxrees> ajf- .filter() could do that
[12:09:27] <ajf-> thanks
[12:15:48] <arup_r> robertmaxrees: mean ?
[12:16:18] <robertmaxrees> <input checked=truedisabled="disabled"> - that's what your code would've done
[12:16:37] <arup_r> ok
[12:16:45] <arup_r> got it.. Good good point
[12:21:28] <arup_r> robertmaxrees: I updated the code.. https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/3edd6445597845d4cb86#file-kitchen-js-L7 even if weenend is false  checkbox are being displayed as checked.
[12:21:42] <robertmaxrees> boolean attributes ;)
[12:21:50] <robertmaxrees> don't write them out if you don't need them.
[12:22:08] <jqueryhhelp> Hello all
[12:22:13] <jqueryhhelp> I have a question
[12:22:39] <arup_r> robertmaxrees: didn't get you
[12:22:39] <arthurvr> Feel free to ask jqueryhhelp!
[12:22:41] <robertmaxrees> arup_r http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0pmhvmsy/ this is what i was trying to explain earlier.
[12:22:49] <arup_r> ok
[12:22:52] <arup_r> let me see
[12:23:21] <jqueryhhelp> I don't know exactly What is the difference between jQuery and JavaScript
[12:23:30] <robertmaxrees> jquery IS javascript.
[12:23:50] <jqueryhhelp> Ahhh ok
[12:23:50] <robertmaxrees> javascript is a programming language, while jquery is a library that makes it easier to use javascript in web pages.
[12:24:23] <jqueryhhelp> Ok ok
[12:25:09] <jqueryhhelp> But Can I do same things in Javascript and jQuery?
[12:25:14] <arup_r> ok.. Humm.. I need to use data.weekend.toString()
[12:25:27] <robertmaxrees> jqueryhhelp i'm not sure what you mean.
[12:25:30] <BillCriswell> If you're doing it in jQuery you're doing it in Javascript.
[12:25:34] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:26:05] <cjohnson> <
[12:26:16] <jqueryhhelp> I have a game: guess the number
[12:26:34] <cjohnson> 2
[12:26:36] <cjohnson> not, 9
[12:26:46] <jqueryhhelp> In Javascript and I need convert to jQuery
[12:27:00] <robertmaxrees> why would you "convert" it?
[12:27:07] <robertmaxrees> and remember - jquery IS javascript.
[12:27:37] <cjohnson> jqueryhhelp: it might help if you pasted your code and asked specific questions
[12:27:45] <arup_r> me ? robertmaxrees :
[12:27:45] <cjohnson> about what you're wanting to change or do differently
[12:27:46] <jqueryhhelp> Turn Javascript code to jQuery
[12:27:50] <BillCriswell> Do you have the submit or change events done in Vanilla JS? The logic would be the same no matter what.
[12:27:55] <robertmaxrees> arup_r i was talking to somebody else.
[12:28:00] <arup_r> ok
[12:28:10] <robertmaxrees> jqueryhhelp can you show us what you mean?
[12:28:21] <jqueryhhelp> Ok
[12:28:30] <robertmaxrees> maybe explain "why", as well.
[12:28:39] <arup_r> didn't work -- '<input checked=' + data.weekend.toString() + ' disabled="disabled" id="weekend" name="weekend" type="checkbox" value=' + data.name + ' />'
[12:29:00] <jqueryhhelp> Just a moment please
[12:29:15] <robertmaxrees> arup_r i don't know what data.weekend or data.name are, and "didn't work" doesn't tell me anything.
[12:29:18] <robertmaxrees> fiddle it.
[12:29:19] <arup_r> check boxes are being shown as checked while I can see weekend is false
[12:29:36] <robertmaxrees> arup_r i already explained this.
[12:29:50] <robertmaxrees> you can't have checked="anything" in there if you don't want it to be checked.
[12:29:52] <cjohnson> arup_r: console.log the resulting string and look at it, it wil lbe more obvious to you what's going on
[12:30:00] <arup_r> humm,, that's why I used to_String()
[12:30:00] <BillCriswell> What is data.weekend anyway?
[12:30:07] <robertmaxrees> arup_r... that doesn't matter.
[12:30:20] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0pmhvmsy/
[12:30:29] <arup_r> data.weekend is true or false
[12:30:34] <arup_r> BillCriswell:
[12:30:34] <BillCriswell> arup_r: toString will always return something truthy (for a checked attribute)
[12:30:35] <robertmaxrees> see how this has checked="false"?
[12:30:38] <robertmaxrees> and it's still checked.
[12:30:50] <arup_r> Ohh
[12:31:06] <arup_r> so how would I handle this false case ?
[12:31:18] <robertmaxrees> i showed you how earlier with the conditional.
[12:31:20] <BillCriswell> Don't add the checked attribute at all unless it's true.
[12:31:21] <jqueryhhelp> This is my code: https://jsfiddle.net/9uf8y9uv/
[12:31:47] <arup_r> ok
[12:31:56] <jqueryhhelp> It's the guess the number game
[12:32:06] <cjohnson> jqueryhhelp: do you have any particular reason to switch to jquery here? if you have code that has no dependencies it's generally not desirable to arbitrarily add them
[12:32:17] <robertmaxrees> jqueryhhelp are you trying to learn jquery?
[12:33:26] <BillCriswell> arup_r: You can do like $('<input id="weekend" type="checkbox" disabled>').prop('checked', data.weekend).val(data.name);
[12:33:39] <jqueryhhelp> Yes, I'm trying to learn jQuery, I need to do a simple game in jQuery
[12:33:49] <robertmaxrees> jqueryhhelp http://learn.jquery.com/ start here.
[12:33:51] <jqueryhhelp> And this game appear easy to do in jQuery
[12:34:29] <robertmaxrees> jqueryhhelp how much programming experience do you have?
[12:35:05] <jqueryhhelp> One year approximatelly
[12:35:16] <BillCriswell> jqueryhhelp: Down to the second?
[12:35:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:35:29] <jqueryhhelp> I have knowledge in HTML, Javascript, CSS
[12:35:33] <robertmaxrees> yeah, start with the learning center.
[12:37:40] <jqueryhhelp> Ok, I will see after. Then Can I do that? Put that javascript code in jQuery
[12:38:26] <BillCriswell> jqueryhhelp: You want to convert the code before you look at the learning center?
[12:40:54] <jqueryhhelp> I saw an example of the game (stackoverflow): http://jsfiddle.net/VBNQq/ and it appear easy
[12:41:05] <arup_r> getting error "Uncaught TypeError: boolean is not a function"  when I tried this -
[12:41:07] <arup_r> kitchen_row.find('td.weekend').html('<input disabled="disabled" id="weekend" name="weekend" type="checkbox" value=' + data.name + (data.weekend ? " checked" : "") ' />')
[12:41:09] <jqueryhhelp> In jQuery
[12:41:27] <robertmaxrees> arup_r fiddle it pls
[12:41:34] <arup_r> ok
[12:41:37] <BillCriswell> arup_r: You missed a +
[12:41:40] <BillCriswell> but yeah, fiddle it.
[12:41:43] <robertmaxrees> oh yeah that to.
[12:42:23] <arup_r> how can I fiddel with the conditional check ?
[12:42:32] <manrajsingh> Hi. I would like to know about SciJS GSoC project and how I can contribute. Also please share mailing list link as I was not able to locate it. :)
[12:42:55] <robertmaxrees> manrajsingh no clu what you're talking about
[12:43:08] <robertmaxrees> google summer of code?
[12:43:30] <manrajsingh> Yeps :)
[12:43:54] <robertmaxrees> oh... not the right channel for that i don't think.
[12:44:07] <u_name_> anyone in here familiar with shapeshiftjs?
[12:44:15] <u_name_> (draggable masonry)
[12:44:27] <robertmaxrees> i give up on today hahahaha
[12:44:53] <manrajsingh> Yeah I know I tried contacting them on their channel but I see its quite inactive.
[12:45:14] <arup_r> not working :(
[12:45:26] <arup_r> kitchen_row.find('td.weekend').html('<input disabled="disabled" id="weekend" name="weekend" type="checkbox" value=' + data.name + (data.weekend ? " checked" : "") + ' />')
[12:45:37] <robertmaxrees> manrajsingh so you came to a completely unrelated channel?
[12:45:46] <cjohnson> arup_r: you didn't do what he said
[12:45:59] <cjohnson> and you put it in the value?
[12:46:42] <manrajsingh> robertmaxrees: I came to a parent channel :)
[12:47:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?  arthurvr is jquery involved with the google summer of code somehow?
[12:47:09] <arthurvr> Yes.
[12:47:21] <arup_r> In fiddle how would I write like data.weekend ?
[12:47:37] <robertmaxrees> good to know!  where should we be directing requests like this?
[12:48:01] <arthurvr> to the right IRC channel preferably
[12:48:05] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[12:48:12] <robertmaxrees> that's kind of what i was thinking :)
[12:48:14] <BillCriswell> arup_r: http://jsbin.com/babize/1/edit?html,js,output
[12:48:21] <arthurvr> if you don’t know the right ones per project, redirect them to #jquery-dev
[12:49:04] <manrajsingh> I do know but its quite inactive :/ Could you help me with mailing list if there is one?
[12:49:35] <u_name_> arthurvr: what's the difference between jquery-dev and jquery?
[12:49:53] <u_name_> building versus consuming?
[12:49:55] <arthurvr> manrajsingh: You tried #scijs?
[12:49:59] <arthurvr> u_name_: totally right.
[12:50:10] <u_name_> k
[12:50:38] <manrajsingh> arthurvr: Yes I have tried asking thrice but no reply.
[12:50:45] <arthurvr> u_name_: also there is #jqueryui-dev for ui and mobile, #jquery-content for sites/docs, #css-chassis for chassis, …
[12:50:58] <robertmaxrees> manrajsingh what mailing list are you referring to?
[12:51:24] <u_name_> I'm looking for help with a library called jquery.shapeshift
[12:51:33] <arup_r> BillCriswell: that should work.. Let me try
[12:51:34] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ u_name_
[12:51:34] <b-ot> u_name_: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:51:34] <manrajsingh> robertmaxrees: SciJS mailing list or GSoC related mailing list.
[12:52:03] <u_name_> !ask @ robertmaxrees
[12:52:03] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:52:21] <robertmaxrees> manrajsingh yeah, we wouldn't know anything about either of those in here - a quick google search gave me http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2015/help_page#1._What_are_the_program_mailing_lists
[12:52:24] <robertmaxrees> that might help?
[12:53:07] <arthurvr> manrajsingh: I wouldn’t even know if they have a mailing list :-) I pinged somebody in #scijs, hope it helps :)
[12:53:48] <manrajsingh> robertmaxrees: Thanks. Will have a look at it.
[12:54:36] <manrajsingh> arthurvr: I have done that already. Two of the three mentors are away and one is busy, I guess.(Not complaining)
[12:55:32] <arthurvr> manrajsingh: Sorry to hear that. I’d reccomend to stick around in the channel a bit and wait till people are around.
[12:55:45] <arthurvr> manrajsingh: some are online but not actually around, you know
[12:56:43] <manrajsingh> arthurvr: Yeah, I guess I would have to wait. Is there any jquery mailing-list I could follow?
[12:57:46] <arthurvr> manrajsingh: not #scijs specific I know about. If you want to get involved with jQuery in general, contribute.jquery.org, the forums and the github repos :)
[12:58:38] <arthurvr> manrajsingh: jQuery moved away from a quite a bunch of mailing list and transitioned to forums.
[12:58:51] <robertmaxrees> for the better imo
[12:58:58] <arthurvr> Sure!
[12:59:56] <arthurvr> I’m away for like 10 minutes but feel free to ask if there are other questions, manrajsingh
[13:00:09] <manrajsingh> arthurvr: Yeah I would love to. Could've started with #scijs, they don't really have any issues.
[13:00:30] <manrajsingh> arthurvr: Yeah will do. Thank you so much for your time. :)
[13:00:39] <arthurvr> manrajsingh: You’re welcome!
[13:00:54] <manrajsingh> robertmaxrees: Thanks to you too! :)
[13:01:25] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[13:03:38] <arup_r> getting error -- :( Huhh http://goo.gl/f6tPCa
[13:04:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:07:54] <arup_r> No idea.. where is the mess
[13:08:33] <robertmaxrees> i have no clue.
[13:08:37] <robertmaxrees> open your console maybe?
[13:08:55] <robertmaxrees> it's coffeescript so it's hard to know.
[13:09:50] <arup_r> I fixed it.. by random space http://goo.gl/Bm7yoR :)
[13:10:04] <robertmaxrees> whitespace is important in coffeescript iirc
[13:10:22] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: yeah it kind of is :)
[13:10:34] <arup_r> frustating
[13:10:37] <robertmaxrees> how they define blocks, right?
[13:11:17] <arthurvr> dunno who writes coffee anymore? lol :)
[13:11:18] <StanAccy> Is it possible to target an element by id thats defined in the <head> block?
[13:11:27] <arthurvr> StanAccy: sure
[13:11:28] <arup_r> I don't know.. I write JS first and then convert it.. kind of hacking.. I don't understand this coffee
[13:11:43] <u_name_> so I have this fiddle
[13:11:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:11:46] <u_name_> http://jsfiddle.net/LNysC/2719/
[13:11:57] <u_name_> I can't figure out how to trigger a re-sort in this library
[13:12:17] <u_name_> 1000 kewpie dolls to victor
[13:12:28] <StanAccy> arthurvr: Im trying to target a <script> element (similar to how handlebars does) in order to debug some other app.  The regular $('#mytemplate') is not finding the element
[13:12:42] <robertmaxrees> StanAccy do you have multiple elements with the same ID?
[13:12:46] <StanAccy> nope
[13:13:12] <StanAccy> double checked - just the 1 id with that name
[13:13:34] <robertmaxrees> u_name_ doesn't look like that plugin supports it?
[13:13:47] <arthurvr> StanAccy: just to be sure, script elements have some rare edges, what are you exactly doing with it?
[13:14:10] <arup_r> it is adding 2 checkboxes.. append is the culprit
[13:14:12] <arup_r>  $('<input id="weekend" type="checkbox" name="foo" disabled/>').prop('checked', data.weekend) .val(data.name).appendTo(kitchen_row.find('td.weekend'))
[13:14:16] <StanAccy> arthurvr: Im just trying to grab the text content of a div defined inside that script element. Or maybe even just the script itself. Purely debugging
[13:14:23] <arthurvr> e.g. You can’t use html() on a <script> tag
[13:14:37] <StanAccy> I was doingL $('template1').find(
[13:14:40] <StanAccy> .find(
[13:14:46] <arup_r> for each click one checkbox is getting added..
[13:14:46] <u_name_> robertmaxrees: unfortunately no, but it has the closest functionality that I'm looking for out of all of the libraries. I looked at it's source, and it looks like it has an internal 'render' function that does what I want. But it looks like the reference to the object is lost in the ether.
[13:14:49] <StanAccy> .find('mydiv').text();
[13:15:08] <robertmaxrees> u_name_ right, so you might have to hack the plugin or find something else.
[13:15:51] <arthurvr> StanAccy: yeah just wanted to be sure. You’ve got a reduced testcase?
[13:16:06] <StanAccy> yeh, very much reduced.  Ill throw it on jsfiddle
[13:16:16] <arthurvr> StanAccy: thanks
[13:16:39] <u_name_> robertmaxrees: :|
[13:17:06] <StanAccy> how do I put elements in tot he head on jsfiddle?
[13:17:29] <arthurvr> good question actually :)
[13:17:40] <arthurvr> anyways now I will really have to leave guys
[13:17:50] <arthurvr> StanAccy: I’m sure somebody else will be able to help you
[13:18:36] <quuxman> I'm having some perplexing basic HTML trouble with: <a href='page2' target='viewbox'>Page2> .... and <iframe src='title' name='viewbox'>
[13:18:57] <robertmaxrees> quuxman i'd ask in #html
[13:18:57] <StanAccy> http://jsfiddle.net/5md4n1dn/1/
[13:19:13] <StanAccy> How could I get access to the 'mydiv' text ?
[13:19:14] <quuxman> When Page2 link is clicked, it appears in viewbox iframe, but when inspecting viewbox with console or jquery, the src attribute remains as 'title'
[13:20:19] <quuxman> robertmaxrees: yes, it is an HTML problem, but I thought it was an interesting one, and #jquery tends to be a lot more savy
[13:20:48] <robertmaxrees> quuxman just giving a suggestion of where you'e likely to get faster help ;)
[13:21:47] <robertmaxrees> StanAccy start with this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5md4n1dn/6/
[13:22:56] <StanAccy> robertmaxrees: so is there a way to access the inner elements using standard jquery selectors (when defined within a script tag like that)?
[13:23:15] <robertmaxrees> StanAccy http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5md4n1dn/8/ this is the jquery-fied #mydiv object.
[13:24:16] <StanAccy> so I can only access the contents of the script as a text blob, and then I need to wrap it inside of a jquery object before I can access anything further
[13:24:26] <robertmaxrees> as far as I know, yes.
[13:24:33] <robertmaxrees> which is what you were getting at earlier.
[13:24:37] <robertmaxrees> also notice the change to that script tg.
[13:24:39] <robertmaxrees> *tag
[13:25:05] <u_name_> that feeling when you facepalm so hard
[13:25:22] <u_name_> robertmaxrees: $('.container').trigger('ss-rearrange')
[13:25:27] <u_name_> it's in the documentation
[13:25:27] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[13:25:34] <robertmaxrees> oh hah
[13:28:02] <StanAccy> robertmaxrees: I still cant access the div within that script block, even after passing the html into jquery
[13:28:16] <robertmaxrees> huh? i'm doing it in that fiddle.
[13:28:36] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5md4n1dn/15/
[13:29:02] <StanAccy> Ah,. never mind - I was finding the element on itself (which didnt find anything)
[13:29:11] <StanAccy> robertmaxrees: Thanks for the help
[13:29:14] <robertmaxrees> boom :)
[13:29:27] <arup_r> robertmaxrees: help me https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/913b1ba134832929b484
[13:29:37] <yottabyte> what's a nice, succinct way to make an ajax get? it's something like $.ajax(url, data = {x: x}).success(function).error(function)?
[13:29:44] <arup_r> after checking the checkbox it is coming as uncheked
[13:29:50] <robertmaxrees> .done() and .fail(), yottabyte
[13:29:58] <robertmaxrees> arup_r fiddle it dude.
[13:30:12] <StanAccy> yottabyte: $.get()
[13:30:26] <robertmaxrees> there' also $.get(), $.post(), etc.
[13:31:59] <arup_r> this is a huge html how would I put there
[13:32:07] <robertmaxrees> a small, self-contained example.
[13:32:31] <arup_r> http://jsfiddle.net/qtkLxyf1/
[13:32:31] <robertmaxrees> or tell me which line you're hving a hard time with.
[13:32:54] <robertmaxrees> copy/pasting code from a gist to a fiddle isn't what i mean...
[13:33:02] <robertmaxrees> lol a functional example duder.
[13:33:18] <robertmaxrees> otherwise i need more details from you.
[13:33:35] <arup_r> kitchen_row.find('td.weekend #weekend').replaceWith('<input id="weekend" type="checkbox" name="weekend" disabled/>').prop('checked', data.weekend).val(data.name);
[13:34:26] <Demonicpagan> i'm trying to debug some web issues and am wondering if a site has jquery 1.7.1 in their header and this is using an iframe on its page and that iframe is using jquery 1.7.2 that the 1.7.1 version takes precedence on the entire site?
[13:34:35] <arup_r> I am clicking on the checkbox to uncheck it.. and DB value got changed but the Ajax is not showing as unchecked..
[13:35:14] <robertmaxrees> arup_r i have no idea what your data looks like.
[13:35:33] <arup_r> simple JSON
[13:35:38] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:35:46] <robertmaxrees> i literally can't help you without seeing more.
[13:35:47] <u_name_> simple (wink wink)
[13:35:59] <arup_r>  { name: @kitchen.name, id: @kitchen.id, weekend: @kitchen.weekend }
[13:36:00] <robertmaxrees> Demonicpagan no.
[13:36:09] <robertmaxrees> arup_r that's still not helpful.
[13:36:12] <robertmaxrees> what does the JS see?
[13:36:23] <robertmaxrees> Demonicpagan the iframe is a "sandbox" so-to-speak.
[13:36:28] <arup_r> this is data
[13:36:39] <robertmaxrees> arup_r @kitchen.name isn't getting to the browser.
[13:36:42] <robertmaxrees> that's invalid data
[13:36:47] <Demonicpagan> i wonder why IE is doing what it is doing then on this site i'm trying to debug
[13:37:02] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem you're trying to solve?
[13:37:27] <arup_r> this is I am sending from backend to the data var { name: @kitchen.name, id: @kitchen.id, weekend: @kitchen.weekend }
[13:37:44] <robertmaxrees> no it isn't.
[13:37:55] <Demonicpagan> when going to this site, https://www.adventureaquarium.com/occ, user inputs a barcode and clicks continue. in IE the user doesn't progress on with a valid barcode, but in chrome and firefox they can
[13:38:24] <Demonicpagan> instead in IE, the box is cleared
[13:38:45] <robertmaxrees> arup_r http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/LyLy0pku/
[13:39:48] <robertmaxrees> Demonicpagan https://shop.omniticket.com/AAQ/activate/index.cfm what happens if you do it here instead?
[13:40:27] <Demonicpagan> the user can continue as they should
[13:40:43] <robertmaxrees> do you work for omniticket?
[13:40:46] <Demonicpagan> i do
[13:41:02] <robertmaxrees> alright.  let's take a look then.
[13:41:48] <arup_r> let me use console.log(data)
[13:42:14] <robertmaxrees> Demonicpagan there's a good chance they've got some code elsewhere causing headaches.
[13:42:54] <Demonicpagan> baffles me that the issue only occurs in an IE iframe. i tried looking at the developer console and no errors are displayed (other than their mismatched <p></p> where they put their redirect link to not use the iframe
[13:44:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah, something tells me they've got some JS doing something it shouldn't.
[13:44:22] <robertmaxrees> either way, iframes are "sandboxed" - the version of jquery in the iframe exists separately from the one in the main window.
[13:44:55] <u_name_> test
[13:45:10] <robertmaxrees> we can see you, u_name ;)
[13:45:24] <u_name_> :p
[13:45:29] <u_name_> u_name: test
[13:45:50] <u_name_> I'm trying to get notifications to work in Adium for irc
[13:46:13] <robertmaxrees> might want to create a separate channel to test in, then.
[13:47:02] <arup_r> robertmaxrees:  see this -- http://s23.postimg.org/zacioyopn/js_issue.png all data is coming from backend well but the Ajax is not working I checked it from UI.. console saying.. bit it is displaying as unchecked
[13:47:39] <robertmaxrees> dunno homeslice.
[13:49:07] <arup_r> means ?
[13:49:21] <robertmaxrees> i don't know how to help you at this point.
[13:49:27] <robertmaxrees> i've given you examples and things to look at.
[13:49:41] <robertmaxrees> i can't replicate the problem you're having.
[13:49:45] <robertmaxrees> so it's really hard for me to help.
[13:51:49] <u_name> arup_r: what error do you get?
[13:52:19] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 check this site out.
[13:54:19] <mrkie> hey
[13:55:00] <robertmaxrees> yo
[13:56:46] <arup_r> robertmaxrees: working.. I missed the $() one
[13:56:59] <arup_r> thanks for all your helps
[14:03:46] <Aikar> does .clone(true, true) only work for events bound with jquery?
[14:04:05] <BillCriswell> 5:04, eh
[14:04:18] <Aikar> I'm trying to move a vendor div to another location and im losing the event handlers :/
[14:08:10] <u_name> Aikar: are you sure the events are not bound to the parent?
[14:08:29] <Aikar> i am moving a node at the root of body
[14:08:37] <Aikar> which in chrome i can see its bound to that node
[14:08:46] <u_name> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[14:08:55] <Aikar> for better context.... LivePerson button
[14:15:27] <Aikar> screw it, i'm just binding a new click handler that calls .click() on the hidden version
[14:16:40] <u_name> Aikar have you tested your hypothesis?
[14:17:07] <Aikar> that my idea will work? yes it does
[14:17:48] <u_name> no, the events only getting picked up if they were set with jquery
[14:18:23] <Aikar> I had seen many suggestions on how to copy events using .data('events'), but thats empty for me
[14:18:29] <Aikar> since the vendor doesnt use jQ to do it
[14:19:58] <u_name> Have you messed with .detach()?
[14:20:14] <u_name> I fear you might run into the same problem, but maybe it's worth a shot, I donno
[14:21:39] <u_name> Aikar: did you see this already? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/559147/are-events-lost-in-jquery-when-you-remove-an-element-and-append-it-elsewhere
[14:22:15] <Aikar> hmm, does that "move" the element"?
[14:22:36] <Aikar> well im actually happier with newer method, as I dont have to undo the vendors dom structure/style attributes
[14:22:39] <Aikar> easier to style
[14:23:32] <u_name> http://okely.dokely.neighborino.jpg.to
[14:25:39] <u_name> Aikar: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/cyrdfx5m/
[14:27:01] <Aikar> k well good to know
[15:33:12] <EminenceHC> I am trying to fire an action if ALL three values have a value of "0", when any of the fields change. How can I transform this code to achieve that? : https://gist.github.com/EminenceHC/3343e222f98dfe303dd9
[15:33:54] <EminenceHC> I am looking to replace $(this).val() with something like $(all).val()
[15:34:27] <neanderslob> EminenceHC: having a look right now
[15:34:38] <EminenceHC> neanderslob: Thanks
[15:37:10] <neanderslob> EminenceHC: alright, so you'd want to use a forEach loop to iterate through each variable; I'll write a gist for you
[15:39:33] <robertmaxrees> you could could $.fn.map() it and then use Array.prototype.some();
[15:41:00] <EminenceHC> neanderslob: Thanks, I am guessing the foreach would fire the event, and the foreach would be triggered when any value changes?
[15:41:09] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[15:41:51] <neanderslob> EminenceHC: the loop would be triggered on change
[15:42:00] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: are you advising against using a loop?
[15:42:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah, no need to.
[15:42:35] <robertmaxrees> let me show you what i'm thinking.
[15:42:41] <robertmaxrees> EminenceHC what sort of browser support do you need?
[15:42:50] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: please do I might learn something too
[15:43:10] <neanderslob> EminenceHC: I'll post my solution still just for the heck of it
[15:43:37] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: Full, preferably. Mainly Chrome and IE though.
[15:43:46] <robertmaxrees> how far back for IE, I mean
[15:44:01] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: 8-9?
[15:44:46] <robertmaxrees> meh, okay
[15:46:47] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/chj23aqo/
[15:46:49] <robertmaxrees> can do this instead.
[15:47:47] <robertmaxrees> basically, get an array of all of the values and work against that if you don't care about which control has which value.
[15:50:04] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: Yeah it doesn't matter which control has which value. I am showing a div if any of those three fields has a == "1", which is easy and I can do that singularly, but where your code might come in, is hiding that div again if ALL three values happen to change back to == "0"
[15:50:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so go this route.
[15:53:13] <robertmaxrees> i'd even abstract out the whole $.inArray('2', getAllValues()) bit into a function called something like allValuesValid or something.
[15:56:46] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: I am having some difficulty transforming that code to my specific use case, what do you think is wrong with this? : https://gist.github.com/EminenceHC/3343e222f98dfe303dd9
[15:57:44] <robertmaxrees>  $(varAlcohol & varMarijuana & varElse); for starters.
[15:58:46] <neanderslob> EminenceHC: here's my looping solution for what it's worth https://gist.github.com/BigMcLargeHuge/8b7763ce61aa637a7b8a
[15:59:11] <robertmaxrees> btw neanderslob that's not an array youu're declaring up top :)
[15:59:57] <robertmaxrees> also forEach doesn't work in IE8
[16:00:23] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: no, you're right; it's an object my bad :-P
[16:00:30] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: really, good to know
[16:00:38] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: what loop would you use instead?
[16:00:39] <robertmaxrees> EminenceHC var $select = $(varAlcoho).add(varMarijuana).add(varElse), instead
[16:00:45] <robertmaxrees> you don't "loop" ever.
[16:01:30] <robertmaxrees> forEach and stuff is fine though.
[16:02:34] <robertmaxrees> descriptive vs prescriptive and all that.
[16:03:16] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: I see, the second time I am using it: $(varAlcohol & varMarijuana & varElse).on('change'   -- should that be simply: $select.on('change' ?
[16:03:32] <robertmaxrees> if you declare it that way, yes.
[16:03:36] <EminenceHC> neanderslob: Thanks, I am going to try it out just so I can see how both approaches work.
[16:03:57] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: Using $select = $(varAlcoho).add(varMarijuana).add(varElse) it is declared that way right?
[16:04:15] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[16:21:19] <_BigWings_> my $(window).mousedown doesn't register a middle mouseclick
[16:21:40] <_BigWings_> $(window).mouseup  DOES register a middle mouse up though
[16:21:49] <_BigWings_> any idea what that could be anyone?
[16:22:52] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wfq8jo2j/ works fine here.
[16:23:20] <_BigWings_> yes
[16:23:25] <dn5> guys.. for some reason $('#adbl').fadeOut('slow').css('background-color', 'transparent'); fade out whole div
[16:23:44] <_BigWings_> I guess something else is snatching the message and killing it?
[16:23:57] <robertmaxrees> _BigWings_ that's possible.
[16:24:38] <u_name> dn5: are you trying to fade the background?
[16:24:47] <_BigWings_> could it be anything else?
[16:24:49] <dn5> u_name: yep
[16:25:04] <robertmaxrees> _BigWings_ i'd need to see it failing.
[16:25:35] <_BigWings_> myeah.. its part of a very big complicated website.. its not easy to show an example
[16:25:35] <u_name> dn5: http://api.jquery.com/fadeout/ fadeOut does exactly that
[16:25:42] <u_name> (fade the element)
[16:25:49] <robertmaxrees> dn5 you're fading out #adbl
[16:26:00] <u_name> Maybe you need to do some css transition something
[16:26:02] <_BigWings_> is there a way to see which event handlers are firing when you click somewhere?
[16:26:08] <_BigWings_> in firebug or chrome
[16:26:27] <dn5> robertmaxrees: I want to fadeout() only background-color, not the text on the div
[16:26:32] <robertmaxrees> _BigWings_ you can see which events are bound to which elements in both of those.
[16:26:37] <robertmaxrees> dn5 then use .animate()
[16:27:08] <dn5> robertmaxrees: that is a built in function?
[16:27:19] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:27:38] <dn5> robertmaxrees: yep I just saw, let me try
[16:29:08] <dn5> robertmaxrees: background-color can not be animated using .animate()
[16:29:42] <robertmaxrees> for that you'll need either jquery UI or the color plugin
[16:30:20] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color
[16:30:30] <dn5> yep
[16:31:20] <dn5> damn.. any other way around?
[16:31:35] <robertmaxrees> not without hacking things.
[16:32:06] <dn5> I'm interested in second (hacking).. shall I wrap another div around or?
[16:32:26] <dismist> hack deez
[16:32:26] <dn5> I really avoid plugins for such a simple action that I will use only once
[16:32:53] <robertmaxrees> it's 4k compressed and minified - you could easily compress an image and make that up ;)
[16:33:13] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, create a div that you use as your background and animate the transparency on that maybe?
[16:34:01] <u_name> dn5: http://jsfiddle.net/e85avfhj/
[16:34:03] <dn5> hmm.. let me try
[16:34:22] <robertmaxrees> or css transitions, depending on browser support.
[16:35:24] <dn5> u_name: thats a real hack, let me try to fit it in my project
[16:35:52] <robertmaxrees> that's actually not a hack >.>
[16:36:28] <u_name> til css transitions are hacks
[16:36:37] <dn5> it's another way after all without using .animate or other jquery functions, it's css
[16:36:50] <robertmaxrees> but it's not a hack ;) just be aware that browser support might not be ideal.
[16:37:03] <_BigWings_> i looked in firebug and disabled all other things on mousedown.. still no luck with catching middle mouse button click.. only release
[16:37:08] <dn5> depends on how you look at it.. yea ofc
[16:37:16] <u_name> dn5: http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-transitions
[16:37:18] <robertmaxrees> dn5 not really.
[16:37:32] <robertmaxrees> _BigWings_ i'd have to see it in action then.
[16:37:32] <u_name> doesn't work with IE8,9 and Opera Mini
[16:38:38] <dn5> u_name: it's ok, this is for my own needs
[16:40:12] <_BigWings_> k found it
[16:40:17] <_BigWings_> $('body').mousedown(function(e){if(e.button==1)return false});
[16:40:18] <robertmaxrees> what was it?
[16:40:24] <robertmaxrees> that'll do it.
[16:40:27] <_BigWings_> I had that at the top of my page to prevent it from scrolling
[16:41:15] <_BigWings_> got rework that then
[16:41:18] <dn5> u_name: Is it possible to transition onload when document is ready?
[16:41:32] <robertmaxrees> dn5 just run that code on document ready.
[16:41:43] <robertmaxrees> _BigWings_ why would you prevent the ability to scroll?
[16:42:31] <dn5> for some reason, it does a transition without fade animation http://jsfiddle.net/e85avfhj/1/
[16:43:00] <_BigWings_> cuz I am making an editor and i'd like to not scroll the page when im middle dragging the mouse on my editor viewport
[16:45:16] <u_name> dn5: it faded for me?
[16:45:42] <dn5> u_name: interesting
[16:46:03] <u_name> did you try clicking run?
[16:46:07] <robertmaxrees> same here
[16:46:26] <dn5> u_name: ofcourse ..
[16:46:37] <u_name> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[16:46:38] <dn5> I even treid to change time of transition
[16:46:40] <robertmaxrees> what happens?
[16:46:42] <dn5> let me try firefox
[16:46:52] <dn5> robertmaxrees: nothing.. it's transparent on the run
[16:47:06] <robertmaxrees> any console errors or anything?
[16:47:21] <dn5> firefox works, might be up to the chrome
[16:47:44] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[16:48:00] <dn5> robertmaxrees: no console errors but when debugging function is runned
[16:48:17] <u_name> what if you change transparent to white?
[16:49:11] <dn5> u_name: same; it's setting that color without the fade.. let me try to update it on new link
[16:51:01] <u_name> dn5: what about this? http://jsfiddle.net/e85avfhj/5/
[16:51:48] <dn5> u_name: same, tho it works fine in firefox
[16:51:57] <dn5> u_name: could be up to browser?
[16:52:11] <dn5> u_name: but the first one worked... one sec
[16:52:39] <dn5> u_name: the first one still works fine
[16:53:13] <u_name> http://jsfiddle.net/e85avfhj/6/
[16:54:21] <dn5> u_name: that works!
[16:54:30] <u_name> cool
[16:54:32] <dn5> u_name: what did you add here, a delay?
[16:54:37] <u_name> yea
[16:54:48] <dn5> u_name: nice, I did not think about that
[16:54:56] <dn5> u_name: thank you !
[16:54:58] <u_name> np
[16:55:07] <u_name> do me a favor though
[16:55:09] <u_name> try this: http://jsfiddle.net/e85avfhj/7/
[16:55:10] <robertmaxrees> oh the extra iife around it.
[16:56:02] <u_name> robertmaxrees: part of the deduction process, it's just a remnant
[16:56:24] <robertmaxrees> oh the timeout.  i get it.
[16:57:15] <u_name> it's nonsense, but it seems to work for him
[16:57:27] <robertmaxrees> it's chrome being chrome.
[16:59:23] <u_name> http://this.is.true.jpg.to/
[17:07:35] <dn5> u_name: why you didn't ping me, this works fine too
[17:14:07] <u_name> np
[17:58:49] <furoido> hello #jquery
[17:58:52] <furoido> https://dpaste.de/Tt1p this validates only on second click submit
[18:03:19] <u_name> are you saying the beforeSend only gets executed on second click?
[18:03:41] <u_name> furoido
[18:04:13] <furoido> u_name: $(this).validate();
[18:04:29] <furoido> the This field is required
[18:04:36] <furoido> on my frontend
[18:05:45] <furoido> also it still submits even now validation was done
[18:08:35] <u_name> I think you're using the validate wrong
[18:08:43] <u_name> http://jqueryvalidation.org/validate/
[18:09:30] <u_name> validate takes a hash, one of the parameters is submitHandler which is executed on successful validation
[18:11:03] <u_name> and I think the addClassRules needs to happen before you do the validation
[18:11:08] <u_name> otherwise there's no rules
[18:14:58] <furoido> so yeah, i think validation only applies when i submit, it doesnt get executed immediately
[18:15:05] <furoido> but this somehow worked $("form#contactform").validate().on('submit', function(e) {
[18:15:37] <u_name> but you still need to click it twice right?
[18:15:45] <u_name> (assuming you refreshed the page)
[18:16:20] <furoido> with the current syntax. no
[18:16:35] <furoido> it gets required when i submit now
[18:16:49] <furoido> apparently,
[18:16:50] <furoido> was broken
[18:16:50] <furoido>  e.preventDefault();
[18:20:04] <u_name> furoido: just out of curiosity does this work?
[18:20:04] <u_name> https://dpaste.de/CkyX#L16,20,29
[18:21:25] <u_name> also, it's useless testing if the response was success for the ajax, because it will always be successful (it's the success handler)
[18:21:42] <u_name> the error code belongs in the error handler
[18:23:33] <furoido> not it didnt worked.
[18:24:01] <furoido> what i did, $("form#contactform").validate(); $("form#contactform").on('submit', function(e) {
[18:24:06] <furoido> and it worked fine
[18:24:14] <furoido> not sure if its best practice
[18:25:58] <u_name> I'm sure it's not done optimally, but I don't have experience with the validation library
[18:26:41] <u_name> but make sure to fix your ajax hash otherwise you won't be able to catch the error
[19:40:06] <frogFeet> Hey all. I've got a js file in the header of my index.html. $("document").ready(function() { $('#coursedates').load('coursedates.html');
[19:40:11] <frogFeet> $("document").ready(function() { $('#coursedates').load('coursedates.html');
[19:40:26] <frogFeet> It load the content for a div as above.
[19:40:46] <frogFeet> How do I then manipulate the dom of that div loaded by jquery?
[19:41:43] <frogFeet> The div I want has a unique ID, but this doesn't work to insert content into it. $("[id=coursedates-tab]").click(function() { $('#datesEdit').load('datesEdit.html');
[19:42:40] <frogFeet> Am I missing something obvious, or is there something tricky you need to do to edit a part of the DOM which was created after page load by JQuery? Thank you.
[20:03:37] <brad1121> frogFeet
[20:05:41] <brad1121> $('#coursedates-tab').on('click',function(){});
[20:06:20] <brad1121> $('body').on('click','#coursedates-tab',function(){});
[20:49:50] <hesco1> Might I get some guidance please on a jquery question from a backend coder?  https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=PeVOpJnUdx
[20:50:30] <hesco1> why is this not rendering the webform provided in that .load() call?
[20:50:46] <hesco1> Am I writing this correctly?  or is this a CORS issue?
[21:09:02] <NABrown> has anyone used TinySort?
[21:11:09] <frogFeet> @brad1121: Thank you muchly.
[21:25:35] <Uhkis> hesco1: a) https + http don't mix b) cors
[23:15:23] <sadtaco> Is there some way to have jquery autocomplete list the unmatched items and just highlight the matched ones?
[23:16:39] <Cork> sadtaco: sure, are you using a remote or local source?
[23:16:57] <frogFeet> Hey all. I'm loading a file into a div using JQuery. I'm then loading another file into that div using more JQuery.
[23:16:59] <sadtaco> local
[23:17:18] <sadtaco> I want the matched results at the top and highlighted, and the unmatched ones underneath.
[23:17:28] <frogFeet> index.html: <div id="file1"></div>
[23:17:49] <frogFeet> file1.html: <div id="file2"></div>
[23:18:11] <frogFeet> file2.html: raw text
[23:18:34] <frogFeet> How to I get the browser to grab the new version of file2.html in this example?
[23:18:52] <sadtaco> Um.. an ajax request?  Have no idea what you're asking.
[23:19:16] <Cork> sadtaco: give a function instead of the array and then use the highlight function (think that exist in the demo page) and use that on all "matches"
[23:20:19] <frogFeet> It works if I use 'Empty Cache & Hard Reload' in Chrome.
[23:20:40] <sadtaco> I'm using a resolver function, yeah.  Oh haha nevermind. I'm so dumb. :/
[23:20:45] <Cork> ?paste @ frogFeet
[23:20:45] <b-ot> frogFeet: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:21:09] <frogFeet> Okay @Cork.
[23:23:28] <frogFeet> @Cork, does JSFiddle support multiple html files? I need to reference two html files in JQuery.
[23:23:47] <Cork> it does, but you don't have to do that
[23:23:52] <Cork> just include the code you use
[23:28:46] <frogFeet> Okay @Cork I'm not sure if that's what you wanted but I've tried here: http://jsfiddle.net/791Lb1n3/
[23:29:28] <frogFeet> The courseDates.html file contains a div with the id "datesEdit".
[23:31:04] <Cork> frogFeet: http://jsfiddle.net/791Lb1n3/1/
[23:31:25] <Cork> frogFeet: you're hitting the cache
[23:31:37] <Cork> and that is why you don't get the new data
[23:32:13] <Cork> .load doesn't have a built in solution for avoiding the cache
[23:32:18] <Cork> so you have to do that manually
[23:32:25] <Cork> ($.ajax provides it though)
[23:39:20] <frogFeet> @Cork: Thank you, I'll look into using .ajax rather than .load.
[23:39:35] <frogFeet> Or the manual method.
[23:39:37] <Cork> frogFeet: $.ajax basically do the same thing i did there
[23:40:23] <Cork> you could use $.ajaxSetup too, but that will affect all ajax calls until you change the setup so... not a good choice
[23:44:02] <imolorhe> Hi
[23:46:10] <imolorhe> I know we are all jquery fans here but would you consider not using jquery in developing an application that doesn't need to support old browsers giving the size of the jquery library gzipped and minified?
[23:47:06] <tw2113> YES
[23:47:12] <Cork> imolorhe: ya
[23:47:13] <tw2113> sorry, caps log
[23:47:18] <tw2113> lock*
[23:47:46] <tw2113> have you looked at jQuery 2.x as well? which doesn't have the IEOld support
[23:47:47] <Cork> imolorhe: jquery is nice if you need to do a lot of dom modifications
[23:48:02] <Cork> but it is more cause of it shorting the function names
[23:48:12] <Cork> and you can do that in a much smaller lib
[23:48:47] <imolorhe> Cork: I saw a site recently that made me reconsider using jquery altogether
[23:49:20] <tw2113> do what's best for your needs
[23:49:40] <Cork> imolorhe: event handler delegation and $.each is the two big reasons i use jquery
[23:49:41] <imolorhe> www.youmightnotneedjquery.com
[23:49:50] <imolorhe> Hmmm
[23:50:03] <Cork> also that said, i never use jquery for extensions for example
[23:50:18] <Cork> and i'm not joined to the hip with jquery :()
[23:50:20] <Cork> *:)
[23:50:21] <imolorhe> ForEach takes care of $.each right?
[23:50:33] <Cork> kinda but not really
[23:51:00] <frogFeet> Oh thank you @Cork. I did not see the jsfiddle you posted. Yes I decided to go with an Ajax request so as not to pollute my server log with +DateTime urls.
[23:51:12] <Cork> you could do something like Object.keys(z).forEach(function(key) { var value = z[key]; })
[23:51:25] <Cork> but that is a lot longer then $.each(z, function(key, value) {})
[23:51:38] <Cork> and messier
[23:52:07] <Cork> frogFeet: uh, $.ajax does the same thing
[23:52:33] <Cork> frogFeet: if you don't want to send the _=timestamp part you would have to reconfigure the server to send a no-cache header for the html file
[23:53:14] <Cork> imolorhe: there is also the problem with arguments and dom collections
[23:53:25] <frogFeet> Cork: Ah okay. Thanks for letting me know. I'll just wear it then. I'd prefer to keep my website files as server-config-agnostic as possible.
[23:53:25] <Cork> so $.each is still nice to have
[23:54:21] <Cork> frogFeet: basically the only thing js can do is make sure the url is always unique so it gets a new cache position in the browser
[23:54:30] <Cork> frogFeet: only the server can prevent it from getting cached
[23:58:23] <imolorhe> Cork: hmmm OK thanks
[23:58:48] <sadtaco> Well I have another problem, how can I change what the selected value for jquery autocomplete?  Like say something is clicked, and for whatever reason I want to add '!' to the end of it.  How can I change the value between the list item being clicked and it actually changing the input field?
[23:59:16] <sadtaco> ah I can preventDefault() on select
[23:59:18] <Cork> sadtaco: the select event
[23:59:23] <Cork> event/callback
[23:59:58] <sadtaco> Hm? Callback? What callback?
