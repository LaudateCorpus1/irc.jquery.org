[01:28:49] <Cork> slight adjustment dataType sets the http Accepts header, it is what mime type ajax will ask the server for
[01:29:33] <Cork> so if you ask for json, but the server responds with html and correct content-type, it will still be handled as text
[16:15:34] <Es0teric> hi, does anyone have a library that allows a search of json data by value?
[17:26:01] <kirua> hi
[17:26:31] <kirua> i want to transform this small condition in js to jquery : https://pastebin.com/88Ff0YBB
[17:34:04] <pavonia> jQuery used to have UA detection, but it was removed, IIRC
[19:18:13] <jonfen> when doing an .each on an 'ul' for all the 'li' tags -- how do i query the result for a specific element id?
[19:33:47] <noahmg123> I'm trying to use `.remove()` but it isn't working.  `$(selector1).find('selector2').remove()` works, but`$(selector1).remove('selector2')`doesn't.
[19:34:10] <noahmg123> I'm trying to use `.remove()` but it isn't working.  `$(selector1).find(selector2).remove()` works, but`$(selector1).remove(selector2)`doesn't. *
[19:34:35] <noahmg123> ignore the quotes around `selector2`, that was a typo
[20:11:24] <dw1> does it accept arguments
[20:11:32] <dw1> jonfen: if it has an id you prob wouldnt need to
[20:12:17] <dw1> but each works like .each(function(index,el){ })
[20:12:34] <dw1> so you could do like $(el).hasClass('something')
[20:12:35] <dw1> or so
[20:12:36] <dw1> i thin
[20:12:37] <dw1> k
