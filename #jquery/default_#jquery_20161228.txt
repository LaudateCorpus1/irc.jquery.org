[09:09:48] <edlinde> hi guys, anyone know of a good bootstrap template for setting up a webpage for a university researcher
[09:09:55] <edlinde> so more like a cv really
[09:14:51] <edlinde> anyone?
[09:58:11] <KnightsOfNi> How do you get the height of the entire browser window? WHen I dynamically append some content in a div, it adds the scrollbar if it doesn't fit, but when then doing $(document).height(); it only gives the height of the visible area, not taking into account the extra height added by the content
[09:58:40] <taplar> possibly $(window).height()
[10:01:31] <randomnoob> Hello guys. Please tell how to find the technique https://demo.mageewp.com/onetone/ uses? I mean the effects while scrolling
[10:01:34] <KnightsOfNi> that also gives the visible height only
[10:02:12] <Navid_> Hello guys. Anybody can answer this question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41312786/remove-link-on-scroll. It has  bounty worth +50
[10:03:36] <taplar> Navid_: i gave you a starting point yesterday.  have you not done anything with it?
[10:04:37] <Navid_> Yeah I have tried many things but cant make it :( Thats why I added 50+ to see if someone can help me
[10:04:57] <Navid_> can't move forward and Done different things but nothing works
[10:05:02] <taplar> so what are you having difficulty with?
[10:06:38] <decx> what's the point in removing buttons
[10:07:22] <Navid_> If you look at this answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41312786/remove-link-on-scroll#answer-41313351
[10:07:50] <decx> jesus
[10:07:52] <Navid_> its good but for static. For dynamic it doesnt work so well
[10:07:57] <decx> hardcode everything
[10:08:30] <Navid_> I cant use IDs for selector since IDs changes
[10:08:33] <taplar> Navid_: what are you having difficulty with in creating a solution for this?
[10:08:44] <decx> use bootstraps navbar function
[10:08:52] <decx> it has this scroll linked event built in
[10:08:59] <Navid_> I use this for a gallery page, so when you click Next, it scrolls to next image
[10:09:23] <Navid_> Yeah I know, but it needs IDs to be exact like that and can't be change
[10:09:39] <Navid_> so I maybe should have classes for selector
[10:09:57] <taplar> which the fiddle i shared had
[10:10:03] <taplar> and your ignoring my question
[10:10:39] <Navid_> Sorry can you ask again. didnt see it
[10:10:47] <taplar> scroll up
[10:12:24] <Navid_> I have for difficulty and removing the links
[10:12:32] <taplar> that's the problem
[10:12:40] <taplar> not what you are having difficulty with in solving it
[10:12:52] <taplar> you have to break it down in to pieces and solve them one at a time
[10:13:00] <taplar> so describe your problem
[10:14:00] <Navid_> okei. First I have 4-8 links in a page and 4-8 divs. What I want to achieve is to when user scrolls down to first div, first link get removed etc.
[10:14:17] <taplar> how do you know when you have scrolled down to the first div?
[10:14:20] <Navid_> What I do now, is that when scroll to first div, all links gets removed
[10:15:01] <Navid_> All the div have same ID:.each-img and I use;   var div = $('.each-img').offset().top;
[10:15:11] <Navid_> $(window).scroll(function() {         var scrollTop = $(this).scrollTop();
[10:15:29] <taplar> so what do you check with scrollTop?
[10:17:39] <Navid_> if .each-img is on top
[10:17:54] <taplar> what does that mean?
[10:17:59] <Navid_> But I need to make it so it remove one links at a time and not all
[10:19:56] <decx> use bootstrap scrollspy ffs
[10:20:15] <decx> apparently you arlready use bootstrap
[10:20:19] <decx> it's not rocketscience
[10:20:36] <shoky_> Navid_: i gave you an answer now that does the same but dynamically..
[10:21:44] <Navid_> _decx could you send me me bootstrap link please
[10:22:08] <Navid_> _shoky, where is the asnwer?
[10:22:27] <Navid_> saw it
[10:22:34] <Navid_> Cant it be for dynamic?
[10:22:36] <decx> it's in the docs
[10:23:28] <Navid_> is it this: https://jsfiddle.net/rc0v2zrw/
[10:23:44] <shoky_> Navid_: yes
[10:24:14] <Navid_> And it works for dynamic right? So I dont need any ID selector?
[10:24:40] <shoky_> it'll work for any number of links yes
[10:24:51] <Navid_> great I will give it a try now
[10:24:51] <shoky_> you still need the ID and HREF to match
[10:26:52] <taplar> i was thinking https://jsfiddle.net/wc0cdfhv/7/
[10:28:12] <shoky_> i just literally took the other answer there and just made it dynamic instead of fixed ids. definitely not the ideal solution
[10:28:39] <taplar> yeah, mine will never hide #4 since it will never scroll all the way up
[10:29:22] <taplar> so Navid_ you have a couple examples of partial solutions.  now you get to improve them.
[10:30:18] <taplar> which you need to do, or ask questions about particular issues you are having.  us giving you a complete solution doesn't help you learn
[10:31:01] <decx> https://jsfiddle.net/rc0v2zrw/1/+
[10:31:03] <decx> https://jsfiddle.net/rc0v2zrw/1/
[10:31:10] <decx> add styles, apply directly to the forehead
[10:51:28] <ChDUP> Hi
[10:51:57] <taplar> grettings
[10:52:10] <taplar> or greetings even
[10:52:50] <ChDUP> greetings :-)
[10:53:15] <ChDUP> please I have problem with event.target
[10:53:24] <ChDUP> https://jsfiddle.net/hh4hszdp/3/
[10:53:41] <ChDUP> I would like the class CriterionOen to be added to the div .toggle
[10:54:03] <ChDUP> now , itâ€™s added to the <span>
[10:54:25] <MassDebates> great stuff, now wait for these masters of jqwerty to teach/advise/help/consult
[10:55:44] <taplar> you will probably have to do something like $(event.target).closest('.toggle').addClass()
[10:55:57] <taplar> since the target appears to be whatever was actually originally clicked
[10:57:14] <ChDUP> great
[10:57:15] <ChDUP> https://jsfiddle.net/hh4hszdp/4/
[10:57:23] <ChDUP> thank you very much taplar
[10:57:45] <taplar> err, stick $(event.target) in a var and reuse it to be a little more D.R.U
[10:57:51] <taplar> D.R.Y*
[10:58:10] <taplar> there is irony there some where
[10:58:44] <MassDebates> H-hey!
[10:58:46] <MassDebates> What about me?
[10:58:56] <MassDebates> I'm just as important. I'm the guy that GAVE YOU taplar!
[10:58:57] <taplar> hmm?
[10:59:08] <taplar> oh, lol
[10:59:08] <ChDUP> hey, great thanks too MassDebates :-)
[10:59:13] <MassDebates> Kickass
[10:59:48] <MassDebates> I wonder if I could apply for IRC secretary/operator
[10:59:52] <MassDebates> Like telephones back in the day.
[11:00:05] <MassDebates> "Operator! I need help with jquery, and FAST! Follow that taxi!"
[11:00:26] <taplar> then someone creates a bot and history repeats itself
[11:00:34] <MassDebates> Bots are impersonal
[11:00:49] <MassDebates> nobody likes bots when talking to their cable provider's customer service.
[11:00:59] <MassDebates> That's where a human touch is necessary.
[11:01:01] <MassDebates> Like meeeeeeeeee
[11:01:01] <Howdy_McGee> Anyone have suggestions for a continuous infinite smooth-scrolling plugin? The only decent one I've found so far is 3+ years old https://github.com/tkahn/Smooth-Div-Scroll
[11:01:14] <MassDebates> ahahahaha
[11:01:46] <MassDebates> I think there's a custom scrollbars thing that also modifies smoothness of ze scroll
[11:02:21] <MassDebates> You might be able to grab just the piece that makes it smooth and keep the native appearances n whatnot
[11:03:14] <MassDebates> Ah, it was simplebar but I was wrong, no smoothness of scroll. Sorry
[11:03:39] <taplar> what is the concern with smoothness?
[11:03:53] <Howdy_McGee> I'm more looking for a carousel, infinite, always scrolling slowly through items.
[11:04:25] <MassDebates> hm, have you found any direct issues with that smooth div scroll?
[11:04:29] <MassDebates> (besides age)
[11:05:18] <MassDebates> hm, I remember someone in #css asking about horizontal scrolls for a while - he wanted to recreate the thing that mountain dew had and he wanted to allow the scrollwheel to scroll through the horizontal carousel
[11:05:19] <Howdy_McGee> I haven't tried it yet, I was more worried about mobile issues if anything
[11:05:33] <MassDebates> Mobile, imo, is actually pretty easy with sidescrolling smoothness
[11:05:48] <MassDebates> Most of the native touch interactions are pretty forgiving with performance load
[11:06:09] <MassDebates> Have you considered doing a device sandbox test?
[11:08:35] <taplar> for some reason that last statement made me think of an old stereotypical jewish mother commenting on her programmer son
[11:08:46] <taplar> "It's ok, you go have fun playing in your sandbox."
[11:09:34] <MassDebates> lol
[11:10:09] <MassDebates> "Its okay dear, have fun playing in your little sandbox while I schlepp over to the pharmak"
[11:10:56] <taplar> what's a pharmak?
[11:11:22] <MassDebates> Pharmacy/Market
[11:11:29] <taplar> ah
[11:11:36] <taplar> is that yiddish or slang?
[11:11:37] <MassDebates> schlepp is what I consider stereotypical jewish motherspeak for 'head on over to'
[11:11:44] <MassDebates> Oh hell idk
[11:11:46] <MassDebates> I'm not jewish
[11:11:52] <MassDebates> Could be shit I just made up.
[11:11:58] <taplar> lol, k
[11:11:58] <MassDebates> Yeah, we'll go with that one.
[11:15:05] <MassDebates> y'know
[11:15:16] <MassDebates> Making a smooth scroll thing wouldn't be so tough I think
[11:15:20] <MassDebates> For infinite stuff
[11:15:33] <MassDebates> Why not just have jquery actively modify the css of the elements in the wheel?
[11:15:38] <MassDebates> Not by class
[11:15:43] <MassDebates> but like in a gradient type way
[11:15:59] <MassDebates> Then you'll be able to pick up both scroll and wheel-click events at your leisure.
[11:16:21] <MassDebates> I suspect it'd be pretty easy, especially with all of those pure css examples out there.
[11:16:41] <MassDebates> no doubt many of them have a great starting setup point, but they simply just didn't know how to or didn't want to use jquery.
[11:17:00] <MassDebates> @ Howdy_McGee You should check that out. The one you linked is pretty broken for many native user interactions
[11:17:26] <Howdy_McGee> I'm entirely open to a css solution. The biggest issue is infinite - when do you remove elements to save on space?
[11:17:40] <Howdy_McGee> Yeah I'm playing with it now trying to get it to at least function with the latest versions of jquery
[11:17:53] <MassDebates> At the back of the wheel, of course!
[11:18:03] <MassDebates> Or, wherever, really. It won't be in view.
[11:18:36] <MassDebates> What I'm suggesting is start off with one of those pure css solutions you find on codepen, and modify it with some jqwerty
[11:50:40] <ChDUP> thanks. bye
[11:51:16] * taplar sings *don't goooooo.... please staaaaay*
[11:51:22] <duch_kazatel> hahha
[11:51:45] <taplar> if i got on my kneees.... and i pleaded with you....
[11:51:47] * taplar carries on
[11:52:04] <taplar> we need more duwap these days
[11:52:32] <duch_kazatel> *doo wap
[11:52:35] <duch_kazatel> and yes. we do.
[11:52:41] <duch_kazatel> and R&B and Soul.
[11:52:57] <MassDebates> I'll pass on the R&B
[11:53:07] <MassDebates> I've got plenty of soul already too
[11:53:14] <duch_kazatel> not to be confused with the stuff from the 90's and 00's
[11:53:15] <MassDebates> Totes for the doowap
[11:53:20] <MassDebates> ?
[11:53:33] <MassDebates> Can you share a couple youtube videos showing any stark differences? like two posterchilds?
[11:53:35] <MassDebates> (for compare)
[11:53:36] <taplar> R&B vs RnB heh
[11:53:39] <duch_kazatel> ^
[11:53:44] <MassDebates> I don't understand
[11:53:46] <MassDebates> n = &
[11:53:52] <MassDebates> Rock n Roll Rock & Roll
[11:54:04] <duch_kazatel> right, but traditional R&B is very different from modern stuff.
[11:54:10] <duch_kazatel> lemme look for an example.
[11:54:25] <MassDebates> non ha senso
[11:54:28] <MassDebates> hahahahaha
[11:54:58] <taplar> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iY2UpSz9Vs
[11:55:01] * taplar jams out
[11:55:08] <duch_kazatel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBn5aIfZElE
[11:55:29] <duch_kazatel> basically, oldschool rythm and blues was sort of a catch-all
[11:55:44] <MassDebates> Oooooh I like this
[11:55:45] <taplar> oh crap
[11:55:59] <taplar> some song is on the tip of my mind right now, lol, i hate that
[11:56:17] <duch_kazatel> but technically rock is a "fusion" genre - basically this along with country,.
[11:56:30] <MassDebates> So is this R&B or RnB?
[11:56:39] <duch_kazatel> traditional R&B
[11:56:45] <duch_kazatel> Rhythm and Blues
[11:57:21] <duch_kazatel> but the genre is HUGE.  the stones, the Who, stevie wonder, whitney houston...
[11:57:29] <duch_kazatel> lots of wiggle room in there.
[11:57:31] <MassDebates> Wait
[11:57:36] <MassDebates> Those aren't R*B
[11:57:45] <duch_kazatel> they are.
[11:57:51] <MassDebates> Americans call them Rock and Roll  no?
[11:57:53] <duch_kazatel> the stones were billed at rhythm and blues
[11:58:02] <duch_kazatel> reread prior statement about rock being a fusion genre ;)
[11:58:07] <MassDebates> Oh
[11:58:17] <taplar> trying to remember an R&B song, female singer.  think it started off with something, "Don't know much about...."
[11:58:35] <duch_kazatel> pretty much all western music descends from blues.   on its way we got jazz, country, rockabilly, bluegrass, etc.
[11:58:47] <duch_kazatel> taplar you mean sam cooke's wonderful world.
[11:58:51] <duch_kazatel> not a femal singer ;)
[11:58:53] <duch_kazatel> *female
[11:58:54] <taplar> bah
[11:59:17] <taplar> yeah!
[11:59:27] <taplar> maybe i heard a female cover
[11:59:40] <duch_kazatel> probanbly.
[11:59:45] <duch_kazatel> *probably. tons of people did it.
[12:01:01] <MassDebates> So are the Coasters R*B?
[12:01:18] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[12:01:24] <duch_kazatel> they are traditional R&B
[12:01:30] <MassDebates> Hm
[12:01:37] <MassDebates> Ink spots are R*B too
[12:01:41] <duch_kazatel> lol
[12:01:44] <MassDebates> hey! I'm getting pretty good at this!
[12:01:48] <duch_kazatel> you canstop using the asterisk ;)
[12:01:51] <MassDebates> Call me DJ MassDebates
[12:02:08] <MassDebates> brb, stuffing face
[12:02:23] <duch_kazatel> but yeah, r&b was a foundational genre,
[12:02:29] <MikeD_> var groupA = $( /* some A */); var groupB = $( /* some B */);  var both = groupA.add( groupB );  <-- doesn't work, how do I mash these two collections together?
[12:02:51] <duch_kazatel> should work just fine MikeD_
[12:03:16] <MikeD_> k, thanks
[12:03:27] <duch_kazatel> why don't you think it works?
[12:04:13] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jtnphmjp/
[12:04:16] <duch_kazatel> (shrug)
[12:23:19] <MikeD_> because I think I translated from the broken in someone else's app into the use-case that works, so i'm going to go make sure that's the situation
[12:43:27] <duch_kazatel> weeeeeee
[12:43:43] <taplar> my roommate has the day off.  i hate him
[12:43:55] <duch_kazatel> i almost took this week off.
[12:44:10] <taplar> i'm saving days for january in case we get ice
[12:44:34] <taplar> i can work from home, but some days i know i'll just be like fk it
[12:45:37] <duch_kazatel> hah, i hear that.
[13:03:54] <MikeD_> so yeah, the real solution was using groupA.add( groupB ) and expecting groupA to have been mutated
[13:04:16] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[13:04:23] <duch_kazatel> groupA doesn't change though.
[13:04:31] <MikeD_> that's why it didn't work
[13:04:44] <duch_kazatel> i'm way lost.
[13:04:55] <duch_kazatel> the code you shared didn't look like it was expecting that.
[13:05:28] <MikeD_> right, what I wrote as an example was valid/working... what I found in debugging was different from the working use-case
[13:05:36] <duch_kazatel> ah.
[13:05:36] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[13:05:46] <duch_kazatel> so say that example wasn't working so i was confused.
[13:06:23] <MikeD_> i should have done a closer inspection of the dude's code before assuming that ".add() didn't work" because ... well, because never trust a programmer :p
[13:06:28] <duch_kazatel> ah
[13:44:52] <MassDebates> duch_kazatel:  hey
[13:44:55] <MassDebates> I saw your fiddle
[13:45:03] <taplar2> woah
[13:45:28] <MassDebates> So you're setting a string to contain the class name of each of those elements
[13:45:36] <taplar> need to ask a man before you checkout his fiddle
[13:45:40] <duch_kazatel> wut
[13:45:42] <duch_kazatel> whichj fiddle?
[13:45:53] <MassDebates> with foo and bar
[13:45:57] <duch_kazatel> link?
[13:46:00] <MassDebates> $foo = $('.foo')
[13:46:03] <MassDebates> oh okay 2 scs
[13:46:09] <MassDebates> https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-VML#_Toc416858394
[13:46:14] <MassDebates> Shit wait
[13:46:17] <MassDebates> Fucking bookmark bar
[13:46:26] <MassDebates> CRAP i closed out github
[13:46:26] <MassDebates> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jtnphmjp/
[13:46:38] <MassDebates> Okay, so this thing
[13:46:45] <duch_kazatel> oh.
[13:46:46] <duch_kazatel> sup?
[13:46:53] <MassDebates> you're still using let for $bar just like foo right
[13:47:02] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:47:09] <MassDebates> let $foo = $('.foo'),
[13:47:16] <MassDebates> $bar = $('.bar'),
[13:47:20] <duch_kazatel> right?
[13:47:24] <duch_kazatel> both of those are using let?
[13:47:24] <MassDebates> you're still "letting" bar be bar
[13:47:28] <MassDebates> RIght, are they?
[13:47:32] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[13:47:39] <duch_kazatel> comma operator.
[13:47:52] <MassDebates> Oh sneaky beaky that's a comma
[13:47:53] <MassDebates> oh okay
[13:47:59] <taplar> heh
[13:48:02] <duch_kazatel> that's not sneaky.
[13:48:03] <duch_kazatel> heh
[13:48:06] <duch_kazatel> that's actually pretty standard.
[13:48:28] <MassDebates> I mean it looks like a semicolon (;)
[13:48:35] <duch_kazatel> it does?
[13:48:43] <MassDebates> at least 50% of it
[13:48:46] <MassDebates> lol
[13:48:52] <taplar> can't argue with that
[13:50:04] <duch_kazatel> heh
[15:21:41] <taplar> slooooow
[16:45:28] <starlays> hello to all, what other alternatives are available similar to blur or focusout event? The problem is that I'm creating an alert inside a blur/focusout event and the browser is entering in infinite-loop because it of the focus gaining and loosing between the popup window and the page
[16:45:42] <starlays> or, how can I fix this :(
[16:45:49] <duch_kazatel> don't use alert :)
[16:46:22] <duch_kazatel> use a modal instead.
[16:48:52] <starlays> duch_kazatel, a modal, like?
[16:49:54] <duch_kazatel> what do you mean?
[16:49:58] <duch_kazatel> pretty common UI element
[16:56:26] <starlays> duch_kazatel, it seems very complicated for a simple info text
[16:56:33] <duch_kazatel> it's really not.
[16:56:45] <duch_kazatel> and it's far friendlier than alert boxes.
[16:58:03] <starlays> you are referring at the modal from jquery UI?
[16:58:08] <duch_kazatel> any modal.
[16:58:24] <duch_kazatel> if you're not already using jqui, don't use it just for a modal.
[16:58:31] <taplar> you can write a basic modal with a small amount of html/css and optionally js
[16:58:54] <duch_kazatel> ^ or look for one of the dozens of libraries out there that'll do it.
[17:15:35] <starlays> Jquery UI works with jquery v 2.2.2?
[17:15:44] <duch_kazatel> should.
[17:15:59] <duch_kazatel> you aren't bringing in all of jqui jsut for modals, right?
[17:16:06] <duch_kazatel> *just
[17:17:19] <starlays> yes...
[17:17:24] <duch_kazatel> heh
[17:17:25] <duch_kazatel> that'
[17:17:29] <duch_kazatel> *that's kind of overkill.
[17:17:35] <starlays> I know
[17:17:56] <starlays> this is the reason why I have used alert and confirm
[17:18:10] <duch_kazatel> uh
[17:18:21] <duch_kazatel> you don't have to pull in all of jqui just to get modals duder.
[17:22:02] <starlays> I was looking for some modal jquery plugin and on the first look they are all blooated with bootstrap, I need one clean that supports info and confirmation
[17:22:09] <duch_kazatel> uh
[17:22:10] <duch_kazatel> heh
[17:22:30] <duch_kazatel> not all of them require bootstrap fwiw.
[17:22:45] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/kylefox/jquery-modal
[17:22:47] <duch_kazatel> boom.
[17:34:45] <starlays> duch_kazatel, thank you
[17:34:55] <duch_kazatel> #sure
[17:34:57] <starlays> i'will dig in tomorrow
[17:35:02] <duch_kazatel> alright.
[17:35:03] <starlays> night
[17:35:16] <duch_kazatel> good afternoon
[18:20:31] <Emperorpenguin> hello
[18:20:54] <duch_kazatel> goooooooood afternoon
[18:30:31] <Emperorpenguin> can anyone help with greasemonkey?
[18:30:36] <Emperorpenguin> I am trying to write something
[18:30:38] <duch_kazatel> we can try
[18:34:36] <Emperorpenguin> I am dealing with an interface written in jquery already. I need to add a button or at least modify a button when a specific section appears
[18:34:49] <Emperorpenguin> how can I run the script when a specific div appears?
[18:34:52] <duch_kazatel> nothing is written "in" jquery fwiw.
[18:34:56] <taplar> 'appears'?
[18:35:00] <duch_kazatel> and you can't really do that heh
[18:35:05] <Emperorpenguin> dammit
[18:35:34] <duch_kazatel> why do you want to do that?
[18:35:44] <duch_kazatel> and does the section get written to the page?
[18:35:48] <duch_kazatel> or does it just get shown?
[18:35:54] <Emperorpenguin> it gets written
[18:36:16] <duch_kazatel> so then let's ask this: how are you trying to modify the button?
[18:36:37] <Emperorpenguin> I want to change the onclick() function
[18:36:41] <duch_kazatel> heh
[18:36:53] <duch_kazatel> is it really inline on the element>?
[18:38:24] <duch_kazatel> ^^
[18:38:37] <Emperorpenguin> <button id="listaRigheOdT_btnEdit" onclick="listaRigheOdT_Edit()" type="button" style="..." class="..." role="button">...</button>
[18:38:40] <Emperorpenguin> yes
[18:39:05] <taplar> you might could do something with https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=DOM%2FMutationObserver
[18:39:07] <duch_kazatel> so let's experiment
[18:39:09] <Emperorpenguin> I mean I can change it by doing it manually on the terminal
[18:39:10] <duch_kazatel> eeeehh.
[18:39:11] <taplar> you'd have to observe a parent though
[18:39:18] <Emperorpenguin> yeah no problem
[18:39:19] <duch_kazatel> i'd avoid mutation observers here tbh.
[18:39:24] <duch_kazatel> i feel like there's a different way to do this.
[18:40:06] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/st7aLtp8/
[18:40:08] <duch_kazatel> so we have this
[18:40:36] <duch_kazatel> oh haha i can think of one way to do it.
[18:40:57] <taplar> i thought he said it was a dynamically created button?
[18:40:58] <duch_kazatel> hrm maybe not.
[18:41:24] <duch_kazatel> sure - that shouldn't matter if we focus on event emission.
[18:41:25] <Emperorpenguin> yes the whole parent div appears when I do a thing
[18:42:04] <duch_kazatel> right, don't care about when or how the element appears tbh.
[18:42:17] <duch_kazatel> i care about if we can do anything with event handlers to muck with it.
[18:43:20] <shoky> Emperorpenguin: when you do what thing
[18:43:37] <Emperorpenguin> click the "edit" button on the sceen before
[18:43:45] <shoky> there's your event, then..
[18:43:47] <duch_kazatel> ^
[18:43:49] <duch_kazatel> heh
[18:43:55] <taplar> ah, true
[18:43:59] <duch_kazatel> hell, overwrite the event handler for that sucker.
[18:44:12] <duch_kazatel> why do you care about the what the button does fwiw?
[18:44:39] <Emperorpenguin> I don't care what it does
[18:44:44] <Emperorpenguin> I want to change it anyway
[18:45:18] <duch_kazatel> then yeah, i'd modify the stuff that writes out the div to write out something else instead.
[23:51:47] <twg_> I have a multiselect dropdown box that I need to watch to see if a value is selected.  If it is, then I need to remove a class from a div.  I can remove the div with ease but I don't know how to watch for a value to be selected in a multi select dropdown
