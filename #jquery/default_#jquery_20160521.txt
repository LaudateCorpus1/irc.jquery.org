[00:35:26] <notchris-work> How do I loop through an array of objects, and log a key value of each object

[09:08:18] <_tank398_> Hi, is it possible to do something like this in jQuery?  It doesn't seem to work as is - https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a497b2c41a54dd37091f055085cb8ada
[09:12:19] <shoky_> _tank398_: it's possible yes, but if the DOM is not ready yet then it will probably not find your element
[09:13:15] <shoky_> just include your <script> at the end of <body> and you don't need to worry about doc.ready
[09:13:47] <_tank398_> ok, that makes sense.  I'm trying to tidy up my code and add some variables instead of selecting the same elements over and over.  Is there a recommended way of organising the code - should my docuemnt.ready appear before or after i declare some fucntions?
[09:14:25] <shoky_> uh i just gave a recommendation
[09:17:05] <_tank398_> shoky - sorry if i wasn't clearer.  This is my first jquery/ajax mini app and I'm not sure how my code should be organised.  It's messy and I'm trying to tidy it up by using variables but it is not behaving as I would expect.
[09:17:59] <shoky_> _tank398_: i recommended not using document.ready at all. just include your <script>s at the end of <body> tag and you can query for elements normally without a doc.ready
[09:18:58] <_tank398_> ah I see, thanks for clarifying.
[09:21:21] <JBreit> _tank398_, code paste?
[09:21:35] <JBreit> modular code works well
[09:21:44] <_tank398_> lol, it's awfully messy and I'm trying to tidy it up
[09:21:58] <_tank398_> it's one external JS file that I'm trying to get organised
[09:22:14] <JBreit> I typically use an IIFE instead of $(document).ready()
[09:22:21] <JBreit> use seperate files
[09:22:29] <_tank398_> and it has been hacked together as I am a total noob and this is my first AJAX project
[09:23:01] <JBreit> modules help with maintainability
[09:23:06] <JBreit> as well as scalability
[09:23:31] <JBreit> and if you use them correctly your code is decoupled instead of tightly coupled together
[09:23:44] <JBreit> that way if a module fails the entire application doesnt
[09:24:04] <_tank398_> JBreit - that makes sense of course, but maybe it's just a little beyond me at the moment
[09:24:18] <JBreit> http://www.adequatelygood.com/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-In-Depth.html
[09:24:24] <JBreit> good article on JS modules
[09:24:49] <_tank398_> great thanks, I'll take a good read of that
[09:24:54] <JBreit> it will also explain loosely coupled and tightly coupled code
[09:25:05] <JBreit> like I mentioned so you understand what I mean by that
[09:25:56] <JBreit> https://addyosmani.com/largescalejavascript/
[09:26:00] <JBreit> this is a good read as well
[09:26:28] <JBreit> i recommend reading this book as well https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/
[09:26:41] <JBreit> ^ free online html version
[09:26:59] <JBreit> will discuss more than just the module pattern :)
[09:27:19] <JBreit> should take you from newb to somewhat skilled if you grasp the paradigms
[09:28:43] <_tank398_> that's great thanks
[09:29:03] <JBreit> https://css-tricks.com/how-do-you-structure-javascript-the-module-pattern-edition/
[09:29:17] <JBreit> another article though I recommend the previous as you will definitely learn more
[09:30:06] <JBreit> also
[09:30:18] <JBreit> place your script tags at the bottom of your document page inside the body tags
[09:30:41] <JBreit> let the html & css load and once it hits the bottom well the document should pretty much be ready
[09:30:46] <JBreit> include a script via a tag
[09:30:59] <JBreit> and then create local scope with an anonymous function
[09:31:07] <JBreit> to keep your code from being global
[09:31:25] <JBreit> it will promote privacy
[09:31:31] <JBreit> also
[09:31:53] <JBreit> learning how to write an API is very useful
[09:32:11] <JBreit> especially if you are trying to write code that can be reused in future projects so you do not keep reinventing the wheel
[09:33:26] <JBreit> bbiab have to make the 2 year old eggs for breakfast
[09:33:35] <_tank398_> all noted.  I have some backend experience and have written a basic Web API in C# for the purpose of learning some frontend coding
[09:34:18] <_tank398_> I think I need to take it slow and solidify the jquery/ajax basics but I will do the reading and try to get a good grasp of the concepts
[09:34:44] <_tank398_> thanks for your time and links :)
[09:44:42] <JBreit> i learned more working in pure JavaScript than I did jQuery
[09:44:52] <JBreit> then when I came back to jQuery I was a lot better with things
[09:45:15] <JBreit> then again I also learned more JS writing JS for server-side using NodeJS
[09:45:27] <JBreit> removing the DOM so i could focus on the language itself
[09:45:38] <JBreit> kind of hard with jQuery though as it is all about the DOM
[09:45:46] <JBreit> the DOM is a pain
[09:45:55] <JBreit> ]takes a while to get used to manipulating & etc
[09:46:28] <JBreit> I just recently setup visual studio to write C# but haven't gotten that far yet
[09:49:06] <JBreit> I have been spending most of my time trying to figure out my own client-side router in JS/jQuery
[09:49:14] <JBreit> for when I write SPAs
[09:53:05] <_tank398_> I hear you.  I have a history in MS Access and SQL Server dev :O.  Quick, easy cash from SMEs :)  Trying to move on and expand my knowledge so I went Python to C#.  C# is a really nice language and I got to speed fairly quickly building backends
[09:54:32] <_tank398_> It's the frontend I'm having trouble getting up to speed with - nothing as easy as Access forms hehehee
[09:55:08] <_tank398_> now I'll go hang my head in shame because I mentioned MS Access
[10:01:00] <JBreit> hehe
[10:01:09] <JBreit> i remember Access from like a decade or so ago
[10:01:33] <JBreit> Ironically I am MS certified and hate using Windows for Development which is why I still haen't dove into C# yet
[10:04:06] <JBreit> keep in mind that JS prototypes have a lot of power when developing with JS/jQuery :)
[11:08:24] <z1haze2> I am trying to build my own slider and have it masked by an svg.. how would i got about keeping the slider image maintained within the mask even during resizing? my basic slider layout i have here: http://codepen.io/z1haze/pen/zqgOYb
[12:52:17] <z1haze2> does set interval run immediately or does it wait until to internval time to run the first time
[15:01:54] <berpcor> Hello. Explain to me one thing, please.
[15:03:05] <berpcor> https://jsfiddle.net/1mo6b7hg/
[15:03:22] <berpcor> .children() only travels a single level down the DOM tree while .find() can traverse down multiple levels
[15:03:46] <berpcor> But in my case .children() travels not a single level.
[15:04:00] <berpcor> Only the first level of li should become red.
[15:05:38] <berpcor> How is that possible that .children() travers down multiple levels?
[16:39:10] <shoky_> berpcor: because of css inheritance
[16:39:28] <shoky_> .children() is not traversing multiple levels,  the css is
[16:42:19] <berpcor> shoky_: Oh, indeed. Thank you )
[17:31:03] <Neobenedict_> anyone here who uses jquery validation
[17:31:28] <Neobenedict_> http://i.imgur.com/REK1XJs.png how can I move this "This field is required" validation over to under all the radio buttons
[17:32:12] <Neobenedict_> at the moment the label/span is being put under the first input.
[17:32:49] <Neobenedict_> nvm, google'd the answer
[17:32:54] <Neobenedict_> just needed the right wording
