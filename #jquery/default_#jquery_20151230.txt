[03:42:46] <PCatinean> Hey guys, i'm trying to make a box that I can drag images in overlap them
[03:42:58] <PCatinean> But I don't know how to do this with jquery ui dragable
[03:43:05] <PCatinean> I place 3 images in a container and each has a container of it's own
[03:43:16] <PCatinean> and I want to be able to overlap the images and move them around the same container
[04:14:22] <freeaks> hi there
[04:14:56] <freeaks> i'm trying to use datepicker, so i have this in my code:  $( "#datepicker_start" ).datepicker();
[04:15:11] <freeaks> it works well, but if i try to do that:  $( "#datepicker_start" ).datepicker("getDate", "10/12/2012");
[04:15:22] <freeaks> (according to the docs)
[04:15:30] <freeaks> then it doesn't work anymore
[04:16:46] <freeaks> i have no error in console, it just doesn't work, as in: datepicker does not popup anymore when i click in the input field, it does not select the date , it is just not here anymore
[04:16:55] <freeaks> someone would have and idea?
[04:17:26] <freeaks> here's the doc from where i've got that method 'setDate:
[04:17:27] <freeaks> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#method-setDate
[04:17:47] <freeaks> so this works:  $( "#datepicker_start" ).datepicker();
[04:17:58] <freeaks> this does not: $( "#datepicker_start" ).datepicker("getDate", "10/12/2012");
[04:18:05] <freeaks> set
[04:18:15] <freeaks> this does not: $( "#datepicker_start" ).datepicker("setDate", "10/12/2012");
[04:46:20] <hellyeah> one simple question?
[04:46:37] <hellyeah> learning kncokout.js for server side programming is a good choice?
[04:49:09] <hellyeah> wrong channel
[04:49:12] <hellyeah> sorry
[06:58:59] <VX> i on a site i want to display a link to a mobile app, for apple and android, is there a way to auto detect and present the correct link ?
[07:04:36] <Moonday> $('.my-class').html(
[07:04:36] <Moonday> "<p class=\"my-paragraph\">Hello World!</p>");  Can someone tell me if I'm using .html() incorrectly? Because the text and parapraph gets added to my index.html but the class for the parapgraph doesn't get added.
[07:12:54] <Uhkis> Moonday: use ' ' and no escapes
[07:14:21] <Moonday> thanks Uhkis :)
[07:14:24] <shoky> Moonday: that's fine, it works fine  https://jsfiddle.net/mran9g60/
[07:15:50] <Uhkis> that's not fine even though it works fine
[07:16:17] <shoky> yes, it is fine
[07:16:37] <Uhkis> you don't care about readability at all?
[07:16:50] <shoky> he's not asking about readability
[07:17:23] <shoky> if they cared about readability they wouldn't have html in their js code :)
[07:17:35] <Woet> shoky: if your text is containing to contain only/mainly double quotes, use single quotes. and vice versa.
[07:17:43] <Woet> is going to contain *
[07:17:49] <shoky> Woet: escaping quotes is fine
[07:18:02] <Woet> not if you dont have to
[07:18:03] <shoky> don't tell me what quotes to use :)
[07:18:17] <shoky> yes it's fine even if you don't have to. jesus
[07:18:28] <Woet> nope
[07:18:39] <shoky> ok.
[07:39:02] <dan_j> Hi. I'm trying to upgrade this line of code, but it's .browser has been removed. What can I use instead?
[07:39:03] <dan_j> if($.browser.msie && $.browser.version == '8.0')
[08:01:25] <P3nnyw1se> hi guys.. I use a datepicker with 'da'(danish) as my regional ..   it works when I'm running on localhost.. but a few minutes ago I copied my entire website (visual studio 2015)  into a IIS server, and now it seems like the regional is American or English... what could be the issue? I think I copied all files..
[08:10:32] <butdoesitburn> Hi there, is this a good idea on handling my issue? I'm to keep a treeview open, each tree item has her own unique href link. I'm to loop trough all href tags, see which one matches my current URL, grab the matched item, jump to the parent and add a class to it.
[08:11:53] <taplar> what have you tried so far?
[08:12:33] <butdoesitburn> Nothing, my brain can't think of any other way. Perhaps storing active page names in my session/cookie
[08:13:12] <butdoesitburn> Seeing that the href values match the url value, and the hrefs being unique, this must be the most simple way to handle this issue, right?
[08:14:27] <taplar> i don't see an issue with it.  unless like you said you had some other info you could match on.  that could be more efficient
[08:14:59] <ajm203> can you include "[href="+windows.location.href+"]" in your selector, then access .parent()?
[08:15:18] <taplar> possibly, but i wouldn't.  i would do that in a filter
[08:16:09] <P3nnyw1se> everytime I load my page, my input fields for datepickers are reset.. to English format, even though I picked another.. when I select a date it is no longer in English
[08:17:11] <taplar> weird, got a fiddle?
[08:21:03] <butdoesitburn> Taplar, what's the best way to grab the full current URL?
[08:21:39] <taplar> try window.location.href
[08:22:26] <butdoesitburn> beautiful, thank you
[08:23:57] <taplar> but like i said earlier, if you go that route, don't stick it in the selector.  use a filter() instead.  doing a selector with an attribute can result in a dom scan which can be slow.  it's better to do it in a filter after you have a smaller subset.
[08:27:07] <P3nnyw1se> jesus.. now I can't even add external ressources to a jsfiddle
[08:27:41] <taplar> external resources are still on the LHS.  for the jquery include it's the cog in the javascript textarea top right
[08:28:19] <P3nnyw1se> and regional ?
[08:28:34] <taplar> not sure what that is
[08:28:50] <P3nnyw1se> a script file, nevermind
[08:32:19] <P3nnyw1se> okay here is my problem.. I can't realy display more than half of it lol --> https://jsfiddle.net/rt6qn55d/
[08:32:53] <P3nnyw1se> as you can see the regional language of the datepicker is in Danish..
[08:33:33] <P3nnyw1se> but lets say I select a date, and hit the submit button.. then the page reloads (as they do) .. and the date I selected is presented in English
[08:33:39] <P3nnyw1se> I can repick.. and its back in danish
[08:33:44] <taplar> hmm
[08:34:09] <P3nnyw1se> its obviously the language setting
[08:34:15] <P3nnyw1se> on the server
[08:34:24] <P3nnyw1se> cause its in danish on localhost, but english on my english server
[08:34:30] <P3nnyw1se> I just don't know how to "force" it
[08:38:48] <P3nnyw1se> taplar this is what happens -> http://i65.tinypic.com/2mxl7vs.png
[08:39:39] <taplar> your saying the dashes vs the slashes?
[08:39:59] <P3nnyw1se> dd-mm-yyyy  to .. mm/dd/yyy
[08:40:05] <taplar> yeah
[08:40:26] <P3nnyw1se> okay so.. the datepicker has a regional setting to danish
[08:40:36] <P3nnyw1se> but the Html input element probably has it in English .. so when the page loads
[08:40:42] <P3nnyw1se> it shows in English.. does that sound about right ?
[08:40:45] <P3nnyw1se> cause thats what I'm thinking
[08:41:17] <taplar> not sure.  currently tinkering
[08:53:08] <taplar> so i got this: https://jsfiddle.net/rt6qn55d/2/
[08:53:23] <taplar> i changed the type="date" to type="text" as it was having an issue in the fiddle
[08:53:48] <taplar> so i have a question.  how are you populating the value for the datepicker after returning from the server?
[08:54:12] <taplar> is it like how i'm setting it on line 29?
[09:01:30] <PCatinean> how does one prevent a user from reszing a div more than the current values?
[09:01:35] <PCatinean> As in Jquery UI resizable
[09:01:39] <PCatinean> and no larger than the original values
[09:02:53] <taplar> you taken a look at the maximum / minimum size example?
[09:04:59] <PCatinean> taplar, yes I did, the thing is the resizable is cast on a div and inside it there's an image
[09:05:10] <PCatinean> since the div is display: inline-block it "hugs" the image
[09:05:15] <PCatinean> and I do not want it to get any larger than that
[09:05:57] <taplar> so you want to set the maxWidth and maxHeight to be the dimensions of the image?
[09:08:37] <PCatinean> taplar, yes exactly
[09:08:44] <PCatinean> the dimension of the image inside the div at startup
[09:08:45] <PCatinean> :D
[09:09:14] <taplar> in case P3nnyw1se comes back: https://jsfiddle.net/rt6qn55d/4/  <-- that might be what your after
[09:10:06] <taplar> PCatinean:so if you know the dimensions ahead of time you could get them right away.  otherwise you'd have to initialize or alter the resizable settings after the image loads
[09:10:42] <PCatinean> hmm, how do I do that?
[09:10:47] <PCatinean> after I mean
[09:10:57] <taplar> it would be a load event on the image i believe
[09:11:12] <taplar> and it looks like http://api.jqueryui.com/resizable/#method-option
[09:11:16] <taplar> would be how you would alter it
[09:17:15] <prestorium> is this the right channel for jqueryUI? I'm using jqueryUI datepicker and I set the input to required. When I load my form page (first load or refresh) the input field already has the red border indicating a required field. All other normal inputs are fine. Where should I look at? I have no clue as to where start.
[09:18:40] <taplar> how are you setting it to required?
[09:20:05] <taplar> sounds more like a jqueryvalidate issue
[09:25:08] <prestorium> taplar, <input ... required/>
[09:27:01] <prestorium> taplar, I'll look at jqueryvalidate. Thanks
[09:27:14] <taplar> that's more of a html tag
[09:27:20] <taplar> sorry, attribute
[09:27:44] <taplar> can you make a fiddle showing the issue?
[09:29:39] <taplar> also what browser are you using?
[09:31:04] <prestorium> taplar, I'm using firefox 43
[09:31:33] <prestorium> taplar, I'll try to provide a fiddle
[09:39:04] <holdmypocket> I'm having trouble checking an element for a class and removing it if it exists.. http://afc.zgncreative.com/local-resources/
[09:39:22] <holdmypocket> if you click on 'printer friendly version' it should uncollapse all of the business sections
[09:39:44] <holdmypocket> and then collapse them if you click it again. BUT if you have one uncollapsed, then click on it, it collapses the one that was open, but opens the rest
[09:39:53] <holdmypocket> my pastebin: http://pastebin.com/Cvhqfkud
[09:40:10] <_mouse_> yar!
[09:40:18] <taplar> holdmypocket:are you doing a toggle?
[09:40:27] <holdmypocket> I am using toggleClass
[09:40:33] <taplar> that's going to be your problem
[09:40:37] <_mouse_> where does jquery actually store the data when stored with .data()?
[09:40:54] <holdmypocket> so I should rethink my logic?
[09:41:14] <taplar> _mouse_:something internal, you'd have to look at the source
[09:41:26] <taplar> probably accessable some how with $._data
[09:41:49] <taplar> holdmypocket:you can't only use toggleClass as you've pointed out they could be mixed open and closed
[09:42:04] <taplar> you'll need a case for opening and a case for closing
[09:42:13] <arc_> are you sure he wasn't just asking about how it's written to a data attribute tag on the element
[09:42:16] <holdmypocket> taplar: gotcha, that makes sense. thanks!
[09:42:34] <taplar> arc_:i am not
[09:42:39] <arc_> ok :p
[09:42:48] <taplar> but iirc it doesn't work that way anway
[09:43:01] <arc_> it doesn't? i thought that was exactly how it worked
[09:43:12] <taplar> cause you can use data() to put any kinda of element on a dom node.  not just text which is what the data="" is
[09:43:29] <taplar> data() is similar to prop() in that aspect
[09:43:30] <arc_> i see
[09:48:38] <prestorium> taplar, I can't provide a fiddle, sorry :( But I'll keep digging it. Thank you
[09:49:11] <taplar> sure.  just from looking at it i think it's an issue with FF's handling of the required tag
[09:49:17] <taplar> i found some posts, hold on a sec
[09:49:28] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5939341/firefox-4-is-there-a-way-to-remove-the-red-border-in-a-required-form-input
[09:49:33] <taplar> maybe that will help some
[09:51:03] <prestorium> taplar, it should be firefox, you are right! I just tested on chrome and it worked fine. Thank you very much!
[09:51:11] <taplar> np
[09:51:21] <taplar> ff has good intentions, :)
[10:00:25] <taplar> holdmypocket:you could actually probably do something similar to the logic you have if you introduced a data elment
[10:00:28] <taplar> *element
[10:01:32] <holdmypocket> taplar: that would be a new concept to me. I'm not sure what you mean, is there some suggested reading?
[10:01:41] <taplar> one second
[10:05:00] <taplar> ah, you were using the hasClass for what i was thinking of for a data element
[10:05:34] <taplar> i was thinking something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/ej6vhee0/
[10:07:15] <taplar> the adding/removing/checking the class on the clickable would work too though
[10:12:51] <holdmypocket> ahh I see
[10:14:49] <holdmypocket> taplar: thank you so much for your help, that worked perfectly
[10:14:55] <taplar> cool
[10:15:18] <holdmypocket> I have trouble understanding the difference between when I'm in JS and jquery
[10:15:22] <holdmypocket> it looks to me like your solution is all js
[10:15:33] <taplar> most of it is jquery
[10:15:40] <holdmypocket> i'll read up on .data
[10:16:06] <taplar> data() is used to access data-*="" attributes on a dom element
[10:16:23] <taplar> data('key') getter, data('key', 'value') setter
[10:16:48] <holdmypocket> okay
[10:16:53] <taplar> one key difference being that data-*="" attributes are string values only, but jquery data() lets you do any kind of value
[10:17:21] <taplar> which is why you are able to use boolean true/false as you are
[10:18:58] <taplar> just remember, jquery is js, :P
[10:19:23] <holdmypocket> and jquery is just a library to extend js
[10:19:38] <taplar> yup
[12:06:56] <Videbligo> hi
[12:07:09] <taplar> hello
[12:07:22] <Videbligo> can i get some help here on some code I am writing?
[12:07:33] <taplar> depends on what you mean by 'help'
[12:07:41] <Videbligo> yes, understand. :-)
[12:07:44] <taplar> we can offer advice, :)  we don't write solutions though
[12:07:47] <Videbligo> has to do with promises and deferred
[12:07:55] <Videbligo> angular and factories
[12:08:25] <taplar> what's your question?  (not proficient with angular, btw)
[12:08:52] <Videbligo> so here's what I'm trying to do: setup an angular factory that relies on client and id.
[12:09:08] <Videbligo> inject the factory into the module
[12:09:24] <Videbligo> and offer APIs such as "getProfile()"
[12:10:10] <Videbligo> problem is I can't get the response without going through all sorts of promise processing. I just want something simple like $scope.profile = getProfile();
[12:10:26] <Videbligo> does this make sense?
[12:11:21] <taplar> from my quick and dirty searching it looks like with a factory (or service) it would look more like $scope.profile = myFactory.getProfile()
[12:12:07] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14324451/angular-service-vs-angular-factory is what i'm referencing currently
[12:12:08] <Videbligo> yes, that would be the exact syntax.
[12:13:16] <Videbligo> but right now I have to do $scope.profile = profileService.getProfile() = function() ... .then ...process promise... and then the profile is stuck in the closure.
[12:13:44] <Videbligo> this is a gosh darn javascript closure issue.
[12:14:48] <Videbligo> ultimately I'd like profileService.getProfile to return an object instead of a promise, but I can't figure out getProfile() to do this.
[12:15:30] <taplar> ok, so getProfile is returning a promise, of which when it is done you want the returned object to be set in $scope.profile
[12:15:43] <Videbligo> correct.
[12:16:12] <Videbligo> and I think I'm better off moving the promise processing into the factory rather than in the controller.
[12:16:14] <taplar> so that would be something like profileService.getProfile().done(function(result){ $scope.profile = result; });
[12:16:33] <PCatinean> I'm back with the resizable problm
[12:16:52] <Videbligo> let me try that.
[12:16:53] <PCatinean> taplar, I should iterate through all elements that have resize and set the min-height max-height after?
[12:17:13] <PCatinean> If the $(selector).resizable is inside document.ready
[12:17:32] <taplar> PCatinean:if you added an event handler on load for the elements, then that handler would/could do it once they are each loaded
[12:17:56] <PCatinean> then how do I get the image for each since there are multiple elements
[12:18:00] <PCatinean> the selector is by class
[12:18:22] <taplar> you'd be binding on the image element.  in the handler it would be accessable with 'this' contextually
[12:20:20] <taplar> heh, i'm thinking i may need to add a context note section to my jquery cheatsheet
[12:21:25] <PCatinean> hmm not sure where I can access this
[12:21:35] <PCatinean> I would have to have a function somewhere
[12:21:38] <PCatinean> maybe in stop
[12:23:10] <taplar> $(selectorForImagesSurroundedByResizable).on('load', function(){ /* do stuff with 'this' which will be each individually loaded image tag */ });
[12:24:57] <PCatinean> I add the resizable and draggable later?
[12:25:02] <PCatinean> or inside the function call
[12:25:33] <taplar> it would be cleanest to initialize inside that done().  but if you initialized before, the modify could happen in that done()
[12:26:12] <PCatinean>     $( ".cfg_image" ).on('load', function(){        debugger;      })
[12:26:16] <PCatinean> does not trigger apparently
[12:26:31] <taplar> how fast are these images loading?  may already be loaded so it's not firing
[12:26:50] <PCatinean> not sure but that can vary a lot
[12:27:00] <taplar> and the cfg_image class is directly on the img tag?
[12:28:32] <PCatinean> taplar, actually it's on a div surrounding the image, because if I place it on the image itself then resizable does not work in conjucation with dragable
[12:28:43] <taplar> you need to select the image itself
[12:28:51] <taplar> iirc, load event does not bubble
[12:29:02] <PCatinean> I understand, kinda makes sense now that you mention it
[12:29:06] <PCatinean> a div does not "load"
[12:29:44] <taplar> i'm going to make a quick food run, brb
[12:29:51] <PCatinean> enjoy your meal!
[12:30:02] * PCatinean is chewing on peanuts
[12:30:26] <Maxpen> Hey can someone help me fix my internet connection script? the only issue is that it doesn't display the offline txt when you are offline
[12:30:27] <Maxpen> https://jsfiddle.net/7cdv9gwz/
[12:36:45] <PCatinean> taplar, still not firing after being placed on image
[12:37:04] <PCatinean> and $('.config_img img') returns all the images
[12:37:20] <Videbligo> ok, I've simplified this problem by getting rid of the promise. profileService depends on client and id so it does not appear to need a promise.
[12:38:18] <Videbligo> so when I execute $scope.profile = profileService.getProfile();, i can console.log(response) in getProfile() and I see the result is accurate.
[12:38:35] <Videbligo> but when i console.log($scope.profile), i get undefined.
[12:39:00] <Videbligo> so this is a loading and timing issue, but where to do create the dependency?
[12:40:02] <Videbligo> profileCtrl does require profileService to be injected as a dependency
[12:44:19] <ngharo> Maxpen: https://jsfiddle.net/7cdv9gwz/1/
[12:46:13] <Maxpen> awesome! @ngharo will try it out right now on my work board
[12:49:24] <Videbligo> hi
[12:50:56] <Videbligo> any help on dependencies of code execution?
[12:51:22] <robertmaxrees> Videbligo if you have any questions, just ask.
[12:51:25] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will.
[12:52:00] <Videbligo> thanks
[12:52:21] <Maxpen_> It works ngharo!
[12:52:25] <Maxpen_> thank you so much
[12:52:29] <Maxpen_> my script was shit I know
[12:52:37] <ngharo> :)
[12:58:56] <Maxpen> ngharo here is the final version; https://jsfiddle.net/7cdv9gwz/2/
[12:59:42] <Maxpen> I know it has some clutter here and there
[13:00:30] <HowardwLo> has anyone run into problems doing .ajax on mobile safari?
[13:01:09] <HowardwLo> my ajax works on pc’s but seems to not happen on mobile
[13:01:13] <ngharo> Maxpen: you ought to put the <div id="onlinestate"> ... into the markup instead of appending it via jquery
[13:01:42] <HowardwLo> this is my ajax, nothing special https://dpaste.de/K9EY
[13:02:16] <HowardwLo> it just tracks to see if anyone abandoned the checkout process after typing in their email and such
[13:02:17] <ngharo> then instead of <strongs> you can just style the #onlinestate div with font-weight: bold, and use .text() instead of .html()
[13:02:27] <ngharo> Maxpen: but in any case, you're fine just some tips that I would do
[13:02:31] <Maxpen> ah I see
[13:02:40] <Maxpen> why?
[13:02:41] <Maxpen> this is perfomance wise?
[13:03:10] <ngharo> yeah and .text() is safer ... doesn't matter in this case but it's a habit worth forming
[13:04:44] <HowardwLo> i’ve tried the SO suggestion that i use relative URL’s instead of full URL’s in by ajax calls, but no dice
[13:05:06] <HowardwLo> otherwise it’s this: https://dpaste.de/H3Jm
[13:05:10] <Maxpen> alright I'll do it
[13:05:45] <taplar> HowardwLo:what's the error?
[13:05:56] <Maxpen> https://jsfiddle.net/7cdv9gwz/3/ final version I guess ngharo
[13:06:11] <Maxpen> the reason why I append is so I don't have to add more junk to the template
[13:06:12] <HowardwLo> taplar: im not sure how to check the error, but so far as i know, it’s not throwing any
[13:06:17] <Maxpen> I prefer to keep it as vanilla as possible
[13:06:21] <Maxpen> I'm making a phpbb style
[13:06:26] <HowardwLo> taplar: desktop is all clear, not too sure how to hceck mobile error
[13:06:32] <Maxpen> easier for updating when new version comes out
[13:06:42] <ngharo> Maxpen: ohh gotcha
[13:07:15] <taplar> well crud
[13:08:55] <Maxpen> not sure if I'm allowed to name the url?
[13:08:56] <taplar> do you have access to the backend?  can you log or see any logs of incoming requests?
[13:10:03] <Maxpen> btw anyone here ever heard of eager?
[13:10:30] <taplar> the beaver
[13:10:35] <HowardwLo> taplar: i do have access, i’ll turn on logging and try stuff again
[13:12:29] <Maxpen> for those of you who like making js apps and all that its really worth checking out
[13:13:45] <ngharo> Looks like the point of that project is so you don't have to make anything :)
[13:15:44] <taplar> heh, what is this.  the app store for websites now
[13:24:24] <sportman> id love to know a little more about jquery.off and whether or not i can unbined multiple events at once?
[13:24:37] <robertmaxrees> *handlers.
[13:24:38] <robertmaxrees> not events.
[13:24:42] <sportman> yes
[13:24:43] <robertmaxrees> and the docs explain it pretty clearly.
[13:25:11] <robertmaxrees> "Calling .off() with no arguments removes all handlers attached to the elements. Specific event handlers can be removed on elements by providing combinations of event names, namespaces, selectors, or handler function names."
[13:36:06] <sportman> robertmaxrees: i think i realized my problem
[13:36:11] <sportman> i had multiple click events on the same element
[13:36:14] <sportman> i shoudl consolidate them
[13:36:44] <sportman> also i should drink another cup of coffee
[13:50:58] <ngharo> coffee++
[13:54:22] <ccmonster> i have two tabs, with a list on each tab. i am trying to split a list up into equal groupings. Trick is, each list has items that are not visible. Furthermore, when I try to find the subset of the list using :visible, this breaks on the tab that isn't currently showing because none of them are :visible.
[13:54:54] <robertmaxrees> so what, exactly, are you trying to accomplish?
[13:55:06] <robertmaxrees> do you want to divide up all visible items?
[13:55:12] <ccmonster> yes.
[13:55:36] <ccmonster> $listItems = $elem.find('li'), $listItemsVisible = $listItems.filter('li:visible')
[13:56:13] <ccmonster> this gives me an empty set when it's filtering the list on the tab which is not active.
[13:56:15] <robertmaxrees> what is visibility controlled by?  just whether or not they're in the visible tab?
[13:56:25] <robertmaxrees> having a hard time building a mental model here.
[13:56:25] <ccmonster> I believe so.
[13:56:36] <robertmaxrees> so then why filter using visible?
[13:56:52] <ccmonster> Well, I'm trying to bug fix something, so ... that's a great question haha
[13:57:12] <robertmaxrees> if you want to split them all up, that filter sounds entirely unnecessary,.
[13:57:13] <ccmonster> I'm just here to clean up the mess. wasn't sure if there was another way to go about it I was unaware of.
[13:57:34] <robertmaxrees> sure - render it right to start with.
[13:58:26] <ccmonster> Well, it's just rendering a list on a tab that when the operation occurs cue'd by some event, one of the lists technically aren't visible.
[13:59:08] <ccmonster> so if tab a is active, and this event occurs, some of the items in the list on the current tab are technically not :visible.
[13:59:36] <ccmonster> this is why it attempts to filter visible items.
[13:59:44] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're using visibile to demarcate status.
[13:59:46] <robertmaxrees> which is bad.
[13:59:49] <ccmonster> however, it shoots itself in the foot regarding the items in the non-active tab.
[14:00:37] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways to handle this - the "best" way would be to do some client-side templating and use a status bit of some kind on all those entries and render out as necessary.
[14:00:49] <yinkum> I'm trying to put a listener on the URL for recognizing Angular page changes - is this something I could utilize on/bind for or would I have to find some way to get hashchange to work?
[14:00:59] <ccmonster> yea. I'm surprised there isn't a use of a class
[14:01:03] <ccmonster> or attr of some sort
[14:01:11] <robertmaxrees> yinkum use angular to handle that.
[14:01:22] <robertmaxrees> ccmonster otherwise, refactor to give hidden or displayed a special class and go from there.
[14:01:27] <ccmonster> sounds like you want a 'router' of some sort yinkum
[14:01:40] <ccmonster> yea. i feared that was the only approach. Thanks
[14:01:51] <ccmonster> appreciate the consult sir, robertmaxrees
[14:01:54] <robertmaxrees> ccmonster that's not the ONLY approach, but probably your best bet for now.
[14:02:02] <yinkum> robertmaxrees I'm trying to lay something over the page (like with Google Tag Manger or the like)
[14:02:19] <robertmaxrees> yinkum angular's router should handle that for you.
[14:02:21] <robertmaxrees> or whatever it has.
[14:02:29] <yinkum> i'll take a look - thanks!
[14:02:33] <robertmaxrees> like... jquery doesn't handle any of that for you.
[14:04:08] <ccmonster> yea, you want a router. SPA is better done as a cohesive approach. So use a backbone/angular or something where it's more integrated, IMO
[14:04:14] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:04:20] <robertmaxrees> if you're buying into the platform, but into it.
[14:04:33] <robertmaxrees> unless you're using a tag manager, then it should have something for you to handle that.
[14:04:50] <ccmonster> yea, maybe he could bolt something on, but not sure really what he wants.
[14:05:06] <ccmonster> use the right tool for the right job.
[14:05:14] <robertmaxrees> unless you're using a tag manager ;)
[14:05:21] <ccmonster> ha!
[14:05:23] <robertmaxrees> like everybody using omniture will basically have to.
[14:05:41] <ccmonster> ugh. urls and tracking.
[14:05:46] * ccmonster walks off cliff
[14:06:01] <robertmaxrees> omniture gets some stuff right, but the API is terrible.
[14:06:04] <drej`w> robertmaxrees: sadface
[14:07:23] <ccmonster> omniture is a unwieldy beast
[14:07:34] <yinkum> that's a good way to put it
[14:08:05] <ccmonster> and if there's money tied to what you're doing (omniture clearly ...) then they will shoe-horn the product to do any and everything, by hook or crook, damn the consequences.
[14:08:46] <robertmaxrees> one of my first big projects was to write an of api facade of sorts for omniture.
[14:08:48] <ccmonster> it usually muddies the waters where it's relied upon.
[14:08:50] <robertmaxrees> worked pretty ok surprisingly.
[14:08:54] <ccmonster> really? nice.
[14:31:47] <jerjerjer> hi guys, i'm trying to trigger radio buttons while click on a list item - i can't seem to get it to work... Any suggestions? https://jsfiddle.net/87qvtetm/
[14:40:49] <robertmaxrees> so .closest() goes UP the tree to parent elements.
[14:41:34] <robertmaxrees> so when you click on an element, you're saying "go to the parent radio box inside a form", which doesn't exist.
[14:41:55] <jerjerjer> ahh sounds logical
[14:42:10] <robertmaxrees> you need to tie the two together.
[14:42:41] <robertmaxrees> also, you're missing a name attribute on those radios to tie them together.
[14:44:24] <jerjerjer> i see - but how would you tie them together?
[14:44:35] <robertmaxrees> the inputs with the radios?
[14:45:44] <jerjerjer> well, i'll add the name attributes so it ties together like you said - i forgot to add that in the fiddle example
[14:46:21] <jerjerjer> but still, how do i find the matched element traversing the dom tree? or don't i have to traverse the dom tree?
[14:46:22] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use JS at all for this.
[14:46:23] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/87qvtetm/1/
[14:48:02] <jerjerjer> haha yea - thats another way to do it... damn - sometimes you think outside the box while you dont even have to
[14:52:10] <robertmaxrees> just gotta know what tools you've got.
[15:00:16] <Safinn> How can I do something like this: $(selector).children()[i].html('hi')
[15:00:46] <Safinn> I want to select a specific child while looping through a different array.
[15:01:01] <taplar> .eq() instead of []
[15:01:25] <Safinn> ahh taplar. Sounds good. let me try.
[15:02:44] <Safinn> @taplar perfect. Thanks!
[15:03:36] <taplar> [] breaks out of the jQuery wrapper.  eq() keeps the wrapper
[15:24:17] <Videbligo> Hi, I'm back. Here is the fiddle for my problem.
[15:24:19] <Videbligo> http://jsfiddle.net/vchokshi/2ttjbfc4/16/
[15:24:49] <Videbligo> my problem is when I switch from a static profile.firstname to calling the client, I get an undefined in my controller.
[15:37:14] <robertmaxrees> Videbligo you need to ask in #angular or whatever channel is related to angular.
[15:37:40] <Videbligo> thanks robert, this just seemed like a javascript loading issue, less angular.
[15:37:58] <robertmaxrees> Videbligo then ask in ##javascript ;) there's no jquery use in there :)(
[15:38:29] <Videbligo> haha ok. new to IRC..
[15:38:58] <ExtraSteve> huh, why is it that when I do $('select').on('change',myFunction()); it fires as soon as the page loads? But if I remove the () on myFunction it doesn't?
[15:39:12] <ExtraSteve> Is it because the () prevents the function from being passed as a first class citizen?
[15:39:14] <robertmaxrees> because it wants a reference to the function.
[15:39:20] <robertmaxrees> the () runs it immediately.
[15:39:24] <ExtraSteve> Makes sense
[15:39:29] <robertmaxrees> which then assigns the return of that function as the handler.
[15:39:48] <robertmaxrees> it's not about "being passed as a first class citizen" - functions always ARE first class citizens.
[15:40:25] <ExtraSteve> I figured that if anything it'd return the return value of the myFunction() call when 'change' occured - not just when the page loads
[15:40:28] <ExtraSteve> Which kinda confused me
[15:40:42] <ExtraSteve> But I suppose that makes sense - it wants to eval it on the page load
[15:40:42] <robertmaxrees> doing myFunction() is the same as doing $('select').on('change', function(){}());
[15:40:56] <robertmaxrees> it's not about what *it* wants to do, that's how the language works.
[15:41:14] <ExtraSteve> Makes sense
[15:42:24] <ExtraSteve> js and jquery have been a blast to learn
[15:42:29] <ExtraSteve> And I'm always learning something new
[15:42:36] <robertmaxrees> :) and you always will.
[15:42:37] <ExtraSteve> Thanks :)
[15:42:46] <robertmaxrees> once you get the fundamentals down you'll get into the really fun stuff.
[16:45:01] <HowardwLo> ok so i’ve narrowed down my problem. My ajax is indeed not hitting my server on mobile phones
[17:17:03] <ajf-> anyone knows a jquery/jqueryUI solution for the typical "toggleClass('active')" case ?
[17:17:17] <ajf-> except it gives you some extra tooling and consistency, e.g. is(':active') and such
[17:17:34] <ajf-> i'm surprised UI-core does not have anything like that ?
[17:19:52] <ajf-> example: for when you want a button that opens a modal/dropdown/dialog, and you set the button to ".active" if it is open
[17:24:36] <robertmaxrees> that's what toggleClass does.
[17:24:46] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you're looking for otherwise.
[17:40:58] <z1haze> please help me :( I cannot for the last 2 hours figure out how to make a simple import of jquery to my page using browserify
[17:42:11] <z1haze> from my js file i have var jQuery = require('jQuery'); and when i compile it looks like this: https://gist.github.com/z1haze/798b5e805b738ca9ce97, and after that i try a jQuery(document).ready(function ($) { ... and it tells me jQuery is undefined.. how is it possible
[17:43:31] <robertmaxrees> require('jquery');
[17:43:33] <robertmaxrees> lowercase.
[17:43:42] <robertmaxrees> see if that works.
[17:43:47] <robertmaxrees> if not, share the file.
[17:44:08] <z1haze> i did share the file.
[17:44:26] <robertmaxrees> no, you shared the output.
[17:44:29] <robertmaxrees> i want the input
[17:44:44] <z1haze> i shared that too.
[17:44:52] <robertmaxrees> i don't see it.
[17:44:56] <z1haze> require('jquery'); is the only thing in the file.
[17:45:14] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[17:45:48] <z1haze> that sucks
[17:46:04] <robertmaxrees> why are you being secretive about the file?
[17:46:14] <z1haze> .. im not.
[17:46:19] <robertmaxrees> then share it?
[17:46:38] <robertmaxrees> "i'm not sure what i'm doing wrong, but i'm sure my file is right"
[17:46:44] <z1haze> you're not listening.
[17:46:55] <z1haze> but since you dont believe me. http://puu.sh/me9vx/a32bb85960.png
[17:46:56] <robertmaxrees> i am, actually - you're sharing a single line and claiming that's it.
[17:47:01] <z1haze> that IS it
[17:47:08] <ajf-> so in the docs of event.namespace (https://api.jquery.com/event.namespace/) the example reads that you should attach a normal click handler to the element and then manually trigger the namespaced event, like this: $(el).on('click', function() { $( this ).trigger('click.mynamespace'); });. Can't I do it directly, like this: $(el).on('click.mynamespace', function(e) {}) ?
[17:48:07] <robertmaxrees> z1haze what if you try var $ = require('jquery')(window); ?
[17:48:47] <robertmaxrees> ajf- per the docs "One or more space-separated event types and optional namespaces, such as "click" or "keydown.myPlugin"."
[17:50:00] <ajf-> robertmaxrees: doing this: $(el).on('click.customnamespace', function(e) { alert(e.namespace); }); alerts "undefined"
[17:50:13] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle?
[17:51:10] <robertmaxrees> ajf- because https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bxLqetdu/
[17:51:56] <ajf-> seems like jsfiddle doesn't allow alerts or something ?
[17:52:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:52:13] <ajf-> i'm not getting anything out of yours
[17:52:14] <ajf-> are you ?
[17:52:16] <robertmaxrees> i used a console log because alerts are annoying.
[17:52:20] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[17:52:37] <arc_> alert just means you have to press OK every time you test something
[17:52:42] <arc_> no thx
[17:52:45] <robertmaxrees> it also halts execution.
[17:52:50] <arc_> that too
[17:53:26] <robertmaxrees> console.log() exists partially BECAUSE people used to use alert() and got annoyed with it.
[17:53:29] <ajf-> ok what I mean is this: https://jsfiddle.net/zefadb9f/1/
[17:53:43] <robertmaxrees> that's a plain click event.
[17:53:51] <ajf-> so every namespaced event must be triggered with .trigger
[17:54:29] <ajf-> so ... element on 'click' => trigger 'click.mynamespace', then element on 'click.mynamespace' => do something
[17:54:57] <ajf-> why not just $(el).on('click.namespace', function(e) { // something }); ?
[17:55:08] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating what namespaces are for.
[17:55:31] <ajf-> i need a namespace so later I can call $(el).off(...)
[17:55:36] <ajf-> just that
[17:55:56] <robertmaxrees> 2 things - 1. why are you removing the handler? and 2. then none of this requires that you look at the namespace in the handler.
[17:56:25] <ajf-> because I'm doing some dropdown/modal/etc.that need to be closed when you click somewhere else in the page
[17:56:33] <ajf-> and i'm achieving that by adding a namespaced handler to document
[17:56:36] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't require unbinding anything.
[17:56:39] <ajf-> and then stopping propagation on the actual element
[17:56:52] <robertmaxrees> just check if it's open and, if so, hide it.
[17:56:56] <robertmaxrees> instead of juggling listener.s
[17:57:12] <robertmaxrees> z1haze did that work?
[17:57:35] <z1haze> well, i dont know
[17:57:42] <z1haze> i dont think so
[17:57:57] <ajf-> alright so to answer my question, namespaces are not valid if specified directly on the .on() function ?
[17:58:01] <robertmaxrees> z1haze huh?
[17:58:02] <ajf-> just when using .trigger() ?
[17:58:28] <robertmaxrees> ajf- errr, they're still "valid", but your scenario won't work.
[17:58:53] <z1haze> no robertmaxrees it did not work
[17:59:01] <robertmaxrees> z1haze var $ = require('jquery')(window); -  didn't work?  hrm...
[17:59:34] <z1haze> yea im getting Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[17:59:50] <robertmaxrees> any other console errors?
[17:59:51] <z1haze> here: })(jQuery);
[18:00:07] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[18:00:13] <robertmaxrees> i might check in a browserify channel then?
[18:00:23] <z1haze> ok
[18:05:08] <ajf-> robertmaxrees how else can I solve this problem ? https://jsfiddle.net/zefadb9f/3/
[18:06:58] <ajf-> seemed pretty straightforward until I realised that namespaces on .on() are not considered
[18:07:18] <robertmaxrees> they are considered, but not in the way you want them to be.
[18:08:13] <ajf-> so just use triggers then and juggle events all over the place ?
[18:08:20] <robertmaxrees> uh
[18:08:26] <robertmaxrees> don't juggle at all.
[18:08:26] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[18:09:51] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zefadb9f/4/
[18:10:42] <ajf-> ah .. well..
[18:10:50] <ajf-> apart from that .show() should probably be .toggle()
[18:10:59] <ajf-> that looks simpler
[18:11:25] <ajf-> thanks
[18:11:36] <robertmaxrees> why the toggle?
[18:11:49] <robertmaxrees> (i'm opt for the solution you had before but with classes fwiw)
[18:12:46] <ajf-> because now clicking the button doesn't close it
[18:13:07] <robertmaxrees> there's actually a hacky fix for that hahaha
[18:13:10] <ajf-> ah no that's just the stoppropagation
[18:13:17] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm.
[18:13:33] <robertmaxrees> yeah, do the setup you had before but rely on classes.
[18:13:49] <ajf-> wait but
[18:14:15] <ajf-> then I'll attach a new click handler on document on every show ? how do I use .off() ?
[18:14:23] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[18:14:25] <robertmaxrees> what?
[18:14:34] <robertmaxrees> this only binds a listener once.
[18:14:44] <robertmaxrees> i'm talking just about the toggle.
[18:14:59] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, no one is replying there man
[18:15:17] <robertmaxrees> z1haze dunno what to tell you then :)
[18:15:26] <z1haze> dang
[18:19:25] <z1haze> Im been able to use browserify to import jquery and jquery UI, but when i concat another script to my file, i get js errors, can anyone please help me ? If i remove the third script from the compilation and just add it separate, the errors go away.. but what could cause them?
[18:20:17] <duch_kazatel> what's the third script?
[18:22:34] <z1haze> its a camera slider plugin duch_kazatel
[18:22:43] <z1haze> http://www.pixedelic.com/plugins/camera/
[18:22:57] <z1haze> it works if i load the scripts individually, but i want to load all my vendor stuff in a single file
[18:23:12] <duch_kazatel> so what's the error that you're getting?
[18:23:47] <z1haze> just says uncause regerence error marginLeft is undefined
[18:23:56] <z1haze> at some random place in the code
[18:25:13] <duch_kazatel> dunno then.  i'd have to see it.
[18:48:43] <SmashingX> I have this code in jsfiddle, this code suppose to check for invalid numbers like -12-12, the first time I type that it removes the number (which is good) the second time it doesn't call my function, can somebody help me?
[18:49:05] <duch_kazatel> post the fiddle.  if somebody can help, they will.
[18:50:00] <SmashingX> https://jsfiddle.net/8vvkvxef/
[18:50:09] <SmashingX> I forgot to paste it sorry lol
[18:51:10] <duch_kazatel> so how do I trigger the bug?
[18:52:05] <SmashingX> type -1231-12 in amount and it should be erased
[18:52:14] <SmashingX> type the same again and it doesn't get erased
[18:52:28] <SmashingX> I don't know why the second time is not being called
[18:52:46] <SmashingX> I mean sorry after you type that number you have to click somewhere else in order for it to change it
[18:52:50] <duch_kazatel> it's not erasing at all for mne.
[18:53:24] <SmashingX> then type a correct number
[18:53:26] <SmashingX> like 12
[18:53:31] <SmashingX> and then try it again
[18:53:47] <duch_kazatel> that broke.
[18:53:51] <SmashingX> ?
[18:54:02] <duch_kazatel> that triggered the bug.
[18:54:08] <SmashingX> oh i x
[18:54:09] <SmashingX> i c
