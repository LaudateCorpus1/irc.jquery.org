[04:40:31] <Paladine> I fixed it sorry should have updated in here
[04:40:54] <Whiskey> How can you download text from an external website? lets say any page, but only the text and not whole content, found a way to get whole content :)
[04:41:16] <Paladine> use regular expressions to remove all the tags
[04:41:25] <seutje> like .wrap > div { display: none; } .wrap > div:first-child { display: block; } .wrap:hover > div { display: block; } .wrap:hover > div.first-child { display: none; }
[04:41:35] <seutje> Paladine: ew
[04:42:23] <Paladine> seutje, that was in response to Whiskey
[04:42:28] <seutje> oh
[04:42:40] <seutje> he has some of the most fucked up requirements
[04:42:51] <Whiskey> Paladine: thats the only way?
[04:42:55] <Paladine> sounds like he is trying to scrape other web sites
[04:43:07] <Whiskey> seutje: i thinked as i allredy have the text, i donÂ´t have to add it one again, but yeh its more simple
[04:43:14] <seutje> Whiskey: could of course use proper CORS mechanics
[04:43:19] <Paladine> Whiskey, yes because the web server always sends an html document which includes tags
[04:43:36] <Paladine> so you have to manually remove the tags
[04:43:38] <seutje> but then u'd still grab the whole page and parse it
[04:43:57] <Paladine> removing the tags is relatively straight forward with regex
[04:44:02] <seutje> Whiskey: what's ur goal anyway?
[04:44:03] <seutje> lol
[04:44:08] <seutje> "relatively"
[04:44:09] <Whiskey> Paladine: does it get the head also?
[04:44:16] <seutje> until you see how liberal HTML really is :P
[04:44:20] <Whiskey> for now or for the wohle pic?
[04:44:32] <seutje> the grand scheme of things
[04:44:44] <Whiskey> well im pretty happy whit what i got actully
[04:45:14] <Whiskey> something i have to do is cleanup as everything looks as shit atm but works fine :)
[04:45:59] <Whiskey> suck at regexp lets see if we can do this
[04:46:55] <Paladine> yeah I have some major code clean up to do on my site - my css files have so many repeated classes from trying different things lol
[04:48:02] <Whiskey> :P
[04:48:06] <seutje> I'm drawing a map from shitty data the government gave me \o/
[04:48:21] <seutje> fuckers don't even seem to know where their jurisdiction ends q.q
[04:49:59] <Paladine> Whiskey - you may find this helpful - https://gist.github.com/Haacked/7729259
[04:50:24] <Paladine> seutje, I am developing an entirely new paradigm for Privacy Policies - wanna swap?
[04:51:08] <seutje> if it means the client will stop filing bug reports on their own data set, sure :D
[04:51:39] <Paladine> well at least you only have 1 client right?  I have to please the entire world lol
[04:52:22] <seutje> hah, I wish
[04:52:24] <Whiskey> <[a-zA-Z\/][^>]*> _D
[04:52:29] <seutje> getting feedback from the grandma of the janitor
[04:52:44] <seutje> cause she used a map once
[04:53:11] <seutje> I love drawing interactive map thingies, don't get me wrong
[04:53:33] <Paladine> I am not even a developer, I haven't written any code in like 8 years, but have to do this cos no-one else will lol
[04:53:36] <seutje> but seriously, don't report a certain town to be missing from the map when it's not even in the same country
[04:54:02] <Paladine> last time I did any javascript was in 2000
[04:54:15] <seutje> Paladine: tbh, even after ur done, most ppl will ignore it
[04:54:37] <Paladine> nah I have a lot of followers in the privacy world
[04:54:58] <seutje> there you have it, it's a  world of its own
[04:55:04] <Paladine> if it works out well, a lot of orgs will use it, already getting enquiries about whether I will set it up for some big companies
[04:55:23] <Paladine> anyway back to work, good luck with your map
[04:55:31] <seutje> more like good luck with the client :P
[04:57:36] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/SsJsL/409/ that was the longest i come, how do i get it on whole page and not whit yeh whatever it calls
[06:17:44] <snackin> When I view the jquerymobile1.4 demo page, the 'View Source' buttons show up as 'View Sour...'   I noticed that all my data-mini buttons on my jquerymobile1.4 pages also do this ( adding ... to the button tags )  It does render ok if you access from a smart phone, but not from a desktop with Google Chrome... The data-mini font size was not an issue before 1.4... any ideas on how to fix this?
[07:26:15] <Durin_> Hi
[07:26:33] <softplay> hello
[07:26:45] <Durin_> I have a question concerning jQuery Mobile 1.4
[07:27:25] <softplay> anyone know how to display a piece of text as selected in a div with jquery javascript or changing css in jquery javascript?
[07:28:24] <fabioportieri> softplay: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5379120/get-the-highlighted-selected-text
[07:28:42] <Durin_> If a button is clicked in jQuery Mobile 1.4 the button shows a click effect (grey color) but if i change only the content of the site the button remains clicked ( remains grey). How can i fix this?
[07:28:49] <softplay> tnks fabioportieri (grazie!)
[07:29:49] <Karpuragauram> nice to be back
[07:43:54] <Sam4872847> anyway, what I'm trying to do is create a number of elements, put them into a jQuery result set, do .attr('groupId',x), and prepend the whole thing into the dom
[07:43:56] <Vivekananda> so whole night yesterday freenode was wonky and so I couldnt be around and trouble shooted my problem albeit with a lot of time spent
[07:44:00] <Sam4872847> into a particular place on the dom
[07:44:24] <andrew9183> hello
[07:44:40] <Sam4872847> the error I keep getting is ""Cannot read property 'ownerDocument' of undefined" inside jQuery
[07:44:54] <Sam4872847> where I believe it checks to see if the elements being added are already in the document where it's being added to
[07:45:15] <Sam4872847> I'm wondering if that's an oversight bug, or what the proper way of doing this is
[07:57:34] <Durin_> If a button is clicked in jQuery Mobile 1.4 the button shows a click effect (grey color) but if i change only the content of the site the button remains clicked ( remains grey). How can i fix this?
[08:00:15] <bumbar_> does anyone know if it's possible to use regex filtering on server side with datatables plugin?
[08:00:24] <Vivekananda> are any of my friends around ?
[08:00:46] <Vivekananda> bumbar_: databases ( mysql I guess) already have regex expressoins in them
[08:00:52] <Vivekananda> so you can use them directly in the db
[08:01:36] <bumbar_> Vivekananda: http://datatables.net/ not databases :)
[08:02:49] <Vivekananda> bumbar_: my bad :)
[08:08:09] <softplay> is execCommand a function in jquery?

[08:20:39] <walidvb_> hey guys, i can't figure out why my carousel isn't working anymore on this page: http://next.lezoo.ch/
[08:20:39] <walidvb_> the left and right controls behave weirdly, but i'm bad at debugging events, maybe someone could walk me through the debugging of it?

[09:14:10] <DevePy> Hello, How to handle data in different DIV $.ajax http://jsfiddle.net/x2m8W/
[09:15:51] <Vivekananda> hey everyone
[09:22:13] <duch_kazatel> DevePy that's not a complete code example.
[09:22:51] <duch_kazatel> DevePy that's apart of a larger object declaraion
[09:23:37] <DevePy> duch_kazatel: I'm try optimize for return data whit html
[09:23:49] <DevePy> resultData
[09:24:10] <duch_kazatel> DevePy what's your specific question?
[09:24:40] <DevePy> duch_kazatel: What is the best way to pass data to my template organized manner, I'm having trouble to show in divs.
[09:24:46] <DevePy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21521976/how-to-return-data-multiple-when-i-have-multiple-div
[09:25:10] <duch_kazatel> your callback function will have to manage that all for you.
[09:25:26] <duch_kazatel> you have a data object - you'll have to massage it however you see fit.
[09:40:17] <Vivekananda> hello everyone. if I dont place an ajax request in its proper broken down format but just do a $get(url , param, function) and if the return type is json will jquery know this ?
[09:41:09] <jphase> Vivekananda: you can use things like $.parseJSON(response) to parse as JSON and if it's not JSON it'll throw an error
[09:41:18] <jphase> or perhaps just be {} I can't remember
[09:43:19] <Sam4872847> How do you build up a list of objects and insert them all into one place in the DOM?  I can do that with individual items, but not with .prepend($(array-of-jquery-built-things))
[09:43:45] <Sam4872847> the reason I want a list of them is to set .attr('groupId',x)
[09:44:22] <shoky> Vivekananda: jquery will guess based on the response's content-type header. but to be on the safeside you should specify a 'json' dataType. you can also specify it when using $.get
[09:44:55] <blue_warlock> hi guys
[09:45:16] <blue_warlock> how do i add a listner on div's width change ?
[09:45:49] <Vivekananda> shoky: nice to see you back :)
[09:45:50] <blue_warlock> i wish something happens when the div width become lower than 400
[09:46:15] <Vivekananda> so yesterday night freenode was wonky and I solved one issue myself and onto this final one
[09:46:35] <Vivekananda> if I solve this then I am pretty much on a built prototype for my search
[09:46:42] <shoky> Sam4872847: you can make an array of elements, with or without a jquery wrapper. example with:  var els = $(); els.append(whatever).append(smth);  els.prependTo('#smth')
[09:46:56] <shoky> Vivekananda you too
[09:47:30] <Vivekananda> okay so onto my two questions
[09:48:44] <Vivekananda>  1. I called customcomplete on an element like this $('div').customcomplete({}); and worked fine but I need to call it on each key up. The reason will be clearer in the second question. Now the way I found is to do  $('div').on('keyup').customcomplete({ });   but I am not sure if this is the best way
[09:49:12] <shoky> that's not how you use .on
[09:49:24] <shoky> and it sounds like a bad thing to try to do, anyway
[09:49:41] <Sam4872847> shoky:  That's incorrect.  Since the set is empty, append won't do anything, since it wants to append to each of the individual elements
[09:49:49] <Sam4872847> also, .add() does not guarantee ordering, which I want
[09:50:00] <shoky> Sam4872847 right sorry, i meant to use .add
[09:50:05] <shoky> hm it doesn't?
[09:50:11] <Sam4872847> nope, read the docs
[09:50:19] <shoky> well then make an array?
[09:50:25] <Sam4872847> right, that's what I do
[09:51:17] <Vivekananda> shoky: it did work though and did not gimme an error. Also there is a good reason for using that on. I am not looking at local data but on each keypress I am asking a script to parse database stuff and send values up
[09:51:22] <Sam4872847> it gives errors about ""Cannot read property 'ownerDocument' of undefined", when trying to analyze what to do during prepend, I presume since the elements aren't attached to anything
[09:51:22] <Vivekananda> hence the need of keyup
[09:51:46] <shoky> Sam4872847 that comment in the .add docs is about preserving document order, if you .add elements that are already in the DOM
[09:51:57] <shoky> Sam4872847 i'm sure it preserves order when you add new elements
[09:52:00] <Sam4872847> I'm creating new elements, so they're not attached to the dom
[09:52:07] <Sam4872847> well, I'll give it a whirl then
[09:52:20] <shoky> need to use it like: o = o.add(stuff)
[09:52:28] <shoky> if you want to mutate o
[09:52:48] <shoky> Vivekananda: no, it didn't work
[09:53:03] <shoky> Vivekananda: the .on doesn't do anything when called like that
[09:53:41] <shoky> just cause it didn't give an error, doesn't mean it's correct usage
[09:54:03] <shoky> Vivekananda: you don't need the keyup. the autocomplete widget already does the event handling for you. that's exactly why you use it in the first place, because it does stuff for you
[09:54:30] <shoky> there is absolutely NO sense to use keyup yourself
[09:54:33] <eN_Joy> can someone take a look here: http://jsfiddle.net/2kMXT/ i am trying to use jQuery jPlayer to play an external mp3, I have no problem download the mp3 at link http://data10.5sing.com/T1T5VTB4ET1R47IVrK.mp3 with many browsers and even `wget`, however when the code is used, i got 403 Forbidden for the mp3, I am suspecting that jQuery sends diffferent request header to the server, but my knowlege is very limited on this regards, i appreciate if someone ca
[09:56:36] <Vivekananda> hmmm ( although the web guys said differently but they might not know it it depth) so kay then for that question I have the fiddle let me get it for you.
[09:56:54] <snover> eN_Joy: the service clearly does not want you hotlinking to their shit. so stop it.
[09:58:30] <eN_Joy> snover: i see, so nothing to do w/ jquery?
[09:58:44] <snover> no. nothing to do with jquery.
[09:59:16] <blue_warlock> nobody knows '
[09:59:19] <blue_warlock> ?
[10:01:55] <BillCriswell> Freenode still getting DOSed?
[10:02:03] <jedimind> yup
[10:02:05] <eN_Joy> snover: well i am still curious: i tried to embed the link in a flash based player, no problem, with Windows Media Player, no problem... I just want to learn what is going on there...
[10:02:07] <jedimind> ddosed
[10:02:20] <BillCriswell> I'd love to know why.
[10:04:06] <Vivekananda> shoky: here is my working fiddle ( partly working hurray !) and also with the incorrect use of the onkeyup. line 48. I am playing around it a bit too but now my question is :  if the source in line 50 is NoT  a local variable but actualy a get request then will the widget keep doing "get" after each keypress automatically ?
[10:04:10] <blue_warlock> how do i add a listener on a div width ?
[10:04:36] <duch_kazatel> blue_warlock you don't
[10:05:19] <BillCriswell> blue_warlock: It sounds like a bad approach, but you might be able to hack something up with an animation end event.
[10:05:22] <shoky> Vivekananda: and the link?
[10:05:51] <jedimind> BillCriswell some kids are upset hence ddos :(
[10:06:48] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[10:07:33] <blue_warlock> hum how ? BillCriswell ?
[10:08:06] <blue_warlock> wy a bad approach i wish just to change some html and compress items when div width become lower than 400
[10:08:06] <Vivekananda> shoky: the link is a local .php file
[10:08:51] <Vivekananda> shoky: that is also part of my second question ie the link part
[10:11:44] <Vivekananda> havent pasted it yet but am about to. I was hoping to wrap up this question and move to this next one
[10:13:22] <BillCriswell> What do you mean compress?
[10:15:08] <pu239> i'm loading some data into a div when i click a button, then i have an x for closing the content that was just loaded
[10:15:17] <pu239> i can't seem to get the x to work, here is a simple example - http://jsfiddle.net/FMLLb/
[10:15:28] <pu239> i'm guessing i'm missing something obvious
[10:15:51] <duch_kazatel> pu239 you can't bind events to things that don't exist at time of binding.
[10:16:03] <duch_kazatel> go look up how to use event delegation.
[10:16:06] <pu239> duch_kazatel: ah, that makes sense
[10:16:16] <pu239> you told me that once before, apologies for the repeat
[10:16:21] <pu239> thanks for the help
[10:16:44] <blue_warlock> wut is anymation event BillCriswell ?
[10:17:09] <shoky> Vivekananda: huh? you said "here is my working fiddle" and didn't give any fiddle
[10:17:11] <duch_kazatel> pu239 that's fine.
[10:17:19] <Vivekananda> shoky sorry one moment :)
[10:17:27] <shoky> Vivekananda: anyway i gotta go. duch_kazatel will help you ;)
[10:17:40] <Vivekananda> ok no worries and thanks
[10:17:50] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: may I trouble you ?
[10:17:54] <shoky> ;DD
[10:18:44] <Vivekananda> here is my working fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/hx72G/18/
[10:21:23] <BillCriswell> blue_warlock: It's actually not working as smoothly as I hoped. It appears I have to modify the height directly to trigger the transitionEnd event.
[10:22:04] <blue_warlock> i have found a theme
[10:22:15] <blue_warlock> using some code to trigger the event
[10:22:27] <blue_warlock> http://themezee.com/themes/zeeflow/
[10:24:40] <BillCriswell> I don't know what this has to do with what I was helping you with.
[10:37:06] <blue_warlock> the event i need is on menus
[10:37:10] <blue_warlock> like that one
[10:37:54] <Vivekananda> In my working fiddle, I have used the autocomplete ui as my guide. The problem is it takes a local variable as source and I need a ".get".  I am working on this new fiddle now  -  http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/hx72G/21/ . 'results' ( line 7) represents how the json source looks. if I use that variable directly then autocom works . line 101 and 128 are two versions I am trying to test and make work with.  My question 1. for vers
[10:37:54] <Vivekananda> ion 128  how do I give json return type to .get ?  2. version 101 is for some reason returning the entire db and not considering the arguments. Am I sending arguments correctly in line 108 ?
[10:38:32] <Vivekananda> my working fiddle is -- http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/hx72G/18/
[10:44:14] <blue_warlock> uff
[10:49:32] <zitter> Hi, I have a form. I want an option that if I change values in one or more inputs and *after* I click on a link, an alert tells me:"Are you sure to change page?". What I have to search on big G to do that?
[10:51:00] <drewery> in a div, there this html5 attribute DATA ...I am wondering how I can read its value and store it in a variable to be used in the script later
[10:51:02] <drewery> any help?
[10:51:17] <iredmedia> yes
[10:51:44] <iredmedia> $(element).data('name') where the 'name' is data-name
[10:52:24] <iredmedia> var value = $(element).data('name')
[10:52:33] <drewery> iredmedia: right... thanks a lot
[10:52:36] <iredmedia> np :)
[10:52:59] <BillCriswell> zitter: I would save a "copy" of the form, then on submit I'd compare the values.
[10:53:33] <zitter> Bill, thanks maybe I've found a pllugin https://github.com/codedance/jquery.AreYouSure
[10:57:57] <Vivekananda> drewery: 'body'.val('div.DATA') ? not sure if that will work for sure so plz try
[10:57:59] <BillCriswell> zitter: Seems like it should be fine. I was going to use serializeArray() on the form at page load then again on form submit or window before unload.
[10:58:11] <Vivekananda> $('body') of course
[11:02:04] <synth__> http://mellow.me/bbmh/ would anyone be able to help me debug some animation on this? when a user scrolls or clicks a nav item, it will smooth scroll to the section. the animation for smooth scrolling is also offsetting the center of the "thumbnail" (info block) per section upon each step, however, the "thumbnail" tends to pop at the very end of the animation. could anyone offer some advice for
[11:02:04] <synth__> fixing this? i was assuming the animation for offsetting the center would be as smooth as the actual smooth scrolling since it's being performed per step.
[11:05:38] <iredmedia> synth__: You can try and trick the browser into using hardware acceleration? Give transforms a try, they're faster then positioning/margins
[11:06:06] <iredmedia> synth__: Also, lookup RAF, requestAnimationFrame
[11:06:37] <synth__> iredmedia transforms? got a link?
[11:07:55] <iredmedia> synth__: Dom operations are expensive. You could get a lot of performance benefits from simply checking if the element is on screen :) It's CSS3, check here. http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_transform.asp HW acceleration occurs when using '3d' things, like rotate3d(0,0,0), translateZ(0), translate3d(0,0,0) etc
[11:09:50] <synth__> iredmedia hmm okay.. i thought i was only animating the css for it if it was on screen i'll double check
[11:11:14] <Hackwar1> hi folks, I'm trying to use this plugin: http://www.bkosborne.com/jquery-waterwheel-carousel and I have jquery 1.10.2 on my site. somehow, when adding this to my site, the site simply keeps on reloading all the time. what am I doing wrong? Or rather, is jQuery 1.9 incompatible with 1.10? Or can somebody help me spot the bug in the code?
[11:11:46] <duch_kazatel> "is jQuery 1.9 incompatible with 1.10?" - are you loading both versions?
[11:12:25] <Hackwar1> no
[11:12:31] <duch_kazatel> ah, this supports 1.4 - 1.9
[11:12:35] <duch_kazatel> shouldn't be an issue.
[11:12:40] <Hackwar1> but the plugin says that it supports up to 1.9
[11:12:55] <Hackwar1> I thought so, but something is seriously wrong there.
[11:13:07] <duch_kazatel> have you tried dropping the version of jquery, then?
[11:13:09] <Hackwar1> do you know another script that generates a similar gallery?
[11:13:13] <duch_kazatel> 1.8 to 1.9 was a big change iirc.
[11:13:24] <Hackwar1> the jquery version is the version that is shipped with Joomla
[11:13:35] <Hackwar1> I'd rather not change that
[11:13:51] <iredmedia> Why not?
[11:14:15] <duch_kazatel> for testing?
[11:14:22] <Hackwar1> because that evaluates to a core hack and that creates problems with the other JS etc.
[11:14:37] <duch_kazatel> okay, and when you remove the gallery it works fine?
[11:14:44] <Hackwar1> yes
[11:15:07] <Vivekananda> hey everyone again
[11:15:20] <Vivekananda> I was hoping someone would look at y question
[11:15:49] <Vivekananda> shok y ran away :(  :) :)
[11:18:42] <duch_kazatel> Hackwar1 without fixing the plugin itself, you'll have to find an alternative.  Not sure of any that look exactly like that but I'm sure one existsd.
[11:18:46] <drewery> thanks Vivekananda, will keep that in mind
[11:19:13] <Es0teric> ok so lets say i have a var that keeps incrementing by 1 on every click, how do i detect when the click reaches the last number? (of course this number updates dynamically with the clicks)
[11:20:01] <duch_kazatel> "the last number" - how are you determining the last number?
[11:20:24] <petey> What am I doing wrong if a resource is interpreted as an image but transferred as HTML?
[11:20:40] <petey> The thing is, if I isolate the issue, it works fine, and I do not get the error. Once I throw it back into the project, I get this error.
[11:20:42] <Hackwar1> duch_kazatel: do you know a good search term for such a plugin? I don't really know how to call that image effect...
[11:21:02] <duch_kazatel> Hackwar1 it's a carousel.  other than that not really sure what to tell you.
[11:22:29] <Hackwar1> thx
[11:22:55] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel give me a sec
[11:23:06] <duch_kazatel> i am going on lunch.
[11:23:07] <duch_kazatel> be back later.
[11:24:41] <petey> I'm transferring HTML and I want to transfer the darn HTML but getting Resource interpreted as Image but transferred with MIME type text/html
[11:24:50] <petey> why would it interpret it as an image if I WANT to transfer HTML?
[11:24:53] <Vivekananda> I figured it out myself :)
[11:26:57] <zumba_addict> hey folks, is it true that IE9 does not support PUT method?
[11:27:36] <zumba_addict> so I'm going to try the code here, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18920266/ajax-is-not-supporting-ie-9
[11:38:53] <Es0teric> ok so i have this code -> http://pastie.org/private/qhcsvdq1wxa867atmha2q and line 19 seems to be still passing eventhough currentNumber is undefined
[11:41:33] <zumba_addict> hey folks, the $.ajax solution written on this page, what method could it be using? Is it POST or PUT? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18079303/javascript-xmlhttprequest-wont-send-with-ie-8-or-9-but-works-with-ie-10
[11:43:20] <alan_> get by default i believe
[11:50:55] <BillCriswell> It has xhr.open("POST", "ajax.pl", true) in there.
[11:51:30] <BillCriswell> Oh, nevermind.
[11:57:02] <drakythe> join #drupal-support
[11:58:00] <Es0teric> ok so i have this code -> http://pastie.org/private/qhcsvdq1wxa867atmha2q and line 19 seems to be still passing eventhough currentNumber is undefined
[12:01:31] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Why do you think currentNumber isn't defined?
[12:01:56] <Es0teric> BillCriswell when i reach the final .section div, i get this error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined
[12:02:22] <zumba_addict> I don't see post on the solution
[12:02:24] <Es0teric> BillCriswell so i dont understand why its saying it isnt defined when i already set the typeof condition
[12:02:53] <BillCriswell> zumba_addict: It's get by default.
[12:02:58] <zumba_addict> k
[12:03:18] <walidvb> hey guys, i can't figure out why my carousel isn't working anymore on this page: http://next.lezoo.ch/
[12:03:19] <walidvb> the left and right controls behave weirdly, but i'm bad at debugging events, maybe someone could walk me through the debugging of it?
[12:03:39] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: I'm guessing $('#section' + currentNumber) doesn't exist
[12:03:46] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: What is your goal exactly?
[12:04:07] <Es0teric> BillCriswell well i want to detect the last .section and show the "up" arrow
[12:04:27] <Es0teric> so i figured if it says "undefined" im at the last one.. so i set the typeof condition
[12:07:00] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: So if they click through and they arrive at the last section?
[12:07:22] <BillCriswell> If you set up a demo at jsbin.com it might be easier to follow.
[12:08:26] <Es0teric> BillCriswell let me go through my history, i have a demo
[12:09:50] <Es0teric> BillCriswell -> http://jsfiddle.net/v9W9Q/35/
[12:18:06] <synth__> is there a way to set the window hash without it actually going to that hash?
[12:18:14] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: To approach it this way you'll need to know how many sections you have. You would need to put a way to keep it from going over 3 just like you keep it from going below 1.
[12:19:11] <synth__> i find i can do window.location.hash fine with chrome, but when i use firefox, since my vertical offset is different than where the hash is placed, when i set window.location.hash, it scrolls to that hash automatically
[12:19:14] <duch_kazatel> haha I wrote that part of his code originally.
[12:21:31] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I'm having a terrible... logic day?
[12:21:47] <Tomashe> there is a way to convert the entire contact object and send it using ajax?
[12:21:59] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel yeah lol
[12:22:33] <duch_kazatel> those days are the wost.
[12:22:36] <Es0teric> BillCriswell that ideaâ¦ hmm i can just do var section = $('.section').length();
[12:22:53] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric would the amount of sections ever change after pageload?
[12:22:58] <Es0teric> or $('.section').children().length()
[12:23:03] <jphase> Tomashe: I suppose that would depend on what "the entire contact object" is, but I'd suggest looking into .serialize()
[12:23:22] <Tomashe> its object tree
[12:23:25] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel theres always a possibility of there being more sections that will be added
[12:23:26] <Tomashe> serialize? or u sure
[12:23:35] <Es0teric> but i am not sure if that answers your question
[12:23:42] <Tomashe> actually i think json is the best
[12:23:47] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric I mean added while the user on on the page.
[12:23:49] <duch_kazatel> not down the road.
[12:23:50] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel nope
[12:23:50] <Tomashe> but how do i do it
[12:23:55] <duch_kazatel> rad one sec.
[12:24:02] <Es0teric> if a section is added, the user will have to reload the page to see the new section
[12:24:25] <jphase> Tomashe: .serialize is often used to serialize form data and send via ajax.
[12:24:45] <jphase> am I crazy in thinking I'm supposed to get a result from console.log($('iframe')); ?
[12:24:50] <Tomashe> i know that jphase , more into transform it into json strong
[12:24:51] <jphase> perhaps this is just an android thing
[12:24:54] <Tomashe> but i have no idea how
[12:25:10] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric http://jsfiddle.net/v9W9Q/41/
[12:25:11] <jphase> Tomashe: loop through your form elements and build an object then
[12:25:12] <duch_kazatel> enjoy :)
[12:26:19] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel i KNEW ITâ¦ i had to do something with .length
[12:26:30] <Es0teric> lol
[12:26:34] <Tomashe> i just heard about stringify() < is that any good?
[12:26:50] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric yup.  simple comparisons.
[12:26:56] <jphase> Tomashe: sure
[12:27:28] <jphase> console.log($('iframe'))  =  Uncaught TypeError: object is not a function    ??? Anyone care to give me a facepalm?
[12:28:32] <BillCriswell> jphase: Sure $ is jquery?
[12:28:43] <duch_kazatel> jphase is there code before or after that console.log();
[12:29:17] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel man thanks for the help with the codeâ¦ i mean i am not implimenting it exactly like the fiddle but the codebase is practically the same lol
[12:29:29] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric it's all good man.
[12:29:30] <jphase> http://paste.ofcode.org/qbTeFTFe78PvBwzU2fZSEp
[12:29:36] <duch_kazatel> as long as you're understanding what's going on./
[12:30:01] <BillCriswell> jphase: I think the $ would be an event object there?
[12:30:17] <jphase> doh
[12:31:11] <jphase> indeed, thx BillCriswell
[12:31:16] <farn5w0rth> how do i limit the number of lines in a table column to 2 and then add a button that lets the user expand each row?
[12:31:24] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[12:33:24] <BillCriswell> jphase: If you do jQuery( document ).ready(function( $ ){ ... }); I think you can use it that way... Now that I look at that it seems odd.
[12:33:59] <duch_kazatel> be cool and use the shorter one - $(function() {});
[12:34:01] <jphase> I'm not used to working in conflict
[12:34:30] <BillCriswell> shorter, but less verbose.. .if i'm using that word right
[12:34:51] <duch_kazatel> or if you need to use noconflict but still want the dollar sign neatness: jQuery(function($) { });
[12:35:14] <duch_kazatel> it might be less verbose but it tells you exactly what it's going to do :)
[12:36:20] <synth__> is it possible to rewrite the window.location.hash without actually navigating to that hash?
[12:36:29] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: $(function() {}); this does?
[12:36:42] <duch_kazatel> yup
[12:36:57] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I'm not sure I'm following there haha
[12:37:09] <duch_kazatel> call the jquery function and pass a function to it :)
[12:37:16] <duch_kazatel> the jquery function only runs when the document is ready
[12:37:27] <duch_kazatel> synth__ try to capture the event and prevent it?
[12:38:13] <synth__> duch_kazatel i am, however, firefox doesn't obey it: http://mellow.me/bbmh/ click a nav link
[12:38:19] <synth__> do it in firefox though
[12:38:36] <synth__> actually, it's doing it in chrome too
[12:38:37] <duch_kazatel> i use firefox by default.
[12:38:51] <duch_kazatel> are you capturing the hashchange event?
[12:39:37] <synth__> duch_kazatel http://pastebin.com/6UyKq3vc
[12:39:40] <duch_kazatel> try something like $(document).on('hashchange', function(e){e.preventDefault});
[12:39:53] <wa5ted> hi jquery
[12:39:53] <synth__> okay
[12:39:58] <duch_kazatel> try that outside of this click handler.
[12:40:06] <synth__> okay let me give that a shot
[12:40:37] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: So passing a function to $ will only run after the document is ready?
[12:40:59] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell as long as it's after you load jquery, basically.
[12:41:18] <alaing> evenign ppl
[12:41:48] <synth__> duch_kazatel it's not working :\
[12:41:51] <alaing> anyone else read Javascript: The good parts"?
[12:42:10] <BillCriswell> I still tihnk it's easier to understand $(document).ready() if you're not familiar with jQuery haah
[12:42:44] <BillCriswell> I need a nap.
[12:43:00] <alaing> BillCriswell: I agree with you...
[12:43:08] <alaing> I still use .ready()
[12:43:25] <alaing> just because tthe other developers on my team arent familiar with jquery
[12:43:29] <farn5w0rth> how do i limit the number of lines in a table column to 2 and then add a button that lets the user expand each row?
[12:43:39] <alaing> and deal mainky with backend stufff
[12:43:45] <BillCriswell> I don't use either really, most of the time my scripts are running before </body>
[12:43:52] <BillCriswell> alaing: Indeed!
[12:44:22] <alaing> BillCriswell: Ah yes the neat "document" must be ready if its at the end trick
[12:44:48] <BillCriswell> farn5w0rth: Might be able to do something with overflow hidden and height auto?
[12:44:53] <alaing> farn5w0rth: $('table tr:lt(2)')
[12:45:31] <farn5w0rth> alaing: whats lt?
[12:45:37] <alaing> less than
[12:45:46] <farn5w0rth> BillCriswell: thats a good idea - just use css?
[12:45:57] <farn5w0rth> oh
[12:46:30] <alaing> farn5w0rth: http://api.jquery.com/lt-selector/
[12:46:41] <alaing> 2 is the index
[12:46:54] <farn5w0rth> nice
[12:48:33] <BillCriswell> farn5w0rth: Needed to use a div inside the <td>s since the height and overflow on them didn't seem to work: http://jsbin.com/oROQOGO/1/edit?html,js,output
[12:49:09] <farn5w0rth> oh sweet BillCriswell thanks!
[12:49:46] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[12:50:18] <alaing> BillCriswell: thats pretty neat solution
[12:51:03] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/oROQOGO/2/edit?html,js,output would be a bit more efficient.
[12:51:50] <alaing> BillCriswell: of course lol
[12:52:07] <alaing> no point adding the click events directly on the tdss themselves
[12:53:00] <BillCriswell> alaing: Yeah. I always forget about using event delegation unless I need to. Pretty bad habit.
[12:53:07] <Sarlonga> hello internet
[12:53:49] <alaing> Sarlonga: You should practice "Hello World" on jsfiddle or jsbin :-P
[12:54:00] <Sarlonga> I have a div that animates its height from 500px to 100px when the user scrolls y > 800 . It contains a img in it, and when the user leaves the mouse still, the image instead of hiding, shows itself all over the content
[12:54:03] <Sarlonga> someone knows how to fix that?
[12:54:38] <alaing> Sarlonga: knock up an example on jsfiddle.net
[12:55:14] <alaing> time for some assasin creed
[12:55:31] <alaing> chat laters ppl
[12:55:46] <BillCriswell> alaing_away: Later.
[12:56:35] <BillCriswell> Sarlonga: That sounds off. Do you have it live anywhere to see? Are you using a background image or an <img> tag?
[12:57:31] <Sarlonga> http://jsfiddle.net/f4u86/
[12:57:42] <Sarlonga> Scroll down
[12:57:48] <Sarlonga> and see how it flickers before it completes
[12:59:00] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel quick question, to hide the bottom arrow after the total number has been reached, it would be if(currentNumber === totalNumber) { //hide arrow pointing down, show arrow pointing up }
[12:59:06] <Sarlonga> Did you guys saw it?
[12:59:15] <Es0teric> right?
[12:59:24] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric yeah you'll want to add a check in there like that.
[13:01:27] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel yeah i did that and once that becomes true, and i click the "up" arrow once, it goes back to the down arrowâ¦ so i think i would want to make it so that until it currentNumber reaches 1 again, to not display the up arrow
[13:01:36] <Es0teric> *to not display the down arrow
[13:02:39] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric fiddle again?
[13:02:46] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel let me update it real quick
[13:03:15] <BillCriswell> Sarlonga: http://jsfiddle.net/f4u86/1/ is this what you're going for?
[13:04:09] <jedimind> ew
[13:04:19] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel -> http://jsfiddle.net/v9W9Q/42/
[13:05:09] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric you're way off - need to do in inside your click handlers.  I'll add one for you real quick.
[13:05:47] <bryanculver> Anyone know how to push chrome to maintain onclick events on links even after pressing the back button?
[13:06:07] <duch_kazatel> bryanculver if the page reloads, you cannot.
[13:07:02] <bryanculver> So if I have a form validation script on a button and someone presses the back button after submitting, then tries filling out the form again, it won't form validate
[13:07:07] <bryanculver> Is that expected?
[13:07:27] <duch_kazatel> bryanculver sounds like you're doing something wrong.
[13:07:32] <BillCriswell> bryanculver: That doesn't sound right. Pressing the back button shouldn't basically disable javascript.
[13:07:34] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric one sec.
[13:07:38] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel alright
[13:07:45] <bryanculver> That's what I'm thinking
[13:07:53] <bryanculver> But I can't get this to work right
[13:08:16] <bryanculver> I am hoping around the site and only when I force refresh the page do the onclicks actually work
[13:08:23] <Vivekananda> hey everyone I have a working 'categories' autocmplete ui. I am trying to enhance it now. my aim is to have submenus in the main menu. and also to hide the menus
[13:08:37] <bryanculver> I've tried both $(window).load() and $(document).ready()
[13:08:49] <Tomashe> wierd im using stringify() to convert my object.. and then using ajax to send that object
[13:08:53] <Tomashe> but from some reason its not sending
[13:09:02] <Tomashe> data: { data : contact_json }
[13:09:06] <BillCriswell> What are you doing in there? $('form').someValidatePlugin()?
[13:09:44] <BillCriswell> Tomashe: What is contact_json? A string of json data?
[13:10:01] <Tomashe> yes
[13:10:34] <bryanculver> BillCriswell: just some simple if then statements to see if a few fields are blank
[13:10:46] <bryanculver> if they are, it runs event.preventDefault()
[13:11:21] <BillCriswell> When you hit back the inputs on the form should be what the user entered previously. Are you expecting that?
[13:11:42] <BillCriswell> Tomashe: And what's the issue?
[13:11:54] <bryanculver> Yes, that I don't care about
[13:12:12] <bryanculver> But if I clear a field and then press the submit again, it doesn't run any form validation
[13:12:54] <synth__> duch_kazatel: not sure if you saw earlier, but  $(window).on('hashchange', function(e){e.preventDefault();}); doesn't seem to work
[13:12:55] <BillCriswell> Is there any error in the console?
[13:13:22] <bryanculver> Nope
[13:13:26] <bryanculver> Not that I can see
[13:13:27] <duch_kazatel> synth__ try using document instead of window?
[13:13:55] <synth__> i tried both, i logged the event to the console too with window and it definitely logs the event
[13:14:07] <BillCriswell> bryanculver: Hard to debug without it in front of me.
[13:14:44] <bryanculver> BillCriswell: I'll see if I can get a safe demo up online to show it. Unfortunately it's an internal work application
[13:15:30] <bryanculver> Is there anything you can think Rails might be doing to it, like it already calling window.load once and my calling doesn't get called on the back button?
[13:16:18] <duch_kazatel> rails can't call window.load :)
[13:16:47] <Tomashe> running ajax from function is legit syntax right?
[13:16:53] <duch_kazatel> synth__ look for the event canceler that's something like stopImmediatePropogation(
[13:18:26] <synth__> duch_kazetel unfortunately that doesn't work either
[13:19:05] <bryanculver> duch_kazatel: I know, but I mean it having a section of code that already has window.load in it
[13:19:55] <duch_kazatel> synth__ welp: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/hashchange
[13:19:58] <duch_kazatel> "Cancelable
[13:19:58] <duch_kazatel>     No
[13:20:02] <duch_kazatel> there's your answer.
[13:20:09] <synth__> >.>
[13:20:10] <Tomashe> tell me , if i set var x = 1 outside of my function  , can i use it inside my functin?
[13:20:17] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe yes.
[13:20:27] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe if it's declared in a parent scope.
[13:20:30] <Tomashe> damn so i have no idea whats wrong with my ajax post
[13:22:30] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric http://jsfiddle.net/v9W9Q/44/
[13:22:34] <duch_kazatel> it'll look something like that.
[13:23:07] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric you can do it in your animation handler as well, but you need to check each arrow independently because of that whole pesky middle slider issue.
[13:23:13] <duch_kazatel> s/slider/section
[13:24:58] <Sarlonga> Someone knows why this is flickering? Scroll down http://jsfiddle.net/f4u86/
[13:25:35] <duch_kazatel> I'm not seeing any flickering.
[13:25:58] <duch_kazatel> oh, in chrome i am.
[13:26:18] <duch_kazatel> make sure you're setting some css on it when the animation completes to it "holds" the state you want it to.
[13:26:44] <duch_kazatel> s/to/so
[13:30:21] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel right right let me check it out real quick
[13:33:13] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel the arrow_top still shows regardless
[13:50:18] <Vivekananda> anyone around ?
[13:50:23] <duch_kazatel> `ask
[13:50:24] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:50:59] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda be aware that freenode IS under a DDoS attack right now, so you may or may not be able to get much assistance anyway
[13:51:08] <Vivekananda> yes I understand
[13:51:18] <Vivekananda> no worries
[13:51:46] <duch_kazatel> but just ask your question either way :)
[13:53:22] <Vivekananda> I use autocomplete ui and specify source as function , response. if I just say :  response () { return data} ; or response(data) ; both dont work alhtough response is in json format. but if I do  response ( $ .map ...) { label : "hello" ... } then everything works
[13:54:35] <Vivekananda> am referring to lines 35 -7 of http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp
[13:56:38] <duch_kazatel> "lines 35 -7"? huh?
[13:56:45] <duch_kazatel> oh in the source.
[13:58:24] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda where's your code?
[13:59:17] <walidvb> hey guys, i can't figure out why my carousel isn't working anymore on this page: http://next.lezoo.ch/
[13:59:19] <walidvb> the left and right controls behave weirdly, but i'm bad at debugging events, maybe someone could walk me through the debugging of it?
[14:01:33] <duch_kazatel> walidvb might want to start by fixing the errors you're getting.
[14:01:53] <walidvb> duch_kazatel: ?
[14:01:59] <walidvb> i'm only getting a 404 here
[14:02:35] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: the code is not integrated into the fiddle but is working on my localhost . the functions I am referring to are lines 101 and 127  in here http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/hx72G/22/
[14:02:47] <walidvb> duch_kazatel: i mean, only error i get is a 404
[14:02:52] <walidvb> (for a png)
[14:04:07] <Vivekananda> I am using version 1 ( line 101) and I want to know why it does not work if I replace 116 117 118 with just the word :  data ?
[14:06:17] <blue_warlock> who cna give me an hand with this script
[14:06:19] <blue_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/W7d7r/19/
[14:07:02] <blue_warlock> i need to extract the #header width and if it goes under 400 must alert 'under 400'
[14:08:09] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda probably has something to do with how it needs the data back to analyize.
[14:08:27] <duch_kazatel> *analyze
[14:08:44] <walidvb> blue_warlock: you can't do that like that
[14:09:11] <blue_warlock> =(
[14:09:23] <walidvb> you need to watch $(window).resize()
[14:09:28] <blue_warlock> but i have found it on stackoverflow
[14:09:48] <walidvb> blue_warlock: link?
[14:10:01] <walidvb> whig is, that event you're listening to will never trigger
[14:10:08] <walidvb> unless you manually trigger it
[14:10:11] <igcewieling> I'm not all that great with jQuery, want to make sure I have the chaining order correct.  If I understand things correctly "$('#route_edit form :input').hasClass('ui-state-error').first().focus();" should make focus the first form input element inside #route_edit which has a class of ui-state-error
[14:10:17] <walidvb> duch_kazatel: any other hint? :)
[14:10:26] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: the funny thing is the "data" that is being used in the line 113 and is the .get response is the same as the results variable ( line 7) and  I am reformatting all that data back to the same format !! why is it then that reformatted one works but the data itself does not ?
[14:10:33] <igcewieling> is that correct?
[14:10:47] <Vivekananda> is there like a dereferencing of json object that I am missing ?
[14:10:52] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda because it's one big JSON object without the correct "headings" i'll bet.
[14:10:53] <Vivekananda> the 'data' is a json object
[14:11:13] <Vivekananda> that is what I am thinking too. hmm
[14:11:22] <blue_warlock> walidvb http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6492683/how-to-detect-divs-dimension-changed
[14:11:36] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda why not use use it the way it is now and let it work?
[14:11:45] <Vivekananda> lol where is the fun in that ?
[14:11:52] <duch_kazatel> not wasting time?
[14:11:52] <blue_warlock> the problem is its not just a check on resize
[14:11:53] <walidvb> http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/W7d7r/22/
[14:11:58] <walidvb> blue_warlock: ^
[14:12:28] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda unless your goal is to fully understand what you're doing.
[14:12:29] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: on a more serious note, I dont understand this which means if this thing troubles me again I would be in the same position again :(
[14:12:46] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: yep not fully but atelast understand well !
[14:12:50] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda it's pretty simple.
[14:13:01] <blue_warlock> ah thanks walidvb
[14:13:05] <blue_warlock> it works O.O
[14:13:09] <duch_kazatel> you need to map your current object into a format the plugin expects.
[14:13:17] <walidvb> blue_warlock: : what the example does is manually trigger the resize event on $('#header')
[14:13:24] <blue_warlock> yea
[14:13:36] <blue_warlock> but will it works if i open window under that size '
[14:13:42] <blue_warlock> ?
[14:13:48] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: okay I guess I got that partially and will test it later
[14:13:56] <Vivekananda> for now I wanted to ask something else
[14:14:24] <duch_kazatel> oj.
[14:14:26] <duch_kazatel> *ok
[14:14:30] <walidvb> blue_warlock: it'll work, as long as your header has a width:100%
[14:14:43] <walidvb> blue_warlock: otherwise, you'd have to find another way
[14:14:55] <blue_warlock> let me test it
[14:14:59] <walidvb> here, the header resizes when the window resizes
[14:15:47] <Vivekananda> the code autocomp widget works fine. I am using the code http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#categories as here. Now here there is a way to add a class to some "categories" which help change its color and stuff. How do I do the same thing for labels ?  I want to add a class to labels based on added color to categories
[14:16:41] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: if you wish I can use the same fiddle for this too and test it out
[14:16:44] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda "here there is a way to add a class to some "categories" which help change its color and stuff." - huh?
[14:17:14] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: I am referring to line 25 of the link http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#categories  source code
[14:18:15] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda that's just appending some HTML to a UL.
[14:18:32] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda said HTML happens to have a class on it.  that code isn't necessarily "setting" a class on anything.
[14:18:59] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda are you looking to add some html elsewhere on the page?
[14:19:36] <Vivekananda> no I want the elements of each category have a different color ( and later perhaps fold them too if I can do it )
[14:20:02] <duch_kazatel> then you'll have to check the category and write in a different class instead.
[14:20:47] <duch_kazatel> or write in the existing class plus another one.
[14:21:05] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: if you look at the working demo in that page you will see that the category words are bold and I can at the moment change all the category words
[14:21:28] <Vivekananda> but I dont know how to change the 'label' words ie the words that come below each category
[14:21:29] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda yup.
[14:22:07] <Vivekananda> the reason being there is no code there that appends the label words explicitly!
[14:22:15] <Vivekananda> ( they are self appending or somethng )
[14:23:09] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda no, look at lines 22, 23, and 24.
[14:24:19] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda are you working with Firebug or chrome's dev tools at all?
[14:25:29] <Vivekananda> yes I see them. if those lines are missing then the label words will still appear but the category words will vanish. eg in my fiddle if I comment out line 88 the code still works but just does not include the category words  --  http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/hx72G/22/
[14:25:56] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: I am :(. did I miss something very basic ?
[14:26:21] <Vivekananda> just input letter a in my code after commenting line 88
[14:26:41] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda and you want to make each one a unique color?
[14:27:15] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda because line 88 in your example is the code that writes in the labels.
[14:28:29] <Vivekananda> okay so let me put it this way. In my UNcommeneted code I want all the words as red : fruit, apple , mango , orange . how to do this ?
[14:29:21] <Vivekananda> I mean the output font color to be red for all these words when I type : a  in the box
[14:31:39] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda check item.cat and see if it matches your category
[14:32:53] <Vivekananda> if it does then how do I color up the fruits and append them ? There is not code for appending the fruits coz it is happenning in the background
[14:33:17] <duch_kazatel> it's not happening "in the background" it's all right in front of you :)
[14:35:36] <Vivekananda> wow I am really finding it diff to explain such a simple thing !! I am really slow with english . okay let me try again I dont know how to change font color for the words that appear Below the category name. Please point me to where that is being changed in the visible code and I will gladly follow it
[14:35:40] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda http://jsfiddle.net/hx72G/24/
[14:35:46] <duch_kazatel> here's the beginning of what you want.
[14:35:56] <blue_warlock> walidvb: http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/W7d7r/34/
[14:36:21] <blue_warlock> why doesnt work , and doesnt change in display:block ?
[14:36:22] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: you changed the word "fruit" to red
[14:36:36] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda correct - that's to point you in the right direction.
[14:37:17] <Vivekananda> but the words "apple" , "mango" , "orange" are still black.  Changing the color of the word "fruit" is not the problem coz the code for it is already there.
[14:37:49] <Vivekananda> I need to know how to change the color of the word "apple" to red.
[14:37:55] <Vivekananda> can you tell me that !
[14:38:08] <duch_kazatel> are you even trying with what I've given you?
[14:41:01] <Vivekananda> hmm okay
[14:41:08] <Vivekananda> if that works then I get the logic
[14:41:18] <Vivekananda> be back in a bit to test and work on it
[14:41:20] <duch_kazatel> there are a few different ways to do what you want.
[14:41:22] <duch_kazatel> but start there
[14:41:28] <Vivekananda> yes I can see that
[14:42:10] <Vivekananda> I just thought that similar to the problem of data not working as a response, the color of labels cannot be changed coz of different problems
[14:42:36] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda as you can see, the color of labels can be change.d
[14:42:38] <Vivekananda> I mean coz of problems that can occur in the background
[14:42:55] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[14:42:57] <igcewieling> does anyone have any ideas as to why console.log($('#route_edit form :input .ui-state-error').first().attr('id')); is returning 'undefined'?
[14:43:46] <duch_kazatel> igcewieling try removing each method from that chain, starting with the last, to see which one isn't returning.
[14:44:09] <duch_kazatel> igcewieling ie try $('#route_edit form :input .ui-state-error').first() and see if that returns something.  if not, try $('#route_edit form :input .ui-state-error')
[14:44:27] <moijk> phpstorm keep bugging me about ineffective jquery queries when i do such things as igcewieling. ;)
[14:44:51] <duch_kazatel> if that doesn't work, try something like $('#route_edit form .input.ui-state-error') or just $('#route_edit form .ui-state-error');
[14:45:37] <igcewieling> if I remove .id then console.log is printing a dump of the object.
[14:45:41] <hamiltonbeach> select a random element within the DOM. how can you figure out a what jquery selector can be used to uniquely describe that element? you do have the DOM object of this element
[14:46:18] <duch_kazatel> igcewieling does that element have an ID attribute?
[14:46:27] <duch_kazatel> hamiltonbeach depends.
[14:46:34] <duch_kazatel> hamiltonbeach if it has an ID, use that.
[14:46:39] <hamiltonbeach> not just a guess at what might be unique like an id or class tag or parentNode. has to actually be unique
[14:46:46] <hamiltonbeach> confirmed to be unique
[14:46:47] <duch_kazatel> trial and error I guess?
[14:46:50] <duch_kazatel> your question is odd.
[14:47:05] <hamiltonbeach> it is an odd question but i thought it was kind of a fun one
[14:47:14] <duch_kazatel> i'd probably use the xpath for it.
[14:47:47] <igcewieling> duch_kazatel: yes.  I can inspect the element and it has an id
[14:48:01] <igcewieling> I must be making some sort of stupid error, but I can't see it.
[14:48:31] <igcewieling> this is the inspected element: <input class="format_pattern fax ui-state-error" type="text" style="width:45.45em" id="route_edit_dnis_match" name="dnis_match" autocomplete="off" placeholder="">
[14:50:24] <duch_kazatel> igcewieling your selector won't match that.
[14:50:52] <igcewieling> what did I do wrong?
[14:51:03] <duch_kazatel> :inpu .ui-state-error
[14:51:09] <duch_kazatel> err, :input .ui-state-error
[14:51:17] <duch_kazatel> change that to just input.ui-state-error
[14:53:21] <igcewieling> oh!  I said I was a n00b 8-| Thanks duch_kazatel, I appreciate the help.
[14:58:57] <blue_warlock> who can tell me why this script not removing css attribs ?

[16:11:03] <FriendlySeal> and so do the ppl who say how awesom it is
[16:19:07] <Goopyo> is jquery xss safe?
[16:19:07] <Goopyo> I'm confused by this: <input id='yo' value='&lt;script&gt;' />
[16:19:07] <Goopyo> sorry meant this: http://jsfiddle.net/gkLuv/
[16:19:21] <Goopyo> it takes a escaped html sequence and it becomes raw text
[16:19:40] <Goopyo> are operations performed on that xss safe?
[16:19:46] <FriendlySeal> what lol
[16:20:10] <Goopyo> ?
[16:20:21] <FriendlySeal> use a condom
[16:20:23] <duch_kazatel> Goopyo you need to work on your server side to pretect against css.
[16:20:26] <duch_kazatel> *xss
[16:20:26] <shoky> document.getElementById('yo').value   would give you the same thing. jquery's not doing anything special
[16:20:48] <duch_kazatel> sanitize your inputs and outputs on the server.
[16:20:57] <Goopyo> duch more concerned about not persistent xss
[16:20:57] <FriendlySeal> exactly
[16:21:02] <Goopyo> i.e a url share
[16:21:37] <Goopyo> non-persistant xss*
[16:22:09] <duch_kazatel> i think you're confused about what that means.
[16:22:32] <duch_kazatel> validating and sanitizing inputs server-side will protect against non-persistent attacks.
[16:23:43] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: I prepared a fiddle and though it is not running in jsfiddle it runs on my system but weirdly it is giving me a repeat of all listed items http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/u3s76/
[16:24:25] <Goopyo> really? Like what if I share a url like faceboo.com?var=<script>alert('hey');</script>  and facebooks js reads var and adds it to the dom (doesn't touch the backend)
[16:24:57] <duch_kazatel> Goopyo wat.  you should never do that.
[16:25:07] <duch_kazatel> your code should never just take that data and just trust that it's good.
[16:25:44] <Goopyo> how else would you santize js only?
[16:25:45] <tongcx> hi guys, when i use $.get to get 'file.txt', it works, but for 'file.json', it doesn't work
[16:25:45] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda wat "it is giving me a repeat of all listen items"
[16:25:48] <FriendlySeal> Goopyo, xss is not for u
[16:25:50] <FriendlySeal> srsly
[16:25:51] <tongcx> why?
[16:25:54] <FriendlySeal> just stap
[16:26:07] <Goopyo> calm down homie
[16:26:18] <FriendlySeal> dumass
[16:26:19] <tongcx> hi guys, when i use $.get to get 'file.txt', it works, but for 'file.json', it doesn't work, why? The thing is that the callback is not called for '.json' case
[16:26:19] <duch_kazatel> Goopyo please name one case where you wopuld take content from the URL and just wholesale inject it into the page
[16:26:32] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: I am getting all the listed items twice. Let me make it into the fiddle and then show you
[16:26:46] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda i won't be able to deal with this right now sadly.
[16:26:56] <shoky> tongcx: it's probably trying to parse it as JSON , but it's not valid JSON
[16:27:09] <shoky> tongcx: getting any errors? add an error callback
[16:27:19] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda what I will tell you is that you've got each thing appending twice.
[16:27:30] <duch_kazatel> line 12 and 16.
[16:27:32] <Vivekananda> that is what is happening
[16:27:36] <duch_kazatel> and again on 19 and 24
[16:27:37] <shoky> tongcx: if you don't want it to parse it for you, use a dataType of 'text'
[16:27:41] <duch_kazatel> err, 19 and 23.
[16:27:52] <duch_kazatel> you're explicitly appending each thing twice.
[16:27:54] <tongcx> shoky: aha, thanks
[16:28:03] <Goopyo> duch_kazatel: take a search param, you use the get param sanitize it and put it in a input value. Then you're at the fiddle I posted if you want to do something like "You searched for" + input.val()
[16:28:06] <Vivekananda> I assumed that outer loops are accessed based on the flag
[16:28:44] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda huh?
[16:29:00] <Vivekananda> sorry
[16:29:05] <duch_kazatel> Goopyo your server should prepare all that content for you and create the popup appropriately.
[16:29:06] <Vivekananda> for 12 and 16
[16:29:30] <Goopyo> right but even if it escapes it jquery turns it back no? (at least thats what it seems like in the fiddle)
[16:29:33] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda right, if colorSchemeFlag ==  false AND item.type != currentCategory, you'll do both.
[16:29:34] <Vivekananda> I am appending item.type in 12 and item.label in 16. do they mean the same thing ?
[16:29:58] <duch_kazatel> Goopyo huh?  i'm saying that your code should not just spit content out back into the document.
[16:30:42] <Goopyo> but <script> became &lt;script&gt; on the backend, we set it to the input value, then doing input.val() brings it back to <script>
[16:31:10] <duch_kazatel> sure - that should not be a thing that causes problems.
[16:31:23] <Goopyo> cool that was my question
[16:31:38] <duch_kazatel> if you're taking text from the URL and injecting it as markup into the document, you're doing it wrong./
[16:31:40] <duch_kazatel> that's what I'm saying.
[16:32:05] <Vivekananda> I am appending item.type in 12 and item.label in 16. do they mean the same thing ?
[16:32:29] <Goopyo> But if you're taking text from the URL and injecting it as ESCAPED markup into the document and later using that value in more places through jquery I'm fine?
[16:32:49] <duch_kazatel> Goopyo you should never be injecting user input to the document, especialyl if it's in the URL.
[16:32:57] <Goopyo> even though it converts back to unescaped text
[16:33:08] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[16:33:28] <Goopyo> duch_kazatel: correct to me? Sorry making sure
[16:33:37] <sedeki_> how do I loop over class selectors? trying to do something like for (el in $('.several')) console.log(el); but it just lists the objects attributes
[16:33:41] <duch_kazatel> Goopyo think of it this way - if you're so unsure about how that exploit works, what makes you think you'll be able to sufficiently protect against it.
[16:33:50] <tongcx> shoky: it actually try to use .fail, but how do i retrieve the error info
[16:33:53] <Goopyo> I'm using django templates
[16:34:01] <shoky> Vivekananda is this what you wanted? http://jsfiddle.net/u3s76/2/
[16:34:18] <Goopyo> I'm just confused why django templates converts it to escaped JS then jquery processes back unescaped
[16:34:25] <Goopyo> escaped text*
[16:34:33] <shoky> tongcx: .fail(function(xhr, error, status) { console.log( error, status) })
[16:34:46] <duch_kazatel> sedeki_ half the time you don't need to loop over them.  the other falk you want $('.several')[el];, though the smarter way to go about it is to either use .each() or an array iterator.
[16:34:56] <tongcx> shoky: thanks
[16:34:57] <duch_kazatel> Goopyo that text is probably getting displayed	 correctly.
[16:35:06] <duch_kazatel> instead of getting converted.
[16:35:35] <duch_kazatel> Goopyo but still, sanitize in your backenbd.
[16:35:36] <duch_kazatel> *backend.
[16:35:48] <sedeki_> duch_kazatel each looks good, thanks
[16:35:53] <Vivekananda> yes shoky thanks a lot but you deleted the render line itself ..
[16:36:16] <shoky> Vivekananda yes because you're rendering it yourself.. or so i thought you wanted to do
[16:36:54] <Vivekananda> yes I did want that was just not sure that render was not needed to be called coz I did not knowwhat that render line was doing exactly
[16:37:04] <shoky> well, put it back in and see
[16:38:29] <Vivekananda> yes I see what happens but also the problem is the after removing it the rendered items are no more clickable :(
[16:38:47] <Vivekananda> now I guess will have to write a click function for each too is it ?
[16:39:14] <Vivekananda> all I wanted was to just change the font color of the items below the category
[16:41:10] <FriendlySeal> lol
[16:41:33] <FriendlySeal> Vivekananda, take a look at backbone.js
[16:41:53] <duch_kazatel> what Vivekananda really needs is to understand how to write javascript and jquery.
[16:41:55] <duch_kazatel> *use jquery
[16:42:03] <FriendlySeal> yes it uses it too
[16:42:11] <FriendlySeal> but it provides u w some structure
[16:44:09] <duch_kazatel> i'd say given what they're trying to do AND their presumed skill level, backbone might be a little overkill.
[16:44:28] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: the last problem you told me of was not actually a problem of my code ( as shok y demonstrated). I was not adding the same line twice there
[16:44:37] <duch_kazatel> kay
[16:44:42] <duch_kazatel> i was taking a stab in the dark.
[16:48:19] <FriendlySeal> duch_kazatel, yes but time invested now will solve a lot of problems
[16:48:27] <FriendlySeal> for a long time
[16:50:17] <FriendlySeal> i duno
[16:50:35] <FriendlySeal> btw false alarm on moment
[16:50:41] <FriendlySeal> my fault lool
[16:50:48] <FriendlySeal> <- nub
[16:55:31] <shoky> Vivekananda: cleaned it up for you and made it clickable  http://jsfiddle.net/u3s76/3/
[16:55:57] <shoky> Vivekananda: now it's a full replacement for the _renderItemData call
[16:56:29] <FriendlySeal> var that lol
[16:56:35] <FriendlySeal> its var self;
[16:56:44] <FriendlySeal> lisen to larry wall gah
[16:56:51] <duch_kazatel> FriendlySeal sure, but you'll dump them into a world they won't be able to really understand.
[16:57:11] <FriendlySeal> well
[16:57:20] <FriendlySeal> ive been programing for a while
[16:57:23] <duch_kazatel> and they'll be over in #documentcloud asking for backbone code snippets.
[16:57:39] <duch_kazatel> without understanding the underlying language.
[16:57:41] <FriendlySeal> and its seems like only now im starting to think this way
[16:57:44] <FriendlySeal> start small
[16:57:48] <FriendlySeal> keep it small
[16:57:58] <FriendlySeal> until u perfect the structure
[16:58:04] <FriendlySeal> or architecture
[16:58:31] <FriendlySeal> coz ive wasted so many friken years building up stuff and it just not holding up
[16:58:45] <duch_kazatel> I'd argue that you should start with javascript, maybe a little jquery, but avoid getting into MV* frameworks until you have a firm grasp on what the language is doing and what problem they solve.
[16:58:56] <FriendlySeal> yes yes
[16:59:04] <FriendlySeal> but jquery isnt exactly that either
[16:59:32] <duch_kazatel> sure - that's why I say "maybe a little jQuery".
[16:59:34] <shoky> he did say "maybe a little jquery"
[16:59:34] <duch_kazatel> but meh.
[16:59:37] <shoky> hah
[16:59:43] <duch_kazatel> haha shoky++
[16:59:54] <FriendlySeal> im just trying to be smart tho
[16:59:57] <duch_kazatel> at the end of the day, it really depends on your goals, needs, desires, etc.
[17:00:15] <FriendlySeal> im the first one to say code as fast and dirty as posible
[17:00:23] <FriendlySeal> while creativity is flowing
[17:00:26] <FriendlySeal> and clean up later
[17:00:29] <shoky> you seem like the first one to say lots of stuff
[17:00:46] <FriendlySeal> dats coz i dun have any questions for u
[17:00:47] <FriendlySeal> lol
[17:01:05] <FriendlySeal> i can code anything i feel like coding up
[17:01:17] <duch_kazatel> if I just dropped in backbone anywhere in the application I'm currently working in, I'd probably get reamed for it.
[17:01:25] <FriendlySeal> so i mainly talk about architectures
[17:02:16] <FriendlySeal> im kind of  the bigest fan of killing all birds w 1 stone
[17:02:36] <duch_kazatel> you apart of a bigger team?
[17:02:39] <duch_kazatel> or a smaller shop?
[17:02:40] <FriendlySeal> so i try to design a arch that can render anything w one thing
[17:02:55] <FriendlySeal> smaller
[17:03:00] * shoky sighs
[17:03:13] <FriendlySeal> my last work had about 10 coders
[17:03:14] <duch_kazatel> yeah coupling all your logic like that's going to bite you in the ass later.
[17:03:20] <FriendlySeal> which i thot was big
[17:03:31] <FriendlySeal> but it seemed like those guys werent geting shit done
[17:03:39] <FriendlySeal> like at all
[17:04:00] <FriendlySeal> months wud go by and im like
[17:04:07] <FriendlySeal> so how r u gona handle paging?
[17:04:15] <FriendlySeal> and hes like paging?
[17:04:22] <FriendlySeal> im like r u fkn joking me
[17:04:40] <FriendlySeal> u toodled on this for 6months and have no pager
[17:05:01] <FriendlySeal> he is like but r u using twiter bootsrap
[17:05:27] <FriendlySeal> im like `\_o_/`
[17:05:49] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:05:52] <FriendlySeal> fuker bootstrap btw takes away all ur css creativity
[17:05:55] <duch_kazatel> i can't understand the last few lines.
[17:06:01] <shoky> hahaha
[17:06:07] <FriendlySeal> which ?
[17:06:31] <FriendlySeal> where they made the stupid project use someones css themes
[17:06:32] <duch_kazatel> you were just saying "use frameworks and libraries because they make shit go faster" and now you're saying "don't use frameworks and libraries because they take away your creativity".
[17:06:44] <FriendlySeal> but didnt have any idea how to page the data
[17:06:56] <FriendlySeal> well
[17:07:14] <FriendlySeal> css is not code
[17:07:25] <FriendlySeal> its looks
[17:07:52] <FriendlySeal> also if u gona go that route w code too im all for designing ur own framworks
[17:07:58] <FriendlySeal> i have one in php and python
[17:08:59] <duch_kazatel> what kind of industry are you in?
[17:09:01] <duch_kazatel> like, ecommerce?
[17:09:06] <FriendlySeal> yes
[17:09:11] <duch_kazatel> that is terrifying.
[17:09:18] <FriendlySeal> ya lol
[17:09:27] <duch_kazatel> your approach scares me.
[17:09:32] <FriendlySeal> why?
[17:09:48] <duch_kazatel> i'm in ecommerce
[17:09:54] <duch_kazatel> if we did things that way, we'd get destroyed.
[17:09:55] <FriendlySeal> isnt every1
[17:10:02] <FriendlySeal> what do u mean
[17:10:36] <duch_kazatel> big monolithic javascript applications with all their logic tied into one file?
[17:10:40] <duch_kazatel> that's terrifying to me.
[17:10:59] <FriendlySeal> hahaha no
[17:11:18] <FriendlySeal> btw its all magento
[17:11:22] <FriendlySeal> lol
[17:11:34] <FriendlySeal> i have my own shop but i aint giving it to my work
[17:11:35] <duch_kazatel> oh god you poor bastard.
[17:11:46] <duch_kazatel> we abandoned that a while ago for a one-off project.
[17:12:03] <FriendlySeal> dood its work
[17:12:20] <FriendlySeal> i aint giving any of my code to work
[17:12:26] <FriendlySeal> fuk those chumps
[17:12:40] <FriendlySeal> they can stew their own noodles
[17:12:46] <duch_kazatel> sorry you hate your employer then?
[17:12:47] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:12:50] <FriendlySeal> i dont
[17:13:00] <FriendlySeal> imjus not sharing my code
[17:13:20] <FriendlySeal> btw i dev on linux
[17:13:24] <FriendlySeal> complete foss
[17:13:38] <duch_kazatel> grats?
[17:13:51] <FriendlySeal> no jus saying that im kinda greedy
[17:14:05] <FriendlySeal> u kno using all opensource stuff but closing mine
[17:15:11] <duch_kazatel> meh.  depending on what you're doing that's fine.
[17:16:40] <FriendlySeal> what r u using instaead of magento
[17:17:02] <duch_kazatel> a fully homegrown solution that, for all its warts and funk, is actually pretty solid.
[17:17:11] <FriendlySeal> no its great
[17:17:14] <duch_kazatel> we need more than what magento offers.
[17:17:21] <FriendlySeal> yep
[17:17:30] <FriendlySeal> i member wen magento didnt have paypal
[17:17:32] <FriendlySeal> but mine did
[17:39:01] <rainabba> Best way to select elements using data-id value?
[17:40:48] <rainabba> hm, nm
[17:52:20] <mdev> trying to use a this.mymethod inside of a .done for a $.post
[17:52:28] <mdev> says the mymethod isn't defined, any ideas
[17:52:48] <mdev> actually i'll just post code example in a few minutes
[17:52:59] <systemfault> mdev: Scoping issue.
[17:53:08] <mdev> system how to fix?
[17:53:28] <mdev> I could do myclass.method I guess
[17:53:37] <mdev> but not sure if that'd be clean/correct way
[17:54:00] <mdev> yeah that makes it work
[17:54:02] <systemfault> mdev: The easiest is to capture the outer scope's "this" by doing something like : "var that = this;" and then inside the handler, that.method instead of this.method
[17:54:41] <systemfault> Another way is to use $.proxy... to set the "this"
[17:55:36] <mdev> ahh ok, thanks i'll try that
[17:55:41] <mdev> you're clever
[17:59:32] <mdev> yeah the that this works nicely, awesome
[17:59:36] <mdev> thanks+
[18:02:51] <jsharpminor> if($("#" + itemID).is(":checked")) seems to always return true
[18:02:59] <jsharpminor> What's wrong with that syntax?
[18:03:14] <FriendlySeal> ah ya
[18:03:16] <FriendlySeal> okay
[18:03:19] <FriendlySeal> use prop
[18:03:23] <FriendlySeal> leme find it
[18:03:40] <FriendlySeal> $(element).prop("checked", !$(element).prop("checked"));
[18:04:34] <jsharpminor> if($(itemID).prop("checked")){ //stuff } ?
[18:04:52] <jsharpminor> I don't get what the line you just posted would do
[18:04:58] <jsharpminor> So pardon my ignorance
[18:05:00] <jsharpminor> please
[18:05:41] <jsharpminor> I did go to jquery.com/prop/ btw
[18:05:42] <michaud> Question: I have a basic "click" filter list developed with jQuery http://jsfiddle.net/michaud/8aLCu/ ... tried to do the same with jQuery Mobile (with a tap) and the list disappears http://jsfiddle.net/michaud/YLd3C/ ... Not sure what I'm overlooking.
[18:08:18] <FriendlySeal> jsharpminor, yes
[18:08:48] <FriendlySeal> that flips the checkbox
[18:09:05] <FriendlySeal> var lol = $(element).prop("checked")
[18:09:20] <Vivekananda> hey everyone. What is a good alternative to jira for opensource with all the bells and whistles
[18:09:48] <FriendlySeal> trac
[18:23:50] <systemfault> Ew.
[18:24:05] <systemfault> Trac is like a bad joke compared to jira.
[18:24:14] <systemfault> Just pay for it.
[18:24:16] <systemfault> (Jira)
[18:26:57] <pera> Hi. I'm using a carousel library that let you set a function that is called before every animation starts. I would like to use fadeTo() inside this callback, but also I would like to wait until it finish...
[18:27:44] <FriendlySeal> jira is a pile
[18:28:03] <pera> I think is not possible without changing the lib, am I correct?
[18:28:25] <mdev> google probably your best bet here to see if there's a way to detect when it's finished loading
[18:28:43] <mdev> or a caveman way is to just do a settimeout then call your fadeto :)
[18:28:44] <pera> mdev: I am not asking that
[18:29:03] <pera> I know I can set a callback...
[18:29:19] <mdev> ok what's the problem? animate done call a callback?
[18:29:32] <pera> I don't have control of the animation
[18:29:38] <pera> that's part of the lib
[18:29:46] <pera> *control over
[18:30:36] <pera> the only thing I can do is create a function that is called before every animation
[18:30:38] <mdev> it doesn't let you specify a onfinished type callback?
[18:31:02] <pera> yes...
[18:31:11] <pera> but
[18:31:17] <pera> how would that help?
[18:32:00] <pera> I mean, there is a beforeStart and afterEnd
[18:32:00] <mdev> you want to detect when the animation finishes right?
[18:32:11] <pera> oh no
[18:32:19] <pera> I want to control when the animation starts :)
[18:32:49] <pera> I think this would go against async programming, but maybe I am wrong
[18:32:58] <mdev> so i'm assuming ti automatically starts when you initalize the library?
[18:33:20] <mdev> i'm sure it probably lets you specify something to disable animation and/or then call it manual later
[18:33:25] <mdev> *manually
[18:33:52] <pera> mmm at least I can't find it in the docs :P
[18:34:15] <pera> this is the library https://github.com/kswedberg/jquery-carousel-lite
[18:35:06] <park> can someone sugest me some good ajax based(autocomplete) search box plugin
[18:35:45] <mdev> look at auto: true,
[18:35:53] <mdev> set that to false
[18:36:48] <mdev> then looks like the go method lets you do it manual
[18:36:58] <mdev> go event rather
[18:37:14] <pera> (auto scroll is false by default)
[18:37:54] <mdev> yeah I don't then brother
[18:37:59] <mdev> sure someone in here can help
[18:38:24] <pera> mdev: ok :) thank you anyway
[18:38:53] <mdev> yeah sorry couldn't be of any help
[18:39:20] <pera> maybe I could add a promise
[18:46:25] <pera> (or maybe I should use another lib...)
[19:01:41] <abetusk> var objA = { data: ['foo', 'bar'] };  var objB = { data: [] };  $.extend(true, objA, objB); console.log(objA.data); ----> ["foo", "bar"]
[19:01:48] <abetusk> is this a bug or is this expected behavior?
[19:07:56] <blue_warlock> oi
[19:07:59] <blue_warlock> whos on ?
[19:08:00] <blue_warlock> =)
[19:11:53] <blue_warlock> i want to call a function i ve written on doc open , and on win resize

[19:14:43] <FriendlySeal> lol
[19:15:20] <gordian> and you'll then need to add another call to checking() outside of .resize()
[19:15:54] <blue_warlock> hum
[19:16:00] <blue_warlock> yea
[19:16:05] <blue_warlock> but what was wrong

[21:25:47] <vinex08> Hi! my theme is using bootstrap accordion-toggle ... Issue: I dont want the first 'li' to load automatically when page is loaded.... here's the code http://jsfiddle.net/u8Ert/
[21:25:48] <lenswipe> TheAncientGoat, I'm trying to get it to wrap the message in <p> (and optionally <em>) tags
[21:26:14] <lenswipe> vinex08, define "load automatically"
[21:26:31] <vinex08> i mean, expands automatically...
[21:26:31] <lenswipe> you mean be visible or do you mean be in the page at all?
[21:26:39] <lenswipe> vinex08, so remove the open class
[21:26:59] <lenswipe> vinex08, that's not your complete code, post the HTMLwith it
[21:27:01] <vinex08> so it's in there somewhere..
[21:27:23] <vinex08> it's wordpress i have to dig the files,, and look for the toggle thing
[21:28:17] <lenswipe> vinex08, yeah remove the class "in" and it wont be expanded anymore
[21:28:26] <lenswipe>   <div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse in"> from there
[21:28:38] <vinex08> thanks!!
[21:29:09] <lenswipe> np
[21:29:18] <Vivekananda> hey everyone
[21:29:33] <lenswipe> vinex08, incidentally it's worth noting that this is #jquery not #bootstrap
[21:29:35] <Vivekananda> anyone here who could take a swipe at a question
[21:29:45] <lenswipe> Vivekananda, Ill give it a stab
[21:29:48] <lenswipe> hit me
[21:30:06] <Vivekananda> I have two questions and I am learning jquery and not good so please bear with me
[21:32:07] <lenswipe> ... so ask
[21:32:33] <Vivekananda> The first question --- the source code http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp  here uses json as the response data but parses it to get values in lines 37 and 38. I created a json response with has the same structure as the parsed structure but I cannot use the word "data" as response still !
[21:32:35] <Vivekananda> why not
[21:34:08] <blue_warlock> hi
[21:34:12] <blue_warlock> someone on ?
[21:34:19] <firebalrog> yes
[21:34:27] <blue_warlock> hey hi
[21:34:29] <blue_warlock> =)
[21:34:29] <firebalrog> just ask your question
[21:34:46] <Vivekananda> did the question make sense ?
[21:34:53] <Vivekananda> I have two more to go.
[21:35:20] <blue_warlock> i have 2 divs one with float left and the other with float right
[21:36:04] <blue_warlock> if i resize window the float right goes up to the float left
[21:36:05] <lenswipe> Vivekananda, I dont think I can help you
[21:36:08] <lenswipe> sorry
[21:36:09] <lenswipe> :(
[21:36:30] <Vivekananda> np :)
[21:36:31] <blue_warlock> hm wait i make a fiddle
[21:36:41] <Vivekananda> lenswipe: I have other questions
[21:36:49] <lenswipe> so ask them
[21:36:50] <Vivekananda> perhaps you can help me with my third question
[21:38:55] <Vivekananda> third -- I have created a readahead dropdown. When an item is clicked it is put up in the text box. I want that whenever a new value is put in the box a hidden box shows up and gets some values
[21:39:10] <Vivekananda> I want it to look a little suave so how to do this ?
[21:39:32] <Vivekananda> what jquery/other  widget to use ?
[21:39:34] <lenswipe> i don't know what suave means
[21:39:49] <lenswipe> I mean
[21:39:53] <lenswipe> I know what it means but not in this context
[21:39:57] <lenswipe> I'm also going to bed soon
[21:40:19] <Vivekananda> like good to look at. somthing with a little animation when the shape is formed
[21:40:23] <Vivekananda> that sort of thing
[21:40:25] <blue_warlock> look firebalrog http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/KdqFw/4/
[21:41:12] <blue_warlock> when i resize the window i want the div main resizes keeping the the div with float right on the right, till the min.width comes
[21:41:35] <blue_warlock> hes the div dxbox goes up
[21:42:11] <blue_warlock> enlarge a bit the result screen
[21:42:15] <Error404NotFound> If i change a radio button using JQ, does the click event still get fired? I don't think so unless one manually raises it.
[21:42:28] <blue_warlock> till the divs are near each other
[21:44:18] <blue_warlock> somebody knows why the main div goes immediatelly down ?
[21:44:30] <firebalrog> use 66%,33%
[21:44:48] <blue_warlock> in that way they stands always near each other
[21:44:57] <firebalrog> ya
[21:45:21] <firebalrog> or make one fixed and the other 100%
[21:45:27] <blue_warlock> but i need , the main goes down when it reaches the min-width
[21:45:32] <firebalrog> surround in another div
[21:46:56] <firebalrog> use different layout for smaller screens see responsive design. Good choice would be skeleton, bootstrap, or foundation
[21:47:31] <blue_warlock> its what i need
[21:47:37] <blue_warlock> must be responsive
[21:48:32] <TheAncientGoat> lenswipe: sorry had to answer a call
[21:48:36] <lenswipe> np
[21:50:28] <blue_warlock> does skeleton uses jquery ?
[21:51:08] <Vivekananda> lenswipe: no tips ?
[21:51:46] <lenswipe> can't think of any
[21:51:47] <lenswipe> sorry
[21:52:13] <TheAncientGoat> lenswipe: got your solution
[21:52:26] <lenswipe> :)
[21:52:27] <lenswipe> oh?
[21:53:41] <TheAncientGoat> lenswipe: http://plnkr.co/edit/scOUdsPvQ15N2QYMzKhK?p=preview
[21:53:50] <TheAncientGoat> that's how I do my jquery element creation
[21:53:50] <firebalrog> skeleton can work with jquery
[21:54:15] <lenswipe> thank you
[21:55:02] <TheAncientGoat> sorry I took so long. Was actually conducting a technical interview.. Guy had trouble doing fizzbuzz
[21:55:11] <Vivekananda> anyone else care to take a swing at my question ?
[21:56:05] * FriendlySeal swings Vivekananda 
[21:56:27] <Vivekananda> he source code http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp  here uses json as the response data but parses it to get values in lines 37 and 38. I created a json response with has the same structure as the parsed structure but I cannot use the word "data" as response still ! why not ?
[21:56:48] <FriendlySeal> omfg
[21:56:54] <FriendlySeal> im a jenius
[21:57:00] <TheAncientGoat> Vivekananda: if you can give an example of your broken code, it is easier to helop
[21:57:03] <TheAncientGoat> er help
[21:57:10] <FriendlySeal> I DID IT BOYS
[21:59:05] <FriendlySeal> once again regained leader status
[21:59:28] <FriendlySeal> i kno it hurts u gaize to see me shine
[21:59:36] <TheAncientGoat> Vivekananda: preferably in a runnable state on http://plnkr.co/edit/
[22:03:34] <Vivekananda> TheAncientGoat: okay sure here  http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/hx72G/25/ . lines 105 and 131 are both good and run locally. I am referring to line 120 121 122 and replacing all these with  just the word : return data;
[22:04:13] <blue_warlock> ty guys
[22:04:36] <blue_warlock> gnight
[22:04:37] <Vivekananda> here the variable results is very same to the variable retunred as a .get request ie the "data" variable
[22:04:40] <Vivekananda> blue_warlock: gn
[22:04:59] * blue_warlock =)
[22:05:35] <FriendlySeal> nice ur making autocomplete
[22:05:45] <FriendlySeal> i did that
[22:06:41] <FriendlySeal> snaks lol
[22:10:37] <Vivekananda> FriendlySeal: lol
[22:10:49] <Vivekananda> yes but that was just a placeholder for an actual example
[22:11:15] <FriendlySeal> i beliv u
[22:11:45] <Vivekananda> I am hoping for some insight into the "data" being returned and why it is insufficient and gives an error but it does not if I just remap it
[22:11:51] <Vivekananda> but to the same structure
[22:13:09] <FriendlySeal> r u going to use ajax?
[22:13:19] <FriendlySeal> thats wat complete does
[22:13:41] <Vivekananda> complete ?
[22:13:45] <FriendlySeal> but u already did the hardpart
[22:13:56] <Vivekananda> yes I am using ajax as is shown in the fiddle
[22:14:04] <FriendlySeal> oh
[22:14:24] <FriendlySeal> oh ya lol
[22:22:22] <TheAncientGoat> Vivekananda: checking it now
[22:37:07] <Guest35951> Vivekananda: It works fine if you only return data..
[22:38:16] <Guest35951> Vivekananda: http://jsfiddle.net/4sfd6/1/
[22:40:53] <jsharpminor> Did the channel just burp?
[23:28:51] <hiby007> hello i am running this code in console works fine
[23:28:51] <hiby007> http://pastebin.com/23a8nXkm
[23:29:05] <hiby007> but when i run from bookmarklet there is an error
[23:29:14] <hiby007> Uncaught ReferenceError: pageScroll is not defined
[23:29:48] <hiby007> when trying to execute function.
[23:29:56] <Cork> hiby007: 1. you should ask that in ##javascript
[23:30:10] <Cork> 2. you try to access the functions as if they where globals
[23:30:16] <Cork> and from a booklet it isn't
[23:30:29] <hiby007> ok, what should i do in that case?
[23:30:31] <Cork> hiby007: try moving the js out of the html
[23:30:48] <Cork> and use event listeners instead of event attributes
[23:31:16] <hiby007> ok, let me try and sorry for posting here
[23:31:40] <hiby007> didn't knew javascript questions are not allowed here.
