[00:35:50] <al-damiri> Hi #jquery.
[00:37:12] <al-damiri> I have an element like <i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-down"></i> and I'm doing this .find("*[class~='fa-chevron-circle']") but this returns nothing.
[00:37:26] <al-damiri> if I do .find('i') it returns all the <i>s.
[00:38:04] <al-damiri> I want to select all <i>s which have a class starting with fa-chevron-circle (it may have other classes though.)
[00:38:28] <rcyr> al-damiri: How would you do it with CSS?
[00:38:37] <al-damiri> rcyr: I don't know.
[00:38:57] <rcyr> i.fa-chevron-circle but... please, learn CSS
[00:39:14] <rcyr> There's no reason to learn JS and jQuery if you don't know CSS>
[00:39:18] <Kartagis> al-damiri: $("i.fa-chevron-circle")
[00:39:58] <al-damiri> Kartagis, rcyr: This still returns nothing.
[00:40:22] <Kartagis> rcyr: there are debates around killing CSS and continuing with jquery
[00:40:32] <Kartagis> stupid discussion
[00:40:44] <al-damiri> The full class name is either fa-chevron-circle-down or fa-chevron-circle-up.
[00:41:15] <al-damiri> So I want to select all <i>s if it has a class starting with 'fa-chevron-circle'.
[00:43:04] <al-damiri> ?
[00:43:49] <Cork> al-damiri: you shouldn't ever select on partial classes
[00:43:57] <Cork> add a separate class for that
[00:44:05] <Cork> and make a clean selector
[00:44:23] <al-damiri> Cork: Okay I shall make the changes then.
[00:44:36] <al-damiri> Cork: The question still remains, is it possible, if so how :) ?
[00:44:43] <Cork> no you can't
[00:44:47] <al-damiri> Cork: I see.
[00:44:53] <Cork> you can select on text in an attribute called "class"
[00:44:58] <Cork> but it isn't a class selector
[00:45:06] <Cork> (so it is MUCH slower)
[00:45:25] <Cork> $('[class*=""]') <-- never ever do this
[00:46:20] <Cork> al-damiri: the reason you can't select on partial classes is cause element supports multiple classes
[00:46:26] <Cork> and that is how you are meant to do it
[00:49:04] <al-damiri> Cork: Thanks, that makes thing much clearer.
[00:50:27] <Uhkis> Cork: isn't that the same as $('[class]') ?
[00:50:45] <Cork> Uhkis: well "" wasn't mean to be left empty,,,
[00:50:48] <Uhkis> or does the anything make it so much slower?
[00:51:19] <Cork> but ya any [] is slower then class selectors
[00:51:33] <Cork> and any [anything="anything"] makes it additionally slower
[00:52:00] <Cork> [] means the browser has to select all elements and then loop each element to check for the attribute child of that element
[00:52:03] <Uhkis> too bad there's no data- selector
[00:52:35] <Cork> [attr=""] means an additional loop each attribute to check for the string is/starts with/endswith/contains the string
[00:52:38] <sopparus> hey, if anyone mind looking at this short snip http://pastebin.com/p48rbQXP, how can I pass z1 down to the addClass line?
[00:53:04] <Cork> sopparus: that code makes no sense
[00:53:17] <Cork> why do you have $(function() {}) inside a function you're calling?
[00:53:41] <sopparus> dont know.. :)
[00:53:44] <Uhkis> ?api ready
[00:53:44] <b-ot> Uhkis: .ready(): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[00:54:11] <sopparus> how else would I call it?
[00:54:20] <Uhkis> and that second function on the ready() prolly wont run either
[00:55:42] <sopparus> it does
[00:55:57] <sopparus> if you set var z1 = "01" manually
[00:56:40] <Cork> sopparus: $(function() {}) is a function call that is meant to "wait until the document is stable"
[00:56:53] <Cork> it ever only makes sense if it is called on page load directly
[00:57:10] <Cork> the rest makes sense to be defined inside it, not outside
[00:58:02] <Cork> sopparus: http://pastebin.com/x5q2jJKM
[00:58:18] <Cork> ah, right
[00:58:26] <Cork> and the .ready you have there doesn't make sense eother
[00:58:43] <Bjerre> Uhkis: are you awake?
[00:58:50] <Uhkis> Bjerre: somewhat
[00:58:54] <Bjerre> haha great
[00:58:56] <Cork> sopparus: what is the .ready meant to do there?
[00:59:12] <Bjerre> I found out a problem with the code you pasted yesterday. It will only change to the language that is on the first button
[00:59:28] <Bjerre> so if you're on button 2 then it should show the swedish text for button 2
[00:59:34] <Uhkis> Bjerre: thought as much after i went afk :D
[00:59:36] <Bjerre> but now it shows swedish text for button 1
[00:59:48] <Uhkis> but i was too tired to come back and fix it
[01:00:06] <Bjerre> haha I see mate :) I went afk as well, if you call afk bed :)
[01:00:18] <DarsVaeda> is it a bug that beforeShow of datepicker does not provide the correct date on initial request: http://jsfiddle.net/b5nzu9rw/
[01:00:19] <Uhkis> yes, my new ikea bed! :D
[01:00:24] <Bjerre> :D
[01:00:27] <Bjerre> it's huge!
[01:00:31] <DarsVaeda> and what is the difference between current and selected dates?
[01:00:34] <sopparus> Cork, just to activate it when it runs, it was hover on the example I started with
[01:00:46] <Cork> when what runs?
[01:00:55] <Bjerre> king size bed with blue and yellow colors
[01:00:56] <sopparus> that pastebin didnt work btw
[01:01:07] <Cork> ya, cause the ready doesn't make sense
[01:01:07] <sopparus> When I call this funcition
[01:01:14] <Cork> uh...
[01:01:21] <Cork> i don't get it
[01:01:35] <Cork> you call $('table tr').ready with two functions
[01:01:46] <Cork> and firstly jquery doesn't provide anything like this
[01:01:52] <Uhkis> Bjerre: so where's the fiddle again?
[01:01:53] <Cork> and i can't really make sense what you're trying to do
[01:01:59] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/67/ Uhkis
[01:02:11] <Cork> *of what you're
[01:02:18] <sopparus> I would like to if, possible. When some code has run, make this code highlight a table, if possible highlight(z1) for example
[01:02:34] <Cork> ok simple
[01:02:40] <Bjerre> add class or border line color
[01:02:40] <Cork> what is the second function mean to do?
[01:03:04] <sopparus> the one who removes the highlight?
[01:03:19] <Cork> the one that has the removeClass call yes
[01:03:26] <Cork> when is it meant to run?
[01:03:48] <sopparus> it should be another call, yes. I havent gotten that far yet
[01:03:57] <Cork> another call??
[01:04:03] <Cork> what is meant to trigger the second case?
[01:04:18] <sopparus> some other code, so I can do removehighlight(z1)
[01:04:18] <Cork> if table tr" doesn't exist?
[01:04:26] <sopparus> no, I always know the line
[01:04:35] <Cork> so... again
[01:04:39] <Cork> what is ready meant to do?
[01:04:54] <Cork> or rather what do you want to happen when you write the ready call with two functions
[01:05:21] <sopparus> i changd to ready from hover so it would always run without doing anything, maybe its not the best way :)
[01:05:45] <Cork> sopparus: is this what you mean? http://pastebin.com/5iFEZEZ1
[01:05:57] <Cork> cause again the code you have makes no sense
[01:06:25] <Bjerre> lameee
[01:06:45] <Cork> sopparus: if it doesn't work, create a more complete jsfiddle.new
[01:06:50] <Cork> jsfiddle.net
[01:06:58] <Bjerre> !paste
[01:06:58] <b-ot> Bjerre: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:07:05] <Cork> with the html and js this is meant to work with
[01:07:24] <Bjerre> you're up early Cork
[01:07:31] <Cork> not really
[01:07:37] <sopparus> Cork, https://jsfiddle.net/3k0suvL1/
[01:07:40] <sopparus> it doesnt run
[01:08:12] <Bjerre> you need an on.('click')
[01:08:18] <Bjerre> or something
[01:08:23] <Bjerre> you have nothing to start it with
[01:08:28] <Cork> ah
[01:08:36] <Cork> sopparus: 01 != "01"
[01:08:37] <sopparus> thats why I found the .ready
[01:08:40] <Cork> sopparus: 01 == "1"
[01:08:54] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/3k0suvL1/1/
[01:09:34] <Cork> js> print((01).toString())
[01:09:37] <b-ot> Cork: 1
[01:10:03] <sopparus> ah cool
[01:10:16] <sopparus> can I later run .removeClass on that then?
[01:10:29] <Cork> just call the function again
[01:10:33] <Cork> it will toggle the class
[01:10:54] <sopparus> ah awesome
[01:10:55] <sopparus> thanks
[01:11:04] <Cork> sopparus: https://jsfiddle.net/3k0suvL1/2/
[01:12:29] <sopparus> yeah great
[01:12:38] <dnano91> hi, is it better to insert/delete a tag or have it there from the beginning and add/remove a class? it's in a table and can happen once for every element
[01:12:47] <sopparus> gonna see if I can get it to work with the real stuff
[01:12:58] <Cork> dnano91: depends on the situation
[01:13:18] <Cork> dnano91: if it isn't too many elements or the show/hide often
[01:13:29] <dnano91> Cork: a table and in one column there is a load button, that only activates once
[01:13:32] <Cork> then keeping it in the page makes sense
[01:13:38] <dnano91> it's there for every element
[01:13:52] <Cork> if you have tone of them, or they are rarely shown
[01:14:02] <Cork> then ya adding them as you need them makes sense for performance
[01:14:36] <dnano91> okay. then a follow up: how can i insert a tag and get a reference so i can delete it later?
[01:15:02] <Cork> dnano91: basically its a memory/dom speed vs js gc speed
[01:15:16] <Cork> *js/gc speed
[01:15:28] <Cork> dnano91: well you can store a reference to it
[01:15:31] <Cork> or give it an id
[01:15:31] <Bjerre> I just found out for myself that tables are stretching even if you set a width :E
[01:15:52] <Cork> Bjerre: you can't muster them to not do it
[01:15:56] <Cork> but ya, it is a fight
[01:16:11] <Bjerre> that's why I don't use tables
[01:16:16] <Bjerre> from now on
[01:16:29] <Cork> it makes sense to use them for table data
[01:16:35] <Bjerre> true
[01:16:45] <Cork> but ya you shouldn't use it for anything else
[01:17:02] <Cork> especially now when flex is actually quite usable
[01:17:02] <Uhkis> Bjerre: http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/68/
[01:17:20] <Bjerre> my man Uhkis
[01:18:13] <Bjerre> that's exactly what I was looking for. Thank you so much, you're the best
[01:18:55] <Bjerre> line 1 to 27 is what's new right Uhkis?
[01:19:03] <Uhkis> after you got it fully working, you probably need to rewrite the whole thing ;D
[01:19:16] <Bjerre> nooo :(
[01:19:29] <Bjerre> optimizing is a bitch
[01:19:36] <Bjerre> if it works it works :)
[01:19:42] <Bjerre> at least for now
[01:20:16] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/69/ cleaned it up a bit, 5-19 is new iirc
[01:21:23] <Bjerre> textlang = 'en' does nothing right?
[01:21:25] <Bjerre> so I can remove it?
[01:22:03] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/70/
[01:22:14] <Bjerre> nice Uhkis thanks for the cleaning :)
[01:33:55] <BeerLover> can someone tell me how to store cookie in this login page?
[01:33:56] <BeerLover> https://gist.github.com/abhyuditjain/0f4e15bfb6d537dd8c0c
[01:34:04] <BeerLover> I'm not able to stoe cookie
[01:43:10] <Bjerre> fantastic work Uhkis
[01:43:34] <Bjerre> I reorganized it a bit to make some things global and not since it's a SPA with many scenes
[01:43:37] <Bjerre> but it works great
[01:46:43] <Bjerre> lines 85-93 http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/73/  I added arrow up to toggle the language button. Is it possible to make it only trigger once per second and not make it possible to hold down arrow up to change the language endless of times?
[01:47:19] <Cork> Bjerre: change keydown to keyup
[01:47:32] <Cork> else ya, you would have to use a setTimeout to solve that
[01:47:32] <Bjerre> smart
[01:48:10] <Bjerre> yea that resolves it
[01:48:11] <Bjerre> ty
[01:49:47] <Bjerre> I'm so glad it's working now. Awesome people around here. I wish I had the knowledge of helping others like you've helped me but I've learned a lot lately thanks to you guys. If there is any basic questions I'm gladly to help out

[02:05:12] <Bjerre> damn summer :E
[02:07:26] <Dulcin> Hi, not really a jQuery problem, but I'm hoping someone has had a similar problem. I'm using jQuery AJAX get requests, using relative URLs (no scheme/domain). My webserver runs on SSL and everything works fine, except that Chrome seems to block the XHR (Security Error, mixed content), because even though the request is done over HTTPS, the response is over HTTP, while my response header on the
[02:07:26] <Dulcin> server is also relative. I am able to fix it by hardcoding my response URL but this seems like a bad solution to this problem.
[02:08:16] <Dulcin> Has anyone had this problem or know a solution to this?
[02:25:26] <kokut> Hi, i have a hover event in a class, how can i get the index of that element in the selection ?
[02:27:33] <kokut> nvm
[02:29:38] <Cork> kokut: $(this).index()
[02:30:31] <kokut> Hi Cork, jQuery('.class-name').length = 16, its 4x4 grid with 4 rows and 4 cols each, and when i do jQuery('.class-name').hover(....$(this).index() it shows a number from 0-4, i need the whole set, from 0-16
[02:31:02] <Bjerre> I'm slowly melting away here in my 30 celsius
[02:31:03] <kokut> so its not really working as an index of the whole selection but of the parent..
[02:31:06] <Bjerre> room"
[02:31:16] <Cork> kokut: var grid = $('.class-name'); grid.hover(function() { grid.index(this) });
[02:31:30] <kokut> Bjerre: lol i'm freaking freezing with the air conditioner, its like the north pole in here
[02:31:44] <Cork> kokut: .index() on the element it self will give you the child index of the parent
[02:31:45] <kokut> Cork: k lemme try
[02:31:49] <Bjerre> ofc you have an air conditioner... lucky you
[02:31:57] <kokut> Bjerre: yea man i'm so lucky
[02:32:03] <kokut> Bjerre: im in heaven
[02:32:08] <Bjerre> :o
[02:32:25] <Bjerre> that's my face of melting
[02:32:49] <Bjerre> .o lost my eye
[02:47:57] <kokut> Bjerre: just work really hard until you can rent a place with air conditioner or something
[02:53:01] <Bjerre> kokut: true
[02:53:13] <Bjerre> kokut: did you work hard or did your parents buy you the air conditioner? :)
[02:53:51] <kokut> Bjerre: i'm working really hard, but i'm also renting a place with one for only 110€/month so
[02:54:09] <Bjerre> aaah that's so worth it
[02:54:20] <Bjerre> I've become liquid now
[02:54:29] <Bjerre> can you send one AC over sea?
[02:55:00] <Bjerre> I pay you 200 euro a month for the AC :E
[02:55:14] <Bjerre> you have to install it though
[02:55:52] <Bjerre> I only need it for 1 week as well since the summer in Sweden is shit anyway
[02:56:49] <rickthuc> Hello, Why is the fancybox inline content not getting loaded here ? http://tinyurl.com/o2c5uox
[02:56:50] <kokut> lol, come to my place i have 2 rooms left
[03:00:44] <rickthuc> ?
[03:08:16] <rickthuc> hello?
[03:09:48] <rickthuc> who places all these bots in channel for room top
[03:12:23] <Tennis> whats room top ? rickthuc ?
[03:13:04] <Cork> rickthuc: most of them are managed by individuals (not the same person)
[03:13:28] <Cork> there are also bots provided by the network, but those are only for managing permissions
[03:14:05] <BlueShark> rickthuc: Are you talking about ChanServ?
[03:15:40] <kokut> Cork: how can i pass a variable between two functions in the hover arguments?
[03:15:45] <Bjerre> rickthuc: check your console
[03:15:56] <Bjerre> and damn that site was slow on load
[03:16:29] <kokut> Cork: grid.hover(function(x){x = 1;},function(x){console.log(x)}); not working
[03:16:36] <Cork> kokut: share a variable scope
[03:16:42] <kokut> how?
[03:16:57] <Cork> var sharedVariable; .hover(func,func)
[03:17:35] <kokut> Cork: i defined x on top of the grid call
[03:18:51] <kokut> var x = ''; grid.hover(function(x)... not working
[03:19:29] <Cork> kokut: ya, cause you define x again
[03:19:42] <Cork> so x inside the function becomes event
[03:20:01] <rickthuc> Bjerre: I already checked the console..
[03:20:23] <Bjerre> then paste your problem on jsfiddle
[03:20:29] <rickthuc> nevermind i will make it on my own
[03:20:35] <Bjerre> it's impossible to tell what's going on when you're using that site as an example
[03:20:46] <rickthuc> even jsfiddle is a site
[03:20:58] <Bjerre> it's for pasting your code
[03:21:04] <Bjerre> to simulate the same problem
[03:21:10] <rickthuc> it's for wasting time too
[03:21:15] <Bjerre> ...
[03:21:17] <kokut> Cork: nice, it works now, ty
[03:21:29] <rickthuc> nvm i will make somethin manually..
[03:21:34] <Bjerre> ok
[03:21:38] <Bjerre> good luck chef
[03:38:48] <Bjerre> devoldmx_ what are you doing?
[03:53:37] <Bjerre> to hide a dive and show a div do I use $('#foo').hide() and $('#foo').show() ?
[03:53:43] <Bjerre> or do I need to use css for this?
[03:55:01] <vdeep> Bjerre no, jquery will handle it
[03:55:09] <Bjerre> ok cool vdeep
[03:56:15] <Bjerre> ye that worked great
[04:00:21] <rickthuc> Bjeere: better hide it with css or the div will show for a few seconds while the page loads..
[04:26:27] <samons> hi
[04:26:33] <samons> jquery ui channel?
[04:32:57] <fattest> why i click on a link on my left menu bar, it should show the corresponding <li> in the "dashboard" dropdown and hide the other <li>'s why isn't it doing it? http://jsbin.com/xaqifegile/edit?html,js,output
[04:35:16] <taplar> fattest: you realize your binding on the li, not the link, yes?
[04:35:57] <fattest> taplar $(".sidebar-menu li.menu-item").click(function(e){  ?
[04:36:04] <taplar> yes
[04:36:09] <fattest> yes that is fine
[04:36:20] <fattest> that is being triggered as i requested
[04:36:35] <taplar> so if you want to hide others and show current that could be a simple $(this).siblings().hide();  $(this).show()
[04:36:54] <fattest> taplar: oh no
[04:37:03] <fattest> taplar in the dashboard dropdown, it needs to show the correspondign <li>
[04:37:18] <fattest> taplar in the document.ready() i hid them $('[id^=link-]').hide();
[04:38:25] <taplar> ah, so it's those li's you want to manipulate
[04:39:01] <fattest> taplar when i click on .menu-item, i want it to show the corresponding <li> in the <ul class="treeview-menu">
[04:40:37] <taplar> right now i'm just wondering why your doing the closest function off of the e.target
[04:40:53] <fattest> taplar to find out which link was clicked
[04:41:07] <taplar> that would be simply $(this)
[04:41:15] <fattest> oh
[04:41:40] <fattest> thanks
[04:43:16] <samons> hi
[04:43:34] <taplar> but aside from that, the console on that page is writing out "link1" so your selector is doing "#linklink1"
[04:44:22] <samons> I'm posting code after that i will ask question http://kopy.io/Dt4vE
[04:44:25] <Bjerre> guys, how do I get both of these divs to change image? http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/5dkwdg6v/12/
[04:44:40] <samons> After cache position does not work
[04:45:18] <fattest> taplar ok after i changed it to $("#" + title).show();, why doesn't it work again if i click a different link?
[04:46:49] <taplar> can you update your pastiebin?
[04:46:54] <fattest> ok
[04:48:47] <fattest> taplar http://jsbin.com/gomuheguni/1/edit?js,output
[04:49:40] <samons> any suggestion?
[04:49:56] <taplar> Bjerre: http://jsfiddle.net/5dkwdg6v/13/
[04:50:02] <taplar> Bjerre: i converted the previous
[04:51:32] <Bjerre> I don't understand why .each makes it work taplar  but thanks a lot mate
[04:51:39] <Bjerre> awesome
[04:51:57] <diegoviola> I'm doing something like this: $("#container-messages").find(".ratings").raty({ path: "/images", click: function(score, evt){ alert("ID: " + data.article_id + "\nbody: " + data.body); } }); but then all the .ratings got the same data.article_id on it, is there a way I can have them with their own data.article_id?
[04:52:18] <diegoviola> or I need persistence for that and then iterate on the data?
[04:52:25] <samons> yes diegoviola
[04:52:32] <diegoviola> samons: so persistence?
[04:52:40] <samons> span.ratings
[04:53:57] <taplar> fattest: in that pastiebin i don't see where your setting selected
[04:53:59] <diegoviola> samons: what do you mean with span.ratings? by persistence I mean storing all the data title, body and _id on the db and then show all of it
[04:54:12] <samons> i've multiple rating on single page it work with span.rating
[04:54:13] <diegoviola> but I'm not sure how to have my ajax update when the db changes
[04:54:36] <fattest> taplar i got rid of the variable after learning $(this)
[04:55:29] <diegoviola> samons: by span you mean <span> as in the HTML tag or?
[04:55:33] <taplar> fattest: so just: title = $(this).text()
[04:55:38] <samons> yeah
[04:56:06] <fattest> taplar ok http://jsbin.com/gomuheguni/1/edit?js,output
[04:56:19] <diegoviola> samons: I'm using a plugin that uses a div with img tags
[04:57:23] <hellyeah> why it didnt show anything https://jsfiddle.net/gx479ksr/
[04:58:50] <Bjerre> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/5dkwdg6v/14/   can only get left arrow to work
[04:58:53] <Cork> hellyeah: d.documentelement  => d.documentElement for one
[04:59:35] <hellyeah> i dont get it totally Cork
[04:59:47] <Cork> ?mdn documentelement
[04:59:48] <b-ot> Cork: Document.documentElement - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/documentElement
[04:59:52] <Cork> wrong case
[05:00:18] <Bjerre> oh var plugin is undefined
[05:01:46] <Bjerre> hmm
[05:03:26] <taplar> Bjerre: http://jsfiddle.net/5dkwdg6v/15/
[05:03:53] <Bjerre> yea taplar  http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/5dkwdg6v/16/
[05:03:57] <Bjerre> I did something similar
[05:04:00] <Bjerre> thanks mate
[05:05:05] <taplar> fattest: still looking at yours
[05:05:14] <fattest> taplar thank you so much
[05:12:57] <taplar> fattest: alright, something in your logic is setting the text of all your inputs to Link 1
[05:13:28] <taplar> fattest: in your document ready put   console.log( $('.treeview-menu').prop('outerHTML') );  at the end and take a look
[05:13:37] <fattest> ok
[05:15:38] <fattest> taplar http://i.imgur.com/59qM74e.png
[05:16:05] <taplar> yep, see your span values
[05:17:08] <fattest> i do
[05:17:13] <fattest> taplar they all changed to link 1
[05:17:40] <fattest> taplar but im not changing the text
[05:18:12] <taplar> not in the code sniplet you showed me, nope, don't see where you are.  so must be happening else where
[05:19:28] <Velveeta> does it ever show up as something *not* link 1, and then change at some visible point? you could try dropping in a dom breakpoint to find the code that's causing it
[05:19:30] <taplar> and to emphasize that, i commented your entire code sniplet, and all the links are showing now, and they are all link 1
[05:19:35] <taplar> so yes, it is happening else where
[05:21:06] <fattest> taplar the other js files in the template are editing it you think right?
[05:22:52] <fattest> taplar so there is no workaround solution ?
[05:24:13] <taplar> wait
[05:24:14] <taplar> lol
[05:24:26] <taplar> your html has them all at Link 1 by default....
[05:24:36] <taplar> v_v
[05:25:15] <fattest> taplar well, im an idiot
[05:25:19] <fattest> taplar thank you so much!
[05:25:51] <taplar> i'm not much better, took me that long to see it, lol
[05:25:54] <taplar> is it friday yet?
[05:33:31] <fattest> taplar if i were to change the <li> to <ul>, why does it behave differently now? http://jsbin.com/gomuheguni/1/edit?html,output
[05:34:08] <fattest> taplar why does it "literally" show the link 1, shouldn't it be in the drop down of the dash board?
[05:34:29] <fattest> taplar and when i click on a different <li> and click dashboard, it changes to link 1
[05:34:52] <taplar> what did you change to ul?
[05:36:29] <fattest> taplar i changed the 4 <li> to <ul>
[05:36:29] <taplar> i made some changes and it is working now.  did it auto save so you can see them?  haven't played much with jsbin
[05:36:50] <fattest> taplar look at http://jsbin.com/gomuheguni/1/edit?html,output please
[05:37:26] <taplar> fattest: you still haven't not change your html links to be Link 1, Link 2, ...
[05:37:30] <taplar> they're all still Link 1
[05:37:42] <taplar> ^heh, double negative
[05:38:00] <fattest> taplar http://i.imgur.com/3mYRgO3.png
[05:38:28] <taplar> can you update your bin?
[05:39:27] <taplar> and you still have an issue with: title = selected.text().toString();
[05:39:31] <taplar> selected is undefined
[05:39:40] <taplar> title = $(this).text();
[05:39:54] <fattest> taplar its not updating the code
[05:39:58] <fattest> taplar i fixed all of this
[05:40:03] <taplar> ah, hmm
[05:40:28] <brennino> hi, I'm trying to make synchronous ajax calls chain, with jquery deferred objects, with a custom attribute but I can't understand how to do them correctly.
[05:40:40] <brennino> I follow this answer on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16026942/how-do-i-chain-three-asynchronous-calls-using-jquery-promises
[05:40:48] <fattest> tapler http://jsbin.com/doqunapidi/1/edit?html,output
[05:40:49] <fattest> try that one
[05:40:53] <brennino> but I need custom arguments on functions.
[05:41:00] <brennino> this is a jsbin for try to make you understand better what I need;
[05:41:06] <brennino> https://jsbin.com/letamatiha/edit?html,js,output
[05:41:32] <taplar> sweet alright
[05:41:48] <taplar> fattest: so the link is changing right now.  so what's the issue now?
[05:42:08] <fattest> taplar why isn't the <ul> not hidden in the dropdown of the "dashboard" ul?
[05:42:20] <fattest> taplar it should only be visible when i click on the dropdown dashboard
[05:45:43] <taplar> fattest: your showing them now when you click the link
[05:45:56] <taplar> whatever you had before that was controlling the outer visibility is not there now
[05:46:05] <fattest> taplar how do i fix it?
[05:47:10] <taplar> you'd need to encapsulate your links in some form of container, and toggle it's visibility on the click of your arrow
[05:47:26] <taplar> that way regardless of the inner visibility state of the elements, they will or won't show depending on the arrow
[05:47:36] <fattest> taplar can you please put it in an example
[05:50:30] <taplar> fattest: http://jsbin.com/ponudikoku/1/edit?html,js,output
[05:50:55] <taplar> styling is a little weird now, but
[05:52:47] <fattest> i see
[05:52:52] <fattest> ill try to fix it
[05:53:09] <diegoviola> ajax request on some db change, how to please?
[05:53:11] <diegoviola> what's the best way to do this
[05:53:26] <diegoviola> not sure I want long polling or anything like that
[05:53:56] <taplar> diegoviola: uh, vague question.  more info please?
[05:54:50] <taplar> oh!
[05:55:03] <taplar> you mean, something on the backend changes and you want the front end to know?
[05:55:40] <fattest> taplar why are these styles happening?
[05:55:42] <taplar> if it is available to you, use websockets for that, otherwise, long polling is your other primary option
[05:55:54] <diegoviola> taplar: I'm doing a $.post() from jquery where I take data from a form and send it to a server, the server then takes this data and does a request via php curl to some REST API where I get json back, I parse this data and I want to do a SQL INSERT to mariadb database, then I want to show (both what I've sent to the server and what I've got back from it)
[05:56:05] <diegoviola> taplar: think of it like a chat application
[05:56:15] <taplar> yep, websockets
[05:56:32] <diegoviola> taplar: right now I have thi scode and it works and I'm using ajax, but I don't have any persistence
[05:56:51] <diegoviola> taplar: I want to change my code so that what I send to server and I receive persists in the database
[05:57:29] <diegoviola> persistence will probably simplify my code a bit
[05:58:51] <diegoviola> thanks for your help
[05:58:52] <fattest> taplar thank you for your help!
[05:58:56] <diegoviola> greatly appreciated
[05:59:12] <taplar> fattest: get it down?
[05:59:28] <fattest> taplar i udnerstand how you did it , but i can't fix the styling
[06:04:48] <diegoviola> long polling is just an ajax request with a longer timeout or ttl?
[06:05:48] <Mandevil> Any ideas on why the activation of the buttons by keypress event (a,b,c) doesn't work in this example until first clicked with mouse? http://jsfiddle.net/ouwa50fw/
[06:06:09] <taplar> my history with long polling is not that good.  others might be able to answer.
[06:06:33] <taplar> my assumption is that it makes a request and stays open until the server or browser forces the connection to die due to inactivity.  and on that event opens another
[06:08:02] <taplar> though i've seen examples of where a site used a hidden iframe that would return the information it needed with an embedded refresh in it for the polling
[06:08:17] <taplar> that's just normal old school polling though
[06:10:17] <taplar> Mandevil: does it only do that in the fiddle?  with the fiddle I assume it doesn't work because until you click that frame it does not have focus for the events
[06:10:46] <Mandevil> taplar: Gotcha!
[06:10:52] <Mandevil> taplar: Yes, that's why.
[06:10:54] <Uhkis> Mandevil: because your keypress handler has no logic in it
[06:10:56] <taplar> ;)
[06:10:56] <Mandevil> taplar: Thank you!
[06:11:17] <Mandevil> Uhkis: I'm just prototyping something :)
[06:12:44] <Uhkis> oh, nvm, taplar is correct
[06:13:15] <Mandevil> I want a DOM element to have attached keyboard shortcut...
[06:13:37] <taplar> elaborate?
[06:14:19] <goldfinger> I want to add some shiny effects to this bar of gold
[06:14:19] <goldfinger> http://imgur.com/wBqrFij
[06:14:22] <goldfinger> any ideas?
[06:14:48] <taplar> more of a css question
[06:18:42] <Mandevil> taplar: Activate a UI element with keypresses instead of clicking with mouse.... this kind of thing.
[06:19:52] <taplar> oh, were you describing the intent of your fiddle?  i didn't know if it was a statement or a question or what
[06:20:30] <Mandevil> taplar: yes, intent.
[06:20:35] <taplar> :)
[06:20:44] <Mandevil> taplar: I'm sure I'm rediscovering the wheel here...
[06:20:55] <Mandevil> I mean reinventing
[06:21:03] <taplar> at least your refinding it, and not recreating it
[06:21:08] <taplar> lol
[06:24:11] <taplar> the only thing i might suggest for that, and this is just my personal taste, would be to store the key values in named variables so your code would read evt.which == keyA or something like that so it's a bit more self documenting
[06:24:49] <Mandevil> taplar: That's not good enough. I'm thinking about storing the key into custom attribute of the dom element itself.
[06:25:02] <hellyeah> whar did i do wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/pq2sLx40/46/
[06:25:25] <taplar> hellyeah: what are you expecting to happen?
[06:25:52] <hellyeah> when i click the windows moda window will appear
[06:26:35] <taplar> hellyeah: you have a syntax error on your popup, it's missing a closing )
[06:26:42] <Bjerre> hmm .css('visibility', 'hidden') is not activating during an animation :/
[06:26:43] <taplar> sorry, dialog
[06:26:50] <hellyeah> with table
[06:26:53] <Bjerre> perhaps only my project or someone who knows?
[06:27:58] <taplar> hellyeah: and a missing ) on the end of addEventListener
[06:29:29] <diegoviola> is long polling just an ajax request with a higher connection timeout?
[06:30:29] <taplar> http://www.pubnub.com/blog/http-long-polling/ diegoviola
[06:30:37] <diegoviola> thanks
[06:31:47] <diegoviola> not sure if I want long polling or websockets for this
[06:31:55] <diegoviola> websockets are pretty well supported nowadays, aren't they?
[06:32:20] <taplar> uh, i believe you need grails or nodejs or possibly ruby on the back end to use websockets
[06:32:52] <taplar> the server has to be able to support the elevate request
[06:32:52] <diegoviola> that's fine
[06:33:09] <diegoviola> ty
[06:33:09] <Mandevil> taplar: Something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/ouwa50fw/1/ ... the keyboard shortcut key is attached to the element with "data-key" custom attribute.
[06:33:57] <taplar> Mandevil: aaaah, gotcha
[06:35:07] <Mandevil> Maybe adding some debouncing would be good idea.
[06:35:12] <taplar> Mandevil: or reduced a bit http://jsfiddle.net/ouwa50fw/2/
[06:35:48] <Mandevil> taplar: Ah, good...
[06:36:04] <Mandevil> Oh, there's even data() function.
[06:36:09] <Mandevil> I didn't know that.
[06:36:28] <taplar> and you could move the .key find into the top selector, just separate with a space
[06:36:39] <Mandevil> Yeah, sure.
[06:36:49] <Mandevil> I guess internally it's no different.
[06:37:36] <hellyeah> there is no pop up appear when i click button can you take a look? http://jsfiddle.net/pq2sLx40/48/
[06:37:59] <diegoviola> ok so websockets were introduced to have a less hacky solution than long polling?
[06:39:16] <taplar> hellyeah: what is 'your_variable' ?
[06:40:04] <taplar> diegoviola: websockets were created as a replacement to polling.  it has multiple benifits.  first being that it is a persistent connection between the client and server, so you can implement true pub/sub model
[06:40:30] <hellyeah> ops
[06:40:35] <taplar> and also using pub/sub you send only the data, you do not have to go through the whole http protocol handshake, sending header information all that, for every request
[06:40:46] <Velveeta> taplar: question - if it's persistent, do you have to worry about running out of open sockets at the server level?
[06:40:46] <taplar> so it's smaller and more efficient
[06:41:10] <taplar> Velveeta: depending on the popularity of the site, i'm sure that could be a concern
[06:41:17] <Velveeta> gotcha
[06:41:41] <hellyeah> taplar:  my variable is table  var table = showTable();
[06:41:47] <taplar> though if you have a traffic heavy site, hopefully you have planned ahead and have multiple back end servers being redirected to through a load balancer
[06:42:19] <diegoviola> taplar: great, thanks
[06:43:38] <taplar> hellyeah: line 17 in your fiddle you have that variable, but i don't see it defined.  something you are missing?
[06:44:05] <Velveeta> i have a traffic heavy site.. we get more hits than reddit.. but i only have my old commodore set up to handle it, so nobody ever gets to see it because the box dies
[06:44:16] <taplar> lol
[06:44:47] <hellyeah> taplar:  it is table variable look at here http://jsfiddle.net/pq2sLx40/54/
[06:47:03] <taplar> hellyeah: also, I see that you are initializing the dialog, but until you invoke the open function, it won't display
[06:48:59] <hellyeah> taplar:  does it seem better http://jsfiddle.net/pq2sLx40/56/
[06:54:12] <Mandevil> taplar: Now what if I want to have input field(s) on the same page.... all the typing will go through that keypress handler :-I
[06:55:31] <taplar> Mandevil: so your binding to the body I take it?
[06:55:48] <Mandevil> taplar: To $(document)
[06:56:04] <Mandevil> I guess I could mask this by binding to lower-level elements.
[06:57:14] <taplar> you could, with the affect that it would only trigger if a child element had focus
[07:01:05] <hellyeah> couldnt see table in pop up window can you help me to figure that out_ http://jsfiddle.net/pq2sLx40/61/
[07:06:04] <Mandevil> How do I bring element to focus programmatically?
[07:06:13] <Mandevil> Is there focus() function?
[07:07:15] <Mandevil> Yeah, there's one.
[07:07:24] <taplar> afk
[07:11:06] <Mandevil> Aaaand another problem.
[07:11:29] <Mandevil> How do I block character appearing in INPUT TYPE="text" that was caught by the keypress handler?
[07:11:39] <Mandevil> I do "return false" but that doesn't seem to help.
[07:12:41] <Mandevil> No it works.
[07:12:44] <Mandevil> I'm just confused.
[07:15:08] <brennino> please, can someone tell me if this is the right way for chain jquery deferred object with custom argument in a synchronous way?

[07:15:51] <brennino> customwizardAddToCart always return a deferred promise

[08:25:57] <Uhkis> that one doesnt work
[08:26:27] <gnarf> Uhkis: sorry - my compose key ♥ -- (╯‵Д′)╯彡┻━┻ -- (屮'Д')屮 -- https://github.com/gnarf/osx-compose-key
[08:26:33] <taplar> out of curiosity, is there a reason you looking up the tds by position rather than their attached class?
[08:26:35] <garethdaine> Got a select2 question if anyone can help?
[08:26:36] <jak2000> gnarf worked with your advice
[08:26:38] <Uhkis> !flip

[08:26:59] <gnarf> Y U NO
[08:27:03] * gnarf shrugs
[08:27:10] <gnarf> i thought b-ot replied to those
[08:27:15] <gnarf> b-ot: are you working?
[08:27:15] <b-ot> gnarf: you may rely on it.
[08:27:17] <garethdaine> Using the tags option, how do you go about adding tags to the input as default?
[08:27:19] <gnarf> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[08:27:35] <Uhkis> bot has been a bit iffy for a while
[08:27:35] <gnarf> garethdaine: tags?
[08:27:46] <gnarf> `botcookie
[08:28:02] <gnarf> ☹
[08:28:46] <garethdaine> gnarf: Yeah, select2 has tagging support. using ‘tags: true’. I have this workign great but I want to be able to autopopulate the field with default tags
[08:29:02] <garethdaine> Like in the ‘Tagging Support’ example https://select2.github.io/examples.html
[08:29:13] <garethdaine> Just can’t see any code examples on how to do this
[08:29:45] <gnarf> garethdaine: did you try adding selected="selected" to the options you wanted selected?
[08:29:53] <gnarf> garethdaine: view source on the tagging support

[08:45:53] <brennino> Hi, can someone tell me if this is the right way for chain jquery deferred object with custom argument in a synchronous way?
[08:45:53] <brennino> customwizardAddToCart(20).then(function(){return customwizardAddToCart(21)}).then(function(){return customwizardAddToCart(22)});
[08:45:53] <brennino> customwizardAddToCart always return a deferred promise
[09:02:06] <brennino> no one can help me 1 minute?
[09:07:49] <gnarf> yeah that should do them in serial waiting for each
[09:14:59] <brennino> thanks gnarf I appreciate!
[09:29:25] <hep_> Hello, I am having a problem where when a user logs in and they are redirected to a new page the page does not load and the url doesn't update to the new page. It seems like the new page is just loaded into the dom along with the login page.
[09:37:23] <ziikutv> hey how can i change this property directly? https://bpaste.net/show/09abc22614b0
[09:39:21] <decx> you have to keep track of the translate state yourself
[09:39:51] <decx> also css() already does the prefixing for you
[09:41:23] <ziikutv> .css('transform', 'translate(e.pageX)');
[09:41:37] <decx> what's this for
[09:41:49] <ziikutv> i want to shift the iamge left and right to achieve a pan effect
[09:42:41] <decx> it has to be relative to document position and element width
[10:31:29] <ziikutv> how do i do something only if TWO events occur without nesting the functions?
[10:32:04] <decx> what two events would that be
[10:36:04] <ziikutv> decx: When a certain key is pressed and scroll wheel is occuring. I already have $('html, body, *').mousewheel(function(e, delta) {}.. now I m wondering if its just a matter of nesting or having a boolean that says so and so key is pressed
[10:37:39] <decx> on keydown set a higher scoped variable to true and set it to false on keyup
[10:37:47] <decx> then access that in your wheel event
[10:38:29] <ziikutv> mhm thats my current setup i thought there would be a better way to do it though
[10:39:02] <decx> na that's fine
[10:39:08] <ziikutv> cool
[10:53:39] <ziikutv> also is it a good idea to nest EVERYTHING without window/on load or document.ready or netiher is required
[11:45:46] <ziikutv> decx: Forgot to say thank you very much..
[11:46:05] <ziikutv> decx: You can see my progress here. https://github.com/Saquettaire/Stomp
[11:46:55] <DanielCE> Hey guys i wanted to consult about painting and preformances isues, looks like when i use display: block/hide cause repaint of those blocks, there is a way to avoid it and hide it without repaint?
[12:34:50] <DanielCE> anyone?
[12:47:24] <decx> you have to take the element out of the pageflow
[12:47:34] <decx> DanielCE ^^
[12:51:52] <_u2pop_> hello all
[12:55:40] <MikeD_> why doesn't keypress capture backspace and delete?
[13:00:10] <decx> they do?
[13:02:08] <pyCasso> while using jquery ajax method is it possible to get only a container div oppose to the entire page from the response?
[13:02:52] <|PiP|> pyCasso: yes
[13:03:27] <|PiP|> pyCasso: you can use  $.load()
[13:04:02] <pyCasso> how is it defined with ajax?
[13:04:05] <pyCasso> $.ajax({
[13:04:06] <pyCasso> url: '/stl/dform2',
[13:04:06] <pyCasso> type: 'get',
[13:04:06] <pyCasso> async: false,
[13:04:06] <pyCasso> success: function (data) {                           $("#results").html(data '#somediv');
[13:04:06] <pyCasso> }
[13:04:06] <pyCasso> });
[13:04:17] <pyCasso> sorry
[13:05:07] <robertmaxrees> you can pull it inside the callback.
[13:05:15] <pyCasso> https://bpaste.net/show/e413b89b9f41
[13:05:39] <robertmaxrees> var myContainer = $(data).find('#someDiv'); $('#results').append(myContainer);
[13:05:56] <|PiP|> you can simply do $('#results').load(url + ' #somediv')
[13:06:15] <robertmaxrees> |PiP| some people prefer to consistently use $.ajax() instead :)
[13:08:01] <pyCasso> robermaxrees: like this? https://bpaste.net/show/967eba86f679
[13:08:16] <pyCasso> Whats wrong with ajax that I shouldn't use it?
[13:08:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:08:32] <robertmaxrees> nothing is - i said some people prefer to use it instead of $.load();
[13:08:40] <|PiP|> u need a space
[13:08:40] <robertmaxrees> if you want to use load, $.load('/stl/aboutus #someDiv');
[13:09:03] <|PiP|> and u need the element as well
[13:09:14] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/load/#loading-page-fragments
[13:09:19] <robertmaxrees> for the relevant documentation.
[13:09:20] <|PiP|> $('#results').load('/stl/aboutus #somediv')
[13:09:49] <pyCasso> ok. i see
[13:11:46] <SmashingX2> I’m using jqte() text editor but I don’t know how to insert images with that editor. Is there any way to do it?
[13:12:09] <SmashingX2> I actually see in their demos that they have an image there but I don’t know how they inserted it
[13:12:35] <Razerglass> hello im using a basic bootstrap progress bar, how would I call the 'width value' with jquery?     i use this to set it  $(".progress-bar").css("width", "50%");
[13:12:45] <Razerglass> $(".progress-bar").attr('width')  does not work
[13:12:55] <robertmaxrees> Razerglass .css('width')
[13:13:08] <Razerglass> but that gives me like 500px, i want the % value to check against
[13:13:28] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/744383/923919
[13:15:16] <Razerglass> theres no way to access the direct value of 50% ? .css gives me 569px im not sure i understand the stackO link
[13:16:04] <SmashingX2> I’m using jQTE() text editor but I don’t know how to insert images with that editor. Is there any way to do it?
[13:16:27] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 instead of spamming the channel, why not link to a fiddle/their docs?
[13:21:13] <SmashingX2> http://jqueryte.com/demos
[13:21:51] <robertmaxrees> the html edit mode.
[13:22:46] <robertmaxrees> that's my guess at least.
[13:23:09] <SmashingX2> what’s the point of the wysiwyg then?
[13:23:43] <robertmaxrees> did you try dragging and dropping on it?
[13:23:49] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea mano.  just guessing ;)
[14:15:57] <ziikutv> the keyCodes.. are they just charsCodes?
[14:18:46] <ziikutv> Because I am getting "z" = 122 and "Z" = 90 in Node/javascrpt while jQuery is backwards.
[14:19:10] <ziikutv> nevermind :|
[14:19:33] <SmashingX2> Uncaught Error: no such method 'collapse' for collapsible widget instance
[14:19:50] <ziikutv>  if (e.which == 90) is triggered when I press Shift Z too
[14:19:52] <SmashingX2> I followed $( ".selector" ).collapsible( "collapse" );
[14:20:06] <SmashingX2> I have this in my code: $("#contentUpdateFormWrap").collapsible( "collapse" );;
[14:25:00] <ziikutv> SmashingX2: Upload code on gist.github.com or jsfiddle neve paste code here.
[14:27:47] <SmashingX2> http://jsfiddle.net/ayEWB/3/
[14:45:50] <SmashingX2> ziikutv: still nothing
[14:46:09] <cek> I'd like to store a reference to jquery object globally. What are my options aside of data($('body'), "key", $obj)
[14:47:11] <ziikutv> SmashingX2: i was working didnt notice the link because you didnt add my name in the message. Sorry aboutthat. So All you are trying to do here is add a class?
[14:47:22] <Zzaichik> SmashingX2: gots to set that fiddle up correctly. Can't find jquery in a js folder.
[14:48:22] <ziikutv> SmashingX2: I see what you are doing..
[14:48:30] <Zzaichik> SmashingX2: http://jsfiddle.net/ayEWB/338/ 338? damn..
[14:49:09] <|PiP|> whats the best way of queueing ajax calls to happen one after another?
[14:49:13] <ziikutv> SmashingX2: You need to do something like: $(selector).attr('data-collapsed',false)
[14:49:24] <ziikutv> you do not need to have the False has a string.
[14:53:25] <ziikutv> |PiP|: Here, you see async? Set that param to false then put all your calls in an array then iterate through all the calls using a for loop. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[14:56:01] <ziikutv> |PiP|: https://bpaste.net/show/2ec0d2853ebf
[15:21:39] <xar> I'm trying to connect to mongodb using nodejs, but I get this output `{ [MongoError: connect ECONNREFUSED] name: 'MongoError', message: 'connect ECONNREFUSED' }`. what's wrong please?
[16:18:17] <kevireilly> xar: check to make sure that you can indeed access that host from your source
[16:45:18] <skinux> Anyone familiar with jQuery.sheets? Doesn't seem to be much of documentation for showing how to actually use the library.

[19:36:52] <hellyeah> hey there
[19:39:26] <hellyeah> hey why that doesnt work https://jsfiddle.net/sp3wnyho/
[19:44:03] <rcyr> hellyeah: Because you're not using :first-child properly.
[19:44:58] <rcyr> tr td:first-child
[19:45:06] <rcyr> Learn CSS before jQuery, it's a must.
[19:45:55] <hellyeah> you mean this btw https://jsfiddle.net/sp3wnyho/2/
[19:46:20] <rcyr> Yes.
[19:46:38] <rcyr> It's the first-child of tag "td" that you want
[19:47:04] <kevireilly> hellyeah: couple reasons.. jquery isn’t added on the left under Frameworks & Extensions, the highlight_row class isn’t added in the css in the top right, and for the jquery selector you probably intend td:first-child
[19:47:04] * kevireilly may have missed some messages
[19:47:23] <rcyr> kevireilly: I think you're right :)
[19:47:56] * hellyeah reading
[19:48:10] <hellyeah> kevireilly:
[19:48:19] <hellyeah> you know i always forget to add that
[19:48:23] <hellyeah> thanks for warning
[19:49:23] <hellyeah> okey but not clickable https://jsfiddle.net/sp3wnyho/3/
[19:49:45] <hellyeah> hmm
[19:53:33] <feathersanddown> Hi!, I know that is not jquery specific question, but can some one show me the light to make Globalization work with as the spinner jqueryui example
[19:55:14] <feathersanddown> because now jqueryui needs globalization that needs cldr for i18n, and the only thing I want is to use spinner to stop selecting more hours than 24
[19:55:20] <feathersanddown> and less than 00
[19:58:01] <feathersanddown> anyway.... left as is, need to continue with other things :)
[20:40:39] <nt2subtle> hey all
[20:41:35] <nt2subtle> need some help. I've created a JS function that determines a result based on values. Now I managed to pull that value out via Jquery with an alert but now I neeed that info to pop up in a div.
[20:46:39] <nt2subtle> anyone??
[21:14:11] <lenswipee> my dialog box position is not being honoured, see https://jsfiddle.net/347adkhv/
[21:14:13] <lenswipee> help
[21:42:47] <lenswipee> has jquery dialog position been deprecated or something
[22:23:30] <printForever> ok... how do I open the file browse dialog? http://jsfiddle.net/mn4uxkot/
[22:24:18] <printForever> I tried click(), on(click), trigger()
[22:24:21] <printForever> nothing worked
[22:41:39] <printForever> BabaBooey?
[22:53:08] <vdeep> printForever works fine for me http://jsfiddle.net/vdeep/mn4uxkot/1/
[22:53:34] <printForever> but...
[22:53:59] <vdeep> printForever something wrong??
[22:54:18] <printForever> I was targeting FORM tag all the time
[22:54:25] <printForever> FORM.on(click) trigger...
[22:54:32] <printForever> why is it H2?
[22:54:43] <vdeep> because h2 is the topmost element
[22:54:54] <printForever> oh for crying out loud...
[22:54:55] <vdeep> taking up all the space
[22:55:13] <vdeep> you should consider using an anchor instead
[22:55:14] <printForever> thank you, I didn't think at all
[22:55:20] <vdeep> no problem
[23:18:52] <Razerglass> hello how can i grab the element right before ".last()"
[23:19:09] <Razerglass> $('a.navPages').last().attr('href')); gives me the very last link
[23:19:21] <Razerglass> $('a.navPages').last().prev().attr('href')); should give me the one before it?
[23:20:48] <Razerglass> is there another way to call previous? from my example
[23:23:20] <Cork> Razerglass: .slice(-2)
[23:23:33] <Cork> opps
[23:23:38] <Cork> that will give you the last two
[23:23:41] <Cork> Razerglass: .slice(-2, -1)
[23:23:42] <Razerglass> $('a.navPages').eq(-2).attr('href'));   .eq didnt even know it existed :D
[23:23:51] <decx> cork still asleep ^^
[23:24:06] <Cork> ah, eq takes negative numbers
[23:24:10] <Cork> didn't know that
[23:24:29] <Uhkis> what? there was something Cork didn't know?! :D
