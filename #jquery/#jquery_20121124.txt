[00:03:24] <aqeel> hi room
[00:04:34] <ravenzz> hi
[00:21:48] <javalover> does anyone here use vent/mumble?
[00:21:52] <javalover> i'm looking for a coding vent
[00:24:27] <jrockjiggz> I normally just vent on irc.. but mumble? only when I'm looking at someones code..
[00:52:34] <aro> is there a way to capture the element that was clicked to submit a form?
[00:52:41] <aro> i have a form with multiple submit buttons
[00:54:07] <jrockjiggz> aro: you would bind a submit to that form
[00:54:14] <aro> i have
[00:54:15] <aro> already
[00:54:17] <jrockjiggz> $('#formA').submit( function(){});
[00:54:32] <aro> im actually using .on
[00:54:48] <aro> $(document.body).on( 'submit', '#EditSurveyForm', function( ev, pass )
[00:55:28] <jrockjiggz> are you trying to find the submit button? can you not $(this).find('input[type=submit]);
[00:55:48] <jrockjiggz> im unclear the problem
[00:55:51] <aro> no, i am trying to perform an action based on which submit button is clicked
[00:56:03] <aro> i have two submits: 'Save Changes', 'Save and Send'
[00:56:12] <aro> if they click the first, i want to submit the form normally
[00:56:28] <aro> if they click the second, I want to display a popup that has a confirmation dialog
[00:56:48] <jrockjiggz> $('#buttonA').click...   $('#butotnB').click..   no?
[00:56:53] <aro> no
[00:57:01] <aro> are you new to jquery?
[00:57:18] <jrockjiggz> $('#formA').trigger('submit') to submit
[00:57:32] <aro> sigh..
[00:57:34] <jrockjiggz> no i just think what your over thinking it
[00:57:50] <aro> im not overthinking it
[00:58:08] <aro> your method won't work
[00:58:22] <jrockjiggz> i will explain on jsfiddle..
[01:00:49] <jrockjiggz> http://jsfiddle.net/jUxP8/
[01:01:59] <aro> ok
[01:02:02] <aro> so what am i supposed to do?
[01:02:38] <jrockjiggz> one submits, the other doesnt.. you can perform your actions?
[01:02:57] <aro> ok but i need two submit buttons
[01:03:17] <jrockjiggz> a form can only have one. it would be then invalid html
[01:03:22] <aro> lol
[01:03:30] <aro> not true
[01:04:17] <aqeel> you can have multiple submit based on different actions required
[01:04:52] <jrockjiggz> then how about? http://jsfiddle.net/jUxP8/1/
[01:04:54] <aro> when you click a submit button, it sends the name/value pair of that button
[01:05:39] <jrockjiggz> ahh. i see, $(this) is not what is clicked
[01:05:48] <aro> see my issue?
[01:06:11] <javalover> so is anyone in vent/mumble right now?
[01:06:14] <javalover> i'd kinda like to join...
[01:06:22] <aro> mumble?
[01:06:24] <aro> what is that
[01:06:34] <javalover> it's like ventrillo but different
[01:07:03] <aro> oh

[01:08:30] <aro> http://jsfiddle.net/barrychapman/wXAnq/1/
[01:08:31] <aro> rather
[01:08:51] <aro> thats just an example
[01:09:21] <aro> ack
[01:09:23] <aro> wrong part
[01:09:24] <aro> hang on
[01:12:32] <aro> http://jsfiddle.net/barrychapman/5UdkH/1/
[01:12:34] <aro> there
[01:15:25] <aqeel> {"error": "Please use POST request"}
[01:15:32] <aqeel> i getting this error
[01:15:49] <aro> huh?
[01:17:45] <aqeel> why don't you make use of two sifferent entities
[01:18:00] <aqeel> give them id and on() call the id
[01:18:26] <jrockjiggz> aro: this is what I came up with.. http://jsfiddle.net/jUxP8/2/
[01:18:46] <aro> aqeel: what do you mean
[01:23:43] <jrockjiggz> aro: http://jsfiddle.net/jUxP8/3/
[01:24:52] <jrockjiggz> i know you probably dont want the extra bind, but from what I can see, it gets the job done, not that difficult to read
[01:26:55] <jrockjiggz> final, concatinate the bindings.. http://jsfiddle.net/jUxP8/4/

[03:02:38] <sp1ral> Hi, i'm new to jquery and i'm trying to get my script to run a local perl cgi script and then add the result of that cgi script to the html page. I've tried googling but haven't found anything :(
[03:20:22] <aaairc> this has nothing to do with jquery, but i thought someone in here might know the answer to this... is it possible in the Chrome browser to go back to a webpage that is in your browsing history and use the cache of the browser to view the content that that page was previously showing you? i ask because i had a ticket reservation with a confirmation code that was never emailed to me, and now i can't find the confirmation code.
[03:27:57] <konradb> hello
[03:30:39] <konradb> I have function var src = $(this).attr("src").match(/[^\.]+/) + "_big.jpg"; which is changing image src from 'img/example.jpg' to 'img/example_big.jpg'. everything is working well, but when I have another link (wordpress, can't change) 'src='http://examplesite.com/img/example.jpg' it doesn't work. It is changing to 'http://examplesite_big.jpg'. I am not good in Jquery so I am asking, what should I change in match(*) to make it workin'? :)

[05:26:00] <Krambiorix> hi, is it possible to open a dialog in another dialog?
[05:26:43] <gnarf> yes, but it's usually a bad user experience to do so Krambiorix - might make more sense to replace the content of the already open dialog
[05:27:40] <Krambiorix> gnarf, hmmm
[05:34:38] <Krambiorix> gnarf, you're right, i'll open first dialog 1 , then 2
[06:00:39] <guigui22> Hi I would like to convert a csv file into Json. How can I parse the csv file and create a Json file with the csv columns?
[06:07:53] <Krambiorix> gnarf, i tried to open it, but the dialog doesn't show up : http://pastebin.com/yivsXX1P

[07:41:11] <juboba> is it possible to use jquery ui with bootstrap?
[07:44:38] <zhulikas> ofc
[08:05:45] <aqeel> all javascript libraries can be used with each other , just look and configure for overlaps
[08:05:47] <Taggnostr> I have  <input type="text" value="" id="searchbox"></input>  <input type="submit" id="searchbox-submit" value="Filter">  and  $('#searchbox-submit').click(dofilter);.  How can I make this work when I press enter while editing the first input too?
[08:33:33] <tMobile4a03> Hi, does .attr() and .prop() work on non-standard attributes? (those that are not defined in the standard, but rather user-defined ones)
[08:43:29] <veQue> how do i stop NaN from displaying? in my text field?
[08:44:24] <dns-away> how is defined nan ;?
[08:50:33] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/kFwfJ/2/
[08:50:40] <veQue> NaN keeps displaying
[08:53:33] <veQue> i want something like if (value == NaN)  value=' '
[09:08:22] <tMobile4a03> Hi, does .attr() and .prop() work on non-standard attributes? (those that are not defined in the standard, but rather user-defined ones)
[09:09:33] <sacho> what version?
[09:13:39] <sacho> prop just sets them as properties on the specific dom element
[09:13:58] <sacho> attr defers to prop if it's not a standard attribute
[09:33:49] <tMobile4a03> sacho: thanks for clearing them up, now I should wonder why my code doesn't work... oh well :P
[09:37:06] <aqeel> why wont there be instantaneous change....only after click and i move the mouse the chnages are reflected...
[09:38:22] <shoky> wat
[09:39:41] <aqeel> ie is showing this behaviour
[09:40:51] <shoky> right
[09:41:58] <aqeel> firefox is ok...
[09:42:28] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com...click detail then click the menu and click any link, do NOT move your mouse
[09:45:57] <polosson> Hi there ! I'm on a cruel bug which turn me mad
[09:46:13] <aqeel> and what might that be
[09:46:25] <polosson> about the animate() function,
[09:46:34] <aqeel> shoot at the room
[09:47:05] <polosson> when I set some params with %, it doesn't work on every screen resolution...
[09:47:36] <aqeel> you might wanna use media quries
[09:47:54] <polosson> media queries ?
[09:48:06] <polosson> don't know what is it ?
[09:48:45] <polosson> I just figured out that if I do the % > pixel conversion by myself, it works perfectly
[09:48:46] <aqeel> http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/
[09:49:00] <aqeel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/Media_queries
[09:49:58] <polosson> ok thx i take a look
[09:54:27] <shoky> aqeel: worked fine for me in ie9
[09:55:16] <aqeel> after click on the link from mainmenu do not move your mouse
[09:55:19] <polosson> ok, thanks aqeel... but I forgot to mention that it does work with chrome, but not with firefox...
[09:55:38] <shoky> aqeel: yes i read it the first time
[09:56:05] <aqeel> i am also on win 7 64 bit ie9, and i am having this issue strange
[09:56:29] <polosson> ah you got the issue too ?
[09:57:04] <polosson> I'm on Linux (Ubuntu) 64bits and firefox 17
[09:57:17] <shoky> aqeel: ah i see what you mean.. it responds instantly except for the 'locked'
[09:57:26] <aqeel> yes
[09:58:45] <aqeel> any idea what could the case be...
[09:59:07] <aqeel> i have 3 things, mouseenter, mouseleave and click
[09:59:26] <aqeel> and beofre 1.8, in 1.7.2 was perfect
[10:00:03] <aqeel> or how can i force top reflect this chnage
[10:00:08] <aqeel> to*
[10:01:18] <polosson> hum aqeel, you speak to me ?
[10:01:53] <aqeel> sorry polosson  i was dicussing mty case shoky
[10:02:05] <polosson> ah ok, no problem
[10:03:37] <polosson> so, if you want to test my code and see if it work for you... I'll be grateful (sorry for my bad english, I'm French), here is the link : http://www.figurelibre.polosson.com/
[10:03:46] <shoky> aqeel: well i dono the actual issue but i see that there are stuff like setting that text to 'sub menu - Locked' , that are being done on 'mouseleave' of smth
[10:04:04] <shoky> if you want them to happen for sure on the click then do that in the click handler
[10:04:49] <aqeel> i will look into that again but firefox does not have this issue
[10:06:31] <shoky> then maybe firefox is emitting a 'mouseleave' event where IE doesnt, or something of the sort..
[10:06:34] <spencerthayer> Hey everyone. I have a question about getting the height of a div dynamically. How would I alter this code to do that? http://jsfiddle.net/spencerthayer/RjdcV/26/
[10:07:56] <shoky> spencerthayer: what's the problem?
[10:08:07] <aqeel> well you see if element gets hidden it becomes mouseleave, but ie does not trigger this unless mouse is moved.....it seems ie still sees the layer being present
[10:08:30] <spencerthayer> When I change the browser size the div height actually increased but jQuery isn't accounting for that.
[10:08:37] <shoky> aqeel: that's why i said, if you want it to happen on click, then handle that in the click handler ;P
[10:08:51] <aqeel> thanks...
[10:08:55] <spencerthayer> So it outputs the value of the div's height on time of load not as it changes.
[10:09:06] <shoky> spencerthayer: oh, you'd need to set up a $(window).resize(..) handler
[10:09:18] <aqeel> for giving me testing time of yours
[10:09:20] <shoky> or better yet, use better css
[10:09:21] <spencerthayer> Ah. Thanks. Will google that.
[10:09:30] <shoky> wtf
[10:09:49] <shoky> who the f is Spam`Bot
[10:10:02] <shoky> and is he spamming everyone?
[10:10:13] <polosson> yep
[10:10:14] <aqeel> yes
[10:10:18] <shoky> o well.
[10:10:53] <aqeel> i got few days ealrlier too....guess this webchat have bugs
[10:11:16] <polosson> shoky or someone, can you please tell me if you already encounter the same issue as I have ?
[10:12:50] <polosson> which is : with animate() function, when I set some '%' params (like left, or width), it does not work on every screen resolution... actually, it works but there is a biiig lag (at least 1 minute)
[10:13:01] <jeremy-> I know this is scriptkiddy talk but I installed a theme and I cant work out why when i float: right the scrollbar moves to the left of the float. I havnt heard of it with css before, could it be like a jquery-ui thing or something like that? I'm using jquery-ui tabs
[10:13:11] <polosson> and, if I do the % > px conversion by myself, it's OK
[10:13:21] <jeremy-> i mean, entire page scrollbar fyi, not container float
[10:15:22] <aqeel> % takes the proportion of the awailable widthand height...if there are odd pixels, results will be strange
[10:15:24] <polosson> you can check if it work or not, on this page : http://www.figurelibre.polosson.com/
[10:15:57] <polosson> yes, I figured out that I had to parseInt() the conversion in order to have it working smoothly
[10:16:25] <aqeel> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/hh882445.aspx
[10:18:31] <aqeel> with float use position, on parent element
[10:26:46] <spencerthayer> Seems $(window).resize(function() { is incompatible.
[10:28:47] <spencerthayer> Uncomment out the window resize code and you'll see that it doesn't publish the height of the div in the body margin-top. http://jsfiddle.net/spencerthayer/RjdcV/
[10:30:30] <aqeel> spencerthayer: what exactly are you trying to achieve
[10:31:32] <spencerthayer> I need to get the height of the div with the content in it as the browsers is changed and then have it update the margin-top in the body's css.
[10:31:42] <thinkerweb> I wanna make a website for discount price web design Services offering free hosting, templates, apps.  I was hoping you guy would help me brain storm branding; please recommend a domain name for me to purchase.
[10:33:42] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/RjdcV/38/
[10:33:51] <aqeel> this code of yours is working
[10:34:12] <aqeel> click run then resize your browser and scroll to see the size reflection
[10:34:50] <spencerthayer> Oh
[10:34:55] <spencerthayer> Weird!
[10:35:01] <spencerthayer> My bad.
[10:35:09] <aqeel> yes because the reflection is after you resize the window
[10:35:45] <aqeel> you might wanna show initial size and then reflect if there was a window resize
[10:35:46] <spencerthayer> I see.
[10:36:27] <spencerthayer> That's easy enough.
[10:37:13] <spencerthayer> I am sure I can do this a little more elegantly but it is working now, http://jsfiddle.net/spencerthayer/RjdcV/
[10:37:25] <spencerthayer> thanks
[10:38:03] <aqeel> well i might suggest you better do state min, width and min height.......if browser is made to very small size all your contents will get overlaped.....min will force that min position...
[10:39:57] <spencerthayer> Yup. Totally agree.
[11:01:00] <aqeel> shoky thanks...
[11:01:10] <aqeel> nailed the problem..
[11:19:48] <Already> Hi! Maybe someone would've an advice for me? I currently have a base logo which has a lot of transparent pixels. The logo element gets a background-image and i'd like to animate a change for this.Would there be an easy way to do this?
[11:21:32] <Taggnostr> what kind of change?
[11:21:47] <Taggnostr> .show() and .hide() supports some animations iirc
[11:22:24] <Taggnostr> support*
[11:24:03] <Already> A change of the background-image url. It works to just set a new background-image but i'd like to get a softer transition like a fadeIn/fadeOut
[11:27:31] <aqeel> use fadeIN(), fadeOut()
[11:27:38] <aqeel> fadeIn()*
[11:28:37] <aqeel> http://oscarotero.com/jquery/
[11:28:40] <aqeel> see effects...
[11:29:42] <aqeel> http://jqapi.ru/
[11:29:46] <aqeel> this might help too
[11:36:58] <Already> fadeIn and fadeOut won't work as far as i can tell. This is my case, though the images are different, i'd like to get a smoother transition: http://jsfiddle.net/HTSUV/
[11:43:50] <rmurphey> Already: you'll have better results if you put all the animation states into a single sprite
[11:44:19] <rmurphey> and then just change the background position, rather than switching between multiple images
[11:45:11] <rmurphey> you could also use that technique to move through different opacities
[11:45:19] <rmurphey> but you're right that fadeIn and fadeOut isn't going to help you
[11:46:07] <Already> I'd have to have all the opacity levels in the sprit file,r ight? Sounds like a neet idea.
[11:48:01] <shoky> there's also css3 transitions ;p http://jsfiddle.net/HTSUV/2/
[11:48:46] <shoky> doesnt do shit in ff, nvm
[11:51:06] <Already> Nice idea anyway. :)
[11:51:30] <Already> I didn't have a look at CSS3 yet, seems like i should. :D
[11:51:44] <Robik> Hello, I have a question about jquery UI's draggable.
[11:51:57] <Robik> I need to calculate offset by which element was dragged.
[11:52:16] <Robik> I am using 'drag' event but have no idea how to calculate diffrence.
[11:52:36] <Already> For my current problem ... i'm just going to get rid of the transparency and just use fullimages. There are animations for that and it should work.
[11:55:43] <aqeel> why not use gif, it supports animation
[11:55:53] <aqeel> gif was made for this purpose
[11:55:54] <Already> Sorry i never used jq UI Robik
[11:56:19] <aqeel> but gif does not support transparency
[11:57:14] <Already> And gif, at least it had for a while, has a limit number of colors while my images are based on game screenshots.
[11:58:31] <aqeel> It is even easier than that. Put the image files into a folder (with only those pictures). Use File - Import - Folder as frames.

[12:36:51] <k1ng> hi
[12:36:53] <k1ng> http://jsfiddle.net/xMUCK/1/
[12:37:07] <k1ng> how do i load() a html to popup?
[12:37:21] <SmallCode> How can I add an extra variable to a $.POST request?
[12:37:55] <SmallCode> k1ng you would use load, then put loads (data) inside the pop up with $('#popup').html
[12:38:03] <SmallCode> or .append, etc
[12:38:36] <SmallCode> JessC you here?
[12:39:11] <k1ng> http://jsfiddle.net/xMUCK/1/
[12:39:14] <k1ng> SmallCode, ^
[12:39:40] <SmallCode> Woah k1ng
[12:39:42] <SmallCode> What is this?
[12:40:00] <k1ng> a popup?
[12:40:01] <SmallCode> Looks like your mixing native Javascript with jQuery
[12:40:08] <k1ng> i am creating bookmarket
[12:40:09] <SmallCode> And throwing it all together lol
[12:40:11] <shoky> SmallCode: what do you mean, an extra variable?
[12:40:23] <SmallCode> shoky an extra $_POST['...'
[12:40:49] <SmallCode> k1ng
[12:40:50] <shoky> how did you add the non-extra variables..?
[12:40:50] <SmallCode> Okay
[12:40:59] <SmallCode> Its already in the form shoky
[12:41:00] <SmallCode> window.open('url', 'window name', 'window settings');
[12:41:04] <SmallCode> umm k1ng
[12:41:47] <SmallCode> Yes k1ng this isn't the correct way
[12:41:48] <SmallCode> Also
[12:41:54] <k1ng> what
[12:41:55] <SmallCode> I dont think you can manipulate frames
[12:42:15] <k1ng> really?
[12:42:15] <SmallCode> You're trying to manipulate an iframe correct?
[12:42:25] <SmallCode> Or like something that was loaded from another page?
[12:42:33] <SmallCode> You will have to use .live(...)
[12:42:34] <SmallCode> for that
[12:42:44] <shoky> SmallCode: you're submitting a form, or doing an ajax request? or submitting it using ajax and .serialize? or what
[12:42:55] <SmallCode> Because when the page first loads, jQuery is only able to see that DOM, or that html that was orignally written
[12:43:05] <SmallCode> Only live is able to reparse the DOM for new elements on the page
[12:43:20] <SmallCode> But even then, im not sure if you can manipulate a iframe :\ or document.load
[12:43:47] <SmallCode> A way around this would be to have a javascript file on the page your loading
[12:44:03] <SmallCode> and when its called, execute it
[12:44:12] <SmallCode> Shoky
[12:44:15] <SmallCode> Im doing an ajax request
[12:44:33] <SmallCode> But, yes im submitting a form, using the .serialize
[12:45:06] <SmallCode> and i want to add an extra variable onto the form, I know I could do it via <input type="hidden"/> and if needed, I will do it that way, but id rather for it programmatically
[12:45:40] <SmallCode> K1ng did you get what I was saying?
[12:46:03] <k1ng> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost/AddToCart/popup.html. Origin blah is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[12:46:07] <k1ng> forget it
[12:46:19] <SmallCode> Are you using pure AJAX k1ng?
[12:46:36] <SmallCode> Or are you using jQueries ajax helper functions?
[12:47:27] <SmallCode> k1ng to load a page into a divsion called popup do this $('#popup').load('INSERT YOUR URL HERE*******', function() {   alert('Load was performed.'); });
[12:47:40] <SmallCode> And it will load the webpage inside of that #popup
[12:48:06] <SmallCode> Any clue Shoky?
[12:49:04] <k1ng> SmallCode, how are you entering those variables?
[12:49:17] <k1ng> serialize()?
[12:50:17] <SmallCode> For what k1ng?
[12:50:44] <SmallCode> K1ng, download teamviewer.com
[12:50:51] <SmallCode> Ill be more than glad to come on and help you figure out your problem
[12:51:29] <shoky> SmallCode: you can use .serializeArray() and push your extra variables there
[12:51:58] <k1ng> i will just use .write() for now
[12:51:59] <k1ng> forget the load()
[12:51:59] <shoky> e.g. var data = $('form').serializeArray(); data.push({name: 'extra', value: 'lol'});
[12:52:01] <SmallCode> Okay Shoky, but what if my varibales are on a form, then I would have to loop through them correct?
[12:52:07] <SmallCode> Ahh
[12:52:11] <SmallCode> Okay shoky awesome!
[12:52:42] <SmallCode> Okay k1ng, don't give up on yourself, or settle for less
[12:53:04] <k1ng> SmallCode, i dont have much time. i have to deliever this project soon
[12:53:08] <SmallCode> k1ng here is a good resource
[12:53:09] <SmallCode> https://tutsplus.com/course/30-days-to-learn-jquery/
[12:53:20] <k1ng> goddamn it. I am not a n00b
[12:53:22] <k1ng> alright?
[12:53:33] <SmallCode> Well your not even using jquery properly
[12:53:56] <k1ng> i havent used jquery in popup before thats why
[12:54:12] <SmallCode> Yeah, and you can't manipulate a popups DOM without use live ffs
[12:54:18] <SmallCode> using*
[12:54:26] <shoky> live is deprecated
[12:54:50] <SmallCode> Shoky, it is, but it points to the other function
[12:54:58] <SmallCode> then use on live
[12:55:00] <shoky> yes, better to just use the other function
[12:55:10] <SmallCode> Yeah
[12:55:12] <SmallCode> It is
[13:30:11] <ejo> Hmm... I'm grabbing an <li> element from the DOM, cloning it and inserting the clone after it.  This is in an <ol> so Firefox is rendering item numbers.  The numbers for the newly cloned li's are getting rendered inside of them instead of next to 'em!
[13:34:18] <DataLess> I'm looking into performance issues on my javascript/jquery keyboard implementation and curious if there's a difference in response times using either a div or a button.
[13:34:38] <DataLess> I'm currently using a div with a click event
[13:35:03] <shoky> ?demo @ ejo
[13:35:04] <bot-t> ejo, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:35:41] <shoky> DataLess: don't think there's a difference..
[13:36:09] <DataLess> that's what I was thinking, it all has to bind to the same routines
[13:36:36] <ejo> thanks shoky
[13:37:11] <DataLess> i get a slight hesitation when running on ipad but not on raspberry pi
[13:37:57] <DataLess> but am not using jquery_mobile so I don't think there's a built in delay
[13:40:54] <shoky> oh, no idea about mobiles
[13:42:08] <DataLess> it's strange behavior on the ipad - there's an ever so slight delay in response - but it could just be related to processor speed on the ipad
[13:42:23] <DataLess> but, like i said, on the PI there's no issue
[13:47:30] <star_prone> hi
[13:48:20] <star_prone> if I use jquery.form plugin to upload an image via ajax, how can I submit the same form by a normal HTTP request?
[13:49:25] <veQue> is there a jquery on screen calculator i can use for textfields?
[13:53:47] <veQue> looks like i found one https://github.com/Rockncoder/JQMCalculator
[14:51:20] <Satoebbi> hello dear jQuery fans! another question from hungary: http://jsfiddle.net/eapo/43UUP/1/ why toggle() not working in the 1st example?
[14:54:06] <shoky> Satoebbi: both examples are wrong. calling .toggle _adds_ an event handler, and you're calling .toggle on every click..
[14:54:41] <shoky> er
[15:08:49] <raj`> any issue with making each additional script I $.getScript on as a callback?
[15:09:58] <raj`> or is there a better way to do that?
[15:09:58] <shoky> wat? ;p
[15:10:05] <raj`> hey shoky :)
[15:10:10] <shoky> hey dood ;]
[15:12:01] <raj`> I'm loading an html file into a div on my current page, and then I'm loading some js files (they modify the elements in the html file I just loaded)
[15:12:29] <raj`> however, the js files seem to load before the html is loaded into the DOM element
[15:13:47] <shoky> didn't understand the question though
[15:13:51] <shoky> gramatically
[15:13:59] <shoky> mm
[15:21:22] <Satoebbi> http://jsfiddle.net/eapo/43UUP/3/ i want to show/hide the border of the fieldset on togle the fieldset's children('.form_container') i can't figure out how
[15:24:01] <raj`> shoky, so: 1) I'm loading an html file using ajax; 2) I place it in the DOM within a div with the class 'content'; 3) I use a few $.getScript() calls to load the appropriate js files ... there is unstyled content (and other issues) because one of the js files is being loaded before the html file gets placed in the DOM
[15:29:45] <raj`> brb
[15:36:40] <Satoebbi> finaly workin: http://jsfiddle.net/eapo/43UUP/9/
[15:37:48] <shoky> raj`: you load the html into the div, with a .load? and you're doing the $.getScripts on the .load callback?
[15:52:06] <imanc> are there any 'advanced' books on jquery? I've used it for several years, but have never put the effort in to learn it properly.  Though I suspect the answer is to read the jquery online docs and know javascript fully.
[15:55:11] <SmallCode> Using JSON with php, how would I send back the data to jQuery in php, would I just echo the json out?
[15:55:24] <raj`> shoky, I'm using $.ajax({'url':'/somepage', 'success':function(data) {/*put the data into the DOM and then $.getScript() necessary scripts*/}})
[15:55:43] <SmallCode> Raj` whats up
[15:55:56] <raj`> hi
[15:56:05] <SmallCode> Raj` I dont think you use the ' '
[15:56:12] <SmallCode> aroudn success
[15:56:19] <raj`> optional
[15:56:27] <imanc> SmallCode: of course.
[15:56:39] <SmallCode> Okay
[15:56:45] <SmallCode> So what was your question?
[15:57:14] <raj`> SmallCode, scroll up, it's the ordered list
[15:57:30] <SmallCode> so: 1) I'm loading an html file using ajax; 2) I place it in the DOM within a div with the class 'content'; 3) I use a few $.getScript() calls to load the appropriate js files ... there is unstyled content (and other issues)
[15:57:57] <SmallCode> Okay
[15:58:03] <SmallCode> Unstyled content
[15:58:48] <SmallCode> That's weird, are you styling with jquery or is it in actual stylesheet?
[15:58:52] <raj`> not due to css, btw
[15:59:00] <raj`> styling with jquery
[15:59:04] <SmallCode> Okay
[15:59:10] <raj`> making widgets out of things, etc
[15:59:35] <SmallCode> So you have a div, and you loaded inside of it with .ajax
[15:59:55] <SmallCode> What you might want to do is put all that styling inside of a function
[15:59:57] <SmallCode> and then call it
[16:00:15] <SmallCode> or on .success( call it )
[16:00:30] <sunbeam> Hi, I need to have an input field with a rounded corner box as background, inside this box there is some inner shadow
[16:00:33] <sunbeam> Is using background image with a fixed width still the best method in this case?
[16:00:54] <SmallCode> Sunbeam, you can use CSS3, however thats not really a jQuery question
[16:00:58] <raj`> SmallCode, that's what I do
[16:01:17] <SmallCode> Sunbeam look up border-radius and box-shadow: inset
[16:01:26] <raj`> the problem is getScript() is being called before the html file finishes being placed in the DOM
[16:01:37] <SmallCode> Ahh Raj, had the same problem
[16:01:46] <SmallCode> Raj, can I see the source please
[16:01:48] <SmallCode> jsfiddle.net
[16:01:59] <sunbeam> SmallCode: thanks
[16:02:10] <sunbeam> SmallCode: is there a way to have this cross browser working (modern ones)
[16:02:10] <SmallCode> sunbeam no problem
[16:02:21] <SmallCode> Yes look up border-radius css3
[16:02:26] <SmallCode> and box shadow inset css3
[16:02:30] <SmallCode> In google
[16:03:19] <sunbeam> ok
[16:03:28] <SmallCode> Shoky you around?
[16:04:06] <SmallCode> Imanc, check out tutsplus.net some good jQuery content
[16:04:23] <SmallCode> Also the best way to learn is to try and fail
[16:05:57] <sunbeam> SmallCode: hmm i try this inset
[16:06:05] <SmallCode> Yes use inset
[16:06:06] <sunbeam> it works, but how can i have the inset shadow only on top of the box
[16:06:13] <raj`> SmallCode, that's very dependent on whether the html loads fast enough
[16:06:20] <SmallCode> Sunbeam, create a div at the top of the box
[16:06:21] <raj`> an example usually isn't good enough
[16:06:28] <raj`> I just need to make sure things happen in a particular order
[16:06:31] <SmallCode> Raj, do you have teamviewer
[16:06:37] <SmallCode> I can join you and take a look
[16:06:50] <sunbeam> SmallCode: you mean like a absolute positioned?
[16:07:01] <SmallCode> Sunbeam, show me code
[16:07:28] <SmallCode> And no, absolute positioning is outside of the page flow, I don't think thats what you want
[16:07:59] <sunbeam> i'm developing this local but its very simple
[16:08:02] <SmallCode> Absolute positioning is like if you have a piece of paper, and lets pretend that on the page elements are drawn on the paper
[16:08:05] <sunbeam> i have a rounded cornered box
[16:08:20] <sunbeam> of which i want the inner shadow only 2px thick and only -top of the box
[16:08:32] <SmallCode> Absolute positioning is like having another piece of paper ontop of the main piece of paper
[16:08:44] <SmallCode> you can move it and it won't effect anything in the main piece of paper
[16:08:52] <sunbeam> SmallCode: I think I will just use a background image
[16:08:58] <SmallCode> Okay
[16:08:58] <sunbeam> that repeats, will give the same effect
[16:09:03] <SmallCode> Okay
[16:09:08] <raj`> SmallCode, I appreciate the offer! unfortunately, I won't be able to show the actual source
[16:09:11] <sunbeam> (not for the corners but for the inner shadow)
[16:09:33] <raj`> can I ensure an element is inserted into the DOM before running another function?
[16:09:41] <raj`> is there a way to make a callback for the DOM insertion?
[16:09:45] <SmallCode> Hmm yes
[16:09:53] <raj`> I'm using `$('.content').after($content)`
[16:09:58] <SmallCode> Yeah but
[16:10:04] <SmallCode> You need to have it alert
[16:10:12] <SmallCode> Let me try googling
[16:10:32] <SmallCode> Raj` http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3900151/is-there-a-jquery-event-that-fires-when-a-new-node-is-inserted-into-the-dom
[16:10:48] <SmallCode> It requires a plugin
[16:10:56] <SmallCode> But, shouldn't make a difference
[16:11:04] <SmallCode> If it works, it works, simple as that
[16:11:45] <SmallCode> Plugins are for the practical people ha
[16:11:59] <raj`> SmallCode, but I can't just check for any DOM element, I need ALL the DOM elements I added to be fully added
[16:12:18] <SmallCode> Well the page
[16:12:20] <SmallCode> is an element
[16:12:51] <SmallCode> Just throw a div around it all
[16:13:06] <raj`> but what about its internal elements, do they all get added as the parent div gets added to an existent div in the DOM?
[16:14:29] <Satoebbi> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13546984/style-able-collapsible-fieldset-with-jquery
[16:23:43] <pasty> How do I get it so the test div height is auto adjusted for the panels when you click on the numbers http://jsfiddle.net/b7C2d/1/
[16:26:43] <pasty> http://jsfiddle.net/b7C2d/116/
[16:37:13] <sunbeam> Does anyone know a good way to get rounded corners working in IE6-7-8
[16:40:35] <jerkface03> I'd like to be able to upload files through my JQuery Mobile UI, but the form elements for the file upload aren't being stylized properly. Does anyone know how to fix this?
[16:43:10] <tw2113> images sunbeam
[16:43:18] <tw2113> i say fuck'em and just give them square corners
[16:48:14] <tw2113> i think css3pie or whatever does it too, but not worth it
[16:54:20] <kontoo> sunbeam: images
[16:58:59] <raj`> can someone tell me how to ensure my DOM manipulation is complete before any next function call? is livequery the only way?
[17:11:53] <sunbeam> tw2113: thanks
[17:11:59] <sunbeam> css3pie works prety good
[17:12:01] <sunbeam> i mean why not
[17:12:32] <tw2113> you ask why not, i ask why bother
[17:12:39] <tw2113> IE6-7 aren't worth the time any more
[17:16:38] <_zoggy_> need to update topic, its 1.9.2 for jui
[17:16:45] <_zoggy_> ie6 is dropped in 1.10.x
[17:36:02] <SmallCode> Anyone know how to get the length of a json request?
[17:48:44] <shoky> raj: here?
[17:52:02] <raj> hey
[17:52:03] <raj> yeah
[18:12:39] <shoky> yo
[18:14:11] <shoky> so you need to be clearer on what the issue is, cause if you call $.getScript _after_ adding something to the DOM, it'll get called after, synchronously
[18:14:47] <dblosevn> SmallCode: jqXHR.responsetext.length
[18:14:53] <shoky> raj.
[18:14:58] <SmallCode> Thank you dblosevn
[18:15:06] <dblosevn> np
[18:17:08] <dblosevn> SmallCode: sorry its .responseText forgot to camelcase
[18:17:19] <SmallCode> WTF DBLOSEVN
[18:17:22] <SmallCode> I REPLACE 900 LINES OF CODE
[18:17:27] <SmallCode>  with that, AND NOW I AHVE TO DO IT again!!!!
[18:17:29] <SmallCode> Jking lol
[18:17:35] <shoky> raj: the point being, at any moment when your code is running, an element is either in the DOM tree or it isn't..
[18:17:55] <dblosevn> SmallCode: if it took you 900 lines of code to do that you need a job at mcdonalds
[18:18:12] <dblosevn> :)
[18:18:19] <SmallCode> You failed to understand my joke lol
[18:18:33] <shoky> or he tried to one-up yours
[18:18:37] <dblosevn> SmallCode: or I understood it perfectly and you failed rto understand mine
[18:18:38] <Suppa_Spic> why when I show() and hide() an element can't show it again?
[18:18:50] <shoky> Suppa_Spic: you can plz
[18:18:53] <Suppa_Spic> seems like some css I add it's blocking it
[18:19:00] <shoky> that may be
[18:19:09] <SmallCode> Dblosevn, that is very true, or you failed to understand my failure to understand your failure to understand mine
[18:20:06] <shoky> neither of you can make a joke, this we now know
[18:20:13] <dblosevn> SmallCode: be nice to me i just woke up :-)
[18:20:24] <dblosevn> ++shoky
[18:20:24] <SmallCode> What time is it
[18:20:41] <dblosevn> 9:20 pm played black ops 2 till like 1 pm
[18:20:45] <shoky> precisely 4:20 here
[18:21:05] <dblosevn> i knew it was 4:20 somewhere lmao
[18:21:23] <shoky> ;D
[18:21:36] <shoky> i'll get to it, then.
[18:22:22] <dblosevn> shoky: thought you were in the US
[18:22:31] <dblosevn> or HI?
[18:22:34] <shoky> nopers. israel
[18:23:05] <dblosevn> ah tru tru
[18:23:17] <raj> shoky, if I add an alert before running getScript, everything is fine, presumably because it gives jquery more time to throw the div in the DOM
[18:23:35] <shoky> raj: jquery doesnt take time to throw the div in the DOM
[18:23:41] <shoky> not while your script is running
[18:23:49] <dblosevn> raj: depending on the browser eg everything but chrome alerts block js
[18:23:49] <shoky> raj: that's what i meant by synchronously
[18:24:08] <raj> then why does adding a wait or an alert cause there to be no issue?
[18:24:11] <shoky> raj: this is why i asked you to be clearer on what the issue is, you haven't explained it properly
[18:24:22] <raj> ok, let me paste code
[18:24:23] <shoky> an element can't be partially in the DOM
[18:24:30] <shoky> after the call to .after(...)
[18:24:33] <shoky> its in the DOM, period
[18:24:52] <shoky> maybe your script needs some images to be loaded, or is dependent on some other inline script in that html, who knows..
[18:25:32] <dblosevn> shoky: or theres an onready in his script that needs to fire to inject more elements in the dom
[18:26:00] <dblosevn> the script he called with getScript that is
[18:26:08] <shoky> then it's a bad script
[18:26:20] <shoky> and he should fix it :P
[18:26:22] <dblosevn> ive kinda deduced that from this point lol
[18:27:02] <dblosevn> i never have these kinds of problems with my code :-)
[18:27:13] <Suppa_Spic> weird, my show/hide code works perfectly in FF, not in chrome... but a jsfiddle works with chrome, wtf
[18:27:58] <shoky> raj: you've been fiddling with that "conversion to an SPA" so long.. when i rememeber weeks ago people telling you that you should just re-do it
[18:28:13] <shoky> re-do the architecture
[18:29:56] <YammYcoding> hi. I added this line: $(document).ready(function() {$('select[name=page_id]').attr('value','6');});  and js errors saying $ is not a function. But jquery.js is beeing loaded. What could be?
[18:30:03] <shoky> Suppa_Spic: that's usually when you share the link to the fiddle
[18:30:22] <Suppa_Spic> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/JkTMX/
[18:30:22] <dblosevn> shoky++
[18:31:03] <Suppa_Spic> I mean, that jsfiddle works as expected in chrome, but when I run it on my page, doesnt work, but if I run the same page on FF runs OK...
[18:31:38] <dblosevn> Suppa_Spic: that usually sugests its not a problem with this code, its a problem somewhere else in your page
[18:31:49] <Suppa_Spic> dblosevn: yes, but then why works with FF?
[18:32:02] <Suppa_Spic> :/
[18:32:09] <dblosevn> Suppa_Spic: because firefox uses a different rendering engine
[18:32:15] <Suppa_Spic> well yeah..
[18:32:30] <dblosevn> and it may be more forgiving then chrome in this instance
[18:32:43] <shoky> Suppa_Spic: what's not working?
[18:33:00] <shoky> i'm getting it to show and hide just fine..
[18:33:03] <shoky> in chrome
[18:33:14] <Suppa_Spic> shoky: I show the second <select> then hide it, but when I try to show it again Chrome adds a 0x0 element
[18:33:17] <dblosevn> ya ut when he adds his template around it it no longer shows and hides
[18:33:39] <dblosevn> *but when
[18:33:42] <shoky> huh
[18:33:56] <shoky> what template
[18:34:04] <dblosevn> Well his page code whatever
[18:34:14] <dblosevn> it works by itself but not in the page
[18:34:32] <shoky> er not really sure what y'all are talking about ;p
[18:34:43] <shoky> and what 0x0 element
[18:34:55] <shoky> i choose Si, the second select shows up
[18:34:58] <Suppa_Spic> the same element, but with no widht/height
[18:35:02] <shoky> i choose - , then it hides
[18:35:06] <shoky> i do that again, it does it again
[18:35:22] <Suppa_Spic> shoky: yes, that's ok, lemme c if I can upload this page somewhere
[18:35:40] <dblosevn> he clearly said it works in fiddle just not in the context of his page, so we really need to see it in that context to give him an answer
[18:35:50] <shoky> oh i didn't see that line
[18:36:09] <dblosevn> :-)
[18:36:10] <shoky> sry, misread
[18:36:19] <YammYcoding> so, what's is it when javascript errors saying $ and jquery are not a function, but the jquery is loaded?
[18:36:38] <shoky> YammYcoding: when you try jQuery instead of $ does it work?
[18:36:54] <YammYcoding> no, both errors
[18:36:57] <tw2113> YammYcoding, also make sure the library is loaded before you try to use it
[18:37:02] <dblosevn> YammYcoding: usually you tried to use jQuery before you loaded it
[18:37:08] <YammYcoding> it's loaded in head, and the script is after that
[18:37:15] <Suppa_Spic> uploading..
[18:37:25] <shoky> YammYcoding: give a link..
[18:37:28] <YammYcoding> ah the script is inside body somewhere, does it make a difference?
[18:37:42] <YammYcoding> maybe jquery didnt ended loading yet ?
[18:37:56] <shoky> thats fine, i think
[18:38:12] <YammYcoding> hmm what could I do to workaround that?
[18:38:18] <YammYcoding> set a timer ?
[18:38:19] <dblosevn> if you loaded jquery in the head and didnt set asyn to true then no jquery should be loaded by the time it starts parsing the body
[18:38:32] <dblosevn> *async
[18:38:40] <YammYcoding> how i see if async is true?
[18:38:48] <dblosevn> you would have had to set that manually
[18:38:56] <shoky> YammYcoding: it's not something to workaround.. it's something to fix right away
[18:39:06] <YammYcoding> it's some code inside wordpress so I duno how it is set deeply
[18:39:14] <dblosevn> <script type="text/javascript" src="..." async="true"
[18:39:21] <YammYcoding> aah lemesee
[18:39:36] <Suppa_Spic> I sent you a link shoky
[18:39:52] <YammYcoding> the assync should be on the jquery call or on my script call?
[18:40:13] <dblosevn> it shouldnt e there at all
[18:40:23] <dblosevn> *be whats wrong with my keyboard
[18:40:41] <YammYcoding> haha
[18:40:50] <YammYcoding> well there is no async anywhere
[18:41:09] <dblosevn> Suppa_Spic: works great in chrome for me, dont pm me without asking
[18:41:11] <tw2113> admin or frontend YammYcoding ?
[18:41:12] <YammYcoding> it does works on my friend clean wp install.i get no clue
[18:41:15] <YammYcoding> front
[18:41:16] <Suppa_Spic> dblosevn: sorry about that
[18:41:23] <raj> wait, shoky, so the issue is that the .getScript() files that I get have all the code within $(function(){})?
[18:41:39] <raj> in the retrieved js files
[18:41:40] <YammYcoding> can i put any timer to call my function when jquery gets loaded?
[18:41:44] <Suppa_Spic> well, maybe my chrome is broken or some extension is doing something :/
[18:42:38] <tw2113> is it not wrapped in jQuery(document).ready( function() { });
[18:43:00] <dblosevn> Suppa_Spic: im using Version 23.0.1271.64 m
[18:43:15] <Suppa_Spic> Version 23.0.1271.64 m
[18:43:16] <Suppa_Spic> same :/
[18:44:08] <dblosevn> Suppa_Spic: now it doesnt work
[18:44:17] <dblosevn> Suppa_Spic: worked the first time but not after
[18:44:20] <Suppa_Spic> dblosevn: ? I didnt make any change
[18:44:34] <dblosevn> Suppa_Spic: i didnt reload the page
[18:44:45] <Suppa_Spic> dblosevn: well see, that's the problem lol
[18:44:56] <dblosevn> Suppa_Spic: only works the first time you select an option
[18:44:59] <Suppa_Spic> yes
[18:45:03] <YammYcoding> is that a correct code? jQuery(document).ready(function() { jQuery('select[name=page_id]').attr('value','6'); } );
[18:45:27] <Suppa_Spic> on FF works correctly, and jsfiddle with Chrome too, but not the page directly :/
[18:47:49] <shoky> raj: i have no idea what the issue is, because you're keeping it a secret as usual :)
[18:49:06] <dblosevn> Suppa_Spic: it doesnt like the .css call
[18:49:24] <Suppa_Spic> yes, I noticed that too
[18:49:31] <Suppa_Spic> without the css thing works ok
[18:49:52] <Suppa_Spic> BUT if I apply those css to my stylesheet doesnt work either
[18:49:54] <dblosevn> Suppa_Spic: you should add that css to in a stylesheet
[18:50:08] <Suppa_Spic> dblosevn: didnt work either
[18:50:14] <dblosevn> it shows fine if i set a breakpoint before the css call
[18:50:33] <Suppa_Spic> well lemme try again with the stylesheet
[18:51:03] <dblosevn> its this breaking it float':'','margin-right':'
[18:51:31] <shoky> Suppa_Spic: it's a weird issue, but it's probably got to do with the weird html
[18:51:43] <shoky> you're mixing inline and block elements next to each other
[18:51:56] <shoky> you got that label, input, label, textarea on top
[18:52:09] <Suppa_Spic> hmm
[18:52:18] <shoky> and then after those you put <div>s with float:left
[18:52:25] <shoky> it's not.. well-structured, i dono
[18:52:29] <dblosevn> Suppa_Spic: I would just leave the float: left and marign on the select if its hidden so will its margin
[18:53:10] <Suppa_Spic> Ok I'm going to try that
[18:53:11] <shoky> Suppa_Spic: that whole row of <div>s with float:left should all be in a containing <div>
[18:53:49] <shoky> Suppa_Spic: also, why are you removing float:left when hiding the div?
[18:54:23] <Suppa_Spic> shoky: it was part of the test
[18:54:30] <shoky> k
[18:55:40] <shoky> YammYcoding: that would probably work but better to do .val('6')
[18:57:33] <Suppa_Spic> shoky: thank you, got it working, was what you said
[18:57:46] <Suppa_Spic> I just put the above elements inside divs
[18:57:49] <shoky> sweet
[19:05:41] <sexyshape> I am experiencing freezes with jquery-ui modal dialog, moving it around. Do you have the same ?
[19:06:07] <shoky> no
[19:07:26] <sexyshape> hmm
[19:09:10] <raj> shoky, here we go: this is _base.js that's loaded when the site is visited http://jsfiddle.net/svWgN/
[19:09:14] <sexyshape> I mean, I click on the top bar then move it fast right left top down, and every, two to ten seconds, there's a one second freeze
[19:09:30] <raj> this is _newsite.js http://paste.ofcode.org/34kKfKV6qCQ75QUiwMqQ6d2
[19:19:44] <raj> shoky, that's all the relevant code
[19:34:57] <shoky> raj: ahh
[19:35:26] <shoky> raj: why is that code in the success handler, inside  a $(...) ?
[19:35:49] <raj> not sure
[19:35:51] <raj> is that the issue?
[19:36:05] <shoky> raj: and why is the .getScript not inside the $(...) too
[19:36:20] <raj> oh, I think it used to be
[19:36:45] <shoky> raj: and still, you havent said what the issue really is
[19:37:12] <raj> build() doesn't end up altering the  elements
[19:38:20] <shoky> do those elements that you're calling build() on exist in the html that you added to the DOM?
[19:38:30] <raj> yes
[19:39:32] <shoky> as first line in build() , put :  console.log('build', someclass, $(someclass), $(someclass).length);
[19:39:39] <shoky> and tell me what it says..
[19:40:20] <shoky> also , what makes you say that it "doesnt end up altering the elements"?
[19:41:14] <raj> because it's supposed to add checkboxes next to each item in an unordered list
[19:41:48] <shoky> see.. more stuff you're hiding ;)
[19:42:31] <shoky> just give me a live link in PM and be done with it ;)
[19:43:13] <shoky> or, use console.log in strategic places to see what's being called , when, with what arguments, etc...
[19:43:26] <karisma> can someone send me a pm? My irc client is acting up, and want to check it's working.
[19:43:45] <shoky> and check if selectors are actually selecting anything (e.g. console.log the .length)
[19:44:00] <shoky> karisma: pm'd you
[19:44:11] <karisma> shoky: thanks
[19:44:46] <raj> after adding that console.log, it started working
[19:44:48] <raj> that's weird
[19:44:50] <raj> and now I removed it
[19:44:53] <raj> and it still works
[19:44:56] <shoky> ;]
[19:45:01] <raj> so clearly unstable :T
[19:45:28] <shoky> why all those $(...)
[19:45:39] <shoky> the DOM has been ready for a long time already
[19:45:53] <raj> k
[19:47:04] <shoky> btw, those 3 scripts you're .getScript'ing need to be run in that order?
[19:52:10] <raj> shoky, yes
[19:52:28] <raj> should they be callbacks to each other? although I'm not getting any js errors
[19:52:47] <shoky> yeah they should, if its important
[19:53:10] <shoky> (or better yet they should be concatenated into 1 file)
[19:53:28] <shoky> or best yet , stop getScripting
[19:53:35] <shoky> load all these scripts on page load
[19:53:47] <shoky> but have them not do anything on load, or on DOM ready
[19:53:52] <shoky> they should jsut declare functions
[19:53:57] <shoky> and then... call those functions whenever you desire
[19:54:11] <raj> yeah, that would be ideal
[19:54:18] <shoky> you'd only want these getScripts if you had big scripts..
[19:54:21] <shoky> and you wanted to optimize
[19:54:26] <raj> i considered that multiple times, but it's such a feat to go through soooooo much code
[19:54:55] <shoky> and the past few weeks of you asking the same question have been what?
[19:55:02] <raj> lmao
[19:55:03] <raj> very true
[19:55:04] <shoky> DO IT, MAN.
[19:55:56] <systemfault> If you have a lot of scripts, you might want to consider an AMD loader… or at least a build tool (Like grunt)
[19:56:19] <shoky> dat too
[19:56:37] <shoky> and, hey systemfault
[19:56:42] <systemfault> Hey :)
[19:56:50] <shoky> ;]
[20:02:17] <SmallCode> shoky
[20:02:19] <SmallCode> You here?
[20:02:25] <shoky> SmallCode: hy
[20:02:35] <SmallCode> This is kind of ironic
[20:02:46] <shoky> isn't it
[20:02:48] <SmallCode> Okay so I have a page that is loaded inside of #login_box
[20:03:00] <SmallCode> And I want to be able
[20:03:03] <SmallCode> to manipulate its dom
[20:03:04] <raj> actually, shoky, separating the code that manipulates the DOM is basically what I'm doing now
[20:03:09] <shoky> not sure what that means, SmallCode
[20:03:10] <SmallCode> Lol raj
[20:03:13] <SmallCode> Are you doing the same thing as me
[20:03:14] <raj> I'm trying to load that particular js now
[20:03:19] <raj> which is what I'm having torulb eiwth
[20:03:26] <SmallCode> I want to dynamically manipulate
[20:03:34] <SmallCode> a loaded dom
[20:03:40] <shoky> SmallCode: you can manipulate anything that's in the dOM, when it's in the dom :P
[20:03:49] <SmallCode> But
[20:03:53] <SmallCode> It's loaded with ajax
[20:04:03] <SmallCode> And I have a e.preventDefault on a submit button
[20:04:08] <shoky> so manipulate it after it's loaded and added to the dom
[20:04:12] <SmallCode> thats inside of form
[20:04:29] <SmallCode> I mean the custom divsion thats loaded in, there is a button, and I have event handler on it
[20:04:47] <shoky> for events, you can use event delegation
[20:04:47] <raj> shoky, but that's what I'm doing by doing .after() and then doing .getScript()
[20:05:21] <shoky> raj: right.. but you're fuzzy as to what is actually happening :P
[20:05:38] <shoky> and what your code is REALLY doing..
[20:05:54] <raj> It looks straight forward though
[20:06:15] <shoky> you were talking about checkboxes and whatnot
[20:06:16] <SmallCode> Shoky, how exactly do I do that again
[20:06:24] <shoky> while your code shows 'someclass' and 'someplugin'
[20:06:28] <raj> shoky, btw, after I removed the $(function()) in the success handler, it came back to the same issue of the plugin not able to run on the DOM, until I add a random console.log()
[20:06:37] <shoky> raj: so how am i supposed to understand the issue
[20:07:26] <shoky> SmallCode:  $('#someStaticContainer').on('submit', '.formClass', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); ... });
[20:07:45] <shoky> see ?on
[20:07:45] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[20:08:48] <shoky> raj: "plugin not able to run on the DOM" doesnt help
[20:08:52] <SmallCode> Okay thanks
[20:09:02] <raj> someplugin just converts ul to checkboxes, someclass is build('.content.newsite #stuff-container')
[20:09:21] <raj> cuz the dom doesn't exist at the time
[20:09:33] <shoky> but you say you added the right elements
[20:09:35] <raj> but if I add the console.log, as you suggested, it miraculously works
[20:09:40] <shoky> what makes you say it doesn't exist
[20:09:54] <shoky> (as opposed to 'the plugin isnt doing anything')
[20:09:55] <SmallCode> Shoky
[20:09:55] <raj> just cuz it leaves it as an ul
[20:09:56] <SmallCode> ;)
[20:10:04] * SmallCode votes Shoky best jQuery helper
[20:10:12] <shoky> ;p
[20:10:31] <SmallCode> Shoky you good with php?
[20:10:35] <raj> +1
[20:10:35] <shoky> SmallCode: nope
[20:10:38] <SmallCode> I am
[20:10:42] <SmallCode> If you need help let me know
[20:10:45] <raj> @ this guy
[20:10:46] <shoky> thanks
[20:11:03] <SmallCode> Raj watcha up to
[20:11:18] <raj> programming :)
[20:11:27] <SmallCode> Whats the problamo?
[20:12:08] <raj> same as before
[20:12:14] <SmallCode> Real quick summary
[20:12:15] <SmallCode> I been afk
[20:12:23] <raj> same thing you were trying to answer earlier
[20:12:31] <SmallCode> I forgot
[20:12:36] <SmallCode> Were you the one
[20:12:39] <SmallCode> with the dynamic loading
[20:12:40] <SmallCode> ?
[20:12:45] <raj> exactly
[20:12:50] <shoky> "something isn't working with his code" pretty much sums it up
[20:12:56] <shoky> from what he's revealed to us
[20:12:59] <shoky> ;P
[20:13:23] <SmallCode> Show me some code
[20:13:25] <shoky> raj y no link
[20:13:47] <shoky> y u so secret
[20:13:47] <b-ot> (屮'Д')屮
[20:14:14] <raj> ohh, because it's nearly done at this point
[20:14:32] <raj> I'm just trying to finish this thing off, while managing a fever
[20:14:50] <shoky> raj: paste what exactly you're putting in the DOM with that .after($content)
[20:14:54] <SmallCode> Lol b-ot
[20:14:57] <SmallCode> y u so secret
[20:14:57] <b-ot> (屮'Д')屮
[20:15:02] <SmallCode> Haha b-ot STFU
[20:15:10] <shoky> raj:  paste the output of console.log($content.html())
[20:15:28] <SmallCode> shoky he thinks we might steal his code
[20:15:32] <SmallCode> and use it on another site
[20:15:52] <raj> actually waiting to share this code with shoky
[20:15:54] <shoky> yea but i asked cuz he used to gimme links in PM
[20:16:16] <shoky> to his esoteric test pages ;)
[20:18:10] <shoky> raj: also, are you intentionally adding more .content elements to the DOM? so that next time you call $('.content') there might be more than one ?
[20:19:07] <SmallCode> lol
[20:19:12] <SmallCode> raj
[20:19:15] <SmallCode> What are u working on
[20:19:15] <shoky> raj: and maybe thats the prob..?
[20:19:16] <raj> so that it takes on the css of the old #content, which I switched to .content in the css as well
[20:19:32] <SmallCode> next facebook?
[20:19:38] <raj> SmallCode, of course
[20:19:54] <shoky> raj: you're doing  $('.content').after( <an element with .content> )
[20:20:04] <shoky> after that runs, there is one more .content element in the DOM
[20:20:26] <shoky> is that what you want?
[20:20:34] <raj> yeah
[20:20:45] <shoky> do the selectors in the scripts take it into consideration?
[20:20:56] <raj> yep
[20:20:59] <SmallCode> Raj
[20:20:59] <shoky> oks
[20:21:02] <SmallCode> Ill show you my code
[20:21:05] <SmallCode> If you show me yours
[20:21:34] <raj> i don't swing that way, but i'm flattered at the offer
[20:21:38] <raj> =P
[20:23:12] <TrueColors> Lets say I have... $("li").live('click', function() { ... }); how can I determine which li was clicked in the parent element, for instance was it the first, second, third... and so forth
[20:23:36] <shoky> TrueColors: $(this).index()
[20:23:38] <systemfault> TrueColors: The "this"?
[20:23:53] <systemfault> Also… use .on, it's sexier
[20:24:09] <shoky> this is true
[20:24:14] <systemfault> Women love guys who use .on instead of .live
[20:24:35] <TrueColors> I typically needed .index() + 1 but yes, it does the job, thank you.
[20:24:57] <TrueColors> what is the difference between .on and .live?
[20:25:29] <shoky> .live is deprecated and is now just a shortcut to a form of .on that does event delegation
[20:25:29] <b-ot> shoky, Info: http://pxlz.org/tZ Code: http://pxlz.org/ua
[20:25:37] <shoky> b-ot: fu
[20:26:05] <GNUHerd> I am not trying to be mean, to you or anyone involved with JQuery.
[20:26:06] <systemfault> TrueColors: .live is the "old" way, seems the jquery devs were tired of having 3 different functions to bind events… so they created .on which does everything .live/.bind/.delegate did
[20:26:16] <shoky> GNUHerd: prove it
[20:26:17] <GNUHerd> But PEOPLE DIED when a software error crashed Air France 447.
[20:26:35] <shoky> well, that was jquery 1.0.2 so..
[20:26:36] <GNUHerd> And as much as I recognize you have done nothing to me, I know the right thing is to speak up.
[20:26:49] <GNUHerd> Even though I see the right thing to do is hurtful to others, I will not allow myself to compromise on my principles.
[20:26:49] <shoky> they should upgrade their jquery
[20:26:57] <GNUHerd> Read these in order.
[20:26:59] <GNUHerd> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/jquery/+bug/528600
[20:27:01] <TrueColors> So will the three of them become deprecated at some point, systemfault ?
[20:27:04] <GNUHerd> http://bugs.jquery.com/
[20:27:11] <systemfault> TrueColors: Probably.
[20:28:10] <TrueColors> Ok well I've changed to .on ;)
[20:29:07] <systemfault> TrueColors: You must use the second form of .on
[20:29:15] <systemfault> TrueColors: Or else, it won'twork
[20:29:43] <systemfault> $(document).on(eventType, selector, handler)
[20:30:34] <TrueColors> I just replaced .live with .on and didn't change the params, and it works fine.
[20:30:37] <panaggio> can anyone help me with a cors issue? I'm very, very lost =( http://pastebin.com/KRB8Az4S
[20:31:04] <shoky> TrueColors: then you didn't really need .live
[20:31:21] <shoky> TrueColors: or, it'll stop working if you dynamically add more <li>s
[20:31:48] <TrueColors> OH YEAH Good point, I don't dynamically att them... I just print them out using php. my bad.
[20:32:14] <shoky> then you can just do .on('click', function..)  or use the shortcut  .click(function..)
[20:34:00] <shoky> panaggio: if im not mistaken, the fact that you managed to send the POST request means CORS is working
[20:34:33] <panaggio> shoky: so I don't get what's wrong =(
[20:34:41] <shoky> that is, the browser recognized that the server sent the CORS headers, and it allowed you to send the POST
[20:34:49] <shoky> but then, the server responded with a 401
[20:34:56] <shoky> so you need to see what's up with the server.. i think
[20:35:17] <systemfault> I think shoky is right, CORS worked… the authentication itself went wrong.
[20:39:20] <panaggio> the server is mine, is fake code, just to get the client code running
[20:39:38] <panaggio> the bug is probably on my js
[20:40:59] <systemfault> Perhaps your framework does a bit of magic behind the scene… I'm looking at that CSRF token
[20:41:09] <systemfault> reference in the headers
[20:41:52] <panaggio> nothing, I've sent it by hand. I'm using Mojolicious::Lite, and addind those headers by hand
[20:43:06] <panaggio> http://pastebin.com/Bd94Gz3L
[20:43:09] <TrueColors> Woop woop. http://pastecan.com/v/y3XF clicking on a line will modify the hash accordingly. I love it.
[20:43:10] <panaggio> the js code
[20:44:03] <systemfault> panaggio: you're not sending json to the server.
[20:45:20] <systemfault> It sends x-www-form-urlencoded by default.
[20:47:07] <shoky> TrueColors: if you're gonna have many li's , you should use event delegation, for better performance. e.g.  $('.content').on('click', 'pre li', function() { .. })
[20:47:44] <shoky> TrueColors: that way you're only setting up one event handler. the way you have it now you'd be setting up an event handler for each row
[20:48:35] <TrueColors> Ok shoky, I'll modify that.
[20:50:41] <shoky> systemfault: but he changed the contentType, no?
[20:51:02] <shoky> oh, but he'd need to JSON.stringify it?
[20:51:08] <systemfault> shoky: Yeah
[20:51:11] <panaggio> systemfault: don't get it. Isn't changing contentType enough?
[20:51:39] <systemfault> panaggio: jquery doesn't stringify what you pass to data
[20:51:52] <systemfault> err JSON.stringify
[20:53:40] <TrueColors> shoky what do you think of the site anyway? It's rather basic ... and does significantly less than pastebin, some people may see that as a good thing where as others may not, personally I like it better than pastebin
[20:54:12] <systemfault> panaggio: I'm a fan of jsfiddle.net :P
[20:54:24] <systemfault> But that pastecan website is better than pastebin
[20:55:21] <TrueColors> thank you systemfault :P jsfiddle is rather sexy, but it's not really a pastebin type of ordeal.
[20:55:29] <TrueColors> What's good about it, systemfault ?
[20:55:31] <shoky> TrueColors: looks nice. but then, so do a hundred others ;p
[20:55:42] <systemfault> TrueColors: It's a "live" pastebin
[20:55:57] <systemfault> TrueColors: for PHP.. you could take a look at ideone
[20:56:18] <systemfault> TrueColors: http://ideone.com/kZFm0S
[20:56:38] <TrueColors> shoky indeed, I'm actually proud of myself. I've been working on tens of projects, and not one has been completed but pastecan ... sure I'm still working on it but it is complete.
[20:56:53] <shoky> TrueColors: plz make it remember that i am human ;]
[20:57:00] <shoky> at least for the next.. 5 pastes or someshit
[20:57:10] <systemfault> Or codepad.org… http://codepad.org/hJYibtJR
[20:57:20] <TrueColors> instead of prompting you to answer the captcha each time, shoky ?
[20:57:32] <shoky> yea, thats a turnoff for me :P
[20:58:08] <shoky> but i do see it more and more in others so , whatever
[20:58:09] <TrueColors> systemfault: aye, I haven't heard if ideone before. I usually use viper-7, codepad.org tends to fail when it comes to regex - big style.
[20:58:28] <TrueColors> shoky: it would be nice to have a spam detection but not sure how I'd go about doing that.
[20:58:54] <TrueColors> but I suppose I could add in a cookie... and ignore the captcha whilst the cookie is set, shoky ... perhaps.
[20:59:33] <TrueColors> but anyway, this is majorly off topic. My question was answered so I'll not turn this into a php channel. :)
[21:00:40] <shoky> ;p
[21:01:22] <systemfault> :P
[21:01:55] <systemfault> I used to be a PHP hater.. now I'm just a "PHP programmer" hater
[21:03:43] <TrueColors> systemfault: what language did you prefer in terms of server side?
[21:04:55] <systemfault> TrueColors: I still use PHP most of the time… can't say I love the language.
[21:05:26] <systemfault> (All shops where I work(ed) use PHP)
[21:05:38] <systemfault> I also written backends in Java
[21:05:46] <TrueColors> PHP is easy to grasp in my opinion, some other languages are not (but they do look pretty)
[21:05:57] <systemfault> TrueColors: That's its main problem… IMHO
[21:06:21] <TrueColors> I think shoky should respond to my pm
[21:06:22] <systemfault> TrueColors: That "easy to grasp" language makes shit programmers.
[21:06:38] <shoky> TrueColors: i did
[21:07:05] <TrueColors> Oh shit shoky, I completely forgot LOL.. I didn't even remember sending a message :/
[21:07:12] <shoky> lolwat
[21:07:40] <TrueColors> systemfault: aye, I can imagine.
[21:07:50] <systemfault> Most PHP programmers I've worked with are not really programmers… they don't know what they're doing, they know nothing about OOP/design/architecture… They're a bunch of bad code hackers/copypaste programmers/guesscoder.
[21:08:12] <shoky> cuties
[21:09:09] <TrueColors> lol. we were all "guesscoders" at one point. OOP isn't my strong point - I love it though.
[21:09:36] <TrueColors> if I find someone who copies and pastes I end up bitching at them. You never remember things if you c&p
[21:09:54] <systemfault> TrueColors: Sure… but when I was guesscoding, I had never worked for a company..
[21:10:16] <systemfault> I've seen people parsing JSON with fucking regexes...
[21:10:25] * systemfault facepalms
[21:11:03] <TrueColors> systemfault: I guess it depends on your own opinion of your skills. For me, yeah I can code the majority of things with sometimes having to resort to manuals and help chats, but I wouldn't even work for a company - I don't feel like my skills are good enough.
[21:11:07] <TrueColors> what? that is pathetic.
[21:11:42] <tw2113> TrueColors, i am starting to appreciate the ability to extend classes
[21:11:44] <systemfault> TrueColors: I used to always feel that I was incompetent..
[21:11:49] <panaggio> feels like my js code is working now. finally
[21:11:53] <panaggio> thanks you all
[21:11:56] <TrueColors> $.parseJSON("json string here"); in jquery or json_decode in php ... hell it doesn't take a genius to google that one.
[21:12:11] <TrueColors> panaggio: does it feel like it, or does it actually work? ;)
[21:12:20] <panaggio> now my issues are with mojolicious =/ not quite the same help there =/
[21:12:23] <systemfault> TrueColors: So I kept improving my skills… until my confidence was high enough I could try to get a job in the field.
[21:12:25] <phonebook_> hi jquery i most humbely ask why mouseleave is bubbling up when it isnt supposed to fire unless you exit the element it is bound to
[21:12:58] <panaggio> TrueColors: I'll just know but the time the api is working. by now it won't get the json I'm sending to it =/
[21:13:48] <TrueColors> systemfault: aye, that's the best way to go about it. I don't think I'll ever reach that point though, I'm such a perfectionist and I end up rewriting my projects thousands of times ... then give up. I'm surprised pastecan.com has made it if I'm honest.
[21:14:06] <systemfault> TrueColors: I'm also like that...
[21:14:22] <systemfault> TrueColors: I never actually finished one of my personal projects...
[21:14:28] <systemfault> TrueColors: I keep restarting them...
[21:14:32] <TrueColors> but I plan on putting ads on it, every $1 I make, will go towards buying a house for my mother. Will take a long time if all I rely on are ads but it's something and I'm sure it'll be appreciated.
[21:14:55] <systemfault> TrueColors: Do you work as a web dev?
[21:15:08] <Guest21584> isnt perfectionism and php kind of antipodal?
[21:15:30] <phonebook_> if it works a single time you are supposed to push it
[21:15:56] <TrueColors> systemfault: I do it full time, but it isn't an actual job. I'm unemployed. I've tried volunteering for an anti-bullying organization, but in the web design position. Taking pressure of that, plus all my psychological issues ... it makes things stressful and I end up telling them to f off.
[21:15:57] <systemfault> Guest21584: Well.. you can sculpt a replica of the statue of David in shit...
[21:16:07] <Guest21584> but its still shit
[21:16:08] <Guest21584> ;)
[21:16:11] <systemfault> Guest21584: Exactly.
[21:16:47] <systemfault> TrueColors: For the moment, keep doing jobs for your portfolio then
[21:16:47] <grafi> i've never once looked at php and thought "yeah, thats art"
[21:16:48] <grafi> ^^
[21:17:13] <phonebook_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CHEnJ7gnc
[21:17:49] <systemfault> phonebook_: Hmm.. why?
[21:18:07] <systemfault> Coolz.. a french disclaimer at the beginning
[21:18:20] <TrueColors> systemfault: aye, I sometimes charge people if they want me to do something for them, but it's only little things that cost $5-10, so not even an hours work but so far my portfolio ... once I set up my personal site will contain only pastecan haha.
[21:18:44] <systemfault> TrueColors: I don't even have a personal website :/
[21:18:58] <TrueColors> I do systemfault it's one of my projects that haven't yet made it.
[21:19:01] <systemfault> TrueColors: I bought the domain… a few years ago but never actually put anything on it
[21:19:07] <systemfault> Same for me..
[21:19:13] <TrueColors> We are brothers!
[21:19:15] <phonebook_> push IT... you know
[21:19:31] <grafi> seems like you two need a motivation coach :P
[21:19:49] <systemfault> phonebook_: I prefer the classic song.. I'm only happy when it rains
[21:19:56] <TrueColors> I don't have the motivation to even catch a motivation coach
[21:20:01] <phonebook_> that does make way more sense
[21:20:13] <systemfault> grafi: I don't have that problem when I program at work...
[21:20:29] <systemfault> Money is the motivation to finish projects..
[21:20:35] <grafi> hm
[21:20:39] <systemfault> For my personal ones, learning is the motivation...
[21:20:58] <grafi> but how do you keep learning when doing the same thing over and over?
[21:21:02] <phonebook_> systemfault, i am having some trouble with mouseleave firing on mouseout of descendants elements..... cannot figure it out
[21:21:09] <systemfault> So once I'm done learning everything I can from a personal project.. I try something else.
[21:21:27] <grafi> so you have a ton of unfinished work?
[21:21:29] <systemfault> grafi: You could be surprised at how much you can learn rewriting things.
[21:21:38] <TrueColors> I do the same systemfault but ... eventually I get fed up of something more advanced, so I go back to a more unadvanced project of mine. :P
[21:21:40] <grafi> nothing surprises me anymore ^^
[21:21:41] <systemfault> grafi: Yeah… a ton :(
[21:21:42] <shoky> mouseleave firing on mouseout? wat?
[21:21:45] <grafi> especially not old code
[21:21:46] <grafi> D
[21:23:37] <shoky> g'night
[21:23:47] <phonebook_> yeah so i thought mouseout fired every time the mouse went out even of descendant elements. and mouseleave only fired when the mouse left the element that mouseleave was bound to. but mouseleave is firing inside the element it is bound to
[21:24:06] <systemfault> shoky: Good nigh
[21:24:07] <systemfault> t
[21:27:29] <SmallCode> Shoky
[21:27:33] <SmallCode> You leaving
[21:28:09] <SmallCode> Welcome to my city
[22:23:32] <TrueColors> 744 nicks. can't wait to see 1000 if it ever happens
[22:31:53] <tripflex> how can i redo this code to use live data from php
[22:31:54] <tripflex> http://code.exacttarget.com/code-examples/datagrid.html
[22:36:29] <rohanrhu> hi
[22:36:52] <rohanrhu> jquery's .next() cant find next 'div'
[22:42:07] <vladikoff> ?paste @ rohanrhu
[22:42:07] <bot-t> rohanrhu, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:06:18] <raj> does History.js have a way to get the 'abc' in this url? `http://www.blabla.com/abc?something=bla`
[23:06:55] <raj> I keep getting `abc?something=bla` with History.getState().hash
[23:28:20] <thinkerweb> I made a website using jquery ui, and it works great with desktops, and its easy and fast to type up but it does run well on my Android device
[23:28:37] <thinkerweb> jquery mobile is great on mobile though so far, and I didn't do much
[23:48:22] <vladikoff> thinkerweb, good
