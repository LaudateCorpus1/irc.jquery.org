[00:29:41] <ivoivano> hello
[00:31:19] <dan2k3k4> so I have this inside my animate() -> setTimeout(animate(), 10); BUT I want some parts of the animate code to only run every 1000
[00:31:26] <dan2k3k4> how can I getTimeout ?
[00:34:23] <ryez> is it possible to get a handle to an existing click handler registered to a button?
[00:35:10] <ryez> I wish the $('#btn').unbind('click') return that handle/reference
[00:38:56] <NovemberRain> Hi!
[01:25:58] <dan2k3k4> used timer = new Date().geTime() then if(timer % 2000 === 0) for when I want to fire things every 2 seconds
[01:26:23] <dan2k3k4> now I need to change the background gradient
[01:26:42] <dan2k3k4> but for all browsers :/ and .css() only works for one at a time?
[01:27:11] <firos> Hello! I must ask for a little bit of help. This returns typeerror, getType is not defined. Why? I can't for the life of me find an answer http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=YCgAwxHe
[01:33:08] <Cork> dan2k3k4: .css({ }) ?
[01:33:20] <edoop> in your humble opinion can i register github  account for my experiment?
[01:33:37] <dan2k3k4> Cork: yes but if I do multiple "background" for each prefix (-webket, -moz etc.)
[01:33:40] <dan2k3k4> kit*
[01:33:49] <Cork> dan2k3k4: you can't
[01:33:55] <Cork> you need to find the prefix to use
[01:34:08] <dan2k3k4> so I should check if moz -> do this prefix ?
[01:34:42] <Cork> dan2k3k4: kinda, but you should sniff for the prefix instead of through the ua
[01:35:11] <dan2k3k4> Cork: hmm, how would I do that?
[01:35:31] <Cork> ?g modernizer
[01:35:31] <b-ot> Cork: Modernizr: the feature detection library for HTML5/CSS3 → http://modernizr.com/
[01:35:33] <bot-t> Cork, Modernizr: the feature detection library for HTML5/CSS3 - http://modernizr.com/
[01:35:46] <Cork> dan2k3k4: use it, or read how they handle it
[01:35:48] <dan2k3k4> I suppose I could change my lines to just .css(background, "prefix" + background)
[01:36:10] <dan2k3k4> then have the prefix part filled in my modernizer? will check how they do things
[01:36:13] <dan2k3k4> cheers Cork :)
[01:36:57] <Cork> (and why can't ppl wait around when they ask a question...)
[01:37:22] <dan2k3k4> ?
[01:37:31] <Cork> firos
[01:37:46] <Cork> asked a question and when i was about to answer... * firos has quit ( :s
[01:38:02] <Cork> hate when that happens
[01:38:11] <dan2k3k4> I turned off join/leaves just this morning as I found most of the channels are just full of those :/
[01:38:22] <dan2k3k4> using LimeChat
[01:38:28] <Cork> why make me do the work of looking at the code if you aren't going to wait for the answer?
[01:38:38] <Cork> dan2k3k4: i have it enabled just for this reason
[01:38:49] <Cork> so i don't sit and talk with someone that's not around anymore
[01:38:57] <dan2k3k4> heh
[01:39:18] <dan2k3k4> I usually try to tab their name like Cork to make sure they're still here :) but yeah, it is better to know if they're still here
[01:39:18] * Cork throws away the answer
[01:39:43] <edoop> wath's your common lib  you have to use ?
[01:39:56] <Cork> jquery.js?
[01:40:29] <edoop> and complementaries libs?
[01:40:36] <edoop> Using jquery?
[01:40:50] <Cork> edoop: what are you looking for?
[01:41:02] <Cork> asking generic questions will give you generic answers
[01:41:10] <edoop> es: node.js
[01:41:20] <Cork> ask specific questions if you want specific answers
[01:41:27] <edoop> or three,js
[01:41:49] <Cork> i use the lib i trust (after reading through it) and feel i need
[01:42:12] <Cork> the rest i write my self
[01:42:16] <dan2k3k4> no idea why I read x =- y; as 'x = x - y;'
[01:42:30] <edoop> i've good experience with flash developer and actionscript 2.0. i gettting migration to actionscript 3
[01:42:38] <edoop> i understand the logical oop
[01:42:38] <Cork> dan2k3k4: cause x -= y; is?
[01:42:50] <dan2k3k4> Cork: aye, I had it =- :/
[01:43:07] <Cork> dan2k3k4: and i would say thats a terrible way to write that
[01:43:13] <Cork> x = -y; is much safer
[01:43:14] <edoop> i would to share personal experiments in the time
[01:43:26] <edoop> coding in actionscript in the past
[01:43:40] <Cork> edoop: you're way off topic and really just spaming the channel
[01:43:46] <Cork> edoop: do you have a real question?
[01:44:00] <edoop> ah ok . Cork  .
[01:44:05] <Cork> (real as in jquery related)
[01:44:16] <edoop> Yes. my qyestion is general
[01:44:26] <edoop> sorry.
[01:44:37] <edoop> I ask about github repository
[01:45:08] <Cork> edoop: girhub is free to use as long as you're ok with the code being public
[01:46:18] <edoop> Cork if i want share my jquery experiments i could use github with best code optimization  ?
[01:46:35] <Cork> uh, what?
[01:46:53] <Cork> edoop: github is a webbasec git repo, nothing else
[01:47:00] <Cork> *webbased
[01:47:22] <edoop> Yes i know. but everybody can share work and experiments?
[01:47:33] <edoop> with property and license to use?
[01:47:50] <Cork> its a repo, it doens't dictate the license
[01:48:15] <edoop> Cork , i ask this  , because i see that some work requiring git  repository
[01:48:27] <edoop> EG:  show us your github repository
[01:48:32] <Cork> and again if you want to know more about github you should asking in #github
[01:48:39] <Cork> not #jquery
[01:48:44] <edoop> okk
[01:48:45] <edoop> i try
[01:48:47] <edoop> thank
[01:49:53] <edoop> Cork , i try to post a question about jquery .
[01:49:54] <edoop> now.
[01:51:02] <edoop> what's jquery editor do you use for code?
[01:51:16] <Cork> you mean ide?
[01:51:30] <Cork> vim, sublime text is two nice editors
[01:51:54] <edoop> and do you also use online free editor?
[01:52:15] <Cork> for code editing?
[01:52:16] <Cork> no
[01:52:32] <Cork> well except for possible demos and testcases
[01:52:34] <Cork> ?p
[01:52:35] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:52:59] <Cork> http://webdevout.com/test is nice too
[01:54:34] <edoop> Cork do you think that we can made 2d project   with jquery and html compatible with all current browser?
[02:25:34] <TheresaJayne> morning people
[02:25:56] <Dexy> good morning TheresaJayne
[02:27:04] <TheresaJayne> i am having problems with the click options on a confirmation box using fancybox http://jsfiddle.net/ZvhUB/  the confirm/cancel clicks are not happening any ideas?
[02:27:35] <TheresaJayne> incorrect link http://jsfiddle.net/ZvhUB/1/
[02:27:49] <Cork> heh was starting to wonder :D
[02:28:29] <TheresaJayne> the afterload is running the clicks just aren't
[02:28:30] <Cork> TheresaJayne: though that one doesn't work either
[02:28:43] <TheresaJayne> its not a runnable code
[02:28:54] <TheresaJayne> i cant really put the whole page up
[02:31:04] <TheresaJayne> the fancybox is just not closing
[02:31:49] <seutje> oh man, it's not even compatible with the oldest version jsfiddle supports out of the box q.q
[02:32:27] <TheresaJayne> i am using jquery 1.7 with fancybox2
[02:32:29] <RockyBalboa> hello all
[02:32:54] <RockyBalboa> I noticed that JQuery Mobile adds a min-height using JS to an outter div. Does anyone know a function that I can call to set this on other containers?
[02:35:06] <TheresaJayne> the problem is everywhere on the internet the same sample code is used, so there is no up to date version that workd
[02:36:50] <seutje> TheresaJayne: it doesn't seem to be firing those handlers as it doesn't have any reference to those properties you used
[02:37:21] <seutje> TheresaJayne: where did u get the example?
[02:40:23] <TheresaJayne> well i just rewrote it now it works
[02:41:07] <TheresaJayne> I added in the confirmation an onClick='confirmTrue()' and onClick='confirmFalse()'  which call the function i need.
[02:41:29] <TheresaJayne> simpler and it worked
[02:42:16] <TheresaJayne> so my confirm dialog box is now http://jsfiddle.net/sU4au/
[03:01:46] <MickRip>  does anyone have a favourite front-end form validator? Nothing seems to be more popular than the bassistance one, but it's not unobtrusive.
[03:06:00] <Woet> does anyone know a jquery plugin that generates a map like google maps without actually using it?
[03:06:08] <Woet> so an interface to move around in, zoom in, plot points, etc
[03:07:08] <JBreit2> morning
[03:07:27] <shaundunne> Without actually using GoogleMaps? You just want the functionality of the maps API?
[03:07:51] <JBreit2> I am new with jquery and I am trying to figure out how to modify some stuff in the tabs mouse over ui so I can have columns within the content area of tabs
[03:08:24] <JBreit2> I added a normall css I made for a different site
[03:08:44] <JBreit2> but it pulled all of the copy out of the content area of the jquery tab theme
[03:09:06] <Woet> shaundunne: basically, i want an interface for a map of a game.
[03:09:23] <fabioportieri> JBreit2: look at the .hover() function
[03:09:30] <NathanAbrhiem> Can someone please tell me why using this class will not over ride my listview? http://pastebin.com/phYA9X7r
[03:09:38] <relipse> how do i array_merge() in javascript?
[03:09:47] <null__> there's mapbox
[03:09:52] <relipse> link?
[03:09:55] <crawleyprint> relipse: concat()
[03:10:02] <relipse> eh?
[03:10:03] <null__> http://mapbox.com/
[03:10:12] <Woet> thanks null__
[03:10:27] <crawleyprint> relipse: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat
[03:10:55] <mindic> Hi guys, I'm developing some site with jquery however I wonder if I should throw all my function when document ready or do I need to encapsulate that. CAn you point me to a good tutorial about jquery function management. Here's the sample code. Thanks
[03:10:58] <relipse> thanks crawleyprint
[03:11:05] <crawleyprint> relipse: your welcome
[03:11:13] <Woet> null__
[03:11:19] <Woet> i want to have my own map though, not the world
[03:11:22] <Woet> not sure whether that is possible
[03:11:34] <relipse> no i want it for objects, not arrays
[03:11:35] <mindic> forgot to include link http://jsfiddle.net/WNPB4/1/
[03:11:50] <relipse> array_merge() for map
[03:12:43] <crawleyprint> relipse: try http://jqapi.com/#p=jQuery.extend
[03:13:08] <relipse> yeah thats it
[03:13:13] <relipse> i did it before with .extend
[03:13:14] <NathanAbrhiem> Can someone please take a peek at my code http://pastebin.com/phYA9X7r and tell me why my list view margins wont get over ridden by my custom class please just real fast its been killing me for 3 hours. Probably something so stupid.
[03:14:11] <TheresaJayne> I hate fancybox
[03:14:15] <trinadh> Woet: have tried leaflet or openlayers
[03:14:24] <TheresaJayne> i cant get it to display my content
[03:14:26] <trinadh> Woet: have you*
[03:14:38] <Leonvv> NothanAbrhiem, make a jsfiddle or codepen so it's easier to view
[03:14:46] <NathanAbrhiem> okay one sec
[03:18:22] <NathanAbrhiem> Leonv: im trying to do jsfiddle and its screwing everything up can u just try to look at pastebin its very short
[03:18:36] <NathanAbrhiem> one css class of list view just trying to give a margin-top to and its not working
[03:19:12] <Leonvv> allright
[03:19:56] <TheresaJayne> sob!!! Its not working!!!! http://jsfiddle.net/fuhRp/2/
[03:20:14] <trinadh> NathanAbrhiem: May be some classes are added dynamically and they are over writing your style..
[03:20:42] <trinadh> NathanAbrhiem:  i mean overriding
[03:20:54] <Leonvv> NathanAbrhiem, try to inspect the element with a web inspector, chrome has one by default, then you can see which styles are being applied.
[03:21:14] <Leonvv> Nothing seems wrong with it on pastebin
[03:21:21] <relipse> how do I use .extend as array_merge in php?
[03:22:49] <relipse> i think this: $.extend(bug, clearbug, bug); ?
[03:23:31] <Cork> relipse: you mean on a javascript object?
[03:23:35] <Cork> or a javascript array?
[03:24:32] <Cork> hmm forget it doens't matter
[03:24:43] <Cork> relipse: so you want to extend bug with clearbug?
[03:24:58] <relipse> i want to do bug = array_merge($clearbug, $bug);
[03:25:08] <relipse> yes object
[03:25:20] <Cork> and what should take precedent, clearbug or bug?
[03:25:29] <relipse> bug
[03:25:47] <relipse> just like i said wtih array_merge
[03:25:55] <Cork> then ya bug = $.extend({}, clearbug, bug) then
[03:26:02] <relipse> oh perfect!
[03:26:02] <relipse> thanks
[03:26:13] <Cork> also is it deep objects?
[03:26:15] <relipse> i knew it was something tricky
[03:26:19] <relipse> no just strings
[03:26:23] <Cork> ok
[03:26:23] <relipse> key value pairs
[03:26:42] <Cork> else it would be bug = $.extend(true, {}, clearbug, bug) then
[03:26:51] <Cork> -then
[03:27:13] <NathanAbrhiem> Okay guys I just opened it up in Chrome and my defined clas has a cross through it and so does the default one? Im not sure what is going on still
[03:27:46] <NathanAbrhiem> @trinadh: How come im being overriden if my css is after? Whats over riding it?
[03:27:58] <Cork> NathanAbrhiem: you mean the margin one?
[03:28:06] <NathanAbrhiem> yes
[03:28:17] <Cork> you have a selector somewhere else that is more specific
[03:28:39] <Cork> a more specific selector always wins over a less specific pme
[03:28:41] <Cork> *one
[03:28:49] <Cork> second comes the order they are in the code
[03:29:03] <NathanAbrhiem> I didn't put it anywhere else Cork
[03:29:19] <Cork> NathanAbrhiem: what other selector affects that element?
[03:29:37] <Cork> (you ahousl have one with margin in the css section)
[03:29:43] <Cork> *should
[03:29:48] <Cork> man i can't type right now...
[03:30:18] <NathanAbrhiem> I do
[03:30:23] <NathanAbrhiem> I created my own class
[03:30:31] <NathanAbrhiem> and defined it in the list view ul
[03:30:36] <Cork> NathanAbrhiem: what is the selector that sets the active margin right now?
[03:30:47] <Cork> .list .view ul?
[03:31:08] <NathanAbrhiem> ul
[03:31:10] <NathanAbrhiem> ?
[03:31:16] <NathanAbrhiem> I believe
[03:31:19] <Cork> no, that's not likely
[03:31:35] <Cork> id > class > element
[03:31:45] <Cork> and a longer selector wins over a shorter one
[03:32:01] <Cork> .class .class element.class > element.class
[03:32:24] <NathanAbrhiem> ok
[03:32:27] <NathanAbrhiem> hmmmm
[03:32:51] <Cork> so grab the selectors that the console shows you for that element, and dump it in a pb
[03:33:00] <Cork> that is the info needed to help you
[03:33:36] <NathanAbrhiem> i am so lost
[03:34:17] <NathanAbrhiem> http://pastebin.com/BCznrbCJ
[03:34:33] <Cork> no not the html
[03:34:40] <Cork> the selectors that match the element
[03:35:23] <NathanAbrhiem> like what
[03:35:55] <Cork> like ex http://pastebin.com/CXj2WTXU
[03:36:50] <NathanAbrhiem> http://pastebin.com/apPKEmz5
[03:37:23] <Cork> ya, just to be clear, this section http://imagebin.org/254476
[03:37:27] <NathanAbrhiem> but some are crossed out in chrome thing
[03:37:39] <trinadh> NathanAbrhiem:  http://jsfiddle.net/dDj9W/ , thats what i suspect is happening
[03:38:06] <NathanAbrhiem> ?
[03:38:19] <NathanAbrhiem> I need Margin-top on list view just to be set
[03:38:28] <Cork> NathanAbrhiem: is .ui-content .ui-listview-inset  the one that isn't crosssed out?
[03:39:07] <Cork> if so change .margin to .ui-content .ui-listview-inset.margin in your css
[03:39:15] <Cork> and it should work
[03:39:32] <NathanAbrhiem> let me see
[03:45:30] <Woet> anyone know of a good plugin like http://vectorflower.com/preview/smooth_zoom/ ? - that one is commercial
[03:45:40] <NathanAbrhiem> Cork: that worked
[03:45:42] <NathanAbrhiem> thanks man
[03:45:53] <NathanAbrhiem> but how come mine wasnt?
[03:46:36] <krz> $.get('home.html', function(data) { console.log($(data).find('meta')) }); doesn't return the meta elements? what trickery is this?!
[03:48:32] <cronus> hello. I'm trying to read a metar from http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/observations/metar/stations using jQuery.get. It is not allowed due to cross domain restrictions. Is there a way to get the file since i don't have any access to that server?
[03:51:13] <fabioportieri> Woet: good inspiration i wanna implement a plugin like that
[03:52:08] <Clex> krz: calling $() on a full HTML page (including <head>) seems to act weird, indeed.
[03:52:41] <krz> well its just for meta elements. other elements are fine
[03:53:20] <Clex> $('<html><head></head><body><p>test</p></body></html>').find('p') returns nothing.
[03:54:37] <crawleyprint> Clex: $('<html><head></head><body><p>test</p></body></html>').filter('p')
[03:54:45] <krz> $.get(home.html', function(data) { console.log($(data).find('p')) }); returns logs of p's
[03:55:51] <Clex> krz: can you get something else from <head>?
[03:56:28] <Cork> Clex, crawleyprint: snippets can't include html, head or body
[03:56:45] <Cork> if you do you need to use selectors to grab something in body
[03:56:56] <crawleyprint> sorry, I'm new here
[03:58:05] <krz> works with filter
[03:58:16] <krz> strange why it doesn't work with find though
[03:58:35] <Cork> krz: cause it cause html, head and body will be dropped
[03:58:41] <Cork> leaving you with a list of p's
[03:59:06] <Cork> '<html><head></head><body><p>test1</p><p>test2</p></body></html>' becomes <p>test1</p><p>test2</p>
[03:59:55] <Cork> its tricky handling getting full html in ajax responses
[04:00:17] <Cork> as js isn't really adapt to handle it
[04:00:17] <krz> ok that makes sense
[04:00:26] <Cork> (or the dom actually)
[04:07:20] <hakikihacioglu> hi
[04:08:26] <reuf> hello
[04:08:44] <reuf> does anyone here uses gmail and specifically labels inside of gmail?
[04:09:04] <JBreit2> man I still can't get this text to work in a two column JQuery tabs UI :(
[04:09:24] <JBreit2> can't seem to get the accordian to work either so I ended up deleting what I had
[04:13:54] <reuf> how do i make that drop down menu that you have once you hover over label in gmail?
[04:19:37] <kostodo> Is there a simple way to take a very long horizontal div and scroll its contents sideways?
[04:20:07] <kostodo> Like the actual width of the div is 5000px but I only want 800px wide to be displayed and the rest to scroll horizontally
[04:20:11] <kostodo> And loop at the end
[04:21:03] <seutje> u mean sorta like the 9001 slideshow solutions out there? :D
[04:21:33] <kostodo> Without using something overly bloated
[04:31:18] <seba4> I open a form with dialog and  it works fine. Then i got some script that toggles some live preview.
[04:31:54] <seba4> in preview text gets rendered based on keyup ... ...
[04:32:05] <seba4> it works fine until i just close dialog
[04:32:18] <Cork> kostodo: simplest is to put it in a wrapping div with position: relative; and overflow: hidden; and then change the left of the inner div
[04:32:43] <seba4> and then open new one.  Then the script is still at last .dialog form not in new one ..
[04:33:17] <Cork> seba4: how are you binding you're event listeners?
[04:34:31] <seba4> i got it like this..
[04:34:36] <seba4> $("#message_template_message, #username, #trans_message").keyup(function(){ refreshPreview();
[04:35:04] <seba4> script loads with a form template ..
[04:35:09] <Cork> ok?
[04:35:18] <Cork> and is the id's still pressent in the page?
[04:35:39] <seba4> old form is not present in html ...
[04:35:43] <relipse> how do i get 3 from model_3 string?
[04:35:56] <seba4> check sample http://securekey.seba4.info/message_templates
[04:36:08] <seutje> kostodo: well, u'll probably need a wrapper and at least 2 child elements
[04:36:28] <Cork> `js> "model_3".match(/\d/)[0]
[04:36:30] <seutje> so u can set the outer wrapper on like widht 800 px overflow-x: scroll
[04:36:35] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[04:36:39] <Cork> ?eval "model_3".match(/\d/)[0]
[04:36:41] <bot-t> Cork: "3"
[04:36:46] <seutje> and copy over the child element to the end
[04:36:54] <seba4> when u edit one value .. and dont submit
[04:37:01] <seba4> and then go to another edit..
[04:37:11] <seba4> this happends .. in live preview... at the bottom
[04:37:14] <seutje> Cork: gotta use print when using the js> ideone thing
[04:37:17] <b-ot> seutje: No output.
[04:37:38] <seutje> js> print('shaddap silly bot')
[04:37:40] <b-ot> seutje: shaddap silly bot
[04:37:53] <Cork> seutje: ya, i know; i just got feid up with it, and as bot-t is around i just picked it
[04:38:45] <Cork> man it's interesting trying to develop a complex webapp with csp set to max :)
[04:39:14] <Cork> you end up with all these problems that is normally easy to fix that suddenly is complicated ^^
[04:39:30] <seba4> i just cant figure it out what is the problem.. and how to solve it ..
[04:39:52] <trent001> Hey all first time in the jQuery chat :)
[04:39:54] <Cork> seba4: can you try generating a fiddle that shows the probelm?
[04:40:37] <seba4> uf quite some code will try:) i hope i will have same problem :)
[04:44:23] <seba4> ok meybe found what is wrong
[04:44:27] <seba4> even with closing dialog
[04:44:30] <seba4> dialog is still there..
[04:44:34] <seba4> how to destroy it?
[04:45:54] <Cork> seba4: .remove()
[04:46:44] <seba4> thx works now:)
[04:48:50] <seba4> if i got some function inside functions.js  and then one file edit.js that gets loaded when u are editing ... how to load that function from funtion.js to edit.js? importing inside?
[04:51:12] <Cork> seba4: there is no files in js
[04:51:16] <Cork> its scopes
[04:51:53] <Cork> if a resource is loaded, and the namespace it created a function is in the same namespace as you're code runs in; you can access it
[04:54:27] <seba4> one question ... i load some form trough dialog.
[04:54:47] <seba4> If i put my code inside root.js  like application.js code doesnt work..
[04:55:18] <seba4> but if i put it in a form html template with link to .js file then it works?
[04:55:35] <seba4> some idea why it doesnt work from application.js..
[04:56:50] <Lucaszz> Hi
[04:57:30] <Lucaszz> How can I avoid hunging web-browser during executing advanced javascripts for example drawning the route on the map
[04:57:42] <Lucaszz> ?
[05:01:15] <Cork> Lucaszz: you will have to prevent your code from locking the main thread for extended period of time
[05:01:23] <Cork> Lucaszz: there is a few ways to do that
[05:01:41] <Lucaszz> Cork: setTimeout?
[05:01:48] <Cork> triggering your code in small chunks and useing something like setTimeout to execute each section
[05:01:51] <Cork> yes
[05:01:55] <Cork> or use webworkers
[05:01:57] <JBreit2> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22844278/Websites/trial/index.html
[05:02:08] <Cork> (only possible in newer browsers)
[05:02:31] <JBreit2> anyone have any idea why my testimonials section on the home page tab isn't floating to the right of the main content in the white area?
[05:02:39] <Cork> webworkers only actually help if the code don't need access to the dom
[05:02:57] <JBreit2> I tried to float the #sidebar to the right but it takes it out of the white area
[05:03:04] <JBreit2> and half the time it is out of the white area anyways
[05:03:41] <Cork> JBreit2: you mean in the tab content?
[05:03:47] <JBreit2> yes
[05:03:50] <rohitag> hey can any one tell me if u store multiple jquery selecter referrence in a array, will it be fisible for memory
[05:04:02] <JBreit2> trying to have 2 columns on the 1st tab
[05:04:08] <JBreit2> which is the home tab for the home page
[05:04:40] <JBreit2> the testimonials in the browser is floating to the right but it is out of the tab
[05:04:59] <JBreit2> and in my Dreamweaver its in the tab but at the bottom below the other content
[05:05:01] <Cork> JBreit2: the h2 in the main section is pushing the main apart
[05:05:07] <Cork> and leaving no space for the float to take
[05:05:18] <rohitag> hey can any one tell me if I store multiple jquery selecter referrence in a array, will it be fisible for memory
[05:05:25] <Cork> an option would be to move it inside the #main element
[05:05:39] <seutje> ?add
[05:05:40] <bot-t> .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[05:07:26] <rohitag> hey can any one tell me if I store multiple jquery selecter referrence in a array, will it be fisible for memory
[05:08:38] * Cork points at seutje's response
[05:08:48] <Cork> rohitag: that was for you
[05:09:00] <seutje> yeah sry, forgot to address
[05:09:03] <seutje> I SURRIE!
[05:10:24] <rohitag> i didn't get that
[05:13:11] <JBreit2> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22844278/Websites/trial/index.html
[05:13:35] <JBreit2> okay got it in the tab but when I put float: right; in the css for the sidebar it pulls it back out
[05:16:09] <micthev> Hello everybody
[05:16:46] <micthev> does somedy know how to make a div sortable witch the div is inside another div sortable ?
[05:16:55] <micthev> somebody*
[05:18:07] <seba4> is with .tabs possible by default all tabs to be selected ?
[05:18:35] <JBreit2> ?
[05:19:53] <seba4> i dont want just 1 tab to be selected when u first open it. I want all to be active, but then u can still just chose 1 and other tabs will hide ..
[05:20:06] <seba4> *other tabs data will hide
[05:20:22] <micthev> something like that : http://pastebin.com/e4kKeAby$
[05:20:27] <micthev> http://pastebin.com/e4kKeAby
[05:21:30] <micthev> seba4,  $(".tabs").something
[05:22:20] <seba4> i got jquery function for tabs ... that changes show/hide for data based on links/tabs
[05:22:27] <seba4> and at first i need all active ..
[05:22:43] <seba4> just found something interesting ... need something like that
[05:22:44] <seba4> show all
[05:22:45] <seba4> http://jsfiddle.net/niklasvh/km7Le/
[05:25:26] <micthev> nobody know ?
[05:27:26] <JBreit2> this works when i view it locally in FF & Chrome but when I try & look at it via this web link it don't work in Chrome and IE
[05:27:29] <JBreit2> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22844278/Websites/trial/index.html
[05:28:02] <JBreit2> I was playing with it trying to get the testimonials section to the right which didn't work out and now it looks all funky in the browser :(
[05:28:32] <seutje> JBreit2: check ur console
[05:29:22] <seutje> JBreit2: basically, ur trying to load http resources from an https page
[05:29:44] <seutje> so instead of linking to http://foobar, link to //foobar
[05:29:53] <seutje> `g protocol agnostic links
[05:29:54] <b-ot> seutje: html - Types of URLs - Stack Overflow → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/743247/types-of-urls
[05:30:27] <JBreit2> those are the URL i got from dropbox when i copied the public link
[05:30:38] <JBreit2> came up without errors when i took the s out
[05:31:26] <JBreit2> http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22844278/Websites/trial/index.html
[05:31:49] <seutje> yeah, thank, I'm fully capable of remove the s myself though :P
[05:31:52] <seutje> thanks*
[05:32:04] <JBreit2> so how do I go about getting the testimonials section to the right in the JQuery tab.  everything I have tried doesn't work when I try to float the sidebar
[05:32:13] <JBreit2> but all that works when I am not using JQuery
[05:32:21] <seutje> I just wouldn't dare suggest you adjust server settings to provide a workaround
[05:33:49] <seutje> JBreit2: just like you would otherwise?
[05:34:06] <JBreit2> it pulls the testimonials section out of the tab every time I try to float it right
[05:34:13] <JBreit2> :/
[05:34:16] <seutje> either float the sidebars, use inline-block, flexbox, regions, ... ur pick
[05:34:21] <seutje> so clear the wrapper
[05:34:29] <seutje> `g micro clearfix
[05:34:30] <b-ot> seutje: A new micro clearfix hack – Nicolas Gallagher → http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/
[05:35:45] <JBreit2> and when I float the big content area to the left and the side bar to the right it pulls them both out the tab but has them beside each other
[05:36:04] <seutje> sry, what?
[05:36:31] <seutje> JBreit2: like this? http://i.imgur.com/czfg49P.png
[05:37:08] <JBreit2> thats how I want to have it but when I get them beside each other the wite BG is just a strip and the text is over the purple :(
[05:37:51] <seutje> like I said, clear the wrapper
[05:39:04] <seutje> #sidebar-1, #sidebar-2 { float: left; width: 45%; box-sizing: border-box; } #sidebar-1 { margin-right: 10%; } #main { *zoom: 1; } #main:after { content: ""; display: table; clear: both; } should do it
[05:39:22] <seutje> the box-sizing is just cause u have a padding on the #sidebar-2
[05:40:22] <seutje> yeah, guess u can just float sidebar-2 to the right and let the margin depend on the faulty calculation
[05:41:00] <seutje> in that case: #sidebar-1, #sidebar-2 { float: left; width: 45%; } #sidebar-2 { float: right; } #main { *zoom: 1; } #main:after { content: ""; display: table; clear: both; }
[05:43:13] <ThemNuts> Sup guys, i got this http://jsfiddle.net/9K3Ee/ where i use inArray to check if it exists or not. Thing is it always says it exists, eventhough it doesn't. any suggestions?
[05:43:35] <JBreit2> thank you so much
[05:44:00] <JBreit2> that has been stumping me for a few hours since every time I tried floating the testimonials to the right it would keep pulling it out of the tab :)
[05:44:34] <seutje> ThemNuts: arguments seem to be in the wrong order: http://jsfiddle.net/9K3Ee/2/
[05:44:38] <JBreit2> now redo the accordian and figure out why it wasn't working in the FAQ tab but worked on another site I made
[05:44:47] <seutje> it expects value, array
[05:44:50] <seutje> not array, value
[05:45:33] <JBreit2> was that for ThemNuts ?
[05:45:37] <seutje> guess tomorrow is gonna be a slow day :P
[05:45:39] <seutje> yeah
[05:45:41] <JBreit2> or about the accordian
[05:45:43] <JBreit2> ah okay
[05:45:55] <seutje> JBreit2: I didn't see a question in there, so... :P
[05:46:00] <JBreit2> gotcha
[05:46:10] <ThemNuts> right my god..
[05:46:11] <ThemNuts> thanks man
[05:46:14] <seutje> I only speak when spoken to
[05:46:22] <seutje> nah, that's a lie, sry
[05:46:41] <JBreit2> seutje, I appreciate your help on that home tab :)
[05:47:06] <seutje> ThemNuts: no worries, I would have guessed the arguments to be in that order as well, had to check zhe docs cause I never use this lil static method
[05:47:23] <ThemNuts> :( doesn't work with my JSON string
[05:47:31] <ThemNuts> probably have to make it an array?
[05:47:48] <seutje> JBreit2: I appreciate the chance to procrastrinate real work :P
[05:48:00] <seutje> ThemNuts: yeah, inArray tends to expect an array :P
[05:48:22] <seutje> u could use inObject, but it's prolly less quick
[05:48:39] <ThemNuts> would think its smart enough to recognize JSON actually is an array
[05:48:52] <seutje> oh ur just passing it a string?
[05:49:05] <seutje> ?parsejson
[05:49:06] <bot-t> jQuery.parseJSON(json): Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[05:49:16] <JBreit2> seutje, lol
[05:49:35] <JBreit2> I take it your ate the office then :)
[05:49:45] <seutje> yesh
[05:49:53] <ThemNuts> i got this:i got this: http://pastebin.com/GM4HyXC7
[05:50:04] <JBreit2> I am just working on some homework trying to get a rough layout of the home page
[05:50:18] <JBreit2> teacher said to write it in HTML which i have a html version
[05:50:35] <seutje> ThemNuts: u don't need that empty data string, do u?
[05:50:42] <seutje> like, line 5
[05:50:50] <ThemNuts> no clue
[05:50:56] <JBreit2> but then I went into some of the JS/JQuery stuff I have on my computer and was like I can do way btter if I can figure out how to edit the JQuery to change the look :P
[05:51:07] <ThemNuts> i do PHP, and realy having problems with understanding all the syntax for JS or JQuery
[05:51:17] <ThemNuts> so its step by step :)
[05:51:53] <seutje> well, ur essentially telling to pass empty data to the server, might as well not pass anything, right? :D
[05:52:16] <seutje> unless ur server checks for an empty data query string, which I sincerely doubt
[05:52:38] <seutje> JBreit2: well, looks like ur using jquery UI, so u could use themeroller to change the style from a UI
[05:54:00] <JBreit2> I don't know much about the themeroller
[05:54:06] <JBreit2> I am literally a newb
[05:54:46] <seutje> it's rly easy
[05:54:53] <seutje> pick a preset that's close to what u want
[05:55:07] <seutje> edit the things u want to look diffirently, click "download", done
[05:55:22] <seutje> http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[05:55:43] <JBreit2> yeah I am on the page now
[05:56:22] <ThemNuts> seems logical. Deleted it and passed the json throught hte parseJSON but still sees them as all in the array. http://pastebin.com/TXHpP3BD
[05:58:33] <seba4> this code is fine if i want to add class to div?
[05:58:34] <seba4> $("div[id='tabs-edit']").addClass('ui-tabs-hide');
[05:58:46] <seba4> or $("div#tabs-edit")
[06:01:32] <seutje> seba4: the latter please
[06:01:39] <seutje> seba4: and u can leave off the div
[06:02:07] <seutje> unless u sometimes have other elements with that ID that u don't  want to match, but I hope u can agree that that would be silly and error-prone
[06:02:18] <seutje> u can use the first to detect duplicate IDs
[06:02:33] <seutje> or at least that's what I use it for
[06:03:56] <seutje> ThemNuts: actually, I believe if you tell jQuery specifically that you're fetching JSON, it'll automagically parse it for you, but not entirely sure
[06:04:14] <crawleyprint> seba4: here's good read regarding jquery selectors: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/quick-tip-think-right-to-left-with-jquery/
[06:04:23] <seutje> try logging the data argument u get in the handler, so u can see if it's already parsed and what the structure is
[06:04:25] <ThemNuts> the script works in jsfiddle with basic array, but not with the sdon
[06:04:29] <ThemNuts> json¨*
[06:04:43] <ThemNuts> ok
[06:04:46] <seba4> thx will check it crawleyprint
[06:04:49] <seutje> ThemNuts: the thing is, your array values aren't strings, they're objects
[06:05:02] <seutje> like myArr[0] = {"ReservatieDataDatum":"19-04-2013","ReservatieDataKamer":"1"}
[06:05:06] <seba4> and thx seutje... more or less i was using #idname
[06:05:22] <seba4> but just found in some code... and didnt know if that is better than first sample
[06:06:17] <seutje> seba4: when in doubt, u can always try for yourself on jsperf.com
[06:07:21] <seba4> like jsfidle?
[06:07:22] <JAAulde> Hi gang. I'm using Ben Alman's (@cowboy) BBQ plugin v1.3pre from mid 2010 (latest version I can find). It relies on $.browser, so my upgrades to jQuery 1.9 are not going so well. Does anyone know of an alternative or if Ben plans any upgrades (we tried to contact Ben but haven't heard anything). Thanks!
[06:07:56] <seutje> JAAulde: he's pretty swamped with grunt right now afaik
[06:08:23] <JAAulde> seutje: yeah, I figured he wouldn't be able to respond between that and the conferences he's been attending
[06:08:37] <JAAulde> thus I am here wondering about alternatives :)
[06:08:42] <seutje> seba4: nah, jsfiddle is just to make functional demos and isolated test-cases, jsperf is designed to pitch 2 functionaly identical pieces of javascript against eachother performance-wise
[06:09:08] <seba4> oh
[06:09:49] <seba4> i dont get it tried many ways  got this now ...if (ui.index == 0 ) { $("#tabs-new").removeClass('ui-tabs-hide'); }  ... and it just doesnt show that part...
[06:09:54] <seba4> but on jsfidle works
[06:10:52] <seutje> JAAulde_: history.js is a nice alternative
[06:10:55] <seba4> my base code is on that ..
[06:10:56] <seba4> http://jsfiddle.net/niklasvh/km7Le/
[06:13:03] <ThemNuts> when i put alert(data) it gives me [object, Object],[object, Object], and so on. When i put it var myArr = $.parseJson(data) it gives 'null' .man this is complicated stuff just to see if a value excists in an array (but its not an array, its an object).. How do i get it from object to array?
[06:13:31] <seba4> seutje ...
[06:13:38] <seutje> oro?
[06:13:46] <seba4> if u got  tabs-1   tabs-2 tabs-3
[06:13:56] <fabioportieri> ThemNuts: what about console.log(data) ?
[06:13:59] <seutje> ThemNuts: yeah, looks like it's already parsed it to an array of objects
[06:14:05] <seba4> how can u define it with $("#tabs-").addclass ....
[06:14:16] <seba4> tried that it doesnt want to work..
[06:14:22] <seba4> how to pass something that can change..
[06:14:32] <seba4> like regex ...
[06:14:45] <seutje> seba4: sry, u wanna match a classname with a wildcard?
[06:14:52] <seba4> yea yea:)
[06:15:21] <seutje> u could use attribute selectors. but they aren't all that performant, so u might wanna consider caching the result
[06:15:25] <seutje> ?attribute selectore
[06:15:27] <bot-t> seutje, Multiple Attribute Selector [name="value"][name2="value2"] | jQuery ... - Matches elements that match all of the specified attribute filters. http://api.jquery.com/multiple-attribute-selector/
[06:15:39] <seutje> no wait, that's not right
[06:15:59] <seutje> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[06:16:02] <seutje> seba4: ^
[06:16:30] <seba4> :)
[06:16:38] <seutje> there's also starts with, ends with, contains space separated, ... http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[06:18:51] <seba4> oh nice nice ..
[06:19:11] <seutje> seba4: be careful with these though
[06:19:11] <seba4> [id^="tabs-"] then:)
[06:19:16] <seba4> ?
[06:19:57] <seutje> sure, that should work
[06:21:27] <seba4> damn works on fiddle not in my code:(
[06:21:55] <seutje> seba4: are the tabs not initializing?
[06:22:07] <seba4> it is working fine
[06:22:10] <seba4> just this one doesnt..
[06:22:15] <seba4> it doesnt addclass or removes..
[06:22:16] <seutje> cause then ur prolly running it in the <head> without doc.rdy or somehting similar
[06:22:31] <seutje> oh
[06:23:00] <seutje> if u add a console.log() statement before the if (ui.index...), does it get called?
[06:23:26] <seutje> or use a debugger; call
[06:23:44] <seba4> ui.index == is 1 checked it with alert ..
[06:25:19] <seba4> thx finaly something to debug:)
[06:25:26] <seba4> did everything with alert
[06:33:56] <ThemNuts> What i actually want to do is: see if the date occures in the array and add the roomnumbers to see wich number isn't in there (1,2 or 3) but if i can't even get the inArray to work this is going to be impossible
[06:34:29] <doughj3> I'm adding an element to my page dynamically, so I'm using jQuery's .on() to add a click event handler for it. However, the event seems to be triggered four times when I click just once. Thoughts?
[06:36:34] <jammypeach> doughj3, try using event.stopPropagation() on your element. like $().on('click', function(event){event.stopPropagation();});
[06:37:02] <jammypeach> that will stop the click event 'bubbling' up the dom tree.
[06:37:35] <Mottie> ThemNuts: you may need to build an array to use in $.inArray... do you have a demo?
[06:38:15] <doughj3> jammypeach: thanks, will try.
[06:38:32] <ThemNuts> well i got this: http://jsfiddle.net/9K3Ee/3/
[06:38:46] <ThemNuts> works with simple array but not with the json
[06:38:57] <shoky> ThemNuts: $.inArray doesn't return true/false
[06:39:27] <ThemNuts> the data i get is an array of objects, seems thats whats going wrong but no clue as how to fix itµ
[06:39:31] <shoky> also, you can't use it to check for the existence of an object in the array
[06:39:45] <shoky> when you're comparing it to a string (this.id)
[06:42:19] <doughj31> jammypeach: didn't seem to do it.
[06:42:52] <shoky> `demo @ doughj31
[06:42:52] <b-ot> doughj31: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:43:00] <doughj31> Will do.
[06:43:03] <doughj31> Thanks.
[06:43:42] <Mottie> ThemNuts: Are you looking for specific dates or are you trying to compare dates?
[06:43:52] <ToreadorVampire> When using something.children() is the returned collection in DOM order?  In this case I know that "something" only represents a single element (if that makes the question simpler).
[06:44:01] <Mottie> ThemNuts: like check if a date is within the range.
[06:44:27] <ToreadorVampire> Or otherwise is there a more appropriate way to get the nth child of an element?
[06:45:07] <shoky> ToreadorVampire: it should be in DOM order i believe, yes
[06:45:08] <Mottie> ToreadorVampire: try something.children(":nth-child(2)")
[06:45:29] <ToreadorVampire> Mottie: Oh yeah, herp derp.
[06:45:31] <ToreadorVampire> thx
[06:45:39] <Batt> Goodday to all
[06:45:55] <Mottie> allo!
[06:46:38] <seba4> seutje, ... i think the problem is that i am adding or removing class ui-tabs-hide  ... but jquery .tabs still adds display: none for hidden
[06:47:19] <Mottie> ThemNuts: try this: http://jsfiddle.net/9K3Ee/4/
[06:48:18] <ThemNuts> people reserve a day that they stay in my B&B. When the reservation is done, the date and the room is put in the db. Now i have a calender and want to show the free rooms. I got 3 rooms.
[06:49:02] <ThemNuts> yeah thats the first step Mottie. Nice one. And what did you do?
[06:49:21] <seba4> why my jquery code adds style="display:block" when jquery sample doesnt add that to div? it just adds class
[06:49:33] <Mottie> ThemNuts: I added a date array which pulled out the dates from your data
[06:49:36] <ThemNuts> you've put the objecs in a separate arraY?
[06:49:43] <seba4> ups it adds ...
[06:49:45] <Mottie> ThemNuts: just the dates
[06:49:47] <stream> Hi! What's the best way to preload all images (both html & css) in a dynamic generated content requested by ajax? example: http://jsbin.com/ipigof/1/edit
[06:50:23] <ThemNuts> and how  would i go about it when i want to see wich rooms are free?
[06:50:27] <seutje> seba4: yeah well jquery UI tabs was never designed to show multiple tabs at once afaik
[06:50:46] <ThemNuts> put them both in array and see if the rooms exist in array; if they don't -> its free
[06:51:03] <ThemNuts> * and see if rooms exist in array on that date
[06:51:50] <Mottie> ThemNuts: You can use the index returned from $.inArray to get the correct date from the data
[06:53:08] <ThemNuts> i got the correct date, you helped me loads with that one. I hover over date and now shows me if there are rooms occupied on that date. What i need is to know wich rooms are occupied (or free).
[06:53:49] <Mottie> ThemNuts: is that the "ReservatieDataKamer"?... all I see there is a number. Is that the number of available rooms?
[06:54:17] <Mottie> ThemNuts: or are you using the class name of the table cell?
[06:55:06] <ThemNuts> yeah its the roomnumber. I save the date and roomnumber in the database. And i use the ID wich is the date entered with php
[06:55:44] <ThemNuts> so i can max 3 dates with another roomnumber per date.
[06:56:30] <Doidel> Good day gentlemen.
[06:56:30] <Doidel> I am looking for a dropdown widget where I can have custom (html) content in it. Is anyone aware of one that's free?
[06:56:42] <Mottie> ThemNuts: so you don't need to deal with the room number at all in this demo?
[06:56:56] <ThemNuts> like: [18-04-2013 / 1] [ 18-03-2013 / 2 ] would mean room 1 and 2 is occupied. I'd like to show that when they hover over the 18th it says room 3 is still available
[06:57:29] <ThemNuts> that should be 04 on both
[06:58:03] <Mottie> ThemNuts: ok, let me see what I can do ;)
[07:05:42] <jammypeach> Doidel good day sir. have you perused this fine piece of craftsmanship? http://www.jqwidgets.com/jquery-widgets-demo/
[07:06:24] <franzliedke> hey folks. how can i get the select() event working with jquery mobile select items?
[07:09:39] <Phigment> I have a quick question on plugin authoring - is it better to use bind/unbind or on/off for event management?
[07:10:20] <seutje> on/off
[07:10:37] <seutje> well, it's better to not need to do off
[07:10:55] <Phigment> of course :-)
[07:11:13] <seutje> instead, keep track of "should I fire this" separately
[07:12:00] <Phigment> I use on/off in all my code, but all the examples and docs use bind
[07:14:11] <brettfrable> Phigment hows it going?
[07:14:22] <brettfrable> Seutje hey
[07:14:36] * aro does not say hi to brett
[07:14:52] <brettfrable> @aro why?
[07:14:58] <brettfrable> how to address someone
[07:15:00] <aro> you didnt say hi to me
[07:15:01] <Phigment> Not too bad. Just trying to make sure I do things the "right" way.
[07:15:15] <brettfrable> i thought it was just saying their name?
[07:19:54] <seutje> brettfrable: hey, sup?
[07:20:33] <seutje> Phigment: I think bind just maps to on internally for legacy purposes
[07:21:24] <NET||abuse> hi folks, i'm having a battle with slider and touch devices. i've seen stuff around about using touch-punch to make slider work, but it seems to work just as well, with or without this additional script.
[07:21:40] <Phigment> I was assuming as much, but couldn't find anything in a quick Google, so I thought I might ask
[07:22:02] <NET||abuse> and there's no sign of a swipe event moving the slider. is there a way to get the slider to work with touch dragging like functionality? or is that purely the realm of native interfaces?
[07:29:41] <amph1bius> is history.js still the way to go ? or has there been an improvement
[07:29:45] <jammypeach> NET||abuse you can use the touchstart and touchend events IIRC, but you'd need to build it in yourself unless anyone knows of a slider that does it already
[07:30:38] <amph1bius> there's tons of responsive sliders
[07:30:41] <amph1bius> with touch enabled
[07:30:43] <NET||abuse> jammypeach: ohh,, a jq ui compatible one would be what would suit best. otherwise i'll be re-building 2 other libraries our site uses which are based around the interface the ui slider exposes.
[07:30:59] <NET||abuse> the interface? by that i mean the events and ui.value and things like that.
[07:31:01] <amph1bius> checkout slidesjs
[07:31:26] <NET||abuse> amph1bius: that's a slidshow, i need a value slider..
[07:31:46] <sl33k_> Setting selected value in dropdown only works after putting an alert. What gives? http://bpaste.net/show/Ngw1MkELzA4NgN6vIb6O/
[07:31:47] <amph1bius> oh, that's trivial then
[07:31:53] <myosotis> I feel dumb asking this.... but jqueryelement.css('left') returns a value with 'px' appended. I don't want that
[07:32:06] <amph1bius> then replace('px','')
[07:32:26] <NET||abuse> amph1bius: humm? trivial?
[07:32:34] <amph1bius> sl33k_: probably race conditions
[07:33:42] <imacinto> myosotis: the left property can be set using all sorts of different units, including %'s and em's. By returning "px," it helps set the context for what unit of measure we're talking about
[07:34:44] <sl33k_> amph1bius: any workaround for this?
[07:35:25] <myosotis> oh, I just want to strip the chars 'px' from the string. just wondered if there was a builtin way.
[07:36:15] <leonvv> "500px".replace("", "px")
[07:36:57] <crawleyprint> leonvv: it's '500px'.replace('px', '')
[07:37:24] <leonvv> You're right, sorry
[07:38:10] <myosotis> thanks =) apparently I didn't miss anything in the docs then
[07:38:37] <brettfrable> leonvv how do you address someone in IRC
[07:38:58] <anli__> Is the latest jquery still accepting return false for e.preventDefault and e.stopPropagation()?
[07:39:09] <leonvv> You mean like, private message ?
[07:39:36] <brettfrable> no i mean like in the room
[07:39:41] <JBreit2> http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22844278/Websites/trial/index.html
[07:39:42] <brettfrable> im using a new client called limechat
[07:39:53] <brettfrable> and it's not highlighting colors of users when i address them
[07:39:57] <JBreit2> anyone know why my accordion on the FAQ page gott the stupid scroll bar?
[07:39:59] <brettfrable> so i wonder if im doing something wrong
[07:40:03] <JBreit2> i can't see the damn text
[07:40:44] <leonvv> I'm using limechat too, but I see the color of your name change when you use my name :)
[07:42:30] <brettfrable> hmm
[07:42:33] <brettfrable> im use to textual
[07:42:39] <brettfrable> must just be a different set up
[07:51:04] <Phigment> does anyone have a suggestion for a well written plugin I can use as an example of how to write/structure my own plugins?
[07:51:24] <amph1bius> Phigment: look up Addy Osmani patterns
[07:51:39] <amph1bius> http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#designpatternsjquery
[07:53:03] <fabioportieri> thanks for the link amph1bius
[07:54:10] <Phigment> amph1bius thanks a bunch. was exactly what I was looking for
[07:56:43] <albemuth> I'm trying to create an element which has a couple data- attributes, I expected element.data(obj) to work, but it gets ignored, it works with attr though, see http://jsfiddle.net/ZQURg/
[07:57:01] <albemuth> why doesn't "data-a" get added?
[08:00:07] <BillCriswell> albemuth: I'd expect data to work like that as well, but it just doesn't.
[08:00:32] <albemuth> :(
[08:01:21] <BillCriswell> albemuth: Wait a minute...
[08:01:46] <BillCriswell> I was wrong, that seems to work.
[08:02:48] <BillCriswell> albemuth: Did you try el.data('a') ?
[08:03:27] <crawleyprint> albemuth: it does work, just doesn't show it in the markup: http://jsfiddle.net/ZQURg/
[08:04:24] <BillCriswell> If you want it to show on the element you would need to use .attr() but then you can access it with el.data('foo')
[08:05:00] <albemuth> weird, I do need it because I'm setting the .html() of another element with the result of span, so the data- attributes get lost
[08:05:43] <crawleyprint> albemuth: then set it with attr, seems to work
[08:06:08] <albemuth> yeah, was just wondering why it wouldn't with .data
[08:06:31] <BillCriswell> albemuth: If you set it with .append() instead of rewriting the content I'd imagine it would be ok.
[08:06:52] <Z3R0> kind of interesting because http://api.jquery.com/data/#data1 says you can do it that way ;)
[08:08:37] <BillCriswell> albemuth: http://jsbin.com/apucos/1/edit
[08:09:23] <BillCriswell> You could just do .html($span); as well and it'll work.
[08:09:59] <reloadz> hey! I have li tags with class="nav". from one of these one li tag will class="nav selected". how can I make selection for $('.nav'), BUT EXEPT THE ONE LI TAGD THAT CONTAINS class="selected"
[08:10:00] <reloadz> ?
[08:10:28] <BillCriswell> reloadz: li:not(.selected)
[08:10:46] <BillCriswell> .nav:not(.selected) I meant.
[08:11:24] <reloadz> $('.nav:not(.selected)')?
[08:11:57] <albemuth> thanks, BillCriswell
[08:12:20] <reloadz> BillCriswell: THX! this is great
[08:12:56] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[08:16:30] <Z3R0> BillCriswell's on a roll ;)
[08:16:41] <BillCriswell> Awww snap.
[08:17:19] <Z3R0> lol

[08:21:51] <Z3R0> h right back at ya wilsondir
[08:22:11] <wilsondir> thanks
[08:34:53] <jimi_> How do people typically handle exceptions returned from APIs being called through AJAX requests?
[08:38:17] <chuwiey> Hi, does anyone know how to get $.ajaxTransport to return a successful state to the ajax promise object? (I'm getting my data and passing a 200 ok, but the $.ajax.state() i'm checking returns "rejected"
[08:38:20] <chuwiey> )
[08:48:33] <tubbo> any testers here? how do you mock your HTTP responses when making Ajax calls?
[09:03:30] <Assimilater> interesting discovery: jquery ui does not validate: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.jquery.com%2Fui%2F1.10.2%2Fthemes%2Fsmoothness%2Fjquery-ui.css&profile=css3&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en
[09:03:30] <Assimilater> what's with this opacity thing? Anyone know?
[09:05:07] <shoky> old IE crap
[09:05:24] <Assimilater> so it's a compatability thing?
[09:05:49] <shoky> what's the question?
[09:06:14] <Assimilater> well, mainly is there a reason for inavlid css existing in jquery ui? or is it a mistake?
[09:06:30] <NoiseEee> Assimilater: to deal with the different browsers' implementations of css.
[09:06:33] <amph1bius> can you detect css3 animation end? i tried animationend and nothing is firing
[09:07:10] <shoky> there is a reason.. the reason is old IE crap
[09:07:34] <Assimilater> so it's a compatibility thing. I see :)
[09:16:12] <aro> is there a way to catch ajax events attached to elements
[09:17:05] <PerlWebDev> is there an order that they jquery-ui addons should be loaded in a page to have them work? If so, what is the order?
[09:17:24] <Z3R0> before jquery-ui
[09:17:26] <Z3R0> after*
[09:17:40] <leonvv> aro, how do you mean ?
[09:18:11] <aro> well i have a class that i add to certain buttons (which invoke ajax actions) to show an animation when the request is in progress
[09:18:41] <aro> like $('class').click( ... $(this).addClass('spinning') etc);
[09:18:55] <aro> id like to remove that class when the ajax even associated with that element has completed
[09:19:01] <aro> event*
[09:19:07] <aro> s/even/event
[09:19:33] <shoky> ajax isn't associated with any element. do whatever you want in the ajax callbacks
[09:19:53] <aro> well an ajax event is handled via a separate piece of code
[09:20:02] <aro> id like to have a global sort of intercept
[09:21:05] <aro> does that make sense
[09:21:48] <Z3R0> aro http://jsfiddle.net/66Zyr/ ?
[09:22:08] <PerlWebDev> Z3R0, ok... there are some 20 modules and so far I've seen them have all kinds of issues depending on the order they are referenced in the page. I was hoping to find a list showing the needed order
[09:22:23] <Z3R0> PerlWebDev depends on which are dependent on the others
[09:22:45] <Z3R0> and if any are conflicting with any others
[09:23:00] <aro> Z3R0 let me see if i can create an example
[09:23:09] <aro> thats more than i want to do
[09:27:13] <b0ss_> within a function $("#save").click(function(){ } Can I place a $.post("save.php", { } and afterwards a $.get("refresh.php",function(data,status){ } ??
[09:27:22] <aro> Z3R0: http://jsfiddle.net/66Zyr/1/
[09:27:23] <aro> see that
[09:27:55] <PerlWebDev> Z3R0, which is why I'm looking for a list.
[09:29:04] <Z3R0> odd aro
[09:29:08] <Z3R0> why isn't the first one working ?
[09:29:39] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/66Zyr/1/ // aro that works just fine
[09:29:45] <Z3R0> you just didn't close (function($)
[09:29:51] <Z3R0> $(function()
[09:30:10] <aro> oh i sent the wrong link
[09:30:24] <aro> http://jsfiddle.net/66Zyr/5
[09:30:46] <Z3R0> and again, it works just fine
[09:30:48] <aro> so i want to attach an ajax success bindign to any element with the class 'change'
[09:30:50] <aro> no
[09:31:00] <aro> to perform a separate operation
[09:31:41] <Z3R0> why just the class change?
[09:31:46] <aro> so like $('.change').onajaxsuccessorwhatever(function() { });
[09:31:53] <aro> what do you mean why just the class change?
[09:32:02] <b0ss_> within a function $("#save").click(function(){ } Can I place a $.post("save.php", { } and afterwards a $.get("refresh.php",function(data,status){ } ??
[09:32:12] <Z3R0> someone was looking for that yesterday or so...
[09:32:19] <Z3R0> with $.ajaxSuccess()
[09:32:22] <aro> hmm
[09:32:25] <Z3R0> but it doesn't send the element that was triggered
[09:33:09] <aep> b0ss_: you're probably looking for $.post("url", { success: function() { $.get("  ...
[09:33:17] <aro> well i need the element that triggered it :)
[09:33:27] <Z3R0> yea I know lol
[09:34:00] <b0ss_> aep: I mean the function will perform two actions: save and refresh a page
[09:34:08] <NoiseEee> aro: then you should call a function like "changeStuffWithClassChange" in your .done()/.success() ajax handler
[09:34:24] <aro> that would require me changing several hundred ajax requests
[09:34:29] <aro> and i dont wanna do it
[09:34:30] <Z3R0> yea I saw that coming
[09:34:41] <Z3R0> you could do a global var ( I know it's proper not to )
[09:34:43] <aro> by several hundred, i mean around 540
[09:34:49] <Z3R0> and set the var to the element that was triggered
[09:34:54] <Z3R0> on request use var
[09:35:04] <aep> b0ss_: well if one isnt interfering with the other, or depending on it, you can certainly start them in parallel
[09:35:54] <NoiseEee> aro: maybe part of your problem is having 540 separate ajax requests coded.
[09:36:17] <aro> some might argue that, but maybe we just have a big site?
[09:36:22] <aro> like, very big
[09:36:25] <NoiseEee> but yes, maybe write to a window.xhrElementChanged = el;  and your $.ajaxSuccess() call can read that variable.
[09:36:46] <aro> write to that var on every ajax request?
[09:36:58] <NoiseEee> i suppose.
[09:36:59] <b0ss_> aep: yeah, no depedency between them
[09:37:01] <aro> what if another ajax request occurs before the other has a chance to read it
[09:37:52] <NoiseEee> aro: what about passing the element in the XHR call and returning it in the response?
[09:38:15] <aro> how do i do that
[09:38:23] <NoiseEee> just send it as data and send it back on the backend
[09:38:24] <aro> wouldnt that require fenagling of the jquery core
[09:38:27] <aro> hmm
[09:38:33] <aro> a jquery object?
[09:38:40] <aro> isnt it a DOM object
[09:38:45] <NoiseEee> surely a reference to the element would work.
[09:38:46] <aro> how would i pass that in the request
[09:38:53] <aro> how would i reference the element?
[09:38:59] <aro> in an ajax request
[09:39:14] <NoiseEee> don't pass in the jquery object, pass in the element it happened on.  turn it into a jquery object if you need when it comes back.
[09:39:28] <aro> the element it happened on, how would i do that?
[09:39:39] <NoiseEee> var elementHappendOn = ev.target
[09:40:08] <aro> is target a string?
[09:40:09] <aro> or what
[09:40:18] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/66Zyr/7/ // using a global thing :) but it's frowned upon I'm sure
[09:40:22] <NoiseEee> aro: its a string, and there's documentation or what too
[09:40:28] <aro> hmm ok
[09:40:32] <aro> wheres the documentation on that
[09:40:35] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/event.target/ @ aro
[09:40:35] <aro> that may help
[09:40:38] <NoiseEee> aro: where's my tip
[09:40:40] <aro> ty
[09:40:54] <Z3R0> O.o
[09:40:55] <NoiseEee> "wheres the documentation for that" = go find it dude, i'm not your errand boy
[09:41:08] <NoiseEee> where do you THINK the documentation would be
[09:41:18] <NoiseEee> sorry just let's try to show some init
[09:41:28] <Z3R0> er NoiseEee since you can only attach $.ajaxSuccess() to document
[09:41:32] <aro> ive burnt a lot of time on this issue, dont assume i havent tried
[09:41:34] <Z3R0> #document = the target
[09:41:54] <aro> Z3R0: that has the same problem - if another request occurs immediately after, it would overwrite it
[09:42:03] <Z3R0> yea
[09:42:11] <Z3R0> I knew mine wouldn't really work
[09:42:16] <NoiseEee> Z3R0: i'm saying pass the element in the actual XHR request, not .ajaxSuccess
[09:42:20] <Z3R0> ah
[09:42:25] <aro> okay how about this
[09:42:39] <NoiseEee> $('whatever').on('click',function(ev) { //pass ev.target to xhr call })
[09:42:40] <aro> is there a way to append globally an item to an ajax request
[09:49:02] <BillCriswell> aro: Maybe ajaxSetup and beforeSend?
[09:49:14] <BillCriswell> aro: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/
[09:49:53] <aro> ok
[09:49:57] <aro> thanks, ill have a look
[09:51:02] <Z3R0> BillCriswell always comes up with something apparently
[09:51:21] <BillCriswell> If you throw enough shit at a wall something is going to stick.
[09:51:32] <BillCriswell> Not sure I'm using that phrase properly.. but yeah.
[09:52:13] <Z3R0> sounds good enough to me ;)
[09:52:30] <b0ss_> aep: can I do something like this: http://pastebin.com/1zvtmzjL  ??
[09:54:10] <BillCriswell> aro: http://jsbin.com/ipikew/1/edit
[09:54:22] <BillCriswell> aro: Think that's what you were shooting for anyway.
[09:56:15] <Z3R0> well g2g guys, meeting time lol
[09:56:21] <BillCriswell> Have a blast.
[09:58:43] <aro> BillCriswell: so that will append data to the object?
[09:58:45] <aro> data request
[10:02:53] <b0ss_> Can I do something like this: http://pastebin.com/1zvtmzjL  ??
[10:03:09] <miketaylr> hi rm
[10:03:13] <miketaylr> rmill
[10:05:55] <tubbo> so let's say i have a jQuery object, $('#element'). it's not on the page, but i saved it to var element;
[10:06:00] <tubbo> so element = $('#element')
[10:06:17] <tubbo> is there any method i can run on element to "re-query" the DOM and grab the current information about this element?
[10:06:24] <tubbo> sorta like an element.reload()
[10:06:43] <BillCriswell> b0ss_: Besides this seeming a little weird I don't see why it couldn't work... just know that the $('#result') line won't happen immediately after the $.get happens.
[10:06:48] <leonvv> tubbo: if you have a handle to an element, it is always up to date.
[10:06:52] <NoiseEee> tubbo: just another call to $('#element')
[10:07:30] <tubbo> right, i figure i can do that
[10:07:37] <NoiseEee> but really what leonvv said
[10:07:47] <tubbo> leonvv: really? so if i do element = $('#element') and it returns [] (can't find the element)
[10:07:50] <tubbo> but then i add #element in later
[10:07:55] <tubbo> would element now equal a DOM object?
[10:07:58] <NoiseEee> no tubbo, not like that.
[10:07:59] <b0ss_> BillCriswell: sry to ask but why not ?
[10:08:02] <tubbo> that's what i thought ok
[10:08:03] <tubbo> :D
[10:08:10] <BillCriswell> b0ss_: async.
[10:08:14] <tubbo> i'll just do another $() call
[10:08:23] <b0ss_> right
[10:08:29] <Roy_SP> tubbo: you would need to use on() to keep track
[10:08:43] <BillCriswell> b0ss_: You can move the $('#result') line inside the success callback of the $.get
[10:08:57] <leonvv> tubbo, if you grab an element from a dom, and saved it in a variable, that variable is going to have a live connection. So lets the value changes and you reuse element.value it will have changed too.
[10:09:02] <Roy_SP> tubbo: assuming elements are "later" added on...and you still need current access to them
[10:09:06] <b0ss_> BillCriswell: Ok
[10:09:14] <BillCriswell> Can't help but feel like there isn't a better way to approach what you're tyring to accomplish.
[10:09:27] <BillCriswell> I don't know what it is though so figure it out your way haha.
[10:10:31] <LaMakina> tubbo: why dont you just store the selector of that element in a variable. and just use $(varName).func() when you need it?
[10:11:10] <tubbo> right
[10:12:16] <leonvv> LaMakina that's not efficient
[10:12:34] <LaMakina> yes, i agree leonvv
[10:13:20] <rebel_yell> can someone tell me why this would be wrong
[10:13:22] <rebel_yell>          if ($('#notice_alert').text() == "Authentication successful. You can now sign in with your facebook account!") {           alert('hello');         }
[10:13:25] <LaMakina> so how else ? leonvv
[10:13:46] <netanelweb> hello
[10:13:59] <rebel_yell> if ($('#notice_alert').text() == "Authentication successful. You can now sign in with your facebook account!") {           alert('hello');         }
[10:14:05] <rebel_yell> for some reason it wont do the alert
[10:14:13] <rebel_yell> even though i know for a fact that that is the text
[10:14:20] <leonvv> LaMakina, save the element, not the selector.
[10:14:32] <NoiseEee> rebel_yell: console.log $('#notice_alert').text() i bet its not what you think it is / there is whitespace somewhere
[10:14:41] <rebel_yell> i did
[10:14:43] <leonvv> rebel_yell, try alert($("#notice_alert").text())
[10:14:47] <leonvv> and see what it alerts
[10:15:02] <LaMakina> leonvv: but he was saying that the element wasn't present on the DOM at the time it's assigned to that var.
[10:15:40] <netanelweb> someone know good modal plugin ?
[10:16:25] <rebel_yell>  Authentication successful. You can now sign in with your facebook account!
[10:16:35] <BillCriswell> netanelweb: http://leanmodal.finelysliced.com.au/ is nice and simple.
[10:17:07] <NoiseEee> rebel_yell: compare that . with your !
[10:17:58] <rebel_yell> yea they both use !
[10:18:17] <netanelweb> BillCriswell : thanks
[10:18:25] <rebel_yell> is there a way to do if text contains the word successful
[10:18:34] <leonvv> LaMakina: It makes no sense, because that means you try to access an element which dosen't exist. And if it is being added later you have already a handle to it returned by .createElement().
[10:19:17] <NoiseEee> rebel_yell: are you doing this when the content is actually there / the dom element exists?
[10:19:29] <miketaylr> ?eval "successful".match(/success/)
[10:19:43] <miketaylr> ?slap bot-t
[10:20:13] <rebel_yell> yes
[10:20:50] <leonvv> rebel_yell: Do you have a link ? That makes it easier to debug the code
[10:20:58] <NoiseEee> rebel_yell: try to recreate i guess cuz http://jsfiddle.net/ucjpQ/ and all right?
[10:21:10] <rebel_yell> it was white space :(
[10:21:14] <rebel_yell> thanks for the help
[10:22:37] <LaMakina> leonvv: that is, if your own script added it and not some obscure 3rd party scripts that just jammed it in there :)  I'm sure there are other design flaws involved in that issue, i was just trying to help with this one specifically, if that makes sense.
[10:24:42] <leonvv> Yes, it was correct LaMakina, I just mean it isn't efficient because everything that has to do with the DOM usually is pretty heavy.
[10:25:04] <LaMakina> right.

[10:39:06] <aro> ok
[10:39:10] <netanelweb> the request already send , you need to setup new one
[10:39:52] <edlinde_> was wondering how I can make cool looking forms using query?
[10:39:55] <edlinde_> jquery
[10:40:11] <leonvv> What do you mean by "cool looking" ?
[10:40:21] <zizzl> Hey has anyone wrote any kind of code like if <p></p> is empty to display:none or something
[10:40:24] <zizzl> since WordPress likes to insert those and brake some in page code
[10:40:35] <edlinde_> leonvv: more interactive… with auto complete drop downs etc
[10:40:38] <edlinde_> ;)
[10:40:53] <anew> thx shokey
[10:40:57] <anew> shoky
[10:41:08] <brettfrable> oh man
[10:41:10] <brettfrable> i hate shokey
[10:41:16] <leonvv> edlinde: have you looked at jquery ui ?
[10:41:19] <edlinde_> I do mostly C coding for backends but now have to write a little front end to demo the work
[10:41:49] <chuwiey> Hi, does anyone know how to get $.ajaxTransport to return a successful state to the ajax promise object? (I'm getting my data and passing a 200 ok, but the $.ajax.state() i'm checking returns "rejected"(
[10:41:52] <edlinde_> leonvv: I had used jquery ages ago… is "jquery ui" something new?
[10:42:17] <leonvv> No, it is the user interface library that uses jquery
[10:42:30] <edlinde_> ah ok yeah never seen it
[10:42:33] <netanelweb> zizzi , try that : if($.trim($("selector").html())=='') ....
[10:42:36] <leonvv> what do you need as a form ? maybe I can help you
[10:43:22] <edlinde_> leonvv: so the idea is that I want to setup a form where users can send query keywords.. at the backend I am looking into using Dancer (perl web app)
[10:43:59] <leonvv> That's not that hard.
[10:44:09] <edlinde_> leonvv: I am doing some sort of NLP and have a database of Google Places (businesses) …
[10:44:25] <edlinde_> so the backend does the heavy lifting and decides which objects satisfy this query
[10:44:36] <leonvv> So what does the form consist of ?
[10:44:39] <edlinde_> I was then thinking of sending the results back to the client as a JSON object
[10:45:01] <edlinde_> leonvv: the form is just for keywords and maybe some optional fields (I haven't completely figured that out)
[10:45:28] <edlinde_> but since I know the typical objects that I have… I want the users to have the ability to select from a drop-down
[10:45:42] <leonvv> So how many objects go in one query ?
[10:45:51] <leonvv> Are they get or post queries ?
[10:46:14] <edlinde_> I had in mind something similar to what google maps has, where the left nag bar has the results listed in text and then on the right we have the google map
[10:46:37] <edlinde_> so there is a max of about 4-5 keywords in the query so I guess a GET should do
[10:46:38] <edlinde_> right?
[10:47:02] <edlinde_> The JSON object depending on how many objects satisfy this query could be large
[10:47:14] <anew> so would best thing to do is use a plugin to populate a drop down on ajax call back?
[10:47:19] <anew> or is there a one or two line solution here
[10:47:59] <edlinde_> so I basically need a sexy front end to handle keywords and also then parse the JSON object that finally comes and use google maps API to display on a map
[10:48:38] <edlinde_> anew: yeah, that could be an option, or I was thinking of must storing the list of common keyword categories in a JS array or something on the client
[10:48:48] <edlinde_> s/must/just
[10:49:10] <edlinde_> Is jquery the way to go?
[10:49:48] <anew> yes jquery
[10:50:26] <edlinde_> anew: so for the autocomplete, is it good to do a AJAX call to the backend? Or since its just 150 keywords or so..I should just download them locally?
[10:50:47] <anew> ajax imo
[10:51:22] <leonvv> edlinde, are you dutch ?
[10:51:37] <edlinde_> nope
[10:51:45] <edlinde_> swedish
[10:51:51] <leonvv> Allright
[10:52:32] <edlinde_> leonvv: you think I should look more into jquery ui then?
[10:52:38] <edlinde_> I cannot find something about forms there
[10:52:57] <edlinde_> and also is it possible to parse JSON objects using jquery?
[10:54:25] <leonvv> Most browsers have a default function for that.
[10:54:29] <leonvv> JSON.parse();
[10:55:01] <edlinde_> thanks
[10:55:15] <edlinde_> will look more into how to use jquery
[10:57:07] <chuwiey> Hi, does anyone know how to get $.ajaxTransport to return a successful state to the ajax promise object? (I'm getting my data and passing a 200 ok, but the $.ajax.state() i'm checking returns "rejected") ?
[10:57:13] <edlinde_> are there some example sites that I can see
[10:57:25] <edlinde_> just to see some more  usages of jquery
[10:58:24] <leonvv> jQuery is just a javascript framework, so I think having a good understanding of javascript first would be benificial
[10:58:51] <leonvv> but I think you will pick it up easily, it is very similar to C
[11:02:27] <hugo_moss> can someone recommend me an ajax pagination plugin?
[11:11:22] <chuwiey> hey, I am passing a 200 ok through the callback to $.ajaxTransport but the ajax call is failing, any ideas?
[11:13:19] <dcherman2> chuwiey: do you have a jsfiddle to look at?
[11:13:37] <chuwiey> dcherman2: +cando give me a sec…
[11:20:36] <chuwiey> dcherman2: http://jsfiddle.net/xXATT/ -> only problem is i can't simulate the backend outside my local network…
[11:21:19] <chuwiey> dcherman2: i added a fake call on the bottom, to show how i'm calling it…
[11:21:56] <chuwiey> dcher
[11:22:47] <chuwiey> dcherman2: everything works, and gets called appropriately. network tab will show a 200 ok next to the request and the data. the only thing that fails is the ajax deferred state…
[11:29:03] <sadtaco> http://jsbin.com/ogecen/1/edit Apparently I'm retarded, but I don't get why this doesn't work. I'm trying to turn a 1d array into a 2d array.
[11:34:01] <dcherman2> chuwiey: i dont see any network request being made ( chrome )
[11:35:00] <chuwiey> dcherman2: that's because the iframe isn't loading a real address… unfortunately i can't mimic the backend on jsfiddle…
[11:35:51] <JD-Robbs> Hi all, if I GET a string to a server app that is fully UTF8 from a NON UTF8 site. What happens to the encoding?
[11:36:10] <JD-Robbs> Do I need to GET the source encoding with it to be able to convert it to UTF8?
[11:36:27] <JD-Robbs> Or is it UTF8 automatically? ... bit at a loss
[11:37:45] <chuwiey> dcherman2: ok, it seems i've found the problem, it has to do with the callback that's doing the 200 ok. If i return an empty object for response (3rd arg) the ajax call gets resolved, if i leave it like it is now, it is rejected…
[11:38:46] <chuwiey> not sure what i should be returning then…
[11:40:15] <dcherman2> chuwiey: is json really json, or a string?  trying passing { text: json } for that 3rd arg, assuming it's a string.
[11:40:36] <DukeDrake> hi
[11:40:37] <chuwiey> dcherman2: it's json… perhaps script will work?
[11:40:55] <DukeDrake> how do I bind a click event to the background of a div, in order to hide it on click?
[11:42:02] <leonvv> document.getElementById("someDiv").onclick = function(){this.style.display = "none";};
[11:43:01] <DukeDrake> leonv: hmm ..... you mean, I need a seperate div I can use as a background?
[11:43:41] <dcherman2> chuwiey: script what?  a property on the object?
[11:44:32] <chuwiey> dcherman2: as a datatype… but i tried, and that doesn't work. neither does passing it as text without parsing the json beforehand…
[11:44:42] <chuwiey> ^ script as a datatype
[11:46:43] <anew> i'm using .append().text() to appened <option>text</option> which is working fine, but i need to appened <option val="">text</option> how can i append the value here also?
[11:46:43] <saimon69> hi, am doing an utility to create form via php and jquery and have a case in which a regex in a hidden field got changed when inserted in the DOM
[11:46:48] <anew> i'm trying val() but it's nto working
[11:48:32] <dcherman2> chuwiey: it would probably help you to look at the jquery src and use their transports as an example.  that said, i'm pretty sure you can easily fix that by returning { text: json } and using a custom converter like "iframe json" or something similar
[11:49:48] <saimon69> some code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/aANNs/2/
[11:50:44] <chuwiey> dcherman2: unfortunately, i did that :) the source acts as if 200 automatically resolves the deferred ajax call. here's an example of passing the wrong datatype and still getting a successful resolve: http://jsfiddle.net/ZQqcT/1/ - also, i tried the { text: json } option but that didn't help either. I appreciate your help though! thanks
[11:52:38] <DukeDrake> this doesn't work at all ...
[11:52:43] <chuwiey> dcherman2: sorry, this is the example: http://jsfiddle.net/ZQqcT/2/
[11:52:48] <DukeDrake> how do I bind a click event to the _background_ of a div, in order to hide it on click?
[11:53:04] <DukeDrake> i.e. it should _not_ vanish if I click on the foreground
[11:53:39] <dcherman2> chuwiey: wait what?  you want it to fail when you return a 200?
[11:55:13] <chuwiey> dcherman2: no, i want it to succeed. But in my first fiddle, you can see i'm returning a 200, but the ajax call that originated it, still fails. Supposedly that has to do with the dataType i'm passing in the 3rd arg for the completeCallback. However, in the fiddle i posted now, you can see that no matter what I put in the 3rd arg, it still succeeds… so i'm not sure what's going on…
[11:59:01] <dcherman2> chuwiey: you mean like this?  http://jsfiddle.net/ZQqcT/3/
[11:59:50] <DukeDrake> $('#background:not(#foreground)').click() doesn't work either >.>
[12:00:57] <chuwiey> dcherman2: so the prefilter and the specific dataType changed it?
[12:01:32] <dcherman2> chuwiey: yes - like i said earlier, i'm pretty sure you need to provide a custom converter if you're going to use a non-standard dataType.
[12:01:41] <emanb29> Hello! Anyone able to help me solve a quick problem with using the $.post() function to my https node.js server?
[12:02:05] <chuwiey> dcherman2: i understand. but was under the impression that json is a standard dateType… ?
[12:02:47] <emanb29> chuwiey: maybe use JSON.stringify() and make it a string, then just parse it on the other end?
[12:02:49] <dcherman2> chuwiey: it is.  how is the transport supposed to know you want it to be converted to JSON?  you have to tell it what to do.
[12:05:20] <chuwiey> dcherman2: look at the msgHandler() (first fiddle) - it does JSON.parse on the returned string from the iframe postMessage.. and then passing that into the callback under dataType - 'json', but i also tried 'script' (which should also be valid) and 'text'.. and I also tried passing a string to it, and using json as the dataType, for some reason that didn't work..
[12:05:33] <chuwiey> dcherman2: i'll keep messing with it… thank you for your help!
[12:07:16] <saimon69> any idea? this is an interesting problem
[12:09:15] <emanb29> does anyone know why a $.post() to HTTPS doesn't work accounting for the fact that jQuery is being loaded in HTTPS (from the google repository)
[12:09:26] <saimon69> working example of the problem: http://jsfiddle.net/aANNs/3/
[12:11:30] <dcherman2> chuwiey1: eh, here.  like i said earlier, you need to use a custom converter.  http://jsfiddle.net/ZQqcT/4/
[12:12:19] <dcherman2> or within your transport, change the dataType to `json` so ajax knows how to handle your response
[12:12:20] <saimon69> so how i avoid jquery on stripping those backslashes from my regex?
[12:13:44] <chuwiey1> dcherman2: i see… in the fiddle i sent initially, the dataType was indeed set to json though…
[12:13:58] <chuwiey1> and i was of course passing in json
[12:15:04] <dcherman2> chuwiey1: nope - here, look at the logging i added to your original example.  the dataType is `iframe`.  http://jsfiddle.net/xXATT/1/
[12:16:32] <chuwiey1> dcherman2: ah, beautiful, that explains it… thanks! so would i just add a converter for 'iframe json' ?
[12:18:25] <dcherman2> chuwiey1: backwards = "json iframe" as in my example.  and it depends on how you're returning your response.  if it's { text: '' }, use text.  if it's { json: {} }, use json
[12:18:58] <chuwiey1> dcherman2: really appreciate it! thx!
[12:21:26] <saimon69> do anybody know if using append() remove backslashes?
[12:21:37] <saimon69> appendTo() actually
[12:26:24] <culh> I was using .live() for 'click' events on future elements. Does .on() do the same on jq 1.9x ?
[12:26:31] <say2joe> yes
[12:27:21] <culh> for example: .on('mouseenter', function(e) { ... });
[12:27:40] <culh> k

[12:35:07] <maZtaiR> hi all, anyone knows of some kind of a logo slider which slides one logo at a time?
[12:35:38] <maZtaiR> something like this, but then one logo at a time (and without any style): http://tympanus.net/Development/Elastislide/
[12:35:56] <jferrie> Hey guys, anyone know of a good select box plugin with touch support?
[12:42:54] <jackson25> anybody knows how can i improve this code using the onlick event in the text field http://jsfiddle.net/RzWeL/
[13:12:06] <andre_pl> when $.load() is used to insert remote ajax content into a container, if that content has embedded script tags, is that script executed after the content has been inserted or before? it seems that any script i embed there cannot see the content of the page outside of the remote content
[13:12:52] <Assimilater> how could one have an accordion that doesn't automatically collapse other tabs when a new one is opened?
[13:13:24] <MaxSan> Heya
[13:13:32] <alainus> Hi.. i'm getting syntaxerror on #9 in this code... What could be the problem? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4f851a3cbaa99665d31b
[13:14:08] <andre_pl> alainus: you need to change it to getReading: function (event, ui) {
[13:14:17] <MaxSan> Anyone used smart wizard?
[13:14:22] <alainus> andre_pl, thanks
[13:14:25] <andre_pl> np
[13:14:53] <andre_pl> alainus: you'll need a , after the function definition too
[13:15:00] <andre_pl> right before 'create'
[13:16:03] <alainus> andre_pl, now I'm getting referenceError: getReading is not defined. Here's the second code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3e6b8c27cf1092c7a460
[13:19:21] <Assimilater> eg this will allow the user to collapse a tab: http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/TDAY7/ but it would be nice to allow for all tabs to be open, or two of them
[13:19:48] <andre_pl> alainus: alainus what you're trying to do doesn't really make sense, do you want all 3 to call the exact same code? because right now its trying to set the RESULTS of calling getReading() to the property of your new object. but you can't call that method becuase you dont have any of the data
[13:21:31] <andre_pl> alainus: if you're trying to use the same function for all 3 properties, and you're just trying to avoid duplicating it, then you probalby want this: https://gist.github.com/andrepl/1d92f415f4e4e50cd621
[13:22:37] <alainus> andre_pl, thanks, that's what I was trying to do, though only create and slide are the properties, but i can just delete the extra one
[13:23:31] <andre_pl> alainus: glad to help

[13:31:50] <sunbeam> When a input/select field is disabled, it will never post any data?
[13:31:54] <sunbeam> any idea how I can fix this?
[13:32:20] <GaryOak_> sunbeam: hidden field?
[13:32:56] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: you can alternatively use "readonly" iirc
[13:33:34] <GaryOak_> sunbeam: yeah I think you can disable the ability for the user to modify the field
[13:33:39] <emanb29> Hey can anyone help me diagnose an HTTPS $.post() issue?
[13:34:34] <sunbeam> GaryOak_: I did
[13:34:37] <sunbeam> that's not the issue
[13:34:45] <sunbeam> this field:
[13:34:47] <sunbeam> disabled="disabled"
[13:34:49] <sunbeam> input field
[13:34:55] <sunbeam> has a value="something"
[13:34:59] <sunbeam> still is empty when being posted
[13:35:06] <sunbeam> any idea how I can fix this?
[13:35:08] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: what i'm saying is change disabled="disabled" to: readonly="readonly"
[13:35:09] <houser> Hi, How can i select id="idname1", id="idname2", id="idname3", id="idname4" in a single jquery select?
[13:35:14] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: ok thanks
[13:35:15] <GaryOak_> sunbeam: I think it's like editable='false' or something
[13:35:15] <sunbeam> sec
[13:35:17] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: OR put that value in a hidden field and post that
[13:35:22] <sunbeam> ok hold on
[13:35:27] <sunbeam> and what about <select>?
[13:37:17] <GaryOak_> sunbeam: NoiseEee is correct, there is a readonly attr you can use ex: <input class="example" type="checkbox" readonly>
[13:37:20] <sunbeam> so readonly="readonly" is fine?
[13:38:03] <GaryOak_> should be
[13:38:22] <houser> anypne?
[13:38:59] <GaryOak_> houser: use a class in addition to an id?
[13:39:27] <houser> GaryOak_, i cannot. im not generating the html
[13:39:33] <Derimagia> houser $('#idname1, #idname2') and so on should work.
[13:39:55] <houser> Derimagia, yeah, but i dont know how many idname there are
[13:40:03] <GaryOak_> houser: or you can do $('#idname'+i) in a loop
[13:40:12] <GaryOak_> but you wanted a single select
[13:41:02] <houser> GaryOak_, yes i was hoping for something like $('#idname{.}')
[13:41:30] <Derimagia> houser $("[id^=idname]") then
[13:41:52] <GaryOak_> Derimagia: houser: Yeah using some sort of regex
[14:04:38] <Assimilater> is there a way to trigger the toggler that ui uses on accordion so it uses the default animation? (I'm trying to make a widget that will allow expanding all tabs)
[14:04:45] <Assimilater> here's a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/TDAY7/3/
[14:06:16] <Assimilater> another problem with what I have right now is it doesn't toggle the icon or background color of the h3
[14:11:18] <sam452> I'm learning jquery and I have what I think is a complex thing to do. I have a tr with images whose src is "xxx_active.png" I need to build a hover so that each of those img will be swapped out to "xxx_highlight.png".
[14:11:24] <sam452> So I think I have to build an array of each of those img in the first part of the hover function. If so, then I'm unsure how to match up the "yyy_active.png" with its counterpart of "yyy.highlight.png" How would you do that?
[14:12:13] <sam452> For the first part of the hover function. "fred_active.png" s/b replaced with "fred_highlight.png"
[14:12:34] <sam452> I think I can build the array, but how to match 'em up?
[14:13:00] <PerlWebDev> why build an array when you can just use regex to get the information from the part
[14:14:06] <tsdh> Hi. I'm new to jQuery and JavaScript and need a little help.
[14:14:33] <sam452> Hmmm. thx PerlWebDev:
[14:14:58] <PerlWebDev> since the part that changes is the first X characters and the rest is common
[14:15:57] <tsdh> I use autocomplete with a source of the [{label: "x", value: "x.html"},...] form.  What do I need to do in order to make selecting an item browsing the page that's the value of that entry?
[14:17:54] <Miguel> Hello, I am having a huge problems with setTimeout in a JQuery plugin. Could someone help me out?
[14:18:10] <Miguel> This is what I have: http://www.codepen.io/mdmoura/pen/KdyJH
[14:18:48] <Miguel> It is a tooltip plugin ... Everything is working. But I would like to be able to move the mouse over the tooltip without it to disappear.
[14:19:08] <GaryOak_> Assimilater: Here is something may not be what you were looking for?
[14:19:14] <PerlWebDev> tsdh, might be doable if the item to show has an attribute who's value is 'x'
[14:19:45] <Miguel> I tried to use setTimeout and clearTimeout but when I fix one thing I get a problem somewhere else.
[14:19:56] <GaryOak_> Assimilater: oh man link http://jsfiddle.net/gHS6M/
[14:20:04] <Assimilater> GaryOak_: thanks, was about to say :P
[14:20:27] <Miguel> The important code is at the end of the Mouse Enter event and in the Mouse Leave event.
[14:20:39] <Miguel> Anyone?
[14:20:52] <tsdh> PerlWebDev: Um, I don't get you.  The completion works fine, e.g., the dropdown lists x.  When I select it, the input field contains x.html.  What I want instead is to browse x.html.
[14:21:05] <Bloomberg> Hello guys!!
[14:21:16] <Assimilater> GaryOak_: what's the difference from the link I posted?
[14:21:42] <GaryOak_> Assimilater: the little toggle button?
[14:21:51] <Bloomberg> Anybody of you know how can I disable the default right click menu and allow to show a new menu own with jquery?
[14:22:24] <Assimilater> GaryOak_: I don't see a toggle button? Forget to save some changes?
[14:22:52] <GaryOak_> Hmm, haven't used jsfiddle very much
[14:23:01] <Assimilater> try pushing update
[14:23:32] <GaryOak_> Assimilater: maybe this one http://jsfiddle.net/gHS6M/1/
[14:23:41] <Assimilater> there we go :)
[14:25:20] <GaryOak_> Assimilater: cool
[14:25:48] <Assimilater> GaryOak_: ah, I see I've confused you with my question. So basically how I posted it functions like I want it with a couple exceptions: it uses the toggle() animation which is a little different than the animation ui uses for accordian (a vertical slide)
[14:26:21] <Assimilater> GaryOak_: the second difference being it doesn't change the icons or the background color. I'm just not familiar enough with the inner workings of UI to manually trigger their toggle function that does all that
[14:27:03] <Assimilater> reading over it now, but i'm really a newbie at plugins and core stuff
[14:27:45] <GaryOak_> Assimilater: I think I understand your question now, you just have to start thinking in events.
[14:28:08] <Gazpacho> is there a jquery plugin that makes coffee
[14:30:44] <Assimilater> GaryOak_: (in essence I'm just making a workaround before I suggest an 'autoCollapse' property default to true in the accordion initializer so I can show what it would look like, and use it that way on my site while it's being developed. If I can figure my way around it I'll go ahead and post the suggestion on get)
[14:31:22] <Assimilater> (git*)
[14:31:39] <Miguel> Hello, can anyone, please, help me with my problem? http://www.codepen.io/mdmoura/pen/ckDhn
[14:31:41] * pachet sees GaryOak_ and automatically thinks *nemesis*
[14:32:44] <GaryOak_> Assimilater: there is an animate property you can set in the accordion settings
[14:33:55] <Assimilater> GaryOak_: I'm  not trying to change the animation, I'm trying to determine what animation they use
[14:34:13] <GaryOak_> Assimilater: I guess I didn't understand :P
[14:34:45] <Assimilater> GaryOak_: haha, I will attempt again. So the end game result is the accordion exactly as it is EXCEPT allowing multiple tabs to be open at once
[14:34:59] <GaryOak_> Assimilater: ok gotcha
[14:35:12] <Assimilater> GaryOak_: it would be nice if there was an autoCollapse property which would flag whether already open tabs are collapsed when a new tab is opened or not
[14:35:42] <Assimilater> GaryOak_: but in the meantime I'm trying to make a simple workaround without manually adding a bunch of css classes to my html
[14:36:17] <GaryOak_> Assimilater: makes sense, it seems strange they don't let you open all of them
[14:36:44] <Assimilater> GaryOak_: indeed, and goolging shows a significant number of people asking for how to do it, but they don't seem to like the idea for some reason
[14:37:04] <Assimilater> haven't found the thread in particular where they explain why but anyways
[14:37:33] <GaryOak_> Assimilater: It might be because it would expand the div size required for accordion to fit in
[14:38:31] <Assimilater> GaryOak_: possibly, but then what of heightStyle: "content" which also removes the idea of a 'set height' for an accordion?
[14:39:15] <Assimilater> not that i'm in favor of removing that option, far from it :P
[14:39:53] <GaryOak_> unfortunately it doesn't look like there is really a clean way to do this, at least using just jquery-ui
[14:39:57] <tsdh> So to answer myself: Hooking into the select event and browsing its ui.item.value is what I asked for.
[14:40:44] <Assimilater> not a clean way to trigger their already existing method? can you determine what their default animation is?
[14:42:10] <Assimilater> looks like at one point they *were* developing a "panel"
[14:42:15] <Assimilater> where did that go?
[14:43:50] <PerlWebDev> tsdh, that sounds like what I suggested
[14:44:45] <tsdh> PerlWebDev: I just didn't get it. ;-)
[14:45:02] <GaryOak_> Assimilater: the 'panels' in the docs are each tab
[14:46:02] <Assimilater> GaryOak_: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/expand-all-zones-for-an-accordion I'm looking here, one of the replies mentions the creatino of a 'panel' widget
[14:46:23] <GaryOak_> the heightStyle property just determines how the panels height will change, not really the height of the accordion itself
[14:47:19] <GaryOak_> Assimilater: hmmm interesting
[14:47:24] <Assimilater> GaryOak_: but if the panels have differing heights then the height of the accordion is not fixed, which is what I would think the main idea is
[14:53:28] <GaryOak_> Assimilater: looks like the guy in that thread was using a function called .slideToggle()
[14:54:01] <GaryOak_> http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/ so instead of toggle, use slideToggle
[15:00:09] <Foxhoundz> I find it weird jQuery merges stuff with jQuery UI
[15:00:28] <jacoluta> It is better to include js via url. or to download the code and include it locally? (ignoring the fact that the hosted code may change)
[15:00:31] <Foxhoundz> like slideToggle or fadeIn should really be part of jQuery UI as an extension of the base jQuery project
[15:10:39] <GaryOak_> I think because they can be used on any element and not just the jQuery UI elements they made them part of jquery, that's a guess though.
[15:10:41] <norjor> I need to do some extensive overlay/modal-window functionality, anyone can recommend a solid and extendable framework ?
[15:13:00] <Assimilater> norjor: you're in the jquery channel, and jquery ui has good modal-window options. have you looked at them?
[15:13:21] <GaryOak_> jacoluta: There is no difference, you are pulling the file from a server to a client either way, the only real difference is that you can't modify the js from the url before it gets to the client
[15:19:02] <wroathe_> Say I've got a cached set of dom elements like: this.pages = $('.page') and at some point later on down the code I need jquery to update that collection and perform the query again is there a jquery method to forces a new query of the dom or do I have to repeat that same assignment operation?
[15:19:09] <wroathe_> like this.pages.update()
[15:24:36] <awc737> I have a PHP app with RESTful API, and I don't want a full blown SPA JS framework, but I want something simple which helps scope and separation of concerns
[15:24:51] <awc737> I'm not a JS expert, so something light and easy
[15:25:51] <GaryOak_> wroathe_: you probably should just redo the query, I don't think there's a way around reaccessing the dom if you are wanting to see if things have changed
[15:37:24] <sunbeam> Does anyone know how I Can have datepicker use dates in the format yyyy-mm-dd
[15:39:06] <GaryOak_> check out the dateFormat in the docs http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-dateFormat
[15:43:36] <tw2113> whoa...jQuery 2.0 is out
[15:45:02] <alex88> Oh nice!
[15:45:04] <GaryOak_> tw2113: lol
[15:45:14] <tw2113> http://blog.jquery.com/2013/04/18/jquery-2-0-released/
[15:45:47] <AaronCampbell> If I want to listen to the ready event for document AND on a specific image, how can that be put in a single selector?  Something that would combine jQuery(document).ready() and jQuery('img.someclass').ready()
[15:46:52] <alex88> Finally dropped support to crappy browsers :)
[15:47:05] <Andrew_R> AaronCampbell: You should be save to just use $('img.someclass').ready(), the document.ready event would have already fired by then.
[15:47:07] <Andrew_R> *safe
[15:47:30] <AaronCampbell> Andrew_R: I need to compute something at both points though
[15:48:08] <alex88> Aar
[15:48:12] <alex88> Sorry
[15:48:21] <Andrew_R> AaronCampbell: then just put both in separately
[15:48:40] <Andrew_R> so have two .ready() event handlers, one for document and one for img.someclass
[15:49:23] <AaronCampbell> Andrew_R: That's what I had, just seemed odd because I can usually combine two elements with a comma like jQuery('img, a.image')
[15:49:37] <AaronCampbell> But not with document (at least not that I found)
[15:50:11] <alex88> Since document is an object not a selector
[15:51:05] <Andrew_R> AaronCampbell: do you want to run the exact same code at both ready events?
[15:51:21] <AaronCampbell> Andrew_R: Yep, same function
[15:53:56] <sunbeam> Does anyone know how I Can have datepicker use dates in the format yyyy-mm-dd
[15:54:14] <sunbeam> dateFormat: 'dd-mm-yy' doesnt work
[15:54:23] <sunbeam> dateFormat: 'yyyy-mm-dd' doesnt work
[15:57:05] <sunbeam> nvm
[15:57:46] <Andrew_R> AaronCampbell: You can do it, but it's not pretty
[15:57:49] <maletor> guys all these users are calling me saying nothing works. they are all using ie 6/7/8. any ideas?
[15:57:50] <Andrew_R> a = $(document).toArray(); a.push($('body').toArray()); $a = $(a);
[15:58:19] <jeffrico> Hello All,
[15:58:19] <jeffrico> I really suck as js, and I need help badly
[15:58:19] <jeffrico> http://jsfiddle.net/V4X4t/59/
[15:58:19] <jeffrico> So I need to use this delegate method, I suppose on the toggle-main class (see fiddle)
[15:58:19] <jeffrico> This is a solution to this problem:
[15:58:19] <jeffrico> http://www.yiiframework.com/forum/index.php/topic/33618-listview-pagination-and-jquery/
[15:58:21] <jeffrico> or alternatively:
[15:58:23] <GaryOak_> maletor: jQuery 1.9
[15:58:23] <jeffrico> http://www.yiiframework.com/forum/index.php/topic/30000-clistview-style-jquery-are-not-working-after-pagination/
[15:58:26] <jeffrico> Please help
[16:00:02] <AaronCampbell> Andrew_R: I'll just keep them separate for readability
[16:00:09] <AaronCampbell> Andrew_R: Thanks for all your help
[16:00:26] <Andrew_R> good idea, that other way is a bad hack
[16:00:58] <Andrew_R> you should create one function though, and call it like $(document).ready(myReadyFunction);
[16:01:21] <Oria1024> Hello - new to learning jquery and am stuck on some logic in my code.  I have three tabs and when I click on one I want to hide the content div that was showing previously and show the new content.  Someone point me in the right direction?
[16:02:37] <Andrew_R> maletor: <!--[if lt IE 9]> <script>location.href="http://browsehappy.com"; </script> <!-- <![endif]-->
[16:02:47] <Andrew_R> that should help
[16:03:30] <AaronCampbell> Andrew_R: Yep, I did
[16:04:53] <Andrew_R> jeffrico: that's not a delegated event
[16:05:18] <Andrew_R> you are binding the function to the click event on every '.toggle .toggle' that is currently on the page
[16:06:05] <AaronCampbell> jeffrico: What Andrew_R said...if that's what you WANT to do, here is your code working: http://jsfiddle.net/TmN9t/
[16:06:06] <Andrew_R> `api on
[16:06:06] <b-ot> Andrew_R: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:06:24] <owzzz> Hi, can someone help me with an jquery ajax question
[16:06:24] <owzzz> http://jsbin.com/ifunuw/1/
[16:06:42] <owzzz> I keep getting the error : Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
[16:07:53] <jeffrico> I know, all my attempts have been futile,
[16:08:03] <jeffrico> I basically need to do: paraphrase:
[16:08:12] <jeffrico> I was having the same problem, and here's my conclusion:
[16:08:12] <jeffrico> For dynamic element generated by ajax, you can't directly bind an event to it as the binding will lost whenever the elements are updated by ajax.
[16:08:12] <jeffrico> Try using delegate:
[16:08:12] <jeffrico> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[16:08:12] <jeffrico> Select DOM parent of the dynamic element (usually the one which encloses Clistview) and then delegate the click event to its dynamic child, in your case $(".toogle").
[16:08:14] <Gazpacho> owzzz, are you pulling in jquery?
[16:08:45] <jeffrico> sorry not toogle
[16:08:55] <Oria1024> I've got my HTML and script here http://pastebin.com/FDgfMHJU if someone can point me in the right direction I would be most appreciative.
[16:08:56] <jeffrico> toogle-main
[16:08:56] <owzzz> the lib?
[16:09:27] <owzzz> Im just showing you the example code in js bin I'm not trying to execute it there
[16:09:39] <Andrew_R> delegate() has been replaced by on() as of 1.7
[16:10:14] <jeffrico> so in brief i need to:  Select DOM parent of the dynamic element (toogle-main), then delegate the click event to its dynamic child, in my case $(".toogle")
[16:10:15] <jeffrico> aha
[16:10:23] <jeffrico> that might already be a step closer
[16:10:38] <jeffrico> I am effectively using 7
[16:10:44] <Gazpacho> owzzz: maybe the missing token is on the line just before what you posted
[16:10:54] <Gazpacho> or rather, not there
[16:11:53] <jeffrico> dmm I love jsfiddle
[16:12:31] <owzzz> in the dev tools console opposite the error is a link to the file
[16:12:39] <owzzz> when I click it, it shows me the json
[16:13:03] <Andrew_R> jeffrico: http://jsfiddle.net/TmN9t/1/
[16:13:29] <owzzz> http://jsbin.com/ifunuw/3/
[16:13:41] <AaronCampbell> jeffrico: http://jsfiddle.net/TmN9t/2/
[16:13:49] <Andrew_R> you can use .on() to bind the click event to #togglecontainer, but it only runs the function if the element clicked is '.toogle .toggle'.
[16:14:04] <jeffrico> perfect
[16:14:05] <Andrew_R> I added the "Add New" link to show you that if you dynamically add more, they still work.
[16:14:22] <jeffrico> ah cool
[16:14:26] <jeffrico> but don't need that
[16:14:44] <jeffrico> superthanks
[16:14:51] <Andrew_R> no you don't need that exactly, but your code that dynamically adds new elements will basically be doing the same thing
[16:14:54] <jeffrico> will give it a try and report back in a minute
[16:16:53] <jeffrico> does it matter that toogle isn't a direct child w/respect to container, rather an additional level down?
[16:17:30] <Andrew_R> no, click events bubble up (unless they are stopped somewhere along the way)
[16:24:44] <jeffrico> gd, still not working
[16:25:27] <jeffrico> I mean I suppose the code is, the problem is I have this paginaiton widget, and the link is properly displayed
[16:26:13] <jeffrico> on first page
[16:26:43] <jeffrico> the pagination is ajax driven, but the event is lost on further pages

[16:52:17] <jeffrico> ok one more question: I'm encapsulating the code with jQuery(document).ready(function() {
[16:52:25] <jeffrico> but this is exactly the problem
[16:53:08] <jeffrico> I need these to be event that not on the page at document.ready.
[17:24:40] <alainus> from all elements that have $('[data-attribute]'), how do I select the ones that have data-attribute value different than "string" ?
[17:25:12] <alainus> $('[data-attribute!="string"]') doesn't work because it'll select items that don't have data-attribute="" as well
[17:25:12] <Assimilater> i get a little nervous about reporting bugs in the wrong place, is this: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues?labels=&page=1&state=open the right place to point out taht the link to the contributor license agreement on this page http://jqueryui.com/development/ is broken?
[17:34:00] <Gazpacho> is there a jquery plugin for dogs

[17:35:07] <Gazpacho> i want to put a picture of a dog on my web page, is there a plugin that does that
[17:35:36] <jjosh> :o
[17:36:03] <jjosh> if you get an answer for that, please let me know
[17:36:15] <jjosh> i have a cats pic too , having the same problem
[17:37:27] <coldhead> you can actually do that without jquery
[17:37:32] <coldhead> first, open dreamweaver
[17:37:39] <philfreo>  I tried to submit this in the jQuery bug tracker but it says my password is invalid and I haven’t received the forgotten password link :(  Bug shows difference in behavior between 2.0.0 and 1.9.1 in Chrome: http://jsfiddle.net/philfreo/7gUBk/
[17:37:43] <coldhead> then drag and drop the photo
[17:37:53] <jjosh> you are not serious right? :-s
[18:04:21] <cpg> hi, i am trying to clean up some code gell on my lap and i am a bit new to js/jq
[18:04:24] <cpg> this is the code https://github.com/amahi/platform/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/forms/remote-checkboxes.js
[18:04:51] <cpg> seems to be working, but i like to make it cleaner
[18:05:24] <cpg> i was wondering if there is some advice you can give to make some of the code more streamlined
[18:05:37] <cpg> like putting stuff in some other methods or something
[18:11:19] <intergalactic> thinking about attending the portland conf
[18:13:00] <intergalactic> anyone know if coupon codes are available for it.
[18:20:19] <coldhead> i'd check twitter, intergalactic
[18:21:01] <intergalactic> thanks.
[18:21:21] <intergalactic> i'm unemployed so i need any break i can get.
[19:16:40] <seaworthy> how do i add a key up even to a dynamically generated input?
[19:17:32] <coldhead> $('.some_container').on('keyup', 'input', function () {...});
[19:18:22] <seaworthy> 1 sec i might have had a mistake somewhere else
[19:18:27] <seaworthy> i ll give it a try
[19:24:24] <seaworthy> okay try yours
[19:24:38] <seaworthy> trying
[19:26:51] <seaworthy> hmm didn't work
[19:32:41] <seaworthy> http://jsfiddle.net/eVHJY/
[19:32:46] <seaworthy> any idea why this does not work
[19:42:15] <zakj> seaworthy: since the input was generated before you need to bind the callback, you don't need to use the selector argument to .on(): http://jsfiddle.net/D2ycg/
[19:43:04] <seaworthy> what do i do if the name is name="rate[0]" for the input
[19:43:57] <coldhead> use a better name :P
[19:51:21] <sam452> Hello, I'm trying to understand jquery targeting. In a hover action when the mouse goes over a tr I want a text:input that is a child to be targeted.
[19:51:28] <sam452> But this doesn't seem to work: (".slide_row" > "input:text")
[19:52:12] <sam452> I can leave off the parent class of the tr but it doesn't activate when I mouse over the row.
[19:53:08] <coldhead> sam452: a selector is a single string
[19:53:16] <coldhead> what you're doing there is using > to compare two strings
[19:53:25] <coldhead> just one set of quotes around the whole thing
[19:53:55] <coldhead> ?eval ".slide_row" > "input:text"
[19:53:59] <bot-t> coldhead: false
[19:54:07] <coldhead> that's your selector: $( false )
[19:55:48] <sam452> thx coldhead: but this ("tr > input:text") does not activate but ("input:text") does.
[19:56:44] <coldhead> > means immediate child
[19:57:01] <coldhead> and the immediate child of a <tr> should be a <td>
[19:57:09] <coldhead> so you probably don't need the >
[19:58:19] <sam452> Yes, there is some intermediate children. but I think you suggest this: ("tr input:text") unless I misunderstood.
[20:23:32] <k_sze[work]> The documentation says that "For backward compatibility with XMLHttpRequest, a jqXHR object will expose the following properties and methods:", including the "status" property. So what's the newest way to get the status?
[20:29:56] <seaworthy> why does this not work http://jsfiddle.net/JpwpM/1/?
[20:31:06] <zakj> because when you call $('input[name=rate]') on line 17, nothing matches it (addInput has not yet been called)
[20:31:36] <Andrew_R> k_sze[work]: you can use .done() for success ("200") and .fail() for anything that fails
[20:32:21] <k_sze[work]> Andrew_R: yes, but inside fail(), I can test for the status, right?
[20:33:47] <Andrew_R> fail() receives an jqXHR as the first parameter
[20:34:07] <Andrew_R> I see what you are saying on the documentation page "For backwards compatibility..."
[20:34:37] <Andrew_R> if you need to do something different depending on what fail code you receive, you'll have to use jqXHR.status
[20:36:14] <Andrew_R> k_sze[work]: oh, I found something else you might be interested in
[20:36:50] <Andrew_R> look at the "statusCode" under settings on the $.ajax documention page
[20:37:11] <sam452> coldhead: is there something else I can try? noting found on Googles
[20:37:32] <Andrew_R> so you could do statusCode: { 404: function() { // this only runs for 404's } }
[20:38:23] <k_sze[work]> Interesting!
[20:38:32] <seaworthy> zakj: http://jsfiddle.net/JpwpM/2/ this don't work either
[20:38:41] <seaworthy> your suggestion
[20:39:35] <seaworthy> implied suggestion
[20:40:39] <Andrew_R> seaworthy: you're using .on() wrong. The second parameter looks for elements inside the original selector.
[20:41:14] <Andrew_R> so you're binding a keyup event on input tags inside input[name=rate] (don't exist and not possible with valid HTML)
[20:41:25] <Andrew_R> http://jsfiddle.net/JpwpM/5/
[20:42:03] <zakj> seaworthy: you'll still need to drop the selector argument to .on(), since you're calling it on the element itself rather than its container: $('input[name=rate]').on('keyup', fn...)
[20:42:21] <seaworthy> hmm
[20:42:23] <seaworthy> thanks
[20:42:30] <Andrew_R> however, that's not really the best possible solution
[20:42:42] <seaworthy> ok whats better
[20:42:57] <Andrew_R> using your original .on() with a minor tweak, you can set up binding on the table one time, instead of binding to every input when it's added
[20:42:58] <Andrew_R> just a sec
[20:43:24] <houser> Hi, Anybody knows why animate don't work on background color?
[20:43:42] <Andrew_R> http://jsfiddle.net/JpwpM/7/
[20:43:55] <Andrew_R> houser: are you including jQuery UI?
[20:44:13] <houser> Andrew_R, no, im not using jquery UI
[20:44:13] <seaworthy> well i am going to have a variable number of these
[20:44:35] <seaworthy> depending on many times the user clicks the button that call addInput
[20:45:21] <Andrew_R> seaworthy: that's fine, /7/ sets up binding the keyup event one time on the table#shipping element, but only applies to elements that match 'input[name=rate]'
[20:45:42] <Andrew_R> the keyup event bubbles up
[20:45:57] <seaworthy> okay so ill going to have differently named input
[20:45:59] <seaworthy> what then?
[20:46:22] <Andrew_R> your second parameter will have to be more generic so it matches all your inputs
[20:46:30] <Andrew_R> maybe just 'input'?
[20:46:39] <seaworthy> what do you mean?
[20:47:14] <Andrew_R> $('#shipping').on('keyup', 'input', function) will run "function" for any keyup event on an 'input' inside of #shipping
[20:48:47] <seaworthy> well i need to know exactly which input i am working with
[20:48:54] <seaworthy> because i need to reuse these values
[20:49:13] <seaworthy> i think i kind of know what i got to do
[20:49:13] <Andrew_R> inside your function, the input that triggered the event will be 'this'
[20:49:14] <seaworthy> thanks
[20:52:44] <seaworthy> hmm i kind of know what you mean tho
[20:53:13] <seaworthy> i am not as proficient to write this that way, i am just gonna do it d"dumb" way
[20:53:21] <seaworthy> for now
[21:01:41] <sam452> Hello, I am trying to swap out the url of a div's background-image using a separate function. This is not working:
[21:01:44] <sam452> $(this).find("background-image").attr("url", toHighlightedBGurl);
[21:02:13] <sam452> I'm trying to find the div's background-image
[21:02:38] <sam452> so the function can swap out the url.
[21:04:07] <awc737> what is the best way to limiting events to certain pages? if ($('#element')) ?
[21:04:57] <awc737> i'm trying to learn proper namespacing/scope/modularity with JS...
[21:05:10] <awc737> I have orders.js, users.js, etc, but I combine it all into one file for production
[21:05:38] <Andrew_R> sam452: you need to specify the syntax just like you would in a CSS style, $(this).css('background-image', ' url(' + toHighlightedBGurl + ')')
[21:07:27] * sam452 studying Andrew_R: 's answer.
[21:07:30] <raj> In my own code, I am being told `ReferenceError: container is not defined`. http://jsfiddle.net/ugjDh/1/
[21:07:41] <raj> I don't even know how that's possible
[21:07:50] <raj> if once I've set a variable, how can it disappear?
[21:09:58] <raj> where are my gurus?
[21:11:04] <Andrew_R> raj: I'm not getting any errors, but nothing is happening either
[21:12:47] <awc737> where my gurus at!? woop woop gurus
[21:12:56] <raj> Andrew_R, console.log()
[21:12:59] <raj> on click
[21:13:05] <raj> of box1 and 2
[21:13:14] <raj> Andrew_R, there are no errors in the fiddle
[21:13:27] <raj> I'm getting errors with similar code
[21:13:31] <raj> well, 1 error
[21:13:38] <Andrew_R> ok, for some reason I wasn't getting anything in the console until I refreshed
[21:13:45] <raj> it says ReferenceError: container is not defined
[21:14:55] <Andrew_R> add your call to "myFunc" with the code that is failing
[21:15:35] <raj> huh?
[21:15:42] <sam452> I'm struggling to target an input:text inside a td of a tr. I want it highlighted when I mouse over the tr (".slide_row td input:text")
[21:16:02] <Andrew_R> the error is probably in the call to myFunc, not in myFunc itself
[21:16:14] <sam452> Or ("tr td input:text")
[21:16:30] <raj> Andrew_R, the call to myFunc is exactly what I have
[21:17:26] <Andrew_R> sam452: it's probably better to just use css for that
[21:18:19] <Andrew_R> tr td input[type=text]:hover { background: red; }

[21:19:19] <YolarP_> http://jsfiddle.net/HeWmc/1/
[21:19:24] <YolarP_> Why doesn't the text turn yellow?
[21:19:29] <YolarP_> Why isn't this working?
[21:19:38] * sam452 considering what Andrew_R: has presented.
[21:20:01] <Andrew_R> raj: I'm not sure, I'd have to see the code that isn't working it in action
[21:21:40] <YolarP_> http://jsfiddle.net/HeWmc/2/
[21:21:44] <YolarP_> Why isn't the text yellow
[21:21:52] <sam452> Andrew_R: unsure what context your answer is. Not in jquery?
[21:22:19] <Andrew_R> yes, not in jQuery
[21:22:56] <Cork> YolarP_: the class is missing from the div
[21:23:11] <YolarP_> yeah i just noticed
[21:23:19] <YolarP_> but i'm having this problem even with a working class on my webpage
[21:23:23] <YolarP_> one sec im going to try to reproduce it
[21:23:26] <Cork> (and please... pick better id names
[21:23:29] <Cork> )
[21:23:43] <Andrew_R> sam452: no need to have the browser do extra work by running javascript code, when it supports it natively with CSS.
[21:23:44] <houser> i have a textarea where i react to keydown in order to find out when the text area becomes dirty. This works well, however it has a problem. It also reacts to arrow keys and home+end and other navigation keys which actually dont change the text. How can i avoid this and only react when the text is changed? (i cannot use change() because that first gets activated once the textarea dont have focus)
[21:29:51] <screamingbanshee> houser: in the callback, test the event against an object map containing only the desired key codes (http://www.cambiaresearch.com/articles/15/javascript-char-codes-key-codes)
[21:29:53] <sam452> Yes, Andrew_R: that should have worked. Even after disabling the JS attempt.
[21:30:39] <houser> screamingbanshee, are those keycodes the same across all devices?
[21:31:11] <screamingbanshee> @_houser You know, I don't actually know
[21:31:37] <screamingbanshee> @_houser part of me wants to say probably, but the rest of me says that would be too easy :P
[21:31:37] <b-ot> screamingbanshee: I am not in probably,.
[21:32:44] <houser> screamingbanshee, well it must be a common problem
[21:33:01] <screamingbanshee> @houser I have no doubt
[21:33:10] <houser> screamingbanshee, so how do ppl solve it
[21:33:19] <screamingbanshee> @houser that is the solution I used when I had a similar problem
[21:33:34] <screamingbanshee> @houser :)
[21:34:03] <raj> before assigning a variable to `undefined`, what is its value?
[21:34:21] <raj> before assigning it to anything
[21:34:38] <raj> Chrome says "ReferenceError: container is not defined"
[21:35:24] <raj> but if I do `container = undefined`, then `container` returns `undefined`
[21:36:04] <Andrew_R> screamingbanshee, houser, that won't solve the problem if the user highlights 1 character and enters the same character again (maybe not really an issue) and the keycode uncertainty...
[21:36:21] <Andrew_R> you could store the last value in memory and check if the new value matches
[21:36:26] <Andrew_R> http://jsfiddle.net/zwumg/
[21:37:08] <Andrew_R> typo http://jsfiddle.net/zwumg/1/
[21:37:45] <YolarP_> OK sorry, here's the real issue: http://jsfiddle.net/HeWmc/14/ and the question is once again, why doesn't my H1 link turn yellow?
[21:38:03] <houser> Andrew_R, your example says its dirty when i press arrowkeys
[21:38:14] <Cork> raj: you can't check the value of a variable that doesn't exist
[21:38:19] <houser> ah
[21:38:24] <houser> now it works
[21:38:26] <Cork> raj: you need to use the typeof command
[21:39:21] <YolarP_> god this error is ticking me off
[21:39:21] <YolarP_> ugh
[21:39:49] <Andrew_R> YolarP_: you forgot to include jQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/HeWmc/15/
[21:40:49] <Andrew_R> YolarP_: well, that was one problem
[21:41:23] <raj> Cork, it's "undefined"
[21:41:32] <YolarP_> the problem still persists
[21:41:33] <raj> but, it's acting as though it was never defined
[21:41:49] <raj> how can a variable get back to that state?
[21:41:57] <Cork> raj: if a plain variable isn't defined, you can't check if it exists
[21:42:01] <raj> i don't explicitly delete any variable
[21:42:06] <Cork> raj: through the == undefined
[21:42:12] <Andrew_R> http://jsfiddle.net/HeWmc/17/
[21:42:15] <YolarP_> OK apparently the CSS is case-sensitive for some reason.
[21:42:16] <Cork> raj: and typeof always return a string
[21:42:25] <Andrew_R> you were adding class 'js' but the style is 'JS'
[21:42:37] <YolarP_> yes
[21:42:38] <Cork> raj: setting an existing variable to undefined shouldn't be a problem though
[21:42:42] <raj> Cork, but if I do `test = undefined`, it returned `undefined` when I type `test` into browser console
[21:42:44] <YolarP_> I did not know that jQuery makes JS case sensitive
[21:42:45] <YolarP_> thanks
[21:42:51] <Cork> raj: sure
[21:43:05] <Cork> ?eval something == undefined
[21:43:08] <bot-t> Cork: ReferenceError: something is not defined
[21:43:16] <Cork> ?eval var something = undefined; something == undefined
[21:43:17] <bot-t> Cork: true
[21:43:29] <raj> hmm
[21:43:31] <raj> interesting
[21:43:42] <coldhead> ?interesting
[21:43:42] <bot-t> Hmm, very interesting https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/6972452864/h754A9258/.gif
[21:43:46] <Cork> ?eval typeof(something) == "undefined"
[21:43:47] <bot-t> Cork: true
[21:44:06] <raj> so how can `something` get back to "ReferenceError: something is not defined` ?
[21:44:12] <Cork> no
[21:44:25] <Cork> cause the name will be created in the reference table
[21:44:34] <Cork> so the parser will know the NAME exists
[21:44:53] <Cork> it still doesn't have a values though
[21:45:15] <raj> `something` can never get back to that?
[21:45:28] <Cork> not unless you never set anything to that name
[21:45:52] <Cork> coldhead: lol
[21:48:20] <Cork> raj: actually thats wrong
[21:48:24] <Cork> at least in some browsers
[21:48:40] <Cork> ?eval var something = 1; delete(something); something == undefined
[21:48:41] <bot-t> Cork: ReferenceError: something is not defined
[21:49:01] <Cork> that removes the name reference
[21:51:07] <Andrew_R> delete isn't supposed to work like that
[21:51:43] <Cork> Andrew_R: it works in spidermonkey and v8 at least
[21:51:56] <Cork> haven't tried presto and jscript
[21:52:38] <Cork> or sunspider for that matter
[21:52:56] <Andrew_R> raj: ignore this, Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Q5LNZ/
[21:53:18] <Andrew_R> you can't delete a global var
[21:53:20] <stendeck> anynone knows backbone here?
[21:55:46] <Cork> hmm interesting
[21:55:59] <Cork> seams it has to do with strict mode
[21:56:22] <Cork> Andrew_R: try running it in a console
[21:56:46] <Andrew_R> yep, get "it didn't work"
[21:57:25] <Cork> well i was a bit surprised when i saw it first, cause i thought it shouldn't work...
[21:57:30] <Cork> now it looks like a bug instead...
[21:57:45] <Cork> heh, and if i set jsfiddle into strict mode i get
[21:57:50] <Cork> SyntaxError: applying the 'delete' operator to an unqualified name is deprecated
[21:57:52] <Cork> >_<
[21:57:58] * Cork don't care anymore
[21:58:21] <Andrew_R> you can delete things from objects though: http://jsfiddle.net/Q5LNZ/1/
[21:58:30] <Cork> ya, i know
[21:58:35] <Cork> and you can use == undefined too
[21:58:45] * Andrew_R doesn't care anymore either (don't use delete and we'll all be ok)
[21:58:56] <Cork> ?eval var a = {}; a.something == undefined
[21:58:56] <bot-t> Cork: true
[21:59:49] <Cork> i just wish browsers implemented a way to trigger page global strict mode...
[22:00:08] <Cork> so freaking annoying having to add it to each response
[22:01:10] <raj> I can't figure out how to trace how my variable gets deleted
[22:01:25] <Cork> raj: what is the original problem?
[22:02:17] <raj> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/ugjDh/2/
[22:02:39] <raj> I can print `container` at page start, but not later
[22:03:09] <Cork> raj: where are you defining container?
[22:03:25] <Cork> or do you mean in the click handler?
[22:03:27] <raj> in myFunc()
[22:03:43] <raj> I can't print it after clicking a box
[22:04:00] <raj> it shows as `ReferenceError: container is not defined`
[22:04:08] <rabbi1> I have 10 <table> with different id... how can i get the id of each <table> element ?
[22:04:46] <Cork> raj: that example works for me though
[22:04:58] <rabbi1> $('table.recording').each(function(index, value){console.log($(this).attr('id'));});  this is giving me all element in the table
[22:05:04] <raj> Cork, exactly, that's why I'm confused
[22:05:20] <raj> so how is it possible for that variable to be deleted?
[22:05:20] <Cork> raj: sounds like a scope problem, or a missing var
[22:05:26] <raj> I have never deleted a variable
[22:05:26] <Cork> its not
[22:06:04] <raj> the click obviously happens after the initialization
[22:06:04] <Cork> rabbi1: $.map($('table.recording'), function(e) { return e.id });
[22:06:11] <raj> so how can it be scope?
[22:06:39] <Cork> raj: it might not be set in a scope that keeps it alive to it gets dropped
[22:06:51] <Cork> there is loads of reasons that it could happen
[22:07:01] <rabbi1> Cork: thanks :)
[22:07:01] <raj> for a variable to be deleteD?
[22:07:04] <Cork> and if nothing else; it could be a pc problem
[22:07:07] <Cork> *gc
[22:07:11] <raj> gc?
[22:07:17] <Cork> Garbage Collection
[22:07:18] <Cork> it
[22:07:24] <raj> hmm
[22:07:28] <raj> but it shouldn't be garbage
[22:07:28] * Cork hates that ' is right beside enter!
[22:07:32] <raj> I just set a listener
[22:07:42] <Cork> it's what cleans up unused memory
[22:07:59] <Cork> raj: ya, that's why i said it could be a gc PROBLEM
[22:08:22] <Cork> but without seeing the code causing it, i can only guess
[22:08:29] <raj> so I should know when garbage is colected?
[22:08:57] <Cork> if the gc isn't bugging data should only be removed when nothing is referencing it
[22:09:41] <Cork> but no, don't start by staring down the bug path
[22:09:49] <Cork> it's most likely not the cause
[22:09:58] <Cork> especially if you can reproduce it in multiple browsers
[22:10:12] <raj> that makes sense
[22:10:14] <raj> :)
[22:10:18] <raj> i usually blame my code anyway
[22:10:36] <raj> so I'm just wondering how this thing can get unscoped when the rest of the variables are available
[22:10:36] <Cork> raj: and that is the correct way to look at things
[22:11:07] <Cork> raj: i would recommend making a copy of the code (and make it static if it's dynamic today)
[22:11:18] <Cork> and then start reducing it as far as you can without the bug going away
[22:11:30] <Cork> that should make it a lot simpler to see the problem
[22:11:59] <Cork> and by simplifying i mean ex. remove css that's not needed, removing html, removing js
[22:12:29] <Cork> and if the problem doesn't make any sense it's normally the fastest way to get to the bottom of it
[22:12:34] <raj> how can it be static if it's a js issue?
[22:12:47] <Cork> raj: i meant remove php out of the picture
[22:12:53] <Cork> remove ajax out of the picture
[22:13:05] <Cork> make it just static html + css + js
[22:13:37] <raj> oh crap
[22:13:38] <Eviltwin> You can probably do this by using your browser's Save Page As functionality
[22:13:39] <raj> I was wrong!
[22:13:40] <Cork> s/remove/take/
[22:13:53] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/ugjDh/3/
[22:14:07] <raj> wait, no
[22:14:12] <raj> there's more
[22:14:41] <Cork> ?
[22:14:49] <Cork> still works for me
[22:16:48] <raj> ok, nm, it's just losing some of the stuff vars defined at the top of myFunc()
[22:17:07] <raj> so it's a scope issue
[22:17:13] <Cork> raj: oh, and by reducing i meant reducing the original page
[22:17:22] <Cork> not the working testcase
[22:17:37] <raj> Cork, i figured :)
[22:20:19] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/vUHFW/
[22:20:24] <Eviltwin> That's an example of a scoping issue
[22:20:42] <Eviltwin> "1 cb: opt2 = b2" instead of "1 cb: opt2 = b1"
[22:21:17] <Cork> Eviltwin: it is, but not the kind raj is looking for
[22:21:28] <sam452> Still struggling with making a image change when I hover over the tr for any kind soul to see? http://jsfiddle.net/sam452/aZmkN/3/
[22:21:31] <Cork> its not overwritten values, its lost values
[22:21:35] <Cork> similar but not same
[22:21:35] <Eviltwin> Ah
[22:21:45] <Eviltwin> An object that's getting overwritten?
[22:22:05] <Cork> Eviltwin: an object that is lost
[22:22:17] <Cork> container == undefined
[22:22:29] <Cork> if i understood the question correct at least
[22:22:45] <raj> but the super undefined, like it was never defined
[22:22:57] <Eviltwin> But you can't reproduce this?
[22:23:07] <raj> yep
[22:23:17] <Cork> Eviltwin: he's still reducing the original page
[22:23:24] <raj> it's just a clickhandler trying to get access to the variable defined by its parent function
[22:23:46] <Cork> sam452: i would strongly recommend having the image in the css, and changing them though classes instead
[22:23:56] <raj> it's a beohemith of a page
[22:24:02] <raj> (sp?)
[22:24:23] <Cork> *behemoth
[22:24:52] <raj> good, now I'll never forget with the shame
[22:24:53] <sam452> Hmm. Are you suggesting through jquery toggle the class?
[22:24:55] <raj> :)
[22:25:00] <Cork> sam452: yes
[22:25:11] <Eviltwin> This is another common problem: http://jsfiddle.net/S2Bay/
[22:25:42] <Eviltwin> "1 cb: options.alpha = a2" vs "1 cb: alpha = a"
[22:25:54] <Eviltwin> When you expect the two to be the same
[22:26:19] <Cork> sam452: it fast becomes nasty when more and more css creeps into the js, cause when you a year down the road need to fix it, it tend to be hard finding where it is
[22:26:38] <Cork> sam452: and you might get relative reference problems and things like that
[22:27:07] <sam452> Working on how to use toggle.
[22:27:40] <sam452> Or really, change class?
[22:27:59] <Cork> sam452: add a class to the cell that holds a spliced image with all the states
[22:28:16] <Cork> and then add/remove a class that changes the image offset (background-position)
[22:28:38] <sam452> Actually, I shouldn't chage class because I have several of these TD and the only change is the b/g url in these three.
[22:28:47] <Cork> and then you have one class for all different states (that can exist at the same time)
[22:29:00] <Cork> sam452: so?
[22:29:03] <sam452> But if I must, I'll double up on the classes.
[22:29:23] <Cork> classes is the cheapest and cleanest way to do it
[22:30:07] <sam452> Ah, I think I see what you're getting at.
[22:33:39] <sam452> Cork, would you suggest I yank the background url style from the original classes and the use the jquery .add the class containing the correct url?
[22:33:51] <sam452> Does that make sense? Cork:?
[22:34:11] <coldhead> Cork?!
[22:34:15] <coldhead> YOU OKAY BUDDY?!
[22:34:16] <Cork> sam452: its up to you
[22:34:23] <coldhead> phew
[22:34:44] <Cork> sam452: depends if it can have a meaning before js does anything
[22:34:58] <Cork> btw for anyone wanting to see another good reason why NOT to use event attributes check http://jsfiddle.net/TAZqR/
[22:36:24] <coldhead> gross
[22:36:32] <Cork> and just to be clear http://jsfiddle.net/TAZqR/2/
[22:36:55] <Cork> there is other pitfall names too
[22:39:43] <sam452> Cork: if I do that won't jquery add the class to the TR and not to the form element inside the TD? Still struggling with targeting nested elements.
[22:40:07] <Cork> sam452: that depends on how you target the element
[22:40:32] <Cork> simplest would prob be to add the class to the tr (.closest('tr').toggleClass('something'))
[22:40:48] <Cork> and then in the css have something like tr.something td.clock {}
[22:40:54] * coldhead nests try/catch statements
[22:52:39] <davesleep> can someone tell me what's wrong with this line?   $(".rowis"+boxids[i]+" #"+batchfield+"").html(batchtext);
[22:52:57] <Cork> missing space?
[22:53:12] <davesleep> it doesnt throwerrors in firebug
[22:53:12] <Cork> anyway there's no need for the first part
[22:53:30] <Cork> $("#"+batchfield) is all you need
[22:53:44] <Cork> id's has to be page globally uniq
[22:53:45] <davesleep> but i want to target a div with class, then a div inside it with id
[22:54:00] <Cork> the id can only exist once
[22:54:04] <davesleep> ah k
[22:54:35] <davesleep> even if the id only exists once inside that class?
[22:54:49] <Cork> that state don't exist
[22:55:12] <Cork> browser has a hash cache for all id's that exist in the page
[22:55:22] <Cork> and that hash can only hold the name once
[22:55:36] <Cork> so if you have two elements with the same id, only the first one will work
[22:55:44] <davesleep> oh i think i get it
[22:55:48] <Cork> (and if you have more then one, the page is invalid)
[22:55:58] <davesleep> ill convert the id to class
[22:56:03] <Cork> yes
[22:56:39] <davesleep> cheers, ill get on it
[22:59:29] <Nobita> hi this is my staging site http://staging.iamknighted.com/ and this is my JS created for the modal layout http://pastebin.com/dZLCFtDg, I've targetted this modal on 3 links on my site, where its working fine with two links where as there is issue only with one link with id #simplemodal-login, where would be the mistake?
[23:00:39] <Cork> Nobita: fyi adding an element selector infront of an id is a good way to slow it down
[23:01:14] <Cork> as that means the browser has to first select all div's on the page, and then reduce it to the one matching the id in the hash
[23:01:18] <chinoto> Would there be any benefit to chunking up a huge dom ready function into several functions that fire on dom ready? See here for example: http://pastebin.com/sFR4BBhN
[23:01:22] <Cork> (instead of just picking the element from the hash)
[23:01:45] <Cork> chinoto: no, it wouldn't
[23:01:57] <Nobita> div#simplemodal-login Cork do yo mean I should try this?
[23:01:59] <Cork> it wouldn't cost much either though
[23:02:16] <Cork> Nobita: no i meant jQuery("div#event").addClass("event"); should be jQuery("#event").addClass("event");
[23:02:25] <Cork> and for all the actions similar to that one
[23:02:43] <chinoto> hm, I figured chunking it up might allow the browser to do whatever work it wants to in between the domready events
[23:02:43] <Nobita> ok
[23:02:55] <Cork> Nobita: (i'm still reading through your code)
[23:03:13] <Cork> chinoto: the event would be triggered in one long chunk anyway
[23:03:27] <Cork> especially as ready isn't really a pure event
[23:03:57] <Cork> Nobita: is it  jQuery('a[name=modal]') that isn't working for that id?
[23:04:04] <chinoto> Cork: really? I thought they just got called sequentially in a way that a browser could interject.
[23:04:31] <Cork> chinoto: ready is a super special function that builds an array of function to call
[23:04:42] <Cork> if has a feature that tracks if ready or load has been triggered
[23:04:43] <chinoto> oh, that would make sense
[23:04:49] <Cork> and if it is it calls all the listeners
[23:05:26] <Cork> chinoto: and either way, event chains is synchronous
[23:05:31] <chinoto> oh, then I guess I'll just toss it all in one function
[23:05:38] <chinoto> except
[23:05:40] <Cork> chinoto: so it fails twice :)
[23:06:12] <chinoto> brb, food
[23:07:42] <Nobita> Cork: so what should I do?
[23:08:51] <coldhead> abandon hope
[23:09:05] <Cork> Nobita: is it  jQuery('a[name=modal]') that isn't working for that id? <-- ?
[23:10:48] <Nobita> Cork: here http://staging.iamknighted.com/ if I'm clicking "JOIN" on top or "SUBSCRIBE" on bottom its working fine i.e the blurred text is coming in and going out as expected but when I click on "SIGN IN" on top its blurr text effect is only coming in not going after the mouse is escaped
[23:11:17] <Cork> Nobita: yes, but what part of the code is related to it?
[23:11:53] <Cork> (i like to know the basics of the mechanics of the page before starting digging through the full page)
[23:17:58] <sam452> I still think I'm not getting to first base because I'm unsure I'm targeting my TR and the div inside the TD element containing the url. ("tr .name-of-class-of-div").
[23:18:34] <Nobita> Cork: sorry it was my mistake, this is the updated JS code http://pastebin.com/dZLCFtDg, please check
[23:18:38] <sam452> Would that skip the TD in between? Probably not, or it's ignoring the TR as you saw in my jsfiddle.
[23:19:09] <Cork> sam452: i don't fully follow
[23:19:24] <Cork> the point was set the class on the tr, and have the class as a parent in the css selector
[23:20:30] <coldhead> on the pillow / in a black fan
[23:22:34] <Cork> Nobita: ok, you're dynamically creating the simplemodal-login element
[23:22:52] <Cork> Nobita: so the selector you run on page start won't find it; and that means the click event won't be bound
[23:23:00] <Nobita> ok
[23:23:23] <Cork> Nobita: so either try using delegated event listener, or bind the handler after you add the element
[23:25:12] <sam452> Sorry, I'm not following. I've read the doc on .closest and it goes up the DOM. I don't want to go higher than TR, I want the tiny div to change inside the TR to befound so I can swap out the class. It's me not grasping.
[23:25:14] <Nobita> thanks Cork , i will try it
[23:25:16] <Nobita> :)
[23:25:58] <sam452> And reading toggleClass seems to not swap a class, but adds to it. The original class has to meansomething by itself.
[23:26:12] <Cork> sam452: uh, might remember wrong, but didn't you have a hover on another element inside the tr?
[23:26:28] <Cork> but ya, if it is on the tr, closest isn't needed
[23:26:35] <sam452> You remember right, that's good.
[23:26:53] <chinoto> Back. Is there any reason to use dom ready on my code when the code comes after all the html tags (except the end tags of body and html)? The only thing I can guess is that certain browsers might not make the dom available to scripts until domready.
[23:27:23] <Cork> chinoto: no if you have the code at the end of the page, you shouldn't use ready
[23:27:25] <coldhead> you're on everything
[23:27:33] <Cork> it even borks in some versions of ie if you do
[23:28:02] <chinoto> Cork: ok, I got a lot of code to change when I finally get around to my js overhaul.
[23:32:23] <sam452> If I was to add or toggle a class, how do I know I'm targeting the right element? That's why I think in my efforts I'm not getting to first base.
[23:33:05] <Cork> sam452: $(this) is the element the event is triggered on
[23:33:25] <Cork> from there you go $(this).closest('tr').toggleClass();
[23:33:30] <Cork> and the css does the rest
[23:35:02] <sam452> Yes, but I'm unsure that $(this) contains what I'm hoping. Perhaps console.log($(this).somecommandthatnamesit) would help?
[23:35:22] <Cork> sam452: do you have the link again?
[23:37:00] <sam452> Oh, yes. http://jsfiddle.net/sam452/aZmkN/3/ I'm hoping I can get your original answer, in the JS window, to work even though it's trying to pull the css. But if I can figure how to swap classes I will.
[23:39:51] <Cork> sam452: on second thought, why not just do http://jsfiddle.net/aZmkN/4/ ?
[23:41:37] <sam452> That seems to WORK.  me figure out what you did, thx!
[23:42:21] <sam452> Ahh, just CSS. Let me dig into that.
[23:43:12] <rabbi1> how to get the id of element having a classname as 'classname' within the element? e.g. <table id="1"> <tr id="a"></tr><tr id="b"></tr>
[23:43:42] <rabbi1> e.g. <table id="1"> <tr id="a" class="classname"></tr><tr id="b"  class="classname"></tr>
[23:43:44] <Cork> $(this).find('.classname').attr('id') ?
[23:43:51] <chuck8> +1
[23:44:21] <Cork> rabbi1: ah you want an array of id's ?
[23:44:26] <rabbi1> i am trying this "$('1').closest('.classname').attr('id');
[23:44:37] <Cork> closest goes up, not in
[23:44:53] <rabbi1> Cork: oops, great.... will have a check
[23:44:54] <Cork> $('1').find('.classname').first().attr('id') ?
[23:45:33] <Cork> or $('1').children('.classname').first().attr('id') ?
[23:46:00] <rabbi1> first () ?
[23:46:24] <Cork> if you only want the first child ya
[23:46:26] <sl33k_> i have some race condition in this code http://bpaste.net/show/Ngw1MkELzA4NgN6vIb6O/ moving nested if block in success handler does not help. any solution?
[23:46:35] <Cork> rabbi1: what is it you want to do?
[23:46:37] <chinoto> what does '1' do in $()?
[23:46:52] <Cork> chinoto: placeholder :)
[23:46:57] <chinoto> oh -_-
[23:47:07] <Cork> cause i don't think 1 is a valid id anyway
[23:47:08] <chinoto> GHEY!
[23:47:51] <rabbi1> Cork: I want to delete an entire <tr> within a <table>... but need to find the id of the <tr> with the id of <table>
[23:48:16] <sl33k_> this is my question https://forum.jquery.com/topic/dropdown-option-only-setting-selected-after-alert . any help appreciated
[23:48:17] <rabbi1> id of <table> is set to a variable
[23:48:28] <Cork> rabbi1: and where are you getting the id from?
[23:48:48] <rabbi1> Cork: dynamic
[23:48:59] <Cork> rabbi1: i meant is the id on the tr or what?
[23:49:32] <Cork> i have a hard time understanding why you need to grab the id from the dom
[23:50:05] <rabbi1> Cork: yeap, id of the tr is dynamic and all tr has a common classname
[23:50:13] <Cork> so why do you need the id?
[23:50:20] <Cork> if you find the tr, just remove it directly
[23:50:37] <rabbi1> each row has a delete, button. so i need to get the id and delete the entire row
[23:50:46] <Cork> so?
[23:51:07] <Cork> $('#delete_button_id').closest('tr').remove()
[23:51:36] <Cork> of it if's from clicking the delete button
[23:51:45] <Cork> $(this).closest('tr').remove()
[23:51:56] <sl33k_> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/dropdown-option-only-setting-selected-after-alert setting selected element in dropdown works only after alert statement
[23:52:00] <sl33k_> what gives?
[23:52:29] <otters> so I want to do a resizable widget and limit left and right *positions* instead of maxWidth/minWidth; is there any easy way to do this?
[23:52:53] <rabbi1> Cork: yeah, i have added the id for the 'delete' element i can just say parent().remove() ? can i ?
[23:52:54] <Cork> sl33k_: the success callback is garanteed to never run before the code you have later there
[23:53:16] <Cork> rabbi1: parent will only go one step, of you want to be sure to grab the tr use closest
[23:53:47] <Cork> sl33k_: so d1 will always be null
[23:54:08] <Cork> sl33k_: so moved your code inside the success callback
[23:54:14] <Cork> and it should work just fine
[23:56:01] <sl33k_> Cork: still no effect as seen here  http://bpaste.net/show/z71Hz0QexPhRGceaXd5P/
[23:57:23] <sl33k_> Cork: always the first index selected no matter what
[23:57:56] <Cork> ah
[23:58:08] <Cork> sl33k_: val() don't work on option
[23:58:22] <Cork> $options.append($("<option />").attr('value', key).text(value))
