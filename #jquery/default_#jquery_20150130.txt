[00:07:39] <sacho_> Cork, firefox and ie don't follow the spec
[00:10:22] <sacho_> well, I'm not 100% sure, but I think they do
[00:10:43] <sacho_> updating image data, even eagerly, is supposed to await the current task's synchronous sections before it begins
[00:10:58] <sacho_> I assume javascript code is a synchronous section though I can't quite find it in the spec
[00:14:57] <Shai_Tan> been a loong day
[00:18:03] <sacho_> yeah, I'm pretty sure they break the spec
[00:53:52] <Mark_2> does anybody know what kind of js parallax plugin this is? http://www.pixedelic.com/themes/geode/
[00:56:51] <drag0nius> how can i wait for ready in script tag received with .load()
[00:57:20] <drag0nius> im loading html along with short js snippets
[00:58:10] <Erwat> drag0nius: the .load function takes 3 arguments
[00:58:16] <Erwat> url, data, complete
[00:58:35] <Erwat> that last argument is a callback function that is called when it's complete
[00:59:00] <drag0nius> the thing is code is loaded along with html
[00:59:14] <drag0nius> not separately
[00:59:42] <Erwat> okay that might be a problem because of what load does
[01:02:45] <drag0nius> can ready launch more than once?
[01:05:52] <Erwat> drag0nius: do you mean document.ready?
[01:06:01] <Erwat> that's a good question
[01:15:59] <stangeland> i have duration in seconds. Is there a module that will pretty-print that in seconds,minutes, hours, days, weeks, years etc. depending on how many seconds there is?
[01:16:23] <Cork> stangeland: you could use the Date object
[01:16:55] <stangeland> Cork, will that automatically decide on a pretty way to print the information?
[01:17:09] <Cork> no
[01:17:25] <Cork> but you can give it the seconds and grab hours/minuts/seconds
[01:17:55] <Cork> but ya, i'm sure there is a time converter lib out there if you just google for it
[01:17:58] <Cork> shouldn't be hard to find
[01:50:48] <drag0nius> how do i convert object to json?
[01:51:20] <Uhkis> parseJSON()
[01:52:12] <Cork> TO json :)
[01:52:28] <Cork> drag0nius: JSON.stringify

[03:02:03] <hrusti> I have table with 4 columns(A,B,C,D). "A" is static number and table must be always orderd by it. "B" is dynamic and I have to update it on different events.
[03:02:43] <hrusti> When event occurs I got A and B value then check if A exists I have to update that row to add up new B to current B and calc C and D
[03:02:59] <hrusti> if doesnt exist I have to insert in table to right spot so table would remain sorted
[03:03:19] <hrusti> "C" column is calculated by A * B and D column is sum of all C values till this row so they have to be updated every time table changes
[03:03:52] <hrusti> How do I insert new row in ordered table and calculate other dependencies with datatables plugin for jQuery?
[03:04:10] <hrusti> I tried with fnPreDrawCallback but I couldnt change order of rows, is it possibe?

[03:06:38] <dupondje> Would there be a reason ajax calls are only executed when my tab has the focus? If I'm working on another tab, I see no ajax calls in firebug, when I put focus on the screen, the ajax calls are running again;
[03:06:46] <dupondje> Its some call that is executed every minute
[03:33:27] <Spaceeman> Hi
[03:36:06] <Omar-> hi
[03:37:25] <Spaceeman> My English is not very good...
[03:37:36] <Spaceeman> Do you know this : http://tablesorter.com/docs/index.html ?
[03:37:42] <Spaceeman> Download failed :(
[03:37:55] <Spaceeman> http://tablesorter.com/__jquery.tablesorter.zip :(
[03:43:38] <Omar-> Spaceeman sorry I dont know about it
[03:49:17] <hrusti> Spaceeman: try http://www.datatables.net/
[04:01:34] <CJHackerz> hello i need help
[04:02:51] <dupondje> odd, firefox doesn't seem to do ajax calls for some reason when the screen doesnt have its focus :s
[04:03:34] <CJHackerz> i am looking for script that can run live audio stream player
[04:06:36] <hackal> Hello I am having trouble trouble selecting first child of type. I am trying to display red box after first paragraph whose parent is div. But it also displays red box after paragraphs in more nested divs. Here is example http://jsfiddle.net/p3v6e0vx/1/
[04:10:19] <Omar-> hackal this? http://jsfiddle.net/p3v6e0vx/2/
[04:10:40] <Cork> hackal: css psudo selectors works like filters not selectors
[04:11:28] <wheeei> is .get more popular and best-practice to use when doing .ajax request even if it doesn't matter if you put in the success snippet into the .ajax?        Just checking what is more commonly used by experienced jQuery devs... I can only see benefits with using .get,  you never risk to forget to check if the request was successful
[04:12:03] <Cork> Omar-: or http://jsfiddle.net/p3v6e0vx/3/ :)
[04:12:27] <Cork> wheeei: $.get is just a wrapper around $.ajax
[04:12:38] <Cork> in the end it is exactly the same thing
[04:13:02] <Spaceeman> Do you know this : http://tablesorter.com/docs/index.html ?
[04:13:06] <Spaceeman> Download failed :(
[04:13:08] <hackal> Omar-: I think my question is badly written. I have div with ID #content. I need to display red box after first paragraph with parent #content. That means you example does exactly opposite. Note that the example code may be different that means I need some general selector.
[04:13:09] <Spaceeman> http://tablesorter.com/__jquery.tablesorter.zip :(
[04:13:09] <wheeei> Cork,  yeah just checking what most experienced devs use... I guess it's .get ?
[04:13:26] <Cork> wheeei: i basically always use $.ajax
[04:13:47] <Cork> it normally doesn't even result in longer lines
[04:14:14] <Cork> hackal: check 3
[04:14:16] <hackal> Omar-: I think I got it right. What do you think? http://jsfiddle.net/p3v6e0vx/4/
[04:15:07] <Spaceeman> How do you sort tables ? (when contents change by ajax)
[04:15:11] <hackal> Cork: I see thank you very much
[04:15:18] <Cork> hackal: if possible avoid using :eq it is much slower then pure css selectors
[04:15:37] <wheeei> Cork, okay, and while we are at it... do you have preference for " vs ' ? :)
[04:16:00] <Cork> wheeei: from legacy (js in attributes) i always use ' in js
[04:16:08] <Cork> but now days it doesn't really matter
[04:16:45] <Spaceeman> I like C++... So, I use " for string and ' for char...
[04:16:58] <Cork> would be fine if js had char :)
[04:17:06] <wheeei> Cork,  ok, yeah I think ' is cleaner in JS code as well, just getting annoyed on tutorials changing it up from the slides to the examples (try.jquery.com)
[04:17:25] <Spaceeman> String of one char as char ;)
[04:17:39] <Cork> wheeei: it is soon to get better es6 sprotes `` :)
[04:17:55] <wheeei> wheeei, ?
[04:17:59] <wheeei> Cork,  ? :)
[04:18:16] <wheeei> ecmascript6?
[04:18:16] <Cork> es6 has '', "" and `` as strings
[04:18:18] <Cork> ya
[04:18:25] <Cork> though the last one is a bit special
[04:18:26] <Spaceeman> How do you sort tables ? (when contents change by ajax)
[04:18:46] <Spaceeman> Do you know this : http://tablesorter.com/docs/index.html ?
[04:19:43] <wheeei> Cork, haha okay :) took a while to find `` on my keyboard :P
[04:20:22] <Cork> wheeei: its for substitution strings (don't remember the term they used)
[04:20:31] <Cork> where you can build strings with variables in them
[04:20:41] <wheeei> ah okay, like " " in PHP
[04:20:53] <Cork> ya
[04:20:54] <wheeei> never liked that
[04:21:14] <Cork> ah, there we go
[04:21:16] <Cork> template strings https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/template_strings
[04:21:49] <DRSK> Does anyone know how to filter: blur using TweenMax?
[04:22:01] <hackal> I have a jquery function doing something for .each('h2'). Is there a way to run function when no h2 are found? http://jsfiddle.net/omahvk9p/
[04:22:36] <Cork> hackal: you would have to check if there isn't any in the result
[04:23:02] <Cork> var match = $().find().each(func); if(match.length < 1) {}
[04:45:03] <Erwat> hey Cork when i iterate over an array with forEach can i change the elements of the array at the same time and then have a final array?
[04:45:13] <Erwat> it's just a quesiton of making it pretty i guess
[04:45:29] <WhereIsMySpoon> Ok wtf..Im doing a very very simple jquery ajax request: http://pastie.org/9873773 and im getting an error in my server log that "myurl.htmid=myvar" is a 404, which of course it is, it should have a question mark after the .htm
[04:58:13] <WhereIsMySpoon> Im doing a very very simple jquery ajax request: http://pastie.org/9873773 and im getting an error in my server log that "myurl.htmid=myvar" is a 404, which of course it is, it should have a question mark after the .htm...anyone got any ideas whats going on please?
[05:04:17] <Omar-> WhereIsMySpoon url: "myurl.htm?",
[05:11:42] <WhereIsMySpoon> Omar-: sorry, url: "/myurl.htm"
[05:12:03] <WhereIsMySpoon> its just a spring controller
[05:19:18] <MikeD_> anyone here familiar with the .sparkline plugin?

[06:28:51] <Lone_Rifle> hello.. what DOM events are triggered when $("#someId").html(content) is called? I intend to inject my own elements into content. That quoted line of javascript lives in source beyond my control.
[06:31:15] <BillCriswell> Lone_Rifle: That wouldn't trigger any events. Are you waiting for content in there to finish loading?
[06:32:15] <Lone_Rifle_> BillCriswell: correct
[06:32:58] <BillCriswell> Lone_Rifle: Is there images or is it just plain html?
[06:33:15] <Lone_Rifle> the latter
[06:33:51] <mbrzuzy> Lone_Rifle, http://api.jquery.com/load/ might help you
[06:35:56] <Lone_Rifle> mbrzuzy: how? i'm trying to act when the element gets mutated. from what i read in that URL, load will fetch something and invoke a callback.
[06:36:28] <Lone_Rifle> addendum: no control over the line of javascript i quoted when i joined this channel
[06:37:51] <wiggl3> Hello children
[06:37:53] <wiggl3> Can someone help me make this JS/CSS slideshow behaves equally well for all widths? http://jsfiddle.net/wiggl3/j2xqumpj/
[06:38:58] <mbrzuzy> Lone_Rifle: I'm not sure.  It's hard to say without more information on what you're trying to do.  I mean, once the content is fetched, writing to the DOM will be quick
[06:40:02] <Lone_Rifle> mbrzuzy: okay, so I'm writing a Chrome extension that injects a page with scripts that i've written, which in turn inject the page with various content
[06:41:09] <Lone_Rifle> $("#id").html(fetchedContent) is currently overwriting the part of the DOM which i've modified, so i want to act after the DOM has been modified to reapply my content
[06:42:58] <BillCriswell> Lone_Rifle: If it's just plain html you can just run whatever you want on it after .html()
[06:43:00] <BillCriswell> .html() is sync.
[06:43:26] <Lone_Rifle> yes, i get that, the problem is i cannot modify the source file where that particular html() line is in
[06:43:48] <MikeD_> sounds shady (just sayin)
[06:44:13] <Lone_Rifle> MikeD_: Chrome extensions that manipulate the DOM are not that uncommon, last I heard
[06:45:01] <MikeD_> heh, i know... but you know people ask for help injecting scripts into other people's pages (and such)
[06:45:56] <Lone_Rifle> MikeD_: which i was told about on this channel yesterday.
[06:46:04] <Lone_Rifle> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9263671/google-chome-application-shortcut-how-to-auto-load-javascript/9310273#9310273
[06:46:37] <BillCriswell> Lone_Rifle: Sure you can.
[06:46:52] <BillCriswell> Oh wait I see what you're saying now.
[06:46:55] <BillCriswell> brb
[06:46:59] <Lone_Rifle> BillCriswell: well, i'm listening...
[06:47:30] <Lone_Rifle> i see that webkit provides MutationObservers, i'll see what i can do with that.
[06:55:20] <BillCriswell> Lone_Rifle: Going to try something...
[06:57:30] <Cork> man why is this suddenly such a common question
[06:57:39] <Cork> this is the forth time in 2-3 days
[06:58:02] <Cork> Lone_Rifle: do the code need to be cross browser?
[06:58:19] <WhereIsMySpoon> Im doing a very very simple jquery ajax request: http://pastie.org/9873992 and im getting an error in my server log that "/myurl.htmid=myvar" is a 404, which of course it is, it should have a question mark after the .htm...anyone got any ideas whats going on please?
[06:58:24] <Lone_Rifle> Cork: Chrome extension, so unlikely
[06:58:41] <Cork> Lone_Rifle: ah, i would definitely use the mutationobserver then
[06:58:53] <Cork> its a fairly clean solution
[06:59:19] <Cork> just watch for the child tree option
[06:59:27] <BillCriswell> Cork: Would it be possible do do something like $.fn.html = function (html) { return $(this).html(html).trigger('loaded'); }); or something along those lines?
[06:59:43] <Cork> BillCriswell: yes, but only if all parts use jquery
[06:59:49] <Cork> mutation observer is a cleaner solution
[07:00:51] <BillCriswell> Cork: Agreed.
[07:00:58] <Cork> Lone_Rifle: so a mutation observer for childList on the element $().html() is run on will work fine
[07:01:30] <Lone_Rifle> yea, looks like it. thanks for the hints.
[07:02:02] <Cork> i've done the same from plenty of userscripts :)
[07:02:15] <Cork> so i know it works well
[07:02:39] <Cork> it can be a little tricky with old and new attributes
[07:02:50] <Cork> but child nodes should be straight forward
[07:14:14] <prohobo> i dont like javascript but i like it
[07:14:17] <prohobo> what do
[07:17:28] <klusias> hello. i got plugin, which maps some data to element. how can i remove/unbind all javascripts related to my element?
[07:21:36] <WhereIsMySpoon> Can anyone -please- help me with this ajax issue? Im just kinda getting ignored :(
[07:23:12] <ncls> hi
[07:23:42] <Mark_2> um,
[07:24:04] <Mark_2> how can i emulate this side panel’s colorpicker function? http://www.elegantthemes.com/preview/Divi/page-left-sidebar/
[07:24:16] <ncls> will $(xml).find("#387") work to get the element with ID 387 in a XML doc or should I use $(xml).find("tag[id=387]") ?
[07:27:45] <cordovafan8> Hello again all. I am having an issue (again) where dialog('close') hangs the 'parent' page. I open the dialog with a mobile.changePage to an external html (ie ajax load). Everything works fine until I click the confirm button, which does a dialog('close'). This causes the page I'm navigating back to from the dialog to 'freeze' for several seconds.
[07:28:56] <ncls> auto-response : yes, it works
[07:29:05] <Omar-> hi cordovafan8
[07:31:14] <Omar-> cordovafan8 is dialog the first page? or you open it from within another page?
[07:37:58] <cordovafan8> Omar-: sorry I went afk. The dialog is not the first page currently (I had tried that solution last week, and can't find a way to remove it from the history, so I've moved away from it). It is an external html file which I load via mobile.changePage during the pageshow event of the first page.
[07:38:43] <Mark_2> does anybody know how to make a color picker that sends color value to the div (changes text color for example) like this website ? http://www.elegantthemes.com/preview/Divi/page-left-sidebar/#
[07:38:53] <cordovafan8> Omar-: I've tried to have the dialog in the same html file as the first page (index.html), but I have had no success in getting it to show correctly (mobile.changePage('#dialog') does nothing) This is on jquery 1.3.1 by the way
[07:41:46] <vovvawrk> Why don't this return "done" in the console? $.ajax({ type:"GET", dataType:"jsonp", url:'http://cvrapi.dk/api?search=123&country=dk', success: function(b){colsole.log('success')}}).done(function(data){ console.log('done');});;
[07:44:32] <ntcbow> colsole.log
[07:44:43] <hlvwrk> coleslaw is gross.
[07:45:48] <vovvawrk> ntcbow :) but thats not on the done function
[07:46:22] <ntcbow> script execution will stop at the error
[07:46:34] <ntcbow> did you correct it?
[07:46:57] <vovvawrk> ntcbow: yes
[07:47:04] <ntcbow> still no done?
[07:47:08] <vovvawrk> yes
[07:47:28] <ntcbow> but the request finished?
[07:48:00] <ntcbow> and theres a trailing semicolon
[07:48:14] <ntcbow> 2 there  are 2
[07:48:29] <vovvawrk> i get only this in the console: GET http://cvrapi.dk/api?search=123&country=dk&callback=jQuery17108787020018789917_1422630264301&_=1422632833025
[07:48:33] <vovvawrk> in red :)
[07:48:43] <ntcbow> then the request failed
[07:48:59] <ntcbow> there's a error function instead of done
[07:49:02] <ntcbow> use that
[07:49:15] <vovvawrk> tryed, no difference
[07:49:40] <vovvawrk> even the url do give json content
[07:49:43] <shoky> error callback doesn't work for JSONP requests
[07:50:11] <vovvawrk> shoky: then how can i detect if i get an error?
[07:50:16] <ntcbow> add .fail(function() {...
[07:50:50] <vovvawrk> ntcbow: don't work
[07:50:54] <ntcbow> or .always(function() { instead of .done
[07:51:21] <vovvawrk> ntcbow: don't work..
[07:51:30] <shoky> vovvawrk i think you can only use a timeout
[07:52:33] <vovvawrk> shoky: just use i timer to check if the result comes or not?
[07:53:16] <shoky> vovvawrk: $.ajax has a "timeout" option. it'll trigger the error handler if it times out, with a status of "timeout"
[07:53:26] <vovvawrk> its strange, for the url do result in an json styled error message
[07:53:37] <shoky> no, the url results in an http 404 error
[07:53:51] <vovvawrk> i get: {"error":"NOT_FOUND","t":0,"version":6}
[07:53:56] <vovvawrk> from: http://cvrapi.dk/api?search=123&country=dk
[07:54:23] <shoky> oh
[07:54:39] <vovvawrk> but looks like jQusery get a 404 :/
[07:54:47] <vovvawrk> jQuery*
[07:58:05] <shoky> vovvawrk it's a 404 with a body. when you fetch it with JSONP you don't see the body because JSONP is just a <script> tag
[07:59:15] <Omar-> cordovafan8 i was afk too
[07:59:28] <Omar-> you can use dialig inside a page, use a popup instead
[08:07:30] <Omar-> cordovafan8 sorry, you can't
[08:07:47] <Omar-> dialog is a page, you cant have page inside a page
[08:14:57] <matthew_b> would anyone mind helping me with window.open and Safari blocking the popup?
[08:17:29] <gnarf> jsonp must return 200's server side
[08:17:36] <gnarf> or the script wont execute
[08:18:01] <cordovafan8> Omar-: could I remove the main page, then reinstate it after the dialog?
[08:18:02] <gnarf> also if that {"error"}... wasn't surrounded in a jsonpcallback()
[08:18:10] <gnarf> that doesn't talk jsonp either
[08:18:30] <gnarf> you need to use regular old json, same origin, or proxy it server side most likely
[08:23:58] <shoky> his api it surrounds it with a callback but still returns a 404.. silly
[08:26:35] <MisterMartian> Hey anyone around?
[08:27:34] <vovvawrk> shoky: Timeout worked :) But i may be faster to check if the url returns 404 on beforehand?
[08:27:37] <Omar-> cordovafan8 manipulating history isn't an easy job
[08:27:50] <Omar-> you can prevent user from navigating back to a dialog page
[08:28:37] <Omar-> cordovafan8 http://stackoverflow.com/a/27368187
[08:29:38] <shoky> vovvawrk: if you have a way to check that, cross-domain, sure why not
[08:29:51] <MisterMartian> http://jsfiddle.net/Leyh351L/2/ im trying to return url which is nested within .done, i tried defining a variable outside of it to return but no luck, is there anyway to do this?
[08:32:29] <shoky> MisterMartian: you must access that data from inside a callback. using promises makes it nice:
[08:32:34] <shoky> MisterMartian: http://jsfiddle.net/Leyh351L/2/
[08:32:57] <birdsfly23> hi there. any suggests for a super leightweight ajax/rest library? thanks
[08:33:57] <Omar-> cordovafan8 $.mobile.urlHistory instead of $.mobile.navigate.history
[08:34:02] <Omar-> for jQM 1.3
[08:34:19] <MisterMartian> How does a callback work? Sorry I'm fairly new to this. Also I don't think the link you sent was edited
[08:35:18] <Lhugber> hello someone know if are there some game channel?
[08:35:20] <shoky> MisterMartian: sorry. http://jsfiddle.net/Leyh351L/3/
[08:35:24] <Lhugber> or xbox channel?
[08:36:05] <MisterMartian> ahh! neato, thanks :)
[08:38:44] <Omar-> Lhugber /list *xbox*
[08:41:05] <hrusti> http://jsfiddle.net/ayL3vqku/9/ how to add/update data to table?
[08:41:18] <hrusti> so this will work as it should
[08:59:47] <MisterMartian> Hey i'm back again, http://jsfiddle.net/zjm3qvhd/ My array of photos does not appear in order, so I tried adding a placeholder element dynamically, but now they don't show at all, what am I doing wrong?
[09:03:18] <cordovafan8> Omar-: the only case where I want to remove a page from history is if the dialog is the first page. If I can do that the way you suggest I will be very happy. I will try it
[09:05:13] <Omar-> cordovafan8 the code in this http://stackoverflow.com/a/27368187 will prevent from navigating back to dialog.
[09:06:31] <Omar-> another simple option is to navigate without ajax to index.html e.g. on clicking confirm button, window.location.href = "index.html"
[09:06:49] <iaj> c
[09:06:57] <Omar-> the framework will be initalized as new and dialog is not longer in jQM history
[09:09:12] <cordovafan8> Omar-: I really like that idea. I'll give it a shot.
[09:09:27] <Omar-> cordovafan8 good luck
[09:09:42] <Es0teric> if i wanted to check if a <p> tag is empty but theres multiple <p> tags inside of a div, how would i accomplish that?
[09:10:15] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric do you care if it's a particular one, or only if any of them are empty?
[09:10:23] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: any of them that are empty
[09:10:46] <robertmaxrees> could do something like a .filter().length check.
[09:11:00] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: right but how do i collect all the <p> tags and check against them?
[09:11:25] <robertmaxrees> if $('div').find('p').filter(function() { return $(this).text().length > 0 }).length
[09:11:35] <robertmaxrees> you select them like you do anything else.
[09:16:37] <Es0teric> alright so robertmaxrees if i wanted to target the one whos length == 0
[09:16:48] <Es0teric> i cant do $(this).remove() right?
[09:16:53] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[09:17:52] <robertmaxrees> where would you use the $(this)?
[09:18:01] <robertmaxrees> !api filter
[09:18:02] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .filter(): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test.  http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[09:18:11] <robertmaxrees> check this out ^
[09:19:14] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Hm, there's an :empty() selector lol
[09:19:22] <BillCriswell> Er, minus the ( and ).
[09:19:38] <BillCriswell> $('p:empty')
[09:19:55] <robertmaxrees> that's another way.  i still prefer the non-selector approach personally.
[09:20:11] <BillCriswell> Yeah I don't like getting all nuts with my selectors either.
[09:20:21] <BillCriswell> I'm filter whenever I can.
[09:20:41] <robertmaxrees> there was a great example i saw the other day that used some seemingly innocuous selectors and it absolutely killed page performance
[09:20:59] <Es0teric> BillCriswell, robertmaxrees $('.single-article').find('p').filter( function() { return $(this).text().length == 0; }).remove(); <— that did the trick
[09:21:08] <robertmaxrees> :)
[09:21:13] <robertmaxrees> use === btw
[09:22:07] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: got it, thanks
[09:33:19] <cryptopsy> got an accordion which is the height of the image, but it doesnt' fill its height (as reported in firebug), i've tried a bunch of stuff. You can see at cpov.info, please help me by providing a short hack, or some ideas i can try
[09:36:48] <cordovafan8> Omar-: so the window.location.href works wonders BUT, now I have an ugly white screen flash after I dismiss the dialog (while my index.html is loading)
[09:38:03] <robertmaxrees> you could calculate the height of the parent container minus the current height of all of the accordions,  then add that height to the currently selected group, cryptopsy.  that's the hacky way to do that.
[09:39:05] <BillCriswell> Accordions are only OK at weirdal.com
[09:39:11] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[09:39:14] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell++
[09:39:45] <BillCriswell> They're my least favorite design pattern by far.
[09:39:49] <robertmaxrees> that'd be a fun project - a karma bot that we preload with all the logs.
[09:40:08] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Agreed. Wonder how far the public jQuery logs go.
[09:40:15] <BillCriswell> I can't believe I'm too lazy to look that up.
[09:40:19] <BillCriswell> It would tkae like... 2 minutes.
[09:40:22] <BillCriswell> If that.
[09:40:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah i never really got why people are so into accordions.  same with carousels - always feels like people are trying to shove more stuff into small areas than they need.
[09:40:32] <robertmaxrees> whitespace is OK.
[09:40:49] <robertmaxrees> 2011-05-11
[09:40:55] <BillCriswell> Holy smokes.
[09:41:06] <robertmaxrees> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/%23jquery_20110511.log.html
[09:41:10] <robertmaxrees> that's the oldest available log.
[09:41:20] <BillCriswell> I'm not in there.
[09:41:26] <BillCriswell> Wonder when I first show up.
[09:41:35] <BillCriswell> systemfault is in there lol
[09:41:42] <BillCriswell> No duch
[09:41:45] <Omar-> cordovafan8 this is because you're navigating to a fresh framework
[09:42:05] <Omar-> cordovafan8 another option is, using a popup instead of dialog
[09:42:28] <Omar-> a popup embedded in index/first page
[09:42:41] <robertmaxrees> http://kingjamesprogramming.tumblr.com/post/109203488447/but-they-canoe-much-too-hard-these-thieves-they sometimes this thing produces some magical results.
[09:42:55] <BillCriswell> Looks like 2011-06-20 for me haha
[09:43:09] <robertmaxrees> wow. you've been here a while.
[09:43:41] <BillCriswell> I'm tring to remember when I switched my nick.
[09:43:45] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: ok ~ first let me see if setting height manually does anything, because i don't think it does
[09:43:56] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy you should be able to with JS
[09:44:16] <cryptopsy> i could calculate the height but then what
[09:44:26] <robertmaxrees> a straight .height() call on the contents of that particular accordion, assuming i understand what you mean by "expand to fit"
[09:44:49] <cryptopsy> i set height=1000px; on the accordion line and it didn't expand to that size
[09:45:02] <cryptopsy> so i don't know how to progress with the suggestion you made
[09:45:07] <robertmaxrees> do you have that slightly nsfw picture on your site?
[09:45:10] <cryptopsy> n
[09:45:12] <cryptopsy> black square
[09:45:47] <robertmaxrees> did you set the height via your stylesheets?  because that won't work.
[09:46:20] <robertmaxrees> have to do it in JS after it's expanded.
[09:46:28] <robertmaxrees> brb meeting.
[09:46:34] <cryptopsy> the height was with flex
[09:46:47] <cryptopsy> i don't know what you're asking ... just look at the code? don't know how to make it simpler
[09:47:11] <cryptopsy> ah .. the height i height:100vh; on the container
[09:51:22] <robertmaxrees> back
[09:51:25] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:51:31] <robertmaxrees> no.  one sec.
[09:54:22] <cordovafan8> Omar-: is it possible to make it look like a dialog though? Every time I try it I cannot make the background page disappear
[09:55:38] <Omar-> cordovafan8 you can hide page content when "popup" is open
[09:55:44] <Omar-> and show it once closed
[10:02:57] <frabbler_> Hey. I have a json file. I only want to load three items at a time on click of a button
[10:03:10] <frabbler_> how do you iterate through a json file 3 at a time
[10:03:20] <robertmaxrees> set a manual counter.
[10:03:26] <robertmaxrees> and use a forEach or something similar.
[10:07:16] <BillCriswell> frabbler_: slice off what you need.
[10:07:21] <BillCriswell> and keep an index on where to start
[10:08:08] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy http://fixee.org/paste/yfobulq/ not perfect (ie doesn't set it to the exact same height), but you get the general ide.a
[10:08:52] <robertmaxrees> should be pretty trivial to take it from there.
[10:09:56] <BillCriswell> frabbler_: It would be like items.slice(0, 3), firs three, items.slice(3, 3), etc
[10:10:12] <robertmaxrees> .slice() only works on arrays, right?
[10:10:15] <frabbler_> hm
[10:10:29] <frabbler_> so i would need to define the slices like that
[10:10:45] <frabbler_> it's a dynamic amount of items
[10:10:48] <icjs> hi, can anyone help get jquery working from a chrome extension?
[10:11:26] <BillCriswell> I missed up slice.
[10:11:39] <BillCriswell> .slice(0, 3) .slice(3, 6) etc
[10:11:52] <BillCriswell> frabbler_: Just up an index when you need the next three.
[10:12:38] <frabbler_> like this
[10:12:39] <frabbler_> http://jsfiddle.net/8r8cgycm/
[10:12:39] <frabbler_> >
[10:12:55] <robertmaxrees> what does the data look like?
[10:13:14] <BillCriswell> frabbler_: No, you'd use slice on the response from the json call.
[10:13:25] <BillCriswell> frabbler_: You're getting them all at once, right?
[10:13:31] <frabbler_> yes
[10:13:43] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: i set height manually on accordion and it didn't visuallyt change
[10:14:01] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy did you look at the code i sent you?
[10:14:06] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to set the height on .accordion.
[10:14:26] <robertmaxrees> you want it on the active content group
[10:15:00] <BillCriswell> frabbler_: Are you trying to put them all out to the page in different html blocks or are you replacing a block over and over
[10:15:01] <BillCriswell> ?
[10:15:15] <frabbler_> im trying to load 4 on page load
[10:15:18] <frabbler_> then click a button
[10:15:26] <frabbler_> and be able to load another 4
[10:15:30] <frabbler_> so instead of 4 items
[10:15:33] <frabbler_> there would be 8
[10:17:40] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[10:17:51] <BillCriswell> One second and I'll show you how I'd approach it.
[10:17:58] <BobFrankly> <span class="uniqueID"><span class="non-uniqueID"></span></span>     <----trying to build a selector to get at the non-unique span within a unique span....
[10:18:09] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: yes
[10:18:23] <robertmaxrees> $('.uniqueID').find('.non-uniqueID');
[10:18:31] <robertmaxrees> or just $('.uniqueID .non-uniqueID');
[10:18:43] <BobFrankly> sometimes it's just too dang simple :D
[10:18:49] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy pop it into your console after the page loads
[10:19:03] <robertmaxrees> it's a P.O.C. - basic idea.  won't work out of the box.
[10:19:35] <cryptopsy> isn't .height just the same as setting height in css
[10:19:39] <BobFrankly> thanks robertmaxrees, that works :D
[10:19:45] <frabbler_> thanks bill
[10:20:03] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy you can't do what you want in CSS because the accordion setup is overriding styles inline.
[10:20:08] <robertmaxrees> which breaks cascade.
[10:20:15] <frabbler_> i will be back on 20 minutes billcriswell
[10:20:17] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: i knew that
[10:20:33] <robertmaxrees> then what are you asking?
[10:20:43] <cryptopsy> what's .height actually doing
[10:21:03] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/height/#height2
[10:21:10] <robertmaxrees> sets the css height of the element.
[10:21:29] <cryptopsy> accordion can take the height of a div, so why can't it respect the div being the same height as the image?
[10:21:41] <robertmaxrees> because it's autosizing to the content.
[10:22:04] <cryptopsy> that's not necessarily a bad thing, autosize it to the height of the div, which is the sae height as the image, im master-slave relationship
[10:22:33] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/zipuxuyili/1/edit?html,js,output
[10:22:37] <robertmaxrees> just tellin' you what you have to work with in your case.
[10:22:37] <BillCriswell> Oh, duh, not here.
[10:24:11] <cryptopsy> so i don't understand how autosize works exactly
[10:24:19] <cryptopsy> what rules does it have to respect ?
[10:25:26] <cryptopsy> basically heightStyle in 1.9 or later
[10:25:35] <robertmaxrees> what version are you working with?
[10:25:46] <cryptopsy> the latest since a month ag
[10:25:47] <cryptopsy> ago
[10:25:52] <robertmaxrees> heightStyleType: "fill"
[10:25:58] <robertmaxrees> had you not yet tried this?
[10:26:02] <cryptopsy> i have tried this
[10:26:16] <robertmaxrees> try it again real quick...
[10:26:33] <cryptopsy> i just pushed
[10:26:52] <robertmaxrees> "fill"
[10:26:53] <robertmaxrees> not true
[10:27:06] <cryptopsy> oh i see, 1 moment
[10:27:07] <robertmaxrees> api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#option-heightStyle
[10:27:54] <cryptopsy> you said heightStyleType though
[10:28:04] <robertmaxrees> follow the docs.
[10:28:07] <robertmaxrees> my bad.
[10:28:15] <cryptopsy> its like in the docs now
[10:28:38] <robertmaxrees> "fille"
[10:28:42] <cryptopsy> damnit 1 moment
[10:28:42] <robertmaxrees> *"fill"
[10:28:45] <robertmaxrees> with quotes.
[10:29:15] <cryptopsy> is ok?
[10:30:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah, your css is all sideways.
[10:30:40] <robertmaxrees> so you either get to work with my hack, or refactor your CSS>
[10:30:52] <cryptopsy> what's wrong with the css?
[10:31:20] <cryptopsy> its like going in circles, what do i tell a css expert if i'm looking for help
[10:31:29] <robertmaxrees> inline styles, using vh, unnecessary flexbox use.
[10:31:29] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[10:31:43] <robertmaxrees> i tried to help you the other day and all you did was insult me sooo
[10:31:48] <cryptopsy> ok, i have the index.html from 3 days ago without flex
[10:31:55] <robertmaxrees> good luclk.
[10:32:13] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: essentially what's going on is you're spitting in my face by telling me to rework something that was done, just so you know, its not personal
[10:32:28] <robertmaxrees> i gave you an almost fully functioning solution.
[10:32:28] <Palaver> Billcriswell you therealklanni
[10:32:37] <Palaver> There*
[10:32:46] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: am not sure its functional
[10:32:51] <cryptopsy> its quite cute in theory
[10:32:52] <robertmaxrees> i'm not spitting in your face - i have given you workable solutions and helped you, even with your attitude.  good luck.
[10:32:55] <cryptopsy> just like 'height'
[10:33:07] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: you know, it take time to implement every suggestion given on irc
[10:33:09] <cryptopsy> hours
[10:33:19] <cryptopsy> i gotta fully look up every component's doc
[10:33:28] <robertmaxrees> please PM me if you have more concerns.  thanks!
[10:33:36] <cryptopsy> depends, what concerns
[10:33:41] <cryptopsy> techincal concerns?
[10:33:45] <robertmaxrees> any :)
[10:34:08] <BillCriswell> Palaver: I don't knowwho that is.
[10:34:27] <Palaver> Its brett
[10:34:29] <cryptopsy> there are only 2 other solutions i have discovered in css: block, and float, and i have both files
[10:34:37] <Palaver> Frabblerock
[10:34:41] <cryptopsy> heightStyle:"fill" doesn't work in both
[10:35:19] <cryptopsy> css obligations are not discussed in the API
[10:35:25] <BillCriswell> Palaver: Oh.
[10:35:28] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/zipuxuyili/1/edit?html,js,output
[10:35:31] <BillCriswell> There you go.
[10:36:49] <Palaver> Thanks ler me check it out
[10:38:48] <Palaver> Perfect!
[10:38:53] <Palaver> Thank you!
[10:39:51] <pantsofchocolate> haha i love when people come in ask a question get answered and leave, its so efficient
[10:40:03] <Frabblerock> Thanks so much
[10:40:10] <BobFrankly> Hey...I stuck around for a few minutes
[10:40:20] <Ghuigf> someone here could help me with one topic og xobox games?
[10:40:25] <Ghuigf> xbox channel doesn't works
[10:40:29] * BobFrankly finds his mouse hovering over the "close" button
[10:41:01] <islalobo> Hello, I'm using colorbox plugin and I'm trying to prevent it from closing until the submit button is hit: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/16458116f89c16bc527c
[10:41:04] <robertmaxrees> Ghuigf errr, you could try i guess?  probably won't have much success.
[10:42:19] <pantsofchocolate> islalobo, arent you recursively calling that close function? you are saying hey when the colorbox closes check if the button is pressed to close it
[10:42:49] <BillCriswell> Frabblerock: No problem. Does it make sense?
[10:42:59] <Frabblerock> Yeah
[10:43:39] <islalobo> pantsofchocolate: I don't follow you
[10:43:52] <pantsofchocolate> you are attaching to the closing of the colorbox are you??
[10:44:19] <pantsofchocolate> $.colorbox.close({}) is binding your function to when it closes? not when the button is pressed which is the important action here
[10:44:40] <Ghuigf> robertmaxrees : never has requested my questions
[10:46:13] <islalobo> pantsofchocolate: isn't it happening when the button #submit-optin-options is clicked?
[10:47:51] <pantsofchocolate> well isnt that just a recursive call? the code you have, you declare the variable equal to the function, you create the function and if you pressed the button you call the variable which calls the function
[10:48:17] <islalobo> pantsofchocolate: I got it from the plugin documentation though
[10:48:31] <pantsofchocolate> show me that so i can look at it
[10:48:41] <islalobo> pantsofchocolate:  http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/faq/#faq-close
[10:50:23] <pantsofchocolate> how does it work right now for you does it close if you click the submit? or close without clicking it?
[10:50:30] <pantsofchocolate> i think you are missing a return in that case
[10:50:36] <frabbler_> billcriswell what does done do
[10:50:48] <islalobo> pantsofchocolate:  it popup and then stays for a few seconds and then closes on its own
[10:50:59] <BillCriswell> frabbler_: It's the same as $.getJSON('foo', function (result)  {});  for the most part.
[10:55:53] <islalobo> pantsofchocolate: with return https://gist.github.com/anonymous/fe2cb6b9ddc584c2c38c
[10:56:06] <axilla> hey all, i have this code I wrote to create "infinite scroll" but when someone scrolls really fast and reaches the bottom before the ajax content has loaded it will sometimes load the same content multiple times(i'm assuming because they're spaming the .load_more button). https://gist.github.com/travisdmathis/de1a6b5aab140a69bc5c
[10:56:11] <axilla> how can I prevent that?
[10:57:01] <robertmaxrees> set a var that checks to see if there's already an ajax load running and, if so, don't make another call.
[10:57:10] <robertmaxrees> basically, disable the ajax load.
[10:58:28] <pantsofchocolate> islalobo: that doesnt help?
[10:58:44] <islalobo> pantsofchocolate: nope
[10:58:48] <islalobo> :/
[10:59:27] <axilla> ahh thanks robert
[10:59:28] <pantsofchocolate> islalobo: you are also missing a parenthesis in the newest one i think
[11:02:53] <pantsofchocolate> islalobo: also why does that need to be in an if statement? the onclick should take care of the if the action occurs
[11:03:39] <islalobo> pantsofchocolate: oh, I had it not as an if statement, but when it wasn't working I tried it.You're right that it doens't have to be
[11:04:34] <pantsofchocolate> also is cbox_closed the name of the object or is it an id or class?
[11:05:16] <islalobo> but without the if statement where do I put the return?
[11:05:32] <pantsofchocolate> under it
[11:05:47] <pantsofchocolate> it would block the function wihtout the click so it just returns nothing so nothing happens
[11:07:59] <islalobo> pantsofchocolate: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/37f1ad54631785df0cb5
[11:16:29] <tool> hello people! could you tell me please how can I check known security porblems of jquery?
[11:16:30] <frabbler_> billcriswell know why this doesnt work?
[11:16:31] <frabbler_> http://jsbin.com/guroki/2/edit
[11:16:41] <tool> and is jquery 1.8.1 is vulnerable?
[11:16:42] <robertmaxrees> tool not sure what you mean.
[11:17:07] <tool> robertmaxrees, I have an old website that uses jquery 1.8.1
[11:17:25] <tool> should I update jquery for that site?
[11:18:20] <robertmaxrees> you should run up-to-date anyway, but jquery in and of itself isn't necessarily going to trigger security problems.  sloppy backend work will, however
[11:19:29] <tool> robertmaxrees, is it hard to update 1.8.1 to last version? because I must hire a programmer for that
[11:20:08] <robertmaxrees> really depends on what you've god.
[11:20:22] <tool> I think that when you update you had better make a full website test, is it right? to check that everything works properly
[11:21:07] <robertmaxrees> yes.  i did that update not that long ago - there are some tools that help make it easy
[11:21:17] <robertmaxrees> http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/
[11:21:25] <robertmaxrees> the migrate plugin is helpful, too.
[11:21:27] <tool> thank you!

[11:22:12] <robertmaxrees> i did an upgrade from 1.8 to 1.11 a while back.  for security concerns, you really need to look at how users can interact with your site.
[11:22:35] <robertmaxrees> especially with regards to your backend.
[11:23:30] <tool> thank you!
[11:24:23] <frabbler_> bill criswell this is my json file
[11:24:24] <frabbler_> https://jsonblob.com/54cbd7aae4b03e047545c028
[11:24:24] <tool> see you:)
[11:24:41] <frabbler_> billcriswell
[11:26:54] <BillCriswell> frabbler_: Right right.
[11:27:50] <frabbler_> For some reason its not working when trying to use my json
[11:28:29] <BillCriswell> you'd want response.articles.slice
[11:29:26] <frabbler_> what is response
[11:29:53] <frabbler_> http://jsbin.com/guroki/5/edit
[11:32:24] <BillCriswell> frabbler_: It's what's in the function (THIS) {} on the cllback.
[11:33:57] <BillCriswell> frabbler_: That url you gave appears to output just html.
[11:35:20] <frabbler_> yeah
[11:35:25] <frabbler_> just noticed that
[11:35:35] <BillCriswell> but whenever you have a callback from an ajax request the first parameter of success is the response.
[11:35:44] <BillCriswell> So yours would be like response.articles
[11:38:08] <frabbler_> thanks bill
[11:38:22] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[11:38:26] <frabbler_> so just curious
[11:38:37] <frabbler_> this loads in 3 at a time
[11:38:39] <frabbler_> what if there is 10 items
[11:38:45] <frabbler_> will it just load the 1?
[12:20:16] <disappeared> does anyone know of a plugin that makes it easier to generates and modify forms…..the ones i see all change the style and functionality and i don’t need that
[12:21:13] <robertmaxrees> disappeared i can't think of anything offhand, but it should be pretty easy to build something like that.
[12:21:38] <disappeared> hah
[12:52:24] <wheeei> is el something that's part of jQuery?
[12:52:54] <robertmaxrees> wheeei have an example?
[12:54:37] <wheeei> robertmaxrees, function Confirmation(el) { this.el = el;   this.ticket = this.el.find('.ticket')}        from learn.jquery.com...
[12:55:03] <robertmaxrees> what page?
[12:58:46] <robertmaxrees> wheeei i ask because 'el' is an arbitrary thing - that's just a name.  i'm guessing Confirmation gets called elswhere and is passed some arguments.
[13:00:42] <Velveeta> yeah, in this case, el is just a parameter being passed in to the Confirmation constructor, so it could be literally anything
[13:00:58] <robertmaxrees> you could name it "butt" and it'd be the same thing.
[13:01:03] <Velveeta> in this case, it appears to represent a jquery object, since they're then dereferencing a find function
[13:01:14] <Robdgreat> In fact, I'd advocate that
[13:01:30] * Robdgreat makes it look like he highlights on "butt"
[13:01:33] <wheeei> one sec
[13:01:34] <Velveeta> right, it's right in that family of variables.. foo, bar, butt
[13:01:38] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:01:48] <robertmaxrees> foo, bar, butt, trumpet, cabbage.
[13:01:49] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[13:02:06] <Robdgreat> TIL "butt" is a metasyntactic variable
[13:02:41] <Velveeta> butt trumpet cabbage.. that sounds like a person i don't want to be around :D
[13:02:53] <robertmaxrees> reminds me of an ex from high school.
[13:03:15] <Robdgreat> oh God
[13:03:23] <Robdgreat> charming
[13:03:28] <wheeei> robertmaxrees, http://jsfiddle.net/kLLL6220/
[13:03:46] <robertmaxrees> wheeei yeah, that's just a naming convention.
[13:03:50] <robertmaxrees> you could call it anything.
[13:05:14] <Velveeta> your success and error callbacks are probably gonna have invalid scope
[13:05:23] <Velveeta> so they won't be able to see this.e
[13:05:26] <Velveeta> this.el even
[13:05:39] <Velveeta> same with beforeSend and complete
[13:05:59] <Velveeta> all of those references should be changed to just 'el'
[13:06:24] <Velveeta> or else you can pass the scope to those callbacks with something like .bind() or $.proxy()
[13:09:31] <wheeei> Velveeta, just gong through the learn.jquery.com course
[13:09:35] <wheeei> going*
[13:10:03] <Velveeta> that's fine, i was just pointing out things i saw in that fiddle example
[13:12:16] <Ghuigf> maybe some know how to run a torrent game of xbox360?
[13:12:24] <Ghuigf> I know this forum isn't for that
[13:12:26] <robertmaxrees> Ghuigf not a good palce for that.
[13:12:32] <robertmaxrees> piracy and all that ;)
[13:16:21] <Velveeta> w-t-f mate
[13:22:53] <t4nk719> hi, anyone experience with InstantClick?
[13:23:14] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ t4nk719
[13:23:15] <b-ot> t4nk719: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:24:59] <t4nk719> I am sorry, I was wondering if it was possible to "blacklist" a certain part of javascript from loading in background after a link is being loaded in background using InstantClick
[13:25:22] <t4nk719> Because that javascript part is a var = Setting, and it overwrites the one currently used on the page
[13:27:18] <t4nk719> does anyone have an idea perhaps?
[13:27:31] <robertmaxrees> do you have a link to the docs for InstantClick?
[13:27:43] <robertmaxrees> generally, the answer would be "no", depending on how it's doing what it's doing.
[13:29:21] <t4nk719> So it wouldn't be possible that way
[13:29:43] <t4nk719> http://instantclick.io is the website
[13:30:04] <t4nk719> but I cannot find a proper way to exclude a lil bit of javascript to filter out this defined variable
[13:30:11] <k1t> Is there a more elegant way of doing this: $(e.currentTarget).addClass('active').siblings().removeClass('active')
[13:30:25] <k1t> ?:)
[13:31:36] <robertmaxrees> k1t are there any other 'active' elements on the page?
[13:31:45] <k1t> hmmm maybe toggleClass
[13:32:17] <k1t> no, just one at a time in this context
[13:32:18] <robertmaxrees> k1t because you could just $('.active').removeClass('active'); $(e.currentTarget).addClass('active');
[13:32:34] <k1t> yeah that would definitely work
[13:32:40] <k1t> i think i prefer the chaining syntax though
[13:33:01] <robertmaxrees> you're incurring some extra overhead by doing the dom traversal.
[13:33:10] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't matter much, but maybe something to consider.
[13:33:32] <k1t> droppin pro tips her
[13:33:32] <k1t> e
[13:33:35] <k1t> :)
[13:33:42] <k1t> ty robertmaxrees
[13:33:51] <robertmaxrees> t4nk719 yeah, no real way
[13:34:40] <t4nk719> well that's a shame, as I use the var Setting = "progress1" to determine what form has been sent
[13:34:53] <robertmaxrees> change it to something else maybe?
[13:35:00] <robertmaxrees> or scope things to IIFEs?
[13:36:23] <t4nk719> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/46fvkz1t/ is what I use
[13:36:42] <t4nk719> it gets the defined variable formIdentity
[13:36:59] <t4nk719> but because the next page is being preload it gets the new variable instead already
[13:37:08] <t4nk719> since it's overwritten :/
[13:37:41] <t4nk719> any idea how I can use this part with InstantClick? So I can still identify the forms
[13:39:44] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you need to identify that some other way.
[13:39:48] <robertmaxrees> instead of having that as a global.
[13:41:06] <robertmaxrees> great example why globals are bad :)
[13:41:49] <t4nk719> indeed :< any idea of a more elegant way to do this, perhaps?
[13:42:18] <t4nk719> with jQuery, as far as that is possible
[13:47:48] <robertmaxrees> not without some very gross hacks.
[13:48:07] <robertmaxrees> and that's not a jquery thing really.
[14:11:09] <EredarLord> Hey guys, I'm looking for ways to make this code (http://jsfiddle.net/kmyqzdea/) better/tidy, can anyone recommend any design pattern specifically for situations like this?
[14:12:40] <robertmaxrees> easy :)
[14:13:18] <EredarLord> would appreciate any kind of input
[14:13:38] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kmyqzdea/2/
[14:13:41] <robertmaxrees> start with this.
[14:14:15] <robertmaxrees> you had the exact same logic in two places - define it once and bind a single listener using .on() for both the relevant events.
[14:14:23] <robertmaxrees> though you might not evenr need the keyup portion fwiw
[14:17:18] <EredarLord> robertmaxrees: thanks, i know i have the same logic but can't seem to be able to efficiently merge it together and differentiate it
[14:17:52] <robertmaxrees> ah add and remove class.
[14:18:06] <EredarLord> i need the actual event to fire on keyup because otherwise it fires every millisecond if you keep the button pressed
[14:18:09] <robertmaxrees> missed that part.
[14:18:32] <EredarLord> yeah, supposedly when you keydown you get the feedback, then keyup == event happens, active class gets removed
[14:18:43] <robertmaxrees> yeah i klnow what you're doing now.
[14:18:44] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[14:19:34] <robertmaxrees> also keep in mind that the event fires regardless.
[14:20:07] <robertmaxrees> there are a few cute ways to approach this, but I will say that the easiest is also the most obvious.
[14:21:20] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kmyqzdea/3/
[14:21:23] <MikeD_> .on('keypress','input[type=number]',function(evt){ if( !reAllowedCharacters.test( String.fromCharCode( evt.which ) ) { evt.preventDefault(); } );  I'm noticing a long delay before a valid character appears after I try typing an invalid character... any idea why?
[14:21:54] <robertmaxrees> the .test() might be your problem?
[14:21:58] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it though.
[14:22:03] <robertmaxrees> and seeit in action.
[14:22:56] <EredarLord> robertmaxrees: thanks so much, the original problem I had is that I need the actual event to fire on keyUp along with removeClass, because otherwise if I bind a functoin on keydown the functoin will run forever as long as a user has his button pressed, not sure if I'm making any sense
[14:23:22] <ronswan> EredarLord: use a debounce
[14:23:23] <robertmaxrees> EredarLord right, because "keydown" happens however often the OS fires it.
[14:23:39] <EredarLord> yes, that's what I was trying to avoid
[14:23:39] <ronswan> good plugins for jquery out there to do it
[14:23:47] <robertmaxrees> you can't avoid using a debounce in this case.
[14:24:22] <EredarLord> oh I see.. it's either debounce or duplicate code
[14:24:26] <EredarLord> thanks guys!
[14:24:29] <robertmaxrees> you don't need the dupe code...
[14:24:32] <robertmaxrees> look at my example.
[14:24:36] <robertmaxrees> the last one.
[14:24:44] <EredarLord> yes, the last one with debounce right
[14:24:51] <robertmaxrees> huh? no.
[14:24:59] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kmyqzdea/3/
[14:25:09] <robertmaxrees> with the .removeClass()
[14:25:20] <EredarLord> let me edit this to show what I mean
[14:25:39] <robertmaxrees> err.
[14:25:44] <robertmaxrees> this does exactly what you want lol
[14:27:45] <EredarLord> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/kmyqzdea/4/
[14:28:06] <robertmaxrees> that's now how that works
[14:28:10] <robertmaxrees> *not
[14:28:18] <EredarLord> ?
[14:29:30] <robertmaxrees> it only keeps running as long as the key is held down.
[14:29:44] <robertmaxrees> placing it in the keyup event doesn't stop that part.
[14:31:13] <EredarLord> uhm.. i'm not making myself clear I believe
[14:31:15] <robertmaxrees> all the keyup does is run code when you do the keyup.
[14:31:23] <EredarLord> yes
[14:31:48] <robertmaxrees> in the specific example given, I have removed the .active class from all letters that have it, which is basically what you want.
[14:31:52] <EredarLord> i want to run the main code on the keyup event, not on the keydown event
[14:32:04] <robertmaxrees> do you have a more specific example you're working with?
[14:32:28] <EredarLord> sec, i'll edit the original
[14:34:02] <MikeD_> rewrote without regex, good enough for today
[14:34:13] <fartface> How come sometimes a jQuery DOM element shows up like <html>...</html>, with all of the child nodes, (for example), and other times shows up as 'html' with a whole pile of other attributes that are inherited (I would think)?
[14:34:19] <fartface> Hopefully that question makes sense...
[14:34:47] <robertmaxrees> have an example?
[14:35:28] <fartface> Yeah, I'm in Chrome Developer tools, let me take a couple of screenshots as I'm not sure where the cutoff is (like when it changes to the other type)
[14:35:45] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you're looking at raw dom nodes vs jquery object.
[14:35:48] <robertmaxrees> *objects
[14:35:55] <EredarLord> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/kmyqzdea/7/
[14:36:29] <EredarLord> so, i want to run a complex function when a key is pressed. I want to run it on keyup because otherwise (if i run it on keydown) the user might keep the button pressed, so the function will run multiple times
[14:36:33] <robertmaxrees> i really don't like these "just imagine" cases...
[14:36:47] <robertmaxrees> and what you're doing still doesn't make sense.
[14:37:01] <EredarLord> why? :(
[14:37:01] <robertmaxrees> keydown fires - and can fire a lot of times, and then stops firing as soon as the key is released.
[14:37:22] <robertmaxrees> because that's how events work?
[14:37:25] <EredarLord> yes, and when the key is released, the keyup fires, and then I want to run my code
[14:37:29] <robertmaxrees> can you describe the actual scenario you're in?
[14:37:46] <EredarLord> sure
[14:38:17] <EredarLord> a user is presented with a random image, if it's a boy he clicks "yes", if it's a girl he clicks "no", and he can also skip (3) if he's unsure
[14:38:24] <krambiorix> hi, what am  i doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/6xtco6y6/2/
[14:38:28] <EredarLord> when he clicks either of those 3 buttons, a new image gets loaded
[14:39:01] <EredarLord> so when someone clicks a button i send that informatino (yes no or maybe) to the back end which register if that image was a boy girl or it was skipped
[14:39:06] <robertmaxrees> ah
[14:39:07] <robertmaxrees> i get it.
[14:39:10] <EredarLord> and then load a new image
[14:39:18] <robertmaxrees> you want to avoid the scenario where they're just holding down the button
[14:39:25] <fartface> robertmaxress: here's how I am used to it looking: http://i.imgur.com/eiWD3HE.jpg
[14:39:38] <EredarLord> so if I put that code in the keydown event, a user could simply keep the yes button pressed accidentally and go through 10 images in a fraction of a second
[14:39:42] <EredarLord> yes....
[14:39:46] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:40:03] <fartface> robermaxrees: and here's what's coming up in my other window http://i.imgur.com/8dNqe02.jpg
[14:40:04] <robertmaxrees> you have two options - put all your code in the keyup event only instead.
[14:40:23] <robertmaxrees> fartface can you make a fiddle?  something isn't adding up here.
[14:40:44] <robertmaxrees> EredarLord or set a status variable in down and up and change state accordingly.
[14:41:06] <EredarLord> is there a link with an example/more info on that second idea?
[14:41:20] <robertmaxrees> nope, but I can make one for you.
[14:42:39] <fartface> robertmaxrees: It's definitely raw DOM vs jQuery object.  Somewhere along the way I must've done something, I'll chase down that lead, you look pretty busy with other questions at the moment haha!
[14:42:41] <fartface> Thanks!
[14:42:51] <robertmaxrees> nah it's all good - glad i could help :)
[14:43:41] <EredarLord> robertmaxrees: would appreciate it very much and thanks for your time btw
[14:44:00] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wfLgwrjz/
[14:44:03] <robertmaxrees> this should illustrate.
[14:45:10] <EredarLord> thank you very much!
[14:45:21] <robertmaxrees> does that make sense?
[14:45:26] <krambiorix> my dropzonejs doesn't accept the file. Anyone any idea? http://jsfiddle.net/6xtco6y6/3/
[14:46:44] <robertmaxrees> "doesn't accept the file" meaning....
[14:47:02] <LindsayMac> I'm putting together a form that submits content via $.ajax .. my form has a LOT of fields and I am wondering if there is a way to get all the form inputs name/value in a JSON string so I don't have to get them each one by one
[14:47:22] <EredarLord> yes, I'm studying it still
[14:47:55] <robertmaxrees> LindsayMac http://api.jquery.com/serialize/ and http://api.jquery.com/serializearray/
[14:48:04] <frabblerock> this may be a dumb question
[14:48:20] <frabblerock> but can i make two separate ajax request with one button click
[14:48:34] <robertmaxrees> should be able to.
[14:49:15] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, "doesn't accept the file" meaning it doesn't upload the file and enters the accept function
[14:55:33] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix even http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6xtco6y6/4/ doesn't work.
[14:55:42] <robertmaxrees> wait now it does.
[14:55:55] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[14:56:37] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, but the accept is never entered
[14:56:52] <robertmaxrees> it does if you click and manually select.
[14:56:53] <robertmaxrees> not on drop
[14:57:46] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, right
[14:58:01] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  thanks!
[14:58:06] <robertmaxrees> aaaah reread your question - derp krambiorix hahaha
[14:58:19] <LindsayMac> I am actually now thinking I am not going ot be able to do that anyways because I have a file upload field
[14:58:47] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, ?
[14:59:03] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix i confused the issue.  one sec.
[15:00:28] <robertmaxrees> the docs make it pretty clear that you can break things by overwriting default actions and uses drop as an example.
[15:00:56] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you'd need to wire things up yourself if you wnat to use your own drop.
[15:02:21] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, wth
[15:02:40] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do with the drop?
[15:03:48] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, i need the accept
[15:03:59] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, don't need the drop... The drop is just for testing
[15:04:02] <robertmaxrees> then remove the drop:
[15:06:14] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, that helps yes
[15:06:26] <krambiorix> but it oesn't send my file
[15:06:34] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6xtco6y6/5/
[15:06:50] <robertmaxrees> make sure your config is good.
[15:08:20] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, your fiddle doesn't work
[15:08:34] <robertmaxrees> i know - ity gets to the accept.
[15:08:44] <robertmaxrees> that's all.
[15:08:48] <robertmaxrees> doesn't call the .done()
[15:11:42] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, apparently not a valid file
[15:12:57] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, found it!
[15:13:05] <robertmaxrees> nice!  what was it?
[15:13:23] <krambiorix> the parameter :  acceptedFiles: 'images/*'
[15:13:30] <krambiorix> is not correct
[15:13:35] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah... that was one of the things i removed ;)
[15:13:39] <robertmaxrees> but awesome.
[15:13:49] <robertmaxrees> why'd you add it in originally?
[15:14:10] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, only accepting images ...
[15:14:20] <robertmaxrees> oh hah
[15:16:30] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, had to be "image/*" without the s
[15:16:31] <krambiorix> pfff
[15:16:43] <krambiorix> fridayevening programming, nothing can beat it
[15:17:42] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, thanks for the help!
[15:17:50] <robertmaxrees> deffo - well done :)
[15:20:46] <wiggl3> Hey
[15:21:29] <robertmaxrees> yo\
[15:22:16] <wiggl3> I have a question for you
[15:22:27] <robertmaxrees> shiit
[15:22:28] <robertmaxrees> *shoot
[15:23:55] <wiggl3> lol
[15:24:08] <wiggl3> At this JS/CSS slideshow: http://jsfiddle.net/wiggl3/j2xqumpj/, how to make the slides centered within their parent regardless of its width?
[15:24:19] <wiggl3> * the width
[15:26:14] <robertmaxrees> you have some CSS to fix up, but http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/j2xqumpj/1/
[15:33:12] <wiggl3> robertmaxrees: still looks messed up here =/
[15:33:17] <wiggl3> i should provide a better error description maybe
[15:33:28] <wiggl3> thanks though
[15:33:46] * wiggl3 passes robertmaxrees a beer and a joint
[15:49:56] <wiggl3> robertmaxrees: ok i got a better description now if you're still there
[15:50:22] <wiggl3> This JS/CSS slideshow works fine if the width of the container is the same as the width of the images (ie. 400px): http://jsfiddle.net/wiggl3/j2xqumpj/show
[15:50:25] <wiggl3> But how to center the images horizontally while hiding the inactive slides if the container is larger or smaller than the images? (ie. 800px or 200px)
[15:50:32] <wiggl3> i reckon it's more of a css thing though like you pointed out
[15:53:22] <david89> Hello. I have a Date object. I am trying to set such Date object as the value for an input with type date. I am using $('#date_input').val(myDateObj) but it is settings some sort of verbose date
[15:54:31] <robertmaxrees> wiggl3 i'd check out any of the dozens of carousel plugins that show you how to do this.
[15:54:51] <wiggl3> was hoping i could do this without having to include one of those
[15:55:02] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying to learn the basic idea.
[15:55:09] <wiggl3> ah yeah
[15:55:13] <robertmaxrees> basically there's a parent element that's whatever width you wand to display that's set to overflow: hidden; then a child element that's got everything in it whose margin-left you decrease.
[15:55:14] <wiggl3> i guess i could
[15:55:25] <wiggl3> cool
[15:57:32] <prazic> i'm trying to implement ReadingTime.js jquery plugin, but I must be missing something because I'm not getting an output: http://pastebin.com/BkqxV0E7
[15:58:04] <wiggl3> prazic: Could you try setting up a live test case? Please see: http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[15:58:45] <prazic> wiggl3, hmm i've been doing this as local development, might be a bit tricky
[15:58:52] <kevireilly> wiggl3: a CSS background-image based approach might work for you with background-position and wha tnot
[16:00:17] <wiggl3> kevireilly: ill look into it, thanks
[16:06:15] <prazic> anyone or wiggl3 : http://jsfiddle.net/6ae1g3x6/
[16:06:39] <TeddyMurray> in jquery mobile im trying to submit a form with a file in it but it isn't posting the $_FILES
[16:08:50] <garethdaine> Guys, this isn’t jquery specific but JS (specifically Google Maps v3). Is there a way to get the current maps marker lat/lng?
[16:12:32] <Mark_2> can anyone help me figure out why this colorpicker plugin isnt working? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/request# it’s in the panel on the left side.
[16:25:34] <andrew9183> garethdaine: of course, read the docs
[16:25:38] <robertmaxrees> Mark_2 you loading everything in the right order?
[16:25:45] <robertmaxrees> jquery, the plugin, then your code?
[16:25:50] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:25:56] <Mark_2> i think so..
[16:26:11] <garethdaine> I’ve sorted it andrew9183
[16:26:14] <Mark_2> http://automattic.github.io/Iris/# done everything in the right order i think.
[16:26:14] <andrew9183> no you’re not Mark_2
[16:26:22] <andrew9183> you’re loading it in the wrong order
[16:26:42] <Mark_2> oh am i ?
[16:27:33] <andrew9183> TeddyMurray: how are you checking ? $_FILES sounds like a PHP thing
[16:27:50] <TeddyMurray> i figured it out, needed to use FormData in ajax instead of post
[16:32:09] <robertmaxrees> Mark_2 also, don't conditionally load versions of jquery.
[16:32:12] <robertmaxrees> use one or the other.
[16:33:00] <Mark_2> k, it’s only builted in with the CMS im using, im not the one who’s doing it.
[16:33:10] <robertmaxrees> that's really strange.
[16:33:12] <Mark_2> but how do i fix the color-picker?
[16:33:22] <robertmaxrees> load jquery, then jquery ui, then the slider code, then your code.
[17:01:34] <krambiorix> robertWorkBeer, still there?
[17:01:38] <robertWorkBeer> yep
[17:05:13] <krambiorix> robertWorkBeer, i have a ui design question.    I have a page with on top an input field and below that the dropzone.. The input field is the name of the picture gallery. I want to show a save button on top of the page. So when the user changes the input field , they can change it...
[17:05:35] <krambiorix> Now, people will think they'll have to save everytime they uploaded a picture
[17:05:39] <krambiorix> any idea about this?
[17:06:12] <robertWorkBeer> can you show me the current design?>
[17:06:15] <robertWorkBeer> hard to visualise.
[17:07:19] <krambiorix> robertWorkBeer, ok give me a sec
[17:07:25] <robertWorkBeer> even just a screenshot
[17:13:18] <krambiorix> robertWorkBeer, http://imagebin.ca/v/1pzCqBi2xUXe
[17:15:03] <robertWorkBeer> I'd stick a save button at the top and bottom, and maybe clarify that you can add/remove/change at will.
[17:15:45] <krambiorix> robertWorkBeer, but still users will think they have to save when they have uploaded pictures
[17:16:08] <robertWorkBeer> i'd also set it to provide a warning when they go to leave the page.
[17:16:36] <robertWorkBeer> you could also provide info in your documentation to say that they don't have to save every time.
[17:16:58] <krambiorix> robertWorkBeer, yes
[17:17:09] <krambiorix> robertWorkBeer, you're right
[17:18:09] <krambiorix> robertWorkBeer, when they leave the page, showing an error IF they have changed something. But what if they have uploaded pictures?
[17:19:41] <robertWorkBeer> does that require that they hit "save"?
[17:19:49] <krambiorix> nope
[17:20:14] <robertWorkBeer> then don't warn them.  disable the button and only enable it when they do something that requires it.
[17:20:23] <robertWorkBeer> visually grey it out when it's disabled, too.
[17:21:03] <krambiorix> yeah
[17:21:29] <krambiorix> robertWorkBeer, ok great thanks again!
[17:21:34] <robertWorkBeer> fsho!
[17:24:15] <psyon> I'm trying to build a PhoneGap app for Windows, but when I use data-add-back-btn, JQM triggers a security error about dynamic content.  I've done some digging on google, and all the solutions revolve around my code, and not code in JQM.  Is anyone familiar with the issue enough to point me in the right direction for a fix?
[17:24:44] <robertWorkBeer> have an example?
[17:24:57] <psyon> an example app? or a paste of the error?
[17:25:08] <robertWorkBeer> a paste of how you're generating the error.
[17:25:31] <psyon> If I use data-add-back-btn in my app, when JQM trys to add the back button it triggers it.
[17:25:39] <psyon> Otherwise, you trigger it by using obj.innerHTML
[17:26:05] <psyon> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18454810/windows-8-phonegap-application-jquery-mobile-security-exception
[17:26:23] <psyon> There is a lot of discussion about it, I just can't see how to fix it when JQM is doing the content injection
[17:27:54] <robertWorkBeer> i'm not seeing any documentation for data-add-back-button
[17:28:20] <robertWorkBeer> hrm.
[17:28:32] <psyon> Hold on, ill find the docs.
[17:29:09] <psyon> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/toolbar/
[17:29:12] <psyon> it's mentioned there
[17:29:16] <psyon> but I lost the other page for it
[17:29:26] <psyon> "The framework automatically generates a "back" button on a header when the page plugin's addBackBtn option is true. This can also be set via markup if the header has a data-add-back-btn="true" attribute."
[17:30:57] <robertWorkBeer> looking at the source now.
[17:31:10] <robertWorkBeer> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/3efe6fedad0f5f259d8616f0c753a22fe5595fb6/js/widgets/toolbar.js#L147-L157
[17:31:12] <robertWorkBeer> this is why.
[17:32:05] <psyon> I saw some docs saying that jQuery 2.0 had been fixed, and taken the security checks into account, but JQM hasn't been apparently?
[17:32:19] <robertWorkBeer> not in the way you need.
[17:32:35] <psyon> DOh!
[17:32:35] <robertWorkBeer> it has to do with a place where an edge case meets an edge case.
[17:32:36] <psyon> hehe
[17:33:14] <robertWorkBeer> I might put in a ticket on the git repo if I were you.
[17:33:43] <psyon> Will do.
[17:34:43] <psyon> Just to make sure I'm not missing something in jquery code, this fix appears to have been for jquery 1.x, and not 2.x
[17:34:45] <psyon> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10859523/using-jquery-with-windows-8-metro-javascript-app-causes-security-error
[17:34:49] <psyon> does that seem right?
[17:34:58] <robertWorkBeer> you're confused about what's causing the error.,
[17:35:13] <psyon> I am?
[17:35:27] <robertWorkBeer> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/3efe6fedad0f5f259d8616f0c753a22fe5595fb6/js/widgets/toolbar.js#L147-L157
[17:35:44] <robertWorkBeer> adding a back button triggers this code.
[17:36:05] <psyon> yeah, and it's the dynamic generation of HTML that triggers the error
[17:36:06] <robertWorkBeer> see where it's building up a string to generate markup?
[17:36:08] <robertWorkBeer> exactly.
[17:36:33] <robertWorkBeer> this is in the latest version of JQM.  i'm being lazy, but i'm not seeing where it says to NOT do this other than if you already have a backbUTTON
[17:37:23] <psyon> You know, I couldn't find any instance of "add-back-btn" in the code, but if I don't have data-add-back-btn="true" it doesn't add a back button
[17:37:31] <robertWorkBeer> right.
[17:37:38] <robertWorkBeer> internally, it's addbackbtn
[17:37:49] <robertWorkBeer> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=addbackbtn
[17:38:03] <robertWorkBeer> data attributes with dashes are camelCased.
[17:38:10] <psyon> But either way, the issue is that it's creating it from an HTML string, and not creating elements in the DOM
[17:38:13] <robertWorkBeer> so data-add-back-btn becomes addBackBtn
[17:38:14] <psyon> Ah, ok.
[17:38:21] <robertWorkBeer> err.
[17:38:40] <robertWorkBeer> it's trying to create elements in the DOM from a string.
[17:39:41] <psyon>  i mean, it's not using createElement()
[17:39:56] <robertWorkBeer> or any of the other ways to create elements in jquery ;)
[17:40:11] <robertWorkBeer> what version of jquery are you using in your application?
[17:40:16] <psyon> 2.1.3
[17:40:44] <robertWorkBeer> then yeah.
[17:40:48] <psyon> I updated to that yesterday because I read that it fixed the issue
[17:40:58] <robertWorkBeer> yeah, it's nbot the problem afai
[17:41:02] <robertWorkBeer> *afaik
[17:44:41] <psyon> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/85ffc6d973865a031ded170934e0acfc2e97cb11/src/manipulation.js#L338
[17:44:51] <psyon> That is the line that the VS debugger says is triggering the error now
[17:45:02] <psyon> but it only does it when I use the add-back-btn data attribute
[17:45:13] <robertWorkBeer> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/3efe6fedad0f5f259d8616f0c753a22fe5595fb6/js/widgets/toolbar.js#L147-L157 reread this ;)
[17:45:15] <robertWorkBeer> step through the code.
[17:45:17] <psyon> Before I updated to 2.1.3, the app wouldn't even start
[17:45:53] <psyon> So... manually create a back button?
[17:46:13] <robertWorkBeer> in the meantime.
[17:46:18] <robertWorkBeer> have you submitted the bug report?
[17:46:22] <psyon> Not yet
[17:46:26] <psyon> was trying to narrow it down further
[17:46:30] <psyon> to make sure I was over looking something
[17:46:47] <robertWorkBeer> if you're in the jquery library, that's where the bug goes :)
[17:49:20] <psyon> I'm not sure that's where it goes though... because I'm not sure how far back the WinJS stuff checks where the element came from
[17:49:25] <robertWorkBeer> jqueyr mobile.
[17:49:36] <psyon> I'm removing the data-add-back-btn tempoararily
[17:49:40] <robertWorkBeer> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues
[17:49:41] <psyon> to test if other things trigger the error
[17:55:35] <wiggl3> Hello everyone
[17:55:46] <prazic> hi wiggl3
[17:55:47] <wiggl3> I'm trying to do some basic text truncation: http://jsfiddle.net/wiggl3/ecghy2tg/11/
[17:55:50] <wiggl3> But how do I prevent `filter` - which I use to count the words (ie. only truncate paragraphs with more than 50 words) - from truncating my first paragraph three times (ie. once for every paragraph in the container)?
[17:55:54] <wiggl3> prazic :)
[17:56:31] <wiggl3> prazic: What you up to?
[17:56:47] <prazic> wiggl3, still trying to get this estimated thing to work.. it isn't displaying minutes :(
[17:57:27] <wiggl3> Bug fixin' on a friday night huh :)
[17:57:59] <wiggl3> While everyone else is out getting laid =/
[17:58:40] <psyon> Nope, I'm here :P
[17:59:19] <robertWorkBeer> wiggl3 i'm at work sooo ;)
[17:59:25] <robertWorkBeer> so what are you trying to do here?
[17:59:48] <robertWorkBeer> truncate every line to 50 chars?
[17:59:55] <wiggl3> :D
[17:59:55] <robertWorkBeer> *50 words, rather.
[18:00:32] <prazic> wiggl3, ill be getting that kind of action tonight but currently its saturday arvo
[18:00:44] <prazic> ;)
[18:00:48] <wiggl3> nope basically to run some truncation functions if the paragraph has more than 50 words. that part works though. that's odd is that the truncation gets executed 3 times, once for every paragraph, whereas it should only get executed once
[18:01:16] <wiggl3> prazic: thats great man ;)
[18:01:18] <robertWorkBeer> it's because you're doing everything againts "firstParagraph"
[18:01:20] <robertWorkBeer> *against
[18:01:23] <wiggl3> prazic: wait, saturday? where you at?
[18:01:38] <wiggl3> robertWorkBeer: hmm
[18:01:48] <prazic> wiggl3, i'm in australia. where you at?
[18:02:11] <robertWorkBeer> .filter() isn't generally used the way you're using it.
[18:02:13] <robertWorkBeer> you want .each()
[18:02:24] <psyon> This is all sorts of wonky.  In one spoot $('#target').html(content); works fine, and in another, it triggers this security error
[18:02:34] <robertWorkBeer> lol
[18:04:01] <wiggl3> prazic: wow, awesome. im currently at amsterdam airport on my way to tahiti
[18:04:20] <wiggl3> chilling at the lounge with my jquery buddies :P
[18:04:25] <wiggl3> robertWorkBeer: one sec please
[18:04:32] <prazic> wiggl3, going for a quick holiday?
[18:05:25] <wiggl3> prazic: i am i am
[18:05:41] <prazic> lucky duck. jquery conference over there too?
[18:05:43] <prazic> ;-)
[18:05:43] <wiggl3> trying to avoid tourist season
[18:06:33] <wiggl3> nah by jquery buddies i meant you lot
[18:07:10] <wiggl3> im the only guy at the airport lounge but enough about that
[18:08:24] <wiggl3> prazic: i reckon you guys dont ever need to travel abroad you got everything you need right there :D
[18:09:44] <prazic> except the legal things you have over there ;_
[18:09:46] <wiggl3> white sandy beaches with palm trees, exotic deserts
[18:09:48] <prazic> "legal"
[18:09:55] <wiggl3> hehe
[18:11:15] <wiggl3> robertWorkBeer: will cut out filter, thanks.. (got it from http://stackoverflow.com/a/5120784)
[18:12:01] <robertWorkBeer> use .each() instead.
[18:12:08] <wiggl3> yup
[18:12:12] <robertWorkBeer> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ecghy2tg/12/
[18:14:14] <wiggl3> cheers !
[18:15:50] <wiggl3> robertWorkBeer: actually might as well cut out that each() altogether, not sure what it's doing there
[18:16:14] <robertWorkBeer> pretty obvious...
[18:16:41] <robertWorkBeer> you only want the ones with 50 or more, right?
[18:19:11] <wiggl3> kinda hard to explain.. end goal is this: truncate first paragraph if it has more than 50 words, hide all other paragraphs
[18:19:20] <wiggl3> if first paragraph has say 25 words, leave it, go to the next paragraph and truncate only 25 words (totalling 50), hide all other paragraphs
[18:19:48] <wiggl3> but i'll leave that task to my children when they grow up
[18:19:58] <prazic> wiggl3, fixed my issue. goodluck with your project and the holiday - talk soon!!
[18:20:20] <wiggl3> prazic: oh yeah for real man, good to hear and it was nice meeting you
[18:20:30] <robertWorkBeer> that'd be relatively easy to do ,but OK :)
[18:20:44] <hrusti> http://jsfiddle.net/ayL3vqku/9/
[18:20:58] <hrusti> how to get this work as expected?
[18:20:58] <wiggl3> robertWorkBeer :D
[18:25:23] <psyon> ok, so the back button thing triggers the error because of the javascript:void(0); in the html, and the part in my app triggerring it otherwise, is because apparently the "for" attribute in labels is considereed insecure
[18:25:38] <robertWorkBeer> it's not insecure...
[18:25:45] <robertWorkBeer> at least, not inherently.
[18:25:52] <psyon> Right.
[18:26:05] <psyon> I could see some odd cases, where you dynically inject a lable with a for pointing to some checkbox or something
[18:26:08] <psyon> or some other form field
[18:26:22] <robertWorkBeer> shouldn't matter much.
[18:26:25] <psyon> but I'm not sure I agree that its a big security issue that its not allowed
[18:26:34] <psyon> https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465388.aspx
[18:26:41] <psyon> What ever their reasons, MS says it's insecure
[18:27:02] <systemfault> MS also said that WebGL is insecure
[18:27:17] <robertWorkBeer> right.
[18:27:29] <robertWorkBeer> psyon you really need to submit a bug to jquery mobile.
[18:27:56] <psyon> I am going to
[18:28:11] <psyon> Was just about ot ask for a good suggestion to replace "href='javascript:void(0);'" so when I submit the bug, I can give an option
[18:29:10] <robertWorkBeer> where are you seeing the void use?
[18:29:22] <psyon> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/3efe6fedad0f5f259d8616f0c753a22fe5595fb6/js/widgets/toolbar.js#L147-L157
[18:29:26] <psyon> in the code you linked me to earlier
[18:29:58] <robertWorkBeer> yeah, let them figure that part out imo.  it should be an event handler that cancels
[18:30:13] <psyon> ok
[18:30:27] <robertWorkBeer> but there might be a really good reason for the void use.
[18:30:39] <psyon> but.... I need a fix to put in place for my app :P  I'll just change it ti href='#' and see if that causes any issues fo rme
[18:30:49] <robertWorkBeer> lol
[18:30:55] <robertWorkBeer> that's not going to work right btw.
[18:31:00] <psyon> I figured
[18:31:03] <psyon> since it uses hashes for navigation
[18:31:22] <psyon> can you just omit the href?
[18:31:34] <robertWorkBeer> you could try, might not style/work right.
[18:31:50] <robertWorkBeer> honestly, I'd hand roll a replacement instead.
[18:32:51] <psyon> The path to some of these pages isn't always fixed though, so a back button isn't always needed.  It's nice that JQM works out if there is a history or not
[18:32:55] <psyon> but I may just have to
[18:34:24] <robertWorkBeer> i gotta bounce.  enjoy.
[18:36:10] <psyon> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7949
[18:36:12] <psyon> does that make sense?
[18:36:15] <psyon> I suck at describing things sometimes
[18:38:32] <psyon> DOh!  I keep submitting things as the wrong user account
[19:39:01] <jeffreylevesque> is angular generally preferred over ember, and backbone?
[19:39:36] <jeffreylevesque> i was just skimming over https://www.airpair.com/js/javascript-framework-comparison
[19:39:43] <jeffreylevesque> and it seems angularjs is nice
[19:52:37] <systemfault> Angular is just the most popular...
[19:53:12] <systemfault> And since the angular devs told its entire community a big "Fuck you all" by making Angular 2.0 a totally different thing without any migration path... I'm not sure it's going to stay relevant for a long time.
[19:53:22] <systemfault> We'll see, I might be wrong.
[20:58:49] <robertmaxrees> HEAVY METAL TIME.  666 PEOPLE.
[21:15:35] <Mark_2> is it SlideDown and SlideUp?
[21:16:03] <robertmaxrees> !api slideDown
[21:16:04] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .slideDown(): Display the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
[21:21:26] <Mark_2> um,
[21:21:32] <Mark_2> for some reason this doesn’t work. $('.main_menu').find('li').mouseenter(function(){
[21:21:33] <Mark_2> 		$(this).find('>ul').slideDown('fast');
[21:21:37] <Mark_2> am i doing it in a wrong way?
[21:21:52] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see the markup.
[21:21:58] <robertmaxrees> also, ULs can be funky with slides.
[21:22:10] <Mark_2> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/request
[21:22:22] <Mark_2> the community menu has the function.
[21:23:51] <robertmaxrees> fix the JS errors first.
[21:24:02] <robertmaxrees> that can cause other code to bomb.
[22:53:19] <gtristan> Hi, I'm wondering if it's possible, and how, to do the type of animation I want to do
[22:53:45] <gtristan> What I have is a sort of dialog with multiple pages, which I control the visible one using a 'pagination' below
[22:53:52] <gtristan> http://getbootstrap.com/components/#pagination <-- one of these bootstrap things
[22:54:09] <gtristan> with a << left and a >> right and some descriptive buttons for the pages
[22:54:53] <gtristan> What I want to do, instead of a braindead $(element).show() and $(element).hide()... is to have the pages 'slide' left and right seamlessly
[22:55:24] <gtristan> I see that jquery has some stock slide Up and Down effects, but I want left and right
[22:55:45] <gtristan> and actually (I know, I'm so demanding)... I want to make sure that I can 'clip' the invisible regions
[22:56:12] <gtristan> I.e., it's not really good to animate the 'width' directly
[22:56:54] <gtristan> that would cause reflow and recalculation of all the internal nodes of both pages (internal sizes would have to be recalculated), and the effect would be rather ugly I suppose
[22:58:15] <gtristan> Actually I suppose it's quite possible, its essentially what 'carousel' does
[22:58:23] <gtristan> (the bootstrap thingy)
[22:58:42] <gtristan> hmm, I'll go look at what jquery bootstrap does for a carousel
[23:12:02] <gtristan> eek, carousel uses setInterval to do the transition ? :-S
[23:15:07] <gtristan> oh no it doesnt, it uses that for the timeout between transitions
[23:18:05] <gtristan> aha, CSS3 transitions, not supported on < IE10
[23:18:14] <gtristan> eh
[23:18:35] <gtristan> also without support for any nesting, yuck
[23:18:39] <hives> who can help a jquery noob?
[23:19:36] <hives> I need to give my list a class when its expanded here is my jquery http://pastie.org/9875651
[23:19:43] <hives> any help I would appreciate
[23:27:45] <gtristan> hives, http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/ takes a Function to call when it's done
[23:28:09] <gtristan> just give it a function and then .addClass ()
[23:28:15] <gtristan> in that 'complete' function
[23:28:40] <hives> man im a jquery noob, im bassicly trying to edit someone elses jqyery
[23:28:50] <hives> so i can add a class when its expanded to the link
[23:29:37] <gtristan> sure, you can do whatever you want once the animation is complete, that's what the callback argument is for :)
[23:42:24] <Diabhs> This is telling me it is missing a formal parameter? http://hastebin.com/juruvizaxi.pas
