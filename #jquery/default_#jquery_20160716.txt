[01:17:31] <aiena> How do I properly upload files with jquery ajax this does not work http://paste.ubuntu.com/19594782/
[03:14:52] <aro> can someone help me with this pen?
[03:14:53] <aro> http://codepen.io/barrychapman/pen/BzJGbg?editors=1011
[03:15:03] <aro> click on 'add to metric 2' and then click on 'resort'
[03:15:22] <aro> i dont understand why it doesnt go 2,3,4,5,6 instead it goes 1,2,6,5,4,3
[03:15:54] <aro> id like to preserve the order of the disabled fields
[03:18:56] <aro> the weird part is, if you click resort again - it does it right
[03:19:02] <aro> do it again, and it does the same thing as the first time
[03:25:20] <arc_> it's not ever "doing it right" it's just a coincidence that the result is what you actually want it to do
[03:25:42] <arc_> the code you have written is reversing the order of the disabled fields
[03:26:08] <aro> how can i make it sort them the way I would like it to?
[03:26:10] <arc_> i don't actually know what you want this button to do
[03:26:17] <aro> maxree i think is the one that assisted me in here
[03:26:21] <aro> something like that
[03:26:29] <arc_> robertmaxrees is not here rihgt now
[03:26:46] <aro> when a field is added/removed/disabled/enabled - resort the fields so that they are in 1,2,3,4,5,6
[03:27:52] <arc_> how are they becoming out of order
[03:28:05] <aro> when a field is removed by the library that manages them
[03:28:19] <aro> just trust me, that they get out of order
[03:28:23] <aro> this is to preserve the order
[03:28:50] <arc_> then you need to sort it
[03:29:41] <arc_> this code you have written is not a sort. it just reverses the order of the array elements
[03:30:00] <aro> well robertmaxrees gave it to me in response to the question i had
[03:30:06] <aro> i trusted him!
[03:30:49] <arc_> what was the question
[03:31:37] <aro> how can i sort these fields from 1 to 6
[03:31:47] <aro> with disabled ones at the end
[03:31:51] <aro> and enabled ones at the front
[03:32:27] <arc_> i find it pretty hard to believe that he would have just given you the answer
[03:32:35] <arc_> perhaps this was meant to be just one step of the answer
[03:32:54] <aro> well i gave him some code that was halfway there, and he said this is simplified and does what you want
[03:33:00] <aro> so i took that at face value
[03:33:04] <aro> anyways
[03:33:13] <aro> dont worry about it
[03:33:13] <arc_> he normally does not just write all the code for people. he tries to walk them through everything
[03:33:23] <aro> i can find the chat logs if you wish
[03:34:00] <arc_> i'm not saying i don't trust you. i'm just saying you may have misunderstood his intent
[03:34:19] <arc_> i mean it's also possible he made a mistake
[03:34:23] <arc_> it's not like that has never happened before
[03:34:36] <arc_> or he may have misunderstood your question
[03:34:53] <arc_> regardless, this does not sort anything. it just reverses the order of the elements
[03:35:56] <aro> ok
[03:35:59] <aro> do you ahve any ideas?
[03:40:00] <aro> for the sake of debate, arc_ : https://gist.github.com/barrychapman/e01aa66bae3adbd5ca9728a3e5168b86
[03:42:26] <aro> i think i figured it out
[03:42:43] <arc_> that's not the same question you asked me and also the code he gave you is not what is in this pen
[03:43:09] <aro> he gave me pseudo code. i replace $theParent with the id of the parent
[03:43:10] <aro> so what?
[03:43:49] <arc_> you changed append() to after()
[03:43:53] <aro> he told me to
[03:43:59] <aro> read the gist
[03:44:04] <aro> ....
[03:44:16] <arc_> ok, well either way, this is about what i was expecting
[03:44:16] <aro> [11:45] <robertmaxrees> errr, .after, not .append
[03:44:28] <arc_> this is the answer to only one part of what you want to do
[03:44:34] <arc_> because you only asked about one part
[03:44:44] <aro> so can it be done all in one step?
[03:44:46] <arc_> "preserve the order" isn't the same as "sort things that have become out of order"
[03:45:07] <aro> well when the process actively disrupts the order, i would disagree
[03:45:25] <aro> reversing the order of the elements, is not what i would call 'preserving the order'
[03:46:51] <arc_> well, now we have to go back to my initial question that you apparently didn't think needed to be answered. how do they become out of order
[03:46:54] <arc_> do they need to be numerically sorted
[03:47:01] <aro> yes
[03:47:09] <arc_> or are they in numerical order, but the disabled ones are just between other enabled ones
[03:47:14] <aro> when the library i am using picks one up, and reinserts a new element
[03:47:17] <aro> they are out of order
[03:48:41] <aro> i have fixed it
[03:48:58] <aro> it is 4am almost. my mind is screeching to a halt
[03:49:03] <aro> im lucky i made it this far
[05:36:18] <Duikb00t> When I checked a script of a website I saw someone doing: "$.vegas('slideshow', {"
[05:36:26] <Duikb00t> What is that called? Doing $.vegas ?
[05:58:29] <MarkusDBX> Even though I try to handle an ajax error (jqXHR.status == 401), with .fail(), I still get error for "401 Unauthorized" in chrome.
[05:58:51] <MarkusDBX> I just want to avoid the javascript error, and handle it. telling the user "not logged in".
[05:58:57] <MarkusDBX> any ideas?
[05:59:21] <Duikb00t> MarkusDBX: When you go to the network tab and you execute the ajax call.
[05:59:27] <Duikb00t> What do you receive as response?
[05:59:30] <MarkusDBX> 401
[05:59:34] <MarkusDBX> which is correct
[05:59:38] <MarkusDBX> I expect 401
[05:59:50] <MarkusDBX> it's not a CORS issue or such. I want to get that 401
[06:00:04] <MarkusDBX> but what I don't want is the "angry" Error in the browser.
[06:00:12] <MarkusDBX> I want to handle that 401
[06:00:24] <cannap> no
[06:00:30] <cannap> the 401 error handles you
[06:00:36] <MarkusDBX> seems like it
[06:00:55] <Duikb00t> Maybe some header thing?
[06:01:13] <cannap> you get 401 in chrome
[06:01:17] <MarkusDBX> yeah
[06:01:19] <cannap> you cant remove this
[06:01:20] <MarkusDBX> not in firefox though
[06:01:21] <cannap> in chrome
[06:01:31] <MarkusDBX> I can do console.clear on 401..
[06:01:35] <MarkusDBX> but it seems.. dirty
[06:01:36] <cannap> you talk about the network task?
[06:01:42] <cannap> tab*
[06:02:01] <MarkusDBX> I talk about the console
[06:02:07] <MarkusDBX> I get a 401 error in the console.
[06:02:12] <cannap> and why you want clear this?
[06:02:13] <MarkusDBX> I want to handle it instead
[06:02:22] <cannap> just redirect on 401 xD
[06:02:26] <MarkusDBX> cannap: I want to aboid the error and give the user a message
[06:02:31] <MarkusDBX> *avoid
[06:02:50] <cannap> if(response.status === 401)?=
[06:02:56] <MarkusDBX> yeah I do that
[06:03:00] <cannap> and
[06:03:08] <MarkusDBX> thing is, I still get the browser error
[06:03:17] <cannap> show code
[06:03:25] <cannap> it must work 100%
[06:03:32] <cannap> i use not jquery and i can handle 401 easy
[06:03:52] <MarkusDBX> I guess, I should maybe use native js instead for this
[06:04:46] <Duikb00t> Meh how is calling a plugin like this called? Seems I can't get it working this way: $.vegas('stop');
[06:04:47] <cannap> check jquery ajax has some interceptors
[06:04:52] <cannap> then you can do some global stuff
[06:04:59] <cannap> and not just in the ajax request
[06:05:41] <cannap> @MarkusDBX, i have http://laravel.io/bin/QNM13
[06:05:49] <cannap> its not jquery but jquery should have something
[06:05:55] <cannap> it handles on each request i made
[06:06:10] <cannap> like a middleware
[06:06:41] <cannap> check this also http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11440757/jquery-exceptions-to-global-ajaxsetup-possible
[06:06:46] <cannap> $.ajaxSetup
[06:10:40] <MarkusDBX> cannap: https://jsfiddle.net/235tamvo/1/
[06:12:39] <MarkusDBX> cannap: I guess vue might have more solid functions for this.
[06:13:08] <cannap> yea but vue != jquery
[06:13:11] <cannap> this was jsut a example
[06:13:14] <cannap> just
[06:13:20] <MarkusDBX> Yeah I know
[06:13:26] <MarkusDBX> was referring to your paste
[06:16:04] <cannap> no its not vue itself
[06:16:09] <cannap> i use vue-resource
[06:20:55] <MarkusDBX> I see
[07:10:51] <Duikb00t> hmm
[07:21:18] <Duikb00t> I don't get it: https://github.com/jaysalvat/vegas
[07:22:17] <Duikb00t> What do you have to do in jQuery to call a function like $.vegas('stop'); ?
[07:26:24] <shoky> Duikb00t:  $.vegas = function(method) { ... }
[07:27:38] <shoky> Duikb00t: but that's not what that library is doing, they have  $element.vegas(...)
[07:27:38] <Duikb00t> $.vegas is calling the plugin ?
[07:28:07] <Duikb00t> I've seen someone did: https://www.pastery.net/yvtpwb/ that
[07:28:08] <shoky> $.vegas(...)  just calls that function
[07:28:26] <shoky> well if they did that then i showed how
[07:28:37] <shoky> it's just a function, like any function
[07:28:54] <Duikb00t> Hmm not yet ale to find out where that got set
[07:29:21] <Duikb00t> http://ow.ly/2HBW302j2nB
[07:29:35] <Duikb00t> You can search for " $.vegas('stop'); "
[07:29:44] <Duikb00t> I don't get it where $.vegas = function(... is set
[07:30:19] <shoky> i don't see in their documentation that you can call it like that.. did you see it working?
[07:30:39] <Duikb00t> Yes :)
[07:30:51] <Duikb00t> When you remove the code till you got the main domain.
[07:31:12] <Duikb00t> I just want to add in my code a 'stop' :)
[07:31:19] <shoky> their docs don't show it works, and looking at the library code it doesnt seem that it should work...
[07:31:44] <Duikb00t> Hmm but the website is executing it like it should imo
[07:31:54] <shoky> which website
[07:32:01] <Duikb00t> The one from the ow.ly url
[07:32:22] <shoky> yes, what's the website
[07:32:27] <shoky> that's the js code
[07:32:32] <Duikb00t> just visit the main url :)
[07:32:44] <shoky> how would i know what the main url is
[07:33:05] <Duikb00t> http://ow.ly/kZMz302j2Ai
[07:34:05] <Duikb00t> So once you click it's able to execute:          $.vegas('stop');
[07:34:10] <shoky> it's not using the latest vegas version
[07:34:20] <shoky> it's using a differnt version that does have that $.vegas function
[07:34:23] <shoky> the latest version doesn't
[07:34:24] <Duikb00t> I would like to run vegas stop as well :P
[07:34:26] <Duikb00t> ooh
[07:34:29] <Duikb00t> ><
[07:34:59] <shoky> look in vendor.js  for  $.vegas = function(...
[07:35:31] <Duikb00t> Got that
[07:37:38] <shoky> or here anyways  https://github.com/jaysalvat/vegas/blob/v1.3.2/dist/jquery.vegas.js#L288
[07:37:42] <Duikb00t> Thanks that makes sense:
[07:37:44] <Duikb00t> $('body').vegas('destroy'); ;)
[07:39:39] <Duikb00t> Thanks shoky again
[07:39:51] <shoky> np
[07:52:33] <Duikb00t> Have you ever used it yourself?
[08:00:31] <shoky> nope
[08:20:28] <mauzilla> Hi all, i'm using bootstrap wizard - a couple of my wizard steps are dependant on an Ajax call (and the outcome of that) but by default the wizard skips and goes ahead with the remainder of the wizard steps (moves onto the next step before the ajax call is completed). I understand the logic why this is happening but not to sure how to work around this? What is the best way to work around this?
[08:20:52] <mauzilla> from my understanding I should impliment a promise but how does the promise stop the following javascript to continue?
[08:23:17] <mauzilla> Here is the sample wizard: https://jsfiddle.net/mnd6kgtL/
[08:25:05] <shoky> mauzilla: you can return false in the onNext when you do the ajax, and in the ajax success callback  calll the next method of the plugin
[08:29:07] <mauzilla> ahhh
[08:29:47] <mauzilla> let me see if I can find what method / callback I should use to do the next
[08:30:02] <shoky> the "next" method
[08:33:02] <cannap> promises!
[08:33:10] <cannap> 2016
[08:47:54] <mauzilla> haha
[09:03:15] <Duikb00t> shoky:  :P im trying to attach a custom transition for my 'Vegas2' plugin but it seems im still doing things wrong :P dammit
[10:31:57] <_biff> hi
[10:32:15] <_biff> shouldnt .toggle complete run AFTER animation completed?
[10:32:25] <_biff> because now it runs at the start of animation
[11:35:26] <ahoo> how to detect when an element is being scrolled visible?
[11:40:30] <cannap> viewpoert- top height
[11:50:55] <ia9371> why would you use jquery vs php?
[11:51:16] <taplar> one is a front end language, one is a back end language
[11:51:22] <taplar> they are not compariable
[11:52:30] <ia9371> so if jquery protects a form
[11:52:38] <ia9371> than I can eaily bypass that by
[11:52:43] <ia9371> cross site scripting
[11:53:14] <taplar> ok?
[11:53:50] <ia9371> so i want to make my nav bar like fade in
[11:54:22] <ia9371> than i would want to use jquery
[11:54:39] <taplar> sure, or plain css
[11:58:18] <taplar> if your earlier statement about jquery vs php was about the validation, then of course users can bypass the javascript validation.  a website should never rely only on frontend validation.  the backend always has to do that
[11:58:47] <taplar> fontend validation is for user experience
[11:59:10] <ia9371> so jquery is really useful for front end validation
[11:59:29] <taplar> it can be.  there are plugins specifically for validation
[11:59:42] <taplar> but that's not it's main intention
[12:00:08] <ia9371> but why should i spend time learning jquery?
[12:00:18] <ia9371> what does it do?
[12:00:47] <taplar> it standardizes dom interactions and functional availability between mutliple browsers and browser versions
[12:01:06] <taplar> you don't have to worry so much about what browser, and what version of said browser, your user is using
[12:01:13] <taplar> you focus more on your business logic
[12:01:31] <ia9371> why not php
[12:01:38] <ia9371> or ruby on rails
[12:01:39] <taplar> php doesn't run in the frontend dude
[12:01:49] <taplar> unless something has changed on that front
[12:02:46] * Uhkis now has two x's on the wall
[12:02:55] <Uhkis> great job taplar! :D
[12:03:22] <ia9371> so i can make my image fade in
[12:03:35] <taplar> sure....
[12:03:43] <taplar> but not with php
[12:04:25] <ia9371> but when youre talking about connecting to the database
[12:04:31] <ia9371> with somethign angular
[12:04:44] <taplar> angular can't do that
[12:04:49] <ia9371> theres.. better options
[12:04:49] <taplar> a database is on the backend
[12:04:58] <taplar> your confusing the two different worlds
[12:05:18] <taplar> if your talking about a typical mysql or db2 database
[12:05:31] <Uhkis> ia9371: think: jquery makes the site cool for the user, php/whatever backend makes it work
[12:06:01] <ia9371> so i shoould spend the next month or two
[12:06:05] <ia9371> in my room
[12:06:09] <ia9371> learning jquery
[12:06:19] <taplar> i'm not sure why your taking this tone
[12:06:26] <taplar> what problem are you trying to solve?
[12:06:56] <ia9371> but i just cant understand why jquery
[12:07:08] <ia9371> like what does it do
[12:07:17] <taplar> i already told you
[12:07:23] <ia9371> it makes images fade in and out
[12:07:26] <taplar> different browsers do things differently
[12:07:36] <taplar> and version have less and more functionality provided
[12:07:45] <taplar> jquery standardizes it and fills in potential gaps
[12:07:54] <taplar> it's not just fading in and out stuff
[12:08:01] <taplar> learn.jquery.com  give it a read
[12:08:34] <ia9371> the name j query loooks to be a complete failure
[12:08:34] <taplar> it's entirely up to you to decide if you need it.  vanilla js may work fine for your use case
[12:08:51] <taplar> hokay, take care
[12:08:58] <ia9371> the word query means interactign with the database
[12:09:08] <ia9371> which was a complete failure
[12:09:10] <Uhkis> it most certainly does not
[12:09:10] <shoky> no it doesn't
[12:09:27] <shoky> j comes from js i think, query is querying the DOM
[12:09:38] <ia9371> querying the database
[12:09:43] <shoky> but its name is not the library's main feature, so that's good
[12:09:44] <Uhkis> query is just plain old english
[12:09:55] <shoky> querying the database is a database thing
[12:09:58] <shoky> querying the DOM is not
[12:10:06] <taplar> your asking questions of us.  you are, in fact, querying us
[12:10:08] <ia9371> but yet something like php
[12:10:09] <taplar> we are not databases
[12:10:53] <ia9371> yet this is the most popular javascript library\
[12:11:03] <shoky> not because of its name.
[12:12:41] <sqram> if you have two $('foo').click(..)  , is the first one guaranteed to finish before the second one?
[12:13:03] <ia9371> i guess the question would be
[12:13:04] <sqram> two exactly same handles for the same element
[12:13:09] <ia9371> what are you trying to do
[12:13:19] <ia9371> are you trying to make an image fade in?
[12:13:24] <sqram> me?
[12:13:27] <taplar> why would you stack handlers on a single element?
[12:13:36] <sqram> taplar: out of curiosity
[12:13:37] <taplar> that same handler that is
[12:13:46] <taplar> iirc, one should finish before the other, yes
[12:13:54] <shoky> sqram if they were added like that one after another, then yes.  (of course, not considering anything asynchronous like ajax or animations)
[12:13:57] <ia9371> or are you trying to protect a form from computer hackers
[12:14:06] <sqram> got it
[12:14:14] <ia9371> in the first case jquery would be useful
[12:14:16] <shoky> ia9371 jquery is definitely not to "protect forms"
[12:14:20] <shoky> nobody every said it is
[12:14:33] <shoky> no js library can "protect forms" anyway
[12:14:41] <Uhkis> ia9371: javascript should never be used for securing anything because user can just turn it off
[12:15:22] <Uhkis> or modify it during "runtime"
[12:16:28] <ia9371> but jquery is in 83% of every website on the internet
[12:16:39] <shoky> not for protecting forms
[12:16:43] <taplar> so is html
[12:16:52] <shoky> why the "but"
[12:16:55] <taplar> not used for security either
[12:17:03] <Uhkis> taplar: i think that's a bit higher than 83% ;)
[12:17:07] <ia9371> and you say that form validation is completely uselesss
[12:17:08] <taplar> :D
[12:17:17] <taplar> no, not useless
[12:17:20] <ia9371> because i can just disable javascript]
[12:17:23] <taplar> unguarenteed
[12:17:33] <taplar> you cannot rely on the user to protect your stuff
[12:17:37] <shoky> it's to make the user experience nicer, that's it
[12:17:42] <taplar> you have to do that on the backend where you have complete control
[12:18:01] <Uhkis> ia9371: js form validation is for informing, backend validation is for securing
[12:19:21] <ia9371> so javascript helps make the website look pretty
[12:19:28] <ia9371> while php andn python and ruby
[12:19:39] <ia9371> basically make sure that everything is secure
[12:19:46] <taplar> those are your core
[12:19:56] <taplar> your application guts
[12:20:10] <taplar> jquery is your makeup, :)
[12:21:00] <Uhkis> way to make frontend sound gay :D
[12:21:25] <taplar> eh, who hasn't worn makeup
[12:21:35] <ia9371> ive never wore makeup
[12:21:45] <taplar> you must not have had an older sister
[12:22:05] <ia9371> i just dont understand sitting in my room for months on end trying to learn jquery
[12:22:15] <taplar> i don't enter
[12:22:19] <taplar> *either
[12:22:35] <ia9371> when something like ruby or python
[12:22:36] <taplar> which is why i asked earlier what problem you were trying to solve
[12:22:55] <taplar> you learn the part of jquery that solves that problem, at the time, if indeed it can be addressed with jquery
[12:23:12] <Uhkis> so... why are you here ia9371?
[12:23:26] <ia9371> jquery is like the makeup
[12:23:34] <ia9371> while ruby is like the backend
[12:24:04] <Uhkis> while something like ruby is the backend*
[12:24:05] <shoky> people go learn cosmetics, and fashion, and design
[12:25:01] <ia9371> i mean sitting in my dark desolate room studdying jquery
[12:25:07] <shoky> turn the light on
[12:25:10] <ia9371> theres so many () and .
[12:25:14] <taplar> lol
[12:25:23] <ia9371> it doesnt make any sense
[12:25:39] <ia9371> for what to make a picture fade in
[12:25:40] <Uhkis> i bet ia9371 has never seen lisp
[12:25:46] <ia9371> or a nav bar
[12:25:56] <taplar> if all your wanting is to fade a picture, then that's easy
[12:26:22] <taplar> your either show('slow') or hide('slow')
[12:26:26] <taplar> or a use of animate()
[12:26:37] <Uhkis> or fadeIn()
[12:26:38] <taplar> or adding/removing classes that have transition opacity or something on them
[12:26:41] <taplar> ^
[12:27:12] <taplar> lots of ways
[12:27:29] <ia9371> i mean it definately doesnt protect against hackers trying to put malicious code into my database
[12:27:41] <taplar> we never said that
[12:27:42] <Uhkis> you're correct
[12:27:42] <ia9371> so ...
[12:27:44] <shoky> then dont learn jquery when you need to protect against hackers
[12:27:45] <taplar> why do you keep repeating that?
[12:27:48] <shoky> stop repeating yourself
[12:27:52] <shoky> you're getting annoying and boring
[12:28:26] <Uhkis> heh, programming principle DRY applies to irc too
[12:28:29] <ia9371> maYBE i can make my nav bar
[12:28:34] <ia9371> fade in
[12:29:26] <shoky> how's that tornado coming along taplar
[12:29:40] <taplar> i survived!  or i'm talking to you from beyond
[12:29:44] <ia9371> but the original question was
[12:29:52] <taplar> lots of people without power, but i'm good in my area
[12:29:52] <shoky> wee
[12:29:54] <Uhkis> tornado?
[12:30:03] <taplar> two days ago was a big storm here
[12:30:07] <ia9371> why shoould i sit in my desolate dark room for months trying to learn jquery
[12:30:15] <taplar> to which we said you should not
[12:30:24] <taplar> you learn what solves your current problem
[12:30:26] <ia9371> i should learn something else
[12:30:27] <shoky> ia9371 please stop repeating yourself
[12:30:43] <Uhkis> ia9371: if you need to sit in a room for months to learn jquery, better start thinking of other career options
[12:30:50] <taplar> i'm not going to learn how to rebuild a car if i just need to change my oil
[12:31:43] <ia9371> but what if i want my nav bar to.. fade in
[12:31:49] <Uhkis> taplar: what?! where's your curiosity?! :D
[12:31:50] <taplar> hokay, take care
[12:32:06] <taplar> it's currently in my ps3 game, :D
[12:32:36] <Uhkis> blah, pc masterrace! :D
[12:32:56] <ia9371> jquery was originally meant o "query" the database
[12:33:06] <ia9371> it was very unsuccesful and failes
[12:33:42] <Uhkis> we fed the troll way too long
[12:33:51] <taplar> ya
[12:33:59] <shoky> indeed
[12:33:59] <taplar> i had a sliver of hope though
[12:35:02] <taplar> for anyone who is reading the logs, or came in late, and is not aware, no.  jquery was never meant to interact with databases.
[12:35:25] <Uhkis> :D
[12:35:29] <shoky> right it was meant to protect against hackers
[12:35:39] <taplar> obviously
[12:35:50] <arc_> hi i'm looking for jquery firewall but i can't find it, plz help
[12:36:14] <shoky> tornado ate it
[12:36:26] <taplar> i mean, i remember when i wanted to be a hacker and i went to a website, but they had all those protections up.  i was like, FK!  I stopped that day.
[12:36:45] <taplar> killed my dream of joining the cia
[12:37:37] <shoky> shoulda used jquery
[12:40:37] <taplar> that would be an interesting epitaph
[12:42:12] <taplar> yes Uhkis, i googled 'epitaph'
[12:43:14] <Uhkis> taplar: the record label?
[12:43:26] <taplar> i saw that too. lol
[12:50:24] <SlimmyJimmy> jQuery home page shows malformed JSON
[12:50:51] <SlimmyJimmy> Shouldn't all keys be double-quoted?
[12:51:31] <taplar> watcha talking about?
[12:52:03] <shoky> that's not JSON
[12:52:12] <SlimmyJimmy> what is it then?
[12:52:15] <shoky> javascript
[12:52:21] <SlimmyJimmy> hmmm
[12:52:51] <taplar> wait, isn't it JSON, just not a string containing JSON?
[12:52:53] <shoky> JSON is a text format for serializing data
[12:53:06] <shoky> no
[12:53:09] <taplar> always confuses me
[12:53:43] <shoky> json keys must be quoted
[12:53:50] <shoky> and json doesn't have functions :)
[12:54:09] <SlimmyJimmy> but the data value on the home page doesn't
[12:54:22] <shoky> what data value
[12:54:27] <taplar> so i guess that's just object notation
[12:54:29] <shoky> oh that
[12:54:32] <shoky> that's a javascript object
[12:54:41] <shoky> as i said, there's no json there
[12:55:08] <SlimmyJimmy> well, Its very similar to JSON, all it would is double quotes
[12:55:23] <taplar> unnecessary though
[12:55:27] <shoky> yes it's similar because JSON is based on JS objects :)
[12:55:28] <SlimmyJimmy> then it would qualify as JSON
[12:55:32] <shoky> but it's a totally different thing
[12:55:44] <shoky> it doesn't need to qualify as JSON
[12:55:46] <shoky> it's not json
[12:55:49] <shoky> and is not being sent as json
[12:56:01] <shoky> it's being sent as a query param
[12:56:11] <SlimmyJimmy> okay then, makes sense
[12:56:15] <shoky> /api/getWeather?zipCode=97201
[13:19:03] <metastableB> Hi. I would like to have some suggestions on something. I'm just starting to learn front end dev using jquery and one of the pplication i'm developing has a use case where I append div's inside a div. I.e. there is a bigger container and as the user interacts children div's are formed
[13:19:28] <metastableB> the children div's have some complicated HTML and CSS applied to it and I would like to know the best way to organize that
[13:20:03] <metastableB> for now I'm using a string varable in javascript and using the $('class-name') to append the string to the parent div
[13:20:18] <metastableB> the string variable contains the html/css for the elements I'm appending
[13:20:41] <metastableB> I'm not comfortable with this approach of embedding html inside js files as it makes development much harder for me.
[13:20:50] <metastableB> I would like a cleaner method for htis
[13:21:10] <metastableB> can anyone suggest a work flow they use?
[13:23:05] <metastableB> just restating the problem, I need to appendChild() div's to a parent. The children div have complicated html/css styling. For now I construct the html/css from within the JS function as a string and then append this.
[13:23:09] <taplar> metastableB: take a look at handlebar.js
[13:23:16] <metastableB> I would like to know if there is a better way
[13:23:27] <taplar> there are various libraries out there that help you do templating
[13:24:17] <metastableB> taplar: the kind of templating I want to do is dynamic. I'll look into handlebar.js
[13:24:19] <metastableB> thanks :)
[13:24:28] <taplar> sure
[14:21:29] <maxpen> Hey guys
[14:21:30] <maxpen> need some help
[14:23:25] <adamsilver> How can I make this keep working even after the form's replacement: https://bpaste.net/show/b05654fdfdc7 ... It's only working on the first time. It looks like the binding is lost when the form is replaced by the form coming from the server
[14:24:33] <taplar> your replacing the form that the event is bound on?
[14:26:16] <adamsilver> taplar: yes
[14:26:38] <maxpen> guys check this out https://jsfiddle.net/master412160/tLb120jd/
[14:26:48] <taplar> you'll either need to bind a delegate to a parent element or rebind after you replace the form
[14:26:58] <maxpen> so I got Profile Author, Participant, 1
[14:27:10] <maxpen> I mean Profile Author, Participant, ,
[14:27:35] <maxpen> and that is because of the php  Idid here
[14:27:35] <maxpen> echo $all_roles[$role]['name'] . "<span class='seperator'>,</span> ";
[14:27:48] <maxpen> but the thing is how what is the best way to handle the seperation
[14:28:40] <taplar> why echo the commas?
[14:29:21] <adamsilver> taplar: I will try the delegate, thanks
[14:30:34] <maxpen> taplar I got no idea what the best way is to handle the situation
[14:30:45] <maxpen> through jquery or php the only thing is I know jquery better then php
[14:30:51] <taplar> maxpen: i'm not entirely sure what your saying your issue is
[14:30:59] <maxpen> the issue is
[14:31:07] <maxpen> if I remove <span class='seperator'>,</span>
[14:31:15] <maxpen> I will get the roles without comma seperation
[14:31:26] <maxpen> my goal is comma seperation the most effective method through either php or jquery
[14:31:30] <Yepp> selectize.js's docs is quite unclear. http://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/ what's the difference between load and addOption() ?
[14:31:34] <maxpen> and no comma after the last role
[14:31:42] <Yepp> https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/blob/master/docs/api.md
[14:32:08] <taplar> maxpen: you should be able in php to push all the things to an array and then join that array on ','
[14:32:17] <taplar> that wouldn't put a , on the end
[14:32:57] <maxpen> well taplar that sounds logic but out of my scope
[14:33:20] <maxpen> let me share the code
[14:34:00] <taplar> best bet would be to hit up ##php about that
[14:34:14] <shoky> Yepp: for addOption you provide the data itself,  for load you are provided with a callback that you can call (also at a later time) and pass the data to it
[14:34:44] <Yepp> yea, that's why I said it's a bit unclear. In the examples, the docs used load
[14:34:52] <Yepp> and used a callback
[14:34:58] <Yepp> but the callback function is not even there
[14:35:17] <Yepp> the example is under the Remote Source section
[14:35:39] <Yepp> oh so you mean, the callback() function is built-in already?
[14:35:58] <maxpen> taplar I could but this is a really small deal https://gist.github.com/bustapaladin/c0a9b04a44b235f59e07d62791ebc8db
[14:36:42] <taplar> all the same, it's outside the scope of this room's topic
[14:37:04] <Yepp> shoky, is the callback that the docs used built-in? Cause, originally I was thinking of doing ajax and then using addOption
[14:37:35] <taplar> take a look at the docs for array_push() and join()
[14:38:54] <shoky> Yepp: not sure what you're asking, and mm i think what you said should work.. try
[14:39:22] <Yepp> i'll try to ask one at a time
[14:39:25] <shoky> Yepp: looks to me like in that remote source exampls they're using `load` not like it's documented..
[14:40:01] <Yepp> is the callback function used in the example at the docs built in? or I need to make one myself?
[14:40:46] <shoky> Yepp: the one called `callback` that is passed to the load function?
[14:40:53] <Yepp> yea
[14:41:11] <shoky> Yepp: yes that's built-in, it's passed to the load function you provide
[14:41:17] <Yepp> cause it seems redundant for a plugin to have multiple ways in doing only one thing. Using load and passing it to callback and doing Ajax and passing it to addOption
[14:41:24] <Yepp> that what's confused me
[14:41:34] <shoky> Yepp: but anyway yes their docs suck but it looks like `load` also gets a `query` param which is what you typed in the textbox
[14:41:48] <shoky> Yepp: and then based on this query they do the ajax
[14:41:56] <Yepp> there's even 2 version of load shoky
[14:41:58] <shoky> and then when the ajax is done they call the callback
[14:42:10] <Yepp> there's one here also https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/blob/master/docs/api.md
[14:42:25] <Yepp> anyway, thanks
[14:42:56] <Yepp> the load() in that link i provided doesn't use query if I am not mistaken
[14:43:43] <Yepp> shoky: this explains it much clearly http://stackoverflow.com/a/25573741/6514422
[14:43:56] <taplar> ok, am i crazy or does that http://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/ have some sort of fade effect on the bottom of the page?
[14:44:10] <Yepp> yes it does have it
[14:44:19] <Yepp> felt the same way this morning too hahaha
[14:44:23] <taplar> driving me crazy
[14:45:45] <taplar> i now have a mission to figure out what that is and kill it
[14:45:56] <Yepp> a gradient?
[14:46:56] <taplar> dunno, it's almost like something position fixed to the bottom with a background that is white but transparent, but i don't see anything fixed there
[14:47:16] <Yepp> it seems a gradient to me
[14:47:23] <Yepp> haven't looked at it tho
[14:49:02] <shoky> it's box-shadow on #theme-selector
[14:50:06] <taplar> ah!
[14:50:15] <taplar> gracias
[14:55:34] <WhirledPress> Hey all, I need to create a way to have a list of items that "knows" when it is longer than it's parent container so it can add "...more..." links rather than scrolling. Anybody know of a plugin for this kind of thing?
[15:08:30] <Uhkis> WhirledPress: i think parent().children().length and some logic is all you need
[15:09:32] <WhirledPress> The logic is the hard part though. It involves css which I am terrible at.
[15:11:16] <WhirledPress> What I want ideally is this: given a series of articles, I want to autogenerate a menu of articles and topics within but only show the items visible on the screen in the menu (with generic more-links on top and bottom if needed).
[15:16:00] <WhirledPress> when you append a jquery object to an  html element, then modify the jquery object, does it modify the appended content?
[15:18:24] <shoky> a jquery object is just a wrapper around a collection of elements. whatever you do to the jquery object is done to the elements, whether they have been appended or not
[15:19:16] <WhirledPress> excellent. Thanks shoky!
[15:19:31] <shoky> np old-timer
[15:19:44] <shoky> (assuming that's you ;p)
[15:20:07] <WhirledPress> it is. Been forever. How are things there?
[15:20:33] <shoky> quieter than elsewhere in the world currently, it seems ;p
[15:20:52] <WhirledPress> For the first time in a while, maybe?
[15:21:27] <shoky> donno, it's always in waves, ups and downs
[15:22:46] <WhirledPress> It is so mind-numbingly boring here I wouldn't know how to handle it.
[15:22:59] <shoky> heh, FL right?
[15:23:06] <shoky> or GA?
[15:23:06] <WhirledPress> very close. GA
[15:23:11] <shoky> yah
[15:23:55] <WhirledPress> It's funny, all the things I bitch about here...nothing I imagine compared to there. LOL
[15:25:17] <shoky> lol. mostly hot and humid here :(
[15:25:58] <WhirledPress> Right. Here it's 94F and I don't leave my loft. We keep it at 69F I don't even go outside.
[15:25:59] <shoky> at least pizza is on the way
[15:26:27] <shoky> eek
[15:27:52] <WhirledPress> Have you spent any time with WordPress recently. They are slowly slowly moving towards js
[15:28:34] <shoky> nope
[15:28:40] <shoky> what do you mean?
[15:29:21] <WhirledPress> Well, it seems like for the longest time, WP was all php and JS was avoided. Now, they are slowly adding more JS to the WP Core.
[15:30:58] <WhirledPress> I had a friend write the simplest little js code snippet for wp and he gets probably 100$ a month in royalties off of it.
[15:31:30] <shoky> hmm how does that work? :)
[15:32:28] <WhirledPress> He sells it through a commercial repository called Envato. He sells 10-20 copies a month and only changes like 10$ for his gallery generator plugin
[15:32:49] <WhirledPress> *charges
[15:33:34] <shoky> the plugin is the js snippet?
[15:34:19] <WhirledPress> Yeah. sort of. It uses the default php plugin format so it's available through WP. But then it just injects a js. code snippet to any page you want.
[15:35:35] <WhirledPress> And you can encapsulate functionality with "shortcodes" in [brackets] so you can add [gallery] to your wp content and it calls the js code to build a gallery.
[15:36:23] <shoky> cool
[15:37:15] <WhirledPress> I'm working on a way to automate content menus based on <h2> elements. Currently you have to generate a menu manually.
[16:26:19] <WhirledPress> I keep using jsfiddle, but it keeps telling me my errors are in jquery--which I know is wrong. Is there a better testbed for debugging?
[17:28:12] <cangelosx> is it possible to override the val function of a specific object instance?
[17:41:19] <ttal> how do i toggle only the ul.submenu of the .menu-item-has-children > a i am clicking. At the moment i have:       $( ".menu-item-has-children > a" ).click(function() { $( "ul.sub-menu" ).toggle(); });          it is toggling all ul.submenu on the page.
[17:42:40] <ttal> i need to somehow select the parent of the anchor clicked, then toggle only its ul.sub-menu
[18:38:09] <WhirledPress> ttal, use jsfiddle or equivalent for a test case and post the link. It's a lot easier
[18:39:21] <ttal> WhirledPress: ok no worries. I figured it out: needed; $(this).parent().children('ul.sub-menu').toggle();
[18:39:55] <WhirledPress> sorry, didn't see the time. LOL
[21:43:33] <SlimmyJimmy> So what's the status of jQuery, why do some people say they don't use it anymore, is it being replaced by something better?
[21:51:48] <systemfault> Nah, it's just that now, browsers don't need as much "normalization" as they used to... so adding jQuery only to have a nicer syntax is a price not everyone wants to pay anymore.
[21:52:11] <systemfault> Also, the popularity of the JS frameworks which don't use jQuery doesn't help
[22:00:26] <SlimmyJimmy> systemfault are they popular because they are better?
[22:00:50] <systemfault> You cannot compare them directly.
[22:01:00] <Dan39> i think hype is something to do with it
[22:01:14] <SlimmyJimmy> even without the need for normalization , it doesn't seem like that would be a reason to dump jQuery completely, it has many other benefits in my opinion
[22:01:20] <systemfault> jQuery is a DOM abstraction layer, it makes DOM manipulations more convenient.
[22:01:46] <systemfault> Frameworks are usually higher level, you pretty much never have to directly manipulate the DOM when using them.
[22:02:11] <systemfault> So, while they don't "directly replace" jQuery, they just make it unecessary
[22:02:22] <SlimmyJimmy> hmm, higher level generally means less power and flexibility
[22:02:34] <systemfault> Says who?
[22:02:37] <SlimmyJimmy> me
[22:02:48] <systemfault> It's always a matter of tradeoffs.
[22:02:54] <SlimmyJimmy> if an API makes your life easier, its because its made a lot of decisions for you
[22:03:16] <SlimmyJimmy> i know its about tradeoffs but you sounded like you didn't believe what I said.
[22:03:37] <SlimmyJimmy> easier API means less power and flexibility, I find that to be generally true
[22:04:06] <systemfault> Yes.. unfortunately, that argument can easily be reduced to a level where it becomes absurd.
[22:04:21] <SlimmyJimmy> so the statement is absurd then huh?
[22:04:28] <systemfault> In some ways.
[22:04:41] <SlimmyJimmy> so you make no commitment either way then. :)
[22:04:59] <SlimmyJimmy> so your lips move but you don't really say anything
[22:06:01] <systemfault> SlimmyJimmy: JS is too high level, so less powerful than Java... Java is too high level, so less powerful than C++... C++ is too high level, so less powerful than C... C is too high level, so less powerful than assembly...
[22:06:08] <systemfault> That's how it becomes absurd.
[22:06:19] <systemfault> You use the proper tool for the job at hand.
[22:06:45] <SlimmyJimmy> well, that I can agree with, use the proper tool for the job
[22:07:06] <systemfault> When I write an application, I don't even want to deal with DOM manipulations, I _want_ the framework to do them for me.
[22:07:39] <SlimmyJimmy> this is interesting, I have only used JavaScript and jQuery, so what framework do you use to get DOM manipulations done easy?
[22:08:17] <systemfault> SlimmyJimmy: I'm a bit biased toward React... but plenty of people use Angular 1/2, Ember, Vue, Cycle.. etc
[22:08:30] <SlimmyJimmy> I remember reading an article awhile back where the author said, "we got too many frameworks". :)
[22:08:37] <systemfault> That said, if you're not writing an application, you're just making your life shittier for no reason.
[22:08:51] <systemfault> (By using a framework)
[22:09:08] <SlimmyJimmy> Aren't those all just higher levels of JavaScript just like jQuery?
[22:09:56] <SlimmyJimmy> I've only head of Angular so I'm assuming the others are similar
[22:10:04] <Dan39> i recently just had to make a choice like this
[22:10:24] <systemfault> SlimmyJimmy: jQuery is really low level.
[22:10:31] <Dan39> am going to try going with jquery, was about to go with angular...
[22:10:57] <systemfault> SlimmyJimmy: jQuery doesn't have opinions in terms of application architecture
[22:11:22] <systemfault> jQuery could be the lowest level of a framework.
[22:11:29] <Dan39> main reason is i felt angular took more learning of the framework, and others would have to learn it too to work on site at all, and we arent web developers, so others probably wont know angular.
[22:11:42] <systemfault> Like with Angular IIRC (Where jQlite is used only when jQuery is not available)
[22:12:30] <SlimmyJimmy> I knew I should have been a shoe salesman
[22:12:59] <Dan39> angular does look freakin awesome though tbh
[22:13:27] <SlimmyJimmy> I'm learning towards learning more about Angular myself, just because it seems more popular
[22:13:49] <Dan39> jquery is still very popular i think
[22:13:51] <systemfault> Angular 1 is by far the most popular framework... but it's showing its age now and Angular 2 will be released soon
[22:14:02] <Dan39> angular2 IS released, no?
[22:14:09] <systemfault> Not that I know
[22:14:48] <Dan39> ah it may still be in rc phase
[22:14:54] <systemfault> Yeah
[22:15:12] <Dan39> tho they dont make it off like that :P
[22:15:23] <systemfault> jQuery will still be popular for a long time... not every website needs to be a SPA :P
[22:16:40] <Dan39> i like that jquery isnt a google project <_<
[22:17:16] <Dan39> and yes i still use firefox!
[22:17:53] <systemfault> Google have their own thing... and it looks as if that JS lib was written by a Java dev.
[22:18:53] <Dan39> well despite who developed the actual code, it angular still says it is made by google :P
[22:22:17] <Dan39> hmm
[22:22:24] <Dan39> wikipedia says " jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library in use today, with installation on 65% of the top 10 million highest-trafficked sites on the Web."
[22:22:25] <Dan39> heh
[22:22:30] <systemfault> Yup
[22:23:45] <systemfault> Back when you had to support IE7/IE8... you couldn't even think of not using jQuery
[22:24:33] <Dan39> i mostly want it to make doing ajax requests easier, not necessarily much DOM manipulation
[22:24:45] <Dan39> but we will see, just getting started
[22:29:45] <SlimmyJimmy> you think jQuery is better for mutiple page websites?
[22:30:51] <Dan39> SlimmyJimmy: who are you asking?
[22:31:05] <Dan39> system fault i assume? :P
[22:31:20] <SlimmyJimmy> yes, he made a statement about SPAs
[22:31:34] <Dan39> o
[22:31:48] <SlimmyJimmy> I guess I just live in a bubble like I said before, all I have done for past few years is JavaScript and jQuery
[22:32:31] <SlimmyJimmy> the implication that the newer frameworks are better at SPAs?
[22:33:28] <SlimmyJimmy> I need a chart that compares all this to break it down for me in less than 5 minutes. :)
[22:33:38] <Dan39> haha me too
[22:33:51] <Dan39> i spend way too much time researching libs/frameworks
[22:38:46] <systemfault> jQuery is fine for "websites".
[22:38:55] <systemfault> A SPA isn't a typical website.
[22:47:31] <Ova> 	
[22:47:34] <Ova> aaaaaaaa
[22:50:09] <Dan39> systemfault: and jquery wouldnt be recommended for making a SPA?
[22:51:17] <systemfault> Dan39: jQuery is extremely low level, it doesn't help you with application concerns... routing/controllers/state management/views and their update depending on state
[22:51:32] <systemfault> You'd basically have to build your own framework on top of it.
[22:51:38] <systemfault> And it could work.
[22:52:24] <Dan39> i think i understand, but tbh its above my experience level :P
[22:58:06] <SlimmyJimmy> jQuery is client side, why would all the other things you mentioned be something you would expect jQuery to do?
[23:01:13] <SlimmyJimmy> or any other client-side framework for that matter
[23:09:39] <systemfault> I expect a framework to do it. Not a simple DOM abstraction tool like jQuery.
[23:12:12] <SlimmyJimmy> but why would client-side frameworks do that, are you talking about server-side frameworks, if so why compare those to jQuery?
[23:12:47] <systemfault> SlimmyJimmy: o_O
[23:12:58] <systemfault> I'm talking about client-side SPA frameworks.
[23:13:50] <SlimmyJimmy> thats some wierd stuff to me, I might just keep on living inside my bubble.
