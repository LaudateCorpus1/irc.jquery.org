[05:59:30] <halo> Hi, how to get procent from 0-100 instead; http://jsfiddle.net/csornmo/pquavh5r/14/
[05:59:42] <halo> when scrolling
[06:01:10] <Cork> you mean invert the percent value?
[06:01:52] <halo> Cork: exacly
[06:02:06] <Cork> (100 - Math.round()) + "%"
[06:02:08] <halo> it should start with 0 and end with 100%
[06:06:46] <halo> Cork: thx :)
[14:17:13] <Es0teric> can anyone help me with this? https://kopy.io/KhfT2#line-18
[14:17:17] <Es0teric> its a scoping issue
[14:17:21] <Es0teric> how do i fix that?
[14:17:45] <robertmaxrees> is this the actual code?
[14:17:54] <Es0teric> yes
[14:17:58] <Es0teric> well...
[14:18:06] <robertmaxrees> is found_posts declared in another function?
[14:18:12] <Es0teric> no
[14:18:16] <robertmaxrees> can you share more?
[14:18:30] <robertmaxrees> this code, as-is, should work just fine.
[14:19:37] <Es0teric> ah
[14:19:46] <Es0teric> i had that declared twice due to a merge
[14:19:47] <Es0teric> on git
[14:19:54] <robertmaxrees> heh
