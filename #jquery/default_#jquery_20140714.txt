[00:15:49] <uuzila> I want a script for show and hide sequence.. do any one can help me?
[00:18:29] <Cork> show and hide sequence?
[00:18:41] <uuzila> Yes
[00:19:40] <Cork> uuzila: you mean like .toggle('slow') or what?
[00:19:50] <uuzila> like I have some data to be fillled on a form in text field later if everything is right means I need to show a user another vaid field to filll.
[00:19:55] <uuzila> simple as that
[00:20:25] <uuzila> nope .. in terms of text field
[00:20:35] <Cork> uuzila: if you don't know how you should get it going at all, it means you should read a jquery tutorial
[00:20:55] <Cork> uuzila: questions should be about what one is missing, not "do it for me"
[00:21:09] <uuzila> sorry dude
[00:21:18] <uuzila> Faux Pas
[00:28:12] <donni> hi
[00:29:03] <donni> can someone please help me to solve this ? http://jsfiddle.net/qa8ZL/ it won't remove the form after adding the new form
[00:30:01] <Cork> donni: you need to use delegated event handlers
[00:30:18] <Cork> currently you add the remove handler to the one element that exist on load
[00:30:27] <Cork> but none other
[00:30:43] <donni> how to do that?
[00:31:31] <donni> by using .live?
[00:31:46] <Cork> donni: http://jsfiddle.net/qa8ZL/1/
[00:31:53] <Cork> donni: live is dead, you can't use it anymore
[00:32:05] <iArivu> used wildcard selector? donni
[00:32:23] <Cork> donni: also when you're at it, i would add a wrapper adoung each section
[00:32:38] <Cork> that way you can remove the id you're currently using
[00:33:36] <Cork> ugg...
[00:33:39] <Cork> and don't use <div class="clear"></div>
[00:33:48] <donni> it's only remove the button
[00:36:53] <Cork> donni: http://jsfiddle.net/qa8ZL/2/
[00:37:59] <donni> Cork, it still doesn't remove the form
[00:38:24] <donni> iArivu how does the wildcard selector works?
[00:38:38] <iArivu> nope its not
[00:38:55] <iArivu> Cork solution works
[00:39:04] <Cork> donni: but there is only one form
[00:39:11] <Cork> if you remove the form you can't add new input fields
[00:40:56] <iArivu> donni ? is it solved the problem?
[00:44:11] <donni> iArivu it's almost solve the problem, i want to remove the form as well
[00:44:40] <donni> thank you Cork, i'll try to figure out how to remove the form
[00:44:56] <iArivu> when u remove the last input? donni
[00:45:01] <Cork> donni: ok, so when remove is clicked the form should be removed
[00:45:08] <Cork> then how would you add new fields?
[00:45:21] <Cork> everything would be gone if you remove the form
[00:45:29] <Cork> (including the add button)
[00:46:29] <donni> maybe by leaves one form
[00:46:39] <Cork> there is only one form
[00:46:40] <donni> so i could add a new form
[00:47:04] <donni> i could add the new form before deleting the last one
[00:47:10] <Cork> last one??
[00:47:14] <Cork> there is only ONE
[00:47:20] <donni> by clicking the Add Lesson +
[00:47:35] <Cork> if you remove the form "Add Lesson +" will be removed too
[00:47:44] <Cork> as it is inside the form
[00:48:02] <donni> the add lesson is out of the form id
[00:48:23] <donni> it have it's own
[00:49:10] <donni> maybe by deleting the field1
[00:49:25] <donni> *the id=field1++
[00:50:46] <iArivu> filed1 will the case
[00:50:52] <donni> hi Cork i thing this one is working http://jsfiddle.net/qa8ZL/2/
[00:50:56] <donni> thank you
[00:51:08] <iArivu> what if the user remove field1 after adding filed2?
[00:51:21] <Cork> iArivu: /2/ removes the ids
[00:53:04] <iArivu> Cork got it
[01:03:00] <donni> disconnected -_-
[01:10:46] <donni> Cork, it does work here http://jsfiddle.net/qa8ZL/2/
[01:10:57] <donni> but won't work on my localhost
[01:11:04] <donni> do i miss something?
[01:11:25] <donni> i'm sure of using the same jquery version
[01:12:14] <Cork> donni: did you do the html changes i did?
[01:13:08] <donni> i did the same
[01:14:00] <Cork> donni: what jquery version are you using?
[01:15:24] <donni> Cork: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js
[01:15:36] <Cork> then no jquery isn't the problem
[01:19:05] <donni> this is confusing XD
[01:25:11] <donni> Cork, do the parent of this element $('#profs .input-append') will affect the event?
[01:25:34] <Cork> donni: no
[01:25:44] <Cork> not the parent of those elements
[01:25:59] <Cork> but the .input-append element does matter
[01:26:48] <donni> but the .input-append is still there
[01:47:46] <Giri> Hi Friends
[02:02:00] <d3m0n> Hey guys, I am trying to grab a dynamic height then I want to attach a window scroll and depending on how much you've scrolled through that height it will adjust the opacity. ex: Height = 700px, if the scroll bar is at the very top, opacity: 1 if you have scroll to 700px opacity: 0 and everything in between to make a nice transition. Any suggestions on where to start?
[02:03:51] <Cork> d3m0n: bind a scroll event handler
[02:04:25] <Cork> and css('opacity', (700 - scrollHeight) / 700)
[02:07:57] <d3m0n> Cork: Thanks, I'll try it out
[02:26:01] <d3m0n> Cork: THat works but it's changing the opacity the wrong way
[02:26:26] <d3m0n> I think I might have stated it wrong
[02:26:39] <d3m0n> Top: should actually be 0 opacity and bottom 1
[02:27:08] <sir> When doing a mouseenter with a span can I devlare the class also ?
[02:27:27] <Cork> d3m0n: the ya, that is the opposite of what you said before
[02:28:06] <Cork> d3m0n: css('opacity', scrollHeight / 700)
[03:31:22] <sir> can anyone tell me if this js is okay ?  http://pastebin.com/VRa5vd8N
[03:31:48] <Cork> "is ok"??
[03:31:56] <Cork> ok in what context
[03:31:58] <Cork> compared to what?
[03:32:04] <sir> lol sorry
[03:32:57] <sir> I mean can I select the span and class the way I have set
[03:35:46] <Cork> sir: i doubt you have an element <about>
[03:36:17] <sir> I have a class about
[03:36:25] <sir> span class=about
[03:36:29] <Cork> your selector isn't looking for a class
[03:36:36] <Cork> it looks for en element
[03:36:58] <Cork> sir: $() uses css selectors
[03:37:16] <CrowX-> sir, if the class name is "about", then use ".about"
[03:37:34] <sir> ahh okay thanks
[03:37:55] <CrowX-> sir, also, if the class name is on the span element, then you'll need it "span.about"
[03:38:13] <sir> Was about to ask that hehe
[03:38:39] <CrowX-> "#nav_headers span about" means "the element with class name .about, who is a child element of a span element who is a child element of an element with id #nav_headers"
[03:38:51] <Cork> CrowX-: no
[03:39:06] <Cork> if it has a . it would mean that
[03:39:12] <CrowX-> yeah
[03:39:17] <CrowX-> that's what I meant
[03:39:39] <CrowX-> I was telling him why he probably doesn't need space between span and .about
[03:40:10] <sir> Got ya

[06:30:58] <djam90> Hi. I'm guessing this channel gets ALOT of questions so I will try keep it short. I am using jQuery UI accordian, I have 5 accordians and 5 buttons to click to trigger them to open. I can select the first accordian and open it and it works. But if I loop through them with .each(), I get function undefined. Code is here: http://pastebin.com/9iKnS1Ja
[06:32:03] <djam90> So basically I can open one accordian by targeting it directly, but if I put it in an .each() loop then it says function undefined?
[06:36:09] <decx> because it's accordion and not accordian, accordian is a saint in south america
[06:36:42] <decx> also don't put a click handler inside an each
[06:36:58] <decx> $('.fremax-accordian-trigger').click will bind to all anyway
[06:39:24] <Cork> or even better, delegate it to a common parent
[06:40:30] <ph88> does anyone here use select2 ?
[06:40:35] <donnig> hi Cork , do you know what affecting this http://jsfiddle.net/5TQm7/ which make the .addlesson doesn't work? but it does work here http://jsfiddle.net/qa8ZL/2/
[06:41:00] <ph88> would like to know how to give the buttons a data-id
[06:41:37] <crooksey> Hi, I am using jquery to try and get the contents of json from a URL, the logs show this happening, but I can't seem to return the result inside a div, http://paste.ofcode.org/Wuxsaujaqd8xaxsdPw6882
[06:41:56] <Cork> donnig: .input-append doesn't exist
[06:41:57] <crooksey> Note I have had to spell script as "scrip" in order to paste my example due to my firewall
[06:42:01] <djam90> OMFG
[06:43:25] <djam90> decx, I need the click handler inside the each, because there are 5 triggers and 5 accordiOns and they are in order, so button 1 opens accordion 1
[06:43:43] <decx> doesnt matter
[06:44:32] <Cork> donnig: also addlesson is set on the label not the button
[06:44:57] <djam90> but I am using .eq(index) where index comes from the .each... ?
[06:45:25] <decx> index is the first arg in most methods
[06:45:38] <djam90> you kidding right?
[06:45:43] <decx> no
[06:46:13] <v0lksman> is there a way on form.submit() to determin which button was clicked to submit the form?
[06:46:30] <Cork> djam90: var triggers = $('.fremax-accordian-trigger'); $().on('click', func() { $('.fremax-accordian').eq(triggers.index(this)); })
[06:46:42] <Cork> decx: and that statement isn't really true
[06:46:56] <Cork> v0lksman: not cross browsers
[06:47:05] <thebloggu> I'm trying to build a multi row sortable table with jquery ui sortable. Right now i have this test case: http://jsfiddle.net/xNVc6/1/. Can someone help me?
[06:47:17] <Cork> v0lksman: best option is to bind a click handler on the button and set a value based on what button was clicked
[06:47:51] <decx> eh, then it's a lot and not most Cork ;)
[06:48:05] <Cork> decx: that isn't even true
[06:48:14] <decx> cmon don't bust my balls here
[06:48:17] <Cork> .each does
[06:48:20] <Cork> .map doesn'
[06:48:23] <Cork> *'t
[06:48:25] <decx> css does
[06:48:26] <Cork> .filter doesn't
[06:48:28] <decx> prop does
[06:48:30] <decx> filter does
[06:48:33] <Cork> no
[06:48:35] <decx> yes
[06:48:35] <davesleep> anyone here used jcrop alot?
[06:48:37] <Cork> first is an element for filter
[06:48:42] <decx> is it?
[06:49:02] <Cork> hmm no
[06:49:05] <Cork> (has to check)
[06:49:10] <decx> i'm sure it is
[06:49:14] <Cork> it is
[06:49:17] <decx> i used it like return i > 5
[06:49:19] <Cork> "Function( Integer index, Element element )"
[06:49:30] <donnig> Cork, finally, i've been stuck here for 5 hours xD
[06:49:59] <donnig> thank you Cork
[06:50:02] <Cork> decx: what annoys me the most is that they arn't consistent about (index, elm) vs (elm, index)
[06:50:07] <Cork> donnig: np
[06:50:24] * sacho never uses .each
[06:50:35] <Cork> its my biggest annoyance with jquery
[06:50:37] <v0lksman> Cork: thanks!
[06:50:43] <decx> what has el,index?
[06:51:24] <Cork> decx: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[06:51:48] <decx> hehe
[06:51:48] <djam90> Cork, that code didn't work for me
[06:51:53] <decx> that is confusing indeed
[06:52:10] <djam90> Cork, http://pastebin.com/rMnk5nhZ
[06:52:10] <decx> oh right i remember
[06:52:28] <decx> i did map the other way around and spend 20 minutes looking at the screen like an idiot
[06:52:39] <decx> then it dawned on me to look at the api docs
[06:52:41] <Cork> djam90: do console.log(triggers.index(this))
[06:52:47] <Cork> djam90: that should be the index
[06:53:18] <djam90> Cork true it is the index
[06:53:22] <djam90> it works on the 1st item
[06:53:23] <djam90> but not the rest
[06:53:33] <sacho> I think it's index, element when `this` is set to element, and element, index otherwise.
[06:53:44] * sacho points accusingly at `this, the culprit for most bad things.
[06:53:53] <Cork> djam90: then the indexes doesn't lineup
[06:54:03] <djam90> It does log the index for all, but only opens the first one
[06:54:21] <djam90> I have at least 5 accordians and triggers though, surely the second should work at least
[06:54:40] <sacho> surely you should set up a fiddle with your html
[06:54:58] <Cork> djam90: also 	$(triggers).on => triggers.on()
[06:55:03] <Cork> no need for the extra $()
[06:55:09] <djam90> ah
[06:55:20] <Cork> but ya, you need to make a testcase
[06:55:25] <Cork> cause the code looks valid
[06:58:16] <djam90> Fiddle as requested: http://jsfiddle.net/Gm3bn/
[06:58:52] <decx> huh
[06:58:59] <decx> looks like you just need one
[06:59:31] <djam90> I want button 2 to open the "Premium Quality" accordion
[06:59:41] <djam90> button 3 to open the "ready to go" accordion
[07:00:21] <decx> it's one accordion not 6
[07:00:38] <djam90> there are 6 accordions?
[07:00:47] <djam90> 6 divs
[07:00:59] <decx> you init 6 separate accordions
[07:01:18] <decx> if you want to open a specific panel with a button there's a method for that
[07:01:28] <decx> .activate(i)
[07:01:43] <djam90> .activate method is deprecated
[07:01:54] <decx> what is it now?
[07:02:02] <djam90> you have to use the setter for the "active"
[07:02:02] <decx> active
[07:02:29] <djam90> I'm not sure how to have them all as one accordion instead of 6 seperate ones
[07:03:11] <djam90> add accordion to the parent element
[07:03:12] <djam90> ARGH
[07:04:57] <sacho> djam90, all your "inner" accordions have only one element in them.
[07:05:02] <djam90> damn
[07:05:14] <djam90> need 1 accordion not 6 :(
[07:05:22] <sacho> why?
[07:05:31] <decx> observe http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Gm3bn/1/
[07:06:59] <sacho> I thought the inner ones were supposed to be accordions, too.
[07:07:02] <sacho> oh well.
[07:07:52] <decx> an accordion with one bellow is just something to get a fire started
[07:15:14] <BillCriswell> 1 accordion is too many.
[07:15:49] <davesleep> anyone use jcrop quite a bit?
[07:15:56] <davesleep> i cant seem to resize on the fly
[07:21:59] <crooksey> I am using jquery to try and get the contents of json from a view, the logs show this happening, but I can't seem to return the result inside a div, http://paste.ofcode.org/Wuxsaujaqd8xaxsdPw6882
[07:24:52] <decx> your callback function is missing a closing curly
[07:29:11] <crooksey> decx: which line?
[07:30:22] <decx> dont be like that, just look at the code
[07:30:35] <donnig> how to input this symbol '+' into .append() method ?
[07:30:56] <crooksey> decx: yea I am, I am not usually a front end developer I am trying to get something demod for proof of concept
[07:31:48] <donnig> Cork, any idea on how to input this symbol '+' into .append() method ?
[07:31:51] <decx> closing all the curlys you opened isnt exactly a front end thing ^^
[07:32:36] <donnig> i want to put it as a normal character inside the append, not as a meta-character
[07:32:55] <crooksey> according to my editor, they are all closed
[07:33:58] <decx> ready, button, json. that's 3 ({
[07:34:11] <decx> and you have 3 closing })
[07:34:18] <decx> but what about function(data){
[07:34:30] <ecky--ptang-zoob> When inside a mouseout event, can you detect the current dom element that the mouse cursor moved into? For example when you mouse out a picture, can you get the element next to the div if you move out horizontally?
[07:36:47] <decx> ecky--ptang-zoob elementFromPoint
[07:37:18] <crooksey> decx: #9 closed on #18, #10 closed on #17 and #13 closed on #15
[07:38:01] <decx> nope
[07:38:13] <decx> on 15 you close 11
[07:38:18] <decx> oh wait
[07:38:22] <m1su__> his curlies are fine
[07:38:36] <decx> yeah i see
[07:38:54] <crooksey> So is there any reason why this isn't working?
[07:39:11] <crooksey> Obviously there is, but is it Jquery related?
[07:40:58] <BuenGenio> g'day all
[07:41:03] <BuenGenio> Anyone using DataTables?
[07:41:04] <BuenGenio> I have a question an answer to which I haven't managed to find in the docs - when using a remote AJAX call is it possile to tell DataTables the number of total results, so that it can thus calculate the total number of pages matching a specific search string?
[07:41:10] <NoiseEee> crooksey: <scrip> versus <script>?
[07:41:27] <crooksey> NoiseEee: thats just a purposeful typo
[07:41:36] <crooksey> I cant paste <script> tags on this firewall
[07:41:53] <NoiseEee> lol ok. well offhand, what kind of IP is 0.0.0.0
[07:42:04] <crooksey> Local test server
[07:42:11] <NoiseEee> crooksey: is that where this actual page is running?
[07:42:15] <crooksey> yes
[07:42:24] <NoiseEee> ie: the URL when you load this page is 0.0.0.0 and on the same port?
[07:42:43] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy @ crooksey
[07:43:05] <crooksey> Hence why my console logs say  [HTTP/1.1 200 OK 93ms]
[07:43:47] <NoiseEee> so your actual URL is also on port 6543 then
[07:44:06] <NoiseEee> ie: webpage AND xhr/json request
[07:44:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How would you get the X and Y coordinates from elementFromPoint?
[07:44:53] <NoiseEee> crooksey: is that really all the code in your page?
[07:44:56] <crooksey> NoiseEee: yes
[07:45:41] <NoiseEee> crooksey: try changing the input to an actual button; possible that your 'submit' button is actually resubmitting the page.   <button type="button" id="btnSubmit">Get Recent Orders</button>
[07:46:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> decx?
[07:46:16] <crooksey> NoiseEee: tried that before
[07:46:19] <crooksey> Made no difference
[07:46:38] <NoiseEee> crooksey: well offhand, at that bare code, no i can't see why it isn't working then.
[07:46:38] <crooksey> http://paste.ofcode.org/32UNFssxk6UuSNez2PjDH5Y
[07:46:49] <crooksey> NoiseEee: see log here ^
[07:48:13] <NoiseEee> crooksey: you see a JSON response in firebug / response?
[07:48:33] <crooksey> No..
[07:48:48] <phrearch> hello
[07:49:34] <phrearch> im trying to post a form to a new window, but somehow this only works once
[07:49:43] <crooksey> NoiseEee: When I click the button I see it loading the JSON url
[07:49:46] <crooksey> Thats it.
[07:49:52] <phrearch> when i do a window.open('', 'formresult') again, it stays empty
[07:50:05] <phrearch> triggering this in the form's submit event
[07:50:17] <NoiseEee> crooksey: but when you visit that actual page in your browser you get a JSON response?
[07:50:36] <crooksey> { "account number": "416" }
[07:50:56] <donnig> can i combine .toggle() with accordion?
[07:51:08] <decx> ecky--ptang-zoob same as always, event.pageX and event.pageY
[07:51:17] <NoiseEee> crooksey: so then its not actually returning a key of "result"
[07:51:51] <NoiseEee> crooksey: you're telling <span id="result"> to update with the value of your JSON response with the key "result".
[07:52:23] <NoiseEee> crooksey: but if you're not actually getting any response / you don't see the data returned in firebug/whatever you are tracking your xhr in, then that needs to be solved first
[07:52:42] <crooksey> NoiseEee: I have also tried using just data
[07:52:49] <crooksey> E.g. return the full result
[07:53:03] <crooksey>  $("#result").text(data);
[07:54:33] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have 5 stars that change color when you hover over them. I need to detect when the mouse moves out of a star if it's still inside a certain div or not => I need to know if he's still inside the star rating div or not. How to do this?
[07:54:36] <crooksey> NoiseEee: In my console i can see "XHR finished loading: GET url...."
[07:54:50] <crooksey> So I would assume it has loaded and read the URL
[07:55:00] <crooksey> (and its contents, e.g. the jquery)
[07:55:21] <NoiseEee> crooksey: you should be able to actually see the response itself somewhere  in some tab, crooksey. i don't use firefox so offhand not sure where
[07:55:55] <thinkxl> ecky--ptang-zoob: mouseover, mouseout events
[07:56:14] <crooksey> NoiseEee: I am looking at chrome dev console and firebug
[07:56:28] <crooksey> Is this a jquery error thats causing me not to get a response
[07:56:31] <crooksey> or my json server?
[07:56:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I try that, but then I do console.log($currentEl.closest(".rating")); and it always gives something in return... when it's out of the div it should return null or something
[07:56:59] <NoiseEee> well there is some response; either its a 200 with your JSON or otherwise crooksey
[07:57:05] <ecky--ptang-zoob> $currentEl here is $(this) inside a mouseout event
[07:57:11] <decx> closest().length to test
[07:57:13] <thinkxl> ecky--ptang-zoob: will need to see a code example
[07:57:17] <NoiseEee> http://juliepagano.com/blog/2014/05/18/javascript-debugging-for-beginners/?utm_source=javascriptweekly&utm_medium=email#ajax-requests @ crooksey perhaps
[07:57:38] <NoiseEee> crooksey: you should see something in the 'response' tab of the xhr call.
[07:57:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I think this is pretty clear without a code example
[07:58:40] <thinkxl> ecky--ptang-zoob: you are asking for help, I'm asking a favor to help me help you
[07:59:24] <crooksey> NoiseEee: http://s12.postimg.org/bea96l3ct/Screenshot_140714_15_57_51.png
[07:59:29] <crooksey> Thats the xhr log
[07:59:59] <NoiseEee> crooksey: don't look there.  see the URL i pasted. "Network", not "Console".  and then filter XHR requests.
[08:00:49] <crooksey> NoiseEee: http://paste.ofcode.org/qQXbFNVAjNsSdpA5acxjaz
[08:00:54] <decx> ecky--ptang-zoob http://jsfiddle.net/decx/w7GtQ/
[08:00:57] <crooksey> Yea 200 response
[08:01:12] <NoiseEee> crooksey: you need to view the ACTUAL RESPONSE. see the URL
[08:01:21] <NoiseEee> that is not helpful what you pasted
[08:01:27] <ecky--ptang-zoob> tx decx, brilliant
[08:01:49] <decx> but anytime you need to rely on elementFromPoint you're doing something fucky
[08:01:49] <NoiseEee> crooksey: NETWORK tab in chrome developer tools, filter icon for XHR, make the request, view the "response" or "preview" tab
[08:03:45] <crooksey> NoiseEee: thanks
[08:03:50] <crooksey> I see I am getting http://paste.ofcode.org/cECktj8Y94uF5pEQpJpL4n
[08:04:01] <crooksey> So looks like my json server isn't returning JSON?
[08:04:05] <NoiseEee> crooksey: right
[08:04:12] <NoiseEee> crooksey: looks like its converting quotes
[08:06:09] <donnig> anyone can help me to solve this http://jsfiddle.net/Zh2WD/ problem?
[08:07:13] <donnig> I can not add new checklist at the second new checklist button after clicking the add lesson button http://jsfiddle.net/Zh2WD/
[08:07:39] <decx> delegate before you generate
[08:08:02] <decx> .addchecklist doesnt exist when this script gets executed
[08:08:13] <crooksey> NoiseEee: thank you sooooo much
[08:08:26] <NoiseEee> np crooksey
[08:08:29] <crooksey> You have genuinely made my day
[08:08:58] <decx> sorry for looking through your curlys earlier crooksey i still see double from last night
[08:09:12] <crooksey> decx: np
[08:09:16] <donnig> decx
[08:09:16] <donnig> decx how to delegate ?
[08:09:25] <crooksey> Im a python dev thrown in with Jquery today
[08:10:35] <decx> donnig instead of $('.addchecklist').bind('click', function (e) { do $('#profs').on('click','.addchecklist',function(e){
[08:12:03] <decx> donnig and read this: http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[08:13:41] <donnig> thank you decx, i does work, but it also triggering another field, how to avoid this action? http://jsfiddle.net/Zh2WD/1/
[08:14:02] <decx> well you are appending to input-append2
[08:14:56] <decx> and there are lots of them after a while
[08:15:27] <donnig> yes, so i've to generate another class for each new lesson?
[08:15:55] <decx> traverse to the right one from your clickhandler
[08:15:56] <donnig> or there is way like using .closest() ?
[08:16:30] <decx> instead of $('.input-append2').append you could do $(this).next('.input-append2').append
[08:19:10] <donnig> it works decx, it still confusing for me to choose the method. thank you decx
[08:24:03] <Zisef> Damn about pages are the hardest.
[08:28:37] <frank_o> How come I can't define global variables like this? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/4DJV2/
[08:29:09] <aftab> Hi, I have infinite scroll installed in my wordpress site and it works fine on the home page and search page using .nav-links as navigation links and .prev-link to find the next page content for infinite scroll. But unfortunately when I open any post page directly in the browser it doesn't let infinite scroll to work  even though the .nav-links and .prev-link code is there and also infinite
[08:29:09] <aftab> scroll javscript is also loaded, please help
[08:29:49] <decx> frank_o an object literal cant be accessed until it's finished
[08:29:49] <BillCriswell> frank_o: Need a bit more context here.
[08:30:39] <frank_o> BillCriswell: Trying to reference the first variable in the second and third variables like var GLOBAL_VAR = { main: $(this), sub1: main.find('#sub1'), sub2: main.find('#sub1') };
[08:31:02] <frank_o> decx: Worst fears confirmed then, thank you :)
[08:32:36] <frank_o> aftab: Not that it's of any help, but I highly recommend https://github.com/expandtheroom/jquery-infinite-scroll-helper
[08:33:30] <frank_o> aftab: Also you need to set up a testcase
[08:34:18] <aftab> frank_o: thanks but infinite scroll is already loaded just need to make it work on post page which somehow isn't working whenever there is query string in the url like p=1 p=2
[08:34:40] <davetarmac> morning
[08:34:46] <davetarmac> I have a page that needs to check the location via geoIP and set a currency to that location. I have put this code in http://pastie.org/9389079 but because the page refreshes (thanks Magento!) it calls it everytime and causes a loop - is there a way around this?
[08:36:29] <Sal> is there a way to control an element top (y)?
[08:36:35] <thinkxl> davetarmac why you using a setTimeout ?
[08:36:38] <duch_kazatel> "element top"?
[08:36:52] <Sal> i need change soem html when an element top is less that 92
[08:37:16] <thinkxl> davetarmac what I'm thinking is that the first time you load the page, save it in localStorage then next time check if exists and pull it from there, if not try it to save it in localStorage again
[08:37:58] <Sal> duch_kazatel, top position of an element relative to the document
[08:38:12] <duch_kazatel> Sal you can check out .offset().top
[08:38:31] <Sal> no, sorry i was wrong
[08:38:34] <duch_kazatel> kay
[08:38:40] <Sal> the top relative to the browser window
[08:38:47] <Sal> i need do know when it moves
[08:38:55] <duch_kazatel> why, if I might ask?
[08:39:35] <Sal> because when p.top() < scrolling.div.0need to do something
[08:40:07] <duch_kazatel> then get the offset top of the element and subtract the scrollTop() of the window.
[08:40:10] <Sal> i want to add a shadow under the toolbar only when the main div scrolls under it
[08:40:13] <frank_o> people are still using Magento?
[08:40:31] <Sal> duch_kazatel, oh, ok, i'll try
[08:40:33] <duch_kazatel> Sal $('element').offset().top - $(window).scrollTop() is your calculation.
[08:40:38] <Sal> thanks!
[08:41:36] <davetarmac> thinkxl: I'm using a timeout because Magento is slow :)
[08:41:43] <davetarmac> actually, doesn't need to be in one anymore
[08:41:52] <Sal> duch_kazatel, perfect! thanks
[08:42:11] <duch_kazatel> davetarmac your code doesn't make sense.  the page has rendered by the time that code executes.
[08:43:02] <davetarmac> duch_kazatel: but even without it, changeCurrency() still kicks off a page reload
[08:43:10] <davetarmac> so I need to store a flag somewhere
[08:43:21] <thinkxl> davetarmac localStorage
[08:43:28] <duch_kazatel> davetarmac without seeing the rest of your code, that tells me you're running ajax somewhere or doing something very strange.
[08:45:08] <davetarmac> duch_kazatel: I'm just running what was defined as an onClick event when the page runs to set the currency based on the IP location
[08:45:28] <duch_kazatel> davetarmac that means you're running ajax against a geoip service ;)
[08:45:50] <davetarmac> not so much...
[08:46:02] <davetarmac> doesn't matter - I'll look at this localstorage thingy
[08:46:09] <duch_kazatel> then how are you getting geolocation information AFTER the page has loaded?
[08:48:41] <davetarmac> duch_kazatel: instantiating a module with GeoIP module, getting the country code and running it through a switch() and setting it
[08:48:52] <davetarmac> be much nicer to do it before the page loads to be honest
[08:49:08] <duch_kazatel> then you have to do it in your backend.
[08:49:31] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, you're hitting a third party service via ajax or you're using JSONP.
[08:50:17] <davetarmac> I'm checking a dat file locally to check the long/lat
[08:51:06] <duch_kazatel> that's not going to change anything i'm saying, but OK :)
[08:51:51] <davetarmac> duch_kazatel: I guess I didn't fully understand what you were saying
[08:56:45] <thinkxl> davetarmac: you are mixing JS with PHP from there, is weird, you must have the way to choose the currency in the back-end and that will make your work easier
[09:00:48] <davetarmac> the changeCurrency() is js, the geoIP stuff is php, I think I have to mix them
[09:01:07] <duch_kazatel> davetarmac you can check the IP in the request and check it from ther.
[09:01:22] <duch_kazatel> *there. i'd change out your lib.
[09:03:54] <davetarmac> duch_kazatel: I'm not entirely sure how to do that... I guess I'll google it
[09:04:47] <donnig> how to add new tab of channel here on kiwi irc?
[09:09:07] <decx> every channel opens in a new tab
[09:09:19] <decx> /join #channame
[09:16:33] <jessica583> hey everyone. How can I make this http://hastebin.com/amabaqutar.vhdl cause the window to scroll to a position 50px higher than where it currently does? http://hastebin.com/amabaqutar.vhdl
[09:17:04] <duch_kazatel> jessica583 by subtracting 50 from your scrolltop value.
[09:17:35] <duch_kazatel> $target.offset().top - 50
[09:18:55] <duch_kazatel> also, window.location.hash = target; smells to me.
[09:19:23] <jessica583> doing top - 50 doesn't change anything though
[09:19:34] <duch_kazatel> right - window.location.hash = target; is likely your issue.
[09:21:07] <jessica583> duch_kazatel: yep getting rid of that fixed it thanks :)
[09:21:20] <duch_kazatel> you know that hrefs will automatically append to your URL, right?
[09:22:07] <duch_kazatel> so you can do <a href="#theDiv">this is a link</a> and then <div id="theDiv">this is a div</div> and it just works.
[09:22:24] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/8kMFF/
[09:22:58] <jessica583> yes that works normally but in my case it ruins the page layout
[09:23:27] <duch_kazatel> O.o that shouldn't touch your page layout.
[09:26:11] <jParkton> duch when connecting to my mongodb if I do .find() it gives me "cannot whatever on undefined"
[09:26:24] <jParkton> cannot call method
[09:26:42] <jParkton> but I do connect
[09:27:28] <duch_kazatel> jParkton .find() is for the DOM, not mongo.
[09:28:03] <duch_kazatel> also, use people's full nicks when mentioning them - most of our clients will autonotify us when you do that :)
[09:28:12] <jParkton> ohmai
[09:28:20] <jParkton> https://gist.github.com/jparkton/1f10f53f4dcb18e570c8
[09:28:31] <duch_kazatel> mongo might have a .find(), but i'm not sure.  not much experience with it.
[09:28:53] <jParkton> according to the mongo manual thing I am supposed to do db.admin.find({collection});
[09:28:55] <duch_kazatel> you might have more luck in a channel about mongo.
[09:28:56] <jParkton> or similar
[09:29:01] <jParkton> true
[09:29:03] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[09:29:12] <jParkton> but its also node
[09:29:25] <thinkxl> jParkton: in your getCollection is not a find method
[09:29:26] <jParkton> so maybe #Mongo+Node.js
[09:29:27] <jParkton> lol
[09:29:33] <thinkxl> are not any find method
[09:29:38] <thinkxl> sorry my poor enlgish
[09:29:42] <jParkton> oh tru
[09:29:51] <jParkton> didnt even think about that lol
[09:30:00] <jParkton> I fail at scope so much
[09:30:01] <duch_kazatel> jParkton either way, you're derailing the channel again
[09:30:03] <jParkton> its really sad
[09:30:13] <jParkton> Oh snap
[09:30:18] <jParkton> ma bad
[09:30:43] <duch_kazatel> no bigger, just be aware :)
[09:30:45] <thebope> lol
[09:31:39] <duch_kazatel> *bigger, rather.
[09:31:47] <duch_kazatel> still recovering from my weekend D:
[09:42:37] <Nyoom> Is there a way to detect if capslock is enabled without typing or clicking?
[09:43:30] <AusME> Nyoom: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/348792/how-do-you-tell-if-caps-lock-is-on-using-javascript
[09:45:04] <jParkton> dang googlebot
[09:45:54] <jessica583> hey duch_kazatel in that hastebin I posted earlier is there a more simple way to do var taget = this.hash, $target = $(target);  ?
[09:48:22] <duch_kazatel> that's pretty simplo imo.
[09:48:24] <duch_kazatel> *simple.
[09:48:55] <jessica583> Okay just wanted to be sure thanks again!
[09:49:59] <duch_kazatel> jessica583 keep in mind that scrolling on click like that is kind of annoying to end users.
[10:06:56] <DansVC> Hi, someone could have a look to my website and say what you think (and the code too), because I'm looking for a professional opinion
[10:07:04] <DansVC> http://ray-dee-oh.com/
[10:07:06] <thebloggu> can someone help me implement drag and drop of multiple rows in a html table (i have a checkbox as the first column in each row that should indicate which rows to move)? tried using jquery ui's sortable but no luck
[10:07:27] <DansVC> thebloggu do you have a jsfiddle?
[10:08:08] <thebloggu> DansVC: sure, http://jsfiddle.net/p8YxP/
[10:08:33] <jParkton> DansVC: also ##Design
[10:08:39] <jParkton> they are the site gurus
[10:08:40] <jParkton> lol
[10:08:56] <DansVC> thx jParkton
[10:10:01] <DansVC> thebloggu I think that I have one ideia
[10:10:20] <DansVC> why you dont add a class wich is checked
[10:11:25] <DansVC> wait I'm going to made it
[10:11:48] <duch_kazatel> DansVC any time you need instructions on how to browse your site should be a red flag.
[10:13:58] <DansVC> red flag, like an alert?
[10:14:35] <duch_kazatel> "red flag" as in the colloquialism. question why you're doing it in the first place.
[10:14:50] <duch_kazatel> also, your site takes a tremendous amount of time to load.
[10:15:35] <DansVC> I have a cache application, so if you use it again will be slower
[10:15:38] <DansVC> *faster
[10:15:51] <duch_kazatel> on subsequent loads you're still over 4 seconds.
[10:16:32] <duch_kazatel> and now it's broken for me.
[10:16:55] <DansVC> duch do you still there for 30 minutes?
[10:16:59] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:17:06] <DansVC> cause I have to go dinner xD
[10:17:20] <jimi_> Is there an 'on' event for checked? or just clicked and then is:checked attribute?
[10:17:20] <duch_kazatel> i might be, but I can't guarantee I won't be busy.
[10:17:26] <uskerine> should this work? $('#myLink').click();
[10:17:27] <uskerine> ?
[10:17:27] <DansVC> ok
[10:17:29] <duch_kazatel> jimi_ you want the 'change' event.
[10:17:43] <uskerine> where I have <a id="myLink" hred="whateverFoo">foo</a>
[10:17:52] <uskerine> href
[10:17:55] <duch_kazatel> uskerine it should, yes.
[10:18:17] <DansVC> thebloggu try to add a class to the row that's checked
[10:18:57] <uskerine> what can I do if it does nothing? -I do not see anything in console either-
[10:19:19] <jimi_> duch_kazatel, I did something like $('#foo').on('change',function() { alert('here'); }; but it didn't alert.. but 'click' did, that's why i was wondering.
[10:19:23] <duch_kazatel> uskerine http://jsfiddle.net/9x2ce/
[10:19:39] <thebloggu> DansVC: well, the problem doesn't seem that i can't find the ones that are checked but i can't add them to the list of rows to sort
[10:19:43] <duch_kazatel> jimi_ then you have something funky going on.  what is #foo ?
[10:19:57] <jimi_> duch_kazatel, <input id="foo" type="checkbox" />
[10:19:58] <duch_kazatel> uskerine that usually means you're binding something wrong.
[10:20:07] <duch_kazatel> jimi_ can you make a fiddle?
[10:20:10] <jimi_> duch_kazatel, could def be something w/ caching.
[10:20:18] <duch_kazatel> jimi_ wut
[10:20:42] <jimi_> duch_kazatel, Caching locally js.. maybe it's not actually updated in my local environment. Checking.
[10:21:48] <thebloggu> can someone take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/p8YxP/ and tell me how can i get the checked rows to be dragged?
[10:22:11] <uskerine> can that .click() be inside another .click()
[10:22:11] <uskerine> ?
[10:22:20] <duch_kazatel> uskerine depending, yes.
[10:22:40] <uskerine> $('#tempButton').click(function(){      $('#myLink').click();    });
[10:22:51] <duch_kazatel> uskerine does #tempButton exist on pageload?
[10:23:07] <duch_kazatel> also, are you trying to create a popup or anything weird like that?
[10:23:12] <uskerine> it does
[10:23:24] <uskerine> plus I have an "alert" before the .click and it is displayed
[10:23:27] <duch_kazatel> then you're probably tripping your browser's popup clocking mechanism.
[10:23:31] <duch_kazatel> *blocking
[10:23:35] <uskerine> no
[10:23:48] <duch_kazatel> fiddle up.
[10:23:51] <uskerine> I am trying to move away from a page when an AJAX POST  is completed
[10:24:02] <uskerine> so I leave the current page if success and move to another web page with a list on it
[10:24:18] <uskerine> I see
[10:24:45] <uskerine> but if it would be pop-up blocking related, shouldn't firefox say something about it?
[10:24:47] <duch_kazatel> uskerine something about that seems fishy to me.
[10:29:13] <jimi_> duch_kazatel, it was a cache issue, ty :)
[10:29:20] <duch_kazatel> jimi_ 'kay
[10:31:54] <Fishy> duch_kazatel: you mention me a lot
[10:32:13] <Fishy> thats probably because you help more people than anyone else lol
[10:32:30] <duch_kazatel> Fishy woah - I had NO idea somebody had that nick D: i'm sorry!
[10:32:55] <Fishy> lol its fine i dont even notice it
[10:38:32] <BillCriswell> Way to go duch_kazatel.
[10:39:30] <blakespot> oy
[10:40:18] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell i know right?
[10:43:19] <blakespot> $(document).scroll(function() { console.log($(document).scrollTop()); });
[10:43:38] <blakespot> That gives the amount the page has scrolled as scroll happens
[10:43:54] <blakespot> I have two columns on this page
[10:44:11] <blakespot> By default the left one is fixed and only right scrolls
[10:44:54] <blakespot> I've now got a need to let the left one scroll if the mouse is over it, keeping the right col where it is, not moved
[10:45:20] <blakespot> So I need to find out how far ad div (col) has scrolled --- not the page in general, as I need values for both left and right cols
[10:45:28] <blakespot> Does jqeury give me this?
[10:45:50] <duch_kazatel> blakespot it sure does - http://api.jquery.com/scrolltop/
[10:46:33] <blakespot> ok so not just total page
[10:46:38] <blakespot> thanks
[10:47:02] <duch_kazatel> yeah check out the docs for that one.
[10:50:02] <uskerine> how can I "select"  two ID's?  so, do the same for $('#foo1') and $('#foo2')
[10:50:13] <duch_kazatel> the same you would with css.
[10:50:19] <uskerine> just comma?
[10:50:23] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[10:50:27] <uskerine> thanks
[10:50:29] <duch_kazatel> '#foo1, #foo2'
[10:50:55] <duch_kazatel> as long as you're between quotation marks, you can use any CSS selector.
[10:51:09] <DansVC> back :D
[11:13:25] <WeiJunLi> I want to click on an image and display the next 6 images on anohter div, cannot identify the problem -> http://pastebin.com/yreN8YZe
[11:14:31] <duch_kazatel> WeiJunLi for starters you're using a lot of .next() there.
[11:14:38] <duch_kazatel> mind creating a jsfiddle of what you're trying to do?
[11:15:57] <WeiJunLi> duch_kazatel: will be hard to do a jsfiddle because i'm using a mix of apis on the code and I've just pasted the piece of code that is blocking me from going forward
[11:16:06] <WeiJunLi> the error is on the $.each part
[11:16:19] <WeiJunLi> alot of .next() because each .next() means an id position
[11:16:22] <duch_kazatel> WeiJunLi you're doing an awful lot of document traversal that you don't need to do.
[11:16:26] <WeiJunLi> Do you have any other solution for that?
[11:16:34] <WeiJunLi> What is your solution ?
[11:16:54] <duch_kazatel> without seeing what you're doing an more code, it's hard to suggest anything.
[11:17:57] <WeiJunLi> thats all js code I've. basically I click on an image it opens bigger and at the righ side opens a list with 'Related Images' which are the next 6 images I've opened to be bigger
[11:19:33] <WeiJunLi> duch_kazatel
[11:19:41] <duch_kazatel> *"i have"
[11:20:05] <duch_kazatel> what version of jquery are you using?
[11:20:10] <WeiJunLi> last one
[11:20:18] <duch_kazatel> don't use .attr()
[11:20:21] <duch_kazatel> use .prop()
[11:20:42] <duch_kazatel> don't declare vars inside of if statements.
[11:21:16] <duch_kazatel> add a class to all your images, and select that class instead of your DOM traversal funk.
[11:21:53] <frank_o> Any suggestions for dealing with very long if statements? Maybe abstracting them into some well laid out function or something?
[11:22:06] <duch_kazatel> frank_o depends on the case.
[11:22:19] <duch_kazatel> but usually what you want is abstraction.
[11:22:42] <frank_o> Gotcha
[11:22:47] <WeiJunLi> all my images have the same class but I pretend ot open the src=
[11:22:50] <WeiJunLi> why not keep with the src?
[11:23:25] <duch_kazatel> WeiJunLi .attr()
[11:23:30] <duch_kazatel> don't use .attr() - use .prop.
[11:23:37] <WeiJunLi> duch_kazatel: already changed
[11:23:40] <duch_kazatel> select on a class instead of your crazy DOM traversal - start there.
[11:24:11] <WeiJunLi> changed to .prop but gives me the same error
[11:24:33] <duch_kazatel> those aren't going to fix things magically.  we're making things easier.
[11:25:04] <WeiJunLi> duch_kazatel, ok next?
[11:25:26] <duch_kazatel> pase your updated code into a fiddle ;)
[11:25:33] <duch_kazatel> fake the images by hardcoding them.
[11:31:15] <WeiJunLi> duch_kazatel: as i told is hard to put it on the jsfiddle is mixed up with other things
[11:31:42] <WeiJunLi> I'm not js coder but i'm telling that the error is only on the $.each and everything else is working nice
[11:31:49] <WeiJunLi> why do I need to jsfiddle it
[11:32:09] <duch_kazatel> because it's almost impossible to help just by reading.  your code is strange.
[11:32:14] <WeiJunLi> what you will try to do on jsfiddle you can just tell me here to try
[11:32:18] <duch_kazatel> it's much easier to show you how to make it easy.
[11:32:25] <duch_kazatel> okay - fix the each then.
[11:32:29] <duch_kazatel> sorry to waste your time.
[11:32:37] <WeiJunLi> lol jesus
[11:32:41] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[11:35:20] <duch_kazatel> WeiJunLi it's not hard at all to setup a fiddle for this btw.
[11:35:49] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/8Z2F9/
[11:35:58] <duch_kazatel> just stick in your rendered html and you're basically done.
[11:36:29] <WeiJunLi> lol
[11:36:49] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/8Z2F9/1/ <- more sane whitespace and formatting.
[11:37:11] <duch_kazatel> $(this).prop('src', "imgnext" + i); might fix it.
[11:38:28] <WeiJunLi> tried that already dont solve
[11:38:46] <WeiJunLi> and paste the js code on the jsfiddle is pretty much the same than pasting it on the pastebin
[11:39:00] <duch_kazatel> not if you add html to make it function.
[11:39:05] <duch_kazatel> but whatever duder.  your time.
[11:42:03] <thomasgriffin> Can you variable method names in jQuery?
[11:47:11] <BillCriswell> Same as you would in JS.
[11:47:17] <BillCriswell> Oh, left.
[11:47:20] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[11:47:44] <WeiJunLi> duch_kazatel: here it go http://jsfiddle.net/tU22F/
[11:47:52] <WeiJunLi> click on the first image it appears on the green box
[11:48:01] <WeiJunLi> and the next 6 images need to appear on the red box
[11:49:08] <duch_kazatel> what's with the var e = window.event; ?
[11:50:32] <WeiJunLi> duch_kazatel: just try, i put it in the jsfiddle as you told
[11:51:07] <duch_kazatel> why do you have that there?
[11:51:51] <WeiJunLi> for know what is the element clicked on
[11:52:14] <duch_kazatel> that's totally unnecessary.
[11:52:21] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[11:52:31] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/tU22F/1/
[11:52:33] <duch_kazatel> check that out.
[11:52:46] <duch_kazatel> also, $(this).prop('src', "imgnext" + i); is still your problem.
[11:53:14] <duch_kazatel> that's setting the image source to a string that has nothing to do with what you want.
[11:54:09] <the8thbit|work> Why doesn't this change the html of every element with the .search_main_table_head_cell class to the contents of its title data attribute?: $j(".search_main_table_head_cell").html($j(this).data("title"));
[11:54:46] <WeiJunLi> yes duch_kazatel: i told the problem was on there can you fix it?
[11:56:06] <duch_kazatel> WeiJunLi ...
[11:56:16] <duch_kazatel> yeah i can, trying to help you understand how to do it.
[11:56:31] <duch_kazatel> but here you go http://jsfiddle.net/tU22F/3/
[11:56:42] <duch_kazatel> i'd rethink your strategy, but meh.
[11:57:09] <WeiJunLi> thank you
[11:57:11] <WeiJunLi> but
[11:57:12] <duch_kazatel> the8thbit|work because .html() doesn't enumerate for you.
[11:57:17] <WeiJunLi> thats why you need a jsfiddle
[11:57:23] <WeiJunLi> for change the i to [i]
[11:57:23] <duch_kazatel> WeiJunLi huh?
[11:57:28] <WeiJunLi> lol
[11:57:41] <the8thbit|work> duch_kazatel: What does that mean?
[11:57:41] <duch_kazatel> that's not all I did.
[11:57:58] <duch_kazatel> the8thbit|work .html() doesn't run through each $j(".search_main_table_head_cell") automatically.
[11:58:06] <duch_kazatel> WeiJunLi try reading the code a little more.
[11:58:28] <WeiJunLi> i know what you did, create a empty list and make the code cleaner
[11:58:34] <WeiJunLi> but the empty list and [i]
[11:58:39] <WeiJunLi> is what made the difference
[11:58:41] <WeiJunLi> thanks ;9
[11:58:42] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/tU22F/4/
[11:58:46] <duch_kazatel> *array
[11:58:54] <duch_kazatel> this is slightly cleaner, but still not very good.
[11:58:55] <the8thbit|work> duch_kazatel: So it only does the first one, or something?
[11:59:00] <duch_kazatel> the8thbit|work correct.
[11:59:21] <WeiJunLi> duch_kazatel: what is the solution for all those next()?
[11:59:25] <the8thbit|work> duch_kazatel: How do I convince it to do all of them? Is there a way to loop through a selector like that?
[12:00:03] <duch_kazatel> $j(".search_main_table_head_cell").each($(this).html($j(this).data("title"))); <- something like thhis, the8thbit|work
[12:00:18] <the8thbit|work> duch_kazatel: thanks!
[12:03:32] <the8thbit|work> duch_kazatel: that gives me TypeError: t.call is not a function
[12:03:58] <duch_kazatel> the8thbit|work woops forgot a function in there.
[12:04:02] <the8thbit|work> nevermind, I think I have to provide a function
[12:04:03] <the8thbit|work> yeah
[12:04:05] <the8thbit|work> :)
[12:05:09] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/64WrN/
[12:11:11] <WeiJunLi> duch_kazatel: what if i want to click on the images on the right and change it to the green box?
[12:11:52] <duch_kazatel> WeiJunLi then you want to create an array to read data from instead.
[12:13:04] <WeiJunLi> I am not js coder dont understand how to work it well, can you play a bit on the jsfiddle? and also you didnt tell me any solution to all these next()
[12:15:06] <duch_kazatel> the solution to all the "nexts" is to create an array with your data instead.
[12:15:12] <duch_kazatel> i'm not going to do that for you.
[12:15:23] <duch_kazatel> you're welcome to read about arrays and learn that part yourself, though.
[12:16:03] <duch_kazatel> or you can use an object with keys named for each image and do your magic that way.
[12:17:18] <duch_kazatel> but that object/array will be the key to the rest of what you want.
[12:17:37] <peterR``> so, I have a set of buttons for an onscreen keyboard, I press J. I then want to create another set of buttons on another part of the screen with all the names that start with a J
[12:17:57] <duch_kazatel> all the names of what?
[12:18:05] <peterR``> lol... hang on
[12:18:09] <duch_kazatel> :)
[12:18:19] <peterR``> so supposing you are trying to enter a male name
[12:18:42] <peterR``> you press J and the buttons produced are James, Jason, John etc.
[12:18:52] <duch_kazatel> you want to filter your data to only the names that start with j and render those out as buttons?
[12:18:59] <frank_o> You guys prefer to set global variables as `$.globalVar = new Object(); $.globalVar.someVar = XXX` or `var GLOBAL_VAR = { someVar: XXX }`?
[12:18:59] <peterR``> exactly
[12:19:13] <duch_kazatel> frank_o neither.
[12:19:21] <frank_o> Neither?!
[12:19:29] <peterR``> so I start with a JSON array of names right?
[12:19:31] <duch_kazatel> frank_o globals aren't a very good idea.
[12:19:35] <frank_o> :confused:
[12:20:06] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: But they're ok if you need to share functions across different files right?
[12:20:07] <duch_kazatel> peterR`` totally depend.s  the filtering and data part would be better served by a backend.
[12:20:27] <peterR``> on the server you mean?
[12:20:32] <duch_kazatel> peterR`` correct.
[12:21:03] <duch_kazatel> frank_o if you need to have globally available functions, try to attach them to a globally available object - var myGLobalObject = { thisIsAFunction: function() {}}
[12:21:07] <peterR``> then what approach do I use for communicating with the server? xmlhttprequest?
[12:21:18] <duch_kazatel> peterR`` if you have jquery, just use .ajax()
[12:21:28] <duch_kazatel> or .get(), depending on you needs.
[12:22:02] <peterR``> what do I have to set up on the server?
[12:22:21] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: Hey, that looks hot
[12:22:33] <duch_kazatel> peterR`` some kind of search backend.  there are lots of choices.  Not really sure what your best bet might be since that's not my forte.
[12:22:52] <peterR``> I can arrange for the server to send the entire file of names, but that's not what you mean is it?
[12:22:55] <duch_kazatel> frank_o don't attach to the jquery object, and don't use new if you can avoid it (you can in this case)
[12:23:04] <duch_kazatel> peterR`` no.
[12:23:14] <duch_kazatel> peterR`` you need some kind of search facility.
[12:23:16] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: Wish they'd mention this at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3352020/jquery-the-best-way-to-set-a-global-variable
[12:23:33] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: You know of any decent tuts explaining this?
[12:23:56] <duch_kazatel> frank_o explaining what?
[12:24:12] <duch_kazatel> oh, scope.
[12:24:13] <peterR``> there are 4000 names or so and that number will never change - is it so bad to just have them in a JSON array?
[12:24:57] <duch_kazatel> peterR`` i'd still delegate that to a backend.  otherwise you'll need to find a library that'll do search against that array for you.
[12:25:12] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: yeah
[12:25:21] <peterR``> jquery provides no such thing?
[12:26:11] <duch_kazatel> peterR`` don't need jquery to search through an array.
[12:26:35] <duch_kazatel> you have https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
[12:27:00] <duch_kazatel> err, wrong method.
[12:27:11] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
[12:27:12] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[12:28:05] <duch_kazatel> frank_o you basically just need to read about the basics of scope.  long story short, any var declared within a function is scoped to that function AND all child functions.
[12:28:34] <duch_kazatel> if you omit the var keyword in front of it, it'll be global, but that's bad practice.  you should just declare it before your functions.
[12:29:24] <peterR``> duch_kazatel, it's built in or do I need a lib?
[12:29:38] <duch_kazatel> peterR`` .filter()?
[12:29:43] <peterR``> yes
[12:29:48] <duch_kazatel> frank_o you can also make it global by attaching it to the window object - all "global" vars are actually properties on that object.
[12:30:34] <duch_kazatel> peterR`` that's built-in...
[12:30:44] <duch_kazatel> no support for IE8.
[12:30:47] <duch_kazatel> ie9 and above.
[12:31:06] <duch_kazatel> if it's on MDN, you probably don't need a lib...
[12:31:42] <systemfault> If you need to support IE8, just add es5-shim to your project.
[12:31:59] <peterR``> duch_kazatel, this is running on a kiosk system - I get to choose the browser :)
[12:32:09] <duch_kazatel> or use the the supplied polyfill.
[12:32:52] <duch_kazatel> then you should be fine.
[12:32:56] <duch_kazatel> i'd get familiar with MDN.
[12:33:37] <duch_kazatel> lunchtime. wonder wtf i should get.
[13:11:25] <jimi_> in a selector, how can i say input type !=hidden or elements w/ a certain class?
[13:12:10] <jimi_> input[type!=hidden || class!=foo]
[13:14:06] <systemfault> Hmm,  'input:not([type="hidden"]), input:not(.foo)' perhaps... not sure
[13:14:23] <BillCriswell> jimi_: I'd use filter.
[13:14:26] <djQuery_> jimi_ http://api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/
[13:15:05] <jimi_> ty
[13:15:18] <djQuery_> jimi_, or http://api.jquery.com/add/
[13:15:21] <BillCriswell> input:not([type=hidden].foo) wonder if that would work? Doesn't feel right.
[13:15:27] <BillCriswell> Oh duh
[13:15:38] <BillCriswell> input:not([type=hidden],.foo) hmm?
[13:16:04] <BillCriswell> Puttin them selectors to work.
[13:16:09] <BillCriswell> Get that shit.
[13:16:10] <jimi_> jeje
[13:16:26] <jimi_> ah this works as well $('input[type!="hidden"]').not(".startstoptime").val('');
[13:16:46] <djQuery_> jimi_, thats also probably faster
[13:17:04] <jimi_> ty guys for pointing me there
[13:17:05] <BillCriswell> I still like filter.
[13:18:21] <BillCriswell> $('input').filter(function(){ var $this = $(this); return $this.prop('type') != 'hidden' || !$this.hasClass('startstoptime'); });
[13:19:22] <BillCriswell> Man, so much frustration comes from different browser chrome.
[13:25:12] <adv_> how can i replace this.$('image-nav-left'), with gallery2 (instead of this)?
[13:32:18] <dorgan> if i am looping through a list of elements is it possible to wrap each one in an li tag?
[13:36:26] <BillCriswell> dorgan: Yes, $(this).wrap('<li>')
[14:14:45] <phelix> I have jquery auto filling input items on a form. When I submit that form the values are not showing up. Any idea what may be going on?
[14:15:16] <duch_kazatel> how are you auto filling the fields?
[14:17:42] <phelix> $('.total-cost').val("$"+totalCost); <--- like so
[14:18:22] <phelix> ahh nvm. I see what is going on
[14:18:55] <peterR``> how can a JS function return an unnamed function? I think I got the syntax a bit wrong
[15:02:42] <uskerine> I have a  success: function(msg){  }    inside a function
[15:03:04] <uskerine> I would like to .show one modal window or another one depending on who calls this fucntion
[15:03:12] <uskerine> how could that be achieved?
[15:04:11] <Ownix> Is there a reason my success method isnt being called?
[15:04:13] <Ownix> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/xoBydZpz
[15:04:21] <AnTi_MTtr> hello every, i have a jquery waypoints problem, its working great if i just load the page, but if i click a header and load additional content into the page with javascript, the waypoints stay in its original position
[15:04:26] <AnTi_MTtr> how can you reset the waypoints position
[15:04:30] <AnTi_MTtr> or updated it
[15:05:23] <duch_kazatel> uskerine you'll have to pass that as another argument.
[15:05:50] <duch_kazatel> Ownix  securityRow.data("securityId"), <- this returning what you think it is?
[15:06:22] <uskerine> ok
[15:06:38] <uskerine> I was trying to return true if success
[15:06:50] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:07:01] <uskerine> and handle the .show in the calling function
[15:07:03] <duch_kazatel> btw use .done() instead.
[15:07:10] <uskerine> where?
[15:07:15] <uskerine> where should .done be used
[15:07:15] <uskerine> ?
[15:07:18] <duch_kazatel> $.ajax().done()
[15:07:27] <duch_kazatel> you chain it onto $.ajax9)
[15:07:33] <duch_kazatel> or the object it returns.
[15:07:41] <uskerine> I did not know about it
[15:07:48] <duch_kazatel> what version of jquery are you using?>
[15:07:54] <uskerine> what is wrong with success anyway? I foun it easy to understand
[15:08:05] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: its failing because "message: "Unexpected end of input""
[15:08:10] <uskerine> 1.10.1
[15:08:13] <Ownix> Status returned is 200 OK
[15:08:41] <Ownix> Well fiddler says it is, jquery ajax says its "parsererror" for the textStatus object
[15:09:01] <duch_kazatel> Ownix mind copy/pasting the returned data?
[15:09:05] <AnTi_MTtr> found it $.waypoints('refresh');
[15:09:23] <duch_kazatel> uskerine then yeah, you need to use .done().  success, error, and complete are all deprecated
[15:09:33] <uskerine> good to know
[15:09:40] <uskerine> I will have a look into .done
[15:09:46] <duch_kazatel> you want jqXHR.done(), jqXHR.fail(), and jqXHR.always() instead.
[15:09:54] <duch_kazatel> check out the api docs for $.ajax() for more info.
[15:10:10] <uskerine> ok
[15:10:57] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: http://pastie.org/private/8zso3w0rehtws7uzywota
[15:12:43] <duch_kazatel> Ownix could you get the raw data from the request via your network panel instead?
[15:13:32] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: in my ASP.NET WebAPI controller when I return Ok() with nothing, it throws that, but if I return the data I was sent with return Ok(deletedRecordFromDatabase); it works
[15:13:54] <duch_kazatel> Ownix so you're returning no data?
[15:14:30] <duch_kazatel> try returning a boolean or something else.
[15:14:59] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: raw response for failing call:
[15:15:02] <Ownix> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/YRLekZrm
[15:15:47] <Ownix> Maybe a DELETE call to the server expects some data back?
[15:17:04] <duch_kazatel> you enabled them in IIS, yeah?
[15:17:04] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: No I meant that when I return data it works, but if I return HTTP 200 OK it fails
[15:17:10] <Ownix> Enabled what?
[15:17:23] <Ownix> Oh... I think they are enabled by default. Like I said, its working when I return something.
[15:18:20] <duch_kazatel> if i remember right IIS is weird about some verbs if you don't explicitly enable them.  either way, I'm interested what's in the "response" tab.
[15:19:42] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: I deleted dataType and it works when I return Ok() with nothing in it
[15:19:50] <duch_kazatel> dataType or Type?
[15:19:58] <Ownix> It was expecting JSON back because I told it to expect it back, yet I was returning nothing
[15:20:00] <Ownix> dataType
[15:20:05] <duch_kazatel> there we go, that'd do it.
[15:20:13] <duch_kazatel> that's why I asked what was in the "response" tab under "netwoprk"
[15:20:19] <duch_kazatel> but it looks like you figured it out.
[15:20:39] <Ownix> Oh on my web browser
[15:20:42] <Ownix> Not in fiddler
[15:20:50] <Ownix> Sorry I didnt know what you were asking
[15:20:59] <Ownix> Okay its time to go home for the day
[15:21:01] <Ownix> Thanks for the help duch_kazatel
[15:21:04] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[15:21:05] <duch_kazatel> enjoy.
[15:22:27] <EminenceHC> I am using $(this).closest('div').find('input').val('22'); to try and change a value of the closest input field. It is filling the value as expected but it is filling all input fields instead of the closest one.
[15:23:03] <EminenceHC> I suspect it is because multiple buttons have the same class and even though I click on one button it may be thinking to run the calculation on the nearest div for every button.
[15:23:15] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC right - you're finding the first div ancestor and then finding all input children.
[15:23:55] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: How can I have it find the closest one to the button clicked, not all the buttons with the same class?
[15:25:19] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Ah I see it is finding the closest div ANSCESTOR I thought it was looking for the closest div to the button.
[15:26:49] <ZZRMike> Can you bind "ready" inside of a .js file that's included? or does it have to be in the document itself?
[15:27:04] <duch_kazatel> ZZRMike it can be in a JS file.
[15:27:07] <duch_kazatel> in fact, that's pretty common.
[15:27:31] <ZZRMike> I figured that was the case, back to #magento for me then.
[15:27:35] <ZZRMike> Thanks
[15:28:05] <duch_kazatel> ZZRMike that's a strange question.
[15:30:10] <ZZRMike> I just moved some JS I had out into an external file to try and fit the *magento* file structure better. And I got it to load the file but for some reason document.ready isn't being triggered, I just wanted to make sure it wasn't because I had .ready() in the external file.
[15:34:25] <duch_kazatel> sounds like invalid html/.
[15:42:50] <peterR``> can you use .html() to set the content of a div?
[15:45:55] <duch_kazatel> peterR`` yes
[16:11:45] <WFQ> Hi guys
[16:12:11] <WFQ> is it possible to use jquery validation on onchage evens? I just can see onblur, onfocusin, etc... but not onchange
[16:12:51] <duch_kazatel> WFQ have an example of the others?
[16:13:27] <WFQ> no by default is onkeyup so I have not changed anything
[16:14:29] <duch_kazatel> you can change the binding yourself, was wondering what you'd tried.
[16:15:35] <WFQ> sorry how do you mean? I am using addMethod to create my own custom rules. Do you mean binding the elements to an onchange event out of the validation?
[16:15:51] <peterR``> can you make a table of a certain height so that it fits vertically into the enclosing div?
[16:16:10] <peterR``> i.e. you have a div of 30% of the screen
[16:16:33] <peterR``> then your table will have 10 rows, if 60% of the screen then 20rows etc.
[16:16:52] <duch_kazatel> WFQ http://jqueryvalidation.org/validate/
[16:17:22] <juboba> hey, I want to wrap $.post() in a function and return true or false depending on the result of the post function. I know this is async, but I would like to wait and return when the post() function has ended.
[16:17:26] <WFQ> onchange does not appear there as event
[16:18:00] <duch_kazatel> WFQ right - you have to disable it's default behavior and instead fire .valid() yourself.
[16:21:07] <WFQ> I don't htink that is necessary
[16:22:05] <WFQ> jquery validation looks for a any error label in order to submit the form I can guess. Perhaps one can bind an element of the form to the onchange event and remove the error label element
[16:22:36] <WFQ> have tried this but I think itis wrong http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3692245/jquery-validate-how-can-i-make-a-field-validate-on-change
[16:22:41] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:22:58] <duch_kazatel> "No you're wrong there's got to be another way.  Here's an example, but it doesn't work."
[16:23:00] <uskerine> in bootstrap, while using modals, does anyone know how to detect when the user dismiss the modal with ESC?
[16:23:30] <duch_kazatel> WFQ you either roll with what they have, or you have to go through a bunch of pain.
[16:23:36] <duch_kazatel> don't munge a solution together.
[16:23:54] <WFQ> sure
[16:24:08] <WFQ> trying to avoid but can't believe this is not possible to be done
[16:24:19] <duch_kazatel> it IS possible - I just told you how.
[16:26:05] <WFQ> how? Do you mean by getting read of jquery validation altogheter and use my on validation rules only?
[16:26:46] <duch_kazatel> no.
[16:27:01] <duch_kazatel> by deactivating all of the events it binds and then run .valid() yourself.
[16:28:06] <WFQ> don't know what you mean. Never mind. No worries. I shall leave it as such
[16:28:09] <WFQ> thank you
[16:30:01] <duch_kazatel> dude.  take every "on*" option and set it to false to disable it. onsubmit, onfocusout, onkeyup, onclick
[16:30:05] <duch_kazatel> set those to false
[16:30:22] <duch_kazatel> then create a change event handler yourself and run vali() against the form yourself.

[16:45:11] <peterR``> does JS have a builtin JSON parser?
[16:45:33] <duch_kazatel> peterR`` https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse
[16:45:36] <duch_kazatel> if it's text.
[16:45:40] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, just use the object.
[16:46:34] <peterR``> I will get json text from a server
[16:48:40] <duch_kazatel> then JSON.parse()
[16:49:24] <uskerine> Does anyone know how to "harcode" a value in datables.net plugin? I want to retrieve values with AJAX -already doing that- but for the last code i would like to hardcode HTML text.
[16:49:29] <uskerine> hardcode*
[16:49:40] <uskerine> code=column
[16:59:42] <EminenceHC> I am finding the sum of all fields with a certain class. What is the best way to throw out NaN values in the calculation? https://gist.github.com/EminenceHC/c11075ac49b6564bc9ed
[17:00:33] <duch_kazatel> test parseFloat(this.value); for NaN
[17:02:43] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: I am not sure where to implement that.
[17:04:34] <duch_kazatel> check if isNaN()
[17:04:38] <duch_kazatel> if so, don't do that add.
[17:05:53] <duch_kazatel> http://fixee.org/paste/15q5pmy/#8378
[17:05:57] <duch_kazatel> simple stuff...
[17:06:02] <duch_kazatel> actually.
[17:06:16] <duch_kazatel> http://fixee.org/paste/15q5pmy/#8378=&url=tudwcl2
[17:06:33] <duch_kazatel> forgot the negate/.
[17:17:29] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Thanks makes sense to me now. I was having trouble understanding the syntax.
[17:17:35] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[17:56:53] <uskerine> in JS/JQuery, is it possible to break a string among different lines?
[17:56:59] <uskerine> (a very long string)
[18:00:28] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[18:01:15] <uskerine> I realized it, ' ......'+
[18:01:19] <uskerine> ' .......'+
[18:01:21] <uskerine> and so on
[18:29:09] <KingThor> would anyone be able to tip me off on best practice for achieving error-free page load using the bxslider plugin?
[18:31:02] <KingThor> everything is working, just wondering why it doesn't load properly when dumping the cache
[18:31:40] <KingThor> page in question: http://www.hudsonvalleycompass.com/scoops
[18:34:58] <BillCriswell> Can any of you recall a site that basically allowed you to generate like a bunch of random triangles that look pretty? Can't think of what it's called.
[18:35:53] <snover> sierpinski triangle?
[18:36:26] <BillCriswell> snover: Not that. It was more 3d.
[18:37:31] <BillCriswell> Blah, can't think of the name.
[18:39:51] <BillCriswell> snover: http://i.imgur.com/tvvsLgN.png like this
[18:42:53] <And1> BillCriswell: FlatSurfaceShader
[18:43:39] <BillCriswell> And1: This is it. Thanks.
[18:43:43] <And1> BillCriswell: http://matthew.wagerfield.com/flat-surface-shader/
[18:43:48] <And1> : )
[18:44:34] <BillCriswell> And1: Nice. Just what I needed.
[19:29:55] <KingThor> is there a best practice for firing jquery at the right time for optimal user experience?
[20:32:25] <acidjazz> ok i got a good one, i have an array of scripts i want to load w/ load(), but load() returns a callback when its done loading a script.  i dont want my next script .load()'ing until the previous one has loaded
[22:19:59] <rahuldroy_work> hey guys, does anyone know how I can me the text in an li so that it is only one line? I am currently using $("#sadf").text($("#sadf").text().substr(0,25)+'...');
[22:20:29] <rahuldroy_work> If if doesn't fit in one line, then I want the rest of the string replaced with "..."
[22:21:36] <iArivu> rahuldroy_work you can set the width
[22:21:54] <iArivu> and check for the character length
[22:22:28] <iArivu> if its excides append '...'
[22:42:02] <el_inventor> ¡hi!  o/
[22:42:26] <el_inventor> good night
[22:43:10] <el_inventor> i need help with something
[22:43:16] <el_inventor> How I can kill a function in jquery?
[22:44:26] <sacho_> you can't kill a function.
[22:46:23] <rahuldroy_work> el_inventor: If you are desperate, you can always return
[22:46:54] <el_inventor> return false?
[22:47:13] <el_inventor> on the click event?
[22:47:37] <sacho_> click event?
[22:47:43] <rahuldroy_work> iArivu: yeah thought of that. I was hoping for a oneliner
[22:48:21] <rahuldroy_work> el_inventor: you can have a function expression on click events and yes you can return false...
[22:52:16] <el_inventor> rahuldroy_work: see, I'm calling a function that loads data into a main page with buttons that are pressed
[22:53:18] <el_inventor> rahuldroy_work: but, when I stepped on several times those buttons and think of a lag starts to behave strange
[22:54:36] <el_inventor> cuando revisé con firebug dice "too much recursion"
[22:55:52] <el_inventor> rahuldroy_work: I think when you call the function multiple times in a row creates a loop
[22:56:25] <el_inventor> rahuldroy_work: that's what I think, do not really know
[23:06:55] <el_inventor> :(
[23:11:07] <Cork> rahuldroy_work: why not just use the css eclipse property?
[23:12:36] <el_inventor> ¿how?
[23:13:52] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/vmG9s/
[23:21:15] <rahuldroy_work> Cork: I didn't now that existed. THANKS!!!
[23:21:38] <Cork> rahuldroy_work: note, it isn't supported in older ies
[23:22:06] <Cork> heh...
[23:22:11] <Cork> or actually it is XD
[23:22:23] <Cork> heh ie 6.0...
[23:22:26] <Cork> damn :)
[23:22:32] <rahuldroy_work> Cork: they are too old  me to care
[23:22:43] <rahuldroy_work> Cork: just want IE to die grrr
[23:22:54] <Cork> rahuldroy_work: i'm ok with ie10+
[23:23:03] <Cork> but ya, the older ones are not fun
[23:23:34] <rahuldroy_work> Cork: kinda use linux as my main OS, so no IE for me YAY
[23:23:44] <Cork> rahuldroy_work: same here
[23:23:50] <Cork> though i have vms for most of them
[23:24:45] <rahuldroy_work> i am actually a php dev so i just leave this nasty stuff to the front end guys
[23:25:58] <rahuldroy_work> el_inventor: I am really finding it hard to picture what you are doing. Can you do a simple mockup on jsfiddle
