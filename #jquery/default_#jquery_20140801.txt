[00:19:56] <Lurzino> hello everyone! :)
[00:21:34] <Lurzino> on this jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/4NgxB/1/ I have a simple table with some stuffs... on loaded page with this code $('#mytable tbody tr td:nth-child(3)').hide(); it should hide third column so I can show it later on execution... why it didn't hide? Maybe nth-child() works only on certain tables? Thanks to all :-)
[00:23:21] <K4T> http://pastebin.com/H74VGedt how I can add $avatarImg to bootboxBody string (line 11)?
[00:23:47] <Uhkis> Lurzino: http://jsfiddle.net/4NgxB/6/ added jquery, fixed syntax error
[00:23:48] <K4T> $avatarImg is jQuery object, I can not use html() on it to change it to html string cause I will get empty string
[00:27:22] <blubberbop> I have a form where with just enter, it submits. Now I added the jquery-ui datepicker from http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/ and all of the sudden, enter no longer submits the form. What causes this?
[00:27:37] <Lurzino> ah Uhkis , thats true... I forgot the ) thing! thanks!!!! :-)
[00:29:25] <PatBateman> hi
[00:29:30] <PatBateman> anyone using redactor js ?
[00:30:44] <Uhkis> K4T: try $avatarImg.prop('outerHTML');
[00:31:40] <K4T> Uhkis: thank you! but is it compatbile with all browsers?
[00:31:50] <Uhkis> K4T: not sure
[00:34:02] <Uhkis> K4T: if it works internally like https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/element.outerHTML it should be really well supported
[00:35:07] <jak2000> Uhkis know a plugin for add rows, delete rows, edit... ?
[00:35:58] <Uhkis> jak2000: http://www.jtable.org/
[00:36:22] <K4T> Uhkis: looks like older FF can have problems with it
[00:36:32] <uskerine> you also have datatables.net
[00:36:42] <K4T> can not find good source of outerHTML browsers compatibility
[00:37:31] <Uhkis> K4T: mozdev says since version 11
[00:37:36] <Uhkis> that's really old
[00:37:53] <jak2000> Uhkis interesting
[00:37:54] <jak2000> thanks
[00:38:07] <K4T> thank you
[00:38:38] <Uhkis> "Firefox 11 shipped on March 13, 2012"
[00:41:10] <d3m0n> Hey guys, what would be a good way to prevent the animation from animating past the max amount of slides? http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/KeuEF
[00:42:09] <d3m0n> eg: by default it shouldn't animate when previous link pressed and same for when you get to the end of the list when hitting next.
[00:47:34] <uskerine> can I include a jquery file inside other? -sort kind of #include-
[00:48:52] <davidyezsetz> uskerine to what end? If you want to combine files I recommend looking in to task runners that concatenate files
[00:49:18] <Jattenalle> uskerine, .js files? yes
[00:49:45] <uskerine> I would like to try to separte code a bit more
[00:49:47] <Jattenalle> uskerine, http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getscript/
[00:50:11] <uskerine> I have a page, say main.js with lots of stuff under $(document).ready
[00:50:23] <uskerine> and I was wondering if I could refer, inside that, another .js
[00:50:37] <Jattenalle> uskerine, http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getscript/
[00:50:47] <Jattenalle> uskerine, or just add the other .js inside your html file
[00:50:52] <uskerine> does it have any shortcome?
[00:51:01] <uskerine> like things do not execute when I expect?
[00:51:14] <Jattenalle> getScript? several
[00:51:25] <Jattenalle> including the other .js in your .html is the easier way
[00:51:29] <Jattenalle> also more straightforward
[00:51:48] <uskerine> I see
[00:51:59] <uskerine> but if code has to be executed inside $(document). ready
[00:52:10] <uskerine> cna I have two .js with that?
[00:52:13] <Jattenalle> wrap it in a function that you call Initialize, or something
[00:52:17] <Uhkis> d3m0n: count the amount of boxes, on click increment a value and if it hits shown+value, dont animate
[00:52:24] <Jattenalle> put that in your init.js and include that, call it from your document ready
[00:52:34] <uskerine> I understand
[00:52:35] <uskerine> ok
[00:52:48] <Jattenalle> uskerine, you can, but it's better to have a single one and use functions.. makes for cleaner code
[00:53:06] <Jattenalle> so put the document ready in your html file, but have all your js in your .js files, call with functions
[00:53:10] <d3m0n> Uhkis: I did that but a problem comes up if 1.) You hit next and then previous? 2.) You can still hit previous on initial load.
[00:54:54] <Uhkis> d3m0n: obviously you use the same counter for prev too
[00:55:57] <Uhkis> d3m0n: and if it's 0 you dont animate (solves both 1&2)
[00:58:14] <d3m0n> I am sorry I don't follow you.
[00:58:56] <d3m0n> Say, if I have a var at 0 and you cannot animation previous with 0... I hit next that incriments to, 1, I hit prev it increments to 2... and can go past it
[01:03:02] <Uhkis> d3m0n: how to update that codepen paste
[01:03:17] <d3m0n> fork should work
[01:03:33] <Uhkis> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/HinJB
[01:04:23] <mikunos> Hi guys, I am trying to create a simple Drag and Drop between a list and a fancytree object in this way: http://i5.minus.com/iP0W3Jhv4SwPQ.png but I don't understand how to set the list in order to move the items to the treeview node.
[01:05:04] <d3m0n> Ahh ok Uhkis, I thought you meant keep adding onto the variable even with previous.
[01:05:07] <d3m0n> Thank you very much
[01:06:12] <mikunos> any idea?
[01:20:27] <K4T> https://gist.github.com/K4T/5889d8f7ca03c22f9726#file-bootstrap-picker-js-L376 can someone tell me how I can override "dates" array without modifying plugin code? Is it possible?
[01:21:05] <K4T> I would like to translate them
[01:28:07] <Uhkis> http://bootstrap-datepicker.readthedocs.org/en/latest/i18n.html
[01:34:02] <K4T> unfortunately this is not the plugin that we use. We are using: http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker
[01:34:14] <K4T> a there is no documetned feature which allow translate dates
[01:34:34] <K4T> I also dont want to change plugin (too much work)
[01:46:11] <zitter> Is it possible to fire an event onCLick for node that *hasn't* class="foo"?
[01:48:30] <Uhkis> zitter: $(':not(.foo)')
[01:59:06] <Lindrain> I have a bunch of elements with some data-foo="" attributes. Is it possible to get all elements with those attributes, and group them based on those attributes?
[02:00:41] <Peacegrove> $('[data-foo]')
[02:03:22] <Lindrain> Peacegrove: right, but i want to group the result based on their values, too.
[02:08:02] <Lindrain> Peacegrove: perhaps better, only select those data-foo where two or more elements have the same value?
[02:16:36] <Peacegrove> Maybe like this? https://gist.github.com/Peacegrove/32318525f64840180de6
[02:52:32] <DansVC> hi everyone :D
[03:51:03] <Qantourisc> Is there a better way to write var jqxhr=$.get(); var jqhr_b=jqxhr.then(); jqhr_b.abort=jqxhr.abort; return jqxhr; ?
[03:51:14] <Qantourisc> The goal is to get a deferred object that is abortable
[04:01:14] <Repox> Hello. I have some div elements with a rel attribute containing 'answers'. Like so: <div class="row" rel="answers"> content </div> - Now, I'm trying to append a new element by doing the following, but it doesn't work. $( "div:last[rel=answers]" ).append( data.message );
[04:03:24] <Uhkis> Repox: $('div[rel=answers').last()
[04:03:41] <Uhkis> and fix that missing ] too
[04:05:03] <Repox> Uhkis, thank you for your help.
[04:09:25] <VectorX> i have a href="#"  <a> which has a js click action, when i click it the url gets the # how can i make it so it doesnt do that ?
[04:10:12] <Peacegrove> VectorX e.preventDefault()
[04:12:54] <VectorX> Peacegrove thanks that did it
[04:26:27] <VectorX> i need to insert some html to a div id #result, after 1 second how do i do that
[04:34:14] <VectorX> im guessing i can use delay but how do i specify the function
[04:34:21] <VectorX> i dont want any effects
[04:37:32] <pyemkey> anyone build kind of instant search? I am trying to use for that typeahead script. For example I am typing part of word and can see autocompletion and result on page. I would like to get something like on this page http://blog.comperiosearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/instantsearch.html I am using rails + jquery + ajax but either jquery or ajax are my weakness.

[04:45:09] <GingerGeek> OK thank you
[04:49:21] <FernandoBasso> I'm using jquery 1.6. How to detect if the current input field is the last one? is(':last') only works in 1.7 and above.
[04:50:29] <FernandoBasso> It is a legacy system and if I change to a newer version bad things will happen, also, it is a messy and ugly system.
[04:53:23] <FernandoBasso> It seems if ($(this).is(':last-child')) should work...
[04:53:28] <decx> $('div').eq(-1)
[04:54:37] <decx> !$(this).next().length
[04:55:16] <FernandoBasso> $(this).eq(-1) didn't work. Just as my previous example.
[04:55:37] <decx> well of course it doesnt work with this
[04:55:47] <decx> think about that for a second ;)
[04:56:01] <FernandoBasso> http://pastebin.com/2H7xxRwi
[04:56:05] <decx> this is one thing, eq is for ocllections
[04:56:23] <decx> use the next length thing
[04:57:08] <FernandoBasso> I know why it is not working... (besides what i just pointed out.
[04:57:21] <FernandoBasso> The structure is <tr><td><input...
[04:57:35] <FernandoBasso> Oh, no, because I'm matching with a class.
[04:57:43] <decx> is() is 1.7
[04:57:59] <FernandoBasso> Strangely enough I don't get an error.
[04:58:21] <FernandoBasso> jQuery.fn.jquery; --> "1.6.4"
[04:58:39] <decx> well it's gonna be false in a conditional
[04:58:50] <decx> use the next length thing
[04:58:52] <FernandoBasso> Indeed.
[04:59:38] <MikeD_> does the next length thing return how many items remain when 'this' is the first one in a collection?
[04:59:56] <decx> no
[05:00:04] <decx> nextAll().length would
[05:01:19] <FernandoBasso> decx: I don't get the logic behind $(this).next().length
[05:01:42] <decx> check if there is a nextSibling
[05:02:17] <FernandoBasso> That is the problem. I have <tr><td><input 1> <tr><td><input 2>, and so on.
[05:02:32] <decx> so?
[05:03:13] <FernandoBasso> So, input1 (or 2) is the only child inside <td>. There will never be a sibling.
[05:03:44] <decx> the next logical step isnt that big a leap, common
[05:04:27] <FernandoBasso> $(this).closest('tr').next().length
[05:04:41] <decx> i dont think there's closest in 1.6 but yes
[05:04:43] <decx> there you go
[05:06:12] <FernandoBasso> decx: Thanks for the help, time and patience. It is most appreciated.
[05:19:04] <krambiorix> hi, what's wrong with my code? If all fields in a table row are empty, there should not be an error : http://jsfiddle.net/v8Tey/1/
[05:20:56] <uskerine> hi, can datatables retrieve a set of columns and then generate a new column combining values of previously retrieved ones?
[05:21:01] <uskerine> like I have column ADDRESS and TOWN
[05:21:13] <uskerine> and I would like to merge both into a single column "ADDRESS-TOWN"
[05:21:48] <uuzilla> Hello stuck at infinite scroll plugin
[05:21:50] <decx> krambiorix that happens once at load and works
[05:23:09] <krambiorix> decx, how do you mean?
[05:23:28] <decx> like i wrote it, it's overlay verbose but it works
[05:24:42] <krambiorix> decx, i updated my code: http://jsfiddle.net/v8Tey/2/    -> it should say 'YES'
[05:26:57] <decx> this is ridiculous
[05:28:22] <krambiorix> decx, ?
[05:29:15] <decx> that logic
[05:29:18] <decx> or lack thereof
[05:29:42] <krambiorix> decx ok thanks for the constructive talk
[05:30:03] <MikeD_> i was going to answer "what's wrong with my code" with "it doesn't have comments explaining what you think you're thinking"
[05:30:32] <decx> you use map on a single element that doesnt make sense
[05:30:40] <decx> then you have a filter inside your map
[05:30:44] <decx> and all that is in a conditional
[05:30:48] <decx> it's ridiculouzs
[05:31:16] <decx> i suggest looking into a validator to see what a better approach might be
[05:32:14] <krambiorix> k
[05:32:15] <krambiorix> thx
[05:36:06] <decx> krambiorix most basic implementation: http://jsfiddle.net/decx/v8Tey/3/
[05:37:58] <krambiorix> decx thanks a lot!
[05:44:13] <ChoboBill> Keep getting error saying my second for loop is not pushing any values to "hits" array - http://jsfiddle.net/8m6W3/
[05:47:58] <decx> are you trying to find the positions where the word is hit?
[05:48:03] <decx> or just the count
[05:48:49] <ChoboBill> once the first letter is foud within "text", it should push it to the "hits" array
[05:48:54] <ChoboBill> found*
[05:49:45] <MikeD_> why would you loop character by character through a body of text instead of matching on a regex?
[05:50:07] <ChoboBill> its just a project on codeacademy
[05:50:11] <MikeD_> oh
[05:50:53] <ChoboBill> ah, no worries, found out the issue
[05:51:04] <ChoboBill> text[0] instead of [i]
[05:51:11] <decx> this will find the count and index position http://jsfiddle.net/decx/8m6W3/1/
[06:11:19] <hackal> Hello is this channel also jquery UI related or is there any other channel for UI?
[06:11:45] <decx> yes, it's right there in the topic
[06:13:07] <mooncup> does anyone know of a way to generate funnel charts with flot?
[06:13:12] <mooncup> or do I have to use a plugin?
[06:17:45] <hackal> How does jquery UI datepicker's localization works? I have multilingual wordpress managed by WPML plugin I would like to add datepicker to contact form. Will the datepicker choose its language according to locale or do I have to do it manually?
[06:18:30] <decx> i think it'll use html lang
[06:36:44] <decx> hackal i checked on one of my wpml sites and it doesnt, you have to normalize your html lang code into the datepicker variant and init with a $.datapicker.regional[lang] option
[06:38:02] <hackal> decx: thank you for investigation. Will figure it out somehow.
[06:38:43] <decx> basicly .datepicker( $.datepicker.regional[document.documentElement.lang] );
[06:39:54] <hackal> In this example they are including language files http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#localization is this included in jquery UI download?
[06:40:00] <delboy1978uk1> Uncaught TypeError: Property 'promise' of object #<Object> is not a function. what does that mean?

[07:13:52] <monstordh> oops. sorry

[07:17:28] <monstordh> lol
[07:18:23] <ugolin> hi
[07:18:28] <BillCriswell> I really hope 8 makes drupal a little more sane.
[07:19:07] <ugolin> BillCriswell: that's the plan (they said) and I hope for them as well.
[07:21:10] <yomy> Hi , guys. I have a function that injects some elements in DOM. After that function I have another that uses the elements injected. The problem is that the first function is not done when the second is called. If I use setTimeout to delay it a bit everything works.
[07:21:58] <BillCriswell> yomy: Are you waiting till the elements are inserted before calling it?
[07:21:58] <yomy> I tried deferred and when().then() but no luck
[07:22:12] <systemfault> yomy: DOM manipulations are sync..
[07:22:31] <ugolin> small question :  I have 5 form, each one have an input field. I bind some logic to each input but want to avoid to repeat myself
[07:22:54] <BillCriswell> I imagine it's through AJAX systemfault.
[07:22:57] <systemfault> yomy: So they just work, no need for when/then/setTimeout/etc
[07:23:06] <ugolin> by logic I mean : On Change listening
[07:23:07] <yomy> how can I wait until the first function is finished?
[07:23:14] <BillCriswell> THinking $('.foo').load('some-html.html'); $('.some-html').foo()
[07:23:20] <systemfault> BillCriswell: I wasn’t assuming anything… but you might be right :D
[07:23:26] <ugolin> is it possible to organize taht logic in an each(statement) ?
[07:23:38] <ugolin> *each() statement
[07:24:05] <BillCriswell> ugolin: Depending what you need to do you might not even need the each.
[07:24:11] <BillCriswell> Well, in YOUR code.
[07:25:31] <ugolin> I have 5 times that piece http://pastebin.com/8ig0hBzy
[07:25:39] <BillCriswell> yomy: Can you write up a demo at jsbin or something?
[07:26:14] <BillCriswell> yomy: Should be able to do like $foo.load('some.html').done(function() { $foo.find('.something-from-some-html').addClass('weee'); });
[07:27:37] <ugolin> I am going this way but really that sound bad http://pastebin.com/ny9Z7DgH
[07:27:51] <jak2000> hi all anyone know a plugin for add rows, delete rows, edit... ?
[07:30:46] <yamy> to be more specific I'm doing this: http://jsfiddle.net/ZLgPu/1/
[07:31:22] <yamy> it works fine in the fiddle but in an actual browser it doesn't
[07:33:58] <decx> this should never work
[07:35:33] <yamy> why?
[07:35:54] <decx> a multitude of reasons
[07:37:52] <decx> missing + for string concatation, missing variables, wrong braces, superflous paranthesis, the use of alert, embedding jqui when oyu already embedded jqui
[07:37:57] <yamy> sorry, wrong fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/ZLgPu/2/
[07:39:45] <decx> look at the created code here http://jsfiddle.net/ZLgPu/2/show/ and compare to your version that doesnt work
[07:41:21] <yamy> sorry, I forgot to update the fiddle I posted. The fiddle does work. My question is why it doesn't work in browser but works in fiddle
[07:42:19] <yamy> the actual code is more complicated and it takes longer to execute but the markup is 100% correct
[07:42:27] <decx> i'm not in the mood for primordial support. include scripts the right way and it'll do
[07:42:53] <yamy> ok.Thank you
[07:44:02] <BillCriswell> Is there a simple way to see if all elements in an array are truthy? foo.every(function(bool){ return bool; }); seems a bit much for the job?
[07:44:17] <BillCriswell> foo.filter().length maybe?
[07:45:05] <BillCriswell> Oh this isn't php where filter eliminates false values from an array when nothing is passed to it haha
[07:45:42] <BillCriswell> Ah, indexOf(false);
[07:45:42] <decx> just loop through it?
[07:45:59] <decx> ah true
[07:46:03] <decx> it's false
[07:46:37] <pastry> does not indexOf use identity to search?
[07:46:49] <BillCriswell> pastry: I don't even know what that means. =(
[07:47:50] <systemfault> pastry: It follows the rules of JS… compares by value for primitives, by reference for objects.
[07:48:00] <pastry> BillCriswell: it won't find falsey values, rather exactly `false`
[07:48:13] <pastry> so not zero and not null
[07:48:32] <pastry> and not empty string also
[07:48:34] <BillCriswell> pastry: That's actually what I meant to so haha. If I said falsy I just made a mistake.
[07:53:22] <mdev> what do you use to minify your javascript
[07:53:23] <pastry> BillCriswell: you're forgiven, son, but you shall only speak the truth from now on, and never the truthy
[07:53:45] <pastry> from the third good part of javascript to the disciples
[07:53:51] <BillCriswell> Amen.
[07:54:18] <Tinnit> Good morning; I'm trying to get a custom renderItem working with an autocomplete control that uses a source attribute to retrieve data from a JSON service. I want this renderitem to take elements from each JSON result and format a result to show these elements (specifically, user name and real name, as well as an icon) ... I've been trying for about an hour but I'm out of google results to cross-reference :)
[07:54:23] <BillCriswell> mdev: uglify for the most part I think?
[07:54:23] <systemfault> mdev: I usually have a grunt job with the uglify plugin to do it
[07:54:57] <Tinnit> My current relevant code looks like this; http://pastebin.com/QDRm8aru
[07:55:32] <sarkie> Can someone help me... am I being stupid, but should this fire the event? http://pastebin.com/kL3X4MQs
[07:55:34] <BillCriswell> systemfault: Have you tried browserify?
[07:55:43] <systemfault> BillCriswell: Yes, love it
[07:56:14] <BillCriswell> systemfault: Been playing with it on and off. Would like to use it for a real project sometime ( with watchify ).
[07:56:49] <BillCriswell> sarkie: That would need to be in a document ready I believe.
[07:57:10] <sarkie> BillCriswell: yeah just pulled the relevant code out for the pastbin.
[07:57:10] <BillCriswell> sarkie: It can't be before the </body> since it won't exist yet.
[07:58:11] <BillCriswell> sarkie: http://jsbin.com/henawe/1/edit?html,js,output here it is isolated. Must be another error somewhere.
[07:58:19] <Tinnit> As an aside, what I'm getting from the autocomplete is just a box with blank list entries
[07:58:19] <sarkie> BillCriswell: the handler works if I click it, not from any js code. thought there might be unwritten rule
[07:58:58] <BillCriswell> sarkie: It works in the bin.
[07:59:11] <sarkie> BillCriswell: indeed!
[07:59:12] <sarkie> hmm
[08:02:04] <Tinnit> I've tried using different syntaxes from different versions of JQUI, just in case -- no avail. I'm not sure if it's because I'm using a remote source or what
[08:02:18] <Tinnit> (all the examples I've found have the source data in the JS file)
[08:07:41] <Tinnit_> Grr, stupid corporate network
[08:09:59] <Tinnit_> If anyone had an idea around my issue, I missed it when my network disconnected :(
[08:10:20] <NoiseEee> Tinnit_: well whats the value of data('autocomplete-url')
[08:10:26] <NoiseEee> Tinnit_: does it obey SOP
[08:10:38] <Tinnit_> NoiseEee; It's the correct request URL; I do see the data getting requested and returned
[08:10:38] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy @ Tinnit_
[08:10:49] <Tinnit_> and for what it's worth, when I don't use _renderItem, the data itself is fine
[08:10:58] <Tinnit_> it's just adding the _renderItem hook that causes the display to stop working
[08:11:17] <Tinnit_> (I get the correct number of blank entries in the drop-down for the search, when adding _renderItem :P)
[08:12:53] <NoiseEee> sorry Tinnit_ not that familiar with jqueryUI
[08:13:08] <Tinnit_> np, thanks for looking :)
[08:13:40] <NoiseEee> but arent you supposed to define that elsewhere?
[08:13:56] <Tinnit_> The examples seem to be across the board with where to put _renderItem
[08:14:04] <NoiseEee> ok
[08:14:07] <Tinnit_> Some say "in the create event", some say "against the resultant variable"
[08:14:15] <NoiseEee> i'd try the create event fwiw
[08:14:24] <Tinnit_> Yeah, I tried that too -- same exact result
[08:14:30] <Tinnit_> At least it's consistent? :P
[08:14:57] <duch_kazatel> goood morning #jquery
[08:15:10] <Tinnit_> morning
[08:16:09] <Tinnit_> NoiseEee; The weird(?) thing is that I put a breakpoint in the renderItem function and it's not getting hit. I'm not JS-savvy enough to know if that's correct behavior or not, TBH, but I'd expect anything inside a function(){...} to be hit in a debugger.
[08:16:33] <duch_kazatel> JS certainly is weird
[08:17:57] <Getty> this makes me crazy... the same files everything the same.... but now it doesnt work... i _SEE_ the frames in the debugging console but socket.io.js just doesnt want to trigger the event
[08:21:21] <coderDJ412> Hello everyone
[08:21:44] <duch_kazatel> good morning, coderDJ412
[08:24:38] <coderDJ412> How can I add jquery ui methods to dynamically created dom elements. For example, I have a button that onclick will create a table row with an input I would like to attach the autocomplete method to. I need to attatch multiple rows like this. Is this possible with listening for an onclick event to the button and then addinng the dom elements and script to the page? I can add the elements,...
[08:24:39] <coderDJ412> ...I'm just unsure about adding the script to the page.
[08:25:30] <BillCriswell> coderDJ412: You can use event delegation.
[08:25:40] <duch_kazatel> ^^ this is a smart man
[08:25:57] <coderDJ412> Thanks BillCriswell, I will look into it!
[08:26:06] <duch_kazatel> coderDJ412 check out the docus for .on()
[08:26:18] <BillCriswell> Like... say #container exsits when the page loads, you can do $('#container').on('click', 'button', function () { /* A button was clicked inside container */ }); and it doesn't matter when or how that button was inserted.
[08:27:20] <coderDJ412> BillCriswell: the button will be the only thing on the page. It will trigger the creation of the input element, which needs to have a autocomplete method attached to it.
[08:28:41] <BillCriswell> coderDJ412: I may have misunderstood then. You'd have to initiate that when the button is ready. You can do like $('.foo').load('.date-button.html').done(function(){ $('.date-button').dateThingie(); });
[08:29:25] <hackal> are languages for jquery UI datepicker bundled with download?
[08:29:56] <coderDJ412> BillCriswell: hmm. Let me see if I can explain it better.
[08:30:18] <duch_kazatel> hackal hrm? you mean like localisation?
[08:30:40] <hackal> duch_kazatel: yes
[08:30:45] <decx> hackal i told you earlier, no
[08:31:10] <decx> you need either the separate files or the complete http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1/i18n/jquery-ui-i18n.min.js
[08:32:29] <Tinnit_> Well, I just figured it out
[08:32:48] <Tinnit_> tl;dr version is "I'm an idiot and need more coffee"
[08:33:00] <duch_kazatel> Tinnit_ we're _all_ idiots ;)
[08:33:06] <DansVC> Hi, I'm looking for someone that could give the opinion about my website: http://ray-dee-oh.com :D
[08:33:30] <decx> nothing changed my hatred for it
[08:33:31] <delboy1978uk> anyone seen this before? Uncaught TypeError: Property 'promise' of object #<Object> is not a function
[08:33:44] <coderDJ412> BillCriswell: possible pseudo code  would be:
[08:33:45] <coderDJ412> when button is clicked
[08:33:47] <coderDJ412> create table row and insert input elements
[08:33:48] <coderDJ412> insert $('#element').autocomplete(); where #element is the ID of the input dom element
[08:33:50] <coderDJ412> Does that help?
[08:34:13] <duch_kazatel> DansVC ;) you might have better luck in one of the rooms directed at web design, but my previous assessments all still hold true :)
[08:34:52] <BillCriswell> coderDJ412: Yeah. My answer still stands haha
[08:34:53] <coderDJ412> BillCriswell: i don't want code, just point me where to read and I'm gravy
[08:35:02] <DansVC> yes, I receive some suggests
[08:35:09] <DansVC> from design rooms
[08:35:26] <coderDJ412> BillCriswell, cool. i will check out the methods you've pointed out. Thanks!
[08:35:40] <DansVC> and now I'm talking with users to know what's their opinio :D
[08:36:18] <BillCriswell> I judge "designers" way too prematurely.
[08:36:30] <BillCriswell> I give them all way too much credit from the start haha.
[08:36:43] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell word.  they can be an interesting lot.
[08:36:44] <decx> nice
[08:37:02] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Definitely.
[08:37:06] <duch_kazatel> same with users - they don't know what they actually want, and asking them to articulate that isn't going to get you far.
[08:37:24] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yeah... Steve Jobs was definitely right about that haha.
[08:37:39] <duch_kazatel> one of the few things i ever actually agreed with him on.
[08:37:41] <BillCriswell> I was like "That sounds douchey" then I was like "Fuck you're right"
[08:37:55] <decx> i'm still designer and agree
[08:38:17] <duch_kazatel> decx that's because you're good at your job ;)
[08:38:18] <DansVC> ok duch_kazatel
[08:38:23] <decx> how many times must i sell myself, before my pieces are gone. i'm one of a kind - i'm designer
[08:40:01] <BillCriswell> Same thing with a lot of UX people I come across.
[08:40:29] <BillCriswell> I just... need to set my expectations for people lower till they show me otherwise... not too low but right in the middle.
[08:40:52] <xxx1337> Do you guys work on the majority of your development in chrome or firefox? I like chrome more but I work in firefox because of firebug. What do you guys do?
[08:40:58] <decx> the path too cynicism is set in motion
[08:41:01] <decx> *to
[08:41:09] <duch_kazatel> xxx1337 i use firefox's built-in dev tools these days.
[08:41:17] <decx> i love firefox
[08:41:19] <duch_kazatel> i used to love firebug, but the built-in ones are pretty awesome.
[08:41:37] <Hausas_> So I have an issue
[08:43:19] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell i approach everybody the same - they can teach me something and i can teach them something.  whether or not we do it through expertise or simply watching the other struggle, it usually works.
[08:43:32] <Hausas_> I have an input field and whenever I hover it, the div (which position is absolute) appears. And when I move away 40px from the edge of the div - that div disappears. I wanna make it so the div wouldn't disappear if the mouse is still inside the input field.
[08:43:40] <delboy1978uk> I'm running this - $.get('api.php?uri=capacities',function(k){ //etc } , and I get this: Uncaught TypeError: Property 'promise' of object #<Object> is not a function
[08:43:51] <delboy1978uk> anyone know whats going on?
[08:44:00] <duch_kazatel> !paste
[08:44:00] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:44:39] <duch_kazatel> could you guys paste up some code?  delboy1978uk your code shouldn't fail, but something tells me you have some more that you're not sharing ;)
[08:44:57] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yeah I'm about the same approach.
[08:45:13] <decx> Hausas_ fiddle up
[08:45:24] <decx> i dont get that at all
[08:46:44] <Hausas_> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/9A8az/
[08:46:52] <Hausas_> There's no html in there
[08:46:57] <Hausas_> just two ifs
[08:47:00] <delboy1978uk> http://pastie.org/9436936
[08:47:34] <decx> well add some html and css
[08:47:36] <delboy1978uk> yeah im using app framework and i tried to use the jquery plugin so i could get autocomplete rockin'
[08:47:55] <Hausas_> css why would you need css? :)
[08:48:13] <duch_kazatel> Hausas_ we have no idea what you're actually doing without some context.
[08:48:18] <decx> to see whats going on
[08:48:28] <decx> these conditionals are a bit verbose
[08:48:50] <decx> typically you dont need collision detection stuff to detect hover
[08:49:08] <Hausas_> But I wanna have 2 conditions
[08:49:27] <duch_kazatel> delboy1978uk try to just conosle.log(k) instead of what you're doing inside that done - what same thing?
[08:49:39] <Hausas_> If the mouse is 40px away from the edge of the div AND if the mouse is outside the input wrapper
[08:49:42] <duch_kazatel> if that still breaks, delete that window.capacitites line entirely and try again
[08:49:44] <decx> so is this for like a tooltip
[08:49:50] <Hausas_> it is
[08:50:01] <decx> see that's overly complicated
[08:50:13] <Hausas_> but it's a div that has absolute position
[08:50:21] <decx> doesnt matter, still to complicated
[08:50:24] <Hausas_> The div works fine
[08:50:24] <decx> too
[08:50:36] <Hausas_> and if I move 40px away from it
[08:50:39] <Hausas_> it disappears
[08:50:59] <Hausas_> But I don't want it to disappear if the mouse is hovering the input field
[08:51:54] <delboy1978uk> duch_kazatel: i did but it doesnt run the get at all, so the console log never happens
[08:52:12] <duch_kazatel> delboy1978uk do you have two versions of jquery on the page by chance?
[08:52:40] <Hausas_> And when I try debugging it
[08:53:03] <Hausas_> It says that offset values are kinda wrong
[08:53:18] <delboy1978uk> double checked, no! heres a working version of it, before i tried using the jquery plugin http://m.allagents.co.uk/
[08:53:46] <duch_kazatel> ah-hah - try doing 'jQuery' instead of $
[08:53:56] <decx> well i'm not going to imagine how it doesnt work, complete the demo Hausas_
[08:54:36] <Hausas_> I don't wanna paste thousands of lines of code
[08:54:51] <duch_kazatel> Hausas you should be able to provide a minimal test case that doesn't use that much.
[08:54:55] <duch_kazatel> just the relevant bits :)
[08:55:19] <delboy1978uk> :-( no difference
[08:55:50] <Hausas_> lemme get the bits together
[08:56:06] <decx> from the bit we can see it just seems overly complicated
[08:56:13] <decx> you should never have to need all that for a tooltip
[08:56:40] <duch_kazatel> delboy1978uk try $.fn.jquery in your console
[08:56:51] <duch_kazatel> if that doesn't work, try jQuery.fn.jquery
[08:57:02] <duch_kazatel> that should return the version number
[08:57:04] <BillCriswell> CSS tooltips all day haha
[08:57:10] <duch_kazatel> all day erry day
[08:57:13] <decx> not even my 2d platformer has that much stuff in its collision detection ^^
[08:57:18] <Tinnit_> "f'n jquery" -- yeah that's about right
[08:57:30] <duch_kazatel> Tinnit_ hahaha hey now! we mean no harm :(
[08:57:30] <Tinnit_> ;)
[08:57:58] <Hausas_> decx: I wanna have a link on the tooltip that you can click
[08:58:24] <duch_kazatel> Hausas_ are you building the tooltip for practice, or do you need actual tooltips?
[08:59:12] <Hausas_> What do you mean? I already built the tooltips and have them working but the function which should make them disappear is misbehaving
[08:59:45] <duch_kazatel> Hausas_ i was going to suggest powertip to you, but it seems like you're pretty far along with what you've got.
[09:00:16] <Hausas_> It's just the second if in that jsfiddle that's misbehaving
[09:00:54] <duch_kazatel> without seeing what you have in front of you elsewhere, how are we supposed to know what that's doing?
[09:01:05] <Hausas_> Hmm, good point
[09:01:30] <Hausas_> lemme screenshot that for u
[09:01:35] <duch_kazatel> erm
[09:01:36] <delboy1978uk>  $.fn.jquery says 2.1.1
[09:01:37] <duch_kazatel> we need the code
[09:02:02] <Corgi> This is the culprit of all of my problems: $.get('../logout.php', {run: 'true'});
[09:02:02] <delboy1978uk> i didnt realise i could type into the console lol!
[09:02:14] <Corgi> I don't see what's wrong with it, but there is something wrong with it.
[09:02:25] <decx> i'm gonna go into speculating mode and say change all offset() to position() Hausas
[09:02:29] <Hausas_> As I said, there's nothing to see in that code. It works all fine without the second if
[09:02:51] <Hausas_> decx: position().top position().left ?
[09:02:53] <decx> because clientX is relative to the element and offset to the document
[09:02:59] <duch_kazatel> delboy1978uk :) you should check out http://fixingthesejquery.com - see if that doesn't help
[09:03:08] <decx> and position would be relative to the next element with a position property
[09:03:08] <Hausas_> That's what I needed <3
[09:03:09] <decx> yes
[09:03:11] <duch_kazatel> Corgi what's that breaking.
[09:03:16] <Hausas_> Lemme check that real quick
[09:03:28] <Corgi> duch_kazatel, It's not breaking anything, it's just not running
[09:03:42] <Corgi> It has to meet these requirements: "if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']=== 'GET' && isset($_GET['run']) && $_GET['run'] === 'true') {"
[09:03:45] <Corgi> Yet it's not.
[09:04:00] <duch_kazatel> Corgi what are you doing with the returned data?
[09:04:02] <decx> still, your do a superflous collision check because with html element you got :hover and .target which already do that much faster
[09:04:09] <Corgi> duch_kazatel, Nothing
[09:04:15] <Corgi> I don't need the returned data
[09:04:17] <Corgi> it returns nothing
[09:04:21] <Corgi> the script just unsets sessions
[09:04:36] <duch_kazatel> Corgi so you're just trying to ship some data?  try using $.ajax() instead and see if that doesn't fix anything.
[09:04:40] <Hausas_> .target ? what's that?
[09:04:44] <Hausas_> Never heard of it
[09:04:57] <Hausas_> And maybe
[09:05:04] <Hausas_> :hover would solve it :o
[09:05:12] <Hausas_> I'm so dumb
[09:05:33] <decx> and then just add your grace-margin as a padding to your tooltip
[09:05:39] <duch_kazatel> if what you're doing feels really complicated, you're probably doing it The Hard Way™
[09:05:46] <decx> now you're cooking with css only
[09:06:08] <Hausas_> I like it the hard way
[09:06:17] <duch_kazatel> unf unf unf
[09:06:29] <decx> duch_kazatel did i show you my blood splatter simulator?
[09:06:38] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Ca9Y7/show/
[09:06:41] <Corgi> duch_kazatel, Am I doing something wrong in this code?
[09:06:42] <Corgi> $.ajax({type: "GET", url: '../logout.php', data: {run: 'true'}});
[09:06:58] <Corgi> oh SHOOT
[09:07:01] <Corgi> I forgot
[09:07:08] <systemfault> Corgi: Sure… like using GET to logout..
[09:07:09] <Corgi> I can't use single quotes in JSON
[09:07:12] <Corgi> LOL
[09:07:37] <BillCriswell> That's a javascript object though, not json.
[09:07:44] <Hausas_> decx: nice!
[09:07:46] <duch_kazatel> decx++ and again you built a Neat Thing I Lke To Play With™
[09:07:54] <Corgi> yeah but it's still not working
[09:07:56] <Corgi> I don't know
[09:07:58] <Corgi> what's wrong
[09:08:43] <duch_kazatel> Corgi try running it in your console.
[09:08:49] <decx> it's actually pretty useful when i need some new grunge brushes for photoshop
[09:09:09] <Hausas_> LOL
[09:09:09] <Corgi> Velveeta, mac and cheese
[09:09:26] <Corgi> duch_kazatel, That doesn't work either
[09:09:29] <Corgi> It redirects
[09:09:32] <Corgi> The script just doesn't run
[09:09:42] <Corgi> (redirection from the line below it, window.location.href = '/';)
[09:09:58] <Velveeta> and we're back!
[09:10:17] <duch_kazatel> check your network panel - do you see the request run?
[09:10:25] <duch_kazatel> because if so, then your issue is server-side.
[09:10:27] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta ++
[09:10:45] <Corgi> Looking at fiddler...
[09:10:51] <Corgi> It doesn't say anything about logout.php
[09:10:58] <Corgi> Just the page I redirect to
[09:11:00] <Corgi> the homepage.
[09:11:06] <duch_kazatel> are you persisting your logs?
[09:11:15] <Corgi> duch_kazatel, What's that supposed to mean
[09:11:30] <Corgi> words are too fancy
[09:11:32] <duch_kazatel> do the logs clear when you click a normal link?
[09:12:09] <Corgi> duch_kazatel, I don't think so - it keeps all of the logs ever since I start the program
[09:12:17] <Hausas_> I just noticed one extra line in my code
[09:12:23] <Hausas_> that might have been breaking it
[09:12:31] <delboy1978uk> cheers guys, that weid error has gone, but now THIS is cracking up?! window.capacities =  $.parseJSON(k);
[09:12:36] <delboy1978uk> unexpected token o
[09:12:36] <duch_kazatel> hrm.  something really funky is going on then Corgi.
[09:12:40] <delboy1978uk> wtf?
[09:12:48] <duch_kazatel> delboy1978uk that means your JSON isn't valid.
[09:12:53] <delboy1978uk> really?
[09:12:56] <delboy1978uk> cheers
[09:13:02] <duch_kazatel> :)

[09:13:26] <delboy1978uk> it /looks/ ok
[09:13:27] <duch_kazatel> does it start with the word Object ?
[09:13:37] <delboy1978uk> thats in the console log
[09:13:54] <duch_kazatel> look at the raw response - hit the page directly.
[09:14:00] <dagerik> Corgi: describe ur problem better
[09:14:18] <duch_kazatel> Corgi can you create a fiddle?  even if it doesn't function, it'd be helpful.
[09:14:38] <delboy1978uk> looks ok? http://m.allagents.co.uk/api.php?uri=capacities
[09:15:01] <duch_kazatel> delboy1978uk you don't need to pass that to the parseJSON function in that case.
[09:15:08] <duch_kazatel> you can just use it.
[09:15:21] <delboy1978uk> huh? ok i'll try that lol, thanks
[09:17:09] <Corgi> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/VEbLB/
[09:17:19] <delboy1978uk> awesome!!
[09:17:51] <duch_kazatel> Corgi first off, don't bind in html like that.
[09:18:08] <delboy1978uk> before i added the jquery plugin i had loads of parseJSON's everywhere and it worked! so i have now got rid of them! hopefully my autosuggest should work now#
[09:18:14] <delboy1978uk> thanks duch_kazatel
[09:18:35] <Corgi> duch_kazatel, I'm getting the entire front-end rewritten when the server-side stuff is done.
[09:18:39] <duch_kazatel> definitely - you only need to use parseJSON when you're getting it back as a string.  you have an object there, so you should be dine.
[09:19:26] <duch_kazatel> Corgi also, the ajax call won't complete before you change the window's location.
[09:19:37] <Corgi> oh
[09:19:39] <Corgi> that must be the problem
[09:19:45] <Corgi> let me add .done
[09:19:52] <duch_kazatel> it's asyncronous
[09:20:10] <Corgi> NOOOOOOOOW it works
[09:20:11] <Corgi> :D
[09:20:40] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/VEbLB/1/ - there you go :)
[09:21:00] <duch_kazatel> ajax calls don't stop the script before completing - they get fired off and the script continues normally.
[09:22:24] <dagerik> how to explain async behaviour to newcomers. is it possible or must they all first fail
[09:22:33] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[09:22:49] <duch_kazatel> oh, how do you get them to understand without first trying?
[09:23:02] <dagerik> yes
[09:23:29] <decx> if i send you a letter with a question about a recipe, i have to wait for you to send it back to me before i can use your answer to bake my cake
[09:23:36] <duch_kazatel> it's because of the word ajax - i wonder how many devs know it's short for "asyncronous javascript and xml"
[09:23:41] <duch_kazatel> decx++
[09:23:48] <duch_kazatel> that's a great way to put it.
[09:26:27] <systemfault> We’re pretty much all using AJAJ :P
[09:26:33] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[09:26:38] <duch_kazatel> SOAP 4eva
[09:26:40] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[09:26:48] <systemfault> Hmm, no. Just no. :P
[09:30:27] <Hausas_> Any suggestions on scrolling the page so an element would be in the middle of the screen? (That's for jstree)
[09:32:43] <duch_kazatel> which part are you stuck on?
[09:35:43] <NoiseEee> Hausas_: https://github.com/flesler/jquery.scrollTo
[09:36:05] <jeffreylevesque> could someone help my connecting my javascript to websocket?
[09:36:37] <duch_kazatel> jeffreylevesque you'll likely have more luck in a room dedicated to the library you're using.
[09:36:46] <canaap> Hi
[09:37:08] <jeffreylevesque> duch_kazatel: there's 12 ppl in the autobahn channel
[09:37:18] <canaap> i genrate a div with   var row = $('<div class="sc-row builder-row">' + helperDiv + '</div>'); append and so
[09:37:27] <canaap> but i cant use the click event on the generated elements with jquery
[09:37:30] <duch_kazatel> jeffreylevesque this is a channel dedicated to jquery - it's not the appropriate forum
[09:37:40] <duch_kazatel> canaap you want event delegation
[09:37:50] <canaap> dayum i forgot how :D
[09:37:59] <duch_kazatel> check out the section of the docs for .on() about Direct and Delegated events.
[09:38:08] <canaap> okay thx
[09:38:10] <duch_kazatel> $(parent).on('event', 'child', function() {});
[09:38:26] <Hausas_> NoiseEee: what about not using external APIs?
[09:38:28] <duch_kazatel> where "child" is your current target and parent is an ancestor that exists on pageload.
[09:38:59] <canaap> thx found a example here http://jsfiddle.net/PzSYM/361/
[09:39:06] <NoiseEee> Hausas_: its not an external API, it extends jquery.  but if you're asking if jquery or javascript has a "scrollTo" type of function naturally, no it does not.
[09:39:23] <Hausas_> but it has scrollTop
[09:39:28] <NoiseEee> yep
[09:39:34] <NoiseEee> well top is always easy to find isnt it
[09:39:39] <Hausas_> Which is buggy in my case
[09:39:42] <NoiseEee> but a particular element in the DOM?
[09:40:00] <Hausas_> scrollTop + jquery should work
[09:40:07] <Hausas_> but it doesnt in my case
[09:40:22] <NoiseEee> Hausas_: jsfiddle
[09:40:26] <Hausas_> As I have this $('#TreePane').scrollTop($('.jstree-clicked').position().top);
[09:40:29] <deliquent0x4> what do you think of my new idea .. trollpatrol.com
[09:40:34] <Hausas_> and it just scrolls wherever
[09:42:29] <canaap> works thankx
[09:42:38] <duch_kazatel> yep
[09:53:32] <Mushr00m> bi guys !
[09:53:36] <Mushr00m> *hi
[09:54:12] <Mushr00m> I'm trying to create my first plugin that should transform select inputs to dropdown list
[09:54:29] <Mushr00m> But I can't find the "right" boilerplate or structure to use
[09:55:01] <Mushr00m> do you have any direction to point me ? maybe a simple plugin that I can't look at the code
[09:55:19] <Mushr00m> (one that does some DOM modification like mine)
[09:55:42] <duch_kazatel> select2 does that.
[09:57:03] <Mushr00m> Wow that's a big peace of plugin ^^ Maybe to hard to "understand" the structure
[09:57:12] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[09:57:37] <Mushr00m> I mean I don't a plugin that already do the job, I want to learn to code one
[09:57:54] <Mushr00m> so I need some basic boilerplate but on the web I found like 10 different way
[09:58:03] <Mushr00m> I don't know what is the proper way
[09:58:48] <robertmaxrees> start here: http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[09:58:58] <robertmaxrees> and keep reading.
[10:00:40] <Mushr00m> Ok i'll read that know
[10:00:55] <Mushr00m> and while I'm here is this structure still valid : http://www.lafermeduweb.net/billet/jquery-plugin-boilerplate-une-structure-de-base-pour-dev-vos-plugins-1100.html
[10:00:56] <Mushr00m> ?
[10:01:28] <wolfy1339> how do i animate an element on mouse hover?
[10:01:30] <Mushr00m> because I watched Jeff Way videos and he didn't use this at all
[10:02:53] <deliquent0x4> sry to be slightly ot but no ones around in #css. is using percentages to position elements a bad idea when your stretching images because I'm seeing a strange thing where the element I am trying to position relative to the image it self is ending up with left: percentages of 120% and offset bottom: -144px; which seems weird considering this is a fairly large screen ... but should I just use
[10:02:54] <deliquent0x4> jquery to stretch the image to the size of the container exactly and then i can reliably position based on offsets that make sense? .. what would guys you do?
[10:03:49] <robertmaxrees> wolfy1339 bind to .on()
[10:04:04] <robertmaxrees> Mushr00m that page is throwing errors for me.
[10:04:19] <robertmaxrees> and was blocked by my antivirus.  i would not use it.
[10:04:55] <Mushr00m> wow strange
[10:05:00] <Mushr00m> it's a french website
[10:05:05] <Mushr00m> I give you an other link
[10:05:06] <robertmaxrees> just use the jquery site.
[10:05:07] <robertmaxrees> start there.
[10:06:26] <Mushr00m> ok
[10:27:28] <BillCriswell> Ugh, retina images.
[10:27:45] <BillCriswell> Can't believe we have to do this shit. Wish it was something that took care of itself automatically lol
[10:27:50] <robertmaxrees> hahahahhaa
[10:28:01] <drej> lol
[10:28:05] <drej> automagical retina images
[10:28:22] <drej> apparently automagical is a real word, my spellcheck thinks iti s
[10:28:43] <BillCriswell> Those words get abused so bad haha
[10:29:31] <BillCriswell> If there was a connection media query it wouldn't bother me too much, but just sending the default image plus the retina image to certain devices  because it has a bitchin screen seems silly.
[10:29:53] <BillCriswell> If they have the speed and data to spare why the hell not. Most of the time they don't.
[10:30:02] <drej> yeah its a little ass backwards
[10:30:05] <drej> most devices with retina are mobile
[10:30:07] <robertmaxrees> *bitchin DPI
[10:30:13] <drej> where we should be conserving bandwidth
[10:30:18] <drej> but nobody talks about that
[10:30:38] <BillCriswell> drej: Absolutely.
[10:30:54] <drej> lets do it
[10:30:59] <drej> lest make a polyfill or some sort of smart plugin
[10:31:05] <drej> that determines when it makes sense to serve up retina
[10:31:17] <drej> based on bandwidth or device capability or the phase of the moon cycle currently
[10:31:20] <drej> or whatever other things we can throw at it
[10:31:26] <drej> i have mobilizer.com
[10:31:26] <BillCriswell> drej: I feel like people a lot smarter than me have tried that and failed.
[10:31:28] <drej> we can use that
[10:31:44] <BillCriswell> nice url haha
[10:32:22] <drej> oh wait mine is mobilezer.com
[10:32:35] <BillCriswell> Sounds lke... mobile gezer?
[10:32:44] <robertmaxrees> mobilegeezer.org
[10:32:46] <robertmaxrees> but it.
[10:32:49] <robertmaxrees> *buy
[10:33:06] <BillCriswell> I really want to buy a few from here one day: http://dumb.domains/
[10:33:16] <drej> oh i also own rsponsv.com
[10:33:38] <BillCriswell> The o is the only vowels that gets to play.
[10:33:48] <drej> its really the only vowel that matters
[10:34:43] <BillCriswell> I concur.
[10:34:59] <madghost> Is it really to do Single Page Application with only jQuery ?
[10:35:00] <BillCriswell> I concr*
[10:35:17] <drej> concr*
[10:35:19] <drej> (no i)
[10:35:35] <BillCriswell> madghost: I think you missed a verb?
[10:35:52] <robertmaxrees> madghost or an adjective.
[10:36:04] <robertmaxrees> brb i accidentally an entire bottle of coke
[10:36:12] <BillCriswell> That's what I meant.
[10:36:14] <drej> or a supposition
[10:47:36] <gnarf> `101
[10:47:49] <gnarf> b-ot: 101
[10:47:54] * gnarf frowns
[10:47:58] <gnarf> ?101
[10:48:21] <wolfy1339> i finished some code and i have one problem, the opacity of the overlay is set to 1 even though i'm not hovering it: http://qp.mniip.com/p/qqf
[10:49:18] <robertmaxrees> can you make a jsfiddle?
[10:50:10] <wolfy1339> sure thing
[10:51:28] <jak2000> hi all
[10:55:45] <robertmaxrees> hey there
[10:57:46] <wolfy1339> http://jsbin.com/geqiwixu/57/ here it is
[10:59:59] <robertmaxrees> wolfy1339 okay, so how to i replicate the problem?
[11:02:33] <phoenixsun> it may be a weird question but in order to create an EventListener listening for a click does it have to be binded to the CSS or Html definition of a button or can it be any object on the page
[11:02:35] <phoenixsun> ?
[11:02:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:02:49] <robertmaxrees> it can be any node.
[11:02:59] <robertmaxrees> *any node that can emit events
[11:03:05] <phoenixsun> oh great
[11:03:09] <phoenixsun> thanks
[11:03:42] <phoenixsun> is there a list of nodes that can emit events somewhere?
[11:04:10] <robertmaxrees> any node?  your question is very strange - could you clarify what you meant by "to the css or Html definition" ?
[11:05:16] <phoenixsun> I guess what I was asking is can anything be made into a button and emit an event
[11:05:24] <jak2000> exist 2 versions of jquery, jquery1 and jquery2 why? which download?
[11:05:36] <robertmaxrees> phoenixsun you can bind a click handler to almost any element.
[11:05:37] <systemfault> jak2000: Do you need to support IE8?
[11:05:45] <drej> jak2000 1 if you need to support older browsers (ie8 and lower)
[11:05:50] <drej> 2 if its for modern browsers
[11:05:52] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 the 2.x series drops support for old IE, but they are the same otherwise.
[11:05:53] <drej> what systemfault  said
[11:05:57] <systemfault> jak2000: Both have the same featureset.
[11:06:44] <phoenixsun> robertmaxrees: ok I am using a CSS based button set and I will see if I can bind a click handler to an <i> element
[11:06:53] <robertmaxrees> phoenixsun you can.
[11:07:10] <phoenixsun> robertmaxrees: great thanks
[11:11:24] <jak2000> drej understand..
[11:12:21] <jak2000> a tutorial say me: "download: jQuery and jQueryUI" i downloaded jquery-2.1.1.min.js and renamed to jquery.js but where download jqueryUI ?
[11:13:01] <drej> http://jqueryui.com/
[11:13:38] <jak2000> ok,thanks
[11:16:41] <Blaster> Hey can someone help me.  I have been struggling with this problem for a few days.   I can fix it with a kludge but I want an elegant solution.
[11:16:58] <Blaster> I am trying to focus the select box after reloading it over AJAX.  http://jsfiddle.net/3D852/1/
[11:17:36] <robertmaxrees> Blaster don't replace the element in the ajax success.
[11:17:37] <Blaster> But the $elem variable references the old one, not the new one.  I am trying to find some way to "refresh" the attachment of that variable to the new select element.
[11:17:43] <robertmaxrees> also - use .done() instead of success.
[11:17:53] <Blaster> robertmaxrees, why don't replace the select?
[11:18:01] <robertmaxrees> because it's apparently unnecessary.
[11:18:09] <Blaster> robertmaxrees, In this context, yes.
[11:18:18] <Blaster> But in my app it loads a list of states and countries.
[11:18:22] <Blaster> cities*
[11:18:28] <Blaster> When you select a country.
[11:18:34] <robertmaxrees> if that's not doable, then you need to get a unique identifier on that particular select and go from there.
[11:18:39] <BillCriswell> Blaster: Put the var $elem = $('select'); AFTER you append the data.
[11:18:57] <Blaster> It's not that simple.  In my actual app it's a bit different.
[11:19:02] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell they probably have many selects.
[11:19:09] <Blaster> I get the reference from $(this) inside the on change listener.
[11:19:12] <robertmaxrees> and want to focus on a particular one.
[11:19:21] <Blaster> I'll update to reflect that, sorry.
[11:19:25] <robertmaxrees> Blaster you'll have to get a unique ID on it in your backend.
[11:19:35] <Blaster> http://jsfiddle.net/3D852/3/
[11:19:55] <Blaster> That's the only way?
[11:20:00] <robertmaxrees> anything you try to do in your frontend to handle this will be a kludge
[11:20:29] <Blaster> if I console.log(this) inside the listener, I get <select>.  Can't I reattach to the select element based on that?
[11:20:53] <BillCriswell> I have lost track of things.
[11:21:00] <robertmaxrees> no, because that object no longer exists.
[11:21:42] <robertmaxrees> is there something about that dropdown that you can use to uniquely identify it?
[11:21:45] <robertmaxrees> maybe a name attribute?
[11:21:58] <Blaster> Yeah in my app they have an id of #country #state and #city.
[11:22:06] <wolfy1339> robertmaxrees, the opacity on .overlay is set to 1 immediately, i you hover over the images and then the mouse leaves opacity goes to 0 (what should be initial valuae)
[11:22:11] <robertmaxrees> then you're done - save the ID and reselect on that, Blaster
[11:22:38] <Blaster> Okay, I was trying to find a better solution than that.  That's what I already do.
[11:22:47] <Blaster> But if you think it's elegant than I will stick to it.
[11:22:50] <robertmaxrees> Blaster the kludge isn't the JS - it's the backend.
[11:22:58] <Blaster> Why's that?
[11:22:58] <robertmaxrees> you're reloading things you don't need to reload.
[11:23:21] <Blaster> Well, the entire <form> gets reloaded.
[11:23:22] <robertmaxrees> i'd argue you should be shipping around data instead of markup in this particular case.
[11:23:31] <robertmaxrees> right - i'm saying that's not the right way to do it.
[11:23:55] <Blaster> It works pretty well, other than this part.
[11:24:13] <robertmaxrees> you're retransmitting things the browser already has.,
[11:24:37] <robertmaxrees> wasting bandwidth and running into a bug that would've been avoidable otherwise :)
[11:25:29] <Blaster> I agree with you, but that way is a lot harder with the backend framework I am using.
[11:26:08] <robertmaxrees> i'm just pointing it out - like I said, the issue isn't with the JS in this case.  it's with your backend.
[11:26:24] <Blaster> Yep.  Makes sense.  Thanks for your help.
[11:28:15] <BillCriswell> The new safari is pretty sweet. Might give it a go for  abit.
[11:30:23] <BillCriswell> What, no support for console.table
[11:30:25] <BillCriswell> Nevermind.
[11:30:33] <BillCriswell> Back to Chrome.
[11:34:52] <jak2000> hi friends. anyone here use a jtable? i use but not display here my code and question: https://github.com/hikalkan/jtable/issues/1443
[11:35:53] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 put the jtable stuff after the jquery stuff.
[11:38:20] <jak2000> okay
[11:40:00] <jak2000> robertmaxrees done but continue not show the jtable :(
[11:41:24] <BillCriswell> The things I'm doing with JS right now would make my mother disown me.
[11:41:25] <Mike817> hi all
[11:41:34] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 could you create a jsfiddle?
[11:42:27] <Mike817> I'm trying to set focus() on the parent div of an input field.  so i'm using $("#inputfield").parent.focus() but that's not working. anyone know why?
[11:42:36] <wolfy1339> i finished some code and i have one problem, the opacity of the overlay is set to 1 even though i'm not hovering it: http://jsbin.com/geqiwixu/57/
[11:42:47] <robertmaxrees> Mike817 .parent should probably be .parents()
[11:42:49] <wolfy1339> to reproduce, the opacity on .overlay is set to 1 immediately, i you hover over the images and then the mouse leaves opacity goes to 0 (what should be initial valuae)
[11:44:04] <robertmaxrees> wolfy1339 your code sets the opacity to 0.  what should it be instead?
[11:44:46] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/GwX43/
[11:44:53] <SuperTyp> may someone help me with the error I get on this side: http://vfrbb.de/vfr
[11:45:07] <SuperTyp> (intermediate function)(...) is not a function... =(
[11:45:15] <wolfy1339> it should be 0 initially, then on mousweover opacity of 1 then on mouseleave set opacity back to 0 using animations for all the sequences
[11:45:27] <msafi> Do promises fire global events when they are resolved/rejected so that the .then function gets called?
[11:45:52] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 http://i.imgur.com/iQxNg1j.png you need to include the js here.
[11:45:58] <robertmaxrees> in the external resources.
[11:47:06] <robertmaxrees> wolfy1339 what part are you stuck on?  you're setting them all to 1 initially and then setting them to 0 on mouseleave
[11:47:30] <wolfy1339> let me update it
[11:47:46] <Mike817> robertmaxrees: that doesn't work either.  http://jsfiddle.net/Q5ny8/
[11:48:05] <Mike817> i'm wondering if it's because the parent div isn't unique
[11:48:16] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: in external resources? right
[11:50:02] <robertmaxrees> Mike817 i'm not sure divs can actually recieve focus.
[11:50:15] <wolfy1339> robertmaxrees, i updated the JS code, now i i hover only one of the images, all of the overlays are set to opacity of 1
[11:50:26] <Mike817> anything with an id can i believe
[11:50:36] <robertmaxrees> Mike817 not necessarily.
[11:50:50] <robertmaxrees> wolfy1339 i'm sorry, are you familiar with jquery at all?
[11:51:10] <wolfy1339> not at all
[11:51:23] <robertmaxrees> that explains it - you should start by visiting learn.jquery.com
[11:52:18] <jak2000> robertmaxrees, click on + (external resources) but not open for load any file
[11:52:31] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you have to give it a link from a cdn.
[11:52:35] <robertmaxrees> you can't upload from your hard drive
[11:52:46] <Mike817> robertmaxrees: that's weird.  if you use a div id in the url e.g. mypage.htm#divname  it jumps right to it.  so it seems like it should be able to take a focus()
[11:52:51] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 i should back up and also point you to learn.jquery.com - you should probably start with the basics.
[11:52:57] <robertmaxrees> Mike817 that's a different concept.
[11:53:04] <robertmaxrees> # is not the same as focusing.
[11:53:12] <robertmaxrees> could you clarify what you're trying to do?
[11:53:23] <jak2000> robertmaxrees ok
[11:53:31] <Mike817> basically just focus a little higher than the actual input field
[11:53:56] <robertmaxrees> okay - focus() just puts the cursor there.  you want to scroll to that element automatically.
[11:54:25] <Mike817> basically
[11:54:26] <robertmaxrees> Mike817 start with this method: http://api.jquery.com/scrolltop/
[11:54:37] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you could find a scrolltop plugin.
[11:55:03] <Mike817> i want to jump to the top of the containing element
[11:55:16] <Mike817> sorry slipped on the return key there
[11:57:01] <robertmaxrees> $('html, body').scrollTop( $('#field4').parent().offset().top ); <- try that
[11:57:29] <hackal> hello is it necessary to use jQuery(document).ready(function(){ in linked script file?
[11:57:37] <robertmaxrees> hackal depends.
[11:57:50] <robertmaxrees> if it's linked in the <head> and your code relies on elements existing, yes.
[11:58:07] <Mike817> nice. didn't really think of doing it that way.  just assumed anything with an id could take a focus
[11:58:23] <robertmaxrees> Mike817 focus has literally nothing to do with what you want ;)
[11:58:52] <robertmaxrees> when you do url.com/#someID, that's actually not the same as using .focus() on an element
[11:59:14] <Mike817> lol.
[11:59:23] <Mike817> well they seem similar :)
[12:00:05] <robertmaxrees> very dissimilar :) also - check out learn.jquery.com.  you might find that helpful.
[12:01:00] <canaap> i have this var num = $(this).attr('class').match(/\d+$/); the ouput is ["2", index: 10, input: "sc-col-md-2"]
[12:01:09] <canaap> but cant get the "2" with num[0]
[12:02:03] <robertmaxrees> canaap have a fiddle?
[12:03:01] <BillCriswell> Hm.. just realized & in sass is pretty confusing when you get a little deep.
[12:03:23] <robertmaxrees> or the string that $(this).attr('class') returns.
[12:03:29] <robertmaxrees> btw use .prop() not .attr()
[12:04:30] * jak2000 uploading 186 files of jtable for create a fiddle
[12:04:35] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 wat
[12:04:38] <BillCriswell> Jesus.
[12:04:41] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you shouldn't need to do that at all.
[12:04:51] <robertmaxrees> you should have 1 file in that external resources.
[12:04:54] <jak2000> robertmaxrees but jtable uses not?
[12:04:57] <NoiseEee> lol
[12:05:15] <robertmaxrees> it had one file.
[12:05:20] <jak2000> wich?
[12:05:21] <robertmaxrees> where did you get 186 from?
[12:05:24] <robertmaxrees> the js file.
[12:05:39] <canaap> got it
[12:05:51] <canaap> the console.log was weired but now is working
[12:05:55] <canaap> simple aler(num)
[12:05:57] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 one sec.
[12:05:59] <jak2000> this:     <script src="/css/jtable/jquery.jtable.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[12:06:01] <jak2000> ok
[12:06:51] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/s7kz3/
[12:06:53] <robertmaxrees> there.
[12:06:57] <robertmaxrees> fill in your html and js
[12:07:32] <jak2000> ok
[12:11:01] <hackal> is there a way to select more elements?
[12:11:11] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/s7kz3/1/    ?
[12:11:28] <robertmaxrees> hackal meaning...?
[12:11:41] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 http://jsfiddle.net/s7kz3/2/
[12:11:46] <robertmaxrees> no script tags in the javascript panel
[12:12:21] <hackal> robertmaxrees: my bad, just wanted to do jQuery('#my_id_1, #my_id_2');
[12:12:38] <Mike817> robertmaxrees: thanks for the help!
[12:12:42] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 also, you're missing a few commas in the actions object -> http://jsfiddle.net/s7kz3/3/
[12:12:47] <robertmaxrees> Mike817 my pleasure :)
[12:13:17] <Mike817> fyi. i've been doing this a long time. that's just a particular situation that's never come up for me before :)
[12:14:27] <robertmaxrees> Mike817 not questioning how long you've been doing anything - there's a lot of FUD and bad information floating around out there.  when I see people doing things like $('selector').parent.focus(), i'm inclined to shoot out learn.jquery.com.
[12:14:33] <robertmaxrees> nothing personal about it :)
[12:14:40] <Mike817> lol
[12:15:07] <Mike817> i just hate sounding like a noob. ;)
[12:15:16] <robertmaxrees> nah, you don't.  that's my job.
[12:15:36] <hackal> looks like datepicker.regional['en'] is not supported

[12:29:19] <DarkChaoz> i need help with jquery mobile
[12:29:30] <DarkChaoz> can someone help me
[12:29:42] <DarkChaoz> have an issue with data role table
[12:56:01] <Blaster> Hey I have a question, why do both anchor elements trigger a console.log here?  I would expect only the one nested inside the div would.  http://jsfiddle.net/g4v53/
[12:59:00] <systemfault> The second param of .on is a selector, not a node
[12:59:37] <systemfault> You might consider using $outer.on('click', 'a', function() {
[12:59:46] <systemfault> Or
[12:59:56] <systemfault> $(document).on('click', ‘#outer a’, function() {
[13:00:06] <systemfault> Depending on your needs
[13:11:40] <robertmaxrees> what a day!
[13:12:17] <BillCriswell> A 24 hour period of time.
[13:12:21] <robertmaxrees> derp
[13:12:55] <BillCriswell> 8-)
[13:24:54] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Why "what a day"
[13:25:13] <robertmaxrees> more like "what a week" - just crazy at work.
[13:25:20] <robertmaxrees> and the mod status yesterdau.
[13:25:34] <drej> i have not laid down a single line of production code this week
[13:26:14] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: I hope you got some cake.
[13:26:24] <BillCriswell> drej: I hear that.
[13:26:32] <robertmaxrees> i started out the week thinking "I'm going the distance"
[13:26:35] <robertmaxrees> eyoooo
[13:26:35] <BillCriswell> My hours this week are going to look terrible.
[13:34:27] <xxx1337> hey i get this weird bug on my site that happens only in chrome and only 50% of the time. Try navigating to the amenities page and back to the neighborhood page in chrome and the background is grey (the background image doesn't load). anyone have any clue why? http://neoscapelabs.com/projects/rxr_northhills/neighborhood.php
[13:35:31] <robertmaxrees> i assume by "the background" you mean that map?
[13:36:17] <xxx1337> yea
[13:36:53] <xxx1337> if you resize the page it will load though
[13:37:20] <xxx1337> is there a jquery script that resizes the page by 1 pixel but doesn't resize the browser?
[13:37:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:37:34] * drej blinks
[13:37:37] <xxx1337> or something lol
[13:37:38] <systemfault> Nice question
[13:37:44] <systemfault> Made my day :)
[13:37:50] <robertmaxrees> you can fire the resize event.
[13:37:53] <robertmaxrees> but that's a bad idea.
[13:39:05] <xxx1337> i dont actually want to resize the window
[13:39:15] <xxx1337> just want to get this image loading
[13:39:44] <robertmaxrees> it looks like you're loading the image multiple times.
[13:40:00] <xxx1337> i'm loading multiple maps
[13:40:20] <xxx1337> there is a script that changes the map depending on the size of the browser
[13:40:39] <robertmaxrees> i could only get it to happen once.
[13:40:49] <xxx1337> get what to happen once?
[13:40:54] <robertmaxrees> the bug
[13:41:17] <xxx1337> happens quite often for me, but then again im on an old version of chrome
[13:41:23] <xxx1337> 31 i think
[13:55:11] <robertmaxrees> anybody else here use New Relic's browser reporting?
[14:01:26] <amh345> I'm trying to create a mobile version of my site. a lot of my regular jquery/js is working but there are a few things that are not (at least in iOS safari)
[14:02:05] <amh345> on desktop $('form').on('blur', 'input', function (e) { $(this)} will get the current input field.  on mobile it doesnt.
[14:02:19] <amh345> now. this on mobile works. $("input").blur(function(e) {}
[14:02:51] <amh345> however my form actually refreshes when there's an error.  and $("input").blur(function(e) {} doesnt pick up the refresh.
[14:03:21] <amh345> i've tried .live("blur") as well in iOS safari and that doesnt pick up either.   is there a trick to this?
[14:04:21] <frank_o> Hi, in Chrome, how do I disable that blue close icon that appears after I type something into http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/72d94/1/ ?
[14:04:42] <frank_o> Thought I was going crazy. Maybe I should take this to #chromium-support
[14:05:05] <amh345> i don't see it.
[14:05:08] <amh345> I'm on osx though.
[14:05:19] <frank_o> Oh I see
[14:05:27] <frank_o> Well it's horrible
[14:05:34] <systemfault> amh345: Just for fun, try using the focusout event instead of blur
[14:05:36] <amh345> oh. i do see it. it's grey though. it's an "X"
[14:05:37] <frank_o> Misaligned, and with a radial gradient
[14:06:00] <systemfault> amh345: I guess that jQuery normalizes “blur”… but test “focusout” anyway
[14:06:04] <frank_o> its grey over there? strange
[14:07:32] <amh345> systemfault: it looks like it worked!   $('form').on('focusout', 'input', function (e) {  });
[14:07:41] <systemfault> amh345: Nice!
[14:07:45] <amh345> man, i hope that works with android.  I'm sure it does.
[14:07:51] <amh345> thanks. much appreciated.
[14:07:54] <systemfault> amh345: Basically… the “blur” event doesn’t bubble...
[14:08:08] <systemfault> amh345: focusout is the “bubbling” equivalent of blur
[14:08:24] <systemfault> Like focusin is the bubbling equivalent of focus
[14:08:47] <nick1> hi all, i'm trying to figure out why my JS isn't loading properly
[14:08:50] <nick1> I have code on the page for a tooltip that doesn't seem to work
[14:08:52] <amh345> is focusout more flexible ?  i guess what I'm wondering is if i should switch blur where applicable.
[14:08:53] <nick1> but if i paste into console it works
[14:08:56] <nick1> the code is here http://coursepickle.com/order
[14:08:56] <nick1> ctrl f for question
[14:09:11] <systemfault> amh345: It bubbles… that’s the only difference.
[14:09:37] <nick1> more specifically, $(".question").tooltip() works in console
[14:09:38] <amh345> frank_o: this might be a start? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11538192/stop-chrome-from-auto-styling-input-type-search
[14:09:42] <nick1> but on the page it doesn't seem to be loading?
[14:09:49] <amh345> ok thank you systemfault.  ill keep that in mind.
[14:10:37] <frank_o> amh345: thanks so much :)
[14:10:52] <frank_o> was just writing my own question there
[14:12:51] <amh345> :)
[14:13:13] <nick1> either of you great people want to help me troubleshoot?
[14:16:31] <amh345> nick1: i had a peek. but I'm doing a lot of digging trying to find all the pieces.
[14:16:43] <amh345> have you tried a scaled down version in jsfiddle?
[14:17:07] <amh345> I'm also pretty shit at query. sooo...
[14:17:11] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[14:17:21] <nick1> i would, but i'm sure it would work on jsfiddle - trying to find what is stopping it from working on my site
[14:17:37] <robertmaxrees> nick1 what's the issue?
[14:17:56] <nick1> robertmaxrees $(".question").tooltip() doesn't work when it's in the HTML
[14:18:03] <nick1> but it does when in the console
[14:18:05] <nick1> i'm not sure why
[14:18:06] <robertmaxrees> any errors in the console?
[14:18:12] <nick1> no
[14:18:16] <robertmaxrees> is .question loaded via ajax?
[14:18:16] <amh345> no logging by the looks of it.
[14:18:17] <NoiseEee> nick1: you don't put javasript in the middle of html, for one.
[14:18:19] <jak2000> robertmaxrees, can you recommend me (please) other datagrid container? know one? thanks
[14:18:28] <nick1> NoiseEee it's in script tags
[14:18:32] <NoiseEee> nick1: put all your JS before </body>
[14:18:37] <nick1> it is before /body
[14:18:41] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 can't think of any.
[14:18:50] <NoiseEee> nick1: it doesn't matter; you're likely loading the libs after you call tooltip()
[14:18:58] <NoiseEee> nick1: pastebin some code
[14:19:20] <nick1> oh so because I don't have document.ready
[14:19:24] <nick1> that's a geat point, let me try that
[14:19:39] <robertmaxrees> nick1 is the thing you're selecting getting loaded via ajax?
[14:19:44] <robertmaxrees> because that's important too.
[14:19:55] <jak2000> robertmaxrees thanks
[14:20:20] <jak2000> i am testing jtable, but it connect to database... and by moment not need database.
[14:20:48] <robertmaxrees> there's a library called datatables.
[14:20:51] <robertmaxrees> lots of people use it.
[14:21:24] <jak2000> ok i do a google search: datatables+jquery right?
[14:21:37] <robertmaxrees> did you try?
[14:21:51] <jak2000> http://www.datatables.net/
[14:22:14] <jak2000> thanks
[14:22:19] <jak2000> i learn/study at the night
[14:22:37] <robertmaxrees> you probably want to slow down and start with javascript/jquery basics btw
[14:22:52] <jak2000> basically i want a table for add row(1 of the fields need be calculated)
[14:22:54] <nick1> hmmmmm
[14:23:11] <jak2000> robertmaxrees yes i do to learn javascript/jquery basics on the fly..
[14:23:25] <robertmaxrees> did you run through all of learn.jquery.com?
[14:24:08] <nick1> great well it's working now
[14:24:15] <nick1> just missing the CSS for some reason
[14:24:30] <jak2000> yes i read..  and readd.. but i learn better atthe night on my work is impossible
[14:24:32] <NoiseEee> nick1: probably bad paths
[14:24:39] <nick1> what do you mean?
[14:27:53] <nick1> NoiseEee
[14:29:08] <NoiseEee> "missing the CSS for some reason" i don't know what that means; if it means you're not picking up the styles then likely you are not loading the CSS file.
[14:34:41] <nick1> sorry NoiseEee, I meant to say that I was expecting the popup tooltip to be styled with bootstrap's default tooltip class
[14:34:48] <nick1> I can't figure out how to debug why it isn't
[14:55:37] <jrbalsano> Hey can anyone help me figure out how best to go about debugging jQuery UI Sortable?
[14:55:49] <robertmaxrees> fixingthesejquery.com <- give this a read.
[14:56:22] <robertmaxrees> if you still need help, go ahead and just ask :)
[14:57:44] <jrbalsano> I'll take a quick read through but I have a hunch I'll be back (I'm sure you've heard that 1000 times)
[14:57:56] <robertmaxrees> always worth a try :)
[15:01:07] <jrbalsano> First question: are the bullet points on these slides a man riding a narwhal?
[15:01:29] <robertmaxrees> why yes.
[15:01:31] <robertmaxrees> yes it is.
[15:01:47] <robertmaxrees> written by our very own ajpiano :)
[15:02:28] <jrbalsano> hahaha awesome
[15:03:04] <jrbalsano> Okay, second question is I'm dealing with this problem
[15:03:05] <jrbalsano> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2451528/jquery-ui-sortable-scroll-helper-element-offset-firefox-issue
[15:03:36] <robertmaxrees> okay
[15:03:42] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/3497194/923919
[15:04:04] <jrbalsano> I've tried the proposed fixes. The setting overflow: auto one is close to working exactly how I'd like but I can't quite get the behavior I need
[15:04:25] <robertmaxrees> are you able to share what you're doing?  maybe via jsfiddle?
[15:04:34] <jrbalsano> That's actually my biggest problem
[15:04:41] <jrbalsano> I can't create it outside of the application I'm working in
[15:04:49] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[15:04:55] <jrbalsano> So I was coming here looking for help with actually diving into the jQuery UI code
[15:05:20] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to get you very far, since your issue likely doesn't lie there.
[15:05:48] <jrbalsano> well I'm trying to understand exactly how the UI's sortable functionality derives what the position should  be
[15:06:19] <robertmaxrees> that shouldn't be an issue for you :)
[15:06:20] <jrbalsano> I'm hoping understanding that will help me figure out how to fix the problem
[15:06:48] <robertmaxrees> something like that is a little more in depth than I'd have time for right now.
[15:07:12] <jrbalsano> That's cool. It's a friday afternoon :P Do you think if I came back on another day there might be someone around who has time to help with that?
[15:07:28] <jrbalsano> I wasn't even sure if this was too absurd a request for an irc channel
[15:07:40] <robertmaxrees> eh, it's not really a constructive way to fix your problem imo.
[15:07:50] <robertmaxrees> unless you're just interested in the JQUI code itself.
[15:08:21] <jrbalsano> Well if it is a bug and I can find it I wouldn't mind reporting/patching. If its just the way I'm using it that's the problem it would be great to understand what that is
[15:08:26] <jrbalsano> But it is rather roundabout
[15:08:45] <robertmaxrees> reporting it would require a jsfiddle or jsbin demonstrating the bug.
[15:08:57] <jrbalsano> I've spent a lot of time trying to coax a JSFiddle to produce the weird scrolly behavior but to no avail
[15:09:14] <robertmaxrees> that usually means it's your site's css causing the issue.
[15:09:20] <jrbalsano> right
[15:09:39] <jrbalsano> but I'm new to a very large codebase
[15:09:52] <jrbalsano> and I don't know what angle to approach the problem to ask someone if they might have an idea what's causing it
[15:10:09] <jrbalsano> so my roundabout solution is to figure out the how and then try to reverse engineer the why
[15:10:25] <jrbalsano> >_<
[15:11:25] <robertmaxrees> i'd start by making sure your parent element positioning is all kosher.
[15:11:32] <robertmaxrees> go one level at a time.
[15:12:08] <ledestin> can’t find a plugin for favourite star, like on Gmail. Can’t believe it doesn’t exist
[15:12:25] <robertmaxrees> ledestin because it's so simple you could implement it yourself pretty easily :)
[15:12:32] <decx> it's just a checkbox with a label
[15:13:03] <jrbalsano> robertmaxrees: I'll give it a try and see where I get :)
[15:13:23] <decx> how come you go bye real name now duch
[15:13:26] <ledestin> decx: er, can you make checkbox look like a star?
[15:13:53] <decx> you dont make the checkbox look like a star
[15:13:55] <robertmaxrees> decx getting mod yesterday i guess.
[15:14:20] <decx> you use a label and hide the checkbox
[15:14:23] <robertmaxrees> i'd been meaning to for a while.
[15:14:48] <decx> you'll always be duch_kazatel to me
[15:14:58] <decx> i remember you, will you remember meee
[15:15:05] <robertmaxrees> ++
[15:15:24] <robertmaxrees> plus it makes me a little less curmudgeonly
[15:15:37] <ledestin> decx: ok. that’s interesting
[15:20:11] <jrbalsano> robertmaxrees: Looks like I stumbled on the problem - you were right. Though the earlier hours I spent trying to find a different work around make me want to believe the solution is more difficult :P Thanks for your help. I might be back though. There's a second component to the problem but I'll go fix this one first.
[15:20:27] <robertmaxrees> that's fine :) it's always simpler than you think.
[16:39:35] <phoenixsun> how do I use console.log() to test is a div is present?
[16:39:58] <systemfault> console.log($(selector).length);
[16:40:24] <phoenixsun> and any number other than zero is a good thing?
[16:40:54] <systemfault> Yup
[16:41:32] <phoenixsun> do I have to put the selector in inverted commas or anything?
[16:43:23] <systemfault> I don’t understand the question.
[16:45:05] <phoenixsun> if the div in questions has an id = 'play-button'
[16:45:10] <phoenixsun> is the code -> console.log((play-button).length) ?
[16:45:28] <systemfault> phoenixsun: You should learn CSS before jQuery :(
[16:45:36] <systemfault> It’s really important.
[16:46:24] <phoenixsun> probably
[16:47:27] <phoenixsun> CSS has never been an interest of mine but it is a necessity now
[16:49:45] <systemfault> phoenixsun: You can select ids with #
[16:49:56] <systemfault> So, in your case.. #play-button
[17:00:17] <robertmaxrees> yaaaay
[17:52:37] <tasaif> hey, when I do --> $(element).on 'click', some_callback <-- does the 'some_callback' have a pointer to the element?
[17:53:21] <tasaif> I tried using 'this', but that gave me a pointer to the window
[18:16:04] <drej> tasaif: $(this)
[18:16:05] <drej> should work
[18:16:21] <drej> you can also define it inside the callback first for a little bit of efficiency if you're going to use it more than once
[18:16:28] <drej> var this = $(this)
[18:16:36] <tasaif> are you enjoying this drej?
[18:17:07] * drej shrugs
[18:17:17] <tasaif> You're a funny guy lol
[18:17:29] <tasaif> I've narrowed down the issue
[18:17:42] <tasaif> for some reason, when I pass a parameter into the funtion, 'this' changes
[18:17:54] <tasaif> It might be because I'm defining my function poorly
[18:18:40] <drej> do ... you want me to chime in or not?
[18:19:41] <tasaif> that's up to you
[18:19:53] <tasaif> if you're curious, this is what it looks like http://hastebin.com/jonenokute.avrasm
[18:26:18] <tasaif> drej: thanks, the issue has been mostly resolved in #javascript
[18:26:39] <drej> cool , what was it out of curiosity?
[18:26:58] <drej> sorry i spaced out but off the top i didnt spot the coralation between what you pasted and the jquery part you mentioned earlier
[18:27:11] <tasaif> I was being stupid, I thought I was passing a pointer to the function, but I was accidentally invoking it
[18:27:28] <tasaif> Yea, I wasn't sure if I should post in jquery or javascript so I did both
[19:17:15] <madsy> If I want to apply an array of promises from jquery.getJSON() to jquery.when(), how do I resolve the json data from the then() callback?
[19:18:18] <aniasis> what would you recommend for an animation library?
