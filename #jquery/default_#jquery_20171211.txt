[04:19:20] <TheWild> hello
[04:19:54] <TheWild> how to perform some usual non-AJAX POST from a script? Chances that I can do it without creating <form>?
[04:27:41] <Cork> TheWild: you can't
[04:27:49] <Cork> either you need to use a form or you need to use ajax

[05:45:22] <bobdobbs> hi all. Im trying to understand this snippet: https://hastebin.com/ihusebutub.js
[05:45:31] <bobdobbs> from this page: https://api.jquery.com/jquery.getscript/
[05:45:45] <bobdobbs> On line 2, what does 'script' denote?
[05:54:12] <Cork> bobdobbs: it contains the content of the script requested
[05:54:18] <bobdobbs> thanks
[05:54:22] <iamarun> hello how to get the closest /tr ( i mean the closing  tag  )  then append to it
[05:54:25] <iamarun> something
[05:54:57] <Cork> iamarun: you don't
[05:55:07] <Cork> there are no closing tags in dom only in html
[05:55:22] <Cork> dom is a tree structure, elements has parents not wrapping start and close tags
[05:56:37] <Cork> iamarun: if you append an unclosed html string, dom error correction with auto close the element following the html specification for error corrections
[05:56:59] <iamarun> okay
[05:57:38] <Cork> so ex. '<p>something<p>something' becomes '<p>something</p><p>something</p>' before it gets converted to dom
[05:58:07] <iamarun> thanks
[05:58:14] <Cork> iamarun: that said, what are you trying to do?
[05:59:20] <iamarun> i have this table and when some one clicks on a td. i want to append a extra tr below the tr
[06:00:08] <Cork> iamarun: $(this).closest('tr').append($('<td>', { text: 'new element text' }));
[06:00:20] <Cork> this would be the button in this case
[06:00:32] <Cork> or what ever you click handler was on :)
[06:00:58] <Cork> append makes the element the last in the child list by default, so just append to the parent
[06:01:27] <iamarun> thanks its working. i need to just modify it more ...
[06:01:50] <Cork> iamarun: also a side note warning, be careful with appending raw html
[06:02:06] <Cork> you might expose your self to xss if the source can be modified by third parties
[06:02:48] <iamarun> thank you very much !
[06:03:49] <Cork> np
[06:14:38] <iamarun> cork , i copy pasted a tr row to append .... The thing is... iF whitespace are there javascript stops working ..if no whitespace it works well . Why is this
[06:14:40] <iamarun> ?
[06:18:20] <iamarun> https://pastebin.com/512EZLQq
[06:18:51] <iamarun> sorry! i am still learning if my questions are too beginner , my apologies
[06:20:07] <iamarun> is it possible to do the above with the curly brackets {} notation you mention earlier Cork ?
[06:26:26] <moveax> you need to concat new lines iamarun
[06:27:30] <moveax> iamarun: https://pastebin.com/9n6xpFtu
[06:27:40] <moveax> you can use ES6 Backtick notation too
[06:28:00] <iamarun> yes moveax !
[06:28:18] <iamarun> thanks
[06:32:12] <iamarun> $(this).closest('tr').append appends inside tr .....:C  os its like <tr>td td td <tr>/<tr> </tr>.... I want it to append it to the end of tr not inside
[06:32:29] <moveax> .parent
[06:32:44] <moveax> then append to table or tbody
[06:32:51] <moveax> depends on your markup
[06:34:13] <iamarun> well i have this table with monday , tuesday so on ...
[06:34:20] <iamarun> i want to append to
[06:34:23] <iamarun> monday
[06:34:55] <iamarun> how to get this
[06:34:59] <localh0st> iamarun: you are appending inside the selected element
[06:35:24] <iamarun> yes i want to append after monday  [ here ] tuesday
[06:36:35] <iamarun> where monday and [here ]  are part of monday
[06:37:24] <iamarun> i want < tr > </tr> < tr></tr> not tr tr /tr /tr
[06:37:36] <iamarun> in order ....
[06:37:49] <iamarun> i know programming concepts but my boss wants something ...:C
[06:37:54] <iamarun> he nags
[06:38:21] <iamarun> i know tree leaf node and things. But i am sorry to pester you guys about the result i want
[06:39:08] <iamarun> so is it possile ?
[06:43:32] <localh0st> iamarun: use .after
[06:43:35] <localh0st> $(this).closest("tr").after("<tr><td>here<td><td>new</td></tr>")
[06:47:22] <iamarun> thanks localh0st  its working !
[07:09:28] <lissitzki> hi, I've been asked to create a menu like this: http://www.irb-paris.eu, can you just give me some suggestion for taking a direction?
[07:10:33] <Cork> lissitzki: just looks like they have a timer delay on showing each element
[07:10:56] <Cork> (sad to say i think that menu looks kinda horrible...)
[07:11:48] <lissitzki> @Cork, yeah hope i can do better, If you have a better example I'll appreciate
[07:12:19] <Cork> well not if you want that ui structure; as THAT is what i thought was horrible
[07:12:26] <Cork> the code for it would be fairly simple
[07:12:34] <Cork> just a staggered showing of each entry
[07:13:53] <lissitzki> all in jquery, right?
[07:14:11] <Cork> you could do it in jquery or with native js should be fairly simple either way
[07:14:20] <lissitzki> I mean I have not a big experience, I'm trying to understand if I can start this work or not
[07:15:04] <lissitzki> How can i check the timer delay? my console is not showing it
[07:16:04] <lissitzki> thanks for your help @Cork
[07:21:44] <Cork> lissitzki: just a tiny example https://jsfiddle.net/v2pexoyg/
[07:22:31] <lissitzki> cool
[09:23:39] <jantje> hm. Why does .find("div[data-...) return an object, even though there was no match?
[09:24:25] <Cork> jantje: cause jquery selector functions ALWAYS return a jquery object
[09:24:29] <Cork> its a core feature of jquery
[09:24:42] <thykka> you can look into the .length of that object to see if matches were found
[09:24:53] <jantje> I see
[09:24:54] <jantje> Thanks
[09:24:55] <Cork> else things like $('').each would have to be wrapped in an if case to avoid it from crashing if it doesn't exist
[09:25:28] <jantje> ok, makes sense.
[09:25:54] <Cork> and this is what prototype did before jquery and why it was a mess ^^'
[10:22:15] <chrisml> anyone know why this doesn't copy "hello" to clipboard? using clipboard.js https://jsfiddle.net/70unwqch/
[10:25:11] <chrisml> lol cuz the input is hidden
[11:25:01] <dimi1947> on the window in the right of my screen,where it says at the top 1ops 429 total...what do I see beneath?...the names of the users connected?
[11:32:56] <Cork> dimi1947: what are you talking about?
[11:37:47] <dimi1947> I want to see if a specific user is on-line
[11:42:46] <Cork> dimi1947: /ns info <nick>
[11:49:51] <dimi1947> Cork:I cannot remember his username precisely...it is many charachters
[11:50:26] <Cork> dimi1947: if he was in this channel you can check the public logs
[11:50:56] <dimi1947> Cork:from where I can access these?
[11:51:08] <Cork> check the channel topic
[11:51:34] <marcisb> Is bower useful?
[11:52:01] <Cork> depends on your definition of useful
[11:52:16] <marcisb> For example what tools is useful
[11:52:17] <Cork> or one should possibly say depends on what you need solved
[11:52:25] <Cork> -_-'
[11:52:48] <dimi1947> Cork:channel topic...first time I hear that...from where I can see this
[11:52:49] <Cork> generically for javascript development i would say the only thing that is always useful is a text editor
[11:52:52] <Cork> the rest depends
[11:53:15] <Cork> dimi1947: it is usually listed above the chat log in the client
[11:53:26] <Cork> or you can request it again with /title #jquery
[11:53:55] <Cork> uhhh... /topic #jquery
[11:53:57] <Cork> -_-
[11:57:28] <dimi1947> where are these public logs
[11:58:02] <Cork> dimi1947: did you check what i just told you to check?
[12:00:07] <dimi1947> Cork:I do not see anywhere any reference to public logs
[12:00:28] <Cork> dimi1947: check the end of the message
[12:01:29] <dimi1947> Cork:yes I know what are you talking about...I clicked the link and nothing happens
[12:02:05] <Cork> dimi1947: well copy it to your browser if linking doesn't work
[12:05:37] <dimi1947> Cork:here is the situation...I copied it to the browser and the mail client...not suprized cause there is @ in that link
[12:05:50] <marcisb> for what purpose gulp is used?
[12:23:48] <xenaxon> hello all !
[12:23:50] <xenaxon> has anybody worked with fabricjs?
[12:42:48] <Levin^> hi there
[12:44:09] <Levin^> I'm still writing this code, but for now, I need to apply a css if the child elements have not a certain class
[12:44:12] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/opvaEQ?editors=1111
[12:45:07] <Levin^> which means, if you erase the class .current from the html, the other sibling divs should receive the background green from the jquery
[12:45:27] <Levin^> I'm sure I'm almost there
[12:49:55] <thykka> Levin^, like this? https://codepen.io/thykka/pen/PEYygP?editors=1111
[12:50:11] <thykka> (you had <div="container">, should've prolly been <div class="container">)
[12:50:39] <Levin^> thykka: yes, I just saw that!
[12:51:39] <Levin^> oh, you changed all the code
[12:51:41] <Levin^> hmmmm
[12:52:07] <thykka> yes, adding a class is better than adding inline styles
[12:52:23] <Levin^> I was going to add a class later though
[12:52:24] <thykka> also, i felt like .not(':has()') is a bit hard to grok
[12:52:51] <thykka> instead of "no .current? then this.."
[12:53:23] <Levin^> hm
[12:53:46] <Levin^> my finished element will have like five or six exchanging classes
[12:54:14] <Levin^> that's why I wanted it to check as few info as possible
[12:55:59] <Levin^> but you did a nice job there ;)
[13:43:09] <Levin^> hmm thykka
[13:43:52] <Levin^> this is my js: http://prn.stratlab.com.br/wp-content/themes/salient-child/js/scripts.js?ver=4.8.4
[13:44:34] <Levin^> the last but one is your code
[13:46:54] <thykka> heh, this is for a header menu that's "static" at first, but becomes sticky on scroll?
[13:47:05] <thykka> I implemented the same feature today at work :P
[13:47:14] <thykka> ..once again
[13:47:18] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:at last you are on line...remember me
[13:49:24] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 a bit.
[13:49:26] <robertmaxrees> sup?
[13:49:45] <dimi1947> what sup means?
[13:50:15] <robertmaxrees> short for "what's up"
[13:50:48] <dimi1947> First time I hear that....
[13:51:51] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[13:51:54] <dimi1947> anyway...can you remember what we were discussing about in friday?
[13:52:12] <robertmaxrees> vaguely.
[13:53:19] <dimi1947> ok...let me remind you
[13:53:38] <robertmaxrees> you were asking lots of basic JS questions.
[13:53:50] <robertmaxrees> much better format for the channel if you just ask questions heh.
[13:54:31] <dimi1947> we were talking about the filter method and the case where it accepts a function....and I was asking what i and e...as arguments are used for...
[13:55:08] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:55:13] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[13:55:28] <dimi1947> I had understand that the function needs these to access the element...and you said NO
[13:55:36] <dimi1947> remember?
[13:55:55] <Levin^> thykka: almost like that, yea lol
[13:56:37] <Levin^> can you inspect the sticky menu on http://prn.stratlab.com.br/ ?
[13:56:55] <Levin^> you will notice the menu is blank, it's normal right now
[13:57:15] <Levin^> but the class is not being added to the element :/
[13:57:38] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 vaguely.  did you have a question?
[13:57:50] <Levin^> (I know the html code is messy, I'm still working on it lol)
[13:58:20] <dimi1947> ok...q...does the function really need i and e?let us start with this
[13:58:44] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 that depends.
[13:59:01] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:on what
[13:59:09] <robertmaxrees> what kind of function you use.
[13:59:15] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vead8r71/
[13:59:43] <dimi1947> give me a second
[13:59:44] <robertmaxrees> you can use $(this) to access the element, but only within a normal function - $(this) won't work in an arrow function.
[14:00:00] <dimi1947> so an arrow function needs i and e???
[14:00:03] <robertmaxrees> yes.,
[14:00:35] <robertmaxrees> because arrow functions can't have their context bound - put differently, you can't set your 'this' the way you need to for jquery to make 'this' the element.
[14:00:48] <robertmaxrees> so you pass in i, e (or index, element) to access the element.
[14:01:27] <dimi1947> hmmm...I get it,anyway, https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/q4uy6p44/ line 78...it is an array function
[14:01:42] <dimi1947> arrow...I meant
[14:01:42] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:01:46] <robertmaxrees> oh, okay.
[14:01:57] <robertmaxrees> so what's the question?
[14:03:14] <dimi1947> that was question,as far as I can recall...just want to see if there is something else
[14:03:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:03:36] <robertmaxrees> "just want to see if there is something else" as in...?
[14:03:46] <dimi1947> so...
[14:04:26] <dimi1947> go to the fiddle that I gave you...
[14:04:31] <robertmaxrees> i did.
[14:04:33] <robertmaxrees> be specific.
[14:04:37] <robertmaxrees> i can't read your mind duder.
[14:04:48] <dimi1947> just a min to explain
[14:06:09] <dimi1947> go to the function...what is the purpose of it...to count the number of characters in the element/input?
[14:06:48] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[14:06:51] <thykka> Levin^, looks like you're cloning the menu on a scroll event handler, but trying to add the class on a load handler. Such an element does not exist at that point
[14:07:01] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 break it down to its component parts.
[14:07:09] <robertmaxrees> look at the body of the function
[14:07:27] <robertmaxrees> (i, e) => !e.value.trim() - this is what's getting passed to the filter
[14:07:37] <dimi1947> there ia a negation symbol
[14:07:42] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 correct.
[14:07:57] <robertmaxrees> are you confused about why that's there?
[14:08:00] <dimi1947> so tell me if I understand it correctly
[14:08:07] <robertmaxrees> you're close.
[14:08:15] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what that negation does?
[14:08:21] <robertmaxrees> in that particular case.
[14:08:40] <dimi1947> if number of characters not bigger that one...am I correct?
[14:08:57] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:09:08] <robertmaxrees> not zero.  which is subtly different.
[14:09:12] <Levin^> thykka: at what moment should I make the function run?
[14:09:31] <robertmaxrees> e.value will return a string.  .trim() removes any preceding/trailing whitespace.
[14:09:35] <Levin^> could I use the scroll event to also add the css?
[14:09:42] <dimi1947> I get it
[14:09:42] <robertmaxrees> that can result in an empty string, which coerces to false.
[14:09:51] <robertmaxrees> ! negates that check.
[14:10:00] <thykka> Levin^, umm.. not sure yet. Also, I was wrong, the element is not being cloned at load. Where and when are you cloning it?
[14:10:09] <dimi1947> so if number of characters zero..do this...
[14:10:17] <robertmaxrees> is NOT zero, do this.
[14:10:38] <robertmaxrees> and it's not counting a number of characters.
[14:10:45] <robertmaxrees> it's just checking for an empty string.
[14:11:04] <robertmaxrees> that looks like it's checking for empty inputs
[14:11:15] <dimi1947> if empty string do this...correct?
[14:11:19] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:12:37] <dimi1947> so it is not "is NOT zero"...
[14:12:55] <dimi1947> an empty string...is zero characters
[14:13:08] <robertmaxrees> it's not checking the lenght of the string tho.
[14:13:14] <robertmaxrees> it's checking if it's an empty striong.
[14:13:26] <robertmaxrees> i see where i mis-stated though.
[14:13:27] <Levin^> thykka: well, the clone comes from a wordpress plugin, so I'm not sure when the plugin fires itself
[14:13:34] <dimi1947> an empty string...is zero characters
[14:13:40] <thykka> Levin^, yes, i'm looking at the plugin's code now..
[14:13:46] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 the distinction is subtle but importnat.
[14:14:03] <robertmaxrees> you care more about the fact that the string is empty.  not the number of chars it has.
[14:14:18] <robertmaxrees> you're not checking string length at all.  you're checking if it's empty./
[14:15:13] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:yes but to check if empty...you must check string length
[14:15:18] <robertmaxrees> nope./
[14:15:26] <dimi1947> now I am confused
[14:15:31] <robertmaxrees> where in that code are you looking at the string length?
[14:15:53] <dimi1947> the length property
[14:15:56] <thykka> holy crap..
[14:15:56] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:16:01] <thykka> Levin^, this plugin is terrible
[14:16:10] <dimi1947> enlighten me
[14:16:23] <dimi1947> what length is doing there?
[14:16:23] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 the filter function itself is simply (i, e) => !e.value.trim()
[14:16:31] <robertmaxrees> there's no length check as apart of the filter.
[14:16:32] <thykka> Levin^, it's polling every 10ms. That's something no plugin should probably ever do
[14:17:02] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 there's a length check on the return of that filter call.
[14:17:16] <dimi1947> I GOT IT..the length property counts the number of inputs
[14:17:24] <Levin^> thykka: :(
[14:17:31] <robertmaxrees> *number of inputs returned by the filter, yes
[14:17:35] <thykka> Levin^, I don't think there's a good way to fix it. I mean, it's possible to monkey-hack something together, but it won't be pretty and it'll probably just lead to different problems
[14:17:43] <robertmaxrees> put differently, $('foo').filter(someFunction).length
[14:17:58] <dimi1947> that was very misleading
[14:18:03] <Levin^> thykka: I see.
[14:18:09] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 it's oddly written imo./
[14:18:20] <dimi1947> fortunately you pinpointed to me
[14:18:41] <robertmaxrees> it's doing a combo of both coercion and not.
[14:19:41] <dimi1947> when I was talking about zero chars and etc I was misleaded by that length property
[14:19:44] <thykka> Levin^, https://snag.gy/pS3nXz.jpg <-- this is the part that I find very concerning
[14:19:54] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/q4uy6p44/213/
[14:19:59] <robertmaxrees> this makes it a tad easier to read./
[14:20:28] <Levin^> hm
[14:20:45] <thykka> Levin^, "t" is the main function of the plugin, and it does a *lot* of things. This interval is set to run every 10ms, instead of, say, a scroll event where it would make sense..
[14:20:52] <Levin^> thykka: does that consume excessively some server resources?
[14:20:58] <thykka> not server, but client
[14:21:01] <robertmaxrees> scroll events can be even worse, fwiw.
[14:21:20] <thykka> robertmaxrees, worse than 10ms interval, for a scroll-related effect?
[14:21:38] <robertmaxrees> if not properly handled, yeah.  though they're both generally bad ideas.
[14:21:51] <robertmaxrees> scroll events fire much, much faster.
[14:21:58] <thykka> i mean sure, scroll events can be bad, but they can be throttled or run through requestAnimationFrame
[14:22:07] <dimi1947> I suppose your code is just demo...
[14:22:13] <robertmaxrees> ^ throttle/debounce and don't do anything too heavy
[14:22:24] <thykka> this plugin does the exact opposite
[14:22:27] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 what else would it be? just to illustrated a point.  probably doesn't work.
[14:22:32] <robertmaxrees> thykka :(
[14:22:39] <thykka> runs 100 lines of selector-heavy jquery code all the time
[14:22:45] <robertmaxrees> ew
[14:22:45] <robertmaxrees> ew
[14:22:54] <robertmaxrees> good luck on a phone hahahaha
[14:22:56] <Levin^> :(
[14:22:58] <dimi1947> ok...so the body if the function just tells...NOT having chars
[14:23:08] <Levin^> should I remove the plugin and make the code myself?
[14:23:12] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 bingo
[14:23:23] <dimi1947> THANKS...
[14:23:27] <robertmaxrees> Levin^ i'm late to the party, but what does this plugin do for you?
[14:23:33] <thykka> Levin^, yes, that would probably be better. Or look into some better plugin
[14:23:33] <dimi1947> case closed...
[14:23:38] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 though again
[14:23:47] <robertmaxrees> you wanmna think of it as "empty string"
[14:23:54] <robertmaxrees> because emtpy string is a falsy value in JS.
[14:23:54] <Levin^> robertmaxrees: clones any element to make it sticky
[14:24:02] <Levin^> in my case I'm cloning my main meny
[14:24:10] <Levin^> menu*
[14:24:14] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:anyway...
[14:24:26] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 that's a really important concept to wrap your head around.
[14:25:00] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:what are you trying to say...and in relation with that coded
[14:25:06] <robertmaxrees> empty string, 0, null, undefined, false, NaN
[14:25:36] <robertmaxrees> those are all falsy values.
[14:26:36] <thykka> Levin^, just for the sake of comparison, here's the main part of my implementation of the same effect https://snag.gy/5tz3k4.jpg – It does not even need to clone the element, just changes it from position: absolute; to position: fixed; and it works flawlessly in my use-case
[14:27:00] <dimi1947> ok...in this code is this any important what are you saying to me
[14:27:08] <robertmaxrees> yes.,
[14:27:24] <robertmaxrees> because it's important to understand the concept fully.
[14:27:27] <Levin^> thykka: please go check this page, sir: http://prn.stratlab.com.br/solucoes/comunicacao-corporativa/
[14:27:52] <Levin^> as you can see, the sticky menu gets the corrent page's branch
[14:27:58] <Levin^> current*
[14:28:19] <Levin^> that's why I'm having this whole trouble hehe
[14:28:31] <Levin^> let me check yours
[14:28:33] <dimi1947> ok..it is falsy...what next
[14:29:39] <dimi1947> you mean that this is the value returned from the function?
[14:29:41] <robertmaxrees> think of it this way: var foo = null, bar = undefined, baz = '';
[14:29:59] <robertmaxrees> what's the difference between those?
[14:30:07] <Levin^> hmm it looks like I could do the same effect if I added a special class when the user scrolls down a bit, that could change the menu entirely
[14:30:14] <dimi1947> none...I think
[14:30:32] <robertmaxrees> there's a big difference.
[14:30:37] <dimi1947> oh
[14:30:51] <thykka> Levin^, that stratlab.com page is eating 25% of my CPU even when idle
[14:31:03] <Levin^> thykka: hmm
[14:31:04] <robertmaxrees> the first two are obvious - one is null, the other is undefined, and one is an empty string.  none of them have characters.
[14:31:26] <robertmaxrees> hence why i keep pointing out that '' is "empty string"
[14:32:22] <dimi1947> confused again...
[14:32:24] <Levin^> is there a way to check which page elements/scripts are using the cpu?
[14:32:31] <dimi1947> what is the bottom line?
[14:32:47] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 null, undefined, and empty string are all distinct values.
[14:32:53] <robertmaxrees> Levin^ using chrome?
[14:32:56] <Levin^> yes
[14:33:01] <robertmaxrees> check out the profiler
[14:33:08] <thykka> Levin^, https://snag.gy/17jYc3.jpg
[14:33:21] <robertmaxrees> performance tab in your dev tools.
[14:33:22] <Levin^> robertmaxrees: thanks
[14:33:23] <thykka> click record, wait for a few whiles, click stop, inspect
[14:33:42] <Levin^> thykka: ok
[14:34:00] <Levin^> so as I saw here, scrolling events are bad for the cpu, right?
[14:34:17] <robertmaxrees> in general, yeah.
[14:34:20] <robertmaxrees> *event listeners
[14:34:21] <Levin^> what do people do to avoid that?
[14:34:40] <robertmaxrees> throttle/debounce the handler and be smart about what's happening inside the handlker.
[14:34:53] <robertmaxrees> don't do selections/modify as little DOM as possible,
[14:34:56] <Levin^> I see, needs more research about that matter
[14:35:58] <thykka> for the most part, a scroll event handler should do nothing :)
[14:36:00] <Levin^> per example, run the scroll event only if matches once?
[14:36:10] <Levin^> hmm
[14:36:14] <robertmaxrees> "matches once" is vague.
[14:36:37] <Levin^> yes, I need to read about event handlers and make some tests myself
[14:37:11] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4vu3wfm3/
[14:37:19] <robertmaxrees> here's a great example of things to not do.
[14:38:08] <thykka> keyword here is avoiding reflows and repaints
[14:38:18] <robertmaxrees> ^ as well as DOM access.
[14:39:27] <thykka> math operations are fast though, so if you cache your selectors, read as little from the DOM as possible and write to the DOM even less, then wrap it all within a RAF, it should be fine :P
[14:39:46] <thykka> here are some things to avoid https://gist.github.com/paulirish/5d52fb081b3570c81e3a
[14:40:45] <Levin^> I've seen those "modern" websites where your scroll down and lots of elements dances around the screen
[14:41:00] <Levin^> is that a clean example of performance killer?
[14:41:06] <thykka> not necessarily
[14:41:10] <Levin^> hm
[14:41:15] <thykka> CSS transforms are fast
[14:41:43] <thykka> a parallax can be implemented with CSS transforms alone, and that should be blazing fast
[14:42:02] <thykka> opacity changes are fast too
[14:42:03] <Levin^> hm
[14:44:55] <thykka> then again, premature optimization is a thing too.. Sometimes it's okay to animate a height in JavaScript. It might not be silky smooth 60fps, but if it's the only thing happening at that time, and it only lasts for a short while, people won't likely even notice
[14:47:18] <thykka> but in this case, you already have a whopping 70 different .js files and 44 .css files loaded.. It's bad for page load speed, and probably bad for general performance as well
[14:50:06] <thykka> many of those seem to be related to Visual Composer. This is just my opinion, but I don't think that plugin should even exist in the first place
[14:54:22] <Levin^> thykka: hmm I see
[14:56:23] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:goodnight
[15:36:01] <stan_man_can> Any good plugins for a wizard that has unique flows? as in, if the answer to A and B == $X then go to D, if the answer to B == $ then go to E
[15:48:18] <robertmaxrees> that's one of those things that wouldn't really be well suited to a jquery plugin imo.
[16:53:05] <greyboy> Hi I am new to Jquery. Has any one a good advice for me ??
[16:53:22] <catbadger> yes
[16:53:26] <catbadger> learn as much as you can.
[16:54:03] <greyboy> thanks I am doing it serious ;)
[16:55:09] <catbadger> yeah for real though, read as much as you can.
[16:55:31] <greyboy> catbadger: Now I am watching a tutorial of 1:14:25
[16:56:01] <catbadger> nice
[16:56:13] <catbadger> you might want to watch something on node-based projects.
[16:56:15] <robertmaxrees> greyboy check out the learning center
[16:56:19] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[16:56:22] <catbadger> i gotta go back and work now
[16:56:24] <robertmaxrees> and try.jquery.com
[16:56:38] <robertmaxrees> greyboy also: don't just do tutorials - build stuff.
[16:56:40] <greyboy> robertmaxrees: ok thanks
[16:57:44] <greyboy> robertmaxrees: yes after the most of new things I learn I get a scripts idea with jquery So I build a lot of stuff ;)
[16:58:14] <robertmaxrees> and learn plain javascript.  jquery is a shiny hammer - not every problem is a nail.
[16:58:20] <catbadger> YES
[16:59:22] <greyboy> robinsmidsrod: Yes but I am learning jquery after css and html .
[17:00:05] <greyboy> robinsmidsrod: so I learnt jquery before javascript because I am learning it to make a beautiful design.
[17:00:17] <robertmaxrees> jquery IS javascript ;)
[17:00:21] <greyboy> robinsmidsrod: But After it I will learn php and javascript a little bit deep ;)
[17:00:38] <robertmaxrees> bad autocomplete duder ;)
[17:00:52] <greyboy> robinsmidsrod: yeah lol
[17:01:12] <robertmaxrees> btw you keep pinging someone else heh.
[17:01:51] <greyboy> robinsmidsrod:  ???
[17:02:14] <robertmaxrees> that's not my username.
[17:02:55] <greyboy> robertmaxrees: lol I was wrong XD
[17:05:00] <greyboy> robertmaxrees: This may shock you, Of the intensity of my addiction, I can not watch a video of a programming language for more than 10 minutes without an application.
[17:05:49] <robertmaxrees> I wouldn't watch videos period tbh
[17:05:58] <robertmaxrees> but whatever works
[17:06:45] <greyboy> Yeah some times we need to watch videos with more than 1h !
[17:06:57] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:07:23] <greyboy> 1:00:00
[17:07:43] <robertmaxrees> i understand what an hour is
[17:07:47] <robertmaxrees> the statement seemed weird.
[17:07:49] <robertmaxrees> but whatevs.
[17:08:15] <greyboy> ok ;) sorry
[17:08:40] <greyboy> My native language is not english, that's why you can find errors in my syntax.
[17:10:14] <robertBusy> it's okay.
[17:11:58] <greyboy> wow look you can make the javascript sources of others Easy to understand. check this  : http://jsbeautifier.org/
[17:23:34] <robertBusy> you can just do that in your browser.
[17:54:40] <gambl0re> hello?
[17:55:12] <robertmaxrees> sup
[18:34:11] <kvoz> What is the proper way to make the browser automatically scroll to a certain row in a large table when the page loads?
[18:34:52] <robertmaxrees> use IDs.
[18:34:58] <robertmaxrees> and then use #theIdNameHere
[18:37:34] <kvoz> and then what? animate?
[18:37:45] <robertmaxrees> you don't have to do anything.
[18:37:50] <robertmaxrees> it'll jump to the ID automatically.
[19:14:51] <rjCousineau> Hello. I have a click event, but I want to not perform the click event if any children are clicked.
[19:15:34] <rjCousineau> The problem is, I'm binding to $(document), so if I try to use: if(e.target === e.currentTarget) return; it doesn't know the difference
[19:15:51] <robertmaxrees> mind showing us the code?
[19:16:30] <rjCousineau> sure
[19:16:41] <rjCousineau> 1sec
[19:16:55] <robertmaxrees> rjCousineau https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2q0dwrj0/
[19:17:02] <robertmaxrees> or is it just something like this?
[19:17:53] <rjCousineau> robertmaxrees: yes, except I don't want to see 'foo' when link is clicked
[19:18:06] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:18:10] <rjCousineau> to 'cancel' the parent's click event
[19:18:12] <robertmaxrees> so do you need that event to bubble?
[19:18:19] <rjCousineau> no
[19:18:23] <rjCousineau> wait
[19:18:23] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2q0dwrj0/1/
[19:18:24] <robertmaxrees> ezpz
[19:18:25] <rjCousineau> yes
[19:18:35] <robertmaxrees> why?
[19:19:00] <rjCousineau> I will try stopPropagation() on all children
[19:19:09] <rjCousineau> ty
[19:23:00] <rjCousineau> robertmaxrees: I need to bind click events for all the children elements that would be effected.  I was wondering if theres a way to not need to define the children's click events
[19:23:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:23:44] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to avoid?
[19:23:53] <robertmaxrees> 'cause you said you need to do a thing but you don't wanna have to do that thing lol
[19:24:05] <rjCousineau> 1 sec, fiddle.
[19:24:19] <kvoz> I have a select dropdown menu that I show/hide via jquery and everything works perfectly in chrome, but the menu automatically closes as soon as I expand it in Firefox. If I hold down my left mouse button and drop it on my selection I can get around the problem, but thats pretty annoying. Anyone experience something similar?
[19:24:53] <robertmaxrees> kvoz hard to know without seeing a test case/.
[19:26:50] <rjCousineau> robertmaxrees: not a working fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/2q0dwrj0/2/ but you see, I'm looking that when <select> is clicked, the 'foo' doesn't fire
[19:27:02] <kvoz> robertmaxrees, dont think I am able to show a test case unfortunately. Was just thinking that maybe someone had had a similar problem
[19:28:46] <robertmaxrees> rjCousineau so why can you use my suggestion?
[19:28:50] <robertmaxrees> *can't
[19:30:02] <rjCousineau> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/2q0dwrj0/5/
[19:30:23] <rjCousineau> because I dont want to bind click events.  I'm using a select to demonstrate i'm only binding 'change' events
[19:30:40] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2q0dwrj0/6/
[19:30:43] <robertmaxrees> what about this?
[19:32:06] <rjCousineau> robertmaxrees: yes that works
[19:32:21] <robertmaxrees> aight.
[19:32:40] <rjCousineau> I've realized, some children are not current, that I still want the click to fire. I suppose, only CERTAIN children i want to stopPropagation().  I guess it's back to binding click events for each special child
[19:33:00] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:33:05] <robertmaxrees> you can check for classes.
[19:33:10] <rjCousineau> with e?
[19:33:14] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[19:33:29] <robertmaxrees> e.target and e.currentTarget are DOM nodes.
[19:33:40] <robertmaxrees> so you can do $(e.target).hasClass() or w/e
[19:33:46] <rjCousineau> e.className
[19:33:52] <rjCousineau> oh nice too!
[19:33:58] <robertmaxrees> *e.target.className
[19:34:04] <rjCousineau> ty
[19:34:07] <robertmaxrees> the event object isn't a DOM node.
[19:34:13] <rjCousineau> oic
[19:34:14] <robertmaxrees> target and currentTarget are.
[19:34:23] <rjCousineau> ok
[19:38:54] <rjCousineau> robertmaxrees: Your solution worked! thank you very much :)
[19:39:22] * rjCousineau is in great debt to robertmaxrees for his fountain of knowledge
[19:40:44] <robertmaxrees> haha
[19:40:49] <robertmaxrees> just been around the block a few times.
[19:46:12] <stan_man_can_> Is there any event available for "classes changed" ?
[19:46:32] <stan_man_can_> aka if a class is added/removed from something
[19:47:14] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[19:47:22] <robertmaxrees> why would you want to know that?
[20:38:12] <graingert> stan_man_can_: mutation observer
[20:38:17] <graingert> stan_man_can_: but why
[20:38:43] <graingert> stan_man_can_: use a model to render the classes
[20:38:48] <graingert> And update the model
[20:39:00] <graingert> Then instead of listening to class updates
[20:39:08] <graingert> Listen to model updates
[21:06:14] <rhizome> graingert: got any url or search terms for that?
[21:06:54] <graingert> rhizome: ?
[21:07:16] <rhizome> just curious about the technique
[21:10:43] <rhizome> kinda forgot what channel i was in, but 'jquery model' helps
[21:10:48] <rhizome> "nm"
[21:21:09] <graingert> rhizome: yeah it's not really a jQuery way
