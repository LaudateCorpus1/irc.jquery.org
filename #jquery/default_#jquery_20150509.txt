[03:52:12] <uskerine> jquery rocks
[04:23:11] <dtekind> hi guys ,  is there a way to get the current selected option with mutiple select
[04:32:42] <arthurvr> uskerine: oh yes it does :)
[04:32:56] <arthurvr> dtekind: maybe create a fiddle/jsbin?
[04:47:00] <dtekind> arthurvr: http://jsfiddle.net/re8tevoc/20/ it alway return the first option in the order
[05:08:53] <moya> How do you handle a string with both single and double quotes in it? I'm trying to do something with the reddit JSON API, but a typical page contains both single and double quotes, e.g. http://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/top.json
[05:09:18] <moya> JSON.parse() throws an error, but so does just trying to store the response in a variable
[05:10:26] <decx> dtekind:  selects have a property called selectorOptions, you can loop through that and map it out into a value array
[05:10:38] <decx> selectedOptions even*
[05:12:04] <dtekind> decx: thanks for your response , could you tell me where I can add this property , here is the diddle http://jsfiddle.net/re8tevoc/20/
[05:12:40] <decx> first of all, i suggest you use console instead of alert
[05:14:32] <decx> dtekind: http://jsfiddle.net/decx/re8tevoc/31/
[05:14:37] <decx> here's a headstart
[05:17:55] <dtekind> decx: thanks but the issue that I have , I want to get the right order of the selected value , for example if I select 1 and two I get ["1", "2"] but if I select two then one I should get ["2", "1"]
[05:18:07] <dtekind> this the main issue I do have :(
[05:18:49] <decx> that's weird
[05:19:04] <decx> your event should probably be on the option then
[05:19:20] <decx> and everytime one is clicked it gets added into a var
[05:22:04] <decx> i just realized that jquery .val() already outputs multiple values :>
[05:22:16] <decx> so you dont actually have to loop :>
[06:12:38] <Tyeth> Hi, are the # links broken still as they were in 1.1 in jquerymobile?
[06:13:19] <Tyeth> and could they not just rewrite ui elements with #.original
[06:13:48] <Tyeth> just the thoughts of a mad stoner...sorry if unwanted
[06:19:16] <decx> arthurvr may have the answer
[06:24:06] <pauled> Hello here. Please forgive me if my question look stupid ^^  Why I can't delay() on alert() like this: alert("Hello World!").delay(5000);
[06:27:36] <Tyeth_> thanks decx, i got disconnected, if theres a chance you can paste it his way I'd be ever so grateful
[06:30:17] <decx> i did it again, thought arthurvr was arschmitz :>
[06:30:28] <decx> sorry for the highlights ^^
[06:30:55] <arschmitz> decx: are you looking for me or arthurvr?
[06:31:12] <decx> there was a question about jqm
[06:31:22] <decx> and i saw arthur active a few hours ago
[06:31:38] <decx> lo and behold i mixed up the names again :>
[06:31:55] <arschmitz> ok
[06:32:13] <arschmitz> decx: what was the question are they still here
[06:32:45] <decx> this is the moment where i curse the absense of quits in my client but i don'T think so
[06:33:21] <decx> <f'Tyeth> Hi, are the # links broken still as they were in 1.1 in jquerymobile?
[06:34:43] <arschmitz> decx: ok well have them ping me if they come back
[06:34:54] <arschmitz> and are still looking for hellp
[06:35:17] <decx> and i won't be doing ar<tab> without looking ;)
[06:55:54] <dtekind> decx: can you explain plz
[07:07:00] <decx> dtekind what do you mean?
[07:07:10] <decx> oh right the select
[07:07:44] <dtekind> decx: how I can the correct order of the selected value
[07:07:56] <decx> let me look at it
[07:08:00] <decx> what was it
[07:08:04] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/re8tevoc/20/
[07:08:29] <decx> ok let's save the order that things are clicked in some data()
[07:10:08] <dtekind> I want when I select second option then first option get something like this ["2", "1"]  instead of ["1", "2"] http://jsfiddle.net/re8tevoc/46/
[07:10:46] <dtekind> decx: how I can save that order :(
[07:39:40] <jb0t> struggling to understand why event delegation is failing for me. if i set a breakpoint just prior to the jquery.on  the selector is found.  the child target does not exist yet.
[07:40:06] <jb0t> at this point, the delegation fails to find the child target after the child is dynamically populated later on.
[07:40:33] <jb0t> if i perform the bind after the child has been rendered, the delegation DOES work.
[07:40:50] <jb0t> both of them, using the same selector targets
[07:41:36] <jb0t> there are intermediate children that are also not yet rendered. but i wouldn't think that to be the problem
[07:46:07] <jb0t> i can get it to work if i place the event binding inside another event binding that is triggered when the data fragments are rendered,  but this is terrible because my elements get a new event binding with every firing of the outer event.. which is grid page loading. so potentially tons of unnecessary binding
[07:48:22] <_HelpNeeded> is there any way to track the which arc was clicked in this http://cssdeck.com/labs/canvas-wavey-particles-motion
[07:50:09] <_HelpNeeded> FFs sm1 help :P
[07:57:13] <decx> dtekind: still there?
[07:57:24] <dtekind> decx: yes
[07:57:26] <decx> i had some cake and looked at the problem
[07:57:32] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/re8tevoc/47/
[07:57:45] <dtekind> decx: thanks buddy let me check
[07:59:13] <dtekind> decx: seems working fine .:D
[07:59:23] <dtekind> let me try your solution
[08:09:48] <Jeroen1> Does anyone know how to add infoboxes using this? http://pastebin.com/L4HeGVqM
[08:14:14] <unnu-mobile> Cork, you around?
[10:06:22] <Audioburn> can someone help me understand why my ints become undefined? http://jsfiddle.net/g2zn5qho/11/
[10:16:37] <shoky> Audioburn: read the paragraph in $.extend docs starting with "The merge performed by $.extend() is not recursive by default"
[10:17:01] <edong23> hi. Let me start by saying straight up that i am a noobie. so, here goes.   Im using .getJSON to grab some json data and then passng that to a function which calls .each on that and uses the keys to update divs with the id of the key with the value for that key. and it works.
[10:17:11] <Audioburn> shoky, oh wow
[10:17:18] <Audioburn> shoky, so what should I do?
[10:17:29] <drej> PANIC
[10:17:33] <drej> k
[10:17:33] <Audioburn> lol
[10:17:44] <edong23> however, i then want to take the values of those keys individually by using v.<key> and do some math with them.
[10:17:49] <edong23> the values are always numbers
[10:18:12] <uskerine> definitively moment.js is worth
[10:18:14] <edong23> but when i try to use the firefox developer console and pull the data out, i get 3 responses for v.<key>
[10:18:20] <edong23> 2 undefined and one with the actual value
[10:18:36] <edong23> does anyone know why this would be?
[10:18:40] <uskerine> how do you set a given time? so I would like to get today with moment() but then asign 14.00 instead of current time
[10:30:34] <edong23> uskerine: with jquery + new Date().getTime()
[10:32:24] <uskerine> thanks edong23 but I was looking for this: moment().hour(14).minute(00).seconds(00).millisecond(00);
[10:33:09] <edong23> uskerine: sorry, i dont know moment..
[10:34:26] <uskerine> it is really useful
[10:36:01] <andywww> seems like it would be a fairly obvious thing to fix but has anyone had problems with fading in and out divs of content on chrome?
[10:36:22] <andywww> i was to fadeOut, run a .html(new_stuff) then .fadeIn()
[10:36:39] <andywww> i’m doing the html and fadeIn in the fadeOut’s callback
[10:36:48] <andywww> its working perfectly in firefox
[10:36:52] <edong23> i do something similar and odnt have issues... what is the issue?
[10:37:00] <edong23> is it not fading? or is it slow choppy?
[10:37:13] <andywww> first time, it’s fading okay
[10:37:45] <andywww> but if i click the action to do the fade again, it goes slightly bold
[10:37:51] <andywww> then just disappears
[10:37:59] <edong23> bold?
[10:38:01] <edong23> hm...
[10:38:03] <edong23> show code?
[10:39:14] <andywww> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4f494a82ee9785417a9c
[10:39:19] <andywww> this is correct, isn’t it?
[10:40:03] <andywww> bold like there are two lots of the content layered on top of eachother
[10:41:16] <andywww> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a69bd563657aa8bbf472
[10:41:32] <andywww> that is the function that calls it
[10:44:18] <edong23> andywww: no idea...
[10:44:50] <edong23> im doing somethign similar, but im using $(this).empy and then $(this).append
[10:44:55] <edong23> should be nearly the same
[10:45:22] <edong23> chrome is awful though
[10:45:23] <edong23> lol
[11:57:28] <looky> good evening everyone =)

[12:20:38] <NBhosting> what could cause my .checker not to respond on onclick http://93.158.222.150/backgammon/25/
[12:20:41] <NBhosting> $(".checker").on("click", function () {
[12:20:43] <NBhosting> it fails to trigger that
[12:21:36] <Uhkis> NBhosting: your html has huge errors in it, fix them first
[12:21:45] <NBhosting> wich errors?
[12:22:09] <Uhkis> id="checker" is duplicated soooo many times
[12:22:20] <NBhosting> ah that was a test idd, removed them
[12:22:45] <NBhosting> f5
[12:23:18] <Uhkis> so where is that line
[12:23:18] <NBhosting> somehow it just doesnt respond to .checker
[12:23:27] <NBhosting> sex let me look the line
[12:23:29] <NBhosting> sec
[12:24:05] <NBhosting> mainpage source
[12:24:10] <NBhosting> i seperated it for testing
[12:24:25] <NBhosting> tried both # and .
[12:24:31] <Uhkis> ah it's dynamic
[12:25:24] <Uhkis> $('.bg--content_div').on('click', '.checker', function() { ... });
[12:25:39] <NBhosting> ah it needs the parent?
[12:26:09] <Uhkis> since the checker elements arent there when the event is bound, yes
[12:26:17] <NBhosting> ah k
[12:27:30] <NBhosting> can i do the same on $(".checker").draggable({
[12:28:49] <Uhkis> not sure
[12:30:32] <NBhosting> cant i do something liek $('.bg--content_div .checker')
[12:36:35] <Uhkis> you need to call draggable() on the element after you've created it
[12:36:52] <NBhosting> k let me try

[14:40:27] <javalover> not trying to spam but my friend ChessWhiz is streaming coding a game right now please check it out love you all : http://www.twitch.tv/chesswhiz
[14:50:33] <holyfukbud> can javascript do everything?
[14:50:58] <Palmer11> if you put your mind to it
[14:51:10] <Palmer11> and clap your heals 3 times
[14:51:25] <holyfukbud> could you write a chatroom on purely Js, node.js and html+Css?
[14:51:40] <Palmer11> should be able to
[14:51:59] <rawrmonstar> look at socket.io a chatroom is their example app
[14:52:20] <DragonPunch> holyfukbud: I wrote one from scratch and it's pretty sophisticated.
[14:52:35] <holyfukbud> no you didn't scribear stfu
[14:52:43] <DragonPunch> holyfukbud: Wait what?
[14:52:54] <holyfukbud> lets see how sophisticated it is
[14:52:57] <holyfukbud> show it to daddy
[14:53:28] <DragonPunch> Omg, your such a tool.
[14:53:41] <holyfukbud> lets see it
[14:53:43] <DragonPunch> Going to go back to code.
[14:53:49] <holyfukbud> where is this sophisticated chatroom you wrote?
[14:54:05] <rawrmonstar> o.O
[14:54:32] <holyfukbud> what about the scalability of socket.io
[14:54:58] <holyfukbud> lets say I wanted to have a chatroom with 1,000 users actively chatting. would socket.io be moreso suited to that type of scalability or does it fold like a bitch?
[14:55:12] <jb0t> socket.io is the client side portion
[14:55:38] <Palmer11> it should be able to contain itself
[14:55:50] <holyfukbud> what about 10,000, what is that scalability dependent upon?
[14:55:55] <Palmer11> yep
[14:56:11] <Palmer11> its not the socket.io you would need to worry about
[14:56:22] <Palmer11> its of your server can handle an higher amount of requests
[14:56:23] <holyfukbud> what do I need to worry about
[14:56:35] <jb0t> node. orbited.  whatever you use.
[14:56:52] <jb0t> they can handle 10's of thousands of clients on minimal hardware
[14:56:56] <Palmer11> just don't cheap out on a server if you are looking for a high traffic rate
[14:57:05] <rawrmonstar> you could have multiple instances of node if you expect a ton of clients
[14:57:22] <holyfukbud> well the thing about socket.io is the instantenous connection im curious about.
[14:57:24] <rawrmonstar> and just communicate accross the instances with socket
[14:57:28] <holyfukbud> what is this irc room written in
[14:58:23] <holyfukbud> how many sockets does a server have, and does 1 person occupy 1 complete socket, or can 10 people occupy one socket
[14:58:40] <rawrmonstar> 1 client per socket
[14:58:50] <rawrmonstar> is my understanding anyway
[14:59:04] <jb0t> go read about  epoll and kpoll
[14:59:34] <DragonPunch> holyfukbud: No, unlimited number of people can occupy one socket. It just depends on your hardware/kernel specifications.
[15:00:10] <jb0t> uh. no
[15:00:42] <DragonPunch> Uh. Yes.
[15:01:08] <DragonPunch> . For example, let's say a single machine wants to support 64,000 simultaneous connections. If the server uses 1MB of RAM per connection, it would need 64GB of RAM. If each client needs to read a file, the disk or storage array access load becomes much larger than those devices can handle.

[15:01:23] <DragonPunch> don't link me ur shitty wordpress blogs.
[15:01:55] <DragonPunch> jb0t: i already read this crap like 2 years ago.
[15:02:22] <DragonPunch> jb0t: these are only in extreme cases and like i said. you have to fine tune the kernel.
[15:02:28] <DragonPunch> and have good hardware.
[15:02:35] <DragonPunch> it's not 'complex'
[15:02:48] <holyfukbud> hey Dpunch
[15:02:53] <DragonPunch> what
[15:02:54] <holyfukbud> lets do some fucking work
[15:03:38] <DragonPunch> dude, if you want to be my operations guy.
[15:03:45] <holyfukbud> I do want to be your operations guy
[15:03:48] <DragonPunch>  you have to do shit. not just complain like a little bitch.
[15:03:49] <holyfukbud> thats what I fucking do
[15:03:52] <DragonPunch> all the time.
[15:04:14] <holyfukbud> it's i dont
[15:04:22] <holyfukbud> ok lets go to work
[15:04:27] <DragonPunch> okay.
[15:09:40] <gtwy> so much angst

[17:34:11] <holyfukbud> big daddy is back in the house
[17:34:22] <shoky> Jeroen1: it's because by the time the event listener callback is called, the for loop has already ended long ago, and i === locations.length.  don't use for loops, use locations.forEach(function(location, i) { ... })  instead
[17:35:20] <shoky> Jeroen1:  alternatively you can put a function scope inside the for loop:   for (var i = 0; ...) {  (function(i){ .... })(i)  }
