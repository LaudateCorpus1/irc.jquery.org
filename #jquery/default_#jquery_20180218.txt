[08:43:43] <EoN> I have a form which has 2 submit buttons with the same name, eg <button type="submit" id="save" name="submitAction" value="Save"> <button type="submit" id="activate" name="submitAction" value="Activate"> .  then on the server side i'm able to determine which was clicked. but if i want to use jquery  to submit this form, how do i control which one is 'clicked' or passed to the server ?
[14:58:51] <WeiJunLi> whats the jquery version with more critical vulnerabilities?
