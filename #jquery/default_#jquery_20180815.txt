[00:53:40] <devish> can anyone help me in converting https://pastebin.com/dm5zBs1U to jquery
[00:55:08] <devish> this is part of tag plugin but since it is in php I cannot use it in my project (java +js+jquery)
[01:00:04] <Woet> devish: what have you tried so far?
[01:03:04] <devish> Woet: sadly my knowledge of php is limited to downloading and using them
[01:03:18] <Woet> devish: so whats the plan?
[01:03:26] <devish> if you can tell something than it would be useful
[01:03:36] <devish> starting point
[01:03:42] <Woet> devish: learn PHP.
[01:04:14] <devish> PHP guys says its jquery
[01:04:31] <Woet> the pastebin you linked is PHP.
[01:05:57] <devish> yeah I know
[01:06:14] <Woet> devish: so, if you want to convert that to jQuery, you'll need to learn PHP.
[01:06:40] <devish> Till now what I understand is, this gets input from user entry and then search from source
[01:07:27] <devish> and displays the list of matched name
[01:59:26] <devish> Woet: https://pastebin.com/z2npWKYq
[01:59:37] <devish> I have got it till here
[02:00:13] <devish> K is giving me index number V is giving me value
[02:00:58] <devish> is there a way I can get here what user has entered in box, so I can search words starting with that
[02:31:33] <devish> Woet: got it finally
[04:48:01] <spinningCat> anyone know about amc chart here?
[06:25:18] <Hackwar> hi folks, I have a list of items and on desktop I hover over them and a slide comes up with some data. on mobile, I'm checking for a class (touch-open) and only if that is present, I'm allowing the default behavior (click). However, I'm doing that on touchstart and that also prevents scrolling... Anybody an idea what I could do?
[07:36:47] <spinningCat> is there any plugin for showing popup to use for  like confirm, warning, delete, submit ? Any plugin suggestion?
[07:47:24] <AdamPDotty> Are you looking for modal?
[08:47:27] <spinningCat> AdamPDotty,  yeah modal
[08:48:10] <spinningCat> similar to this https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/42592/screenshots/920254/delete_bookmark_2.0.png
[08:52:29] <diverdude> can i somehow set my textarea up to consume a stream of data?
[08:56:57] <spinningCat> yeah why not
[08:57:11] <spinningCat> is it camera stream?
[08:59:50] <diverdude> spinningCat: well no its actually a stream of text coming from a serial port
[09:00:06] <spinningCat> ah okay
[09:00:25] <spinningCat> could you sucesfully store in a string or something?
[09:00:30] <spinningCat> in backend
[09:01:06] <spinningCat> the only thing you need to do is to get that stream from backend to frontend
[09:01:14] <spinningCat> but i am guessing it is really big data
[09:01:27] <spinningCat> did you store that data in database?
[09:34:56] <diverdude> spinningCat: its infinite data...sooo
[09:35:20] <spinningCat> hmm
[09:35:30] <spinningCat> so i guess keep that in file is better option
[09:35:43] <spinningCat> anyway you just send request to function with ajax
[09:35:58] <spinningCat> and return that stream in json format
[09:52:12] <memelover> Hi, I'm trying to use the getJSON function, but this generates an XML parsing error in my browser. Why would this be? Is it trying to read it as XML?
[09:52:28] <spinningCat> what is status code?
[09:53:04] <memelover> Everything seems to be loading properly, but I'm getting this error in the console: "XML Parsing Error: not well-formed"
[09:53:22] <memelover> The location is that of the json file
[09:53:34] <spinningCat> if it is parsing error
[09:53:44] <spinningCat> well there is a mismatch on format
[09:53:59] <spinningCat> the data format in backend and format you expect is dfferent
[09:54:01] <memelover> But I'm not trying to load it as xml
[09:54:10] <spinningCat> JSON?
[09:54:14] <memelover> Indeed
[09:54:27] <spinningCat> did you convert xml to json in backend?
[09:54:40] <memelover> No, I'm dealing only with a json file
[09:54:56] <spinningCat> you have xml in json file?
[09:55:10] <memelover> No, I don't
[09:55:36] <spinningCat> okay i think you cannot get xml as json without doing some convert
[09:55:57] <memelover> Well I'm not trying to!
[09:56:05] <memelover> I'm not using XML at any point
[09:56:14] <memelover> But the console complains about an XML parsing error
[09:56:19] <spinningCat> but the error is about xml
[09:56:41] <spinningCat> well then frontend expect xml for some reason
[09:57:05] <spinningCat> what is the status code ? is it 200 pr 500?
[09:57:07] <spinningCat> or*
[09:57:29] <memelover> I'm getting a 200, but when I try to read from the json, that appears in the log
[09:57:35] <memelover> I'll figure it out on my own
[14:29:12] <reynierpm> hi there, I am wondering how good is to do the following for remove an attribute from a bunch of elements among a page
[14:29:15] <reynierpm> $('#field_type_id, #field_name, #field_seq, #selected-drug, #reset_question, #submit_button, #insert_after, #delete_question, #selectAll').removeAttr('disabled')
[14:29:27] <reynierpm> is there a better way to achieve the same?
[14:29:35] <taplar> if they had a common class, you could use that
[14:29:38] <robertmaxrees> they look like a bunch of inpu.
[14:29:42] <robertmaxrees> what taplar said.
[14:29:52] <robertmaxrees> or just $('#someparent input');
[14:30:29] <reynierpm> thx I didn't think on add a custom class to all of them and use it, thanks taplar robert
[14:30:35] <taplar> also removeAttr will not affect things that are disabled programatically
[14:30:53] <taplar> it will only affect things that started off as disabled in the markup on load
[14:31:08] <taplar> you should use prop('disabled', false)
[14:31:09] <reynierpm> taplar, they are disabled by default but if it was not the case what should I use instead?
[14:31:26] <reynierpm> taplar, gotcha thanks I will change it to that to avoid future issues
[14:31:34] <taplar> good deal
[14:38:27] <Qiller> hi guys, how can i force close window using javascript?
[14:38:48] <taplar> you can do window.close() but you can't really force it
[14:39:07] <taplar> afaik
[14:39:25] <Qiller> =\
[14:39:47] <Qiller> Scripts may not close windows that were not opened by script.
[14:39:52] <Qiller> rly sad
[14:39:54] <reynierpm> does any here has some experience with jqgrid-free?
[14:39:57] <rindolf> Hi all! How do I install https://github.com/kugaevsky/jquery-phoenix/ using bower?
[14:39:58] <reynierpm> *by any chance
[14:40:00] <taplar> it's the users browser.  not yours.  it's within their control to keep windows around
[14:40:19] <Qiller> sure
[15:43:12] <taplar> sloooooooow
[15:51:07] <diverdude> I have a string which is ascii encoded with eg. \r\n etc.I need to convert that into html understandable tags, ie. <br/> instead of \r\n etc. How do i do that in jq?
[16:03:29] <rindolf> diverdude: hi
[16:03:51] <rindolf> diverdude: use a regex and then .html(...)
[16:04:09] <diverdude> thx
[16:04:16] <rindolf> diverdude: but see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting
[16:04:43] <taplar> you can use text() to avoid some XSS concerns
[16:05:13] <dobbler31> Out of the blue, my Google Distance Matrix ajax call is pending for an average of 40 seconds.. I was using file_get_contents() but switched to cURL, now it's not timing out but it's still taking around 40 seconds.. Not even sure if this is the right channel but if anyone can shed some light.. Thanks
[16:05:17] <dobbler31> It's working fine on my local server and when I hit the api url directly. Only has a problem on the production server so the service is working and all quotas etc. are good (unlimited pay as you go account).
[16:06:01] <taplar> dobbler31: sounds like you need ##javascript.  it doesn't sound like you are doing jQuery with that logic
[16:06:40] <taplar> also if a cURL is still taking 40 seconds, that sounds like an endpoint issue, thats not going to be a javascript issue
[16:06:55] <taplar> endpoint/network
[16:13:46] <diverdude> rindolf: what about htmlescaped strings like this: %0D%0AGrbl%201.1f%20%5B%27%24%27%20for%20help%5D%0D%0A%5BMSG%3ACheck%20Limits%5D%0D%0A%5BMSG%3A%27%24H%27%7C%27%24X%27%20to%20unlock%5D%0D%0A     How can I return those to normal using js?
[16:14:01] <diverdude> *jq
[16:14:31] <robertmaxrees> *js ;)
[16:14:56] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURI
[16:15:24] <robertmaxrees> or https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURIComponent
[16:17:59] <diverdude> robertmaxrees: hmmm ok....it does not seem to be able to handle %24 which is '$', nor %3A which is ':'
[16:19:17] <diverdude> ahhh decodeURIComponent did it
[16:19:21] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:19:29] <diverdude> thx m8

[22:44:13] <hexdj> hi
[22:44:45] <hexdj> I need to know if an element is a descendant from a class
[22:46:34] <hexdj> but it's not necesarily an immediate descendant
[22:47:35] <hexdj> <div class="shiz"> <div class="x"><input type="text"></div></div>
[22:47:51] <hexdj> I tried something like this:
[22:47:59] <hexdj> self.element.on('keyup change', 'input[type=text]:parent("col-sm-9"):not([readonly]):first', function....
[22:48:24] <hexdj> everything works, except for the parent portion
[22:49:10] <hexdj> I think parent only works for direct parents/children elements
[22:51:29] <pavonia> $(".shiz").on("keyup change", "input[type=text]", ...), if I understand correctly
[22:54:36] <hexdj> that's not the part I need to change
[22:55:14] <hexdj> I need it inside this notation: ('input[type=text]:parent("col-sm-9"):not([readonly]):first
[22:57:46] <ngharo> you could rewrite it like: $('.col-sm-9').on('keyup change', 'input[type=text]')
[22:58:00] <hexdj> I can't touch the first portion, it's from a backend
[22:58:13] <Woet> lol.
[22:58:51] <ngharo> it sounds like you should do the validation inside the event handler, not the selector
[22:59:40] <hexdj> self.element.on('keyup change', 'input[type=text]â€™ function () { U MEAN HERE? )}
[22:59:45] <ngharo> yes
[22:59:51] <hexdj> ok cool
[23:00:54] <ngharo> if ( $(this).closest('.col-sm-9').length ) { // im a descendant of .col-sm-9 }
[23:02:11] <hexdj> does length have to equal something?
[23:02:46] <pavonia> Not 0
[23:03:03] <ngharo> a length of 0 is falsey, but yeah you should probably be explicit and check that !== 0
[23:06:05] <hexdj> actually I need to find out a way to do it in the original statement
[23:06:35] <hexdj> because if I do it after, some fields can give me a 'true' and still not be the field I want
[23:08:04] <ngharo> not sure i understand
[23:08:22] <hexdj> so I wrote this:
[23:08:39] <hexdj> self.element.on('keyup change', 'input[type=text]:not([readonly]):first',
[23:08:39] <hexdj>             function () {
[23:08:39] <hexdj>                 if ($(this).closest('.shiz').length) {
[23:09:22] <hexdj> the first portion can be true for fields that check all those properties, but they're not inside a .shiz container
[23:09:46] <hexdj> so I am not targeting the one I am intending
[23:10:12] <ngharo> thats what the if condition is for
[23:10:30] <hexdj> see I am targeting the first item
[23:11:15] <ngharo> i guess you could just do: '.shiz input[type=text]:not([readonly]):first'
[23:11:19] * ngharo barfs
[23:11:35] <ngharo> its generally bad practice to get crazy with selectors
[23:11:43] <ngharo> afaik
[23:11:51] <ngharo> they're not very performant
[23:12:06] <ngharo> you can accomplish that all inside the handler in a clear to read way
[23:12:56] <ngharo> if a handler fires and it's not what you want, then just return out of the function before doing any work
[23:14:23] <hexdj> isn't that basically the same?
[23:16:25] <hexdj> this does exactly what I need self.element.on('keyup change', '.shiz input[type=text]:first', function () {
[23:16:27] <hexdj> thanks!
