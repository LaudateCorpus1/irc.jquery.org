[00:14:28] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:16:15] <mukeka> What's up with this? Am trying to remove the option where value is equal to currentSelected. http://pastebin.com/w6teLsfE It returns Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: select option[value=option1]
[00:16:34] <mukeka> or #selectMail option[value=option1]
[00:18:41] <_rgn> #selectMail option[value="option1"]
[00:21:47] <shwackd> Can somebody please tell me what I'm doing wrong here? http://pastebin.com/tUGdJ2GV
[00:22:30] <fabioportieri> what's the error
[00:22:39] <shwackd> I'm not getting a response
[00:22:59] <shwackd> but navigating to http://wdcticker.com/api/ticker gives jSON
[00:23:13] <fabioportieri> and in the net panel of dev tools?
[00:24:15] <shwackd> i'm kind of a novice. I don't have any other information other than what I'm trying  - that is to make the alert() show me the price.
[00:24:39] <shwackd> It seems like what I have should work
[00:24:41] <fabioportieri> shwackd: use firebug or chrome dev tools to see the response you're getting
[00:24:49] <shwackd> i have firebug one sec
[00:25:53] <shwackd> says GET http://wdcticker.com/api/ticker 200 OK 456ms but it's red
[00:26:05] <MJCD> ;o
[00:26:23] <fabioportieri> shwackd: click the response subpanel
[00:26:29] <shwackd> it's blank
[00:26:59] <fabioportieri> is it another domain from your host?
[00:27:08] <shwackd> it's an external domain is that why?
[00:27:12] <fabioportieri> then you should use jsonp for cross domain ajax
[00:27:16] <fabioportieri> yes
[00:27:26] <shwackd> ok thank you very much!
[00:27:40] <fabioportieri> no prob you're welcome
[00:27:45] <shwackd> I'll give that some readind and let you know how it went if you're still here
[00:27:46] <MJCD> er
[00:27:52] <MJCD> what does jsonp have to do with cross-domain? :/
[00:27:58] <MJCD> the p just means padding
[00:28:49] <MJCD> ahh I see
[00:28:59] <MJCD> a 'hack' for sites that dont allow cross-origin
[00:29:02] <MJCD> tsk tsk ;o
[00:29:35] <shwackd> i rmeember this
[00:29:54] <shwackd> i feel like a dummy now thank you so much
[00:59:08] <umje> I am unable to trigger a click event on a checkbox, I've tried this 	$('.new-list').on("change", function() { }); and only a click event. Is there something special with checkboxes?
[00:59:50] <fabioportieri> that is a on change event (change occurs when losing focus)
[01:00:21] <umje> $('.new-list').click(function() { }); does not work either.
[01:01:56] <umje> funny really
[01:02:03] <fabioportieri> works here
[01:02:12] <umje> all other elements work's just fine with the click
[01:02:14] <umje> the checkboxes, no.
[01:02:18] <fabioportieri> paste your code umje

[01:04:13] <umje> simple as it can get
[01:04:32] <fabioportieri> umje: your selection is wrong
[01:04:45] <fabioportieri> no sorry
[01:04:46] <fabioportieri> nvm
[01:05:47] <umje> works in IE
[01:05:49] <umje> :p
[01:05:51] <umje> not chrome
[01:05:58] <fabioportieri> ah
[01:06:06] <fabioportieri> in ff works fine
[01:06:26] <fabioportieri> in chrome too
[01:06:33] <fabioportieri> i guess your issue is elsewhere
[01:06:39] <umje> http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1525-jQuery-s-Event-Triggering-Order-Of-Default-Behavior-And-triggerHandler-.htm
[01:07:57] <fabioportieri> that is unrelated to your issue
[01:08:10] <umje> damn, I need to show a div when checked
[01:09:10] <fabioportieri> umje: if you try your code in jsfiddle you will see the code runs fine so your issue is elsewhere
[01:09:59] <umje> I fail to see how this simple script can fail
[01:10:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: you up
[01:12:31] <fabioportieri> umje: because it doesn't
[01:13:19] <umje> I think I know what it is lol
[01:13:25] <umje> "Block any more popups from this webpage"
[01:14:11] <umje> how do I allow them again?
[01:14:27] <fabioportieri> browser options
[01:14:33] <umje> yeah Got it
[01:14:34] <umje> :p
[01:46:16] <enoch> hi all, and merry christmas
[01:46:55] <enoch> and now a little question: how to wait for ajax content to be fully loaded before show it?
[01:50:07] <aolko> hey there
[01:51:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> aolko: hey
[01:59:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> quick question
[01:59:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> one can make their own tag
[01:59:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> and style it
[02:00:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> using css right
[02:00:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> for exmaple
[02:00:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> styling
[02:00:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> <toy></toy>
[02:00:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> other than the fact that html in later version might use that tag at a later point
[02:01:47] <aolko> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6164000/how-can-i-create-my-own-html-tag ?
[02:03:22] <aolko> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2802687/is-there-a-way-to-create-your-own-html-tag-in-html5
[02:07:41] <MJCD> aolko, Rohan_Bhangui: in HTML5 this workflow is called web components
[02:07:54] <MJCD> which are bound to change the way pretty much everything is developed, given some time
[02:08:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> MJCD: thanks
[02:08:19] <MJCD> have a great weekend everyone !
[02:32:12] <UWSnl> hi, I'm having some issues with a strange bug
[02:32:33] <UWSnl> I've been building a JQuery plugin, which has been going well and all, but suddenly I ran into something small
[02:33:12] <UWSnl> I have this variable, $(table), which contains a table -> tbody -> (multiple) tr, -> (multiple) td
[02:33:49] <UWSnl> now when trying to do a $(table).find('tr'), it simply returns prevObject instead of the children
[02:34:42] <Aamir> UWSnl: create a fiddle to explain your problem plz
[02:35:33] <UWSnl> while when I define the variable outside of the plugin, and thus override the variable, I can call the same query in the console, and then it DOES work
[02:36:27] <UWSnl> and also. when I simply log table[0] in the console, I will also get my table and all it's children, so it's not that I don't have 'no results'
[02:36:42] <UWSnl> Aamir: It's kinda hard to create a fiddle, since the script is huge
[02:37:10] <UWSnl> it's a framework with the company I'm working with, and i'm not really doing any stunts
[02:37:13] <Aamir> UWSnl: not sure you will get any help for this much info :/
[02:38:32] <UWSnl> I'll see if I can reproduce the issue
[02:47:42] <UWSnl> basically, it comes down to this, if I do two logs directly underneath eachother
[02:48:02] <UWSnl> the first one (console.log(table)) returns the jquery object, and that innerhtml shows the table's html
[02:48:20] <UWSnl> the second one (console.log(table.children())) returns a prevObject, with no results.
[02:48:36] <UWSnl> same goes for a find, and even table.html() returns blank/nothingness
[02:58:29] <belea> some docs on pagination? i never worked with jquery and have no clue :-<
[03:04:00] <_rgn> google?
[04:01:26] <bigbugjava> hi I get this: ArrayBuffer is deprecated in XMLHttpRequest.send(). Use ArrayBufferView instead.

[04:47:13] <Armistice> how to match?
[04:47:15] <Armistice> in what sense
[05:18:18] <shafox> Hi I have several grid like input box with class name input1, but while submitting the input value , i cant get the value. It always search in the first input field which is empty and return emptry string . How to search for like which input field has value in it ??
[05:18:45] <shafox> I have tried var content = $(".input1").val();, and also if(var content = $(".input1").val().lenght)
[05:18:48] <shafox> etc etc
[05:22:44] <BinaryKitten> shafox
[05:22:55] <shafox> BinaryKitten, yes
[05:22:56] <BinaryKitten> are all the inputs .input1?
[05:23:02] <shafox> yes
[05:23:12] <BinaryKitten> then you'll need to use .eq
[05:23:18] <BinaryKitten> ?.eq @ shafox
[05:23:30] <BinaryKitten> hmmm i miss that old bot
[05:23:59] <Joeywoey> hey BinaryKitten
[05:24:22] <BinaryKitten>  if(var content = $(".input1").val().length) will always be "true" since it's doing the assignment in the if
[05:24:25] <BinaryKitten> hey Joeywoey
[05:24:31] <shafox> BinaryKitten, so that would be $('.input1').eq().val(); ???
[05:24:45] <BinaryKitten> .eq(itemnum)
[05:25:00] <shafox> that i dont know .
[05:25:12] <BinaryKitten> $('.input1').eq(1).val(); for the 2nd item with class of .input1
[05:26:24] <shafox> can i pass other than integer in the eq ??
[05:27:37] <BinaryKitten> no
[05:27:43] <BinaryKitten> has to be an int
[05:27:51] <BinaryKitten> what would you like to pass?
[05:28:17] <shafox> the div id is something dynamic so though of passing the div id that is unique and will get the value
[05:28:33] <BinaryKitten> lol
[05:28:38] <BinaryKitten> if you have the id
[05:28:39] <BinaryKitten> then use that
[05:28:49] <BinaryKitten> $('#the_id').val();
[05:29:29] <shafox> BinaryKitten, http://jsfiddle.net/mZWqL/
[05:29:32] <shafox> this is the html
[05:30:52] <BinaryKitten> eek
[05:30:58] <BinaryKitten> what puts the : in thos ids
[05:32:20] <shafox> BinaryKitten, its from a phpreservation code. google it you will find in code.google.com
[05:32:34] <shafox> those are splitted latter to get the time etc etc
[05:35:10] * BinaryKitten hates code that messes with ids like that
[05:35:20] <BinaryKitten> when will people learn ids are not for data
[05:36:49] <shafox> BinaryKitten, I cant do anything.
[05:37:08] <shafox> I wanted to rewrite the whole thing, but the boss said no use that .
[05:37:09] <shafox> :(
[05:37:18] <BinaryKitten> shafox can you update your paste with more html
[05:37:25] <BinaryKitten> might be able to come up with something
[05:38:12] <shafox> BinaryKitten, http://jsfiddle.net/mZWqL/1/
[05:38:35] <shafox> you will get the idea what i am trying to do .
[05:38:41] <BinaryKitten> ok
[05:38:53] <shafox>  I just wanted that input text adn run through the database and then return back the result
[05:38:55] <BinaryKitten> so, you're trying to submit just the value from the box above the submit
[05:49:38] <shafox> BinaryKitten, yes
[05:51:49] <BinaryKitten> shafox http://jsfiddle.net/mZWqL/2/
[05:52:01] <BinaryKitten> use the submit button as you starting reference
[05:57:12] <shafox> BinaryKitten, problem is this selects the whole table.
[06:00:02] <BinaryKitten> urm no
[06:00:15] <BinaryKitten> oh wait
[06:00:31] <shafox> BinaryKitten, selecting the table wont do. have to be document
[06:01:14] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/mZWqL/3/
[06:01:33] <BinaryKitten> because the table is injected via js?
[06:01:45] <shafox> yes
[06:02:45] <BinaryKitten> ok
[06:03:06] <shafox> its not working.
[06:03:08] <shafox> :(
[06:03:46] <donmatthew> I'm working on a phonegap app but I can't get my javascript to scroll down to the bottom of the page. Any ideas? It works good on desktop but ain't working on my phone

[06:08:03] <shafox> I didnt know that
[06:42:29] <kuni> Hi, I am experimenting with jquery-mobile. So far I have a working example with three connected pages. But somehow when I change pages, I can't get a back button, which according to the book I have, should be generated automatically. Any hints on what I can do here? Tried adding data-add-back-button and data-rel="back" attributes, didn't work.
[06:45:12] <DevAntoine> what's the difference between e.which and e.keyCode?
[06:45:20] <DevAntoine> (where e is the event object)
[06:49:37] <kuni> DevAntoine: http://api.jquery.com/event.which/ should be of help to you
[06:51:09] <krambiorix> hi, in a dialog i have a save button... After saving, the dialog closes automatically...But while saving, the user can click the button multiple times so it saves multiple times... How can i make sure the user can only save one time in this dialog?
[06:51:55] <Velveeta> krambiorix: in your click handler for the button, you need to disable the button state also, and on success, not only close the dialog, but also reenable the button for the next time the dialog is opened
[06:54:25] <krambiorix> Velveeta, how can i disable thestate?
[06:54:54] <aolko> hey velveeta
[06:55:09] <Velveeta> those buttons should be declared as button ui widgets i'm pretty sure, being a part of a ui dialog widget, so you should be able to just do $(selectorPathToYourButton).button('disable')
[06:55:10] <aolko> so, let's continue
[06:55:12] <Velveeta> hey aolko
[06:55:24] <Velveeta> let's not, i have a busy morning ahead of me that i'm about to get started on
[06:55:43] <Velveeta> but there are plenty of qualified people in here that can help you continue down that path, you don't need just me to help with this
[06:56:35] <DevAntoine> thanks kuni
[06:58:35] <Velveeta> aolko: whatever questions you have about the current state of your application, throw them out into the channel in general and see who picks them up to help you with them… also, jsfiddle examples are much more preferable than pastebins, so be forewarned that you're probably going to be asked to generate some fiddle examples before people want to help you
[06:59:03] <aolko> we stopped together with now issue
[06:59:16] <aolko> yesterday
[06:59:20] <Velveeta> i know
[06:59:28] <Velveeta> so throw your question out into the channel for someone to help you with it
[06:59:38] <Velveeta> i'm about to be gone for about half the day, so i'm unavailable
[06:59:57] <aolko> so how do i fix it?
[06:59:59] <Velveeta> and like i said, make a jsfiddle demo out of it so they can see what you're talking about, and see the current behavior of it
[07:00:15] <Velveeta> you fix it by either figuring it out yourself, or asking a question here in the channel for someone to help you with
[07:00:18] <aolko> i sent a you a link
[07:00:25] <aolko> to a working site
[07:00:35] <Velveeta> i know you did, what part of this are you not understanding
[07:00:49] <Velveeta> i am about to be *gone*, you cannot rely on me to solve all of your problems
[07:00:53] <aolko> after two refreshes now records are gone, why?
[07:00:54] <Velveeta> throw your questions out into the channel
[07:01:01] <Velveeta> i'm done responding now
[07:01:04] <BillCriswell> aolko: Jesus christ dude.
[07:01:28] <aolko> what?
[07:04:25] <dex5> how to get 3rd word onwards in a string?
[07:05:18] <BillCriswell> dex5: 'foo bar baz buzz'.split(/\s+/).slice(2).join(' '); should do it.
[07:05:27] <BillCriswell> If you want a string returned as well.
[07:05:44] <dex5> thanks
[07:08:14] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[07:18:48] <Velveeta> phew, billpay and emails and facebook finally knocked out
[07:44:17] <dman777_alter> I am trying to use the datetime picker widget from http://tarruda.github.io/bootstrap-datetimepicker/ but the icon seems to be missing.
[07:44:30] <dman777_alter> should <i data-time-icon="icon-time" data-date-icon="icon-calendar"> </i>
[07:44:57] <dman777_alter> be included in the bootstrap-datetimepicker.min.css or bootstrap-datetimepicker.min.js?
[08:46:24] <sonotos> hi is der a shortcut for   $('#id').attr('data-custom', $('#id').attr('data-custom' )+string); like appendToAttribute? did not find any in the docu, just wanted to ask before i create on on my own
[08:47:58] <BillCriswell> sanova: You can do $('#id').attr('data-custom', function(i, oldDataCustom){ return oldDataCustom + string; });
[08:51:14] <sonotos> BillCriswell: i meant an existing method in jquery :-)
[09:02:28] <BillCriswell> That is existing.
[09:02:33] <BillCriswell> sonotos: ^^
[09:03:13] <sonotos> oh, ok whats the name of this method?
[09:03:29] <BillCriswell> .attr()
[09:03:40] <BillCriswell> Just with a different second argument.
[09:05:31] <sonotos> ah ok, i see  thx
[09:12:00] <wtfitsme> Hello - first day with jquery so please excuse my ignorance ;)... I am trying to use find with like: $('ul.nav').find('a[href='window.location.href]').parent().addClass('active'); but alas I get "SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list" - I know this most be a quoting issue but I can't get it right.
[09:12:42] <BillCriswell> wtfitsme: Lots of issues here.
[09:12:54] <wtfitsme> i bet :)
[09:13:08] <BillCriswell> The nesting is off, and you need to use concatenation to get a javascript variable into selector.
[09:14:00] <BillCriswell> I'd personally use this approach: $('.nav a').filter(function(){ return this.href === location.href; }).parent().addClass('active');
[09:14:35] <BillCriswell> To do it your way though, you can do: $('ul.nav').find('a[href="' + window.location.href '"]').parent().addClass('active');
[09:15:31] <wtfitsme> ahh so thats a double quote around single quotes?
[09:15:45] <wtfitsme> i see...thanks!
[09:16:07] <BillCriswell> You don't need the quotes at all unless there's some like odd characters in there.
[09:16:27] <wtfitsme> got it, thanks - very helpful!
[09:24:21] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[09:26:47] <nicholasschulz> how can i blur everything behind the lower-opacity div in white? http://bannaky.com/merken/?test=1
[09:29:03] <duch_kazatel> nicholasschulz by using css filters.
[09:29:08] <systemfault> There's no way to do it with CSS, really hard to do with javascript on recent browsers, impossible with older ones.
[09:29:23] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter
[09:29:35] <nicholasschulz> ok. so theres no cross-browser thingy that makes it possible?
[09:29:45] <duch_kazatel> there is a way with CSS, but it's not fully cross-browser as of yet.
[09:29:51] <nicholasschulz> if it doesn't work on most browsers, i won't do it…..
[09:29:57] <systemfault> Not at all, actually... blur is expensive on the CPU :/
[09:31:00] <duch_kazatel> systemfault it is possible, but not currently a very good idea :)
[09:31:20] <systemfault> duch_kazatel: Yeah... CSS filters with chrome, svg filters with others.
[09:31:26] <nicholasschulz> i haaate technological constraints :-(
[09:31:35] <systemfault> But.. they blur the element itself, not what's underneath
[09:32:01] <systemfault> So.. you would need to play with copy of elements... blur them.. place then with JS... etc..
[09:32:07] <Germanaz0> hello
[09:32:14] <nicholasschulz> the only way google told me is by using js...
[09:32:31] <duch_kazatel> what was the js technique?
[09:33:30] <nicholasschulz> http://jsfiddle.net/kmxD3/1/
[09:33:35] <nicholasschulz> duch_kazatel
[09:34:06] <duch_kazatel> wait do you want a blurry effect or just a transparent effect?
[09:34:24] <systemfault> He said blurry
[09:34:27] <nicholasschulz> blurry AND transparent
[09:34:28] <duch_kazatel> oooh nvm i see it - that's CSS buddy
[09:34:32] <nicholasschulz> i have the transparent
[09:34:35] <duch_kazatel>     -webkit-filter: blur(.25em);
[09:34:43] <duch_kazatel> that only works in safari and chrome.
[09:34:48] <nicholasschulz> is that cross-browser compatible?
[09:34:49] <nicholasschulz> ok
[09:35:07] <nicholasschulz> any way to make it cross browser?
[09:35:08] <duch_kazatel> the -webkit- prefix is your clue there, but that doesn't use javascript for the effect.
[09:35:10] <systemfault> You can use SVG filters for firefox
[09:35:22] <nicholasschulz> most of the population still use IE, if I'm not misinformed?
[09:35:50] <systemfault> nicholasschulz: Depends on the website... But around a third on "normal websites"
[09:36:06] <nicholasschulz> k systemfault
[09:36:11] <duch_kazatel> nicholasschulz actually, Chrome is far more popular than you'd think.
[09:36:25] <nicholasschulz> trying to make a website for 'normal' people
[09:36:31] <duch_kazatel> http://gs.statcounter.com/
[09:37:43] <duch_kazatel> IMO target chrome, FF, and IE9+ and you're solid.
[09:38:07] <duch_kazatel> my company includes 8 in that list for now, but that's slowly changing.
[09:41:24] <nicholasschulz> includes 8 what=
[09:41:38] <duch_kazatel> IE8.
[09:41:43] <Lann> argh. How to pass data to a $.ajax success callback but also get the ajax response? Syntax seems impossible to google for this
[09:41:55] <duch_kazatel> Lann have any sample code?
[09:43:30] <Lann> duck_kazatel: https://gist.github.com/minusreality/34a276c243b2b082d39b
[09:43:31] <duch_kazatel> Lann the basic idea is to include the .success() method call like this - .success(function(returnedData) {}) - you can name "returnedData" whatever you want, but that's the info that came back.
[09:43:58] <systemfault> Lann: That way of setting callbacks is pretty much dead.
[09:44:05] <Lann> ok
[09:44:12] <systemfault> It's old and inflexible...
[09:44:15] <Lann> does that success callback have DOM_ITEM in scope?
[09:44:23] <Lann> I mean, without passing it
[09:44:33] <systemfault> Lann: Yes
[09:44:37] <Lann> oh ok
[09:44:44] <systemfault> With JS, you have access to the outer scopes
[09:44:44] <Lann> in that case heh, issue must be elsewhere
[09:44:48] <Lann> i though tso
[09:44:58] <Lann> but my code wasnt working so i started doubting that
[09:45:19] <systemfault> But seriously... learn of to use the promise-based interface.. a lot more powerful
[09:45:25] <systemfault> (For $.ajax)
[09:45:49] <Lann> within my ajax callback i run this
[09:46:11] <Lann> item.parents('.vendor-wrapper').find('.purchase-bindle-link').attr('data-immediate-checkout-url', response);
[09:46:16] <duch_kazatel> Lann don't do that - $.ajax({
[09:46:17] <duch_kazatel> 	type: 'get',
[09:46:17] <duch_kazatel> 	data: 'data=lol',
[09:46:17] <duch_kazatel> 	url: 'http://aurl.com',
[09:46:17] <duch_kazatel> 	dataType: 'json',
[09:46:17] <duch_kazatel> }).success(function(urDatalol) {
[09:46:17] <duch_kazatel> 	console.log(urDatalol)
[09:46:18] <duch_kazatel> })
[09:46:24] <Lann> heh
[09:46:25] <duch_kazatel> woops totally didn't mean to paste that in the channel.
[09:46:37] <systemfault> o_O
[09:46:45] <Lann> i think that statement i just pasted runs outside of the ajax calback but not in it
[09:47:40] <duch_kazatel> Lann that... doesn't make any sense.  you can define a function that takes the returned data as an argument and then call it from within the success callback.
[09:47:41] <Lann> oh interesting, i should be using .success? tell that to the entire team on this project
[09:48:06] <duch_kazatel> i mean, you can define it the other way, but that's kind of weird.
[09:48:15] <Lann> i'll be sure to start using it
[09:48:28] <duch_kazatel> heh - I'd check to see why they do it that way.
[09:48:38] <duch_kazatel> don't override standard unless you have a good reason to.
[09:49:02] <Lann> i have a long standing question to you JS folks. How do you stop jquery from failing silently all the time?
[09:49:13] <Lann> I mean …trying to think of an example
[09:49:27] <duch_kazatel> like when it doesn't find a match for a selector so it just gives up?
[09:49:35] <Lann> yeah that and the other million reasons
[09:49:42] <Lann> and then it stops executing your JS with no log message
[09:49:57] <duch_kazatel> wait what?  it shouldn't just fully stop O.O
[09:50:19] <Lann> ugh, i never have an example handy
[09:51:07] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you have another issue.
[09:51:10] <Lann> like if you try to use an undefined variable
[09:51:32] <Lann> I think it occurs if you try to do $(undefined).something
[09:51:59] <duch_kazatel> it shouldn't silently fail on you.
[09:52:02] <Lann> it does
[09:52:10] <Lann> but i dont have time to make an example atm
[09:52:30] <Lann> well, more like it's 3am and i'm too tired too
[09:53:01] <duch_kazatel> you mean something like this?
[09:53:01] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/uuSSg/1/
[09:55:21] <Lann> http://jsfiddle.net/uuSSg/2/
[09:55:53] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/maTzwXn.png
[09:56:01] <duch_kazatel> that definitely throws an error for me >.>
[09:56:26] <Lann> god damn it hahaha
[09:56:30] <Lann> ok fine i dont have an example handy
[09:56:37] <duch_kazatel> encaught exceptions are a helluva thing.
[09:56:53] <Lann> i mean the thing that makes me end up debugging with console.log
[09:57:03] <Lann> because it stops running my jquery code without a log message
[09:57:36] <duch_kazatel> not sure what scenario you're talking about.
[09:57:58] <duch_kazatel> but you should definitely learn about how to step through your code with a script debugger.
[09:59:31] <Lann> i really should
[09:59:39] <Lann> what do you use for that?
[09:59:51] <duch_kazatel> firebug.  chrome's debugger works well, too.
[09:59:55] <duch_kazatel> IE has one, as well.
[10:00:11] <Lann> step debuggers?
[10:00:15] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[10:00:20] <Lann> how did i not know this
[10:00:43] <duch_kazatel> what browser do you normally use?
[10:00:46] <Lann> chrome
[10:00:57] <duch_kazatel> yeah, check out the "sources" tab in the dev tools then.
[10:01:45] <duch_kazatel> allows you to setup breakpoints, see the call stack, etc.
[10:01:55] <Lann> omfg, the number of things i could have solved with this is sad
[10:02:12] <Lann> thanks!
[10:02:14] <duch_kazatel> hahaha i take it you're familiar with how to use a debugger?
[10:02:27] <Lann> yeah
[10:02:33] <Lann> i just didnt even know one existed for javascript
[10:02:47] <Lann> actually, nobody i even have developed with did
[10:03:06] <duch_kazatel> hah!  yep - that's one of the things Firebug introduced that everybody said "why didn't we think of that?!"
[10:03:26] <Lann> woot
[10:03:28] <Lann> new toys
[10:04:28] <duch_kazatel> chrome also enables some pretty neat options for things like linking to files on your hard drive and editing them directly.
[10:05:05] <Lann> heh i'm such a slow adopter. I'm even using netbeans
[10:05:16] <duch_kazatel> hah.  welcome to last century :)
[10:05:19] <Lann> it honestly works well for me for most things
[10:05:32] <duch_kazatel> i used notepad++ for the longest time for the same reason.
[10:05:49] <Lann> netbeans works well for me in multiple languages and such
[10:05:53] <Lann> except the occaisional memory leak
[10:07:05] <Lann> sometimes being a freelancer can let you put yourself into some messed up situations. I have to complete like 40 hours on this project before the 2nd
[10:07:24] <Lann> doable, but an annoying pace to code at when i'm used to taking it easy
[10:08:04] <Lann> thats what i get for dicking around all month
[10:08:17] <duch_kazatel> hah.  c'est la vie, though, no?
[10:08:25] <duch_kazatel> and we just got done with the holidays.
[10:08:29] <Lann> pretty much
[10:08:43] <Lann> my usual routine is to take a week off at the beginning of the month
[10:08:52] <Lann> that was such a bad idea this month with the holidays
[10:09:03] <duch_kazatel> hah, i bet.
[10:09:30] <Lann> anyways, i shouldnt even be chatting heh, back to finishing this damn checkout system
[10:10:23] <duch_kazatel> good luck - those are always the worst.
[10:11:15] <Lann> especially this one, because it's a checkout system that aggregates multiple vendor's checkout systems
[10:11:27] <Lann> and not necessarily with their permission
[10:12:03] <Lann> it's slightly gray hat, but hey i'm just a damn freelancer
[10:13:39] <duch_kazatel> oooh... good luck there - that's got PCI issues written all over it.
[10:14:06] <Lann> well not really because they dont accept credit cards
[10:14:44] <Lann> in the end it's just a reseller comparing multiple vendors and letting you click purchase then populating the remote vendor's cart in cases where their cart can be manipulated to do so
[10:14:51] <duch_kazatel> ah
[10:15:13] <Lann> some even have iframes set to origin heh…we have workarounds
[10:15:27] <Lann> sketch known browser issues in JS
[10:15:46] <duch_kazatel> yup - I'm aware of that.  i work in ecommerce ;)
[10:16:10] <Lann> heh yeah you can still hit a remote url that does not allow iframes using a timed delay and a popup
[10:16:16] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[10:16:38] <Lann> hey user, ignore this little popup, ok…everything's good now. nobody saw anything
[10:17:42] <Lann> i bet people like bestbuy will be shocked to hell if they find out what we've done
[10:17:53] <Lann> their cart is super secure
[10:18:10] <Lann> i dont see why people dont use tokens for adding to cart, that'd more or less stop me
[10:18:22] <duch_kazatel> it'd probably piss them off, too, because you're circumventing everything that enables them to track end users.
[10:18:23] <Lann> only like 1 out of 30 vendors so far had real security measures
[10:18:35] <duch_kazatel> they're a very... unique company though.
[10:18:54] <Lann> yeah, every project is just some guy with a bunch of money trying to get rich online
[10:19:00] <Lann> i just build what they ask
[10:19:03] <duch_kazatel> hah
[10:19:54] <Lann> what's even more funny is when they use tokens and put the tokens in their page and you can scrape and re-use them because they arent properly checked
[10:20:00] <Lann> i dont DO that, but some were vulnerable to it
[10:20:02] <duch_kazatel> yup
[10:20:10] <Lann> but i cut those because that could possibly allow a lawsuit
[10:20:41] <Lann> i'm pretty sure just adding products to a cart with the user's permission is not exactly illegal it's just gray
[10:21:19] <duch_kazatel> eeeeh.... like I said you're circumventing all their tracking mechanisms, which might get them into hot water with their brands.
[10:21:26] <duch_kazatel> because they don't have reliable data any more.
[10:21:44] <Lann> yeaaah but in this companies case there are like 500 vendors
[10:21:50] <Lann> so if one gets really mad, that doesnt even matter
[10:21:54] <duch_kazatel> they can't close the loop and say "folks searched for your stuff x amount of times and wound up on these 3 products the most, but ultimately bought x instead"
[10:22:13] <duch_kazatel> depending on the industry, that can be very problematic.
[10:22:17] <Lann> yeah i understand that they wouldnt want it
[10:22:30] <Lann> like i said, that's what makes it gray but i dont think it's illegal or anything
[10:22:44] <duch_kazatel> might not be illegal, but it might be against their TOS ;)
[10:23:06] <Lann> i think that just means they can ban
[10:23:10] <duch_kazatel> has your client considered working with these companies to do the comparison shopping?
[10:23:22] <Lann> yes, he's trying to negotiate with each of them
[10:23:25] <duch_kazatel> they can also send a cease and desist/sue you.
[10:23:26] <Lann> this is a temporary measure
[10:23:30] <duch_kazatel> in that case - milo.com
[10:23:34] <duch_kazatel> there's your product data :)
[10:24:21] <Lann> hmm
[10:24:47] <duch_kazatel> keep in mind that in-store costs can change even within cities for certain market segments.
[10:24:48] <Lann> ah odd, why is it local
[10:25:12] <duch_kazatel> because you'll charge different amounts in different neighborhoods.
[10:25:27] <Lann> the one i'm working on has a server farm for online vendors
[10:25:27] <duch_kazatel> but they offer the ability to do searching via their API.
[10:25:32] <Lann> scrapping shipping, getting real prices
[10:25:59] <Lann> even for vendors who really try to hide the final price
[10:26:08] <Lann> like even amazon haha
[10:26:17] <duch_kazatel> actually those vendors have a good reason for "hiding" that price until you, say, add to card.
[10:26:19] <duch_kazatel> *cart
[10:26:38] <Lann> it seems to be so that you cant compare
[10:26:52] <duch_kazatel> not at all.
[10:27:07] <duch_kazatel> it's because of MAP restrictions half the time - minimum advertised price.
[10:27:25] <duch_kazatel> it's a way companies do price fixing without actually doing price fixin.
[10:27:27] <duch_kazatel> *fixing
[10:27:47] <Lann> oh odd, i dont yet go as far as scraping within carts like that
[10:27:57] <Lann> but i'll read their policy closely and try to emulate it with an algorithm
[10:28:02] <Lann> or scrape if it's available
[10:28:18] <Lann> amazon's algorithm was like 3 pages of code
[10:28:30] <duch_kazatel> not surprising.  they make money off tracking.
[10:28:31] <Lann> they provide product prices via api but shipping is hidden for the most part
[10:28:59] <Lann> i dunno, who knows
[10:28:59] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[10:29:07] <duch_kazatel> I do - I work in that industry :)
[10:29:09] <Lann> this guy will have spent maybe $100k on this site total including the backend
[10:29:13] <Lann> i wonder if he'll succeed
[10:29:22] <duch_kazatel> maybe.  he's one of many now in that space.
[10:29:28] <Lann> yeah
[10:30:06] <Lann> seems like google used to be the king of it and allegedly they started skewing the results
[10:30:16] <duch_kazatel> yup - CSE.  they're still the king.
[10:30:19] <Lann> then everyone found out and a bunch of competitors popped up
[10:31:14] <Lann> that's the good thing about being a freelancer
[10:31:21] <Lann> if it fails…that really sucks for my employer
[10:31:41] <Lann> sucks for me to have to find a new gig but that only takes …well once it took 2 days but sometimes a few weeks
[10:32:12] <duch_kazatel> i worked for a company that's doing something similar but for local shopping.  it's a very strange industry. the ecommerce world is similarly cutthroat.
[10:32:25] <Lann> so it would seem
[10:32:29] <Lann> everyone's doing something shady i'm finding
[10:32:35] <duch_kazatel> eh kind of.
[10:32:37] <Lann> like newegg using A/B testing on their prices
[10:32:47] <Lann> little things i find as i scrape
[10:40:48] <fossxplorer> Hi, i'm trying to use google translate on my site, buy i have some hard time finding out how i can adjust my site when it applies top:40px when a user chooses a language.
[10:41:40] <fossxplorer> i get a 40 px white space under the header when the translation is applied. I can see that it's applied for the body element.
[11:18:48] <tieTYT2> hi
[11:19:16] <tieTYT2> I want to capture a radio button change event.  Do they react to "click" events?
[11:22:05] <duch_kazatel> tieTYT2 there's a "change" even for forms.
[11:22:19] <duch_kazatel> *event
[11:23:01] <BillCriswell>  duch_kazatel It should bubble up.
[11:23:33] <BillCriswell> So if you do $('form').on('change', something); and an input inside it changes the form will fire the change event.
[11:24:02] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[11:24:07] <duch_kazatel> there are a few ways to skin that cat.
[11:24:23] <duch_kazatel> i want pointing out that they likely want the "change" event instead of "click"
[11:24:31] <BillCriswell> I thought you were asking. My bad.
[11:24:36] <BillCriswell> I just misread completely.
[11:24:44] <duch_kazatel> oh, hah.  good times!
[11:24:50] <duch_kazatel> welcome to friday!
[11:25:08] <BillCriswell> Yeah, sucks it feels like a Tuesday.
[11:25:19] <duch_kazatel> ouch
[11:26:50] <duch_kazatel> your weeks must be weird.
[11:27:46] <BillCriswell> Well Christmas Eve and Christmas
[11:27:58] <BillCriswell> Felt like Saturday and Sunday.
[11:29:20] <duch_kazatel> aaaah.  fair enough  i had to work christmas eve.
[11:52:50] <kboers> Anyone have any recommendations for incrementally adding results from a running job to a page?
[11:53:15] <duch_kazatel> like chunking the JS response?
[11:53:26] <kboers> on the server, a worker will be processing tasks and updating them with a complete flag in the database. I'd like to append those to the page as they come in
[11:54:01] <kboers> Right now, I have the page refreshing constantly with the task results (which are images). I imagine it's not great to keep refreshing the page with a ton of images
[11:54:06] <duch_kazatel> you'll need to setup some kind of push setup.
[11:54:31] <kboers> I was hoping to avoid bolting websockets on to this project
[11:54:52] <kboers> can you describe what you mean by push setup?
[11:55:02] <duch_kazatel> well, websockets might be your only choice.
[11:55:26] <duch_kazatel> i gotta head out on lunch, but go check out push vs. pull.
[11:55:41] <kboers> I was thinking I could keep track of which task results have already been sent/received and then only appending the ones that haven't been rendered yet
[11:55:46] <kboers> too kludgy?
[11:56:21] <duch_lunch> kboers how are you doing that check though?  ajax?
[11:56:28] <duch_lunch> you have to have some kind of timer setup.
[11:56:29] <kboers> yeah
[11:56:50] <duch_lunch> that's about as good as it'll get unless you do some kind of websockets/push setup.
[11:56:57] <kboers> I'll look to see if I can implement some lightweight websocket stuff
[11:57:04] <kboers> thanks!
[12:15:40] <kenzooo> site like this will work on ie9
[12:15:44] <kenzooo> http://pasteboard.co
[12:15:53] <kenzooo> for directly pasting images from clipboard to website
[12:17:30] <Playied> hi
[12:20:32] <Playied> Can someone explain why my Ajax request isn't working?
[12:20:33] <Playied> http://mysticpaste.com/view/x4rkWHYtPF?2
[12:20:55] <Playied> What I'm trying to do is get the image from getImage.php from the page to my main page via Ajax.
[12:37:04] <randomdrake> Playied: you're not doing anything with a successful response.
[12:49:08] <BillCriswell> Scrollbars suck.
[12:57:28] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/OVUVoPu/1/edit?html,css,output Anyone have any hints on how to not allow those shadows to cover the scroll bar? I don't want to detect the OS and add bottom: scrollBarHeightpx; to it, but I feel like there should be another way.
[13:05:10] <platzhirsch> That I don't get, when I store $(selector) in a variable and access the variable again only the selector is stored as a string
[13:05:25] <duch_kazatel> platzhirsch huh?
[13:05:37] <platzhirsch> duch_kazatel: huh indeed, testing it in console I get the expected result
[13:05:40] <duch_kazatel> platzhirsch have a jsfiddle?
[13:08:25] <Guwop> hey guys i have this info here in json
[13:08:25] <Guwop> http://www.isu.hadiismail.com/includes/parsing.php
[13:08:36] <Guwop> im trying to use ajax and im only gettin the first
[13:08:36] <Guwop> http://www.isu.hadiismail.com/index.php
[13:09:15] <platzhirsch> duch_kazatel: nevermind, I was looked for another error on the wrong line :)
[13:09:54] <duch_kazatel> Guwop did you look at the console error?
[13:10:21] <Guwop> duch_kazatel console error? hwo do you check that
[13:10:36] <duch_kazatel> Guwop what browser are you using?
[13:10:40] <Guwop> chrome
[13:10:45] <duch_kazatel> hit f12
[13:10:56] <duch_kazatel> click on the "console" tab.
[13:11:04] <Guwop> Refused to execute script from 'https://raw.github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/raphael/master/raphael-min.js' because its MIME type ('text/plain') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled. index.php:1
[13:11:04] <Guwop> Uncaught ReferenceError: atheltes is not defined
[13:11:15] <duch_kazatel> see the problem now?
[13:12:33] <Guwop> duch_kazatel not really? uncaught referenceerror: atheltes is not defined
[13:12:42] <Guwop> the problem is that it is defined?
[13:12:59] <duch_kazatel> atheltes isn't defined - are you sure you're spelling that var name correctly?
[13:14:59] <Velveeta> i think it's missing a silent Q
[13:15:03] <Velveeta> athelqtes
[13:15:06] <Guwop> LOL omg duch_kazatel
[13:15:07] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[13:15:10] <Guwop> im gonna kill myself
[13:15:11] <duch_kazatel> :)
[13:15:12] <Guwop> c you guys later
[13:15:15] <Guwop> suiciding
[13:15:16] <duch_kazatel> welcome to programming.
[13:15:18] <Velveeta> lol
[13:15:34] <Guwop> i swear i thought i didnt change anythign
[13:16:00] <Velveeta> you know, one of these days, someone actually is gonna make a programming language that runs itself through a lexical fuzzy matching algorithm so that typos don't matter so long as they're close enough
[13:16:12] <Velveeta> and on that day…… the world is going to explode
[13:16:28] <duch_kazatel> and people will hate that language for some of the reasons they hate JS and ColdFusion.
[13:16:29] <Velveeta> just like case sensitivity being language-specific
[13:16:32] <duch_kazatel> "HAI I HELP U LOLOL"
[13:17:33] <Velveeta> they'll be like "can you tell me why this doesn't work? var abc = true; if (abv === true) { doSomething(); } else if (abbx === undefined) { doSomethingElse(); }
[13:17:58] <Velveeta> and you'll have to tell them that abbx isn't close enough to match against abc, and they'll be like well that's dumb, this language sucks
[13:17:58] <duch_kazatel> nnnnnoooooooooooooo
[13:18:18] <Velveeta> god imagine what a nightmare debugging would be :D
[13:18:34] <Velveeta> use strict! use strict!
[13:18:46] <duch_kazatel> you're describing a nightmar.e
[13:20:10] <Velveeta> you know what really drives me nuts? when someone typos a variable, and you search for the legit spelling and can't find it, because everywhere they used it, they typo'd it consistently
[13:20:27] <duch_kazatel> dude! i've seen that so many times.
[13:20:39] <Velveeta> then you have to worry about "do i change $campaing to $campaign everywhere to satisfy my OCD, and run the risk of missing one?"
[13:20:48] <Velveeta> or do i leave it working, and just swallow it
[13:21:03] <duch_kazatel> even better - "do I fix it and run the risk of it breaking something else..."
[13:21:08] <Velveeta> exactly
[13:21:15] <Velveeta> you never know where that kind of crap can spiderweb to
[13:21:19] <duch_kazatel> bingo.
[13:21:21] <Velveeta> and that's what unit tests are for!
[13:21:31] <Velveeta> if only 90% of people wrote them :D
[13:21:32] <duch_kazatel> pfffft.
[13:21:47] <duch_kazatel> i wish i had time these days tbh.  we're moving in that direction luckily.
[13:21:56] <Velveeta> we are also
[13:22:37] <Velveeta> i made a decree on my own team that we wouldn't go back and flesh out unit tests for existing work, but all new work had to have test coverage, and any defects that came in need unit tests to verify the fix, because they were previously missed by existing test coverage
[13:22:49] <Velveeta> seems a lot more manageable that way
[13:22:59] <duch_kazatel> yup. that's a smart way to do it.
[13:23:10] <Velveeta> i wrote a blog post about front end tests a while back
[13:23:27] <Velveeta> it started with "What do we want?! Front end unit tests?! When do we want it! For several years, now!"
[13:23:36] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha fantastic point.
[13:23:48] <duch_kazatel> our QA team is writing automation tests, too, finally.
[13:23:57] <duch_kazatel> gets them out of doing menial, small testing.
[13:24:14] <Velveeta> yeah, we have a person in QA that's responsible for writing selenium coverage, and the rest of our QA people just handle regression testing mostly
[13:24:23] <duch_kazatel> same here.
[13:24:29] <Velveeta> we've finally gotten a testswarm server up and running
[13:24:30] <duch_kazatel> well, 2 people or so.
[13:24:41] <Velveeta> so we're hoping to use that to encourage all of our product teams to start writing unit tests
[13:24:47] <tieTYT2> I'd like to make it possible to move from input to input by using the arrow keys.  Am I going to have to use javascript to code what each key does on each input,  or is there an easier way to accomplish this?
[13:24:58] <Velveeta> and integrate that as part of their jenkins build or deploy process
[13:25:06] <duch_kazatel> tieTYT2 you have to use javascript.
[13:25:24] <Velveeta> i think he's asking if there's an easier way them specifying per input what the next/previous input is
[13:25:39] <tieTYT2> i'm asking that next, if I have to use javascript
[13:25:41] <Velveeta> you could do it with something like a tabindex attribute or something similar
[13:25:48] <Velveeta> yes, you do have to use javascript
[13:26:04] <duch_kazatel> well, i mean, that's kind of the point - you could use tabindex and then increment that value and then set the focus to be on the right input.
[13:26:12] <Velveeta> you could use some kind of like, data-index attribute or something, to track the order of the inputs
[13:26:16] <Velveeta> right
[13:26:25] <tieTYT2> hm, not sure how I could use a tab index if up and down are involved.  If I add a new button in the middle, wont that mess everything up?
[13:26:47] <Velveeta> and for each input, generically, just say if it's a left arrow, find the input w/ the previous tabindex and setfocus to it, otherwise, for right arrows, find the input with the next higher tabindex and setfocus to that
[13:27:07] <tieTYT2> that works for only left/right.  What about up and down?
[13:27:12] <Velveeta> if you add a new input element dynamically, you'd be responsible for maintaining those tabindexes
[13:27:22] <Velveeta> well, the keys themselves are really arbitrary
[13:27:29] <duch_kazatel> tieTYT2 determine how many are in each column and math it :)
[13:27:33] <Velveeta> you'd define the rules for what means prev/next, whether that's left/right or up/down
[13:28:03] <Velveeta> but you'd want some kind of indexing values in place in the elements themselves, to be able to determine generically what next/prev means
[13:28:08] <Velveeta> 1 number down or 1 number up
[13:28:43] <Velveeta> are you talking about having up/down *and* left/right being separate dimensions?
[13:28:43] <tieTYT2> is it possible to be able to focus on an a tag, too?
[13:28:52] <duch_kazatel> yeah that's he's asking for.
[13:28:57] <Velveeta> not a non-form tag
[13:29:07] <Velveeta> er non-form-element
[13:29:17] <Velveeta> regular html tags don't support focus as far as i know
[13:29:33] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta they have a tabindex though, iirc.
[13:29:57] <duch_kazatel> if you want to use the up/down arrows, take your number of columns (like 3) and add that number to the current index.
[13:29:58] <Velveeta> so theoretically, people could go up, and then right, and then up, left, down, right, etc?
[13:30:51] <tieTYT2> yeah but not everything is a grid.  Most things aren't.
[13:31:11] <Velveeta> well then you'd probably want to index them in 2 dimensions
[13:31:12] <tieTYT2> for example, on one page the inputs dynamically increase based on state
[13:31:17] <Velveeta> like a data-x and data-y kind of attribute
[13:31:19] <tieTYT2> ah.... that's a good idea
[13:31:28] <Velveeta> and let up/down increment and decrement the x value, and left/right handle the y's
[13:31:42] <Velveeta> er, that was flip-flopped
[13:31:55] <tieTYT2> i get ya.  So should I store these values in the html?
[13:32:01] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[13:32:08] <Velveeta> yepyep
[13:32:12] <duch_kazatel> generate them as apart of the markup.
[13:32:16] <tieTYT2> how do I do that?  Won't that be invalid html?
[13:32:25] <Velveeta> data-* attributes are valid in html5
[13:32:27] <duch_kazatel> data attributes are valid.
[13:32:32] <Velveeta> they're meant specifically for this kind of usage
[13:32:37] <tieTYT2> oh great.  I'll look into that.  Thanks a lot for the help
[13:32:40] <Velveeta> no problem
[13:33:28] <Velveeta> so 1.11 and 2.1 b3 were released a week ago
[13:33:38] <Velveeta> i wanna know when the official releases are
[13:33:50] <snover> sometime between now and later
[13:33:53] <Velveeta> because i'm ready to jump all over that AMD'ification, but not until it's official
[13:34:58] <Velveeta> i'm kind of surprised jquery ui hasn't jumped on board the amd train yet also
[13:36:14] <snover> if you want amd-based ui, try dojo
[13:37:12] <Velveeta> it's been a long time since i touched dojo, but we have an internal widget library built on top of the jquery ui widget factory also, so i'd like to keep it in the family
[13:37:41] <Velveeta> i may grab the latest version of ui whenever jquery 1.11 launches, and manually split it up into modules to publish with our core product
[13:38:15] <Velveeta> we don't do UI upgrades often, so it would be something i'd only have to do once every several months, hopefully by the next time we do it, they'll have their own build tooling to automate that
[13:38:16] <clime> hey, is there a way to convert string containing set of html divs into jquery object? $.parseHTML returns array. $() return jquery object but it is sensitive to things like whitespaces, etc.
[13:38:45] <Velveeta> clime: sensitive to things like whitespace?
[13:38:58] <clime> Velveeta: yes
[13:39:03] <Velveeta> how do you mean?
[13:39:44] <clime> Velveeta: e.g. $(' <div></div>) fails
[13:39:54] <clime> Velveeta: $(' <div></div>')
[13:40:14] <Velveeta> in what version of jquery?
[13:40:46] <clime> velvetta: 1.9.1
[13:41:13] <Velveeta> clime: if i go to the jquery.com site and open a js console and copy/paste that line into it, it evaluates just fine
[13:41:34] <Velveeta> > $(' <div></div>')
[13:41:35] <Velveeta> [<div>​</div>​]
[13:41:59] <clime> hmmp, for me it is: Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: <div></div>
[13:42:26] <duch_kazatel> clime you're doing literally $(' <div></div>'), right?
[13:42:39] <Velveeta> hmm, i typically see unrecognize expression errors for colon pseudo selectors that aren't defined, like $(':sdkfj')
[13:42:47] <clime> yes, literally
[13:42:51] <Velveeta> i don't think i've ever seen them just for markup
[13:43:03] <Velveeta> is this on a live url somewhere that we can see it?
[13:43:36] <randomdrake> clime: what's wrong with parseHTML returning an array?
[13:44:08] <clime> velvetta: http://jsfiddle.net/v7F4L/
[13:44:20] <clime> velveeta:
[13:44:26] <Velveeta> yeah i see it, weird
[13:44:36] <duch_kazatel> woah weird
[13:45:05] <Velveeta> looks like that's a regression in 1.9.1
[13:45:13] <Velveeta> on the edge version, it works, and on 1.8.3 it works
[13:45:35] <duch_kazatel> and it's only when it's it front.  $('<div></div> ') works fine.
[13:45:46] <duch_kazatel> i wonder if that's an issue with the fragment it makes.
[13:45:51] <Velveeta> can you just trim the whitespace before feeding it in?
[13:46:05] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/v7F4L/5/
[13:46:43] <Velveeta> and also, randomdrake asked a good question, you could take the generated html array and just feed it to a jquery constructor
[13:46:50] <systemfault> $.parseHTML exists for that purpose in 1.9.x
[13:46:56] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/v7F4L/6/
[13:47:34] <clime> velveeta, randomdrake: alright, that seems to be the best way for me. Thank you!
[13:48:14] <systemfault> $(HTML_HERE) is a lot stricter starting with 1.9.x
[13:48:34] <systemfault> If you want to feed it ugly HTML, then $.parseHTML is there for that.
[13:48:58] <Velveeta> i wonder why in the edge version it works just fine through the constructor
[13:49:05] <Velveeta> maybe it uses parseHTML internally
[13:50:19] <systemfault> Perhaps they reverted to the old behavior because people were complaining... I don't know
[13:50:37] <Velveeta> looks like it, from jquery.init in 1.10: jQuery.merge( this, jQuery.parseHTML(
[13:50:49] <fossxplorer> Can anyone give me a hand on how i can adjust the Google API inserting a top:40px into the body element?
[13:52:05] <shwackd> Hey guys, I've used jsonp in the past and I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong here. It should be working. Can anybody tell me what I'm doing wrong?  Here is my .js file http://pastebin.com/BJA9HQMT
[13:52:29] <shwackd> the alert call in updateprices is never called and I dont know why
[13:53:38] <Velveeta> have you tried converting that jsonp call to a jquery $.ajax call and seeing if it starts behaving?
[13:53:51] <Velveeta> i would assume it functions through an onload handler triggering your callback
[13:53:54] <shwackd> no I figured there might be somethig liek that avaliable so I came here for help
[13:53:56] <Velveeta> and i don't see an onload here
[13:53:59] <systemfault> shwackd: IIRC, script loading after the DOM is ready is async, you probably need to handle onload
[13:54:05] <shwackd> it's in the index.html file
[13:54:27] <shwackd> I have window.onload with a setInterval that calls addscript -  the set interval is being called succesfuly and it's working - addscript function runs every 10 seconds.
[13:54:34] <shwackd> it's the callback  that's not working
[13:54:56] <Velveeta> you would typically set an onload listener on the script tag itself
[13:55:06] <shwackd> I get this error SyntaxError: missing ; before statement 	  "btc_e_btc_set": true,   even though the json at http://wdcticker.com/api/ticker  passes json lint perfectly
[13:55:36] <Velveeta> if you decide to convert that to using $.ajax, you should only need to set the dataType property to 'jsonp', as far as i know
[13:55:39] <DjMadness> Hi guys, i am trying to move an element to "higher grounds" to move it out of the div where content is into a wrapper for the whole page, i use "$("#holder").append($('#listbnc_manage').detach());" to do this and it works fine, but i also want to hide it again, i've used the following before without issues "$('#listbnc_manage').fadeOut(0);" but now when combining them both its not working properly every time (sometimes it works,
[13:55:39] <DjMadness> othertimes it does not), is there a better way for me to perform this task ?
[13:55:50] <zeroquake> Hello , i have this piece of js code which adds  "P" tag in the body in a iframe -- works great in chrome - but fails in IE AND Firefox -- any idea wy ?? http://jsfiddle.net/Qpm2N/
[13:58:26] <Velveeta> zeroquake: you may need to grab a handle to the proper document element in the iframe, which is browser-specific, like this: docroot = iframe.contentDocument || iframe.contentWindow.document
[13:59:21] <Velveeta> djmadness: you may want to delay the fadeout by 1ms w/ a setTimeout
[13:59:38] <zeroquake> i do not follow ?
[13:59:46] <systemfault> Doesn't jQuery have .contents() for that?
[13:59:52] <DjMadness> Velveeta: ah maybe a good idea...
[13:59:57] <Velveeta> some browsers are slower when it comes to dom manipulation, and if it's not attached at the time you try to fade it out, i'm gonna guess it won't work
[14:00:13] <systemfault> http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[14:00:16] <Velveeta> systemfault zeroquake: i've never used contents() for an iframe like that, so i can't say if that works or not
[14:00:39] <Velveeta> yeah i guess so, judging by that api documentation
[14:00:45] <DjMadness> nopes, unortunaly it did not help... ill try settimeout instead then
[14:00:46] <Velveeta> is the iframe in the same domain?
[14:01:33] <Velveeta> djmadness: yeah try something like this: $('#holder').append($('#listbnc_manage')); setTimeout(function () { $('#listbnc_manage').fadeOut(); }, 1);
[14:01:40] <zeroquake> I am not sure what exactly do you mean by same domain ? -
[14:01:57] <Velveeta> btw, you don't need to run detach on that listbnc_manage element to append it to another one, it'll automatically detach and reattach itself
[14:02:00] <zeroquake> what would you recommend using other than .contents?
[14:02:32] <Velveeta> zeroquake: same domain means if your page is loading from www.domainname.com, your iframe is also loading from there, vs something like abc.domainname.com, or www.google.com or something
[14:02:50] <zeroquake> same domain
[14:02:50] <Velveeta> i can't remember if child domains violate same domain policy or not
[14:05:20] <DjMadness> Velveeta: moving it is so that i can center the element in the absolute center of the window instead of in the center of the div its loaded in
[14:05:38] <DjMadness> but the above did not help unfortunly
[14:05:54] <Velveeta> djmadness: that's fine, what i'm saying is that you don't have to explicitly call .detach(), the .append() method you're feeding it to will detach it for you
[14:06:23] <Velveeta> $(selectorA).append($(selectorB).detach()) is functionally equivalent to $(selectorA).append($(selectorB))
[14:07:05] <Velveeta> djmadness: can you put together a jsfiddle example
[14:07:28] <DjMadness> sure, will take a moment though, its a huge project
[14:10:32] <Playied> If I use $.get to  get a .php page. How can I use $.post to edit the values of the PHP page?
[14:11:06] <Playied> For example, I have a function in php called returnValue($int); and I want to pass the value of that from JavaScript to PHP
[14:11:38] <Velveeta> so, wait.. the function lives in php, but you want to pass it from js to php?
[14:11:57] <Playied> Yes
[14:11:59] <DjMadness> Velveeta: a small example of it, ofc the content in #page_content is dynamycly fetched via an .ajax call http://jsfiddle.net/BD8yY/
[14:12:18] <Velveeta> playied: you can pass the *return* of that function into another php file, but you can't pass that function itself via js
[14:12:49] <Playied> velveeta, what it does is the returnValue() executes inside the PHP. the $.get, retrieves the output from the method and puts it on the index.php. I want to put it so that if I click a button, it will change the value of returnValue() therefore changing the output on index.php from the retrieved page.
[14:13:15] <Playied> So I need to make another .php file?
[14:13:17] <Velveeta> playied: i'm still not following here
[14:13:42] <Playied> I have a link that loads from getLink.php. I get it from $.get
[14:13:58] <Playied> Inside getLink.php I created a function that passes an int into an SQL statment
[14:14:06] <Velveeta> ok
[14:14:20] <Playied> I want it so that if I hit previous it will load a new int in to the function, and it will go to the image id below that.
[14:14:53] <Velveeta> so the int that it uses in that function, where does it get that int from?
[14:14:57] <Velveeta> the $.get call?
[14:15:54] <Playied> I call the function in the getLink.php
[14:16:20] <Velveeta> but the int that you call that function with, where does it come from?
[14:16:39] <Playied> rand(1, $lastIdInDB);
[14:16:50] <Velveeta> so it's entirely server side
[14:16:57] <Playied> the PHP part is
[14:16:58] <Playied> XD
[14:17:03] <Playied> I can't use node.js either
[14:17:06] <Velveeta> right, there's no such thing as client side php as far as i know
[14:17:13] <Playied> ^ my point
[14:17:28] <systemfault> Good thing...
[14:17:30] <Playied> Want me to just post the code?
[14:17:33] <Playied> Mystic paste ftw?
[14:17:36] <Velveeta> if you want to be able to modify something with that function from the client, then you need to make that function's parameters dependent on a client-side variable, like $_GET['id_to_use']
[14:17:49] <pacmanfan> i'm having a weird problem with jqueryui tooltip
[14:18:24] <pacmanfan> the tooltip shifts farther away from the target when i rapidly mouseover the target
[14:18:25] <pacmanfan> http://engraveacrete.com/shop/stain-test.html
[14:18:59] <pacmanfan> i'm using demo code from the site, so it may be conflicting with my existing CSS, but i can't figure out how to troubleshoot it
[14:19:14] <pacmanfan> *using demo code from the jqueryui site
[14:19:20] <Playied> velveeta, http://mysticpaste.com/view/UChV3dvTvJ?2
[14:20:03] <Velveeta> djmadness: adding a 1ms timeout works for me on this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/BD8yY/5/
[14:21:25] <Velveeta> playied: you're not passing any kind of parameter to that request that might be used to change which image you're using
[14:21:41] <Velveeta> you have to pass something, and you have to modify your php code to use that parameter that was passed
[14:21:55] <Velveeta> you can't alter the php script from javascript, all you can do is pass parameters to it
[14:23:08] <Playied> velveeta, what do you mean I'm not passing anything?
[14:23:23] <shwackd> Ok i finally found out the answer, wdcticker.com does not support jsonp - - I was wrong to think that any json could be used with jsonp
[14:23:27] <Playied> function returnValue($int) {
[14:23:35] <shwackd> thank you for helping everyone
[14:23:38] <Velveeta> i mean you're calling for a get or post to that script, but you're not passing any parameters to it
[14:23:40] <Playied> "SELECT link FROM funnyimage WHERE id='$int'"
[14:23:54] <Velveeta> that's *server-side*
[14:23:58] <Playied> That $.get is retrieving information from the server
[14:24:01] <Playied> from the PHP
[14:24:12] <Velveeta> you have to pass a parameter *to* the server from javascript if you want to change the way it's behaving
[14:24:17] <Playied> I was wanting to know if there is a way to use a $.get to send info to the PHP/ Server
[14:24:23] <Playied> Exactly
[14:24:25] <Playied> idk  how to do that XD
[14:24:25] <Velveeta> yes, i'm telling you how
[14:24:30] <Playied> oh haha how do I do it
[14:24:43] <Velveeta> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/
[14:24:55] <Velveeta> that will tell you exactly how to pass data in your request
[14:25:25] <Velveeta> look at the examples section about 2/3 of the way down
[14:27:08] <Playied> $.get( "test.php", { name: "John", time: "2pm" } );
[14:28:26] <Velveeta> rightio
[14:28:42] <Playied> how do I pass info to a function though
[14:28:45] <Playied> OHH nvm I gotcha
[14:28:47] <Playied> I got it
[14:28:48] <Velveeta> so you could pass a parameter with an explicit id to be loaded, or something like "previous" or whatever you want to use
[14:29:03] <Velveeta> and then on the receiving end, you just reference something like $_GET['previous']
[14:29:51] <Playied> Oh, can I override previous ones?
[14:30:00] <Playied> like $randomNumber
[14:30:16] <Playied> $.get( "test.php", { randomNumber: 1} );
[14:30:35] <Playied> then it replace randomNumber therefore giving me what I need?
[14:30:55] <Velveeta> sure, you can say like: if (isset($_GET['randomNumber'])) { $randomNumber = $_GET['randomNumber']; } else { $randomNumber = Math.random(); }
[14:33:23] <DjMadness> Velveeta: not working well here, but i switched to position: fixed in the css and used z-index to acheive approx the same result
[14:33:49] <Velveeta> djmadness: what browser are you testing it in, just out of curiosity?
[14:33:55] <DjMadness> chrome
[14:34:00] <Playied> You're genius
[14:34:02] <Playied> let me try it
[14:34:04] <Velveeta> weird, that one should be plenty fast
[14:34:16] <DjMadness> i think thats the problem, too fast
[14:34:27] <Velveeta> but that's a good thing
[14:34:27] <DjMadness> maybe some multithreading going on or something
[14:34:46] <Velveeta> javascript is single threaded
[14:35:23] <DjMadness> ah okays, nice to know, at least i got it solved :)
[14:36:03] <DjMadness> thanks for your time :D
[14:36:12] <Playied> Velveeta, it didn't work
[14:36:28] <Velveeta> playied: well you have to play with it, you can't try once and give up
[14:36:35] <Playied> Oh trust me I haven't been
[14:36:42] <Playied> XD I have recoded this part of the PHP over 3 times so far
[14:36:49] <Playied> Like erased it all went with a different method
[14:38:40] <Playied> Also, I want it to only change the value of $randomNumber if I hit previous
[14:40:39] <Velveeta> well then you would only send that data in your previous js
[14:40:52] <Velveeta> otherwise, it should default to a Math.random() call on the server
[14:40:56] <Velveeta> that's what that isset check was for
[14:41:03] <Playied> isset checks to see if it's null
[14:41:08] <Playied> It shouldn't be null ever though
[14:41:27] <Velveeta> $_GET['randomNumber'] would be null if you didn't send it from the client
[14:41:44] <Velveeta> so anytime you send it, isset() resolves to true, if you don't send it, it resolves to false
[14:41:58] <Velveeta> so if it's set, use it, and otherwise, use a generic random number
[14:43:08] <Playied> I can't use a generic random number xD
[14:43:16] <Playied> I have to use a random number between 1 - max id
[14:43:23] <Playied> although I see how isset should work
[14:43:24] <Velveeta> well that's what i mean
[14:43:35] <Velveeta> if you send a number, use it, if not, use whatever logic you were previoiusly using
[14:44:32] <Playied> yeah
[14:44:36] <Playied> but when I go to send a number
[14:44:38] <Playied> it doesn't do it
[14:44:39] <Playied> XD
[14:44:50] <Playied> Should I put it in a loop to constantly check for button pressing xD
[14:46:09] <Velveeta> no, you just bind up a click event listener to your button
[14:46:48] <Playied> by event click listener you mean
[14:46:57] <Playied> $('button.previous').click(function() {
[14:47:01] <Playied> ?
[14:47:46] <DjMadness> yes thats a click event, but i'd use $('button.previous').on('click', function() {
[14:48:01] <Velveeta> i would also
[14:48:09] <Playied> why?
[14:48:12] <DjMadness> its the new way
[14:48:12] <Playied> What is the difference?
[14:48:14] <Velveeta> functionally, they're the same, but it's good to be used to the .on() syntax, it's pretty powerful
[14:48:21] <Playied> Oh I see
[14:48:22] <DjMadness> on works with generated elements
[14:48:39] <DjMadness> a major improvement
[14:48:53] <Playied> generated elements?
[14:49:18] <Velveeta> yep, if you create element elements on the fly and inject them into the dom
[14:49:19] <DjMadness> something you create with javascript
[14:49:29] <Velveeta> you can attach listeners to be run against any new elements of the same time, in advance
[14:49:58] <Velveeta> same type*
[14:52:21] <Velveeta> ok, time for me to disappear for a little while
[14:52:36] <Playied> lol damn
[14:56:39] <duch_kazatel> .on() is baller
[14:57:00] <duch_kazatel> if you want to jquery it up, learn .on() - just about every other event binding setup uses .on()
[14:57:28] <DjMadness> got no objections here, i've started moving all my code to use .on instead of .click
[14:57:49] <duch_kazatel> the event delegation model is reall neat, too.
[15:11:02] <tieTYT2> this doesn't seem to be setting a data attribute on my tab when I look at it in the inspector.  Am i using this wrong?     tab.data("x", i)    tab.data("y", 0)
[15:13:36] <tieTYT2> oh nm i see the problem i think
[15:16:28] <tieTYT2> actually I'd like to retract that "nm"
[15:17:53] <FlashSlayer> $('.className[0]') - I want to get first element that has .className class but it returns nothing
[15:18:55] <duch_kazatel> $('.className')[0]
[15:20:47] <duch_kazatel> FlashSlayer that work for you?
[15:21:01] <FlashSlayer> yes, window.$('.grey:first tr').each() working
[15:21:53] <tieTYT2> so tab.data("x", i) doesn't modify the dom, but tab.attr("data-x", i) does.  Why is that?
[15:22:11] <duch_kazatel> tieTYT2 because one stores data attached to a node, the other edits the DOM.
[15:22:20] <duch_kazatel> *edits an attribute in the html, rather.
[15:23:01] <duch_kazatel> and FlashSlayer I'd go with something like $('.grey').first().find('
[15:23:10] <duch_kazatel> err $('.grey').first().find('tr');
[15:23:18] <duch_kazatel> that might perform a bit better
[15:24:18] <FlashSlayer> will it be faster?
[15:24:41] <tieTYT2> ok thanks
[15:25:22] <duch_kazatel> possibly?  i'd actually have to test it.
[15:29:32] <FlashSlayer> inside .each() - $(this).$('.note:first').text(); - undefined variable $
[15:31:04] <duch_kazatel> fiddle it?
[15:31:20] <duch_kazatel> wait  $(this).$('.note:first').text(); that isn't valid - what is the second part supposed to do?
[15:31:44] <FlashSlayer> http://pastebin.com/LVz56Qe6
[15:32:02] <duch_kazatel> yeah $(tr).$('.note:first') isn't valid.  what are you trying to do?
[15:32:17] <duch_kazatel> find children of $(tr) that mach that selector?
[15:32:18] <FlashSlayer> I'm going to get first .note inside a row
[15:32:56] <duch_kazatel> var code = $(tr).find('.note:first').text();
[15:45:53] <duch_kazatel> FlashSlayer did that help?
[15:47:11] <FlashSlayer> yes
[16:09:18] <codekK> Hello all, im trying to get a response of json with $.getJSON this response is a object serialized but my get always is empty :S http://pastebin.com/P9xQK38U
[16:40:51] <JackPH> hey, anybody know why this won't work for me?
[16:40:54] <JackPH> <input type="radio" name="type" value="2" onclick="function() { $("#outwardboundschedule").fadeOut(); $("#peschedule").fadeIn(); }"> P.E.
[16:41:02] <JackPH> (the onclick part)
[16:41:17] <JackPH> i know its terrible practice but i need to do it inline
[16:41:23] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle it?
[16:41:35] <JackPH> its only one line but ok :)
[16:41:46] <duch_kazatel> the relevant html, too ;)
[16:42:40] <funhouse>  Hi guys, just wondering how you deal with scenes? Do you construct and deconstruct elements? Like for example, say you are on the main menu, when the proceed to the main functionalty of your app, do you deconsruct the
[16:42:47] <funhouse>                   main menu, and rebuild when they come back, or do you hide it.
[16:43:03] <duch_kazatel> "scenes"?
[16:44:01] <JackPH> http://jsfiddle.net/jNf4c/1/
[16:44:06] <JackPH> there we go
[16:44:19] <JackPH> its a form
[16:44:21] <duch_kazatel> uhhh... that's not what you need to do hah
[16:44:39] <JackPH> to me or to funhouse?
[16:44:41] <duch_kazatel> you need to put all the markup in the html field - including your buttons :)
[16:45:02] <JackPH> those are the buttons :P
[16:45:06] <JackPH> they're radio buttons
[16:45:15] <JackPH> oh wait
[16:45:19] <duch_kazatel> right - you put that code in the javascript field ;)
[16:45:19] <JackPH> i see what you mean :P
[16:45:43] <JackPH> http://jsfiddle.net/jNf4c/2/
[16:47:37] <JackPH> any ideas what the problem is? :)
[16:48:22] <duch_kazatel> yup.  do you have your console open?
[16:48:34] <JackPH> yup
[16:48:41] <duch_kazatel> and what does it tell you?
[16:49:20] <JackPH> hang on console didnt load properly it seems
[16:49:27] <JackPH> let me just restart chrome
[16:49:36] <duch_kazatel> because you have 2 distinct problems.
[16:49:58] <JackPH> syntax error, ill fix that
[16:50:19] <JackPH> wait i dont see a syntax error o.o
[16:50:20] <duch_kazatel> one is about nested quotes, the other with how you're trying to run that function.
[16:50:53] <JackPH> come on then, help me out ;)
[16:51:06] <JackPH> no treasure hunts, it's too late for me
[16:51:15] <duch_kazatel> I am ;) change all the double quotes in between the onclick=""
[16:51:20] <duch_kazatel> change them to singles.
[16:51:23] <JackPH> ahhhhh
[16:51:28] <JackPH> missed that
[16:51:45] <duch_kazatel> the second problem is your function syntaxt - function() {} is not valid.
[16:51:53] <duch_kazatel> you need to use an IIFE instead.
[16:53:27] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/jNf4c/3/ - look at the first input to see an example.
[16:53:46] <JackPH> thanks :)
[16:54:03] <JackPH> just looked up IIFEs and i see my mistake
[16:55:32] <JackPH> have a good one :)
[16:55:39] <duch_kazatel> why do you *have* to do it inline?
[16:57:31] <JackPH> are you sure you want to know?
[16:57:40] <JackPH> :P
[16:57:42] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[16:57:45] <duch_kazatel> ALWAYS AAAAAAAHAHAHAHA
[16:57:58] <JackPH> it's part of the coding conventions for this project
[16:58:31] <duch_kazatel> i have never said this before, but you need to not follow convention, then.
[16:58:31] <JackPH> i used to try educating my clients
[16:58:39] <JackPH> but then i realised
[16:58:44] <JackPH> i get more money and less hassle
[16:58:51] <JackPH> when i just follow their bullshit
[16:59:36] <duch_kazatel> i used to think that, and they they came back wanting more stuff, or complaining because the hacky hackerson stuff wasn't working right.
[17:00:26] <JackPH> in both cases i earn more $$$
[17:00:41] <JackPH> still no complaining on my part :P
[17:01:03] <JackPH> ive just accepted that i am a servant fit only to obey my clients orders
[17:01:16] <duch_kazatel> ouch,.
[17:01:24] <JackPH> nah
[17:01:35] <JackPH> stress free life and money
[17:01:59] <JackPH> and anyway, a lot of clients are ok
[17:02:21] <JackPH> its just the occassional bad egg
[17:48:26] <Biappi> hello
[17:49:36] <duch_kazatel> hello
[18:52:25] <Biappi> uhm... is the widgetfactory the "only good" way of creating stateful plugins?
[18:52:42] <Biappi> i don't need anything else from jquery-ui
[19:22:57] <Connor> Hello.  I have a strange thing going on with jquery ui and a dialog with IE8 - IE11.  IF I open the dialog up inside a iframe window... it doesn't pay attention to the height/width parameters.. I can open it up.. then apply them.. then the dialog resizes.. which is visible.. but that's ugly.  If I do it outside of the iframe, it works fine.  Works fine in FF and Chrome too.
[19:28:53] <Connor> I've tracked it down to <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=EmulateIE7" />
[19:29:29] <Connor> I'm not sure why that breaks the behavior..
[19:30:54] <Velveeta> why do you have it forcing IE7 mode?
[19:31:39] <Connor> Very old app.  I don't remember now.. but this is a HUGE application.
[19:32:28] <Velveeta> well, without pausing it in a debugger and seeing how it calculates its size, i don't know that you'll find an easy answer to that problem… compatibility mode is by no means an exact science
[19:33:45] <Connor> No.  I just don't understand why it would make and difference inside a iframe vs outside..  if both the iframe and the page that calls the dialog have the same doctype and header info..
[19:34:44] <Connor> I may try turning Quirks mode off and see what breaks..
[19:34:48] <Velveeta> not sure off the top of my head
[19:35:57] <Velveeta> is this like freelance work you're doing, or something for your company?
[19:39:08] <Velveeta> because if it's freelance work, there's not much you can do about it, but if it's work for your company, you should probably start having the conversation that IE11 is out, and IE7 is nearly 8 years old and about to be end of lifed, and some of that technical debt needs to start being paid down so you can start taking advantage of more modern IE features
[19:39:33] <Velveeta> management never wants to hear that, but sometimes you have to drive it from the lower levels
[19:39:55] <Connor> It's.... Complicated...
[19:40:42] <Connor> the app is used by a huge amount of government agencies.. as such.. they're stuck with older browsers much of the time.
[19:41:09] <Velveeta> well, with IE11, IE went evergreen, which means they're gonna be doing automatic updates of their software now, the same as chrome and FF already do… i don't know if they're going to the same versioning scheme as chrome and FF, but when IE is on version 27 out there, and you guys are still forcing IE7 mode, that's not gonna be pretty
[19:41:22] <Velveeta> i understand, i work in a company that does healthcare consulting, and a lot of hospital networks are in the same boat
[19:41:51] <Velveeta> we have to support IE7 also, but we make our pages *functional* in 7, and let them degrade where it doesn't make sense to continually throw manhours into a meat grinder
[19:42:30] <Connor> okay.. in non quirks mode..  the frame now has a scrollie visible even though I have overflow:hidden on it.. and it's fracked with the padding
[19:43:10] <Velveeta> is it the frame itself that has the scrollbar, or potentially an element nested within the frame?
[19:44:18] <Connor> well.. the frame shouldn't have one at all.. i.. and I have html {      overflow:hidden; } which kills it in quirks mode.
[19:44:48] <Velveeta> well i mean, could it be some div or any other container within the frame?
[19:44:51] <Connor> the scrollie is just fadded out.. thus eatting up horizontal space..
[19:45:15] <Connor> god I hate IE..
[19:47:39] <Velveeta> just wait until people start pushing you to add mobile support.. it's like stepping back into the dark ages of IE :D
[20:02:25] <Connor> okay.. got that fixed.. the scollie.. had to add overflow: hidden to the body..
[20:02:32] <Connor> now.. why do I have extra padding at the top..
[20:13:39] <Connor> okay.. now a dialog that's called from outside of the frame no longer centered.. in non quirks mode..
[20:16:06] <quarters> hello. I'm having issues with jsfiddle or the tryit app on w3schools running in chrome as I'm getting a "blocked a frame with origin "..." from accessing a frame with origin "..." protocols, domains, and ports must match error. Any help would be appreciated
[20:17:27] <gordian> anyone know of some good tutorials for adding ajax with jQuery to the WooCommerce login, registration, and forgot password forms?
[20:29:57] <beatnyk> i have a question about cloud carousel if anyone is familiar with that (i hope), my question is How do space these images out a bit more because when they come around to the front, the pics behind it try to overlap the front picture... take a look on main page http://pointstackers.com
[20:30:23] <beatnyk> i think if it filled the container it would have enough space in between to not sloppily overlap when it comes around to the front
[20:30:32] <beatnyk> but im not sure how to do this unfortunately :(
[20:35:57] <beatnyk> i tried messing with firebug css live preview for all elements to no avail, also looked through the cloudcarousel.js file
[20:36:08] <beatnyk> stumped i am and noone is here it seems
[20:36:15] <beatnyk> back to the google
[20:36:18] <beatnyk> lol
[20:36:46] <beatnyk> will definitely idle here so if anyone is feelin froggy to solve my problem that'd be aces
[20:54:46] <beatnyk> stumper
