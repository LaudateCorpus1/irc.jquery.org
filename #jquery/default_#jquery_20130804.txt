[01:49:42] <guillermito> hi guys
[01:50:23] <guillermito> I'd like to detach some elements from their parents and afterwards reattach them, obviously a need a 2d tuple containing the parent of each element and the position relative to another node
[01:50:48] <guillermito> how would I grab the second one?
[01:52:20] <guillermito> meh, obviously I need the previous sibling
[01:52:39] <guillermito> too early in the morning being a sunday I guess xD
[02:34:44] <dzined> hi people
[02:35:36] <dzined> have a blonde moment - - http://pastie.org/8205005  , i'm trying to clone an element and insert it before that cloned element, but its not working..any ideas what i'm doing wrong?
[02:36:37] <dzined> "I meant to say AFTER the cloned element"
[02:37:05] <salllo> hi
[02:37:15] <dzined> i'm pretty sure the object is being cloned, but just can't get it to appear with insertAfter
[02:38:23] <salllo> hello

[04:04:11] <mobasher> I Have a problem with jquery live function. I have a table and the user can add rows to the table dynamically i mean when the user clicks add a row is added to the table and there is a textbox to enter a value and save. i user live to bind the clickevent of save to something but it makes the function to be executed more than one time
[04:05:17] <Ansikt> mobasher: there's no way that the selector meets the criteria twice?
[04:05:42] <boytoy_> mobasher: I think live() is deprecated, use on() instead
[04:06:08] <Ansikt> for example, <div class="name"><div class="name">Click Me</div></div> jQuery('.name').live(myCallback)
[04:06:50] <Ansikt> boytoy:  That depends on the jQuery version he's using.  .on was introduced in 1.7
[04:07:15] <boytoy_> yep thats true
[04:07:18] <mobasher> Ansikt: but it is because of live I am sure
[04:07:21] <Ansikt> But yes, at the very least you should be using .delegate, even if .on is not in your jquery version mobasher
[04:07:43] <mobasher> my jquery version is 1.8.3 i think
[04:07:52] <mobasher> but on would'nt work
[04:07:59] <mobasher> i test it again
[04:08:11] <Ansikt> mobasher: on has weird syntax, but it SHOULD work.
[04:08:46] <Ansikt> Though I really think the problem is what you're binding live to, not the method itself.
[04:11:15] <mobasher> Ansikt: $('span#save').live('click', function(){//my function comes here});
[04:11:22] <mobasher> is it not right?
[04:12:31] <Ansikt> that looks correct to me.  There's something really odd going on here, and it's hard for me to make a guess without a code example.
[04:12:33] <Ansikt> try this:
[04:13:20] <Ansikt> make an example of this code in a jsfiddle or something, the most pared down example you can, then expand it to match closer and closer to your own code.  It's a tedious process, but it's served me well in the past.
[04:20:33] <mobasher> Ansikt: could the problem be because of thie: when the user saves somethhing the table content isloaded again with ajax and so the scripts are executed once a again?
[04:22:15] <Ansikt> Not unless you're clicking it again.  There's either some scripting conflict or something else going on here.  Try binding to different elments farther up the DOM and see if the issue still persists.
[04:37:02] <jop008> I have this dom.setAttribute ("src", this.url );  the picture is not inmmediately loading
[04:37:11] <jop008> how can I force this?
[04:38:46] <BenjaminR> jop008: using .prop('src', src) it should load immediately
[04:40:22] <jop008> .prop on the jquery element?
[04:41:27] <BenjaminR> yes
[04:41:50] <BenjaminR> depending on your jquery version it could be .attr too
[04:55:29] <jop008> picture is not loaded
[04:55:35] <jop008> with .prop
[04:56:43] <jop008> setTimeout(setPosition, 1000); helps
[04:58:23] <BenjaminR> i have to leave.
[05:07:24] <jop008> how to load a new url in a <img tag?
[05:07:41] <jop008> It take some time to load it
[05:10:18] <dabear> jop008: https://www.google.com/search?q=jquery+preload+image&oq=jquery+preload+image
[05:14:55] <jop008> whatever I try picture is not loaded after .src handling
[05:32:57] <scrici> hello, i use datatables and to populate table i use json
[05:33:00] <scrici> but i want to add a link for each value
[05:33:06] <scrici> the live page is here
[05:33:10] <scrici> public.playzeek.ro/gather/
[05:33:22] <scrici> i want to add a link for each line from table
[05:33:30] <scrici> it's there an way to do that?
[05:53:50] <jop008> I have this $("#carousel").load(function() { but not triggered if I load a new url for a picture
[05:59:21] <ole`01> jop008, the .load()-function is for loading new content into a layer or box
[05:59:31] <ole`01> it's not for binding events
[06:16:57] <spobat> hi
[06:17:07] <spobat> selector parsing is from right to left, right?
[06:17:23] <spobat> $('#a > div') <- what I mean
[06:17:33] <spobat> but why isn't it from left to right, then?
[06:19:26] <spobat> i think left-> right is faster here
[06:28:10] <sainaen> spobat, afaik, rigt to left, yep. but you can do like this: `$("#a").children("div")` if that selector is slow for you.

[08:09:50] <bradbrad> Hi guys. Really hoping you can help. Im trying to adjust a carousel module here so that when it reaches the last slide, the "next" button gets hidden. Any help/guidance would be greatly appreciated! http://dev.ecofurnituredesign.co.za/products/display
[08:10:39] <bradbrad> that or the slider must go back to the begining... whatever is easiest!
[08:11:24] <tw2113> what slider plugin
[08:11:50] <tw2113> did you check the documentation for anything like that already being available
[08:12:21] <Dinho> http://bxslider.com/
[08:12:24] <Dinho> http://bxslider.com/
[08:12:31] <Dinho> solve your problem http://bxslider.com/
[08:12:58] <hirsty> Ravindol: no need to spam
[08:13:00] <bradbrad> tw2113 its a fastweb carousel module... spoke to them, and unfortunately its not currently implemented, and their developer is away at the moment, so was hoping to try adjust it myself
[08:13:27] <bradbrad> heres the code: http://pastebin.com/8kyrJQc6
[08:14:03] <tw2113> dunno, i've never made sliders myself, i just tweak the settings for already implemented ones
[08:14:08] <bradbrad> and I have to use that specific module because it displays the images from the component
[08:14:21] <Dinho> http://bxslider.com/  solve your slide, full responsive!!
[08:14:39] <bradbrad> tw2113 thats the thing, I dont need to create a new one, I just need to edit the existing slider so that it either loops or stops
[08:14:59] <tw2113> and knowing how to implement this tiny feature would come with knowing how to *make* sliders
[08:15:16] <tw2113> whether you're starting from scratch or adding sauce to someone else's spaghetti
[08:15:32] <tw2113> that little detail doesn't change my knowledge :P
[08:16:41] <bradbrad> was just hoping :)
[08:20:23] <Paulo789> Hey, someone can help me? This script http://pastebin.com/DPADETJ8 works fine with jquery 1.7.2 ... but don't work with 1.10.x ... why ?
[08:23:34] <hirsty> anyone decent with ajax here?
[08:28:22] <Space_> Can you write a function to show what exactly you are clicking on?
[08:47:30] <drbonis> hi, I am a newbie in jquery mobile, just wondering if there is a way to upload a photo from the iphone with a jquery mobile app
[08:48:04] <drbonis> I mean, select a photo from the photoroll of the iphone or make a photo... and then submit it to the server
[08:49:25] <RRR2> drbonis I think you just need plain html don't you?
[08:50:12] <RRR2> Also, is it possible to get some functions of jQuery library instead of all of it?
[08:50:26] <drbonis> RRR2, you mean a plain input type=file will work in iphone?
[08:51:24] <RRR2> drbonis: Yeah, it will, you can scpicify with HTML5 attributes that you only want images
[08:52:46] <RRR2> you can hide the input tag and call it from JS or/and submit the form using JS
[08:53:07] <drbonis> RRR2, anyway the file selection button seems ugly with jquery mobile, other form elements look much better
[08:53:18] <drbonis> that's why I though I was doing something bad
[08:53:27] <aksu> how i can use this: http://joelb.me/blog/2011/code-snippet-accessing-clipboard-images-with-javascript/
[08:53:37] <aksu> im very confused about that
[08:53:44] <RRR2> I think you can style it, if you can't you hide it and use a button that triggers the input file
[08:54:41] <RRR2> You can use clipbaords images with onpaste I think.. if it doesn't work, then it probably uses flash or something.
[08:55:12] <aksu> can you show an example
[08:55:21] <RRR2> Uh sure, why not.
[08:55:47] <aksu> thanks
[08:55:56] <drbonis> RRR2 thanks
[08:59:50] <maasdesigner> i have problem and i didnt find any help at stackoverflow for now i try to my change here, here is my problem. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18043945/in-rails-app-javascript-doesnt-work-in-my-page
[09:01:04] <RRR2> I don't know ruby, lol
[09:03:37] <maasdesigner> RRR2: my question not about ruby, its about jquery problem in my ruby on rails project
[09:05:20] <aksu> heh
[09:05:32] <RRR2> As someone told you, you can paste your generated HTML code soewhere
[09:06:09] <aksu> rr2 is your example ready
[09:06:42] <RRR2> no
[09:07:43] <aksu> oke
[09:10:03] <jop008> I have pictures which are rotated with css that goes fine except for statuing inline with the parent container to show what I mean http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2013-08-04_at_6.06.23_PM-tiP9NWgT.png
[09:11:42] <RRR2> aksu: Wow, jQuery is so easy to use, alright take this. $(window).on('paste',function(a){console.log(a.originalEvent.clipboardData)})
[09:12:08] <RRR2> clipbaordData contains the images and all files it may have on the clipboard
[09:12:29] <aksu> okay
[09:12:59] <RRR2> that includes the images you wanted to get from the clipboard
[09:13:32] <aksu> can i send those images to php script
[09:13:36] <RRR2> Sure
[09:13:43] <RRR2> Wait
[09:13:50] <RRR2> send the images as soon as it's pasted?
[09:14:03] <aksu> when pressing submit button
[09:14:21] <Ungy> is it possible to stop ajaxStart from a load call if so how I cannot find any documentation on how to do it?
[09:15:23] <Ungy> I know if I use global: false on an ajax call it will work but not how to pass that to a load call
[09:23:57] <RRR2> aksu; it seems it uses dataTransferList instead of FileList
[09:24:04] <RRR2> you may have to support both.
[09:25:32] <aksu> okay that's fine
[09:39:46] <RRR2> aksu: chek it out var f;$(window).on('paste',function(a){console.log(Array.prototype.forEach.call(a.originalEvent.clipboardData.items,function(a){console.log(/image/.test(a.type),a.type);if(/image/.test(a.type)){console.log(f=a.getAsFile());i=new Image();i.src=URL.createObjectURL(f);document.open();document.write('<body>');document.body.appendChild(i)}}))
[09:39:48] <RRR2> })
[09:39:58] <RRR2> you'll have to pretify it
[09:40:16] <RRR2> use http://jsbeautifier.org/ or something
[09:42:55] <RRR2> i think you can use $.each instead of Array.prototype.forEach
[09:43:03] <RRR2> I'm just too used to JS
[09:44:26] <aksu> okayy
[09:44:30] <aksu> i try this
[09:45:01] <RRR2> aksu: the script won't just simply submit it to the server obviously, it's just to show you HOW to get the image from the pasteEvent
[09:45:38] <RRR2> now what you need to do is to take the blob file and use Ajax or whatever on a form to get it to send to the server
[09:46:03] <RRR2> I don't know how the php script expects the attributes so I can't help you there..
[09:49:48] <aksu> ehm what's wrong
[09:49:50] <aksu> http://aksunsivut.net/dev/pasteimg.php
[09:50:01] <aksu> nothing appears
[09:51:28] <aksu> when i press ctrl + v
[09:52:52] <spobat> hi
[09:52:54] <RRR2> you must have to be sure it's an image
[09:52:59] <spobat> why do i sometimes get this kind of object?
[09:52:59] <spobat> http://ideone.com/HMIZSA
[09:53:06] <spobat> i don't want the selector definition
[09:53:15] <spobat> I want either the matched object or []
[09:53:22] <RRR2> aksu: are you pasting an image
[09:53:34] <spobat> this one i got by calling .next() on a valid jquery object
[09:54:20] <aksu> 1: i press prt sc 2: i press ctrl v in my page
[09:57:33] <RRR2> spobat: what are you trying to fo
[10:07:10] <spobat> RRR2: i try to get the following object with next()
[10:07:21] <spobat> but no dom object is returned
[10:07:37] <spobat> instead, this stuff from the above link is returned
[10:07:43] <spobat> http://ideone.com/HMIZSA
[10:07:48] <spobat> which is to no use for me, right?
[10:08:16] <RRR2> That seems the object is not a dom object but a jquery object, probably containing a dom object
[10:09:35] <spobat> so what should i do with that?
[10:09:54] <spobat> var room = $(obj).parent(); var a = room.next();
[10:09:58] <spobat> a contains the above
[10:23:45] <RRR2> spobat:well, what do you want to do with the dom element, 'jQuery' it again? No, it's already "jQueried"
[10:26:13] <spobat> ?
[10:26:20] <spobat> I want the object :)
[10:28:42] <RRR2> >inb4 you will jQuery the object again
[10:28:44] <shoky> spobat: jquery objects are array-like, they're a collection of DOM elements. a[0] would get you the element
[10:30:23] <RRR2> No one actually reads $.fn.init
[10:40:06] <Koopz> can someone help me out? http://jsfiddle.net/Cc8UW/ i think i don't get the filter-function..
[10:41:03] <Koopz> could it be that it only works if i match on attributes of the actual element i'm filtering?
[10:45:52] <howieFelterbush> Koopz, you should lookup the api for it filter. I think it filters results, so you return the element or null
[10:46:39] <howieFelterbush> $(".element").filter(function () {if ($(this).is(".ready")) return $(this);return null});
[10:46:53] <howieFelterbush> a long way to grab just the "ready" elements
[10:47:43] <Koopz> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[10:48:00] <howieFelterbush> you may be looking for map. Map I think can return an array
[10:48:02] <Koopz> i don't see any return $(this)
[10:48:31] <howieFelterbush> but you do see in the description, it's designed to select a subset of elements. Elements is the key. Not element properties
[10:49:33] <sainaen> Koopz, firstly, regex should be created like this: new RegExp(name, "i"), without any "/"
[10:49:49] <Koopz> whoops...
[10:50:51] <howieFelterbush> Koopz http://api.jquery.com/map/
[10:51:35] <sainaen> Koopz, secondly, now it hides matched element, so you should invert result of the match() to hide not matched elements instead.
[10:52:46] <Koopz> okay... inverted regex... what was it again...
[10:53:16] <Koopz> ^?
[10:53:24] <sainaen> Koopz, mm. inverted regex?
[10:53:51] <Koopz> ah... its !
[10:54:35] <Koopz> or... not
[10:56:34] <sainaen> Koopz, what are you trying to do? I meant `return !name.match(regex);` inside filter function
[10:57:16] <Koopz> i need to search for the text inside the div
[10:57:43] <Koopz> case insensitive
[10:58:05] <howieFelterbush> are you wanting the text returned or the elements with the text in them?
[10:58:24] <Koopz> i want the parent divs
[10:58:39] <Koopz> so i can hide the ones that have not been matched
[11:00:16] <howieFelterbush> var hideparents=$("div").map(function () { if ($(this).text().indexOf(word)>-1) return $(this).parents().first(); return null;});
[11:00:59] <howieFelterbush> sorry, it's if (!$(this).text().... etc. for the ones to hide
[11:01:27] <howieFelterbush> and I just used div for example. you probably have a better selector to parse.
[11:01:29] <RRR2> you can use RegExp.test
[11:04:59] <sainaen> Koopz, http://jsfiddle.net/Cc8UW/3/
[11:06:08] <Koopz> oh well thanks sainaen!
[11:06:12] <Koopz> works like a charm
[11:09:55] <howieFelterbush> http://jsfiddle.net/Cc8UW/5/
[11:10:55] <howieFelterbush> sainaen++
[11:13:07] <sainaen> howieFelterbush, "no need to run this every keyup" I keeped that because I didn't know is this list needs to be dynamic or not.
[11:13:37] <sainaen> kept*
[11:13:41] <howieFelterbush> totally reasonable
[11:14:06] <sainaen> howieFelterbush, and why are you using map instead of each()?
[11:14:28] <howieFelterbush> Planned to use .each, but I thought he would want to do something with the results.
[11:14:57] <howieFelterbush> other than just hide them. I wasn't sold on my solution, just suggesting there was a different way. Yours is much more elegant.
[11:17:17] <sainaen> howieFelterbush, but you didn't return anything from your map-function. `hiders` is always empty. :)
[11:19:25] <sdeseille> hello
[11:19:36] <howieFelterbush> plus I used $(this) about a dozen times. I was just suggesting an alternate path to take, as opposed to offering the final solution.
[11:22:00] <sdeseille> is it the right place to get help about jquery ?
[11:28:51] <tw2113> yes
[11:30:08] <LindsayMac> Does anyone here use espresso to code?
[11:30:33] <sdeseille> i work on some jquery code and something don't work like i want
[11:31:34] <_myth_> @sdeseille jquery code should work as u want it to be ... i suggest use OO concepts to write one that might help you make i neat ..
[11:32:20] <_myth_> i think the way to debug jquery code is using alert, but can anyone suggest any better way to debug jquery code? any tools
[11:33:28] <LindsayMac> _myth_: it depends on the issue, but you can use the Chrome inspector and create break points and walk through your code
[11:33:30] <sdeseille> i use also alert and in fact it seem that my click on a specific id don't rise the alarm popup
[11:34:36] <_myth_> then there must be some issue with your code, try checking that your function is hitting by writing simple code, and if it works fine then try to make it perfect as you want .. if there is any syntax error it might not work as you want it to be ..
[11:35:23] <_myth_> it happened with me too .. one i wrote complete code on click event nothing was happening, but eventually i found it to be syntax error ..
[11:35:33] <_myth_> without seeing code it is tough to say .. but that is my guess
[11:35:38] <sdeseille> can i explain to you my context ? i just want to know if what i want to do is possible
[11:36:07] <_myth_> sure.. may be i can help ... i am not expert but surly a developer who love to write code ..
[11:37:53] <sdeseille> i have a jquery fonction that create a conplete form when i click to an <img>. this work well and my form appear like i want.
[11:38:51] <sdeseille> in my form i have a button with a specific id and i want (when i click on it) to remove my form
[11:38:59] <_myth_> okie .. i guess you are adding complete form code in a div dynamically on image click ..
[11:39:01] <sdeseille> this last thing doesn't work
[11:39:10] <sdeseille> yes
[11:39:15] <sdeseille> it is right
[11:39:38] <Snerf> what is the 'last thing' ?
[11:40:03] <sdeseille> i don't succed to rise an alarm when i click on my button
[11:40:23] <Snerf> how are you handing the click event for the button?
[11:40:38] <_myth_> ok .. are you not even getting any click event for button? did you give your button an id?
[11:40:43] <sdeseille> i tried to put a button in another place on my body and then it work but it is not i want to do
[11:40:55] <sdeseille> yes
[11:41:11] <Snerf> I think you have to use .live to handle the click event
[11:41:27] <_myth_> i guess, when click event comes for button you need to clear the div having complete form ..
[11:41:45] <Snerf> because you have added the button after the DOM was created
[11:41:54] <phiz> .on
[11:42:03] <sdeseille> it is something i suppect
[11:42:07] <_myth_> yes .live is depricated .. .on is new one
[11:42:20] <Snerf> w/e.. it still works depending on what ver you use :)
[11:42:29] <Snerf> i stil use 1.7.2
[11:42:46] <phiz> well if you are going to implement new code, you might as well use non deprecated functions
[11:43:12] <sdeseille> hu i use 1.4.2
[11:43:23] <Snerf> in any case... thts what he still needs to do
[11:43:31] <Snerf> .on or .live
[11:44:04] <sdeseille> i'm not sure to understand
[11:44:14] <sdeseille> where i have to call this funtion
[11:44:23] <sdeseille> on my event click ?
[11:45:06] <Snerf> sdeseille, your button wont with with $('#button').click(function() { .. you need to use $('#button').live('click', function() {
[11:45:18] <sdeseille> ok thks
[11:45:28] <_myth_> something like this .. $('#loginbutton').live('click', function() {your code});
[11:45:41] <sdeseille> thks you too _myth_ ;)
[11:45:44] <_myth_> yes same as Snerf said
[11:46:02] <Snerf> because your button was created after the DOM was made.. .click wont work.. as the button was not created yet.. so the function isnt bound to the button
[11:47:07] <sdeseille> ok
[11:47:13] <_myth_> i think this is a good learning for all of us .... Thanks Snerf .. we should be careful in future ..
[11:47:51] <Snerf> its a very simple little issue... that leaves a lot of ppl puzzled :)
[11:48:38] <_myth_> yes .. agreed
[11:48:46] <sdeseille> hi ha it works !!! really big thanks to all
[11:48:51] <_myth_> in reality .. simple things are tough to find
[11:48:56] <_myth_> great ..
[11:49:03] <Snerf> glad to help
[11:49:15] <sdeseille> afk
[11:49:31] <phiz> $('#yourform').on("click","#loginbutton", function() { });
[11:49:36] <Snerf> but see.. he still uses 1.4.2... so .live was the one :)
[11:49:48] <_myth_> yes ..
[11:50:15] <_myth_> one doubt i have now Snerf ..
[11:50:34] <_myth_> should we always use .live instead of .click?
[11:50:35] <Snerf> but good to know that .on is the new one. I havent gone to update
[11:50:57] <Snerf> _myth_, no need.. .click works fine if your button is made in the DOM right away, not added later
[11:51:19] <Snerf> probably a 'slight' performance difference using .live :)
[11:51:25] <_myth_> ok
[11:51:45] <Snerf> since its not binding the function.. it looks for the button
[11:52:15] <Snerf> probably a very small difference.. but hey, it adds up
[11:53:55] <_myth_> great .. thanks
[11:54:30] <phiz> $('.element').click(function() {}); is the same as $('.element').on('click', function() {}); btw
[11:54:58] <phiz> in the sense that it only adds the handler one time to all elements with that .element class
[11:56:26] <phiz> even with older versions it is recommended to use .delegate() instead of .live() isn't it?
[11:57:09] <Snerf> i think so.. but it still works
[11:58:50] <spobat> explain this shit https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6559846/Screen%20Shot%202013-08-04%20at%208.58.24%20PM.png
[11:58:51] <spobat> :PP
[12:00:39] <RRR2> oh my gawd
[12:00:51] <RRR2> are you jQuerying a jQuery ojbect
[12:00:58] <RRR2> why
[12:01:36] <shoky> cause he prolly doesn't know about .eq(..)
[12:01:50] <spobat> because [4] hasn't a next() method
[12:01:51] <sainaen> spobat, in js [ ] != [ ], but [ ] == ""
[12:02:18] <spobat> RRR2: how to do it better?
[12:02:51] <shoky> spobat:  $('#channels-list').children().eq(4).next().length === 0
[12:03:44] <spobat> understood, thank you!
[12:07:59] <jgdfsmk> Hello!
[12:08:42] <howieFelterbush> wasn't .live deprecated a while back?
[12:09:09] <shoky> howieFelterbush: deprecated and removed, yes
[12:09:11] <tw2113> it was completely removed in 1.9 howieFelterbush
[12:09:51] <howieFelterbush> somebody needs to inform _myth_ and Snerf it looks like.
[12:10:14] <Snerf> howieFelterbush, if you did any reading.. the user was using 1.4.2 .. no need
[12:10:19] <tw2113> unless they're stuck on that old of a version
[12:10:27] <howieFelterbush> true that.
[12:10:43] <howieFelterbush> I don't know how to read, sorry
[12:10:51] <Snerf> apparently
[12:11:12] <howieFelterbush> It's a good thing I don't get upset easily when someone tries to help me out but was mistaken...
[12:12:03] <Snerf> he said it worked.. problem solved
[12:15:52] <kippi> hey
[12:16:01] <nam_94> Hey!
[12:16:41] <kippi> Just wondering if there is a obstacle for resizable
[12:17:27] <boytoy_> jquery ui resizable?
[12:17:41] <kippi> I am using jquery-ui-draggable-collision.min.js for draggable just wondering if there is the same thing for resizable,
[12:17:47] <kippi> boytoy_: yep
[12:18:29] <boytoy_> kippi: Good question but where's your jsbin?
[12:18:54] <boytoy_> I'm about to try out both as well so I'm very interested in your findings
[12:19:35] <kippi> more than happy to read up, I just can't find anything about resizable and obstacles
[12:19:56] <boytoy_> kippi: i mean like http://jsbin.com/ so we can all play with it
[12:28:00] <bobbobbins> hey, I'm still trying to find a solution to this: it works normally, but if I make this an ajax call, the 2 bind statements stop working‚Ä¶i tried moving the code and making it on() instead of bind, but the same thing keeps happening: https://gist.github.com/bobbobbins/6145470
[12:34:40] <IXTEN> hi guys, I made a function that does a ajax call to flick and get me some json. on success im trying to return a part of the json using "return". But if I check what it returned I always get "undefined". does anybody know what im doing wrong?
[12:35:37] <grafi>  show some code IXTEN
[12:36:14] <IXTEN> whats an url of those online notepads where I can post some code?
[12:37:53] <sainaen> IXTEN, you can't return data from callback. you need to pass it somewhere.
[12:38:10] <sainaen> IXTEN, http://jsfiddle.net
[12:39:10] <dabear> man, you should've thought people knew what ajax is, why it's async etc by now
[12:40:05] <IXTEN> grafi, http://jsfiddle.net/5rvyr/
[12:40:21] <IXTEN> I removed part of the url as this has api key's etc.
[12:41:08] <IXTEN> if I console.log json.photoset.photo I can see multiple objects containing info. But if I return it and then do a console log I just get undefined.
[12:41:23] <dabear> IXTEN: you need to console.log() it inside the callback
[12:41:33] <dannydagger> hey guys.. I got a jquery problem.. why does my site do this on first load? http://s16.postimg.org/a01m8c86d/firstloadbug.png    the link to my site is www.colorworld.se/testing123   and click the "portfolio" button to see the problem... when you refresh the page the problem is not there though
[12:41:51] <IXTEN> dabear, you mean inside the success part?
[12:41:56] <dabear> yup
[12:42:54] <dabear> IXTEN: all code that depends on the ajax result, must be called after the ajax has returned. best way to do that, is to put all code inside the success callback
[12:42:58] <IXTEN> dabear, I dont want to console log it. that is jsut for debugging. Flickr only returns every picture ID. I need to do another api call to get the actual url for an image. That is why I want to return the information to a global function
[12:43:44] <dabear> IXTEN: inside the success callback, you can call another (global) function with the results from the ajax call, if you wish
[12:44:28] <IXTEN> dabear, is there no way to just return the information? So I can minimize the function and make it more readable
[12:44:50] <IXTEN> I dont get it why its undefined as the infromation should just be an object or array with objects or something?
[12:44:51] <dabear> IXTEN: for all purposes, you should never do that
[12:45:18] <dabear> IXTEN: default value of a function that doesn't return a value, is undefined
[12:45:47] <dabear> ?jseval function foo(){ }; foo() //undefined
[12:46:49] <dabear> IXTEN: you cannot return from a function, after the function has executed, that's the whole issue. the ajax success call happens *AFTER* the sorrounding function has executed
[12:47:04] <dabear> that is, ajax is async
[12:48:11] <dabear> if it weren't( that is, if ajax was syncronious), all your other javascript code would be non-working(blocking) until after the ajax had been retrieved
[12:49:05] <IXTEN> ok thanks
[13:10:05] <bobbobbins> any help with my issue?
[13:10:35] <Cyclohexane> Is it possible to add after a html comment?
[13:11:36] <Snerf> Cyclohexane <!-- and -->
[13:11:51] <Cyclohexane> Snerf: I don't follow
[13:13:37] <Snerf> add those before and after your comment
[13:13:48] <Snerf> <!-- this is my comment -->
[13:14:43] <Cyclohexane> Snerf: how do I select it using jquery though? i want to add html after <!-- this is my comment --> *insert new HTML*
[13:14:47] <sainaen> Cyclohexane, do you mean insert element after comment?
[13:15:05] <Cyclohexane> sainaen: yes
[13:15:07] <sainaen> afaik, there is no way to do that.
[13:15:09] <Snerf> Cyclohexane, then you lost me.. i dont understand the question
[13:15:40] <Snerf> its a comment.. the DOM pretty much ignores it
[13:34:30] <Mrgoose> I have a listview inside of a panel , it works great when i open it on the first page.  However when i go to new pages the link to open the panel no longer executes.  Any ideas how ot get a persistent panel?
[13:52:35] <drager_> Can you make a div dragable using jquery ui? but I only want one div to be the area you "drag on" but another div moves.

[14:05:27] <IXTEN> hi guys, im using jquery.ajax to get some json from flickr. I noticed that if I get a fail from flickr the ajax still see's it as an success (as expected) but doesnt decode the json. why doesnt it decode the json?
[14:05:32] <IXTEN> the code: http://jsfiddle.net/5rvyr/2/
[14:06:10] <b0t> I just want to give you all my object class
[14:06:48] <grafi> I dont want your object class b0t :o
[14:06:56] <Snerf> IXTEN.. had a look at the data to see what the issue is?
[14:07:03] <b0t> :S
[14:07:18] <Snerf> IXTEN.. the data should tell the story
[14:07:20] <IXTEN> what console log outputs with correct id's is: Object {photoset: Object, stat: "ok"}
[14:07:22] <b0t> please help me my brother =)
[14:07:36] <grafi> IXTEN you convert json to obj and save it in obj but you never use it?
[14:07:37] <IXTEN> what it outputs with wrong id's: {"stat":"fail", "code":1, "message":"Photoset not found"}
[14:08:02] <IXTEN> so with wrong id's the ajax call is still a success so we still run in success: but the json is not decoded ?
[14:08:05] <grafi> b0t you already postet the answer to your own question o√¥
[14:08:15] <IXTEN> I noticed this casue I wanted to make a if check on stat
[14:09:20] <IXTEN> grafi, its not an object: {"stat":"fail", "code":1, "message":"Photoset not found"}
[14:09:36] <grafi> var obj = jQuery.parseJSON(json);
[14:09:51] <IXTEN> grafi, I know how to decode it. But why doesnt it already do this ?
[14:10:23] <Snerf> IXTEN.. maybe cuz it isnt properly sent
[14:10:55] <jordiescran> hey there. what exactly is the namespace in the jquery widget factory? is "widgetname.widgetname" going to get me into trouble?
[14:11:04] <grafi> probably
[14:11:09] <b0t> ∑<{grafi}>∑ www.pornux.net
[14:11:14] <b0t> check this videos
[14:11:50] <IXTEN> snerf, when flickr finds data from my id's the json is decoded . but when it doesnt find my id's the json is just a string and not decoded.
[14:12:12] <jordiescran> i don't understand why the widget name isn't just used as the "namespace". why add another layer?
[14:12:19] <Snerf> IXTEN. so then you need to catch the error.. maybe flicker isnt sending the data properly coded
[14:12:50] <grafi> keep that crap to yourself b0t o√¥
[14:13:26] <IXTEN> snerf, there is no error. The returned status is success so we run the success part and not the error part (see the code). But if I try to check the status variable in the json I notice the json is not decoded.
[14:14:33] <Snerf> and then you get an error, correct?
[14:15:22] <IXTEN> no, no error. I get an error when I try to get the stat variable from the json yes cause its just a string now.
[14:15:45] <Snerf> then you DO get an error.. thats where you trap it :)
[14:15:50] <b0t> ∑<{grafi}>∑ i love porn
[14:16:57] <IXTEN> Snerf, but why doesnt it decode the json? The request status is successful and it did get a json string. Why doesnt it decode it?
[14:17:30] <Snerf> I dont think you have a json string.. just a string that looks like it
[14:17:41] <Snerf> What I mean is ...I dont think you have a json object.. just a string that looks like it
[14:18:52] <IXTEN> Snerf, http://jsfiddle.net/5rvyr/3/
[14:19:03] <IXTEN> Snerf, I put the results in the html part
[14:19:50] <Snerf> and paste what a good one looks like..
[14:19:59] <IXTEN> I did
[14:20:10] <IXTEN> top one is the good one bottom one is bad one. Read the comments
[14:20:13] <Snerf> sorry..
[14:20:21] <Snerf> see how the 1st one is an Object...
[14:20:26] <Snerf> the 2nd isnt..
[14:20:34] <Snerf> its just a string
[14:20:38] <IXTEN> yes it is
[14:20:49] <Snerf> try dataType 'json'
[14:20:52] <Snerf> might help
[14:21:07] <IXTEN> ok so the second time it might just not understand its json output ?
[14:21:23] <Snerf> <shrugs>
[14:21:40] <Snerf> just a shot in the dark my friend.. gotta try the options
[14:22:04] <IXTEN> ok after setting the datatype to json manually it did decode the json.
[14:22:27] <Snerf> default isnt json.. so was worth adding it in there
[14:23:44] <IXTEN> How does it know when its json? Does it try to validate it and if it validates it knows the type?
[14:24:05] <Snerf> pretty much
[14:24:29] <Snerf> it just tries and see what it is, if you dont specify
[14:24:45] <Snerf> I always add the dataType.. then no guessing involved
[14:25:42] <IXTEN> I thought it would do it from the header with a content type
[14:26:09] <Snerf> you would think.. clearly not
[14:26:18] <Snerf> have had the same issues myself
[14:26:45] <IXTEN> well tnxs ;-) it helps understanding why something happens hehe :D
[14:27:11] <Snerf> np
[14:27:36] <lafannga> hello
[15:12:51] <KeyLimePi> Can anyone advise how to prevent an item from being clicked a second time after it was just clicked. Want to keep the animation from happening again if they just clicked on it once before
[15:13:22] <TheOceanMethod> KeyLimePi: set a flag and return from your clicked function if its set. when the animation ends, unset the flag
[15:14:20] <KeyLimePi> TheOceanMethod: What do you mean?I do want it to animate if another item is clicked and then that item is clicked agian. Just dont want the animation to be re-triggued when its clicked twice in a row
[15:14:59] <TheOceanMethod> right, so set a flag on the element: el.isAnimating = true;
[15:15:12] <TheOceanMethod> oh, do you not have any code at all?
[15:15:21] <TheOceanMethod> (beyond enabling the animation...)
[15:21:56] <bobbobbins> hey, i asked about this earlier but i still can't seem to find a solution‚Ä¶I have 2 jquery bind() calls that work fine normally, but when put into an ajax call, stop working‚Ä¶ i tried moving them and changing them to on() but its the same problem‚Ä¶here is the file‚Ä¶any help is greatly appreciated: https://gist.github.com/bobbobbins/6145470
[15:27:32] <Vivekananda> hello
[15:28:34] <Vivekananda> first question. Why are all tutorials I find , cover nothing of useful things that can be done with ajax and jquery. when I look for a tutorial I see just how create xmlhttp object and then do an open() and send ()
[15:29:29] <x86> because the useful stuff is generally done server-side, where the actual application is running that the web interface is, well, interfacing to via an API
[15:30:12] <Vivekananda> but I have spent 2 horrible days ( pretty dumb of me) to write a simple polling function and understand its steps. eg I know that I can use $.get() to send a get request. but I keep trying var x = $.get("myPage.html") ,
[15:30:18] <Vivekananda> and keeps giving me errors
[15:30:51] <shoky> Vivekananda: put your code on jsfiddle.net, explain what's happening
[15:30:54] <Vivekananda> I tried $.get("/myPage")
[15:31:11] <shoky> and?
[15:31:21] <Vivekananda> shoky okaay I will try but it is not something I can simplify
[15:31:34] <shoky> you just said it's a simple polling function
[15:31:44] <shoky> simple is good
[15:31:59] <Vivekananda> shoky: I am hoping it is but keeps eluding me and I keep going back to documentation to try to find an example
[15:32:11] <Vivekananda> in my head it is simple
[15:32:12] <shoky> Vivekananda:  $.get("myPage.html").done(function(data) { console.log(data) })
[15:32:12] <Vivekananda> :(
[15:33:41] <SageChaozu> @bobbobbins: Have you tried rebinding the events after the ajax postback? try doing it on the success of the ajax call.
[15:33:59] <bobbobbins> SageChaozu: yeah, i tried that, same result
[15:34:17] <Vivekananda> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/gyZAE/ the f*****g ( pardon the swear) keeps telling me [18:32:49.776] SyntaxError: missing variable name @ http://localhost:5000/static/myQuery.js:3
[15:34:24] <Vivekananda> headache !
[15:34:54] <bobbobbins> here is an actual demo of it‚Ä¶its on the last step though, so you have to go through the little wizard thing to get to it: http://166.78.127.31/c4e/round-calculator/
[15:35:22] <Vivekananda> shoky: could I request you to not queue in a lot of .this.that.whatever but help me figure out what is happening at each step so I can debug
[15:35:41] <Vivekananda> 2 days of hell over this ( sorry a bit cranky)
[15:38:06] <RRR2> lol
[15:38:33] <RRR2> I still don't know on what are you working
[15:38:39] <Vivekananda> RRR2: :) yep that is expected
[15:38:45] <Vivekananda> I was trying to tell you but you left
[15:38:54] <Vivekananda> not my fault !!
[15:39:00] <Vivekananda> :)
[15:39:06] <Vivekananda> but I can try again if you wish
[15:39:23] <RRR2> you could try telling me what are you doing
[15:39:29] <RRR2> and you can try posting some code
[16:14:42] <SageChaozu> @bobbobbins: when I evaluate $("#bursts").val() on that page, I get the result of NaN. Maybe the slider plugin is changing where to grab the actual value from?
[16:19:07] <SageChaozu> also on your page, the binding code seems to not be there
[16:19:24] <SageChaozu> I know you are loading your content in a div with html but I noticed the loaded HTML does not have the bind code there
[16:19:30] <SageChaozu> maybe something is not updated?
[16:27:52] <SageChaozu> @bobbobbins: I found your problem. You have your binding code on the page before the controls are loaded. Since the controls are not loaded, the event is not binded to the controls. That's why the controls are not working. You need to move your binding code to after the controls are loaded (maybe move it to the same page)
[16:28:12] <Vivekananda> RRR2: if you are still there here is what I am trying to do --http://imagebin.org/266541  and  http://imagebin.org/266542
[16:28:42] <Vivekananda> and currently trying to get the puple and grey flashcard boxes refreshed and updated for all clients using server polling
[16:28:54] <Tomashe> Hey guys i implemented jquery mobile on my website but seems like its not working
[16:29:04] <Tomashe> any special thing i need to do to initialize it ?
[16:29:19] <RRR2> i see
[16:30:51] * SageChaozu just noticed bobbobbins left already
[16:31:37] <RRR2> Do you cook?
[16:32:50] <bobbobbins> SageChaozu: hmm, i was messing with it, maybe i removed the bind argument‚Ä¶let me double check
[16:32:52] <Vivekananda> RRR2: so the use case is like this -- customer comes -- asks for chicken , M , 3 pieces + gives his phone and email --> the items are checked and name entered and submitted. --> a purple " todo" flash box is created and the order is also printed --> when order is done the purple box "done" button is checked to transfer it to the lower box ( change purple to grey color )
[16:33:54] <Vivekananda> that is the general scene. Right now I have printing not working
[16:34:26] <Vivekananda> also currently trying to set up the app so that a new db entry get updated for all clients windows not just the one who submits
[16:34:34] <Vivekananda> RRR2: did that make it clearer
[16:35:10] <RRR2> no
[16:35:42] <Vivekananda> ?? what is still unclear ? the app requirement ? use case ? or the polling necessity ?
[16:35:46] <bobbobbins> oops, yeah, i had removed it, I just put it back in‚Ä¶bursts is coming up as NaN for me too‚Ä¶but it wasn't before, let me look into that further
[16:36:12] <RRR2> Hmm
[16:36:34] <RRR2> Well, it seems I don't know what the context is
[16:36:39] <Vivekananda> for ?
[16:36:44] <Vivekananda> context for ?
[16:36:49] <Vivekananda> the need of the application ?
[16:37:02] <Vivekananda> or my being here ?
[16:37:04] <RRR2> the context of the code
[16:37:06] <Vivekananda> on jquery ?
[16:37:07] <Tomashe> $(document).bind( "mobileinit", function(event) {    $.extend($.mobile.zoom, {locked:true,enabled:false});});
[16:37:17] <Tomashe> i added that to prevent zoom but its not working
[16:37:22] <Vivekananda> which code ? the jquery I posted ?
[16:37:34] <RRR2> like I don't know what tools are you using, or what the server expects, or in general everything
[16:37:40] <RRR2> Aka IDK
[16:37:57] <Vivekananda> RRR2: I am using plain html js and css for the client and flask for the server
[16:38:08] <RRR2> flask?
[16:38:15] <Vivekananda> flask ( python)
[16:38:19] <Vivekananda> microframework
[16:38:21] <RRR2> Oh
[16:38:25] <RRR2> Didn't know that
[16:38:36] <Vivekananda> but it is no biggie is a simple thing to use
[16:39:06] <RRR2> what I think you should do is make the an API within the service
[16:39:10] <RRR2> to get the data
[16:39:11] <Vivekananda> a quick 1 page tutorial to get one started. It has a views.py which is the important part and redirects incoming url requests
[16:39:31] <Vivekananda> but I am already getting data
[16:39:36] <RRR2> maybe you can link the HTML if you can do that I could help there
[16:39:42] <Vivekananda> the only problem is the data are of two types
[16:39:46] <Vivekananda> sure
[16:39:48] <RRR2> but as the HTML?
[16:39:54] <Vivekananda> everything is right here
[16:40:09] <SageChaozu> now the problem is busrsts and seconds's val is eqauting to NaN
[16:40:18] <Vivekananda> https://bitbucket.org/vvikramjhu/basant/src
[16:40:47] <RRR2> the html is in the .py file?
[16:41:03] <Vivekananda> no
[16:41:12] <Vivekananda> all html is in here https://bitbucket.org/vvikramjhu/basant/src/d99cc1c24f008e44c19cdbb0dad1fed91a1920bd/app/templates?at=default
[16:41:22] <Vivekananda> inside app/templates/
[16:42:02] <Vivekananda> so how the workflow goes is like this --- html -- views.py - database - back to views -- html ( display )
[16:42:20] <bobbobbins> SageChaozu: yeah, it doesn't make any sense that they'd evaluate that way
[16:42:32] <Vivekananda> but all of that is might be complicated
[16:42:43] <RRR2> It is for me
[16:42:46] <RRR2> You wrote that?
[16:42:54] <RRR2> I don't know python.
[16:43:19] <Vivekananda> RRR2: okay I understand but my question is not for python or any language
[16:43:22] <Tomashe> i just dont get it
[16:43:23] <Vivekananda> I am only asking you
[16:43:36] <Vivekananda> if I say $.get(url) what will happen
[16:43:47] <Vivekananda> ie if I say var x = $.get(url)
[16:43:51] <Vivekananda> what does x get ?
[16:43:54] <Tomashe> that jquery mobile working only after compiling the html/js to an appliction , or its working when u load it on mobile devide
[16:44:02] <Tomashe> like safari browser from iphone?
[16:45:01] <RRR2> It gets a Jquerified object of XMLHttpRequest
[16:45:36] <Vivekananda> so now does it contain all info ( ie tags and included info) of the html page requested ?
[16:48:06] <RRR2> It contains the state of XMLHttpREquest
[16:48:27] <RRR2> it has all the properties of XMLHttpRequest and some methods added by Jquery
[16:48:40] <RRR2> where you can add events
[16:49:26] <RRR2> you can also access the headers of the response
[16:55:34] <Vivekananda> RRR2: okay now consider the scenario. I have an html page
[16:56:51] <Vivekananda> have a heavily nested div in it called myDiv and I do var x =('myDiv').htm(); also another page also has same div and I do  var y = $.get(url) ;
[16:57:05] <Vivekananda> now I want to find the div inside y and compare it to x
[16:57:07] <Vivekananda> how do I do this ?
[16:57:51] <RRR2> Vivekananda: strings don't have a html property/method
[16:58:22] <RRR2> is it $('myDiv') or ('myDiv')
[16:58:44] <Vivekananda> yes $('myDiv') sorry
[16:58:47] <Vivekananda> so the question remains
[17:01:08] <RRR2> it gets the innerHTML property of the DOM element
[17:07:41] <bobbobbins> argh, this thing is driving me mad
[17:21:39] <bobbobbins> i guess maybe its not an ajax issue, its doing it now even though i removed all the ajax
[17:23:32] <SageChaozu> I found the probelm
[17:23:44] <SageChaozu> it's the range you are giving for the sliders
[17:23:54] <SageChaozu> try this instead $("#seconds").simpleSlider({ 'range': [1,100], 'theme':'volume' });
[17:24:01] <SageChaozu> and change burst
[17:25:33] <SageChaozu> you had to actually give the range an array aka [1,100]
[17:25:42] <SageChaozu> once I changed that, everything started working
[17:26:15] <bobbobbins> ok, let me change that‚Ä¶thats odd, because it was working at one point
[17:27:36] <bobbobbins> ohh, you know what‚Ä¶i see what happened
[17:28:22] <bobbobbins> yeah, you're absolutely right‚Ä¶i had it set up in the element before i added the ajax, so it was data-slider-range="1,100", but when you switch it to actual javascript its different
[17:28:32] <SageChaozu> ohh
[17:28:35] <bobbobbins> wow, i'd have never caught that‚Ä¶you're a stud
[17:28:48] <SageChaozu> thnx, on that note I think its time to find dinner
[17:29:35] <bobbobbins> have a good one, thanks again
[17:29:42] <SageChaozu> no problem.. catch you later
[17:47:30] <nesoi> so I'm doing an app with JQM, and I'm finding that a textarea is somehow not wrapping properly when I type into it. What could cause that and what might fix it?
[17:52:51] <xfloyd> quick question about selectors
[17:53:10] <xfloyd> $('input:checkbox[name="line_tax[1]"]:checked').length  This selector works, but I need to use ‚Äúthis‚Äù bcause I‚Äôm in each loop. How to rewrite this selector, there is many checkboxes, I need to use wildcard to access them like: 'input:checkbox[name^=line_tax]‚Äô
[19:10:51] <feathersanddown> Hi
[19:17:59] <shoky> Vivekananda: sry had to go. still need ajax help?
[19:27:32] <RRR2> is there anyway to get only a jQuery function without getting the whole library
[19:30:38] <tw2113> read the jQuery source and copy/paste into your own
[19:35:32] <Vivekananda> shoky: yest still needed help
[19:35:44] <Vivekananda> RRR2: decided to help a bit
[19:36:02] <Vivekananda> and told me to use js as an api to get the info and parse it as data and then compare
[19:36:11] <Vivekananda> coz he sid somehow it would be easier to do
[19:36:17] <Vivekananda> I am trying to figure out how
[19:37:11] <RRR2> tw2113: Okay but you cannot simply copy paste jQuery methods
[19:37:24] <RRR2> tw2113: I know that because I've read jQuery source
[19:37:35] <RRR2> or parts of it
[19:40:13] <tw2113> what would stop you from copying the internal part of the method
[19:40:21] <tw2113> or at least determining the logic
[19:40:27] <tw2113> so that you can recreate
[19:40:51] <RRR2> well jQuery code is kinda hard to read
[19:41:00] <RRR2> all the variables are little letters
[19:41:09] <glen1> is there a js library to dealing with dates?
[19:41:12] <RRR2> and has functions with other littel letters
[19:42:41] <tw2113> RRR2, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/master/src
[19:45:32] <RRR2> It even seems more complicated to understand
[19:48:05] <RRR2> and it has reference all over jQuery.fn and other methods...
[19:48:17] <RRR2> It might take some time..
[20:09:46] <shoky> Vivekananda: if you still need help, re-ask your question
[20:15:51] <Vivekananda> shoky: yes sure
[20:15:55] <Vivekananda> gimme like a few mins please
[20:15:58] <Vivekananda> will that be okay
[20:16:34] <shoky> Vivekananda: i'm going to sleep in a few mins
[20:21:17] <Vivekananda> shoky: okay :(
[20:21:27] <Vivekananda> but could I ping you back in the day tomorrow then ?
[20:24:54] <shoky> Vivekananda: sure
[20:26:21] <HardDisk_WP> hey
[20:26:42] <HardDisk_WP> I'm setting $("#checkbox").attr("checked",true) or false respectively
[20:26:56] <HardDisk_WP> but the $("#checkbox").change() event doesnt get fired
[20:26:58] <HardDisk_WP> why?
[20:30:03] <shoky> HardDisk_WP: because the change event is only triggered automatically when the user changes it, not code
[20:30:15] <HardDisk_WP> mh okay
[20:30:28] <HardDisk_WP> any way to have it fired regardless of the way the value changes?
[20:30:54] <shoky>  $("#checkbox").prop("checked",true).trigger('change')
[20:31:11] <shoky> you can also just call .change()
[20:37:49] <Vivekananda> HardDisk_WP: is the syntax not like onchange ?
[20:38:13] <HardDisk_WP> hmm yeah, I'd like to avoid the extra call^^
[20:38:29] <nycjv321> hey I keep on getting an error that .dialog() is not a valid function: https://gist.github.com/nycjv321/0c4101ee9982754a66a6 any ideas?
[20:39:13] <gtek1k> hey
[20:40:31] <nycjv321> hey?
[21:07:33] <Moya_> :)
[22:04:49] <nycjv321> hello
[22:05:02] <nycjv321> what would be the reason for dialog() being an invalid method? on an id?
[22:05:26] <nycjv321> This is an invalid method call (apparently) $('#computer_serial_number').dialog({autoOpen: false})
[22:07:31] <Snerf> no
[22:07:58] <Snerf> do you have jqueryui added?
[22:13:17] <nycjv321> Snerf: how can I check?
[22:13:42] <nycjv321> Snerf: I know I can check for jquery. I believe its loaded I'm using a rails app
[22:13:44] <Snerf> by looking at your code. should be added in <script> tag, like jqeury :)
[22:13:51] <nycjv321> Snerf: :)
[22:14:03] <Snerf> well, its true.. my guess, its not...
[22:14:16] <Snerf> i dont use rails. so no idea about that
[22:14:33] <Snerf> but I would guess, jqueryui is not loaded
[22:16:36] <nycjv321> Snerf: you are a genius
[22:16:45] <Snerf> I know
[22:16:50] <nycjv321> :)
[22:17:11] <nycjv321> Snerf: I assumed <script src="/assets/jquery_ujs.js?body=1" type="text/javascript"></script> referred to jquery-ui.. it doesn't
[22:17:14] * nycjv321 <- is a noob
[22:17:35] <Snerf> sometimes.. its so simple you forget about that
[22:18:19] * nycjv321 hugs Snerf 
[22:18:28] <nycjv321> I just spent like 4 hours on this
[22:18:43] <nycjv321> I have to guess rails doesn't load jquery-ui to save resources?
[22:18:46] * nycjv321 facepalms
[22:19:09] <Snerf> no idea .. never used it
[22:19:41] <Snerf> but 4 hrs.. wow
[22:19:53] <mfoxdogg|work> indeed
[22:20:03] <nycjv321> lol
[22:20:15] <nycjv321> I was watching tv half the time also so not that bad ;)
[22:20:23] <mfoxdogg|work> rule #56 of coding - never make assumptions
[22:20:28] * nycjv321 needs to stop watching netflix 
[22:20:44] <Snerf> ah netflix does it again
[22:21:12] <Snerf> but ya. always good to make surer the library is loaded b4 ya use it :)
[22:25:27] <nycjv321> Snerf: :)
[22:25:43] <nycjv321> Snerf: I failed at programming rule #56
[22:25:57] * nycjv321 wallows in shame
[22:28:01] <zChris> Hello, can several element have the same name ?
[22:28:38] <nycjv321> zChris: what do u mean?
[22:28:47] <zChris> <tr name="adress">
[22:28:50] <zChris> Like that
[22:29:57] <mfoxdogg|work> yes
[22:30:08] <mfoxdogg|work> thoughhh it can be confusing
[22:30:42] <zChris> I have three of those tr's. But when i do tr[name=adress] it only returns one of them ?
[22:32:31] <zChris> It should return all of them right ?
[22:35:58] <mfoxdogg|work> you are better off using a class in that case
[22:37:10] <zChris> alright i give that a try
[22:38:44] <zChris> mfoxdogg|work, weird it stills only select one
[22:39:05] <mfoxdogg|work> try 'tr .class'
[22:39:21] <mfoxdogg|work> if tyhat dosn't work, paste the line here please
[22:40:26] <zChris> mfoxdogg|work, alert($(".aAdress").each().html());
[22:40:38] <zChris> <tr class="aAdress" style='display:none'> x 3
[22:43:01] <nycjv321> Snerf: I got it all working :) I made a function to encapsulate creating dialog windows on element clicks its all working now woot woot. Thanks again!!
[22:47:16] <mfoxdogg|work> zChris, alert($(".aAdress).each(function() { $(this).html();});
[22:53:59] <zChris> mfoxdogg|work, ill try that in a sec
[22:59:03] <zChris> mfoxdogg|work, thanks that worked like a charm
[23:05:15] <{DV8}> anyone able to help me towards testing whether an image class contains "wp-image[xyz]" and then $("img").parent("a").addClass("[class]");  ?
[23:24:41] <Cork> {DV8}: http://jsfiddle.net/hv62t/
[23:25:08] <Cork> hmm, no that's wrong
[23:25:30] <Cork> {DV8}: http://jsfiddle.net/hv62t/1/
[23:37:56] <jop008> Any help on this https://forum.jquery.com/topic/css-rotating-content-not-in-line-with-parent-elements ?
[23:41:43] <Cork> jop008: you can't with transform
[23:41:58] <Cork> it doesn't take the pageflow into account when it modifies content
[23:43:34] <glen1> has anyone used fullcalendar?
[23:44:43] <jop008> So what to do then if transform is not the way 2 go?
[23:44:54] <jop008> Use SVG?
[23:45:33] <jop008> can I not check it with parent width and height?
[23:45:47] <Cork> jop008: if you use transform you would have to calculate how the dimensions of the image changes, and add negative and positive margins to account for it
[23:46:08] <Cork> jop008: the width/height of the parent doesn't change
[23:46:16] <Cork> like i said, the pageflow isn't modified
[23:46:34] <Cork> (meaning no other element is moved or resized cause of the transform)
[23:46:47] <jop008> But when elements got hidden can I make them visible again?
[23:46:56] <Cork> yes
[23:47:13] <Cork> you would have to calculate how the transfrom modifies the element
[23:47:20] <Cork> and add margins to account for that change
[23:47:46] <Cork> ex if the image becomes wider add a left and right margin to push the element out from under the image
[23:48:08] <jop008> so origin has a width and heigt and after the transform a new width and height
[23:48:15] <Cork> no
[23:48:37] <Cork> after the transform the dom element has the same width and height, but the rendered element has a new width and height
[23:48:58] <Cork> and that is why you get covered elements
[23:49:41] <jop008> okay and the width of the rendered element I know because of the  rotation
[23:50:43] <jop008> so using style:margin-top=
[23:52:44] <raj> anyone that's used blueimp's jquery-fileupload know how I can bind to the event of all downloads being done?
[23:52:48] <jop008> margin-top:100px; and margin-left has to be used
[23:52:52] <raj> don't see it here https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Options
[23:53:49] <raj> I was under the impression submit would only run once
[23:54:05] <raj> it runs for each file though (in a multi-file upload)
[23:59:54] <zChris> If a element like <tr> has display:none first does is not inherit css from the parent?
