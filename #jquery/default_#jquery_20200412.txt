[07:30:09] <monkeyCode> Hi I just tried to create an account on the jQuery forum but it always get stuck after I authenticate using Google. Is the jQuery forum server down?

[07:44:50] <monkeyCode> I'm having problem making my jQuery UI calendar run on my HandleClickEvent when clicking on the calendar date buttons. The handler only runs when I click outside of the current dates.

[23:36:45] <errorous> howdy. Is there a jquery or vanilla js method I could use to extract keys from an array?
[23:39:13] <shoky> errorous: arrays donâ€™t have keys. if you mean an object,  Object.keys(obj)
[23:39:33] <errorous> shoky sorry, indexes
[23:39:46] <shoky> errorous: what do you mean by extracting indexes..?
[23:40:50] <errorous> let a = [ 'one', 'two', 'three' ]; delete a[1]; // get [0,2]
[23:41:19] <shoky> it still has 0,1,2 as indexes
[23:46:00] <shoky> (the indexes are always 0 .. a.length)
[23:46:07] <shoky> a.length-1 that is
[23:47:13] <shoky> errorous: though, Object.keys(a) seems to do what you wanted..
[23:52:55] <errorous> shoky thanks!
