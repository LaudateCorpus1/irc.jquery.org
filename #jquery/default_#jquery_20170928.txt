[04:24:30] <W0LF> anyone have luck getting the headroom module to work with d8? i've installed it and added the headroomjs library as described, but still don't get the classes added on scroll
[04:29:15] <Cork> W0LF: most likely wrong channel
[04:34:41] <W0LF> Cork : well it's a js jquery issue i think, as there seems to be a naming error with whether the files should be .js or .min.js
[04:34:47] <W0LF> but i can't figure it out
[04:35:23] <Cork> W0LF: jquery doesn't care about files
[04:36:01] <Cork> as long as the browser loads the resource into the javascript context it's happy
[04:36:28] <Cork> you can call the url my_magic_snowflake.iso if you like
[04:39:34] <Al_nz1> I am using eonasdan date picker ( https://eonasdan.github.io/bootstrap-datetimepicker/Events/ ) and I have button pn the page to dynamically add more date pickers, but the change event doesnt seem to fire on the new pickers? jquery tags match on the added pickers : $('.form-control.dob.person').on('dp.change', function(event) {
[04:41:19] <Cork> Al_nz1: make a jsfiddle with the code you're trying to get working
[04:43:11] <AdamPDotty> Probably a case where you need a container to attach the handler to.
[04:43:14] <Al_nz1> Cork: I think its to do with binding the events to the cloned date pickers : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42438944/onchangedate-not-triggering-on-cloned-datepicker-objects
[04:43:23] <Al_nz1> if I cant make sense of that I will do a fiddle
[04:43:57] <AdamPDotty> Something like: $('form').on('dp.change', '.form-control.dob.person', function(event){
[04:46:12] <Al_nz1> AdamPDotty: its working, just not on cloned pickers
[05:23:40] <d3xter> hey guys, I want to have a drop-down with filter (just like select2.js), but instead of having the selected items inside the select, i want them to place them in a seperate table beneath. How would i do that?
[05:24:28] <Cork> d3xter: simplest is prob just to bind the change event on the select2 and set it in the second position
[05:29:14] <fn> Cork: do you always you plugins/scripts like select2.js or create your own?
[05:29:35] <Cork> fn: i don't use form field replacers
[05:29:36] <fn> have the problem with a slider.js that doesn't support all my needs and not sure if i should write my own or extend the slider.js
[05:29:51] <fn> select2.js was just an example, sorry.
[05:29:55] <Cork> if i did i would use an existing one if there is one where i like the code design
[05:30:29] <Cork> fn: my criteria for using a lib is that "if they would stop maintaining it i would be willing to support it my self"
[05:30:54] <Cork> if i can't follow the code or the style is horrible i won't use it
[05:31:01] <Cork> no matter how "neet" the result is
[05:31:13] <fn> i see your point
[05:31:33] <Cork> it is also to keep problems out of the code
[05:31:46] <Cork> if you can easily follow the code of the plugin it most likely is quite bug free
[05:32:12] <Cork> if it isn't you are likely to break it left right and center as soon as you start using it in a way they didn't think of
[05:32:29] <fn> how much time do you spend to evaluate a plugin/script?
[05:32:54] <Cork> and then it might be very much work to stop using it (not least evangelize for other ppl in the company why we are going to lose the feature)
[05:33:10] <Cork> fn: depends on the complexity of the lib
[05:33:34] <Cork> but if the plugin is too complex for what i need from it that will be the first chopping block
[05:33:47] <fn> hm okay
[05:33:58] <Cork> say if i can write it my self in about 100-200 locs and it is 2000
[05:34:11] <Cork> then i most likely will punt on the lib and write it my self
[05:34:12] <fn> locs = lines?
[05:34:18] <Cork> Lines Of Code
[05:34:21] <fn> ah
[05:34:52] <Cork> and this is for example why i never use the jquery.validator
[05:35:15] <Cork> i can write the validation i need in about 3-10 locs and it is what 3000?
[05:35:39] <fn> frontend form validation :x
[05:35:58] <Cork> well it is just ui "looks nice"
[05:36:05] <Cork> it isn't for preventing anything
[05:36:23] <Cork> and also to speed things up
[05:36:34] <Cork> why send it to the server for validation if js can catch it directly
[05:36:37] <fn> doesn't support html5 form validation?
[05:36:52] <Cork> sure, but there are limits to what you can do with those
[07:15:23] <spongie> Hiya. I'm currently using the jquery ui to fancy up my interfaces, I noticed that disabled inputs don't look any different from enabled ones. Is there a way to change the background color to indicate that the input is disabled?
[07:17:08] <Cork> spongie: uh, jquery ui doesn't change the look of the input fields (at least not as far as i know)
[07:18:31] <spongie> Cork: that is true. looks like it's my select2 plugin.
[07:22:23] <spongie> Cork: even more doh, i was changing the wrong css.
[07:22:54] <spongie> If I change any attributes for the input firefox will render it like a square bordered input instead of the nice looking default with rounded corners.
[07:23:10] <spongie> not a jquery issue tho, imma google for that.
[07:24:07] <Cork> spongie: ya, its by spec
[07:24:38] <Cork> browsers are suppose to flip apperance: none when styling properties is changed on them
[07:24:59] <Cork> (chrome doesn't style there input fields at all so you don't see it there)
[07:28:53] <spongie> Is there a way to style them using jquery so they look the same as the buttons and selects?
[08:18:26] <Cork> spongie: not really
[08:18:45] <Cork> spongie: you can custom style them completely for the page
[08:19:15] <Cork> spongie: but the default look is removed cause the look is images taken from the system theme and they can't change them freely
[08:31:06] <spongie> Cork: right. I'm just trying to make the text inputs look like the buttons and dropdowns
[09:27:41] <poboy> this is from a jsplugin https://kopy.io/Tum7r  and I'm not entirely sure what it's doing but it's pushing all delete buttons into the top table cell.  https://pasteboard.co/GMsFHxO.png   any thoughts?
[10:11:09] <diony> hey all i need some help
[10:11:44] * localh0st is warming up his wizard ball
[10:12:01] <diony> onClick How to check text from each div in #container and compare to #container2 span.mycountname,  if this is true addClass to span in #containter https://jsfiddle.net/y29a753n/
[10:12:27] <diony> or onLoad does not matter
[10:12:51] <localh0st> diony: on click on what?
[10:13:09] <diony> localh0st: onload really
[10:13:48] <Cork> diony: you mean on('click' on the a element?
[10:14:13] <diony> Cork: sorry its when page loads
[10:14:23] <Cork> what?
[10:14:33] <diony> onload
[10:15:09] <Cork> diony: add some code showing what you're trying to do
[10:19:16] <localh0st> diony: man, you html is not valid at all
[10:19:19] <localh0st> <div class="#container2">
[10:19:21] <localh0st> what is that?
[10:19:41] <Uhkis> completely valid html, just a really weird name
[10:20:10] <localh0st> Uhkis: how would you select such element?
[10:20:18] <localh0st> with some escaping?
[10:20:34] <localh0st> or maybe $(".#container2") ?
[10:21:11] <Cork> localh0st: see perfectly valid :) https://jsfiddle.net/y29a753n/1/
[10:21:16] <xec> maybe $(".\\#container2") ?
[10:21:39] <Cork> xec: correct
[10:21:52] <Uhkis> localh0st: https://jsfiddle.net/5t1tn7mw/ works fine! :D
[10:21:57] <Cork> basically nothing is invalid in css  selectors >_>
[10:22:08] <xec> just really really messy xD
[10:22:12] <Cork> yup
[10:23:14] <diony> hey guys working on js example for your review
[10:23:24] <Cork> review? :D
[10:25:15] <diony> hey localh0st: and Cork: check updated example, I was trying to go via this path https://jsfiddle.net/y29a753n/2/
[10:26:17] <Cork> diony: there is no onload event handler there
[10:28:03] <localh0st> diony: https://jsfiddle.net/o2gxgz9r/15667/
[10:28:20] <Cork> 15667 ??
[10:28:51] <localh0st> Cork: why not? :D
[10:28:54] <localh0st> https://jsfiddle.net/o2gxgz9r/15668/
[10:29:12] <Cork> thought about using separate fiddles for each question? >_>
[10:29:40] <diony> localh0st: thank you :)
[10:29:51] <diony> cork: thank you too
[10:29:58] <diony> I think i can work with this
[10:30:09] <localh0st> Cork: I don't like to attach jquery to each fiddle, I've got some in my browser history that popup when typing 'jsf..' ;p
[10:32:23] <diony> this community really rocks thank you all
[10:36:00] <Cork> diony: but ya, you sould prob replace class="#container1" and class="#container2" with id="container1" and id="container2"
[10:36:12] <Cork> would make everything much more palatable
[11:07:57] <diony> Cork: thank you i cleaned it up
[12:52:24] <plamb> I'm trying to filter this json object based on the value of one of the keys

[12:52:30] <plamb> what am i doing wrong?
[12:53:18] <plamb> oh wait
[12:53:21] <plamb> that works, lol
[12:53:25] <robertmaxrees> heh..,.
[12:53:28] <robertmaxrees> was about to say.
[12:53:31] <plamb> wasnt working in my code
[12:54:01] <plamb> ok so say i want to access the "ram" property of the resulting array
[12:54:03] <plamb> would it be
[12:54:07] <plamb> instanceData[0].ram ?
[12:54:23] <robertmaxrees> did you try that? :)
[12:54:50] <plamb> looks like what i was missing was the [0]
[12:54:58] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  filter returns an arrayu.
[12:55:01] <robertmaxrees> *array
[15:12:31] <taplar> bow chicka wow wow
[15:12:46] <robertmaxrees> holla
[15:13:10] <taplar> super slow in here today
[15:13:23] <robertmaxrees> i feel like it's been kinda slow lately overall.
[15:21:15] <Al_nz1> I can fix that
[15:21:52] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[15:22:49] <grapheti> gettin' naughty in jquery
[15:23:05] <grapheti> > taplar  bow chicka wow wow
[15:23:22] <taplar> watcha gonna say?
[15:23:54] <grapheti> https://youtu.be/9Wl_uQOABxg?t=25s
[15:23:57] <grapheti> That's what!
[15:26:02] <taplar> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWfUp70XMLI
[15:28:54] <grapheti> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQlIhraqL7o
[15:29:09] <Al_nz1> I have a line var val = parseInt($(this).val()); - which occasionaly evaluates to NaN. If I then test val===NaN i get false?
[15:29:35] <robertmaxrees> because https://jsfiddle.net/quvuvL48/
[15:29:40] <robertmaxrees> NaN doesn't equal NaN
[15:29:51] <robertmaxrees> you can do if (!val) { tho.
[15:29:55] <taplar> parseInt(this.value || "0")
[15:30:11] <taplar> parseInt(this.value.trim() || "0")
[15:30:23] <robertmaxrees> also make sure you pass the radix.
[15:30:28] <taplar> ^
[15:30:36] <robertmaxrees> parseInt(this.value.trim() || "0", 10)
[15:30:55] <grapheti> NaN lied to me. It is a number.
[15:31:09] <robertmaxrees> It's Numeric Not A Number D:
[15:31:20] <grapheti> LOL
[15:32:36] <robertmaxrees> typeof NaN returns "number"
[15:32:38] <robertmaxrees> it'
[15:32:44] <robertmaxrees> *it's not equal to itself.
[15:32:45] <robertmaxrees> and it's lol.
[15:32:49] <grapheti> lol
[15:32:51] <grapheti> yup
[15:33:08] <grapheti> Makes me laugh so hard every time.
[15:33:11] <robertmaxrees> also: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4w50bLoa/
[15:34:41] <taplar> must be falling back to pointer comparisons
[15:34:48] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:35:17] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4w50bLoa/1/
[15:36:06] <Al_nz1> thanks i will try !val
[15:36:14] <taplar> ...
[15:37:05] <robertmaxrees> lel
[15:37:27] <taplar> it fits the pattern.  been one of those days already
[15:37:38] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[16:08:34] <Al_nz1> this was working in that it would count the questions not answered - now I put some of the questions inside a panel body and the line $('.select.risk select:visible'); no longer finds the visible selects inside the panelbody?
[16:09:33] <Al_nz1> .select.risk is a class on the panel body
[16:09:47] <taplar> that's two classes
[16:10:05] <taplar> class="select risk"
[16:10:32] <Al_nz1> thats what I mean
[16:10:34] <Al_nz1> meant
[16:11:15] <taplar> console.log($('.select.risk select').length);
[16:13:14] <Al_nz1> looks like it says its null
[16:13:35] <taplar> it will be a number, not null
[16:14:57] <Al_nz1> its saying it is
[16:15:03] <Al_nz1> typed directly onto console
[16:15:09] <taplar> not the console
[16:15:12] <taplar> put it in your code
[16:15:12] <Al_nz1> $('select.risk').length
[16:15:18] <Al_nz1> ok
[16:15:53] <taplar> and you left off the period in front of the select in that selector you pasted
[16:21:43] <Al_nz1> brb
[16:22:57] <Al_nz1> hmm, seems to work in fiddle
[16:22:59] <Al_nz1> back to local
[16:44:09] <Al_nz1> taplar: locally ('.select.risk').length returns 3 because I have 3 panels with class="select risk" - but then when I add in the '.select.risk select' I get 0 - almost like its not likeing multiple panels with selects in it
[16:44:38] <robertmaxrees> what does the markup look like?
[16:44:47] <taplar> that's saying there are no nested select elements
[16:46:07] <electriX> VX hi
[16:46:20] <VX> hmm
[16:47:21] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees : https://pastebin.com/nQhpy45R
[16:47:57] <Al_nz1> the .select.risk is there on panel body then there are selects within that
[16:48:19] <taplar> not in that paste
[16:48:22] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:48:33] <robertmaxrees> .select.risk doesn't have any child selects.
[16:48:33] <Al_nz1> whats not in that paste?
[16:48:50] <taplar> the only child of the select risk is blah blah blah
[16:48:50] <robertmaxrees> there are no selects under .select.risk in that paste.
[16:48:57] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[16:49:37] <electriX> get it together
[16:49:42] <Al_nz1> because of the closing div on panel body?
[16:49:48] <taplar> lol
[16:49:51] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 uh
[16:50:00] <robertmaxrees> because it's a separate element entirely?
[16:50:11] <robertmaxrees> it's even in a different row.
[16:50:37] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what .select.risk select'
[16:50:43] <robertmaxrees> *^ what what's trying to select?
[16:51:09] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees : I see the problem - that html is poked - working on it
[16:51:18] <robertmaxrees> rad
[16:51:23] <Al_nz1> thanks
[16:54:03] <Al_nz1> and you guys were complaining it was too quiet here. seesh
[16:54:21] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:55:03] <taplar> quiet is one thing.  saying something is a child is another
[16:59:28] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:59:48] <taplar> the selector confusion
[17:04:11] <Al_nz1> does the change event fire before or after the value has changed?
[17:05:38] <taplar> after focus is lost
[17:06:26] <Al_nz1> hmm, so it should be the new value
[17:08:12] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:10:15] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3tpekdrt/
[17:10:18] <robertmaxrees> easy test case fwiw
[17:26:20] <Al_nz1> anyoe see whats wrong with the logic to count the questions which arent answered : https://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/w4avu3er/93/
[17:35:40] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/w4avu3er/95/
[17:37:05] <Al_nz1> right so you changed the test....
[17:39:12] <Al_nz1> trying to understand whats going on now
[17:41:10] <Al_nz1> so the trim removes whitespace
[17:42:01] <Al_nz1> but you have parseInt(this.value.trim() || "0", 10); - how does the trim() || "0' work?
[17:42:26] <taplar> if the left side is falsey, it uses the right side
[17:42:45] <taplar> blank is falsey
[17:43:34] <robertmaxrees> it's to protect you from passing an empty string to parseInt
[17:43:44] <Al_nz1> so instead of blank resulting in Nan, blank now results in 0?
[17:43:49] <robertmaxrees> yes
[17:44:22] <Al_nz1> and the 10 is the radix (base?)
[17:44:25] <robertmaxrees> yes
[17:45:17] <robertmaxrees> that's to protect you in the instances where somebody tries to pass, say, '0567' - a preceding 0 makes some browsers think that's octal instead of decimal.  passing the radix prevents that bug.
[17:45:55] <Al_nz1> so a 1 still gets passed as a 1, a 0 still gets passed as 0, but no value now is also a 0?
[17:46:05] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[17:47:11] <Al_nz1> right,then further down on notanswered you running a similar test, but testing for trim being ''
[17:47:29] <Al_nz1> ok, I follow it now
[17:47:45] <taplar> cause '0' is obscure as to if it was not selected or was no
[17:48:05] <taplar> you have to check for blank specifically
[17:48:05] <robertmaxrees> ^ it's all about type safety.
[17:48:32] <Al_nz1> yes, not a straightfoward as one might think
[17:48:39] <robertmaxrees> the concept is that you want methods/functions/conditionals/etc returning consistent types.
[17:48:48] <robertmaxrees> and expected values.
[17:52:56] <Al_nz1> and why was !val not working as expected?
[17:55:50] <taplar> "cause '0' is obscure as to if it was not selected or was no "
[17:56:00] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:56:02] <taplar> !NaN === !0
[17:56:09] <robertmaxrees> explicit rather than implicit.
[18:00:31] <robertmaxrees> to make things even more explicit, you could create functions with names like isAnswered, answerValue, etc.
[19:01:09] <Al_nz1> whats a good way to approach this,so that any red question answered true (1) overrides the score to HIGH?
[19:01:15] <Al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/w4avu3er/101/
[19:02:14] <Al_nz1> I can add another if block, but there might be a more elegent way?
[19:03:39] <robertmaxrees> if block where?
[19:04:47] <robertmaxrees> also: you can condence the high school/elementary school blocks.
[19:05:21] <Al_nz1> I will adjust the fiddle to show how I could do it
[19:14:15] <Al_nz1> Here : https://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/w4avu3er/103/
[19:14:38] <Al_nz1> the scoremight only be 1,but because a red question was answered true, it should override to HIGH - but doesnt
[19:15:08] <Al_nz1> I presume tracking the number of redquestions is the right approach,its just a case of the override
[19:18:21] <Al_nz1> ok, wait forget that for a moment
[19:18:30] <Al_nz1> I need to select red questions. duh
[19:40:19] <Al_nz1> anyone see why this hasClass isnt picking up red-label ?
[19:43:15] <Al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/w4avu3er/108/
