[00:45:52] <paulvd> I am trying to pass a php variable to js, but I always get an error, here is the code I am using >> http://pastebin.com/fc58tpRR
[00:46:14] <paulvd> ReferenceError: test is not defined var name = test-page;
[00:46:16] <paulvd> here is the error

[00:47:19] <oftl> i have some nested nodes and i want a click event only triggered when the outer node is clicked and not when an inner node is. how would i do that ?
[00:47:26] <oftl> a minimal example is here:  https://jsfiddle.net/sp8nb496/4/
[00:49:29] <oftl> (also: i like that jsfiddle thingy. used it for the first time and i must say: it is helpful :-)
[00:52:07] <oftl> except for .remove(); i'm wondering if there is another way ?!
[00:56:46] <Cork> oftl: https://jsfiddle.net/sp8nb496/5/
[01:01:26] <oftl> Cork: cool, thanks!
[01:22:21] <durdenk> using bootstrap template and toogle buttons, once tooggled button gets active class, function bind to that button runs before that active class append.
[01:22:30] <durdenk> did you get it?
[01:27:06] <paulvd> I have a variable var name and a list of items, how can i select that variable frm the list
[01:27:54] <Cork> paulvd: show the code
[01:28:41] <paulvd> i'll make a fiddle.
[01:34:06] <paulvd> http://jsfiddle.net/rLevvL20/1/
[01:34:13] <paulvd> Basically I want to remove that menu item "Test"

[01:46:43] <oftl> paulvd: your if statement looks funny
[01:46:59] <OnceMe> Hello, is there some open source service or whatever where I can show map and marker on a location based from country name?
[01:47:28] <slax0r> google maps api?
[01:47:31] <Uhkis> openstreetmaps?
[01:47:34] <slax0r> oh, open source
[01:47:37] <slax0r> missed that part
[01:47:55] <paulvd> Uhkis: thanks
[01:48:36] <Uhkis> paulvd: you were missing the second = from the if statement
[01:49:00] <OnceMe> is google maps api free?
[01:49:52] <Cork> OnceMe: yes
[01:50:14] <Uhkis> not open source tho
[01:51:02] <Cork> also they will track the hell out of you and you're customers
[01:51:51] <Cork> well it is "free" as in "no cost" it isn't free as in libre
[02:02:29] <OnceMe> can I search by name of country/city/whatever on google maps?
[02:13:39] <shanee> Hello. I'm looking to unbind a blur event and later rebind it. It's part of a theme so I don't have access to change the anonymous function bound to blur. Is this possible without using $_data?
[02:21:07] <Cork> shanee: no not really
[02:21:56] <Cork> shanee: and you aren't really meant to handle logic by adding and removing event handlers
[02:22:12] <Cork> that should be in the event listener
[02:25:21] <shanee> Yes. Although it's not really possible in this case as we can't edit that code.
[02:26:06] <shanee> Thanks Cork. I don't think it's possible to bind a blur event that triggers before the other to use event.stopImmediatePropergation either is it?
[02:31:18] <Cork> ah, ya so a broken plugin or something
[02:31:41] <Cork> ya, it is really annoying when a developer things only where objective will ever be what needs to be supported
[02:31:48] <Cork> thinks even
[02:32:38] <Cork> shanee: i guess you could overload the $.fn.blur or $.fn.on before it calls
[02:32:41] <Cork> + it
[02:32:54] <Cork> and then restore it after and just store the functions in an array
[02:33:18] <Cork> *i would give it a fake event object where stopImmediatePropagation doesn't do anything)
[02:37:02] <surianup> how can I access the json ojbect please
[02:37:33] <surianup> I have to access this object
[02:37:59] <surianup> {"error_login":{"password":["The password must be at least 8 characters."]}}
[02:41:35] <shanee> Cork, I never thought of that. I was going to hack it with $_data. $.fn.blur is called for every blur event? So if there's others presumably it will need to check the element and either do nothing or run as normal right?
[02:42:13] <Cork> shanee: no
[02:42:38] <Cork> shanee: if they do $('selector').blur() you can overload that function to catch there event bind request
[02:44:00] <Cork> something like var broken_handler, org_blur = $.fn.blur; $.fn.blur = function(handler) { broken_handler = handler; }; /* let the bind code run */ $.fn.bind = org_blur;
[02:44:07] <shanee> Cork, Ok. Is there documentation on $.fn.blur? I'm not really sure I understand it. In this case it would be the user bluring it rather than jquery being used to trigger the blur also. Would it work then?
[02:48:43] <shanee> Ah. I think I understand (sort of) now. Thank you. I'll try.
[02:50:46] <surianup> {"error_login":{"password":["The password must be at least 8 characters."]}}  how to access this
[02:50:48] <surianup> please help me
[02:51:37] <surianup> I am trying to access in the sucess function

[02:59:15] <CocoStorm> Hey
[02:59:58] <CocoStorm> How do I check state of .toggle() ? I'd like to see whether it's on or off , is this possible without having to mess around with adding / removing classes?
[03:06:00] <CocoStorm> Hey guys how do I check state of .toggle() ? I'd like to see whether it's on or off , is this possible without having to mess around with adding / removing classes?
[03:07:27] <d3m0n> Should this not work? http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/gpJNyN I see no error and it's also not appending.
[03:07:52] <Uhkis> CocoStorm: $(element).is(':hidden') should work
[03:11:06] <CocoStorm> Uhkis: doesn't work
[03:11:12] <CocoStorm> I'm not hiding or displaying anything
[03:12:20] <Uhkis> CocoStorm: well that's what toggle does
[03:12:32] <CocoStorm> Uhkis: what does it do?
[03:12:44] <CocoStorm> I have a toggle() function
[03:12:58] <Uhkis> https://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[03:12:59] <CocoStorm> so that it does different things depending on whether its on/off
[03:13:13] <CocoStorm> so toggle(functiona, functionb)
[03:14:54] <CocoStorm> hmm I'll stick to the adding removing classes solution
[03:18:36] <Cork> CocoStorm: there is .is(':visible')
[03:18:48] <Cork> but ya toggleClass is cleaner if you ask me
[03:18:58] <CocoStorm> Great, thanks :)
[03:19:40] <Cork> also toggle with two functions are an old solution that was removed in 1.9+
[03:19:54] <Cork> and isn't related to toggling display
[03:20:39] <Cork> (i personally think toggle should be removed in favor of toggleClass, but that's just me)
[03:20:51] <Cork> same with show/hide
[03:21:48] <Uhkis> that would conflict with 'write less, do more' ;)
[03:22:11] <Cork> not really
[03:22:40] <Cork> it would just push for do it right with same amount of code
[03:22:51] <Uhkis> toggleClass('hidden') + the css vs. hide()
[03:23:01] <Uhkis> clearly way more to write with the former option!
[03:23:23] <Cork> so do $.fn.hide = function() { this.addClass('hidden') };
[03:23:33] <Uhkis> even more to write!
[03:23:47] <Cork> it could be the change from when it gets removed
[03:24:58] <Uhkis> also those are animated with the speed parameter
[03:25:13] <Cork> my problem is that jquery today pushes quite hard for ppl to write all the css inside js
[03:25:21] <Cork> and that is a really bad idea
[03:25:29] <Uhkis> that's true
[03:25:45] <Cork> it should be more pushy for the thought that css belonges in your style.css
[03:26:04] <Cork> if you want to do it the other way, find you will have to write more code to do it, but we won't prevent you
[03:26:12] <Cork> find==fine
[03:26:19] <Cork> anyway afk
[03:26:26] <TwistableGolf> I don't think it's still relevent but wouldn't it be easier to check toggle status by just checking if it has the attribute display:block?
[03:27:02] <TwistableGolf> or actually if it has display:none
[03:27:11] <TwistableGolf> then if it doesn't for when it's shown
[03:28:18] <Uhkis> what do you think .is(':hidden') or is(':visible') do? ;-)
[03:36:01] <sadtaco> Is there a way to get an element under the mouse position?  I'm clicking and dragging and need to see what elements are passed under the cursor with the drag
[03:42:50] <resure> Does jQuery encode URL before post request?
[03:53:33] <Cork> resure: no it doesn't have to
[03:53:37] <Cork> the browser does that
[03:54:39] <Cork> `mdn element from point
[03:54:59] <Cork> sadtaco: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/elementFromPoint
[03:55:19] <sadtaco> "This is an experimental technology" :(
[03:56:33] <Cork> well ya, but the only other option is to grab the cordinates of each element in the page and test if it covers the position you are about
[03:57:05] <resure> Cork: thanks
[03:57:05] <Cork> sadtaco: and also note experimental sure, but supported in all major bowsers
[03:57:08] <Cork> *browsers
[03:57:11] <Cork> including ie 5.5
[03:57:36] <sadtaco> Ah okay heh
[03:57:38] <sadtaco> Sorry
[04:01:30] <Uhkis> Cork: bot's been dead quite a while, probably not coming back at all :(
[04:01:49] <Cork> Uhkis: it was alive yesterday
[04:02:21] <Uhkis> it was? maybe i've been just missing it all the time
[04:04:09] <Cork> Uhkis: [14:23:15] <Cork> .test | [14:23:16] <b-ot> Cork: torst

[04:28:19] <Kartagis> Cork: I'm working on a cordova project
[04:28:26] <Kartagis> what exceptions?
[04:28:53] <Cork> ok, have you actually tested that the code runs at all?
[04:29:44] <Kartagis> yes of course
[04:30:09] <Cork> so you know that the append line runs (on the mobile)
[04:30:20] <Cork> and that the tr actually found the row you want?
[04:36:42] <Kartagis> no no
[04:36:50] <Kartagis> it works on browser
[04:36:56] <Kartagis> not on mobile

[05:21:42] <Industrial> Hi.
[05:22:04] <Industrial> I have a question about DataTables, but can't find any chat room for it. Anyone here have experience with it? (since it's a jquery plugin...)
[05:22:09] <dbugger> Hey guys. If I add "crossDomain: true", to my "$.ajax" request, I shouldnt get this error, right? "XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://xxx.com. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource."
[05:22:19] <dbugger> Because I still get it
[05:24:03] <shoky> dbugger: no, cross-domain requests will only work if the server is explicitly configured to allow it
[05:24:36] <dbugger> Meaning, that xxx.com needs to allow it?
[05:24:39] <shoky> yes
[05:24:48] <dbugger> Mmmm, so I guess that goes my project :P
[05:24:56] <dbugger> *there goes
[05:25:21] <shoky> an alternative is to make a request to your own server, and have the server do the communication with xxx.com
[05:25:45] <dbugger> something like a curl?
[05:26:20] <shoky> mm i donno, depends what server you're working with
[05:26:32] <Bheam> yo
[05:26:34] <shoky> e.g. php, node.js, rails, whatever
[05:26:35] <dbugger> I see
[05:26:45] <Bheam> is there any way to hook into when dom elements are added?
[05:27:21] <Bheam> every time something is added to DOM, i want the handle of the added element(S) so i can process it
[05:27:53] <taplar> possibly a change event on the dom, or an observer
[05:28:00] <taplar> not dom, but body
[05:28:46] <Bheam> ok so there's no global hook called when $.get $.load etc are called?
[05:28:51] <shoky> Bheam there's DOM mutation observers, if you don't care about IE10 and below. but usually there's better ways to do whatever it is you're trying to do
[05:29:04] <shoky> $.get has nothing to do with the DOM
[05:29:10] <Bheam> $.load i mean
[05:29:16] <Bheam> or .append()
[05:29:31] <shoky> as i said, DOM mutation observers
[05:29:43] <Bheam> i care about ie9+
[05:29:56] <shoky> as i said, there's usually better ways to do whatever it is you're trying to do
[05:30:02] <Bheam> fine
[05:30:39] <Bheam> i have a cms, i'm sometimes loading data from server through ajax. some data contains modules that need to be inited (javascript)
[05:31:10] <taplar> so you'd init them in your ajax handler
[05:32:53] <Bheam> the ajax handler has no way of knowing that some generated content needs javascript initing
[05:33:21] <taplar> but you do, logically.  so you'd have to write the logic for it to know too
[05:34:04] <Bheam> i really don't see how it's better to mix javascript and php logic that way
[05:34:33] <Bheam> i'd rather check of every .append() if there's a ".module" inside, and if so $('.module').init();
[05:35:15] <taplar> not sure how your tieing ajax and php together.  ajax can go to any backend language
[05:35:27] <Bheam> not my point
[05:36:31] <Bheam> my point is i don't wanna mix javascript logic into ajax requests themselves. i'd rather have a bundled javascript library that just takes care of everything client side
[05:37:15] <taplar> your ajax is being done by javascript?  append() is an jquery function, which is a javascript library.....
[05:39:45] <taplar> if you don't want to tie them directly together you could always have whatever method that does your ajax, take an optional closure.  then it could be self contained, and if the users want to do something extra when data is appended, they can provide a the closure that is executed and do whatever extra they want
[05:40:21] <Cork> or you could just return the deferred object
[05:40:37] <taplar> ^
[05:40:52] <Cork> i've found my self doing that all the time now days
[05:41:00] <Cork> even if i don't initially plan to do anything
[05:41:14] <Cork> cause it means the code doesn't have to care if something want to know about the response
[05:41:32] <taplar> doesn't hurt to return something that may never be used, :)
[05:41:38] <Cork> yup
[05:42:52] <Cork> (i really think $.Callbacks and deferred is the two best new things added to jquery in a LONG time)
[05:43:18] <taplar> that's a new one on me
[05:43:32] <Cork> $.Callbacks?
[05:43:59] <Cork> it's a simpler form of deferred http://api.jquery.com/jquery.Callbacks/
[05:44:07] <shoky> i'm impressed they're getting 3.0 to be promises/a+ compliant, i thought it'd take much longer, or never happen
[05:44:24] <taplar> yeah, looking at it now.  so is it kinda like defining your own custom on('myspecialeven') ?
[05:44:34] <Cork> no
[05:44:49] <Cork> taplar: it is the same as $.Defarred except it dosn't have reject
[05:45:33] <taplar> i'll have to read up on that more later
[05:46:24] <Cork> function myFunc() { var c = $.Callbacks(); ... c.fire(data); ... return { done: c.add }; }); myFunc().done(function() { /* do something when it is done */ })
[05:47:10] <taplar> so if you add multiple handlers, and fire a value, it invokes the complete chain?
[05:47:19] <Cork> yes
[05:47:21] <taplar> nice!
[05:47:25] <Cork> in the fifo order
[05:47:41] <Cork> yes it is nice
[05:48:17] <Cork> was really nice to stop using the function(p1,p2,p3,callback1, callback2...) one had to do before
[05:49:14] <taplar> so logically you could have var registerUser = $.Callbacks() and chain your various process steps together
[05:49:40] <Cork> well you might want to use deferred there
[05:49:45] <Cork> cause then you could use then
[05:49:55] <Cork> and actually modify what the returned value was
[05:50:04] <taplar> yeah, but i was meaning more to say it can represent a workflow
[05:51:12] <taplar> can a step in the chain terminate the chain prematurely?
[05:52:17] <Cork> spontaneously i would say no
[05:52:23] <Cork> but i will actually look right now
[05:52:26] <shoky> it can
[05:52:44] <shoky> there's a bunch of flags you can set for different behaviours
[05:52:51] <taplar> i guess that would be stopOnFalse
[05:52:54] <shoky> aye
[05:53:09] <Cork> ya
[05:53:13] <Cork> just found that :)
[05:53:19] <Cork> if ( list[ firingIndex ].apply( data[ 0 ], data[ 1 ] ) === false && options.stopOnFalse )
[05:56:17] <samssh> What is the preferred way to check if a any checkbox is checked in a group of checkboxen?
[05:56:45] <taplar> you can do .is(':checked') off of a single element
[05:56:51] <Cork> $('#group :checkbox:checked').length > 0
[05:57:16] <shoky> .is works for multiple elements too btw
[05:57:28] <taplar> yeah, i just misread his question
[05:57:39] <Cork> ya, but you would have to run multiple querySelectorAll to perform it with .is
[05:58:44] <samssh> Cork, the jquery doc pages seems to be saying that $('#group [type="checkbox"]:checked').length > 0 would be better
[05:59:01] <Cork> samssh: eh yes and no
[05:59:11] <Cork> input[type="checkbox"] is better
[05:59:16] <Cork> [type] isn't
[05:59:20] <samssh> Er, yeah
[05:59:27] <Cork> but that is basically what :checkbox does
[05:59:35] <Cork> so it is just a tiny bit faster
[06:00:35] <samssh> Ok, so "input[type=\"checkbox\"]:checked" it is. (I'm doing a .find() from the containing element).
[06:01:05] <Cork> or 'input[type="checkbox"]:checked
[06:01:08] <Cork> :)
[06:01:34] <Cork> personally i use ' for js and " for html attributes
[06:01:36] <samssh> Yeah, which is what I would if the rest of the file agreed.
[06:01:38] <Cork> makes things clean
[06:01:42] <taplar> would it be better to find input first and then filter on the type?
[06:02:01] <Cork> ya, but we are starting to split ms now
[06:02:06] <Cork> it really doesn't matter much
[06:02:25] <Cork> especially if you already run it on a restrictive element group
[06:02:58] <Cork> and if performance is that important you should set a classname on the parent element instead
[06:03:09] <Cork> so you don't have to do the domtraversal
[06:03:09] <taplar> :)
[06:04:37] <samssh> Mmmm, FF 40 is out.
[06:04:55] <Kartagis> I'm in the process of creating a cordova application, and I've got something like http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/db7Logua/. now. I can use $(".title").val() for the first input field. what do I need to use if I add another row to the table?
[06:04:55] <taplar> did they celebrate with a 40?
[06:05:40] <taplar> Kartagis: so your wanting to target a specific title if there are many?
[06:06:04] <Kartagis> taplar: actually, I want to target all of them
[06:06:05] <samssh> Thanks for the helps peeps!
[06:07:16] <Cork> samssh: use serializeArray
[06:07:22] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[06:07:28] <Cork> Kartagis: use serializeArray
[06:07:56] <Cork> just make sure to give the input field a good name attribute
[06:07:57] <samssh> Heh, oddly, that is a potential solution to my task, though probably not the fastest ever.
[06:08:48] <Cork> samssh: ya, if you want to catch a form or a set of form fields that is a good solution
[06:09:06] <Cork> though if you just want to use it for js testing it might not be the best option
[06:09:20] <Kartagis> Cork: the ajax request looks like data:'node[field_videolar][und][0][value]=' + encodeURIComponent($(".title").val()),. could you fiddle using this? pretty please?
[06:10:14] <Cork> uh... don't build params encoding by hand >_<'
[06:10:25] <Cork> there is built in ways to handle it in jquery
[06:11:04] <Cork> Kartagis: so $.ajax(url, { data: $('.title').serialize() })
[06:11:13] <Cork> just fix the name attribute on the input fields
[06:14:28] <Kartagis> Cork: how do I tell it to go into what field? there are many fields
[06:14:41] <Cork> Kartagis: it grabs all of them
[06:15:00] <Cork> you just have to make sure they have valid names (like i've told you thrice now)
[06:15:32] <Kartagis> Cork: I'm assuming field_name is tag name?
[06:15:48] <Cork> what?
[06:16:18] <Cork> <input name="node[field_videolar][und][0][value]" value="something">

[07:20:15] <django_> ?
[07:20:30] <Cork> if you want to find the img tag inside the named id, then yes
[07:21:47] <django_> cool ty
[07:24:19] <HADRI1> Hello guys! I would like to know if you can move one picture from a folder to another using jquery
[07:26:06] <Cork> HADRI1: folder, like on the servers file system?
[07:26:54] <HADRI1> Nop, just on my computer
[07:27:05] <Cork> then no you can't
[07:27:20] <HADRI1> MMh that's what i thought
[07:27:22] <Cork> web content js can't access the clients filesystem at all
[07:27:50] <Cork> also note jquery is just a framework it can't do anything js can't
[07:27:59] <django_> when you use: .css("background-color","white");
[07:28:04] <Cork> and js can't do anything the browser doesn't expose an api to do
[07:28:06] <django_> how can i add more
[07:28:10] <Cork> more?
[07:28:31] <Cork> firstly you should consider writing the css in your stylesheet instead
[07:28:39] <Cork> and using classes to change the stype
[07:29:07] <Cork> if you have to do it more dynamically then css can for some reason you can use an object
[07:29:25] <django_> Cork: its for an event
[07:29:26] <Cork> .css({ "key1": "value", "key2": "value" })
[07:29:38] <Cork> django_: doesn't mean it can't be a class in the stylesheat
[07:29:40] <Cork> *sheet
[07:29:48] <HADRI1> Cork : I see (and don't worry I know about the bigger power of JS than jquery) thanks for help ! Have a nice day
[07:29:51] <Cork> just use .toggleClass/addClass/removeClass
[07:32:05] <isthisreallife> http://pastie.org/10361535  how to change text with fadeIn/fadeOut in this case? thank you
[07:36:12] <isthisreallife> :>
[08:01:16] <mentoc> How would I select an <option> using jquery? I was thinking of doing something like $("#mySelect option").each() and comparing the .val() to see if it equals my desired one but there's gotta be a better way!
[08:02:16] <shoky> mentoc: the <select>'s value is the selected option's value. so you can just do $('#mySelect').val()
[08:02:48] <mentoc> shoky: is it case sensitive?
[08:03:05] <shoky> umm, is what case sensitive?
[08:03:40] <mentoc> nevermind, I think I got it with your advice :)
[08:08:17] <xsaxw> hello, you know how I can display this table ? http://codeshare.io/9ahgb
[08:09:20] <persina> How do i add the same tooltip to multiple elements?
[08:09:46] <persina> using jquery-ui
[08:22:21] <xsaxw> hello, you know how I can display this table ? http://codeshare.io/9ahgb
[08:40:57] <dude999> hello
[08:41:09] <dude999> what time is it now
[08:41:09] <xsaxw> hello, you know how I can display this table ? http://codeshare.io/9ahgb
[08:41:22] <robertmaxrees> dude999 for me?  8:41am PST
[08:41:50] <robertmaxrees> xsaxw not sure i follow. .  that code doesn’t really make sense.
[08:42:33] <dude999> for me 10:41 GMT +7
[08:42:52] <robertmaxrees> dude999 okay?
[08:43:06] <dude999> okay lol
[08:43:08] <Uhkis> 18:43
[08:44:00] <dude999> xsaxw: what is it that u share here?
[08:45:47] <Shadow> Hi, how can I get this to work that only one is open at a time. https://jsfiddle.net/h47s4nsy/
[08:48:05] <xsaxw> I'd like to see what is in the table in an html list
[08:48:31] <robertmaxrees> xsaxw that doesn’t really make much sense. make a fiddle of what you have so far.
[08:48:42] <robertmaxrees> Shadow don’t use .toggleClass(), but it’ll look something like https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/h47s4nsy/2/
[08:49:07] <robertmaxrees> also, var container = $(this).parent().parent().parent(); - you can use .closest() to get the parent element that you want instead.
[08:50:24] <subsonic> To answer my own question about infinite scrolling.  I just implemented it myself, so simple to know when the scoll hits the bottom
[08:50:42] <mentoc> Is there a better way to check an <option>? $("#tour_state option[value='" + data['state'] + "']").attr("selected","selected");
[08:51:02] <robertmaxrees> use .prop(‘selected’, true), but the same basic idea, mentoc
[08:51:27] <mentoc> is prop very backwards compatible?
[08:51:29] <Shadow> robertmaxrees: I tried that link but the toggling seems to be messed up
[08:51:37] <robertmaxrees> mentoc yep.
[08:51:46] <mentoc> sahweeeeet
[08:51:48] <robertmaxrees> Shadow right - don’t use the toggle methods.
[09:17:22] <notchris> Is there an easier way to do the following: http://pastebin.com/R1vUEu44
[09:17:23] <notchris> ?
[09:21:57] <subsonic> notchris: You could make the duplicate code in a function, then just call the funciton twice
[09:22:17] <notchris> True
[09:48:30] <ezek2k4> hi
[09:53:05] <taplar> aloha
[09:54:01] <robertmaxrees> yo
[09:56:54] <onr> hiya
[09:57:04] <taplar> bonjour
[09:57:39] <gnarf> mentoc: $("#tour_state").val(data['state']) ?
[10:01:26] <taplar> ugly brackets.  ugly!
[10:04:01] <ezek2k4> hmm is it normal that autocomplete dont works on fiddle?
[10:04:04] <ezek2k4> https://fiddle.jshell.net/pfL2fyjz/
[10:04:56] <AliG1000> I have an input form.  I would like to restrict it to any number except 0.  e.g. 1, 2, 3 etc. 10, 100, 1000 etc are all OK
[10:05:44] <taplar> +$(field).val() > 0 :D
[10:05:51] <robertmaxrees> ew
[10:05:56] <taplar> not safe if they type in chars though
[10:05:58] <taplar> lol
[10:06:03] <taplar> regex could work for you
[10:06:17] <robertmaxrees> parseFloat or parseInt, depending
[10:06:17] <Uhkis> thats what parseInt is for!
[10:06:22] <taplar> ^[^0][0-9]*
[10:06:38] <taplar> ^[^0][0-9]*$
[10:06:57] <robertmaxrees> but seriously.
[10:07:02] <robertmaxrees> use parseInt or parseFloat.
[10:07:37] <AliG1000> I'll look at parseInt and then regex.  Thank you
[10:07:55] <taplar> shunned by my piers.  forever alone in life...
[10:08:31] <Uhkis> piers :-D
[10:08:45] <robertmaxrees> lols
[10:08:47] <taplar> lol
[10:09:12] <Kartagis> why am I getting Unexpected token : here? http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/huecs1vr/
[10:10:14] <AliG1000> parseInt only processes a number e.g. 10.00 into 10  how cn I use that?
[10:10:14] <robertmaxrees> your success and error calls need to be passed to the ajax call.
[10:10:23] <robertmaxrees> AliG1000 parsefloat
[10:10:30] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis use .done() and .fail()
[10:10:50] <ezek2k4> cant make autocomplete works on fiddle :( https://fiddle.jshell.net/8msjpf1L/3/ but my question is how i make this works... Let say im selecting a country from origin it will just alert the part that i was writing and not the selectiong itself
[10:11:43] <ezek2k4> ex if i was writing "United" and the autcomplete show United States i select it and i get United on the alert instead of the whole selection
[10:11:43] <AliG1000> even parseFloat just turns 0 into 0.  I want to exclude 0 :)
[10:11:53] <robertmaxrees> AliG1000 make a fiddle.
[10:12:22] <mentoc> gnarf: would that work just as good as setting the attribute with prop?
[10:12:31] <ezek2k4> any idea how I can achieve that?
[10:12:47] <gnarf> mentoc: better, because if your value contains a ' in your "selector" pattern - it will be an invalid selector
[10:14:15] <taplar> ezek2k4: https://fiddle.jshell.net/pfL2fyjz/1/
[10:14:26] <taplar> for some reason the include of the ui didn't seem to work.  manually added it
[10:14:41] <ezek2k4> i see
[10:15:14] <mentoc> gnarf: I didn't even think of that! That's like an sql injection
[10:19:08] <AliG1000> OK - http://jsfiddle.net/57cdnb8q/1/  I have limited the input to just numbers
[10:19:35] <robertmaxrees> O.o

[10:21:35] <ThePendulum> Hey. Has anyone worked with DataTables before? I'm not sure how row.add is supposed to work. I am feeding it an object with data, but the table remains empty. Can it actually add new rows to the DOM? And if not, what does table.row.add and table.draw do?
[10:22:56] <taplar> robertmaxrees: what about (isNaN(this.value) || parseFloat(this.value) > 0)
[10:23:11] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/isNaN
[10:23:15] <taplar> err < 1
[10:23:16] <robertmaxrees> you rarely want isNaN
[10:23:33] <robertmaxrees> isNaN is for testing if a value is NaN - not a string or number.
[10:24:12] <robertmaxrees> this satisfies exactly what he wants :)
[10:24:27] <taplar> ah, cause truthy
[10:24:59] <robertmaxrees> actually, http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/57cdnb8q/3/
[10:24:59] <ThePendulum> >> isNaN
[10:25:10] <ThePendulum> surely you guys have a JS bot in here
[10:25:13] <robertmaxrees> isNaN is just to test if a value is NaN, not if it isn’t a number.
[10:25:25] <robertmaxrees> there was a bot for a while.
[10:25:31] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery
[10:25:31] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: jQuery → https://jquery.com/
[10:25:42] <ThePendulum> But one that sandboxes javascript?
[10:25:45] <taplar> hmm, i've misunderstood that function for a long time it seems
[10:25:57] <robertmaxrees> NaN can be a confusing concept..
[10:27:36] <AliG1000> it does work.  I updated the last fiddle from 'change' to 'input' which appears to work as intended
[10:27:41] <AliG1000> http://jsfiddle.net/57cdnb8q/5/
[10:27:53] <robertmaxrees> that’s another way to do it.
[10:28:23] <robertmaxrees> taplar http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k27f8qLe/
[10:29:23] <taplar> yeah, i just didn't get that it wasn't doing an evaluation. i thought it was actually checking to see if the string contained non numeric characters
[10:29:42] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it’s actually checking if the value is NaN
[10:30:02] <taplar> which apparently is not a concrete object, due to the === failing
[10:30:07] <robertmaxrees> actually it is.
[10:30:11] <robertmaxrees> but it’s not equal to itself.
[10:30:15] <taplar> lol
[10:30:17] <robertmaxrees> it’s a number.
[10:30:37] <taplar> so internally is the nan part like a flag?
[10:30:48] <robertmaxrees> internally it’s a number that’s “Not a Number”
[10:30:57] <robertmaxrees> isNaN() checks to see if a number is NaN
[10:31:29] <robertmaxrees> it’s a value, just like 1 or 19284, it just has the extra rule that’s it’s not equal to anything.
[10:31:40] <taplar> oh, ok.  so like \n is 13 and would also be NaN
[10:31:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:31:53] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees you causin trouble
[10:32:00] <taplar> the char code
[10:32:01] <robertmaxrees> “\n is 13”?
[10:32:06] <robertmaxrees> no.
[10:32:08] <acidjazz> 13 is enter
[10:32:09] <robertmaxrees> \n is not NaN
[10:32:33] <robertmaxrees> NaN is a number - \n is a string :)
[10:32:33] <acidjazz> taplar: this will explain everythign https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat
[10:32:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:32:52] <taplar> \n is a character, technically
[10:33:06] <robertmaxrees> which in js is of type “String”
[10:33:19] <taplar> ah, true
[10:33:30] <robertmaxrees> NaN is a number - \n isn’t “NaN”, “NaN” is an actual, distinct value.
[10:34:01] <taplar> acidjazz: seen that before
[10:34:24] <taplar> or atleast i believe i have, it's failing to load
[10:35:22] <Guddu> G'day All

[10:35:36] <pecey> hello people. I am using vex for modals for my next project. http://github.hubspot.com/vex/api/advanced/. In the code, they have something like  "afterClose: -> console.log 'vexClose'". Can someone please explain what -> symbol means in this context? Never used it before in JS or jQuery
[10:35:51] <acidjazz> pecey: http://momentjs.com/
[10:35:54] <ezek2k4> in an autocomplete what would be the event after select?
[10:36:06] <acidjazz> pecey: you can probably do it w/out moment, but either way it just makes life easier
[10:36:33] <pecey> acidjazz, sorry didnt get you.
[10:36:34] <robertmaxrees> pecey that’s coffeescript.
[10:36:36] <Synthead> is there a way I can run a function when an element gets created?
[10:36:42] <robertmaxrees> click the “js” option in the upper right.
[10:36:48] <acidjazz> pecey: [17:35] < acidjazz> pecey: http://momentjs.com/
[10:36:52] <robertmaxrees> Synthead sort of, but it’s a really bad idea.
[10:37:01] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: why?
[10:37:07] <pecey> robertmaxrees, sorry my bad.
[10:37:09] <robertmaxrees> Synthead it’s slow and code smell.
[10:37:10] <pecey> thanks a ton :)
[10:37:13] <robertmaxrees> pecey sure :D
[10:37:13] <acidjazz> woops that was menat for guddu
[10:37:16] <acidjazz> Guddu: [17:35] < acidjazz> pecey: http://momentjs.com/
[10:37:27] <robertmaxrees> Synthead it’s confusing as all hell, too.
[10:39:08] <Guddu> acidjazz, Thanks but I cannot really use another library. I have to do this using JQuery Datepicker only. Can it be done?
[10:39:09] <Guddu> Please help.
[10:39:40] <acidjazz> Guddu: you mean jqueryui datepicker?
[10:39:49] <Guddu> acidjazz, Yes.
[10:40:00] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: admittedly, this is more of an x-y question... here's what I'm really trying to do: I am using jquery ui menus, and on (sub)menus with a lot of items, they overflow off the page.  I want to make this a scroll-able list instead.  Since the user can open a context menu from various parts of the page, I can't give it a static max-height CSS value.  At the moment, I'm doing a little .outerHeight() and $(window).height() math to set a max-heig
[10:40:00] <Synthead> ht via JS, but it's dirty :p
[10:40:07] <acidjazz> Guddu: well you have your Date() object right?
[10:40:15] <robertmaxrees> Synthead that cut off.
[10:40:20] <acidjazz> Guddu: so say i wanted to add one day
[10:40:26] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: you don't see two messages?
[10:40:29] <robertmaxrees> Synthead try and boil your problem down into one statement :)
[10:40:32] <Guddu> acidjazz, Yes....in selectedDate
[10:40:38] <Synthead> <Synthead> ht via JS, but it's dirty :p
[10:40:45] <acidjazz> Guddu: var today = new Date(); var tmrw = new date(today); tmrw.setDate(today.getDate()+1);
[10:40:56] <robertmaxrees> Synthead i’m lazy :) do you have a fiddle or something?
[10:41:15] <acidjazz> Guddu: so just replae the 1 w/ a 7 and you have a date object 7 days in the future
[10:41:21] <robertmaxrees> Synthead and why are the menus so long?  that’s really wacky UI.
[10:41:24] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: heh :) I want jquery ui menus to overflow with a scrollbar when they're too large for the page
[10:41:39] <Guddu> acidjazz, Please look at my code at http://dpaste.com/19Q87NR
[10:41:48] <Guddu> $( "#date_to" ).datepicker( "option", "maxDate", selectedDate+7); did not work for me
[10:41:58] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: the menus are built from dynamic content.  only a few menus are really long
[10:42:06] <Synthead> (at the moment at least)
[10:42:18] <robertmaxrees> Synthead yeah, you need to come up with something different then.
[10:42:27] <robertmaxrees> a filter input might be nice.
[10:43:14] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: different how?  I was hoping to do something like $(window).delegate(".ui-menu", <some event>, function(event) { add scrollbar if too tall; })
[10:43:49] <robertmaxrees> Synthead 2 things: 1 - this is why a fiddle would be really nice. 2 - .delegate is deprecated.  use .on() instead :)
[10:44:06] <taplar> Guddu: selectedDate is a Date object?
[10:44:07] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: I'll work on a fiddle :)
[10:44:41] <taplar> or a string?
[10:45:15] <Guddu> taplar, Is there a way to check that? using type()?
[10:45:24] <taplar> console log it
[10:46:14] <Guddu> taplar, Its a string then as it seems
[10:46:44] <taplar> then, been a while since i messed with datepicker, but i think your maxDate would stay just +7d
[10:47:26] <taplar> or be changed to '+7d' since it's starting as 0d
[10:47:48] <taplar> though that seems weird
[10:47:55] <taplar> your restricting them to the current day?
[10:48:40] <Guddu> taplar, Restricting them to a7 day Window. So if from_date was X . . . to_date cannot be more than X+7
[10:49:16] <taplar> yeah, so try chaning your date_to to start out with a maxDate of '+7d' and don't worry about changing that
[10:49:20] <taplar> *changing
[10:49:32] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: am I doing this right?  my menu looks malformed in jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/can40wjy/
[10:49:45] <Synthead> OH
[10:49:47] <Synthead> jeez
[10:49:48] <Synthead> sorry
[10:50:52] <Synthead> it still looks hokey :/ http://jsfiddle.net/can40wjy/1/
[10:51:08] <Guddu> taplar, So if date_from is 10/16/1980. . . date_to cannot be more than 10/23/1980
[10:52:19] <Guddu> taplar, I tried this but even this does not work :-(
[10:52:19] <Guddu> $( "#date_to" ).datepicker( "option", "maxDate", $("#date_from").datepicker("getDate")+7);
[10:52:27] <taplar> playing with it now.  the question is if the maxDate is calculated off the minDate or current date
[10:53:00] <Guddu> taplar, maxdate on to_date is calculated based on whatever is the current selection on from_date
[10:53:31] <taplar> no, i'm talking about how datepicker calculates it
[10:53:55] <taplar> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-maxDate
[10:54:08] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: am I doing this right?  I copied the jquery ui example from their website to jsfiddle and it's even malformed
[10:54:31] <taplar> looks like it goes off of current date
[10:54:55] <taplar> k, so it looks like you'll have to take your string and convert it into a Date object and add seven days to that, for the maxDate to use
[10:55:27] <Guddu> taplar this code returns date objects
[10:55:31] <Guddu> $( "#date_to" ).datepicker( "option", "maxDate", $("#date_from").datepicker("getDate")+7);
[10:55:56] <taplar> $("#date_from").datepicker("getDate") returns a date?
[10:56:40] <Guddu> taplar, Yes
[10:56:56] <Guddu> taplar, It got logged as Tue Aug 11 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Pacific SA Standard Time)
[10:56:57] <taplar> console log the +7 and see what you get
[10:58:33] <Guddu> taplar, Mon Aug 03 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Pacific SA Standard Time)7d
[10:58:37] <taplar> :)
[10:59:19] <Guddu> taplar, But how do i add days then?
[10:59:35] <taplar> try dateObj.setDate(dateObj.getDate() +7)
[11:05:25] <Guddu> taplar, Not working :-(
[11:06:51] <Guddu> taplar, Actually this code works. Could you please help in reviewing it?
[11:07:09] <taplar> got it working?  something is still wrong in mine...

[11:08:59] <Parsec300> Hi everyone, if I use .on() with a map and control event bubbling? I need the event to bubble, not capturing
[11:09:39] <duch_kazatel> Parsec300 wut
[11:10:24] <Parsec300> robertmaxrees, well. I'm using .on() to specify more than one event handler to one element
[11:10:39] <robertmaxrees> following
[11:11:03] <Parsec300> That works great, but I can't find in the documentation how to control event bubbling or capturing in this instance. I've found how to do it seperately.
[11:11:57] <robertmaxrees> Parsec300 how and why are you trying to control “bubbling or capturing”
[11:12:40] <Parsec300> Because what I'm trying to achieve works great in Safari, but not in Firefox. I think it's due to the different default behavior in these browsers
[11:13:41] <robertmaxrees> wha are you trying to achieve?
[11:13:45] <robertmaxrees> you’re being kind of vague.
[11:14:49] <Parsec300> I have this input element inside another element. Both elements have a onchange event handler. One browser executes the inside element's event first, the other executes the parent's event first
[11:14:49] <__zug__> Beginner here...I wonder why my jQuery isn't running? http://jsfiddle.net/eybn5e07/
[11:15:19] <robertmaxrees> Parsec300 you want to stopPropagation() on the child element.
[11:15:27] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[11:15:49] <taplar> doesn't look like you have it include on the LHS.  also for a fiddle don't put your whole page, just the body, script and css.  external resources can be linked to
[11:16:11] <robertmaxrees> __zug__ it IS running.
[11:16:21] <robertmaxrees> you’re just not seeing the animation.
[11:16:27] <__zug__> I wonder why?
[11:16:31] <__zug__> and ty
[11:16:37] <robertmaxrees> because adding those classes doesn’t animate things.
[11:16:51] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[11:16:54] <robertmaxrees> check this out.
[11:16:55] <tgodar> can someone explain why this only works in Chrome?  submit() with in modal jQuery UI Dialog... http://jsfiddle.net/92tsdur5/9/
[11:16:58] <Parsec300> __zug__, I think first of all you need to move the code into the javascript window and the css into the css window
[11:17:07] <robertmaxrees> Parsec300 the code’s running ;)
[11:17:15] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, that’s not how you use jsfiddle.
[11:17:15] <Parsec300> Oh
[11:18:50] <Parsec300> robertmaxrees, basically I have event handlers assigned in this way: http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/tryit.asp?filename=tryjquery_event_on_map
[11:18:58] <robertmaxrees> w3schools :(
[11:19:07] <robertmaxrees> and i told you what you need to do.
[11:19:20] <robertmaxrees> stopPropagation() on the event handler for the child element.
[11:19:20] <Parsec300> But can't find how to allow or prevent bubbling writing it like that
[11:19:29] <robertmaxrees> you don’t explicitly “allow”, only prevent.
[11:19:37] <Parsec300> Ok
[11:19:41] <Parsec300> I'll try it
[11:19:43] <robertmaxrees> let me show you.
[11:24:19] <robertmaxrees> Parsec300
[11:24:20] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/16rg80kv/
[11:25:07] <tgodar> ok... so do some browsers just not allow creating a JS form and submitting it?  How can that be?
[11:25:16] <robertmaxrees> sure they do.
[11:25:23] <robertmaxrees> you’re probably binding to something before it exists.
[11:25:25] <tgodar> ..creating programmatically that is
[11:25:27] <robertmaxrees> try using delegating.
[11:25:30] <robertmaxrees> *delegation
[11:26:27] <tgodar> ah, misread this post.. must be part of the DOM... well duh
[11:26:39] <robertmaxrees> delegation?  sorta yeah.
[11:26:45] <tgodar> robertmaxrees: anything jump out there? http://jsfiddle.net/92tsdur5/9/
[11:26:52] <Parsec300> robertmaxrees, that did the trick. Thanks!
[11:27:13] <robertmaxrees> where’s the binding, tgodar?
[11:27:25] <robertmaxrees> ah, tform.submit();
[11:27:39] <tgodar> yeah, weird thing is works fine in Chrome
[11:28:24] <tgodar> Could work around it but now I want to know what the issue is
[11:28:44] <robertmaxrees> where are you putting the form?
[11:29:33] <robertmaxrees> because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/92tsdur5/10/
[11:29:35] <tgodar> hmm, does the document.createElement not actually append it to the dom?
[11:29:46] <robertmaxrees> you’re convoluting it :)
[11:29:53] <robertmaxrees> it’s created in the DOM, but it’s not apart of the page technically.
[11:30:30] <tgodar> ahh, sure enough.  In my head was certain I was starting with the form attached, then appending the input to it etc
[11:30:31] <tgodar> thanks!
[11:30:59] <tgodar> and as SO was telling me.. FF doesn't like if not on the DOM when submitting.
[11:31:10] <robertmaxrees> it’s in the DOM.
[11:31:14] <robertmaxrees> but it’s not on the page.
[11:31:46] <tgodar> thanks for making distinction.
[11:32:41] <tgodar> damn cross browser compatibility..  maybe what I hate most about front-end development
[11:33:08] <robertmaxrees> it’s not as bad these days.
[11:33:43] <robertmaxrees> and this isn’t really a compatibility thing - it’s really strange to create a form and not append it to the page.
[11:34:26] <tgodar> well its just a transport... weird that it did work in Chrome
[11:35:27] <robertmaxrees> chrome is actually far less compliant than you’d think.
[11:35:33] <robertmaxrees> blink and webkit are pretty bad these days.
[11:37:07] <tgodar> not sure what the "standard" would be on this, where it the harm in submitting without appending to the body... anyway dont want to beat a dead horse.  Just honestly curious
[11:37:43] <robertmaxrees> it’s not about harm, it’s about consistency
[11:38:08] <tgodar> you can call other methods on an object prior to adding it to the "page"
[11:38:28] <robertmaxrees> some, sure.  submitting a form not in the page doesn’t really make sense :)
[11:38:33] <robertmaxrees> some methods would make sense.
[11:49:07] <arc_> so if you're trying to bind an event to a button, and most of the button is taken up by an icon that would normally be where you click, but if you happen to click on the edge, that's the parent element of the icon
[11:49:15] <arc_> i'm not really sure what the best thing to do there is
[11:49:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:49:29] <robertmaxrees> and you bind listeners, not events :)
[11:49:38] <arc_> ya ya :p
[11:49:54] <robertmaxrees> and you bind to the button.
[11:50:07] <robertmaxrees> also, be careful with what you’re adding as children to the button.
[11:50:11] <robertmaxrees> you can only add specific content.
[11:50:19] <arc_> i tried that initially but when i clicked on the icon it wasn't firing the event
[11:50:38] <robertmaxrees> what kind of element is the icon?
[11:50:38] <arc_> unfortunately i don't have control over the html, it's for a userscript
[11:50:47] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle then :)
[11:50:57] <arc_> a span
[11:51:07] <arc_> span with :before
[11:51:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah, a fiddle would be really helpful here.
[11:51:22] <robertmaxrees> because that should work just fine.
[11:51:34] <arc_> i'll see what i can do
[11:57:10] <robertmaxrees> arc_ http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4fthx66s/
[11:59:21] <arc_> hmm, strange
[12:00:07] <arc_> could the bindings that already exist on the site be interfering with it somehow
[12:00:25] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:00:27] <arc_> btw i tried to make a fiddle but i can't replicate the element exactly because i can't figure out how to make jsfiddle embed web fonts :p
[12:00:43] <robertmaxrees> the left-hand side under “external resources”
[12:00:51] <arc_> tried that, it didn't work
[12:01:01] <arc_> oh wait i missed something
[12:02:15] <arc_> ugh, doesn't matter anyway. i'm sure the problem won't manifest here
[12:15:25] <jak2000> why not sumarize(total) the 8th column? https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/wds1t37y/ any help? plz
[12:16:03] <robertmaxrees> .val() is for inputs.
[12:16:35] <robertmaxrees> also: you’re usingthe wrong each there.
[12:17:10] <robertmaxrees> also also: you could .map() that and then reduce it all, instead.
[12:25:44] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wds1t37y/3/
[12:27:25] <jak2000> ok robertmaxrees thanks

[12:30:47] <jak2000> and the comma?
[12:31:18] <robertmaxrees> regex

[12:32:34] <robertmaxrees> ThePendulum you’ll have a lot more luck in their forums
[12:32:52] <ThePendulum> Forums still exist?

[12:33:08] <robertmaxrees> ThePendulum https://www.datatables.net/forums/
[12:33:22] <robertmaxrees> i suggested they make an IRC channel and let some community members run it but they didn’t like that idea.

[12:45:14] <neophitosore> someone to help me guys ? :)
[12:45:28] <ThePendulum> just ask!
[12:45:33] <neophitosore> i did :)

[12:45:52] <ThePendulum> Oh, I see now :P my bad
[12:45:57] <ThePendulum> I should apply to become a referee
[12:45:59] <neophitosore> no no no pb :)
[12:46:16] <neophitosore> that s already so cool to help people
[12:46:18] <ThePendulum> http://pastie.org/10362239
[12:46:22] <ThePendulum> repasted that with highlighting
[12:46:23] <ThePendulum> let me seee
[12:46:51] <ThePendulum> neophitosore: there is quite a lot going on in that paste, what exactly do you not understand?
[12:46:56] <ThePendulum> oh
[12:47:00] <ThePendulum> I am blind again, you wrote it at the top
[12:47:09] <neophitosore> i made a jsfiddle i think it s more easy to understand https://jsfiddle.net/hm3z7z2f/
[12:47:33] <neophitosore> my pb is pretty strange i think
[12:47:57] <neophitosore> the objectiv is when u click on next prev buttons that make appears next or prev content
[12:48:00] <neophitosore> easy that way
[12:48:06] <ThePendulum> neophitosore: do you think you could isolate the relevant bits of code?
[12:48:09] <neophitosore> but when you click prev all works
[12:48:21] <ThePendulum> thus make a fiddle with just the broken construction
[12:48:23] <neophitosore> and the next doesn t
[12:48:38] <neophitosore> you want more light code ?
[12:48:45] <neophitosore> because the problem is in the Js
[12:49:08] <ThePendulum> well you practically fiddled the entire page
[12:49:13] <ThePendulum> it makes it harder for us to see what you mean
[12:49:17] <ThePendulum> and to show you how to fix it
[12:49:19] <neophitosore> i see :)
[12:49:24] <neophitosore> let me do that for u
[12:49:40] <ThePendulum> often if you recreate the problem you find the solution yourself, too
[12:50:20] <ThePendulum> also, as a sidenote, 'vw' is a fun unit but please don't use it like this :P the text is practically unreadable
[12:50:41] <ThePendulum> people with smaller monitors don't necessarily have better eyes!
[12:52:35] <neophitosore> hope it will be better https://jsfiddle.net/hm3z7z2f/1/
[12:53:42] <ThePendulum> could you strip some HTML?
[12:54:25] <neophitosore> no pb
[12:55:47] <neophitosore> https://jsfiddle.net/hm3z7z2f/3/
[12:55:59] <ThePendulum> getting there, let's see
[12:56:16] <ThePendulum> where is this prev/next button
[12:56:51] <neophitosore> .cgu-fleches-droite img
[12:56:53] <ThePendulum> you see this is what I mean with an absolutely minimal fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/ThePendulum/y6ttdre2/ :P
[12:57:05] <ThePendulum> only to-the-point code
[12:57:50] <neophitosore> what da hell oO now the code works
[12:57:57] <neophitosore> as i just remove some html oO
[12:58:27] <ThePendulum> for support it also really helps if you write HTML in English
[12:58:53] <ThePendulum> but let's see
[12:58:58] <ThePendulum> it works now? :p
[13:00:48] <neophitosore> yes but i don t understand why... i just removed the lorem ipsum gfx have put in the html
[13:00:55] <neophitosore> and now everything works
[13:01:01] <neophitosore> i d wanna understand :(
[13:02:53] <jak2000> robertmaxrees can you (please, you know much about jQuery) recommend me a good tutorial of Jquery, the Base of Jquery, not official site, please
[13:03:09] <jak2000> if can
[13:07:58] <robertmaxrees> back
[13:08:07] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 learn.jquery.com is a good tutorial.
[13:08:17] <robertmaxrees> the api docs are another greate resource.
[13:08:19] <robertmaxrees> *great
[13:10:27] <jak2000> ok
[13:10:55] <jak2000> i want learn the base... understanding jQuery ... i win
[13:11:24] <neophitosore> back i reproduced tha bug :) https://jsfiddle.net/hm3z7z2f/4/
[13:11:36] <neophitosore> if the id contains the number 1 it won t works oO
[13:12:18] <robertmaxrees> neophitosore what’s your problem?
[13:12:27] <neophitosore> hi robert
[13:12:50] <neophitosore> it s pretty simple when you clic on next button it works till you do not access id > 9
[13:13:03] <neophitosore> when id contains number 1 it doesn t work anymore
[13:13:25] <neophitosore> i neer have seen that
[13:13:35] <robertmaxrees> the event listener isn’t running at all for what it’s worth.
[13:13:49] <robertmaxrees> oh it’s on the input.
[13:14:13] <neophitosore> i use a marker (input id = idcontent to get the value of the current div i show
[13:14:31] <neophitosore> according to the capter i selected
[13:14:32] <robertmaxrees> what is this trying to do?
[13:15:08] <neophitosore> just making disapearing div content to replace it by the one relative to the id chapter Vs id content
[13:15:22] <neophitosore> you clic chapter 1 => hidding all and showing content 1
[13:15:29] <neophitosore> you clic chapter 2 => content 2
[13:15:30] <robertmaxrees> if( $('#idcontent').val() < $maxcontent ){ - isn’t what you think it is.
[13:16:05] <neophitosore> but when the id of the chapter is sup to 9 or contains 1 (like 10 or 14 or 15...) doesn t work
[13:16:11] <neophitosore> uh ?
[13:16:14] <robertmaxrees>  $('#idcontent').val() is a string.
[13:16:20] <neophitosore> uh !
[13:16:22] <django_> is there a jquery script to run code when viewport size  changs
[13:16:24] <neophitosore> damn right !
[13:16:26] <django_> if(viewport-size-change){}
[13:16:31] <django_> but built into jquery
[13:16:32] <neophitosore> i have to parseInt() it
[13:16:38] <robertmaxrees> django_ not an if - event binding.  window resize.
[13:16:45] <robertmaxrees> django_ be careful with that though.
[13:18:25] <django_> robertmaxrees: whhy is that
[13:18:40] <robertmaxrees> it can run dozens of times.
[13:18:46] <robertmaxrees> in rapid succession.
[13:18:55] <django_> yeah thats the only way to do it
[13:19:07] <robertmaxrees> don’t run $() and stuff in the handler.
[13:19:09] <robertmaxrees> do it before.
[13:28:45] <django_> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/A5zh3bcv
[13:29:11] <neophitosore> Thank you robert it s working ! :)
[13:30:27] <robertmaxrees> django_ right - be careful what goes in there.
[13:34:23] <django_> robertmaxrees: its not working though
[13:34:31] <django_> i need it to change the width of something and it doesnt
[13:34:39] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle ;)
[13:51:19] <Shadow> How do I toggle the arrow to change when clicked open. http://jsfiddle.net/mdKU4/72/
[13:52:20] <robertmaxrees> use a class.
[13:53:28] <Shadow> robertmaxrees: there is a class on each image
[13:54:06] <robertmaxrees> right - toggle classes to make it open/closed.
[13:54:26] <Shadow> how?
[13:54:36] <subsonic> Shadow: Kind of off topic, but have you looked into fontawesome?
[13:54:42] <robertmaxrees> Shadow toggleClass()
[13:55:19] <Shadow> subsonic: hi, no I haven't. Would that be easier
[13:55:32] <robertmaxrees> you could swap classes there.
[13:56:09] <subsonic> expanding robertmaxrees's suggestion: I believe he means move the images into a class: .arrow-right { display: block; background-image: arrow-right.png; background-repeat: none; }
[13:56:37] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[13:56:56] <subsonic> But in regards to font awesome, you'd just need to include it and toggleClass("fa-arrow-right", "fa-arrow-down") or however the names and function works
[13:58:17] <Shadow> ok, thank you.
[14:00:53] * hlvwrk slaps robertmaxrees on the back
[14:00:57] <hlvwrk> HEY. YOU.
[14:01:03] <hlvwrk> "_"
[14:02:57] <nodist> Shadow an example http://jsfiddle.net/mdKU4/73/
[14:05:07] <subsonic> nodist: Nice.   But his HTML is going to look messy. :)   Reminds me of my early days
[14:05:48] <nodist> Quickest way I could think of
[14:06:24] <subsonic> I would agree based on the his fiddle. :)
[14:43:12] <larsi> why does it seem so hard to accomplish this..
[14:43:24] <larsi> how do I allow text selection in a disabled input?
[15:04:56] <subsonic> does it have to be disabled?  What about readonly?
[15:24:47] <Kirito> Is there a jQuery selector for "eq(2) if it exists, else eq(1) / first"?
[15:25:20] <Kirito> or 0 / 1 I guess
[15:25:49] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:28:24] <Kirito> Actually never mind, I found a better way to do it
[15:50:38] <acidjazz> no Kirito you cant really put booleans in jquery selectors
[15:52:02] <onr> my web app backend supports old browsers, my scripts support old browser (thanks to jquery 1), but my CSS suddenly needs latest browsers
[16:34:48] <acidjazz> you said backend
[16:38:00] <onr> no fancy ajaxy angulary backbony stuff
[16:38:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?

[17:47:16] <crich> Quick question for you guys
[18:54:39] <Robdgreat> please just ask... oh, you're gone
[18:54:51] <Robdgreat> what's wrong with people?
[18:55:06] <Robdgreat> there are 600 freakin' people in here. Just ask your question
[18:55:12] <Robdgreat> someone is bound to see it
[18:56:08] <Robdgreat> we need a bot trigger where if the first thing someone says after joining contains the word "question", it instructs them to just ask the damned thing
[18:56:17] <jak2000> Robdgreat how are you?
[18:56:29] * Robdgreat steps off his soapbox
[18:56:37] <Robdgreat> I'm great, jak2000. How are you?
[18:57:00] <jak2000> coding and understanding jquery
[18:57:13] <Robdgreat> sweet
[18:57:17] <Robdgreat> I'm procrastinating
[18:58:21] <jak2000> Robdgreat what is your principal programming language, on the server 1) JSP 2) Ruby 3) Delphi 4) PHP? 5 ASP?
[18:59:05] <Robdgreat> that's a poor question. at least in multiple choice format. What if it'd been Perl?
[18:59:12] <Robdgreat> It's PHP, btw
[19:14:01] <jak2000> perl  disappear in the next 5 years
[19:14:07] <jak2000> same as cobol.
[19:14:15] <Robdgreat> we'll see.
[19:14:29] <Robdgreat> because I'm confident people said that 5 years ago
[19:14:54] <Robdgreat> people keep saying things are going to go away and they keep being wrong
[19:15:02] <rcyr> Perl is already dead.. unless you're blind.
[19:15:17] <rcyr> It has been dead for at least 10 years now.
[19:15:27] <Robdgreat> fcvo dead
[19:15:42] <Robdgreat> so if I'm blind, then it's not dead?
[19:15:46] <Robdgreat> how does that work?
[19:15:49] <rcyr> I guess
[19:16:45] <jak2000> rcyr Robdgreat and what is your opinion of Delphi?
[19:17:00] <Robdgreat> I didn't know anyone still used Delphi
[19:17:24] <rcyr> Same :P
[19:17:31] <Robdgreat> I'm not going to make a meaningless statement like "Delphi is dead", though
[19:17:35] <Robdgreat> because that's idiotic
[19:17:50] <Robdgreat> I prefer to stick to facts
[19:18:00] <rcyr> A language is considered dead when no new development is done using it.
[19:18:26] <Robdgreat> so no one ever uses perl to write new code
[19:18:29] <Robdgreat> can you prove this?
[19:19:07] <rcyr> Robdgreat: Nope, it's just an anecdote based on observation. I highly doubt you'll see a mathematical proof of this.
[19:19:18] <Robdgreat> I didn't use the word mathematical, but ok
[19:20:01] <Robdgreat> There's really nothing to be gained from making spurious claims based on no evidence
[19:20:10] <Robdgreat> but maybe I overvalue credibility
[19:21:15] <rcyr> Or maybe you really like Perl...
[19:21:16] <Robdgreat> disclaimer: I don't use perl at all
[19:21:22] <rcyr> Great :)
[19:21:25] <Robdgreat> I like truth
[19:24:16] <Robdgreat> https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=created%3A%3E2015-01-01+language%3APerl&type=Repositories&ref=advsearch&l=Perl more than even I thought
[20:18:29] <Zeranoe> how is it that .load() seems to function on a local machine (no server), when it's an AJAX component?
[22:14:39] <tash> anyone in here use dataTable?
[22:15:14] <tash> I can't figure out why my copy, csv, xls, and pdf buttons aren't showing up

[22:55:59] <pecey> Hello. Need some help again.
[22:56:20] <pecey> Trying to trigger a input field on a div click
[22:56:29] <pecey> but the dialog isnt appearing
[22:56:43] <pecey> here is the code : http://pastebin.com/jjxskYpR
[23:30:19] <Cork> pecey: could you create a jsfiddle of what you're trying to do?
[23:30:35] <pecey> Cork, gimme a minute :)
[23:30:56] <Cork> pastebin is rarely useful for these kind of questions
[23:31:13] <Cork> the code is dead and can't be used to understand the context
[23:31:55] <Uhkis> also, pastebin.com is full of ads
[23:32:12] <Cork> heh didn't even know that :)
[23:32:41] <Uhkis> i don't use adblock at work, the internet is a horrible place :D
[23:32:59] <Cork> ya it is
[23:33:07] <Cork> i consider adblock of some sort a must
[23:34:30] <pecey> Cork, something like this
[23:34:50] <pecey> my bad
[23:34:53] <pecey> sorry solvd
[23:35:20] <Cork> and that is the second reason why you should make a jsfiddle :)
[23:35:26] <pecey> haha. thanks
[23:35:33] <Cork> it very often makes you solve the problem yourself :D
[23:35:34] <Uhkis> Cork: i even told coworkers to uninstall it _at work_ after "fixing" a bunch of tickets by "Disable adblock" :D
[23:35:50] <pecey> Cork, will keep that in mind next time :)
[23:39:43] <jak2000> hi
[23:41:34] <Cork> heh http://k74.imgup.net/flashe13d.jpg
[23:42:50] <Uhkis> poor little flash
[23:44:35] <jak2000> wich is the diference: var $myvar=0.15; and var myvar=0.15; ?
[23:45:07] <Cork> none
[23:45:08] <Uhkis> name
[23:45:15] <Cork> one has $ in the name the other doesn't
[23:45:40] <Cork> jak2000: many as in MANY php developers write $ for variables in js
[23:45:55] <Cork> but it isn't needed or have any special meaning
[23:46:16] <Uhkis> i use $name to mark jQuery object
[23:46:18] <Uhkis> s
[23:46:30] <jak2000> ok then o trick
[23:46:32] <jak2000> notrick
[23:46:34] <Cork> another common case is to use $ in variable names to represent jquery instances
[23:47:01] <Cork> jak2000: ya, $() confused me quite a bit when i started using jquery
[23:47:22] <Cork> until i understood it was just a normal function named $
[23:47:59] <jak2000> yea
[23:48:46] <Cork> ah.. good old jquery 1.0 :D
[23:48:55] <Cork> it sure has changed a lot since >_>
[23:51:33] <jak2000> Cork you know about Swift?
[23:51:38] <jak2000> what do you think about?
[23:51:55] <Cork> luckely i don't need to write ios native apps
[23:52:06] <Cork> so no i don't know anything about it
[23:52:12] <Cork> i don't care about mac only languages
