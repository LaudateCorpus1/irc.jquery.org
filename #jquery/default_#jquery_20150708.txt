[00:05:20] <mdev> ?api thanks Cork
[00:12:27] <hellyeah> hey
[00:13:46] <hellyeah> it gave me rgb(0, 0, 255) that but i want to get blue but there is no .text() function how can i get text value of background-color http://jsfiddle.net/sycngfsh/2/
[00:21:04] <hellyeah> hey my button is blue but why it doesnt work http://jsfiddle.net/js2wrydd/7/
[00:39:23] <Kartagis> hellyeah: define "doesn't work"
[00:39:36] <Kartagis> hellyeah: and lose thar ugly colour,
[00:39:49] <Kartagis> it makes people's eyes bleed
[00:40:33] <hellyeah> from button or from table?
[00:41:42] <hellyeah> Kartagis:  check line 94 you will see what i mean with "doesnt work"
[00:41:43] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/js2wrydd/7/
[00:41:57] <hellyeah> i need to get text value of color like blue red orange
[00:43:25] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/js2wrydd/8/
[00:44:22] <Kartagis> hellyeah: console.log doesn't give me blue
[00:44:34] <Kartagis> it gives rgb...
[00:46:54] <hellyeah> yea
[00:47:01] <hellyeah> i need to convert it to blue
[00:47:08] <hellyeah> i am searching a way to do that
[00:47:14] <hellyeah> every color has rbg value right
[00:49:04] <Cork> hellyeah: the browser keeps rgb internally
[00:49:09] <Cork> so ya, that is expected
[00:50:16] <hellyeah> yes sure just wondering is there a way to get string version of gbg like rbg(128,128,128) is gray
[00:50:32] <Cork> you would have to keep a translation array
[00:51:44] <hellyeah> humm
[00:52:14] <hellyeah> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.map/
[01:04:03] <arup_r> I can select the text or val of the selected option using `$('#user_county').val();` or `$('#user_county').text();`
[01:04:23] <arup_r> how would I select the `data` atribute value like I have `data-state`
[01:04:47] <arup_r> **fetch not **select
[01:05:34] <Uhkis> ?api data @ arup_r
[01:05:34] <b-ot> arup_r: .data(): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[01:05:49] <arup_r> tried not working
[01:06:29] <arup_r> I tried `var county = $('#user_county').data('state');`
[01:06:57] <Uhkis> what is that element
[01:08:11] <Cork> arup_r: you would have to select the option and extract the data directly
[01:08:21] <arup_r> ok
[01:08:21] <Cork> arup_r: val and text works on the select element
[01:08:28] <arup_r> I see
[01:12:01] <arup_r> Cork: worked `var state = $('#user_county').find(":selected").data('state');`
[01:12:23] <hellyeah> jquery has method like contains?
[01:13:22] <Cork> hellyeah: what do you mean?
[01:13:25] <arup_r> yes
[01:13:27] <arup_r> I think
[01:13:45] <arup_r> CSS selector has the method as I remember
[01:13:55] <Cork> no
[01:14:02] <Cork> css doesn't have contains
[01:14:03] <arup_r> Yes nothing is present
[01:14:15] <arup_r> I messed up with Xpath
[01:14:21] <arup_r> Cork: us true
[01:14:29] <arup_r> *is
[01:14:31] <Cork> jquery have a function that serializes the children into html and text searches in the result
[01:14:40] <Cork> but you should avoid it
[01:15:09] <hellyeah> well i have trs and and this tr has background-color property
[01:15:23] <hellyeah> i want to check which tr has background-color:blue or something
[01:15:40] <Cork> hellyeah: no, set a class and use that
[01:16:00] <Cork> you should DEFINITELY never ever select based on css properties
[01:16:20] <Cork> kitties will die!
[01:16:50] <hellyeah> no actually
[01:17:15] <hellyeah> if tr has background-color: orange i want to animate the button with orange color
[01:17:28] <Cork> hellyeah: so create a class "orange" and use that
[01:17:39] <Cork> don't base it on css properties
[01:17:58] * AdamPDotty would prefer a semantic class name.
[01:18:11] <hellyeah> it can be gray also
[01:18:12] <Cork> unless you actually intentionally want to write horrible solution with bad performance
[01:18:20] <Cork> hellyeah: so create two classes
[01:18:22] <hellyeah> do i need to create two classes
[01:18:25] <hellyeah> humm
[01:18:25] <Cork> classes are cheap
[01:18:35] <hellyeah> actuallly dont have any idea about creating class
[01:19:04] <Cork> .gray { background-color: gray; } .orange { background-color: orange; }
[01:19:06] <hellyeah> is there smt you can suggest?
[01:19:06] <Cork> done
[01:19:11] <hellyeah> damn
[01:19:29] <hellyeah> is that simple?
[01:19:35] <Cork> its css...
[01:19:43] <hellyeah> hmm
[01:19:44] <hellyeah> ic
[01:19:53] <hellyeah> i supposed i will create js class
[01:19:59] <Cork> no... >_<'
[01:19:59] <hellyeah> and do some prototypes?
[01:20:01] <Cork> not js class
[01:20:03] <hellyeah> :D
[01:20:04] <Cork> css class
[01:20:13] <Cork> just add those to your css file
[01:20:37] <Cork> seriously, have you learned the basics of web development?
[01:20:38] <hellyeah> sure i added
[01:20:59] <hellyeah> Cork:  i am kinda new
[01:20:59] <Cork> sounds like you're fiddling in the wrong end if you don't even know how to write css rules
[01:21:12] <Cork> hellyeah: so start with learning html and css
[01:21:13] <hellyeah> i know how to write css rules
[01:21:17] <Cork> THEN start with js
[01:21:21] <hellyeah> i know html css
[01:21:33] <hellyeah> i just supposed before you type in css rules
[01:21:36] <Cork> hellyeah: then... why the confused reaction?
[01:22:29] <hellyeah> Cork:  still i didnt have solid grasp
[01:22:42] <hellyeah> but i am able to do some stuff and understand quickly
[01:23:09] <arup_r> I am trying to show only the county for which state does match and where there is a value in state already while doing page load.. but it is showing all the county options
[01:23:14] <arup_r> https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/db02b75833d2df97c6ef
[01:23:35] <Cork> arup_r: didn't i give you a solution for that yesterday?
[01:24:26] <arup_r> Yes... Now I added one more extension..
[01:24:41] <arup_r> I am using your solution only..
[01:25:15] <arup_r> But I didn't handle the case when there will be county already selected what to do..
[01:25:28] <arup_r> to code this later part I added now some if else logic
[01:25:32] <arup_r> and it is not working
[01:26:00] <Cork> arup_r: why not just do .trigger('change') on state on page load?
[01:26:10] <Cork> i don't see why you need the rest
[01:27:13] <arup_r> I am new ... to Jquery ... I write what I found in Google .. :/ I never know the method you just said
[01:27:28] <Cork> ?api trigger
[01:27:28] <b-ot> Cork: .trigger(): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[01:29:08] <AdamPDotty> So wahts the difference between trigger('change') and change() ?
[01:29:22] <Cork> change() (without arguments) is a shorthand
[01:29:41] <AdamPDotty> Ah, so I thought, thanks.
[01:30:16] <Cork> but ya, cause those functions are so overloaded it... is a bit messy
[01:34:21] <arup_r> I tried as you said https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/db02b75833d2df97c6ef .. But when the `state` is true I am seeing county has no value inside it..
[01:34:32] <arup_r> I am doing it wrong it seemsd
[01:34:36] <Cork> do you have the fiddle from yesterday?
[01:34:51] <Cork> gist is quite useless in these cases
[01:35:31] <arup_r> no I don't have. should I  make a new one
[01:35:32] <arup_r> ?
[01:35:41] <Cork> i'll try to dig it up
[01:35:48] <arup_r> making
[01:36:21] <arup_r> It just works when conuty has no value.. but when county already has value it doesn't work
[01:38:05] <tumulte> I have a code in front of me like that http://paste.debian.net/280099/
[01:38:18] <tumulte> how ugly is that... and why write this this way ?
[01:38:33] <Cork> arup_r: https://jsfiddle.net/ybj3s10p/4/
[01:39:40] <Cork> tumulte: heh, ya that one could be cleaned up quite a bit
[01:39:43] <arup_r> now we don't need clone()?
[01:39:59] <Uhkis> tumulte: not everyone is a pro
[01:40:00] <Cork> arup_r: have you forgotten the conversation about that?
[01:40:16] <arup_r> No.. I remember now
[01:40:40] <tumulte> Uhkis: yeah for sure
[01:41:19] <Uhkis> is that censored or are there really foo and bar tags? :P
[01:41:33] <tumulte> Uhkis: cencored
[01:41:48] <tumulte> Uhkis: but there's a foo variable somewhere in the real deal
[01:41:50] <tumulte> :D
[01:42:20] <Cork> why sensor css selectors ?!?
[01:42:51] <tumulte> Cork: I didn't "censor", I just rewrote a simpler example. The real code is even messier
[01:43:11] <Uhkis> tumulte: starting to sound like someone without any coding experience copy pasting examples
[01:43:28] <tumulte> Cork: but I had password and creditcard numbers in my selectors
[01:43:38] <Cork> O_o'
[01:43:40] <tumulte> that's the only way I can remember them :)
[01:43:45] <arup_r> Cork: it worked.. buy only thing is previous selection of county value is not showing now.. I understand the reason .. need to make it work.. let me try something else
[01:44:05] <Cork> arup_r: its the .val('')
[01:44:30] <Cork> it is quite simple store the value before the filter
[01:44:40] <arup_r> yes.. that is for state dropdown.. I am talking about the county dropdown
[01:44:46] <tumulte> Uhkis: however, it's so far away from what I'd do, I wanted to ask if this all could have some hidden benefits
[01:44:54] <Cork> no, i'm talking about the country
[01:44:56] <arup_r> I am storing it and then I'll select it
[01:45:02] <arup_r> got you
[01:45:12] <tumulte> Uhkis: rather than a plain $(this).find('bar')...
[01:45:52] <Uhkis> closest goes the other way iirc?
[01:46:16] <tumulte> Uhkis: you're right. Rather than a plain $(this).closest
[01:47:20] <Uhkis> well i don't see any point doing that me mess :D
[01:50:23] <arup_r> Cork: worked https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/db02b75833d2df97c6ef
[01:50:31] <arup_r> I don't again if I missed any logic :)
[01:50:41] <Cork> what did i say about gists >_<
[01:50:50] <arup_r> Ok.. soryy
[01:50:55] <arup_r> humm
[01:51:47] <tumulte> Cork: Uhkis thanks :)
[01:52:00] <Cork> arup_r: ex. https://jsfiddle.net/ybj3s10p/5/
[01:52:23] <arup_r> Fiidle is so slow here.. I am not able to update it :
[01:53:58] <arup_r> trying to understand the code the `pipe` one ofcourse
[01:55:14] <arup_r> why this line needed? county_selection = undefined;
[01:55:23] <arup_r> asking to tech me
[01:56:01] <arup_r> ok to clear the old value for next load.. am I right ?
[01:57:00] <arup_r> thanks Cork:
[01:57:08] <Cork> arup_r: no to clear the old value for when the user changes the state dropdown
[01:58:05] <arup_r> didn't get you
[02:00:09] <Sourcey> Hello, I need to change the value of a a href element. This is snippet my current code : http://pastebin.com/Gb2sRWDH - described in big letters what I need help with
[02:00:44] <Cork> Sourcey: .prop('href', new_href)
[02:01:16] <Sourcey> btw, need to change whats between > </a>. Not the a href it self
[02:01:27] <Sourcey> In this case "faktureringsgrunnlag"
[02:01:27] <arup_r> Without the line also it is working Cork:
[02:01:30] <Cork> so... the link text not the href?
[02:02:05] <Sourcey> yep
[02:02:09] <Cork> Sourcey: well as long as the event handlers element is a parent that should work
[02:03:56] <Sourcey> ah, was wrong with parents
[02:05:03] <Sourcey> can i search for the a href ID instead ?
[02:05:09] <Sourcey> it changes all my a href now
[02:40:55] <dimi1947> I have set up with CSS the border of a textare to none...the problem is that I set the border with jquery-   $('textarea').css({'border':'5px'});-it does not have any effect...despite the border property being shown in the markup....no border is displayed
[02:45:13] <Cork> dimi1947: set the css in the css file
[02:48:12] <dimi1947> you mean not use jquery's css() at all?
[02:55:38] <Cork> dimi1947: ya
[02:55:47] <Cork> if you need to trigger it from js, use a class
[02:55:55] <Cork> css should be in the css file
[02:56:37] <Cork> for ease of maintenance, testing and readability
[03:32:23] <Caelum> can you do something like $('img').filter(...).one('load', ....).length to see if anything matched?
[03:33:53] <Caelum> you can, awesome
[03:37:45] <Cork> Caelum: yes, but i'm not sure if you're expecting .one() to affect it in any way
[03:37:52] <Cork> (it won't)
[03:38:49] <Caelum> it will if the filter returned stuff
[03:39:08] <Caelum> right?
[03:39:29] <Caelum> seems to work here
[03:40:04] <Cork> Caelum: one adds event listeners
[03:40:13] <Cork> it doesn't affect the selector results
[03:40:49] <Cork> meaning length will be the same for $('img').filter(...).length and  $('img').filter(...).one('load', ....).length
[03:41:50] <Caelum> yes that is what I want
[03:42:08] <Caelum> I want to add event listeners and also check if any were added
[04:00:46] <ganeshaditya1> Hey, so I have multiple links with a onclick event that points to the same js function. Now how do I get the element inside that function on which click happened so I could like change the text of the link or something.
[04:01:06] <ganeshaditya1> I tried $(this) but it doesnt work
[04:01:53] <Cork> ganeshaditya1: don't use event attributes
[04:02:04] <Cork> use event listeners instead and it will work
[04:03:19] <ganeshaditya1> @Cork ................. ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh have to change a lot of code man. Is there anything I could do for this to work even with event attributes? This is sort of a hobby project so I ve been a bit careless
[04:04:01] <Cork> ganeshaditya1: somewhat, but it depends on the code you have
[04:04:25] <Cork> but ya event attributes are BAD it is still around for legacy code, you shouldn't use it
[04:05:50] <ganeshaditya1> mmm... thanks man :)
[04:45:54] <sopparus> doesnt draggable exist in jquery 2.0 anymore?
[04:48:24] <neophitosaure> Hello guys

[05:06:43] <b-ot> arc_: No matches.
[05:06:53] <arc_> it's jqueryui anyway
[05:16:17] <Abhijit> "From Jquery" how can I raise a flask abort error access forbidden and reridect to that error page?
[05:18:07] <yottabyte> Hi y'all, how would I get the value of the <td> tag that's below the <h4> that contains the text as shown here: http://jsfiddle.net/LL1ajw6s/1/
[05:18:20] <marduk1984> what is this char called ' ?
[05:18:29] <yottabyte> apostrophe
[05:18:34] <marduk1984> thanks
[05:18:42] <yottabyte> np
[05:35:59] <yottabyte> figured out how to do it in JQ: http://jsfiddle.net/LL1ajw6s/2/
[05:39:53] <Cork> ugg..
[05:40:03] <Cork> yottabyte: why not just give then a class instead?
[05:40:15] <Cork> selecting based on text content is a really really bad idea
[05:40:34] <yottabyte> I know — not a choice, it's a precompiled email (parsing an email html body)
[05:41:18] <Cork> yottabyte: why not just do $('.desired-result table:first td') instead for example?
[05:41:37] <yottabyte> because I didn't know haha, that's just what I came up with after thinking about it
[05:41:41] <yottabyte> but cool
[05:41:47] <yottabyte> is that a standard css selector?
[05:41:52] <Cork> :first isn't
[05:41:55] <Cork> but the rest is
[05:42:09] <Cork> ?api :first
[05:42:09] <b-ot> Cork: :first Selector: Selects the first matched element. http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
[05:42:20] <Cork> the standard selector is first-child
[05:42:32] <Cork> but it wouldn't match the table (as h4 is the first child)
[05:42:53] <yottabyte> oh wait, I need the Native Size portion cause there's multiple <h4>'s and multiple tables
[05:43:12] <Cork> and you don't know the position you want it from?
[05:43:25] <yottabyte> nope
[05:43:30] <Cork> ex the firth table
[05:43:37] <yottabyte> it's a very long email, and it's subject to change
[05:43:40] <Cork> hmmm, ok kinda pitty but...
[05:43:42] <yottabyte> it's a database generated health check
[05:44:14] <yottabyte> so depending on what queries run (depends on an xml file), the html output changes dynamically
[05:44:31] <yottabyte> they only thing I know for certain is the text in the headers in the general layout of the html
[05:44:36] <Cork> ok, not much else is an option then
[05:44:41] <yottabyte> yeah =\
[05:45:06] <yottabyte> you wouldn't be familiar with C# and anglesharp would you?...
[05:45:13] <yottabyte> kind of off topic but I thought I'd ask
[05:46:51] <Cork> a little, but ya "'no time for that" ;)
[05:47:12] <yottabyte> k
[05:47:28] <Cork> to be honest, haven't touched it in like... 8 years
[05:47:42] <Cork> never been impressed with iis
[05:52:21] <toomus> Hi all
[06:02:09] <Raverix_> Hello, is there a slick way to find the common elements from two jQuery results? Think: var set1 = $('#a, #b, #c'),    set2 = $('#b, #c, #d'),    common = someMagicFunction(); //Needs to return equivilent of $('#b, #c')
[06:02:19] <Raverix_> http://jsfiddle.net/hwce4v5q/
[06:02:46] <Raverix_> I suppose I could write use filter() with a custom callbak to filter out, but I'm curious if there's a better way.
[06:17:34] <notchris> Good morning all
[06:21:27] <Raverix_> G'morning notchris
[06:22:53] <shoky_> Raverix_: you can pass a jquery object to .filter  e.g.  set1.filter(set2)
[06:23:18] <notchris> Raverix_: mornin!
[06:25:26] <Raverix_> shoky_: See, I knew there had to be a better way that me writing me own filter. I didn't know you could do that, thank you.
[07:07:39] <DeltaHeavy> Hey. I have some custom jQuery-UI widgets and I want to attach them to content loaded via AJAX. I need to add them to the DOM as siblings of a bunch of other elements with the widget applied to them. I was wondering how I could only apply the widget to the new elements. I was thinking I could attach some sort of identifiers to these elements though I was thinking it'd be better if I could render these widgets outside of the docum
[07:07:51] <DeltaHeavy> then insert them into the document. Is this possible?
[07:08:27] <Cork> no
[07:08:54] <Cork> you have to insert them into the document for it to be visible
[07:09:51] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: I know they need to be in the document to be visible, but could they be rendered outside of it and have the JS widgets attached. They don't need to be visible at that point but THEN they'd be inserted into the document.
[07:10:14] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: like i said, no
[07:10:27] <Cork> you can build a detactched dom fragment
[07:10:31] <DeltaHeavy> Ok, wasn't quite clear to me. Do you have any sort of suggestion for accomplishing this?
[07:10:34] <Cork> but it won't render until you attach it
[07:10:54] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: Detached DOM fragment? Sounds like what I was trying to describe.
[07:10:56] <Cork> if you need to modify the dom structure for things you append
[07:11:02] <DeltaHeavy> Ok I see
[07:11:05] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, I'd need to do that.
[07:11:06] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: not really
[07:11:13] <DeltaHeavy> I understand now. Thanks!
[07:11:17] <Cork> you will still have to "know" where you've added them
[07:19:11] <NikoZz> I send a json through an ajax call and all the boolean values are converted to strings. any solution to this?
[07:23:48] <ceramicskull> shoky here?
[07:24:08] <ceramicskull> shoky_ here? : p
[07:24:20] <taplar> NikoZz: you'll have to convert it on the back end
[07:24:40] <NikoZz> taplar: not that easy :/
[07:24:53] <NikoZz> taplar: so I am not doing anything wrong on the frontend?
[07:25:07] <taplar> NikoZz: no, http requests send data as text
[07:25:22] <taplar> NikoZz: just the nature of the beast
[07:25:39] <NikoZz> taplar: you are 100% of what you are saying?
[07:25:45] <NikoZz> 100% sure*
[07:25:50] <taplar> NikoZz: yep
[07:25:52] <NikoZz> :/
[07:26:24] <NikoZz> dataType: json shouldnt help to send it correct?
[07:26:44] <taplar> that auto converts the json into the format that the request will accept
[07:26:50] <taplar> the back end will have to then parse it
[07:27:10] <NikoZz> taplar: ok many thanks
[07:32:58] <ganeshaditya1> Hey so I have a link a couple of divs deep and I have a click event defined for that link.Of all the divs that contain this link there is a div with a particular class name. How can I get this div? Is there a direct function for this?
[07:33:30] <taplar> ganeshaditya1: you want to do this when?  on click of the link?
[07:33:41] <ganeshaditya1> @taplar yes.
[07:33:54] <taplar> ganeshaditya1: $(this).closest('.whateverTheClassIs')
[07:34:05] <ganeshaditya1> ohhhoo .. Thanks man :)
[07:36:50] <ganeshaditya1> @taplar, is there a function that does the opposite of this? as in search the children elements for a particular class name?
[07:37:11] <taplar> $(this).find(...)
[07:37:19] <ganeshaditya1> ohhoo!
[07:37:37] <taplar> well
[07:37:44] <taplar> i should say $(selector).find(...)
[07:37:57] <taplar> just in the case of the event you can use the element you have
[07:39:24] <ganeshaditya1> got it!
[07:42:55] <ganeshaditya1> @taplar <div><div><span class = "something"></span></div><a>asd</a></div> Should I be doing a $(this).closest(".something").text("Asd") ???
[07:43:24] <taplar> that a is not a child of something
[07:43:50] <ganeshaditya1> @taplar yes this is a different case. How can I get the span tag?
[07:44:02] <taplar> $(this).parent().find('.something')
[07:44:27] <ganeshaditya1> okay. no direct functions?
[07:44:56] <taplar> not really
[07:45:28] <shoky_> ceramicskull: hy
[07:45:46] <ceramicskull> ello - it's triggerclickhelp :D
[07:45:53] <shoky_> heys
[07:45:58] <ceramicskull> I figured out the issue btw
[07:46:03] <ceramicskull> it was like two lines of code D:
[07:46:16] <shoky_> glad to hear ;]
[07:46:21] <Ice_Strike> How to access to class that has been created via ajax?
[07:46:39] <ceramicskull> huehue, switching to dataTable helped a lot more
[07:47:01] <Ice_Strike> I want to $(".something").html("something") but the content from .something is created via ajax
[07:47:07] <ceramicskull> they have a function called fnAddData(); which literally does what we were trying to do
[07:47:17] <DeltaHeavy> Ice_Strike: It being added via AJAX makes no difference.
[07:47:37] <taplar> Ice_Strike: for a selector to work, it has to have been added to the dom first
[07:47:38] <Ice_Strike> I dont think I explained well.
[07:48:03] <Ice_Strike> Yea I want to execute the selector but dom are created via ajax.
[07:48:26] <taplar> Ice_Strike: that is not an issue, regardless of how they were created, if they are on the dom, it can find them
[07:49:23] <Ice_Strike> I understand that $(".block").on("click",".btn",function(e) { $(".something").html("something") }
[07:49:26] <Ice_Strike> It will find them
[07:49:37] <Ice_Strike> But I don't want to use click or any other event.
[07:49:48] <taplar> Ice_Strike: you don't have to
[07:50:04] <taplar> Ice_Strike: what is your issue that your trying to resolve?
[07:51:07] <Ice_Strike> Oh it is ok, now.
[07:51:39] <Ice_Strike> Let me show you example.
[07:54:13] <sopparus> anyone know if its possible to resize the "mid air" object when you use draggable
[07:54:21] <sopparus> im dragging en antire row, and its too big
[07:54:24] <sopparus> an
[07:56:19] <Cork> sopparus: sure it has a class
[07:56:29] <Cork> you can style it with css or grab it with js
[07:57:00] <Ice_Strike> taplar http://pastebin.com/098MjNQ3
[07:57:15] <Cork> sopparus: http://webdevel.blogspot.se/2008/09/jquery-ui-draggables-helper-css-class.html
[07:57:44] <sopparus> ah
[07:57:45] <sopparus> thanks
[07:58:00] <taplar> Ice_Strike: that is true, your outer most selector is not guarenteed to work as the data may not be there until the ajax call finishes and adds the data to the dom
[07:58:13] <Ice_Strike> I understand
[07:58:23] <Ice_Strike> So what is the solution.
[07:58:32] <taplar> Ice_Strike: rethink your logic
[07:58:54] <Cork> Ice_Strike: disable the button until the ajax has completed?
[07:59:02] <Cork> show a spinner there until then?
[07:59:32] <Ice_Strike> Oh yea.
[08:04:53] <felixjet__> if i'm looping over a getElementsByClassName, can i select each child using  $(x[i] + ' > .median span') ?
[08:05:30] <felixjet__> or better yet, how i can select that siblings inside a class-loop elements?
[08:06:01] <taplar> $.children() and $.siblings()
[08:06:09] <felixjet__> lets say i want to change the text of all spans inside <li><div class="median"><span>
[08:06:29] <felixjet__> but each span, using a different text
[08:06:44] <felixjet__> i need to loop the <li>s
[08:06:57] <felixjet__> and select them by "> .median span"
[08:07:32] <mrbubbles> Hi folks, just quick one. If I’m using .getJSON should HTML encoded characters in the result automatically be decoded?
[08:07:43] <felixjet__> taplar, which one?
[08:08:25] <taplar> $.children() will return all directly nested element nodes.  $.siblings() will return elements on the same level as the selected element
[08:08:38] <taplar> ?api children
[08:08:38] <b-ot> taplar: .children(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[08:08:43] <taplar> ?api siblings
[08:08:43] <b-ot> taplar: .siblings(): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[08:11:46] <felixjet__> so children
[08:14:33] <Ice_Strike> What do you think of this code http://pastebin.com/m5sqMfru
[08:14:41] <Ice_Strike> on the filter part
[08:14:48] <Ice_Strike> or can it be better?
[08:15:08] <taplar> mrbubbles: by html encoded characters are you talking about like &quote; ?
[08:15:16] <mrbubbles> yep exaclty
[08:15:33] <taplar> mrbubbles: my guess is it would not
[08:15:39] <mrbubbles> instead of ‘ i’m seeing &#8217;s in the json which is fine i
[08:15:43] <mrbubbles> I’m just not sure how to then decode it
[08:17:02] <Ice_Strike> taplar see my pastbin :)
[08:17:15] <taplar> mrbubbles: quick search has a suggested answer as: $("<div/>").html(encodedStr).text();
[08:17:26] <mrbubbles> yep I saw that but apparently it’s unsafe
[08:17:44] <mrbubbles> I’m using Handlebars so going to check if that has a decode method
[08:18:16] <mrbubbles> Aaah it looks like handlebars encodes automatically when you output using {{}} but you can stop it from doing so using {{{}}}
[08:18:18] <mrbubbles> nice :D
[08:18:49] <taplar> Ice_Strike: seems fine.  you might store $(this) in a variable and reuse it, but that's a small thing for your use case so far
[08:20:22] <Ice_Strike> Would that improve performance?
[08:20:38] <taplar> Ice_Strike: in your use case, minisculely
[08:20:40] <taplar> :)
[08:20:48] <Ice_Strike> ;)
[08:21:13] <taplar> it can in other cases, so it's a best practice to recommend
[08:21:27] <taplar> imho
[08:23:33] <Ice_Strike> I see
[08:23:34] <mrbubbles> Yep also it saves the issue where the scope of $(this) changes in a block, for example with promises
[08:23:35] <Ice_Strike> thanks :)
[08:35:10] <goldfinger> is it possible to apply @media css queries using jQuery?
[08:35:39] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia
[08:35:55] <robertmaxrees> no real support in jquery last i checked.
[08:35:57] <goldfinger> robertmaxrees: thankss!
[08:36:06] <goldfinger> what mean by that?
[08:36:27] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't provide any mechanism to detect / apply media queries.
[08:36:32] <robertmaxrees> also - look at the browser on that mdn page.
[08:37:43] <goldfinger> robertmaxrees: so that means it could become deprecated some day?
[08:37:50] <goldfinger> because not enough people find it useful ?
[08:37:54] <robertmaxrees> that means it's not supported in IE9 and below.
[08:38:09] <goldfinger> ah okay
[08:38:18] <goldfinger> and let's say I put that in a function
[08:38:32] <goldfinger> how would i run that function in a .js file
[08:38:34] <goldfinger> ?
[08:38:42] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[08:38:48] <robertmaxrees> theFunction() ?
[08:38:52] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you're asking.
[08:38:56] <goldfinger> that's it right?
[08:39:03] <goldfinger> let me try something
[08:41:56] <Ice_Strike> Is there any such plugin that if I click on icon note, then like a tooltip popup with <textarea>
[08:41:57] <Ice_Strike> ?
[08:42:11] <taplar> look at dialogs for jquery ui
[08:42:30] <robertmaxrees> you could also build something like that with one of the dozens of tooltip libs out there.
[08:42:46] <Ice_Strike> That is popup
[08:43:01] <Ice_Strike> I want something like tooltip pointing to the icon.
[08:43:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah you want a tooltip?
[08:43:08] <Ice_Strike> Yep
[08:43:29] <robertmaxrees> http://stevenbenner.github.io/jquery-powertip/ might be useful?
[08:43:47] <Ice_Strike> I currently use Tooltipster for overthing
[08:43:59] <robertmaxrees> then use that?
[08:44:33] <Ice_Strike> I will see if it possible to stop closing tooltip if mouseout
[08:46:04] <taplar> we used something for that in one of my apps.  bootstrap maybe?
[08:46:05] <taplar> hmm
[08:46:06] <robertmaxrees> look to see if there's a way to manually open and close it.
[08:46:16] <robertmaxrees> all of bootstrap for a tooltip?
[08:46:17] <Ice_Strike> Im looking :)
[08:46:38] <Ice_Strike> I can't use bootstrap on existing websitr
[08:46:43] <Ice_Strike> it mess up all the style
[08:46:47] <taplar> don't remember.  we used various parts of it if that's what it was
[08:47:05] <taplar> and I wasn't the ui/ux over that app, :)
[08:47:52] <Ice_Strike> http://iamceege.github.io/tooltipster/
[08:47:58] <Ice_Strike> look like this will do it.
[08:48:19] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[08:48:22] <Ice_Strike> autoClose, hideOnClick
[09:00:57] <felixjet__> $('.class').each(function(index) { setInterval(function() { $(this)...
[09:01:04] <felixjet__> does this work as i believe?
[09:01:24] <felixjet__> is $(this) available inside setInterval?
[09:04:13] <taplar> felixjet__: this in that case will be relative to the interval function
[09:04:23] <taplar> felixjet__: not the .class instance
[09:06:40] <felixjet__> so.... that = this
[09:06:41] <felixjet__> hehe
[09:07:26] <taplar> felixjet__: to avoid that outside your setInterval save $(this) or this as a varaible and use that variable in the set instance instead
[09:07:59] <felixjet__> yea i know how scope works, but didn't know that affected jquery "this" too
[09:08:17] <taplar> 'this' is a relative scope variable
[09:10:51] <DeltaHeavy> Can anybody think of a way to automatically remove jQuery-UI widgets when the elements they're attached to are removed?
[09:11:26] <taplar> eh, maybe call destroy on them first?  believe that is an option
[09:12:07] <DeltaHeavy> taplar: I'd rather it be on an event rather than having to write new JS each time I want to remove an instance of a widget.
[09:13:32] <taplar> hmm, well you could attach a custom event to your widget that when called does the destroy and removal
[09:14:19] <DeltaHeavy> taplar: Don't want to depend on people using that correctly. Lots of times .html() is just going to be called removing those elements from the DOM
[09:14:36] <taplar> DeltaHeavy: can't stop people from being stupid
[09:14:41] <DeltaHeavy> True
[09:14:49] <Kartagis> hi. I've got this script that works independently, but not on a json response. any ideas why? http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/gtfpa4oq/15/
[09:14:56] <DeltaHeavy> Though I tried attaching an event on removal but I don't think it's sanely possible
[09:15:22] <taplar> DeltaHeavy: only thing i can think of off the top of my head would be an observer
[09:16:07] <taplar> DeltaHeavy: hit up the googs for "html5, ObjectObserver"
[09:17:12] <DeltaHeavy> taplar: It's barely supported by anybody http://caniuse.com/#search=observe
[09:17:34] <taplar> yeah, :)
[09:18:25] <DeltaHeavy> I need IE9+
[09:18:26] <taplar> Kartagis: what do you mean 'on a json response' ?
[09:19:12] <taplar> Kartagis: are you pulling in that script with getScript or something?
[09:19:36] <Kartagis> taplar: it's supposed to Title Case my response, and I've added it as a resource
[09:19:46] <taplar> k
[09:19:50] <Kartagis> http://html.webcinizim.com/to-title-case.js
[09:22:53] <DeltaHeavy> taplar: Looks like all of data for each widget instance is stored within the DOM
[09:23:18] <taplar> Kartagis: btw, you could simplify your create element function, or remove it, by doing $('<a>', { class: 'value' });
[09:23:23] <DeltaHeavy> $('.element-with-widget').data() seems to return a bunch of info and the widget is stored in the prototype
[09:23:29] <DeltaHeavy> So I guess I just need to remove it from the DOM
[09:23:55] <taplar> DeltaHeavy: even better
[09:24:48] <Kartagis> taplar: like var a=$('<a>', {class:'a'};?
[09:25:07] <taplar> Kartagis: yup, with a closing )
[09:25:29] <Kartagis> riight
[09:25:41] <Kartagis> that will shorten this
[09:25:46] <Kartagis> thanks :)
[09:26:18] <Kartagis> I was thinking of doing a.attr('class', 'a');
[09:26:24] <Kartagis> afterwards
[09:26:28] <taplar> Kartagis: is this what your after? http://jsfiddle.net/gtfpa4oq/16/
[09:27:16] <Kartagis> I could have known, if I wasn't getting undefined :)
[09:46:04] <drz3> hi
[09:46:33] <taplar> hola
[10:04:55] <toon> I have a button in a table, but would like to assign that table to a var. $("#btn").closest("table"); is not working...
[10:07:43] <robertmaxrees> what does your html look like?
[10:07:45] <robertmaxrees> can you share a fiddle?
[10:49:06] <gnarf> Kartagis: I've always prefered (and I think the jQuery team doesn't like that "attributes syntax"
[10:49:22] <gnarf> jQuery("<a>").addClass('a')
[10:49:58] <gnarf> .attr('class') is kind of --- meh?
[10:51:43] <Kartagis> gnarf: which one is preferred then? $('<a>').addClass('a') or $('<a>', {class:'a'}) ? the former is less letters though (I think)
[10:52:02] <taplar> it's up to your tastes really
[10:52:07] <robertmaxrees> "less letters" != "good"
[10:52:29] <robertmaxrees> strive to always be explicit and clear imo.
[10:52:52] <gnarf> Kartagis: $( html, props ) is generally not a "liked" pattern by the team - we've talked about removing and support has changed over the years
[10:52:58] <gnarf> it isn't documented: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[10:53:00] <Kartagis> then again, I think you should be able to do $('<a>', {class:'a',data-lightbox:'lightbox})
[10:53:04] <Kartagis> right?
[10:53:23] <gnarf> oh its way down there
[10:53:23] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery-html-attributes
[10:53:24] <gnarf> sorry
[10:53:54] <robertmaxrees> gnarf that syntax is useful when you don't have a templating system, though your real solution in those cases would be to get a templating system.
[10:56:29] <gnarf> Kartagis: you have to quote "class"
[10:56:30] <gnarf> but yeah
[10:56:32] <gnarf> The name "class" must be quoted in the object since it is a JavaScript reserved word, and "className" cannot be used since it refers to the DOM property, not the attribute.
[10:56:36] <gnarf> ^^^ from docs
[10:56:53] <Kartagis> hrm
[10:57:10] <gnarf> "While the second argument is convenient, its flexibility can lead to unintended consequences (e.g. $( "<input>", {size: "4"} ) calling the .size() method instead of setting the size attribute). The previous code block could thus be written instead as:"
[10:57:17] <gnarf> read that whole section really carefully
[10:57:30] <gnarf> there are a ton of gotchas to the $( html, attrs ) syntax
[11:00:15] <sopparus> hello, anyone who can explain why https://braxnacke.se/soppify/ny/test2.html dont work if I remove float from the css
[11:00:42] <sopparus> .draggable that is
[11:00:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:01:02] <sopparus> its tables
[11:01:04] <sopparus> they can be dragged
[11:01:24] <robertmaxrees> okay - remove what from where?
[11:01:31] <robertmaxrees> (this is why fiddles are great)
[11:01:45] <sopparus> ill do a fiddle
[11:01:47] <sopparus> heh
[11:04:20] <toon> $(".btn") finds all elements with that class, but how do I only get the .btn elements with a jquery variable as parent?
[11:04:28] <robertmaxrees> .closest()
[11:04:53] <robertmaxrees> or $myVar.find('.btn')
[11:05:30] <sopparus> cant get jquery ui to load on fiddle
[11:05:49] <robertmaxrees> sure you can - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yck5hrd7/
[11:07:04] <sopparus> ah
[11:07:06] <sopparus> https://jsfiddle.net/2bywLphL/
[11:07:16] <robertmaxrees> woah
[11:07:19] <robertmaxrees> 1.6.4?
[11:07:20] <sopparus> so, to make it look like a normal table, i need to remove the float there
[11:07:27] <sopparus> I use jquery 2mysef
[11:07:30] <sopparus> ill change :)
[11:07:40] <robertmaxrees> use 2.0.2 and jqui in the fiddle heh
[11:08:10] <sopparus> https://jsfiddle.net/gz3hnh12/
[11:08:35] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gz3hnh12/1/ <- just drop to jquery 2.0.2 and then you get the checkbox.
[11:08:58] <robertmaxrees> so killing float: left; does this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gz3hnh12/2/
[11:09:42] <sopparus> exactly
[11:09:46] <sopparus> undraggable :(
[11:09:57] <robertmaxrees> those drag for me.
[11:10:10] <robertmaxrees> oh chrome.
[11:10:15] <sopparus> yes im on chrome
[11:10:22] <taplar> i can drag on firefox
[11:10:25] <robertmaxrees> iirc tables and draggables don't mix.
[11:10:59] <sopparus> ive seen many fiddles where they do
[11:11:10] <robertmaxrees> tragging the full table, sure.
[11:11:22] <robertmaxrees> dragging trs seems like an exercize in hair pulling.
[11:11:44] <sopparus> https://braxnacke.se/soppify/ny/test.html
[11:11:52] <sopparus> there you can drag tr
[11:13:12] <sopparus> but hm ok
[11:13:12] <robertmaxrees> then copy that and modify it?
[11:13:12] <taplar> if tables have issues with dragging, in those cases would it not be an option to switch to divs and use the whole display table table-row table-cell, etc.. ?
[11:13:22] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gz3hnh12/3/
[11:14:33] <robertmaxrees> works the same way here as in the example you linked.
[11:16:14] <sopparus> oh yeah
[11:16:14] <sopparus> thanks
[11:16:14] <sopparus> see if I can get the table when in mid air to turn into a symbol or somthing
[11:17:09] <taplar> go for an airplane
[11:18:38] <sopparus> :)
[11:19:18] <taplar> or like a dude doing a belly flop, and then have the drop event show a splash image before converting him back
[11:37:04] <toon> why is my function already executed, even when no click has happened??
[11:37:17] <robertmaxrees> are you doing .on('click', functionName());?
[11:37:51] <toon> robertmaxrees, jup!
[11:37:54] <robertmaxrees> remove the ()
[11:37:59] <toon> okay
[11:38:01] <robertmaxrees> just .on('click', functionName);?
[11:38:07] <robertmaxrees> * no ? haha
[11:38:25] <toon> robertmaxrees, how do I pass an argument then?
[11:38:29] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[11:38:46] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're convoluting something - fiddle?
[11:39:01] <toon> okay, so only arguments when using function () { myFunction(param) });
[11:39:08] <sopparus> $(ui.helper).addClass("ui-draggable-helper"); works, can I make (ui.helper) an image easily?
[11:39:17] <robertmaxrees> toon that's a bad idea.
[11:39:32] <robertmaxrees> toon you shouldn't need to pass arguments to event handlers.
[11:39:58] <robertmaxrees> the handler should be abstracted enough that you don't need to pass anything from the binding.
[11:40:06] <toon> okay, this can work as well! thank you very much!
[11:40:18] <robertmaxrees> don't do function () { myFunction(param) }); :(
[11:46:42] <ceramicskull> robertmaxrees
[11:47:18] <ceramicskull> I got the solution to the problem and it wasn't the way we were thinking :l
[12:16:55] <gambl0re> robertmatrix i need your help...

[12:19:37] <taplar> just ascii gambl0re
[12:21:48] <codemonkee> Hi all, I'm trying to build.. what I assume to be a a custom namespace? for extending jQuery, so that I can define functions like so: X.docool = function(z){ $.each(this, function(){ // do stuff }); } and use like so: $('selector').X.docool('stuff'); -- not having any luck. What am I doing wrong?
[12:24:36] <taplar> codemonkee: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.fn.extend/
[12:25:29] <gambl0re> http://rickywid.github.io/streetGenie/
[12:25:55] <gambl0re> it works fine in chrome but in firefox it starts acting weird if anybody wants to try
[12:26:01] <jak2000> hi taplar: can you see: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/qhym3n6x/44/   i need do a for for "detect" Qty no exeed inventory, its ok? or exist a beetter way for do it? thanks
[12:27:10] <codemonkee> taplar: thank you
[12:29:12] <taplar> jak2000: if it works for you, it is all good.  if your interested in something already written you might checkout one of the jquery validate extensions
[12:29:36] <codemonkee> taplar: do you know if there is a native function to extend jQuery itself? i.e. so that I can create my own object, then have each of its methods added? i.e. var X = { foo: function() {//stuff} } then something like $.extend(X) so I can just go $.X.foo
[12:30:01] <jak2000> i do the job but not sure if its ok, the dude is, need do a for and the break?
[12:30:09] <jak2000> wich validate extensions? recommend me
[12:31:09] <taplar> codemonkee: not much experience with extending, but if you want to do something like that you may be able to just attach it directly with $.X = { foo: .... }
[12:31:17] <taplar> codemonkee: not sure if that's recommended or what
[12:31:40] <ceramicskull> jak2000 http://jqueryvalidation.org/ ?
[12:31:45] <codemonkee> I have that part of my code working, I simply have a function (X) whose prototype is extended to add my functions (i.e. X.myfunc=..) , then I simply do: $.X = X; so that I can go $.X.myfunc -- is that the right way?
[12:32:01] <taplar> jak2000: from the website they have a link to this one: https://github.com/DiegoLopesLima/Validate#readme
[12:32:21] <codemonkee> ah okay thanks man, I had that working in like 10 mins, I've been trying to figure out how to extend a namespaced $.fn for the past like 12 hours!! you're a life saver! lol
[12:32:32] <taplar> codemonkee: kudos
[12:32:47] <jak2000> taplar thanks
[12:33:23] <ceramicskull> taplar that one was last updated three years ago d:
[12:34:07] <taplar> heh, can't beat a good thing? :D
[12:35:57] <gambl0re> so jquery work the same in firefox and chrome?
[12:36:36] <taplar> gambl0re: jquery is written to be cross browser compatible as much as possible
[12:36:53] <taplar> the caviot being between v 1.X and 2.X
[12:36:59] <gambl0re> why is my site acting one way in chrome and different way in firfox
[12:37:37] <taplar> gambl0re: vague question, :)
[12:38:00] <gambl0re> http://rickywid.github.io/streetGenie/
[12:38:11] <codemonkee> I actually found someone else trying to do what I'm trying to do: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28618794/extending-jquery-in-custom-namespace
[12:38:16] <gambl0re> if you could take a look in chrome and firefox, you will see some differenes
[12:38:19] <codemonkee> No answers since it was asked in February lol
[12:42:07] <graphettion> gambl0re: Q: Will I be with your Mom? A: It sure seems like it, don't you think?
[12:43:03] <taplar> gambl0re: what differences are you seeing exactly?
[12:43:43] <hep_> I am trying to add a list dynamically and use data-role="listview" but the list is not showing up as it should it looks like a normal list. Do I need to do anything to get the dynamically created list to get styled properly?
[12:43:59] <gambl0re> when you enter the question, click the button, in chrome it displays the question, then displays thinking...then the answer, while
[12:44:11] <gambl0re> in firefox its doing all that simultenously
[12:44:53] <taplar> ah, personal opinion, it wasn't super obvious that there was an input field there... i just thought it was an hr
[12:45:19] <taplar> maybe auto focus on it so you atleast see the blinking cursor to let you know
[12:45:47] <gambl0re> ok
[12:46:30] <gambl0re> do you see the difference?
[12:47:15] <taplar> both my firefox and chrome show the question, then thinking, and then the answer.  granted the first time i did it in chrome the delay for the answer was fairly longer, let me try again
[12:47:59] <gambl0re> its supposed to wait like 10 seconds or so beofre displaying the answer...in firefox is shows it almost immediately
[12:48:15] <taplar> gambl0re: yeah, i'm seeing that difference
[12:48:31] <shoky_> i'm seeing the problem in firefox, it's not jquery being different, it's one of the animation end events behaving differentlty
[12:48:31] <gambl0re> ??
[12:49:02] <gambl0re> the css?
[12:50:12] <shoky_> gambl0re: you're using -webkit-animation-duration   i'd guess that would be an issue in firefox
[12:50:35] <gambl0re> yea i just realized that
[12:51:44] <mikieb> Hi can anyone help me im trying to convert some data using JSON.stringify(). Its returning "[]" im not sure why i've created a jsFiddle with an example here. https://jsfiddle.net/nLcepfv7/30/ console.table shows data that im assuming is correct.
[12:54:48] <shoky_> mikieb: it's because final_results is an array instead of an object.  change it to {} instead of []
[12:59:12] <mikieb> shoky_: Awesoem thanks. My first go a javascript. Nice to know its an easy fix.
[13:07:39] <morfin> hello
[13:08:56] <morfin> stuff in (function ( $ ) {})(jQuery); is in closure so not avaliable from outside?>
[13:11:53] <codemonkee> morfin: correct
[13:12:23] <codemonkee> unless you make something global, i.e. (function($){ var foo = 'bar'; window.foo = foo; }(jQuery);
[13:13:10] <codemonkee> You could also do like so:  var foo;  (function(foo, $){ foo = 'bar'; }(foo, jQuery);
[13:13:31] <jacobroufa> @morfin: check out this blog post for more information on that pattern: http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[13:15:06] <codemonkee> So I'm getting really close to figuring out my issue -- anyone have any experience with extending $.fn with custom namespacing? This solution worked: http://stackoverflow.com/a/4480218  but requires me to invoke like so: var foo = $(selector).namespace(); foo.namespace.method(); OR simply $(selector).namespace().namespace.method(); and I'm not sure how to make it so I can just go $(selector).namespace.method()
[13:17:08] <jacobroufa> @codemonkee you cant just return an object from `namespace` rather than a function or `this`?
[13:17:31] <cableguy> hello
[13:17:42] <cableguy> my script runs on jsfiddle, but not on live .html page
[13:17:44] <cableguy> https://jsfiddle.net/ryXFt/704/
[13:18:35] <cableguy> when clicked console gives 'TypeError: $(...).offset(...) is null' for line 3 which contains 'scrollTop: $(".second").offset().top},'
[13:18:50] <cableguy> but it works on jsfiddle
[13:20:58] <codemonkee> jacobroufa: not sure where you're referring to
[13:25:19] <shoky_> cableguy: sounds like in your live page there is no .second element in the DOM at the time of that call
[13:25:36] <cableguy> oh sorry, I updated that .second to a working class
[13:25:39] <cableguy> but still nothing
[13:25:45] <shoky_> nothing?
[13:26:27] <cableguy> i mean its not working
[13:26:30] <cableguy> and getting same error
[13:26:53] <altroway> is there anyone that can help me with a mapael problem?
[13:27:06] <shoky_> cableguy: then it still sounds like what i said ;p
[13:27:37] <cableguy> it's right there i'm looking at it
[13:27:52] <shoky_> console.log( $(".second").length )
[13:29:42] <cableguy> what that supposed to do
[13:30:31] <shoky_> cableguy: put that at the same place in the code, it'll tell you if that element exists in the dom or not. i.e. if it makes sense to call .offset() on it or not
[13:31:15] <shoky_> or.. link to your live page/testcase
[13:31:38] <cableguy> you mean paste it in right before scrollTop: $(".region-front-calander").offset().top},
[13:32:00] <shoky_> before the animate call
[13:33:27] <cableguy> well when clicked now, it gives same error message but this time it spams it with every click
[13:33:49] <shoky_> hm?
[13:34:22] <cableguy> i'm sorry i'm newbie. i did what you said
[13:34:39] <cableguy> pasted it before $('html,body').animate({ and refreshed the page
[13:34:40] <shoky_> show your updated code
[13:34:51] <shoky_> and it doesn't log a number?
[13:34:59] <shoky_> to the js console
[13:35:09] <cableguy> 0
[13:35:19] <shoky_> so the element does not exist in the DOM at that time
[13:35:22] <shoky_> is your selector right?
[13:35:26] <shoky_> calander? calendar?
[13:35:30] <cableguy> yes
[13:35:38] <cableguy> so what does it mean, why it does not exist
[13:35:55] <shoky_> i have no way of knowing without seeing
[13:36:11] <cableguy> http://www.gatewaypreschool1.com/
[13:36:12] <shoky_> either your selector is wrong, or the element is not YET in the dom
[13:36:15] <shoky_> or it was removed
[13:37:34] <shoky_> cableguy: like i said, your selector is wrong
[13:37:39] <shoky_> cableguy: it's calendar, not calander
[13:41:06] <cableguy> so I guess it means i'm just retarded
[13:41:16] <shoky_> lol
[13:42:03] <cableguy> thanks for help it works now
[13:42:12] <shoky_> np
[14:16:42] <dan_j> Hi. Is there a way to perform an animation on a group of DIVs (with the same class), one DIV at a time, with a 5 second gap between each one?
[14:30:57] <shoky_> dan_j this is one way  http://jsfiddle.net/0h2nodsy/
[14:32:32] <dan_j> Is it possible to do without using callback... IE. To start animation on subsequent DIVs before the earlier DIVs are done?
[14:37:18] <dan_j> It's ok. I think I get it. Thanks for your help.
[14:55:44] <nido_> is this the right place to ask noobish/basic javascript/jquery questions?
[14:55:50] <robertmaxrees> yep!
[14:57:08] <nido_> thank you. What I need to know right now is this: (function($) { $.fn.planningBoard = function(orgId, firstDate, locale) { //lotsacrap };})(jQuery); //where would i start to look for 'function(orgId, firstDate, locale)''s input?
[14:57:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:58:05] <robertmaxrees> that's making a jquery plugin.
[14:58:12] <nido_> $.fn.planningBoard is probbly something custom but the structure lead me to believe it is jquery. I was hoping there would be an easy way to divine how this gets executed
[14:58:28] <robertmaxrees> it's added to $.fn
[14:58:40] <robertmaxrees> so you can do $('someSelector').planningBoard();
[15:01:47] <nido_> thank you. You are indeed correct
[15:22:51] <skinux> Could someone give me an example for simplest form a JSON request to pull data from server?
[15:22:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:23:38] <skinux> I'd like an example of the simplest way to do $.ajax(...) using JSON to get tabular data from server.
[15:23:50] <robertmaxrees> posting using ajax you mean?
[15:24:34] <skinux> Yes. I want to send request for data using JSON format and receive data back in JSON format as well.
[15:25:32] <skinux> I couldn't find an actual example for it on jquery.com
[15:26:00] <robertmaxrees> the server defines the format that gets returned.
[15:26:15] <robertmaxrees> and you just populate the data property.
[15:27:43] <skinux> Okay. Well, I need a simple example for sending a JSON request for the data.
[15:28:05] <robertmaxrees> okay - what have you tried?
[15:28:16] <skinux> AJAX request using JSON as format for sending request data
[15:28:22] <robertmaxrees> do it.
[15:28:25] <robertmaxrees> like - show me :)
[15:28:40] <skinux> Here's what I have so far: $.ajax([
[15:28:40] <skinux>     	        url: '/api/applications/',
[15:28:40] <skinux>     	        async: false
[15:28:40] <skinux>     	]);
[15:28:52] <robertmaxrees> please don't paste in the channel btw :)
[15:28:57] <robertmaxrees> and don't use async: false
[15:28:59] <skinux> It was only four lines
[15:29:03] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter :)
[15:29:33] <robertmaxrees> spams the channel - and you just need to add the data property and the method property
[15:32:20] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/58bd3a155c03
[15:32:24] <robertmaxrees> this is the basic gist.
[15:36:35] <ashgotti> Evening. I need a bit of help with jquery and ajax. I'm using drupal, which has a field collection module where I can add multiple instances of that field collection using ajax. I have a button that triggers adding an instance of that field collection. Now, I don't know what selector to use for the new instances of the field.
[15:39:56] <ashgotti> Basically how to select fields added with ajax.
[15:48:37] <jak2000> re = /^\d+$/g;    <--- this regexp accept 0?
[15:49:28] <shoky_> js> print( /^\d+$/g.test('0') )
[15:49:32] <b-ot> shoky_: true
[15:50:39] <shoky_> ashgotti: same as selecting fields not added with ajax
[15:51:37] <ashgotti> shoky_: I think I figured it out. The problem was I have Field A and a button adds Field B and I needed to populate Field B. I used ajaxComplete and last()
[15:52:50] <jak2000> shoky_: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/2nzvx0p6/6/
[16:07:44] <shoky_> jak2000: don't use alert. and look at your console
[16:41:20] <justjosh123> hey guys, was wondering if someone has experience with “datatables” and can tell me what I’m doing wrong. In this example, datatables won’t initialize if I have a header row; but without the header row, I don’t have any headers! TIA  http://jsbin.com/dayace/edit?html,output
[16:43:47] <robertmaxrees> it's initializing, but not displaying data on load fwiw.
[16:45:16] <justjosh123> robertmaxrees: well i guess that’s something :)
[16:47:01] <robertmaxrees> i'd hit up their forums.
[16:47:38] <justjosh123> i’m evaluating, so if there’s a better option I’d be willing to take that, too
[16:47:48] <robertmaxrees> no clue.
[17:39:48] <yashinbasement> what's the drop: mean in
[17:39:51] <yashinbasement>  $( "#droppable" ).droppable({
[17:39:51] <yashinbasement>       drop: function( event, ui ) {
[17:39:51] <yashinbasement>         $( this )
[17:39:51] <yashinbasement>           .addClass( "ui-state-highlight" )
[17:39:51] <yashinbasement>           .find( "p" )
[17:39:51] <yashinbasement>             .html( "Dropped!" );
[17:39:53] <yashinbasement>       }
[17:39:55] <yashinbasement>     });
[17:43:44] <shoky_> yashinbasement: don't paste multiline code in the channel. and, it's this  http://api.jqueryui.com/droppable/#event-drop
[17:45:19] <yashinbasement> thanks, yep I won't pase again
[18:42:15] <DjinnASD> regarding jquery mobile: how do i refresh a page when i click a link to that #page, if it makes sense
[21:00:28] <Jeffp> i have code that changes my label color when clicked using remove and add class , however I cant figure out how to get it back if its clicked again

[21:09:27] <ISmithers> Has anyone here had an issue with jquery carousel causing a page jump when the slide transitions?
[22:26:59] <tash> is there a pretty straight forward way to convert 12:00 AM to 00:00:00 ?
[22:35:13] <rcyr> moment.js perhaps
[22:43:14] <mdev> not just moment regular

[22:50:23] <dsdeiz> hey all is it possible to select an li element from  the 10th index to the last?
[22:51:11] <Abhijit> hi
[22:51:30] <Abhijit> i did $(".container").remove() and i the contair div is still there in my page source?
[22:53:13] <Abhijit> however the container div and its contents are not visible on the page.
[22:53:22] <Abhijit> but how can I also remove it from the source also?
[22:53:38] <rcyr> Abhijit: The "source" is not the live representation of the page...
[22:54:50] <Abhijit> rcyr, ok. but I want to hide it from user completele? hence how can I remove it from source also?
[22:55:05] <mdev> can empty its html
[22:55:15] <mdev> not sure if that'll replace in source
[22:55:25] <Abhijit> ok. will try. thanks.
[22:55:44] <mdev> can try empty() too and html("");
[22:56:04] <Abhijit> ok
[23:01:03] <fattest> how do i get the position of my scroll, ie if is scrolled all the way down, it should be 100% http://jsfiddle.net/PGuB5/799/
[23:13:07] <Cork> fattest: (1 - (.scrollHeight - .scrollTop)) * 100
[23:15:21] <fattest> Cork: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/PGuB5/802/
[23:19:28] <Cork> hmm, weird
[23:19:34] <Cork> your scrollHeight isn't correct
[23:19:35] <Cork> not sure why
[23:23:43] <Cork> fattest: http://jsfiddle.net/PGuB5/803/
[23:25:25] <fattest> Cork thank you very much!!
[23:43:31] <peter___> hy what is wrong here that time is not clocking? https://jsfiddle.net/mgdL9wq8/
[23:45:21] <Cork> peter___: you only check the date once
[23:45:45] <Cork> uh
[23:45:57] <Cork> and actually you never check the difference
[23:46:15] <peter___> how would i check difference?
[23:46:30] <Cork> first of what exactly are you trying to do?
[23:46:45] <Cork> calculate the time left until 1:23:45?
[23:47:52] <peter___> no every second i would like to update current time
[23:48:05] <Cork> so you just want to show the current time?
[23:48:12] <peter___> true
[23:48:35] <peter___> setinverval should overwrite current time with seccond +1
[23:48:40] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/mgdL9wq8/3/
[23:49:09] <peter___> okey, but what if i my time?
[23:49:21] <Cork> if your time what?
[23:49:34] <peter___> i set firstly my time, and thanit counts seoncds on my definded time
[23:49:43] <Cork> no
[23:49:47] <Cork> it doesn't work like that
[23:49:54] <Cork> date gives you your local time
[23:50:02] <peter___> yeah know, but i would like that it works like that..
[23:50:16] <Cork> if you want to display a different time you have to modify the time with how far of it should be
[23:50:17] <peter___> first i defind time, and it counts on my definded time
[23:50:36] <ryanneufeld> Are you saying you want to setInterval() to happen on certain dates?
[23:51:00] <Cork> for that to work you have to 1. grab the current time, 2. calculate how far of it is from "your time"
[23:51:07] <Cork> 3. store the difference
[23:51:23] <Cork> 4. for each interval take the current time and modify it with the difference
[23:51:43] <ryanneufeld> never mind that setInterval is bad
[23:51:52] <ryanneufeld> and unreliable
[23:54:45] <peter___> i only like that counts up from that definded time
[23:56:33] <Cork> ryanneufeld: for a simple time display it doesn't need to be more precise then that
[23:57:05] <Cork> though ya, a setTimeout + a requestAnimationFrame would be better
