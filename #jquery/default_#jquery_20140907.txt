[00:49:57] <VectorX> how do i do something like jQuery("#from[]")
[00:50:24] <VectorX> basically i got multiple input boxes with name="from[]'
[00:50:25] <VectorX> basically i got multiple input boxes with name="from[]"
[00:58:44] <montag> VectorX try $('[name="from[]"]')
[01:00:05] <VectorX> ok looks like that took
[01:02:00] <montag> # is for matching id and you shouldn't have multiple elements with the same id
[01:03:34] <VectorX> yup
[01:05:12] <VectorX> ok so now i got this jQuery('[name="from[]"]').autocomplete({   which is fine coz i have a field already on the page, but i am also inserting some fields into the div "#input_fields_wrap" with a button, how can i get those fields to get the autocomplete, <input type="text" name="from[]"> thats whats being added to the div
[01:13:45] <montag> i think you want .val() not .autocomplete()
[01:16:27] <VectorX> montag im using http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[01:16:36] <montag> ah, ok
[01:16:44] <VectorX> the new fields im adding are not getting the listener
[01:17:56] <montag> are you calling .autocomplete() after adding the buttons
[01:18:03] <montag> *fields
[01:21:13] <VectorX> well i got jQuery('[name="from[]"]').autocomplete({  which works fine with  the field that is on the page when its loaded, so for multiple locations im adding the extra <input type="text" name="from[]"> on button click, but they dont seem to get the autocomplete function when i type in them
[01:22:34] <montag> you have to call .autocomplete on the new fields
[01:24:19] <VectorX> how do i do tht
[01:28:55] <montag> like $(...new field...).appendTo('#input_fields_wrap').autocomplete(...)
[01:35:14] <VectorX> montag done deal
[01:39:02] <shahin8r1> Can anyone check if there is a syntax error on this simple ajax function: http://paste.ofcode.org/qtHg79wmj3pREy7mEhiDhS it seems that the function isn't created

[04:47:51] <kamruddin> $( "input" ).each( function( i, el ) {     var elem = $( el );     elem.val( elem.val() + "%" ); });
[04:48:06] <kamruddin> this code  is in http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/iterating/
[04:48:51] <kamruddin> why do we need to do wrapping as $(el) since we are iterating over a collection of jQuery objects
[04:49:12] <kamruddin> Any idea?
[04:49:51] <frank_o> Cork: From StackOverflow
[04:49:58] <frank_o> Cork: "These are typically quite fiddly. Having two animations with variable start begin and ends, can get tricky. Firstly I think some browsers don't handle things like beginElement well (or at all), then you have to figure out what state an animation is in before it starts as well as during and after (especially with freeze)."
[04:50:07] <frank_o> Cork: "I think its a worthwhile experience learning, but if you have a lot of things like this, you may find it better using a library like Raphael/Snap if you get stuck for too long or no one has a solution."
[04:50:52] <frank_o> Cork: I'm usually against adding 3rd party libs here and there but maybe it's the right thing to do in this case?

[07:05:24] <_rgn> |RicharD|: well pretty sure $contaner is not defined because the variable's name is $container

[07:43:46] <jeffreylevesque> could someone tell me how to detect if the browser is either safari, or mobile safari?
[07:48:35] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: You can probably just look for "safari" in the UA string?
[07:48:52] <jeffreylevesque> i was thinking of using http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/
[07:49:46] <BillCriswell> Not sure that'd be able to detect the browser.
[07:50:02] <jeffreylevesque> i need to detect whether the browser supports datalist
[07:50:36] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[07:53:41] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/146 here is how a few others tested for that.
[07:55:13] <BillCriswell> http://demo.agektmr.com/datalist/ damn
[07:55:33] <BillCriswell> I had no idea it could do a bunch of this stuff.
[07:57:30] <frank_o> BillCriswell: isnt that like twitter typeahead.js?
[07:58:03] <frank_o> oh damn, <datalist>? what is *that*
[07:58:23] <BillCriswell> frank_o: some html5 neatness.
[07:58:39] <frank_o> BillCriswell: you always bring the coolest stuff to us man :)
[07:59:01] <BillCriswell> I just find it accidentally usually.
[08:03:13] <BillCriswell> Safari still doesn't support it yet. That's weird.
[08:05:49] <frank_o> yeah =/
[10:43:43] <tejas-manohar> im having jquery problems with meteor
[10:43:49] <tejas-manohar> if someone here has worked with meteor
[10:43:53] <tejas-manohar> enough to understand
[10:43:55] <tejas-manohar> id love help
[10:44:00] <tejas-manohar> but its more jquery most likely
[11:08:16] <Velveeta> tejas-manohar: what kinds of problems?
[11:09:24] <Velveeta> or nevermind i guess
[11:16:02] <adavia> is it bad to put my js in my html page?
[12:35:12] <tejas-manohar> hey jquery'ers
[12:35:17] <tejas-manohar> im dealing with an annoying youtube embed
[12:35:17] <tejas-manohar> http://bpaste.net/show/39b55732e9ad
[12:35:21] <tejas-manohar> ik this method is kinda sucky
[12:35:45] <tejas-manohar> {{selectedUser.profile.embedvideo}} contains something similar to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uALVIcQXH4Q
[12:36:04] <tejas-manohar> and src="" will contain something similar to  "//www.youtube.com/embed/uALVIcQXH4Q
[12:36:45] <tejas-manohar> When the page loads src is at //www.youtube.com/embed/error indicating something didnt work
[12:36:56] <tejas-manohar> but if I run affecting() in my browser's console
[12:37:00] <tejas-manohar> the youtube embed works magically
[12:37:02] <tejas-manohar> why is this?
[12:40:20] <decx> why dont you use the embed api?
[12:41:30] <tejas-manohar> decx: what
[12:41:54] <tejas-manohar> decx: isnt it the same thign really
[12:43:41] <decx> how so
[12:45:26] <tejas-manohar> decx: i mean what advantage does it give here?
[12:45:40] <decx> the advantage is that you dont need all that shit
[12:45:49] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/t8phrg1y/
[12:46:46] <tejas-manohar> decx: lemme try that lol
[12:50:49] <tejas-manohar> decx: whats some random tag that i can use that is likely not used anywhere else
[12:50:56] <tejas-manohar> so i can just use .each on that lol
[12:51:18] <tejas-manohar> decx: is it legal to make up a tag and grab that made-up one from jquery
[12:51:26] <decx> no
[12:51:26] <tejas-manohar> so like <lolol> $('lolol')
[12:51:28] <tejas-manohar> oh
[12:51:29] <tejas-manohar> lol
[12:51:32] <decx> just use a class
[12:51:38] <tejas-manohar> decx: alrighty

[12:59:39] <Prometheian> I have a page in my app that I'm trying to open in a lightbox. Just a url going to a page. The page does have an ajax call in it. I can't seem to find a good plugin that will lightbox a page for me. :/
[13:00:14] <decx> lightbox is a 2008 word, search for modal
[13:01:36] <Prometheian> This will probably make my life easier
[13:04:06] <tejas-manohar> decx: your solution is much better :)
[13:04:29] <tejas-manohar> decx: but how do u get away without a semicolon after var videos = $('.videoemb')
[13:04:44] <Prometheian> Javascript isn't bitchy about ;
[13:05:18] <tejas-manohar> Promethian: niiice
[13:05:28] <Prometheian> ?
[13:06:54] <Prometheian> decx: I can just use bootstrap's modal to lightbox things?
[13:08:22] <decx> you can use whatever
[13:08:51] <Prometheian> Well my app already has bootstrap in it (mvc 5 template thing) so was just wondering if solid option
[13:09:11] <decx> well then it would be foolish not to i'd say
[13:10:05] <tejas-manohar> decx: does this seem reasonable -- http://bpaste.net/show/d027c480d3b8
[13:15:46] <tejas-manohar> decx: whats wrong with this http://bpaste.net/show/243787e1d958
[13:15:55] <tejas-manohar> decx: its not working
[13:16:04] <tejas-manohar> also says "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier"
[13:16:22] <tejas-manohar> decx: the first div's text is showing in the html though - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uALVIcQXH4Q

[13:35:09] <Prometheian> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getscript/
[13:35:43] <tejas-manohar> Promethian: yeah like an equivalent of a <script> tag?
[13:35:47] <tejas-manohar> is that an equivalent of a script tag
[13:36:10] <Prometheian> Yeah
[13:36:16] <Prometheian> But a script tag is better
[13:36:29] <tejas-manohar> Promethian: apparently my script tag isnt working or somethign lol
[13:36:34] <Prometheian> paste it?
[13:36:34] <tejas-manohar> idk why the yt thing doesnt work locally

[17:16:52] <Peter_Occ> It will take me a while
[17:19:55] <beancurd> Peter_Occ: some rouge css !important somewhere.
[17:20:26] <beancurd> pull up your inspector and see what's happening to the element.
[17:20:37] <Peter_Occ> You mean for display? or something else?
[17:21:24] <beancurd> height, display, whatevs.
[17:22:02] <beancurd> try fadeOut instead of slideUp, see if that does anything.
[17:22:10] <beancurd> but yeah, inspector will tell you what's up.
[17:24:08] <Peter_Occ> Could it be because its display: table-row;
[17:24:10] <Peter_Occ> }
[17:47:40] <adavia> is it bad to put my js in my html?

[17:50:51] <systemfault> adavia: What do you mean? Do you have an example?
[17:52:39] <adavia> systemfault:  lets say i have this url /user/2/ i found a way passing the id using a hidden field in my html but instead is easy just using my backend for the url in the same html

[17:59:45] <systemfault> adavia: To better show me what you mean
[18:03:40] <adavia> systemfault: ok.. but what if you dont have nothing in action?
[18:04:01] <systemfault> Write the url in the .js file... I guess

[19:29:02] <BryanJQ> (whistle)
[19:29:51] <systemfault> Sure.
[19:31:27] <BryanJQ> After I click the link, It will redirect then click a button on the redirected page, Is it possible on jquery?
[19:33:27] <BryanJQ> For example, onlick go to google.com, when you are already on google.com it will click the I'm feeling lucky button @systemfault
[19:34:57] <BryanJQ> Anybody here?
[19:35:01] <BryanJQ> Anybody here?\
[19:35:03] <BryanJQ> Anybody here?\
[19:35:04] <BryanJQ> Anybody here?\
[19:52:26] <shoky> BillCriswell: nope, just skimmed through the guide i think
[19:53:07] <BillCriswell> shoky: I think I'm really digging this one.
[19:56:59] <shoky> seems pretty similar to KO, no complaints from me ;p
[19:58:00] <shoky> glad you're finally enjoying some data-binding/MV* goodness
[19:58:09] <shoky> and, glad it's not angular ;D
[19:58:28] <BillCriswell> shoky: Haha.
[19:58:46] <BillCriswell> Yeah. This is the first one that clicked almost immediately.
[21:41:13] <BclaP> Hello all. I'm having a small issue re-binding events on dynamically created elements. I'm not quite sure if I'm doing this correctly. Code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/tfstvwf9/
[21:43:47] <BclaP> The whole point of what I'm trying to do is this: On the first click of a .mainCategory <li> it calls the ajax request and appends the elements to that <li>. After the ajax call, it should re-bind the <li> to make it toggle the newly created <ul>
[21:44:18] <NinjaBanjo> BclaP, why not just use a delegate?
[21:44:22] <NinjaBanjo> `api delegate
[21:44:22] <b-ot> NinjaBanjo: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[21:44:28] <BclaP> I thought that was deprecated?
[21:44:39] <NinjaBanjo> you can use .on the same way
[21:44:42] <NinjaBanjo> `api on
[21:44:42] <b-ot> NinjaBanjo: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[21:44:50] <BclaP> That's what I do there
[21:45:06] <BclaP> I am just wondering if the code is shit or not, essentially
[21:45:20] <BclaP> oops sorry if cursing is against the rules
[21:45:53] <NinjaBanjo> syntax :$.on('click','ul', function(){})
[21:46:18] <NinjaBanjo> will bind click on all ul of the target in $() before .on
[21:46:27] <BclaP> you obviously didn't read my code
[21:47:14] <BclaP> actually let me ask you another question
[21:47:43] <BclaP> should I delegate the event to the parent element or just bind and event for each element in an .each()?
[21:48:10] <NinjaBanjo> with a large number of elements that dynamically load and unload, use the parent
[21:48:25] <BclaP> this is ~10
[21:48:46] <NinjaBanjo> if they load dynamiclly i still recommand using the parent
[21:49:03] <BclaP> that's what I would like to do also, but I can't seem to re-bind
[21:49:16] <NinjaBanjo> there shouldn't be a rebind, it looks at event bubbling
[21:55:39] <BclaP> see, when I switch the first event bind from .one() to .on(), the code gives UB. This is because it doesn't re-bind from the callback
[21:55:56] <BclaP> why if I am using .on() like you said to use it?
[21:56:17] <BclaP> I know I'm missing something here...

[23:15:21] <oskob> when you get an error like this, how do you trace it back to the script that caused it?
[23:15:24] <oskob> http://pastebin.com/JaRgrdrQ
[23:17:47] <Cork> oskob: 1. load a version of jquery that isn't minified
[23:17:54] <Cork> 2. put a breakpoint on the error
[23:17:59] <Cork> when the error hits
[23:18:10] <Cork> use the step out debugger option
[23:18:16] <oskob> ah, thanks
