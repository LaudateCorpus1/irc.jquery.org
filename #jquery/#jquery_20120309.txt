[00:00:52] <Cork> raj: that creates the widget $.blueimp.fileupload and inherits the values from $.bluimg
[00:00:55] <Cork> uh..
[00:01:09] <Cork> $.bluimp.fileupload
[00:01:25] <Cork> raj: so its basically extending the widget
[00:01:37] <raj> Cork, then why isn't it mentioned anywhere in the docs that that line needs to exist?
[00:02:00] <softmanpetro> how to get  document location
[00:02:12] <AdvoWork> Cork, yeah they're both perfectly fine
[00:02:13] <Cork> softmanpetro: window.location
[00:02:30] <Cork> AdvoWork: fine? are they the same?
[00:02:38] <Cork> else its cross domain and thats blocked
[00:02:47] <AdvoWork> Cork, if i copy the link that url gives, it works and yeah its on my local domain
[00:03:08] <Cork> http(s)://(domain|port):port/ has to be identical or its closs domain
[00:03:24] <Cork> (domain|ipaddress)
[00:04:01] <Cork> AdvoWork: simplest way around that is to just use relative urls
[00:04:17] <Cork> url = "/index.php?section=Purchasing&action=raise_po"
[00:05:35] <AdvoWork> Cork, Just tried that now: var url = "/myapp/index.php?section=Purchasing&action=raise_po";  but,  same problem. If i look in firebug, and look at the get response, the code for that page is in there, but its just not showing it
[00:05:59] <Cork> does the error event trigger?
[00:06:54] <raj> Cork, the code for the plugin does that line itself https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/jquery.fileupload.js#L38
[00:07:03] <raj> so I shouldn't need to do it as I am, correct?
[00:07:55] <raj> I just wanna replace these defaults really
[00:08:05] <raj> in my custom script file
[00:08:13] <raj> what's the proper way to do that?
[00:08:27] <raj> (call the plugin with different options)
[00:08:32] <dgx> Can I use .remove() to delte an element only, without its content?
[00:09:09] <Cork> raj: your extending its options
[00:09:28] <Cork> the dropZone changes you make won't happen if you remove that code
[00:09:53] <raj> Cork, https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Drop-zone-effects
[00:10:17] <raj> http://paste.ofcode.org/x9NBaNGKpLssEHQt8LbTti
[00:10:21] <raj> that's my code
[00:10:45] <raj> so I thought I could just put the dropzone changes within the function in line 10
[00:12:18] <AdvoWork> Cork, i think its ok now, but i dont know whats different, the problem now is, i was using load() to put the page into a div, now im using that, but its changed the layout. With load, it came in and was styled correctly, with a margin for example, but now its come in and half of the content is missing on the left side. Do you know what could cause that? No css has changed, just how i'm loading the content into the div
[00:14:38] <AdvoWork> and also, my understanding was $('#column').replaceWith(data);   would actually replace the column div with that data, but once ran that once, and call the function again, the previous information/data stays there and is not replaed with it again like I would expect?
[00:16:56] <raj> Cork, am I wrong?
[00:17:55] <Cork> raj: depends on if your allowed to change that there
[00:17:58] <Cork> but basically, ya
[00:18:19] <Cork> AdvoWork: yes replaceWith is meant to replaces the selected element with the new content
[00:21:19] <AdvoWork> Cork, can you think of any reason why it wouldnt? basically my content is loaded there fine from what I can tell(i can see it) I perform an auto complete which puts other data on the page; also fine. I reclick the hyperlink which successfully calls the replaceWith function again, but the content isn't replaced. Any ideas?
[00:22:09] <Cork> AdvoWork: only think i can think of is duplicate id's or your using a cache variable pointing to the old element
[00:22:17] <Cork> *only thing
[00:23:38] <AdvoWork> Cork, hmm, i do: alert("num of column ids:" + $('#column').length);    the first time it shows 1, the 2nd time, it shows 0. Hows that possible? I do this just before I do $('#column').replaceWith(data);
[00:24:36] <Cork> alert("num of column ids:" + $('[id="column"]').length);
[00:24:47] <Cork> #<id> only ever returns one element
[00:25:06] <Cork> id can namly only exist once in a valid document
[00:25:23] <AdvoWork> Cork, ran yours, first time it said 1, second time it said 0
[00:25:44] <Cork> so the new element doesn't have the id tag
[00:26:48] <AdvoWork> but if the column div, is literally just <div id="column" class="non_printable" style="border:1px solid #000000;"></div>  how can it not? why would it be removing it's id?
[00:27:08] <Cork> AdvoWork: inspect the generated dom
[00:27:26] <Cork> it will give you the answers instead of guessing
[00:27:58] <AdvoWork> i've been trying, im trying to view the generate source, or do you mean just inspect the element in chrome for example?
[00:28:10] <Cork> yes
[00:28:23] <Cork> development tools > element > inspect
[00:30:22] <AdvoWork> Cork, ive done that, looked at the html element, copied the whole thing into a notepad to view it, and column isn't there once it has been replaceWidth the first time
[00:30:48] <Cork> AdvoWork: uh... copied?
[00:30:59] <Cork> you should have a dom view in the tab
[00:31:10] <Cork> just look around to find the parent your looking for
[00:32:29] <AdvoWork> I do, when i load the page, i can see the column div. when i click the hyperlink which calls the function to replaceWith it loads the content, but then i look at the dom again, and the div with id column has gone
[00:32:54] <Cork> and what has taken its place?
[00:33:28] <Cork> might be your for example doing something like $('#somid').replaceWith($('#someid', data).html())
[00:33:43] <Cork> that would remove the element #someid and replace it with its children
[00:35:49] <AdvoWork> in the page im replacing with, at the top of that i've put TEST.  repeated the steps, and i view it, i can see TEST, but its not surrounded by the column div anymore, it just seems to have added on where the div was previously if that makes sense?
[00:40:43] <AdvoWork> Cork, i do: STARTCOL<div id="column" class="non_printable" style="border:1px solid #000000;"></div>ENDCOL  and then, once i replace with, its left with: STARTCOL TOP OF RAISEPO // html etc
[00:41:57] <AdvoWork> so its replacing, but totally removing the initial div
[00:42:43] <nocturne7> How can I change all "Edit"s to "View" here http://pastie.org/3554241
[00:43:03] <nocturne7> this did not help $("li:contains('Edit')").text("View");
[00:45:04] <softmanpetro> when i do 'text ' + imgtag[0] is ObjectHtmlElement
[00:45:21] <softmanpetro> I mean text ObjectHtmlElement
[00:45:37] <softmanpetro> but I would like th econtent of that ObjectHTML
[00:46:38] <softmanpetro> nvm
[00:46:46] <softmanpetro> I was children instead of html
[00:56:59] <Gaia> Hey guys
[00:57:18] <Gaia> Im looking for a simple autocompleter to autocomplete values from my database
[00:57:37] <Cork> ?g jquery-ui autocomplete
[00:57:44] <bot-t> Cork, jQuery UI - Autocomplete Demos & Documentation - http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[00:58:01] <Gaia> yeah i found that one
[00:58:14] <Gaia> But.....those skins suck :<
[00:58:20] <Gaia> i just want it to be plain white
[00:58:28] <Gaia> not some color or gradient
[00:58:33] <Cork> so don't use its css then
[00:58:42] <Gaia> its all in its css? :O
[00:58:48] <Cork> yes
[00:58:51] <Gaia> sweet
[00:58:53] <Gaia> thnx alot
[01:06:14] <s0u][ight> hi guys, http://jsfiddle.net/BsHk7/ a dblclick event triggers a ball to be created and dropped to the bottom of the page, a click on this ball should remove it, but that is failing, can someone explain me what i'm doing wrong?
[01:08:21] <maodun> $.post('/foo/77') is making a GET request - why would that possibly be?
[01:08:37] <softmanpetro> how to change from a html text the class="hide" with class="inline" ?
[01:08:40] <maodun> this is in both chrome and firefox
[01:09:10] <Cork> maodun: only guessing, but might be your not providing any data?
[01:09:23] <maodun> same thing when I provide data
[01:09:35] <Cork> donno then
[01:09:43] <maodun> $.post('/raw_material_inspections/77', {foo: 1})
[01:09:47] <Cork> never experiensed it
[01:10:14] <Cork> softmanpetro: parsing error on line 1 ;), could you refrace that?
[01:10:20] <maodun> oddly, when I change the url name by adding or removing a character, it posts correctly
[01:10:32] <jrockjiggz> s0u][ight: something to work with http://jsfiddle.net/BsHk7/1/
[01:10:34] <Bacta> What's the difference between writing a jQuery plugin and a jQueryUI plugin?
[01:10:39] <Cork> maodun: where do you see it as a get request?
[01:10:46] <maodun> $.post('/raw_material_inspection/77') for example works
[01:10:47] <Cork> in the browser?
[01:10:52] <AdvoWork> Cork, do you know the reason for this: im loading that page (html and js on page) into that div, which is kinda working ok now, but say on the new page i have a click handler which does alert()  the first time it loads, it says alert, if i click the link again, it replaceWith the code, but the JS must be loaded again as the alert fires twice, any ideas?
[01:10:53] <maodun> Cork: both on the server and in the browsers
[01:11:04] <maodun> I've also tried changing my jquery version to the latest version
[01:11:08] <maodun> the latest stable version
[01:11:10] <maodun> same issue
[01:11:47] <maodun> I am truly at a loss
[01:11:48] <Cork> AdvoWork: the dom elements are replaces so your events are most likly removed
[01:11:57] <Cork> maodun: do you have a link?
[01:12:08] <maodun> $.post('/ra_material_inspections/77') will also work
[01:12:17] <maodun> Cork: sorry but no, this is an internal app
[01:12:30] <AdvoWork> Cork, but if i click the hyperlink 3 times(so replace with has been ran 3 times) then when i call the click handler, it runs 3 times
[01:12:32] <softmanpetro> need to replace class="hide" with class="inline" Cork
[01:12:38] <Cork> maodun: thats not relevant to jquery it doens't got a *** about what the url is
[01:12:41] <softmanpetro> from a html text
[01:12:43] <AdvoWork> its like the code has been read into the dom 3 times?
[01:12:46] <s0u][ight> jrockjiggz: thanks for structuring the code, do you see what's wrong with those last pieces of jquery code?
[01:13:06] <maodun> Cork: I understand that, thus I am very perplexed
[01:13:20] <Cork> softmanpetro: $('.inline').removeClass('inline').addClass('hide')
[01:13:27] <maodun> I feel like there must be some kind of low-level bug
[01:13:38] <Cork> maodun: its 99.9% garanteed a codeing error or a server error
[01:13:41] <softmanpetro> that will modify the element but I need just the html modified
[01:13:51] <Cork> but can't say without seeing it in action
[01:14:14] <maodun> Cork: it can't really be a server error unless I somehow accidentally modified the jquery library...
[01:14:36] <jrockjiggz> s0u][ight: fixed: http://jsfiddle.net/BsHk7/2/   -- the problem is because the element .dblclick doesn't exist when the dom is ready, use live()
[01:15:28] <softmanpetro> NVM DID IT WITH REPLACE
[01:16:13] <s0u][ight> jrockjiggz: you just taught me a new thing, thanks for the live() tip!
[01:16:21] <Cork> softmanpetro: just the html modified??
[01:16:33] <softmanpetro> yes is fine now thx
[01:16:43] <softmanpetro> imgtag = imgtag.replace('class="hide"','class="inline"');
[01:16:51] <Cork> ...
[01:16:53] <Cork> but why?
[01:17:23] <softmanpetro> I use it in a html constructed string to adapt fb title with callback function
[01:17:32] <Cork> imgtag = $(imgtag).find('.inline').removeClass('inline').addClass('hide') ?
[01:21:54] <AdvoWork> how can you ensure you don't get duplicated code? am i right in thinking that if a page needs a click handler, if i put that hanlder in a .js file linked from the main page, no matter how many times I load the sub page(that needs to access it, it will work) ?
[01:23:03] <Cork> yes
[01:23:45] <Cork> if you load js inside the fragment your loading, you need to clear the old listner that binds outside the elements you replace
[01:25:19] <AdvoWork> do you still need to do that anyway? even if the listener is on an external.js file? meaning if main.html links to external.js but I use load() to put test.html onto that main page (that has a call to the click element), do i still need to clear the old listener? if i re load() ?
[01:26:00] <Cork> .load(url) doesn't trigger ready or load no
[01:26:42] <Whirl3dOrd3r> Cork, could you help me with some logic? I am capturing the hashchange event and parsing the hash to serve as  my basic navigation for my site. But I am having difficulty deciding how to handle showing nested elements when requested..
[01:27:05] <AdvoWork> I don't get what you mean sorry? My problem was, the sub pages im loading into the main page contain .js code, so each time I load() without refreshing, its loading multiple occurences of the handlers or so it seems, so if i click the hyperlink which calls load 5 times, if i run a click handler it runs 5 times, get me?
[01:27:43] <Whirl3dOrd3r> sounds like a good time to use .on
[01:27:43] <Cork> AdvoWork: yes, thats expect
[01:27:48] <Cork> cause the js is parsed multible times
[01:28:02] <AdvoWork> so how do i fix/solve this issue?
[01:28:08] <s0u][ight> jrockjiggz: how would i select all .dblclick elements that are not in the process of an animation?
[01:28:13] <AdvoWork> as this is where i am unfortunately at
[01:28:18] <Cork> AdvoWork: what element are you binding?
[01:28:40] <Whirl3dOrd3r> $(".dblclick").not(":animated");
[01:28:54] <Cork> AdvoWork: things that you can bind once, for every fragment, load that when the page loads
[01:28:54] <s0u][ight> Whirl3dOrd3r: thanks!
[01:29:01] <Whirl3dOrd3r> I'd check the :animated selector, it might be :animating
[01:29:22] <Cork> AdvoWork: things that need to change with each fragment change load it inline
[01:29:22] <s0u][ight> it's animated
[01:29:40] <AdvoWork> Cork, i've got a few things, for example $(document).delegate(".add_product_to_po", "click", function(e) {  which does stuff, and finally when it's finished runs $( this ).dialog( "close" ); which the first time the page is loaded works fine, the 2nd time etc, it does stuff, but doesn't close
[01:29:55] <Whirl3dOrd3r> pfew. Thanks sOu][ight.
[01:30:13] <s0u][ight> :D
[01:30:17] <AdvoWork> Cork, does moving them(the js code) out of the sub pages onto an external js linked always and only from the mian page fix this or not?
[01:30:19] <Cork> AdvoWork: as it binds on document you should do that once
[01:30:34] <Cork> AdvoWork: yes
[01:30:44] <Cork> or do the bind on the id you replace
[01:31:03] <Cork> and it should be removed when you load the new fragment
[01:32:14] <s0u][ight> $(".dblclick").not(":animated").live('mouseenter', function() {});  <= looks wrong to me :/
[01:32:46] <AdvoWork> Cork, but the bind is being called on elements that are generated on the sub page, and the code originally just sat on there and waited for it to be called. i'm loading the page again, and i was expecting it to replace everything, so the id's are always going to be the same, but appears to be duplicated?
[01:32:46] <Whirl3dOrd3r> mostly because .live is bad mojo, I think. LOL
[01:33:25] <jita> I create the links inside the qtip2 tooltip; now i want to bind event to the elements in the tooltip. Can i do that ? if i bind using $('#filter-results').on("click", ".flagset", function(event) {
[01:33:27] <jita> doesnt work
[01:33:28] <caniuse> doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[01:33:29] <Cork> AdvoWork: your mixing things togeather
[01:33:39] <Cork> AdvoWork: js doens't care about the script tag
[01:33:58] <Cork> AdvoWork: when its loaded its loaded, if something referes to the data its live
[01:34:12] <Cork> AdvoWork: the delegate binds the event to document
[01:34:16] <s0u][ight> Whirl3dOrd3r:  $(".dblclick:not(:animated)").live worls :) ^
[01:34:25] <Cork> AdvoWork: that means the event won't be removed until you replace the document element
[01:34:30] <Cork> (aka a reload)
[01:35:04] <Cork> AdvoWork: if you instead of document bind it on the outer most parent that will be replaced on fragment load the event will be removed when you load the new fragment
[01:35:16] <Whirl3dOrd3r> sOu][ight, if you can use jq1.7+, you should exchange .live for .on and refactor. It's faster, better, less code...
[01:35:32] <AdvoWork> in which case, how come its duplicating the event, am i right in thinking that each time i click the load, its loading a new instance of the click handler, hence why it fires multiple times, is that bit right first off?
[01:35:39] <Cork> AdvoWork: but like i said, yes you can load it once for the page load, and not do it again, if teh code doesn't change
[01:36:04] <Cork> AdvoWork: case your binding it to an element your not removing
[01:36:14] <tocka> Hey guys, I wanted to ask
[01:36:24] <Cork> AdvoWork: $(document).delegate(
[01:36:33] <tocka> How to stop form frop refreshing, when i post the data through jQuery, it refreshes
[01:36:36] <tocka> how to stop that?
[01:36:55] <Cork> ?.preventDefault @ tocka
[01:36:56] <bot-t> tocka, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[01:37:55] <AdvoWork> Cork, so how do i stop it loading again? it doesn't change if you get me, the sub page is exactly the same, just like a new instance of it, so the jquery code should act exactly the same, does that make sense?
[01:38:12] <thiessenp> I have limited experience working iFrames and a bit stuck adding a click handler to a DIV with a nested iFrame that contains a banner.
[01:38:33] <thiessenp> I'd like to track the click on the iframe (google analytics) and then trigger the iframe container with a click
[01:38:52] <Mosselmaniac> hi all
[01:39:02] <thiessenp> Oi, any way I bind a click handler to the DIV container it seams to be ignored. Any ideas?
[01:39:17] <Mosselmaniac> i'm using the awesome validation plugin, but i have a question about for example: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Methods/range
[01:39:31] <thiessenp> eg. $('#banner').bind('click', function(e) { do something });
[01:39:33] <Cork> AdvoWork: like i've said over and over again; 1. bind it on the outermost parent you DO replace instead of docuemnt; or 2. load it when the page loads not not again (though this method only works if the code doesn't change)
[01:39:55] <Cork> *loads and not again
[01:40:15] <Mosselmaniac> you there define for example: range: [13, 23] to validate if a number is between 13 and 23. However, i don't want that on class level, i want that on individual field level. these numbers for me are dynamically generated at server side.
[01:40:21] <Cork> thiessenp: that should work just fine
[01:40:26] <Mosselmaniac> how should i do that?
[01:40:57] <thiessenp> Cork: hmm ok, guess I'll have to go for some sort of a crazy hack then :-)
[01:41:15] <thiessenp> Would you guys know a good resource/URL all about iFrames and how events propagate from them etc.?
[01:41:26] <tocka> Cork but the funny thing, it only refreshes when I use $.post, or Im not getting something
[01:41:42] <Cork> thiessenp: events don't propagate from document to document at all
[01:41:58] <thiessenp> oh yah (duh on my part)
[01:42:06] <Cork> thiessenp: if you want to know about events in another document you need to bind the event on that document
[01:42:10] <thiessenp> so I'd have to do message passing
[01:42:15] <AdvoWork> Cork, do you mean instead of document, do it to the #column?  and secondly, how do you load it when the page loads and not again?
[01:42:16] <Cork> no
[01:42:31] <Cork> AdvoWork: for alt.1 yes
[01:42:46] <Cork> AdvoWork: then it would be each time
[01:43:40] <Cork> thiessenp: $('div', iframe.contentDocument) (not sure its contentDocument, always forget its name)
[01:44:27] <Mosselmaniac> Could anybody help me?
[01:44:36] <AdvoWork> Cork, "for alt"?
[01:45:18] <Cork> AdvoWork: the first alternative, where you bind the handlers each time
[01:45:22] <thiessenp> Cork: yup contentDocument - ok so just standard event attaching - cool thanks
[01:46:04] <tocka> This is the code http://jsfiddle.net/kWVmy/ , after i press submit the form refreshes, how to shop that?
[01:46:20] <tocka> And it refreshes only when i use $.post if im not posting everything is ok
[01:46:40] <Whirl3dOrd3r> tocka, e.preventDefault();
[01:46:44] <rrrreimer> is this jquery ok? $('div.spec-result:contains("Your JSON is compliant")').size()
[01:47:01] <AdvoWork> Cork, and if doing: $(".editable_order_line_details").live("click", function() {  what would that become then? i'm not binding that to the document so i don't get what you mean
[01:47:15] <Cork> AdvoWork: live always binds on the docuemnt
[01:47:28] <Cork> use on, delegate or bind
[01:48:10] <tocka> Whirl3dOrd3r where should I put that function?
[01:48:16] <tocka> before post or after?
[01:48:27] <Cork> tocka: the first think in the submit event
[01:48:40] <Cork> *thing
[01:48:40] <tocka> Ok lets try
[01:48:41] <tocka> :)
[01:48:53] <Mosselmaniac> Let me rephrase my question
[01:49:01] <Cork> tocka don't forget to grab the attribute too
[01:49:32] <AdvoWork> Cork, like: $('#column').delegate(".editable_order_line_details", "click", function(event) {	 ?
[01:49:37] <Mosselmaniac> if i do: alert(element.name); i get: "aantal[2][8]" for example. I want that 8 in a variable in jquery. how can i get that 8?
[01:49:43] <tocka> Cork it seems to work :), thanks
[01:49:59] <Cork> AdvoWork: yup
[01:50:22] <Cork> Mosselmaniac: you would have to regex match it
[01:50:57] <Cork> ?eval "aantal[2][8]".match(/\[(/d+)\]/)
[01:51:00] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: invalid regular expression flag d
[01:51:23] <Cork> ?eval "aantal[2][8]".match(/\[([0-9]+)\]/)
[01:51:24] <bot-t> Cork: ["[2]", "2"]
[01:51:34] <Cork> ?eval "aantal[2][8]".match(/\[([0-9]+)\]$/)
[01:51:34] <bot-t> Cork: ["[8]", "8"]
[01:51:39] <AdvoWork> Cork, and still use load() as I am, or do I need to change something there?
[01:51:40] <Mosselmaniac> Cork, couldn't i just get that with a parameter from that object?
[01:51:52] <Cork> Mosselmaniac: its not an object, its a string
[01:52:05] <Mosselmaniac> neh, element is an object.
[01:52:11] <Mosselmaniac> element.name is a string.
[01:52:13] <Cork> sure
[01:52:17] <Cork> exactly
[01:52:19] <Mosselmaniac> It's not necessary to do it via name ;-)
[01:52:32] <Xotix> is there something like .text() but for doocument fragments?
[01:52:37] <Cork> Mosselmaniac: is element an input element?
[01:53:12] <Mosselmaniac> it's euh...
[01:53:15] <Cork> Xotix: thats all text() is
[01:53:34] <Cork> Xotix: or do you mean return the html?
[01:54:05] <Mosselmaniac> Cork: alert (element) gives me object HTMLInputElement
[01:54:21] <Cork> ok so its an input
[01:54:34] <Cork> the name attribute is just a string, so regex is the only way
[01:54:45] <Xotix> Cork, yes, but just the text without the elements. e.g. if you have <div>span>foo</span>/div> $(div).text() you'll get foo. Even if it is nested. Same for fragments. So it is cleaned up
[01:54:58] <Cork> Mosselmaniac: unless you save the info server side in anoter attribute
[01:55:37] <Cork> Xotix: text should return all text inside the selected element or its children
[01:55:47] <Mosselmaniac> Cork: i use this as a workaround to get just that 8 in my jquery validation.
[01:56:09] <Mosselmaniac> It all seems a bit of a hack ;-)
[01:56:17] <Cork> then the regex is your only option
[01:56:22] <Cork> ?eval "aantal[2][8]".match(/\[([0-9]+)\]$/)[1]
[01:56:23] <bot-t> Cork: "8"
[01:56:32] <Mosselmaniac> cool ;-)
[01:56:37] <Xotix> Cork, exactly, but i get '' if i do it with the fragment, but I'm sure it isn't empty. How can i check?
[01:57:00] <Mosselmaniac> eval "aantal[2][8123456]".match(/\[([0-9]+)\]$/)[1]
[01:57:01] <caniuse> Mosselmaniac: '8123456'
[01:57:02] <Cork> Xotix: what do you mean by fragment?
[01:57:05] <Mosselmaniac> ?eval "aantal[2][8123456]".match(/\[([0-9]+)\]$/)[1]
[01:57:06] <bot-t> Mosselmaniac: "8123456"
[01:58:18] <jarr0dsz> hey everyone
[01:58:25] <jarr0dsz> i have small js snippet with an error in it but i dont see it
[01:58:26] <Whirl3dOrd3r> I have an article (div) inside a page (div) inside of a section (div). The section and page get loaded via ajax. If I have an element that requests the article div, I can't return the article until I load the section and then load the page. I figured I would return a deferred object for the article and page that would resolve once the section was loaded...
[01:58:29] <jarr0dsz> http://pastie.org/private/gd9oregr7dbtablos84sa anyone might want to take a look
[01:58:34] <jarr0dsz> my IDE flags it as invalid
[01:58:58] <Xotix> document Fragment -> document.createDocumentFragment(), maybe, I'm understanding something wrong and trying something bad.
[01:59:55] <quicksilver> $(alert('bl')); is very bizarre, jarr0dsz, but not actually invalid.
[02:00:18] <quicksilver> I don't see anything invalid in that code.
[02:00:26] <jarr0dsz> quicksilver: even if i remove that the last line }); seems invalid
[02:00:37] <jarr0dsz> because the 2nd block with the alert seems never executed
[02:00:52] <Cork> Xotix: so your basically just creating a new document
[02:01:07] <Cork> Xotix: as long as you refer to an element inside the document it should work fine
[02:01:32] <Cork> Xotix: text/html can't work with the entire document tough (just like you can't do $(document).html() )
[02:01:35] <AdvoWork> Cork, I've got an issue, even with doing it this way: $('#column').delegate(".add_product_to_po", "click", function(e) {   basically, that opens a dialog, and when i press a button on the dialog ( "Add Product": function() { it does $(this).dialog( "close" ); the first time this works,but on the second load() it doesn't close. Any ideas?
[02:02:19] <Cork> AdvoWork: might be the code executes before the new id's been added to the dom
[02:02:21] <Cork> not sure
[02:02:31] <Xotix> Cork, okay another question. if you have a script with a timeout, does JS not stop and wait for the timeout to proceed but proceed the  code after  the timeout and jump back if the timeup is "done"?
[02:02:57] <Cork> Xotix: setTimeout is async, just like ajax
[02:03:13] <Cork> Xotix: the function ends, THEN the timeout is called, at earliest
[02:03:53] <AdvoWork> Cork, what can i do to account for that?
[02:04:22] <Cork> AdvoWork: not sure, never loaded js in fragments like that
[02:04:32] <Xotix> ok thanks
[02:04:32] <quicksilver> jarr0dsz: your code is fine. I switched it to document.ready and ran it in a jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/LWnKh/
[02:04:33] <Cork> i've always separated them
[02:04:49] <jarr0dsz> quicksilver: okay thx strange then some IDE quirck then
[02:06:07] <softmanpetro> I try to replace a image width with imghtml.replace(/(width=")\d/, '$1120'); but I fail
[02:07:16] <jarr0dsz> im trying to make it remove a class but it just won't work :(
[02:07:20] <jarr0dsz> its not full example but http://jsfiddle.net/j9pxS/
[02:07:31] <jarr0dsz> the alert gets shown correctly when iclick the close class
[02:07:46] <jarr0dsz> only the parent class is not removed "expanded" should be removed from parent wich is not happening
[02:07:51] <jarr0dsz> any ideas what im missing?
[02:10:16] <jarr0dsz> ok figured it out i need the parent of the parent
[02:10:20] <jarr0dsz> is there a way to do that with jquery?
[02:12:25] <gerryvdm> does jquery have a global timer by chance (for animations etc), where i can add my own callbacks to?
[02:14:50] <Mosselmaniac> Cork?
[02:15:09] <Mosselmaniac> Can i ask a stupid question.... how can i store that eval match in a var? sorry :-/
[02:16:46] <S0lign0c> Mosselmaniac: var dou = eval("2+2");
[02:16:51] <S0lign0c> ?
[02:17:50] <scalebyte> i wanna copy an div on click and make it appear under the last div of the parent div
[02:17:58] <scalebyte> how can I do that in jquery?
[02:18:02] <scalebyte> i wanna copy an div on click and make it appear under the last div of the parent div
[02:18:05] <scalebyte> how can I do that in jquery?
[02:18:31] <Cork> scalebyte: $(this).parent().append($(this).clone())
[02:18:45] <scalebyte> Cork: thanks will try with it
[02:18:59] <sjeijk> Morning
[02:19:32] <scalebyte> Cork: the div has text fields and so how can I make the textfields name unique each time i click and textfields are generated?
[02:20:08] <Cork> scalebyte: buy searching for them and modifying them before you do append
[02:20:32] <patrickvw> morning can I convert an Id from 0 to 00 and 1 to 01. For example in Access can you do this with format.
[02:20:40] <scalebyte> Cork: oh my god... it sounds so difficult.. Am new to jquery :)
[02:20:52] <Cork> scalebyte:  var clone = $(this).clone(); clone.find('input').attr('name', 'new-name'); $(this).parent().append(clone)
[02:21:15] <Cork> scalebyte: add [name="name-to-find"] in the selector
[02:21:21] <scalebyte> Cork: thanks... U r a jquery expert :)
[02:21:26] <Cork> or use .each to handle each one
[02:22:12] <scalebyte> Cork: u know rails ?
[02:22:17] <Cork> scalebyte:  var clone = $(this).clone(); clone.find('input').each(function() { $(this).attr('name', $(this).attr('name') + '1'); }); $(this).parent().append(clone)
[02:22:20] <Cork> scalebyte: yes
[02:22:32] <scalebyte> Cork: thank god u cud help me then.. will u ?
[02:22:58] <Cork> only with direct questions, i don't have time for more then that
[02:23:38] <scalebyte> Cork: if u cud help me now.. that will be very kind since my work is at stake if i dnt get this done.. my manager doesnt even think i am new to all these just 18 :(
[02:23:39] <scalebyte> https://gist.github.com/2005970
[02:23:44] <scalebyte> Cork: ^^
[02:24:28] <scalebyte> Cork: here line 25 and 33 are loops... inside hash
[02:24:34] <Cork> ugg coffiescript?
[02:25:28] <scalebyte> Cork: so both key and valu of hashes are editable.. so am viewing then in text fields.. but hw can I give them unique names also user can add as many fields on click as he wants and enter those values
[02:25:51] <scalebyte> Cork: yes coffee script.. u can help me in jquery and js and I can convert then to coffeescript...
[02:26:29] <taipres> scalebyte you drink coffee?
[02:26:34] <scalebyte> Cork: user.profile.detail[:prior_experience][:data] is array of hashes  [{"TCS"=>"Trainee"}, {"Infosys"=>"Engineer"}]
[02:26:48] <Cork> scalebyte: i have a hard time following that spageti so...
[02:26:48] <scalebyte> taipres: yes
[02:26:55] <Cork> sorry
[02:27:02] <scalebyte> Cork: that is html slim
[02:27:25] <Cork> never used it
[02:40:51] <Xotix> Cork, there is no jQuery component which supports IE cross  domain ajax post right? HAve to do the workaround by my own.
[02:41:35] <Cork> you need to use XDomainRequest yes
[02:41:44] <Xotix> good thanks
[02:41:48] <Cork> and you need to write your own form parser server sidde
[02:41:50] <Cork> *side
[02:41:57] <scalebyte> Cork: i can get you the html version of uit if you want !!
[02:42:03] <Cork> Xotix: as XDomainRequest deliperetly breaks that
[02:42:28] <Xotix> you mean, $_Post will not work?
[02:42:36] <Cork> most likly
[02:42:41] <Xotix> great :)
[02:43:07] <Cork> XDomainRequest sets the submition type to text/plain
[02:43:28] <Cork> so post data isn't parsed by most server languages
[02:43:41] <Cork> not actually sure about php
[02:43:49] <Xotix> ok thanks
[02:43:57] <Cork> but go, asp, rails, perl breaks
[02:45:21] <scalebyte> Cork: $(".controls.knome-multi-row:last").parent().append($(".controls.knome-multi-row:last").clone()) is working but it comes with the data in it how can I clear it ?
[02:45:59] <Cork> if its a form you can do [0].reset()
[02:47:18] <raj> how can I simulate word-wrap so the text wraps if it goes beyond the width of the div?
[02:47:43] <scalebyte> Cork: so will it be $(".controls.knome-multi-row:last").parent().append($(".controls.knome-multi-row:last").clone())[0].reset()    ?
[02:47:44] <Cork> simulate?
[02:48:12] <raj> I'm adding text using .html()
[02:48:32] <Cork> scalebyte: no you need to find the form on the clone (and if there isn't one you need to empty the fields your self)
[02:48:33] <raj> but it currently just cuts off if the div width isn't enough
[02:48:49] <Cork> raj: just set a max-width on the div
[02:48:54] <Cork> and it should wrap on its own
[02:49:06] <raj> the div is adjustable though
[02:49:16] <raj> it's from a jquery-ui dialog
[02:49:37] <scalebyte> Cork: yes I have a form...
[02:49:38] <Cork> that should have a width by default
[02:49:40] <scalebyte> Cork: <form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="/en/users/17" class="simple_form form-horizontal form-vertical knome-legendless" id="edit_user_17" method="post" novalidate="novalidate"><div style="margin:0;padding:0;display:inline"><input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="✓"><input name="_method" type="hidden" value="put"><input name="authenticity_token" type="hidden" value="y4QgC4MBiNIiryNOcJt31FoT1iuErMvTTb8kKXtCF/k="></div><div clas
[02:50:06] <Cork> scalebyte: the way to reset the new clone is by resetting the elements in it
[02:50:29] <raj> Cork, http://babasociety.local:6543/asdf (asdf:asdf to login) and then click on Change Picture link next to the word "hi" on the left. Then try uploading a file that isn't a picture
[02:50:30] <Cork> theres no magic bullet, its still dom manipulation even if you use jquery
[02:50:38] <scalebyte> Cork: exaclty.. so what do I need to add to this ?  $(".controls.knome-multi-row:last").parent().append($(".controls.knome-multi-row:last").clone())
[02:50:42] <raj> oops, that's local
[02:50:57] * Cork busy
[02:50:57] <raj> http://71.232.89.204:8080/asdf
[02:51:09] <Trisox> :D
[02:51:22] <Trisox> Cork: no pretending ;)
[02:51:57] <scalebyte> Cork: exaclty.. so what do I need to add to this ?  $(".controls.knome-multi-row:last").parent().append($(".controls.knome-multi-row:last").clone())
[02:52:07] <Cork> Trisox: that i'm busy isn't pretending in any way or form
[02:52:24] <Cork> afk would be though
[02:52:34] <Trisox> that your bizzy :P
[02:52:42] <Trisox> ;)
[02:54:27] <Xotix> Cork, for non cross domain, $.ajax/post should work for ie?
[02:54:43] <scalebyte> Cork: need help bro... ^^
[02:55:03] <Cork> Xotix: yes
[02:56:57] <scalebyte> Cork: I did $(".controls.knome-multi-row:last").parent().append($(".controls.knome-multi-row:last").clone()).val(""); but still doesnt work
[02:57:51] <Cork> scalebyte: that would try to set attribute value to "" on the parent element
[02:58:19] <scalebyte> Cork: then what do i need to do ?
[02:58:35] <Cork> scalebyte: sorry, like i said, i don't have time to code your page for you
[02:58:42] <scalebyte> Cork: reset from the form or from the element itself?
[02:58:56] <Cork> reset only works if you do it on a form element
[02:59:00] <scalebyte> Cork: i just need a command from you
[03:00:16] <scalebyte> Cork: this isnt working either
[03:00:16] <scalebyte> C
[03:00:20] <scalebyte> Cork: $(".controls.knome-multi-row:last").parent().clone()).find("input:text").val("").end(). append($(".controls.knome-multi-row:last")
[03:01:47] <raj> Mr. Cork, any idea?
[03:02:05] <Cork> raj: like i said sorry i don't have time
[03:02:12] <raj> oh, didn't know that was for me
[03:02:15] <raj> k
[03:02:22] <Cork> it was generic :)
[03:04:48] <scalebyte> Cork: help me please......................
[03:05:06] <scalebyte> Cork: this doenst work either : $(".controls.knome-multi-row:last").parent().append($(".controls.knome-multi-row:last").clone().val(""))
[03:05:16] <Xotix> Cork, how about loading a script crossdomain and doing the post like that?
[03:05:39] <Cork> you can do get calls through the script tag ya
[03:05:50] <Cork> Xotix: also called jsonp
[03:07:08] <makinen> how can I find a toggled td by its id and parent selector?
[03:07:28] <Cork> ('.parent > #id')
[03:07:38] <quicksilver> although if it's got an ID, you just use the ID
[03:07:48] <Cork> ya
[03:09:00] <makinen> this seems not to be working: parent_tr.next().find('td').each(...
[03:09:40] <Cork> makinen: that looks correct, what do you get if you do parent_tr.next().length ?
[03:10:04] <makinen> when I log each element the toggled td isn't found
[03:10:42] <Cork> makinen: what do you mean toggled?
[03:11:05] <makinen> $('td#asd').toggle()
[03:13:41] <makinen> Cork: it returns 1
[03:14:32] <Cork> so you want to find if the td is shown or hidden?
[03:15:36] <makinen> it's been hidden before and now I want to set it visible again
[03:18:07] <Cork> ?:visible @ makinen
[03:18:08] <bot-t> makinen, :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[03:18:14] <Cork> ?:not
[03:18:14] <bot-t> :not(selector): Selects all elements that do not match the given selector. http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[03:31:37] <nathanstaines> what would you recommend as a great resource for JavaScript/jQuery conventions? Things like tabs vs spaces for indentation, function/variable naming camelCase vs underscores etc
[03:31:46] <scalebyte> Cork: $(".controls.second:last").parent().append($(".controls.second:last").clone().find("input:text").val("").end()) worked perfectly... now how can I have a link attached with it for closing it ?
[03:32:56] <Cork> scalebyte: you mean removing the cloned div?
[03:33:50] <Zelest> what's the proper way of adding a row in a table? jquery prepend() or append() with a insanely long line feels really ugly..
[03:34:07] <bartmax> Zelest: prepend add it to the begining, append to the end.
[03:34:08] <Cork> scalebyte: append($('<a/>').click(function() { $(this).parent().remove(); }));
[03:34:50] <scalebyte> Cork: thanks
[03:34:52] <Cork> Zelest: that is the fastest way; though you can create the tr, then append td to it
[03:35:04] <Cork> followed by appending/prepending it to the table
[03:35:16] <Zelest> ah true
[03:35:45] <scalebyte> Cork: $(".controls.knome-multi-row:last").parent().append($(".controls.knome-multi-row:last").clone().find("input:text").val("").end()).append($('<a/>').click(function() { $(this).parent().remove(); }));
[03:35:50] <scalebyte> Cork: not working
[03:36:15] <Cork> scalebyte: make sure you add it to the correct div
[03:39:30] <scalebyte> Cork: worked beautifully charm... :)
[03:39:32] <Styles>  http://privatepaste.com/66f8095044 - The else statement for 'add row' were we reset the cell data, it doesn't seem to be adding up right ... I can't figure it out... http://www.codeomegaprime.lino.kpstart.com/steam/servers.htm
[03:39:33] <scalebyte> Cork: $(".controls.knome-multi-row:last").parent().append($(".controls.knome-multi-row:last").clone().find("input:text").val("").end().append($('<a> close<a/>').click(function() { $(this).parent().remove(); })));
[03:39:56] <Styles> cells isn't found, so I assume I'm doing it wrong
[03:40:28] <scalebyte> Cork: but the only doubt is how can I get the text field names unique each time
[03:40:59] <Cork> scalebyte: you could ex. have a counter
[03:41:10] <Cork> or use $.timestamp
[03:44:32] <scalebyte> Cork: timestamp will have huge value right...and what when i load it from the database ?
[03:44:53] <Cork> scalebyte: its the unix time ya
[03:47:12] <scalebyte> Cork: hmmm...but when I load it from db.. the loading will be happening at same time so there cud b possibility of confict in name?
[03:47:36] <Cork> scalebyte: ya, so a counter then
[03:48:05] <Cork> or <input name="name[]">
[03:48:39] <scalebyte> Cork: how ?
[03:48:52] <Cork> uh.. you set an [] after the name?
[03:53:08] <scalebyte> Cork: $(".controls.knome-multi-row:last").parent().append($(".controls.knome-multi-row:last").clone().find("input:text").val("").end().append($('<a> close<a/>').click(function() { $(this).parent().remove(); })));
[03:53:23] <scalebyte> Cork: this is fine but on the second click i have two links
[03:53:33] <scalebyte> Cork: third click 3 links like that
[03:53:47] <scalebyte> Cork: since i am doing $(".controls.knome-multi-row:last")
[03:53:55] <scalebyte> Cork: how can I fix that issue ?
[03:55:16] <Cork> scalebyte: either add it to the element once and clone the events or add it to the clone and not the original
[03:58:09] <scalebyte> Cork: i added it to the clone and not the original but it keeps coming double triple since I am cloning the :last tried :first also but no change
[04:00:05] <scalebyte> Cork: this worked :)
[04:00:07] <scalebyte> Cork: $(".controls.knome-multi-row:last").parent().append($(".controls.knome-multi-row:first").clone().find("input:text").val("").end().append($('<a> close<a/>').click(function() { $(this).parent().remove(); })));
[04:06:33] <nathanstaines> can someone recommend me a good resource for JavaScript/jQuery conventions? Things like tabs vs spaces for indentation, function/variable naming camelCase vs underscores etc
[04:12:32] <f3rr31r4> boa tarde / good afternoon
[04:17:42] <Zelest> if I have a table.. where the first column has a id (a numeric value) .. can i somehow select the right "row" with jquery?
[04:18:01] <Zelest> like, $('table tbody tr td[content="123"]') or something
[04:21:48] <JackBauer24> Zelest: you mean the next column, not the row, right?
[04:23:09] <Zelest> i meant the column.. looks like http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/ is what I'm looking for :)
[04:24:00] <ChuckieChan> Zelest: that is what you are looking for :)
[04:24:19] <Zelest> a ":is" would be nicer though.. rather than *value* :P
[04:24:31] <Zelest> e.g, if I select 1... and i have 3 rows.. 1, 10 and 100.. i will then match all 3
[04:26:11] <NoReGreT> any idea of how to refer to $(this) in the jquery form plugin (in data field) ?
[04:31:26] <ChuckieChan> Zelest: i think you have to aggregate on the elemets to find it
[04:31:44] <ChuckieChan> elements*
[04:43:54] <fRAiLtY-> Hi is there any way I can get the value of a drop-down and echo it somewhere ? dynamically?
[04:44:02] <Zelest> ChuckieChan, ah true.. and the table is pretty small as well, so it's not THAT heavy :)
[04:51:16] <fRAiLtY-> Hi is there any way I can get the value of a drop-down and echo it somewhere ? dynamically?
[04:54:39] <standard12> hello, can anyone help me with jquery validation?
[04:54:45] <standard12> I'm getting a pretty weird error.

[04:56:30] <Zelest> how can i replace the content of a td with jquery if it doesn't have a id or class? If I have $('table tbody tr:first') for example, how can i change the content of the 5th column?
[04:56:39] <standard12> click 'submit' you'll see what I mean
[04:57:19] <standard12> if you click on the label after the "This field is required." text is keeps generating a new error
[04:57:51] <scalebyte> standard12: the textfield colors are so dark offending reduce the contrast
[04:58:07] <standard12> Oh yeah Its not a finished design.
[05:00:30] <johanhar> I would like to do something when an element changes class, is that possible? Will that go under "change" event, change of class?
[05:00:39] <standard12> scalebyte: fixed the input field text :)
[05:01:09] <scalebyte> standard12: much better :)
[05:01:17] <scalebyte> standard12: u know jquery well ?
[05:01:35] <standard12> scalebyte: not really, I've played about with it mostly editing existing scripts
[05:01:46] <aqeel> hi room
[05:01:47] <bot-t> (6 hours 42 mins ago) <coldhead> tell aqeel i will never ever forget you and your unforgettable divinity
[05:02:06] <scalebyte> standard12: ok nice... hw can i name dynamically generated text fields uniquely ?
[05:02:35] <standard12> scalebyte: what do you mean?
[05:02:58] <standard12> scalebyte: I'm not really sure I can help with that, I was looking for help my self =)
[05:03:19] <scalebyte> standard12: i am generating text fields on click using jquery.. hw can I name these text fields uniquely ?
[05:03:27] <scalebyte> standard12: never mind
[05:03:38] <scalebyte> standard12: what help are u  looking for ?
[05:04:00] <aqeel> please restate your questions
[05:04:10] <standard12> like I said before, when the validation errors kick in, clicking on the input fields again causes duplicate error messages.
[05:04:12] <aqeel> i might be of some help
[05:04:47] <aqeel> and what do u have thus far
[05:04:51] <standard12>  I edited the validation script so that it would put the error messages in a div with the class "errmsg", it only happens when I add this but it doesnt seem to be an error in the code as the div's are generating correctly
[05:04:54] <aqeel> jsfiddle?
[05:04:57] <standard12> http://www.smoothfinancial.co.uk/sandbox/index.php
[05:05:18] <standard12> just the basic validation plugin off the jquery site
[05:05:34] <aberratio> Scalebite: You could either use the current date and time for naming your input fields. Or generate a random string. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1349404/generate-a-string-of-5-random-characters-in-javascript
[05:06:10] <aqeel> clear the contents then have it shown again
[05:06:20] <standard12> 1 sec
[05:07:57] <standard12> I cleared it so its just a div, it was a label but that broke my current labels
[05:08:01] <standard12> http://www.smoothfinancial.co.uk/sandbox/index.php
[05:08:57] <standard12> seems adding a class makes it generate a new error on click
[05:09:07] <standard12> 		errorElement: "div class=\"validate\"",
[05:09:17] <standard12> on line  212
[05:11:27] <aqeel> i cant seem to find that
[05:11:35] <aqeel> which page the index or js
[05:14:02] <kzo> hello
[05:15:35] <aqeel> standard12>...seems u have fixed it
[05:19:10] <standard12> aqeel: yeah, I just specified in the css that only div.error has properties
[05:19:25] <standard12> i had only .error which was affecting the label/input fields :)
[05:19:40] <aqeel> nice to know u fixed it
[05:19:52] <standard12> thanks =)
[05:20:03] <aqeel> u r welcome

[05:36:23] <poppiez> hi guys. I've made this image carousel, which works fine. I want the images to be able to be printed when using native print (cmd/ctrl+p). problem is, I'm using background images for the carousel. what can I do?
[05:38:19] <fuchstronaut> I have a div-box containing a div and a table, how can i place that divbox OVER a certain row of the table by using jquery?
[05:39:31] <aqeel> how many rows of table u want covered
[05:39:50] <fuchstronaut> just one
[05:40:01] <aqeel> height specified?
[05:40:12] <fuchstronaut> no
[05:40:15] <aqeel> for the div above table?
[05:40:47] <fuchstronaut> well, i can find out the height by using div.height(), no?
[05:40:59] <aqeel> yes and add the cell height
[05:41:08] <aqeel> that is what u needed
[05:41:47] <aqeel> but do keep in mind the resizing of browser window will have impact on it
[05:42:02] <jomofcw> aqeel ie tester doesn't seem to work exactly as the original IE. in fact, it display me error for IE9, where IE9 original doesn't have any error.
[05:42:45] <aqeel> can u see if ie 9 is truly not returning error?
[05:42:57] <aqeel> for me working like a charm'
[05:44:09] <fuchstronaut> thanks for your help aqeel, i think i will have to find another way
[05:44:10] <aqeel> well other than this i have few more but they are paid and there are some online ie simulation provider too...which i do not use
[05:44:43] <aqeel> i read all this in dreamweaver the missing manual...
[05:45:05] <aqeel> if u want i can look up the links for u
[05:45:25] <jomofcw> aqeel thanks for your help anyway
[05:45:33] <aqeel> u  r welcome
[05:46:44] <jomofcw> =)
[05:47:38] <aqeel> to make everyone happy.....install....safari,ie,firefox,chrome,opera........safari will sure test for mac platform which is a plus.....for multi ie platform using ie tester.....
[05:47:50] <aqeel> well oh boy...what can be done in browser war
[05:49:25] <NoReGreT_> can someone explain why .on() sometimes doesn't work in the future?
[05:49:36] <aqeel> ???
[05:49:47] <aqeel> how are u using it
[05:49:48] <dreen> rofl
[05:50:05] <aqeel> it always does for me
[05:50:08] <poppiez> hi guys. I've made this image carousel, which works fine. I want the images to be able to be printed when using native print (cmd/ctrl+p). problem is, I'm using background images for the carousel. what can I do?
[05:50:13] <aqeel> it is based on bubble
[05:50:48] <aqeel> it will pick anything u specify in the containing container
[05:51:05] <NoReGreT_> aqeel: should it work fine with the submit event ?
[05:51:07] <aqeel> else u specify document and it will work no matter what u do
[05:51:16] <jomofcw> aqeel true ^^ ! thanks :)
[05:51:21] <NoReGreT_> aqeel: it worked fine with me on click/mouseenter/mouseleave events
[05:51:32] <NoReGreT_> aqeel: but not with submit event
[05:51:35] <NoReGreT_> any idea why ?
[05:52:17] <aqeel> may be because of the page not yet loaded and code is still rendering
[05:52:38] <aqeel> u have load set on it?
[05:52:58] <NoReGreT_> aqeel: http://pastie.org/3555977
[05:53:41] <noregret> aqeel: since it's in the future, it is added dynamically
[05:53:48] <noregret> so the page is of course fully loaded
[05:53:54] <aqeel> let me see
[05:54:16] <scalebyte> I have a line like this to clone the previous div
[05:54:17] <scalebyte>      $(".controls.second:last").parent().append $(".controls.second:first").clone().find("input:text").val("").end().append($("<a> close<a/>").click(->       $(this).parent().remove()      ))
[05:54:18] <noregret> it worked nicely with me using click/mouseenter events..
[05:54:52] <scalebyte> but if there is no .controls.second:first then how can add a new div ?
[05:55:32] <dirkpennings> guys, I want to push a key and value to an array using: data.push({ $(e).attr('name') : $(e).find('option:selected').val().toLowerCase() });
[05:55:44] <dirkpennings> but it fails, saying: "missing : after property id"
[05:57:07] <dirkpennings> do I have to use a predefined key or can I use this? (maybe in an other way)
[05:58:04] <aqeel> noregret...........
[05:58:06] <aqeel>  $(this).parent().prev().prev().prev().prev().prev().find('p').text()
[05:58:12] <aqeel> why such line
[05:58:26] <aqeel> why not use id and class
[05:58:33] <aqeel> just get there
[06:00:07] <noregret> aqeel: because i want it relative to $(this), in the same page, there many elements with teh same class.. any idea of another way to refer to them with respect to this ?
[06:00:35] <aqeel> in on it can get any where in the specified container
[06:01:18] <thebignoise> does jquery run sync or async, and if sync is there a way to make it async because all of my animations seem to be a bit jittery
[06:01:25] <Ddorda> hey guys, i'm looking for a simple way to import json to the DOM. ideas?
[06:02:02] <noregret> aqeel: it is like so http://pastie.org/3555977
[06:02:05] <aqeel> u can use each() to iterate on every element and perform specific task
[06:02:54] <noregret> aqeel: those 4 classes you see get repeated after the last one.. so do you have another traversing method ?
[06:03:07] <noregret> 6 classes i mean
[06:03:28] <noregret> date, who, msg, desc, anIcon, sendemail
[06:03:43] <noregret> aqeel: they get repeated after senemail
[06:03:51] <noregret> sendemail *
[06:03:55] <aqeel> ok
[06:04:22] * JAAulde hates when he puts his beautiful client code into the release version of the product and a PHP-loving server-monkey coworker comes along and mucks it up.
[06:04:36] <noregret> aqeel: any better traversing method than the one already used ?
[06:04:42] <standard12> quick question, would anyone recommend learning javascript or php first?
[06:05:10] <aqeel> your opinion on what u want ot achieve
[06:05:51] <thebignoise> standard12: one is server-side and one is client-side doesnt make to much of a difference IMO
[06:06:10] <standard12> I'm not sure, ideally I want to learn them both...
[06:06:17] <standard12> Which is easier?
[06:06:35] <Logikos> I'd learn php first, i use php to generate my javascript sometimes....
[06:06:55] <Logikos> also as you get into ajax you'll want a server side technology anyways
[06:06:58] <JAAulde> I generate my PHP client side and send it ot the server via ajax for execution
[06:07:12] <thebignoise> Logikos: makes a good point
[06:07:26] <Logikos> JAAulde: i assume your jokeing, but if not, that is very foolish
[06:07:42] <standard12> Thanks for the input, php it is =)
[06:07:51] <JAAulde> Logikos: ???
[06:07:54] <Logikos> there is no reason why you cant learn them together
[06:07:56] <JAAulde> Logikos: :P ;)
[06:08:00] <Logikos> :)
[06:08:02] <standard12> Any recommended place to start? w3 schools leaves much to be desired
[06:08:10] <Logikos> php.net
[06:08:32] <thebignoise> standard12: i learned by doing trivial task
[06:08:32] <Logikos> php has one of the of the best manuals you will find.... very very useful
[06:08:33] <Milossh> hey; how can I fetch the json and store it in a var so that that var holds all the objects in json?
[06:08:36] <Logikos> i gota run ... bbl
[06:08:51] <noregret> aqeel: did you figure out the .on problem ?
[06:09:54] <standard12> Trivial task?

[06:14:02] <ezio> what should i do to create large html areas more efficiently
[06:14:37] <ezio> large innerhtml content
[06:16:29] <aqeel> '<div class="sendemail">' +
[06:16:40] <aqeel> why u code in quotations the html part...???
[06:16:57] <aqeel> it seems u are mixing everything up
[06:17:27] <aqeel> ezio how u want to do ....
[06:17:39] <aqeel> entire page at onje go...
[06:17:45] <aqeel> one*
[06:18:05] <ezio> i want to build html from data arrays
[06:18:16] <xarxer> It's not possible to call a PHP class' static functions via AJAX without a helper PHP script, right?
[06:18:36] <aqeel> well php is not my field at the moment still learning
[06:18:40] <ezio> xarxer, i don't follow
[06:18:48] <aqeel> so i cant help but the loading part jquery might can
[06:19:26] <xarxer> Like $.post("classes/Article.php", {something}, function(returned) {}); Where my class definition is in Article.php
[06:20:08] <xarxer> And I wish to get the data that a static function in the Article class returns..
[06:20:08] <ezio> xarxer, http://www.technotaste.com/blog/simple-php-front-controller/
[06:20:35] <noregret> aqeel: i copy/pasted tht from JS.. dont worry much about syntax...
[06:20:51] <ezio> once you learn front controller pattern it litterally takes 5 minutes to code one at the start of every project
[06:20:55] <aqeel> well u did it wrong way then
[06:20:57] <noregret> aqeel: that is in a var that i am .append()ing, got it ?
[06:21:03] <aqeel> u  are mixing the both
[06:21:13] <aqeel> script must be within the scipt tag
[06:21:19] <aqeel> in html
[06:21:20] <noregret> aqeel: i don't get it, what am i doing wrong..
[06:21:23] <noregret> aqeel: it is....
[06:21:28] <noregret> i didn't copy everything
[06:21:35] <noregret> aqeel: just the relevant
[06:21:40] <noregret> forget syntax
[06:21:52] <ezio> xarxer, one really awesome thing about a front controller is that when you want to change the url style it takes minutes
[06:21:56] <aqeel> it is not the syntax but the entire code...
[06:22:13] <xarxer> ezio: I don't think this is really related to my problem.. hmm..
[06:22:51] <ezio> xarxer, what you need is an guard man who takes in coming requests and says ... okay request you go here. next.
[06:23:06] <ezio> then you can say
[06:23:47] <ezio> if($page =='my_request') { do this
[06:24:12] <ezio> and this can be anything
[06:24:13] <aqeel> noregret.....http://jsfiddle.net/UPnxB/
[06:24:19] <ezio> including the creation of a new object
[06:24:19] <ezio> or
[06:24:25] <ezio> the calling of a static function
[06:24:28] <aqeel> this entire code is html
[06:25:36] <ezio> not to mention it takes care of all your loads
[06:26:33] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/9rJWt/1/
[06:26:51] <martz_> hello, does anyone here know how you can make a link to a part of the page in jquery mobile? In a long page where you want someone to link to the bottom for example (same tactic as wiki pages use)?

[06:27:21] <aqeel> use anchor
[06:28:25] <Xotix> how can i create a node out of a div?
[06:29:07] <ezio> Xotix, the browser renders it from text

[06:31:05] <ezio> Xotix, you want a jquery object of a div that is yet to be created right?
[06:31:45] <aqeel> get this selected or look for selected
[06:31:56] <hurry> ezio:  i have checkbox, and i use onclick for call function in my js file.  i want know if which checkbox is selected and i want know when it's not checked
[06:32:23] <ezio> AdvoWork, .attr('selected', 'selected')
[06:32:29] <ezio> or
[06:32:37] <ezio> "<option selected='selected'
[06:32:51] <Xotix> erio no. sry, i want a docuemnt fragment from a div

[06:34:58] <Slouma2000_> hurry,if($('#checkbox-id').is(':checked'))
[06:35:19] <Iszak> or .prop('checked')
[06:35:50] <hurry> thanks guys
[06:35:53] <nFFF> OR $('#checkbox-id:checked')
[06:35:55] <nFFF> :>>
[06:37:33] <Slouma2000_> you can test also the number of checked check box
[06:37:56] <Milossh> hey; how can I fetch the json and store it in a var so that that var holds all the objects in json?
[06:37:58] <Slouma2000_> $('.checkbox-class:checked').length
[06:38:20] <martz_> Does anyone know how to use anchors in Jquery mobile?
[06:39:14] <ezio> xarxer, i hope you took my advice
[06:39:50] <xarxer> ezio: Yes, but I'm experimenting a little.. Thanks :)
[06:40:36] <ezio> xarxer, it makes urls look pretty, too.  instead of sales.php?id=30 ... /sales/30
[06:42:31] <aqeel> martz_....................................http://jsfiddle.net/r9u4t/1/
[06:42:47] <aqeel> it is working but u need to give some distance to jump to
[06:43:59] <martz_> okay **** then
[06:44:05] <martz_> because its not working on my mobile site
[06:44:47] <martz_> but thanks anyway- do you know if this should work with jquery mobile too?
[06:45:04] <aqeel> yes this is default html
[06:45:25] <aqeel> no js used...
[06:45:49] <martz_> okay, do you know what is wrong with my code when it doesnt work?
[06:45:59] <martz_> i mean do you have a idea where i have to look?
[06:46:30] <aqeel> start from where u want to jump and see where to jump....if content is within scroll it will not jump
[06:47:07] <aqeel> try giving some extra height then when finalizing give your dimensions
[06:47:23] <ctk> how do i gain access to an anonymous function from within a $.each()? http://jsfiddle.net/PebNj/3/
[06:47:35] <something_> hi there
[06:47:40] <Zogot> martz_: The site I built uses a slide to and works on mobile http://www.groenkerk.nl/
[06:47:47] <Zogot> You can see the JS with chrome or so
[06:47:53] <ctk> or inside another anonymous function for that matter
[06:49:47] <martz_> ok Zogot thanks
[06:50:12] <martz_> and @aqeel thanks for the tips, but it still isnt working, might be something that is getting blocked by jquery mobile it seems
[06:51:28] <aqeel> well if u could show me
[06:51:42] <aqeel> i might have helped it...thanks
[06:52:11] <aqeel> u still have the smple at hand and can make use of that site from zogot
[06:53:24] <Zogot> Any feedback on my JS for that site would be appreciated.  Just dont look at the form object, only had 3 hours to make the Form found under "Action"
[06:55:01] <aqeel> well impressive and good looking long though but nicely m,aintained with the menu in place at all times
[06:56:21] <jeffsmykil> is there a diference in passing parameters when the function is inside an append versus a string concat
[06:57:12] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/aEZpz/
[06:57:31] <aqeel> how to recover the multi links called
[06:57:37] <jeffsmykil> I have this http://pastebin.com/73wCU1s8
[06:57:51] <jeffsmykil> and its passing individual as a variable instead of a string
[06:57:54] <aqeel> mainmenulink();
[06:59:14] <Zogot> aqeel: what are you trying to do with that code?
[07:00:05] <aqeel> links in container 1 calls container 2 links
[07:00:28] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[07:01:00] <aqeel> but i want to make a function that makes the bridge between the two links
[07:01:24] <aqeel> so i do not need to add links manually
[07:01:32] <aqeel> in js that will  be
[07:01:40] <Xotix> aqeel ur link is broken
[07:02:56] <jeffsmykil> Having trouble with this passing individual as a variable instead of a string: http://pastebin.com/73wCU1s8
[07:03:45] <aqeel> sorry the loading got stopped ....unknown reason......reuploading it
[07:05:52] <jeffsmykil> no one?
[07:06:18] <martz_> Zogot: are you still here?
[07:06:24] <Zogot> aye
[07:07:01] <aqeel> ok referesh now
[07:07:23] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[07:07:52] <martz_> can you explain how you got that scrolling stuff working?
[07:07:59] <martz_> is that a plugin?
[07:08:24] <aqeel> u can see the source
[07:08:45] <aqeel> zogot,xotix
[07:09:08] <Zogot> martz_: No its not a plugin, just the animate control
[07:09:12] <tktiddle> I want to select an element with the property for="form_0"  whats the correct selector?
[07:09:17] <Xotix> Cork did u know about xdr.contentType = "text/plain";?
[07:09:40] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: you around?
[07:09:42] <Zogot> martz: If your wondering why the JS looks like it does, its to do with the code layout (called Object Literal if your interested)
[07:10:54] <martz_> @ Zogot okay, i dont understand that, but is the way it scrolls only a visual effect? (and still using 'anchor'?)
[07:11:22] <seydar> hey i got an issue with AJAX POST requests
[07:11:22] <seydar> http://bigbad.evils.in/
[07:11:33] <seydar> the form there does not send a POST, it sends a GET
[07:11:55] <Zogot> martz_: http://pastebin.com/qLwfgX6h see line 52 and 59
[07:12:19] <burg> is there any way i can make sortable to only start drag and sort only after mouse is down for 2 seconds on sortable element?
[07:12:23] <seydar> what's wrong with what I have? i wrote the javascript to be identical to the example listed on the docs
[07:13:26] <AdvoWork> how would I go about removing all rows with a c ertain table name?
[07:14:08] <aqeel> rows or remove table entirely?
[07:15:05] <felixqc> seydar: i bet your .submit is not triggered
[07:15:08] <martz_> Okay thanks Zogot for the trouble, but this is to hard for me, dont have a clue what it all says
[07:15:23] <seydar> felixqc: that would explain EVERYTHING
[07:15:24] <felixqc> seydar: try adding an alert in your .submit, somewhere..
[07:15:33] <AdvoWork> aqeel, just the rows with that specific name
[07:15:39] <aqeel> take deep breath and relax and absorb at your pace as u drink your coffee
[07:15:41] <felixqc> seydar: load your jquery.js in the <head>
[07:16:29] <aqeel> so how the rows are created...u can simply replace your contents tr with empty tr
[07:17:25] <jeffsmykil> anyone know why this isn;t working?
[07:17:26] <jeffsmykil> ('<div class="buttonLeftOrange"></div><input id="inspectEquipment" type="button" class="button orange" value="Inspect Equipment" onclick="Biomed.showInspectionDialog(' + data.EquipmentId + ',' + referer + ');"/><div class="buttonRighttOrange"></div>');
[07:17:31] <jeffsmykil> shoot
[07:17:33] <jeffsmykil> sorry
[07:17:40] <seydar> felixqc: k, i did that, but it's not better yet

[07:18:02] <LordThumper> Hi
[07:18:19] <seydar> felixqc: got it
[07:18:43] <seydar> felixqc: claudio from #javascript pointed out that i had $("searchForm") and not $("#searchForm")
[07:19:21] <LordThumper> Is there some jQuery that allows an autocomplete combobox that allows multiple selects one at a time
[07:19:43] <LordThumper> The user can remove a selected item from the textbox individually
[07:23:12] <aqeel> got to go bye room thanks
[07:25:04] <drakythe> So succefully been walked through using jquery to hide/unhide fields based on a select list. I'm now trying to do the same thing, but with a multiple value select list, is this possible?
[07:26:06] <drakythe> Here is what I have so far, just not operating the way I'd like/think it would http://jsfiddle.net/drakythe/eQq45/1/
[07:28:07] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: you around?
[07:28:16] <xec> drakythe: what are you trying to do? just hide/show a div if there is anything selected?
[07:28:42] <drakythe> xec: only show if a certain one is selected, hide it else
[07:29:12] <drakythe> if the "Other" option is selected, then a new text area should popup
[07:29:14] <Ddorda> hey guys, i'm trying to rewrite a function into .on function. this is the source: http://pastebin.fr/22326 . how should i handle the .filter() ?
[07:29:43] <xec> drakythe: http://jsfiddle.net/eQq45/3/
[07:30:43] <xec> drakythe: you had set the var as "contribute" and then tried to reference it as "details" apparently
[07:30:44] <drakythe> xec: Oh good grief!
[07:30:48] <drakythe> xec: thank you
[07:31:21] <drakythe> xec: Out of curiosity, since this is a multi-select field is it possible for that text area to show up if "Other" is select along with other items on the list?
[07:32:15] <xec> drakythe: yea, i would probably do it in the selector i think, and check length
[07:32:36] <drakythe> xec: Okay, I think that makes sense. Thanks again!
[07:33:07] <LordThumper> Is the a jQuery plugin similar to the jQuery UI autocomplete with multiple values
[07:33:16] <xec> drakythe: http://jsfiddle.net/eQq45/4/
[07:33:21] <LordThumper> That allows selected values to be removed by a small (x) next to them?
[07:33:41] <drakythe> xec: awesome
[07:34:16] <smplstk> drakythe: In Rod we trust.
[07:35:04] <monk12> hey guys, more generic question ... is the console in IE9 always available or ONLY when F12 developer tools is open? i write to console.log in my code. and i have an override if console.log doesnt exist (like for old browsers), I show the log in a popup window in our dev env... So in IE9 on my system the regular F12 developer tools doesnt need to be open for it to record the log... but on my coworkers computer when she doesn't have the F12 dev tools open, it
[07:35:05] <monk12> uses my override function and pops up my 'console window' for her (but if she opens the F12 dev tools, it records in its console log).
[07:35:44] <monk12> not sure why the different behavior.
[07:35:56] <drakythe> smplstk: rofl
[07:36:06] <smplstk> monk12: not the same version of IE, perhaps?
[07:36:29] <monk12> i thought maybe... but we both have IE9 :(
[07:36:45] <monk12> (I changed so we both using ie9 standard mode i thought too. I could try that again.)
[07:36:55] <monk12> dont think it should make a difference^
[07:38:08] <Trisox> monk12: console.log breaks older browsers never use them in production
[07:38:18] <smplstk> monk12: if you're just checking for 'console', I would just loose the alert() fallback
[07:38:24] <jeffsmykil> http://pastebin.com/73wCU1s8
[07:38:29] <Trisox> alert is beter for older browsers
[07:38:31] <jeffsmykil> anhyone have ANY idea how to make this work?
[07:38:33] <smplstk> unless you need it to debug in IE6, it's kind of useless.
[07:38:34] <xec> LordThumper: not that i know of, but jquery autocomplete does work for multiple, it just makes a simple comma separated list http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#multiple
[07:38:41] <Trisox> alert indeed
[07:38:51] <Trisox> i use alerts in ie always
[07:39:18] <smplstk> you don't use console.log() or alert() in "production"
[07:39:19] <Trisox> smplstk: its useless for ie7 also
[07:39:25] <Trisox> smplstk: duh
[07:39:43] <Trisox> console.log is easy to leave in it.. mistake often made
[07:39:58] <jarr0dsz> hey everyone
[07:40:08] <jarr0dsz> im having lot of trouble converting       getFlashMovie('video1').setProperty('src', document.getElementById('url1').value + '?somevar=' + document.getElementById('somear2').value)"/ to jquery
[07:40:11] <jarr0dsz> anyone could give me a help?
[07:40:23] <jarr0dsz> im trying to implement a video player and that jquery loads it in
[07:40:45] <jeffsmykil> I cant get <input id="inspectEquipment" class="button orange" type="button" onclick="Biomed.showInspectionDialog(182,individual);" value="Inspect Equipment"> the individual to be a string
[07:40:58] <jeffsmykil> all of the quote types are used
[07:41:02] <jeffsmykil> I dont know what to do
[07:41:06] <jeffsmykil> please help
[07:41:33] <Trisox> Biomed.showInspectionDialog('182',individual);
[07:41:36] <Trisox> prob
[07:41:50] <jeffsmykil> individual would be a variable still
[07:41:50] <Trisox> wild guese
[07:41:53] <xec> monk12: yea, i've had that problem too, and it appears Trisox has too. in IE9 there is only a console object after the console is loaded (f12 is pressed) - and will break if not
[07:42:10] <Trisox> i dont have the problem ;)
[07:42:23] <Trisox> i know it for long time :D
[07:42:23] <jeffsmykil> and the single quotes are used for the whole string to append
[07:42:27] <monk12> hah, interesting. Thanks xec.
[07:42:36] <Trisox> escape them?
[07:42:44] <jeffsmykil> Trisox tried it
[07:42:57] <xec> Trisox: hence "had" ;)
[07:43:14] <Trisox> :P
[07:43:42] <Trisox> you got a script by paul irish i think that you can put in so it doesnt break
[07:43:46] <Trisox> if you left one behind
[07:44:11] <Trisox> jeffsmykil: the 182 is a var?
[07:44:14] <Trisox> of value
[07:45:17] <MagmaRules> Hi there, has anyone ever tried something like trying to figure out a layout based on a visio like diagram draw? I saw an example on a client and I'm curious how something like this would be done in jquery =P
[07:45:19] <Trisox> alert('<input id="inspectEquipment" class="button orange" type="button" onclick="Biomed.showInspectionDialog(\'182\',individual);" value="Inspect Equipment"> ');
[07:45:36] <Trisox> this sould work
[07:45:45] <Trisox> jeffsmykil
[07:46:25] <monk12> Trisox: just wanted to show you... this is how i get 'console' working in older browsers: http://jsfiddle.net/tQp29/
[07:46:44] <monk12> I put the'1 ||' just so can see it work in Firefox.
[07:46:48] <Trisox> mm intersting
[07:47:12] <monk12> so if there is no console in your browser, it pops a popup window. and if you have it available keeps appending to it.
[07:47:12] <Trisox> thats sweet men
[07:47:23] <Trisox> bookmarking that for sure
[07:47:46] <monk12> I set it up so that debug variable is only true in our dev/qa environments.
[07:48:33] <Trisox> and false uses console
[07:48:37] <Kottizen> Hello. Is there a way to find out the height the content in a div that doesn't have any specified height:, but an overflow: set to 'hidden'?
[07:49:10] <monk12> Trisox, yeh i seen other 'Faux Consoles'. I just wanted one separately in a new window to not bother our QA people and to try to implement a simple one from mostly scratch.
[07:49:34] <Trisox> true on that
[07:49:41] <Trisox> if seen a few too
[07:49:46] <Trisox> not this one
[07:50:29] <Leviatn> hi, here just to abuse your expertise
[07:50:30] <Leviatn> What's the easiest way to split DOM like: <div class="items"><a>Foo 1</a><a>Foo 2</a>...<a>Foo 100</a></div>, to <div class="items"><div class="item"><a>Foo  1</a>,<a>Foo 2</a>...<a>Foo 20</a></div><div class="item"><a>Foo 21</a>....</div></div>
[07:50:35] <Trisox> Kottizen: how can that be
[07:50:49] <Leviatn> ie "paginating" items inside a container
[07:50:55] <Trisox> if you set no height and overflow hidden... then you see nothing
[07:51:31] <Trisox> ;)
[07:51:37] <Trisox> think about it
[07:52:12] <Kottizen> Trisox: I do... My problem is that I fetch some HTML by the means of ajax, and then I put it into a div. The content's height varies from time to time, and I'd like to know how I could measure that height and give the <div> that number
[07:52:37] <jonclark> what's the best textarea autogrow plugin these days?
[07:52:39] <Trisox> Kottizen: http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/nUqRK/
[07:52:41] <Trisox> like that?
[07:53:02] <Kottizen> Trisox: Just like that... Thanks!
[07:53:11] <Trisox> ;)
[07:53:16] <xec> ?wrap @ Leviatn
[07:53:17] <bot-t> Leviatn, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[07:53:18] <Trisox> if you see it you think ... doh!!
[07:53:18] <Kottizen> Didn't know jQuery was that clever :P
[07:53:23] <Kottizen> yeah
[07:53:23] <Trisox> haha ;)
[07:53:28] <xec> Leviatn: ^ is that what you mean?
[07:53:46] <Leviatn> maybe, but how can I control over how many items the wrapper is applied to?
[07:54:05] <Leviatn> ie. if i have 100 <a/>s in the container and I want to wrap them in groups of 20?
[07:54:14] <Trisox> make an selection with eq
[07:54:16] <Trisox> might work
[07:55:38] <Leviatn> ah, i can probably .slice() the selections
[07:56:11] <Trisox> mmm indeed could work
[07:56:15] <MagmaRules> Ok so here is an example: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/53354942/form.png Anyone has any idea how would you deduce how to draw this in html using jquery or javascript to process the layou ?
[07:56:19] <MagmaRules> *layout ?
[07:56:31] <xec> Leviatn: i would loop manually if there's an unknown number
[07:56:42] <jomofcw> Is there any one who could explain me why the script isn't load/eval in the right order under IE 7/8 on this webpage : www.variance-auto.com (OK on each other browser including IE 9) ? Please...
[07:56:54] <Trisox> off to home guys
[07:57:03] <Trisox> hf playing!
[08:05:30] <Leviatn> items.children().slice(0, 20).wrap($('<div></div>', { 'class': 'item' })); doesn't seem to work as I imagined, as each item is wrapped separately
[08:05:54] <Leviatn> which i'm sure .wrap() documentation explicitly states :
[08:05:56] <Leviatn> :P
[08:07:04] <xec> Leviatn: http://jsfiddle.net/8Quhm/
[08:07:17] <xec> i'm sure this is not the best way
[08:07:48] <asdf2345> hello
[08:08:04] <xec> oh, and i grew tired of copypasting html so i did 10 rather than 20 ;D
[08:08:22] <Leviatn> heh no worries, and cheers mate
[08:08:56] <Leviatn> i pretty much ended up with the same except with the .slice() approach
[08:12:28] <SoulRaven> hi
[08:12:30] <asdf2345> hello all, jquery 1.2.6 here. just wondering if there is a faster way to remove a fieldset id="foo" and all its children. In firefox 3.6.27 - $('#foo').remove() is very slow for me (i am using a for loop to go through a list of containers (fieldsets) that i want to remove
[08:13:07] <SoulRaven> i am try to submit a form, and in that form i have a file tag, but when i submit the form using ajax, the file tag is not present in the array from the server
[08:13:22] <SoulRaven> the form is sended to server with $.post
[08:13:38] <asdf2345> basically im using .clone() to add a group of fields/elements and .remove() to remove those fieldsets + children
[08:13:46] <NoiseEee> SoulRaven: you can't send files over traditional xhr
[08:13:48] <asdf2345> but remove() is supse slow in firefox
[08:13:53] <asdf2345> super*
[08:14:17] <SoulRaven> NoiseEee: and how i submit the form?
[08:14:20] <SoulRaven> http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1856216235
[08:18:35] <ccmonster> hey guys, i wanted to do like a racing/progress bar leaderboard idea and I didnt know if anyone had some suggestions on how to do this
[08:18:43] <VictorCL> how can I break a $.each($corrects, function(key, val) {
[08:18:48] <VictorCL> I know php has break;
[08:18:58] <jonclark> i think return false
[08:19:04] <quicksilver> read the docs for each
[08:19:05] <quicksilver> :P
[08:19:20] <jonclark> or just "return"
[08:19:31] <quicksilver> We can break the $.each() loop at a particular iteration by making the callback function return false
[08:20:27] <fris> return false is the equiv of break in php and just return is the equiv of continue in php
[08:20:58] <VictorCL> or easier ,, I have this  :  [Object { id="145490"}, Object { id="145492"}]   AND I have this : ["145491", "145490"]  , how can I quicly check if 145491 is inside any of the objet id =    ?
[08:21:22] <VictorCL> or easier ,, I have this  :  [Object { id="145490"}, Object { id="145492"}]   AND I have this : ["145491", "145490"]  , how can I quicly check if 145491 is inside any of the objet id =    ?
[08:21:49] <ccmonster> I'm not sure the best way to do this, so i'm spitballing for suggestions.
[08:22:42] <jonclark> ccmonster, so multiple progress bars?
[08:23:08] <jonclark> stacked on top of each other, for instance, changing position if they pass each other?
[08:23:57] <muszek> hi... when I select an element (for example $('.currency')), how can I tell what tag (span, input, etc.) is it?
[08:26:04] <jonclark> muszek, http://www.mkyong.com/jquery/jquery-how-to-get-the-tag-name/
[08:26:20] <muszek> jonclark: thank you
[08:26:38] <jonclark> just remember that you may have more than one element matching your selector
[08:27:16] <ccmonster> yea,
[08:27:34] <ccmonster> jonclark, yea, multiple I guess, maybe with a goofy image at the end of them (say a horse?)
[08:27:46] <ccmonster> like those old carny games where you spray the water pistol at the target.
[08:27:53] <jonclark> haha you that hypothetically but i know that's exactly what you're planning :P
[08:27:57] <jonclark> *you say that
[08:28:10] <muszek> jon: roger that
[08:28:37] <ccmonster> you talking to me jonclark ?
[08:28:41] <jonclark> yes
[08:29:38] <muszek> ccmonster: you were talking to me? :)
[08:29:39] <ccmonster> yea, a horse is kinda the first thing that popped in my head :)
[08:29:51] <poppiez> hi guys. I've made this image carousel, which works fine. I want the images to be able to be printed when using native print (cmd/ctrl+p). problem is, I'm using background images for the carousel. what can I do?
[08:29:54] <ccmonster> cheesy, but might be ideal for this. I dunno
[08:30:17] <ccmonster> Then again, I COULD just do multiple jqueryUI progressbars I guess.
[08:30:26] <muszek> I guess not
[08:30:35] <ccmonster> muszek, no I was not.
[08:33:07] <SoulRaven> without using any plugin, how i upload a file to server, using ajax
[08:33:08] <jonclark> i think the jquery ui progressbar may be a good start -- ordering them depending on their progress would be the tricky part
[08:33:17] <BadQuanta> poppiez: Why Background Images?  I only ask because I don't see what you get with manipulating an container w/ a background image that you don't get when manipulating an image.
[08:33:27] <ccmonster> html5 has some stuff you can use SoulRaven , but you'll be dependent on browser capability
[08:34:16] <BadQuanta> poppiez: If you need to add controls, you can still wrap a container element around the image and set the image to simply be absolute positioned (so that it is always the same height / width) and just set the z-index to something below the rest of the controls.
[08:36:35] <poppiez> BadQuanta: I'm using background images because it's optimized for mobile safari. <img> has a memory limit applied to them opposed to using background images
[08:36:44] <asdf2345> is there a faster way to do a .remove()? firefox seems to be very slow
[08:36:53] <poppiez> (optimized for desktop and mobile safari, that is)
[08:37:01] <BadQuanta> poppiez: Oh, well now I've learned something. :) Thanks.
[08:37:26] <poppiez> BadQuanta: heh, no problem
[08:38:03] <BadQuanta> Just curious, did you try specifying the background for the @print media type?
[08:38:13] <BadQuanta> poppiez: And did the browser just ignore it?
[08:38:29] <poppiez> BadQuanta: specify how?
[08:38:45] <poppiez> browsers don't print background images unless you tell them to
[08:38:55] <poppiez> you have to use <img>. hmmz, better start refactoring
[08:39:45] <BadQuanta> poppiez: I know, I've simply never tried specifying a background within the print media type (in css) to see if it would work, I've never had to print backgrounds.  But if you set the media to print, specify a background URL, I'm curious if that would work.
[08:39:57] <jjames_> quick question - how do i do a multiple selector, including $(this)? could i do $(this,".otherclass") ?
[08:40:48] <BadQuanta> poppiez:  @media print{p.test {background-image: url('test.png');}  }
[08:40:48] <BadQuanta> Tell you what, I'll test it for you in chrome (but i have no safari)
[08:42:07] <poppiez> BadQuanta: that won't work :)
[08:42:41] <poppiez> you have to tick a checkbox in the print dialog to enable it, which most normal users don't
[08:42:52] <masterseh> im selling my macbook pro 15" and asus g74sx laptops. anyone interested? please message me if you are.
[08:43:06] <poppiez> BadQuanta: brb
[08:43:30] <BadQuanta> poppiez: You are correct.  Just my first thought.
[08:44:39] <plln> i need tester
[08:44:48] <BadQuanta> poppiez: I was hoping that browsers simply set the print CSS to * {background-url: none;} and setting it to something !important would override.
[08:44:49] <Cancerbero_sgx> Hi All. I have problems accessing a jquery dom created from XML source code. See short self explained source http://jsfiddle.net/uYjwd/. The jquery dom object from XML sources seems to be created ok with $($.parseXML(..)) but I can't write on it using jquery api...
[08:44:55] <plln> with have low resolution display
[08:51:11] <SoulRaven> i am try to submit a form that contains a file tag and multiple text and select boxes
[08:51:42] <SoulRaven> but when i try to submit the form, from array is missing the file tag
[08:52:09] <SoulRaven> ii have this js: http://jsfiddle.net/Ewgq9/
[08:52:23] <Jon47> is there anything functionally different between…
[08:52:23] <Jon47> $('.foo, .bar')
[08:52:23] <Jon47> and
[08:52:24] <Jon47> $('.foo').add('.bar')
[08:52:25] <Jon47> like, is splitting up the selector by the commas the first thing that happens in the selector engine?
[08:52:30] <BadQuanta> SoulRaven: What about the FORM?
[08:52:54] <SoulRaven> if i submit using this setup, from server i get only the file in RAW form, without the other elements
[08:53:36] <SoulRaven> form type is multipart/form-data
[08:54:08] <BadQuanta> SoulRaven: I would like to see the FORM HTML,  also: you might want to replace line one with $(this).closest('form') unless you are doing what your doing for a reason I don't see at the moment.
[08:55:48] <plln> http://78.180.214.137/reseller/index.php  user:null password:null
[08:56:39] <SoulRaven> BadQuanta: this is the form: http://jsfiddle.net/Ewgq9/1/
[08:57:06] <SoulRaven> BadQuanta: this form is located in a dialog window, this is the reason for the line 1
[08:58:38] <BadQuanta> SoulRaven:  I see.  By dialog do you mean a <div> tag or another Document Window?
[08:58:54] <SoulRaven> a div tah
[08:58:56] <SoulRaven> tag
[08:59:18] <BadQuanta> SoulRaven: So (this) is Not a child of form?
[09:00:16] <SoulRaven> ho, this is the button of the handler
[09:00:38] <SoulRaven> http://jsfiddle.net/Ewgq9/2/
[09:00:43] <SoulRaven> the full js code
[09:01:30] <supsup> prob already been said but if anyone has published node npm package -- u need to go generate a new account they found flaw, all accounts was leaking hash of password
[09:04:11] <BadQuanta> SoulRaven: What do you use formSerialize for?
[09:04:32] <SoulRaven> var formSerialize = $(form).serialize(); ??
[09:04:49] <SoulRaven> to serialize the elements inside the form
[09:05:03] <BadQuanta> SoulRaven: Right, but you don't pass it anywhere.
[09:05:26] <SoulRaven> in that bin, no, i try every solution
[09:05:31] <BadQuanta> SoulRaven: You pass 'data', not 'formSerialze'
[09:05:41] <BadQuanta> SoulRaven: I see, and what is the FormData class?
[09:05:51] <BadQuanta> SoulRaven: At least, I'm not familiar with it.
[09:06:10] <SoulRaven> if i pas formSerialize i get all the forms data, with ou file tag
[09:06:32] <BadQuanta> What if you append to formSerialize instead of data?
[09:06:56] <SoulRaven> i want to upload a image in that form
[09:07:12] <SoulRaven> and pass to server the form with image and form elements
[09:08:38] <SoulRaven> this is the data when i pass to server: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1935722103
[09:09:03] <SoulRaven> is missing the picture element, that is the file tag
[09:09:40] <BadQuanta> SoulRaven: I am pretty sure I understand that.  From what I understand of the serialize documentation, File Content is explicitly not supported.
[09:10:37] <SoulRaven> so how i upload a file in the same time when i post a form
[09:11:27] <BadQuanta> SoulRaven: http://www.openjs.com/articles/ajax/ajax_file_upload/
[09:11:46] <BadQuanta> SoulRaven: Looks like you can't do this Via JS.  Which makes sense to me because IF you could, that means that JS can DIRECTLY READ FILE CONTENTS.
[09:12:08] <NoiseEee> you can upload files over xhr, im not sure if jquery has it built in
[09:12:16] <BadQuanta> SoulRaven: The solution seems to be to do this within an IFrame and LET THE IFRAME do a regular submit.
[09:12:22] <NoiseEee> google 'xhr upload files html5'
[09:12:29] <BadQuanta> NoiseEee: Thanks. :)
[09:14:00] <BadQuanta> SoulRaven: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Using_files_from_web_applications
[09:14:13] <BadQuanta> SoulRaven: This seems to be broken down well enough for you to pick what you need out of it.
[09:14:27] <BadQuanta> SoulRaven: Does not depend on jQuery from what I've scanned so far.
[09:14:37] <SoulRaven> :(
[09:18:46] <Germanaz0> hello everybody
[09:20:40] <xec> hi Germanaz0!!
[09:20:57] <Germanaz0> a lot of programming today :D
[09:22:21] <Germanaz0> someone knows why tinymce could remove me the src from an image ?
[09:23:41] <xec> Germanaz0: how does this relate to jquery?
[09:24:04] <Germanaz0> bcs I have tinymce for JQ
[09:26:01] <xec> i have no idea, never used it
[09:26:38] <xec> and now is time for weekend!
[09:29:12] <Germanaz0> no weekend for wick
[09:31:55] <Cancerbero_sgx> I keep having problems with append(String) in xml parsed documents with $.parseXML. Now I can see what the problem is, Full question at http://forum.jquery.com/topic/using-append-string-with-parsed-xml-documents
[09:32:42] <Cancerbero_sgx> when using append(String) it will create the new elements in main html document, not in my parsed  XML document dom, and so they won't be attached to my xml dom.
[09:32:59] <Cancerbero_sgx> is there a way of telling append(string) to use a custom XML document for creating the new elements ?
[09:33:52] <srm> hi. Why does $('.myClass').appenend('<script type="text/javascript">Document.write(document.URL);</script>') break, i.e. when executed in FF's console, the page get's blank and nothing happens. It's just an academic question to understand the behaviour of JS/jQuery
[09:34:02] <srm> s/appenend/append
[09:34:08] <Cancerbero_sgx> I wonder if append(string) is  the only method of jquery API with this problem. Is a shame since jquery is saving me a lot of work manipulating parsed xml documents
[09:37:19] <Cancerbero_sgx> the link of my question is http://pastie.org/3558550
[09:38:23] <ziz_> hey guys, probably the easiest question of the day.. trying to implement this carousel, where to I put step 3? http://www.gmarwaha.com/blog/2007/08/09/jcarousel-lite-a-jquery-plugin/
[09:43:08] <Whirl3dOrd3r> can someone help me with a super simple plugin? I need to be able to call $.scaleTo(el, targ) or $(elem).resizeTo(targ) and I can't get the plugin' nomenclature right..
[09:47:43] <Mark__> Guys I am using button function of Jquery UI but when I hover over the button on the page(the ubtton is inside of table with 100% width) I got extra vertical scrollbar on my page
[09:48:00] <Mark__> i can';t post code right now I am just  curious if somebody has same problem?
[09:57:29] <Ring0`> Hello. in php we can define default value for function arg, example: function foo($arg, $anotherarg = NULL); then if we don't define 2nd argument when calling function it will be NULL. Do we have jQuery equivalent?
[10:04:28] <coachz> hi, how can  I test if my select drop down is unselected please ?
[10:04:54] <Germanaz0> Ring0` you could use this
[10:05:33] <Germanaz0> function something(var1, var2) { if (typeof(var2) == 'undefined')} alert('hello') }
[10:11:43] <srm> repost: hi. Why does $('.myClass').appenend('<script type="text/javascript">Document.write(document.URL);</script>') break, i.e. when executed in FF's console, the page get's blank and nothing happens. It's just an academic question to understand the behaviour of JS/jQuery
[10:12:42] <nFFF> srm
[10:12:50] <nFFF> look at the spelling of ?append
[10:13:01] <srm> s/appened/append
[10:13:25] <ccmonster> hey guys, trying to get a parent div to grow as a child <p> expands.
[10:13:30] <chovy> document.write, not Document.write
[10:13:45] <srm> ok, I should have fixed the post. Just imagine there's "append" written.
[10:14:14] <fris> you dont need script tags either
[10:14:44] <nFFF> or even better
[10:14:48] <nFFF> he doesn't need the whole line
[10:15:26] <srm> chovy: no, that's not the problem.
[10:15:34] <nFFF> append(document.URL);
[10:16:21] <srm> Additionally, an .appenend('<script type="text/javascript">$('#myFunnyId').text(document.URL);</script>') works. (Please, this is purely academical, I know that this is quirky and superfluous)
[10:16:29] <srm> argh! s/appened/append
[10:16:51] <Taktaal> you might want to doublecheck your spelling in the source now just for safety :P
[10:17:46] <srm> I did. And the error would be completely different. "Nothing happens" is probably the wrong description for what happens: Imagine, the page gets blank, firefox claims to reload the page but nothing is loaded. just stuck.
[10:17:56] <nFFF> Your crazy :>
[10:18:47] <chovy> srm: are you trying to reload the page or just write out the url.
[10:19:48] <Ring0`> Germanaz0: thanks.
[10:20:44] <jjames_> quick question - is it possible to select a hovered element? like this, but it's not working: $(":hover").doSomething()
[10:21:04] <srm> chovy: more detail - I receive a html-string from a server, describing backend-failure. this html string is then taken, body/html are stripped and the rest is used to create an error message overlay. the snippet above is jsut hidden in the html string and breaks the whole process when appending.
[10:21:33] <srm> chovy: where "snippet" = <script type ....bla
[10:22:47] <srm> so basically, I have to take what the server provides. I could use some magic and strip the stupid script node but, say, I want to understand this behavior for learning purposes
[10:23:28] <Germanaz0> srm so when you try to get from ajax an HTML body with <script> it strips the script ?
[10:24:05] <srm> Germanaz0: pardon, what?
[10:24:11] <Germanaz0> nothing xD
[10:24:26] <thebignoise> so i have a lot of ajax requests and animations going on at once and it seems to lag out the animations. is there a way to fix this? or make is a 'one after another process'?
[10:24:27] <Germanaz0> I thought that you made a question
[10:25:08] <srm> no, I tried to explain in more detail......general noob-fail, starting with a simple scenario just to explain "No, wait! It's way more complex"...sorry for that :)
[10:26:13] <thebignoise> basically i want to make everything asynchronous
[10:29:09] <hobbeswalsh> Hey guys, I'm relatively new to Jquery and Javascript, but I'll try to formulate a coherent question... I've got some jquery code that's sending a POST to some asynchronous code that will return individual JSON objects as they're ready. is there a good way to handle this with jQuery?
[10:30:07] <hobbeswalsh> I don't really want to wait until *all* the data is ready and then return it as one chunk, I'd rather return it as it arrives. I'm open to any suggestions, or pointers towards docs, or whatever.
[10:30:17] <srm> hobbeswalsh: jQuery + Ajax
[10:31:39] <microhxo> I am trying to use ui.tabs rotator and I am getting the error "this.anchors is undefined" inside of ui.tabs.js  I am making the call like so: jQuery("#rotator").tabs().tabs("rotate", 4000, true);
[10:32:20] <microhxo> It worked with the previous version of ui.tabs.js 1.7.2 but i changed to 1.8 because of a rotation bug of overlapping.
[10:32:22] <hobbeswalsh> srm: since I'm new to this whole model, can you provide me with a pointer to some reading on the subject?
[10:33:51] <Germanaz0> microhxo
[10:33:56] <microhxo> yes?
[10:33:57] <srm> hobbeswalsh: start here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29
[10:34:05] <Germanaz0> do you have more than one id called #rotator in your body ?
[10:34:21] <Germanaz0> sometimes happens that you copy paste code
[10:34:29] <Germanaz0> and put 2 or more divs with same ID
[10:34:32] <srm> hobbeswalsh: you'll end up there http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/
[10:34:33] <Germanaz0> or more elements
[10:34:51] <microhxo> No, just one id = "rotator"
[10:36:30] <hobbeswalsh> srm: thanks
[10:36:41] <opeologist> sup all, i think i'm overanalyzing my code, and was wondering if someone could help me straighten it out to get it working right..
[10:37:18] <opeologist> i'm trying to make an if statement check if there's nothing in the background of a class, and if there is nothing,  then change it to display something, and then else change it to nothing
[10:37:33] <microhxo> Germanaz0: here is my html: http://paste2.org/p/1933713
[10:37:33] <srm> hobbeswalsh: np, have fun.
[10:37:35] <opeologist> but i think i'm formatting the {}'s right >_<
[10:38:19] <opeologist> this is my code right now:
[10:38:19] <opeologist> http://pastebin.com/7qSfQQcK
[10:39:26] <johnkpaul> opeologist: you can't pass css( a boolean
[10:39:32] <opeologist> hm
[10:39:37] <johnkpaul> I think you mean $().css("background") == ""
[10:39:54] <Taktaal> both the ready and the click are events
[10:40:03] <Taktaal> they need to be on the same level
[10:40:29] <opeologist> so don't put 0 in the quotations?
[10:41:37] <opeologist> not quite sure what you two think would fix my issue.. :(
[10:44:52] <opeologist> johnkpaul, i'm confused on what you were saying i should do.  care to elaborate?
[10:45:17] <johnkpaul> opeologist: I think that you might need to learn a little more javascript before you can learn this, but css() does not take a boolean parameter
[10:45:17] <johnkpaul> !css
[10:45:22] <johnkpaul> `css
[10:45:28] <johnkpaul> !help
[10:45:39] <johnkpaul> opeologist: http://api.jquery.com/css/
[10:45:49] <danzik171> johnkpaul: it's see ?css
[10:45:50] <bot-t> johnkpaul, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[10:45:53] <opeologist> so in essence i can't use an if/else statement with .css you mean?
[10:46:10] <johnkpaul> that's true as well, you cannot
[10:46:16] <johnkpaul> thanks danzik171!
[10:46:23] <johnkpaul> you want soemthing like $().css("background") == ""
[10:46:26] <opeologist> so do you think there's a way to accomplish what i'm trying to do?
[10:46:30] <johnkpaul> yes, there is
[10:46:43] <johnkpaul> if($().css("background") == "") is what you want to do
[10:47:06] <johnkpaul> http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_bot_commands
[10:47:10] <johnkpaul> that's what I need to bookmark!
[10:47:36] <danzik171> opeologist: .css also takes a function instead of a straight value - you can return whatever value you want to set from in there.
[10:48:00] <opeologist> right
[10:48:09] <opeologist> so i just take out the 0 and i should be good?
[10:48:48] <opeologist> i'm getting unexpected token } as an error >_<
[10:49:59] <microhxo> I am trying to use ui.tabs rotator and I am getting the error "this.anchors is undefined" inside of ui.tabs.js  I am making the call like so: jQuery("#rotator").tabs().tabs("rotate", 4000, true);
[10:50:03] <microhxo> It worked with the previous version of ui.tabs.js 1.7.2 but i changed to 1.8 because of a rotation bug of overlapping.
[10:50:09] <microhxo> here is my html: http://paste2.org/p/1933713
[10:50:43] <ziz_> hey guys, probably the easiest question of the day.. trying to implement this carousel, where to I put step 3? http://www.gmarwaha.com/blog/2007/08/09/jcarousel-lite-a-jquery-plugin/
[10:55:01] <johnkpaul> ziz_: somewhere in your javascript after domready
[10:58:19] <v_y> does anyone use <map> any more?
[10:58:38] <johnkpaul> v_y: yes, sometimes
[10:59:06] <Taktaal> does anyone know why i cannot replace the contents of a <script> tag with .html('replacement'), but it works with innerHTML?
[10:59:08] <Taktaal> http://paste2.org/p/1933745
[10:59:32] <v_y> hmm, interesting
[10:59:45] <v_y> i wonder if i can use maps as jqueryui .droppable targets?
[11:01:35] <Zzaichik> Taktaal: http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum91/2912.htm
[11:02:19] <Zzaichik> meh, that's probably not what you were asking.
[11:02:53] <Taktaal> the pure javascript code works
[11:03:00] <Taktaal> but its jquery variant doesnt
[11:03:16] <Taktaal> but its only for <script> tags, and only happens when the string contains valid html
[11:04:07] <aghouseh> having a scope issue.. can someone take a look at http://pastie.org/3559120
[11:12:21] <p3rsist> Hi guys. Is there a way to have a iframe or javascript modal window in the corner of the window overlapping the current browser tap for notifications?
[11:12:52] <ringotwo> what is a browser tap
[11:12:57] <p3rsist> tab* :P
[11:13:30] <ringotwo> you can't put anything outside of the browser window. the tab is outside of the window
[11:13:32] <p3rsist> Sorry I mean permanent... not notifications. I want a small window in the corner to overlap the browser.
[11:13:44] <Taktaal> an iframe with absolute positioning
[11:13:57] <p3rsist> Yes I want a new window
[11:14:07] <ringotwo> what notifications are you talking about?
[11:14:15] <ringotwo> from a certain website?
[11:14:22] <ringotwo> oh, sorry
[11:14:23] <ringotwo> nm
[11:14:39] <p3rsist> I want the user to be able to input data without the need of having the full open page...Therefore a new window in the corner of the page
[11:14:44] <ringotwo> you want a small window in the corner to overlap what exactly?
[11:14:48] <p3rsist> An iFrame is the best way to go?
[11:15:00] <ringotwo> i think a modal is a better choice
[11:15:02] <Taktaal> yeah, popup windows are a thing of the past
[11:15:20] <p3rsist> ringotwo: A modal requires the user to have the tab open...
[11:15:42] <ringotwo> what "tab" are you talking about?
[11:15:54] <ringotwo> i don't understand, sorry
[11:16:29] <p3rsist> For example, the user is working on multiple desktop programs. I would like to have this small window in the corner of the window so the user is not required to have to go to the full screen website... YOu know what I mean. By tab, I mean the active tab in the browser.
[11:16:44] <ringotwo> oh
[11:16:55] <ringotwo> so that's a new window, though, that's not an iframe
[11:17:09] <ringotwo> you're talking about popping open a new browser window with now controls on it
[11:17:29] <p3rsist> ringotwo: Yes exactly
[11:17:35] <ringotwo> window.open()
[11:17:54] <ringotwo> but... most browsers have popup blockers built in
[11:17:57] <p3rsist> I can specify the size and the position of it?
[11:18:11] <p3rsist> No problem with that.
[11:18:12] <ringotwo> you're going to run into issues where the window isn't going to open
[11:18:21] <ringotwo> yes, you can specify size
[11:18:23] <p3rsist> The same controls are in the full page
[11:18:38] <ringotwo> position usually, but not realiable
[11:18:41] <p3rsist> but I want the user to be able to access those controls in a small window for usability
[11:18:52] <p3rsist> not cross-browser?
[11:19:17] <ringotwo> most of the time you can specify position
[11:19:25] <ringotwo> but i don't think you can guarantee it
[11:19:28] <p3rsist> instead of having to do an all-tab all the time and switching between the full page browser and its other desktop apps. You understand why Im doing that now.
[11:20:03] <ringotwo> yes, but if this is a critical piece of functionality, i wouldn't recommend it
[11:20:16] <ringotwo> if it's just a nice-to-have, then yeah, sure, i suppose it could be useful
[11:20:35] <ringotwo> but you don't need an iframe, you just need a new window
[11:22:40] <ringotwo> the new window will have to communicate with the parent window to force it to reload the parent window assuming the login is successful
[11:22:52] <ringotwo> it's tricky, you're gonna have some questiosn
[11:23:27] <p3rsist> alt*-tab
[11:23:28] <p3rsist> is there an handler in jquery for that?
[11:23:28] <p3rsist> or I go native js?
[11:24:05] <johnkpaul> there's definitely nothing OOTB with jquery but take a look at this http://www.josscrowcroft.com/projects/jquery-appmenu/
[11:26:15] <SoulRaven> anyone has experience with html5 and file upload using ajax?
[11:26:55] <p3rsist> ringotwo: Well, the new window will ajax form data to the server. The parent window will ajax the server to fetch the new info. Is that easier for inter-window communication?
[11:27:31] <SoulRaven> i have try this, but is not working, i get nothing from the server: http://jsfiddle.net/kFP8q/1/
[11:27:56] <SoulRaven> here, is the example for jquery: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/XMLHttpRequest/Using_XMLHttpRequest#Using_FormData_objects
[11:29:41] <SoulRaven> if i apend manualy some data is working, i get something from the server, if not i get nothing:
[11:29:43] <SoulRaven> fd.append("CustomField", "This is some extra data");
[11:32:36] <johnkpaul> SoulRaven: what is formAction?
[11:33:01] <codeWarrior42> howdy
[11:33:33] <SoulRaven> johnkpaul: this is the js code
[11:33:33] <SoulRaven> http://jsfiddle.net/kFP8q/2/
[11:34:04] <SoulRaven> with formAction i get the form action atribute to pass in ajax method

[11:39:55] <bartmax> in knockout viewmodel have: Currencies = curArray, Lines { currency: 2 }, how can i do a mapping plugin to get symbol based on a root array for each line ?
[11:40:35] <SoulRaven> johnkpaul: i know about json, but for now i will only find out what is passed to the server
[11:40:57] <SoulRaven> if the server get any data from POST action
[11:41:05] <SoulRaven> with file tag in that post
[11:41:27] <SoulRaven> because now i get only what i manualy append
[11:41:33] <ringotwo> you should ask in the knockout google group
[11:41:45] <johnkpaul> hm so by itself, jquery can't handle ajax fileuploads
[11:42:02] <ringotwo> knockout has a mapping plugin already
[11:42:05] <SoulRaven> if i want to pass the data i pass with serialize, and is ok, but with out fie tag
[11:42:11] <johnkpaul> yes

[11:43:10] <bot-t> socialhapy, http://thechive.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/tumblr_ljo1qjzk111qj4qw8o1_500.gif
[11:43:16] <bartmax> ringotwo: ty, hold on
[11:44:21] <p3rsist> Thanks all
[11:45:04] <bartmax> ringotwo: http://jsfiddle.net/5U2ZU/
[11:46:07] <ringotwo> p3rsist, how does the parent window know to send an ajax request
[11:46:35] <ringotwo> ok
[11:47:24] <nook__> someone have an idear of my mistake?
[11:48:01] <ringotwo> bartmax, what does this mean: // data.Currencies have an array of object (Currency) that have Symbol on it.
[11:48:19] <p3rsist> ringotwo: Its need to poll the server every one minute to refresh the server anyway...so at the same time.. it will retrieve the new data (if there is new data)
[11:48:25] <bartmax> let me paste the whole data object
[11:49:09] <bartmax> ringotwo: http://jsfiddle.net/5U2ZU/1/
[11:49:11] <ringotwo> if someone logs in, they probably expect to see the page immediately
[11:49:29] <ringotwo> to see the refresh, i mena
[11:49:54] <ringotwo> you don't need to use ajax separately in the popup
[11:50:08] <ringotwo> the parent window can access the popup form elements directly
[11:50:54] <ringotwo> you can use jquery to access child window form inputs
[11:51:14] <p3rsist> ringotwo: Nice. I guess thats better.
[11:51:49] <ringotwo> it's a little more difficult to write, i guess
[11:51:50] <p3rsist> ringotwo: So the parent knows when the form button has been clicked and then makes an ajax request to the server and therefore has the new information.
[11:52:38] <p3rsist> immediately instead of having to wait a max of (refreshPeriod/2)
[11:53:23] <ringotwo> umm, i take that advice back, because there are goign to be other issues that would be difficult
[11:53:47] <ringotwo> for instance, i'm not sure an event can be assigned from the parent into the child
[11:54:09] <ringotwo> i know you can access form values, but i don't know if you can set events
[11:54:10] <bartmax> ringotwo: all that isn't for me right? :D
[11:54:17] <ringotwo> ha, hold on
[11:54:32] <bartmax> ringotwo: sure, just to be sure :)
[11:54:49] <ringotwo> if the separate ajax is good enough for the user, then go for it
[11:54:56] <ringotwo> you could poll more often than one minute
[11:55:27] <millermedeiros> FYI, yesterday I asked if anyone knew a jquery plugin for keyboard events + key combinations that allowed bubbling events and could remove a single listener, since I couldn't find it I ended up forking jquery.hotkeys and it was merged: https://github.com/tzuryby/jquery.hotkeys/pull/20 - just in case anyone needs it or is considering doing something similar
[11:55:28] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery.hotkeys by millermedeiros (12h, 52m ago): Change the way plugin works to use namespaces instead of special data
[11:55:45] <ringotwo> bartmax, looking at the object
[11:57:09] <Ring0`> Hey. I have <div id="parent"><div id="child"></div></div>; there is $('#parent').click(); How can I do that this click will ignore child (wont work when click on child area) ?
[11:57:30] <ringotwo> bartmax, it seems like you don't want to use computed, right?
[11:57:51] <bartmax> ringotwo: im new to ko. not sure what i 'want' to use :D
[11:58:00] <ringotwo> are you trying to generate a string with the symbol and amount?
[11:58:39] <bartmax> ringotwo: exactly, I have an array with currencies, then with price lines, each price line have a idcurrency. I want to match the CurrencySymbol from the Currency Array with the idCurrency in the line
[11:58:55] <bartmax> using the mapping plugin.
[11:59:20] <ringotwo> what is it returning currently?
[11:59:28] <ringotwo> does it return this.IdCurrency?
[12:00:07] <bartmax> yes.
[12:00:12] <bartmax> because line has the idCurrency
[12:00:41] <ringotwo> give me an example of what you want the result to look like for one entry
[12:00:45] <ringotwo> $500
[12:00:46] <ringotwo> ?
[12:01:25] <bartmax> yes
[12:01:40] <bartmax> ill paste the tbody
[12:01:42] <bartmax> in jsfiddle
[12:01:47] <ringotwo> ok
[12:02:02] <bartmax> ringotwo: http://jsfiddle.net/5U2ZU/2/
[12:02:23] <bartmax> ringotwo: forget the data-bind type, this are intentionally :D
[12:02:29] <bartmax> too much testing
[12:04:27] <ringotwo> idCurrency isn't a part of the same row of data as the Symbol
[12:05:05] <bartmax> err.. what? :d
[12:05:20] <smalldevil> Can anyone help me?
[12:05:36] <bartmax> ringotwo: updated http://jsfiddle.net/5U2ZU/3/ added a simple example of what I have in CSS panel.
[12:05:53] <KrisGosser> with the jQuery UI 1.7 date picker, i'm finding that when i change the date in the text input, it's not updating the calendar widget -- is there a preference i'm not seeing required for this?
[12:06:31] <smalldevil> $('body').not("a").live('click', function() {
[12:06:31] <smalldevil> 		      $('.featured').hide('slow');
[12:06:32] <smalldevil> 		});
[12:06:46] <Emn1ty> is there a way to renew sessions in jquery?
[12:06:47] <smalldevil> Why its not working?
[12:07:00] <KrisGosser> for what it's worth: i have an <input> and an inline datepicker called on a <div/> which updates to the <input> with altField -- I'm guessing that's the cause. but i'm not finding how to reverse back the other way
[12:07:03] <ajpiano> smalldevil: a) you can't use live with any filter methods before hand, it has to be directly on a selection
[12:07:12] <ajpiano> smalldevil: b) all 'body' tags are by definition, not 'a' tags
[12:07:12] <smalldevil> problem with not()
[12:07:27] <ravenzz> body *
[12:07:28] <ajpiano> it's not a problem with not, it's a problem with how you're thinking about the problem
[12:07:31] <ravenzz> perhaps
[12:07:36] <ringotwo> bartmax, the json object doesn't have single rows with both idcurrency and symbol
[12:07:36] <ravenzz> but it is still silly
[12:07:42] <ringotwo> check it out
[12:07:45] <ajpiano> smalldevil: $(document).on("click", ":not(a)", function() {});
[12:08:07] <ringotwo> i don't know enough about knockout mapping to help with this, sorry
[12:08:12] <smalldevil> thanks
[12:08:23] <ringotwo> at least you have a fiddle you can post to the knockout google group
[12:08:25] <smalldevil> let me try it
[12:08:30] <erichynds> Emn1ty: just hit the server with an ajax request
[12:08:37] <igcewieling> Is there any way to automatically trigger a function when .show() is called on a specific element?
[12:08:40] <ringotwo> they're pretty fast, i think
[12:08:48] <Emn1ty> alrighty
[12:09:19] <ringotwo> i think you need to flatten the json object somehow
[12:09:50] <ringotwo> maybe you can get the json differently, or you might have to do some jquery massaging of the data to get it where each row has all the information you need
[12:10:21] <Ghan> lol
[12:10:23] <Ghan> back again
[12:10:29] <igcewieling> specifically I'm calling $('.tab').show().  One of the elements with the class of tab is the one I want to run a function on .show() and .hide().
[12:10:30] <bartmax> ringotwo: i need to put the symbol in any single line ?
[12:10:33] <Ghan> how can i hide images with a certain src?
[12:10:56] <KrisGosser> Ghan: regex or possibly something with filter()
[12:10:56] <smalldevil> Ist not working as it should have
[12:11:10] <bartmax> ringotwo: actually the json have single rows with idcurrency and symbol on the Currencies object
[12:11:22] <bartmax> hi ajpiano
[12:11:39] <ringotwo> bartmax, i don't see currencies having idCurrency
[12:11:54] <bartmax> ringotwo: Currencies.Id = IdCurrency
[12:11:56] <Ghan> anyone got a quick example ?
[12:11:56] <igcewieling> The only way I can think of to accomplish this is for my function, which runs once per min checks to see if the element is visible before doing anything
[12:12:06] <Ghan> hide all images with src small_image.jpg
[12:12:07] <igcewieling> seems ugly to me
[12:12:07] <bartmax> ringotwo: that (different name) is a problem ?
[12:12:16] <ringotwo> i just don't understand what the heck IdCurrency: 1 means?
[12:12:26] <igcewieling> Ghan: can you give all those elements the same class?
[12:12:27] <smalldevil> $(document).on("click", ":not(a)", function() {
[12:12:28] <smalldevil> 			$('.featured').hide('slow');
[12:12:28] <smalldevil> 		});
[12:12:40] <smalldevil> What is the problem with it?
[12:12:47] <bartmax> ringotwo: I have a line that say it's price is : 200 with idCurrency = 1
[12:12:51] <Ghan> igcewieling: sure
[12:12:54] <Ghan> addClass
[12:12:57] <Ghan> of .css
[12:13:06] <Ghan> or
[12:13:07] <bartmax> and an array Currencies having 1 : U$S, 2: $, 3: YEN, etc.
[12:13:15] <smalldevil> I do not want to hide element when user clicks on links
[12:13:26] <bartmax> Line.IdCurrency should match Currencies.Id
[12:13:32] <igcewieling> Ghan: I was implying you could then do a $('smallClass').hide()
[12:13:32] <ringotwo> ohhh
[12:13:40] <ringotwo> i see
[12:13:41] <igcewieling> ..er.. .smallClass of course
[12:14:33] <Ghan> igcewieling: well that's simple… what i want is to give all the images with that src a class
[12:14:38] <ringotwo> gimme sec bartmax
[12:14:41] <bartmax> ringotwo: sure
[12:14:43] <bartmax> ringotwo: thanks
[12:14:48] <smalldevil> can anyone help me?
[12:16:32] <ringotwo> bartmax, i'm adding to the original fiddle

[12:17:51] <SoulRaven> the 7 answer is ok:)
[12:18:26] <KrisGosser> earlier i had a question relating to the jQuery UI date picker and inline/altfield stuff. would someone be willing to give me a direction?
[12:18:33] <Ghan> jQuery("img[src='small_image.jpg']").addClass('test');
[12:18:40] <Ghan> doesn't work
[12:18:40] <caniuse> doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[12:18:42] <Ghan> …..
[12:18:57] <jeffsmykil_> KrisGosser: date picker is just one of my arch nemesises
[12:19:19] <smalldevil> please anyone?
[12:19:26] <KrisGosser> basically: the <input> isn't updating the inline <div/> picker on change -- is this something I can do with a method like refresh(), or does it need to be custom with keypress and so on ?
[12:19:49] <pm83> salve
[12:20:04] <jeffsmykil_> anyone have any experience with chosen?
[12:20:43] <smalldevil> $(document).on("click", ":not(a)", function() {
[12:20:43] <smalldevil> 			$('.featured').hide('slow');
[12:20:43] <smalldevil> 		});
[12:21:02] <smalldevil> not(a) isn't working as it should had
[12:21:16] <pm83> !lista
[12:21:43] <Ghan> jQuery("img[src='small_image.jpg']").addClass('test'); why isn't this adding that class to images with that img src?
[12:22:49] <smalldevil> Bye
[12:23:00] <smalldevil> Noboady is helping me here
[12:23:03] <smalldevil> Thanks
[12:24:15] <igcewieling> smalldevil: I get that too.  Sometimes it means you are asking a dumb question, or the answer to your question is so complicated nobody wants to spend time on it.
[12:24:56] <smalldevil> so which is mine
[12:25:06] <igcewieling> smalldevil: No idea.
[12:25:10] <smalldevil> dumb or complicated
[12:25:16] <ajpiano> smalldevil: please make a demo of your code failing on jsfiddle.net
[12:25:19] <Taktaal> impossible to debug without the context
[12:25:20] <igcewieling> I've never used on().
[12:25:39] <smalldevil> Me too
[12:25:42] <igcewieling> smalldevil: if it is any consolation nobody answered my questions either
[12:25:53] <smalldevil> Someone else here suggested me to use it instead
[12:26:01] <igcewieling> (not to day at least, usually I get great help here)
[12:27:06] <ajpiano> ah, smalldevil, i see the problem i think
[12:27:16] <smalldevil> See I have a element which is hidden when user clicks anywhere on the page except navigational links
[12:27:25] <bartmax> ajpiano: how can i get the first matching object with an internal property.
[12:27:26] <ajpiano> the problem with saying "a click on anything that's not an a" is that when you click an a, it bubbles up to its parent
[12:27:26] <bartmax> ?
[12:27:27] <smalldevil> I do I put this together
[12:27:27] <Ghan> anybody? jQuery("img[src='small_image.jpg']").addClass('test');
[12:27:39] <smalldevil> I tried not() function
[12:28:11] <igcewieling> Ghan: (3:18:40 PM) caniuse: doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[12:28:24] <bartmax> ajpiano: something like : $(obj).each(function() { if (obj.id == matchingId) { return obj.value } });
[12:28:48] <bartmax> ajpiano: jquery will map or something like that do that ?
[12:29:28] <Ghan> jQuery("img[src='small_image.jpg']").addClass('test');

[12:30:54] <bartmax> ajpiano: ty
[12:31:42] <bartmax> ringotwo: GREAT!! why not computed?
[12:31:42] <ajpiano> bartmax: are we talking about a jquery object here or just a regular object
[12:31:49] <bartmax> ajpiano: regular object
[12:31:50] <ajpiano> $(elems).filter(function() { return obj.id == matchingId; })
[12:31:53] <ajpiano> bartmax: uhhh
[12:31:56] <ringotwo> it's not really a computed value, i don't think
[12:32:06] <ajpiano> you have an object and you want to do whatnow
[12:32:11] <bartmax> ringotwo: there's a select/combo that change the symbol
[12:32:17] <ringotwo> you're just looking up a value in one array based on a value in a different array
[12:32:21] <ajpiano> bartmax: you have an array of objects?
[12:32:24] <mikkelb> I got this webapp that sometimes gives me these notices: http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/ZQJNV/ - what's the best way of hiding them after 3 seconds whenever they appear?

[12:32:50] <bartmax> im wondering if there's a function in jQuery for that
[12:32:55] <ringotwo> i would test it, it's probably not gonna work without some debugging

[12:35:24] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/ZQJNV/ - how do I slideUp() .notice after 3 seconds has passed? I've written some of it though...
[12:35:27] <ch3mical> >>[true,false].forEach(function(a) { [a,!a].forEach(function(b) { [b,!b].forEach(function(c) { console.log(a,b,c) }) }) })
[12:35:39] <ch3mical> I thought you could log?
[12:36:29] <friedbyte> is there a way to add inner wrapper to the body element?
[12:36:35] <jeffsmykil_> ajpiano: you know of a way to have multiple themes for Chosen?
[12:36:41] <ajpiano> nope
[12:36:47] <ajpiano> probably um, CSS.
[12:36:53] <jeffsmykil_> well yes
[12:37:02] <jeffsmykil_> but the classes are hardcoded in the js
[12:37:15] <jeffsmykil_> and if i need two on one page
[12:37:19] <jeffsmykil_> with diferent styles Im SOL
[12:37:35] <ajpiano> my heart goes out to you
[12:37:40] <ch3mical> >>z=[]; [true,false].forEach(function(a) { [a,!a].forEach(function(b) { [b,!b].forEach(function(c) { z.push([a,b,c]) }) }) }); z
[12:37:49] <ajpiano> it's pretty much impossible to use javascript to dynamically change the classes of the elements later on, natch
[12:37:51] <jeffsmykil_> ajpiano: that's all I can sk for
[12:38:11] <jeffsmykil_> ajpiano: your heart
[12:38:21] <ch3mical> Oh wrong bot :)
[12:38:29] <lenswipe>  guys
[12:38:30] <lenswipe> hey guys*
[12:38:36] <jeffsmykil_> ajpiano: did you just break my sarcasm meter?
[12:38:53] <lenswipe> if i have a list of <a> tags, is there a way to tell which one was clicked in jquery without giving each one an ID?
[12:39:00] <lenswipe> can in query the DOM or something to find out?
[12:40:33] <ajpiano> lenswipe: what
[12:40:51] <ajpiano> you can bind an event and then the element reference will be handed to you as 'this' and 'event.target'
[12:40:54] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil_: possibly
[12:41:00] <lenswipe> ajcates, how do i do that?
[12:41:03] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/ZQJNV/ - how do I hide .notice after 3 seconds? I'm almost there!
[12:41:27] <ajpiano> lenswipe: um $("a").on("click", function(e) { console.log(this); });
[12:41:29] <jeffsmykil_> last time i buy a sarcasm meter at skymall
[12:41:35] <lenswipe> ajcates, thanks
[12:41:57] <lenswipe> ajcates, could i bind a whole class of elements? or does it have to just be each individual element?
[12:42:29] <ajpiano> ...
[12:42:38] <ajpiano> lenswipe: haven't you been using jquery for like, a bit
[12:42:43] <ajpiano> lenswipe: $(".foo")
[12:42:47] <lenswipe> yeah i know
[12:42:51] <lenswipe> im just asking if that would work?
[12:42:54] <ajpiano> then why are you asking me
[12:43:06] <lenswipe> see above
[12:43:12] <jeffsmykil_> personally I just like the one on one attention ajpiano
[12:43:18] * lenswipe smacks ajpiano with a keyboard
[12:43:18] <lenswipe> :p
[12:43:28] <ajpiano> lenswipe: you know that jquery works by selecting elements and then performing actions to all of them
[12:43:34] <lenswipe> nevermind
[12:43:39] <ajpiano> ..
[12:43:40] <ajpiano> ok
[12:44:15] <lenswipe> how do i prevent a link from clicking?
[12:44:23] <lenswipe> nevrmind
[12:44:23] <Zzaichik> heh
[12:44:28] <ajpiano> e.preventDefault()
[12:44:53] <jeffsmykil_> or return false;
[12:44:53] <jeffsmykil_> i believe
[12:45:25] <jeffsmykil_> but I've been known to be horribly horribly wrong in the past
[12:45:27] <ajpiano> return false calls event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation()
[12:45:32] <ajpiano> so yes, kinda.
[12:46:27] <jeffsmykil_> that's as good as I'm not wrong
[12:48:16] <nFFF> ajpiano, can you give a case of when youd want preventdefault but not stoppropagation
[12:48:44] <ajpiano> you don't want the default action of the event but you do want it to keep propgating to be handled at higher levels?
[12:49:26] <nFFF> have you an example so I can understand, when do you want propogation to occurre I guess
[12:49:45] <ajpiano> it's common for a given thing to need to stop an element from doing its default action (following an anchor) but it's not reasonable for that to mean you have a black hole in your event delegation
[12:49:55] <ajpiano> like if you have your own delegation on the entire document for one thing
[12:50:07] <ajpiano> but a plugin that calls preventDefault on something inside of it
[12:50:32] <nFFF> yea I don't fully understand propogation or when its useful
[12:50:33] <ajpiano> sometimes you get a situation where delegate on the document will stop working, cause the plugin used return false and stopped event from propgating to doc
[12:50:47] <ajpiano> propagation is what underpins the very notion of event delegation
[12:51:04] <nFFF> but you bind to a parent and delegate down
[12:51:24] <nFFF> I can see the need for that all the time, with dynamic content being added to DOM etc
[12:51:24] <ajpiano> right
[12:51:28] <ajpiano> but the way it *gets* to the parent
[12:51:32] <nFFF> not so much the other way round
[12:51:33] <ajpiano> is by it propagating UP to it
[12:51:50] <nFFF> Ah
[12:51:56] <nFFF> sorry I understand now
[12:52:14] <ajpiano> great!
[12:52:49] <Whirl3dOrd3r> Hey all. Quick question about setTimeout...when I use var timer=setTimeout(showNext, 3000, gallery)....will gallery be passed to the showNext function when it is called?
[12:53:04] <ajpiano> nope
[12:53:33] <Whirl3dOrd3r> i didn't think it would. but what is the extra parameter used for in setTimeout...or did I hallucinate that..
[12:53:47] <ajpiano> "lateness"
[12:55:04] <igcewieling> I'm using $('.tab.).show();  Is there any way to run a function when a specific element with the "tab" class is shown or hiden?  I can't use a callback to .show() because it would run on ALL the elements, not just the one I want to run it on.
[12:55:44] <ajpiano> you can put conditional logic inside of the callbac
[12:55:44] <nFFF> ajpiano, so when do you use stoppropogation?
[12:55:49] <igcewieling> If there isn't a way the only other way I can think of is leave the function running ALL the time and simply exit if the element to update is not shown.
[12:56:07] <ajpiano> or filter the thing to be the thing you want
[12:56:23] <nFFF> Actually got it
[12:56:24] <nFFF> nvmd
[12:56:35] <nFFF> if you don't want an event bubbling to the parent, use it then
[12:56:41] <ajpiano> nFFF: when you want to explicitly make sure the event doesn't propagate
[12:56:43] <igcewieling> ajpiano: I had not thought of that.  It is not exactly what I was looking for, but a simple search of all my .show() should not be tough to do.
[12:56:56] <igcewieling> simple search and replace that is
[12:57:06] <ajpiano> you hadn't thought of "only applying the thing to the thing you wanted to apply it to?"
[12:57:20] <ajpiano> nFFF: for instance in the demo i made for that guy before http://jsfiddle.net/MJyuS/4/
[12:57:46] <ajpiano> nFFF: if you don't stop propagation, the event goes from being a click on an anchor, to eventually being a click on document or some other intermediate element
[12:57:53] <ajpiano> and gets handled there
[12:58:18] <igcewieling> ajpiano: correct.  I was stuck in the mindset of things like .form where you set up the submit at the beginning.
[12:58:33] <ajpiano> good thing that's over!
[12:59:50] <ajpiano> nFFF: actually the way i ended up with there, the stopProp isn't necessary
[13:00:11] <ajpiano> nFFF: it's the kind of thing you just nkow when you need - the first part to figuring that out is just knowing there's a difference and be aware of it
[13:00:16] <ajpiano> instead of just blindly doing return false;
[13:00:35] <saimon69^work> hewllo there, did anybody ever tried to add events to a pinterest pin it! button?
[13:00:49] <nFFF> ajpiano
[13:00:50] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/MJyuS/5/
[13:01:09] <nFFF> IS this not the same solution without the need?
[13:01:16] <ajpiano> that's an insane solution
[13:01:29] <jrockjiggz> I have a rather complicated site that may/may not break under heavy load.. is there some sort of stress test i can create? also, would anyone know of some expert service where my site's core archetect could be reviewed?
[13:01:44] <Whirl3dOrd3r> ajpiano, I was looking for the specs for setTimeout and came across this user post{ In "modern" browsers setTimeout can provide function parameters directly as follows: setTimeout (alert, 5000, "Alert message");The string will be passed to the alert function when it is called in 5 seconds.)
[13:02:26] <nFFF> ah wait yes sorry total different thing, then your code
[13:02:54] <nFFF> Ive never used click events like that before
[13:03:20] <nFFF> Only ever used them directly binded or delegated to an element
[13:09:32] <nFFF> ajpiano, but why in that example would you ever bind ambigiously like that
[13:09:38] <nFFF> and not specificaly to the span
[13:09:50] <ajpiano> that's what that guy asked for
[13:10:00] <ajpiano> any click anywhere in the document besides a given set of anchors
[13:10:52] <ajpiano> nFFF: there's not much point in stopping propagation on an event on the document, cause it's already bubbled up all the way
[13:11:40] <nFFF> Yea I just havent used it or seen it much, so struggling to see the case where you need it, where theres not a better way of desinging your software
[13:11:54] <ajpiano> what
[13:11:57] <nFFF> Infact I don't think Ive ever seen it used :<
[13:12:11] <ajpiano> $(document).on("click", ".foo", fn) ?
[13:12:50] <nFFF> yea..
[13:13:07] <ajpiano> that's the same thing as $(".foo").live("click", fn);
[13:13:49] <nFFF> yes
[13:14:05] <nFFF> but where is stoppropagation expicitly called?
[13:14:22] <ajpiano> it wouldn't be when you're delegating on the document
[13:14:30] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/MJyuS/6/ is what i would do
[13:14:34] <ajpiano> it more happens when you are catching event on a lower point in the dom
[13:15:18] <nFFF> Yea just never seen it explicily called before
[13:15:42] <ajpiano> nFFF: he didn't say "i want a click event on the span" he said "a click event on anything that isn't a nav anchor"
[13:15:49] <ajpiano> this doesn't even work if you click on the div
[13:15:50] <ajpiano> anyway
[13:16:54] <nFFF> Yea sorry totally misunderstood what he wanted to do
[13:16:59] <nFFF> thanks for the insight
[13:21:03] <microhxo> is it possible to ignore all clicks in the first TH if the user is not clicking a checkbox?
[13:28:41] <nFFF> ajpiano, wow, ignore everything I said in the past 15 minutes :D got major confused for some reason
[13:28:46] <nFFF> :|
[13:29:53] <bartmax> format a date string like /Date(1331315172000)/ ?
[13:38:24] <mats_> can anyone see what's wrong with this? it doesn't fadeOut and it worked earlier, i love this mysterious things haha: http://jsfiddle.net/H76sP/
[13:38:32] <mats_> these
[13:42:25] <nFFF> mats_
[13:42:39] <nFFF> why doesn't it work, its useless without your markup
[13:44:17] <Emn1ty> can you guys beat this thing up a bit? http://vehicleinventorynetwork.com/ja/graph/graphV2.php
[13:44:36] <nFFF> mats_ check your last selector, what are you trying to select/
[13:46:20] <mats_> nFFF:  of course… should be .lid, must've changed it by accident and saved the document
[13:46:23] <mats_> thanks
[13:51:20] <lenswipe> ajpiano, do you know if its possible to send additional data back with a form using jquery?
[13:51:27] <lenswipe> data thats not in the form
[13:51:35] <ajpiano> yep
[13:51:44] <ajpiano> are you doing an ajax post or just want to do a standard post but augment the data
[13:52:02] <lenswipe> probably standard post with augmented data
[13:52:20] <ajpiano> lenswipe: in a submit handler, dynamically append some hidden inputs to the form
[13:52:30] <lenswipe> mk
[13:52:34] <lenswipe> ajpiano, https://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/#kesldr4/GTWuU8
[13:52:54] <lenswipe> ive got that form there
[13:53:25] <lenswipe> youll notice the person picker under "Who" isnt an actual form element, therefore i cant actually capture data from it using a form - therefore i need to use javascript in order to do that
[13:54:25] <ajpiano> whaaat
[13:54:44] <lenswipe> ajpiano, see the link i sent you
[13:54:54] <ajpiano> yeah i'm looking at it, i have no effing idea what this is
[13:54:54] <ajpiano> lol
[13:55:09] <lenswipe> well see where it says "Who?"
[13:55:22] <ajpiano> right
[13:55:39] <lenswipe> well that needs to be part of my form except its not a proper form element
[13:55:56] <lenswipe> hence my need to manipulate the post data when the form is submitted
[13:56:01] <ajpiano> what the heck is mockingbird
[13:56:07] <lenswipe> mock up application
[13:56:09] <lenswipe> its really cool
[13:56:11] <ajpiano> ask them
[13:56:20] <ajpiano> how to reverse engineer their thing
[13:56:35] <lenswipe> ajpiano, why?
[13:56:44] <ajpiano> cause no one here is gonna know how to do it
[13:56:47] <nibblebot> how can i get $(els).val() to return an array of val's? instead of just the val of first matched?
[13:57:03] <ajpiano> lenswipe: i'm in "preview mode" maybe i have a different thing than you
[13:57:08] <ajpiano> nibblebot: use .map
[13:57:13] <lenswipe> ajpiano, what the eff are you on about?
[13:57:14] <nibblebot> k
[13:57:18] <nibblebot> was thinking that
[13:57:20] <ajpiano> $(".foo").map(function() { return $(this).val() }).get()
[13:57:30] <imsky> .get()?
[13:57:31] <lenswipe> ajpiano, its a mock up application, im trying to show you a drawing of what im trying to code - mockingbird has nothing to do with my problem
[13:57:54] <ajpiano> lenswipe: why wouldn't you put the input elements in an actual <form>
[13:58:05] <ajpiano> imsky: otherwise you get a jQuery wrapped array of strings
[13:58:06] <ajpiano> :|
[13:58:16] <imsky> lol
[13:58:24] <lenswipe> ajpiano, see on that link i sent you?
[13:58:26] <Emn1ty> lenswipe: you should wireframe this out and send us the actual elements if you don't want us to be confused.
[13:58:27] <imsky> write less, do more!
[13:58:36] <lenswipe> Emn1ty, I FUCKING DID!
[13:58:41] <lenswipe> *SCREAM*
[13:58:43] <ajpiano> lenswipe: in html
[13:58:51] <imsky> whoa calm down there
[13:58:52] <ajpiano> asking people how to get something to work
[13:59:00] <lenswipe> Emn1ty, i sent the link to the wireframe to ajpiano - he apparently doesnt know what wireframing is
[13:59:11] <ajpiano> lenswipe: i don't know how to assume the html structure of your wireframe
[13:59:17] <ajpiano> and i don't know why you wouldn't put form elements inside a form
[13:59:19] <lenswipe> <ajpiano> ask them
[13:59:20] <lenswipe> <ajpiano> how to reverse engineer their thing
[13:59:20] <Emn1ty> lenswipe: you are sending us a thumbnail
[13:59:24] <lenswipe> <lenswipe> ajpiano, why?
[13:59:27] <Emn1ty> lenswipe: not a wireframe
[13:59:28] <lenswipe> Emn1ty, huh?
[13:59:34] <ajpiano> lenswipe: i thought you were trying to do something in mockingbird
[13:59:48] <lenswipe> ajpiano, ....no.
[13:59:49] <ajpiano> lenswipe: drop the attitude and realise that people do not have the magical knowledge of what you've been working on for however long
[13:59:57] <imsky> ajpiano: just tested it, .get isn't required. is this browser-specific?
[14:00:01] <lenswipe> ajpiano, its a wireframe - whats hard to grasp about that?
[14:00:04] <ajpiano> imsky: nope
[14:00:10] <lenswipe> Emn1ty, um its a wireframe?
[14:00:23] <ajpiano> lenswipe: you are asing me how to do something in js and html and showing me a bunch of lines
[14:00:25] <imsky> ajpiano: well jquery doesn't wrap the strings. so...good for it?
[14:00:28] <ajpiano> it doesn't help
[14:00:29] <Emn1ty> lenswipe: a wireframe is usually the html+css layout of the page
[14:00:37] <lenswipe> Emn1ty, i know what it is
[14:00:52] <lenswipe> Emn1ty, how about if i show you what im seeing when i click the link and you can tell me if you see that too?
[14:00:56] <Emn1ty> lenswipe: then why does it look like a pdf?
[14:01:10] <ajpiano> lenswipe: i thin i nkow what you mean
[14:01:13] <alexfreewalker> hello
[14:01:18] <imsky> ajpiano: either way now that i think about it, why did you think jquery wraps the strings? the $ function returns an array, that array can be mapped however possible
[14:01:42] <ajpiano> lenswipe: you would just traverse the DOM structure of the person picker
[14:01:42] <lenswipe> ajpiano, Emn1ty http://imagebin.org/202671
[14:01:44] <ajpiano> inside of a submit
[14:01:44] <alexfreewalker> where can I post some code so someone can take a look at it im noob -_-
[14:01:53] <lenswipe> ajpiano, exactly
[14:02:03] <ajpiano> lenswipe: you could use .map as well
[14:02:04] <lenswipe> ajpiano, Emn1ty, thats what i see when i click the link
[14:02:11] <lenswipe> ajpiano, what is .map?
[14:02:23] <ajpiano> it's a method that goes over an array and returns a different array
[14:02:27] <lenswipe> ok
[14:02:43] <ajpiano> $(".personPickerItems").map(function() { return {name: $(this).find(".name")};  });
[14:02:45] <ajpiano> something like that
[14:03:03] <lenswipe> ajpiano, thanks
[14:03:56] <ajpiano> imsky: i got that idea because it does :)
[14:03:58] <ajpiano> imsky: http://jsbin.com/azobez/2/edit
[14:04:13] <ajpiano> imsky: $("foo").map(fn) returns a jquery object
[14:04:18] <lenswipe> thanks ajcates Emn1ty
[14:04:20] <lenswipe> ajpiano, *
[14:04:21] <ajpiano> which happens to look identical to an array in chrome inspector
[14:04:30] <alexfreewalker> where can I post some code so someone can take a look at it?
[14:04:33] <ajpiano> cause chrome inspector prints anything with a splice method and a length property as an array
[14:04:35] <ajpiano> ?p @ alexfreewalker
[14:04:36] <Emn1ty> lenswipe: its a static generation of layout. Its not a wireframe. Either way, the point is we can't interact with it or see the actual dom structure. Thus throwing us off and making it difficult to help with actual interface behavior. I also don't know what you mean by "being part of a form but not a proper form element" without said dom structure.
[14:04:36] <bot-t> alexfreewalker, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/

[14:08:03] <imsky> i need ajax becuz of the live tho
[14:08:07] <gehsekky> lol
[14:08:08] <alexfreewalker> lol
[14:08:59] <alexfreewalker> it contains each, so its hard to get it workin with live
[14:09:36] <imsky> that's some derpy js
[14:09:40] <Emn1ty> ajpiano: I ended up working on that for several weeks but it does what's needed and i learned a ton of javascript as a result
[14:09:40] <gehsekky> haha
[14:10:03] <ajpiano> alexfreewalker: you don't need .each() to begin with regardless of how you're doing it, and you don't need "live because it's ajax"
[14:10:12] <ajpiano> you need to use event delegation because of the fact that it's coming from ajax
[14:10:15] <ajpiano> and that's what .on does
[14:10:21] <ajpiano> alexfreewalker: i'm making an example for you

[14:13:02] <Pilate> It should animate fine with a latest version, that should only happen with rAF
[14:13:42] <saschagehlich> so things changed from 1.7 to 1.7.1 regarding this?
[14:13:54] <ajpiano> saschagehlich: no, it all happened during 1.6 cycle
[14:14:40] <saschagehlich> hm well then this is weird. is there something you can do wrong so that this happens?
[14:16:41] <phil-adept> Can anyone recomend any 'basic' jquery file upload plugins? Ideally none requiring iFrames or .swf's. Multiple files NOT required nor is upload progress
[14:16:58] <nFFF> ajpiano, another question regarding map, I always see .each used but rarely map
[14:17:01] <m8_nb> Hi i can filter object by a set of matched objects?
[14:17:14] <ajpiano> ?g when to use jquery's map methods ajpiano @ nFFF
[14:17:15] <bot-t> nFFF, When To Use jQuery's .map Methods - adam j. sontag - http://ajpiano.com/when-to-use-jquerys-map-methods/
[14:17:21] <nFFF> are they interchangable (I know they don't provide the exact same functionality)
[14:17:25] <nFFF> ok thanks
[14:17:30] <ajpiano> no, they aren't interchangable
[14:17:52] <nFFF> Not in a literal sense
[14:17:54] <ajpiano> alexfreewalker: this is *not* guaranateed to work for your app
[14:18:14] <nFFF> but whenevr I thought of using map, I always thought of a way it could be done with each :>
[14:18:23] <ajpiano> but it should  show you how to get started, http://jsfiddle.net/CkYd3/4/ alexfreewalker
[14:18:41] <alexfreewalker> imsky r u here?
[14:18:48] <ajpiano> nFFF: yeah, obvs, cause you can just push into an array inside of a loop... but why do that when map is tighter
[14:19:02] <alexfreewalker> ajpiano thanks :)
[14:19:13] <ajpiano> alexfreewalker: if it doesn't work, add your html to the fiddle and experiement further
[14:19:55] <alexfreewalker> ajpiano thanks a lot, let me try it
[14:20:14] <alexfreewalker> so whats the difference between on and live?
[14:20:27] <ajpiano> as of jquery 1.7, live is just an alias to .on
[14:20:46] <ajpiano> on is much more explicit about what it does
[14:20:52] <ajpiano> than the magical semantics of .live
[14:21:05] <alexfreewalker> thanks again
[14:21:36] <nFFF> good read thanks ajpiano, I've seen a lot of cases in here where each was used, where map would have been better
[14:21:56] <ajpiano> nFFF: yep. map is much neater, but people who are newer just don't know what it's for so they do push in a loop
[14:23:20] <alexfreewalker> do you guys know what should i take into consideration to make IE8 and below work with jquery as it should be, cuz i find this son of a b*** buggy
[14:27:15] <nFFF> Yea map is cool, definately hard for beginners to grasp
[14:27:26] <nFFF> this is how I previously would have done your last one: http://jsfiddle.net/H76sP/1/
[14:27:55] <nFFF> I guess you literally have to learn if arrays use map
[14:28:17] <phil-adept> Anyone?...
[14:28:28] <phil-adept> I'm looking for recomendations for any 'basic' jquery file upload plugins? Ideally none requiring iFrames or .swf's. Multiple files NOT required nor is upload progress
[14:28:33] <nFFF> phil-adept, cant you google?
[14:28:41] <nFFF> surely theres some on there
[14:31:00] <phil-adept> nFFF, I have googled... I was looking for recomendations based on experience... You don't really have a field in google for that....
[14:32:03] <nFFF> stackoverflow is a good resource
[14:32:10] <phil-adept> nFFF or unless I'm missing the "I can't be arsed searching myself so I'll go into a chatroom and ask people just to get condicending replies from presumptuous users" option in here?...
[14:32:41] <nFFF> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1663741/is-there-a-good-jquery-drag-and-drop-file-upload-plugin
[14:33:30] <nFFF> http://smashingweb.ge6.org/jquery-plugin-for-html5-file-upload/
[14:33:51] <phil-adept> nFFF, Let me put it simply. I've 3 blog posts open, each offering a minimum of 8 plugins each. Uploadify is great, however we can't use swf. Clientside the browser will be ie7 so we can't use HTML5 either. I popped in here hoping someone would have a tool they have used over and over (for personal reasons) that could recommend.
[14:34:29] <phil-adept> We can't install PECL packages on the server either so we know we can't have upload progress
[14:35:35] <nFFF> Time to get coding :D
[14:36:13] <alexfreewalker> ajpiano your code didn't work, I managed to make it work this way http://jsfiddle.net/4FfSe/
[14:37:05] <yedimind> yeah, ajpiano, your code don't work!
[14:37:16] <phil-adept> sorry, nFFF, sorry for the attitude, I was banging my head against a brick wall before coming on here so I came in with a chip on my shoulder. Normally your response of "google it" would have made me laugh as believe me (as opposed to 90% of quireies, I did goggle, download and evaluate 4 options and each of them have been rejected for reasons explained in my spec requirements). I appologise
[14:37:16] <phil-adept> if I was terse, and thanks for helping
[14:37:50] <ajpiano> phil-adept: what's wrong with iframe
[14:38:16] <ajpiano> the jquery form plugin does  simple iframe transport when it finds a file input
[14:38:19] <ajpiano> and uploads like normal
[14:39:57] <mikkelb> At https://gist.github.com/1992835 - I have some JS that knows whether a user has selected the radio "Yes I have a password, continue to regular checkout", or the "No, I don't, continue to guest checkout". Like this: http://i.imgur.com/aXE4V.png
[14:40:01] <mikkelb> I get the feeling though that the JS is way more complicated than it has to be - can anybody think of ways to maybe simplify it?
[14:42:59] <nFFF> ajpiano how do bocoup get make money?
[14:43:25] <nFFF> Im on there site now, but they work on open source technologies, how does this pay?
[14:43:48] <ajpiano> "Client Projects Below is a selection of our commercial consulting work."
[14:44:55] <Emn1ty> I want to blow this music player away so badly.
[14:45:03] <nFFF> Do you ever work privately on commercial projects?
[14:45:09] <ajpiano> yes
[14:46:17] <akahn> how do I make a CSV AJAX request on 1.4.2? :(
[14:46:51] <alexfreewalker> is there a way to run a function after page finished loading form a load() function?
[14:47:38] <Taktaal> akahn, you can pick how to
[14:48:09] <Taktaal> make your page do an AJAX request to /getinfo/csv/24242 if you want csv
[14:48:41] <Taktaal> and parse the path on the script that does the AJAX response
[14:49:02] <akahn> no, I meant, for real. with accepts headers.
[14:49:14] <akahn> boo, why doesn't this deep merge http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L6cKvcOkpSk/TMa1oSSuYkI/AAAAAAAABlE/lQC6i_7frIE/s1600/hugh-jackman-wolverine.jpg
[14:49:15] <phil-adept> ajpiano: no iFrames on client request. And believe me that was the response I got... A simple 'no'... Think I'm stuck on this one lol
[14:49:16] <Taktaal> csv if text/plain
[14:49:19] * phil-adept hates clients
[14:50:07] <ajpiano> phil-adept: are you sure the client understands the difference beteween using an iframe in the actual design
[14:50:15] <ajpiano> vs to achieve a particular technical end like a file upload
[14:50:53] <blendedbychris> doesanyonek now how to access the vimeo api with jquery?
[14:53:36] <phil-adept> It's 23:00 on a Friday, my lady is waiting for me to finish work ...gutted
[14:53:52] <phil-adept> ajpiano: I'm not sure I fully understand the reason behind it to be fair
[14:55:45] <rroelofs> so is your client going to read the code?  You could always add the iframe using js...
[14:56:09] <alexfreewalker> its 1AM
[14:56:18] <rroelofs> where you are...
[14:56:26] <alexfreewalker> Israel
[14:56:43] <nFFF> rroelofs :DD
[14:56:44] <alexfreewalker> u?
[14:57:12] <rroelofs> Time is much more interesting when we all live on different continents
[14:58:33] <phil-adept> What is the requirement of the iframe?
[14:59:09] <Emn1ty> rroelofs: just wait till we are a space fairing people. Time here vs. time on a Saturn moon will be completely non-relational.
[14:59:18] <alexfreewalker> i live in the future :MeGusta:
[14:59:34] <rroelofs> Yup.  and we think it's tough now!
[14:59:45] <Emn1ty> I just ignore time zones at this point.
[14:59:49] <Taktaal> uhm time on a saturn moon is almost running at the same speed
[15:00:04] <Taktaal> there's just a huge ping between us
[15:00:10] <Emn1ty> taktaal: except the experience of what time it is there will be different.
[15:00:33] <starsinmypockets> recommendation for a jquery rotating banner...
[15:00:34] <starsinmypockets> ?
[15:00:53] <nFFF> how? you don't experience time, it's just a measurement of events
[15:01:00] <Emn1ty> taktaal: what an hour, day, month, week, year are etc
[15:01:06] <phil-adept> starsinmypockets I've used jqeurytools-slider before. That's nice
[15:02:30] <bitwise_> hi-im animating something inside a click handler, but i'd like to not animate if the item is already animating. i cant seem to get it to work.. tried .filter(":not(:animated)") but its still queuing
[15:02:53] <phil-adept> starsinmypockets: I tend to write a basic one when I need to. They aren't hard and they can be more lightweight and tailored to suit
[15:03:24] <starsinmypockets> phil-adept... sounds about right... you have any code you could share?
[15:04:49] <bitwise_> the trick with this is i am using .delay(3000).animate(...)
[15:05:24] <nFFF> bitwise_, don't think :animated is a valid selector
[15:05:45] <bitwise_> http://api.jquery.com/animated-selector/
[15:05:52] <sphinxxx> whats the best way to "cancel" an ajax request, if it's taking too long
[15:06:03] <nFFF> oh ok :>
[15:06:38] <bitwise_> i wish there was a delay option for the animate properties
[15:07:23] <starsinmypockets> bitwise_ can't you use setTimeout()
[15:12:36] <phil-adept> starsinmypockets: the most basic of methods is simple. You creat a ul within your markup. each slide is an wrapped within an li element. In your css define the dimensions of the ul to be the same as one slide. Float your li elements and set the overflow on your ul to hide li elements out of the 'viewport'. Position the ul / li's relative / absolute and use jquery to adjust the css:left using
[15:12:36] <phil-adept> animate() etc :D
[15:14:27] <blendedbychris> someone help a brother out… how the crap does this twork?? https://github.com/vimeo/player-api/blob/master/javascript/playground.html
[15:14:31] <starsinmypockets> phil-adept - excellent, thanks... I'll try my hand at it..
[15:14:56] <phil-adept> starsinmypockets: np's bud. Any issues give me a shout
[15:15:13] <starsinmypockets> cheers!
[15:16:04] <ajpiano> phil-adept: normal ajax can't send a file
[15:16:12] <ajpiano> so the iframe technique creates an iframe on the fly
[15:16:20] <ajpiano> with the src of the script you post to
[15:16:29] <ajpiano> and posts it to that window
[15:16:40] <ajpiano> and then when it's done doing it's thing, it gives you the response of the page
[15:16:44] <ajpiano> so it feels the same as ajax
[15:16:46] <phil-adept> getcha, kinda like a self posting form?
[15:16:47] <ajpiano> it just works for file uploads
[15:16:50] <ajpiano> something like that
[15:17:02] <ajpiano> https://github.com/malsup/form
[15:17:10] <ajpiano> it just takes care of it for you automagically though
[15:17:15] <phil-adept> right, does this iframe need to appear on page or just within the runtime markup?
[15:17:21] <ajpiano> so it's like, if the clieent is non technical they won't even know it's there
[15:17:24] <ajpiano> not at all
[15:18:15] <ajpiano> it's not like, there's an iframe in the page that the user sees
[15:18:16] <phil-adept> I'm presuming throughout JS execution it creats an iframe element (the form to upload the files) and is that injected into the DOM?
[15:18:22] <phil-adept> right ok
[15:18:28] <ajpiano> yes,
[15:18:32] <ajpiano> you can read the source :)
[15:18:40] <phil-adept> ah ok
[15:18:45] <ajpiano> https://github.com/malsup/form/blob/master/jquery.form.js
[15:19:10] <wookiehangover> ajpiano: but reading is hard
[15:19:29] <ajpiano> ?mlm
[15:19:29] <bot-t> much like myself
[15:19:53] <phil-adept> ah ok. Fallsback to the XHR object for ie. Nice
[15:20:55] <bitwise_> I just call clearQueue() on the element when clicked and it works ok
[15:21:06] <bitwise_> (to answer my own question)
[15:23:26] <alexfreewalker> how can you reload js file after ajax finishes?
[15:23:27] <Whirl3dOrd3r> in the statement $(menu).on({click:function (e) { var targ=$(e.target); console.log(targ.attrib("id"));......I'm getting the error that objectObject has not method attrib... what am I doing wrong?
[15:24:10] <bitwise_> alexfreewalker: remove and rebuild the script element?
[15:24:38] <ajpiano> Whirl3dOrd3r: ...
[15:24:39] <akahn> how can I make an ajax response open the file download pane?
[15:24:56] <ajpiano> Whirl3dOrd3r: it's attr
[15:25:04] <akahn> the response is sending the correct content-disposition header
[15:25:10] <ajpiano> akahn: you can't. you have to window.open the page and serve the file back with content disposition headers
[15:25:14] <ajpiano> ah
[15:25:20] <ajpiano> yeah window.open it
[15:25:24] <Whirl3dOrd3r> wow. I have been working on this for about 38 hours straight. Sorry to waste your time. THanks for the help.
[15:25:30] <akahn> ok. that makes the last hour of my life pointless. thanks again ajpiano
[15:25:40] <ajpiano> no prob
[15:27:02] <akahn> for ruining my life
[15:27:21] <ajpiano> no prob
[15:28:30] <alexfreewalker> bitwise_ what do u mean?
[15:31:08] <akahn> ajpiano: wait, does it actually open a new window???
[15:31:17] <akahn> if so that would suck
[15:31:20] <akahn> and i would hate you
[15:31:43] <ajpiano> for a hot second
[15:32:04] <akahn> that's kind of busted. just what our users like.
[15:32:14] <ajpiano> akahn: ask one of our hipster friend
[15:32:18] <ajpiano> friends*
[15:32:26] <ajpiano> afaik, that's The Way To Do It™
[15:32:27] <akahn> what
[15:32:42] <akahn> ajpiano: i can just let it be a link
[15:32:52] <ajpiano> true
[15:33:01] <akahn> but i need to tack on some parameters that the js app has accumulated
[15:34:12] <ajpiano> i wonder what happens if you open the content disposition page in an iframe
[15:34:17] <ajpiano> can't test
[15:34:19] <ajpiano> right now
[15:37:52] <akahn> ajpiano: cool http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2104764/Screenshots/wbup.png
[15:38:05] <akahn> i mean, ugly, but less ugly than some other things I was trying
[15:43:24] <raj> I thought putting something in $(function(){}) is equivalent to putting in $(document).ready?
[15:54:00] <blendedbychris> why am i getting left hand assignment errors?
[15:54:21] <blendedbychris> $this.hide();
[15:54:22] <blendedbychris> er

[15:58:21] <Azelphur> I'm learning the basics of jQuery, I've written some code that will query my game server, and show pictures for each player. My jQuery uses getJSON to get all the info, then sets the inside of a div to have the appropriate content, problem is that you can see it drawing each of the individual pictures for each player like it's looping, what would be the proper way to do this?
[16:06:57] <confounds> need someone to take a look at a resizing textarea & tell me if they'd use it
[16:20:21] <kenyabob> I'm looking for some cool form/ui inspiration that isn't that smashing mag stuff, anyone have any cool examples in their head
[16:21:06] <confounds> kenyabob what do you mean, isn't the smashing mag stuff
[16:21:39] <kenyabob> Stuff where the probably isn't a tutorial showing you how to do it on your site too
[16:25:47] <KeepSafe> Hi, i have my javascript file set up as such; http://ix.io/2cQ ; However, when i click a "navlink" element on the page, the click is not prevented, would this be an error in my use of javascript/jquery?
[16:26:38] <confounds> kenyabob you just want something that not everyone is already doing
[16:26:59] <kenyabob> confounds: sure
[16:29:43] <confounds> kenyabob i'd check out the sites where designers share inspiration, lots of stuff on those
[16:30:41] <kenyabob> confounds: any you like?
[16:31:54] <confounds> kenyabob haven't looked at any in a long time, a bunch came up when i googled 'designer inspiration sites' though
[16:34:34] <KeepSafe> Hi, i have my javascript file set up as such; http://ix.io/2cQ ; However, when i click a "navlink" element on the page, the click is not prevented, would this be an error in my use of javascript/jquery?
[16:36:58] <confounds> KeepSafe you mean the browser navigates to the page you're linking to?
[16:37:03] <KeepSafe> yes
[16:37:29] <confounds> i gotta bail but you'd probably need to post more code from your js & markup
[16:37:44] <KeepSafe> (which i would only want it to do if the user had javascript disabled)
[16:37:58] <KeepSafe> that is the entirety of my js so far
[16:38:41] <KeepSafe> my markup: http://ix.io/2cR
[16:38:52] <on3pk> Hey guys, I have a bit of an issue with a jquery menu
[16:39:20] <on3pk> http://wesupportronpaul.com/devel/demo.html  try hovering over "issues" :P
[16:41:37] <johnkpaul> on3pk: I see the problem, but do you have any more information on your issue?
[16:42:24] <on3pk> johnkpaul, what do you mean?
[16:42:56] <on3pk> I mean, what information do you want?
[16:43:02] <johnkpaul> saying "it's broken" doesn't really give enough information to help
[16:43:18] <johnkpaul> especially when menu.js has 4 lines of code that seem to have nothing to do with it
[16:44:03] <on3pk> Well, I think its a CSS issue, but, I'm using a terrible template.  Is there anything in javascript or jquery that would have the ul float above the rest of the content?
[16:44:28] <johnkpaul> oh, if it's a css issue, then you should try asking in #css
[16:44:52] <KeepSafe> on3pk: have you tried setting the z-index?
[16:45:16] <on3pk> I have, it doesn't seem to work :|
[16:45:24] <johnkpaul> I don't think it's a zindex probelm, the ul is not position absolute
[16:46:08] <johnkpaul> navigation_header > ul has css issues
[17:03:22] <KeepSafe> johnkpaul: would you have any idea what my problem could be?
[17:03:46] <johnkpaul> I didn't see you have any problem
[17:04:35] <KeepSafe> johnkpaul: have my javascript file set up as such; http://ix.io/2cQ ; However, when i click a "navlink" element on the page, the click is not prevented, would this be an error in my use of javascript/jquery?

[17:05:35] <johnkpaul> !domready @ KeepSafe
[17:05:42] <johnkpaul> ?domready @KeepSafe
[17:05:43] <bot-t> KeepSafe, $(document).ready( fn ), $( fn ) and $(document).bind( 'ready', fn ) are all equivalent and execute fn on "dom ready" (which executes before window onload). code that accesses the DOM will generally need to be wrapped in one of these. use the first one!
[17:06:18] <KeepSafe> i know that, but even when i used that, it seemed to make no difference
[17:08:19] <johnkpaul> that's surprising
[17:08:30] <johnkpaul> with the js that you have now, it's not really possible to work
[17:09:08] <KeepSafe> hmm, i realise that I may have been an idiot again, one moment please
[17:11:12] <on3pk> well, I guess, I have a problem (with the CSS issue dealt with) that jquery isn't keeping the menu open to reach options at the bottom
[17:18:56] <KeepSafe> johnkpaul: ok, seems that i made a silly mistake when using .ready()...
[17:19:26] <johnkpaul> glad you figured it out
[17:20:08] <KeepSafe> johnkpaul: yeah, but now, i cant seem to get the boxes to slide down on command
[17:23:17] <johnkpaul> hmm, what happens when you try
[17:25:30] <KeepSafe> johnkpaul: updated js: http://ix.io/2cS it seems to pass through both callbacks, but even though the correct id's seem to be being called, the elements are not unidden
[17:26:46] <johnkpaul> ?slideup @keepsafe
[17:26:46] <bot-t> keepsafe, .slideUp([duration], [callback]): Hide the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideUp/
[17:26:53] <johnkpaul> I think that your function arguments are incorrec
[17:27:26] <KeepSafe> the slideup s definatly correct
[17:27:51] <KeepSafe> i tested by disabling display: none in my css
[17:28:34] <KeepSafe> ohh, seemingly not anymore
[17:28:53] <gakins> I'm strugging a bit here.  I'm creating some "portlets" using JQuery sortable.  One of the icons I'm adding to these portlets shows a dialog.  When I execute the $('#dialog').dialog('open') the icons in the 'portlets' are "doubled"  https://gist.github.com/2009593
[17:33:03] <KeepSafe> johnkpaul: ok, now i have updated to make the callback into a fucntion, but how do i pass the id value to that function, because it wouldnt be in the scope, would it?
[17:33:38] <johnkpaul> ?closure @KeepSafe

[17:54:15] <on3pk> Ok, I got everything working
[17:55:05] <ijustam_> http://jsfiddle.net/gjdAL/ can someone explain why the ajaxStart isn't fired here?
[17:57:40] <ijustam_> http://jsfiddle.net/gjdAL/2/ less BS in the way in this version
[18:04:54] <jrockjiggz> ijustam_: Whenever an Ajax request is about to be sent, jQuery checks whether there are any other outstanding Ajax requests. If none are in progress, jQuery triggers the ajaxStart event. Any and all handlers that have been registered with the .ajaxStart() method are executed at this time.
[18:05:02] <epistax> Greets! I'm trying to find out if there's an easy way to extract information from an id in a bound function. I know I can do $("[id^='thingy_']") but I have no idea how I know that. What page talks about this syntax?
[18:05:52] <jrockjiggz> epistax: not sure if i follow you.. do you mean http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ ?
[18:06:38] <epistax> jrockjiggz, ahh yes that's it. I'm looking for a non-lame way to extract a piece out of that ID once I'm inside the event handler. I'll take a look. Thanks
[18:06:54] <ijustam_> jrockjiggz: isnt thats what happening?  except.. not?
[18:07:05] <jrockjiggz> ijustam_: an alternative solution http://jsfiddle.net/gjdAL/4/
[18:07:23] <ijustam_> someone else showed me that way, but im doing multiple requests at the same time
[18:07:28] <ijustam_> it fires off about 10 on button click
[18:07:54] <ijustam_> wouldnt that fire success() at the end of whichever responded first?
[18:08:29] <jrockjiggz> ijustam_: this is how i do it.. http://jsfiddle.net/gjdAL/5/
[18:11:34] <ijustam_> jrockjiggz: but if i fired off 5 of those in a for loop wouldnt that div hide after the first request?
[18:11:40] <ijustam_> leaving 4 still running after the div was hidden?
[18:12:18] <lenswipe> hi guys
[18:12:31] <lenswipe> how do i find out what item is selected in a <select >?
[18:12:49] <jrockjiggz> $('select').val()
[18:13:11] <lenswipe> i tried that
[18:13:15] <lenswipe> it just returns me "1"
[18:13:31] <ijustam_> i use $('#EmployeeDropDown option:selected').text();
[18:13:38] <lenswipe> k
[18:13:52] <jrockjiggz> ijustam_: check this out, i use it and makes life much better http://www.protofunc.com/scripts/jquery/ajaxManager/
[18:13:53] <ijustam_> i have no clue if thats the proper way to do it though
[18:14:00] <lenswipe> nevermind the first one worke
[18:14:01] <lenswipe> worked*
[18:14:04] <lenswipe> .val()
[18:14:05] <lenswipe> thank you
[18:14:29] <lenswipe> how do i appent things to post data?
[18:15:29] <jrockjiggz> things?
[18:15:51] <lenswipe> take things not in my form but that i have built controls for an append them to a form's post data
[18:16:05] <jrockjiggz> are you using ajax?
[18:16:21] <lenswipe> nope
[18:16:31] <lenswipe> well yes but not for the form post
[18:17:15] <jrockjiggz> $('form').attr('post', $(this).attr('post') + '&' + $('#otherDiv input').serialize() );
[18:17:31] <lenswipe> thx
[18:17:45] <jrockjiggz> if ajax.. then its easier, just $.ajax({ data: $(this).serizlize() })
[18:18:14] <lenswipe> jrockjiggz, lemme show you what im trying to do(cos i need advice on something else too
[18:19:09] <lenswipe> jrockjiggz, http://95.146.91.167/bootstraptest/dashboard/imagegrid
[18:38:57] <b0x> is there a function i can use find(). and each(). to select elements that contain a specific string?
[18:39:50] <b0x> for example, ive got a bunch of li's with various strings, need to return the li's that contain a string (as entered by a textfield)
[18:40:39] <b0x> .grep?
[18:42:22] <b0x> :contains
[19:02:29] <Pinchiukas> I'm not sure if this is a jQuery question but here goes: how do I increase the "left" CSS property of an item by say 5px if it's already 5px?
[19:02:51] <Pinchiukas> And I don't mean setting it to 10px, I mean increasing it by whatever value.
[19:03:22] <Joan> Specify it twice?
[19:03:23] <Pinchiukas> ball.css("left","+=50"); does not seem to work.
[19:03:36] <Joan> CSS is often cumulative.
[19:03:46] <Pinchiukas> Eh?
[19:04:11] <Joan> Well, at least it is with font-size:90% and such.
[19:04:21] <Joan> I assuem padding/margin can be manipulated in the same way.
[19:04:28] <Joan> assume
[19:04:52] <Pinchiukas> I didn't really understand what you meant.
[19:05:00] <jrockjiggz> well, if you want to move left, the el must have position: absolute
[19:05:24] <jrockjiggz> or, you can add .css({ marginLeft: '+=5px' })
[19:07:26] <Pinchiukas> Doesn't work.
[19:10:05] <jrockjiggz> Pinchiukas: works here: http://jsfiddle.net/yjaej/
[19:13:01] <Pinchiukas> Is the CSS property 'left' = 'marginLeft'?
[19:13:48] <letterpress> nope
[19:14:08] <Pinchiukas> How about setting 'left'? :)
[19:14:23] <jrockjiggz> jquery object methods can't use - concatenation, so instead convert to camelCase.. like   background-image would be backgroundImage
[19:14:48] <Pinchiukas> Eh?
[19:15:16] <Pinchiukas> I think I'm trying to modify a different property. :)
[19:15:26] <jrockjiggz>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
[19:16:14] <letterpress> Pinchiukas, well uh it all depends, i suppose it's not so easy to sum up. you might need to read up on css i guess…do you have anything live to look at?
[19:16:40] <Pinchiukas> Not really.
[19:17:49] <letterpress> what are you even positioning things with? i assumed css but you said margin-left in camel case. i just got here. i dunno.
[19:18:13] <Pinchiukas> I want to change the CSS property 'left'.
[19:19:26] <letterpress> yeah good luck! depending on how the element's display and position and float styles, it would change how you'd approach this.
[19:20:05] <Pinchiukas> Display is block, float I didn't set and position is relative.
[19:20:35] <Pinchiukas> How does that change things? It should change the resulting page but not the JS.
[19:21:17] <letterpress> it's all a puzzle
[19:21:25] <Pinchiukas> :|
[19:22:31] <letterpress> ok you realize that since i got here you never mentioned JS. so what exactly are you doing here?
[19:23:02] <Pinchiukas> I'm trying to move a freaking div several pixels to the right.
[19:23:10] <Pinchiukas> A relatively positioned div.
[19:23:12] <letterpress> …with what?
[19:23:22] <Pinchiukas> By modifying its property 'left'.
[19:23:29] <Pinchiukas> *CSS property
[19:23:38] <letterpress> …with? ok i'll ask. jQuery for instance?
[19:24:00] <Pinchiukas> Yes.
[19:24:17] <letterpress> ahhh ok. yeah man. now i see.
[19:24:33] <letterpress> so are you familiar with the web inspector of chrome?
[19:24:54] <taipres> I use it
[19:25:00] <taipres> is very nice, better than firefox 1
[19:25:39] <Pinchiukas> I use Firebug in Firefox.
[19:26:28] <letterpress> yeah great. so can you get the div in the right place by modifying the css in firebug?
[19:26:46] <letterpress> or is that your question?
[19:27:00] <pen> hey
[19:27:14] <pen> if I have a selector that matches nothing how do I detect that?
[19:27:23] <pen> isEmptyObject does not work
[19:27:28] <pen> even == [] doesn't work
[19:28:40] <lenswipe> hey guys
[19:29:18] <lenswipe> anyone know why "if($('.btn-danger').length() <= 0){}" gives the error of Uncaught TypeError: Property 'length' of object [object Object] is not a function
[19:29:57] <letterpress> pen, if var foo = $(".bar") matches nothing, then foo.length == 0
[19:30:17] <letterpress> or just $(".bar").length for that matter
[19:30:20] <pen> letterpress: oh
[19:30:36] <pen> letterpress: interesting
[19:30:43] <Pinchiukas> letterpress: I can do that in Firebug. Now I need to do that in JS (jQuery).
[19:31:03] <letterpress> awesome. what element(s) did you need to modify to get it to the right place?
[19:31:17] <lenswipe> if i try  console.log((".btn-danger").length()); then i get: Uncaught TypeError: Property 'length' of object .btn-danger is not a function
[19:31:21] <lenswipe> anyone know why?
[19:31:24] <systemfault> lenswipe: Well.. the message says that it's not a function...
[19:31:30] <Pinchiukas> letterpress: the div itself?
[19:31:36] <systemfault> lenswipe: Why do you call length like it's a function then?
[19:31:36] <letterpress> don't but the () after length
[19:31:42] <lenswipe> systemfault, http://api.jquery.com/length/
[19:31:48] <Pinchiukas> Imagine a page with a single div and nothing else. I want to move it with JS/jQuery.
[19:31:48] <lenswipe> nvm
[19:31:54] <lenswipe> i figured it
[19:31:56] <systemfault> ;)
[19:32:31] <lenswipe> why does console.log((".btn-danger").length); return "11" ?
[19:32:31] <letterpress> lenswipe you realize you're missing a $ or a jQuery, right?
[19:32:38] <lenswipe> oh yeah.
[19:32:40] <lenswipe> thanks
[19:37:03] <epistax> I see how to get the text of the selected option in a selection box in a change event, but how do I get the ID of the selected option?
[19:37:50] <letterpress> :selected is one way
[19:38:41] <letterpress> so $("select.class").find("option:selected"); or something like that
[19:40:19] <epistax> ahh I got you, so if it's a single selection I just gotta [0] it. I'm pretty sure this will work, thanks.Do you know any less clunky ways to get this data?
[19:40:58] <letterpress> i'm still sitting here puzzling why .length is in the jQuery api (it's native js, isn't it?), and why there's a jQuery .size() method which does the same thing.
[19:42:16] <letterpress> oh i'm reading over your questionagain epistax. you're selecting the element and just need the ID?
[19:42:36] <epistax> yep. maybe I need to ignore the combo box and just look at the options?
[19:42:41] <letterpress> $("select.class").find("option:selected").attr("id");
[19:42:56] <epistax> I'll try that right now, thanks!
[19:44:52] <Pinchiukas> What would be a nice way to get the number from a property which now is "5px" to compare to a number?
[19:49:34] <letterpress> parseFloat("5px");
[19:49:39] <letterpress> oops
[19:49:47] <letterpress> i meant parseInt("5px");
[20:11:35] <arlink> $('.result').each(function (listing){} what is listing? what heading does it fall under?
[20:21:22] <lenswipe> hey guys
[20:21:35] <lenswipe> can someone help me add additional data to a non-ajax post
[20:30:47] <raj> i'm getting a jquery.js error: object is undefined--> length = object.length
[20:31:41] <raj> how can I trace it back?
[20:33:57] <lenswipe> raj, chrome developer console and lots of console.log()s?
[20:33:58] <lenswipe> thats what i use
[20:34:12] <raj> so litter jquery.js with console.log?
[20:34:17] <lenswipe> no
[20:34:25] <lenswipe> litter your code with them
[20:34:43] <raj> i do, but this error is showing up in jquery.js
[20:37:41] <systemfault> Don't worry... jquery is fine, your code must have a small problem..
[20:48:47] <pen> hey
[20:48:52] <pen> I'm using jeditable
[20:48:55] <pen> I wonder
[20:49:07] <pen> if it's possible to remove jeditable from an element?
[20:49:15] <pen> so it will react normally again
[20:49:23] <pen> not triggering jeditable everything I click it
[20:49:44] <pen> everytime
[21:21:28] <olimoli123> Hi guys, im making a form where you enter a username and it checks my database for that username
[21:21:37] <olimoli123> if its there, it would show an error
[21:21:38] <olimoli123> username taken
[21:21:41] <olimoli123> how can i make this possible?
[21:33:14] <nights> hi
[21:33:32] <nights> how can i keep a link a link without having the href="#"  ?
[21:33:41] <nights> im using $("id").click
[21:35:00] <lenswipe> i use buttons and event handlers
[21:35:31] <systemfault> nights: What's wrong with having a href?
[21:36:16] <systemfault> nights: Just add event.preventDefault() in your click handler to avoid going at the top of the page.
[21:37:07] <lenswipe> systemfault, or return false;
[21:37:48] <systemfault> I prefer preventDefault and stopPropagation.. more explicit and gives your more control.
[21:37:58] <wookiehangover> nights: href is a required attribute for an anchor tag
[21:38:10] <wookiehangover> ...which means you can't not have it
[21:38:12] <wookiehangover> sorry
[21:41:25] <conancat> hi jquery!
[21:53:23] <blendedbychris> anyone have an example of how to use vimeo's "froogaloop" or whatever with jquery?
[21:53:43] <b1lly> froogaloop?
[21:54:50] <blendedbychris> ya
[21:54:58] <blendedbychris> it's vimeo player api i guess
[21:55:02] <blendedbychris> http://vimeo.com/api/docs/player
[21:55:20] <b1lly> https://github.com/vimeo/player-api/tree/master/javascript
[21:55:26] <blendedbychris> http://vimeo.com/api/docs/player-js
[21:55:28] <blendedbychris> ya
[21:55:38] <blendedbychris> b1lly: does it look like you have to include the js or just tag api=1
[21:55:54] <blendedbychris> i'm just having trouble with it… i've read through all of this stuff
[21:56:15] <b1lly> without looking, I would guess you'd have to include the js
[22:01:48] <nights> hi
[22:02:00] <nights> in a jquery success function
[22:02:07] <nights> how can i both evaluate code, and render to a div?
[22:03:48] <jrockjiggz> what do you mean, evaluate?
[22:04:15] <nights> hm
[22:04:18] <nights> basically
[22:04:34] <nights> when i press a button i both want to evaluate some logic, and also render to a div
[22:04:42] <nights> how can i combine those in the same request?
[22:04:46] <nights> (if possible at all)
[22:05:12] <nights> by render to div I mean something like: jQuery('#nextinfo').html(html);
[22:05:23] <nights> and by eval i mean  eval(html);
[22:06:02] <nights> perhaps two separate ajax calls is the besty
[22:06:07] <nights> but i would like to avoid it
[22:06:14] <jrockjiggz> $.ajax({url: post.php, success: function(data){ eval(data); $('div').html(data); });
[22:06:27] <nights> hmm
[22:06:33] <nights> but that will just render the code?
[22:06:45] <nights> what goes in html should actually be html
[22:06:52] <jrockjiggz> you can do anything with the data inside the success function
[22:06:58] <nights> right
[22:07:06] <nights> but i guess what i want requires two responses
[22:07:14] <nights> one for data, one for html
[22:07:16] <jrockjiggz> why?
[22:07:40] <nights> basically this is for a step-by-step wizard
[22:07:46] <nights> and when someone presses next
[22:07:55] <nights> i want to dynamically first get the next dialog
[22:07:59] <nights> (to be rendered)
[22:08:12] <nights> but also, if there was no more dialogs, i need to close or redirect the page etc
[22:08:15] <jrockjiggz> then define a variable outside your ajax function, then inside your success function, globalDataVar = data;  then you can use that data anytime you want
[22:08:44] <jrockjiggz> you can manipulate that data all you want before showing it
[22:09:04] <nights> basically i want
[22:09:16] <nights> $.ajax({url: post.php, success: function(data, html){ eval(data); $('div').html(html); });
[22:10:25] <nights> is it possible?
[22:11:03] <nights> or do i need to write code inside the success function to separate the two from the same variable?
[22:11:09] <nights> which would be a hack
[22:11:12] <jrockjiggz> are you using json?
[22:11:16] <nights> no
[22:11:19] <jrockjiggz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4122441/separate-html-returned-data-in-ajax
[22:11:56] <nights> thanks
[22:12:03] <nights> but this is nasty :(
[22:12:10] <nights> i think i will just make two requests then
[22:12:20] <nights> the logic doesnt really matter if it comes later or earlier
[22:12:38] <nights> or hm
[22:12:39] <nights> damn :(
[22:13:26] <nights>  obj.find('.content').clone();
[22:13:33] <nights> does this suggest i need to have a .content div?
[22:13:47] <nights> thats not so bad i suppose
[22:14:34] <jrockjiggz> what is this data you are getting?
[22:14:43] <nights> that could be more example
[22:15:15] <nights> "document.location.href = '".Yii::app()->createUrl( 'directory/index' )."';";
[22:15:21] <nights> (ignore the php)
[22:15:30] <nights> or another ajax request
[22:15:38] <nights> $nextCode = "$.ajax({
[22:15:38] <nights> 								type: 'POST',
[22:15:38] <nights> 								url: '".Yii::app()->createUrl( 'order/menuInit' )."',
[22:15:38] <nights> 								data: jQuery('#directory_form').serialize(),
[22:15:38] <nights> 								cache: fal
[22:15:39] <nights> oops
[22:15:42] <nights> sorry.
[22:15:49] <nights> anyway, that is what im getting.
[22:17:23] <jrockjiggz> see dataFilter
[22:17:57] <jrockjiggz> also dataType
[22:18:42] <nights> ok
[22:18:50] <nights> actually i sort of like the response separating by
[22:18:56] <nights> obj.find('.responsecode')
[22:18:57] <nights> etc
[22:19:01] <nights> is it a reasonable solution?
[22:19:49] <jrockjiggz> yea its better than increasing your http requests
[22:22:55] <nights> ok
[22:22:56] <nights> interesting
[22:23:00] <nights> i think i will work with this then
[22:23:03] <nights> it does what i want
[22:23:08] <nights> and its synchronous
[22:23:10] <jrockjiggz> yea i can't find a better solution
[22:23:17] <nights> thanks very much for the help
[22:23:21] <nights> im fine with this
[22:23:25] <jrockjiggz> np

[22:50:15] <defendguin> i'm using jquery mobile and i just need the datepicker.formatDate method  i've tried downloading just jquery ui with the core and datepicker but i'm getting undefined
[22:53:01] <bencooling> what is the exact statement thats returning undefined
[22:56:23] <defendguin> figured it out :-)
[22:57:57] <nights> in my success function i use

[23:00:25] <defendguin> $('#responsecode').text()
[23:00:34] <nights> thanks vm
[23:00:36] <nights> i just found this
[23:00:36] <nights> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/400197/extracting-ajax-return-data-in-jquery
[23:00:40] <nights> this works
[23:00:42] <nights> great
[23:01:17] <defendguin> it was xml data you were dealing with?
[23:01:26] <nights> no
[23:01:39] <nights> its just some html response im writing
[23:01:51] <defendguin> ahhh same difference
[23:02:57] <defendguin> i think this would also work  $('#responsecode', data).text()
[23:03:48] <nights> hm

[23:37:33] <LukeNukem> Hello, i have an ajax request to a file which does a check and then if true delete an sql record
[23:37:55] <LukeNukem> even if the check fails, ajax gets success and removes a div which it should only if sql record is deleted
[23:38:11] <LukeNukem> how can i avoid the div remove if check fails
[23:38:56] <defendguin> it probably returns success because it was a successful round trip to the server
[23:39:08] <LukeNukem> yes
[23:39:21] <LukeNukem> so is there any way i can let php output a number of the check fails
[23:39:25] <LukeNukem> how can i make jquery grab that output
[23:39:32] <defendguin> you need to add something to your html response to indicate the status of your query
[23:39:32] <LukeNukem> if(data == ?
[23:40:01] <LukeNukem> defendguin, i can do a check like if(data== o){ } else { }
[23:40:07] <LukeNukem> and put the remove code in there right?
[23:40:34] <defendguin> well
[23:41:12] <defendguin> in your html you need something like this <deleted>true<deleted>
[23:41:45] <LukeNukem> how can i grab that in jquery
[23:41:48] <defendguin> then you can do this if ( $('deleted').text() == 'true'){}
[23:41:58] <defendguin> just sorry
[23:42:02] <defendguin> one sec
[23:42:16] <defendguin> if ( $('deleted', data).text() == 'true'){}
[23:42:52] <defendguin> the ", data" is the context in which the selector will search
[23:44:29] <LukeNukem> ok i did this in php echo "<deleted>fail</deleted>";
[23:44:35] <LukeNukem> now to check that in php
[23:44:37] <LukeNukem> in jquery*
[23:44:44] <defendguin> right
[23:45:56] <LukeNukem> thanks a lot man :)
[23:46:10] <defendguin> happy to help
[23:47:51] <LukeNukem> defendguin, thanks to you now i can use this method to grab accurate number of rows in another script of mine :)
[23:48:09] <defendguin> :-D
[23:51:52] <defendguin> LukeNukem: selectors come in very handy
[23:52:29] <LukeNukem> also data attributes
[23:52:30] <LukeNukem> i use them a lot
[23:52:51] <defendguin> yeah html 5 is nice
[23:54:33] <LukeNukem> but some feel that its stupid we use data attributes too much
[23:54:35] <LukeNukem> read an article on it
[23:55:37] <defendguin> clearly they haven't built any awesome webapps lately
[23:55:47] <LukeNukem> yep
[23:56:01] <LukeNukem> nothing comes close to js for interactive apps <3
