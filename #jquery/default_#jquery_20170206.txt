[01:42:12] <katten11> hi
[01:45:49] <katten11> what is wrong with my function here: http://codebin.it?s=58981b82fc51f30004000001
[01:51:01] <hellyeah> is there a way to check specific node exist?
[03:11:55] <jerit_> my client wants cheese on his website... check this out https://jsfiddle.net/Lby8ojwh/
[03:12:01] <jerit_> problem is I haven't got it working
[03:12:20] <jerit_> its supposed to fade text in and out in an endless loop starting at page load
[03:15:18] <hellyeah> is it possible to check specific node exist in dom
[03:17:46] <jerit_> hellyeah: if ( $("#myDiv").length) { $("#myDiv").show(); }
[03:27:21] <hellyeah> merit how to check specific node has child?
[03:28:29] <jerit> same thing
[03:28:57] <jerit> if ($(node).child(childNode).length) { $(childNode).show(); }
[03:29:52] <jerit> for some reason, console says the commas in the array are wrong https://jsfiddle.net/c61bqbsq/
[03:38:46] <Cork> jerit: your creating an array with object wrappers
[03:38:55] <Cork> {} != []
[03:39:06] <jerit> I always forget about that
[03:39:12] <jerit> have updated but it still doesn't work https://jsfiddle.net/c61bqbsq/1/
[03:39:52] <Cork> what are you trying to do?
[03:40:13] <jerit> fade in text, wait 500ms, fade it out, fade in new text
[03:40:31] <jerit> its supposed to loop through the array and fade each string into view with a small delay
[03:40:43] <Cork> cause what the code does is: wait for 500 seconds, update the element 5 times then hide(300), show(300), hide(300)...
[03:41:04] <Cork> .html doesn't wait for .show().hide()
[03:41:21] <Cork> so you need to use .queue /.dequeue
[03:42:54] <jerit> the examples on http://api.jquery.com/jquery.queue/ confuse me
[03:43:26] <Cork> jerit: how jquery animation works is that the command you call queues the action in an array
[03:43:41] <Cork> and when the last animated function is done it calls .dequeue
[03:43:52] <Cork> and that is exactly what you need to do here
[03:44:19] <Cork> so you need to replace .html() with .queue(function() { $(this).html().dequeue(); })
[03:44:43] <Cork> (if i remember correctly, haven't used queue for years)
[03:53:07] <jerit> otherwise its never going to loop...
[05:01:46] <jerit> Cork, here's what I've got so far but its still not working right
[05:01:47] <jerit> https://jsfiddle.net/z3go9vo8/
[05:01:58] <jerit> based on examples from http://api.jquery.com/jquery.queue/
[05:02:13] <Cork> your queueing the wrong thing
[05:02:24] <jerit> sec
[05:02:32] <Cork> you need to run Div.queue(function() {}) like i showed you
[05:02:35] <Cork> not queue the element
[05:06:51] <jerit> so not this? $.queue(Div[0], "fx", IntroText());
[05:07:13] <Cork> "<Cork> so you need to replace .html() with .queue(function() { $(this).html().dequeue(); })" <--
[05:08:28] <jerit> as in -> Div.queue(Div, "fx", $(this).html(Messages[0]).hide(300));
[05:08:35] <Cork> sigh...
[05:08:36] <Cork> no
[05:08:40] <Cork> read what i said
[05:08:57] <jerit> Could you say it differently? I'm clearly not understanding
[05:09:03] <Cork> ...
[05:09:15] <Cork> take the .html() function call you have today
[05:09:23] <Cork> and replace it with .queue(function() { $(this).html().dequeue(); })
[05:10:20] <jerit> so Div.queue(function () { $(this).html().dequeue(); });
[05:10:26] <jerit> exactly like that?
[05:10:37] <Cork> except you need the content in .html()
[05:12:33] <jerit> and finally I have Div.queue(function () { $(this).html(Messages[i]).show(300).dequeue(); });
[05:12:56] <Cork> you can't use i there though
[05:13:02] <Cork> as i will update in each for loop
[05:13:06] <jerit> https://jsfiddle.net/z3go9vo8/1/
[05:13:06] <Cork> so the value will be replaced
[05:13:16] <Cork> also .show should be after the .queue() call
[05:13:30] <Cork> else you still have the same problem you are trying to fix
[05:14:02] <jerit> my stupid connection keeps dropping me :/
[05:16:49] <Cork> jerit: the queue is for the .html() not all of it
[05:17:10] <Cork> the queue is so when the animation happens not all the .html() calls happens at once
[05:18:06] <jerit> uh...so... Div.html($.queue(function() { }) ?
[05:18:14] <jerit> I'm so confused
[05:18:31] <Cork> ok, i give up
[05:19:31] <jerit> thanks thats very helpful
[08:49:38] <z1haze_work> can you not write $.ajax() calls with promises instead of callbacks?
[08:50:11] <shoky> you can.. $.ajax returns a promise
[08:50:27] <z1haze_work> weird, when i was trying the other day it wouldnt let me use .then()
[08:50:41] <shoky> (tho depends if you're asking about jquery promises, or regular promises,  and if you're talking about jq3 or earlier)
[08:51:00] <slax0r> $.when($.ajax()).then()
[08:51:02] <shoky> but you should be able to use .then() on either
[08:51:06] <shoky> no need for $.when there
[08:51:10] <shoky> $.ajax().then()
[08:51:27] <z1haze_work> but before jq3?
[08:51:45] <shoky> before jq3 it's a jquery promise,  but those still have .then()
[08:51:51] <z1haze_work> im not sure what version i was using at the time, just trying to encompass any reason why it would have happened
[08:52:02] <z1haze_work> strange
[08:52:06] <shoky> why worry about something that might've happened in the past :)
[08:55:24] <jerit`> can someone explain to me what 5 % 2 does and why it returns a value of 2?
[08:56:06] <slax0r> modulus
[08:56:10] <shoky> jerit_:  it returns a value of 1 :)
[08:56:25] * jerit` doesn't understand modulus
[08:56:28] <slax0r> https://jsfiddle.net/Lcpmg9st/
[08:56:29] <shoky> jerit_:  and it's modulus.. or you can think of it as remainder of  5 divided by 2
[08:56:39] <slax0r> as in, 5 / 2 = 2 modulus 1
[08:56:45] <slax0r> because 2 * 2 + 1 = 5
[08:57:29] <shoky> 0 % 2 = 0,   1 % 2 = 1,   2 % 2 = 0,   3 % 2 = 1,   4 % 2 = 0,  5 % 2 = 1, ... and so on, 0 then 1 then 0 then 1..
[09:26:05] <slax0r> shoky: what's 2 % 0 though :P
[09:26:28] <shoky> NaN  of course ;p
[09:40:33] <Sourcey> Hello. Can anyone explain why the class/var "second" is added here? https://jsfiddle.net/mLas8axf/
[09:41:03] <Sourcey> its never appended, but still appears when adding the others
[09:44:43] <Cork> Sourcey: side note, your table isn't closed
[09:44:56] <Cork> or rather you can't have divs inside a table
[09:45:11] <Cork> they have to go inside a td or outside the table
[09:45:49] <Sourcey> when the table is built during append it will be correct
[09:46:10] <Cork> it might still end up like that but it isn't valid dom structure
[09:46:21] <Cork> set the class on the tr and remove the div
[09:47:04] <Sourcey> ah yes
[09:47:06] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/mLas8axf/1/
[09:47:36] <Cork> and a side note table have thead, tbody and tfoot, it might give you what you want
[09:47:49] <Cork> but div isn't a solution
[10:36:32] <dglambert> yo
[11:18:56] <Toasty> Hello, using jQuery .append to create form element with the name ending in [] (name="field[]"), which works fine
[11:19:32] <Toasty> However when I use FormData to pull in the values, and send it via .ajax, the fields have empty values simply named "field"
[11:19:34] <Toasty> any ideas?
[11:19:43] <hlve> Toasty, jsfiddle time.
[11:20:11] <Toasty> The amount of boilerplate I'd have to make to demonstrate this in-place would take hours
[11:20:37] <Toasty> I mean, this normally works right? I just want to make sure that passing [] values is fine -- I swore I've done it before
[11:20:44] <Toasty> if so, clarifies that I'm doing it wrong
[11:22:12] <taplar> you are building the data object manually?
[11:27:51] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/dafey608/
[11:31:53] <Toasty> taplar -- I'm appending additional elements at the end
[11:31:57] <Toasty> w/ jquery
[11:32:07] <Toasty> going to play with this for a few
[11:34:56] <taplar> what do you mean additional elements?
[11:35:49] <taplar> serialize() will translate all named inputs in the form at the point that you execute it.  regardless of if they were statically there or dynamically generated later
[11:40:39] <Toasty> var formData = new FormData(document.querySelector('form#newItem'));
[11:41:06] <Toasty> taplar: I wasn't using serialize, but FormData, which may or may not use that internally (I'm not sure)
[11:41:30] <Toasty> Passing the var "formData" along as the data property of the .ajax call
[11:42:24] <taplar> ah, well, it'd be more of a #javascript q then, ;)
[11:42:51] <Toasty> Thanks :)
[11:45:09] <Toasty> taplar - I figured it out, and it's because I'm an idiot
[11:45:19] <Toasty> And because PHP is an idiot language
[11:45:44] <Toasty> It was passing fine, but I was universally strip_tagging and trimming everything from POST. breaking the arrays
[11:46:02] <taplar> ah
[11:46:02] <Toasty> Ugh... Been doing this so long I assumed I was beyond things like that.
[11:46:24] <taplar> iirc, you don't have to do [] for arrays for php.  you can just repeat the name
[11:46:38] <taplar> and it actually may allow for objectifying things
[11:47:03] <Toasty> Thanks for trying to assist though ;).  I think you're right ^^, I have usually just did [] to highlight that doubling the name was intentional :)
[11:47:25] <taplar> good idea, :)
[12:09:09] <taplar> we gonna rock, down to, electric avenue, and then we'll take it higher!
[12:09:23] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[12:09:26] <robertmaxrees> that song.
[12:14:03] <taplar> i've been watching a lot of videos that keep mentioning older songs, so i have the urge to go back and listen to them
[12:55:31] <ZoderUck> Hello jquery-ui 1.2  does it work with jquery 2.2 ?
[12:58:37] <shoky> jquery ui 1.2 ..?  that must be like 10 years old :)
[13:00:21] <ZoderUck> yes the auto complete i need
[13:00:37] <shoky> no.. you don't need jquery ui 1.2
[13:01:20] <shoky> i highly doubt it'd work with jq 2.2 anyways, but who knows
[13:01:43] <ZoderUck> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[13:01:56] <shoky> what about it?
[13:02:15] <ZoderUck> if i have jquery 2.2 included as an asset, do i need the seperate jquery UI ?
[13:02:22] <ZoderUck> how do you achieve auto complete ?
[13:02:34] <shoky> yes you need jquery ui for jquery ui autocomplete
[13:02:45] <ZoderUck> o
[13:02:46] <shoky> not jquery 1.2 though ;p
[13:02:50] <ZoderUck> aha ok :)
[13:02:52] <shoky> er, not jquery ui 1.2
[13:02:58] <ZoderUck> aha ok
[13:03:17] <ZoderUck> what version and where shoujld i get the correct  ui version, i cant find a 2.2 ui version on the jquery website
[13:03:26] <shoky> the latest?
[13:03:31] <shoky> jqueryui.com ?
[13:03:52] <ZoderUck> aha ok
[13:04:11] <ZoderUck> and if you look on http://jqueryui.com/  what do you see  there latest is  ui 1.12
[13:05:09] <shoky> yes?
[13:05:45] <ZoderUck> o
[13:05:59] <ZoderUck> so i am able to use ui 1.12 with jquery 2.2 ?
[13:06:20] <shoky> it says right there..  jQuery 1.7+
[13:06:25] <shoky> + means "and above"
[13:06:46] <shoky> (so, yes)
[13:06:57] <ZoderUck> aha ok
[13:06:58] <ZoderUck> i see.
[13:07:05] <ZoderUck> hmn damn thing does not work :) altough :)
[13:07:16] <shoky> then you're doing something wrong, probably..
[13:07:51] <ZoderUck> i have a  static version that works,  witouth the  yii framework
[13:08:03] <ZoderUck> and one in the YII framework, maybe you want to have a look at it ?
[13:08:15] <ZoderUck> you might see the problem quick ?
[13:08:33] <shoky> if you have a link, ok..
[13:08:39] <ZoderUck> ok
[13:08:47] <shoky> though a jsfiddle that shows the problem is best
[13:09:03] <ZoderUck> this is the static one, it works,  https://mart-uitzending-gemist.ga/pg_list/index.php    type in Bobby McFarren
[13:13:24] <Darren__> if I wanted Owl Carousel to work only on mobile, would js be the proper way to do it or css?
[13:15:17] <ZoderUck> shoky that one does work right
[13:15:40] <shoky> ya
[13:17:43] <ZoderUck> hmn yes
[13:18:03] <ZoderUck> if you have some minutes  then the domain will resolve to my xampp, so i will give you the one that is broken because proberbly
[13:18:17] <ZoderUck> proberbly i inject the javascript at the end. or in wrong order
[13:18:26] <ZoderUck> i have also mustache
[13:18:31] <shoky> checked your console?
[13:23:28] <ZoderUck> with ping to domain you mean ?
[13:25:04] <Darren__> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25817411/destroy-and-initialize-owl-carousel-based-on-viewport-size anyone know how I can achieve this without enquire.js?
[13:28:15] <shoky> ZoderUck: i meant your browser console
[13:35:53] <ZoderUck> yoyu mean the developers tool with F12 ?
[13:36:15] <shoky> ya
[13:36:30] <shoky> the console there.. where it shows you errors your page has
[13:38:14] <ZoderUck> it does not show errors
[13:38:19] <ZoderUck> wait the resolve works
[13:38:47] <ZoderUck> if you type Bobby McFarren you dont see nothing anything nada
[13:38:56] <ZoderUck> but the search does work
[13:39:29] <ZoderUck> if you type "Bobby Mc"  step2 you press arrow down key, then  search
[13:43:33] <shoky> ZoderUck: it works.. just not visible because of css..
[13:43:41] <ZoderUck> ow
[13:44:05] <ZoderUck> .ui-menu-item {    color: black }
[13:44:09] <ZoderUck> ok let me try
[13:44:46] <shoky> ZoderUck: you didn't include jquery-ui css
[13:47:23] <ZoderUck> aha okayy
[13:47:29] <ZoderUck> yes, hmn i see
[13:52:10] <ZoderUck> shoky, you look now, cdn  is used now  //code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[13:52:14] <ZoderUck> indeed it works now
[13:52:47] <ZoderUck> shoky thanks for debugging
[13:52:56] <ZoderUck> shocky you know YII and components plugin
[13:53:37] <shoky> ZoderUck nope
[14:05:36] <ZoderUck> aha ok

[17:05:26] <noob_on_rails> hi , i have this ajax call from a ruby page , where i click the favorite button(glyphicon) and it fades out. How can i render in this exact same position another glyphicon?
[17:05:31] <noob_on_rails> https://gist.github.com/frcake/eb37cc1082b46f8299e38f76478ed667
[17:30:41] <robertmaxrees> noob_on_rails why not have another element that you can simply fadeIn()
[17:31:51] <noob_on_rails> which is initially hidden ?
[17:34:58] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:38:09] <noob_on_rails> hmm , smart idea
[17:38:14] <noob_on_rails> thanks :D
[19:53:05] <sdwrage> Hey all. I have a bunch of question fields that I have TinyMCE applied to but the problem is when I try to move my containers around (The question containers) the editor (textarea) loses content and I cant type in it anymore.
[19:53:19] <sdwrage> Is there an easy way, with JQuery, to get around this issue.
[20:42:14] <lindylex> What does the selector look like for <div class="pseg"> <div class="ds-list"> </div> </div>  ds-list" inside pseg.
[20:45:29] <lindylex> Nevermind I figured it out.
[23:56:47] <itsgokul> how can i get all jquery variables
