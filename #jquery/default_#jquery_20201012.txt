[20:40:30] <DumbBat> Hey
[20:40:46] <robertmaxrees> hello
[20:40:58] <DumbBat> So I am having trouble with jquery... Like.
[20:41:15] <DumbBat> A simple date last modified script isn't working..
[20:41:28] <robertmaxrees> okay.  can you show the code?
[20:41:33] <robertmaxrees> in a jsfiddle, ideally.
[20:45:18] <DumbBat> https://jsfiddle.net/zta01b98/1/
[20:45:54] <robertmaxrees> mind defining "isn't working"?
[20:47:31] <DumbBat> It doesn't show the date last modified for the jquery version
[20:47:48] <DumbBat> I am trying to use the jquery version. But I don't see any examples on it.
[20:47:57] <robertmaxrees> you mean $('.LastModified').html(document.lastModified); ?
[20:48:15] <DumbBat> no the $(document).ready(html()
[20:48:26] <robertmaxrees> ah, so what is that supposed to do?
[20:48:29] <robertmaxrees> the html() specifically?
[20:48:51] <DumbBat> I don't know. I am jsut following instructions from school work
[20:48:54] <DumbBat> and it isn't working
[20:49:16] <robertmaxrees> can you show the instructions? because that's not valid JS.
[20:50:27] <baruna> robertmaxrees: hello. May I have a question too? I think it's jQuery related. On Mediawiki (software running Wikipedia) I figured I can get the wikicode of actual page using javascript/jQuery api. https://dpaste.com/8H8VC2LXP < this works in a way that pageContent inside the .done() variable shows the right data. But how can I extract/return the value? I mean I want to set the wikiCode variable with the
[20:50:33] <baruna> value of pageContent
[20:50:41] <robertmaxrees> baruna you can just ask the channel, not me ;)
[20:51:05] <robertmaxrees> baruna that's not jquery.
[20:51:07] <Buntspecht> DumbBat: You're trying to modify a <div> that has yet been fully defined. You probably shouldn't define the scripts inside inner elements
[20:51:20] <Buntspecht> *hasn't yet
[20:51:21] <robertmaxrees> Buntspecht they also have invalid js - one thing at a time ;)
[20:51:35] <robertmaxrees> also, the classes on the elements are defined wrong.
[20:51:40] <Buntspecht> Oh
[20:51:44] <DumbBat> code a  jquery script block  that includes the ready event  and uses the html() method to display the message " this page was last modified on: " and the last modified value within the div
[20:52:32] <DumbBat> ^ that was all I was given for instruction. With no examples of the structure of a html() method or anything in the book
[20:52:38] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:52:41] <DumbBat> sorta just dying :)
[20:52:52] <baruna> robertmaxrees: I thought it uses the deferred.done() function https://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[20:52:52] <robertmaxrees> DumbBat okay - so first off, stick all your js in a single script tag.  in jsfiddle, you can just put it in the "script" box below the html box.
[20:53:21] <robertmaxrees> next up - it says "the html method", not function.
[20:53:51] <robertmaxrees> so whenever you use document ready, it should always look like $(document).ready(function() {}); (there's a shorthand, but we'll keep this simple for now)
[20:54:21] <robertmaxrees> follow so far?
[20:54:36] <DumbBat> replacing that now
[20:55:04] <robertmaxrees> baruna that's using whatever var api = new mw.Api(); is - not jquery :)
[20:55:11] <DumbBat> It already looks like that...
[20:55:13] <robertmaxrees> DumbBat toss out the updated fiddle when you're done :)
[20:55:30] <robertmaxrees> DumbBat one is $(document).ready(html() {
[20:55:34] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:55:41] <robertmaxrees> so pick one of the two doc readies haha
[20:55:43] <robertmaxrees> delete the other one.
[20:56:18] <DumbBat> oh
[20:56:52] <robertmaxrees> what's funny is you have a mishmash of stuff there and are so close to the answer :)  so pick one of the two doc readies, delete the other one, and send out the updated fiddle.
[20:57:22] <DumbBat> https://jsfiddle.net/zta01b98/4/
[20:57:39] <robertmaxrees> where'd everything else go?
[20:58:27] <robertmaxrees> also: leave in that line that starts with $('.LastModified') :)
[20:58:30] <DumbBat> do you want me to have the html parts there?
[20:58:46] <robertmaxrees> i just want you to remove one of the two document readies.  leave everything else.
[20:59:04] <robertmaxrees> (you can edit the fiddle and click "save" and it'll update it)
[20:59:44] <DumbBat> ookay one sec
[21:01:20] <DumbBat> https://jsfiddle.net/zta01b98/5/
[21:02:19] <robertmaxrees> i mentioned leaving in the line that starts with $('.LastModified') - why'd you take it out?
[21:02:34] <DumbBat> oh i did the wrong one
[21:02:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[21:02:44] <robertmaxrees> that's not part of either document ready ;)
[21:02:50] <DumbBat> wait
[21:02:59] <DumbBat> no it is still there
[21:03:18] <DumbBat>  var xdate = document.lastModified;
[21:03:23] <robertmaxrees> lol you're making this REALLY complicated.
[21:03:42] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/14IDuUB.png just edit the javascript box to get it out of your html.
[21:04:43] <DumbBat> Robert.
[21:04:48] <robertmaxrees> ?
[21:04:49] <DumbBat> My name is dumb bat.
[21:05:00] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: you're learning to code :)
[21:05:07] <DumbBat> I have no clue what you mean by edit the javascript box
[21:05:12] <DumbBat> that could mean thousands of things
[21:05:19] <DumbBat> from moving the things to emptying it
[21:05:34] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/BOgmubp.png
[21:05:38] <robertmaxrees> the box.  labeled javascript.
[21:05:49] <robertmaxrees> stop editing the js in your html.  just edit the javascript box's code.
[21:05:57] <DumbBat> okay
[21:06:23] <DumbBat> so you want me to move each of the scripts into it?
[21:06:25] <robertmaxrees> yes
[21:06:35] <robertmaxrees> like we had them before.
[21:07:34] <DumbBat> https://jsfiddle.net/zta01b98/6/
[21:07:40] <DumbBat> there. all three are in there
[21:08:08] <robertmaxrees> you missed the document.write("This page was last modified on:", document.lastModified); :)
[21:08:22] <robertmaxrees> also remove <a href=></a> and the now empty script tags in the html.
[21:08:24] <DumbBat> that isn't jquery and works
[21:08:45] <robertmaxrees> move it into the javascript box pleaser.
[21:08:50] <robertmaxrees> *please
[21:08:56] <robertmaxrees> there's a method to the madness here.
[21:09:29] <DumbBat> https://jsfiddle.net/zta01b98/7/
[21:10:20] <robertmaxrees> okay, so back at square one.  updated this to add jquery to it: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9bLpq6uy/
[21:11:03] <robertmaxrees> now - $(document).ready(html() { doesn't make any sense - you're supposed to pass in just a function object (so it would look like .ready(html)) or define an anonymous function (.ready(function() {
[21:11:27] <robertmaxrees> so go ahead and remove that document ready block - it's not valid code :)
[21:12:15] <DumbBat> https://jsfiddle.net/zta01b98/9/ there.
[21:12:41] <robertmaxrees> awesome.  so, when it says to use the "html method", you're already doing it: $('.LastModified').html(document.lastModified);
[21:13:04] <robertmaxrees> replace the contents of the remaining document ready with that line and we'll get onto the next issue :)
[21:13:24] <robertmaxrees> (and kill that document.write while you're at it :) )
[21:14:38] <DumbBat> https://jsfiddle.net/zta01b98/11/
[21:15:23] <robertmaxrees> lol sorry, should've also deleted the one outside.  so do that.  also: <div class=".LastModified"> isn't what you want in your html.  remove the period in front of it.
[21:16:00] <DumbBat> https://jsfiddle.net/zta01b98/12/
[21:16:12] <DumbBat> okaey
[21:16:13] <robertmaxrees> :) there you go!
[21:16:23] <robertmaxrees> any questions?
[21:16:40] <DumbBat> It also is suppose to have the text
[21:16:47] <DumbBat> How would I do that part
[21:16:52] <robertmaxrees> what text?
[21:18:45] <DumbBat> uses the html() method to display the message " this page was last modified on: " and the last modified value within the div <--
[21:19:06] <robertmaxrees> okay - you were doing string concatenation before.  so do it here, too.
[21:19:47] <DumbBat> I am gonna use context clues to guess that means connection or something.
[21:21:01] <robertmaxrees> "string concatenation" means "to combine strings" - remember earlier when you had "<p>This page was last modified on: </p>" + document.lastModified ?
[21:21:20] <robertmaxrees> that's using string concatenation - you're "adding" two strings together.
[21:22:57] <DumbBat> ...
[21:23:12] <robertmaxrees> it's more effective if you ask questions instead of just sending ellipsis ;)
[21:23:52] <DumbBat> $('.LastModified').html("<p>This page was last modified on: </p>" + document.lastModified); <--??
[21:24:04] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: did you try?
[21:24:11] <DumbBat> shows nothing
[21:24:23] <robertmaxrees> works in the fiddle.  show your code if it isn't working.
[21:24:45] <DumbBat> that is the code
[21:24:54] <robertmaxrees> i mean in context on your page.
[21:25:02] <robertmaxrees> like i said, that works in the fiddle.
[21:25:21] <robertmaxrees> (feel free to leave the script tag as-is if you pop it into the fiddle)
[21:25:23] <DumbBat>     <script>           $(document).ready(function(){
[21:25:32] <robertmaxrees> please paste the page into a fiddle again.
[21:25:39] <DumbBat> okay one sec
[21:26:29] <DumbBat> https://jsfiddle.net/zta01b98/13/
[21:27:04] <robertmaxrees> heh
[21:27:23] <DumbBat> I am just crying at jquery now. cause it just refuses
[21:27:24] <robertmaxrees> so $('.LastModified') is looking for an element with the class 'LastModified'
[21:27:41] <DumbBat> yes. I put the div with that class after it.
[21:28:00] <robertmaxrees> no, you put the class '.LastModified' - why did you put the period back?
[21:28:23] <DumbBat> oh, that was  my html pag
[21:28:31] <DumbBat> OOF
[21:28:34] <robertmaxrees> heh
[21:28:51] <DumbBat>  periods . Now also the bane of a guys existance.
[21:28:58] <robertmaxrees> :|
[21:29:09] <DumbBat> anyway
[21:29:13] <DumbBat> I will go die now
[21:29:15] <robertmaxrees> a . in a jquery selector means "class", while a # means ID.
[21:29:27] <robertmaxrees> same as CSS.
[21:29:30] <DumbBat> thank you for the help
[21:29:40] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/ for some more basics.
[21:29:51] <DumbBat> I just remembered I have more work to do...
[21:30:31] <DumbBat> I am gonna do java script for the others
[21:30:38] <robertmaxrees> *javascript
[21:30:47] <robertmaxrees> jquery's gonna be easier fwiw.
[21:31:00] <DumbBat> java script was one line for  that .
[21:31:08] <robertmaxrees> **javascript
[21:31:11] <robertmaxrees> and it wasn't the same thing.
[21:31:31] <robertmaxrees> you were just appending that text using document.write (which you shouldn't use basically ever)
[21:31:59] <DumbBat> this is only for a beginners class.
[21:32:14] <DumbBat> It doesn't matter much if there are  small errors
[21:32:23] <robertmaxrees> that's not a "small error" ;)
[21:32:31] <DumbBat> It works tho
[21:32:45] <robertmaxrees> js is very forgiving.  it'll let you get away with a lot of bad practices.
[21:32:54] <robertmaxrees> "it works" is not a good reason.
[21:32:55] <robertmaxrees> also: you have this entire channel that can help you learn but hey, whatever floats y
[21:32:59] <robertmaxrees> *your boat
[21:38:16] <DumbBat> I am now done with this html course...
[21:38:25] <DumbBat> - Final project :(
[21:40:32] <robertmaxrees> why the sad face?
[21:41:29] <DumbBat> that isn't sadness. That is me dying due to having to do a final project. I am a very ... efficiency focused person
[21:42:05] <robertmaxrees> not sure i follow but alright :)
[21:43:31] <DumbBat> It's a nice way to say I don't waste my time with when I could be doing something more fun... so essentially a flavor of lazy
[21:44:04] <robertmaxrees> guessing you're not actually trying to become a software engineer then?
[21:44:22] <DumbBat> more so not working with javascript.
[21:44:30] <robertmaxrees> why javascript especially?
[21:44:50] <DumbBat> java script is harder for me than others I have started learning
[21:45:02] <DumbBat> i am half way through a python course
[21:45:09] <DumbBat> brb.
[21:45:09] <robertmaxrees> ah, that's why.
[21:45:15] <robertmaxrees> trying to treat it like other languages.
[21:45:31] <DumbBat> it was the first I tried.
[21:45:40] <robertmaxrees> heh
[22:03:53] <DumbBat> night
