[00:17:08] <d3m0n> Hey Cork, why would you suggest a span over an tag for click events
[00:17:26] <Cork> d3m0n: well i suggest not using broken links
[00:17:42] <Cork> d3m0n: <button> is the correct element to use (and you can style it)
[00:17:54] <Cork> but span is often a simpler solution
[00:18:08] <Cork> d3m0n: links should only be used when you want to offer a link
[00:18:38] <d3m0n> Ok yeah I thought you meant more semantic wise and I was thinking why span would be more semantic than an a.tag but broken part makes sense
[00:18:45] <Cork> so <a href="#"> and <a href="javascript:void()"> or <a> is basically just broken links
[00:18:53] <Cork> d3m0n: well it is
[00:18:58] <Cork> cause you arn't providing a link
[00:19:24] <d3m0n> I would figure theyre both technically wrong and button would be the right one
[00:19:37] <Cork> so you are semantically saying "here is a link; oh, btw it doesn't point anywhere"
[00:20:01] <d3m0n> a link to a pop up?
[00:20:06] <Cork> no
[00:20:10] <Cork> the link is the href
[00:20:17] <Cork> if you just want a click action it isn't a link
[00:21:12] <d3m0n> Okay, thanks for the explaination
[00:21:36] <Cork> d3m0n: if you provided a link to the server that did a full page reload and showed the pupup
[00:21:48] <Cork> and the overrided it with js to do it without the reload
[00:22:00] <Cork> your current structure would be totally valid
[00:22:51] <Cork> d3m0n: <a href="javascript: void(0);" data-text-swap="Text2"> => <a href="?popup=Text2" data-text-swap="Text2">
[00:23:11] <Cork> (if the server actually accepted that info and did the correct thing that is)
[00:24:29] <d3m0n> Makes sense
[01:18:19] <bgy> Hi
[01:27:47] <jop008> Anyone used this https://github.com/jtsage/jquery-mobile-spinbox ?
[01:27:58] <jop008> My field is too small
[01:28:34] <jop008> I can see my field partly
[01:28:44] <jop008> for long integers
[01:33:42] <ph88> will fadeIn() on an element also show child elements ?
[01:36:59] <Cork> ph88: if the children is visible, sure
[01:37:12] <Cork> ph88: fade just animates css opacity nothing else
[01:37:21] <Cork> well it plays with the display value
[01:38:34] <jop008> Anyone a good spinner for numeric inputs?
[01:39:23] <Cork> jop008: http://jqueryui.com/spinner/ ?
[01:39:46] <fossxplorer> Wondering what kind of technique is used for the scrolling effect on http://www.mediafire.com/? I thinking of opacity change when an id becomes visible?
[01:40:34] <Cork> fossxplorer: the scroll and scrollTop
[01:40:47] <Cork> then they calculate from that if the specific element is in view
[01:43:11] <fossxplorer> Cork, ok. Are you able to read off the code for it?
[01:43:34] <Cork> fossxplorer: no, i just looksed at the effects
[01:43:36] <fossxplorer> Just wondering whether they use different color or opacity adjustment
[01:43:47] <fossxplorer> Ah ok :)
[01:44:25] <Cork> opacity most likely
[01:45:05] <fossxplorer> That makes sense since there are images in the content as well. Perhaps apply and remove a class based on if the element is in the view or not.
[01:46:34] <fossxplorer> Cork, thanks for this. FYI: i just started to play with Jquery yesterday and i'm a newbie on web stuff.
[01:49:50] <jop008> <input type="text" style="width: 390px;color:green;" data-role="spinbox" data-mini="true" max="" name="objectID" id="objectID" value="" /> how to change the width of the spinbox?
[01:50:11] <jop008> green text is there but the width stays like default
[01:50:12] <Archguy> How do I display a dialog-form inside another one?
[01:51:36] <Cork> jop008: check the generated html
[01:51:44] <Archguy> Cork: ?
[01:51:50] <Cork> it is most likely a class or similar
[01:52:33] <ph88> Cork: the child had css display: none;
[01:52:44] <dannyzb> I have a JSONP connection to a remote server on my site , and I need to verify the username password .. is it safe to send them over JSONP/GET ? ( everything is TLS encrypted on both source and origin )
[01:53:00] <Cork> ph88: then you will have to make them visible too
[01:53:14] <Cork> ph88: there is no need to have display none on a child if the parent is display none
[01:53:38] <Archguy> Cork: http://stackoverflow.com/a/3993713
[02:06:57] <Cork> jop008: http://jsfiddle.net/ARuxp/128/
[02:07:15] <Cork> ah
[02:07:21] <Cork> no that will break the label

[02:08:44] <Archguy> I can't manage
[02:08:54] <Archguy> I just want to display dialog-form2 inside dialog-form3 how do I do that??
[02:10:55] <Cork> Archguy: what is "dialog-form2" and 3?
[02:12:36] <Archguy> Cork: they are jquery forms
[02:12:43] <Archguy> Cork: generated with AJAX
[02:12:57] <Cork> Archguy: you can't have forms in forms
[02:13:00] <Cork> it isn't valid html
[02:13:14] <Cork> and the browser will REALLY break if you try to do it
[02:13:21] <Cork> (i know i've tried once)
[02:14:06] <Archguy> Cork, well that just sucks..
[02:14:51] <Cork> Archguy: <form> <form></form></form> isn't valid by spec
[02:23:39] <cloudgeek> How I can close a modal in jquery ui.. I tried .hide() method but not working for me... I want close onsubmit or after submiiting a butoon.. suggest me a method

[02:23:57] <wingedsnake> so how do i make my collapsable to have a height of 100% of the page content in my IPAD?
[02:24:03] <wingedsnake> talking query mobile
[02:25:15] <wingedsnake> JQM seems to handle the width right. But not the height
[02:31:02] <jop008> I have a function can I display the linenumber of the callee?
[02:34:49] <Cork> jop008: you can trigger a stacktrace and grab it from there
[02:35:02] <Cork> jop008: though i would prob not do that
[02:35:17] <jop008> what do you suggest?
[02:35:26] <Cork> what are you trying to do?
[02:36:22] <beasty> morning all
[02:40:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> morning
[03:06:06] <ph88> Cork:  i had a weird situation where i put css display:none on a child  and when doing fadeIn() on the parent it would put  style="display: block-inline" on the child (while i didn't want this to happen)
[03:06:38] <Cork> ph88: and you are sure the selector doesn't match the child too?
[03:10:55] <sasmit87> Its gonna evening now
[03:40:05] <ph88> Cork:  yes pretty sure.  Child:  .part_top_controls > .attributesButton     Parent:  .part_top_controls
[03:40:26] <Cork> then i can't say why it happens
[03:40:33] <Cork> can you reproduce it in jsfiddle?
[04:14:08] <wilberjacsn> is there any fasttrack books for jquery
[04:14:30] <Cork> ?learn

[04:16:14] <jop008> $("#showexplanation").click(function (e) {
[04:16:27] <geiregjo> Just wondering. Is there a proper way to make a panel render between the header and footer instead of next to it.
[04:16:27] <geiregjo> <geiregjo> (I'm talking about jqm)
[04:16:31] <jop008> showexplanation2 must be treated the same
[04:17:03] <wilberjacsn> thank you cork i am new to javascript ,jquery and css i have download a css template from demo in jqueryui.com that css looks complicated have not defination what thay have constructed is that any guide or refference
[04:17:50] <Cork> jop008: i don't see any whildcards there
[04:18:08] <Cork> jop008: but if you want to have multiple elements with the same event use classes
[04:18:23] <jop008> okay
[04:18:34] <Cork> like $(".explanations").click(function (e) {
[04:18:59] <Cork> or even better $(parent).on('click', '.explanations', function (e) {
[04:19:55] <jop008> but my function is like this   $("#showexplanation").click(function (e) {     $("#showexplanation").buttonMarkup({ icon: "arrow-u" });
[04:20:08] <jop008> so unique elements must be changed
[04:20:31] <Cork> or even better $(parent).on('click', '.explanations', function (e) { $(this).buttonMarkup({ icon: "arrow-u" }); });
[04:20:34] <Cork> * $(parent).on('click', '.explanations', function (e) { $(this).buttonMarkup({ icon: "arrow-u" }); });
[04:30:29] <lianzinho> guys, what would be the easiest way to allow sharing of individual pictures which are inside a lightbox plugin?
[04:41:46] <fossxplorer> How can i easily use " href="javascript:void(0)" and then have click on button go to top of the page?
[04:43:32] <Cork> window.scrollTop = 0
[04:44:28] <fossxplorer> Where should the ^ go? In html file or a separate .js file?
[04:44:37] <Cork> in the click event
[04:45:10] <Cork> fossxplorer: href="javascript:void(0)" means nothing
[04:45:22] <Cork> except it just a way to have a link with out having a link
[04:45:28] <Cork> it was needed for ie5.5
[04:45:40] <fossxplorer> Hmm i see
[04:45:41] <Cork> (and earlier)
[04:47:22] <fossxplorer> Ok
[04:48:36] <fossxplorer> Cork, i followed http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1144805/how-do-i-scroll-to-the-top-of-the-page-with-jquery, the second answer, but i do see #top in the address bar :(
[04:49:04] <Cork> fossxplorer: uh...
[04:49:12] <Cork> just set window.scrollTop = 0
[04:49:26] <Cork> that will move the scroll to the top of the window
[04:50:14] <fossxplorer> Ok
[04:50:42] <fossxplorer> $("a[href='#header-main']").click(function() { window.scrollTop = 0;  return false;}); ?
[04:51:30] <Cork> sorry
[04:51:36] <Cork> it's scrollX for window
[04:51:45] <Cork> scrollTop is for all the other elements :/
[04:51:49] <Cork> always forget that...
[04:51:55] <Cork> but yes
[04:53:04] <fossxplorer> $('body').click(function() {window.scrollX = 0;  return false;}); works :)
[04:53:57] <fossxplorer> Hmm, now i have no biding between my a element and the js :(
[04:54:09] <fossxplorer> s/biding/binding/
[04:55:28] <fossxplorer> Cork, does it reload the page instead of just scrolling up?
[04:55:33] <Cork> no
[04:57:01] <fossxplorer> On the FF tab bar, i see the page is getting reloaded :(
[04:57:22] <Cork> then something else is doing that
[04:58:36] <fossxplorer> Now i have <a id="menuBtnHome" class="menuBtnHome" href=""> Home </a> and  $('#menuBtnHome').click(function() {window.scrollX = 0;  return false;});

[05:03:46] <seutje> avoid using "return false;" in event handlers
[05:04:03] <seutje> you probably only want to event.preventDefault() anyway
[05:04:31] <Cork> seutje: the list of problems is so long i don't really see the point
[05:06:40] <Rohan_Bhangui_> jedimind: are we meeting today?
[05:06:42] <seutje> guess I'm late to the "party"
[05:09:38] <VictorCL> I need somehelp and havent been ableto do , on jquerymobile when changing page I cannot seem how to execute a script after the new page has loaded
[05:10:13] <Cork> VictorCL: if i remember correctly there is a pageShow event
[05:10:14] <fossxplorer> Cork, thx. Can i place that code in my plugins.js that is included on the page?
[05:10:22] <fossxplorer> It works fine in the console.
[05:10:52] <Cork> fossxplorer: you should start with a little less hack and slash and actually try to understand what you are doing
[05:11:42] <fossxplorer> Sure
[05:25:11] <anli> I cannot make the accept attribute work in firefox
[05:25:21] <anli> <input type="file" accept="application/vnd.ms-excel"> for instance
[05:26:26] <fossxplorer> Cork, i figured out i need to include the snippet after the <a id='menuBtnHome'> ..
[05:27:57] <Cork> O_o'
[05:28:48] <anli> When I use accept in internet explorer, I can change the filter to image files etc, but can I have it only accept xlsx? Making it impossible for the user to change to another filter
[05:29:37] <seutje> there's a known FF issue with file input accept attribute: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=826176
[05:29:44] <seutje> not sure if it's related
[05:30:13] <anli> I cannot have accept work at all in ff
[05:32:07] <Cork> anli: accept works for me but the dialog defaults to all
[05:32:13] <anli> Oh
[05:32:17] <Cork> oh... nice, my client has gone bonkers
[05:32:20] <anli> Must check if I have something else
[05:32:24] <anli> heh
[05:32:25] <Cork> brb
[05:33:17] <Cork> there we go
[05:33:25] <Cork> yay i can see the text again :D
[05:33:30] <anli> In ff, accept does not affect the outcome for me
[05:33:30] <seutje> psh
[05:33:31] <anli> hehehe
[05:33:35] <seutje> aren't we fancy?
[05:33:47] <anli> xchat?
[05:34:11] <Cork> hexchat
[05:34:15] <anli> heh
[05:34:21] <Cork> and this is the first time i've ever had it bork on me
[05:34:21] <seutje> according to the bug report, it shouldn't be implemented in FF
[05:34:28] <anli> yeah
[05:34:33] <Cork> so i suspect the desktop
[05:34:44] <Cork> seutje: your talking about the extension filter
[05:34:46] <Cork> not mime
[05:34:51] <Cork> mime should work
[05:34:58] <seutje> oh
[05:35:08] <seutje> wondering what was off
[05:35:40] <seutje> it'll only work on a system that does mime types though
[05:35:46] <Cork> ya
[05:36:01] <seutje> but that should be like... all
[05:36:06] <Cork> though firefox has some of those mime filters built in i think
[05:45:22] <g33kyboi> jquery fancybox ($.fancybox(messagetodisplay);) suddenly stopped working. before today same code was working perfectly. Please any suggestion of possible cause as i can not figure out any. Thank you
[05:58:13] <Cork> g33kyboi: works fine here http://jsfiddle.net/DXTLe/2/
[06:06:46] <g33kyboi> Cork: thanks. the problem was my controller. I was using the writer inappropriately (I wonder why it worked before).
[06:08:14] <fossxplorer> Cork, is it hard to add animate functionality to windows.scrollTo() ?
[06:08:32] <Cork> fossxplorer: not terribly

[06:28:46] <Serdar> hello
[06:29:24] <Serdar> I was told to use AJAX to post a json string to php, is there a method in jquery which does that or do I need to look how AJAX do it?
[06:30:08] <Woet> Serdar: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[06:30:21] <Cork> Serdar: $.post(url, { json: JSON.strinfify(object_or_array) });
[06:30:38] <Cork> stringify is important else you will get params instead
[06:31:33] <Serdar> yeah to get a string I know. I will need to take a look first before I ask my next question
[06:31:39] <Serdar> thanks
[06:34:45] <fossxplorer> Cork, i'm almost there using your plugin. But i have problems binding the event to my button.
[06:36:46] <fossxplorer> Tried with $('#menuBtnHome').scrollTo(0, 500)..
[06:37:32] <Serdar> I got a question about JQuery.post at line 25-27 of the last example
[06:38:12] <Serdar> var $form = $( this ) form is a window or what exactly?
[06:38:27] <itsed_> is there a way to add an attribute to all newly created elements that match a selector?
[06:40:20] <leOm> hi
[06:40:40] <Serdar> okay forget my question
[06:49:39] <Serdar> hmm what can I do with a jqXHR object? I don't see a way to use it for document.open(jqXHR_Object);
[06:50:46] <NoiseEee> Serdar: i'd start by answering 'what are you trying to do'
[06:51:23] <Serdar> create a popup (php file) and post a json string
[06:51:27] <Serdar> to php
[06:52:04] <NoiseEee> how'd the googling go?
[06:52:33] <NoiseEee> what have you come up with so far?
[06:52:44] <Serdar> what I find is to post to a URL, but I guess this is not what will work for me
[06:53:42] <Serdar> this is what I do at the moment: var myWindow = window.open("./ticket.php", msg.TicketID, "toolbar=0,menubar=0,width=400,height=300,resizable=0");
[06:54:01] <Serdar> but there is no post etc in this method
[06:54:04] <Cork> Serdar: you can't use window.open on the response from an ajax call
[06:54:19] <Cork> you would have to do a plain form post if you want to have a separate window
[06:55:02] <Serdar> Cork, you mean as ?name=..&...?
[06:55:15] <Cork> for no that would be a get call
[06:55:39] <Cork> i mean a <form> element with a target="_new" or something like that
[06:56:17] <Serdar> hmm
[06:57:12] <Serdar> a invisible form which needs to be submitted?
[06:57:32] <Cork> if you want to do a full normal http post yes
[06:57:44] <Cork> and if you want to open a separate browser window or tab you must
[06:57:45] <NoiseEee> Serdar: or do you want to submit it via ajax/xhr and do something with the response?
[06:57:54] <Cork> else you will get blocked by the browser
[06:58:05] <Cork> NoiseEee: he wants a new browser window
[06:58:31] <Serdar> this window creates a websocket connection and will only be accepted or rejected.
[06:58:42] <Cork> uh
[06:58:52] <Cork> why are you creating a window is that is all you want to do?
[06:59:03] <Cork> just use the websocket directly or something
[07:00:33] <Serdar> If the client is logging in he opens a websocket connection. Receives anytime some information which needs to be open on a new window he can accept or reject. to do this I need to open a new websocket connection
[07:00:53] <Serdar> which will be closed after accepting/rejecting
[07:01:01] <Cork> O_o
[07:01:07] <Cork> open a new websocket connection??
[07:01:12] <Cork> why not just use the old one?
[07:01:23] <Serdar> I wanted to use modal window instead, but couldn't see any solution how to post information to this modal window
[07:01:30] <Cork> or are you talking about ajax connections?
[07:01:43] <Serdar> Cork, how should the new window know about the connection?
[07:02:12] <NoiseEee> Serdar: i think we're wondering why *you* think you need a new window at all
[07:02:18] <Cork> Serdar: i think your missing the point quite a bit on how these technologies work
[07:03:20] <Serdar> NoiseEee, the employees needs to get a popup where they see information about the ticket which should accepted (to be resolved) or rejected (because lack of skills)
[07:03:50] <Cork> Serdar: so show it in page
[07:03:51] <Serdar> maybe I am using it wrong
[07:03:55] <NoiseEee> Serdar: and you're not doing a 'modal' because
[07:04:05] <Serdar> no notification
[07:04:16] <Serdar> popups opening or blinking
[07:04:39] <Cork> Serdar: well then your down to full page loads
[07:04:56] <Cork> so just write a php page that takes an id or something as a parameter
[07:05:23] <Cork> and when the user clicks the answer trigger a reload or something on the original page
[07:05:40] <Serdar> maybe I create a image which shows what I am exactly doing and you can tell me if I go nuts or not :)
[07:05:54] <Cork> Serdar: it is quite clear what you want to do
[07:06:01] <Serdar> I am using websockets because I don't want reloads
[07:06:16] <Cork> i would argue you are planing to do some of it in the wrong place though
[07:06:20] <Serdar> or do I misunderstand?
[07:06:43] <Cork> Serdar: but then you want to use window.open that is dom0 and before any of the ajax solutions
[07:06:48] <Cork> it doesn't really work that way
[07:07:23] <Cork> Serdar: an alternative could be to use webNotifications
[07:07:36] <Cork> though it isn't fully supported cross browsers yet
[07:07:36] <Serdar> which works only with Chrome :(
[07:07:39] <Cork> no
[07:07:47] <Cork> it works in chrome and firefox
[07:07:50] <Serdar> what I saw was only chrome
[07:07:52] <Quest> for http://jsfiddle.net/e3qWG/  , if I click on the black dropdown arrow, the menu appears. but it doesnt goes away if I 1) click an option in it  or 2) move my mouse away from the menu options (once they are opened up (by black arrow click))  3)  I click some where else on the page.      How can I make the menu go away for those 3 events ?
[07:08:04] <Cork> Serdar: well webkitNotifications sure
[07:08:13] <Cork> but the standard works in firefox
[07:08:13] <Serdar> ah okay

[07:12:06] * Quest waits
[07:12:21] <barake> Quest: the UI menu has blur, focus, and select events
[07:12:57] <Quest> barake,  ya but none suits here
[07:13:46] <Quest> barake,  need an actual strategy
[07:15:12] <seutje> `g jquery outside
[07:15:13] <b-ot> seutje: Ben Alman Â» jQuery outside events: Why trigger an event on ... â†’ http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-outside-events-plugin/
[07:15:28] <seutje> Quest: ^ might be usefull for catching all the clicks outside the menu
[07:15:43] <seutje> but frankly, sounds like u want it to close on any click
[07:15:59] <barake> Quest: http://api.jquery.com/mouseleave/
[07:16:23] <Quest> hm
[07:16:29] <Quest> barake,  nice
[07:16:41] <seutje> so may be interesting to just bind a global click handler, check the target for the menu items (set them as "selected" or w/e), close the menu and perhaps stopPropagation on the items
[07:17:09] <seutje> but I doubt the latter would be necessary
[07:17:37] <shoky> there's an example of similar behaviour here  http://jqueryui.com/button/#splitbutton
[07:17:43] <barake> I'm pretty sure if you open the menu the "right" way, jQuery UI keeps tracks of that and fires the blur event when clicking outside the menu
[07:23:48] <leOm> Hey there! Can any1 tell me why I can call this function:
[07:23:48] <leOm> function menu_gap(menu) { alert(menu);}
[07:23:48] <leOm> with this:
[07:23:49] <leOm> echo "$(window).resize(menu_gap);";
[07:23:49] <leOm> but not with this:
[07:23:49] <Quest> barake,  this looks sane i guess http://jsfiddle.net/e3qWG/1/
[07:23:49] <leOm> echo "$(window).resize(menu_gap('123'));";
[07:23:49] <leOm> I'm stuck here :-/ Hope you can help!
[07:24:23] <barake> le0m: the second one calls menu_gap right away
[07:24:32] <Quest> this looks sane i guess http://jsfiddle.net/e3qWG/1/
[07:24:38] <barake> the first one is passing menu_gap to be called later
[07:25:12] <shoky> Quest: uhm don't keep calling .menu() on it
[07:26:00] <shoky> also that's bad UX.. clicking to show the menu, but mouseleave to hide it?
[07:26:17] <barake> what shoky said
[07:26:32] <Quest> shoky,  am. then?
[07:26:53] <shoky> drop the mouseleave
[07:26:54] <Quest> why isnt that a good approach
[07:27:01] <shoky> because it isn't what users expect
[07:27:19] <Quest> shoky,  well the user might not click it and moves mouse away. and wants to close the menu
[07:27:24] <shoky> and then he will frown.
[07:27:40] <shoky> then he'll click somewhere else..
[07:27:50] <shoky> or on the arrow again, i suppose..
[07:27:51] <Quest> shoky,  thats what happens, you click file menu, click an option. the menu closes
[07:28:00] <shoky> right, that's a click, not a mouseleave
[07:28:14] <Quest> same happens on mouse leave too
[07:28:18] <Quest> no?
[07:28:20] <shoky> no
[07:28:22] <Quest> hm
[07:28:23] <Quest> ok
[07:28:30] <shoky> only if you opened the menu with mouseenter
[07:28:33] <shoky> and not with a click
[07:28:41] <Quest> hm
[07:29:00] <leOm> I just want to call the function on a resize of the window and pass a dimenson to the function. but when I try to pass it, it won't start...
[07:30:48] <joroci> paste your code
[07:31:43] <shoky> leOm if you want to pass arguments to a function inside the event handler.. do that:  $(window).resize(function(e) { menu_gap(whatever,you,wat); })
[07:40:51] <leOm> joroci this is the code:
[07:40:51] <leOm> The function:
[07:40:51] <leOm> function menu_gap(value) {
[07:40:51] <leOm> alert(value);
[07:40:51] <leOm> }
[07:40:52] <leOm> To call the function:
[07:40:52] <leOm> echo '<script type="text/javascript">';
[07:40:53] <leOm> echo "$(window).resize(menu_gap('asd'));";
[07:40:53] <leOm> echo '</script>';
[07:41:17] <leOm> shoky I couldn't get it working with your code
[07:42:31] <shoky> leOm: .resize(menu_gap('asd')) is definitely wrong.. that calls menu_gap immediately
[07:42:45] <shoky> leOm: make a jsfiddle. no php please
[07:43:17] <leOm> ok brb
[07:49:55] <joroci> leOm: like this ?

[08:33:54] <Soltis> I'm creating a bodysnatch function which lets me replace element A with element B, where B should have the same event handlers A had. What's a good way to copy the handlers off A and onto B?
[08:34:17] <Soltis> (If this sort of method already exists I'd be happy to hear about it, but I didn't find anything that matched what I wanted when I looked.)
[08:36:56] <NoiseEee> Soltis: no good way at all.  if its the same elment, you could do a deep clone first and then adjust to the differences.
[08:37:14] <Soltis> NoiseEee: It's not.
[08:37:35] <Lann> Anyone happen to know how to get a function such as $('.youtubepopup').YoutubePopup to work within the context of a backbone.js view?
[08:37:35] <Soltis> NoiseEee: That's really idiotic; there's NO stable way to enumerate the handlers on a given element?
[08:38:13] <NoiseEee> Soltis: there is not. if you're the one assigning everything, you could create a lookup object or something, but otherwise you're SOL afaik
[08:40:03] <Soltis> NoiseEee: Unbelievable. And this is mostly to create predictable behaviour for other users who don't have a clue; if it were just me I wouldn't have to worry about it.
[08:40:31] <Soltis> NoiseEee: I just gotta wonder what kind of thinking omits such a basic function.
[08:40:47] <Mehrzad> Hi. what does append() return?
[08:42:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> `api append @ Mehrzad

[08:42:45] <Mehrzad> Doesn't say
[08:43:05] <Soltis> Rohan_Bhangui: Note how that utterly fails to answer the question. The API doc page also doesn't answer the question.
[08:43:23] <NoiseEee> if only there were a way to test :(
[08:43:42] <Soltis> NoiseEee: Testing to determine spec is dangerous and stupid.
[08:44:04] <Soltis> NoiseEee: (Is the return I got guaranteed? Is it going to change in future revisions? Does it mean what I think it does?)
[08:44:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> Mehrzad: I dont think it has a *RETURN* type per se
[08:44:37] <shoky> sure it does
[08:45:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> well... iguess in the sense that it returns the element
[08:45:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> + added content
[08:45:33] <shoky> it returns whatever it was called on, yea

[08:48:46] <Guest20878> shoky,  so you did dialogClass: 'forms-for-board'

[08:53:37] <minty> hey everyone!! http://pastie.org/8490130     <~~~ Im trying to accomplish this: get request from "/addressX", if that has data then get request from "/adressX+1" .... until there is no data then log the requested address...
[08:53:42] <Juslintek> On 34rd line the is google analytics code
[08:53:56] <minty> all the conditionals are good i think... but im losing scope somewhere
[08:54:13] <minty> and it just repeatedly get requests "/address0"
[08:54:53] <minty> not incrementing for me...?
[08:54:58] <mocas> this problem http://jsfiddle.net/awilliams47/xjuae/1/
[08:56:49] <shoky> minty: why are you passing that newAdd as argument to the function
[08:57:04] <minty> shoky: thought it would be the easiest way to increment
[08:57:07] <shoky> minty: that way incrementing it inside won't do anything to the outside one
[08:57:12] <shoky> cause it's passed as a copy
[08:57:15] <minty> so id get /address0 /address1 /address2
[08:57:44] <shoky> you have to increment the "global" one. not the argument..
[08:57:57] <shoky> oh sorry
[08:58:10] <shoky> didn't notice you were calling your function recursively
[08:58:31] <shoky> anyway.. you're only setting the url on the outside
[08:58:49] <shoky> why not set it inside?
[09:00:57] <minty> would that send me into callback hell if i want to reuse it?
[09:01:05] <minty> if not im not opposed to it...
[09:01:28] <shoky> i donno, you haven't shown the full code
[09:01:49] <minty> lol
[09:02:31] <shoky> but fact remains you are not changing the url.. so the url is unchanged :P
[09:03:44] <minty> i wanna change the url!
[09:03:47] <minty> thats what i want!
[09:03:48] <minty> lol
[09:04:02] <minty> JUST GO TO YOUR HOME
[09:04:06] <minty> <<billy madison voice>>
[09:04:23] <shoky> then change it
[09:04:36] <shoky> you're just passing the same url, leaving it unchanged
[09:04:38] <minty> i have to reconstruct the url everytime i increment?
[09:04:53] <stack_> hello, how do I give a style for something like a::after css selector? $('a::after').css seems to not work
[09:04:57] <minty> i wouldve thought keeping it outside, and then calling the function again wouldve done that for me
[09:05:00] <shoky> you think that the url string will automatically update itself if you increment some other var?
[09:05:21] <shoky> minty: but you're building the url OUTSIDE the function, so calling it again won't build the url again
[09:06:26] <minty> shoky: http://pastie.org/8490161
[09:06:28] <minty> ?
[09:07:04] <shoky> minty: uhm doing newAdd = 0 everytime will keep it at 0
[09:07:13] <minty> woops
[09:07:14] <minty> lol
[09:07:51] <shoky> minty:  http://pastie.org/8490179
[09:08:06] <shoky> actually just deleted one line..
[09:08:20] <shoky> and move the string concatenation inside
[09:08:22] <shoky> moved*
[09:08:51] <shoky> i suppose this is what you meant to do.. not sure if you want the "addURL" argument in the function tho
[09:09:34] <shoky> eh well that will give errors sorry
[09:09:58] <minty> it had just occured to me to concat in the get request url value :)
[09:10:11] <minty> but i still need to increment the global var right?
[09:10:12] <shoky> http://pastie.org/8490183
[09:10:41] <shoky> you don't need to increment anything global if you pass in an incremented value
[09:10:43] <minty> or it is global... nevermind
[09:11:08] <shoky> don't need that global newAdd actually.  just call the function with 0 the first time
[09:11:44] <Nancy2012> i dont know why my google map not loading into DIV .. http://jsfiddle.net/dL3CV/
[09:13:02] <minty> shoky: still just spams the same address with requests
[09:14:20] <minty> can i just do window.newAdd++  instead of newAdd++ ?
[09:15:10] <shoky> if you want.. and remove the newAdd argument. and if it really is on "window".  but that's a gross way of doing things
[09:20:09] <shoky> Nancy2012:  because jsfiddle is not loading some of those js urls properly
[09:20:24] <shoky> Nancy2012:  http://jsfiddle.net/dL3CV/2/
[09:21:07] <minty> tried throwing var self = this; on it and incrementing self.newAdd to no avail
[09:21:43] <shoky> minty: eh.. keep it simple :\  pastebin your code including the call to addCheck
[09:23:26] <minty> shoky:     http://pastie.org/8490209
[09:23:38] <minty> got rid of the self = this;
[09:23:41] <shoky> ah..
[09:24:08] <minty> omg
[09:24:09] <minty> lol
[09:24:42] <Serdar> I hate this. I know what to do, but I am sitting in front of it but can't think because of a headache :(

[09:29:24] <shoky> hiya Serdar
[09:32:23] <emaz> hi, anyone around that can answer a question regarding the jsonp implementation? :P
[09:32:38] <shoky> emaz: maybe, if you ask it
[09:33:22] <Nancy2012> shoky: thanks alot indeed :)
[09:33:54] <emaz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax/jsonp.js#L77, since the callback is overwritten at that point, wouldn't that result in multiple callbacks being called?
[09:34:23] <emaz> is it just a precaution if the same name would be generated?
[09:34:30] <emaz> callback name that is..
[09:36:45] <abes> question: on my <form> element I use onsubmit="postToHttps();", and I am trying to get some attributes in the postToHttps() function using the $(this) selector (i.e. $(this).attr('action'); but I am not getting the desired result - what might be the problem?
[09:37:22] <emaz> onsubmit="postToHttps(this)"
[09:37:24] <shoky> emaz: it's not overwritten at that point
[09:39:18] <emaz> well, ok no, you are right. But it does not call 'window[ callbackName ]' but the cached function in 'overwritten'
[09:40:26] <shoky> they are equal at that point
[09:41:00] <Cork> abes: you should add the event listner from js instead for in the html
[09:41:20] <Cork> abes: this isn't transfered into the postToHttps function when you call it like that
[09:41:54] <emaz> yeah, but what I mean is that before jqXHR.always is called, the callback installed at L58 is called. Then when jqXHR.always is called the cached callback is also called.
[09:43:28] <Bauer1> which jQuery UI should I use, that does not use isPlainObject method? my jquery is 1.3 so no isPlainObject method available
[09:44:07] <Cork> 1.3...
[09:45:04] <Bauer1> yes.. I cant easily replace it Cork, we've discussed this in the past :)
[09:45:13] <Cork> Bauer1: you would have to use an old version of jquery that was made for it
[09:45:13] <shoky> emaz: ok, that's right.. what's the problem with that?
[09:45:33] <Bauer1> but how can I find the latest jquery UI which was made for 1.3?
[09:45:37] <emaz> I just wondering about the reasoning behind that?
[09:45:46] <emaz> :)
[09:46:27] <shoky> emaz:  the one at 58 is jquery's own callback which is there to store the json response argument
[09:46:54] <shoky> emaz: and the overwritten one is if the user had his own window[ callbackName ]  function, i think
[09:47:01] <Cork> Bauer1: you would have to use jquery ui 1.8.x
[09:47:15] <shoky> so jquery calls the user's own callback too, if he had one with the same name
[09:47:18] <Cork> nothing newer supports 1.3
[09:47:19] <shoky> emaz: i think ;]
[09:47:43] <emaz> in the liklyhood that a user had named the call back '( jQuery.expando + "_" + ( nonce++ ) )'. :P
[09:48:07] <shoky> no
[09:48:17] <shoky> emaz: the user can use their own callback name in the $.ajax options
[09:49:46] <emaz> but the callbackName variable get it's value from the jsonpCallback-method in the ajaxSetup config
[09:49:58] <Bauer1> thanks Cork, I will use this for now: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.24/jquery-ui.js
[09:50:12] <shoky> emaz: unless the user specifies his own jsonpCallback override ;p
[09:50:16] <emaz> and on L57 it uses the same variable to cache any current function in window[] with the same name
[09:51:56] <emaz> hmm, ok
[09:54:32] <emaz> yeah, you are right sir. Thanks =)

[10:38:58] <jmar777> bberry6: that's just a utility function. there is no $(something).isNumeric()
[10:39:39] <bberry6> yeah, trying to work too fast, need to slow down and read >.<
[10:40:45] <jmar777> bberry6: happens :)
[10:41:02] <jmar777> crash1hd: the heightChange handler?
[10:41:22] <jmar777> crash1hd: (which isn't a real event...)?
[10:42:01] <crash1hd> ahh so thats why it works with click but not that hmm click seems to be a bit on the slow side for updatnig
[10:42:04] <crash1hd> updating*
[10:42:05] <synth_> jmar777 i don't think that's the case... if i console.log(new Date(last_entry_here)); it comes out correctly
[10:42:10] <crash1hd> anything that would be faster
[10:42:12] <synth_> unless highcharts has a built in default timezone
[10:42:29] <jmar777> synth_: `new Date()` will use local timezone, but I believe highcharts uses UTC by default
[10:42:57] <jmar777> synth_: http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts#global.useUTC
[10:43:12] <synth_> jmar777 i've tried disabling it without any luck. global: {useUTC: false}
[10:43:46] <synth_> i'll try again though
[10:44:11] <jmar777> synth_: hrmm... if that doesn't work, i don't have any great ideas
[10:44:57] <synth_> wait i don't think i was setting it correctly
[10:46:21] <synth_> jmar777 ah ha! :) it fixed my problem!
[10:46:32] <jmar777> synth_:  :)
[10:46:33] <synth_> jmar777 i was trying to set the global options on the chart level before
[10:46:41] <jmar777> synth_: awesome, glad that worked
[10:46:48] <synth_> how exciting
[11:05:16] <bberry6> so im doing a GET ajax call, and i want to have cache:false set.  All this does is attach a ?_={timestamp} to the end of the URL string
[11:05:17] <bberry6> however
[11:05:22] <bberry6> i already have an argument in the URL string
[11:05:35] <bberry6> so when my server receives it, it finds two "?"s and breaks
[11:05:59] <bberry6> is there a way around this? Should i just append my own cache busting mechanism?
[11:06:20] <jmar777> bberry6: jquery should be smart enough to detect if there's already a query string variable
[11:11:05] <Cork> bberry6: use the data argument for your params and it should work on it's own
[11:11:12] <onosendi> What's the best way to select a parent other than $(this).parent().parent()...? My form container uses: class="form-index-<loop.index here>", and I have a button in the form that needs to select another class within the form, but parent to $(this). $(this).closest('class') would work fine, but it doesn't work. It seems I have to $('.class').closest('class').
[11:11:31] <Cork> ?api closest @ onosendi
[11:11:31] <b-ot> onosendi: .closest(): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[11:11:53] <onosendi> I've read it, but I'll take another look. Thanks.
[11:12:32] <onosendi> Yea, I need to get closest of $(this), rather than having to define the selector.
[11:12:58] <Cork> what?
[11:13:10] <Cork> are you looking for a sibling or a parents sibling?
[11:13:22] <Cork> cause then closest won't work
[11:13:25] <onosendi> Parent's sibling.
[11:13:38] <onosendi> Indeed, it won't :P What's my alternative?
[11:13:42] <Cork> then you need to find the parent and then the sibling
[11:14:07] <Cork> $().closets('parent-selector').siblings('sibling-selector')
[11:14:26] <onosendi> Yea, I've been using $(this).parent().parent().parent() heh - it's ugly, and I there has to be a more efficient way, becauase if I add another container it won't work
[11:14:34] <Cork> or $().closets('parent-selector').next/prev()
[11:14:51] <Cork> onosendi: parent().parent() can be replaced with closest
[11:15:01] <Cork> but when you want a sibling you need to look for exactly that
[11:15:05] <Cork> cause it isn't a parent anymore
[11:17:59] <onosendi> Cork: I was using $(this).closest('parent-selector')...
[11:18:03] <onosendi> Cork: http://pastebin.com/Ckcs5SQw
[11:18:38] <onosendi> What would be the best way to select '.blah input' when button is clicked?
[11:19:18] <onosendi> I can't use $('.edit-form .blah input') because the form is in a loop.
[11:24:14] <Cork> onosendi: $(this).closest('.edit-form').find('.foo input')
[11:24:33] <Cork> onosendi: or $(this).closest('.edit-form').find('.blah input')
[11:24:53] <Cork> onosendi: or $(this).closest('fieldset').next().find('input')
[11:25:16] <onosendi> Ah perfect, thanks man.
[11:31:03] <Serdar> Cork, http://pastebin.com/dgaWnDA7 I use websockets this way, what do you think?
[11:32:28] <Cork> Serdar: the popup blocker will have a field day with that code
[11:32:56] <Serdar> Cork, there will be no popup blocker
[11:34:50] <Cork> well combining window.open and websocket feels a bit... dirty :)
[11:34:57] <Cork> but hey, if it works for you...
[11:37:27] <Serdar> I would love to use modal window :( but there are 3 reasons: 1. notification, 2. use of JSON strings from parent 3. more than 1 modal window should be available and no way of return to parent except of accepting/rejecting
[11:39:35] <Cork> Serdar: well you can talk to the parent from the child window
[11:39:43] <Cork> through window.parent
[11:39:50] <Cork> or sendMessage
[11:40:35] <Cork> maybe you could load one window and move it to the forground when you need to alert something
[11:40:39] <Cork> ald leav it open
[11:44:02] <Serdar> I can use my connection variable too?
[11:45:40] <Serdar> window.parent.connection.send(..) like this
[11:50:00] <Cork> Serdar: yes, you can use global variables through parent
[11:52:24] <stringoO> I'm trying to set the on click attribute using query instead of setAttribute
[11:53:03] <stringoO> When I do .prop('onclick','function()'), it doesn't seem to be getting set. any ideas?
[11:53:26] <NoiseEee> stringoO: thats not how you set handlers.
[11:53:34] <stringoO> ><
[11:53:39] <NoiseEee> stringoO: YourElement.on('click',function(){})
[11:53:45] <stringoO> i thought .prop would replace all my set attributes :(
[11:54:04] <NoiseEee> stringoO: in no world of javascript does one use attributes to set handlers.
[11:54:37] <stringoO> I'm updating the code of a file to work with ie7
[11:54:46] <stringoO> and they were doing .setAttribute( to set the on click
[11:54:55] <NoiseEee> they were 100% incorrect.
[11:55:01] <NoiseEee> use jquery.
[11:55:07] <guideX> is there something wrong with this? $(this).find(".myItem").not(":has('" + selectors + "')").each(function () {    .. and selectors contains a string like "myclass1, myclass2"
[11:55:16] <stringoO> okay. But it seems to work
[11:55:31] <NoiseEee> stringoO: its wrong, and defeats the purpose of setting handlers via JS
[11:55:39] <stringoO> okay, thanks NoiseEee
[11:56:11] <stringoO> I can use .prop for things like setAttribute('value', â€¦ etc. though, right?
[11:57:33] <vire> i have a huge handler problem http://jsfiddle.net/mH3Lj/1/ -> i have one div and span inside in initial state, when clicked the div wherever, the background changes and the span icon too, but i will implement when icon is clicked div is reset into initial state, i pass a second onClick listener into the first onClick listener, but its not working, only when listenDiv() inside clearDiv()
[11:57:38] <Cork> stringoO: no attr is the same as setAttribute
[11:57:40] <vire> is there a design pattern for this?
[11:57:44] <Cork> stringoO: prop is for properties
[11:58:10] <stringoO> Thanks Cork
[11:59:50] <Cork> stringoO: ex. this.value = 1 => $(this).prop('value', 1); this.setAttribute('value', '') => $[this).attr('value', '')
[12:03:24] <stringoO> Thanks!

[12:14:45] <stringoO> Is there an easy way to go from a dom element to the jquery wrapper for it?
[12:15:39] <stringoO> I'm trying to update a bunch of functions to use jquery, but currently they are directly manipulating the dom using getElementbyId().setAttribute

[12:22:02] <nitrospectide> How can I create a selector that looks for a string in the content of a textfield or textarea?
[12:22:26] <vire> when i uncomment //listenDiv() on line 30, it check for click, but doesnt do the job
[12:23:07] <vire> nitrospectide, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/144810/jquery-get-textarea-text
[12:24:06] <vire> nitrospectide, http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-get-value-of-textarea-using-jquery
[12:37:15] <nitrospectide> vire: So you can't actually do a selector on it, but have to retrieve the value and run a string comparison?
[12:38:29] <vire> nitrospectide, you could create a function, that loops thorugh all inputs and forms with foreach and compares their .val()
[12:38:35] <vire> via  reqgexp

[12:50:56] <nigerianceo> having some issues with clearInterval
[12:51:01] <nigerianceo> Someone wanna help?
[12:57:52] <oste> I am looking for an effect where a modal element appears as if it is growing out of a div
[12:58:15] <oste> so clicking a div will force a modal to show more details - but the modal will kind of grow from the clicked div
[12:58:33] <oste> pretty sure I have seen this before - not finding much right now tho
[12:58:45] <oste> anyone know of an example or how to do this?
[13:13:29] <banister> when i do: $.getJSON( "ajax/test.json", function( data ) { }) what is the 'this' inside the callback?

[13:31:00] <jost> nevermind: stackoverflow.com/questions/13958698/check-if-jquery-mobile-loaded
[13:32:30] <stringoO> Is there any way to get $('#btn1').click('alert("hi")'); to work without wrapping the alert in the function?
[13:35:01] <shoky> stringoO: you need to have an event handler function..
[13:35:10] <stringoO> shoky: yeah :(
[13:35:18] <shoky> what's wrong with it
[13:35:19] <shoky> ?
[13:35:30] <stringoO> I was trying to replace .attr('on click','alert('test')')
[13:35:45] <shoky> don't.
[13:35:50] <stringoO> and realized it's not a simple change to just to .click('alert')
[13:36:09] <shoky> .click(function() { alert('test'); })   what's the problem
[13:39:15] <stringoO> shoky: nothing, I just need to do the function wrapping in a lot of places, that's all :(
[13:39:37] <stringoO> I'm updating an app that has attr('on click','alert('test')') all over the place
[13:40:09] <shoky> good thing you're fixing it, then
[13:40:56] <stringoO> yup :)
[13:44:14] <jost> In a jQuery mobile app, I'm trying to manipulate a set of radiobuttons with JS. Regardless of what I do (calling .checkboxradio('refresh') in whatever order), jQuery mobile does not show the state of the radio buttons correctly - any workarounds?

[13:54:27] <crash1hd> using jQuery to grab a date from an input field console.log(Date($("#foo").val()) which grabs 11/18/2013 perfectly however I am trying to validate it against todays date and its returning false as its setting it to Date {Mon Nov 18 2013 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Mountain Standard Time)} thus its right as 00:00:00 is incorrect how do I change that to 23:59:59???
[13:55:24] <shoky> nitrospectide: use $(this).val('[required]')
[13:55:46] <shoky> nitrospectide:  in any case "this" is a DOM element, not a jquery object
[13:56:02] <shoky> you could also just use this.value
[13:56:45] <crash1hd> I tried this console.log(new Date( $("#page_date").val()+"23:59:59" ) ); but it did not work
[13:57:30] <crash1hd> nevermind realized I was missing a space :)
[13:59:42] <nitrospectide> shoky: Thanks
[14:04:51] <jost> shoky: here it is: http://jsfiddle.net/6jvWn/2/
[14:06:43] <jost> the behaviour is browser-dependent. In Opera the buttons appear unselected after them to out, in chrome and FF only if the current value is set again

[14:14:20] <Guest68827> shoky!! u r master
[14:14:34] <shoky> lol
[14:15:33] <Guest68827> shoky: is there a way I can .split()   into elements based on space... so, .split(" ") but removing any quotes in any of the elements??
[14:18:34] <shoky> Guest68827:  you can .replace('"', '')  to remove quotes, for example..
[14:22:00] <minty> damnit
[14:22:20] <minty> o, so i should .split then .replace?
[14:22:36] <shoky> if you wanna remove all quotes.. i'd replace then split ;p
[14:23:33] <Keizer> Howdy
[14:24:02] <Keizer> Hey everyone, how can I run a .each(".className") on the live DOM?
[14:24:14] <raj> how can i remove the first word from a string?
[14:24:19] <shoky> $(".className").each(...) ?
[14:24:36] <raj> I know I can turn it into an array and remove the first and then back to a string
[14:24:44] <raj> but I feel like that's asking for a bug to happen
[14:24:49] <raj> or am I overthinking it?
[14:24:51] <Keizer> shoky: I tried that but it doesn't iterate because the elements I wish to select are added AFTER the DOM is loaded
[14:24:58] <raj> although, I can't actually think of a bug
[14:25:01] <shoky> raj: jus do it
[14:25:02] <raj> i'm just paranoid
[14:25:02] <shoky> ;p
[14:25:43] <shoky> Keizer: oh.. you'd need to re-query the DOM, yeah
[14:25:48] <Keizer> Typically I need the .live()
[14:25:53] <Keizer> But .live was depreciated
[14:25:54] <shoky> has nothing to do with .live
[14:26:02] <shoky> that's for events. you haven't mentioned any events
[14:26:08] <Keizer> shoky: Correct
[14:26:10] <Keizer> I don't need event
[14:26:13] <shoky> there's good ways of doing what .live did
[14:26:19] <shoky> then you don't need .live :P
[14:26:32] <Keizer> shoky: What is the work around
[14:26:44] <Keizer> I have been using .on() for Event based
[14:26:48] <shoky> event delegation with .on
[14:27:18] <shoky> $(selector).live(event, fn)  === $(document).on(event, selector, fn)
[14:27:54] <Keizer> Ok
[14:28:03] <Keizer> Is the even delegate?
[14:28:04] <Keizer> lol
[14:28:51] <shoky> what?
[14:28:59] <Keizer> Sorry
[14:29:00] <Keizer> Forgot the T
[14:29:06] <Keizer> The Event, I don't really need
[14:29:12] <Keizer> Is the event value delegate?
[14:29:18] <shoky> no idea what you're asking
[14:29:18] <Keizer> Because I am statically invoking this
[14:31:07] <Keizer> shoky: This doesn't look right: $(document).on(event, '.procedures', .each(function(i, obj) {
[14:31:13] <shoky> huh..
[14:31:22] <shoky> it looks wrong, in fact
[14:31:31] <Keizer> Yeah I need the .each
[14:31:37] <shoky> if you say so
[14:31:40] <Keizer> lol
[14:32:01] <shoky> what's "event" btw..
[14:32:11] <Keizer> shoky: Right, I don't need event....
[14:32:13] <shoky> :\
[14:32:19] <shoky> .on is for events
[14:32:26] <Keizer> 0_0
[14:32:28] <shoky> no events, then no .on
[14:32:44] <Keizer> How do I search running DOM without .live?
[14:32:50] <shoky> wtf
[14:32:54] <shoky> .live doesn't search any DOM
[14:33:09] <Keizer> .live() worked good for me for a long time
[14:33:13] <shoky> it adds an event handler to the document element, listening for EVENTS that bubble up from other elements
[14:33:22] <shoky> then use .on
[14:33:30] <shoky> it's trivially simple to switch..
[14:33:34] <shoky> $(selector).live(event, fn)  === $(document).on(event, selector, fn)
[14:33:38] <Keizer> shoky: It is, I use .on()
[14:33:41] <Keizer> I already implemented it
[14:33:43] <shoky> "event" stands for the event name.. like "click"
[14:33:51] <Keizer> I need to run a .each() on the updated dom =\
[14:34:06] <shoky> then query the dom
[14:34:10] <Keizer> Yeah I know what an event is, I have done keycode events too
[14:34:12] <shoky> inside your event handler
[14:34:14] <Keizer> Ok
[14:34:25] <shoky> $(".className").each...
[14:34:44] <Keizer> Yeah that doesn't work after the DOM has changed a few times
[14:34:57] <Keizer> It acts like what I am trying to select doesn't exist...
[14:35:05] <shoky> then it doesn't
[14:35:06] <Keizer> Should I increase specifity like element.className?
[14:35:10] <shoky> no
[14:35:17] <shoky> if you want further help, make a jsfiddle demo
[14:35:24] <shoky> otherwise this is very pointless
[14:35:47] <Keizer> Yep
[14:36:23] <Keizer> Probably because I am putting this into a function
[14:49:56] <Keizer> shoky: This is so strange, it might be because kendo iterated the data
[14:50:24] <Keizer> So I will probably have to invoke something else to search on data iterated via Kendo template
[14:53:41] <shoky> Keizer: still very pointless
[14:54:43] <cfedde> $( this ) is a table row(<tr>...</tr>). I want to get the value of the id from this tr.  How can I do that?
[14:55:11] <shoky> cfedde: this.id
[14:55:21] <cfedde> shoky: thanks!
[14:55:39] <minty> shoky: im not able to get rid of the opening " and closing "  for my string... http://pastie.org/8491061
[14:57:07] <Serdar> can anybody tell me, why the form is invisible in this example? http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-form
[14:57:21] <Serdar> if I copy it I can see it
[14:57:31] <shoky> minty:  string = string.replace(/"/g, '');
[14:57:38] <minty> shoky: omg im an idiot
[14:57:43] <minty> didnt need to stringify
[14:57:44] <minty> lol
[14:57:54] <minty> took that out and all is well :)
[14:58:08] <minty> u r still the best tho shoky!
[14:58:10] <shoky> Serdar: what do you mean?
[14:59:20] <Serdar> shoky, the form can only be seen after clicking on the create user button
[14:59:24] <Serdar> I cannot see why
[14:59:31] <Serdar> because here it is always visible
[14:59:48] <shoky> Serdar: because of the autoOpen: false
[15:00:12] <Serdar> I also copied this one
[15:00:26] <shoky> then you did something else wrong
[15:00:30] <shoky> or different
[15:00:45] <Serdar> for me auto open sounds like the modal window should not appear
[15:00:59] <shoky> and it doesn't
[15:01:04] <Serdar> but the div is in the body
[15:01:09] <Keizer> shoky: The problem is with Kendo library. I am going to have to do a nested loop in kendo to get what I want >_<
[15:01:13] <shoky> so?
[15:01:32] <Serdar> shoky, yes here the window also not appear, but the form is visible
[15:01:43] <shoky> "here" ?
[15:01:55] <Serdar> local
[15:02:08] <shoky> like i said.. you did something else differently then.
[15:02:16] <shoky> like.. didn't include jquery-ui maybe ;)
[15:02:37] <Serdar> sure, but I am not sure which one let the div get invisible.
[15:03:18] <shoky> jquery-ui sets it to display:none
[15:03:39] <Serdar> yeah I am redownloading ui again to be sure that my version is not broken
[15:07:50] <kraytul> could anyone explain to me why new Date().setDate(ddate.getDate() + 7); returns todays date?
[15:08:16] <kraytul> (ddate is a jQuery date object that is not today and not Nov 11th)
[15:09:06] <kraytul> things online suggest that this is the way to set a date to a number of days in the future, but it's certainly not doing that.
[15:09:09] <T13|sleeps> Don't chain them and see what you get.
[15:09:33] <kraytul> T13|sleeps++ why?
[15:09:37] <kraytul> I mean, that works.
[15:09:43] <kraytul> but why, aren't things called in order?
[15:10:50] <T13|sleeps> I'm not exactly sure but I know that chaining things in the same statement that declares "new date()" doesn't work.
[15:11:01] <kraytul> interesting, well, thanks :)
[15:11:03] <kraytul> glad I asked
[15:33:03] <nafta> Hello!
[15:36:53] <nafta> if I have the following structure.. (which isn't complete) how can I point to the img inside the span?
[15:36:55] <nafta> http://jsfiddle.net/XvMy2/
[15:37:05] <nafta> I want to trigger on click on that image
[16:02:56] <chovy> NoiseEee: because script tags are bad
[16:03:38] <vinex08> http://jsfiddle.net/3zHa4/1/   hi guys, can you help me up clean my code.. in jslint says it has 77% errors.. newbie here
[16:13:32] <CodeCharm> vinex08 One easy thing to do: assign common expressions to a var. For example: var titleAnchor = $(".header-image #title a")
[16:13:46] <CodeCharm> Then use titleAnchor instead of $(".header-image #title a")
[16:15:04] <CodeCharm> But in general, I wouldn't worry too much about jslint or jshint when you are just getting started with javascript. DO KEEP TRYING to use jslint/jshint. Just don't WORRY about it too much. Learn from it, instead.
[16:18:33] <vinex08> ohh so using var is much better
[16:18:36] <vinex08> will do
[16:23:45] <CodeCharm> Yes. using var is nearly always much better.
[17:00:48] <jobney> vinex08: also, your selector is over qualified.. drop .header-image as there will be only one #title
[17:01:38] <pixelpimp> not always true, but likely
[17:02:04] <pixelpimp> There can only be one *instance* of #title; but it can move
[17:03:19] <jobney> yea.. but if you have more than one element with a specific ID, you are doing it wrong..
[17:03:26] <jobney> it should be unique to the page
[17:16:19] <scipy53> I have a problem with ajax. I have an ajax function which fires whenever someone clicks on a element I have on the page. Problem is, if someone clicks the same element many times really fast, say a double click, the code is run more than once. This isn't only a problem with ajax, just any function bound to a click of some sort.
[17:16:34] <scipy53> I want to stop the function from being called multiple times on fast clicks.
[17:16:40] <scipy53> Any way to do so?
[17:17:04] <nafta> hrmm I can't seem to select this ing correctly
[17:17:19] <jobney> scipy53: throttle the execution
[17:17:28] <scipy53> how jobney
[17:17:29] <jobney> examples in lodash/underscore
[17:18:02] <scipy53> what does that mean
[17:18:07] <jobney> http://lodash.com/docs#throttle
[17:19:04] <scipy53> cool, thanks
[17:19:16] <scipy53> No built in jquery solution though?
[17:20:39] <minty> shoky: i need your expertise!!!!
[17:20:42] <minty> lol
[17:21:36] <jobney> look at the lodash source.. throttle implementation is probably only about 10 lines of js
[17:21:47] <jobney> if you dont want to pull in another library
[17:22:01] <minty> http://pastie.org/8491325     <~~~ runnning that gives me an error of "unexpected identifier : " for the first key value pair that's returned... validated the returned json on jsonlint... not sure why im getting an error just logging it...
[17:23:48] <jobney> minty: so...
[17:23:56] <jobney> i see you are requesting it via jsonp
[17:24:02] <scipy53> thanks jobney
[17:24:03] <minty> yes
[17:24:14] <jobney> but the response is not wrapped in a function to execute
[17:24:14] <minty> i tried with json and it doesnt like the header
[17:24:23] <minty> i tried with crossDomain = true,
[17:24:49] <jobney> the server with the data has to allow the CORS
[17:24:50] <minty> didnt like the header... only when it's dataType = jsonp does the get request succeed
[17:25:10] <minty> well they obviously do, otherwise jsonp wouldnt work...
[17:25:52] <minty> i havent worked much with jsonp, but i do remember seeing that it wraps the callback in another function...
[17:25:59] <minty> so how can I reference the data?
[17:26:13] <jobney> thats not how jsonp wors
[17:26:17] <jobney> works**
[17:26:27] <jobney> jsonp requests the source like it a script tag
[17:26:43] <jobney> thus the server does not need to allow cross-domain
[17:27:02] <jobney> but it has to be wrapped like fn(data)
[17:27:28] <jobney> as far as allowing cross-domain.. i got this: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
[17:27:29] <minty> which is what jquery is doing for me when i set the dataType to jsonp right?
[17:28:25] <minty> i just want to $.getJSON!! lol
[17:31:59] <minty> jobney: i seeee
[17:32:05] <minty> so im requesting a flat page?
[17:32:07] <minty> :(
[17:32:25] <jobney> yea.. if only it was that easy
[17:34:09] <minty> hence the frowny face lol
[17:35:29] <minty> seems like a cross domain get request for a public set of data should be much easier lol
[17:35:55] <shoky> minty: their API page says on the top:  Some API calls are available with CORS headers if you add a cors=true paramter to the request
[17:36:01] <shoky> but it doesn't help for your url :(
[17:36:12] <minty> ^^ yah
[17:36:36] <minty> im sure there is another api i can use, just havent looked around yet
[17:36:54] <minty> blockchain probably has another method i can try too
[17:37:20] <minty> anyways... i need to get some GTA5 in my life before i go nuts :)
[17:38:09] <T13|sleeps> minty: ...
[17:38:13] <T13|sleeps> Too late?
[17:38:21] <minty> nope
[17:40:40] <minty> 'Some API calls are available with CORS headers if you add a cors=true paramter to the request'   <~~~ best documentation ever lol... why not just put a little * next to calls that work with CORS?!?!?!
[17:41:34] <shoky> minty welp.. you can always do it with a server-side script
[17:42:01] <minty> yay php >.>
[17:42:02] <minty> lol
[17:42:37] <minty> and ofcourse i have this on a tomcat server...
[17:42:38] <minty> lol
[17:42:52] <shoky> php on tomcat? Hm.
[17:42:58] <minty> yea, doesnt happen
[17:43:15] <minty> but its easy enough to throw httpd in front of it
[17:43:20] <shoky> i wouldn't want to see it happening ;p
[17:43:34] <shoky> i might get blinded
[17:45:13] <minty> lol
[17:58:00] <nafta> anyone around?
[17:58:18] <duch_kazatel> i am
[17:58:23] <duch_kazatel> for a few more minutes.
[17:58:59] <nafta> man this selector problem is giving me a headache
[17:59:21] <nafta> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/XvMy2/
[17:59:37] <nafta> I'm trying to trigger on click when the image inside the span gets clicked
[17:59:41] <nafta> I've tried it all
[17:59:59] <duch_kazatel> can you update that so there's an actual image?
[17:59:59] <nafta> $("body").on("click", ".portraitShareButton > img" , function() { console.log("Got clicked"); });
[18:00:58] <duch_kazatel> $('.game').on('click', 'img', function(){})};
[18:01:00] <duch_kazatel> that should work.
[18:01:14] <duch_kazatel> or $('.game').on('click', '.portraitShareButton img', function(){})};
[18:01:20] <duch_kazatel> try that second one.
[18:01:36] <nafta> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/XvMy2/3/
[18:01:40] <nafta> with an actual image
[18:02:06] <duch_kazatel> or just remove the >
[18:02:41] <duch_kazatel> you can bind using a normal selector.
[18:02:53] <duch_kazatel> $("body").on("click", ".portraitShareButton img" , function() { console.log("Got clicked"); });
[18:02:53] <duch_kazatel> done
[18:03:01] <nafta> duch_kazatel: the second one you gave me won't work
[18:03:06] <nafta> let me try the last one
[18:03:48] <duch_kazatel> $('.game').on('click', '.portraitShareButton img', function(){console.log('clicked');});
[18:03:52] <duch_kazatel> that should work
[18:04:48] <nafta> nop
[18:04:49] <nafta> nadda
[18:05:00] <duch_kazatel> i just tried it and it worked.
[18:05:16] <nafta> really?
[18:05:17] <nafta> wtf
[18:05:19] <nafta> on the fiddle?
[18:05:21] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/XvMy2/4/
[18:05:46] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/8QHjCZZ.png
[18:05:55] <nafta> I don't get it
[18:06:03] <nafta> the fiddle won't work for me either
[18:06:09] <duch_kazatel> the one I just linked?
[18:06:13] <duch_kazatel> do you have jquery selected?
[18:06:27] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/XvMy2/4/ works
[18:06:35] <duch_kazatel> what browser are you using?
[18:06:42] <nafta> firefox and chrome
[18:06:47] <duch_kazatel> yeah ff works.
[18:07:24] <duch_kazatel> so does chrome.
[18:07:30] <nafta> wtf
[18:07:52] <duch_kazatel> you went to http://jsfiddle.net/XvMy2/4/ right?
[18:10:16] <duch_kazatel> nafta?
[18:10:21] <nafta> bro
[18:10:24] <nafta> it doesn't work for me
[18:10:26] <nafta> I swear
[18:10:31] <nafta> I try to run in into the jsfiddle
[18:10:33] <nafta> and nadda
[18:10:34] <nafta> no alert
[18:10:35] <duch_kazatel> you went to the link i just sent right?
[18:10:38] <nafta> yup
[18:10:44] <duch_kazatel> you're calling console.log, not window.alert.
[18:11:04] <duch_kazatel> you ARE looking in your console, right?
[18:11:07] * nafta slaps himself
[18:11:29] <duch_kazatel> lol
[18:11:36] <duch_kazatel> figure it out?
[18:12:07] <duch_kazatel> I gotta go.  enjoy.
[18:12:08] <nafta> hrmm yes it is working
[18:12:10] <nafta> ok thanks
[18:12:16] <nafta> but it is not working on the actual code
[18:18:50] <d3m0n> How significant is diffrence in load time between loading jquery at the top versus the bottom?
[18:19:39] <d3m0n> is the*
[18:53:46] <nafta> Velveeta: you around? I've summoned you because I've tried for hours without luck
[18:56:16] <Velveeta> yep
[18:56:38] <Velveeta> but i've told you before, don't look for specific people in here to answer your questions, just ask them and let anybody that's around help out
[18:56:51] <Velveeta> there are several people with plenty of knowledge to share
[18:57:27] <nafta> alright
[18:57:32] <nafta> I'm preparing a jsfiddle
[18:57:37] <Velveeta> ok
[19:04:16] <nafta> ok Velveeta and someone that could give me a hand. Here is my fiddle.. -> http://jsfiddle.net/pgV4U/2/ the main problem I'm having is...that I am creating all the content inside <div class="game"> with an ajax call...and that makes the share button to stop working
[19:04:27] <nafta> I've been scratching my head over this
[19:04:29] <nafta> without luck
[19:04:40] <nafta> it works on the fiddle...but once I go to the code...nadda
[19:06:20] <Velveeta> so you say everything in that .game element is injected via ajax?
[19:06:34] <nafta> yes
[19:08:13] <Velveeta> so here's how you can simulate that in future fiddles: http://jsfiddle.net/pgV4U/4/
[19:08:47] <Velveeta> that being said, this fiddle demonstrates that your click handler works fine with dynamic content, so there must be some facet of your actual one that's different than what you're showing here
[19:09:47] <Velveeta> also, i see this near the end of that markup: <div class="text"/>
[19:10:09] <Velveeta> just for your knowledge going forward, that's not valid markup.. div is not a self-closing tag, you have to do this: <div class="text"></div>
[19:10:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: if nafta wanted that inline would he not use flexbox
[19:10:32] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: if he wanted what inline?
[19:10:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> the images and the text
[19:10:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> nvm
[19:10:59] <Velveeta> i don't think that's the problem he's having, i think he's saying that his click handler isn't firing
[19:11:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> just read the problem
[19:11:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhh
[19:11:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> is he using event.preventDefault() on the click
[19:11:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then calling ajax
[19:11:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> wait a sec why document.click?
[19:11:55] <Velveeta> yeah that's what i'm saying is that this example demonstrates that the selector and setup works fine, so there must be something different in what he's doing
[19:11:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: is this the new way of getting clicked elements?
[19:12:17] <Velveeta> well, document.click is the equivalent of the old .live() function
[19:12:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol Velveeta the rest of the code that he's doing
[19:12:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> i wrote quite a bit of it
[19:12:44] <Velveeta> similarly, he could have $('.game').on('click', '.thesharebutton', function () {});
[19:13:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> what is the second class argument for?
[19:13:30] <Velveeta> the element you want to target with that listener
[19:13:45] <nafta> where the hell is this <div class="text"/> coming from
[19:13:47] <Velveeta> it means whenever .game receives a click event, if e.target == .thesharebutton, fire this callback
[19:14:14] <Velveeta> nafta: the end of your original markup
[19:14:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: still confused but starting to make sense
[19:14:32] <Velveeta> `api .on @rohan_bhangui
[19:14:32] <b-ot> rohan_bhangui: No matches.
[19:14:40] <Velveeta> damnit
[19:14:48] <Velveeta> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[19:14:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: i got it
[19:14:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> thanks
[19:15:13] <Velveeta> you can either directly bind a listener to an element, or you can delegate to a higher container element, or you can delegate to the document
[19:15:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: im beginning to see the use
[19:15:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> neet stuff
[19:15:54] <Velveeta> it's for attaching listeners to a) numerous child elements without having numerous child listeners, and b) dynamic content that might not exist at the time you bind the listener
[19:15:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> *neat
[19:16:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhhh makes sense
[19:16:18] <Velveeta> so if you had say, a table of 100x100 rows and cells, and wanted a click listener for every td
[19:16:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[19:16:31] <Velveeta> you're talking 10000 listeners to bind up, which will bring a browser to its knees
[19:16:40] <Velveeta> or you can attach 1 listener to the table and tell it to match any td that's clicked
[19:16:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> makes sense
[19:16:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> thanks
[19:16:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> (btw: display: table, etc. is the new way of doing it right?)
[19:17:03] <Velveeta> and then you get 1 single listener for all of those cells, plus, any new cells that are added to the table will automatically be brought into that listener
[19:17:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> i see the use
[19:17:11] <shoky> (and this all depends on the events bubbling up from an inner element to its ancestors)
[19:17:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> for dynmaically added stuff too
[19:17:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> cool
[19:17:20] <Velveeta> tables are still perfectly valid markup, just for tabular data
[19:17:35] <Velveeta> if you have an actual data grid of some kind, table is just fine to use
[19:17:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: does display: table have issues
[19:17:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> other than compatibility maybe
[19:17:43] <Velveeta> you just shouldn't use it for layout
[19:17:49] <Velveeta> not sure
[19:17:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> i know that
[19:18:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> one of the first things you learn in programming
[19:18:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> :P how incompetent do you think i am
[19:18:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> im talking aobut display: table replacing <table>
[19:18:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> seems like display: table offers mroe customization
[19:19:05] <Velveeta> we use a custom grid system for our layout purposes
[19:19:12] <shoky> what's wrong with a <table> ?
[19:19:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> i feel like its outdated
[19:19:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> html4 stuff
[19:19:34] <Velveeta> no more so than say, p or br or div
[19:19:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> or is it valid in html5
[19:19:41] <shoky> sure
[19:19:46] <Velveeta> that's what i'm saying, it's still perfectly valid markup
[19:19:55] <Velveeta> just use it for its intended purpose, display of tabular data
[19:20:02] <shoky> the only outdated thing is using it for layouts
[19:20:13] <Velveeta> rightio
[19:20:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> shoky: i never ever use it for tables
[19:21:22] <shoky> ok?
[19:21:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> *i meant layouts
[19:21:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> my head isnt screwed on right
[19:21:59] <shoky> ah. ok, then :p
[19:23:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[19:23:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> i had to read my statement for a good minute
[19:23:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol :P
[19:24:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: so what else is cooking
[19:24:47] <shoky> donno why but that gave me a good snorty chuckle
[19:24:59] <shoky> good thing i wasn't drinking
[19:25:28] <shoky> should_sleep
[19:25:36] <Velveeta> nada, watching some football, waiting to see some various players quit screwin around and get their heads in the game
[19:25:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[19:25:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> shoky:
[19:25:46] <Velveeta> my defense is going down in flames
[19:25:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> gotta quick one for yu
[19:25:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> event.stopPropagation();
[19:25:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> and event.preventDefault();
[19:26:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> whats the difference
[19:26:14] <shoky> you try to tell me.
[19:26:38] <shoky> unless you have no idea at all, then that wouldn't be fair ;p
[19:27:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> i know both prevent actions
[19:27:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> according to documentation
[19:27:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> the first one is used a form submission context
[19:27:31] <shoky> welp they're pretty different actually
[19:27:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> the other prevents the default action?
[19:27:55] <Velveeta> they have to deal with event bubbling vs the native browser action
[19:27:59] <shoky> preventDefault()  prevents the default action that the browser might take for the event.  like a form submission actually doing the submit,
[19:28:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: when you say football you mean soccer right?
[19:28:07] <shoky> or a link click actually switching to a new page
[19:28:13] <Velveeta> no, i mean actual football :)
[19:28:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhh
[19:28:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> shoky: i get it
[19:28:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> so then what does the toher do
[19:28:39] <shoky> stopPropagation() is only about event-bubbling. it stops the event from bubbling up to the element's parents
[19:28:42] <Velveeta> the other prevents the event from bubbling its way up the dom tree
[19:28:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> bubbling?
[19:29:08] <shoky> because most events are triggered at some element (like an <a> where you clicked)
[19:29:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> so prevetnDefault is lower  im assuming?
[19:29:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes
[19:29:20] <Velveeta> and then there's also stopImmediatePropagation() which will stop the event handlers from being processed even ono the current element
[19:29:22] <shoky> and then they are automatically "bubbled up" to the eleemnt's parents
[19:29:30] <shoky> and they will fire event handlers on the parents too
[19:29:45] <Velveeta> right, so if you add a click listener to the body, and to an anchor in the body
[19:29:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh so like firing  also on tags above in the "food chain"
[19:29:59] <Velveeta> and you have an alert on both, and click the anchor, you'll get both alerts
[19:30:02] <shoky> so the event propagates from the inner element to the parents. and stopPropagation() stops this propagation
[19:30:17] <nafta> ok this is crazy Rohan_Bhangui I don't know where that /> comes from...I keep erasing code and testing
[19:30:19] <Velveeta> because it will fire on the anchor, and then bubble up to the top level of the dom and fire on the body
[19:30:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> stops the "bubbling" ?
[19:30:28] <nafta> this is nasty
[19:30:35] <shoky> propagation == bubbling  here , yeah
[19:30:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[19:30:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> nafta: whats nasty
[19:31:45] <nafta> this -> <div class="text"/>
[19:32:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> nafta: check the php
[19:32:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> if its dynamically created
[19:32:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> via ajax request
[19:33:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> nafta: i have a feeling some html code in the php is not "escaped" properly
[19:35:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> shoky Velveeta: thanks for the clarification you guys are always awesome :)
[19:35:49] <Velveeta> no problemo
[19:39:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: how come you always have the answers?
[19:40:04] <Velveeta> because this is my day job and i have lots of experience? :)
[19:41:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> relaly?
[19:41:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> really
[19:42:01] <Velveeta> yep
[19:42:09] <shoky> lol
[19:43:27] <nafta> Velveeta: it was that damned /> that was making all act weird
[19:43:39] <Velveeta> oh yeah?
[19:43:43] <nafta> yes
[19:43:52] <Velveeta> so with that fixed, it works as expected now?
[19:43:53] <nafta> never knew where it was coming from
[19:43:59] <nafta> I just deleted the whole div
[19:44:00] <nafta> haha
[19:44:05] <nafta> yes it works
[19:44:08] <nafta> thanks to both
[19:44:09] <Velveeta> cool beans
[19:45:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[19:47:07] <omgimnoob> hello friends... Im having trouble figuring out a problem... I hope you can help me. Im loading videos via the youtube api. I want to animate the the thumbnails after they are loaded. Im setting this animation by setting the transition property in my jquery and then I just set the opacity of my thumbnail. Problem is that the my animation happens before the thumbnails are loaded.

[19:48:35] <adammcarth> Hey :)
[19:49:31] <adammcarth> Does anyone program with Rails, Sinatra or likewise frameworks here? I have a question involving jQuery :/
[19:50:06] <omgimnoob> sorta hard to figure out that long script. a brief explanation. I set my vendor prefix, and then have an each statment applying the transition. And then I have my api code (oops left my key in there), and then I have a function at the end that I want to call to set opacity
[19:50:16] <Velveeta> omgimnoob: if you want to wait for the images to be loaded before you fade them in, you need to attach load events to the images themselves
[19:51:04] <Velveeta> adammcarth: a jquery question should be valid no matter what back end framework you're using, ask away
[19:51:16] <omgimnoob> velveeta: what would be an appropriate way to do this, I've heard that I should only use the load even on the body
[19:51:39] <omgimnoob> event*
[19:52:04] <Velveeta> omgimnoob: you should actually typically use document.ready to make sure your body is loaded, load also works on the body, as well as on images
[19:52:08] <adammcarth> Velveeta: My concern is it's partly theoretical, using only jQuery as the middle man. But hey take a look :) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20042001/best-way-to-automate-a-session-from-the-client-side
[19:52:20] <Velveeta> you just attach a listener to each image in the same way as you would for your body
[19:54:03] <Velveeta> adammcarth: that's what i would have advocated.. since the session is persisted on the back end (unless you're using sessionstorage or something in the client), you have to notify the back end via an ajax call or something, to tell it when to start that session
[19:54:15] <omgimnoob> Velveeta: I'll give it a shot. My only concern is that I am loading the images via appending an img tag that I've received from a JSON object. Any comment?
[19:54:50] <Velveeta> the other idea would be to start the session regardless, but use that button to set some value in the session that some event has occurred, and just check for that value for anything that needs to know whether it's happened or not
[19:55:11] <adammcarth> Velveeta: Cool. But what about someone manually going to /sessions-manager?add=user
[19:55:18] <adammcarth> Then they have forged a user session
[19:55:27] <adammcarth> and can gain access to protected areas of the application
[19:56:02] <Velveeta> omgimnoob: change this: div.append('<img src="' + thumbnailUrl + '">'); to this: $('<img src="' + thumbnailUrl + "'>').on('load', someCallback).appendTo(div);
[19:56:34] <omgimnoob> oooooo
[19:56:37] <Velveeta> adammcarth: so set a custom header in your xhr object for the ajax request and check for it in your controller
[19:57:22] <adammcarth> that sounds like fun
[19:58:12] <Velveeta> adammcarth: it's not hard, just add a headers property to your ajax object
[19:59:14] <adammcarth> $.ajax({
[19:59:28] <adammcarth> so like, headers: "blah"
[20:00:59] <Velveeta> yeah, like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7686827/how-can-i-add-a-custom-http-header-to-ajax-request-with-js-or-jquery
[20:03:18] <adammcarth> ahhhhhh
[20:03:19] <adammcarth> I love that
[20:03:51] <adammcarth> You learn something cool everyday when you write code
[20:03:53] <adammcarth> :)
[20:03:55] <Velveeta> and technically a user can still forge that if they use dev tools, but there's no way to protect against that sort of thing 100%, you can only get it good enough, which a custom header should help
[20:04:32] <adammcarth> Yeah, well this way it stops your average joe
[20:04:47] <Velveeta> rightio
[20:04:59] <adammcarth> Haha
[20:05:02] <adammcarth> thanks man, appreciate it.
[20:05:09] <Velveeta> no problemo :)
[20:08:21] <omgimnoob> Velveeta: I think you are on the right track but things are either not happening in the right order or just way way too quickly. Everything seems to be being called asynchronously
[20:08:22] <omgimnoob> http://pastebin.com/DqPSR37E
[20:09:04] <omgimnoob> My transition is being set, it seems my opacity is being set right before or exactly at the same time
[20:09:21] <omgimnoob> I can give you a live link if you dont mind me pming you
[20:09:24] <Velveeta> everything does run asynchronously, you shouldn't be using .post as your selector in that callback, it'll be handed the cope of the element that just loaded, you can just use $(this)
[20:09:46] <Velveeta> handed the scope*
[20:09:51] <Velveeta> sure you can im it to me
[20:11:03] <omgimnoob> im on a browser based irc can you PM me?
[20:52:44] <TiMike> hello
[20:52:48] <raj> hello
[20:53:27] <TiMike> i am parsing some xml
[20:53:55] <TiMike> i am attempting to match a node with 2 specific attributes
[20:54:14] <TiMike> i have this but it isnt working :/
[20:54:31] <TiMike> var logo = $(this).find('stationLogos').find('image').filter('[bg="black"],[width="50"]').text();
[20:55:05] <TiMike> is the bold text the proper way to say "find this attribute AND the second attribute?
[20:55:28] <Velveeta> remove the comma
[20:55:37] <Velveeta> the comma makes it an 'or' vs 'and'
[20:55:49] <TiMike> ohhhâ€¦ lemme try
[20:56:20] <TiMike> do i need a space in between?
[20:56:29] <Velveeta> nope, just butt em up against each other
[20:56:37] <Velveeta> otherwise it'll imply hierarchy
[20:56:45] <Velveeta> like "div span"
[20:56:49] <TiMike> ah i see
[20:57:39] <TiMike> WOO! Thanks velveeta!
[20:57:50] <TiMike> mucho appreciated
[20:57:52] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[20:57:56] <Hiroki> Hi, I'm looking for some help on my project. I have some AJAX that ~sometimes~ works .__.
[20:57:58] <Velveeta> and on that note, i'm off to bed, adios
[20:58:22] <TiMike> leave on a high noteâ€¦ what a showman you are velveeta ;)
[20:58:55] * Velveeta tips his hat and dances sideways with a cane until he's out of sight.
[20:59:09] <raj> TiMike, also want to mention your `find`s are searching without a preceding class or ID indicator (. or #)
[21:00:54] <raj> is there something I can do to make this work?--> `[$('.someClass')].indexOf($('.someClass'))`
[21:01:07] <TiMike> thx RAJ
[21:04:43] <Velveeta> raj: you can't compare the jquery-wrapped versions of those, but you can compare the actual element references, so you might be able to do this: [$('.someClass')[0]].indexOf($('.someClass')[0])
[21:05:42] <Velveeta> or you could assign the first jquery-wrapping off to a variable reference like this: var someClass = $('.someClass'); [someClass].indexOf(someClass); // that would probably work
[21:06:09] <raj> why would that second one work?
[21:06:18] <raj> oh, cuz it's the same var
[21:06:29] <raj> well, I was giving an example
[21:06:33] <Velveeta> when you try comparing 2 separately-wrapped jquery instances though, you're getting 2 separate array references to compare, so even though they're wrapping the same selector, it's the array references that are being compared, which don't match
[21:06:42] <raj> I have an array of jquery objects, and I want to find the position of $('.someClass')
[21:07:21] <Velveeta> yeah, the only way to do that would be if you had a cached reference to the original jquery-wrapped collection you're looking for in that array
[21:07:47] <raj> I don't
[21:07:56] <Velveeta> then you won't be able to compare that way
[21:07:58] <raj> that array was supposed to be the "cache"
[21:08:31] <minty> you cache the array...
[21:08:32] <Velveeta> typically when you build a caching structure, you want to cache the actual dom element references, not the jquery-wrapped versions of those elements
[21:08:35] <raj> should I have plain elements in the array instead? would that be better?
[21:08:40] <Velveeta> yepyep
[21:08:44] <raj> ok
[21:08:45] <raj> great
[21:08:46] <raj> thank you
[21:09:08] <minty> anyone familiar with bitcoin?
[21:09:09] <Velveeta> because then you can do something like this: [element1, element2, element3].indexOf(element2) or .indexOf($('.element2')[0])
[21:09:22] <raj> right
[21:09:23] <Velveeta> those element references will match properly
[21:09:24] <raj> got it
[21:09:25] <raj> thank you
[21:09:27] <Velveeta> no problem
[21:09:32] <Velveeta> and *now* i'm outta here fuh realz
[21:09:36] <Velveeta> exit, stage right
[21:09:39] <minty> be easy mac
[21:09:40] <minty> lol
[21:09:59] <raj> if I modify one of the elements, by adding an additional class to it, will it still match?
[21:10:26] <minty> match what?
[21:10:37] <minty> its selector?
[21:11:51] <raj> `var myList=[el1, el2, el3]; $(el2).addClass('test'); myList.indexOf(el2)`
[21:11:57] <raj> will it still match?
[21:13:37] <minty> raj: i think the answer is yes
[21:14:30] <minty> .addClass() adds a class to the element but doesnt change its position in the array...
[21:14:50] <raj> it's position in the array might change as well
[21:14:52] <minty> you could still find the reference to its position by:      myList.indexOf(el2);
[21:14:54] <raj> but why would that matter?
[21:15:19] <minty> then that val would change
[21:15:36] <minty> i wasnt sure what you are trying to match...
[21:15:49] <nafta> how can I select the parent div in this case? var tweetId = $(this).attr("tweetid"); ? I'm using $(.sidebar-feed-container .item-talent .theShareButton > img) problem is....the tweetid attr is on .theShareButton parent div
[21:16:25] <minty> raj: looks like you just declare an array, add a class to the 2nd object and then get its position in the array
[21:17:12] <minty> nafta: does the parent div have an id or class?
[21:17:41] <nafta> yes sidebar-item item-interactivo
[21:18:02] <nafta> problem is...I want to trigger the action when the user clicks the .theShareButton image
[21:18:04] <nafta> not the whole div
[21:18:40] <minty> then you need to stop calling the function on a div.click()
[21:19:03] <minty> and switch to $('img.theShareButton').click(function(){ //dostuff });
[21:19:30] <nafta> minty: isn't this way correct? $(.sidebar-feed-container .item-talent .theShareButton > img)
[21:19:46] <minty> ^^?
[21:19:57] <minty> you have that in the actual code?
[21:20:25] <minty> should be: $().whatever();
[21:20:27] <minty> woops
[21:20:48] <minty> $('img.theShareButton').whatever();
[21:21:20] <minty> in your case, .click();
[21:21:46] <minty> and either call a recursive function or tell it what to do on click events...
[21:21:54] <nafta> minty: problem is I need the div attr
[21:21:54] <raj> minty, what're you talking about?
[21:22:45] <minty> nafta: not sure what you are looking for now...
[21:23:13] <minty> select the parent div?   attribute a class to a div/image?     trigger a function on an img click instead of div?
[21:23:22] <raj> if I have a list of naked DOM elements, `var myList=[el1, el2, el3]`, and I then change the DOM by doing `$(el2).addClass('test')`, will `myList.indexOf(el2)` still work?
[21:23:52] <minty> raj: yes
[21:24:01] <raj> ah k, thanks
[21:24:20] <minty> but you r declaring the array... so its position wouldnt change
[21:29:08] <raj> I'm not gonna know the position
[22:15:35] <[E]sc> i'm trying to check if a form has been changed in all fields.  previously I used a .change method, but seems to target only one element.  is the .change what i should use? or is there another way to check them all before allow the user to proceed?
[22:16:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> [E]sc: could test for keyup/keydown/keypress
[22:31:27] <[E]sc> Rohan_Bhangui, thanks. i'll have a look at that.
[23:12:14] <Tapani> I have a problem. I can't modify width of a dialog. its always 607px. I tried { width: 30 } in dialog constructor and tried to change div width also with no luck
[23:12:56] <joroci> try to change it after it's loaded
[23:16:48] <Tapani> actually the width is auto
[23:17:37] <Cork> Tapani: can you reproduce it in a clean environment, ex. jsfiddle?
[23:19:46] <Tapani> lets see
[23:30:38] <Tapani> yeah the same problem http://jsfiddle.net/qn94h/1/ joroci Cork
[23:31:07] <Tapani> its something stupid
[23:33:10] <Jacta2> Tapani: String: A string representing the position within the viewport. Possible values: "center", "left", "right", "top", "bottom".
[23:33:34] <Jacta2> so what do you want to do actually? Just joined
[23:34:18] <Tapani> Jacta2:  it doesnt change the width
[23:34:19] <Bauer1> guys, I need help on a slider here: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/mtfCE line 5 in JS section is not working.. it does not display the current value
[23:35:40] <[E]sc> i'm trying to check if all fields have been inputted in a form before it is sent, is there a way to handle this? the one i'm using (a class selector that checks on change) seems to check only if one of the elements has been changed, and not all
[23:36:22] <Tapani> actually it change
[23:36:23] <Tapani> s
[23:36:41] <Cork> Tapani: minWidth
[23:36:52] <Jacta2> Tapani: but you have minwidth/width set
[23:37:09] <Cork> Tapani: http://jsfiddle.net/qn94h/2/
[23:39:23] <Bauer1> Cork: can you help with the slider issue? why cant I access the value of the slider object in line 5?
[23:40:22] <Cork> link
[23:41:17] <Bauer1> Cork: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/mtfCE
[23:41:41] <Cork> sigh
[23:41:50] <Cork> one that actually works please >_<
[23:41:56] * Cork hate codepen...
[23:43:11] <Bauer1> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/bt6fz/
[23:43:29] <Tapani> ok i figured out i had a css stylesheet loaded that messed it up also. now its fine. thanks for help
[23:43:30] <Cork> uh
[23:43:34] <Cork> slider.value?!?
[23:43:51] <Bauer1> yes Cork, I am trying to retrieve the value
[23:43:55] <Bauer1> from the slider object
[23:45:16] <Tapani> .css had a fixed dialog width in it :|
[23:46:02] <Bauer1> never mind Cork, I got it working! the var name slider confused me, it should have been slider.slider("value")
[23:46:07] <Cork> Bauer1: http://jsfiddle.net/bt6fz/1/
[23:46:32] <Cork> Bauer1: well and you should never have bothered with widget
[23:46:48] <Bauer1> why not Cork? it saves time on running the selector once more for no reason
[23:47:02] <Cork> Bauer1: $('#slider') is the element you want
[23:47:15] <Cork> check the fiddle and you'll understand what i mean
[23:47:44] <Cork> actually http://jsfiddle.net/bt6fz/4/ would be even better
[23:47:59] <Bauer1> whats the difference between $( "#slider" ).slider("widget"); and $( "#slider" );?
[23:48:24] <Cork> Bauer1: the first one gets you the widget element for the widget
[23:48:35] <Cork> instead of the element that you use for the element
[23:48:47] <Bauer1> its not the jquery item to use? whats widget then?
[23:49:07] <Cork> sometimes the widget has a wrapper element, and the widget refers to that element
[23:49:22] <Cork> ex. the ui-dialog-container
[23:49:33] <Cork> opps sorry
[23:49:40] <Cork> the original element becomes ui-dialog-container
[23:49:45] <Cork> and it gets wrapped in ui-dialog
[23:50:02] <Cork> so .dialog('widget') gets you the ui-dialog element
[23:51:25] <Bauer1> I see, so for simplicity its best to keep it simple and use like you did in 4th example? :)
[23:51:55] <Cork> Bauer1: well you might even break it in the future if you use widget
[23:52:15] <Cork> cause it isn't the element that you should work with (it happens to work now)
[23:59:40] <Bauer1> ok, will avoid it :) I used it only because the API hinted that I should use widget to retrieve the object to work with it
[23:59:54] <Cork> no
