[02:53:13] <Prabhat> Greetings!!
[02:53:20] <Prabhat> Hi all
[02:59:11] <Prabhat> I am working on a project in which i have to perform color validation i.e. There is a plate of Image of yellow color ,There should be color options that should not be of yellow color,How can i do that?please help me
[03:30:43] <acidjazz> if i have an element w/ two classes applied to it, one overwriting the other, and i want to get properties of the overriden class, is that possible in jquery?
[03:44:08] <Cork> acidjazz: you would have to remove the other class from the element, grab the value and then add the class back again
[03:44:42] <Cork> acidjazz: jquery can only access the computed style (meaning the "active style")
[03:48:09] <acidjazz> hmm what if i added an element w/ that class to the dom temporarily
[03:48:15] <acidjazz> hidden
[03:48:29] <Cork> you can set visibility:hidden
[03:48:34] <Cork> but not display: none
[03:48:53] <Cork> cause with display: none the browser doesn't build the style tree for that element so the computed style isn't correct
[03:48:57] <Cork> and yes, it has to be part of the page
[03:49:06] <acidjazz> grr
[03:49:17] <Cork> acidjazz: something you prob need to think about; why do you need this?
[03:49:20] <acidjazz> i dont want the browser to build it cuz itll do a GET on teh image
[03:49:39] <Cork> when js needs to get what style an element had it is normally cause you're doing something the wrong way
[03:49:53] <acidjazz> so you just are assuming im doing something wrong
[03:49:58] <acidjazz> off the bat
[03:50:02] <Cork> i'm not assuming
[03:50:12] <Cork> i say it is normally; i asked why
[03:50:29] <acidjazz> ok so say .cork is an element w/ a backgorund-image
[03:50:41] <acidjazz> .cork the class has a background image you have <div class="cork"><?div>
[03:50:57] <acidjazz> im writng an image preloader where the class .loading overrides background-image so that cork.jpg isnt pulled yet
[03:51:08] <acidjazz> and id liek to say hey just do <div class="cork loading"></div>
[03:51:24] <acidjazz> then ill loop through .loading, find the class that is being overriden, and load that image, then remove loading
[03:51:58] <acidjazz> boom images preloaded, and all you gotta do is add a class
[04:01:51] <acidjazz> also cork you're wrong
[04:01:56] <acidjazz> w/ display none im still getting its attributes
[04:51:50] <Duikb00t> Hmm I wanted to make a fiddle but it seems the image is not rendering with parallax js.. https://jsfiddle.net/4wojauaj/1/ someone an idea?
[04:56:06] <Cork> Duikb00t: looking at the lib it looks like it only works with vertical scroll
[04:56:23] <Duikb00t> It works horizontal as well
[04:56:38] <Duikb00t> ( here locally ) But setting up a filddle with it seems to be an issue :P
[04:57:05] <Cork> Duikb00t: the update function in the lib only checks offset().top
[04:57:08] <Cork> so i can't see how it can
[04:57:39] <Duikb00t> But I need vertical :p
[04:57:49] <Duikb00t> But the issue is that the lib doesn't work in the fiddle but it does locally
[04:57:55] <Cork> well you don't have any vertical area
[04:57:59] <Cork> only horizontal
[04:58:36] <Duikb00t> Which means the height of the DOM is too short ?
[04:58:52] <Cork> the height of the page ya, not the dom
[04:59:35] <Duikb00t> Hmm, to make it work I just set it 100% ? my body
[05:00:30] <Cork> Duikb00t: it might, donno never used the lib
[05:00:49] <Cork> the only thing i CAN say is it requires a vertical scrollbar, and you don't have one
[05:02:00] <word24> is there anyone who knows how to root an arc s mobile phone?
[05:02:20] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/4wojauaj/2/ ok let's work ont hat
[05:02:57] <Cork> word24: try ##andoid or #cyanogenmod, way WAY off topic for this channel
[05:12:48] <Duikb00t> Lol almost there: https://jsfiddle.net/4wojauaj/5/  :P now I have to see the plugin active and it's okay. Is there a way to check I can successfully call the lib?
[05:13:58] <Cork> what do you mean successfully call?
[05:14:09] <Cork> if the plugin exists on jquery?
[05:17:24] <Duikb00t> Yes
[05:17:30] <Duikb00t> Because ... it's doing .. nothing
[05:17:42] <Duikb00t> And on my computer it just works.
[05:17:46] <Cork> simplest is to just look in the browser console
[05:18:00] <Cork> if you get an error it isn't getting loaded
[05:18:13] <Cork> it was running before when the image wasn't loaded
[05:18:27] <Duikb00t> Failed to load resource: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT is all I get
[05:18:39] <Cork> you do? >_>
[05:18:42] * Cork looks again
[05:19:07] <Cork> Duikb00t: check what resource it is talking about
[05:19:13] <Cork> cause it loads just fine here
[05:19:21] <Cork> (not sure what effect you're looking for though)
[05:19:22] <Duikb00t> Ok it's now doing it
[05:19:29] <Duikb00t> after a hard refrehs
[05:19:43] <Duikb00t> But.. still
[05:20:07] <Duikb00t> No success for  the plugin, I want to test something when I Scroll but negeative
[05:20:20] <Duikb00t> ( It's not even a js issue :P ) but I can't get it working
[05:20:37] <Cork> Duikb00t: what is the effect it should give?
[05:20:50] <Cork> cause i have the two after/before blocks and the green background
[05:21:06] <Cork> (though those don't need js to work)
[05:21:34] <Duikb00t> 1) I want an image on the green area. 2) When scrolling the 'triangle' let's called it, should 'hover the image' on scroll
[05:21:50] <Duikb00t> So I think the plugin is not being called
[05:21:57] <Duikb00t> the content should overlap the image
[05:22:00] <Cork> it is
[05:22:06] <Cork> it isn't doing much, but it is called
[05:22:20] <Cork> go into the lib and put a breakpoint in the update function
[05:22:26] <Duikb00t> But where is the image? :D
[05:22:33] <Cork> i don't know the lib
[05:22:40] <Cork> debug why it isn't working
[05:30:21] <Duikb00t> eems it's reaching the breakpoint in the update function
[05:32:09] <Duikb00t> rhg
[06:41:17] <burzum> hi
[07:36:50] <compact> hi, i have http://pastebin.com/iQkZvBp2 which works fine. however how can i get it to only get the values in the current form? as i have multiple forms on the one page
[07:38:02] <Cork> compact: the paste in empty; use jsfiddle.net
[07:38:47] <compact> https://jsfiddle.net/ot201hyt/
[07:39:31] <Cork> compact: i need the html too
[07:45:22] <compact> https://jsfiddle.net/ot201hyt/2/
[07:53:50] <Cork> compact: you need to run your page through w3c validatior, the html is full of old tags and invalid nesting
[08:02:02] <compact> ok
[08:02:10] <compact> is there any other reason it won't work for forms
[08:02:53] <Cork> compact: the problem is when the html is invalid, the browser has to error correct the invalid tag wrapping
[08:03:11] <Cork> this results in element not being nested as you think
[08:03:20] <Cork> as the browser has to move things around to get a valid dom
[08:03:38] <Cork> so it is hard to predict where you are suppose to find related elements
[08:04:17] <Cork> i started trying to correct the fiddle so i could see if i could help you
[08:04:25] <Cork> but the errors are plenty and all over the place
[08:04:29] <Cork> so it needs to be fixed first
[10:07:29] <jomofcw> Hello !
[10:08:54] <jomofcw> Is there a jQuery UI Tooltip expert there :D ? I'm using it with the plugin colorbox. But, when I click a link that have a tooltip and the click open a colorbox, when the colorbox close, the tooltip appear again, and don't disapear until I click somewhere in the document... I don't understand why, and can't figure out how to fix it :>/.
[10:13:57] <jomofcw> And it seems that the "enable" method of the tootip doesn't work (I perform a disable with success but can't "enable" it again after :/).
[10:48:13] <jomofcw> The strange thing is that there is more and more people there since year, but less that speak :x. As an old friend said "Look at this channel, it's like a big stadium full of spectator, but no player on the playground..." :'(.
[10:52:17] <jerit> lol jomofcw indeed
[10:53:08] <jerit> jomofcw care to show me that code for your jquery ui tooltip?
[10:53:16] <jerit> unless you solved the issue by now that is
[10:56:51] <jomofcw> hello jerit :). Thanks for your answer ;).
[10:56:57] <jomofcw> Nop, i've not fixed it yet :/.
[10:57:18] <jomofcw> And hard to reproduce it... wait I try to JS fiddle a working one.
[11:00:22] <jerit> jomofcw my first thought was to .hide() the tooltip element if all else fails that might be an okay workaround
[11:09:40] <jomofcw> jerit yup, but I need to get it functionnal after the colorbox is closed :/...
[11:09:56] <jomofcw> jerit : https://jsfiddle.net/6onwh133/ can't reproduce the problem :/...
[11:12:12] <FancyCamel> Correct me if I'm wrong, but if you're wanting to target elements that are added to the page post-load, it's $(window).on('click','.selector',function(){}); right?
[11:13:03] <jomofcw> FancyCamel $(document) imo
[11:13:18] <jomofcw> jerit with CSS : https://jsfiddle.net/6onwh133/1/
[11:13:40] <jomofcw> but the fail thing doesn't happen :/...
[11:14:49] <jomofcw> jerit OK, it only happens when I load my through AJAX content.
[11:19:16] <jomofcw> Or not... :/
[11:40:18] <ZoderUck> Hello, i have a type=number field and when i type a value in it does not show the value. as if a  javascript deletes the value,  it works altough in cchrome
[11:41:48] <ZoderUck> can i give the url
[11:45:20] <kevr> will $(".sidebar").css("height", "0") affect all .sidebar selector elements at once?
[11:45:28] <hihohah> hello everybody
[11:45:30] <hihohah>  I have been looking around for different ways to reproduce a google earth zoom in/out effect when someone clicks an area of my image map, but didn't find anything  Could someone explain how I can create such an effect? Or what I could look into in order to achieve such a result. I am open to other ways to achieve this result
[11:46:04] <jomofcw> jerit I can't reproduce it :/ all is working well on my JSFiddle. So it's about the context. Waiting for a fix, I just destroy the reinit the tooltip on the colorbox closed callback.
[11:46:27] <jerit> you sure its working well on the jsfiddle? I got 2 tooltip and one didn't go away
[11:50:27] <hihohah> hello
[11:50:29] <hihohah>  I have been looking around for different ways to reproduce a google earth zoom in/out effect when someone clicks an area of my image map, but didn't find anything  Could someone explain how I can create such an effect? Or what I could look into in order to achieve such a result. I am open to other ways to achieve this result
[11:50:39] <hihohah> does anybody have any recommendations?
[11:51:35] <jomofcw> jerit try the version with the style : https://jsfiddle.net/6onwh133/2/
[11:53:10] <jerit> jomofcw that looks a lot better yeah
[11:53:32] <jomofcw> jerit on my online (dev server) full context, tI can see the tooltip disapear (as in the JSFiddle) but, when I close the colorbox, the tooltip appear again and won't disappear without a click in the document.
[11:54:59] <jomofcw> so, currently, I bind the "onClosed" colorbox event, and, in it, I destroy the tooltips and reinit them.
[11:55:48] <hihohah> anyone?
[11:56:03] <jomofcw> It's a trick, not really a fix.
[11:56:25] <jomofcw> hihohah google earth zoom in/out system is complex
[11:56:41] <jerit> jomofcw that sounds like a workaround
[11:56:51] <jomofcw> it zoom the image (modify its width and height) then replace it with other imageS
[11:57:05] <jomofcw> jerit yup :/ and can't fix it the clean way for the moment.
[11:57:26] <hihohah> jomofcw a simplified version is well enough. What I need actually is to zoom in on the picture, I don t care whether you see the pixels or not. And once it zoomed in display a box with some information
[11:57:33] <jomofcw> hihohah you won't find, imo, a "plugin" or something like this that will do the trick.
[11:57:35] <hihohah> hope that s +/- clear
[11:58:05] <hihohah> jomofcw an alternative?
[11:58:06] <jomofcw> hihohah so you're looking more for a picture zoom plugin, you'll find a lot on google.
[11:58:38] <jomofcw> hihohah as an example : http://www.jacklmoore.com/zoom/
[11:59:46] <hihohah> jomofcw yes I looked at it. But I want it to zoom in on the picture when someone clicks and not to give me that extra window with the closeup. If you see what I mean?
[12:00:27] <hihohah> I have an image map so far
[12:08:20] <hihohah> jomofcw I heard some people speaking about using a canvas, but it was not totally clear how that can solve my issue.
[12:14:48] <hihohah> jomofcw nevermind what I said I just downloaded the code and it does what I need. I just need to adjust the source code to zoom in more slowly.
[12:19:07] <jomofcw> hihohah fine :).
[12:19:31] <jomofcw> hihohah and yes canvas can solve your issue but it's totaly another way to do it.
[12:19:39] <jomofcw> I have to go, have a nice evening.
[12:21:23] <hihohah> thx bye
[13:03:02] <z1haze_work> anyone familiar of an issue where sometimes if you load a new image via ajax, the css doesnt always take effect?
[13:04:48] <z1haze_work> can notice it here: http://bit.ly/2c5QeaZ if you click the swatches to change colors, they load in all squished.. if you inspect element and check/uncheck any css at all, it fixes itself
[13:09:42] <Angell> Hey... this is kinda offtopic but it does relate because most everything is powered by jquery. I'm looking for a good bootstrap datagrid. I've used bs_grid (and I like it) but I'm looking for something else, perhaps something better maintained
[13:51:07] <solidpizza> hello, I am having an issue, on document load I try to focus a field. $('#field').focus(); but it only works whenever the page is refreshed with the keyboard hitting f5. if you click the link to this page or click the refresh button the the field is not getting focused
[13:53:57] <solidpizza> actually it only works *sometimes* when hitting f5 or ctrl-R.
[13:57:53] <solidpizza> well, I just have to set timeout to 1 and it works :/ kinda odd though.
[13:58:33] <taplar> is it a dynamic field?
[13:59:36] <solidpizza> taplar: it's there in the html, not added in with js if that's what you mean
[14:00:06] <taplar> ok, so it should be available to select.  you said your doing a document load?
[14:00:17] <solidpizza> yeah
[14:00:24] <taplar> how so?
[14:00:41] <solidpizza> $(document).ready(function() { ... });
[14:01:00] <taplar> alright, seems fine then
[14:05:33] <Yepp> I did a $.each on inputs. Inside the each I do $(element), I'm trying to get the one that is checked. How do I select that?
[14:06:03] <taplar> checkboxes i assume?
[14:06:14] <Yepp> radio
[14:06:40] <taplar> $('radioselector').filter(':checked')
[14:07:04] <Yepp> thanks. i'll keep that in mind next time
[14:08:03] <taplar> otherwise inside an each you should be able to conditional on element.checked rather than wrapping it at all
[14:09:29] <Yepp> taplar: when selecting with attributes, do we need to put quotes around? like [value=male] or [value="male"] ?
[14:09:36] <Yepp> or either will do?
[14:09:52] <taplar> you should put quotes.  more times than not it will save your ass
[14:10:08] <taplar> but that aside, you really should not select on attributes
[14:10:10] <Yepp> but it'll work right? anyway i'll still put one
[14:10:28] <taplar> it'll work, ya
[14:10:29] <Yepp> i have radio button and I need to filter out the male from female
[14:10:42] <Yepp> so I need to check with attribute on this one
[14:10:49] <Yepp> specifically the value obviously
[14:11:13] <taplar> i would select the radio by a class and then filter on the value, personally
[14:28:24] * taplar wishes he had some cinnamon tea
[14:51:16] <Yepp> how do we set radio value using semantic ui's set value method? http://semantic-ui.com/behaviors/form.html#writing-values
[14:51:25] <Yepp> there's one for checkbox
[15:28:55] <JonelethIrenicus> anyone know how I can pass a few variables to my dialog?
[15:56:07] <dglambert> Hey I have a query that picks up submit button clicks and use this line of code on the last line to resume the submit $(this).closest('form').submit();
[15:56:19] <dglambert> is there another way of doing this, or do I even need it
[15:57:24] <taplar> are you cancelling the submit inside the handler?
[15:57:40] <taplar> hold on, are catching submit or click?
[15:58:39] <dglambert> click
[15:58:52] <taplar> iirc you shouldn't have to worry about it then
[15:58:57] <dglambert>     $('button[type=submit]').click(function () {
[15:58:57] <dglambert>         $("body").css("cursor", "wait");
[15:58:57] <dglambert>         $("button").css("cursor", "wait");
[15:58:57] <dglambert>         $("textarea").css("cursor", "wait");
[15:58:57] <dglambert>         //$(this).closest('form').submit();
[15:58:58] <dglambert>     });
[15:59:00] <dglambert> ugh sorry
[15:59:25] <taplar> $('body, button, textarea').css('cursor', 'wait');
[15:59:40] <dglambert> oh thanks!
[16:00:17] <taplar> also use on('click' insead of click()
[16:00:24] <taplar> click() is a wrapper for on()
[16:00:34] <dglambert> oh ok
[16:01:00] <dglambert> If it were on('submit', ... how would I resume executin
[16:01:18] <dglambert> Do I need to explicitly submit the form, or could I return?
[16:01:44] <taplar> you shouldn't have to return or submit the form iirc.  the click event should happen before it bubbles up to be turned into a submit for the form
[16:01:53] <dglambert> ok
[16:01:59] <taplar> verify that though, ;)
[16:02:01] <dglambert> just curious
[16:02:03] <dglambert> got it
[16:42:05] <MechaJMLP> Hi ! When I use fadeOut() with a duration of 0, the callback never gets called, any idea why ?
[16:42:12] <unsigned_long> hey
[16:42:13] <unsigned_long> code golf: I have a $(...) with 3 items and want to remove 2 at random. What would be a smart solution?
[16:45:46] <z1haze_work> why would you use fadeout with a duration of 0..
[16:48:06] <MechaJMLP> because I have an object that either fades out for real (with a duration of 600) then calls the callback... or disappears immediately and calls the callback
[16:48:17] <MechaJMLP> so I put that in a function that takes the duration as a parameter
[16:48:33] <z1haze_work> you can use hide()
[16:48:55] <MechaJMLP> yeah but that would require an if() in my function, whereas now it's only one line long
[16:49:28] <z1haze_work> change the 0 to a 1, i doublt you'll notice a ms difference
[16:49:34] <MechaJMLP> yes 1 works
[16:49:40] <MechaJMLP> → my question
[16:49:49] <MechaJMLP> out of curiosity, what's wrong with 0
[16:52:36] <z1haze_work> it looks like with a duration of 0, it actually runs hide()
[16:53:52] <z1haze_work> which makes sense, no reason to do more work than necessary
[16:54:14] <MechaJMLP> but hide() also supports calling a callback, so it should call it just the same
[16:55:44] <z1haze_work> MechaJMLP: https://jsfiddle.net/7ud22fw6/
[16:57:45] <z1haze_work> seems to get called for me
[16:57:50] <MechaJMLP> yup
[16:57:56] <MechaJMLP> dunno what didn't work in my code
[16:58:05] <z1haze_work> make a fiddle
[16:58:28] <MechaJMLP> nah I'm too lazy. It works with 1, I'm ok with this
[16:58:33] <MechaJMLP> thanks anyway
[16:58:35] <z1haze_work> lol np
[17:11:27] <jqnb> What is the "right" way to break out of a promise error chain? Let's say I have an error handler callback that can handle certain errors. If it can't handle the error I'd like to propagate it so that another .fail callback can handle it.
[17:14:40] <jqnb> My scenario is, I have a wrapper function around $.ajax that's called from several places in my code. If the ajax call fails due to a 401 I want to redirect the user to the signin page. If it's a different error, I want each caller of the wrapper to deal with the error using a .fail. However if the error was a 401 I want to stop propagating the error to prevent the other .fail() down the chain from trying to handle the error.
[17:19:43] <chriscalip> hello. can someone point me to a right direction.. would like to trigger functionA if and only if both ajax calls functionB and functionC are done..
[17:22:09] <taplar> chriscalip: take a look at $.when()
[17:23:09] <chriscalip> taplar thanks
[17:24:58] <shoky> jqnb: it depends if you're using jquery 3 or an earlier jquery. before 3 errors were not really propagated in any useful manner. from jq 3, if you use .then and .catch  then it's just like any standard promise (promises/a+ compatible)
[17:25:24] <shoky> jqnb: with 3  you can simply throw a new Error from your .then or your .catch
[17:27:52] <jqnb> shoky: I'm on earlier than 3. I'd like to propagate the error, but only on certain conditions (ie it was not a 401 error).
[17:28:27] <shoky> jqnb: you'd have to wrap the whole thing with your own $.Deferred()  and resolve/reject it yourself.. not too fun :|
[17:28:32] <jqnb> shoky: I was thinking of returning a new rejected promise
[17:28:48] <shoky> returning it from where?
[17:29:41] <shoky> oh
[17:30:29] <jqnb> From the wrapper. So I say I have foo() that internally calls ApiWrapper() which itself calls $.ajax. I was thinking ApiWrapper() would have a .fail() callback that would check for a 401 if it's not then it would return a new rejected promise to foo().
[17:31:42] <jqnb> But foo()'s fail() would still be called even though ApiWrapper()'s .fail() did handle the error. I don't know how to distinguish between the two from foo()'s .fail()
[17:32:45] <jqnb> I was thinking of having ApiWrapper() reject with a null error object, and then foo() could check if the error object is null. If it is, I assume it's been handled, if not then I need to handle it. I don't know if that's hacky though...
[17:34:10] <jqnb> I would be assuming that a null error object means error handled, but I don't know if that's guaranteed. I figured there's some patterns around this, but haven't been able to find anything in blogs or stackoverflow :/
[17:34:53] <shoky> i forgot that you can just returned a rejected promise in a .then()
[17:36:31] <shoky> so if you use .then() instead of .fail()  you can do that.  i'm not sure how you were gonna do it otherwise, and without creating your own deferred
[17:38:17] <OnTheRocks> hello
[17:38:18] <OnTheRocks> https://jsbin.com/vimepisine/edit?html,output
[17:38:27] <OnTheRocks> do you know why draggable is not working?
[17:38:31] <shoky> btw that pattern you describe with the null error object is very common in node.js (js running on the server), they even call them node-backs (as opposed to regular call-backs)
[17:38:43] <shoky> but it's not needed when using promises
[17:39:24] <OnTheRocks> shoky: that answer was for me?
[17:39:32] <shoky> nope
[17:39:47] <OnTheRocks> ah ok
[17:40:22] <shoky> OnTheRocks you're including jquery-ui before jquery
[17:40:37] <OnTheRocks> must be after?
[17:40:56] <shoky> yes, jquery-ui depends on jquery, i.e. jquery must already be included before it
[17:41:34] <OnTheRocks> https://jsbin.com/vimepisine/edit?html,output
[17:41:40] <OnTheRocks> that way is correct?
[17:42:36] <shoky> //  is not a comment in html  :)
[17:43:35] <OnTheRocks> cool
[17:43:43] <OnTheRocks> its working now
[17:43:52] <OnTheRocks> i know i fixed it
[17:44:01] <OnTheRocks> must be <!-- -->
[17:44:04] <OnTheRocks> right?
[17:44:20] <shoky> that's html comments ya.
[17:45:18] <OnTheRocks> ok thanks!
[17:55:39] <jqnb> shoky: cool thanks. I'll look into using .then()
[18:56:45] <Forbidd3n> Hi everyone. Using $(document).ajaxStart(function() { ... } is there any way to get the url of the ajax call?
[18:57:38] <Forbidd3n> nvm found it
[18:58:15] <sshaun> If i've bound multiple ajaxError handlers to document, can I somehow stop propagation in one of the handlers? I've tried event.stopPropagation(), event.stopImmediatePropagation(), return false.
[18:59:00] <sshaun> reason being, I've got a widget that needs to intercept status 403 errors and prevent the other ajaxError handlers from executing
[20:50:14] <Forbidd3n> How would I select an option based on data attribute data-title
[20:51:55] <Forbidd3n> var val = $("#selectid['data-title={title}']).val(); and then set the value $('#selectid').val( val);
[21:15:23] <bango> Forbidd3n have you resolved your question?
[21:15:33] <Forbidd3n> bango: yes, thanks
[21:15:38] <bango> cool
[21:15:39] <Forbidd3n> I figured it out
[22:08:44] <GeekMonkey> Is there a way that if a element is display:none to remove from DOM
