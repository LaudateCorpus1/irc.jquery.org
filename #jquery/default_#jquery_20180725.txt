[02:30:56] <du> anyone have a preferred means for detecting when a section is "in view" while scrolling?
[02:31:05] <du> thinking relation to pushstate url changes
[02:31:09] <du> in relation to
[06:07:54] <randominternetus> there's beforeChange and afterChagne events in jquery. but onChange doesn't seem to do anything (same as change)
[06:08:02] <randominternetus> where did I go wrong?
[06:08:45] <Woet> randominternetus: "onChange" is not a jQuery event.
[06:09:16] <Woet> also, I never heard of beforeChange / afterChange
[06:09:21] <randominternetus> Woet, yeah I figured. :D the question is, what's the appropriate event for that?
[06:09:23] <Woet> not sure what you're referring to
[06:09:33] <Woet> appropriate event for what?
[06:10:14] <randominternetus> this works. but I want it to log right on change. not before or after it. $('#slider').on('beforeChange', function(){console.log('d');});
[06:10:38] <Woet> randominternetus: "beforeChange" is not a jQuery event.
[06:10:42] <randominternetus> Woet, I need to change the background color of a div when a slider slides.
[06:10:52] <Woet> randominternetus: sounds like a "slick" event.
[06:10:59] <randominternetus> let me try.
[06:11:23] <randominternetus> wait you mean there's a event names slick or it's slick slider's event?
[06:11:29] <randominternetus> named*
[06:11:38] <Woet> randominternetus: theres no event called "beforeChange" in jQuery
[06:11:58] <Woet> just "change", which refers to input fields.
[06:12:13] <randominternetus> whatever. what event should I use for my issue?
[06:12:49] <Woet> ask whatever library your question is about.
[06:14:04] <randominternetus> it's slickjs
[06:14:12] <randominternetus> I'm not sure if it has a community
[06:14:43] <Woet> it has plenty of documentation at least.
[06:15:33] <Woet> none of which mentions "onChange"
[06:17:29] <randominternetus> oh right. found it!
[06:49:48] <joao> hello

[12:16:48] <robertmaxrees> erm
[12:17:00] <robertmaxrees> well that was annoying
[12:17:04] <taplar> lots of spam today, network wide
[12:17:40] <robertmaxrees> litewait "my pagination gets scrunched"??
[12:18:08] <litewait> meaning first/last/pagination numbers are all overlapped. can’t read them.
[12:18:19] <robertmaxrees> so there's a css issue?
[12:18:43] <litewait> yeah not sure how datables handles that not clean from the docs.
[12:18:49] <litewait> clear
[12:18:56] <zodd>  I have a <div id=¨resultbox¨><span class=¨message¨>  and some ajax-code elsewhere which issues a: $.ajax({ url: ´/dyt´, data $(´form´).serialize(), type: ´POST´, success: function(response) {
[12:18:57] <zodd> next I would like to print the output/response into the resultbox
[12:19:07] <zodd> I tried $(´.message´, ´#resultbox´) = response; but that fails
[12:19:09] <robertmaxrees> litewait i'd just up #css in that case :)
[12:19:18] <zodd> what is the correct way to do this please?
[12:19:40] <robertmaxrees> zodd you're justy trying to target the .message in #resultbox?
[12:19:44] <robertmaxrees> *just
[12:20:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:22:22] <taplar> little jar jar slipped in there
[12:22:46] <robertmaxrees> zodd ?
[12:22:52] <zodd> robertmaxrees, correct
[12:23:01] <robertmaxrees> zodd the same way you would with CSS.
[12:24:55] <robertmaxrees> zodd are yopu not familiar with how to do that?
[12:29:32] <zodd> robertmaxrees, no I am not. I fail to see how to get the result in there. I was looking at Jquery load but that is not helpful as I already have the result
[12:29:39] <robertmaxrees> $('#resultbox .message')
[12:29:49] <robertmaxrees> ^ same thing as CSS>
[12:29:57] <zodd> ah. trivial
[12:30:03] <robertmaxrees> right heh.
[12:35:04] <zodd> robertmaxrees, but how to assign a value there? $('#resultbox .message') = response; fails
[12:35:15] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[12:35:21] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to set the text of that?
[12:36:35] <zodd> yes I am
[12:36:49] <taplar> To understand why it is failing, consider the following:  var x = $('#resultbox .message');  x = 3;
[12:37:05] <taplar> ^ do you understand what that is doing?
[12:37:47] <zodd> yes. I think so. X = value taken from resultbox. Next value is changed, yet resultbox remains the same
[12:37:59] <taplar> not taken from
[12:38:06] <taplar> x is being made to point to it
[12:38:14] <zodd> k
[12:38:18] <taplar> the second assignment is making x point to something different
[12:38:19] <robertmaxrees> you use .text() to set the text.
[12:38:31] <zodd> ok. makes sense
[12:38:35] <taplar> but that doesn't change anything about what x originally pointed to
[12:38:41] <taplar> it just changes x
[12:39:14] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:45:07] <zodd> Hmm. I end up with uncaught reference errors.
[12:45:38] <robertmaxrees> zodd show us your code.
[12:46:39] <zodd> ty robertmaxrees, but that is quite a lot and it is also unrunable as it ir dockerized and working with flask (python)
[12:46:53] <robertmaxrees> zodd erm, i don't need your backend.
[12:46:57] <robertmaxrees> just your frontend.
[12:46:59] <robertmaxrees> but OK.
[12:47:09] <taplar> and really just the part that you are getting the error from
[12:47:13] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:47:31] <zodd> so I presume the .css the .html and the .js file?
[12:47:47] <robertmaxrees> just the relevant js and httl.
[12:47:48] <taplar> for starters, just the line of code you are changing
[12:47:50] <robertmaxrees> *html
[12:47:52] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[12:48:02] <robertmaxrees> jsut need to see what's erroring/
[12:48:57] <zodd> http://paste.debian.net/1035144/
[12:49:09] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[12:49:10] <zodd> http://paste.debian.net/1035145/
[12:49:16] <robertmaxrees> lol.  css won't throw referenceerrors
[12:49:39] <zodd> nope. the js does
[12:49:55] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:50:01] <robertmaxrees> so where in your CS is the error coming from?
[12:50:47] <zodd> the second paste is the JS which handles 2 buttons. My HTML has 2 div textboxes with a line of text
[12:50:47] <robertmaxrees> *js
[12:51:07] <robertmaxrees> right, so what line is the JS error coming from?
[12:51:09] <zodd> the reset-ocr button tries to update them both
[12:51:52] <zodd> all lines (including this one) which look like: $('#dropbox .message').text() = 'Drop image here to upload.';
[12:52:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:52:02] <robertmaxrees> nonononono
[12:52:08] <robertmaxrees> .text('new text here')
[12:52:10] <robertmaxrees> it's a method.
[12:52:16] <zodd> ok.
[12:55:47] <zodd> cool. all works now. Thanks!
[12:56:02] <robertmaxrees> i'd check out learn.jquery.com btw

[13:19:14] <robertmaxrees> they're getting faster with the bans
[13:19:41] <taplar> so you're not having to do it?
[13:20:06] <robertmaxrees> plus my bans would only do so much.
[13:21:32] <ca1ek> how to stop jquery from removing whitespace when constructing a new element with $("<div>...")
[13:21:48] <robertmaxrees> ca1ek what's the whitespace it's removing?
[13:22:00] <ca1ek> I add an element like this $('<a href="#" id="'+ thread.id +'">'+ thread.id +'</a> - '+ thread.replies.toString().padStart(4) +'<br>')
[13:22:12] <ca1ek> the spaces added by the left pad don't show up
[13:22:20] <ca1ek> if I add spaces manually they won't show up as well
[13:22:23] <taplar> that's typical of html
[13:22:26] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:22:44] <robertmaxrees> whitespace is generally not significant until it is.
[13:22:55] <ca1ek> wha, i remember not having this issue before doing something similar I think
[13:22:59] <ca1ek> so how do I work around this
[13:23:02] <taplar> you can either force a space with &nbsp; , or better yet, apply a style that adds some margin or spacing on the side
[13:23:05] <robertmaxrees> well first off.
[13:23:17] <robertmaxrees> ^^^ nvm taplar beat me to it.
[13:23:43] <taplar> from a sematic standpoint, you want to do this with css
[13:24:11] <ca1ek> I'm using a monospace font and trying to emulate something of a terminal window, I won't bother with css for this
[13:24:30] <taplar> ok, then another option would also be to put it in a <pre> tag
[13:24:47] <ca1ek> it's not actual code, it's just meant to look like it
[13:24:54] <ca1ek> can i have hyperlinks in <pre>?
[13:24:57] <taplar> sure
[13:25:10] <taplar> <pre> just forces the contents to not disregard whitespace
[13:26:24] <ca1ek> I think i will use that because .padStart(4, "&nbsp;") did something that i exactly didn't want
[13:26:56] <robertmaxrees> inserted &nbsp;?
[13:26:57] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:27:23] <ca1ek> &nb10, &nbs7 and so on
[13:28:32] <robertmaxrees> yeah, because you were entering text, not character entities :)
[13:30:49] <ca1ek> javascript's execution order doesn't make sense
[13:30:58] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:31:02] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[13:32:06] <ca1ek> I went to ##javascript to ask, but, I tried .append("<pre>"), then a for loop listing all the threads, then .append("</pre>") at the end
[13:32:16] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:32:18] <ca1ek> but the first line runs, then the last line, then the for loop
[13:32:19] <robertmaxrees> you can't do that :)
[13:32:20] <taplar> :)
[13:32:37] <robertmaxrees> .append('<pre>') is going to append $('<pre></pre>')
[13:32:45] <ca1ek> well I guess I can't seeing that it doesn't work
[13:33:02] <robertmaxrees> so it's in order.
[13:33:14] <ca1ek> i don't like control being taken away from me, how can I make it actually do what I want
[13:33:18] <robertmaxrees> it's not.
[13:33:31] <taplar> you are misunderstanding what it is doing
[13:33:45] <ca1ek> well it's closing the tag because it guesses i forgot that
[13:33:51] <robertmaxrees> var $myPre = $('<pre>');  $myPre.append('the Text'); $myTarget.append($myPre);
[13:33:55] <taplar> because you are appending dom elements
[13:33:59] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[13:34:00] <taplar> not html
[13:34:26] <robertmaxrees> ^ and dom nodes can't be unclosed.
[13:35:03] <ca1ek> hm, makes sense now
[13:36:01] <ca1ek> thanks!

[15:00:27] <SideFX> I  have a form with many <input>'s, is there a way to have jquery run a function whenever any input loses focus?
[15:00:49] <taplar> you can bind a blur handler to them
[15:00:55] <SideFX> I'm basically trying to have some fields auto fill with math
[15:01:04] <SideFX> Do I have to bind one to each one individually?
[15:01:08] <SideFX> There's like 100 fields
[15:01:23] <taplar> you could also make it a delegate, if blur events bubble, one sec.
[15:01:34] <robertmaxrees> blur in jquery land bubbles.
[15:01:49] <taplar> ahh, sweet, so there ya go
[15:01:56] <taplar> mdn was saying they didn't
[15:02:28] <SideFX> I'm not familiar with bubble
[15:02:55] <SideFX> so like I can use the form id for blur?
[15:03:04] <taplar> bubbling, also known as propagation, refers to an event originating from a child, being processed by the parents
[15:03:30] <taplar> events that propagate process by the element, then by it's parent, then by that elements parent, and so on and so forth
[15:03:58] <taplar> so since blur bubbles for jquery, you can use it in a delegate
[15:04:10] <taplar> $(parentSelector).on('blur', childSelector, eventHandler)
[15:05:02] <SideFX> Ooh I see

[15:38:31] <solidfox> hello, I need to bind click to the document multiple times with the same handler, but with different data for each bind
[15:39:25] <solidfox> $(document).on('click.Namespace1', data1, handler); $(document).on('click.Namespace2', data2, handler);
[15:39:44] <solidfox> that is what I'm trying so far and it seems only data2 is accessible on both events firing
[15:39:58] <solidfox> so I guess that doesn't work huh?
[15:41:52] <taplar> the second argument there is meant to be the child selector
[15:42:54] <taplar> so if you look at the api, it shows the pattern is .on( events [, selector ] [, data ], handler )
[15:43:40] <taplar> unless you are trying not to use a delegate?
[15:44:49] <solidfox> taplar: I think it determines which argument it is by type. in the api, it says selector is a String
[15:44:53] <solidfox> data is not a string
[15:45:14] <solidfox> hm
[15:45:17] <taplar> then can you make a fiddle showing the issue?
[15:45:28] <solidfox> let me try null as child selector like you said.
[15:45:47] <taplar> or '*'
[15:46:47] <robertmaxrees> trying to pass extra data through .on()?
[15:47:25] <solidfox> robertmaxrees: yes
[15:51:01] <solidfox> taplar: ok, I've confirmed that it doesn't matter if I pass null '*' or omit selector entirely. the data is still always the last data I pass into a $(document).on()
[15:51:50] <solidfox> im going to leave it as null for clarity
[15:52:12] <taplar> so yeah, i'd be interested in seeing an example.  especially around how data1 and data2 are defined
[16:00:55] <solidfox> taplar: seems to work in js fiddle, I wonder if its because I'm on an old version. https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/485632/
[16:01:15] <taplar> what version?
[16:02:57] <solidfox> 2.2.3
[16:05:32] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/fg5shL0m/   changed the jquery version to 2.2.3
[16:07:23] <solidfox> :/
[16:07:29] <solidfox> well at least I know its possible
[16:17:47] <solidfox> taplar: I was debugging right before the event is created, and every time the data was different outside of the handler.

[16:25:21] <taplar> I think the most annoying part of all this is that I see my irc client say there is activity and I go "yaaaaah!!!" and then .... "awwww"

[16:53:06] <thisisbilly23> This message was brought to you by Private Internet Access
[17:15:48] <ASUchander> Is there any fundamental issue (besides the fact that it is old) that jquery 2.2.3 ought not to be used?  I'm just trying to figure out whether a developer decision is justified..
[17:16:11] <taplar> browser support is the consideration
[17:16:23] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:16:29] <taplar> 3x dropped support for IE < 9 I believe
[17:16:33] <robertmaxrees> but also
[17:16:45] <robertmaxrees> newer versions of browsers may or may not be properly supported by the older versions.
[17:17:07] <ASUchander> Are there particular browsers (today) that 2.2.3 won't support?
[17:17:19] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[17:17:43] <robertmaxrees> just that the 2.x and 1.x versions aren't tested against newer browsers.
[17:17:55] <robertmaxrees> ASUchander though to be 100% fair, this entire conversation is moot :)
[17:18:06] <ASUchander> robertmaxrees: ?

[17:18:20] <ASUchander> how it moot?
[17:18:20] <jfmcarreira5> This message was brought to you by Private Internet Access
[17:18:45] <robertmaxrees> ASUchander look at your analytics.
[17:18:51] <robertmaxrees> what browsers do you need to support.
[17:18:57] <robertmaxrees> and what issues are you having?
[17:19:38] <ASUchander> robertmaxrees: to be honest, no issues, and the browsers I need are supported perfectly fine.  I just want to make sure that if we go forward with the 2.x version that we're not setting ourselves up for something bad.
[17:19:52] <ASUchander> As opposed to putting the time/effort into upgrading today.
[17:19:58] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:19:59] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[17:20:15] <robertmaxrees> i'm lost - are you upgrading to 2.x?
[17:20:24] <ASUchander> No.  Looking at deploying 2.x
[17:20:43] <taplar> Brand new implementation?
[17:20:43] <robertmaxrees> from...?
[17:20:46] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:20:51] <ASUchander> instead of spending the time to upgrade the underlying code to 3.x
[17:21:02] <taplar> upgrade suggests you are already using a version of jquery
[17:21:05] <robertmaxrees> are you maintaining 2.x?
[17:21:20] <ASUchander> A new deployment, but a third party product which uses 2.x (and is the basis for this new stuff.)
[17:21:32] <robertmaxrees> aaaaah
[17:21:40] <robertmaxrees> in that case follow what the vendor says
[17:22:05] <CompanionCube|> Hey, I thought you guys might be interested in this blog by freenode staff member Bryan 'kloeri' Ostergaard https://bryanostergaard.com/
[17:22:05] <CompanionCube|> or maybe this blog by freenode staff member Matthew 'mst' Trout https://MattSTrout.com/
[17:22:05] <CompanionCube|> Read what IRC investigative journalists have uncovered on the freenode pedophilia scandal https://encyclopediadramatica.rs/Freenodegate
[17:22:06] <ASUchander> We have the source - so we can upgrade it before we deploy probably.  The vendor doesn't want to upgrade...mainly because I suspect it would cost them time/money.
[17:22:33] <taplar> worst case scenario, you upgrade the version past what they provide, and their product stops working.  in which case, good luck getting support for that, i would imagine
[17:22:39] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:22:46] <robertmaxrees> just deploy what they support.
[17:22:48] <robertmaxrees> call it a day.
[17:23:18] <taplar> however, just because they include v2 doesn't mean you can't use a newer version.  you'd just have to run it in noConflict
[17:23:36] <robertmaxrees> ^ and there's no guarantee it'll work.
[17:23:44] <robertmaxrees> unless their codebase includes 2.x explicitly.
[17:23:45] <ASUchander> lol.  So aside from the fact that it's not tested with modern browsers, there's no real technical reason not to deploy it.
[17:23:48] <robertmaxrees> in which case, i'd leave it alone.
[17:23:52] <robertmaxrees> aye.
[17:23:59] <robertmaxrees> you want their support - don't touch their codebase :)
[17:24:11] <ASUchander> robertmaxrees: there's no support, that's why we have their code
[17:24:16] <ASUchander> hence...
[17:24:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:24:32] <robertmaxrees> is this a 3rd party that went under or something?
[17:24:56] <ASUchander> It's a third party that moved on to other stuff and doesn't want to support it basically.  One man shop I believe.
[17:25:17] <robertmaxrees> i'd still not change anything tbh.
[17:25:24] <ASUchander> ok, thx
[17:25:25] <robertmaxrees> don't make things harder than you need to.
[17:25:26] <taplar> i'd start looking for an alternative
[17:25:30] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[17:25:36] <robertmaxrees> long term ++++++
[17:25:42] <ASUchander> taplar: yeah, I'm just the low man on the totem pole.
[17:25:54] <ASUchander> but I've made that recommendation already.
[17:26:04] <robertmaxrees> why do dev orgs make people feel like that???
[17:26:14] <robertmaxrees> there should be no "low man on the totem pole" :(
[17:26:16] <taplar> It can help if you can show them the alternative
[17:26:59] <ASUchander> taplar: Well, the whole idea was to determine if there was a fundamental issue of deploying an old version.  If there isn't, then that's great (sort of) for now.
[17:27:14] <taplar> sure
[17:27:17] <robertmaxrees> for now
[17:27:22] <robertmaxrees> but long-term :)
[17:28:06] <taplar> especially since as browsers progress and jQuery is refactored to take advantage of it, the longer you stay on an older version the longer you are missing out on those benifits
[17:28:14] <taplar> and potential bug fixes
[17:28:18] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:33:42] <ASUchander> thx taplar and robertmaxrees

[18:18:35] <taplar> ah
[18:28:18] <robertmaxrees> surprised there's nothing on the blog or twitter about it.
[18:29:12] <taplar> it does make you wonder how they're trying to remedy it
[18:30:06] <robertmaxrees> they're using https://github.com/freenode/Sigyn
[19:57:09] <lipsum-p> Hey guys
[19:58:18] <lipsum-p> When a button is clicked, one div I have gets a class
[19:58:33] <lipsum-p> Is it possible to add some snippet of code to the URL that will keep the window open?
[19:58:55] <Woet> lipsum-p: ..?
[19:58:58] <lipsum-p> So basically, www.website.com/url will lead to the page with the popup closed
[19:59:08] <lipsum-p> www.website.com/url?openpopup1
[19:59:18] <lipsum-p> Will add a class to a div
[20:00:18] <Woet> lipsum-p: yes, that's possible.
[20:01:20] <lipsum-p> Okay, now, to make things tricky
[20:01:30] <lipsum-p> I have a bunch of user-generated boxes
[20:01:42] <lipsum-p> Each box already pulls up a wordpress post in a div with ajax
[20:01:45] <lipsum-p> When clicked
[20:02:11] <lipsum-p> How do I already open the appropriate div
[20:02:25] <Woet> lipsum-p: what have you tried so far?
[20:02:30] <lipsum-p> Nothing
[20:02:35] <lipsum-p> I can't wrap my head around it
[20:02:56] <lipsum-p> Since the content is basically random I can't just use fixed class names to do this
[20:03:38] <Woet> lipsum-p: time to put more thought into it then
[20:03:49] <lipsum-p> yeah, fuck you
[20:04:13] <lipsum-p> i wish stackoverflow had responses like "EYYY JUST THINK ABOUT IT SOME MORE"
[20:04:22] <Woet> lipsum-p: perhaps you should ask useful questions?
[20:04:28] <lipsum-p> Wordpress plugins that only play ADHD music that stimulate thinking
[20:04:34] <Woet> lipsum-p: rather than some weird solution you thought of
[20:04:50] <lipsum-p> it's not mine
[20:11:19] <spaces> LOL windows defender sees content from this channel in my logs as HTML virus :P
[20:14:29] <spaces> lipsum-p stackoverflow sucks with those regulars there
[20:16:43] <Woet> stackoverflow is great if you put actual effort into reading the documentation, making an effort, and only asking when those both fail
[20:16:54] <Woet> something you're not very familiar with spaces
[20:19:47] <lipsum-p> Ehh
[20:19:59] <lipsum-p> Here is a very awful example of what I'm trying to do
[20:20:00] <lipsum-p> http://jsfiddle.net/cemw1dj0/8/
[20:20:12] <lipsum-p> A complete shitshow
[20:20:41] <Woet> lipsum-p: so what is the actual goal? what is this script supposed to be doing?
[20:21:07] <lipsum-p> Once an URL is loaded with ?SOMETHING, AJAX will load contents of the page on www.mysite.com/pages/something into a div
[20:21:56] <lipsum-p> So if you visit www.mysite.com/skjekdjf/dkj?SOMETHING, AJAX will load contents of www.mysite.com/pages/something into #update-popup-inner
[20:21:56] <Woet> yes, we got that already. why?
[20:22:02] <lipsum-p> I wish I knew
[20:22:23] <lipsum-p> I'm just the monkey that's supposed to implement it
[20:22:35] <Woet> maybe if you knew you'd understand the underlying idea and know how to implement it properly
[20:22:58] <lipsum-p> I mean, I don't know jQuery so that's a bigger hurdle
[20:23:04] <Woet> perhaps start there
[20:24:44] <lipsum-p> Look man, I swear it's one guy always posting the same junk, whenever I run into a problem, it's always "START READING JQUERY", I don't have the time to read jQuery, this is a problem I have to solve now, I'm not doing this as a hobby leisure tweak
[20:24:57] <lipsum-p> If you're unable to explain how to do this, or don't want to, that's fine
[20:25:05] <lipsum-p> I'll look elsewhere
[20:25:14] <Woet> so you want us to do your job for you?
[20:25:20] <Woet> how much is your budget?
[20:25:59] <lipsum-p> I think you're well aware that's crap
[20:26:28] <Woet> well, no
[20:26:38] <Woet> its not
[20:26:39] <lipsum-p> Because if minor pointers with code are supposed to be billable, why not mute the entire channel
[20:26:46] <Woet> its not a minor pointer
[20:26:55] <Woet> you're trying to write jquery without knowing jquery
[20:26:59] <lipsum-p> I'm not asking to build it
[20:27:10] <lipsum-p> you to build it*
[20:27:54] <lipsum-p> But saying "start learning jQuery" offers zero help and is lazy, it defeats the purpose of the channel
[20:28:34] <Woet> the entire purpose of this channel is to *help you learn jQuery*
[20:29:20] <lipsum-p> Well that's all I'm looking for m8
[20:29:28] <lipsum-p> A way to learn how to solve this particular problem
[20:29:38] <lipsum-p> I've googled it but probably I'm not using the right terms
[20:30:13] <Woet> ok, so what is the problem?
[20:30:18] <Woet> you've only mentioned what you're trying to do
[20:30:22] <Woet> not what the problem is
