[14:48:30] <djbozzz> Hi all -- I have an listener on an input field and want to update a field in a nested object I have an ID that I give the input field on a data attribute -- when an event occurs I use breadth first search to find the id and update the value. Is there an easier way to update the value of the obj w/out doing breadth/depth search
[14:50:42] <djbozzz> input is created based on some JSON data that comes up -- so is the object
