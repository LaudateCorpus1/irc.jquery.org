[00:01:58] <unnotused> someone please help me, save me this headache, i can't for the life of me find a good form builder. something a stupid user can go to make a form for other stupid users to fill out
[00:02:40] <unnotused> text boxes, text areas, radio buttons, check boxes, text for instructions, drop down (select) and a damn file uploader
[00:02:51] <unnotused> im ready to stab a penguin here guys
[01:39:42] <BenderRodriguez> huh
[01:40:09] <BenderRodriguez> unnotused: like an interactive form builder?
[01:40:21] <unnotused> yarp
[01:40:40] <BenderRodriguez> you could probably use jquery ui with draggable elements
[01:40:51] <BenderRodriguez> or are you looking for a plugin?
[01:42:23] <BenderRodriguez> just create a list of named draggable elements representing the form controls and let the user drag them into a div and order it
[01:42:43] <BenderRodriguez> then  I suppose read the div structure and attribute info to output a complete form in the end
[01:43:07] <BenderRodriguez> or the form source, rather
[01:44:50] <BenderRodriguez> unnotused: does that make sense?
[01:50:45] <unnotused> meh
[01:50:53] <unnotused> i started making my own plugin
[01:51:03] <unnotused> there are two that almost do what i want
[01:51:11] <unnotused> but one has a huge vuln in the file upload
[01:51:28] <unnotused> and the other doesn't have a file upload, and the order of the elements are messed up
[02:11:30] <Mark____> im getting a ‘No Access-Control-Allow_Origin header is present on the requested resource.’ error
[03:04:07] <unnotused> is .each async?
[03:04:16] <unnotused> if so, is there a way to make it not
[03:47:45] <Uhkis> unnotused: its not
[03:48:04] <unnotused> i am sorting my object by a value
[03:48:12] <unnotused> and i can't figure out for the freaking life of me
[03:48:19] <unnotused> but the order keeps being undone
[03:48:41] <unnotused> here is the specific plugin https://github.com/viveleroi/jquery.formbuilder
[03:49:35] <unnotused> its a diffrent order every time
[03:49:44] <unnotused> which is what got me thinking of async
[04:16:46] <nilsi> Can someone help me setup click listeners to this box. Cant set it to the overlay. Only works for the product div itself but need to do separate actions for clicking the heart and outside heart.

[04:26:52] <Voyage> Hi
[04:28:09] <Voyage> I see document.ready does not FULLy waits for the document to load. I mean I have a script that waits for page to load and get its total height. But I have few things that load after html had been loaded. e.g via javascript. That does not gives correct height. Is there a more exact function instead of document.ready?
[04:32:15] <unnotused> nilsi, container to hold, then use on("click", function(e){ if ( e.target != this){ return}; alert('blah')  use the little heart as an overlay only
[04:32:36] <unnotused> Voyage, are you manipulating the dom after initial load?
[04:33:03] <unnotused> what does your code look like to get the page height?
[04:33:31] <Voyage> unnotused,  yes. a JS is changing dom automaticaly after page load. This effects the page height
[04:33:56] <Voyage> unnotused,  height = document.getElementById("page-wrapper").clientHeight;
[04:34:22] <unnotused> if you are altering the dom after that call i don't understand what you are trying to achieve
[04:35:01] <Voyage> unnotused,  achieve: get page height after all things are loaded (images, js, js actions)
[04:35:43] <Voyage> strange that jQuery(window).onload(function () {   is just not working.  document.ready is
[04:35:54] <Voyage> with non-exact height of course
[04:37:25] <unnotused> var height = $('#page-wrapper").clientHeight; $('#page-wrapper').clientHeight.resize(function(){ height = $('#page-wrapper') });
[04:37:27] <unnotused> try that
[04:37:40] <hellyeah> morning
[04:37:44] <unnotused> HELLYEAH
[04:37:47] <unnotused> oh mygod
[04:37:49] <unnotused> its morning?
[04:37:50] <hellyeah> sup mate
[04:37:57] <hellyeah> morning here xD
[04:37:59] <unnotused> WHY IS IT MORNING?
[04:38:07] <hellyeah> hahaha
[04:38:08] <unnotused> i havent slept going on day 3
[04:38:14] <hellyeah> it is night there?
[04:38:17] <unnotused> neeeeeeeeeed morar coffee
[04:38:25] <unnotused> -5
[04:38:27] <unnotused> EST
[04:38:43] <hellyeah> unnotused:  how did you stay awaken 3 days
[04:38:44] <hellyeah> ?
[04:38:57] <unnotused> coffee
[04:38:59] <unnotused> tired
[04:39:04] <unnotused> meh
[04:39:05] <Voyage> unnotused,  it will just resize instantaniously. Without waiting for the other javascript to change things
[04:39:34] <unnotused> yeah
[04:39:36] <unnotused> exactly
[04:40:06] <unnotused> Voyage, .resize is just short for .on("resize")
[04:40:08] <Voyage> but I want to wait for all thigns
[04:40:25] <hellyeah> do you know about jquery ui?
[04:40:26] <unnotused> how do YOU know when it is done?
[04:40:38] <unnotused> hellyeah
[04:40:41] <Voyage> ya, thats my question
[04:41:00] <unnotused> Voyage lol if you are editing the dom after page load, how do you KNOW? when it is done ?
[04:41:17] <unnotused> i don't think you get what i am asking here
[04:41:33] <unnotused> are you doing an ajax request?
[04:41:40] <unnotused> what are you pushing into the dom?
[04:42:01] <hellyeah> when you drag and drop button onto another one there is a space in the left side how can i fix that http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/69/
[04:42:59] <hellyeah> any idea about that?
[04:44:35] <Voyage> unnotused,  thats whats the problem :)
[04:44:44] <unnotused> hellyeah, what space?
[04:45:14] <unnotused> Voyage: YOU need to pick the time when the dom is done with its edits, if you are loading something via ajax, use the .done()
[04:45:15] <hellyeah> did you drop button onto another one?
[04:45:21] <unnotused> hellyeah, hellyeah
[04:45:36] <hellyeah> okey in the left side there is a big space
[04:45:38] <wa5ted> hey
[04:46:23] <hellyeah> hey wa5ted
[04:46:46] <hellyeah> unnotused:  didnt you see that?
[04:47:34] <hellyeah> firewall avoids me to join upload image site
[04:47:36] <hellyeah> damn it
[04:48:37] <unnotused> hellyeah, -ul
[04:48:49] <Voyage> unnotused,  ok
[04:48:49] <Voyage> let me try
[04:49:40] <unnotused> ul, menu, dir{ -webkit-padding-start:40px; }
[04:50:37] <unnotused> hellyeah: try adding ul{padding:0;}
[04:50:45] <unnotused> does that get rid of the space you are talking about?
[04:51:01] <unnotused> Voyage is it a ajax request or not?
[04:51:07] <unnotused> wa5ted : sup
[04:51:22] <Voyage> unnotused,  no, its just a comment box created by js
[04:51:38] <unnotused> your js?
[04:52:22] <Voyage> yes
[04:52:24] <Voyage> unnotused,  TypeError: jQuery(...).clientHeight is undefined
[04:52:25] <Voyage> 	
[04:52:25] <Voyage> jQuery('#page-wrapper').clientHeight.resize(function(){ height = jQuery('#page-w..

[05:34:44] <werwd2> Hi there, I have a find function whos result I store in a variable. On some pages the var(obj) might be empty, so I run it trough Jquery.isEmptyObject(var). For some reason it always returns false, the var contains [], it's empty
[05:34:46] <werwd2> Why is this so?
[06:25:39] <Voyage> unnotused,  thanks a lot. I had to send the height and the resend it after 5 seconds (when page was fully loaded + dom via js). This solved the issue
[06:32:56] <hellyeah> unnotused:  are you there?
[06:43:52] <hellyeah> anyone around
[07:04:35] <veverak> hi folks, I have callback on input edit (...  .on('input',  ...), but it launches ajax query against server
[07:05:06] <veverak> what is common way to programm some limit to not launch that query pointlessly several times?
[07:05:27] <veverak> I mean, I would like to launch the ajax query let's say 1s after non-activity in that input
[07:54:06] <shoky> veverak: that's called "debounce", it's common to use a debounce plugin/function for that
[07:54:15] <veverak> ok
[08:26:43] <hellyeah> question
[08:27:01] <jurkan> answer
[08:27:30] <hellyeah> i try to add buttonclose to droppablediv. droppablediv is created when you drop button onto another button but i couldnt append it what a i doin wrong here?  http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/80/
[08:28:20] <hellyeah> any suggestion?
[08:29:13] <jurkan> hellyeah: Do you just want to append the class "buttonclose"?
[08:29:42] <jurkan> Because I see no element with that class already existing that the selector would match?
[08:30:13] <hellyeah> well
[08:30:23] <hellyeah> scrooll down in result panel you will see x
[08:30:37] <hellyeah> i have .buttonclose::after
[08:30:50] <hellyeah> and in htm there is buttonclose
[08:31:22] <hellyeah> damn
[08:31:24] <hellyeah> sorry
[08:31:59] <hellyeah> jurkan:  http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/81/
[08:32:29] <hellyeah> i fixed the typo
[08:34:35] <hellyeah> anything?
[08:34:40] <jurkan> http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/81/
[08:34:42] <jurkan> Like that?
[08:34:58] <jurkan> You're creating a new droppablediv but haven't added it to the DOM yet
[08:35:07] <jurkan> But still you're trying to select it via a DOM selector
[08:35:17] <jurkan> So I changed line 52
[08:36:24] <hellyeah> are you sure you gave me corrent adfdress
[08:36:29] <hellyeah> no changes here
[08:36:53] <jurkan> Oh sorry, try again
[08:37:33] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:37:35] <jurkan> hmm7
[08:37:37] <jurkan> Anyways
[08:37:46] <jurkan> It's only line 52 to $('.boxclose').clone().appendTo(div2);
[08:38:12] <jurkan> Because, as I said, div2 isn't added to the DOM at that point, so the selector that was there before wouldn't match.
[08:38:46] <hellyeah> okey i changed let me try
[08:39:30] <hellyeah> yeha
[08:39:52] <hellyeah> i guess it is because lack of practice :XD
[08:40:27] <hellyeah> btw
[08:41:01] <hellyeah> when you append html element to dynamic object what is created by using js yo use clone().appendTo() right
[08:42:16] <jurkan> If you want to append a copy of an existing HTML element to some other element, I think so, yes.
[08:43:11] <jurkan> If you'd omit the clone you'd move the existing HTML element instead
[08:43:23] <jurkan> https://api.jquery.com/clone/ <-- There is an example for exactly that situation in the  docs
[08:45:36] <hellyeah> thanks
[08:46:04] <jurkan> np^^
[09:16:48] <RickyB98> hello :-) i'm using jquery validation plugin to validate a form. i have some required fields and a minlength for some other fields, and an equalTo for another field. when i press submit without entering anything, the form does not submit, as expected, and that's fine. but when i enter something in the required fields and getting some errors for the minlength rule, the form gets submitted anyway. i'll paste the code in a while
[09:17:29] <RickyB98> do you like pastebin here?
[09:19:45] <RickyB98> https://jsfiddle.net/RickyB98/tha3qqfw/
[09:20:02] <RickyB98> here it is.. can someone help? couldn't paste the css styles because there's a ton of them.. using bootstrap tho
[10:04:52] <hellyeah> hey
[10:06:31] <hellyeah> i supposed when i drop button div is created and i appended closing button to the droppable div, when i created second div it should add closing button to second droppablediv also because drop is firing each time when i drop button onto another button but it didnt happen like that. Can you help me to figure out why it didnt happen like that http://
[10:06:31] <hellyeah> jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/82/ thanks
[10:11:01] <taplar> $('.boxclose').clone()
[10:11:49] <hellyeah> ah
[10:12:04] <hellyeah> thats right when you append next time you try to append
[10:12:10] <hellyeah> there is no matching element
[10:12:55] <hellyeah> i am stupid
[10:14:52] <Sino> hi all - can anyone help and take a whack at this? descending order sort doesn't work but ascending does: http://jsfiddle.net/kg3rnmjj/1/
[10:14:57] <hellyeah> taplar:  can i ask one more question?
[10:16:01] <taplar> Sino:looks like it's in descending order... ?
[10:16:17] <taplar> hellyeah:it's what the room is here for dude, :)
[10:16:58] <hellyeah> when you create second div you see two closing button x in third you see three closing button http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/85/ why is that
[10:16:59] <Sino> nah when you click it to initialize grouping it doesn't display right
[10:17:22] <taplar> ah
[10:17:28] <taplar> well there is some sort of console error
[10:18:37] <hellyeah> console error?
[10:18:54] <taplar> that was directed at Sino
[10:19:16] <hellyeah> sorry
[10:19:29] <Sino> yeah setting "bsort": false gets rid of it, but then you can't sort it been trying to figure the error out beyond that
[10:20:07] <taplar> Sino:ok, so clicking the sort causes the second column to group like elements.
[10:20:49] <Sino> yup
[10:21:26] <Sino> its weird though that it displays fine in ascending order, but not descending
[10:22:02] <taplar> brb guys, got a update on my laptop forcing a reboot
[10:36:57] <taplar> hellyeah:your issue is related to the line I pasted from your logic
[10:37:14] <hellyeah> i fixed that it with two ways
[10:37:35] <hellyeah> let me show you
[10:38:09] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/87/
[10:38:17] <krastavac> is there server side proxy to strip cross-origin header so I can load external site in my iframe?

[10:38:36] <hellyeah> which one is better what do you think?
[10:41:08] <taplar> 86 is slightly better
[12:17:44] <RickyB98> hello :-) i'm using jquery validation plugin to validate a form. i have some required fields and a minlength for some other fields, and an equalTo for another field. when i press submit without entering anything, the form does not submit, as expected, and that's fine. but when i enter something in the required fields and getting some errors for the minlength rule, the form gets submitted anyway.

[13:57:17] <wachpwnski-mobi> How can I change a var that is defined outside of an ajax request inside the ajax request?
[13:57:56] <NoiseEee> change it before you make the request?
[14:01:05] <wachpwnski-mobi> NoiseEee:  I am using data from the request to change it.
[14:02:02] <NoiseEee> so presumably you should have a callback function like  changeMyStuff(data) {}   which receives 'data' from the xhr request
[14:02:10] <NoiseEee> wachpwnski-mobi: or pastebin some example of your code
[14:08:49] <wachpwnski-mobi> alright, so like a function that i call that makes the ajax request?
[14:09:27] <NoiseEee> wachpwnski-mobi: you want to change the variable after the ajax request or before it?
[14:09:38] <NoiseEee> wachpwnski-mobi: do you have sample code you can put on a pastebin
[14:10:53] <wachpwnski-mobi> let me cut it up so it makes sense and post it.
[14:15:46] <wachpwnski-mobi> NoiseEee:  http://pastebin.com/Ej3r1kVd
[14:23:29] <NoiseEee> wachpwnski-mobi: what makes you think your comment on line 20 is true?
[14:24:38] <NoiseEee> wachpwnski-mobi: because you need to understand that line 26 likely fires before `currentText` gets changed / the xhr request finishes
[14:24:58] <wachpwnski-mobi> objservation mostly. So if I do console.log currentText on say line 23. it will show the appended data, but when the page renders it does not.
[14:25:54] <wachpwnski-mobi> NoiseEee:  that makes sense! But I did try html.push() within the ajax request, and it doesn't push the appended data either.
[14:26:23] <wachpwnski-mobi> It actually says undefined does not have a 0 index or whatever.
[15:03:16] <Scarecr0w> Anyone home?
[15:04:48] <taplar> sup
[15:06:02] <Scarecr0w> Hello sire, what might be the difference between locally and remotely linking a *.js file?
[15:06:38] <taplar> some remote linking may be disallowed due to cross site restrictions
[15:06:44] <taplar> but other than that, nothing really
[15:07:12] <taplar> with the exception of CDNs, which can potentially increase responsiveness for users.
[15:07:22] <versatiletech> ^ +1
[15:07:39] <versatiletech> was about to mention that
[15:07:52] <Scarecr0w> I've a ghost blog, i recently added Shareholic (social share buttons) in it and i can feel the difference in page load, in a bad way.
[15:08:18] <versatiletech> that’s probably moreso because of Javascript
[15:08:18] <Scarecr0w> If I were to download https://dsms0mj1bbhn4.cloudfront.net/assets/pub/shareaholic.js <-- that file and link it locally, would it make a difference?
[15:08:34] <taplar> it depends on where the time is coming from
[15:08:45] <taplar> server latency vs file size
[15:08:58] <taplar> look at your network tab and see where you time is coming from
[15:09:05] <versatiletech> try moving the script tag for shareaholic before your body tag
[15:09:35] <Scarecr0w> versatiletech: yes sire, i've it before the </body>. taplar: network tab?
[15:09:53] <taplar> no need for the sir
[15:10:01] <taplar> right click on the page and inspect and element
[15:10:02] <Scarecr0w> You mean the timezone or where my server is located?
[15:10:06] <versatiletech> right
[15:10:09] <taplar> it wil popup the dev tools
[15:10:14] <taplar> should be a network tab in there
[15:10:26] <taplar> it will tell you what files are being loaded, from where, and the time spent to get them
[15:11:42] <versatiletech> it could also be that the CDN getting picked up is nowhere near you so the latency is high
[15:11:49] <Scarecr0w> Woah no wonder hahahaha.
[15:11:49] <taplar> ^
[15:12:36] <Scarecr0w> oops, i use Cloudflare as my CDN and was working great until i added Shareholic into my blog. I can see that there's some errors and failures regarding Shareholic stuff.
[15:13:10] <versatiletech> yeah, look into that first
[15:14:24] <NoiseEee> serving resources like JS/CSS from anywhere other than the same domain is generally balls
[15:15:11] <taplar> also if security is any sort of concern you'd want to serve locally
[15:15:18] <Scarecr0w> NoiseEee: :( yes it seems.
[16:06:49] <versatiletech> Just finished a couple of features for an AJAX test server. Wanted to help out front-end developers that would like to work without having to worry about building a backend API first. It’s like echo.jsontest.com, but specifically for front-end developers. I’m looking for ways to improve it. Let me know what you’d like to see. http://ajaxechoserver-2upmedia.rhcloud.com/
[17:31:00] <jquery525> anyone available to help me with something relatively simple?

[17:37:57] <jquery525> i want to reverse this animation when y goes back to being less than 400
[17:37:58] <jquery525> $(document).scroll(function() {   var y = $(this).scrollTop();   if (y > 400) {     $('#nav-fixed').animate({left:'+190px'},1000)
[17:39:07] <shoky> you can't use css transitions?  they usually make this stuff much simpler
[17:39:11] <shoky> you just add and remove a class
[17:39:26] <jquery525> ive never learned transitions
[17:39:50] <shoky> anyways make a jsfiddle showing your problem and we can fix it up
[17:43:31] <shoky> also it looks like you're currently re-animating it on each scroll that's above 400
[17:43:49] <shoky> so you keep queueing more and more animations on each scroll..
[17:46:49] <jquery525> does jsfiddle support scrolltop? it doesnt work for me at all
[17:46:57] <jquery525> https://jsfiddle.net/zhhyazb7/4/

[17:47:56] <shoky> bobbobbins:  how are you using the ID to select it?
[17:48:28] <bobbobbins> shoky: $("#myform").submit();
[17:48:55] <shoky> bobbobbins: oh if it looks like an array it could just be a jquery object. they are array-like
[17:49:09] <shoky> a jquery object is a collection, generally
[17:49:14] <bobbobbins> yeah, thats what it is
[17:49:23] <shoky> and browser consoles can show them as arrays sometimes
[17:49:33] <bobbobbins> if I do $('#myform')[0].submit(); it works, but thats a pain
[17:49:56] <shoky> doing $('#myform').submit()  does the same, but also triggers submit handlers on the form first
[17:51:22] <bobbobbins> hmm
[17:53:17] <shoky> jquery525: btw here's how you can do the same with transitions  https://jsfiddle.net/59f4r9q2/1/
[17:53:29] <jquery525> i really appreciate your help
[17:54:20] <jquery525> its probably worth mentioning that the nav is always visible, i just want it to become centred when someone starts scrolling past a point
[17:54:39] <shoky> oks well that's just css changes
[18:44:22] <unnotused> anyone touch dustjs ?
[21:06:27] <arc_> this is on a steam game detail page. <div onclick="window.location='#app_reviews_hash'"
[21:06:31] <arc_> why in the world would they do this
[21:34:11] <shoky> everybody does weird stuff sometimes :S
[21:34:38] <arc_> i suppose so
[21:35:14] <arc_> it's astounding to me how often i'm trying to select something for a userscript and it doesn't have any class or id whatsoever
[21:36:54] <shoky> many sites use libs/frameworks that build their DOM for them automatically based on templates/scripts,  you don't really need to query the DOM with such solutions (e.g. react, knockout, etc)
[21:37:31] <shoky> and so, you don't really need ID's.  and classes only for css
[21:38:24] <arc_> i see
[21:42:32] <subsonic> any good recommended templating systems?
[22:13:49] <slide> Does anyone know if there is a way to setup specific grid breakpoints for the resizeable element? I'm trying to make it adhere to my existing grid design
[22:18:27] <shibly> Hi, i have a question
[22:18:48] <shibly> https://jsfiddle.net/ghw9qr79/ , this is the $.ajax() code
[22:19:28] <shibly> Typing something on comment form if i click the button it saves comment data into database then append it to div
[22:19:35] <shibly> That's fine.
[22:20:11] <shibly> But will this comment be visible to other end of users, can they see my comments?
[22:20:38] <shibly> Or will this be appended only my end?
[22:23:02] <Geh4> hello, I have one question. Is it possible to click a button embedded in an iFrame music player using jQuery ? is yes, then how, or what's the link to the solution ?
[22:24:28] <arc_> there is a javascript method called click(). whether you can use it to click on something inside an iframe depends on whether it's a cross domain iframe, and if it is, how the server the iframe comes from is configured
[22:26:38] <Geh4> it's the spotify embedded player
[22:27:08] <arc_> then i find it extremely unlikely that you will be able to programmatically click on it
[22:28:19] <Geh4> any ideas on how I can go about controling the play button without pressing spotify's play button ?
[22:30:07] <arc_> is this like ... you've embedded your album on your website and you want it to automatically start playing when someone arrives at the page?
[22:35:27] <Geh4> at the moment, spotify does not allow customization of their music player. I need to customize this player for my page, Iv'e gotten as far as changeing colors and only 'hiding' the album art, but if I can use a button other than what spotify has provided, I can just hide the whole player.
[22:36:03] <arc_> can you link to your page
[22:38:00] <Geh4> the page does not exist as yet, so I cannot. I'm only working in jsfiddle and codepen for now.
[22:38:10] <arc_> jsfiddle would be fine
[22:38:30] <arc_> or whatever is the most updated version
[22:42:21] <Geh4> sure
[22:42:27] <Geh4> https://jsfiddle.net/L71noe1z/
[22:46:58] <arc_> yeah. there is no way to programmatically click this because it's a cross domain iframe
[22:47:13] <arc_> and their server is not set up to allow that
[22:51:19] <Geh4> Ouch, thanks for looking into this !
[22:59:23] <shibly> If someone comments with ajax the comment div will be loaded with new comments, and new comment will be visible to all other user, how can i do it?
[22:59:29] <shibly> Like facebook does
[23:00:12] <bobbobbins> ok, so I'm having a form submission issue in ie8...i recreated it in jsfiddle, but it doesn't like that I'm submitting a form so you have to cut and paste it to recreate it, but here it is: https://jsfiddle.net/bq4srdtg/1/
[23:00:41] <bobbobbins> basically the form submission works when I click on the file field, but not when i click the button to open the file field
[23:00:51] <bobbobbins> I can't figure out why its doing that
[23:02:33] <shibly> Can anyone answer?
