[00:43:41] <mikkelb> Hey!
[00:44:03] <mikkelb> jQuery In Action - is it worth getting?
[00:45:46] <mateus73> Hello guys: jQuery 1.7.1 I am trying to use ".on" and "focusout" but it doesn't work?
[00:47:52] <systemfault> mikkelb: No, jquery evolves too rapidly...
[00:48:36] <systemfault> mateus73: Do you mind writing a test?
[00:49:46] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/BAzhY/ Because that works fine.
[00:53:46] <mateus73> systemfault .. not easy writing a test ..
[00:53:48] <mikkelb> systemfault: Really?
[00:54:03] <mikkelb> But it's written by Yehuda Katz, that guy is a genius
[00:54:06] <mateus73> systemfault by the way .. I think it has to do with event bubble
[00:54:07] <mikkelb> and I basically know 0 jQuery
[00:54:42] <systemfault> mateus73: blur and focus don't bubble.. that's why focusin/focusout exists IIRC
[00:55:00] <mateus73> systemfault ok cool
[00:55:30] <systemfault> mateus73: http://jsfiddle.net/BAzhY/1/
[00:56:25] <systemfault> mikkelb: I love Yehuda and his work on ember.js… but still, jquery evolves so rapidly that the content of that book might already be old :(
[00:56:52] <systemfault> mikkelb: For example, it might not use .on for event handling because it was included in 1.7
[00:58:02] <mikkelb> systemfault: but you gotta take into consideration that we're not at the same level
[00:58:07] <mikkelb> i don't even know what event handling is
[00:58:47] <systemfault> mikkelb: An example… when you click on something, an event happens and you decide to or not to handle it with javascript
[00:59:07] <systemfault> mikkelb: You might benefit from a javascript tutorial if you're serious
[00:59:39] <mikkelb> hmm
[01:00:25] <systemfault> Because in the browser, there's 2 parts… 1) Javascript 2) the Document Object Model (DOM)
[01:00:41] <systemfault> jQuery helps making 2) bearable…. but doesn't help with 1
[01:01:11] <Dr-Bombay> well some
[01:07:28] <mikkelb> cool
[01:13:33] <mateus73> Can someone tell me how to do this better?
[01:13:37] <mateus73> http://jsfiddle.net/juwBN/
[01:14:07] <mateus73> setTimeout there doesn't reall work
[01:15:04] <systemfault> What do you mean by that?
[01:19:12] <Dr-Bombay> not quite getting the concept of jsfiddle there
[01:19:38] <aximilation> what are you trying to do now?
[01:19:46] <mateus73> systemfault does that code look good to you?
[01:19:56] <mateus73> systemfault is about $this object
[01:20:17] <mateus73> systemfault I am not sure that's the right way of passing the object
[01:20:48] <systemfault> mateus73: With the info you gave me.. it looks okay
[01:21:09] <mateus73> systemfault well .. that's all really
[01:21:28] <mateus73> systemfault I'll give another try
[01:21:33] <mateus73> thanks mate
[01:21:40] <systemfault> mateus73: Write a real test :(
[01:21:54] <mateus73> ok
[01:22:59] <systemfault> jsfiddle is a live pastebin, learn to use it because it will become one of your best friends
[01:29:40] <patrickvw> has a "counter" problem and got stuck ...http://jsfiddle.net/patrickvw/VX3mt/14/

[01:54:49] <wodemaye__> Hi... I'm trying to fetch a complete HTML document and obtain the value of a specific meta tag within it... How can this be done?  It seems that a partial solution is in this thread, but it doesn't actually cover my scenario as noted by the last post in it: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-parse-ajax-html-response#14737000002546041
[02:15:47] <Stava> When creating an element with $('<tr></tr>'), it will not be visible until inserted into another element, such as body, right?
[02:17:26] <ravenzz> such as a table
[02:17:28] <ravenzz> :p
[02:17:35] <Stava> in this case, yes :)
[02:17:40] <ravenzz> but tyes
[02:17:42] <ravenzz> -t
[02:17:47] <Stava> great, thanks
[02:25:46] <antnash> Morning guys. I'm trying to set some data on an element in the following way. I'm obviously doing something wrong, but what is it?
[02:25:47] <antnash> upload += '<td id="upload-company-"' + i + '" class="editable uploadtd" data-post="post-company-"' + i + '" >' + data[0] + '</td>';
[02:28:00] <Stava> Would someone kindly refer me to a guide on creating a simple jquery plugin using best practices?
[02:33:03] <rudiX> How to select text inside such tag <label for="id_adress">Adress</label> ?
[02:33:37] <Stava> rudiX: var text = $('#id_address').text();
[02:33:43] <Dr-Bombay> nooooo
[02:33:54] <rudiX> :)
[02:34:14] <Dr-Bombay> $('label[for="id_address"]').text();
[02:34:34] <Stava> You're right, of course
[02:34:35] <rudiX> thanks alot Dr-Bombay
[02:40:31] <smopp> Hi... I'm trying to fetch a complete HTML document and obtain the value of a specific meta tag within it... How can this be done?

[03:04:35] <Stava> If I pass a jQuery object to $(), will it short circuit and immediately return the same object?
[03:05:05] <Mark____> hi
[03:05:08] <Mark____> $(window).height()
[03:05:15] <_cb> I have a small thumbnail div which is hidden. When on  mouseOver  another div I change the coordinates and then  show the thumbnail. Problem is the div is flashing briefly at the bottom of the page before moving. Any ideas how I solve it?
[03:05:19] <Mark____> what is window ?
[03:05:21] <Mark____> $(window).height()
[03:05:41] <Mark____> ?
[03:05:54] <Stava> Mark____: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window
[03:11:34] <xec> Stava: http://jsfiddle.net/MRNg5/
[03:11:50] <xec> Stava: you'll get a new jquery object with the same collection
[03:12:37] <Stava> xec: interesting, thanks
[03:12:39] <xec> Stava: compare to object pointer/reference http://jsfiddle.net/MRNg5/1/
[03:13:30] <Stava> So there is an overhead of doing myElement = $(myElement); if you want to make sure it's a jQuery object
[03:13:40] <xec> yes, albeit quite small
[03:14:02] <Stava> will i look like a noob for doing it?
[03:14:51] <xec> depends on the code really, a lot of times you already know for sure that myElement is a jQuery object, and in that case, yes ;)
[03:16:07] <xec> but if you have a function or something that's supposed to be able to take both jquery objects and dom elements, for instance, personally i'd just slap $() around and be done with it
[03:18:18] <xec> in any case, i'd argue that producing code that is easy to read ("looks like a noob") is almost always better than complex-looking code that does the same job
[03:18:27] <rudiX> how simple selection function looks like? I mean I need to check each repeating element <label> and apply .text() to it
[03:18:59] <xec> rudiX: "repeating element"? as in you want all <label>s on a page?
[03:19:23] <rudiX> xec: yeah but need some if's inside
[03:19:50] <rudiX> using (this).attr('id')
[03:19:58] <xec> what
[03:20:30] <xec> selecting on id is much better, i'd think?
[03:20:49] <rudiX> yeah I know ... but I am a mess :)
[03:21:18] <xec> $("label") will get all labels and $("#myID") will select the label (or any element) with ID "myID"
[03:22:17] <rudiX> i am not sure about the syntax but theoretically is it posible $("label",function(this) {})
[03:22:35] <xec> rudiX: explain exactly what you're trying to do
[03:22:53] <xec> maybe you're looking for .each() ?
[03:23:04] <rudiX> hmm seems legit
[03:23:16] <rudiX> :)
[03:23:24] <xec> ?each @ rudiX
[03:23:25] <bot-t> rudiX, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[03:24:15] <rudiX> $.each('#selector') would that work ?
[03:24:36] <xec> $("label").each(func)
[03:24:41] <ruby_on_tails> rudiX: no
[03:24:57] <xec> will run the function "func" for each label
[03:25:02] <rudiX> ooh thanks guys
[03:25:32] <xec> rudiX: inside that function, "this.id" will return the ID
[03:26:51] <devOlsen> sweet, just made a neat lightweight filmstrip rotator http://jsfiddle.net/eFH92/
[03:31:41] <xec> devOlsen: pretty nice! is this supposed to be like thumbnails for the actual picture? like you can select 1-4 at the start to change what picture you see beneath(or over)?
[03:32:58] <devOlsen> indeed
[03:33:17] <devOlsen> but more focused on building something as basic and lightweight / extendable as possible for our shop.
[03:34:22] <xec> right, the single selected image threw me, i didnt think it was working at first because i was expecting the >> button to move the strip (but it just moved the selected image from 1 to 2 instead) :)
[03:34:47] <xec> but if thats the case then yeah, looks very smooth
[03:35:18] <devOlsen> yeah I was going to build out the option for being able to step multiple images based on the developers needs..
[03:35:42] <devOlsen> but then again, does that make this the most basic approach to build on in later projects.. so I thought not to.
[03:36:21] <xec> yeah i agree, keep it simple and build on it if you need to *when* you need to
[03:36:57] <xec> i keep making the mistake of adding features i never use -.-
[03:37:01] <sviatovigt> what is the best site to learn javascript?
[03:37:10] <devOlsen> google.com ?
[03:37:29] <xec> sviatovigt: have you tried eloquent javascript?
[03:37:49] <sviatovigt> what is eloquent javascript?
[03:37:58] <xec> google it - it's a free online book
[03:38:07] <devOlsen> yeah I always fall for that trap of shiny features I would like to see, vs what really is only the basics for developing on later.
[03:38:45] <rudiX> lightweighting is a trap :)
[03:38:56] <devOlsen> how so?
[03:39:04] <sviatovigt> devOlsen: if you search for html tutorials for example, one of the first examples that comes up is w3schools.org
[03:39:13] <sviatovigt> and as far as I know
[03:39:23] <sviatovigt> that is not a recommended place to learn html
[03:39:33] <rudiX> getting the job done is something I avoid starting to optimize :)
[03:39:47] <sviatovigt> you should've imagine I have searched on  google
[03:40:01] <sviatovigt> the reason I have asked is to see what others think is best
[03:40:11] <rudiX> and the browsers are pretty powerfull enough for my ugly code
[03:40:16] <xec> rudiX: lightweight doesn't necessarily mean performant
[03:40:28] <devOlsen> indeed it means extendability
[03:40:34] <xec> rudiX: it could just mean small codebase = easy to modify
[03:40:51] <rudiX> ic
[03:41:42] <rudiX> sometimes its fun to overcomplicate
[03:42:02] <rudiX> again  - not productive
[03:42:14] <xec> hehe, wise words right there
[03:46:17] <sviatovigt> I have a link with the pattern http://site_name/controller/[action]/[letter:A]/page:1
[03:46:26] <sviatovigt> what is in [] is optional
[03:46:33] <sviatovigt> it might not be in the link
[03:46:53] <sviatovigt> what function/functions should I use to extract 1 from the named parameter page?
[04:51:12] <Sasha_> hi all, i had a quick question about HTTP status codes in jquery
[04:51:28] <Sasha_>  at the moment, the only way jquery detects an error in my AJAX request is if the HTTP status code returned is not 200
[04:51:44] <Sasha_> is there any way to change this? im using a CGI script and having trouble returning a non-200 status code...
[04:51:50] <Sasha_> (its a python script)
[04:53:32] <Sasha_> anyone?
[05:02:37] <Raydiation> can i use the click event multiple times to add more callbacks?

[05:25:31] <huglester> category - is the ID of the select
[05:31:58] <huglester> found it :)
[05:34:37] <sviatovigt> kentaromiura: thanks
[05:35:11] <sviatovigt> my internet connection was down, that is why I didn't responded
[05:35:19] <kentaromiura> sviatovigt: you're welcome
[05:51:50] <kentaromiura> huglester: you found the solution?
[05:52:21] <huglester> kentaromiura: yeah, thanks. was mainly my missunderstanding..
[05:52:26] <kentaromiura> anyway: http://jsfiddle.net/kentaromiura/CDKts/

[06:02:47] <jef_> hi all !
[06:03:48] <jef_> i'm looking for a way to prevent double keydown event in order to wait for the animations are all finished
[06:04:38] <jef_> => http://pastebin.com/kLTAZiaM
[06:16:13] <mateus73> hi guys ..
[06:16:28] <mateus73> can you have a look here http://wnglinux.co.uk
[06:16:43] <mateus73> sorry: url is http://englinux.co.uk
[06:17:08] <mateus73> if you mouseover on "change language" you get a list of languages
[06:17:23] <mateus73> that's on the fly generated
[06:17:42] <mateus73> I'd like to hide that onBlur
[06:17:47] <mateus73> how can I do that?
[06:17:51] <innociv_> ?eval
[06:17:52] <bot-t> innociv_: Syntax: ? eval <javascript code>
[06:18:23] <mateus73> by the way: jquery 1.7.1
[06:27:17] <kentaromiura> mateus73: you want something like $('.sidebar.ttb-panel.notranslate').mouseout(function(){this.style.display="none"});
[06:28:17] <mateus73> kentaromiura .. but I think I need to use delegate() or on() ?
[06:29:38] <mateus73> kentaromiura .. And I really would like "blur" or "focusout" rather than mouseout
[06:45:55] <kentaromiura> mateus73: sorry i'm new to jquery, so i don't know if focusout can handle it, but blur don't work well with things outside of input, guess the best thing is to add a click handler on body (or any div with trasparent.gif), and hide your popup if e.target != $('.sidebar.ttb-panel.notranslate') or children of that, guess some older jquery user can prove me wrong
[06:49:28] <kentaromiura> or if you want you can track mouseover mouseout on your div and set a flag, then on $('body').click hide your floating div, with some effect
[06:49:33] <mateus73> can i add onblur in line?
[06:55:19] <Sasha_> In case anyone's interested (and uses Python with jQuery)
[06:55:29] <Sasha_> I'm building a serialisation library for SQL databases --> JSON, jQuery, etc
[06:55:37] <Sasha_> Here: https://github.com/sbermeister/SPODS
[06:57:19] <kentaromiura> mateus73: var yourDiv = $('.sidebar.ttb-panel.notranslate'); yourDiv.mouseout(function(){yourDiv.isOut=true;}).mouseover(function(){yourDiv.isOut=false}); $('body').click(function(){yourDiv.isOut && yourDiv.hide()});
[06:57:46] <kentaromiura> something like this.
[06:58:35] <mateus73> ok cool
[07:16:59] <Doobie_> hi everyone
[07:17:04] <Sasha_> hi
[07:17:23] <Doobie_> is there an easy way i can slide transition between two div elements?
[07:17:32] <Sasha_> between?
[07:17:45] <Sasha_> jsfiddle what you mean
[07:17:59] <Doobie_> hiding the first and showing the second, but without them creating a new line when both are visible
[07:18:10] <Sasha_> oh
[07:18:24] <Doobie_> the closest i have gotten is $('#one').hide(); $('#two').show()
[07:18:28] <Sasha_> probably the easiest thing is to fully fade one out and then fade the next one in
[07:18:35] <Sasha_> so
[07:18:48] <Sasha_> $("#one").fadeOut(function() { $("#two").fadeIn() })
[07:18:51] <Doobie_> but it makes the line jump a tiny bit and the transition isnt customizable
[07:19:00] <Doobie_> thats too slow
[07:19:05] <Sasha_> try
[07:19:11] <Doobie_> i want a cross fade, or even better, a slide
[07:19:17] <Sasha_> $("#one").hide(function() { $("#two").show() })
[07:19:26] <Sasha_> ohh i see
[07:19:29] <Sasha_> hmm
[07:19:35] <Sasha_> the only way to do that is to layer them
[07:19:43] <Sasha_> so the one fading in is literally on top of the one fading out
[07:19:48] <Sasha_> like, position: absolute
[07:19:58] <Sasha_> do you know what i mean
[07:20:10] <Sasha_> and then do a fade or a slide or whatever
[07:20:17] <Sasha_> of both, in opposite directions, at once
[07:20:27] <Doobie_> hmm ok, makes sense
[07:20:31] <Doobie_> i will try that
[07:20:33] <kentaromiura> ^ that
[07:20:39] <Sasha_> np
[07:23:21] <Sasha_> Like this
[07:23:28] <Sasha_> http://jsfiddle.net/maqKZ/
[07:33:15] <mateus73> how can I bind an event to an element created on the fly?
[07:33:48] <mateus73> I mean .. I'd like to hide an element created on the fly
[07:33:57] <Doobie_> $(selector).live('click', function() { });
[07:34:18] <Doobie_> assuming that is what you mean by on the fly
[07:34:37] <mateus73> $(selector) is already there
[07:34:58] <mateus73> the function should hide an element created on the fly
[07:35:18] <kentaromiura> probably he means something like var x = createElement
[07:35:33] <mateus73> yes .. I'd like to hide x
[07:37:55] <lost123> a height:0px is set on accordion active portion, what can that be?
[07:38:17] <kentaromiura> $(x).hide()
[07:38:30] <Storm3y> Hi folks, anyone know why .animate doesnt work for changing the height to 100%, but works for changing it to pixels?
[07:39:08] <Storm3y> http://pastebin.ca/2154558 thats the code I got.
[07:39:23] <mateus73> kentaromiura it doesn't work cause the element has not been generated yet
[07:40:16] <kentaromiura> mateus73: after you generate that element, either doing $('<div></div>') or using a document.createElement, you can save the reference
[07:40:19] <Storm3y> The 'morediv works with animation, the #biotext works without animation.
[07:40:55] <mateus73> kentaromiura: ok
[07:41:29] <kentaromiura> just be sure to wrap the element with $ if you want to use jquery method on it
[07:42:33] <lost123> why woud accordion panel have a height:0px sometimes and won;t open ...if i refresh it does open up http://globalpublicvoice.com/
[07:42:52] <lost123> accordion is below slideshow in element .homenews
[07:44:50] <kentaromiura> lost123: i suppose is because image is not loaded
[07:45:48] <kentaromiura> i will set height / minheight on that images
[07:46:51] <lost123> kentaromiura: image is there
[07:47:08] <lost123> you can set height in chorme inspector and see the full image
[07:47:32] <kentaromiura> probably the first time, when image is still loading
[07:47:45] <kentaromiura> you're creating the accordion, but image is still not loaded
[07:48:02] <kentaromiura> once you reload the page, you're loading images from the cache, so it work
[07:49:09] <kentaromiura> when you look with ispector the image is loaded
[07:49:15] <kentaromiura> :)
[07:50:23] <kentaromiura> i will try setting height in css, empty cache and reload, and you should see it working
[07:50:27] <mateus73> is there a way to check if and element is shown or hidden?
[07:50:39] <mateus73> I mean show() and hide()
[07:51:03] <mateus73> like $(selector).is(:visible) maybe?
[07:53:01] <kentaromiura> that should work http://stackoverflow.com/questions/178325/how-do-you-test-if-something-is-hidden-with-jquery
[07:54:06] <kentaromiura> unless you're looking for opacity
[07:54:17] <mateus73> cool
[07:54:57] <lost123> kentaromiura: then what should i do to correct it?
[07:56:57] <kentaromiura> lost123: try adding #homenews a img{height:140px} in your css
[07:57:17] <kentaromiura> and ctrl+F5
[07:57:42] <kentaromiura> to see if the page load correctly
[08:00:09] <kentaromiura> oh well, my first day learning jquery is done, I go to relax myself now
[08:01:07] <zipR4ND> hi all, is it posible, to hold a copy of a dom object in a variable, and do jquery operations on it, and add or remove it to the dom at will?
[08:01:52] <kentaromiura> yep
[08:03:13] <zipR4ND> is it as easy as: var a = '<did>hello</div>'; $('div',a).attr('id','myId'); $('#mainMenu').append(a); ?
[08:04:14] <lost123> thanks a lot kentaromiura
[08:04:21] <lost123> that solved the rpoblem

[08:13:57] <diverdude> If i have set a timer with: window.setInterval(domailautosave, 10000); how do i then cancel it again?
[08:13:57] <zipR4ND> thx kentaromiura :-)
[08:14:41] <nathanstilwell> timer = window.setTimeout(domailautosave, 10000); clearTimeout(timer);
[08:15:15] <diverdude> thx
[08:15:38] <nathanstilwell> No problem. You shouldn't make a habit of using setInterval.
[08:15:55] <nathanstilwell> You should use setTimeout instead.
[08:17:52] <TomWij> diverdude: Read documentation for functions you use, they include this kind of information. (https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout)
[08:26:59] <girlusa> Can someone help me? how can I display the contents of www.google.com on my site? ps: I do not want to use frame.
[08:28:00] <genno_> You can't do it with jQuery. You have to get its contents server side.
[08:28:46] <girlusa> how I do it
[08:28:50] <girlusa> genno_
[08:30:03] <genno_> You have to use a server side language. It depends on what language you want to use and on what you are exactly trying to achieve

[08:33:30] <genno_> kentaromiura, i don't know YQL, but that's a search on google, not the contents of www.google.com
[08:34:10] <kentaromiura> so you want just to echo google.com ?

[09:22:13] <javex0> Hello, quick question: I am changing an input field's value via jQuery("input").val("blabla"); If I do this in Firebug it works perfectly, but executing it from the .js file only changes the value as shown in Firebug but the displayed value is still the old one. Why is this happening and what is the correct way of dealing with it?
[09:26:52] <Raydiation> when do you use .prop and when .attr ? for instance set href of a link
[09:30:44] <javex0> Raydiation: Take a look at this, maybe this helps you: http://jquery-howto.blogspot.de/2011/06/html-difference-between-attribute-and.html Also on the jquery page for .prop() is a good example on checkboxes that might help understanding the working
[09:31:53] <Raydiation> javex0: ty
[09:36:17] <zamba> why is my $('#test').click(console.log("test")); triggered whenever the page is loaded?
[09:36:29] <zamba> but not when i actually click on the link.. ?
[09:36:41] <zamba> <a href="#" id="test">Something</a>
[09:36:42] <zamba> is the html
[09:36:59] <Raydiation> zamba: use an anon func
[09:37:20] <Raydiation> zamba: $('#test').click(function(){console.log("test");});
[09:39:04] <zamba> ok, i did like this instead: function test() { console.log("test");} and then $('#test').click(test());
[09:39:10] <zamba> and the same happened
[09:39:51] <genno_> because you are passing the returned value of test
[09:39:55] <genno_> not the test function
[09:40:00] <javex0> type test
[09:40:02] <javex0> not test()
[09:40:10] <javex0> like it is a variable
[09:40:17] <zamba> ah, ok
[09:40:25] <zamba> but then it doesn't work when i actually click it :)
[09:40:47] <javex0> maybe you overwrote it with a variable?
[09:41:00] <Raydiation> zamba: i always use an anon func, try $('#test').click(function(){ test(); });
[09:41:28] <zamba> Raydiation: but i want to do more than just output "test"
[09:41:40] <zamba> i want to actually program something in there, so it would be nice to have a separate function
[09:41:43] <zamba> but it still doesn't work here
[09:41:49] <zamba> i'll try the anon function
[09:41:51] <zamba> ah
[09:41:58] <zamba> nvm, i saw what you actually wrote now :)
[09:42:04] <Raydiation> np :)
[09:42:41] <zamba> well.. clicking it still doesn't work
[09:42:56] <Raydiation> zamba: paste your code
[09:43:21] <apiii> hi, i'm making a project using a lots of apis, i've heard about webshell.fr (with a jquery sdk).. someone tryed it and is it really usefull ?

[09:43:59] <rohanrhu> i need help
[09:44:01] <zamba> there
[09:44:03] <zamba> got it working
[09:44:05] <zamba> my bad :)
[09:44:29] <rohanrhu> how can i do multiple ajax request?
[09:45:00] <Raydiation> rohanrhu: write them one after another?
[09:45:12] <rohanrhu> is there any event like "other ajax request(s) finished"
[09:45:33] <Raydiation> rohanrhu: you can pass a callback function to call the other requests
[09:45:49] <Raydiation> the callback gets executed once the request is finished
[09:46:10] <rohanrhu> Raydiation: other request is not certain
[09:46:55] <Raydiation> rohanrhu: well , just modify your callback function to tell you what has finished
[09:46:58] <rohanrhu> Raydiation: other request(s) may or not may
[09:47:24] <Raydiation> for instance i need 4 callbacks to arrive so my callback function increments a member variable
[09:49:25] <Raydiation> rohanrhu: write them sequentially if you want them to do more than one at the same time
[09:49:28] <ragnok>  i want to make a background slideshow fullscreen for a css design. i think might be best to use jquery instead of css3 animation. any ideas where to start? i found this http://buildinternet.com/2009/02/supersized-full-screen-backgroundslideshow-jquery-plugin/  but im not sure if its a good fit
[09:49:52] <rohanrhu> ragnok: methinks problem is differrent
[09:50:20] <rohanrhu> Raydiation: http://88.235.221.185/rcms/naroui
[09:50:38] <rohanrhu> look classes at alert
[09:52:06] <ragnok> i forgot to mention that the slide wwill cycle svg files and must be responsive/fuid
[09:53:55] <rohanrhu> Raydiation: can you help me
[09:54:17] <Raydiation> rohanrhu: well you need to tell me your exact problem
[09:54:36] <Raydiation> plus i dont know your lib
[09:57:06] <prefixed> ok, how do I do a check for "[]"?
[09:57:33] <Raydiation> prefixed: where
[09:57:58] <prefixed> in this context:
[09:57:59] <prefixed> $(this).closest('.views-row').next().find('.jplayer')
[09:58:00] <Raydiation> you mean if (object["property"] === undefined)
[09:58:26] <apiii> .length
[09:58:35] <prefixed> apiii good call
[09:58:59] <apiii> :)
[09:59:03] <prefixed> I don't understand why [] != empty or null though
[09:59:09] <prefixed> or NaN
[10:00:27] <aca20031> because, javascript is (rather, tries to be) strongly typed...and an empty array simply isnt the same thing as a null reference
[10:02:41] <apiii> nobody tryed http://webshell.fr/ to say me if it's rly usefull ? or if i should implement all APIs one by one myself ?
[10:06:49] <Raydiation> webshell looks like some coffeescript + libs
[10:07:54] <apiii> full oriented api
[10:14:34] <gadlol> hi to all fans of jQuery. I have a question: if we I want to remove a class should i first check to see if it exists and then remove if or just call the removeClass? Which is safer method and faster?
[10:15:28] <gadlol> f.e.: if($elem.hasClass('bla') ) $elem.removeClass('bla'); or just $elem.removeClass('bla'); ?
[10:15:56] <apiii> just $elem.removeClass('bla'); works ;)
[10:17:57] <apiii> if $elem doesn't have the "bla" class, it will do nothing
[10:18:29] <gadlol> xmm so i ll without hasClass

[10:29:38] <rohanrhu> variables in this function, if i define it with use var, is these become global?
[10:29:41] <Raydiation> rohanrhu: well, just use var then you can be sure that its not global
[10:29:53] <rohanrhu> global for inner functions
[10:30:06] <Raydiation> yes
[10:30:22] <Raydiation> thats how you emulate private usually
[10:30:24] <xenaxon> can anyone help me please?
[10:30:35] <rohanrhu> is these become global for functions at (function ($) ... ?
[10:31:37] <Raydiation> rohanrhu: depends on your scope, var goes inwards, but not outwards

[10:32:19] <rohanrhu> Raydiation: i understand thank you
[11:24:37] <wb__> I am evaluating Using jquery UI or rolling my own using jquery. The thing that is irking me about jquery UI is how element classes are presentational and not semantic. Is this ok or not ok?
[11:26:38] <wb__> can anyone make a case against using jquery UI
[11:30:56] <Dolemike> wb_: what do you mean by "element classes are presentational and not semantic."
[11:35:10] <opie-x> wb__: against using it? Yeah it doesn't have out of the box support for whatever server technology you're using, most likely
[11:36:40] <ajpiano> wb__: just like pretty much everything ever, some of the classes are semantic and others are presentational
[11:36:59] <ajpiano> if you want to write an entire ui library from scratch because of that, have a good time :p
[11:37:16] <wb__> haha, yeah. maybe I will
[11:37:18] <ajpiano> opie-x: not sure what you mean, jquery ui is a client side ui framework, it doesn't have "out of the box support" for any server technology
[11:37:29] <wb__> yeah, I didn't understand that either
[11:37:42] <opie-x> what server technology do you use?
[11:37:55] <ajpiano> waiters and waitresses
[11:37:59] <ajpiano> BAM
[11:38:07] <smplstk> haha
[11:38:35] <wb__> I am pretty new to front end development, and I guess I am wondering what scenario would cause me to regret using jquery UI further down the road?
[11:38:46] <opie-x> you don't understand
[11:38:56] <opie-x> well, packages like telerik and wijimo and dhxtml
[11:39:13] <opie-x> all have server support, to make rendering objects easier using php, ror, and .net
[11:39:21] <smplstk> opie-x: .NET ewwww, I mean <3 MicroSloft
[11:39:28] <opie-x> whatever, he asked
[11:39:44] <opie-x> if he's new
[11:39:47] <ajpiano> wb__: there are a lot of edge-casey bugs in the interactions right now - draggable droppable sortable etc, which can be frustrating if you have an intricate thing you want to implement
[11:40:19] <ajpiano> but mostly the same things that would make you regret using jquery ui are the same things you could potentially regret with any ui framework
[11:40:41] <opie-x> i tell ya i've looked at a lot, and jquery ui, specially 1.9 is really really easy to read
[11:40:48] <smplstk> you need to research the UI framework and determine what _your_ needs are, etc etc etc.
[11:40:48] <ajpiano> which mostly boils down to how the code that implements the framework is architected
[11:41:02] <ajpiano> and i don't mean *their* code, but your own
[11:41:29] <ajpiano> like, if you have lots of custom callbacks for different uses of the UI widgets, but then all of them are just anonymous functions and there's no structure to your app
[11:41:32] <ajpiano> ... maintenance hell
[11:42:23] <smplstk> that sounds like fun to me!
[11:42:56] <wb__> gotchya, thanks ajpiano
[11:47:12] <smplstk> wb__: If you're already using jQuery, jQuery UI is a great addition if you need simple widgets that are easy to use.
[11:47:38] <smplstk> and jQuery UI is quite prevalent in the wild, grooveshark as an example.
[11:47:52] <xenaxon> hi how can I arrange photos in a grid layout
[11:47:56] <xenaxon> and make them re-arrange when browser width changes
[11:48:05] <wb__> smplstk Is it difficult to custmoize look and feel? I mean i guess you just have to override all of jquerys classes? not to difficult right?
[11:48:07] <xenaxon> ?
[11:48:22] <wb__> giving a custom look and feel is important to me
[11:49:10] <ajpiano> it can be tricky but i wouldn't say it's "difficult" - we are working on improving the tools to separate the structural css from the pure styling css
[11:49:20] <ajpiano> you end up having to just override a lot of styles
[11:49:28] <ajpiano> which is best done in an *external* stylesheet
[11:49:33] <ajpiano> that overrides the jqueryui styles
[11:49:43] <ajpiano> instead of modifying the supplied stylesheet
[11:49:47] <smplstk> wb__: ya - it's just a matter of working with the styles "properly".
[11:50:32] <smplstk> what ajpiano said :)
[11:50:56] <wb__> I see, code definitely seems to be married to jquery UI once you start using it though
[11:50:59] <smplstk> it's easy to work with the existing style sheets and add a an additional layer to them.
[11:51:02] <wb__> as with any UI framework of course
[11:51:14] <smplstk> ya
[11:51:25] <smplstk> it just depends how crazy you want to get with your functionality
[11:51:37] <smplstk> avoid callback soup etc etc.
[11:52:12] <smplstk> but as far as dealing with simple "look and feel", jQuery UI is quite baller imo.
[11:52:17] <wb__> Is there some reading on patterns you guys might reccomend?
[11:52:29] <Husel> Hello, I have a page with many entries and I'm trying to use jQuery to show and hide the edit box for just one entry when it's button is clicked. I have it where all of them show and hide, and I've had it where whichever button is pressed, only the top shows and hides. How do I get the proper behaviour?
[11:53:03] <smplstk> I'll let ajpiano chime in on that one if anything comes into his mind.
[11:57:55] <Dolemike> xenanon: I am trying to put together a fiddle, one sec new to this

[12:30:19] <specijalac> shoky: you mean a mobile app built with jquery or?
[12:41:15] <aJacom> Hi. I'm having a problem. jQuery(document).ready is in the middle of the page, and jQuery is loaded in the footer. I'm getting "Undefined function" error. Should I delete "jQuery(document).ready" or include jQuery in the header?
[12:43:42] <ajpiano> aJacom: you should include the script *after* you include jQuery
[12:43:48] <ajpiano> both of those would ideally be at the bottom of the body
[13:01:23] <shoky> specijalac: i mean a native iphone app ;p

[13:24:32] <savid> I'm not able to do $(myArray).map(mapfunc).join('.')
[13:31:22] <savid> oh, apparently I needed to do $.map(myArray, mapfunc).join('.')
[13:36:07] <raj> how come from browser to server, type isn't preserved, but it is from server to browser? for example, when sending integers in an object (associative array)
[13:37:58] <Dr-Bombay> javascript doesn't have integers
[13:38:10] <raj> what does it have?
[13:39:15] <Dr-Bombay> numbers
[13:40:40] <raj> ok, sure
[13:40:54] <raj> but anyway, when i do an ajax post to my server, everything is a string
[13:41:00] <raj> there are no types
[13:41:38] <Dr-Bombay> wouldn't know about that
[13:58:11] <savid> I'm wrapping my js code in (function($){ ... })(jQuery);.   But, I'm getting "undefined is not a function" when I do that.  If I put a console.log(jQuery);  right above that, the error goes away.  What gives?
[14:03:36] <systemfault> savid: It looks fine to me.. could you give us the URL with that error?
[14:04:31] <savid> I'm developing locally, nothign deployed right now.  Can't seem to reproduce it in jsfiddle either.  I'm going to just change some things around and see what happens.
[14:04:44] <systemfault> :/
[14:05:02] <savid> strange.  Even when putting just "jQuery;" in the line above that, the error doesn't occur.
[15:23:28] <bobbytek2> is there a more terse way of expressing the following? $table.removeClass('profits').addClass('losses');
[15:23:41] <bobbytek2> that is independent of current state?
[15:41:35] <smopp> Can one customize HTTP header values for an ajax request?
[15:43:28] <shoky> smopp: yeah you can use the 'headers' setting
[15:45:43] <smopp> shoky, so you could spoof the referrers too?
[15:45:53] <shoky> donno
[15:46:22] <shoky> you can also add a 'beforeSend' callback and have direct access to the xhr object there
[16:09:37] <smopp> i'm trying to think how i could spoof the referrer for all my external resources on the page.  i guess i could try hijacking the loading of all scripts, styles, links, imgs, frames, etc. and then turning them into ajax requests with spoofed ref headers, then b64-/data uri- encode them and change the src's/href's on them to the data: uris, right?
[16:13:11] <xarg> Maybe if not for same origin policy
[16:16:14] <smopp> What am i doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/gVcsQ/
[16:16:23] <min|dvir|us> Hi. How do I do something when the user does anything at all (move the mouse, click, focus on an element)?
[16:17:23] <min|dvir|us> Is it possible to detect when a print dialog closes?
[16:18:02] <smopp> min|dvir|us, i'd imagine it would depend how the print dialog was opened.
[16:18:34] <shoky> smopp: there's no
[16:18:37] <shoky> JSON.encode
[16:18:41] <shoky> it's JSON.stringify
[16:18:56] <smopp> shoky, there's no... what?
[16:19:05] <shoky> smopp: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/gVcsQ/1/
[16:19:21] <shoky> there's no JSON.encode..
[16:20:59] <desophos> hey all
[16:21:05] <desophos> I have a question
[16:21:09] <desophos> as you might have guessed
[16:21:22] <smopp> min|dvir|us, i would just have a function doSomething() and then set it as a trigger for all the events you mention...
[16:21:22] <tw2113> we don't allow questions
[16:21:24] <tw2113> just statements
[16:21:36] <shoky> anecdotes work too
[16:22:20] <desophos> ("there is a way to force jQuery to reapply CSS" || false)
[16:22:26] <smopp> tw2113, :)
[16:22:32] <smopp> desophos, hahaha
[16:23:57] <desophos> the problem I'm having is: I'm loading footer HTML from an external file, but jQuery isn't applying CSS to it.
[16:24:07] <smopp> min|dvir|us, there's a $("*") selector... $("*").focus(function(){doSomething();};
[16:24:21] <shoky> desophos: why would jquery apply any css to it?
[16:24:24] <smopp> oops... $("*").focus(function(){doSomething();});
[16:24:30] <desophos> because it contains buttons
[16:24:49] <shoky> and?
[16:25:48] <desophos> and... it doesn't have any CSS
[16:25:56] <shoky> and it should, because... ?
[16:26:20] <desophos> because it contains <a data-role="button">s
[16:26:25] <tw2113> i think desophos has stuff being added after the css painting
[16:26:31] <desophos> that's what I think
[16:26:45] <desophos> but I have no idea how to fix that
[16:27:10] <shoky> and your css has a selector for those buttons, applying some css to it ?
[16:27:36] <desophos> yes
[16:27:44] <shoky> ok you might've mentioned that
[16:27:49] <shoky> how is this related to jquery though?
[16:28:00] <tw2113> jquery is being used to add it to the page
[16:28:08] <shoky> jquery doesn't apply css
[16:28:09] <desophos> I'm using jquery mobile
[16:28:15] <shoky> well then
[16:28:17] <tw2113> and thus his problem :P
[16:28:20] <shoky> why did you ask about jquery
[16:28:27] <min|dvir|us> smopp: I can select all elements.
[16:28:33] <min|dvir|us> But I want to also fire on all events.
[16:28:37] <min|dvir|us> (That are user-generated.)
[16:28:46] <desophos> I'm using the jquery mobile CSS
[16:28:54] <smopp> min|dvir|us, sorry i have to go.
[16:29:07] <min|dvir|us> I want to fire on all user-generated events. Anyone have any ideas?
[16:30:19] <desophos> it works fine when I don't load the HTML from an external source
[16:30:39] <desophos> but when I do, the HTML has no CSS applied to it
[16:30:48] <desophos> because of what tw2113 said
[16:30:58] <desophos> it's loading the HTML after the CSS painting
[16:31:14] <shoky> i blame tw2113 also.
[16:31:18] <desophos> haha
[16:31:31] <min|dvir|us> I want to fire on all user-generated events. Anyone have any ideas?
[16:31:44] <shoky> min|dvir|us: i dont think jquery has any way to do that..
[16:31:58] <min|dvir|us> shoky: sure it does.
[16:32:05] <shoky> o.o
[16:32:06] <tw2113> i do too shoky and desophos
[16:32:09] <min|dvir|us> At the very worst I can manually specify user-generated events.
[16:32:33] <shoky> what?
[16:32:40] <tw2113> blame tw2113
[16:32:45] <shoky> and what if i add another user-generated event that you didnt manually specify..
[16:32:48] <shoky> ;)
[16:33:04] <min|dvir|us> shoky: you being Mozilla?
[16:33:13] <shoky> whut?
[16:33:25] <shoky> me being the user
[16:33:31] <shoky> generating the event
[16:33:34] <specijalac> why does my:$(window).keyup() - work on every browser, except IE's: 7 & 8
[16:33:34] <specijalac> <specijalac> ?
[16:33:53] <min|dvir|us> shoky: me being the programmer would include all user-generated events.
[16:34:04] <shoky> min|dvir|us: yes, how?
[16:34:36] <min|dvir|us> shoky: $('*').on('click mouseup mousedown keypress keyup keydown mousemove mouseon blah blah', eventHandler);
[16:34:47] <shoky> $('body').trigger('LOL')
[16:34:59] <min|dvir|us> shoky: that's not a user-generated event.
[16:35:00] <shoky> you didnt catch me
[16:35:04] <shoky> it isn't?
[16:35:14] <min|dvir|us> No. That would be a program-generated event.
[16:35:52] <shoky> ok.. so you have your solution?
[16:36:01] <min|dvir|us> I have a solution.
[16:36:03] <min|dvir|us> I want a better one.
[16:36:17] <desophos> isn't that always the case?
[16:36:29] <min|dvir|us> desophos: sometimes I am satisfied with the solution but not in this case.
[16:36:34] <shoky> min|dvir|us: you (or someone..) would need to register an event listener for each type of event
[16:37:25] <shoky> min|dvir|us: and like i said, i dont think jquery has any way for you to specify ALL events without specifying each one
[16:37:46] <shoky> maybe there's a native DOM way to do it
[16:38:36] <shoky> why you would want to listen to ALL events blindly is beyond me tho
[16:38:53] <forlamp> hi
[16:40:19] <desophos> so, any hints for my problem? I think it's fairly serious and I have no idea how to proceed
[16:40:30] <forlamp> what is your problem?
[16:41:06] <desophos> I'm inserting HTML into my page from an external source after CSS is applied to the page.
[16:41:34] <shoky> desophos: you probably need to use some 'refresh' method/option
[16:41:43] <shoky> on the buttons
[16:41:52] <desophos> that's one possibility I was thinking of, but I don't know how to do that
[16:41:55] <shoky> i donno jq mobile too much tho
[16:42:12] <forlamp> oh jq mobile; out of my area of expertise good luck lol
[16:43:04] <desophos> wow, the keyword 'refresh' was all I needed
[16:43:12] <desophos> apparently that exists now
[16:43:22] <desophos> thanks :)
[16:43:25] <shoky> ;P
[16:43:43] <specijalac> guys
[16:43:50] <specijalac> no trolling around here
[16:44:03] <specijalac> but I'm really expirencing some crazy things last das
[16:44:04] <specijalac> days
[16:44:17] <specijalac> because of lack of social life and human interaction/communication
[16:44:19] <specijalac> this morning
[16:44:26] <specijalac> before I woke up
[16:44:41] <specijalac> I've saw these things in a form of a dream
[16:44:48] <forlamp> $('specijalac').hide();
[16:44:51] <specijalac> $('myself').wakeup();
[16:45:02] <specijalac> $('myself').coffee();
[16:45:13] <specijalac> is this normal behavior before awakening?
[16:45:21] <shoky> that's common.. when you're doing something for a long time, repetitively
[16:45:27] <forlamp> wouldnt it be $(this) if referring to yourself? :P
[16:45:39] <specijalac> it wasn't this!
[16:45:48] <specijalac> it was singlequotet 'mysql'
[16:45:56] <specijalac> myself*
[16:46:01] <shoky> even if i just play a mundane tetris-like game
[16:46:08] <shoky> for an hour or two before i sleep
[16:46:22] <shoky> then the world is tetrisy.
[16:46:47] <specijalac> man...
[16:46:55] <specijalac> when I get a girlfriend
[16:46:57] <shoky> and if i feel comfy in bed its cause i managed to get that block in just right
[16:47:02] <specijalac> then I'll have to dream of her every night!
[16:47:36] <shoky> O_K_
[16:48:52] <macfan> when i get a girlfriend im gonna teach her jquery
[16:48:58] <macfan> and then she will leave me
[16:48:59] <shoky> i'm more intrigued by your typo of 'mysql' for 'myself'
[16:49:21] <zamba> i don't have an id on my form, but how can i select it?
[16:49:27] <zamba> $('form') didn't work
[16:49:37] <shoky> that would depend on your DOM structure
[16:49:43] <shoky> and where the form is
[16:49:46] <shoky> in the DOM.
[16:49:51] <zamba> it's at the beginning
[16:49:56] <shoky> LoL.
[16:50:07] <shoky> $('form') will get all forms
[16:50:12] <zamba> there's only one form
[16:50:16] <shoky> then it will get that form
[16:50:18] <macfan> <form>
[16:50:29] <macfan> <doctype html>
[16:50:39] <shoky> r0ng
[16:50:57] <zamba> hm, i'm trying to reset the form.. i guess the reset() method is what's not working here
[16:51:02] <zamba> $('form').reset();
[16:51:05] <zamba> that's the code
[16:51:21] <shoky> jquery doesn't have a reset method
[16:51:32] <desophos> ugh, apparently jquery mobile doesn't have a refresh option for buttons
[16:51:32] <shoky> i guess you want $('form')[0].reset(0
[16:51:37] <shoky>  $('form')[0].reset()
[16:52:10] <zamba> shoky: ah, thanks
[16:53:05] <macfan> what does the [0] do
[16:53:25] <shoky> gets the first DOM element in that jq collection
[16:53:39] <macfan> oh nice, so like an index
[16:53:48] <shoky> exactly like an index
[16:53:58] <shoky> jq collection are pseudo-arrays
[16:54:03] <desophos> any jquery mobile experts on here?
[16:54:23] <shoky> desophos don't ask that. ask your question once an hour or so and you'll get help eventually
[16:54:36] <desophos> alright
[16:55:11] <shoky> in about 30 min i can try to help too. bbl
[16:57:45] <desophos> alright, thanks
[17:04:19] <forlamp> deso have you done much googling about it?
[17:04:55] <desophos> I'm trying
[17:07:07] <Iarfen> Hi!!!
[17:08:01] <Iarfen> I need to attach an onload event to an img element, how I do it?? I have the following code: http://pastebin.com/wM62Ag3e
[17:08:09] <Iarfen> I receive an error message, what I have to do??
[17:09:24] <systemfault> wtf..
[17:09:47] <systemfault> Iarfen: The second parameter to .bind is a function, not a string
[17:10:12] <Iarfen> systemfault: I can't give it a string to execute a function??
[17:10:29] <systemfault> Nah, only bad APIs do that.
[17:11:12] * systemfault is looking at setTimeout/setInterval with evil eyes.
[17:12:00] <systemfault> .bind('load', function() { adminThemeController_sections_deleteTmpIcon(foo, bar); }).attr…..
[17:12:18] <systemfault> Also.. that function name… his creator deserve a medal.
[17:12:31] <forlamp> hah
[17:13:30] <Iarfen> systemfault: what's the problem with the function name??
[17:14:11] <systemfault> Iarfen: Stupidly long? A mix of camel case and underscores?
[17:14:48] <Iarfen> systemfault: It's for clasify good t he function... I have a lot of functions!! Really a lot
[17:15:09] <systemfault> Iarfen: You create groups by using an object
[17:16:04] <systemfault> Iarfen: var adminThemeController = {}; adminThemeController.sections = {}; adminThemeController.sections.deleteTmpIcon = function() { alert('lol'); };
[17:16:16] <systemfault> Something like that..
[17:16:19] <systemfault> Anyway :)
[17:17:04] <Iarfen> systemfault: So I program all things with objects?? I will think that, ty!!! Really ty!! :D
[17:17:14] <Iarfen> systemfault: Where I can learn more "tricks" like these??
[17:17:31] <systemfault> Iarfen: You can use objects like namespaces in other languages
[17:17:33] <systemfault> Hmm..
[17:18:06] <systemfault> "Javascript: The good parts" is a good book, there's also the free but good "Eloquent Javascript"
[17:18:21] <systemfault> Or of course, you could google for javascript patterns
[17:32:41] <rohanrhu> systemfault: hi i need help
[17:33:02] <systemfault> Y ME?
[17:33:22] <systemfault> Better ask the channel :)
[17:34:03] <rohanrhu> http://88.235.221.185/rcms/naroui
[17:34:38] <shoky> desophos: have you tried calling .trigger('create') on your buttons?
[17:35:19] <systemfault> rohanrhu: What's wrong?
[17:35:20] <rohanrhu> systemfault: in $.get(, function() {
[17:36:03] <shoky> desophos: or maybe on their container element
[17:36:10] <rohanrhu> in get()'s finished function grid_div looks same in differrent calls
[17:36:30] <rohanrhu> but each grid_divs is differrent divs
[17:37:12] <rohanrhu> #urunler and #urunler2 these are divs and im calling $('#urunler').naroGrid() and $('#urunler2').naroGrid()
[17:37:20] <rohanrhu> but in $.get
[17:39:03] <rohanrhu> in $.get()'s finished function grid_div looks same, im alerting grid_div variable in $.get()'s finished function but alert print #urunler2 twice
[17:40:48] <rohanrhu> systemfault: i can tell?
[17:42:27] <desophos> it actually turns out that the css is fine in the browser
[17:42:36] <rohanrhu> shoky: can you help me
[17:42:39] <desophos> so now I'm trying to emulate it on android
[17:42:47] <desophos> but I am having trouble :P
[17:44:23] <shoky> desophos: .trigger('create') on the parent element works for me
[17:45:29] <desophos> it didn't do anything, but I think it's just a problem with Dreamweaver, since it works in the browser
[17:45:32] <shoky> rohanrhu: you'll have to do a better job of explaining your problem and giving a demo..
[17:46:01] <rohanrhu> shoky: http://88.235.221.185/rcms/naroui
[17:46:13] <shoky> rohanrhu: yes i see that, i have no idea what that page is doing

[19:01:32] <ep0ch> after about 50 failed websites created I've finally built a site that has potential...and I'm looking to integrate some type of forum with it, a very simple forum, not any sort of bloated CMS like phpBB or the like...I'd also like it to be riddled with the jQuery prettifulness, does anyone know of some sort of easily customizable simple forum that would fit my needs? My site is pointstackers.com and there's just enough room in the n
[19:02:41] <ep0ch> receiving numerous requests from users to incorporate a forum so I figured I'd ask here since you guys are the ones in the extreme 'know' about this sort of thing
[19:04:11] <rocLv> hi, guys
[19:08:31] <yanick_> hi, is the current jQuery UI Menu widget compatible with jQuery UI 1.8, or do I have to download the 1.9 version? Also, if I have to download the 1.9 version, is there any way I can have an already compiled, minified source?
[19:12:50] <specijalac> any good jQuery image croppers, similar those once available on facebook?
[19:21:04] <ep0ch> perhaps the gurus are engaged in rapid eye movement
[19:21:12] <ep0ch> i shall return later
[19:23:52] <desophos> shoky: I've finally got the app running in my Android emulator. I'm having the same problem as before, i.e. no CSS in the footer on the first page loaded, and .trigger('create') does nothing. The CSS shows up fine in Firefox, but for some reason it doesn't work in Dreamweaver or on Android.
[19:24:13] <desophos> Where should I put my .trigger('create')? That probably makes a difference.
[19:24:18] <Ziber> So, I have a series of checkboxes and when each one is clicked, I write out a confirm message at the bottom of the page. On unclick, I want the output message to list the ones that are still checked. How can I loop through the ones that are still checked?
[19:24:21] <desophos> I tried putting it everywhere, but no luck.
[19:26:46] <desophos> Ziber, http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[19:28:03] <desophos> does that help, Ziber?
[19:29:30] <Ziber> One sec, lets see.
[19:34:40] <Ziber> I know if a specific one is checked, what I don't know how to do is loop through them all to see if its checked.
[19:34:44] <Ziber> How can I loop through elements?
[19:34:54] <specijalac> witch elements?
[19:35:32] <Ziber> they're checkboxes, and I want to check each one, individually, if it is checked or not and echo an output list of all of them that are.
[19:35:36] <tw2113> which* specijalac
[19:35:49] <specijalac> :D thanks tw2113
[19:36:01] <Ziber> I can append to this list when one is checked, but if one is unchecked, i want the list to only remove the unchecked one.
[19:36:28] <tw2113> Ziber you'll want to figure out how to select input[type="checkbox"]
[19:36:37] <tw2113> maybe with each()
[19:36:39] <tw2113> ?each
[19:36:39] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[19:36:41] <specijalac> $('input:checkbox').is(':checked');
[19:36:50] <specijalac> or .not(':checked');
[19:38:31] <Ziber> Ah, thank you.
[19:41:29] <specijalac> i tebi jarane ;)
[19:45:15] <Ziber> This isn't quite working, maybe I'm missing something. http://sandbox.liber.in/cr/network.php
[19:46:18] <Ziber> If you click "List Networks", you'll see the checkboxes I'm talking about.
[19:47:05] <specijalac> $("#delStatus").html("");
[19:47:08] <specijalac> that ain't right
[19:47:16] <Ziber> If you check one, a status bit comes up at the bottom. If you click both of them, it'll add the other one. If you uncheck one of them, the list clears itself. I want to leave the one that is checked.
[19:47:27] <specijalac> want my help?
[19:47:46] <Ziber> Yes, please.
[19:47:58] <specijalac> so do it like this
[19:48:16] <specijalac> (please be patient because I'm writting code in my head and executing it right there as well!)
[19:48:26] <shoky> Ziber: $("#networkList").each
[19:48:38] <shoky> you are doing .each on only one element /

[19:48:52] <specijalac> shoky, this is my task!
[19:48:55] <specijalac> let me finish it !
[19:49:08] <shoky> specijalac: i dont trust you to
[19:49:32] <shoky> Ziber: i think you meant $(".delNetwork").each( ...
[19:50:08] <Ziber> oooh
[19:50:40] <Ziber> thanks! :D
[19:50:44] <shoky> ;P
[19:56:17] <rohanrhu> in jquery plugin how to define variables for each jquery object($('.a_div').myFunction() like for each $('.a_div'))
[19:56:26] <rohanrhu> shoky: is my problem very insane? :D
[19:56:52] <shoky> not sure what you meant
[19:57:17] <shoky> you say define variables for jquery objects... then you say .myFunction()
[19:57:25] <shoky> and other weird stuff
[19:59:09] <rohanrhu> shoky: for each $('.a_div').myFunction()
[19:59:35] <shoky> rohanrhu: my sister banana a dolphin
[19:59:52] <rohanrhu> variables must become of that calling
[19:59:58] <shoky> LOL
[20:00:58] <rohanrhu> shoky: if you are available, do you help me?
[20:01:16] <shoky> if you ask a question i can understand, definitely
[20:01:32] <shoky> right now my guess is you're looking maybe for $.fn
[20:01:39] <shoky> like:  $.fn.myFunction = function() { ........... }
[20:01:46] <JoeyA> What does jQuery.data(elem, 'foo') do if 'foo' has never been attached to the element?  Is it guaranteed to return undefined?
[20:02:00] <JoeyA> The documentation doesn't seem to say.
[20:02:11] <shoky> tias?
[20:02:12] <rohanrhu> shoky: im writing a jquery plugin
[20:02:20] <JoeyA> I already did try it.
[20:03:06] <rohanrhu> shoky: it calls like $('.some_class').myFunction()
[20:03:12] <shoky> JoeyA: the docs say:   If nothing was set on that element, an empty string is returned.
[20:03:43] <shoky> rohanrhu: ok
[20:03:44] <rohanrhu> and for each call, variables must be local for that calling
[20:04:07] <shoky> rohanrhu: maybe you want to store data on the elements with .data()
[20:04:21] <macfan> opera 12 x64 is blazing fast
[20:04:35] <rohanrhu> shoky: my english is not enough sorry but i do my best
[20:05:23] <shoky> JoeyA: sry. it returns undefined as you can see..
[20:05:53] <rohanrhu> shoky: yes $.data() i have read it but it way is as weird
[20:06:00] <rohanrhu> is .data() true way?
[20:06:10] <JoeyA> shoky: Hmm..., the documentation appears to be incorrect.
[20:06:45] <JoeyA> When I run alert(jQuery.data( document.body, 'foo' )); and alert(jQuery.data( document.body )); , I get undefined and [object Object], respectively.
[20:06:52] <rohanrhu> shoky: http://88.235.221.185/rcms/naroui/js/naroui.grid.js
[20:07:49] <rohanrhu> shoky: e.g. current_page variable, do i must define it with .data()?
[20:08:21] <shoky> JoeyA: yeah i guess that line in the docs is off
[20:08:21] <species> rohanrhu: sounds interesting, whats it about?
[20:08:42] <shoky> rohanrhu: that depends how you're gonna use it...
[20:09:23] <shoky> rohanrhu: if it doesn't have to do with a specific element, but with your plugin as a whole, then it needs to stay the way you did it..
[20:11:13] <JoeyA> shoky: Thanks
[20:11:36] <JoeyA> I'll just check typeof result === "function", and hope $.data never returns "an empty function" in the future ;-)
[20:11:41] <shoky> rohanrhu: i see you have 'self = this'
[20:11:44] <JoeyA> (since the thing I'm getting is a function)
[20:11:50] <shoky> rohanrhu: better change that ASAP to 'var self = this'
[20:12:33] <shoky> JoeyA: you can just check if its undefined..
[20:13:11] <rohanrhu> shoky: i tried it ok but my english is not enough, do i must use .data() or not?
[20:13:29] <shoky> rohanrhu:  IT DEPENDS
[20:14:01] <shoky> rohanrhu: sometimes you need to use it, other times you dont have to..
[20:14:18] <shoky> rohanrhu: i dont know what your plugin is doing or how you're using it, so i dont really know what you need
[20:15:03] <shoky> rohanrhu: but i've given you some info to help with it... not my fault you don't know english :\

[20:24:33] * shoky spits on specijalac
[20:24:38] <raj> i just got John Carter and Safe House actually, forgot about that
[20:24:45] <shoky> that sounds like utter rubbish, specijalac
[20:24:52] <specijalac> :D
[20:24:53] <shoky> i watched john carter
[20:25:04] <specijalac> sure it does
[20:25:16] <shoky> it starts out kinda nice. but then it gets kinda lame (imo)
[20:25:18] <specijalac> rubbish was the help boat in 2010 with sayeret matkal :D
[20:25:51] <shoky> go live in the pop-news why dontcha
[20:27:50] <rocLv> hi, guys.  does Jquery UI's datepicker  have to bind with <input>?
[20:28:03] <raj> ok, then safe house it is
[20:28:14] <raj> i guess while i'm here, i might as well ask a jq question :)
[20:28:18] <shoky> ;p
[20:28:21] <rocLv> when I use $('.selcetor').datepicker("show")
[20:28:22] <raj> how can I do what the comments say? http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/CUyUD/7/
[20:28:46] <rocLv> it does'nt work
[20:28:55] <shoky> raj: whacha mean, animate height?
[20:29:07] <raj> yeah
[20:29:22] <rocLv> it doesn't work
[20:29:58] <shoky> raj: whats the prob?  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/CUyUD/8/
[20:29:58] <rocLv> when I bind datepicker with a link
[20:30:23] <raj> hmm
[20:30:40] <raj> doesn't work
[20:30:46] <shoky> wat
[20:30:58] <raj> oh, it just did
[20:31:03] <raj> that was weird, it didn't do it at first
[20:31:51] <shoky> raj: cause you mouseovered on the bars themselves and not on the container div
[20:32:01] <shoky> that wont trigger ti
[20:32:08] <raj> oh
[20:32:29] <raj> so how come height doesn't need pixels?
[20:32:38] <raj> and i don't have to specify `css` or anything
[20:32:39] <shoky> it's pixels by default
[20:32:48] <shoky> 'css'?
[20:32:57] <shoky> whacha mean
[20:33:09] <shoky> ?animate @ raj
[20:33:12] <shoky> :p
[20:33:14] <raj> like .css('height', '18px')
[20:33:30] <shoky> cause thats how you change the css property
[20:33:36] <shoky> and .animate(...) is how you animate it
[20:33:44] <raj> yeah, admittedly I skimmed over it and didn't understand it fast enough so I asked here
[20:34:08] <raj> so animate always works on css then?
[20:34:16] <raj> like, i can put any css property in there
[20:34:28] <shoky> mmm most, not all i think
[20:34:30] <raj> jesus, it's the first line
[20:34:33] <raj> sorry
[20:34:40] <raj> that was just piss poor of a question
[20:34:48] <shoky> :P
[20:36:33] <shoky> raj they better have a good ep this week :@@@@@
[20:36:37] <shoky> or ill murder em
[20:36:47] <shoky> coz thats the only currently running show that im watching
[20:36:55] <shoky> everything else is such crap :\
[20:37:04] <raj> yeah
[20:37:09] <raj> you should watch Suits
[20:37:12] <raj> it's about to start again
[20:37:52] <shoky> hmm maybe i'll try.. the premise doesnt interest me much
[20:38:04] <shoky> the name is a real turnoff for me ;)
[20:39:39] <raj> haha
[20:39:41] <raj> agreed
[20:39:52] <raj> but my brother is a lawyer and he convinced me it's the only good lawyer show on tv
[20:39:55] <raj> so I watched it
[20:40:00] <raj> and it's pretty good
[20:40:10] <shoky> heh oks i'll try
[20:40:16] <raj> first 3 episodes rule
[20:40:25] <raj> you must watch the first 3 episodes before deciding
[20:40:48] <shoky> ;p enough that i am aware of the rule. i dont really have to abide by it :)
[20:40:58] <shoky> i am not a man of principles
[20:41:46] <javalover> hi guys i'm slightly confused on syntax at the moment
[20:42:05] <javalover> I'm creating a function that I want attached to everything that contains this class lets call it myclass
[20:42:31] <raj> haha
[20:42:51] <javalover> so in jquery i'm going $(".myclass").scroll(function(){ //do stuff}
[20:43:03] <javalover> what I want is just to reference that particular myclass...do I use this?
[20:43:24] <javalover> like if i say inside there    function(){ this.find("#mydiv"); }  is that proper?
[20:43:31] <javalover> or how do I just gain access to the current thing being scrolled?
[20:43:58] <javalover> and reading over that my question is confusing so imma rephrase it
[20:44:04] <shoky> javalover: 'this' is correct
[20:44:08] <shoky> but
[20:44:21] <javalover> i'm glad you can understand me shoky :-)
[20:44:30] <shoky> it will reference the DOM element. you'll wanna wrap it:  $(this).find(...)....
[20:44:44] <javalover> ohhh
[20:44:48] <javalover> ok cool cool
[20:45:01] * greggies (in a bad Al Gore impression) "this" is audible
[20:45:24] * javalover forgets what al gore sounds like & youtubes it
[20:46:27] * javalover laughs hysterically at the "sex scandal" al gore videos just cuz we all know he learned from the biggest pimp president ever!
[20:47:04] <shoky> presidents & their vices.. are overrated.
[20:47:09] <greggies> he sounds like the "this is audible" guy from the beginning of the audio books
[20:47:19] <greggies> crossed with a little dr. phil
[20:48:20] <greggies> shoky: i agree, just let them do their jobs
[20:53:29] <shoky> more importantly let me do mine
[20:57:23] <Ziber> Alright, so, I want to hide a button and then show it after something else is clicked. How can I do this?
[20:57:55] <shoky> with  .hide()   .click()   .show()
[20:58:10] <Ziber> i can just .hide() in my doc ready function and .show() when i want to?
[20:58:12] <Ziber> alright.
[20:58:27] <shoky> if you want it hidden on doc ready
[20:58:35] <shoky> then you can just have it hidden in your css..
[20:58:41] <shoky> but whatever.
[21:01:10] <Ziber> which is better, performance wise?
[21:01:46] <shoky> css
[21:04:10] <Ziber> How can I get the number of checkboxes that are currently checked?
[21:04:27] <raj> can I ensure that ev.target is a particular class, and not any of its children?
[21:04:49] <tw2113> you could loop through them, check for :checked being true, and if it is, increment a variable, or i wonder if there's some jquery function that can count
[21:05:16] <raj> I'm doing if($rawtarget.hasClass('foo')) return $rawtarget; else return $rawtarget.closest('.foo')
[21:05:47] <raj> but it's trigger the eventhandler multiple times because of that
[21:05:49] <Ziber> tw2113: i think there's a jquery one.
[21:06:00] <raj> since the actual ev.target could be the desired class or any of the children
[21:06:14] <raj> var $rawtarget = $(ev.target), btw
[21:06:37] <shoky> raj can you ask that again :)
[21:06:43] <raj> damn
[21:06:44] <raj> haha
[21:06:58] <raj> I have var $rawtarget = $(ev.target)
[21:07:06] <raj> ..for a mouseover event
[21:07:31] * specijalac slaps shoky around a bit with a large trout
[21:07:53] <shoky> patience, specijalac
[21:07:57] <raj> and then i'm doing `var $target=function(){if $rawtarget.hasClass('foo'))return $rawtarget}else{return $rawtarget.closest('.foo')}}()`
[21:08:15] <raj> to make sure the $target i'm working on is always the same
[21:08:38] <shoky> umm
[21:08:44] <raj> however, anytime i move my mouse from one child within foo to another child within foo, it retriggers this mouseover event
[21:08:49] <raj> (and the mouseout event)
[21:09:19] <shoky> don't you mean:  var $target = $rawtarget.hasClass('foo') ? $rawtarget : $rawtarget.closest('.foo')
[21:09:24] <shoky> why the function ;)
[21:09:48] <raj> yes, that'd probably be better :)
[21:10:05] <shoky> wait
[21:10:15] <shoky> doesnt .closest also look at the current element
[21:10:17] <shoky> mm
[21:10:19] <shoky> ?closest
[21:10:20] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[21:10:23] <shoky> yeah
[21:10:34] <shoky> so... $target = $rawtarget.closest('.foo')  :P
[21:10:35] <raj> ya, it gets my desired parent for me
[21:10:37] <shoky> var
[21:10:47] <shoky> no?
[21:11:28] <raj> oh, when I tried it, it didn't find itself, it was the $rawtarget and had .foo
[21:11:49] <shoky> oh.. that would mean either the docs lie or you derped ;P
[21:12:18] <raj> probably the latter
[21:12:22] <shoky> ;D
[21:13:03] <raj> anyway, can I make sure I don't get multiple ejaculations of 'mouseover' due to the different children being $rawtargets?
[21:13:08] <shoky> LOlL
[21:13:37] <shoky> that ejaculation of yours was unexpected
[21:13:53] <raj> usually is
[21:14:05] <shoky> :-]
[21:14:17] <raj> at least to the participating party
[21:14:26] <shoky> ummmmmmm i donno, fiddle it :D
[21:14:36] <shoky> hard to think without seeing it
[21:14:51] <shoky> also its 7am
[21:15:06] <tw2113> come on people, you should know by now to fiddle shit
[21:15:46] <shoky> tw2113 that should be the one signle item in your list :P
[21:15:49] <shoky> single
[21:15:59] <tw2113> :P
[21:16:07] <tw2113> actually it'd be #2
[21:16:13] <shoky> assholes
[21:16:17] <tw2113> #1 still being "don't be a douchbag"
[21:16:21] <shoky> ah douchebag
[21:16:21] <shoky> s
[21:18:02] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/CUyUD/13/
[21:22:17] <shoky> hrm its supposed to be simple but im derping
[21:23:09] <raj> aha, so i'm not such a derp
[21:23:38] <javalover> shoky you here?
[21:24:04] <javalover> real quick imma google it if you don't answer but...I have this.style.top cuz of old javascript...what's proper syntax for new javascript?
[21:24:15] <shoky> new javascript?
[21:24:16] <javalover> I.E. jquery haha
[21:24:18] <raj> haha
[21:24:30] <tw2113> same javascript
[21:24:33] <javalover> I know i've been coding all day so out of it
[21:24:34] <shoky> $(this).css('top')
[21:24:39] <raj> $('#someselector').css('top')
[21:24:40] <raj> damnit
[21:24:42] <javalover> nice nice
[21:24:47] <javalover> no you win too raj
[21:24:49] <shoky> or  .position().top
[21:24:57] * javalover gives 10 duke dollars to raj
[21:25:02] <shoky> ;>
[21:25:06] * javalover gives 10 duke dollars to shoky to be spent in the kindness store
[21:25:12] <shoky> lol
[21:25:16] <shoky> you really are a lover.
[21:25:18] <shoky> er.
[21:25:47] <javalover> I try
[21:25:57] <raj> shoky, can i force bubbling up to a class?
[21:26:17] <javalover> zomg my hero it  works!
[21:26:39] <javalover> holy shit that is awesome, it works for all of them
[21:26:49] <javalover> I should make a jquery class
[21:27:07] <javalover> ok so I know they have plugins for like sticky notes or whatever
[21:27:14] <javalover> but I tried to use those & failed so I wrote my own
[21:27:18] <shoky> raj: dont think so (but not sure what you mean exactly)
[21:27:31] <javalover> this thing, you scroll down & like it'll stop scrolling in one area & continue the rest of scrolling
[21:27:39] <raj> so that it bubbles up in the eventbinding itself
[21:27:53] <javalover> does anyone think I should make this a plugin?
[21:28:42] <raj> so it won't trigger for each mouseover of a different bar
[21:28:43] <rohanrhu> shoky: im back thank you
[21:28:43] <javalover> it's pretty cool & took me a long time to make it
[21:28:58] <raj> damn shoky, looks like you've built up mad karma points
[21:29:18] <javalover> my chess tournament is starting, guys if you want me to make my scroll thing a plugin
[21:29:20] <javalover> please pm me
[21:29:26] <raj> i think you can trade those in for a teddybear or a yoyo or something
[21:29:39] <raj> javalover, what scroll thing?
[21:29:42] <javalover> honestly like this thing is really cool but it does look like the sticky scroll
[21:29:54] <javalover> here's how it works raj, say you're scrolling & then you want to stop scrolling of one area & continue another
[21:30:09] <javalover> and then on the way back up scrolling you want it to do the reverse, that's how it works it's awesome
[21:30:23] <raj> you don't have a demo?
[21:30:28] <raj> cuz i have no idea what you're talking about
[21:31:22] <shoky> ah raj
[21:31:38] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/CUyUD/17/
[21:31:42] <shoky> mouseenter & mouseleave PLX
[21:32:01] <shoky> toldja its simple ;p
[21:32:45] <shoky> raj i'll take a yoyo!
[21:32:56] <raj> haha
[21:33:01] <raj> what's the difference with these events?
[21:33:32] <javalover> schooled that kid in chess
[21:33:36] <javalover> raj I can make a demo
[21:33:44] <shoky> raj: the demo here shows it : http://api.jquery.com/mouseover/
[21:33:58] <javalover> raj help shoky out but the way it works is like this
[21:34:08] <raj> javalover, fics?
[21:34:22] <shoky> raj the difference is pretty much what you saw in the 2 fiddle
[21:34:23] <javalover> you scroll down and everything is scrolling, then the top of the page stops scrolling but the bottom continues underneath the top
[21:34:24] <shoky> s
[21:34:41] <shoky> mouseover fires when the pointer moves into the child element as well, while mouseenter fires only when the pointer moves into the bound element.
[21:35:18] <javalover> it's good for keeping stuff on the page that you scrolled 2 & then having the rest continue to scroll
[21:35:25] <shoky> heh raj that docs page says:  This event type can cause many headaches due to event bubbling.
[21:35:29] <shoky> (about mouseover)
[21:35:42] <javalover> in my case I scroll down to some hyperlinks & then continue scrolling
[21:35:57] <raj> damn
[21:36:00] <raj> good to know
[21:36:15] <javalover> so I was thinking maybe I should make a plugin out of this and then everyone can have it
[21:36:22] <javalover> since you guys helped me I figure I should help you as well
[21:37:02] <javalover> raj I think i'll make a fiddle, it's just i'm tired right now
[21:37:09] <javalover> so maybe after chess i'll make a fiddle so you can see it
[21:43:31] <shoky> which opening you gonna go for ?!?!?!
[21:44:48] <raj> shoky, can I cancel a previous mouseenter/mouseleave event when a new one starts?
[21:45:02] <shoky> well, the previous events already happened
[21:45:05] <raj> like if i run my mouse back and forth over the container really fast
[21:45:07] <shoky> maybe you wanna cancel the animation?
[21:45:34] <raj> sure
[21:45:41] <raj> how can I do that?
[21:46:14] <shoky> .stop()
[21:46:16] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/CUyUD/19/
[21:47:15] <raj> who are you
[21:47:18] <raj> and how do you freaking know that
[21:47:22] <shoky> then you get a cool "undecisive" graph
[21:47:25] <shoky> lolll
[21:47:28] <raj> it's not even in the docs
[21:47:34] <shoky> .stop?? sure it is
[21:47:37] <shoky> ?stop
[21:47:37] <bot-t> .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[21:47:59] <shoky> if you'd read .animate  you'd see it referred to as well :P
[21:48:12] <raj> they should probably mention it in animate
[21:48:14] <raj> they dont'!
[21:48:16] <shoky> hmm
[21:48:25] <shoky> true
[21:48:45] <shoky> yea they should
[21:49:05] <raj> the docs need to be on github
[21:49:06] <shoky> i think all the api docs should have 'see also' sections
[21:49:11] <shoky> yea
[21:49:32] <shoky> wait, they're njot?
[21:49:32] <tw2113> +1 for "see also"
[21:49:32] <shoky> not?
[21:49:54] <shoky> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-docs
[21:50:22] <shoky> hmm
[21:50:25] <raj> oh, hm
[21:50:42] <shoky> doesnt seem to be it tho
[21:51:12] <shoky> only for jquery-ui maybe
[21:51:36] * tw2113 watches The Dark Knight Rises trailers
[21:52:10] <shoky> i didnt like the dark knight  :\
[21:52:17] <shoky> but cool to know there's a new one coming up
[21:52:38] * tw2113 labels shoky as inhuman
[21:52:42] <tw2113> jk....maybe
[21:52:49] <shoky> i liked the one before
[21:52:54] <shoky> im very picky with movies
[21:53:11] <tw2113> i was thinking about breaking out  Batman Begins tonight yet
[21:53:27] <tw2113> i'll call it a break from the Game of Thrones audiobook i worked my way through part of today
[21:53:33] <shoky> yea i liked that one
[21:54:47] <shoky> sorry, nothing tops jack nicholson for me
[21:55:17] <shoky> the dark knight felt too .. american
[21:55:43] <shoky> too flashy, too full of itself, etc.
[21:55:59] <tw2113> where are you located at on the planet?
[21:56:05] <rodd> wanna watch a great movie?
[21:56:07] <rodd> La Jetee

[21:56:32] <tw2113> coulda just said the holy land
[21:56:38] <systemfault> Lulz.
[21:56:48] <shoky> doesnt seem too holy from here ;P
[21:57:02] <tw2113> well, people there spell it holey
[21:57:09] <systemfault> I feel a bit safer in my unholy land that is canada.
[21:57:12] <tw2113> thanks to the US bombing the general area for a decade
[21:57:31] <shoky> rodd: looks interesting
[21:57:39] <rodd> canada is nice
[21:57:54] <shoky> i might move to canada in a few years yea

[21:58:50] <shoky> i order my weed from there ;P
[21:58:58] <systemfault> Haha
[21:59:07] <tw2113> cold but free health care
[21:59:09] <shoky> would be awesome to not have to do that anymore :D
[21:59:16] <systemfault> It's been…. more than 10 years since the last time I smoked weed
[21:59:27] <raj> how can I check if 2012-05-27T04:55:20.182033 was greater than 24hrs ago?

[21:59:49] <raj> me 2
[21:59:59] <rodd> me 3
[22:00:03] <shoky> i never remember the APIs and its such a bummer to relearn them each time
[22:00:20] <tw2113> i wish i had a date
[22:00:24] <tw2113> oops, wrong kind
[22:00:25] <raj> i'm using moment.js
[22:00:27] <shoky> hate those too ;D
[22:00:40] <shoky> ah, haven't tried that yet
[22:00:58] <raj> http://momentjs.com/
[22:01:20] <shoky> yea i've seen it recommended here many times
[22:01:34] <raj> every library should have an online link to a /moment.latest.js
[22:01:40] <rodd> getUTCHours() ?
[22:01:43] <tw2113> ooh, that's difficult. Just found my burned dvd with Batman Begins...it also has Highlander on it
[22:01:44] <raj> or whatever the library name
[22:01:51] <shoky> lol highlander
[22:01:58] <shoky> i wonder if i'd still enjoy it today
[22:02:08] <shoky> i remember loving it when i was..... 12 or smth
[22:02:13] <systemfault> Batman Begins is a good movie
[22:02:19] <systemfault> Highlander… meh
[22:03:16] <shoky> some lady from work wants to buy me a used mac so we can start developing some iphone shit
[22:03:31] <shoky> y'all know what minimal hardware i need to get her to buy ?
[22:03:34] <tw2113> make it a new mac and then send it to me
[22:03:41] <rodd> macmini?
[22:03:43] <shoky> o ok she'd like dat
[22:03:48] <tw2113> i would :D
[22:03:51] <shoky> ;>
[22:04:19] <shoky> some dude told me i need 4GB ram at least
[22:04:23] <shoky> dat true?
[22:04:38] <species> for what?
[22:04:40] <tw2113> i need to find spare money, buy a TB drive or two, and get rid of all of these DVDs I have burned holding shit
[22:04:49] <shoky> she doesnt wanna spend much
[22:04:58] <shoky> she cant ;s
[22:05:08] <shoky> mmm spare money
[22:05:09] <tw2113> i heard most people get like 3-6gb for their mac machines
[22:05:11] <shoky> i miss that
[22:06:11] <shoky> im afraid she'll buy some junk and then we'll see it cant handle xcode or some shit
[22:06:29] <systemfault> shoky: 4GB of ram is limit
[22:06:42] <systemfault> THat's what I currently have on my system.
[22:06:48] <systemfault> I would like to have more :/
[22:06:55] <shoky> oks.. 4 it is
[22:07:06] <species> what I want to do is have like 64gb ram, with a battery in it, and use it as an HDD
[22:07:11] <species> can you still make ramdrives these days?
[22:07:27] <shoky> and i can install osx lion on any macmini with core2duo minimum + 4gb  ?
[22:07:56] <shoky> and then just pay $99 and be able to make a goddamn iphone app alrady?
[22:08:02] <shoky> fucking apple :(
[22:08:15] <shoky> sorry for rant
[22:08:40] <systemfault> Well.. 99$ for a year… is pretty cheap to me.
[22:09:05] <shoky> and you need a mac
[22:09:15] <systemfault> Yeah :P
[22:09:18] <shoky> ;P
[22:12:20] <tw2113> i wanna know why mac people are so tolerant of NEEDING so much ram
[22:12:40] <systemfault> tw2113: You mean?
[22:13:03] <tw2113> my desktop runs fine on 3gb and usually doesn't even use that much
[22:13:30] <systemfault> A typical windows machine uses most of that.
[22:13:31] <tw2113> but i swear the mac people are like "i need a LOT of ram, but it's a mac, so I'll just deal with that fact"
[22:13:49] <tw2113> i do Linux, so that likely helps
[22:14:02] <systemfault> tw2113: On linux, it depends on several factors.. :/
[22:14:21] <systemfault> Someone using openbox… will use less ram than a full gnome 3/kde desktop
[22:14:38] <tw2113> fluxbox :D
[22:14:43] <systemfault> :P
[22:14:57] <tw2113> gnome 3 below it though
[22:16:06] <tw2113> woo chinese prison opening scene
[22:16:25] <systemfault> tw2113: What movie?
[22:16:31] <tw2113> Batman Begins
[22:16:33] <systemfault> Ahhh
[22:16:48] <shoky> hmm damn
[22:16:54] <systemfault> I saw it again recently… Then found something weird..
[22:17:01] <shoky> i'll have to get batman begins again
[22:17:10] <systemfault> It's pretty much the same story than "The shadow"
[22:17:16] <systemfault> An old movie on the 90s
[22:18:55] <tw2113> i think that one is based off of a comic book too
[22:19:19] <Ziber> If I want to update the text of a button element, I should just be able to $("#button").text("Whatever"); right?
[22:19:22] <tw2113> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111143/
[22:21:28] <shoky> Ziber: or with .val("bla") if it's an <input>
[22:21:47] <Ziber> its a <button>
[22:22:18] <shoky> then .text yes
[22:22:30] <Ziber> Because I can't get it to work. http://sandbox.liber.in/cr/network.php
[22:22:54] <Ziber> click the checkboxes and the button will show up, but the next wont change based on the counter variable i have.
[22:23:26] <Ziber> And the button wont go away when the count is zero... :(
[22:23:29] <shoky> what won't change/
[22:23:30] <shoky> ?
[22:23:43] <Ziber> the text of the "Delete Network" button to "Delete Networks"
[22:24:06] <newbiee> i am getting a attempt to tun compile and go script on cleared scope
[22:24:26] <Ziber> what does that mean? :/
[22:24:29] <shoky> Ziber: you're not doing .text() on it..
[22:24:48] <Ziber> $("#delNetworkButton").text("Delete Networks");
[22:25:16] <shoky> i dont see that there..
[22:25:23] * Ziber sighs
[22:25:27] <Ziber> duh, sec.
[22:26:08] <Ziber> i implemented an svn structure and forgot to copy it to the right directory
[22:26:13] <Ziber> there.
[22:26:36] <newbiee> i am using $.post to get the contents of a page into div and i am getting the above error message
[22:26:44] <newbiee> it works on one page but not in another
[22:27:36] <newbiee> I get a div tag on another page
[22:33:31] <rocLv> hi, guys
[22:33:39] <systemfault> HAI GUYS
[22:33:57] <shoky> heuahuehuaehuaheuaheua
[22:33:59] <newbiee> $.post is redirecting the page which it should not
[22:34:01] <rocLv> I have a problem with jquery ui' datepicker
[22:34:10] <shoky> goodnight
[22:34:19] <systemfault> shoky: Good night
[22:34:48] <rocLv> <div  id="datepicker"><a href="#">link</a></div>
[22:35:38] <rocLv> then I want to click the link to make datepicker show
[22:37:08] <rocLv> here is my code
[22:37:10] <rocLv> $('#datepicker a').click(function(){
[22:37:11] <rocLv> 		$('#datepicker').datepicker("show");
[22:37:11] <rocLv> 	});
[22:37:38] <rocLv> but it did not work at all
[22:39:14] <rocLv> anyone can help me?
[22:39:54] <rocLv> must datepicker be used with <input>?
[22:42:58] <newbiee> does $.post redirect the page on ajaxcall?
[22:51:54] <Ziber> How can I make an array of the checkboxes that are checked to send, in an $.ajax()?
[23:00:16] <tw2113> Ziber you just keep chipping away at this don't you
[23:01:10] <tw2113> loops are awesome btw
[23:01:23] <tw2113> same with if statements
[23:01:41] <tw2113> you can check if something is checked, and if true, just stuff it into an existing array
[23:12:49] <Ziber> tw2113: I'm building a website, realize I don't know how to do something, google it and then come ask.
[23:12:58] <Ziber> Can I send a JS array to a PHP via $.ajax()?
[23:13:11] <psyolus> Weird
[23:13:35] <psyolus> When I insert an element into the DOM with a data-something attribute that CSS styles by, I have to click on said element for the styling to take effect.
[23:13:36] <psyolus> So weird.
[23:14:30] <Ziber> Nah, it posts it weird. JS function to convert array to a string?
[23:17:05] <systemfault> Ziber: You cannot convert a list of DOM elements to a string.
[23:17:28] <systemfault> But for normal objects, you would use JSON.stringify
[23:17:42] <systemfault> If you do use it… don't forget to include json2.js for older browsers.
[23:19:31] <newbiee> https://php.privatepaste.com/5c1f78b808
[23:20:27] <tw2113> or tell older browsers to stick it :D
[23:20:37] <tw2113> systemfault which browsers need it?
[23:20:42] <tw2113> out of curiosity
[23:20:50] <systemfault> tw2113: IE7 I'm sure
[23:20:54] <systemfault> IE8.. not sure :/
[23:21:27] <tw2113> is it needed for pulling in JSON too? like twitter feeds?
[23:21:49] <systemfault> tw2113: It has nothing to do with pulling JSON
[23:22:02] <systemfault> tw2113: jquery has its own JSON parser though
[23:22:04] <tw2113> then i'm not worrying :D
[23:22:15] <tw2113> i don't do much for sending json, just parsing
[23:25:09] <thinkerbell> Hi, I was looking at the jquery ui website, anyone can help me, I can't seem to find the docs for the overlay widget
[23:34:43] <asdf1231> when using .append() for a <img> how do i bind a load() event to that img? it doesn't seem to work for me, .append('<img id='img-load' src="..." />') .... $('#img-load').load( ... )
[23:36:16] <systemfault> asdf1231: You must bind the load event before setting the src
[23:37:32] <asdf1231> well, that is what i'm doing, but i think the issue is, it doesn't bind to anything as it never gets triggered because the element does exist
[23:37:43] <asdf1231> doesn't*
[23:37:51] <systemfault> ?
[23:38:32] <asdf1231> the img element #img-load doesn't exist into i append it, so setting a .load() for #img-load won't matter an element doesn't exist when the JS code gets loaded
[23:38:49] <asdf1231> into = until*
[23:38:58] <systemfault> Of course it exists..
[23:39:15] <asdf1231> huh? how does it exist if i don't append it yet?
[23:39:27] <systemfault> The node is simply "out of the main DOM tree"
[23:39:33] <systemfault> It's still there
[23:40:24] <asdf1231> so you're saying appending an empty src img? then bind it to load() then change the img src?
[23:40:34] <systemfault> No...
[23:40:49] <systemfault> You create the node, then add it's .load handler then set its .src
[23:41:21] <asdf1231> how do i create a node? i always thought node creation starts when it's added to the dom? (append in this case)
[23:41:22] <systemfault> var image = $('<img>'); image.on('load', function(){}); image.prop('src', 'www.asdasdasdasd.com/lol.jpg');
[23:41:39] <systemfault> var image = $('<img>'); creates the node
[23:42:05] <asdf1231> ok, thanks, let me try that out
[23:44:55] <ryanaz> why is it that my .load functions great if it's in the <body> </body> but doesn't work if it's in the <head> </head >  ?
[23:45:34] <ryanaz> I would imagine that jquery functions shouldn't matter if they're in the <body> < script > ... </script> </body> .. or if they're in the <head> ...
[23:45:49] <systemfault> ryanaz: Do you have a testcase or URL?
[23:46:06] <asdf1231> isn't that a case of the element not existing?
[23:46:08] <ryanaz> systemfault:  ya ... 1 sec
[23:46:24] <asdf1231> because it came before the element you are binding load to was parsed?
[23:47:52] <thinkerbell> asdf1231, try live() or on()
[23:48:33] <thinkerbell> asdf1231, I think thats what you need, cause when you add element, you need to bind them, which is what live() or the new way on() will do for you
[23:49:51] <ryanaz> WORKS IN BODY:  http://beta.stratfuel.com/test1.html    DOES NOT WORK IN HEAD: http://beta.stratfuel.com/test2.html
[23:50:56] <systemfault> ryanaz: The browser parses your html file from top to bottom executing all the scripts it seems
[23:50:58] <systemfault> *sees
[23:51:18] <systemfault> ryanaz: At the moment where your javascript is read in the head, the element it targets doesn't yet exists
[23:51:34] <ryanaz> huh ... so it is executing the scripts in <head> prior to the body loading?
[23:51:46] <systemfault> ryanaz: Nah.. just from top to bottom
[23:52:30] <systemfault> ryanaz: What you can do is defer the execution of the javascript until the DOM tree is in its "ready" state
[23:52:44] <ryanaz> where do you set that?
[23:52:44] <asdf1231> you need to wrap the script with a $(function() {});
[23:52:55] <systemfault> ryanaz: Like asdf1231 said
[23:53:12] <ryanaz> asdf1231: got a link to give an example?
[23:53:19] <systemfault> $(function() { $('#fbo_fuel_update_info_locations').load("api/locations.cgi?id_community=133&id_other=54321&id_test=1234"); });
[23:53:33] <ryanaz> and when does it execute that function?
[23:53:39] <systemfault> ryanaz: http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[23:53:49] <systemfault> ryanaz: As soon as the whole body is parsed
[23:54:02] <ryanaz> ..trying
[23:54:16] <asdf1231> silly question, how do i append image in your example sys? it's appending the stringified version of the object image
[23:54:34] <asdf1231> .append('...' + image + '....')
[23:54:37] <systemfault> Ahhh
[23:54:46] <ryanaz> http://beta.stratfuel.com/test3.html
[23:54:46] <systemfault> asdf1231: You can't do that
[23:54:51] <ryanaz> looks like that worked systemfault
[23:54:58] <systemfault> asdf1231: You select the node then append() the element
[23:55:26] <systemfault> asdf1231: If you have a fragment, you can select the image within it
[23:56:23] <systemfault> asdf1231: var fragment = $('<div><img></div>'); var image = fragment.find('img'); image.on('load', function(){}); image.prop('src', 'asdsadsdsadada.com/lol.jpg');
[23:58:26] <asdf1231> this is what i'm trying to do
[23:58:28] <asdf1231> http://jsfiddle.net/yAFP7/
[23:58:38] <asdf1231> or well, the way i was trying to get it to work
[23:59:18] <asdf1231> oh never mind -_-
[23:59:26] <asdf1231> i just have to declare .load() after my append
