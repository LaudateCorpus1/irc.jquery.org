[05:16:49] <tigismiley> Hi, I am having a problem loading my work application because it seems like maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com has stopped being reachable from my location (Kenya).
[05:16:50] <tigismiley> What should I do?
[08:56:22] <wil3> Hi, I'm doing a lot of work in VS Code - is there anyway to link a .js file to a html file so I can get relevant code hints/suggestions based on the element I selected?
[12:39:35] <Gh0st_Preacher> wil3 might need some clarification there - what sorts of suggestions are you looking for?
[13:00:08] <Cork> and why would that be a jquery question...
[13:00:43] <robertmaxrees> orthogonally related i suppose :shrug:
[16:38:15] <Cork> wil3: you would have to ask that to users of the editor your using
[16:46:01] <robertmaxrees> i was going to point out that the question seemed odd in the first place imho
[16:46:17] <robertmaxrees> depending on the expected functionality :shrug:
[21:31:33] <easier2ndtime> i need to "make it rain" from a waterfall or shower except instead of droplets, its tiny css hearts. can someone show me how? https://blog.bitsrc.io/the-anatomy-of-a-pure-css-heart-70a1e8bb5223
[21:32:02] <robertmaxrees> that's a pretty broad question :)
[21:32:55] <easier2ndtime> not in thsoe exact words hehehe
[21:32:59] <easier2ndtime> i mean
[21:33:09] <easier2ndtime> a stream of hearts flowing upwards for isntance
[21:33:23] <easier2ndtime> in a swirly motion kinda
[21:33:36] <easier2ndtime> css would be too primal for something like that right?
[21:34:04] <robertmaxrees> "primal"??  css would be part of the solution.
[21:35:55] <easier2ndtime> for the motion too?
[21:36:53] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways to handle stuff like that.  css has pretty robust animation support these days.  just depends on what all you're trying to accomplish./
[21:39:10] <easier2ndtime> hmm
[21:39:21] <easier2ndtime> i wish i could recall where i saw it
[21:39:40] <robertmaxrees> tis channel is a little more geared towards specific questions around jquery instead of broad "can shomebody show me how to build this random effect?"
[21:39:46] <robertmaxrees> *type questions.
[21:39:46] <easier2ndtime> it was either on match in a dating app, or on add to cart at an online store
[21:39:54] <easier2ndtime> come on man!
[21:40:03] <easier2ndtime> there are no such things as stupid questions :(
[21:40:12] <robertmaxrees> i didn't say it was a stupid question.
[21:40:35] <robertmaxrees> just trying to give you some guidance :)  break the problem down into component steps and solve each of those :)
[21:40:44] <easier2ndtime> that is a good idea
[21:40:51] <robertmaxrees> that's programming
[21:40:56] <easier2ndtime> :D
