[00:56:11] <senaps> how we can change how a class is given it's options? https://jsfiddle.net/rpkxhq5h/
[01:11:12] <phelix> Isn't there a channel on freenode to outsorce work to for pay?
[02:30:14] <senaps> https://codepen.io/senaps/pen/QaMwYa and https://codepen.io/senaps/pen/pprvqV are the same code, but with different writing, but they act differently! how so?
[02:32:25] <Woet> perhaps they are not the same code.
[02:36:43] <senaps> will they are not exact same code (syntax is different obviously), but they should act the same way, shouldn't they?
[02:44:58] <Woet> senaps: evidently not.
[02:45:37] <senaps> where are they different then? you see it, i don't and probebly this is what the problem is! :)
[02:46:07] <senaps> tell me in what they are different and maybe that's the fix the code needs.
[02:49:21] <jayaura> Hi all, I have a button on a page which refreshes the data in a table on the page by calling a javascript function. How can I trace what http api is the function calling ? I basically want to know the real source of the data
[02:51:45] <senaps> developer tools, console or network..... check one of these tabs and you see the requests going in/out
[02:52:12] <Woet> senaps: https://www.diffchecker.com/h4ThuQLO
[03:01:02] <senaps> Woet this diff isn't the cause of fail :(  the problem is that second code isn't reading the properties right :(  this might be api thing and should check it with the developers of this thing.
[03:03:42] <jayaura> senaps: thanks for your response. I used the firefox developer console to find see the http get and post requests made on the page. But it is still not showing what https apis are being called in the background by javascript functions. I can see the data changing in realtime on the page, but no http reqiuests being shows in the "network" tab of the developer tools in firefox
[03:04:12] <jayaura> where should I look for finding what exactly the javascript functions do?
[03:46:41] <senaps> jayaura you could check the data from console tab too, and by clicking in sub tabs, you can check the session and headers and the data flow being sent/recived over the network. or maybe your website isn't using requests and has a socket to the server?
[03:47:17] <jayaura> senaps: looks like it uses websockets
[09:40:44] <poboy> ok, you guys normally ask for markup so here goes.  When ".open_service" is clicked we want it to turn red, but only if the parent list item (.dashboard-list-element)  has this attribute:  data-highlight="1"
[09:40:49] <poboy> https://jsfiddle.net/gtjqsuLc/
[09:46:40] <AdamPDotty> hmm, are all your buttons in question inside the container with that attribute?
[09:48:19] <poboy> the ones that we want to change, yes
[09:49:40] <AdamPDotty> maybe this gives you an idea: https://jsfiddle.net/gtjqsuLc/1/
[09:50:55] <AdamPDotty> quite possible, there is a better way though
[09:51:53] <poboy> so in that case, instead of searching the document, it just searches for data-highlight =1
[09:52:27] <poboy> what is the better way?  I was trying to do this last night, figured it would take 20 minutes or so but no dice
[09:52:55] <AdamPDotty> Well, it attaches the handler to the element with data-highlight = 1. That way the event is only caught inside it.
[09:54:50] <shoky_> poboy: translating your question directly to jquery:  if ( $(this).closest('.dashboard-list-element').is('[data-highlight="1"]') )
[09:55:51] <poboy> shoky_, thanks.  I didn't even know jquery had an .is method, lol
[09:56:10] <shoky_> poboy: even if it didn't you could just do  $(this).closest(...).length > 0
[09:56:28] <shoky_> well, not exactly the same thing
[09:58:07] <shoky_> also of course there's .attr('data-highlight') === '1'   or with .data('highlight')
[09:59:32] <poboy> yeah, just trying to call it correctly
[10:03:41] <poboy> still haven't figured it out.  :(
[10:06:15] <shoky_> poboy: https://jsfiddle.net/gtjqsuLc/2/
[10:08:27] <poboy> shoky_, it should only turn red if the main list item is red.  in that example, if you click on "Act Letter" it will turn red but the only one that should change is Answer Only
[10:10:49] <shoky_> poboy: i just did what you said at first:   we want it to turn red, but only if the parent list item (.dashboard-list-element)  has this attribute:  data-highlight="1"
[10:11:03] <poboy> just realized there are multiple dashboard-list-elements in each list item
[10:11:51] <poboy> so the parent's parent?
[10:14:17] <poboy> if the dashboard-list-element on line 1 has data-highlight == 1 then I want the code to execute  https://kopy.io/plus4
[10:14:39] <poboy> as the code is written, aren't we checking the dashboard-list-element on line 10?
[10:15:42] <shoky_> poboy: it's not the dashboart-list-element that has the data-highlight..
[10:16:08] <poboy> it's the a tag inside it
[10:16:26] <shoky_> poboy: this works.. https://jsfiddle.net/gtjqsuLc/3/
[10:16:47] <poboy> perfect!  thank you!
[10:16:54] <poboy> sorry for my stupidity
[10:17:34] <shoky_> np
[11:49:37] <sine0> folks what is the one that will action when someone selects off or away from an input field
[11:51:11] <Woet> blur
[11:52:01] <sine0> on change got it
[11:52:45] <Woet> no, that depends on change.
[11:52:46] <Woet> as the name implies.
[11:52:47] <taplar> change will not always fire on loss of focus, which is what you asked originally
[11:52:51] <Woet> i already answered your question.
[11:52:54] <Woet> [00:51:10]  <Woet>	blur
[11:53:35] <sine0> I thought you were chomping me
[11:53:53] <sine0> so for real its on blue ?
[11:54:02] <Woet> i answered it twice now
[11:54:03] <sine0> blur i mean. ok ill googs it
[11:54:06] <Woet> i'm sure that's sufficient
[11:54:17] <sine0> have you checked the list to see if i have been naughty or nice ?
[11:54:29] <taplar> wut?
[11:54:35] <sine0> santa claus is coming to town.
[11:54:43] <taplar> k
[11:59:13] <sine0> ok blue is pretty cool thanks for that one. weird name tho./
[11:59:22] <sine0> and by blue I mean blur, I keep typing it wrong
[11:59:36] <taplar> it's the inverse of focus
[11:59:44] <taplar> so in context it makes sense
[11:59:48] <sine0> ok well in that case it does make sense
[12:00:24] <sine0> Does jQuery have access to unixtime
[12:00:41] <taplar> if your on a unix box, sure
[12:00:54] <taplar> javascript time is just the machine time
[12:01:03] <Duikb00t_> Hi, what could be the reason I have to double click on the 'navbar-toggle' class after I have clicked an item with jquery?
[12:01:09] <Duikb00t_> The ul slides up but to slide down again I have to click twice.
[12:01:36] <taplar> Duikb00t_: make sure you're not double binding any event handlers
[12:03:02] <Duikb00t_> Well, taplar  this is how to code for that part looks like: https://kopy.io/zLT7O
[12:03:15] <Duikb00t_> 1) attempt: The menu slides down after 1 click.
[12:03:20] <Duikb00t_> 2) I click an item
[12:03:29] <Duikb00t_> 3) the menu slides up.
[12:03:42] <Duikb00t_> 4) I click the toggle stuff again to slide down the menu... nothing happends.
[12:03:53] <Duikb00t_> 5) When I click again, it slides down.
[12:04:18] <taplar> when is resizeHeader called?
[12:04:41] <Duikb00t_> Above line 1o of my paste: $window .resize(resize) .trigger('resize');
[12:05:01] <taplar> on window resize?
[12:05:09] <Duikb00t_> 1 second
[12:05:12] <Duikb00t_> I expand the paste.
[12:05:45] <Duikb00t_> https://kopy.io/Mbb1N
[12:06:07] <taplar> yeah don't do that
[12:06:31] <taplar> your going to call the resize method every time the window resizes, which can result it duplicate bindings since you are creating a binding in that method
[12:06:52] <Duikb00t_> I understand. What could be a solution to keep the resize handler workign?
[12:08:29] <taplar> can the user click a 'navbar-default ul li a' if the navbar is not visible?
[12:09:11] <Duikb00t_> If not on mobile, yes.
[12:09:43] <taplar> ok, then is there a case where clicking one of those links should -not- cause the menu to slide up?
[12:10:02] <Duikb00t_> No.
[12:10:04] <Duikb00t_> hmm
[12:10:11] <Duikb00t_> The ul should only slide up on mobile.
[12:10:52] <taplar> so really what you're after is a binding that is put on them once, and inside it should check to see if it is mobile or not to know if it should perform the slide up logic
[12:11:51] <taplar> which is an easy check with how you got the 'mobile' class put on the html tag
[12:11:58] <Duikb00t_> But hmm
[12:12:02] <taplar> r/tag/dom element/
[12:12:08] <Duikb00t_> if ($(".mobile")[0]){ I have such check
[12:12:25] <taplar> if ($html.hasClass('mobile'))
[12:12:31] <Duikb00t_> ;p or like that
[12:13:03] <Duikb00t_> Outside of the
[12:13:04] <taplar> brb, grabbing some food
[12:13:06] <Duikb00t_> resize handler right?
[12:13:08] <Duikb00t_> ok
[12:13:16] <taplar> yeah, that method wouldn't be in a resize anymore
[12:13:27] <taplar> you bind the the on handler for that just once
[12:14:21] <Duikb00t_> seems to work except :p I broke now the smooooth lsliding
[12:14:23] <Duikb00t_> fuckig
[12:14:30] <Duikb00t_> Have a great lunch!
[12:22:02] <Duikb00t_> I think I broke it again taplar_lunch
[12:23:00] <taplar_lunch> :(
[12:25:22] <Duikb00t_> I can send you in PM the link
[12:25:26] <Duikb00t_> if you might wnat to check it?
[12:26:03] <Duikb00t_> If you ahve a minute ;p
[12:26:26] <taplar_lunch> i may be slow to respond with my one hand typing
[12:26:59] <Duikb00t_> haha np.
[12:28:16] <taplar_lunch> is it the multiclick issue still or smooth scrollng now?
[12:28:23] <Duikb00t_> The mutliclick
[12:30:18] <taplar_lunch> menu looks like it works, though it stays open when you select one
[12:30:47] <Duikb00t_> yeah
[12:30:53] <Duikb00t_> it's 1 of both worlds ><
[12:31:17] <taplar_lunch> is the script on the page or in an included file?
[12:32:23] <Duikb00t_> extenral
[12:32:25] <Duikb00t_> external.
[12:32:42] <Duikb00t_> theme.js
[12:32:58] <taplar_lunch> k
[12:34:43] <taplar_lunch> try taking the if off
[12:35:13] <Duikb00t_> Which one
[12:35:23] <Duikb00t_> if($('.navbar-toggle').is(":visible")) {  ?
[12:36:21] <taplar_lunch> https://jsfiddle.net/2bnakxh0/
[12:36:57] <Duikb00t_> slideDown you mean
[12:37:01] <Duikb00t_> on the ul li a
[12:37:07] <taplar_lunch> the slide up one
[12:37:32] <taplar_lunch> you said slide up should only happen on mobile, right?
[12:37:37] <Duikb00t_> yes
[12:37:56] <Duikb00t_> dammit im confused a bit.
[12:38:08] <taplar_lunch> so the menu isn't visible on page load right?
[12:38:14] <Duikb00t_> true.
[12:38:20] <taplar_lunch> so the binding wouldn't be put on the links
[12:38:29] <Duikb00t_> If you refresh the page the code from the fiddle is applied.
[12:38:33] <taplar_lunch> which is why the visibility if would be removed
[12:38:39] <Duikb00t_> But then I have to click again twice > <
[12:42:49] <taplar_lunch> try moving the var $html above the binding.  I don't see a console error for that, but just to make sure
[12:43:04] <Duikb00t_> done
[12:43:16] <Duikb00t_> Argh still :(
[12:45:46] <taplar_lunch> the hasclass is coming back false for some reason
[12:46:13] <Duikb00t_> $html.addClass('mobile');   seems not to be added then? :s
[12:46:31] <taplar_lunch> the mobile class is not on the html, but i am in a mobile size
[12:46:41] <taplar_lunch> 375x667
[12:46:45] <taplar_lunch> but the class is not there
[12:47:44] <taplar_lunch> yeah somethings wrong with whatever is putting that class on the element
[12:48:33] <taplar_lunch> hah!
[12:48:35] <taplar_lunch> lol
[12:48:47] <taplar_lunch> look at your resize function
[12:48:53] <taplar_lunch> your remove class is not in an elese
[12:48:55] <taplar_lunch> *else
[13:13:20] <Duikb00t_> Hmm
[13:13:33] <Duikb00t_> oooh
[13:15:11] <Duikb00t_> taplar: added that now.
[13:15:23] <Duikb00t_> :(
[13:15:25] <Duikb00t_> now it's totally gone
[13:15:51] <Duikb00t_> I mean I can't click the trigger anymore wtf

[13:16:44] <robertmaxrees> sec
[13:16:59] <robertmaxrees> hah
[13:17:02] <robertmaxrees> already k-lined
[13:17:07] <kloeri_> yup :)
[13:17:13] <Duikb00t_> (Y_
[13:17:20] <kloeri_> I decided you could probably do without that bit of spam :)
[13:17:28] <taplar> much appreciated
[13:17:54] <Duikb00t_> thx
[13:17:59] * taplar eyes kloeri_
[13:18:01] <robertmaxrees> thanks much :)
[13:18:04] <taplar> you a server mod?
[13:18:16] <kloeri_> I'm a freenode staffer indeed
[13:18:23] <taplar> good to know
[13:18:26] <robertmaxrees> and a generally good dude
[13:18:32] <robertmaxrees> didn't realize y'all hung out in here hahaha
[13:18:36] <Duikb00t_> haha :p
[13:19:32] <kloeri_> robertmaxrees: I'm usually in some ~170 channels.. changes a bit over time as the situation (and my sanity) demands though
[13:19:44] <robertmaxrees> oh wow.  impressive.
[13:20:08] <taplar> like, actively in them, or do you have some scripts that alert you to key words?
[13:21:35] <kloeri_> I'm fairly active in a small subset and the rest of them I randomly participate a bit in when irssi takes me to them and I spot something that sounds interesting / fun / I don't know
[13:21:44] <kloeri_> and a fair few hilights of course
[13:21:55] <Brodingo> thanks for lookin out
[13:23:28] <Duikb00t_> damn taplar  ;p
[13:23:34] <taplar> hmm?
[13:25:36] <taplar> i'm not sure yet why the menu isn't coming back.  though interestingly I don't find the logic that does a slideDown when you click the outer menu
[13:25:56] <taplar> are you using the bootstrap menu toggle for the menu show?
[13:27:11] <taplar> instead of doing the slideUp, try doing this instead: $('.navbar-toggle').trigger('click')
[13:33:59] <Es0teric> question -- how do i trim characters on both sides of a string? for instance if i have something like ''/some-path/" and i want it to really be "some-path" ?
[13:34:23] <taplar> couple ways
[13:34:35] <taplar> you could slice(1, length -1)
[13:34:46] <robertmaxrees> or a regex.
[13:34:49] <taplar> or you could do a replace on '/' to ''
[13:35:09] <Es0teric> i think slice is what i want
[13:35:10] <Es0teric> lol
[13:35:12] <Es0teric> thanks
[13:35:26] <Duikb00t_> testing
[13:36:43] <Duikb00t_> Damn, I don't get it yet: $('.navbar-toggle').trigger('click')
[13:37:00] <Duikb00t_> $('.navbar-default ul li a').on('click', function() {
[13:37:02] <Duikb00t_> $('.navbar-default ul').slideUp();
[13:37:03] <Duikb00t_> is what I have now
[13:37:15] <taplar> you'd replace the slide up line with that trigger line
[13:38:05] <Duikb00t_> done
[13:38:28] <Duikb00t_> I see the white line below the menu bar is doing a bit strange
[13:38:32] <Duikb00t_> when clicking the toggle thigny
[13:38:43] <taplar> you put it in the wrong one, :)
[13:38:55] <Duikb00t_> oh man
[13:38:56] <taplar> you put it in the old one inside the visible check, which that block should really be commented or removed
[13:39:45] <Duikb00t_> m
[13:39:46] <taplar> well that's annoying
[13:39:59] <Duikb00t_> Liek this?
[13:40:10] <Duikb00t_> wtf
[13:40:11] <taplar> i need to find the bootstrap docs and see if it has a logical way to trigger a menu toggle
[13:40:13] <Duikb00t_>  oO ;D
[13:40:15] <Duikb00t_> that worsk
[13:40:25] <taplar> it hides it but it doesn't open again for me
[13:40:25] <Duikb00t_> I cant't type did too much PHP Programming today :D
[13:40:30] <Duikb00t_> hard refresh maybe?
[13:40:47] <taplar> oh, sweet
[13:40:52] <Duikb00t_> Thanks a lot man.
[13:40:53] <taplar> well there ya go
[13:40:56] <Duikb00t_> I also added that else statement fcourse
[13:40:58] <Duikb00t_> thanks a lot!
[13:41:01] <taplar> np
[13:41:04] <Duikb00t_> Thanks(agian) a lot taplar
[14:06:28] <sine0> folks how can I get a unix time stamp from a date like 31/01/2002
[14:06:35] <Duikb00t_> JS?
[14:06:41] <sine0> i have been on the googs but its a bit dry. jquery
[14:07:07] <Duikb00t_> Setup a small example with jsfiddle with that date
[14:07:09] <Duikb00t_> we can built on it
[14:07:13] <sine0> ok
[14:07:20] <robertmaxrees> sine0 jquery doesn't do dates fwiw :)
[14:07:56] <sine0> I have a user to put in a date and then I need to check if it has been 3 years since that date
[14:08:03] <Duikb00t_> I can suggest you MomentJS sine0
[14:08:15] <robertmaxrees> sine0 are you using a plugin to handle the date input?
[14:08:31] <sine0> robertmaxrees: its wordpress gravity forms so the input is from a datepicker
[14:08:50] <sine0> im hooking into the wordpress form via functions.php so I want to try and keep it in the format
[14:09:18] <robertmaxrees> and you're trying to validate client-side, yeah?
[14:09:26] <moveax> well moment js could validate that client side, but you should validate it server side anyway
[14:09:33] <taplar> ^
[14:09:39] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^
[14:09:40] <moveax> js validation is just sugar for the UI
[14:09:51] <sine0> yes i know folks. its not mission critical
[14:10:07] <moveax> yeah, but we can never know if you know that :*
[14:10:08] <sine0> it just means they have to add some additional data. at teh moment they are skipping it
[14:10:54] <robertmaxrees> skipping it or putting in an invalid date range?
[14:11:00] <sine0> there is not a solution built into the gravity forms to check if a date is more than 3 years from now. there is a paid plugin that has that feature but I want to do it myself.
[14:11:09] <sine0> back to the matter at hand anyway
[14:11:26] <taplar> the issue is with the 'now'
[14:11:35] <sine0> I will jsfiddle. i was having a play before i left work
[14:11:37] <taplar> which is what moment helps with, as javascript dates are dependent upon the user time
[14:12:12] <taplar> but aside from that, if you can get the correct now, it's not hard to compare dates
[14:12:23] <robertmaxrees> especially with moment
[14:12:51] <sine0> ok well i guess i could enque momentjs
[14:13:02] <sine0> but it seems like i was nearly there!
[14:13:05] <sine0> let me get the code
[14:31:46] <taplar> from the garage
[14:32:08] * taplar decides it's time for coffee
[14:32:09] <robertmaxrees> in my other house across town
[14:35:28] <sine0> oh sorry
[14:35:30] <sine0> im on one
[14:37:03] <sine0> im using getTime();
[14:37:25] <sine0> from new Date() and new Date(01/08/2015)
[14:37:43] <sine0> then subtract one from the other
[14:39:12] <taplar> and how important is the accuracy of this check?
[14:42:28] <sine0> its not major accuracy needed
[14:42:46] <taplar> then that should work fine
[14:42:58] <taplar> just be aware that a user can change their system clock and mess with the results
[14:45:02] <sine0> taplar: I understand as was said this is not mission critical just filling in a gap. if it was mission critical I would not use gravity forms
[15:03:38] <sine0> var NewFormedDate = splitDate[1] + "/" + splitDate[0] + "/" splitDate[2];
[15:03:41] <sine0> whats wrong with taht
[15:03:53] <sine0> ahh
[15:03:54] <sine0> +
[15:07:04] <MikeD_> it's also "wrong" in that it's not a date, it's a string... so you won't be able to use it for anything other than a display... but w/e
[15:11:26] <pastebin> Hi! I want to make it so if you press a checkbox it would show some text inside a specific div. I want multiple checkboxes, and if you press each of these, they add to the text inside that div.
[15:11:32] <pastebin> What would be my approach to that?
[15:12:13] <taplar> either a click or change handler on the checkboxes
[15:19:02] <pastebin> https://jsfiddle.net/1b1dnocn/3/
[15:19:18] <pastebin> If i check Volvo, i want the Audi to hide, and so on - would that be possible?
[15:19:32] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/c4t47byr/
[15:20:19] <pastebin> Super taplar! Is it possible to do that with radio? I want to limit the possibility to select wrong! :)
[15:20:28] <taplar> sure
[15:20:34] <taplar> one sec
[15:23:04] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/c4t47byr/1/
[15:23:31] <pastebin> That's fantastic! Thank you so much @taplar for your help! Saved me hours xD
[15:33:26] <sine0> I think I have done it guys, its messy but im learning and it work, thats what its all about right ? https://codepaste.net/d2ez2m
[15:44:12] <taplar> you should use change there instead of blur
[15:44:44] <taplar> you really only want to do your logic if the input changed.  if the user clicked on the input and then clicked off, no reason to do work
[15:46:08] <taplar> also inside that handler when you get the mdeDate, that could just be this.value or e.target.value
[15:47:03] <taplar> also from a readability standpoint, i would highly encourage you to name your variable more clearly as to reflect what they are.
[15:47:15] <taplar> for instance on it's own, this makes no sense: var r = (d - t);
[15:47:47] <taplar> if you use a minimize and uglify your code for production use, which you should, the size of your variable names doesn't matter.
[15:51:25] <sine0> oh ok cool thanks for the tips
[15:52:16] <hellyeah> is this correct way? http://dpaste.com/2CZEXKS
[15:52:59] <taplar> take off the data: if you aren't giving it data and 'datatype' should be 'dataType'
[15:53:30] <taplar> other than that, looks fine, save for the return from the success method
[15:55:10] <hellyeah> save for the return from success metod you mean remove it?
[15:55:21] <hellyeah> yo
[15:55:24] <hellyeah> ops
[15:55:54] <taplar> yeah, ajax is asynchronous.  return there doesn't make sense
[15:56:34] <hellyeah> btw
[15:56:39] <hellyeah> finally i got the job
[15:57:27] <taplar> i saw in the logs.  congrats
[15:57:51] <hellyeah> which logo?
[15:57:55] <taplar> chat logs
[15:58:06] <hellyeah> ah
[15:58:16] <hellyeah> i am sorry to misread
[15:58:17] <taplar> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/
[15:59:08] <hellyeah> how goes?
[15:59:21] <taplar> same as always, :)
[15:59:27] <taplar> just colder
[16:00:20] <VX> how can i say all that has the data item,  jQuery( "[data-part='*']" )
[16:00:40] <taplar> regardless of value?
[16:00:44] <VX> yeah
[16:00:48] <taplar> [data-part]
[16:01:09] <taplar> i'd highly suggest reducing the scope you perform that on though
[16:07:30] <hellyeah> yeahaahahahahhahahaa
[16:07:44] <taplar> ?
[16:07:52] <hellyeah> this is kinda of exaggeration isnt it?
[16:07:52] <hellyeah> .D
[16:08:11] <taplar> i'm not sure what you are referring to
[16:08:24] <hellyeah> my reaction
[16:08:31] <hellyeah> i am referring to my reaction
[16:08:36] <hellyeah> anyway nevermind
[16:08:47] <taplar> lol
[16:08:56] <hellyeah> you know i really appreciate you
[16:09:08] <taplar> you're not gonna kiss me are you?
[16:09:17] <hellyeah> and i appreciate robertmaxrees  :D
[16:09:23] <taplar> you can kiss robert
[16:09:30] <hellyeah> taplar:  i am straight
[16:09:31] <hellyeah> .D
[16:09:47] <hellyeah> taplar:  you really did teach me
[16:10:01] <hellyeah> i mean the ability i have today thanks to you
[16:10:11] <taplar> where'd you get a job at?
[16:10:17] <taplar> or what are you doing now?
[16:11:48] <hellyeah> Istanbul
[16:11:54] <hellyeah> i am doing backend and frontend
[16:12:13] <hellyeah> the company i work for, offer a service for intensive care unit
[16:12:24] <taplar> cool
[16:12:25] <hellyeah> we have a software called eclinics
[16:12:40] <hellyeah> we are monitoring and many other things about hospital
[16:12:53] <taplar> lots of security concerns there
[16:12:55] <hellyeah> the company is still new
[16:13:13] <hellyeah> data security is important yes,
[16:13:29] <hellyeah> 4this is not the only case may be
[16:14:07] <hellyeah> once i offered them restrict the access to the software that is relied on web
[16:14:33] <hellyeah> to spesific ips also i offered to do 2 factor authentication
[16:14:38] <hellyeah> like gmail do
[16:14:53] <hellyeah> also server side validation and client side validation
[16:15:04] <hellyeah> we need to think about sql injection and xss attack
[16:15:15] <hellyeah> is there other thing i need to think about?
[16:15:26] <taplar> secure data transfer
[16:15:53] <taplar> user/role/function level security
[16:16:05] <taplar> data encryption
[16:16:08] <taplar> lots of things
[16:16:22] <hellyeah> well
[16:16:24] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:16:35] <hellyeah> we are getting data from hospital devices
[16:16:57] <hellyeah> to the compputer and we are connection that computer to parse the data
[16:17:13] <hellyeah> which one are you talking about specifically?
[16:17:20] <hellyeah> first one or second one
[16:17:24] <taplar> is your software onsite?
[16:17:45] <hellyeah> you can access if what you meant
[16:18:00] <taplar> can you access it offsite?
[16:18:16] <hellyeah> actually i dont know what onsite and offsite mean
[16:18:29] <hellyeah> i understand like everyone can access onsite web site
[16:18:34] <hellyeah> is that correct?
[16:18:35] <taplar> at the physical location the data originates from is "onsite"
[16:18:52] <taplar> if you are not at that location and can get to the data through the internet, that is "off site"
[16:18:54] <hellyeah> ah
[16:19:02] <hellyeah> ah
[16:19:07] <hellyeah> this is off site than
[16:19:11] <hellyeah> then*
[16:19:18] <taplar> then at minimum you will want to transfer the data over https
[16:20:14] <taplar> hopefully that's already being done
[16:20:20] <hellyeah> you mean the link you get data from must be https right
[16:20:44] <taplar> the connection from your pc through the internet to their information should be https
[16:20:54] <taplar> and even on site, the connections should be https
[16:21:16] <taplar> a man in the middle attack can happen off or on site
[16:21:57] <hellyeah> it seems software run over https
[16:23:10] <taplar> how long do sessions last?
[16:24:09] <hellyeah> well
[16:24:14] <hellyeah> i dont know that one
[16:24:38] <hellyeah> probably default value that is set by developer of asp.net
[16:24:57] <hellyeah> i will ask tomorrow about that
[16:25:33] <hellyeah> user/function/role security
[16:25:42] <hellyeah> you mean like admin - user thing right
[16:26:30] <taplar> not just admin
[16:26:32] <taplar> all users
[16:27:41] <taplar> from a security standpoint, you want to make sure users only have access to the things they should have access to
[16:28:07] <taplar> you can give users roles.  and roles are tied to what a user can do
[16:28:27] <taplar> like wise, functions can check user roles to verify that they can perform the specific operation
[16:28:52] <taplar> because maybe you forgot to restrict a page to a user that shouldn't be there
[16:29:27] <taplar> if they try to do something they shouldn't be able to do, you should stop them, and log it so you become aware of it and fix the issue of them having access in the first place
[16:29:31] <hellyeah> actually the best thing you can do i assume is to state user with some kind of flag in db
[16:29:39] <hellyeah> and point them to seperate page
[16:30:41] <taplar> how familiar are you with unix permissions?
[16:31:38] <hellyeah> i know enough
[16:31:40] <taplar> that's a good example of what i'm talking about with user/role/function level security
[16:31:54] <hellyeah> i am using asp.net
[16:31:58] <hellyeah> ah
[16:32:01] <hellyeah> yeah sure
[16:32:17] <hellyeah> you dont want normal user do rm -f ./
[16:32:34] <taplar> simply by being a user, it knows you have access to things you own.
[16:32:51] <taplar> other things, maybe you can't do anything with them unless you are in a group.  aka, a role
[16:33:08] <hellyeah> yeah i understand
[16:33:19] <taplar> but even then, specific actions (aka functions) like read/write/delete are even more granularly granted
[16:34:11] <taplar> guaranteeing that, if used correctly, only the people who should access things access them, and only the actions they can do can be taken
[16:35:14] <taplar> i know a lot of apps will have security over who can access pages, but then don't over the actions originating from that page
[16:35:25] <taplar> because they assume that if a user can't access the page, they can't guess at the action
[16:35:49] <hellyeah> yeh
[16:35:51] <taplar> which, depending upon the importance of the data may not be very critical.  but for medical information, ;)
[16:36:17] <hellyeah> medical informatin is always critical
[16:37:07] <robertmaxrees> even better - sometimes applications will simply hide/show links, but if you have the url to a page you can still access it.
[16:41:47] <taplar> seen those too
[16:42:55] <hellyeah> really
[16:42:59] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:43:14] <robertmaxrees> which is gross and funny all at once.
[16:43:40] <taplar> especially if you have an app where a person can go from higher permissions to lower permissions, but they have bookmarks
[16:48:22] <hellyeah> that is stupid
[16:48:36] <taplar> out of site, out of mid
[16:48:43] <taplar> security through obscurity
[16:48:44] <hellyeah> i mean the thing robertmaxrees is stupid
[16:49:17] <hellyeah> security through obscurity sounds like catchy phrases
[16:49:24] <hellyeah> pharase*
[16:49:25] <taplar> it's also bad practice
[16:49:41] <taplar> it's exactly what robert was talking about
[16:49:49] <hellyeah> you cannot fill every hole right
[16:49:56] <taplar> that's a big hole

[16:53:19] <grapheti> what a garb lang
[16:53:27] <Guest8372> stop screwing around
[16:53:39] <taplar> try ##javascript
[16:53:41] <grapheti> You're kind of off-topic.
[16:56:49] <hellyeah> i forgot small detail
[16:56:52] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:56:54] <robertmaxrees> this channel.
[16:56:58] <grapheti> hehe
[16:57:05] <hellyeah> this is how we create element right var $th = $('<th>');
[16:57:12] <taplar> one way, sure
[16:57:21] <hellyeah> other way?
[16:57:30] <taplar> document.createElement('div')
[16:57:40] <hellyeah> yeah thats vanilla js
[16:57:54] <robertmaxrees> i prefer cinnamon js
[16:57:54] <hellyeah> remember that one .D
[16:58:04] <hellyeah> i dont know what that is
[16:58:10] <hellyeah> cinnamon is DE afaik
[16:58:12] <robertmaxrees> (it's a joke)
[16:58:16] <taplar> now i really want some swirrel icecream
[16:58:17] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:58:25] <hellyeah> yeah
[16:58:31] <hellyeah> i found what i want to eat
[16:58:31] <robertmaxrees> vanilla is a flavor.  cinnamon is a flavor.
[16:58:35] <hellyeah> ice cream
[16:58:36] <hellyeah> haahaha
[16:58:36] <robertmaxrees> ~*puns*~
[16:58:54] <grapheti> cinnabuns.js
[16:58:57] <taplar> come on robert, you know me.  i don't know what a pun is
[16:59:10] <robertmaxrees> taplar doesn't know works.
[16:59:11] <Guest8372> damn u guis
[16:59:15] <grapheti> he's a god-damn cyborg
[16:59:20] <robertmaxrees> you see, condescension is talking down to somebody.
[16:59:31] <robertmaxrees> Guest8372 you'll have a ton more luck in ##javascript :)
[16:59:37] <grapheti> LOL
[16:59:48] <grapheti> like 1000x times worse
[16:59:55] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:59:59] <taplar> ?
[17:00:09] <robertmaxrees> that joke really only works in person :(f
[17:01:17] <taplar> i'm lost.  i was thinking graph just said javascript is worse
[17:01:58] <taplar> don't make the rooms fight graph.  think of the children!
[17:02:06] <grapheti> It's worse in they argue over trivial things.
[17:02:11] <grapheti> Just like node.js does
[17:02:16] <grapheti> It's funny actually.
[17:02:30] <robertmaxrees> s'why i usually avoid talking in there.
[17:02:51] <grapheti> THE KIDS!
[17:03:07] <taplar> well obviously javascript is mouthy and opinionated.  they doubled up on the ##
[17:03:14] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[17:03:14] <grapheti> lol
[17:04:30] <grapheti> ASI argument is prolly my fav
[17:04:47] * taplar googles
[17:05:00] <robertmaxrees> automatic semicolon insertion
[17:05:01] <grapheti> Automatic Semicolon Insertion
[17:05:06] <robertmaxrees> got'em
[17:05:08] <grapheti> hehe
[17:06:06] <grapheti> You know it. It just has a name for it.
[17:06:07] <grapheti> Blah.
[17:06:57] <grapheti> They can't seem to wrap their heads around just use a linter and whatever the team decides. They insist you MUST use semicolons!
[17:07:02] <grapheti> IT'S THE LAW!
[17:07:17] <taplar> mmm
[17:07:22] <grapheti> node anyway
[17:07:29] <taplar> i'll admin, i'm in the ; camp
[17:07:32] <taplar> *admit
[17:07:32] <grapheti> well, some in node*
[17:07:40] <grapheti> hehe
[17:07:48] <grapheti> I'm not one for strong opinions.
[17:07:52] <robertmaxrees> i remember a while ago ##javascript was filled with people who insisted you never use semicolons.
[17:08:00] <grapheti> lmao
[17:08:20] <robertmaxrees> like, if you used semicolons they'd lose their collective minds
[17:08:42] <taplar> some times I'll see a {} and the statement inside it doesn't have a ; at the end.  And i -know- that's valid.  But it still hurts my ocd.
[17:08:49] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[17:08:51] <grapheti> it's just shit like that that makes you not want to go to any of those channels
[17:09:02] <grapheti> it's just a bunch of pointless arguments
[17:09:08] <grapheti> entertaining tho
[17:09:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[17:09:16] <robertmaxrees> every codebase is different.
[17:09:20] <grapheti> ^
[17:10:07] <grapheti> taplar, that's understandable, but they are intentionally trying to tell everyone to not use them
[17:10:15] <grapheti> that's bad to me
[17:10:20] <taplar> oh sure
[17:10:23] <grapheti> People should use what they want.
[17:10:37] <grapheti> as long as they know what errors they will have etc
[17:11:05] <grapheti> or use them*
[17:11:49] <grapheti> that's what I call a lil indoctrination
[17:12:56] <grapheti> oh, well, we'll all prolly be writing wasm soon
[17:13:00] <grapheti> so w/e
[17:13:24] <grapheti> well converting to it
[17:13:30] <taplar> i prever the org version of asm
[17:13:40] <taplar> *prefer
[17:14:34] <taplar> no?  *shrug*
[17:19:30] <grapheti> lol
[17:25:52] <taplar> off topic, so wasm is a compiled version of C/C++?
[17:26:34] <robertmaxrees> it's a compile target
[17:27:39] <taplar> so does that mean there is the possibility of seeing a resurgence of pointer errors? :)
[17:27:46] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[17:27:50] <robertmaxrees> http://webassembly.org/
[17:28:03] <hellyeah> let me ask that
[17:28:08] <taplar> looking at their faq page now
[17:28:16] <hellyeah> there is prependTo and AppendTo
[17:28:29] <hellyeah> but there is no middleTo()
[17:28:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:28:47] <hellyeah> i have a table which has 3 columns first place
[17:29:01] <hellyeah> i added header to the table with prepend
[17:29:15] <hellyeah> and i want to add another thing as second header
[17:29:22] <hellyeah> any suggestion
[17:29:26] <hellyeah> hmm
[17:29:34] <hellyeah> i guess i fount the solution
[17:29:46] <hellyeah> i can add last header first
[17:29:59] <taplar> just insert the second one after the first one
[17:30:56] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/after/
[17:32:48] <hellyeah> i have this piece of code http://dpaste.com/152T4Z0
[17:33:19] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/insertafter/
[17:33:20] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:34:40] <taplar> does $headtr have any th in it at the start of that logic?
[17:41:54] * taplar taps the mic
[17:43:43] <robertmaxrees> welp
[17:43:55] <pastebin> How would i approach this? https://imgur.com/a/UgNNu
[17:44:14] <taplar> palms out, let it sniff you first
[17:45:49] <robertmaxrees> pastebin you'll need to find a way to store relationships between various radios.
[17:47:09] <taplar> are the model radio's re-generated when you change the brand?
[17:47:35] <grapheti> wasm would allow you to write javascript in pretty much any language and it's faster than regular JS because it's at that lower-level assembly lang
[17:47:44] <taplar> and, side note, i feel like these should be dropdowns rather than radios
[17:47:45] <grapheti> I believe that's the goal anyway
[17:48:06] <grapheti> if you were to write in ASP.NET C# then you could write C# and covert it to wasm js
[17:48:07] <pastebin> No, they are all static.
[17:48:27] <pastebin> Could be Drop downs i guess
[17:48:29] <robertmaxrees> grapheti it's not js
[17:48:29] <taplar> so if I select Volvo the Audi ones are still visible?
[17:48:41] <robertmaxrees> asm was a js subset.  wasm wasn't.
[17:48:47] <grapheti> ahhh
[17:48:54] <robertmaxrees> err, *is and *isn't
[17:48:57] <grapheti> I gotcha
[17:49:09] <grapheti> My misunderstanding.
[17:51:04] <pastebin> Yes. That's what i did bad on the screenshot.
[17:51:05] <pastebin> https://imgur.com/a/5B6rF
[17:51:40] <taplar> yeah, i'd definitely use a dropdown, from a ux pov.
[17:52:05] <taplar> and only provide the options that are valid
[17:52:51] <taplar> model is a pretty straight forward filter if you used a data field for the brand
[17:53:36] <taplar> size could probably also be a data field relation, but it'd be an array value most likely
[17:55:17] <taplar> you could also put a data field for color on the model
[17:56:44] <taplar> clear as mud?
[17:57:22] <pastebin> https://imgur.com/a/AI262
[17:58:00] <taplar> you get what i was alluding to with the data fields though?
[18:02:50] <hellyeah> hey,

[18:04:08] <hellyeah> really long one
[18:04:14] <hellyeah> i just want to add to the table
[18:04:24] <pastebin> https://jsfiddle.net/y4vkheg7/
[18:04:29] <hellyeah> is it nderstandable?
[18:04:31] <pastebin> Something like that taplar?
[18:04:38] <pastebin> Not using data tho?
[18:04:57] <Guest8372> go away hellyeah
[18:05:34] <Guest8372> ur messing up my code
[18:05:35] <hellyeah> taplar:  any advice?
[18:05:44] <taplar> everyone is welcome to ask jQuery questions Guest8372
[18:05:55] <Guest8372> well
[18:06:09] <hellyeah> ü
[18:06:13] <hellyeah> ops
[18:06:19] <taplar> hellyeah: from your paste i don't understand what your issue is
[18:06:39] <hellyeah> sec
[18:10:58] <pastebin> Hmm, if i have a spacing in the option, how would i do that in this field? Audi: ["A4", "A5"], like Custom Paint: ["Red", "Blue"],
[18:13:27] <taplar> pastebin: https://jsfiddle.net/y4vkheg7/1/
[18:13:35] <taplar> the start of what i was suggesting with data fields
[18:13:42] <hellyeah> taplar:  i cannot get it working but
[18:13:50] <hellyeah> my purpose is construct a table
[18:14:11] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/o7tzygmf/
[18:14:23] <hellyeah> replace everything to first column
[18:14:29] <hellyeah> this is the problem
[18:15:17] <taplar> why are you doing this with javascript?
[18:15:55] <hellyeah> because it is object
[18:16:20] <taplar> do you get this data with ajax or something?
[18:16:59] <hellyeah> i have to create                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
[18:17:02] <hellyeah> ops
[18:17:04] <hellyeah> sorry
[18:17:07] <hellyeah> with ajax yes
[18:17:20] <taplar> does this table already exist on the page on page load?
[18:17:33] <hellyeah> yes
[18:17:47] <taplar> and will the table ever hold any other information, other than what you are inserting into it?
[18:18:04] <hellyeah> <table><thead><thead><tbody></body></table> exist with some colummns
[18:18:16] <hellyeah> yes
[18:18:21] <hellyeah> three buttons
[18:18:27] <hellyeah> edit, delete, approve
[18:18:33] <taplar> will the headers ever change?
[18:18:49] <hellyeah> no
[18:19:00] <taplar> so why are you building the header dynamically?
[18:19:10] <hellyeah> good question
[18:19:27] <hellyeah> thats wrong i am confused yeah
[18:19:30] <hellyeah> let me fix that
[18:20:47] <taplar> then as far as building the body into rows, you are taking a list of objects, and for each object you want to translate it into a row, correct?
[18:25:15] <Guest8372> hellyeah: stop confusing us
[18:25:15] <catbadger> hullo!
[18:25:44] <taplar> bonjour
[18:25:51] <darkhanb> How come this does not work: https://dpaste.de/hbSQ/raw
[18:25:55] <catbadger> hahaha no
[18:26:09] <hellyeah> okey
[18:26:14] <hellyeah> i fixed that
[18:26:28] <hellyeah> taplar:  any other advice
[18:26:35] <catbadger> taplar's advice is gold
[18:26:42] <taplar> see my comment about the building of the body?
[18:27:04] <hellyeah> taplar:  yes
[18:27:12] <darkhanb> I'm trying to jQuery(document).off("click", handler); which doesn't unbinds it
[18:27:18] <hellyeah> exactly
[18:27:27] <taplar> so what function exists in javascript/jquery that is related to "translation"?
[18:27:43] <robertmaxrees> darkhanb this._click.bind(this) this is returning a new function
[18:27:48] <robertmaxrees> so the reference is lost.
[18:27:56] <catbadger> taplar $.i18n._()
[18:28:03] <hellyeah> taplar:  any clue?
[18:28:06] <taplar> wut?
[18:28:16] <taplar> remember the map function?
[18:28:21] <hellyeah> yes
[18:28:27] <taplar> what does it do?
[18:28:47] <taplar> oh, lol. catbadger wrong translation, lol
[18:28:56] <catbadger> yeah i know... just being funny
[18:28:56] <hellyeah> iterate the object
[18:29:04] <hellyeah> and return something
[18:29:15] <taplar> sound like what you want to do, eh?
[18:29:29] <hellyeah> you mean iterate object with map and cast it to list or something
[18:29:36] <taplar> iterate the array
[18:29:45] <taplar> create row from each object
[18:29:57] <taplar> append them all to the body at the end
[18:30:03] <hellyeah> create a row
[18:30:05] <hellyeah> hm
[18:30:16] <taplar> forget all that clone(true, true) mess
[18:30:24] <hellyeah> i removed that
[18:31:05] <darkhanb> robertmaxrees I see, thank you very much, this works: https://dpaste.de/AKdJ/raw
[18:31:08] <Guest8372> ok gaize
[18:31:17] <Guest8372> i solved my ko problem
[18:31:21] <robertmaxrees> Guest8372 cool.
[18:31:27] <Guest8372> i knoked it out
[18:31:27] <hellyeah> who cares
[18:31:30] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[18:31:33] <hellyeah> just go away
[18:31:34] <hellyeah> :D
[18:31:35] <Guest8372> no hellyeah u listen here
[18:31:40] <robertmaxrees> alright - drop it.
[18:31:41] <robertmaxrees> thx
[18:31:48] <hellyeah> that was a joke
[18:31:51] <Guest8372> i will drag u around by ur ear
[18:32:01] <taplar> $bodytr.append($.map(vData, function(element){ /* create and return row in here */ }));
[18:32:21] <catbadger> ugh more work showed up in gitlab. back laters
[18:33:27] <taplar> which really that should be $tbody, not $bodytr.
[18:33:39] <robertmaxrees> some confusing var names hahaha
[18:33:43] <taplar> ya
[18:34:44] <Guest8372> is there a .size() for object
[18:34:58] <robertmaxrees> like, for how many nodes you have?
[18:35:05] <robertmaxrees> in a jquery objkect?
[18:35:08] <robertmaxrees> *object
[18:35:12] <robertmaxrees> or something else?
[18:35:22] <Guest8372> no in standard js
[18:35:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:35:38] <robertmaxrees> are you trying toi get the number of properties?
[18:35:50] <taplar> i don't see the size method on the Object.prototype
[18:36:24] <taplar> though now i see it was a question.  *wanders off*
[18:37:16] <robertmaxrees> Guest8372
[18:37:30] <hellyeah> row
[18:37:56] <Guest8372> yes
[18:38:03] <robertmaxrees> Object.keys(foo).length
[18:38:10] <Guest8372> oh yeah
[18:38:16] <Guest8372> i forgot about that trick
[18:38:35] <hellyeah> taplar:  makeArray ?
[18:38:41] <taplar> no
[18:38:49] <taplar> you just make your tr with the tds in it
[18:38:59] <taplar> return the tr at the end of the map function
[18:39:34] <Guest8372> what is hellyeah doing
[18:39:43] <robertmaxrees> trying to get help.
[18:39:44] <taplar> dynamically populating a table
[18:40:07] <Guest8372> jeez
[18:40:09] <hellyeah> i understand i will construct row
[18:40:16] <hellyeah> from object
[18:40:31] <hellyeah> and i will add this row to the tr one by one
[18:40:36] <hellyeah> is that correct?
[18:40:43] <taplar> you lost me on that last part
[18:40:48] <Guest8372> thats a bit ineficient
[18:40:51] <Guest8372> but ok
[18:41:05] <hellyeah> Guest8372:  pls contribute
[18:41:06] <taplar> literally this with the inner most part filled out: $bodytr.append($.map(vData, function(element){ /* create and return row in here */ }));
[18:41:09] <hellyeah> be constructive
[18:41:41] <hellyeah> return row
[18:43:01] <taplar> questions?
[18:43:14] <hellyeah> you can return in the map
[18:43:19] <hellyeah> return element
[18:43:26] <taplar> you *should* return
[18:43:30] <taplar> that's the point of map
[18:43:36] <hellyeah> yeah thats the issue of map
[18:43:41] <hellyeah> returning things
[18:43:50] <taplar> you take in an element, create something new, and return the new thing
[18:43:57] <hellyeah> btw
[18:44:00] <hellyeah> element is a row
[18:44:03] <hellyeah> right
[18:44:07] <taplar> nope
[18:44:10] <hellyeah> vData is the whole object
[18:44:14] <taplar> what is $.map operating on?
[18:44:16] <hellyeah> hmm
[18:44:21] <hellyeah> vData
[18:44:25] <taplar> and what is vData
[18:44:51] <hellyeah> vData is the object was fullfilled with data comes from backend
[18:45:03] <taplar> vData is an array, no?
[18:45:29] <hellyeah> vData is a json object
[18:45:41] <hellyeah> i am not sure let me check
[18:46:31] <taplar> it better be an array.  you were doing a forEach on it originally
[18:46:47] <hellyeah> it is object
[18:47:03] <taplar> put an example of it in a paste
[18:52:16] <hellyeah> taplar:  https://jsfiddle.net/eL6vp3cb/
[18:52:53] <taplar> ok, if it is a single object, then you don't need map there
[18:53:04] <taplar> you just need to create your single row and append it to the body
[18:53:16] <taplar> your ajax is seriously just returning one record?
[18:53:47] <hellyeah> no
[18:53:51] <hellyeah> sorry wait
[18:54:04] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:54:13] <taplar> lol, i have a sinking feeling that your going to tell me you are calling this method in a loop
[18:55:49] <hellyeah> taplar:  https://jsfiddle.net/eL6vp3cb/1/
[18:56:15] <robertmaxrees> that's....
[18:56:16] <robertmaxrees> not an array.
[18:56:18] <taplar> oh no
[18:56:24] <taplar> lol
[18:56:28] <taplar> don't do that dude
[18:56:35] <hellyeah> there is an index
[18:56:43] <taplar> can you change the endpoint that returns this json?
[18:56:43] <hellyeah> and object inside it
[18:56:44] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah that's not an array.
[18:57:09] <hellyeah> how can i change?
[18:57:09] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah that's an object with properties whose names are numbers.
[18:57:13] <robertmaxrees> which is different form an object.
[18:57:21] <hellyeah> hmm
[18:57:26] <robertmaxrees> *array
[18:57:29] <hellyeah> this comes from db
[18:57:41] <hellyeah> i did simple ajax call
[18:57:48] <hellyeah> should i change dataType?
[18:57:51] <taplar> and can you change that ajax call?
[18:57:54] <taplar> err service
[18:57:59] <hellyeah> yeah sure
[18:58:09] <taplar> i highly suggest that you fix this to return a  proper array
[18:58:25] <hellyeah> i dont know how to do it actually
[18:58:34] <hellyeah> ajax call will return array?
[18:58:38] <taplar> no
[18:58:40] <taplar> err, we want it to
[18:58:48] <taplar> not this messed up object structure
[18:58:59] <taplar> [object1, object2]
[18:59:08] <taplar> not {0:object1, 1:object2}
[18:59:46] <hellyeah> c# json thing is problematic then
[19:00:00] <hellyeah> problem is in backend?
[19:00:05] <taplar> with that note i'm going to let others advise you cause my azz is going home.
[19:00:19] <hellyeah> azz?
[19:00:33] <taplar> @$$
[19:00:52] <taplar> lol, don't make it weird
[19:01:04] <taplar> adios!
[19:01:20] <hellyeah> what happened?
[19:01:27] <hellyeah> i dont understand anything
[19:01:41] <robertmaxrees> he just left.
[19:01:47] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  did i do something wrong?
[19:01:56] <robertmaxrees> he just had to go home duder
[19:02:03] <hellyeah> ah ok
[19:02:32] <hellyeah> i really dont know what i should do
[19:02:32] <Guest8372> see wat hapens
[19:02:35] <hellyeah> any advice?
[19:02:53] <robertmaxrees> so where are you stuck?
[19:02:58] <robertmaxrees> with that object return?
[19:03:03] <hellyeah> yeah
[19:03:13] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/eL6vp3cb/1/
[19:03:13] <robertmaxrees> so your C# code is doing something weird.
[19:03:26] <hellyeah> well it is c#
[19:03:32] <robertmaxrees> the data you're getting back - notice how it's {0: foo, 1: bar} ?
[19:03:50] <hellyeah> i really dont know
[19:03:54] <hellyeah> it looks weird
[19:03:59] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:04:02] <robertmaxrees> what about it looks weird?
[19:04:07] <hellyeah> but map can get index parameter
[19:04:20] <robertmaxrees> so you don't want to use map there.
[19:04:25] <robertmaxrees> because you want an arrayu, not an object.
[19:05:04] <robertmaxrees> you need to fix the data format first.
[19:05:18] <hellyeah> so
[19:05:29] <hellyeah> array should come from backend to frontend
[19:05:35] <hellyeah> is that what you are saying
[19:08:11] <hellyeah> anyway damn you c#
[19:08:17] <hellyeah> damn you entity framework
[19:09:38] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  fixed when i removed dataType:json
[19:09:45] <hellyeah> is it okey now {ID: 1, HospID: 123, PID: "123", PatInfoID: 0, BadNumber: null, …}
[19:11:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:11:34] <robertmaxrees> you want an array
[19:11:50] <robertmaxrees> you need toi fix it on the c# side.
[19:15:57] <hellyeah> is the format for communication between backend and frontend json right?
[19:16:07] <robertmaxrees> it is.
[19:16:16] <robertmaxrees> but in this case you're going to have multiple rows at a time, right?
[19:16:27] <hellyeah> yes
[19:16:36] <robertmaxrees> so you want to return a JSON array.
[19:16:42] <robertmaxrees> JSON can be wrapped in []
[19:16:50] <hellyeah> ah
[19:17:02] <hellyeah> jquery makeArray function
[19:17:06] <hellyeah> doesnt it work?
[19:17:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:17:37] <robertmaxrees> so you want to avoid massaging data client-side as much as possible.
[19:17:42] <robertmaxrees> make the server give you the right format instead.
[19:18:49] <hellyeah> okay
[19:19:01] <hellyeah> i am searching the methods
[19:30:34] <Guest8372> umm what does .parent("idname")
[19:30:36] <Guest8372> do
[19:30:52] <Guest8372> seems a bit redundant
[19:36:24] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  i cannot find c# way i am gonna use makeArray can you help me little bit more
[19:36:26] <hellyeah> ?
[19:37:40] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah heh
[19:37:58] <robertmaxrees> Guest8372 you mean .parent('anyselector')?
[19:38:22] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah i can, but it's not a very good idea to do it the way you're doing it.
[19:38:57] <hellyeah> yes
[19:39:01] <hellyeah> i will fix that
[19:39:03] <hellyeah> i promise
[19:39:10] <hellyeah> i have to show this tomorrow
[19:39:21] <hellyeah> but i promise you i find a way
[19:39:30] <robertmaxrees> then go back to what you had before with the weird numeric property names.
[19:39:38] <robertmaxrees> and then use makearray on that.
[19:39:44] <robertmaxrees> it'll be a little less weird that way.
[19:40:05] <hellyeah> i did this var arr = jQuery.makeArray(vData);
[19:40:26] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're getting back that object with the numbered property names like before.
[19:40:40] <robertmaxrees> and then run makeArray against that.
[19:41:21] <hellyeah> sec
[19:43:36] <hellyeah> okey
[19:43:39] <hellyeah> i did that
[19:43:45] <hellyeah> what now?
[19:43:54] <robertmaxrees> you tell me :)
[19:44:20] <robertmaxrees> you have you array now, right?
[19:47:20] <hellyeah> looks like that [0 … 99]
[19:47:39] <robertmaxrees> are you expecting 99 entries?
[19:48:14] <hellyeah> when i expand it {ID: 1, HospID: 123, PID: "123", PatInfoID: 0, BadNumber: null, …}
[19:48:20] <robertmaxrees> show me what you have.
[19:48:39] <hellyeah> totaly entry is 104
[19:48:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:48:53] <robertmaxrees> duder
[19:48:58] <hellyeah> 0-99 100-103
[19:49:00] <robertmaxrees> i can't help you if i don't understand the problem.
[19:49:11] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what you have, what you're expecting, etc.
[19:49:25] <hellyeah> i just try to populate table
[19:49:50] <hellyeah> i have object inside array now
[19:50:05] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[19:50:17] <robertmaxrees> are the objects in the array what you're expecting?
[19:50:35] <hellyeah> yes,
[19:50:40] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[19:50:45] <robertmaxrees> so what next?
[19:51:01] <hellyeah> return that row by row
[19:51:07] <hellyeah> and append it to tbody
[19:51:24] <Guest8372> lol
[19:51:59] <hellyeah> did i say something wrong?
[19:55:58] <hellyeah> hmm
[19:57:31] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah so do that?
[19:58:28] <robertmaxrees> or have that map return a string of all the rows and then append that string to tbody
[19:58:33] <hellyeah> '<tr><td>' + element + '</td></td>'
[19:58:48] <robertmaxrees> you sure that'll give you what you want?
[19:58:55] <robertmaxrees> is element the right thing there?
[19:59:20] <hellyeah> actually no
[19:59:26] <hellyeah> hmm
[19:59:42] <robertmaxrees> so element is probably the object, right?
[19:59:42] <hellyeah> because element is all data inside the row
[19:59:46] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:59:47] <hellyeah> yes
[19:59:56] <robertmaxrees> so you'll need to access all the properties and stuff.
[19:59:56] <hellyeah> i guess i need second map
[20:00:00] <robertmaxrees> and format it correctly.
[20:00:19] <hellyeah> right
[20:00:22] <hellyeah> let me see smt
[20:00:39] <hellyeah> element.blah
[20:00:46] <hellyeah> for example
[20:00:51] <robertmaxrees> sure
[20:01:24] <hellyeah> YES
[20:01:45] <hellyeah> good
