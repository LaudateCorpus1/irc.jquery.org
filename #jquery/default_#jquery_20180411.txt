[02:22:00] <jak2000> Cork friend are you there?
[02:22:08] <jak2000> any link for read more about callbacks?
[02:22:32] <Cork> jak2000: callbacks is just a function you store in a variable and call from somewhere
[02:23:17] <Cork> there is also $.Callbacks that you might want to have a look at
[02:23:24] <jak2000> ok
[02:23:30] <jak2000> inlpase of use asynf:false
[02:23:32] <jak2000> right?
[02:23:46] <Cork> async: false has nothing to do with it
[02:24:01] <jak2000> you say its depreceated...
[02:24:18] <Cork> ya, it is
[02:24:31] <Cork> but it still doesn't have anything to do with callbacks
[02:24:32] <jak2000> you recommend me use callbacks
[02:24:41] <jak2000> or what you recommend to me
[02:24:42] <Cork> sure, but not inplace of async: false
[02:24:51] <jak2000> replace async:false?
[02:24:51] <Cork> it was how i recommended you to solve the problem you had
[02:25:09] <Cork> forget about async: false
[02:25:16] <Cork> if you have it in your code remove it
[02:25:29] <jak2000> yes remove
[02:25:35] <jak2000> but the process not work :(
[02:25:57] <Cork> ya, cause you don't provide a way to the code to wait until the ajax call is done
[02:26:23] <jak2000> understand
[02:27:16] <jak2000> but wich link you recommend me for learn?
[02:29:16] <Cork> jak2000: there isn't that much to learn
[02:29:24] <Cork> it can be done as simply as https://jsfiddle.net/skjcccvw/1/
[02:29:32] <Cork> the setTimeout is to simulate the ajax call
[02:30:38] <Cork> if you want a permanent callback you prob want to store it in a $().data() reference
[02:30:58] <jak2000> ok
[02:31:03] <jak2000> thx
[02:31:07] <Cork> but it really just is about storing a function as a value and having access to that
[02:32:38] <Cork> $('button').data('ajax', function() {}) and then $(this).data('ajax')(); is another solution (don't forget to store this in a different variable if you want to use it in second level callbacks
[02:32:44] <Cork> )
[02:34:22] <jak2000> ok, reading
[02:34:26] <jak2000> more about
[02:34:27] <jak2000> thanks
[02:34:30] <jak2000> cork for your time
[03:38:28] <preference> hi guys, at what point should i start worrying about having too much js/jquery/CSS slowing down the page? is it worth worrying about 200-300 lines? or is it entirely dependent on the nature of the code (e.g. intensive processes) and the number of lines is pretty inconsequential in and of itself?
[03:39:45] <Cork> preference: 3 lines of code have have much more effect then 1000 lines
[03:39:48] <Cork> it matters what they do
[03:41:11] <preference> Cork: right, but would having 1000 lines that don't really do much (for example just styling) make an impact on load time?
[03:44:24] <Cork> preference: depends, check the performance tab in your browser and the network tab (for load time)
[04:28:18] <ledtc> Q: Hey could some one make a short sniper demonstrating how to connect a <button></button> to trigger a function ? I'm having trouble with the documentation
[04:30:15] <Woet> ledtc: what have you tried so far?
[04:30:26] <ledtc> Woet, $(".buttonPostOnClick").click(function() {
[04:30:47] <ledtc> quick class and a click function should do it i thougt but nope
[04:31:35] <Woet> ledtc: www.jsfiddle.net please
[04:31:49] <Woet> because that code looks fine
[04:32:02] <Cork> ledtc: you've most likely missed the ready function wrapper
[04:32:49] <Cork> ledtc: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery3
[04:33:12] <Woet> or the class doesn't exist, or it'll work fine on jsfiddle because the issue is elsewhere, or the issue is in the actual callback
[04:33:13] <Woet> etc
[04:33:22] <preference> Cork: if i wanted to dynamically scale a grid of containers, and at certain widths stop reducing size and instead start putting them in columns etc., what would be most efficient route? would it be flexbox? grid? would you recommend a plugin?
[04:33:44] <Cork> preference: @media
[04:33:47] <Cork> (in css)
[04:34:07] <preference> will that take care of the container scaling?
[04:34:12] <preference> i've used @media before
[04:34:23] <Cork> preference: not sure what you mean by "container scaling"
[04:34:45] <preference> just changing the heights and widths of the containers
[04:34:53] <preference> and the widths between them being proportionate
[04:35:05] <Cork> sure you can have @media rules controlling the size of elements
[04:35:32] <ledtc> https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/96368/
[04:35:40] <ledtc> Woet, Cork  ^
[04:35:48] <Cork> 96 368 ? :D
[04:36:04] <Uhkis_> ledtc: remove the dot from the classname in html
[04:36:13] <ledtc> ....
[04:36:20] <preference> haha
[04:36:25] <Uhkis_> Cork: that's the jquery template in jsfiddle :P
[04:36:58] <Cork> ah
[04:37:18] <ledtc> Uhkis, come again ?
[04:37:30] <Woet> ledtc: class names dont have dots.
[04:37:37] <Woet> ledtc: the "." in jQuery indicates clas
[04:37:38] <Woet> class *
[04:37:48] <Woet> ledtc: just like # indicates ID
[04:37:50] <Woet> ledtc: it's not an actual part of the class/ID name
[04:37:55] <Cork> ledtc: the dot in selectors is to match the class attribute, if you have a dot in the class name you would have to have .. in the selector
[04:38:01] <Cork> ledtc: so remove the extra dot
[04:38:01] <Woet> .foo = class="foo"
[04:38:03] <ledtc> Woet, but the exemples all use # .
[04:38:04] <Woet> #bar = id="bar"
[04:38:11] <Woet> ledtc: yes, so read what I said.
[04:38:34] <preference> ledtc: if you name your class .button, then your selector will have to be ..button
[04:38:44] <preference> so just skip out the . in the class name
[04:38:51] <Woet> does that even work?
[04:38:54] <ledtc> in the HTML right
[04:38:57] <preference> yes
[04:38:58] <Uhkis> more like \\..button  :D
[04:39:06] <ledtc> i check my script tags in the html not the html in the html
[04:39:08] <Cork> well no but .\\.button
[04:39:13] <Woet> preference: doesn't look like it
[04:39:17] <preference> Woet: i meant ledtc
[04:39:25] <preference> idk if it works or not, need an escape character like Cork  said i guess
[04:39:25] <Woet> ok
[04:39:29] <Uhkis> Cork: something awful in any case :D
[04:39:49] <preference> ledtc: ?
[04:40:11] <ledtc> It works, thanks guys! :)
[04:40:12] <Cork> i love writing those horrible selectors as classes and ids to show how weird the css selector restrictions (or lack there of) are
[04:40:56] <Woet> ledtc: so now it's time to read up on selectors
[04:41:07] <Uhkis> i recall some very nasty fiddle of  yours with a bunch of those
[04:41:28] <Uhkis> it was like seeing regex for the first time
[04:41:34] <ledtc> Woet, selectors ? I dont have the "." in other parts of my  html
[04:41:47] <Cork> Uhkis: yup :D
[04:42:14] <Woet> ledtc: https://api.jquery.com/class-selector/ https://api.jquery.com/id-selector/
[04:42:30] <preference> ledtc: he means that you need to understand how selection of elements, classes, and ids work in jquery
[04:42:42] <ledtc> hmm okey
[04:42:58] <preference> just try to avoid putting punctuation in your classes and ids
[04:43:17] <preference> ledtc: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp
[04:43:24] <Cork> ugg no
[04:43:30] <Cork> don't point ppl to w3scools...
[04:43:47] <preference> looking at that explained it way faster than any other website i found
[04:43:54] <preference> the jquery tutorial pages are sometimes great and sometimes awful
[04:44:04] <Cork> preference, ledtc: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors
[04:44:59] <Cork> preference: w3schools is a pile of dogshit
[04:45:15] <preference> Cork: when someone linked me that before, it only confused me because i was too dumb to understand the examples
[04:45:29] <Uhkis> preference: mdn is everyones preference! :D
[04:45:35] <Cork> its only redeeming factor is that its been around since ~1997
[04:46:05] <preference> newbies don't have a preference, we just want the easiest, simplest to understand stuff, even if it's technically incorrect
[04:46:15] <preference> if it broadly works, the exceptions can be figured out later
[04:46:35] <Uhkis> that's one destructive attitude
[04:46:36] <Cork> preference: the big difference with mdn is that it is a wiki and is actively updated by a lot of big contributors (including microsoft and google)
[04:46:53] <Cork> and offcourse mozilla (as it is mozilla developer network)
[04:47:18] <preference> Uhkis: idk, it's not like any newbies are head of the web dev at microsoft
[04:47:25] <preference> Cork: i believe you
[04:47:33] <preference> looking at the mozilla page now, it's way more informative for me
[04:48:23] <preference> but at first, it just made no sense to me, whereas w3's try mode basically gave me an instant response
[04:48:26] <preference> https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/trysel.asp
[04:48:29] <preference> this is literally so useful
[04:48:56] <Cork> preference: the problem with w3scools is that it has tended to teach old known to be broken solutions many many years after a better solution has been found
[04:49:49] <Cork> it recomended document.all instead of document.querySelectorAll even after microsoft dropped it -_-'
[04:50:05] <Cork> (and no other browser has ever supported it)
[04:50:11] <preference> Cork: i'm not disputing that, you're clearly far more knowledgeable in this area than me. all i can tell you is that when it came to the ultra-basics, literally stuff like "what is a <div>", "what attributes can <p> have", "what does inline styling mean", w3 was far more useful
[04:50:38] <Cork> ... you're kinda missing the point
[04:51:03] <Cork> when you point someone learning to a source known to have a lot of problems with what it teaches, you set them up for a hard time
[04:51:32] <Cork> cause they will then have to learn and then unlearn to learn the correct solution
[04:51:42] <preference> i get it
[04:52:32] <preference> for anything more complex, there are better places to go e.g. moz
[04:52:48] <Cork> and for simpler it is better to keep away too
[04:53:10] <Cork> basically make -site:www.w3schools.com in your searches
[04:53:45] <preference> *shrugs*
[04:58:09] <Cork> ah there it is :)
[04:58:11] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/w3qRm/2/
[04:58:30] <preference> what the hell is this
[04:58:42] <Cork> css selector escape hell :D
[04:59:06] <Cork> note you should absolutely never do this in a real project ^^'
[04:59:17] <Uhkis> no Cork nooooo
[04:59:25] <Cork> but #a\ b\ c\ \.d\ \>\ div > .v > div > #div\ \>\ \.h is a valid selector
[04:59:44] <Cork> completely and utterly unreadable... but valid
[05:00:54] <preference> but... why?
[05:01:33] <Uhkis> Cork is a bit nuts :)
[05:01:57] <Cork> the reason for me finding just how loose the restrictions are was cause i had to help someone fix a selector breaking on selecting an id with dots and # in them
[05:02:22] <Cork> my first gut reaction was "that isn't a valid id" from old html 3 days
[05:03:01] <Cork> and then i looked in living html and... its only restriction are that they can't be blank
[05:03:36] <Cork> then i looked into just how far you could push it and wrote that fiddle
[05:03:49] <Cork> ~4 years ago
[05:08:57] <preference> Cork: are you a freelance web dev?
[05:09:05] <Cork> nope
[05:54:48] <preference> how do i register this nick?
[05:56:09] <preference> oh, got to msg nickserv. so used to kvirc auto-ident haha
[05:59:46] <Cork> preference: as you meantioned it, be careful with /msg nickserv, passwords has been leaked to attacker historically if you use that for auto ident
[06:00:01] <Cork> (so use server auth or /ns or /nickserv instead)
[06:00:37] <preference> will do, but it's just a little irc account haha
[06:01:15] <preference> i'm hiding behind a visual basic GUI anyway so no one can track me
[06:01:19] <Cork> well ya, but email address and possible op permissions so not so little :)
[06:02:48] <preference> someone made a post on reddit about how one of the major issues with web security is not actually password insecurity on websites, but the lack of control on the server/host end
[06:03:37] <preference> because anyone who has access enough to get to the hashed password database already has full access to your account
[06:04:17] <preference> he was saying there's no point encouraging people to get very long passwords because password attacks are very rare, most peoples' accounts get hijacked through obvious stupidity or just mitms
[06:05:43] <preference> btw, did you see this Cork: https://twitter.com/tmobileat/status/981418339653300224
[06:05:51] <preference> (idk if you're interested in security)
[06:14:06] <zenox> hi, is it possible to listen for changes to selects when options are dynamically added / removed?
[06:23:31] <preference> zenox: context?
[06:30:08] <zenox> preference, ok, so i add options to a select from the response of a get... i'd like to listen for when this occurs and run code, without having to manually trigger it in the success handler of the GET request
[06:32:19] <preference> zenox: way beyond me, sorry. Cork ?
[06:43:10] <preference> hi ledtc, zenox had a question which is beyond me. maybe you can help?
[06:43:26] <ledtc> perhaps
[06:43:32] <ledtc> zenox, question ?
[06:43:49] <preference> hi, is it possible to listen for changes to selects when options are dynamically added / removed? /// preference, ok, so i add options to a select from the response of a get... i'd like to listen for when this occurs and run code, without having to manually trigger it in the success handler of the GET request
[06:44:04] <zenox> yeah. that
[06:44:20] <ledtc> Sure that no problem, just give the dynamic options the same class
[06:44:24] <ledtc> as the static
[06:45:30] <ledtc> zenox, ^
[06:47:14] <zenox> what?
[06:47:35] <zenox> that makes no sense!
[06:47:41] <zenox> there is no class
[06:49:41] <daN-R-G> you want to execute something when a new option is removed/added?! Or selected by the user?
[06:58:40] <preference> zenox: ?
[07:00:49] <ledtc> zenox, hmm when user adds options to the select
[07:02:34] <ledtc> zenox, Well..... .size().change()  preference ?
[07:03:23] <zenox> it's ok, nm now!
[07:03:33] <ledtc> ok
[07:03:35] <zenox> thanks anyway
[07:06:55] <preference> ledtc: happy for you to ping me any time, but pretty sure you'll have a better clue at anything related to web dev than me :P
[07:07:15] <ledtc> (Y)
[07:12:18] <Cork> zenox: did you get your answer?
[07:12:38] <Cork> (about modifying select elements)
[07:12:58] <preference> Cork: [12:03] <zenox> it's ok, nm now!
[07:13:06] <Cork> ah
[07:13:59] <Cork> the answer is that events is from user actions not script changes, so adding an option to a select doesn't create events
[07:14:24] <Cork> so one have to have the code adding it tell the interesting party through preferred mean
[07:18:08] <preference> so if you let the users input a list of items, and then you use some code to convert that list into the options of a <select>, that can't trigger an event?
[07:19:30] <Cork> it doesn't trigger an event (except for the normal input event)
[07:19:50] <Cork> the script can create fake events, that is one of the options i talked about at the last line up there
[07:20:01] <preference> ok, so you'd need to have a specific listener for when the <select> changes?
[07:20:04] <Cork> it is what jquery-ui does in a lot of cases for example
[07:20:43] <Cork> no, but you have to do something like .append().trigger('new-option-added')
[07:21:04] <preference> right
[08:22:54] <xenaxon> hello all
[08:22:58] <xenaxon> I'm trying to use dynatables
[08:23:04] <xenaxon> to display a table from the database
[08:23:15] <xenaxon> I setup the API(backend script) and it returns JSON.
[08:23:24] <xenaxon> I followed this stackoverflow thread: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27046425/auto-update-dynatable-with-ajax-json
[08:23:44] <xenaxon> my dynatable is updating upon ajax success, but it's setting all rows to "undefined"
[08:23:52] <xenaxon> anyone has any idea why this is happening?
[08:24:16] <xenaxon> I don't need to json.parse, because I'm already sending json from the server. but it still turns out undefined
[08:24:50] <Cork> xenaxon: https://github.com/alfajango/jquery-dynatable/issues/70 ?
[08:25:16] <Cork> there you have examples of how the json should look
[08:25:29] <Cork> check in your network tab and make sure the format matches
[08:26:27] <Cork> (i personally tend to avoid so answers for javascript questions as they tend to be wrong/old)
[08:26:52] <xenaxon> Cork: I see. So the object key should be the same as the <th> ? But I can't use this because... my database has a different naming convention. I used _ instead of spaces and everything is lowercase
[08:27:18] <Cork> xenaxon: then you have to have some form of translation layer
[08:27:25] <Cork> not sure if dynatable has that
[08:27:28] <xenaxon> Cork: I just tested, and if I set the th same as the database column names it works. but I want to use a human readable Text in the th's
[08:27:46] <preference> Cork: just to say there's a guy with a weird issue in the css chat, might wanna take a look :)
[08:28:58] <Cork> preference: i would start by trying with a clean firefox profile
[08:29:50] <Cork> xenaxon: https://github.com/alfajango/jquery-dynatable/issues/70#issuecomment-195385589
[08:29:58] <Cork> there might be your answer
[08:30:22] <Cork> specifically the second paragraph
[08:33:37] <xenaxon> Cork: That was it:)
[08:33:39] <xenaxon> Cork: man you are fast
[08:33:59] <xenaxon> Cork: Now all I have to figure out is why the styles of dynatables aren't applying?!
[08:34:09] <xenaxon> seems to be loaded fine(the css)
[08:34:26] <Cork> heh, not sure how much i can help you there; not even sure if i've seen dynatable rendered ^^'
[08:34:34] <xenaxon> I don't know why I find, every time I use someone else's library, It doesn't completely work
[08:34:49] <xenaxon> and It takes me a while to just set it up
[08:34:50] <xenaxon> :))
[08:35:03] <Cork> xenaxon: lots of javascript libs are of surprisingly bad quality ya
[08:35:14] <Cork> not saying it is the case here though
[08:35:28] <Cork> xenaxon: if you could reproduce the rendering problem in a jsfiddle i could have a look
[08:37:47] <xenaxon> Cork: I figured it out. it actually doesn't have it's own styling. it's using styling from bootstrap.
[08:38:03] <xenaxon> Cork: so I just needed to style it as I would a simple bootstrap table
[08:38:13] <Cork> nice
[08:51:45] <xenaxon> is there any way to call a function in setInterval on request?
[09:03:21] <Cork> xenaxon: what do you mean?
[09:07:17] <xenaxon> Cork: nothing, just needed to use it as a callback, instead of anony func
[09:18:14] <Legie> Hi there, I have simple question - Can I do using jquery redirect from one page to other (on same domain) and automaticly open some script (for switching tabs for example)?
[09:18:46] <Cork> Legie: switch tab?
[09:18:46] <Legie> If yes, i go to google it more, but I didn't find it yet
[09:18:47] <Cork> what tab?
[09:19:09] <Cork> line a jquery ui tab or an actual browser tab?
[09:19:46] <Legie> Cork: like tabs what change content :)
[09:19:59] <Cork> ...
[09:20:02] <Legie> if you know what i mean
[09:20:03] <Legie> ok
[09:20:05] <Legie> hmmm
[09:20:06] <Cork> no i don't
[09:20:26] <Cork> you need to specify if it is browser or page content tabs your talking about
[09:21:32] <Legie> Cork: like this https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_tabs_dynamic&stacked=h
[09:22:14] <Legie> actually what i want, to link to the page, where are these tabs and open one of them
[09:22:54] <Legie> actually what i want is to link from page 1 to the page2 (where are these tabs) and open one of them
[09:23:06] <Legie> Thts better I hope :)
[09:23:56] <Cork> firstly from guessing (as you refuse to answer the question) it looks like it might be a jquery ui tab so i'm going to assume that is what you're asking about
[09:24:12] <Cork> the jquery ui content is either part of the page or fetched through a ajax url
[09:24:26] <Cork> you might be able to fetch that ajax url if they use that
[09:24:35] <Legie> Ah
[09:24:45] <Cork> if not, then no you can't get just that content, cause it is part of the full page
[09:25:07] <Cork> but for future questions, just answer the questions
[09:30:38] <Legie> Well, thanks for this.
[09:31:23] <Legie> I will make it clear by using some jsfiddle or something, I dont know how to describe that situation :)
[09:31:46] <Legie> It's not hard, but my knowledge
[09:31:51] <Cork> Legie: in this case it would just have been enough to state what widget/content you wanted to access
[09:32:36] <Legie> I wrote my own line of jquery, where I do some action (like hide/show content)
[09:32:47] <Legie> after click on the tabs
[09:33:18] <Legie> I just need to run it using some URL
[09:33:24] <Legie> ye, thanks for advice!
[09:33:28] <Cork> ya, but that was the problem "tabs" is extremely ambiguous
[09:33:53] <Cork> you could almost have said "i wanted to access something"
[09:34:31] <Cork> had you said jquery ui tabs for example, it would have been very easy to answer, (or a div in the page, or...)
[09:48:07] <Legie> there is one page with content like 3 divs with content and just one of them is shown. Script what control content is by clicking on the tabs like $('#box1').click(function() {...show content1 and hide content2 and content3..}
[09:49:04] <Legie> like this https://pastebin.com/XsAbACcq
[09:49:06] <Legie> thats all
[09:50:00] <Cork> then you can only grab it as a whole
[09:50:27] <Cork> (and you can only grab it at all if the site is the same domain as your current page, or is configured to allow it)
[09:50:51] <Legie> and this control the content, this tabs https://pastebin.com/GQ9XrZ87
[09:51:28] <Cork> ya, so it is just shoing/hiding divs
[09:51:52] <Cork> so as a third party, all you can do is grab the full page; unless you modify the page to separate it out into separate resources
[09:53:30] <Legie> Ah, I see.
[09:54:19] <Legie> So there is no good solution for structure like this.
[10:15:57] <preference> Cork: how do i explain to my end user that her idea is stupid?
[10:16:09] <preference> legit question, how do i convince someone that something doesn't make sense?
[10:16:15] <Cork> lol
[10:16:37] <Cork> preference: to start with by not stating that there idea is stupid
[10:16:43] <Cork> :)
[10:16:54] <preference> i haven't
[10:17:03] <preference> though i've made my criticisms extremely clear
[10:17:08] <Cork> possibly try to figure out a better solution and then explain what they gain by going that route?
[10:17:17] <preference> she wants things like flashing text as a banner along the top of the screen
[10:17:19] <preference> with <marquee>
[10:17:38] <Cork> ah, easy <marquee> is depricated and isn't supported anymore
[10:17:47] <preference> she wants that effect, though
[10:17:56] <Cork> ouch...
[10:17:57] <preference> that's just what i remember the text as
[10:18:02] <preference> tag*
[10:18:10] <Cork> ya, blinking text is marquee
[10:18:32] <Cork> maybe explain the tag was deprecated for a reason?
[10:18:53] <Cork> (and that it will quite likely drive users away to some extent)
[10:20:01] <preference> i need a serious way of explaining that some things just don't look good
[10:20:05] <preference> she's absolutely design blind
[10:22:10] <Cork> preference: well top be perfectly honest are you hired to design it for her or give her a site?
[10:22:28] <Cork> might actually be "it is her site she can do what ever she wants"
[10:23:36] <preference> Cork: the context is that i handle all the administration, which now also includes taking over an increasing amount of development for the website
[10:25:39] <Cork> preference: administration, development and design isn't the same thing though
[10:26:28] <preference> ya, it is in this case
[10:26:50] <Cork> if you can't reason about it it might be worth figuring out who should have the authority of that part and then just go with what the one with the authority says
[10:27:04] <preference> do you know of a site which demonstrates good practise in web design?
[10:27:20] <Cork> heh... is there one? :D j/k
[10:27:29] <Cork> webpages are often all over the place
[10:27:43] <Cork> but there are some iso standards
[10:27:53] <Cork> and blinking does have implication there
[10:29:36] <Cork> preference: i've seen a few refs to https://theblog.adobe.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-web-design/ (i'm quite sure google have one too, but can't find it right now)
[10:30:10] <Cork> ah, ofcourse it has moved to material
[10:30:23] <Cork> preference: https://material.io/guidelines/
[10:30:43] <Cork> preference: but guidelines for webdesign isn't a "one thing" so ya...
[10:30:57] <MikeD_> what part of web design practice are you trying to make "good" ?
[10:30:57] <Cork> not sure if you can win it by going that route
[10:31:15] <Cork> MikeD_: the part that uses blinking text
[10:31:18] <Cork> :)
[10:31:25] <preference> Cork: thanks for the links
[10:31:59] <MikeD_> oh, if you're going that route you need jiggling banner ads too
[10:32:11] <MikeD_> "punch the monkey"
[10:32:20] <Cork> lol
[10:32:35] <Cork> don't forget the agif backgrounds
[10:32:53] <preference> a lot of the things she wants aren't as overtly stupid so much as she fails to see the issue with hiding all the information necessary for the customer to do what they want.
[10:33:17] <preference> e.g. she doesn't mind if a customer can spend 10 mins customising their order on the product page, then goes to checkout, then if they want to change it, they have to remove it and do it all over again
[10:33:45] <MikeD_> that would piss me off, i'd never purchase again
[10:33:51] <preference> exactly what i'd say
[10:33:57] <preference> said, even
[10:34:09] <MikeD_> well now your argument includes "some guy on IRC said..."
[10:34:20] <Cork> order again, i would most likely just close the page instead of remove or order it
[10:34:25] <preference> if i accidentally added dickpic_3.jpg and i had to reset everything, i'd just stop trying
[10:34:53] <Cork> heh ya
[10:35:13] <Cork> but the adobe link would argue quite strongly against those problems
[10:35:22] <Cork> blinking text is a bit harder though
[10:35:39] <Legie> Cork: thank you btw!
[10:35:43] <Cork> one can go the iana route but sadly many "owners" don't care
[10:35:44] <Legie> have to go, cu
[10:35:47] <Cork> o/
[10:36:05] <MikeD_> claim it's a violation of 508 compliance and that it must have a seizure warning before you can show the page, so it's probably not worth it
[10:36:13] <preference> you know what the best part of the checkout thing is?
[10:36:23] <preference> she actually commissioned our _awful_ web developers to make it so that it's editable
[10:36:28] <preference> or at least removable for certain aspects
[10:36:42] <preference> but it was so badly designed that she just decided to throw it out altogether
[10:36:59] <MikeD_> even awful web designers have to eat
[10:37:13] <preference> they were paid in full, she's not unreasonable like that
[10:37:14] <MikeD_> it's the same argument for tipping a bad waiter
[10:37:41] <Cork> to the webdesigners offense though, those pos libs (that are often built on top of cms systems) are a PITA to admin and modify
[10:38:13] <Cork> i actaully did that in a former life i don't want to remember...
[10:39:02] <preference> well, i don't want to get into too much detail publicly
[10:39:13] <Cork> ya
[10:39:32] <preference> but i'm sure over the course of time you will get to know all the glorious details of our web devs etc. it's quite a story
[10:39:36] <preference> anyway, for now, i'm out
[10:39:43] <preference> see ya and thanks for the links Cork  o/
[11:40:13] <zenox> Cork, thanks, i just scrolled up and was reading what you typed earlier in response to my q. can you really do .trigger('some-custom-event')?
[12:27:14] <MikeD_> zenox: yes
[13:16:50] <sunrunner20> google isn't turning up an answer: is it possible to place something on say <form> that will run a JS function every time one of the form's inputs (generic, including textarea) changes?
[13:17:12] <taplar> the change event should bubble iirc
[13:17:43] <taplar> yeah it bubbles
[13:18:08] <sunrunner20> so I can just slap an onchange="fun()" onto form?
[13:18:19] <taplar> i wouldn't do an inline binding, but sure
[13:18:33] <sunrunner20> what's wrong with inline bindings?
[13:18:59] <taplar> various reasons.  one being you are intermixing your logic with your markup, so you are bleeding your controller logic into your view
[13:19:27] <taplar> it's typically preferred to use addEventListener in javascript to perform bindings
[13:20:44] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6941483/onclick-vs-event-handler#21975639
[13:20:48] <taplar> for more reading
[13:22:57] <sunrunner20> i'll take a look when I can
[13:23:09] <tobh> not to mention, if you set the X-XSS-Protection header, it disables inline JS unless you explicitly set "unsafe-inline" which defeats the entire purpose of this header.
[13:23:58] <taplar> didn't know about that one
[13:36:53] <zenox> MikeD_, nice, thanks. i didn't know that! that'll save me some headaches!
[14:26:29] <kek9001> does .html() unescape the whole html?
[14:26:33] <kek9001> does it keep it the same
[14:27:11] <kek9001> so if i got <span>&lt; does it leave it as it is or does it do <span><
[14:28:00] <taplar> easy enough to test
[14:28:09] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/oe061e49/ kek9001
[14:28:12] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[14:28:39] <kek9001> holy
[14:28:48] <kek9001> thanks robertmaxrees
[14:28:54] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:29:09] <kek9001> why would it do that tho :s
[14:29:14] <robertmaxrees> do what?
[14:29:17] <robertmaxrees> keep it the same?
[14:29:29] <kek9001> it unescapes it tho
[14:29:34] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:29:37] <robertmaxrees> look at your console.
[14:29:39] <kek9001> transforms &lt; into <
[14:29:41] <robertmaxrees> it should you the markup.
[14:29:47] <robertmaxrees> *shows
[14:29:47] <robertmaxrees> brb
[14:30:13] <kek9001> oh sorry and thanks
[14:30:40] <kek9001> sorry and thanks
[14:31:10] <robertmaxrees> back
[14:40:46] <robertmaxrees> oontz
[14:41:29] <taplar> just figured out how to precache some json files.  woot
[14:52:04] <robertmaxrees> noice
[14:53:30] <taplar> next time to figure out how to put them into indexedDB and use it in routes
[15:00:36] <vish93> HI guys I am using localStorage to save the checkbox state, now on refresh how would I ensure the checkbox stays checked ?
[15:01:20] <robertmaxrees> vish93 read localstorage and react accordingly.
[15:01:20] <jak2000> hi all
[15:01:22] <jak2000> good morning
[15:01:40] <taplar> bonjour
[15:03:12] <vish93> okay, makes sense. Is there a way to set checkbox to checked without causing the change to avoid logic being repeated i.e saving to localstorage?
[15:03:32] <taplar> are you setting it on the change event?
[15:07:17] * taplar taps the mic
[15:40:42] <vish93> Sorry taplar nope
[15:40:52] <vish93> solved it now, every so sorry
[15:41:10] <taplar> you got me curious now.  how are you changing the storage value?
[15:43:50] <taplar> left hanging twice!
[15:43:56] <taplar> :'(
[16:07:44] <robertmaxrees> heckuva day so far.
[16:07:55] <taplar> yup
[16:08:26] <robertmaxrees> finally got my newest microservice working in production today :)
[16:08:40] <taplar> finally?
[16:09:18] <robertmaxrees> been working on it for a few months.  got held up by our sre team.
[16:09:47] <robertmaxrees> i've been on this project since like september
[16:10:53] <taplar> nice.  must be a relief
[16:11:36] <robertmaxrees> yeah, especially because we're making some big changes to our search.
[16:19:16] <catbadger> hey
[16:19:24] <catbadger> I'm trapped in a nightmare. anyone around/
[16:19:26] <catbadger> ?
[16:19:33] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:19:38] <taplar> you want us to join your nightmare?
[16:19:47] <catbadger> are you familiar with bootstrap and glyphicons?
[16:20:02] <robertmaxrees> catbadger even if we weren't, we may still be able to help :)
[16:20:07] <catbadger> because here's what's up...
[16:20:08] <robertmaxrees> ask your question - if somebody can help, we will.
[16:21:05] <catbadger> We are upgrading all libraries, and bootstrap decided to drop support for glyphicons in bootstrap 4... this should be fine, just copy the font files and relevant css, right? WRONG. the actual icons that are showing are completely wrong...
[16:21:11] <catbadger> I'm working on a fiddle.
[16:21:34] <catbadger> my boss says "they can't make something unfree..." yes they can. they did.
[16:21:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:21:50] <robertmaxrees> "they can't make something unfree"?
[16:22:02] <catbadger> lol
[16:22:36] <taplar> looks like glyphicons pro costs $$$ if that's what he's referring to
[16:22:41] <ExoUNX> I'm making this comment unfree (c)
[16:22:58] <catbadger> yeah, we just need what was available in bootstrap3...
[16:23:02] <taplar> there is a free version though
[16:23:15] <catbadger> the free version requires a visible credit on your app
[16:23:35] <robertmaxrees> https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/migration/#components
[16:23:49] <ExoUNX> so you need to advertise bootstrap on a website that uses bootstrap 4?
[16:23:53] <catbadger> no
[16:23:59] <robertmaxrees> glyphicons.
[16:24:25] <robertmaxrees> if glyphicons are so important, why doesn't your company pony up the cash?
[16:24:29] <catbadger> right?
[16:24:30] <catbadger> haha
[16:24:43] <robertmaxrees> it's $60 ...
[16:24:47] <taplar> i wonder if you could go back through the revisions of https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap and grab the icons
[16:24:58] <catbadger> i tried that taplar.
[16:25:05] <catbadger> the icons are all wrong in bootstrap 4
[16:25:05] <ExoUNX> I bought the new fontawesome pack for $60, it's pretty nice
[16:25:28] <taplar> so look at one of the other branches
[16:25:45] <taplar> https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/v3.3.7
[16:25:52] <taplar> there's a dropdown that you can switch the tags/branches
[16:26:09] <robertmaxrees> i think he wants to upgrade to v4 but keep the old glyphicons.
[16:26:31] <taplar> oh, and sticking the icons from 3 in 4 isn't working then?
[16:26:59] <robertmaxrees> they changed a bunch of classnames and stuff i'm guessing.
[16:27:07] <taplar> ah
[16:29:11] <catbadger> also we can't lisence anything that's non-free. our CE is FOSS
[16:29:38] <catbadger> and no, just stuffing 3's version in doesn't work. All the icons are showing wrong.
[16:30:58] <robertmaxrees> could you clarify what you mean by "showing wrong"?
[16:31:15] <robertmaxrees> like, are they the wrong icons entirely, or are they just styled poorly?
[16:32:53] <robertmaxrees> catbadger
[16:33:46] <ExoUNX> oh they dropped glyphicons
[16:33:46] <ExoUNX> https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/migration/#components
[16:34:22] <ExoUNX> was looking at this - http://tagliala.github.io/vectoriconsroundup/
[16:34:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:34:29] <taplar> ^
[16:34:30] <robertmaxrees> we already established that.
[16:35:45] <dnscat> if a plugin does $.fn.extend({search: function(foo){ /* do something */ }}); How does the function accepting 'foo' get called?
[16:36:09] <taplar> $().search(...)
[16:36:20] <dnscat> oh
[16:36:27] <dnscat> haha that was easy. k thanks
[16:36:28] <taplar> $.fn methods exist on jQuery objects
[16:36:47] <taplar> vs things like $.ajax which exist on the jQuery namespace object
[16:50:14] <catbadger> just got back
[16:50:28] <catbadger> they were the wrong icons entirely.
[16:51:13] <catbadger> this works though.. I wonder if it's the bootstrap4 inclusion? maybe they sabotage the icons in 4?
[16:51:15] <catbadger> https://jsfiddle.net/ytzd39zx/10/
[16:52:05] <taplar> when you were trying to include the previous icons in the page, were you including them before or after bootstrap?
[16:53:04] <taplar> i'm just wondering if you were including them before and bootstrap was overriding the definitions they made
[16:53:08] <catbadger> with bootstrap
[16:53:12] <catbadger> as part of bootstrap 3
[16:53:20] <taplar> i mean now with 4
[16:53:37] <catbadger> oh, i tried both. same result. the icons that showed were wrong
[16:53:42] <taplar> bah
[16:53:45] <taplar> :(
[16:53:51] <catbadger> trying another approach . brb
[16:57:29] <smorkie> hey guys, so iam using a <button> , to load(.php #divID) into a <div>, that works just fine, if i add something that if clicked should display an alert box, that click() is not workin, i also tried with on(), if i load the .php directly everything works as it should, does this sound familiar to anyone?
[16:59:03] <taplar> sounds like you need a delegate event binding
[16:59:16] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[16:59:53] <robertmaxrees> ^ simply using .on() isn't enough.
[16:59:57] <robertmaxrees> slightly different usage
[17:00:27] <catbadger> and broken like this: https://jsfiddle.net/ytzd39zx/12/
[17:00:29] <catbadger> finally
[17:00:56] <taplar> what did you have to do?
[17:00:57] <smorkie> taplar  https://stackoverflow.com/a/6658774  i tried this, no luck
[17:01:00] <catbadger> that icon should be a map marker, but it's some messed up bars.
[17:01:27] <catbadger> i removed the link to the cdn copy of the  css and pasted it into the css box.
[17:01:35] <catbadger> really doesn't tell us what's wrong
[17:01:52] <robertmaxrees> smorkie can you show us?
[17:01:55] <robertmaxrees> your code I mean.
[17:01:59] <catbadger> https://jsfiddle.net/ytzd39zx/14/ more minimal
[17:02:13] <taplar> smorkie: when you changed it to be a delegate binding, did you change what you bound on?
[17:02:26] <robertmaxrees> catbadger maybe ##bootstrap can help?
[17:02:46] <catbadger> 'good suggstion robertmaxrees. i'll ask there
[17:05:17] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:08:06] <smorkie> mm yeah i guess i could put it on jsfiddle, after a ton of editing, just too late for that now zZzzZ hehe
[17:08:40] <smorkie> i should re-ask tomorrow x)
[17:08:42] <robertmaxrees> erm
[17:09:08] <robertmaxrees> when you changed to "on" did you just do $(element).on('click', function() {});?
[17:09:56] <robertmaxrees> 'cause it's a super simple change :)
[17:12:50] <smorkie> i went from $(element).click(function(){   to $(element).on("click", somethingsomething , yeah its getting late so probably just confusing myself hirr
[17:13:04] <taplar> no, you can't do that
[17:13:23] <taplar> when you change from $(element).on() to a delegate, the 'element' has to change to be a parent selector
[17:13:41] <taplar> the parent must contain the elements you want to process the event on
[17:14:06] <taplar> so say you got something like $('.delete').on('click', removeUser);
[17:14:14] <taplar> but you have dynamic users
[17:14:28] <taplar> if all your users belonged to a parent of '.users' then it would be
[17:14:42] <taplar> $('.users').on('click', '.delete', removeUser)
[17:14:45] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:15:06] <robertmaxrees> gotta be some parent that exists at the time of binding
[17:15:35] <robertmaxrees> s/parent/ancestor
[17:19:15] <smorkie> oi ok copypasting replies to huuuge notes.txt  thanks hehe
[17:19:46] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:19:50] <smorkie> gonna have todo some more reading for sure
[17:19:57] <robertmaxrees> read the learning center article on the subject :)
[17:41:11] <taplar> want to have a little chuckle or a slight wtf moment?
[17:41:30] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49784758/check-if-element-exists-then-remove-it-from-ajax-response
[17:42:10] <robertmaxrees> what
[17:42:11] <robertmaxrees> i
[17:42:14] <robertmaxrees> what?
[17:42:19] <taplar> lol
[17:42:24] <robertmaxrees> what is he even doing
[17:42:40] <taplar> well the part i've caught so far is the unnecessary string conversion
[17:42:59] <robertmaxrees> the description itself is weird af
[17:43:13] <taplar> true
[17:43:14] <robertmaxrees> like, what?
[17:43:21] <robertmaxrees> what is he actually building?
[17:43:37] <taplar> i'm assuming he wants to check if the tag already exists on the page, and if it does, remove it from the response so it's not processed again
[17:43:42] <taplar> instead of just skipping adding it again
[17:43:50] <robertmaxrees> the ux seems odd.
[18:53:51] <lucas_ai__> is it possible to use the <link> tag to include HTML or text and read it in javascript?
[18:56:27] <taplar> not sure.  i'm assuming it would be based on what you put as the rel value
[18:56:46] <taplar> it does look like there is a rel="html" but it's not widely implemented
[18:57:09] <taplar> sorry, rel="import"
[18:57:54] <robertmaxrees> lucas_ai__ why do you want to do that? :)
[19:04:53] <dnscat> hey robertmaxrees I remember you
[19:05:07] <dnscat> I remember that you know your stuff when it comes to js/jquery
[19:05:16] <taplar> i would expect that from a dns
[19:05:23] <dnscat> hehe :)
[19:05:40] <dnscat> Sometimes it takes 24 hours for me to absorb a new memory :P
[19:05:55] <taplar> i feel ya
[19:06:22] <robertmaxrees> i know some things.
[19:07:54] <dnscat> well I like your humility
[19:26:48] <lucas_ai__> is it possible to use the <link> tag to include HTML or text and read it in javascript? I'm running a local html in chrome, so it cannot normally read other local files unless linked this way
[19:26:50] <lucas_ai__> robertmaxrees,
[19:27:18] <robertmaxrees> so let's flip that around: why not run a simple dev server?
[19:27:56] <lucas_ai__> because it's annoying and cumbersome
[19:28:10] <lucas_ai__> and when a new developer opens index.html in the browser, it breaks, for NO good reason
[19:28:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:28:28] <robertmaxrees> "a new developer" like, at your job?
[19:28:30] <lucas_ai__> you can't expect devs to always run a webserver
[19:28:37] <lucas_ai__> robertmaxrees, in my team
[19:28:46] <robertmaxrees> at your job tho, right?
[19:28:52] <lucas_ai__> robertmaxrees, it should be easy to open the html and see it... NO need for a webserver
[19:28:54] <robertmaxrees> just trying to understand the problems you're trying to solve.
[19:28:59] <lucas_ai__> robertmaxrees, no, it's my own app
[19:29:23] <lucas_ai__> robertmaxrees, when I work with others it's remotely
[19:29:26] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you're kind of SOL without there being a server :/ you might be able to hack something together but I doubt it.
[19:29:29] <lucas_ai__> over the internet
[19:29:39] <robertmaxrees> but i wouldn't say it's unreasonable to expect them to run a local webserver.
[19:29:43] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec brb
[19:29:47] <lucas_ai__> robertmaxrees, it's not possible to do <link rel="something"> ??
