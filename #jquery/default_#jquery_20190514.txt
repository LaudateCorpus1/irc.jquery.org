[13:22:36] <robertparkerx> I have a site where the on click or click is not working but I got a example working on jsfiddle. I'm not sure what is happeneing. I have tried to upgrade jQuery and that didn't seem to help either. I even can't seem to get evventListener to work.
[13:22:48] <robertparkerx> But they both work on jsfiddle
[14:41:57] <z1haze> what's the correct way to use :not with an element's name?
[14:42:13] <z1haze> trying here `find(':input:not(select.country):not([name=addresType])')`
[14:49:01] <z1haze> ha, if i could spell address correctly..
[16:18:35] <R13ose> I am doing https://pastebin.com/AxjGP2uH but I am not sure why data is still empty.  Any ideas?
[16:29:20] <pavonia> R13ose: What does the server respond with?
[16:30:25] <R13ose> the console log say Success! Data: undefined? pavonia
[16:30:37] <R13ose> Without the question marj
[16:30:43] <R13ose> mark*
[16:32:04] <pavonia> Have you checked the actual response in your browser (or server-side)?
[16:34:20] <pavonia> If the returned text isn't a JSON object and parsed as one, data.statusText will be undefined
[16:35:26] <R13ose> pavonia: how do I check that?  I see what I see in console but not sure how to make sure the data is JSON.
[16:36:18] <pavonia> You can print data in the console first, or the second argument of your handler
[16:37:04] <pavonia> Firefox for example has this feature: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Network_Monitor/request_details
[16:38:49] <R13ose> One sec
[16:41:27] <R13ose> pavonia: the data says {result: "success", row: 78} but nothing when I click the arrow on left side.  The items shows 5 items in an array
[16:52:26] <pavonia> R13ose: Not sure hwat row is supposed to mean. What kind of data do you expect to be returned from the server?
[16:54:25] <R13ose> I get an error
[16:55:13] <pavonia> ?
[16:55:16] <R13ose> pavonia: SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected end of data at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data.
[16:55:49] <pavonia> That tells me nothing without context
[16:56:06] <pavonia> What data do you expect from the server?
[16:56:32] <R13ose> I am trying to push data to Google Sheets
[16:57:50] <R13ose> pavonia: I am unsure what I am suppose to get from server
[16:59:54] <pavonia> Is {result: "success", row: 78} the data object?
[17:00:13] <pavonia> Because the row thing would make sense then
[17:02:49] <R13ose> pavonia: how do I know that?
[17:10:36] <pavonia> R13ose: Well, you posted that line :p
[17:12:03] <pavonia> You can check if console.log(data.result) prints "success"
[17:12:35] <pavonia> Because I guess your data already is the parsed JSON object
[17:13:46] <R13ose> pavonia: yes it does
[17:16:37] <pavonia> Okay, looks right then
[17:16:57] <R13ose> pavonia: meaning?
[17:18:03] <pavonia> data then already is the result from the server
[17:18:48] <pavonia> Giving you the row the new data has been inserted into the DB, as it seems
[17:19:04] <R13ose> pavonia: before items was there in var jqxhr line, it was $form.serializeArray() which var $form = $(e.target);
[17:19:40] <R13ose> Yes but in the spreadsheet the cells say undefined.
[17:20:28] <pavonia> I can't tell what the server is actually doing
[17:20:52] <R13ose> Do you want to see server code?
[17:21:19] <R13ose> pavonia: ^
[17:21:52] <pavonia> Uh, didn't you say you are pushing data to Google? O.o
[17:22:30] <R13ose> pavonia: yes but there is form script that was created
[17:22:54] <pavonia> Well, show me then
[17:24:16] <R13ose> pavonia: https://pastebin.com/DaGXuH2A
[17:30:06] <pavonia> R13ose: Does the counter change if you add another row?
[17:30:33] <R13ose> Yes the counter goes up
[17:31:19] <R13ose> pavonia: ^
[17:32:59] <pavonia> Hhm, not sure where the error is then, not in the client code at least
[17:35:55] <R13ose> pavonia: am I entering the data in the row on the Google side?
[17:36:39] <pavonia> What do you mean?
[17:37:05] <pavonia> sheet.getRange(nextRow, 1, 1, row.length).setValues([row]); seems to be what is supposed to add them
[17:37:49] <R13ose> pavonia: yes but are the right values in row?
[17:39:17] <pavonia> I don't know. Check with some debug output
[17:43:11] <R13ose> Okay
[18:39:56] <R13ose> This is still driving me crazy
[18:42:03] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:50:38] <robertmaxrees> welp
[19:19:53] <R13ose> What I was working on above is still not doing anything and I tried to debug and got nowhere.
[19:25:01] <R13ose> I have tried everything, I can think of.
[19:34:40] <pavonia> The problem doesn't seem to be related to jQuery, so better ask in a channel that is better suited, e.g. ##programming
[19:35:40] <R13ose> Thanks
