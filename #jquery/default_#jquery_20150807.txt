[02:51:57] <jbove> Hi!  If a test requires jQuery ($), but npm is returning "Cannot find module 'jquery'" even-though it is installed in the node_modules folder and listed in npm list, is this a mocha or npm issue? More info and screenshots: http://blog.johanbove.info/blog/2015/08/07/mocha-npm-module-jquery.html Thanks!
[02:53:10] <jbove> This is probably an NPM or node issue as when I try to load "jquery" using require('jquery') in the node console I get the same error.
[02:57:09] <mehale> hi folks, whats the name of those forms that you can add new elements on the fly, depending on what the user wants?
[02:59:13] <jbove> @mehale You mean combo boxes?
[03:01:34] <mehale> jbove, no. imagine that you have a form to search people. then an option to search by: name, last name, city, birth year. after the user choses this first item, a new form piece will be shown to him to enter the data.
[03:02:05] <mehale> dynamic form?
[03:03:35] <jbove> Well, that's still a "combo box" to me :-) But you can call it a "dynamic search form" if you like.
[03:04:51] <mehale> jbove: I simplified it, but what will be shown depends on the combo box option, and then user can add another item, and so on

[08:27:25] <surianup> can you please click on the page
[08:30:13] <surianup> taplar
[08:31:09] <taplar> ok, so you want to go to that id on page load
[08:31:25] <xenod> please someone know mCustomscrollbar ? i have some trouble with it
[08:33:30] <surianup> is
[08:33:38] <surianup> you are right taplar
[08:33:48] <surianup> there is the "Rentals" and "Resale" button
[08:33:57] <surianup> please clcik on one
[08:35:36] <taplar> surianup: what about something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/ft9gwssw/1/
[08:36:46] <surianup> taplar you are absolutly right
[08:37:17] <surianup> but I will not clcik on the anchor or user will not clcik on it
[08:37:45] <taplar> you just need to know what to use in the animate other than 'link3'
[08:37:52] <taplar> whatever you want to go to
[08:37:54] <surianup> I want to click automatically when page will laod
[08:38:13] <taplar> hold on
[08:38:16] <surianup> ok
[08:38:29] <taplar> are you talking about scrolling, or are you talking about activating Rentals or Resale on page load?
[08:38:47] <surianup> I am talking about acrolling
[08:38:54] <surianup> scrolling
[08:39:09] <taplar> ok, so that does that
[08:39:13] <surianup> when I will click on these two buttons
[08:39:16] <surianup> http://demo.stellans.com/propertyhub
[08:39:22] <taplar> yeah i got the link
[08:39:22] <surianup> rental and resale
[08:39:38] <surianup> after that we have to scroll down
[08:39:49] <surianup> where ia hve put the anchor
[08:40:25] <taplar> right, if you use '#btn_div_trigger' as the selector instead of '#link3' it should auto scroll to it
[08:40:35] <surianup> yeas
[08:40:39] <surianup> yeah
[08:41:34] <surianup> but problem Is that my $("#ancr_for_btn").trigger( "click"); is not working
[08:41:46] <taplar> what are you trying to do with that?
[08:42:14] <surianup> on the $(window).load(function() {} I have put htis code
[08:42:50] <surianup> have you seen the "clickme" on the banner video section
[08:42:59] <surianup> same work it will do
[08:43:44] <xenod> please someone know mCustomscrollbar ? i have some trouble with it
[08:43:46] <taplar> i'm still confused.  what is triggering the anchor supossed to do?
[08:45:30] <taplar> if you do the animate it will put the anchor at the top of the page, so i'm not sure what extra logic your trying to accomplish with the click
[08:45:47] <surianup> ok taplar
[08:45:55] <surianup> just do it please
[08:46:18] <taplar> i don't know what 'it' is.  lol, tha's what i'm asking
[08:46:38] <taplar> are you wanting to use the click instead of the animate?
[08:47:12] <surianup> yes I want to use the clcik
[08:47:15] <surianup> yes I want to use the click
[08:47:34] <taplar> that element is a div, so it won't do anything for a click by default
[08:47:55] <taplar> you could change it into an empty a tag and the click should work
[08:48:01] <surianup> then what to do?
[08:48:24] <taplar> hold on
[08:48:32] <surianup> ok
[08:49:12] <Dr-007> i'm using .serialize() in jquery on a form of mine. it serializes all fields inside the form BUT one
[08:49:18] <ZoffixWork> Hi, I'm loading an HTML file with .get() and inserting it into my document. That file contains a <form> and I'm trying to change its action="" attribute. This is my code, but it's got an issue: http://jsfiddle.net/wuh21kjb/1/  that alert() on line 7 reports 0 elements found; after I close that alert, the action="" gets changed. But if I remove that alert(), then nothing gets changed. Seems like there's a race condition between inserting my HTML
[08:49:18] <Dr-007> which is weird.

[09:03:38] <Dr-007> i'm now using .serializeArray() to get an array. so i can add the missing field myself. how do i convert this array to the serialize string?
[09:04:38] <Dr-007> oh never mind. i can just pass this serialzeArray() to getJSON and getAjax
[09:04:44] <Dr-007> weeeeee
[09:15:32] <LindsayMac> I'm working on overriding a backbone.js event and I need to have it trigger only on change of a specific element.. I know how to do this with something like input[type!="checkbox"] but I have no idea how to do with, for instance, all elements that have [] in their name attribute
[09:16:28] <LindsayMac> I actually even know how to get only elements with [] in their name. I just have no idea how to put it into the events controller syntax
[09:16:43] <LindsayMac> This is basically the line of code I have: wp.media.view.AttachmentCompat.prototype.events['change input[name!="checkbox"]'] = 'save';
[09:17:11] <LindsayMac> the problem is that checkboxes aren't the only type that could pass an array of values. Selects set as 'multiple' could as well.
[09:17:56] <LindsayMac> and I know that this can get elements with [] as the last two of the name attribute .length > 2 && '[]' == .name.substr( .name.length - 2 )
[09:18:34] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[09:19:27] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  i dont think i could make a fiddle that is actually interactive because there is a large library involved.
[09:19:42] <robertmaxrees> you're talking about binding an event listener with backbone, right?
[09:19:44] <LindsayMac> I am trying to override the save function of a view
[09:19:54] <robertmaxrees> err, what?
[09:20:22] <LindsayMac> ok let me see if I can collect my thoughts and make a better response to your question
[09:20:41] <robertmaxrees> you were saying that you're trying to bind an event listener using an attribute contains selector
[09:20:59] <robertmaxrees> now you're trying to overwrite a method on a view - is the view already initialized?
[09:21:54] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  well both. That is the use case of how my event listener would be used... not directly in a view but overriding the view using something like delete wp.media.view.AttachmentCompat.prototype.events['change input'];
[09:23:15] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to modify a view that's already instatiated?  why not just update the actual view?
[09:23:17] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  i am still learning JS. I have never actually worked with MVC in JS so I'm rreading through docs. I know the basics of JS like DOM manipulation and such
[09:23:30] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  well, I can't change the core files of WP (or shouldnt)
[09:23:37] <LindsayMac> and the view is in core.
[09:24:40] <robertmaxrees> so modifying a view after you've instatiated it is a bad idea and not going to be terribly reliable.  what are you building?
[09:26:25] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  i have found that the wordpress modal window that holds all of the media UI for managing images when you're in the "post edit" screen uses ajax to send a "save" function every time you change between form fields. The problem I have found is that it only sends this change request for the item you changed.. so if you have a multiple select checkbox OR a multiple select <select>, it only sends the va
[09:26:25] <LindsayMac> lue of the ONE thing you just selected, not the entire list.
[09:26:55] <robertmaxrees> that kind of change is going to require that you edit core, then.
[09:26:59] <LindsayMac> I need to override that ajax so that when you change a specific field that has name=something[] it doesn't just grab the value you changed, but it grabs the entire element
[09:27:14] <robertmaxrees> because at that point you're changing core behavior.
[09:27:26] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  i have kind of already got it working with checkboxes... I just dont know how to make it work with anythign that has name=something[]
[09:27:52] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  yes.. and I will issue a patch when I am done.. but until then I need an upgrade proof solution
[09:28:00] <robertmaxrees> this isn't upgrade proof...
[09:28:12] <LindsayMac> its more upgrade proof than writing it directly into core.
[09:28:35] <LindsayMac> because I can watch for changes to that function in trac.
[09:28:36] <robertmaxrees> I'd fork core and have a patch that gets applied to it, but meh.
[09:28:49] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  you know how long it takes patches to get applied to wp?
[09:28:53] <LindsayMac> too long
[09:28:58] <robertmaxrees> i'm not talking about patches by that team.
[09:29:25] <robertmaxrees> i mean you create the patch that you then manually apply yourself whenever you update.  but i digress - the events object in backbone should be able to take any "jquery" style selector.
[09:29:29] <LindsayMac> Ojh yea. i cant do that because the hosting company that the client is on manages updates for them
[09:29:30] <robertmaxrees> i may have that wrong, though.
[09:29:41] <LindsayMac> WP ENGINE would not allow that.
[09:29:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:30:19] <robertmaxrees> ah i see what you're saying.t
[09:30:21] <LindsayMac> WP engine does auto updates randomly when they're available. i would have to be on call to issue that patch the minute WP Engine does the upgrade for the client
[09:30:41] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to be on call to issue fixes to your current solution, as well :)
[09:31:03] <LindsayMac> Well, if I can watch the trac I would know when a patch to that file is going to be issued before its released at least
[09:31:16] <LindsayMac> so it wouldt break the live production version of the site
[09:31:16] <robertmaxrees> either way, i'd check with #documentcloud about the event binding questions, but you should be able to use any normal selector there.
[09:31:41] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees: i guess my issue is that im not looking to bind to any normal selector but a PART of a selector
[09:32:02] <robertmaxrees> you want an attribute contains selector./
[09:32:07] <xenod> can someone help me i have trouble with mcustomscrollbar , api is load and look like ok but not affect the target http://jsfiddle.net/xenod/3jpcdq05/7/#&togetherjs=0180lu3GUE
[09:32:18] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sure what backbone fully supports, so i'd ask in #documentcloud and find out.
[09:33:06] <robertmaxrees> xenod i'm ot sure what you're asking - could you clarify?
[09:34:03] <xenod> robertmaxrees: on test div mscrollbar work but on other it's dont work
[09:34:32] <robertmaxrees> #overlay doesn't work, xenod?
[09:34:38] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees: basically I have an if statement that finds if the .name.length > 2 && '[]' == .name.substr(.name.length -2)
[09:34:58] <robertmaxrees> LindsayMac yeah, that's a question for #documentcloud, since i'm not sure what selectors they support :)
[09:35:10] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  ok.. i'll try there
[09:35:37] <robertmaxrees> xelim what about it doesn't work?
[09:35:40] <robertmaxrees> err, xenod
[09:37:59] <xenod> robertmaxrees: yes dont work on #overlay but work on #test
[09:38:26] <robertmaxrees> xenod clarify what you mean by that - what's not happening that you're expecting to happen?
[09:39:12] <xenod> apply mcustomscrollbar on div #chat_message but it doesn't work
[09:39:23] <xenod> on div #test it's work
[09:39:38] <robertmaxrees> i gathered ;)
[09:43:25] <robertmaxrees> are you sure that's the right selector to init on?
[09:44:43] <xenod> jQuery("#chat_message").mCustomScrollbar({                     axis:"y" ,                     theme:"rounded-dark"                 });
[09:45:01] <xenod> it's ok
[09:45:09] <robertmaxrees> right - is that the correct selector?  this feels really convoluted and hard to read so i'm trying to understand what's going on :)
[09:45:32] <xenod> selector is good
[09:46:01] <xenod> it's look like applyed but not visible
[09:46:12] <robertmaxrees> sounds like it's not applied then?
[09:46:19] <xenod> yes
[09:48:24] <robertmaxrees> are you able to pair this fiddle down at all?
[09:49:40] <xenod> pair this page ?
[09:50:10] <robertmaxrees> like, simplify it?  there's a lot of stuff going on here and it's hard to understand what's relevant.

[10:24:45] <sash_> Hi, I found this code snippet in a wordpress theme of a friend of mine: http://fpaste.org/252776/14389681/ The only thing, I can see that it does, is making it impossible to scroll the affected area via touch. I removed it from the script and now the scrolling works. But I wonder what the purpose of this thing might be? Some old touch compatibility that all modern browsers now have builtin?
[10:25:19] <sash_> The touchhandler is here: http://fpaste.org/252777/89683111/
[10:45:02] <FearDread> Greetings fellow jQuery junkies!
[11:10:58] <NeedSomeHelp> Hello, I am creating a fixed top responsive navbar for my site. I have a little problem with it. I cant seem to avoid the burgermenu to crash and overlap with the search function when making the window smaller/narrower. Anyone have time to assist me a little? http://www.cirithungol.org/band/cactus/
[11:33:46] <saml> how can I reliably make click or dbclick event not follow <a href> ?  even if I do  $('a').off('click dbclick').on({'click': function(){return false;}, 'dbclick', ...);     users can click an <img> inside <a> and bypasses that
[11:34:00] <robertmaxrees> you don't use .off() for the href.
[11:34:05] <robertmaxrees> e.preventDefault();
[11:34:22] <saml> $('*').off('click dbclick')....  works. but breaks other stuff such as form submit event handler
[11:34:31] <robertmaxrees> right - you don't do that.
[11:35:12] <gambl0re> sup playboy...
[11:35:19] <saml> let me try preventDefault(); return false;    without .off() first
[11:35:24] <robertmaxrees> saml http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ya6kz0bk/
[11:35:28] <robertmaxrees> retuyrn false is redundant.
[11:35:33] <robertmaxrees> for what you want, at least.
[11:36:49] <s2013> hello. so i have this weird situation. i am adding a class to a button after a form is submitted via ajax... it adds the class to the button.. i also have a code in place so that if anything with that class is clicked it shows an alert and prevents default.. but it doesnt do that.. but if i paste that piece of code in the dev console it works.. is that js not being bound or something
[11:37:07] <robertmaxrees> s2013 it's not bound.
[11:37:12] <robertmaxrees> because the class doesn't exist until later.
[11:37:29] <s2013> yeah so what is the solution
[11:37:31] <robertmaxrees> you need a delegated listener - $('parent').on('click', '.yourClass', function() {});
[11:37:39] <robertmaxrees> where 'parent' is a node that exists on pageload.
[11:37:42] <s2013> oh
[11:40:06] <arc_> it's kinda amusing how often that problem comes up
[11:40:13] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:40:28] <robertmaxrees> heh.  not surprising necessarily, just funny.
[11:40:33] <s2013> hilarious
[11:40:41] <s2013> but still wotn work. let me paste the code
[11:40:45] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[11:40:49] <robertmaxrees> because that should work just fine.
[11:41:44] <s2013> https://gist.github.com/ss2k/f2ddcfb608d07e44adc9
[11:41:57] <s2013> sorry have a bit of ruby mixed in the html but should be straight forward
[11:42:21] <s2013> then in the ajax response it adds the render_invites class and when i inspect the element, its there
[11:42:50] <robertmaxrees> right - so us this entire UL pulled in via ajax?
[11:42:54] <robertmaxrees> including .nav-buttons?
[11:43:14] <s2013> $(".hp-back").addClass("render_invites")
[11:43:19] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i asked.
[11:43:23] <s2013> thats in the ajax response
[11:43:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:43:40] <robertmaxrees> what data are yopu pulling back via ajax?
[11:43:41] <s2013> like i mean after the ajax is successful thats how the class is being added
[11:43:51] <s2013> nothing.. it just submits an ajax request to a form
[11:44:07] <arc_> when he said "a parent" he meant somewhere higher in the hierarchy, not the direct parent. the element you bind has to exist when the page loads
[11:44:14] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:44:17] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'm getting at.
[11:44:22] <s2013> the nav exists when the page loads
[11:44:35] <robertmaxrees> and doesn't get replaced or anything?
[11:44:38] <s2013> nope
[11:44:40] <arc_> are you binding a class that it didn't have when the page loaded
[11:44:53] <robertmaxrees> and this is in a document ready/after the relevant html?
[11:44:53] <s2013> yeah arc_ the render_invites class
[11:44:57] <s2013> yep
[11:45:13] <robertmaxrees> could you paste the rendered htm,l for the nav?
[11:45:17] <s2013> hold on
[11:46:26] <s2013> https://gist.github.com/ss2k/f41271681af7ff844e3c
[11:46:30] <s2013> so there is the before and after
[11:46:44] <robertmaxrees> i don't see the .render-invites anywhere.
[11:46:55] <robertmaxrees> ah the first one.
[11:47:02] <s2013> yeah in the after
[11:47:17] <robertmaxrees> something isn't adding up then. that listener should work.
[11:47:19] <robertmaxrees> try binding to document.
[11:47:26] <s2013> ok
[11:47:41] <s2013> so $(document).on('click', 'render_invites', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); ... }); ?
[11:47:52] <s2013> .render_invites *
[11:47:53] <arc_> .render_invites
[11:47:54] <robertmaxrees> $(document).on('click', .render_invites', function() {}); - if that works, then .nav-buttons doesn't exist when you think it does.
[11:48:19] <s2013> ok
[11:48:41] <robertmaxrees> make sure you add a console.log() to make sure the handler fires.
[11:48:43] <s2013> yeah that worked.. i woner why
[11:48:51] <s2013> cause im not doing anything with the nav-buttons
[11:48:57] <robertmaxrees> .nav-buttons doesn't exist when you think it does.
[11:49:09] <robertmaxrees> what does your doc ready look like?
[11:49:23] <arc_> maybe there's something wrong with the html and somehow the anchor is not a child of the div he's binding
[11:49:42] <robertmaxrees> his markup looks clean in the samples he provided.
[11:49:48] <s2013> lots of shitty js.. its basically an old app  we ar ejust adding a new ui to
[11:50:10] <robertmaxrees> something tells me that element is dynamically added or gets removed and re-added or something weird like that.
[11:50:13] <s2013> so i am doing my best to clean it upa s much as i can but there are like tons of js..luckily all the errors/warnings are gone
[11:50:53] <arc_> well afaik there's not much of a drawback to binding document with a delegated listener, as long as you don't create another element somewhere else that matches the selector
[11:51:01] <s2013> ill try binding it to just main div
[11:51:11] <arc_> that would also be fine
[11:51:16] <robertmaxrees> arc_ you avoid doing that because otherwise you're filtering every time that event occurs.
[11:51:26] <robertmaxrees> instead of scoping it to a more relevant place.
[11:51:36] <robertmaxrees> it's also kind of hard to troubleshoot.,
[11:51:38] <arc_> oh right, the filtering part
[11:51:56] <arc_> i was thinking just because events propogate to the document level anyway
[11:52:30] <s2013> k binding it to the #main div works too. illj ust leave it that way
[11:52:37] <s2013> this page is only used once by members anyways
[12:03:21] <bwen> is moving chunk of html within the dom only slow on a massive scale? If we are moving chunk of js only for page transition it shouldnt be that bad right?
[12:06:11] <saml> http://jsfiddle.net/ya6kz0bk/3/  how can I reliably prevent following link? I don't have control over 3rd party click tracking library
[12:22:31] <saml> is there selector for child of a?
[12:22:47] <saml> a > *
[12:23:47] <saml> $('a > *').off('click')   this doesn't do
[12:27:02] <saml> $('a  *').off('click')   this does it
[12:28:27] <robertmaxrees> > is "direct child"
[12:31:05] <robertmaxrees> saml why are you trying to break your click tracking?
[12:32:20] <saml> this tool (bookmarklet) gives user ability to edit things in place. and even after contenteditable=true, when user clicks the editable element again, it follows link
[12:32:28] <saml> http://jsfiddle.net/ya6kz0bk/7/  solution :P
[12:33:03] <robertmaxrees> so then why are you using the bookmarklet?
[12:33:23] <FearDread> interesting fiddle
[12:33:36] <saml> i don't know. just got a bug ticket assigned to me. not really familiar with this tool
[12:33:53] <robertmaxrees> welp
[12:34:08] <saml> maintainer is out on vacation
[12:34:14] <saml> i don't even know javascript well
[12:34:17] <robertmaxrees> oh so it's an internal tool
[12:34:17] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:34:24] <saml> yah
[12:34:32] <robertmaxrees> fix the tool then.
[12:34:36] <robertmaxrees> instead of monkey-patching.
[12:34:36] <saml> jquery is so useful
[12:34:39] <ngharo> RIP puppy
[12:34:39] <robertmaxrees> good learning experience.
[12:36:29] <FearDread> jquery is the ultimate
[12:36:35] <saml> actually, not a solution. that breaks entire edit-in-place functionality. need to study the tool more

[13:13:34] <cek> This is a weird issue. I load stuff via ajax and supply it to html(stuff). Now , it seems jquery pageless doesn't work this way on second load. It works on first load, though.
[13:13:42] <cek> What could be the problem?
[13:25:32] <jaguar|2> I have a form in a div, which I want hidden, but to show it and animate it to its full height when [ Show form ] is clicked
[13:25:57] <jaguar|2> currently, it shows, but it overlaps the material below it on the page
[13:26:16] <jaguar|2> (because its original style was:  display:none; height:0px)
[13:27:39] <jaguar|2> I guess, if it's hidden, I could leave its height automatically set.. but then how to set that to 0, show(), and animate it to its full proper height?
[13:30:22] <Zzaichik> could probably handle it with CSS Transitions. add/remove classname on click
[13:30:25] <jaguar|2> I'd use var height=$("#box").height()?  then how do I get that value into my animate() properties?
[13:30:53] <Zzaichik> you can't have a var named "height"
[13:31:27] <jaguar|2> good to know :)
[13:31:43] <Zzaichik> var h = $('#box').height();    .animate({ 'height': h }, speed);
[13:34:11] <jaguar|2> working on it :)  thank you
[13:34:29] <Zzaichik> I would recommend using CSS, and then add/remove class name
[13:36:14] <jaguar|2> looking into css transitions too... that's nice.. thanks :)
[13:36:26] <Zzaichik> yeah that would be ideal. yw :)
[13:36:39] <jaguar|2> then I don't need to worry about google hijacking my webpage if I link to their jquery!
[13:40:47] <jaguar|2> Zzaichik: I was actually working on a modal popup, which I still think would be nicer, but I've been unhappy with, or unable to get working, any I've found so far
[13:41:16] <jaguar|2> (and I have an unhealthy dislike for additional dependencies in my projects)
[13:45:29] <jaguar|2> this computer is at ie8 (although I'm in firefox generally)... trying to find ie10 to go to..
[13:45:42] <jaguar|2> can't go to 11 apparently, as it's not compatible with my asus t101mt
[13:46:01] <jaguar|2> ...maybe once I get the service pack to install properly
[13:48:59] <jaguar|2> Zzaichik: compatibility is of high importance, by the way, as the site is visited by people around the world.. young and old, rich and poor
[13:49:16] <jaguar|2> looks like css transitions require ie10+
[13:52:36] <jaguar|2> (fyi, the example on this page does work with my ie8) http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_transition5
[14:08:20] <jaguar|2> bb..  installing sp1 :)
[14:20:29] <Zzaichik> Ah. Yeah that sucks. well, back to .animate() I guess.
[14:41:23] <NeedSomeHelp> Hi I am confused about my jquery cookie value. I have a top menu at http://www.cirithungol.org/artist/john-doane. If you click on the X on the right, I want it to remember the state. It seems to randomly forget it's state. If you click the X to close the menu, and refresh, it will probably remember it. If you go to another page on the same site, it will probably forget it.

[16:09:33] <Felishia> hello :3
[16:10:08] <Felishia> if I :o have an element and another element and I want to copy the events from one to other, how do I do?
[16:10:20] <Felishia> considering I don't know previously what events were attatched
[16:10:24] <Felishia> using jquery 2.x
[16:13:25] <snover> Felishia: you should consider a different way of doing whatever it is you are trying to do
[16:16:21] <Felishia> snover, that's the only way it works
[16:16:46] <snover> you should reconsider that belief
[16:17:18] <Felishia> it'd be something different if done differently
[16:51:06] <ubuntuisloved_> I have a side menu using bootstrap tabs. One of the menu items is projects. The project tab has a list of projects. I want to have a few screens accessible only if you click a button from the projects list screen. Basically hidden from view until the user hits the button
