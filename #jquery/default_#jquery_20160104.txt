[01:35:32] <norc> Hi, what is an appropriate way to register jQuery handlers when you cannot ensure that jQuery is already loaded when your code is called?
[01:35:37] <norc> Plain DOMContentLoaded?
[01:40:35] <norc> Or I guess the load event is enough. Nevermind.
[01:50:20] <dopie> Hey guys I have a question with my fiddle, i called .hide() on rotateText does fadeIn remove or overwrite the hide??
[03:06:33] <hellyeah> hey anyone around
[03:07:22] <hellyeah> i want to add a div to the another div but i want to add it as first child of parent div. Is that possible to do?  http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/90/
[03:11:00] <hellyeah> prepend worked
[03:11:03] <hellyeah> good
[03:38:11] <jquery998> hello?
[04:44:58] <raskel> hey guys, i want to be sure... is it possible to have a <tr id="val">... some <td> inside it, and some "generic" classes ( appears in each tr with the same name ). Example: <tr id="6"><td><input class="Device"/></td><td><input class="SomethingElse"/></td></tr> ... if i have an event on ".Device" class, could i always get the id of his "parent"?
[04:55:13] <norc> raskel: Why not?
[04:58:36] <norc> raskel: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes
[04:58:50] <norc> Refer to this excellent sheet to get an overview of the attributes we use.
[04:59:10] <norc> You will see that both id and class are so called "global" attributes.
[05:00:43] <norc> And class is not unique (which is why CSS is practically centered around this attribute).
[05:10:05] <Shubhu> Hi I am shubhendu and I am new to open source and I want to contribute towards open source
[05:15:06] <raskel> norc, thank you !
[06:32:48] <dimi1947> I have a div which has this data attribute:data-apid="26"..how am i going to target it to remove it from the DOM...I tried this without result:  $( "div" ).data( "apid" )==apID.remove();  apID is variable which holds the number 26
[06:34:16] <norc> dimi1947: What are you trying to do exactly? Remove the div from the dom tree?
[06:34:45] <dimi1947> norc...yes the div with the specific data attribute
[06:34:48] <norc> dimi1947: https://api.jquery.com/has-attribute-selector/
[06:35:41] <hellyeah> when you drop button onto anther button new div is created and closebutton is apending there. But line 33-35 didnt work why is that.  http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/93/
[06:36:08] <norc> dimi1947: If you need to select with a specific data attribute, you can also use this: https://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[06:36:58] <dimi1947> norc...thanks I will try to apply it now
[06:37:22] <norc> hellyeah: Because no element satisfies the selector.
[06:38:17] <norc> Oh wait!
[06:39:38] <hellyeah> you sure?
[06:39:47] <hellyeah> there is .boxclose still
[06:40:20] <hellyeah> seems like there is
[06:40:34] <norc> hellyeah: I really dont have much experience with jsfiddle, but Id guess you are not registering the event listener on DOM ready.
[06:40:47] <norc> Yeah that was just me being silly, ignore that first remark.
[06:40:51] <norc> ;-)
[06:41:56] <hellyeah> norc:
[06:42:00] <norc> hellyeah: Oh yeah, it has to do with event propagation and your event listener somehow,
[06:42:01] <hellyeah> scroll down in result panel
[06:42:09] <hellyeah> you will see the boxclose there
[06:42:15] <hellyeah> boxclose work in body
[06:43:13] <norc> hellyeah: you need to use event delegation, because you are dynamically creating new dom nodes.
[06:43:23] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:43:31] <hellyeah> like
[06:43:33] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:44:03] <hellyeah> $('.boxclose').bind('click', functionname);
[06:44:11] <hellyeah> ?
[06:44:22] <norc> hellyeah: No.
[06:44:33] <norc> hellyeah: Think about how events work in JavaScript, and how event handlers work.
[06:44:57] <hellyeah> event is worked when you do certain action
[06:46:05] <norc> hellyeah: Your event handler is installed when the dom is ready, which means it only applies to those nodes that satisfied that condition during DOM ready.
[06:46:10] <norc> Which is the empty button at the end.
[06:46:23] <norc> When you *afterwards* clone it, it doesn't work because it has no event listener.
[06:46:47] <norc> hellyeah: https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[06:46:49] <norc> Take a read at this.
[06:47:02] <hellyeah> than

[06:52:36] <sigdk> Hello, I'm trying to reproduce this: https://datatables.net/examples/api/row_details.html here: https://jsfiddle.net/485ed4kz/  nevertheless it doesn't function properly... any hints ?
[06:53:05] <sigdk> There is also a tab with AJAX code at the first url that I don't know what to do with
[07:02:11] <norc> sigdk: I dont think there is a simple way to do this with loading the data through ajax in jsfiddle.
[07:03:52] <norc> sigdk: You will have to use this method: https://www.datatables.net/examples/data_sources/js_array.html
[07:09:22] <doonie> hi, how does one go about selecting a named array? http://puu.sh/mjb4Y/d9917b1b85.png eg li#shops[3] ?
[07:12:22] <doonie> ah quotes <3
[07:16:52] <norc> doonie: Unable to see your page from my provider restrictions. Can you gist/fiddle the relevant part?
[07:20:04] <doonie> It's ok, found out by bruteforce ;D thx norc
[07:25:47] <ailaG> I need an opinion on best practices. I have 2 JS files: One for the site/app, gets graph data. One just for drawing the graphs. There’s a button in the dom that needs to be disabled if there’s no graph data. Only the first file knows the DOM but doing the same try/catch or if/else for every call seems redundant
[07:26:57] <ailaG> TL;DR somewhat: file 1 has the dom and calls drawGraph(). file 2 draws graphs. I need to change the same part in DOM when there’s no data for drawGraph.
[07:49:37] <hellyeah> hey
[07:49:50] <hellyeah> found something interesting may be a bug in jquery droppable and draggable
[07:49:56] <hellyeah> do you want to hear it?
[07:52:54] <hellyeah> if you dont specify axis of draggable line 18 when  you transfer button from droppablediv to another droppable div. Positioning is kinda obscurre but if you enable axis:y there is no problem about positioning http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/100/
[08:00:51] <doonie> hellyeah:  just report it as a bug on the bugtracker mate :)
[08:01:34] <hellyeah> but i am not sure it is really a bug i asked because i want to make sure but let me report it
[08:01:57] <hellyeah> can i write my report with jsfiddle example and with some screenshot
[08:01:58] <hellyeah> ?
[08:02:15] <doonie> yeah you sure can, then they can confirm it there or not
[08:02:27] <hellyeah> okey
[08:02:34] <doonie> not many have the time to go deep into the code here, most idle and just try to help when they get a spare second at work
[08:03:18] <hellyeah> ic
[08:03:24] <hellyeah> i will keep it in my mind
[08:03:31] <hellyeah> letme ask a question
[08:03:43] <hellyeah> when you type something and hit the enter
[08:03:54] <hellyeah> is there an event that saves the contant to that input box
[08:07:39] <doonie> as in if the content of the input box is saved somewhere?
[08:22:38] <hellyeah> doonie: yes
[08:22:44] <hellyeah> doonie: sec
[08:23:44] <hellyeah> doonie: type smt here https://jsfiddle.net/7exdam2r/ and it is saved automatically or when i hit enter
[08:23:49] <hellyeah> is it possible?
[08:24:31] <hellyeah> may be type smt to input box
[08:24:44] <hellyeah> and when i hit enter it become something else that holds the text
[08:27:38] <jw4000> can someone tell me how i can pass a function into jquery plugin option object and run the function within the plugin?
[08:27:40] <doonie> yeah you can save it to a local variable, if that is what you want
[08:30:41] <jw4000> anyone?
[08:31:05] <hellyeah> but it will apear in that box
[08:31:10] <hellyeah> is that possible
[08:31:31] <hellyeah> when i refresh the ppage it will appear in that box
[08:31:48] <hellyeah> btw there is more then once input box
[08:32:01] <hellyeah> i will think to create ten input box
[08:32:46] <hellyeah> doonie think about this https://jsfiddle.net/7exdam2r/2/
[08:33:00] <hellyeah> i will type something to all of them
[08:33:09] <hellyeah> and it will belong to spesific input box
[08:33:15] <hellyeah> like a title of something
[08:33:18] <hellyeah> title of div
[08:33:42] <hellyeah> there is siz seperate divs
[08:33:45] <hellyeah> six*
[08:33:52] <hellyeah> and each of div will have a name
[08:34:04] <hellyeah> to tell what this div is for
[08:34:33] <doonie> you can always store data in cookie
[08:34:37] <doonie> to keep it in between sessions
[08:35:09] <doonie> or html5 local storage
[08:35:40] <hellyeah> html5 local storage seems more useful
[08:35:51] <hellyeah> let me search for it
[08:37:19] <hellyeah> doonie: what about this https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage
[08:37:42] <doonie> local storage yes
[08:40:00] <hellyeah> does it make sense https://jsfiddle.net/7exdam2r/3/ ?
[08:41:12] <doonie> missing the whole enter part though :)
[08:46:53] <hellyeah> enter part
[08:46:57] <hellyeah> what dfo you mean?
[08:47:45] <doonie> the javascript to catch your enter key
[08:47:59] <doonie> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2335553/jquery-how-to-catch-enter-key-and-change-event-to-tab
[08:48:22] <hellyeah> thanks
[08:48:30] <hellyeah> that help me a lot i am sure of it
[08:49:21] <hellyeah> actually at the end of the day
[08:49:30] <hellyeah> i will get all body into json
[08:49:37] <hellyeah> i have some elements
[08:49:51] <hellyeah> but for saving text into input box
[08:49:57] <hellyeah> i have to use localstorage

[10:13:55] <bellez> hello everyone. is there anyone who could take a minute and help me out with a problem I'm having with my code?
[10:15:00] <taplar> just ask.  if anyone can they'll pipe in, :)
[10:15:16] <wa5ted> taplar: or tap in for that matter :P
[10:15:35] <taplar> lol, da dum chi!
[10:16:25] <taplar> but yeah, it's a support/help chatroom.  questions are expected :)
[10:16:37] <wa5ted> bellez: ask away
[10:16:45] <bellez> ok, so I have areas in my code where I'm outputting a number. I need to be able to take those numbers from the code and add them together to check to see if they are less than a different number stored in a variable.
[10:17:50] <bellez> However when i try to do result = $('.result'); and then try to out put just one of the many parts of the array that is given by doing result[0].text() says that it isn't a function.
[10:18:08] <taplar> your breaking out of jquery with [0]
[10:18:14] <taplar> use eq(0)
[10:18:29] <taplar> text() is a jquery method so you have to operate off of a jquery object
[10:18:36] <bellez> ok
[10:19:13] <bellez> THANK YOU! That worked :)
[10:40:39] <_TWG_> Can anyone help me with consuming 12 CSV files to take the data and use with my Angular project?
[10:42:15] <taplar> maybe try #angular
[10:42:43] <_TWG_> Thanks taplar I'm on there as well and it doesn't seem like anyone is active so that's why I was trying here as well.
[10:43:01] <neha>  Can anybody tell me what method do we use to scroll to certain part of a website by clicking on an option on navbar?
[10:43:26] <taplar> neha:actual scroll or just go to?
[10:43:50] <neha>  go to.
[10:44:09] <taplar> you can do that without javascript.  that's just an inpage link
[10:44:12] <neha> like one page websites
[10:44:35] <_TWG_> then you won't want to do a typical inpage link
[10:44:45] <neha> http://www.mycookroom.ru/mywork/Leaff/Leaff-v1.4/Site/index.html
[10:45:00] <neha> please have a look at this template
[10:45:11] <neha> click on different options in navbar
[10:45:36] <_TWG_> They use smoothscroll.js
[10:46:26] <neha> ohh.. :) Ohkay let me try then :)
[10:46:26] <neha> thanks.
[10:46:29] <taplar> man, still loading for me
[10:47:00] <neha> arh!google fonts.
[10:47:31] <DelphiWorld> SUP all
[10:47:37] <DelphiWorld> happy new jquery year, #FF all
[10:47:42] <taplar> monday dude
[10:47:44] <_TWG_> neha sorry it's actually scrollspy
[10:47:53] <km4> neha: navbar use only bootstrap scroll.js
[10:48:37] <neha> confused!
[10:48:47] <neha> scrollspy?
[10:48:52] <taplar> there's also scrollTop() which you can use to scroll the page
[10:49:06] <taplar> you'd need to find the placement of the element to scroll to as a parameter
[10:49:18] <taplar> https://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[10:49:44] <neha> yea. I got the answer.
[10:49:49] <neha> thank you so much.
[10:49:53] <neha> :)
[10:50:09] <taplar> i like the page background
[10:51:01] <neha> i have just made the static template page.
[10:51:16] <neha> trying to add js.
[10:51:39] <neha> tedious job for a begineer.
[10:51:54] <neha> beginner*
[10:52:14] <km4> taplar: its right :) jquery only and css :)
[10:54:33] <DelphiWorld> $('#vctl').value(localStorage.getItem('volume'));
[10:54:36] <DelphiWorld> am i correct here?
[10:54:45] <DelphiWorld> retrieving volume value from a local storage
[10:54:52] <taplar> looks syntatically correct
[10:54:54] <taplar> oh
[10:54:55] <DelphiWorld> and saving here:    localStorage.setItem('volume', media.volume);
[10:54:55] <taplar> val()
[10:55:18] <DelphiWorld> taplar:  so: $('#vctl').val(localStorage.getItem('volume'));
[10:55:22] <taplar> yeah
[10:57:07] <DelphiWorld> taplar: and this? correct? media.volume(localStorage.getItem('volume'));
[10:58:20] <taplar> maybe, not sure what media.volume is
[10:58:33] <DelphiWorld> media is a audio object
[10:58:50] <taplar> oh, you may have issues.  iirc, localStorage/sessionStorage only stores strings
[10:59:06] <taplar> it's similar to cookies in that aspect
[10:59:13] <DelphiWorld> lol, taplar ! can't store a number?
[10:59:24] <taplar> it will convert it to a string i believe
[10:59:38] <DelphiWorld> ;)
[10:59:42] <DelphiWorld> lol
[10:59:45] <DelphiWorld> let's try
[11:02:01] <DelphiWorld> taplar: lol... media.volume(localStorage.getItem('volume')); giving: media.volume is not a function
[11:02:17] <DelphiWorld> media.volume=localStorage.getItem('volume');
[11:02:19] <DelphiWorld> i think
[11:03:07] <taplar> what is volume?  a function?  cause that's what your trying to use it as.  but in the second part your assignment is not treating it as such
[11:03:27] <DelphiWorld> volume is a value
[11:03:34] <DelphiWorld> media is a audio object
[11:03:42] <taplar> so it would be = instead of volume()
[11:03:47] <km4> DelphiWorld: any jsfiddle?
[11:04:07] <DelphiWorld> km4: can't use any feedling due to screen reader uncompatibility
[11:04:21] <DelphiWorld> dudes
[11:04:23] <DelphiWorld> it works
[11:04:48] <taplar> cool
[11:05:20] <DelphiWorld> i'll show code
[11:05:54] <km4> :)
[11:09:31] <sigdk> I'm trying to apply this feature: https://datatables.net/examples/api/row_details.html  but in my case I get a "devicesTable.row is not a function"
[11:09:34] <sigdk> any hints ?
[11:17:28] <DelphiWorld> taplar:  http://paste.debian.net/359513/
[11:17:41] <DelphiWorld> the slide isn't getting the value from media.volume
[11:19:33] <taplar> where is that at?  in your head?  at the end of the body?  cause you got some stuff outside your document ready
[11:19:49] <DelphiWorld> its inside of the doc ready
[11:19:58] <DelphiWorld> all i have out of doc ready is vars
[11:20:15] <taplar> which if your executing them before the body is in the dom...
[11:20:27] <DelphiWorld> taplar: what you suggest?
[11:20:54] <taplar> if this logic is before the body, anything that looks up dom elements should be in the ready
[11:21:34] <DelphiWorld> taplar: so i put everything inside of my doc ready?
[11:21:47] <taplar> do you understand the purpose of document ready?
[11:22:06] <DelphiWorld> i thought is when is the page fully loaded
[11:22:18] <taplar> not entirely
[11:22:50] <taplar> document ready delays the execution of the contained function until the page is parsed into the dom.  this does not mean loaded completely as images could still be loading
[11:23:11] <DelphiWorld> i understand now
[11:23:18] <DelphiWorld> so where should i retrieve my localstorage?
[11:23:30] <taplar> if you attempt to look up a dom element prior to it being created in the markup, it will not find it.  so the delay is necessary if your putting your logic before the body markup.
[11:23:39] <taplar> if you put your logic at the end of the body you don't need the document ready at all
[11:23:55] <DelphiWorld> my script is loaded after the body
[11:24:17] <taplar> ok, so you really don't have to have the ready if you don't care to
[11:24:44] <DelphiWorld> taplar: good. but still the slider (vctl) isn't getting the value from the media.volume
[11:24:57] <DelphiWorld> see this one: media.volume=localStorage.getItem('volume');
[11:25:00] <DelphiWorld> this onne work
[11:25:09] <DelphiWorld> but: $('#vctl').value=media.volume*100; dont work
[11:25:30] <taplar> according to the mdn docs, volume range is 0-1
[11:25:45] <taplar> it's a decimal value
[11:25:53] <taplar> 0.0 - 1.0
[11:25:57] <DelphiWorld> yep
[11:26:06] <DelphiWorld> so i am multiplying it
[11:26:07] <taplar> so * 100 is weird
[11:26:30] <DelphiWorld> taplar: i change volume like this:     $('#cast').prop("volume", this.value/100);
[11:26:35] <DelphiWorld> where this is the slider
[11:26:53] <sigdk> I need help. What do lines 40 & 41 do here: https://datatables.net/examples/api/row_details.html ?
[11:26:56] <taplar> what is the range of this.value?
[11:27:10] <DelphiWorld> taplar: slider is from 0 to 100
[11:27:22] <taplar> ok, so why are you then multiplying it?
[11:27:25] <sigdk> I'm trying to apply the same concept, but I get function not found when I call .row()
[11:27:48] <DelphiWorld> taplar: cause media.volume is 0.0 to 1.0, no?
[11:27:53] <taplar> yep
[11:28:12] <DelphiWorld> taplar: am i correct so?
[11:28:23] <taplar> 50 would be changed to 0.5, but then your multiplying it with 100 which changes it back to 50 which exceeds the volume range
[11:28:37] <DelphiWorld> taplar: lol
[11:28:48] <DelphiWorld> i think you're confused
[11:28:51] <taplar> ah, nvm
[11:28:56] <taplar> different variable, ^_^
[11:29:07] <taplar> fricken mondays
[11:29:20] <DelphiWorld> i save it in the localstorage from media object so its 0.5, but when i retrieve it i should do 0.5*100 so it should be 50 and assign it to the slider object
[11:30:04] <taplar> ok do a console log where you retrieve it and see what you get.  if you get 0.5, do a console log of typeof localStorage.getItem(...) and see what that prints
[11:30:27] <DelphiWorld> taplar: i use only alert to get values ;)
[11:30:44] <taplar> prefer console.log.  alert freezes your js execution
[11:30:59] <taplar> and can lead to misunderstands in regards to timing issues
[11:38:18] <subsonic> any good recommended templating systems?
[11:39:15] <taplar> you might checkout handlebars.js
[11:39:48] <NoiseEee> i dig mustache
[11:42:44] <DelphiWorld> strange...
[11:46:45] <subsonic> taplar: yeah, I've looked into handlebars.  It's decent.
[12:00:13] <marrenarre> taplar: HTML5 Local Storage can only store strings AFAIK.
[12:00:27] <duch_kazatel> those strings can be JSON.
[12:00:30] <duch_kazatel> which can be anything you wnat.
[12:00:50] <taplar> i said that earlier
[12:02:06] <marrenarre> Even if the string is valid JSON, it's still a string. Why would typeof localStorage.getItem('thing') not return 'string'?
[12:02:16] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[12:02:21] <duch_kazatel> you parse the JSON back out.
[12:02:58] <duch_kazatel> and it does return a string.
[12:03:09] <marrenarre> "do a console log of typeof localStorage.getItem(...)"
[12:03:24] <duch_kazatel> what are you getting instead?
[12:04:33] <marrenarre> I am asking why you would want to do that since it should always be 'string'.
[12:04:36] <taplar> sometimes you have to see it to believe it.  console logging it can do that, :)
[12:04:38] <marrenarre> Or 'object' if it's not set.
[12:05:33] <taplar> and if it is a string, which it should be, multiplying by a number may have unintended results.  which is another reason to console log it
[12:05:40] <duch_kazatel> ^
[12:05:52] <duch_kazatel> sounds like there's some confusion about localstorage.
[12:06:10] <marrenarre> But of course it's a string and not a number if you just retrieve it with .getItem.
[12:06:15] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: yep, help me?
[12:06:44] <subsonic> if I want to build a SPA app, should I do it in just jQuery?
[12:06:46] <taplar> marrenarre:of course
[12:07:00] <taplar> subsonic:depends, how big of a site?
[12:07:03] <NoiseEee> subsonic: you should probably use a framework that specializes in such thing really
[12:07:09] <DelphiWorld> taplar: console sadly dont work with screen reader
[12:07:27] <NoiseEee> console.log should be used by developers, not end users
[12:07:43] <NoiseEee> otherwise they can be used/inferred for attack vectors etc
[12:07:57] <NoiseEee> nothing should make it into production writing things to console
[12:07:58] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld i'm not the only person available to help you ;)
[12:08:19] <subsonic> taplar / NoiseEee : Yeah. but which one.  There seems to be so many opinions and learning curves.    The site is probably around 10 pages some with lists/search
[12:08:37] <DelphiWorld> subsonic: mobile targetted?
[12:08:45] <taplar> i'd have to defer that question.
[12:08:53] <DelphiWorld> lol
[12:08:57] <DelphiWorld> jquery mobile is good
[12:09:09] <duch_kazatel> subsonic there are a lot of choices - it's all about what features you'll need.
[12:09:42] <DelphiWorld> taplar: see now:    localStorage.setItem('volume', this.value); where "this" is a slider
[12:09:47] <DelphiWorld> so no more *100
[12:09:50] <subsonic> I wouldn't say it's mobile targeted.
[12:10:01] <DelphiWorld> and this: $('#vctl').value=localStorage.getItem('volume');
[12:10:05] <DelphiWorld> but its not getting it
[12:10:12] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld because that's not a valid thing.
[12:10:15] <taplar> DelphiWorld:i wasn't leading towards not doing * 100 if that's what you need
[12:10:23] <duch_kazatel> $('#vctl').val(localStorage.getItem('volume'));
[12:10:35] <taplar> but the string value should be parsed first if you have to do that operation
[12:10:59] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: trying it
[12:12:17] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld you really need to do a tutorial - with jquery, you never really do .propname=anything
[12:12:27] <duch_kazatel> it's always through a method of some kind
[12:12:55] <NoiseEee> subsonic: I'd say check out React/Flux, Angular and Ember to start, but React/Flux has all the hotness of late and people like it
[12:13:02] <duch_kazatel> ^
[12:13:23] <subsonic> ok, I looked into reacta  bit, it seemed complicated
[12:13:40] <subsonic> Went pretty far with CanJS but it's buggy
[12:13:41] <NoiseEee> subsonic: anything will require a pretty good learning curve
[12:13:45] <duch_kazatel> subsonic there's a learning curve, but you'll have that with pretty much anything.
[12:13:51] <taplar> your going to have to get used to the convention with any framework
[12:14:01] <NoiseEee> subsonic: but in the end you'll have nice organization and extendibility etc
[12:14:08] <Kitu> hello, What can I use for String.prototype.normalize() work on safari?
[12:14:58] <duch_kazatel> Kitu https://github.com/walling/unorm
[12:15:09] <Kitu> yes but on client-side ?
[12:15:17] <Kitu> not with node.js ...
[12:15:19] <duch_kazatel> Kitu search for polyfills.
[12:15:34] <Kitu> what mean "polyfill" ? :/
[12:15:43] <subsonic> NoiseEee: When working with react, is the JSX preferred?
[12:15:44] <duch_kazatel> something that fills in missing behavior.
[12:16:18] <Kitu> ok
[12:20:07] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: thanks
[12:20:15] <DelphiWorld> its retreiving the value
[12:20:24] <DelphiWorld> but now the volume isn't changing: http://paste.debian.net/359529/
[12:20:33] <NoiseEee> subsonic: not sure what the kids are using more these days, i'd check out an IRC or Slack channel
[12:21:28] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld i have no idea what you changed...
[12:21:34] <taplar> $('#vctl').value
[12:21:42] <DelphiWorld> yes
[12:21:44] <taplar> jQuery.val() or Element.value
[12:21:54] <taplar> choose one, :P
[12:22:07] <duch_kazatel> i JUST got done explaining that jquery never uses .value - you want .val() when using jquery :)
[12:22:10] <DelphiWorld> taplar: lol confused... shoot? explain
[12:22:21] <duch_kazatel> jquery doesn't have a .value, it has .val()
[12:22:31] <DelphiWorld> lol
[12:22:47] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: so you're saying this isn't jquery?     $('#cast').prop("volume", this.value/100);
[12:22:59] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld that is not what i am talking about.
[12:23:21] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: i put value and it works
[12:23:33] <DelphiWorld> if i use the object directly
[12:23:35] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld that's different from accessing .value directly.
[12:23:39] <DelphiWorld> but if i use the media variable dont work
[12:23:46] <duch_kazatel> but you donb't want to use .prop('value') - you want .val()
[12:24:04] <duch_kazatel> taplar just explained to you your problem though - you're trying to use .value=something still
[12:24:43] <duch_kazatel> if you're using jquery, you cannot use .value=something
[12:24:56] <taplar> unless you break out, which is just unnecessary work
[12:25:08] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: even this dont work; media.volume=$('#vctl').val/100;
[12:25:14] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld ...
[12:25:15] <taplar> val is a function
[12:25:21] <DelphiWorld> oh
[12:25:24] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld because it's $('someObject').val(something);
[12:25:30] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/val/
[12:25:48] <taplar> and for clarity you should probably parse it
[12:25:57] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: and to do this one properly like you suggested?     $('#cast').prop("volume", this.value/100);
[12:26:08] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld we're not talking about that.
[12:34:37] * DelphiWorld is still stuck
[12:35:12] <duch_kazatel> on?
[12:35:29] <DelphiWorld> on  changing  the volume
[12:35:47] <DelphiWorld> yay! duch_kazatel worked
[12:36:01] <taplar_food> he always functions
[12:36:27] <taplar_food> function duch_kazatel() { return "working"; }
[12:36:36] <DelphiWorld> lol
[12:39:43] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: $('#cast').prop("volume", $('#vctl').val()/100); ;)
[12:40:10] <duch_kazatel> that won't work.
[12:40:21] <duch_kazatel> you need to parse $('#vctl').val()
[12:40:22] <DelphiWorld> it work, duch_kazatel ;)
[12:40:30] <DelphiWorld> it worked auto
[12:40:37] <duch_kazatel> you should still parse it.
[12:40:43] <duch_kazatel> .val() returns a string.
[12:40:50] <duch_kazatel> relying on type coercion is never a good idea.
[12:41:16] <DelphiWorld> how to parce so?
[12:41:32] <duch_kazatel> you're doing it in a few other places in what you sent out.
[12:45:50] <DelphiWorld> is there a way to get the index of the selected item in a select list?
[12:46:03] <duch_kazatel> that's a strange item.
[12:46:05] <duch_kazatel> why do you need that?
[12:46:27] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel:  to save the current selected track in a local storage value
[12:46:39] <duch_kazatel> save the value of the select list then.
[12:46:46] <duch_kazatel> that value should have what you need.
[12:47:09] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: so it should be auto selected if i retrieve it?
[12:47:24] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[12:47:31] <DelphiWorld> hold on
[12:47:36] <taplar_food> he's just saying don't rely on positions
[12:47:37] <duch_kazatel> you're asking two different questions.
[12:47:44] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to set or retrieve the value for a select?
[12:48:05] <DelphiWorld> save it in a local storage then retrieve it on the page load and set it on the list
[12:48:19] <duch_kazatel> you can set the value for a select by using .val()
[12:48:37] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: let me try
[12:59:07] <DelphiWorld> 10000 thanks to taplar_food & duch_kazatel
[12:59:16] <taplar_food> bit excessive...
[12:59:29] <DelphiWorld> taplar_food: more will come
[12:59:32] <taplar_food> lol
[13:03:12] <DelphiWorld> any place where i could find html5 media object metthods & propertys?
[13:03:44] <taplar_food> uh, it's just html
[13:03:47] <taplar_food> and try mdn
[13:03:53] <DelphiWorld> going there
[13:04:25] <km4> DelphiWorld: you use any script for this objects ?
[13:04:40] <DelphiWorld> km4: jquery, yes
[13:05:02] <km4> any lib ?
[13:05:02] <DelphiWorld> km4:     if (media.paused) {}
[13:05:14] <DelphiWorld> where media is a variable
[13:05:21] <DelphiWorld> var media= document.getElementById("cast");
[13:05:49] <sigdk> http://paste.debian.net/359539/
[13:06:12] <sigdk> hello, is there any way to refer to foo instead of using 'foo' ?
[13:06:27] <sigdk> I want the 'outer reference of this'  (?)
[13:06:55] <taplar_food> you can just use foo
[13:07:00] <taplar_food> it's still in scope
[13:07:14] <taplar_food> make it a var though
[13:07:48] <taplar_food> otherwise it will be a global that will be overlayed with different click events
[13:08:41] <taplar_food> your missing a closing ' on your #example selector btw
[13:08:55] <sigdk> taplar_food, instead of using foo is there different way ?
[13:09:02] <taplar_food> not really
[13:09:09] <taplar_food> inside the handler 'this' is a different thing
[13:09:14] <sigdk> ok, cause this seems like a hack
[13:09:24] <taplar_food> nope, perfectly valid
[13:27:35] <bojanlazic> Can someone help me with waypoints I've got them on site but when I used .map() something got wrong, check the site console jelypix.com/homex
[13:30:48] <skinux> For divs that have hidden content (shown on click), does jQuery have a built-in method for showing and hiding or is it just adding/removing a class to whatever div on click?
[13:31:14] <duch_kazatel> there's hide/show, but generally you should use classes for that.
[13:32:49] <skinux> Also, is Vue.js anything like jQuery or different purpose?
[13:33:56] <duch_kazatel> MV* - solves a different problem.
[13:36:18] <km4> bb guys
[13:36:47] <shoky_> bojanlazic: you're passing a jquery object as the "element" option for the "new Waypoint" object. but it needs to be a DOM element (not a jquery object wrapping it)
[13:37:17] <shoky_> bojanlazic: also please don't ask people to look at minified code :\
[13:37:46] <bojanlazic> Oh sorry forgot about that, but you have pretty pint in console :D
[13:38:16] <shoky_> that only takes care (somewhat) of indentation.. not variable names or control structures
[13:38:25] <bojanlazic> ah yes
[13:39:00] <bojanlazic> Can you give me a suggestion on how could i fix this problem, because i'm pretty new to this
[13:39:25] <shoky_> jqueryobj[0]  add the [0]  to get the DOM element inside
[13:39:33] <shoky_> [0]  or .get(0)
[13:39:59] <shoky_> or.. use the jquery method for initializing waypoints
[13:40:23] <shoky_> $('#foo').waypoint(options)
[13:43:19] <bojanlazic> hmm i'm not sure how to refactor the code looks like this atm https://jsfiddle.net/g6f07xky/
[13:44:44] <duch_kazatel> why use $.map() there?
[13:45:06] <duch_kazatel> is [1, 2, 3] supposed to me be a jquery object?
[13:45:24] <shoky_> because he's using id's instead of a shared class :S
[13:45:46] <duch_kazatel> noooo.
[13:45:59] <duch_kazatel> var $animation = $('#animation'+ element); D:
[13:46:07] <shoky_> bojanlazic: first of all the waypoints change - https://jsfiddle.net/g6f07xky/1/
[13:46:27] <shoky_> bojanlazic:  (also you could just  do  element: $animation[0]  in your code like i told you before)
[13:47:29] <shoky_> bojanlazic: but uh. give those elements a shared class like  class="animation"  and then all you need to do instead of your whole code is:  $('.animation').waypoint({handler: function() { $(this).addClass(..) })
[13:48:11] <bojanlazic> shoky_:  oh yea then no mapping needed
[13:48:33] <shoky_> yes. that's what classes are for
[13:48:40] <bojanlazic> thanks a lot for helping me out, im pretty new so it's hard for me to get all the stuff your telling me but i'm doing my best
[13:48:47] <shoky_> np
[14:22:51] <Xentil> hello
[14:23:49] <taplar> hola
[14:24:14] <DelphiWorld> html5 audio (ogg) dont work for me in android4...!
[14:24:32] <taplar> html
[14:26:46] <DelphiWorld> <source id="ogg" src="media/01.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
[14:26:55] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld wrong channel to ask about that :)
[15:03:59] <parzo> Hi all, spent some time googling this without any luck but I want to add the following css property -webkit-filter: grayscale(1) to an image with a certain ID using the .css function but can't figure out how to handle the ()
[15:04:13] <duch_kazatel> what have you tried?
[15:04:35] <parzo> double escaping such as "-webkit-filter": "grayscale\\(1\\)"
[15:04:50] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/a/16781514/923919
[15:04:56] <duch_kazatel> also http://stackoverflow.com/a/16781582/923919
[15:05:40] <parzo> thanks duch_kazatel and apologies for my newbness
[15:05:46] <duch_kazatel> it's cool.
[15:06:27] <duch_kazatel> though really the "best" way to do it is to create a class in your stylesheet and add/remove that class, instead.
[15:16:54] <bojanlazic> Anyone from Serbia here ?
[15:17:30] <duch_kazatel> not sure what that has to do with jquery ;)
[15:18:22] <Uhkis> jquery is from a country and serbia is a country
[15:18:29] <duch_kazatel> hurr
[15:19:00] <Uhkis> clear relation!
[15:25:21] <taplar> jquery is from -a- country?
[15:25:31] <duch_kazatel> lol
[15:25:33] <duch_kazatel> here we go.
[15:29:16] <Uhkis> it did start with A man afaik
[15:29:25] <taplar> sexist...
[15:30:32] <duch_kazatel> john resig
[15:31:07] <thealphanerd> wut?
[15:31:13] <taplar> holy crap, he's here
[15:31:39] <taplar> with a....pun of a nickname?
[15:34:52] * taplar noted it was a monday.... when he alienated himself from the remainder of the jquery community
[15:39:39] <huck5> Is there any way to make a jQuery Mobile <select> menu with `data-native-menu='false'` to display as a dialog, rather than a popup..?
[15:40:00] <huck5> I really want the styling of the data-native-menu='false', but I need to display this select menu within a popup...
[15:42:49] <bellez> hey everyone... got a quick question... I am trying to add some last minute things to a project and was wondering why even when I have an input field focused does the tooltip show? I only want it to show when I hover over the input field.
[15:43:46] <taplar> probably something in the config
[15:43:54] <taplar> i believe default action is on focus
[15:44:43] <taplar> docs should have something about changing/defining that
[15:48:29] <bellez> idk why but in the docs at the very end there is an example and it doesn't show when I focus on the input.
[15:48:37] <duch_kazatel> link.
[15:51:49] <bellez> if i could I would... its part of a project that i had to sign a contract saying I cant share what I'm doing...:(
[15:52:16] <taplar> he was meaning of the example, i assume
[15:52:26] <duch_kazatel> i'm talking about the docs you're referring to.
[15:52:59] <bellez> http://api.jqueryui.com/tooltip/
[15:53:15] <bellez> very bottom of the page is an example of the tooltip...
[15:53:21] <duch_kazatel> so you're saying the tooltip doesn't show for you?
[15:54:28] <taplar> that bottom example i see it on hover and focus
[15:54:48] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/htthto26/ bellez does this work?
[15:54:50] <bellez> it shows if i hover but not if I focus... which is what I want
[15:55:24] <bellez> that is working duch_kazatel but when I have my personal code, it doesn't want to work :(
[15:55:32] <duch_kazatel> any console errors?
[15:55:43] <duch_kazatel> since we can't see the site it's almost impossible for us to help.
[15:56:36] <bellez> yeah i know just thought maybe someone had come across this issue before :(
[15:56:49] <bellez> i hate that I can't be like here is my code why isn't this working :(
[15:57:20] <duch_kazatel> well you could, but you'd have to put in some time to get us an example.
[15:57:35] <duch_kazatel> any console errors?
[15:58:26] <bellez> only thing i get in console is Use of getPreventDefault() is deprecated.  Use defaultPrevented instead. but that could be because i need to update my jquery
[15:58:43] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't worry about that.
[15:58:49] <duch_kazatel> i'll guess you have a css issue going on.
[16:01:59] <dan_j> Hi. I'm having problems with jquery validation engine where it's saying that a date is in the past, when its not.
[16:02:05] <dan_j> I've boiled it down to this line
[16:02:13] <bellez> i just deleted all the css I had associated with my tooltip and it still is doing the same thing :(
[16:02:18] <dan_j> var vdate = methods._parseDate(field.val());
[16:02:44] <duch_kazatel> bellez errr, you might be having an issue with other conflicting styles.
[16:02:47] <duch_kazatel> buuut ok.
[16:03:10] <dan_j> It seems that it's taking the field value of 01/01/2019 and the result of the parse is 12/07/1906
[16:03:24] <dan_j> Whats going on here?
[16:03:33] <bellez> what else could be affecting the tooltip? all I have is stuff associated with specific classes and ids
[16:03:45] <bellez> everything else is bootstrap that comes with laravel
[16:04:00] <duch_kazatel> bellez all the page's CSS?  also - you're mixing bootstrap and jquery ui - that worries me.
[16:04:10] <duch_kazatel> dan_j errr, is parseDate() apart of jquery validate?
[16:04:17] <duch_kazatel> dan_j it's hard to know without seeing it break.
[16:04:50] <dan_j> duch_kazatel: It came in a template. The copyright at the top says: Inline Form Validation Engine 2.6.1, jQuery plugin
[16:05:07] <bellez> i'm still new to coding... I have never used bootstrap to create tooltips before
[16:05:30] <duch_kazatel> dan_j i can't divine the rest of your code - i'd need to see a broken example :/
[16:05:46] <duch_kazatel> bellez http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tooltips
[16:06:20] <dan_j> duch_kazatel: Ok. Think you've helped anywhere. Thought that parsedate was a jquery function. Found it in the validation library.
[16:06:47] <thealphanerd> dan_j have you seen moment? that's what I use for all date parsing
[16:06:57] <duch_kazatel> thealphanerd it looks like it's internal to jquery validate.

[16:07:04] <duch_kazatel> i'm going to guess you
[16:07:13] <duch_kazatel> *you're feeding it an input in a format it's not expecting.
[16:12:22] <BalTun> here https://www.kamielenco.be/online-babyshop/product/stokke-steps-babyset-kussen-blauw/ when blue button pressed should open window with movie and should load page with shopping cart. New window opens on event hanlder function which should work on element with class "add2cart_handler". Now there 2 elements with this class and opens 2 windows, but page with cart is not loading. But if remove this class from element with id=u62, then no window will be shown
[16:12:22] <BalTun> . But it should be shown one window and should be loaded a page with shopping cart
[16:13:24] <duch_kazatel> BalTun not gonna lie - i stopped reading after the link to the full page.
[16:13:26] <duch_kazatel> what's the issue?
[16:13:46] <bellez> well duch_kazatel it is a css issue... but not sure what exactly...
[16:13:49] <duch_kazatel> "when i click x, it should do y, but z is happening instead"
[16:14:04] <duch_kazatel> bellez dunno then - #css might be able to better help in that cas.e
[16:14:18] <bellez> i think i figured it out but gonna try. Thanks for helping though :)
[16:20:08] <jak2000> hi all
[16:20:22] <jak2000> how to 'execute' a event, sample a click of the button?
[16:20:38] <duch_kazatel> possible, but should be avoided.
[16:20:55] <duch_kazatel> let me guess - you want to run a handler bound to something?
[16:25:59] <BalTun> duch_kazatel, when i click blue button, it should be new window with video opened and page should reload to shopping cart. but it is now opened 2 windows with video and page not reloading. If i will remove class "add2cart_handler" from element with id=u62, then will be one window with video opened and not reloading page to shopping cart...
[16:28:24] <BalTun> on this page: https://www.kamielenco.be/online-babyshop/product/stokke-steps-babyset-kussen-blauw/ when i click blue button, it should be new window with video opened and page should reload to shopping cart. but it is now opened 2 windows with video and page not reloading. If i will remove class "add2cart_handler" from element with id=u62, then will be one window with video opened and not reloading page to shopping cart...
[16:29:53] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you're confused about event listeners then.
[16:32:03] <_TWG_> I've got a global array that stores 12 items which each have the following: name, active (1/0), and data.  What would be the best way to display all of that data into 12 tabs?
[16:32:10] <BalTun> on list page it's works fine - element with id=u63 has a class add2cart_handler and after blue button pressed one window with video is opened and shopping cart page is loading
[16:32:55] <duch_kazatel> _TWG_ a few different ways - you can use .map() to generate a new array whose objects are strings of markup and then .join('') and .append() them somewhere.
[16:33:14] <duch_kazatel> BalTun you're asking us to go through all of your html and js to figure this out.
[16:34:05] <_TWG_> Okay.  So have the 12 tabs created ahead of time and then just append the data to each one? duch_kazatel
[16:34:22] <duch_kazatel> _TWG_ why have them ahead of time?
[16:34:26] <BalTun> on this page: https://www.kamielenco.be/online-babyshop/product/stokke-steps-babyset-kussen-blauw/ when i click blue button, it should be new window with video opened and page should reload to shopping cart. but it is now opened 2 windows with video and page not reloading. If i will remove class "add2cart_handler" from element with id=u62, then will be one window with video opened and not reloading page to shopping cart... on list page here http://www.kamie
[16:34:26] <BalTun> lenco.be/online-babyshop/category/Tripp-Trapp/ it's works fine - element with id=u63 has a class add2cart_handler and after blue button pressed one window with video is opened and shopping cart page is loading
[16:34:29] <duch_kazatel> the .map() can handle that for youi.
[16:34:43] <duch_kazatel> BalTun repeating the same thing over and over isn't going to get youhelp any faster.
[16:34:45] <_TWG_> Okay.  I guess I need to go an lookup .map()
[16:34:56] <duch_kazatel> _TWG_ it just takes an array from one format to another.
[16:35:09] <duch_kazatel> the other format could be a string - you could return markup for each item in the aray.
[16:35:39] <_TWG_> Okay.  Just pulled the specs up and reading through it.
[16:35:44] <duch_kazatel> let me show you the idea.
[16:36:15] <BalTun> duch_kazatel, sorry, i repeated after getting more clear question to see it from begin to end in one message
[16:36:24] <_TWG_> duch_kazatel: okay
[16:36:27] <duch_kazatel> BalTun that's a really big message.
[16:36:48] <duch_kazatel> BalTun you're asking us to go through your HTML and JS to help you - generally yopu'd make a standalone test case and send that instead.
[16:37:49] <BalTun> duch_kazatel, thanks, i'll try
[16:39:42] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/07yeg7nt/ _TWG_
[16:44:47] <_TWG_> Thanks duch_kazatel
[16:44:55] <jak2000> how to know the numer of items on a Select/option ?
[16:45:10] <duch_kazatel> _TWG_ if you're going to be doing a lot of that, i'd suggest looking into a templating engine
[16:45:21] <duch_kazatel> jak2000 .find('option').length
[16:45:54] <_TWG_> Well I have to give them a working demo by tomorrow morning.  I started looking at Angular today but I don't know the first thing about it so I scratched it.
[16:46:09] <duch_kazatel> angular is a fulll MV*
[16:46:14] <duch_kazatel> you just need a templating engine.
[16:46:15] <duch_kazatel> but OK.
[16:46:29] <_TWG_> Can you suggest one?
[16:46:40] <duch_kazatel> underscore has one built-in if you're already using it
[16:50:02] <_TWG_> I'm looking at mustache right nwo.
[16:50:04] <_TWG_> now
[16:50:23] <duch_kazatel> that's another options.
[16:50:25] <duch_kazatel> *option
[16:51:20] <_TWG_> Now to quickly learn it.
[16:51:29] <duch_kazatel> are you just building a proof of concept or what?>
[16:51:47] <_TWG_> yes.
[16:53:32] <duch_kazatel> then i wouldn't worry about it for now.
[16:53:34] <duch_kazatel> it's a P.O.C.
[16:54:41] <_TWG_> Okay.  I just have to show them that we can take the CSV that their vendor is writing to our web server and make a nice looking display for it.
[16:55:15] <huck5> I'm trying to create a jQuery dialog, but when I trigger it `$("#mySelector").dialog();`, it is just pushing the surround divs, rather than popping-up above them... Is this the intended behavior?
[16:55:42] <duch_kazatel> huck5 nope - sounds like you're missing a css file.
[16:55:50] <huck5> Ok!
[16:55:58] <huck5> That's a good start.  Thanks duch_kazatel
[17:03:53] <huck5> duch_kazatel, could you take a look at this fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/hfvntm37/ . This is the sort of behavior I was talking about... Also, do you know why it's not getting styled with the title and close button?
[17:04:19] <duch_kazatel> oh, sounds like a css conflict./
[17:04:35] <duch_kazatel> also: onclick is bad.
[17:05:03] <duch_kazatel> so are you trying to hide/show a dialog?
[17:05:05] <huck5> should add with .on('click', function...) isntead?
[17:05:08] <huck5> Basically, yep
[17:05:32] <huck5> I would like to use a popup, but I don't want to close my existing popup to open it... so opting to try a dialog instead.
[17:05:44] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquerymobile.com/dialog/ tells you exactly how to do that.
[17:05:53] <duch_kazatel> "You can open a dialog programmatically by calling the $.mobile.changePage method:"
[17:06:21] <duch_kazatel> and yes, use .on() for event bindings instead.
[17:06:44] <huck5> duch_kazatel, would I be able to simply replace the href with an id-selector, instead of an *.html page? E.g. `href="#myDialogId"` ?
[17:06:56] <duch_kazatel> did you read the docs?
[17:07:13] <duch_kazatel> $.mobile.changePage( "#myDialog", { role: "dialog" } );
[17:07:47] <huck5> I see it now, thanks again duch_kazatel
[17:11:06] <_TWG_> duch_kazatel: if I have an array inside of another array can I still use the .map?  Do I have to embed a secondary map?
[17:12:07] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[17:12:11] <duch_kazatel> maps in maps.
[17:19:27] <_TWG_> duch_kazatel: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/07yeg7nt/#&togetherjs=63lC8zJD4A
[17:19:42] <duch_kazatel> nothing's changed there.
[17:19:52] <duch_kazatel> trying updating, saving it, and tossing the link back out.
[17:23:30] <jak2000> http://pastie.org/10670099   <--- how to wait trigger the line: 18, and then continue with the rest of lines? exist a .done?
[17:23:32] <duch_kazatel> oooor not.
[17:23:58] <duch_kazatel> jak2000 don't use .trigger()
[17:24:20] <duch_kazatel> but the change will happen before the ajax call fires.
[17:26:03] <_TWG_> duch_kazatel: https://jsfiddle.net/maddtechwf/rvyvumt7/
[17:26:29] <duch_kazatel> what's the question?
[17:26:48] <duch_kazatel> you realize you're not doing anything with the inner .map(), right?
[17:27:03] <_TWG_> No i didn't.
[17:27:30] <duch_kazatel> currentObject.data.map(function(item) {}); - you're not doing anything with this
[17:27:35] <duch_kazatel> need to handle the return value somehow.
[17:29:00] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rvyvumt7/1/
[17:29:05] <duch_kazatel> this is one way.
[17:30:06] <_TWG_> This look better https://jsfiddle.net/maddtechwf/rvyvumt7/2/ duch_kazatel
[17:30:29] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[17:30:33] <duch_kazatel> look at my version.
[17:31:05] <_TWG_> oh, just saw you sent a link.
[17:31:07] <_TWG_> looking now
[17:31:43] <_TWG_> will it mess anything up with my date, contract_numb, etc having "" around them?
[17:32:15] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:32:46] <_TWG_> When I parse the CSV it has "" around the headers.
[17:33:00] <duch_kazatel> i'd need to see what you're talking about.
[17:33:06] <duch_kazatel> i doubt it will though.
[17:35:04] <jak2000> duch_kazatel: http://pastie.org/10670115    see line 18 and 19?  these line fire the event change (lines 89-131) and fill the select/option with id: xembnomchof, (9 options) but in line 64 have 0 options, why?
[17:35:38] <duch_kazatel> jak2000 18 and 19 are doing the exact same thing.
[17:35:45] <jak2000> yes
[17:36:03] <duch_kazatel> i have no idea what your data looks like so expecting me to help any further is sort of weird.
[17:36:16] <jak2000> but line 64 have no options
[17:36:17] <jak2000> why?
[17:36:24] <duch_kazatel> i don't know what your markup or data look like.
[17:36:29] <duch_kazatel> how do you expect me to help?
[17:36:30] <jak2000> exist something: .done (loaded the options) and continue
[17:37:23] <_TWG_> thanks for the help duch_kazatel
[17:38:23] <duch_kazatel> jak2000 literally no way for me to help you duder.
[17:38:43] <jak2000> ok
[17:42:13] <temhaa> I have problem with datatable. here is true address?
[17:42:31] <duch_kazatel> temhaa you can ask, but it's kind of a crapshoot whether or not you'll get support.\
[17:42:41] <duch_kazatel> their forums are a good resource though.
[17:43:51] <taplar> heh, datatables are like convention frameworks.  work great until you have an issue and then have to figure out wtf is actually going on, :)
[17:46:25] <taplar> personal opinion
[17:46:35] * taplar has not alienated himself from the convention framework peeps
[17:46:38] <taplar> *now
[17:48:48] <duch_kazatel> sleeeepy./
[17:50:37] <taplar> omg
[17:50:44] <taplar> ok tell me i'm not crazy
[17:50:56] <taplar> i just saw immediately inside an IIFE, var context = $(this);
[17:51:01] <taplar> that's pointless, right?
[17:51:10] <duch_kazatel> show me.
[17:51:16] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34601235/unexpected-jquery-module-behavior
[17:52:25] <duch_kazatel> heh, yep.  totally pointless.  looks like the dude has no idea what he's doing.
[17:52:35] <taplar> ok, just making sure i wasn't nuts
[17:52:50] <temhaa> duch_kazatel: thank. I know. But I couldn't fix my problem. I have table (datatable)
[17:52:54] <duch_kazatel> i can see what they're TRYING to do, but they're confused.
[17:53:28] <temhaa> duch_kazatel: I want to add detail row for my each row: something like that: https://jsfiddle.net/3nfx4Lv6/  But I don't know what is best practice for this.
[17:53:36] <duch_kazatel> temhaa why are you asking me?
[17:53:58] <duch_kazatel> temhaa i don't know anything about datatables.
[17:54:04] <temhaa> duch_kazatel: ok. sorry.
[17:54:15] <duch_kazatel> not an issue, just pointing it out :)
[17:55:12] <temhaa> I have static table (there table in html file as static) How can I do like this:  http://legacy.datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/api/row_details.html
[17:55:35] <duch_kazatel> what have you tried?
[17:56:08] <temhaa> my code something like that:  https://jsfiddle.net/3nfx4Lv6/
[17:56:27] <duch_kazatel> you don't have jquery or datatables in there.
[17:56:28] <duch_kazatel> i'm lost.
[17:58:43] <temhaa> duch_kazatel: it doesnt matter. I am asking what is best practice for this. I am asking for UX :) And I want to learn how can I do. Actually I couldn't do it like datables example (http://legacy.datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/api/row_details.html)
[17:59:09] <duch_kazatel> then you're in the wrong place entirely.
[17:59:18] <duch_kazatel> you want ##design
[18:03:17] <paulong> hi
[18:04:57] <wileysegovia> why is one of my jQuery menus working and not the other? (Drupal 7)
[18:05:17] <wileysegovia> (children not appearing when clicking on parent item)
[18:09:34] <duch_kazatel> wileysegovia without any information, how are you expecting us to help?
[18:09:35] <duch_kazatel> :)
[18:22:50] <wileysegovia> duch_kazatel: it only seems there is no information
[18:23:09] <duch_kazatel> not in front of me.
[18:23:12] <wileysegovia> duch_kazatel: two menus, both selected to be "active" in the jQuery menu config screen
[18:23:19] <wileysegovia> duch_kazatel: one works (expands / collapses)
[18:23:29] <duch_kazatel> "jquery menu config screen" - slow down.
[18:23:32] <wileysegovia> duch_kazatel: the other one doesn't (parent sits there, when clicked, does not expand)
[18:23:38] <wileysegovia> duch_kazatel: in Drupal
[18:23:42] <duch_kazatel> yeah there we go.
[18:23:46] <duch_kazatel> so i'd have to see it.
[18:23:55] <duch_kazatel> because otherwise i have no idea what's going on.
[18:24:02] <duch_kazatel> alternatively, pull out your debugger.
[18:24:16] <wileysegovia> duch_kazatel: admin > config > user-interface > jquerymenu > settings
[18:24:25] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[18:24:28] <duch_kazatel> i don't use drupal.
[18:24:51] <wileysegovia> duch_kazatel: by debugger do you mean right click and select Inspect Element?
[18:25:05] <duch_kazatel> i mean your developer tools, yes.
[18:25:05] <wileysegovia> duch_kazatel: or some other, more sophisticated, advanced debugger?
[18:25:16] <duch_kazatel> there is a step debugger in your developer tools.
[18:25:26] <duch_kazatel> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 is a good slideshow on the subject.
[18:27:12] <wileysegovia> duch_kazatel: ah, very good -- will try that!
[18:27:53] <wileysegovia> duch_kazatel: I learned how to avoid naming conflict between $ and jQuery() last week, so am on my way to becoming a jQuery master soon
[18:27:57] <wileysegovia> duch_kazatel: lol
[18:28:00] <duch_kazatel> hah
[19:26:31] <paulong> i need help
[19:34:35] <taplar> we need a question
[19:34:37] <taplar> :)
[19:36:02] <taplar> unless your saying you actually need help in which case 911 might be more appropriate
[19:36:36] <taplar> or whatever your nationality equavilant is
[19:38:30] <taplar> or i guess i can snark people away...
[19:45:17] <wileysegovia> wow, that escalated quickly
[19:46:12] <wileysegovia> duch_kazatel: it is working now. No idea how. Just kept making changes and suddenly, after making some changes in a completely different part of the site, noticed the menu is working.
[19:46:35] * wileysegovia scratches head.
[19:46:57] <wileysegovia> duch_kazatel: must be a cache thing?
[22:02:53] <yanchai> aloha!
[22:57:45] <SkyFire> hi, i need a Calender datepicker thing, for a form that will get emailed, i assume its Jquery, but i need it to only allow wednsday and Thursday dates. How can i do that?
