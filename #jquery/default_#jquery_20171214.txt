[04:45:28] <nikio_> hello all
[06:00:24] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/gkgkp5qq/15/   line 78 this code checks for empty input fields...is there anyway I could get the values of the name attributes of these inputs...for styling them
[06:37:18] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/z9rkbqk8/11/ how I could get the values of the name attributes of these 2 empty inputs?
[09:17:06] <Dro> Hello, after an ajax query, the functions in $(document).ready are no longer available ?
[09:19:16] <FilipNortic> Dro ready only triggers when the document as finnished loading
[09:19:47] <FilipNortic> after an ajax request you have a separate callback
[09:21:21] <Dro> FilipNortic: $(document).ajaxComplete?
[09:21:54] <FilipNortic> depends on what you want...
[09:22:14] <FilipNortic> but if you want to run a callback after each ajax request then yes
[09:22:53] <FilipNortic> but often better to just but common stuff in a function and run it from .done
[09:24:25] <Dro> FilipNortic: ok thanks
[10:32:59] <Neo3> Hi! I need slider
[10:33:12] <Neo3> which better to use?
[10:59:45] <Neo3> I'll use jQuery UI?
[12:56:16] <DragonPunch> :) hi
[12:56:44] <robertmaxrees> g'mornging
[12:56:49] <robertmaxrees> *morning
[12:57:34] <DragonPunch> <div class="keyclick"><p></p></div> anyone know why when i press the child <p> it wont register the click?
[12:58:01] <robertmaxrees> would need to see the relevant code.
[12:59:02] <DragonPunch> robertmaxress: https://hastebin.com/enurijixaj.cs
[12:59:12] <DragonPunch> well, the <p> does register the click it just says .toString undefined
[12:59:34] <robertmaxrees> where's the element with that ID?
[12:59:41] <robertmaxrees> also: .val() returns a string.
[13:00:16] <DragonPunch> https://hastebin.com/anuqagaler.cs
[13:00:24] <DragonPunch> test.
[13:00:27] <DragonPunch> am i still here?
[13:00:30] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:00:39] <DragonPunch> oh okay said my network disconnected
[13:00:54] <DragonPunch> the input element is the one with the ID
[13:01:43] <robertmaxrees> you want e.currentTarget
[13:02:13] <DragonPunch> can you tell me how mine works differently so i understand >_> been stuck on this last night
[13:02:27] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/event.target/ - "The DOM element that initiated the event. "
[13:02:45] <robertmaxrees> which in your case is often the p tag.  you want https://api.jquery.com/event.currentTarget/
[13:03:39] <DragonPunch> Ah
[13:04:26] <DragonPunch> robertmaxrees: do you have any recommendations for touch screens
[13:04:35] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[13:04:36] <DragonPunch> robertmaxrees: my highlights are messed up
[13:05:04] <DragonPunch> like .on('click') was barely working on an iPad
[13:05:17] <DragonPunch> i had to bind .on('touchstart')
[13:05:41] <robertmaxrees> and touchstart wasn't working?
[13:06:48] <DragonPunch> touchstart is working much much better
[13:07:00] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:07:09] <DragonPunch> but the only problem is :hover, waits for me to tap elsewhere
[13:07:22] <robertmaxrees> there's no such thing as hover on touch interfaces.
[13:07:23] <DragonPunch> before it removes the :hover pseud-class
[13:07:36] <robertmaxrees> so you'll have to design the entire interface to behave as such.
[13:08:00] <booter> Hi all
[13:08:02] <DragonPunch> how would i go on about creating a "tap" kind of like feature
[13:08:09] <booter> how do I check if I am in iframe in javascript?
[13:08:18] <robertmaxrees> DragonPunch not sure i follow
[13:08:32] <robertmaxrees> booter back up - why would you want to know that?
[13:09:03] <booter> robertmaxrees: I want to block functionality if I am in iframe
[13:09:22] <robertmaxrees> booter like, everything?  or just specific things?
[13:09:31] <booter> specifics
[13:11:22] <robertmaxrees> booter i'd almost argue that you want to detect that server-side and just serve up a different page.
[13:11:29] <robertmaxrees> or make people use a different url entirelyt.
[13:12:32] <robertmaxrees> you can also do something like https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18231189/jquery-check-if-content-is-sitting-inside-an-iframe, or https://www.sitepoint.com/jquery-check-window-iframe/
[13:12:38] <robertmaxrees> lots of google results for that.
[13:13:28] <DragonPunch> robertmaxrees: so basically, touchstart ... the :hover element is applied .. but if i lift my finger off the screen .. the :hover element is still there on my div until i touch somewhere else
[13:13:53] <robertmaxrees> DragonPunch right.  because there's no concept of "hover" on mobile devices :)
[13:14:00] <booter> aha
[13:14:01] <robertmaxrees> the css might do some funky stuff.
[13:14:10] <DragonPunch> it is doing some funky stuff haha
[13:14:23] <DragonPunch> so how do i make it so that it only changes the background color for when i tap the div
[13:14:38] <robertmaxrees> DragonPunch i highly recommend heading to #css for this, since your question is about CSS.
[13:14:57] <DragonPunch> robertmaxrees okay
[13:18:45] <DragonPunch> robertmaxrees: div:active seems to do the trick found out in #css thanks :)
[13:18:52] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:54:29] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/z9rkbqk8/11/ how I could get the values of the name attributes of these 2 empty inputs?
[14:55:05] <robertmaxrees> .prop('name')
[14:55:10] <robertmaxrees> just select them and du that ^
[14:55:10] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/z9rkbqk8/
[14:55:13] <robertmaxrees> *do
[14:55:38] <dimi1947> I suppose that for selector I could use their classes correct?
[14:55:49] <robertmaxrees> that's one option.
[14:57:26] <dimi1947> by using classes thoughI am getting also the property name of the input box that already filled...not what I want
[14:57:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:57:58] <robertmaxrees> do you mean to say you only want the name attribute for empty inputs?
[14:58:11] <dimi1947> yes
[14:58:32] <robertmaxrees> can use .filter() for that.
[15:00:49] <dimi1947> with a function?
[15:00:53] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[15:03:08] <dimi1947> I am having some difficulty doing it my own....any help would be appreciated
[15:03:16] <robertmaxrees> show me what you've tried.
[15:05:31] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/z9rkbqk8/13/
[15:06:40] <robertmaxrees> erm
[15:06:48] <robertmaxrees> .val('') is setting the value to empty.
[15:06:55] <robertmaxrees> you want to get the current value, right?
[15:07:13] <robertmaxrees> you're also not doing anything after the filter.
[15:08:06] <dimi1947> I am not surprized to hear all these...
[15:08:12] <robertmaxrees> erm...
[15:08:18] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what .val('') does?
[15:09:25] <dimi1947> yes...
[15:09:33] <robertmaxrees> so then why are you using it in that fiddle?
[15:20:51] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[21:51:19] <dimi1947> how else I am going to check if the inputs are empty or not?
[23:29:20] <nikio_> hey Robdgreat
[23:41:50] <Robdgreat> hey nikio_
[23:42:10] <nikio_> how r yall
[23:42:30] <nikio_> is jquery dying, or is it just a small dent
[23:43:32] <Robdgreat> I wasn't aware of a decline
[23:44:45] <nikio_> Robdgreat, it exists... frameworks like angular or react are slowly taking a piece of the pie
[23:44:57] <nikio_> jquery is like a wildwest in client side web develpoment
