[00:21:23] <vladster> Hey guys
[00:22:10] <vladster> If I want to set a click event to the entirety of the document, is $('html').click() the way to go? It actually seems to work for what I'm trying to do, except that the event triggers on document load, without any clicks (to the best of my knowledge) present
[00:32:44] <Mag-neto> hello friends
[00:33:14] <Mag-neto> i want as i scroll down the the opacity of a page goes to 1
[00:33:20] <Mag-neto> but code is not working
[00:33:33] <Mag-neto> http://jsfiddle.net/meEf4/1325/
[00:33:42] <Mag-neto> take a look
[00:34:02] <Mag-neto> for a particular div as i start scroll on that and end the scrolling it's opacity goes to 1. i can do that
[00:34:03] <Mag-neto>  but for many divs its not working
[00:34:09] <Mag-neto> any help or suggestion
[00:34:12] <Mag-neto> ?
[01:02:07] <kpl> in $(this).nextUntil(':not(.someclass)') will <script> be included and thus stop the next iteration?
[01:02:42] <Code2Consumer> Hello guys! I wanned to know if thats possible to NOT detect click on a parents but only on the childs ?
[01:04:49] <Cork> Code2Consumer: sure
[01:05:21] <Cork> $('parent').on('click', function(event) { if(event.target == this) { return; } /* not parent but children */  });
[01:05:41] <Cork> kpl: yes
[01:05:54] <Code2Consumer> I already tryed somethink like this but i go try it thanks
[01:07:04] <kpl> Cork: Thanks. It'll explain my current problem.
[01:10:12] <Code2Consumer> OMGGGG
[01:10:22] <Code2Consumer> IT WORK THANKS YOU A LOT !!!
[01:11:39] <Code2Consumer> damn men i was trying to make this work for 2 hours and you find the solution in 30 sec, I love you and im jalouse at the same time xD Ok enough flood thank you again ! :)
[01:11:54] <Cork> heh yw
[01:28:32] <kpl> In $(this).nextUntil(':not(.someclass)').last()  I'd like to ignore <script> elements, or only include <div>s for the nextUntil (which gets all following siblings up to but not including the element matched by the selector). Thus, the "last" will not be a <script>, but a <div>. How could I do it?
[01:45:41] <kpl> I guess want I want is something like the "pseudo": $(this).nextUntil('div:not(.someclass)').last_of_tagname_div()
[01:51:35] <kpl> which would be: $(this).nextUntil('div:not(.someclass)').filter('div').last()
[02:09:52] <Code2Consumer> Can we restart an event, cancel it or redefine it ?
[02:10:04] <Code2Consumer> ok delet it ?
[02:11:27] <xinming_> Is it ok to ask jgallery question in this channel?
[02:37:38] <afmza> As soon as i anable jquery tooltips, my page title is no longer visiable? (and tooltips dont work)
[02:37:43] <afmza> enable*
[02:45:26] <FrEaKmAn_> if I do, element.on('submit', 'form', ...), what is the way to remove events? element.off('**) or element.find('form').off('**')?
[02:46:56] <FrEaKmAn_> what is the proper way*
[02:47:12] <Cork> FrEaKmAn_: element.off('submit', 'form')
[02:47:27] <FrEaKmAn_> Cork: ow.. it makes sense
[03:04:38] <gtristan> so when I want to set an attr without any value, as I understand I use $(domNode).attr ('attribute-name', '');
[03:04:41] <gtristan> with an empty string
[03:04:57] <gtristan> but I'm curious... if I am looping over node.attributes...
[03:04:59] <Cork> gtristan: dom don't support name only
[03:05:05] <Cork> so yes
[03:05:18] <Cork> <elm attr> becomes elm.attr == "" in dom
[03:05:22] <gtristan> and I ask for $(node).attr (attributes[i].name)... will I consistently get an empty string ?
[03:05:32] <Cork> gtristan: yes
[03:05:37] <gtristan> Ok
[03:05:44] <gtristan> Cork, thanks :)
[03:05:47] <Cork> np
[03:06:35] <Cork> gtristan: note that if you are creating a custom attribute name ALWAYS prefix it with data-
[03:06:58] <gtristan> Cork, yes, well - I use my own namespace but yes
[03:07:08] <Cork> gtristan: you shouldn't do that
[03:07:13] <Cork> only data- is reserved
[03:07:13] <gtristan> any reason ?
[03:07:21] <Cork> it is reserved in the html specs
[03:07:37] <Cork> so the standard won't ever define a colliding attribute that starts with data-
[03:07:39] <gtristan> so the HTML might... remove things ?
[03:08:01] <Cork> you might hit a new name if you don't use data-
[03:08:08] <Cork> so you should never ever do it
[03:08:14] <Cork> anyway gtg
[03:08:21] <gtristan> Ok, I get the reasoning
[03:08:54] <gtristan> I highly doubt it will ever define "pony-${something}" either, but I get the point
[03:09:24] <gtristan> the same could be said for anyone using posix, but posix is not a moving target
[03:11:35] <Code2Consumer> Can we restart an event, cancel it or redefine it  ?
[03:11:46] <Code2Consumer> i mean functions
[03:24:12] <breking> I have  a line in my jQuery code that looks like this: $("#message").text("One<br />Two"); But, when the page loads, instead of a line break between One and Two, I see the text "One<br />Two" printed in the page.
[03:24:40] <breking> The CSS doesn't have anything interesting that may change its behavior.
[03:24:52] <breking> Any ideas what as to what may be causing this?
[03:26:33] <Tomashe> guys i got a prob with jquer mobile, i load pages using ajax and handlebars and then run tigger('create') but it makes a mess in the page, from duplicate pages footers to problems with interface . anyone can help me out ? there is a way to initialize jquery on specific page every time i do load new data programticly?
[03:27:43] <breking> I also tried "$("#message").text("One\nTwo");" to see if this is due to a pre tag somewhere. But then I get the text "One Two" printed in the page
[03:32:27] <BinaryKitten> breking remember text = text
[03:32:40] <BinaryKitten> so One<br />Two gets treated as text
[03:32:49] <breking> How can I change that behavior?
[03:32:54] <BinaryKitten> if you want to have the linebreak, you need to use .html
[03:33:41] <breking> $("#message").text("One<br />Two").html(); gives the same result. Is that what you meant?
[03:34:31] <BinaryKitten> no
[03:34:48] <BinaryKitten> $('#message').html('One<br />Two');
[03:35:07] <BinaryKitten> will put the html tag <br /> as actual HTML
[03:35:09] <breking> Yesssss! Thanks a lot BinaryKitten
[03:39:07] <abailarri> Hello. I'm using this: var file = $("#responseFile")[0].files[0]; to get a file information. With FF and Chrome works fine, but in IE I can't retrieve the type attribute. Any suggestion please?
[03:39:54] <b100s> hi2all
[03:40:10] <b100s> is it possible to disable encoding html tags for method html() ?
[03:40:27] <b100s> or are there another way to get raw content of tag?
[03:45:47] <b100s> got it! using text() instead html()
[03:50:44] <Code2Consumer> How can i select child from a div but not child of those childs ?
[03:51:10] <Code2Consumer> just the first lvl of childs
[03:51:55] <xec> Code2Consumer: just use .children()
[04:07:09] <gtristan> Can I rely on the order of $(node).children() being the same order as specified in the DOM ?
[04:07:12] <gtristan> I would guess so ?

[05:05:02] <printForever> guys
[05:05:05] <printForever> I haz a problem
[05:05:13] <printForever> dont worry, its not girls
[05:06:18] <printForever> the problem revolves around the topic - how to execute jQuery code after the page has been updated
[05:07:01] <printForever> I have a DIV that is loaded dynamically by backend PHP, after the page is created
[05:07:45] <printForever> so, is there a way I can "reload" my jQuery script to go through the DOM and locate the new DIV and apply changes to it
[05:09:04] <gtristan> printForever, PHP can be confusing, the PHP runs and completes and then, after it finishes, the output is handed over the wire to the browser - in the browser the result is already there and no PHP exists anymore
[05:09:43] <printForever> its added by asynchronous php
[05:09:47] <gtristan> printForever, unless you are doing some AJAX request to another PHP script which gives you some other HTML content from which you build a <div> and add it dynamically in the client, the page doesnt change
[05:10:00] <printForever> right, I am
[05:10:10] <gtristan> and if you do that request, then you already have the reply
[05:10:11] <printForever> its an AJAX request
[05:10:24] <printForever> I do? Where?
[05:10:26] <gtristan> so when you get the reply, you just execute whatever you need to execute
[05:10:46] <gtristan> well, if you are calling $.ajax(), you get a default callback to that
[05:11:05] <gtristan> and you can connect anything to the returned jqXHR object (or whatever it's called)
[05:11:31] <gtristan> i.e. for failure cases etc, but the arguments take the callback which is called upon successful retrieval of data
[05:14:21] <printForever> I dont know how to do that... :D
[05:14:26] <printForever> example?
[05:16:00] <jnhghy> I'm trying to open a dialog from inside an input (when the input gets focus or the user clicks inside it, the code works for "click" but when I try to use "focus" it shows the dialog only once any clue why? here is my cod:
[05:16:25] <logikos> printForever: it seems to me that php really has nothing at all to do with this question, it doesnt mater what php does in the backend, you are just wanting to work with the markup you get back from the server in the ajax callback function
[05:16:56] <printForever> example? :/
[05:17:06] <jnhghy> http://pastebin.com/9qBGxJY3
[05:17:16] <printForever> ynx
[05:18:03] <jnhghy> thing is that if I comment the on focus part(first 3 lines) everything works great, if I put it there, the click function also works only once ... I wonder why?
[05:18:09] <printForever> lol, not an example
[05:18:31] <jnhghy> printForever: a jsfiddle? :D
[05:19:18] <logikos> printForever: he pasted something related to his question not yours
[05:19:29] <printForever> right
[05:19:46] <logikos> printForever: try to explain what you are want to do with the markup you get back from the server
[05:23:50] <logikos> $.ajax("somepage.php").done(function(data){ /* the var data here is most likly a string containing html markup you can append it to an existing dom element or you can do something else with it, i dont know what you want to do so i cant give you an example beyond this */  });
[05:24:33] <printForever> eating :))) one sec
[05:25:03] <logikos> i have to get back to work and dont have much time, so most likly someone else will help you when you return, good luck
[05:25:17] <printForever> tnx
[05:25:28] <printForever> you were helpful I will try what you said
[05:25:36] <printForever> I was interested in the principle
[05:25:38] <printForever> itself
[05:27:04] <logikos> printForever: if you have not already, i would encourage you to read http://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/ http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/ and http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[05:27:16] <printForever> thanks!
[05:39:32] <shwaiil> Q: How to pass data to a promise done method ? let's assume promise.done(fooFn.bind(this, response)), this doesn't work, response is not passed to fooFn. Any tips ?

[05:47:14] <Silmarilion> anyone used some css grid system with jquery mobile?
[05:56:29] <sniperh4x0r> hey guys
[05:56:52] <sniperh4x0r> i apologize if this question doesn't make sense for this irc
[05:57:15] <sniperh4x0r> but i'm trying to figure out how much money i should ask for as i transition to full time with my current job
[05:57:20] <sniperh4x0r> they are moving me from contract to full time
[05:57:27] <sniperh4x0r> im from the boston area
[05:57:36] <sniperh4x0r> i mostly do jquery css html
[05:57:44] <sniperh4x0r> occasional php
[05:57:50] <sniperh4x0r> nothing backend related though
[05:58:20] <sniperh4x0r> i checked on indeed for the average salary of a jquery developer in boston ma
[05:58:27] <sniperh4x0r> it said around 65k
[05:58:44] <sniperh4x0r> I'm thinking of asking for 65k-70k
[05:58:48] <sniperh4x0r> what do you guys think?
[06:00:29] <jnhghy> sniperh4x0r: I don't think you can find a decent coder(freelancer) under $30/h your 65k is about $33/h so you are not expensive at all
[06:01:25] <sniperh4x0r> hmmm
[06:01:32] <sniperh4x0r> so maybe i should ask for 75k
[06:01:36] <sniperh4x0r> or 80k
[06:01:55] <sniperh4x0r> tbh i dont even know
[06:11:48] <Tomashe> any jquery mobile pro?
[06:13:04] <jnhghy> Q: why would .focus run only once but .click work without issues?
[06:18:25] <Cork> jnhghy: focus fires when focus moves
[06:18:30] <Cork> it stays on the element
[06:18:34] <Cork> click happens on every click
[06:19:59] <jnhghy> Cork: well that's the thing, I move focus to input and it fires a dialog, I close the dialog (the dialog changes focus to oher input element) and change the focus back to initial input but this time the dialog doesn't open anymore :(
[06:21:09] <Cork> jnhghy: fiddle it
[06:22:45] <no_gravity> Hello! How do you trigger the click event on a dom element?
[06:24:29] <Cork> no_gravity: .click() or .trigger('click')
[06:25:49] <no_gravity> Cork: i see. let me play around with that...
[06:32:42] <mikehaas763> I am writing my pure js/jquery in "modules". I then call in to a module's initialize function from the pages where it's necessary. like mycompany.login.initialize(); That module may need to reference 10 different dom elements on the page
[06:33:12] <mikehaas763> are there any common patterns for passing the elements that the module needs so that the module is not tightly coupled the specific dom selector id's
[06:35:53] <mikehaas763> For a simple boilerplate example of what I'm doing http://jsfiddle.net/yssqyytz/
[06:36:29] <no_gravity> Cork: seems to work: http://things.gnod.com/laptops/ just added an auto-click on pageload to the menu on the left
[06:36:36] <mikehaas763> Except for in that module I may actually need to use ~10 different elements like $('#some-id')
[06:45:54] <jnhghy> I have a simple script that opens a dialog on click and it works if I try to run the same code on focus it fires only once :(,  script deson't work on my website but it works in jsfiddle there is no js run between triggers, my layout also includes bootstrap how can I debug this?
[06:49:18] <jnhghy> I've added some console.log variables and it seems that the dialog("open") gets triggered but nothing happens after that, why would adding a focus break the dialog opening?
[06:51:58] <jnhghy> i've added a log to dialog open: and it seems it gets fired twice once for the focus and once when the dialog closes even if I have a cloase: function that switches focus, how can I fix this?
[07:02:16] <shoky> jnhghy: show the fiddle, even tho it works..
[07:03:34] <shoky> and try to add stuff from your site to the fiddle until it shows the same problem, i guess ;S  or link to your site
[07:05:52] <Sherafff> hi, i have a function lazy load : http://pastebin.com/ADR7RviX
[07:06:07] <Sherafff> it's binded on "resize" and "scroll" event
[07:06:31] <Sherafff> but i think it take too much ressources, every time i scroll, i can feel it slow down
[07:06:39] <Sherafff> what would be a better alternative?
[07:08:25] <jnhghy> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/15wff63j/
[07:10:56] <Sherafff> it's so dead here :(
[07:12:16] <Cork> Sherafff: the heavy part is most likely the :in-viewport as you can't get that info without traversing every element
[07:13:04] <Sherafff> :/
[07:13:30] <Sherafff> Cork: i think i should fire only when i stop scrolling
[07:13:35] <decx> precache image elements outside the scroll
[07:13:36] <Sherafff> but i can't find any event
[07:14:03] <Cork> Sherafff: you would have to use a timer
[07:14:19] <Cork> and clear the timer in the beginning of the event and then queue a new timer
[07:14:20] <Sherafff> decx: i'm doing that mainly to save bandwidth
[07:14:54] <decx> that just means you dotn have expensive dom lookups every 10ms on scroll
[07:15:02] <Kage> What are the advantages of:  var data = $(xmlString);  vs:  var data = $.parseXML(xmlString);
[07:15:05] <Kage> ?
[07:15:55] <Cork> Kage: the first one will parse it as html (not much difference)
[07:16:11] <Cork> and the first one will wrap the fragment in a jquery object
[07:16:18] <Cork> while the second gives it to you raw
[07:16:48] <Kage> That's what she said (sorry I couldn't help)
[07:16:52] <Cork> Kage: so $($.parseXML(xmlString)) should give you about the same
[07:17:23] <Kage> Cork: ok, thanks for your help :)
[07:26:36] <Anass> hey geys
[07:36:21] <mikehaas763> Is it actually pretty common to prefix jquery object elements with $? I've been seeing it in a few different places lately
[07:36:25] <jsys> Hmm has anyone experienced this: during .fadeIn() an element with a lower z-index is above the faded element, and at the end it's fixed.
[07:37:23] <jsys> Update, seems like any opacity other than 1 renders bad z-index
[07:39:09] <Cork> mikehaas763: some do some don't
[07:39:28] <Cork> mikehaas763: it's quite individual
[07:39:34] <mikehaas763> Cork, but not an overwhelming majority in either direction?
[07:39:48] <Cork> mikehaas763: no
[07:39:51] <mooncup> I do it sometimes
[07:39:54] <mooncup> it depends on my mood
[07:40:06] <Cork> i did for a while, but it just becomes messy after a while
[07:40:12] <mooncup> I like to avoid it though, otherwise I find myself coding in php
[07:40:18] <Cork> and i find it quite pointless now days
[07:40:58] <Cork> ya, some that do it does it out of habit (php)
[07:42:27] <mikehaas763> I just got to thinking about it because I had a raw form element and was trying to attach a submit handler like rawElement.submit(myHandlerFunc). My page was then in a really fast infinite submit loop. Didn't realize until I figured out that rawFormElement wasn't wrapped as a jquery element
[07:43:41] <Cork> mikehaas763: i normally solve that by having explanatory names of the variables instead
[07:44:44] <mooncup> var thisIsNotAJquerySelector = '';
[07:44:44] <mooncup> ?
[07:44:47] <mikehaas763> Cork, what do you mean? I had loginFormElement not sure how I can get more description
[07:45:11] <Cork> mikehaas763: true
[07:45:27] <Cork> though i normally don't pass none wrapped elements around between code sections
[07:45:33] <Cork> (except for canvas references)
[08:19:09] <bbclover> hey guys can you get some information off another page using jquery or javascript?
[08:20:21] <NoiseEee> bbclover: not really, esp. if that page isn't on your domain
[08:20:50] <bbclover> but how do people get information off websites then?
[08:20:56] <bbclover> like so: http://jsfiddle.net/NTUx5/
[08:21:19] <bbclover> I just want to read the contents of html on this website which I can do manually... but automate it, you know?
[08:21:30] <bbclover> you can go to view page source and see all of the ids and stuff
[08:21:37] <bbclover> can I somehow download the page first and then grab thnigs?
[08:22:48] <Uhkis> https://api.stackexchange.com/docs
[08:22:49] <logikos> bbclover: if the site publishes an rss feed you can get that data, or if they have an api you can use serverside tech (such as php) to get the data before sending to the browser
[08:23:02] <logikos> or again with php, you can use curl() to read it
[08:23:52] <NoiseEee> bbclover: rule of thumb is basically 'use their API'; if they don't have one, you can use a backend language to do your business (which 99% of the time is against their terms of use)
[08:24:05] <logikos> but for the most part if you want data from another domain you shouldnt use javascript becuase it forces the end user to make a connection to them .. the potential for that to be used maliciously is high so in general it is not allowed
[08:24:41] <bbclover> I love going against terms of use
[08:24:47] <bbclover> I guess I gotta learn some backend language
[08:25:04] <bbclover> I just wanna make some bucks
[08:25:14] <bbclover> by formatting a table based on data on this website
[08:25:30] <NoiseEee> well you've got steps 1 and 3 out of the way congrats
[08:26:03] <logikos> if you want to make money your time would be better spent doing something other than violating terms of use of other websites
[08:26:27] <bbclover> but I won't be able to get the information without getting it off these sites
[08:26:43] <bbclover> and I could just like write it down and make a static website but yeah... I want it to be up to date
[08:27:03] <logikos> use an iframe
[08:27:28] <logikos> or use the provided api for each site
[08:27:44] <bbclover> this site has no api
[08:27:47] <logikos> if they do not provide an api or an rss feed it is not intended to be republished on other sites
[08:28:12] <logikos> so your trying to take crap other ppl publish and put it on your site in hopes of making money
[08:28:25] <bbclover> yes
[08:28:33] <logikos> good luck with that
[08:28:45] <logikos> lazy bum lol
[08:28:49] <bbclover> well logikos I will share the earnings haha
[08:28:57] <logikos> you cant afford me
[08:29:03] <logikos> lol
[08:29:05] <bbclover> do you know the game league of legends? It's related to that
[08:29:37] <logikos> no i dont, i get paid to code, not play games
[08:30:06] <bbclover> was just wondering
[08:30:18] <logikos> even if you did create a backend way to get the data useing php curl etc .. the second they alter there modify there markup your code breaks
[08:31:00] <bbclover> I literally only have to grab a couple of numbers per page
[08:31:31] <logikos> but to find those numbers you have to get the page markup, navigate the DOM and get the numbers
[08:31:48] <logikos> if they change the markup, your method of finding the numbers by navigating the DOM will also have to change
[08:32:05] <logikos> so the odds of your code breaking over time and needing updated is high
[08:33:43] <NoiseEee> bbclover: its a good exercise to learn a bit more, but what logikos says is true, not to mention the possibility of them blocking your server IP for too many requests
[08:34:29] <newview> I'm trying to find the content of a div by id within an iframe using: $('#sig_content').contents().find('#jq_title2').text() - it's returning an empty string.. and ideas?
[08:34:46] <newview> $('#sig_content').contents() returns the object.
[08:36:23] <bbclover> I actually found this api
[08:36:27] <bbclover> I'll look into it
[08:36:29] <bbclover> thanks ya'll
[08:37:13] <newview> $('#sig_content').contents().find('body').html() isn't working either.. hrm
[08:39:28] <decx> the iframe source has to be on the same domain as the one where it's embedded or you cant access it
[08:43:28] <newview> decx: it's in localhost
[08:44:04] <decx> well then it's probably a typo or some other mistake
[08:53:47] <logikos> if its in localhost why on earth are you useing an iframe.. that is foolish
[08:55:32] <decx> it's only foolish to render judgement on imperfect information
[08:56:50] <supsup> all information is imperfect though how can i judge anything now!
[08:57:03] <decx> now you're getting it
[08:57:04] <decx> ^^
[08:57:15] <mooncup> 17:56 < supsup> all information is imperfect
[08:57:17] <Ohga> hello. I'm trying to write a refined ui.resizable that provides a reset method change the size back to the state when the resizable were created. I started with http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7506104/jquery-ui-resizable-set-size-programmatically#answer-18632191 (which seem to reset when an option is set) and came up with http://pastebin.com/kuHByYWB . This one doesn't work with a "alsoResize" though.
[08:57:28] <mooncup> surely you can't know that unless you yourself have perfect information
[08:57:34] <mooncup> which makes that a bit of a paradox
[08:57:38] <Ohga> how can I make this work, and is there more details I should consider to make it robust?
[08:58:04] <supsup> the lack of knowing makes it known.
[09:01:20] <paulvd> hello, am trying to build a 3 level menu, however when i click on first, i guess the other dropdown is also reacting?
[09:01:21] <paulvd> http://jsfiddle.net/fenbjpxd/
[09:03:01] <robertmaxrees> event bubbling.
[09:03:15] <robertmaxrees> consider using e.stopImmediatePropagation(); instead of e.preventDefault()
[09:05:10] <paulvd> ah thanks
[09:07:53] <newview> decx - still can't figure this out.. could you check http://pastebin.com/w5Dm3c6F ?
[09:12:20] <decx> no idea
[09:12:50] <newview> eh.. got it
[09:13:24] <newview> had to wait until the iframe loads.. $('#sig_content').load(function(){
[09:14:00] <decx> ah true, doc ready is before that, good
[09:16:46] <Ohga> couldn't make a jsfiddle for my problem because, as far as I know, I can't have it load the jq ui css and images
[09:17:10] <supsup> you can, add link via external resources
[09:17:23] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6bska7n0/
[09:17:35] <robertmaxrees> it's an option under "external resources".
[09:17:44] <Ohga> I added the jquery-ui.js one, but what about the images for the css?
[09:17:47] <robertmaxrees> pick a jq version that has jqui available and call it a day.
[09:17:54] <Ohga> is it in the correct relative place on the cdn?
[09:18:25] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/MbOrUza.png
[09:18:25] <Ohga> oh... jq 2.1.0 didn't have the UI
[09:19:54] <Ohga> ok, tried that but I'm not getting the handle icon for the ui.resizable
[09:21:04] <mikehaas763> holy shit.. my company wants to start using ignite ui jquery controls (infragistics) but the base js files minified are 2800 KB. That's not including css or images or the dependencies on jquery and jquery-ui (to be fair those are already included).
[09:22:18] <supsup> maybe their use case is OK with the size
[09:24:01] <robertmaxrees> compress a few PNGs on your site and it's all good.
[09:25:31] <spudzee111> this: http://jsfiddle.net/1sqze2mz/ is supposed to make it where when you scroll over the next div with class='scrollsnap' it will move you all the way down to it. I can't seem to get it to work
[09:26:06] <mikehaas763> supsup, they don't think about use cases
[09:26:23] <Ohga> I am not missing the handle in my actual app, but this is what happens in the http://jsfiddle.net/k6y8j53o/
[09:26:26] <spudzee111> in this case, when your scrolling, you will hit the next div which is blue, and it is supposed to scroll you all the way down there
[09:26:32] <supsup> mike maybe they agile'd it out and had some meetings, and decided to waterfall approach this one
[09:26:41] <Ohga> (yes, I want resize: none;)
[09:26:57] <mikehaas763> supsup, the fuck does that mean lol
[09:27:12] <supsup> it's a joke, but i guess it's too silly
[09:27:33] <supsup> that's what my PMs like to do anyway use terms they don't understand ~
[09:28:56] <mikehaas763> supsup, I see... you had me fooled
[09:31:37] <supsup> spudzee111:   It’s a very, very, bad idea to attach handlers to the window scroll event. Depending upon the browser the scroll event can fire a lot and putting code in the scroll callback will slow down any attempts to scroll the page (not a good idea). Any performance degradation in the scroll handler(s) as a result will only compound the performance of scrolling overall. Instead it’s much better to use some form of a timer to check every X milliseconds 
[09:31:45] <abailarri> Anyone know for what reasons can appear this error? TypeError: e is undefined
[09:32:02] <robertmaxrees> superspring it depends largely on what the handler's doing btw.
[09:32:12] <robertmaxrees> abailarri you're trying to call a variable that doesn't exist.
[09:32:58] <abailarri> robertmaxrees, and how can I know what var is?
[09:33:10] <supsup> it's e
[09:33:22] <supsup> prob e for event
[09:33:27] <supsup> in some anon function call
[09:33:31] <supsup> use debugger should go right to it
[09:33:43] <robertmaxrees> abailarri there should be a line number and filename referenced in the error.
[09:34:19] <abailarri> yes robertmaxrees  jquery.min.js (line 4, col 5188)
[09:34:38] <supsup> walk stack backwards to find out what called it before jquery in debugger
[09:34:53] <robertmaxrees> abailarri then it's another line of code - you're probably calling a jquery or plugin method incorrectly.
[09:35:13] <supsup> you should make jsfiddle example
[09:35:36] <abailarri> robertmaxrees, no, the error appears only in one case on my code
[09:35:37] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/pipokabomo/1/edit?js,output
[09:35:37] <BillCriswell> oops
[09:36:15] <robertmaxrees> abailarri huh?  do you know where in your code it is?
[09:36:23] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle or fixee or something wouild help us a lot here.
[09:37:51] <aftab> Hello, How do I make jquery recognize taps on two different buttons at the same time please ?
[09:37:57] <robertmaxrees> wut
[09:37:58] <aftab> on a mobile app
[09:41:56] <supsup> spidzee111 :  i think you just had an error in your console.log using a var that does not exist:  http://jsfiddle.net/1sqze2mz/2/  -- does this work like you want?  Granted as John Resig said your not suppose to put handler on window scroll event.
[09:42:02] <aftab> Hello, on a mobile html5 app how do I make jquery recognize taps on two different buttons at the same time please? I am using hammer.js with it and on("tap") it works for one button but when I tap on both buttons it doesn't work also when I touch and hold one button and click on another it doesn't work
[09:42:52] <aftab> please let me know what to use for touch events to call functions on each button tap even if another is already being tapped
[09:43:19] <aftab> sorry the 2nd msg was meant for another channel
[09:45:05] <supsup> spidzee111 :  that is super annoying in fact you basically steal the default behavior of scroll, I’d be pretty mad using that.
[09:45:45] <cannap> Hi i have this http://laravel.io/bin/NkmwB but i dont know how i call the current class in the loop?
[09:45:51] <cannap> this gives me the complete div
[09:46:01] <cannap> i need this.class for the current element
[09:46:04] <cannap> but dontt know how
[09:46:09] <robertmaxrees>  jQuery(jQuery('.neun-popup')).each(function (index) { wat
[09:46:19] <cannap> ah i removed this
[09:46:23] <cannap> only a test
[09:46:54] <robertmaxrees> jQuery('.neun-popup').each(function() { jQuery(this).addClass('whateverYoutWant') });
[09:47:38] <cannap> i dont want add a Class i need the current .neun-popup class
[09:47:41] <cannap> to call a plugin
[09:47:57] <robertmaxrees> then define "call the current class in the loop"
[09:48:08] <robertmaxrees> because `this` is the current element.
[09:48:23] <cannap> yes the but this has more than only the class in
[09:48:29] <cannap> i need todo this with regex?
[09:48:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:48:35] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what you mean
[09:48:56] <cannap> http://cl.ly/image/1P1Q3L2n060J
[09:49:23] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't tell me anything.
[09:49:37] <supsup> make jsfiddle
[09:49:55] <robertmaxrees> does custombox expect a selector for the target option?
[09:50:00] <cannap> this is the plugin http://dixso.github.io/custombox/  i need to set the current target from the loop
[09:50:12] <cannap> but i dont know how i figure this out
[09:50:18] <robertmaxrees> does custombox expect a selector for the target option?
[09:50:42] <cannap> wait i have a beter idea to do this
[09:50:51] <cannap> i add an unique id to every popup from php
[09:50:59] <logikos> cannap: why are you double wraping '.neun-popup' in jquery .. your doing jQuery(jQuery('.neun-popup'))
[09:50:59] <cannap> and call simple the id
[09:51:07] <cannap> i removed this ..
[09:51:15] <robertmaxrees> logikos i already asked that ;)
[09:51:21] <logikos> oh
[09:51:22] <cannap> was only i a test and i forgot to remove in the paste
[09:51:24] <logikos> lol
[09:51:41] <aftab> Hello, do you guys know any jquery mobile plugin for multi touch events which can work on simultaneous taps on different html elements pleasE ?
[09:52:15] <robertmaxrees> cannap looks like tht plugin doesn't support supplying an object to target, but your question is really bizarre.
[09:52:25] <robertmaxrees> why can't you just pass that selector to the open method?
[09:53:53] <cannap> so works with this.id
[09:54:18] <robertmaxrees> cannap why are you enumerating over everything in the first place?
[09:54:42] <cannap> i dont know how many popups a user created
[09:54:48] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:54:57] <cannap> i dont know its works now for me
[09:55:02] <cannap> thx
[09:55:11] <robertmaxrees> why can't you just pass the class selector in to the target option?
[09:55:19] <cannap> its not unique i forgot
[09:55:29] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't matter.
[09:55:35] <cannap> i dont know
[09:55:37] <cannap> class not working
[09:56:10] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/lfm9a4q/
[09:56:14] <robertmaxrees> this doesn't work?
[09:56:25] <cannap> yes but there has more than one
[09:56:44] <robertmaxrees> so the class selector would only open the first one?  that's a funky plugin.
[10:02:28] <cannap> it works now for me thx for help
[10:03:13] <spudzee111> sorry about that, I had to go afk. supsup, now that we have that working, let me explain my problem
[10:03:21] <spudzee111> oh, he left
[10:04:45] <spudzee111> my problem with this: http://jsfiddle.net/1sqze2mz/2/ is that it doesn't take into account how large the div is. I want it to, when you scroll down, hit the bottom of the red div. And then if you scroll down again, it will go to the next SPACE2
[10:08:06] <spudzee111> if someone could fix it where it would take into account how large the div is, that would be much appreciated
[10:08:12] <robertmaxrees> err.
[10:08:20] <robertmaxrees> why not do it yourself?
[10:08:23] <robertmaxrees> not meaning to be a jerk.
[10:08:50] <spudzee111> because I really can't work out how
[10:09:04] <robertmaxrees> then why not ask for help on how to do it?
[10:09:07] <spudzee111> I've tried for like hours, but I can't work out how to do it
[10:09:20] <spudzee111> atleast give me a hint
[10:09:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:09:49] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what the fix is.  any idea where the problem might be?
[10:11:00] <spudzee111> if the div is say, 1000 px in height, and you scroll down, I want it to hit the bottom of the div instead of moving to the next one. I imagine calculating a distance between the current page and the bottom of the div you're on would help
[10:11:13] <spudzee111> current window*
[10:12:26] <robertmaxrees> that snaps array and the newtop vs oldtop stuff is probably where is issue lies.
[10:12:43] <spudzee111> say... $(window).height() + $(window).scrollTop() - $(currentdiv).height() - $(currentdiv).scrollTop()
[10:13:21] <spudzee111> I guess the problem I'm having is that I can't work out how to change the code to fix the issue
[10:13:46] <spudzee111> I'm just trying to adapt to it

[11:01:24] <robertmaxrees> according to the download box on the homepage, version 1.4.5 is compatible with 1.8 - 1.11/2.1
[11:04:01] <aracodex123> hi everyone, I've been scouring over the net for the past couple of hours and researching on how to do multiple drag drops
[11:04:27] <daylum> wow, it's there and i didnt see it. thx rob
[11:05:11] <aracodex123> and I can't find a suitable solution. Here's what I'm looking for - Since I'm able to work out the ids of the elements I'm trying to sort, I am able to group them together and then drag drop them as a group, but I don't know how to make it play nice with jquery sortable
[11:05:30] <aracodex123> can anyone give me a tip on where to look ?

[11:23:32] <Ownix> My ASP.NET Web API returns BadRequest(); (400 Bad Request) to the $.ajax(); caller but it runs the .success() method, and an inspection of the response shows it recieved an Status 240. Chrome's Network ispecter tag, and Fiddler both show the response was clearly a status 400. Running out of ideas here.
[11:29:19] <sacho_> Ownix, ...240?
[11:29:32] <Ownix> yeah it doesnt make any sense
[11:29:42] <sacho_> do you have a fiddle to demonstrate?
[11:30:25] <Ownix> Thats not possible since my API isnt reachable from the outside world

[11:58:36] <chriys>  Hi all, I'm trying to modify the content of a #SelectedId from another html file. Basically I want that the content of the input of page 1 update div of page 2
[11:58:40] <chriys> thx in advance
[12:04:15] <bengalol> chriys check load()
[12:04:26] <chriys> ight thx
[12:05:17] <bengalol> or create that action yourself with $.get / $.ajax if you need it modified
[12:06:21] <fatmandown|> Is there a way that I can bind event handlers to elements that haven't been loaded yet?
[12:06:34] <bengalol> with delegation
[12:06:59] <bengalol> basically you tell some parent element to watch if some element within receives that action youre looking for
[12:07:22] <fatmandown|> bengalol: .on()?
[12:07:57] <bengalol> if you have <div id="container"><span></span></div>, you can do $('#
[12:07:59] <bengalol> oops
[12:08:18] <bengalol> you can do $('#container').on('click, 'span', function() { do this });
[12:08:55] <fatmandown|> wow
[12:08:57] <fatmandown|> i'm a fool
[12:09:19] <bengalol> its fine ;)
[12:09:23] <fatmandown|> so I can use .on() to bind to a div I haven't loaded via ajax yet?
[12:09:36] <bengalol> yeah, youre not directly binding it to the element
[12:09:42] <fatmandown|> binding it to a parent that's already present
[12:09:47] <bengalol> right
[12:09:52] <bengalol> at worst that can be $(document)
[12:09:56] <fatmandown|> hot damn, that's something
[12:10:09] <bengalol> but you obviously want it to stick something "closer"
[12:10:19] <fatmandown|> i have a main element that should work
[12:10:22] <bengalol> sure
[12:10:30] <fatmandown|> unfortunately now i have to rewrite the majority of this code
[12:10:36] <fatmandown|> to the red bull store!
[12:10:45] <bengalol> hehe gl
[12:10:50] <fatmandown|> thank you bengalol
[12:10:54] <fatmandown|> have a good one man
[12:10:58] <bengalol> same m8
[12:13:54] <Tralal> hi can someone help me with a function
[12:13:56] <Tralal> any one here
[12:14:19] <jphase> Tralal: don't ask to ask, just ask ;)
[12:15:52] <bengalol> why would u even ask "anyone here?" with 800 ppl in the room? ;)
[12:16:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:18:14] <Tralal> hehe, yea i don't know how to tell my problem so i need to show it with a URL and explain it.
[12:18:36] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ Tralal
[12:18:36] <b-ot> Tralal: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:23:46] <Tralal> Ok here it come, now i have class that creates automaticly based on reaction so the class will multiply, i need to check and if its length is > 140 it must be wrapped. How do i do this with 5 class with the same name. JsFiddle http://jsfiddle.net/kmj30hth/
[12:26:08] <Duvdevan> Tralal wait please, I'm editing your fiddle
[12:28:16] <Duvdevan> Tralal, btw you want the Show more/Show less text to appear under each span.bla item?
[12:32:11] <Tralal> Duvdevan, thats correct
[12:33:51] <Duvdevan> maybe you should use text-overflow: ellipsis;
[12:35:27] <Tralal> Duvdevan: can you show on fiddle ?
[12:35:36] <robertmaxrees> Tralal why not try first?
[12:35:48] <Tralal> try what ?
[12:35:57] <robertmaxrees> using text-overflow: ellipsis; yourself.
[12:36:19] <robertmaxrees> also, your issue with your fiddle is .html() only gets the html of the first thing it matches.
[12:36:43] <Tralal> i don't know how im a beginner
[12:36:50] <robertmaxrees> search google :)
[12:36:53] <robertmaxrees> learn how :)
[12:37:35] <Tralal> or you could help me practice learning faster than reading :)
[12:38:12] <_DB> anyone here familiar with chosen.jquery?
[12:38:14] <robertmaxrees> reading documentation is a skill.
[12:38:20] <robertmaxrees> and a valuable one at that.
[12:39:02] <_DB> I seem to be getting a bug on it cant seem to ifnd any help oon it
[12:39:09] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ _DB
[12:39:10] <b-ot> _DB: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:39:39] <_DB> When I hover over a item in the select box it automatically selects it, but it doesnt show up as selected until the form is submitted
[12:40:09] <_DB> scratch that it always does it
[12:40:27] <robertmaxrees> Tralal i also pointed out that .html() only gets the html for first item in the set - in your case, only for the first '.bla'
[12:41:20] <robertmaxrees> the "right" way to do this is to use CSS and add/remove a class that changes the height and applies the text-overflow property Duvdevan mentioned
[12:44:35] <Tralal> robertmaxrees: yeah but text-overflow will make it 1 large line
[12:45:54] <Jisan> i want to make a scrollable div
[12:46:15] <Jisan> i mean, the contents in it will be scrollable. but there will be no scrollbar
[12:52:45] <chriys> if I modify a line in html file through jquery how can I save it so next time I come it has last modifications?
[12:58:10] <Tralal> Can someone help me, i have class that creates automaticly based on reaction so the class will multiply, i need to check and if its length is > 140 it must be wrapped. How do i do this with 5 class with the same name. JsFiddle http://jsfiddle.net/kmj30hth/
[13:08:26] <mpdude> can i use requirejs to provide a particular version of jquery to my modules when the global $ needs to be another (older) version - *and* the jquery plugins i use are not requriejs/amd aware?
[13:08:37] <mpdude> (and how can i tell for sure if they are or not?)
[13:09:29] <robertmaxrees> you could, but i wouldn't do that.
[13:09:33] <robertmaxrees> use one jquery version.
[13:10:31] <mpdude> i have to integrate into a legacy jquery 1.2 site. so i'd really like to use at least 1.11 :). how could i do it?
[13:10:51] <robertmaxrees> do an upgrade project and get to 1.11
[13:11:02] <snover> global object & plugins can use 1.2, your AMD code can use 1.11 but you can only use modular code & plugins
[13:11:23] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you'll have to define a shim for each version of jquery and then your plugins call the correct one.
[13:11:26] <robertmaxrees> it's going to be gross.
[13:11:31] <mpdude> the plugins i'd like to use now don't work with 1.2
[13:11:39] <robertmaxrees> do the core upgrade
[13:11:43] <robertmaxrees> it's well worth it.
[13:12:01] <mpdude> unfortunately, i cannot convince my customer of that (yet)
[13:12:30] <mpdude> how can i tell if a plugin is "modular code" or amd aware?
[13:12:35] <robertmaxrees> so they're rather increase page weight and execution time?
[13:13:28] <mpdude> currently, 250 hits and 2.7mb
[13:13:30] <robertmaxrees> i'll never understand why some people hire experts and then don't listen to them on stuff like this.
[13:13:45] <mpdude> i cannot  make it worse, do i?
[13:13:54] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:14:03] <robertmaxrees> you could start by not exacerbating the problem.
[13:14:32] <snover> sometimes things need to get worse before they get better
[13:14:50] <robertmaxrees> in this case, they're pretty bad imo.
[13:16:32] <mpdude> any pointers how i should setup the shim, or does that only work with amd-aware plugins?
[13:16:41] <robertmaxrees> the shim is for non-aware ones.
[13:16:59] <mpdude> but they can use the "newer" jq?
[13:17:37] <mpdude> how would the shim (the init function, right?) look like?
[13:17:57] <robertmaxrees> search for it on google.
[13:20:16] <Tralal> Can someone help me, i have class that creates automaticly based on reaction so the class will multiply, i need to check and if its length is > 140 it must be wrapped. How do i do this with 5 class with the same name. JsFiddle http://jsfiddle.net/kmj30hth/
[13:20:53] <robertmaxrees> Tralal what about my explanation earlier did you not understand?
[13:20:57] <robertmaxrees> i gave you two options.
[13:21:16] <Tralal> I tried them but its not what i want
[13:21:29] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[13:21:35] <robertmaxrees> because i don't see how those aren't what you want.
[13:22:14] <Tralal>     white-space: nowrap;      width: 12em;      overflow: hidden;     text-overflow: ellipsis;
[13:22:19] <Tralal> This is just make it one line
[13:22:22] <robertmaxrees> in the fiddle.
[13:23:34] <Tralal> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/kmj30hth/2/
[13:23:38] <robertmaxrees> what about the JS solution I gave you?
[13:24:17] <Tralal> didnt saw that solution ?
[13:24:36] <robertmaxrees> "also, your issue with your fiddle is .html() only gets the html of the first thing it matches."
[13:24:55] <_DB> how can I get the length of all the options in a select, and change the property to selected of just one? (im planing to runa  comparison to a variable I have set)
[13:25:36] <NoiseEee> luckily there's a .length property on jquery collections
[13:25:42] <Tralala> Whats the solution for that one ?
[13:26:00] <robertmaxrees> wrap a container around all your elements and use .html() on the wrapper instead.
[13:26:10] <_DB> so I jst do a .length to the select box?
[13:26:28] <robertmaxrees> _DB on the options in a select
[13:26:34] <robertmaxrees> $('select option').length
[13:26:39] <_DB> ah ok
[13:26:55] <_DB> and how can I change a option to be selected?
[13:27:08] <Tralala> robertmaxrees: i didnt get that one

[13:27:37] <robertmaxrees> Tralala now you have it :)
[13:27:53] <Tralala> robertmaxrees:  yea but i didnt get what you mean with that
[13:28:18] <robertmaxrees> Tralala wrap a new element around all your current ones.
[13:28:35] <robertmaxrees> then use the exact same logic you have now, but select that parent element instead.
[13:30:56] <Tralala> robertmaxrees: do you mean something like this http://jsfiddle.net/kmj30hth/3/
[13:32:33] <robertmaxrees> yeah except don't include your <a> tag
[13:33:08] <Tralala> robertmaxrees: i did but again the second span is not showing ?
[13:33:57] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kmj30hth/4/
[13:33:59] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:34:04] <robertmaxrees> you're doing too much.
[13:34:30] <sssilver> People of jQuery, I have a problem that seems trivial. On my page, I include jQuery and a jQuery plugin. In my Javascript, inside $(function () { // here }); I use that plugin. However, it seems that the plugin hasn't loaded yet at the point when it's being invoked. What's the solution to this?
[13:34:32] <sssilver> Thanks much!
[13:34:53] <robertmaxrees> make sure your code shows up after the plugin include.
[13:35:02] <Tralala> robertmaxrees:  yea, but it must show the second span also wrapped, they are seperated
[13:35:09] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: it surely does
[13:35:14] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: you mean in the DOM right?
[13:35:17] <robertmaxrees> sssilver then show us your code.
[13:35:26] <robertmaxrees> Tralala huh?
[13:35:56] <Tralala> wait i send you URL on PM you can check example

[13:42:43] <robertmaxrees> but thanks.
[13:42:43] <Tralala> !kill sssilver
[13:42:59] <Tralala> _DB what you need?
[13:43:03] <Tralala> Just addClass
[13:43:34] <_DB> http://jsfiddle.net/vrydvkde/  I want to erase its old class , then set a new one but I want to sue find since I have many different <li>'s
[13:43:36] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: got a chance to look at my pastes?
[13:43:55] <robertmaxrees> sssilver lots of stuff to look at.  where are you including this script in question?
[13:43:56] <Tralala> _DB why dont you just use addClass to give a new class ?
[13:43:57] <_DB> im thinking I need to add a id to the <li>
[13:44:02] <_DB> oh ok
[13:44:12] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: line 62 in the HTML
[13:44:44] <Tralala> sssilver:  ooh thats why you being nicely to him sucking his dick, for help
[13:44:46] <Tralala> hahah!
[13:45:03] <_DB> $('chosen-results .li').find(SOME SORT OF ID I IMAGINF ).addClass()?
[13:45:13] <_DB> will something like that work"?
[13:45:52] <robertmaxrees> they won't be able to respond.
[13:46:55] <robertmaxrees> sssilver i'd check to make sure that your scripts aren't 404ing or anything.
[13:47:31] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: they aren't, because right after the page loads if I go into the browser console and do the exact same thing as is written on line 81, it'll work OK
[13:47:55] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[13:48:59] <robertmaxrees> and you're not in a noconflict mode or anything?
[13:50:16] <robertmaxrees> because something here seems... "off":
[13:50:17] <_DB> $('chosen-results .li').addClass('updated-selected');    <-- I want to add some sort of find element here to only select one of the <li>'s should I give the li an id? and use.find(id)
[13:50:21] <_DB> or will taht not work?
[13:50:56] <robertmaxrees> if you give the li an ID, just selectt he ID.
[13:51:04] <robertmaxrees> otherwise give it a class and select that class.
[13:51:08] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: how would I know I am in nonconflict mode?
[13:51:09] <robertmaxrees> .find() is one way to do that.
[13:51:27] <_DB> alright I'll just give ti an id
[13:51:29] <_DB> it**
[13:51:32] <robertmaxrees> sssilver if you're able to use $ the console without issue, that's not likely the case.
[13:51:46] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: I confirm that I am able to do that
[13:52:00] <_DB> ahh wait up
[13:52:12] <_DB> I cant give it an id.. because it is created through a  plugin
[13:52:20] <robertmaxrees> sure you can. .addClass()
[13:52:44] <sssilver> more like attr('id')
[13:53:07] <robertmaxrees> .prop('id', newId) if you want to give it an id.
[13:53:28] <_DB> hmm
[13:53:32] <robertmaxrees> sssilver there aren't any other errors, right?
[13:53:40] <sssilver> nope robertmaxrees
[13:53:47] <_DB> so should I run a for by the length of my selectbox and drop an id on all of them?
[13:53:48] <robertmaxrees> also, you're not loading more than one version of jquery, right?
[13:53:52] <robertmaxrees> there's something funky going on.
[13:53:57] <robertmaxrees> might be an invalid document.
[13:54:12] <robertmaxrees> _DB IDs must be unique.
[13:54:17] <_DB> yeah they will be
[13:54:19] <robertmaxrees> you can't drop the same ID on multiple elements.
[13:54:26] <robertmaxrees> what's all this for anyway?
[13:54:31] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: everything I load is between line 36 and 64
[13:54:56] <_DB> I have a select box that grabs data form my php table, but im using a plugin for a fancy select box
[13:55:02] <robertmaxrees> your html isn't valid btw
[13:55:05] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: that's actually the document pasted from the browser's view source
[13:55:12] <_DB> its a multiple select taht shows which ones ive selected in a input field
[13:55:22] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: it might not be standards-compliant, but it should be valid
[13:55:24] <robertmaxrees> you're missing an <html> for non-IE browsers.
[13:55:41] <_DB> but Im trying to preselect a few options if the user is updating
[13:55:41] <sssilver> oh
[13:55:42] <sssilver> hm
[13:55:56] <_DB> so thats why im tyring to add a class to the <li>'s
[13:56:05] <robertmaxrees> _DB why not preselect from the backend?
[13:56:30] <_DB> because the select box is getting created on the front end
[13:56:53] <_DB> when you press a edit button so i ahve to manually set the pre-selected values
[13:57:08] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:57:51] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see this frontend portion in action, because it shouldn't be tht hard.
[13:57:53] <_DB> so running a for with the length of the options to set a  id to them would be the way to go about it?
[13:58:16] <_DB> then if the user has those in the table (the id would be the same) I can add said class
[13:58:27] <robertmaxrees> the ID can't be the same.
[13:58:36] <robertmaxrees> if they both appear on the same page, the IDs must be different.
[13:58:41] <_DB> the id would be the same as the data from the table I mean?
[13:58:53] <robertmaxrees> can you share a fiddle of what your frontend looks like?
[13:59:05] <_DB> ok I havent added the ids yet
[13:59:33] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to set the value for a select based on a click elsewhere
[13:59:49] <_DB> yeah
[14:00:02] <robertmaxrees> then just set the .val() of the selec.
[14:00:03] <_DB> when you click edit, the select gets filled with backend data
[14:00:04] <robertmaxrees> *select
[14:00:07] <robertmaxrees> that should work
[14:00:29] <_DB> I did that but for some reason it doesnt show up on the input field , displaying the name of the selected value unless I add that class lol
[14:00:53] <_DB> it will be selected and the data will send but it wont show on the UI that its selected
[14:00:58] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: fixed the <html> issue, still the same outcome
[14:01:15] <robertmaxrees> aaaah, that's the point of that.  you could .filter() the options and find the relevant one based on the .value() or something.
[14:01:22] <robertmaxrees> the plugin should have an API to do that.
[14:01:34] <robertmaxrees> sssilver try using $(window).load() instead of the document ready you've got now.
[14:01:36] <_DB> ok
[14:01:38] <robertmaxrees> does that change anything?
[14:02:24] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: yup, that fixed it!
[14:02:33] <robertmaxrees> sssilver then your page is invalid.
[14:02:40] <robertmaxrees> that's why the window load would work.
[14:02:48] <sssilver> hmm
[14:03:01] <robertmaxrees> the document ready is firing prematurely because jquery can't figure out when it SHOULD fire.
[14:03:06] <sssilver> I see
[14:03:09] <sssilver> I'll fix the DOM then
[14:03:12] <sssilver> thanks so much
[14:03:13] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[14:03:21] <robertmaxrees> of course.  sorry it took so long to figure out :D
[14:03:21] <sssilver> perhaps I should grow a beard or something
[14:03:26] <sssilver> have you got a beard?
[14:03:30] <robertmaxrees> nah. goatee.
[14:03:34] <sssilver> that's a beard
[14:03:37] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[14:03:42] <sssilver> I KNEW IT
[14:03:49] * sssilver is off to growing a beard
[14:27:35] <stangeland> How do i add 3 lines to this web-plot instead of only 1 ? http://jsfiddle.net/9k3qyggg/
[14:29:17] <NoiseEee> stangeland: read the Bokeh documentation I guess
[14:32:13] <_DB> <li class="active-result" style="" data-option-array-index="12">the newest art object</li>    is there anyway to use .find to get this <li>
[14:32:29] <robertmaxrees> .find('.active-result')
[14:32:43] <_DB> yeah but that will return each of its kind no?
[14:32:54] <robertmaxrees> that'll return all of them with that class, yeah.
[14:33:00] <_DB> I ahve a bunch of <li>s with the same class
[14:33:09] <_DB> can i find it by its data element?
[14:33:16] <robertmaxrees> sure - attribute selector.
[14:33:20] <robertmaxrees> though that'll be slow-ish
[14:33:28] <_DB> really
[14:34:12] <robertmaxrees> and not guaranteed since data attributes get set different ways.  you could .filter() the .active-result lis you find.
[14:34:28] <_DB> but filter it with what?
[14:34:34] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs.
[14:34:38] <robertmaxrees> they'll tell you how :)
[14:34:42] <_DB> they dont ahve ids just data-elements
[14:34:53] <robertmaxrees> you can filter on anything.
[14:35:05] <robertmaxrees> return $(this).data('array-index') === 11;
[14:35:09] <robertmaxrees> something like that.
[14:36:47] <_DB> it returned false?
[14:37:07] <Duvdevan> return $(this).data('array-index') === '11';
[14:38:26] <_DB> same thing
[14:38:41] <robertmaxrees> or 12 or whatever value you want.
[14:38:57] <_DB> perhaps its returning false because it is not selected?
[14:40:02] <_DB> or perhaps I have to add option since it is data-option-array...
[14:41:03] <_DB> I used console.log
[14:41:09] <_DB> when it returned false?
[14:51:00] <_DB> :{
[14:51:02] <_DB> :[
[14:51:32] <_DB> $('option').prop('selected', false);   that deselects everything in the select box im using
[14:51:41] <_DB> anyway I can add a filter to it by the data-element?
[14:54:35] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: OK so apparently my HTML was alright
[14:54:39] <sssilver> it was all caused by this
[14:54:42] <sssilver> https://gethelium.com/docs/helium.js#advanced-ready
[14:54:48] <sssilver> which is something I was using
[14:54:51] <sssilver> (and still am)
[14:55:10] <sssilver> now I'm not sure if  $('#Helium').on('ready', function) is actually better than $(window)
[14:55:48] <_DB> as in window reasy?
[14:55:54] <_DB> ready**
[14:56:29] <sssilver> yeah
[14:56:31] <_DB> i hears that is not as good to use as document.ready because the window can load before the document does.
[14:56:50] <_DB> if I get all the children of a element..
[14:56:57] <_DB> would the children be sent to an array?
[14:57:06] <_DB> as in parent[0] would return the first child?
[15:11:22] <_DB> http://jsfiddle.net/p5cqyry6/
[15:11:32] <_DB> can anyone help me with that script doesnt seem to update my children
[15:11:43] <_DB> theyre are late bloomers for some reason lol ;)
[15:12:46] <_DB> its giving me a empty array
[15:14:38] <decx> addclass has a built in loop for collections
[15:15:28] <_DB> can I not grab the children of a <ul>
[15:15:40] <_DB> im tyring to get a array of <li>'s to loop through them
[15:15:51] <Woet> _DB: turn it into a working jsfiddle please.
[15:16:31] <_DB> ok
[15:17:15] <Snerf> I would use $.each as well, no need for an array like such
[15:17:25] <_DB> http://jsfiddle.net/p5cqyry6/1/
[15:17:45] <_DB> well the thing is im tryint to change the class of certain ones
[15:18:00] <_DB> im not to sure how to keep track of a each
[15:18:24] <Snerf> using $(this) inside of it
[15:18:55] <_DB> but how will it now what $this is?
[15:19:22] <Snerf> how do you know which to change , to begin with ?
[15:19:42] <_DB> because they are printed in the order they come from the backend
[15:19:51] <_DB> so im going to edit in the order of the backend
[15:20:29] <Snerf> you said you wanted to change the class of certain ones.. what certain ones?
[15:21:05] <_DB> planning to have an id that compares one of the columns on the backend
[15:21:11] <_DB> an if** not id
[15:21:31] <_DB> so if (id_of backend is one of the elemts ) change its class
[15:21:59] <Snerf> and that id is the data-option-array-index ?
[15:22:10] <_DB> no that array is set by the plugin
[15:22:25] <Snerf> ok, you've lost me there.. too much info missing.
[15:22:34] <_DB> ideally if I could somehow get the element by that data-element and change its class then I would use that
[15:22:54] <_DB> but idk how to which is why im looping through the children
[15:23:27] <Snerf> $(this).data('option-array-index') is how you can check for that value
[15:23:52] <_DB> I have 12 different <li> with taht data elements
[15:24:07] <_DB> how would $this know which one?
[15:24:13] <Snerf> yes, but all different values, correct?
[15:24:17] <_DB> yeah
[15:24:25] <Snerf> then just check em in the loop
[15:24:33] <Snerf> what the value is
[15:24:58] <_DB> in which loop?
[15:25:04] <Snerf> the $.each one
[15:25:22] <_DB> well I ahve to get that loop working
[15:25:30] <_DB> thats whats giving me problems right now
[15:25:52] <_DB> its saying ti has no children
[15:25:57] <Snerf> well, get moving on it.. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[15:27:37] <Snerf> $('ul.chosen-results > li').each(function(i,j) { ... etc etc
[15:30:10] <_DB> same thing its returning a length of 0
[15:30:20] <Snerf> paste yer code
[15:31:03] <_DB> http://jsfiddle.net/p5cqyry6/3/
[15:31:17] <_DB> it works on the fiddle but not on my side
[15:31:26] <_DB> and all my other jquery code works
[15:31:55] <Snerf> then you have a misnamed object or such, check your console
[15:32:10] <Snerf> because the code works, as you can see
[15:33:03] <Snerf> maybe your running the code to soon, and no <li>'s have been added, etc, stuff like that could be too
[15:33:09] <_DB> that ul is created via a plugin
[15:33:36] <_DB> thats what im thinking but before I run this script I update the list
[15:33:43] <Snerf> yes, perhaps its still empty when your running the code
[15:33:43] <_DB> and its created prior
[15:34:03] <Snerf> do a console log of the ul then, you can see what it sees
[15:34:11] <Snerf> my guess, its empty
[15:35:13] <_DB> it has a length of 4
[15:35:26] <_DB> which is wrong I have 12 elements in it
[15:36:38] <Snerf> just do a console log of $('ul.chosen-results').html() and you will know what it sees
[15:36:54] <Snerf> save yourself the grief, do some debugging
[15:38:29] <ninegordon> lol there is a key on this channel yo
[15:38:40] <_DB> EMPTY!
[15:38:42] <_DB> lol
[15:38:46] <Snerf> ya, I noticed the +k added :)
[15:39:01] <_DB> alright ill just make my own select function tomorrow
[15:39:04] <KindOne> robertmaxrees, you screwed up the channel, remove that +k
[15:39:09] <Snerf> well, there ya go.. your running the code to soon
[15:39:11] <_DB> I was trying to use a plugin the theme came with nvm  that though
[15:39:35] <KindOne> ... or that
[15:39:36] <_DB> +k _DB
[15:39:42] <_DB> +k
[15:39:46] <ninegordon> +lol
[15:39:47] <_DB> alright later dudes
[15:39:57] <_DB> cya tomorrokw
[15:40:56] <robertmaxrees> s00pcanwiios,  ny vad,'
[15:41:02] <robertmaxrees> oah wtf.
[15:41:24] <robertmaxrees> snover thank you - that was probably my bad.
[15:41:40] <snover> it was a good key though
[15:43:06] <robertmaxrees> hahaha right!?
[15:43:21] <robertmaxrees> i was modding a little too quickly earlier.  we had somebody that was being a little... intense.
[15:43:44] <hak> Hello is there a way to not target element with each?
[15:44:11] <robertmaxrees> you mean like skip an element in an each?
[15:46:21] <hak> robertmaxrees: yes
[15:46:37] <robertmaxrees> you can return false; out of the function iirc.
[15:46:42] <Snerf> hak, try .not instead of .each , if it has a different class or such, or even .filter works too
[15:49:41] <mAxX--> did anyone used the masonry plugin?
[15:49:43] <hak> Problem is that, I have wordpress theme. My theme has option to use one page navigation. Using this code http://pastebin.com/ckRS0XdX. What it does it gets all menu items in navigation and their links (#ID). And moves your screen to the element with ID. I need to disable this script for my menu with href="#agenda". Is there a way?
[15:50:56] <pool> hey there, is there any way to download all the jquery api on chm or something like that? i mean like the php one
[15:51:21] <robertmaxrees> hak you're trying to replicate native browser behavior...
[15:51:31] <robertmaxrees> pool "on chm or something"?
[15:52:54] <pool> its a compiled html file on windows
[15:53:00] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean the docs?.
[15:53:07] <pool> yes
[15:53:50] <robertmaxrees> looks like somebody has http://jqapi.com/
[15:53:51] <pool> but they are more readable on that extension
[15:55:04] <reyley> hello guys if i want to show a dialog box, should i have the div already on the page hidden and use js to set it visible or use js to render the html?
[15:55:57] <mAxX--> did anyone use the masonry plugin?
[15:56:07] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ mAxX--
[15:56:12] <b-ot> mAxX--: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:56:20] <robertmaxrees> reyley depends.
[15:56:26] <printForever> guys, still nothing
[15:56:36] <robertmaxrees> if you can put the html on your page in your backend, do that.
[15:56:52] <printForever> I need to trigger jQuery after another jQuery script has completed POST
[15:57:09] <printForever> how do I trigger jQuery after POST
[15:57:11] <reyley> robertmaxrees: alright
[15:57:18] <robertmaxrees> "trigger jquery"?
[15:57:20] <printForever> and how do I target that specific POST
[15:57:26] <robertmaxrees> printForever what do you mean?
[15:57:30] <printForever> well, the function is not being triggered
[15:57:38] <robertmaxrees> how are you trying to run it?
[15:57:41] <printForever> ok. I have an accordion tabs, that are filled based on user decisions
[15:57:56] <printForever> Step 1 is filled, but Step 2, 3 and 4 are not
[15:58:23] <printForever> once user clicks on input[type="submit"] Step 2 is loaded
[15:58:28] <printForever> and shown
[15:58:45] <printForever> my problem is, that I wrote the script that is changing something in the Step 4
[15:59:05] <printForever> since there is no HTML for Step 4 (its not loaded, because the user needs to go through steps 1, 2 and 3)
[15:59:13] <printForever> the jQuery does nothing
[15:59:19] <printForever> and does not affect the Step 4
[15:59:42] <printForever> my question is, how do I get it to interact with Step 4 content, after POST for Step 4 is completed
[15:59:49] <printForever> and the HTML is loaded on the page
[15:59:58] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to abstract your logic so that when step 4 is loaded, you call that logic explicitly.
[16:00:23] <printForever> ok, sure, but... I'm not that skilled
[16:00:26] <printForever> I need an example
[16:00:32] <printForever> or some sort of explanation
[16:00:45] <robertmaxrees> are you using $.post()?
[16:01:03] <printForever> I cant change anything relating to the original accordion steps script
[16:01:18] <printForever> so I cant change the current code
[16:01:24] <printForever> if I could, it would be simple
[16:01:39] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to understand if you're using ajax to post or if you're reloading the page.
[16:01:46] <printForever> ajax
[16:02:07] <robertmaxrees> could you edit the ajax calls to include a .done() callback?
[16:02:18] <printForever> :( no
[16:02:41] <robertmaxrees> you could use a global ajax event listener, check out the URL that was just posted to or whatever, and call your logic in there.
[16:02:55] <printForever> the same url is requested all the time
[16:03:10] <printForever> https://www.domain.com/remote.php
[16:03:41] <robertmaxrees> then you'll have to register a listener that listens for clicks on each of those accordions and, when you've clicked to correct one, it sets a boolean you check against for that ajax event listener.
[16:04:09] <printForever> I have an ID for the div I want to access
[16:04:13] <hak> How exactly should I use .not() where I want to select all elements in div but one
[16:04:16] <printForever> but I cant access it, because its not there
[16:04:39] <robertmaxrees> printForever that isn't related with what i'm saying/
[16:04:50] <printForever> hak, you have several ways... simplest is to count the DIV you want to remove and assign the number
[16:05:02] <printForever> robertmaxrees, sorry... I dont follow :(
[16:05:03] <robertmaxrees> is the code you're trying to re-run something you can't modify?
[16:05:23] <printForever> I can modify the code I want to re-run
[16:05:41] <robertmaxrees> can you pull it out into its own function?
[16:05:47] <printForever> I just cant modify the current code that is doing the IF's for Step 1, 2, 3 and 4
[16:05:55] <printForever> yes I can
[16:06:07] <printForever> it currently is in its own function
[16:06:23] <robertmaxrees> okay - so register an event listener for clicks on those tabs or whatever they are.
[16:06:39] <printForever> :( how do I register an event listener :(
[16:06:42] <robertmaxrees> .on()
[16:07:07] <printForever> so... for example: $('input[type="submit"]').on(function () {
[16:07:12] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:07:24] <printForever> and why does .click fail to work?
[16:07:36] <robertmaxrees> it'd be .on('click'
[16:07:44] <robertmaxrees> do those buttons exist on pageload?
[16:08:10] <printForever> :) yes. I had an idea. because every step, has an <input type="submit"> I will target that button
[16:08:15] <printForever> until the last Step is loaded
[16:08:17] <printForever> :D
[16:08:29] <robertmaxrees> a few different ways to do it.
[16:08:33] <robertmaxrees> whatever floats your boat.
[16:08:42] <printForever> and it should change the HTML in the last step, once the next to last <input type="submit"> is hit
[16:09:00] <robertmaxrees> except that the html won't techniucally be loaded by then.
[16:09:06] <robertmaxrees> unless it's already on the page somehow.
[16:09:29] <printForever> its on the page before <input type="submit"> is pressed in Step 3
[16:09:32] <printForever> its just hidden
[16:09:36] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[16:09:49] <robertmaxrees> and the content you need is there?
[16:09:53] <printForever> yes
[16:10:03] <robertmaxrees> good times then.
[16:10:05] <printForever> .on() listens for all the changes in HTML?
[16:10:09] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:10:12] <printForever> o.0
[16:10:12] <robertmaxrees> .on('click'
[16:10:16] <robertmaxrees> that 's waht you need.
[16:10:34] <robertmaxrees> .click() maps to .on('click' under the hood.
[16:10:36] <printForever> yeah, but it will work every time the POST is completed
[16:10:57] <printForever> I mean, it wont stop "listening" after the inital load
[16:11:06] <robertmaxrees> printForever i'm not sure what you mean.
[16:11:06] <printForever> it will keep listening all the time
[16:11:12] <printForever> :(
[16:11:15] <robertmaxrees> it's just like click.
[16:11:19] <robertmaxrees> you bind once.
[16:11:21] <robertmaxrees> it works.
[16:11:24] <robertmaxrees> as long as the element is there.
[16:11:51] <printForever> page loads, ajax does x3 POST, so the initial HTML is changed 3x
[16:12:12] <printForever> my question was, will .on() keep working and "listening" after each POST
[16:12:13] <robertmaxrees> that changing html is impo9rtant.
[16:12:18] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener instead.
[16:12:28] <printForever> there we go... thats what I was asking
[16:12:51] <printForever> because I knew that jQuery function cant update itself to listen for HTML changes
[16:13:03] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:13:07] <robertmaxrees> nor should it :)
[16:13:10] <printForever> :)))
[16:13:14] <printForever> ok, so I cant use .on
[16:13:18] <printForever> what do I use?
[16:13:19] <robertmaxrees> yes you can.
[16:13:26] <printForever> lol, confused
[16:13:35] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('click', 'input[type="submit"]', function() {});
[16:13:44] <robertmaxrees> where parent is an ancestor that doesn't get swapped out.
[16:14:21] <printForever> there will always be <input type="submit"> on the page, even after 3x POST is done
[16:14:28] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:14:34] <printForever> :( sorry
[16:14:35] <robertmaxrees> you're replacing them though.
[16:14:39] <robertmaxrees> the original html is getting replaced.
[16:14:44] <robertmaxrees> that breaks the reference.
[16:14:54] <printForever> well... sort of... the original is hidden with CSS, and the new one is shown
[16:14:56] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't matter if it's the same structure.
[16:15:01] <robertmaxrees> dioesn't matter.
[16:15:02] <printForever> the new one is loaded and shown
[16:15:10] <printForever> oh
[16:15:14] <robertmaxrees> the new one doesn't have the event hndler bound to it.
[16:15:23] <printForever> so... I should use
[16:15:53] <printForever> $('body').on('click', 'input[type="submit"]', function() {});
[16:16:12] <robertmaxrees> does everything in body get replaced?
[16:16:16] <printForever> no
[16:16:19] <robertmaxrees> bind lower down if possible.
[16:16:22] <printForever> ouh
[16:16:23] <printForever> ok
[16:16:32] <robertmaxrees> i mean, that'll work, it's just not ideal.
[16:16:38] <printForever> it doesent need to be direct parent
[16:16:38] <hak> printForever: I dont think I understand the .not() here is my simple example http://jsfiddle.net/3mym23wn/1/ Is there an easy way to do it?
[16:16:41] <printForever> it can be few levels up
[16:17:28] <printForever> hak, which one do you want to select?
[16:17:31] <printForever> or... not select
[16:17:41] <printForever> #5
[16:17:48] <hak> select all but #5
[16:17:53] <printForever> ok
[16:18:23] <robertmaxrees> hak http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3mym23wn/3/
[16:18:36] <printForever> robertmaxrees, beat me to it
[16:18:37] <printForever> :)))
[16:18:56] <printForever> I noticed that first thing was you were selecting the wrong thing A instead of LI
[16:19:12] <printForever> robertmaxrees is fast :D
[16:19:56] <hak> robertmaxrees: I changed it a little bit. Is this OK http://jsfiddle.net/3mym23wn/4/ ?
[16:20:13] <robertmaxrees> hak why do you need the .each() in there?
[16:20:27] <robertmaxrees> 9/10 times you don't actually need it.
[16:21:40] <hak> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/ckRS0XdX I need to do exactly same here (ignore #5) as in the simplified example.
[16:23:18] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:24:15] <printForever> dafuq
[16:24:22] <robertmaxrees> btw any time you have e.preventDefault(); and e.stopPropagation(); at the same time, you can use a single e.stopImmediatePropagation();
[16:25:46] <hak> Pastebin I linked selects all links in navigation. I need to ignore one. Same as here http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3mym23wn/3/
[16:25:53] <hak> Because
[16:26:24] <robertmaxrees> hak your pastebin code will never work because you have an IIFE you never un.
[16:26:26] <robertmaxrees> *run
[16:26:50] <robertmaxrees> also, you have a document ready in a document ready.
[16:26:54] <hak> robertmaxrees: http://178.62.186.10/event/gem-forum/ here it works
[16:28:27] <robertmaxrees> you see what i had to change in that fiddle?
[16:29:04] <hak> yes you changed anchor to li
[16:29:52] <printForever> robertmaxrees, it didnt work :((((((((
[16:30:14] <demifuror> hi guys, i want to make a web page with "hello". i want "hello" to take up the full width and/or height of the viewport, but without skewing the text. is this possible? so i want to have the word "hello" take up as much of the width and height of the viewport available, without  affecting the proportions of the text
[16:30:16] <robertmaxrees> printForever "it didn't work" doesn't help.  can you make a fiddle?
[16:30:33] <printForever> robertmaxrees, I can only paste my code
[16:31:02] <robertmaxrees> printForever a test case would be helpful - emulate the eajax stuff if you need to.
[16:31:23] <printForever> :/ well... I would if I knew how to do it :(
[16:33:32] <printForever> robertmaxrees, if I remove 'click' from $('.ExpressCheckout').on('click', 'input[type="submit"]', function () {
[16:34:04] <printForever> and I remove input typpe submit
[16:34:09] <printForever> how would .on work then?
[16:34:20] <robertmaxrees> it wouldn't.
[16:34:21] <printForever> would it still try to apply changes after each POST?
[16:34:24] <robertmaxrees> .on() needs an event.
[16:34:32] <robertmaxrees> the first arg must be an event.
[16:34:39] <printForever> can it be .on() after POST?
[16:34:54] <robertmaxrees> you need a global ajax event listener at that point
[16:35:07] <printForever> how do I get one of those?
[16:35:30] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery global ajax events
[16:35:31] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: Global Ajax Event Handlers | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/global-ajax-event-handlers/
[16:35:55] <printForever> :D I pasted it in google
[16:36:00] <printForever> and got it before the bot
[16:36:07] <printForever> but... which one do I use?
[16:36:14] <robertmaxrees> read around ;)
[16:36:25] <printForever> awww man :D its 1:36 AM
[16:36:26] <printForever> :D
[16:36:30] <printForever> help a brother out
[16:36:42] <robertmaxrees> read the short descriptions under each one.
[16:37:13] <printForever> .ajaxComplete() or .ajaxSuccess() ?
[16:37:48] <robertmaxrees> guess.
[16:38:05] <printForever> well...
[16:38:12] <printForever> .ajaxSuccess()
[16:38:16] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:38:38] <printForever> because its executed whenever an Ajax request is completed successfully
[16:39:12] <printForever> thats different from the .ajaxComplete() because .ajaxCompete() could be with errors
[16:41:13] <printForever> robertmaxrees, am I correct?
[16:41:27] <robertmaxrees> that's what the docs will tell you, tes.
[16:41:30] <robertmaxrees> *yes
[16:41:45] <printForever> thank you :)
[16:42:49] <printForever> still, a dud
[16:43:51] <robertmaxrees> and you're binding to the document?
[16:43:59] <printForever> oh crap
[16:44:05] <printForever> I left the .on click stuff
[16:48:06] <printForever> robertmaxrees, is tehre a way I can add alert or something
[16:48:11] <printForever> to check if the jQ is firing
[16:48:53] <robertmaxrees> use console.log()
[16:49:03] <robertmaxrees> or learn to use your step debugger.
[16:50:51] <printForever> :(
[16:51:03] <printForever> how would one test with console.log()?
[16:51:17] <soahccc> call it an watch your console
[16:51:19] <robertmaxrees> edit the code to add one in
[17:00:19] <printForever> its confirmed .ajaxSuccess() does not work
[17:04:17] <robertmaxrees> you're probably misusing it.
[17:09:50] <printForever> robertmaxrees http://pastebin.com/knNRwNu6
[17:10:34] <printForever> why wont it fire? at all
[17:10:36] <robertmaxrees> document
[17:10:50] <printForever> ?
[17:10:52] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/
[17:10:55] <printForever> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12325113/jquery-ajax-ajaxsuccess-event-not-firing
[17:11:00] <robertmaxrees> "As of jQuery 1.8, the .ajaxComplete() method should only be attached to document."
[17:11:07] <printForever> it didnt work
[17:11:09] <printForever> I tried it
[17:11:16] <robertmaxrees> then i have no clue man
[17:11:28] <printForever> oh boy\
[17:11:34] <robertmaxrees> ot
[17:11:43] <robertmaxrees> *it's real hard to help in cases like this.
[17:12:05] <printForever> can I check in console.log
[17:12:11] <printForever> which version of jQ is loaded?
[17:12:18] <robertmaxrees> $.fn.jquery
[17:12:30] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you need to learn how to use your debugger at this point.
[17:12:42] <printForever> 1.7.2
[17:12:50] <robertmaxrees> that's going to cause a lot of problems.
[17:12:55] <robertmaxrees> can you update it?
[17:13:01] <printForever> I can force update
[17:13:14] <soahccc> printForever: that update might break thing
[17:13:17] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:13:24] <robertmaxrees> 1.9 has a lot of breaking changes.
[17:13:26] <robertmaxrees> 1.9 and above
[17:13:31] <printForever> dont care
[17:13:37] <robertmaxrees> then update to 1.11.1
[17:13:40] <printForever> I am
[17:15:33] <printForever> loaded 1.11.1
[17:15:44] <printForever> still working
[17:15:53] <printForever> I mean, its still performing
[17:16:47] <printForever> ?! it changed back to 1.7.2
[17:16:51] <printForever> ?! how???
[17:17:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:18:05] <Robdgreat> http://i.imgur.com/96t6I9m.gif
[17:19:07] <printForever> its back to 1.11.1, porbably didnt load
[17:19:14] <printForever> but not even a single alert box
[17:19:16] <printForever> nothing
[17:19:19] <printForever> absolutely nothing
[17:22:19] <robertmaxrees> console errors?
[17:23:55] <printForever> nope
[17:23:58] <printForever> everything working fine
[17:24:06] <robertmaxrees> you said it was broken.
[17:24:07] <printForever> except, there is no ajaxSuccess
[17:24:23] <printForever> yes, .ajaxSuccess is not doing anything
[17:24:40] <robertmaxrees> and the ajax post is using the jquery ajax post?
[17:24:51] <printForever> yes
[17:24:55] <robertmaxrees> change that to the ajaxComplete
[17:24:57] <robertmaxrees> or whatever it was.
[17:25:11] <robertmaxrees> maybe the request isn't successfully finishing?
[17:27:45] <printForever> robertmaxrees how do I use this (function($) { ......oldcodehere.... }(jQuery))
[17:27:58] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean.
[17:28:08] <printForever> jQuery instead of $
[17:28:08] <robertmaxrees> that's an IIFE.
[17:28:15] <robertmaxrees> that's how you use it.
[17:28:26] <robertmaxrees> put your old code where is says to put it.
[17:28:38] <printForever> ajaxComplete and all?
[17:28:49] <robertmaxrees> are you in noconflict?
[17:28:59] <robertmaxrees> ie do you have to use jQuery instead of $?
[17:29:33] <printForever> no, but...
[17:29:44] <printForever> like this?
[17:29:44] <printForever> (function($) {
[17:29:44] <printForever> 		jQuery(document).ajaxSuccess(function() {
[17:30:26] <robertmaxrees> err.
[17:30:31] <robertmaxrees> you use $ in there at that point
[17:30:38] <robertmaxrees> the whole point of that IIFE is so you can use $.
[17:30:58] <robertmaxrees> $ is a shortcut for jQuery\
[17:31:03] <printForever> (function($) { jQuery(document).ajaxComplete(function() { alert("Your book is overdue."); }); }); }(jQuery))
[17:31:10] <printForever> I know that
[17:31:20] <printForever> right now I'm desparate
[17:31:21] <robertmaxrees> then why are you using it?
[17:31:35] <robertmaxrees> that's not what you use it for.
[17:32:38] <printForever> nope, still no alert, no nothing
[17:32:56] <robertmaxrees> go to your network panel.
[17:33:05] <robertmaxrees> are the ajax events running?
[17:33:57] <sammych1> so suppose you send a request out, and you connection to that server, does the fail callback immediately fire?
[17:34:03] <sammych1> oops
[17:34:07] <sammych1> lose connection*
[17:34:20] <robertmaxrees> sammych1 it should iirc.
[17:34:24] <printForever> robertmaxrees, yes they are
[17:34:39] <robertmaxrees> printForever then I have no clue.
[17:34:53] <printForever> robertmaxrees who would?
[17:35:02] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[17:36:26] <sammych1> might be a network stack related question
[17:36:49] <sammych1> you'd have to completely lose connection, basically, your TCP session dies
[17:36:54] <printForever> ...
[17:37:00] <printForever> 200 OK
[17:37:02] <printForever> 200 OK
[17:37:26] <robertmaxrees> sammych1 it might have to timeout first.
[17:37:57] <sammych1> because in Chome, it prints an error to console somethin glike ERR_NET_DISCONNECT
[17:38:26] <printForever> I can test in Chrome
[17:38:31] <robertmaxrees> sammych1 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11044694/how-to-detect-ajax-call-failure-due-to-network-disconnected
[17:38:43] <robertmaxrees> that might help?
[17:40:02] <sammych1> has interesting thoughts, if no answers :)
[17:40:46] <printForever> same story
[17:40:52] <printForever> there was no network disconnect
[17:41:05] <robertmaxrees> printForever i think we're tlaking about something different...
[17:41:06] <sammych1> I think it's the same idea as me. I want to know if my long reqeust (can take minutes to respond) will resume if the mobile user, say, loses cellular as they were in a lift or something
[17:42:01] <sammych1> I guess it's a problem I'll experiment with later. Not a big deal atm
[17:42:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah i wouldn't worry about it for now.
[17:42:51] <printForever> guys
[17:42:56] <printForever> is tehre some paid support or something
[17:43:07] <printForever> this is really getting on my nerves
[17:45:52] <robertmaxrees> printForever not really.
[17:45:55] <pilgrimish> Is there a sure fire way of replacing select menus with a ul and allowing the menu to still filter results?
[17:45:59] <robertmaxrees> you said it's like 2:00 in the morning, printForever?
[17:46:29] <robertmaxrees> why not go to sleep and try again in the morning?
[17:47:34] <sammych1> pilgrimish: what menu to filter?
[17:48:03] <printForever> robertmaxrees, I told a client that there is nothing I can do
[17:48:10] <printForever> I spent ~5 hours on it today
[17:48:12] <printForever> with no change
[17:48:19] <printForever> its 2:48 right now
[17:48:53] <pilgrimish> sammych1: http://dev.munroe.com/our-work/ i want to style this menu, but i can’t do it as a select/option so i’ve been trying the various jquery options for switching from select to ul, but i can’t get anything that sticks OR if it does stick, allows the menu to continue working
[17:49:08] <sammych1> damn, I missed out on that puzzle.
[17:52:26] <sammych1> okay. so it submits when you change. What you can do is hide those selects, build the widget, then when the widget sees a change, update the hidden original select and fire change or submit the form
[17:54:26] <sammych1> so you're still using the original select, the form works without much change
[17:54:41] <pilgrimish> right, and the query strings compile and update
[17:54:48] <pilgrimish> it’s using a plugin
[17:54:50] <pilgrimish> in wp
[17:55:32] <pilgrimish> so i’d build that widget in jquery, a sort of event listener?
[18:00:26] <sup3r> hi
[18:01:11] <sup3r> I need an opinion...
[18:01:47] <hyperking> sup3r: whats up?
[18:02:00] <sup3r> my website
[18:02:02] <sup3r> with jquery
[18:02:08] <sup3r> http://www.wecases.com/criar
[18:02:31] <sup3r> opnion for usability
[18:02:50] <hyperking> i speak english
[18:03:23] <hyperking> whats your question?
[18:03:36] <sup3r> ow so sorry my website is in Portuguese
[18:03:57] <sup3r> in internet explorer it shows the warning slow
[18:04:19] <sup3r> it is possible to do some maneuvering to improve this warning
[18:04:24] <sup3r> ie8
[18:04:46] <hyperking> im using chrome, but the layout looks typical for app software...very bootstrappy
[18:05:03] <robertmaxrees> IE8?
[18:05:17] <sup3r> no use bootstrap
[18:05:56] <sup3r> the system needs to be functional in IE8 due to my location still have many hits with ie8
[18:06:00] <sup3r> :-/
[18:06:09] <robertmaxrees> that's fair - i have to support it still, too.
[18:06:25] <sup3r> yeah
[18:06:30] <robertmaxrees> put your JS into separate script files.
[18:06:43] <sup3r> hum...
[18:06:43] <robertmaxrees> try to upgrade to a more recent version of JQ
[18:07:25] <pilgrimish> sammych1: is this what you’re referencing, or something like it:
[18:07:26] <pilgrimish> http://api.jqueryui.com/selectmenu/
[18:07:26] <sup3r> to update must review all the code to fit the new changes
[18:07:41] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:07:58] <robertmaxrees> also stuff like $(document).bind('click', function(e) { is a little weird.
[18:08:31] <sup3r> very weird
[18:08:56] <robertmaxrees> try to bind that listener a little lower in the document.
[18:09:14] <sup3r> ok
[18:09:18] <robertmaxrees> not really sure why IE8 is throwing a warning though.
[18:09:41] <sup3r> I will review for new version and separate the functions calling only I will use on the page
[18:09:50] <sup3r> maybe this helps
[18:10:33] <sup3r> yes ... also found it odd nothing too complex to show this warning
[18:10:45] <sup3r> ie sux
[18:10:51] <robertmaxrees> IE is fine.
[18:10:56] <robertmaxrees> users suck ;)
[18:10:56] <sup3r> rs
[18:11:04] <sup3r> ow OK
[18:11:14] <robertmaxrees> you'd have firefox if you still had to support 3.6
[18:11:20] <robertmaxrees> *hate firefox, i mean
[18:12:30] <sup3r> not find interesting program for many browsers when the references should be the same
[18:12:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:13:35] <sup3r> My English is bad
[18:13:37] <sup3r> so bad
[18:13:39] <sup3r> sorry
[18:13:46] <robertmaxrees> it's fine.
[18:16:29] <sup3r> I also have another doubt ... help 'clone' in ios system ...
[18:16:29] <sup3r> revert this faulty
[18:17:03] <sup3r> with the content in a div with overflow
[18:17:28] <sup3r> I had to remove "clone" after drop
[18:17:39] <sup3r> and disable revert
[18:18:35] <limbera> hi all
[18:18:50] <limbera> i'm having some trouble using JWT (JSON web token) and jquery ajax post
[18:19:17] <limbera> this code http://dpaste.com/3H9YE89
[18:19:20] <limbera> returns a HTTP401
[18:20:20] <sup3r> limbera
[18:20:22] <limbera> but when i use the same credentials using curl
[18:20:37] <limbera> it returns the token (i.e. it works)
[18:20:39] <limbera> yes sup3r
[18:21:10] <sup3r> one momment
[18:21:13] <sup3r> see your code
[18:21:17] <limbera> thank you very much
[18:33:20] <chriys> Hi all, when I modify a line of my html page, how can I save those changes throught jQuery ?
[18:34:28] <sup3r> post
[18:34:58] <sup3r> what would be the content of the line?
[18:37:49] <sup3r> chriys
[18:38:27] <chriys> well I'll just add a new text in a div from an input
[18:38:59] <sup3r> after save?
[18:39:26] <chriys> basically if I type "hi" in the input, it affects the div then next time i come on the page I would like to see what I wrote the last time.
[18:39:32] <chriys> Yeah after save.
[18:39:48] <BillCris_> Oh.
[18:40:01] <BillCris_> Keep all the old valued stores in an array.
[18:40:21] <sup3r> what would be the storage format, session, cookie or db?
[18:42:18] <BillCris_> A regular array can work unless you want to keep it across multiple pages.
[18:42:33] <BillCris_> and page loads and shit.
[18:44:14] <sammych1> this might be device/viewport specific: I have this ancient device running a webapp on Android 4. I have a font-awesome spinner going and it's massacring the CPU whenever it's visible
[18:44:53] <sammych1> question is, is the display thread lower priority than logic?
[18:44:59] <sammych1> well, the JS thread
[18:45:31] <sammych1> because would it overall performance much if I removed the animation?
[18:46:14] <sammych1> oops: improve performance much*
[18:47:09] <sammych1> because atm, if the spinner is spinning, it means it's waiting on a callback/request, but it's if it's not spinning, it's actually doing something
[18:48:07] <sup3r> chriys: http://pastebin.com/HLazYChE
[18:48:14] <sammych1> no one? oh well...
[18:48:27] <sup3r>  chriys: use key up
[18:48:52] <chriys> key up is better that on(blur ... ?
[18:49:36] <chriys> sup3r: how does it save the changes ?
[18:50:22] <sup3r> one moment
[18:50:39] <sup3r> chriys: http://jsfiddle.net/GrMQX/5/ see this
[18:50:43] <sup3r> yout choice
[18:50:46] <sup3r> your*
[18:52:34] <shebbi> What's the general rule regarding putting HTML in jquery? should HTML be generated on server-side and displayed/hidden with jquery if required? or HTML generated on client-side on request?
[18:53:10] <chriys> sup3r: how does it save it. Because basically the end result is to modify a content on page 2 from page 1. I discovered that by using .load() I can load data from a selected div on page to transfer its content into another div on page 2.
[18:54:17] <chriys> So when I go to page 1 I want to enter a text in the input so then what I entered in the input is saved in the html file so the page 2 grabs its content to display it
[18:56:10] <sup3r> chriys: http://pastebin.com/v4Y0cCgU
[18:56:44] <sup3r> data: $("#form").serialize(),,  -->> data: $("#form").serialize(), (one)
[18:56:45] <sup3r> sorry
[18:58:25] <kompressor> chriys you're passing data in-between pages with jQuery?
[18:58:28] <kompressor> yikes...
[18:58:55] <chriys> kompressor: if you have a better solution i'll take it
[18:59:01] <kompressor> PHP...
[18:59:10] <chriys> show me how
[18:59:12] <kompressor> I don't understand "the input is saved in the html file" either
[18:59:13] <kompressor> ...
[18:59:32] <sup3r> ow god
[18:59:33] <sammych1> localStorage?
[18:59:40] <sup3r> chriys http://www.gajotres.net/passing-data-between-jquery-mobile-pages/
[18:59:42] <sup3r> see this
[18:59:59] <sammych1> context is king.
[19:00:43] <sammych1> you don't
[19:01:24] <chriys> guys the only thing I want to do is edit the src link on my media page. So I want to create a page where we enter the link and then it updates the src link on the media page
[19:01:26] <sammych1> you don't 'pass' data between pages. All the pages run in the same browser state. Just put it in a variable somewhere, and read it back onpageshow
[19:09:43] <Prometheian> I'm using Select2 for my dropdown(select) but for some reason it's removing the normal arrow in the element. Anyone happen to encounter this/a fix?
[19:13:08] <sup3r> Prometheian { multiple: true, maximumSelectionSize: 1 }.
[19:13:36] <Prometheian> Sorry for a dumb question, realized I needed the select2.png :/
[19:14:01] <sup3r> ok
[19:14:14] <Prometheian> ty tho!
[19:53:17] <hwamokp66> I'm trying to open a embedded vimeo player with prettyPhoto. The link plays when i go to it but when i open it via prettyPhoto, it doesn't load. any ideas?     <a href="http://player.vimeo.com/video/75347916" rel="prettyPhoto" title=""><img src="images/portfolio/ps.png" width="50%" style="float:left;padding:5px;"></a>
[20:23:40] <krz> how do i remove last element from array
[20:24:31] <BillCris_> krz: .last().remove()
[20:24:41] <BillCris_> Assuming it's a jQuery collection.
[20:26:26] <krz> no it isnt BillCris_
[20:27:32] <BillCris_> You can do arr.pop()
[20:28:14] <krz> ['a','b','c'].pop(); returns 'c'
[20:28:38] <BillCris_> Yeah, but the original array will be ['a', 'b']
[20:29:41] <BillCris_> Do you want a copy of the array without the last item in it?
[20:30:32] <krz> i see
[20:30:42] <krz> yea i guess i could do that
[20:31:22] <BillCris_> var newArray = oldArray.slice(0, oldArray.length - 1);
[20:32:45] <gtristan> I'm doing some crazy loops and DOM manipulation, and just to double check... when I do either $(node).children().each(), or $(node).find('[attr-name]').each()... basically I am first getting a set of references, and then iterating over them with '.each()', correct ? I'm only a little concerned because I will be altering the tree in the 'each' callback
[20:34:24] <BillCris_> gtristan: Yes.
[20:34:36] <gtristan> i.e. the loop will $(child).detach() in some cases, and I rely on the fact that the result of .children() or .find() was collected once in advance, and that .each() will continue to consider nodes which were detached
[20:34:47] <gtristan> BillCris_, alright thanks, just my careful paranoia :)
[20:35:38] <BillCris_> No problem.
[20:42:07] <pilgrimish> sammych1: was that the right direction (re: overriding select menu with widget): http://api.jqueryui.com/selectmenu/
[20:48:52] <pilgrimish> hey all, looking to replace a select menu’s functionality with a ul so i can better style it, jquery seems to be the way to go, but haven’t found anything stable/consisten
[20:55:37] <mAxX--> is there any twitter bootstrap channel?
[20:55:54] <mAxX--> or maybe anyone familiar
[20:57:04] <root3d> mAxX--, there is twitter opensource
[20:57:27] <mAxX--> huh
[21:25:12] <doug64k> pilgrimish: http://www.jstraight.com/1183/2
[21:29:07] <pilgrimish> doug64k: ok
[21:29:08] <pilgrimish> thank you
[21:30:20] <pilgrimish> that definitely makes the switch, tricky thing is, in looking at the way you’ve got active li selected (data-selected), the plugin i’m using doesn’t seem to apply any active state to any of the options, so it just breaks
[21:32:57] <guzzlefry> I'm drawing a blank. What's the jQuery function that applies event handlers to matching elements as they're created?
[21:34:38] <doug64k> guzzlefry: there isn't. you use event delegation on an ancestor of the dynamically added elements
[21:35:35] <doug64k> pilgrimish: you could use the attribute "selected" which might work better in the css, but wouldn't be strictly standards compliant
[21:36:40] <doug64k> guzzlefry: say you are adding a bunch of inputs with class foo dynamically, you might do $(document).on('click', '.foo', function(event) ...
[21:37:15] <doug64k> guzzlefry: or something closer to the elements that is still reachable through parents from every button
[21:37:25] <doug64k> instead of document
[21:38:15] <guzzlefry> ah okay, that's what i tried earlier. Something must be off.
[21:42:39] <guzzlefry> helps if you apply the class to the element you're trying to remove. ;)
[21:43:17] <pilgrimish> doug64k: no dice, will keep diggin
[22:46:15] <fatmandown> anyone around
[22:47:19] <fatmandown> if I do a text = $("<tbody><tr><td>text here</td></tr></tbody>") and then do text.append($("<tr><td>more text</td></tr>"))
[22:47:28] <fatmandown> what element will that get appended to in that first string
[22:49:01] <Uhkis> console.log is your friend
[22:49:12] <fatmandown> bagh
[22:51:06] <fatmandown> Uhkis: thank you
[22:51:16] <fatmandown> I was lazy and wanted an answer immediately
[22:51:26] <fatmandown> but I did it myself and got the answer I needed so thank you
[22:56:00] <Uhkis> teach a man to fish and all that ;-)
[22:56:20] <Woet> hi Uhkis ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[22:56:36] <Uhkis> yo Woet
[23:14:48] <fatmandown> is there a reason a random null value would be inserted into my JSON object
[23:17:47] <root3d> fatmandown, there is only one kind of null value
[23:18:12] <fatmandown> lemme rephrase
[23:18:31] <fatmandown> i don't know why but a null value is being inserted into my json object between the two biggest properties
[23:19:30] <root3d> fatmandown, you may be modify it somewhere, also for debugging : https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks
[23:40:54] <frank_o> Hi! Is it worth looking into ways of doing say `foo ? true : false` without the else?
[23:41:56] <Cork> frank_o: you mean like !!foo ?
[23:42:30] <frank_o> Cork: Not sure, for instance var a = true; var b = false; var c = a ? true : false;
[23:42:46] <Cork> frank_o: what's the point of that?
[23:42:46] <frank_o> The alternatives at stackoverflow.com/questions/2932754/ternary-operators-in-javascript-without-an-else don't look all that attractive
[23:42:52] <Cork> why not just var c = a
[23:43:03] <frank_o> hey!
[23:43:15] <frank_o> i'll be damned Cork, ofcourse why not!
[23:43:20] <Cork> -_-'
[23:43:48] <frank_o> cheers :)
