[03:06:40] <aiya> How does risize adjust the size of multiple elements
[03:07:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[03:10:36] <aiya> I used Ben Alman's resize method, but it can only be used on one element, not on multiple elements
[03:11:19] <robertmaxrees> So you'd like to apply it to multiple elements aiya?
[03:11:51] <aiya> yes
[03:12:02] <robertmaxrees> make a jsfiddle :)
[03:12:22] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, just make your site responsive and use proper CSS ;)
[03:13:22] <undefined_bob> lol true that
[03:15:47] <aiya> However, this risize does not seem to work on echarts
[03:16:17] <robertmaxrees> ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[03:16:20] <robertmaxrees> welp
[03:16:27] <robertmaxrees> guess there are no answers.
[03:16:36] <robertmaxrees> pack it in folks.  it's all broken.
[03:20:45] <aiya> Because my echarts were added through jQuery, and then there need to be multiple echarts on the page. Now only the first resize method is useful, and the others are useless
[03:21:56] <robertmaxrees> I'm peering into my crystal ball and having a really hard time figuring out the problem.  If only there were a way to show us the bug.
[12:29:24] <LittleMerman> Guys im new to jquery, can someone help me how do i display the current value of the timer on this: https://www.npmjs.com/package/countdowntimer
[12:34:21] <LittleMerman> Like when i click a button, i want to display the current value of the timer
[12:36:52] <shoky_> LittleMerman: you can get the .text() of the element with the countdown timer on it. i don't see another way to get it
[12:41:25] <LittleMerman> thanks shoky_
[15:48:24] <anton_229> im using wordpress.
[15:48:55] <robertmaxrees> cool
[15:49:32] <anton_229>   https://bpa.st/4N5Q when I click the links I got 404 and a black windows that when I close it it shows the right img
[15:49:59] <robertmaxrees> Make a jsfiddle :)
[15:50:43] <anton_229> cant just give you the link?
[15:51:03] <robertmaxrees> would prefer an isolated test case but we can take a swing at the actual site i guess.
[15:51:13] <anton_229> just the top part
[15:51:21] <anton_229> i have 3 li
[15:51:31] <anton_229> the second and third works
[15:51:32] <robertmaxrees> please don't PM me.
[15:51:35] <robertmaxrees> just share it to the channel
[15:51:42] <robertmaxrees> if you can't share it to the channel, I don't want it PMed :)
[15:52:00] <anton_229> sure since you are the only one in this channel
[15:52:07] <anton_229> the rest are your bots innit?
[15:52:14] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:52:16] <anton_229> https://www.searchqueryauditor.com/google-ad-keywords-jimmy/36623
[15:52:25] <robertmaxrees> this is a public, logged channel heh.
[15:52:52] <anton_229> test second and third one
[15:53:09] <robertmaxrees> so what's the question?
[15:53:13] <robertmaxrees> why are you getting a 404?
[15:53:28] <anton_229> yes and then why i get the right img
[15:53:34] <anton_229> when i close that black window
[15:53:39] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[15:53:42] <robertmaxrees> one thing at a time :)
[15:53:57] <robertmaxrees> what image should the, say, second link be showing?
[15:54:24] <robertmaxrees> like, actually share the link to the image on your server.
[15:54:57] <anton_229> https://www.searchqueryauditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/img/36623_dentist_dental_implant_seminars_desktop_5ececfe23c6d8e76917c62ae.png
[15:55:29] <anton_229> and for the 3rd one https://www.searchqueryauditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/img/36623_dentist_dental_implant_vacation_desktop_5ececfe9f1c4a57a98ab99cc.png
[15:57:46] <anton_229> should load the img on the right side. does it work at your end?
[15:58:40] <robertmaxrees> i'm very confused about what the bug is.
[15:58:53] <robertmaxrees> are youa sking why the image in the modal isn't working?
[15:59:28] <anton_229> so when you click the link it should replace the img src on the right with the href
[15:59:35] <anton_229> there shouldnt be any modal
[15:59:46] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/nkWIvT1.png
[15:59:50] <robertmaxrees> this is what I see when I click.
[16:00:05] <anton_229> yes me too but when you close it
[16:00:11] <anton_229> it loads the img
[16:00:20] <anton_229> in the right div where it should
[16:00:30] <anton_229> so that black window shouldnt popup
[16:00:52] <robertmaxrees> so you're just asking why that image on the right isn't changing the way you'd expect.
[16:00:53] <anton_229> its just like an slider
[16:01:06] <anton_229> yes
[16:01:11] <robertmaxrees> look at the element.
[16:01:13] <robertmaxrees> srcset
[16:01:33] <robertmaxrees> gotta modify/remove that.
[16:02:05] <anton_229> where? in the jquery part?
[16:02:17] <robertmaxrees> from the page source.
[16:02:23] <robertmaxrees> or via jquery.  depending.
[16:02:33] <robertmaxrees> if you want to remove it, then edit the page source to remove it.
[16:02:42] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, properly set it dynamically using jquery.
[16:03:03] <anton_229> thats what my jquery code is suppose to do
[16:03:09] <anton_229> which line are you refering to?
[16:03:31] <robertmaxrees> notice how that image element has a srcset attribute?
[16:03:37] <anton_229> yes
[16:03:41] <anton_229> and this
[16:03:43] <anton_229>  $(".elementor-image img").attr('src', image_path);
[16:03:44] <robertmaxrees> that's your issue.
[16:03:45] <anton_229> should shange it
[16:03:47] <robertmaxrees> again
[16:03:49] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:03:52] <robertmaxrees> that's changing the src.
[16:03:54] <robertmaxrees> not the srcset
[16:03:59] <robertmaxrees> separate attribute.
[16:04:26] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images for more info
[16:05:09] <anton_229> oh you mean the alt srcset
[16:05:14] <anton_229> yes i found it
[16:05:17] <robertmaxrees> not "alt"
[16:05:21] <robertmaxrees> it's just the srcset :)
[16:05:33] <robertmaxrees> the alt attribute is separate.
[16:05:36] <anton_229> so similiar to this? $(".elementor-image img").attr('srcset', image_path);
[16:05:42] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:05:54] <robertmaxrees> read the page about srcset and understand what it's doing, then go from there.
[16:06:04] <anton_229> that img was created with elementro
[16:06:06] <anton_229> elementor
[16:06:13] <anton_229> so probably could delete there
[16:06:20] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't.
[16:06:25] <anton_229> ok let me check
[16:06:36] <robertmaxrees> that allows you to have responsive images.
[16:06:41] <robertmaxrees> so properly use it :)
[16:08:09] <anton_229> ok so i can remove it first
[16:08:16] <anton_229> as you were saying
[16:08:18] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea.
[16:08:19] <anton_229> before my code
[16:08:25] <robertmaxrees> responsive images are a good thing to use.
[16:08:26] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:11:08] <anton_229> var $srcset = $(this).attr('data-full-srcset'); $('.elementor-img img').attr('srcset', $srcset);
[16:11:17] <anton_229> but what is data-full-srcset?
[16:11:22] <anton_229> same path to pic?
[16:11:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:11:44] <robertmaxrees> where did data-full-srcset come from?
[16:11:52] <anton_229> from a sample i found
[16:12:03] <robertmaxrees> uh
[16:12:13] <anton_229> what is that value? the path to the pic?
[16:12:15] <robertmaxrees> do you see a data-full-srcset in your current page?
[16:12:20] <robertmaxrees> because it's not there.
[16:12:32] <robertmaxrees> in fact, that entire line doesn't make sense lol.
[16:12:40] <robertmaxrees> did you read the page I sent about responsive images?
[16:13:09] <anton_229> its basically the same img path
[16:13:13] <anton_229> with diferent width values
[16:13:18] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[16:13:22] <robertmaxrees> so what does that tell you?
[16:13:39] <anton_229> to replace my img path with those values
[16:13:51] <anton_229> maybe in a loop or something
[16:14:10] <robertmaxrees> you need to generate those different sized images, store them on your server, and then update both the src and srcset attributes as necessary.
[16:14:18] <robertmaxrees> probably won't need a loop.
[16:15:26] <anton_229> too complex
[16:15:36] <anton_229> cant you just do it with css?
[16:15:46] <robertmaxrees> do what with CSS?
[16:15:50] <robertmaxrees> so attributes?
[16:15:54] <robertmaxrees> *set attributes?
[16:16:05] <anton_229> the responsivenes
[16:16:22] <robertmaxrees> that's for responsive layouts.  you didn't read the link i sent.
[16:16:49] <robertmaxrees> backing way up - why are you using a plugin to replace that image in the first place?  that's a very easy thing to do without any plugins.
[16:17:16] <anton_229> there is a guy who is designing this page but doesnt know any programming
[16:17:30] <anton_229> so asked me to add those li dynamically
[16:17:33] <anton_229> from a db
[16:17:44] <anton_229> he initially did it in rev slider
[16:18:01] <anton_229> but i cant figure it out how to make that slider dinamically
[16:18:37] <anton_229> his version is this one https://www.searchqueryauditor.com/google-ad-keywords
[16:18:44] <robertmaxrees> that's not really using a slider :shrug:
[16:18:58] <anton_229> it is the last one i gave you
[16:19:01] <robertmaxrees> you just want to replace the image src and srcset
[16:19:25] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.
[16:19:31] <robertmaxrees> the way you're doing this now won't work with that.
[16:19:49] <anton_229> yeah i know
[16:19:59] <anton_229> thats why im using a shortcode in elementor
[16:20:04] <anton_229> using php code plugin
[16:20:12] <anton_229> its called xyz
[16:20:18] <robertmaxrees> like - yhou shouldn't be touching any jquery for this.
[16:20:24] <robertmaxrees> *you
[16:20:45] <anton_229> how would you make it dinamycally in elementor or rev slider then?
[16:20:59] <robertmaxrees> you need to generate the proper markup.
[16:20:59] <anton_229> his version is just static
[16:21:16] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you need to generate it all server-side instead.
[16:21:19] <robertmaxrees> not client-side.
[16:21:31] <anton_229> how?
[16:21:45] <robertmaxrees> by using PHP...??
[16:21:57] <anton_229> im using it
[16:22:08] <robertmaxrees> right, so use it to generate the markup the plugin is expecting.
[16:22:33] <anton_229> by markup you mean to add the tags and with their classes?
[16:22:47] <robertmaxrees> the html that ends up on the page.
[16:23:05] <robertmaxrees> basically, replicate the HTML you get in the version that works.
[16:23:21] <anton_229> but thats generated automatically
[16:23:29] <anton_229> arent the ids random?
[16:23:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:24:14] <anton_229> its a lot of code
[16:24:20] <anton_229> autogenerated code
[16:24:24] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:24:35] <robertmaxrees> you need to replicate the html that revolution slider is using.
[16:24:47] <anton_229> so you mean like <rs-layer-wrap class="rs-parallax-wrap" ------
[16:25:00] <anton_229> create all those divs and styles in php?
[16:25:34] <robertmaxrees> rs-module-wrap and its children, yeah.  or just read the docs.
[16:25:38] <robertmaxrees> or use another plugin.
[16:26:46] <robertmaxrees> if there's no api or instructions on how to customize it the way you'd like, i'd change your approach and use a different plugin.
[16:27:09] <anton_229> let me try it by copy pasting it but probably
[16:27:18] <anton_229> its too hasle
[16:27:28] <anton_229> can i just replicate it with jquery?
[16:27:29] <robertmaxrees> i mean.
[16:27:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:27:38] <anton_229> doestn have to be that smooth
[16:27:58] <robertmaxrees> "hey so you may have to do some manual work to get this functional"
[16:28:13] <robertmaxrees> "too much effort.  what if i wrote my own version?"
[16:28:18] <robertmaxrees> see the issue there? ;)
[16:28:46] <anton_229> i will try to copy paste the divs where it belongs and put the variables inside it
[16:28:48] <anton_229> but let me ask you this
[16:28:59] <anton_229> when you say i have to create the different pics
[16:29:03] <anton_229> for different sizes
[16:29:11] <anton_229> you mean i have to have different phisical versions
[16:29:12] <anton_229> of it?
[16:29:24] <robertmaxrees> different copies of it server-side, yes.
[16:29:25] <anton_229> with different sizes and resolutions?
[16:29:39] <robertmaxrees> if you read the link i sent about responsive images, you'd see why :)
[16:30:15] <anton_229> does the rev slider version use that as well?
[16:30:36] <anton_229> i dont see that image has different sizes
[16:30:37] <robertmaxrees> how do you think you could check that for yourself?
[17:09:54] <anton_229> robertmaxrees I was testing with just replacing the srcset with the same path but the popup still appears
[17:10:38] <robertmaxrees> you mean the image modal thing?
[17:10:56] <anton_229> yes
[17:11:03] <anton_229> still poping up
[17:11:06] <anton_229> still 404
[17:11:22] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: dunno duder.
[17:11:33] <robertmaxrees> soounds like you're using a plugin you shouldn't be using.
[17:11:53] <anton_229> what plugin you recomend?
[17:12:02] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:12:04] <robertmaxrees> for what?
[17:12:14] <anton_229> what pluging are you refering to?
[17:12:34] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:12:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:12:37] <anton_229> do you think its because the xyzinsertphp code?
[17:12:42] <robertmaxrees> you're confusing me a ton.
[17:12:56] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to turn that modal off?
[17:13:01] <anton_229> yes
[17:13:08] <anton_229> it should just replace the img
[17:13:15] <anton_229> not popups
[17:13:18] <anton_229> no modals
[17:14:32] <anton_229> is it missing the propagation?
[17:14:51] <robertmaxrees> wtf does propagation have to do with this???
[17:14:59] <anton_229> i mean e.preventDefault();
[17:15:05] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with this.
[17:15:34] <anton_229> could it be because adblock?
[17:15:38] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[17:15:39] <robertmaxrees> chill.
[17:15:45] <robertmaxrees> do you need the carousel effects?  or you just want to switch out the image?
[17:16:25] <anton_229> if you can add a carousel would be owesome
[17:16:31] <anton_229> nothing fancy
[17:16:40] <robertmaxrees> then go search google :)
[17:16:42] <robertmaxrees> tons of options.
[17:16:46] <anton_229> haha
[17:16:53] <anton_229> then just change image
[17:16:59] <anton_229> i will research it later
[17:17:02] <robertmaxrees> don't need a plugin for that.
[17:17:11] <robertmaxrees> literally just replacing the image source.
[17:17:24] <anton_229> yes thats what my code does it right
[17:17:29] <anton_229> so what that popup crap
[17:17:30] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[17:17:33] <robertmaxrees> i dunno.
[17:17:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:17:39] <robertmaxrees> i didn't build your site.
[17:17:41] <robertmaxrees> probably a plugin.
[17:17:51] <anton_229> you mean a wordpress plugin?
[17:18:02] <anton_229> is there a way to just add php without using a plugin?
[17:18:04] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: dunno.
[17:18:09] <robertmaxrees> i don't use wordpress.
[17:18:58] <anton_229> its weird
[17:19:02] <anton_229> that i get 404
[17:19:05] <anton_229> but then finds it
[17:19:15] <anton_229> its like an automatic redirection
[17:20:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:20:05] <robertmaxrees> "but then finds it"? it 404s.
[17:20:24] <anton_229> yes but when you close the modal
[17:20:27] <anton_229> it loads it
[17:20:33] <anton_229> it loads the correct img
[17:20:36] <robertmaxrees> link again?
[17:20:52] <robertmaxrees> the modal was using a completely separate URL for the image.
[17:20:59] <anton_229> https://www.searchqueryauditor.com/google-ad-keywords-jimmy/36623/
[17:21:01] <robertmaxrees> so the plguin is probably the issue.
[17:21:02] <robertmaxrees> and wait
[17:21:12] <robertmaxrees> i thought you wanted to get rid of that modal?
[17:21:19] <anton_229> yes i want
[17:21:34] <robertmaxrees> then why are you trying to troublshoot it???
[17:21:50] <anton_229> im just seeing the console
[17:21:58] <anton_229> network console
[17:21:59] <anton_229> shows 404
[17:22:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:22:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[17:22:09] <robertmaxrees> because it's loading a bad URL.
[17:22:11] <robertmaxrees> for the modal;.
[17:22:12] <robertmaxrees> *modal
[17:26:14] <noudle> maybe wrong channel, but anyways: when a html tag attribute has a url, and that url starts with a '#', how is that interpreted? is it appened to the current url? or is it appended to scheme://host/ ?
[17:27:10] <robertmaxrees> it's a page hash - it appends it to the end of the current page's URL/replaces any existing hash.
[17:27:25] <robertmaxrees> and scrolls the page to the element with that ID :)
[17:27:48] <robertmaxrees> also: asking the same question in multiple channels at the same time is a no-no.
[17:27:52] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:27:55] <noudle> hehe :)
[17:27:57] <noudle> ik
[17:28:17] <noudle> im tired and did not want to wait
[17:28:19] <noudle> sorry
[17:28:28] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[17:28:30] <robertmaxrees> not cool duder.
[17:29:10] <noudle> :(
[17:37:12] <anton_229> robertmaxrees i think propagation has something to do with it. I added it and now it wont show the modal initially only after it changed the img. Could you check it
[17:39:17] <robertmaxrees> lmfao
[17:39:17] <robertmaxrees> dude
[17:39:19] <robertmaxrees> remove the plugin.
[17:39:25] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're just monkey-patching it.
[17:39:34] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what event propagation even is?
[17:40:17] <anton_229> robertmaxrees what plugin?
[17:40:24] <robertmaxrees> the plugin generating the modal.
[17:40:40] <anton_229> how would i know which plugin is ?
[17:40:59] <robertmaxrees> research which plugins are installed and see if it's one of those.
[17:54:25] <anton_229> robertmaxrees I fixed it
[17:54:47] <robertmaxrees> go on
[17:55:06] <anton_229> robertmaxrees ok i will search for carousell now
[17:55:12] <robertmaxrees> ???
[17:55:15] <robertmaxrees> how'd you fix it? lol
[17:55:30] <anton_229> robertmaxrees using the propagation as i told y ou
[17:55:36] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea :shrug:
[17:55:40] <anton_229> robertmaxrees its weird that y ou  didnt now that
[17:55:47] <robertmaxrees> adding the caoursel plugin is going to make it even worse.
[17:55:55] <anton_229> not plugin
[17:56:00] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what event propagation even is?
[17:56:01] <anton_229> animation with jquery
[17:56:14] <anton_229> robertmaxrees no but it works
[17:56:17] <anton_229> you can try it
[17:56:25] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[17:56:27] <anton_229> e.preventdault
[17:56:34] <anton_229> and then stoppropagation
[17:56:39] <anton_229> whats wrong with it
[17:56:42] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[17:56:44] <anton_229> works like a charm
[17:56:51] <robertmaxrees> inb4 weird bugs with the carouself setup.,
[17:56:52] <robertmaxrees> enjoy :)
[20:14:23] <anton299> i want to grab the href from the first li
[20:14:26] <anton299> var first_link= $( "li" ).first().a  ?
[20:15:03] <robertmaxrees> you want .find()
[20:15:35] <anton299> var url = $("ul a:first").attr("href"); ?
[20:15:50] <robertmaxrees> you want .find()
[20:16:07] <robertmaxrees> why would you ask a question, ignore the answer, and then ask another slightly related question?
[20:16:34] <anton299> var href = $('ul').find('a').attr('href'); ?
[20:16:53] <anton299> but by default finds the first one?
[20:16:54] <robertmaxrees> $('ul li').first().find('a')
[20:17:08] <anton299> ok let me try
[20:17:15] <robertmaxrees> you should give https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/ a run-through.
[20:17:21] <robertmaxrees> gives you a solid grasp of the basics.
[20:17:34] <anton299> i will pay a lynda course
[20:17:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:17:45] <anton299> 20 dollars per month is not too much
[20:18:04] <robertmaxrees> plenty of free resources available but whatever works :)
[20:18:12] <anton299> you mean like udemy?
[20:18:16] <anton299> or youtube?
[20:18:22] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[20:18:41] <robertmaxrees> the site built by the people that made the library :)
[20:36:17] <anton299> robertmaxrees what i wanna do now is to initialize the picture with the first href  in the ul when  page is loaded. My question is in which event should i I put it?
[20:36:29] <robertmaxrees> document ready.
[20:36:31] <anton299> could it be $( ".elementor-image" ).load(function() {
[20:36:37] <robertmaxrees> that won't work.
[20:36:44] <anton299> oh so document ready
[20:36:51] <anton299> is the same as jquery (funtion) innit?
[20:37:08] <anton299> so should i just add it here?                   jQuery(function ($)  {
[20:37:24] <anton299> or inside of it i have to put document.ready?
[20:37:34] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery3
[20:37:57] <robertmaxrees> yes, it is a shortcut for document ready.
