[01:29:52] <pepeevich> Hello. How to add styles to jquery object that is located inside other jquery object? (In: 2 jquery object, where 1 inside 2 Out: stylization of 2 jquery object).
[01:30:36] <pepeevich> One more requirement - good perfomance.
[01:56:49] <bambanxx> Any help here? http://codepen.io/bambanx/pen/BKeaOj   am trying the carousel act as independent, but not sure how i can do with a optimized code.

[02:32:54] <tedmed> hey, im lost here, if im returning a multidimensional array with an unknown depth and i want to access the values based on dynamic keys how do i do that? For example the JSON object json[lvl1][lvl2][lvl3][lvl4] = variable. now i want do do var keyref = [lvl1][lvl2][lvl3][lvl4] and do json[keyref]. That ofcourse doesnt work, but maybe you get the point?
[02:33:35] <tedmed> i do not wish to loop, because i need to be able to access a specific value instantly when one of the keys changes for example when a user selects another value in a drop down
[03:04:47] <tedmed> Basically like this:
[03:04:47] <tedmed> https://jsfiddle.net/ohs6nvqh/4/
[03:05:02] <tedmed> but is there a better more efficient way to this without the loop?
[03:30:21] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> hey guys, is there a way to have accept in droppable work with something like .not? like accept if the element doesnt have a certain class?
[03:31:14] <rollingWolf> UnfixedSNIPERJ, .element:not(.anotherelement)
[03:41:30] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> rollingWolf, I have tried that, I use .selectable:not(.ui-selected) but ui-selected is added via selectable
[03:41:48] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> and i dont think droppable recognizes that the class was applied for some reason
[03:44:06] <rollingWolf> UnfixedSNIPERJ, What about $(document).find('.selectable:not(.whatever)') then?
[03:45:06] <rollingWolf> Not really that sure about jquery-ui havent used it in some time :S
[03:49:25] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> yeah, it works the first time I select something, but if I unselect and try it again it doesnt reset for some reason
[03:49:31] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> been the issue of the day lol
[03:50:03] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> https://jsfiddle.net/UnfixedSNIPERJ/3gggh6bg/15/  droppable doesnt even work in that example but it shows how everything is structured
[03:50:08] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> probably going to sleep on this one
[04:51:35] <harry1> morning people... I have a simple question. A present a form to a user, the choices build a div wihich contains text labels. The user can add further divs with these labels by clicking an add button
[04:51:36] <harry1> https://jsfiddle.net/xwh58z9e/
[04:52:01] <harry1> The problem is that when I target the last div to add the content too it clears the other divs
[04:52:11] <harry1> although the content is correctly added to the last div
[04:59:10] <AdamPDotty> Maybe you should start by including jquery.
[04:59:49] <AdamPDotty> Then the code does nothing unexpected.
[06:17:53] <daslicht> anyone knows a carousel / slideshow plugin which offers linear marqee like animation

[07:46:22] <sp1rs> Hi
[07:46:42] <sp1rs> Is it possible to post request and then submit form in jquery ?
[07:47:59] <Cork> sp1rs: request? not really
[07:48:13] <sp1rs> Cork: post request
[07:48:14] <Cork> you would have to use an iframe if you want to load a form
[07:48:37] <Cork> sp1rs: what is the difference between posting a request and submitting a form?
[07:48:53] <Cork> or rather what do you thing is the difference
[07:49:26] <sp1rs> Cork: so the problem is when i submit the form , i need to do some post request (some calcuation ) and then submit the form
[07:49:59] <Cork> so what you mean is you want to make an ajax call and when that call is done submit the form?
[07:50:14] <Cork> (as what you say doesn't make sense)
[07:50:37] <sp1rs> Cork: yes
[07:50:54] <Cork> sp1rs: well you can but i would strongly recommend NOT do to that
[07:50:58] <Cork> *to do
[07:51:13] <sp1rs> Cork: what is the other alternative ?
[07:51:18] <Duikb00t> You can maybe use a Worker?
[07:51:26] <Duikb00t> For the calculation?
[07:51:42] <Cork> sp1rs: why not just make the calculation in the server that takes the post?
[07:51:58] <Cork> why first post, wait parse response and then post again?
[07:52:02] <Duikb00t> Even better ^
[07:55:11] <sp1rs> http://pastebin.com/FUDzH7N5
[07:55:14] <sp1rs> my code ..
[07:55:22] <sp1rs> not working
[10:17:10] <pepeevich> How to get dimensions of hidden block? I need calculate some things before my element will be rendered by browser.
[10:19:46] <AdamPDotty> .width ?
[10:20:02] <AdamPDotty> .width() ?
[10:22:12] <decx> no
[10:22:44] <decx> impossible without adding it
[10:26:10] <cannap> visiblity:hidden
[10:26:43] <AdamPDotty> yeah, he said it's hidden
[10:26:54] <decx> well hidden has width and height
[10:26:57] <decx> only displaY: none doesnt
[10:27:00] <cannap> yes
[10:27:18] <decx> or an element not yet added to the dom
[10:27:23] <decx> from createElement()
[10:27:25] <cannap> or just show grab height and width and hidden again
[10:27:40] <decx> na, position aboslute and visibility hidden is fine
[10:27:45] <cannap> but i dont know what is your goal
[10:28:14] <palli> Hi
[10:28:29] <pepeevich> oh, thanks
[10:28:32] <palli> I am new to jquery moving from css to javascript
[10:28:58] <palli> I am unable to invoke click function onto the button
[10:29:04] <palli> here's the JS
[10:29:05] <palli> http://pastebin.com/HtDRTPW4
[10:29:14] <palli> Can anyone please help mem insolving this issue
[10:29:42] <palli> $('.avatarList').on('click', '.avatarList', function (){   $(this).toggleClass('expand');   $('#divCircle').toggleClass('expand'); });  $('#divCircle img').click(function() {   var theSrc = $(this).attr('src');  // alert(theSrc);   $('.mainImg img').attr('src', theSrc); });
[10:29:56] <AdamPDotty> Ã¤hem
[10:30:13] <AdamPDotty> Where/When do you want do invoke?
[10:30:50] <palli> When I click a image which is right now with a class called avatar list
[10:31:07] <palli> http://codepen.io/frazerwilson/pen/qEdQzq

[10:31:14] <b-ot> (donguston) â@UKIP (UKIP): The #MirrorLiveEU debate starts at 15.30 - tune in and Tweet along in support of @Nigel_Farage and the Leave side https://t.co/Ty1x36QirP (6 minutes and 53 seconds ago)
[10:31:15] <AdamPDotty> So you want to handle the click, not invoke it?
[10:31:17] <palli> This is the exact example I am trying to implement
[10:31:31] <palli> But its working on codepn but on my local
[10:33:04] <AdamPDotty> well you do not want the second parameter in this .on()-function
[10:33:10] <AdamPDotty> not in this case
[10:34:23] <AdamPDotty> (performancewise you really should work with more variables)
[10:35:14] <palli> You mean i should use different function ?
[10:35:46] <palli> $('.avatarList').click(function() {   $(this).toggleClass('expand');   $('#divCircle').toggleClass('expand'); });  $('#divCircle img').click(function() {   var theSrc = $(this).attr('src');  // alert(theSrc);   $('.mainImg img').attr('src', theSrc); });
[10:35:58] <palli> I tried this, even then unable towork with it
[10:36:03] <AdamPDotty> not at all, same function other version. Just drop the second parameter '.avatarList'
[10:36:49] <AdamPDotty> It would be easier to help with a jsfiddle
[10:40:38] <_TWG_> Has anyone here worked with UIKit before?
[10:41:19] <_TWG_> I'm trying to hide the offcanvas sidebar after I click on a link to add a marker to my map.

[11:45:39] <Okweye>             $grid.find('.ui-jqgrid-labels > th:eq(' + (pos) + ')').css('width', columns[pos].width);
[11:47:11] <Okweye> columns[pos].width  is equal to 34 when the original size was 200.
[12:10:12] <z1haze> hey I have a question about what code takes precedence over an another. Is it the first code, or the last code that runs
[12:10:47] <taplar> huh?
[12:11:38] <z1haze> I have a website that is served in many languages, and some of them have different functionalities, such as email subscription forms. I need to prevent the default action of a form and do my own thing on a certain site, so the way i have to do it is on this specific site, insert my small js file either before or after my app.js
[12:11:53] <z1haze> im wondering where i need to insert my code to override whatever it was doing before
[12:12:17] <taplar> unless something async is going on, logic processes from top to bottom
[12:12:20] <z1haze> Basically, originally the code his the server, does some validtion, etc.. but for this chinese site i have to do things different so i want to cancel all that
[12:12:38] <taplar> so you'd need your logic to run after theirs
[12:12:42] <z1haze> so id put my code up top then?
[12:12:52] <taplar> after theirs
[12:13:09] <z1haze> how can preventDefault() run after their code and prevent it?
[12:13:29] <z1haze> basically they have code that does like $(form).submit() whatever.. i needto stop that
[12:13:40] <taplar> you'd bind to the same things they are, and then you'd prevent it or stop propagation so their event processing never happens
[12:13:44] <z1haze> and e.preventDefault() doesnt do anything
[12:13:54] <z1haze> even if its after?
[12:14:01] <taplar> it would have to be after
[12:14:20] <taplar> someone may correct me, but iirc the last binding happens first
[12:14:42] <taplar> you could test that though
[12:15:01] <z1haze> so if i have a block of code that says $('body').click(function() { alert('click') then later on i have the samebody click event and i do preventdefault it will stop it?
[12:15:26] <z1haze> oh i justthought, default isnt what i need to stop, is it?
[12:15:37] <taplar> i believe that would stop it
[12:15:57] <taplar> though depending you may also need stopPropagation
[12:15:58] <z1haze> even if thats not the default behavior of submitting a form? because they are both async
[12:16:13] <taplar> what do you mean?
[12:16:37] <taplar> submitting a form isn't async
[12:17:04] <z1haze> well the call is ajax
[12:17:18] <taplar> right, but at the point that the event happens that would lead to that ajax call, it is not
[12:17:24] <z1haze> and honestly im not really sure how it all gets handled, its all demandware stuff
[12:17:40] <z1haze> but preventDefault() that isnt gonna stop the ajax call, right?
[12:17:59] <taplar> look at the docs for preventDefault() and stopPropagation()
[12:18:14] <taplar> one stops bubbling up the chain, the other stops processing by other handlers for the same element, iirc
[12:18:54] <arc_> i thought preventDefault does just what it says. it prevents the behavior that would exist without any javascript event handlers
[12:19:11] <taplar> there's some small difference between the two
[12:19:19] <robertmaxrees> not small.
[12:19:19] <robertmaxrees> big.
[12:19:23] <taplar> return false does both of those effects, iirc
[12:19:53] <arc_> stopPropagation does prevent bubbling as you said
[12:20:00] <robertmaxrees> stopPropagation() just stops the event from bubbling.  default behavior still runs.
[12:20:22] <taplar> ok, so he's really just after preventDefault
[12:20:40] <robertmaxrees> preventDefault() only stops whatever default action would normally happen.
[12:21:20] <arc_> it seems like having preventDefault on body is generally not what you would want. unless you're developing a game or something where all of the default behavior is being overridden
[12:21:40] <taplar> it'd be a smell of binding practices, personally
[12:22:36] <z1haze> body was just an example
[12:22:41] <z1haze> its not on body
[12:22:43] <arc_> now that i'm reading what he's saying, he wants to prevent some javascript from running. preventDefault is not going to do that
[12:23:31] <arc_> if you want to prevent some event from firing, and the event was done in jquery, you can use .off() to remove it and then create your own
[12:24:29] <taplar_lunch> true, provided it wouldn't wipe out desired logic too
[12:24:40] <arc_> well he can just copy it i guess
[12:24:49] <robertmaxrees> you could, but I tend to suggest people not use .off()
[12:25:36] <arc_> it's kind of a weird situation, having to prevent some logic from running when you have no control over the source
[12:25:52] <robertmaxrees> What's the particular logic?
[12:25:54] <robertmaxrees> i was late to the party.
[12:26:04] <arc_> idk, i think he was giving placeholder examples
[12:26:47] <arc_> z1haze?
[12:27:52] <z1haze> its not that i dont have any control
[12:27:53] <z1haze> these are massive sites
[12:28:09] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:28:20] <robertmaxrees> so you just don't want to change the original code?
[12:28:26] <z1haze> they are served in many different countries and cant just modify code that is being used on 9/10 of the sites
[12:28:33] <arc_> okay
[12:28:43] <robertmaxrees> but do you need to change all of those sites anyway?
[12:28:49] <z1haze> no
[12:29:04] <robertmaxrees> so you don't have site specific files for overrides/extra stuff?
[12:29:09] <z1haze> all of the other sites that handle email signups etc use the same service, except this chinese site
[12:29:24] <z1haze> most inherit a kinda global set of files
[12:29:38] <z1haze> its demandware, if you dont use it you cant really understand
[12:30:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah what would i know about running multiple ecommerce sites out of one codebase.
[12:31:08] <z1haze> i didnt say you didnt
[12:31:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:31:13] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:31:17] <z1haze> i said if you dont know demandware you wouldnt understand
[12:31:47] <z1haze> seems you take what yo uwant from the things i say
[12:32:05] <robertmaxrees> you could override that functionality for just that one site by modifying the original JS to check the URL if you really had to.
[12:33:25] <z1haze> then the code would be on every site
[12:33:25] <z1haze> they dont want that
[12:33:57] <robertmaxrees> Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯ you're the dev.  i'd tell 'em "too bad - this is what you get"
[12:34:11] <robertmaxrees> or do the short term fix and then add a long term fix.
[12:34:24] <decx> what's the difference in the things you do
[12:34:27] <decx> just another post url
[12:34:32] <decx> or what
[12:34:47] <z1haze> im one of many, and i just started
[12:34:52] <z1haze> its kind stpuid actually, its a lot different
[12:34:59] <decx> is the old event jquery?
[12:35:05] <z1haze> the company taking the data wants all these extra fields
[12:35:05] <z1haze> nope
[12:35:11] <z1haze> its all done through demandscript
[12:35:12] <decx> well then off won't do
[12:35:30] <robertmaxrees> fbux says demandscript cross-compiles to javascript.
[12:35:39] <decx> an you need a reference to a function to use removeEventListener
[12:35:43] <taplar_lunch> so it's like coffeescript?
[12:35:55] <z1haze> this is what the vendor provided to send https://gyazo.com/4bb81a2c09cb4fc2a86618143bae3da8 its goofy
[12:36:06] <z1haze> 3 fields for each actual field being sent
[12:36:24] <z1haze> its completely proprietary crap but yea its javascript
[12:36:52] <z1haze> its this weird system our 'backend' is like a middleman between the actual system and the front end
[12:37:12] <z1haze> its all built on a java server
[12:42:48] <fuchstronaut> I am working on a drag and drop tool for file uploads and the drop events originalEvent objects dataTransfer is always null
[12:42:59] <fuchstronaut> is this supposed to work with jQuery?
[12:43:22] <robertmaxrees> could you show us what you're trying to do?
[12:47:49] <fuchstronaut> seems like firefox is the problem
[12:48:33] <taplar_lunch> never trust a fox, they're conniving
[12:48:38] <taplar_lunch> and what do they even say?
[12:51:11] <fuchstronaut> the drop event i.e. has a property "dataTransfer" that is NULL in firefox
[12:51:41] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer
[12:53:24] <fuchstronaut> robertmaxrees: i can't access it
[12:53:38] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it.
[12:53:41] <robertmaxrees> wonder why,
[12:54:42] <fuchstronaut> http://pastebin.com/rH6vpVXt
[12:54:53] <fuchstronaut> this is really all that there is
[12:55:08] <fuchstronaut> the events fire, but the dataTransfer property is NULL in firefox
[12:55:23] <robertmaxrees> i'm not saying i don't believe you.
[12:55:29] <robertmaxrees> just curious to figure out why
[12:56:12] <fuchstronaut> I'd be thankful if you help me out
[12:56:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:57:01] <robertmaxrees> mind setting up a fiddle?
[12:57:34] <fuchstronaut> ok, give me two minutes
[12:59:52] * taplar_lunch is making insurance peeps fight for his h.o. policy
[13:01:08] <Uhkis> isn't that some miniature train thing? :D
[13:01:15] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:01:42] <taplar_lunch> dude it's crazy
[13:01:50] <taplar_lunch> i dunno if my current car policy is just crap or what
[13:02:00] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[13:02:12] <taplar_lunch> but one place quoted me for a reduction that would cover my h.o. policy and i'd have like $200 more in my pocket each month
[13:02:20] <fuchstronaut> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/6a62tepg/
[13:02:50] <robertmaxrees> taplar_lunch part of that is that being a homeowner makes you less likely to get in an accident iirc.
[13:03:03] <taplar_lunch> huh
[13:03:12] <robertmaxrees> statistics.
[13:03:20] <robertmaxrees> not causative - correlative.
[13:03:51] <robertmaxrees> and insurance is a statistics game
[13:04:44] <taplar_lunch> so in that sense, the whole 'bundling' to save money is just to help them draw that relationship
[13:05:09] <robertmaxrees> in some cases, yeah.
[13:06:28] <taplar_lunch> huh, didn't know you could give on() an object like that
[13:06:48] <robertmaxrees> yeah. something you should really avoid imo.
[13:06:49] <robertmaxrees> but yeah.
[13:07:02] <fuchstronaut> why should I avoid?
[13:07:15] <robertmaxrees> it's a weird syntax.
[13:07:29] <fuchstronaut> ok, it turns out, that you CAN access the DataTransfer object, it is in some kind of weird portected mode (weird = i didnt know that thing)=
[13:07:41] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:07:43] <fuchstronaut> so the property is displayed as NULL in firebug
[13:07:44] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[13:07:55] <robertmaxrees> are you able to access properties on it?
[13:08:10] <fuchstronaut> firebug shows event.dataTransfer = NULL; but I can console.log it
[13:08:12] <Dro> any idea why the .show() jquery is not working here: http://jsbin.com/nabovitato/1/edit?html,js,output ?
[13:08:34] <robertmaxrees> Dro you want #roles
[13:08:36] <fuchstronaut> btw i think passing an object to jQuery.on() is way easier to read if you have multiple events
[13:08:41] <robertmaxrees> it's an ID not a class.
[13:09:02] <robertmaxrees> fuchstronaut eh, i'd disagree, but not for the reason you'd think :)
[13:09:45] <fuchstronaut> tell me your reason
[13:09:49] <taplar_lunch> imo, feels like your shoving a lot of stuff into one thing
[13:10:25] <taplar_lunch> kinda like you 'can' chain forever, but probably not the best idea
[13:10:28] <robertmaxrees> ^ this, but you also shouldn't be binding directly to elements generally anyway.  use backbone or something.
[13:10:30] <fuchstronaut> because it is, but i prefer to shove a lot for stuff into one thing instead of shoving it one by one
[13:11:11] <fuchstronaut> especially in a case where these two events are related
[13:11:27] <fuchstronaut> dragover is not really used, it is just what you have to do to prevent the browser from opening the files
[13:11:54] <robertmaxrees> also, other people generally won't know wtf they're looking at on first glance.
[13:12:25] <Dro> robertmaxrees, fuchstronaut thx!
[13:12:56] <z1haze> does find() an array if more than one element or just the first one?
[13:13:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:13:12] <taplar_lunch> which fine?
[13:13:14] <z1haze> how would i each() through all clases of .error inside of $(this)
[13:13:15] <taplar_lunch> find()
[13:13:22] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:13:36] <robertmaxrees> z1haze you want all descendents of this with .error?
[13:13:42] <z1haze> remove all elements with class error inside of $(this)
[13:13:54] <robertmaxrees> .find('.error').remove()
[13:14:10] <z1haze> yea but thats gonna be global isnt it
[13:14:14] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:14:21] <robertmaxrees> the $(this) was implied, yo.
[13:14:24] <z1haze> how do i limit it only inside this
[13:14:36] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find('.error').remove();
[13:14:39] <z1haze> forreal?
[13:14:53] <z1haze> ok ok
[13:15:06] <z1haze> thats what i thoguht but i thought it was only removing the first one
[13:15:38] <robertmaxrees> that'll remove all descendents of $(this) with that class.
[13:15:55] <taplar_lunch> most jquery function when operating on a stack will apply it to all of them
[13:16:12] <taplar_lunch> no need to loop yourself
[13:16:37] <robertmaxrees> "the each is implied"
[13:50:58] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> I know I'm doing something stupid simple wrong... But I can't figure it out...
[13:51:04] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> !pastebin
[13:51:09] <robertmaxrees> use jsfiddle :)
[13:51:18] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> jsfiddle won't help for this.
[13:51:22] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:51:51] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> I have a function that does an api request and I can't get the function to return a simple true/false from the api request.
[13:52:03] <robertmaxrees> because you can't.
[13:52:04] <robertmaxrees> :)(
[13:52:06] <robertmaxrees> * :)
[13:52:09] <robertmaxrees> it's ajax.
[13:52:15] <robertmaxrees> you can't return out of ajax calls like that.
[13:52:41] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> I can't pass a true false back as a result of an ajax request?
[13:52:45] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:52:47] <robertmaxrees> it's async.
[13:52:53] <taplar> what does true/false mean in the given case?
[13:53:03] <robertmaxrees> the entire page would have to lock up waiting for the ajax call to finish.
[13:53:09] <robertmaxrees> you need to pass a callback instead.
[13:54:17] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> basically... $.get( { ... } ).done( function( result ) { if ( result ) { return true; } else { return false; } )
[13:54:21] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:54:24] <robertmaxrees> you can't do that.
[13:54:40] <taplar> you could provide a deferred in the method and resolve with true or false
[13:54:55] <Uhkis> that's almost like running in to ubrs eggs yelling your name
[13:54:57] <robertmaxrees> right, but you still need to explicitly call the logic you want to call.
[13:55:04] <taplar> or just directly call whatever you would do in either case
[13:55:26] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:55:30] <robertmaxrees> do that.
[13:55:41] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> any of you have a pastebin to show me and I'll adapt to my request?
[13:55:48] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:55:59] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:56:13] <robertmaxrees> show us your code i guess.
[13:56:14] <taplar> if ( result ) { callTrueMethod(); } else { callFalseMethod(); }
[13:56:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:56:19] <robertmaxrees> ^ basically.
[13:56:24] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> I need this to be in a function, so I can't really "directly" call it.
[13:56:33] <robertmaxrees> show us your code.
[13:56:35] <robertmaxrees> i think you're confused.
[13:57:49] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> http://pastebin.com/XEkg5wUX
[13:58:01] <robertmaxrees> i really wish pastebin would kill the adds.
[13:58:04] <robertmaxrees> *ads
[13:58:14] <robertmaxrees> right, so what about the code that calls this?
[13:58:26] <taplar> public pastes listing is ..... odd today
[13:58:40] <taplar> lol
[13:58:42] <z1haze> does next() increment on its own?
[13:58:45] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> checkMaintCat ( 'Category:Sickles' );
[13:58:51] <robertmaxrees> z1haze what do you mean?
[13:58:53] <robertmaxrees> Leroy_Jenkins__1 *sigh*
[13:59:17] <robertmaxrees> Leroy_Jenkins__1 lol what taplar showed you earlier is what you need to do.
[13:59:34] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> I just want checkMaintCat( 'Category:Sickles' ) to tell me if it is true/false.
[13:59:41] <robertmaxrees> you cannot do that.
[13:59:50] <robertmaxrees> you need to pass in callbacks
[13:59:56] <z1haze> like i am doing el.find('input[name="whatever"]').next().text() to set text after a json response, but is ajax, so im wondering if i submit the form multiple times runnign this code, will it get a different element every time?
[14:00:14] <robertmaxrees> z1haze nope.
[14:00:19] <taplar> depends on if your creating new elements with that same name
[14:00:24] <robertmaxrees> jquery objects are stateless.
[14:00:38] <robertmaxrees> like, .next() doesn't "increment" anything by virtue.
[14:00:48] <z1haze> alright
[14:00:55] <robertmaxrees> nothing in jquery does that.
[14:02:43] <taplar> var pID = $.map( maintCheck.query.pages, function( v, id ){ return id } );  <-- that is weird.  wouldn't that just be getting the indexes?
[14:03:11] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> There's only 1 index
[14:03:28] <Uhkis> then it's even weirder
[14:03:37] <taplar> the method for map is ( value, index )
[14:03:41] <taplar> so that's returning the index
[14:03:51] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:04:05] <robertmaxrees> so you're looking for a list of indices.
[14:04:12] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> http://ddowiki.com/api.php?action=query&prop=categories&clcategories=Category:DDOwiki_maintenance_categories&titles=Category:Sickles&format=jsonfm
[14:04:24] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> That's an example of what the API returns.
[14:04:33] <taplar> a ddo dude!
[14:04:36] <taplar> yo man! :)
[14:04:42] <robertmaxrees> ah, running that not against an array.
[14:04:51] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> Yes, I'm http://ddowiki.com/page/U:Technical_13
[14:05:11] <taplar> ah, cool.  I'm Amundir on the forums
[14:05:42] <taplar> small world
[14:06:12] <robertmaxrees> i helped a dude a while back that i later figured out i actually worked with.
[14:06:17] <robertmaxrees> *work with, rather
[14:06:20] <taplar> nice
[14:06:30] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> I'll be streaming this evening (Eastern) on https://twitch.tv/technical_13 with https://twitch.tv/fathirdros and giving out 3 500TP codes and at the end a F2P player will get a starter pack.
[14:06:52] <taplar> nice of you
[14:08:47] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> So, I need to figure out how to do it with a callback.
[14:08:48] <taplar> anyway
[14:08:51] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:08:57] <taplar> i don't think you need that map
[14:09:07] <taplar> Object.keys(thatVariable)[0]
[14:09:07] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> My biggest weakness is promises and callbacks... :\
[14:09:13] <robertmaxrees> so i assume you've got something like if (myFunctionWithAjax)
[14:09:16] <robertmaxrees> {
[14:09:23] <robertmaxrees> right?
[14:09:27] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> That's the plan.
[14:09:58] <robertmaxrees> right, so instead you pull the code out of the if call, pop it into a function, and then modify your function to accept callbacks.
[14:10:03] <robertmaxrees> OR! you move your .done() call.
[14:10:17] <robertmaxrees> you return the get call and then you can do myFunctionWithAjax()done()
[14:10:52] <taplar> is done() still valid or should we be pointing people towards then() ?
[14:10:57] <robertmaxrees> err, thank you.
[14:11:05] <robertmaxrees> done() is still legit but then() is where you want to be.
[14:11:44] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> jQuery API show that the last event should be .done()
[14:11:46] <taplar> i'm assuming 3.X is going to make done() a wrapper for then.  *goes to take a peak*
[14:11:51] <robertmaxrees> Leroy_Jenkins__1 you want .then()
[14:12:14] <robertmaxrees> the docs clarify that .done() and .fail() are shortcuts for what .then() calls
[14:12:21] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> so .then().then().then() is okay instead of .then().then().done()?
[14:12:28] <robertmaxrees> uh
[14:12:33] <robertmaxrees> why are you chaining .then() calls?
[14:13:01] <robertmaxrees> you'd just want .then(yourSuccessCallback, yourFailCallback)
[14:13:19] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> I have another script that I have multiple things that rely on each other is a series that I do that on.
[14:13:27] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:13:31] <robertmaxrees> so then yeah.
[14:13:40] <robertmaxrees> you're confused by what the docs say.
[14:13:48] <robertmaxrees> the last handler (not event) can be .then()
[14:13:53] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> Yes, I read the docs...
[14:14:09] <robertmaxrees> where does it say it "ut: 260 seconds)
[14:14:09] <robertmaxrees> [2016:05:17:11:11:45] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> jQuery API show that the l
[14:14:12] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[14:14:19] <robertmaxrees> where did you see "the last event should be .done()"
[14:14:51] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> I don't remember, a page on jQuery I was reading for promises and callbacks.
[14:15:04] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> Was awhile ago last time I looked.
[14:15:08] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make any sense.
[14:15:22] <robertmaxrees> you may have been reading about the order things get called in.
[14:16:33] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> maybe
[14:16:38] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:16:55] <robertmaxrees> so yeah, you'll need to pass your code via callbacks or register your .then() differently.
[14:19:24] <Leroy_Jenkins__1> https://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/ shows multiples done()s chained, but I can't now find where I saw $.when().then().then().done(); or the sort.
[14:19:50] <robertmaxrees> sounds like maybe you made an assumption then?
[14:19:52] <robertmaxrees> who knows.
[14:29:31] <Miles8of9> $.post (etc etc etc) .success / .fail only means that form was submitted successfully or not or that its data was accepted by server?
[14:29:45] <taplar> it's based on the response code
[14:29:54] <robertmaxrees> or if the repsonse data was valid.
[14:31:49] <Miles8of9> so... if i send something via $.post i can make the server to return success or fail if data is valid etc
[14:31:59] <taplar> sure
[14:32:10] <robertmaxrees> you mean force jquery to resolve or reject the promise?  yeah.
[14:32:13] <robertmaxrees> http status codes :)
[14:32:17] <robertmaxrees> that's really what you want.
[14:32:20] <taplar> what's your backend?
[14:32:24] <Miles8of9> php
[14:32:28] <taplar> one sec
[14:33:04] <taplar> ex. header("HTTP/1.0 400 Bad Request");
[14:33:34] <Miles8of9> hmm.. ah ok thankyou
[14:33:40] <robertmaxrees> http://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html
[14:33:45] <robertmaxrees> for your full list of response codes.
[14:44:30] * dddh is back
[14:50:40] <tocka> Hi guys :)
[14:50:52] <tocka> Quick question, how could I achieve this kind of effect on images: http://www.eginstill.com/project/loft-val-thorens/
[14:51:09] <tocka> When you scroll down the right side of the image sort of moves.. Its hard to explain
[14:51:10] <tocka> :o
[14:51:44] <sadikaya> its parallax scrolling
[14:51:54] <robertmaxrees> inspect the page and see for yourself.
[14:51:56] <Uhkis> looks like the picture is a divs background-image and the div just expands a bit
[14:51:57] <robertmaxrees> not hard to do.
[15:03:37] <_TWG_> Has anyone worked with UIKit and their Offcanvas items before?
[15:03:59] <_TWG_> I'm trying to make an offcanvas area show up on mouse click but it's not.
[15:06:31] <taplar> robertmaxrees: you have any experience with Docker?
[15:06:46] <robertmaxrees> taplar very little with containers in general.
[15:06:56] <robertmaxrees> we have ops guys that do that sort of stuff heh.
[15:07:23] <taplar> cool.  just curious.  looks like someone is going to do a spike here with it
[15:07:31] <robertmaxrees> Oh?
[15:08:05] <taplar> yeah, see if we can use it to make our internal cloud a little more managable from a security standpoint I guess
[15:09:35] <gambl0re> hi robert, hows going?
[15:10:09] <taplar> he has an orange smile
[15:10:33] <taplar> dude love cheetos
[15:14:24] <Ikpeazu> Hello all. I am trying to determine the validity of a jQuery find function:
[15:14:34] <robertmaxrees> define "validity"
[15:14:51] <Ikpeazu> If this will do anything.
[15:15:00] <robertmaxrees> you mean if you selected something?
[15:15:00] <Ikpeazu> If this will do what I need it to.
[15:15:04] <Ikpeazu> Yes.
[15:15:05] <Technical_13> So... I'm still lazy.
[15:15:07] <Technical_13> https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T135544
[15:15:07] <robertmaxrees> .length
[15:15:09] <Uhkis> taplar: docker is pretty awesome
[15:15:28] <taplar> fixing to queue up some youtube vids
[15:15:28] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:22:53] <Technical_13> robertmaxrees: if I can't make a function to return true or false...
[15:23:10] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:23:13] <robertmaxrees> you'
[15:23:14] <Technical_13> I'll extend the mw.Api to do it for me!
[15:23:18] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[15:23:23] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to fix your problems.
[15:23:24] <taplar> you gotta change your paradigm view
[15:23:41] <taplar> it's event driven, not procedural
[15:23:41] <robertmaxrees> you're going to have the exact same struggles you're having no.
[15:23:44] <robertmaxrees> *now
[15:23:51] <robertmaxrees> so the ajax call will still be async.
[15:24:07] <robertmaxrees> show the function you're trying to return out of and the function that calls it.
[15:24:19] <jak2000> robertmaxrees done the work :)
[15:24:24] <jak2000> thanks
[15:24:31] <jak2000> and decx too helped
[15:25:37] <Technical_13> I won't need to have it in a function and will be able to directly call it.
[15:25:42] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[15:25:43] <robertmaxrees> what?
[15:25:47] <robertmaxrees> diurectly call what?
[15:25:58] <robertmaxrees> and clarify what you mean by "call"
[15:26:25] <Technical_13> if ( mw.Api.hasCategory( 'Cat:Sub-cat', 'Cat:Maint Cat' ) ) { ... alert( 'no deleting maint cats!' ) }
[15:26:33] <robertmaxrees> you literally don't need to do that.
[15:26:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:26:38] <robertmaxrees> you're overcomplicating this.
[15:27:07] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/ad6463d140aa
[15:27:09] <Technical_13> it uses a promise/callback.
[15:27:09] <robertmaxrees> this is all you need to do.
[15:27:29] <robertmaxrees> instead of trying to return out of the ajax call, move where you're doing your then.
[15:27:40] <robertmaxrees> no need to change the API, just a minor code modification.
[15:27:50] <Technical_13> I tried that.
[15:27:54] <Technical_13> Doesn't work.
[15:27:57] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[15:28:24] <robertmaxrees> because it should unless you're doing something really strange.
[15:29:18] <Technical_13> It returns: Object { state: .Deferred/promise.state(), always: .Deferred/promise.always(), then: .Deferred/promise.then(), promise: .Deferred/promise.promise(), pipe: .Deferred/promise.then(), done: jQuery.Callbacks/self.add(), fail: jQuery.Callbacks/self.add(), progress: jQuery.Callbacks/self.add() }
[15:29:22] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:29:28] <robertmaxrees> show me the code you're using.
[15:29:37] <Technical_13> MediaWiki is strange in some places.
[15:29:50] <robertmaxrees> your code used a $.get() call
[15:30:24] <robertmaxrees> you return the get call to the calling function and then attach your .then() handler there.
[15:30:39] <Technical_13> https://bpaste.net/show/e9318752ff13
[15:31:06] <Technical_13> My code doesn't use $.get(), it uses mw.Api.get()
[15:31:22] <Technical_13> It's not a direct coorelation.
[15:31:29] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:31:36] <robertmaxrees> lol that would've been great info a while ago.
[15:32:26] <taplar> what's the problem?  is the then() not working?
[15:32:59] <taplar> cause we already said earlier to just call your methods instead of returning true or false
[15:33:02] <Technical_13> https://doc.wikimedia.org/mediawiki-core/master/js/source/api.html#mw-Api-method-get
[15:34:10] <tocka> I have added some content using ajax
[15:34:19] <tocka> and I am trying to use closest() but it doesnt find anything :(
[15:34:28] <tocka> Google isnt helping also :|
[15:34:31] <robertmaxrees> Technical_13 yeah, so the get call returns the ajax call.
[15:34:36] <tocka> Im trying to find the closest element onScroll
[15:34:47] <robertmaxrees> tocka you're probably confused by what .closest() does.
[15:35:01] <tocka> find the closest matching element?
[15:35:04] <tocka> finds*
[15:35:08] <taplar> 'closest'
[15:35:11] <robertmaxrees> right, "closest" is ephemeral.
[15:35:16] <robertmaxrees> it goes "up" the tree.
[15:35:21] <tocka> Ooooooo...
[15:35:22] <robertmaxrees> searching through an elements ancestors.
[15:35:40] <Technical_13> robertmaxrees: I'd emphasize tree as well.
[15:35:45] <robertmaxrees> Technical_13 fwiw if (maintCheck.query.pages[pID[0]].categories !== undefined) { could be shortened to if (maintCheck.query.pages[pID[0]].categories) {
[15:35:55] <tocka> What should I use then to find the closest element? :/ When the users scrolls up or down... What would be the best way to achieve this? :o
[15:35:58] <robertmaxrees> Technical_13 lol i think he gets it - ancestors really helps that one click.
[15:36:02] <taplar> define 'closest'
[15:36:02] <robertmaxrees> tocka define "closest"
[15:36:06] <taplar> :)
[15:36:09] <robertmaxrees> is it a parent?  a child?  a sibling?
[15:36:30] <robertmaxrees> you need to better define what you're looking for.
[15:36:48] <robertmaxrees> so Technical_13 with your code, was is that the .then() call wasn't firing at all?
[15:36:49] <tocka> Let me think over this one more time.. I think I might be using the wrong approach for this :|
[15:37:12] <robertmaxrees> what about it wasn't working is what I'm getting at.
[15:37:45] <robertmaxrees> like, were you expecting to be able to do something like var myThing = checkMaintCat( 'Category:Sickles' ).then(function(maintCheck) {
[15:39:40] <Technical_13> Give me a few minutes to finish the code for the other parts and I'll put it all together...
[15:39:44] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[15:39:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:40:05] <robertmaxrees> should be pretty easy to clarify that point for me, but OK :)
[15:40:18] <robertmaxrees> my bigger point is you can't return out of a .then() like that.
[15:40:36] <robertmaxrees> you need to actually call the logic from inside your conditional.
[15:44:12] <Technical_13> Okay... So... https://bpaste.net/show/b3ad5d4e5d81
[15:45:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah, like I just explained, youc an't do that.
[15:45:12] <robertmaxrees> you cannot return out of .then() like that.
[15:45:31] <robertmaxrees> you need to explicitly call the logic you want instead.
[15:46:00] <robertmaxrees> also: onClick="processEmptyCat - you should be using event delegation instead, but that's a whole other subject.
[15:46:13] <Technical_13> So, the only way to do it is with a big nested mess of spaghetti code. :\  Okay.
[15:46:18] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[15:46:21] <robertmaxrees> duder lol
[15:46:28] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[15:47:41] <Technical_13> The only way for me to do it async and explicitly call the logic with the multiple API calls is to nest them, and I think that looks horrible
[15:47:57] <Technical_13> Yes, the key words in that sentence ar "for me"
[15:48:01] <robertmaxrees> or you abstract your method calls better. but that's not "the only way"
[15:48:09] <robertmaxrees> you just need to shuffle where you're doing things.
[15:49:22] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/34c2da19bdf6
[15:49:34] <robertmaxrees> i'd abstract some of that out more but you get the idea.
[15:50:57] <robertmaxrees> also: those exists/confirmation checks could be smashed down into a single if.
[15:51:40] <Technical_13> Yes, they probably could.  That was the part I was tossing together quick. :p
[15:51:49] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:52:10] <Technical_13> I could probably also do away with most of the replace()s and use something like encodeUriComponent() too
[15:52:16] <robertmaxrees> so yeah, some slight refactoring and some more abstraction would get you really far.  add in an .on() call instead of onclick() and you're fine.
[15:53:44] <Technical_13> Well... Nap time.
[15:53:53] <tocka> One more question :D
[15:54:15] <tocka> Im loading more pages when a user scrolls to the bottom of the page (well 700px before bottom)
[15:54:27] <tocka> The pages do load, but the problem is they load all at once.. Not one at a time :/
[15:54:28] <tocka> http://pastebin.com/i7fr8yea
[15:54:35] <tocka> And not really sure how to stop this
[15:55:48] <Technical_13> where are they loading from?
[15:56:22] <superware> Anyone happen to be from Denmark?
[15:56:29] <tocka> Technical_13 from a url .load(pageUrl + " .innerView > *"))
[15:56:41] <tocka> superware why would you ask that? :D
[15:57:16] <superware> I have a question related to the Internet in Denmark
[15:57:43] <tocka> :]
[16:27:31] <baako> hi guys, https://jsfiddle.net/mcr2bpka/ why does it think it is encoded?
[17:04:55] <proudbyte_> hi whats the jQuery equivalent to: var form = document.querySelector('form');  console.log(form.elements.username); ?
[17:05:16] <robertmaxrees> $('form') and then using .prop()
[17:05:39] <proudbyte_> so prop() is a jQuery method
[17:05:43] <robertmaxrees> yes
[17:06:20] <baako> robertmaxrees,
[17:06:25] <robertmaxrees> baako,
[17:07:01] <baako> can you have a look at the jsfiddle plz i am trying to valid base64
[17:07:09] <proudbyte_> it acts as a get method in this particular case right? I supose I would have to pass the field by parameter as a string value such as: console.log($(form).prop('username')); ?
[17:07:52] <proudbyte_> robertmaxrees it acts as a get method in this particular case right? I supose I would have to pass the field by parameter as a string value such as: console.log($(form).prop('username')); ?
[17:08:02] <robertmaxrees> i saw your the first time...
[17:08:15] <proudbyte_> robertmaxrees sorry
[17:08:15] <robertmaxrees> proudbyte_ like most jquery methods it's a getter, but you'd have to do two successive calls.
[17:08:21] <robertmaxrees> baako at what fiddle?
[17:08:42] <baako> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/mcr2bpka/1/
[17:09:06] <proudbyte_> robertmaxrees so first I have to get the dom object and parse to jQuery object
[17:09:14] <robertmaxrees> proudbyte_ huh?  no.
[17:09:30] <baako> i have tried the rejex and also windows.atob still thinks reza is base64
[17:09:35] <robertmaxrees> $('form').prop('elements').prop('username')
[17:09:43] <robertmaxrees> baa what do you mean?
[17:09:53] <robertmaxrees> baako what are you actually trying to accomplish?
[17:09:59] <proudbyte_> robertmaxrees well that looks bad
[17:10:04] <robertmaxrees> proudbyte_ yep.
[17:10:12] <baako> verify base64
[17:10:24] <robertmaxrees> proudbyte_ you could .get() the underlying node and then access the two props.
[17:10:30] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to use jquery for this?
[17:10:38] <robertmaxrees> baako so you eneed help with that regex?
[17:10:50] <baako> robertmaxrees, yes please
[17:11:19] <proudbyte_> robertmaxrees is there any other way of learning be3sides practical cases? guess not :) just for curiosity
[17:11:33] <robertmaxrees> hrm? you mean just learn how to use jquery?
[17:11:40] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com is a good place to start.
[17:11:54] <robertmaxrees> baako have you asked in ##javascript?
[17:12:14] <proudbyte_> robertmaxrees thank you
[17:12:31] <baako> robertmaxrees, yea i did but i did but none of the js pro is around
[17:12:50] <robertmaxrees> baako huh?
[17:21:42] <orentanay> I'm trying to track down the script that is adding a display:none to an element. I tried in chrome Break on attributes modification, but it doesn't break. I've done a view source, and the display none is not there, so I have to assume this is script, but how else can I find the offending code? thanks.
[17:22:14] <robertmaxrees> does a class get added?
[17:22:27] <robertmaxrees> like, how do you know the particular element is display: none; if it's not set on the element?
[17:22:31] <orentanay> no, just display:none
[17:22:57] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[17:22:59] <orentanay> I inspect the element next to it, then I can see my hidden element
[17:23:01] <arc_> view source shows the source before javascript runs
[17:23:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i spaced for a second.
[17:23:13] <robertmaxrees> so it's a script.
[17:23:26] <orentanay> yep, but how to find that script?
[17:23:56] <robertmaxrees> there's no convenient way to do this.  i'd grep your codebase the for the different classes on that element.
[17:23:57] <orentanay> I used the view source to prove that this was not hard coded on the element.
[17:24:07] <orentanay> bummer, thanks.
[17:24:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah, sorry.
[17:24:21] <robertmaxrees> unless somebody knows something I don't.
[18:01:34] <Freefood> Hey all, I have a scroll event and when you scrollTop less than x pixel it automatically animate scrollTop : 0 but the thing is the animation is not working 100% of the time (it always get fired but I think it get interrupted by the inertia of the scroll). Any Idea how to fix it ?
[18:04:56] <robertmaxrees> might need to do some kind of check to see if the animation is running.
[18:13:08] <taplar> throttle it
[18:13:18] <robertmaxrees> or debounce.
[18:13:59] <taplar> it's not so much 'inertia' as a scroll fires a ton of events
[18:15:13] <taplar> here's some reading: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[18:15:30] <taplar> i'm out yo
[18:15:33] <robertmaxrees> enjoy
[18:23:28] <Freefood_> tapout: thx will look it up
[18:23:39] <robertmaxrees> bad autocomplete ;)
[18:24:20] <Freefood_> indeed :D
[18:24:33] <Freefood_> I meant taplar but he is not logged in anymore
[18:24:45] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:31:22] <Freefood_> robertmaxrees: what did you mean by debounce instead of throttle ?
[18:31:44] <robertmaxrees> did you read that article taplar linked?
[18:32:14] <Freefood_> I started right after asking the question and realised it was in there
[18:32:15] <Freefood_> :p
[18:32:19] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:46:14] <Freefood_> robertmaxrees: So I have tried both throttling and debounce and it does not work as I inted. I have my first scene (which 100% of the screen) that is a one scroll step after that I have a navbar that switch from relative to fixed (worked great before) and when I go back up my navbar pass to relative again and I scroll to the top but right now with debounce / throttle the navbar fixed to relative lags a lot be
[18:46:14] <Freefood_> hind the actual scroll break point while the scrollTop seem smooth
[18:46:33] <robertmaxrees> err.
[18:46:37] <robertmaxrees> that's a lot of text
[18:46:39] <robertmaxrees> do you have a fiddle
[18:46:39] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:58:30] <Freefood_> robertmaxrees: I'll try to make one :)
[19:19:40] <Freefood_> robertmaxrees: something like this : https://jsfiddle.net/8ezev9e4/ I must admit it works better on the fiddle than in my project :p
[19:20:42] <Freefood_> robertmaxrees: I only implemented the one step going up right now, and since it already doesn't work I haven't messed with the step going down
[19:29:22] <robertmaxrees> so what's happening and what do you expect to happen?
[19:30:04] <Freefood_> well it's the exact same code as my project and on my project the navbar flashes very rapidly as fixed then become relative again for some reason (it didn't do that when not bounced)
[19:30:17] <Freefood_> don't get why it looks like it's working on jsfiddle
[19:30:54] <Freefood_> I'm a dummy
[19:31:17] <Freefood_> I changed the name of my files and I had therefore 2 file (one bounced one not bounced in compiled js)
[19:31:22] <robertmaxrees> heh./
[19:31:24] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[19:31:38] <Freefood_> Thanks for being the best rubber duck ever :D
[19:31:45] <robertmaxrees> always ;)
[19:31:47] <Freefood_> and well for solving the initial problem :)
[19:49:14] <Freefood_> robertmaxrees: can I force scroll to stop at a break point ? because sometimes when i scroll too fast there is some scroll inertia and it jitter with the start of the animation
[19:49:34] <robertmaxrees> you want to preventDefault() instead.
[20:36:39] <notchris-work> Hey robet
