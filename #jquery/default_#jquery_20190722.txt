[10:40:06] <Ownix> Noob question, methods like these, do they return the orig matched elements or do they return whatever you passed in as the new content? https://api.jquery.com/after/
[10:42:03] <taplar> Ownix yes, unless stated otherwise, jQuery methods return the jQuery object they are called off of
[10:42:49] <Ownix> Thanks
[11:56:48] <Es0teric> anyone know a good progress bar library for jquery?
[12:06:35] <robertmaxrees> lots of choices Es0teric :)
[12:29:41] <taplar> heh, i was playing around with this a couple days ago https://codepen.io/anon/pen/gVOQaz?editors=1100
[15:09:08] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees i was thinking more of a progress bar plugin that has a certain amount of results then displays how much of x has loaded until it is complete
[15:10:36] <taplar> what does "loaded" refer to?
[15:10:49] <robertmaxrees> also "certain amount of results"
[15:16:53] <Es0teric> loaded would refer to the amount of records the user sees and "amount of results" would be the amount of records retrieved
[15:17:30] <taplar> so you're wanting to use a progress bar to tell the user paging information?
[15:17:42] <Es0teric> i suppose
[15:19:16] <taplar> what is the process like that pulls the results?
[15:19:46] <robertmaxrees> oh you're not looking for an ajax progress bar?
[15:22:30] <robertmaxrees> my bad
[16:38:10] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees it is kind of an ajax loading bar and it kind of isnt
[16:38:33] <robertmaxrees> okay but like, in programming, things aren't "kind of", they are or aren't :)
[16:38:45] <taplar> which is why i asked about the process
[16:38:52] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:38:56] <robertmaxrees> there's a reason we need more details.
[16:39:22] <robertmaxrees> -_-
[16:41:06] <taplar> because if it's not driven off of an ajax completion, and you are driving it just off of paging results (or something you control and know the current position and range of), then https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/progress/ can work for that
[16:41:22] <robertmaxrees> they already left.
[16:41:38] <taplar> for those of you who read the logs, i hope you agree.
[16:41:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:41:56] <robertmaxrees> also: i dunno that I'd suggest bootstrap, unless you're already using bootstrap.
[16:42:23] <taplar> well, if not, maybe they can get an idea for the css related to hand rolling their own
[16:42:58] <robertmaxrees> sure - just making the point :)
[18:38:04] <diverdude> I have this code: http://jsfiddle.net/bsw5s60j/9/   How can i add a type to the nodes so that i know when i am clicking on a leaf node?
[19:32:31] <kiwi_73> hi, how can i read form data?
