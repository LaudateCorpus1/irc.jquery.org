[00:00:39] <jasonMomoa> tried .text(substring(10,15));
[00:00:42] <jasonMomoa> does not work
[00:00:58] <jalnt> yeah you need to pass the text() method a string
[00:01:16] <jalnt> substring() is a method of a String object
[00:01:24] <jalnt> one sec
[00:01:31] <jasonMomoa> English, please... :)
[00:01:49] <jasonMomoa> so... make two vars?
[00:02:04] <jalnt> $(".someDiv").text($(".someDiv").text().substring(10,15);
[00:02:11] <jasonMomoa> oh
[00:02:23] <jalnt> or...
[00:02:32] <jalnt> var text = $(".someDiv").text();
[00:02:35] <jasonMomoa> D'oh!
[00:02:40] <jalnt> $(".someDiv").text(text)
[00:03:10] <jalnt> the text method can be used to both get the text inside an element, and to set it
[00:03:24] <jasonMomoa> the first one worked as a charm!
[00:03:32] <jalnt> yep
[00:03:39] <jalnt> looks a bit unreadable though I think lol
[00:03:40] <jasonMomoa> I couldn't understand why they put it in html() in the first place
[00:04:03] <jalnt> you mean why does the html() method exist?
[00:04:19] <jasonMomoa> in combination with substring
[00:04:24] <jasonMomoa> I found an example online
[00:04:31] <jasonMomoa> and was trying to work my way backwards
[00:04:37] <jasonMomoa> to understand what was going on
[00:04:49] <jasonMomoa> thats why I've put substring into text()
[00:04:58] <jalnt> ah
[00:05:39] <jalnt> yeah you do want to use substring() and text()
[00:05:53] <jasonMomoa> right
[00:06:03] <jasonMomoa> and now I will implement your .each
[00:06:28] <jalnt> but you need to use text() twice - once to get the text and a second time to set the text to a substring
[00:06:40] <jalnt> I would turn it into a function
[00:07:18] <jasonMomoa> I'm still novice with jQuery
[00:08:13] <jalnt> and then do something like $(".parent").children().each(turnIntoSubstring($(this)));
[00:08:30] <jalnt> I'll make a jsfiddle actually because it sounds interesting
[00:08:55] <jasonMomoa> I will show you mine
[00:09:22] <jalnt> cool
[00:10:15] <jasonMomoa> http://pastebin.com/7mRKXzVj
[00:10:32] <jasonMomoa> it does not work... :)
[00:11:48] <jasonMomoa> maybe I'm using each() wrong
[00:14:19] <jalnt> I'm making a jsfiddle example now
[00:14:48] <jalnt> yeah I don't think that's right
[00:15:07] <jasonMomoa> thank you
[00:20:02] <jalnt> alright you still there?
[00:20:31] <jasonMomoa> yes
[00:20:37] <jasonMomoa> I'm working on a toggle
[00:20:39] <jalnt> http://jsfiddle.net/q4xjgoxa/1/
[00:20:42] <jasonMomoa> toggleClass
[00:20:54] <jalnt> Check out that fiddle
[00:21:11] <jasonMomoa> opening it now
[00:21:19] <jasonMomoa> my connection is really slow
[00:21:27] <jasonMomoa> currently I have a ping of 1300
[00:21:40] <jalnt> haha I know that feeling well
[00:22:26] <jasonMomoa> ok I get the first part of the function
[00:22:45] <jasonMomoa> however I'm not shorthening the exact same div, but rather moving the shortened value into another div
[00:22:56] <jasonMomoa> but I will figure it out...
[00:22:57] <jalnt> that's easy too
[00:23:00] <jasonMomoa> I hope
[00:23:06] <jalnt> I'll make another fiddle, one sec
[00:23:09] <jasonMomoa> maybe just write a selector on line 8?
[00:23:12] <jalnt> well, I'll edit this one
[00:23:16] <jasonMomoa> ok
[00:34:49] <jalnt> jasonMomoa: Still there?
[00:34:58] <jasonMomoa> of course
[00:35:04] <jalnt> Here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/q4xjgoxa/2/
[00:35:08] <jasonMomoa> I've completed toggleClass I had
[00:35:34] <jalnt> This one is a bit trickier
[00:35:44] <jasonMomoa> okkkk...
[00:36:01] <jasonMomoa> what does line 4 do?
[00:36:33] <jalnt> It uses the index of the long string div in its parent container and changes the text of the div at the same index in another container
[00:36:55] <jasonMomoa> ok
[00:37:00] <jalnt> depending on how your code is set up, it may or may not be a good solution for you
[00:37:01] <jasonMomoa> ugh. let me try it
[00:37:59] <jalnt> it should work if the long string divs are all in one parent container, and the divs you want to output to and in a separate parent container
[00:38:17] <jalnt> brb
[00:38:19] <jasonMomoa> I will update the fiddle
[00:38:20] <jasonMomoa> ok
[00:41:52] <jalnt> I'll be back in about 30 mins
[00:41:57] <jalnt> gonna go grab some food
[00:42:02] <jasonMomoa> can you just check this out
[00:42:11] <jasonMomoa> http://pastebin.com/HGtNBQVC
[00:42:11] <jasonMomoa> this is what I'm trying to do
[00:42:12] <jalnt> sure
[00:42:12] <jalnt> oh wow
[00:42:12] <jalnt> here we go
[00:42:30] <jasonMomoa> so... I combined what I have and what you have
[00:42:38] <jasonMomoa> :/
[00:42:47] <jasonMomoa> I don't have var maxitralala
[00:43:07] <jasonMomoa> but thats where I want to put the shortString
[00:43:28] <jasonMomoa> I know I tumbled everything around but you get the picture...
[00:44:44] <jasonMomoa> The process is - 1) grab the text 2) substring text 3) place it into HTML code 4) append with before() 5) hide the original
[00:45:03] <jalnt> this line here: var outputDiv = $("div.select--small.no-search").each().before("<span id=\"replacebox_list_price\">"+ maxitralala +"&euro;</span>");
[00:45:06] <jalnt> is wrong
[00:45:11] <jasonMomoa> I know
[00:45:21] <jalnt> I'm not sure what you want to do here
[00:45:26] <jasonMomoa> The process is - 1) grab the text 2) substring text 3) place it into HTML code 4) append with before() 5) hide the original
[00:45:49] <jasonMomoa> I'm stuck on 3 and 4
[00:45:55] <jalnt> hm
[00:46:01] <jalnt> not sure
[00:46:16] <jalnt> I can help when I get back if you're still here but I'm gonna go get dinner
[00:46:26] <jasonMomoa> ok :)
[00:46:28] <jalnt> can't think when I'm hungry lol
[00:46:31] <jasonMomoa> I will find a way
[00:46:32] <jalnt> bbs
[00:46:36] <jasonMomoa> no problem
[00:46:41] <jasonMomoa> have a nice dinner
[00:46:46] <jasonMomoa> thanks for the help!
[00:47:02] <jalnt> just keep in mind, it should all be working but you're problem is selecting the element you want to output to
[00:47:09] <jalnt> that's what you gotta figure out
[00:47:11] <jalnt> alright bye
[01:10:00] <jasonMomoa> I'm having an issue with each
[01:10:13] <jasonMomoa> I have 10 rows with text
[01:10:22] <jasonMomoa> (in span tag's)
[01:10:45] <jasonMomoa> I wanted to go through each of them and shorten the value
[01:11:11] <jasonMomoa> problem is each is returning ALL of the shortened values for each of the rows
[01:11:12] <jalnt> back
[01:11:19] <jasonMomoa> not 1 shortened value per 1 row
[01:11:23] <jasonMomoa> hey jalnt
[01:11:27] <jasonMomoa> I've managed to do what I wanted
[01:11:36] <jasonMomoa> but each is throwing too many results
[01:11:52] <jasonMomoa> I'm going to pastebin the code
[01:12:04] <jasonMomoa> I've started from what you wrote
[01:12:04] <jalnt> alright
[01:12:07] <jasonMomoa> that gave me an idea
[01:13:26] <jasonMomoa> http://pastebin.com/wGxaFcwW
[01:13:30] <jasonMomoa> 4 lines of code
[01:13:32] <jasonMomoa> very simple
[01:13:37] <jasonMomoa> but...
[01:13:54] <jasonMomoa> instead of shortening 1 item per 1 row
[01:14:00] <jasonMomoa> it shortens all of the items per each row
[01:14:10] <jasonMomoa> so instead of 9.99 in a row
[01:14:15] <jasonMomoa> I get 9.99 9.99 9.99 9.99 9.99 9.99 9.99 9.99 9.99 9.99 9.99 9.99 9.99 9.99 9.99 9.99
[01:15:15] <jasonMomoa> sorry
[01:15:18] <jasonMomoa> pastebin is off
[01:15:50] <jasonMomoa> this one is correct > http://pastebin.com/s0e6GsZ8
[01:17:44] <jasonMomoa> jalnt?
[01:17:49] <jasonMomoa> are you here?
[01:17:54] <jasonMomoa> there? :)
[01:17:59] <jalnt> sorry was in another window
[01:18:05] <jalnt> one sec
[01:20:47] <jalnt> jasonMomoa: Okay, two things
[01:20:51] <jalnt> This line here: $("div.select--small.no-search").before("<span id=\"replacebox_list_price\">"+ maxitralala +"&euro;</span>");
[01:21:18] <jasonMomoa> right
[01:21:34] <jalnt> The selector $("div.select--small.no-search") is selecting every div with that class
[01:21:42] <jasonMomoa> right
[01:21:58] <jalnt> Every single div with that class, not just the one you want
[01:22:10] <jasonMomoa> yes, I want to select all of them
[01:22:15] <jasonMomoa> the selector construct is good
[01:22:40] <jalnt> I don't think so but anyway
[01:22:42] <jasonMomoa> I just dont want to add the shortened thing over and over and over again in each of the rows
[01:22:45] <jasonMomoa> just 1 for 1
[01:22:57] <jalnt> next problem, you're using .before()
[01:23:17] <jasonMomoa> I'm using before to append the content to that div
[01:23:20] <jalnt> which adds the shortened string to the beginning of the text every time it's called
[01:23:26] <jasonMomoa> oooooh
[01:23:56] <jalnt> and because the selector isn't right, it's adding the text over and over again
[01:24:07] <jasonMomoa> understood
[01:24:20] <jalnt> .each() loops through each div and runs that code each time
[01:24:27] <jasonMomoa> right!
[01:24:53] <jalnt> in the code that runs, *every* single div is being selected, and having text prepended to it with .before()
[01:25:05] <jasonMomoa> now I get
[01:25:07] <jasonMomoa> it
[01:26:04] <jasonMomoa> so... how do I fix that?
[01:26:05] <jalnt> in the .each() loop, you should have some code like this:
[01:26:30] <jasonMomoa> ok
[01:26:42] <jalnt> var longStringIndex = $(this).index();
[01:26:56] <jasonMomoa> ok
[01:27:39] <jalnt> $(".parent-container-of-short-strings").children().eq(longStringIndex).text(maxitralala)
[01:28:22] <jasonMomoa> can I use?  $(".parent-container-of-short-strings").children().eq(index).text(maxitralala)
[01:28:33] <jalnt> .children() basically returns an array containing all of the child elements of a container
[01:28:50] <jasonMomoa> and where does HTML I wanted to add comes into place/
[01:28:52] <jasonMomoa> and where does HTML I wanted to add comes into place?
[01:29:05] <jalnt> that's what .text() does
[01:29:12] <jalnt> .text(maxitralala)
[01:29:29] <jasonMomoa> but...
[01:30:10] <jalnt> that line gets the children of the parent container, then gets the element at the index you tell it, then changes the text of that element
[01:30:50] <jasonMomoa> ok...
[01:30:51] <jalnt> you basically have two lists of elements, one is the container with all the div's containing the long strings
[01:30:58] <jasonMomoa> right
[01:31:17] <jalnt> the other is the container with empty divs/spans/whatever
[01:31:34] <jalnt> which will have the outputs
[01:32:11] <jalnt> and they both have the same amount of divs
[01:32:27] <jasonMomoa> right
[01:32:46] <jalnt> so you loop through the first list, get the index of each element, then change the text of the element in the second list at that same index
[01:33:08] <jalnt> do you know what I mean?
[01:33:38] <jasonMomoa> kinnda
[01:35:37] <jalnt> gotta go
[01:36:02] <jasonMomoa> ok, thanks for the help
[01:36:18] <jasonMomoa> I will try to get it working

[18:47:51] <jean-pedro> hi
[18:53:45] <jean-pedro> I have an issue with jquery. I'm using <select><option>...tags on my page. Then I'm using $('#foo').change(function())} selector to get the value when <select> change. It works fine, but when I'm using <div> to dynamically display <select> tags, on change the selector '#foo' is not called. Do you knwo what's going on ?
[20:05:36] <uskerine> hi, how can I check if a given input named "id" has value or not?
[20:07:39] <derstrom> uskerine: $('input[name=id]') - is that what you are referring to?
[20:08:23] <derstrom> this returns an object for <input type="..." name="id">
[20:09:20] <uskerine> derstrom and what should I do in order to see if attribute value has something assigned or not?
[20:10:54] <derstrom> uskerine: if you want to see if the value of a text field is empty or not, do a check against $('input[name=id']).val().length
[20:11:12] <derstrom> .val() returns the value of the input field
[20:11:25] <uskerine> thanks
[20:12:13] <derstrom> no problem
[20:16:03] <uskerine> if ($(input[name="id"]).val().length>0) {
[20:16:11] <uskerine> should it be something like that
[20:16:12] <uskerine> ?
[20:18:20] <jean-pedro> I have an issue with jquery. I'm using <select><option>...tags on my page. Then I'm using $('#foo').change(function())} selector to get the value when <select> change. It works fine, but when I'm using <div> to dynamically display <select> tags, on change the selector '#foo' is not called. Do you knwo what's going on ?
[20:19:48] <derstrom> uskerine: you can just do if($('input[name="id"]').val().length) as if the length is 0, it has a boolean value of false
[20:19:59] <derstrom> no need to check if it's more than 0
[20:21:46] <derstrom> uskerine: so the conditional statement above tells the browser to execute the code block if length is NOT false
[20:22:25] <uskerine> well I am looking to check if value is not ""
[20:22:25] <uskerine> ?
[20:22:48] <uskerine> also I am running that check inside a .click() button function of a modal bootstrap
[20:22:49] <derstrom> yes and '' has a length of 0
[20:22:59] <derstrom> and because length = 0, the boolean value is false
[20:23:04] <uskerine> ok
[20:23:06] <uskerine> so the check is fine then
[20:23:13] <uskerine> I want to determine if there is assigned value or not
[20:23:41] <derstrom> both ways is fine, but I'm just telling you ">0" is not necessary for what you want to do
[20:25:38] <uskerine> understood thanks. It does not work, might it be that    $(input[name="id"]) is not being found?
[20:26:22] <derstrom> Can you provide a jsfiddle.net example of your code? Best way to debug problems.
[20:28:03] <uskerine> it is quite difficult to provide a fiddle in this case, it is a python generated web site
[20:28:30] <derstrom> You just need to paste the line of the javascript code and the <input> HTML
[20:35:56] <Mark___> is there anyway i can use ajax to load the contents inside a div layer rather than going to a separate page for the content like this website? https://www.behance.net/
[20:36:48] <derstrom> Mark___: $.post() and $.get() might help, there's a parameter that allows you to call a function that captures the content from the page requested
[20:37:09] <Mark___> ah. thanks but im a jquery newbie, i have no clue what to do with it lol
[20:37:24] <derstrom> Oh it's very simple, give me a minute.
[20:37:34] <derstrom> It has to be on the same domain though
[20:37:38] <Mark___> like the webste i have you,
[20:37:43] <Mark___> *gave
[20:37:56] <Mark___> this one loads contents on a div without moving into another one/
[20:38:01] <derstrom> Due to something called same-origin policy
[20:38:10] <Mark___> i have my own website.
[20:38:12] <derstrom> is the page you want to pull content from on the same website?
[20:38:34] <Mark___> yeah. could you take a look at this? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/htmlcss/2297
[20:38:53] <Mark___> im trying to make this board into the one that i showed you
[20:40:00] <derstrom> Mark___: So here's how you would send a POST request to example.html. https://jsfiddle.net/ock0rg10/ You will notice in the second parameter we have a function that is fired when the page has been requested. The content on the page is returned into the pageContent variable.
[20:40:28] <derstrom> Hopefully this basic example will help direct you.
[20:40:47] <Mark___> oh.
[20:40:51] <derstrom> You can use either $.post or $.get. For what you want to do, the result is the same.
[20:41:16] <Mark___> so it loads the specified adress into a div ?
[20:41:31] <derstrom> It doesn't load the address, but the content on the page from example.html
[20:41:40] <Mark___> okay. i will try. thanks
[21:33:45] <Mark___> how do i change the following code for the onclick=“ “ usage?
[21:33:46] <Mark___> jQuery.post('example.html', function(pageContent) {
[21:33:47] <Mark___>     jQuery('.content').html(pageContent);
[21:37:43] <Mark___> oh, rather
[21:37:55] <Mark___> how do i make it load, only the specific div layer
[21:38:00] <Mark___> rather than the whole html?
[21:38:44] <derstrom> Mark___ I am not sure what you mean by that.
[21:38:55] <Mark___> the code you gave me loads entire page
[21:39:06] <Mark___> but i wonder if i can load only the targeted div layer.
[21:39:34] <Mark___> *inside that html
[21:39:47] <derstrom> Yes that's possible using .load()
[21:39:57] <derstrom> One moment,I'll give you an example
[21:40:08] <Mark___> thanks. and sorry for the dumb question.
[21:43:44] <derstrom> Mark___ Something like: $('div').load('example.html #example');
[21:43:58] <derstrom> on example.html, you'd have <div id="example"> (change as appropriate)
[21:44:00] <Mark___> and is there anyway i can make it scrollable?
[21:44:47] <derstrom> well I suspect you need to make the container on the page that has the .load() being called to have a CSS property of "overflow: auto", this is on the assumption the container has a fixed height
[21:46:57] <derstrom> You should also familiarise yourself with the jQuery documentation, as it may help. You are welcome to ask questions on  IRC, of course. That's what this channel exists for.
[21:47:26] <derstrom> Admittedly the documentation can be a little unfriendly to new users but it can be very helpful.
[21:48:17] <derstrom> The docs will also help you understand the "why" and "how" something works in jQuery.

[21:48:31] <Mark___> alright. thanks.
[22:00:14] <esaym> if I do something like $('#thing').append('<div class="thing2" />'), what is the best way to select 'thing2'? append() doesn't return it.. so just treat it as a regular selection
[22:00:17] <esaym> ?
