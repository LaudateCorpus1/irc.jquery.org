[02:24:44] <DanielCE> if i got var someDiv = $("body").children(".x") and on someDiv i got some event lister, in case in some part of my code i reassign someDiv = $("body").children(".x"), the event listener should be triggered again?
[02:25:00] <DanielCE> triggered = assigned*
[02:25:22] <arthurvr> No, event listeners get attached to an element, not to a variable.
[02:27:54] <DanielCE> but if the someDiv was removed
[02:28:15] <arthurvr> Whoops misread your question
[02:28:18] <arthurvr> it will perfectly work
[02:28:28] <DanielCE> someDiv.remove() , someDiv = $("body").children(".x")
[02:28:54] <DanielCE> ok let me show u the order of the things
[02:29:00] <arthurvr> yeah that’s gonna help
[02:29:15] <arthurvr> jsbin/jsfiddle :p
[02:29:43] <DanielCE>  var someDiv = $("body").children(".x") ,  someDiv.on("click",".button"..{} , someDiv.remove() , someDiv = $("body").children(".x")
[02:30:02] <DanielCE> so if i get to the end of that and then i click on .button its gonna work?
[02:31:51] <arthurvr> well there’s not going to be any children anymore then :p
[02:31:57] <arthurvr> you .remove()’d them
[02:31:58] <arthurvr> :p
[02:32:29] <arthurvr> DanielCE: create a reduced testcase on Jsbin/jsfiddle so we can perfectly see the problem your facing
[02:34:22] <DanielCE> let me js fiddle
[02:36:07] <DanielCE> http://jsfiddle.net/0r8vns9a/1/
[02:36:09] <DanielCE> i guess not
[02:36:33] <arthurvr> nope
[03:31:23] <Juslintek> Hi is there inbuilt slider, swiper whatever in jquery mobile that does image switching function, when you drag or click arrow.
[03:40:17] <fattest> I need to add process data to my ajax post, how do I do this? http://pastebin.com/L072MKKR
[03:41:18] <fattest> is it possible without using $.ajax ?
[04:08:35] <hellyeah> hey anyone here
[04:08:41] <arthurvr> hellyeah: hey there
[04:09:09] <hellyeah> hey arthurvr sup
[04:10:57] <cbg-fynrir> I'm unable to get this code working correctly. I need the background images that rotate to follow the size of the viewport in real time: https://jsfiddle.net/vyvkfasd/1/
[04:11:28] <cbg-fynrir> Also I have no idea why it's not displaying in the view port on jsFiddle.
[04:11:52] <cbg-fynrir> At the moment, the images are always full sized.
[04:17:04] <cbg-fynrir> Managed to get it working in jsFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/vyvkfasd/3/
[04:20:52] <hellyeah> thats nice
[04:21:52] <cbg-fynrir> It still does not respect viewport at all.
[04:21:57] <cbg-fynrir> The size does not change.
[04:56:50] <phale> can anyone explain this to me? $("#id")[0] has some functions it, how though if it's a HTML object tag?
[04:57:08] <phale> for instance, $("#id")[0].func("test");
[04:57:21] <mdev> console.log it
[04:57:25] <mdev> then take a look see
[04:58:02] <mdev> make sure you don't specify anything but console.log($("#id")[0])
[04:58:13] <phale> <object width="960" height="640" data="client.swf" id="id" type="application/x-shockwave-flash">
[04:58:48] <mdev> can't help you with shock man, no clue how to get whatever that exposes
[04:59:01] <mdev> with flash rather
[04:59:12] <phale> well does anyone here know
[05:01:56] <mdev> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7657842/how-to-call-flash-actionscript-callback-method-from-javascript

[05:10:21] <phale> how do I get all the methods from the object
[05:15:02] <DanielCEd> hwy guys wondering something if i do var x=$(".x"), y=$(".y") . how do i add event listeners for x and y ? $(x,y).on not working
[05:33:04] <mdev> does inspect console show any errors Daniel?
[05:33:15] <mdev> on appears to be the preferred method but can try bind I guess

[05:41:31] <hellyeah> anyone here?
[05:42:54] <BoomKa> yea
[05:43:17] <hellyeah> do you know about jquery modal window
[05:43:52] <BoomKa> now what?
[05:44:18] <hellyeah> when i first click button modal window appear at the position i want but after closing and opening modal window again it appears at the down of the page. How can i fix that?
[05:45:46] <hellyeah> any comment
[06:10:27] <BoomKa> hellyeah use fancybox
[06:11:24] <BoomKa> or own-carusel
[06:11:36] <BoomKa> or something else
[06:14:17] <hellyeah> BoomKa:
[06:14:25] <hellyeah> why fancybox
[06:23:55] <BoomKa> hellyeah at here  https://github.com/vjik/arcticModal
[06:26:11] <BoomKa> hellyeah but i love fancybox more
[06:29:42] <hellyeah> BoomKa:  reason of that?
[06:32:56] <Utils> What exactly is _.fn.init[0]? Does that contain the element selected? I'm trying to scroll to a div but it's not working so I did console.dir on $elem and I get_.fn.init[0]
[06:33:02] <Utils> but i can't exactly find the element itself.
[06:33:25] <Utils> I was hoping that "var $elem = $('div#' + window.location.hash.substr(1));" would select the div with id rpl-25 for example.
[06:34:06] <Utils> oh...
[06:34:15] <Utils> it should be rply-25 oops

[07:30:34] <jak2000> hi friends
[07:31:30] <jak2000> i added 10 rows onmy html table, how to know the HTML generated? (if i do rightclick on my page i only see Jquery code) thanks)
[09:14:43] <saile> hello there
[09:15:11] <saile> i need small help i tried to bind different event to element but only one event is firing up at moment
[09:58:47] <DjinnASD> i have a problem where i generate some pictures from instagram inside a collapsible accordian. It create some white speces in the bottom of the page in my jquery mobile app. Any pointer to what im doing wrong here.
[10:09:42] <jak2000> done the validation: http://jsfiddle.net/qhym3n6x/25/  but.... test: 1) put a "A" and press tab, it was validated... right? "Invalid qty2: A"  ok but lost the focus (the focus was on the button) how to solve? thanks
[10:28:57] <Juslintek> Hi, I have this problem, jquery mobile specific: http://www.kklietkabelis.tk/?am_force_theme_layout=mobile at the bottom I have swiper enabled, but when I walk through menus, it becomes inactive and fixed header start to appear or disappear when you click on the screen. As well gallery css becomes disabled. Please help, can't find help anywhere as well no errors at all...
[10:29:35] <Juslintek> version 1.4.5
[10:30:02] <Juslintek> I need to fix this issues till tomorrow...
[10:30:17] <Juslintek> :-( Scared and crying. Dang thats tough problem.
[10:32:48] <Juslintek> After refresh it all works, I've disabled ajax as as well via extend mobile jQuery(document).bind("mobileinit", function () { jQuery.mobile.ajaxEnabled = false; });
[10:33:33] <Juslintek> Problem persists. If it was ajax all the time being called, then on success I would need to reinit all the functions, but I can't as I don't know what and where and how...
[10:33:50] <Zeranoe> Will jquery assign $(this) when being called in a function? <button onclick="process()"></button> function process() { $(this).addClass("red"); }
[10:34:40] <arc_> because you're in an onclick event, $(this) is what you clicked on
[10:35:26] <Zeranoe> arc_: Will <button> add the "red" class?
[10:35:51] <arc_> i'm actually not 100% sure about doing it exactly how you have it
[10:41:45] <Zeranoe> arc_: fixed with: <button onclick="process(this)"></button> function process(t) { $(t).addClass("red"); }
[10:41:56] <jak2000> Zeranoe:
[10:42:01] <jak2000> can you test:
[10:42:14] <arc_> cool
[10:42:14] <jak2000> done the validation: http://jsfiddle.net/qhym3n6x/25/  but.... test: 1) put a "A" and press tab, it was validated... right? "Invalid qty2: A"  ok but lost the focus (the focus was on the button) how to solve? thanks
[11:02:12] <Juslintek> so much for the support, just needed to remove script from document ready lol :-D
[11:15:58] <Ice_Strike> When I use slideToggle
[11:16:04] <Ice_Strike> How to use check if it close or Open.
[11:16:09] <Ice_Strike> like boolian ?
[11:52:19] <_u2pop_> hello all
[11:52:37] <_u2pop_> how can i set a timeout for 5 second to do a click in this line
[11:52:37] <_u2pop_> document.getElementsByClassName("confirm-vote")[0].click();
[11:54:42] <arc_> trying to make a bot to vote on something?
[11:55:10] <_u2pop_> i want to set a timeout
[11:55:58] <_u2pop_> can be possible that?
[11:59:29] <arc_> oh i misunderstood i guess
[12:00:05] <arc_> you would have to disable the button and set a timeout to reenable it
[13:14:12] <sebbers_> hello!
[13:45:39] <Ice_Strike> $(this).closest('tr').next('tr');
[13:45:54] <Ice_Strike> Is there a way to get what is the number of this tr?
[13:46:41] <sebbers_> like the count
[13:46:47] <sebbers_> or an attribute?
[13:46:58] <sebbers_> do you mean the number of tr's
[13:47:17] <arc_> i'm guessing he means which one it is within the parent element
[13:49:47] <arc_> in which case use index()
[14:10:35] <jak2000> hi friends, how to validate an array of inputs, here my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/megmLd4a/6/  for validate accept only numbers.
[15:02:03] <Whirled> how do I go about making an jquery-wrapped input object that auto-updates it's ID and name when appended to the dom?
[15:02:17] <Whirled> can I put a function call in the name and id properties?
[15:04:50] <Whirled> ....'@'....{tumbleweed blows by with a haunting whistle in the background}
[15:10:13] <shoky> Whirled: you can't do that.. what do you need it to update to
[15:16:32] <Whirled> drats. Thanks shoky!
[15:27:18] <Whirled> What's the best way to select all elements with display=none inline style ? $.filter or is there a "select by attribute value" shortcut?
[15:30:22] <Polluticon> Whirled - did you try $("[attribute=value]")   ?
[15:30:54] <Whirled> $("*[style*='none']").css("display","block");
[15:31:36] <Whirled> I finally got it. Since it was in style attribute, it wasn't working at first...."style='display:none color:red'" for example.
[15:31:57] <Polluticon> nice
[15:32:40] <Whirled> now, granted this will also return all elements with    style='border:none'   but it's not a big oversight, I guess
[15:38:01] <Whirled> Okay. Now there has to be a way to deteremine if the first child element of an li element is an anchor element.
[15:39:13] <Whirled> I have tried finding the first "a" element and comparing it to the first child element using .is() and got no results.
[15:40:20] <arc_> why can't you just find the first child element and use .is('a')
[15:45:46] <Whirled> well, because that would be simple now wouldn't it. I always have to make things harder than need. Jeesh...lol
[15:45:54] <Whirled> but seriously, thanks.
[17:38:20] <jennyj> say you have an array of 10 items. How would you create a new array that has items 5-8?
[17:42:16] <tw2113> jennyj, you could try using array_slice()
[17:42:35] <jennyj> tw2113 yeah that should do it, thanks
[17:43:07] <tw2113> $new = array_slice( $myarray, 6, 4 ); without testing
[17:43:19] <tw2113> maybe 5 instead of 6
[17:43:43] <shoky> uhm we're in #jquery btw
[17:44:16] <tw2113> oops
[17:44:37] <tw2113> :D
[17:44:41] <tw2113> hi shoky
[17:44:59] <shoky> heya tw2113 ;]
[19:16:29] <ziikutv> Hey guys the event.preventDefault() is being triggered automatically, how do I stop it from doing that?
[19:30:05] <mdev> intercept and return false
[19:30:42] <mdev> event.stopPropagation();
[19:31:08] <mdev> actually nevermind I don't know, sorry
[19:33:28] <ziikutv> :)
[19:33:41] <ziikutv> mdev: https://discuss.atom.io/t/oauth2-0-integration-fails/18493/2
[19:54:56] <d3m0n> Is it possbile to run a is() function before running the jquery.validation plugin? http://jsfiddle.net/Lgjhaft4/
[19:55:00] <d3m0n> Doesn't seem to like that.
[20:02:09] <d3m0n> Nvm, I got it.
[20:02:23] <d3m0n> It's actually already got a function to check if it's checked
[20:02:38] <d3m0n> required: #checkbox:checked;
[20:39:38] <arc_> okay so i've been told by somebody in here that while loops are generally to be avoided
[20:40:19] <arc_> i'm trying to make a userscript for reddit. i want to show all comments below "load more comments"
[20:40:30] <arc_> but it's possible for another load more comments link to appear below that
[20:40:52] <monk3y> arc_: that's interesting.  I think I've seen some reasoning 'for' that argument before.  Can't you get the finite collection of comments at any one time, then .each through them?
[20:40:53] <arc_> so i need to do it until there are no more load comments links loaded into dom
[20:41:09] <arc_> yeah but i need to loop, because more of those can appear at each step
[20:41:27] <arc_> and they aren't in the dom until you click load
[20:41:56] <arc_> well i need to do something. i don't know if i need to loop
[20:41:56] <monk3y> So even if you're making it appear infinite; could you still load the finite collection until the next 'load more comments', show the current collection, then load the next finite group, until the next 'load more comments'.  Rinse/repeat?
[20:42:27] <arc_> how would you start again from the beginning without a while loop?
[20:42:28] <monk3y> So ultimately it should load everything/at once .. but programmatically it's doing it finite-collection by collection?
[20:42:54] <monk3y> So when you trigger "load more comments", it just opens a new finite set of comments, right?
[20:42:59] <arc_> yeah
[20:43:20] <arc_> all i'm doing with that btw is just clicking the link, it's not firing an event
[20:43:29] <monk3y> Alright; so select all of those, .each() through them and do whatever, then trigger the next 'load more comments', and repeat?
[20:43:42] <arc_> what's the event then?
[20:43:50] <monk3y> Yeah that's what I mean.  .trigger() = programmatically 'clicking' .. right?
[20:43:54] <arc_> yeah
[20:44:08] <arc_> will on click fire if jquery clicked?
[20:44:22] <monk3y> Heh sorry, not completely sure what you're saying/asking there..
[20:44:51] <monk3y> Are you asking 'if' you can trigger an .on('click'.. you've already defined?
[20:45:10] <arc_> yes that's what i was asking, but that's just what i thought of as how to do what you're saying
[20:45:29] <arc_> i don't know how else to rerun the trigger function without a loop
[20:45:46] <arc_> i would normally do while ($('selector'))
[20:45:57] <arc_> if while even exists in jquery
[20:46:07] <arc_> or javascript i mean
[20:46:55] <arc_> i'm sure it does :p
[20:47:38] <monk3y> Alrighty, well excuse my super-pseudo-code, but; see if "load more comments" exists, 'that'.trigger("click"), select all the new comments below where it was, .each through that selection, then test for "load more comments" again.  Until "load more comments" doesn't exist.
[20:48:04] <arc_> how do you test again
[20:48:07] <arc_> that's what i'm asking
[20:48:26] <arc_> the only way i know to do that without an event being triggered is a while loop
[20:48:28] <monk3y> Ok sorry, which bit do you want to know how to 'test'?
[20:49:33] <arc_> ok. i check for '.morecomments' and click them all. now potentially, more '.morecomments' exist in dom, but they didn't before. without just repeating the code, how do i rerun the check for '.morecomments' and click them again
[20:49:52] <arc_> it seems like a while loop is unavoidable
[20:50:06] <monk3y> Ah gotcha.
[20:50:19] <arc_> lol good
[20:50:23] <arc_> i thought i was going crazy for a moment
[20:50:35] <monk3y> Well I just had a quick look on Reddit (and stop me if RES changes any of this), but you're looking for div.morechildren, yeah?
[20:51:18] <arc_> well it's easier to look for .morecomments because it's the link that has to be clicked
[20:51:19] <monk3y> <div class=" thing id-t1_cstfa09 noncollapsed   morechildren " onclick="click_thing(this)" data-fullname="t1_cstfa09">..
[20:51:48] <arc_> but yes, essentially
[20:51:55] <monk3y> Heh sorry; I looked at the <a> but it didn't have anything clear enough - but you mean the span.morecomments around the <a>, correct?
[20:52:01] <arc_> yes
[20:53:12] <monk3y> k.  So I assume your code has gotten comfortably to 'a comment' = div.thing?
[20:53:29] <arc_> yeah
[20:53:46] <monk3y> Alright.  So you were thinking (while (!span.morecomments))?
[20:54:09] <arc_> it should be while($('.morecomments)) while they exist, not while they don't exist
[20:54:20] <monk3y> Heh sorry.  Coffee's wearing off.
[20:54:24] <arc_> np :p
[20:55:24] <monk3y> Heh now I'm trying to coin-flip between that and .. recursion.  So write the function to trigger the load-more click, .each the comments, then at the end of that function; if (span.morechildren) { call itself; }
[20:55:44] <arc_> ah, yeah
[20:55:56] <arc_> haven't thought about recursion in a while :p
[20:56:01] <monk3y> Again, this is coffee-less n00balizing.  Gotta pick which one's worse eh?
[20:56:51] <monk3y> I'm guessing Reddit doesn't show all of them at once 'cause a comment-tree could be very long.  I'm not sure if/how they set a hard-depth.
[20:57:23] <monk3y> And I'm guessing you can't 'ask' it because it's really a case of clicking and traversing it physically to find out.
[20:57:34] <arc_> yeah. this is for a specific subreddit though that's not that big, so it shouldn't be a huge problem
[20:57:40] <monk3y> Mmk.
[20:58:48] <arc_> reddit doesn't seem to like this
[20:59:02] <arc_> it loads the first comment, but the rest of them just sit there saying "loading..." forever
[20:59:16] <arc_> sounds like built in throttling
[20:59:32] <arc_> when i manually click the "loading..." text it works
[21:06:00] <monk3y> arc_: hmm .. not sure if you searched for this, but someone asked for it; https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/dmb8q/hey_reddit_can_we_get_a_single_button_to_load_all/c11a2cp
[21:06:41] <monk3y> arc_: that's a part of the thread, then this is a specific reply a few comments under that; https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/dmb8q/hey_reddit_can_we_get_a_single_button_to_load_all/c11dhcl
[21:08:14] <arc_> yeah. i think they are preventing that from working
[21:08:29] <arc_> it loads the first comment, and the rest do nothing.
[21:08:54] <arc_> i even tried to set a delay, and that prevents EVERYTHING from working, like it doesn't work if the hardware click event didn't fire at the same time as attempting to click the link
[21:09:27] <arc_> i don't know if that's even possible in a web browser, but that's what the behavior seems like to me
[21:12:06] <arc_> so i guess this is impossible. oh well
[21:12:10] <arc_> thanks for your help
[21:13:24] <arc_> i guess i will just have to show what is visible when you initially load the page, and if it's a hidden comment, there's nothing i can do
[21:15:35] <d3m0n> Mmm new problem. I can't seem to use require_form_group AND require together with jquery validate. I need to make sure a specific radio button is checked and either or input can be filled.
[21:18:19] <arc_> is it possible to do something like ... if (somevalue == any of the values in an array)
[21:19:01] <shoky> arc_: if (array.indexOf(somevalue) !== -1)
[21:19:07] <arc_> ty
[21:24:19] <monk3y> arc_: sorry for going awol.  Yeah it looks like they might be blocking you.  I tried to check the event-handlers registered (using Chrome), but couldn't see anything specific .. although their stuff is minified and hard to read.  They could be checking for soft-triggered clicks and 'preventing default'.  I have 0.001 x clue.
[21:25:12] <monk3y> According to those comments I pasted before, you might have the ability in Reddit 'Gold', so *shrug*.  .. make a script to crack Reddit and give the user gold?  Heh.
[21:25:31] <arc_> fyi you can unminify in chrome inspector by clicking the button that looks like {} at the bottom left
[21:26:01] <hwamokp66>  http://www.paintersgta.ca/   I'm trying to get my navigation to work without the .html extension but the code I've added to my .htaccess isn't doing anything. http://pastebin.com/Eew5Wr9k
[21:26:04] <arc_> unless it's in the html of course :p
[21:26:10] <arc_> shoky does that work with strings?
[21:26:21] <arc_> or anyone, if you know
[21:26:35] <shoky> arc_ yep
[21:26:50] <arc_> ty
[21:40:21] <arc_> this doesn't seem to be doing anything. i get no errors so it's kind of hard to debug
[21:40:30] <arc_> $(this).closest('.thing').parent().prepend($(this).closest('.thing'));
[21:40:41] <arc_> $(this).closest('.thing') does return what i expect
[21:40:51] <arc_> i guess maybe the parent isn't what i think it is
[21:41:14] <arc_> yeah it's not, ok
[21:41:35] <arc_> nevermind
[21:55:22] <arc_> k, i got this working as well as it's going to. thanks for your help
[23:03:30] <arc_> well, my script won't work on firefox. as far as i can tell, it's because reddit is loading its own jquery, and greasemonkey refuses to load the one i specified
[23:03:36] <arc_> and the old jquery doesn't support the methods i am using
[23:03:43] <arc_> does this sound plausible?
[23:11:34] <simonfunk2> good morning
[23:19:56] <arc_> ok, i'm getting somewhere
[23:20:15] <arc_> but this doesn't seem to evaluate to true in firefox
[23:20:16] <arc_> if (GGGEmployees.indexOf($(this).html()) !== -1) {
[23:20:30] <arc_> i guess maybe the html is rendering differently
[23:20:34] <arc_> i'll check that
[23:21:10] <Cork> uh...
[23:21:26] <Cork> what is GGGEmployees?
[23:21:30] <arc_> an array of strings
[23:21:47] <Cork> and what exactly do you get from html()?
[23:21:54] <arc_> a string which is a reddit username
[23:22:16] <Cork> well you need to be more specific
[23:25:39] <arc_> sorry, let me look at this for another minute before i ask again
[23:25:59] <arc_> and no i don't expect you to wait for me ;)
[23:27:28] <arc_> nevermind. the page changed while i was testing, and the element i was working on disappeared from dom
[23:27:33] <arc_> the dangers of working on userscripts
[23:27:41] <arc_> sorry to bother
[23:28:13] <Cork> arc_: a side note, you should try using the jquery version in the page instead of overloading it
[23:28:27] <Cork> loading two versions of jquery in a page has quite a few risks
[23:29:13] <arc_> how can i find out what methods a previous version of jquery supports
[23:29:33] <Cork> api.jquery.com
[23:29:54] <Cork> but most of them work in all versions
[23:30:12] <Cork> the simple rule is to use .bind/.delegate instead of .on for example
[23:30:24] <Cork> and you will have support for 1.5+
[23:30:34] <arc_> reddit has 1.7.1. is that good for .on?
[23:30:40] <Cork> no
[23:30:46] <arc_> okay, that's probably why it wasn't working then
[23:30:47] <arc_> thanks
[23:30:48] <Cork> on landed in 1.7 if i remember correctly
[23:31:02] <arc_> isn't 1.7.1 after 1.7
[23:31:04] <Cork> ah, sorry
[23:31:11] <Cork> ya, on landed in 1.7
[23:31:13] <arc_> okay
[23:31:36] <Cork> lol i said right but it wasn't what i meant to type XD
[23:31:42] <Cork> i MEANT to say 1.9 >_<
[23:31:55] <Cork> but ya, it landed in 1.7, so it should work fine
[23:32:03] <arc_> lol
[23:32:40] <arc_> okay, i think it actually worked on firefox the whole time, but it was just that the stupid page changed out from under me -_-
[23:32:52] <arc_> without jquery 2.1.1
[23:33:14] <Cork> ya, not much new functionality landed since 1.9
[23:33:16] <Cork> ...
[23:33:18] <Cork> 1.7!
[23:33:20] <arc_> haha
[23:33:37] <Cork> 1.9+ and 2.x is mostly bugfixes and removal of old deprecated functions
[23:33:58] <Cork> (2.x is the same as 1.9+ but with ie<9 support removed)
[23:34:52] <arc_> i see
[23:35:29] <arc_> how's it looking as far as having to add support for edge? is there much work to be done there?
[23:35:54] <Cork> it's ongoing, but no not as far as i've heard
[23:36:06] <arc_> cool
[23:36:10] <Cork> what jquery need to add is bug fixes
[23:36:22] <Cork> and the biggest area of bugs now days is webkit
[23:36:30] <Cork> especially safari
[23:36:52] <Cork> well workarounds for bugs, not really bugfixes :)
[23:37:00] <arc_> i'm surprised to hear that honestly. i would think safari being so vanilla, they would have focused all their work on making it compatible
[23:37:18] <Cork> they aren't focusing on anything actually
[23:37:27] <Cork> they want ppl to use apps instead
[23:37:44] <arc_> oh safari mobile?
[23:37:49] <Cork> (sounds like microsoft and ie6 back in the days)
[23:37:57] <Cork> and osx
[23:38:11] <pokergod> I created an input file, when I upload the file...   subsequent checks for  #file.val() is empty,  anyone know why?
[23:38:25] <arc_> lol. i don't know how good of a business plan it will be for apple to let the internet go by the wayside
[23:38:51] <arc_> but i guess safari probably works good enough for them
[23:38:57] <Cork> arc_: they have a choke hold on there entire userbase
[23:39:08] <arc_> yeah, tell me about it : /
[23:39:08] <Cork> they don't care
[23:39:31] <Cork> pokergod: file.val() isn't ever useful for inputs of type file
[23:40:11] <Kartagis> hi
[23:41:08] <Kartagis> I've been using ajax to query a list of content from my server, but it takes too long (14secs). anyway I can optimise that?
[23:41:22] <deepy> profile it
[23:41:32] <deepy> is the actual call taking 14 seconds?
[23:41:42] <Cork> Kartagis: check in the server log to identify how long it takes the server to generate the response
[23:42:07] <Kartagis> Cork: I've got no access to server log
[23:42:27] <Cork> Kartagis: well then you would have to ask someone to do it that has access
[23:42:39] <Kartagis> uhm, okay
[23:42:49] <Cork> one thing you can do is open the browsers network tab
[23:42:58] <Cork> and check how long the raw network call takes
[23:43:13] <Cork> if that is the majority of the time the problem is server side
[23:43:27] <Cork> if it isn't then you most likely have problems in your js code processing the response
[23:43:38] <Cork> (and that is most likely excessive reflows)
[23:45:16] <Kartagis> uhm
[23:45:29] <Kartagis> it might have been my internet
[23:45:49] <Kartagis> I turned off wifi on my phone, and it took 4secs
[23:45:54] <Kartagis> still long
[23:46:06] <Cork> O_o
[23:46:11] <Cork> your developing on your phone??
[23:46:23] <Kartagis> it's a phonegap app
[23:46:37] <Kartagis> but it's using jquery
[23:46:38] <Cork> been lucky enough to never had to do thqat
[23:46:46] <Cork> *that
[23:46:47] <Kartagis> why?
[23:47:17] <Kartagis> I mean why do you say that?
[23:47:54] <Cork> cause phonegap is a "i don't want to pick a fitting language" crutch
[23:48:13] <Cork> so you get all kind of problems
[23:48:38] <Kartagis> it saves you from having to learn 3 different languages imo
[23:48:58] <Uhkis> are those 3 languages html, javascript and css? :D
[23:48:58] <Cork> ya, like i said
[23:49:31] <arc_> now i gotta look up what phonegap is
[23:49:35] <Kartagis> Uhkis: no, objective-c, java, and c#
[23:49:44] <Cork> i've never been much of fit the task to works with the language kind of guy
[23:50:03] <Cork> i prefer to pick the best language or the job and just use that
[23:50:37] <arc_> "Develop locally then see the changes instantly on your mobile device with our cross-platform app" can't you do that anyway now
[23:50:43] <Kartagis> how do you know what the best language for the job is?
[23:51:00] <Cork> the one meant for the job
[23:51:17] <Cork> languages all have a target work area
