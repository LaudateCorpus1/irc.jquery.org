[02:16:47] <inthl> I am using window.history.pushState to add to the history after something happened that changes text on the page - using window.history.pushState({page: foobar}, 'title', './?' + foobar); ... now this works fine I think, as window.history.state does contain page:foobar
[02:17:05] <inthl> now when using $(window).on('popstate', function(event) { to detect e.g. a back button press, event.originalEvent.page is undefined
[02:17:37] <inthl> I am pretty much sure that this kinda worked before, now it doesn't and I can figure out for ages why this is not working any more. any ideas why .page would be undefined?
[02:18:00] <dw1> the first 2 arguments are useless i think
[02:18:30] <dw1> the first 2 arguments are useless i think
[02:18:34] <inthl> dw1 sry, connection dropped
[02:18:55] <dw1> just parse the location.pathname on pop
[02:19:05] <inthl> which 2 arguments? the ones of pushState may be ignored, but it's the last 2 not the first 2
[02:19:36] <dw1> the 3rd is the url so you need that
[02:19:39] <dw1> i just leave the first 2 blank
[02:19:42] <dw1> i read they arent used (yet)
[02:20:14] <inthl> location.pathname does not contain what I used to push using pushState - I need exactly that value
[02:20:28] <dw1> use a hash or something then
[02:20:50] <dw1> if pathname wont work
[02:21:55] <inthl> well I'd rather not use a hash due to possible conflicts with existing code - I just wonder why this does not work any more, hence why .page would be undefined. this code worked a few days before, I have no idea why it does not any more. also lots of tutorials suggest exactly this approach - so I just wonder why .state may be undefined.
[02:23:19] <dw1> oh apparently it was title that is useless https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState
[02:23:26] <inthl> welp :>
[02:25:00] <dw1> are you sure you're not returning to a page that didnt have a state pushed
[02:25:16] <dw1> hmm
[02:25:38] <inthl> uhm
[02:25:49] <dw1> "Chrome and Firefox treat that popstate event differently. While Firefox doesn't fire it up on the first load, Chrome does."
[02:26:02] <inthl> both crome and firefox show it as undefined

[02:27:53] <dw1> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[02:28:32] <inthl> the only content event.originalstate has is {"isTrusted":true}
[02:30:23] <dw1> i just always modify the url so everything works the same on page refresh
[02:32:53] <inthl> well my idea was to modify just the ./?thispart - there are several reasons to do that, I mean why this choice is smarter in my case. I guess I'll have to revert to the older code and look up step by step since when it went south
[02:33:59] <dw1> if you change the url, query vars, or hash you dont need the state argument
[02:34:03] <dw1> you can just parse the location
[02:35:48] <inthl> hm
[02:36:22] <inthl> well I am mixing actual data from GET requests and 'ajax' calls from local files, in some webview app. so that history state seemed like a better approach
[02:36:41] <dw1> yeah maybe

[09:18:44] <lewphole> anyone used the photo/video lightbox.js on github? I'm having trouble getting my videos to play. they show up but when I click on one it doesn't play. it just looks like a static image
