[02:54:43] <hellyeah> what is the method in jquery for textContent
[03:01:12] <KoMan> ??
[03:03:07] <hellyeah> var $option = $('<option>');  $option.text(value); $option.val(key); $option.appendTo($('.seconddropdown'));
[03:03:10] <hellyeah> that worked
[03:03:47] <hellyeah> $('<option>').text(key).value(value).appendTo($('.seconddropdown'));
[03:03:51] <hellyeah> not worked
[03:03:55] <hellyeah> i dont know why
[03:05:23] <alaing> hellyeah: try $('<option>').text(key).val(value).appendTo($('.seconddropdown'));
[03:06:03] <hellyeah> damn
[03:06:10] <hellyeah> i wrote value
[03:06:11] <hellyeah> :p
[03:06:17] <alaing> lol
[03:06:21] <hellyeah> but it gave error to text also
[03:06:24] <hellyeah> let me try
[03:06:42] <hellyeah> this is morning
[03:06:46] <hellyeah> and i am little dizzt
[03:06:49] <hellyeah> dizzy
[03:06:56] <alaing> easily done
[03:08:00] <arc_> in the first thing you wrote text(value) and in the second you wrote text(key)
[03:08:15] <arc_> in the first thing you wrote val(key) and in the second thing you wrote val(value)
[03:08:41] <arc_> so make sure you are passing the correct variables

[04:57:25] <DFar> Hi all !
[05:00:10] <Sourcey> Hello. Im adjust height of a div with animate()., but I want to do this without moving the below text down - Need to keep it in the same place. How to fix this?
[05:04:06] <DFar>  is anybody have an example of form with sub-form displayed by checkbox, rendering like a listview ?
[05:06:06] <DFar> @Sourcey : Have you tried with a css position : relative at the text below ?
[05:08:30] <Sourcey> DFar: nope, i will try this
[05:13:50] <Cork> Sourcey: simplest is to wrap the element in an additional element and have it the full size of the inner elemnt
[05:13:59] <Cork> and then just animate the element inside it
[05:15:09] <Sourcey> ah yes
[05:16:13] <Sourcey> Worked nicely, thanks
[05:25:51] <alaing> Morning Cork
[05:26:19] <alaing> so i'm trying to create my own plugin using jquery ui widget factory. it needs to inherit everything from the autocomplete widget
[05:26:33] <alaing> I've got this $.widget('my.autocomplete', $.ui.autocomplete,
[05:26:44] <alaing> and have a _create method. how do I call ui.autocomplete on the element I'm working on?
[05:28:20] <Cork> alaing: $.ui.autocomplete.prototype._create.apply(this, arguments);
[05:29:22] <alaing> this being the next element i created? arguments being the options I want to pass to ui.autocomplete?
[05:29:56] <alaing> ^ next element = new element
[05:30:10] <alaing> Cork: ^
[05:30:28] <Cork> alaing: no
[05:30:56] <Cork> in the plugins _create function you call that to include the overloaded widgets create function
[05:31:25] <Cork> you normally don't need to do this unless you need to do additional stuff on create
[05:31:54] <alaing> Cork: ah so in my.autocomplete._create function i call that statement
[05:32:05] <alaing> and that would use the original ui.autocomplete
[05:32:11] <Cork> ya
[05:32:17] <alaing> cool
[05:32:31] <alaing> yes i am adding stuff on create
[05:33:36] <alaing> I have a select list and I'm injecting a input field next to it. I'm then hiding the select list and using it as a source for autocomplete
[05:35:20] <alaing> Cork: thanks for your help :-)
[05:35:27] <Cork> np
[05:36:12] <alaing> Cork: do you mind if I pm you?

[05:39:11] <Lebby1> Hi, I have a question: I'm building a widget using widget factory; Now this widget is a composition of other widget so i.i: BigWidget contains instance of smallwidget1 smallwidget2 ... etc
[05:39:11] <Lebby1> When i do :var bg= $("<div>").BigWidget();
[05:39:15] <Cork> alaing: i'm at work so don't really have time right now
[05:40:09] <alaing> Cork: np understandable. just thanks for being here
[05:40:22] <Lebby1> it returns a jquery element ( as axpected ) ... is there a way to have an extended jquery element with attached method like myCustomMethod?
[05:40:50] <alaing> Lebby1: do you have a jsfiddle/jsbin/codepen example?
[05:41:00] <Lebby1> no
[05:41:30] <alaing> Lebby1: could you?
[05:41:53] <Lebby1> if you want i'll do, but the question is pretty simple, but i can't figure out
[05:42:39] <Lebby1> i want to do bg.myCustomMethod() instead to assign it to the data("namespace.widgetName") and then call it ...
[05:43:30] <Lebby1> Link is also accepted, i can study them :)
[05:51:18] <yd4b> hi i have a fieldset with a form in it, in this i also have a textarea and 2 input boxes for amount and price. I also want to create a buttons which gives a sort of popup with a sorted list of items for example +battery -bat 1 -bat 2 if i select this item then it must put it in to the textarea, anyone any idea how to get this easily done?
[06:00:57] <Kev> I have a button (toggle) which, when clicked is to run a few background scripts. is .load option I should use?
[06:01:36] <alaing> Kev, background scripts?
[06:02:20] <alaing> Kev-: do you mean it does an ajax call to your server?
[06:02:24] <Kev> alaing: connects to database with php and inserts a row, and starts a session
[06:02:34] <Kev> alaing: yes
[06:02:54] <Kev> just wondering if I should be using .load to do it
[06:03:06] <alaing> Kev-: do you want to give feed back to the user?
[06:03:25] <alaing> Kev-: could just use .ajax
[06:03:44] <Kev> ok, .ajax it is
[06:04:28] <alaing> Kev-: .load is more for when you want to grab a bit of html from the server and inject it into the page
[06:05:01] <alaing> Kev-: you might want to lookup "Promises" if you need to run other things or do something with the outcomes
[06:05:59] <Duikb00t> What's the best way to check if a certain div is rendered?
[06:06:13] <Duikb00t> Checking on :visible?
[06:06:50] <alaing> Duikb00t: $('div').length > 0
[06:06:58] <Duikb00t> ok :)
[06:07:00] <Duikb00t> Thx
[06:07:24] <alaing> Duikb00t: :visible will only tell you if the element is displaying to the user or not but it might be in the dom (i.e rendered)
[06:09:08] <DFar> I want to check automatically check previous checkbox but something doesn't work .... https://jsfiddle.net/u3uotq5g/  Any idea ?
[06:11:17] <Duikb00t> Seems not yet to be working. I only want to show http://kopy.io/yJXRX
[06:11:32] <Duikb00t> * I only want to toggle if the div is rendered
[06:12:37] <alaing> DFar: i'm looking at it now
[06:12:55] <alaing> firstly you can use .closest() instead of .parents()
[06:13:12] <alaing> Duikb00t: ^
[06:13:52] <Duikb00t> alaing:  I think you want to mention > DFar
[06:15:25] <DFar> alaing: I have several [.Livre controlgroup], I'm afraid unexpected behavior with .closest ?
[06:15:43] <DFar> .LivrControlGroup *
[06:15:54] <alaing> Duikb00t: thanks :-) do you have any markup ?
[06:16:07] <alaing> Dfar give me a sec
[06:16:32] <Lebby1> alaing: https://jsfiddle.net/eyg23pu7/2/ This is the logical snippets demanded
[06:16:42] <alaing> DFar: any particular reason why you want to trigger a click?
[06:17:04] <alaing> DFar: is it just to check the checkbox? there are better ways of doing that
[06:17:47] <DFar> i just want to check the checkbox / / Ok, i listen
[06:19:59] <Duikb00t> Fixed it thanks it was more a php issue about rendering the div
[06:20:01] <Duikb00t> @if (count($errors) > 0) ;)
[06:20:20] <Kev> alaing: I am looking at  https://api.jquery.com/promise/ and I still dont know what .promise does

[06:29:46] <DFar> alaing: Thank you, indeed why I did not use .prop() .... Thank you again, It will save me a coffee.
[06:30:35] <alaing> DFar: no problem, i didn't realise you were using jQuery mobile and that it had a .refresh method so i learnt somethign too :-)

[06:33:33] <Lebby1> alaing: no one, it works, but i want to have a jquery object plus my custom methods, instead of every time retrieve data and call them ... i have needs to have a simple manageable object, to simply call  methods and wrap and wrap and wrap again ... A i want a cleaner a fastest way to do that ... is it so unreasonable?

[06:54:32] <mousa> Hi what is the difference between var toto = "..." and $toto = "..." ?
[06:56:43] <Lebby1> mousa:  only the name ... but ... if you do toto = "Something" and $toto =$("Something"), difference is: toto is an object or Something, $toto is a wrapped jQuery Object of "Something" ... it is only a convetion put "$" before a variable name ...
[06:57:41] <mousa> it is also used to have global variables in the function ?
[06:58:01] <mousa> $increment = 0; then $increment++;
[06:59:20] <Lebby1> mousa: I don't know this name convetion, but it could be ... generally is used to explicit about global ... like window.increment ( window is the global context )
[06:59:48] <shoky> mousa  $ in a variable name is just a character like any other, it has no special meaning,  don't use it in all variables, possibly only for jquery objects.  not putting `var` in front makes a variable be global/outer scoped
[07:01:49] <mousa> thank you :)
[07:18:03] <lalalaaa> Hi!

[08:42:54] <VectorX> hi this ticker is supposed to be on a single line but the last item wraps to a new line, can someone tell me how i can fix it https://jsfiddle.net/x1j95djy/ ?
[08:59:21] <Cork> VectorX: doesn't wrap here
[08:59:28] <fadex> hi can you help my me ? my click function only run once  : https://jsfiddle.net/zerzerezrzegggg/oq54kL9p/2/
[08:59:54] <Cork> VectorX: also i would recommend looking at using css3 animation instead of moving the elements with js
[09:00:09] <Cork> much less resource hungry (and less jumpy)
[09:00:59] <VectorX> cork yeah i did a css3 version but had some issues with it, so was trying to get this working, the main problem was when you added more li's
[09:01:31] <Cork> fadex: https://jsfiddle.net/oq54kL9p/3/
[09:02:29] <VectorX> http://i68.tinypic.com/2zh33o9.png
[09:02:35] <fadex> Cork thank you
[09:02:43] <fadex> what is the difference between on click and click ?
[09:02:55] <VectorX> thats how it wraps, Cork not sure if it will do it if you resize the view pane and run
[09:04:12] <Cork> fadex: https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[09:04:32] <fadex> thx
[09:04:44] <Cork> VectorX: i don't see that here...
[09:04:57] <Cork> but it sounds like the area you give for the lis is too small
[09:05:18] <Cork> VectorX: an option could be to make the lis display: inline-block; instead of float
[09:05:27] <Cork> and then set white-space: nowrap;
[09:05:33] <VectorX> ill try that
[09:05:57] <Cork> note that you can't have indentations around the lis if you use that solution
[09:06:10] <Cork> (space is visible in inline elements)
[09:06:30] <Cork> html comments is a hack you can use to get around that
[09:15:02] <VectorX> gotta run thanks again Cork

[09:16:20] <decx> should've used marquee
[09:23:17] <DFar> Hi all
[09:24:15] <Cork> decx: heh, marquee has been removed from browser support
[09:25:19] <decx> Cork: it's a joke
[09:25:30] <Cork> decx: i got that ^^'
[09:25:32] <decx> but til
[09:25:36] <decx> didnt even realize
[09:25:45] <decx> that it's gone for good
[09:26:53] <Cork> was quite a big noise about it when firefox removed support
[09:28:54] <DFar> I'm looking for a way to display terms and conditions on a mobile website, any idea ?
[09:29:18] <decx> i'd use paragraphs and headlines :p
[09:29:24] <Cork> DFar: a link in the footer?
[09:29:41] <DFar> Cork: After a checkbox in form
[09:29:56] <DFar> and insidea form in jquery mobile
[09:29:56] <Cork> ok so a link after the checkbox
[09:30:43] <Cork> decx: opps sorry i mixed it up with <blink>
[09:30:58] <Cork> marquee is still supported, though they changed how it works a bit
[09:31:17] <decx> not blink!
[09:31:21] <DFar> But i'm not sure 'fancybox' is a good way to display it
[09:31:44] <decx> doesn jqm has its own modal
[09:39:26] <DFar> decx: indeed, why i don't use it ...
[09:46:52] <jstroem> nocontrol: this is your problem. The form creates a child $scope and thats where your update_data is going, so once you make $scope.update_data = '' you are setting the value on the parent $scope object but on its children. Therefore i suggested to make a new object $scope.data = {} and then use that for your updates.
[10:18:11] <x342> I don't understand why ".is" not working
[10:18:12] <x342>    if($("input").is(".valid, .error, :focus")){
[10:18:43] <Cork> x342: i don't think you can use multiple selectors with is
[10:18:53] <Cork> if i remember correctly
[10:19:38] <Cork> x342: also note that that line checks all inputs in the page
[10:19:57] <x342> Stackexchange search shows it used to. Even single one of them is not working. just like .hasClass. Classes are added with jQuery too.
[10:20:01] <Cork> (would be good with an example of the problem => jsfiddle.net)
[10:20:55] <decx> still works
[10:31:24] <x342> here is approximately what I want to achieve https://jsfiddle.net/fee7bgwL/
[10:31:44] <ij888> Boom!
[10:33:16] <taplar> x342: i'm thinking your wanting filter
[10:33:26] <taplar> your 'this' is not what you think it is in that test
[10:34:26] <taplar> and your misusing closest
[10:36:11] <x342> I never got far enough to see (this).closest work. it was (".label-float").css.. all the time I was testing today. I wanted to do that in CSS only, but it is impossible to select previously mentioned element, that's why I have to struggle understanding jQuery
[10:36:28] <x342> I inserted this.closest to demonstrate my wish
[10:36:45] <taplar> something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/fee7bgwL/4/
[10:36:57] <x342> but it never gets past $("input").is("this, that, else");
[10:37:43] <taplar> oh, and label float is not a parent
[10:37:52] <taplar> closest looks for parents that match
[10:37:53] <x342> taplar, yes, but label-float still is at opacity: 0
[10:38:04] <x342> the only thing that is still not working
[10:38:51] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/fee7bgwL/5/
[10:40:11] <taplar> and i'd think you could do that with css
[10:40:38] <taplar> with the exception of the :focus clause maybe
[10:40:54] <taplar> you could ask ##css
[10:43:37] <x342> taplar, opacity still is 0 despite :focus. The problem is that label-float is before input. In CSS there is no way to select an element that comes before one responsible for the change. Im doing css for 10 years now and jquery is something I picked up for this project to step up my game/struggle with opacity:0
[10:44:36] <taplar> can you not do .label-float + .input-suffix.valid { ...blah... }
[10:46:15] <x342> that will affect input-suffix:valid, not the .label-float. JS is easiest way to affect .label-float in this situation
[10:46:22] <taplar> ah
[10:51:21] <taplar> so you said 0 despite :focus.  i added valid and error to the fields and they worked.  what are you expecting with the use of :focus?
[10:54:02] <x342> I expect .label-float to .css("opacity", "1"); on :focus, .valid, .error and am not sure why it is not working for me
[10:55:21] <taplar> you mean when those elements get those classes?  or when one is foused?
[10:55:25] <taplar> *focused
[10:56:23] <x342> when those elements are focused or get those classes, yes, .label:float should be opacity:1
[10:56:45] <x342> when those elements are focused or get those classes, yes, .label-float should be opacity:1
[10:56:57] <taplar> then your going to want an event handler for the focus to do that, and whatever logic adds/removes those classes will need to do that logic
[10:57:26] <taplar> that logic as you have it only executes once, and evaluates on the state of the elements at that point in time
[10:57:55] <x342> when those elements are focused or get those classes, yes, .label-float should be opacity:1
[10:58:13] <taplar> yeah, so you'd have to write that
[10:58:29] <x342> can you guide me to the right path so that it listens continuously like NSA?
[10:58:37] <x342> sorry for dupe, misclicked
[10:59:08] <taplar> check this guy out: http://learn.jquery.com/events/
[10:59:19] <taplar> in particular your interested in the focus event
[10:59:26] <taplar> and blur
[10:59:51] <ij888_> Help please, I am trying to return the value of the key "Book". Much thanks http://jsbin.com/josuza/edit?html,js,output
[11:00:52] <taplar> x342: as for the .valid and .error, you would just do your opacity logic where ever your logic is putting those classes on or taking them off
[11:01:01] <taplar> there isn't really an event for that type of thing
[11:02:32] <x342> I will then abandon my attempts to make .is work in this case and focus on learning .focus/.blur. Discouraging feeling to waste 9 hours to find you that I was hitting concrete wall.
[11:03:25] <taplar> well, you were kinda on the right track.  the issue you were having with 'is' is that that just returns a boolean.
[11:03:41] <taplar> so even if you get true, you lose context of which ones matched.
[11:06:05] <x342> Thanks a lot. I suppose I understand why it failed now and what to look for tomorrow! :) Have a nice $timeOfTheDay, *!
[11:06:20] <taplar> :)
[11:10:17] <awkwardCough> x342: http://jsbin.com/qubivatico/1/edit?html,js,output
[11:10:34] <awkwardCough> sorry I meant ij888_:
[11:16:17] <ij888_> hey thanks @awkwardCough, it still returns the whole JSON response
[11:17:47] <taplar> what do you mean?
[11:18:10] <awkwardCough> check the console
[11:22:50] <ij888_> Nice one @awkwardCough, thanks a billion. I have spent over 24hours trying to get that to work!
[11:23:10] <taplar> do you understand what your issue was?
[11:23:24] <ij888_> Erm not so far
[11:23:43] <taplar> the load your doing is an ajax call, meaning it's asynchronous
[11:23:54] <ij888_> ok
[11:24:03] <taplar> you were trying to use the result of that call afterwards, however it had not yet returned the result
[11:24:41] <taplar> if you want to use the result of an ajax call, you have to do so in one of it's callback functions which guarantees the data will be available at that point.
[11:25:10] <ij888_> the docs on http://api.jquery.com/load/ says its instantly availaible, though
[11:25:43] <taplar> take a look at the callback function
[11:25:59] <taplar> and "This method is the simplest way to fetch data from the server. It is roughly equivalent to $.get(url, data, success) except that it is a method rather than global function and it has an implicit callback function. "
[11:26:31] <taplar> where did you read 'instantly available' ?
[11:27:00] <ij888_> Description: Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element.
[11:27:21] <taplar> nothing about that says instantly
[11:29:36] <ij888_> mayhaps I interpreted that a bit with too much enthusiasm
[11:30:20] <taplar> :), always read the docs.  don't just jump to examples and copy and paste.  helps to avoid these misunderstandings
[11:32:37] <ij888> Point noted
[11:54:08] <Lebby1> hi, anyone can solve this in jquery widgets? : https://jsfiddle.net/fee7bgwL/5/
[11:54:18] <robertmaxrees> what'
[11:54:23] <robertmaxrees> *what's the problem?
[11:54:29] <robertmaxrees> (try actually asking in the channel ;) )
[11:54:49] <Lebby1> this morning i asked and was demanded a jfiddle :)
[11:55:07] <taplar> thought i already gave you some pointers
[11:55:13] <robertmaxrees> great.  so what do you mean by "solve this"?
[11:55:55] <Lebby1> taplar: i miss it ... i will read all chat log ...
[11:56:52] <taplar> the focus/blur events and the additional logic when valid/error classes are added/removed ?
[11:56:53] <Lebby1> robertmaxrees: i did question in comments to be clear and explicit but i will re ask here ... can you wait so i can read all the log chat to see taplar suggestions?
[11:57:20] <robertmaxrees> sounds like taplar has you covered :)
[11:59:24] <Lebby1> robertmaxrees: no, it seems not
[11:59:40] <taplar> what's the problem?
[11:59:41] <Lebby1> taplar: i didn't find you answer
[11:59:55] <Lebby1> the only answer gaved to me was alaing: Lebby1: I kind of feel like this with big/small https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUhImV302rA

[11:59:57] <taplar> i'm pointing you to an answer.  not giving you an answer
[12:01:43] <Lebby1> taplar: i think you are confusing me with another one
[12:02:11] <taplar> did you give an incorrect link then?  that's what i'm basing this upon
[12:02:33] <Lebby1> taplar:  i just read all log of this chat ... and there is not reference to me or to my issue
[12:02:57] <Lebby1> https://jsfiddle.net/eyg23pu7/6/
[12:03:13] <Lebby1> taplar: that was right ... i gave a wrong link ... sorry
[12:03:15] <taplar> ok, that's different, :)
[12:03:32] <Lebby1> yes, i was wrong about link :), sorry again
[12:04:04] <Lebby1> my mistake
[12:04:17] <taplar> no prob
[12:04:53] <taplar> so i'm unfamiliar with this.  can you restate your issue?
[12:08:19] <Lebby1> taplar: yes, of course ... I have a BigWidget that use by association other little widgets. I want to have a mechanism to use them by BigWidget avoiding data() call or fn() call in BS fashion way ... I want a jquery object + my custom method. Inside jfiddle, latest istructions is what i want in brief,and what i can currently do,and what i want achieve. ( i want build a plugin similar to DataTable as behaviour )
[12:10:31] <robertmaxrees> hold way up/.
[12:10:38] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to make your own jquery plugin?
[12:10:55] <robertmaxrees> so you can do $('.someSelector').yourCustomMethod()?
[12:11:07] <Lebby1> yes using widget factory
[12:11:18] <Lebby1> there are 3 exampe in the link
[12:11:22] <robertmaxrees> so you wnat to use the jquery ui widget factory.
[12:11:26] <robertmaxrees> what's your question there then?
[12:11:27] <Lebby1> yes
[12:12:23] <robertmaxrees> 'i mean, you have .132) Quit (Quit: My Mac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)

[12:12:29] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/
[12:12:33] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[12:13:16] <Lebby1> i want to perform: $(selector).BigWidget().littleWidgetInstace.customMethod() and $(selector).BigWidget().customMethodX(), with $(selector).BigWidget() as jQuery "extended" object
[12:13:17] <robertmaxrees> there's also http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/widget-factory/
[12:13:29] <Lebby1> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/eyg23pu7/6/ ... -.-
[12:13:52] <robertmaxrees> Lebby1 then BitWidget needs to return an object with those methods/properties on it.
[12:13:58] <Lebby1> i think that code is more explicative
[12:13:58] <robertmaxrees> *BigWidget
[12:14:07] <robertmaxrees> i disagree.
[12:14:16] <robertmaxrees> i think that's much more confusing, but feel free to do it ;)
[12:15:15] <robertmaxrees> you can return whatever you want out of a method, either way.
[12:15:15] <Lebby1> robertmaxrees:  ok, how i can return a jQuery object with those methods/properties on it?
[12:15:33] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to extend jquery with those methods/properties.
[12:15:37] <robertmaxrees> and then return a jquery object.
[12:16:21] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'll need to tack them on yourself every time - var $myReturnObject = $(this); $myReturnObject.someCustomProp = 'foo'; return $myReturnObject;
[12:16:28] <Lebby1> robertmaxrees: using _create?  _init?  _otherMethod?
[12:16:34] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid doing it that way and just extend the jquery object.
[12:16:40] <robertmaxrees> you're using the widget factory.
[12:16:43] <Lebby1> yes
[12:16:43] <robertmaxrees> that's what it does./
[12:16:46] <robertmaxrees> you handle it there.
[12:16:53] <robertmaxrees> you're going to have to extend it multiple times.
[12:16:57] <robertmaxrees> you're adding multiple methods.
[12:18:28] <Lebby1> so ... i can't do using $.widget() ... but i must do outside ... is it right?
[12:18:33] <robertmaxrees> you can.
[12:18:44] <robertmaxrees> but you're going to need to make multiple calls to $.widget()
[12:18:52] <robertmaxrees> one for every method you're adding.
[12:20:21] <Lebby1> so i must add a widgetName for each method?
[12:20:51] <robertmaxrees> yes.  you will cann $.widget() once for every method you're going to attach to the jquery object.
[12:21:12] <robertmaxrees> if you really want to return full jquery objects for each, that is.
[12:22:48] <Lebby1> but this will add a method to the global jQuery ... and not a structured extended jQuery Object ...
[12:23:10] <Lebby1> Maybe i simply don't understand what you mean ...
[12:23:12] <robertmaxrees> based on the end result you want, that's how you do it.
[12:23:29] <robertmaxrees> no, you're getting it.
[12:24:28] <robertmaxrees> you need to globally extend jquery or manually add properties to returned jquery objects.  the former would be the "preferred" way of doing it, the latter is going to become fragile pretty quickly.
[12:24:40] <robertmaxrees> you're basically looking to piggyback on jquery for something it's really not meant to do.
[12:27:08] <Lebby1> Maybe, I wasn't clear ... I don't want $(selector).widget1() $(selector).widget2() ... etc. but $(selector).BigWidget() => returns (as expected normal jQuery Object ), but i want a jQuery Object + methods ... So i have to manually  inject methods and properties ... but to use them i must use .data("namespace-widgetName") ... DataTables instead return a jQuery Object + its custom method without use of .data(namespaceX-datatables) ...
[12:27:29] <robertmaxrees> i just explained how to do that.
[12:27:44] <Lebby1> thank you ..
[12:28:00] <robertmaxrees> you either extend the global jquery object or manually add properties and methods to the jquery object you return out of your methods.  the former is the "preferred" way to do that, the latter is much more fragile.
[12:28:07] <robertmaxrees> but this whole setup seems awfully silly.
[12:32:22] <Lebby1> oh, i don't understand last thing of you suggestions, that i appreciate: manually add property and methods to jQuery Object you return outs ... Currently when i call .Widget(), it returns a normal jQuery object ( as i expected , as documented ) ... if I inject method, they can be used or by .Widget("method") or by .Widget().data(namespace-pluginName).method() ... i want, if it is possible jump the data behaviour, but i understand from your r
[12:32:39] <robertmaxrees> that cut off.
[12:32:59] <robertmaxrees> your API is going to become very confusing very quickly with what you're trying to do.
[12:35:45] <Lebby1>  I don't think ... but it's ok ... thank you anyway ... I have a more little clear vision :)
[12:35:59] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* alright.  good luck.,
[12:36:27] <Lebby1> thank you for your time :)
[12:36:59] <Uhkis> man that's a lot of unnecessary dots
[12:37:03] <Lebby1> ( i really appreciate that, an answer is better to have not )
[12:37:26] <Lebby1> ( *better than ... )
[12:37:48] <robertmaxrees> Lebby1 except you're not going to take any of our advice ;)
[12:42:22] <Lebby1> Not totally true, I know now, that is not possible, or i don't still know how Datatable plugin achieve that ... but i know that it could be done by extending each instance by using $.widget per each method ( that for me is a No Go ) ... it is a possible solution, but i despite that, but before to talk to you, i never thought about that ... it is a way more than i know, that is good :)
[12:42:52] <robertmaxrees> You can always open up the datatables source fwiw.
[12:42:55] <robertmaxrees> see how they do it.
[12:43:09] <robertmaxrees> but I'd argue their API is really confusing, so I'm not sure you really want to emulate that in the first place.
[12:44:46] <garethdaine> Folks, what am I doing wrong here http://kopy.io/Ne9XI
[12:44:55] <Lebby1> they offer only the min ... i didn't find the not .min :/. That is the problem ... I tried by myself before to ask here :)
[12:45:08] <garethdaine> It toggles no matter what
[12:45:12] <robertmaxrees> garethdaine make a fiddle.
[12:45:22] <robertmaxrees> you're all sorts of confused :)
[12:48:46] <taplar> https://cdn.datatables.net/1.10.11/js/jquery.dataTables.js  mmmm, pretty Lebby1
[12:48:56] <Lebby1> taplar: THANK YOU!
[12:49:06] <robertmaxrees> uh
[12:49:16] <robertmaxrees> Lebby1 that's the datatables source.
[12:49:22] <robertmaxrees> you've had access to that this entire time.
[12:49:26] <taplar> :)
[12:50:12] <taplar> fwiw, you said you couldn't find it.  all i did was take off the .min in the url.  usually they are in the same directory if they both exist
[12:50:22] <robertmaxrees> also: github.
[12:50:34] <Lebby1> yes ... i'm just analyzing that ... so I can try to understand ( i hope to understand it :) )
[12:50:36] <taplar> yeah i was looking for a github link, but found that first
[12:50:37] <garethdaine> robertmaxrees: Here’s the fiddle mate https://jsfiddle.net/o7wz5kmm/3/
[12:51:01] <robertmaxrees> so garethdaine open your console.
[12:51:05] <garethdaine> Ah
[12:51:06] <robertmaxrees> what's the first thing you see?
[12:51:08] <garethdaine> I know why
[12:51:14] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you implement an event handler.
[12:51:20] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:51:29] <robertmaxrees> you need to separate the handler from the widget.
[12:52:38] <garethdaine> Nah, thought I knew why, but no
[12:52:47] <garethdaine> What where you goign to say robertmaxrees?
[12:53:30] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating an event handler with a widget.
[12:53:37] <robertmaxrees> see the error in your console?
[12:55:43] <garethdaine> That’s fiddle specific that, doesn;t do that on my site
[12:55:56] <garethdaine> Everythign is referenced fine
[12:55:58] <robertmaxrees> no it's not.
[12:56:04] <robertmaxrees> event does not exist in that scope.
[12:56:14] <robertmaxrees> there is no available event object inside the widget.
[12:56:19] <garethdaine> Oh yeah, sorry event
[12:56:42] <garethdaine> It didn;t show that evrror in fiddle when I opened console
[12:56:55] <garethdaine> Neither does it show it in the console on my site
[12:57:06] <robertmaxrees> right, you need to click the button first.
[12:57:23] <Lebby1> taplar: robertmaxrees: thank you guys! :)
[12:57:26] <robertmaxrees> then it will show you the error.
[12:57:57] <garethdaine> Still doesn’t show mate, the only thing it shows is jQuery not defined and $ not defined
[12:58:07] <garethdaine> I have included jQuery as a requirement
[12:58:10] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[12:58:15] <robertmaxrees> on your site?
[12:58:17] <robertmaxrees> oor...?
[12:58:28] <robertmaxrees> because i'm getting "event is not defined" inside the fiddle when i click the button.
[12:58:38] <garethdaine> No errors at all on my site, and those above in fiddle
[12:58:47] <robertmaxrees> uh
[12:58:51] <robertmaxrees> okay, well, event is your issue.
[12:58:54] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't exist inside that scope.
[12:59:19] <garethdaine> Ah see that now yes, thank you. How do I stop propagation within the widget?
[12:59:27] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:59:33] <taplar> why would you?
[12:59:40] <robertmaxrees> you pass it manually, but that doesn't make sense.
[12:59:54] <taplar> separate your concerns man
[12:59:56] <garethdaine> I’m no expert guys, so just return and it’s fine
[13:00:02] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:00:05] <robertmaxrees> we're not saying you are?
[13:00:38] <garethdaine> Just taplar saying why would you, well I donlt know, as I’m no expert
[13:00:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:00:56] <robertmaxrees> so you just did it?
[13:01:01] <taplar> ^^^
[13:01:02] <garethdaine> Odd that no error occurred in console, though
[13:01:25] <garethdaine> I stopped propagation initially, because I needed too when I was using the code via an event handler
[13:01:39] <taplar> what about when your not using an event handler?
[13:01:40] <garethdaine> I’ve now made it into a jQuery plugin/widget, so it was simply legacy
[13:02:03] <garethdaine> I had simply missed the fact it was there, fresh eyes and all
[13:02:06] <robertmaxrees> you're confusing how widgets and scope work :)
[13:02:08] <taplar> why does that piece of code need to know anything about an event?
[13:02:17] <robertmaxrees> why not just put the handler in the widget?
[13:02:19] <garethdaine> It doesn't now
[13:03:04] <RedShift> hi all
[13:03:19] <robertmaxrees> hello!
[13:03:54] <skinux> Is it possible to load/use only specific parts of jQuery for certain purposes and use plain JS or another library for other things which jQuery technically does have functionality for?
[13:04:07] <RedShift> on chrome mobile (iPad), when you tap-hold and drag, the browser starts scrolling. I can prevent this using document.body.addEventListener('touchmove', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); }, true);
[13:04:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:04:14] <taplar> skinux: you can always use plain js
[13:04:30] <robertmaxrees> skinux sure, you can always use jsut the parts you want to use.
[13:04:40] <robertmaxrees> skinux are you trying to use those but still call $()?
[13:04:50] <RedShift> the problem is, I have jQuery events that depend on "touchmove", and that gets totally canceled out by document.body.addEventListener('touchmove',...
[13:05:15] <RedShift> so how do I prevent the user being able to scroll, but still propagate touchmove to the elements that need it?
[13:05:28] <RedShift> (the elements in question are HTML5 sliders)
[13:05:40] <skinux> robertmaxxrees: Nah, not trying to do anything right now, was just wondering.
[13:06:28] <taplar> skinux: you can use pretty much anything with anything.  the only concern you have to worry about really is if two of the libraries try to use the same identifier, such as '$'
[13:07:25] <taplar> skinux: as far as loading only parts of jquery core, i'm not sure if that's possible
[13:07:34] <taplar> without changing the file itself
[13:08:38] <taplar> personally i'd shy away from that though, cause if another developer sees you have jquery included on your site they're going to expect all the existing api to be available
[13:24:41] <garethdaine> robertmaxrees: I think I understand what you mean now when you say I’m condusing widgets and scope work, and why not put the handler in the widget, which I’ve done https://jsfiddle.net/o7wz5kmm/6/
[13:25:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's one way to do it.
[13:25:09] <robertmaxrees> just be careful you don't call that method more than once.
[13:25:10] <garethdaine> How would I go about handling a click outside of the element to close (hide) the navigation
[13:25:21] <garethdaine> Ah, OK
[13:25:23] <robertmaxrees> you wouldn't.
[13:25:31] <robertmaxrees> you'd want to target a parent element.
[13:25:32] <garethdaine> Why is that?
[13:25:44] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you COULD target a parent element and bind to that, but that requires a lot of mental overhead.
[13:26:00] <robertmaxrees> target something that encapsulates your "widget", so-to-speak
[13:26:16] <garethdaine> I don;t really understand mate
[13:26:22] <robertmaxrees> what part of that is confusing?
[13:27:39] <garethdaine> All of it, what do you mean when you say target a parent element (I understand what a parent element is), just don’t get why I would target ot
[13:28:00] <robertmaxrees> "How would I go about handling a click outside of the element to close (hide) the navigation" clarify this then.
[13:28:06] <harry1> how can I debug serilaized form data before I POST it to a ajax request
[13:28:14] <robertmaxrees> harry1 you use your console.
[13:28:20] <harry1> obviously you can't alert serilaized data
[13:28:27] <robertmaxrees> right, you use your console.
[13:28:38] <taplar> you can't?
[13:28:47] <robertmaxrees> you could but it'd be unreadable.
[13:28:50] <taplar> :)
[13:29:33] <taplar> could always check your network tab too
[13:29:53] <garethdaine> robertmaxrees: Basically, I wanted the plugin to handle all aspects, so if the menu element is clicked toggle the navigation, if anything else is clicked hide it, but I see that may be a bit odd, as the widget is specifically for the menu element and shouldn;t really be listening for things outside of it, am I on the right lines?
[13:30:09] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'd argue personally.
[13:30:22] <garethdaine> I see, well that makes sense now
[13:30:29] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you COULD bind a listener to the body to handle that part, but i really don't see the usefulness of making a widget at that point.
[13:30:39] <robertmaxrees> why extend all of jquery if you're going to do something like that.
[13:30:59] <garethdaine> Sure, I get it now. THanks for pointing it out.
[13:31:03] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:31:07] <Scriptonaut> I have a link, and when I click it, it sends a remote PATCH request to my server. in response I render JSON. What element do I bind to in order to catch the success/error event? The link that I clicked?
[13:31:35] <taplar> ajax?
[13:31:42] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut none.
[13:31:48] <robertmaxrees> the object itself.
[13:31:48] <Scriptonaut> yes with ajax
[13:31:49] <robertmaxrees> use .then()
[13:31:56] <Scriptonaut> hmm, never heard of that, I'll look it up
[13:32:16] <robertmaxrees> avoid listening on an element for that.
[13:32:41] <Scriptonaut> how can I use a then? I'm not sending the request with javascript?
[13:32:52] <robertmaxrees> how are you sending the response then?
[13:32:54] <Scriptonaut> I'm clicking the link, and making the link send me there via a PATCH
[13:33:04] <robertmaxrees> so you're not using ajax?
[13:33:10] <Scriptonaut> I uses ajax, but under the hood
[13:33:12] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[13:33:18] <robertmaxrees> literally nothing you're saying is making sense.
[13:33:19] <taplar> lol
[13:33:19] <Scriptonaut> I can't splice my code into it
[13:33:29] <Scriptonaut> ok, let me show you the source
[13:33:38] <robertmaxrees> "I'm not sending the request with javascript" - " I uses ajax, but under the hood"
[13:33:52] <Scriptonaut> Yes, that didn't make sense. I mean I'm not using my own javascript
[13:34:03] <robertmaxrees> okay, that's a different story.
[13:34:07] <robertmaxrees> check out global ajax events.
[13:34:34] <robertmaxrees> that assumes whatever you're worried about is using jquery for ajax fwiw.
[13:34:59] <vdox> Hi, can you help me to improve my code (best practice, indentationi'm beginner : https://jsfiddle.net/zerizerzhuouerz/erxsLdoL/4/
[13:35:12] <robertmaxrees> vdox sure.
[13:35:23] <robertmaxrees> first step - don't repeat yourself.
[13:35:31] <vdox> it works but there can be a better way to do :)
[13:35:41] <robertmaxrees> $('#learning') - if you're calling $() more than once, store the result in a variable and use that instead.
[13:35:55] <Scriptonaut> If I do a global ajax handler, then won't this thing fire on every single ajax success that occurs? I have hundreds of those occuring on this app
[13:36:18] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut you can look at the request to see if it's the one you care about.
[13:36:25] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you need to edit the code that's firing the request.
[13:36:30] <Scriptonaut> ok
[13:36:31] <Scriptonaut> thanks
[13:36:31] <robertmaxrees> which is imo the better way to do this.
[13:36:42] <Scriptonaut> I agree, I'm just trying to add a feature on someone else's code
[13:36:45] <Scriptonaut> I would have fired it myself
[13:36:52] <taplar> vdox: you could also stick your top variables (and anything using them) inside the $() so they are scoped down
[13:36:53] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut do you with with this person?
[13:37:09] <Scriptonaut> work with them? Yes
[13:37:12] <Scriptonaut> I'm talking to them right now
[13:37:16] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut thgen edit their code lol
[13:37:21] <Scriptonaut> that's what I'm doing :)
[13:37:22] <robertmaxrees> vdox also: if statements don't have scope - you should declare vars at the top of the current scope.
[13:37:26] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut :) rad.
[13:38:06] <taplar> forEach or $.each on an array can save some looping headaches
[13:38:06] <robertmaxrees> vdox for (var i=0; i< translation.length; i++) { don't use for loops.  you want forEach.  i'd split some of this logic into more discrete functions.
[13:38:42] <taplar> $("#answer").append(translation[i]); <-- avoid appending in a loop
[13:38:48] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:38:51] <taplar> collect the elements and append once
[13:38:57] <robertmaxrees> do a single .map() operation instead.
[13:39:19] <taplar> lol
[13:39:29] <taplar> actually no need for the loop at all, he already has the array
[13:39:37] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[13:39:45] <robertmaxrees> oh, hell, just a .join()
[13:39:50] <robertmaxrees> no need to map anything.
[13:39:52] <taplar> :)
[13:40:10] <vdox> can you show me ? :)
[13:40:22] <robertmaxrees> which part?
[13:40:26] <taplar> $("#answer").append(translation.join(''));
[13:40:37] <robertmaxrees> without the loop around it.
[13:40:38] <robertmaxrees> btwe.
[13:41:36] <harry1> if i pass a serialized form array data to php via an ajax request do I need to unserialize or decide it within the php?
[13:41:42] <vdox> there is obviously a lot to change , can you show me on jsffidle what I have to change if it does not bother you ?
[13:41:51] <robertmaxrees> vdox no.
[13:41:54] <robertmaxrees> we don't do that.
[13:42:08] <robertmaxrees> we'll teach you how, but you gotta do it yourself :)
[13:42:27] <taplar> vdox: start small.  first off robert mentioned not repeating yourself.  look through your code for places where your doing the same lookups over and over
[13:42:32] <taplar> fix those
[13:44:40] <vdox> thank your for your advices :)
[13:47:27] <harry1> if i want to pass form data in a url (ajax request) should i serialize the form data?
[13:47:48] <robertmaxrees> harry1 you've asked 3 or 4 variations on the same question.
[13:48:38] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to figure out how to send a form via ajax?
[13:48:45] <taplar> harry1: in regards to your php question, php auto parses inputs into $_GET, $_POST, and $_REQUEST
[13:49:01] <taplar> but that's more a ##php question
[13:49:02] <harry1> robertmaxrees: trying to figure out the best way to do this
[13:49:17] <robertmaxrees> harry1 parse the form into whatever format you want.  serialize it if that works for you.
[13:49:53] <harry1> i guess it make sense to serialize the entire form just once rather than stripping out each var
[13:50:04] <robertmaxrees> "stripping out each var"?
[13:50:08] <taplar> it's cleaner
[13:50:17] <taplar> aka future proof
[13:50:26] <robertmaxrees> make the JS side of things easier IMO./
[13:50:33] <harry1> I am passing the serialized array as follows: blah/foo/+$(this).serialArray()
[13:50:50] <taplar> uh, if you use the get method i believe it does that for you
[13:51:05] <robertmaxrees> that is not a method.
[13:52:44] <harry1> I was using a POST, changed that to GET
[13:53:08] <taplar> reason?
[13:53:21] <robertmaxrees> doesn't look like he has a post body.
[13:53:27] <harry1> I copied the code from an old ajax example
[13:53:28] <harry1> :(
[13:54:10] <taplar> ah, if he's going to do it that way sure.  i just figured let jquery do it
[13:55:12] <harry1> so now in my php when i debug the data which receives the GET: '[object Object],[object Object]'
[13:56:41] <taplar> have you tried debugging $_GET['oneofyourkeys'] ?
[13:57:18] <harry1> ok actually I need to post the data
[13:57:32] <harry1> my PHP framework is expecting the data in the url
[13:57:40] <harry1> but I can try as you said...
[13:57:44] <robertmaxrees> harry1 then it's a get.
[13:57:57] <robertmaxrees> post implies there's data in the body of the request.
[13:58:02] <robertmaxrees> get implies it's all int he URL.
[13:58:04] <robertmaxrees> *in the
[13:58:16] <harry1> thanks - head spinning :)
[13:59:26] <harry1> $_GET is an empty array
[13:59:46] <taplar> look at your network tab and find the request
[13:59:52] <taplar> make sure it's sending the data
[14:00:58] <harry1> looks as if the var is being passed in the url as: [object%20Object],[object%20Object]
[14:01:15] <harry1> url: "/subscribers/add/"+$(this).serializeArray(),
[14:01:26] <robertmaxrees> show us a fiddle with the form.
[14:01:29] <robertmaxrees> and stuff.
[14:01:33] <robertmaxrees> becuase something here isn't adding up.
[14:02:53] <taplar> wouldn't you want to give the serializeArray result to data?
[14:03:25] <taplar> string + object seems weird
[14:03:43] <robertmaxrees> it is weird.
[14:04:07] <robertmaxrees> you want https://api.jquery.com/serialize/ in that case.
[14:04:12] <robertmaxrees> but just use the data property.
[14:04:14] <harry1> https://jsfiddle.net/hr2w9pef/
[14:04:42] <robertmaxrees> harry1 you can't use serializeArray like that.
[14:05:38] <harry1> opps
[14:05:54] <harry1> yeah I see - just serialize() is enough
[14:11:18] <harry1> not a jquery issue of course, but any bi-lingual peeps know how to untangle this in php: ;_method=POST&data[User][email]=aaaaa;
[14:11:32] <harry1> that's how the serilzed data is arriving in my php controller
[14:11:37] <robertmaxrees> ask that in ##php :)
[14:11:53] <taplar> what do you mean untangle?
[14:12:03] <taplar> 'data[User][email]' is your key
[14:12:14] <taplar> i'm assuming that's the name of one of your form fields
[14:13:11] <harry1> it is but that gives me illegal string offsert
[14:13:20] <harry1> i need to do some kind of urldecode
[14:13:26] <taplar> single or double quotes?
[14:13:30] <harry1> singl
[14:13:32] <harry1> e
[14:13:49] <robertmaxrees> heh mind taking that to PM or ##php?
[14:13:54] <taplar> weird, may have to escape the [], other than that, yeah try ##php
[14:14:28] <harry1> cool - thanks guys!
[14:24:38] <z1haze> hello. i have a bit of an issue. I am using jquery to run a function on change of a html select menu, and its workinging properly, but for some reason its jumpingto the top of the page each time it updates.. any idea what that would happen?
[14:24:59] <z1haze> if that some behavior of the change() function or anything like that? because nothing in my code as far as i can tell calls this
[14:25:11] <robertmaxrees> would need to see the code.
[14:25:38] <z1haze> sure
[14:27:20] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/3E16S1W is all i have for calling the function and the function is http://dpaste.com/0TJ0NVF
[14:28:00] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[14:28:09] <robertmaxrees> sounds like maybe getGraph is your propblem.
[14:28:13] <z1haze> you looked that quickly?
[14:28:26] <robertmaxrees> i don't see any references to window.location.hash
[14:28:48] <robertmaxrees> (i'm not going to pick through almost 120 loc and read the docs for Highcharts)
[14:29:11] <robertmaxrees> i also don't see any references to offset, scrolltop, etc.
[14:30:49] <z1haze> hmm well what can i do do debug
[14:31:03] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you comment out that highcharts call?
[14:31:34] <z1haze> then nothing happens lol
[14:31:44] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so start playing with highcharts.
[14:31:47] <robertmaxrees> see what i'm getting at?
[14:33:21] <harry1> figured it out: requires: parse_str
[14:33:35] <harry1> that breaks the url string out into an array :)
[14:33:52] <robertmaxrees> wonder why that triggers the window to scroll
[14:35:03] <taplar> weird
[14:35:08] <awkwardCough> would that possibly cause it to re-render and thru scroll you to the top?
[14:35:16] <awkwardCough> *thus
[14:35:24] <robertmaxrees> why would the re-render trigger that?
[14:36:10] <vdox> robertmaxrees another thing change to not repeat the code? maybe the div https://jsfiddle.net/zerizerzhuouerz/erxsLdoL/7/
[14:36:46] <awkwardCough> looking at some of the docs, when you re-render the chart its wipes it out and redraws everything
[14:37:07] <robertmaxrees> the redraw shouldn't cause that unless tjhey're doing something weird.
[14:37:29] <robertmaxrees> vdox you need to declare those vars - var in front of the,./
[14:37:31] <robertmaxrees> *them
[14:37:52] <robertmaxrees> also: $($answer) - should just be $answer
[14:38:18] <robertmaxrees> $increment should just be increment - the $ is used to signify that it's a jquery object, but there it's just a number.
[14:40:00] <robertmaxrees> also, don't use a for loop for $answer.append(translation[i]); - like taplar said earlier, you can just do $answer.append(translation.join(''));
[14:40:24] <taplar> we were having him take small steps, :)
[14:40:29] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:40:58] <vdox> I change gradually :p
[14:41:10] <robertmaxrees> there's a list for you to change, at least.
[14:46:32] <graphettion> robertmaxrees: Can I ask you a quick JS question?
[14:46:39] <robertmaxrees> don't ask to ask.  just ask.
[14:47:01] <graphettion> kk, I was asking because of channel javascript vs jquery. But asking...
[14:47:13] <taplar> i want a slow question.  i can't read fast
[14:47:21] <graphettion> lol
[14:47:44] <graphettion> Given the URL: http://example.com/?tag=
[14:48:04] <graphettion> would location.search.indexOf('?tag=') > -1 be true?
[14:48:14] <robertmaxrees> what do you think?
[14:48:18] <graphettion> I think it is.
[14:48:26] <robertmaxrees> test it.
[14:48:45] <robertmaxrees> window.location.search returns a string.
[14:48:47] <graphettion> I tried it on my system and it returns false
[14:49:06] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so then the actual url isn't what you think it is :) what is window.location.search returning in your case?
[14:49:07] <graphettion> But I would think it would be true.
[14:49:19] <graphettion> ?tag=
[14:49:30] <graphettion> it returns: ?tag=
[14:49:38] <robertmaxrees> then you have an issue elsewhere in your code.
[14:50:01] <graphettion> That's what I was thinking. Thanks!
[14:51:41] <vdox> I have a jquery object, i need to use join ? https://jsfiddle.net/zerizerzhuouerz/erxsLdoL/12/
[14:52:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:52:06] <robertmaxrees> what's the jquery object?
[14:52:18] <vdox> theDiv.data
[14:52:38] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:52:46] <robertmaxrees> aaaah it's an array of jquery objects.
[14:52:57] <robertmaxrees> that's weird.
[14:53:21] <robertmaxrees> wait so what's going on here?
[14:54:16] <vdox> I need an object to indicate whether it is correct or not
[14:54:17] <robertmaxrees> you're repeating a ton of work.
[14:54:29] <vdox> :/
[14:55:02] <robertmaxrees> and doing it really inconsistently.
[14:55:20] <robertmaxrees> your translation array is inconsistent is the issue - you're mixing strings and jquery objects.
[14:57:31] <robertmaxrees> 2 ideas: 1, you should really use https://api.jquery.com/add/ if you want to create this kind of setup, though 2, you'd be better served by a templating engine, but that's probably overkill here.
[14:57:46] <|PiP|> anyone know how to filter out rows in DataTables? I’m trying to hide rows based on checkboxes that would hide/show rows with certain CSS classes
[14:57:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:58:02] <taplar> you'll have to write a custom filter
[14:58:08] <robertmaxrees> datatables just needs to make an irc channel already hahaha
[14:58:12] <taplar> :)
[14:58:21] <Uhkis> indeed
[14:58:36] <taplar> one sec, i believe we have an example of one...
[14:58:56] <|PiP|> their API doesn’t let you simple do something like
[14:59:11] <|PiP|> dt.rows(‘.some-class’).hide()
[14:59:25] <|PiP|> dt.rows(‘.some-class’).show()
[14:59:51] <vdox> I keep .join ?
[14:59:59] <taplar> |PiP|: https://jsfiddle.net/jLj8auns/
[15:00:14] <robertmaxrees> vdox you need to completely refactor the way you're building that array.
[15:00:51] <taplar> |PiP|: put whatever you need in the function, it needs to return true or false
[15:00:57] <|PiP|> thank you
[15:02:18] <|PiP|> their API not intuitive at all
[15:02:30] <taplar> first time i've heard that
[15:02:57] <vdox> may be that I did not need to use .data to check if it is correct or not
[15:12:54] <z1haze> hey robertmaxrees in my function to the graph, how can i give it a name? because i found a way that I can just change the data inside without hopefully calling the whole thing again
[15:14:20] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you're talking about
[15:15:16] <z1haze> i cant do chart.series[0].setData(data,true); but now do i get my chart to be named chart
[15:15:30] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/0TJ0NVF
[15:15:44] <robertmaxrees> "how do i get my chart to be named chart"
[15:15:46] <robertmaxrees> waaaay lost.
[15:15:51] <z1haze> would i just do like var chart = $('#graph').highcharts('StockChart', { ...
[15:15:53] <z1haze> i meant can*
[15:16:02] <robertmaxrees> maybe?
[15:16:10] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea how highcharts works or wht it returns.
[15:18:13] <z1haze> ok
[15:18:41] <awkwardCough> z1haze: on line 8 you are creating your chart, just define the var at a higher level and assign it there
[15:18:43] <z1haze> if i have a var chart; and then in my success: function(data) { ... i do chart = ...
[15:18:46] <taplar> heh, i've created another addict
[15:18:59] <awkwardCough> ^ >_>
[15:19:04] <robertmaxrees> looks like awkwardCough has you covered.
[15:19:51] <z1haze> thats exactly what ive done
[15:19:54] <z1haze> and its undefined
[15:20:02] <robertmaxrees> show us?
[15:20:50] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/1CP0BYB
[15:21:13] <taplar> once getGraphs terminates that var is gone
[15:21:26] <robertmaxrees> that's only availabl inside of getGraph.
[15:21:32] <taplar> are you trying to use it outside?
[15:21:38] <z1haze> yea
[15:21:42] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[15:21:42] <z1haze> just in console
[15:21:52] <z1haze> ok so define it outside of my function
[15:21:57] <robertmaxrees> use a return instead.
[15:21:58] <taplar> can you take......it hiiiiiigher?
[15:22:03] <robertmaxrees> return Highcharts.setOptions({
[15:22:16] <robertmaxrees> then you can just call getGraph() and that gives you your object.
[15:22:25] <z1haze> oh ok
[15:25:15] <z1haze> so now i just need a way to get the data separately from that function
[15:25:33] <robertmaxrees> "get the data separately from that function"?
[15:25:34] <z1haze> can you do var something = $.getJSON('http://')
[15:25:41] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:25:46] <robertmaxrees> that's an async function.
[15:25:55] <z1haze> yea i mean to update the data
[15:25:57] <robertmaxrees> need to pass it whatever logic you want it to run when it's done.
[15:25:58] <z1haze> i build myself an api
[15:26:04] <z1haze> so now i just need to change the data
[15:26:07] <z1haze> chart.series[0].setData(data,true);
[15:26:17] <robertmaxrees> something = $.getJSON() will just give you a jqXHR object.
[15:26:18] <z1haze> var data = make json request to my server
[15:26:25] <z1haze> oh
[15:27:22] <vdox> https://jsfiddle.net/zerizerzhuouerz/erxsLdoL/15/  other advices ? :)
[15:27:24] <z1haze> i currently return the data like this: https://gyazo.com/500959bc479cbc645367dab28f5634b3 and this is how it need to be
[15:27:46] <z1haze> how can i just make a call to store that in a variable and pass it into setData
[15:28:21] <robertmaxrees> z1haze you pass setData as a callback.
[15:28:22] <taplar> vdox: ln 51, look into changing that to use forEach()
[15:28:23] <robertmaxrees> but that's really janky.
[15:28:30] <z1haze> $.getJSON($(location).attr('protocol') + '//' + $(location).attr('hostname') + '/api/getstats/' + a + '/' + b, function (data) { chart.setData(data, true); wont work?
[15:29:08] <vdox> ok :)
[15:29:45] <taplar> actually hold off
[15:30:15] <taplar> vdox: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal_Objects%2FArray%2Fmap
[15:31:36] <taplar> you can use map and avoid all the pushing and stuff
[15:34:22] <vdox> map is better that foreach() ?
[15:34:34] <robertmaxrees> wrong question ;)
[15:34:35] <taplar> in this case yes, because you are transforming the data
[15:35:50] <vdox> ok I will try :)
[15:36:47] <z1haze> ok so.. i have var chart = getGraph(1, 'players'); and it draws the draw with the correct data.. but when i go to console and type chart i get undefined
[15:36:55] <z1haze> how is that possible if it draws the chart
[15:36:59] <taplar> in the fiddle?
[15:37:54] <taplar> nvm, you didn't have a fiddle
[15:38:23] <z1haze> i can make you one
[15:39:21] <z1haze> actually i cant because my data is local
[15:39:32] <robertmaxrees> it's a standalone example.
[15:39:36] <robertmaxrees> no need for your data.
[15:40:20] <z1haze> ok ill fake it
[15:49:46] <vdox> taplar i need to use foreach right ? https://jsfiddle.net/zerizerzhuouerz/erxsLdoL/16/
[15:50:13] <taplar> for which part?
[15:50:31] <robertmaxrees> vdox you still haven't declare two vars up top btw.
[15:50:38] <vdox> line 57
[15:51:17] <taplar> no, 51-55 would use map() which returns the array that you'd later append
[15:51:36] <vdox> robertmaxrees $learning => var learning ?
[15:51:49] <robertmaxrees> vdox yes.  var before them all.
[15:55:18] <vdox> without $ it doesn't work :/
[15:55:20] <vdox> https://jsfiddle.net/zerizerzhuouerz/erxsLdoL/18/
[15:55:30] <robertmaxrees> err.
[15:55:57] <robertmaxrees> didn't realize that was still a jquery object.
[15:56:31] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/erxsLdoL/19/
[15:57:42] <taplar> that's still a scope issue no?  defining in the namespace, and using in a function declared outside?
[15:58:59] <robertmaxrees> which?
[15:59:15] <taplar> question is defined outside the namespace
[15:59:31] <taplar> and tries to use the vars inside
[15:59:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:59:55] <robertmaxrees> ooooh.
[15:59:55] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[16:00:06] <robertmaxrees> can't traverse scopes like that.  dunno why those vars got moved.
[16:01:21] <z1haze> i cant figure out how to makea fiddle of it
[16:03:18] <z1haze> ok I found this: Im able to do var chart = getGraph(1, 'players'); and it creates the var variable and updates the graph
[16:03:30] <robertmaxrees> the var variable.
[16:03:57] <vdox> i keep $learning, $answer ?
[16:04:05] <z1haze> but on page load it says chart is not defined even though the first line of code on the page i do var chart = getGraph(1, 'players');
[16:04:14] <z1haze> yea i messed up typing
[16:04:26] <robertmaxrees> vdox do you understnad what 'scope' is?
[16:04:42] <vdox> yes
[16:04:53] <robertmaxrees> so then you understand why your code doesn't work, right?
[16:05:16] <vdox> yes
[16:05:22] <robertmaxrees> then fix that.
[16:05:24] <robertmaxrees> problem solved.
[16:05:32] <vdox> I try to follow but I do not speak English very well
[16:06:01] <robertmaxrees> so then you DON'T understand scope?
[16:06:09] <robertmaxrees> i'm really confused about where the confusion lies at this point :)
[16:06:37] <vdox> I understand ^^
[16:46:10] <vdox> how to declare a global function ? https://jsfiddle.net/zerizerzhuouerz/erxsLdoL/21/ :)
[16:46:29] <robertmaxrees> why would you do that?
[16:46:58] <robertmaxrees> and you have two global functions in that fiddle.
[16:47:37] <vdox> makeDiv doesn't work in question()
[16:47:49] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with the function's scope.
[16:47:53] <robertmaxrees> translation
[16:47:57] <robertmaxrees> that var only exists in question()
[16:48:24] <taplar> and we've stated that you want map, not forEach dude, :)
[16:48:47] <vdox> I was more comfortable with foreach ^^
[16:48:53] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[16:48:57] <robertmaxrees> then why are you asking for input?
[16:49:02] <robertmaxrees> map is exactly what you want here.
[16:49:15] <taplar> can't get more comfortable through lack of use
[16:49:20] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:49:23] <robertmaxrees> if you're confused, say so.
[16:49:34] <robertmaxrees> but don't for ask for help and then ignore that advice.
[17:00:12] <vdox> I follow your advices :) https://jsfiddle.net/zerizerzhuouerz/erxsLdoL/23/ except  $answer and $learning ( I'll change after ) you have other tips ? robertmaxrees taplar
[17:02:13] <taplar> mmm, if you set the html of $learning and $answer, you wouldn't have to clear them out
[17:03:32] <taplar> and on ln 50 no need to assign it an empty list.  it's just going to be tossed away
[17:05:48] <vdox> I remove the line 50, what do you mean by  set html ?
[17:06:15] <taplar> instead of append() you can use html()
[17:06:24] <taplar> the difference is html() is a complete replace
[17:06:47] <taplar> like on line 45
[17:07:05] <taplar> but instead of html('') followed by append(stuff) you could just do html(newStuff)
[17:07:17] <vdox> oh : $answer.html(translation.join(' '));
[17:07:21] <taplar> yep
[17:07:26] <vdox> thank you :)
[17:07:35] <taplar> same with $learning
[17:07:59] <vdox> I also edit
[17:09:09] <taplar> yeah so now on ln 48 just stick a var in front of the variable
[17:10:42] <vdox> var translation ?
[17:10:47] <taplar> yup
[17:10:57] <taplar> so it's scoped down to the question function
[17:11:53] <vdox> oh ok
[17:12:14] <taplar> you want to try to scope down as much as possible for a couple reasons
[17:12:30] <taplar> first it helps prevent the cases where variable names conflict
[17:12:40] <taplar> so you change stuff that your not aware your changing
[17:12:52] <robertmaxrees> also prevents other things form changing those variables.
[17:12:56] <robertmaxrees> *from
[17:13:19] <taplar> and second being that once something goes out of scope, javascript can perform garbage collection on it, provided nothing else has a reference to it
[17:13:35] <taplar> so you don't have things your not going to use anymore hanging around taking up space
[17:15:14] <vdox> Noted :)
[17:17:29] <taplar> other than that i only really saw a couple more things, and possibly doing some better naming of things
[17:17:46] <robertmaxrees> vdox what've you learned so far today? :)
[17:20:14] <vdox> do not repeat the code, attention to the scope and much knowledge in javascript. I really want to thank you robertmaxrees and taplar :)
[17:21:37] <vdox> I started in javascript and I am trying to learn the best practices as soon as possible
[17:22:12] <taplar> in that case i'll go ahead and mention the better naming thing
[17:22:28] <taplar> take ln 20 for example
[17:22:41] <taplar> you got a comment explaining what that variable is
[17:22:59] <taplar> could you name it differently so that, that comment is not needed?
[17:23:33] <vdox> hmm var current_question ?
[17:23:47] <taplar> if you read that, would you know what it was?
[17:24:56] <taplar> what does that variable contain/reference/mean?
[17:25:32] <vdox> it represents the current question
[17:25:36] <taplar> how so?
[17:26:37] <vdox> with a number
[17:26:52] <taplar> how do you get the question with that number?
[17:28:01] <vdox> by cards
[17:28:11] <taplar> how so? :)
[17:29:30] <vdox> cards_number is a good name ?
[17:29:49] <taplar> your using it as an index, yes?
[17:29:53] <vdox> yes
[17:30:03] <taplar> so it's the current question's index?
[17:30:23] <vdox> index_cards because it's the current question's index ?
[17:30:37] <taplar> but it's not an index cards
[17:30:51] <taplar> it's exactly that.  'the current questions index'
[17:31:44] <vdox> current_questions_index
[17:31:51] <taplar> sure
[17:32:19] <taplar> i have no doubt what that variable is intended to be
[17:32:32] <taplar> further more, i have some insight into how your going to use it
[17:32:37] <taplar> just from reading thename
[17:32:40] <taplar> *the name
[17:33:19] <taplar> good names not only tell you what they are, but give some insight into their purpose
[17:33:48] <taplar> coming back to some code that you haven't touched in a while, if the name can tell you something of the intended purpose of the logic, then you don't have to guess as much
[17:34:13] <taplar> and if you can guess the intended purpose, and the logic isn't doing that, then even better.  something is probably broken
[17:35:09] <taplar> with that in mind, what could be done with our function 'question' ?
[17:36:10] <vdox> current_question ?
[17:36:22] <taplar> no the function
[17:36:43] <taplar> or were you suggesting a name?
[17:37:03] <vdox> currentQuestion() *
[17:37:27] <taplar> if you read that, would you know what it's supposed to do?
[17:37:41] <taplar> what does that function do?
[17:37:56] <vdox> maybe showQuestion
[17:38:10] <taplar> that works
[17:38:36] <vdox> the function displays a question to user
[17:39:15] <taplar> i could guess that from showQuestion
[17:39:41] <vdox> your advices taking place in my head :p
[17:39:58] <taplar> i'm like prof x over here
[17:43:13] <vdox> thank you again for the help
[17:43:27] <taplar> np
[17:44:23] <vdox> I have to go, have a good day
[17:44:38] <taplar> you the same
[17:45:41] <cangelosx> is e = $.Event() the same as e = jQuery.Event() ?
[17:45:52] <robertmaxrees> $ is an "alias" for jQuery generally.
[17:46:41] <cangelosx> so it's always safe to replace `jQuery` with $ ?
[17:46:51] <robertmaxrees> that depend.s
[17:46:56] <robertmaxrees> if you're in noconflict mode, no.
[17:47:01] <robertmaxrees> if you're not, yes.
[17:47:05] <robertmaxrees> or if you're in a "jquery closure"
[17:54:37] <Shai-Tan> Why can I not see anything in my POST on the server when I POST this?  http://pastie.org/10734917
[17:55:03] <robertmaxrees> Shai-Tan what does your network tab tell you?
[17:55:38] <Shai-Tan> it shows going to the correct place, and that the POST array (echo'ed from server) is empty
[17:55:50] <taplar> return 'End Call'; heh
[17:56:56] <Shai-Tan> It also shows Form Data: foo
[17:57:57] <taplar> it may be having an issue since it's not a key value pair
[18:03:42] <taplar> or google how to read put data in php.  pretty much the same answer
[18:04:44] <taplar> i'm out!
[18:19:13] <vnull> hello ppl
[18:26:11] <robertmaxrees> HULLO
[18:30:53] <vnull> Is it possible to ask for libs herE?
[18:34:45] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[18:40:18] <robertmaxrees> vnull are you looking for a suggestion?
[18:43:34] <vnull> I need jQuery for notifications
[18:43:59] <vnull> to be compatible with twitter bootstrap
[18:44:07] <robertmaxrees> you mean like modals?
[18:44:08] <vnull> I found simple one. I'm testing
[18:44:22] <vnull> Like fb notification. this small bottom-right popups
[18:56:38] <vnull> i've a href with span inside. i want to check if span exists and change its value if not append new span
[18:58:50] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[18:58:59] <robertmaxrees> so check if the span is there :)
[18:59:51] <vnull> if(selector.has('span').length) in this case exists true?
[19:00:34] <robertmaxrees> use .find() instead.
[19:01:05] <vnull> so it would selector.find('span').length?
[19:01:13] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'd do.
[19:01:32] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[19:01:37] <robertmaxrees> what is selector ?
[19:01:48] <vnull> $('')
[19:02:00] <robertmaxrees> and there's only one link you care about?
[19:02:14] <vnull> Will its has one span or none.
[19:02:22] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i asked :)
[19:02:30] <vnull> yes..
[19:02:37] <robertmaxrees> then yeah.
[19:02:39] <robertmaxrees> should work fine.,
[19:03:03] <vnull> Don't worry i'm not doing $(a) :P
[19:03:05] <vnull> 'a'
[19:03:09] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[19:03:20] <vnull> i've custom attributes to select
[19:03:23] <robertmaxrees> err.
[19:03:24] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[19:03:33] <vnull> O.o why?
[19:03:41] <robertmaxrees> custom attribute selectors are slow and hard to read.
[19:03:51] <robertmaxrees> and custom attributes aren't technically something you can do.
[19:04:38] <vnull> i've like <a data-attr="something"></a> and i'm selectro $('a[data-attr="something"])
[19:04:43] <robertmaxrees> yeah don't do that.
[19:04:50] <robertmaxrees> data attributes are meant to store data, not be selected on.
[19:05:10] <robertmaxrees> also, they can be changed with .data(), which doens't modify the markup so you'll quickly lose track of things.
[19:05:25] <robertmaxrees> if you really want to use data attributes for selecting , use a class and .filter() that instea.d
[19:05:31] <vnull> adding unique class name is better
[19:05:53] <robertmaxrees> "unique class name" heh
[19:05:55] <kevireilly> or an ID if it is truly unique
[19:06:05] <robertmaxrees> eh, i'd avoid an ID if possible.
[19:06:07] <robertmaxrees> but doable.
[19:06:37] <vnull> -.- behave
[19:06:41] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[19:06:43] <kevireilly> might be a lil odd for an anchor indeed
[19:07:16] <vnull> wrong chat
[19:07:21] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:07:40] <vnull> The problem i've tons of class's so keep following names kill
[19:07:42] <vnull> kills me
[19:07:55] <robertmaxrees> the classnames should be easy to understand and remember.
[19:08:13] <arc_> can't you just make the class name the same as the value of the data attribute you were selecting by
[19:08:21] <arc_> that's pretty much the same thing
[19:08:32] <vnull> true arc_
[19:08:35] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:08:38] <robertmaxrees> now you don't have a class.
[19:08:43] <robertmaxrees> and you're munging the point of classes.
[19:08:52] <arc_> depends on what the value is
[19:09:12] <arc_> but yeah i guess in some cases that could be
[19:09:18] <vnull> Anyway, what's the different between $('a > span') vs $('a span') ?
[19:09:27] <robertmaxrees> > is direct child
[19:09:32] <robertmaxrees> jsut a space is any descendent.
[19:12:23] <vnull> I love errors
[19:12:30] <vnull> appendChild is not a function
[19:12:55] <robertmaxrees> i'll bet you're calling iton something that isn't a jquery object.
[19:14:01] <vnull> my bad
[19:14:12] <vnull> DOMs jQuery all in head :D
[19:14:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:25:44] <vnull> thx guys <3
[19:29:44] <Distraught> https://jsfiddle.net/z60ub155/8/
[19:30:05] <robertmaxrees> kill the script tag out of the javascript area.
[19:30:52] <robertmaxrees> also: .theiaPostSlider_nav _center_full is trying to select <_center_full> as a child of that class.
[19:30:57] <robertmaxrees> '.theiaPostSlider_nav._center_full' is what you want.
[19:31:16] <Distraught> .theiaPostSlider_nav i guess is enought
[19:31:31] <Distraught> > kill the script tag out of the javascript area . What do you mean. I dont have any script there
[19:31:33] <robertmaxrees> you aren't going to have more than one .brm, right?
[19:31:37] <Distraught> no
[19:32:05] <robertmaxrees> at the bottom of the javascript pane there's a </script>
[19:32:12] <robertmaxrees> under your code.
[19:32:56] <Distraught> y. Works on jfiddle not on my site
[19:32:58] <Distraught> grrrr
[19:33:06] <robertmaxrees> open your console?
[19:33:39] <robertmaxrees> any errors?
[19:33:57] <Distraught> no errors. THe class in mhy site accually is theiaPostSlider_nav _center_full fontTheme _lower
[19:34:05] <Distraught> it has some spaces . There are 3 classes
[19:34:09] <Distraught> Does this matter?
[19:34:16] <robertmaxrees> not if you're selecting them right.
[19:34:20] <robertmaxrees> $('.theiaPostSlider_nav')
[19:34:25] <robertmaxrees> should be enough
[19:34:54] <Distraught> :S
[19:34:59] <robertmaxrees> link to the site?
[19:35:06] <Distraught> https://www.sarotiko.gr/2016/02/21/501-apithanes-idees-apokriatikes-stoles/
[19:35:14] <Distraught> there is a first bar
[19:35:22] <Distraught> Which sais read the whole article.
[19:35:44] <Distraught> The second bar shows the pages of the article. I want to hide them if the first bar has display:none
[19:35:45] <robertmaxrees> i don't see where it says that.
[19:35:58] <Distraught> y it's greek :S
[19:36:00] <robertmaxrees> uh
[19:36:06] <Distraught> Under the first advertisement
[19:36:08] <robertmaxrees> you have a bunch of errors and warnings.
[19:36:18] <robertmaxrees> you need to fix those first.
[19:36:35] <Distraught> these 2 are from advertisements
[19:36:37] <robertmaxrees> also: learn how to use console.log()
[19:36:40] <Distraught> no jquery involved
[19:36:43] <Distraught> oh
[19:36:44] <robertmaxrees> i see many more errors.
[19:36:49] <Distraught> console.log()
[19:37:02] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what that does?
[19:37:23] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 is a good tutorial on how to debug.
[19:37:33] <Distraught> yes but i need to search this on google. Have not used it before
[19:37:53] <robertmaxrees> look at the tutorial i linked you.
[19:37:59] <robertmaxrees> it'll show you everything you need to know.
[19:38:05] <Distraught> robertt
[19:38:16] <Distraught> the only errros i see are from iframes of advertisements
[19:38:30] <robertmaxrees> read the tutorial :)
[19:43:47] <Distraught> well robertmaxrees
[19:44:02] <Distraught> the problem is that style="display:none" goes after the page load
[19:44:04] <Distraught> s
[19:46:56] <robertmaxrees> what sets that?
[19:49:13] <vnull> robertmaxrees find. find() search for child only or go through sub-children
[19:49:14] <vnull> ?
[19:52:04] <robertmaxrees> vnull .find() looks at all descendents.
[19:52:19] <vnull> Thanks again
[19:52:29] <robertmaxrees> the docs tell you as much,.
[20:37:27] <vnull> robert u still around?
[21:10:47] <zquad> do you have to submit a form's data to serialize() it or to get its data? Is form data only availible on('submit')
[21:10:49] <zquad> ??
[21:11:20] <shoky> zquad no it's available anytime
[21:12:00] <zquad>  I am unable to get the value in an input box, MUST it have a value attribute?
[21:12:03] <zquad> to get it
[21:12:22] <shoky> no it must have a name
[21:15:14] <zquad> :) oooohhhh. I assume a value="" attribute was automatically added to the dom
[21:15:34] <zquad> or added when adding the element to the dom
[21:50:56] <__haider> hi
[21:51:00] <__haider> hai*
[21:51:02] <__haider> der
[21:51:25] <zquad> I have an input in an html form. I can get the value of the input $('#formId input').val() return the string in the input box. However $('#formId input').serialize() or .serializeArray() is empty. What might be the issue here?
[21:53:25] <zquad> have to give the inputs a name -__-
[21:53:28] <zquad> fucking jquery
[21:58:36] <arc_> how would you serialize an input field if it doesn't have a name
[22:01:52] <___haider> i'm trying to make an ajax script that submits post data to a form when a button is pressed from form data residing on the current document. here is what i have: https://i.gyazo.com/bc0609d71ae85e64ddd852de6d63192b.png
[22:01:55] <___haider> but it's not working
[22:02:03] <___haider> can anybody point me in the right direction to debug my own script?
[22:02:09] <___haider> or maybe let me know what i may be doing wrong?
[22:29:32] <elisa87> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35592690/load-in-jquery-doesnt-work you know what I should do?
