[00:02:37] <Lucaszz> Hi, has any one used jqGrid?
[00:06:15] <coldhead> oh lord who will comfort me
[00:20:56] <slide263> coldhead you on?
[00:21:37] <slide263> or cork?
[00:21:48] <coldhead> now now, let's not play favourites
[00:22:10] <slide263> well you know my problem already so i figured i would come back to you
[00:22:24] <coldhead> i don't rememer your problem
[00:22:24] <slide263> i am help222 from yesterday if you recall
[00:22:28] <coldhead> oh right
[00:22:31] <coldhead> server2go
[00:22:33] <Cork> slide263: please just ask the question instead of pinging ppl...
[00:22:35] <coldhead> i nominate Cork
[00:22:36] <slide263> yea
[00:22:40] <slide263> lol
[00:22:48] <coldhead> i gotta go get some weird lumps burned off
[00:23:02] <slide263> ok then
[00:23:36] <slide263> well anyway for whoever wouldn't mind helping. http://dpaste.com/1078645/ is what my code is at atm
[00:24:02] <slide263> my js seems to be working but i cannot figure out where to put my images to make the slider show them properly
[00:24:18] <Mullazman> Hi guys
[00:24:34] <Mullazman> Can I ask you guys, which is better performing, replacing a single divs content for the illusion of a different page OR use multiple pages (Jquery) within a single html document OR use multiple html pages? I'm leaning towards the former because it's easy to have one document and swap in and out content as required, just wondering if that's a stupid idea for any reason?
[00:29:36] <Mullazman> no one wants to answer that? :(
[00:30:00] <Nemurenai> Mullazman, hmm...
[00:30:26] <Nemurenai> I think you should choose the way that is easiest.
[00:30:36] <Nemurenai> I don't think there's much of a difference in performance
[00:31:01] <Cork> Mullazman: are you talking about loading fragments into the page vs full page reloads or what do you mean?
[00:31:25] <Cork> full page replace can't be done as the js state will still be left
[00:31:39] <Cork> (and header won't be parsed and so on)
[00:31:47] <Nemurenai> All the compositing is hardware accelerated anyway, so unless you have a thousand pages you want to keep in memory and swap between, I don't think there's much of a penalty
[00:32:39] <Cork> the penalty lays in loading time
[00:33:00] <Cork> and there is quite a bit of difference depending on what you mean in the question
[00:33:26] <slide263> http://dpaste.com/1078645/ I need to know where to put my images to make my slideshow work... I put one in the div because that was where the active border was after the js started working but the slideshow won't work..
[00:33:41] <Nemurenai> I've made a system that has multiple pages where I load the content of the new page in background, then swap it in when it's finished loading
[00:33:53] <Nemurenai> It works fine
[00:35:59] <paul_> Hey guys, i ran into a problem with CSS that i think i have to solve with jQuery. Is that within the scope of this channel?
[00:36:54] <screamingbanshee> paul_ usually
[00:37:22] <tw2113> i personally find it suspect that it can't be solved with just css and needs js to fix
[00:37:26] <tw2113> but continue
[00:37:29] <paul_> http://jsfiddle.net/GB64n/1/
[00:37:30] <screamingbanshee> ^ agree
[00:37:35] <paul_> I went to the css channel,
[00:37:43] <tw2113> my condolences
[00:38:07] <Cork> lol
[00:38:10] <paul_> and basically because CSS can't 'select upwards' through DOM, it seems i need to use something else
[00:38:29] <tw2113> first tell us what you're trying to achieve
[00:38:32] <paul_> im a beginner at css and jquery, so forgive me for my ignorance, but anyway:
[00:38:50] <paul_> I have my 4 divs with text on the right side of the page (navigation menu)
[00:39:07] <paul_> with css it's easy enough to create hover declarations for the text,
[00:39:23] <paul_> but i want the DIVS to be effected when mouse hovers on the TEXT
[00:39:38] <screamingbanshee> ok, so target that too :)
[00:39:48] <Cork> you mean #left to be ex colored from the li's ?
[00:39:50] <tw2113> div:hover
[00:40:06] <paul_> #left is just garbage that i need to throw out :P
[00:40:10] <tw2113> div:hover a
[00:40:20] <Cork> then what div?
[00:40:30] <seutje> that would trigger when hovering the div but not the text, is that an issue?
[00:40:32] <paul_> the #right divs
[00:40:41] <paul_> yeah that is, seutje
[00:41:11] <seutje> yeah than u'll need some js help, I'm afraid, don't think parent selector is implemented anywhere as of yet
[00:41:16] <paul_> i want, SPECIFICALLY, to have Div and Txt 'highlight' at the same time, when i hover SPECIFICALLY over txt
[00:41:17] <tw2113> basically target the parent with the hover pseudo-selector and descend inwards
[00:41:38] <seutje> this scares me though: /* ie5win fudge begins */
[00:41:53] <paul_> haha yeah well..
[00:42:06] <paul_> this is my first attempt at a website
[00:42:22] <tw2113> i'd say use .hover() on the links to add a class to the parent div
[00:42:25] <paul_> soooo, you know.. had to find some kind of predone layout code to base my stuff off of
[00:42:26] <tw2113> and style the class
[00:42:42] <Cork> ya
[00:42:53] <tw2113> or .on('hover') etc
[00:42:56] <seutje> old skool suckerfish style
[00:43:20] <Cork> you might want to use mouseenter/mouseleave actually
[00:43:23] <seutje> can u .on('hover')?
[00:43:25] <seutje> yeah
[00:43:32] <Cork> seutje: yes you can
[00:43:51] <paul_> well i was doing some awful looking mouse enter/ mouse leave code before hand
[00:43:56] <seutje> oh, cool
[00:44:08] <tw2113> but now you have jquery's handling paul_ !
[00:44:15] <tw2113> less ugly, less suck
[00:44:21] <paul_> but i definitely did not know what i was doing :P
[00:44:27] <paul_> handling?
[00:45:37] <Cork> paul_: http://jsfiddle.net/GB64n/3/
[00:45:51] <Cork> replace this.id with a better value if you want it
[00:46:20] <seutje> don't think I'll ever use .on('hover'
[00:46:44] <seutje> I'll take the few bytes and suck it up :P
[00:46:46] <Cork> i prefer to use mouseover mouseout
[00:47:01] <screamingbanshee> * agree
[00:47:14] <paul_> hmm okay, i trust you completely, as im very new, but i want to understand what you gave me, cork
[00:47:27] <paul_> i understand the 'on mouseenter' portion
[00:47:28] <Cork> paul_: it's a delegated event listener
[00:47:47] <Cork> it binds to the #right, and listens for bubbling mouse events from .swatch
[00:47:59] <paul_> okay, i think i misspoke about which specific Div,
[00:48:02] <Cork> and when that happens att the id from that element as a class on the div
[00:48:12] <paul_> #right is the parent to the divs i want to highlight
[00:48:19] <screamingbanshee> that's right paul
[00:48:23] <paul_> so i should replace "#right" with those, correct?
[00:48:23] <Cork> ya?
[00:48:29] <Cork> what?
[00:48:39] <screamingbanshee> no
[00:48:48] <screamingbanshee> you want it on #right
[00:48:56] <Cork> paul_: delegate is so you don't have to bind one specific event listener to each element
[00:49:07] <Cork> it listens for the events as they bubble up from the children
[00:49:34] <Cork> the target is the swatch elements in thie case
[00:49:42] <paul_> delegation and bubbling.. just trying ... to wrap my head... blaaaaargh lol
[00:49:58] <maxorator> does $.when(a,b,c).then() failFilter trigger immediately when either a, b or c fails, or only when they all have at least finished, but one of them failed
[00:50:01] <Cork> paul_: in the dom the event happens on the element
[00:50:22] <paul_> for future reference, where do people who are serious about jQuery, web design, etc, go for learning? tutorial sites? learning by doing? here?
[00:50:28] <Cork> paul_: and then it triggers on each parent element through out the page up until the document element
[00:51:02] <Cork> paul_: most of the serous part isn't specific for jquery
[00:51:21] <screamingbanshee> (jquery just happens to be made of win)
[00:51:28] <Cork> just basic dom + css + native js good practices and knowledge
[00:51:58] <Cork> and api.jquery.com is the only thing needed atop of that
[00:52:01] <screamingbanshee> don't learn jquery. use jquery. learn js.
[00:52:04] <Cork> to find the different jquery commands
[00:52:15] <Cork> and don't forget to learn how the dom works
[00:52:35] <Cork> it will be an integrate part of every thing you do
[00:52:41] <Cork> so better know how to handle it
[00:53:08] <paul_> well i've went through the 'streams' of codecademy's html, css, javascript, jquery,
[00:53:14] <Cork> (and if you don't the page will easily work like shit)
[00:53:31] <paul_> but from where they end off, I'm obviously no where near the level of proficiency i'd like to be at
[00:53:37] <Cork> paul_: then what's left is experience
[00:53:43] <paul_> yeah fair enough
[00:53:45] <Cork> and ya, then this is as good a place as any
[00:55:14] <Cork> the number one problem ppl have to my experience is mixing up css selectors and dom, html and dom
[00:55:21] <paul_> okay so, cork, i just replace "this.id" with "this.The actual ID/Class i want to use", right?
[00:55:38] <Cork> if you make sure you know what is what and where you have where
[00:55:42] <screamingbanshee> no
[00:55:45] <Cork> you will be at the head of the pack
[00:56:16] <Cork> paul_: i would sugest that you add a data-hover="" or similar on the element
[00:56:16] <paul_> so understanding DOM is understanding the heirarchy?
[00:56:33] <Cork> paul_: and then use $(this).data('hover') for the class to remove and add
[00:56:51] <Cork> paul_: no, dom is the beast that lets you make the page live
[00:57:06] <Cork> it is what lets events flow, it is what triggers the page to rerender
[00:57:14] <paul_> kb ]
[00:57:15] <Cork> it is what keeps the state of what the user does
[00:57:17] <Cork> and so on
[00:57:21] <screamingbanshee> I think of it as the fuzzy ground between js and html.
[00:57:24] <paul_> oh woops* Document object model.. i was thinking of something else
[00:57:40] <Cork> screamingbanshee: that's what is quite common and really wrong
[00:57:59] <Cork> html is normally not part of the flow, and that is what so commonly is mistaken
[00:58:11] <Cork> html is loaded, and parsed to dom, after that there is no html
[00:58:19] <Cork> its just dom and js
[00:58:44] <Cork> sure you can convert the dom back to html agan, but then you will lose all the state dom has
[00:59:54] <Cork> and also there is nothing fuzzy about dom, if anything the fuzzy part is html
[01:00:00] <screamingbanshee> but you have to be aware of the difference
[01:00:05] <Cork> cause of all it's error corrections
[01:00:26] <Cork> screamingbanshee: if all you do is write simple pages with limited use of js; no
[01:00:30] <Cork> else Y-E-S
[01:00:31] <screamingbanshee> or you'll be sitting there pounding your head when you need to be appending
[01:00:52] <Cork> cause if you think of the dom as html, you will have things breaking
[01:01:04] <Cork> cause it isn't html, it doens't behave like html
[01:01:14] <screamingbanshee> you can't manipulate them the same
[01:01:49] <Cork> ex. grabbing an html tag and adding it on another place copies it
[01:01:58] <Cork> doing the same thing in dom moves the dom element
[01:02:07] <Cork> just as an example
[01:02:13] <Cork> there is a lot of other ones
[01:02:28] <screamingbanshee> better example, insert a new element of a type with an existing event listener
[01:02:50] <Cork> the biggest problem is to think var html = $(target).html(); $(target2).html() will keep ex. form inputs
[01:03:13] <Cork> screamingbanshee: well that is selectors more then dom
[01:03:25] <rooney307> hi! how can i stop runnung function that contains setTimeout and also calls it sel in it self?
[01:03:37] <rooney307> self*
[01:03:38] <Cork> its more like converting a dom element to html and adding it on another part of the page and expecting the event listener to still work
[01:03:45] <paul_> i'm still confused as to what i'm supposed to do with the code, Cork.. lol. i don't mean to be stupid.. i just want to understand it completely
[01:04:00] <Cork> rooney307: keep a handle from what setTimeout sets
[01:04:00] <paul_> am i to leave what you gave me untouched, and then ADD the data hover?
[01:04:23] <Cork> rooney307: window.timer = setTimeout(); clearTimeout(window.timer);
[01:04:40] <Cork> paul_: no replace the this.id with it
[01:05:36] <paul_>  .on('mouseenter', '.swatch', function() { $('#right').addClass$(this).data('hover'); }) ??
[01:05:53] <Cork> paul_: http://jsfiddle.net/GB64n/7/
[01:08:48] <paul_> so that says "when the mouse enters a swatch, then add the class to THIS swatch, of .data(hover) " ?
[01:09:18] <Cork> add the class from data-hover on the element #right
[01:09:41] <Cork> (and the second event listener does the same thing except for remove class)
[01:09:53] <paul_> whats the .data part mean?
[01:10:01] <screamingbanshee> it's an attribute
[01:10:10] <Cork> data basically reads the data- prefix from the attribute
[01:10:19] <Cork> *s list
[01:10:35] <Cork> it is a bit more complicated then that in that it caches the data, and does some parsing
[01:10:38] <rooney307> Cork: sry! cant make that function stop at the end of script http://jsfiddle.net/yZyHD/
[01:10:45] <Cork> but you can replace it with attr('data-hover') if you like
[01:11:40] <Cork> rooney307: you have a race condition
[01:11:52] <rooney307> yes
[01:11:58] <Cork> the time might have already fired when you click it, and the animation is happening
[01:12:08] <Cork> and then killing the timer won't do anything
[01:12:25] <Cork> and as the animation is what starts the next timer...
[01:12:36] <rooney307> how should I remake the function then?
[01:13:11] <Cork> you could check if timer == null and set it to that after you clear the timer
[01:13:19] <Mullazman> Thanks for your replies earlier guys, sorry I was bashing away at it in the background and forgot to check back here haha. Appreciate the input!
[01:13:24] <Cork> and in the fadeIn function not call next if it's null
[01:14:33] <paul_> man, i'm really sorry Cork, but i'm STILL not understanding that line. it's really confusing to me. If i want to give those divs a CSS declaration when the text is being hovered, what do i need to do with that jQuery?
[01:14:56] <Cork> paul_: divs?
[01:15:19] <Cork> ah
[01:15:28] <Cork> i think i miss understood you a bit
[01:15:40] <Cork> you want to have hover on .swatch when the text is hovered?
[01:15:49] <Cork> why not just add it to the swatch instead?
[01:16:36] <xec> because he wants the effect only when the text is hovered (for some reason)
[01:16:39] <paul_> what do u mean add it?
[01:16:39] <Cork> and actually why have the swatch divs at all, just use the a links with display: block;
[01:16:50] <xec> lol Cork, i love you
[01:16:59] <xec> that's what i did in #css ;)
[01:17:12] <xec> well, no in pm actually
[01:17:19] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/GB64n/2/
[01:18:14] <rooney307> Cork: sry! didn' t get u :/
[01:19:13] <Cork> rooney307: clearTimer(window.timer); window.timer = null;
[01:19:19] <paul_> Like I was telling xec in pm; it actually does make more sense the way he did it in that link; it looks better and is simpler. I was just wondering what i'd have to go through if i ran into a problem where i DID need to go up the DOM as such
[01:19:28] <Cork> if(window.timer !== null) { next(++index); }
[01:20:17] <xec> paul_: you can find jquery traversing methods at http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/ -- in this case you just need .parent()
[01:20:43] <motaka2> What is the best book to learn jquery ?
[01:21:12] <rooney307> Cork: it dodn' t stop - here is example http://rtkompanija.lv/test/fotografs/
[01:21:35] <paul_> i tried using the parent, but i definitely had the wrong syntax, cause it was NOT working for me lol
[01:22:28] <Cork> paul_: this is my recommendation http://jsfiddle.net/GB64n/8/
[01:22:42] <Cork> as that is what i suspect you're trying to do
[01:23:26] <Cork> paul_: also p doesn't really belong inside an a tag
[01:24:29] <Cork> rooney307: uh...
[01:24:36] <Cork> do you understand the code your using?
[01:24:45] <Cork> not null around the start call
[01:24:53] <Cork> null in the fadeIn callback
[01:26:14] <paul_> Cork; in regards to update 8; if anything, that's the solution i LEAST want; where the div and text 'highlight' seperately. I would rather they both highlight when mouseover reaches the text, or the way Xec laid it out; as one hover.
[01:26:39] <Cork> paul_: ya, but thats cause you have the p tag
[01:26:49] <Cork> and that's why i said "<Cork> paul_: also p doesn't really belong inside an a tag"
[01:27:49] <xec> Cork: i think he might be referring to http://jsfiddle.net/GB64n/2/ (which i didnt link here)
[01:27:55] <xec> no wait
[01:28:14] <xec> this is what i linked
[01:28:19] <xec> i meant to link http://jsfiddle.net/GB64n/6/ :P
[01:28:52] <xec> /6 is the display: block; on the A i was talking about
[01:29:02] <motaka2> I look for a book which can teach me both javascript and jquery from intermediate level , do you know any ?
[01:30:32] <rooney307> Cork: plz help in jsfiddle
[01:30:44] <rooney307> http://jsfiddle.net/yZyHD/
[01:30:57] <Cork> rooney307: you really need to understand the code your running
[01:31:13] <Cork> if you don't you will be doomed to just copy pasting what others do
[01:31:43] <motaka2> Cork: Help me
[01:32:33] <paul_> Okay, so im going to bed cuz its 1:30am and im tired and hungry, but i do thank Cork and Xec for the help! I've hopefully learned something.. i think i may have :P
[01:32:36] <paul_> gnite guys
[01:32:48] <xec> good luck
[01:32:53] <paul_> thanks
[01:33:05] <paul_> probably haven't heard the last of me :P
[01:33:23] * Cork smacks his head
[01:33:36] <Cork> i've been hunting a weird ul list problem
[01:33:48] <Cork> and just now noticed i wrote il instead of li >_<''
[01:35:10] <Cork> man that's annoying
[01:35:31] <seutje> that's... ill
[01:35:38] <xec> ba-da-tish
[01:35:43] <Cork> i'll even
[01:36:03] <seutje> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YMPAH67f4o
[01:38:44] <Lucaszz> Do you ever seen freeware jqgrid integration with php?
[01:42:01] <seutje> Lucaszz: does this count as php? http://drupal.org/project/jqgrid
[01:44:12] <javalover> hey guys idk what channel to be in for this...but
[01:44:25] <javalover> I have ftp access but am getting 404 error when trying to run pages that worked yesterday....
[01:44:30] <javalover> the ftp server is up & running i don't ge tit
[01:44:41] <Lucaszz> seutje: Problem is how to build mysql query from get string ;p
[01:44:59] <Lucaszz> Im writing it now but I can see that it will takes a lot of time
[01:46:08] <seutje> javalover: maybe the http server isn't ?
[01:46:19] <javalover> if that's the case how would I check?
[01:46:23] <javalover> and what would cause this?
[01:46:37] <javalover> can I fix it? i've been on hold with tech for like 30 min
[01:46:38] <seutje> actually, a 404 suggests the http server is running but can't locate the file
[01:46:50] <javalover> which is weird cuz I tried all kinds of files
[01:47:10] <javalover> i'm not limiting it to the file i UPLOADED to ftp
[01:47:10] <javalover> wtf
[01:47:40] <javalover> heres the thing though
[01:47:47] <javalover> i've been on hold with 1 and 1 for almost 20 min
[01:47:54] <javalover> that's longer than most league of legends que times
[01:47:57] <seutje> iono, are u sure the ftp server/folder corresponds with the http location?
[01:47:59] <javalover> so maybe something is up
[01:48:18] <javalover> uhhhhh I know i uploaded yesterday to same ftp & it worked...
[01:48:23] <javalover> but idk on backend how this all works
[01:48:30] <seutje> oh, yeah... might as well be a server that blew up, hard for me to tell :D
[01:49:04] <javalover> i mean ftp server  is still there
[01:49:05] <javalover> soooo
[01:55:52] <snorti> http://nordquest.eu
[01:55:57] <snorti> some wired problem
[01:56:03] <javalover> ok so
[01:56:09] <snorti> when i move the moise from right to left over the icson
[01:56:10] <javalover> according to 1 & 1, there server did blow up
[01:56:36] <snorti> "move the mouse over the icons, from right to left"
[01:57:34] <javalover> dude snorti wtf is that
[01:57:42] <javalover> dat is bugged yo
[01:57:57] <snorti> javalover: ye it is..
[01:58:06] <snorti> javalover: so any idear?
[01:58:47] <javalover> did you code that?
[01:58:49] <seutje> snorti: oh dear, instead of making these incredible callback chains, try to abstract the logic
[01:59:09] <javalover> yeah listen to seautje he is smart
[01:59:18] <javalover> he even predicted a server blew up, and he was right
[01:59:18] <javalover> lol
[01:59:29] <snorti> :)
[01:59:31] <seutje> like why fade out #navteasbox2 only after #navteasbox1 is done fading?
[01:59:52] <seutje> start them off at the same time, the only thing that has to wait is the fadein
[02:00:03] <snorti> seutje: k
[02:00:31] <seutje> also, instead of targetting them all specifically, try to think of how they relate to one another
[02:00:50] <snorti> seutje: any way to optimize this ?
[02:01:02] <seutje> like when hover over "foo", "bar" should be shown, and all its siblings hidden
[02:01:31] <snorti> can you show me a fiddle?
[02:01:45] <seutje> sure
[02:02:02] <seutje> it won't be the exact same use-case, but I hope I'll be able to explain where I'm getting at
[02:04:44] <snorti> seutje: hm ok
[02:12:11] <timini> I have some function in jQuery called modal() is this part of jquery?
[02:14:22] <adman65> I have a list. I'm using the jquery.scrollTo plugin. Is there a way I can tell the plugin to scroll to an element and put it at the top of the scrollable area ?
[02:20:05] <killinspree> hello I see that jquery versions 1.x are all supported in IE > 6 does this include IE 10
[02:23:49] <seutje> snorti: there, I hope this sort of illustrates where I was getting at: http://jsfiddle.net/mTaZp/1/
[02:24:34] <seutje> I only use 1 single handler for the entire menu, and it could expand with however many items, the code doesn't have to change
[02:24:58] <seutje> cause it threats all elements as equal, aside from the one being triggered
[02:25:55] <seutje> might need some optimisation though
[02:26:02] <snorti> seutje: thx m8
[02:26:13] <snorti> i think this helps me
[02:26:15] <seutje> like placing the tabs absolute whilst fading out
[02:26:57] <seutje> but I just wanted to show u the basic idea of treating elements relative to eachother instead of fixed to an ID or whatnot
[02:28:27] <seutje> granted, pinning it to IDs is more performant for the DOM lookup, but this way I narrow my traversal down to a small piece of the DOM, to which I cached  a reference beforehand
[02:29:53] <veganista> can i use .on() like i used to use .live() or do i need to use the .delegate method to bind to all future elements? I was woring on the assumption that .on() did this but im not sure it does.
[02:31:33] <seutje> veganista: on works differently from live, it's closer to how delegate works, except the arguments are in a different order iirc
[02:32:48] <seutje> $('.foo').live('click', fn); is effectively $(document).on('click', '.foo', fn) or $(document).delegate('.foo', 'click', fn) I think
[02:34:54] <veganista> seutje: after having read the docs am i right in thinking tha this will bind to all furture elements? $('body a.button').on('click', function(){});
[02:35:06] <seutje> nope
[02:35:25] <seutje> $('body').on('click', 'a.button', function(){})
[02:35:36] <veganista> ahh, thanks alot
[02:35:58] <seutje> basically: $(shit-that-wont-change).on(events, shit-that-might-change, function)
[02:36:18] <veganista> Why isn't it said like that in the manual?
[02:36:21] <seutje> but usually u wanna narrow down the "shit-that-wont-change"
[02:36:29] <seutje> cause "shit" is considered offensive?
[02:36:33] <veganista> so the closest ancestor
[02:37:19] <veganista> cheers seutje, you really know your shit
[02:37:49] <seutje> veganista: it's explained rather in-depth at http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events

[02:45:26] <jonkristian_wrk> with the form validation from bassistance, can i add rules and messages to the form itself, instead of defining in js. This is because I have lots of different forms it will be hard to keep track of each and one in my js file.

[02:49:19] <kausalya> Hey all , is it possible for AJAX on a HTTP site to do a POST request on a different https URL (other site i.e different Domain) ? I am reading about CORS is it relevant? Can you suggest where should I look.
[02:51:29] <killer`toaster> Hey everyone, I'm looking for a solution to display jQuery/AJAX tables with filters and sortable columns. I've found several options but I'd like to know if the masters here could recommend one!
[02:52:21] * theresajayne_ looks around trying to find the "Masters"
[02:52:23] <kausalya> Hey all , is it possible for AJAX on a HTTP site to do a POST request on a different https URL (other site i.e different Domain) ? I am reading about CORS is it relevant? Can you suggest where should I look?
[02:52:26] <killer`toaster> kausalya: I'm not sure, I only know you cannot do it on things like Facebook apps, if that's any help
[02:53:05] <theresajayne_> kausalya I do posts from ajax all the time
[02:53:22] <theresajayne_> not sure about cross site posts though
[02:53:49] <kausalya> theresajayne_, I am trying cross site post , and its eating my head like anything
[02:53:51] <killer`toaster> I had a form in a tab on a client's Facebook page and when I tried to POST to a different domain, it just silently failed
[02:54:11] <kausalya> rails
[02:54:13] <theresajayne_> usually we use a hidden form and javascript force a post
[02:54:40] <killer`toaster> I was justing $.ajax, maybe there's another way
[02:55:02] <killer`toaster> using*
[02:55:23] <theresajayne_> what error are you having
[02:55:26] <killer`toaster> So does anyone know about a jQuery/AJAX table solution? :)
[02:55:31] <theresajayne_> $.post({
[02:55:42] <kraucrow> doesn't do cross domain
[02:55:48] <kraucrow> ajax post
[02:56:12] <kausalya> kraucrow, then is there any other way ?
[02:56:28] <kraucrow> post to the same domain
[02:56:45] <kraucrow> implement gateway on that domain
[02:56:51] <killer`toaster> kausalya: you could post to the same domain and then use something like PHP's curl to post to the other domain
[02:57:04] <kausalya> kraucrow, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing is it not what I should look into?
[02:57:09] <Thoams> Hi, http://codepad.org/heveLhFG - can't for the life of me get my json into the ajax call... read somewhere that it's because the encoding isn't ending up correct, and the workaround is to surround your json string with ' ' - this works, see toast:biscuit comment. Halp!
[02:59:01] <kraucrow> kausalya: i'm not sure bout that.
[02:59:54] <kausalya> kraucrow, thanks :) killer`toaster that is the fall back option I was trying to avoid that .
[03:08:58] <sylock> Hello guys. I have a recurrent problem : when I have a lot of content to process (data coming from an ajax call) and then I have to draw them, I tried to hide the content being process (with visibility: hidden) while the active div show an animated gif to tell the user to wait.
[03:09:49] <sylock> the problem is : when I do a $("#mycontent_div").css('visibility', 'visible'); the browser is freezing some seconds then I get everything drawn
[03:10:02] <sylock> is there a better way for handling such situation?
[03:11:16] <killer`toaster> sylock: maybe show()?
[03:12:41] <sylock> show() doesn't work when visibility is set to hidden
[03:12:49] <sylock> it only works with display: None
[03:13:51] <killer`toaster> Right. But maybe that way it wouldn't freeze the browser?
[03:23:00] <xfire> help
[03:23:24] <montyr> var firstpost = $('div[guidedhelpid="streamcontent"]:first-child'); <-- does that look right to you?
[03:28:16] <Cork> montyr: careful with :first-child
[03:28:49] <Cork> as it will only first the exact first child, not first child that matches the guidedhelpid attribute (btw you should prefix that attribute)
[03:30:44] <montyr> prefix what? :)
[03:30:54] <Cork> guidedhelpid
[03:31:08] <Cork> you should never have unprefixed none standard attributes on the dom
[03:31:10] <Cork> use data-guidedhelpid
[03:31:13] <montyr> google named it that way
[03:31:18] <Cork> ...
[03:31:22] <Cork> idiots...
[03:31:34] <montyr> i am trying to get teh first post from a gplus stream
[03:31:39] <Cork> ok
[03:31:54] <Cork> ok$('div[guidedhelpid="streamcontent"]').first();
[03:32:05] <montyr> what is the first child of the third child of the element that has the guidedhelpid streamcontent :9
[03:32:45] <Cork> all i meant is that :first-child has a lot of extra effects that is easy to miss
[03:33:22] <Cork> what i meant is that that selector wouldn't match this <div><h3></h3><div guidedhelpid="streamcontent"></div></div>
[03:33:40] <Cork> cause <div guidedhelpid="streamcontent"></div> isn't the first child of the parent
[03:36:03] <montyr> k k
[03:49:55] <montyr> i am to stupid.. what would be the best way to select element->third-child->first-child
[03:50:33] <montyr> a little like this maybe? | var stream = $('div[guidedhelpid="streamcontent"]:nth-child(3):first-child');
[03:58:58] <CodaBottle> I am learning jquery, and have a question regarding scrolling. I have set up a table of contents at the top of the page with an anchor to each subheading in the article.

[04:05:29] <theresajayne_> its always coming back as 0 when i know 1 is being sent.
[04:05:49] <fabioportieri> use console.log instead of alert
[04:06:30] <Cork> theresajayne_: and how do you know its sent?
[04:06:44] <Cork> can you see the value in the browser console?

[04:07:46] <kausalya> Hey guys I am getting this error as a response to my post request https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5488048 , please tell me what I am doing wrong
[04:08:22] <Cork> kausalya: run a normal jquery lib (as in not minimized)
[04:08:48] <theresajayne_> is there anyway to get the number value of a string or will it auto box?
[04:09:29] <Cork> you mean the charCode?
[04:09:47] <Cork> or rather ascii code?
[04:09:57] <kausalya> Cork, did that now ?
[04:10:15] <Cork> kausalya: did what now?
[04:10:45] <theresajayne_> Cork as in var data = "2";   i want the numeric value in another variable or will it auto box ie if(data <0)

[04:12:14] <Changa> Hello, I have a slide show in my home page, but when the transition happens, the image is off position - any idea what's causing this? -> http://www.edizarca.com/karpaz/
[04:12:36] <kausalya> Cork, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5488073
[04:13:02] <Cork> kausalya: and what is the error?
[04:13:21] <kausalya> Cork, Resource failed to load
[04:13:49] <Cork> ah
[04:14:04] <Cork> kausalya: are you doing ajax cross domain?
[04:14:20] <kausalya> Cork, yes
[04:14:29] <Cork> then that's what happens
[04:14:33] <Cork> the browser is blocking you
[04:15:22] <kausalya> Cork, I have added Access control allow origin * on the server
[04:15:52] <Cork> kausalya: looks like you have a problem with the header in that cause
[04:16:47] <kausalya> Cork let me check and get back to you, thanks a ton
[04:17:27] <kausalya> Cork, you mean the request headers right ?
[04:17:38] <Cork> no, response header
[04:18:11] <Cork> the response header from the ajax call is what says if the ajax call is allowed
[04:18:52] <kausalya> Cork, how do I change or check those , I am new to js
[04:19:10] <Cork> kausalya: the browser console net/network tab
[04:19:29] <caddoo> What is the best way to listen for changes of an array inside a jquery widget
[04:19:36] <caddoo> I'm writing the widget myself so have full access to the code
[04:19:48] <Cork> caddoo: you can't listen for a change on an array
[04:19:57] <Cork> not cross browser at least
[04:20:27] <caddoo> ok Cork so its up to me to call the method I want to call manually each time I update it
[04:20:30] <Cork> (there are sevelar ways to do it in modern js implementations)
[04:20:38] <Cork> yes
[04:20:55] <Cork> simplest is to have the widget have an internal array, and have a function to change it
[04:21:12] <Cork> so you give the array to the function and it changes the internal array
[04:21:27] <kausalya> Cork now it says "load cancelled" but gets status as 200 OK, also I get no response from server
[04:21:44] <Cork> uh
[04:21:53] <Cork> so something is calling abort...
[04:22:00] <Cork> not sure what would trigger that
[04:22:18] <Cork> never seen it, sorry
[04:24:25] <kausalya> Cork sometimes it says load cancelled sometimes it says resource failed to load https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5488115
[04:24:53] <caddoo> Cork inside my widget I'm using this._trigger('update_array') in the method that modifies the array, then in my _create I have " this._on(this, function(){ update_array: 'test' }); " but with no luck.
[04:25:03] <Cork> are you doing a post?
[04:25:11] <Cork> kausalya: `
[04:25:14] <Cork> *^
[04:25:27] <kausalya> Cork, yes
[04:25:35] <Cork> ok, that explains everything
[04:25:46] <Cork> if you do a post the browser does an options call to the server
[04:26:01] <Cork> and if it doesn't get an answer it takes that as the post isn't allowed
[04:26:25] <Cork> so that the OPTIONS call fails triggers that the POST call is canceled
[04:26:51] <Cork> the server has to answer the OPTIONS call for the post to happen
[04:28:27] <kausalya> Cork thanks a ton, I am looking into it now, checking how to response to OPTIONS if I get stuck I will disturb you again, thanks!!
[04:29:18] <Cork> kausalya: basically cross domain ajax is a mess and it's normally just sumpler to proxy it
[04:29:23] <ahandy> I have a question. Is there any way I can check if a key sequence was pressed? for example "yhn" or whatever and do a function if it was?
[04:30:26] <Cork> you would have to catch keydown
[04:30:33] <Cork> stor what keys has keydown
[04:30:39] <Cork> and clear that on keyup
[04:30:59] <kausalya> Cork I am trying to tell that to my boss, I am new to js so wanted to give it a try and learned a lot while at it, thanks for helping out
[04:31:40] <Cork> kausalya: crossdomain get calls is find (you can always fallback to jsonp if everything else fails)
[04:31:44] <Cork> but post isn't fun
[04:31:57] <Cork> *get calls is fine
[04:35:58] <caddoo> These two methods are inside a jQuery widget of mine
[04:35:59] <caddoo> http://paste.ubuntu.com/5618888/
[04:36:21] <caddoo> Shouldn't this._trigger run the function update_array, or have i misunderstood how widget events work
[04:36:58] <Cork> no
[04:37:15] <Cork> _trigger is for events and passed in callbacks
[04:39:00] <caddoo> ok Cork I'm trying to make update_array an event, how would I do that
[04:39:14] <Cork> your using the widgetfactory?
[04:39:40] <Cork> *you're
[04:39:53] <seutje> thanks
[04:39:58] <Cork> heh
[04:40:10] <seutje> I cringed, I'm sorry, ok?
[04:40:15] <caddoo> yes Cork
[04:40:34] <Cork> caddoo: create the function in the default for the option object
[04:41:56] <caddoo> ah perfect Cork thanks
[04:42:00] <Cork> if you don't want it user overridable you shouldn't be doing it that way
[05:07:05] <anli> How do I make an image reload itself? It uses if-modified-since so "cache busting" should not be needed, should it?
[05:07:34] <stygyan> hola niños y niñas
[05:15:55] <Cork> anli: add a timestamp at the end of the url
[05:16:17] <Cork> http://example.com/path/file.img?285791275
[05:16:33] <anli> I cannot do that, I must utilize caching
[05:16:51] <anli> The image should only be fetched from the server if it has been modified
[05:16:53] <Cork> ah, so you want to restart an animation?
[05:17:10] <anli> If I upload an image to the file bank, the image has its modified field updated
[05:17:36] <Cork> anli: if i remember correctly the browser has a min check time
[05:17:56] <Cork> but it should make calls to the server to check the header
[05:18:06] <anli> Hm, ok, if I set Expires to the past, will the browser skip using If-Modified-Since?
[05:19:31] <Cork> the server sets Last-Modified or Expires
[05:19:48] <Cork> If Expires haven't passed the browser won't check again
[05:20:46] <Cork> the date or Last-Modified from the request that gave the browser the original image is used in the next call to see if it should update the cache
[05:21:26] <Cork> it saves the data length (only a 304 header), but you still get the latency from doing the net call
[05:21:57] <Cork> so if the image is small, the 304 header is pointless as the entire image would fit in the response package anyway
[05:25:43] <anli> I set Last-Modified programmatically
[05:25:51] <anli> And check If-Last-Modified manually
[05:26:07] <anli> But if the browser does not send a request, that will become tricky
[05:26:36] <anli> We need to replace images, small or not sometimes
[05:27:36] <Cork> a common solution is to add a timestamp to the end of the url like i said
[05:27:49] <Cork> and then modify it when the image/css/js has changed
[05:28:00] <Cork> that way you control when it should be fetched again
[05:30:06] <anli> Cool, I did not have to add timestamps, just setting Expires to the past and use If-Modified-Since solves the problems
[05:30:35] <anli> We have a lot of huge images that will never be sent that much using this solution
[05:42:57] <Shucky> hi all
[05:44:52] <atan> Is there a reason I can't do this? $("td a:visited").parent("tr").remove();
[05:46:45] <anli> closest('tr') instead of parent('tr')
[05:46:46] <Shucky> i'm looking for a plugin to have a website with horizontal scroll using link or mouse or key but without scrollbar
[05:46:52] <anli> @atan
[05:47:20] <Cork> ya, parent only checks if the direct parent matches the selector
[05:47:33] <Cork> of not it doesn't return anything
[05:48:01] <atan> Hmm, well I don't know where I'm going wrong. I have a table and I want to ditch any rows where the links have been clicked onload... $(document).ready(function() { $("a:visited").closest('tr').remove(); }); isn't doing that though
[05:48:23] <Cork> ah :visited
[05:48:36] <Cork> atan: modern browsers don't allow js to match visited
[05:48:44] <atan> Doh!
[05:48:49] <Cork> it leaks users browsing histiry
[05:48:56] <Cork> history even
[05:48:57] <atan> Yeah, I remember that one...
[05:49:00] <anli> :)
[05:49:09] <anli> Yeah, true, it would be a security problem
[05:49:13] <atan> How could I do this? *must* I keep track of it on the server before output?
[05:49:35] <Cork> atan: you can hide the link but not the tr
[05:50:16] <Cork> actually i don't even thing display: none is allowed on :visited
[05:50:20] <royalty> does javascript get confused if you give it a url starting from the sites root?
[05:50:24] <royalty> or the servers root
[05:50:26] <royalty> rather
[05:50:26] <atan> So it seems. Can't change the size of the text, drat!
[05:50:32] <royalty> because it seems to be
[05:50:44] <Cork> royalty: javascript don't care, browsers do
[05:51:19] <Cork> http(s)://domain.com/path/file.ext is full fqdn url
[05:51:31] <royalty> Cork: so usually calls need to be made starting from the web or public html directory?
[05:51:39] <Cork> /domain.com/path/file.ext is protocol less same thing
[05:51:39] <b-ot> Cork: memorised “domain.com/path/file.ext”.
[05:51:45] <Cork> opps
[05:51:48] <Cork> //domain.com/path/file.ext is protocol less same thing
[05:52:05] <Cork> /path/file.ext is an absolute path
[05:52:05] <b-ot> Cork: memorised “path/file.ext”.
[05:52:18] <Cork> and path/file.ext is a relative path
[05:52:36] <Cork> b-ot: forget path/file.ext
[05:52:45] <eager> atan: what if you register a variable if they click $('td a'), and then decide what to do based on that variable?
[05:53:01] <Cork> eager: and page reloads?
[05:53:16] <royalty> Cork: what should the path be relative to? Where the javascript is?
[05:53:21] <eager> oh, well, indeed
[05:53:36] <Cork> royalty: the currently loaded page
[05:54:06] <royalty> Cork: hmm okay
[05:54:52] <sacrilicious> good morning
[05:55:22] <eager> Cork: how about trying to use localstorage? (I have never, but it seems a suitable case for it) (although might turn out to be overkill for such a simple need)
[05:55:34] <sacrilicious> http://link.com/index.php?action=123 - how do i get the last "123" parameters in javascript ?
[06:00:21] <philhutchinson> function getURLParameter(name) { return decodeURI((RegExp(name + '=' + '(.+?)(&|$)').exec(location.search)||[,null])[1]); }
[06:00:30] <caddoo> Inside my widget factory I have this event in my options, http://paste.ubuntu.com/5619070/ , it all works except that I can't access 'this._selected' even though it exists. How would I?
[06:00:39] <philhutchinson> then use getURLParameter("action");
[06:01:55] <bluelf> I am trying to do a cross domain post and its passing on some browsers and failing on some I am not able to understand why it is passing on chrome and failing on ff . What am I missing ? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5488539
[06:02:30] <philhutchinson> hmm caddoo: $(this)._selected ?
[06:02:48] <caddoo> bluelf just a guess but doesn't it need to be jsonp rather than json?
[06:03:29] <philhutchinson> bluelf: I had the same issue on FF, it doesnt seem to work without the access string set to allow all
[06:03:35] <eager> sacrilicious: google [ javascript getUrlVars ]
[06:03:38] <philhutchinson> I just used a proxy
[06:03:57] <caddoo> nope philhutchinson, $(this) seems to be a jQuery object of the element that I called the widget from.
[06:04:16] <philhutchinson> and you cant access it from there?
[06:04:25] <caddoo> I want to access the widget
[06:04:46] <caddoo> in normal methods I can just do this.whatever, But I think because it's an event the context has changed.
[06:05:33] <bluelf> philhutchinson, how do I set that, I am sorry I am very new to JS
[06:06:43] <philhutchinson> yea thats why i thought you could access it from the jquery object caddoo
[06:06:47] <philhutchinson> hmm
[06:07:30] <philhutchinson> bluelf: see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/298745/how-do-i-send-a-cross-domain-post-request-via-javascript
[06:12:47] <royalty> how do i debug the correct url to give the ajax request
[06:12:59] <royalty> it is working when i just have the files on the site root
[06:13:18] <royalty> I mean the web root
[06:13:27] <royalty> it is just 'whatever.php'
[06:13:47] <royalty> but the minute I move it I can't seem to get the correct url for it
[06:14:08] <deepy> pastebin failing code and the url you moved it to?
[06:16:41] <royalty> deepy: http://pastebin.com/qTizvmK6
[06:16:49] <royalty> deepy: my code needs some srs cleaning up
[06:16:54] <royalty> deepy:heh
[06:21:49] <timini> is there a jquery search method for returning one element instead of an array of elements?
[06:22:38] <timini> like $('#login a') returns a list of elements, wheras I only want to select the first element
[06:23:53] <royalty> timini: you could always do $('#login a')[0] I believe
[06:26:07] <royalty> deepy: have any insight?
[06:34:26] <kba> when using draggable UI, is it possible to see where the draggable item is coming from in the drop event?
[06:35:09] <kba> According to the API http://api.jqueryui.com/droppable/#event-drop we know that ui.draggable cointains the element being dragged and this will in the context be the element that the draggable element is being dropped onto.
[06:35:14] <kba> How do I know where the element came from?
[06:35:45] <roswell> kba, do you mean an element's parent?
[06:35:54] <kba> No
[06:36:14] <kba> Let's say I have 2 divs, A and B. I have an element E in A. Now, I drag this element to B.
[06:36:42] <kba> in the context of the drop event, "this" will refer to B. "draggable" will refer to E.
[06:36:49] <kba> I want to get A.
[06:37:01] <kba> You follow?
[06:38:24] <roswell> kba, sort of, i guess. A is still parent of E in this case, yet it's .ui-draggable
[06:40:05] <kba> roswell: Oh, I see. I thought that E had already been put into B, so E's parent would be B.
[06:40:12] <kba> But you're right, E's parent is in fact still A.
[06:40:15] <kba> Thank you, roswell
[06:40:21] <roswell> right, so the selector is quite straightforward
[06:40:37] <kba> Indeed it is
[06:40:58] <roswell> yw )
[06:41:41] <anew> #help
[06:41:44] <anew> oops
[06:56:50] <flagomes> hi everybody
[06:57:33] <flagomes> can someone help me please?
[06:58:08] <flagomes> need to understand how to work with jquery and. net
[07:09:59] <royalty> okay
[07:10:07] <royalty> my javascript is in inline script tags
[07:10:13] <royalty> where is the relative path in this case
[07:10:23] <royalty> is it to the file the javascript resides in?
[07:10:26] <royalty> I don't get it
[07:10:31] <royalty> this is driving me crazy
[07:10:40] <ripthejacker> need help with jquery mobile
[07:10:47] <tubbo> royalty: that doesn't make sense
[07:10:56] <tubbo> royalty: what do you mean by "relative file"?
[07:11:13] <ripthejacker> how can i specify the page content height to be 100% - header and footer?
[07:11:47] <ripthejacker> both , header and footer have data-position='fixed'
[07:12:12] <momomomomo> Morning all ;)
[07:12:15] <royalty> tubbo: I said relative path? I want to run an ajax request
[07:12:41] <NoiseEee> royalty: you're asking about the path to the page you're requesting via ajax?
[07:12:51] <royalty> tubbo: it works if I have the file directly in the web folder I can just say url : 'test-me2.php'
[07:13:01] <royalty> NoiseEee: yeah
[07:13:07] <NoiseEee> royalty: the answer is don't use relative paths.
[07:13:18] <NoiseEee> royalty: "/path/to/file.php"
[07:13:25] <NoiseEee> or just "/file.php" whatever it is
[07:13:28] <momomomomo> Actuall, a JS question this morning for you all: Does anyone make use of JS Lazy Loading functions? I'm thinking of using them for a massive select collection that needs to be changed via JS, but I'm seeing conflicting thoughts on the interwebs ( http://imbuzu.wordpress.com/2012/11/03/the-lazy-function-declaration-pattern-javascript/ ); not only to mention that it's going to be tougher to maintain
[07:13:31] <harpal> I have http://jsfiddle.net/eGrnY/ code. I would like to move arrow in x axis if mouse is over to my one div. how to achieve that??
[07:13:48] <royalty> NoiseEee: where is that from though?
[07:14:07] <NoiseEee> royalty: the document root of your server
[07:14:19] <NoiseEee> royalty: however you set it up in apache or iis or what have you
[07:14:20] <ripthejacker> right now the page contents are going behind the footer and I don't want that.
[07:14:40] <quietschie> hi, is there a function to find the next element that matches a selector, without regarding the html tree-structure?
[07:14:48] <royalty> NoiseEee: I have tried both the web folder of the server and the root folder. Neither seem to work
[07:16:02] <NoiseEee> royalty: figure it out!
[07:16:29] <royalty> NoiseEee: I'm trying!
[07:16:38] <NoiseEee> royalty: if they don't work, you don't have the correct path.  what would you type in your browser to get to that URL?
[07:18:18] <royalty> NoiseEee: it 404s when I try to do it via browser
[07:18:40] <NoiseEee> then again, you're not hitting the right file / wrong path.
[07:18:41] <royalty> NoiseEee: /app/design/frontend/default/richard/template/drill_down/model.php
[07:19:03] <NoiseEee> well if you're using a php framework, follow those routing instructions etc
[07:19:32] <royalty> routing instructions?
[07:19:46] <harpal> royalty: Are you using magento framework? As you cant directly access any files under app directory
[07:19:58] <royalty> harpal: yes I am
[07:20:04] <royalty> harpal: oh wow
[07:20:16] <quietschie> hi, is there a function to find the next element that matches a selector, without regarding the html tree-structure?
[07:20:17] <royalty> harpal: What folder should I put them in to access them?
[07:21:07] <royalty> harpal: would it work if I put them in the skin directory?
[07:21:30] <royalty> man this sucks lol
[07:22:11] <RNT> hi, can somebody help me with this pice of code please?
[07:22:25] <RNT> http://pastebin.com/a1RDb58n
[07:23:30] <harpal> royalty: if you are using magento function then you have to initialize magento framework on your php file and then you can use that code. you can put it at document root. for more help go to #magento
[07:24:20] <royalty> harpal: yeah but I was trying to package all the files together...
[07:24:23] <royalty> harpal: oh well
[07:24:36] <royalty> harpal: I'll just leave it dirty and forget about it
[07:24:38] <quietschie> RNT: can't u use onSelect?
[07:24:50] <royalty> RNT: it is on change buddy
[07:25:14] <royalty> RNT: you can get this.value on change
[07:25:40] <RNT> hmm, hardly, because is inside another jquery made by someboody else...
[07:25:41] <RNT> :(
[07:26:15] <RNT> and anyway, i need that value in all the time, not only "on change"
[07:26:30] <RNT> here is my test page:
[07:26:31] <RNT> http://rntplayer.com/test3.php
[07:27:08] <quietschie> RNT: you can apply the function and the handler via jQuery
[07:27:33] <RNT> how?
[07:27:55] <RNT> i don't know so much about jquerry/java
[07:28:21] <quietschie> find the element in html and add your script to it
[07:28:47] <quietschie> you can basically manipulate anything with jquery
[07:29:04] <RNT> i'm thinking to use a cycle "for" to find the "selected" element, but i don't know how to find the refference
[07:29:22] <RNT> i tryed, but i'm not able...
[07:29:32] <quietschie> why can't u use onSelect?
[07:29:41] <RNT> var sel = document.getElementbyId("sel_2");
[07:29:41] <RNT> alert(sel);
[07:29:50] <RNT> returns nthing
[07:29:52] <RNT> :(
[07:30:06] <fabioportieri> why don't you use jquery for that
[07:30:29] <BillCriswell> RNT: do alert( $('#sel_2 option:selected').val() );
[07:30:43] <RNT> quicksilver, because that stuff is inside an another compressed jquerry, i can't see wat's in it
[07:30:52] <BillCriswell> Well, you don't need the option:selected part actually, not sure why I typed that.
[07:31:32] <quietschie> $(".selector").change(function(e){alert(e);});
[07:31:42] <quietschie> sth like that should do
[07:32:14] <RNT> :-?
[07:32:35] <RNT> is good, but not enough
[07:32:37] <RNT> :-?
[07:33:48] <RNT> quietschie, that function won't work
[07:33:56] <harpal> I have http://jsfiddle.net/eGrnY/ code. I would like to move arrow in x axis if mouse is over to my one div. how to achieve that?? problem is that it must move within specific area only.
[07:35:32] <quietschie> RNT: does http://api.jquery.com/change/ help you?
[07:36:19] <RNT> quietschie, wait a sec, i will explain you...
[07:37:07] <royalty> harpal: thanks by the way
[07:38:28] <RNT> quicksilver, that "onselect" is a part of dropdown menu from here: http://www.marghoobsuleman.com/mywork/jcomponents/image-dropdown/samples/index.html
[07:38:34] <harpal> royalty: YW :D
[07:39:20] <RNT> it has it's own jquerry somewhere in a yadayada.js, i can not modify it, because i don't know how is made,
[07:40:09] <RNT> and, i need taht value of the "selected" element of dropdown box in all the time, not only when it changes
[07:41:11] <RNT> me, i build only the "li" for that dropdown box, after that "yadayada.js" take cares of rest
[07:42:31] <sfdcNoob> how do u get touch scroll effect? like on iPhone?
[07:42:55] <caddoo> Is there a better way to loop LI elements in a UL so that it always gets the correct order?
[07:43:12] <caddoo> I'm using $.each(myul.children('li') .. at the moment and the order keeps changing
[07:43:26] <RNT> now, what i need, when i click onanother element (not that "li"), my js taking the value of "selected" "li"
[07:44:56] <BillCriswell> RNT: Tell me what you need in less than 2 sentences.
[07:45:14] <caddoo> ah no worries was jquery ui causing me issues
[07:45:15] <RNT> :)))
[07:45:44] <quietschie> RNT: try jQuery(".ddTitleText ").change(function(e){console.log(e.target);});
[07:47:01] <RNT> when i click on ".listElement" to get the value of "selected" inside it's inner ",.selector" class
[07:48:11] <RNT> quietschie, i don't know how to use that, where to put it?
[07:48:43] <RNT> again, the original test page is http://rntplayer.com/test3.php
[07:48:54] <quietschie> what is the source that you are modifying?
[07:49:23] <RNT> is no any source, i'm trying to write my own code
[07:49:35] <quietschie> php file?
[07:49:42] <quietschie> or js file?
[07:49:49] <RNT> contains some php, but don't worry about
[07:50:34] <RNT> see the page source
[07:50:46] <BillCriswell> RNT: $('li').on('click', function(){ var selectValue = $(this).find('select').val(); }); ?
[07:51:11] <RNT> :-?
[07:51:14] <RNT> let me try
[07:51:23] <RNT> ahh, not
[07:51:33] <RNT> because is another "li"
[07:51:35] <RNT> :(
[07:51:50] <BillCriswell> Where is the li relative to the li you click on?
[07:52:06] <quietschie> put it between $(document).ready(function() { and });
[07:52:23] <RNT> i click on "parent" "li" of another "child" "li"
[07:52:33] <RNT> i need the value of "child"
[07:53:21] <quietschie> btw, can anyone tell me please: is there a function to find the next element that matches a selector, without regarding the html tree-structure?
[07:53:25] <BillCriswell> I'm getting "BillCriswell: 1" in the alert
[07:54:11] <caddoo> question about the sortable plugin from jquery ui, on the out event is it possible to get the order the li was in the list
[07:54:20] <RNT> yes, but that's because i pup a static "li" refference in the alert,
[07:54:22] <caddoo> whether it was the 3rd child, 4th child etc
[07:54:27] <RNT> i need a dynamic one
[07:54:40] <RNT> what you said before, is a good begginning
[07:55:01] <RNT> i think we can build up a dynamic refference to that element
[07:55:33] <RNT> alert('BillCriswell:' +  $('#sel_2 option:selected').val() );
[07:56:02] <rntf> rema11
[07:56:14] <BillCriswell> RNT: When you click a listElement you want the value of the select inside of it?
[07:56:14] <RNT> #sel_2 is static, in reality, should be #sel_1, #sel_2, etc
[07:56:40] <RNT> BillCriswell, no, the value of another element
[07:56:55] <BillCriswell> What is the other element?
[07:56:57] <RNT> or, i don't know how to say
[07:57:00] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[07:57:19] <RNT> look here:
[07:57:20] <RNT> http://pastebin.com/a1RDb58n
[07:57:57] <RNT> when i click on "li .listElement" i want <option "selected" ... > value
[07:58:24] <RNT> cid are variables
[07:59:44] <BillCriswell> quietschie: $('.listElement').on('click', function(){ var $selectedOption = $(this).find('select option:selected'); console.log($selectedOption.data('image')); });
[08:00:21] <quietschie> tells me what?
[08:00:47] <BillCriswell> The selected option's data-image attribute.
[08:00:57] <BillCriswell> When you click the li
[08:02:33] <RNT> i don't know how to deal with  console.log
[08:02:47] <RNT> i put your code in, but nothing happens
[08:03:08] <BillCriswell> Open up your developer console, firebug or chrome developers tools
[08:03:27] <RNT> how?
[08:03:29] <RNT> :(
[08:03:46] <BillCriswell> What browser?
[08:03:53] <BillCriswell> PS: Google can answer this way faster than me.
[08:04:17] <RNT> ok, i openit in chrome
[08:04:28] <delboy1978uk> anyone here good with .autocomplete() ? i have it on my page but the actual suggestions dont appear!! the json is showing in the developer tools network tab so the data has loaded :-s
[08:05:23] <delboy1978uk> i actually have another 2 autocompletes on the same page so i really dont know why this one doesnt want to play :-(
[08:06:23] <fabioportieri> http://snag.gy/Ce0N7.jpg  <-- how would you solve that?
[08:07:53] <caddoo> What could be causing the 'sortable' event 'out' to be called when I'm not dragging the LI outside the UL?
[08:08:00] <BillCriswell> RNT: http://jsbin.com/ubebur/1/edit this help?
[08:08:02] <caddoo> called/fired
[08:10:24] <BillCriswell> fabioportieri: Do you have a live example of that? Going to the URL but can't replicate it.
[08:10:33] <RNT> BillCriswell, you are my hero!
[08:10:46] <delboy1978uk> can anyone help here? working on this crazy web site http://www.allagents.co.uk/find-staff   try typing mark into the search box, and you'll see the json is coming through, but no suggestions appearing?
[08:10:46] <RNT> thank you very much :)
[08:10:47] <BillCriswell> quicksilver: Dammit. Thought I was talking to RNT haha
[08:10:52] <BillCriswell> Sorry about that.
[08:10:57] <BillCriswell> RNT: Welcome!
[08:11:07] <quicksilver> :)
[08:11:29] <BillCriswell> Did it again.
[08:11:33] <BillCriswell> I quit IRC.
[08:11:53] <Areckx> Can someone help me with this? I really need this fixed for a client. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16139633/nivo-slider-thumbnail-loading-incorrect-images
[08:12:02] <fabioportieri> BillCriswell: yes the live example is twitter bootstrap site but i have a clean testcase if you want it
[08:12:26] <fabioportieri> BillCriswell: it's hard to reproduce if you don't know it you have to shrink the browser and zoom in to the max
[08:12:51] <BillCriswell> Oh nice, FireFox lets me shrink below 400px in OSX.
[08:12:56] <fabioportieri> i'm asking this in #css for days but no luck
[08:13:08] <fabioportieri> it's hard to make ppl notice it
[08:13:30] <fabioportieri> BillCriswell: the testcase: http://pastie.org/pastes/7743247/reply
[08:15:41] <delboy1978uk> nivo slider sucks Areckx. why not use the bootstrap carousel? much much better
[08:16:00] <BillCriswell> Ill be back.
[08:16:11] <fabioportieri> i believe in you BillCriswell
[08:16:30] <Areckx> delboy1978uk:  I've already put several hours into getting this one to work. I just need this one thing working
[08:16:42] <fabioportieri> why nivo slider sucks? :/
[08:17:20] <Areckx> this client is behind on payments already
[08:18:41] <Areckx> unless there is an easy way to switch out plugins, I need to stick with nivo
[08:19:01] <NoiseEee> Areckx: it'd probably take you quicker to just find a new slider. i find https://github.com/woothemes/FlexSlider pretty decent
[08:19:11] <NoiseEee> there's a zillion out there
[08:19:38] <NoiseEee> it shouldn't take you longer than an hour or two to figure it out, which beats the 24+ hours you've spent trying to solve Nivo's, which is a NIVO problem and not a jquery one
[08:19:59] <Areckx> NoiseEee:  alright I'll try flex
[08:22:53] <clov3r> delboy1978uk: get a weird error from the bootstrap.js: typeerror: $(..).on is not a function
[08:23:30] <clov3r> line 292 of the bootstrap js
[08:23:59] <clov3r> not sure why that would be, but that's what the console tells me
[08:24:29] <clov3r> did notice a typo "Enter the name of tGhe agent you are looking for"
[08:25:02] <diadem> Can anyone recommend a good custom scrollbar tool?
[08:26:42] <Areckx> I'll let you know if I run into any problems implementing flex, I will try my best to follow the instructions
[08:28:37] <caddoo> When using sortable with jQuery UI can I make it clone when its moved to another list rather than just move it out
[08:28:43] <caddoo> I want the original list to remain intact
[08:28:54] <caddoo> I don't want the ability to reorder the original list
[08:34:34] <BillCriswell> Ok, meetings are terrible.
[08:43:39] <mpereira> the swipe demo page at the jquery mobile official website is broken: http://ompldr.org/vaTlzYg
[08:46:05] <mpereira> any staff here?
[08:50:50] <ajpiano> mpereira: what did you click on that took you to that demo
[08:54:07] <ajpiano> mpereira: just report it here, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile
[08:54:27] <Areckx> so I am trying to implement this, NoiseEee  http://flexslider.woothemes.com/basic-carousel.html
[08:55:25] <Areckx> it's not really working, is there something wrong with my placement of the code? http://paste.ubuntu.com/5619529/
[08:56:03] <Areckx> I can't upload on this wifi, so I don't have an example page
[08:56:47] <BillCriswell> Areckx: You can't do <script src="foo.js"> /* Scripts */ </script>, you have do do <script src="foo.js"></script> <script> /* Scripts */ </script>
[08:57:12] <Areckx> BillCriswell:  ?
[08:57:33] <eager> shouldn't Areckx link jquery first and the plugin later? in < head >
[08:57:56] <BillCriswell> That as well.
[08:57:58] <NoiseEee> Areckx: what eager just said, for one
[08:58:13] <ajpiano> Areckx: <script src="external.js"></script> <script>/*inline script*/
[08:58:16] <BillCriswell> You also don't need to include jquery-flexslider-min.js twice.
[08:58:27] <Areckx> AHH that works eager
[08:58:35] <Areckx> and BillCriswell
[08:58:44] <Areckx> thanks, now I just need to tweak the css
[08:58:44] <royalty> harpal: is it okay if I private message you
[08:59:12] <harpal> royalty: ok
[09:00:06] <pamelafox> is there an opposite of closest() ? basically i want to find the matching element of minimum depth, given a particular parent and selector
[09:01:02] <amph1bius> pamelafox: find ?
[09:01:05] <BillCriswell> pamelafox: I image find('.foo').eq(0) would give you the closest... I'd have to mess with it though.
[09:01:49] <pamelafox> ah u think its always returns them in order of depth?
[09:02:27] <BillCriswell> pamelafox: http://jsbin.com/usipog/1/edit seems like the case.
[09:03:37] <BillCriswell> pamelafox: If it's the immediate child you can do .children('.child')
[09:05:01] <pamelafox> nah its not necessarily immediate child. looks like it does return by depth. thanks for that!
[09:05:08] <ajpiano> mpereira: apparently it's a known issue, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5877
[09:08:41] <skinofstars> hey guys. how come $('option").first().attr("selected","selected"); isn't then picked up by $('option:selected') on first load?
[09:08:54] <skinofstars> is there a better way of selecting something on first load?
[09:09:30] <awc737> will these loop for every instance of both elements?
[09:09:30] <awc737> $('.imgslider').each(function(){
[09:09:38] <awc737> oops, I mean: $('#slider, .imgslider').each(function(){
[09:10:36] <skinofstars> awc737: that will pick up every instance of .imgslider in #slider
[09:11:52] <awc737> skinofstars, but the comma?
[09:12:18] <awc737> every instance of .imgslider in #slider would be without the comma
[09:12:43] <skinofstars> awc737: right you are. you normally use a comma to scope it
[09:13:18] <awc737> skinofstars, so it will find every instance of #slider, and every instance of .imgslider?
[09:13:19] <skinofstars> awc737: so it should be $('.imgslider', '#slider') or $('#slider .imgslider')
[09:13:42] <awc737> I don't want .imgslider being inside #slider
[09:14:19] <skinofstars> awc737: then yes, your first example should do every instance of both
[09:14:26] <skinofstars> awc737: http://api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/
[09:14:59] <awc737> thanks skinofstars
[09:25:59] <GreatPotato> How can I use Jquery LazyLoad when img height it unknown?
[09:26:00] <s2013> what is the best way to sync something so for example if i type osmething in textbox someone else on that page can see me typing that in real time
[09:32:10] <mpereira> ajpiano: sorry, was away. didn't know the github project accepted issues for the website; thanks
[09:34:30] <skinofstars> s2013: look at something like websockets using node.js
[09:36:27] <dougb> is it possible to distinguish if the browser window is being close vs clicking an internal link on the site? I'm binding to 'beforeunload' and it seems to be a 'catch all'
[09:37:12] <NoiseEee> dougb: no, not possible to differentiate
[09:39:23] <s2013> oh
[09:39:56] <s2013> like socket.io?
[09:42:07] <wer0ckz> Hi. Help please about jquery / javascript using IE. I'm using Mark Of The Web - See screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/oikmv355x/ - It's not working. Is there a way to put a script to make the IE automatically disable the security or activeX ?
[09:45:25] <NoiseEee> wer0ckz: this is related to jquery how?
[09:51:15] <GreatPotato> How can I select a range of elements where data-price > x and < y?
[09:55:34] <shoky> GreatPotato:  $('.itemsClass').filter(function() { var d = $(this).data('price'); return d > x && d < y; })
[09:58:03] <wer0ckz> <NoiseEee> wer0ckz: this is related to jquery how? <-- i think so. if i remove all the .js file, there's no alert
[09:58:12] <alex88> hi guys
[09:58:12] <wer0ckz> is it possible ? http://postimg.org/image/oikmv355x/
[09:58:23] <alex88> I'm using jquery turbolinks and twitter bootstrap
[09:58:38] <alex88> it always works except one link that I don't understand why it doesn't
[09:58:58] <alex88> any idea?
[09:59:05] <NoiseEee> wer0ckz: you should find some IE support somewhere for that kind of (odd) thing
[09:59:09] <alex88> if someone wants to help I can send the link of the page
[09:59:47] <wer0ckz> i tried google and its all about "Mark Of the Web" - its not working
[10:02:54] <NoiseEee> wer0ckz: can i ask why you're even using that?
[10:04:12] <NoiseEee> you're developing exclusively for IE using activeX stuff?
[10:04:40] <wer0ckz> everything i open my script using IE it gives me an alert. my visitors are using IE
[10:04:44] <wer0ckz> is it possible?
[10:05:00] <NoiseEee> wer0ckz: but isn't mark of the web just meant to be used for serving files off your own computer and not the webserver?
[10:05:06] <wer0ckz> i've been searching in google it says something i need to put <!-- saved from url=(0023)about:internet -->
[10:05:32] <wer0ckz> i guess so. is there any other way to make the IE automatically disable the alert?
[10:05:42] <NoiseEee> wer0ckz: i think you're greatly misunderstanding what MOTW does.  disable WHAT alert?
[10:05:42] <wer0ckz> honestly i hate IE but i have no choice my visitors are using IE
[10:06:02] <wer0ckz> please see screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/oikmv355x/ <- that alert
[10:06:26] <NoiseEee> wer0ckz: yeah, don't serve up ActiveX objects??
[10:06:35] <wer0ckz> how?
[10:07:03] <wer0ckz> im not even sure if my scripts (jquery) are using activex
[10:07:21] <NoiseEee> wer0ckz: but your site provides access to the users' filesystem somewhere?
[10:07:40] <wer0ckz> yes
[10:07:49] <wer0ckz> C:\Users\Amon2048\Documents\TWC-NHD-notation-tool-5-1\index.html
[10:07:55] <alex88> it seems that the turbolink event is fired but it redirects instead of calling the ajax request
[10:08:02] <wer0ckz> im not using a webserver my work office is not allowing me
[10:08:11] <NoiseEee> wer0ckz: i have no idea what it is you're doing sorry.
[10:08:23] <NoiseEee> wer0ckz: but whatever your issue is, it is NOT jquery.
[10:08:28] <wer0ckz> oh
[10:08:32] <wer0ckz> i saw the screenshot?
[10:08:35] <NoiseEee> wer0ckz: so perhaps check stackoverflow or some other "mark of the web" stuff
[10:09:09] <wer0ckz> on the top you'll see something like "To help protect your security....."
[10:09:21] <NoiseEee> wer0ckz: understand that if your script/page/app provides access to the users' file system, then the users will have to authorize it
[10:09:23] <wer0ckz> i'll upload again
[10:09:31] <NoiseEee> i see it wer0ckz it has NOTHING to do with jquery
[10:09:40] <wer0ckz> ok thanks
[10:09:47] <wer0ckz> any recommended channels?
[10:11:06] <eager> wer0ckz: this mark of the web thing appears to be some speciality of internet explorer?
[10:11:27] <eager> try then ie user/developer channels/forums
[10:11:35] <wer0ckz> here's another screenshot:  http://postimg.org/image/ic96aux17/
[10:12:00] <wer0ckz> yeah just IE
[10:16:28] <iatkotep> Does anyone know how I can animate the change in panel-height on ui-tabs when I switch from one tab to another?
[10:16:47] <iatkotep> on tab switch, panel grows or shrinks to the size of the new tab before switching?
[10:33:38] <wer0ckz> Hi. Is this a correct statement -> var msg = "THIS IS A TEST"; $('#notifications').append('<br>' + msg + '</br>').show().trigger("play"); ?
[10:33:49] <wer0ckz> the trigger() animation typing is not working
[10:37:01] <pachet> what is listening for the play event
[10:38:16] <amph1bius> anyone have a sticky navigation example with scrollspy ?
[10:39:22] <wer0ckz> pachet: 1 sec i'll show you something
[10:39:50] <r1chard> Should I expect issues now or in the future with this selector (because of the dots)    [name=foo.bar.baz] ?
[10:39:57] <r1chard> Asking regarding philosophy.
[10:44:54] <ilteris_> can someone tell me why my tooltip is not working here? http://jsfiddle.net/hCQmF/
[10:47:26] <andrey_> did you call tooltip library in yout html code?
[10:47:28] <royalty> ilteris_: are you sure it includes jQuery UI?
[10:48:15] <ilteris_> Andrew_R: royalty  I thought I'd call it in JSFilddle. I made the library available on the left side.
[10:48:18] <ilteris_> isn't that enough?
[10:48:49] <ilteris_> honestly, I created for testing purposes, the real code is here: http://67.243.59.135/
[10:49:04] <wer0ckz> Help please - http://jsfiddle.net/PXBXK/ - trigger() is not working
[10:49:07] <ilteris_> I am trying to customize the tooltip on the magenta text when you roll over
[10:49:30] <Zzaichik> ilteris_: you're including jQuery, not jQuery UI
[10:49:48] <ilteris_> andrey_: royalty: currently, it works on the site.  http://67.243.59.135/ but I haven't found a way to customize it.
[10:50:13] <ilteris_> so I stepped back and tried to re-create it on jsfiddle and would take it from there.
[10:51:00] <royalty> customize it how?
[10:51:44] <ilteris_> royalty customize it so it looks like this: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2070808/Screenshots/lg.png
[10:51:45] <andrey_> if you want to customize design you need to change jquery-ui-git.css file
[10:52:07] <ilteris_> andrey_: I just want to customize one tooltip, not all of them
[10:52:30] <ilteris_> andrey_: I have figured this property 	tooltipClass: 'blueTooltip', under tooltip() function
[10:53:04] <ilteris_> so I can style this particular tooltip, but it didn't capture the styling from the bluetooltip class unfortunately,
[10:53:20] <andrey_> I think the simplest way is to make DIV and use it with fadeIn/fadeOut functions of pure jquery
[10:53:26] <wer0ckz> Help please - http://jsfiddle.net/PXBXK/ - trigger() is not working
[10:53:52] <r1chard> Guys jquery is ok with no quotes on [name=foo] but not with [name=foo.bar]  what is the list of allowed characters here?
[10:54:42] <ajpiano> ?escaping @ r1chard
[10:54:43] <bot-t> r1chard, If you wish to use any of the meta-characters (#;&,.+*~':"!^$[]()=>|/ ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: \\. http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ Also this is probably a bad idea, but... http://j.mp/autoescapeselector
[10:56:31] <r1chard> ajpiano, thank you. Is this a CSS limitation or jQuery?
[10:56:37] <ajpiano> jQuery
[10:56:59] <r1chard> ajpiano, ah
[10:57:03] <r1chard> performance I guess, right?
[10:57:04] <ilteris_> andrey_: I just thought it would be easier with tooltip. maybe you are right.
[10:57:20] <ajpiano> no it's that a period is ambiguous
[10:57:24] <royalty> literis_: good luck. seems like you can just add classes or something
[10:57:24] <ilteris_> andrey_: but if it's there, why not use it?
[10:57:35] <r1chard> ajpiano, is it here?  [name=abc.def]?
[10:57:39] <ilteris_> royalty: I tried but it's not working for custom styling.
[10:57:54] <ajpiano> i think so
[10:57:54] <ilteris_> royalty:l I am already there, just need to figure out the custom styling and it's giving me heebie-jeebies.
[10:58:06] <r1chard> ajpiano, ok thanks
[10:58:14] <wer0ckz> Help please - http://jsfiddle.net/PXBXK/ - trigger() is not working
[10:58:18] <royalty> ilteris_: is the CSS not applying to that class or something?
[10:58:27] <ilteris_> royalty: exactly
[10:58:37] <ilteris_> royalty: I can see the class is assigned on the rollover
[10:58:46] <ilteris_> royalty: it's just the style is not picked up.
[10:59:32] <andrey_> ilteris_: So you can redefine style for tooltip only for this page in small additional css file or in page code
[11:00:42] <ilteris_> andrey_: that's exactly why I posted that jsfiddle, so you guys can help me making it work on the jsfiddle and I learn how to do it.
[11:01:34] <ilteris_> andrey_: http://jsfiddle.net/hCQmF/2/ here
[11:01:59] <gotze_> anybody knows how can i make this code works only with the space bar  http://jsfiddle.net/ubugC/2/
[11:02:14] <ilteris_> bluetooltip class is not applied. (well I cannot get any tooltip on jsfiddle anyway)
[11:04:24] <Billy1> Any idea why alert($('#editfile form').html()); works fine on Chrome/FF but IE displays an 'undefined' unless I do a alert($('#editfile').html());
[11:04:38] <Billy1> I'm doing that alert to test why the form wasn't submitting using ajaxSubmit
[11:05:03] <Billy1> editfile is a div dialog, using ajax i load a form into it
[11:05:14] <wer0ckz> Help please - http://jsfiddle.net/PXBXK/ - trigger() is not working
[11:06:21] <shoky> wer0ckz:  change the <br>...<br>  to  <p>...</p>
[11:06:52] <shoky> wer0ckz: and you need to call .ticker() first.. http://jsfiddle.net/PXBXK/1/
[11:07:09] <wer0ckz> oh
[11:07:29] <wer0ckz> i see
[11:07:36] <wer0ckz> so u need .ticker() first
[11:07:37] <wer0ckz> thank you man
[11:07:45] <shoky> it says to do that..
[11:08:38] <wer0ckz> got it. thank you so much
[11:09:53] <ilteris_> man this tooltip is going to drive me insane
[11:14:56] <xsdser> w
[11:15:24] <xsdser> k
[11:17:29] <shoky> ilteris_: make your selector more specific. e.g.  .ui-tooltip.blueTooltip { ... }
[11:17:42] <monk12> Hey all, I am using Fondation with Jquery and am getting this error:  $(...).orbit is not a function
[11:17:55] <monk12> Foundation*
[11:18:30] <monk12> One person said jquery might be loading twice... I dont think it is... anyway to check that via Firebug? dont think Net Tab shows that
[11:19:20] <ilteris_> shoky: you think is that the case of the problem?
[11:20:07] <shoky> ilteris_:  yes. also, the tooltip is made out of an outer .ui-tooltip that your class is added to, and an inner div with .ui-tooltip-content
[11:20:15] <ilteris_> my first question is why the hell is it not working on jsfiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/hCQmF/4/
[11:20:36] <shoky> ilteris_: so you might wanna style the inner one with  .ui-tooltip.blueTooltip .ui-tooltip-content { ... }
[11:20:55] <ilteris_> shoky, do you mind lookingat my jsfiddle please?
[11:21:09] <shoky> ilteris_:  because of $j and you didn;t close the div
[11:21:11] <ribot> hi
[11:21:46] <ilteris_> shoky: :) thanks.
[11:22:08] <ilteris_> shoky: got it work on the jsfiddle, now I am going to add the styling like you suggested
[11:22:14] <ribot> why doesn't the third statment here work? var status = $('.status'); console.log( $('.status').text() ); console.log( status.text() );
[11:22:52] <monk12> status is DOM node not jquery wrapped DOM nodes.
[11:23:12] <monk12> oh one sec. let me rethink that
[11:23:16] <ilteris_> shoky: thank you! it works like a charm now with .ui-tooltip.
[11:23:24] <shoky> ilteris_: cool. np
[11:23:51] <monk12> is status just something like <span class="status">some text</span>?
[11:24:03] <ribot> monk12: yes
[11:24:43] <monk12> not sure. can you put it on JSFiddle?
[11:24:52] <monk12> to prove it doesnt work.
[11:25:52] <monk12> http://jsfiddle.net/AQAnm/
[11:26:00] <monk12> works for me^ ribot
[11:29:12] <tpyo> jquery selectors when you write them inline, they run the moment the html is renderedm right?
[11:29:37] <tpyo> i.e. if you use jquery to add an element an inline selector that wires an event wont catch it?
[11:29:47] <amph1bius> try it and see :)
[11:30:08] <tpyo> well i figured i'd ask as opposed to trying it and running the risk im doing something else wrong
[11:30:33] <tpyo> as there is always the possibility i fuck up something else such as the selector or missing a piece of syntax
[11:31:00] <BillCriswell> tpyo: You worried about re-saving and re-loading the page?
[11:31:26] <tpyo> no, just if I add new elements will they be wired up to events the same way that original elements will?
[11:31:47] <tpyo> i.e. $("selector").each(function(){etc})
[11:32:08] <shoky> you're mixing up so many terms, i can't make out the question
[11:32:10] <amph1bius> depends how you attach the original events
[11:32:18] <tpyo> no, i mean $(".selector").click(function (event) {
[11:32:34] <tpyo> so if thats inline, i can see how its going to wire up when the page loads
[11:32:51] <amph1bius> why not jsbin it and try
[11:33:02] <tpyo> but if I later do: $("something").add("some html with the original selector")
[11:33:29] <tpyo> then im guessing that the original selector that wired events wont be privy to the new html that i've added
[11:33:53] <tpyo> i guess my question is if selectors that wire up events keep listening for new html after the page has loaded
[11:34:00] <tpyo> or if they just run the once
[11:34:23] <shoky> it won't, unless you use event delegation
[11:36:05] <shoky> e.g. $('#main').on('click', '.itemClass', function() {...})  where #main is already in the DOM
[11:36:11] <tpyo> so if I use .on() instead of just directly wiring it will work?
[11:36:29] <shoky> just using .on() isn't enough, you need to use event delegation
[11:36:45] <shoky> read about it.. see ?on
[11:36:45] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:36:48] <tpyo> in the same fashion you did
[11:36:51] <shoky> yes
[11:36:58] <tpyo> aye, I was just reading that now
[11:37:23] <tpyo> so on() (previously .delegate) keeps checking the dom or rather just responds to events
[11:37:39] <tpyo> whereas hardwiring is just a one-off process
[11:38:17] <shoky> when used like i did, it delegates the event handling to #main, relying on event-bubbling so it'll catch click events from descendant .itemClass elements
[11:38:39] <shoky> so it really only sets one event handler, on #main, and that's it. no re-checking the DOM
[11:39:06] <tpyo> that is very interesting information shoky :)
[11:39:26] <tpyo> I thank you heartily
[11:39:31] <shoky> ;]
[11:40:45] <ilteris_> hey shoky, can I ask one last question regarding tooltip? I could style it like the way I want, only thing left is to position it 10 pixel higher from where it is now: http://67.243.59.135/
[11:40:54] <morten> HI, having a problem with Jquery, TweenLite and IE8, anybody have 5 min to help ??
[11:41:26] <ilteris_> shoky: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2070808/Screenshots/lh.png so I would like it to appear i10 px higher from where it is now.
[11:41:54] <shoky> ilteris_: doesn't it have a neat jquery-ui'ish "position" option?
[11:42:38] <shoky> ilteris_: use that :P
[11:42:46] <johnn_21> any ideas whats the problem here.. the space is not bringing results http://jsfiddle.net/ubugC/3/
[11:42:55] <ilteris_> shoky: isn't position makes it position absolutely?
[11:43:58] <shoky> ilteris_: it's positioned absolutely either way, i think
[11:44:07] <ilteris_> shoky: oh ok then, thanks
[11:46:44] <shoky> johnn_21: what results do you expect it to bring?
[11:47:04] <johnn_21> shoky:  all results
[11:47:24] <johnn_21> shoky:  only when hitting space..
[11:47:34] <shoky> johnn_21: by default it uses the input value
[11:48:12] <shoky> johnn_21: you can give it an empty string to give all the values, but then you need minLength: 0
[11:48:19] <johnn_21> shoky:  i have tried changing minlengh to 0 and it works.. but not as expected
[11:48:39] <tpyo> sorry, another quick question. If I do a selector and get multiple results back will it only execute on the first? i.e. $("#something").remove() will remove everything in the dom with the id something or only the first item it finds?
[11:49:05] <Cork> tpyo: depends on the command, most of them is all
[11:49:09] <tpyo> or do I have to $("#something").each( etc )
[11:49:17] <johnn_21> when u change minlengh to 0 u can bring all results by hitting the up down keys
[11:49:18] <tpyo> ah, okay, so a bit of trial and error is in order
[11:49:24] <Cork> but ex. those that read values is normally the first
[11:49:25] <tpyo> I imagine there are "fun" exceptions :)
[11:49:30] <shoky> johnn_21: http://jsfiddle.net/ubugC/4/
[11:49:40] <Cork> tpyo: its stated in the documentation
[11:49:41] <tpyo> ah okay thats a nice rule of thumb to live by for now
[11:49:47] <Cork> tpyo: api.jquery.com
[11:49:52] <tpyo> thanks Cork
[11:50:08] <johnn_21> shoky:  thankssss shoky !!
[11:50:18] <shoky> nppppp
[11:50:32] <Cork> tpyo: and no, the exceptions is quite logical
[11:50:56] <tpyo> ah, so its not like the php naming convention then ;)
[11:51:36] <Cork> tpyo: ex. $('a').attr('href') will return the attribute from the first matched element
[11:51:46] <Cork> as a string has a hard time returning multiple string
[11:51:49] <Cork> +s
[11:51:49] <tpyo> yeah, that makes sense
[12:12:55] <Croves> It's OK to do this: $(this + ':selected').val() ?
[12:15:01] <Croves> I need to get the selected value from a droplist
[12:18:24] <fikst> just do .val() on the select itself
[12:19:06] <awc737> if I Have the value "80px", is there a simple way with jQuery to say 80px - 20px ?
[12:19:35] <NoiseEee> well subtracting generally only works with numbers.
[12:19:56] <NoiseEee> so you'll have to change 80px to 80 and then do your subtraction.
[12:20:27] <awc737> ok
[12:21:01] <awc737> I'll use parseInt
[12:23:08] <awc737> is this the ugliest line you've ever seen?
[12:23:11] <awc737> slider.find('.galleria-stage').css('bottom', parseInt(slider.find('.galleria-stage').css('bottom')) - 20);
[12:23:17] <wer0ckz> Hi. Help please - http://jsfiddle.net/PXBXK/2/ - how can i execute append() one by one - that one appends at the same time. How can make it one by one ?
[12:24:44] <maxmoore14> this is really a pure javascript question, but hoping for some help: http://jsbin.com/esinek/3/
[12:24:55] <maxmoore14> just want to know if I am using 'apply' correctly
[12:32:18] <Cork> maxmahem: no
[12:32:44] <Cork> 1. apply takes an array, call takes arguments
[12:33:05] <Cork> 2. the first argument to apply/call bećomes this in the called function
[12:33:38] <maxmoore14> Cork: yeah, I think what I am looking for is bind
[12:34:00] <Cork> bind doesn't work like that either
[12:34:25] <Cork> bind binds a variable name to the scope of the function
[12:34:35] <maxmoore14> http://jsbin.com/esinek/4/edit
[12:34:38] <Cork> not magically connects it to another function
[12:34:50] <Cork> no
[12:34:57] <maxmoore14> take a look at the new changes - do you see what I'm trying to do?
[12:35:05] <maxmoore14> I know it isn't right yet
[12:35:21] <Cork> hmm, on second though
[12:35:36] <Cork> hmm now i start to understand what you're trying to do :)
[12:35:38] <paul4_> Sorry to bother, but do you have a rough ETA on when the change to allow whitespace in $(htmlString) will land?
[12:35:43] <maxmahem> Cork: YES
[12:35:44] <paul4_> * does anyone
[12:35:59] <wer0ckz> Help please - http://jsfiddle.net/PXBXK/3/ - How to execute text() one at a time?
[12:36:00] <guideX> why wouldn't this work to get the text of a input textbox? var txt = $("#edit-keys").val(); .... alert(txt);  // txt is always empty
[12:36:38] <maxmoore14> Cork: it seems like I'm getting it slightly out of order. What do you suggest?
[12:36:40] <wer0ckz> Help please - http://jsfiddle.net/PXBXK/3/ - How to execute text() one at a time?
[12:36:47] <wer0ckz> opps sorry
[12:36:51] <Cork> maxmahem: though you can only bind this, not arbitrary number of arguments
[12:36:52] <BillCriswell> guideX: I see no reason that wouldn't work. IT must be something else.
[12:37:05] <NoiseEee> paul4_: what?
[12:37:15] <guideX> hmm i'm using it within a $("#edit-submit").click(function(event) {
[12:37:16] <paul4_> or even if it is still planned.
[12:37:23] <NoiseEee> paul4_: what issue are you having??
[12:37:26] <guideX> and the event is properly triggered
[12:37:35] <paul4_> $(     '<div></div>'); --- whitespace at the beginning
[12:37:40] <Cork> maxmahem: http://jsbin.com/esinek/5/edit
[12:37:43] <paul4_> throws syntax error
[12:38:01] <guideX> oh and it's not undefined, it's just empty
[12:38:08] <guideX> so like the alert box has nothing in it
[12:38:18] <Cork> paul4_: whitespaces is find in the function call
[12:38:26] <shoky> wer0ckz: http://jsfiddle.net/PXBXK/4/
[12:38:27] <Cork> as long as it's just plain spaces
[12:38:34] <maxmahem> Cork: !!!!
[12:38:37] <BillCriswell> paul4_: Definitely not a syntax error.
[12:39:12] <NoiseEee> paul4_: yeah not raelly sure what issue it is you seem to be having.
[12:39:18] <Cork> maxmahem: woops wrong nick
[12:39:36] <Cork> maxmoore14: http://jsbin.com/esinek/5/edit
[12:39:56] <paul4_> http://jsfiddle.net/JRpAZ/
[12:40:08] <maxmoore14> Cork: here's an alt version I just worked out: http://jsbin.com/esinek/4/edit
[12:40:14] <maxmoore14> thx for the help
[12:40:28] <paul4_> relating to this change: http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#jquery-htmlstring-versus-jquery-selectorstring
[12:40:49] <paul4_> Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: <div>Hi</div>
[12:41:27] <wer0ckz> shoky: this one please http://jsfiddle.net/PXBXK/3/ - how to execute text() one at a time
[12:41:44] <wer0ckz> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/PXBXK/5/
[12:41:45] <wer0ckz> sorry
[12:42:56] <NoiseEee> paul4_: ahh i see. well i mean, what to say about that other than why are you using white space like that :P
[12:43:12] <NoiseEee> paul4_: and that the citation specifies 'well thats the way it is now'
[12:43:20] <guideX> it's so weird..
[12:43:31] <guideX> why would an input val() be empty when it's not...
[12:43:39] <Cork> paul4_: paul4_ ah, you have it in the string
[12:43:57] <paul4_> my EJS templates tend to have a newline at the beginning of them
[12:44:03] <Cork> paul4_: ya, i can reproduce taht problem
[12:44:25] <paul4_> it's "as designed" for now, but I heard that they were considering allowing whitespace at the start
[12:44:36] <paul4_> was wondering if anyone knew if/when that would happen
[12:45:08] <NoiseEee> paul4_: i can't imagine a statement like "Bottom line: HTML strings passed to jQuery() that start with something other than a less-than character will be interpreted as a selector." provides any consideration for allowing whitespace at the start
[12:45:20] <paul4_> it's the only thing preventing me from upgrading to 1.9/2.0
[12:45:25] <Cork> paul4_: well you could just avoid using the $() for parsing
[12:45:26] <shoky> wer0ckz: donno what you want exactly but here's one thing you can do.. http://jsfiddle.net/PXBXK/6/
[12:45:39] <paul4_> right, but i have hundreds of places in my code that use it
[12:45:54] <NoiseEee> paul4_: so it looks like your code is going to be staying on 1.8.x :)
[12:46:05] <paul4_> if that's the way it will be, then i will bite the bullet of fixing it to upgrade
[12:46:19] <Cork> cause i can understand why they would want to keep the $() parser as slim as possible (as it runs for every css selector)
[12:46:25] <NoiseEee> i assume thats the way it will be considering the terms/language used in that sentence i quoted
[12:46:36] <paul4_> but like i said, i  heard rumor that it would allow whitespace in a future version
[12:46:42] <paul4_> so i would just wait until then if that were the case
[12:46:44] <Cork> but it is a nice catcha to know about
[12:47:07] <Cork> well the problem becomes what more?
[12:47:11] <Cork> should it allow tabs?
[12:47:14] <Cork> new lines?
[12:47:16] <Cork> ...
[12:47:30] <Cork> it might be an ugly slippery slope
[12:47:40] <paul4_> whitespace :)
[12:47:49] <paul4_> newline, tab, space
[12:48:03] <fikst> you  could always $.trim() it
[12:48:05] <paul4_> maybe it'd just automatically call $trimstart
[12:48:11] <Cork> hmm
[12:48:19] <paul4_> i know, but that still makes me have to change hundreds of places
[12:48:19] <paul4_> heh
[12:48:21] <NoiseEee> paul4_: as you can see, the change was deliberate. not sure where you heard your rumour :)
[12:48:27] <Cork> fikst: nice idea
[12:48:28] <paul4_> i'll find the bug
[12:48:37] <NoiseEee> besides, no crime staying on 1.8
[12:48:42] <shoky> why trim when you can parseHTML
[12:49:17] <paul4_> HAH, wow
[12:49:20] <paul4_> i was looking at this earlier
[12:49:21] <paul4_> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13223
[12:49:27] <paul4_> 3 hours ago there was a reply
[12:49:31] <paul4_> i guess that answers my question :)
[12:50:31] <Cork> paul4_:  window.$ = function() { if(typeof(arguments[0]) == 'string') { arguments[0] = $.trim(arguments[0]); } return jQuery.apply(jQuery, arguments); };
[12:51:09] <paul4_> yeah, that's a decent shim for now too
[12:51:16] <paul4_> thanks
[12:51:33] <mercwithamouth> what would be a good way only make divs visible if the particular option value that matches the 'grade' is shown?  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9797aef52bcfb0266f0b
[12:52:11] <mercwithamouth> are there any sort of pattern matching tricks a newbie to js/jquery might not be aware of?
[12:53:18] <Cork> mercwithamouth: bind a keypress/change event on the select box and based on the value show hide the divs
[12:53:32] <Cork> sorry keypress+change event
[12:53:54] <Cork> (keypress is needed for keyboard shifting through the select box)
[12:54:54] <darrennnn> hi #jquery. simple example: http://jsfiddle.net/JBsA6/ works correctly. this addition causes it to go wrong http://jsfiddle.net/JBsA6/1/ -- the goal here is to wrap the p's in red, and then wrap the h3 and that wrap in blue.
[12:56:54] <mercwithamouth> hrmm ahh i see. dur.
[12:57:05] <Cork> $('target').on('change', function() {}).on('keypress', function() { var self = this; setTimeout(function() { $(self).trigger('change'); }, 0); });
[12:57:07] <Cork> and my recommendation is to add the grade as a class on the div for matching
[12:57:09] <Cork> grade-pre-k, grade-k, grade-1 and so on
[12:58:13] <fikst> darrennnn, http://jsfiddle.net/JBsA6/2/
[12:58:21] <fikst> correct?
[12:58:43] <darrennnn> fikst: yes but i thought that i should be doing it all in one chain?
[12:59:02] <mercwithamouth> Cork: i believe you're right. that'll make it easier
[13:01:33] <wer0ckz>  Help please - http://jsfiddle.net/PXBXK/7/ - how can i make the var msg1 not to disappear and msg2 goest to the next line?
[13:01:46] <BillCriswell> darrennnn: http://jsfiddle.net/JBsA6/3/ ?
[13:02:03] <BillCriswell> If the one chain is really required lol
[13:02:20] <xsdser> which is the best jquery book?
[13:02:36] <darrennnn> BillCriswell: i guess it's  not that its required? i just thought that was the preferred thing to do in jquery...?
[13:02:45] <BillCriswell> xsdser: http://try.jquery.com/ seems nice.
[13:03:06] <fikst> wer0ckz, http://jsfiddle.net/PXBXK/8/
[13:03:21] <darrennnn> fikst, BillCriswell: between the two of you i think you answered my question. the statements seem pretty equilavent
[13:03:32] <Cork> BillCriswell, darrennnn: why not just http://jsfiddle.net/JBsA6/4/
[13:04:01] <xsdser> BillCriswell: thanks a lot!! :)
[13:04:01] <wer0ckz> <fikst> wer0ckz, http://jsfiddle.net/PXBXK/8/ - msg2 doesnt fadeIn
[13:04:06] <BillCriswell> darrennnn: I think readability is the most important thing. I wouldn't do anything like this with JAvaScript I don't think.
[13:04:25] <darrennnn> anything "like this" ?
[13:04:26] <BillCriswell> Cork's demo is pretty sweet.
[13:04:43] <BillCriswell> darrennnn: It just seems like a weird task to rely on jQuery to do in my eyes.
[13:05:01] <BillCriswell> I'm picky about what I'll use JS for.
[13:05:10] <Cork> but ya, markup should be in the html, not in js
[13:05:46] <saml> how do I get final url .ajax() will use?
[13:05:58] <Cork> saml: natively; you can't
[13:06:02] <saml> thanks
[13:06:13] <wer0ckz> How can i fadeIn text one by one ? http://jsfiddle.net/PXBXK/8/ - it doesnt look synchronized
[13:06:14] <Cork> saml: simplest solution is to have the server set an extra header with the new url
[13:06:14] <darrennnn> BillCriswell: so the task is that a client has a simple cms and the goal is to have them put their content (links) into the cms seperated with proper headings. then i take that output and whip it up into a fancy interface using JS. this way they don't screw up the wrapping with divs and what not.
[13:06:17] <saml> not sure why xhr.url doesn't exist :(
[13:06:30] <Cork> saml: security reasons
[13:06:38] <darrennnn> BillCriswell: also when mobile, it just reverts back to their regular content.
[13:06:41] <saml> oh i see
[13:06:42] <darrennnn> no fancy
[13:06:52] <BillCriswell> saml: beforeSend: function(xht, option ) { console.log( option.url ); } might get you close?
[13:06:56] <darrennnn> Cork: studying your example. very interesting approach thank yuo.
[13:07:05] <Cork> sam452: something like X-target: new-url
[13:07:06] <Cork> opps
[13:07:08] <Cork> saml: ^
[13:07:46] <fikst> wer0ckz, http://jsfiddle.net/PXBXK/9/
[13:08:10] <Cork> darrennnn: well it is the solution that causes the least amount of dom traversal so...
[13:08:14] <wer0ckz> thank you
[13:08:17] <fikst> quick and dirty, but you should get the idea
[13:08:29] <darrennnn> Cork: right, which is what i was looking for.
[13:09:04] <BillCriswell> darrennnn: So you want to wrap and unwrap on browser resizes basically?
[13:09:16] <Cork> O_o
[13:09:33] <Cork> (please say no...)
[13:09:34] <darrennnn> BillCriswell: it isn't responsive
[13:09:46] <BillCriswell> Oh ok.
[13:09:57] <Cork> darrennnn: but why do this in js at all?
[13:10:21] <Cork> just have the div's there and control if they affect the textflow through css
[13:10:24] <BillCriswell> darrennnn: If the html is malformed from the get go using jQuery to wrap it up is going to cause just as much issues.
[13:10:36] <darrennnn> cork its a lonnngggggggg list of video links. i am using the wrapping to turn it into an accordian and clicking the link will pop modals etc.
[13:10:38] <uplinx> howdy, i'm feling pretty ummm. stumped here.  been goign in circles iwth jquery Validate, but no love.  http://myphame2.wearedeep.com  click - signup.  username should be initiating an xhttp request to see if username is available, nothing happening.
[13:10:39] <guideX> is there an easy way to animate .after? kind of like .show(200)?
[13:11:00] <Cork> darrennnn: and you don't have control over the original html?
[13:11:12] <darrennnn> BillCriswell: understood. this is not "the best" solution but it is one acceptable for time and budget.
[13:11:22] <fikst> guideX, do you mean .delay() ?
[13:11:27] <darrennnn> Cork: not reaaaaly no.
[13:11:31] <guideX> yeah but how do I use with .after
[13:11:38] <BillCriswell> darrennnn: Good enough reason for me.
[13:11:40] <Cork> was afraid of that
[13:11:50] <Cork> i hear that more and more sadly
[13:12:04] <darrennnn> at the end of the day i am just having them put in headings and ul
[13:12:10] <darrennnn> ul's with the video links.
[13:12:15] <Cork> personally i would prob proxy it over a server and let a server process handle it
[13:12:25] <darrennnn> it doesnt really warrant building a more complex system.
[13:12:37] <guideX> oh wait, I can do .after(blahblah).hide.show(200); thanks anyways :)
[13:12:46] <fikst> :)
[13:12:51] <guideX> .hide().show(200) rather
[13:13:23] <darrennnn> Cork, BillCriswell, fikst: thanks you've been helpful
[13:13:28] <Cork> guideX: that will hide the element you have in tree not the one you add
[13:13:52] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[13:16:45] <Toerkeium> hello guys
[13:17:08] <guideX> ah ok cork
[13:17:11] <guideX> let me check that out
[13:17:19] <Toerkeium> is it possible to add a class to a div changing it's opacity "on the fly"?
[13:17:40] <guideX> it does appear to be hiding the whole thing cork
[13:17:47] <guideX> I didn't notice it before, thanks for point it out
[13:17:58] <BillCriswell> Toerkeium: with jQuery UI you can use toggleClass() and it'll animate between properties.
[13:18:01] <subanomic> hi
[13:18:37] <Cork> guideX: $(newelement).insertAfter(target).hide().show(200) is prob what you want
[13:18:49] <guideX> ah ok cool
[13:19:02] <darrennnn> Toerkeium: could you use something like setTimeout
[13:19:56] <BillCriswell> $el.toggleClass('hidden', 2000); would fade it out ( or in ) taking two seconds...
[13:20:05] <Toerkeium> BillCriswell: but I don't have another class defined.. I just want one class defined in jquery-ui.css but at its 50% opacity
[13:20:20] <Toerkeium> darrennnn: how?
[13:20:29] <subanomic> is it possible to store the inner HTML of a DOM element and restore it later, with CSS classes that were added dynamically preserved?
[13:20:41] <BillCriswell> Toerkeium: $el.toggleClass('half-way-visible') ?
[13:20:47] <darrennnn> Toerkeium: i need more information about what you are trying to do. you said adding a class to something after a period of time
[13:20:50] <guideX> cool it's working gvreat cork
[13:20:54] <guideX> much better than before..
[13:20:55] <subanomic> e.g. if I have the HTML document <div id="main"><div id="test"></div></div> and then I do $("#test").addClass("myclass"), then I want to have <div id="main"><div id="test" class="myclass"></div></div>
[13:21:07] <Cork> subanomic: classes is preserved more or less how ever you do it
[13:21:14] <guideX> only thing is, if I click the button more than once, the thing I wish to insert appears a second, third (etc) time
[13:21:16] <Cork> subanomic: what is lost is dom states
[13:21:37] <fikst> subanomic,  var html = $('.selector').html()
[13:21:54] <subanomic> what are dom states
[13:22:02] <Toerkeium> BillCriswell: what would be "half-way-visible" ? sorry I don't get how to get it working
[13:22:12] <Cork> subanomic: if a checkbox is checked, event listeners and so on
[13:22:22] <subanomic> ah. yeah, can I somehow save those?
[13:22:41] <Cork> not in a simple manner
[13:22:50] <Cork> you would have to manually convert the state to html
[13:22:55] <cwatson> jQuery Image Slider: Does anyone know if it's possible to make this slide left to right without changing the code it has now? - https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/77127384/contentSlider2/index.html
[13:22:59] <Cork> subanomic: best would be to just keep them as dom
[13:23:00] <Toerkeium> darrennnn: not at a period of time, just using an existing class and adding it to a div at its 50% opacity, but not changing the styles file definition or adding another class in the body. Like re-using an existing one and changing its opacity
[13:23:06] <darrennnn> cork what happens if you create a node and then clone existing nodes to it. does that preserve it?
[13:23:17] <cwatson> correction: without changing much code*
[13:23:19] <mercwithamouth> Cork: hmm, wouldn't this be sufficient for changing or getting rid of the style attribute as well?  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/674db0a09bdae5717278
[13:23:20] <Toerkeium> BillCriswell: I'll read about toggleClass! thank you
[13:23:23] <subanomic> Cork: okay, that would work as well. How can I clone the dom contents and then restore them later?
[13:23:48] <NoiseEee> subanomic: why not just hide the container you want to "restore later", clone what you need for immediate presentation
[13:23:56] <Cork> subanomic: you want a clone or just remove it temporarily?
[13:24:07] <subanomic> remove temporarily
[13:24:19] <Cork> darrennnn: prevent what?
[13:24:23] <subanomic> never mind, I can do that myself
[13:24:25] <BillCriswell> Toerkeium: http://jsbin.com/esayaz/1/edit is what I was thinking.
[13:24:28] <Cork> `api detatch
[13:24:28] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[13:25:06] <Cork> `api detach
[13:25:06] <b-ot> Cork: .detach(): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[13:25:11] <darrennnn> Toerkeium: $(ele).addClass("yourclass").css("opacity", .5); ?
[13:25:16] <darrennnn> something like that?
[13:25:17] <Cork> subanomic: use that and store the dom in a variable
[13:25:28] <Toerkeium> darrennnn : yes
[13:25:31] <Toerkeium> let me see
[13:25:38] <Toerkeium> thanks BillCriswell I'll check what you did, thanks a lot
[13:25:50] <clov3r> anyone know of an ie8 issue with jquery? getting an error "Object does not support this property or method" it's highlighting line 4, column 6102 of the jquery file, (jquery 2.0.0, from google)
[13:26:03] <darrennnn> Toerkeium: you should check my syntax, i am no expert.
[13:26:06] <Cork> mercwithamouth: sure, not sure why you're asking me though :)
[13:26:19] <NoiseEee> clov3r: yeah jquery 2.0 doesn't support ie8
[13:26:24] <clov3r> i'll try an older version, see what happens
[13:26:31] <Cork> subanomic: and then when you want to add it in again, just append/html it
[13:26:33] <Toerkeium> darrennnn: it was perfect!
[13:26:35] <mercwithamouth> Cork: lol i should have made it a public...query. <- no pun intended.  for whatever reason that didn't work. but i know i'm close lol
[13:26:35] <Toerkeium> thank you
[13:26:38] <DarkArtist69> have created a page with multiple slid downs on click using .slideDown()/.slideUp() is there a way to make a button that will open all and a button that will close all of them>
[13:26:41] <clov3r> oh ok NoiseEee good to know
[13:26:46] <clov3r> 1.9?
[13:27:08] <clov3r> that's kindof a bummer, i still have to support ie8 :P
[13:27:18] <darrennnn> my work here is done, i was able to help someone out woo woo.
[13:27:18] <NoiseEee> well 1.9 it is then
[13:27:20] <Cork> mercwithamouth: just remove the strings around the variable in line 6
[13:27:25] <fikst> you can use conditional comment to include 1.9 for ie
[13:27:37] <Cork> mercwithamouth: $(cName)
[13:28:22] <Cork> clov3r: 1.9 and 2.0 is basically the same lib
[13:28:43] <Cork> clov3r: 2.0 is explicitly built to be without ie8 support, and 1.9 is the full lib
[13:28:43] <mercwithamouth> Cork: ah hah!
[13:29:17] <clov3r> orly? that's cool
[13:29:32] <clov3r> heh
[13:29:36] <clov3r> oh god i am nerd
[13:29:48] <Cork> clov3r: the reason for jquery 2.0 is that ie8 most likely will die in ~10 months
[13:30:08] <clov3r> really?
[13:30:10] <Cork> so a lib without the old ie compatibility support needs to be made
[13:30:14] <clov3r> now that IS cool
[13:30:18] <clov3r> heh
[13:30:24] <Cork> clov3r: yes, xp dies in april 2014
[13:30:28] <Cork> EOL
[13:30:34] <NoiseEee> ie10 was pushed to my win7 install yesterday
[13:30:36] <Cork> and vista and up had ie9
[13:30:59] <Toerkeium> darrennnn: is there any way to set that class with opacity inside the element? so I don't have to make a reference it by its id?
[13:31:19] <Cork> NoiseEee: pushed and installed sufficiently isn't the same thing sadly
[13:31:37] <Cork> loads of users don't install updates
[13:31:50] <NoiseEee> yep
[13:32:02] <darrennnn> Toerkeium: i don't know what you mean. you can traverse?
[13:32:08] <NoiseEee> personally we're stuck on jquery 1.9 for client-facing things
[13:33:05] <Cork> NoiseEee: so just load 2.0 except for ie8 and down and use conditional comments to use 1.9 for the other
[13:33:16] <Cork> the libs is even made for that
[13:33:46] <Toerkeium> darrennnn: instead of $("#ele_id").addClass adding it by some class in the element or inside the element, lets say <div class="$(this).Class_Name(opacity, .5"> ?
[13:35:57] <Cork> NoiseEee: <!--[if lte IE 8]>jquery 1.9 <![endif]--><!--[if gte IE 8]>--> jquery 2.0 <![endif]-->
[13:36:01] <Cork> simple :)
[13:36:22] <Cork> opps error at the end there
[13:36:32] <Cork> last endif shoudl be <!-- <![endif]-->
[13:37:16] <darrennnn> Toerkeium: you could write a script tag to the page and handle it there. youre asking to write inline javascript which is pretty frowned upon but possible.
[13:37:26] <darrennnn> i dont know that you can write inline javscript to a div. but i don't know.
[13:38:03] <darrennnn> <a href="javascript: alert('foo')">say foo</a> is the limit to my inline javascript knoweldge
[13:38:10] <NoiseEee> Toerkeium:  $("#ele_id").css({opacity:0.5})
[13:39:10] <darrennnn> i think you might have to do something like <div><script type="text/javascript"> /*jquery here*/ </script></div>
[13:39:21] <Toerkeium> NoiseEee: I wanted to get ride of the id reference, as I have many of this elements on the same page and I would have to use different id's for each element
[13:39:33] <darrennnn> NoiseEee: use a class
[13:39:36] <darrennnn> err
[13:39:40] <fikst> Toerkeium, use a class selector
[13:39:40] <darrennnn> Toerkeium: use a class
[13:39:56] <fikst> $('.ele_class')
[13:40:00] <Toerkeium> ahhhh
[13:40:09] <Toerkeium> great!
[13:40:21] <Toerkeium> thanks a lot guys
[13:40:34] <Cork> inline javascript is always moved to the head by jquery
[13:40:50] <darrennnn> wha?
[13:43:07] <fikst> Cork, really?
[13:43:12] <Cork> yes
[13:43:40] <Cork> if the script tag is left in the body, every time you move the dom element that contains the script tag the script will execute again
[13:44:13] <Cork> so to prevent that they grab the script elements fro the dom and moves them
[13:45:09] <darrennnn> Cork: actually i just ran up against this. did this change since 1.7.1 because that version reloads the script
[13:45:41] <Cork> darrennnn: it's been like that at least since jquery 1.2.6
[13:45:50] <Cork> that is the first time i saw the effect
[13:46:16] <darrennnn> really! hmm.
[13:47:02] <fikst> does it apply to http://jsfiddle.net/x3xyA/
[13:47:29] <fikst> if I inspect the dom, bar is inside foo, and the script tag is still in bar
[13:47:40] <Cork> fikst: its most obvious with document.write
[13:47:56] <Cork> but most modern browsers doesn't allow that kind of execution anymore anyway
[13:48:42] <Cork> but it was a really common problem when ppl did parent.innerHTML = parent.innerHTML + 'new html string';
[13:48:55] <Cork> and suddenly all document.write calls ran again
[13:49:13] <Cork> and now you had two outputs at each script tag
[13:49:41] <fikst> hmm, interesting
[13:49:50] <fikst> ill dream about that tonight i think :)
[13:49:53] <Cork> (we talk 14+ years here :)
[13:50:07] <Cork> ago that is
[13:50:19] <darrennnn> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/eKztS/ ?
[13:51:22] <Cork> darrennnn: click it a few times and you see it go away
[13:51:55] <darrennnn> Cork: flip the library on the left to 2.0 and it doesn't fire when you first click
[13:53:06] <darrennnn> somewhere betwen 1.8.3 and 1.9.1
[13:55:11] <Cork> darrennnn: this used to be a real problem http://jsfiddle.net/eKztS/1/
[13:55:55] <Cork> the result used to be <h1>header1header2header3header4</h1>
[13:57:37] <darrennnn> huh weird. interesting.
[13:57:39] <fikst> does this have any effect on, for example getting html with ajax with a script tag in it, and adding it to the dom?
[13:57:53] <darrennnn> i would assume so
[13:58:14] <Cork> fikst: not unless you use document.write
[13:58:34] <fikst> ok
[13:58:39] <Cork> as there is hackery in jquery to keep things working normally
[14:05:08] <serversides> eu
[14:06:03] <Cork> darrennnn: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.2/src/core.js#L391
[14:06:09] <Cork> was introduced in 1.2
[14:07:04] <rubatdub> hi everyone
[14:07:13] <rubatdub> i'm trying to develop a star/unstar system
[14:08:33] <clov3r> good for you rubatdub!
[14:08:35] <darrennnn> Cork: i don't understand though i thought you were making the distinction that jquery pulls the script takes out BEFORE any manipulation happens. i only mentioned it because i'm writing my dumb wrapping thing for 1.71 and noticed that the script was reloading when things were wrapping.
[14:08:42] <clov3r> i support your efforts
[14:08:44] <clov3r> :D
[14:08:50] <rubatdub> lol
[14:08:59] <rubatdub> clov3r, i have the following js
[14:09:07] <rubatdub> http://pastie.org/7744945
[14:09:16] <Cork> darrennnn: hmm
[14:09:50] <darrennnn> Cork: that was my only point with my little demo. what you're saying is true definitely that it doesn't fire again... but it still fires on the first click.
[14:09:57] <darrennnn> but in newer jq it doesnt fire at all.
[14:10:06] <darrennnn> or rather, it fires ONCE. at load
[14:10:16] <darrennnn> rather than a second time when wrapping.
[14:10:22] <darrennnn> (getting wrappeD)
[14:10:34] <fikst> rubatdub, you could handle it in 1 click event
[14:10:38] <darrennnn> ill shut up now. i was just pointing it out cause i was experiencing it not 10 minutes before i came in the room.
[14:10:40] <fikst> just add and remove classes
[14:10:43] <Cork> darrennnn: do you have that example again?
[14:11:00] <fikst> and then do if ($(this).hasClass())
[14:11:28] <darrennnn> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/eKztS/ change the jquery version ... test at 1.83 and 1.91 again. youll see the difference
[14:12:28] <Cork> darrennnn: ha, ya i see why you get a different effect then what i talked about
[14:12:52] <Cork> darrennnn: jquery filters it when it added it to the page
[14:12:54] <darrennnn> Cork: yeah i mean it's neither here nor there, i was just surprised when you said that jquery has been scraping out script tags on load since 1.2
[14:12:57] <clov3r> rubatdub: what's your question
[14:12:59] <Cork> your example has it from the load
[14:13:14] <clov3r> i haven't drank any coffee yet this week so i may not be helpful
[14:13:19] <darrennnn> ahh
[14:13:20] <clov3r> but i'll try
[14:13:49] <fikst> clov3r, I guest his $('.unstar').on("click", function(event){ event doesn't trigger
[14:13:59] <fikst> but maybe rubatdub can tell us
[14:14:04] <rubatdub> yes that's it
[14:14:13] <rubatdub> when doing $('#'+id).removeClass('star').addClass('unstar');
[14:14:14] <Cork> darrennnn: http://jsfiddle.net/eKztS/2/
[14:14:20] <rubatdub> i get the unstar class
[14:14:42] <darrennnn> Cork: haha interesting.
[14:14:59] <rubatdub> but when i click on the new a href i don't get in $('.unstar').on("click", function(event){
[14:15:16] <clov3r> yep i see, there's probably a better way... but if you put the .on('click) handler on the PARENT of the <a> it'll work
[14:16:03] <clov3r> ie $('.unstar').parent().on('click', '.unstar', function(event){ UNSTARSTARTING })
[14:16:17] <rubatdub> clov3r actually i have <a class="star" id="{{ id }}_{{user:id}}">Je ne veux plus de cette voiture</a>
[14:16:30] <rubatdub> i can add a span in parent for exemple ?
[14:17:06] <clov3r> well what you want to do is apply the on handler to a parent element that will remain static on the page
[14:17:15] <rubatdub> yes
[14:17:28] <clov3r> so the parent know that when any of its child elements get clicked on to trigger the function
[14:17:50] <Cork> clov3r: that is one quite horrible selector actually...
[14:18:13] <Cork> better have a static parent instead of binding hundreds of delegated event handlers
[14:18:15] <clov3r> well yeah it probably is
[14:18:30] <clov3r> yep
[14:18:34] <clov3r> listen to the man from Cork
[14:18:38] <clov3r> he knows his stuff
[14:18:51] <Cork> $('#container').on('click', '.star', function() {}).on('click', '.unstar', function() {});
[14:19:08] <rubatdub> ok i will try that
[14:19:46] <Cork> that way you save loads of event handlers
[14:20:51] <clov3r> fwiw, i wouldn't have used that selector myself, but was using it to select a parent i didn't know the name of
[14:21:01] <fikst> $('#container').on('click', '.handlestar', function() { if ( $this.hasClass('star') //.... ) });
[14:21:18] <fikst> and if u do it like that, you save 1 more event handler :)
[14:21:34] <FunnyLookinHat> Is there a way to .clone() something and ensure that all of the bindings for children persist ?
[14:21:37] <Cork> true
[14:21:47] <FunnyLookinHat> oh.
[14:21:48] <FunnyLookinHat> true.
[14:21:50] <FunnyLookinHat> geez.
[14:21:50] <Cork> `api clone
[14:21:50] <b-ot> Cork: .clone(): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[14:21:55] <FunnyLookinHat> Thanks Cork   :D
[14:21:58] <Cork> it's in the docs
[14:22:00] <rubatdub> fikst, and Cork thanks for your help i will try this solution !
[14:22:44] <Cork> rubatdub: honestly i would do it in a totally different way though
[14:24:01] <clov3r> hmmm
[14:24:16] <rubatdub> if you have any example i can try and choose the best way :)
[14:24:18] <clov3r> is it possible to animate box-shadow?
[14:25:19] <fikst> clov3r, not without a plugin i guess http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/shadow-animation/
[14:25:26] <Cork> <a class="toggle"><span class="stared"></span><span class="unstared"></span></a> css: .toggle .stared { display: inline; } .toggle .unstared { display: none; }  .toggle.star .stared { display: none; } .toggle.star .unstared { display: inline; }
[14:25:42] <Cork> and then all you have to do is change the class, no html in js
[14:25:46] <garciawebdev> does somebody knows about an error on IE8 with jQuery 1.9.1 using: $('title').text() ??
[14:26:02] <garciawebdev> SCRIPT65535: Unexpected call to method or property access.
[14:26:02] <garciawebdev> jquery.min.js, line 4 character 26256
[14:26:50] <cwatson> jQuery Image Slider: Does anyone know if it's possible to make this slide left to right without changing the code it has now? - https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/77127384/contentSlider2/index.html
[14:27:12] <cwatson> *without changing much code
[14:28:02] <shoky> garciawebdev: why not 'document.title'
[14:29:44] <Cork> rubatdub: http://jsfiddle.net/D2Xqh/
[14:30:21] <garciawebdev> shoky is that cross-browser?
[14:31:05] <Cork> garciawebdev: you have to inject unknown dom elements in ie pre 9 for it to be able to handle them
[14:31:41] <garciawebdev> Cork but i only want to change page title
[14:31:57] <Cork> then do what shoky said
[14:32:00] <Cork> document.title =
[14:32:14] <Cork> garciawebdev: title isn't an element in the body
[14:32:39] <garciawebdev> i see
[14:33:08] <Cork> and yes document.title is as cross browser as anything can be
[14:33:14] <Cork> its been around since pre dom1
[14:33:21] <Cork> actually pre dom0 :)
[14:34:01] <Cork> if i remember correctly document.title came around the same time as document.write
[14:36:13] <garciawebdev> Cork seems so
[14:36:14] <garciawebdev> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/2755
[14:37:30] <Cork> garciawebdev: its the same reason as you don't use $('location') to change the url
[14:38:10] <garciawebdev> Cork, well, i understand that, but there's a <title> element on the document
[14:38:14] <Cork> basically all elements you can reach directly on document have little meaning using dom selection to find
[14:38:30] <Cork> garciawebdev: well it is in head
[14:38:34] <garciawebdev> Cork i see
[14:38:53] <Cork> and they are special in many ways
[15:02:38] <guideX> is there a way to discover which object you're clicking on via jquery?
[15:03:25] <kba> I have a draggable element and a droppable container, but it's also possible for me to drag my element outside of my container and drop it there
[15:03:38] <kba> That's bad. I can't have that happen. People die if that happens. How can I fix this?
[15:04:34] <kba> Like if the draggable element reaches the each of the droppable area, it just refuses to go further. Or if it's dropped outside, the element is just being put back into place. Or if I'm just being noticed of it somehow so I can put it back myself or recreate it.
[15:04:38] <kba> What can I do?
[15:06:01] <fikst> guideX, $(this)
[15:06:20] <guideX> ok thx
[15:10:06] <guideX> hmm i'm clicking on that area in the border of a lightbox2. It doesn't close when I click it.. I'm trying to figure out what it is like this... $("*").click(function(e) {    alert(e.target.id);     });     and other things, but it's empty
[15:10:30] <guideX> was thinking I can call the lightbox2 close if it's clicked, but can't figure out what i'm clicking on heh
[15:10:45] <guideX> the .id and val and name and html are all nothing or undefined
[15:12:46] <relipse> how do i delete a li ?
[15:13:00] <guideX> $("#myli").remove;
[15:13:21] <fikst> guideX, console.log( $(this) )
[15:13:32] <fikst> then click on it in the browsers inspector
[15:13:38] <guideX> hmm ok cool
[15:13:40] <guideX> i'll try now
[15:15:32] <guideX> oh I see
[15:15:51] <guideX> I am clicking on an <html element (the beginning of the popup
[15:15:54] <guideX> well thanks
[15:16:07] <guideX> I think
[15:18:16] <guideX> oh cool I found it, thanks again
[15:18:27] <guideX> I should be doing console.log(e); heh
[15:20:55] <TheEternalAbyss> excuse the silly question… is there a way to insert something like this $('.popup').toggleClass('open'); into an anchor directly, for say like a close button?
[15:21:11] <TheEternalAbyss> and how would the syntax be for that?
[15:22:06] <fikst> $('#close').on('click', function(e){$('.popup').toggleClass('open')})
[15:24:16] <TheEternalAbyss> i would have to put that in href= part?
[15:24:36] <fikst> no, in a script tag or js file
[15:24:43] <TheEternalAbyss> ah
[15:25:41] <TheEternalAbyss> noted. ok, I was hoping for just a direct only for that link deal but it's cool. I have that working in the bottom of my page in the script now. I just had to make sure it's targets were distinct
[15:25:50] <TheEternalAbyss> thank you for the assist
[15:26:17] <netto_> guys, I have about 3h avaiable now, I'd like to read something interesting about modern javascripts techniques, can someone can suggest me? I cn google, but someone may have some suggestiong that have already read and enjoyed
[15:32:34] <DarkArtist69> am trying to make a button that will open all div of a certain class .. no matter their current state. so if they are open it will stay open, if they are closed they will open.
[15:32:36] <DarkArtist69> any ideas?
[15:33:40] <guideX> $(".my_class").show(); ?
[15:34:25] <DarkArtist69> oh , is there a way to still make it slide out?..
[15:34:36] <guideX> $(".my_button").click(function() { $(".my_class").show(200);  });
[15:34:54] <DarkArtist69> great.. will try that now :) thank you
[15:52:52] <guideX> any ideas why this wouldn't be working on a popup overlay? When I use inspector, the div with ui-widget-overlay is what is selected ... $(".ui-widget-overlay).on("click", function () { alert("HEY"); });
[15:53:32] <guideX> well.. $("ui-widget-overlay").on("click", function() { alert("HEY"); });
[15:54:17] <guideX> well.. with the .
[15:54:23] <guideX> $(".ui
[15:54:31] <say2joe> try event delegation instead.
[15:54:37] <guideX> hmm ok
[15:54:58] <say2joe> $(document).on("click","."ui-widget-overlay"", function() { alert("HEY"); });
[15:55:12] <say2joe> oops. too many quotes — but you get the idea.
[15:55:19] <guideX> yeah cool, i'll try that thanks
[15:56:10] <say2joe> the element you're binding too is mostly likely not yet in the DOM when binding the event.
[15:56:42] <guideX> yeah it appears after in the html
[15:56:46] <guideX> is that the problem?
[15:56:56] <guideX> possible
[15:56:57] <guideX> y
[15:57:12] <say2joe> well, if delegation works, then yes, that would be the problem.
[15:57:33] <JesperA> Dumb question but doesnt it kind of waste cpu for the client to keep looking for an element all the time on a page when using event delegation and/or .on?
[16:03:16] <shoky> JesperA: that's not how delegation works. it only sets the event handler once, on the selector you told it to. then it relies on event-bubbling of the events from the descendant items where the event originates
[16:03:23] <bakers> Can I use a JQueryUI dialog to display some HTML?
[16:03:44] <bakers> I want to call dialog() and have the popup be another URL called via ajax
[16:04:11] <shoky> bakers: if you can put it in a <div>, you can put it in a dialog
[16:04:39] <guideX> wow this thing refuses to work heh
[16:04:41] <JesperA> shoky oh ok, that makes much more sense :P
[16:10:12] <shoky> guideX: whut?
[16:10:25] <JesperA> shoky Is there a timeout for the "bubbling" of the events, for instance, when using .load to load new data that you want to use event delegation, what if for some reason the loading takes 10 seconds, will event delegation still work?
[16:11:07] <shoky> JesperA: no timeout
[16:13:15] <Ricaz> I need to do this: Get every <td> in a <tr>, then get the .html() of each of those, then convert those into <input>s. Is there a nice way of doing this?
[16:13:44] <Ricaz> And also if anyone has time, maybe there is a smarter way of doing what I'm doing code-wise (php/js)
[16:14:21] <snover> contenteditable="true"
[16:14:44] <JesperA> What is the reason behind that you dont use <input> from the beginning instead of <td>?
[16:15:27] <Ricaz> Well, here's the deal.. I have a table with items, each item has an edit button, and when it's pressed, a modal pops up to edit that entry
[16:15:41] <ezakimak> that's not the same as what you just described
[16:16:01] <Ricaz> No, but I guess what I described is one way of doing it
[16:16:15] <Ricaz> So I want to figure out which item was pressed, then generate a form from that
[16:16:15] <ezakimak> well pick one, and we can help :)
[16:16:33] <Ricaz> Yeah, that was my second question, anyone have ideas of how to do this differently?
[16:16:47] <ezakimak> why not make them inputs to begin with?
[16:17:02] <ezakimak> <td><input><button></td>
[16:17:08] <Ricaz> Because it displays a long list of items, and it has to be pretty
[16:17:11] <ezakimak> don't even need the button
[16:17:56] <ezakimak> well, you could bind dblclick handler to toggle contenteditable attribute
[16:18:24] <Ricaz> So text turns into <input>s? oO
[16:18:24] <ezakimak> and then listen for enter or onblur to remove it
[16:18:32] <ezakimak> no, it's just editable
[16:18:40] <ezakimak> it doesn't alter your DOM nodes afaik
[16:19:03] <ezakimak> but you could use inputs and just style them how you want
[16:19:17] <ezakimak> you can make a text input look just like anything else
[16:20:36] <Ricaz> So you want all the fields to be inputs, and when activated, editable?
[16:20:58] <ezakimak> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Content_Editable has two example pages linked at the bottom
[16:21:19] <ezakimak> that's one way
[16:21:29] <axsuul_> Can anyone recommend how I can trigger an event if an element's class changes? Cause bootstrap has this radio button thing that adds an active class to button and I want to trigger an event when this happens
[16:21:57] <Ricaz> Well, that's nice
[16:22:03] <Ricaz> How well supported is it?
[16:22:08] <axsuul_> I can't necessarily bind to the click event for this button because of race condition because the active class isn't necessarily added yet
[16:22:34] <Ricaz> I still really want the modal, though. Do you recon generating a form from the table would be the easiest way of doing this?
[16:22:36] <shoky> Ricaz: as to your first question.. var inputs = $('tr > td').map(function() { return $('<input>').val( $(this).text() ) })
[16:23:32] <Ricaz> shoky, cool!
[16:24:07] <guideX> omg final solution: http://jsfiddle.net/jasonday/6FGqN/
[16:24:09] <ezakimak> axsuul_, how does bootstrap add the class?
[16:24:10] <guideX> took forever
[16:24:21] <guideX> for closing jquery dialog model popup D:
[16:25:00] <ezakimak> call dialog("close")
[16:25:43] <ezakimak> axsuul_, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1950038/jquery-fire-event-if-css-class-changed
[16:26:00] <shoky> guideX: why not what say2joe told you to do..
[16:26:09] <guideX> I tried it, it wasn't working
[16:26:22] <guideX> It looked correct, but for some reason I just can't bind to it
[16:27:32] <shoky> guideX: http://jsfiddle.net/6FGqN/405/
[16:27:42] <shoky> used .delegate since you're using an ancient jquery version
[16:28:01] <guideX> I tried that too
[16:28:10] <guideX> this part wouldn't work jQuery(document).delegate('.ui-widget-overlay', 'click', function () {
[16:28:27] <guideX> I was just doing alert("HEY"); before on that, but it  wouldnt popup
[16:28:45] <guideX> I figure it's a jquery dialog popup thing
[16:28:55] <shoky> seems fine in the fiddle
[16:29:21] <guideX> yeah it looks perfect
[16:29:33] <guideX> and usually would work fine, but not with this jquery dialog
[16:29:48] <guideX> I think it's because jquery dialog popup and overlay doesn't exist until you trigger it to exist?
[16:30:12] <shoky> that doesn't matter with event delegation
[16:32:10] <kba> I might just not be able to see the forest for the trees, but how do I submit some JSON data with jQuery? I don't want an AJAX request.
[16:32:25] <kba> I want to do a plain and simple POST submit to another page.
[16:32:48] <shoky> kba: put json into one of your form's inputs?
[16:32:51] <coldhead> ?post
[16:32:51] <bot-t> jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[16:33:14] <kba> coldhead: That's AJAX.
[16:33:24] <coldhead> then what shoky said
[16:33:42] <kba> shoky: And then what? The data is being generated when the form button is pressed.
[16:33:54] <coldhead> $('#hidden_json_input').val( JSON.stringify( some_obj ) ); $('#someform').submit();
[16:34:05] <shoky> ^
[16:34:26] <kba> So I should just create a hidden form... I see, thanks
[16:35:50] <Ricaz> If I have a field (taken from db), can I truncate it without /actually/ changing the value, so I can use the same field and get the original content?
[16:37:46] <relipse> anyone in here write jquery plugins a lot?
[16:38:06] <coldhead> ben_alman sure does
[16:38:13] <dock9_> I'm having trouble getting anything but class C behavior (no formatting) out of jquery mobile in Firefox 3.6.
[16:38:21] <dock9_> (I only ask because OLPC has a couple million of them deployed)
[16:38:56] <dock9_> Are there any docs on how to troubleshoot it?
[16:41:20] <r1chard> It seems like jQuery encodes AJAX request data in ... PHP-specific format.
[16:41:27] <r1chard> Why was this done?
[16:41:37] <coldhead> because a lot of people use PHP
[16:41:38] <shoky> r1chard: how so?
[16:42:02] <r1chard> shoky, if I pass an array or nested objects it encodes it like this foo[bar]=123
[16:42:03] <coldhead> shoky: presumably the [] name mangling
[16:42:07] <r1chard> Right.
[16:42:14] <r1chard> coldhead, can I override this?
[16:42:34] <shoky> o, that
[16:42:48] <coldhead> sure, build an object to your taste and .post() that
[16:42:54] <coldhead> or avoid []s :)
[16:43:03] <awc737> say I have multiple .image divs inside a .container
[16:43:12] <awc737> and I do var active = $('.image.active')
[16:43:28] <awc737> how can I get which Nth .image element that is within .container?
[16:43:33] <kba> JSON.stringify seems to give bad output, I get a syntax error when trying to parse it
[16:43:42] <coldhead> it really shouldn't do that kba
[16:43:46] <kba> Is this common? Or is there a common work around?
[16:43:48] <coldhead> can you jsfiddle this?
[16:43:53] <kba> Well, it really does.
[16:44:05] <kba> My entire code? No, not exactly
[16:44:07] <coldhead> ?index @ awc737
[16:44:07] <bot-t> awc737, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[16:44:09] <kba> But I can how you the output
[16:44:18] <relipse> ben_alman: u there?
[16:44:22] <r1chard> coldhead, how would I post JSON encoded form instead of URL encoded
[16:44:22] <coldhead> a reduced test case would be nice
[16:45:07] <coldhead> r1chard: $.post('aidsaidsaids.cgi', {some_name: $('#some_name').val(), other: $('#other').val()})
[16:45:18] <coldhead> that may not help your specific problem, i am guessing
[16:45:41] <r1chard> coldhead, I mean JSON encoded, not url-encoded
[16:46:04] <awc737> thanks coldhead
[16:47:00] <coldhead> r1chard: $.post('aidsaidsaids.cgi', {json: JSON.stringify({some_name: $('#some_name').val(), other: $('#other').val()})})
[16:47:09] <coldhead> that's pretty gross, do it nicer
[16:47:22] <r1chard> Well but that's "wrapping" it in URL-encoded form :P
[16:47:30] <coldhead> it really should
[16:47:39] <coldhead> it should be a JSON representation of a JS obj
[16:47:43] <coldhead> no URL encoding
[16:47:56] <coldhead> maybe i'm the wrong person to help, it's my first day using jQuery
[16:47:59] <coldhead> i'll be quiet now
[16:48:02] <r1chard> Heh.
[16:48:14] <r1chard> coldhead, thanks coldhead
[16:52:09] <kba> The probably was simply that my backend automatically escaped the input and then didn't understand how to JSON decode it. It works after I removed the slashes.
[16:52:49] <coldhead> ah, the old "slashes" chestnut
[16:52:54] <coldhead> sorry i wasn't more help
[16:52:57] <coldhead> i hate the visit
[16:53:33] <kba> appreciate the effort
[16:58:36] <naeluh> Hi
[16:59:46] <naeluh> Hi was wondering is there a way to create a select list in jquery that uses json to populate and take unlimited values
[17:05:36] <coldhead> naeluh: i am not aware of any built-in way to do that
[17:05:41] <coldhead> there may be a plugin you could google for
[17:05:48] <coldhead> but it would not be too hard to do it oneself
[17:06:10] <naeluh> ok yeah I found this http://www.texotela.co.uk/code/jquery/select/
[17:06:36] <naeluh> coldhead: but I could populate a select list with json that is correct right ]
[17:06:39] <coldhead> this has the flavour of the approach http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1502649/jquery-getjson-populate-select-menu-question
[17:06:43] <naeluh> I  saw that on stack overflow
[17:06:45] <coldhead> yes it sure is, naeluh
[17:06:59] <coldhead> anything is possible if you can imagine it, that's what being a mad scientist is all about
[17:07:00] <relipse> Can I make this into a jquery plugin: http://jsfiddle.net/relipse/CaVsd/ ?
[17:07:37] <naeluh> coldhead: yeah I just figure the json output would change from a few least to a few more things like that
[17:07:54] <naeluh> coldhead: anything is possible
[17:08:25] <naeluh> I wish I could bring back dinosaurs
[17:08:32] <coldhead> relipse: i have no objection to you pluginifying this
[17:08:43] <coldhead> might want to var scope your variables though so they're not globals
[17:08:45] <relipse> i'm asking if its worth it
[17:08:59] <relipse> i need it to be pretty portable
[17:08:59] <coldhead> of course it's worth it
[17:09:06] <coldhead> for your own reuse and edification if nothing else
[17:10:32] <relipse> ben_alman: what do you think of making this into a jquery plugin: http://jsfiddle.net/relipse/CaVsd/ ?
[17:11:22] <relipse> come on jquery plugin coders, help me out give me an opinion
[17:12:01] * coldhead = chopped liver
[17:12:15] <relipse> not saying that at all
[17:12:21] <relipse> i just was hoping more than 1 person would answer
[17:12:38] <coldhead> i kid, we're all good :)
[17:12:45] <relipse> before i embark on this crazy endeavor
[17:12:48] <coldhead> my opinion is practically worthless anyway
[17:12:59] <relipse> mine is even more worthless
[17:13:01] <relipse> to be honest
[17:13:43] <coldhead> we should go for a beer sometime
[17:14:31] <guideX> mine is the most worthless
[17:16:18] <relipse> no mine is more worthless than the most worthless
[17:16:56] <coldhead> INCEPTION
[17:16:58] <relipse> coldhead: have you made a lot of plugins?
[17:17:06] <guideX> wow
[17:17:08] <coldhead> none as intensive as yours
[17:21:16] <naeluh> coldhead: I ll have  abeer with you
[17:21:17] <CaptainBlaze> hey guys, got a question
[17:21:25] <naeluh> a beer*
[17:21:38] <naeluh> quesception
[17:21:40] <CaptainBlaze> trying to make some information about books collapsable on the click of 2 buttons
[17:21:47] <CaptainBlaze> one expands
[17:21:51] <CaptainBlaze> one collapses
[17:22:13] <CaptainBlaze> however, when i click expand, it expands the info on all books
[17:22:21] <CaptainBlaze> and when i click collapse, it all dissappears
[17:22:23] <CaptainBlaze> http://jsfiddle.net/Q8PsK/
[17:22:29] <CaptainBlaze> not sure if that fiddle will help
[17:22:35] <CaptainBlaze> but hopefully it makes it a little clearer?
[17:22:56] <CaptainBlaze> am at a bit of a loss, only been using jquery for 2 hours now.
[17:24:09] <coldhead> CaptainBlaze: it's my first day too
[17:24:33] <CaptainBlaze> :)
[17:24:42] <CaptainBlaze> coldhead: what do you think so far?
[17:24:51] <coldhead> ME LIKEE
[17:24:56] <alainus> in a succession of parents with a certain .class, is there any way to get the last one ? (the one that's farthest away)
[17:25:09] <alainus> or upper
[17:26:14] <coldhead> CaptainBlaze: http://jsfiddle.net/Q8PsK/1/
[17:26:21] <coldhead> i think you need to use this and closest
[17:26:35] <coldhead> to isolate the specific .book you're interested in
[17:26:46] <CaptainBlaze> ok.
[17:26:50] <CaptainBlaze> will give it a go and let you know.
[17:26:50] <coldhead> ?closest @ CaptainBlaze
[17:26:51] <bot-t> CaptainBlaze, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[17:27:05] <CaptainBlaze> ah cool!
[17:27:15] <CaptainBlaze> i can see myself getting to like jquery alot.
[17:27:21] <coldhead> alainus: .parents('.someclass').last() maybe?
[17:27:35] <coldhead> i'm not sure what order parents() returns elems in
[17:27:41] <coldhead> you'd have to try it and see
[17:28:47] <alainus> coldhead, right. Thanks!
[17:29:00] <CaptainBlaze> coldhead: it works!
[17:29:11] <CaptainBlaze> nice, just got to fix the collapse thing now
[17:29:21] <CaptainBlaze> as it collapses everything and pretty much removes the element
[17:29:23] <coldhead> good luck
[17:29:24] <CaptainBlaze> i find it pretty funny
[17:29:28] <CaptainBlaze> but i don't think the users will
[17:31:13] <relipse> type '1' if you have written at least 5 jquery plugins?
[17:32:38] <relipse> guess i'm on my own
[17:32:40] <relipse> what the hey
[17:34:32] <PREFIX|> i dont even know what a jquery plugin is!
[17:38:13] <abjorn> relipse: my jquery plugin counts as the most on the basis that it's the best plugin of all time https://github.com/Abjorn/jquery-wiggle
[17:39:00] <relipse> i was looking for some somewhat professional jquery plugin writers
[17:39:07] <relipse> that could help me write this
[17:39:26] <relipse> this: http://jsfiddle.net/relipse/CaVsd/ ?
[17:39:27] <boytoy> lordie lord
[17:39:35] <coldhead> wiggle is a+ professional
[17:39:37] <boytoy> thats a party plugin right there :)
[17:39:40] <coldhead> i've used it in production
[17:39:49] <relipse> you used what in production?
[17:39:55] <boytoy> hehe sure is
[17:40:04] <relipse> why is your nickname boytoy?
[17:40:06] <coldhead> i used the wiggle production
[17:40:11] <coldhead> wiggle plugin in*
[17:40:16] <coldhead> i think im having a stroke
[17:40:22] <coldhead> and i'm not talking about my underpants
[17:40:23] <relipse> reminds me of hamsterdance.com
[17:40:24] <boytoy> play it next to the surround sound
[17:40:34] <abjorn> coldhead representin'
[17:40:35] <boytoy> a lot of people are bound to hook up
[17:40:49] <boytoy> relipse: well i provide services to the ladies
[17:40:52] <abjorn> and yeah i dont see why you couldnt do that as a plugin, relipse
[17:41:05] <relipse> ok thanks i'll get started
[17:41:11] <YammYcoding> anyone called me?
[17:41:37] <abjorn> yes, i called your phone, why didnt you answer?
[17:41:50] <YammYcoding> it's my mirc blinked :)
[17:41:54] <YammYcoding> hehe
[17:42:51] <relipse> how do i grab the first <ul> that is a child of a <li>
[17:42:58] <relipse> ONLY the first
[17:43:14] <abjorn> ?first
[17:43:15] <bot-t> .first(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the first in the set. http://api.jquery.com/first/
[17:43:28] <coldhead> $('li ul:first')
[17:43:32] <abjorn> ^ or that
[17:44:59] <relipse> ok thanks
[17:45:02] <relipse> i did .first()
[17:45:42] <relipse> what is a mind-game?
[17:45:45] <relipse> besides chess
[17:48:52] <abjorn> tetris
[17:50:04] <YammYcoding> guys
[17:50:19] <YammYcoding> when i write that, $('#foo').parent('.values .price')[0].innerHtml, how it reads?
[17:50:40] <YammYcoding> go to #foo parent, then find .values .price ?
[17:51:11] <relipse> is DraggableTwoLevelTree a good plugin name or should it be lowercase?
[17:52:43] <relipse> i'm doing $(this).each(function(){ , how do i make sure this is a 'UL' element?
[17:52:55] <relipse> inside the .each(0
[17:53:35] <shoky> .is('ul')
[17:54:34] <acidjazz> .is(yourmom)
[17:54:39] <shoky> YammYcoding: no, what you described is $('#foo').parent().find('.values .price')
[17:55:11] <relipse> this.tagName was suggested in stackflow
[17:55:27] <YammYcoding> my line tells it to do what instead?
[17:56:06] <YammYcoding> it goes to parent and try use a .values in parent itself?
[17:56:35] <shoky> YammYcoding:  go to #foo, and find its parent only if the parent is itself a '.values .price' element
[17:56:50] <relipse> how do i make subfunction in a jquery plugin?
[17:57:19] <YammYcoding> aaah then i want it to go back to parent and select the sibling .price from where $(this) is at,
[17:57:43] <shoky> relipse: a jquery plugin is just a function.. you make functions as you normally do
[18:00:11] <shoky> relipse: and for common plugin patterns, as usual, see http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[18:01:00] <wamatt> howdy :)
[18:01:49] <relipse> how do i .addClassIfNotAlreadyExists() ?
[18:02:11] <wamatt> havent used JQ before, so bit of a learning curve. what might be the best way to select all the div's that contain a matching an attribute, lets say "data-confirm", and then i want to remove all those attributes, from all the divs
[18:02:27] <wamatt> what might the best approach be for that?
[18:04:34] <relipse> does .addClass() check if the class is already added?
[18:06:01] <shoky> relipse: you don't need to check yourself, it won't be added twice
[18:06:21] <relipse> ok thanks
[18:07:15] <relipse> you ever realise that your life is just worthless
[18:07:29] <tw2113> why would i do something silly like that
[18:08:11] <shoky> at least twice a day
[18:08:13] <guideX> was before, still is, why realise it when I can live in denial
[18:08:28] <tw2113> shoky, i heard you do every moment before you enter the room :D
[18:08:49] <shoky> ^_^
[18:09:00] <tw2113> jk everyone!
[18:09:13] <tw2113> you all don't drive shoky to drink regular pop over diet
[18:09:18] <tw2113> that honor belongs to me
[18:10:08] <shoky> drinking or driving?
[18:10:27] <relipse> no i mean really, apart from every accomplishment you've ever had, or the fact that you have a decent job doing stuff that you like, including all that you still know your life is worthless?
[18:10:29] <tw2113> no that's coldhead's honor, the driving
[18:10:49] <tw2113> relipse, it's all subjective
[18:11:01] <tw2113> i'd think worthlessness over people who do asp.net coding
[18:11:07] <relipse> no i mean you come to the point where you realize what is truly defines you as worthless
[18:11:09] <tw2113> but they may love it, and think the same of my WordPress coding
[18:11:37] <tw2113> worthless to who
[18:11:49] <relipse> what is absolute worthlessness to you
[18:11:56] <tw2113> bacon
[18:12:05] <shoky> :-O
[18:12:39] <relipse> absolute worthlessness is when you are an utter failure in regards to God and realize that sin has overtaken your life and made you worthless
[18:13:09] <coldhead> um wow
[18:13:16] <coldhead> might wanna switch to decaf there, buddy
[18:13:37] <tw2113> that's not real coffee coldhead
[18:13:52] <shoky> i know i'm buying bacon tomorrow. thx tw2113
[18:14:24] <tw2113> going to whisper into the bacon's packaging "you're not worthless, you're my squishy"
[18:14:33] <coldhead> <3
[18:15:31] <shoky> :D
[18:23:16] <relipse> how do i continue to the next $.each() item?
[18:23:18] <relipse> retunr?
[18:23:20] <relipse> return?
[18:23:53] <tw2113> continue
[18:24:00] <tw2113> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/continue
[18:24:12] <coldhead> http://bit.ly/10qYHGS
[18:25:04] <tw2113> there goes your hero coldhead ?
[18:25:15] <coldhead> and how <3
[18:26:13] <relipse> is Draggable2LevelTree a valid plugin name?
[18:26:37] <tw2113> this is how i picture coldhead looking from now on http://www.anorak.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/steve-coogan.jpg
[18:26:40] <relipse> i meant $().each(function(){  if (blah){ return; }  } ); ?
[18:27:09] <tw2113> continue moves on to the next iteration
[18:27:13] <coldhead> that's pretty apt
[18:27:14] <tw2113> break stops the loop completely
[18:27:25] <coldhead> return false
[18:27:39] <cjb> Hi!  I have a bootstrap modal that I brought up with "$('#somemodal').modal('show');", and when I call $('#somemodal').modal('hide') to make it go away, the modal disappears but the background stays dark gray (which happened when the modal came up) instead of white.  Any ideas?
[18:27:57] <cjb> The modal doesn't have any buttons.
[18:29:13] <relipse> <ul><li><ul><li><li></ul></li><li>no children</li></ul> how do i iterate through all sub- li nodes without getting the grandchildren li nodes
[18:29:54] <relipse> i need to number all my li nodes with a level
[18:29:59] <relipse> 0 1 or 2
[18:30:05] <relipse> depending on how deep they are
[18:32:04] <coldhead> relipse: you probably want to use > in your selector
[18:32:10] <coldhead> to target immediate children
[18:44:42] <relipse> $('li > ul > li', $this_ul)
[18:45:22] <relipse> that should be first level
[18:45:55] <relipse> $('li > li > li', $this_ul) should be second level
[18:45:59] <relipse> correct?
[18:47:33] <coldhead> that will only work if you have LIs immediately inside LIs
[18:47:35] <coldhead> and you shouldn't
[18:47:41] <coldhead> you'd have ULs between them
[18:47:50] <coldhead> or all hell breaks loose
[18:47:57] <coldhead> like in that song "all hell breaks loose"
[18:49:25] <relipse> does this look right: $('li > ul > li > ul > li', $this).data('d2lt_item_level', 2);
[18:50:17] <coldhead> yes
[18:53:48] <YammYcoding> guys how i see what $(this).parent() have inside?
[18:53:55] <YammYcoding> in the watcher
[18:54:13] <coldhead> console.log( $(this).parent() )
[18:54:16] <coldhead> should be some help
[18:54:18] <tw2113> coldhead, http://thecodinglove.com/post/49258098914/investigating-variables-at-breakpoint
[18:54:29] <YammYcoding> i added this to the watcher, but it says undefined
[18:54:54] <coldhead> so true
[18:54:59] <coldhead> i don't know what this watcher is
[18:55:08] <YammYcoding> the chrome debugger thing
[18:55:19] <YammYcoding> hmm Sources
[18:55:35] <tw2113> the console?
[18:56:50] <relipse> ok continue doesnt work in jquery
[18:56:53] <relipse> i knew it didnt
[18:56:57] <relipse> but i tried it nonetheless
[18:57:04] <relipse> return works ftw
[18:57:07] <coldhead> return true vs return false
[18:57:13] <relipse> ty coldhead
[18:57:14] <coldhead> to continue or break, resp.
[18:57:16] <coldhead> as documented
[18:57:36] <coldhead> it would be really weird if continue worked
[18:57:44] <YammYcoding> ya in the console
[18:57:46] <tw2113> was worth the guess earlier
[18:58:29] <relipse> ok another thing that didn't work
[18:58:41] <relipse>  parent > child  got ALL child nodes
[18:58:49] <relipse> including grandchildren
[18:59:17] <relipse> is there a way to ONLY get children, NOT grandchildren?
[18:59:28] <shoky> $('ul > li')  will get all <li>'s that are direct-children of <ul>'s  whether they are nested or not
[18:59:36] <coldhead> shoky++ ^
[18:59:39] <relipse> then why didnt it work
[18:59:53] <relipse> http://jsfiddle.net/relipse/CaVsd/22/ <-- go down to 2nd tree
[19:00:14] <shoky> much too much code, no thanks
[19:00:15] <relipse> inspect the middle level
[19:00:22] <relipse> no actually its not
[19:00:28] <relipse> its like 10 lines
[19:00:55] <tw2113> looks like a 259 line plugin
[19:01:01] <relipse> $('li > ul > li.d2lt_item', $this).data('d2lt_item_level', 1).addClass('d2lt_level1');
[19:01:08] <relipse> you arent scrolling down
[19:01:17] <relipse> and yes the plugin will be big but thats ok
[19:01:20] <tw2113> shoky is talking about the WHOLE thing
[19:01:26] <tw2113> not just the part you're focusing on
[19:01:34] <shoky> that will find li.d2lt_item's that are children of ul's that are children of li's
[19:01:40] <relipse> why does $('li > ul > li.d2lt_item', $this).data('d2lt_item_level', 1).addClass('d2lt_level1'); get ALL nodes
[19:01:59] <coldhead> because that selector is matching too much
[19:02:00] <shoky> so if you have this structure:   li > ul > li.2dlt_item > ul > li.2dlt_item
[19:02:08] <shoky> it will find both of those li.2dlt_item
[19:02:10] <coldhead> you probably need to add a class to the parent ul
[19:02:18] <coldhead> and mentiont hat in the selector
[19:02:23] <relipse> thats what i'm trying to figure out
[19:02:29] <relipse> i need to add classes based on what level node they are
[19:03:02] <relipse> shoky: exactly how do i eliminate that 2nd group
[19:05:30] <shoky> relipse: instead of:  $('li > ul > li.d2lt_item', $this)    do:   $(this).find('> li > ul > li.d2lt_item')   i guess :\
[19:05:46] <shoky> relipse: important bit is the first > that i added
[19:05:47] <relipse> oh i see
[19:05:53] <relipse> never knew you could do that
[19:05:59] <relipse> thanks
[19:08:44] <coldhead> cold hands, no gloves
[19:10:01] <shoky> glovehead
[19:10:58] <relipse> http://jsfiddle.net/relipse/CaVsd/25/ <-- ok i fixed it what do you think
[19:11:13] <coldhead> i don't like the font
[19:13:58] <the_voice-_> hi
[19:14:11] <relipse> coldhead: what font?
[19:14:12] <the_voice-_> I am trying to use qtip
[19:14:20] <the_voice-_> anyone have any experience with that?
[19:14:29] <coldhead> jsfiddle
[19:14:30] <shoky> relipse: are you going to continue doing that for all levels?
[19:14:39] <shoky> that sounds fun
[19:14:59] <relipse> shoky: its a 2level max tree
[19:15:04] <shoky> oh ok
[19:15:08] <relipse> so no i'm done
[19:16:41] <relipse> how do i iterate all nodes with a child class 'dl2t_level2' and all nodes without that class?
[19:17:08] <the_voice-_> in short I am trying to call a function that is in a "parent" document
[19:17:12] <the_voice-_> but it does not seem to find it
[19:17:28] <relipse> basicallly i want to iterate all level 1 nodes and figure out if they have any children or not
[19:48:31] <YammYcoding> guys $( function() {} )  is the same as $(document).ready( function() {} ) ?
[19:49:19] <18VAA2G1Q> Hello world, I am trying to update a table but when I insert the raw html into the DOM the formatting to the columns gets messed up.  Should I be calling "addClass" after the html has been inserted to style the table or should the DOM get updated with the insert?  Thanks.  https://gist.github.com/louism2/5493430
[19:49:31] <shoky> YammYcoding: yes
[19:49:37] <YammYcoding> aah okey then =)
[19:53:15] <Z3R0> what's with the \'s ?
[19:56:45] <coldhead> fair question
[20:03:02] <relipse> umm
[20:03:11] <relipse> how do i have persistant variables in a jquery plugin?
[20:03:43] <relipse> $().draggableTree();   and then later on $().draggableTree('finishDrop');
[20:03:53] <relipse> do i store them in each <ul> ?
[20:04:05] <coldhead> sigils
[20:04:08] <Z3R0> relipse: http://bit.ly/14S6tC9
[20:05:49] <relipse> yeah i guess that works
[20:06:03] <relipse> but wouldnt it be more accurate to store a function inside a data attribute?
[20:06:10] <relipse> for a specific tree  <UL> ?
[20:06:25] <relipse> hm
[20:06:32] <YammYcoding> guys. In $.ajax( { success:     function listproducts( data ) {//foo }... I can call an app.listproducts(data) instead? i tried it didn't work
[20:08:01] <YammYcoding> i mean, must i define the function only in the success: ?
[20:10:04] <YammYcoding> success: app.listproducts(data),    it says 'data undefined'
[20:10:38] <shoky> success: app.listproducts   might work better
[20:10:44] <Z3R0> YammYcoding try success: function(data) { app.listproducts(data); }
[20:10:45] <Z3R0> ?
[20:11:04] <YammYcoding> Z3R0 dirty trick?
[20:11:12] <Z3R0> if it works?
[20:11:44] <coldhead> if you think that's dirty you're going to have a very rough time of things
[20:11:53] <coldhead> that's almost the acme of elegance
[20:12:55] <YammYcoding> hehe acnme
[20:13:36] <null__> Is there a sibling selector? say I have elements p and div, but I have a target (this) on p but I want to select div through a sibling selector?
[20:14:07] <Z3R0> null__ .siblings() ?
[20:14:07] <coldhead> ?nextall
[20:14:08] <bot-t> .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[20:14:10] <coldhead> ?prevall
[20:14:10] <bot-t> .prevAll([selector]): Get all preceding siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prevAll/
[20:14:15] <coldhead> or siblings, si si si
[20:14:15] <Z3R0> ? siblings
[20:14:16] <bot-t> .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[20:14:34] <null__> for some reason I thought it would be ~
[20:14:55] <null__> thanks for the direction
[20:15:48] <coldhead> ~ would be right in an actual selector
[20:15:54] <coldhead> $('a ~ div')
[20:16:08] <coldhead> CSS is so cray
[20:17:33] <YammYcoding> meh it didn't work :/
[20:17:56] <YammYcoding> the ajax never ends
[20:18:27] <coldhead> so true :(
[20:19:48] <relipse> how do i store a variable for a particular <ul>
[20:22:36] <YammYcoding> shoky, when you do success: app.listproducts, is the same as success: function(data) { app.listproducts(data) }  ?
[20:22:53] <YammYcoding> like the data gets global or something?
[20:23:01] <Z3R0> relipse what do you mea nm/
[20:24:38] <shoky> YammYcoding:  it's similar, not the same.  the data is not global anyway, jquery passes it to whatever function you give it for 'success'
[20:24:41] <YammYcoding> var = $('ul')
[20:24:51] <shoky> relipse: .data()
[20:25:25] <YammYcoding> so even if i not pass it, it's passed anyway ?
[20:25:45] <Cache_Money> I'm trying to update a <p> every second for 3 seoncds, emulating a countdown timer.  i.e. 'The game starts in 3 seconds' (pasuse 1 second), 'The game starts in 2 seconds' (pause)...  What am I doing wrong? http://pastie.org/7746145
[20:25:56] <shoky> YammYcoding:  you don't pass it anywhere to the function that's placed as "success", only jquery passes it there
[20:26:03] <omg|its|otr> I have $("form").submit(function() {return false; }); on my page but forms are still being submitted and going to new pages as per normal
[20:26:08] <omg|its|otr> Any idea what's wrong?
[20:27:11] <coldhead> are you using $(document).ready() ?
[20:27:23] <coldhead> it may be that you are running that code before the form is on the page
[20:27:35] <coldhead> in which case it won't have that handler attached
[20:29:23] <relipse> no i mean there is a bunch of ULs and I need a function for each specific UL
[20:29:24] <shoky> Cache_Money:  1000*secs
[20:29:29] <relipse> how do i store that funciton?
[20:29:46] <relipse> myplugin_vars[my_ul]['myfunction']
[20:29:52] <relipse> how do i store my_ul ?
[20:29:58] <relipse> assign a random data variable to it?
[20:30:04] <relipse> and use it as an index?
[20:30:12] <shoky> Cache_Money: also when you do a simple for loop, by the time the setTimeout callback is called, the loop is already over. (so the counter is already at the end)
[20:30:49] <omg|its|otr> coldhead, it's in a document.ready, yes.
[20:31:22] <omg|its|otr> If I replace the html in the form with jquery, that works, so I'm not referencing the form wrong. The event is just not being stopped for some reason
[20:36:26] <Cache_Money> shoky: you're right.  i accidentally left out the second argument (ie 1000) but I'm still not getting the effect that I want
[20:37:38] <shoky> Cache_Money: http://jsfiddle.net/3w9rC/
[20:42:41] <Cache_Money> shoky: thanks
[21:26:13] <YammYcoding> this can be transformed into an event listener in like var app= { mylistener } ?    $('#main').on('change', '.quant', function() {}
[21:28:45] <roswell> YammYcoding, doubtfully yes, via eval() i guess, but why?
[21:29:10] <YammYcoding> eval? hmm i mean like converting the code to be an event listener to do the same thing
[21:29:48] <YammYcoding> I have other events listenner in app, i wondered if i code move that code into there.
[21:30:16] <YammYcoding> because without it, there is a piece of code outside the app place.
[21:30:22] <YammYcoding> see, http://yammy.com.br/phonegap/helloworld/
[21:31:12] <YammYcoding> and i'm trying to refactor the code a little bit
[21:36:20] <YammYcoding> like what it have in document.addEventListener( 'deviceready', this.deviceready, false );	
[21:36:48] <YammYcoding> i wonder if I could ask for a on change for the selects
[21:45:40] <relipse> OMGOSH
[21:45:42] <relipse> guESS WHAT
[21:45:46] <YammYcoding> what?
[21:45:50] <relipse> remember about 4 hours ago i asked about making a plugin
[21:45:56] <YammYcoding> hm
[21:46:01] <relipse> i finally did it: http://jsfiddle.net/relipse/CaVsd/ <-- check it out and give me pointers
[21:46:16] <YammYcoding> Oo but plugin for what?
[21:46:27] <relipse> click and you'll see
[21:46:31] <relipse> top code is without plugin
[21:46:34] <relipse> bottom code is with a plugin
[21:47:23] <YammYcoding> ah cool stuff
[21:47:51] <relipse> i'll say
[21:48:29] <YammYcoding> you wrote all that?
[21:50:04] <relipse> http://jsfiddle.net/relipse/CaVsd/40/
[21:50:05] <relipse> check it out
[21:50:13] <relipse> even using a (completeDrag) method
[21:50:29] <relipse> i wrote a lot of it, the original tree was created by the url given
[21:50:43] <relipse> i just pluginified it
[21:50:45] <relipse> coldhead
[21:50:47] <relipse> check it
[21:50:48] <relipse> http://jsfiddle.net/relipse/CaVsd/40/
[21:50:54] <YammYcoding> very cool =)
[21:51:08] <relipse> now i'm gonna github it
[21:51:08] <YammYcoding> hey maybe you know how to make the event listener thing
[21:51:18] <relipse> what event listener thing?
[21:51:38] <YammYcoding> i wonder how to transform this into an event listener function call
[21:51:49] <relipse> transform what?
[21:52:07] <YammYcoding> $('#main').on('change', '.size', function() {
[21:52:23] <YammYcoding> to become like this
[21:52:25] <YammYcoding> document.addEventListener( 'DOMContentLoaded', this.getproducts, false );	
[21:52:50] <YammYcoding> i wanted to have the listener in the app. function instead
[21:53:01] <YammYcoding> it's in a document ready place outside the app
[21:53:19] <YammYcoding> like var app = { ... }
[21:53:37] <YammYcoding> myabe i can add some on change listener
[21:55:26] <YammYcoding> any clue?
[21:56:20] <relipse> i have no idea what you are talking about
[21:56:25] <relipse> coldhead
[21:56:26] <relipse> did you see?
[21:56:42] <coldhead> oh no i didn't
[21:56:51] <coldhead> i am having terrible abdominal pain
[21:56:57] <coldhead> thing my ovaries are flaring up or something
[21:57:08] <coldhead> oh right, Yammy
[21:57:14] <coldhead> i have no idea what that guy is talking about
[21:57:14] <coldhead> sorry
[21:57:21] <coldhead> way beyond my intelligence
[21:57:28] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[21:57:43] <YammYcoding> pain lower the belly to the right side?
[21:58:05] <YammYcoding> ask someone to hit on your back at this level, if you scream, it's apendicitis.
[21:58:22] <YammYcoding> then run to hospital.
[21:58:28] <coldhead> thanks doctor yammy
[21:59:04] <YammYcoding> i had it. i fainted several times in pain for 4 days before i knew what it was
[21:59:52] <coldhead> i am pretty sure this is polycystic ovaris
[22:00:08] <YammYcoding> hmmm then i duno how bad it hurts
[22:00:18] <YammYcoding> but at first my pain was all over the belly
[22:00:29] <YammYcoding> and it bloated like i gained 2kg
[22:00:40] <YammYcoding> in a few days span
[22:00:53] <YammYcoding> one more day i was dead
[22:01:06] <coldhead> a case for early intervention
[22:01:29] <YammYcoding> it's serious thing..
[22:02:17] <coldhead> clearly
[22:02:33] <relipse> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/relipse/CaVsd/40/
[22:02:38] <relipse> remember the plugin we talked about
[22:02:43] <relipse> well i finally made it
[22:02:46] <relipse> first version right there
[22:02:52] <coldhead> when you say "finally"
[22:02:59] <coldhead> do you mean "after a couple of hours"?
[22:03:05] * YammYcoding gives a golden star to relipse :)
[22:03:13] <relipse> i meant after about 3 or 4 hours of coding yes
[22:03:19] <coldhead> hey this is pretty great
[22:03:27] <coldhead> way to be
[22:03:36] <coldhead> i am no way near smart enough for this kind of thing
[22:03:43] <coldhead> THANK GOD for people like you
[22:03:47] <relipse> i've been working on drag drop groups and subgroups since sunday
[22:03:52] <YammYcoding> tell me about it.. i'm here suffering on first mobile app :)
[22:04:04] <relipse> yamm: i'm using titanium for an iphone/droid app at work
[22:04:23] <YammYcoding> is it good, lightweight, easy, and packages in phonegap?
[22:04:25] <coldhead> i love it when you say subgroups
[22:04:30] <coldhead> you sound like a number theorist
[22:04:32] * coldhead quivers
[22:04:39] <relipse> YammYcoding: i actually switched from phonegap to titanium
[22:04:44] <relipse> phonegap was seeming a bit slow
[22:04:55] <YammYcoding> really? i thought pg was the way to go :)
[22:04:56] <relipse> workable, but slow
[22:05:06] <relipse> try titanium, also coding in javascript
[22:05:11] <relipse> works great on android and iphone
[22:05:13] <YammYcoding> i got interested more in the builder for many devices at once.
[22:05:22] <relipse> titanium is many devices at once
[22:05:30] <relipse> its same idea as phonegap
[22:05:33] <YammYcoding> it builds the apps for me?
[22:05:36] <relipse> yes
[22:05:39] <YammYcoding> for free?
[22:05:41] <relipse> yes
[22:05:45] <YammYcoding> hmm interesting
[22:05:47] <relipse> appcelerator
[22:05:59] <relipse> irc channel is dead but their forums they answer fast
[22:06:56] <YammYcoding> if i took 3 weeks with irc help to make that pizza app, with forums i will take over a year :)
[22:07:36] <relipse> yeah support is a nice thing, sadly #titanium_app is mostly idle
[22:07:40] <YammYcoding> i'm girl, brain works differently and slowly for spatial math and logics :)
[22:08:04] <coldhead> i find that highly sexist
[22:08:23] <YammYcoding> what your brain math cpu solves in 10 seconds, i take an hour to solve :)
[22:08:55] <YammYcoding> but it is what it is, the men actually have much better math calculator inside :)
[22:09:30] <relipse> pretty much the world finds things sexist that were meant to be
[22:09:39] <relipse> for example man is meant to be the hunter and gatherer and provider
[22:09:44] <YammYcoding> i remember from college, i had to study my eyes out to grade 8.5 , and my boyfriend were never in class, arrived 10 minutes before exam, checked on my notes, and graded 9.0
[22:10:04] <coldhead> "meant to be"? what the hell are you talking about
[22:10:14] <relipse> the way God created and intended it
[22:10:19] <relipse> men are supposed to be men, women women
[22:10:29] <YammYcoding> not meant to be, it actualy is better hunter and gatherer :)
[22:11:11] <YammYcoding> discovery channel has tested it :) gave a map to girls, and a map to guys. guys lost the path several times, men arrived in a flash.
[22:11:23] <relipse> guys and mne?
[22:11:25] <relipse> men?
[22:11:41] <YammYcoding> men x women test.
[22:12:18] <YammYcoding> then discoverychannel gave 5 tasks in a kitchen to guys and girls. girls finished in a flash, men took forever to complete.
[22:12:24] <relipse> hahah
[22:12:37] <YammYcoding> the genes are there, we can't deny our nature :)
[22:12:52] <coldhead> if some almighty actually intended all this then I WOULD LIKE TO FILE MANY MANY COMPLAINTS
[22:12:54] <YammYcoding> ah girls lost the path*
[22:13:31] <YammYcoding> hehe
[22:13:46] <YammYcoding> no need for complainings, just commenting :)
[22:14:58] <coldhead> COMPLAINT 1: WHY IS THE AMUSEMENT PARK LOCATED BETWEEN TWO SEWAGE OUTLETS
[22:15:12] <coldhead> COMPLAINT 2: DEATH? SERIOUSLY?
[22:15:19] <coldhead> COMPLAINT 3: GRAVITY! GUH
[22:15:38] <YammYcoding> also, men are made to see far ahead, their eye sight sees farther and narrower in long distance.  we have wider eye sight for short distance, we have trouble looking into distance, but we see more degrees around our head.
[22:16:38] <YammYcoding> well 2 am. i gotta get out of here :)
[22:16:42] <YammYcoding> nite nite folks!
[22:18:34] <coldhead> goodnight forever, Yammy
[22:19:37] <YammYcoding>  \o\..........
[22:19:50] <jBryan> hi, how can I make a next/prev button that can navigate inside a json object?
[22:20:04] <YammYcoding> forever why?
[22:20:17] <YammYcoding> i can't die today yet :) gotta code to finish :)
[22:20:17] <coldhead> oh sorry, that was a typo
[22:20:24] <coldhead> yes but *i* might die
[22:20:26] <YammYcoding> ah rofl
[22:20:27] <coldhead> hopefully <3
[22:20:44] <YammYcoding> don't scare me like that, words do have power :)
[22:20:58] <sacho> jBryan, an object isn't perfect for this. Why not use an array?
[22:21:00] <YammYcoding>   \o\..............
[22:21:06] <MickRip> I cannot code while half asleep
[22:21:21] <jBryan> how can I convert object to array?
[22:21:28] <jBryan> json object
[22:21:50] <sacho> Depends on what you need from the object.
[22:22:01] <sacho> Do you need both property names and values?
[22:22:08] <jBryan> both
[22:22:11] <MickRip> jBryan: loop it in jquery .. no convenient way
[22:22:26] <jBryan> where can I post the code so you can see it?
[22:22:29] <sacho> If so, one way would be for ..in array.push({ name: property_name, value: property_value})
[22:22:34] <jBryan> jsfiddle?
[22:22:43] <MickRip> jsfiddle best way
[22:22:49] <jBryan> ok wait
[22:23:14] <MickRip> although, are you really sure you need to turn it into an array? Is this a last resort?
[22:23:59] <jBryan> http://jsfiddle.net/8UUES/
[22:25:05] <jBryan> maybe if that's the best thing to do
[22:26:07] <MickRip> what are you having trouble with?
[22:26:36] <jBryan> the next/prev function thing
[22:28:12] <MickRip> jBryan: return count = count ?
[22:28:32] <jBryan> so I can use it inside prev function
[22:28:39] <jBryan> is it wrong?
[22:30:36] <sacho> why not just return count?
[22:31:05] <jBryan> will that replace the var count outside the function?
[22:31:07] <MickRip> jBryan: the scope of count should be visible inside that anonymous function
[22:31:44] <sacho> jBryan, no.
[22:32:31] <coldhead> so full of laksa
[22:32:35] <jBryan> hmmm, the use of next function is to increment the count so when I pressed the prev button it will decrement it
[22:32:45] <jBryan> based on count var
[22:32:55] <MickRip> coldhead: I hate that, I know exactly how you're feeling, like a laksa balloon
[22:34:20] <MickRip> jBryan: since count is part of the scope of the page, I'd just declare it on line 3 and be done with it. (and maybe name it something more obvious?)
[22:35:13] <sacho> jBryan, That's fine. Why are you returning count = count, though?
[22:35:21] <sacho> The assignment has no effect.
[22:35:30] <MickRip> jBryan: Javascript confuses me sometimes, but from what I gather, count = count is an expression and will always equate to true, because count = count no matter what count is
[22:35:50] <sacho> It will only evaluate to true if count's value is true.
[22:36:37] <jBryan> so how can I use the count inside next function?
[22:36:39] <MickRip> sacho: so, if count = 0 (or false?) .. then 0 = 0 is false? or (null = null) = false?
[22:36:40] <jBryan> return it?
[22:37:14] <sacho> MickRip, the value of an assignment expression is the value of its right-hand-side, in this case, count.
[22:37:45] <relipse> i can't seem to make this <ul><li><ul><li></li></ul></li></ul> structure look any good can someone please modify the css to make this look good: http://jsfiddle.net/relipse/e78Bt/13/
[22:37:54] <relipse> can someone make my tree look pretty
[22:37:56] <MickRip> jBryan: it's a scope thing. Just change the value of count inside the function and since it was declared outside the function, it'll affect the value
[22:37:57] <sacho> jBryan, if you want to return count, just use "return count"
[22:38:10] <sacho> otherwise, I don't understand your question
[22:38:23] <sacho> relipse, #css
[22:38:23] <jBryan> ok I'll just return count
[22:46:06] <nathanbz> anyone know of a pluging for interstititla adverts for iphones
[22:47:29] * coldhead shudders
[22:49:20] <Andrew_R> what does interstititla mean?
[22:50:33] <coldhead> i gather it's some kind of syndicated ad platform
[22:50:40] <coldhead> to keep you informed of local hot singles
[22:50:44] <coldhead> in your area
[22:50:45] <coldhead> 100%
[22:50:51] <coldhead> online now
[22:50:59] <nathanbz> Wel
[22:51:04] <coldhead> free free free
[22:51:11] <nathanbz> I just want a fullsized advert for our iphone app
[22:51:27] <nathanbz> so they goto our website on an iphone BAM fuck u user look at our add :)
[22:51:33] <coldhead> ah, i used to want things
[22:51:37] <coldhead> those were the days
[22:52:41] <nathanbz> do you just need things these days
[22:53:07] <coldhead> i have no idea
[22:53:11] <coldhead> things just seem to happen
[22:53:12] <Andrew_R> position: fixed; top: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; -- I missed the jquery part somewhere :p
[22:53:19] <coldhead> i suppose in time this too will pass
[22:53:20] <relipse> how do i make the drag drop move around cursor?
[22:53:26] <coldhead> cursor: move;
[22:55:09] <nathanbz> andrew u need to set the height and width still :p
[22:55:40] <nathanbz> I was just hoping there was some magic plugin
[22:57:19] <Andrew_R> nathanbz: no you don't set height and width with that css - top, bottom, right, left are your anchors, the height and width are automatic
[22:58:05] <louism2__> Hey all, is there a way to convert a string to a variable reference.  I am trying to use a loop to dynamically reference a list of sequentially named variables.  Thanks.  https://gist.github.com/louism2/5493956
[22:59:43] <coldhead> louism2__: http://jsfiddle.net/ZHB5r/
[23:00:16] <louism2__> coldhead: ahhhhh
[23:00:17] <sacho> louism2__, That's generally a xy problem - you are asking something that doesn't usually make sense to do, while you're really trying to do something else(and thinking what you're asking is a good solution)
[23:00:27] <coldhead> you probably want this[col_+ind]
[23:00:40] <coldhead> this['col_'+ind], e'en
[23:00:58] <sacho> note that coldhead's solution won't work for function scope variables since there's no way to address the function scope record
[23:01:13] <coldhead> i admit it, i am shit
[23:01:18] <sacho> louism2__, instead, why not use an array?
[23:01:37] <louism2__> sacho: I could, just trying to figure out if what I was doing was possible
[23:01:41] <madprops> I have an input with a long string inside of it. I set focus and move the cursor to the end of the string but the beggining of the string is always shown, instead of the last bit. It moves as soon as I start to type but any idea on how to make it move to the end without typing?
[23:01:52] <sacho> louism2__, Sure. It's possible to do with eval.
[23:01:57] <sacho> That doesn't make it a good idea.
[23:02:07] <Z3R0> madprops use a text area? lol
[23:02:41] <madprops> hmm
[23:02:58] <Z3R0> why use input if it's going to be out of range on the input ?
[23:02:59] <sacho> madprops, how are you moving the cursor?
[23:03:18] <madprops> $('#inputpath_ftp').focus().val($("#inputpath_ftp").val());
[23:03:47] <madprops> Z3R0, for aesthetic reasons
[23:04:29] <madprops> i guess
[23:04:34] <madprops> but it might not be a bad idea actually
[23:08:05] <louism2__> sacho: how would you do it using eval?  I'm not too familiar with it
[23:10:23] <sacho> louism2__, I wouldn't.
[23:11:36] <coldhead> good chat
[23:49:45] <relipse> can someone please help me find the javascript error problem in this code: https://raw.github.com/relipse/jquery-dd2leveltree/master/jquery.dd2leveltree.js
[23:50:17] <relipse> says line 331
[23:58:55] <relipse> see my beautiful code here: with delete drop zone: http://jsfiddle.net/relipse/94PYZ/
[23:59:04] <relipse> any suggestions?
[23:59:08] <relipse> for a nice plugin?
