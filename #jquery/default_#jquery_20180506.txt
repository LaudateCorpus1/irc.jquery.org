[11:28:10] <irondew> Hello, this is my script: https://pastebin.com/2qGRsTcv I wanted it to print date in dd/mm/yyyy format, how can I do this? Now it prints it like this: Tue Jun 05 2018 17:24:28 GMT+0200 (CEST)
[15:03:50] <ngharo> idmistir: look at some Date object docs, or use a library like moment.js to do date string formatting for you
[15:04:07] <ngharo> oops, wrong person... and they're gone already.
[15:04:24] <ngharo> hiding joins/parts is a blessing and a curse :)
[16:50:14] <Urbanecm> Hi, I'd like to know why $('table').attr is "undefined" even I have exactly one table in my HTML
[16:50:50] <Urbanecm> Also it's interesting that $( document ) is undefined as well
[16:51:00] <Urbanecm> So no $( document ).ready(function() { code } works
[16:51:50] <Woet> Urbanecm: show the entire code and entire error.
[16:52:27] <Robdgreat> Plese don't paste it into the channel, though
[16:52:38] <Urbanecm> Woet, https://ctrlv.cz/juK1
[16:52:52] <Robdgreat> right on
[16:54:29] <Urbanecm> Woet, https://tracker.wikimedia.cz/tickets/ is the page I have the problem at (it is slow, I know, it's another problem I'm solving, but isn't related to Jquery apparently)
[16:54:50] <Urbanecm> Woet, is it enough?
[16:54:55] <Woet> Urbanecm: and does $('table') work?
[16:55:31] <Urbanecm> Woet, if https://ctrlv.cz/uTb9 means it works...
[16:56:58] <Woet> Urbanecm: nope
[16:57:08] <Woet> Urbanecm: it should return a jQuery object, it's not.
[16:57:14] <Urbanecm> Woet, do you know why?
[16:57:25] <Woet> Urbanecm: doesn't seem like you're loading jQuery.
[16:58:07] <Urbanecm> Woet, I am, see https://ctrlv.cz/XnSv
[16:58:47] <Urbanecm> And BTW, if I don't load jquery, even $ should  be undefined
[17:00:56] <Woet> Urbanecm: $('table').attr works fine on your tracker link.
[17:01:14] <Woet> Urbanecm: https://s.woet.me/9Zn5YkIhkQ.png
[17:03:46] <Urbanecm> Woet, well, it is because I turned off caching
[17:04:10] <Woet> Urbanecm: ok?
[17:06:55] <Urbanecm> In Firefox. Chrome's broken, at least on my side Woet
[17:07:47] <Woet> Urbanecm: fine here, https://s.woet.me/TYI6pMQ5tm.png
[17:08:12] <Urbanecm> why...
[17:08:14] <Urbanecm> thank you
