[00:50:01] <Dirkos> How do i get all "next" tr from a current node? Where this is the current TR node.
[00:50:06] <Dirkos> I want all the next siblings from it
[00:50:36] <ravenzz> nextAll() ?
[00:51:06] <ravenzz> ?nextAll @ Dirkos
[00:51:07] <bot-t> Dirkos, .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[00:51:36] <Dirkos> ah thanks didnt knew that one yet :)
[01:03:23] <gotwig> I use contains to match the text of an element, how can I exactly match only the text I specifiy in :contains ?
[01:07:35] <gotwig> when I use :contains("John") I want that it only selects the element, which EXACTLY matches John, but not John1, John_ etc.
[01:07:38] <gotwig> how can I do that
[01:10:11] <Clorith> :is
[01:11:49] <okdamn> hey all
[01:12:03] <okdamn> how do i put onsuccess:function(){} in a $.post() ?

[01:15:49] <quetzakubica> Hello. Guys if do something like that $('script').load(function() { console.log('loaded'); });, then callback is called when all scripts are loaded?
[01:16:00] <quetzakubica> I do*
[01:31:46] <Cork> quetzakubica: no it's called once per script element that finish loading after you bind the event listener
[01:32:13] <Cork> quetzakubica: and for most situations, it will most likely miss most of them
[01:33:13] <quetzakubica> ok, I get it, thanks
[01:45:22] <quetzakubica> Cork: but $(window).load will wait for all scripts, right?
[01:46:11] <Cork> quetzakubica: yes
[01:47:06] <quetzakubica> Cork: then I wonder why people use requirejs, instead of window.load
[01:47:36] <Cork> quetzakubica: cause they wan't to to the management of what scripts to load on the client side
[01:47:56] <Cork> *to do the
[01:48:41] <quetzakubica> hmm, but for me it looks like all scripts are loaded always anyway
[01:48:54] <Cork> you don't use script tags in requirejs
[01:49:03] <quetzakubica> yes, I'm using requirejs
[01:49:11] <quetzakubica> In a quite big app
[01:49:28] <Cork> you load requirejs through a script tag, and then you load the additional scripts through calls to requirejs
[01:49:28] <quetzakubica> But I'm not convinced
[01:49:51] <Cork> quetzakubica: i find the points of requirejs shaky too
[01:50:21] <quetzakubica> I see the point of not waiting for other assets, like images
[01:50:25] <quetzakubica> in window.load
[01:50:33] <Cork> load will wait for images
[01:50:41] <Cork> load will wait for everything
[01:50:48] <quetzakubica> yes, this what I mean
[01:50:55] <quetzakubica> that's require js advantage
[01:51:02] <Cork> not really
[01:51:28] <quetzakubica> why?
[01:51:39] <Cork> the biggest problem i see with requirejs is that you will cause loads of extra net calls
[01:51:53] <quetzakubica> yes
[01:51:54] <Cork> when you could have prepared this forhand, and then sent the scripts in one go
[01:52:17] <Cork> and what you want to wait for in js is domready
[01:52:21] <quetzakubica> I didn't get to the point of compressing js scripts yet
[01:52:33] <Cork> and if your code is written correctly you don't need any of the other waitings
[01:52:51] <Cork> i wasn't talking about compressing
[01:52:58] <Cork> i was talking about concating the files
[01:53:03] <quetzakubica> I meant that :P
[01:53:13] <Cork> if you have a site with say 50 small js files
[01:53:34] <Cork> that means your page will cause 51 connections to the server
[01:53:37] <Cork> just for the page+scripts
[01:53:41] <quetzakubica> I know, requests are bottlneck always
[01:53:48] <Cork> browsers normally limit the number of connections to ~8
[01:53:53] <Cork> so you will get a delay
[01:54:29] <Cork> if you instead concat the images into one, you get one big file, one connection (two counting the original page)
[01:54:42] <Cork> and the scripts can count on the rest of the scripts beeing there when they run
[01:54:59] <quetzakubica> I understand
[01:55:11] <Cork> compressing the js is an additional step where intents, linebreaks, commends is removed
[01:55:38] <Cork> and additional step is where you shorten the names of the functions and variables
[01:55:57] <gotwig> can you help me? want to filter text for a specific one, and than remove the element
[01:55:59] <gotwig> http://jsfiddle.net/3yYbp/
[01:56:18] <Cork> and finally obfuscate, is where you run a preparser of the script before it becomes runnable
[01:56:53] <quetzakubica> preparser?
[01:57:22] <Cork> quetzakubica: they basically eval a function that generates the final script
[01:57:47] <Cork> gotwig: you mean you want to remove all users that start with John?
[01:57:52] <Cork> or what?
[01:58:16] <gotwig> Cork: oups. I want to remove all users which exactly match "John Doe"
[01:58:38] <gotwig> Cork: I used :contains before that, but it removed John Doe_ as well. I want that it only matches "John Doe"
[01:58:43] <gotwig> not John Doe_
[01:59:25] <quetzakubica> Cork: I always wondered how debugging works in obfuscated code
[02:00:13] <gotwig> Cork: when I use this, I also have to select the next tag, span, after that I can do .text() on it
[02:00:53] <Cork> gotwig: http://jsfiddle.net/3yYbp/1/
[02:01:13] <Cork> quetzakubica: they don't use the obfuscated code when they debug
[02:01:13] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/troakudgttkobkofcksjpq - this is working when not making a post, but in the post success I'm not getting $(this) to be checked
[02:01:21] <gotwig> Cork: please not by class name, but only span :>
[02:01:53] <Cork> nisseni: var self = $(this); on line 2, then use self in line 6
[02:01:54] <gotwig> Cork: and it doesnt even work
[02:02:02] <Cork> gotwig: it does...
[02:02:22] <gotwig> Cork: yeah it does
[02:02:24] <Ulrar> hi, with jquery mobile I have a form with submit button on which I applied data-role, data-icon and stuff like that. Works fine on loading, but on some user action I get those forms updated in ajax, and those jquery things seems to be ignored totaly
[02:02:48] <Ulrar> Is there some magic function I should call to reapply jquery mobile stuff ?
[02:02:55] <stevesum> Hi! I have a question about jquery.ui 1.10.3. I use the autocomplete on a norwegian website, and after I switched from the 1.8.22 to this new version I found that the menu elements is not highlighted on apple devices when I touch them. Do anyone know solution on this problem?
[02:03:28] <gotwig> Cork: thx
[02:03:30] <nisseni> Cork: still doesn't work, self is getting unchecked as well
[02:03:56] <Cork> nisseni: also don't use attr for properties
[02:04:00] <Cork> use prop
[02:04:24] <nisseni> Cork: that did the trick, thanks
[02:05:43] <mobasher> hi everybody. I am using jquery ajax in my site and I get this alert "Request failed: -error" some times  and i get it when i click on a menu item and want to load a page. why?
[02:06:13] <mobasher> the page inside works fine but i get this wrror some times and i dont know exactly why cause it
[02:06:30] <Cork> ?p @ mobasher
[02:06:31] <bot-t1> mobasher, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:07:57] <mobasher> http://jsfiddle.net/4GaJ3/
[02:08:55] <mobasher> I get it on 3 of my page they are not regular so I dont know what is the reason
[02:09:02] <Cork> mobasher: too much php in there, check so it isn't the cause
[02:09:59] <mobasher> Cork: can you explain it? i did not undrestand your answer
[02:10:10] <mobasher> I am using cakephp and this is the view file
[02:10:33] <Cork> mobasher: try pre render the php and see if you can reproduce the problem with js + static html files
[02:18:14] <mobasher> Cork: I think it doesn't have anything to do with the php parts . the error showed after sometime I think there is a confilction or some other types of errror in my js code but i dont undrestand it
[02:19:00] <Cork> mobasher: it still needs to be split up so it is possible to read what it does
[02:22:06] <mobasher> Cork: I dont know how to do taht
[02:23:14] <Cork> mobasher: the bas of the problem is that you have to many sources of errors, as you have php generating html, and it generates the js, and then the js runs towards the html
[02:23:23] <Cork> it can be a problem on any of those sources
[02:23:30] <Cork> so you need to reduce it
[02:25:04] <ryorky1> if I have a function like this:  Date.prototype.getMonthNameShort = function(lang), how do I call it?
[02:25:27] <Cork> (new Date()).getMonthNameShort()
[02:25:37] <HardDisk_WP> Hey all
[02:25:50] <Cork> if you want to not have it related to a date add it to Date instead of Date.prototype
[02:26:27] <HardDisk_WP> I have a <ul> with fixed height and overflow-y:scroll. so far so good, but can I determine whether the bottom border of the individual li's is visible or overflowed?
[02:27:05] <Cork> HardDisk_WP: no, you could have to calculate the top of each element, and then add the height of the element
[02:27:10] <Cork> could==would
[02:28:38] <ryorky1> Cork:  tnx
[02:29:37] <HardDisk_WP> Cork, how do I calculate the top? just iterate through all li's and add .height()?
[02:29:50] <Cork> ?.position

[02:32:38] <Cork> _pingu: check if the patch is in the source code?
[02:34:48] <_pingu> Cork:  where cann i see the patch?
[02:36:04] <Cork> _pingu: you have the changeset where the bug was fixed
[02:37:16] <_pingu> Cork: I know, but its not linked to a diff
[02:40:23] <Cork> _pingu: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/3ef7a9683b95fa334ab75458a531bb263782c748
[02:40:28] <b-ot> Cork: Timmy Willison (2mon 4w ago): Remove unnecessary usage of getAttributeNode(). Fixes #12072.
[02:43:08] <_pingu> Cork: Hmm. A earch for the function disableScript in Firefox does not find something. There is also no file named manipultaion.js. I'am using tapestry jquery, wich includes v1.7.2. could itbe, that it excludes that file?
[02:43:51] <Cork> _pingu: manipulation.js is the source file, it is later compiled into jquery.js
[02:45:20] <_pingu> Cork: There is no function named disableScript in jquery-1.7.2.js
[02:46:39] <Cork> _pingu: http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js line 6308
[02:47:22] <Cork> _pingu: so ya, it was fixed in 1.9/2.0
[02:47:40] <Cork> (sorry 1.10/2.0)

[02:57:06] <pranav> hey.. is DOMElement functions available in jquery.. i can't find a good tutorial which lets me guide parsing xml with composite nodes. please help!
[02:57:42] <Cork> pranav: how are you getting the xml?
[02:57:47] <Cork> ajax?
[02:58:04] <pranav> its in file
[02:58:05] <_pingu> Cork: :-)
[02:58:26] <Cork> pranav: web doesn't have files
[02:58:39] <Cork> it has resources, and the question was how are you loading them to the page?
[02:59:03] <Cork> (resource ~= url)
[02:59:09] <pranav> Cork: XMLHttpRequestObject.open("GET", "xmldoc.xml", true);
[02:59:26] <Cork> XMLHttpRequestObject?!?
[02:59:30] <Cork> ?g mdn XMLHttpRequestObject
[02:59:30] <b-ot> Cork: XMLHttpRequest - Web API reference | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest
[02:59:33] <bot-t1> Cork, XMLHttpRequest - Web API reference | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest
[02:59:42] <Cork> pranav: what's XMLHttpRequestObject ?
[03:00:14] <pranav> Cork: its just for making proper request. I will later do: var xmlDocument = XMLHttpRequestObject.responseXML;
[03:01:42] <Cork> pranav: if you use $.ajax instead, and your server is configured correctly
[03:02:01] <Cork> you will get a parsed dom object from jquery without any extra fiddling
[03:02:25] <Cork> $.ajax('xmldoc.xml').done(function(xmlDoc) {});
[03:03:44] <pranav> Cork: thanks :)
[03:04:01] <pranav> but, should i use-> var year1attr=xmlDoc.getElementsByTagName("year") [0].getAttribute('id');
[03:04:03] <Cork> it depends on the server knowing what .xml is though
[03:04:10] <Cork> no need
[03:04:20] <pranav> that was my main question.. :/
[03:04:22] <Cork> just do $(xmlDoc).find('year')
[03:04:46] <aaronmcadam> you can set the mimetype otherwise
[03:04:51] <pranav> Cork: I can't find a API reference to those kinds of functions :/
[03:05:00] <pranav> I wanted to look to the list once..
[03:11:08] <pranav> Cork: no answer for me ? :|
[03:12:02] <pranav> is it the same selectors that we use for elements. that will work fine for my xmlDoc ?
[03:12:58] <Cork> pranav: yes
[03:13:14] <pranav> hmm.. :)
[03:13:18] <Cork> when it is parsed it is just dom, not difference
[03:13:30] <Cork> you don't have xml dom and html dom in a browser, just dom
[03:13:53] <pranav> Cork: aah.. yes.. i should have tried and known by surprise.. :|
[03:13:54] <pranav> lol
[03:14:18] <pranav> Thanks but :)
[03:18:08] <okdamn> sorry why this not working? http://pastebin.com/JnjmgZpw
[03:18:26] <okdamn> it returns the runThis.clearInterval() is not a function :(
[03:20:01] <Cork> ?g mdn clearInterval @ okdamn

[03:21:50] <olukyanov> hello, i have a form with about 100 lines and few columns each line. I post all that data over xhr to a php script like this: formDataVal: JSON.stringify($(adminCatalogProductEntrance.saveDataForm).serializeArray()) (using $.post). now over the server side i get the following array when i json_decode that post value : http://pastebin.com/wqcbc6TP  as per see it's quite f..ed up. How should i
[03:21:51] <olukyanov> send the form data so i can get an easier way to format this on the php side. I need an association like this: array(array('prodID'=>213, 'newstock' => 5, 'buyprice' => 272.23), array('prodID'=>214, 'newstock' => 2, 'buyprice' => 21.13)....) back in php...
[03:23:09] <Cork> ?g jquery serailizeObject @ olukyanov
[03:23:09] <b-ot> olukyanov: Sorry, no results for ‟jquery serailizeObject @ olukyanov”.
[03:23:11] <bot-t1> olukyanov, Difference between serialize and serializeObject jquery - Stack ... - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17488660/difference-between-serialize-and-serializeobject-jquery
[03:23:21] <Cork> ...
[03:23:44] <Cork> olukyanov: https://github.com/hongymagic/jQuery.serializeObject
[03:25:03] <olukyanov> Cork so no other way of doing this ?
[03:25:28] <olukyanov> until now i have build the json myself like this:
[03:25:46] <Cork> olukyanov: you could take the serializeArray structure, generate an object in the form you want, and then stringify it
[03:25:46] <olukyanov> http://pastebin.com/kieDRNqp
[03:25:55] <olukyanov> but i don't know if thats clean
[03:26:04] <Cork> don't generate the json...
[03:26:19] <olukyanov> but i can't miss anything in there
[03:26:38] <Cork> it's very easy to mess up
[03:26:53] <olukyanov> i know it's not ok to manually build the json but i think i'm safe there since only numeric values are allowed and i validate that on the server side
[03:26:57] <Cork> and that code doens't handle all the different element combinations you can get from a form
[03:30:13] <olukyanov> Cork that pluggin only has one line of code hehe
[03:30:49] <Cork> olukyanov: uh, no it doens't https://github.com/hongymagic/jQuery.serializeObject/blob/master/jquery.serializeObject.js
[03:31:44] <AlexIT> @Cork hey, Could you take a look and tell me why the variable 'hpl' won't calculate anything? or whats happening there cause it only says 1 + 3 + 5 = 135 http://jsfiddle.net/AjBez/
[03:32:10] <Cork> AlexIT: parseInt
[03:32:27] <Cork> ?eval "1" + "3" + "5"
[03:32:31] <bot-t1> Cork: "135"
[03:32:53] <Cork> or parseFloat works too
[03:33:30] <AlexIT> @cork okay I'll try. thanks.. weird though, didn't require that for any other calculation (except that one which still cant be fixed by anything will debug it later)
[03:33:41] <Cork> AlexIT: also have you though about coming out of the 90's ?
[03:33:54] <Cork> there are this new thing called css where styling should be :)
[03:34:51] <AlexIT> @Cork I do not know CSS, nor have I been asked to learn it... just doing my job here T_T
[03:35:04] <Cork> uh, no i don't think you are
[03:35:14] <Cork> that page is horrible in it's structure
[03:36:31] <AlexIT> @Cork Horrible for being in the 90's?
[03:37:00] <AlexIT> @Cork It's not how the final project will look like if that's what you think lol.
[03:37:00] <Cork> horrible for using <font> <center> and similar yes
[03:38:00] <olukyanov> Cork now i'm getting the following (using that serializeObject) : http://pastebin.com/RTZcmv6M
[03:38:16] <olukyanov> but that is still ugly
[03:38:31] <Cork> why?
[03:38:50] <Cork> your form have 4 prodID elementsm so you get an array
[03:38:53] <olukyanov> because i need to parse the keynames as strings
[03:39:07] <olukyanov> the prodID is ok
[03:39:17] <olukyanov> but how do i associate the rest of the columns with that id ?
[03:39:18] <Cork> uh, ya, they are keynames...
[03:39:23] <Cork> keynames are strings
[03:40:14] <AlexIT> Aha, I don't have the time to learn it now, maybe I will when I finish highschool vacation, or at the end of this project. Really by now what I've accomplished *Which is about 12 of those calculators which can be inserted into the page easely* is considered good by him.
[03:40:20] <Cork> olukyanov: that depends more on how you have chosen to structure the form field names
[03:40:29] <olukyanov> yes.. but i would prefer that array to be something like [213] = > array('newstock'=>2....)
[03:41:12] <Cork> olukyanov: if you want a structure, not based on the field names, so generate an object with the structure you want
[03:41:18] <Cork> and then JSON.stringify it
[03:41:31] <olukyanov> http://pastebin.com/tJYUb3Sm
[03:41:38] <olukyanov> this is how i have my inputs
[03:43:08] <AlexIT> @cork But if you're willing to show me later I will be more than happy to learn.
[03:54:02] <AlexIT> @cork thank you.. weird though, it wasn't needed on any other calculator
[03:54:20] <AlexIT> @Cork (worked)
[03:55:15] <olukyanov> Cork : i did my inputs like this : <input type="hidden" name="row[{$values['product_id']}][prodID]" value="{$values['product_id']}" /> and now i get what i need : http://pastebin.com/wiYUFizh
[03:55:27] <olukyanov> of course using serializeObject
[03:59:32] <Cork> AlexIT: http://jsfiddle.net/AjBez/2/
[03:59:48] <Cork> still not perfect, but a lot better
[04:00:09] <sikor_sxe> hello, i am using the jquery.ui datepicker (inline), and i have the problem, that when i click prev or next month my url is suffixed with '#'. is there a way to prevent this?. Usually i bind click events on those pseudo-<a> elements and do event.preventDefault(), but this does not seem to work in this case. Anyone knows how to prevent those hash-symbols being appended to the url?
[04:08:51] <sikor_sxe> it's quite weird because it seems i cannot register click events on $('.ui-datepicker-next'). the handler is never called, when clicking on it :/
[04:10:00] <Cork> sikor_sxe: you might be selecting for the elements before they exist
[04:10:30] <sikor_sxe> oh, let's see...
[04:10:44] <AlexIT> @Cork Thanks for the model, does it remain on jsfiddle? for how long?
[04:10:56] <Cork> AlexIT: no time limit
[04:12:11] <sikor_sxe> Cork: no, the debugger console finds the -next element when the event is bound :/
[04:12:31] <Cork> is the event listener called when you click the link?
[04:12:34] <AlexIT> @Cork Alright, I'll study it later (Either when these are finished or later) *I already figured out the parseint parsefloat functions for which I'm greatful :)*
[04:14:23] <sikor_sxe> Cork: no it isn't
[04:14:36] <Cork> ?p @ sikor_sxe
[04:14:37] <bot-t1> sikor_sxe, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:14:45] <Cork> try make a working example of the problem there
[04:17:33] <drager> I'm currently wonder how I would add different levels for game. http://jsfiddle.net/drager/44jjd/ ideas?
[04:22:24] <sikor_sxe> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/XLLZP/. i think i know the problem. the event handler is called if you click next one time
[04:23:03] <sikor_sxe> then however the next/prev elements get recreated w/o event handlers
[04:23:21] <sikor_sxe> if you click prev, then next the event handler is not called
[04:23:36] <Cork> sikor_sxe: i can't see any hash tags added to the url http://fiddle.jshell.net/XLLZP/show/
[04:24:00] <MindSpark> hi, I have a few ul's that are identical and I want a click event on any li to reflect on their corresponding li's in the other ul's. I tried filter() but this only affects the clicked ul/li. any ideas?
[04:24:56] <Cork> $('ul').on('click', 'li', function() {}
[04:24:58] <Cork> opps
[04:25:01] <Cork> wait a min
[04:25:45] <MindSpark> cork, it would be something along:
[04:25:50] <sikor_sxe> Cork: you probably get that hash, when using custom prev/next Text
[04:25:51] <Cork> var uls = $('ul'); uls.on('click', 'li', function() { uls.children().eq($(this).index)); });
[04:25:58] <Cork> MindSpark: ^
[04:26:12] <Cork> sikor_sxe: can you try reproducing the problem?
[04:26:54] <MindSpark> ah, so combination of eq and index… that was going to be my next attempt. There's no other way to do this, huh?
[04:27:35] <Cork> MindSpark: well there is, but it would all be about the same effect
[04:27:49] <MindSpark> Cork: can you give me an example?
[04:28:09] <MindSpark> also, it possible to use the click() callback instead of on() ?
[04:28:14] <Cork> well you need to use index() it's the only way to get the offset
[04:28:29] <Cork> MindSpark: sure, but then you need to bind a LOT more event listeners
[04:28:38] <MindSpark> like how?
[04:28:47] <Cork> that code binds 2, if you use .click you bind one to each li you have
[04:29:12] <Cork> this code uses delegated event listeners
[04:29:58] <MindSpark> so it's generally better practice to use the on function?
[04:30:16] <Cork> it depends on what you are doing
[04:30:36] <Cork> on is a combination function, what i did before is the delegation part
[04:30:53] <Cork> so just using on instead of .click with no other changes won't give you anything
[04:31:11] <Cork> have a look at delegate see ?.delegate
[04:31:11] <bot-t1> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[04:32:29] <MindSpark> Cork: alright, thanks!
[04:35:13] <MindSpark> Cork: what is the difference between on() and delegate() ?
[04:36:05] <fesener_> hi everyone, I have a chatroom application and want to prevent some situations while posting, such as posting HTML code, posting too short messages, posting too long messages etc. , what should I use to do this ?
[04:36:19] <Cork> MindSpark: delegate is older; also on is a combination function, it has syntax for both .bind and .delegate
[04:36:53] <Cork> MindSpark: and .bind is the original function .click and similar shorthands pointed to
[04:36:58] <OnkelTem> Hi all! Is there a plugin for displaying nice modal dialogs with buttons like "Ok", "Back", "Agree" etc?
[04:37:05] <AlexIT> @feshner jsfiddle
[04:37:15] <OnkelTem> with simple API
[04:37:19] <fesener_> i dont have a jsfiddle aliex
[04:37:25] <fesener_> AlexIT*
[04:37:30] <MindSpark> Cork: so whether I use on, delegate or bind, doesn't make a difference?
[04:37:31] <AlexIT> @fesener jsfiddle
[04:37:36] <Cork> ?g mdn jquery ui dialog @ OnkelTem

[04:38:09] <AlexIT> @fesener http://jsfiddle.net/
[04:38:18] <fesener_> are you mocking me AlexIT ?
[04:38:20] <Cork> MindSpark: if you use the bind syntax for .on, bind or .click doens't matter of if you use the delegate syntax for .no or .delegate doesn't matter
[04:38:39] <Cork> MindSpark: but bind and delegate isn't the same thing
[04:39:13] <AlexIT> @fesener_  http://jsfiddle.net/ You can upload your code there, then post the link it gives you here
[04:39:37] <fesener_> its just an textbox input
[04:39:43] <fesener_> i cant post my code there it's node/socket code
[04:40:12] <fesener_> i just want to check some validations on a textbox such as cleaning HTML, checking input length and some other security things
[04:40:50] <stevesum> Anybody know the reason why the 1.10 ui autocomplete prevent the highlighting of the elements on iphone tap event? It worked well in version 1.8.22.
[04:42:19] <MindSpark> Cork: do you know what the difference is?
[04:42:37] <Cork> MindSpark: i've explained what the difference is
[04:42:48] <Cork> if you want to read up on it more read the link i gave you
[04:42:58] <AlexIT> @fesener_  well I dont know what security issues you are talking about but for your input length http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2702862/jquery-check-length-of-input-field
[04:43:14] <MindSpark> Cork, ok, thanks!
[04:44:00] <fesener_> AlexIT, lets say you have a textbox and when user presses enter while using that textbox, you append the content on the textbox to a div
[04:44:44] <fesener_> in that case you need to escape HTML codes, check if user posted abnormally large text and such, basic stuff, right ?
[04:44:58] <fesener_> i dont need any app specific checks, just these basic things
[04:45:29] <fesener_> i've found a couple plugins but they're way overkill for such simple purpose
[04:45:44] <fesener_> so I'm asking what should I do :)
[04:47:38] <MindSpark> Cork: another method would be to use each() on the uls, right?
[04:47:48] <AlexIT> @fesener_ mmm, I'm afraid I don't know that much. perhaps wait till a more.. advanced user can tell you, for makin your html code clean, I can see jsfiddle has a 'tidy up' option... hope those two links can help you a little at least.
[04:47:48] <Cork> no
[04:48:24] <Cork> MindSpark: you can do $('ul li').click() but that binds them directly on the lis instead
[04:48:28] <fesener_> AlexIT, ok, thanks for trying to help at least
[04:48:59] <MindSpark> Cork: what's the problem with that?
[04:49:06] <MindSpark> I mean, it would work, right?
[04:49:32] <AlexIT> @fesener_ my pleasure..
[04:51:13] <Cork> MindSpark: the link should go though that
[04:51:49] <MindSpark> ok, it's not working. Looks like it is caused by the embedded ul which has display set to none unless it is expanded
[04:52:23] <stevesum> anyone expert with ui autocomplete?
[04:53:30] <MindSpark> Cork: Here's my failed attempt http://pastebin.com/ec8mQA5P
[04:54:04] <Cork> uh, why are you each looping !?!
[04:54:50] <MindSpark> I don't know, I thought that would get the index correct
[04:55:17] <MindSpark> as in, if the 5th element has been clicked, I would have to get the fifth elem for each ul
[04:55:18] <Cork> MindSpark: the first code should work unless your code differ from what you explained
[04:55:32] <Cork> try generate a demo of what your doing see ?p
[04:55:32] <bot-t1> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/

[05:16:51] <Cork> MindSpark: the needed html is missing...
[05:16:56] <FernandoBasso> I am calling fancybox on static content. Then, I load some more stuff with ajax and re-init fancybox again. But I get "TypeError: $(...).fancybox is not a function". Any ideas?
[05:16:57] <chkpnt> Well... I'm trying upgrading from jquery 1.3.2 / jquery-ui 1.7.2. Let's see, if something explodes :-)
[05:17:22] <MindSpark> Cork: the html is generated by the first functoin
[05:17:28] <Cork> chkpnt: it most likely will, there is a lot of breaking changes between 1.3 and 1.7
[05:17:47] <Cork> MindSpark: no, cause it won't run as the selector doesn't match anything
[05:17:53] <MindSpark> Cork: ok, done
[05:18:57] <chkpnt> Are 1.10 and 2.0 compatible? Or works jquery-ui with the 1.x-branch only?
[05:19:23] <chkpnt> Uh, I see "jQuery 2.x has the same API as jQuery 1.x, but does not support Internet Explorer 6, 7, or 8. "
[05:22:31] <FernandoBasso> The problem happens if I trigger fancybox (clicking something) once and _then_ load more stuff with ajax...
[05:23:08] <FernandoBasso> If I load content with ajax first, then fancybox just works on the "old" content and on the new content.
[05:24:28] <MindSpark> Cork: ok, now the code works
[05:24:43] <MindSpark> on jsfiddle I mean, but not like I want it to
[05:24:49] <Cork> link?
[05:26:38] <MindSpark> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/LnRFw/4/
[05:30:59] * chkpnt is suggesting a "create download link" option for http://jqueryui.com/download, so one can easily use the link on a remote server and you don't need to download and retransmit the zip-file
[05:32:38] <Cork> MindSpark: http://jsfiddle.net/LnRFw/5/
[05:33:21] <Cork> MindSpark: though honestly i think you should be going to adding classes instead
[05:33:29] <MindSpark> Cork: wow! Thank you so much...
[05:33:32] <Cork> *goring for adding classes instead
[05:33:38] <MindSpark> how would I do that?
[05:34:50] <Cork> add a data-class="identifyer" and then $('main-menu').find('.' + $(this).data('class')).addClass()
[05:35:03] <Cork> (and identifyer should be in the class list too
[05:35:05] <Cork> )
[05:35:22] <lord4163> is it possible to ping through javascripts/jquery?
[05:35:52] <MindSpark> Cork: and then?
[05:36:07] <Cork> lord4163: not if you mean icmp ping no
[05:36:12] <Cork> MindSpark: and then what?
[05:36:21] <Cork> i gave you everything
[05:36:51] <MindSpark> yea, but why is this a better approach?
[05:36:52] <lord4163> Cork: Don't know what that is, have to check if a host is online or not.
[05:36:59] <Cork> MindSpark: much less looping
[05:37:21] <Cork> you would utilize the doms built in controls instead
[05:37:51] <Cork> lord4163: and icmp ping is what you send when you do a ping from the command line for example
[05:38:01] <Cork> lord4163: and no you can't do that from the web
[05:38:16] <MindSpark> Cork: do you mind showing me in my example? I am not sure how you would go about doing that
[05:38:45] <lord4163> Cork: So I should do it with PHP? I think it will slow the page down, maybe ajax?
[05:38:53] <Cork> lord4163: you could do something like $.ajax('/alive', { success: function() { alert('yes') }, error: function() { alert('no'); } });
[05:39:12] <lord4163> Cork: But they are no webservers the clients I want to ping
[05:39:24] <Cork> lord4163: if you don't have access to the third party server then ya, server side is the only thing you can do
[05:39:39] <Cork> lord4163: then you can't
[05:40:02] <Cork> you can't even count on having direct access to a client
[05:40:25] <Cork> it's most likely routed through at least one router
[05:41:29] <lord4163> Cork: yeah well networking is what I'm bad at :P so if there ain't a webserver or other service you can't ping it?
[05:42:05] <Cork> lord4163: js can only do tcp connections, so yes
[05:56:23] <AlexIT> Bye all!
[06:09:35] <RohanBhangui> hi guys i need to create a toggle fade animation for an image
[06:09:44] <RohanBhangui> kind of like a constant flash
[06:09:53] <RohanBhangui> but smotth
[06:09:56] <RohanBhangui> *smooth
[06:10:01] <RohanBhangui> any ideas how to do this?
[06:16:05] <kelsadita> hi
[06:16:47] <kelsadita> is the flag is not specified for the regular expression ....is global flag is the default one ?
[06:16:52] <kelsadita> *if
[06:17:51] <FernandoBasso> I really can't understand what is going on. I call fancybox after ajax content, and it works. But if I first click on a link that triggers fancybox, _then_ load the content, trying attach fancybox to the new content tells me that 'fancybox' is not a function.
[06:18:28] <FernandoBasso> I even tried this: https://gist.github.com/FernandoBasso/5717985
[06:22:41] <RohanBhangui> FernandoBasso: just a thought: why dont you design one from scratch?
[06:23:09] <RohanBhangui> also Jquery.post is no more used
[06:23:13] <RohanBhangui> its $.post
[06:23:22] <RohanBhangui> *jQuery
[06:23:44] <FernandoBasso> Design what from scratch?
[06:24:38] <RohanBhangui> ya that way you can customize yourself
[06:25:40] <RohanBhangui> ill give you some hints: since its an overlay, the div that you store the content in has to be a direct child of the body
[06:25:57] <RohanBhangui> div that you store content in is tehc otnent of the overlay
[06:26:01] <RohanBhangui> *the content
[06:33:25] <RohanBhangui> FernandoBasso: trying to create exmaple for you
[06:33:50] <FernandoBasso> Thanks.
[06:49:08] <RohanBhangui> FernandoBasso: this example is a demonstration that you dont need a plugin http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/xFhEA/6/
[06:49:29] <RohanBhangui> you can customize it to have images and other features of fancy box by writing them yourself
[06:50:16] <RohanBhangui> ding it without a plugin helps you understand whats happening and then you can use your ajax code the way you want
[06:50:21] <RohanBhangui> *doing
[06:53:16] <FernandoBasso> I see. Thanks a lot. I'll study the code.
[06:55:04] <RohanBhangui> if you have any questions
[06:55:05] <FernandoBasso> RohanBhangui: It is very nice. Thank you.
[06:55:09] <RohanBhangui> just ping me
[06:55:35] <FernandoBasso> Sure! Thanks once more.
[06:55:41] <RohanBhangui> FernandoBasso: as much as they are useful, i hate plugins cause i feel mindless. I like to create stuff from scratch
[06:56:00] <lasha> RohanBhangui: ME TOO!!
[06:56:21] <RohanBhangui> you tend to understand stuff better
[06:56:29] <RohanBhangui> cause its oyur logic not someone elses
[06:57:58] <FernandoBasso> RohanBhangui: I agree with you. I'm just no at that level yet. Also, I am working, so, I can't just spend much time "creating" things. They want me to get things done. When I am programming at home, things are a little different.
[06:58:27] <RohanBhangui> lol true i understand. I had to make this for a client
[06:58:36] <RohanBhangui> http://bronteapp.hostei.com/
[06:59:00] <RohanBhangui> FernandoBasso: ive used about half a dozen plugins
[06:59:23] <FernandoBasso> I would not even use a library if I were I better js programmer.
[07:01:15] <FernandoBasso> But I'll improve my javascript-fu overtime. It is the language I mostly like.
[07:02:25] <tamarche> jquery-fu!
[07:02:57] <RohanBhangui> lol
[07:04:19] <FernandoBasso> RohanBhangui: "Problem loading the page" (http://bronteapp.hostei.com/)
[07:04:28] <RohanBhangui> im fixing it
[07:05:01] <RohanBhangui> FernandoBasso: good to go! :)
[07:06:02] <RohanBhangui> FernandoBasso: just look at the csource and youll see the plugins i have used in <head>
[07:06:41] <FernandoBasso> I just saw them. :D
[07:07:11] <FernandoBasso> http://www.revestesul.com.br/orcamentos <-- My nightmare.
[07:09:35] <FernandoBasso> You design is nice.
[07:09:44] <RohanBhangui> lol thanks
[07:10:10] <RohanBhangui> you know what you should look at the site themforest, might be able to get some inspiration from those site templates for your next design
[07:10:27] <RohanBhangui> the link you posted the site looks decent
[07:11:09] <boytoy> the best theme is no theme just like the best design is the design you don't notice!
[07:11:25] <boytoy> had to get that off my chest
[07:11:28] <RohanBhangui> amen
[07:11:34] <RohanBhangui> no prob
[07:11:39] <boytoy> feeling much better now
[07:12:05] <RohanBhangui> FernandoBasso: make the links height less and consider merging the logo into the menu bar
[07:12:14] <RohanBhangui> boytoy: lol :P
[07:12:38] <RohanBhangui> is like the entire jquery channel snoozing or something
[07:12:52] <RohanBhangui> i still havent solved my question
[07:14:26] <dan2k3k4> what image slider do you guys use?
[07:14:46] <dan2k3k4> NiVo looks nice, I think I've used it before
[07:19:40] <RohanBhangui> dan2k3k4: http://www.slidesjs.com/
[07:19:58] <RohanBhangui> other wise you could create one from scratch
[07:20:48] <dan2k3k4> looks nice
[07:21:09] <dan2k3k4> would only need to remove the buttons below and set left/right to the middle sides
[07:23:17] <Al1> @RohanBhangui nice slider - thanx for the link
[07:23:37] <RohanBhangui> np
[07:24:33] <RohanBhangui> dan2k3k4: pick one: http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2013/06/jquery-slider.html
[07:28:51] <RohanBhangui> dan2k3k4: creat from scratch
[07:29:31] <dan2k3k4> RohanBhangui: well turns out we had bxSlider already for this project :s so I guess I'll just use that
[07:29:42] <dan2k3k4> but thanks anyway, Slides looks better
[07:29:53] <RohanBhangui> np
[07:37:23] <drager> I have a var that contains a value and I want to increase that value by one. How should I do it? I tried, parseInt(var) + 1
[07:39:46] <tamarche> How are you declaring the variable?
[07:40:36] <drager> var score = +db.getItem('score') || 0;
[07:42:28] <tamarche> if score is an integer, you should be able to do simple + 1
[07:42:44] <tamarche> but if you get a string concat, then you will need to parse
[07:42:58] <superdoo> hi, what should be the problem if I get back as ajax response the full webpage html code?
[07:43:30] <tamarche> superdoo: what are you expecting the response to be?
[07:43:39] <superdoo> json
[07:43:41] <superdoo> data
[07:43:47] <drager> tamarche: Solved it, I tried doing; $('.ui-title').html('Level ' + parseInt(id)+1); but that didnt work so I did; var my_int = parseInt(id) +1; $('.ui-title').html('Level ' + my_int);
[07:43:51] <drager> and that worked
[07:43:56] <tamarche> superdoo: somewhere in the server side code, you'll need to specify the response type
[07:44:12] <tamarche> drager: excellent
[07:44:47] <superdoo> tamarche: the php data echo-ed out with json_encode() , working on other script parts..
[07:44:52] <drager> superdoo: On the server-side you should set the mimetype to application/javascript
[07:45:18] <superdoo> drager: yes I do it
[07:46:51] <tamarche> superdoo: Do you get any server errors?
[07:46:53] <drager> When I'm using ajax to get things I just return a httpresonse with a simplejson dump of my vars and the mimetype set to js
[07:47:05] <superdoo> tamarche: no
[07:48:29] <tamarche> superdoo: i assume you are using $.ajax, after the ajax completes does it go into success or error function
[07:50:05] <superdoo> tamarche: doesnt reach even success, and nor error
[07:51:06] <tamarche> superdoo: then how are you getting back a response?
[07:51:49] <superdoo> chrome dev tools
[07:52:46] <NoiseEee> superdoo: so it sounds like your backend page is encoding a response incorrectly?  or you're hitting a regular php page that doesn't produce anything for an xhr call?
[07:53:15] <superdoo> the ajax called php page give 302 back (codeigniter)
[07:53:47] <superdoo> and in the next line in network tab is the main url, with the whole page code..
[07:54:15] <superdoo> i have a 98% same ajax-php structure next to this, and that works
[07:54:32] <NoiseEee> superdoo: are you hitting a page that a) is the right one  and b) returns JSON?
[07:54:40] <NoiseEee> superdoo: because it sounds not
[07:56:28] <superdoo> for the ajax call , response, preview tabs are empty
[08:01:41] <NoiseEee> superdoo: then what response are you even talking about?
[08:20:59] <Gigs-> Hi, I'm trying to set an on focus event globally in order to debug a problem I'm having with the scroll jumping around...  nothing's happening http://paste.ubuntu.com/5887870/
[08:21:39] <Gigs-> if I change it to do .on focusin, then I get a lot of alerts (too many), but it's like focus never happens
[08:24:55] <Gigs-> alternately, if anyone knows why the scroll keeps jumping around with jquery-ui dialog on the first click (but not subsequent), that's be nice heh.  I think it has something to do with an off-screen element gaining focus, which is why I'm trying to debug what's getting focused.
[08:30:27] <fesener_> would someone tell me why i put my code to jsfiddle it works: http://jsfiddle.net/NEPsc/35/ but it doesnt work on my page
[08:30:40] <fesener_> i've implemented all libraries too but still doesnt work

[08:34:36] <fesener_> boytoy, i have a single text input
[08:34:48] <fesener_> when a user presses enter on that text input, i'll validate
[08:35:00] <boytoy> ah ok
[08:35:02] <fesener_> and emit to my server if validated
[08:35:13] <fesener_> i've found the problem though, i dont know how to solve
[08:35:14] <fesener_>                 e.stopPropagation();
[08:35:15] <fesener_>                 e.stopped = true;
[08:35:15] <fesener_>                 e.preventDefault();
[08:35:21] <fesener_> these 3 lines were creating the problem
[08:35:43] <fesener_> i removed them now but after user presses enter, that "this field required" text pops again

[08:48:46] <noregret> if i want to check if an element exists, should i check .length ?
[08:50:42] <tamarche> if length is 0
[08:50:46] <tamarche> it does not exist
[08:50:49] <tamarche> that is how I usually do it
[08:53:56] <eSoul> Hey guys, I had a quick question, Im using jquery 1.4.1 for an assignment, and I need to use tabs and menus.  Do I need the jquery-ui js for that as well as the jquery js, and if so, what version of the jquery-ui should I be looking for to supprt 1.4.1
[08:57:17] <Al1> need some help modifying this script - http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/04/17/slide-and-push-menus/ - using this menu in our app and would like to show menu only on first load and then hide it…can someone help?
[08:58:46] <jsatk> eSoul: I would say you definitely do not need jQuery-ui as a requirement to do tabs and menus.
[08:59:12] <jsatk> eSoul: however it is totally do-able with and might make it a bit nicer and quicker to make.
[08:59:26] <jsatk> eSoul: as far as which version of jQuery you need for jQuery-ui I've honestly no idea.
[08:59:35] <jsatk> for jquery 1.4.1 that is.
[09:02:31] <eSoul> jsatk:  Thanks. I appreciate the input.  I am in the first ever run of a class my university made for ASP.Net and the last assignment is using jQuery and AJAX for a few things, but none of us have gotten any lecture over how to actually use the two.  Not to say I dont like that.  I like being able to figure everything out on my own.  It's just im not sure exactly how he wants it done either
[09:04:35] <jsatk> I would encourage you to look at jQuery's ajax method as well as it's short-hand methods .get and .post
[09:04:53] <jsatk> eSoul: oops. Sorry. meant to tag your name on the last message.
[09:06:11] <eSoul> jsatk: No worries.  I appreciate it
[09:09:11] <perara_> Hello, anyone know why my javascript aint running if i start on destination page, click the home button (ajax) and goes back to another destination (ajax)
[09:09:14] <MaxSan1> eSoul lok at $.ajax first though as it has full configuration settings for it
[09:09:27] <MaxSan1> .get and .post are just short version for ajax essentially
[09:10:46] <eSoul> Thanks MaxSan.
[09:11:25] <eSoul> I guess my next question is how do I include AJAX into my asp.net page as well...is there a js or something similar I need to download/include in my project
[09:12:25] <tamarche> eSoul: You would call ajax in a script
[09:12:55] <tamarche> Normally, you specify what page it goes to with parameters and options, and do something with the data you get back
[09:13:24] <eSoul> I see i see
[09:14:17] <jop008> How can you influcnce the widht of table colums (JQM)
[09:14:38] <Al1> how can i execute jquery code only once on page load and then not to do it again?
[09:14:55] <tamarche> All, call it in document.ready()
[09:15:14] <gho5t> why would it be called more than once
[09:16:02] <jop008> I use this chtml += "<td><div data-role='fieldcontain' style='text-align:left'>";
[09:16:03] <jop008>     chtml += "<input id=\"" + cid + "\" data-mini=\"true\" type=\"number\"  min=\"1\" data-mini=\"true\"  name=" + cid + " value="+ field.rank + ">";
[09:16:04] <jop008>     chtml += "</div>";    >/td>
[09:16:17] <jop008> and in my header I have the size
[09:16:32] <jop008> like this <th style='text-align:center;width:1em;'  data-priority="persist">Volgorde</th>
[09:16:50] <NoiseEee> jop008: don't paste code in here
[09:16:56] <tamarche> use pastebin
[09:17:07] <tamarche> or something similar
[09:17:21] <NoiseEee> jop008: why are you using inline styles at all?
[09:17:56] <veQue> http://i.imgur.com/omQq7sx.jpg
[09:18:01] <jop008> why not
[09:18:14] <gho5t> yikes
[09:18:21] <tamarche> jop008: Because of many reasons
[09:18:38] <tamarche> it's cleaner and more polite, to summarize
[09:18:43] <jop008> but i am loooking for dynamic columns
[09:18:49] <eSoul> lol, veQue
[09:18:55] <jop008> dynamic column width
[09:19:12] <NoiseEee> jop008: well setting anything inline is the opposite architecture for something you want to be dynamic?
[09:21:20] <jop008> I want to have fixed column widths
[09:21:27] <greengriminal> Apparently navobile doesn't work at all on android 2.3 I have tried looking on Stackoverflow and found overflow.com/questions/8013204/android-browser-bug-div-overflow-scrolling is there any other possible workaround?
[09:22:55] <defk0n> Does anyone know how to delete the whole document in jquery ?
[09:22:59] <defk0n> including <html>
[09:23:08] <defk0n> and rewrite it
[09:23:26] <danheberden> defk0n in an iframe?
[09:23:33] <defk0n> no just the whole document
[09:23:50] <tamarche> $('html').remove()
[09:23:54] <defk0n> document.documentElement.innerHTML = ""; this deletes almost everyhting
[09:24:06] <Al1> i want to execute jquery only once when user logs in first time, and then not anymore when they visit other pages
[09:25:46] <gho5t> Al1: that's kind of ambiguous
[09:26:08] <tamarche> All, perhaps you want to save a boolean value in session and test to see if user logged in and boolean value is true/false
[09:26:35] <gho5t> oic
[09:26:41] <gho5t> yeah set a cookie or something
[09:26:41] <perara_> Do anyone know why my javascript is not running when Starting on this page: http://test.persoft.no/uia/Subject/4 --> click Home --> Click on a new entry
[09:26:48] <Al1> @gho5t i.e. show menu open on page load and then user can close it and etc
[09:27:16] <Al1> trying to figure out how to mod this http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/04/17/slide-and-push-menus/
[09:27:21] <tamarche> perara: use developer tool
[09:27:36] <perara_> tamarache: what do you mean?
[09:27:38] <Al1> to be open first page load and then close on sub-sequent ones
[09:28:10] <tamarche> Plus I don't see new entry, cause I  don't speak that language
[09:28:41] <gho5t> Al1: set a cookie after launching it
[09:29:03] <gho5t> actually if you only want it per session then set it on window
[09:29:20] <gho5t> check bit value before launching window next time user hits page
[09:29:33] <NoiseEee> Al1: and the problem you're trying to solve is?
[09:30:27] <perara_> tamarche: my problem is that the javascript wont run, so entries arent showing up when goig back on another entry. so the problem is that javascript dont run on ajax calls. dont know why though
[09:31:28] <tamarche> perara, your url is wrong in ajax call
[09:31:46] <FortuneDays_> Hrm, what's the best way to set up a mouseup?
[09:31:48] <perara_> ill check that then :) thanks
[09:31:50] <tamarche> In the console
[09:31:57] <FortuneDays_> $(this).mouseup only tracks if you mouseup while over the element
[09:31:58] <Al1> @NoiseEee - using that plugin from Codrops for the menu, and I want to do this: when user logs into app - to show that menu expanded, then user can close or keep it open, and whenever user goes to other pages in the app - remember the "setting"
[09:32:04] <jop008> looking here http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0-rc.1/docs/tables/index.html I can't find documentation on column widht
[09:32:06] <FortuneDays_> but I need it to trigger if you move away from the element, too
[09:32:20] <gho5t> FortuneDays_: mouseleave
[09:32:59] <NoiseEee> Al1: so yes, a cookie of sorts, and then return the view state according the cookie / lack-of-cookie
[09:34:58] <Al1> @NoiseEee don't have a lot of experience with jquery and cookies - google to the rescue - thanks of the pointer
[09:40:04] <boytoy> Trying to split this list into two columns (without actually placing it in two columns) http://jsbin.com/edisoz/1/edit -- is there an easier way to do this though?
[09:40:41] <gho5t> yeah just use css
[09:40:57] <jop008> how to use .my-custom-class at http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0-rc.1/docs/tables/table-column-toggle.html
[09:42:16] <gho5t> boytoy: http://jsbin.com/edisoz/2/
[09:42:28] <gho5t> http://jsbin.com/edisoz/2/edit
[09:43:49] <gho5t> if that doesn't suit your needs for some reason, you can also use nth-child(odd) or nth-child(even)
[09:44:12] <gho5t> in ie9+
[09:44:53] <jop008> Can some one help me with setting column wiidths
[09:45:15] <mobile8> Anyone in here with some canvas skills?
[09:46:15] <mobile8> Consider this link, http://goo.gl/pdBvw - hover over the region in the left top of this imagemap (area/region called niquia)
[09:46:36] <Guest____> anyone have experience with face books api?
[09:46:42] <mobile8> I've set the <img> opacity now on 0.2 - when its on 1.0 you cannot see the hover canvas part
[09:46:56] <Guest____> just 1 will do it mobile8
[09:47:12] <mobile8> Guest____: what do you mean?
[09:47:17] <mobile8> Then the hover areas are not visible
[09:47:38] <Guest____> idk
[09:51:23] <drager> I have no idea why I'm getting this; Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on popup prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'open' trying to do; $('.incorrect').popup('open');
[09:51:57] <drager> And I have tried intialize it like this before as well $('.incorrect').popup();
[10:03:07] <traets> you need to initialize popup
[10:05:15] <drager> traets: TypeError: s is undefined
[10:09:59] <drager> Nevermind, solved it
[10:13:30] <defk0n> how does one eventhandle, forms or pressing of enter key regarding ajax requests
[10:13:42] <defk0n> ineed to know what is post and what is get
[10:14:09] <defk0n> should i put a eventhandle on <input type="submit"/> to know if its post?
[10:16:26] <gho5t> wouldn't that pertain to the form not the input
[10:16:44] <gho5t> document.forms[0].getAttribute('method') ?
[10:17:16] <gho5t> srry $('#myForm').attr('method');
[10:17:54] <Otineb> Does anyone know of a way to target html comments? (working with a template system that uses them to populate data.)
[10:18:57] <defk0n> hmm yea your right
[10:19:14] <defk0n> posts can only be made from method attr in html right?
[10:19:25] <defk0n> imean unless you count manipulating headers
[10:19:49] <defk0n> and links are always get?
[10:31:03] <Brutick> Hey all, I was wondering what the best way is to get all "empty" text boxes on a form. Is it possible to do this with one selector, or should I just get all text boxes and check the value manually?
[10:31:26] <gho5t> yep
[10:31:27] <gho5t> :empty
[10:32:06] <gho5t> nevermind I just made that up apparently
[10:32:14] <Brutick> gho5t, Do you think you can demonstrate? http://jsfiddle.net/Mq5kc/2/
[10:32:24] <gho5t> use filter
[10:32:49] <Brutick> gho5t: Oh okay lemme try it out
[10:33:40] <gho5t> $('input').filter(function(){ return $(this).val().length > 0);
[10:33:55] <gho5t> $('input').filter(function(){ return $(this).val().trim()length > 0);
[10:34:01] <gho5t> $('input').filter(function(){ return $(this).val().trim().length > 0);
[10:46:41] <BillCriswell> gho5t: Should probbly do $.trim( $(this).val() ).length
[10:47:22] <BillCriswell> 'whatever'.trim() is a newer featured in JS, bad IE support
[10:47:43] <gho5t> oh right
[10:55:44] <saba> What's the cleanest way to detect if an object is an event object from jQuery and not some random object from somewhere else?
[10:59:45] <saba> I think $.isPlainObject() will work for my specific needs.
[11:01:08] <Brutick> BillCriswell: Thanks for the heads up, IE is what I have to support primarily!
[11:03:13] <BillCriswell> Brutick: ='(
[11:04:42] <bakers> What is the correct way to set a checkbox to "checked"?
[11:05:34] <NoiseEee> $(el).prop('checked',true)
[11:06:42] <Brutick> BillCriswell: Yeah... internal company-wide webapps... ugh.
[11:06:56] <BillCriswell> How far back do you have to go?
[11:07:21] <Brutick> BillCriswell: Thankfully, only back to IE8. Phew. :P
[11:07:35] <BillCriswell> Yeah, got lucky there.
[11:08:14] <Brutick> I attempt to support older browsers, but if stuff looks ugly I tend to ignore it, because I have better things to do. Haha
[11:16:16] <BillCriswell> Brutick: Yeah, as long as it doesn't look like absolute trash in IE7 I'm usually cool with it. We technically don't support that browser but if it's just a little bit or work I'll deal with it.

[11:22:42] <merin2020> hi, I'm trying to change the background size attribute of a div that has a style
[11:22:44] <merin2020> $('.videoContainer').css('background-size', '120px 80px;');
[11:22:51] <xylogicz> login.mediaencounter.com is my loginpage
[11:22:52] <merin2020> does not set the background-size to that value, why?
[11:28:28] <BillCriswell> merin2020: What if you remove the ; after 80px?
[11:28:49] <merin2020> BillCriswell: Thanks that worked
[11:29:13] <BillCriswell> merin2020: Sweeeeet.
[11:29:49] <xylogicz> no one can help me
[11:29:50] <xylogicz> so gay
[11:37:27] <mobile8> NoiseEee: you're here?
[11:43:29] <KelVarnsen> whats a good way to check if a selector found any elements?
[11:44:07] <dcherman2> KelVarnsen: check the .length property
[11:45:10] <KelVarnsen> oh cool
[11:45:14] <KelVarnsen> it wont be null?
[11:49:34] <Aliks> Hello.  I'm having an issue with jQuery.parseXML... I'm doing some unit testing, and when I return some XML from my mock object, jQuery throws errors like, "cannot parse circular XML" etc.
[11:49:41] <Aliks> But the same XML when it's returned from the real server doesn't throw any errors
[11:49:45] <Aliks> any ideas what would cause that?
[11:50:12] <Aliks> for example: "Error: Invalid XML: ]]>" <--- caused by a CDATA... but it's handled fine from the real server
[11:56:49] <companyhen_> I installed isotope on a site I'm building yesterday, it was working fine up until an hour ago and now the transition animations have stopped when you click the filters. Can anyone help me out? http://teenagemutantninjaturtles.com/beta/
[11:59:26] <boytoy> companyhen_: have you checked out packery yet?
[12:00:29] <companyhen_> no
[12:00:35] <companyhen_> this was my first time implementing isotope
[12:00:47] <companyhen_> i have not heard of packery before!
[12:01:58] <boytoy> companyhen_: it's the isotope author's latest stuff, pretty cool
[12:02:17] <companyhen_> yeah it looks neat. any way to help me with my current isotope issue? i'm not sure why the animations would stop..
[12:02:21] <companyhen_> the filtering is still working fine
[12:09:07] <boytoy> companyhen_: best reduce stuff into a http://jsbin.com/ for easy edit
[12:10:35] <companyhen_> to share with you guys?
[12:11:33] <mikehenriquez> hello guys, i have a issue that is killing me, i dynamically create a div with a close button, I'm using "$('.windowJugadorClose').on('click', function(){" to close that window but the click is not working, any idea?
[12:12:06] <companyhen_> boytoy: http://jsbin.com/uyaxif/1/
[12:12:18] <companyhen_> oops, i mean this
[12:12:19] <companyhen_> http://jsbin.com/uyaxif/1/edit
[12:13:26] <neataroni> im getting a weird Status: parsererror when making a PATCH request with jQuery to tastypie. I can see it modifies the data in the db, but the $.ajax request thinks its getting an error back, so the error handler fires. Any guesses why this is happening?
[12:13:30] <boytoy> companyhen_: it wont work with php afaik
[12:13:38] <companyhen_> right.. i have the live site up though
[12:13:51] <boytoy> best isolate the problem itself
[12:14:10] <boytoy> then put it up on jsbin, its kinda hard to have to wabble in all the external stuff
[12:14:34] <companyhen_> i'm getting "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 (Unauthorized) https://api.tldr.io/users/you"
[12:15:59] <xylogicz> I am trying to code a remote login for login.mediaencounter.com to go to platform.mediaencounter.com and have trouble doing it. I put the hiddens in the bottom but it still didnt wrk
[12:18:18] <fesener_> is this statement "$('#player-'+data.username).remove();" removes ALL #player-data.username or just the first one it encounters?
[12:18:35] <gho5t> all
[12:18:47] <fesener_> so wierd
[12:18:50] <gho5t> but hopefully there's only one since you're using an id
[12:18:59] <fesener_> i have this
[12:19:00] <fesener_>                 $('#player-'+data.username).remove();
[12:19:00] <fesener_>                 console.log($('#player-'+data.username).html());
[12:19:09] <fesener_> but it does print
[12:19:21] <fesener_> it should print anything right?
[12:19:25] <fesener_> shouldnt*
[12:20:58] <gho5t> it shouldn't right
[12:21:09] <gho5t> are you caching the object in a variable?
[12:21:43] <fesener_> no
[12:21:45] <gho5t> e.g. var $foo = $('#foo'); $foo.remove(); console.log($foo.html()); ?
[12:21:47] <fesener_> just appending and removing
[12:21:59] <gho5t> hm
[12:22:07] <fesener_> i've changed all player-"+value+" from ID to class now
[12:22:12] <fesener_> after you said that
[12:22:15] <fesener_> i'll test it now
[12:22:25] <gho5t> cool yeah that might be it
[12:23:27] <fesener_> wow i guess that fixed it
[12:24:05] <gho5t> if you had more than one instance it makes sense
[12:24:28] <gho5t> jquery probably uses document.getElementById if you have an id selector
[12:25:35] <jkevinburton> Can someone help me a selector query?  Its a "not" but more complex... $('.selector1, .selector2, .selector3) not have lang attribute of 'en" (the selectors are dynamic
[12:25:37] <gho5t> http://jsperf.com/getelementbyid-vs-queryselector
[12:26:27] <gho5t> $('.selector1, .selector2, .selector3).not('[lang=en]') ?
[12:26:40] <fesener_> gho5t, i thought player-"+value+" is unique
[12:26:46] <fesener_> so i was using id BUT
[12:26:54] <fesener_> i have that drag&drop thing
[12:26:58] <jkevinburton> gho5t: i thought I would before I tried that.
[12:27:02] <fesener_> i didnt know it was cloning the whole thing
[12:27:12] <fesener_> so when i drag something, theres now 2 divs with same id
[12:27:15] <fesener_> so it wasnt deleting
[12:27:17] <jkevinburton> gho5t: I would ask*
[12:27:23] <the-erm> Someone I'm working with did something like this $("<option></option>", {id:1, value:"foo"}).text("bar");
[12:27:24] <the-erm> What would i need to google, - if you have a link that'd be great - to research the {id:1, value:foo} arg. (I know what it's doing, I just want to research what else I might be missing.)
[12:30:30] <the-erm> I've never seen any example code of passing an object as the 2nd arg.  It's just kinda weird.
[12:31:18] <the-erm> the-erm: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery-html-attributes try that.
[12:31:22] <the-erm> Thanks.
[12:33:50] <gho5t> yeah haven't seen that before myself
[12:37:43] <Bloomberg> Hi guys!!
[12:37:44] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/T5p3r/
[12:38:12] <Bloomberg> How can I send that array object to post with jquery?
[12:38:28] <Bloomberg> this :: {'data':tabs1}?
[12:39:27] <tamarche> Did you try serializing it/
[13:00:18] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: What is src?
[13:02:19] <BillCriswell> And why are you setting display:block in there?
[13:02:29] <BillCriswell> And... just so many other questions.
[13:08:51] <davidw> hi - what's the best way to match on a given css attribute?
[13:09:04] <davidw> i.e. all elements that match text-transform: uppercase
[13:12:15] <darkpassenger> Hi all
[13:13:09] <darkpassenger> is there a way to get a list of text contained in a div with li inside along with the next input of that li ?
[13:13:30] <TorpedoSkyline> BillCriswell that jsfiddle is going to give me nightmares for weeks
[13:14:44] <darkpassenger> i thought about $("#id").find("li").each(function(e){ anArray.push(e:$(this).next("input").val() or text());});
[13:15:00] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell:: var src = $('#forms-mision-content input[class="field-form-proy"]');
[13:15:05] <darkpassenger> let me pastebin that
[13:15:19] <BillCriswell> davidw: You can do like... $('*').filter(function(){ return this.style.textTransform === 'uppercase' }); maybe?
[13:15:48] <davidw> BillCriswell, yeah, I guess that's as good as it gets
[13:18:15] <BillCriswell> davidw: I'm not sure this.style.textTransform is right.. not having any luck with it?
[13:18:35] <davidw> BillCriswell, well... the main idea was to see if I could avoid scanning all elements
[13:19:58] <BillCriswell> davidw: http://jsbin.com/udecus/1/edit my quick test.
[13:20:04] <BillCriswell> davidw: YEah, thnk it's the only option.
[13:20:34] <darkpassenger> http://pastebin.com/8u4i6YVH
[13:21:01] <darkpassenger> hwo to get the li.textContext() of all li and input textContent of all input's in order ? <
[13:22:14] <BillCriswell> davidw: var textInOrder = $('#fiche_modif  li').map(function(){ return $(this).text(); }).get().sort();
[13:26:59] <BillCriswell> darkpassenger: I meant to say ^
[13:27:56] <darkpassenger> it works well to get the li text
[13:28:01] <darkpassenger> thank you
[13:28:14] <darkpassenger> but i cant do the same for input value can i
[13:28:59] <BillCriswell> darkpassenger: I'm a dumbass.
[13:29:28] <BillCriswell> darkpassenger: Change $('#fiche_modif li') to $('#fiche_modif li')
[13:29:33] <BillCriswell> to $('#fiche_modif input') *
[13:29:45] <BillCriswell> then do .val() instead of .text() inside of map
[13:30:02] <BillCriswell> $('#fiche_modif input').map(function(){ return $(this).val(); }).get().sort();
[13:30:22] <BillCriswell> Not sure what you're trying to do here... but you may want to look into .serializeArray()
[13:30:28] <aFeijo> hi folks, I'm sending an php array to my js script using json_encode(), the problem is that it get as an object in JS. How can I change it to js array?
[13:30:53] <BillCriswell> davidw: document.getElementsByTagName('*') is pretty damn fast haha
[13:31:36] <BillCriswell> document.getElementsByTagName('*'); -> *: 0.215ms versus $('*') -> $: 2.948ms
[13:33:55] <shoky> aFeijo: are you sure it's a real array and not an associative array in php? i recall that they're both called arrays in php. if not.. how are you getting it in js, and show what the json looks like (the actual php response text)
[13:34:13] <aFeijo> shoky, it is an associative array
[13:34:27] <shoky> aFeijo: associative array = js object
[13:34:35] <aFeijo> shoky, $array['group']['val'] = 1;
[13:34:43] <aFeijo> the group has many values
[13:34:52] <shoky> then it's an object
[13:35:05] <shoky> in js terms
[13:35:12] <aFeijo> shoky, ok, I have an js object then, that need to be converted into js array. I need that data for the highcharts script
[13:35:22] <shoky> you can use $.map
[13:35:38] <shoky> ?$.map
[13:35:40] <bot-t1> shoky, .map() | jQuery API Documentation - Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[13:35:52] * aFeijo will try
[13:36:52] <darkpassenger> can the function on() work on any dynamic element binded to a handler (using on) ?
[13:37:26] <shoky> darkpassenger: what do you mean
[13:37:44] <aFeijo> shoky, Ok I have my .map function set, now I need to create an array and feed it. .push wont work, it has no associative capacity has it?
[13:37:55] <shoky> aFeijo: $.map returns a new array
[13:37:57] <darkpassenger> I think i cant get the value of the "input" element because its dynamically loaded ,
[13:38:01] <aFeijo> oh
[13:38:02] <darkpassenger> shoky:
[13:38:26] <darkpassenger> so I was wondering could I use on( ) to make sure to get the dynamically loaded value ?
[13:38:37] <darkpassenger> and how would i go for that ... if possible :S
[13:39:39] <shoky> darkpassenger:  i guess you might mean something like.. $('#staticContainer').on('change', 'input', function() { ... })
[13:39:51] <shoky> read about event delegation, see ?on
[13:39:52] <bot-t1> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:41:43] <wagtag> When making an $.ajax request is it possible to always call the global handlers (success, error, etc) in $.ajaxSetup?
[13:42:42] <shoky> wagtag: you mean in addition to the "local" handlers?
[13:43:07] <wagtag> shoky: right. When a local handler is define it overrides those in ajaxSetup
[13:43:36] <shoky> wagtag: you can do that yes. but, ajaxSetup docs have a note: Global callback functions should be set with their respective global Ajax event handler methods—.ajaxStart(), .ajaxStop(), .ajaxComplete(), .ajaxError(), .ajaxSuccess(), .ajaxSend()—rather than within the options object for $.ajaxSetup().
[13:44:28] <shoky> wagtag: the way to do it with ajaxSetup would be do use .done()/.fail() for the local handlers
[13:44:41] <wagtag> shoky: Good to know. Thanks
[13:49:14] <darkpassenger> http://pastebin.com/nyRSbvKp
[13:50:19] <shoky> darkpassenger:  $('#fiche_modif').on(...)  will return $('#fiche_modif')  not the input
[13:51:02] <shoky> and not the input's text. you use that inside the callback, not outside of it
[13:52:17] <darkpassenger> shoky: like that ? http://pastebin.com/YWWfm1T5
[13:53:17] <shoky> if that's what you wanna get, i guess. that'll get you , on each input change, the texts of all the inputs
[13:53:36] <shoky> but remove the  input_text =     on line 1
[13:54:12] <darkpassenger> well what i really want is that once I click on a button , it check all the input text and put it in an array
[13:54:22] <darkpassenger> but input is dynamically loaded
[13:54:23] <darkpassenger> so it the button
[13:55:07] <shoky> well, then that's how.. but i guess you'd wanna change  the event to 'click'  and the 'input' to  button  or whatever it is
[13:55:10] <darkpassenger> but since i already am in $('body').on("click", "buttonId", function()->
[13:55:17] <shoky> oh
[13:55:31] <shoky> don't set an event handler inside an event handler..
[13:55:37] <darkpassenger> ok
[13:56:10] <orentanay> Just wanted to confirm that my logic was correct. I need to manipulate the layout of a few elements onscreen relative to where they render on the screen and to each other. It's a weird scenario, anyway... Am I correct in using $(function(){}); so that I'm waiting for the DOM to fully load before I manipulate my elements. Where as if I were creating all of the onscreen elements via my methods,
[13:56:11] <orentanay> I could use (function($){})(jQuery);   ? Thanks.
[13:56:45] <darkpassenger> shoky: the code i showed you will do for li element because they are loaded before but the input wont work
[13:57:52] <shoky> darkpassenger: it'd be best to make a simple jsfiddle.  not really following you anymore
[13:58:00] <darkpassenger> okidoo
[13:59:48] <shoky> orentanay: $(function(){})  just waits for the DOM to be ready, meaning the browser finished reading all the initial HTML.  (function($){ })(jQuery)  is totally unrelated and doesn't wait for anything
[14:00:00] <shoky> not really sure what you're asking, other than that
[14:01:40] <shoky> orentanay:  if you're creating elements yourself, you still need to wait for the DOM to be ready, so that you can insert your elements into it
[14:02:09] <shoky> but.. just put your scripts at the end of <body> and then you don't need to worry about it
[14:03:47] <darkpassenger> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/rqeHx/
[14:05:12] <shoky> darkpassenger: you're returning on line 7
[14:05:25] <shoky> instead of line 8
[14:05:41] <shoky> coffeescript looks fun...
[14:05:51] <darkpassenger> lol....
[14:05:57] <darkpassenger> coffeescript is frankenstein
[14:06:05] <shoky> lol
[14:06:08] <systemfault> No… just useless.
[14:06:37] <Aliks> I'm having an issue with $(some XML).... it is complaining "TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON", but I'm not trying to convert it to JSON...
[14:06:38] <darkpassenger> shoky: call me numb i dont see my error
[14:06:46] <gho5t> typescript baby!
[14:06:51] <gho5t> jk never used
[14:06:55] <gho5t> but heard good things actually
[14:06:58] <Aliks> and what's interesting, is this only happens when I'm running a test... it doesnt happen in the real site
[14:07:07] <shoky> darkpassenger:  also.. you want .val() for inputs, not .text()
[14:07:52] <darkpassenger> shoky: what is it with line 7 , again , if dont mind
[14:08:20] <shoky> darkpassenger: you're returning there... it never reaches line 10
[14:08:31] <shoky> darkpassenger: and in line 8 inside the .map  you're not returning anything
[14:08:53] <shoky> move the return from line 7 to line 8
[14:09:00] <shoky> er sorry
[14:09:07] <shoky> 6 to 7
[14:09:59] <darkpassenger> shoky: ah! work! thanks
[14:10:13] <shoky> welcom
[14:11:16] <shoky> Aliks: donno why it's yelling about JSON, but try $.parseXML
[14:11:37] <Aliks> shoky: I wouldn't do $(xmlString) ?
[14:11:56] <shoky> $( $.parseXML(xmlString) )
[14:12:00] <shoky> is better/safer
[14:12:38] <Gigs-> if anyone is interested, I fixed the jquery-ui scrollable dialogs jumping all over the place by giving them an invisible opacity (but "visible") a href at the top which I forced them to focus on after popup was complete.
[14:13:29] <darkpassenger> haha oh man arrays in js are not ordered
[14:13:33] <Gigs-> The browser doesn't like the idea of a scrollable thing that doesn't have anything in it focused, and will eat the first click event and focus on the first focusable element
[14:13:59] <Aliks> shoky: thanks.  interesting.  So what does just $() do?  Does it sometimes detect that it should parseXML?
[14:14:04] <shoky> darkpassenger sure they are
[14:14:08] <Aliks> shoky: I'm curious why some cases work and some cases don't
[14:14:36] <tw2113> aliens
[14:14:41] <darkpassenger> shoky: derp, yes indeed
[14:15:29] <Aliks> shoky: FYI, I'm still getting JSON.stringify() error when doing $.parseXML
[14:15:40] <Aliks> shoky: I have no idea what JSON.stringify() has to do with $.parseXML
[14:15:43] <shoky> Aliks: can you put it in a jsfiddle
[14:17:53] <shoky> Aliks: i think $() should only work for simple xml that looks like html. it's not really meant for xml
[14:18:06] <Aliks> shoky: in jsFiddle it works fine
[14:18:31] <shoky> then you've got something else going on there..
[14:19:16] <Aliks> shoky: yep..
[14:22:11] <Aliks> interesting
[14:22:18] <Aliks> and calling xml.toString() throws a SecurityException
[14:24:38] <Aliks> shoky: interesting, seems to be related to console.log rather than actually doing the parsing
[14:24:46] <Aliks> $( $.parseXML(xml) ) works fine
[14:24:55] <Aliks> but console logging the result in PhantomJS causes an error
[14:27:29] <darkpassenger> yep
[14:27:32] <darkpassenger> java here I come
[14:27:39] <darkpassenger> whenim done with this node.js project
[14:27:40] <darkpassenger> :D
[14:29:21] <aFeijo> I cant figure out why $.map() return a blank array :(
[14:36:09] <darkpassenger> bye all
[14:36:13] <Aliks> figured it out
[14:36:15] <darkpassenger> thanks for your constant hel
[14:36:16] <darkpassenger> p
[14:36:19] <darkpassenger> HELP
[14:36:20] <darkpassenger> :D
[15:10:01] <Tomashe> hey guys , i want to know, there is a quick way to make a look to run every day between 2 dates?
[15:13:08] <Lindrian> can you make your own constraint function for draggable element?
[15:13:09] <Lindrian> in jquery i
[15:13:10] <Lindrian> ui*
[15:31:36] <ech0s7> hi all!
[15:32:30] <ech0s7> i would parse a XML file which is in the same directory of js file
[15:32:44] <ech0s7> for test i'm using this code: http://ideone.com/bG0j6t
[15:32:58] <ech0s7> but stringData is always null
[15:38:54] <darkPassenger> Is it possible to create a dictionnary out of two similarly-sized array ?
[15:41:56] <ech0s7> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:8000/Uccelli.xml. Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[15:42:19] <ech0s7> opening a browser on http://localhost:8000/Uccelli.xml i view the file
[15:44:16] <eddiemonge> ?sop @ ech0s7
[15:44:17] <b-ot> ech0s7: Requests must respect the Same Origin Policy ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy ). Requesting cross-domain content in javascript is generally prohibited. Seeing OPTIONS requests? See https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTTP_access_control
[15:44:17] <bot-t1> ech0s7, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[15:45:12] <ech0s7> thanks!
[15:50:35] <darkPassenger> is there such things as dictionnary in javascript ?
[15:51:16] <systemfault> You can use an object
[15:51:37] <systemfault> But no, there's no real "dictionnary" in JS
[15:51:39] <darkPassenger> yeah , ok
[15:53:37] <mobile8> whats the best way to add fill="transparent" to an <svg> element with jquery?
[16:26:38] <lablackey> Anyone available to help with a totally remedial question?
[16:27:46] <lablackey> I have a page with dynamically loading tabs, I want one of the tabs to be loaded automatically with no user input after ~5 seconds, so basically I would be changing the URL from index.html to index.html#default, is there a simple way to do this?
[16:28:45] <ccmonster> settimeout, then do your function
[16:30:53] <ccmonster> did that help lablackey? where are you stuck?
[16:31:44] <lablackey> The timeout works, I'm basically having trouble getting the tab to load with no user input, using this plugin http://jsfiddle.net/sg3s/RZpbK/
[16:32:36] <lablackey> I am trying to get one of those tabs to load automatically without clicking first. Thanks for your help btw, this is literally my second hour of using jquery so I have a lot to learn
[16:56:11] <neataroni> i would like a list that i can reorder by dragging elements, and add elements to from a dropdown- anything out there that takes care of this nicely?
[16:58:28] <RohanBhangui> neataroni: have you looked into using jquery ui draggables with building something from scratch
[16:58:39] <neataroni> thats my plan if nothing else comes along
[17:05:19] <RohanBhangui> thats what i suggest you do
[17:05:26] <RohanBhangui> id be glad to assist if you need help
[17:16:13] <RohanBhangui> neataroni: you may have to create a dropdown of your own instead of using the default, native html dropdown, because of the nature of your problem
[17:17:03] <neataroni> i dont think so, just catch when someone clicks on an item in the dropdown, and send it over to the draggabble list
[17:20:05] <leo-the-manic> Is there an easy way to get something more detailed than [object Object] for debugging purposes?
[17:20:45] <RohanBhangui> neataroni: i was under the impression that you wanted to drag something from a dropdown and then drag it too a list or something
[17:21:11] <neataroni> ah, not necessesarily, though that would be nice ui, but i dont think it really matters in my quick n dirty case
[17:21:29] <RohanBhangui> lol
[17:30:36] <eN_Joy> can some one take a look at my jQuery jPlayer top of the sidebar? it's not playing but just connecting, I believe it's because that the player uses some method to scramble the url, the method messed up when the url contains special character such as %, _, &, how do i either: tell the js to handle those chars., or even completely disable the scrambler? BTW, the actual path for the mp3 is http://bbs.powerapple.com/forum.php?mod=attachment&aid=ODY0NzY0fGF
[17:30:43] <eN_Joy> and the player is at http://django.blogsite.org/?p=34378
[17:31:45] <eN_Joy> the same mp3 path would play just fine with the jPlayer demo
[17:37:14] <ernston> has anyone used jquery mobile dialog ?
[17:46:51] <peter5839> would any one be able to help me with a little problem I'm having with an infinite for in loop in my jquery get callback?
[17:47:14] <oreth> what's the problme?
[17:48:29] <peter5839> when I try to iterate over a returned json's keys the loop executes but never seems to exit. I've tested this by putting append statements after the loop.
[17:48:57] <peter5839> i've put a minimised ish example here http://pastebin.com/DbLZfGBr
[17:49:46] <Krinkle> peter5839: is it intentional that max is lower than min (max has the -, min does not)
[17:50:02] <Krinkle> (line 3)
[17:50:44] <Krinkle> peter5839: global variable 'myjosnkey'
[17:50:55] <oreth> also: if (!isNaN(myusefullkey))
[17:51:10] <oreth> you test to find out if myusefulkey isn't a number
[17:51:13] <oreth> and then you do math with it
[17:51:15] <oreth> that will never work
[17:51:30] <Krinkle> oreth: !
[17:51:43] <oreth> derp
[17:51:47] <oreth> you are correct
[17:51:52] <oreth> disregard that
[17:52:22] <peter5839> its not actually a global Krinkle I was just slopy and forgot to declare it. could that be the issue?
[17:52:39] <oreth> Krinkle: re: max vs min.
[17:52:45] <Krinkle> though I don't use it much, !isNaN is actually a quite effective/simple way to check that something is a usable number. except that it also allows strings, but then again, so does js math operators (most of the time.. :D )
[17:52:45] <oreth> he's seeding them correctly.
[17:53:12] <oreth> if (num > max) { max = num };
[17:53:13] <Krinkle> peter5839: by declare you mean include in the paste, or like, there is never a var statement for it?
[17:53:21] <Krinkle> because in the code shown it is most certainly a global variable
[17:53:31] <Krinkle> not that that's a problem problem, but it is a probelm.
[17:53:39] <peter5839> there was never a var stament for it
[17:53:57] <oreth> then yeah, you're losing your scope
[17:54:10] <peter5839> let me just try fixing that
[17:54:11] <Krinkle> I'd change "var mytotal=0" to "var myjosnkey, myusefullkey, \n mytotal = 0"
[17:54:25] <Krinkle> myusefullkey is also an implied global
[17:54:34] <oreth> also: that's the problem….
[17:55:08] <oreth> for (myjsonkey in data) { //myjsonkey only exists here }
[17:55:19] <oreth> you're spinning through data, getting a new jsonkey each time
[17:55:26] <Krinkle> no, most certainly not
[17:55:32] <Krinkle> there is no block scope in javascrit
[17:55:45] <oreth> then after the loop is done, you do the conditional
[17:55:51] <Krinkle> myjsonkey is as visible in that code as any variable can be in javascript, it is an implied global variable.
[17:55:56] <peter5839> well I've added var staments for both it hasn't fixed the problem
[17:56:10] <oreth> krinkle, not when it's being used as an iterator
[17:56:31] <Krinkle> there is no such thing as an iterator variable javascript, and no block scope
[17:56:37] <Krinkle> all variables are either global or function scoped
[17:56:52] <Krinkle> peter just changed his code for the variable to be function scoped instead of global.
[17:57:34] <peter5839> indeed neater that way at least
[17:58:06] <ernston> hi, can anyone help me shorten this code: http://jsfiddle.net/Nr9jE/
[17:58:29] <ernston> the code is repetitive and am curious how you would improve this for a real world situation
[17:58:51] <Krinkle> peter5839: so what exactly is the problem? Can you reproduce this somewhere interactive? jsfiddle.net for example, or codepen.io
[17:59:15] <peter5839> I can try. although I'm unfamiliar with both these sites
[17:59:16] <Krinkle> (and e.g. do an if ( ... ) { console.log('good') } else { console.log bad, so we can see what you want to be good/bad, and we can try figure it out :)
[17:59:51] <oreth> Krinkle: i must say that I've been writing javascript for a long time and never realized that "iterators" were globally scoped if used like that
[18:00:38] <Krinkle> oreth: if it has no 'var', it is an implied global. I'm glad I was able to teach you something this day :)
[18:00:50] <groundup> I am trying to validate an email field with a remote validation rule to check if the email already exists. My url is "/user/email@url.com" so I need to have the remote url point to that dynamically. It is sending it via the query string with the field name.
[18:00:52] <oreth> i suppose, that i've been writing _.each / jQuery.each() / Object.forEach for so long.
[18:01:05] <groundup> How can I make the remote url set dynamically?
[18:01:13] <peter5839> I could just link you to the website my code is running on and the js file of intrest?
[18:01:36] <oreth> i wrote this little visualization this afternoon in about an hour: http://threebound.com
[18:01:44] <oreth> it's javascript back to front
[18:01:46] <oreth> (node back end)
[18:01:51] <groundup> I have tried remote: function () { return '{{path('user.exists.noEmail')}}/' + $('#{{form.email.first.vars.id}}').val()} and remote: '{{path('user.exists.noEmail')}}/' + $('#{{form.email.first.vars.id}}').val()
[18:01:56] <Krinkle> I don't know about others, but I'd rather not dig into an entire website. Please abstract the problem as small as you can.
[18:02:15] <Krinkle> In most cases when I do that, I solve my own problem before I finish creating the codepen page.
[18:03:14] <Krinkle> oreth: Nice
[18:03:32] <groundup> oreth, that is cool
[18:03:34] <Krinkle> oreth: Is there supposed to be a shadowed map in the background? I don't know the US map very well personally :P
[18:03:39] <oreth> no
[18:03:47] <oreth> the tweets start outlining the country
[18:03:58] <gho5t> stop being so friggin smart
[18:03:58] <Krinkle> though I can guess that the big red bubble is around Washington/New York
[18:03:59] <groundup> I can tell instantly what all of the cities are
[18:04:10] <oreth> the big red area at the top left is New York City (and new jersey/boston/new england)
[18:04:12] <groundup> That big red bubble is NYC ;)
[18:04:26] <groundup> top right, but yeah
[18:04:29] <oreth> the red area on the left is either LA or San Diego (I think it's SD because of Comic Con)
[18:04:34] <gho5t> yeah DC is quite a few miles below
[18:04:58] <oreth> i'm working on adding names
[18:05:02] <oreth> of cities
[18:05:02] <groundup> There are two there in SoCal. SD is lower. I think that is LA
[18:05:10] <gho5t> oreth: you should submit it to javascript weekly
[18:05:16] <oreth> gho5t: what's that now?
[18:05:34] <gho5t> http://javascriptweekly.com/
[18:05:53] <gho5t> they send an email weekly with a list of cool tutorials, apps, etc. built in JS
[18:05:59] <gho5t> there's an html 5 one too
[18:06:54] <groundup> Where's the source of the data?
[18:07:03] <oreth> groundup: twitter's streaming api
[18:07:15] <groundup> You're pumping all of that through your server?
[18:08:07] <oreth> server connects to the streaming api… then i'm using web sockets to connect to clients and pipe data
[18:08:27] <oreth> i'm only piping location data to clients
[18:08:35] <groundup> I was just thinking it would be better for you to just make the client handle the reading
[18:08:36] <oreth> but yeah, my server is processing everything
[18:09:02] <oreth> groundup: you're absolutely right, it would… but i was just trying to do something fun in under an hour.
[18:09:12] <groundup> Yeah, that is really cool
[18:09:28] <oreth> i need to figure out how to connect to the twitter streaming api from the client side
[18:09:52] <oreth> that way, i can filter based on hashtags and what not
[18:10:11] <groundup> I would use it as a background
[18:10:44] <groundup> So, how can I dynamically set the remote url for jQuery validation?
[18:18:19] <RohanBhangui> does anyone know how to make an image flash constantly
[18:18:30] <RohanBhangui> something subtle and smooth when i say "flash"
[18:18:35] <RohanBhangui> almost like a blinking
[18:20:11] <oreth> RohanBhangui: gimme a second.. i'll have an answer for you
[18:20:16] <peter5839> right I can't use jsfiddle to construct a minimal example because I can't do a cross domain get request.
[18:20:20] <RohanBhangui> kk take your time
[18:22:29] <peter5839> and belive me I tried but its the same origin policy getting in the way. so I can't even get my get to run
[18:22:46] <peter5839> and so i can't test its content code
[18:23:50] <oreth> RohanBhangui: http://jsfiddle.net/KXMYQ/
[18:24:35] <RohanBhangui> oreth: forgot to mention 1 thing it has to go continuous...
[18:29:47] <okamis_> hi, i have a string "aoeu" which I want to be changed on keypress to something else but I dont know how to give aoeu an id http://pastebin.com/H2quExDi
[18:33:28] <oreth> RohanBhangui: i leave that as an excerize for… you i suppose.
[18:34:18] <RohanBhangui> oreth: i need to create an infinite loop right?
[18:34:44] <oreth> you'll get a stack overflow if you try that :3
[18:35:31] <gho5t> RohanBhangui: setTimeout()
[18:35:40] <RohanBhangui> ahhh
[18:35:54] <gho5t> okamis_: wrap it in a span
[18:37:09] <RohanBhangui> gho5t: can you show me exmaple by any chance?
[18:37:43] <gho5t> i didn't really look into what you're doing
[18:37:57] <gho5t> but setTimeout simply will call a function after x miliseconds
[18:38:05] <okamis_> gho5t: thanks works like a charm , btw, just curios, when do I use selector.text() vs selector.val()?
[18:38:14] <gho5t> setTimeout(function(){ alert('foo'); }, 1000);
[18:38:33] <gho5t> you'll need to re-init it each time
[18:38:36] <gho5t> or use setInterval
[18:38:39] <gho5t> which is less reliable
[18:38:51] <gho5t> okamis_: .val() is for input values
[18:39:15] <RohanBhangui> kk gho5t
[18:42:51] <peter5839> ok let me ask a generic question. when you have a for in loop over an object with only a few key value pairs what could cause that loop to not exit?
[18:43:26] <gho5t> as in loop infinitely?
[18:43:36] <gho5t> or loop longer than you thought it wuold
[18:44:21] <peter5839> nope I've tested it seems to get jammed on coming out of the loop after the last key value pair.
[18:45:54] <peter5839> it loops 7 times then no more times but still fails to exit
[18:46:29] <peter5839> oh wait you know what I think I know what the issue is
[18:47:30] <peter5839> fix the problem. it should have looped 8 times but the 8th loop generated a bad selector
[18:57:48] <Pavlov> anyone know of a js calendar-ish thing that basically displays N days and lets you put calendar-like boxes at specific times on them?
[19:20:36] <vedz> hey guys i made a website
[19:20:54] <vedz> now major question how do i get people to be able to find it
[19:21:17] <nexxy> vedz, put it on the internet
[19:21:17] <pixelpimp> door-to-door pitches
[19:21:36] <gho5t> yes
[19:21:41] <gho5t> that is how amazon get its start
[19:21:56] <gho5t> do you have a car or someone that can drive you?
[19:22:28] <vedz> the website
[19:22:32] <pixelpimp> perhaps hotwiring is among your skillset
[19:22:42] <vedz> i did but i was going to do meta keywords
[19:22:57] <vedz> http://kadesign.com.au/
[19:23:09] <pixelpimp> Those'll help, but it's content and traffic that matters most.
[19:23:35] <vedz> but i been reading that i should put too much effort on adding all possiable cominations of words to be found
[19:23:44] <pixelpimp> Post comments on related blogs with links back to you
[19:23:45] <vedz> if i have sydney architects
[19:23:55] <vedz> should i add architects sydney
[19:23:57] <vedz> too
[19:24:00] <pixelpimp> no way
[19:24:03] <gho5t> yeah just google up some SEO best practices
[19:24:22] <gho5t> make some friendly urls, use header tags, stuff like taht
[19:24:31] <gho5t> i believe meta tags matter little these days
[19:24:37] <vedz> content cool
[19:25:05] <gho5t> i still think you should pitch the site to your neighbors first
[19:25:15] <gho5t> and have someone film you
[19:25:48] <vedz> thanks for the advice
[19:25:59] <vedz> ?? but what do you mean pitch the site
[19:26:03] <vedz> film me ??
[19:26:29] <gho5t> nevermind just yanking your chain
[19:27:10] <vedz> lol
[19:27:25] <vedz> i am pround of my site
[19:27:31] <vedz> simple and eligant
[19:28:01] <vedz> ahahaha now just need people to see it
[19:35:52] <13WAATAGK> Hi, i have a kind of dumb question... if im returning a text datatype response for an $.ajax request.. how do i make the ajax request 'fail' (error callback)
[19:35:55] <13WAATAGK> i tried returning..
[19:35:59] <13WAATAGK> 400 BAD REQUEST
[19:36:05] <13WAATAGK> but it doesnt trigger the callback for error
[19:36:33] <waysc> is it triggering the success?
[19:37:54] <waysc> 13WAATAGK,
[19:38:02] <13WAATAGK> no
[19:38:10] <13WAATAGK> it doesnt trigger success or error
[19:38:45] <waysc> are you sure it's actually sending the request/do you get -any- response? check your network tab in your developer tools
[19:39:06] <13WAATAGK>  400 (BAD REQUEST) is what i see for the response
[19:39:11] <13WAATAGK> in chrome dev tools
[19:39:32] <13WAATAGK> hmm
[19:39:34] <hazardous> are you actually sending '400 BAD REQUEST'
[19:39:37] <waysc> and you're returning that intentionally?
[19:39:37] <hazardous> or 'HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request'
[19:39:39] <waysc> ^
[19:40:00] <13WAATAGK> its all in caps
[19:40:06] <hazardous> how are you sending it
[19:40:18] <13WAATAGK>         header('HTTP/1.1 400 BAD REQUEST', true, 400);
[19:40:54] <13WAATAGK> arg
[19:41:02] <13WAATAGK> im sorry.... apparently it is calling error, however..
[19:41:15] <13WAATAGK> its not passing in (data) for the function for some reason
[19:41:19] <13WAATAGK> let me check for stupid human errors
[19:41:45] <13WAATAGK>               , error: function (data) {
[19:41:45] <13WAATAGK>                     loading.hide();
[19:41:46] <13WAATAGK>                     statusText.addClass('error').html(data).slideDown();
[19:41:46] <13WAATAGK>                     submit.removeAttr('disabled');
[19:41:46] <13WAATAGK>                 }
[19:41:53] <13WAATAGK> looks right to me?
[19:42:43] <waysc> first thing i would do is console.log(data); and make sure it's giving you something real
[19:43:26] <13WAATAGK> it returns a massive object
[19:43:37] <13WAATAGK> oh,.. i guess i need responseText?
[19:44:02] <waysc> if it's an object then yeah you need to get the relevant data from it
[19:44:22] <13WAATAGK> hmm.. i somehow i dont recall ever having to do that in all the times ive done this before. i guess it just slipped my mind
[19:44:28] <13WAATAGK> how come it works for success when i dont have that?
[19:45:31] <waysc> not sure, I'd have to see the full code but my guess is that if you're returning an error then you're receiving an error object that can't be coerced to a string easily, vs just some returned data
[19:45:58] <13WAATAGK> i see now.. if its successful data returns my string. if its error, it includes everything into one big object
[19:46:35] <waysc> I believe that's the case; your dataType is plain/text right?
[19:46:40] <13WAATAGK> yes
[19:47:19] <waysc> this might help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1637019/how-to-get-the-jquery-ajax-error-response-text
[19:47:34] <waysc> error: function(xhr, status, error) {
[19:47:34] <waysc>   var err = eval("(" + xhr.responseText + ")");
[19:47:34] <waysc>   alert(err.Message);
[19:47:34] <waysc> }
[19:49:55] <13WAATAGK> thanks!
[19:49:59] <13WAATAGK> btw, wtf is up with my name
[19:50:14] <waysc> no problem, and I have no idea ;p
[19:51:15] <13WAATAGK> ok
[19:51:22] <13WAATAGK> thanks again :)
[21:35:19] <Emy2> I'm using .live('click', function(){//do something}); and it's working perfectly on Chrome, however it's doing diddly squat in Firefox. I've also tried .on('click', function(){//do something});
[21:36:24] <Emy2> actually I dunno if i need to specify, but I'm donig  .live('click', function(event){//do something}); Not sure if that'll change anything
[21:39:46] <[E]sc> i'm using ajax formdata to upload a file dynamically via ajax on a form input box but when i click on the cancel, or re-opening the input box to change to another file, it will upload the number of times the upload was cancelled or changed.  i tried using new formData to reset to false however that doesn't work either;  Any suggestions on how to fix that?
[21:49:59] <Emy2> so it appears that my issue isn't stemming from .live() so much as getting the event information from it. In chrome I can do event.srcElement.id however I can't do that in Firefox without it making an error of some sort. Unfortunately I'm writing a userscript and can't seem to figure out how to get error logs for them
[21:50:02] <Emy2> any ideas?
[22:00:03] <NChief>  
[22:02:45] <scar>  
[22:10:54] <duvnell> if I have a dom node from $('whatever'),   can I further use jquery selector function to select deeper into that node?

[22:43:36] <vedz> man its a big world out there so much information

[23:01:58] <vedz> just one more questions is better to use are many possiable verations of keywords for that
[23:02:06] <vedz> so lets say sydney arhitect
[23:02:19] <vedz> have another one architect sydney
[23:05:02] <_Catalyst> I think that might help not to sure

[23:58:52] <MrPink> Hello, I am using jquery UI and using the Accordion animation. But I am encountering a bug when calling the animation in an iframe. This only occurs in Firefox (not in IE or in Chrome). When you have one pane open and click to open another one, it only closes the first pane, but doesn't open the second. Here is an example http://web248.sv05.net-housting.de/frame/test.html  And here is the code in jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/aUSYZ/
