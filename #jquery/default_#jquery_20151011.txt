[00:02:20] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: tahnks!
[00:02:56] <z1haze> anyone care to help me fix this syntax?
[00:03:05] <duch_kazatel> z1haze just ask.
[00:03:08] <duch_kazatel> if we can help, we will.
[00:03:15] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/2M5YMEY
[00:03:53] <duch_kazatel> uh
[00:03:54] <z1haze> i got lost
[00:04:06] <z1haze> :(
[00:04:09] <z1haze> its bad huh?
[00:04:15] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do?
[00:04:29] <z1haze> exactly whats there, i think, just my syntax is all bad
[00:05:01] <duch_kazatel> why the apply for the iife?
[00:05:14] <z1haze> alert on clicking a link, on confirm submit an ajax request, on success, delete the image
[00:05:20] <duch_kazatel> why not use a more standard IIFE?
[00:05:22] <z1haze> well,dlete the form
[00:05:43] <z1haze> oh the whole strick and apply this thing? thasts just then template format that ive been following, i have no idea what itis
[00:05:51] <z1haze> but all of the functions in this file have that so i figured it should stay that way
[00:06:01] <duch_kazatel> lol that's a really strange way to do that, but ok.
[00:06:16] <z1haze> how would you do it? maybe you could help me redo it better
[00:06:18] <duch_kazatel> and your issue is you're missing a closing );
[00:06:25] <duch_kazatel> on line 32
[00:06:28] <z1haze> like i said i dont even know what that use strict and apply stuff does
[00:06:48] <duch_kazatel> use strict is a directive that changes a few things about the language.
[00:07:07] <duch_kazatel> and the apply thing is a weird way to do an IIFE, but your syntax issue is literally that you're missing a closing paren
[00:11:00] <z1haze> Im working with a template (its an existing project) and it has a theme.js file, and a theme.init.js file
[00:11:14] <z1haze> im working in the init file now, and every single function in this file has that apply after it
[00:11:23] <duch_kazatel> right - it's trying to do an IIFE.
[00:11:27] <duch_kazatel> just a strange way to do it.
[00:11:36] <z1haze> what is that?
[00:11:57] <duch_kazatel> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[00:12:04] <duch_kazatel> basically, a one-time use scope.
[00:12:27] <z1haze> hmm
[00:12:40] <z1haze> well im 90% done with my little image upload/delete
[00:12:47] <z1haze> I am using dropzone.js
[00:13:04] <z1haze> Upload the image, then append the div with the image
[00:13:09] <z1haze> but i just noticed a weird issue
[00:13:42] <z1haze> normally when you click on the images, you get a confirm box to delete them, but immediately after uploading an image (before refreshing the page) it doesnt actually do that... any ideas why?
[00:14:08] <z1haze> something about jquery already loaded everything it was going to apply too, then i added new elements?
[00:14:57] <duch_kazatel> more that your code has already run - adding new .delete-row-image after your code has run means those new elements don't have the event binding.
[00:15:01] <duch_kazatel> use event delegation instead.
[00:15:18] <z1haze> can I get a hand/hint on that?
[00:15:22] <duch_kazatel> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ and http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events explain the idea.
[00:15:24] <z1haze> i've been workon all day on this thing
[00:15:48] <z1haze> dont i already use that?
[00:16:00] <duch_kazatel> huh?  how?
[00:16:06] <z1haze> $('.delete-row-image').click(function (e) {
[00:16:17] <duch_kazatel> that's a direct event binding.
[00:16:23] <duch_kazatel> that's not a delegated listener.
[00:16:30] <duch_kazatel> (you didn't read either link ;) )
[00:16:45] <z1haze> am on the second one, yea
[00:17:02] <z1haze> so its just a matter of .on ?
[00:17:03] <duch_kazatel> you don't want .click(function() {}) or .on('click', function() {});
[00:17:12] <duch_kazatel> you still haven't read either link.
[00:17:59] <duch_kazatel> you want .on(), but there's some secret sauce to it ;)
[00:18:05] <z1haze> i am reading
[00:18:20] <z1haze> i see that it says the elements must exist at tht time my code makes the call to .on()
[00:18:30] <duch_kazatel> right, but there's a way around that.
[00:18:32] <z1haze> which technically.. it does exist because i dont click it until its created, right?
[00:18:53] <duch_kazatel> "An event-delegation approach attaches an event handler to only one element, the tbody, and the event only needs to bubble up one level (from the clicked tr to tbody):"
[00:19:05] <duch_kazatel> you need to read the whole thing - it shows you exactly the idea you need to follow.
[00:21:31] <z1haze> fk, yea i thought i had it
[00:21:37] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[00:21:49] <duch_kazatel> i didn't send the links just because.
[00:21:59] <z1haze> no i mean i read it
[00:22:01] <z1haze> and tried
[00:22:01] <duch_kazatel> they cover a really powerful topic that will change the way you work with events.
[00:22:09] <duch_kazatel> show me the code.
[00:23:45] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/2WB963X
[00:24:02] <duch_kazatel> yeah, you didn't read it.
[00:24:06] <duch_kazatel> see that second code example?
[00:24:29] <z1haze> which one this page is super long
[00:24:35] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[00:24:41] <duch_kazatel> there are two code examples under that heading.
[00:24:54] <z1haze> yea, well i saw 3
[00:25:15] <z1haze> ill try to fix, 1 moment
[00:25:33] <z1haze> actually, i dont know how
[00:25:35] <z1haze> :(
[00:25:40] <duch_kazatel> lol
[00:25:42] <duch_kazatel> dude
[00:25:56] <z1haze> man its 1230, i think ive been on my computer for like 12 hours now
[00:26:04] <z1haze> pardon me for not being able to fully focus
[00:26:34] <duch_kazatel> i gave you the answer - i even gave you the line to search earlier.  the code example starts with $( "#dataTable tbody" ).on( "click", "tr", function() {
[00:26:35] <duch_kazatel> like.
[00:26:45] <duch_kazatel> don;t say you read it when you didn;t.
[00:26:45] <z1haze> thats what i was going to do
[00:26:57] <z1haze> but when i saw i had almost that exact same thing when we started
[00:27:14] <duch_kazatel> $(parentThatExistsOnPageload).on('event', 'theThingYouAreDynamicallyAdding', function() {});
[00:28:37] <z1haze> i did that ..
[00:28:51] <duch_kazatel> show me.
[00:28:52] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[00:28:54] <z1haze> k
[00:29:22] <z1haze> actually, i didnt
[00:29:28] <duch_kazatel> lol]
[00:29:31] <duch_kazatel> exactly ;)
[00:29:38] <z1haze> i didnt have that last argument
[00:29:41] <duch_kazatel> right.
[00:29:51] <duch_kazatel> all of that reading material explains that second argument
[00:29:56] <z1haze> i have $('.delete-row-image').on( "click", function() {
[00:30:04] <z1haze> does anything of what i have change?
[00:30:08] <z1haze> do i just add to it
[00:30:12] <duch_kazatel> us.
[00:30:13] <duch_kazatel> *uh
[00:30:15] <duch_kazatel> yes, it changes.
[00:30:20] <duch_kazatel>  $(parentThatExistsOnPageload).on('event', 'theThingYouAreDynamicallyAdding', function() {});
[00:30:28] <z1haze> yea see i dont know what you mean by parentthat exists
[00:30:49] <z1haze> if there are no images, there wont be anything
[00:30:51] <duch_kazatel> a parent element to the one you're adding that exists when the page loads.
[00:31:12] <duch_kazatel> what element are these getting added to?
[00:31:58] <z1haze> #project-images
[00:32:18] <duch_kazatel> and that isn't dynamically added after the page loads, right?
[00:32:21] <duch_kazatel> that just exists?
[00:32:33] <z1haze> yea, its the container
[00:32:45] <duch_kazatel> then that's your parent element.
[00:32:48] <z1haze> but see, let me stop you for a second
[00:33:00] <z1haze> this fucntion we are working on, the end result is going to DELETE stuff
[00:33:06] <z1haze> does that matter
[00:33:09] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[00:33:16] <duch_kazatel> the event binding is the only part that matters.
[00:33:23] <z1haze> so, the thing we are adding dynamically then
[00:33:38] <z1haze> is that what my other function adds?
[00:33:38] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[00:33:45] <z1haze> like the code to add the new images
[00:33:52] <z1haze> because its a big ass chunk of markup
[00:34:04] <duch_kazatel> you said the delete thing doesn't work for those new images, right?
[00:34:10] <z1haze> correct
[00:34:12] <duch_kazatel> right.
[00:34:16] <duch_kazatel> that's what delegation fixes.
[00:34:30] <z1haze> but the new content is dynamic
[00:34:32] <duch_kazatel> events bubble up, so you attach to a parent element instead and capture them as they bubble up.
[00:34:40] <z1haze> certain things like urls etc will change
[00:34:44] <duch_kazatel> again
[00:34:47] <duch_kazatel> it does not matter.
[00:34:52] <duch_kazatel> you just need to change your event binding,
[00:34:56] <z1haze> i dont know what to put for the "thethinkgthatyouareaddingdynamically"
[00:35:16] <duch_kazatel> you're currently targeting .delete-row-image, right?
[00:35:36] <z1haze> yes
[00:35:43] <z1haze> its actually a whole form
[00:35:44] <duch_kazatel> so that's the second arg.
[00:35:53] <z1haze> oh
[00:35:59] <duch_kazatel> but you want to react to click events on .delete-row-image
[00:37:11] <z1haze> $('#project-images').on( "click", ".delete-row-image", function() {
[00:37:20] <duch_kazatel> give it a shot.
[00:37:21] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[00:38:05] <z1haze> cool man thank you, i must end it ona good note and get some sleep
[00:38:08] <z1haze> thanks again
[01:36:49] <jak2000> hi friends
[01:37:37] <jak2000> why: <button class='btnConsultar' id='btnConsultar' >Consultar</button>        is a submit button?
[01:37:47] <duch_kazatel> because it's a button.
[01:37:56] <jak2000> but why submit?
[01:37:57] <duch_kazatel> add type='button"
[01:38:00] <duch_kazatel> see if that fixes it.
[01:38:04] <jak2000> ok
[01:47:33] <jak2000> duch_kazatel are you there?
[01:47:43] <duch_kazatel> a-hyup.
[01:49:04] <jak2000> http://pastie.org/10473684   <-- not do a submit, see line 7 why not execute the submit?
[01:49:52] <duch_kazatel> lol
[01:50:05] <duch_kazatel> you don't want to do it this way.
[01:50:38] <duch_kazatel> change the button back and bind to the form's submit event instead.
[01:53:31] <jak2000> <button type="button" class='btnConsultar' id='btnConsultar' >Consultar</button>
[01:53:37] <jak2000> remove the type='button' ?
[01:53:45] <duch_kazatel> yes.  and bind to the form's submit event.
[01:54:47] <jak2000> ok removed tpe='button' removed the jquery code....
[01:54:53] <duch_kazatel> err.
[01:54:56] <duch_kazatel> don't remove the javascript.
[01:55:01] <duch_kazatel> just bind to the form's submit event instead.
[01:55:02] <duch_kazatel> ...
[01:55:03] <jak2000> not remove?
[01:55:13] <jak2000> mmm not udnerstand can you explain me more?
[01:55:14] <jak2000> please
[01:55:17] <jak2000> *understand
[01:55:24] <duch_kazatel> does the form have an ID or class or something?
[01:55:48] <jak2000> <form name="ftarcarga" action="tarcarga.jsp" method="POST">
[01:55:59] <duch_kazatel> give it an ID or class.
[01:56:32] <jak2000> its ok? <form name="ftarcarga" id="ftarcarga" action="tarcarga.jsp" method="POST">
[01:56:33] <jak2000> ?
[01:56:42] <duch_kazatel> lol
[01:56:43] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[01:56:59] <duch_kazatel> so what what i suggested doesn't make sense?
[01:59:36] <duch_kazatel> $('#ftarcarga').on('submit', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); /* the rest of your code here */ });
[02:03:12] <jak2000> removed the: $('#btnConsultar').on('click', function (e) {
[02:03:16] <jak2000> i am ok right?
[02:03:27] <duch_kazatel> Did you replace that with what i just gave you?
[02:05:17] <jak2000> yes
[02:05:19] <jak2000> testing
[02:05:28] <jak2000> my problem initially is: 2 submits, not know why
[02:05:30] <jak2000> testing
[02:05:31] <duch_kazatel> if you have more problems, make a fiddle.
[02:05:42] <jak2000> mmm fiddlee in this case not work
[02:05:50] <Whiskey> :P
[02:05:50] <duch_kazatel> yes it would.
[02:05:59] <duch_kazatel> i don't need the form to actually work.
[02:06:01] <duch_kazatel> just the code.
[02:09:10] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: how do you suggest i add the uncomment data in thee 4 example where it says here?
[02:09:11] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/49/
[02:10:11] <jak2000> duch_kazatel: $('#ftarcarga').on('submit', function (e) {    e.preventDefault();    var widprov = $("#xcombcatprod").find('option:selected').val();    debugger;    $("#widprod").val(widprov);    $('#ftarcarga').submit(); });    its ok?
[02:10:31] <duch_kazatel> no.
[02:10:40] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle.
[02:10:58] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey huh?
[02:11:51] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: what part was not clear?
[02:12:08] <Whiskey> how to get the uncomment code on this part $("table.Info td").eq(1).find(".infoViewLineRight")
[02:12:42] <duch_kazatel> uh
[02:12:47] <duch_kazatel> by appending it?
[02:12:57] <duch_kazatel> i don't understand what you're lost with
[02:13:05] <duch_kazatel> you keep asking questions about how to do exactly this.
[02:13:38] <Whiskey> but i think that breaks the code
[02:13:43] <duch_kazatel> wat
[02:13:45] <Whiskey> give me sec to try it
[02:13:48] <duch_kazatel> ...
[02:13:54] <duch_kazatel> need to have the right structure duder
[02:14:06] <duch_kazatel> you need to build out whatever trs/tds you need.
[02:16:45] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey you were in here a while ago and asked almost the exact same question.  you should go do a tutorial on HTML.
[02:16:46] <jak2000> arghhh now ismor complex, do a 2 submits, and with empty value andnull value :(
[02:17:13] <duch_kazatel> jak2000 i can't help you unless you give me a fiddle.
[02:17:15] <duch_kazatel> sorry buddy.
[02:20:50] <jak2000> start here: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/gj0tzpve/15/
[02:20:51] <jak2000> please
[02:20:56] <jak2000> 2 submits why?
[02:21:00] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey also: could you try to less obviously build a piracy site?  thx
[02:21:12] <jak2000> clicking 1 time on btnConsultar only 1 time
[02:21:17] <duch_kazatel> ....
[02:21:24] <duch_kazatel> you're triggering the submit.
[02:22:24] <jak2000> see: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/gj0tzpve/16/
[02:22:33] <duch_kazatel> ....
[02:22:36] <duch_kazatel> same thing dude.

[02:27:04] <jak2000> 'nooooooooo
[02:27:09] <jak2000> please no byeee
[02:27:15] <jak2000> testing
[02:28:07] <duch_kazatel> i fixed your problem.
[02:28:09] <duch_kazatel> this is easy stuff.
[02:28:16] <duch_kazatel> bind to the form submit and prevent that.
[02:28:19] <duch_kazatel> l2events
[02:28:59] <jak2000> ok
[02:29:05] <jak2000> but no action
[02:29:20] <duch_kazatel> ...
[02:29:26] <jak2000> with your code and no code on btnConsultar
[02:29:28] <duch_kazatel> that's... what you asked for.
[02:29:29] <jak2000> not submit
[02:29:31] <jak2000> ok
[02:29:37] <duch_kazatel> right, no code on the button.
[02:29:42] <duch_kazatel> you don;'t care about that lick.
[02:29:44] <duch_kazatel> *click.
[02:29:47] <jak2000> then need reactivate my btnConsultar.
[02:29:50] <jak2000> right?
[02:29:50] <duch_kazatel> why?
[02:29:57] <jak2000> no submit
[02:29:59] <duch_kazatel> right.
[02:30:01] <jak2000> i need do a submit
[02:30:02] <duch_kazatel> that;'s what you asked for.
[02:30:04] <jak2000> but only 1 time
[02:30:05] <duch_kazatel> ...
[02:30:07] <duch_kazatel> uh.
[02:30:13] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do?
[02:30:16] <jak2000> i eacplain more
[02:30:19] <jak2000> explain
[02:30:22] <duch_kazatel> because you're not making sense.
[02:30:27] <jak2000> you know aboout jp or php?
[02:30:27] <duch_kazatel> make it a single sentence.
[02:30:43] <duch_kazatel> "WHen i click the button, i need to do x, then submit the form"
[02:30:53] <duch_kazatel> right?
[02:31:05] <jak2000> yes
[02:31:13] <duch_kazatel> what is x?  validation?
[02:31:16] <duch_kazatel> or something else?
[02:31:27] <jak2000> wait
[02:31:29] <duch_kazatel> no.
[02:31:32] <duch_kazatel> answer the question.
[02:31:44] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[02:31:55] <jak2000> i have a select/option..... the user choose a option, when i click on the button, i want preserve the option selected
[02:32:03] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[02:32:06] <jak2000> something
[02:32:16] <duch_kazatel> on the next page?
[02:32:19] <duch_kazatel> ooor....?
[02:32:25] <jak2000> when submit
[02:32:31] <duch_kazatel> uh
[02:32:32] <jak2000> with a sample
[02:32:36] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't make any sense.
[02:32:41] <jak2000> if i have:
[02:32:48] <duch_kazatel> if you paste code into the channel...
[02:34:04] <duch_kazatel> what do you mean by "i want preserve the option selected"?
[02:34:17] <duch_kazatel> like, when the page reloads, you want to have that option selected?
[02:35:08] <jak2000> yes
[02:35:12] <jak2000> http://pastie.org/10473721
[02:35:18] <duch_kazatel> that has nothing to do with javascript.
[02:35:20] <duch_kazatel> that's server-side.
[02:35:26] <jak2000> see line 251
[02:35:35] <duch_kazatel> hey so this is a channel about jquery
[02:35:42] <jak2000> ok.
[02:35:44] <duch_kazatel> fix your jsp.
[02:35:49] <duch_kazatel> go to a channel about that topic.
[02:35:52] <duch_kazatel> thanks!
[02:36:02] <jak2000> ok.
[02:36:12] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: what about this? http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/50/
[02:36:13] <jak2000> my problem is that do 2 times the ssubmit :(
[02:36:17] <jak2000> submit
[02:36:19] <jak2000> thanks
[02:36:30] <duch_kazatel> jak2000 because you're triggering the submit twice.
[02:36:39] <duch_kazatel> don't trigger the submit.
[02:36:48] <Whiskey> count = $("table.Info tr").length <-- its only allowed to read everything before class="MediaInfo" but not after, how do you tell it to do that?
[02:38:17] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey still not making sense.
[02:48:47] <lordjancso> morning all
[02:48:59] <lordjancso> i need a good infinite scroller
[02:49:16] <lordjancso> i just want to load images, nothing fancy
[02:50:20] <lordjancso> that would be good if i could render the whole html page, but infinite scroller should download the images from the server, for minimalize requests
[04:58:01] <justagut> hi!
[04:58:20] <justagut> theres a lot of people here!
[04:58:27] <justagut> i am hoping to make a friend today
[04:59:21] <justagut> is anyone here?
[07:51:44] <sim642> Is it somehow possible to animate only one argument of border-spacing?
[09:20:03] <Whiskey> count = $("table.Info tr").length <-- is it anyway i can make sure its not counts anything that has css("display", "none")
[09:29:05] <Meir`> Whiskey, use .not()
[09:30:35] <Meir`> Whiskey, or better, use ":visible"
[09:31:00] <Meir`> http://api.jquery.com/not/ https://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[09:42:29] <StephenS> is it possible with contextmenu to disable some of the option, from the right click on resource?
[09:52:09] <Whiskey> Yeh i found that two Meir`: thanks
[12:33:13] <z1haze> what is the best way to insert a bunch of html with jquery?
[12:33:41] <z1haze> Someone told me to use a template, but I couldnt figure out how to use a template AND pass variables into the template that are returned from ajax
[12:33:59] <taplar> create your elements using a fragment, manipulate the fragment, and append it to the dom at the end
[12:52:53] <z1haze> any documentation on this? everything i looked for hours last night implemented some sort of other framework or library
[12:55:31] <taplar> if you have a template and you get the html with ajax, you can load the html into a $() variable.  then just manipulate it however you want.  and at the end append it do the body
[12:55:58] <z1haze> what do you mean manipulate it however I want?
[12:56:15] <taplar> setting the values of elements and such
[12:56:17] <z1haze> Im just looking for some good documentation explaining what Im tryting to do, I looked for hours
[12:56:38] <z1haze> can you plug in like placeholder variables into templates and then repplace them after or what?
[12:56:50] <taplar> yes
[12:57:45] <taplar> well
[12:57:54] <taplar> depends on what you mean by 'placeholder variables'
[12:58:31] <z1haze> <template>This is a template, where we have $var1 users!</template> then swap our $var1 for the number of users or something liek that..
[12:59:07] <taplar> something like that you'd wrap your target with a tag and set the tag
[12:59:45] <z1haze> would it be too much to ask for a dummy example that makes an ajax call and in the success function appends a template in which you pass the response variables into the template?
[13:00:05] <z1haze> right now how I'm doing it works.. i just append a giant single line of code.. it does work.. but its messy
[13:00:11] <taplar> <div>This is a template, where we have <span class="userCount">0</span> users!</div>
[13:00:18] <z1haze> I'm passed the point of functionality in this project, more on the rewrite now
[13:00:37] <z1haze> yea but if its in a div it will be visible
[13:00:49] <taplar> nothing is visible until you append it to the dom
[13:00:54] <taplar> until then, it's just in memory
[13:01:29] <z1haze> if I have markup on my page of <div> wont it be visible?
[13:01:38] <taplar> no
[13:01:50] <taplar> if you do var $div = $('<div>');
[13:01:56] <taplar> that new div will not exist on the page yet
[13:02:25] <z1haze> that defeats my purpose though, I'm looking for a solution that I can freely type html markup without having issues with syntax and ' "
[13:03:11] <z1haze> I need to append like.. 4 or 4 lines of code each time something is executed, and its multilined.. someone suggested using templating to be able to just type freely, then the template appends itself and formats correctly.. i just couldnt figure out how to do that with variables
[13:03:46] <taplar> what do you mean 'type freely'?  your appending text with javascript.  that's not typing
[13:04:26] <z1haze> lets say I have a bunch of markup that I want to append to a div
[13:04:47] <z1haze> its formatted like html, with line breaks, double quotes for id=" class=" etc
[13:05:01] <taplar> sure, your template/view file
[13:05:04] <z1haze> if you do all that in an append() fucntion, it gets all jacked up and lots of errors
[13:05:06] <z1haze> yea
[13:05:11] <z1haze> thats what I want to use, I coudlnt figure it out
[13:05:39] <taplar> right, so you create your view file, get it with ajax, stick that data in var $newstuff = $(htmlvariablefromajax); and go from there
[13:06:47] <z1haze> but the variables that I need to insert/replace are scattered about the template file, some even more than once
[13:07:16] <taplar> no problem.  you then $newstuff.find('selector').val('set new val') to set your things
[13:07:17] <z1haze> so for example, $path = response.path;
[13:07:43] <z1haze> can you make a fiddle? i cant wrap my head around this
[13:07:50] <z1haze> or i can put my stuff in a codeshare or something
[13:08:14] <taplar> i can show you a live example, the ajax is wrapped some but it'll show you the values stuff
[13:08:17] <taplar> hold on
[13:08:30] <z1haze> alright I appreciate that
[13:09:50] <taplar> ok, here's one directory where i have my views: https://github.com/taplar/site-editor/tree/master/public/views
[13:10:20] <taplar> here's a file that uses some of them https://github.com/taplar/site-editor/blob/master/public/scripts/src/workspaceService.js
[13:10:26] <taplar> look at the function 'buildEditFile'
[13:10:38] <timwis> Hey guys, I'm running on localhost and trying to hit an API via CORS on a server that I have a login cookie set on. How can I get my AJAX request to include that cookie? Is there a way to include localhost in the cookie with EditThisCookie (chrome extension) or something?
[13:12:39] <z1haze> i should have put out there, that im completely crap with js/jquery.. im mostly backend stuff, jquery gets me lost but i am looking at this function.. not getting much from it though
[13:13:28] <taplar> sorry, :(
[13:13:55] <taplar> lets see...
[13:20:12] <therocode> I am using jquery ui's drag and drop API and it works fine on one of my web pages. However I am experiencing an issue on another page which includes a bit more complexity. I have tasks and task groups. Task can be either contained in groups or on their own. Tasks can be dragged into groups. However, I also have sprints which are drop targets as well, for both task groups and tasks.
[13:20:27] <therocode> So Tasks are draggables, task groups are draggables and droppables, sprints are droppables.
[13:20:37] <therocode> This looks like this: http://puu.sh/kGwvl/89035d27dd.png
[13:21:30] <therocode> My issue is with Z ordering. When I drag tasks, they appear behind other tasks/goals/sprints like so: http://puu.sh/kGwyO/02853b9313.png
[13:21:50] <therocode> However, tasks appear in front of tasks that are above itself in the list.
[13:22:40] <therocode> I have tried setting the zIndex option, I have tried adding 'appendTo: "body"' and 'stack: ".draggable"' where 'draggable' is a class that all draggables have. Nothing of this changes anything.
[13:23:05] <therocode> I don't have this problem on the other page where I just have draggables in a more trivial form, not draggables of different type and draggables that are also droppables.
[13:23:17] <therocode> Any ideas on what might be the cause for this, or how to fix it?
[13:29:06] <taplar> z1haze, alright here's a smally example http://jsfiddle.net/b7tsut8v/
[13:29:50] <z1haze> thats not using a template though thats using the same kinda setup I already use
[13:30:10] <taplar> the string is just a dummy as i don't have an ajax endpoint that jsfiddle can hit
[13:30:20] <taplar> but your code would hit your view/template page to get the html
[13:30:26] <z1haze> I want actually talking about using the html template element
[13:30:39] <z1haze> so that I dont have to have everything on a single line with no spaces and no double quotes, etc
[13:30:52] <taplar> that's what i'm saying
[13:31:08] <taplar> your template page can have it formatted however you want.  line breaks whatever.  regular html layout
[13:31:39] <taplar> the ajax gets it which creates the variable that it will use going forward
[13:31:54] <z1haze> nono, the ajax doesnt get the template
[13:32:04] <z1haze> the template is on the page
[13:32:15] <z1haze> the only thing ajax gets is the couple variables that get pushed into the template
[13:32:18] <taplar> ahhhh
[13:32:23] <taplar> well crud, lol
[13:32:34] <taplar> then all you have to do is look it up, set the pieces and show it
[13:32:37] <z1haze> in my case, the ajax returns an array variable response
[13:32:45] <z1haze> so response.path and response.image_id
[13:33:08] <z1haze> how do I insert a <template></template> with jquery
[13:33:19] <z1haze> and make sure it stays hidden
[13:33:45] <taplar> i don't think template is a valid html tag
[13:34:24] <taplar> you can have an element on your page hidden by applying display: none against it
[13:34:29] <taplar> either directly or via a class
[13:34:42] <z1haze> but then when i append it it will not dispaly XD
[13:34:50] <taplar> you clone it and append the clone
[13:35:17] <taplar> clone it, set your fields, append it, remove the class/style hiding the clone
[13:35:35] <z1haze> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template
[13:35:58] <taplar> huh, nvm on the tag then, :)
[13:36:13] <taplar> so lets see...
[13:36:37] <z1haze> it seems to be what i need
[13:36:54] <z1haze> the summary of the template says exactly what i need, (i think)
[14:00:15] <z1haze> taplar, i have to run if you are still toying with it, you can pm me what youcome up with. thanks for your help today
[14:00:36] <taplar> np, sorry i was confused about your q, :S heh
[14:03:27] <derekZero_> So I'm trying jQuery effects on an id that is a list in HTML and a flebox in CSS. I can't seem to get any of the effects to work. Ideas?
[14:07:35] <therocode> Hmm, I set the zIndex on onDragStart to 100000 and print the zIndex of the dormant draggalbes and they are all <10. However the dragged draggable still goes behind some of the dormant draggables. What could cause this?
[14:08:39] <shoky> therocode: make a jsfiddle demonstrating your issue
[14:21:40] <Sinsayer> I'm trying to $.post to mimic submitting a form on a page, but despite trying many combinations I've never been able to get the server to recognize the POST. This is my first time POSTing anything non-trivial so I'm hoping it's just a silly formatting error or something. http://jsfiddle.net/n4z736mk/1/
[14:28:43] <shoky> Sinsayer: that code posts fine.. you can see that by including jquery and running it and looking in your browser devtools network tab, it appears as a POST with those parameters
[14:29:30] <shoky> didn't really understand all your comments
[14:30:58] <Sinsayer> shoky: I looked at what Firebug saw as being posted as well, but it looked identical (or identical enough) to putting the text in manually and submitting
[14:31:41] <Sinsayer> are there situations where it's impossible to post like that? server-side setting, or something?
[14:32:22] <shoky> for a cross-origin request the server needs to allow it
[14:32:42] <shoky> but if your url is really just '' then it's not cross-origin so should be fine
[14:32:56] <shoky> don't really know about userscripts tho
[14:33:03] <Sinsayer> yeah, the userscript is running on the same page as the form (for now)
[14:33:28] <shoky> what's making you say it's not working right
[14:34:51] <Sinsayer> when a title is entered manually and submitted, the server records the new title and changes the page slightly (it's a title voting system)
[14:35:19] <Sinsayer> but when the userscript tries to post the same thing, the page does not change
[14:35:38] <shoky> well, an ajax post is not a form submit. it doesn't cause the page location to change
[14:35:48] <shoky> it doesn't cause anything to happen, except for that http request to be sent
[14:36:04] <Sinsayer> of course I have to reload the page to check
[14:36:45] <shoky> well, then check on the server logs or something what's going on.. if you see the request being sent fine from the browser
[14:37:04] <placidb> I'm wondering if anybody could help me understand how the kinetic plugin works. if I inspect the DOM after scrolling, I can't figure out how it is repositioning the scrolled content.
[14:37:13] <Sinsayer> unfortunately it's not my website, so I can't see them
[14:37:19] <placidb> specifically: http://davetayls.me/jquery.kinetic/
[14:38:18] <shoky> Sinsayer: well you'd need to check with whoever's website it is, then.. that jquery code posts fine
[14:38:30] <shoky> maybe your params are wrong, who knows
[14:45:21] <shoky> placidb: it sets .scrollTop and .scrollLeft
[14:46:48] <derekZero_> I have three buttons on a page that .fadeIn different text when clicked on. How can I write it so when you click on another buton the previous text appears so the new text can take it's place?
[14:47:03] <derekZero_> button*
[14:47:13] <derekZero_> dissapears*
[14:48:19] <derekZero_> would I use the clearqueue method?
[14:51:43] <Sinsayer> shoky: think I found it. I was basing my posted variables based off of .serialize(), but .serialize() does *not* include displaying the ' submit = "Submit" ' parameter when event.preventDefault() is used
[14:52:08] <Sinsayer> only took 4 days to figure that out
[14:53:39] <shoky> heh what kinda server needs that parameter there anyway :\
[14:54:21] <Sinsayer> billions of pageviews, only one admin/coder... guess that's the sort of thing that happens
[14:55:06] <placidb> shoky: thank you
[15:04:15] <derekZero_> Can you append an IF function to a jQuery effect?
[15:11:54] <therocode> shoky: I managed to get something similar, it's not exactly the same as my issue but it might be related. So in that case, my question is, how come the draggables from the top list end up behind the draggables in the second list if you drag the first draggables over the second list? https://jsfiddle.net/6uch7nq6/
[15:12:23] <therocode> or actually, in chrome it seems like the bottom draggables are below the top ones, not the other way around :S
[15:15:26] <derstrom> derekZero_: you can use a ternary condition like (i === 0 ? 'true' : 'false') inside method parameters - e.g. $(this).append( ( i === 0 ? 'equal to 0' : 'not equal to 0' ) ) but I don't know if this will work in your particular case
[15:15:48] <derekZero_> derstrom: Thx
[15:16:04] <derstrom> the ternary operator (this is what it is called in PHP, not sure if this is named differently in JavaScript) allows you to do if conditions on one line, essentially
[15:18:00] <derstrom> See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator
[15:19:29] * jacons slaps akkufomk around a bit with a large fishbot
[15:19:40] <jacons> e
[15:20:00] <shoky> therocode: it's because the .task-list's are themselves also draggables with the "stack" option set, so there is a relative z-index difference between them, and this in turn causes any of their children to also adhere to that z-index
[15:23:03] <shoky> therocode: and it doesnt have to do with chrome, it has to do with the last task-list you've dragged. that one will be on top, as per "stack" option
[15:27:20] <therocode> Oh, I see! That's good information indeed. So how should you reasonably handle the case where draggables are within draggables and you always want the dragged thing to be on top?
[15:28:36] <shoky> therocode: this is the first thing that came to mind, there might be cleaner ways  https://jsfiddle.net/6uch7nq6/1/
[15:28:37] <therocode> (my actual problem is a bit different though since the draggables go behind all elements that come after it in the DOM tree, not just other draggables, but maybe it is somehow related and will be solved too)
[15:29:19] <therocode> Thanks, I'll look into it!
[15:37:31] <nerium> How do I observe changes to a div? For example if someone changes its style
[15:37:48] <nerium> I tired the ”change” event binding, but that didn’t fire
[15:46:56] <derstrom> nerium: Look into "Mutation Observers". Be warned, browser support in IE is limited to v11 or Edge: http://caniuse.com/#feat=mutationobserver
[15:51:01] <nerium> derstrom: This is ran i chromium so that should be a problem
[15:51:45] <derstrom> nerium: One thing you may run into when you use the MutationObserver's observe() method, to get the DOM node from a jQuery object, use get(), e.g. $(this).get(0) to retrieve the first DOM from the set of matched elements.
[15:52:21] <derstrom> Although you can also do the same thing this way:
[15:52:24] <derstrom> $(this)[0]
[15:52:30] <derstrom> array notation or via get(), your choice
[15:54:45] <derstrom> nerium: MutationObservers are supported in Chrome from v18 and above. Until v27 though, WebKit had its own vendor prefix - so it's WebKitMutationObserver until v27
[15:57:02] <nerium> derstrom: Thanks!
[15:57:05] <derstrom> nerium: If you care about supporting old versions of Chrome, use something like "MutationObserver = window.MutationObserver || window.WebKitMutationObserver" to target both
[15:57:23] <derstrom> No probs.
[15:57:30] <nerium> derstrom: It’s a gui app (electron) so I only need to support one version
[15:57:42] <derstrom> Ah, I see :-)
[15:57:52] <nerium> Sorry, it should say desktop app, not gui app
[15:58:34] <derstrom> I really should look into Electron. I've seen lots of great apps using it.
[15:58:58] <Uhkis> like what?
[15:59:02] <derstrom> Atom
[15:59:31] <Uhkis> thats an app :-)
[15:59:34] <derstrom> It's a resource hog compared to the alternatives, but it's a really fine text editor.
[16:00:33] <Uhkis> so, any others?
[16:03:28] <derstrom> Uhkis: yes, many
[16:04:42] <Uhkis> so thats a no
[16:05:53] <derstrom> Uhkis: Wrong
[16:07:18] <derstrom> Uhkis: Maybe next time you'll be less arrogant?
[16:07:49] <DarkArtist69> what would it be called, to have say 2 options (100px x 100px) squares... when you select one it moves over and text takes up the entire 200px 100px spot...
[16:15:31] <nerium> derstrom: The event observer is being triggered multiply times. I’m I missing something https://gist.github.com/oleander/42e209d8b08f9837cdce
[16:15:44] <nerium> Its triggered even if the element isn’t changed
[16:21:30] <deth_tacks> .
[18:12:22] <DarkSector> I have a div that has a lot of dom elements within it. But I also have <a> somewhere in there. I did $(".classname a[href*='foobar']") and it was able to find it, but the selector gives back <a> elements only. How do I get the <div> with class "classname"
[18:12:26] <DarkSector> instead of the <a>
[18:13:01] <taplar> you want the parent .classname of the a?
[18:13:26] <DarkSector> $(".classname a[href*='foobar']").parent() would give me the immediate parent right?
[18:13:36] <taplar> closest('.classname')
[18:13:39] <DarkSector> ah
[18:13:40] <DarkSector> right
[18:13:43] <DarkSector> thanks
[18:14:34] <DarkSector> I am trying to remove all /twochromosomex and nosleep posts from my reddit front page. That shit makes me cringe
[18:18:19] <arc_> DarkSector can't you just go to the subreddit and unsubscribe from it
[18:18:29] <DarkSector> I don't want to login
[18:18:38] <arc_> oh ok
[18:18:58] <DarkSector> I don't go too deep into reddit :) just look around on the frontpage and leave
[18:21:39] <DarkSector> Ah bliss.
[18:23:31] <DarkSector> If anyone is interested http://pastie.org/private/bdezpgztcwgbnimnumxg
[18:24:44] <taplar> hmm, makes me kinda curious.  if it bothers you that much, why go there at all?
[18:25:23] <DarkSector> So that I can roll in dank memes while my tests run
[20:41:04] <therocode> I have nested droppables and I want to have the behaviour that if a draggable is dropped in the same droppable as it is currently the direct child of, then the drop is invalid so that revert: 'invalid' will cause it to go back. Currently I have this https://jsfiddle.net/sL15df8y/
[20:41:46] <therocode> The accept checking function is working and correctly invalidates drops, but the problem is that if an inner droppable invalidates a drop, then the outer droppable still receives the drop and accepts it
[20:42:01] <therocode> This is happening even though I have set greedy to true on the inner droppable.
[20:42:27] <therocode> Is there a way that an inner droppable can completely cancel the drop?
[21:27:00] <z1haze2> can someone show me how id submit an ajax request after confirm with this? https://ethaizone.github.io/Bootstrap-Confirmation/
[21:28:35] <z1haze2> nvm i think i got it
[21:29:02] <shoky> therocode: how's this? https://jsfiddle.net/sL15df8y/1/
[21:32:24] <shoky> therocode: this one will also revert if dropped on non-droppable  https://jsfiddle.net/sL15df8y/2/
[21:32:35] <shoky> more like the 'invalid' optio
[21:32:37] <shoky> n
[21:34:07] <therocode> shoky: Oh, nice, thanks a lot.
[21:34:32] <shoky> np
[21:35:11] <therocode> shoky: I'm a but puzzled by this behaviour btw, it seems like the 'greedy' option is completely ignored when the accept checking function returns false. Is this intended behaviour in jquery ui and why is that in that case? Seems to me like it would make sense to still perform the greedy check if it wouldn't accept it.
[21:36:05] <derekZero_> .join #web
[21:36:20] <derekZero_> XD
[21:37:00] <shoky> therocode: i'm not sure, but it seems that it's like when the droppable decides not to accept, it also gives up its greediness power
[21:37:21] <shoky> can only be greedy if actually acting as a droppable
[21:38:07] <therocode> Hm, right.
[21:42:02] <z1haze2> i did a little adjustment on my page, swapped out one alert/confirmation plugin for another and now im getting a method not allowed exception, any ideas?
[21:42:06] <z1haze2> oops wrong channel, sry
[21:46:35] <z1haze2> is there anyway that I can output which element that $(this).parent('form'); is submitting?
[21:50:37] <shoky> z1haze2 what do you mean?
[21:51:48] <z1haze2> Well, I am working with submitting a form with ajax after a confirmation, i was using sweet alert before, which added no markup to the page where the button was clicked. I think now that I changed to a different plugin that actually adds markup to the page where the popup happens, the wrong form is submitting or something
[21:52:26] <z1haze2> not too sure whats happening really, all I know is that Im getting a methodnotallowed exception, which means its probably sendign a get request, when it should be posting, meaning the form isnt even getting submitted, something else is
[21:52:56] <z1haze2> So Id liek to find out what its actually sending
[21:53:03] <shoky> you can see the request in your browser's devtools network tab
[21:54:04] <z1haze2> how can i see the payload
[21:54:26] <z1haze2> its posting to the current page is what its doing..
[21:54:28] <z1haze2> makes no sense
[21:54:51] <shoky> is this on a form submit event?
[21:54:53] <z1haze2> its making an ajax post request to the current page that I am on, which is not right
[21:55:31] <z1haze2> no, not really anyway, it is a form but im submitting it dynamically with ajax
[21:55:33] <shoky> maybe a form is getting submitted, non-ajax
[21:55:46] <z1haze2> im looking at the headers of the request like you suggested
[21:55:50] <shoky> like if you don't preventDefault() the submit event
[21:55:54] <z1haze2> its making a post request to my current page
[21:56:05] <shoky> that could still be a regular form submit
[21:56:22] <z1haze2> not when i am using url: deleteForm.prop('action'),
[21:56:31] <z1haze2> its not getting the element obviously, i just want to know what its getting
[21:56:47] <z1haze2> anyway to log or display they element that is being stored in deleteForm?
[21:57:17] <shoky> console.log(deleteFrom[0])
[21:57:28] <shoky> is there a <form> there
[21:57:36] <shoky> are you pressing its submit button?
[21:57:39] <z1haze2> its undefined
[21:57:44] <z1haze2> nope here ill show u the code
[21:57:58] <shoky> well if it's undefined that could explain your empty url..
[21:58:00] <z1haze2> i know it has something to do with the new confirm plugin thing
[21:58:13] <z1haze2> does it make sense what i said has changed?
[21:58:27] <z1haze2> this plugin physically appends markup to the page where the button is
[21:58:36] <z1haze2> so the whole parents, or closest i think is being dicked up
[21:58:43] <shoky> no idea what you're doing really
[21:58:57] <z1haze2> http://hastebin.com/ulegadeqol.js
[22:00:05] <shoky> do console.log(this) there.. might not be what you're expecting
[22:00:25] <z1haze2> and heres an example of the markup (before the confirm dialog pops up and spits shit out into the middle of it)
[22:00:25] <z1haze2> http://hastebin.com/ubigokecil.django
[22:01:25] <z1haze2> yea, see its exactly what i thought
[22:01:33] <z1haze2> this becomes the new shit that jquery puts in there
[22:01:45] <z1haze2> before it was the anchor inside the form
[22:02:04] <z1haze2> but it adds stuff in so i dont know how im supposed to grab the form i want, it needs to be dynamic
[22:02:09] <shoky> different plugins can work in completely different ways, you can't expect them to behave the same
[22:02:28] <z1haze2> oh im not expecting it, i just didnt think i would run into this issue of course
[22:02:31] <z1haze2> not sure what to do..
[22:03:14] <z1haze2> you saw the paste of the markup beforehand right? here it what it is when you click link to delete the image and get the confirm box http://hastebin.com/siloqojaji.xml
[22:03:34] <shoky> markup doesn't help me
[22:03:45] <z1haze2> im showing you whats happening how doesnt that help
[22:03:48] <shoky> you're expecting the plugin to work some way which it doesn't
[22:03:50] <z1haze2> its inserting markup
[22:03:59] <shoky> it doesn't set "this" to the link
[22:04:00] <z1haze2> and messing up my previous code
[22:04:19] <z1haze2> it sets this to a child div of the form
[22:04:26] <z1haze2> so theres no form in that div
[22:04:30] <shoky> huh
[22:04:38] <z1haze2> look at the markup man it will explain it
[22:04:43] <shoky> if it's a child div of the form, then why would  .closest('form') be undefined
[22:04:57] <z1haze2> i dunno?
[22:05:29] <shoky> then it's not a child div of the form
[22:05:35] <shoky> because then .closest('form') wouldnt be undefined ;p
[22:06:30] <z1haze2> i checked earlier what this was
[22:07:02] <z1haze2> {animation: true, placement: "left", selector: false, template: "<div class="popover"><div class="arrow"></div><h3 …<a data-dismiss="confirmation">No</a></div></div>", trigger: "click"…}
[22:08:07] <z1haze2> so its a template
[22:11:51] <z1haze2> can you help me make it work?
[22:15:37] <shoky> yeah, the 2nd argument is what you want
[22:15:38] <printForever> I'm trying to target $(this).parents().eq(2).____ID_NAME
[22:15:41] <shoky> z1haze2
[22:15:50] <printForever> what should I use to target the ID?
[22:15:50] <z1haze2> yes?
[22:16:41] <shoky> z1haze2  onConfirm: function(e, element) { var form = element.closest('form')
[22:17:15] <printForever> $(this).parents().eq(1).sibling('#myid').slideToggle('slow');
[22:18:01] <printForever> I must use parent because there are several of them on the page...
[22:18:03] <printForever> oh crap
[22:18:04] <shoky> printForever: id's should be unique so you could just do $('#myid')
[22:18:07] <printForever> I should have used ID
[22:18:11] <printForever> I mean Class
[22:18:17] <printForever> yeah shoky, I just realized that :D
[22:18:29] <z1haze2> wow that did it, what did we just do?
[22:18:35] <shoky> printForever: otherwise you should probably use a combination of .closest(selector) and .find(selector)
[22:18:40] <z1haze2> at least that is fixed, other issues tho i think i can fix it
[22:18:52] <shoky> z1haze2: we used the plugin like it's meant to be used. too bad the docs didn't mention the arguments tho
[22:19:08] <z1haze2> yea i just did what it said there
[22:19:18] <shoky> not really
[22:19:22] <z1haze2> how did you know you could pass the element like that
[22:19:25] <shoky> it didn't say that "this" is set to the link element
[22:19:34] <printForever> shoky, should I use parents or parent?
[22:19:35] <shoky> i did console.log(arguments)
[22:19:45] <shoky> printForever: you should use .closest and .find
[22:19:54] <printForever> ah...
[22:20:10] <shoky> printForever: e.g.  $(this).closest('.container').find('.someInnerClass')
[22:20:32] <printForever> ok
[22:20:43] <printForever> closest goes up the tree?
[22:20:46] <shoky> yep
[22:20:49] <printForever> to the selected... ok
[22:20:51] <printForever> got it
[22:20:53] <printForever> thanks!
[22:20:54] <shoky> ?api closest
[22:20:54] <b-ot> we got dat
[22:21:03] <shoky> stupid bot
[22:21:06] <printForever> hahahahhaha
[22:21:28] <printForever> Siri, find jQuery API closest
[22:21:47] <printForever> Hi John, I have found these several restaurants near you that server sea food
[22:22:03] <shoky> lol
[22:27:58] <z1haze2> shoky how would i turn this isnt a delegated function
[22:29:18] <z1haze2> before i was using $('#project-images').on( "click", ".delete-row-image", function(e) {
[22:29:45] <z1haze2> but now i have $('.delete-row-image').confirmation({
[22:30:10] <z1haze2> not sure how to organize it with the confirmation() function
[22:31:41] <vinex08_> hi, i got a lil bit problem with http://jsfiddle.net/vinex08/uhm26em1/   -- the effect doesnt work well on ios
[22:33:03] <shoky> z1haze2 check the docs, selector option
[22:33:17] <vinex08_> in ios    if ($window.scrollTop() >= distance) {   <-- this code is not working, the blue box stays fixed even tho windowtop hasnt reach the class c yet
[22:33:51] <z1haze2> does that mean I just pass confirmation as the event?
[22:33:57] <shoky> z1haze2  $('#project-images').confirmation({selector: '.delete-row-image', ...})
[22:34:13] <vinex08_> if you guys can hep me out :)
[22:34:16] <vinex08_> help*
[22:34:19] <z1haze2> dang man you're good, i aspire
[22:34:45] <shoky> z1haze2  or maybe you're looking for this donno  $(document).confirmation({selector: '[data-toggle="confirmation"]', ..})
[22:34:47] <shoky> ;]
[22:35:27] <z1haze2> i had to move it to a class, i plan on using this multiple places for different things
[22:36:19] <z1haze2> i have an unexpected (
[22:36:40] <z1haze2> $('#project-images').confirmation({selector: '.delete-row-image', function(e) {
[22:37:01] <shoky> yea you're missing the option/key name for that function(e)
[22:38:07] <z1haze2> huh? Sorry
[22:38:23] <shoky> you should be having something like  $('#project-images').confirmation({selector: '.delete-row-image', onConfirm: function(e, element) { ... }})
[22:38:47] <z1haze2> oh i have that its just on the line below after the function() {
[22:38:57] <shoky> hm?
[22:39:03] <z1haze2> $('#project-images').confirmation({selector: '.delete-row-image', function() {
[22:39:04] <z1haze2>     onConfirm: function(e, element) {
[22:39:14] <shoky> ok, just remove that  function() {
[22:39:30] <z1haze2> oh right on
[22:39:49] <shoky> 'selector' is just a property of that options object, same as 'onConfirm' or 'onCancel'
[22:40:04] <shoky> {selector: ..., onConfirm: ..., onCancel: ...}
[22:40:04] <putz54> Thinking of redoing a complex app in good old jQuery after I attempted in Clojurescript/Reagent and got lost in so many levels of indirection. Debugging was almost impossible with form submissions.
[22:40:45] <z1haze2> thank you, i will get it some day hoping so at least
[22:40:57] <shoky> putz54: why not go for the middle ground with react.js?
[22:40:58] <putz54> Thought I'd done all the hard work finally getting everything to render but no.
[22:41:02] <z1haze2> i guess once i reallly learn and understand whats happening, ill know where to put things
[22:41:25] <putz54> shoky: Was thinking of that but I'll bet debugging is still a pain.
[22:42:09] <shoky> well debugging tons of jquery code is not much nicer probably, for a decent-sized project
[22:42:48] <putz54> It was just SO much work figuring it all out with Reagent but once I hit form submission I was in no man's land.
[22:43:36] <putz54> shoky: I'm getting to the stage where I really resent frameworks which mess with the basic HTML, CSS and form submission.
[22:43:57] <shoky> yea i've done one small project with reagent, very powerful, but had to put it a lot of effort, and feel that i still would need to
[22:44:07] <putz54> shoky: Maybe plain old JS is the way :)
[22:44:44] <shoky> welp if you haven't tried react and are just basing it on a hunch, maybe give it a try first ;p  otherwise , i'm with ya
[22:45:29] <putz54> shoky: When you think of how many layers there are with Reagent it's total madness: JS > React > CLJS > Om > Reagent
[22:46:06] <shoky> haha it's madness but you just added Om there when it's not really there :P
[22:46:25] <shoky> om and reagent are alternatives
[22:46:45] <shoky> both are react wrappers, totally separate
[22:46:50] <putz54> shoky: I dunno about that. Isn't Reagent built on top of Om's foundations?
[22:46:59] <shoky> nope. i'm sure
[22:47:16] * vinex08_ ehem..
[22:48:27] <putz54> shoky: Well, if you know of any way of getting any idea of what's going on when a cljs.ajax (POST ... fails silently I'm all ears :)
[22:49:09] <putz54> shoky: I mean one that's a Reagent form response handler.
[22:49:22] <shoky> putz54 welp i'm heading to bed so maybe tomorrow ;] but ask in #clojurescript , i'll ping you there if you dont get an answer
[22:50:11] <putz54> shoky: May have used up my implicit quota on there recently :) but I'll give it one last shot.
[22:51:24] <shoky> ;] good luck. pm me or write me there if you want me to take a look later on.  i'm off, goodnight
[22:53:26] * vinex08_ coughhss loud..
[22:54:10] * vinex08_ spits some phlegm..
[22:57:36] <vinex08_> hi, i got a lil bit problem with http://jsfiddle.net/vinex08/uhm26em1/   -- the effect doesnt work well on ios
[22:57:46] <vinex08_> in ios    if ($window.scrollTop() >= distance) {   <-- this code is not working, the blue box stays fixed even tho windowtop hasnt reach the class c yet
[23:14:27] <aniasis> no one talks on IRC anymore
[23:14:44] <Uptime> aniasis: You just did, though
[23:15:01] <aniasis> I constantly break the mold Uptime
[23:16:06] <Uptime> tsk tsk tsk
[23:16:25] <vinex08_> aniasis: you might wanna solve my problem :)
[23:35:46] <vinex08> hellloooo
[23:36:40] <z1haze2> for delegated events, the first thing is the element that will always be on the page at page load?
[23:40:54] <printForever> shoky, are you here?
[23:41:14] <printForever> for some reason IF is true but it's not working
[23:41:21] <printForever> I tested the IF condition, and its good.
[23:41:39] <printForever> I tested the .slideToggle for the condtion, and it works.
[23:41:46] <printForever> however, IF is not updated... :(
[23:41:47] <printForever> why?
[23:56:49] <z1haze2> so im unable to slide up a table row, it just jerks
[23:57:06] <printForever> z1haze2, because of CSS
[23:57:45] <z1haze2> shouldnt jquery override that? if so what do i need to look at
