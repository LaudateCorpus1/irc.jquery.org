[10:02:32] <IHasFingers> hi guys hope we are all well. I am using firefox and after update i find that this doesnt work anymore
[10:02:32] <IHasFingers> $("#form").on('click', '.next:not(.hide),.prev:not(.hide)', function () {  alert("hello"); });
[11:39:59] <dlambert> Hey, I'm trying to make a synchronous function, so that variables that are dependant on an ajax call will wait to execute
[11:40:10] <dlambert> I'm having trouble returning value from then() though
[11:47:38] <dlambert> https://jsbin.com/rututonufa/4/edit?html,js,console,output
[11:47:45] <dlambert> Here is a test case of what I am trying to do
[11:59:32] <shoky_> dlambert: you cannot turn async into sync - if you want something to happen after the async action (e.g. ajax request), it must happen inside a .then() callback. you can't return a value from .then() to the outside
[12:00:19] <shoky_> dlambert: your line "return returnValue;"  executes much earlier than the ajax request finishing
[12:01:28] <shoky_> also you shouldn't be waiting for stuff to change with a timeout.. just do what you need after you already have the needed data from thje ajax request
[12:01:45] <dlambert> You understand what I am trying to accomplish from my sample?
[12:01:47] <shoky_> "after" being achieved with e.g. a .then() callback
[12:02:14] <shoky_> dlambert: yes and it is not possible, its one of the most common issues people have in JS
[12:02:19] <dlambert> oh
[12:02:33] <dlambert> Currently the ajax call in question on our site is async:false
[12:02:42] <shoky_> dlambert: you should NEVER use async:false
[12:02:43] <dlambert> we are trying set it back to true
[12:02:54] <dlambert> yeah we are working on that now
[12:03:14] <dlambert> So we were trying to push the synchronous part out to the edges and only use it where it is needed
[12:03:29] <shoky_> not possible. async stays async
[12:03:56] <dlambert> Aside from wrapping the caller code in then() obviously?
[12:04:11] <shoky_> that doesn't make it sync
[12:04:19] <dlambert> that makes it wait though, correct
[12:04:38] <shoky_> yes, i.e. async :p
[12:04:48] <shoky_> it doesn't make the executing code wait
[12:04:50] <dlambert> I'm just looking for some pattern where we don't have to retrofit some 300+ locations of the code base in then() statements
[12:04:54] <shoky_> it just makes the .then() callback wait
[12:06:05] <shoky_> dlambert you might want to look into async/await syntax which makes it SEEM like async code is sync.  not sure it would fit your current code but might be an easier path. but not if you don't already understand promises
[12:06:39] <dlambert> Yeah the later version of our jsbin is doing that
[12:06:59] <dlambert> https://jsbin.com/rututonufa/5/edit?html,js,console,output
[12:07:22] <dlambert> s/doing/tries/
[12:14:53] <shoky_> if you dont want to edit the 300 locations.. you'd need to load/execute all of them in an async callback, instead of synchronously on page load, or however you're currently including those snippets
[12:16:04] <dlambert> I don't follow
[12:18:00] <shoky_> i mean, only run those 300 code snippets after completion of the ajax request, and after setting the properties of your global object
[12:19:41] <shoky_> and MyGlobalObject()  would just need to `return MyPrivateObject;`  i guess
[12:24:12] <dlambert> yeah but how do I do that w/o modifying the 300 caller code snippets?
[12:25:48] <shoky_> how are those snippets loaded/executed now?
[12:27:38] <shoky_> are they all in oone .js file? 300 separate files that you include with <script> tag , or what
[12:30:29] <dlambert> all over the place
[12:30:37] <dlambert> some are in html script tags, some are in files
[12:31:01] <dlambert> There are like 2200 references to MyGlobalObject we have to account for
[12:31:01] <shoky_> sounds like quite a mess :p
[12:31:04] <dlambert> It is
[12:33:31] <shoky_> you can't make MyGlobalObject() wait before it returns a value, (at least not without adding an 'await' in the calling code snippet..)  so i'm not really sure what to suggest
[12:34:30] <dlambert> kk
[12:34:47] <dlambert> yeah I think we are up against reality now, and just figuring out we are going to update the 300 files
[12:34:51] <dlambert> Thanks for help
[12:34:57] <shoky_> np. good luck
[14:39:34] <forgotmynick> hello i have a javascript file that loads other scripts such as jquery if it isn't already loaded and jquery modal however the browser doesn't wait for one file to load and so sometimes it tries to load jquery modal before which throws an error because jquery isn't loaded. i have kind of countered this by using onreadystatechange and onload callbacks but I need to load more scripts that are dependant on the modal,
[14:39:34] <forgotmynick> another script that's dependant on that and so on.  so rather than create multiple functions for callbacks, is there any other way I can do this?
[14:42:27] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[14:42:58] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to load them that way instead of normal script tags or require or w/e?
[14:43:36] <forgotmynick> the script will be embedded on third party websites like facebook
[14:43:45] <forgotmynick> *like how facebook and twitter do their widgets
[14:43:48] <robertmaxrees> then tell them they need to load those as deps
[14:43:57] <robertmaxrees> or use iframes like they do.
[14:44:35] <robertmaxrees> ("them" being people who are using whatever you're building :) )
[14:45:19] <forgotmynick> sexy idea ty
[14:46:04] <robertmaxrees> there's a reason autoloading deps like that is... painful.  alternatively, bundle everything together into a single dependency that contains jquery, the modal library, etc.
[17:06:06] <bestdesign1> hi
[17:06:08] <bestdesign1> http://jsfiddle.net/mr73pyg1/4/
[17:06:10] <bestdesign1> wy this not work?
[17:06:13] <bestdesign1> why
[17:06:46] <bestdesign1> hmm
[17:07:50] <bestdesign1> i have no idea why lol
[17:08:32] <robertmaxrees> whatcha mean "not work"?
[17:09:07] <bestdesign1> on click the a tag not update the select tag value and name
[17:09:34] <bestdesign1> "Select value"
[17:09:38] <robertmaxrees> multiple reasons.
[17:09:52] <robertmaxrees> $("selectbox") is trying to select <selectbox>.
[17:10:29] <bestdesign1> ohh
[17:10:30] <bestdesign1> need #
[17:10:34] <robertmaxrees> i think you want ot select that ID.  also: .html() isn't what you want here, and .val('the new value') won't work, either.  not sure what that prop call is trying to accomplish, either.
[17:11:12] <robertmaxrees> with selects, you use .val() and pass it the value of whatever you want selected.  in your case, you want 1, 2, or 3.
[17:11:20] <bestdesign1> hmm you say that not can update the select box value?
[17:11:29] <bestdesign1> http://jsfiddle.net/bL1a0veu/
[17:11:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:11:49] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean by "update" in this context?
[17:12:35] <bestdesign1> give select tag own name and value and be selected like <option selected value="the new value">the new value</option>
[17:12:36] <robertmaxrees> walk me through the process here - use clicks the link, then what?
[17:12:40] <robertmaxrees> *user
[17:12:55] <bestdesign1> i want a new updated option tag
[17:13:09] <robertmaxrees> meaning you want to add another option?
[17:13:15] <robertmaxrees> or you want to select one that exists?
[17:13:57] <bestdesign1> i want to update the one and set "the new value"
[17:14:09] <robertmaxrees> update the one what??
[17:14:17] <robertmaxrees> lol there are really only 2 options here :)
[17:14:45] <bestdesign1> i want update the value="1" or what i selected
[17:14:57] <bestdesign1> with the new value hm
[17:15:17] <robertmaxrees> "update with the new value" meaning you want whatever the selected option is to change to a different value and name??
[17:15:29] <bestdesign1> yes you are right
[17:15:33] <robertmaxrees> so if <option value="1">One</option> is selected, change that option?
[17:15:46] <bestdesign1> yes or 2 or 3
[17:16:15] <robertmaxrees> sorry - modify whatever option is selected.
[17:16:31] <robertmaxrees> that's a strange UI, but doable I suppose.  do you just want to modify the text or the value as well?
[17:16:51] <bestdesign1> both yes
[17:17:10] <robertmaxrees> why not append the new option, set the val, and remove the original one?
[17:17:23] <robertmaxrees> also: why are you modifying the select that way in the first place?
[17:17:25] <bestdesign1> good idea
[17:18:02] <bestdesign1> i just try to set the select tag with new value and html text
[17:18:04] <bestdesign1> but not work
[17:18:15] <bestdesign1> and set that <a> tag to test
[17:18:35] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fc9wg324/
[17:18:45] <robertmaxrees> that's how you change the value of a select.
[17:19:05] <bestdesign1> ahh i got it
[17:19:23] <bestdesign1> and there is possible modify the selected value? with 3?
[17:19:42] <robertmaxrees> that's where you're losing me: why are you trying to modify that value??
[17:19:48] <robertmaxrees> that's a strange thing to want to do.
[17:20:18] <bestdesign1> i understand but there i want to write something
[17:21:59] <robertmaxrees> why tho??
[17:24:02] <bestdesign1> i need rethink i not know select not same like input so
[17:24:18] <robertmaxrees> so confused haha
[17:24:56] <robertmaxrees> if you could provide some info around what you're trying to ultimately build, we may be able to provide some advice :)
[17:25:03] <bestdesign1> i first think input is same val like select
[17:25:18] <robertmaxrees> "is same val like select" meaning?
[17:25:32] <robertmaxrees> selects and inputs pass values similarly in forms, yes.
[17:25:38] <bestdesign1> like how you set a value for an input field is easy
[17:25:44] <robertmaxrees> and for selects.
[17:25:55] <robertmaxrees> just so long as the select option is present, you just do what i showed you :)
[17:26:42] <robertmaxrees> you can also find the selected <option> and modify it, but that's a bad idea.
[17:26:48] <bestdesign1> yes its ok but sadly i cant not write new value for select
[17:27:01] <bestdesign1> why bad?
[17:27:12] <robertmaxrees> users don't expect it.
[17:27:52] <bestdesign1> ohh i want to add a date there
[17:27:56] <bestdesign1> what users write
[17:27:57] <robertmaxrees> ??
[17:28:05] <robertmaxrees> hrm...
[17:28:33] <robertmaxrees> can you provide more context??
[17:29:50] <bestdesign1> Option one is selected its a car part - Date when able to setup
[17:30:10] <bestdesign1> with promt and user send it to me
[17:30:16] <bestdesign1> the form
[17:30:48] <robertmaxrees> why not make the date a separate input?
[17:30:54] <bestdesign1> so he select a tag but i ask for date to setup
[17:31:02] <bestdesign1> too many inputs already
[17:31:16] <bestdesign1> i just try something new
[17:31:22] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  can you update the fiddle and show more of what your UI is?
[17:33:29] <bestdesign1> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/bL1a0veu/1/
[17:33:58] <bestdesign1> sry
[17:34:00] <bestdesign1> http://jsfiddle.net/bL1a0veu/2/
[17:35:43] <bestdesign1> I try something this result "One - 2021.03 .1"
[17:35:49] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec.
[17:35:56] <bestdesign1> I try something this result "One - 2021.03.10"
[17:35:57] <bestdesign1> thx
[17:36:28] <robertmaxrees> in a meeting haha
[17:36:56] <bestdesign1> wow
[17:37:27] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:40:26] <bestdesign1> that cool
[18:03:28] <robertmaxrees> alright, looking.
[18:04:02] <robertmaxrees> so you want the user to input a date, and then set the selected option's value to that particular date?
[18:05:37] <robertmaxrees> bestdesign1 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bka2689d/
[18:05:44] <robertmaxrees> but again, this is a bad idea heh
