[01:47:48] <slax0r> jutro
[01:48:19] <slax0r> err
[01:48:24] <slax0r> wrong chan :)
[03:15:05] <halfcab123> Anyone online ?
[03:15:26] <halfcab123> Got a brainbuster
[03:18:05] <Cork> halfcab123: don't ask for ppl ask the question
[03:20:47] <halfcab123> Is there any reason why my mustache template would not be populating values - https://pastebin.com/8Q4YgzPi
[03:22:20] <Cork> not really a jquery question, but the data structure might not match your template
[03:27:34] <whoisaCe> Anybody around?
[03:27:42] <Cork> sigh... no
[03:28:28] <whoisaCe> Lol... how can I increment an id number when creating a json object?
[03:28:44] <Cork> oldNumber+1 ?
[03:29:06] <whoisaCe> theres no number currently, so I'm attaching an id in a new json object
[03:29:23] <Cork> you prob need to create a jsfiddle showing what you're trying to do
[03:29:36] <Cork> btw are you sure you mean json and not just an object?
[03:29:58] <Cork> json is a string and objects is what you work with in javascript
[03:30:16] <whoisaCe> hmmm
[03:30:20] <Cork> json object is ex. '{"a": true}'
[03:30:41] <Cork> and object is var obj = {"a":true}; obj.a
[03:32:17] <whoisaCe> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/30e07yd9/
[03:32:46] <Cork> ya, that is exactly how you would have to do it
[03:32:57] <Cork> alternatively you could skip the id and use the array index
[03:33:07] <whoisaCe> hmmm im not seeing any increments on the console T_T
[03:33:07] <Cork> depending on what you need the array for
[03:33:32] <whoisaCe> Well this is a part, I'm trying to create select option filters based on attributes
[03:33:48] <whoisaCe> but I want the filters to match up, so I'm trying to create id's
[03:33:52] <Cork> ah, lol
[03:33:58] <Cork> you create i in the loop
[03:33:59] <whoisaCe> but keep seeing 0 in all my objects
[03:34:07] <Cork> so it is uniq for each itteration and is always 0
[03:35:02] <Cork> whoisaCe: suggestion https://jsfiddle.net/30e07yd9/2/
[03:35:09] <whoisaCe> oh im an idiot
[03:35:26] <Cork> each already provides a counter so no need to create your own
[03:35:54] <whoisaCe> just realized that var i works outside of the loop too
[03:35:57] <whoisaCe> --
[03:36:17] <whoisaCe> learned two new things today thanks
[03:36:43] <Cork> optimization number 2 https://jsfiddle.net/30e07yd9/3/
[03:37:39] <Cork> heh and an alternative structure https://jsfiddle.net/30e07yd9/4/
[03:38:45] <whoisaCe> I'm assuming each has it's advantages depending on the usage needed?
[03:39:11] <Cork> well $.map collects the return values and creates an array with the results
[03:39:22] <Cork> so if that is all you want to do it is the cleanest solution
[03:39:49] <Cork> $.extend is cleaner then creating a new object on each loop if you want to store all the data-* values on the element
[03:40:09] <Cork> but if you want to rename them or only store a few of them then it won't work
[03:40:20] <Cork> i would prob go with $.map in either case
[03:40:48] <whoisaCe> yea map seems better
[03:40:52] <whoisaCe> its like 100+ objects
[03:40:59] <whoisaCe> less than 110 though
[03:41:17] <Cork> worth noting though $.extend still creates a new object for each loop
[03:41:37] <Cork> so if gc is a consideration this isn't a good choice (though then you don't want this structure at all)
[03:41:53] <Cork> but for a few hunderd objects it normally doesn't matter
[03:42:01] <Cork> unless you run it very VERY often
[03:52:58] <whoisaCe> thanks a ton Cork
[03:53:08] <Cork> np
[04:20:28] <bigLanky> I have some checkboxes in a form on my page. Currently, I get a value or 1 or NULL from these checkboxes. On form submit, if the checkbox has class='disabled' I want to set a value of "n/a" instead
[04:20:50] <bigLanky> would I replace the checkbox with a text element or what would be the best way to do that?
[04:21:41] <Cork> bigLanky: how forms normally works (by design) is that you do <input type="hidden" name="a" value="unchecked value"><input type="checkbox" name="a" value="checked value">
[04:21:51] <Cork> then things works automatically
[04:22:06] <Cork> (the checkbox value overwrites the hidden value when it is checked, but not if it is unchecked)
[04:22:29] <bigLanky> I still want a value of 1 or NULL
[04:22:54] <Cork> uh
[04:22:58] <bigLanky> I only want it to have a text value is when the checkbox has class=disabled, then a value of n/a gets stored in db
[04:22:59] <Cork> you just said you wanted "n/a"
[04:23:17] <Cork> then change the value of the hidden value when you set the calss
[04:23:18] <Cork> *class
[04:23:35] <Cork> checkboxes doesn't provide any values to a form when they aren't checked
[04:23:43] <bigLanky> ah ok i see
[04:24:12] <bigLanky> so by default just have value="" and then when class disabled gets applied set the value to n/a
[04:24:38] <Cork> well ya
[04:24:48] <Cork> it would replace null with "" in the result
[04:25:15] <bigLanky> thank you for the help
[04:34:36] <Al_nz1> anyone here use postman?
[04:34:56] <whoisaCe> Cork: two things, is it possible to make a range with the years? and is there a better way to remove duplicates? https://jsfiddle.net/30e07yd9/5/
[04:35:56] <Cork> whoisaCe: you would have to loop and filter what you want
[04:36:01] <Cork> same for range
[04:36:17] <whoisaCe> so then I do the loop before the append?
[04:37:02] <Cork> that or filter https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
[05:45:34] <G66K> hello everyone,
[05:46:00] <G66K> im new to jquery i was wondering if this is good practice or there a better way to do it : https://pastebin.com/bGJV46QM
[05:46:58] <Cork> G66K: there are better ways, could you create a jsfiddle with the related html?
[05:48:08] <Cork> G66K: but generically i would bind a generic click handler for the different elements and use dom relation to find the target element instead of selecting it based on static classes/ids
[05:48:12] <G66K> Cork: sure but i have like six images on local how to put them on jsfiddle
[05:48:24] <Cork> G66K: the images isn't needed
[05:48:33] <G66K> ok one second please
[05:48:35] <Cork> all i care about is the html structure
[05:50:20] <G66K> Cork: here is it : https://jsfiddle.net/sjeg6w5e/
[05:50:51] <FilipNortic> and if you konw there will be only 1 element with class .item1 then you might want to consider it an id instead of a class,  for clearity
[05:52:07] <G66K> FilipNortic: thanks i will change these single element to an ID
[05:53:12] <FilipNortic> G66K: in the end it a matter of preference but in general when there is only suppose to be 1. Ids are better
[05:53:50] <Cork> G66K: https://jsfiddle.net/sjeg6w5e/1/
[05:53:57] <Cork> for the form-group toggle
[05:54:27] <Cork> same for the item* things
[05:54:54] <Cork> (still looking for the related html for that)
[05:55:14] <Cork> ah
[05:56:06] <G66K> Cork: thanks a lot
[05:56:08] <G66K> :)
[05:56:22] <Cork> G66K: https://jsfiddle.net/sjeg6w5e/2/
[05:56:29] <Cork> a slight diet of code :)
[05:58:18] <G66K> its short and nice :)
[06:03:15] <Cork> G66K: in this structure you don't need those item<number> classes at all
[06:03:27] <Cork> just mention this for clarity
[06:13:23] <whoisaCe> Hey Cork so I can't seem to figure out how to get a range of let's say <option>1990-2000</option>, <option>2001-2010</option> to work in the loop. I can only "arrange in order & remove duplicates" and append that list to the drop down. I was thinking maybe I had to do a filter with a min/max before the append? But then I would have to create new data-attributes to do that no?
[06:20:25] <FilipNortic> whoisaCe: what are the ranges in value?
[06:20:56] <whoisaCe> FilipNortic: https://jsfiddle.net/30e07yd9/5/
[06:27:24] <FilipNortic> whoisaCe: doing filter will be much easier yes
[06:50:51] <Cork> whoisaCe: you could split the string on - and take them as number
[06:56:18] <Cork> whoisaCe: so ex var range = '1990-2000'.split('-'), arr = $.map(new Array(range[1] - range[0]), function(e, i) { return +range[0] + i; })
[06:57:03] <Cork> gah wrong
[06:57:08] <Cork> whoisaCe: so ex var range = '1990-2000'.split('-'), arr = $.map(new Array(range[1] - range[0] + 1), function(e, i) { return +range[0] + i; })
[07:06:03] <FilipNortic> but something about the whole aproach feels backwards
[07:07:37] <FilipNortic> Feels more natrual to start with the ranges and select from them.
[08:02:25] <emr> Hello, how do i get mask pattern on masked element, plugin is jquery.maskedinput (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitalBush/jquery.maskedinput/1.4.1/dist/jquery.maskedinput.js), is that possible?
[08:40:08] <madprops> is jquery's .css('display', 'block') synchronous?
[08:40:31] <madprops> im getting the outerWidth() right after making it 'block' and it gives me the wrong one
[08:40:49] <FilipNortic> all js execpt for ajax is sync
[08:41:27] <Cork> a bit of exaggeration, but in this case true
[08:41:43] <Cork> lots of things aside from ajax is async
[08:42:25] <Cork> madprops: and you get the correct value "a while later"?
[08:42:56] <madprops> Cork, yes
[08:43:15] <Cork> is the element in the dom when you call .oterWidth?
[08:43:22] <Cork> outer*
[08:43:39] <madprops> Cork, i change the html and give make it's display block then make the calculations
[08:44:06] <madprops> a second later i manually check and it gives correct outerwidth
[08:44:09] <Cork> and the new html has been attached to the dom when you do outerWidth?
[08:44:28] <madprops> well i expect it to be, i expect it to be synch
[08:44:40] <Cork> meaning NOT var elm = $(html); elm.find('something').css('display', 'block')
[08:44:46] <madprops> im gonna show you the code
[08:45:13] <madprops> Cork, https://pastebin.com/heBqP586
[08:46:57] <madprops> before i set it to block it's at 'none'
[08:46:59] <Cork> madprops: and what is ml here?
[08:47:10] <Cork> or m1
[08:47:15] <madprops> just a variable to hold the outerWidth of #fmsg
[08:47:23] <Cork> (might want to use better variable names...)
[08:47:31] <Cork> ya, but what is it
[08:48:16] <madprops> it's used to make calculations later ..
[08:48:21] <Cork> ...
[08:48:25] <madprops> not sure what you mean
[08:48:43] <Cork> have you verified that the ml or m1 variable isn't 0?
[08:49:08] <Cork> meaning have you verified that the values your using is what you expect them to be
[08:49:22] <madprops> it prints 235
[08:49:27] <madprops> in that console log
[08:49:36] <Cork> ook?
[08:49:40] <Cork> and you expect it to be what?
[08:49:45] <madprops> 264
[08:49:52] <Cork> that isn't display block related
[08:50:01] <Cork> if display block: none was still active it would be 0
[08:50:13] <Cork> uh...
[08:50:21] <Cork> i meant if display: none; was still active*
[08:50:26] <madprops> right
[08:51:25] <madprops> also if i put a console with #fmsg's outerwidth at the end of the function i get the same wrong number
[08:51:45] <Cork> so your getting a different value then your expecting
[08:51:54] <Cork> meaning outerWidth isn't giving you what you expect you should get
[08:52:17] <Cork> so inspect your html and api.jquery.com/outerWidth and make sure you get what you expect
[08:52:40] <madprops> but i do get what i expect moments later
[08:52:52] <Cork> meaning something else is modifying it
[08:52:57] <madprops> but nothing is
[08:53:01] <Cork> and that modification hasn't happend yet
[08:53:06] <Cork> something is
[08:53:08] <Cork> it has to
[08:53:11] <madprops> that function is all that's called
[08:53:23] <Cork> all that your calling, but something is modifying it
[08:53:24] <madprops> oh wait
[08:54:25] <Cork> timers, events and ajax is async in js, so they can be queued up out of order
[08:54:39] <Cork> so you need to keep what does that in mind when your checking what happens
[08:55:03] <Cork> so ex. .animate() is one such example
[08:55:24] <MikeD_> also measuring height of elements that have been slideUp leaves them with zero height
[08:55:55] <Cork> MikeD_: doesn't slideUp clear that when it's done animating?
[08:56:08] <Cork> i could have sworn it did
[08:56:34] <MikeD_> you mean it restores the height but sets to display none?
[08:56:46] <MikeD_> i thought it just shrunk to nothing
[08:56:56] <Cork> kinda, it sets display: none and removes the height it added
[08:57:04] <MikeD_> but i've never had much luck making that nonsense work properly
[08:57:08] <Cork> .css('height', '')
[08:58:08] <MikeD_> in general i find animations pointless or distracting... i know, i'm a grump :)
[08:59:01] <Cork> MikeD_: i moved to only allowing css3 animations a long time ago
[08:59:25] <Cork> and browsers that don't support it (or where the user has turned it off in the browser) there is none
[09:00:08] <Cork> i find that to be a nice compromise
[09:26:50] <MikeD_> cool
[09:39:30] <yanome> if you use the WeeChat IRC client and haven't already upgrade, you should upgrade: https://weechat.org/news/95/20170422-Version-1.7.1/
[09:41:08] <Cork> yanome: whats the point of weechat over irssi?
[09:41:20] <yanome> Cork: more plugins
[09:41:29] <Cork> more? >_>
[09:41:34] <Cork> irssi has a tone...
[09:41:40] <yanome> arguably more customization
[09:41:52] <Cork> ah, might have to have a look at it then
[09:41:52] <yanome> Cork: WeeChat has a plugin repo you can use to easily install plugins
[09:42:11] <yanome> all you do is /script and then scroll down to the plugin you want and hit 'i' and enter
[09:42:32] <Cork> i rarely use a console irc client (as an irc client needs window support to be useful for me normally)
[09:42:44] <Cork> and meed using irssi for those cases
[09:43:20] <yanome> they are about the same
[09:43:28] <yanome> WeeChat tends to get more active development than irssi
[09:44:26] <__hassoon__> 'evening
[09:46:59] <Cork> ugg i just checked my channel list a wopping 172 channels >_>
[09:47:04] * Cork is an irc junky...
[09:49:29] <MikeD_> what does that mean 172 channels?
[09:49:46] <Cork> MikeD_: number of joined channels
[09:49:55] <Cork> on 5 networks
[09:50:27] <MikeD_> is that why you appear to be on only 2 for freenode?
[09:50:42] <MikeD_> or is that registered-on and not actively-on
[09:51:03] <MikeD_> just curious... i've never gone far from the 5 i've ever used
[09:51:05] <Cork> not even sure what that is suppose to be
[09:51:32] <Cork> you don't register on channels, you just join them if you like
[09:51:59] <Cork> and ya i'm active on about 20-30 of those
[09:52:12] <Cork> the rest i talk on from time to time but far from daily
[09:52:27] <MikeD_> idk, I've seen voice and op and such statuses, i've never done anything but /join so i am kinda ignorant
[09:52:47] <Cork> MikeD_: ya, that is the number i talked about
[09:53:14] <Cork> i'm op on three of those don't think i have hop anywhere (or voice)
[09:54:51] <MikeD_> interesting... but i guess this isn't the place for a meta-discussion about irc, eh?
[09:55:01] <Cork> nope :)
[09:55:23] <Cork> went off topic when weechat cam into discussion
[09:59:53] <_Justice_> Hm odd case here
[10:00:05] <_Justice_> i got; http://jsfiddle.net/vFt5K/31/ works in chromium but not in firefox
[10:00:11] <Jacquie> Guys i got problems fixing a qtip on a event selected through fullColendar does someone knows a bit about both libs ?
[10:55:54] <zampa> anyone here well experienced with jquery tabs?
[10:55:58] <zampa> jquery-ui tabs*
[10:56:48] <zampa> im trying to set a specific tab as default tab. It sort of works it loads in the correct tab (but it never gives it the class active so the user can tell which tab he/she is on)
[10:56:57] <zampa> https://gist.github.com/zampa86/1af3c1ff92810133763230385957fac7 <-- theres my gist for it.
[11:01:57] <someboi> Hi all.
[11:02:17] <someboi> can anyone please tell me how can I convert the array which is of form Array( [] => ...)
[11:02:21] <someboi> which is from php
[11:02:53] <shoky> zampa: like i said last night, you're possibly initializing the tabs before inserting the loaded html. delete lines 8 and 10,  move line 9 to after line 12.  if that doesn't help - you'll need to give more info, e.g. what's the html you're inserting
[11:03:21] <someboi> can I convert it in json in jquery?
[11:05:34] <zampa> shoky: gives the same error. (It loads in the correct tab)  It just never sets any of the tabs as active (showing the user which tab is active)
[11:06:03] <shoky> k
[11:07:16] <shoky> a live link to a testcase reproducing the problem would be best. or a link to your site. or at least, more info like i said
[11:07:41] <zampa> i really cant create a fiddle mimicing everything if you have a few minutes i can give you a link to test it live sure.
[11:07:45] <shoky> i assume clicking the tabs works ok?
[11:07:49] <zampa> yep
[11:07:57] <shoky> sure
[11:14:15] <TikityTik> Is there a way to pass data off to jquery GET success function?
[11:15:42] <ozcanesen> why sometimes we need to use .each() for multiple objects but sometimes functions directly accept multiple objects?
[11:16:08] <ozcanesen> for example .hide() can hide multiple objects without each but .css() does not change style
[11:16:59] <ozcanesen> actually my selector was wrong sorry :(
[11:18:20] <TikityTik> Whatever, I ended up using a helper function just to pass the proper state of a variable in a for loop for the GET request.
[11:21:24] <_Justice_> ?
[11:25:27] <TikityTik> So I am saving images to my public folder and serving it. However for the client, I give it the right URLs like 1.jpg, 2.jpg, etc, but it still uses the images in the old cache for displaying. How am I supposed to properly get the client to display the new images that have overwritten?
[11:28:21] <_Justice_> TikityTik: its the browser serving, um maybe something like this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20705150/is-there-a-way-to-clear-remove-a-specific-resources-from-browser-cache-rather-th
[11:28:26] <halfcab123> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43764107/mustache-js-templating-not-working-but-jquery-each-works-fine
[11:28:28] <halfcab123> ^ My question
[11:37:37] <shoky> halfcab123: that's not a question. and "not working at all" is not a problem description. that's a bad SO question  - you should fix it up, say what you expect to happen, and what actually happened.
[11:38:36] <shoky> halfcab123: also it's kind of unfair of you to make the SO answerers go through the same thing i did and see that it works fine for them... you should link to the fiddle i gave you where it works fine. obviously the problem is not in the code that's in that fiddle, but somewhere else,
[11:38:48] <shoky> halfcab123: don't waste people's time like that
[11:39:23] <halfcab123> Shoky I changed the original code, I definitely appreciate what you are saying though
[11:39:26] <shoky> really, "not working at all" is the _worst_ problem description :)
[11:40:22] <shoky> halfcab123: my guess would be that the server is not responding with the json you think it is.. did you check the browser network tab and see the actual response?
[11:40:49] <shoky> halfcab123: also i told you previously to log what mustache returns - you never did it
[11:41:14] <halfcab123> :(
[11:41:22] <halfcab123> I'm not quite sure how
[11:41:24] <shoky> halfcab123: and you can remove all that jquery stuff from your question, it's totally irrelevant/noise
[11:41:42] <shoky> halfcab123:  console.log(html)
[11:41:49] <halfcab123> The JQuery shows that the JSon object is being received and working
[11:41:59] <shoky> halfcab123: you don't need to show that.
[11:42:04] <halfcab123> oh ok
[11:42:56] <shoky> halfcab123: also your jquery code has errors..
[11:43:10] <shoky> i doubt you ran that code :)
[11:43:23] <halfcab123> camtradr.com/cameras
[11:43:26] <halfcab123> It's running there
[11:43:37] <shoky> yes?  this is running?  ('#title).append
[11:43:43] <halfcab123> But it's not the same exact code probably
[11:44:02] <halfcab123> Like I said I've got it working with JQuery but I'd so much rather use a templating engine
[11:44:06] <halfcab123> I'm open to any solution
[11:44:14] <shoky> i'm just saying you put totally invalid code in your question
[11:44:28] <halfcab123> I'm going to need a lot of ice for all these bruises
[11:45:00] <shoky> sorry ;p
[11:45:30] <halfcab123> I fixed the code
[11:46:06] <shoky> ya.. it's working fine, no?
[11:46:22] <shoky> btw next time.. the FIRST thing you should share is the link to your site...
[11:46:35] <shoky> you would've solved your problem in 10 minutes probably
[11:46:40] <shoky> instead of days
[11:46:43] <halfcab123> Good to know
[11:46:50] <halfcab123> I'll add it now
[11:46:57] <shoky> what?
[11:47:16] <shoky> oh you said you fixed the code in the question... thought your actual code
[11:47:35] <shoky> halfcab123: do you have a link to where it's NOT working?
[11:47:47] <shoky> that's what you're supposed to link to :)
[11:48:03] <shoky> (i just realized it was working on that link because it's the jquery version)
[11:48:53] <halfcab123> Oh...
[11:49:45] <halfcab123> What I noticed on the non working version was, where my template was, the html just showed <script></script>
[11:49:57] <halfcab123> like.. it removed it
[11:50:19] <halfcab123> the template
[11:51:19] <shoky> doesn't sound good :p
[11:52:57] <shoky> halfcab123: told you... http://stackoverflow.com/a/43764712/1098884
[11:53:10] <shoky> people literally wasting their time for you
[11:53:24] <shoky> they cannot possibly help you, without seeing the actual problem themselves
[11:54:17] <shoky> and you are STILL not asking any question there :\
[11:54:22] <shoky> downvoting.
[11:55:06] <shoky> thanks :)
[11:55:25] <halfcab123> How do you expect someone who doesn't understand what the problem is to properly present the information ?
[11:56:11] <shoky> i don't - but i've explained to you how to improve your question , so after that i do expect more :)
[11:57:24] <shoky> btw i would have upvoted if you'd fixed it up properly :p
[11:57:31] <shoky> downvotes are not permanent :p
[11:59:43] <shoky> and btw.... you can still solve your issue in 10 min or less probably.. if you just give people a link to where it's not working
[12:03:51] <VX> working on a userscript, $("body #timecard").val('Hours').change(); if i run this in the console it works, but if i run it on another event in the user script, the change takes effect but looks like not all the events fire, what would i be missing
[12:04:57] <VX> tried .change().trigger(); aswell, still nothing
[12:21:55] <iaj> Hi folks!  When I have a .php script on another server that generates the following output: {"success":true,"affiliate":"MGr8","hasLifetimeCommision":false}    < is there some way to have an ajax call to that .php script that logs that output to console?  Or even better have access to the MGr8 value?
[12:27:12] <robertmaxrees> iaj i mean, sure.
[12:27:18] <robertmaxrees> iaj depends on a few factors though.
[12:27:49] <iaj> robertmaxrees: I found out that I have to use jsonp, because json gets an XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://secure.affilibank.de/affiliate/get?vendor=marcgalal&product=16212. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'foo' is therefore not allowed access.
[12:28:00] <robertmaxrees> iaj you could also enable cors for that endpoint.
[12:28:08] <robertmaxrees> either one will require changes to the server.
[12:29:22] <iaj> robertmaxrees: hmmm... you mean to the endserver?
[12:29:28] <iaj> robertmaxrees: what I got right now is that: https://hastebin.com/xisinumipo.lua
[12:29:37] <robertmaxrees> the server that JSON is coming from.
[12:29:50] <iaj> robertmaxrees: but what I get then is: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
[12:29:54] <robertmaxrees> righjt.
[12:30:03] <robertmaxrees> because jsonp requires changes to your server as well.
[12:30:27] <iaj> So there is no fix to that without having access to the get.php script on the server?
[12:30:39] <robertmaxrees> you need to either enable CORS for that particular endpoint or set that endpoint up to wrap your code in a funmction call.
[12:30:57] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you'll need to proxy it through the current servber.
[12:32:18] <iaj> robertmaxrees: hmm.. how would the latter work? the wrapping up the code in a function call?
[12:33:08] <robertmaxrees> jsonp assumes you can pass a query param in the URL named "callback"
[12:33:20] <robertmaxrees> the remote server then wraps the data in that function call.
[12:33:57] <robertmaxrees> so let's say you have http://somedomain.com/?callback=foo, you'd then serve up foo({some prop: bar});
[12:34:06] <robertmaxrees> you get the idea.
[12:36:12] <iaj> Yeah kind of...
[12:37:23] <iaj> robertmaxrees: do you have an example handy of that foo function on the server?
[12:45:12] <Violinist> any1 work w flot
[12:45:22] <Violinist> chart thingie
[12:49:43] <robertmaxrees> iaj search google for how to setup jsonp server-side.
[12:49:51] <robertmaxrees> should be relatively trivial.
[12:50:16] <robertmaxrees> just gotta read a querystring param,
[12:51:00] <VX> in chrome is there a way to view all the JS variables and values, beside creating a watch item
[12:51:33] <robertmaxrees> VX you can see stuff attached to your window object.
[12:51:49] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you've got a debugger for a reason :)
[12:53:31] <VX> ok guess i need to add a breakpoint
[13:19:08] <fuzzybunny69y> hey guys I am just curous what this line of code does? $(".results header img", $widget) why do they have , $widget after?
[13:20:37] <robertmaxrees> that's the same as $widget.find('.results header img');
[13:30:18] <fuzzybunny69y> oh thanks robertmaxrees
[13:30:26] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[13:30:40] <fuzzybunny69y> I am just trying to understand this peice of code
[13:30:53] <robertmaxrees> for future reference: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[13:31:15] <robertmaxrees> the first signature definition explains that, too.
[13:54:11] <Lee> What method can I use to get all html inc the class I selected?
[13:54:22] <robertmaxrees> .html()
[13:54:30] <robertmaxrees> oh, including the selected element?
[13:54:34] <Lee> yes please
[13:55:03] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways.
[13:55:19] <robertmaxrees> just one element or..?
[13:55:27] <Lee> Let me show you my code
[13:56:34] <Violinist> angular makes those things pretty nice
[13:56:55] <Violinist> but its prety advanced
[13:56:59] <Lee> https://kopy.io/cn8xX -  duplicating the class, but I'm *trying* to change the array key so it inserts into DB correctly.
[13:57:24] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[13:57:54] <robertmaxrees> what line in here are you trying to fix?
[13:58:27] <robertmaxrees> also: var newItem = ele.replace('[0]', '[' + count + ']'); huh?
[13:58:31] <Lee> Sorry, th21
[13:58:39] <Lee> yeah that line lol
[13:58:47] <Lee> it was ele.html().replace
[13:59:18] <Lee> Basically I want to change that [0] to [1], [2], [3] etc when they hit "Add another ID"
[13:59:26] <robertmaxrees> is that apart of the HTML?
[13:59:43] <robertmaxrees> a more fleshed-out example of the rendered markup would be nice.
[13:59:46] <Lee> Yes, apologies let me show you the html when it's rendered
[13:59:51] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:00:01] <Al_nz1> morning all
[14:00:41] <Lee> src code: https://kopy.io/dXQoZ
[14:01:06] <robertmaxrees> so you're trying to update the select names?
[14:01:37] <Lee> I'm trying to replace [0] for the 3 inputs, line 4, 10 and 15
[14:02:17] <Lee> so when they git add a new ID, it would make it [1] (for those inputs), they hit it again [2] etc
[14:02:56] <Lee> They all have to be the same number as Laravel (the framework I use) doesn't like [] (where it auto increments)
[14:03:15] <Lee> Does that make sense?
[14:03:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you're making it a little too hard :)
[14:03:36] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[14:03:45] <robertmaxrees> can you edit these class names?
[14:03:48] <Lee> yes
[14:04:55] <robertmaxrees> heh, yeah, okay.  one sec.
[14:06:46] <Violinist> coffee and beef jerky
[14:11:50] <Al_nz1> hey robertmaxrees
[14:12:15] <Al_nz1> I know you said other people have implimented solutions to this - buuuut I would stil love to know if its possible to : how do you select the live search box in this fiddle : https://jsfiddle.net/KyleMit/9abm0hhy/ <- i need to select the text search area at the top of the dropdown
[14:15:20] <Lee> isn't it .bs-searchbox  or am I missing something?
[14:17:32] <robertmaxrees> Lee https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xkgwy1bL/1/ basically this.  not perfect.
[14:17:34] <robertmaxrees> but you get the idea.
[14:17:55] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 if other poeople have done it, it's obviously possible >.>
[14:17:56] <Lee> Thanks, got to sort kids out for bed but will check when down.  Thanks
[14:17:57] <robertmaxrees> aaand lunch
[15:06:14] <halfcab123> Shoky: you here ?
[15:06:56] <halfcab123> Finally found the cause of the issue, but don't know how to solve it
[15:07:38] <halfcab123> The script inside the script tags is not being saved to the template variable, it's not picking it up for some reason
[15:21:30] <Toerkeium> hello guys
[15:21:47] <Toerkeium> I've a ajax.start, error and stop setup on my webpage
[15:22:08] <Toerkeium> but whenever the ajax.error is triggered, just right after is triggered the ajax.start
[15:22:29] <Toerkeium> I don't know what I'm doing wrong here
[15:22:31] <Toerkeium> any idea?
[15:22:48] <shoky> halfcab123: i told you how to get help..
[15:22:50] <Toerkeium> isn't that when ajax.error triggers isn't any ajax going to be executed anymore?
[15:23:30] <Toerkeium> the .error triggers because of a malformed json response from the server
[15:25:12] <Toerkeium> it looks (just looks) like what I'm triggering in ajax.error which is modal <div>, makes the ajax.start triggers
[15:28:55] <Toerkeium> if I set console.log inside each script, I see: ajaxError, then ajaxStop and then ajaxStart
[15:29:50] <Toerkeium> any idea?
[15:29:57] <whoisaCe> toerkeium any fiddels
[15:30:21] <Toerkeium> let me see if I can reproduce it
[15:32:56] <Toerkeium> this is the script whoisaCe https://pastebin.ca/3806847
[15:33:04] <Toerkeium> is that ok?
[15:42:38] <whoisaCe> Toerkeium whats up with the start having a 5400 timer while error has 0? lol
[15:43:23] <Toerkeium> whoisaCe: well.. that's because I do ajax searches and tale some time (anyway 5400 is for testing only)
[15:43:36] <Toerkeium> so I don't want modals to appear before some period of time
[15:43:48] <Toerkeium> modal is just a "Please wait" message
[15:45:54] <whoisaCe> Is this being called from some where else? daysDiff()
[15:46:21] <Toerkeium> whoisaCe: sorry I just copied more than enough, no, that's not called
[15:46:39] <whoisaCe> yuea hard to tell whats wrong w.o something exactly working lol
[15:47:21] <halfcab123> shoky: I just put the babel cdn in there and am using jquery with template strings and interpolation for now
[15:47:26] <Toerkeium> I know, it's a pita reproduce it
[15:47:28] <Toerkeium> thanks anyway
[15:50:29] <whoisaCe> Toerkeium, I suggest removing components, and build each component separate so you can see the issues as you build it.
[15:51:54] <Dro> how can I get a JSON in var from a JSON URL ?
[15:52:37] <whoisaCe> dro - $.getJSON('url', function(data) {     //data is the JSON string });
[15:53:38] <Dro> whoisaCe, I tried that way with "myvar = data" inside the function, but when I type alert(myvar); after it , it say "undefined myvar"
[15:53:54] <Dro> btw, I declared var myvar; before the getJSON
[15:55:00] <whoisaCe> thats cause you need to parse it to view it in console var json = data,     obj = JSON.parse(json)
[15:55:37] <Dro> Whiskey, here is my current code==> https://pastebin.com/96VA2Y9j
[15:56:06] <Dro> hmm i'll try with parsing it
[15:57:51] <Dro> whoisaCe, not working even with parsing, Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0
[15:57:51] <Dro>     at JSON.parse (<anonymous>)
[15:58:26] <Toerkeium> whoisaCe: it looks like just right after ajaxStart, comes ajaxError and then ajaxStop won't make anything as on ajaxError ajax stopped executing at all
[15:58:30] <Toerkeium> could that be possible?
[15:58:53] <whoisaCe> Dro - did you try like this: https://pastebin.com/DXy2Lnsg
[16:00:25] <robertmaxrees> whoisaCe that won't work.
[16:00:37] <Dro> whoisaCe, I tried to add this json = null; before the getJSON, and after the function alert(json) give "null" output
[16:00:41] <robertmaxrees> var obj = JSON.parse(json); will evaluate before the ajax call has finished.
[16:00:50] <Dro> it seems that that function only work in local scope
[16:00:57] <Dro> it don't affect the variable value
[16:01:02] <robertmaxrees> heh, it does.
[16:01:07] <robertmaxrees> but only after the ajax has finsihed running.
[16:01:39] <robertmaxrees> anything that relies on that ajax call finishing needs to be inside that callback.
[16:03:10] <Dro> robertmaxrees, so how to extract the JSON to a var :|
[16:03:13] <Dro> any suggestions?
[16:03:17] <robertmaxrees> wrong question.
[16:03:20] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:03:39] <robertmaxrees> why can't you put your code int hat callback?
[16:05:15] <robertmaxrees> Dro do you understand the hurdle you're up against?
[16:06:07] <whoisaCe> Toerkeium: https://api.jquery.com/ajaxStart/ - I don't see it in the sample, but it can be cause you're not starting an ajax call?
[16:06:17] <Dro> robertmaxrees, yes, but i have a long codes.. related to that json..
[16:06:29] <Dro> no other way to get JSON from url to a var?
[16:06:45] <robertmaxrees> Dro if that code relies on the JSON, no.
[16:06:58] <robertmaxrees> thjough if it's a lot of code, I'd suggest breaking things up into functions.
[16:07:37] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have a code organization problem.
[16:08:10] <Toerkeium> whoisaCe: if I were not starting an axax call, ajaxError wound't trigger
[16:08:23] <Dro> robertmaxrees, yes maybe u're right :P
[16:08:27] <robertmaxrees> Dro heh
[16:08:37] <whoisaCe> spaghetti
[16:08:46] <Dro> well strange how javascript and jQuery don't have any way to get an url output to a var :|
[16:08:54] <robertmaxrees> Dro you'
[16:09:00] <Dro> I searched but I have not found anything
[16:09:03] <robertmaxrees> *you're fundamentally misunderstanding the issue.
[16:09:08] <robertmaxrees> okay, let's reframe this.
[16:09:44] <robertmaxrees> While that ajax call is running (which could take seconds), what should the browser be doing?
[16:10:12] <Dro> getting JSON lol
[16:10:15] <robertmaxrees> if it doesn't know what the return value of the ajax call will be, but there's code that relies on that data, what do you think would happen?
[16:10:18] <robertmaxrees> it's still ajax.
[16:10:52] <robertmaxrees> so if it doesn't know what the return value will be, it can't run the rest of the code.
[16:10:56] <robertmaxrees> so it stops doing anything.
[16:11:00] <Dro> I though things are more easy  than this :p
[16:11:06] <robertmaxrees> They're super easy.
[16:11:12] <robertmaxrees> just gotta organize your code well.
[16:11:26] <robertmaxrees> and use functioins.
[16:12:32] <Dro> ok , thank you robertmaxrees !
[16:12:36] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:14:33] <whoisaCe> robertmaxrees so set up the var in the callback function so it does it when it's done?
[16:14:42] <robertmaxrees> whoisaCe huh?
[16:14:57] <robertmaxrees> whoisaCe you put any logic that relies on that ajax call finishing inside the callback.
[16:15:09] <whoisaCe> yea that's what I was confirming
[16:15:16] <whoisaCe> i guess I wrote it weird lol
[16:15:21] <robertmaxrees> but it's more than just "set up the var"
[16:16:36] <Kamuela> I'm trying to write an assertion and am completely lost at how to get at what I need. This is angular and so element is supposed to be a jQuery selector
[16:17:01] <Kamuela> element.get(0) is <policy-compliance-button data-click-action="clickActionFunction()" data-is-policy-compliant="false" class="ng-scope ng-isolate-scope"><button class="btn ng-binding btn-default" type="button" data-ng-click="clickAction()" data-ng-class="className"><span class="sr-only ng-binding"></span></button></policy-compliance-button>
[16:17:08] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[16:17:17] <Kamuela> I'm trying to get at the inner button and span elements
[16:17:23] <robertmaxrees> hahaha.  can you use a paste service or something?
[16:17:28] <robertmaxrees> super hard to read.
[16:17:32] <Kamuela> Did it end up really being that long?
[16:17:38] <Kamuela> I'll gist it
[16:17:40] <robertmaxrees> rad
[16:18:39] <Kamuela> https://gist.github.com/KamuelaFranco/99ae6826acc26911f36e535324f9ad1c
[16:19:55] <Kamuela> That's the output from element.get(0)... what does element.get(0) even mean?
[16:20:08] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/get/
[16:20:37] <robertmaxrees> grabs the dom node that sits under the 0th index in the jquery collection.
[16:21:05] <Kamuela> And that's a NodeList or jQuery object? Or a string?
[16:21:30] <Kamuela> Ok so in this one, there's only a 0th
[16:21:36] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:21:38] <Kamuela> And it returns that gist
[16:21:48] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/1eQMLeV.png
[16:22:01] <robertmaxrees> which takes you to http://api.jquery.com/Types/#Element
[16:23:28] <robertmaxrees> if you use .eq(0) instead, you'd get a jquery object.
[16:30:22] <Kamuela> Thanks, I've got the selectors I need now
[16:30:35] <robertmaxrees> rad
[16:30:42] <Kamuela> I've obviously just got the angular mock totally fscked
[16:54:51] <Al_nz1> what am I doing wrong here? my form is initalising with two stats row? one should be hidden until you hit the "Add Row" button
[16:54:57] <Al_nz1> https://hastebin.com/ayiqeranac.http
[17:14:21] <panovia> Al_nz1: Could you prepare a full JSFiddle or so that reproduces the problem? Pasting your code into one seems to work fine
[17:14:34] <panovia> i.e. https://jsfiddle.net/L1r0goaz/
[17:22:51] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 fwiw your code will result in an invalid document
[18:08:14] <graingert> Al_nz1: avoid clone
[18:08:38] <graingert> And make sure you don't clone an element with an ID
[19:01:41] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeee
[19:42:01] <Al_nz1> in terms of the selection this line is making - what does it mean?
[19:42:32] <Al_nz1> the first line I can see is a class
[19:42:48] <Al_nz1> $('.selectpicker').selectpicker().ajaxSelectPicker({
[19:42:52] <Al_nz1> thats the line
[19:43:17] <Al_nz1> .selectpicker runs a function?
[19:43:25] <Al_nz1> ditto for .ajax?
[19:48:18] <Violinist> how do i get the width of the scrolled element
[19:48:46] <Violinist> but the width of the container tho
[19:49:31] <Violinist> oh i think i got it
[19:49:34] <Violinist> its the parent
[19:55:23] <graingert> Al_nz1: () runs a function
[19:55:33] <graingert> . is the attirbute lookup operator
[19:55:43] <graingert> together they can run a method
[19:56:18] <graingert> Al_nz1: just use react like I said before
[20:31:13] <bluereign> I am new to AJAX and JQuery and working on a like button. Do I need to get the database value on page load? Or can AJAX do that without submitting initially? ... I need to get currect like status on page load, right?
