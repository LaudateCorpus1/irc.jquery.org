[00:00:10] <Cork> rasu: it's when an event propagates from a child element to the parent to its parent ... all the way up to document
[00:00:12] <_rgn> the widget is a property of the main instance
[00:00:19] <_rgn> myObj.elem
[00:00:29] <Cork> rasu: you can't do delegation without it
[00:00:41] <Cork> _rgn: ok?
[00:00:49] <_rgn> yes, I could probably do myObj.elem.on('my-event', ...
[00:01:05] <_rgn> a nicer API would be myObj.on('my-event', ...
[00:01:13] <Cork> _rgn: .on?
[00:01:17] <_rgn> brb
[00:01:32] <Cork> wait are you exposing this to the page or is it meant to be internal on the widget?
[00:02:29] <ionico> hi
[00:03:18] <ionico> how can i get the class name of a checkbox when user click on it?
[00:03:48] <rasu> Cork: i am not realy sure how you meen i shall solve this-
[00:04:15] <Cork> ionico: you can't you can get class names (plural)
[00:04:25] <Cork> or you can check for a specific class
[00:04:40] <Cork> rasu: you need to attach the event listener directly on the iframe
[00:06:17] <rasu> ok you mean that i cant do it to a dynamicly added iframe?
[00:07:28] <Cork> rasu: you can
[00:07:40] <Cork> but you need to add the event listener explicitly every time you add one
[00:08:41] <rasu> ok i shall try
[00:09:16] <ionico> are you sure it is not posible to get the class name of a checkbox?
[00:09:44] <Cork> ionico: you can't get "class name" cause there isn't a limit to only have one classname on dom elements
[00:09:52] <Cork> you can get class names
[00:10:04] <Cork> meaning all the class names added to the element
[00:10:18] <Cork> or you can check for a specific one if you want
[00:11:15] <ionico> yes thats what i want check for a specific one
[00:11:32] <Cork> $(this).hasClass('')
[00:17:33] <_rgn> Cork: expose outside
[00:18:17] <Cork> _rgn: well then $('target of widget').yourWidget().on('') should be the most obvious syntax
[00:18:46] <_rgn> there's on event api on my object
[00:19:05] <Cork> you don't have events on objects
[00:19:11] <Cork> events is structure of the dom
[00:19:38] <Cork> if you want to do it some object you expose, then callbacks is the only logical way
[00:21:44] <lite> Please tell me im understanding this correctly. The Size annotaded below each snapshot is the memory currently allocated in the heap, correct? http://imgur.com/9d7wfOO
[00:29:18] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:35:26] <Lurzino> hello everyone!
[00:37:31] <Lurzino> I have a little javascript code: for (t=0; t<max_t; t++) { console.log("value: " + $('input[id*="status_'+t+'"]').attr('id') ); } but it returns me always 'undefined' value... why? (I have some input tags with id = status_0, status_1... and so on...)
[00:38:22] <Cork> Lurzino: you really shouldn't abuse id's like that...
[00:38:45] <Cork> Lurzino: anyway the undefined is cause the selector doesn't match an element
[00:40:25] <Lurzino> Cork in fact I am thinking about how I can find the selector inside a for..
[00:40:38] <Cork> Lurzino: you can do that
[00:40:44] <Cork> but your selector doesn't work
[00:40:51] <Cork> the loop isn't the cause
[00:41:02] <Cork> though like i said, you really shouldn't do it like that
[00:45:11] <Lurzino> well Cork I have a page with some <tr><td></td><td></td>...<td></td></tr> and in the first <td> i have a checkbox where I manage the click event and I wanted to match the input's checkbox button inside last <td></td>
[00:45:57] <Cork> Lurzino: match it to what?
[00:48:29] <Lurzino> and I have sort of: $(document).ready(function () { for (var t=0;t<max_t;t++) { $("#activate_device_"+t).click(function () { console.log(" button name: " + $('input[id^="rt_status_'+t+'"]').attr('id') ); });  }
[00:49:05] <Cork> ugg
[00:49:15] <Cork> Lurzino: can you make a jsfiddle.net with this?
[00:49:20] <Cork> that code can be cleaned up a lot
[00:49:29] <Lurzino> ok lemme do an example
[00:51:58] <Whiskey> If i have "<span class="dataViewBox-This" title="something'">/ This</span>" and will change the title in there how do i do that?
[00:52:20] <Cork> uh
[00:52:23] <Cork> you change it?
[00:52:56] <Cork> ?api attr
[00:52:56] <b-ot> Cork: .attr(): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[00:53:09] <Whiskey> aha :)
[01:03:38] <Whiskey> Cork, what about this "$(".Link.a").attr("href", "test");"
[01:03:54] <Cork> what about it?
[01:04:17] <Whiskey> it did not work
[01:04:21] <Whiskey> but it looks like i did right
[01:04:31] <Cork> check that the selector matches
[01:06:51] <Whiskey> whats that?
[01:09:25] <lite> So ive been taking snapshots of various web pages(gmail, theverge etc) and it would appear that they all have heaps that accumulate over time. why is this? is there something fundamental im missing or am I correct in thinking that the heap size should be more or less constant given enough time ?
[01:09:33] <TheJHNZ> can parent accept an amount variable ?
[01:11:13] <Whiskey> Cork: here http://jsfiddle.net/nN5JH/3/
[01:12:07] <Cork> Whiskey: you know how css selectors work right?
[01:12:26] <Whiskey> not really
[01:13:11] <Cork> Whiskey: feels like you should start here http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/1-introduction-to-the-web-standards-cur
[01:13:18] <vhsjon> hi guys, I have an html/JS cordvoa app, and I have a little problem. Im using css display:block/none and z-index for my navigation. The thing is that when I press an item in a ul to navigate to a new "page" (SPA), it also triggers a touch on the element that is located at the same y-coordinate as the ul item I pressed to navigate. If I call event.p
[01:13:18] <vhsjon> reventDefaiult(); when on the "touchend" event, this does not happen, but then I have to press "very hard" to choose elements such as drop downs. Any ideas?
[01:13:22] <Cork> and learn the basics of web creation
[01:14:11] <Whiskey> Cork: was on http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp
[01:14:22] <Cork> that explains a lot
[01:14:28] <Cork> Whiskey: w3schools is junk
[01:14:37] <Whiskey> why?
[01:14:44] <Cork> ?g w3fools
[01:14:45] <b-ot> Cork: W3Fools – A W3Schools Intervention → http://www.w3fools.com/
[01:14:46] <Whiskey> sloved my problem :D
[01:15:31] <Cork> Whiskey: cause 1. it teaches bad practices, 2. it is ie centric, 3. it lies, 4...
[01:15:53] <Whiskey> :/
[01:16:26] <Cork> yes sadly enough it is the first hit you get when you search on web related stuff
[01:16:36] <Cork> but it is cause it's been around since the 90's
[01:16:47] <Cork> and well back then the web was kinda a different thing
[01:21:41] <Whiskey> :/
[01:23:35] <lessless_> folks, how to add custom methods to jquery plugin (https://github.com/stefangabos/Zebra_Datepicker/blob/master/public/javascript/zebra_datepicker.src.js) in runtime?
[01:24:21] <lessless_> I tried to $.fn.Zebra_DatePicker.foo = function() {console.log('bar')}, but this do not work
[01:26:00] <Cork> lessless_: where are you trying to add it?
[01:26:09] <Cork> meaning where is it meant to be used in the plugin?
[01:26:33] <lessless_> in onSelect() methid
[01:26:36] <lessless_> method
[01:27:56] <Cork> so you want to change the onSelect?
[01:28:17] <aeroraver> is there someone who has experience with jsTree?
[01:29:20] <Cork> lessless_: $('selector').data('Zebra_DatePicker').settings.onSelect looks like it should be the target you want
[01:36:02] <lessless_> Cork, hm, maybe my english does not clearly describe what I want to achieve :) Sorry for that and let me try again one more time, please :) Here is the code https://gist.github.com/dirty-hippie/b2e22fa8a8978664618a What I want to do is to move utilityMethods somewhere else, outside onSelect body
[01:36:54] <Cork> ugg coffie...
[01:37:39] <Cork> lessless_: why would they be attached to the plugin at all?
[01:37:46] <Cork> doesn't look like there is a reason for that
[01:37:51] <lessless_> right
[01:38:16] <lessless_> probably they should not be attached to the plugin
[01:38:42] <lessless_> I like that :)
[01:39:44] <lessless_> Cork, so what is a good place for them?
[01:40:11] <Cork> lessless_: depends on your need
[01:40:28] <Cork> if you need it locally somewhere
[01:40:36] <Cork> create a scope (function() {})()
[01:40:44] <Cork> and just have everything in there
[01:40:56] <Cork> and just define the functions scope globally
[01:41:05] <Cork> if they need to exist in the pages global scope
[01:41:10] <Cork> create a namespace
[01:41:37] <Cork> window.namespace_of_your_choice = { func1: function func1() {} }
[01:41:54] <aeroraver> can someone tell me how to trigger an anchor using jquery? I'm using jsTree, but it overwrites the anchors i've defined in my html
[01:42:23] <Cork> aeroraver: if you mean to trigger a normal page load; you can't
[01:43:19] <aeroraver> Cork: So there's no way to use the links i've defined?
[01:43:46] <Cork> aeroraver: if something always kills the normal behavior, yes
[01:44:09] <Cork> you can work around it somewhat through window.location link.href
[01:44:15] <Cork> but it won't behave like a normal link
[01:44:24] <aeroraver> The jsTree documentation  says that if you already have defined anchors you have to catch the event and do something with that
[01:44:55] <lessless_> Cork, "and just define the functions scope globally" - what do you mean? the context of the onSelect() is the $.Zebra_DatePicker
[01:44:55] <aeroraver> well that's what i want to know, i know it can't be used normally
[01:45:09] <lessless_> so how do I access them than?
[01:46:22] <Cork> lessless_: isn't it callbacks you use in your page?
[01:47:30] <lessless_> reformulate, please :)
[01:50:49] <aeroraver> can someone tell me what i'm doing wrong here: http://pastebin.com/fSBihF1Z
[02:00:06] <tirengarfio> Im trying to start with masonry but I don't understand exactly how it works  columnWidth.. I have this example: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/wGcav First of all: what are the units for columnWidth? pixels? percentage?
[02:02:23] <fabioportieri> tirengarfio: afaik pixels
[02:02:58] <fabioportieri> playing with your fiddle i guess they represent the column width in which you put your images
[02:03:17] <fabioportieri> so if you specify a smaller width then the image width, the image width overrides it
[02:03:23] <fabioportieri> like in your fiddle
[02:04:15] <tirengarfio> mmm
[02:04:48] <tirengarfio> I dont understand exactly.. Im going to insert images in that fiddle, and show you again the fiddle
[02:05:13] <fabioportieri> tirengarfio: imagine you are creating a table for your images layout
[02:05:27] <tirengarfio> yes
[02:05:33] <fabioportieri> column width is the width of your columns in the table
[02:06:30] <fabioportieri> you are saying put the width for my columns to 30 px
[02:06:41] <fabioportieri> but if the image is 200 px it doesn't fit
[02:06:51] <tirengarfio> ok, I see somethink a bit clearer
[02:07:45] <tirengarfio> I have set the columnWidth to 50 and the container to 200 and 300 and it creates 4 and 6 columns respectively
[02:08:09] <fabioportieri> it makes sense
[02:25:38] <nicolas_FR> hi there ! Anyone know if javascript can do a mod on a 34 size length number ? (with accurate results ?)
[02:26:28] <Cork> nicolas_FR: js bit actions is always 32bit
[02:26:36] <Cork> so no
[02:27:22] <nicolas_FR> Cork: but I can stock this 34 length number in a var ?
[02:27:52] <Cork> nicolas_FR: numbers are dubbles in js
[02:27:54] <Cork> so yes
[02:27:59] <nicolas_FR> Cork ok thanks
[02:29:00] <lemonsparrow> hi... I have <div id="container"> <div class="xx"></div> </div>  is there a way i can insert an element right inside container as first child
[02:29:46] <lemonsparrow> I want the new element before .xx and inside #container
[02:30:04] <lemonsparrow> I don't want to use .before(''.xx')
[02:30:12] <Cork> nicolas_FR: hmm actually sorry
[02:30:21] <r00s3v3lt> lemonsparrow: insertBefore?
[02:30:29] <Cork> 34 numbers in a variables would be bigger then a double
[02:30:31] <Cork> though wrong there
[02:31:03] <nicolas_FR> Cork: damn.. I will have to split all that.. boring bank controls
[02:31:22] <Cork> nicolas_FR: 2^53 is max
[02:31:27] <lemonsparrow> r00s3v3lt: same as before() just the order would be different... if I use .before() i will have to add elements in reverse order... is there a way to use #container and appened elements right below it ?
[02:31:45] <Cork> nicolas_FR: meaning 9007199254740992
[02:32:06] <Cork> nicolas_FR: so you are prob better of spliting that number up into sections
[02:32:10] <lemonsparrow> Cork: any idea on above ?
[02:32:13] <nicolas_FR> Cork : I'm working with XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX numbers
[02:32:29] <Cork> nicolas_FR: like i said, you better off spliting it up
[02:32:42] <nicolas_FR> Cork : yep, thanks for the infos
[02:33:11] <Cork> lemonsparrow: .after() ?
[02:33:57] <Cork> js> print(Number.MAX_VALUE)
[02:34:00] <b-ot> Cork: 1.7976931348623157e+308
[02:34:05] <Cork> heh...
[02:34:08] <Cork> nicolas_FR: ^
[02:34:46] <Cork> nicolas_FR: very modern browsers has data structures you could use
[02:34:51] <nicolas_FR> Cork : I tested a mod with jsfiddle and result was wrong...
[02:34:59] <Cork> though it is VERY experimental so the support is very low
[02:35:18] <Cork> nicolas_FR: like i said before mod isn't 60bit
[02:35:21] <Cork> it's 32bit
[02:35:35] <Cork> variables can have bigger values then you can do bit operations on
[02:35:40] <nicolas_FR> Cork : hop, going to mod a splitted number. Yeepee
[02:35:44] <Cork> ugg sorry mod isn't big >_<
[02:35:57] <Cork> nicolas_FR: have fun ^^'
[02:36:50] <lemonsparrow> Cork: doesn't work
[02:36:59] <lemonsparrow> Cork: $('<h1 style="margin-bottom:-5px">').text("Hello").after('#container');
[02:37:12] <Cork> insertAfter if you write in in that order
[02:37:34] <seutje> yeah, can't place shit after an element that isn't in the DOM
[02:39:41] <Cork> nicolas_FR: fyi this one is a little cool http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:typed_objects
[02:39:52] <lemonsparrow> Cork: thanks
[02:41:12] <nicolas_FR> Cork: max seems to be uint32 no ? or would the float64 do the tricks as I'm not using float
[02:41:28] <Cork> nicolas_FR: not for typed_objects no
[02:42:31] <nicolas_FR> Would anyone know a simple way to get the position of a letter in the alphabet ? like A=0 (or 1), B = 1, etc. ?
[02:43:01] <nicolas_FR> beside creating an alphabet array and searching for the letter pos
[02:43:14] <Cork> nicolas_FR: depends a bit
[02:43:21] <Cork> ascii or unicode?
[02:43:38] <nicolas_FR> only A-Z
[02:45:24] <Cork> js> print('B'.charCodeAt(0)-64)
[02:45:27] <nicolas_FR> Cork: sorry was easy, a string with ABCDE... and indexOf
[02:45:29] <b-ot> Cork: 2
[02:45:34] <nicolas_FR> oh
[02:45:35] <nicolas_FR> better
[02:45:45] <nicolas_FR> thanks
[02:45:50] <Cork> np
[02:47:04] <fabioportieri>  >>console.log("3");
[02:47:16] <fabioportieri> sorry, how do i trigger the bot?
[02:47:28] <Cork> js> print("hello")
[02:47:30] <b-ot> Cork: hello
[02:47:36] <fabioportieri> oh, thanks Cork
[02:47:41] <lemonsparrow> Cork: insertAfter() is appending value right after #container... I want it appended right inside #container as first child
[02:47:55] <Cork> ah
[02:47:59] <Cork> ?api prepend
[02:47:59] <b-ot> Cork: .prepend(): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/

[03:10:58] <MacroMan> Is there an event that fires when a select is closed by clicking on the currently selected item?
[03:11:36] <MacroMan> I need to perform an action even if the current option is selected
[03:12:08] <MacroMan> Neither .blur() nor change() have the behaviour I need.
[03:13:27] <Cork> MacroMan: only option i know of would be the click event
[03:13:43] <Cork> blur fires when you move focus
[03:14:41] <MacroMan> Actually mouseup() would work quite well
[03:14:47] <MacroMan> Cork thanks
[03:15:08] <Cork> MacroMan: don't forget keyboard navigation
[03:15:16] <MacroMan> As it wouldn't fire when the select was closed by clicking outside the dropdown
[03:15:22] <nicolas_FR> can't I use RegExp.$1 in a replace ? : var regex = text.replace(patt,RegExp.$1.charCodeAt(0)-65);
[03:15:56] <MacroMan> Cork, I'm not concerned with keyboard navigation in this case. It's an internal system, so no real accessability to think about atm.
[03:16:22] <Cork> MacroMan: well it isn't hard to do
[03:16:57] <Cork> nicolas_FR: that isn't valid no
[03:17:01] <MacroMan> True. Actually, I think I will need to support it for what I want to even work. Will need a keyup() event as well.
[03:17:03] <Cork> nicolas_FR: you need to use a callback function
[03:17:49] <Cork> nicolas_FR: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace#Specifying_a_function_as_a_parameter
[03:18:10] <Cork> MacroMan: ya, just check for charCode 13
[03:18:43] <nicolas_FR> Thanks again Cork )
[03:19:04] <MacroMan> Cork isn't 13 return? I would need to support tab as well.
[03:19:18] <Cork> MacroMan: it is
[03:19:26] <Cork> so 8 and 13 then :)
[03:19:41] <Cork> you might also want space
[03:19:47] <MacroMan> You've got good memory.
[03:20:09] <MacroMan> I think it would be easier to check for anykey except the arrow keys
[03:20:15] <Cork> childhood damage :)
[03:20:46] <Cork> i coded WAY to much in my youth
[03:20:54] <Cork> i prob won't ever forget the ascii table ^^'
[03:21:42] <MacroMan> hehe. I started back in 92 with a commadore 64
[03:21:43] <MacroMan> I can still write games in basic lol
[03:22:04] <Cork> i started back in the 80's
[03:22:14] <Cork> in a ibm pc
[03:22:52] <MacroMan> I'm not old enough to remeber that. I only entered the world in 86
[03:23:37] <pragma-> I once almost dropped a stack of punch cards.
[03:24:02] <Cork> heh punch cards; not THAT is pre my time ^^
[03:24:06] <Cork> *now
[03:28:26] <MacroMan> I have a single punch card at home.
[03:28:35] <MacroMan> I think it's got some pascal on it, but not sure.
[03:28:56] <Cork> ah, pascal i LOVED that language
[03:30:05] <Whiskey> is it possible to remove object from source view whitout reload page?
[03:30:32] <Cork> Whiskey: no
[03:30:55] <Cork> source view only shows you what was on in the html when the html page loaded
[03:30:58] <Cork> it isn't live
[03:31:20] <MacroMan> But you can view the source in the element inspector in Chrome which is live
[03:31:32] <Cork> sure
[03:31:42] <MacroMan> so remove() would remove it from that source.
[03:31:44] <Cork> but that isn't source view
[03:31:49] <MacroMan> true
[03:31:49] <Whiskey> yeh it was what i thinke
[03:31:50] <Whiskey> yeh it was what i thinked
[03:31:57] <Cork> the dom inspector view yes
[03:32:16] <Whiskey> Time for some shower :D
[03:56:15] <MacroMan> Cork, for interest tab is keycode 9 not 8.
[03:56:24] <Cork> ah right
[03:56:32] <Cork> what was 8...
[03:56:36] <Cork> backspace?
[03:56:59] <Cork> yup
[03:58:27] <xqo> hi, the video on this page is resizing correctly in chrome and internet explorer, but it acts completely different in firefox.. what can I try? http://nana.io/
[03:58:44] <xqo> it uses javascript/jquery to resize the video.
[03:59:15] <e-anima> hi. i have an element. its a slideshow where one image slides after another. what i want to to now is react on the changing image. in my test i want to print FOO when the image changes. the problem i have no ide what event i need. "change" doesnt work
[04:02:59] <bigbugjava> Hi guys, I want to have 2 pictures in the same place, normaly you see one picture, and on hover and other one comes. how can I create that?
[04:03:11] <MacroMan> e-anima, You'll need to test against the element position in a setTimout()
[04:03:40] <e-anima> hm. the image is always in the same position. just the source changes
[04:04:19] <MacroMan> bigbugjava, Use .attr('src', 'newImageSrc.jpg') to update the image src. You can use .hover() event to detect the hover.
[04:04:46] <bigbugjava> ummm let me test if I understand, brb, thanks
[04:04:48] <e-anima> bigbugjava i would use css for that. n oneed for jquery
[04:04:49] <MacroMan> e-anima, You'll need to provide an example as I struggle to understand how an image 'slides' if it never moves.
[04:04:55] <e-anima> css has :hover event
[04:05:09] <MacroMan> +1 didn't think about that.
[04:05:30] <e-anima> MacroMan thx. i think i now have something to think/work on
[04:06:31] <bigbugjava> lets say css, #FbPic:hover {?}
[04:06:46] <MacroMan> bigbugjava, Yes
[04:07:21] <e-anima> if it is non dynamic you could use a sprite
[04:07:24] <bigbugjava> MacroMan there is no .attr('src' 'url') with css
[04:07:40] <e-anima> if this is some kinf of image gallery with a crop you need js/jq
[04:08:01] <e-anima> bigbugjava what exactly are you doing/your plan
[04:08:01] <MacroMan> bigbugjava, Use the background-image rule in css
[04:08:24] <bigbugjava> just change image on hover, it's a form picture, make it look nice
[04:08:32] <bigbugjava> MarcoMan trying
[04:08:48] <e-anima> ah ok. then its non dynamic. you can use a sprite
[04:08:58] <e-anima> and change tha background position on hover
[04:09:10] <e-anima> you know what a sprite is?
[04:09:19] <MacroMan> bigbugjava, Example: http://jsfiddle.net/sP3WJ/
[04:13:45] <bigbugjava> MarcoMan wierdly dones't work for me, will test it.. saw the fiddle it's perfect
[04:13:46] <bigbugjava> thanks
[04:14:06] <bigbugjava> e-anima I dont know what is sprite mate
[04:14:41] <e-anima> means you put two images in one. saves requests. you can then user background-position to change the image om hover
[04:16:17] <bigbugjava> examples?
[04:20:51] <bigbugjava> MacroMan I'm using the Jquery way.. on hover works
[04:21:16] <bigbugjava> But no return after mouse is leaving
[04:24:04] <bigbugjava> MacroMan done it with hover and onmouseleave
[04:28:11] <MacroMan> bigbugjava, No need for on mouseleave. You can have 2 functions in hover(). The first for onhover and the second for onhoverout
[04:28:45] <MacroMan> bigbugjava, http://pastie.org/8704689
[04:28:59] <MacroMan> from the docs at http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[04:29:01] <clime> hey, if I bind an event like this:  $('#foobar .overlay:first').click(callback); how can I then unbind that specific callback on click?
[04:31:32] <clime> is this a way? 	$('#foobar overlay:first').unbind('click', 'callback');
[04:36:20] <MacroMan> clime, http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[04:36:39] <MacroMan> Or use .off() i've you done a bind via .on()
[04:39:00] <MacroMan> Is there a bot in this room?
[04:56:59] <Uhkis> ?api unbind
[04:57:00] <b-ot> Uhkis: .unbind(): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[04:57:10] <Uhkis> MacroMan: there you go :-)
[05:08:37] <interop_madness> when passing an object of attributes to $.attr(), is there any way to represent attribute names containing dashes for non-standard attributes?
[05:13:01] <Cork> interop_madness: { "":"" }
[05:19:11] <sess> What is the "proper" way to merge 2 columns from a json data source using datatables plugin?
[05:19:44] <sess> mData: null combined with fnRender seems right, but sorting breaks
[05:21:04] <jax> if i do something like target = self.closest('tr').next('tr'); how can i get the first td in that tr?
[05:21:55] <Cork> jax: children().first() ?
[05:22:14] <Cork> jax: also it is utterly pointless to do next('tr')
[05:22:17] <Cork> just do next()
[05:22:23] <Cork> there can't be anything but tr in there
[05:22:37] <sess> there can be if the markup designed is bad :>
[05:22:43] <Cork> nope
[05:22:46] <jax> a bit more explicit from a code readability point of view ;)
[05:22:52] <Cork> cause that will be corrected before it can end up in the dom
[05:23:23] <sess> depends on the browser, I just had to fix <table><form><tr></tr></form></table>
[05:23:37] <sess> that worked in earlier IE versions :d
[05:23:38] <MacroMan> Uhkis, Is there any docs on the bot, or is it just api lookup?
[05:23:43] <Cork> sess: well ya
[05:23:45] <jax> is there an easy way to get the number of columns from within a row?
[05:23:49] <Cork> i don't count browsers that don't have a dom
[05:24:09] <Cork> .children().length
[05:24:11] <jax> .children.len..
[05:24:12] <jax> thx
[05:24:17] <sess> though I guess what's dislpayed in the debug tool isnt necessary what exists in the dom exactly
[05:24:27] <Cork> sess: it is
[05:24:35] <Cork> sess: old ies didn't use a dom tree
[05:24:47] <Cork> it actually used the raw text stream as the backend
[05:24:59] <Cork> so you could get infinite loops and all kind of mad things in ie
[05:25:14] <Cork> like a child being the parent of it's parent
[05:25:53] <Cork> div1.parent == div2;  div1.parent.parent == div1 (WHAT?!?)
[05:25:54] <jax> awesome, thanks all!
[05:26:37] <Cork> so old ie could actually keep the markup for html, no matter how broken it was
[05:26:43] <Cork> cause it actually used the html as the backend
[05:28:12] <Cork> but all sain modern browsers would have lifted the tr's out of the form element
[05:28:25] <Cork> and added the form empty as the first child in the table
[05:28:52] <sess> Cork: ugh
[05:28:56] <sess> I feel bad just hearing that
[05:29:00] <Cork> so <table><form><tr></tr></form></table> would become <table><form></form><tbody><tr></tr></tbody></table>
[05:29:10] <Cork> sess: well the html is invalid
[05:29:15] <Cork> so it needs to be handled
[05:29:26] <sess> refered to having no dom
[05:29:30] <Cork> and the question is how to do it sainely
[05:29:34] <Cork> ah
[05:29:34] <sess> I understand that it needs to do a best effort
[05:29:36] <tpy0> is there any reason why the following code would fail to output the required attributes?
[05:29:38] <Cork> ya it was weird
[05:29:56] <sess> how could anyone possible design something so awful lol
[05:30:05] <tpy0> it works on my machine on both chrome and FF but when I try it in FF on a test machine I get undefined for the data-width and data-height attrs
[05:30:08] <sess> can't even imagine having to do operations on a text dom
[05:30:18] <Cork> cause ms has never been good engineers
[05:30:20] <tpy0> http://jsfiddle.net/p4zEn/
[05:30:23] <Cork> they are good at design
[05:30:26] <tpy0> there is the codes
[05:30:27] <Cork> or at least was
[05:30:28] <tpy0> its very simple
[05:30:36] <tpy0> which is confusing me as to why it wouldn't work
[05:30:49] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I have <br><br> and I want to append something after second <br> how can I get the selector for that ?
[05:30:55] <tpy0> are there funky rules or version requirements to correctly parse data attributes or something?
[05:30:57] <Cork> tpy0: works fine here
[05:31:04] <tpy0> it works fine here too
[05:31:10] <tpy0> but in a more complex scenario
[05:31:15] <tpy0> on a test machine it doesn't work
[05:31:18] <Cork> lemonsparrow: $('br + br').after() ?
[05:31:22] <tpy0> in FF
[05:31:26] <tpy0> in chrome it always works
[05:31:41] <Cork> tpy0: sounds like it might be a race problwem
[05:31:43] <tpy0> just wondering if there is anything special about that code
[05:31:44] <Cork> *problem
[05:31:47] <tpy0> which I am missing
[05:31:53] <Cork> check so the selector actually matches
[05:31:59] <Cork> i suspect no
[05:32:10] <Cork> console.log(image.length) == 0
[05:32:11] <lemonsparrow> Cork: thanks buddy
[05:32:14] <Cork> np
[05:32:20] <tpy0> the image is returned
[05:32:24] <tpy0> i do 2 consoles
[05:32:38] <tpy0> one on image.width() the other on image.attr("data-width")
[05:32:43] <Cork> hmm
[05:32:47] <tpy0> the latter fails in the log, the prior returns
[05:33:04] <tpy0> so that should work, aye?
[05:33:10] <Cork> what is console.log($('[id="findMe"]').length) ?
[05:33:11] <tpy0> nothing weird about that code of mine?
[05:33:24] <tpy0> no ()?
[05:33:43] <Cork> run console.log($('[id="findMe"]').length) in the code
[05:34:06] <tpy0> yeah the actual code isn't quite like that
[05:34:13] <tpy0> as long as you think this _should_ work
[05:34:17] <Cork> either way run the selector
[05:34:18] <tpy0> then that's enough for me
[05:34:30] <Cork> i need to know the number of id's matching your id
[05:34:38] <fabioportieri> why not $("#findMe") ?
[05:34:51] <Cork> fabioportieri: cause that is pointless for .length
[05:35:02] <Cork> as that is what i'm trying to check
[05:35:34] <interop_madness> thanks Cork
[05:35:41] <tpy0> sorry for implending flood
[05:35:43] <tpy0> jQuery('div.cycle-gallery .slide').each(function() {
[05:35:43] <tpy0> 		var holder = jQuery(this);
[05:35:43] <tpy0> 		var image = holder.find('img');
[05:35:48] <tpy0> its actually that
[05:35:53] <interop_madness> another question: is there any way to get a correct outerWidth() of an svg element?
[05:35:55] <Cork> don't paste in the channel
[05:36:06] <Cork> fabioportieri: http://jsfiddle.net/d5FeL/
[05:36:40] <fabioportieri> Cork: ah, i see.. kinda make sense
[05:36:43] <Cork> interop_madness: the actually <svg> on an svg type element?
[05:36:45] <fabioportieri> since id are supposed to be unique
[05:36:49] <Cork> like g or similar
[05:36:52] <Cork> ya
[05:37:05] <Cork> so my check was to see if the html was valid
[05:37:07] <interop_madness> Cork, specifically, a <text> inside an <svg>
[05:37:10] <b-ot> interop_madness: No output.
[05:37:19] <Cork> interop_madness: that is harder
[05:37:29] <Cork> uh... what?
[05:37:39] <Cork> b-ot: are you mad?
[05:37:39] <b-ot> Cork: don’t count on it.
[05:38:29] <Cork> interop_madness: the big problem is that svg elements doesn't have to have a width
[05:38:56] <Cork> and i'm not sure if <text> has one
[05:38:59] <interop_madness> Cork, it's an svg element i created earlier though
[05:39:05] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[05:39:05] <interop_madness> ok
[05:39:09] <Cork> might be inline like <span> and no
[05:39:10] <Cork> O_o
[05:39:15] <Cork> <text>
[05:39:56] <Cork> and inline elements don't have width
[05:39:56] <interop_madness> it seems elem[0].getBoundingClientRect().width does the trick
[05:40:14] <interop_madness> sure seems ugly, but since jquery has no support for svg...
[05:40:18] <Cork> interop_madness: then elm.width() should work
[05:40:48] <Cork> interop_madness: well it does acutally
[05:40:48] <interop_madness> Cork,  nope, this returns 0
[05:40:57] <Cork> jquery has support for dom any dom
[05:41:06] <Cork> as the browser only have one
[05:41:29] <interop_madness> Cork, it doesn't seem like this. for instance, i had to use a helper function, which calls document.createElementNS() with the svg namespace
[05:41:31] <Cork> if elements don't behave like normal elements those elements might need to have special cases
[05:41:43] <Cork> uh
[05:41:51] <interop_madness> otherwise the stuff is added to the dom, but the browser refuses rendering and it's gray in firebug
[05:41:54] <Cork> i create svg elements with straight jquery just fine
[05:42:29] <interop_madness> Cork, do you create the <svg> as well?
[05:42:37] <Cork> no
[05:42:46] <interop_madness> i do that, an it seems therein lies the problem
[05:42:48] <Cork> i add and modify the original svg
[05:42:53] <Cork> possibly
[05:42:57] <Cork> haven't tried that
[05:51:12] <Uhkis> MacroMan: i think Cork knows more about the bot
[05:54:55] <TheJHNZ> can you send files through ajax?
[05:56:38] <fabioportieri> not crossbrowser
[05:59:28] <seismo> hi there
[06:00:06] <seismo> is there a way with jquery to trigger a function once all images of an element are loaded?
[06:00:32] <fabioportieri> you have to preload the image first i suppose
[06:03:06] <Cork> seismo: you can bind load event listeners to the img tags before you add them to the page
[06:03:17] <Cork> it only works if you add the images dynamically though
[06:03:32] <Cork> (load on the document would work for initial load)
[06:03:45] <seismo> ok. then i'd know when every single image has been loaded. but when do i know if all images inside an element are done loading?
[06:04:03] <fabioportieri> you can check with .complete
[06:04:08] <seismo> the images are inside a display:hidden div
[06:04:22] <seismo> thats why they won't be preloaded
[06:04:48] <seismo> now when a user expands the div i have to wait until the images are there so i can make a slider out of them
[06:06:57] <seismo> is that possible somehow?
[06:07:45] <Cork> seismo: browsers normally don't load images that isn't visible now days
[06:07:56] <seismo> yes sure
[06:07:57] <Cork> you can preload them
[06:08:07] <seismo> but they do load them once they should be visible
[06:08:07] <Cork> but that will only get it to the cache
[06:08:15] <Cork> the rendering will still be the same
[06:08:23] <seismo> once the user expands the hidden div (making it visible)
[06:08:30] <Cork> seismo: you most likely see the rendering time
[06:08:36] <Cork> and no there is no way to get around that
[06:08:53] <seismo> see the rendering time?
[06:09:08] <Cork> when the browsers see a link to an image
[06:09:16] <fabioportieri> seismo: maybe that helps http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2832953/jquery-check-when-image-is-loaded
[06:09:17] <Cork> it downloads an image to the browser cache
[06:09:27] <Cork> when it later needs to render it (so you can see it)
[06:09:33] <Cork> it will decode the file
[06:09:39] <Cork> and then render it to the page
[06:11:31] <seismo> fabioportieri: that looks good
[06:11:39] <seismo> imma try playing around with that :) thanks very much
[06:11:58] <seismo> and thanks Cork for the explanation. thats good to know
[06:16:58] <sess> With jquery ui Dialog using width: auto - is there any way to account for a possible vertical scrollbar?
[06:17:35] <sess> as soon as a vertical scrollbar is used due to long content, a horizontal scrollbar appears just to enable the extra width to fit the vertical one
[06:17:41] <sess> rendering the auto option useless
[06:26:38] <Somatt_wrk_> hi
[06:27:01] <Somatt_wrk_> is there a restriction preventing us from animating max-height with jquery animate()? it doesn't seem to be working
[06:27:31] <Cork> Somatt_wrk_: i'm quite sure it works
[06:27:42] <Cork> as long as you don't use something that tries to do it in css3
[06:27:55] <Cork> cause it can't do max-height animation (or max-width)
[06:28:37] <Somatt_wrk_> I'm using .animate() so I guess I'm safe on that side
[06:30:44] <Cork> Somatt_wrk_: btw what are you animating to/from?
[06:31:15] <Cork> Somatt_wrk_: cause if you animate from auto; then ya that doesn't work without help
[06:32:21] <Somatt_wrk_> Cork: I'm setting a 0 value first through .css(), but I'm wondering if jquery can handle both in the same layout
[06:33:04] <Cork> .css('max-height', 0).animate({ 'max-height': 200 }, 5000) should work ya
[06:38:45] <mehwork> in jquery-mobile how come when i do $('#myCollapsible'.on('expand', function(e){ (this).children().next().slideToggle("slow"); } }); it expands unanimated and then immediately collapses animated?
[06:38:54] <mehwork> i just want it to expand animated
[06:39:16] <sess> nevermind my dialog question - it was the width 100% of the content that broke it
[06:39:40] <sess> cant imagine why datatables would have width 100% as default as it makes explicit column widths a joke
[06:40:09] <mehwork> and if i change it to $(this).children().next().slideDown("slow"); it just expands without animation
[06:41:28] <sacrebleu> in a .change(function()) .. how to inspect event for value of select? .. or do I $("#selector").get(0).value?
[06:42:34] <sess> try $('this')
[06:42:42] <sess> try $(this)*
[06:46:03] <BillCriswell> sacrebleu: $(this).val() inside the change callback. SHould probably be using $('select').on('change', function(){ console.log( $(this).val() ); });
[06:47:29] <BillCriswell> sacrebleu: this.value would also work, doing $('#selector').get(0).value is just doing this.value for the most part.
[06:48:58] <mehwork> one of these years i'll ask a question that gets answered :D
[06:49:12] <mehwork> i'm like 0/1,248
[06:50:59] <NiluxonCw> hello
[06:51:44] <BillCriswell> mehwork: $(this).children().next().slideToggle seems weird to me.
[06:51:46] <NiluxonCw> I wanna to know if I have some like - <a class='something' onclick('my_funtion()')>click here</a>
[06:52:05] <NiluxonCw> onlick='my_function()'*
[06:52:23] <NiluxonCw> inside my_function() I can to know the properties of that tag
[06:52:27] <NiluxonCw> for example the class
[06:52:42] <NiluxonCw> some like $(this).attr('class')
[06:52:46] <BillCriswell> mehwork: The .next() would choose the next element.. of the filter child maybe? Which would be the second element? What's your goal?
[06:52:51] <NiluxonCw> obviously like this dont
[06:53:34] <BillCriswell> NiluxonCw: That's how you'd do it. $('.something').on('click', function(){ alert( $(this).attr('class'); });
[06:53:56] <BillCriswell> Er. $('.something').on('click', function(){ alert( $(this).attr('class') ); });
[06:54:28] <NiluxonCw> BillCriswell : yes like that would can do it
[06:54:40] <NiluxonCw> but with the onclick event directly in the tag
[06:55:11] <NiluxonCw> for get the properties in the function
[06:57:02] <BillCriswell> NiluxonCw: You would have to do like onclick="foo(this)", but if you have access to edit the onclick attribute why don't you just do it the right wya?
[06:58:27] <NiluxonCw> BillCriswell : ok
[07:06:26] <sess> is it bad practice to create html strings using $(htmlText) and chaining to add things?
[07:06:47] <sess> say I want to create a html string with an anchor with css, I could $('<a></a>').css(...)
[07:07:02] <sess> creates clean code, but i'm not sure if performance or side effects
[07:07:42] <fabioportieri> sess: maybe you should do with templating
[07:07:47] <wunz> that doesn't give you an html string... that's applying css towards that selector
[07:08:10] <sess> $(html) creates a dom element, I can't imagine it would be hard to get a string from it
[07:08:24] <sess> fabioportieri: templating feels overkill, this is small one-off things
[07:09:03] <sess> creating html with attributes in strings is just so horrible I'd like to find something smoother without introducing more libraries
[07:12:31] <mehwork> BillCriswell: well it seems to be selecting what i want it to, but my problem is that slideToggle() is opening and closing the menu rather than just opening it
[07:13:41] <BillCriswell> Is it doing it to the top one?
[07:13:45] <BillCriswell> or first one.
[07:14:42] <mehwork> BillCriswell: the first/rest
[07:15:04] <mehwork> if i take out the .next it will open and then close all of them including the heading
[07:15:23] <mehwork> and if i change it to .slideDown() it opens the menu like i want but without an animation, which makes absolutely no sense
[07:15:44] <BillCriswell> mehwork: You should set up a demo somewhere.
[07:19:53] <mehwork> BillCriswell: it'd be impossible with my app, but there are jsFiddles that exist that do the same thing supposedly and work fine
[07:21:59] <BillCriswell> mehwork: Not sure I'd be able to help in the dark.
[07:25:02] <mehwork> BillCriswell: it's ok thanks for trying. I was mostly curious if anyone knew why slideToggle would open and close a menu at the same time rather than just open it
[07:25:17] <BillCriswell> mehwork: I think you're just running it twice.
[07:25:40] <BillCriswell> Try adding return false to the function that's calling slide toggle.
[07:29:18] <iSDP> is it possible to create a table from json data?
[07:29:50] <iSDP> i want to load items from a db dynamically via jQuery, as i want to be able to edit everything on one page...
[07:30:33] <BillCriswell> iSDP: You'd loop through each item and append it to the table.
[07:31:35] <BillCriswell> iSDP: http://stackoverflow.com/a/10301494/191226
[07:31:36] <sess> also most table plugins have json support
[07:31:46] <sess> and i hate them all :v
[07:32:43] <BillCriswell> Haha I haven't used one.
[07:34:03] <clime> anyone familiar with magnific popup plugin. I need help with one failry complicated thing: dynamically adding items from html to an open popup.
[07:36:48] <Nephro> can I pass a serialized array to a $.post function?
[07:37:03] <Nephro> will it handle a serialized array properly?
[07:37:12] <BillCriswell> Nephro: Yeah.
[07:46:30] <pachet> dear jquery
[07:46:44] <pachet> who was it that made $.ajax expect a 'type' property in place of 'method'
[07:46:48] <pachet> sincerely, pachet
[07:50:38] <mehwork> BillCriswell: i thought that true and had a return false already
[07:50:56] <mehwork> BillCriswell: it has to be something similar though, just can't figure out what it is
[08:01:12] <BillCriswell> Icon Fonts are stupid.
[08:02:25] <decx> svg guy?
[08:02:46] <mehwork> BillCriswell: curious why you say that
[08:04:31] <decx> i need a single printer icon, better include all gylphicons
[08:08:33] <Ualidus> hi everyone :)
[08:11:43] <Ualidus> I have a bug with jquery but I don't see any what to search in engines... When I have a long dialog box with input inside, when the dialog looses focus (if user search via CTRL + F for some informations), if the user click on the dialog it automatically focus the first input... I don't know if it's doing this on other browsers, occurs in Firefox with jquery 1.7.2 and ui 1.10.0
[08:12:27] <Ualidus> I wonder if there is a fix for it or must I upgrade jquery ? the few informations I saw on the net seems to say the bug is closed :o
[08:14:31] <BillCriswell> decx, mehwork: Just so many little inconsistencies between browsers / os.
[08:14:51] <Ualidus> (should I use jqueryui-dev chan ? ^^' don't know if theses channels are for developpers OF jquery or developpers USING jquery :p)
[08:18:51] <BillCriswell> Ualidus: This is where most people go for general help as far as I know
[08:19:37] <Ualidus> ok so I'll ask my question there too =] thank you
[08:20:00] <decx> i don't know what you mean anyway
[08:20:14] <ctc> hey
[08:21:19] <ctc> I have problems with slow (1-2seconds) checkboxes "click" on a page with many (>1000) checkboxes and jquery loaded, but also slow when all jquery click events are disabled
[08:26:22] <BillCriswell> ctc: Not sure how to avoid a delay with that many checkboxes?
[08:26:43] <decx> i think that'll slow down even without any added jquery
[08:28:28] <clime> anyone familiar with magnific popup? I need some help with dynamic items update.
[08:30:20] <ctc> BillCriswell: someone mentioned that disabling jquery checkbox handler helped and using a own one: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/clicking-a-checkbox-very-slow-when-there-are-many-checkboxes
[08:30:37] <NoiseEee> ctc: honestly, your first problem is 1000 checkboxes on a page, complete balderdash.
[08:31:37] <ctc> NoiseEee: ideas welcome...
[08:31:38] <BillCriswell> ctc: It seems like trying to get "this" is really slow. http://jsbin.com/dafu/2/edit?html,js,output "n" outputs fine, but "this" takes a while. I agree with NoiseEee over all though.
[08:31:46] <NoiseEee> ctc: UI design?
[08:32:06] <NoiseEee> *why* are there 1000 checkboxes?
[08:32:18] <ctc> NoiseEee: because we avoided pageing
[08:32:28] <NoiseEee> hows that tradeoff goin
[08:32:33] <NoiseEee> j/k lol not really
[08:32:44] <NoiseEee> ctc: no human can make sense of 1000 checkboxes on a page.
[08:32:47] <ctc> I have x rows with y columns, and with the check-boxes I switch "tasks" on an off
[08:33:47] <ctc> NoiseEee: it works well and looks great and clearly arranged
[08:34:45] <NoiseEee> ctc: then accept that putting 1,000 checkboxes on a page will take time to do things with
[08:36:11] <jax> hello
[08:36:35] <Whiskey> jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/VRbL5/ how can i whit jQuery find the side whit most spaces in "dataViewBox-Data", and add it to right side to every span in that class automatic?
[08:37:09] <dmfalke> ctc: i suspect your issue is related to how you're registering click event handlers
[08:37:42] <dmfalke> ctc: do you have a sample available anywhere?
[08:37:49] <ctc> dmfalke: no, it's the problem thats the click is slow, even also when only jquery is loaded and nothing else
[08:37:56] <jax> anybody have a good solution for this: I got some nested tables, something like: Order -> Order Part -> Order Part Items and i have check boxes on all 3 levels, i.e one for Order, one for Part, one for the each item in the part. Now the values of the checkboxes should only reference the Order Part Items, i.e the most nested check boxes. But i would like to load the different levels of nested tables via ajax, so i don't have to pre-load the whole table (can be qu
[08:38:05] <ctc> jquery click ecents work well
[08:38:19] <dmfalke> ctc: what do you mean that the clicks are slow?
[08:38:37] <ctc> dmfalke: time between click and x appears
[08:38:48] <Ualidus> ok I got a solution, thanks anyway, bye :)
[08:39:12] <ska-fan> How do I do $(':not(.empty-form)') correctly?
[08:39:38] <Whiskey> no one?
[08:39:42] <dmfalke> ctc: just to make sure I'm clear, you mean that when you click on a checkbox, it takes about 2-3 secs for it to appear checked?
[08:39:43] <BillCriswell> ska-fan: I think that should work?
[08:39:54] <ctc> dmfalke: yes
[08:40:19] <dmfalke> ctc: and it's a native checkbox?
[08:40:30] <ctc> dmfalke: already deactivated all javasrcipt execpt jquery loading to make shure not a function of me makes it slow
[08:40:32] <decx> checkboxes just become slow when you have too many
[08:40:35] <BillCriswell> ctc: Are you logging anything large to console?
[08:40:35] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/S3dAe/
[08:40:38] <ska-fan> BillCriswell: I thought so too. I'll create a jsfiddle to demostrate
[08:41:00] <BillCriswell> ctc: http://jsbin.com/dafu/4/edit works quickly, but if I uncomment the console.log(this) line it's slow.
[08:41:08] <ctc> <input id_article="91771" task="2" class="articleTask nostyle" type="checkbox">
[08:41:45] <NoiseEee> ctc: fwiw, you should change those custom attributes to data attributes:  data-task="2"   data-idarticle="91771"
[08:41:48] <ctc> no, logging is disabled
[08:41:55] <NoiseEee> ctc: put up a fiddle
[08:42:05] <BillCriswell> I guess it's just accessing `this` that's slow.
[08:42:28] <dmfalke> decx: i don't think the total number of checkboxes will affect the performance of checking one
[08:42:33] <duch_kazatel> ctc you can't randomly add your your own attributes, btw.
[08:42:46] <decx> dmfalke i see a clear delay when i go from 20 to 1500
[08:43:04] <decx> regardless of any clickhandlers
[08:43:19] <BillCriswell> ctc: Is your console even open?
[08:44:01] <ctc> bill: no console open problem
[08:44:04] <decx> it probably just piles up even more if you put jquery in the mix
[08:44:39] <duch_kazatel> have we seen any code for this?
[08:44:46] <NoiseEee> i see no delay at all on that fiddle decx
[08:44:53] <NoiseEee> even when i add jquery to the mix
[08:45:19] <decx> i'm on an old system so believe me when i say there's a delay :D
[08:45:34] <NoiseEee> decx: well might i suggest a modern computer.
[08:45:51] <NoiseEee> fiddle works for everyone = end of story
[08:45:59] <decx> that's no way to treat a performance problem
[08:46:01] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/dafu/5/edit?html,js,output still feels pretty slow, if I'm doing it right.
[08:46:17] <NoiseEee> decx: you know that JS performance in that is computer dependent, right?
[08:46:18] <ctc> putting code to fiddle does not work well - to much dynamic loaded
[08:46:34] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell that has a delay for me, too.
[08:46:36] <NoiseEee> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/S3dAe/1/  zero problems.  good luck.
[08:47:19] <dmfalke> ctc: sry, connection dropped
[08:47:57] <duch_kazatel> http://jsbin.com/dafu/6/edit - this does not have any delay.
[08:48:00] <duch_kazatel> event delegation ftw.
[08:48:29] <decx> NoiseEee the point is, the delay until a box is checked goes from <20ms with 20 checkboxes to >20ms with 1000 checkboxes. and that's an indication that many checkboxes can slow down a page.
[08:48:57] <NoiseEee> decx: which goes back to my original point, that no single page/UI should display 1000 checkboxes.
[08:49:14] <decx> i'm not arguing that
[08:49:25] <decx> it'S ridiculous
[08:49:30] <ctc> posting the code on fiddle does not work well - there the css is missing and it's fast...
[08:49:34] <duch_kazatel> try to tell my company that :(
[08:50:05] <ctc> but will try the data attributes and also disable css to check if it helps
[08:50:28] <duch_kazatel> ctc you should use the data attributes anyway since custom ones are a no-no.
[08:50:35] <duch_kazatel> unless you know how to properly define them.
[08:53:02] <ctc> duch_kazatel: what do you mean with properly definition?
[08:53:20] <ska-fan> $(':not(.some-class') doesn't work as expected. Any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/Mcg3t/
[08:53:57] <duch_kazatel> ctc I wouldn't worry about it in your case.  just use data attribtues.
[08:54:00] <duch_kazatel> *attributes
[08:54:45] <decx> ska-fan blue overrised red
[08:54:47] <shoky> ska-fan:  $(':not(.empty) li')    means an <li>  that has SOME ancestor without the class .empty
[08:54:49] <decx> overrides
[08:54:59] <decx> no it's a css thing
[08:55:02] <shoky> so if the <li>  is under <body>  it will be matched
[08:55:25] <decx> check the class of the first uls li blue red italics bg
[08:55:51] <shoky> it could also be a css thing, not saying its just one problem ;p
[08:55:59] <decx> oh you'Re right it's both hehe
[08:56:12] <duch_kazatel> yeah - console.log($(':not(.empty) li')); shows results.
[08:56:27] <ska-fan> Ok, great, I see, thanks :) Now how do I express "all li except when they're in an element with class="empty"?
[08:57:25] <decx> you already did
[08:57:30] <duch_kazatel> your issue is CSS.
[08:58:48] <ska-fan> How? I cannot select the two li's in the middle.
[08:59:00] <shoky> ska-fan  http://jsfiddle.net/Mcg3t/1/
[09:00:09] <ska-fan> shoky: no selector there selects the middle two li's
[09:00:32] <duch_kazatel> so you want all LIs that are under "empty"?
[09:00:35] <duch_kazatel> really?
[09:00:46] <shoky> $('.empty > li')  ?
[09:00:50] <duch_kazatel> $('.empty li');
[09:00:54] <duch_kazatel> or Shoky's
[09:01:01] <decx> slo selectaaa
[09:01:22] <ska-fan> Ah, just a second
[09:02:02] <saml> $(foobar).insertAfter(something)   how do I do something after foobar gets inserted?
[09:02:12] <duch_kazatel> shoky if you want fast, $('.empty').children('li');
[09:02:22] <shoky> saml:  $(foobar).insertAfter(something);   doSomething()
[09:02:32] <shoky> duch it wasn't me complaining :P
[09:02:37] <saml> hrm. insertAfter()  is blocking?
[09:02:53] <shoky> saml: it blocks until the element is in the DOM, yes
[09:02:58] <saml> i want to do after DOM is updated completely
[09:03:04] <saml> ah thanks
[09:03:05] <shoky> what does "updated completely" mean
[09:03:09] <saml> i don't know
[09:03:13] <shoky> oks
[09:03:18] <duch_kazatel> dep, yeah you're right - decx if you want fast, $('.empty').children('li');
[09:03:33] <saml> i thought javascript is event driven  so I was thinking $(x).insertAfter(y).whenCompleted(function...)
[09:03:39] <decx> btw duch_kazatel i tested a bit, if you have flat structure with few elements then .find is faster than .children
[09:03:44] <duch_kazatel> truth.
[09:04:05] <shoky> saml:  insertAfter is not an async operation
[09:04:07] <decx> but with few elements the gains are marginal anyway
[09:04:21] <ska-fan> Okay, now the problem is that it's not an li that I want to match but an <input> and I don't know where it is in the hierarchy under the element without class empty.
[09:04:22] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[09:04:25] <shoky> saml: ajax and animations are async
[09:04:32] <saml> ah thanks
[09:04:44] <duch_kazatel> ska-fan you should go read about selectors.
[09:05:00] <duch_kazatel> ska-fan it would do you a ton of good here.
[09:05:39] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/VgBkd/39/ <--- try to find http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/VgBkd/40/ i try to find the side that start whit most matches, but it don´t work so good
[09:07:47] <ska-fan> http://jsfiddle.net/TBTFw/ How do I select just the bottom two spans?
[09:08:38] <ska-fan> duch_kazatel: Can you point me to what I'm missing? I understand why ':not(.empty) span' doesn't do what I want, but I don't know how to express what I want as a selector.
[09:08:42] <fabioportieri> bye
[09:09:54] <decx> ska-fan $(':not(.empty) span').slice(-2).addClass('red');
[09:10:13] <ska-fan> decx: haha :)
[09:10:32] <BillCriswell> Having to use a selector like that should set off some flags though!
[09:11:09] <ska-fan> I want the spans where none of their parents have class="empty".
[09:11:49] <duch_kazatel> why aren't you modifying your markup to make this a little easier?
[09:11:54] <NoiseEee> do they have a specific class or means of identification besides "not being empty"?
[09:11:58] <NoiseEee> what duch_kazatel said, basically.
[09:12:59] <duch_kazatel> this is a totally legit case to make your markup more meaningful.
[09:13:06] <ska-fan> NoiseEee: It's actually inputs that are not in a form template that is used to add now forms to a formset with JS. Now I don't want to initialize the datetimepicker on those inputs because that leads to errors when cloning the template.
[09:14:26] <Evil_Work> Does anyone know a way to get a debugger to stop when jquery adds something to an element to be fired on a click event?
[09:14:44] <farmdawgnation> Evil_Work: Chrome dev tools may allow you to do that.
[09:15:01] <farmdawgnation> I'm pretty sure they allow you to stop when the DOM changes.
[09:15:04] <Evil_Work> farmdawgnation: I've been trying that but I can't figure it out
[09:15:14] <Evil_Work> Oh DOM change.. ok
[09:15:32] <farmdawgnation> Yeah, don't know if that'll do exactly what you want or not.
[09:15:38] <farmdawgnation> But... maybe? :D
[09:15:45] <Evil_Work> hmm now how does one add a breakpoint in the DOM Breakpoints
[09:16:16] <farmdawgnation> From the element inspector you should be able to right click on a node and say "Break on.."
[09:17:28] <NoiseEee> but if you're asking how to get it to enter the debugger when a listener is added, i don't think thats possible
[09:19:13] <Whiskey> No one?
[09:20:47] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey i'm not going to work on a fiddle that has an ascii middle finger ;)
[09:23:11] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: don´t care about that, its the ascii that is the problem
[09:23:33] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey I'm at work.
[09:23:34] <Whiskey> i need to get out what has most space, and add it to the right side, to center it whatever that acii crap is
[09:23:54] <BillCriswell> lol
[09:24:02] <duch_kazatel> that's an easy task either way.
[09:26:16] <farmdawgnation> NoiseEee: I suppose you could -technically- hack $.fn.on, but that'd be all varieties of nasty. lololol.
[09:35:53] <momchillgorchev> Hello
[09:37:53] <InphraRed> hi
[09:39:54] <InphraRed> I have a jquery dialog box (jquery 1.9.1 I think), currently it's set to modal and movable.  Everything is fine, except however much the page is scrolled down, when you go to move the dialog box it will add the difference between your cursor and the dialog title bar
[09:40:19] <InphraRed> so if I'm scrolled down 10 pixels, on mousedown and move, the dialog box shifts 10 pixels below the cursor.
[09:40:23] <InphraRed> how can I fix this?
[09:44:36] <ctc> sorry for blameing jquery - finally it was a single css line: .ui-widget :active { outline: none; }
[09:44:49] <ctc> which made checkboxes slow..
[09:45:00] <BillCriswell> ctc: That's weird.
[09:45:05] <ctc> indeed
[09:45:07] <BillCriswell> But also kind of cool.
[09:45:27] <raj> css slowing down the webpage??
[09:45:28] <raj> wow
[09:46:13] <decx> i once had a sluggish scrolling page, turned out a parent element where border-radius is set gets slow when it has a few hundred children
[09:46:14] <raj> there's probably more to the story, where js is doing something off the css or whatever
[09:46:23] <ctc> checkbox "check" took 1-2 seconds with about 1000 checkboxes - and now - fast a hell
[09:46:31] <shoky> nah css is perfectly capable of slowing down pages on its own
[09:46:34] <ctc> perhaps
[09:46:40] <BillCriswell> Magic.
[09:46:42] <raj> good to know
[09:46:48] <ctc> but had no impact when we removed the line *g*
[09:46:49] <NoiseEee> indeed... screen repainting
[09:47:02] <shoky> see all those "jank busting" videos for details
[09:47:26] <BillCriswell> That's why I build websites like it's 2007.5
[09:47:37] <NoiseEee> <font> tags ftw
[09:47:38] <shoky> ;]
[09:47:49] <farmdawgnation> <blink>
[09:48:01] <decx> BillCriswell with dreamweaver? oh wait that was 1997 ;)
[09:48:15] <ctc> that was called "notepad"
[09:48:41] <BillCriswell> decx: I have to use dreamweaver on this project I'm working on. It makes things so much more complicated for me.
[09:48:59] <duch_kazatel> <marquee>
[09:49:16] <decx> yeah you already stated your plight, that's why the reference
[09:49:34] <BillCriswell> ='(
[09:49:42] <raj> shoky still uses <marquee>
[09:49:50] <farmdawgnation> duch_kazatel: You, too, like to live dangeriously.
[09:50:05] <farmdawgnation> Wow. My spelling is fantastic today.
[09:52:02] <BillCriswell> Spelling is overraided.
[09:52:27] <duch_kazatel> i rewrote marquee in javascript.
[09:52:29] <duch_kazatel> it was... different.
[09:52:37] <InphraRed> can someone help with my jquery dialog box jumping when I go to move it?
[09:53:23] <BillCriswell> InphraRed: You should set up a demo.
[09:53:24] <InphraRed> the exact number of pixels the page is scrolled off screen, is how far the dialog box will jump from the cursor when the user moves the dialog box giving the appearance that it drops
[09:53:30] <duch_kazatel> InphraRed folks are much more likely to help if you get a very small demo up and running.
[09:53:51] <InphraRed> it's the basic dialog box set to movable and modal
[09:54:03] <InphraRed> if the page is scrolled any, it will happen
[09:54:17] <duch_kazatel> cool - set up a sample on jsfiddle ;)
[09:54:18] <decx> we're all lazy here, give us a clickable link damnit
[09:54:18] <InphraRed> what's the site to do the examples and I'll try to set one up?
[09:54:58] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle
[09:55:12] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/qete/1/edit it has jQuery UI included ehre alredy.
[09:58:59] <shoky> you bet i still use <marquee>. it's the first thing i type in any comments section on someone's new website i'm testing. especially raj's
[09:59:05] <shoky> comments/chat
[09:59:38] <InphraRed> what do I have to do to get the jsfiddle to actually run the code?
[09:59:45] <duch_kazatel> save it.
[10:00:03] <shoky> running it is also worthwhile
[10:00:20] <BillCriswell> If I'm not mistaking there's a "Run" button at the top
[10:00:33] <InphraRed> duch-kazatel no no, it's not rendering correctly, I remember the last time I did this, I had to use a wierd syntax or something
[10:01:12] <shoky> browser is doing the rendering, not jsfiddle
[10:01:46] <duch_kazatel> InphraRed if it's not working right, then your code is wrong.
[10:01:51] <ctc> *fucking* bluescreen..
[10:02:50] <ska-fan> http://jsfiddle.net/zM86e/ How do I use the scope argument to init to append foo only to the newly added span?
[10:03:04] <ska-fan> Basically I need the intersection of two node sets.
[10:03:18] <InphraRed> duch_kazatel the code works just fine in the browser, well aside from the bug I mentioned.  it has to be written differently to put in jsfiddle
[10:05:34] <BillCriswell> ska-fan: Uhh.
[10:06:03] <duch_kazatel> InphraRed you should be writing a short, indicative example.  that's all.
[10:06:14] <InphraRed> duch it is
[10:06:27] <duch_kazatel> then link it?
[10:06:30] <InphraRed> it's quite simply the most basic jquery dialog sample one might make
[10:06:41] <duch_kazatel> if it's broken the same way, awesome.
[10:06:44] <InphraRed> well it's not working in jsfiddle, I always forget how to get things running with this site.
[10:06:59] <BillCriswell> InphraRed: https://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[10:07:29] <InphraRed> BillCriswell yes, I'm very familiar with that site.  It's where I learned to do the dialogs
[10:07:57] <BillCriswell> Are you experiencing the issue on these very basic demos?
[10:08:12] <decx> good lord, there http://jsfiddle.net/NPvfw/ start here and implement your problem to show us
[10:08:19] <InphraRed> the problem is, the jquery dialog box seems to ignore viewport and only considers pixel position based on the website itself, so if things are scrolled when moving the dialog box the cursor jumps
[10:08:48] <BillCriswell> It jumps to the cursor... right?
[10:08:55] <InphraRed> decx ok
[10:09:07] <InphraRed> no the dialog jumps away from the cursor
[10:09:27] <InphraRed> if you are scrolled 100px down, then trying to move the dialog box the box will jump 100px below the cursor
[10:10:03] <ska-fan> BillCriswell: Does that mean it's not easily possible? :)
[10:10:20] <BillCriswell> Should I be able to replicate this in the demos at https://jqueryui.com/dialog/ ?
[10:10:44] <decx> BillCriswell i figured it out, scroll down a bit and then grab the modal http://jsfiddle.net/decx/NPvfw/1/
[10:11:32] <decx> seems to be a bug
[10:12:05] <InphraRed> decx yes that's it
[10:12:08] <decx> good job InphraRed not giving up in spite of our ignorance ;)
[10:12:22] <InphraRed> I tried to modify your original post, but jsfiddle kept giving me some message about the window dimming
[10:13:44] <InphraRed> decx well, I'm not the brightest myself, I think I know what's going on, jquery isn't setting x/y position offsets based on viewport and actual site size.
[10:15:38] <repxl> how i can stop show search bar hints
[10:15:56] <Woet> i assume you need autocomplete="off" on the input field
[10:16:00] <Woet> not really related to jquery but okay
[10:16:09] <Woet> if that is not your question, please be more clear
[10:16:53] <repxl> Woet right thx you solved it .. y i didn't know it's html related
[10:17:07] <Woet> well jquery doesn't do anything unless you tell it to
[10:17:18] <Woet> so it won't auto complete input fields until you tell it to do so
[10:17:29] <repxl> Woet k
[10:18:02] <BillCriswell> InphraRed, decx: .ui-dialog { position: fixed; } will fix it somewhat?
[10:18:40] <decx> that's really just sidestepping the bug though
[10:18:59] <BillCriswell> You mistyped "Perfect Solution"
[10:19:18] <decx> well this is a javascript channel so i guess you're right ^^
[10:19:39] <BillCriswell> Maybe "infallible" as well.
[10:19:49] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[10:20:05] <decx> i like to add my own fixed class instead of writing over ui ones though
[10:20:25] <BillCriswell> You must prefer a more sane solution.
[10:20:25] <decx> option dialogClass: 'fixer'
[10:20:40] <duch_kazatel> same here
[10:21:28] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel, decx: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9315
[10:21:43] <decx> good
[10:21:47] <decx> it is known
[10:23:37] <BillCriswell> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LBPoxMnfzc I can't stop laughing at this. Seen it a million times, never stops making me laugh.
[10:25:10] <decx> these ghost hunter shows are already real life satire
[10:25:33] <BillCriswell> decx: Agreed.
[10:25:49] <BillCriswell> I wish I believed that shit. It would be so fun.
[10:26:43] <decx> any unconditional believe can be comforting
[10:27:10] <decx> i'm getting philosophical here, time for a break
[10:28:17] <BillCriswell> Haha
[10:30:48] <InphraRed> BillCriswell thanks for that bugs link, it's been closed and incorrectly asserts it's only with UI 1.10.3  I'm using 1.9.x and I see it.
[10:31:28] <InphraRed> no no... the jquery-ui I'm using is 1.10.3.... so I should downgrade to 1.10.2
[10:33:19] <sree> hey ppl can anyone resolve this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21609967/expand-a-single-row-into-a-table
[10:34:12] <InphraRed> Bill has that bug been fixed for ui 1.10.4?
[10:34:31] <duch_kazatel> sree what's your question, exactly?
[10:35:44] <sree> if i click a row in a table it needs to expand and show a table how do this
[10:35:57] <sree> duch_kazatel
[10:36:13] <duch_kazatel> sree you bind an event handler for clicks.
[10:36:20] <duch_kazatel> baby steps.
[10:36:29] <duch_kazatel> learn how to bind event handlers
[10:36:36] <sree> i am new to all of this
[10:36:41] <sree> okay
[10:36:48] <BillCriswell> InphraRed: I'd try it and see.
[10:45:02] <InphraRed> Bill the bug exists in 1.10.4 ui
[10:45:17] <InphraRed> I just downgraded to 1.10.2 and the bug is now gone
[10:46:06] <BillCriswell> Sweeeeeet.
[10:47:01] <wk-work_> $( ".dropdown li" ).addClass( "active" ); <- is there anything wrong with this? I'm trying to add "active" to a li with the class "dropdown"
[10:47:08] <wk-work_> (Literally never used jquery before)
[10:47:43] <InphraRed> Thanks guys for your help!  There's nothing more stopping me from world domination!
[10:48:34] <decx> hello herr bond, i will take over the world by having an auto opened modal box without a close button. niahahaha
[10:49:12] <duch_kazatel> decx no, instead you set the modal to move whenever your mouse gets close to the close button
[10:50:28] <decx> well jokes on you, herr bond is using keyboard navigation and just tabs until the button is in focus
[10:51:43] <duch_kazatel> what herr bond doesn't know is that the reset styles disable the ability to see what the tab is currently on.
[10:51:56] <decx> no, not * { outline: 0 }, my one weakness
[10:52:03] <duch_kazatel> :(
[10:52:05] <duch_kazatel> the wors thing ever
[10:54:55] <wk-work_> hmm, can anyone help me? I'm trying to add the class "active" to a li with the class "dropdown"
[10:55:02] <jlucas> wk-work_ try this  $( "li.dropdown" ).each(function(e) { $(this).addClass( "active" ) })
[10:55:29] <decx> fyi you don't need each to add it to all of them
[10:55:48] <grafi> womp womp
[10:55:53] <wk-work_> jlucas: that seemed to have fixed it, thanks.. what did i do wrong ?
[10:56:19] <wk-work_> jlucas: actually it didnt work
[10:56:48] <jlucas> wk-work_ your selector was backwards
[10:57:10] <jlucas> wk-work_  you can try this as decx has pointed out   $("li.dropdown").addClass('active');
[10:57:55] <jlucas> if the class is assigned to the li element, then you had it looking for all li elements that were a child of an element that had a class of dropdown
[10:59:02] <wk-work_> hmm still doesnt work, wth
[10:59:47] <InphraRed> wait
[11:01:09] <NBhosting> is there a way to test javascript for crossbrowser issues
[11:01:32] <NBhosting> javascript/jquery
[11:02:44] <NoiseEee> NBhosting: in general, jquery is there to solve cross-browser issues.
[11:02:49] <NoiseEee> NBhosting: test in different browsers.
[11:03:13] <NBhosting> k would be nice if fiddle could check stuff like that
[11:03:20] <NBhosting> im stil lmixing javascript with jquery alot
[11:03:59] <grafi> almost like jquery is javascript :O
[11:05:01] <aljosa> if jquery is loaded in footer how can i get "$(document).ready()" to work inlined before jquery script tag?
[11:07:09] <nhqe> um, don't use inline jQuery
[11:10:25] <f0ster> is there anyway i can do an ajax prefilter to make sure all my ajax call routes have endslashes ?
[11:11:48] <BillCriswell> f0ster: beforeSend() might be able to help
[11:12:10] <f0ster> BillCriswell: thanks
[11:12:51] <f0ster> i dont want to change it on every ajax call, i want to do something globally that will catch it
[11:13:20] <BillCriswell> jQuery.ajaxSetup({ beforeSend: function( jqXHR, settings ){ console.log( jqXHR, settings ); }); should get you going.
[11:17:28] <ionico> hi to all
[11:18:08] <duch_kazatel> I HATE COLDFUSION SO MUCH.  <- and thus ends my daily griping.
[11:20:07] <BillCriswell> I hate Dreamweaver and the internet!
[11:20:18] <duch_kazatel> basically: all old macromedia products.
[11:23:07] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Good point.
[11:28:54] <grafi> macromedia is awesome guys
[11:29:00] <grafi> idk what you are talking about
[11:29:09] <duch_kazatel> :(
[11:29:15] <grafi> :D
[11:29:39] <grafi> anyone ever "compressed" an array of integers?
[11:29:53] <grafi> like turn [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] into ["1-7"] ?
[11:30:07] <grafi> i have an abomination that seemingly works
[11:30:14] <grafi> but its ugly as fuck
[11:30:19] <grafi> not elegant at all :P
[11:30:45] <Velveeta> is this an abomination you concocted, or one you were stuck with?
[11:30:54] <grafi> i just made it up
[11:30:55] <grafi> :P
[11:31:04] <Velveeta> bad grafi <smacks hand> bad!
[11:31:08] <grafi> well
[11:31:16] * Velveeta rubs grafi's nose in the array.
[11:31:25] <grafi> dont tell me what i already know
[11:31:30] <Velveeta> heheheh
[11:31:30] <grafi> tell me how to do it better ^^
[11:31:50] <Velveeta> why would you want to compress that in the first place, would be my question
[11:32:24] <grafi> i have a pastebin type of thing where you can highglight certain lines
[11:32:39] <murph> Is there a way to locate which elements are ontop of another element? Like I have A which covers B. If someone actually clicked with a mouse, they'd be clicking on A. But I only have a selector for B, and doing B.click() just clicks B under it.
[11:32:52] <grafi> now if I highlight a block of lines the url gets bigger and bigger
[11:33:04] <grafi> when i just need start and endline basically
[11:33:34] <Velveeta> then why use an array of lines as opposed to an object with a start and end property?
[11:34:04] <Velveeta> murph: as far as i know, there's no easy way to bind object zindex overlap relationships
[11:34:19] <grafi> hm
[11:34:25] <Velveeta> you'd have to do it manually by calculating the mouse coordinates and determining if they fall within B
[11:34:25] <murph> Is there a way to like .. get the (x,y) of an object, then simulate a click by (x,y) instead?
[11:34:48] <grafi> its an array because that probably easier to maintain ... at least thats what i think :p
[11:35:17] <Velveeta> you can generate a click event through $.Event('click'), and then set its x/y data properties, and then call trigger on your target element and pass that event in place of the word 'click'
[11:35:21] <grafi> just do .indexOf(lines) see where you have to remove line
[11:35:24] <grafi> and stuff
[11:35:34] <grafi> if those where objects
[11:35:43] <grafi> that stuff would a break
[11:35:45] <murph> Velveeta: okay, but that requires I know the target element already, right? :( this wont' work for my situation.
[11:36:06] <Velveeta> grafi: but if you're trying to collapse those into a range value, you'd lose the ability to do an indexOf against it anyway...
[11:36:12] <Velveeta> murph:  yup
[11:36:22] <grafi> im collapsing it to put it in the url
[11:36:38] <Velveeta> oh ok, well that's different
[11:36:50] <grafi> people can go around hading urls out like paste.com/#1-7,12,20-24
[11:37:00] <grafi> instead of #1,2,3,4,5,6,7,12,20,21,22,23,24
[11:37:04] <Velveeta> right
[11:37:13] <alanlke> hi, the rails foks sent me over here... I'm having trouble with select2, it fails when I try to do anything but just call ('#id').select2() ... i can't use arguments... https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8851037
[11:37:19] <Velveeta> i thought you were just collapsing to shave bytes off your memory footprint or something
[11:37:23] <grafi> nono
[11:38:15] <grafi> im not even sure what that stuff is called though ... no idea how to search a smarter algorithm than mine :P
[11:38:19] <Velveeta> murph: the only way to do something like that without knowing the underlying elements in advance would be to iterate over all of your elements and find the ones with an offset + width/height that surrounded those x/y coordinates
[11:38:26] <Velveeta> and that would be hellaciously expensive
[11:39:05] <murph> I'm okay with that. Last time I tried mucking with offset it went poorly, however. I'll see if it works here
[11:39:11] <Velveeta> grafi: i would probably search on something like "transport url range of values collapsed" or something like that
[11:39:12] <duch_kazatel> murph why are you targeting click by x,y ?
[11:39:43] <grafi> Velveeta ill be sure to add "or something" to the google query :D
[11:40:01] <Velveeta> duch_kazatel: he has elements overlaying other elements, and he wants a generic way of catching the click on the top-level zindex, and then funneling that click through to elements it's overlapping, without knowledge of what elements those might be
[11:40:11] <Velveeta> grafi: definitely, those are the magic words
[11:40:14] <murph> exactly.
[11:40:38] <duch_kazatel> grafi http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2270910/how-to-convert-sequence-of-numbers-in-an-array-to-range-of-numbers
[11:40:56] <Velveeta> there we go
[11:41:00] <duch_kazatel> specifically stackoverflow.com/questions/2270910/how-to-convert-sequence-of-numbers-in-an-array-to-range-of-numbers#answer-2270987
[11:41:07] <duch_kazatel> oh...
[11:41:08] <murph> I'm writing a chrome extension which injects things into other websites. So I have a lot of odd constraints, i'm just just trying to be completly backwards about how i work :)
[11:41:22] <murph> *not just
[11:42:33] <duch_kazatel> murph have you tried using pointer-events: none;?
[11:42:42] <Velveeta> so i'm in the middle of an ambitious project of my own making… tearing jquery ui a new asshole in the guise of bringing it up to date with animation frames and promise functional returns, for our own internal widget library
[11:43:34] <duch_kazatel> murph check this out: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events
[11:43:52] <grafi> life saver duch_kazatel :D
[11:44:12] <Velveeta> and at the same time, i have to add a legacymode option for our consumers, so they can continue to update our product in their own products, without breaking their entire application or being forced to refactor to comply w/ the new interface
[11:44:45] <Velveeta> fun, fun stuff, i'm writing a new blog article about it as i go, maybe the ui team will take some of these ideas and incorporate them officially
[11:46:51] <duch_kazatel> murph did you look at that MDN article?
[11:47:45] <decx> where can i keep up with this blog Velveeta
[11:47:53] <decx> sounds great
[11:48:23] <murph> duch_kazatel: yeah. I don't think it helps, but it's an interesting article. I'll try to explain better
[11:48:33] <Velveeta> decx: this particular article is gonna be published in 1 big chunk, but if you wanna see the content other stuff up there, i can IM you the link
[11:48:37] <duch_kazatel> murphy you want to "click through" an overlay, right?
[11:48:52] <duch_kazatel> err, murph
[11:48:53] <murph> No, I want to click the overlay, but I have a reference to the thing under it
[11:49:10] <BillCriswell> ='(
[11:49:14] <alanlke> Hello (one repeat and then I won't spam this again) I'm having trouble with select2, it fails when I try to do anything but just call ('#id').select2() ... i can't use arguments... https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8851037
[11:49:36] <murph> I've got a <input> (of type password) that's hidden by some other element (usually a div or an image) that displays like a 'type password here' message. I want to click that overlay, which usually causes it to hide itself. I don't have a reliable selector for the overlay, though.
[11:49:39] <Velveeta> alanlke: sorry, i did see you the first time you posted, but i have no experience s/ the select2 plugin myself
[11:50:02] <Velveeta> i can take a quick look at it though, and see if i can spot anything obvious
[11:50:16] <Velveeta> oh yeah, there's your problem
[11:50:18] <duch_kazatel> murph i'm not understanding something here.
[11:50:18] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[11:50:31] <wunz> decx / duch_kazatel : would you recommend underscore or handlebars for templating?
[11:50:35] <decx> sure send it over Velveeta
[11:50:46] * Velveeta stands up straight and smacks his head on the hood of alanlke's code, showing him a bent-up piece of tubing.
[11:51:19] <Velveeta> you're passing those parameters wrong, they need to be wrapped in a set of curly braces also
[11:51:24] <BillCriswell> It's all tubes Velveeta.
[11:51:51] <Velveeta> at least i think… if that's ruby syntax, i notice a distinct lack of any commas
[11:52:11] <duch_kazatel> wunz it depends.  i'd suggest underscore's if you're all ready using underscore for other stuff.  if not, i'd look at john resig's microtemplating engine, but it totally depends.
[11:52:11] <Velveeta> so there's some kind of syntax massaging going on between that and javascript, i'd need to see the actual compiled javascript
[11:52:49] <murph> duch_kazatel: I'm writing a password manager. If you goto a site like.. https://bugs.kde.org/ and click login, you'll see that the actualy password box is hidden and there is a fake one displayed with the grey text "password". I have a selector for the password box (say input[type=password]). A user would usually click at it, which would hit the fake one and cause it to hide itself / the real one would show itself. I'm trying to simulate
[11:52:49] <murph> that reliably
[11:52:50] <Whiskey> whats wrong on this one, return $(this).text()[0].length;
[11:53:10] <wunz> yea i was using john's microtemplating engine suggested by decx yesterday until i bumped into underscore and handlebar
[11:53:31] <wunz> according performance from a site, says handlebar.js is faster
[11:53:35] * murph uses dustjs for client-side templating. idk if that's common, though.
[11:54:16] <alanlke> velveeta thank you ... let me grab it
[11:54:18] <Velveeta> whiskey: it would help if we knew what you were trying to accomplish w/ that statement
[11:54:46] <Whiskey> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/VRbL5/13/
[11:54:50] <Velveeta> i don't know how common dustjs is, but i do know *of* it.. i use handlebars myself
[11:55:00] <alanlke> velveeta:  here's the whole application.js https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8851406
[11:55:47] <decx> wunz well you didn't want to use a full templating engine yesterday so i just linked the simplest one i knew of ;) you really just have to try out the different options and see what fits you and the projects you want to do best
[11:55:57] <Velveeta> whiskey: that still doesn't tell me what you're trying to accomplish… i don't even see .text() in that page anywhere
[11:56:17] <Whiskey> Velveeta: its in the children.map(function () { i try to do it
[11:56:23] <Whiskey> just get the element whit biggest length
[11:56:56] <Velveeta> alanlke: well, that looks syntactically correct there.. what's it doing when you try?
[11:58:09] <Whiskey> i gives me, -Infinity¨
[11:58:37] <alanlke> velveeta, if I put just   $('#docket_tag_ids').select2()  ... it loads the code and i get a pretty select2 box
[11:58:46] <alanlke> if I add any arguments (like in the gist) it just fails to load select2
[11:58:59] <alanlke> ...then I just get the standard html form select list
[11:59:26] <alanlke> oh shit, snow... if I don't leave now i'm stuck, sorry!
[11:59:30] <alanlke> thank you
[12:01:56] <Velveeta> whiskey: so, i see you're grabbing each of those child spans, and you're iterating over then w/ map and returning this.length, are you trying to get a sum of the length of each one, or an array of lengths of each line, or filter the list down to just those lines that have a non-zero length, or what?
[12:02:08] <Velveeta> that's er, there it is, the element w/ the biggest length, ok
[12:02:12] <Velveeta> let me look back at it
[12:05:28] <Velveeta> whiskey: ok, i found your problem, your selector was typo'd
[12:05:54] <Velveeta> you have an extra 'a', $(".dataViewBox-Dataa") instead of $(".dataViewBox-Data")
[12:08:28] <Whiskey> yeh
[12:08:30] <Whiskey> i know :)
[12:08:33] <Whiskey> so stupid :D
[12:08:53] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/VRbL5/15/ here is where i am know Velveeta: i try to make so every span have same width
[12:09:04] <Whiskey> or length, but something is wrong when i try to add it
[12:11:00] <Velveeta> your line lengths are fine, the problem is that you're using a text-align: center in your css for it
[12:11:20] <Whiskey> Wee http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/VRbL5/16/ :D
[12:11:22] <Velveeta> you probably want to wrap that inside of a div or something, with left-aligned text, and then make the div itself centered
[12:11:30] <Velveeta> there you go
[12:11:32] <Whiskey> :)
[12:12:20] <Whiskey> Velveeta: thx for the help time for me to go :D
[12:12:25] <Velveeta> no problem
[12:17:22] <torbjorn> how can I search for a specific element in a selection?
[12:18:40] <duch_kazatel> torbjorn mind clarifying?
[12:19:04] <torbjorn> i have a search result, which contains a number of elements. i want to apply a selector on this selection
[12:19:54] <duch_kazatel> $('#parent #child');
[12:19:59] <andrewdex> #jquery
[12:20:00] <duch_kazatel> have some example html?
[12:20:02] <t0astt> If I am going to be implementing paging via AJAX in an application using PHP, jQuery, and MySQL, what language should I be using to keep track of which records should be pulled next on a new page? For example, say the first page has 15 records. Clicking the next page button would show the next 15 records from a given query against the database.
[12:20:48] <duch_kazatel> t0astt depends.  are you planning on allowing users to link to a given page?
[12:20:54] <andrewdex> hey everyone
[12:21:03] <torbjorn> so $(foo).find("#parent #child <my intended selector here>") ?
[12:21:09] <t0astt> duch_kazatel: I don't think I will have a need for doing that
[12:21:15] <t0astt> so no
[12:21:17] <duch_kazatel> torbjorn sure, that can work.
[12:21:36] <duch_kazatel> t0astt I'd do it via a session in PHP then.
[12:21:58] <duch_kazatel> torbjorn rather, $(foo).find("intendedSelectorHere") should work.
[12:22:23] <t0astt> Ok, and then would I be changing that session variable via AJAX then? And the SQL query would be adjusted (which records to pull) based on that session variable?
[12:23:26] <duch_kazatel> t0astt have you worked with sessions before?
[12:23:28] <torbjorn> didn't seem to work here, but i changed it already, merging the 2nd selector with the first
[12:23:38] <duch_kazatel> torbjorn have some example html?
[12:24:09] <t0astt> duch_kazatel yes I have, and I have worked with AJAX before, but never with implementing paging
[12:24:12] <duch_kazatel> torbjorn if you could paste a sample over at jsfiddle that would be helpful.
[12:24:31] <t0astt> duch_kazatel and that's why I'm sorta confused, I'm just not really sure what the most efficient way to implement it would be
[12:24:35] <duch_kazatel> t0astt all right, then yeah, let PHP track and update however you'd like using AJAX.
[12:24:39] <torbjorn> "your paste triggered our spam filter and has been dropped"
[12:24:48] <t0astt> duch_kazatel alright thank you!
[12:24:51] <torbjorn> at fpaste thou
[12:24:59] <duch_kazatel> torbjorn jsfiddle.net
[12:26:10] <torbjorn> it complains that i have html and meta and head tags in it
[12:26:25] <duch_kazatel> torbjorn supply just the relevant html and javascript.
[12:26:27] <duch_kazatel> not the whole page.
[12:26:33] <torbjorn> gah work
[12:26:51] <torbjorn> i already solved it via alternative routes, id rather move on
[12:26:56] <duch_kazatel> kay
[12:37:23] <hlve> hey guys, quick question. how can i sort this list alphebetically based on the child div's data-icon attr? http://jsfiddle.net/82jez/
[12:37:36] <hlve> alphenumerically rather, so 0-10 a-z
[12:40:16] <hlve> :\?
[12:40:22] <hlve> shoky to the rescue?
[12:42:53] <queso> How do you remove disabled="disabled" from an input button?  I've tried .removeAttr('disabled') and .attr('disabled', '') and .prop('disabled', false) and .removeProp('disabled').
[12:43:48] <h4k1m> hello guys
[12:44:00] <bitdestroyer> queso: I've used your first option in the past fine. Perhaps your selector isn't correct?
[12:44:10] <h4k1m> have anyone of you tried uglify? is it the best I can use to minify my js files?
[12:44:17] <hlve> anybody/
[12:44:18] <hlve> :(
[12:44:24] <BillCriswell> queso: .prop('disabled', false) would be the preferred way I think.
[12:44:49] <hlve> BillCriswell, got a sec to look at mine? i'm always bugging you guys for help lol
[12:45:28] <queso> bitdestroyer, BillCriswell: .prop('disabled', false) is working, thanks. I didn't know about .prop()
[12:45:49] <BillCriswell> hlve: I'd use http://tinysort.sjeiti.com/, they have an option for sorting by damn near naything.
[12:46:25] <hlve> BillCriswell, just need a simple jquery function, not an entire plugin lol
[12:46:28] <BillCriswell> queso: You posted that code in your question though?
[12:47:01] <queso> BillCriswell: Yeah... my code must not be calling the function with that code in it correctly..
[12:47:12] <h4k1m> anybody??
[12:47:38] <duch_kazatel> h4k1m uglify works.
[12:47:42] <BillCriswell> hlve: It's a pretty small plugin.
[12:48:21] <alanlke> velveeta: sorry about bailing right after I asked a question... i think if i'd waited 10 minutes I wouldn't have made it up the hill with the snow
[12:48:32] <h4k1m> duch_kazatel, using node.js from command line or on jscompress.com
[12:48:44] <Velveeta> no problem, i understand :)
[12:48:53] <queso> bitdestroyer, BillCriswell: Thanks for your help.
[12:49:07] <BillCriswell> No problem queso.
[12:49:42] <alanlke> if you're still up to assist, here's my application.js https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8851406
[12:53:26] <hlve> eeeeeehhhh
[12:53:27] <hlve> anyone?
[12:53:30] <hlve> :(
[12:53:58] <duch_kazatel> hlve you'll have to take the hard way out.
[12:54:19] <BillCriswell> I don't see the big deal about using such a small plugin lol.
[12:54:46] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/duxi/1/edit?html,js,output and it's done
[12:55:02] <h4k1m> duch_kazatel, I guess that using the command line is better but is there a way to compress a lot of files at once
[12:55:35] <BillCriswell> grunt? gulp?
[12:58:09] <hlve> BillCriswell, http://jsfiddle.net/82jez/2/ not working as intended though
[12:58:46] <BillCriswell> hlve: http://jsfiddle.net/82jez/3/
[12:59:01] <aberrant> is there a way to get the modal overlay in jqueryui to blur instead of changing opacity/color?
[12:59:29] <aberrant> specifically for modal dialogs
[12:59:41] <hlve> bill, any way to get the 0-10 before the a-z
[13:00:04] <__joshua__> aberrant: i don't believe the blur filter has wide browser support
[13:00:20] <aberrant> __joshua__: there are extensions for most modern browsers.
[13:01:23] <navneet1> how to register ##php
[13:01:33] <hlve> lol
[13:01:35] <torbjorn> how can I select an element that is both the next sibling and matches a given selector
[13:02:01] <__joshua__> aberrant: then just css for .ui-widget-overlay
[13:02:28] <aberrant> __joshua__: I tried that. It doesn't blur. It can change opacity / color, but blur apparently requires content.
[13:02:29] <__joshua__> .next(selector)
[13:02:38] <__joshua__> ah right
[13:02:51] <torbjorn> ah yes missed the small print of that, thanks
[13:03:25] <hlve> BillCriswell, just about got it working with that, 0-10 should be coming before a-z tho
[13:04:30] <__joshua__> aberrant: hack, but you could render the dom to a canvas, and show the canvas.  eg using http://experiments.hertzen.com/jsfeedback/    Probably not worth the effort
[13:04:45] <BillCriswell> hlve: Would need something custom to give to the sort function option.
[13:04:58] <aberrant> __joshua__: gah. Yeah, that's too much :)
[13:08:03] <aberrant> ok, another question re: dialog - is there a way to round the corners?
[13:08:27] <__joshua__> oh abberant: you can blur a root element
[13:08:47] <aberrant> __joshua__: what's that mean?
[13:09:11] <__joshua__> right now try -webkit-filter: blur(3px) (or whatever extension you need) on body
[13:09:42] <__joshua__> will blur all children.  So, don't use a modal, instead blur the root element of everything but the dialog
[13:09:45] <GuffyJarvis> I've got a div with an onclick event - and inside of that div i have other elements with onclick events. If I want to not fire the parent div's onclick event is that possible?
[13:10:06] <aberrant> __joshua__: I've gotta add that to the dialog js, right?
[13:10:10] <__joshua__> event.stopPropagation
[13:10:45] <GuffyJarvis> thanks joshua
[13:11:27] <__joshua__> abberant: onShow: function(){ $('page-selector-that-doesnt-include-this-dialog).addClass('blur-class-defined-somewhere'); }
[13:11:43] <aberrant> gotcha.
[13:11:44] <aberrant> thanks.
[13:13:47] <coderego> Hey guys, I'm trying to DRY (dont repeat yourself) up my code. This is my first time using AJAX really. Please see my code here: http://pastebin.com/vuxqiyvV   . I have two seperate forms on the page, each with different fields. Do I really need to repeat the javascript code twice? or is there a better way to do this? Thanks!
[13:14:18] <hlve> hey guys, quick question. how can i sort this list alphebetically based on the child div's data-icon attr? http://jsfiddle.net/82jez/ (trying this one more time lol)
[13:18:24] <aberrant> is there a way to tell an element to use its "default" radius instead of using the one that it inherits?
[13:19:16] <BillCriswell> aberrant: border-radius shouldn't be inherited?
[13:19:44] <aberrant> BillCriswell: to get rounded corners in dialog boxes, you have to set .ui-corner-all, and others - and this styles the buttons as well.
[13:20:06] <aberrant> I'd rather have consistent-looking buttons.
[13:37:01] <coderego> Hey guys, I'm trying to DRY (dont repeat yourself) up my code. This is my first time using AJAX really. Please see my code here: http://pastebin.com/vuxqiyvV   . I have two seperate forms on the page, each with different fields. Do I really need to repeat the javascript code twice? or is there a better way to do this? Thanks!
[13:37:53] <BillCriswell> aberrant: I'm not sure I'm following right. Are you saying you'd like to have the same corners across all UI elements or you want to adjust them independently?
[13:38:07] <__joshua__> coderego: where are repeating yourself?
[13:38:23] <coderego> __joshua__: eager for an answer
[13:38:26] <BillCriswell> coderego: You can look into .serializeArray()
[13:38:37] <coderego> __joshua__: as you can tell from my question, i do not like to repeat myself ;)
[13:38:56] <__joshua__> coderego: where are repeating yourself?
[13:40:39] <aberrant> BillCriswell: the jquery dialog rounded corners apply to all elements, including buttons. I'd rather have the buttons excluded from any radius specifications.
[13:41:21] <__joshua__> oh right, grammar.  Where are you repeating yourself in the pastebin?
[13:41:29] <BillCriswell> aberrant: You can do like .ui-button { border-radius: 5px; } or whatever class is applied to jQuery UI buttons.
[13:41:43] <aberrant> BillCriswell: yeah, but I don't know what to reset it to to make it "default"
[13:42:10] <BillCriswell> aberrant: 0.
[13:42:43] <aberrant> it's not 0
[13:42:46] <aberrant> 0 makes the buttons square
[13:43:43] <BillCriswell> It looks like the default is 4px for jQuery UI buttons in general.
[13:43:53] <aberrant> ok - thanks. will try 4px
[13:43:58] <aberrant> yup, that looks better.
[13:43:59] <aberrant> thanks.
[13:44:07] <BillCriswell> .... Ok.
[13:44:17] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[13:44:25] <aberrant> I'm not gonna go all steve jobs on pixels
[13:47:45] <__joshua__> Well we can't help you coderego if you can't be specific.  But you should do what BillCriswell suggested and use $(form).serializeArray() to create the query string, and might as well use $.post for brevity
[13:48:42] <BillCriswell> If they'd like a query string just .serialize() would be fine, but I like being able to modify and add things if I need to so I like the array.
[13:50:09] <coderego> __joshua__: I plan to use multiple forms. the serialize is a good idea and i will do that
[13:51:26] <__joshua__> multiple forms that have the same structure?
[13:54:38] <BillCriswell> coderego: If you're doing some_input_name_X you're more than likely doing something odd.
[13:59:26] <__joshua__> should use names and make them unique only for the form (or wrapper) that they are contained in.  you can then clone the form.
[14:06:02] <coderego> BillCriswell: that is what im doing. See the pastebin here: http://pastebin.com/vuxqiyvV. Is there a tutorial you can point me to that teaches a better way to do it?
[14:08:58] <coderego> __joshua__: but then I'm repeating the same code over and over...
[14:11:46] <BillCriswell> coderego: I have to run, but you'd probably be better off putting your code on like jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net. People tend to help a lot more when you do that.
[14:13:19] <BillCriswell> That way they can play with the code and see the results directly.
[14:13:19] <__joshua__> coderego: this is what im talking about http://jsfiddle.net/Rnvg3/
[14:20:51] <sebsen> hi, i get a json from the ebay-api with a list of items...for example item['galleryURL'][0]
[14:21:35] <sebsen> but sometimes there is no galleryurl set in it throws an error : type of item['galleryURL'][0] is undefined
[14:21:55] <sebsen>  if(typeof item.galleryURL !== 'undefined'){
[14:21:56] <sebsen>                         img = '<div class="item_image">'
[14:21:58] <sebsen> 						    + '<span class="helper"></span>'							
[14:21:59] <sebsen> 						    + '<img src="'+item['galleryURL'][0]+'" alt="'+item['title'][0]+'">'
[14:22:01] <sebsen> 					    + '</div>'
[14:22:02] <sebsen>                     };
[14:22:20] <sebsen> i tried this but it dont work it throws the error
[14:22:56] <duch_kazatel> `paste @ sebsen
[14:22:56] <b-ot> sebsen: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:24:31] <__joshua__> sebsen, galleryURL might be null, not undefined
[14:24:43] <__joshua__> just use if(item.galleryURL){
[14:25:47] <sebsen> but i get a TypeError that its undefined
[14:26:09] <sebsen> when its null the browser would be dont show an error
[14:26:19] <sebsen> wouldnt be
[14:26:20] <__joshua__> (null)[0] is a type error
[14:26:40] <duch_kazatel> sebsen you have to check the parent object before you try to access properties.
[14:26:47] <sebsen> ahhhh thanks
[14:27:03] <sebsen> but thats realy stupid
[14:27:37] <duch_kazatel> not at all.
[14:27:49] <duch_kazatel> you're trying to access a property on an object that doesn't exist.
[14:27:57] <duch_kazatel> it can't evaluate what you want.
[14:28:19] <duch_kazatel> so instead of assuming for you, it complains.
[14:29:48] <sebsen> yes sure but i get a really huge jsondata from ebay back and i have to check all the parents :(
[14:30:11] <duch_kazatel> what you need is a templating engine.
[14:30:12] <coderego> __joshua__: coooool stuff man. I like that. How about if I'm not actually using a form submit button? Like if im editing a table cell?
[14:30:33] <__joshua__> coderego: any event can be used

[15:12:49] <tucan2> hi
[15:24:58] <blue_warlock> hello badbodys
[15:36:16] <blue_warlock> why this code is not working
[15:36:18] <blue_warlock> $('#minime li:has(ul)').prepend('<button align=\"absmiddle\">+</button>');
[15:36:37] <blue_warlock> what did i do wrong
[15:37:38] <duch_kazatel> blue_warlock what are you trying to match on?
[15:38:01] <blue_warlock> all li in the ul with id minime
[15:38:18] <blue_warlock> <ul id="minime">
[15:38:26] <duch_kazatel> $('li:has(ul#minime)').prepend('<button align=\"absmiddle\">+</button>');
[15:38:33] <blue_warlock> all the li insides with ul must prepend a button
[15:38:48] <duch_kazatel> though since you can only use IDs once per page, you can do this instead: $('li:has(#minime)').prepend('<button align=\"absmiddle\">+</button>');
[15:39:07] <blue_warlock> no
[15:39:21] <blue_warlock> the starting ul had is minime
[15:39:35] <blue_warlock> the starting ul had id #minime
[15:39:37] <duch_kazatel> you want every li within #minime?
[15:39:45] <duch_kazatel> then $('#minime li');
[15:39:45] <blue_warlock> yea
[15:40:02] <blue_warlock> but the li must have an ul to show button
[15:40:12] <blue_warlock> otherwise has no sene
[15:40:17] <duch_kazatel> the li must contain a child UL?
[15:40:24] <blue_warlock> yea
[15:41:06] <blue_warlock> i$('#minime li:has(ul)').prepend('<button align=\"absmiddle\">+</button>');
[15:41:18] <duch_kazatel> could you setup a fiddle, then?
[15:41:20] <blue_warlock> i thought this was gud but doesnt work
[15:41:32] <blue_warlock> yes one sec
[15:41:35] <duch_kazatel> also, you know that only LIs can be direct children of ULs, right?
[15:42:30] <duch_kazatel> i'd try $('#minime li').has('ul') instead, too, since it's faster
[15:51:42] <blue_warlock> hum let me try that
[15:53:18] <duch_kazatel> if that doesn't work, setup some code on jsfiddle
[15:53:44] <blue_warlock> hum
[15:53:47] <blue_warlock> wait
[15:53:53] <blue_warlock> i understood the problem
[15:54:00] <blue_warlock> there are 2 #minime
[15:54:08] <duch_kazatel> that's invalid.
[15:54:12] <blue_warlock> infact
[15:54:15] <duch_kazatel> remove one or rename it.  problem solved :)
[15:54:20] <blue_warlock> but not signed in the console
[15:54:40] <blue_warlock> infact i must remove id and put a class
[15:54:44] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[15:54:47] <blue_warlock> that is gonna work
[15:54:54] <blue_warlock> maybe :P
[16:42:39] <jamto11> what do u call it when u drag and item such as a checkers piece and when u drop it it fixates on a box (like u can't put it in between 2 squares on a board)?
[16:48:42] <ionico> hi guys,  hope you can help me with this,  is almost done but i have  a problem: http://jsfiddle.net/BX8UM/5/
[16:49:40] <ionico> is a checkbox group that i want to work like radiobutton
[16:50:01] <ionico> it was working fine until my client ask me to set a default checked checkbox
[16:52:09] <ionico> the first checkbox is not unchecked when i click in another box
[16:53:00] <sacrebleu> ionico: are you doing first.click(); ?
[16:53:39] <ionico> ?
[16:53:49] <ionico> nop
[16:53:55] <ionico> how that work
[16:56:46] <sacrebleu> ok so
[16:57:18] <sacrebleu> you have your checkboxes, and for each checkbox in the group you must use the .change() or equivalent method to trigger when it changes the clicking off of each one that is on
[16:57:45] <sacrebleu> you can try just setting the checkbox values for the other checkboxes to off
[16:57:55] <sacrebleu> or you can test to see if the checkbox is checked on and then check it off, accordingly
[16:58:44] <sacrebleu> here is a doc: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4697941/jquery-make-checkboxes-act-like-radio-buttons

[17:07:58] <pom_life> Guys, I'm having a lot of trouble trying to use jQuery offline. I'm inserting "<script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"></script>" into my head, but it's not actually doing anything.
[17:08:35] <sacrebleu> pom_life you can't go through a CDN when offline
[17:08:59] <pom_life> What's the workaround? Saving that file as a local file and accessing it locally?
[17:09:35] <BillCriswell> pom_life: Do you mean an offline app or are you working on things locally?
[17:10:00] <pom_life> I'm working on a site offline that has no server online yet. I want to get it workable locally before transferring it online.
[17:10:27] <pom_life> I've been using jfiddle, but I like Sublime Text 2 better... but I need to figure out how to use it offline first.
[17:11:51] <sacrebleu> pom_life: then copy jquery latest to your offline area and include it directly
[17:11:54] <BillCriswell> pom_life: You should be able to use what you posted locally or on the server.
[17:12:20] <sacrebleu> in the developer console you can't click it and see the content of th efile?
[17:12:26] <sacrebleu> what do you mean by "doesn't do anything"
[17:14:14] <pom_life> sacrebleu: The jquery doesn't take effect if I run it offline.
[17:14:38] <BillCriswell> pom_life: Is the computer you're running this on connected to the internet?
[17:14:42] <pom_life> I've also tried copy/pasting the code on the "http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js" site and making a file called jquery.js and including it, also to no avail.
[17:14:46] <pom_life> BillCriswell: yes
[17:15:35] <BillCriswell> pom_life: Are you running a local server or did you just open the file normally in the browser, does the location bar look like "file:///".
[17:15:55] <pom_life> BillCriswell: The latter.
[17:18:39] <BillCriswell> pom_life: I think that's your issue?
[17:18:57] <pom_life> So I need to run apache or something I guess?
[17:19:14] <BillCriswell> Let me try it and see.
[17:19:46] <pom_life> I can give you the source if you need it
[17:21:11] <scrupul0us1> im having an issue when I "each" a group of elements to get an attribute where the first value is always undefined: http://pastebin.com/58ftttMT  thank you
[17:22:07] <pom_life> scrupul0us1: You typo'd on line 11
[17:22:12] <ionico> i tried .fist but is not working : http://jsfiddle.net/BX8UM/9/
[17:22:21] <BillCriswell> pom_life: Yeah, that's the issue. You should be able to still get it by a relative path.
[17:22:27] <scrupul0us1> @pom: yeah i manually typed that into paste bin ;)
[17:22:47] <BillCriswell> <script src="js/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script>
[17:22:59] <BillCriswell> works fine
[17:23:39] <scrupul0us1> hrm ill go run it through fiddle... im running 1.9.1
[17:23:43] <BillCriswell> pom_life: A cool tool I've been using is mixture.io, beats running a local server in my opinion.
[17:23:54] <pom_life> BillCriswell: Explain?
[17:24:00] <BillCriswell> It's really nice for prototyping stuff quick.
[17:24:12] <BillCriswell> Explain mixture.io or running the files locally?
[17:24:19] <pom_life> The former
[17:25:03] <pom_life> Also, even running it locally isn't doing anything. :/
[17:25:19] <BillCriswell> pom_life: Sure the paths right?
[17:26:04] <pom_life> I copy/pasted all of this site: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js into a file called "jquery.js", and put it into the /js/ path of the main folder "js/jquery.js". Then I used this: <script src="js/jquery.js"></script>
[17:26:06] <pom_life> To no avail
[17:26:18] <__joshua__> billcriswell: why not just open the file locally? (with --allow-file-access-from-files)
[17:26:44] <scrupul0us1> http://jsfiddle.net/eD7gh/
[17:27:26] <scrupul0us1> doesnt work for me on 1.9.1 + on jsfiddle
[17:28:22] <BillCriswell> __joshua__: I guess I have that enabled,
[17:28:35] <BillCriswell> I was trying to help pom_life.
[17:28:56] <pom_life> How can I enable that and get this working?
[17:28:57] <__joshua__> yeah, im just asking why mixture.io is worth money
[17:32:12] <ionico> <sacrebleu> thanks it is almost done with what you told me,  but when i cheked another box and i want to checked again is not posible: http://jsfiddle.net/BX8UM/10/
[17:32:18] <ionico> can you help me ?
[17:34:06] <scrupul0us1> BillCriswell: thoughts?
[17:34:30] <pom_life> I don't think it's possible to run jQuery locally.
[17:35:04] <__joshua__> what?
[17:35:07] <__joshua__> nonsense
[17:35:15] <duch_kazatel> it is.
[17:35:18] <duch_kazatel> i do it all the time.
[17:35:28] <__joshua__> its just javascript
[17:35:30] <pom_life> Nothing that is recommended seems to work
[17:35:47] <__joshua__> what errors are you getting pom_life?
[17:35:56] <__joshua__> and what browser?
[17:36:07] <pom_life> It's simply not reading the jQuery, regardless of how I link it in the head tags. Chrome, FWIW.
[17:36:17] <__joshua__> and no error?
[17:36:19] <duch_kazatel> how are you loading it?
[17:36:24] <duch_kazatel> what's an example link?
[17:36:46] <pom_life> I'm just opening it through file///, that is to say double clicking the .html file in the folder.
[17:36:57] <__joshua__> chrome will not read local files by default, you must  --allow-file-access-from-files
[17:37:07] <__joshua__> with a cmd switch when you open chrome
[17:37:20] <pom_life> Where can I read up on accomplishing that?
[17:37:29] <duch_kazatel> what os are you in?
[17:37:33] <pom_life> 7
[17:37:35] <__joshua__> you can tell if you have this problem by checking what error you are getting
[17:37:43] <pom_life> There's no immediate error in console
[17:37:58] <scrupul0us1> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18586921/how-to-launch-html-using-chrome-at-allow-file-access-from-files-mode
[17:38:08] <__joshua__> really? are you loading stale html?
[17:38:39] <dismist> if yo console draggin they mothafuckin feet while u tryin to get shit done, yo ass may be infected wit a virus.  i got this antivirus shield yo... they shit keep yo shit cleaner than a mothafucka
[17:38:45] <BillCriswell> pom_life: Check the network tab.
[17:39:10] <__joshua__> if it is a local file access issue you will definately get an error
[17:39:21] <dismist> yall overcomplicatin all this
[17:39:30] <dismist> my softawre package got all that
[17:39:36] <BillCriswell> dismist: All right.
[17:39:36] <duch_kazatel> have we seen a copy of this file?
[17:39:59] <dismist> pm me my man i will take care of you
[17:41:09] <ryanneufeld> dismist: you selling something?
[17:41:25] <dismist> you know what ryan, i asked yo mama the same thing
[17:41:29] <dismist> guess what happened next
[17:42:00] <dismist> u got to keep they heads ringin bill
[17:42:27] <pom_life> lol. Even after launching chrome with –allow-file-access-from-files, it STILL won't run the jQuery!
[17:42:29] <dismist> otherwise these little baby ballin assclowns like this fella right here will try to snag that crown when u lookin the other wayt
[17:42:40] <__joshua__> wat
[17:42:46] <dismist> u heard me josh
[17:42:54] <dismist> the choir aint preachin to me
[17:42:58] <imjoshdean_> ...wut
[17:43:04] <dismist> yeah u heard it right the first time
[17:43:19] <BillCriswell> I have no idea what's going on.
[17:43:19] <scrupul0us1> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[17:43:28] <dismist> scrupulous do
[17:43:30] <dismist> and thats a dumb mothafucka
[17:43:37] <dismist> so what say you on yo behalf?
[17:43:46] <ryanneufeld> diminoten: do you have a question? or are you just here trying to get people to PM you so they'll buy your stuff?
[17:43:46] <scrupul0us1> ლ(｀ー´ლ)
[17:43:58] <pom_life> Okay. Loading my web app locally in Firefox will ALSO not activate the jQuery.
[17:44:06] <ryanneufeld> dismist: do you have a question? or are you just here trying to get people to PM you so they'll buy your stuff?
[17:44:16] <dismist> ryan... if you puttin me on the spot to ask a mothafuckin technical question then i actually do have one for ya
[17:44:50] <ryanneufeld> dismist: keep it clean brah
[17:44:51] <dismist> im trying to execute a series of jquery ajax commands to fetch remote url output..... but in proper synchronicity
[17:45:15] <pom_life> Jesus... why does this have to be such a nightmare :(
[17:45:17] <dismist> i dont want the function reporting to the fastest server returning feedback before the order in which i called it in my code
[17:45:32] <scrupul0us1> diable async
[17:45:35] <BillCriswell> async: false
[17:45:39] <dismist> then it locks the browser up\
[17:45:39] <__joshua__> or
[17:45:49] <dismist> so we got to figure this synchronicity out
[17:45:51] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @dismist
[17:45:51] <b-ot> dismist: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:46:08] <__joshua__> $.get(first).then($.get.bind(second)).then($.get.bind(third));
[17:46:10] <dismist> meanwhile ive been venturing down other paths to solve this... one of them being the usage of nested set timeouts
[17:46:24] <__joshua__> (if you using jquery)
[17:46:24] <dismist> wehich seems to work rather unsuspectingly marvelous
[17:46:29] <dismist> though i imagine it is quite a resource hog
[17:46:44] <dismist> if i think about the logic behind such an algorithm
[17:46:56] <dismist> or lack there of in the case of any scripts i program
[17:47:16] <scrupul0us1> bill http://jsfiddle.net/eD7gh/ thoughts on the undefined?
[17:47:49] <BillCriswell> scrupul0us1: http://jsfiddle.net/eD7gh/1/
[17:48:06] <dismist> bill whats he trippin on
[17:48:35] <dismist> is that some sort of optical illusion
[17:48:41] <dismist> the only difference is a semicolon
[17:48:49] <scrupul0us1> nah its the variable
[17:48:55] <scrupul0us1> i just defined it
[17:48:58] <scrupul0us1> he set it to ""
[17:49:00] <dismist> damn
[17:49:05] <ryanneufeld> alo rmurphey how are you?
[17:49:11] <dismist> u see how those poor fundamentals cost u?
[17:49:21] <scrupul0us1> i was trying to concatinate an uninstantiated varible
[17:49:29] <ryanneufeld> dismist: you're not helping, shut up please
[17:49:31] <rmurphey> hey ryanneufeld
[17:49:36] <BillCriswell> scrupul0us1: That one caught me before.
[17:49:41] <dismist> proper variable intialization and naming my man.... now uve just burned up hours of time on something a monkey could solve if u provided him with a fine toothed comb
[17:49:58] <dismist> (how u think bill did it, lol)
[17:50:07] <dismist> bill no offense big daddy
[17:50:10] <BillCriswell> I don't own a comb.
[17:50:30] <pom_life> Okay: Check this out guys. I loaded all the files onto a webserver of mine @ http://www.winningfundraising.net/Chromatica/game.html , and it STILL won't enable the jQuery when I include "<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js"></script>" in the head tags.
[17:50:30] <scrupul0us1> Thanks Bill... Fresh set of eyes is always helpful, much obliged
[17:50:37] <dismist> thats cuz u aint got no hair bill
[17:50:41] <BillCriswell> No problem, scrupul0us1.
[17:50:44] <scrupul0us1> =)
[17:50:54] <dismist> fresh eyes from bill? maybe 40 years ago bro
[17:51:00] <BillCriswell> dismist: I have hair, thinning out, but it's there. Is there a point to you?
[17:51:03] <BillCriswell> dismist: 29.

[17:52:49] <BillCriswell> I'd love to know where they come from.
[17:52:54] <__joshua__> pom_life: its loaded for me
[17:53:03] <__joshua__> why do you think it hasn't?
[17:53:13] <pom_life> __joshua__: from that link? When you enter a name and hit submit, that div disappears?
[17:53:15] <scrupul0us1> more than likely the basements of suburban homes
[17:53:21] <scrupul0us1> =)
[17:54:08] <BillCriswell> scrupul0us1: I'd love to understand why though. Wonder who could be that bored.
[17:54:19] * scrupul0us1 shrugs
[17:54:37] <scrupul0us1> theres only so much porn an WOW a person can take
[17:54:56] <__joshua__> pom_life: no, you are loading jquery-min, and jquery, but no actually application code that i can see
[17:55:21] <scrupul0us1> anywho, i shall digress from degrading the channels purpose.. thanks again Bill
[17:55:34] <BillCriswell> scrupul0us1: No problem!
[17:57:18] <pom_life> __joshua__: I just added <script type="text/javascript" src="script.js" ></script> to the head, neglected that.
[17:57:25] <pom_life> Even still, it's not loading.
[17:57:53] <pom_life> Now I'm getting $ is not defined as if jQiuery wasn't loading ,though.
[17:58:13] <__joshua__> did you add it after jquery?
[17:58:18] <pom_life> No, before
[17:58:22] <__joshua__> dont
[17:58:25] <pom_life> k
[17:58:59] <pom_life> lo and behold
[17:59:00] <pom_life> it works
[17:59:06] <pom_life> Thank you so much, sir.
[17:59:29] <__joshua__> np and gl
[18:06:16] <menikmati> not sure if this is the correct channel to ask but i created a cookie in php and i want to pass that cookie along via ajax how would that be done?
[18:06:59] <digitalsanctum> hi folks, I'm curious if jquery 1.11.0 and ui version 1.9.2 should be 100% compatible?
[18:08:02] <ryanneufeld> digitalsanctum: there isn't a reason they shouldn't be
[18:08:24] <digitalsanctum> ryanneufeld: ok, thx
[18:08:25] <ryanneufeld> digitalsanctum: requirements are jQuery 1.6+
[18:08:31] <ryanneufeld> which 1.11.0 fits the bill
[18:08:52] <digitalsanctum> ryanneufeld: i saw that, but wondering if there were any caveats or known issues
[18:09:37] <ryanneufeld> digitalsanctum: http://jqueryui.com/changelog/
[18:09:44] <ryanneufeld> would be a good place to start
[18:12:08] <TheJHNZ> would it be hard to have a listener running for new posts, sort of how twitter does it ?
[18:12:13] <TheJHNZ> it says '3 new posts'
[18:12:15] <TheJHNZ> etc
[18:12:40] <TheJHNZ> would it just do an ajax loop every 5 seconds or so ?
[18:13:04] <TheJHNZ> or could you make a json listener
[18:13:12] <TheJHNZ> that listens for changes in json
[18:13:12] <ionico> can you help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/BX8UM/9/
[18:14:26] <TheJHNZ> what do you mean its still checked ?
[18:14:41] <TheJHNZ> ionico: http://joshua.geek.nz/s/JHNZ02-07-15-14-37.png
[18:16:09] <NChief2> change attr() to prop()
[18:16:15] <ionico> on the second click the first checkbox remains checked
[18:16:31] <BillCriswell> TheJHNZ: That would be doable.
[18:17:11] <TheJHNZ> i see
[18:17:22] <TheJHNZ> would you just make a loop ? or
[18:18:31] <TheJHNZ> well i'd make a timestamp in jquery on page and put that in the url to the server, so the server knows what posts to look for after set timestamp
[18:20:59] <ionico> and i did this, works better but i cant check the fisrt box again: http://jsfiddle.net/BX8UM/12/
[18:23:02] <NChief2> ionico: http://jsfiddle.net/BX8UM/13/
[18:23:33] <NChief2> you had a click and change event
[18:23:35] <ionico> NICE!!! thanks!!
[18:23:54] <NChief2> np
[18:34:06] <BillCriswell> TheJHNZ: I'd use recursion and a timeout.
[18:35:27] <BillCriswell> TheJHNZ: You can also look into sockets.io
[18:35:44] <BillCriswell> Er, http://socket.io/
[18:45:55] <mdev> can jquery execute multiple setinterval post calls ok?
[18:46:14] <BillCriswell> mdev: Don't see why not.
[18:46:46] <mdev> think I tried it with raw javascript and my callback was getting the wrong data
[18:46:51] <mdev> but could have been code error
[18:46:56] <mdev> so i'll give it a go thanks
[18:48:40] <blue_warlock> guys
[18:48:55] <blue_warlock> why the .resize wont execute a function ?
[18:48:58] <blue_warlock>  $(window).resize(onload());
[18:50:01] <BillCriswell> blue_warlock: You just want .resize(onload)
[18:50:14] <blue_warlock> onload its a function i wrote
[18:50:21] <BillCriswell> Right.
[18:50:24] <blue_warlock> function onload()
[18:50:47] <blue_warlock> i execute that function when the page open
[18:50:53] <blue_warlock> and it works
[18:50:54] <BillCriswell> $(window).on('resize', onload).trigger('resize') is probbly what you're after. That'll call a resize automatically and again after every resize.
[18:50:58] <BillCriswell> blue_warlock: Right.
[18:51:01] <blue_warlock> but wont works on .resize
[18:51:21] <blue_warlock> hum
[18:51:33] <tw2113> blue_warlock, did you try without the () ?
[18:51:35] <blue_warlock> do you think its a good way to check windows size ?
[18:51:49] <blue_warlock> lemme try it
[18:52:12] <BillCriswell> If you need the numbers in Javascript sure. I'd try to avoid writing things that need to know the exact window size, though.
[18:52:16] <tw2113> if it works, BillCriswell gets credit
[18:52:39] <BillCriswell> I'm used to saying things 12 times before people try it lol.
[18:53:00] <tw2113> i should try that :D
[18:53:08] <blue_warlock> it is working
[18:53:11] <blue_warlock> but
[18:53:40] <blue_warlock> the onload(); outside the .resize is not working
[18:53:47] <blue_warlock> properly
[18:54:07] <blue_warlock> the only way i had to let it work was to write 2 times the fookin function
[18:54:13] <tw2113> isn't it a case of the () causes immediate execution, and without it's passed in like a parameter?
[18:54:21] <blue_warlock> but i wont make these rubbish
[18:54:46] <__joshua__> tw2113 is right
[18:55:07] <tw2113> *fist pump* i know something about javascript
[18:55:56] <__joshua__> or more accurately, the handler you were bind to the resize event is probably 'undefined', depending on what the function onload returns
[18:56:10] <BillCriswell> blue_warlock: http://jsbin.com/hate/1/edit?html,js,output
[18:57:27] <__joshua__> so i guess it could work if onload was function onload(){ /* do stuff */ return onload; }
[18:57:49] <coderego> Hey guys, I'm still having trouble getting AJAX to go through serialize instead of naming each individual input. I have posted the code here:   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21617312/jquery-edit-table-get-data-through-serialize-instead/
[18:58:06] <__joshua__> give them names
[18:58:12] <__joshua__> like in the jsfiddle i sent you
[18:58:28] <coderego> __joshua__: i thought you said I could just use the name of the parent object? Like the table?
[18:58:35] <__joshua__> no
[18:58:46] <coderego> so I have to name every feild every time?
[18:58:56] <__joshua__> yes you have to name your input elements
[18:59:08] <__joshua__> don't need classes or ids, just names
[18:59:32] <__joshua__> then you can $('what-ever-the-hell-my-form-is-called).serialize();
[18:59:43] <coderego> what if i dont have a form?
[18:59:53] <coderego> the code i have right now is working without a form
[19:00:12] <__joshua__> the form is there to make it easier for you to collect up all the name:value pairs
[19:00:53] <coderego> Do you still have the jsfidle? i crashed :(
[19:00:56] <__joshua__> if you put your code in jsfiddle, i will show you
[19:01:24] <__joshua__> http://jsfiddle.net/Rnvg3/
[19:02:17] <coderego> http://jsfiddle.net/Rnvg3/1/
[19:02:21] <__joshua__> btw, you don't need a form, just a single jquery selector that will match in the fielkds
[19:02:23] <__joshua__> fields*
[19:03:00] <coderego> please show me? im very new at this :\
[19:03:15] <BillCriswell> I think the form is good to have though.
[19:04:38] <blue_warlock> hummm
[19:04:50] <blue_warlock> thats another way BillCriswell ?
[19:06:29] <BillCriswell> coderego: http://jsbin.com/niyut/1/edit?html,js,output this help?
[19:06:37] <BillCriswell> blue_warlock: Yes.
[19:07:42] <coderego> BillCriswell: yes. But my question is now: if I have a hidden form inputs
[19:07:48] <coderego> as u see in my code
[19:07:56] <coderego> they only show when i click the table
[19:08:01] <coderego> and i only want to edit one row at a time
[19:08:11] <coderego> (this is for a user updating a data table)
[19:08:58] <Nephro> How do I make a certain div update itself from time to time
[19:09:21] <BillCriswell> Nephro: setInterval or a socket could work.
[19:10:17] <Nephro> setIntrval, that's fine, should it be in a loop or a recursive/tail call or smth?
[19:10:36] <BillCriswell> coderego: So you click a button and it hides the text and shows some inputs?
[19:10:38] <__joshua__> setTimeout would be used recursively, not setInterval
[19:11:57] <coderego> BillCriswell: no, you click the table row and it hides the text and shows some inputs
[19:12:08] <Nephro> __joshua__, how do I do proper recursion in js
[19:12:32] <__joshua__> function recursion(){ recursion(): }.    don't actually run that
[19:12:33] <Nephro> I don't really want recursion, because since it is infinite, some kind of stack overflow would occur
[19:12:37] <BillCriswell> Nephro: Yeah, I think function updateDiv() { $.get('/check-div-updates', function(updateHTML){ $('div').html(updateHTML); setTimeout( updateDiv, 1000 ); }); } updateDiv();
[19:12:38] <Nephro> I need something like tail calls
[19:13:08] <__joshua__> why?  setInterval will call a function every whatever
[19:13:15] <BillCriswell> I don't know what that means to be honest lol
[19:13:37] <BillCriswell> coderego: Ok.
[19:13:53] <__joshua__> look, you probably only want recursion if you are dealing with a recursive data structure
[19:14:05] <Nephro> a tail call is when the last statement of a function is a FOO call, and the FOO is called after returning from the function
[19:14:26] <Nephro> done for infinite recursion without keeping the stack frames
[19:14:27] <__joshua__> Nephro: you are barking up the wrong tree here, almost certainly
[19:14:49] <Nephro> I know what recursion is
[19:14:59] <__joshua__> I don't know if you can guarantee tail call elimination will occur
[19:15:00] <Nephro> that's why i am asking whether js supports tail calls
[19:15:12] <__joshua__> some engines might
[19:15:15] <DevePy> Hello, how to select all input and textarea form whit jquery
[19:15:39] <DevePy> example: $("#myform form[name=body]")
[19:15:44] <BillCriswell> coderego: http://jsbin.com/niyut/2/edit I cheated.
[19:15:58] <DevePy> and have multiple input and textarea and one selector
[19:16:00] <__joshua__> nephro: its not in the spec.  you must use a trampoline OR don't recurse to be safe
[19:16:21] <BillCriswell> DevePy: There's :input
[19:16:32] <BillCriswell> That would get all types of inputs including textareas.
[19:16:38] <__joshua__> devepy: use a comma
[19:16:48] <__joshua__> 'selector1, selector2
[19:17:07] <DevePy> __joshua__: yea but need iterate dict in json
[19:17:39] <DevePy> BillCriswell: i don't understand
[19:17:47] <BillCriswell> #myform form[name=body] :input
[19:17:59] <BillCriswell> What do you need to do with all of them?
[19:18:26] <__joshua__> DevePy: i have no idea what that means.  can you explain?
[19:27:28] <Nephro> How do I scroll a div with jquery?
[19:28:55] <__joshua__> div.scrollTop(offset)?
[19:29:49] <Nephro> Any percentage-wise method? The data in the div is not static, so I don
[19:29:55] <Nephro> 't really know the pixel count
[19:30:35] <blue_warlock> Bill is gone ?
[19:31:12] <blue_warlock> BillTheButcher ?
[19:31:39] <FriendlySeal> o__________o
[19:31:41] <__joshua__> nephro? are you trying to bring a certain element to invisibility?
[19:31:51] <__joshua__> if you need percentages, you could calculate them
[19:32:18] <Nephro> seems redundant to me
[19:32:27] <Nephro> css can operate with percentages, why can
[19:32:27] <__joshua__> ?
[19:32:30] <Nephro> 't jquery
[19:32:43] <__joshua__> offsetting a scroll is not CSS
[19:33:36] <Nephro> it is not, but CSS has the notion of percentage-wise sizing, means jquery should in theory somehow also be able to acquire these numbers
[19:33:37] <__joshua__> if want 50%, when scroll $el.innerheight/2 or something
[19:36:00] <__joshua__> its a thin wrapper to this
[19:36:01] <__joshua__> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/element.scrollTop?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=DOM%2Felement.scrollTop
[19:38:14] <DevePy> I can use :input[name=name_example]
[19:38:21] <__joshua__> yes
[19:38:33] <__joshua__> probably need quotes around name_example
[19:38:39] <__joshua__> maybe
[19:38:56] <__joshua__> oh wait, don't want :input
[19:39:04] <__joshua__> just input[name="hi"]
[19:39:21] <DevePy> __joshua__: thanks
[19:41:29] <DevePy> How to simulate hover or focus, i'm try using tooltip bootstrap if form input is empty load tooltip...
[19:42:11] <__joshua__> simulate in code? can't reliably
[19:42:20] <__joshua__> hover at least
[19:43:02] <__joshua__> if you just need it for development, chrome dev tools can set the element state
[19:44:30] <DevePy> Thanks :)
[19:51:27] <CorySimmons> Hey guys, I know when a DOM element changes to a specific class. How can I bind an event to that?
[19:52:30] <__joshua__> dom mutation events don't have good support
[19:52:47] <CorySimmons> Hm
[19:52:50] <CorySimmons> What about uRL?

[19:55:43] <SimbaLion> or maybe tell me how to figure it out with devtools, if there's an easy way
[19:56:10] <__joshua__> probably 'impress:stepenter'
[19:57:30] <__joshua__> unfortunately, I don't see any args added to impress:stepenter
[19:57:54] <__joshua__> will have to sniff the page on every impress:stepenter
[19:58:19] <FriendlySeal> snif my but
[20:00:57] <CorySimmons> __joshua__: console.log(impress:stepenter); returns unexpected token :
[20:01:20] <FriendlySeal> dood
[20:01:29] <tw2113> how can we sniff a conjunction FriendlySeal
[20:01:33] <FriendlySeal> how r u even using the plugin
[20:01:39] <FriendlySeal> CorySimmons,
[20:01:49] <FriendlySeal> if u cant even write javascript
[20:02:10] <CorySimmons> Thanks FriendlySeal
[20:02:14] <FriendlySeal> no really
[20:02:18] <CorySimmons> I'm glad you're here, really
[20:02:18] <FriendlySeal> take a seat
[20:02:20] <tw2113> FriendlySeal, i trust you use jslint a lot
[20:03:37] <__joshua__> document.getElementById('impress').addEventListener('impress:stepenter', function(){ console.log('here'); });
[20:05:30] <__joshua__> that work corysimmons?
[20:05:48] <CorySimmons> __joshua__: Kinda. Returns 'here' when I flip through slides
[20:06:01] <CorySimmons> Trying to figure out how to grab the url now
[20:06:48] <CorySimmons> Got it
[20:06:52] <__joshua__> window.location.href or similiar will do
[20:06:53] <__joshua__> right
[20:07:02] <__joshua__> have fun, ima off
[20:07:07] <tw2113> the window url or the slide url?
[20:08:54] <CorySimmons> __joshua__: http://pastie.org/8707116 :D
[20:09:13] <CorySimmons> FriendlySeal: I learned how to JS. Thanks for teaching me
[20:10:10] <FriendlySeal> i dont think u did

[20:13:02] <DevePy> How to fire event trigger one time
[20:14:47] <scipy53> I'm having trouble using functions from various plugins. Every time I try calling a function, I get: TypeError: $(...).function_name is not a function
[20:14:57] <scipy53> Please help, been struggling for hours
[20:15:12] <scipy53> Everything was working fine, and suddenly collapsed
[20:15:50] <CorySimmons> DevePy: $('.foo').one(function() { … });

[20:16:04] <blue_warlock> guys
[20:16:12] <CorySimmons> scipy53: Using a lot of minified plugins?
[20:16:20] <scipy53> Yeah
[20:16:26] <scipy53> CorySimmons, ^
[20:16:39] <blue_warlock> how do i check if a <li> has button
[20:16:47] <scipy53> CorySimmons, Well, like 3-4
[20:17:24] <blue_warlock> $('.minime li:has(button)') ?
[20:17:46] <NBhosting> think i got it \w
[20:17:53] <blue_warlock> but i must use it in a conditional
[20:18:29] <SimbaLion> Grr, this has me stumped, I'm trying to use http://slicknav.com/ and in particular it seems the .js class does nothing, there's no explanation on the page for it, and I'm not strong enough in javascript to know how to fix it
[20:20:12] <DevePy> CorySimmons: I'm try this but not work http://jsfiddle.net/c9FHy/
[20:23:22] <blue_warlock> where is bill

[20:24:32] <blue_warlock> hm ?
[20:24:56] <blue_warlock> Deve ??? you made a fidle but where is html ?
[20:25:27] <DevePy> Some one knows why not work this http://jsfiddle.net/c9FHy/
[20:25:35] <blue_warlock> you are missing a closure
[20:25:51] <SimbaLion> oh I see, I needed to add document.documentElement.className = "js"
[20:25:54] <DevePy> blue_warlock: you talk to me
[20:26:07] <blue_warlock> placement: 'left'
[20:26:07] <blue_warlock>     }); <<<<<
[20:26:44] <blue_warlock> after that ) put a  ;

[20:27:25] <DevePy> you talk to me: I'm work whit module pattern...
[20:27:36] <CorySimmons> scipy53: Try putting semi-colons before your minified JS
[20:29:10] <DevePy> after all those: thanks for you clarification but this does not solve the problem.
[20:30:23] <scipy53> CorySimmons, In the actual files?
[20:30:27] <blue_warlock> hum dunno then
[20:30:32] <CorySimmons> DevePy: Sorry, this -should- work according to their doc but it's not on jsfid http://jsfiddle.net/c9FHy/1/
[20:30:51] <CorySimmons> scipy53: Yep. Prefix them with a semi-colon just before all the min js
[20:31:37] <CorySimmons> scipy53: http://stackoverflow.com/a/7365214/175825
[20:32:02] <scipy53> CorySimmons, Will try, thanks

[20:40:21] <blue_warlock> i dont get errors
[20:40:24] <FriendlySeal> hey come to my site
[20:42:05] <ZY> hello people! who is russian?
[20:42:34] <blue_warlock> bah
[20:42:40] <blue_warlock> im gonna sleep
[20:44:19] <ZY> what does mean "!" before "function" : "!function($, wysi) { }(window.jQuery, window.wysihtml5);" ???
[20:44:26] <scipy53> CorySimmons, It looks like something is pulling in another version of jquery ...
[20:44:47] <scipy53> I add 1.10.1 myself, but I see 1.7.2 later on in the head ...
[20:45:46] <CorySimmons> scipy53: Is this WordPress?
[20:45:58] <ZY> help me, please
[20:46:00] <shoky> ZY:  it's one way to make an IIFE. more commonly you see:   (function($) { ... })(window.jQuery)
[20:46:11] <shoky> but with the !  it's one less character...
[20:46:46] <scipy53> CorySimmons, Nope, it's a django app I made
[20:49:38] <ZY> shoky: thanx!
[20:51:07] <jhjohnson1> you sure, shoky?
[20:51:22] <jhjohnson1> the () at the end invokes it, and it's the same in both. curious how it's 1 less character?
[20:51:23] <shoky> jhjohnson1 yup
[20:51:46] <jhjohnson1> the wrapping() creates a closure
[20:51:55] <shoky> (function($) {})(jQuery);
[20:51:58] <shoky> !function($) {}{jQuery);
[20:52:03] <shoky> one less char ^
[20:52:21] <jhjohnson1> but the difference being the latter isn't a closure?
[20:52:25] <shoky> no, the function itself creates a closure
[20:52:51] <jhjohnson1> not really
[20:52:51] <shoky> no there is no difference
[20:52:57] <shoky> those are equivalent
[20:53:34] <jsharpminor> I'm trying to write an alphabetized insert, but it no worky... http://jsfiddle.net/jsharpminor/Xtheq/ ... help please?
[20:53:56] <shoky> jhjohnson1  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5827290/javascript-function-leading-bang-syntax
[20:54:33] <shoky> the  ! turns it into an expression
[20:54:38] <shoky> same as the parens ()
[20:55:11] <jhjohnson1> gotcha, thanks!
[20:55:43] <jhjohnson1> in the case of: !function($) { var foo = 'bar'; }(jQuery);, would window.foo === undefined?
[20:55:52] <shoky> yup
[20:56:32] <jhjohnson1> mind blown. i've totally misunderstood the wrapping () for years.
[20:56:53] <shoky> heh
[20:57:27] <shoky> btw that doesn't really have to do with closures
[20:57:39] <shoky> just with local scopes, which any function will have
[20:58:16] <jsharpminor> http://jsfiddle.net/jsharpminor/Xtheq/3/ -- any help appreciated
[21:01:05] <shoky> jsharpminor:  $(toAdd).insertBefore($(targetList))   means:  inject the "toAdd" html before each element in targetList
[21:01:40] <shoky> maybe you meant  .insertBefore(this)
[21:02:26] <jsharpminor> shoky:     .insertBefore(this).fadeIn("fast");  <-- like that?
[21:02:42] <jsharpminor> but how do I tell it to insert toAdd?
[21:03:18] <scipy53> CorySimmons, Omg ... it was due to a chat widget conflicting. They probably updated it recently.
[21:04:31] <shoky> jsharpminor:  http://jsfiddle.net/Xtheq/6/
[21:04:51] <jsharpminor> wow, you're awesome
[21:05:49] <jsharpminor> also, yeah, !added... that was dumb on my part
[21:06:08] <jsharpminor> but i've spent a long time on this and i'm to the point of tearing out my hair, you just saved my rear. thanks.
[21:06:25] <shoky> np
[21:06:32] <shoky> and g'night
[21:07:07] <jsharpminor> thanks, you too
[21:08:12] <jsharpminor> hey shoky
[21:08:17] <jsharpminor> before you go, one more q if possible...
[21:08:42] <jsharpminor> Uncaught TypeError: Object <li id="Url1380">Trillian</li> has no method 'text'
[21:08:47] <jsharpminor> when I put it in my site, I got that.
[21:09:23] <jsharpminor> oh
[21:09:25] <jsharpminor> nvm
[21:09:26] <jsharpminor> found the problem i think
[21:28:38] <CorySimmons> I can I iterate over an array of div classes and assign += 2000 to a data attribute on each of them? For instance, div.step would have data-y="2000", the next one 4000, etc...
[21:28:48] <CorySimmons> *How
[21:34:31] <CorySimmons> nm got it
[21:37:10] <CorySimmons> impress().init() doesn't seem to be firing -after- all the data-y attributes get set… http://pastie.org/8707263
[21:37:47] <CorySimmons> Anyone have any idea?
[21:40:12] <Velveeta> corysimmons: you're passing it as an extra parameter to .each(), where it's not gonna be used… put it on the line after your each() completes
[21:41:00] <Velveeta> the way you're passing it, it's invoked at the time you call .each(), and then discarded by .each(), i think you're wanting it to execute after the loop completes, so it should go on the next line
[21:41:17] <CorySimmons> lol
[21:41:27] <CorySimmons> Thanks, I'm a newb
[21:41:32] <Velveeta> no problem
[21:44:08] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/VRbL5/17/ <-- I try to trim the html code and replace it back trimmed but i don´t manage to do that in "var value = $.trim($(this).val());"
[21:47:19] <Velveeta> you want to use .text(), not .val()
[21:47:25] <Velveeta> .val() is only valid for form elements
[21:48:16] <Whiskey> its empty, its on top now anyways changed little bit in the code
[21:48:20] <Whiskey> jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/VRbL5/18/
[21:48:46] <Whiskey> looks like it remove the text insted of whitespaces
[21:49:23] <Velveeta> you're still using .val() instead of .text()
[21:49:38] <Velveeta> .val() will return an empty string for those spans, use .text()
[21:49:45] <Whiskey> oo not removed the old one
[21:50:58] <Velveeta> what?
[21:51:05] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/VRbL5/19/ Velveeta: still not trimmed
[21:52:13] <Jonno_FTW> hi, if I have a long running piece of code (ie. a very long loop), how can I have a loading animation while it runs?
[21:52:14] <Velveeta> yes it is
[21:52:30] <Velveeta> look at the dom inspector, it's trimmed
[21:53:01] <Whiskey> not in the left side, its still spaces there
[21:53:05] <Whiskey> if you take mouse over the text
[21:53:21] <Velveeta> jonno_ftw: break up the loop with setTimeouts every N animations to give the browser a chance to do other maintenance tasks like animations
[21:54:02] <Velveeta> whiskey: look at your dom itself… those spans are all trimmed… what whitespace are you trying to trim?
[21:54:58] <Whiskey> as i told you, if you take the mouse over the finger and select the text, in left side you see its still has whitespaces
[21:56:17] <Velveeta> whiskey: you still have the test center aligned… there's no whitespace in the text itself… when i highlight the text, i only see the gutter created by the text alignment
[21:56:27] <Velveeta> text* center aligned
[21:57:15] <Whiskey> ok thats a problem as the finger not in the center, only the text under is, it what i try to slove some way. And thats is the whitespaces
[21:57:44] <Velveeta> well you have no more actual whitespace, as in literal spaces, in your text
[21:57:54] <Velveeta> they've all been trimmed out
[21:58:41] <Whiskey> anyway to trim whitespace in dom?
[21:58:52] <Whiskey> as it is what that is i think
[21:59:18] <Velveeta> well, you need to learn the difference between whitespace and padding/margin… there is no whitespace in what you're seeing
[21:59:31] <Whiskey> no padding ether
[21:59:34] <Velveeta> so you'll probably have to adjust the padding and margin on your containers
[21:59:48] <Whiskey> if you change place on the spans in the pre in html you change place on the element
[22:00:46] <Velveeta> i'm not sure what that means
[22:02:22] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/VRbL5/20/ comare that to this one http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/VRbL5/21/ + whitespace in dom is gone
[22:02:36] <Whiskey> whitout any padding / margin
[22:03:06] <Velveeta> your problem is that you need some literal whitespace at the end of those lines to make those line up properly
[22:03:37] <Velveeta> as of the 9th span, you need to add 4 spaces to the end of each of those lines, and it lines up just fine
[22:04:04] <Velveeta> but since you're trimming all whitespace from those lines, they're lining up wrong because there aren't enough characters in those lower strings to center them properly
[22:06:11] <Whiskey> Velveeta: you do try what i try to get rid of right?
[22:06:19] <Whiskey> "you do get"
[22:06:48] <Velveeta> not really… i know you're trying to get it to align in the center properly, but it was doing that earlier, i'm not sure what you're trying to do right now
[22:08:22] <Whiskey> i think what i try to get rid of is the whitespace in the pre tag
[22:08:30] <Whiskey> as it not the spans
[22:11:31] <Whiskey> it has to be the pre that has whitespace
[22:12:49] <Whiskey> yeh sure it is
[22:13:25] <Whiskey> but trim text not work on that one
[22:13:55] <Velveeta> why are you using a pre anyway? just for the line breaks between spans?
[22:14:20] <Whiskey> Velveeta: the finger will not work, here is what im looking for, but most be a more easy way to do it, http://jsfiddle.net/pjEYm/3/
[22:14:33] <Whiskey> it removes the spaces i try to get rid of
[22:15:15] <Velveeta> what you just showed me has nothing to do with a finger, so when you say "here is what im looking for" i have no clue what you're looking for
[22:15:28] <Whiskey> it has
[22:15:31] <scipy53> Is there any way to add a default value for something like this: $("#criteria-3-score").text()
[22:15:34] <Whiskey> it remove the whitespaces in the pre
[22:15:44] <scipy53> Such that, if its null, then a default value is passed
[22:15:58] <Whiskey> everything in pre looks as it printed, it means if you have whitespace in it it will be that
[22:16:24] <Whiskey> Velveeta: remove the JS code in the example se what happens
[22:16:48] <Whiskey> exactly same that happens for me
[22:16:51] <Velveeta> whiskey: it's only stripping the whitespace at the beginning of the lines, not that at the end, and then it's overwriting its own inner text with the whole array of lines at once
[22:17:10] <Whiskey> yeh and i will also strip whitepsace in the beginning
[22:17:36] <Velveeta> scipy53: if the element is null, or the return from .text() ?
[22:17:48] <scipy53> return from text
[22:18:09] <FriendlySeal> dafuq u newps doion
[22:18:11] <Velveeta> scipy53: you can use the or operator to set a default… $('#criteria-3-score').text() || "your default";
[22:18:24] <scipy53> oh that works?
[22:18:25] <scipy53> neat
[22:18:28] <Velveeta> yep
[22:19:07] <Velveeta> whiskey: so duplicate the code sample you're working from and see what happens, but yours is very different from this one
[22:20:28] <Whiskey> yeh it did not work so good
[22:20:29] <Velveeta> whiskey: this code sample is also left aligned, and uses the first line's whitespace count as its gauge for how much to remove from every other line.. those are different criteria from what you're trying to accomplish
[22:20:33] <FriendlySeal> hmm
[22:20:50] <FriendlySeal> wat
[22:20:54] <Velveeta> what you should be doing is scrapping that pre element altogether, and wrap that finger in divs for line breaks
[22:21:36] <FriendlySeal> sounds about rire
[22:22:02] <Whiskey> Velveeta: but you get what i try to do know?
[22:22:16] <FriendlySeal> hay gaize come sign up to my site
[22:22:22] <FriendlySeal> and paste ur codez
[22:23:49] <Velveeta> whiskey: not anymore than i did before.. i can see that you're trying to center a middle finger in an ascii box, but i don't know why you seem to think you need a pre element to do that
[22:24:22] <Whiskey> Velveeta: remove them
[22:24:25] <Whiskey> what happens?
[22:24:26] <Velveeta> if you just used nested divs inside of another div container, the whitespace wouldn't matter, because the browser would ignore it
[22:24:30] <Velveeta> remove what
[22:24:34] <Whiskey> the pre
[22:24:46] <Velveeta> i know what will happen, you'll be left with a big inline blob of shit
[22:24:57] <Whiskey> yeh right
[22:24:58] <Velveeta> i'm trying to explain to you how to do this properly, but you're hung up on the wrong questions
[22:25:12] <Velveeta> use divs instead of spans, which will provide your line breaks
[22:25:20] <Whiskey> ok
[22:26:18] <Whiskey> tehn?
[22:26:29] <FriendlySeal> comon wat r u waiting for
[22:26:29] <DevePy> if i'm have this json = { 'error':'false',fields:[[{ 'pk':30, 'title':'my exmple' }], {'votes':30, 'can':{1:0,2:3}}]}, how to iterate this
[22:26:31] <FriendlySeal> use divs
[22:26:38] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/VRbL5/22/
[22:27:04] <Whiskey> div can´t handle whitespace in same way
[22:27:15] <Velveeta> whiskey: now change your spaces to nonbreaking spaces, &nbsp;
[22:27:16] <FriendlySeal> DevePy, parse_json()
[22:27:49] <Whiskey> ooo its so uggly :/
[22:27:57] <FriendlySeal> ur mom
[22:28:00] <DevePy> FriendlySeal: this now work, already json
[22:28:15] <FriendlySeal> omfg
[22:28:22] <FriendlySeal> u kno wat parse mean?
[22:28:23] <FriendlySeal> gah
[22:29:30] <DevePy> i'm already parse to json whit Python
[22:30:01] <DevePy> i'm return JSON
[22:30:18] <DevePy> json = {'error':'false',fields:[{'pk':20,'title':'my title'}]}
[22:31:24] <FriendlySeal> so just alert(json.error)
[22:31:36] <DevePy> FriendlySeal: SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character
[22:31:43] <FriendlySeal> omfg
[22:31:48] <Whiskey> Velveeta: think i know why the other way not working :)
[22:31:58] <FriendlySeal> Whiskey, wats not working

[22:32:09] <DevePy> i'm need iterate fields
[22:32:14] <Velveeta> ok, in that case i'll leave it up to you to fix, i'm off to bed

[22:47:54] <FriendlySeal> ok gaize
[22:47:57] <FriendlySeal> srsly now
[22:48:05] <FriendlySeal> im having some issues
[22:48:13] <FriendlySeal> //self.container.hide('slide', {direction: slide_out_dir, complete: function() {
[22:48:14] <FriendlySeal> 					self.container.slideUp('slow', function() {
[22:48:42] <FriendlySeal> see how i comented first slide
[22:49:10] <FriendlySeal> coz its not working on second element
[22:49:22] <FriendlySeal> i have two boxes that slide in and out
[22:49:38] * vinex08 farts..
[22:49:41] <FriendlySeal> but only the first one works w side slide
[22:50:13] <Whiskey> FriendlySeal: do you know how to get rid of this whitespaces?
[22:50:26] <FriendlySeal> yes
[22:50:42] <FriendlySeal> lol.search(/\s+/, "")
[22:50:47] <FriendlySeal> boom
[22:51:06] <Whiskey> well that won´t work
[22:51:14] <FriendlySeal> wat
[22:51:16] <Whiskey> if you look at http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/VRbL5/26/
[22:51:59] <Whiskey> you have span.map(function () {return $(this).text().length; <-- it need to know how many whitespaces that one have, and remove exactly the same count from eatch span
[22:52:23] <FriendlySeal> huh
[22:52:35] <FriendlySeal> i dun wana think rite nau
[22:52:44] <Whiskey> hehe
[22:52:45] <FriendlySeal> i can helpu w programing
[22:52:49] <FriendlySeal> not logic lol
[22:52:52] <Whiskey> if you look at finger
[22:52:56] <Whiskey> i try to center it ok?
[22:53:50] <FriendlySeal> ok umm
[22:53:59] <FriendlySeal> ' '
[22:54:01] <Whiskey> if you look at the html code you see that the span that the text is in is in a pre tag, as i have spaces before i start to write them, them will also be in the HTML i try to remove them
[22:54:04] <FriendlySeal> in html wont work
[22:54:18] <FriendlySeal> it needs to be &nbsp;
[22:54:33] <Whiskey> noooo
[22:54:42] <Whiskey> and not in pre tag thats the problem, its reads it anyways
[22:55:14] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/89pXa/
[22:56:03] <Whiskey> it need to find out how many spaces it is before " <span>some text</span>" starts and remove them
[22:56:55] <Whiskey> maybe it can work whit only little replace
[22:57:27] <FriendlySeal> ok so do
[22:57:35] <FriendlySeal> ok wait
[22:57:50] <FriendlySeal> so
[22:57:55] <FriendlySeal> lets start with one line
[22:58:01] <FriendlySeal> what is its content
[22:58:02] <Uhkis> Whiskey: why are you putting those rows in spans?
[22:58:18] <FriendlySeal> concentrate and lets walk thru this
[22:58:27] <FriendlySeal> dont get all jumbled up
[22:58:47] <FriendlySeal> and yes Uhkis is rite just forget about spans for now
[22:58:51] <FriendlySeal> or any html tags
[22:58:58] <Whiskey> ^[ ]+<span> that will find every space it has in start
[22:59:28] <FriendlySeal> ^\s+
[23:00:50] <Whiskey> yeh but it will find other things then not need to be removed
[23:00:52] <Whiskey> i think
[23:01:03] <FriendlySeal> no
[23:01:25] <Whiskey> FriendlySeal: http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/VRbL5/27/
[23:01:50] <FriendlySeal> remove /g
[23:02:09] <Whiskey> yeh
[23:02:24] <Whiskey> but it still need / as delimeter
[23:02:41] <FriendlySeal> yes
[23:02:49] <Whiskey> but still broken
[23:03:44] <FriendlySeal> wait dood
[23:03:53] <FriendlySeal> pre.(text)?
[23:05:37] <FriendlySeal> pre.text()
[23:06:13] <FriendlySeal> aaaaaand
[23:06:21] <FriendlySeal> looking by ur pre.text
[23:06:23] <Whiskey> yeh still not removed
[23:06:24] <FriendlySeal> its actualy html
[23:06:37] <FriendlySeal> aaaaaan
[23:07:05] <FriendlySeal> its actually pre.html().children.each()
[23:07:07] <Whiskey> FriendlySeal: http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/VRbL5/30/ look at that
[23:07:45] <Whiskey> its need to find what widthest " | =-= =-= =-= =-= |) )" <-- in this case that one and find out how many whitespace it is in there and remove it from every line
[23:07:58] <Whiskey> i know its 6 whitespaces
[23:10:46] <FriendlySeal> wow dood
[23:10:56] <FriendlySeal> ur not thinking properly
[23:11:45] <FriendlySeal> var lines = $(".dataViewBox-Data pre span");
[23:12:27] <Whiskey> noo it can´t be in the span
[23:12:32] <Whiskey> it has to be in the pre
[23:12:44] <Whiskey> so you see the whitespaces as them are in the PRE tag and not SPAN tags
[23:14:16] <FriendlySeal> ok so u want?
[23:14:27] <FriendlySeal> the white spaces in span tags
[23:14:32] <Whiskey> no in PRE
[23:14:38] <FriendlySeal> and move them outside
[23:14:40] <FriendlySeal> ?
[23:14:42] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/VRbL5/33/ look in the console
[23:14:47] <Whiskey> do you see the finger there??
[23:14:51] <Whiskey> And do you see all whitespaces?
[23:15:20] <FriendlySeal> <span>         _  | --- |  _</span>
[23:15:27] <FriendlySeal> its in the span
[23:15:44] <FriendlySeal> so span.text()
[23:15:46] <FriendlySeal> is ur string
[23:16:31] <Whiskey> http://snag.gy/9SD2W.jpg
[23:16:41] <Whiskey> all is correct
[23:17:58] <Whiskey> http://snag.gy/vo7vY.jpg <-- see the lines i wrote in that one?
[23:19:31] <Whiskey> that are the widthest point in that ascii and it has 6 spaces, so somehow it need to find out that is widthest point, count the spaces in this case 6 of them, loop again and remove 6 spaces from etch line done
[23:21:07] <Whiskey> FriendlySeal: get it?
[23:25:37] <FriendlySeal> omg dood
[23:25:50] <FriendlySeal> trust me i can do this in a snap
[23:25:57] <Whiskey> snap?
[23:26:10] <FriendlySeal> look
[23:26:12] <FriendlySeal> http://noteys.com/media/users/photo/72/shotgun.png
[23:26:26] <Whiskey> lol
[23:26:30] <FriendlySeal> see the text there thats all quads
[23:26:39] <FriendlySeal> its freetype lib
[23:26:42] <Whiskey> Well you welcome to show me as i can´t find out how to do it exactly
[23:26:45] <FriendlySeal> every1 has to align it
[23:26:56] <FriendlySeal> plus
[23:26:59] <FriendlySeal> its not just white space
[23:27:10] <FriendlySeal> its actual measurements in offsets
[23:27:30] <Whiskey> the output show the whitespaces i need to delete anyways so it most be on right way
[23:28:13] <FriendlySeal> just to delete the space?
[23:28:20] <FriendlySeal> in front
[23:28:23] <Whiskey> yeh
[23:28:32] <FriendlySeal> so wats ur problem
[23:28:35] <FriendlySeal> its like i told u

[23:28:37] <FriendlySeal> dum ass
[23:28:41] <FriendlySeal> omfg

[23:28:59] <FriendlySeal> use lol.replace(^
[23:29:11] <FriendlySeal> its replace
[23:29:22] <Whiskey> it won´t know how many space to remove how many times do i need to tell you it needs to know how many

[23:53:52] <Whiskey> strange that this don´t work t = t.replace(/^ /g, "")
[23:54:15] <lo_o|> Whiskey, just replace wont work

[23:54:29] <lo_o|> foreach whitespace
[23:54:38] <lo_o|> w == ' '
[23:54:45] <Whiskey> ?

[23:57:31] <Whiskey> not fallow
[23:57:40] <lo_o|> then u cant do this
[23:57:47] <lo_o|> its like C coding
[23:58:05] <Whiskey> i have use replace before it should work as it take it line by line
[23:58:09] <Whiskey> but it won´t replace a thing
[23:58:22] <Whiskey> no wait
