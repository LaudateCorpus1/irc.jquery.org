[01:05:38] <Cork> events has information if they are user generated or fake events, so there isn't a problem by letting script fire event on none visible elements
[01:06:10] <Cork> for element that has default actions (mainly links) the default action is sometimes not triggered if the event is fake
[04:56:02] <mrC71> Hi, how to wait for function 1 to fire before 2: https://jsfiddle.net/bek63Ljc/
[19:04:40] <jnewt> data = $('#myForm').serializeJSON(); $.post("/my/endpoint",JSON.stringify(data) , but i need to format one field from the form.   its type="date" and i want to send it as RFC3339 format so i don't have to do a bunch of manual parsing on the back end.   is this possible?  format that I want shown is just MM/DD/YYY which is already working fine.
[19:27:32] <robertmaxrees> jnewt you'll have an easier time doing that server-side.,
[19:27:57] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'll have to do all that manual parsing on the client :)

[21:38:40] <archstanton7890[> How can I change my password? Or, send my TZ to a new wallet I created, and wrote dwn the p/w?
[21:38:42] <robertmaxrees> wrong channel?
[21:39:10] <archstanton7890[> sorry, what channel do I want?
[21:39:25] <robertmaxrees> no clue - this is a support channel for a javascript library :)
[21:39:59] <archstanton7890[> ok, again, sorry, thanx for ur time
[21:40:06] <robertmaxrees> all good :)
[23:53:20] <pavonia> archstanton7890[: Try ##cryptocurrency. (If you still got the seed, you probably don't need the password)
