[18:23:15] <admin123> I'm rendering an anchor tag like this https://datatables.net/reference/option/columns.render#Examples how can I get a .click handler to register correctly on this?
[18:23:30] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener.
[18:23:53] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events and https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ have everything you need to know.
[18:25:57] <robertmaxrees> admin123 ^
[18:26:34] <admin123> yeah let me try tit
[18:26:37] <admin123> it
[18:32:34] <admin123> nice it works
[18:32:48] <admin123> just have to place it on the table and not on the generated tds inside
[18:32:54] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:33:16] <robertmaxrees> because, as the docs explain, you have to bind it to whatever ancestor exists at the time of binding
[18:37:48] <admin123> could this be used to extend the search? https://datatables.net/reference/api/search() I need to add extra checkboxes to specify booleans in the api search
[18:37:59] <robertmaxrees> not sure i follow.
[18:38:20] <robertmaxrees> all .on() does is bind event listeners.
[18:39:56] <admin123> it's more a datatable question I think, whether the search callback can be overriden so I can extend it
[18:43:10] <admin123> here they seem to do a client-side search https://github.com/izimobil/django-rest-framework-datatables/blob/master/example/albums/templates/albums/albums.html#L76
[18:44:15] <robertmaxrees> ok?

[18:44:24] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[18:44:50] <robertmaxrees> looks like you just specify the ajax property in the datatables init.
