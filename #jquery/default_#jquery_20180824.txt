[05:19:11] <fn> hello, i'm not 100% sure if it's a jquery related question or not: have a iframe (X) on a site (A), when i click on anywhere on A all future interactions on X are disabled.
[05:19:16] <fn> any idea what it could be?
[05:21:29] <pavonia> What kind of interactions?
[05:23:14] <fn> have a multi-step form inside the iframe with some links. i have to click multiple times on something inside the iframe until it works correctly
[05:24:19] <fn> and this happens only on mobile device (iphone)
[05:26:02] <pavonia> Hard to tell, could be some focus problem where the focus is pushed back to A every time
[05:26:42] <destramic> hey guys im using signature pad and implimented a prototype function to remove blanks white which i found on thier git...probably is the canvas is white when you save it so its no removing blanks http://jsfiddle.net/nk6uewf8/
[05:26:58] <destramic> how can i get output signature to be white bg please?
[12:20:42] <jquery225> im trying to make a simple dialog plugin but the plugin wont bind to 2 elements can someone tell me where ive gone wrong please? http://jsfiddle.net/v9p0aneL/
[12:56:12] <jquery225> can anyone help please?
[13:12:04] <taplar> jquery225: make sure none of your variables are global scoped
[13:16:34] <jquery225> taplar: sorry how do you mean like $vars
[13:17:25] <jquery225> i think this may be the problem var $trigger = $(this);
[13:20:53] <taplar> there's also the issue that you're binding multiple click handlers to the dialog for different elements
[13:21:02] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/v9p0aneL/1/
[13:21:23] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/v9p0aneL/2/
[13:21:33] <taplar> so if you do one of the modal clicks, it does the logic for both of them
[13:28:37] <Samian> hi
[13:29:31] <Samian> anyone know of a file loader tool I can add to my website so clients can easily upload large zips of images instead of splitting them across multiple emails?
[13:29:54] <robertmaxrees> "a file loader tool"?
[13:30:00] <Samian> uploader
[13:30:16] <robertmaxrees> <input type="file">
[13:31:55] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:33:55] <Rockwood> i have issue in add jquery in head
[13:34:02] <robertmaxrees> ij'
[13:34:04] <robertmaxrees> *ok
[13:36:54] <robertmaxrees> Rockwood did you need help or...? :)
[13:37:20] <Rockwood> actually i have established jquery in head but when i am making a function in body its throwing error
[13:37:35] <robertmaxrees> what's the error?
[13:38:00] <Rockwood> startquiz.js:1 Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[13:38:15] <Rockwood> how its is possible?
[13:38:22] <robertmaxrees> could be a few things.
[13:38:33] <Rockwood> like?
[13:38:33] <robertmaxrees> 1 - are you sure your jquery load isn't 404ing?
[13:38:42] <robertmaxrees> 2 - are you loading jquery more than once?
[13:38:50] <robertmaxrees> 3 - are you running noconflict mode?
[13:41:05] <Rockwood> your 2 point is aviable in my case --> https://kopy.io/lFkXZ
[13:42:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah, don't do that.
[13:42:07] <robertmaxrees> load it once.
[13:43:06] <Rockwood> but my few thing running by old version so can't remove it
[13:43:55] <robertmaxrees> then you need to fix them.
[13:44:09] <robertmaxrees> running multiple copies of jquery will cause problems.
[13:44:52] <Rockwood> you are right i have to see proper solution
[13:47:30] <Rockwood> thanks
[13:47:44] <robertmaxrees> rad
[14:20:28] <halftroll> Hello!
[14:21:09] <halftroll> $.site = {} <- is this some sort of standard
[14:21:42] <halftroll> can't find where $.site.run is being executed
[14:23:05] <taplar> {} is just an empty object there
[14:24:59] <halftroll> oh, it's $.site = $.site || {};
[14:26:39] <halftroll> taplar: thanks!!!!
[14:26:47] <taplar> np
[14:35:53] <halftroll> there's jQuery.site = { run: .....
[14:36:05] <halftroll> I am trying to findout how is it that this run gets executed
[14:36:14] <halftroll> I grep jQuery.site and get nothing :[
[14:36:23] <robertmaxrees> probably $.site
[14:37:01] <robertmaxrees> or grep for run(
[14:41:37] <halftroll> going to grep run( in the html
[14:43:19] <taplar> i'd probably just try to search for $.site.run in the entire project
[14:43:35] <robertmaxrees> ^ or this.
[14:53:11] <halftroll> Ok, found it!
[14:53:42] <halftroll> Site.run(); being executed inside all layouts
[14:53:55] <halftroll> and window.App = Site.extend({ in site.js

[15:25:24] <Samian> anyon know of a way to setup a client portal so clients can easily upload files and access all the files they've uploaded?
[15:25:52] <robertmaxrees> that's all pretty basic stuff.
[15:30:55] <Samian> setting up a file uploader?
[15:33:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  that's what input type="file" is for.
[17:12:42] <Samian> anyone know of a good client portal CMS for uploading files/folders and allowing clients to see the files/folders they uploaded?
[17:13:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:13:33] <robertmaxrees> Samian you're gonna have to be more specific.
[17:13:39] <robertmaxrees> uploading and listing files is easy.
[17:13:40] <taplar> and it's off topic for the room
[17:13:46] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:15:11] <robertmaxrees> that's the third time you've asked that question today and i've given you responses each time.  why are you ignoring my advice?
[17:19:33] <Samian> taplar what's a channel in which my question is on topic? I don't like being off topic
[17:19:46] <taplar> #web probably
[17:19:48] <Samian> robertmaxrees let me scroll up
[17:20:25] <Samian> [18:08:24:11:28] <robertmaxrees> <input type="file"> <--- I'm not a web programmer. I can't believe it's that easy
[17:23:27] <robertmaxrees> so instead of responding you just ignored me?
[17:23:39] <Samian> I'm not ignore you robertmaxrees
[17:23:51] <Samian> thank you for what you wrote
[17:23:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:24:02] <Samian> I appreciate ideas, suggestions, thoughts, and everything else
[17:24:23] <Samian> It's not like I'm paying you for your time, so whatever you say I'm thankful that you give me any of your time
[17:24:30] <ceramicskull> lol
[17:25:19] <ceramicskull> I can't imagine this guy in ##javascript where they ignore questions xD
[17:25:33] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:26:44] <ceramicskull> Just saying I've seen the js channel just gloss over the "easy" questions
[18:51:26] <jquery225> why wont my plugin initialize please? http://jsfiddle.net/nhv72qxr/
