[01:48:01] <Woet> so you expect us to learn Spanish for you and then debug code for you?
[01:48:10] <linurandy> sorry
[01:48:22] <linurandy> forgott
[01:48:35] <Woet> why dont you start with an English test case demonstrating your issue on www.jsfiddle.net
[01:49:27] <linurandy> i've it this is the url https://jsbin.com/simepiy/edit?html,js,console,output
[01:50:08] <linurandy> but the problem is that the datatable i think don't read the json really
[01:51:24] <Woet> linurandy: please dont private message people before asking.
[01:51:41] <Woet> linurandy: and please make it a working test case.
[01:51:48] <Woet> linurandy: in English, as I asked.

[02:01:32] <Woet> such as [07:48:34]  <Woet>	why dont you start with an English test case demonstrating your issue on www.jsfiddle.net
[02:01:44] <linurandy> is about that
[02:02:39] <linurandy> can i?
[02:05:12] <linurandy> hey are you there?
[02:07:27] <linurandy> i'm in china and i can't access to the google service, for that i can't create an account
[02:20:43] <Cork> linurandy: https://jsfiddle.net/6ojzhqt6/ looks fine to me, what is the problem?
[02:21:09] <Cork> and also there isn't json there only javascript arrays and objects
[02:50:31] <linurandy> there is in jbin https://jsbin.com/razodiriku/edit?html,output
[06:58:22] <touson> I am trying to detect the window scroll position on mobile so I can stick my header to the top of the device viewport
[06:58:52] <touson> My $(window).scroll event works fine on desktop and I can console.log the window scroll position, no probs
[06:59:24] <touson> When I change Chrome to emulate a mobile device, I have to scroll the webpage approximately 50px before the window.scroll event kicks in!?
[06:59:42] <touson> Presumably this is to take into account the browsers address bar on a mobile device?
[06:59:49] <touson> Anyone got any workarounds for this?
[07:49:20] <Cork> touson: scroll events are async on mobile browsers (and is going in that direction for desktop too) so you should avoid using it for positioning elements if possible
[07:49:39] <Cork> touson: do you want the bar to constantly be at the top? if so use position: fixed;
[07:49:56] <Cork> touson: if you want it to stick when the user scrolls past it, have a look at position: sticky;
[07:50:19] <touson> Thanks Cork
[07:50:36] <touson> I need to detect when the screen has been scrolled so I can make changes to the size of the header elements
[07:50:46] <Cork> touson: also there are an intersectionObserver that is meant to replace scroll events for detecting element position
[07:51:02] <Cork> it isn't well supported in browser yet, but it is the future
[07:51:31] <fn> is position: sticky; supported yet?
[07:51:52] <Cork> if you exclude edge it is quite well supported
[07:52:18] <Cork> and you can have a less nice but onscroll based fallback if it isn't supported
[07:52:23] <Cork> it is easy enough to detect
[07:52:42] <Cork> touson: this might be of interest https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/sticky-headers
[07:53:18] * touson is humbled in the glow of Corks greatness
[07:53:39] <Cork> though be warned intersectionObserver is very new and not well supported yet
[07:53:58] <Cork> but it is still interesting read for the future i think
[07:55:02] <fn> 3 weeks ago i build own sticky-header :x
[07:55:09] <Cork> touson: the greatness comes from me having to deal with this just a few weeks ago so :P
[07:55:31] <Cork> i built my own sticky headers a few times over the last few years
[07:55:44] <Cork> but if you want to support all edge cases it is quite tricky
[07:55:46] <fn> i hate sticky headers.
[07:56:00] <Cork> (specifically horizontal scroll)
[07:56:02] <fn> deleted hole process for my site
[07:56:25] <Cork> ya, i just use position: sticky; now days and if you don't support it; well scroll up
[07:57:16] <Cork> when you have to trigger on resize and onscroll to move a position: fixed element to have it fit correctly on the screen things start to be very annoying
[07:58:29] <Cork> what surprises me is how few of the sticky js libs out there actually handles horizontal scrolls
[07:58:45] <Cork> (i've found one this far)
[08:04:15] <touson> Thanks again Cork, very helpful
[08:04:22] <Cork> np
[10:15:37] <sigdk> Hello, does this return make any sense: function foobar() {   return $.ajax({  ... });  }    Does it return a promise maybe?
[10:27:06] <touson> sigdk: No it would return a handle to the jQuery ajax object
[10:27:53] <Cork> uh actually it does return a promise
[10:28:16] <Cork> sigdk: and yes to both questions, it makes sense and it is a promise
[10:28:20] <touson> Running function foobar() {return $.ajax();}console.log(foobar()); in the console output the ajax object?
[10:28:39] <Cork> it will give you a jqxhr object
[10:28:58] <Cork> it is not the xhr object
[10:30:23] <Cork> function foobar(url) { return $.ajax(url, { type: "post", data: { value: "something" } }) }; foobar("/test").done(function(response) { console.log(response); });
[10:30:46] <Cork> is perfectly valid and working code (and by design, it is much of the point why jquery has deferred)
[10:30:55] <touson> My bad
[10:33:02] <sigdk> Cork, "it is much of the point why jquery has deferred"  what does this mean?
[10:33:22] * Cork creates a jsfiddle
[10:37:09] <Cork> sigdk: does this answer your question? https://jsfiddle.net/bw9mjm5e/
[10:47:30] <sigdk> Cork, what is the difference to this: https://jsfiddle.net/bw9mjm5e/2/   ?
[10:48:19] <sigdk> actually I dont understand why mine works?  "from local done <h1>something</h1>"  <---- This shouldn't be printed
[10:48:40] <Cork> sigdk: none except you can have a local handler of the response
[10:49:16] <Cork> in /2/ if you wanted to get the response data you would have to add a callback argument or similar to the foobar function
[10:49:30] <Cork> and call it with response for the click handler to get access to the date
[10:49:32] <Cork> *data
[10:50:42] <Cork> sigdk: and you can combine them if you like, that is perfectly fine too
[10:51:09] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/bw9mjm5e/4/
[10:51:29] <Cork> if i can actually copy and paste correctly...
[10:51:40] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/bw9mjm5e/5/
[11:05:14] <sigdk> Cork, is always the "from shared done ..." printed first?
[11:06:55] <dimi1947> have you any idea to what plugin might this code belong to?
[11:07:01] <dimi1947> https://hastebin.com/ovekizemod.js
[11:07:47] <dimi1947> it seems that i have accidentally delete the file of the plugin(a long time ago) and I cannot remember which plugin is it
[11:15:20] <Uhkis> dimi1947: looks like jquery ui
[11:31:18] <dimi1947> Uhkis:I agree
[13:00:57] <grapheti> so quiet :/
[13:01:11] * grapheti dances
[13:01:47] * taplar shoveling fries into his mouth
[13:04:10] <guideX> you can disable an input with jquery, but not an a
[13:04:50] <robertmaxrees> hrmmm?
[13:04:54] <taplar> could probably turn click events off for them
[13:04:56] <guideX> so if you have something like this, <a href="#" class="cmdNext button button-3d button-rounded button-reveal tright button-large"><i class="icon-forward"></i><span>Next</span></a> it becomes quite difficult to properly disable
[13:05:10] <robertmaxrees> define "properly"
[13:05:42] <guideX> to me, it should say disabled /> or perhaps disabled="disabled" which causes you not to be able to click it or hover over it to invoke the animation
[13:05:51] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m22tzn6u/
[13:05:55] <robertmaxrees> there's a css tweak for that.
[13:06:13] <guideX> oh cool, i'll try it, thanks
[13:10:02] <guideX> yeah that works good enough. I can still tab to it and click, but who's gonna do that
[13:10:48] <taplar> maybe people with accessibility needs?
[13:12:17] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:12:29] <robertmaxrees> though now i gotta ask
[13:12:38] <robertmaxrees> why are you using an <a> in that case?
[13:12:43] <guideX> seems best https://pastebin.com/raw/X5qSsUje
[13:12:58] <guideX> robertmaxrees: because that way, I have an animation when the user hovers over the button
[13:13:11] <guideX> if I use an input, I must close it, then it doesn't animate correctly
[13:13:13] <robertmaxrees> guideX you said you don't want the animation
[13:13:21] <guideX> well I don't want it, if it's disabled etc
[13:13:31] <robertmaxrees> and any element can support hover.
[13:14:09] <robertmaxrees> <a> is used for hyperlinking.  if you're not linking to something, why use it?
[13:14:54] <taplar> side note, iirc you can combine those css() calls into one if you use an {} notation
[13:15:02] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:15:08] <robertmaxrees> or just use a class.
[13:15:14] <taplar> tru dat
[13:54:12] <hellyeah> o/
[14:03:00] <VedderJS> Am i using this pattern ok? https://gist.github.com/adavia/6bacdd3cc288cb1ba1cf3d27e65548ee
[14:03:29] <VedderJS> Trying to follow the module pattern jquery suggests
[14:09:42] <taplar> VedderJS: looks fine syntatically
[14:09:52] <taplar> though line 20 is an error
[14:09:56] <taplar> *logical
[14:10:51] <VedderJS> what do you mean?
[14:15:27] <robertmaxrees> what is "this.hash" supposed to be?
[14:19:41] <VedderJS> robertmaxrees: the clicked link
[14:37:02] <taplar> $() is always truthy
[14:37:23] <taplar> it returns a jQuery object whither something is found or not
[14:51:23] <grapheti> whither/weather/whether
[14:51:34] <taplar> i never know
[14:51:39] <grapheti> sam fam
[14:52:25] <taplar> i have a large vernacular of word by which to fk up
[14:52:38] <grapheti> LOL
[14:52:55] <taplar> *words
[14:53:05] <taplar> case n point
[14:53:09] <grapheti> Are you native?
[14:53:15] <taplar> racist...
[14:53:17] <grapheti> :D
[14:53:35] <grapheti> prolly a hebrew
[14:53:47] <taplar> yeah, engles is my native language
[14:54:26] <grapheti> language changes so much
[14:54:57] * taplar is laughing
[14:55:08] <taplar> you know i hear a lot of insults around
[14:55:24] <taplar> but 'probably a hebrew' is really uncommon, lol
[14:55:32] <grapheti> LMAO
[14:55:49] <grapheti> I put that TEAM AMERICA mix on it
[14:56:39] <taplar> oh snap
[14:57:01] <taplar> that could actually be taken as antisemitic.  *eyes graph*
[14:57:21] <taplar> bad grapheti, bad!
[14:57:49] <grapheti> lol, I know someone from Israel that's in here :D
[15:29:59] <Es0teric> lets say i have var someVar = [1,2,3].pop(); does it remove 3 from the array or does it return it as the only value in someVar?
[15:30:31] <taplar> both
[15:31:17] <Es0teric> ok then i want it to just return 3
[15:31:26] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/c8brac4m/
[15:31:29] <Es0teric> oh wait thats what i want then
[15:32:20] <grapheti> pop and drop it
[15:32:20] <Es0teric> dopeeeee
[15:32:20] <Es0teric> thanks man
[15:32:53] <grapheti> SourPls
[15:50:29] <newb007> Does anyone work with es6?
[15:52:16] <taplar> what's your q?
[15:53:05] <taplar> you might also ask ##javascript
[15:54:00] <newb007> I'm using laravel mix to compile it but I was wondering when it's compiled if older browser would still read the js.
[15:54:26] <taplar> you're compiling ES6 to ES5?
[15:55:08] <newb007> uhhh, I thought I was just compiling es6.
[15:55:12] <newb007> I'm really new to it.
[15:55:26] <taplar> es6 is just a new version of javascript implementation
[15:55:38] <taplar> you don't have to compile it
[15:56:22] <taplar> it works like normal javascript.  you only 'compile' it if you are converting it to ES5 for compatibility while ES6 browser coverage is growing
[15:56:28] <taplar> afaik
[15:57:05] <newb007> Okay.  So I guess the compiling is just merging multipe js files into one.  I just noticed that if I try to run the site in IE7 it break.
[15:57:43] <taplar> you can hit http://caniuse.com/ to see what things you are using in ES6 that are not IE7 compatible
[15:58:05] <taplar> but IE7 is pretty old
[15:58:45] <taplar> so it looks like 'let', 'const', and '=>' are not supported in IE7
[15:58:55] <taplar> for a few things
[15:59:03] <newb007> That's my issue then.  I'm using let so I will switch back to var.
[15:59:41] <taplar> If you are using a build system to package your scripts, I'd suggest looking into a conversion process like babel
[16:00:08] <newb007> Okay.  Thanks
[16:00:25] <taplar> you can use it so that you write your code in ES6, it converts it to ES5, and then as time goes on and you don't have to support browsers (or version) that don't support it, you can convert less and less, but your code base will still be in ES6
[16:00:44] <taplar> https://babeljs.io/
[16:01:13] <newb007> Awesome taplar thanks for the help.
[16:01:17] <taplar> np
[16:03:53] <grapheti> https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/
[16:07:07] <newb007> taplar that solved me issue.  Thanks again
[16:07:15] <taplar> sure

[17:32:36] <z1haze> if you append one jquery object to another does it automatically append the html?
[17:35:41] <taplar> it adds the element as a child
[17:42:14] <SideFX> Whats the best way to send a complete  html page as a variable to an ajax call?
[17:42:27] <taplar> why would you want to do that?
[17:43:24] <SideFX> I need to pass html to an API for creating faxes
[17:44:01] <taplar> the entire page or just the body?
[17:44:12] <SideFX> Enter page, need CSS links and stuff
[17:44:20] <SideFX> entire, not enter
[17:45:20] <taplar> you could use document.head.innerHTML and document.body.innerHTML
[17:45:26] <taplar> not sure if there is one that gets both at once
[17:46:27] <SideFX> Well I need a different html page than what I'm running
[17:46:37] <taplar> ?
[17:46:59] <SideFX> I'm using PHP To put the HTML into a vairable, I I have <?php $wholepage ?>
[17:47:18] <SideFX> That will give me all the html, I just need to make a jquery/javascript variable hold all the info
[17:47:53] <taplar> you could stick it inside a <template> or <script type="text/template">
[17:48:02] <SideFX> But if I try to make it equal '<?php echo $variable?>'  All the "'s and 's in html mess it up
[17:49:44] <SideFX> Can I do <script type"text/template id="whatever">html</script> and then just use $("#whatever").html() as the variable?
[17:49:54] <taplar> yep
[17:50:01] <SideFX> Interesting, let me give that a try
[17:52:42] <SideFX> Cool that worked, thanks for the solution
[18:34:07] <acxty> Hi all. I am moving a website from a server to an aws ec2. I have several lines like this $('#Searcher').delayKeyup(function(){ SearchTableRows(); }, 1000); No code has been change just copy paste. Now I am getting error that function delayKeyup doesn't exist
[18:51:00] <marcisb> Hello everyone
[18:51:14] <marcisb> I have big problems in learning ajax
[18:51:39] <taplar> sup?
[18:53:04] <marcisb> For example i have class in html elements
[18:53:45] <marcisb> I will post code and mark places what confuses me ok
[18:53:46] <marcisb> ?
[18:53:51] <marcisb> which lines
[18:55:10] <marcisb> https://pastebin.com/AqhQQNHZ in line 10 how it knows which item is clicked from .del class selector when i have 10 elements with class. del
[18:55:46] <taplar> 'this' is bound as the element that was clicked
[18:56:11] <marcisb> Its not $(¨.del¨) ?
[18:56:14] <taplar> no
[18:56:27] <marcisb> Ok thank you very much
[18:56:52] <taplar> optionally you could pass in 'e' to that click handler, which would be the event object, and e.target would also be the element clicked
[18:58:22] <marcisb> taplar Than you very much about support.
[18:58:44] <taplar> np
[18:59:03] <taplar> night all
[19:00:32] <marcisb> Good night you too
[22:33:18] <poboy> jeez.  i'm watching tutorials on pluralsight.com and after learning that .live was deprecated I'm learning about .delegate.  Then I go to http://api.jquery.com/delegate/ and find .delegate has been deprecated
