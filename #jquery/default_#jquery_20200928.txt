[11:19:03] <kittonian> hi all. i have this jquery accordion (not jquery UI) working almost perfectly but there are two major issues I am trying to solve. 1. If part of the accordion is open and I click a link in the content, I do not want the accordion to close. 2. The last accordion opens different than all the others (not as smooth) and I can't figure out why. I created a fiddle and would love some help. https://jsfiddle.net/kittonian/z3v5r7qk/
[14:13:38] <Batzy> $("body > center > div.alert.alert-dismissible.alert-danger > p").val() = "hiya"; does anyone know why this would be throwing "invalid left hand assignment"
[14:13:40] <Batzy> ?
[14:13:58] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jz1csau2/ no error here?
[14:14:04] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[14:14:15] <robertmaxrees> $("body > center > div.alert.alert-dismissible.alert-danger > p").val("hiya");
[14:14:28] <Batzy> that just doesnt update the text
[14:14:40] <Batzy> i dont think it every did
[14:14:42] <Batzy> ever*
[14:14:44] <robertmaxrees> is it an input element?
[14:14:49] <Batzy> no
[14:14:53] <robertmaxrees> then you want .text()
[14:14:57] <robertmaxrees> .val() is for inputs
[14:15:11] <Batzy> ok then what do i use for <p>
[14:15:15] <robertmaxrees> .text()
[14:15:23] <Batzy> got it
[14:15:25] <robertmaxrees> always .text() for everything but inputs.
[14:15:25] <Batzy> ty
[14:15:28] <robertmaxrees> sure
[16:01:14] <grid_> i have heads like <h1>Inleiding</h1> <h2>Some other title</h2> <h3>More more</h3> and i wanna insert automatically id's like for example, <h2 id='someotheritle'>Some other title</h2>, is this easy generate? e.g. the space's to remove and the caps to lowercase
[16:06:48] <robertmaxrees> pretty trivial, though I gotta ask...
[16:06:49] <robertmaxrees> why?
[16:09:21] <robertmaxrees> grid_
[16:10:14] <grid_> i wanna make secton id's to jump to like a TOC
[16:10:19] <robertmaxrees> ah gotcha.
[16:11:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah, super simple - just gotta do .text().replace(' ', '').toLowerCase();
[16:11:15] <robertmaxrees> or do it server-side.
[16:12:13] <grid_> i found this, but first i need id's https://gist.github.com/simov/4b4cfefa1bf0e5f0c359f7635326fa06
[16:12:30] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[16:12:34] <robertmaxrees> not sure what the question is now.
[16:12:57] <robertmaxrees> just told you how to handle the text to lowercased no-space version...
[16:13:28] <grid_> yes, that's what i need too
[16:13:43] <robertmaxrees> lol ok.
[16:14:05] <robertmaxrees> fwiw that gist is... non-ideal.
[16:14:42] <grid_> i need to add the id's to the head tags with it's name
[16:14:56] <robertmaxrees> yep - you've made that clear :)
[16:15:18] <grid_> probably i need to loop a document for that first
[16:15:48] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[16:15:52] <robertmaxrees> $("h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6") - just do this.
[16:16:03] <robertmaxrees> or $(":header")
[16:16:22] <grid_> i have several headers that i have the same name
[16:16:34] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:16:39] <robertmaxrees> you mean the same text?
[16:16:47] <grid_> yes can be
[16:16:49] <grid_> it's mixed
[16:17:00] <robertmaxrees> then you'll need to add logic to check.
[16:17:03] <grid_> no, not the same text, otherwise the section will not match
[16:17:14] <robertmaxrees> then what do you mean "name"?
[16:17:45] <grid_> the name of the id is based on the content of the html tag
[16:17:48] <grid_> which i mean by name
[16:17:58] <grid_> in this case the head tag
[16:18:01] <robertmaxrees> so the id is based on the text of a heading
[16:18:18] <robertmaxrees> (name is confusing here since that's an attribute)
[16:18:30] <robertmaxrees> so what's the specific issue?
[16:21:33] <grid_> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41194464/dynamically-add-id-to-header-based-on-header-name
[16:21:48] <robertmaxrees> ??
[16:22:13] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: looks pretty straightforward - not clear on what your question is lol.
[16:22:15] <grid_> this does what i need actually
[16:22:21] <robertmaxrees> cool
[16:22:21] <grid_> :)
[17:52:49] <francois23> hello?
[17:53:05] <robertmaxrees> hello
[18:04:13] <robertmaxrees> lol welp.
[18:20:49] <francois23> oh hi
[18:22:01] <robertmaxrees> how can we help you francois23 ?
