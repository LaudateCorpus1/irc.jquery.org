[00:01:36] <doug65536> unnotused: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/7dE4u/23/
[00:02:15] <unnotused> lol
[00:02:24] <unnotused> Wow doug
[00:03:43] <unnotused> imma edit this up a bit
[00:03:44] <doug65536> unnotused: a little more visual feedback for editable elements http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/7dE4u/24/
[00:03:46] <sammich> it's really
[00:03:47] <unnotused> but wow
[00:04:01] <sammich> really bothers me how it turns into an input box and the font changes
[00:04:16] <sammich> can we use contenteditable, plz? :D
[00:19:16] <doug65536> unnotused: added way to add a page http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/7dE4u/26/
[00:19:55] <doug65536> jquery is awesome
[00:21:39] <doug65536> bugfixes http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/7dE4u/28/
[00:24:06] <doug65536> unnotused: in a real application, I would typically assign negative ids to new things, then the server can see that they are new when it updates the database. my response would have a mapping from the negative temporary ids to the id it assigned when it inserted it
[00:25:59] <doug65536> unnotused: then, my delete page button can see if it has a negative id, and just discard it. if it has a positive id, I would update the pageChanges to submit something that tells the server to delete it
[00:42:33] <jop008> how do I align text vertical middle? I tried this td valign='middle'><div style='text-align:center;'>" + cselect + "</div></td>"
[00:42:39] <jop008> but no way
[00:43:06] <doug65536> jop008: depends. line-height: 100% might do it
[00:43:37] <doug65536> jop008: I would need to see more of the surrounding markup to know
[00:44:07] <jop008> okay
[00:44:42] <doug65536> jop008: to center a div in its parent, do: left: 50%; top: 50%; transform: translate(-50%,-50%)
[00:45:28] <jop008> ugly code for onliy valign=center
[00:45:43] <doug65536> use valign=center then
[00:45:49] <doug65536> it's middle btw
[00:45:55] <jop008> but it wont work
[00:46:20] <jop008> maybe because I have a div in my td
[00:47:22] <jop008> I have it like this "<td valign='middle'>" + cselect + "</td>";
[00:47:32] <jop008> but no valign center
[00:47:54] <jop008> why is valign not working like this?
[00:48:20] <doug65536> valign is obsolete. use css
[00:52:11] <jop008> solved like this
[00:52:12] <jop008>     var cclass  = "style='text-align:center;vertical-align: middle;'";
[00:52:24] <jop008> not possible to put it in a style sheet
[00:52:53] <doug65536> jop008: why is it not possible
[00:52:56] <jop008> the td code is this <td + cclass ……
[00:53:36] <sammich> display:table-cell;vertical-align:middle
[00:54:14] <sammich> isn't valign deprecated?
[00:56:08] <doug65536> sammich: yes
[01:01:11] <sammich> jop008_ jop008 http://jsfiddle.net/8bD56/
[01:47:26] <ravenzz> is there anybody out there?
[01:51:47] <sammich> I'm afraid you just have us
[01:55:43] <x-finite> http://pastebin.com/0qGTBpLj if a non-numeric character is entered for inputDay/inputMonth/inputYear then the result for age will always be non-numeric?
[01:56:35] <sammich> you need validation
[01:56:35] <x-finite> js> var birthDay=5; var birthMonth=10; var age=birthDay*birthMmonth; print (age);
[01:56:41] <b-ot> x-finite: No output.
[01:56:55] <x-finite> js> var birthDay=5; var birthMonth=10; var age=birthDay*birthMonth; print (age);
[01:57:00] <b-ot> x-finite: 50
[01:57:07] <x-finite> js> var birthDay=5; var birthMonth=10a; var age=birthDay*birthMonth; print (age);
[01:57:12] <b-ot> x-finite: No output.
[01:57:21] <x-finite> js> var birthDay=5; var birthMonth=10%; var age=birthDay*birthMonth; print (age);
[01:57:26] <b-ot> x-finite: No output.
[01:57:30] <x-finite> seems like it
[01:57:56] <sammich> well yeah, you're feeding new Date(10, '5a', '20a1aksdhasd')
[01:57:57] <x-finite> i will be using the jquery's isNumeric function .. but can't decide whether i should use it on age or individual values
[02:02:10] <x-finite> seems to work, hope there isn't 'something' that'll bypass this check
[02:02:47] <sammich> where are you going to use this data?
[02:13:09] <anew> usually if i'm using display:none and $().append
[02:13:17] <anew> the css will render bad until everything is completely loaded
[02:13:28] <anew> anyway to have the page load 'normally'
[02:13:58] <sammich> usually, I like to give more context and an example
[02:14:53] <anew> forget the display part
[02:15:12] <anew> anything i have <div id = #this > and i use $.(#this).append()
[02:15:30] <anew> page elements will not load the same way as if i'm not using jq at all
[02:15:44] <anew> during page load elements will be misplaced
[02:15:53] <anew> but when it's finished they will all be where they are supposed to be
[02:17:04] <sammich> can you put it into a fiddle?
[02:19:34] <anew> meh so huge
[02:19:38] <anew> will try to figurer it out
[02:19:39] <anew> thx
[02:22:15] <sammich> you also need to check when jQuery is doing it's manipulation. If you're doing it on $ready, then it'll be firing after the scripts have loaded but CSS hasn't necessarily been applied yet.
[02:22:38] <sammich> to the page
[04:47:10] <sikor_sxe> hello, i have some kind of modal popup-menu implemented, which disappears when pressing esc *or* when selecting an item from the popup box. Thus i bound the keyup event to $(document), and unbind it in the handler via $(this).unbind(event).
[04:47:54] <sikor_sxe> i wonder know how to unbind it, when selecting an item. is there a (supported) way to find bound events for a selector?
[04:49:33] <sikor_sxe> i could set the handler via .data(...) and unbind that, but that seems a bit awkward
[04:54:16] <sikor_sxe> wow, there is .one :)
[04:55:57] <doug65536> why would an href="#" page take me to site.com/#
[04:56:08] <doug65536> oops
[04:56:33] <doug65536> why would an <a href="#">...</a> take me to site.com/# when I am at site.com/123/45
[04:57:07] <doug65536> I thought href="#" means "go nowhere"
[05:17:38] <grafi> hm
[05:17:58] <grafi> is it go nowhere?

[05:46:33] <krambiorix> hi, i have a problem with datepicker.... It only works when right clicking the input field :s
[05:52:53] <grafi> make a jsfiddle
[05:57:52] <msafi> I have this as the innerHTML value of an element "<p class="movement ng-binding" ng-bind-html="movement"><span class="text-danger">-10%</span></p>". I want to select the <span>, but I'm unable to select it using elm.find('p span'). Anyone know why?
[05:57:58] <msafi> I can select it fine with just elm.find('span')
[05:58:46] <krambiorix> grafi, well i hoped this would work on jsfiddle but it doesn't http://jsfiddle.net/BjUrj/
[06:00:42] <grafi> include jquery ui and it does http://jsfiddle.net/BjUrj/1/ krambiorix
[06:02:40] <krambiorix> grafi, my input fields are added by a ajax response, maybe that's the reason?
[06:03:06] <grafi> so call the datepicker() in the success callback maybe?
[06:03:17] <grafi> or do you do that already?
[06:13:44] <krambiorix> grafi, yes :s
[06:14:22] <grafi> hm
[06:15:26] <krambiorix> grafi, it's like i can't even select the input field with my cursor
[06:15:52] <grafi> well without seeing it, it will be very hard to fix :x
[06:16:13] <krambiorix> grafi, i can only select it with right click
[06:16:14] <krambiorix> :s
[06:16:59] <grafi> sounds strange
[06:19:53] <krambiorix> grafi, just tested it without the ajax request and it works
[06:20:37] <krambiorix> grafi, can i bind an event to an element that does not yet exist?
[06:22:33] <grafi> lookup .on and event delegation maybe krambiorix
[06:22:47] <grafi> i wonder though why it doesnt work inside the success callback
[06:22:51] <grafi> seems like it should
[06:25:49] <krambiorix> grafi, this is my code http://pastebin.com/haQYChW0
[06:28:17] <grafi> so your elements already exist on the page?
[06:28:38] <grafi> nvm
[06:28:40] <grafi> hm
[06:38:47] <krambiorix> grafi, ok, i added the input box before the dropzone call is made. It works... But after the call it doesn't work anymore :s
[06:39:07] <grafi> :|
[06:47:02] <krambiorix> grafi, ok the problem is dropzonejs
[06:47:12] <Cool-Dev> can you tell me ways to make a website like this? (atleast) what this styling is called? what to use to make this elements go left, right, upward etc? http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/
[06:49:15] <Cool-Dev> any help?
[06:49:25] <Deas> dam that's fancy :p
[06:50:06] <Cool-Dev> ?
[06:52:09] <Cool-Dev> can anybody help?
[06:54:52] <Guest33529> Hi, is there a way to do a success callback for multiple ajax calls? Like 1 section of code that needs to be ran after all ajax calls are done
[06:57:38] <doug65536> Guest33529: yes, using deferred...
[06:58:41] <doug65536> Guest33529: var ajax1 = $.get('url', foodata, null, 'json'), ajax2 = $.get('url', bardata, null, 'json'); $.when(ajax1, ajax2).done(function(ajax1response, ajax2response) { ... });
[07:02:10] <krambiorix> doug65536, do you have experience with dropzonejs?
[07:02:34] <krambiorix> after upload i can't click my input fields
[07:03:29] <doug65536> krambiorix: did you see if there is an overlay in the way in debugger?
[07:03:51] <doug65536> krambiorix: or a more basic question, did you check debugger console to see if any scripts crash?
[07:05:00] <krambiorix> doug65536, 2nd question, of course d
[07:05:01] <krambiorix> :D
[07:05:15] <krambiorix> doug65536, you were right!!! an overlay!
[07:05:18] <krambiorix> (blockui)
[07:07:38] <Guest33529> ty
[07:09:27] <doug65536> krambiorix: do you get a complete event?
[07:10:02] <krambiorix> doug65536, a success event where i then hide the overlay: $(".blockUI").fadeOut("fast");    $(".blockUI").remove();
[07:10:57] <Guest33529> he doesn't recognize done()  :(
[07:11:09] <Guest33529> doug
[07:11:38] <krambiorix> grafi, fyi  it's solved, the blockui overlay was the culprit
[07:11:46] <krambiorix> grafi, doug65536 thanks a lot for your time/help!
[07:11:59] <grafi> good job
[07:17:01] <doug65536> Cool-Dev: I don't see what you're talking about on that page
[07:17:46] <Cool-Dev> doug65536, actually I was talking about what js they used there.
[07:18:59] <doug65536> Cool-Dev: they are using a slider. there are over 100 slider plugins in jquery's plugin registry http://plugins.jquery.com/tag/slider/ http://plugins.jquery.com/tag/slideshow/
[07:20:19] <Cool-Dev> doug65536, ok thanks.
[07:20:42] <Guest33529> my editor underlines that done() function as unresolved, doug6556 :(
[07:20:44] <doug65536> Cool-Dev: they are also using a tool to mash all the scripts into one block of minified gibberish, so it's difficult to tell for sure what they are using
[07:21:42] <Cool-Dev> doug65536, ok, and can you tell me what this web design trend/style is called? its one page.
[07:21:55] <doug65536> Guest33529: ignore your editor. it doesn't know what it's talking about
[07:22:08] <Guest33529> It does
[07:22:56] <Guest33529> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/ - they make a dfd object here
[07:23:02] <Cool-Dev> doug65536, any reply?
[07:23:03] <Guest33529> is that not needed in your example?
[07:23:36] <Guest33529> doug65536: can I show you the code in PM so you can see if the syntax is right?
[07:23:55] <doug65536> Cool-Dev: not sure, dynamic content, or dynamic content ajax will give you results
[07:24:05] <doug65536> Guest33529: sure
[07:25:29] <Cool-Dev> doug65536, ok

[07:43:05] <Technical_13> Also, a link to a pastebin or a jsfiddle goes a long way to getting help...

[07:46:34] <Guest73953> Here is my Problem http://jsfiddle.net/CpU3R/1/
[07:47:27] <HenryCH> Hi guys, have an issue here with ajax requests failing, can't seem to figure it out. I have two ajax requests for two different .php files being run on a setinterval. First 10 or so requests for each are successful, but then after that all subsequent requests fail. If I remove the requesst for the page with the most data (still small i think, 780B), then the other one's requests will be mostly successful but will still fail in block
[07:47:51] <dwarder> nevermind
[07:48:24] <HenryCH> None of this happens if I run the site on localhost
[07:48:50] <Guest73953> It seems so easy but it will not work http://jsfiddle.net/CpU3R/1/
[07:49:28] <HenryCH> But I used to have practically identical requests for the same data running on the same host before and this did not happen
[07:49:38] <HenryCH> Any ideas what could be causing it?
[07:54:13] <Guest73953> Ill post one message and if anyone knows just reply, thanks (all info is in comments on jsfiddle) http://jsfiddle.net/CpU3R/1/
[07:56:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> Guest73953: im trying give me a sec, you just want them to switch right?
[07:56:47] <Guest73953> yeah thanks
[07:57:00] <Guest73953> it just dosen't seem to work for me
[07:58:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> im trying a different approach
[07:58:49] <Technical_13> Guest73953: http://jsfiddle.net/CpU3R/2/
[07:59:01] <Technical_13> Done Rohan_Bhangui
[07:59:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> Technical_13: im just gonna go ahead and say you used hasClass() in your solution?
[07:59:56] <Technical_13> nope Rohan_Bhangui
[08:00:08] <Technical_13> Rohan_Bhangui: http://jsfiddle.net/CpU3R/2/
[08:00:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> Technical_13: well thats the way I was going, i saw its much more elegant
[08:00:50] <Technical_13> KISS
[08:00:58] <HenryCH> what is the i for?
[08:01:09] <Technical_13> (Keep It Stupid Simple) in case you were wondering.
[08:01:20] <Technical_13> the i is a counter.
[08:01:23] <Technical_13> kind of.

[08:23:12] <FuryFoo> Hi everyone - I'm trying to have a function loop trough several sections but it stops after just two loops or even after one loops . I believe I'm forgetting something here . Please advise
[08:23:13] <FuryFoo> http://pastebin.com/8zzb5TGN
[08:26:44] <Technical_13> FuryFoo: You have some missing semicolons and an extra one in the wrong spot...
[08:27:35] <Technical_13> FuryFoo: http://pastebin.com/swULsKe2
[08:27:39] <Technical_13> Try that
[08:28:03] <FuryFoo> Thanks I'll give it a spin
[08:29:19] <FuryFoo> Stopped after one the first section
[08:29:31] <FuryFoo> After just one section
[08:30:00] <FuryFoo> I think I'll just go with a standard for loop
[08:30:29] <Technical_13> If you could put that in a jsfiddle with some html for context, I could quickly figure it out for you.
[08:30:55] <Technical_13> Just giving me part of the script makes it hard to see why it fails... I can't get an error console unless I can run it. ;)
[08:31:47] <FuryFoo> Give me a sec to clear up a subdomain
[08:32:04] <Technical_13> Sure.
[09:07:34] <Technical_13> Okay, so I've got an $.ajax( call and I'm trying to set up an error: function (){ but I keep getting an error that it expects an identifier and recieved '(' instead.  And I'm reading api.jquery and see a note that says This handler is not called for cross-domain script and cross-domain JSONP requests.
[09:07:51] <Technical_13> So, my question is how do I do error: with cross-domain JSONP requests?
[09:28:05] <Technical_13> !api ajaxSuccess
[09:28:05] <b-ot> Technical_13: .ajaxSuccess(): Attach a function to be executed whenever an Ajax request completes successfully. This is an <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax_Events">Ajax Event</a>. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxSuccess/
[09:32:09] <RonWhoCares> how do I clear all the <select> options using a jQuery script?  Does $('#list_reference').val('');  or something else?
[09:34:59] <Technical_13> RonWhoCares: What do you mean "clear"?
[09:35:14] <RonWhoCares> I want to return to an empty list
[09:35:45] <Technical_13> Like $( 'select option' ).html( '' ); ?
[09:36:27] <RonWhoCares> - jquery populates the list ; when the form is submitted I need to return to an empty list, removing all the <option> values
[09:36:28] <Technical_13> Well... that would clear the text of the items... though they would still be clickable and do stuff...
[09:36:49] <Technical_13> Oh..  You could just remove them... $( 'select option' ).remove();
[09:36:56] <RonWhoCares> ahh
[09:36:58] <RonWhoCares> ok
[09:37:39] <Technical_13> More specific... $( 'select' ).find( 'option' ).remove()
[09:37:56] <Technical_13> would leave the select, but there would be no options.
[09:38:14] <Technical_13> But if you're going to do that, why not remove the select?
[09:38:35] <Technical_13> Anyways, going to get some lunch...
[09:39:50] <RonWhoCares> The select will be populated again when the user re-completes the form
[09:39:53] <RonWhoCares> Bon appetit
[09:42:19] <HenryCH> I'm going through a tutorial that links to this: http://jsfiddle.net/2uEZ5/  can anyone explain why the b function doesn't seem to run?
[09:58:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> hey
[09:58:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyone familiar with the mixitup library
[10:04:44] <HenryCH> Rohan_Bhangui I am now! thanks
[10:04:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[10:05:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay how do you get responsive images to work
[10:05:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> like they should resize on window resize
[10:05:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> my code is very long
[10:05:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> if you could point me in general direct
[10:07:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> HenryCH: any ideas?
[10:07:53] <HenryCH> No, I meant I didn't know about the library until you posted the link, sorry :|
[10:09:20] <HenryCH> They have demos and documentation at the bottom though
[10:10:32] <super89> does anyone know how to make it so the click event does not apply to <option> but does apply only to the <select>
[10:11:10] <jphase> super89: http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[10:11:51] <jphase> oh that might be the other way around though
[10:11:58] <jphase> that will prevent event bubbling
[10:12:02] <super89> http://jsfiddle.net/n8DBx/1/
[10:12:10] <super89> here is my code
[10:12:27] <super89> there are multiple name fields and multiple dropdowns
[10:12:38] <codechewing> HenryCH: the b function doesn't seem to run because there's an error with the POST request (403 Forbidden) on /ajax_html_echo/
[10:12:39] <super89> when you type something in name field, all of the dropdowns need to update
[10:13:06] <HenryCH> Oh, how did you find that?
[10:13:46] <codechewing> HenryCH: Just open up the console in dev tools and you'll see the error for yourself
[10:14:54] <HenryCH> Isn't that the same address as used in function a? how come that runs
[10:15:46] <HenryCH> oh the output block is outside the ajax call
[10:16:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> ugh okay
[10:16:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> HenryCH: thx anyways
[10:16:34] <HenryCH> Rohan_Bhangui I think you want the scale effect right?
[10:16:36] <codechewing> Exactly. --n; never happens in the Ajax POST callback for function a() either
[10:16:49] <HenryCH> You can see how to use it in the documentation
[10:16:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> HenryCH: scalling is the animation
[10:18:47] <HenryCH> I see, this is an article saying it's preferable to use settimeout over setinterval. I've just adapted my setinterval to settimeout but the function seems to take much longer to execute
[10:20:07] <HenryCH> I was using the same function with setinterval at 1000, now I'm using settimeout at 500 and it executes once every two seconds, I guess the setinterval calls were taking just as long but were queuing up?
[10:22:33] <codechewing> Both setTimeout and setInterval have to queue up, so that could explain why setTimeout wasn't being called 4 times in the 2 seconds...
[10:41:21] <patchie> The function is working well, so line 10 is working when i am loading the page, but when i change the window size, line 12, 13 and 14 doesnt do anything? http://pastebin.com/33dJgTu5
[10:41:25] <patchie> any idea?
[10:41:53] <patchie> $( window ).resize(function() {             // When the window is resized
[10:44:05] <patchie> might be because i am using max-height?
[10:47:48] <codechewing> patchie: To start with, you'd be better off applying the style as an inline style on the .contentPanel DOM element, rather than all this injecting styles into the head nonsense
[10:49:10] <jphase> sup Rohan? How goes it?
[10:51:01] <patchie> codechewing: this is for a greasemonkey script..so this is the only way i have managed it to work
[10:51:08] <patchie> but thats not my problem
[10:51:23] <patchie> i wanna apply the height when the user is resizing the window
[10:54:30] <codechewing> patchie: what determines the heightvariable value?
[10:55:22] <patchie> $(window).height() - 200;
[10:55:39] <Kambfhase> patchie: try using unsafeWindow instead
[10:55:58] <patchie> ohh..will try
[10:56:34] <Kambfhase> And GM has an GM_addStyle function for all you CSS injection needs. http://wiki.greasespot.net/GM_addStyle
[10:58:42] <boytoy> Hi, where would one host external JS/CSS files for jsbin.com? Raw gist URLs don't seem to work (and I don't think rawgithub.com supports gists).
[10:59:09] <jphase> boytoy: a server somewhere if you have one, otherwise dropbox or something
[10:59:28] <boytoy> thanks jphase
[10:59:33] <jphase> np
[11:00:40] <patchie> codechewing: i updated the code...line 1 and 4 is changed: http://pastebin.com/33dJgTu5
[11:02:39] <boytoy> jphase: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GtjaW4Ma3c looks good (jsbin author)
[11:03:10] <codechewing> patchie: Okay. So why are you doing max-height and height if they're always going to be the same value? Wouldn't just height be suffice?
[11:03:49] <patchie> this is a greasemonkey script..so the max-height is allready set...so i must change that one aswell
[11:04:19] <patchie> when i load the page...its good enough to just edit the max-height
[11:04:21] <jphase> ah with gist too, neat
[11:04:38] <patchie> but when i change the size of the window, i guess i must change the height aswell?
[11:08:51] <codechewing> patchie: I'm not familiar with GM, but your code does suggest it will work..
[11:09:58] <patchie> hmm..ok..thanks for having a look nevertheless :)
[11:11:37] <codechewing> patchie: I suggest you have a look at the link Kambfhase sent (http://wiki.greasespot.net/GM_addStyle), and perform the styling through their proprietary method (GM_addStyle)
[11:11:57] <codechewing> patchie: np
[11:12:40] <grafi> codechewing patchie Kambfhase anyone knoew how well the GM_ stuff is supported across browsers? using it might break it for chrome and opera and so on
[11:14:30] <Kambfhase> grafi: Most of those methods ork fine for Chrome.
[11:14:46] <grafi> thats cool
[11:15:18] <jphase> http://wiki.greasespot.net/Cross-browser_userscripting
[11:15:34] <jphase> has some browser support documentation (sort of)
[11:16:04] <Kambfhase> patchie: use unsafeWindow also in line 14
[11:16:26] <scar> any good libraries out there for social media integration/management/auth, etc?
[11:16:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: what up :)
[11:17:09] <jphase> scar: http://www.jquery4u.com/plugins/top-5-jquery-social-feed-plugins-2013/
[11:17:22] <patchie> Kambfhase: will try :)
[11:18:52] <scar> i'm looking more for something that let's me easily manage facebook and twitter, for example, and their logins. i'm integrating with wordpress-- but that's irrelevant. i want to be able to create an account when they login/auth via fb/twitter, and then if they decide to login to a diferent social account while logged in, do something differerent, etc. i can manage the functions, but i'm getting some buggy stuff when messing with the fb js sdk
[11:19:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: you anything about the jquery plugin used for image galleries called mixitup
[11:19:12] <scar> i can get things to post just fine, etc, but it's fine tuning the registration/login process
[11:19:25] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui:  hmm, no don't think I've used that one before
[11:19:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: cause im updating one of the themes I showed you for responsive design
[11:20:25] <jphase> scar: I would suggest making your own API for that or coming up with a PHP solution and use WordPress' native hooks for register and login actions
[11:21:16] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: definitely looks pretty cool
[11:21:46] <scar> i know the wp part. i almost have it, but found some issues with fb sdk. about to jump on twitter and see if that goes fine. i got accounts to create fine, get logged in, etc, but found a weird bug
[11:22:09] <scar> then i was wondering if there was any .js library that allowed for social auth, even listening, etc
[11:22:18] <scar> maybe i should ask ##javascript lol
[11:23:01] <patchie> Kambfhase: it didnt work =/
[11:23:10] <Kambfhase> hmm
[11:23:50] <jphase> scar: oh gotcha. I'm not familiar with many of those solutions, I always just end up doing a custom one for each project, which isn't very smart on my part now that I say it out loud.
[11:24:07] <Kambfhase> Well, you could check via GM_log("foo") if the resize handler fires at all.
[11:24:40] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: I normally use jQuery masonry for that stuff, but this one looks pretty neat too
[11:25:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: i was originally using a plugin called isotope...but the license for commercial use is paid. That's why im using this one
[11:27:52] <jphase> hah, finally got around to greasemonkeying facebook's sponsored ads.
[11:29:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[11:29:32] <scar> jphase, well no that's what im tring to do. just almot gving up and checking out some library options. seems the cool libraries out there i dont need, and the ones i do dont exist ;)
[11:30:13] <scar> if i get twitter integrated fine it'll boost my morale ;) fb is working great i just found one scenario that _always_ breaks, and it's about facebook doing weird things.. firing events at wrong time, or not firing an event at right time
[11:30:16] <jphase> scar: sounds like a good excuse to write a plugin to me ;)
[11:30:16] <scar> but i refresh, and it fixes
[11:30:22] <scar> ;)
[11:30:44] <scar> i'll jump on twitter first. i'm sure it's a fb thing ;)
[11:30:52] <jphase> yeah, facebook is actually quite frustrating in general for developers
[11:31:03] <tw2113> not worth it imho
[11:31:11] <scar> which part?
[11:31:26] <Kambfhase> the face part
[11:31:29] <jphase> lol
[11:31:38] <jphase> I think the book is a little tricky too
[11:32:06] <scar> fb js sdk seems pretty straightforward, and works pretty darn good. but maybe i just found a bug and need to report it lol.
[11:32:14] <scar> little bastards ruining my sunday ;)
[11:32:28] <Kambfhase> That akward moment when you realise a `webpage` is actually a scroll.
[11:35:09] <scar> tw2113, what's not worth it?
[11:35:17] <tw2113> facebook
[11:35:22] <scar> yea :\
[11:35:31] <scar> what about twitter?
[11:36:19] <tw2113> though their 1.1 api switch still has me irritated a bit, they're better with a lot of things
[11:37:19] <scar> everytime i'm about to give up, i look around for any plugin or forum post and realize i'm better off just figuring it out haha.
[11:37:47] <scar> gives great motivation actually. in fact, i'm about to _have_ to complete this part. before, i've just read up on my spare time to kind of prepare.
[11:43:03] <jphase> if anyone wants a greasemonkey script that removes facebook ads (from sidebar and from user stream on an interval) then here ya go:  http://pastebin.ws/chcw02
[11:45:21] <jphase> oh, my match comment should have https:// in there, whoops
[11:49:07] <Kambfhase> Suggested Page? That would be "Empfohlene Seiten" to me :)
[11:51:30] <jphase> oh, yes, it's assuming english :x
[11:52:07] <jphase> perhaps I can do some fancy language detection lul
[11:52:33] <Kambfhase> o.O
[11:53:04] <jphase> even then, Empfohlene Seiten is Recommended Sites so I couldn't really translate it from Suggested Page anyhow
[11:53:10] * jphase gets sad
[11:54:54] <jphase> god, salesforce and youtube need to get with the program and stop polluting my console with access origin errors
[11:55:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[11:55:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: can i get some help with that algorithm last time we .....well never finished
[11:55:37] <jphase> oh yeah, sure
[11:55:47] <jphase> let me try to figure out this salesforce thing first
[11:55:54] <jphase> If I don't have this done by tomorrow I'll be upset
[11:56:29] <Kambfhase> jphase: http://pastebin.ws/3ut811
[11:57:03] <jphase> hah, nice
[11:59:22] <Kambfhase> (not tested, though)
[11:59:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: ping me when your done
[11:59:43] <jphase> sure thing
[12:11:47] <jphase> hmm, anyone know of a clever way to prevent browser redirects in chrome?
[12:12:47] <jphase> have this thing I'm trying to debug and it does a ghetto window.location.href on successful form submit and idk how to prevent it so I can see the post data
[12:15:06] <jphase> ahh, event listener breakpoints ftw!
[12:17:41] <jned> prevent.default()
[12:18:01] <tw2113> preventDefault() actually
[12:18:30] <jphase> and it's also not on a script that I wrote, so I'd have to inject that into the DOM to try to get it to work
[12:18:47] <jphase> event listener breakpoints got me what I needed
[12:19:01] <jphase> which are super rad and I never use them
[12:21:26] <jned> oh sorry
[12:21:39] <jphase> all good
[12:32:36] <jtreminio> hi all. I want to get data attributes for an element, using data(). In 1.4.4 I would get the *actual* attribute name: http://jsfiddle.net/yijiang/WVfSg/
[12:33:04] <jtreminio> However, in 2.0.2, I am getting a camelCased name, "originalDataName"
[12:33:16] <jtreminio> how do I force it to return the original name?
[12:34:25] <jphase> jtreminio: I'm getting the same result in 2.0.2
[12:35:11] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/WVfSg/225/
[12:35:46] <jtreminio> jphase: http://jsfiddle.net/As65F/
[12:36:12] <jphase> oic
[12:36:18] <jtreminio> "original-data-name" vs "originalDataName"
[12:36:46] <jphase> you could always just regex it if you really needed it
[12:36:47] <Velveeta> you can't force it to return the hyphenated name, but you can transform the name it returns if you have to
[12:36:54] <Velveeta> just uncamelcase it
[12:37:00] <jtreminio> what :\
[12:37:27] <jtreminio> seems like that would have been the perfect opportunity for a parameter!
[12:38:24] <Velveeta> data properties are stored on dom nodes in a camelcased format anyway
[12:38:33] <Velveeta> all they did was make their own function match behavior
[12:38:45] <jphase> jtreminio: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/As65F/1/
[12:39:02] <jphase> yeah it's actually good cause it's all object notated ftw
[12:39:03] <Velveeta> ^^ that
[12:39:59] <jtreminio> thanks guys. seems kind of dirty needing to regex but it works
[12:40:19] <Velveeta> seems kind of dirty having the function return nonstandard formats too :)
[12:41:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol agreed6
[12:41:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> *^
[12:44:51] <jphase> jtreminio: Unless you're trying to use the data attribute in a selector, you don't need the hyphened version btw
[12:44:58] <jtreminio> jphase: I am
[12:45:00] <jphase> k
[12:45:03] <jphase> just makin' sure
[12:52:01] <HenryCH> Can anyone suggest a possible cause for why something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/G6TFN/    would work for the first 20+ requests and then give an error (no error text in the alert window) and stop sending requests from there. It works fine when testing on localhost
[12:54:16] <jphase> HenryCH: is there throttling on the server side by chance?
[12:54:31] <HenryCH> throttling?
[12:54:47] <jphase> x amount of requests can come through in y time interval
[12:54:59] <jphase> some servers do it with curl requests and such
[12:55:18] <HenryCH> oh, let me try change the interval then
[12:55:39] <HenryCH> What's strange is that virtually the same code was working yesterday
[12:55:58] <HenryCH> but then if it were a problem with the code how come the first 20+ go through fine
[12:56:12] <jphase> that'd be something like throttling
[12:56:16] <jphase> not the code
[12:56:40] <HenryCH> could it have been the webhost that put something in place from yesterday?
[12:57:12] <jphase> quite possible, with maybe an updated server package or perhaps they bumped up their security, but usually that's something that's a little excessive for just POST requests
[12:57:36] <jphase> the best way to confirm it's the server environment would be to download the update.php script and run it locally on a web server
[12:57:45] <jphase> if you get past 20 then that host is throttling most likely
[12:58:26] <HenryCH> yea if I host it on my pc it works fine
[12:59:24] <jphase> well see if increasing the interval to like 10000 might get you past 20
[12:59:36] <HenryCH> could it be that the webhost monitors traffic for those kinds of repeated same page requests and then applies a throttle
[12:59:41] <jphase> if that's the case then you might need to find "the sweet spot" with their throttling interval
[12:59:47] <jphase> yes
[13:00:17] <HenryCH> hm.. and that's not something that I can change myself right? I'd have to email them and ask them to remove it right
[13:00:21] <jphase> proactive server admins will sometimes write scripts to limit repeated TCP requests to prevent DDOS attempts and such
[13:00:39] <jphase> I doubt it, what's the host?
[13:00:41] <jphase> do you have root?
[13:01:10] <HenryCH> I just bought a month of hosting on godaddy to test stuff
[13:01:32] <HenryCH> it's a shared server I guess
[13:01:34] <jphase> that's quite an annoying thing to do
[13:01:43] <jphase> (on godaddy's part)
[13:01:49] <jphase> if that's indeed what's happening
[13:01:58] <jphase> did increasing the interval help?
[13:02:46] <HenryCH> running it now
[13:04:00] <HenryCH> but on the other hand, I have two such functions getting two separate .php and the other function continues running, albeit with intermittent fails
[13:04:35] <jphase> hmmm with the same or similar interval?
[13:04:56] <HenryCH> yea
[13:05:22] <jphase> and the post/get values are the same on every request?
[13:06:31] <HenryCH> post values?
[13:06:40] <jphase> like the values in your ajax request
[13:06:51] <jphase> they're the same with every request (in your other script)?
[13:07:10] <HenryCH> yea just the url changes in the same way as with this script
[13:07:14] <HenryCH> to get around caching
[13:07:17] <jphase> then the server isn't throttling
[13:07:44] <jphase> hmm, I'm not sure exactly
[13:08:13] <HenryCH> It's on 10 now, still hasn't crashed
[13:11:35] <HenryCH> The script that never crashes is just getting a number though, the one that crashes has 2.2kb of content, or at least that's what developer tools says
[13:12:03] <HenryCH> size 940B content 2.2KB, not sure what to make of that :P
[13:12:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> HenryCH: what is the application of what you are doing?
[13:12:50] <HenryCH> still hasn't crashed, could it be that they are throttling on data rather than requests?
[13:13:25] <jphase> all of that is possible but I don't see why they would do that
[13:13:59] <jphase> unless it's an annoying new "upgrade" to their pricing model and now you have to buy some sort of package or something
[13:14:05] <HenryCH> limit bandwidth use on shared server accounts?
[13:14:17] <jphase> quite possible
[13:14:23] <Minizarbi> Hi
[13:14:25] <jphase> that's usually in a cloud model though
[13:14:30] <jphase> hi Minizarbi
[13:15:03] <Minizarbi> I need some help, if someone has time for me ?
[13:15:32] <HenryCH> Doesn't look like it's going to crash now, I'll bump the interval to somewhere inbetween the two
[13:15:34] <jphase> Minizarbi: no need to ask to ask, just ask ;)
[13:16:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> Minizarbi: someone is probably able to help if you have a question
[13:16:05] <jphase> HenryCH: yeah it sounds definitely like throttling now... now you just have to reverse-engineer their "sweet spot" interval
[13:16:31] <HenryCH> but that would mean they applied it yesterday
[13:16:48] * jphase isn't shocked by anything with "go" and "daddy" in the same sentence
[13:17:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[13:17:26] <Minizarbi> Ok, so, I'm trying to code an userscript with greasemonkey, it seems the language used by userscript is Javascript, and Jquery also, I want to use a Jquery library (DHTML Tooltips) and I don't know how to do without modify the html page ?
[13:17:29] <jphase> my involvement with them ends at an occasional domain name registration
[13:18:05] <jphase> Minizarbi: you can just inject it into the page
[13:18:12] <jphase> sec
[13:18:51] <Minizarbi> Hmm, I'm not really good, how can I do that ?
[13:19:08] <jphase> / @require     http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.js
[13:19:18] <jphase> whoops that's missing a /
[13:19:41] <jphase> but I think you can just put it in your @require in the comment block
[13:20:55] <jphase> if that doesn't work you can create a script element and insert it into the page with something like $('<script>').prop('src', 'http://some.website.com/script.js').appendTo($('head'));
[13:23:02] <Minizarbi> Ok, I'll try that, thank you :P
[13:23:05] <jphase> but I really don't know wtf I'm talking about so don't listen to me hehe
[13:23:37] <Minizarbi> I don't really know what I'm doing too.
[13:24:18] <jphase> Minizarbi: this is an example of a quick greasemonkey script I wrote if you need a wrapper: http://pastebin.ws/chcw02
[13:26:53] <Minizarbi> Okok
[13:29:33] <Mrgoose2> how do you do cross domain ajax requests?
[13:29:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> Mrgoose2: cross domain like from 1 webiste to another?
[13:30:26] <Mrgoose2> Rohan_Bhangui: yes
[13:30:49] <jphase> Mrgoose2: You do it with CORS and you need to set your Access-Control-Allow-Origin on the server
[13:30:51] <HenryCH> yea definitely seems like throttling..
[13:31:04] <HenryCH> if I set the interval really low it crashes almost immediately
[13:31:06] <jphase> HenryCH: silly godaddy... :[
[13:31:40] <HenryCH> is there a more effective way of getting data from mysql only when the database changes?
[13:31:45] <Mrgoose2> jphase: sounds like a lot of work
[13:31:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> Mrgoose2: http://stackoverflow.com/a/2559012
[13:31:55] <jphase> Mrgoose2: really not that big of a deal actually
[13:32:08] <jphase> I'm doing it right now for a salesforce thing I'm doing
[13:32:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> HenryCH: would the data base change only when a mquery is submitted?
[13:32:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> *mysql query
[13:32:24] <Mrgoose2> so how do people do like ajax calls to twitter and apis like that
[13:32:29] <Mrgoose2> to retrieve tweets
[13:32:55] <HenryCH> yes
[13:32:59] <jphase> Mrgoose2: that's not necessarily the same thing there
[13:33:19] <jphase> Mrgoose2: they usually offer an API that allows you to authenticate through them on the server side
[13:33:21] <Mrgoose2> why not?  it's a remote domain
[13:33:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> HenryCH: so create a global var that turns on only when there is a database change
[13:33:49] <Mrgoose2> jphase: sorry.  that's what im trying to do , access a remote api
[13:34:48] <jphase> Mrgoose2: depends on their API really. Some folks provide a JSON object when you hit a specific URL, others require you to use CURL and send requests to issue a token for subsequent requests of data
[13:35:32] <jphase> Mrgoose2: which one are you trying to integrate with?
[13:39:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: what are you working on right now? you mentioned some sort of script with salesforce and youtube?
[13:41:22] <Mrgoose2> jphase: well its an api i created.  but i get this error XMLHttpRequest cannot load. Cross origin requests are only supported for HTTP. when i try to do a local ajax request
[13:42:23] <jphase> well a client of mine manages their jobs (applications, listings, database, etc.) through salesforce with this 3rd party add on called "Job Science". They have to host all their job board content on SF and their WordPress site's styles and markup were copied to SF. The problem is, they can't change their nav items, widgets in their sidebar, etc. without the changes not coming through to SF.
[13:42:52] <jphase> I'm writing a dynamic wrapper that loads all my content from their current site and moves all the SF content around so their site is basically copied over to the SF wrapper dynamically
[13:43:11] <jphase> Mrgoose2: add this to your .htaccess file:  Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
[13:43:31] <Mrgoose2> ok
[13:43:55] <Mrgoose2> is that what twitter does, then make you authenticate your request
[13:44:33] <jphase> well... most places that do it strictly for secure data need to create an authentication layer
[13:45:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: interesting
[13:45:58] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: more annoying than anything really
[13:46:26] <anew> can anything be done about using so many plugins and requests?
[13:46:30] <anew> combine them all into one file or something ?
[13:46:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: i guess in a way......frankly I mthe type of person who is like: "f*** this shit im not dealing with the existing crap. im gonna write my stuff from scratch"
[13:47:11] <jphase> hehe yeah
[13:47:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> anew: yes
[13:47:27] <jphase> anew: Is that your entire question?
[13:47:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> anew: i think ive seen it done before
[13:47:40] * jphase feels like he missed the context
[13:47:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> anew: just make sure you add comments to section off your code
[13:48:06] <anew> jphase problem?
[13:48:16] * Rohan_Bhangui regrets he went in without context
[13:48:52] <jphase> anew: do I have a problem? No, I'm doing just fine, how are you?
[13:48:56] <Minizarbi> How do I add something just after <body> ?
[13:49:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> Minizarbi: prepend
[13:49:17] <jphase> Minizarbi: $('<div>').insertAfter('body');
[13:49:18] <anew> jphase that was the whole question then
[13:49:22] <jphase> ohhh
[13:49:23] <jphase> sorry
[13:49:28] <jphase> <body> not </body>
[13:49:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> no jhpase you right
[13:49:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> *jphase
[13:49:39] <jphase> oh okay
[13:49:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> you right re: Minizarbi  question
[13:51:13] <jphase> Mrgoose2: You should read this, it will help get a better understanding for the right way to do what you're doing: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[13:53:44] <jphase> Mrgoose2: Though, if the data you are returning to your ajax post isn't something that needs to be secured then you can use the .htaccess line I gave you before.
[13:54:41] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: I had my buddy ask the design team and Wikimedia if they need an intern btw. He'll let me know if they have room in their SF office for ya.
[13:55:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: thank you very much. I really appreciate you helping me out.
[13:55:25] <jphase> np
[13:55:42] <jphase> and=at
[13:57:24] <Minizarbi> :/
[13:58:24] <Minizarbi> I want to use this : http://www.walterzorn.de/en/tooltip/tooltip_e.htm on a userscript for a page already using jquery…
[13:59:11] <anew> anyone?
[13:59:15] <anew> combining all plugins?
[13:59:20] <anew> do or dont
[13:59:30] <jphase> anew: you can do it if you do it in the right order sure
[13:59:47] <anew> i'm making so many requests to my plugins
[13:59:48] <jphase> I do it on some sites on the server-side to minify and such
[13:59:49] <anew> is there another way
[13:59:56] <anew> how server side ?
[14:00:04] <jphase> with PHP for example
[14:00:15] <jphase> Minizarbi: you should be able to do that, are you having problems?
[14:00:25] <anew> i dont understand
[14:00:31] <anew> u do what server side? combine everything ?
[14:00:38] <jphase> yeah
[14:00:46] <jphase> and set the header to content type text/javascript
[14:00:48] <jphase> then spit it out
[14:00:58] <jphase> then your script tag has a .php file in it instead for example
[14:01:41] <anew> what? i cant follow at all, do u have an exmaple?
[14:02:10] <jphase> sure
[14:02:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> anew: why would you want to combine in the first place....most plugins have a minified version anyways
[14:02:36] <jphase> this is how I do it on one of my client sites:
[14:02:39] <jphase> anew: http://pastebin.ws/bbojql
[14:02:42] <anew> yeah well u still have like 10 requests to make minimized or not
[14:03:37] <jphase> my example?
[14:03:40] <anew> oh wow
[14:03:43] <anew> that's awesome
[14:03:51] <anew> really really awesome
[14:03:53] <jphase> why thank you...
[14:04:01] <anew> then it's only one request
[14:04:04] <jphase> yeah
[14:04:06] <anew> so if u are using googld cdn jquery
[14:04:12] <anew> where is that? on a seperate line ?
[14:04:12] <jphase> and file_get_contents to scrape code from js files
[14:04:17] <jphase> nah that's fine
[14:04:21] <jphase> add it to the array
[14:04:23] <anew> damn
[14:04:25] <jphase> file_get_contents works remotely
[14:04:27] <anew> this is
[14:04:30] <anew> amazing
[14:04:32] <anew> mind blown
[14:04:39] <jphase> :)
[14:04:55] <anew> i have everything right now in require.js
[14:05:04] <anew> but it still has to use each plugin seperately
[14:05:09] <anew> this is better i think
[14:05:12] <anew> do u know require.js ?
[14:05:29] <jphase> I have heard of it b4 but never used no
[14:05:33] <anew> ok
[14:06:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: thats a real clever script
[14:06:55] <Dysharmonic> My preloaded images seem to be "unloading" after a certain amount of time; can anyone explain to me why?
[14:07:01] <jphase> well thanks, I didn't expect to get so much praise
[14:07:02] <jphase> hehe
[14:07:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> Dysharmonic: jsfiddle?
[14:07:34] <Minizarbi> jphase, I have something like that : $(".prof").prop('onmouseover', "Tip('Some text')").prop('onmouseout', "UnTip()");, I don't know if I can write it like that, it seems it doesn't work, but don't know if it is an imortation problem, or a jquery syntax problem, or other problem :s
[14:08:06] <jphase> Minizarbi: do you have a specific reason you're using that particular tooltip library?
[14:08:34] <Minizarbi> No, the first I found xD, I can do just with title maybe, just trying.
[14:09:03] <jphase> Minizarbi: I'd just use a jQuery plugin for that then, something like jQuery UI or qTip
[14:09:50] <Minizarbi> Oh, then I will search about that.
[14:11:08] <anew> jphase line 9 ....
[14:11:14] <anew> i dont get what ur doing with that
[14:11:43] <dwarder> i have a number 1030 how do i make it 10:30 ?
[14:11:46] <jphase> anew: that sets the headers to tell the browser the content type is text/javascript
[14:11:56] <dwarder> am i need regex?
[14:12:22] <anew> yeah but where do u put it
[14:12:31] <jphase> dwarder: perhaps, but that will most likely break if you have only 1 digit in the hour
[14:13:07] <jphase> anew: anywhere in the PHP script, whenever the content is outputted to the screen it will be in text/javascript
[14:13:25] <jphase> anew: typically I'd put that right before my die() at the bottom, just happens to be up there for some reason
[14:14:11] <dwarder> jphase: i won't have
[14:14:13] <jphase> anew: it allows you to have things like:    <script src="myjavascripts.php"></script>  without browsers barking at you for the mime type being off from .php in a script tag
[14:14:29] <dwarder> jphase: 4 digits always
[14:14:43] <jphase> dwarder: then you should just use .substring
[14:23:05] <dwarder> jphase: thank yo
[14:23:11] <jphase> np
[14:23:13] <dwarder> you*
[14:23:14] <dwarder> :)
[14:24:47] <Kamil__> anyone could point me to resource how could i create a left handed navigation "on thr fly" - ie. create new sections or subsections within browser window? (just like File Explorer in Windows on the left?)
[14:25:43] <jphase> Kamil__: http://jquery.bassistance.de/treeview/demo/
[14:26:18] <Kamil__> jphase: thank you so much!
[14:26:25] <jphase> np
[14:27:37] <jphase> hah! this silly 3rd party company was putting input tags outside of the form and my clone and append methods were busting their weird js
[14:27:52] <jphase> $('input:not(form input)').appendTo('form'); FTW!
[14:45:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[14:53:38] <Minizarbi> Thanks for your help, maybe someday I gonna learn javascript and jquery again, my knowledge is not stable :/
[14:54:12] <Minizarbi> I go to bed now, maaybe see you next time !
[14:56:09] <dwarder> how do i count string chars?
[14:56:16] <jphase> .length
[14:56:27] <dwarder> ty
[14:56:29] <jphase> np
[15:03:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: lol the question they ask here....now a days I just "let me google that for you"
[15:03:59] <jphase> yeah, the occassional lmgtfy.com link is necessary but it always sounds so rude so I only use that for the obvious ones hehe
[15:04:35] <jphase> I don't mind if it's something that someone perhaps just doesn't know the term or function name to put into Google
[15:04:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: its funny when you do do it cause people be like 'oh he giving me the solution' and then you troll them
[15:05:01] <jphase> yeah, that's why I use the short version of their URL haha
[15:05:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[15:05:08] <jphase> they don't see it's trolling until after
[15:05:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[15:05:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> thats like on digg.com
[15:05:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> you put in the konami code and you get rick rolled
[15:05:34] <jphase> yeah haha
[15:05:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> up up dow down left right left right b a
[15:06:01] <jphase> (select start for multiplayer)
[15:06:05] <jphase> :D
[15:06:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[15:12:53] <anew> hey
[15:12:54] <anew> jphase
[15:12:58] <jphase> sup?
[15:13:03] <anew> sorry to burst ur bubble, as awesome as i thought ur script was
[15:13:10] <anew> require.js blows it away ... finally got it working
[15:13:20] <anew> if u have free time for a hobby or whatever u should check it out
[15:13:27] <jphase> lol, okay
[15:13:46] <anew> i mean i never thought of doing what u tdid
[15:13:56] <anew> but require has this optimization
[15:14:04] <anew> that combines everything, minifies it, and uglifies it
[15:14:05] <anew> pretty cool
[15:14:11] <anew> even plugins
[15:14:50] <jphase> yeah, my minify wasn't the best, it was just a quick trimmer more than a minifier
[15:15:32] <jphase> I thought the goal of your project was to only make 1 HTTP request for the scripts?
[15:16:05] <anew> yes it is...
[15:16:10] <anew> require does only one request
[15:16:21] <anew> it combines all ur external js/jq files into one, minifies and uglifies
[15:16:29] <anew> and u can even use cdn's with it
[15:16:33] <jphase> neat
[15:16:49] <anew> yeah pretty cool
[15:16:55] <jphase> my friend uses it for node, I haven't used it before though
[15:17:15] <anew> well about 20 minutes ago i was about to jump out my window
[15:17:20] <anew> but i got it working
[15:18:35] <Atlantic777> I need a little help with debugging jquery mobile. When I hardcode a button it's styled ok, but when I append some elements with a jQuery after page loading, that elements aren't "jquery mobile". Any hints?
[15:19:02] <jphase> Atlantic777: are you append <li> elements by chance?
[15:19:38] <Atlantic777> jphase: no, just a plain <div> and I append some buttons with appendTo()
[15:20:14] <Atlantic777> It seems like order of loading is problem, or something similar.
[15:20:29] <jphase> Atlantic777: you can trigger the create event I think
[15:21:51] <jphase> $('#yourdiv').append(html).trigger('create');
[15:22:43] <Atlantic777> jphase: of #yourdiv stands for button_container ID, it didn't work
[15:23:01] <jphase> Atlantic777: can you jsfiddle it for me?
[15:23:12] <Atlantic777> jphase: sure
[15:23:24] <jphase> Atlantic777: This one works for me http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/eLENj/633/
[15:26:22] <jphase> but it's uber old
[15:28:21] <jphase> apparently you can do it by page too
[15:28:32] <jphase> $('#pageID').trigger('pagecreate');
[15:30:28] <Atlantic777> jphase: http://jsfiddle.net/4BvUr/
[15:31:29] <Atlantic777> I generate buttons like this because I have array of strings, and for every element I generate a button with different name and URL.
[15:33:16] <Atlantic777> Ok, it seems I got it.
[15:33:36] <Atlantic777> jphase: if I call button_list.trigger('create'); as a separate command, it works.
[15:33:47] <jphase> ahh, just a problem with chaining
[15:33:48] <jphase> ic
[15:33:50] <Atlantic777> If I just add it to the end of appendTo(), it's not.
[15:33:57] <Atlantic777> thanks :)
[15:34:32] <jphase> np
[15:43:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: any chance I can pick your brain now?
[15:43:13] <jphase> I'm close to being done
[15:43:25] <jphase> got all the forms submitting now, 2 secs
[15:45:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[15:59:32] <toothrot> is there a recommended way to normalize URLs? I need to compare a couple urls, the browser is tweaking ones already in the html, so they don't match ones I'm pulling in through an AJAX request.. (eg file://domain vs file:///\\domain)
[16:00:17] <jphase> toothrot: you should try to avoid ajax with local files
[16:00:42] <toothrot> eh?
[16:00:48] <toothrot> i'm not making an ajax request on a local file
[16:01:01] <jphase> oh, saw the file:// protocol
[16:01:09] <toothrot> i'm building a link based on data from an ajax call
[16:01:15] <toothrot> that wasn't clear, my fault
[16:01:46] <jphase> so what's not matching? What are you trying to accomplish exactly?
[16:02:27] <toothrot> one url has `file:///\\hostname/`, and the other pulled from element.href has `file://hostname/`
[16:02:46] <toothrot> even though the href in the actual html matches
[16:03:38] <jphase> toothrot: can you create a jsfiddle with a sample response from your ajax request in a variable, and the line where you're trying to match it?
[16:04:03] <toothrot> i just want to normalize urls, the source is irrelevant.
[16:04:18] <jphase> toothrot: regex
[16:04:49] <toothrot> of course i can solve this one case, i was hoping for a more general solution
[16:05:05] <jphase> regex would be a general solution
[16:05:38] <toothrot> using regex to what? manually munge the one case I'm describing?
[16:05:42] <jphase> if you don't want to take the time to get specific then I can't give you a specific regex example, but you can use regex to normalize URLs or any string for that matter
[16:06:11] <jphase> you clearly aren't familiar with regex and your attitude stinks, I wish you the best of luck
[16:06:40] <toothrot> sorry that's the impression you get. i am familiar with how a regex can solve this specific example.
[16:07:15] <toothrot> i know i can do string manipulation to solve this one case. i don't want to worry about other corner cases, things i've not discovered yet..
[16:08:06] <toothrot> (that's why i was asking about general url normalization.)
[16:08:10] <toothrot> thanks for your time anyways.
[16:08:11] <jphase> since regex can match, and replace any part of a URL based on knowing how a URL is composed (optional protocol, optional domain, optional TLD, etc.) then you could take the URL string (of various types... with and without the aforementioned optionals) and normalize it
[16:08:57] <toothrot> sure, i get you, i didn't want to roll my own (probably buggy) version if something already exists..
[16:09:26] <jphase> http://lmgtfy.com?jquery+normalize+url
[16:09:59] <Atlantic777> jphase: any ideas why this trigger('create') thing isn't working with listsviews?
[16:10:07] <toothrot> yes, i did that, saw URI.js, etc.
[16:10:11] <jphase> Atlantic777: you have a .listview method for that
[16:10:26] <jphase> .listview('refresh');
[16:11:02] <Atlantic777> jphase: oh, that's it.
[16:11:28] <Atlantic777> Why I can't find this things in docs? :/
[16:12:05] <VCoolio> hi, I'm trying to use h5validate plugin; it seems I need to do something like $('#Form').h5Validate(); after that, how do I check if it succeeded? It seems it has an event 'validated', but I don't know how I use that
[16:14:53] <jphase> VCoolio: that depends on whether the plugin offers a method for checking it's valid. A lot of validation will just add error classes to elements
[16:15:30] <jphase> VCoolio: and prevent the form from submitting of course. If they only add error classes to the elements you could check to see if those classes exist on the page I suppose.
[16:16:41] <jphase> looks like they have some stuff you can use in their Event API section
[16:18:52] <VCoolio> that's the thing I don't understand; I'm noobish btw, it's just that I don't get the event part; It's not like if('#Form.validated){ continue }; so how to use event?
[16:19:13] <jphase> VCoolio: oh, it looks like they say you can check validity on the form or the specific element
[16:19:35] <jphase> $('form').formValidated(); for the form
[16:19:49] <jphase> which is an object
[16:20:06] <jphase> so you'd do something like.... var isvalid = $('form').formValidated();
[16:20:13] <VCoolio> ah, let's try that
[16:20:15] <jphase> if(isvalid.valid){ // stuff }
[16:23:14] <VCoolio> nope, error "formValidated() is not a function"
[16:23:22] <jphase> hmm
[16:24:02] <jphase> perhaps their events are real events? in which case it would be like...
[16:24:41] <jphase> $('form').on('formValidated', function(){ if($(this).valid){ // stuff }; });
[16:24:47] <jphase> not sure
[16:25:11] <jphase> oh they also have a validValues method too
[16:27:14] <jphase> their docs aren't very good with their examples
[16:27:29] <jphase> that might not be an event on the form, but rather the h5Validate object...
[16:27:39] <VCoolio> I'm getting fed up with h5validate :), do you know an easy way to have the validation plugin check on html5 pattern= criteria?
[16:27:44] <jphase> instead of $('form') it'd be $.h5Validate.on('formValidated' type thing
[16:28:05] <VCoolio> ah, that I didn't try yet
[16:28:42] <jphase> "A validity object is passed into the event handler containing:"
[16:28:48] <jphase> that means that the function part would be like...
[16:29:13] <jphase> $.h5Validate.on('formValidated', function(isvalid){ if(isvalid.valid){ // stuff }; });
[16:38:01] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: ready for ya, let me switch from node to apache real quick\
[16:38:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[16:38:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> private convo?
[16:38:33] <jphase> yeah, don't want php stuff to make anyone mad :)
[16:42:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol the jquery 1 time gonna be on our butts
[16:42:38] <VCoolio> thanks for helping jphase, no success yet, but bedtime
[17:09:54] <Atlantic777> var button = $('<li><a data-url="'+this+'">'+this+'</a></li>'); console.log(this); console.log(button.data('url'));
[17:10:11] <Atlantic777> fir log output has ok value
[17:10:15] <Atlantic777> second one is undefined
[17:10:19] <Atlantic777> Am I doing something wrong?
[17:10:28] <jphase> hmm, what are you trying to log?
[17:10:35] <jphase> on the first?
[17:10:49] <Atlantic777> It's a string.
[17:11:07] <Atlantic777> I have an array of strings through which I iterate with $.each()
[17:11:16] <jphase> then use $(this) instead of this
[17:17:15] <BillCriswell> php? arrgghhh
[17:18:39] <Atlantic777> jphase: the problem seems to be that this refers to the <li>, not to the <a>
[17:19:17] <Atlantic777> but that's in another function
[17:19:23] <Atlantic777> nevermind
[17:24:31] <BillCriswell> .5 hours.
[17:24:46] <jphase> eh?
[17:25:19] <Atlantic777> wee, it works :)
[17:25:29] <jphase> :D
[17:26:14] <Atlantic777> jQuery UI and jQuery mobile make me feel as I am able to design something user friendly.
[17:34:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> Atlantic777: i personally prefer to design all my "ui" components from scratch and the mobile content as well....makes me feel like im in control
[18:07:45] <i8igmac> can some one help with swftools? im trying to embed movie files with play and pause button
[18:11:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: bro do you have the link for the fiddle that you created with the 140 length array?
[18:12:39] <Velveeta> i *might* in my history, but it's gonna be lost in a sea of jsfiddle links……. i never created one specifically for a 140-length array, the biggest i did was 50
[18:13:11] <Velveeta> gimme a few minutes though, i have to go babysit the grill real quick
[18:16:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: okay will wait....even if you did it with 50 thats good enough......i think you may have solved my problem without knowing it
[18:18:27] <jphase> boooya, monokai theme for iTerm 2 is pwnsauce!
[18:18:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: bro monokai goes well with any program
[18:18:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> you cant argue that
[18:19:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> im actually considering making a light and dark flat ui kit based on it
[18:30:40] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: http://jsfiddle.net/AuNWD/8/
[18:31:04] <Velveeta> you might want to try incrementing numbers on the end of that until it stops displaying stuff, so you can make sure you have the latest iteration of it
[18:31:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[18:31:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> thanks again
[18:31:20] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[18:33:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: quick question can you do something like $("div").html(assassins);
[18:33:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> where assassins is an array
[18:34:23] <Velveeta> if you do that, the html will read [object Array] or something
[18:34:43] <Velveeta> you'd want to do something like: $('div').html(assassins.join(', '));
[18:35:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> it just reads out all the numbers
[18:35:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> oaky ill try that
[18:36:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> thx :)
[18:41:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: i seem to be missing someting
[18:41:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> can you check quickly
[18:41:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/AuNWD/13/
[18:42:46] <sammych> hay all. I'm curious, can you edit values inside a closure during runtime with the devtools/console?
[18:43:05] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: "int j=0" should be "var j=0"
[18:43:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh shit wow
[18:43:20] <sammych> I'm asking because part of the 'truth' of my data resides in the app
[18:43:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> im still in java mode
[18:43:26] <jphase> hehe
[18:43:31] <jphase> I do that all the time with php
[18:43:33] <sammych> don't worry, I'm sure we've all done that
[18:44:01] <jphase> sammych: yeah you can I believe
[18:44:19] <jphase> sammych: they have to be in global namespace though or something
[18:44:38] <sammych> the data is inside a closure
[18:45:59] <sammych> safely out of the way of window
[18:46:37] <sammych> but I realise now I have other issues, such the user being able to modify data-attributes
[18:46:53] <sammych> I might just have to convert to data() instead
[18:46:59] <sammych> less obvious
[18:48:01] <jphase> definitely a good use for .data()
[18:48:17] <Velveeta> sammych: did you get an answer yet?
[18:48:26] <sammych> yes and no
[18:48:28] <Velveeta> sorry, i just got back from the grill
[18:48:37] <Velveeta> which by the way, you guys are totally missing out on
[18:48:44] <sammych> answer for the question I just asked like 3 minutes ago?
[18:48:48] <jphase> as soon as you said grill I was pissed
[18:49:06] <sammych> eh, I have a big steak like every other day
[18:49:24] <jphase> that's what she said...  baZINGa
[18:49:24] <Velveeta> sammych: that's the life
[18:49:33] <Velveeta> and i'm from texas, so to say that i'm jealous really is something
[18:49:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol and we will soon find that out when you reach the hospital when you arteries clog :)
[18:50:00] <Velveeta> no no, i have artery brushes
[18:50:03] <Velveeta> it's all good
[18:50:06] <jphase> lol
[18:50:08] <sammych> hehe
[18:50:09] <jphase> they make those?
[18:50:18] <jphase> they need heart nanites that just clean up shit in there
[18:50:22] <Velveeta> sure, you push em in through a stent
[18:50:31] <Velveeta> jphase: ^^ your idea
[18:50:47] <sammych> sorry to break the grill moment
[18:50:53] <Velveeta> somebody contact wesley crusher and make that a thing
[18:50:55] <sammych> but Velveeta, did you have any input?
[18:51:05] <Velveeta> sammych: well it depends on what answer you got so far
[18:51:31] <sammych> 'as long as it's not in the global namespace'
[18:51:40] <sammych> which it is
[18:51:42] <sammych> itn's*(
[18:51:44] <sammych> isn't*
[18:51:47] <sammych> gotcha
[18:52:01] <Velveeta> so, you have data, inside a closure, that you *want* to modify? or that you want to see if it can *be* modified?
[18:52:23] <sammych> I want to know if it's possible
[18:52:32] <Andrevan> ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE WITH JQUERY!
[18:52:36] <sammych> not really
[18:52:36] <Velveeta> it's certainly possible
[18:52:44] <Velveeta> andrevan: *highfive*
[18:52:46] <Andrevan> :D
[18:52:52] <Velveeta> oh it's totally possible with breakpoints :D
[18:53:01] <sammych> yeah, that's my thinking
[18:53:11] <Velveeta> i do that shit all the time to debug other peoples' problems
[18:53:15] <jphase> yeah, and sammych, I said if it *is* in global namespace ;)
[18:53:39] <Velveeta> now, if you expose something into the global namespace, that's an entirely different beast… then they don't even need a breakpoint
[18:53:40] <sammych> yeah, my bad
[18:53:50] <sammych> yeah, I get all that
[18:53:52] <jphase> I knew what you meant
[18:54:05] <jphase> but yeah, break points ftw
[18:54:14] <jphase> annoying to step through if there's several iterations, but ...
[18:54:16] <jphase> meh
[18:54:24] <sammych> I can't even set a breakpoint when viewing this file though
[18:54:31] <Velveeta> that's when *conditional* breakpoints come in handy ;)
[18:54:38] <jphase> oh right
[18:54:40] <jphase> touché
[18:55:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/Qu3gx/2/
[18:55:20] <sammych> oh right, I see now
[18:55:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> whats the bug cant find it
[18:55:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> sry here: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/Qu3gx/3/
[18:55:41] <jphase> include jQuery
[18:55:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> nvm found it
[18:55:45] <jphase> ;]
[18:55:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[18:55:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> fuck now i feel stupid
[18:56:05] <jphase> nah, it's just hard to get accustomed to working with fiddle
[18:56:09] <sammych> :)
[18:56:12] <jphase> when I refresh I always forget that
[18:56:30] <jphase> I'm used to all my resources being at my beckon call
[18:56:59] <sammych> crap
[18:57:29] <sammych> good thing my target users (it's an internal company thing) aren't likely to know these things
[18:57:58] <sammych> might have to build in more validation. Pain.
[18:58:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[18:58:02] <sammych> server-side*
[18:58:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay if I initialize an array as such: var assassins = [];
[18:58:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> can i set the assassins[118] value
[18:59:01] <jphase> yeah
[18:59:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[18:59:59] <sammych> yeah, but if you print it, it'll go [undefined,undefined,undefined,undefined,undefined,...value]
[19:00:56] <sammych> use an object
[19:02:12] <sammych> right, now I know why I didn't want to use data() in the first place, it's because I have to generate the HTML, then append it, only then I can use data()
[19:03:39] <sammych> maybe I can do something ridiculous like mark it as needing data-ering, then I'll just append it, and turn all the 'data' attrs into data() members
[19:03:56] <sammych> how performant does that sound?
[19:08:42] <sammych> fine, I get it, I'll leave
[19:08:45] <sammych> enjoy my steak
[19:09:04] <sammych> juicy juicy T-Bone
[19:12:38] <beancurd> steak is pretty awesome.
[19:12:53] <jphase> hehe, with beancurd nick that's kinda funny
[19:13:02] <jphase> screenshottable
[19:13:35] <beancurd> soysteak.
[19:13:41] <beancurd> *gasp.
[19:13:46] <jphase> heh
[19:15:45] <__machine> anyone know why jquery would not be following redirects on ajax requests?
[19:16:28] <jphase> __machine: out of curiosity, why is your server side script redirecting?
[19:17:47] <__machine> jphase: because the normal (non-js) behaviour is display a form... on submit validate the form and refresh the page with validation errors... or on success redirect to a confirmation page... im trying to allow communication via JS from a remote domain with as little change to the original application as possible...
[19:18:31] <sammych> argh, why does the console log type filter not work with console.group
[19:19:09] <__machine> jphase: so i have a middleware that when a request is made with ajax it returns the context variables used to render the template as json... instead of a rendered template... so i can easily extract data as json from existing pages without changing the original application... but on success the original application returns a redirect... i want jquery to follow it and give me
[19:19:16] <__machine> the context variables from the target page as json
[19:19:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: say i generate the chainOfKilling array and then i general the assassins array (assassins array is in order from 1 to n)
[19:19:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> is it possible for their to be orphan cases
[19:20:03] <jphase> __machine: I've never actually had my ajax script need to follow a 301 or 302. I guess if I were to do what you are describing I'd return a different object from the server side script and based on that object I'd use a window.location.href or something
[19:21:05] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: Ultimately you could start with the 1 array and randomize it and then the order of that array could be your relationships
[19:21:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> well i build the chain of killing array piece of cake
[19:21:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> creating the other two arrays is proving to be difficult
[19:21:53] <__machine> jphase: i'd need to change every view function in the existing application to return a different response for ajax requests... which tightly couples the application behaviour with the access method (direct vs js/api)... i can return some json instead of a redirect with the value of the redirect headers (e.g. location)... but then it still becomes complicated... in my js i have to
[19:22:10] <__machine> detect a redirect location header and then make a second ajax request in the js code
[19:22:18] <jphase> oic
[19:25:36] <__machine> jphase: i removed all the with credentials stuff and just did a simple cors request (POST with form data is considered "safe" and doesnt need preflight)... same problem... but on same domain (no cors) then jquery does follow the redirect
[19:26:04] <jphase> interesting
[19:30:56] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: I guess I don't understand why the two separate arrays need to exist
[19:31:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> well cuase im putting them into a data base later
[19:31:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmmim jsut thinking
[19:31:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> would it be cumbersome
[19:31:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> for a php script
[19:31:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> to use a .split method
[19:31:44] <jphase> .explode
[19:31:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> or .explode
[19:31:47] <jphase> er
[19:31:49] <jphase> explode()
[19:31:51] <jphase> lol, no .
[19:31:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then write out the values in a table form
[19:32:03] <jphase> pretty easy
[19:32:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> no in terms of laod time
[19:32:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> easy i can do
[19:32:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause if it can be done
[19:32:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> than thats great
[19:32:31] <jphase> well, exploding by what? you're thinking about the string first?
[19:32:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> 'yes
[19:32:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> so i generate the string
[19:32:47] <jphase> it's quicker to have an array of values than to create an array from a string and spit out those values
[19:32:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then i store that to database
[19:33:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> well than how do i store array in database
[19:33:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> no array type
[19:33:17] <jphase> serialize
[19:33:30] <jphase> if you want the entire array in 1 column that is
[19:34:08] <jphase> otherwise you could use a boolean that acts as a flag, loop through 1 main randomized array, and based on the toggle that index is an assassin or target
[19:34:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> but isnt serializing the same as generating a long string separated by commas  when it comes to storing the values in a db
[19:35:14] <jphase> well yeah, it's like a minified JSON string basically
[19:35:36] <jphase> I was just saying if you wanted an entire array in the database without columns for each index then that's an option
[19:36:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> well i store a bunch of data
[19:36:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> how i was doing it before
[19:36:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> was storing the assasin and his target
[19:36:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> so what i think you mean are rows
[19:36:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> so serialize is like creating a rar
[19:38:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> wait a sec
[19:38:26] <jphase> really a lot of this depends on your data structure, but if the task at hand is to randomize an array of values (assassins and targets in this case), then you could probably just use 1 array
[19:38:51] <jphase> idk, this has gotten to be brain teaser so now I'm thinking about how to rework the thought process and turn it inside out
[19:39:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[19:39:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> quick question while you do that
[19:40:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> for storing serialized strings i would use tpye var char in mysql
[19:40:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> right?
[19:40:18] <jphase> well, probably longtext or something, depends on how big
[19:40:53] <jphase> varchar has a 255 character limit (including the [{,}] type characters)
[19:41:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> ugh thats not gonna fit
[19:42:37] <jphase> yeah so for serialized data it's often good to use longtext or something similar, but you may not want to go with a serialized approach
[19:43:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> whys that?
[19:43:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> i thought serialize saves mem
[19:44:34] <jphase> well it's just a big 'ol string, and the problem with big 'ol strings is that you need to use datatypes like longtext which actually reserves X amount of characters similar to how a byte block on a hard drive reserves space
[19:45:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> ugh
[19:45:25] <jphase> I typically use serialized arrays in database for things that require large data sets to be compared, like history tables consisting of an entire snapshot of rows from another table so I can compare the changes over time
[19:45:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> bottom line?
[19:45:28] <jphase> lol
[19:46:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> ture
[19:46:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> *true
[19:46:29] <jphase> idk, bottom line is we need to resolve orphans in your first though process or rework the way you accomplish what you're doing
[19:46:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> i think there is a need of serialize in this case
[19:46:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: i beleive there is a way with the first approach we jsut need to think of it
[19:47:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> we could just recalculate when an orphan case comes up but thats just messy and will take long for large arrays
[19:47:41] <__machine> jphase: where would be a good place to detect a redirect response (e.g. if i return json {headers: {Location: 'http://domain.com/path/...'}} instead of a 302 redirect) that would allow jquery to make a second request and execute the same handler function on the response of the second ajax request?
[19:48:18] <jphase> __machine: do you only need to have the two potential requests?
[19:48:22] <jphase> or is it recursive?
[19:49:03] <jphase> I mean, either way you can just setup an object or array or whatever and issue another request
[19:49:26] <__machine> it could possibly be recursive but right now it isnt in this case
[19:49:30] <jphase> could place the ajax call in a function wrapper if you needed to use it more than once too
[19:52:43] <__machine> jphase: from inside the success handler... can i access the success handler and other event handlers? i guess those are all set on the jqXHR object? or are they just linked by events? ideally something like ajaxPrefilter or ajaxComplete that would apply to all $.ajax() calls that would be able to detect redirects and make a second request with the same handlers...?
[19:54:34] <jphase> yeah, I suppose you could modify your success events for all .ajax calls
[19:54:48] <jphase> with the .ajaxSuccess method or something?
[19:56:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: the orphan cases can be delt with by checking everytime a random number is added to the targets list whether its opposite is the reverse
[19:56:19] <jphase> then if your ajax submission was in a function wrapper, you could just call that function in your .ajaxSuccess call if there's a header key in your ajax data? So it's recursive until there's no redirect data given back
[19:57:02] <__machine> jphase: would $.ajaxSuccess() fire for all calls to $.ajax() ? would it fire *before* events on individual ajax calls setup with $.ajax().done() ?
[19:57:31] <jphase> "Attach a function to be executed whenever an Ajax request completes successfully"
[19:58:17] <jphase> so it's global until specified otherwise, and it's an equivalent of .succes(function(){});
[19:58:19] <jphase> type thing
[20:00:36] <__machine> so its the same as success() but global... but which one would execute first? because i want to write a different success handler for each individual ajax call... but the redirect detection needs to be in success and it needs to happen before the individual success handler... because the redirect json response wont have any of the data that the individual success handler expects
[20:02:46] <jphase> __machine: can you just have a function sendajax(data){ //$.ajax() call here } and then use $.ajaxSuccess(function(data){ // parse JSON and check to see if you need to call the sendajax function }); ?
[20:03:31] <jphase> to answer your question though, I'm uncertain which fires first if you use both .ajaxSuccess and .success or how that works
[20:03:40] <jphase> I usually only use .success if I use anything
[20:04:11] <jphase> not an answer, rather an admittance of not knowing lol
[20:05:17] <__machine> just tested... $.ajax().done(fn) fires before $(document).ajaxSuccess(fn)... doh...
[20:05:43] <jphase> done is a totally different event though
[20:06:04] <jphase> I thought you were asking if .ajaxSuccess() overrides and/or fires before or after .success()
[20:06:05] <__machine> i thought success was deprecated in favour of done?
[20:06:06] * jphase is confused
[20:06:12] <jphase> oh maybe
[20:06:29] <__machine> error becomes fail, success becomes done, and complete becomes always?
[20:07:09] <__machine> maybe i just have to do... function redirectHandler() {}; $.ajax().done(redirectHandler).done(...) to ensure the redirect handler always fires first... not sure if it can cancel the second done handler though
[20:07:11] <jphase> yeah, guess so, (this is why I always use their aliases when I can)
[20:07:23] <jphase> well that's a bummer then
[20:07:55] <jphase> but if you just put your .ajax call in a function with a parameter, can't you just daisy-chain your ajax calls?
[20:08:25] <jphase> like an ajax call in a recursive function
[20:10:18] <__machine> im not sure i follow... wrap $.ajax() in a function and pass my ajax options to that function... and add my redirect handling in there?
[20:10:46] <jphase> let me write some psuedo code to see if this will work for you
[20:13:49] <jphase> so this is uber ghetto, but w/e
[20:13:49] <jphase> http://pastebin.ws/apfdww
[20:14:23] <jphase> like have a function that calls itself based on the response from the server (can be done with .done, I was just lazy)
[20:14:37] <jphase> and then the initial call is bound to whatever event or what/not
[20:14:38] <jphase> idk
[20:14:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: are you still there?
[20:14:54] <jphase> and data would change perhaps? I don't know much about what data you're using
[20:15:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: can you tell me how i could generate 7 random unique items given an array
[20:16:22] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: wouldn't that just be 7 random numbers that represent the index?
[20:16:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> wel
[20:16:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes I guess ....ya
[20:16:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> so stupid
[20:16:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> its late im tired
[20:16:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> please forgive my stupidity
[20:17:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> problem is they have to be unique
[20:24:47] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: here's a unique randomized array of 8 numbers
[20:25:20] <jphase> length can be changed to match the length of your array or something
[20:26:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmmm
[20:26:57] <jphase> oh that's also from 1 to 100
[20:26:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause as I add the rand strings I want to check for orphans
[20:55:48] <gergesim> Hi all. I was curious if valhooks is part of the offical api. It doesn't seem to be in the documentation
[20:59:27] <jphase> gergesim: it is apparently part of jQuery but there's little to no docs on it
[21:00:08] <jphase> gergesim: there's a github example of using them here: http://daffl.github.io/2011/11/28/valhooks.html
[21:01:05] <gergesim> Thanks jphase. Was hoping to ensure it was supported before bringing into our app
[21:01:30] <jphase> yeah I guess it is, which is news to me, thanks for clearing that one up :)
[21:01:48] <bradleyayers> wat
[21:01:57] <bradleyayers> so is valHooks API or not?
[21:02:25] <jphase> it is, you don't have to include any additional libraries, but if by in the API you mean on their API docs, then no
[21:03:39] <bradleyayers> by API i mean supported, as in it'll be listed as deprecated when it is no longer supported or whatever
[21:05:11] <jphase> well they don't include it in their docs so I'm not sure what their plans are for it
[21:05:30] <bradleyayers> yeah good point
[21:05:35] <jphase> but according to some blogs I'm reading it's natively supported :\
[21:05:53] <bradleyayers> it's mentioned briefly on http://api.jquery.com/val/ but it feels a little sketchy
[21:06:15] <jphase> oh nice
[21:06:23] <jphase> so that's actually more promising than I originally though
[21:06:24] <jphase> +t
[21:06:54] <jphase> "A workaround for this issue..." lol
[21:07:00] <bradleyayers> yeah :/
[21:07:05] <jphase> I wouldn't put money on it yeah haha
[21:17:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: how to determine if i+1 will produce an error names an offset error in a foor loop
[21:17:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> *for
[21:17:42] <jphase> check to see if it's undefined
[21:18:02] <jphase> if(array['val'] != 'undefined')
[21:18:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> in php
[21:18:33] <jphase> er, val would be the key of course, i+1 in your case
[21:18:35] <jphase> it's late
[21:18:35] <jphase> oh
[21:18:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> sry probably wrong place
[21:18:57] <jphase> if(isset($array[$i+1])){
[21:19:00] <jphase> all good
[21:19:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> you sure
[21:19:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> for detecting an error?
[21:19:11] <jphase> oh wait
[21:19:18] <jphase> it's better to use array_key_exists
[21:19:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya i thought so
[21:19:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> php is more organized than that
[21:19:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[21:20:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> thanks
[21:20:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: thinking about turning in?
[21:20:38] <jphase> nah, I got some more stuff to do yet
[21:22:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[21:22:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay i got the thing working
[21:22:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> but had to work in reverse
[21:22:40] <jphase> I had a feeling that was the case
[21:22:48] <jphase> usually when I hit a wall I flip things inside out :)
[21:22:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> its teh only way to prevent orphan case
[21:23:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: lol
[21:23:32] <jphase> like start my next for loops on the other end, tends to always solve the problem
[21:23:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: here what I was thinking for avoiding the orphan case but I think this only works for pairs  (chains less than 3)
[21:23:40] * jphase gives Rohan_Bhangui a high five
[21:23:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> basically check the opposite number
[21:24:34] * Rohan_Bhangui appreciates the help
[21:24:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> only thing I have lef tto do
[21:25:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> is to scramble the assassins list and maintain the same scramlbing steps fo the targets list
[21:26:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> so much left to do for this
[21:26:16] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: make an array of indices and randomize it
[21:26:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> explain
[21:26:50] <jphase> $randex = range(0, count($assassins)-1);  shuffle($randex);
[21:27:10] <jphase> then just foreach it and use the index of the for loop as the index of the assassins array
[21:27:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> wait should i not avoid shufflesince
[21:27:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> *shuffle since it remove sthe key values
[21:27:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> *the
[21:28:01] <jphase> do you have strings for keys?
[21:28:10] <__machine> jphase: sorry i disappeared for lunch and your pastebin has expired now... do you happen to have it around still? :)
[21:28:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: nopnope
[21:28:59] <jphase> __machine: nah I don't, sorry, I can write another out in a bit
[21:29:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> __machine: lunch.....lol its monday morning here
[21:29:24] <__machine> 230pm here
[21:30:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[21:30:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> woah
[21:30:24] <T13|sleeps> Lindsey R from Austin using RoadRunner...
[21:30:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> you must be in like
[21:30:35] <T13|sleeps> Hrmm. Interesting.
[21:30:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> __machine: you must be like where
[21:30:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> uk
[21:30:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> no further
[21:30:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> your like maybe australia
[21:31:03] <__machine> sydney australia
[21:31:09] <T13|sleeps> 12:31am here...
[21:31:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahah got it
[21:31:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> T13|sleeps: same as you
[21:31:57] <T13|sleeps> Canada or Peru?
[21:32:18] <__machine> jphase: could i use ajaxPrefilter to replace success with a new handler that first checks for redirect and if not found then it calls the original success?
[21:32:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> canada
[21:33:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> bro
[21:33:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> proud
[21:33:22] <T13|sleeps> Ahh. So just north of me.
[21:33:35] <jphase> __machine: sure, you just need to wrap part of it in a function and call it based on the return from your ajax
[21:34:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> T13|sleeps: and you are where?
[21:34:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> peru im guessing
[21:34:38] <T13|sleeps> Meh.. I need to call a recursive .ajax tomorrow.. fun.
[21:34:42] <T13|sleeps> ME
[21:40:06] <jphase> __machine: do you need to change the data you send on subsequent ajax calls?
[21:40:26] <Velveeta> oh……… breaking bad…………………. i'll miss you
[21:40:34] <jphase> :~[
[21:40:55] <Velveeta> wait what? recursive $.ajax?
[21:40:59] <__machine> jphase: if its following a redirect it probably should not send the same data... just do a GET on the redirect target and call the same success handler on the json response data
[21:40:59] <Velveeta> say it ain't so!
[21:41:01] <jphase> yeah lol
[21:41:12] <jphase> i figured
[21:41:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: it was a good series :(
[21:42:18] <Velveeta> it was fantabulous
[21:44:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: what else do you watch?
[21:44:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: fyi I solved the chain of killing issue by working in the reverse way
[21:45:36] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: game of thrones, walking dead, orange is the new black, star trek: anything
[21:46:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> nice
[21:46:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> you watch the mentalist
[21:46:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> hawaii fiveo
[21:46:46] <jphase> __machine: this would of course need to be modified a bunch to work but here's a psuedo-code example http://pastebin.mozilla.org/3170006
[22:13:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: im gonna hit hay...will probably bump into you tom. Let me know about any developments on that internship and thanks again for speaking with your friend. It is hard to find honest and helpful people these days
[22:16:20] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: oh snap I stepped away. alright man, good job crackin' out. I'll let you know what he says.
[22:16:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> thanks
[22:16:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> take it easy
[22:16:43] <jphase> you too man, caio
[22:16:45] <jphase> ciao*
[22:16:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> cya
[22:21:11] <cadz> Hi anyone here?
[22:21:17] <jphase> mhm
[22:21:58] <cadz> Guys i need to understand what this means -> " fileElementId: the file type of input element id and it will be the index of  $_FILES Array()" That is from ajaxFileUpload plugin.
[22:22:49] <cadz> please
[22:23:26] <jphase> yeah, so when you have a file input, it will post to a $_FILES array in PHP
[22:23:39] <cadz> jphase: what if im using perl?
[22:24:22] <cadz> the plugin doesnt have much documentation or demo, so im not sure if i can pass multiple names in that parameter
[22:24:24] <jphase> cadz: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/512738/what-is-the-perl-equivalent-for-phps-files-for-file-uploads
[22:24:44] <cadz> jphase: another question, can i put an array there? or name types only?
[22:25:04] <jphase> an array will come to your server side script based on how you build your file elements
[22:25:27] <jphase> you can have HTML element arrays with some sort of [] after the name attribute and it will come to your script as that array
[22:25:52] <jphase> <input type="file" name="images[]"> for example
[22:26:01] <cadz> jphase: that is exactly how i built it, so i only pass the name? example nameonly? not nameonly[]?
[22:26:14] <jphase> and there's multiple="multiple" on file elements
[22:26:14] <cadz> and perl will see it as an array?
[22:26:17] <cadz> yes
[22:26:19] <cadz> there is
[22:26:22] <cadz> multiple
[22:26:39] <jphase> yeah, just the name without []
[22:26:43] <jphase> and it will come as an array
[22:26:52] <cadz> jphase: you sir, are a genius
[22:26:55] <cadz> thanks a lot
[22:26:59] <jphase> np man
[22:30:22] <cadz> jphase: another question man, because you might think that i have one <input type='file' multiple='multiple' />. But i have multiple <input='type' name='file[]' /> is it still applicable? your suggestion?
[22:30:58] <cadz> ***<input type='file' > i have multiple of this one
[22:36:23] <jphase> one input with multiple attribute should still be named with [] and the form needs to have multipart form data enctype attribute, but either way works too
[22:36:46] <jphase> if you wanted several single file inputs with a name[] that would also come as an array
[22:37:13] <jphase> I prefer one multiple input
[22:37:18] <jphase> but all up to you really
[22:39:11] <cadz> jphase: this is really complicated, because i have several single file inputs which is not wrapped in a form, so no multipart, it is passed through that ajaxFileUpload plugin, that is why i am asking what possible values can i pass on that paramter?  THIS ONE --->>> fileElementId: the file type of input element id and it will be the index of  $_FILES Array()
[22:40:02] <jphase> ahh right, I've used that once or twice before but it's been awhile
[22:40:10] * jphase tries to remember which client
[23:09:01] <jtm> I am having a big big big big big big issue with trying to select text in an input box for mobile. I have the input box set to readonly, but when I "tap" the input box it doesn't highlight any text for me. It works fine in desktop though.
[23:10:49] <jtm> Here is the jsfiddle for what I am talking about: http://jsfiddle.net/hWeUA/
[23:11:07] <jtm> It works correctly on desktop, but not for mobile.
[23:11:18] <jtm> by mobile, I mean iOS 7 with Chrome.
[23:12:30] <jphase> jtm: hmm, works on my Android device but I suppose I could emulate it to try to reproduce
[23:12:43] <jphase> I also use chrome on my mobile so idk
[23:13:02] <jtm> iOS is simply doing nothing when I tap it.
[23:14:19] <jphase> jtm: have you tried removing your 1-time mouseup binding there to see if it's different?
[23:15:21] <jtm> Yes
[23:22:48] <jphase> jtm: are you using jQuery mobile or no?
[23:32:21] <jtm> jphase No
[23:33:38] <jphase> jtm: well I can definitely reproduce the problem on iOS 5 but I dunno why it's not working either... odd
[23:34:11] <jtm> I was able to make it work properly by doing
[23:34:32] <jtm> onkeydown="event.preventDefault();event.stopPropagation();return false;"  oncut="event.preventDefault();event.stopPropagation();return false;"  on the inputbox
[23:34:45] <jtm> To simulate readonly
[23:35:02] <jtm> It must be a bug on iOS with readonly and Webkit
[23:35:16] <jtm> So I ran into another issue that you may actually be able to help with this time :)
[23:35:25] <jtm> When I click it now, it selects the text
[23:35:44] <jtm> but it doesn't show the copy option, so I have to reselect it
[23:36:42] <dopie> Hey all
[23:36:53] <jphase> hi
[23:37:13] <jtm> fixed it by swapping it from focus to click
[23:37:29] <jphase> nice :D
[23:39:51] <jphase> alright, I gotta call it a night
[23:39:56] <jphase> ciao folks
[23:55:13] <__machine> in my $.ajax().done(function (data, statusText, jqXHR) {}) handler) ... if i assign to data... will it change by reference and be available in the $.ajax() scope?
[23:58:58] <xec> __machine: nope
[23:59:18] <xec> it will change what your local data var points to...
[23:59:52] <__machine> xec: hmm... so i want to write a function that i pass data to... and it alters that data in-place... is it possible?
