[10:24:58] <jak2000> hi all
[10:25:16] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/pcmgfhtk/   <----- ho to add a row... only if String not exist?
[10:53:55] <jak2000> hi
[11:25:22] <jak2000> any advice?
[12:48:38] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 did you figure out your question earlier?
[18:55:00] <sine0> hey folks. with input/option .on('change' triggers after i click away from the field. is there a way to have a trigger when the content of the field is being edited, as in any input
[18:55:14] <robertmaxrees> the 'input' event.
[18:55:47] <sine0> haha that was easy!
[18:56:02] <sine0> thanks
[18:59:33] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:02:45] <sine0> when you get php associative arrays back in ajax do you have to convert to json before it comes back or does it happen automatically, I want to access the respose.price
[19:02:55] <sine0> response.price
[19:03:00] <robertmaxrees> "back"?
[19:03:16] <robertmaxrees> you mean the PHP is responding with an associative array?
[19:03:31] <sine0> es
[19:03:52] <robertmaxrees> JS doesn't understand PHP, so the server needs to send JSON.
[19:03:55] <sine0> ok
[19:04:47] <robertmaxrees> and then the JS would send JSON back and the PHP would convert it again.
[19:08:56] <sine0> robertmaxrees: I have been messing around with this bit of jquery ajax and php function for a while. the way the function returns the call is via a "echo var_dump($var); die();"
[19:09:26] <sine0> does that seem hacky/messy to you are is that the way
[19:09:40] <robertmaxrees> i don't know PHP but that seems hacky to me.
[19:10:40] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/4064468/923919 looks relevant.
[19:11:26] <robertmaxrees> also i seem to recall that using die() in php was generally a code smell but like i said, not familiar with it.
