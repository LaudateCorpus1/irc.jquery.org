[00:03:14] <SuperPhly> Hey folks, I need to run a set of tests on a website... it needs to be automated though. I've tried using selenium, but it's kinda buggy. I'd rather write my tests by hand, using javascript possibly. Do you guys know of a plugin for chrome or something that can do repetitive tasks?
[00:27:46] <edoop> Hi jphase. Yes  i m asking for  a timeline.
[00:28:04] <cthdrlComputer> anyone here?
[00:28:07] <edoop> with a good  optimization.
[00:28:15] <cthdrlComputer> woohoo!
[00:28:18] * jphase looks at the list of folks ---->
[00:28:44] <edoop> But. i have a skills to make it . i need the optimal method with jquery.
[00:28:45] <jphase> edoop: optimization meaning SEO, load time, or?
[00:28:51] <edoop> Load-time
[00:28:58] <edoop> :9
[00:29:03] <edoop> May be 100years and more
[00:29:15] <jphase> well if you have the skills to make it, then just make it :)
[00:29:28] <edoop> Sure.. but i want your opinion to make it with jquery
[00:29:37] <edoop> i m not active developer
[00:29:44] <edoop> :( i'm leaving from years
[00:30:00] <edoop> i have actionscript challanging past experience and lamp
[00:30:22] <edoop> and i meant interaction on embeded and oop
[00:30:52] <jphase> well try the one I linked
[00:31:10] <edoop> Ah your suggestin in the history rows?
[00:31:17] <jphase> it's iframe based and hosted on their site. can't recall if they use a CDN or not but other folks use them often
[00:31:25] <jphase> data is managed through Google Docs
[00:31:35] <edoop> jpphase have a showcase that i can see for inspiration?
[00:32:04] <edoop> i want learn more about quantitative optimization
[00:32:15] <jphase> edoop: http://timeline.knightlab.com/
[00:32:21] <edoop> using jquery or other browserbased javascript engine
[00:33:21] <edoop> Yesss thank
[00:33:22] <edoop> :)
[00:33:36] <edoop> But.. it hasn't a big quantitative data in the timeframe
[00:33:37] <edoop> eheh
[00:33:52] <edoop> Is a good solution to drag and plot levels.
[00:34:27] <edoop> But i want to learn more about preloading on each time in visible drag zone
[00:34:32] <cthdrlComputer> alright...I'm going crazy here. I have a twitter bootstrap tab pane going on. awhile ago I had three nav items, with three tab boxes. I didn't have the content for one, so I just removed the link for the time being. I re-added the link, but I can no longer view the tabbed box. This is a live version of it: http://www.anjunoodlebar.com (the menu section) The other two sections still work, just not the third
[00:35:08] <edoop> ok. i think that i have do it
[00:35:14] <edoop> :) using some element
[00:35:46] <edoop> that i could look in the jquery methods and extension
[00:36:31] <cthdrlComputer> obviously the offending item is the menu section, with "Lunch" not working
[00:40:10] <aro> anyone know why when i include a js file once, when i click an item that i have a click handler bound to - it fires three times?
[00:41:50] <Noor_egy> hello im using jquery ui tabs and i load content via ajax i face propleme that the javascript in the content not work
[00:43:39] <Noor_egy> ?
[00:45:51] <rickert> you mean events dont work?
[00:46:34] <Cork> aro: the selector might find the element and a few of its parents for example
[00:46:37] <rickert> for example a click event in a click event on a ajax loaded element
[00:48:45] <rickert> Noor_egy?
[00:49:04] <Noor_egy> well the content is loaded
[00:49:06] <Noor_egy> the html
[00:49:20] <Noor_egy> and it also have javascript code with the content that loaded
[00:49:26] <Noor_egy> but the js not run
[00:49:45] <rickert> you mean you have js in the ajax content with a <script> tag?
[00:50:02] <Noor_egy> yes
[00:50:15] <rickert> is there maybe an error?
[00:50:51] <Noor_egy> no
[00:50:54] <Noor_egy> umm
[00:51:00] <Noor_egy> it works right
[00:51:39] <Noor_egy> 1 minut may be erro
[00:51:47] <rickert> So there is no error? but the js you load with ajax don't work
[00:52:04] <rickert> Do you maybe use $(document).ready?
[00:52:41] <Noor_egy> yes
[00:52:43] <Noor_egy> i do
[00:52:51] <Noor_egy> $(function(){
[00:52:52] <rickert> that is the problem
[00:53:04] <Cork> uh
[00:53:12] <Cork> it shouldn'
[00:53:19] <Cork> *'t cause a problem
[00:53:34] <Cork> you won't get the ready effect
[00:53:39] <Cork> but the code will still run
[00:53:44] <rickert> oke
[00:53:47] <Noor_egy> umm
[00:53:54] <Noor_egy> so if i used jquery
[00:53:59] <Noor_egy> and events action
[00:54:00] <Cork> you have to make sure that the html is added BEFORE the code though
[00:54:03] <Noor_egy> does it will run
[00:54:14] <Cork> Noor_egy: no no event
[00:54:16] <Noor_egy> yes i put the code at the end
[00:54:20] <Noor_egy> umm
[00:54:24] <Noor_egy> so it have events
[00:54:26] <Cork> but if you call ready after a page load it will fire directly
[00:54:33] <Noor_egy> $(".button").click(function(){
[00:54:35] <Cork> (sync)
[00:54:45] <Noor_egy> and using that
[00:54:45] <Noor_egy> $(".button").click(function(){
[00:54:49] <Noor_egy> is it will work
[00:55:09] <Noor_egy> and i dont add html or body tags
[00:55:10] <rickert> zo when you click the .button
[00:55:14] <rickert> it does nothing?
[00:55:18] <Noor_egy> yes
[00:55:39] <rickert> you sure the element has the right class name?
[00:55:40] <Noor_egy> and dont added jquery file in the new content only the event function
[00:55:45] <Noor_egy> yes
[00:56:24] <rickert> Try this: $(document).on("click",".button",function(){
[00:57:02] <rickert> does that work?
[00:58:10] <Noor_egy> no
[01:00:48] <Noor_egy1> sorry disconected
[01:00:59] <Noor_egy1> (10:58:49 AM) Noor_egy: btw i added alert at $(".button").click(function(){
[01:00:59] <Noor_egy1> (10:58:52 AM) Noor_egy: and it worked
[01:03:44] <Noor_egy1> ok i think i get closer to the propleme
[01:03:52] <Noor_egy1> the function im use is work
[01:03:56] <Noor_egy1> but
[01:04:12] <rickert> whats in the function?
[01:04:14] <Noor_egy1> it dont get attributes from elements that loaded from ajax
[01:04:23] <Noor_egy1> the event functiom
[01:04:51] <rickert> yes whats within the function(){
[01:05:02] <Noor_egy1> $(this).attr('prefered');
[01:05:07] <Noor_egy1> 1 minut
[01:07:11] <Noor_egy1> http://jsbin.com/feyujixe/1/edit
[01:08:33] <Noor_egy1> all that form and the contact button is loaded by ajax
[01:08:36] <Noor_egy1> in the tab
[01:10:26] <Noor_egy1> this is what not work
[01:10:27] <Noor_egy1> $("#contactmethod").append(options).trigger('change');
[01:10:47] <rickert> my chrome say there are errors
[01:11:22] <rickert> Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[01:12:22] <rickert> oww you forgot the jquery but hen i click the contact button
[01:12:27] <rickert> it is loading AJAX
[01:12:46] <Noor_egy1> $("#contactdetail").val($('option:selected', this).attr('rel'));
[01:12:52] <Noor_egy1> is there is mistake in that
[01:12:53] <Noor_egy1> ?
[01:14:20] <rickert> i dont zee a dropdown with the id contactdetails
[01:14:35] <rickert> *see
[01:14:39] <Cork> $('option:selected', this) <-- this won't be in relation to the dropdown either
[01:15:12] <Noor_egy1> contactdetail is text box
[01:15:51] <Cork> opps scratch my comment
[01:15:52] <rickert> and you need the value of this textbox?
[01:16:21] <Noor_egy1> well i get the attribute rel from the drop menu and put it in the textbox
[01:16:32] <Noor_egy1> so i used
[01:16:32] <Noor_egy1> $("#contactdetail").val($('option:selected', this).attr('rel'));
[01:16:42] <Noor_egy1> in
[01:16:47] <Noor_egy1> $("#contactmethod").on('change',function(){
[01:17:00] <Noor_egy1> contactmethod => drop down
[01:17:10] <Noor_egy1> $("#contactdetail").=>text box
[01:17:23] <Noor_egy1> umm it get the value but dont put it in textbox
[01:18:20] <Cork> Noor_egy1: console.log($("#contactdetail").length) gives you?
[01:18:32] <Cork> (also don't use alert for debugging)
[01:18:45] <Noor_egy1> i used alert
[01:19:11] <rickert> and why dont you use the data tag?
[01:19:28] <Cork> *attribute
[01:19:41] <Noor_egy1> data tag ?
[01:19:47] <rickert> data attribute
[01:20:02] <Noor_egy1> didnt get u
[01:20:04] <Cork> you can prefix any name with data-
[01:20:09] <Cork> and it is allowed in the spec
[01:20:12] <rickert> For example you add data-modile
[01:20:26] <rickert> data-mobile*
[01:20:31] <Noor_egy1> Cork->$("#contactdetail").length give 1
[01:20:39] <Noor_egy1> whats the deffrent
[01:20:42] <Noor_egy1> umm
[01:20:48] <rickert> <div data-mobile="foo"/>
[01:21:08] <rickert> $('div').data('mobile');
[01:21:11] <rickert> you get the data
[01:21:21] <Noor_egy1> ah
[01:21:23] <Noor_egy1> got u
[01:22:18] <Noor_egy1> umm but the propleme not that i dont get the data from attribute
[01:22:48] <Noor_egy1> the propleme that it dont put as value in the textbox
[01:23:35] <Cork> Noor_egy1: and console.log($('[id="contactdetail']').length) ?
[01:23:41] <Cork> opps
[01:23:46] <Cork> Noor_egy1: * and console.log($('[id="contactdetail"]').length) ?
[01:24:12] <rickert> $('option:selected', this).attr('rel') that does give a value
[01:24:29] <Noor_egy1> console.log($('[id="contactdetail"]').length)  -> give nothing
[01:25:07] <Noor_egy1> umm sorry
[01:25:09] <rickert> $("#contactdetail").val('the vakue should be:'+$('option:selected', this).attr('rel'));
[01:25:11] <rickert> that that
[01:25:13] <Noor_egy1> it gives 2 in alert
[01:25:26] <rickert> *value
[01:26:01] <Cork> Noor_egy1: so your problem is that you have invalid ids
[01:26:16] <Cork> you have two textareas with the same id
[01:26:27] <Cork> and ids has to be unique
[01:27:28] <Cork> Noor_egy1: also open your browser console
[01:27:40] <Cork> so you can use the console.log output instead of alert()
[01:27:45] <Noor_egy1> im using firebug
[01:28:03] <rickert> firebug has a console aswell
[01:28:08] <Cork> ya
[01:28:26] <rickert> but console.log can handle data better than alert
[01:28:29] <Cork> alerts is really problematic when debugging
[01:28:45] <Cork> and it is deadlocking in some cases
[01:28:47] <rickert> (and alerts are annoying)
[01:29:07] <Cork> $(window).on('resize', function() { alert(""); }); => dead browser
[02:02:12] <mukesh> need help for xhr progress bar showing on uploading
[02:02:28] <mukesh> how yo do this
[02:42:51] <timkofu> hi
[02:43:46] <timkofu> I dont want to wait for the document to load
[02:43:52] <timkofu> so I did this
[02:43:56] <timkofu> http://dpaste.com/2K0SDDG
[02:44:01] <timkofu> but that doesnt work
[02:44:26] <timkofu> what's the right way to just run code without waiting for the entire document to load?
[02:47:05] <star_prone> timkofu: where on the page did you placed that code?
[02:47:19] <timkofu> star_prone: head
[02:47:35] <timkofu> star_prone: ... are you thinking is should make it part of the element?
[02:47:43] <timkofu> *i
[02:48:12] <Cork> timkofu: you should use the ready event
[02:48:22] <Cork> then it will attach as soon as the dom is parsed
[02:48:27] <Cork> but before it is drawn
[02:48:30] <star_prone> timkofu: well... it's normal it doesn't work since at that stage the element identified by that id wasn't yet loaded on the page
[02:48:40] <star_prone> Cork^^
[02:48:44] <star_prone> what Cork said
[02:50:08] <timkofu> Cork: the usual $('document').ready(function(){};);?
[02:50:20] <Cork> except the extra ; ya
[02:52:45] <timkofu> Cork: heh, the whole issue was I was loading bootstrap before jquery, so bootstrap would find no class in that element, then jquery would load and change it as the user watched
[02:53:00] <timkofu> Cork: loading jquery first fixed it
[02:54:06] <AL13N_work> i have a .ajax() issue... it seems that when i execute multiple .ajax() calls at the same time, i get wrong context and/or wrong url or whatever...
[02:54:19] <AL13N_work> is there an issue with .ajax that it's not threadsafe?
[02:55:25] <Cork> AL13N_work: no
[02:55:34] <Cork> AL13N_work: and again js isn't threaded
[02:56:02] <AL13N_work> i wonder why i'm getting the wrong results failed...
[02:56:12] <Cork> race?
[02:56:17] <Cork> you might be using a global variable
[02:56:45] <Cork> AL13N_work: it would help if you showed the code
[02:57:57] <AL13N_work> i did a function (e, success) { $(this).ajax({context: this, url: $(this).data('url'), onsuccess: success }); }
[02:58:25] <AL13N_work> can't exactly make a reproducer due to internal ajax calls, but i'll show the code
[02:58:52] <Cork> $(this).ajax <-- this doesn't work
[02:59:50] <AL13N_work> ah, of course, sorry
[02:59:57] <AL13N_work> here's the real code: http://jsfiddle.net/FX7xV/
[03:00:20] <AL13N_work> i'm triggering this for each tr
[03:01:11] <AL13N_work> I have 3 trs, the first one should work, the other 2 need to fail, but randomly, the wrong ones get marked as fail
[03:02:38] <Cork> AL13N_work: well as it is quite partial code it is hard to say why it breaks
[03:02:46] <Cork> but the problem is not with $.ajax
[03:02:52] <AL13N_work> Cork: firefox console shows me that #1 works (that's correct, because it's patched to allow jsonp) and the other 2 don't, (they are not patched yet)
[03:03:20] <AL13N_work> Cork: the context variable is ok?
[03:03:23] <Cork> uh #1 and #2 ?
[03:03:33] <Cork> it is valid
[03:03:37] <AL13N_work> Cork: i have 3 trs,
[03:03:40] <Cork> but as i don't fully know what it is
[03:03:53] <AL13N_work> they have data('url') set
[03:03:55] <Cork> ids with pure numbers isn't valid
[03:04:02] <AL13N_work> i know
[03:04:31] <AL13N_work> but the first tr has an url that works, and the second and third have urls that fail (in the ajax)
[03:05:04] <AL13N_work> console.log shows the GET 's and the first url does work, and the second and third fail
[03:06:18] <AL13N_work> bbiab, i'll get the full code
[03:34:03] <bongjovi> Is there any way to use $.get("../ajaxpage/", {foo : bar}, function(data).. where foo  and bar are both variables?
[03:34:29] <bongjovi> even if I have var foo = "bar"; it will still pass foo
[03:36:22] <Cork> bongjovi: not in modern js no
[03:36:28] <decx> var foo = 'bar'; var obj = {}; obj[foo] = 'bar'; $.get("../ajaxpage/", obj
[03:36:32] <Cork> es6 will have it though
[03:37:24] <Cork> {[foo]: bar}
[03:39:29] <bongjovi> Ahh fantastic
[03:39:33] <bongjovi> thanks, perfect.
[03:39:39] <bongjovi> Didn't think about making an object.
[03:40:01] <seutje> {} is making an object already tbh
[03:40:33] <seutje> also, I couldn't help but chuckle at your nickname, cheers!
[03:42:26] <devil_> I'm doing $(el).on('blur', function() {}); how can I check if it's binded ? $(el).data('events') is undefined... using jquery 1.11.0
[03:42:56] <Cork> devil_: there is no official api to check it
[03:43:10] <Cork> but you can use $._data(elm, 'events')
[03:43:23] <Cork> (don't use it outside of debugging though)
[03:44:39] <devil_> the problem is... i'm writing tests and the testable is in an iframe. So I'm waiting for $(iframe).load()
[03:44:58] <BinaryKitten> does that work?
[03:44:58] <devil_> This works fine... but for some reasons the time load fires, iframe scripts have not yet binded blur events to elements
[03:45:58] <Cork> devil_: blur doesn't fire cross documents though
[03:46:07] <Cork> so that might be your problem
[03:46:13] <devil_> i'm not xdomaining
[03:46:21] <Cork> devil_: doesn't matter
[03:46:26] <BinaryKitten> no, but you are x-doc-ing
[03:46:26] <devil_> and the blur works after i've waited for like 400ms
[03:46:48] <Cork> you can't access content cross domain, but events doesn't go cross documents even if you have access
[03:47:42] <devil_> So there's an input inside that iframe..which gets validated on blur and if it's invalid...it gets an class assigned to it "has-error"
[03:48:11] <devil_> i'm just doing focus().val('asda').blur() on that element.. and it works fine AFTER i've waited like 400ms after .load fires
[03:48:21] <Cork> devil_: not sure if the load event from iframe fires before or after the load event on the domain
[03:48:39] <Cork> but that might be your problem
[03:48:53] <devil_> would
[03:49:02] <devil_> $(window.frames['iframe'].document).ready() make any sense?
[03:49:21] <Cork> yes and no
[03:49:27] <Cork> it isn't .document
[03:51:39] <Cork> btw a fun es6 question http://jsfiddle.net/4T6yz/
[03:51:55] <Cork> any guess at what the spec says line 6 should give you?
[04:00:39] <mukesh> need help for progress bar

[04:04:31] <sergey> I need a help with jquery selector. How to select #content or #post-N if no #content where N is unique number and always changes
[04:06:38] <querier> hello, i'm using this code http://puu.sh/9vU87/f600551ba1.png to display a spinner everytime someone click on a link. what i want to do is to set the  body's opacity to 0.3 but i want to display the spinner with 1 as opacity, what am i doing wrong
[04:07:35] <querier> (btw it works but the spinner has 0.3 as opacity aswell
[04:08:02] <keyboSlice> child nodes can't have a higher opacity than their parent
[04:10:06] <keyboSlice> you would be better off appending a translucent mask layer to the body, than changing the opacity of the body, to achieve the result you are after
[04:11:44] <Cork> sergey: well you would have to know the N value, or give them a class or something like that
[04:15:49] <DRSK> Cork » I'm having some issues with http://jsfiddle.net/4tMh2/ <-- when my "data-speed" is close to 1, my movits value (every other frame or whatnot) gets an extreme value which causes flickering - but I can't figure out why it gets the values it does. Any chance you could take a look? Quite possibly got to do with line 92 and 82 for some reason.
[04:16:47] <DRSK> You can see the flickering on the last image there quite well. If you "stop" scrolling you might catch it being completely off (the value that is). But again, I can't understand how
[04:17:37] <Cork> DRSK: i don't have time to dissect the script right now
[04:17:49] <DRSK> Okay no worries thanks though :)
[04:52:09] <PatBateman> hi
[04:52:14] <PatBateman> anyone using redactor js ?
[04:55:56] <AL13N_work> Cork: this is the html + javascript file: http://jsfiddle.net/FX7xV/1/
[04:56:42] <AL13N_work> the point is that i have 3 tr 's with data: BA, DC1 & DC2 ... BA ajax call works and DC1 and DC2 fail
[04:56:58] <AL13N_work> but BA ends up marked down
[04:57:35] <AL13N_work> (by failing, i mean that the onerror gets executed)
[04:59:39] <AL13N_work> it sorta looks like some kind of racecondition happens, or i thought the context was wrong...
[05:00:01] <Cork> wow... you're not going easy on the fake events are you...
[05:01:17] <Cork> AL13N_work: anyway the code doesn't run so i can't really help you
[05:01:32] <AL13N_work> well, the urls are all internal, so you can't reach them
[05:01:33] <Cork> AL13N_work: all i can say is that $.ajax works for me
[05:01:46] <Cork> so it isn't the cause of your problems
[05:01:50] <AL13N_work> in the output, i notice that i see 3 .ajax() start
[05:01:55] <Cork> all the fake events might be though
[05:01:57] <AL13N_work> and then 3 done
[05:01:59] <slax0r> AL13N_work: have you inspected the network tab in dev tools on chrome or firebug on ff?
[05:02:07] <AL13N_work> yes
[05:02:19] <slax0r> take not of what content type ajax is expecting and what it is receiving
[05:02:21] <Cork> slax0r: or the built in dev tools in ff
[05:02:24] <slax0r> note*
[05:02:26] <AL13N_work> in the console, it's clear that the BA succeeds and the DC1 and DC2 one fail
[05:02:30] <slax0r> Cork: ff has that built in now?
[05:02:36] <AL13N_work> i'm using the ff builtins
[05:02:44] <Cork> slax0r: they have had for the last like 15 versions :)
[05:02:54] <slax0r> Cork: oh...I haven't really used ff in ages
[05:02:57] <AL13N_work> it's almost good
[05:03:14] <AL13N_work> but i had too much issues with firebug, so i'm using the internal ones now
[05:03:34] <slax0r> AL13N_work: and ajax error handler will provide you with a full xhr object, as well as thrown error(s) etc
[05:03:39] <Cork> ya, the internal tools break firebug a lot of the time
[05:03:48] <AL13N_work> Cork: anyway, what i see is that i get 3 .ajax() calls and then 3 oncompleted events after each other
[05:03:55] <Cork> slax0r: that is most likely not the problem here
[05:04:09] <AL13N_work> i need things to fail
[05:04:12] <AL13N_work> this is for monitoring
[05:04:20] <AL13N_work> but it tells me BA is failing
[05:04:24] <AL13N_work> and DC1 and DC2 are ok
[05:04:29] <AL13N_work> but it's the other way around
[05:04:33] <slax0r> Cork: what? I really haven't been following through, I just opened his fiddle and closed it again, I don't want to decipher 100 lines of code :)
[05:04:50] <AL13N_work> slax0r: i had a smaller thing first, but Cork told me he needed more
[05:04:59] <Cork> AL13N_work: you most likely have to check what you bind and what functions you reference in the "getview" event
[05:05:15] <Cork> and make sure you don't cross reference handlers from the different situations
[05:05:25] <AL13N_work> but
[05:05:28] <Cork> i suspect something like that is the cause of your problems
[05:05:41] <AL13N_work> i'm using on(..., 'tr', ...)
[05:05:45] <Cork> oh wait
[05:05:48] <AL13N_work> so it's bound once for all trs
[05:05:50] <Cork> i see why you have problems
[05:05:56] <Cork> jsonpCallback: 'parseJSON', <--
[05:05:58] <Cork> this won't work
[05:06:04] <AL13N_work> why not?
[05:06:07] <Cork> you hardcode all the ajax calls to use one function
[05:06:11] <AL13N_work> yes
[05:06:20] <Cork> so how will the system know what response belongs to what request?
[05:06:36] <AL13N_work> because of the onsuccess event?
[05:06:38] <AL13N_work> the context?
[05:06:44] <Cork> var indata = responses[Math.rand()];
[05:06:50] <Cork> AL13N_work: but its jsonp
[05:07:04] <Cork> the succees action is from the call of the function
[05:07:07] <AL13N_work> so, context doesn't and onsuccess doesn't work for jsonp?
[05:07:22] <Cork> your missing the point
[05:07:41] <AL13N_work> apparently
[05:07:48] <Cork> function parseJSON() {}  parseJSON(data1); parseJSON(data2); parseJSON(data3);
[05:07:58] <Cork> ho is parseJSON to know the difference between that and
[05:08:03] <Cork> function parseJSON() {}  parseJSON(data2); parseJSON(data1); parseJSON(data3);
[05:08:18] <Cork> its just jsonp data in a method call
[05:08:35] <AL13N_work> i don't get it
[05:08:44] <Cork> AL13N_work: you need to fix your server to use the function jquery sets
[05:08:56] <Cork> so you get a separate jsonp function for each request
[05:09:06] <AL13N_work> the parseJSON uses return ; to return results to the onsuccess function?
[05:09:09] <Cork> else you will only be able to ever have one pending ajax call at a time
[05:09:25] <Cork> AL13N_work: no parseJSON is the function the script loaded in the jsonp request
[05:09:32] <Cork> uh sorry
[05:09:38] <Cork> jsonp is you load a .js file
[05:09:42] <AL13N_work> right
[05:09:43] <Cork> the fill calls the function you specify
[05:09:51] <Cork> and its first parameter is the json
[05:09:58] <Cork> currently you have one pipe for the data
[05:10:07] <Cork> so you can only every only have one message pending
[05:10:14] <Cork> else you get a random for what data comes in
[05:10:20] <Cork> (depending on network latency)
[05:10:35] <AL13N_work> so you have something like: onsuccess() { return parseJSON(...); }  ?
[05:10:41] <Cork> no
[05:11:15] <Cork> you have something like function(json) { onsuccess.call(opt.context, json); }
[05:11:23] <AL13N_work> oic, so json can't handle multiple calls for each function?
[05:11:25] <Cork> opps
[05:11:30] <Cork> you have something like function parseJSON(json) { onsuccess.call(opt.context, json); }
[05:11:37] <Cork> AL13N_work: json can
[05:11:50] <Cork> json>P< can't
[05:11:52] <AL13N_work> myeah, i need jsonp :-(
[05:11:55] <Cork> as it isn't event based
[05:11:59] <AL13N_work> ic
[05:12:36] <AL13N_work> so jquery in jsonp mode actually recognizes the call depending on what functions are being queued for execution coupled with the actual function name?
[05:12:43] <AL13N_work> and matches it like that?
[05:13:21] <Cork> AL13N_work: jquery created a global function called parseJSON (as you specify it)
[05:13:28] <AL13N_work> i figured the context would make sure and the .ajax() could correctly get the right one magically
[05:13:37] <Cork> and in the function calls back to it self so it can fire the events for $.ajax
[05:13:54] <Cork> AL13N_work: there is no magic in programming
[05:14:06] <AL13N_work> well, i don't know the details, so it's kinda magic :-)
[05:14:09] <AL13N_work> but ok
[05:14:19] <AL13N_work> but, i can't make this work with jsonp at all
[05:14:24] <Cork> also to note var parseJSON = function (results) { return results; }; <-- this one is never used
[05:14:32] <AL13N_work> because each tr does requests of the same time
[05:14:58] <Cork> AL13N_work: you can if you fix your code :)
[05:15:11] <Cork> 1. remove the callCallback pref
[05:15:34] <Cork> 2. config the server to use the function name sent in the request
[05:15:45] <Cork> and it should just work
[05:16:03] <AL13N_work> ah, it's gonna send random functions?
[05:16:07] <Cork> yes
[05:16:08] <K4T> who have some experience with google maps api? I have multiple markers with opened infowindow, I want to prevent closing the infowindow when I click on any marker. How can I achieve it?
[05:16:10] <AL13N_work> ah
[05:16:12] <Cork> else you can't separate them
[05:16:18] <AL13N_work> ok, thanks!
[05:16:35] <AL13N_work> damn, i'm gonna need to patch the server though :-/
[05:16:53] <AL13N_work> but thanks, now i get it
[05:16:54] <Cork> AL13N_work: well it sounds like the server is broken anyway so... :)
[05:17:00] <AL13N_work> no, it didn't do jsonp
[05:17:11] <AL13N_work> i sort of fiddled to convert json output into jsonp
[05:17:14] <Cork> AL13N_work: then this solution won't help you at all
[05:17:17] <AL13N_work> but i don't know enough of jsonp
[05:17:29] <AL13N_work> so, now i just need to fix the server to correctly use jsonp
[05:17:31] <Cork> AL13N_work: cors might be of more help to you
[05:17:36] <AL13N_work> not really
[05:17:49] <Cork> just send json and have the server tell the browser it is allowed to do cross domain calls
[05:17:50] <AL13N_work> in the end, there's gonna be 20 or more servers
[05:18:00] <AL13N_work> i can't configure cors on them all
[05:18:05] <Cork> uh
[05:18:17] <Cork> your going to have 20 json providing servers?
[05:18:33] <AL13N_work> well, this is aggregated internal monitoring
[05:18:47] <AL13N_work> so, we have a bunch of clients and (also our own monitoring servers)
[05:18:48] <Cork> might want to have a server doing the aggregation?
[05:18:57] <AL13N_work> i thought about that too
[05:19:34] <AL13N_work> but, this'll be more direct
[05:19:55] <AL13N_work> in our new build, i can make it do jsonp
[05:20:05] <AL13N_work> so then i update the clients and it'll work
[05:20:27] <Cork> well setting the server to send an additional header
[05:20:30] <AL13N_work> otherwise i'm gonna have to do some manual configuring in the apache for each server
[05:20:37] <Cork> should be just as simple as to make it do proper jsonp
[05:20:59] <Cork> AL13N_work: you can set that header from php (or what ever) too
[05:21:11] <AL13N_work> it's not that complicated, it's just that upgrades would lose the configuration from apache
[05:21:20] <AL13N_work> Cork: true
[05:21:35] <AL13N_work> but there's also basicauthentication
[05:21:40] <Cork> jsonp is a hack to start with
[05:21:43] <AL13N_work> whcih means i'd have to fix the OPTION calls as well
[05:21:50] <AL13N_work> jsonp is a hack, that's for sure
[05:22:08] <AL13N_work> but it's only for us, so, and it'll take less time, so...
[05:22:27] <AL13N_work> though i didn't expect this of course
[05:22:30] <Cork> less time??
[05:22:34] <AL13N_work> myeah
[05:22:35] <Cork> seriously?
[05:22:54] <Cork> <?php header(''); ?> is about all you need...
[05:23:03] <AL13N_work> yes, for that call
[05:23:26] <AL13N_work> but also auth + OPTIONS (which is not working right now)
[05:23:43] <AL13N_work> the server doesn't respond to pre-flight
[05:23:45] <AL13N_work> anyway
[05:23:49] <Cork> basic auth is a pain in browsers
[05:23:53] <AL13N_work> yes
[05:24:04] <Cork> or specifically loggin the user out again
[05:24:06] <AL13N_work> anyway, thanks for all the explanation
[05:31:44] <logikos> I'm having an issue with using *:not(.someclass) http://codepen.io/Logikos/pen/wgoip
[05:32:12] <logikos> if i change it to li:not(.template) it works but not with *, the reason i'm useing * is because i do not know for sure that the markup will always be the same
[05:32:28] <logikos> i'm just trying to exclude cases where .template is a parent
[05:32:43] <logikos> or grandparent or above etc
[05:38:09] <decx> use filter
[05:38:29] <logikos> ty
[05:38:42] <decx> filter(function(){ return !$(this).closest('.template').length })
[05:39:29] <logikos> oh
[05:39:47] <logikos> i could just as easily out that condition inside the .each() also...
[05:40:04] <logikos> beings i am useing a .each in this case
[05:40:09] <decx> maybe you dont need each
[05:40:19] <logikos> hmmm
[05:40:58] <logikos> in this case I think i do because i'm also working with some data-attr 's on each element
[05:41:07] <logikos> to get some of the spinner options
[05:41:17] <logikos> if not for that i wouldnt
[05:41:20] <quarrier> hello, i'm using this code http://puu.sh/9vU87/f600551ba1.png to display a spinner everytime someone click on a link. what i want to do is to set the  body's opacity to 0.3 but i want to display the spinner with 1 as opacity. it's working but the spinner doesn't have 1 as opacity, how can I do it so ?
[05:41:23] <logikos> ty for the tip
[05:41:52] <decx> that spinner function should each already
[05:42:27] <logikos> quarrier: if an elements parent's opacity is less than 1, than even if you set the inner elements opacity to 1 it is still transparent because its parent is set to less than 1
[05:42:50] <logikos> so although the inner may be set to 1, because the parent is say .3 or whatever you can see though it
[05:43:01] <quarrier> so i can't do this this way
[05:43:11] <decx> show already sets an inline opacity: 1 already
[05:43:23] <decx> already already
[05:44:15] <logikos> quarrier: i see no point in setting the entire body opacity, what is behind it to look at?
[05:45:33] <quarrier> logikos: it's to set a spinner that shows that another page is loading
[05:45:41] <keyboSlice> quarrier: I did say you would be better off appending / displaying a translucent mask layer over the window, rather than altering the opacity of the entire body
[05:46:19] <quarrier> ye ye i see how i'll do, i'll just wrap all the elements into a div and put the opacity on this div then set the spinner ou of it
[05:46:21] <quarrier> out of*
[05:46:30] <quarrier> thanks for your answers ;p
[05:46:40] <logikos> quarrier: keyboSlice is right, if your just wanting to grey out the background of your wait icon or whatever
[05:47:00] <quarrier> oh. got your point
[05:47:07] <logikos> there is nothing behind <body> so to set the opacity of body makes no sence
[05:47:33] <logikos> what your looking for is more of a lightbox effect
[05:47:56] <quarrier> ye but i had no clue how to do so, being intermediate/beginner in css and jquery
[05:48:09] <logikos> so use an existing lightbox plugin ?
[05:48:20] <quarrier> in fact i just wanted to do something like this : http://www.ronikdesign.com/project/luxesource.html
[05:48:24] <quarrier> whenever you click on a link
[05:48:51] <quarrier> i tried some jquery code found on internet which uses ajax requests but i'm not really aware of how it works and stuff
[05:48:52] <logikos> basicly you just append 2 elements to body, a mask layer with position:absolute;top:0;bottom:0;left:0;right:0; and then your loading icon
[05:49:06] <logikos> the mask layer just creates a background for your loading icon over the entire window
[05:49:23] <quarrier> alright trying
[05:50:01] <logikos> that example does not use opacity, so you would only need 1 element appended to body for that
[05:50:04] <logikos> not even 2
[05:51:49] <logikos> infact if you use firebug you can see that they have a <div class="spinner-container"> appended to there body and you can see all the styles of it
[05:52:34] <quarrier> oh alright
[05:52:39] <quarrier> i thought it was some js code
[05:52:48] <quarrier> so didnt went further using firebug
[05:55:11] <quarrier> logikos: by the way, is that possible to set a duration for this ?
[05:55:30] <quarrier> delay() ?
[05:55:45] <DRSK> So um perhaps a stupid question, but I have a value that goes from 100 to 0 based on scrolling downwards. I am intentionally using this value to make stuff happen. Now I need the exact same value but reversed, as in 0-100 instead of 100-0. Can I reverse it somehow? My brain has melted I can't wrap my head around it ;p
[05:56:22] <decx> x= 1 to 100; y=100-x
[05:57:21] <DRSK> decx » right, for now it's textMovits that's moving from 100 to 0, or actually it's -textMovits but yeah. Now I need fadeMovits to correspond to textMovits but when textMovits is 20 that means fadeMovits is 80.. I think
[05:58:13] <DRSK> so when textMovits is 0 .. fade is 100! haha. Well, that's the result I'm trying to achieve but failing at. Any ideas?
[06:11:16] <quarrier> i ended up doing this to set a delay : http://puu.sh/9w0m9/546b02b777.png --- but it's not working, i assume my function showSpinner has not the right syntax
[06:11:58] <Cork> quarrier: never ever ever EVER pass a string to setTimeout
[06:12:15] <quarrier> Cork/ tried with / without quotes
[06:12:20] <quarrier> saw quotes on a site
[06:12:27] <Cork> remove the '' and the ()
[06:12:44] <quarrier> not working either
[06:13:00] <Cork> it should
[06:13:17] <Cork> is the showSpinner working if you call it directly?
[06:13:18] <quarrier> no problem in the showSpinner() ?
[06:13:43] <quarrier> it isnt
[06:13:59] <Cork> quarrier: you should prob move the css to the css file and set a class instead
[06:14:31] <quarrier> well it was working with the css in there, the thing is that i want to have a duration on it (it lasted like 500ms or something like this)
[06:14:48] <quarrier> i tried with delay(value) but it wasnt working either
[06:14:58] <Cork> uh
[06:15:08] <Cork> the only thing with animation there is the show call
[06:15:18] <Cork> the rest isn't animation functions
[06:15:41] <Cork> and would prob be simplest to implement with transition (css)
[06:16:33] <quarrier> ahm, i should put a transition on the mask too ? this sounds weird to me since it's only a white background
[06:17:11] <Cork> depends on what you want it to do
[06:19:26] <quarrier> Cork: http://puu.sh/9w0MY/186f7e6079.png i want to have the opac bg/pacman for a certain amount of tie
[06:19:29] <quarrier> time*
[06:19:36] <quarrier> these 2 appears when i click on a link
[06:19:52] <Cork> quarrier: screenshots won't help anyone
[06:20:56] <quarrier> meh :< ahm
[06:21:02] <quarrier> hold on a min pls
[06:24:08] <K-202> var xmlElement; $(xmlElement).text(); // new lines (line breaks) are preserved in all browsers except old IE versions
[06:24:52] <K-202> Any solution to keep line breaks (\n) when reading XML element's contents in IE?
[06:26:00] <quarrier> Cork: yeah sorry, so basically i want to display 2 divs that have the style display: none for a given amount of time
[06:26:19] <gnu_d> Hi, does anybody know why a FormData object cannot be found in a web worker ?
[06:26:21] <Cork> quarrier: you can't really do that
[06:26:41] <Cork> quarrier: display isn't an property you can animate
[06:27:58] <quarrier> Cork: this is why i was looking for a function in jquery that could set a timer :/ thought delay() would work but ain't, or I use it badly
[06:28:18] <Cork> quarrier: delay is for animations
[06:29:34] <quarrier> yeah ok
[06:29:36] <quarrier> got it
[06:34:02] <t432> hi, I have a js object called foo returned from the server.  Object foo holds a birch of fields including a list called boo. Javascript is interpreting this list as String console log prints the list as e.g. "[User List Id: 4, Name: Rob, Date: 2014-06-15T15:10:28.000+01:00, User List Id: 5, Name: Tim, Date: 2014-06-15T23:41:48.000+01:00]", how can get js to cast the to an array
[06:36:45] <t432> Let me try that againt. Server is returning an object, that holds a bunch of fields including a list called boo. Javascript is interpreting the list as String.  When I output the list in console, it prints out a String (including the brackets) e.g. "[User List Id: 4, Name: Rob, Date: 2014-06-15T15:10:28.000+01:00, User List Id: 5, Name: Tim, Date: 2014-06-15T23:41:48.000+01:00]", I guess I need to cast the String to an Array but now sure how?
[06:43:15] <NoiseEee> t432: can you not change what the server outputs? it sounds like an API with a terrible unusable format. i'm surprised a valid endpoint is returning something like that
[06:44:03] <NoiseEee> you're sure its not JSON?
[06:44:08] <t432> NoiseEee: Server is doing what it supposed to do, return an object.
[06:44:19] <t432> yes
[06:44:43] <NoiseEee> well hate to tell you the server is doing a terrible job
[06:44:50] <NoiseEee> of not sending in any format
[06:44:56] <NoiseEee> dunno what you can do
[06:45:26] <t432> the object is converted to String in the client side.
[06:45:29] <NoiseEee> t432: or paste the actual response to a pastebin
[06:46:58] <t432> Here is the list I am trying to convert to Array, right now it in String format - "[User List Id: 4, Name: Rob, Date: 2014-06-15T15:10:28.000+01:00, User List Id: 5, Name: Tim, Date: 2014-06-15T23:41:48.000+01:00]"
[06:48:15] <NoiseEee> i don't know how to tell you in any other way that that is unformatted garbage
[06:48:21] <NoiseEee> what kind of array would you even imagine?
[06:48:34] <NoiseEee> it looks like an object
[06:49:09] <NoiseEee> either thats not the real server response or i dunno where you're going, can you pastebin the actual server response?
[06:50:46] <t432> hang on.
[07:19:53] <alexandernst_> I'm trying to build jQuery 1.8.3. I git-cloned the repo and git checkout 1.8.3. Now I'm running "grunt", but nothing happens (dist folder is empty, no error messages, no output at all). What's wrong?
[07:26:11] <BulleTime> hi there guys, i use packery to create dynamic layouts. but something is not working as i need it, please see my example:
[07:26:42] <BulleTime> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rHuyv
[07:26:44] <Amnesia> question, I need to remove all classes from a matched object that starts with "ui-icon". How could I achive this?
[07:28:11] <BulleTime> ok so when resizing, everything goes fine, except when page width goes below 600px there's a gap.
[07:28:19] <BulleTime> anyone knows how i should fix that??
[07:29:28] <t432> nvm
[07:29:55] <t432> i think I have to convert it o json before passing it to client.
[07:33:54] <pessimism> what is a tried and tested way of implementing a lightbox for clicking a vimeo video? I can only find libs that seem to work on <a>, not <iframe>
[07:36:14] <decx> because that doesnt make sense, if i click on the iframe i want to video to start not to see some popup
[07:36:19] <decx> the video*
[07:42:32] <BulleTime> anyone knows about my question?
[07:53:19] <EminenceHC> I am using query to make an ajax call and populate a multiselect. It is currently working fine but I am trying to clear all of the values in the multiselect before running the ajax. What am I doing wrong? https://gist.github.com/EminenceHC/f7dc312801684858dd28
[07:53:29] <EminenceHC> jquery*
[07:54:31] <thebope> It might be a pain but you might have to remove and reinitialize another multiselect
[08:01:34] <EminenceHC> thebope: Why is that?
[08:01:54] <thebope> jusat because widgets are weird
[08:02:04] <EminenceHC> darn
[08:02:07] <thebope> Otherwise, inspect the elements
[08:02:14] <thebope> and see where the values are being stored in the html
[08:02:21] <thebope> and make sure you're replacing the values in the right place
[08:02:40] <thebope> When you initialize the widget its probably putting a span and some other stuff somewhere
[08:04:22] <EminenceHC> thebope: When clearing values for a multiselect I can use .val('') right? or .empty()?
[08:04:35] <thebope> EminenceHC, probably not
[08:05:02] <NoiseEee> .val('') should be fine.
[08:05:05] <NoiseEee> tias
[08:05:24] <thebope> hmm I'm not sure which widget it is
[08:05:33] <ashgotti> Hello all. I need a bit of help before I lose anymore hair
[08:05:54] <EminenceHC> thebope: http://loudev.com/#usage
[08:05:54] <AL13N_work> goddamnit, the browser on a smart tv is real crap
[08:06:10] <AL13N_work> anyone have information on what kind of features actually work on smart tvs?
[08:06:19] <EminenceHC> AL13N_work: Yes they all seem to be really shitty and slow.
[08:06:19] <thebope> It seems you're using the api with 'addOption', is there a removeOption?
[08:06:29] <AL13N_work> EminenceHC: i don't even mind slow
[08:06:39] <ashgotti> I have a small project, 5 pages, 1 front page, 4 sub-pages. I'm using jquery mobile. On the frontpage, I have a cookie being created to control a pop-up that shows for the fist time user. The problem is if a user navigates to one of hte sub pages and back to the front page, the cookie is not seen and the prompt is shown again.
[08:06:41] <AL13N_work> EminenceHC: just "working" is difficult enough
[08:06:52] <AL13N_work> is there some kind of link where one can see this stuff?
[08:07:02] <EminenceHC> thebope: I don't think so, not for clearing values. There is an option for clearing selected values though.
[08:07:02] <AL13N_work> what is supported where? and such?
[08:07:21] <thebope> EminenceHC, which one do you want? To clear selected or clear the values?
[08:07:30] <EminenceHC> thebope: Clear the values.
[08:07:49] <ashgotti> Here is the code and the popup. http://jsfiddle.net/afP8D/. The cookie works if the user refreshes but the native way that jquery navigates pages doesn't seem to re-run code.
[08:10:04] <ashgotti> any tips or ideas on JS placement with jquery projects?
[08:10:13] <ashgotti> or how to get it to run with each page navigation?
[08:10:42] <StanAccy> Is there a way to attach/invoke a function whenever an element is dynamically added to a page? I was looking at the .on() function, but this seems to work only with events (click etc).  Is there something that can be triggered if an element is added to the DOM (and would its performance suck)
[08:10:43] <ashgotti> I did try to attache checkCookie(); to the back button in my header and console shows it as firing but it doesn't seem to affect the popup
[08:16:58] <jessica582> i have a link on the top of a page that i want to move to another part of the page lower down, but want to select the lower part that should be jumped to by text content, not by id, how do ?
[08:19:28] <jphase> jessica582: you can use the :contains selector
[08:19:57] <jphase> $('div:contains("hi")')  would select a div with the word "hi" in it for example
[08:21:14] <jphase> StanAccy: you need to use something like:  $(document).on('click', '.childselector', function() { //stuff here });
[08:21:57] <jessica582> jphase, ok ty
[08:22:48] <StanAccy> jphase: Yeh, I see that works for events like onclick, but what about dom elements that are added dynamically - Im looking to invoke JS functions on newly inserted DOM elements
[08:23:38] <jphase> StanAccy: that works for DOM elements that are added dynamically. by binding to the entire document and passing a child selectore, dynamically added elements with the class of "childselector" in the example above take on those click events
[08:23:45] <decx> that's what it does though
[08:23:58] <shoky> not what he's asking for
[08:24:07] <jphase> oh, perhaps I'm misunderstanding
[08:24:25] <decx> the real question is, who isnt
[08:24:28] <shoky> he wants DOM mutation observers i guess
[08:24:36] <shoky> or, thinks he wants
[08:24:43] <jphase> ^
[08:24:45] <decx> come one come all, what is it going to be
[08:24:45] <jphase> hehe
[08:24:54] <decx> rien ne vas plus
[08:25:13] <shoky> c'est oui vous vous . . . .
[08:25:27] <jphase> *insert french laugh*
[08:25:32] <decx> my french knowledge stops at gambling words -.-
[08:25:37] <jphase> lol
[08:25:46] <shoky> yea i just made it up anyway ;D
[08:25:57] <decx> it's yes, we we?
[08:26:05] <shoky> maybe ;p
[08:26:13] <decx> that's what my 4 years of french in school were there for !
[08:26:19] <StanAccy> jphase: I undewrstand how it works for click (and similar events). Lets say I render a page.  And then thye user clicks a button, and I use JS to insert a new element.  I want to run a function using that newly inserted element
[08:26:37] <StanAccy> I want to attach other JS events/functions to that newly inserted element
[08:27:00] <StanAccy> shoky: After a quick google, thats exactly what Im after, but that doesnt seem to be a recmomended approach
[08:27:04] <shoky> StanAccy: run your functions when inserting the element
[08:27:12] <shoky> manually
[08:27:17] <StanAccy> ok, thanks
[08:27:25] <jphase> StanAccy: yeah, and the events can be bound before hand
[08:27:32] <decx> oh so like the create event
[08:27:36] <decx> in ui
[08:27:37] <jphase> I mean, I never really do much else tbh
[08:29:04] <jphase> StanAccy: I mean, if you absolutely want mutation events then there's several stackoverflow posts about how to use them:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7692730/dom-mutation-event-in-jquery-or-vanilla-javascript#answer-7749629
[08:29:26] <jphase> I personally just like to bind my events and call my functions when I insert the elements as shoky described
[08:29:43] <jphase> it's anywhere from 6-50 less lines of code :)
[08:31:14] <StanAccy> jphase: I didnt know what they were called - now I have the keyword, I have something to read up on.  Doesnt sound like its the preferred approacgh though
[08:32:28] <jphase> I mean, there's a use for them, just not very many real applications. 95% of things you need to do with dynamic elements can be done by binding events to the document with a child selector and calling whatever functions you need to call as you insert them.
[08:33:09] <jessica582> if i have a string #abc how do i remove the #
[08:33:15] <decx> fyi it's better to delegate from the closest parent
[08:33:26] <jphase> jessica582: .replace('#', '');  ?
[08:33:31] <decx> that or substring
[08:33:48] <jphase> ahh yes, what decx said on both
[08:33:55] <alistair> how permanent is deleting a disk image. Just say you delete the wrong one...
[08:33:58] <alistair> ?
[08:34:11] <jphase> alistair: what on earth does that have to do with jQuery? lol
[08:34:12] <jessica582> ok
[08:34:23] <alistair> oh shit, wrong channel
[08:34:25] <jphase> hehe
[08:34:34] <decx> get your pitchforks
[08:35:00] <alistair> homer-simpson-bush.gif
[08:35:18] <jphase> 404 - image not found
[08:37:19] <jessica582> jphase: decx: ended up doing $var.substring(1) to remove the # from #abc where $var = #abc
[08:38:46] <ashgotti> Has anyone used jquery cookies in a project yet?
[08:38:56] <ashgotti> I'm having trouble detecting the cookie unless the page is reloaded
[08:39:07] <ashgotti> jquery's built in page movements don't detect cookies
[08:39:23] <ashgotti> I have to load pages as "external" for it to see cookies
[08:39:35] <moewp> R13ose ah you are going to have to write a custom excerpt thing for that, i would look into getting the whole block of content, using the $_REQUEST global to get the query (or $_GET) and then parsing that block of text using that query text and trimming everything but 50 characters before and 50 characters after or whatever
[08:41:21] <davesleep> how do i validate groups of textfields using jquery.validate?
[08:42:38] <moewp> rose you have to excuse me im using a new irc client and i have no idea how to message on it lol
[08:45:44] <jessica582> would it be better to just assign an id to each of a certain element, at an extreme high there'd be about 20, or to select each one by class and text content if the goal is to select that element to do a page jump ?
[08:51:06] <decx> needs more context, i for one have no idea what constitutes a page jump
[08:51:17] <decx> and how that relates to selctors
[08:57:12] <jessica582> decx: when you click a link at the top of the page and it scrolls down to a different, related part of the page
[08:57:23] <jessica582> like the contents on wikipedia
[08:57:38] <decx> but why rely on js for a basic browser feature?
[08:58:55] <jessica582> decx: you're asking me why I want to have the link to another part of the same page ?
[08:59:08] <jphase> jessica582: decx is referring to the native functionality of anchor tags like href="#blah"
[08:59:32] <jphase> which would jump to <a name="blah">Blah section</a>
[08:59:47] <jphase> perhaps you're wanting to animate to the section?
[08:59:50] <decx> right, i for one hate js controlled animated slow scroll, hash to id/name is immidiate and good
[09:00:01] <decx> immediate?
[09:00:06] <jphase> ^
[09:00:11] <jessica582> oh lol, because I wanted to smooth scroll
[09:00:22] <jessica582> it isn't necessary though
[09:00:23] <duch_kazatel> ugh smooth scroll.
[09:00:34] <jessica582> okay fine you all win, no smooth scroll
[09:00:44] <decx> o/ high five everyone
[09:00:45] <jphase> jessica582: k, honestly you should still use native anchors to do that and not do :contains() or anything though
[09:00:46] <duch_kazatel> "hey i'd like to see this thing" "COOL WELP YOU'RE WAITING FOR MY ANIMTION FIRST."
[09:00:56] <jphase> hehe
[09:01:18] <jphase> I get it for one-page parallaxy sites and stuff, clients like it :\
[09:01:18] <jessica582> still, is assigning an id to each location okay if it's going to be, maybe 10 at most
[09:01:34] <jessica582> it is a one page site
[09:01:48] <duch_kazatel> jessica582 that's the entire idea.  the href points to the ID you want to scroll to.
[09:02:15] <jessica582> i'd be using jquery to assign the ids
[09:02:31] <duch_kazatel> why not make then yourself?
[09:02:46] <jessica582> because the number of them isn't fixed
[09:03:26] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't make sense.  why not generate the server-side?
[09:03:54] <jessica582> it makes sense
[09:04:18] <jessica582> it's a list of items the contents of which are gotten through an api
[09:04:24] <jessica582> but the items on that list change
[09:04:29] <duch_kazatel> ah, and you're getting them client-side.  gotcha.
[09:04:48] <jessica582> yessir : )
[09:10:26] <Ownix> I have a massive JSON string, approximately 89256 of these: {key:"DATA-DATA-DATA", value::"DATA DATA DATA"}. Is there an easy way I can let the user select this data?
[09:10:49] <duch_kazatel> Ownix by not presenting them with 90000 options.
[09:11:03] <Ownix> For example, if I put all that in a <select><option claue="DATA-DATA-DATA">DATA DATA DATA</option></select> it would crash the page
[09:11:12] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: I have no choice
[09:11:18] <duch_kazatel> is it possible to break that information down any further?
[09:11:22] <Ownix> They have to chose from data out of a specific table
[09:11:28] <Ownix> Its location codes
[09:11:43] <Ownix> Theres no telling if they will need a city in China, or a city in the USA
[09:12:01] <duch_kazatel> right - which is why you start out with a "select your country".
[09:12:09] <duch_kazatel> then "select your state/province/region/whatever"
[09:12:13] <duch_kazatel> then "select your city"
[09:12:29] <duch_kazatel> alternatively you can to a search box with autocomplete.
[09:12:33] <qdk> Ownix: perhaps switch to an autocomplete field instead.
[09:12:50] * qdk ^5 duch_kazatel 
[09:14:34] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: yeah thats what im doing elsewhere. I have bigger problems right now though:  Error during serialization or deserialization using the JSON JavaScriptSerializer. The length of the string exceeds the value set on the maxJsonLength property.
[09:15:00] <Ownix> Im going to have to do a country dropdown like you suggested, and then use jquery to call my API and grab all locations for that code
[09:15:15] <duch_kazatel> Ownix why not convert it to an actual object server-side, instead of trying to deserialize it client-side?
[09:15:20] <Ownix> Because there is too much effing data
[09:15:38] <duch_kazatel> either way, break that data down into smaller chunks. it's not useful as-is imo.
[09:15:41] <Ownix> Well either way I have to get it to the page
[09:15:54] <Ownix> I can serialize it as a JSON string and pass that string to my page
[09:16:21] <Ownix> er... technically its being de-serialized server side
[09:16:47] <Ownix> either way the system doesnt like a JSON string that big being sent out
[09:17:16] <duch_kazatel> then don't ship a string that big ;) break it down into smaller objects and you should be fine.
[09:18:22] <ashgotti> Hello, does anyone have any tips for using the back button in a jquery mobile project? I have a cookie created on the landing page that isn't seen when the user navigates away and comes back to it. It is seen if the page is refreshed though. Is the back button bring up a cached version of the site?
[09:41:05] <RabSimpson> hi folks, i'm trying to install masonry using the jquery method. i followed the instructions on the masonry site, but it isn't changing the layout. any ideas? here's my url: http://www.outlawink.co.uk/responsive/work.php (this is just a layout, the images aren't final, just there for testing)
[09:41:36] <ashgotti> Can anyone take a look at http://lemonlimedesigns.ca/tohr/kiosk and see why the cookie for the dialog is not detected if the user navigates to one of the subpages and back to the front page using the back button?
[09:42:16] <duch_kazatel> RabSimpson put your masonry init in a jquery document.ready.
[09:42:37] <duch_kazatel> RabSimpson you're trying to init on a container that doesn't yest exist.
[09:42:47] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: i tried that before but i'll do it again. just a sec.
[09:42:50] <Es0teric> hi everybody quick question
[09:42:58] <jParkton> Es0teric: no!
[09:43:01] <Es0teric> is it possible to grab json thats already being output
[09:43:07] <Es0teric> from a different url
[09:43:11] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:43:12] <jParkton> wut?
[09:43:34] <Es0teric> yeah ok this is what i am trying to do, theres already a form sending POST data to a url that outputs JSON, i want to grab that output
[09:43:42] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: i must've been a bit more drunk than i imagined when i tried it the first time :P
[09:43:46] <jParkton> $.getJSON(url, function(data) {}); // Win!
[09:43:53] <Es0teric> jParkton: its not that easy
[09:43:56] <jParkton> ok
[09:44:14] <jParkton> maybe some code would help this hypothetical, psychic conundrum?
[09:44:23] <Es0teric> jParkton: my problem is that the form data being sent is from a modal that contains radio buttons that pass in an ID into the url to get the json output
[09:44:25] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric use .done() and pass the data around...
[09:44:38] <jParkton> ^
[09:44:44] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: this ajax call is not under my control… its made when the button is pressed
[09:44:48] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric how are you submitting the data?
[09:44:54] <Es0teric> if i had that control, i would have already solved this
[09:44:58] <jParkton> lol
[09:45:06] <duch_kazatel> how are you submitting the form?  via .ajax()?
[09:45:08] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: its a button press.. not submit
[09:45:28] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: yes, but since its wordpress the .ajax() cannot be seen
[09:45:36] <Es0teric> its functions wordpress does to handle that for the user which sucks
[09:46:12] <jParkton> #Wordpress
[09:46:14] <Es0teric> i just want the json that is being returned
[09:46:17] <Es0teric> jParkton: already went there
[09:46:33] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric so it's using $.ajax() in the background.  easy-peasy - either remove that binding and be smart, or use a global ajax event handler: http://api.jquery.com/ajaxSuccess/
[09:46:45] <duch_kazatel> that second method is The Wrong Way(tm) but should work.
[09:46:59] <jParkton> lol
[09:49:00] <duch_kazatel> what plguin is being used for this modal, btw?\
[09:49:10] <duch_kazatel> you should be able to hook into that instead.
[09:49:18] <duch_kazatel> or whatever is driving the AJAX.
[09:49:25] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: see this is the problem when the modal pops up… i target the button id that submits the form but nothing
[09:49:36] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:49:38] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: no plugin, its the native wp modal
[09:50:10] <duch_kazatel> "native wp modal" - then it's probably a plugin ;) there should be support for callbacks in there.
[09:53:03] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: while masonry is now loading, it's giving me difficulty with imagesLoaded. they're all appearing stacked on top of each other in a vertical column and imagesLoaded (copied directly from http://masonry.desandro.com/appendix.html) is throwing me an error.
[09:53:15] <duch_kazatel> RabSimpson huh?  link again?
[09:54:12] <silverdust> I get the following on my log
[09:54:37] <silverdust> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'replace' of undefined  jquery-2.1.1.min.js:2
[09:54:56] <duch_kazatel> silverdust usually means you're calling .replace() on something that isn't a jquery object.
[09:54:58] <silverdust> I think this is preventing some things from working fine
[09:56:00] <silverdust> duch_kazatel: I just searched my local script and I have no occurence of .replace()
[09:56:19] <duch_kazatel> or, rather, that .replace() is being called on something that isn't defined.
[09:56:24] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ silverdust

[09:58:17] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: sorry, someone was bleating in my ear for a minute there. here it is: http://www.outlawink.co.uk/responsive/work.php
[09:58:24] <silverdust> duch_kazatel: ^
[09:58:38] <duch_kazatel> silverdust looking.
[09:59:46] <decx> an emblem style logo for a tattoo parlor without mirrored tattoo machine siluettes? you're totally breaking the design clichee law here
[10:01:03] <Ownix> I have a for...in loop for this data: {EN:english, DA:German, .... } my for loop does for (variable in data). How is variable == EN and data[variable] == english?
[10:01:28] <Ownix> Is variable automatically the key in the key/value?
[10:02:16] <RabSimpson> ownix: it looks like EN is your key, with english as your value
[10:02:26] <Ownix>  data[variable] make sense because I learned you can access a value from a keyvalue pair with data[key]
[10:03:14] <Ownix> RabSimpson: so its for(key in keyvaluepair)?
[10:03:30] <duch_kazatel> Ownix yep.
[10:03:44] <duch_kazatel> Ownix the for (property in object) technically.
[10:04:33] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: but property doesnt tell me that its the key
[10:04:44] <Ownix> which is why I was confused when trying to understand the documentation on MDN
[10:05:02] <duch_kazatel> sure it does - in javascript, there is no "key".
[10:05:08] <Es0teric> how do i unbind a ajax call?
[10:05:19] <duch_kazatel> there are objects with properties.
[10:05:28] <silverdust> duch_kazatel: couldn't find problems right?
[10:05:48] <duch_kazatel> silverdust got side tracked.  if you're going to imply it's a problem with jquery, you're likely wrong.
[10:06:41] <silverdust> I didn't get that. imply what? what's wrong?
[10:06:41] <cereal> can i do $(this).filter('td') or similar inside of a selectors each argument?
[10:07:45] <duch_kazatel> silverdust what is imagesLoaded?
[10:08:32] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: that was my problem :P
[10:09:09] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: imagesLoaded checks when the images within the container are all loaded in order to re-lay out the masonry element
[10:09:13] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: http://masonry.desandro.com/appendix.html
[10:09:15] <duch_kazatel> silverdust $carousel.css(classObject); that's your issue
[10:10:02] <duch_kazatel> RabSimpson i'm sorry, are you asking a question?
[10:10:15] <duch_kazatel> >.>
[10:10:34] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: yep, i did, further up, concerning imagesLoaded. you asked me for my url again (http://www.outlawink.co.uk/responsive/work.php)
[10:10:53] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: i can see you're dealing with a few different things though
[10:11:00] <silverdust> duch_kazatel: imagesLoaded is a jquery plugin I'm using
[10:11:27] <RabSimpson> silverdust: are you working with masonry? that's where i'm running into problems with it
[10:11:30] <duch_kazatel> RabSimpson looks like you're running something againg browser resize - that soiund familiar?
[10:11:42] <duch_kazatel> silverdust did you see the thing I pasted?
[10:11:55] <duch_kazatel> your problem was that particular line.
[10:12:00] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: nothing to do with browser resize, not yet anyway (i have to make this responsive after i get it working)
[10:12:14] <duch_kazatel> RabSimpson it fixes if you resize the window, that's why i ask.
[10:12:18] <silverdust> no
[10:12:43] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: that's weird. i wonder why it isn't working with the loaded window size.
[10:12:43] <duch_kazatel> silverdust the error goes away if I remove that line.  if that's not solving anything, then please update your fiddle so it works :)
[10:13:01] <silverdust> You haven't pasted any links to me
[10:13:27] <duch_kazatel> silverdust i pasted a line of code to you.
[10:13:38] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: my console is still throwing an error with imagesLoaded though: TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating '$container.imagesLoaded')
[10:13:38] <silverdust> ok yea I saw that
[10:14:28] <chinoto> Are all handlers attached to dom ready ($(func) and $(document).read(func)) run together and block the browser, or are they run separately?
[10:14:29] <duch_kazatel> RabSimpson link to the page again?
[10:14:36] <RabSimpson> http://www.outlawink.co.uk/responsive/work.php
[10:15:46] <duch_kazatel> rab because jQuery( '#masonry' ) and jQuery( '#masonry' ).masonry(); dont
[10:15:50] <duch_kazatel> *don't return the same thing.
[10:16:13] <duch_kazatel> $container = jQuery( '#masonry' ); $container.masonry(); $container.imagesLoaded();
[10:16:19] <duch_kazatel> need to do those all separately.
[10:16:50] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: i'm probably misreading this then: http://masonry.desandro.com/appendix.html
[10:17:00] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: check out the fourth code block
[10:18:11] <duch_kazatel> try what i showed you.
[10:18:41] <chinoto> The reason I ask is that I have some things that I want to off load until the dom ready, so that other things can show up, but I'm not sure if they'll all run together in one clump or allow other processing in between each handler.
[10:19:41] <duch_kazatel> chinoto iirc it's a first-in, first-out ordeal for each handler
[10:20:06] <chinoto> I knew that bit, but it doesn't quite answer the question.
[10:20:27] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: i'm not sure if i'm following what you suggested properly, could you have a quick glance again? http://www.outlawink.co.uk/responsive/work.php
[10:20:52] <duch_kazatel> RabSimpson also, you have a trailing comma in that object you're passing to imagesLoaded.
[10:21:14] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[10:21:22] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: removed the comma, nothing changed
[10:21:35] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: danke :)
[10:22:02] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/C9Tbs/ try something like thios.
[10:23:15] <chinoto> Meh, it's not like this is a problem as it is, it's going to be even less of a problem at dom ready.
[10:23:24] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: tried it, still getting this: TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating '$container.imagesLoaded')
[10:23:50] <duch_kazatel> RabSimpson do you understand what that error might mean?
[10:24:14] <chinoto> And if I really care, I can always stick it inside of a setTimeout instead of dom ready.
[10:24:40] <duch_kazatel> chinoto it's hard to understand what exactly your problem is without a use case.
[10:25:30] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: it says to me that the plugin imagesLoaded (which the masonry site said was included in the masonry package) either isn't working or isn't there at all
[10:25:49] <chinoto> There isn't really a problem at the moment, I just want to know if setting up multiple handlers for an event would cause a continuous block or if there would be a gap between each handler.
[10:26:17] <duch_kazatel> they would fire one right after the other iirc.
[10:26:39] <chinoto> So continuous blocking?
[10:26:47] <Es0teric> ok
[10:26:54] <duch_kazatel> it doesn't block the page if your code isn't blocking.
[10:26:58] <Es0teric> how do i add something after a div?
[10:27:10] <Es0teric> i mean after an element… like h1
[10:27:34] <duch_kazatel> divs are elements too ;)
[10:28:37] <Two_Behind> I have a hidden div inside my main div and when I click on the plus symbol I want to show it;  having issues with $(this) referencing the expand div tag
[10:28:42] <Two_Behind> see http://pastebin.com/217UfN64
[10:29:13] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: well what i am saying is i have a <div id=“”someID”> <h1></h1><div class=“something”></div></div>
[10:29:21] <Es0teric> i want to append after the h1 in someID
[10:29:32] <Es0teric> not in the h1, just after it
[10:29:45] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric http://api.jquery.com/insertafter/
[10:29:46] <chinoto> duch_kazatel: Here's a simple example, would anything be able to happen between each console.log()? $.each([1,2,3,4,5],function(k,v) {$(function() {console.log(v);});});
[10:30:10] <duch_kazatel> RabSimpson imagesLoaded is not included as apart of masonry, btw.
[10:30:14] <duch_kazatel> not sure whewre you got that idea.
[10:30:42] <duch_kazatel> chinoto i'm not sure... probably not? but i can't be 100% certain.
[10:31:20] <chinoto> duch_kazatel: Ok, then I will just have to seek out the answer, or go with setTimeout.
[10:31:32] <chinoto> or not worry about it :D
[10:31:35] <duch_kazatel> chinoto don't use settimeout btw.
[10:31:48] <chinoto> why -_-
[10:31:55] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: thats not working… i am trying to do a chain of append() after an h1
[10:32:07] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Es0teric
[10:32:07] <b-ot> Es0teric: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:32:32] <duch_kazatel> chinoto if your code relies on it, that means you likely have other problems.  if you're worried about guaranteeing order of execution, that's not hard to do.  FIFO principle.
[10:33:22] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: not sure where i read that, got it now and loaded :)
[10:33:25] <chinoto> It's not about order of execution, it's about giving the browser time to do stuff between chunks of code.
[10:33:41] <duch_kazatel> chinoto are you running ajax?
[10:33:49] <duch_kazatel> or are you worried about the browser locking up?
[10:34:11] <chinoto> duch_kazatel: Haven't you ever been to a page where it just locks up for a long time?
[10:34:17] <duch_kazatel> chinoto rarely.
[10:34:27] <duch_kazatel> you will not cause that unless you're doing something pretty extreme.
[10:34:37] <duch_kazatel> that's why a use case is pretty vital here ;l)
[10:34:49] <chinoto> I'm not at the moment, but I am curious.
[10:35:07] <chinoto> I did have this thing before that was pretty taxing.
[10:35:26] <chinoto> Though I might not have been doing it very efficiently.
[10:35:31] <duch_kazatel> chinoto http://www.feedthebot.com/pagespeed/render-blocking.html
[10:35:43] <duch_kazatel> i think you're worried about JS that blocks rendering.
[10:36:19] <Two_Behind> anybody have a chance to look at my show div tag issue
[10:36:32] <chinoto> duch_kazatel: I get it already, I'm was just wondering if you knew if multiple dom ready handlers would do that, you don't so that's ok.
[10:36:39] <Two_Behind> http://pastebin.com/217UfN64
[10:36:58] <duch_kazatel> chinoto the act of binding the hanndler does not cause that, nbo.
[10:36:59] <duch_kazatel> *no
[10:37:04] <duch_kazatel> what the handler DOES is another story.
[10:37:27] <chinoto> duch_kazatel: Please stop...
[10:37:33] <duch_kazatel> whatev broseph.
[10:40:01] <duch_kazatel> Two_Behind http://jsfiddle.net/ev3LK/
[10:40:24] <duch_kazatel> the img was a child of the anchor - i'd bind to the anchor instead of the img.
[10:40:33] <str8uplinux> trying to find a way to make a filter that works with a string that contains both numbers and letters. Right now I am using two different filters, but i need one that works with both: http://pastie.org/9295703
[10:41:11] <Es0teric> i dont want it to remove the element
[10:41:43] <str8uplinux> any ideas on how to accomplish this?
[10:41:44] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric did you setup a fiddle?
[10:41:46] <Two_Behind> @duch_kazatel Excellent that worked;  any way to click the same image and have it close
[10:42:13] <chinoto> Es0teric: Do a fiddle, I wanna see.
[10:42:29] <chinoto> or a bin
[10:42:54] <duch_kazatel> Two_Behind http://jsfiddle.net/ev3LK/1/
[10:43:57] <duch_kazatel> str8uplinux something about your code isn't "clicking" for me - what happens when you try your startsWith against a number?
[10:44:13] <Two_Behind> @duch_kazatel Simple and to the point.  Thanks
[10:44:18] <duch_kazatel> Two_Behind yep.
[10:44:49] <duch_kazatel> aaah i get it.
[10:51:27] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric http://jsfiddle.net/w44mU/
[10:51:28] <duch_kazatel> btw
[10:54:56] <Two_Behind> @duch_kazatel curious to this situation....  Only the first div will show when you click on the plus symbol The others do nothing.  http://xfitculpeper.net/getstarted.php
[10:55:16] <duch_kazatel> Two_Behind what plus symbol?
[10:55:26] <duch_kazatel> oh.
[10:55:35] <chinoto> Two_Behind: fix the css
[10:55:56] <duch_kazatel> also: only one thing can have an id on that page.
[10:56:07] <duch_kazatel> *only one thing can have a specific ID.
[10:56:13] <duch_kazatel> #add can only exist once.
[10:56:16] <duch_kazatel> chang ethat to a class.
[10:56:32] <Two_Behind> @duch_kazatel let me try that....
[10:57:08] <duch_kazatel> Two_Behind btw drop the @ symbol - my client notifies me when you type in my name, but the @ trips that up ;)
[10:57:58] <Two_Behind> duch_kazatel: gotcha on the @.  Changed the id to a class and it now works
[10:58:03] <duch_kazatel> cool.
[10:58:05] <chinoto> Two_Behind: Most people use a "," or ":" after the name.
[10:58:21] <duch_kazatel> welcome to irc :D
[10:58:33] <Two_Behind> chinoto: Thanks I'm still learning the irc channels.
[10:59:15] <chinoto> I just type a little of people's names and then press tab, if it's at the beginning of a line, it also adds the colon.
[11:00:20] <chinoto> I should switch to hexchat some time...
[11:19:32] <pragma-> @chinoto I prefer weechat and screen/tmux -- after a bit of customization to make it look more like irssi #leet #oldschool #textrules
[11:24:39] <pragma-> http://i.imgur.com/6WVmpyh.png
[11:26:18] <Daghdha> I combined float and draggable. Because i want a dib that scrolls with the page, static to the viewport. But i also want to drag that to another position. It is sorta working now with goolg. But IE is being a ##$@#
[11:26:19] <chinoto> I prefer this. I'm currently using xchat, which is basically unmaintained, hexchat however, is maintained.
[11:26:34] <Daghdha> SO i wondered, is there any readymade draggable things to make it scroll in the viewport?
[11:32:14] <duch_kazatel> chinoto you get an answer to your question?  i'd love to hear any findings you've got if so.
[11:33:19] <chinoto> I have an idea for how to get my answer. It's all in how you frame the question :D
[11:33:31] <duch_kazatel> apparently.
[11:55:52] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: i got it working exactly as i wanted, including being responsive :D - http://www.outlawink.co.uk/responsive/work.php
[11:56:55] <duch_kazatel> very cool.  now put the JS you've put on page in a JS file instead.
[12:00:09] <dhardison> trying to load some binary data via ajax -- gettings an error in chrome: Failed to read the 'responseText' property from 'XMLHttpRequest': The value is only accessible if the object's 'responseType' is '' or 'text' (was 'blob')
[12:00:11] <dhardison> any ideas?
[12:00:22] <Daghdha> js jquery.floatobject default jquery?
[12:00:40] <duch_kazatel> Daghdha nope.
[12:00:46] * Daghdha removes..
[12:01:34] <dhardison> i think it's a line typeof xhr.responseText is throwing the error
[12:02:00] <Daghdha> Anyone know of a bug with draggable where you draw a div down real vast and let mous ego that div is now outside the viewport?
[12:02:19] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: yup, that's the plan. i'm collecting all the js for this theme and having it load via a single php file to cut down on http requests.
[12:02:35] <duch_kazatel> "a single php file" wut
[12:03:01] <duch_kazatel> dhardison the responsetype header needs to be empty or text, not blob.
[12:03:03] <duch_kazatel> that's my guess.
[12:03:17] <RabSimpson> i'm having php grab all of the separate js files i'm loading and pushing them out on a single url
[12:03:25] <RabSimpson> myjs.php for example
[12:03:28] <dhardison> duch_kazatel: but then i can't use html Blob class to build the blob
[12:03:34] <duch_kazatel> RabSimpson don't do that :(
[12:03:36] <dhardison> this seems like a jquery bug
[12:03:48] <duch_kazatel> RabSimpson concat them as a javascript file.
[12:04:05] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: not sure how to do that
[12:04:30] <RabSimpson> duch_kazatel: will it cut the number of requests down?
[12:04:43] <duch_kazatel> it can.
[12:04:58] <duch_kazatel> dhardison this seems like a server issue to me.
[12:05:17] <dhardison> how so.
[12:05:22] <dhardison> i can curl the file fine?
[12:05:22] <RabSimpson> i'd rather avoid cutting and pasting all of the different tools i've acquired (masonry for example) into a single file
[12:05:48] <duch_kazatel> RabSimpson linking those separately should be fine.
[12:05:57] <duch_kazatel> dhardison right - that's not AJAX...
[12:06:07] <duch_kazatel> #jquery-dev is the place to go if you think it's a bug with jquery.
[12:06:21] <duch_kazatel> but it looks like the responsetype is wrong for what you're trying to do.
[12:06:21] <dhardison> duch_kazatel: k, thanks
[12:06:34] <dhardison> well, i'm pulling an image back in binary over ajax
[12:06:50] <dhardison> and then i want to dump it into a Blob() using a typed array
[12:07:01] <dhardison> however, that line in jquery is causing the browser to throw an exception
[12:07:31] <duch_kazatel> that error looks to me like it's from the underlying xmlhttprequest
[12:07:35] <duch_kazatel> but i could be wron.g
[12:08:03] <BillCriswell> RabSimpson: If you do <script src="all.php"></script> just remmber to do <?php header("Content-type: application/javascript"); at the start of your script. There are build tools you can use to do that for youa bit easier though ( after you learn the build tools ).
[12:08:08] <duch_kazatel> he's gone.
[12:08:25] <BillCriswell> Ah.
[12:09:09] <jimi_> I am trying to get all elements with data attribute foo equal to bar, im trying $(':data(foo==bar)') but not getting results. Can someone give me a hand
[12:09:41] <duch_kazatel> data attributes, or things you set with .data()?
[12:09:52] <duch_kazatel> there's an actual difference.
[12:11:18] <yeukhon> do jquery developers still think http://domenic.me/2012/10/14/youre-missing-the-point-of-promises/  recommendation to feed jquery's promise to Q a good idea? specially, i read somewhere a while ago the thing that current jquery is missing is error handling?
[12:11:26] <islalobo> Good afternoon, I am trying to use .toggle. Anyone know why this isn't working for me? http://jsfiddle.net/zjaJT/23/
[12:11:51] <duch_kazatel> yeukhon you mean people using jquery, or the building building jquery itself?
[12:11:54] * Daghdha has stopped making errors to work around that.
[12:12:02] <yeukhon> duch_kazatel:  i supposed both :)
[12:12:07] <yeukhon> as user, im
[12:12:26] <duch_kazatel> islalobo you're missing the closing end of your code ;)
[12:12:40] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/zjaJT/26/
[12:12:57] <islalobo> duch_kazatel: the " } "
[12:13:08] <islalobo> I just added it and it still doesn't want to work
[12:13:08] <duch_kazatel> islalobo and a closing );
[12:13:12] <duch_kazatel> you need });
[12:13:23] <islalobo> duch_kazatel++
[12:15:11] <duch_kazatel> yeukhon jquery promises are kind of broken and kind of miss the point
[12:16:00] <yeukhon> duch_kazatel:  yeah i was about http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11010  from some article
[12:16:17] <yeukhon> which brings me to the question if feeding into Q is what jquery users do or not
[12:17:44] <islalobo> duch_kazatel: now if only it would work on my site.
[12:17:53] <duch_kazatel> islalobo are you getting any console errors
[12:18:14] <duch_kazatel> yeukhon i don't work with promises very much in my day-to-day
[12:18:16] <islalobo> I checked on firebug and the script is there and no flags.
[12:18:29] <duch_kazatel> islalobo is your js before your html?
[12:19:07] <islalobo> duch_kazatel: it is in the head. referencing a script in another folder. we're using drupal.
[12:19:24] <duch_kazatel> islalobo slap a document ready around it.
[12:20:50] <yeukhon> duch_kazatel:   thats cool :)
[12:21:09] <islalobo> duch_kazatel: I have jQuery(document).ready(function() { } around the script
[12:21:14] <yeukhon> not a big deal for me as i just started converting callback hell to promises
[12:21:28] <yeukhon> whther it's q or jquery-based. just curuous on this subject.
[12:21:33] <duch_kazatel> islalobo can you share your site?
[12:22:33] <duch_kazatel> islalobo it should look like this: http://jsfiddle.net/zjaJT/27/
[12:23:44] <jParkton> duch if I am needing user input for a function is it better to design some type of form to get those values needed? I assume doing three alert() is going to be annoying
[12:24:05] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[12:24:10] <duch_kazatel> don't alert() if you can avoid it.
[12:24:50] <jParkton> ok
[12:25:59] <jParkton> in the .html() can I do something like html('<li>' + value + '</li>')?
[12:26:05] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[12:26:06] <islalobo> duch_kazatel: it's working, more or less. When I click they all expand.
[12:26:35] <chinoto> jParkton: And also useless, now if it was prompt()
[12:26:36] <duch_kazatel> and you only want the related one to expand i assume?
[12:26:38] <jParkton> does html take those strings and make an elm or do I need to do the createelement thing
[12:26:39] <Jattenalle> jParkton, yes
[12:26:56] <jParkton> k
[12:26:59] <Jattenalle> it'll work
[12:27:02] <duch_kazatel> yeah it creates magic for you automatically.
[12:27:06] <chinoto> jParkton: Better to do $('<li/>',{text:value});
[12:27:23] <Jattenalle> $(selector).html('anything') = will parse html tags and whatnot you put in
[12:27:26] <duch_kazatel> arguably more readable that way, yeah.
[12:27:31] <chinoto> jParkton: Avoiding XSS is a good thing.
[12:27:34] <jParkton> chinoto: and it automagically will create that elm?
[12:27:45] <Jattenalle> if you want the actual dom thing, you want $('the html here').whatever();
[12:27:55] <chinoto> jParkton: aye, but you'll need to append it somewhere.
[12:27:55] <jParkton> Jattenalle: ok good! :)
[12:27:58] <islalobo> duch_kazatel: yeah, the one that is clicked on
[12:28:03] <jParkton> ah
[12:28:19] <jParkton> well good, the more I need to do the more I learn
[12:28:21] <jParkton> lol
[12:28:26] <duch_kazatel> islalobo can you update the tfiddle to be more indicative of what you've got thenf?
[12:28:28] <duch_kazatel> *then
[12:28:30] <Jattenalle> and as chinoto pointed out, if you are inserting values that are passed by the user
[12:28:35] <Jattenalle> you better sanitize that
[12:28:41] <jParkton> yeah
[12:28:49] <jParkton> I dont know why I am doing it this way
[12:28:52] <Jattenalle> dont assume people have used a sane Username
[12:28:55] <Jattenalle> sanitize that shit! :D
[12:29:12] <duch_kazatel> always always always.  and if it goes to a server, sanitize again.
[12:29:13] <chinoto> and escape regardless of sanitization, just as a precaution.
[12:29:34] <micrypt> Any chance someone might know why a deep clone isn't copying the behaviour on this plugin? https://github.com/montrezorro/bootstrap-checkbox
[12:29:40] <chinoto> Unless you really really know what you're doing and even then it's a good idea.
[12:29:48] <jParkton> https://github.com/jparktonDesigns/Projects/tree/master/Classes
[12:30:02] <jParkton> im trying to do the inventory one
[12:30:03] <duch_kazatel> micrypt you whatnow?
[12:30:32] <chinoto> Also, it's better to validate if possible and just bitch at the user, than to accept bad data.
[12:31:13] <duch_kazatel> but don't rely on just client-side validation.  always back it up with server-side.
[12:31:19] <micrypt> duch_kazatel: ...clone(true, true); skips copying across behaviour.
[12:31:46] <duch_kazatel> micrypt you mean you're trying to clone an entire plugin?
[12:31:49] <duch_kazatel> why?
[12:31:59] <chinoto> I generally don't even bother with client side, I just have it report what the server told it was wrong.
[12:32:03] <micrypt> duch_kazatel: No.
[12:33:03] <jParkton> but i think i am overthinking how to accomplish it
[12:33:35] <islalobo> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/zjaJT/32/ (I was trying to add 'this' to it as well)
[12:33:41] <Daghdha> Does it mean parameter has to be a selector when it says: var makeUnselectable = function ($target)
[12:34:14] <duch_kazatel> islalobo that markup is funky.
[12:34:30] <duch_kazatel> why not put <div class="item"> around each "group"?
[12:35:02] <islalobo> duch_kazatel:  the html? it is generated from the drupal view
[12:35:42] <duch_kazatel> can you change the view?
[12:36:14] <kedgen> Can anyone point me to some resources on how to load one image at a time via ajax? Essentially I have a batch of images that is fairly large. Displaying them all at once is very slow. Can I load each individually and if so how?
[12:36:35] <chinoto> islalobo: Please indent better >.<
[12:36:35] <duch_kazatel> islalobo http://jsfiddle.net/zjaJT/33/ - if you can change the markup, this is what I'd do.
[12:36:54] <islalobo> chinoto: sorry!
[12:37:14] <duch_kazatel> islalobo otherwise, you're going to have to do all kinds of weird magic to git this working the way you want.
[12:37:27] <chinoto> and make the groups more obvious with some blank lines at least.
[12:37:49] <chinoto> Formatted: http://jsfiddle.net/zjaJT/34/
[12:38:28] <chinoto> err, do 33, nvm
[12:38:32] <duch_kazatel> or do what I did and add divs around each group ;)
[12:38:56] <Amnesia> question, does one of you folks know how to be able to select weeks with jquery's datepicker?
[12:38:59] <chinoto> duch_kazatel: Didn't see your fiddle, though I did see your mention of the idea.
[12:39:16] <duch_kazatel> chinoto - http://jsfiddle.net/zjaJT/33/
[12:39:43] <chinoto> I did afterward though "err, do 33, nvm"
[12:39:44] <duch_kazatel> oh hah i see what you're saying.
[12:39:44] <duch_kazatel> derp.
[12:40:03] <kedgen> anyone know of a way to load one image at a time via ajax when there are a large number of images to load? Load times are fairly high and if I could load images as they are available, it would help me greatly. Thanks!
[12:40:33] <mouses> i need to talk about paypal. whats a good offtopic channel?
[12:41:01] <duch_kazatel> kedgen pushy pushy ;) you need a queue!  deferred objects might be useful here, too.
[12:41:03] <chinoto> kedgen: I think the way to do it is to use a dummy attribute and then when the image is in view, set src to the dummy attribute.
[12:41:26] <duch_kazatel> kedgen can you show some sample code?
[12:42:14] <kedgen> Ah, my apologies! thank you! I actually don't have code yet, I have the existing code that loads all of the images as a batch into a javascript template, but I haven't yet attempted the one image at a time approach
[12:42:33] <duch_kazatel> what's the ajax part about then?
[12:42:33] <kedgen> would that be helpful? (The code that loads all images at once)
[12:43:17] <chinoto> kedgen: I haven't a clue what you're talking about, I know about css sprite sheets though.
[12:44:08] <kedgen> chinoto: basically fetching images via ajax, loading each as it is available in the location where it will ultimately reside in the dom. I'd like to have an image loader in place of the yet-to-be-loaded image
[12:44:27] <duch_kazatel> are you fetching the image source?
[12:44:32] <duch_kazatel> or the actual image data?>
[12:44:42] <kedgen> duch_kazatel: the src
[12:44:56] <duch_kazatel> check out the load event and setting up a queue.
[12:45:17] <kedgen> duch_kazatel: thank you! I will commence googling :)
[12:45:22] <duch_kazatel> $parent.on('load', 'img', function(){ /* fetch next image */ });
[12:45:30] <duch_kazatel> event delegation will be helpful here, too.
[12:46:04] <chinoto> Is this so images are forced to load sequentially?
[12:46:50] <duch_kazatel> you could replace the ajax part in there with an array of image sources so you don't have to hit that api.
[12:46:59] <duch_kazatel> and get the next image src.
[12:47:03] <duch_kazatel> etc.  anyway, lunch
[12:47:33] <chinoto> and I'm gonna turn off my blinker.
[12:48:10] <jParkton> nooooo
[12:49:48] <islalobo> duch_lunch++
[12:49:50] <islalobo> works!
[12:53:09] <Amnesia> could anyone over here tell me what happened to the "selectWeek" option of the datepicker widget?
[13:01:47] <dhardison> so is it true that i cannot use responseType blob for jquery.ajax?
[13:03:06] <dhardison> i will have to use xmlhttprequest
[13:09:52] <systemfault> If you can use blobs… you don’t really need $.ajax
[13:11:19] <crosbow> (firefox) i have a jquery plugin (fitvids) which works in its demo page, but fails on my blog.. i get error Error: Permission denied to access property 'toString' without info where it happened! when i then call the same command which is in $(document).ready() it suddenly works??
[13:12:17] <duch_lunch> crosbow that usually means the plugin tries to access something that doesn't yet exist, and does so in a way that's unforgiving
[13:12:29] <crosbow> how can i delay the plugin?
[13:12:37] <crosbow> its in the footer and the last one listed there..
[13:12:38] <duch_lunch> use the document ready.
[13:12:57] <crosbow> jQuery(document).ready(function() { plugin-call } is what i do
[13:13:24] <duch_lunch> is your page valid?  are you running this against any ajax'd content?
[13:13:36] <duch_lunch> what if you switch to $(window).load()?
[13:13:46] <crosbow> well its a plugin that makes videos scale perfectly
[13:14:45] <crosbow> same error but it works??
[13:14:51] <duch_lunch> huh?
[13:15:01] <crosbow> in chrome it worked btw anyways
[13:15:12] <crosbow> maybe the error comes from something different
[13:15:30] <duch_lunch> did you try removing the plugin and seeing if the error persists?
[13:15:43] <crosbow> no :D
[13:16:15] <crosbow> yup still there
[13:16:34] <duch_lunch> i'd have to see the page then.
[13:17:02] <crosbow> no dont worry. aslong as it works idc ;) its a Wordpress theme that loads thousands of other stuffs
[13:17:21] <duch_lunch> that's not good.
[13:19:17] <crosbow> duch_lunch: yes i should throw out everything that is not needed.. but aint nobody got time for that.. thanks for your help!
[13:19:28] <duch_lunch> :(
[13:22:06] <abailarri> Hello. I'm trying to integrate plupload on my web but I see this error: TypeError: $(...).plupload is not a function. Anyone know for what reason can be?
[13:22:16] <abailarri> I have in other web the same code and works
[13:23:38] <systemfault> abailarri: Forgot to load the .js file?
[13:23:45] <abailarri> systemfault, no
[13:23:50] <FlashSlayer> I tried to reproduce IE 8 bug that replaces \n into spaces but accidentally it works properly http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/68585495/IE8whitespaces.html
[13:25:03] <abailarri> systemfault, solved
[13:25:05] <duch_lunch> FlashSlayer fyi windows newlines are different than OSX newlines - maybe that's part of your problem?
[13:25:11] <systemfault> abailarri: Awesome :)
[13:25:48] <BillCriswell> guys
[13:25:56] <duch_lunch> :)
[13:26:07] <jParkton> ohai BillCriswell
[13:26:14] <BillCriswell> Ayyyyy
[13:26:25] <jParkton> how are ya
[13:26:43] <BillCriswell> I'm good. You?
[13:26:59] <jParkton> feel like im making some progress so cant complain
[13:27:01] <jParkton> :)
[13:27:06] <FlashSlayer> I tried to convert to unix newlines and no difference. This problem occurs in Sharepoint app. I must investigate it more.
[13:27:29] <duch_lunch> FlashSlayer right - use windows newlines.
[13:27:36] <duch_lunch> OSX newlines are the same as unix ;)
[13:27:48] <BillCriswell> jParkton: That's nice. I need to do that but I'm feeling super unwilling to reattempt this approach.
[13:28:12] <daivyk> #swift-lang
[13:28:33] <jParkton> lol
[13:28:47] <daivyk> ops.. sorry!
[13:28:49] <BillCriswell> What's the verdict on swift so far?
[13:28:50] <jParkton> if you are not learning you are stagnating
[13:28:59] <jParkton> its kinda like racket?
[13:29:01] <jParkton> lol
[13:29:15] <duch_kazatel> inb4 "need 5 years experience with swift"
[13:29:40] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yeah, that joke was beat to death 5 minutes after it was announced.
[13:29:48] <duch_kazatel> i know :(
[13:30:13] <daivyk> i don't know, I am going to start reading about it... hehehe!!
[13:30:29] <systemfault> The most you can get would be 4 years of swift experience… if you get the Apple guys who created it.
[13:31:03] <BillCriswell> I wonder how many people voluntarily up and leave Apple.
[13:31:08] <BillCriswell> I bet more than I think.
[13:31:35] <Daghdha> i have 2 integers in javascriopt, indexStart and indexStop. I have dives named id="mydiv1" id="mydiv2" etc. Is it possible to make a selector that selects all of those within the range  indexStart and indexStop?
[13:32:14] <duch_kazatel> you could use a startswith selector and enumerate over those.  that might be how i'd do it.
[13:36:15] <BillCriswell> $('div').filter(function() { var n = +this.id.slice(4); return this.id.slice(0, 4) === 'mydiv' && n >= min && n <= max; }); could work
[13:36:51] <BillCriswell> var n = +this.id.slice(5) ***
[13:37:04] <BillCriswell> I just can't count.
[13:37:19] <BillCriswell> Switch 4 with 5 throughout haha
[13:37:34] <__joshua___> $('div').slice(indexStart, indexStop)?
[13:38:09] <BillCriswell> __joshua___: He needs to do something based on the number at the end of the id.
[13:38:10] <__joshua___> oh, the names
[13:38:13] <__joshua___> right
[13:38:33] <Cork> Daghdha: your prob better of not basing it of the id
[13:38:36] <__joshua___> are they sparse?  if not sort then slice
[13:38:42] <Cork> dom selectors isn't built for it
[13:39:13] <Cork> your best option is to set a class on the elements to group select them
[13:39:32] <Cork> and then just use a straight slice
[13:40:13] <Cork> your second best is to build a selector string and select the elements based on that
[13:41:47] <Daghdha> i just made a for loop
[13:42:27] <BillCriswell> $((new Array(max - min).map(function(n,i){ return '#mydiv' + i; }).join(','))
[13:42:28] <BillCriswell> WEEE
[13:42:37] <BillCriswell> Oh, that didn't work.
[13:43:19] <Cork> BillCriswell: $.map should
[13:43:30] <ashgotti> Hello all. Quick question. Does anyone know how to turn off the hiding of titlebars/footers when clicking the body of a page as seen here: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.2/toolbar-fixed/
[13:44:23] <Cork> Daghdha: when you're selecting a range of elements of elements based on ids you are misusing the structure dom is meant to use
[13:44:34] <Daghdha> Yes, looks to complex to me.
[13:44:42] <Cork> Daghdha: ids are meant to identify a specific element and classes is to grab a group
[13:45:00] <Cork> $('.my-divs').slice(start, end)
[13:45:07] <Cork> should do the job you want
[13:45:38] <BillCriswell> Yeah, if the elements are in order that's definitely the way to go haha
[13:45:52] <Daghdha> indeed.
[13:47:26] <BillCriswell> var min = 10, max = 25, selector = $.map(new Array(max+1 - min), function (e, i) { return '#mydiv' + min++; }).join(','); worked
[13:47:27] <BillCriswell> ewwww
[13:48:28] <Cork> $($.map(new Array(max-min), function(u,i) { return '#mydiv' + min+i; }).join(','))
[13:48:30] <Cork> should work
[13:48:45] <Cork> opps
[13:48:50] <Cork> $($.map(new Array(max-min), function(u,i) { return '#mydiv' + (min+i); }).join(','))
[13:48:50] <BillCriswell> Where id you get that gross idea?
[13:49:50] <Cork> BillCriswell: a reduced version of your first try :)
[13:50:30] <Cork> i'm trying to figure out a shorter form
[13:50:34] <Cork> but... failing
[13:50:50] <BillCriswell> I see you too like to waste your time.
[13:51:23] <Cork> hmm
[13:52:31] <Cork> $('#mydiv' + Object.keys((new Array(max-min)).join(',#mydiv'))
[13:52:35] <Cork> a little better at least
[13:52:51] <BillCriswell> new Array() always confuses me
[13:53:27] <Cork> js> var min=4, max=10; print('#mydiv' + Object.keys((new Array(max-min)).join(',#mydiv'));
[13:53:32] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[13:53:41] <BillCriswell> Hm, Object.keys(new Array(10)); returns []
[13:54:42] <Cork> right...
[13:54:53] <Cork> cause the array drops keys for undefined
[13:54:53] <scottalan> I cannot for the life of me get the width set on this: https://gist.github.com/scottalan/2087bca8b9126a6aac80 What am I doing wrong?
[13:54:55] <Cork> forgot that
[13:55:22] <scottalan> I'm debugging and watching it and "this.width" doesn't change
[13:55:32] <Cork> scottalan: try using $(this).width();
[13:55:46] <Cork> (meaning use css not attributes)
[14:02:04] <BillCriswell> Evening folks.
[14:02:26] <scottalan> Cork: You're awesome!! thanks
[14:15:19] <NIndustries> Hi, can anyone see why my buttons on jQueryUI are not following the parent's width? http://www.d00med.net/cordova/
[14:16:36] <blindMoe> NIndustries: because you have padding on them and box-sizing is set to content-box and not border-box ?
[14:18:08] <Jisan> looking for geust posters for my web development blog
[14:21:40] <NIndustries> ahh, Ill check that. thanks blindMoe
[14:22:43] <NIndustries> You're right!
[14:23:40] <NIndustries> Thanks man :) I still have to find out why my box corners arent being shown correctly
[14:28:26] <jenia> hello
[14:29:09] <jenia> i'm using jquery mobile and i have some weird thing happening: I leave an <a href="/account/login/ rel="external">Google</a>
[14:29:10] <FlashSlayer> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/68585495/DUPA.html this is good example - test in IE 8 and other browsers
[14:29:29] <FlashSlayer> IE 8 replaces \n into spaces when accessing text()
[14:29:46] <jenia> when i press that i'm redirected to some weird page saying "Continue"; that "continue" is in a list kind of. when i press it nothing happens
[14:30:54] <arschmitz> jenia: are you trying to make /account/login/ load not with ajax?
[14:31:04] <arschmitz> like have it do a full reload?
[14:31:56] <jenia> no just a redirect i this
[14:31:59] <jenia> yes
[14:32:09] <jenia> think*
[14:32:28] <jenia> arschmitz, @
[14:32:41] <arschmitz> jenia: redirect? you never mentioned a redirect only clicking a link?
[14:33:18] <duch_kazatel> i'll bet they're confused what "redirect" means.
[14:33:38] <arschmitz> duch_kazatel: probably
[14:34:07] <jenia> the way it works for me is that I have python_social_auth working on /login/google/, it redirects you to google authentication page
[14:34:19] <arschmitz> jenia: anyway our issue is you need data-rel not just rel if i understand you correctly
[14:34:30] <arschmitz> your issue*
[14:34:57] <jenia> okay let me try.
[14:35:26] <arschmitz> data-rel="external" is meant to load an external page not part of your jqm app its the same thing as doing data-ajax="false" basicly just a little different semanticly
[14:35:27] <jenia> this is what I have: 		<li><a id="google-login" href="/login/google/" data-rel="external">Google</a></li>
[14:35:38] <jenia> didn't work.
[14:35:55] <arschmitz> jenia: oh sorry i misread your google threw me off thats same domain
[14:36:06] <jenia> yea
[14:36:10] <arschmitz> jenia: you want data-ajax="false" to do full reload on same domain
[14:36:23] <jenia> thanks arschmitz
[14:36:29] <jenia> tell me please what is:
[14:36:45] <jenia> getView() function?
[14:36:59] <arschmitz> jenia: ???
[14:37:23] <jenia> Let us assume that you are binding your listview to a custom adapter. In that case, the following piece of code goes into your getView call:
[14:37:25] <antiPoP> Hi, I was looking at http://codebrief.com/2012/01/the-top-10-javascript-mvc-frameworks-reviewed for choosing a framework. Is that list complete or should i choose any other?
[14:37:32] <jenia> i got that from stack overflow
[14:37:54] <arschmitz> jenia: i have no idea what your talking about with getView thats not part of jquery mobile
[14:38:05] <jenia> okay. thanks
[14:38:22] <antiPoP> Should I review any other, I meant.
[14:38:40] <jenia> i just have one last question. if i were not to reload the page, where would i leave a callback for that link?
[14:39:13] <arschmitz> what do you mean a callback for that link like you want a handler when its clicked?
[14:39:34] <jenia> i set data-ajax=false.
[14:40:02] <jenia> so is there some ajax executed automatically when the link is pressed?
[14:40:16] <arschmitz> jenia: in jquery mobile all pages are loaded via ajax
[14:40:40] <arschmitz> jenia: thats how you get transitions and why it can work in webviews and things like that
[14:40:56] <jenia> ohh okay. yea i see what u mean. thanks a lot arschmitz
[14:41:04] <arschmitz> jenia: no problem
[14:47:25] <jessica582> is there something about selecting an id from an anchor tag that's different than with other tags?
[14:48:20] <__joshua___> nope
[14:48:51] <__joshua___> jessica582: whats happening?
[14:48:57] <jessica582> i can select the element properly because .text() on it works, but then $(this).attr('id') returns undefined
[14:49:22] <__joshua___> and what element is this?
[14:49:38] <jessica582> it's a link
[14:49:53] <__joshua___> are you sure its the actual anchor?
[14:50:18] <jessica582> Yes because .text() shows the text that it should.
[14:50:28] <__joshua___> text will show all the child elements too
[14:50:35] <__joshua___> so maybe
[14:50:45] <__joshua___> this is a span wrapping the anchor or something
[14:51:27] <jessica582> well i'm doing $('.board > h2 > a') jorgev
[14:51:35] <jessica582> i mean __joshua___
[14:52:09] <__joshua___>  $('.board > h2 > a').each(function(){ console.log($(this).attr('id'); }); ?
[14:52:24] <jessica582> outputs undefined __joshua___
[14:52:44] <__joshua___> can you paste your html in a pastebin or something?
[14:52:50] <Lingo> hi, is there a way to preload images and only display them when they are complete loaded?
[14:53:03] <jessica582> __joshua___: sure. one sec
[14:53:24] <__joshua___> yeah Lingo.  one sec
[14:55:46] <__joshua___> example: var img = new Image.  $(img).attr('src', 'x.png').load(function(){ $(img).appendTo('body'); });
[14:55:56] <__joshua___> er, new Image();
[14:55:57] <jessica582> __joshua___: http://hastebin.com/uhavobomij.xml
[14:56:24] <__joshua___> ids can't start with number?
[14:56:37] <jessica582> __joshua___: the real one doesn't
[14:56:40] <duch_kazatel> not in pre html5
[14:57:18] <Lingo> thank u __joshua__
[14:58:24] <Cork> duch_kazatel: and not post either
[14:58:33] <duch_kazatel> Cork hrm?
[14:58:52] <Cork> duch_kazatel: ids starting with a number doesn't work in modern html either
[14:59:02] <__joshua___> jessica582: that all works for me
[14:59:24] <__joshua___> Cork:  works for me
[14:59:47] <Cork> __joshua___: it works in some areas, but not all
[15:00:41] <Cork> duch_kazatel, __joshua___: http://jsfiddle.net/CbTyK/
[15:00:53] <jessica582> __joshua___: hmmm okay i guess i'll do some more digging. Ty
[15:00:57] <__joshua___> right, not in css
[15:02:21] <jessica582> __joshua___: i suspect that the ids aren't defined at the time that the function that does this is running
[15:02:39] <__joshua___> ah
[15:03:23] <jessica582> awww yisss that was it! __joshua___
[15:09:18] <gandalfx> heyoh
[15:09:21] <gandalfx> I got a question
[15:09:53] <gandalfx> Is there a (simple) way to select the closest common ancestor of a set of elements (i.e. one jquery object)
[15:10:18] <gandalfx> something like $('.multiple-elements').commonAncestor()
[15:28:57] <__joshua___> intereseting
[15:29:47] <__joshua___> just using jquery?
[15:50:33] <antlong_> does anyone know of a good plugin for implementing search on accordian contents?
[15:54:11] <__joshua___> antlong_: you mean you want to search the text in an accordian widget?
[15:54:52] <antlong_> __joshua___ filter on text, and look inside the accordions for the search string
[15:56:50] <__joshua___> $('.ui-accordion-content"contains("search_string")') ?
[15:57:00] <__joshua___> $('.ui-accordion-content:contains("search_string")')
[15:57:14] <antlong_> __joshua___ i don't know how to implement this at all
[15:57:48] <__joshua___> i would help me, but your request is still very vague
[15:57:54] <__joshua___> i would help you*
[16:01:06] <antlong_> __joshua___ www.multiverseminer.com, please click crafting in the right panel
[16:01:19] <antlong_> __joshua___ I would like a search input, when you type in it, we only return matches in the accordion contents
[16:03:48] <bradmaxs> Having trouble with a json response.  If I alert(data), I get the correct response.  If I alert(data.msg), it says undefined? Any suggestions?  http://jsfiddle.net/j5yQ9/
[16:05:17] <shoky> bradmaxs: don't use alert for debugging, use console.log.  that way you'll probably see that response is a string, not an object
[16:06:16] <shoky> bradmaxs: and if that's the case, either serve it with a JSON content-type, use dataType: 'json', or JSON.parse(response)
[16:07:01] <bradmaxs> shoky: thanks.  I'll give these a go. Appreciate the fast response.
[16:09:34] <__joshua___> the gist is $('input.craft_filter').on('keyup', function(){ var value = $(this).value();  var content = $('.crafting_accordian > .ui-accordion-content); content.not(':contains('"+value+'")').hide();  content(':contains('"+value+'")').show(); });  not quite right, but close
[16:10:03] <__joshua___> also, antlong_ don't disable right click while development, its very frustrating
[16:10:21] <antlong_> __joshua___ sorry. we need right click to equip things.
[16:10:34] <__joshua___> hmmmm
[16:10:52] <antlong_> __joshua___ i need to find out how to make a context menu come up when you click on the items.
[16:11:01] <__joshua___> well you should allow it to propagate if you hold shift or something.  (only during development)
[16:15:04] <__joshua___> are a few of those sprites from terraria?
[16:15:17] <BulleTime> guys, man, i have been searching for hours for a solution for my problem
[16:15:21] <bradmaxs> shoky: content-type worked! Thanks again.
[16:15:25] <BulleTime> please see this code:
[16:15:26] <BulleTime> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rHuyv
[16:15:38] <BulleTime> how can i fill the gaps?
[16:17:47] <__joshua___> haha
[16:18:07] <shoky> BulleTime: uhh max-width: 600px  instead of 599px ...?
[16:18:07] <__joshua___> well, get rid of your borders, and make the max width 600, not 599
[16:18:14] <shoky> ;p
[16:18:27] <__joshua___> :)
[16:18:35] <BulleTime> lol yeah because of some fixes
[16:18:42] <BulleTime> but
[16:18:48] <BulleTime> size it up
[16:19:13] <BulleTime> on 600 the blocks should go 1 > 3 > 2
[16:19:28] <BulleTime> it should fill:S
[16:19:40] <BulleTime> please shoky help :)
[16:19:42] <shoky> what?
[16:19:56] <shoky> with max-width:600px  there's no gaps
[16:20:14] <BulleTime> yeah i mean i posted it to soon
[16:20:24] <BulleTime> i know of the 599 lolz
[16:21:06] <BulleTime> but i mean
[16:21:07] <duch_kazatel> see the code guys
[16:21:45] <BulleTime> the masonry aint doing that much its job, i cant get a single 4 column view at work
[16:22:11] <duch_kazatel> you want a 4 column view?
[16:22:21] <__joshua___> antlong_: are a few of those sprites from terraria?  they seem really familiar
[16:22:40] <antlong_> __joshua___ some from OGA, but only like 4 or 5
[16:22:50] <__joshua___> oga?
[16:22:57] <antlong_> open game art
[16:24:06] <decx> i cant rightclick? cmon
[16:24:41] <__joshua___> ah cool
[16:25:17] <BulleTime> shoky u know the jquery packery or masonry stuff?
[16:26:23] <zack_> how we need to do in this?
[16:26:27] <shoky> BulleTime not really
[16:26:53] <BulleTime> shoky oh ok np
[16:30:19] <BulleTime> shoky so on the example 600px is ok, 599 not
[16:43:13] <Yahkob> My application adds a string to a option menu in a <select>
[16:43:37] <Yahkob> is there anyway to focus on that string in the menu when i add it?
[16:45:46] <antlong_> __joshua___ how would i do the menu on click, like this? http://www.openorpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/charactertest.gif
[16:46:36] <jphase> Yahkob: yeah, you just use .prop('selected', true) when you add it
[16:48:14] <__joshua___> listen for right click events on each 'context'.  add and absolutely position a element at those coords.  i seem to recall that some browsers might have difficulty getting the xy coords correct for right click, but i wouldn't worry about that
[17:57:34] <jaccob> anyone used https://github.com/homerocavazos/jqv? It doesn't seem to work on ie8
[18:01:34] <duch_kazatel> let me take a look.
[18:02:21] <duch_kazatel> that's a really small lib.
[18:04:31] <jaccob> duch_kazatel, thx? you are talking to me right?
[18:05:38] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[18:05:46] <duch_kazatel> doesn't seem terribly popular either.
[18:06:09] <__joshua___> and those regex make me uneasy
[18:06:48] <duch_kazatel> either pick a different one or write your own.
[18:06:50] <jaccob> duch_kazatel, ahhh, I noticed. I have it already setup. At the bottom of the plugin, there is a if(errors){ block. Can I access the event there to add event.preventDefault(). return false seems to work on Chrome and FF, but not IE
[18:07:31] <duch_kazatel> you're going to wind up with compromises all around at that point.
[18:07:34] <duch_kazatel> ditch it and write your own.
[18:07:39] <duch_kazatel> or pick another plugin.
[18:09:11] <jaccob> duch_kazatel, hmm, well I will try to find a spot to pop in an event.preventDefault() in there. I don't know about compromises, lol.
[18:09:35] <duch_kazatel> you're looking to edit the plugin itself.
[18:09:37] <duch_kazatel> that's a bad idea/.
[18:09:56] <jaccob> how can you console.log an object?
[18:10:05] <__joshua___> console.log(object);
[18:10:09] <jaccob> I have do for(key in object)
[18:10:19] <__joshua___> or easy mode:
[18:10:28] <jaccob> __joshua___, its not working, I just see [object HTMLFormElement]
[18:10:30] <__joshua___> console.log(JSON.stringify(object));
[18:10:36] <jaccob> __joshua___, thx
[18:10:41] <duch_kazatel> D:
[18:10:45] <duch_kazatel> this is going to be painful to watch,.
[18:11:00] <jaccob> duch_kazatel, c'mon dude, if you can't help...
[18:11:26] <jaccob> I wonder if JSON.stringify is available even
[18:11:28] <duch_kazatel> i tried mano.
[18:12:15] <jaccob> duch_kazatel, did you look at the plugin source code? do you have the skills?
[18:12:19] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[18:12:25] <duch_kazatel> insulting me isn't going to help you here.
[18:12:55] <jaccob> duch_kazatel, dude, help someone else, thx anyways
[18:13:12] <duch_kazatel> it's validation - very simple thing to want to do.  use another plugin - that's the right thing to do here.
[18:13:19] <duch_kazatel> you'll spend less time on it that way.
[18:13:34] <jaccob> duch_kazatel, ok, thx for you help.
[18:13:56] <duch_kazatel> lmao whatever mano.
[18:14:03] <__joshua___> duch is right, but........ by not working in ie8, what do you mean?
[18:14:19] <buddyq> Hi guys, I’m working with supersized library and I’m trying to see if I can toggle thumbnails automatically. They don’t have an option for them but they are triggered by an arrow. I’m wondering how programmatically I can trigger this action from a variable.
[18:14:22] <jaccob> __joshua___, sure, doesn't mean I must do that.
[18:14:38] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ buddyq
[18:14:38] <b-ot> buddyq: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:14:44] <buddyq> Here is a pastebin snippet of the toggle: http://pastebin.com/EnUqXqz7
[18:14:51] <jaccob> __joshua___, it submits the form. on errors I have return false, so it doesn't submit the form, but in IE8, return false doesn't work.
[18:15:20] <duch_kazatel> jaccob you're acting offended - i'm sorry if I offended you, that's not the intention.  i'm simply trying to help point you in a more effective direction.  that's all.
[18:15:31] <duch_kazatel> buddyq can you seting a functioning version in a fiddle?
[18:15:32] <buddyq> this is what I am trying to no avail: if($(api.options.thumb_links)) $(vars.tray_button).toggle();
[18:15:45] <buddyq> duch_kazatel: functioning?
[18:15:48] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[18:15:52] <duch_kazatel> as in working.
[18:16:03] <buddyq> Hmm… there’s a lot of things involved…images, etc.
[18:16:14] <duch_kazatel> even a small use-case?
[18:16:18] <__joshua___> jaccob: so its submitting page?  are you getting a js error (in that second before reload)
[18:16:25] <buddyq> its very popular plugin
[18:16:34] <buddyq> I figured a lot of you would be familiar with it.
[18:17:04] <duch_kazatel> buddyq probably not, but you're trying to toggle something programmatically - what does ($(api.options.thumb_links) return?
[18:17:09] <buddyq> but this question is more general I would suspect. How can I fire a toggle command as if it were clicked via a variable.
[18:17:09] <jaccob> __joshua___, hmm, I didn't go that route, I was trying to find where in the script I can see my event object
[18:17:17] <duch_kazatel> oh automatically, not programmatically.
[18:17:25] <duch_kazatel> you can't "watch" variables.
[18:17:27] <jaccob> __joshua___, does ie8 even have decent console
[18:17:28] <duch_kazatel> you have to fire on an event.
[18:17:29] <__joshua___> jaccob: shouldn't like 236 be return $this.each(function(){,  not return this...
[18:17:32] <buddyq> it returns successfully the variable thumb_links which in my case is 1
[18:17:34] <buddyq> = true
[18:17:36] <duch_kazatel> yeah IE8 does have a decent console.
[18:18:06] <duch_kazatel> buddyq you'll need to bind to the click event on the arrows, or see if there's a callback you can use.
[18:18:26] <jaccob> __joshua___, thx
[18:18:40] <__joshua___> well its just a guess from skimming code
[18:18:58] <buddyq> so should I look for what callbacks are available in the documentation?
[18:19:24] <duch_kazatel> buddyq probably.  if not there, you'll be looking into binding your own listener.
[18:21:20] <buddyq> duch, I use this single library instance as a central template for many sites. Each site has its own params so they can have different settings. One site might choose to have thumbnails when loaded, and another might want to hide them on load. So it needs to read the variable which is the “thumb_links” variable and then toggle it accordingly.
[18:21:52] <duch_kazatel> buddyq ok?
[18:22:34] <buddyq> there is no list of callbacks that I can find for supersized.
[18:22:36] <duch_kazatel> you'll need to expose that option somehow.
[18:23:23] <duch_kazatel> http://buildinternet.com/project/supersized/docs.html#thumb_links this is the option, right?
[18:23:39] <duch_kazatel> so you want to set it up so the site can change just that var and it'll work otherwise?
[18:25:29] <duch_kazatel> aaaah i get it.  there's something you can click that you can't set an option for.
[18:25:38] <duch_kazatel> but depending on the state of an option, you basically want to click it.
[18:25:40] <buddyq> yea. I already have the var setting correctly with whatever my client sets his site with.
[18:26:14] <duch_kazatel> you can always trigger a click event.
[18:26:31] <buddyq> For example, right now I have ‘thumb_links’ set to 1. And if set to 1, I want to automatically show the thumbnails. But the only way to show the thumbnails is to click the arrow in the bottom right.
[18:26:44] <buddyq> duch_kazatel: yes, this is what I am asking. How do I trigger a click event?
[18:26:52] <duch_kazatel> .trigger('click')
[18:27:18] <duch_kazatel> is this the thumbnail navigation, btw?
[18:27:23] <buddyq> okay, how exactly do I use that?
[18:27:33] <buddyq> not exactly. They are a little different.
[18:27:41] <buddyq> for example, Let me give you their demo page...
[18:27:45] <duch_kazatel> $('#theArrow').trigger('click');
[18:27:53] <buddyq> http://buildinternet.com/project/supersized/demo.html
[18:27:58] <duch_kazatel> where #theArrow is the selector if the thing you want to click.
[18:28:03] <buddyq> see that arrow in the bottom right? Click it and you will see.
[18:28:13] <duch_kazatel> for which demo?
[18:28:33] <duch_kazatel> ah that okay.
[18:28:39] <buddyq> go here: http://buildinternet.com/project/supersized/slideshow/3.2/demo.html
[18:28:44] <duch_kazatel> yep looking now.
[18:29:12] <duch_kazatel> $('#tray-button').trigger('click');
[18:30:47] <duch_kazatel> that make sense?
[18:31:36] <duch_kazatel> it might be smarter if you roll a new theme that copies everything, but adds this click to the _init() call.  maybe.  i gotta dash.  enjoy
[18:33:26] <buddyq> thanks
[18:35:35] <NitroLiq> Has anyone come across any accordion demos where its onclick also controls outside elements like a video slider?
[18:36:09] <jaccob> how can I tell if an object is of type event?
[18:40:59] <__joshua___> really strange that you wouldn't know, but...
[18:41:44] <__joshua___> if jq, then x instanceof jQuery.Event
[18:41:58] <jaccob> __joshua___, I just had to pop in an e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation(); and its good to go.
[18:42:08] <jaccob> I'm not sure if the second one was need but I added it
[18:42:19] <__joshua___> hmmm, return false should do have done that for you
[18:42:26] <__joshua___> what version of jq?
[18:42:50] <jaccob> __joshua___, yeah, return false is even better cause it stops bubling. But IE8 does work it properly.
[18:43:06] <jaccob> __joshua___, v2.1.2
[18:43:14] <__joshua___> ah
[18:43:48] <jaccob> __joshua___, there's a newer version, they fixed it? I didn't see any pull requests or issues on the github page.
[18:43:50] <__joshua___> 2.x doesn't support ie 8?
[18:44:26] <__joshua___> http://blog.jquery.com/2013/04/18/jquery-2-0-released/
[18:44:44] <__joshua___> you got run latest 1.x version
[18:50:32] <jaccob> __joshua___, oh no way, thx
[18:51:14] <jaccob> __joshua___, dude, thats jqv v2.1.2, jquery isn't that version, I run 1.10 version of jquery
[18:51:37] <__joshua___> oh
[18:54:06] <jaccob> __joshua___, so hows it going, what are you working on these days?
[18:54:59] <jaccob> friggin Duch_kavatel or whatever was sending me up the creek, or on scavenger hunt, or I don't know whats the best expression, but making me do a lot of work instead of a little.
[18:55:06] <__joshua___> very very weird then.  because return false is hte same as stopProgapation() (bubbling) and preventDefault should stop the submit
[18:55:13] <__joshua___> heh
[18:55:25] <__joshua___> im working on optimizing some mapping software
[18:55:32] <jaccob> __joshua___, yeah, but if you google it says return false doesn't work in ie8
[18:55:47] <__joshua___> show me
[18:56:40] <__joshua___> everyone on SOF is saying it should work
[18:56:45] <jaccob> Google "ie8 prevent form submit return false"
[18:56:56] <jaccob> what is SOF?
[18:58:08] <__joshua___> stackoverflow
[18:58:51] <__joshua___> now look at all the answers on the first page of google
[18:58:58] <jaccob> dunno, not based on todays experience. I had return false, and it wasn't working in IE8
[18:59:16] <__joshua___> ie "The real culprit was IE8 & console.log"
[18:59:29] <__joshua___> you probably errored before the return false
[18:59:47] <jaccob> They saying something about e.returnValue but e.preventDefault() worked for me.
[19:00:18] <__joshua___> im pretty sure you are erroring before you are returning false..... e.preventDefault() at the beginning would mask htis
[19:00:59] <antlong_> __joshua___ hi, i alerted you in the other room. someone said not to use a context menu for the equip, etc, menu when you click on an item. is there a better way?
[19:01:18] <jaccob> what do you mean erroring, if return false in ie8 works then it should work.
[19:01:49] <__joshua___> antlong_: well, it is normally considered poor form to have a right click menu in a web browser.  but then again this is a game......
[19:02:09] <antlong_> __joshua___ what about left click?
[19:02:27] <jaccob> of course left click
[19:02:31] <jaccob> lol
[19:02:57] <antlong_> well, what do i need to look up?
[19:03:03] <antlong_> i dont know how to implement this :)
[19:03:05] <antlong_> http://www.openorpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/charactertest.gif
[19:03:13] <__joshua___> jaccob: between lines 247 and 297 there are many opportunities for an exception to be thrown.  if that is the case, the return value is undefined, and the form will submit (erroneously)
[19:03:50] <__joshua___> antlong_: dude, that almost certainly a right click context menu
[19:03:57] <antlong_> __joshua___ yeah?
[19:04:22] <__joshua___> not sure what else it could be.... a key + left click combo would be confusing probably
[19:04:44] <__joshua___> oh wtf am i talking about
[19:04:54] <__joshua___> its a normal left click menu,  sorry
[19:05:19] <__joshua___> mouse down and move for dragging, click for context menu
[19:06:33] <antlong_> __joshua___ should i look for a plugin for this?
[19:08:10] <__joshua___> might pay do have a quick look.  but they are easy to make (the trick is getting the mouseout to kill the dialog, i usually cheat my making them modals)
[20:38:09] <aracodex123> hey guys, I bought a landing page template off themeforest, but its not playing nice with meteor framework (duh) ... is there any good practices for this? or I just gotta dig my way through the code and make it work?
[20:38:45] <aracodex123> sorry... wrong channel pls ignore, unless someone actually knows
[20:45:03] <antlong_> I need to open a dialog, and pass a value to it, which then gets used by html, how do i do that?
[21:04:12] <shoky> antlong_: assuming you're talking about jqui dialog. you can edit the dialog's content in the DOM directly
[21:04:39] <shoky> "which then gets used by html" sounds funny (and wrong)
[21:04:57] <antlong_> indeed :)
[21:04:59] <antlong_> working on it now, thanks
[22:16:09] <bashusr> hi - does anyone know how i can inspect a FormData object?
[22:19:29] <antlong_> bashusr you should be able to open dev tools or firebug, and type the name of the object in, and click on it
[22:19:50] <bashusr> antlong_, well, you can't...
[22:20:10] <bashusr> antlong_, i found the answer anyways
[22:20:10] <bashusr> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17066875/how-to-inspect-formdata
[22:20:17] <bashusr> and related http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7752188/formdata-appendkey-value-is-not-working
[22:20:34] <bashusr> it's a black hole object... you can only check the contents after you send the data
[22:20:55] <antlong_> hmn, if you fill the form you should be able to get the values
[22:21:00] <antlong_> before sending it
[22:21:01] <quazimodo> hey all
[22:21:15] <quazimodo> is there a general solution for click events on disabled input items?
[22:21:44] <quazimodo> I want to 'enable' the input if it's clicked on, these fields have default values that rarely change, the user usually just keeps whacking TAB and fillind numbers in quickly
[22:24:39] <bashusr> antlong_, you try, i'm not filling a form
[22:24:46] <bashusr> i'm populating a FormData object
[22:25:13] <bashusr> in console, do test = new FormData(); test.append('foo', 'bar');
[22:25:34] <bashusr> and then try reading anything out of the 'test' object
[22:25:47] <bashusr> if you can get a key listing or bar out, i'll be very happy :)
[22:26:14] <antlong_> bashusr link me your form
[22:26:19] <bashusr> antlong_, there is no form!
[22:27:00] <bashusr> antlong_, i'm making a formdata object - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[22:27:04] <antlong_> oh
[22:27:17] <bashusr> yeah.
[22:27:22] <antlong_> then no, i can't do it. if it was on a page, then you can.
[22:27:26] <antlong_> like an actual object
[22:27:48] <bashusr> it is an actual object... it just doesn't have any getters... only an append() method
[22:58:15] <gurke_> good morning. :)
[22:58:30] <bashusr> good morning gurke_ :)
[22:58:41] <gurke_> :)
[22:58:53] <gurke_> someone should ban kisimA... :) spaming links in query when joining
[22:59:48] <Cork> gurke_: not me
[23:00:09] <gurke_> why not cork? :P
[23:00:30] <Cork> gurke_: it's your statement not mine

[23:09:07] <Duckily> i can’t seem to make prev() work. i’m trying to get the previous tr but there is a metamorph tag in between: http://pastebin.com/PZ9gjC8n
[23:09:28] <Duckily> how do i get the tr node before the spacer?
[23:09:36] <Cork> Duckily: you need prevAll().first()
[23:09:55] <Cork> Duckily: prev() checks the previous element, and only returns it if it matches the selector
[23:10:06] <Duckily> Cork: doh
[23:10:09] <Cork> it doesn't "search" for the first one matchins the selector
[23:10:14] <Duckily> they both seem to say that in the docs
[23:11:14] <Duckily> so it would be .prevAll(‘tr’).first() ?
[23:11:17] <Duckily> Cork ^
[23:11:22] <Cork> yes
[23:12:18] <Cork> Duckily: but... btw you can't have anything except tr as siblings to tr
[23:12:23] <Duckily> Cork: it doesn’t seem to be working :-(
[23:12:33] <Cork> Duckily: ya, sounds like your html is invalid
[23:12:47] <Duckily> Cork: what do you mean?
[23:12:48] <Cork> so it most likely splits it up into two tabels or something like that
[23:12:57] <Cork> Duckily: only valid sibling to tr is tr
[23:13:10] <Cork> you can't have random elements as siblings to ir
[23:13:13] <Cork> *it
[23:13:22] <Duckily> but what does it matter to jquery if its a tr or paragraph tags
[23:13:35] <Cork> Duckily: if you give the browser invalid html
[23:13:51] <Cork> it will when it parses it follow error handling trying to get a valid dom from it
[23:14:02] <Duckily> the browser renders it just fine and all the other js is working
[23:14:10] <Cork> Duckily: resulting in the dom not looking like you expect it to
[23:14:21] <Duckily> the dom looks exactly as i expext it
[23:14:37] <Cork> Duckily: what is the "metamorph" you talked about then?
[23:14:50] <Duckily> Cork: its the way emberjs handles bound dom elements
[23:14:57] <Duckily> so each tr is a bound to an object
[23:15:07] <Cork> uh... what?
[23:15:19] <Cork> Duckily: what exists in js doesn't matter
[23:15:35] <Cork> you said there was a metamorph tag in the dom
[23:15:41] <Duckily> Cork: https://github.com/tomhuda/metamorph.js/
[23:15:50] <Duckily> its a component of emberjs
[23:16:14] <Duckily> that emberjs relies on and it uses script tags through the dom for efficiency
[23:16:15] <Cork> i don't see any <metamorph> tags mentioned in there
[23:16:51] <Cork> and i hope not, cause that would make the script generate invalid pages
[23:17:35] <Duckily> Cork: have a look at the generated source code of discourse http://try.discourse.org/
[23:17:54] <Duckily> there are script metamorph tags next to the tr elements
[23:18:29] <Duckily> between the tbody and the tr
[23:18:32] <Cork> well ya, there is a <script> tag as the first member
[23:18:40] <Cork> no as the first child
[23:18:56] <Cork> are you trying to access the thead > tr?
[23:19:23] <Duckily> Cork: no i have a script tag between each tr just because each element is using a separate controller
[23:19:38] <Cork> no there is only one script tag in tbody
[23:19:39] <Duckily> but either way the script tag there is a sibiling of tr
[23:20:02] <Duckily> i know in this example because they are using one controller to manage all the records
[23:20:06] <Cork> ...
[23:20:31] <Duckily> Cork: just trust me that it’s how ember.js works?
[23:20:49] <Cork> Duckily: i clearly can't trust your description of the dom structure
[23:21:14] <Cork> and to say how you can reach your target element depends on knowing that
[23:23:22] <Duckily> Cork: ok lets say we had a <div> tag then an <h1> tag then a <div class=“spacer”>
[23:23:39] <Duckily> how do i get the previous div if there is an h1 in between?
[23:23:40] <Cork> Duckily: make a jsfiddle.net of your problem
[23:23:48] <Duckily> k
[23:30:55] <Duckily> Cork: it seems to work in my jsfiddle :-( http://jsfiddle.net/S7G5Z/
[23:32:53] <Cork> Duckily: so check your dom structure
[23:34:02] <Duckily> i mean there are a ton of metamorph tags between the two but i don’t think that should really make a difference
[23:34:25] <Cork> Duckily: your clamming that eys
[23:34:26] <Cork> *yes
[23:34:42] <Cork> though you have failed to show this mythical <metamorph> tag
[23:34:59] <Duckily> they are script tags not <metamorph>
[23:35:05] <Duckily> they have metamorph id
[23:35:10] <Cork> then don't call it metamorph tag...
[23:36:48] <Cork> Duckily: but my request still stands, reproduce the problem in a jsfiddle
[23:37:00] <Cork> so ppl can have a look at the problem
[23:37:02] <Duckily> Cork: http://ge.tt/6Lstpdk1/v/0
[23:37:12] <Duckily> Cork: i can’t reproduce it thats the problem im trying
[23:37:28] <Duckily> there is a shitton of html that would take me a while to copy over in a legible way
[23:40:31] <Duckily> Cork i don’t know what the difference in concept is between that screenshot and the jsfiddle
[23:54:34] <Amnesia> Cork: do you have any idea how I can get jquery's datepicker to highlight an entire week, and then select the first day of that week?
[23:54:46] <Amnesia> it looks like "selectWeek"'s deprecated nowadays
[23:59:32] <Cork> Amnesia: nope
[23:59:45] <Cork> you might need to use an extending plugin for that
[23:59:46] <Cork> but not sure
