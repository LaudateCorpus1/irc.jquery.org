[03:00:22] <cmehrabian> Hey guys! I was wondering if there was a way to alter a js script after a page has loaded. Having some browser specific issues
[04:09:47] <robhol> sounds like an XY problem. what's the actual issue?
[05:09:07] <ZeuZ> the callback from animate() is called yet the animation was not performed, what could be the problem?
[05:09:21] <ZeuZ> I can do the animation from the developer console without a problem with the same code
[06:40:27] <fas3r> hello
[07:59:25] <hardyred> Hi there
[07:59:53] <hardyred> I am working with angular and whenever I change pages my scrollTop function stops working
[08:00:04] <hardyred> basically it seems to stop tracking where my scrollbar is, anyone have any ideas?
[08:05:48] <JosefDe> Hi guys. I'm cloning an html-element. But if I try setting a data to another value after the cloning, it keeps the old data-value. Why?
[08:09:44] <JosefDe> Ah ok, I've found out something
[08:10:00] <JosefDe> It works when I do .attr('my-data','myval'), but not with .data('my-data','myval'). Why?
[08:10:50] <taplar> how are you trying to get the value later?
[08:15:16] <decx> if you want a custom attribute it has to be data-my-data
[08:45:52] <jak2000> with jquery how to simulate clicking to a input type="reset" ?
[08:46:53] <Kartagis> $("input[type='reset']").click()
[08:47:30] <jak2000> ok
[08:47:35] <jak2000> Kartagis: see http://jsfiddle.net/6e15hu4e/
[08:48:02] <jak2000> i need on the form have a button type reset?
[08:56:42] <Kartagis> if you need to
[09:10:45] <decx> you can just call reset() on your form
[09:19:00] <hellyeah> hey
[09:19:41] <hellyeah> button.data("smt") and button.attr("data-button", "smt") similar thing?
[09:20:38] <timaaarrreee>  I've created a wee tiled canvas thingy at https://udraw.me which uses a canvas to multiplayer draw with websocket. would appreciate it if anyone could try draw on it
[09:24:10] <Kartagis> hellyeah: yes
[09:24:20] <timaaarrreee> (thanks whoever is drawing! Really need to figure out how to iterpolate draw calls between mouse move events)
[09:24:45] <decx> works well
[09:25:10] <timaaarrreee> Thanks! Drawings are saved on redis
[09:25:48] <hellyeah> why it doesnt woek then https://jsfiddle.net/bj8g5f6h/3/
[09:25:50] <decx> i think you need a prevenDefault on middle mousebutton
[09:26:04] <decx> panning is a bit of a pain with it
[09:26:47] <decx> or maybe it's because you load the outer regions for panning?
[09:27:03] <hellyeah> work*
[09:27:28] <timaaarrreee> decx: works okay for me is there a (<>) icon thingy displaying for you? Loading on pan isn't working that well.
[09:27:59] <decx> yeah it shows the scroll up/down cursor
[09:28:11] <taplar> hellyeah, what does not work? https://jsfiddle.net/bj8g5f6h/4/
[09:28:55] <hellyeah> sup undefined
[09:28:57] <hellyeah> second one
[09:29:04] <taplar> that works fine
[09:29:07] <timaaarrreee> decx: ah right. I might bind WASD & arrows to have that option there to. I'm on mac and dont see the up/down cursor
[09:29:10] <taplar> there is not a data element for that one
[09:29:11] <decx> when you have the brush options open and draw through them the draw action stops, i dont know about the logistics but i think the drawing should be separated from the ui itself
[09:29:39] <decx> like when you are in an active stroke you need a mouseup on the canvas
[09:30:16] <Kartagis> https://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/bj8g5f6h/6/
[09:30:34] <Kartagis> hellyeah: ^
[09:30:45] <timaaarrreee> brush options gets in the way and cancels the stroke. I might add a 'pointer-events: none' css when a stroke is in action.
[09:30:52] <decx> i'll dig out my wacom and try some circles
[09:31:57] <timaaarrreee> decx: Nice. I have a medium intuos pro. Would be nice if there was a web api for getting pressure! I could do it with the wacom plugin
[09:32:14] <hellyeah> i understand
[09:32:31] <hellyeah> so i need to put information to data-button and stringify it
[09:32:34] <hellyeah> is it taplar
[09:34:33] <decx> when i try a circle with the tablet it's dotted, with mouse it isn't as much
[09:35:57] <timaaarrreee> decx: Yeah I would have thought the tablet provides more events to call drawCircle. The line tool is funny to use with a large strokewidth
[09:36:53] <timaaarrreee> decx: I might work on interpolating draw calls to make everything smooth tomorrow.
[09:37:02] <decx> it's very nice so far
[09:37:14] <decx> maybe you'd like this old thing i did last year http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Ca9Y7/
[09:38:42] <timaaarrreee> decx: wow that's fun!
[09:39:14] <decx> inspired by the kill bill intro
[09:39:21] <decx> or something like that
[09:40:33] <decx> no it was something else
[09:40:40] <decx> blood splatter for the creditscene
[09:40:43] <decx> can't remember
[09:41:38] <Kartagis> do I still need to use $("canvas")[0] if I'm aiming to get based64 from multiple canvases?
[09:41:44] <timaaarrreee> I have no idea how I'll able to gurantee consistiency when someone draws over the same 'tile' region when there is a race condition. I was thinking about creating a region lock protection feature
[09:44:08] <decx> Kartagis:  well a jquery object canvas doesn'T have toDataUrl()
[09:44:49] <Kartagis> so that means yes
[09:44:56] <Kartagis> right?
[09:45:05] <decx> it might ^^
[09:46:35] <timaaarrreee> canvas element has toDataUrl() I then convert the base64 to a Blob and send it as a POST during the mouseup event
[09:47:20] <timaaarrreee> *actually its a PUT. server never supplies blank tiles which haven't been updated
[09:53:50] <decx> panning seems to offset some of the regions
[09:55:30] <timaaarrreee> decx: I really need to refactor create some tests to test. I had a bit of a nightmare getting it working on retina screens
[09:56:19] <decx> i can only imagine complications, keep at it
[09:56:30] <decx> *the complications
[09:57:11] <timaaarrreee> It even almost works on Edge apart from the fact that it completely deletes everything you draw over. *sigh*
[09:57:54] <timaaarrreee> And PNGs can get worryingly big fron toDataURL() up to 250kb for a 256x tile
[09:58:30] <decx> tried an approach where you only save strokes?
[09:58:52] <decx> stroke from x,y to x1,y1 with settings n
[09:59:21] <decx> then again depending on drawstyle that might end up with even more data ^^
[10:00:42] <timaaarrreee> I had an old version that did something like that. When you connected it would download a lzw compressed json array of the entire draw action stack.
[10:01:40] <timaaarrreee> I tried using the same spehrical mercator system google uses as a coordinate system with openlayers but that got too hard.
[10:14:46] <hellyeah> so can i treat this like a regular array http://jsfiddle.net/ba16wv3f/
[10:25:26] <hellyeah> yo
[10:25:43] <hellyeah> why each is not working in this cas do i need to use forEacht? http://jsfiddle.net/ba16wv3f/4/
[10:28:07] <hellyeah> come on
[10:28:23] <shoky> hellyeah: k is an array, not a jquery object.  arrays don't have .each
[10:29:09] <hellyeah> always forget wrap it with $ DAMN http://jsfiddle.net/ba16wv3f/6/
[10:29:20] <hellyeah> is it acceptable to do like that?
[10:29:25] <shoky> no
[10:29:33] <shoky> not by me anyway :D
[10:29:40] <hellyeah> :p
[10:29:40] <shoky> arrays have .forEach
[10:29:45] <hellyeah> ic
[10:30:31] <hellyeah> hahaha
[10:30:46] <hellyeah> change the place opf index and element so it i,s done http://jsfiddle.net/ba16wv3f/8/
[10:30:47] <hellyeah> xD
[11:06:47] <Duikb00t> Hello
[11:06:51] <Duikb00t> Can someone help me out http://codepen.io/wardkennes/pen/MaVWXM
[11:07:27] <Duikb00t> I wrote that so far. But I would like when I click on the red items the content changes ( as you can see in the html code) i made already 5 dummy divs with an other classname.
[11:07:31] <Duikb00t> What's the best way to do that?
[11:07:34] <Duikb00t> Thanks a lot!
[11:24:52] <mozzarella> I need help
[11:29:42] <mozzarella> anyone familiar with greasemonkey?
[11:38:23] <robhol> don't ask to ask, etc
[11:45:11] <Kamuela> robhol: i think that it's psychologically natural to ask to ask, it builds suspense, buy-in, and investment. i'm not saying it isn't annoying
[11:45:43] <robhol> no, what it actually does is create a pointless threshold and extra step
[11:46:58] <robhol> it IS natural to ask to ask, but it's an impulse that only really gets in the way
[11:48:19] <mozzarella> when I require jquery, it seems to mess with the jquery the website is already using (two different versions)
[12:12:45] <hellyeah> hey how can  i get the content of array to data of button do i need two foreach or smt http://jsfiddle.net/ba16wv3f/16/
[13:03:21] <Robdgreat> asking to ask forces someone to commit, even if implicitly, to answering a question without first knowing what the question is
[13:04:08] <Robdgreat> I regularly fall victim to that nonsense. I speak up to tell someone just ask their question and they take it as me volunteering to help
[14:08:26] <Duikb00t> Made some progress already: http://codepen.io/wardkennes/pen/MaVWXM
[14:34:14] <chars6> what does "ReferenceError: False is not defined" mean?
[14:34:24] <chars6> i'm seeing it when i run a form's submit method
[14:34:40] <chars6> this line, to be specific:  $('#shipping-form').submit(function(e) {
[14:38:44] <robhol> chars6: false*
[14:42:16] <chars6> robhol: i don't follow. what do you mean?
[14:42:37] <robhol> lower case
[14:43:03] <chars6> no, that error was copy/pasted directly from firebug
[14:43:19] <robhol> ... yes
[14:43:29] <robhol> and it's complaining that "False" is not defined
[14:43:36] <robhol> "false" is
[14:43:59] <chars6> it's poinitng to the '$' i'm thinking maybe jquery isn't loaded correctly? I don't have a 'false' on that line
[14:44:17] <chars6> nor above it, or below
[14:44:42] <robhol> I think I'd need to see the code
[14:48:58] <chars6> robhol: http://pastebin.com/YbXfvGD9
[14:49:32] <chars6> robhol: there is something else that makes it a little more complicated. this is all in a div that gets loaded via ajax
[14:50:13] <chars6> i'm considering going back and removing the ajax, but i kinda don't want to throw all this code out
[14:51:21] <chars6> wait, shit, that was from the wrong file
[14:51:49] <chars6> this is it: http://pastebin.com/1aSLB9gN
[14:52:24] <robhol> can't see anything obviously wrong in it
[14:52:36] <chars6> so basically this is all part of a user account section
[14:52:45] <robhol> try enabling "break on exceptions" and look at the stack trace
[14:52:45] <gnarf> can you check the output of the template chars6 ??
[14:52:56] <chars6> left side of the page has a few clickable elements
[14:52:58] <gnarf> I assume {% %} means python/jinja ?
[14:53:03] <chars6> yeah, django
[14:53:12] <gnarf> can you look at what the rendered .js looks like?
[14:53:13] <gnarf> also
[14:53:37] <gnarf> why not just use $(this) instead of $('form') and also use $(this).attr('action') to get the URL ?
[14:54:39] <gnarf> in general, i find its bad form/practice to write js code inside another template language
[14:55:07] <gnarf> its possible your {% url %} is outputting something that includes a python False somehow
[14:55:44] <gnarf> its usually better to write real JS that reads the values it needs from the DOM nodes
[15:07:56] <robhol> I still can't really wrap my head around what you're doing here
[15:12:28] <chars6> robhol: i fixed it, although i'm still not sure what was wrong
[15:12:48] <chars6> robhol: i commented out another script farther down the page and now i'm not seeing the error
[15:12:57] <chars6> robhol: and thanks.
[15:32:08] <hex`> What's the best way to get the jQuery object when using find? For example, currently what I'm doing is: var $infodiv = $($(this).parents().find("div#message"));
[15:32:14] <hex`> But is there a better way?
[15:38:32] <nodist> whats the layout? find should return a jquery collection also you can do parent
[15:47:07] <hex`> nodist, tks
[16:11:51] <robhol> hex`: do you even need to? I think you already get a wrapped object from .find
[16:24:50] <jeffreylevesque> anyone here know about jshint?
[16:58:09] <cmehrabian> Hello all, Im attempting to alter a JS script in the browser for I have browser specific issue. The window.location.href = is not working for firefox, it works chrome,safari but not in firefox. Is there any way I can change script text in the console so I can automate tests?
[17:42:10] <roger_padactor> anyone use the jquery.countdown ?
[17:42:30] <roger_padactor> its working for me but its not showing the actual count down.
[17:48:41] <roger_padactor> seems to only work if its inline script
[17:55:31] <Hvk> hey, how to import only ajax from jquery?
[18:06:23] <Cork> Hvk: as far as i know, you can't
[18:06:46] <Cork> you might be able to ripp it out from the unminified version
[18:06:48] <Hvk> Cork: https://github.com/jquery/jquery#modules and what about this?
[18:06:49] <Cork> but i don
[18:06:57] <Cork> don't think it is a support way to do it
[18:07:28] <Cork> interesting
[18:07:37] <Cork> Hvk: so ya, but you would have to compile it your self
[18:07:52] <Hvk> i can i am bulding anyway with webpack
[18:08:43] <Hvk> i had something like this import ajax from 'jquery/src/ajax';
[18:09:11] <Hvk> but there was problem with selecotr i imported selector and still there was problem so i dont know what exactly i need to import
[18:09:14] <Hvk> i had core and selector
[18:10:45] <Cork> Hvk: modules isn
[18:11:11] <Cork> isn't the same as the source folders
[18:11:44] <Cork> jquery needs to be run through grunt to get a usable result
[18:11:57] <Hvk> yea i am using webpack
[18:12:06] <Hvk> it should work same way or?
[18:12:41] <Cork> not sure, never used it
[18:13:54] <Cork> it looks like it works similar to grunt, so ya i would guess so
[19:26:11] <derekZero_> Why would a jQuery animation moving an object on a horizontal axis on load delay for the first 10 seconds?
[19:31:38] <Kamuela> are you waiting for the right elements to be loaded?
[19:33:02] <derekZero_> It's on document .ready
[19:33:22] <derekZero_> Well... Now that I think about it, it is after another element in that same syntax bracket
[19:34:06] <derekZero_> I have an object animating after another waits for document ready.
[21:24:24] <Jckf> The documentation for getScript() says the the callback is invoked once the request succeeds, but the script might not yet be executed. The usage example on the same page shows immediate use of the script that was loaded inside the callback.
[21:24:28] <Jckf> How reliable is this?
[22:40:29] <gambl0re> !ops
[22:45:10] <Justice> im trying to get filterable listviews however how do I initiate the filter form ?
[22:45:39] <Justice> I did a custom download of the filterable and listview, listview works but it does not style the filterable and it also does not work.
[23:11:14] <derekZero_> Can I apply the .click function using text as the clickable item?
[23:11:34] <rcyr> No, you need a node.
[23:11:44] <derekZero_> hmm
[23:12:09] <rcyr> Just wrap the text with some tag.
[23:12:21] <rcyr> Then add the click handler to that tag.
[23:12:49] <derekZero_> I think I did that.
[23:12:56] <derekZero_> I have a div with an id that's selected.
[23:14:08] <rcyr> So doing $('#theIdOfTheDiv').click(function() { alert('hello'); }); would alert 'hello' when clicking on that div.
[23:40:08] <arup_r> when clickin the paste 2 Ajax call is happening. Why? http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/avYZde
[23:58:50] <derekZero_> The orange box doesn't animate above the other elements on the page when About Me is clicked, why? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/qOoNdB
