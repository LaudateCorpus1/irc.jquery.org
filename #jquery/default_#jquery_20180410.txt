[02:02:47] <jak2000> hi all
[02:02:55] <jak2000> exist a sleep function?
[02:03:03] <Cork> setTimeout
[02:03:14] <jak2000> settimeout every x milliseconds reactivate
[02:03:19] <jak2000> i want only 1 time (wait)
[02:03:29] <Cork> no that's setInterval
[02:03:41] <jak2000> but can execute 1 time?
[02:04:01] <Cork> jak2000: https://developer.mozilla.org/ro/docs/Web/API/window.setTimeout
[02:07:51] <jak2000> ok thx
[02:14:15] <jak2000> :(
[02:16:43] <Cork> ?
[02:18:08] <Cork> jak2000: if you have a specific problem try asking about THAT instead of the specific solution you think you need
[02:21:25] <jak2000> $('#selCliente').change();   <--- this fill a select option
[02:21:55] <jak2000> $('#selCliente').change(json.xIdPedido); $('#selMPedido').val(json.xIdPedido);   (first exeute the second instruction, thank change method why?
[02:22:24] <Cork> wait what?
[02:22:37] <Cork> is xIDPedido a function or a value?
[02:23:06] <jak2000> is a value
[02:23:16] <Cork> then $('#selCliente').change(json.xIdPedido); can't work
[02:23:27] <jak2000> i know
[02:23:59] <jak2000> also i try: $('#selCliente').change(); $('#selMPedido').val(json.xIdPedido);    ( iwant after fill the select option: #selMPedido  set the value
[02:24:29] <Cork> ok, so you have an event handler that populates the element
[02:24:42] <Cork> how does it populate the element? (you should really create a jsfiddle...)
[02:25:08] <jak2000> mm in change event i fill/populate with an ajax call...
[02:25:18] <Cork> and there's your problem
[02:25:42] <jak2000> how to wait to populate
[02:25:48] <jak2000> finish..
[02:25:49] <Cork> you can't react on the new options synchronously after an async action
[02:25:55] <Cork> you can't
[02:26:28] <Cork> the ajax will have to provide a callback solution you can hook into
[02:27:06] <jak2000> ok
[02:27:13] <jak2000> async: false,  :)
[02:27:15] <jak2000> testing
[02:27:52] <devi8> Good morning. Anybody know how to simulate spray paint to create a "graffitti" look using canvas and jquery?
[02:30:48] <Cork> jak2000: async: false is depricated and will be removed (if it isn't already)
[02:30:54] <Cork> jak2000: so that is the wrong solution
[02:31:13] <Cork> (it is also the wrong solution for other reasons)
[02:31:32] <Cork> jak2000: so just add a callback solution instead, it isn't that hard
[02:31:40] <jak2000> ok
[02:32:04] <Cork> devi8: jquery has zero features for working with canvas
[02:32:13] <devi8> Drats.
[02:32:17] <Cork> except actually selecting the canvas element
[02:32:29] <jak2000> Cork work beautiful with async:false
[02:32:37] <jak2000> googling about callback
[02:33:13] <Cork> jak2000: except, 1. it will freeze the page (including redraw) until the server answers, 2. in some browsers will freeze the browser ui
[02:33:22] <Cork> 3. and is _depricated_
[02:34:07] <Cork> so no it won't work beautifully
[02:34:17] <devi8> Maybe I'll just do a bunch of short animated images loaded on top of each other. Seems bulky, but it might work.
[02:34:50] <Cork> devi8: i can guarantee you can find a lib for it
[02:35:39] <Cork> devi8: there is litterally pages of hits https://www.startpage.com/do/search?query=javascript%20canvas%20spraypaint
[02:36:00] <devi8> I
[02:36:18] <devi8> i;ll keep looking, thanks for the input. Haven't found one that seems reasonable.
[02:36:38] <Cork> jquery is for dom manipulation and as canvas doesn't have dom it is out of scope for jquery
[02:41:03] <raymond_> Ok... I'm not sure how jsbin.com works. But this is what I have: http://jsbin.com/sirokopani/edit?html,js,output
[02:41:28] <raymond_> When I run this in my browser (Chrome) I receive the following error: SyntaxError: Unexpected token < in JSON at position 1
[02:42:06] <raymond_> The alert() shows what I expect to see, thus I'm confused about the error message.
[02:43:03] <raymond_> I'll be honest and say I really don't  understand the code, it was stolen from elsewhere and I'm trying to adapt it to my needs.
[02:45:20] <Cork> raymond_: you don't need processData: false so send json
[02:45:38] <Cork> and it is hard to say why you get the error, the code you pasted doesn't
[02:46:04] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/Lwdrm6qp/ <-- fixed example
[02:46:28] <Cork> btw don't use event attributes, they have a ton of problems
[02:46:34] <Cork> use event listeners instead
[02:46:45] <Cork> (also don't use alert for debugging)
[02:47:27] <raymond_> Cork: Ok... I'm new to front end coding. :/
[02:47:46] <raymond_> Cork: When I swap out my code for yours, I now get the error "JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 2 of the JSON data"
[02:48:20] <raymond_> What should I use instead of alert()?
[02:48:41] <Cork> raymond_: https://jsfiddle.net/Lwdrm6qp/4/
[02:49:10] <Cork> opps forgot to remove the onClick="" https://jsfiddle.net/Lwdrm6qp/5/
[02:49:40] <Cork> -_-' and fucked up the id attribute... https://jsfiddle.net/Lwdrm6qp/7/
[02:49:46] <raymond_> ah, ok. I see what console.log() is doing. Thank you.
[02:50:25] <Cork> raymond_: also don't forget "var" infront of your variable declarations
[02:50:41] <Cork> else you create page globals, and you don't want functions to step over each other
[02:54:00] <raymond_> Cork: Ah, makes sense.
[02:54:20] <raymond_> Cork: Ok, I changed my code to match yours, now nothing is happening. :/
[02:54:37] <raymond_> I am not even getting the json string in the console.
[02:54:44] <Cork> 1. make sure the $().on() runs in a $(function() {}) or onload event
[02:54:53] <Cork> else the element you're looking for won't exist
[02:55:03] <Cork> except for that it should work
[02:55:48] <raymond_> I don't have anything that looks like $().on() in the code anywhere.
[02:56:07] <Cork> then you don't have an event listener so nothing will happen :)
[02:56:23] <Cork> look at the top of the javascript section
[02:56:31] <Cork> (first line)
[02:56:36] <raymond_> ah, ok.
[02:56:43] <raymond_> .on('click'....
[02:56:49] <Cork> yup
[02:57:17] <raymond_> ...
[02:57:21] <Cork> but remember you want $(function() { $('').on('click' ... /* rest of function */ });
[02:57:25] <raymond_> This is just seems to be going backwards.
[02:58:12] <raymond_> When I had a named function, at least it would execute.
[02:58:16] <raymond_> Now I have nothing.
[02:58:29] <raymond_> And I'm at a loss as to understand why. :/
[02:58:51] <Cork> raymond_: it should look like this https://jsfiddle.net/Lwdrm6qp/9/
[02:59:01] <Cork> make sure it matches
[02:59:29] <raymond_> Oh... I was missing line 1.
[02:59:34] <Cork> ...
[02:59:49] <raymond_> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/Lwdrm6qp/7/
[02:59:55] <Cork> (that i told you three times to add...)
[02:59:55] <raymond_> it's not in that fiddle.
[03:00:20] <raymond_> Sure, but when one doesn't understand the nomenclature, it's very difficult to follow.
[03:00:43] <Cork> $(function() {}) is a function in jquery that waits for the dom to be constructed
[03:01:06] <Cork> without it the code executes directly, and depending on where you load it that might be before the element exists
[03:01:55] <raymond_> Ok, at least now I'm back to seeing information (and the error) in the console.
[03:02:20] <Cork> raymond_: what is the network console showing as the response from the server?
[03:05:08] <raymond_> Nothing. :/
[03:05:23] <raymond_> I lied... "Error"
[03:05:36] <Cork> so not json
[03:05:46] <Cork> that is why you get the parsing error
[03:05:52] <raymond_> Yup, that would be correct. Ok, that's back to something I can fix.
[03:06:46] <raymond_> Ok... now I'm getting some interesting PHP error. :/
[03:15:49] <raymond_> Cork: Humm... I am not seeing the data being sent as either GET or POST.
[03:16:25] <Cork> should be as a post
[03:16:46] <Cork> check the network console in the browser you should see a line for rnd_ajax_test.php
[03:17:03] <raymond_> I do.
[03:17:18] <Cork> but not on the server side?
[03:17:58] <raymond_> That's what I would think. However when I var_dump() $_POST it's empty.
[03:18:27] <Cork> btw check the "Request Payload" part in headers
[03:19:03] <Cork> it should contain {"edit_qpr":"280970"}
[03:19:03] <raymond_> There is no entry by that name.
[03:19:23] <Cork> that... is weird...
[03:19:35] <Cork> is this ajax call cross domain?
[03:20:07] <raymond_> No, it's all running a local dev VM.
[03:20:16] <raymond_> (linux)
[03:20:18] <Cork> localhost or file:// ?
[03:20:30] <Cork> (for the page)
[03:20:41] <raymond_> http://devhost/rnd_edit_test.php
[03:20:45] <Cork> hmm
[03:20:58] * Cork scratches his head...
[03:21:40] <raymond_> Where would I find the "Headers" tab in Chrome?
[03:21:55] <raymond_> (I've been in FF, but figured I'd check another browser)
[03:22:06] <Cork> click the line in the network console
[03:22:14] <Cork> you should get a tabbed view to the right
[03:22:35] <Cork> at the bottom of "Headers" you should have "Request Payload"
[03:23:03] <raymond_> Nope. :/
[03:24:14] <raymond_> https://pasteboard.co/HfVVJBv.png
[03:24:21] <Cork> raymond_: https://jsfiddle.net/Lwdrm6qp/12/ works (with modifications to match what /echo/json/ expects) on jsfiddle
[03:25:19] <Cork> raymond_: you need to find the post
[03:25:38] <raymond_> Cork: I do understand, and I'm looking. :/
[03:25:43] <Cork> scroll to the bottom
[03:25:54] <raymond_> Ah, got it, thank you.
[03:27:03] <raymond_> Ok, chrome shows request payload.
[03:27:27] <Cork> so the problem is server side
[03:27:48] <raymond_> I guess... Thank you.
[05:24:03] <ledtc> Q: Ive got this Select form, and i try to get the .change function to trigger, but when an option is selected but nothing. https://jsfiddle.net/m0xszwav/2/
[05:24:57] <Uhkis_> ledtc: you dont have jquery in that fiddle
[05:25:18] <ledtc> woops 1 sec
[05:27:40] <Cork> ledtc: also note change doesn't trigger for keyinputs on select elements
[05:27:56] <ledtc> https://jsfiddle.net/m0xszwav/5/
[05:28:20] <ledtc> it works, thou i did not think a triggerd function needed to be inside a document ready function, thats odd.
[05:28:21] <Cork> ledtc: no need to move the script code https://jsfiddle.net/m0xszwav/7/
[05:29:29] <ledtc> Cork, ohh thats how the fiddle works
[05:29:44] <ledtc> I just need to move this over the my flask project and see if it still ticks.
[05:30:00] <Cork> ledtc: you normally need it inside $(function() {}), but jsfiddle puts the script section in a onload by default
[05:30:13] <Cork> that is why it works without
[05:30:33] <ledtc> ohhh okey
[05:31:10] <Cork> with some config changes: https://jsfiddle.net/m0xszwav/8/
[05:32:55] <ledtc> Cork, ahh okey.
[05:33:01] <ledtc> Thanks for the help guys.
[05:44:22] <AnGe7> hey all
[05:45:30] <AnGe7> someone can say me why this selector don't work : var x = $('form#myFirstId, form[id^="initialId_"]'); ?
[05:45:46] <AnGe7> we can't mix selector ?
[05:47:42] <Cork> AnGe7: you can, but don't use attribute selectors for ids
[05:48:00] <Cork> just add a class to the inputs and select on that
[05:48:19] <AnGe7> i can't #legacyCode
[05:48:26] <Cork> also no point in having form#<id> the id is already unique
[05:48:44] <Cork> AnGe7: and legacy code doesn't let you add a class to the elements??
[05:48:50] <AnGe7> but id is dynamical
[05:48:58] <Cork> ya, so add a CLASS
[05:49:02] <AnGe7> form#prefix_+timestamp()
[05:49:19] <AnGe7> i can't
[05:49:22] <Cork> and again you don't need the tagname infront of an id
[05:49:29] <AnGe7> i don't wand modify thousand form
[06:46:11] <IamTrying> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/NyW7hD2kdX/ - jQuery v3.2.1, Why error?
[07:02:57] <pavonia> IamTrying: You're not returning the result object from your function
[07:03:47] <IamTrying> pavonia: return true or false is returned in line 8, 11
[07:05:48] <pavonia> No, from funtion write_log_promise
[07:07:02] <pavonia> That funtion has no return value
[07:07:13] <pavonia> *function :S
[07:24:46] <Cork> IamTrying: the return in line 8 and 11 is for the value you get in then, not from write_log_promise
[07:24:54] <Cork> so what pavonia said is correct
[07:25:11] <IamTrying> OK - thank you
[07:25:16] <IamTrying> confused myself
[07:25:38] <Cork> IamTrying: you want a return on line 4
[07:25:45] <Cork> return $.post(...
[07:26:06] <Cork> hmm, actually what i said isn't correct...
[07:26:27] <Cork> the return isn't in a promise so the return on line 8 and 11 has no result
[07:26:45] <Cork> $.post().then(function() {}) would do what i said
[07:28:13] <IamTrying> OK - thank you
[11:14:03] <ExoUNX> morning
[11:14:23] <ExoUNX> the focus() and select() functions don't seem to work on mobile devices
[11:14:31] <ExoUNX> is there a reason and alternative for this?
[12:40:34] <ExoUNX> any love?
[15:59:20] <Levin^> hello
[15:59:22] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/mxoday?editors=1010
[15:59:44] <Levin^> I have a small problem on making the title to show up for only the correct element
[15:59:52] <Levin^> my code is incomplete
[16:00:18] <Levin^> True title #1 should only show at the red line
[16:00:33] <Levin^> True title #2 at the green line
[16:00:42] <taplar> you have to loop over the elements
[16:00:47] <Levin^> hm
[16:01:12] <Levin^> loop, loop hmm
[16:01:17] <Levin^> I remember that
[16:01:59] <taplar> or wait, you only want to change the first one?
[16:02:40] <Levin^> no, it should run as long as there are elements available
[16:02:58] <taplar> yeah, then you need to loop
[16:07:50] <Levin^> jQuery.each?
[16:07:59] <taplar> yup
[16:08:03] <Levin^> ok
[16:08:11] <taplar> $(selector).each version
[16:09:47] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/mxoday?editors=1010
[16:10:03] <Levin^> oh
[16:10:10] <Levin^> no, it's not that simple lol
[16:10:21] <taplar> :)
[16:11:21] <taplar> i would probably loop over the '#modified > div'
[16:11:48] <taplar> and maybe give the div a shared class, so you can select that rather than the '> div'
[16:21:33] <codecutter> why is moment.js returning 'in 6 months' when date  & time is only a few mins away from now? https://jsfiddle.net/rLjQx/40771/
[16:22:01] <codecutter> relative to urc
[16:23:43] <codecutter> anyone?
[16:24:26] <taplar> i'm not intimately familiar with the nuts and bolts of moment.
[16:25:06] <taplar> but it looks like you are giving it a day in october
[16:25:12] <taplar> mm-dd-yyyy
[16:25:55] <codecutter> yea, just noticed the format
[16:31:39] <Levin^> I feel I'm almost there https://codepen.io/anon/pen/mxoday?editors=1010
[16:36:42] <Levin^> taplar, where do I put the t I created?
[16:42:59] <ledtc> Q: the right way to do this $("input[id='{{info[0]}}']").change(function()   ??
[16:43:34] <ledtc> $("input[id='5']").change(function()
[16:43:57] <ledtc> ohh wait the id needs to be on the select tag... hold on
[16:45:46] <shoky_> Levin^: you can use $(this) and .find()  https://codepen.io/anon/pen/YagXQY
[16:47:23] <Levin^> shoky_: oh, thanks
[16:47:32] <taplar> sorry, got called away for work stuff
[16:48:32] <Levin^> np
[17:00:23] <ledtc> Ok, so ive got a lot of select inputs, and i need to make identifier for them. https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/92392/  Im thinking if using id="VALUE" then just fetch the other value with .attri function i belive?
[17:00:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:01:43] <robertmaxrees> ledtc "i need to make identifier for them" - do you mean you need to know which select changed?
[17:02:01] <ledtc> robertmaxrees, The function     $(?).change(function() as per say the "?" it cant just type "id=5"
[17:02:11] <robertmaxrees> you can just select all inputs.
[17:02:26] <robertmaxrees> or use a class.
[17:03:05] <ledtc> robertmaxrees, i know the class medthod i just do ".5" and im done, but how do you do it with custom attributes ?
[17:03:17] <robertmaxrees> so uh
[17:03:25] <robertmaxrees> why do you need custom attributes?
[17:04:38] <ledtc> easier to keep track then calling it class and i might need two
[17:04:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:04:50] <ledtc>     $(? and ?).change(function() {
[17:05:08] <robertmaxrees> you should just need the one class though...
[17:05:18] <robertmaxrees> like, why would you need two classes for this?
[17:05:51] <ledtc> perhaps i could do an ifstatement inside, but still if dont want class or id how do i do it ?
[17:06:15] <ledtc> And were do i read up on it, i dont even know what to google for :(
[17:06:20] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:06:29] <robertmaxrees> what I'm saying is you don't want to do that in general.
[17:06:35] <robertmaxrees> they're called attribute selectors.
[17:06:37] <robertmaxrees> but you want to avoid them.
[17:07:01] <ledtc> robertmaxrees, okey...
[17:09:02] <ledtc> thanks thou
[17:10:32] <robertmaxrees> why do you want to avoid classes?
[17:14:33] <ledtc> i just wanted to name them something i could relate to
[17:14:40] <grapheti> Don't have any class?
[17:15:15] <robertmaxrees> ledtc you can do that with classes.  that's part of the point :)
[17:15:25] <grapheti> https://media3.giphy.com/media/NIIOo5OL6BB8A/giphy.gif
[17:16:05] <ledtc> thou i went the class, trying my hand on the next thing...     $(".{{info[0]}}").change(function() {
[17:16:05] <ledtc>       alert( ( "this" ).attr( "class" ) );
[17:16:05] <ledtc>     });
[17:16:20] <ledtc> thou "this" is probably the wrong syntax
[17:16:20] <robertmaxrees> woah hey
[17:16:21] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:16:27] <robertmaxrees> please don't paste code into the channel; :)
[17:16:31] <robertmaxrees> update your fiddle.
[17:17:27] <ledtc> how do you comment a line i js ?
[17:17:39] <robertmaxrees> two slashes: // some comment
[17:18:26] <ledtc> thanks, https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/92526/
[17:18:44] <robertmaxrees> ern.,
[17:18:46] <robertmaxrees> *erm
[17:18:50] <robertmaxrees> #{% for info in data %}
[17:19:02] <robertmaxrees> you aren't generating code in PHP or something, right?
[17:19:18] <ledtc> python flask
[17:19:31] <robertmaxrees> nonono
[17:19:37] <ledtc> 0:)
[17:19:42] <robertmaxrees> heh don't do that.
[17:19:45] <robertmaxrees> it's a bad idea.
[17:19:58] <ledtc> Murphys law, if it works its not stupid.
[17:20:08] <robertmaxrees> i didn't say it was stupid.
[17:20:11] <robertmaxrees> i said it was a bad idea.
[17:20:14] <robertmaxrees> big different :)
[17:20:14] <ledtc> true
[17:20:17] <robertmaxrees> *difference
[17:20:18] <ledtc> (:
[17:20:30] <robertmaxrees> generating code using another programming language is a bad idea.
[17:20:39] <robertmaxrees> so.
[17:20:50] <robertmaxrees> what ~exactly~ are you trying to do?
[17:22:04] <ledtc> Okey ive got the big table of select form, and when you update one i need it to trigger an jquerry function that posts the change to my backend in python with addition information so that i know exactly wich one to update
[17:22:04] <Robdgreat> ledtc: that's not Murphy's law, btw
[17:22:49] <ledtc> Robdgreat, its one of them. But you're probably only firmiliar with the most common one of "if something can break, some one will break it"
[17:23:25] <Robdgreat> Murphy's law is "Anything that can go wrong will"
[17:24:59] <Robdgreat> "Murphy's law" isn't synonymous with "a cynical adage". Murphy was an actual guy, and he didn't say all the things you're no doubt attributing to him
[17:25:42] <Robdgreat> aaaaand I've been trolled.
[17:25:44] * Robdgreat shuts up
[17:26:14] <ledtc> what
[17:26:19] <ledtc> (Y)
[17:26:43] <ledtc> robertmaxrees, yous till there ?
[17:28:45] <robertmaxrees> sorry, was away for a sec.
[17:29:05] <robertmaxrees> okay so.
[17:29:09] <robertmaxrees> you only need one handler for that.
[17:29:25] <robertmaxrees> so when the select changes, you want to know the ID and Value of the select i assume?
[17:30:08] <robertmaxrees> ledtc
[17:31:08] <ledtc> robertmaxrees, Yes that would be accurate.
[17:31:12] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:31:34] <robertmaxrees> so first of all, how would you bind a change handler to all selects?
[17:32:15] <ledtc> robertmaxrees, i could give all the selects in question the same class
[17:32:27] <robertmaxrees> there's one way :)
[17:32:41] <robertmaxrees> so give that a shot.
[17:33:18] <robertmaxrees> brb
[17:37:12] <ledtc> robertmaxrees, well im not having that munch luck. https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/92631/
[17:38:58] <robertmaxrees> back.
[17:40:26] <robertmaxrees> okay so.
[17:40:50] <robertmaxrees> (this)
[17:41:00] <robertmaxrees> what does a jquery selector normally look like?
[17:41:44] <ledtc> Booh Ya! it need a $
[17:41:48] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:41:56] <robertmaxrees> so now.
[17:42:06] <robertmaxrees> i would avoid using custom attribute names.
[17:42:06] <ledtc> so now i get the others and a post function
[17:42:47] <ledtc> ohh, i need to get the value of the option selcted... hmmm
[17:42:57] <robertmaxrees> that's actually really easy :)
[17:43:07] <robertmaxrees> you need the value of the select itself.
[17:43:37] <robertmaxrees> and you want to use a data attribute for that genom
[17:43:41] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/92666/ like this.
[17:44:50] <ledtc> why ? its just more code
[17:46:50] <robertmaxrees> because they're *technically* not valid.  it might function, but it's generally frowned upon to use custom attributes.
[17:48:38] <ledtc> robertmaxrees, well ive understood that, i am getting some where https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/92690/
[17:50:33] <robertmaxrees> yeah so
[17:50:40] <robertmaxrees> var value = $( ".selectorPostOnUpdate option:selected" ).text(); you don't need this.
[17:50:54] <robertmaxrees> you can literally call .val() on $(this)
[17:51:41] <ledtc> ohhh
[17:51:56] <ledtc> i am forming a hate love relationship here
[17:52:22] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:54:28] <ledtc> robertmaxrees, i think i got something right, and its not.
[17:54:43] <robertmaxrees> that's just learning./
[17:58:12] <ledtc> hmm i need to catch this post aswell
[17:58:48] <robertmaxrees> "catch this post"?
[18:00:14] <ledtc> the Ajax post that i will be sending to the backend, i found a good exemple the flask documentation
[18:02:44] <robertmaxrees> ajax posts are easy.
[18:04:03] <ledtc> robertmaxrees, this part here data: $('form').serialize()   i need to change the $('form') part to my varibles, whats the correct syntax ?
[18:04:22] <ledtc> {name:data,name2:data2} ?
[18:04:28] <robertmaxrees> show your code :)
[18:05:58] <ledtc> https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/92785/
[18:14:26] <ledtc> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/92853/
[18:29:46] <robertmaxrees> ledtc you don't need to serialize that.
[18:30:00] <ledtc> i dont ?
[18:30:02] <robertmaxrees> you can literally just do https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/92934/
[18:30:33] <ledtc> ohh
[18:30:55] <ledtc> i did not find how to structure it before the serialisation
[18:31:04] <ledtc> How would i do normaly ?
[18:50:00] <Levin^> I'm having some trouble with an image
[18:50:08] <Levin^> http://lumo2017.provisorio.ws/site/pt/quem-somos/origem/
[18:50:39] <Levin^> please find this image on my page: http://lumo2017.provisorio.ws/site/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/origens-lumo.jpg
[18:51:20] <Levin^> I ned it to be bigger, but to reach all the gray background, from its actual position to the right side of the viewport
[18:51:42] <Levin^> for some reason I can't do it with css
[18:51:51] <Levin^> maybe with jquery it's possible
[18:52:11] <robertmaxrees> have you asked #css
[18:52:11] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:52:50] <Levin^> it's idle
[18:53:01] <Levin^> and I tried everything I could without success
[19:07:58] <robertmaxrees> Levin^ so what's wrong with it now?
[19:19:22] <Levin^> robertmaxrees: I need the image to resize accordingly to the window size, and to resize to touch the right edge of the screen, from its current position
[19:19:31] <Levin^> a rough example: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/oqVjKr
[19:21:21] <Levin^> (update it now, I change a little bit of the styling)
[19:21:32] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[19:21:43] <robertmaxrees> yeah, I'd just hang out in #css until they can help :)
[19:21:49] <Levin^> uh
[19:21:59] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:22:15] <Levin^> ok :)
[19:49:38] <lucas_ai> Anyone know how to make realtime video streaming that can be embedded in HTML or Iframes? Real time meaning less than 200ms delay. Similar to video conferencing found in facebook, skype, hangouts, etc.
[19:51:03] <robertmaxrees> lucas_ai could look into webrtc
[19:51:24] <lucas_ai> yes, but how do I make a server for it easily?
[19:51:41] <lucas_ai> also I can't find an easy way to publish webrtc from the terminal
[19:51:42] <robertmaxrees> https://www.pubnub.com/blog/2015-08-25-webrtc-video-chat-app-in-20-lines-of-javascript/
[19:52:13] <robertmaxrees> plenty of guides out there.
[20:02:11] <lucas_ai> that uses a private service
[20:02:49] <robertmaxrees> mind if I ask why you're looking for a self-hosted video chat solution?
[22:51:05] <devi8> I keep finding myself in need of contact information for various vendors or businesses or people and wondered if anyone uses a "contact" plugin to manage things like phone numbers, job titles, addresses, etc.
