[11:36:19] <enerel> i want to put in my website dark and light theme change button how to accomplish?
[11:37:59] <enerel> change css with jquery? but do not know how to do it
[11:41:10] <Uhkis> use classes for each theme and check out toggleClass
[11:42:01] <enerel> Uhkis how to do it? i created already dark.css and light.css
[11:43:02] <Uhkis> rebuild those to use classes instead of files
[11:45:16] <enerel> it will have many classes and long i thought file will be much efficient
[11:50:05] <Uhkis> hmm, maybe put all those rules under body .light {} and body .dark {} and your change theme button would be something like $('#themebutton').on('click', function() { $('body').toggleClass('dark'); });
[12:37:23] <enerel> guys i am loading content of datatable though ajax, but it does not show number of pages. how to initialise it after ajax load
[13:10:50] <z1haze> how would i write a selector that does this `$form.find(':input.required')` but also [name!$=residential] ? or something like that
[13:11:35] <z1haze> like $form.find(':input.required:not([name$=address])') ?
[13:15:37] <Uhkis> https://api.jquery.com/not/
[13:21:27] <z1haze> ? i already know how to use not as its in my example.. its just a bit of a confusing selector
[13:21:34] <z1haze> thanks though
[13:25:23] <Uhkis> where in your example is .not() used?
[13:25:49] <Uhkis> all i'm seeing is :not
[13:27:12] <z1haze> oh, you are right. but ultimately what i thought wouldnt work actually did work
[13:27:22] <z1haze> maybe its doing the same thing underneith
[13:27:31] <z1haze> underneath?
[22:27:28] <robertparkerx> https://termbin.com/n7ll it works for adding the class but not removing
[22:28:06] <robertparkerx> I'm not sure why
[22:28:27] <robertmaxrees> mind making an actual fiddle?
[22:30:37] <robertmaxrees> though fwiw, i'd get rid of that one-liner and just do it explicitly.
[22:31:40] <robertparkerx> https://jsfiddle.net/3c9840rm/1/
[22:33:54] <robertmaxrees> but also
[22:34:14] <robertmaxrees> your code is saying $caret.hasClass but is adding/removing from the icone.
[22:34:32] <robertparkerx> crap
[22:34:41] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/76L8q1e4/2/ ;)
[22:35:21] <robertparkerx> lol ty robertmaxrees
[22:35:46] <robertmaxrees> but ferreal - stuff like this is why I say to not try to use one-liners like this.  No real benefit and lots of downsides.
[22:39:00] <robertparkerx> I see your point
[22:52:00] <robertmaxrees> :)
