[00:00:11] <mfranz> sacho: are you talking to me
[00:00:30] <sacho> yes
[00:01:00] <mfranz> sacho: you want something on jsfiddle or how do you mean?
[00:01:25] <sacho> jsfiddle is a common way to present test cases, sure.
[00:01:39] <sacho> I mean, what do you honestly expect from the description you've given?
[00:02:21] <mfranz> sacho: I wasn't sure if that would be clear enough, let me get something together here
[00:02:32] <Andrew_R> mfranz: what do you mean by "I am sure it is that the DOM is getting loaded before the ajax is completed somehow"?
[00:03:55] <mfranz> http://jsfiddle.net/Wy8Jq/
[00:04:20] <mfranz> The (data) from the ajax call in firebug looks like this: <div data-role="collapsible" id="set1"><h3>2013-04-07 01:31:35 - Lap Colectomy - Total</h3></div>
[00:05:11] <mfranz> http://jsfiddle.net/Wy8Jq/2/
[00:05:15] <enerel> how to make collapsible by default open 1st?
[00:05:20] <mfranz> that is a better example as I added the framwork
[00:06:14] <mfranz> This issue is getting it to insert the ajax'd (data) as the div, if I statically define the div ---> as in the jsfiddle it works fine, but I can't seem to .append to the collapsible-set correctly
[00:06:52] <Andrew_R> mfranz: I stripped out all the ajax stuff from your code and just set data to the value you provided, it appears to work fine. http://jsfiddle.net/Wy8Jq/3/
[00:07:08] <Andrew_R> something else must be going on there
[00:07:21] <mfranz> exactly
[00:07:56] <mfranz> that is what I have been dealing with if I alert the success ajax data it prints this: <div data-role="collapsible" id="set1"><h3>2013-04-07 01:31:35 - Lap Colectomy - Total</h3></div>
[00:07:58] <mfranz> to the screen
[00:08:07] <mfranz> so it clearly is getting the correct data string back
[00:08:24] <mfranz> however the .append(data) must be the issue
[00:08:30] <mfranz> is that the wrong command to append to the set
[00:08:51] <mfranz> or since there isn't anything else there in the set initally should I be using something other than append>
[00:09:35] <Andrew_R> yeah, actually if you look at my updated fiddle, it put the set1 in the wrong location
[00:09:57] <Andrew_R> or at least it doesn't look right
[00:11:00] <mfranz> yeah
[00:11:03] <mfranz> so that is what I get
[00:11:26] <mfranz> well I don't get the first 'good' one, becuase I don't hard code the data, but what I am getting is the string but not formatted as a collapsible
[00:13:22] <mfranz> the .replaceWith also doesn't work
[00:13:47] <Andrew_R> it has something to do with this: http://api.jquerymobile.com/collapsible-set/#method-refresh
[00:14:21] <prologic> Hey all. Trying to get a simple jquery + jquery.terminal demo working but running into some weird issues: http://arrow.shortcircuit.net.au:81/ namely I keep getting "Error: INVALID_STATE_ERR: DOM Exception 11" in Chrome. Any ideas?
[00:15:13] <enerel> i want to open first collapsible but  data-collapsed="true" does not work
[00:15:15] <enerel> any idea?
[00:15:24] <enerel> by default
[00:15:57] <mfranz> shouldn't it be false if the method is data-collapsed
[00:16:16] <mfranz> I'm the collapsible content in a set so this feels like an accordion. I'm open by default because I have the data-collapsed="false" attribute.
[00:16:32] <mfranz> that is the example from http://api.jquerymobile.com/collapsible-set/
[00:16:33] <enerel> oops
[00:16:40] <mfranz> enerel: LAWLS!
[00:16:49] <enerel> thanks
[00:16:55] <mfranz> np
[00:18:06] <Andrew_R> mfranz: I tried adding $('#surgery_accord_set').collapsibleset( "refresh" ); to my fiddle, but it throws an error "cannot call methods on collapsibleset prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'refresh'"
[00:18:48] <mfranz> Andrew_R: do you think I need to use a .create?
[00:19:06] <Andrew_R> I was just looking at that
[00:19:14] <mfranz> yep
[00:19:21] <mfranz> http://jsfiddle.net/Wy8Jq/5/
[00:19:23] <mfranz> that seems to work
[00:19:27] <mfranz> Let me try the live code
[00:20:21] <mfranz> Andrew_R: Works like a charm
[00:20:43] <mfranz> Andrew_R: Wow that was about an hour wasted I really should look at those methods more closely, thanks for the help
[00:21:21] <enerel> why nested listview is depreciated from 1.3.0?
[00:21:57] <Andrew_R> in the live code, does the ajax happen right away?
[00:23:17] <mfranz> Andrew_R: Yep
[00:23:26] <Andrew_R> mfranz: http://jsfiddle.net/Wy8Jq/6/ this might be more reliable
[00:23:29] <mfranz> Andrew_R: Works great, appearently you have to tigger the event
[00:23:56] <Andrew_R> I don't know much about the inner workings of jqm though, so the way you are doing it might be fine
[00:24:23] <mfranz> Andrew_R: That looks a log cleaner though, thanks
[00:26:22] <enerel> JQM why child page is depreciated i like that feature? any other easy way?
[00:26:40] <enerel> in listview
[00:27:21] <mfranz> Andrew_R: Your way looks to be better, since if you navigate with the back/foward with my way it was re-appending the data multiple times, you way seems to clear the data.
[00:27:41] <mfranz> each time, so that it only shows once
[00:29:37] <Andrew_R> I'm sure there is something internal binding to that create event, and it should be triggered automatically when the page loads, so triggering it a second time is probably causing that behavior
[00:30:43] <mfranz> Andrew_R: Well it seems to work as expected, so that is pretty nice
[00:31:02] <Andrew_R> cool
[00:34:15] <enerel> can anyone tell me alternative on nested list it is depreciated now
[00:37:06] <Andrew_R> enerel: a new page containing the "nested" list?
[00:38:15] <enerel> Andrew_R: yes
[00:38:43] <enerel> do you suggest me to use different page for JQM or use multi-page feature?
[00:38:59] <enerel> all content on 1 html
[00:39:16] <enerel> creating a phonegap app
[00:39:59] <Andrew_R> it's up to you, but the multi-page feature might make it easier to manage, since of the sub pages would basically just be a <ul>
[00:42:40] <enerel> ok
[02:10:34] <catsrcute> hello, can someone help me with a newbie question regarding jQuery and JSON requests?
[02:18:04] <rgenito_> catsrcute, sure, what do you need help with? :)
[02:21:31] <catsrcute> regino_: ok so reading the documentation, the second argument to a $.getJSON call is a function that is called upon success. I'm just not sure about what happens to the JSON information after the $.getJSON call, or how to set up that function
[02:21:54] <catsrcute> oops sorry rgenito_ :p
[02:40:23] <krystianm> hi, if I load a template file like this: var tplFile = $.get("file.tpl", function(){}) how do i then get $('#template_part') from the tplFile varialble ?
[02:51:59] <buffi> If I have a doubleclick-event handler, what would the easiest way be to generate a serializable selector for the clicked item, so that i can find that object again later (subsequent visit)
[02:52:54] <buffi> or rather, i'd like to generate a selector for a specific dom object by clicking it. any utility methods for this?
[03:03:40] <enerel> is there any plugin for preloading JQM website for the first time?
[03:06:19] <enerel> is there any plugin for preloading JQM before loading website for the first time?
[03:14:44] <PapaSier_> i'm trying to figure out jshint. i'm using phpstorm. i have a namespace which is essentially just a variable declared in another file. it's telling me "Unresolved variable or type XYZ" and also "ABC is not defined" in other cases. i'm trying to use /* global ABC */ but it's having no effect
[03:35:26] <enerel> in JQM multi-page can i have subpage that also has sub pages? how can i achive that? nested pages
[03:52:52] <bluesm> Is there a tool that could tell me which version  (the earliest) of jQuery i could include to my Script to work ?
[03:54:44] <Whiskey> $("#infoViewLineLeft").css("padding-left", "10px"); <-- what wrong in that one try to add padding-left to infoViewLineLeft class

[05:31:30] <j3lte> That paste was for Wamer
[05:31:45] <enerel> on my above question
[05:33:54] <guardian> hello
[05:34:00] <enerel> hi
[05:35:33] <guardian> I'm trying to retrive css('background-position') on IE7. according to this bug: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10796 but it doesn't work with 1.9.1
[05:35:38] <guardian> any hint?
[06:06:49] <Tsd_> hi@all
[06:07:12] <Tsd_> do anybody know how to dynamicall create a dialog box in jqm
[06:07:32] <Tsd_> i have to generate the dialog box and open it via js
[06:25:01] <jackw411> guys im using an $.ajax request to populate an array from a json object: why does it only work when async is set to false? I don't understand: is it because my code gets executed on an async request before I've gotten the return from the server?
[06:25:54] <Tsd_> do you work with callbacks
[06:26:15] <Tsd_> if you work with async ajax request you don't get a value back
[06:26:26] <Tsd_> you have to catch the success callback
[06:26:32] <Tsd_> there you get your values
[06:39:18] <daslicht> how can i format the returned date into a "yyyy-mm-dd" string ?
[06:39:18] <daslicht> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#method-getDate
[06:41:13] <daslicht>  var currentDate = $( "#startdate" ).datepicker( "getDate" )
[06:41:13] <daslicht>                         var dateString = currentDate.toString('yyyy-MM-dd');
[06:41:20] <daslicht> seams to be not doing teh job
[06:44:40] <daslicht> even if i set the datformat ithe get date function always returns something like : Wed Apr 10 2013 00:00:00 GMT+0200 (CEST)
[06:48:15] <enerel> JQM: how can i put count bubble on nested listview?
[06:50:17] <jackw411> i have an object in my backbone models attributes - trying to get at it to construct html, however model.get('attrib.object.containedData') just returns undefined... how would i do this?
[06:51:14] <fris> daslicht why not use new Date()
[06:51:36] <daslicht> hm
[06:51:44] <daslicht> can i create a ndew date from an existing ?
[06:52:02] <fris> http://www.kelvinluck.com/assets/jquery/datePicker/v2/demo/datePickerDefaultToday.html here is an example using the todays date (diff datepicker though)
[06:52:09] <daslicht> I have solved it now by using the altField
[06:52:27] <daslicht> even more convenient than manually setting the updates :)
[06:52:51] <Tsd_> @daslicht maybe http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-dateFormat
[06:53:02] <fris> var Today = new Date().asString();
[06:53:11] <daslicht> that do not affect the getDate() output
[06:53:40] <daslicht> nevermind , i have used now the altField
[06:53:54] <daslicht> i didnt knew that there is that function :)
[06:54:12] <fris> daslicht for future refernce also look at the diff date methods jquery has https://raw.github.com/vitch/jquery-methods/master/date.js
[06:54:20] <daslicht> now i need to find out if the calendar date is today
[06:54:26] <daslicht> thank you very much !
[06:54:37] <daslicht> whats the best approch to solve this ?
[06:54:46] <daslicht> *bookmarked*
[06:54:59] <Tsd_> @enerel nested lists doesn't support count bubbles
[06:55:08] <fris> i would use the Date() functions
[06:55:28] <fris> are you using a datepicker along with php? or is it js only?
[06:55:39] <enerel> Is there a way to center the text for the collapsibles?
[06:56:35] <daslicht> ok cool
[06:57:16] <enerel> Tsd_: i found solution to show count bubbles in nestedlist you have to type <span> around title and it works
[06:57:31] <Tsd_> oh ok
[06:57:36] <Tsd_> i never tried it
[06:57:39] <enerel> Is there a way to center the text for the collapsibles? not all just one
[06:57:50] <Tsd_> but i read it in some boards
[06:58:20] <enerel> yes i also find it in board
[06:58:48] <enerel> 1 year ago, still no fix for that maybe thats how JQM designed to work
[06:59:08] <fris> daslicht from my experience all the datepickers start off on the current day
[06:59:25] <fris> http://stefangabos.ro/jquery/zebra-datepicker/ this is the one i use
[06:59:56] <daslicht> i liek to find out if its set to the current day , and if so write submit NULL
[07:00:13] <fris> daslicht also if you wanted to add time to your datepicker http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/ this is an addon which integrates time as well
[07:01:45] <daslicht> can you disable the highlight of the current date in the jqueryUI date picker?
[07:02:45] <daslicht> I have 2 datepickers here, to enter events, the second is optional showable if the event lasts over more days
[07:03:16] <daslicht> now i like to write NULL for teh enddate if its set the current day
[07:03:29] <daslicht> this way i could hide it when you edit the event
[07:06:35] <fris> probably on click or on focus of the text field probably?
[07:10:00] <daslicht> still struggeling to compare the dates
[07:10:10] <daslicht> i have now 2 date objects
[07:10:19] <daslicht> but how to properly compare them
[07:11:31] <daslicht> enddate == enddate
[07:11:35] <daslicht> this always returns true
[07:11:58] <daslicht> ahh i see
[07:13:29] <daslicht> what a mess
[07:16:33] <daslicht> solve d:)
[07:16:47] <scar> Does anyone have experinece with JWPlayer? I'm loading a smil file just fine, but breaks on any mobile- even android. all my files are mp4s as well.
[07:17:09] <fris> scar i do
[07:17:28] <jackw411> in backbone - say i have a model that has lots of data to construct html in - do i construct the html in the view based on the model data? I'm a bit lost
[07:17:40] <scar> fris, nice. do you know vs mobile vs desktop? i understand many ipod,pad, etc issues with the file type being flash, but this is not the case
[07:18:44] <scar> Error loading player: No playable sources foun
[07:19:29] <enerel> on nested listview how can i show footer
[07:20:13] <fris> scar are you including multiple sources in html5 ?
[07:20:25] <fris> they have to be in the proper order as well
[07:20:53] <scar> it's using a SMIL file, want to see the smil file?
[07:20:58] <scar> and the embed js?
[07:21:21] <fris> whats is a smil file/
[07:21:38] <fris> like a playlist?
[07:21:58] <scar> yeah here: http://pastebin.com/8uSYipky
[07:22:01] <scar> and here's the embed:
[07:22:51] <scar> http://pastebin.com/bXxqzmtg
[07:23:08] <scar> fris, the 2 urls that are php vars--- here's an example of ones that output:
[07:23:23] <fris> scar you do know theres a wp plugin for jw player?
[07:25:40] <scar> yeah but not sure how that could help me at this juncture lol
[07:26:01] <scar> its weird bc it doesnt work on any mobile
[07:30:08] <saltcod> Hey all — how do I reference an object's method in another method?
[07:30:10] <saltcod> https://gist.github.com/saltcod/5330717
[07:30:48] <scar> fris,  any idea? heh
[07:35:28] <saebekassebil> saltcod: Give your function expressions names
[07:36:03] <saltcod> saebekassebil: not quite sure what you mean
[07:36:15] <guardian> what could be the reason? I'm getting back 'background-position-x' on IE8, then I set it to the value I just got. and the background gets shifted to the right
[07:37:00] <fris> scar i usally do the video elements with the regular mp4 first then the others as fallbacks
[07:37:24] <scar> so no smil?
[07:37:33] <fris> what is a smil file?
[07:37:38] <fris> never heard of it
[07:37:41] <scar> my first paste
[07:38:00] <saebekassebil> saltcod: An easier way to do it would be to just call `this.hideIt()`
[07:38:15] <fris> no i would just do the elements, never heard of anyone doing a smil file
[07:38:42] <rindolf> Hi all.
[07:38:44] <fris> i myself use sublime video for html5 which works nicely with mobile
[07:38:47] <saebekassebil> saltcod: https://gist.github.com/saltcod/5330717
[07:39:19] <scar> so i should drop the files into jplayer playlist rather than smil?
[07:39:40] <fris> jplayer isnt jwplayer
[07:39:58] <fris> you dont need a plylist if its just for 1 video with multiple formats
[07:40:52] <scar> i meant to say jwplayer
[07:40:53] <scar> lol
[07:41:21] <saltcod> saebekassebil: It's actually inside a pile of tested callbacks.  It doesn't seem to know that 'this' is by the end https://gist.github.com/saltcod/5330717
[07:41:22] <scar> it's all the same .mp4 format, just different sizes it appears
[07:41:34] <fris> the jwplayer has a visual button that let you select the formats, with mobile, etc
[07:41:43] <fris> (wp plugin)
[07:41:57] <fris> you should really be speaking about this in #wordpress
[07:41:58] <saltcod> saebekassebil: calling  this.biograghyMenuItemShow(); gives >  Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'biograghyMenuItemShow'
[07:42:29] <scar> fris, why does it have to be in wordpress?
[07:42:30] <saltcod> saebekassebil: Sorry it's in such a mess — I'm still learning!
[07:42:46] <fris> scar by the code you showed its wordpress by getting custom fields
[07:43:15] <scar> fris, true, but i grabbed it from the blog. this is implemented elsewhere outside of WP
[07:43:22] <scar> my fault i didnt even realize the wp function haha
[07:46:08] <saebekassebil> saltcod: np. What object are you calling this method of yours on?
[07:46:37] <saltcod> saebekassebil: the Hidey object
[07:47:25] <saltcod> saebekassebil: I'm looking to sequentially fade and animate elements on page load — using mostly callbacks on fadeIn()
[07:48:26] <saebekassebil> saltcod: Yes, I just noticed your code. You're building up towards what it called "the pyramid of doom", so many callbacks, will get hard to maintain. Just a moment
[07:49:41] <saltcod> saebekassebil: "the pyramid of doom" !!    HA!   I definitely know this isn't a good idea — hence I was trying to separate  all those callbacks into their own methods and call them sequentially
[07:52:30] <saebekassebil> saltcod: You could just call "Hidey.biograghyMenuItemShow"
[07:52:37] <saebekassebil> instead of this.biograghyMenuItemShow
[07:53:18] <saltcod> saebekassebil:  tried that too. It gives me:  Uncaught ReferenceError: biograghyMenuItem is not defined
[07:53:32] <sunbeam> Is there a way using jquery validate() to check password fields (eg they are the same value)
[07:54:18] <saebekassebil> That's because it isn't :) in biograghyMenuItemShow() you should call: Hidey.biograghyMenuItem.css (...)
[07:55:58] <saebekassebil> saltcod: Works?
[07:56:57] <saltcod> saebekassebil: but I have biograghyMenuItem defined up top with my other cached elements
[07:57:23] <saebekassebil> Not here: https://gist.github.com/saltcod/5330717
[07:57:32] <saebekassebil> There it's a member of the Hidey object
[07:57:46] <saebekassebil> not a global
[07:58:42] <saltcod> saebekassebil: Oh. I thought I could use that like a variable in that object
[07:59:29] <saebekassebil> saltcod: Well if the scope is right, you can write "this.member", but in general it's because the variable is scoped to the Hidey object, and not the global scope
[07:59:53] <saltcod> saebekassebil:  aah. I got it.
[08:00:13] <saltcod> I was calling biograghyMenuItemShow to do something with biograghyMenuItem
[08:00:32] <saltcod> but it didn't know what the biograghyMenuItem element was
[08:00:58] <saltcod> saebekassebil: calling Hidey.biograghyMenuItem did the trick
[08:01:02] <saebekassebil> exactly. Because "biograghyMenuItem" wasn't defined in that scope
[08:01:04] <saebekassebil> great
[08:01:11] <saltcod> awesome
[08:01:18] <saebekassebil> but you should look at some patterns to reduce the depth of those animations :P

[08:04:30] <sunbeam> Is there a way using jquery validate() to check password fields (eg they are the same value)
[08:12:55] <lemarc> i am trying to give easing to animate function in jquery but i keep getting the error that "Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'easeInElastic', heres my code: http://pastebin.com/44WDhm5c
[08:13:25] <gnarf> lemarc: did you load jQuery.easing plugin / or jQuery UI effects core?
[08:13:34] <gnarf> without one of those two, there is only "swing" and "linear"
[08:13:58] <lemarc> i have included easing plugin in my html
[08:14:08] <lemarc> heres my code http://pastebin.com/44WDhm5c
[08:14:26] <gnarf> can you link me to jquery.easing.compatibility.js ?
[08:16:19] <gnarf> seems that he defined it as "elasin" http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/jquery.easing.compatibility.js
[08:17:43] <gnarf> lemarc: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.effect.js#L1236-L1287 if you want the jQuery UI named ones -- this is the "easing" plugin we have in effects core
[08:19:38] <lemarc> gnarf, i tried "elasin", the error m getting is Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'easeInElastic' in jquery.easing.compatibility.js
[08:20:15] <gnarf> lemarc: why is it erroring about 'easeInElastic' if you changed it to 'elasin' ?
[08:20:38] <gnarf> oh
[08:20:39] <gnarf> cuz
[08:20:46] <gnarf> compat isn't the actual plugin lemarc
[08:20:54] <lemarc> it says no easeInElastic in jquery.easing.compatibility.js in line 41
[08:21:10] <lemarc> but my code has just 23 lines
[08:21:10] <gnarf> yeah, its aliases
[08:21:16] <gnarf> that plugin doesn
[08:21:23] <gnarf> 't actually define the easings
[08:21:32] <gnarf> copy the chunk of UI code I just linked you at on github
[08:21:41] <lemarc> sure, i will try that
[08:21:48] <gnarf> thats the smallest easing lib after compression i know of at the moment
[08:28:08] <ladislaw> can you remove a parent element without removing the child?
[08:28:20] <sunbeam> I want to check whether an input.password field is empty and if it is, a certain class should be removed, if not it should be added..
[08:28:24] <sunbeam> how can I best do this?
[08:28:56] <sunbeam> i need to check this realtime
[08:29:01] <enerel> using JQM i cannot see search icon i have the icon images http://kefelon.com/phonegap/#lyrics
[08:29:02] <sunbeam> so as soon as someone fills in 1 character
[08:29:04] <enerel> any idea?
[08:30:25] <netraameht> Hello?
[08:30:39] <sunbeam> nvm
[08:32:08] <no_gravity> Hello Everybody! When starting a new little Web-App how would you start out? Use some JS-Framework, jquery or something - or just go with plain javascript? Right now I need to implement a little "Thank you, new entry saved" when a user inputs data. So i think "should i implement my own little popup or use something open source?"
[08:32:29] <gnarf> sunbeam: $("input.password").on("input keyup keypress paste", function() { $(this).toggleClass( "empty", this.value.length == 0 ) });
[08:33:39] <sunbeam> thanks
[08:34:26] <enerel> gnarf: can you see my icon issue
[08:36:01] <sacho> no_gravity, it depends
[08:36:03] <rk88> can anyone help me figuring out how to solve this problem? Thanks in advance! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15862692/touchstart-event-stops-working-after-scroll/15863042?noredirect=1#comment22578876_15863042
[08:36:12] <gnarf> enerel: not sure there, i recall someone else having a similar issue though I don't remember the solution
[08:36:34] <enerel> i see
[08:37:27] <sacho> no_gravity, although to tl;dr what I was going to write you, just use what you're comfortable with - for example, I like using jquery for dom interaction since it's familiar and quick to write for me
[08:37:50] <sacho> no_gravity, sometimes it's worth exploring new libraries, but it depends on the time you have to complete a task
[08:40:32] <no_gravity> sacho: thanks
[08:41:48] <okdamn> how do i get the 20% width of the window?
[08:41:50] <okdamn> in px
[08:42:42] <rk88> viewPort.x * 20 / 100
[08:42:49] <gnarf> okdamn: why?
[08:43:02] <gnarf> okdamn: can you just use CSS width: 20% ?
[08:43:07] <rk88> or whatever variable you assigned to the viewport
[08:43:07] <netraameht> Hey, does anyone know why http://prntscr.com/zlzyd and http://prntscr.com/zm08w aren't working? Thanks :3
[08:43:16] <gnarf> on your element, doing it in JS is kinda silly
[08:43:50] <machty> is there a function that accepts the same hash params as .css() but generates a style string instead? such as cssStyle({ position: "absolute" }) === "position: absolute" ?
[08:44:00] <okdamn> gnarf:  dinamically adding css
[08:46:52] <rk88> it appears that touchstart events applied to a fixed positioned div, stop working after scrolling the amount of the fixed div's height. any ideas why and how to fix this?
[08:47:32] <gnarf> okdamn: sounds like a bad idea
[08:47:41] <okdamn> uhm right
[08:47:51] <okdamn> but it seems it doesn't takes right; and left; rules
[08:47:55] <okdamn> it is position:absolute
[08:48:05] <okdamn> and when using fadeIn() it sets display:block;
[08:48:05] <gnarf> `demo
[08:48:05] <b-ot> gnarf: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:48:06] <gnarf> ?
[08:48:08] <okdamn> i think it' s a problem
[08:48:29] <gnarf> okdamn: you realize you can do all that with just regular CSS yeah, including the fadeIn ?
[08:49:20] <okdamn> uhm no cause it's on click fadeIn
[08:50:05] <rk88> it appears that touchstart events applied to a fixed positioned div, stop working after scrolling the amount of the fixed div's height. any ideas why and how to fix this? example can be found here (only on mobile) -> www.dokidok.im
[08:50:35] <okdamn> ok i found problem
[08:50:37] <okdamn> fixed
[08:50:38] <okdamn> thanks
[08:51:42] <gnarf> sigh
[08:51:48] <gnarf> why don't people listen... oh well
[08:52:24] <rk88> gnarf, can you have a look at my problem..?
[08:52:35] <rk88> i'm litteraly smashing my keybd
[08:53:03] <gnarf> rk88: all i know is that fixed + mobile = errmaghad
[08:53:12] <gnarf> cc arschmitz
[08:53:25] <rk88> grarf I agree but.... how to footer, then??
[08:53:43] <gnarf> rk88: I'm not entirely sure how jQuery mobile does it, but i know arschmitz is
[08:55:31] <gnarf> rk88: like every mobile browser has a different bug with fixed
[08:56:18] <rk88> gnarf I know... there used to be a pretty bad one on ios, but it seems it's been fixed
[08:58:13] <gnarf> arschmitz: you should write an article about fixed + mobile
[09:15:56] <ladislaw> given the following element <div class="one two"></div> will this be the correct way to select these elements? $('.one .two').contents();

[09:22:55] <wunnle> Hello.
[09:23:45] <wunnle> How can i check if a div is in the visible part of page? I have a navigation menu which scrolls to divs and I want to check if divs are active.
[09:24:23] <ladislaw> can you pass multiple elements to contents() e.g. var contents = $('.nav-collapse,.collapse').contents();
[09:24:55] <rindolf> ladislaw: do you want it to return an array?
[09:25:04] <rindolf> ladislaw: did you try it in Firebug or whatever?
[09:25:48] <ladislaw> rindolf: This is what i am trying to do (similar) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/170004/how-to-remove-only-the-parent-element-and-not-its-child-elements-in-javascript
[09:28:23] <rindolf> ladislaw: you can assign the return of $(...) to a variable and iterate on it.
[09:35:14] <enerel> guys need your advice, my first time doing JQM. how can i do genre nesting

[09:37:47] <enerel> http://kefelon.com/phonegap/#lyrics how can i show header and footers on nested listview
[09:38:52] <systemfault> I'd do something like myElement.parent().append(myElement.children()).remove(); Not sure id it works though.
[09:40:32] <ladislaw> i need something that works
[09:40:54] <ladislaw> keep in mind i have to elements in the parent div "one" and "two"
[09:40:57] <ladislaw> 2*
[09:41:32] <wunnle> hello
[09:41:59] <wunnle> How can I check if a div is currently in active part of browser?
[09:42:52] <systemfault> ladislaw: Have you tried it?
[09:43:39] <ladislaw> systemfault: I have many child elements
[09:43:52] <ladislaw> pastebin just contains 2
[09:44:44] <ladislaw> to select every child in the way you suggest seems clumsy
[09:44:57] <rindolf> ladislaw: use a loop.
[09:45:51] <ladislaw> what is child have children too?
[09:45:57] <ladislaw> will it work?
[09:46:01] <ladislaw> if*

[10:48:50] <peeeeter> can someone recommend me a good jquery UI guide/tutorial/book? I mainly need stuff like transitions
[10:55:41] <redmaverick_>  Hi Guys quick question. I have three pieces of data [from address for email, to address for email, url] Should I create a json object and send it to server or send these pieces directly from the chrome extension? What is the best practice here?
[12:01:08] <Foxhoundz> what do you mean, "directly from the chrome extension"
[12:01:14] <Foxhoundz> rephrase it
[12:15:28] <peeeeter> can someone recommend me a good jquery UI guide/tutorial/book? I mainly need stuff like transitions (fading button states, animating overlay pop-ups and stuff).
[12:26:52] <Scorpin> hi
[12:27:27] <Scorpin> im trying to modify a jquery plugin but it was been more hard than i think..
[12:28:21] <Foxhoundz> peeeeter: I suggest you go over DOM tutorials more so than jQuery
[12:28:24] <Scorpin> how can i store vars in .data, to read them from another method of the same plugin?
[12:28:31] <Foxhoundz> if you understand the DOM, jquery should be very, very simple to learn
[12:29:31] <peeeeter> Foxhoundz, ok, sounds good :). One further thing though: I need to learn a bunch of the stuff faaaaast :) got to demonstrate my skills for a job. But I'll have a look at DOM stuff. thank you
[12:30:05] <Foxhoundz> I have a book lying around my bookshelf somewhere
[12:30:12] <Foxhoundz> I used it as I was learning jQuery as well
[12:30:14] <Foxhoundz> let me find the title

[12:42:48] <jacobsevart> Hello. I have a newbie question. I'm building a drag-and-drop matching quiz in jQuery and jQuery-UI… I've successfully got the "drop" event POSTing the server to check the answer, but it appears that in the ajax callback I only have access to ui.draggable (which I remove() on a correct answer. How do I remove() the droppable item? I can't figure out how to reference it from inside the ajax callback
[12:43:07] <heldndd> is there any reason why this wouldn't work:
[12:43:07] <heldndd> $("#form_toggler").click(function()
[12:43:19] <heldndd> i have an anchor tag with id form_toggler
[12:43:37] <heldndd> and typing $("#form_toggler") in console does work
[12:43:57] <Cracker2> anyone used BlockUI plugin? when i'm calling $.blockUI(); nothing happens. If i do setTimeout($.blockUI, 0); then it works. Why?
[12:45:06] <cramrod> heldndd, you should make a jsfiddle or something.  That one line alone probably isnt going to cut it.
[12:47:51] <jacobsevart> nvm I got it
[12:48:46] <lyrae> how can i use html5's data- attribute in a selector? something like $('ul.pages-thumbs li data[campaign_id=-1]').hide()
[12:50:38] <cramrod> Lyrae, what exactly are you trying to do?  Grab the value of the data attribute?
[12:50:42] <tw2113> ?data @ lyrae
[12:50:43] <bot-t> lyrae, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/

[12:52:16] <heldndd> or anyone else. i actually want to toggle something but currently it shows (or should) an alert instead
[12:53:05] <heldndd> i was missing );
[12:53:09] <heldndd> this is embrassing
[12:53:10] <heldndd> sorry
[12:54:23] <cramrod> ha.  It happens
[12:55:13] <cramrod> Lyrae, Have you tried a loop combined with jqueries .attr() ?
[13:51:20] <lyrae> no
[13:51:51] <lyrae> but if i can do $('li.foo').hide(), why can't i use data instead of a class
[13:54:39] <Gmac_> i have a stupid plugin that adds inline styles

[14:22:40] <^^jfc^^> hello there. I've implemented a vertical accordion wich I like to be expanded in an specific element (the one with "open" class) when linked from an external link. But when the page loads after the external link, all the elements are expanded http://pastebin.com/RY9hXgU0
[14:23:03] <^^jfc^^> how can I achieve to expand only the element with "open" class?
[14:24:10] <jackw411> ^^jfc^^ onclick do a toggle() or something
[14:25:28] <^^jfc^^> jackw411 thanks, I am able to expand the elements with a hover effect, but I want, that when the page loads from a "main" page with different links, the accordion expands with the element linked from the main page
[14:25:43] <^^jfc^^> the way I have to select the element linked, is by adding a "open" class

[16:45:49] <Brombomb> click only capture DOM elements on the page at the time of declaration
[16:45:55] <Brombomb> you want to use the .on method
[16:45:58] <Brombomb> !.on
[16:46:22] <Brombomb> ?on
[16:46:23] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/

[17:20:55] <raj> it's starting to get really messy
[17:21:20] <raj> I need a structured way to decide what goes in a new file and what goes in each "controller" function
[17:22:04] <coldhead> i use <script src="massiveconcatenatedminified.js">
[17:22:09] <coldhead> and get on with my life
[17:22:13] <Brombomb> Can you turn any of your code into a reusable plugin/widget?  Can you separate logic from presentation?
[17:22:19] <coldhead> but cool guys use AMD or  require.js
[17:22:29] <coldhead> you seem like a cool guy, raj, you should check those out
[17:22:42] <Brombomb> My company uses a form of MVC
[17:22:55] <Brombomb> plus our own built logical separation
[17:23:08] <Brombomb> but in the end we miniize and concat
[17:23:16] <raj> Brombomb, I try to keep eventhandlers and rendering stuff separate
[17:23:47] <raj> i'll eventually go to mvc
[17:23:57] <Brombomb> 1.1MB of miniized concatted js
[17:24:05] <raj> but in the mean time, I need to finish what I'm doing before I can implement a major chang elike that

[19:24:26] <abjorn> 3 hours, coldhead
[19:24:27] <abjorn> 3
[19:24:28] <abjorn> HOURS
[19:24:30] <abjorn> to get home that one day
[19:24:31] <raj> can't believe someone would tweet otherwise
[19:24:35] <abjorn> 19 miles, 3 hours
[19:24:44] <raj> if i had an account i'd def give them a piece of my mind
[19:24:48] <coldhead> dude, i felt like i was spending 3 hours of MY life just reading about it
[19:24:54] <abjorn> GOOD
[19:25:01] <coldhead> IT WAS NOT GOOD
[19:25:05] <coldhead> IT HAS AGED ME TERRIBLY
[19:25:22] <coldhead> i visited my MOTHER in hospital and the nurses thought I WAS HER GRANDFATHER
[19:25:23] <tw2113> i heard coldhead was like that guy in Indiana Jones and the Last Cruisade
[19:25:28] <abjorn> i was 22 when i went into that traffic jam
[19:25:29] <tw2113> the one protecting the cup
[19:25:31] <coldhead> hahahah
[19:25:32] <abjorn> i came out 40 years old
[19:25:56] <abjorn> little di dthe nurses know
[19:25:59] <coldhead> you better move bro, you can only age 18 years in a day so many more times
[19:26:03] <raj> abjorn, how can I organize my code without an MVC framework or require.js? like in the old days
[19:26:04] <abjorn> of the curious case of benjamin coldhead
[19:26:17] <tw2113> the old days were hell for js
[19:26:21] <abjorn> require.js is neato
[19:26:23] <tw2113> these kids are spoiled
[19:26:36] <abjorn> flight is p nice tho
[19:26:39] <abjorn> component-based framework
[19:26:52] <abjorn> more of a microframework but ya
[19:27:06] <raj> but I am not able to implement anything like that in my current state
[19:27:08] <tw2113> i heard the Crockford became his own standards body with JSON back when no one wanted to touch javascript
[19:27:13] <raj> need a few days to finish what i'm working on
[19:27:19] <jackw411> raj google pub/sub pattern if you don't want full blown mvc
[19:27:26] <raj> but in the meantime, my code is getting jumbly and i'm creating new functions
[19:27:34] <abjorn> pub/sub + components + require.js = cool shit
[19:27:39] <raj> and i want to at least organize them in a methodical fashion
[19:27:50] <raj> how did people do this before requirejs?
[19:27:54] <jackw411> abjorn: i agree, modular is awesome
[19:28:04] <raj> jackw411, what's that?
[19:28:11] <tw2113> did they do it before requirejs?
[19:28:18] <coldhead> raj: just include the files in alphabetical order
[19:28:18] <jackw411> require.js
[19:28:24] <abjorn> rofl alphabetical
[19:28:31] <coldhead> asciibetical even
[19:28:37] <abjorn> o u
[19:28:45] <tw2113> include the files in order of origin date suborganized by alphabet if from the same year
[19:29:11] <abjorn> dewey decimal system
[19:29:11] <tw2113> come on people, lets not get messy here
[19:29:19] <jackw411> tw2113: I heard the best method was to get all of your plugins into one file
[19:29:22] <raj> he's such a troublemaker
[19:29:24] <raj> i swear
[19:29:33] <raj> :)
[19:29:37] <raj> how did he get a bot?
[19:30:01] <abjorn> idk before i started using AMD I just included files in order of what was needed and had a build script to concat them
[19:30:07] <tw2113> optimization myth jackw411
[19:30:12] <abjorn> which, if you're using amd you should probs be doing that anyways
[19:30:17] <tw2113> each character should get their own js fie
[19:30:18] <abjorn> with like r.js or something
[19:30:20] <tw2113> file*
[19:30:35] <abjorn> 1 HTTP request per byte
[19:30:38] <raj> so first I have a render() and eventhandler() function
[19:30:42] <raj> render runs first, sets shit up
[19:31:02] <raj> then eventhandler contains all the  .on('bla',..,)
[19:31:14] <raj> but there are different parts of the page
[19:31:23] <raj> like menu area, content area
[19:31:30] <raj> so each of those should have a render/eventhandler func
[19:31:44] <abjorn> thats what im saying bro, components
[19:31:48] <raj> and then one controller should contain all the different areas of the page
[19:31:51] <jackw411> raj just use this: https://github.com/gfranko/Backbone-Require-Boilerplate
[19:31:52] <abjorn> http://twitter.github.io/flight/
[19:31:58] <raj> jackw411, i can't
[19:32:06] <abjorn> ive been wholly unsatisfied with backbone
[19:32:11] <raj> i need a preliminary way to organize before i implement angular.js
[19:32:13] <abjorn> a framework shouldn't require a boilerplate
[19:32:23] <abjorn> then it's..like...not a framework
[19:32:26] <raj> because i can't implement angular yet
[19:32:35] <abjorn> y is taht
[19:32:36] <abjorn> *that
[19:32:45] <abjorn> buddy wtf r u doin
[19:32:52] <raj> because things are in a little dissarray until I fix a couple things
[19:33:03] <abjorn> should be doing it the right way from the start
[19:33:04] <raj> to fix those things, I have to kinda abstract some functions
[19:33:19] <raj> in trying to abstract, i've come to realize i need a better way to organize
[19:33:26] <raj> thanks captain
[19:33:44] <abjorn> i require
[19:33:46] <abjorn> sustenance
[19:34:04] <abjorn> oh wait my roommate ordered pizza earlier i bet theres leftovers
[19:34:49] <raj> can someone give me an answer
[19:34:57] <raj> i'm really in need of an organization lesson
[19:35:42] <jackw411> i can teach you to keep everything at right angles on your desk
[19:35:52] <jackw411> but not much else
[19:36:47] <tw2113> hey coldhead you've seen They Live, right?
[19:36:56] <kakarlus> hi i have a problem with jquery.find()
[19:37:46] <raj> kakarlus, did it sleep with your gf?
[19:37:56] <coldhead> i don't believe so tw2113
[19:38:02] <coldhead> raj: not cool
[19:38:14] <tw2113> shame. you won't get what i had to say then, if you haven't seen it
[19:38:24] <kakarlus> raj koothrapali?
[19:38:37] <raj> precisely
[19:38:41] <kakarlus> nope it didn't
[19:38:57] <kakarlus> i thought it slept with your mom in india
[19:39:00] <raj> did you slap fight?
[19:39:14] <raj> kakarlus, my mom's a virgin
[19:39:40] <kakarlus> but every woman in india get raped at least 5 times right?
[19:39:42] <tw2113> alighty
[19:39:48] <raj> kakarlus, only bus-takers
[19:39:52] <tw2113> this escalated quickly
[19:39:57] <kakarlus> that includes your mom
[19:39:59] <raj> my mom rides a bike
[19:40:34] <kakarlus> but when its a long bike ride she takes the bike on a bus ride too
[19:40:48] <raj> no, she prefers the bumpy bike ride
[19:42:18] <kakarlus> oh so the bike fucked her so shes no virgin
[19:45:16] <raj> there's still a bike seat
[19:48:46] <kakarlus> but there's blood on the bike seat
[19:49:21] <raj> kakarlus, that's from the previous rape
[19:49:27] <coldhead> jesus, you people
[19:49:29] <raj> on the previous owner
[19:49:36] * tw2113 goes legit
[19:50:06] <coldhead> you can continue your fascinating discussion in private
[19:50:10] <coldhead> you massive cunts
[20:09:25] <innociv> !ticker
[20:20:44] <rayfinkle> is there a way to get the sizzle selector for a given node from the node itself?
[20:20:56] <rayfinkle> i.e. reverse the selection process
[20:23:14] <coldhead> nope
[21:02:36] <enthrops> Is there a good tutorial on jQuery somewhere? I've looked at official docs at the main website, but it's more like reference
[21:06:02] <pmcgovern> I have an anchor tag with a class of 'addToFavorites' and this is not being activated: $(\"a.addToFavorites\").click(function() {. Us this something obvious or do you guys need full code?
[21:15:35] <pmcgovern> I've tried numerous configurations, verified spelling, verified the code is in place… I don't understand why it's not being triggered
[21:24:05] <pmcgovern> I have a js fiddle of it here: http://jsfiddle.net/eLdxL/
[21:40:20] <pmcgovern> I tried switching to the .ajax function within the click handler, but it still seems to not be activated upon clicking the anchor: http://jsfiddle.net/eLdxL/5/
[21:40:26] <pmcgovern> anyone?
[21:41:19] <coldhead> pmcgovern: http://jsfiddle.net/eLdxL/6/
[21:41:27] <coldhead> you're missing the function keyword and the ()
[21:42:06] * pmcgovern facepalms
[21:42:30] <coldhead> aw i think your way is nicer
[21:42:36] <coldhead> it's just that JS doesn't understand
[21:42:47] <coldhead> i hate having to type "function ()" every 30 seconds
[21:42:50] <coldhead> every day forever
[21:43:26] <pmcgovern> neither of the alerts are being activated
[21:44:22] <pmcgovern> either the .done or the .fail alert should be called if the function is being run
[21:44:25] <pmcgovern> tneither are
[21:44:39] <pmcgovern> for some reason, that js code is not being called when the anchor is clicked
[21:44:58] <coldhead> it works for me when i add the jQuery library from the menu at right http://jsfiddle.net/eLdxL/7/
[21:45:01] <coldhead> i get the fail alert
[21:45:03] <coldhead> which is expected
[21:56:06] <k_sze[work]> What is the absolute minimum that I need to add to my page if I want to use jQuery UI's datepicker just to do date validation (the parseDate() function)?
[21:56:33] <k_sze[work]> instead of loading the whole jquery-ui.min.js, e.g.
[21:58:26] <coldhead> k_sze[work]: never tried it myself but can you use the custom builder and exclude everything but the datepicler?
[21:59:00] <pmcgovern> it works in the fiddle, but not on the site with the rest of the code
[21:59:08] <pmcgovern> no errors are generated in the console
[21:59:21] <pmcgovern> and the server I'm working on is behind a vpn so I can't share it
[22:00:10] <k_sze[work]> coldhead: right. I completely forgot about the custom builder. Thanks . :)
[22:00:58] <coldhead> pmcgovern: do you see the AJAX request take place in the network tab of web inspector/firebug?
[22:03:15] <pmcgovern> no
[22:03:34] <pmcgovern> here - this is a nasty dump of all the html, but the expected bahavior is as broken as it is on the site
[22:03:36] <pmcgovern> http://jsfiddle.net/KV2eK/
[22:04:38] <pmcgovern> i brought the functionality of the addToFavorites click function to a simple alert
[22:04:46] <pmcgovern> it's not being activated
[22:04:57] <pmcgovern> something else is conflicting and I'm not seeing what
[22:06:08] <coldhead> that's no use because raty is not included so your entire JS block is ignored: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'raty'
[22:06:34] <coldhead> pmcgovern: try console.log( $.fn.jquery )
[22:06:40] <coldhead> to ensure jquery is still the $
[22:06:47] <coldhead> you should see the version number
[22:07:34] <coldhead> alert('Fucking Hell!');
[22:07:35] <coldhead> lol
[22:07:52] <coldhead> also try verifying that your selectors are correct by running them from the console
[22:08:29] <coldhead> and finally try http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 to learn how to use the debugger and step through to see where it's falling over
[22:10:57] <pmcgovern> version number is not being written to console - I think anothe js error (that I though was harmless) is stopping everything else - I;m going to work on that
[22:11:56] <coldhead> there are no harmless errors
[22:15:04] <pmcgovern> I just upgraded colorbox to the latest release and voila
[22:15:08] <pmcgovern> fucking hell
[22:15:10] <pmcgovern> lol
[22:15:18] <coldhead> you have a lot of scripts there, pmcgovern
[22:15:28] <coldhead> you're lucky it was so easily fixed :D
[22:15:44] <coldhead> help yourself to a celebratory beer
[22:15:45] <pmcgovern> indeed
[22:15:59] <pmcgovern> nah - I'm on mocha frappuccinos tonight to stay awake
[22:16:07] <pmcgovern> thanks, though :)
[22:16:23] <coldhead> classy beverage!
[22:18:53] <sheilablackrose> hey coldhead
[22:20:29] <sheilablackrose> hey guys im using a custom checkbox. is there away to change the image of a disabled checkbox? http://jsfiddle.net/3UPfX/ is a rough idea
[22:22:21] <fuzai> Is there any way after writing ajax data to a page to force the browser to re-render it?  I've got an accordion within a tab set that after an update won't expand correctly, but when i used this before adding tabs i didn't have a problem and jsfiddle without the ajax worked and using this code on the previous page worked correctly and firebug says the data is there?
[22:22:46] <Cork> sheilablackrose: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/:disabled
[22:23:43] <sheilablackrose> thanks cork
[22:23:44] <Cork> fuzai: you're most likely losing javascript bindings (event listeners, a static list of dom elements or similar), and thats why it stops working
[22:23:56] <fuzai> hmmmm
[22:23:58] <Cork> fuzai: the browser will render things as soon as its added to the dom
[22:24:06] <Cork> but js might lose the connection
[22:24:33] <fuzai> I guess i can say i'm way in over my head here and i'm really confused as to why this isn't working
[22:24:49] <fuzai> the error console isn't throwing an error either
[22:24:55] <fuzai> but i'll keep looking ty :)
[22:24:58] <Cork> fuzai: do you have a testcase or a link?
[22:25:11] <fuzai> can i pm you a user / pass so you can see it?
[22:25:17] <coldhead> gross
[22:25:35] <fuzai> i tried to make a jsfiddle, but it worked
[22:25:43] <fuzai> pm = private message
[22:25:52] <coldhead> fuzai: it's like if you say to a room full of people "i want you to shout if anyone clicks on you" then all the people leave the room and some new people come in. you click on them and they don't know they're supposed to shout
[22:25:53] <Cork> i'm not sure i will have to time to dig enough into it
[22:26:41] <fuzai> ok i'll keep comparing my old to my new and see if i can't figure it out
[22:27:14] <coldhead> ?fweep
[22:27:17] <bot-t> coldhead, PLAM
[22:31:04] <coldhead> you never looked as lost as this sometimes it doesn't even look like you
[22:33:45] <fuzai> it seems like the data is there
[22:33:56] <fuzai> it's just like the tabs won't open far enough to show them
[22:36:34] <fuzai> Oh cool i figured it out
[22:36:38] <fuzai> i needed to add heightStyle: "content"
[22:37:02] <coldhead> yes, of course
[22:37:05] <coldhead> it's so obvious
[22:37:07] <coldhead> >: |
[22:37:42] * fuzai offers coldhead a warm trout
[22:38:18] <coldhead> you've made me so happy
[22:38:19] <Cork> :)
[22:39:42] <vacho> can someone tell me why the nivoslider just suddently stopped working here? http://toughbuilt.com
[22:40:51] <Cork> vacho: check your console you have a lot of script errors there
[22:40:58] <coldhead> vacho: at a guess i'd say you're including some code which is stealing the $
[22:41:05] <coldhead> $ !== jQuery
[22:41:20] <vacho> coldhead: ok.. im trying to figure out what it is.
[22:41:21] <coldhead> and i bet your code is trying to use $ as jQuery
[22:43:45] <fuzai> is there a way to figure out which tab is the current tab in a tabset from an external function?
[22:44:17] <fuzai> for instance when i click the update button, i'd like to know which tab i'm pulling from
[22:48:31] <vacho> coldhead: I renamed all my $ to jQuery..still issue
[22:49:13] <Cork> vacho: check you error console
[22:49:27] <Cork> your missing resources and additional problems
[22:49:51] <coldhead> you're*
[22:51:13] <vacho> Cork: I did check the console.
[22:51:16] <vacho> Cork: tell me more
[22:51:23] <Cork> uh
[22:52:22] <Cork> http://pastebin.com/RyZPVYsA
[22:53:23] <coldhead> thanks Cork
[23:06:34] <vacho> Cork: that paste was for me right? thanks..
[23:06:46] <vacho> Cork: I updated to latest version of jquery,also included jquery migrate..
[23:06:59] <vacho> got the slider to work but latest jquery broke other stuff.
[23:07:36] <Cork> vacho: the point is that you have missing files
[23:07:45] <Cork> and loads of errors
[23:08:01] <coldhead> you could use an older jQuery
[23:08:03] <Cork> "NetworkError: 404 Not Found - http://toughbuilt.com/wp-content/themes/toughbuilt/inc/js/slider.js" <-- this comes and goes
[23:08:04] <vacho> Cork: slider.js? it might just be a mistake include..trying to figure it out now
[23:08:27] <vacho> looking into that now.
[23:17:44] <ellusioner> hey
[23:18:32] <coldhead> hi
[23:28:55] <singh_abhinav> I have two forms in one page, I want to submit corresponding form on hyperlink click,   like when 1st link is clicked, first form should submit. when 2nd link is clicked, 2nd form should submit. Please find code here http://jsfiddle.net/2WuRS/  .. how should I do it?
[23:29:42] <Cork> ?.closest @ singh_abhinav
[23:29:43] <bot-t> singh_abhinav, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[23:30:08] <Cork> oh, your already doing it
[23:30:29] <Cork> singh_abhinav: so, what's the problem?
[23:31:43] <Cork> singh_abhinav: btw, your id's are invalid
[23:31:51] <Cork> you can't have two elements with the same id
[23:32:14] <coldhead> bam
[23:33:34] <singh_abhinav> I'm not able to POST,  clicking on links is not doing any thing, I have updated hyper link ids  Cork
[23:34:09] <Cork> singh_abhinav: http://jsfiddle.net/2WuRS/1/
[23:34:11] <Cork> wfm
[23:34:35] <coldhead> why is no one yelling about the onclick?!
[23:34:50] <Cork> coldhead: cause i removed the onclicks :)
[23:34:51] <coldhead> oh right, this is better
[23:34:59] <coldhead> yes, of course you did Cork <3
[23:36:38] <Cork> but might be worth to type it out
[23:36:59] <Cork> singh_abhinav: on*="" is a legacy form of entering event handers
[23:37:15] <Cork> it is not a recommended way of doing it
[23:37:50] <coldhead> onclick should only be used on sites with an intentionally retro 1990s feel
[23:38:06] <coldhead> you're not allowed to use them on new sites
[23:38:12] <coldhead> people will get hurt
[23:38:14] <Cork> it shouldn't be used; period
[23:38:49] <singh_abhinav> Cork:  okay :) , but in your example to which page form will POST , I want both the forms to POST to page.php
[23:39:13] <Cork> singh_abhinav: ya, that should work just fine
[23:39:29] <Cork> i just changed them to be a able to see that the correct form was triggered
[23:42:37] <singh_abhinav> Cork:   okay :)  Learnt better way of entering event handlers  :) thanks
[23:46:25] <coldhead> singh_abhinav: the nicest part about cork's way is that you don't have JS in your HTML
[23:49:28] <singh_abhinav> yeah coldhead :)
[23:53:25] <singh_abhinav> coldhead:  Cork:    I was wondering if there is better way to POST parameters in hyperlink than using forms?  Actually I have page in which there are many hyperlinks,  I want when user clicks on hyperlink, parameter should be POST to next page instead of appearing in URL as GET parameters
[23:53:51] <Cork> singh_abhinav: why not just use spans, and ajax?
[23:54:04] <Cork> or do you need to reload the pagE?
[23:54:07] <Cork> *page
[23:55:12] <Cork> singh_abhinav: alternatively you can have one form, and update it when the links are clicked
[23:55:37] <Cork> (either case i wouldn't use <a> tags unless you have a working link to add to them
[23:55:38] <Cork> )
