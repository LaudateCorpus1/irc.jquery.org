[00:00:07] <raj> oh boy
[00:02:06] <raj> Cork, out of curiosity, before I start fiddling with jsfiddle, do you see any general issues with my script? https://gist.github.com/a2e4e25a4001c36478e5
[00:02:12] <raj> it's actually my first ever js script
[00:02:18] <tw2113> congrats
[00:02:31] <raj> tw2113, don't congratulate yet, it doesn't work :)
[00:02:41] <tw2113> but it's your first script nonetheles
[00:02:42] <tw2113> s
[00:03:59] <Cork> raj: out of curiosity, why arn't you using the autocomplete plugin from jquery ui?
[00:04:32] <Cork> raj: but yes, i see some problems with how the script looks
[00:04:52] <Cork> but its most likly not related to your chrome problems
[00:05:08] <San4es> Hello. Who can help me please? I posted ticket on jQuery bug tracker. How to modify it?
[00:10:48] <raj> sorrry!
[00:10:53] <raj> got disconnected
[00:11:03] <raj> did I miss an answer?
[00:11:44] <Cork> raj: only that, yes theres issues with the code, but not something that relates to the chrome problem
[00:12:22] <raj> Cork, what issues do you see?
[00:19:23] <mindis|wurk> is there any way i can debug why $.getJSON doesn't send my array object? i already looped through the keys and values and saw nothing unusual there
[00:23:24] <pifantastic> mindis|wurk: are you using Inspector or Firebug to look at the request/response?
[00:39:57] <oal> Doing a .val('something') on an input field does not trigger the change event, but does it trigger any other events?
[00:40:44] <oal> I'd like my plugin to react to any changes on a text field, no matter if it's user input or setting the value with a .val or .attr call
[00:41:30] <donCams> oal, use .on or .bind, whichever
[00:42:29] <donCams> bind it to change and keyup
[00:45:14] <oal> donCams: but will that work when the user of my plugin does a $('input').val('something') ?
[00:46:53] <donCams> yeah. test it
[00:47:15] <raj> Cork?
[00:48:13] <JKarsrud> oal: yes, because then a change event would happen
[00:48:41] <ajpiano> a change event will not happen when you set via .val(), and donCams's suggestion will not remedy that
[00:48:53] <ajpiano> oal ^^
[00:49:11] <ajpiano> oal: the only way to do it would be to modify the behaviour of val itself to broadcast some custom change event for your plugin to listen to
[00:49:18] <ajpiano> or to tell users to .trigger("change")
[00:49:50] <oal> I see. Well, I'll try to find a way to deal with this. Thanks :)
[00:49:51] <poppiez> is there a better way of doing this: http://pastie.org/private/qubjbfy8swjmsy3hcxpoqa
[00:51:35] <Cork> raj: things like using for in on an array, and a few other stuff
[00:51:54] <raj> oh, k, didn't know that was faux pas
[00:52:14] <raj> putting this in jsfiddle is turning out pretty difficult
[00:52:25] <Cork> raj: you can get generic members added to Array.prototype if you use for in without checking for it
[00:52:48] <raj> without checking for it?
[00:53:02] <raj> checking for what?
[00:53:14] <Cork> raj: best is to use for(;;) when you check arrays
[00:53:28] <raj> what's that mean?
[00:53:29] <Cork> raj: else you need to check hasOwnProperty
[00:53:59] <raj> also, what's bad about for in with an array?
[00:54:00] <Cork> instead of for(var in array) you do for(var i = 0; i < array.length; i++ {}
[00:54:11] <raj> ah, i see
[00:54:12] <Cork> raj: look up i gave the reasons
[00:54:23] <Cork> *i++)
[00:55:56] <Cork> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/ALvQb/
[00:57:53] <raj> whoa
[00:57:55] <raj> how in the world
[00:58:29] <Cork> thats why for in is a bad idea :)
[00:58:34] <raj> cool
[00:58:36] <raj> thank you Cork
[00:58:38] <Cork> its the same thing for objects
[00:58:39] <raj> that's very important
[00:58:50] <raj> because of the shortcut of accessing items in an array?
[00:59:22] <Cork> no cause for in doesn't make any difference between properties added to the object it self or to the prototype
[00:59:37] <raj> Cork, k, yes, I understand
[00:59:41] <raj> thank you for that example
[01:00:29] <raj> Cork, i'm not sure how to make this useful
[01:00:30] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/BmqQj/
[01:00:52] <raj> I can fake the return data
[01:01:05] <Cork> raj: thats good enough actually
[01:01:07] <raj> and just send anything for the data
[01:01:29] <raj> well, it's not currently returning anything
[01:01:30] <Cork> where are you setting the focus on the company element?
[01:01:47] <raj> bottom of the script
[01:01:51] <raj> in the .ready function
[01:02:06] <Cork> i only see a bind event
[01:02:07] <Cork> not a trigger
[01:02:21] <raj> $(".autocomplete").focus(function(e) {
[01:02:29] <Cork> ya, that binds the event
[01:02:52] <raj> really?
[01:02:54] <raj> oh
[01:03:03] <josiah> the .offset() function retrieves the adjusted position including the margins, is it possible to retrieve the offset without taking into account the margins?
[01:03:12] <raj> so binding doesn't replace having a "trigger"?
[01:03:26] <Cork> bind means it listen for the event
[01:03:34] <Cork> if the event has already happend, it does nothing
[01:03:46] <Cork> (until it happens the next time)
[01:04:30] <raj> so that's not what I want?
[01:04:57] <raj> wait, how would the event have already happened?
[01:05:28] <Cork> raj: not completly sure, the code is a bit hard to follow
[01:05:30] <raj> it has to trigger the `autocomplete` function when the textbox is focused
[01:05:31] <raj> no?
[01:05:42] <Cork> no
[01:05:54] <Cork> well depends on when you want to show the dropdown
[01:06:06] <raj> i want it to show on keypress, and on focus
[01:06:09] <Cork> normally its shown when the user type in the field
[01:08:01] <raj> i shoulda taken out my commented lines for readability
[01:08:03] <raj> sorry bout that
[01:09:26] <Cork> raj: additionally, you need to handle rappid event fire
[01:09:42] <Cork> cause when the user type in the autocomplete you will fire multibe events to the server
[01:09:52] <raj> ya
[01:09:56] <Cork> and it might even be that the first request comes back last
[01:10:44] <raj> from my tinkering, it seemed that first came back first
[01:10:57] <raj> but even still, I'm thinking you'll tell me there's a more efficient way?
[01:11:00] <Cork> you can't count on that
[01:11:15] <Cork> you need to keep track of old requests
[01:11:24] <Cork> and do xhr.abort() when you fire a new one
[01:12:10] <Cork> and from tinkering a bit, it looks like only focus triggers a ajax request
[01:12:19] <Cork> both in ff12 and chromium for me
[01:12:40] <Cork> so something in your codes logic doens't do anything on keypress
[01:12:50] <raj> how does xhr.abort() get my server to abort?
[01:13:14] <Cork> it closes the connection
[01:13:27] <Cork> only way to abort a request
[01:13:36] <raj> kk, cool, I'll throw that in
[01:13:40] <Cork> (until ppl can use spdy)
[01:14:11] <raj> interesting
[01:14:36] <raj> so I'm still not seeing what the issue with my .keypress or my .focus
[01:14:44] <raj> is
[01:15:39] <Cork> raj: well to start with your sending this to autocomplete
[01:15:51] <Cork> thats the dom object, not a jquery one
[01:17:30] <raj> you mean $this?
[01:17:36] <Cork> yes
[01:17:39] <raj> $(this), that is
[01:17:48] <Cork> its both actually
[01:17:52] <raj> yeah
[01:17:55] <raj> what's wrong with that?
[01:18:01] <Cork> your not using it :)
[01:18:10] <Cork> autocomplete.bind(this, this)
[01:18:37] <Cork> should be autocomplete.bind(null, $this)
[01:18:40] <raj> oh
[01:18:53] <raj> there was a reason for that
[01:18:56] <raj> which I forget right now
[01:19:14] <Cork> well your code expects to get a jquery object
[01:19:21] <raj> but the code around it has changed a bunch, so null might be correct now
[01:19:22] <Cork> so it won't work without it
[01:19:40] <Cork> thats actually not the main point
[01:19:49] <Cork> the secon argument is the main problem
[01:19:56] <raj> this = $(".autocomplete_div.active > .autocomplete")
[01:20:13] <raj> $this = $(".autocomplete")
[01:20:15] <raj> no?
[01:20:27] <Cork> you can't set this that way
[01:20:41] <raj> no, i'm not saying to set
[01:20:50] <raj> i'm just saying what `this` is equal to
[01:20:58] <raj> or referring to
[01:21:02] <Cork> no this is iqual to the dom element
[01:21:05] <Cork> not a jquery element
[01:21:15] <Cork> this == $(".autocomplete_div.active > .autocomplete")[0]
[01:21:28] <Cork> well no
[01:21:38] <Cork> its this == $(".autocomplete")[0]
[01:21:49] <raj> where'd [0] come from?
[01:22:07] <Cork> it meas it grabs the dom element from the jquery object
[01:22:18] <Cork> another example is document.getElementById
[01:22:53] <Cork> so that means this and $(this) is NOT the same thing
[01:23:18] <raj> ok
[01:23:35] <raj> but shouldn't I want autocomplete bound to $(".autocomplete_div.active > .autocomplete")
[01:23:52] <raj> so it is listening to the correct (active) textbox?
[01:24:14] <Cork> uh...
[01:24:17] <Cork> that won't work
[01:24:47] <Cork> that selector is run once, and then that element is bound, so if you move the .active class the event will still point to the same element
[01:25:22] <Cork> and as focus most likly isn't fired before the keypress event is bound, no element what so ever is bound by that handler
[01:25:24] <raj> but the selector is run each time there's a different textbox focused, no?
[01:25:30] <Cork> no
[01:25:37] <Cork> the selector is run on .ready
[01:25:41] <raj> oh
[01:25:51] <Cork> then the event on that element is run each time focus happens on that element
[01:25:59] <raj> ok, so sounds like my code is totally screwed then
[01:26:04] <Cork> you want delegate or live
[01:26:23] <Cork> and ya, most likly rething how you structure it
[01:26:30] <Cork> *rethink
[01:26:31] <raj> crap
[01:26:46] <raj> this took me like a week
[01:27:22] <raj> so should this stuff not be within the .ready function?
[01:27:35] <raj> and be standalone event listeners?
[01:27:42] <raj> or triggers, as you said
[01:27:48] <Cork> raj: well i think it should be inside a plugin actually :)
[01:28:03] <Cork> $.fn.autocomplete = function() {}
[01:28:07] <raj> meaning, use the jquery-ui plugin?
[01:28:11] <Cork> no
[01:28:18] <Cork> then do everything needed for the autocomplete to work in there
[01:28:36] <Cork> that way you don't need to duplicate the code each time you want to use the autocomplete plugin
[01:28:52] <raj> Cork, I thought I did that
[01:28:57] <Cork> nope
[01:29:05] <Cork> you have a function your calling from ready
[01:29:16] <raj> I just add class="autocomplete" to an inputbox and it should have autocomplete available
[01:30:00] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/BmqQj/1/
[01:30:04] <GuestQ888658> Anybody use jquery.simulate for event simulation in tests?
[01:30:10] <Cork> raj: first 5 lines
[01:30:17] <Cork> opps
[01:30:20] <Cork> for got a bit ;P
[01:30:59] <Cork> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/BmqQj/2/
[01:32:12] <raj> what's (jQuery)?
[01:32:29] <Cork> it sends jQuery as a parameter to the wrapper
[01:32:35] <Cork> it makes sure $ is jQuery
[01:32:46] <raj> oh
[01:32:48] <raj> cool
[01:33:02] <Cork> all plugins should always be wrapped like that, to not conflict with other frameworks
[01:33:22] <Cork> anyway have a look at delegate and on see ?.on see ?.delegate
[01:33:23] <bot-t> Cork, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:33:23] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[01:33:40] <raj> Cork, what's the reasoning for doing this though?
[01:33:45] <raj> like making a plugin for jquery
[01:33:55] <raj> what's the advantage?
[01:33:56] <Cork> raj: reusing code
[01:34:04] <raj> reusing the code on other websites?
[01:34:15] <Cork> and on the page
[01:34:22] <raj> cuz the autocomplete.js script I have in my _base.html
[01:34:36] <raj> so i don't have to repeat it at all
[01:34:50] <Cork> raj: right now, ya
[01:35:07] <Cork> but if you want to bind an additional autocomplete with another url or something
[01:35:27] <Cork> then you need to duplicate the code, as its so static
[01:35:57] <raj> but I still have to transport this script though, right?
[01:36:19] <raj> or you're saying to add it to a local copy of jquery library
[01:36:20] <raj> ?
[01:36:26] <Cork> transport?
[01:36:40] <raj> like transport to another server for another url
[01:36:44] <Cork> you can add it at the same place your adding your autocomplete function
[01:37:04] <Cork> how the code is isolated doens't affect that
[01:37:26] <raj> i must be thickheaded
[01:37:28] <raj> i'm not getting it
[01:43:57] <daguerre> hello - I would like to ask for some help with jquery numerical property of some object;
[01:44:06] <raj> Cork, besides for the learning experience, would you recommend the jquery-ui autocomplete plugin?
[01:44:20] <Cork> raj: ya, i would
[01:44:34] <raj> hmm, k
[01:44:35] <Cork> that was actually one of the things i asked earlier :)
[01:44:41] <raj> oh
[01:44:44] <Cork> (why you wheren't)
[01:44:48] <daguerre> the object consist of two properties (first - "tip" - is numerical and second "date" is a string) - I can see this through Google Chrome Inspect Console.
[01:44:57] <raj> just cuz I thought it would be a simple script to implement
[01:45:02] <raj> ...meaning to write myself
[01:45:05] <daguerre> when I type this.tip - it returns (undefined)
[01:45:10] <raj> turns out, it isn't =T
[01:45:20] <Cork> raj: autocomplete, is actually quite complex :)
[01:45:29] <daguerre> when I type this.date - it returns the proper string
[01:45:42] <Cork> daguerre: thats the object this?
[01:45:45] <Cork> *whats
[01:45:55] <raj> Cork, I also wanted some micro-control over things like onfocus and onkeypress events having the results show
[01:46:09] <daguerre> this is a response from the jspreadsheet - a list of objects
[01:46:16] <raj> and if enter is pressed it should populate the textbox with the highlighted result item
[01:46:38] <Cork> daguerre: uh.. ok so its a dom list or?
[01:47:02] <Cork> raj: never tired to get focus to work, but enter is simple
[01:47:34] <daguerre> Cork: how to check it? When I press typeof(this) it returns "object"
[01:48:08] <daguerre> console returns something like [>Object, >Object, >Object, >Object, >Object] etc.
[01:48:24] <Cork> console.log(this)
[01:48:24] <raj> Cork, so it's customizable to that extent though?
[01:48:42] <Cork> raj: its quite heavily extendible ya
[01:48:51] <Cork> its the point of it
[01:49:03] <Cork> its a barebone implementation, but should be easy to extend
[01:49:45] <daguerre> Cork: console returned two lines. The first is some array/list of objects [>Object, >Object, >Object, >Object, >Object], the second line is <- undefined.
[01:50:27] <Cork> ok, and whats console.log(this[0]) ?
[01:51:04] <daguerre> it is also two lines. The first is >Object (only one now), the second is undefined also
[01:51:22] <raj> cool, guess I'll abandon ship then
[01:51:27] <Cork> daguerre: if you press the arrow to the left of Object what does it show?
[01:51:27] <raj> try my luck with a different script
[01:51:38] <daguerre> when I press the > Object it shows me three elements: tip: 34.5, date: "01/15/2012" and >__proto__: Object
[01:52:05] <Cork> ok so this[0].tip and this[0].date should give you what your looking for
[01:53:01] <Cork> or if you want them all for(var i=0; i < this.length;i++) { var obj = this[i]; obj.tip; obj.date }
[01:53:07] <daguerre> Cork: I have tried this. the first command this[0].tip returned with undefined, the second: this[0].date returned with proper date "01/15/2012"
[01:53:45] <Cork> daguerre: do you have an url this can be seen?
[01:53:48] <pom> I'm having troubles getting .on() to work as .live() did. It just doesn't live on to new elements as live do and I can see nothing in the live() documentation that deals with this.
[01:54:23] <daguerre> Cork - I will prepare it for You :)
[01:54:56] <Cork> pom: $(document).on('click', 'a', function() {});
[01:55:14] <Cork> pom: the live way of writing it does't exist with on
[01:55:24] <Cork> its done the same way delegate worked
[01:55:34] <Cork> s/worked/workes/
[01:55:46] <pom> Alrighty! I'll give it a try. Thankie
[01:55:48] <Cork> gah... what ever
[02:02:13] <daguerre> Cork: http://skygate.pl/projects/ning/cork/
[02:02:56] <daguerre> I am debugging it under the newest Google Chrome, I put the breakpoint  in the 18th line of myscript.js.
[02:03:05] <daguerre> and here I switch to the console view;
[02:04:06] <Cork> daguerre: could you add window.test_values = []; at the top of your script
[02:04:19] <Cork> and then window.test_values.push(this) at line 15?
[02:05:05] <aaronmcadam> ?ajax101
[02:05:05] <bot-t> Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[02:05:12] <daguerre> Cork: ok, I think this is done :)
[02:06:41] <Cork> daguerre: nope test_values should be inside the each loop :)
[02:07:46] <daguerre> Cork: Ok, sure think - I have updated it now :)
[02:09:30] <Cork> daguerre: this[' tip']
[02:09:45] <Cork> theres a space in the object name :D
[02:10:13] <daguerre> Cork - You are great man!
[02:10:15] <daguerre> Many thanks :)
[02:10:22] <Cork> heh np :)
[02:11:37] <pom> What is the equivalent to .sibling() that also includes itself?
[02:11:48] <gyzmodo> yeah, he's great man
[02:12:07] <Cork> pom: siblings().andSelf()
[02:12:27] <Cork> or parent().children()
[02:13:03] <daguerre> Cork: Hey, it is for You :) Thanks once more: http://skygate.pl/projects/ning/cork/
[02:30:47] <aidan101> hey can anyone help me make it so that the transition direction changes on this pager, depending on the direction the user navigates. So like forward would be right to left backwards left to right

[02:39:17] <soee> hi, how can i check if checkbox with given ID is checked ?
[02:39:56] <raj> Cork, gotta question
[02:40:09] <Cork> soee: $('#id').is(':checked')
[02:40:10] <raj> why do you suppose facebook doesn't use one inkling of jquery
[02:40:27] <Cork> raj: you mean on there page?
[02:40:31] <raj> yeah
[02:40:35] <Cork> or in there api?
[02:40:41] <raj> page
[02:40:44] <AdvoWork> anyone got any ideas how i can use jquery to zip up some files for download? or similaer
[02:41:01] <Cork> raj: they prob don't want the overhead of loading a framework; or hey'r using another framework
[02:41:24] <raj> is it that much?
[02:41:38] <raj> <1 second longer to load the page?
[02:41:43] <Cork> AdvoWork: except implementing a zip parser in javascript, you can't
[02:41:59] <Cork> raj: well the load is a bit, but not that much
[02:42:14] <raj> so what overhead?
[02:42:20] <Cork> raj: but a framework will always be slower then a barebone pure js call
[02:42:27] <raj> oh
[02:42:30] <Cork> raj: as long as you write it as fast as it can be
[02:42:43] <Cork> raj: though many fail to do that
[02:42:44] <raj> which my autocomplete script wasn't doing anyway, right? :)
[02:43:28] <Cork> raj: pure js is often so much more code, that that makes the difference moot
[02:43:39] <Cork> raj: it all depends on how much speed matter
[02:44:04] <raj> well, speed is everything really
[02:44:09] <raj> if it's the same functionality
[02:44:11] <raj> no?
[02:44:19] <Cork> not always
[02:44:38] <Cork> managability is often more valuable then speed
[02:44:55] <Cork> if its a fraction slower, but much easier to mainain, then..
[02:45:13] <soee> Cork, thank you
[02:45:23] <Cork> soee: yrw
[02:45:30] <jonkristian> Howdy, If I add a checkbox with jquery, will it be included in the php $_POST when i submit the form?
[02:45:30] <raj> cool
[02:45:42] <soee> what is the easiest wat to activate/disable submit button on checkbox state change ?
[02:45:59] <Cork> jonkristian: as long as it has a name and a value, yes
[02:46:32] <jonkristian> Cork: ok, thanks. I couldn't see it in $_POST, guess something else is wrong.
[02:50:11] <AdvoWork> Cork, have you ever heard of that done, or do you know of any other ways to do it?
[02:52:48] <shomon> hi, I'm trying to get the jquery validation plugin working. It's not giving errors, but doesn't do any validation that I can see..
[02:52:54] <shomon> does the code have to be before the form?
[02:54:49] <Cork> soee: something like http://jsfiddle.net/RzGdn/
[02:55:36] <Cork> AdvoWork: not really, theres been talk about supporting websites sending "assets" to the browser for later use
[02:55:43] <Cork> but beside that, nothing
[02:56:25] <jonkristian> Cork: I am not submitting values with jquery, just regular php, are you sure it will be included?
[02:56:43] <Cork> its just normal dom elements
[02:56:56] <Cork> as long as they'r added to the form, and has a name and value, yes they will
[02:57:03] <jonkristian> Cork: ok
[02:57:18] <jonkristian> strange though, I can't find it in $_POST
[02:57:26] <jonkristian> need to investigate further
[02:57:39] <Cork> jonkristian: when are you adding it to the form?
[02:58:53] <jonkristian> a checkbox from a select option list, when you click the option it will add it to a list of checkboxes.
[02:59:17] <jonkristian> it has name and value, i can't see it at all in globals
[03:01:27] <Cork> jonkristian: http://jsfiddle.net/R6uy7/

[03:06:33] <shomon> I'm trying to set up the validate plugin for a form. Also I want to have a condition validating different fields depending on what submit button is pressed
[03:06:35] <shomon> http://jsfiddle.net/tJjEa/1/
[03:07:02] <shomon> here is what I've got so far.. Can't tell what is wrong. It'll not let me submit, so it's doing something.. but I can't tell what isn't working
[03:12:21] <gyzmodo> hello guys
[03:13:01] <gyzmodo> i've this code: $('.twitter-inner').css({ 'height':$('.post').height() });
[03:14:06] <gyzmodo> how can i add here + 50 pixels?
[03:14:14] <gyzmodo> to twitter-inner's height
[03:14:30] <jonkristian> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/R6uy7/4/
[03:15:57] <gyzmodo> any ideas?
[03:19:02] <jonkristian> Cork: I just realized something, checkbox values aren't submitted unless they are checked, ugh.
[03:21:27] <amccloud> anyway to loop over a list of urls, call $.ajax, and call a function when all request are complete?
[03:22:12] <shesek> amccloud, var after = function(times, fn) {  var counter = 0; return functio() { ++counter === times && fn(); }; };
[03:22:42] <raj> Cork, since I'd like for autocomplete to be enabled for any input box that has class="autocomplete" and I want it activated on focus and on keypress of that particular box, how might I use .autocompete()?
[03:22:55] <shesek> amccloud, var callback = after(urls.length, function() { /*  all urls finished  */ }); urls.forEach(function(url){$.get(url, callback);});
[03:23:04] <shesek> amccloud, s/functio/function
[03:23:07] <mindis|wurk> are there any known bugs in mouseenter or mouseleave?
[03:24:31] <amccloud> shesek: I thought about that. I was hoping jquery had something built in. I'm looking into $.Deferred. At a glance it seems like what I need.
[03:24:45] <shomon> has anyone used the validate jquery plugin?
[03:25:18] <gyzmodo> $('.twitter-inner').css({'height':($('.post').height() - '10px')});
[03:25:24] <gyzmodo> what's wrong with this code?
[03:26:04] <mindis|wurk> you're trying to do math with strings
[03:26:07] <shesek> amccloud, yeah, you can use $.when() too
[03:26:43] <shesek> $.when.apply($, urls.map(function(url){  return $.get(url);  })).then(function() { /*  all urls finished  */ })
[03:26:59] <gyzmodo> mindis|wurk, how can i fix my problem
[03:27:25] <mindis|wurk> gyzmodo probably by doing something like $('.post').height() - 10
[03:27:26] <shesek> gyzmodo, do math with numbers?
[03:28:21] <shesek> amccloud, or just $.when.apply($, urls.map($.get)).then(...), if you don't need to customize anything in the parameters to $.get
[03:28:44] <gyzmodo> moment
[03:28:53] <amccloud> sweet thanks
[03:30:15] <VaLeRi> http://www.clicksia.com/index.php?ref=valerinanchev
[03:31:39] <stevefrost> I have dropdown x and input y. the value of x dictates whether y is disabled or not, which is better: check the value of x or check if y is disabled?
[03:32:30] <shesek> stevefrost, well, it really depends on what you're doing
[03:32:44] <stevefrost> i only need to validate y if it isn't disabled
[03:32:57] <shesek> than validate its not disabled
[03:33:02] <gyzmodo> mindis|wurk, thanks
[03:33:10] <shesek> no need to couple it to the select box - that logic might change in the future
[03:33:26] <stevefrost> shesek, good point :)
[03:40:39] <snagnever> morning
[03:45:03] <raj> how do I use jquery-ui's .autocomplete() plugin on the inputbox in focus if it has class="autocomplete"
[03:45:06] <raj> ?
[03:46:18] <Hooloovoork> raj: the jquery-ui docs has very good examples. they're better at explaining than we are.
[03:46:35] <raj> Hooloovoork, I was hoping for that
[03:46:40] <raj> but http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/ seems pretty slim
[03:47:12] <Aamir> raj:  http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#option-autoFocus ?
[03:47:14] <Hooloovoork> well if you take the example they have there and get it to work you can build from there.
[03:48:26] <Aamir> raj:   something like   $( ".selector" ).autocomplete({ autoFocus:  $(this).hasClass('autocomplete')  }); ?
[03:48:44] <raj> cool, I was close-->
[03:48:44] <raj> $(".autocomplete").focus(function() { $(this).addClass('active')});
[03:49:06] <Hooloovoork> autofocus just select the first result in the autocomplete list, no?
[03:49:36] <Hooloovoork> it's a boolean option
[03:51:17] <raj> Hooloovoork, not sure what your line meant?
[03:51:27] <raj> autofocus just *selects ?
[03:52:00] <Hooloovoork> raj: autofocus is a boolean option that when is set to true select the first item in the autocomplete list
[03:52:09] <raj> the thing is, there are like 10 different inputboxes on the page with class="autocomplete"
[03:52:19] <raj> but the script should only be running on the box that's in focus currently
[03:52:26] <Hooloovoork> ...
[03:52:43] <Hooloovoork> raj: just run it like the first example on the site.
[03:52:47] <Hooloovoork> it'll work
[03:53:17] <Hooloovoork> you don't have to remove and add the plugin to a element every time you select it. the plugin detects which inputbox you have active
[03:53:30] <raj> oh
[03:55:40] <raj> so do I not need to worry about ajax POST and whatnot?
[03:56:47] <Hooloovoork> raj: um.... if you want to get the hitlist from ajax you do.
[03:57:01] <Hooloovoork> if you don't wanna use ajax, don't worry about it.
[03:57:16] <raj> yup, i want it to come from ajax
[03:57:24] <Hooloovoork> then you have to worry about ajax.
[04:00:33] <raj> Hooloovoork, so do I do the post inside the .autocomplete() method or outside?
[04:01:11] <Hooloovoork> raj: well... look at the example. there you can see one way of doing it.
[04:01:23] <raj> there's no ajax there
[04:01:27] <Hooloovoork> you can run it outside the source method, but why would you
[04:01:29] <phryk> I want to cycle through all the divs within a containing div ('div#foo > div'). ie display them one after each other (in time). How would I go about doing that?
[04:01:29] <raj> i see the source is that array
[04:01:37] <Hooloovoork> yes there is if you chose the json example.
[04:01:44] <raj> really?
[04:01:47] <raj> ohhhh
[04:01:50] <raj> i didn't see that on the side
[04:01:51] <raj> thanks
[04:03:10] <Hooloovoork> phryk: i think you have to explain better.
[04:03:22] <Hooloovoork> what are you gonna use it for?
[04:04:20] <phryk> Hooloovoork: A simply 'slider' thing… Display one div, fade it out, display the next one and so on.
[04:04:26] <phryk> simple*
[04:05:54] <raj> Hooloovoork, do I need--> data = $element.serialize()
[04:06:15] <raj> for the $.post() function
[04:08:19] <phryk> Hooloovoork: Ah I think I can get the first one with .first and then save that as current and do current.next() to iterate through the divs. Going to try that out :)
[04:13:09] <z3yo> Hi there
[04:13:20] <StevenCodes22> Sup z
[04:18:28] <soee> what is the best function to use to update some field when content of other field is changed>
[04:19:11] <StevenCodes22> soee:  onchange
[04:19:25] <soee> StevenCodes22, ok thank you
[04:19:40] <Hooloovoork> phryk: that's a bad thing to do. you can do $("div > children").each(function() {})
[04:19:51] <Hooloovoork> and interate like that. it's a lot faster.
[04:20:13] <phryk> Hooloovoork: I've seen that, but that executes the given function for each element simultaneously, doesn't it?
[04:21:03] <xec> phryk: no, one at a time
[04:21:33] <Hooloovoork> phryk: it's just a wrapped for loop so no, it's one on each loop.
[04:21:50] <xec> phryk: but i do recommend .children() rather than the > child selector, as it is a bit quicker
[04:21:51] <phryk> Ah awesome, then it would be exactly what I was looking for.
[04:22:34] <phryk> How would I make the .each() loop? Wrapping anything in while(true) seems insanely dumb…
[04:22:47] <xec> each *is* a loop
[04:23:05] <xec> the function provided is the body of the loop
[04:23:19] <xec> and executed once for each element in the collection
[04:23:56] <phryk> I mean, I want it to go on forever, when it executed the function for the last element, restart the whole thing with the first element.
[04:28:23] <amccloud> Any reason $.ajax error callback response would be "BAD REQUEST" even though my responses body is {"email": ["Already a team member."]}
[04:28:51] <soee> StevenCodes22, and if i want text that is typed in input filed automaticly show up in other section of my page ?
[04:29:33] <StevenCodes22> soee jsfiddle it
[04:30:41] <Danielc1234> Hi all, our menu bar is throwing errors and when doing a google search, said to update to 1.7, which I did, but still drop down is not working. any ideas on where to look? www.adirondack-chairs.cc
[04:31:19] <bartmax> hi beautifull people
[04:31:19] <Danielc1234> this is the error... event.layerX and event.layerY are broken and deprecated in WebKit. They will be removed from the engine in the near future.
[04:31:39] <bartmax> Danielc1234: i got that too, probabilly dropdown plugin
[04:32:23] <phryk> Mhh, I now have a different problem. $(window).load() gives me an error, saying '$ is not a function'
[04:32:45] <Danielc1234> bartmax: it is a magento cart and should be stock on the menu bar.
[04:33:32] <bartmax> Danielc1234: i mean, this error was introducen in early versions of chrome, in my case was of using dropdown ability plugin (js)
[04:33:54] <bartmax> either way, is still working with no prob. so if you site is not working, it has nothing to do with that error.
[04:33:54] <Cork> phryk: make sure you've loaded jquery before your using $()
[04:34:20] <Danielc1234> bartmax: yeah, I already disabled all ext in chrome, checked in all browsers and still does not work.
[04:34:49] <Danielc1234> bartmax: are the subs of the top menu bar showing for you?
[04:35:03] <bartmax> Danielc1234: i mean the website... (paste link, i just entered the channel)
[04:35:17] <Danielc1234> sorry http://www.adirondack-chairs.cc/
[04:35:57] <bartmax> everything looks fine.
[04:35:59] <bartmax> i guess
[04:36:15] <Danielc1234> when you hover over the top menu bar, there should be a drop down.
[04:36:15] <bartmax> besides picture #4 in slideshow :D
[04:36:23] <Danielc1234> yeah noticed that.
[04:37:27] <soee> StevenCodes22, have no code now to show, just asking how can i achieve something like this: user is typing text in filed X and this text automaticly shows up inside some other container like span, so if user add new sign or remove one in filed X its value automaticly goes to span
[04:38:00] <Danielc1234> bartmax: can you see the drop downs on your end?
[04:38:07] <bartmax> Danielc1234: nope, the event.layerX / Y has nothing to do with it tho
[04:38:38] <fraxture> hi all, irc question?  does anyone know how i can remove a previously registered irc nickname so that i can add a new one?
[04:39:04] <bartmax> Danielc1234: in the source code, no menu are ready to pop either...
[04:39:05] <Cork> fraxture: ask in #freenode
[04:39:15] <rue> fraxture: ^ Or read the docs on freenode.net
[04:39:25] <Cork> fraxture: and have a look in /ns help
[04:39:46] <Danielc1234> I know, it doesnt make it that far. I thought the js, etc was causing it not to load.
[04:40:11] <soee> ok keypress() was it
[04:40:53] <fraxture> thx jsut figured it out :)
[04:45:16] <amcsi_work> hello
[04:46:55] <jetienne> q. what the j stands for in jQuery ? where can i find a doc about the origin of the name ?
[04:47:31] <amcsi_work> what's the nicest way of making it so when I click a div, it turns red, and from then on, if I click anywhere, it turns back to transparent? My problem is that if I bind click to the document in the div click callback, the same click bubbles up until the document and turns the div back to transparent right away. What's the nicest way of solving this without stopping the propagation?
[04:47:55] <amcsi_work> javascript query perhaps?
[04:48:04] <amcsi_work> @jetienne
[04:48:29] <jetienne> amcsi_work: yep it was my guess too. but i would like to be sure :)
[04:49:25] <djangoobie> I'm trying to add a check whether one the children of a div have focus after a Select element gets blurred. if($("#my_container").children.is(":focus")) returns false, any ideas?
[04:50:19] <Cork> djangoobie: blur happens before focus is set
[04:50:36] <Cork> you would have to check what target its losing focus to
[04:51:48] <djangoobie> Cork: ah that would explain it! thanks
[04:56:56] <megaTherion> hi
[04:58:16] <megaTherion> I've some issue's regarding manipulating the DOM tree
[04:58:23] <soee> i there any way to remove all html tags from input field content ?
[04:58:52] <megaTherion> if I append sth by $('#foo').append(xhtml code here) cant I select it via the CSS selectors?
[05:01:18] <michelem> hello folks. I'm trying to get http://jacklmoore.com/colorbox/ to fetch the halo HTML content from an extra HTTP hit, but it appears the "href" parameter is not meant for that. How can I do that in jquery?
[05:02:02] <michelem> the flow shall be: user gets to a page, clicks on an image, halo opens with content fetched in another GET.
[05:11:48] <phryk> Hooloovoork: Now I have a function that fades in an element, waits a set time and then fades the element out. Defined within the each().
[05:12:04] <phryk> But all elements are faded in simulataneously and faded out simultaneously.
[05:12:56] <phryk> Hooloovoork: http://npaste.de/Qj/ This is the function I wrote to do this.
[05:14:38] <mawalu> I want to know, if there a way to test if the user can use css 3
[05:15:00] <raj> I have https://gist.github.com/4d71416ea019b643e75c , but I want to also send the `name` attribute from the input box

[05:26:37] <sviatovigt> to only one listner and one function
[05:27:21] <sviatovigt> how can I send as a parameter in the callback functions the name of the field?
[05:28:40] <snagnever> hey! let's say i'm calling a function fooFunction(); how can i set the 'this' on the function context?
[05:29:29] <Cork> sviatovigt: function(error) { validateLastName(error, $('#email')); }
[05:29:52] <Cork> sviatovigt: in other words, wrap it in an anonymus function that sends the extra parameter you want
[05:30:13] <sviatovigt> can you please make the change on my code?
[05:31:09] <Cork> sviatovigt: http://jsfiddle.net/Z2pwV/1/
[05:31:15] <Cork> i only modded validate email
[05:35:28] <sviatovigt> ok
[05:35:30] <sviatovigt> thanks
[05:35:59] <sviatovigt> is there a way to shortten the code by writing only one listner for all the fields
[05:36:20] <sviatovigt> and then just detect the field that triggered the event
[05:36:21] <sviatovigt> ?
[05:36:55] <Cork> sviatovigt: ya $(this) would work too
[05:37:36] <felipe_Brz> this selector $('.view .ui-button') should return all elements whose  class is .ui-button which live inside elements whose class is .view, correct??
[05:37:52] <snagnever> in short: how jquery sets a "this" inside the function call as being the element that triggered that? i want to do something simillar
[05:41:14] <sviatovigt> cork: can you please make me an example on my code?
[05:41:52] <Cork> sviatovigt: sorry i don't have time for that right now
[05:42:09] <sviatovigt> ok

[05:52:48] <w33d> Hi All!
[05:53:02] <w33d> I am having a serious conflict between two jQuery scripts on a clients website
[05:53:09] <w33d> And am at my wits end trying to solve it
[05:53:38] <w33d> the conflict is between prototype.js and a script called dcmegamenu.1.3.3.js
[05:54:06] <w33d> altohugh there are quite a few other js files within the header to for both to work
[05:54:23] <w33d> only conflicts in Internet Explorer (I hate IE)
[05:54:40] <w33d> http://www.furnituremind.co.uk/product.php/3117/21/bilbao-king--size-bed-with-optional--bedside-cabinets
[05:54:48] <phryk> I want to use each() to iterate through a list of divs, display each a few seconds, then fade it out and show the next div. However I seem to only be able to have *all* the divs fade in and fade out at the same time. How do I get the animations to be after each other and not at the same time?
[05:56:11] <w33d> anyone able to lend a hand with this conflict issue?
[05:57:33] <megaTherion> Im trying to fadeIn/fadeOut <object> elements, but without success - is it only possible for img's?
[05:58:06] <leo> @megaTherion Nop, you can fadeIn/out anything
[05:58:24] <megaTherion> leo: well I know my func is going to be executed, no error messages either - I just did obj.fadeOut("slow")
[05:58:42] <megaTherion> but it wont gonna happen, tried other things as well like .hide("fade", {}, 1000)
[05:59:37] <leo> try .hide()
[06:00:26] <megaTherion> leo: huh, ok that worked
[06:00:47] <megaTherion> then Im doing sth wrong but what could it be - I just followed the examples of the documentation
[06:02:23] <solidus-river> how do i get the offset from the top of a div to the top of the page?
[06:02:49] <diverdude> Is there a jquery chat plugin which works like the facebook chat?
[06:02:58] <leo> @megaTherion : What you css looks like on this element ?
[06:03:21] <megaTherion> xhtml = '<object class="show" data="' + gallery[i][0] + '" type="image/jpeg">' + gallery[i][1] + '</object>';
[06:03:34] <megaTherion> leo: it's exacly something like this, its going to be append to an div via JS
[06:04:25] <megaTherion> leo: I did some fading before with jQuey, but Im not *that* experienced + its a longer time ago already (I used <img> while back but it was a completly different site + work)
[06:05:34] <leo> @megaTherion Can you pu a example on jsfiddle please ?
[06:05:46] <megaTherion> dont even know what jsfiddle is :(
[06:06:54] <leo> @megaTherion http://jsfiddle.net/ this way we can have a look at your code
[06:07:10] <phryk> Whoever told me to use each(): FYVM
[06:07:32] <w33d> anyone help with a prototype.js conflict?
[06:08:40] <megaTherion> leo: http://jsfiddle.net/9xpeW/
[06:09:12] <megaTherion> leo: as you can see by the comments, I tried some stuff already none of it worked - but you can see what I basically want to do
[06:10:02] <megaTherion> leo: thing is I get this images via ajax by an PHP backend (which works well), because I've *a lot* of images and there must be added some dynamic selection also later, after the fading stuff works
[06:10:32] <leo> @megaTherion : don't use "opacity", instead : display:none and display:block
[06:11:43] <megaTherion> leo: as said, I tried much already - none worked even not the "predefined" functions as fadeIn, fadeOut or hide("fade", ...)
[06:11:49] <diverdude> Is there a jquery chat plugin which works like the facebook chat?
[06:11:53] <w33d> fixed it
[06:11:56] <w33d> thanks for your help
[06:11:59] <w33d> naaaaaaaaaaaaat
[06:12:05] <megaTherion> but Im gonna try it thru display only
[06:14:55] <megaTherion> leo: still no fading
[06:15:48] <leo> @megaTherion FadeIn ou fadeOut ?
[06:16:41] <megaTherion> leo: I tried current.fadeOut("slow").css("display", "none") - what really does work is the css manipulating, the image disappears, even the new ones appear but no fading
[06:16:49] <SeaOrifice> is it possible to rotate an image about itself using jquery and a single image (no tricks like replacing 6-7 images having little bit of rotation) ???
[06:17:35] <leo> @megaTherion try just current.fadeOut("slow");
[06:18:04] <shisma> hi
[06:18:32] <megaTherion> leo: nothing happens ^^
[06:18:33] <shisma> is it possible to return a certain step of an animation?
[06:19:39] <megaTherion> leo: by the way, I noticed other wired things - for example its xhtml, but I noticed I got wired messages if I deliver it as xml (o is null) - I googled and found that it works if it's without xml header etc.
[06:19:47] <megaTherion> however I wonder if jQuery isnt compatible to xhtml as well
[06:20:30] <shisma> for instance I say $('.foo').css({marginLeft:0}).animate({marginLeft:10})
[06:20:51] <shisma> and i want to get margin-left:5px
[06:21:00] <leo> @megaTherion : sorry without your code i can't help you
[06:21:03] <shisma> as the middle of the animation
[06:21:36] <megaTherion> leo: nevermind, I'll assume it has sth todo with <object>  then or xhtml... my code isnt a lot I posted (thats all javascript code I have)
[06:22:11] <Wiz_KeeD> hey guys, i have a question
[06:22:18] <leo> @shisma : http://api.jquery.com/animate/ take a look at the step options
[06:22:26] <Wiz_KeeD> hover images are only loaded when asked for in css, is there a way i can preload them so i would stop this effect?
[06:23:38] <shisma> yes, this adds a callback on every step
[06:23:52] <soee> i want to puv input field value into some div container but can i remove all hmtl tags from this input value before it is put into div?
[06:23:59] <shisma> but how can force a single step in the animation?
[06:27:57] <leo> @Wiz_KeeD http://css-tricks.com/css-sprites/
[06:28:20] <Wiz_KeeD> ah, you want me to load one image
[06:28:28] <Wiz_KeeD> and place a background position depending on the action
[06:28:40] <Wiz_KeeD> change it accordingly
[06:28:40] <leo> thats right
[06:28:44] <Wiz_KeeD> yeah good point
[06:29:03] <solidus-river> how do i force trigger a window resize event?
[06:29:48] <megaTherion> leo: figured it out, you cannot fade object
[06:30:07] <megaTherion> leo: if I replace object with img, it works
[06:30:27] <manubaer> hi, i have some problemes to create a web-widget (not a ui-widget), here is a snippet of my widget: http://jsfiddle.net/L65kH/1/
[06:31:08] <manubaer> but the $.getJSON(,..) function will not executed
[06:31:13] <solidus-river> I SEE THERE IS A TRIGGER FUNCITON
[06:31:16] <solidus-river> :)
[06:31:20] <solidus-river> sorry, coffee
[06:31:46] <manubaer> within firefox i can see the return from http://exaple.de/ms/widget/data.js?callback=?, but i never see the alert
[06:31:55] <leo> @MegaTherion : Hope you'll find an other solution to make this work ;)
[06:31:57] <manubaer> what failes ?
[06:32:10] <megaTherion> leo: I did, Im using <img> now - dont care I just want to get that darn thing work
[06:32:25] <Vainoharhainen> Hm, is it not possible to do like this jQuery(this+' ul.li') ?
[06:32:38] <manubaer> with $.ajax(..) it will works, but not with dataType: 'json'
[06:32:59] <manubaer> but my json is valid..i have no clue
[06:33:07] <Ortund> http://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/374804_10150446289816560_717901559_9344692_1182806755_n.jpg   ... I'm looking at adding an edit for that expands out of each row here when I click on the article title, but I'm not quite sure how to do it
[06:33:35] <djangoobie> I have a absolute div which I want to hide when I click outside of it. But I can't manage to exclude it or it's children via not(). I tried $("body").not("#myDiv > *") as the selector. Anyone got some tips?
[06:34:22] <bonhoffer> i'm trying to figure out why my plugin is not loading at: http://s3752.at2.pressdns.com/
[06:34:49] <bonhoffer> i have this working on two other servers with identical code (at least supposed to be identical)
[06:34:58] <solidus-river> hmm
[06:34:59] <sphinxxx> anyone know if supersized plugin will work on animated gifs?
[06:35:05] <solidus-river> $('window').trigger('resize');
[06:35:07] <solidus-river> does not appear to be working
[06:35:07] <Ortund> bonhoffer how are we supposed to know where your plugin should be or what it is?
[06:35:15] <bonhoffer> but i'm getting an uncaught type plugin
[06:35:16] <stevefrost> djangoobie add a click event to the body to check if they clicked inside the div using .target()
[06:35:29] <bonhoffer> Ortund, it is the nivoslider, not my plugin
[06:35:32] <manubaer> nobody a hint about my widget ?
[06:35:46] <Ortund> the slideshow?
[06:35:46] <bonhoffer> Ortund, if you load that page it throws an exception
[06:36:10] <bonhoffer> yes -- right now i'm getting Object has no method 'nivoSlider'
[06:36:34] <djangoobie> stevefrost: Thanks I'll check it out
[06:36:44] <leo> @manubaer JsFiddle of your $.ajax please
[06:36:45] <bonhoffer> off of jQuery(window).load(function () {jQuery('#slider').nivoSlider({});
[06:37:19] <bonhoffer> i'm running in noconflict mode, which is new for me -- also now is not using document ready function
[06:37:26] <bonhoffer> i wonder if that is throwing me off
[06:37:38] <stevefrost> djangoobie .target not .target()
[06:37:43] <manubaer> @leo http://jsfiddle.net/L65kH/2/
[06:38:36] <manubaer> but it want work with dataType: 'json',.. i think i miss the callback.. but no idea how to do it.
[06:39:14] <djangoobie> stevefrost: thanks, i'll try it out
[06:40:12] <Ortund> bonhoffer: I don't see your <script> source to the nivoslider js file...
[06:40:24] <bonhoffer> oh, let me check, thanks
[06:40:38] <bonhoffer> http://www.crossfitadaptation.com/ <-- here it is working
[06:40:44] <bonhoffer> but i am moving servers
[06:40:49] <Ortund> oh wait, there it is
[06:41:33] <bonhoffer> yeah -- it is there
[06:41:37] <Ortund> but wait... why is your line jQuery('#slider')... ? Change it to $('#slider')
[06:42:07] <bonhoffer> Ortund, that was me following directions on the nivoslider setup page -- it said wp would be in 'no-conflict' mode
[06:42:08] <Ortund> maybe that's not the problem though... Just that I've never seen it done like you have it there
[06:42:30] <bonhoffer> it is working at www.crossfitadaptation.com
[06:42:33] <Ortund> well, try it with $
[06:42:43] <bonhoffer> will definitely do
[06:42:45] <Ortund> worst case scenario, it doesn't fix the problem...
[06:42:55] <manubaer> @leo an idea ?
[06:43:44] <leo> @manubaer happened to me but I can't remember the solution
[06:44:01] <bonhoffer> Ortund, true . . .
[06:44:09] <manubaer> is the data.js file correct ?
[06:44:33] <leo> @manubaer maybe it need others options (like POST or GET definition)
[06:44:58] <manubaer> the strange thing is, i see the result in firebug
[06:45:00] <bonhoffer> yeah, it produces: TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'nivoSlider'
[06:45:14] <bonhoffer> from: $('#slider').nivoSlider();
[06:45:25] <bonhoffer> which means the js pack for nivo slider must no be loading
[06:45:39] <djangoobie> stevefrost: How would one check if the target one clicked on, is not a child of the div I want to exclude?
[06:46:10] <leo> @manubaer yep but it's a String ?
[06:46:30] <bonhoffer> but i'm getting a successful get request from: http://s3752.at2.pressdns.com/wp-content/themes/crossfit_adaptation/jquery.nivo.slider.pack.js
[06:46:35] <gyzmodo> guys i've question
[06:46:37] <bonhoffer> so it is loading into the dom
[06:46:43] <manubaer> not in the json tab
[06:46:47] <gyzmodo> $(function(){ and $(document).ready(function(){
[06:47:02] <manubaer> http://alexmarandon.com/articles/web_widget_jquery/
[06:47:21] <gyzmodo> with what better i star writing jQuery?
[06:47:29] <manubaer> they wrapped the json in py
[06:47:29] <vargadanis> hello everyone!
[06:47:37] <gyzmodo> *start
[06:47:42] <manubaer> but i dont want to install python..
[06:47:59] <vargadanis> is it possible to register an event for all ajax request? a function to be executed when all ajax request starts and ends
[06:48:43] <vargadanis> http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/global-ajax-event-handlers/ maybe that O_o
[06:49:04] <solidus-river> where can i find a list of valid durations
[06:49:22] <bonhoffer> so the js pack is loading, but the a div isn't assigned the method of nivoSlider
[06:49:33] <bonhoffer> so maybe things are loading the wrong order
[06:50:18] <manubaer> okay, thanks for trying help,.. come back later
[06:50:20] <solidus-river> grr
[06:50:23] <solidus-river> is ther e a normal or something
[06:50:56] <fris> bonhoffer pastebin your code from your header.php and index.php or whever you are adding it
[06:51:11] <bonhoffer> fris, hey! will do
[06:51:47] <stevefrost> djangoobie $(e.target).parents('id of div').length;
[06:51:48] <bonhoffer> https://gist.github.com/1663501
[06:52:23] <stevefrost> djangoobie if length = 0 then it's not a child of that div
[06:53:34] <fris> bonhoffer got a live version?
[06:54:49] <djangoobie> stevefrost: Thanks man, you've helped me a lot
[06:54:53] <bonhoffer> yes -- www.crossfitadaptation.com works, http://s3752.at2.pressdns.com/ doesn't
[06:54:58] <stevefrost> np
[06:55:03] <bonhoffer> both are the exact same template
[06:55:12] <bonhoffer> which is why (or part of why) i'm confused
[06:57:13] <lilmikey> hi
[06:57:17] <Hooloovoork> yo
[06:58:05] <bonhoffer> fris, it is just hard to know what might be different
[06:58:08] <lilmikey> if I want to check if an element has a pseudoclass (:checked), should I just use hasClass(":checked")?
[06:58:26] <bonhoffer> i can see that the nivo slider is loading, it's methods are not available to jquery objects, though
[06:58:30] <leo> @lolmikey is(':checked') do the job
[06:58:37] <lilmikey> \leo thanks
[07:01:44] <bonhoffer> in general, what would cause Object [object Object] has no method
[07:03:04] <Vainoharhainen> Hi! hope someone can help me, i want to show an ul that contains a class. i tested to do like this but its not working hmm http://pastebin.com/8ETjwyzF its shows all my uls :S
[07:05:19] <Vainoharhainen> anyone knows what i do wrong?
[07:07:29] <Vainoharhainen> i think i solved it
[07:14:00] <Kzim> hi
[07:15:08] <Kzim> is it possible to have a autocompletion in a textarea ? and/or is it possible to highlight some words in a textarea ?
[07:17:39] <Pupeno_W> How do I match elements that have a certain data attribute?
[07:22:46] <mantas322> I have a page with a unique style css
[07:23:07] <mantas322> when i navigate to the page with the unique style, it doesnt acknowledge the style tag
[07:23:14] <lilmikey> I need to get a string from a class. say the class name is ff-something-mystring. is this correct: var myvar = $(this).attr("class") - "ff-something-";
[07:23:17] <mantas322> if i hit refresh, it does
[07:23:38] <mantas322> is there something I can add into the page that will tell it to load the page with ITS own style, instead of ignoring it for whatever reason
[07:24:19] <xec> Kzim: no easy way that i know of, you might want to google for some third party plugin. closest i found is in planning stage only; http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137993/ListBuilder
[07:27:43] <xec> mantas322: is this "page" loaded through ajax by chance?
[07:27:55] <mantas322> no
[07:28:05] <mantas322> there is however a query
[07:28:17] <mantas322> a cold fusion query that get the content from a database
[07:28:26] <xec> Pupeno_W: try something like $('[data-whatever="value"]')
[07:28:48] <xec> mantas322: is the site live somewhere?
[07:28:54] <Pupeno_W> xec: I don't have a specific value I want to match, just the presence of the attribute.
[07:29:12] <xec> Pupeno_W: ok, then just do $('[data-whatever]')
[07:29:22] <Pupeno_W> xec: I'll try it.
[07:29:34] <rue> CSS selectors. Learn them, love them.
[07:29:40] <mantas322> no, sorry its dev
[07:32:23] <xec> mantas322: if the browser does a refresh, and the style tag is present it should load. if the style tag is generated after page load i doubt it would work.
[07:32:41] <mantas322> I was thinking the same thing
[07:32:57] <mantas322> that maybe the content from the database is there AFTER the style is loaded
[07:33:01] <mantas322> and not the other way around
[07:33:09] <mantas322> or vice versa
[07:33:11] <mantas322> i donno
[07:33:14] <xec> coldfusion is server side only, though, right?
[07:33:19] <mantas322> yes
[07:33:27] <FinalAngel> is it save to use window.onload instead of jQuery('document').ready(); ?
[07:33:30] <mantas322> and it work soemtimes...
[07:35:11] <xec> mantas322:  so if it's loaded in coldfusion there shouldn't be a issue. can't say for sure without seeing the issue firsthand though, see ?demo
[07:35:12] <bot-t> mantas322, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:35:28] <xec> an*
[07:36:10] <lilmikey> I need to get a string from a class. say the class name is ff-something-mystring. is this correct: var myvar = $(this).attr("class").replace("ff-something-", "") ?
[07:36:15] <m0dmd> Aye what's going on everyone.
[07:36:43] <megaTherion> hmm how can I wait for an specific ajax query?
[07:36:51] <mantas322> xec, i will, and thanks for your interest.  not now though - im juggling several things at the moment
[07:36:51] <Flatfox> hello everybody
[07:37:22] <xec> lilmikey: what is the context? ...what is 'this' here
[07:37:31] <lilmikey> the element :)
[07:37:37] <lilmikey> it's like:
[07:38:11] <xec> ?axax101 @ megaTherion
[07:38:15] <bot-t> xec, Couldn't find "axax101" in jQuery Docs.
[07:38:17] <xec> ?ajax101 @ megaTherion
[07:38:17] <bot-t> megaTherion, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[07:38:46] <Flatfox> i am so sorry to ask this here...but I am a bloody beginner and studying on myself reading books about jquery....i got stuck in one selection, I just cannot figure out how to select it and so I ended up here to ask for help
[07:38:56] <lilmikey> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/kepet/
[07:39:15] <xec> Flatfox: what is your question? :)
[07:39:42] <Flatfox> it's about selecting all list items containing a link. (I feel so embassing)
[07:39:59] <megaTherion> xec: well Im using the success callback, it works good but I'm also calling another function off the document which is depending on the successful ajax call
[07:40:04] <xec> lilmikey: is that code inside something else? i still don't know what "this" is
[07:40:30] <Flatfox> and add a class to the sibling list items that follow the selected ones
[07:40:37] <lilmikey> xec: updated http://jsfiddle.net/kepet/1/
[07:40:54] <lilmikey> xec: isn't $(this) the input element?
[07:41:12] <xec> megaTherion: what do you mean by "off the page"
[07:41:14] <lilmikey> the one with the class :checked
[07:41:53] <Flatfox> i tried it with .next().addClass(); but nothing happened so I thought my selector must be wrong
[07:42:04] <danner> i'm using .ajax(), and the request is being cancelled and resubmitted non-ajaxy immediately. why would this happen? someone said leaving off a trailing '/' might make it redirect, but mine has that.
[07:42:26] <xec> lilmikey: i don't see why it would be... could you also add some markup to your demo? also, select jquery from the framework dropdown at the left
[07:43:13] <xec> ?has @ Flatfox
[07:43:13] <bot-t> Flatfox, .has(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[07:44:12] <xec> Flatfox: is that what you want? for "selecting all list items containing a link"
[07:44:32] <lilmikey> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/kepet/2/
[07:45:58] <xec> lilmikey: an if statement is not going to change what "this" is - do a console.log(this) to check.
[07:46:11] <xec> lilmikey: what was this code supposed to do, change a class name?
[07:46:16] <lilmikey> yea
[07:46:37] <lilmikey> what would you recommend?
[07:46:59] <lilmikey> i think that going with an if statement wasnt the best idea
[07:47:26] <Flatfox> not sure...this is the task:
[07:47:27] <xec> lilmikey: it looks like a difficult way to solve a problem. what do you want to achieve
[07:47:28] <Flatfox> Select all of the list items (<li>s) containing a link (<a>). Add the class afterlink to the sibling list items that follow the ones selected.
[07:47:34] <Flatfox> i wrote
[07:47:46] <Flatfox> now with your help
[07:47:48] <Flatfox> 	$('li').has('a').next().addClass(afterlink);
[07:47:54] <Flatfox> not sure if it is right
[07:48:04] <xec> close
[07:48:11] <Flatfox> error console tells me afterlink is not defined :o
[07:48:11] <xec> ?nextall @ Flatfox
[07:48:11] <bot-t> Flatfox, .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[07:48:30] <xec> Flatfox: quote it, like .addClass("afterlink")
[07:49:11] <xec> Flatfox: or single quotes if you prefer, for consistency
[07:50:26] <Flatfox> so now it says:   	$('li').has('a').next().addClass('afterlink');
[07:50:39] <Flatfox> sorry
[07:50:43] <Flatfox> nextAll
[07:51:23] <xec> cool.
[07:51:27] <xec> does it work?
[07:53:07] <Flatfox> well...again not sure
[07:53:20] <Flatfox> the css for the afterlink is li.afterlink {
[07:53:21] <Flatfox>   border-right: 4px solid #090;
[07:53:23] <Flatfox> }
[07:53:53] <xec> Flatfox: could you whip up a quick demo, see ?demo
[07:53:54] <bot-t> Flatfox, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:53:58] <Flatfox> after changing the code with your help i get weird green lines (should be the border) on the right of the page
[07:54:29] <Flatfox> maybe it should be like that
[07:55:33] <solidus-river> how would i overwrite a plugins function through jquery?
[07:55:57] <solidus-river> well.. not overwrite but append
[07:56:04] <solidus-river> is there a way? or should i just edit the source
[07:56:15] <xec> Flatfox: yes, iirc LI is block level
[07:57:08] <subdesign> hi, is it possible to call a ui dialog inside a ui dialog?
[07:58:05] <Alex82> does anyone use datatables?
[07:58:14] <Flatfox> http://jsfiddle.net/hc9fw/     is that right?
[07:59:04] <FinalAngel> did anyone have already the problem that chrome just wont display the correct container height?
[07:59:23] <Hooloovoork> FinalAngel: show me a jsfiddle of the problem
[07:59:42] <Flatfox> and again...the task is: Select all of the list items (<li>s) containing a link (<a>). Add the class afterlink to the sibling list items that follow the ones selected.
[08:00:15] <megaTherion> xec: sorry I was on the phone, by off the page I mean $(document.read()...
[08:00:17] <megaTherion> +y
[08:00:24] <Flatfox> but something tells me, that this green borders should not look like that!?
[08:00:42] <FinalAngel> there is no code to show, it's basically that if I use $('img').height(), it would sow 0. Had this problems also multiple times with cycle… taught anyone knows about that behaviour
[08:01:50] <Hooloovoork> FinalAngel: that should not happen, but if you have a code example where it happens someone might know what's wrong.
[08:01:53] <FinalAngel> setTimout fixes the problem, but still, I hate jQuery...
[08:02:02] <Funi> anyone free to give me some help?
[08:02:39] <Hooloovoork> Funi: just ask away and someone will (probably) answer
[08:03:43] <xec> Flatfox: it looks right to me, what did you expect
[08:03:44] <Funi> I'm getting an unexpected Token error for "]" when i try parse some JSON layed out like so:
[08:03:44] <Funi> {"Setup":[

[08:03:58] <xec> yay for spam
[08:04:00] <NoiseEee> Funi: never paste that stuff in channel please
[08:04:17] <Hooloovoork> FinalAngel: it sounds like the dom hasn't loaded properly. it's not jquerys fault. try using $("el").get(0).height instead. if that returns 0 it's not a jquery bug.
[08:04:18] <Funi> you said to ask... :(
[08:04:33] <Funi> and i assume code examples do help
[08:04:37] <xec> Funi: there are pastebins for multiple lines
[08:04:38] <Hooloovoork> Funi: ...
[08:04:45] <Hooloovoork> ?jsfiddle @ Funi
[08:04:45] <bot-t> Funi, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[08:04:49] <Funi> sorry
[08:05:07] <xec> Funi: don't worry, we were all new once ;)
[08:05:08] <FinalAngel> kay im trying
[08:05:20] <Hooloovoork> Funi: you need to close the first array there.
[08:05:38] <Hooloovoork> Funi: no wait that's not it
[08:05:42] <Hooloovoork> fun a sec
[08:05:54] <Funi> what?
[08:06:40] <Flatfox> xec: hm...thought, that the border may appear at the first <li> items after the link and then again after the next one....and also not in more layers
[08:06:56] <FinalAngel> it returns undefined
[08:07:03] <Flatfox> maybe i am just a little bit stupid
[08:07:07] <Flatfox> dunno
[08:07:10] <Flatfox> ^^
[08:07:45] <Flatfox> so you would say this is the way how to solve this? or is there also some alternative?
[08:08:21] <thebrettster> hey all.
[08:08:28] <Funi> I have an AJAX request from which i format the reply as i pasted above but the Jquery.parseJSON doesnt seem the like the multiple "]" i have going on
[08:08:29] <thebrettster> need some help with the jquery slideup function
[08:08:54] <xec> Flatfox: well, let's try a simple version first.. does this do what you expect? http://jsfiddle.net/hc9fw/1/
[08:08:58] <bonhoffer> still struggling why why the nivoSlider method isn't attaching to the DOM, http://s3752.at2.pressdns.com/
[08:09:05] <bonhoffer> this is working on localhost and another server
[08:09:11] <thebrettster> basically
[08:09:13] <Hooloovoork> Funi: that works for me...
[08:09:15] <thebrettster> i have like 6 images
[08:09:21] <thebrettster> creating a header
[08:09:32] <thebrettster> client wants each element to slide up the page
[08:09:33] <Hooloovoork> Funi: you sure the json looks exactly like that when you get it from the server?
[08:09:50] <thebrettster> obviously with individual delay on all the elements
[08:10:06] <thebrettster> any clue on the best method to do this?
[08:10:32] <Hooloovoork> FinalAngel: so you have a working example? isn't it faster to make a fiddle of it so we can solve it for you?
[08:10:43] <Hooloovoork> FinalAngel: we can't do anything if we can't see the problem.
[08:10:46] <Funi> Hooloovoork: I thought it did, ill check again
[08:10:59] <Hooloovoork> Funi: just get the server response
[08:11:14] <Hooloovoork> Funi: that's sure to be exactly what the server gives you =)
[08:13:00] <hashpuppy> using $.ajax.  let's say there is some error on that ajax function, like the user tries to use an ajax function on an object that no longer exists, i want to alert the user that the object they are trying to update has been already deleted.  how should I do this?  return a 500 and error text?  or return data: {errorText: "object has already been deleted"} and check for that in the success handler?
[08:13:05] <Flatfox> when reading the code I expected something different, but when crosschecking the html i think I got it in this case and can say, yes it does what i should expect ;)
[08:13:23] <bonhoffer> it looks like wordpress is forcing my script tags into the head, would that do it
[08:13:25] <Flatfox> xec: when reading the code I expected something different, but when crosschecking the html i think I got it in this case and can say, yes it does what i should expect ;)
[08:13:35] <bonhoffer> otherwise -- i had my script in the middle of the page
[08:13:54] <Hooloovoork> hashpuppy: do it the way you prefer. catching a server error in ajax is messy though.
[08:14:01] <bonhoffer> in general, why put content in the head versus footer?
[08:14:10] <hashpuppy> ok
[08:14:11] <hashpuppy> thanks
[08:14:18] <xec> Flatfox: ok, does this do what you expect? :) http://jsfiddle.net/hc9fw/2/
[08:14:24] <FinalAngel> Hooloovoork yeah well to reproduce the code, moved it from sass to css, encapsule the html, than im better off with the timeout...
[08:15:15] <solidus-river> is there a way to check if the mouse is currently in an area?
[08:15:40] <lilmikey> xec: sorry dude im making dinner :)
[08:15:46] <bonhoffer> so i include the nivo slider pack at the beginning of the header, but by the end of the header, $("#slider).nivoSlider(); shows that $("#slider") has not method nivoSlider
[08:16:03] <xec> lilmikey: don't worry, i'm off soon too
[08:16:11] <lilmikey> xec: i want to toggle additional class on elements
[08:16:29] <Flatfox> xec: not at all! now I get a feeling you want to show me something, because now even the last example makes no sense anymore :)
[08:16:33] <lilmikey> that share a string from a classname from an element that sometimes gets :checked
[08:16:56] <lilmikey> I want the trigger to be the input element getting class :checked
[08:18:02] <xec> Flatfox: well, you have nested lists. every top level LI has an A element somewhere beneath it, and since we are selecting all the toplevel lists, everything is bold
[08:18:18] <xec> Flatfox: which is the same reason you get more borders than you expect
[08:18:38] <xec> (i assume)
[08:18:42] <FinalAngel> Hooloovoork: $(window).load() seems to work
[08:19:04] <Flatfox> xec: but how does that make sense with your first example? the color?
[08:19:19] <Flatfox> xec: shouldn't it be also all green actually?
[08:19:30] <ilteris_> hey guys, how hard is it to build such an app like polyvore? http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/app Does anyone have any experience building such?
[08:19:34] <xec> Flatfox: no, you have a color set on li on the css
[08:19:51] <Funi> Hooloovoork: No i have a trailing comma at the end just before the "]" that needs to be fixed and i assume thats why its giving me that error
[08:20:38] <bonhoffer> or in general, how do i get nivoSlider to attach to the dom
[08:20:50] <bonhoffer> i included the nivo.slider.pack.js -- shouldn't that do it?
[08:21:13] <aikInsaan> anyone know of a place I can make an http post from....just to test if my server is responding correctly
[08:21:22] <aikInsaan> I could just write my own...but if it already exists....
[08:21:37] <Flatfox> it would really be a big relief if everybody could tell me that in the beginning all of you were a bit confused like I am at the moment
[08:22:37] <thang> hell im still confused
[08:22:43] <Flatfox> thx :D
[08:22:52] <bonhoffer> it is odd that the error comes from trying to retrieve  the method, not from loading the method
[08:23:08] <xec> Flatfox: this has more to do with css than jquery.. added font-weight property to li in css: http://jsfiddle.net/hc9fw/2/
[08:23:16] <xec> make sense?
[08:23:23] <aikInsaan> anyone know of a place I can make an http post from....just to test if my server is responding correctly
[08:23:54] <bonhoffer> is there a way to load a script in the chrome console, effectively type: <script src="jquery.nivo.slider.pack.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[08:23:59] <bonhoffer> in the console
[08:24:09] <xec> Flatfox: but you can see the comedies, tragedies and histories are still selected
[08:25:59] <Flatfox> xec: and that is, because we have .has('a') right? so it overrides only this words
[08:26:29] <Flatfox> xec: and henry iv wo has an <a> included
[08:27:19] <xec> Flatfox: yes, it looks down the tree to see if theres any link underneath any li, which there is under all those. i suspect you might only want to select the closest parent li to each link, am i right?
[08:28:00] <xec> Flatfox: in which case you can use .closest() to look upwards instead; http://jsfiddle.net/hc9fw/3/
[08:28:50] <fuchstronaut> salut!
[08:28:56] <burg> hello. on this jquery ui example : http://79.112.36.235/drag/ -- you should be able to drag items from first col into the third col. yet the third col gets its hoverclass when dragged items are on second col, and dragged items can only be dropped on second col
[08:30:38] <bonhoffer> so i have <script src="foo.js" type="text/javascript"></script> in my head -- the page loads without error, but it doesn't look like this ran -- i can force it to load via console, through document.body.appendChild(s) where s is a script element that loads foo.js
[08:30:52] <bonhoffer> any idea what could be going on?
[08:31:28] <xec> bonhoffer: any errors in console?
[08:31:34] <bonhoffer> none
[08:31:48] <bonhoffer> except if i try to access a method that should be loaded by foo.js
[08:32:06] <bonhoffer> for example, $("#slider").nivoSlider(); shows that the method doesn't exist
[08:32:20] <bonhoffer> unless i load it via document.body.appendChild(s)
[08:32:42] <xec> bonhoffer: and nivoSlider is defined in foo.js?
[08:32:47] <bonhoffer> this works on two other sites, i wonder if this webserver is doing something odd
[08:32:55] <bonhoffer> yes, foo.js is nivo.slider.pack.js
[08:33:14] <bonhoffer> http://s3752.at2.pressdns.com/ <-- error is live here
[08:33:20] <bonhoffer> the loader just spins
[08:33:32] <Flavius1924> hi guys!
[08:33:38] <burg> any idea why is this happening?
[08:33:59] <bonhoffer> but it is clear that the pack is not loading, but not throwing a console error
[08:34:05] <sphinxxx> i have an ajax GET request that fetches an xml file, my network tab is showing it's a 200 (success), however i'm not reaching the success function
[08:34:19] <diverdude> What is the best practice to make a chatwindow which is always docked in the bottom of the screen no matter if the page is longer than the screen?
[08:35:09] <aleray> hi, i'm lazy loading html snippets with associated js libraries and scripts using ajax, problem is the javascript gets triggered before the dom is ready
[08:35:15] <aleray> how could I solve this?
[08:35:16] <Flavius1924> i get this error http://screencast.com/t/VDnuY5seo0Zl here http://screencast.com/t/dpkskrxXh i have the source code if you want,here it is http://dpaste.com/692373/
[08:35:38] <bonhoffer> xec, any theories appreciated, i'm at a loss
[08:36:00] <Flatfox> xec: the new things makes more sense to me....and i think that I begin to understand the whole thing better....
[08:36:14] <xec> bonhoffer: ye taking a look, but my firefox won't let me view source for some reason -.-
[08:36:22] <bonhoffer> hmm.  . .
[08:36:39] <Misiur> Is jQuery internally grouping events?
[08:36:44] <bonhoffer> i'm looking in chrome tools and can view the source
[08:37:33] <Flatfox> xec: in that way, if the task is as follows:  Add the class tragedy to the closest ancestor <ul> of any .pdf link.       may I be right, when writing it this way? http://jsfiddle.net/hc9fw/
[08:38:04] <xec> Flatfox: hit update and post the new url ;)
[08:38:25] <xec> that's your original fiddle
[08:38:31] <bonhoffer> https://gist.github.com/1664148 <-- xec, this works . . .
[08:38:32] <Flatfox> sry;)
[08:38:34] <Flatfox> http://jsfiddle.net/red_flatnak/hc9fw/4/
[08:38:41] <bonhoffer> if i type that in the dev toolbar
[08:39:00] <bonhoffer> load the slider pack and append to the document.body
[08:39:08] <bonhoffer> then it appears perfectly
[08:39:27] <xec> Flatfox: yes that looks about right to me
[08:39:36] <Flavius1924> anyone knows what does this error means ?
[08:39:40] <Flatfox> xec: great!
[08:39:42] <Flatfox> wow
[08:39:44] <Flatfox> hehe
[08:39:44] <sphinxxx> ajax request getting 200 but not going to success function, i don't get it?  no console errors
[08:40:13] <Flatfox> xec: so in a way i have to think from behind, so to speak, right?
[08:40:37] <Flatfox> xec: we write the last things first
[08:40:51] <xec> Flatfox: yes, if you only want to match a single parent, it's better to move up the tree
[08:41:21] <Anime> var $img = $("<img />").wrap(document.createElement("li")); <- is this wrong in anyway? took it from an example directly from the jquery docs but the li never appears :-|
[08:41:28] <Anime> any way*
[08:42:13] <Flatfox> xec: thank you soo much for your time and patience...your links give again enough material to think about and understand better....just thanks!
[08:42:39] <xec> Flatfox: my pleasure :)
[08:43:26] <Flavius1924> xec,u think u can help me please ?
[08:43:33] <xec> bonhoffer: i'm as confused as you at the moment, i think
[08:43:38] <bonhoffer> :)
[08:43:47] <bonhoffer> not good news . . .
[08:43:58] <Flavius1924> i have this error and i don't have any idea what it is
[08:43:59] <bonhoffer> page.ly (the host is doing something strange) i have a host ticket with them
[08:44:06] <Flavius1924> http://screencast.com/t/VDnuY5seo0Zl
[08:44:28] <sphinxxx> you can't have "&" in an xml tag?
[08:44:33] <sphinxxx> that seems to be breaking it
[08:44:44] <sphinxxx> like <title> this & that</title>
[08:44:56] <xec> sphinxxx: yes you need &amp; in xml
[08:45:52] <sphinxxx> xec, thanks that worked
[08:46:09] <thebrettster> Could someone take a look at this and modify for me?
[08:46:10] <thebrettster> http://jsfiddle.net/nnyqA/1/
[08:46:19] <thebrettster> or point me in the right direction
[08:47:25] <nFFFFF> thebrettster
[08:47:26] <nFFFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/nnyqA/3/
[08:47:32] <nFFFFF> you didn't select jQuery from left side
[08:47:34] <nFFFFF> :)
[08:47:55] <xec> nFFFFF: but he did include it manually ;)
[08:48:31] <nFFFFF> Didnt even see that :)
[08:48:48] <xec> Flavius1924: is your site live somewhere?
[08:49:16] <thebrettster> not currently, hence why I
[08:49:21] <thebrettster> m using example divs
[08:49:25] <thebrettster> sorry about that
[08:49:46] <Flavius1924> xec,thanks for your help,but i got the problem fixed :)
[08:50:18] <xec> Flavius1924: good :)
[08:50:32] <xec> thebrettster: http://jsfiddle.net/nnyqA/4/ something like that?
[08:51:14] <Funi> is there an easy way to stop the trailing comma when generating JSON?
[08:51:18] <xec> thebrettster: $(function(){..code..}) is just short for $(document).ready(function(){..code..})
[08:51:57] <thebrettster> Yes, something like that
[08:52:09] <thebrettster> except the images will need to slide up from the bottom
[08:52:13] <Eviltwin> Funi: Yes, use JSON.stringify
[08:52:29] <Eviltwin> If you're asking for a language other than JavaScript, ask in the channel for that language
[08:52:37] <xec> thebrettster: you can fix that with css - position: absolute; bottom: 0;
[08:53:12] <thebrettster> thank you :)
[08:53:37] <jeffsmykil> anyone see anything wrong with this?   if ((parseInt(lowTimeOnlySplit, 10) + i)) > 13) {
[08:53:44] <jeffsmykil> its saying i have a bad expression
[08:54:05] <jeffsmykil> or expecting an expression
[08:54:08] <jeffsmykil> pointing to the >
[08:54:11] <Eviltwin> ()'s and {'s don't match
[08:54:36] <Eviltwin> But I think you just didn't share the }
[08:54:52] <jeffsmykil> yeah i didnt
[08:55:09] <xec> an extra ) after i ?
[08:55:10] <Eviltwin> So then count your ('s and )'s
[08:55:21] <thebrettster> xec so in short if i had a header div i would give that a position of relative then all of the individual elements i wanted to slide up would get a position absolute and they would slide up from the header div - NOT from the entire page, correct?
[08:55:29] <jeffsmykil> good call xec
[08:55:30] <jeffsmykil> and Eviltwin
[08:56:01] <xec> thebrettster: correct!
[08:56:11] <thebrettster> thank you
[08:58:49] <cybersholt> anybody here awesome @ Datatables im havin a hell of a time with updating a row / record
[08:59:27] <cybersholt> i can make a fiddle if anyone is interested
[09:05:34] <aleray> hi, i'm lazy loading html snippets with associated js libraries and scripts using ajax, problem is the javascript gets triggered before the dom is ready
[09:05:35] <aleray> how could I solve this?
[09:06:34] <Flatfox> xec: may i bother one more time about the css function?
[09:07:39] <jantalg> aleray: use event .ready() - http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[09:08:02] <cybersholt> aleray u can also use ajax success
[09:09:16] <aleray> jantalg, ready is just for the first page init ?
[09:09:30] <min|dvir|us> http://jsfiddle.net/GWkx4/
[09:09:46] <min|dvir|us> This code works here but does not work on a similar test page.
[09:09:57] <min|dvir|us> Everything works except for the background-image which does not load.
[09:09:58] <Flatfox> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/hc9fw/1/  could you once more explain why only the comedies, tragedies, histories and henry iv are selected and made green?
[09:11:25] <diverdude> I am trying to vertical-align all elements to the bottom like this: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/107797507 but still the elements are v-aligned in the top. What am I missing?
[09:11:27] <aikInsaan> anyone know of a place I can make an http post from....just to test if my server is responding correctly
[09:12:18] <min|dvir|us> Anyone?
[09:12:48] <Flatfox> does it mean, that anytime we select i.e. $('li') it is always the top list item?
[09:14:37] <NoiseEee> Flatfox: $('li') = all <li>s
[09:15:42] <aleray> cybersholt, right I think it works now... thanks
[09:16:08] <cybersholt> no problem there are also other functions too i would check the docs :)
[09:16:50] <cybersholt> anybody got a sec to help with updating a row in Data tables ? http://jsfiddle.net/cybersholt/QWYR4/
[09:18:09] <thebrettster> @xec how can I manipulate the css in the jquery for the show or slideDown functions
[09:18:16] <Flatfox> xec: never mind, i think i got it, thx
[09:20:31] <thebrettster> for example, if the css starts with the element having an element of 0
[09:21:06] <thebrettster> having a position of 0 i mean
[09:21:19] <thebrettster> how can I get it to go to a position of 20 for example
[09:21:20] <burg> if a droppable can accept elements from more than one lists, how can i know where the dropped element was from?
[09:21:23] <thebrettster> kind of have a tween effect
[09:25:24] <cybersholt> someone got a sec to help with updating a row in Data tables ? http://jsfiddle.net/cybersholt/QWYR4/
[09:31:20] <NoiseEee> burg: http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/ -> events -> drop.   "In the callback, $(this) represents the droppable the draggable is dropped on. ui.draggable represents the draggable.".  so, ui.draggable will have the reference somewhere.
[09:33:16] <xckpd7> can I get some implementation help? jsfiddle.net/a8cRv/ & jsfiddle.net/a8cRv/1/
[09:33:49] <xckpd7> I'm basically running into an issue where I have to duplicate stuff, and I'm trying to think of a DRY way to go about it
[09:38:56] <thebrettster> http://jsfiddle.net/nnyqA/9/
[09:39:06] <thebrettster> need some help ith that again
[09:39:31] <thebrettster> how can I get the div to go from having a position of 0px to 60px;
[09:39:39] <thebrettster> and create a transition
[09:39:44] <thebrettster> more then just the moving
[09:39:45] <thebrettster> http://jsfiddle.net/nnyqA/9/
[09:41:28] <thebrettster> i guess a motion tween
[09:41:30] <thebrettster> ?
[09:42:03] <Mullie> How can I check if focus was caused by click?
[09:43:23] <NoiseEee> Mullie: it really matters?  people who focus via tabbing don't get the same event?
[09:43:50] <Mullie> NoiseEee: Like if I click on the input-field or if I call input.focus();
[09:45:49] <NoiseEee> Mullie: if it really matters (and I cant see why it would or should) you'd only get 'click' from assigning a click event to the field
[09:48:02] <Mullie> NoiseEee: I want in the focus-handler see if click did trigger the focus-event or something else..
[09:48:23] <NoiseEee> Mullie: not possible, and again... extremely odd.
[09:51:26] <Mullie> NoiseEee: ok
[09:53:09] <cybersholt> god  virgin mobile sucksssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

[09:57:53] <red_square> VictorCL wrap it in a div then do html, outerhtml coming in the next version I think
[09:58:04] <VictorCL> :(
[09:58:56] <cybersholt> yea u could do <div><div id=cont>cont</></> then do parent of cont
[09:59:07] <cybersholt> that should do it
[09:59:39] <alexr2> is there any way to attach a hook to elements that don't exist yet?  I'm dynamically inserting elements, but want them to be hooked to the hover jquery event as soon as they're inserted
[10:00:06] <anchovy> ?on @ alexr2
[10:00:06] <bot-t> alexr2, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:00:21] <alexr2> Thank you
[10:00:56] <|PiP|> how can i add an element to a select list right before the last element?
[10:00:58] <fg-> api.jquery.com down?
[10:01:04] <alexr2> yeah, i can't access it
[10:01:05] <alexr2> haha
[10:01:12] <mdpatrick> Is it possible to submit a form element via ajax? I.e. I want to take a normal form and submit it, but display the returned data on the page somewhere instead of changing the pages.
[10:01:30] <red_square> ? .serialize @ mdpatrick
[10:01:31] <bot-t> mdpatrick, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[10:01:36] <anchovy> the jquery api website is down, try a cached version
[10:01:41] <mdpatrick> will do
[10:01:44] <mdpatrick> thanks, red_square
[10:01:53] <red_square> np
[10:02:11] <muzone> At https://gist.github.com/1657796 - how to get JS to change the text_field to collection_select if Spree has a list of states for the current country?
[10:02:13] <Anime> http://api.jquery.com/append/ - says here I can call append with an array of DOM objects, any idea why this http://jsfiddle.net/ygJU7/ doesn't work while calling append twice, first with $a then with $b does?
[10:02:16] <fg-> http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/api.jquery.com yes
[10:02:21] <fg-> np
[10:02:27] <fg-> using cached ver. from google
[10:02:48] <alexr2> Anime, leave the $'s off
[10:02:52] <mdpatrick> red_square: Ok I could then use this as a GET with query string, can I still use for POST?????
[10:02:54] <alexr2> those are for php, not javascript
[10:02:54] <mdpatrick> somehow?
[10:02:58] <Anime> hm
[10:03:03] <red_square> yes mdpatrick
[10:03:17] <Anime> i read somewhere its nice to use those to indicate they're objects and not plain vars
[10:03:57] <mdpatrick> red_square: How do you do that?? Do you just set type to POST and concatenate query string onto the end of the URL????
[10:03:57] <anchovy> there's nothing wrong with using a $ sign to assign variables
[10:04:02] <anchovy> Anime, you're right
[10:04:07] <alexr2> *shrug*
[10:04:21] <red_square> mdpatrick $.post('url', $form.serialize())
[10:04:48] <red_square> assuming $form is a jq object containing a form:)
[10:05:17] <mdpatrick> red_square: beautiful!!! you rock, thanks :)
[10:05:22] <red_square> np
[10:06:07] <Anime> so, anchovy, you know why that doesn't work? - cached since its down: http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:9wRXx0H0IHoJ:api.jquery.com/append/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk / Additional Arguments section
[10:06:10] <anchovy> Anime, try var $wrap = $("<div />").append($a, $b);
[10:07:18] <Anime> i actually need to pass an array because it conflicts with another function arguments
[10:07:43] <anchovy> you can't, .append() takes additional elements as separate arguments
[10:08:01] <obfuscatr> if I have a function foo(), can't I just do $('.something.').change(foo())  ?
[10:08:19] <anchovy> Anime, maybe use try $("<div />").append($a).append($b);
[10:08:31] <Anime> $('body').append($newdiv1, [newdiv2, existingdiv1]); <- jquery site is wrong? :(
[10:08:49] <ldiamond> is it just me or the documentation is down?
[10:08:49] <anchovy> the [ ] means the arguments are optional
[10:08:59] <anchovy> you don't literally add those in your function call
[10:09:06] <Anime> Supported input includes DOM elements, jQuery objects, HTML strings, and arrays of DOM elements.
[10:09:16] <anchovy> obfuscatr, get rid of the (), $('.something.').change(foo)
[10:09:30] <Anime> ldiamond, use a cached version
[10:10:13] <ldiamond> so, should I assume it's not just me?
[10:10:25] <Anime> it is down.
[10:10:31] <thebrettster> ello
[10:10:41] <thebrettster> how to do i set the timeout on a function in jquuery
[10:10:48] <thebrettster> specifically the slideDown function
[10:11:07] <px12> you dont set as timeout function in jquery.. you do it with plain simple js
[10:11:33] <anchovy> Anime, http://jsfiddle.net/ygJU7/1/
[10:11:42] <px12> jquery is a library which gives you extra functions you can work with via js.. its not a programming language.
[10:11:51] <anchovy> ?slideDown @ thebrettster
[10:11:51] <bot-t> thebrettster, .slideDown([duration], [callback]): Display the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
[10:11:52] <Anime> i can't use it that way...
[10:11:55] <anchovy> rtfm
[10:12:06] <anchovy> Anime, then chain your .append() calls
[10:12:10] <thebrettster> i know how to set the speed
[10:12:12] <thebrettster> just not the delay
[10:12:39] <anchovy> ?g javascript setTimeout @ thebrettster
[10:12:40] <bot-t> thebrettster, JavaScript Timing Events - http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp
[10:13:45] <Zzaichik> .delay()
[10:14:43] <anchovy> that works too
[10:14:46] <thebrettster> like this
[10:14:46] <thebrettster> http://jsfiddle.net/nnyqA/11/
[10:15:33] <px12> alright.. .delay should do the trick for you.
[10:16:05] <thebrettster> so the way i did it was correct?
[10:16:24] <CodeZombie> could someone take a look at this for me? I've put my question, and my scopes into a gist, since it's a pretty long question. https://gist.github.com/e77cbc76865e91c40a58
[10:19:09] <red_square> CodeZombie you know this is a jquery chan
[10:19:17] <CodeZombie> ha
[10:19:18] <CodeZombie> oops
[10:19:21] <CodeZombie> sorry about that guys
[10:19:25] <red_square> :)
[10:19:33] <CodeZombie> must've mis clicked
[10:19:35] <min|dvir|us> http://jsfiddle.net/GWkx4/ works fine. Similar code on my page works fine as well but the background-image does not show.
[10:19:39] <CodeZombie> so many open channels
[10:20:03] <CodeZombie> thanks for pointing that out red_square: I would've been waiting forever
[10:20:42] <alexr2> anchovy, jquery on works only if the element already exists... i need a way to call it once, and then not worry about it as i dynamically add elements
[10:22:57] <alexr2> err welp, nm
[10:23:10] <alexr2> it does work
[10:23:29] <raj> can someone tell me why when selecting one of the autocomplete results, the autocomplete box pops up for a second time...then when selecting an item the second time, the item is input as expected? typing the letter J into the Company inputbox should make this clear: http://68.44.194.145:8080/asdf/edit-profile?section=occupation
[10:25:01] <red_square> raj, the focus goes back to the input causing it to open again
[10:25:31] <raj> red_square, but close: function is supposed to prevent that by setting closing=true
[10:26:06] <red_square> what happens if you take out the other focus event u have
[10:26:22] <raj> i only have 1
[10:26:48] <red_square> hm, your not setting the ui closing
[10:26:52] <red_square> just a random variable
[10:27:12] <raj> huh?
[10:27:29] <red_square> well you create your own closing variable
[10:27:34] <raj> oh, yes
[10:27:41] <raj> and I declared it up top
[10:27:46] <raj> var closing = false;
[10:27:52] <red_square> yeh I see:)
[10:27:53] <raj> and then I set it to true
[10:28:55] <afidegnum> hello,
[10:29:31] <red_square> raj, remove that and the focus event
[10:29:48] <mantas322> is the Idea behind jquery that you only load the jquery.js once?
[10:29:56] <red_square> yes
[10:30:03] <afidegnum> let's say I have a background picture i.e, a landscape mostly png, jpeg, png, and so on...... another picture is my picture with transparent background......  is there a way to use jquery to drop one picture on top of another one ?
[10:30:19] <mantas322> and when u navigate to a diff page from the page referencing the .js it comes with it
[10:30:26] <mantas322> however what if u wanna go to the second page directly
[10:30:31] <raj> red_square, done
[10:30:42] <mantas322> does this go against the jquery way
[10:30:43] <mantas322> ?
[10:30:47] <raj> oh wait
[10:30:48] <raj> no
[10:30:49] <raj> not done
[10:31:06] <red_square> mantas322 dont get you
[10:31:22] <mantas322> okay so I have an initial page, which has a link to page 2
[10:31:32] <mantas322> initial page references jquery.js
[10:31:36] <red_square> raj - now it works
[10:31:39] <raj> red_square, k, I'm not sure if you were looking at the updated versioni before red_square, I just restarted my server so it'd reflect the latest version
[10:31:49] <mantas322> if I go to page 2 from initial page, I dont have to reference the .js
[10:31:55] <red_square> mantas322 you do
[10:31:56] <mantas322> since its still "with" me
[10:32:06] <red_square> it isnt if its a full get request
[10:32:21] <Zzaichik> still should reference it though
[10:32:22] <raj> red_square, it still doesn't work
[10:32:39] <raj> it pops the results box back up after selecting any of the items
[10:32:40] <mantas322> so ur saying that both the initial page and page 2 need this in <script src="../js/jquery-1.6.3.min.js"></script>
[10:32:48] <red_square> yes
[10:32:55] <raj> then when you select an item again, then it actually puts it in the inputbox like it should
[10:32:59] <mantas322> okay, thanks
[10:33:01] <mantas322> for now...
[10:33:30] <mantas322> hmmm
[10:33:36] <red_square> raj it still has the focus code in it
[10:33:44] <mantas322> css unique to page 2 istill gets ignorekd unless i refresh
[10:33:45] <mantas322> :/
[10:34:25] <raj> red_square, oh, I should mention that I have that in there on purpose
[10:34:38] <raj> I want the results to show up when a textbox has focus
[10:34:44] <raj> instead of just onkeypress
[10:35:20] <raj> so taking away the focus code would defeat the purpose
[10:36:28] <red_square> raj - does the focus fire before or after the close event?
[10:36:38] <red_square> can u add console.logs in both of those events
[10:36:44] <red_square> so we can see the sequence
[10:38:10] <raj> red_square, http://68.44.194.145:8080/asdf/edit-profile?section=occupation
[10:38:13] <red_square> raj - see the issue
[10:39:28] <raj> k, so it's re-focusing when I select an item
[10:39:35] <raj> before thinking it closed
[10:39:39] <red_square> yeah, focus is called before close
[10:39:44] <raj> what's the solution?
[10:40:22] <red_square> raj - in the select event - set closing maybe
[10:40:48] <red_square> but you also need to reset it when they blur
[10:41:20] <red_square> raj - can you not use the autocomplete( "option", "autoFocus" ); option
[10:41:54] <raj> are you asking or saying?
[10:42:00] <raj> oh, you're asking
[10:42:07] <red_square> well asking why you are not!
[10:42:10] <raj> autoFocus just selects the first item automatically
[10:42:25] <raj> or highlights it, I should say
[10:42:31] <raj> nothing to do with focus event
[10:42:32] <red_square> oh right
[10:42:50] <red_square> ok so use the select event rather than close to do your than
[10:42:55] <red_square> thing
[10:42:55] <raj> you're like the gajjilionth person to say that though :)
[10:43:08] <red_square> ha, I dont use the ui
[10:43:22] <red_square> autoFocus is a bad name for it
[10:44:15] <Faerris> Hey everyone! Question for you: I have a block of social "follow" buttons that are slowing down the load time of my site. I'd like to place that code in a JS file and I'm wondering how best to do that? The code has some JS already in it.
[10:44:22] <raj> focus runs before selected as well
[10:44:39] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone i have a rather expert question on jquery so i thought step by here to consult you guys ;)
[10:44:41] <mantas322> so anyone else run into css isues with jquery?
[10:44:52] <jarr0dsz> i have some box in css i toggle 2 states  expanded and collapsed
[10:44:52] <mantas322> it seems that my page gets created and the css gets ignored
[10:44:59] <mantas322> untill i refresh
[10:45:01] <mantas322> wierd....
[10:45:06] <jarr0dsz> worked on it last week. but then someone suggested use of window states, that would make it cleaner
[10:45:29] <jarr0dsz> could i have 2 states, and toggle between them to make a box expand and collapse and also set properties inside the expanded box?
[10:45:59] <red_square> raj - ok set it in open event
[10:46:09] <red_square> remove it on close
[10:46:28] <red_square> if close is guranteed to be called
[10:48:15] <raj> red_square, but I think the point is .focus runs before any of autocomplete's events
[10:48:27] <red_square> well it wont be run before open
[10:48:53] <red_square> if you set it on open, remove on close the focus happens in between
[10:49:05] <mantas322> is there something I can add to my page that will tell it to ACKNOWLEDGE MY CSS!
[10:49:24] <red_square> the correct url mantas322
[10:50:19] <mantas322> harumph
[10:50:51] <raj> red_square, brilliant that sorta works
[10:50:56] <raj> :)
[10:51:34] <raj> red_square, only thing is, the focus event never works again !
[10:51:37] <raj> hehe
[10:51:38] <mantas322> MAYBE!
[10:51:42] <mantas322> i can do this....
[10:51:51] <mantas322> no, no i cant do that
[10:52:07] <mantas322> I dont even know what to blame, css, coldfusion, or stupid jquery files
[10:52:52] <red_square> raj - it does, I move of the field and back to it and I get the autocomplete
[10:52:56] <raj> nm, solved that by setting close: closing = false
[10:52:58] <raj> ironically
[10:53:18] <raj> red_square, sorry, you were looking at the old version
[10:53:23] <raj> i updated the server
[10:53:35] <raj> but now it's working due to closing = false within close:
[10:53:46] <raj> i can switch it back to true if you wanna see
[10:53:55] <red_square> great, no its ok
[10:54:01] <raj> =P
[10:54:07] <raj> thank you for helping red_square
[10:54:16] <red_square> np
[11:02:03] <sector119> Hello. If I call e.preventDefault() to prevent some event how can I resume/trigger that event?
[11:02:30] <mantas322> hey so general question
[11:02:48] <mantas322> anyone know a good open source javascript Autocomplete TextBox ?????
[11:02:54] <mantas322> besides the one on code-project
[11:03:03] <mantas322> beep me if you know of any good ones
[11:03:06] <mantas322> thanks
[11:07:09] <ilteris_> sector119: I guess you have to call the event manually, then?
[11:08:47] <sector119> ilteris_: how to do that? If I do not know wtat that event should to do...
[11:09:13] <NoiseEee> sector119: well what are you stopping?  submit event of a form?  location change of an <a href> ?
[11:12:56] <sector119> NoiseEee: location change, but I do not want to make it manually like location.href = $(selector).attr('href') ... Is it possible to make it automaticaly?
[11:14:42] <NoiseEee> sector119: why?
[11:15:08] <NoiseEee> make it automatically?  if you're passing the <a> tag, then it would just be location.href = this.attr('href');
[11:16:15] <sector119> What if some there is some function call on link click?
[11:16:30] <NoiseEee> sector119: pastebin a code example.
[11:18:11] <obfuscatr> if $(".foo")[0]  returns <span class="foo" id="blah">...</span>  , why can't I do $(".foo")[0].attr("id")  ? returns 'no method attr'
[11:19:05] <min|dvir|us> obfuscatr: $('.foo')[0] is not a jQuery object.
[11:19:13] <min|dvir|us> It is a native DOM element.
[11:19:25] <min|dvir|us> Use .get().
[11:20:10] <NoiseEee> or $('.foo').eq(0)
[11:20:47] <obfuscatr> ah, thanks
[11:22:53] <a|i> is jqeury compatible with closure library advanced optiomization mode yet?
[11:24:23] <wookiehangover> a|i: I'm not sure, but I can tell you that uglify js is the preferred minification tool
[11:24:47] <wookiehangover> the project moved away from the closure compiler about 18 months ago
[11:31:02] <Jon47> does anybody know a good resource for looking up all the native DOM query api methods (ie, .querySelectorAll, .getElementById, etc.. etc..)
[11:31:34] <mantas322> where can I find "jquery.ui.base.css"     "jquery.ui.theme.css"
[11:31:44] <mantas322> ???
[11:36:23] <henn1nk> hello guys. i have a jquery grayscale script.. for local images everything is fine. for images located on a different server i receive a security error. is there a way to fix this?
[11:36:46] <min|dvir|us> Hey guys.
[11:38:16] <min|dvir|us> http://jsfiddle.net/GWkx4/ works fine. I have similar code that works fine as well, except in all browsers but Fx, the backgroundImage doesn't load.
[11:38:20] <min|dvir|us> Any thoughts?
[11:48:35] <alexr2> is there a selector i can use to get the parent class?  (not the .parent() method please)
[11:49:31] <Zzaichik> .parents();  ;p
[11:49:37] <Zzaichik> just kidding
[11:49:54] <alexr2> :parent doesn't seem to work
[11:50:04] <Eviltwin> alexr2: What's the use case?
[11:50:08] <Eviltwin> What are you trying to accomplish?
[11:50:30] <sphinxxx> .attr('class')
[11:50:36] <alexr2> $("body").on("hover",".sentiment_bar:parent",      function(event) {
[11:51:00] <Eviltwin> alexr2: No, I mean what are you trying to accomplish?
[11:51:35] <alexr2> get hover to work on the parent class of an element.  the parent class doesn't have any type of identifier and moves around
[11:51:38] <Zzaichik> attr('class);  ?
[11:52:08] <Eviltwin> alexr2: Can you make a jsFiddle? I'm not quite sure I follow
[11:52:10] <NoiseEee> alexr2: you're going to have to get the parent from within the function, not as a "selector" of your "on"
[11:52:40] <Eviltwin> the :parent pseudo-selector filters for elements that are parents (i.e. contain elements)
[11:52:45] <alexr2> mouseover for that won't work though.  it'll only work once i mouseover the inner element that i have an id for
[11:52:47] <alexr2> right?
[11:52:56] <alexr2> rather mouseenter
[11:52:58] <Eviltwin> Can you make a jsFiddle?
[11:53:12] <Zzaichik> Si, si - jsFiddle it up
[11:53:14] <alexr2> Yes
[11:53:16] <alexr2> Hold on
[12:00:11] <alexr2> http://jsfiddle.net/j6y5B/
[12:00:27] <alexr2> I want to be able to catch that event once I enter a td, rather than when I enter the span
[12:01:19] <Eviltwin> Oh, then you want this: http://jsfiddle.net/j6y5B/1/
[12:01:33] <alexr2> ah! perfect
[12:01:34] <alexr2> thank you

[12:15:32] <eddiemonge> wtf is that?
[12:15:51] <Eviltwin> Why are you linking us a bunch of ruby?
[12:16:01] <NivenHuH> do you have to manually trigger a change event if you're programmatically changing the value?    http://jsfiddle.net/Yghp7/
[12:16:08] <Eviltwin> NivenHuH: .change()
[12:16:25] <NivenHuH> right.. do you need to explicitly call that after setting .val()
[12:16:26] <NivenHuH> ?
[12:16:40] <Eviltwin> Typically, yes
[12:16:44] <NivenHuH> ok.. thanks
[12:16:48] <Eviltwin> Actually I think you do in all cases
[12:16:57] <Eviltwin> Otherwise if you changed on change, you'd end up in an infinite loop
[12:17:03] <Eviltwin> Also, don't use .live, ever
[12:17:06] <Eviltwin> It's deprecated
[12:17:08] <NivenHuH> yeah, i'm using .on now
[12:17:09] <Eviltwin> Look at .delegate and .on
[12:17:23] <NivenHuH> i was being sloppy on jsfiddle
[12:18:38] <NivenHuH> i wonder why they decided to not have the browser trigger a change event implicitly?
[12:18:48] <NivenHuH> sorry.. "they" being the royal they.. lol
[12:21:15] <djangoobie> I'm using qTip which automatically appends absolute positioned tooltips in the body. The problem I get is that I have a container element, which is bound by a mouseleave event, fires the event when you hover over the tooltip. Anyone got tips on how to deal with this?
[12:21:25] <muzone> At that Gist - I'm trying to simplify the top ERB, and I'm wondering if JS / jQuery can it?
[12:21:30] <Flatfox> it belongs to this example:   $('#switcher').click(function(event) {
[12:21:32] <Flatfox>        if ($(event.target).is('button')) {
[12:21:32] <andrew9183> when i do find("div:not('foo')") -- is foo case sensitive ?
[12:21:33] <muzone> * can do it?
[12:21:34] <Flatfox>          var bodyClass = event.target.id.split('-')[1];
[12:21:35] <eddiemonge> NivenHuH: because there are times when you dont want to trigger it so its up to the dev to trigger it
[12:21:49] <red_square> ? paste @ Flatfox
[12:21:50] <bot-t> Flatfox, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:22:04] <eddiemonge> muzone: simplify how?
[12:22:20] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: Uh... :not takes a selector
[12:22:20] <eddiemonge> Flatfox: ok and? i told you what it was
[12:22:23] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[12:22:47] <Flatfox> sorry for pasting it wrong....
[12:23:34] <Flatfox> i am very new to all of this....my question is, if this is already enough to be directed to let's say 3 buttons?
[12:24:02] <walla> regex help, getting only 2 matchings instead of 3 http://jsfiddle.net/yFGcG/
[12:24:34] <Flatfox> it was an example i folled along and i understood everything until the moment the var appeared and the .target.id.split('-')[1]..and no further explanation....it just confused me
[12:25:11] <red_square> Flatfox - its just taking the right hand side of the id after the hyphen
[12:25:25] <red_square> of the clicked element
[12:25:57] <red_square> so an id of "button-123" would give you 123 in the var
[12:26:32] <eddiemonge> walla: have you tried doing: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/yFGcG/1/
[12:26:33] <walla> trying to do a simple regex, but not getting the third match => http://jsfiddle.net/yFGcG/
[12:26:45] <walla> i will try that addiemonge
[12:26:46] <walla> thanks
[12:27:04] <muzone> eddiemonge: well the state_elements thing especially
[12:27:24] <Flatfox> now I am stuck and don't understand, sorry for that
[12:27:33] <muzone> eddiemonge: you can see previous attempts to simplify it failed: https://gist.github.com/1660803
[12:27:41] <muzone> im hoping this one though will do!
[12:28:02] <walla> eddiemonge there still is no 3rd match in /1/
[12:28:03] <Eviltwin> muzone: You do know you're in #jquery, not #ruby, right?
[12:28:08] <eddiemonge> muzone: why dont you put what output you are hoping to get at jsfiddle since i dont speak ruby
[12:28:37] <eddiemonge> walla: fullList has 4 elements. one is empty
[12:28:45] <muzone> cool, coming right up
[12:29:32] <muzone> Eviltwin: was kinda hoping y'all could see past the ruby hehe
[12:30:04] <walla> eddiemonge but fullParsed has only 2 matches instead of 3
[12:30:18] <walla> i meant fullListParsed eddiemonge
[12:30:34] <walla> how do i make it match all 3 of them
[12:30:40] <eddiemonge> walla: it actually only has 1 match
[12:30:53] <Flatfox> red_square: so does that mean, that I would need to use 3 lines of code for each button i have?
[12:30:59] <eddiemonge> as seen by fullListParsed.length === 1
[12:31:08] <eddiemonge> Flatfox: what are you trying to do?
[12:31:39] <Flatfox> eddiemonge: i am trying to understand jquery....I just started learning
[12:31:51] <tash> I've got a jqui modal form working in IE, but I can't seem to figure out why it doesn't work in FF. Can someone lend me a hand?
[12:32:04] <red_square> ? demo @ tash
[12:32:05] <bot-t> tash, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:32:08] <walla> eddiemonge oh, ok, hmm...
[12:34:14] <walla> eddiemonge thanks man, i got terribly confused there, needed a second eye
[12:44:07] <supsup> anyone know why it says callback is not defined?  http://jsfiddle.net/PhBGj/2/
[12:44:57] <supsup> opps wrong version of jquery -- same problem http://jsfiddle.net/PhBGj/3/
[12:45:05] <Flatfox> http://jsfiddle.net/red_flatnak/MJkpx/   this is the code I am trying to understand...as I understood it is the more developed code of this : http://jsfiddle.net/red_flatnak/MJkpx/1/  which I could follow along....but then it kicked me out....
[12:50:47] <eric357> how do I see the label of a checkbox?  I need to know if it says "None" but  val() gives an error and .checked is boolean so I know it's checked but don't know what it says
[12:51:02] <NoiseEee> label of a checkbox?
[12:51:35] <fris> im using getjson, what would be the best way to set the div the class is <div class="box2"> for the first post, box for the2nd box for the 3rd, and box3 for the 4th entry
[12:51:45] <supsup> prob means value
[12:51:46] <lilmikey> I want to trigger an event when an element gets a class. should I use an 'if' statement?
[12:51:58] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[12:52:05] <Eviltwin> Maybe?
[12:52:29] <supsup> heh.
[12:52:31] <eric357> NoiseEee: I say "label" but I meant value
[12:53:01] <lilmikey> what would be the alternatives?
[12:53:07] <eddiemonge> supsup:  http://jsfiddle.net/PhBGj/6/
[12:53:09] <NoiseEee> eric357: i guess first you need to tell us/figure out why .val() gives an error
[12:53:15] <eddiemonge> supsup:  http://jsfiddle.net/PhBGj/7/
[12:53:26] <supsup> o jsfiddle scope
[12:53:28] <supsup> nice
[12:53:38] <lilmikey> maybe.. when
[12:53:40] <supsup> thanks eddie ~
[12:54:24] <supsup> how would i call this with a callback? http://jsfiddle.net/PhBGj/8/
[12:54:33] <eric357> Specific error is:  Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLInputElement> has no method 'val'
[12:54:35] <supsup> how would i call this function with a callback*
[12:55:03] <NoiseEee> eric357: so it seems you haven't made the checkbox a jquery object... pastebin code sample
[12:55:04] <eddiemonge> supsup: the showMyVideos is the callback
[12:55:09] <eric357> just a minute while I place the code snippet somewhere
[12:55:15] <eric357> NoiseEee: right
[12:55:38] <supsup> eddiemonge how do you call a callback that is part of an another functions scope non-global scope?
[12:55:43] <supsup> or do all callbacks have to be global?
[12:56:13] <eddiemonge> supsup: you could look at see ? getScript
[12:56:13] <bot-t> supsup, jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[12:56:23] <eddiemonge> supsup: although for jsonp its different
[12:56:37] <supsup> ok i will take a look
[12:56:53] <lilmikey> http://jsfiddle.net/kepet/2/
[12:57:28] <lilmikey> I am trying to give a class to an element that includes a string from a class name from an input element, when that input element gets checked
[12:59:01] <Eviltwin> Was that english?
[12:59:02] <eric357> NoiseEee: code fragment here: http://jsfiddle.net/cNHYv/
[12:59:59] <NoiseEee> eric357: yeah in that case you need to elem = $(elem); before you use it
[13:01:17] <eric357> NoiseEee: I'll try that...
[13:01:17] <lilmikey> Eviltwin, which part of the statement didn't you understand?
[13:01:53] <Eviltwin> lilmikey: Try rephrasing it and/or using specific examples
[13:02:30] <hobbelt> Could someone give me some directions on a good way to incorporate a selectbox with an input box in table row filtering? Example here: http://jsfiddle.net/2xFBJ/6/
[13:03:07] <FFForever> Is it possible to update the uri location without actually changing the browser location
[13:03:09] <lilmikey> when an input element gets the pseudoclass ":checked", I want to addClass to another element. The class I want to add is derived from a class name that the input element already has
[13:03:19] <NoiseEee> FFForever: only the hash
[13:03:27] <NoiseEee> FFForever: ie: #slide1
[13:03:29] <eTiger13> hobbelt: you mean like an autocomplete box?
[13:03:29] <lilmikey> so the input element has the class "ff-selector-type-radio"
[13:03:35] <eric357> NoiseEee: oh wow, that worked like a magic charm... guess I've got some learnin' to do!  Thanks
[13:03:42] <FFForever> NoiseEee, That's what I thought.
[13:03:53] <lilmikey> hmm, actually...
[13:03:54] <hobbelt> eTiger13 no, a select box. Like two different inputs on filtering a table pulled from the database
[13:03:57] <lilmikey> rephrase.
[13:04:02] <NoiseEee> FFForever: lest you come to my site and i change the URL to www.yourbank.com and all ;)
[13:04:07] <eTiger13> FFForever: dont be an evil person
[13:04:30] <FFForever> eTiger13, How would I be an evil person?
[13:04:40] <eTiger13> hobbelt: you mean update the select box based on the text input box?
[13:05:07] <FFForever> I just wanted to change the filename open (not the domain)
[13:05:10] <hobbelt> eTiger13, no i have a large table pulled from the database. Based on the Selectbox input, or the text box input, or both i want to hide rows
[13:05:23] <hobbelt> I can do one, but combining.
[13:05:46] <lilmikey> There is an input element with a class "ff-selector-type-myclass". there is also another element with a class "myclass". now I want to give the latter element an addition class "active", when the input gets checked (gets the pseudoclass ":checked")
[13:06:46] <lilmikey> there are of course multiple input elements and corresponding elements of other type, sharing a string in the class name. thats why I want to pass it in a function.
[13:11:16] <eTiger13> hobbelt: http://jsfiddle.net/2xFBJ/7/
[13:13:28] <hobbelt> eTiger13 thats what i tried as well, but it doesnt allow you to reselect, or do both. Like input and selectbox
[13:26:10] <eTiger13> hobbelt: http://jsfiddle.net/2xFBJ/10/
[13:27:02] <sirtwist> Trying to figure out a problem I'm having with focusout ... anyone around that has seen it cause a page to drop a click?
[13:27:39] <sirtwist> If I click a link or button on the page while in a textbox with a focusout event handler the handler fires but the click never hits the button or link.
[13:28:16] <sirtwist> I'm sure it's something stupid ... I just can't see what it is, though, LOL.
[13:28:23] <NoiseEee> sirtwist: jsfiddle please
[13:28:54] <hobbelt> eTiger13 that looks interesting :)
[13:29:14] <PKKid2> Is there a jquery event I can use that gets triggered when the element is added to the DOM?
[13:29:36] <eTiger13> hobbelt: http://jsfiddle.net/2xFBJ/11/ done. see ? boom
[13:29:36] <bot-t> hobbelt, "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[13:30:07] <sirtwist> NoiseEee: Working on it ... sorry, haven't used jsfiddle before.
[13:30:08] <eTiger13> PKKid2: yeah, the callback where you add the element to the dom
[13:30:47] <PKKid2> eTiger13, The problem is I am using Highcharts (JS plotting library), and I dont have access to the location where they add the elements to the DOM.
[13:31:07] <hobbelt> eTiger13 thanks :)
[13:31:20] <PKKid2> eTiger13, at least not without major surgery to a very large library that I do not maintain.
[13:31:21] <hobbelt> eTiger13 i think this is a great base i can extend :)
[13:31:32] <eTiger13> i accept most praise and donations
[13:31:54] <eTiger13> PKKid2: what are you looking to do specifically?
[13:32:15] <PKKid2> I was hoping to do something like "$('selector').live('WHEN_ADDED_TO_DOM', myfunction)"
[13:32:26] <megaTherion> is it possible to make fadeIn blocking?
[13:33:40] <PKKid2> eTiger13, Basically I want to add qTip tooltips to the legend items on Highchart charts.  The problem is even when loading qTip at the end of the HTML file, the chart is still not done filling in all the bits of its chart and the legend items I want to attach to are not yert in the DOM.
[13:34:03] <Eviltwin> First things first, never use .live
[13:34:04] <Eviltwin> It's deprecated
[13:34:10] <Eviltwin> Use .delegate or .on instead
[13:34:24] <PKKid2> Eviltwin, ok, good to know thanks.
[13:34:39] <Eviltwin> And there aren't events you can bind to for DOM mutations in all browsers because it becomes a performance nightmare
[13:34:57] <Eviltwin> When one of the events causes an mutation that causes a mutation
[13:35:08] <PKKid2> Thats what I was kindafiguring when running through this in my head. :(
[13:35:50] <PKKid2> perhaps, I can write a little wait function that looks for my elemets, then calls setInterval() if they are not yet there?
[13:36:27] <Eviltwin> It's better to use custom events for larger modifications
[13:36:41] <PKKid2> that seems a bit wrnog too thog, and lends itself torace conditions ;-/
[13:36:44] <Eviltwin> Like you add the new elements and then .trigger("mymods");
[13:36:54] <Eviltwin> Then you have a .bind("mymods", function() { ... })
[13:36:58] <eTiger13> PKKid2: have you looked at highcharts to see if it has a callback for this type of situation?
[13:36:59] <PKKid2> thats the problem, im not adding the elements
[13:37:14] <Eviltwin> Who/what is?
[13:37:19] <PKKid2> eTiger13, yea, I dont see one.
[13:37:33] <eTiger13> PKKid2: im about 50% certain it does
[13:39:11] <PKKid2> looking again.. not looking like there is one
[13:39:31] <PKKid2> ehh, I might have one
[13:40:03] <PKKid2> eTiger13, Thanks, I'm gonig to try this gaain.. A second closer look shows "chart.events.load" might be what I was looking for.
[13:41:35] <brettster> hey
[13:44:21] <sirtwist99> NoiseEee: http://jsfiddle.net/nmENZ/
[13:44:50] <sirtwist99> If you click the Bing link it won't take the click ... it loses the focus and hides the div properly, but you have to click the link a second time for it to work.
[13:46:30] <PKKid2> eTiger13, Thanks again for setting me on the right path; It's working great now. :)
[13:46:44] <NoiseEee> sirtwist99: i think its more an issue of the click happening where the link just WAS, ie: its moving.. if you catch it on the move it works
[13:46:58] <sirtwist99> Yeah
[13:47:15] <sirtwist99> I think you're right ... not sure what to do about it, though. :( Maybe put a delay on hiding the div?
[13:47:37] <NoiseEee> sirtwist99: kinda the way a link works... you don't actually go to a new href until you release the mouse button... by the time you've released it (in most cases with your example) you're no longer over the <a>
[13:47:55] <NoiseEee> sirtwist99: you could put a 'click' listener on the <a> tag, feels kind of gross but will probably 'work'
[13:48:08] <NoiseEee> or mousedown, iirc "click" is the same thing (really mouseup?)
[13:48:23] <sirtwist99> Hrm ... okay, I'll play with it. Thanks!
[13:50:41] <BinaryMaster> Question: http://jsfiddle.net/6y4bD/  I have an animation I'm working on that should move one box off and put another on the code is at the jsfiddle url given can some one tell me what I'm doing wrong please?
[13:52:17] <PilotBob> if I change the data-val-* attributes on an element. How can I get jQuery validation to re-read and use those new values?
[13:52:23] <fission6> can someone help me , i have a click handler on an id, i want to unbind the handler once its received and then rebind it once a few ajax calls are done, so i can ignore any clicks in between
[13:53:04] <funkymonk> fission6: show us some code
[13:53:42] <eTiger13> fission6: set a flag that gets toggled in the in click
[13:53:50] <lilmikey> can someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong: http://jsfiddle.net/
[13:53:51] <lilmikey> lol
[13:53:57] <lilmikey> http://jsfiddle.net/37yf4/
[13:54:06] <funkymonk> eTiger13: good suggestion
[13:54:38] <eTiger13> lilmikey: what are you trying to do? hide those inputs?
[13:54:59] <lilmikey> trying to hide the body element.
[13:55:03] <lilmikey> this is just a test
[13:55:09] <andrew9183> the selector is :checked, isnt it ?
[13:55:21] <eTiger13> hide the body element????
[13:55:26] <NoiseEee> PilotBob: what is jquery validation?
[13:55:32] <lilmikey> this is just a test.
[13:56:05] <BinaryMaster> http://jsfiddle.net/6y4bD/ trying to move box left out of visible range and bring new box into view at end but it gets fubar somewhere can someone please help
[13:56:05] <lilmikey> andrew9183: strangely, it doesn't say so in firebug, although when I click it, the box does get checked.
[13:56:41] <eTiger13> lilmikey: how about start with your problem and we can suggest some solutions
[13:56:41] <DOMENICO> BEN ALMAN
[13:56:51] <PilotBob> NoiseEee: the validation plugin.
[13:57:11] <lilmikey> eTiger13: sure. I have checkboxes. they have a class name "something-myclass"
[13:57:34] <PilotBob> lilmikey: I usually use .is(":checked") But... when is this running? You shouldn't need the $.each.
[13:57:43] <lilmikey> they sometimes get checked. when they do, I want other elements with the class "myclass"
[13:58:05] <lilmikey> PilotBob: how should I trigger the function?
[13:58:27] <PilotBob> lilmikey: do you want it to tigger when a checkbox is clicked?
[13:58:30] <lilmikey> they sometimes get checked. when they do, I want other elements with the class "myclass"
[13:58:32] <andrew9183> lilmikey: so whenever an input is checked, you want to hide the body ?
[13:58:51] <lilmikey> to get an additional class name
[13:58:56] <NoiseEee> PilotBob: never used it, but presumably after you change it you could $(form).validate() again?
[13:59:08] <lilmikey> no, not really, I am just trying to make it work - thought hiding the body would be a good test.
[13:59:15] <PilotBob> lilmikey: $("element").change(function () { $(this).is(":checked") blah blah })
[13:59:25] <fission6> hwo do i access vars inside $(document).ready(function() { ..... }); form the javascript console
[13:59:40] <eTiger13> console.log()
[13:59:41] <lilmikey> PilotBob: Ill check that out.
[13:59:48] <fission6> no i want to reach in and see a var
[13:59:52] <fission6> how do i namespace
[14:00:16] <andrew9183> huh?
[14:00:20] <NoiseEee> fission6: $(document).ready(function() { .....; debugger; });
[14:00:30] <jhardy1974> I need help with drag/drop function I am creating. I have 10 icons, each needs to fire off a specific modal once they are droped in place. Can anyone help?
[14:01:10] <fission6> no, sorry i am looking to properly namespace the code
[14:01:44] <PilotBob> NoiseEee: no.. that doesn't seem to re-read the rules from the attributes.
[14:04:24] <NoiseEee> PilotBob: ahh drag. generally i'm a fan of roll-yr-own validation :(
[14:05:12] <fission6> i have code inside jquery.ready() there must be a way to namespace the code so i can acces vars and functions inside of it
[14:05:24] <tbranyen> When you set an ajaxPrefilter how would you stop your code from continually adding more to the stack if you weren't sure if you set them already or not?
[14:05:30] <tbranyen> Do you think setting a flag on the jQuery namespace is acceptable?
[14:05:54] <danzik17> why wouldn't you be sure it was added yet?
[14:06:00] <PilotBob> NoiseEee: yes, but this is nicely meshed with asp.net MVC. Just this one place I need to change the rules based on another. I was hoping to avoid doing a rules remove and then add.
[14:06:05] <tbranyen> how would you check that danzik17 ?
[14:06:17] <tbranyen> if its in a constructor function that can get initialized many times
[14:06:27] <tbranyen> i can't just set a flag, since there are multiple unique instances
[14:06:33] <PhonicUK> how do I remove all handlers from an event?
[14:06:33] <lilmikey> http://jsfiddle.net/37yf4/1/ what about this?
[14:06:48] <danzik17> tbranyen: in whatever module that has that constructor, why not wrap it in an IFFE, set the prefilter, and return the constructor from the iife
[14:06:53] <danzik17> that way its only ever done once
[14:06:54] <NoiseEee> PilotBob: it's bound to the form?
[14:07:27] <tbranyen> danzik17: thats not a terrible idea, i'd rather only setting it if i use the constructor... but this might work fine
[14:08:58] <NoiseEee> PilotBob: see if http://snippets.aktagon.com/snippets/490-How-to-add-and-remove-validation-rules-jQuery-validate-plugin- or http://stackoverflow.com/questions/363268/how-do-i-remove-jquery-validation-from-a-form offer anything that may help...
[14:09:43] <fission6> this has to be simpler than i am making it, maybe i shouldn't use an anonmous function to pass into .ready()
[14:13:46] <lilmikey> are class names case-sensitive in jquery?
[14:13:58] <BinaryMaster> how can 3 +1 = 31
[14:14:10] <tbranyen> BinaryMaster: one of those is a string
[14:14:11] <NoiseEee> BinaryMaster: concatenation
[14:14:15] <alexr2> parseInt
[14:14:18] <BinaryMaster> aaaahhhh
[14:14:33] <BinaryMaster> how do I type cast
[14:14:45] <alexr2> parseInt(variable)
[14:14:51] <BinaryMaster> ty
[14:15:02] <NoiseEee> ^^ dont forget the radix.   parseInt(var,10)
[14:19:02] <PilotBob> NoiseEee: ah, it looks like the data- elements are read by MS customer unobstrusive js stuff and I have to use it's parse method.
[14:21:29] <NoiseEee> ahh, good times PilotBob
[14:23:28] <someprimetime> can return false be used in place of e.stopPropagation() ?
[14:24:34] <NoiseEee> not unless whatever is calling the function is expecting true to continue, someprimetime.... sounds like you're mixing inline JS and unobtrusive JS
[14:25:01] <someprimetime> NoiseEee: nope i'm not doing that at all
[14:25:10] <someprimetime> but thanks
[14:25:42] <someprimetime> i understand stopPropagation() is used to prevent dom bubbling from occurring, but can someone give me a good example in practice?
[14:27:05] <NoiseEee> well, let's say you have a 'click' listener on a <div> that contains an <a> tag.  your <a> tag should run a specific function on click, but should not call the function associated with the <div>
[14:27:28] <NoiseEee> so in the function that <a> is calling, stopPropagation() will prevent the <div> handler from running
[14:28:06] <BinaryMaster> if I want to find out how many li's are in a ul list would this work var iTotalListItems = $('ul').find('li').count();
[14:28:25] <someprimetime> ahhhhh
[14:28:28] <someprimetime> makes sense
[14:28:38] <someprimetime> thanks
[14:28:39] <NoiseEee> BinaryMaster: i think you're looking for .length instead of .count()
[14:28:52] <someprimetime> BinaryMaster: i think you could do ul.size()
[14:28:52] <NoiseEee> np someprimetime
[14:28:59] <Vainoharhainen> Hm, is it possible to get module data from template? I use count to check if its enabled but i need to check so its return anything?
[14:29:01] <BinaryMaster> aaahhh okay thank you
[14:29:02] <someprimetime> $('ul').find('li').size();
[14:29:04] <Vainoharhainen> But i cant find any function.
[14:29:08] <Vainoharhainen> Wups wrong chan :D
[14:29:59] <BinaryMaster> length or length()?
[14:30:39] <NoiseEee> BinaryMaster: its not a function, so .length
[14:31:46] <someprimetime> ?size @ BinaryMaster
[14:31:46] <bot-t> BinaryMaster, .size(): Return the number of elements in the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/size/
[14:35:46] <PilotBob> So is using data("hello") not the same as using attr("data-hello") ??

[14:38:53] <stew-a> is there any way with jquery mobile (or without for that matter) to get mobile browser "mousedown" and "mousemove" events to behave like they do on a regular browser? I want to make something draggable but i can't see any way to have it work, swipe isn't really what i'm looking for.
[14:41:38] <ibodi> $('#id').click(function(){$.get('http://a.com');alert(1);}) works --- however when i delete "alert(1)" it does not work. .error() said error
[14:42:16] <ibodi> very similar to this guy: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6880182/jquery-post-only-works-when-some-function-executed-after-it
[14:42:23] <GoGoGarrett> http://pastebin.com/pTdcTfhC  any reason why line 6-7 shouldn't be working?  I'm trying to clear the values to an empty set if the "no" is selected in the form
[14:42:33] <ibodi> any ideas ? coldhead
[14:43:06] <ibodi> coldhead: hi~ :)
[14:43:54] <coldhead> that's very weird ibodi
[14:44:05] <coldhead> it could be something weird with data string
[14:44:13] <coldhead> it could be something weird with your global ajax settings
[14:44:24] <coldhead> i would get out my debugger and have a close look
[14:44:31] <coldhead> see if the post fires at all
[14:44:36] <coldhead> try running it from the console
[14:44:39] <coldhead> and so on
[14:45:04] <ibodi> coldhead: exactly same result as .post
[14:45:45] <ibodi> coldhead: as i try to log a click , so no callback need , just send a post/get
[14:45:55] <coldhead> do you have a live demo of this somewhere ibodi ?
[14:46:36] <coldhead> GoGoGarrett: does it work better if you change line 5 to just } else { ?
[14:46:49] <coldhead> or does that not work with your html?
[14:47:50] <GoGoGarrett> well it works either way
[14:48:00] <GoGoGarrett> but there's a few check boxes so I figured it be better to be more specific
[14:48:17] <coldhead> except where it doesn't work >: P
[14:48:23] <GoGoGarrett> well even with it gone
[14:48:24] <GoGoGarrett> still doesn't work
[14:48:28] <GoGoGarrett> with just the simple else {
[14:48:31] <GoGoGarrett> =\
[14:48:37] <coldhead> oh also line 7 isn't going to do anything
[14:48:46] <coldhead> it returns the value of the '' attribute
[14:48:52] <coldhead> and there shouldn't be such a thing
[14:49:35] <GoGoGarrett> http://www.electrictoolbox.com/jquery-clear-form/
[14:50:00] <GoGoGarrett> just trying to mimic their this.val '' basically
[14:50:45] <coldhead> but you don't want to just use val('') ?
[14:50:52] <coldhead> that's not what you need?
[14:51:07] <coldhead> if you want to clear a specific attribute
[14:51:18] <GoGoGarrett> yeah, I just want to clear all the values if no is selected
[14:51:30] <coldhead> so use .val('')!
[14:51:34] <coldhead> that should work
[14:51:45] <coldhead> if you want to remove an attr see ?removeattr

[14:54:34] <ibodi> coldhead: post to an external domain.
[14:55:15] <ibodi> coldhead: i tested on some page in same directory same domain, only works when alert() is there.
[14:55:51] <coldhead> you can't post() to an external domain

[15:03:45] <paissad> hello guys, i would like to know wether or not it is necessary to have javascript skills in order to create javascript components ...  ? .. i mean, does a single knowledge of JQuery sufficient for creating an Analog Clock for example
[15:03:51] <PilotBob> coldhead: thanks
[15:04:31] <paissad> i would like to avoid learning ajax/javascript .... :/ (i could learn them for having some basics, but not for been experimented)
[15:04:45] <Guest23174> Hello
[15:04:49] <coldhead> no one here will try to talk you out of learning JS, paissad
[15:05:08] <coldhead> you can try your luck without it but you'll do a better job if you know the fundamentals
[15:05:23] <larzen-wrk> question.. how do I invoke a click() event on a jQuery object that I had queried using the jQuery('li
[15:05:24] <paissad> coldhead, yep of course
[15:05:25] <larzen-wrk> function.
[15:05:46] <larzen-wrk> i tried jQuery('
[15:05:47] <coldhead> GoGoGarrett: $(this).val('')
[15:05:55] <coldhead> i don't understand why you're not using that
[15:05:59] <coldhead> i must be missing something
[15:06:13] <larzen-wrk> jQuery(jQuery('li')[0]).click() <-- doesnt work.
[15:06:22] <coldhead> paissad: don't tell anyone i told you but you can get a pretty good distance without much knowledge
[15:06:31] <coldhead> it's when you run into trouble that you'll hurt
[15:07:47] <coldhead> larzen-wrk: the two options should be $('li').click() to run the event handler and $('li')[0].click() to run the native method
[15:07:58] <coldhead> substitute jQuery for $ as desired
[15:08:37] <Advocated> Hi there, im using jquery, and am using it on buttons etc etc and the styling is being applied ok, with jquery UI, the thing is, my divs look plain and boring, can i somehow apply jquery css to them, so they're glossy or whatever? Can't find anything on the net about it..
[15:09:10] <larzen-wrk> ahh ok!
[15:09:15] <PilotBob> so that's explains why you can't modify a data-* attribute with data(). Nice.. learn something new every day.
[15:09:25] <coldhead> Advocated: can't you just use CSS?
[15:09:29] <coldhead> and leave jQuery out of it?
[15:09:33] <coldhead> that's what CSS is meant to do
[15:10:21] <Advocated> yeah but i mean, all the buttons and so forth use jquery UI, but i cant find the alternative/the css that would be applied to divs, so yeah i'd like to just set the class or similar, but I can't find what they should be :S
[15:11:36] <coldhead> a lazy guy like me would inspect the shiny elements with web inspector or firebug, copy the styles i like and paste them in my stylesheet
[15:14:04] <Advocated> coldhead, yeah but ive got them working fine by default without me doing anything for buttons and so on.. so im wondering why divs won't/aren't styling.. if i had a div that was styled i would do as you say, but i've got nothing to compare against
[15:16:20] <fris> im trying to set somekind of counter for the div class, 1st entry needs to be box2, 2nd needs to be box, 3rd needs to be box and 4th needs to be box3 , http://jsfiddle.net/279v5/
[15:16:38] <coldhead> Advocated: they're leaving that up to you
[15:16:45] <coldhead> otherwise all UI sites would look the same
[15:16:50] <coldhead> instead of just having similar elements
[15:28:43] <bob_> hi folks
[15:28:44] <Advocated> coldhead, kinda done something, applied the ui-widget-content to it, looks better than it did, but a bit boring, I'm struggling to find any examples. Do you know of any at all?
[15:29:11] <coldhead> i don't, Advocated, i don't use UI
[15:29:19] <coldhead> i'd ask google for "cool jquery ui designs" or something
[15:29:23] <coldhead> get some inspiration
[15:29:35] <Advocated> oki, will have a look
[15:29:46] <bob_> I need help : i try to update the tutorial page of jQuery.com but impossible to create account on the website .... how can i had a tutorial ?
[15:29:51] <Advocated> I do have one further query, non asthetical related..
[15:30:21] <bob_> *add not 'had'
[15:30:39] <coldhead> ajpiano, danheberden: is account creation disabled at jQuery.com?
[15:30:55] <danheberden> coldhead jquery.com doesn't have account
[15:30:56] <Advocated> Say if ive got a bind event for mouseenter and mouseleave on a div, which shows another div, and hides it, this works perfectly, but.. ive added auto complete to the div it shows, again this works, but when i click some of the returned auto completes, obviously focus is away from the div, therefore it hits the mouseleave and hides the div. Any suggestions?
[15:30:59] <danheberden> *accounts
[15:31:12] <bob_> craps !
[15:31:15] <danheberden> you mean on docs?
[15:31:23] <coldhead> i don't mean shit, i hate jquery
[15:31:24] <KWhat_Work> anyone know of a tab extension / plugin that will get rid of that ugly tab bar?
[15:31:25] <bob_> please check this : http://jcheudin.blogspot.com/2012/01/normal-0-21-false-false-false.html?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed
[15:31:27] <coldhead> i'm asking for bob_
[15:31:41] <KWhat_Work> i just want the tabs without the background bar
[15:32:01] <danheberden> coldhead, i love you
[15:32:20] <coldhead> show me your boobs, danheberden
[15:32:21] <bob_> Impossible to find the link to add the previous link
[15:32:23] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[15:32:35] <danheberden> bob_ i have no idea what yo're talking about
[15:33:02] <danheberden> if you're looking to contribute learning materials, i'd look at the new learning site
[15:33:08] <danheberden> github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com
[15:33:16] <danheberden> that's where all that kinda stuff will go
[15:34:22] <bob_> on jquery.com there is a page tutorial or plugin, when I would like to add a link, they ask me an account. But impossible to find a link that goes on creation of accounts... so how can i share my awesome link to the community ?
[15:35:09] <coldhead> you can paste it here
[15:35:13] <danheberden> bob_ what domain?
[15:35:21] <danheberden> docs.jquery.com? api.jquery.com?
[15:35:57] <bob_> plugin.jquery.com ?

[15:36:41] <danheberden> i urge you to read that
[15:36:57] <Advocated> is it a bad idea doing? $('#client_box_container').bind('mouseenter mouseleave', function(event) {
[15:37:47] <bob_> Thanks guys !
[15:37:49] <danheberden> bob_ i put that warning REALLY big on that just for you, i had hoped you'd se eit
[15:37:50] <bob_> see ya
[15:38:28] <bob_> thanks you danheberden ^^
[15:42:39] <taipres> jquery rocks :) didn't realize it had a chan on here
[15:43:10] <systemfault> :)
[15:43:32] <shoelessone> It's a trick. This is actually a MooTools channel, masked as a jQuery channel :(
[15:43:45] <taipres> lol
[15:47:35] <BinaryMaster> http://jsfiddle.net/6y4bD/4/ , I'm sure the problem is simple I just can not see it my animation gets a gap in it can someone please look at it?
[15:49:58] <fris> is there a shorter way to do this? http://pastie.org/3240280
[15:51:49] <whoever> hi all is there a way to disable or prevent "open file" on IE's dowload promt
[15:52:17] <systemfault> fris: Assign the default first so you don't need the else
[15:58:03] <fris> systemfault here is the full code http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8980330/shorter-way-to-use-a-counter-for-a-div-class-in-jquery
[16:00:13] <systemfault> fris: Instead of count
[16:00:29] <systemfault> fris: Use the first parameter of the "each" function
[16:00:37] <systemfault> Which is the current index
[16:01:03] <systemfault> Ahhhh
[16:01:05] <red_square> he only increments inside the if systemfault
[16:01:11] <systemfault> oops :/
[16:01:31] <systemfault> Perhaps he could use modulo
[16:01:32] <fris> ya its for the div box class box2, box, box, box3, then repeat
[16:02:49] <Advocated> if ive got: $('#pt_box_container').bind('mouseenter mouseleave', function(event) { and a case for mousenter and mouseleavve, i disable/remove this by doing:  $("#search_pt_firstname").keypress(function() {$('#pt_box_container').unbind();});   how do i re-add/re bind that? do I have to recreate the whole thing, or can i sort of re enable it?
[16:04:19] <systemfault> Advocated: The same way you did it at the first place
[16:04:52] <Advocated> systemfault, basically im creating it in the first instance, so do I have to re-create the whole thing? i was wondering if I can somehow just turn it on/off?
[16:05:11] <red_square> Advocated I wouldnt bind/unbind, I would use .data and hold a property and do a check
[16:06:00] <Advocated> red_square, would that still work the same way I currently am then?
[16:06:06] <systemfault> fris: Something like that... I haven't tested it: http://jsfiddle.net/Z9Qyt/
[16:06:39] <systemfault> (replace all counts with index... oops)
[16:06:50] <red_square> Advocated no, since currently you are unbinding
[16:09:14] <fris> systemfault any help with which modulo i should use?
[16:09:32] <Advocated> red_square, i can't see in any examples how i'd use .data? unless im totally missing the point, im doing: http://pastebin.com/1jTPEXtA line 60 is my bind
[16:09:35] <systemfault> fris: Like in the link I pasted^
[16:09:36] <systemfault> >
[16:09:41] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/Z9Qyt/
[16:09:53] <fris> sorry didnt see it
[16:10:25] <amaroks> Hello guys, whats wrong with this small piece of jquery http://pastebin.com/SdkJu2NH
[16:10:26] <systemfault> fris: I think I mistakenly left a "count" when it should be index.. But you get the idea
[16:10:37] <amaroks> the first button works on click the second one doesn't work
[16:11:24] <amaroks> anyone please...
[16:11:27] <red_square> Advocated - too much code for me to grok + no idea what your page looks like
[16:11:51] <red_square> Advocated using .data you just store a value on the element
[16:12:04] <Hopsy> coldhead: do you use a SSD?
[16:12:29] <red_square> Advocated $('#id').data('eventsoff', true)
[16:12:36] <Hopsy> I dont know which one to buy
[16:12:44] <coldhead> not yet Hopsy !
[16:12:45] <red_square> then inside another func you can check this value
[16:13:01] <red_square> if ( $('#id').data('eventsoff') )
[16:13:17] <Advocated> red_square, so that element could be the div?
[16:13:20] <red_square> rather than bind/unbind all the time
[16:13:28] <red_square> which is expensive
[16:14:25] <Advocated> ahh ok, so would i bind on page load first to create what i'm after, on auto complete set the data to eventsoff true or whatever, then check for .data() after?
[16:14:36] <red_square> ya
[16:14:55] <Hopsy> coldhead: how did you send messages to me previous time from ninthfloor?
[16:15:01] <Hopsy> which command?
[16:16:15] <fris> systemfault works except box2 is only displayed on the first try cause of index==0
[16:16:38] <NaN> any good plugin to play with svg?
[16:19:44] <Advocated> whats the safest way to check for undefined? $('#whatever').val() would return "" wouldnt it? so is it worth doing if(.... == "") ?
[16:20:06] <Advocated> actually, i need to check if $('#var).data() == undefined
[16:22:10] <coldhead> Hopsy: write
[16:22:38] <coldhead> http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?write
[16:26:39] <KWhat_Work> is there a dev channel
[16:28:11] <Hopsy> how many times did I talked to you coldhead loool
[16:28:29] <Hopsy> this is keind of funny
[16:29:01] <KWhat_Work> ehhh working on jquery ui is really really painful
[16:29:18] <coldhead> it's 1970s technology, Hopsy
[16:29:20] <coldhead> i got one message
[16:29:21] <systemfault> KWhat_Work: Had the same experience.
[16:29:24] <coldhead> did you get a reply?
[16:29:41] <Hopsy> wel I got lots of 'y' chars
[16:29:41] <systemfault> KWhat_Work: It's not that bad if you're satisfied with the defaults.
[16:29:56] <Hopsy> but i saw something like FEOF?
[16:30:00] <KWhat_Work> im not sure what the point of extending stuff is when you practically have to rewrite the entire effing widget
[16:30:05] <Hopsy> and TEST witch capitals
[16:30:17] <Hopsy> then it crashed
[16:31:16] <coldhead> that was all i sent
[16:31:16] <KWhat_Work> lets look at ui.tabs, say you want to extend _processTabs, well guess what.  isLocal is some ie-shit-rigged anonymous function, there are even more anonymous variables like tabId and getNextTab
[16:31:22] <coldhead> i don't know about the Ys
[16:31:34] <KWhat_Work> i just want to beat someone with a large stick
[16:31:37] <Hopsy> it crashed
[16:32:14] <guy> does jquery support CSS3 rotate animation?
[16:32:28] <KWhat_Work> and this is the rewritten version.... I hate to see what the old one looked like
[16:35:32] <red_square> KWhat_Work you can always like, submit a patch
[16:36:13] <kborchers> open source ftw :P
[16:36:24] <KWhat_Work> red_square: Yah, I have been working on that but its sooo bad that i think this is almost hopeless
[16:36:42] <KWhat_Work> it goes from patch to effin rewrite in 30 minutes or less
[16:37:02] <KWhat_Work> and then i end up with supplemental libs
[16:37:26] <red_square> yeah, trying to be everything to everyone
[16:38:32] <Hopsy> going to bed
[16:38:35] <Hopsy> byee
[16:39:56] <ringotwo> guy, there are some plugins that support rotating
[16:40:20] <ringotwo> i've used jquery.rotate3DI, works pretty well
[16:40:31] <ringotwo> but the documentation is a little confusing
[16:41:50] <guy> yeah, found something that does the job
[16:45:00] <koulchilebaiz> hey all, can i do this: http://www.pageresource.com/jscript/jhover1.htm  with that script: http://jsfiddle.net/pKXuv/ ?
[17:14:09] <aca20031> jquery borked my code.
[17:14:15] <aca20031> I have an array of objects, called drops
[17:14:29] <aca20031> when i put this script, seperate from jqurey in the same file
[17:14:45] <aca20031> i get: if (!drops[i].start_point) console.log(drops[i]); -- function each(iterator,context){var index=0;try{this._each(function(value){iterator.call(context,value,index++);});}catch(e){if(e!=$break){throw e;}}return this;}
[17:15:16] <aca20031> am i crazy, or did it put a function in my array :(
[17:15:57] <aca20031> seems to have done that to all of my arrays
[17:16:14] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ aca20031
[17:16:14] <bot-t> aca20031, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:17:02] <aca20031> http://www.st0rm.net/forum/forum.php -- open a console and watch the error.
[17:20:44] <ringotwo> you're using prototype and jquery at the same time?
[17:21:10] <ringotwo> i don't think you can do that, at least not without separating them
[17:21:13] <aca20031> stupid forums use prototype, i cant take it away, but it hasnt caused a problem until now
[17:21:24] <aca20031> ive used jquery on the forum in the past to throw up another script
[17:21:28] <ringotwo> use jquery.noConflict() to separate jquery namespace from prototype
[17:21:50] <ringotwo> they both share the '$', which would most likely cause you some problems
[17:22:27] <ringotwo> when you're loading jquery, you're overwriting prototype's '$' namespace
[17:22:44] <aca20031> hmm when am i meant to use it? I use it at the top of my js page
[17:22:46] <aca20031> and i see no change
[17:23:20] <ringotwo> when are you meant to use what? not sure what you're talking about
[17:23:31] <aca20031> when am i meant to call jQuery.noConflict()
[17:23:32] <ringotwo> you should keep jquery and prototype separate
[17:23:34] <aca20031> i currently call it as the first line
[17:23:36] <aca20031> of my .js page
[17:23:52] <ringotwo> yeah, just at the top
[17:23:58] <aca20031> mhm..put it there..no change
[17:24:14] <ringotwo> let me look
[17:24:44] <ringotwo> drops still exists
[17:24:53] <ringotwo> it's just saying drops[i].start is undefined
[17:25:02] <aca20031> right, its undefined because at some point
[17:25:04] <ringotwo> where is start defined?
[17:25:14] <aca20031> drops[i] becomes function each(iterator,context){var index=0;try{this._each(function(value){iterator.call(context,value,index++);});}catch(e){if(e!=$break){throw e;}}return this;}
[17:25:20] <aca20031> start is defined in the prototype for raindrop
[17:25:29] <aca20031> and the only time i ever push to drops, is using that prototype
[17:25:34] <aca20031> somehow, that function ^ gets put in my array
[17:25:39] <aca20031> and i have 0 idea how
[17:26:18] <ringotwo> you might not have noConflict set up right, lemme look
[17:26:45] <ringotwo> what file contains noConflict?
[17:26:54] <aca20031> top of banner.js
[17:26:59] <aca20031> http://www.st0rm.net/custom/banner.js
[17:28:38] <ringotwo> did you read about noConflict() first?
[17:29:53] <aca20031> i thought so...it leaves $, which I dont think i use
[17:30:28] <ringotwo> so if you remove the reference to jquery.js and the plugin, then everything works ok?
[17:30:36] <ringotwo> what plugin are you using?
[17:30:41] <visua> This is kind of crazy. I have a 8000px wide image that needs to be scrolled.
[17:30:49] <visua> Using the .animate() function is really choppy.
[17:30:56] <aca20031> not using a plugin, custom javascript. The javascript works ok if i dont try to use jquery at all, for example...
[17:31:12] <visua> any suggestions
[17:31:30] <aca20031> http://www.st0rm.net/test.html
[17:31:37] <aca20031> the exact same banner.js there, without jquery
[17:31:45] <ringotwo> where is the custom code?
[17:32:16] <visua> I have this image down to 480k, and it's being preloaded. Just trying to get the margin-left animation to be smoother :\
[17:32:47] <aca20031> all the code is in banner.js, im having to add the canvas to the dom after load because the template we use is retarded and draws the header with php and not the template system
[17:33:18] <ringotwo> but why do you need jquery? where is the section of jquery code that you've added?
[17:34:15] <aca20031> well, something else used jquery on the site, a script that adds snow during the holidays, and it always worked fine
[17:34:28] <aca20031> so i was using the jquery to try to add my canvas to the dom
[17:34:30] <aca20031> i like jquery.
[17:34:33] <aca20031> javascript without it is lame
[17:35:04] <ringotwo> i'm not saying don't use it, i was just hoping you could point me to where you're using it
[17:35:15] <ringotwo> i don't see any jquery in your banner.ujs
[17:35:17] <ringotwo> js
[17:36:01] <aca20031> oh  http://www.st0rm.net/custom/banner.js its in add_to_dom()
[17:36:36] <visua> do you guys think it would be better to blit my background into a canvas element and animate it that way? http://lab.visua.us/tombras/recruiting/
[17:36:41] <visua> it's a *huge* background imgae
[17:37:26] <aca20031> and i know that code is simple to do with normal js, but that doesnt solve the problem (i tried) because the jquery on the site for the snow thingie still breaks it :P
[17:37:52] <ringotwo> yeah
[17:37:54] <ringotwo> i see it now
[17:38:43] <ringotwo> did you try moving noConflict into the html rather than calling from banner.js?
[17:39:38] <aca20031> thought about it, didnt do it
[17:39:39] <aca20031> lets see
[17:40:50] <ringotwo> also, you might try changing the order of how prototype and jquery is loaded
[17:41:18] <aca20031> i just made jquery the first line after <head>
[17:41:22] <aca20031> and noconflict the second
[17:41:23] <ringotwo> i imagine you'd want jquery first, then you can free up the namespace with noConflict
[17:41:28] <aca20031> still no go :(
[17:41:59] <ringotwo> on that link?
[17:42:00] <ringotwo> lemme look
[17:42:07] <aca20031> yeah on view-source:http://www.st0rm.net/forum/forum.php
[17:42:31] <ringotwo> visua, no, i think if you want the animation smoother, make the transition longer
[17:42:51] <ringotwo> firefox with firebug looks a lot choppier than browsers like chrome
[17:43:10] <visua> ringotwo: let me try that. Runs pretty well in chrome for me. Firefox is a slug :\
[17:43:22] <ringotwo> dispatchEvent is a prototype function, and it doesn't exist
[17:43:45] <ringotwo> really seems like a namespace issue
[17:44:18] <ringotwo> ohh
[17:44:24] <ringotwo> try loading prototype first
[17:45:19] <aca20031> hmm
[17:45:32] <ringotwo> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[17:45:39] <ringotwo> the example shows prototype loaded firstr
[17:45:49] <aca20031> bah
[17:45:56] <aca20031> prototype is loaded halfway down the page somewhere
[17:46:07] <aca20031> will take me an age to figure out which one of the 80 vb template files that is
[17:46:26] <ringotwo> File search?
[17:46:33] <Eviltwin> Then use function scopes
[17:46:36] <Zeph88> Hi - I'm trying to add an image to the page at the coordinates where a user clicks. Not having much luck in the google dept. Any tips?
[17:46:58] <Eviltwin> aca20031: Here are some examples of how to force $ to be jQuery for a particular function: http://jsfiddle.net/38TzZ/
[17:47:25] <aca20031> i put it in the footer
[17:47:30] <aca20031> im still not convinced its a namespace problem
[17:47:39] <aca20031> i see no reason a namespace issue should cause all of my arrays to be filled with a jquery function
[17:47:40] <aca20031> thats silly.
[17:48:36] <ringotwo> but the error is that the prototype function cant be found
[17:48:45] <Eviltwin> Zeph88: http://jsfiddle.net/6d746/
[17:48:45] <ringotwo> that's the initial error
[17:49:23] <Zeph88> Eviltwin: Oh, css... hah such old technology I forgot. Thanks! :)
[17:49:27] <Eviltwin> ...
[17:49:40] <Eviltwin> How the hell else do you plan to?
[17:49:42] <Eviltwin> Canvas?
[17:50:02] <Zeph88> Enhance your calm, was a jab at myself for forgetting. Thanks for the help =)
[17:50:51] <Zeph88> Actually I thought about canvas, but seemed overkill
[17:50:55] <Eviltwin> It is overkill
[17:52:37] <aca20031> hmm i may be mistaken about this being at all related to jquery..somehow i have the same problem without jquery on that page at all, maybe its prototype
[17:52:41] <aca20031> what the hell is adding things to my array!!
[17:52:48] <ringotwo> aca20031: that add_to_dom() is a busted function
[17:53:00] <aca20031> ..why
[17:53:11] <aca20031> it was adding the canvas just fine
[17:53:24] <aca20031> it doesnt matter, i removed it and used javascript only code, and still my array has some 'each' function in it
[17:54:52] <aca20031> http://zurahn.wordpress.com/2009/01/11/prototypejs-breaks-javascript-foreach-loops/
[17:54:57] <aca20031> god you have got to be kidding me
[17:55:19] <aca20031> what piece of junk is prototype
[17:56:03] <ringotwo> sorry, i thought the <canvas> wasn't closing
[17:56:11] <ringotwo> but i guess that doesn't matter
[17:56:51] <ringotwo> it's great that you want to get them both to work, but you're only using a couple of lines of jquery
[17:57:02] <ringotwo> why not just use prototype to achieve the same result
[17:57:11] <aca20031> because jquery was being used by other code
[17:57:19] <aca20031> that i would have to rewrite
[17:57:27] <aca20031> at any rate i got it to work, by not using foreach loops
[17:57:31] <ringotwo> ok, i thought you were just using it in add_to_dom()
[17:57:35] <aca20031> apparently prototype just outright breaks all foreach loops
[17:57:46] <aca20031> that has got to be the dumbest shit...
[17:57:47] <ringotwo> nice
[17:58:12] <ringotwo> it's just old and abandoned
[17:58:19] <ringotwo> it's like saying elvis sucks
[17:58:45] <oyvindmalin> Its probably me being tiered but if i have a method thats invoked with $(selector).lightBox(); how can i call it with .live() ?
[18:00:15] <ringotwo> $(element).live('click', function() { this.lightBox(); });
[18:00:29] <oyvindmalin> hmm thats what i have... must be something else thats wrong
[18:01:35] <ringotwo> what plugin is that?
[18:01:40] <ringotwo> jquery.lightbox?
[18:02:17] <oyvindmalin> http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/
[18:02:37] <oyvindmalin> i just googled "lightbox plugin jquery"
[18:02:43] <oyvindmalin> :P
[18:03:57] <ringotwo> so the problem is that you create new links, and the lightbox isn't working for them
[18:03:59] <ringotwo> ?
[18:05:10] <oyvindmalin> ringotwo: exactly
[18:06:35] <ringotwo> if you're generating links and appending to the dom in a loop, you can just call $(selector).lightBox() as soon as you've appended the item
[18:06:44] <oyvindmalin> ringotwo: i've tested with a link thast exists in the dom
[18:07:09] <ringotwo> can you send me a link to your page, or post somewhere
[18:07:18] <oyvindmalin> ringotwo: that did the trick :)
[18:07:20] <oyvindmalin> thanks :)
[18:07:23] <ringotwo> ah ok
[18:07:26] <ringotwo> np
[18:08:23] <oyvindmalin> now i just have to figure out how i can add a text to the lightbox with this plugin
[18:08:54] <ringotwo> that's a common thing
[18:09:08] <ringotwo> maybe you need a different plugin
[18:10:51] <ringotwo> it's a part of the plugin oyvindmalin
[18:10:59] <ringotwo> http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/
[18:11:11] <ringotwo> txtOf option
[18:12:33] <oyvindmalin> ringotwo: yup...
[18:14:15] <Zeph88> So I did the click add business from Eviltwins example: http://jsfiddle.net/6d746/, and it works great, but my click listener for images is not activating for images added using this snippet. Thoughts?
[18:17:56] <ringotwo> Zeph88, what does your snippet looklike
[18:18:46] <Zeph88> Sec, lemme put it up
[18:19:17] <oyvindmalin> ringotwo:  haha guess i need to find another plugin.. this one doesnt seem to work proplery.. any suggestions?
[18:19:46] <ringotwo> that's too bad
[18:20:00] <ringotwo> i've used topup before, it's kinda fancy
[18:20:37] <ringotwo> jquerytools is good, i've used that
[18:22:16] <oyvindmalin> ringotwo: do i need to add a div for each lightbox? or can that be done automagically
[18:22:24] <Zeph88> ringotwo: http://jsfiddle.net/v6HAV/1/
[18:22:36] <ringotwo> it really depends on the plugin
[18:22:47] <ringotwo> some plugins generate a lot of html and css automatically
[18:22:50] <oyvindmalin> ringotwo: with the jquerytools :)
[18:22:57] <ringotwo> others you have to write a lot of it yourself
[18:24:15] <ringotwo> does it matter that .map is a class and not an ID
[18:24:38] <ringotwo> #map IS the graphic
[18:24:39] <oyvindmalin> ringotwo: i really just need one where i can pass in a html string (or even just a string in general) and have it displayed below the image
[18:25:16] <ringotwo> you don't want to wrap $('<img>') inside $('#map'), right?
[18:25:35] <Zeph88> so map is the sandwich which I want you to be able to lay the dog over (click on the sandwich)
[18:25:54] <Zeph88> if you then click on the dog I want to do more, but the dog clicks are being ignored
[18:26:36] <ringotwo> so there are two images?
[18:26:47] <Zeph88> If you click on the sandwich :-)
[18:27:03] <ringotwo> the sandwich is #map
[18:27:05] <ringotwo> ?
[18:27:09] <Zeph88> yes
[18:27:38] <ringotwo> ok
[18:27:56] <ringotwo> oh
[18:28:18] <ringotwo> so you need to use jQuery.on()
[18:28:50] <ringotwo> the $('.icon') doesn't yet exist when you define the behavior for it
[18:29:11] <ringotwo> on() will let you attach the behavior to nodes that don't yet exist
[18:29:31] <ringotwo> or live() if you're using older jquery
[18:31:10] <ringotwo> or... you could also attach the click() behavior to the end of the chain when you're appending the markup
[18:31:14] <Zeph88> OH. Got it :-)
[18:31:25] <Zeph88> Yes, I had to move it up in the function from the map click
[18:31:27] <ringotwo> .appendTo('body').click(...)
[18:33:13] <Zeph88> Thanks!
[18:33:23] <ringotwo> yw
[18:41:39] <htoothrot> .on()?
[18:42:22] <htoothrot> oops
[18:42:36] <Giverny> .on('click', function(){ });
[18:42:39] <Giverny> :X
[18:43:03] <htoothrot> i thought delegate was the now recommended
[18:43:09] <htoothrot> what's the advantage of on?
[18:45:35] <brianfreud> This may be the most amusing code I've ever written...  http://pastebin.com/EG6ETuGK
[18:45:46] <Giverny> htoothrot http://api.jquery.com/on/
[18:46:02] <htoothrot> brianfreud, i don't know that i'd lay claim to that if i were you :P
[18:46:18] <brianfreud> lol, it's actually not as obfuscated as it looks
[18:46:54] <htoothrot> Giverny, ...thanks. i'm reading it, but the reason i should use it instead of delegate isn't jumping out
[18:47:01] <brianfreud> here's the deobfuscated version: http://pastebin.com/VwmTrV8a
[18:48:06] <htoothrot> why don't you just use a template?
[18:48:21] <brianfreud> GM script
[18:48:43] <htoothrot> oh
[18:49:21] <kborchers> htoothrot: .delegate just calls .on now
[18:49:27] <kborchers> so use on
[18:49:51] <htoothrot> kborchers, i see, might as well make the change anyhow..
[18:49:52] <htoothrot> thanks
[18:49:57] <kborchers> np
[18:57:33] <methods> can jquery output the css/xpath to an element ?
[19:00:12] <brianfreud> Anyone know any good l() i18n equivalents for jQuery?
[19:04:42] <Eviltwin> "l() i18n"?
[19:04:55] <kborchers> brianfreud: something like http://github.com/jquery/globalize ?
[19:05:50] <brianfreud> sortof, but that looks like it's everything except the text
[19:25:43] <oyvindmalin> aaand .. done :)
[19:30:28] <frenocha> is there a reason to use .ajax() over .load() if I don't need error callbacks?
[19:34:11] <Giverny> how i made this correct

[20:07:28] <ringotwo> methods, just keep finding the parent() of the element until you reach the top
[20:07:48] <Cyberdyne_T101> ringotwo: GET OUT.
[20:08:06] <ringotwo> push each to an array, then reverse the array, then join with whatever separator
[20:08:40] <Giverny> <Cyberdyne_T101>$('.cyberdyne').find('.sarah_conner');
[20:08:44] <ringotwo> I'll be back
[20:08:48] <Giverny> lol
[20:09:19] <Cyberdyne_T101> ringotwo: My mission parameters do not allow that.
[20:09:28] <ringotwo> .find('.sarah_conner:last');
[20:11:41] <ringotwo> whoever, i don't think you can control that dialog in IE
[20:11:45] <ringotwo> or any browser
[20:14:43] <Cyberdyne_T101> ringotwo: The T1000 is far more advanced than me; he has replaced the querySelector DOM method and will definitely find me there.
[20:15:48] <ringotwo> $('#t1000').clone();
[20:19:28] <Cyberdyne_T101> I'll be back.

[21:38:09] <tash> what's the easiest way to redirect to a URL in jq?
[21:38:28] <Eviltwin> The same way you do in JavaScript
[21:39:19] <Luzon19> window.location = "url";
[21:39:58] <tash> tried that & got an error ... probably something I'm doing wrong
[21:40:01] <tash> I'll play with it a bit
[21:40:17] <Luzon19> paste the code at jsfiddle
[21:40:25] <Luzon19> I'll take a look at taht

[23:19:08] <tab1293> i am trying to use .hover in order to show a hidden menu when an element is hovered over. how can i keep this hidden menu open when the pointer is hidden menu as well?
[23:20:21] <mindis|wurk> you could put the menu inside that same element
[23:20:41] <Cork> and use mouseenter/mouseleave instead of hover
[23:26:10] <infid> josiah that doesn't work either
[23:37:21] <infid> i figured it out, it's simply: alert($('li').eq(1).text());

[23:50:47] <hendry> Eviltwin: not yet, afterwards
[23:51:23] <hendry> Eviltwin: oh it works when it's attached to the DOM.. hmm
[23:51:41] <Eviltwin> Duh

[23:52:25] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ Tcalp
[23:52:26] <bot-t1> Tcalp, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[23:52:35] <alex88> hello guys, i've checked this http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/addClass but seems to not work http://jsfiddle.net/DE72k/ any idea?
[23:54:45] <Eviltwin> ablomen: Well for one thing you're not loading jQuery UI
[23:55:25] <Tcalp> Evil .. is something wrong with my syntax ?
[23:55:36] <Eviltwin> Yes
[23:56:07] <Eviltwin> alex88: For some reason it doesn't always work the first time
[23:56:18] <Eviltwin> I don't use jQuery UI enough to know the details
[23:56:19] <Tcalp> lol got it
[23:56:19] <Eviltwin> But this works: http://jsfiddle.net/DE72k/1/
[23:56:56] <alex88> Eviltwin: O.o oh, thank you very much.. i think i'll do that way, thank you ;)
[23:57:08] <Tcalp> Evil .. thanks for the non-direct tip ..  I'm coding this for a VQMOD (via XML code replacement) ~~ I just noticed my error
[23:57:11] <Tcalp> works now
[23:57:20] <red_square> alex88 dont include ui just for that
[23:57:42] <alex88> red_square: just use animate?
[23:57:42] <Eviltwin> Tcalp: If you were more familiar with JavaScript, I doubt you would have ever made that error
[23:57:48] <red_square> ya
[23:57:54] <Eviltwin> As it causes a JavaScript parse error
