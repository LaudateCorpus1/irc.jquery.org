[07:19:53] <segurb> http://w1r3.net/ccqbYD.txt why does this add class, despite actually adding it, does not show changes in DOM? ajax is triggered and whole DOM is frozen?
[16:25:26] <phelix> Anyone know why this is happening? When I mouseover this thte blue image appears and disapears rappidly over and over again.. Not sure why this may be happening.  https://jsfiddle.net/94kcyngb/
[16:26:15] <robertmaxrees> not happening here.
[16:26:29] <robertmaxrees> lemme try chrome
[16:26:34] <robertmaxrees> ah, there it is.
[16:26:38] <phelix> yes it was happening on chrome
[16:27:49] <robertmaxrees> so think abou tit.
[16:27:51] <robertmaxrees> *about it
[16:28:17] <robertmaxrees> you mouse over the image, right?  then you render another image and mouse over that.
[16:28:30] <phelix> ohh
[16:28:32] <robertmaxrees> which means you fire the "mouseleave" event, then your mouse goes back over the original image :)
[16:28:45] <robertmaxrees> bind the listener to .field-content instead and call it a day :)
[16:28:52] <phelix> ah yes. That makes sense.. hmm
[16:29:52] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:29:52] <phelix> any idea of a work around come to mind? trying to think lol
[16:30:02] <robertmaxrees> bind the listener to .field-content instead and call it a day
[16:30:10] <phelix> ahh got it.
[16:30:16] <phelix> thanks man!
[16:30:18] <robertmaxrees> so basically https://jsfiddle.net/Ldk8ogqa/
[16:31:26] <phelix> Awesome, thank you. Was having a hard time understanding what was going on. Will need to remember this.
[16:31:53] <robertmaxrees> def.  big part of why i avoid .hover() and bind directly to mouseenter and mouseleave.
[16:32:55] <phelix> ok. thank you again
