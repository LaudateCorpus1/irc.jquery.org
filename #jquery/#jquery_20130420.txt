[00:31:55] <JesperA> ?
[00:32:15] <nastus> hey guys im trying to dynamically take elements from a form and pass them via ajax, however Im not sure how to go about it http://jsbin.com/osizef/1/ is what I got but it didnt work, the form is being generated by PHP so I cannot use a set amount of variables
[00:32:18] <ali4ever4> hope if there is some jquery magic solution
[00:32:25] <JesperA> are you sure you have default zoom on default in both browsers ali4ever4
[00:32:38] <ali4ever4> JesperA, yes 100% sure
[00:32:43] <nastus> ali4ever4  all you have to do is use !important on your css style for your background
[00:32:52] <nastus> its a css problem not jquery
[00:33:45] <ali4ever4> nastus, thanks i know its off topic here but i though i could get some help
[00:34:17] <nastus> using !important on the select css field will override all parent elements
[00:35:04] <ezio> i'm calling remove on something and it's disappearing but it says it's still in the dom and when i $('#fname_error_label').length it gives me 1
[00:36:24] <nastus> hey guys im trying to dynamically take elements from a form and pass them via ajax, however Im not sure how to go about it http://jsbin.com/osizef/1/ is what I got but it didnt work, the form is being generated by PHP so I cannot use a set amount of variables
[00:36:26] <ezio> it's giving it display none
[00:36:45] <nastus> you're using remove() and not hide() ?
[00:36:51] <ezio> using remove
[00:37:04] <ezio> nastus, you need a form serializer
[00:37:25] <ezio> but post should do what you want
[00:37:52] <ezio> nastus, you want form.js
[00:38:50] <nastus> not quite sure how that works there
[00:39:14] <nastus> because I'm trying to do this dynamically, I can do it statically no problem
[00:39:24] <ezio> it'll do dynamic
[00:39:34] <ezio> it just makes it submit like post does
[00:39:53] <ezio> like action="post" but in an ajax cal;l
[00:40:03] <nastus> im already using an ajax call
[00:40:40] <nastus> im just trying to gather all the elements data into an array and pass it in an array lol
[00:41:58] <ezio> natus, even validate uses form.js
[00:42:18] <ezio> so it must have a way to get all the values in a form
[00:43:01] <JesperA> nastus just serialize your data, like: data: $('#admin-slider').serialize(), and it will catch everything in your form, instead of you manually select the stuff in data:
[00:43:27] <nastus> JesperA im just not sure how that passes the data to PHP lol
[00:43:41] <nastus> er well, how php will handle it
[00:43:47] <tdignan> learn the interface you're using
[00:43:55] <tdignan> don't think of php, think of HTTP
[00:44:20] <nastus> I know how itll pass it, I just dont know the code to receive it from serialize...
[00:44:22] <phiz> it's not a spoon
[00:44:28] <nastus> :/
[00:44:35] <nastus> ive never used serialize
[00:44:44] <JesperA> nastus the same way you would do it normaly in php
[00:44:59] <JesperA> it just sends the post data
[00:45:18] <JesperA> use method="post" in your <form>
[00:45:36] <phiz> serialize just grabs all of your form elements and encodes them as a string so you can post them easily to your PHP script
[00:45:42] <JesperA> or you already have post in jquery so yeah its done
[00:45:46] <phiz> once they're in PHP you treat them just like any other $_POST
[00:46:10] <nastus> ah, I was hoping to just post an array, but I guess ill just have to build one from the data
[00:46:39] <JesperA> ?
[00:46:50] <phiz> serialize will do that for you
[00:47:02] <JesperA> dude, as we said, use do it as you would normaly do in php
[00:47:05] <phiz> if you have something like a checkbox for example
[00:47:19] <phiz> PHP doesn't care how you build your POST
[00:50:27] <phiz> serialize will gather all of your form elements that have a name attribute and values from checkboxes and radio buttons if they are checked
[00:58:50] <ezio> okay my problem is that i'm inserting a label and it's showing going in hidden
[00:58:59] <ezio> only on the second iteration, though
[00:59:00] <ezio>                     $(this).closest('.control-group').append('<label for="fname" id="fname_error_label" class="error">Please enter your name</label>');
[01:08:47] <Lucky--> is django unchained any good? or is it just another nothing-but-blood/guts tarantino flick like grindhouse/killbill?
[01:10:28] <nastus> phiz it seems that it posts the data but its just not posting properly (as it clearly shows in my URL) hopefully I can fix this now hah
[01:11:41] <ezio> Lucky--, it's good
[01:18:52] <ezio> can someone help me out with a mysteriously disappearing element?
[01:19:03] <ezio> http://209.195.121.135/signup
[01:19:21] <ezio> let me know if you're getting that and i'll give you instructions
[01:24:34] <ezio> okay it says it's up from a proxy
[01:26:15] <antiPoP> Hi
[01:26:38] <antiPoP> I'm trying to check if a list of links contains some anchor text
[01:26:54] <antiPoP> if (!$("#loadDocument a:contains('"anchor_text"')")) {  ... }
[01:27:28] <antiPoP> if (!$("#loadDocument a:contains('anchor_text')")) {  ... }
[01:27:54] <antiPoP> however it does not work even if the value do es not exist. any help?
[01:28:09] <ezio> http://209.195.121.135/signup ... type in a fake email.  it'll ask you for first name and last name.  enter both then take away the last name, then start to take away letters from the first name, the error label will disappear, go to line 32 of signup.js and break there, take away another character and you'll see it disappear as you step beyond the outer function
[01:28:15] <ezio> fucking weird
[01:28:59] <Lucky--> antiPoP: no need to do that
[01:29:55] <Lucky--> $("#loadDocument a").innerText iirc should work
[01:30:21] <Lucky--> $("#loadDocument a").each(function(idx,el){if(el.innerText) })
[01:32:12] <antiPoP> the questions is that I have several values
[01:32:32] <antiPoP> and I need to append a new one if the current one is not in the current list
[01:32:37] <Lucky--> yes, and my 2nd
[01:32:45] <Lucky--> loops through the array of results that come back from the selector
[01:36:57] <antiPoP> here is some code
[01:37:00] <antiPoP> it works
[01:37:13] <antiPoP> and it's saves me to llop fromte array
[01:37:21] <antiPoP> but seems that contaisn finds and exact match
[01:37:26] <antiPoP> https://gist.github.com/antiPoP/c33028f6f27908a230c6
[01:37:33] <antiPoP> sorry a partialmatch
[01:37:38] <antiPoP> and Ineed to find an exact one
[01:39:41] <antiPoP> I also tried $("#loadDocument a").each(function(idx,el){console.log(el.innerText); })                 and all it returns in "undefined"
[01:41:33] <nastus> anyone know why serialize would be returning an empty field? :/
[01:44:11] <Lucky--> wrap it in a jquery
[01:44:16] <ezio> antiPoP, matt good fan?
[01:44:17] <Lucky--> $(el).innerText
[01:46:08] <antiPoP> Lucky--: still the same
[01:49:54] <Lucky--> jsfiddle it
[01:50:05] <Lucky--> drr i just realized something
[01:50:09] <Lucky--> $(el).text()
[01:53:32] <ezio> no body knows the troubles i've seen
[01:53:44] <ezio> http://209.195.121.135/signup ... type in a fake email.  it'll ask you for first name and last name.  enter both then take away the last name, then start to take away letters from the first name, the error label will disappear, go to line 32 of signup.js and break there, take away another character and you'll see it disappear as you step beyond the outer function
[01:54:14] <ezio> it's setting display none
[01:54:21] <ezio> no reason
[01:56:17] <ezio> this is worse than the boston bombing
[01:58:40] <antiPoP> Lucky I fixed it, here is how I did : https://gist.github.com/antiPoP/c33028f6f27908a230c6
[01:59:37] <antiPoP> I used your apprach finally I'm just worried about if el.text can give some issues in differnt browsers
[01:59:40] <antiPoP> and thanks
[02:00:19] <chovy> $(window).height() is the same as $(document).height() even though i have a scrollbar.

[03:41:05] <edlinde__> that is not using ajax?
[03:41:11] <edlinde__> its just a normal post I think

[04:31:45] <johannes__> in the css, the background-image: url(xxx.png) is defined first, and after that background-image: url(xxx.svg)
[04:31:55] <johannes__> So browser which do not support sag will take the png image
[04:32:33] <johannes__> But with $(whatever).css("background-image", "url(xxx)") I can only generate one background image

[05:40:10] <edlinde__> I want to parse the JSON string returned and display it's contents in the results DIV
[05:40:45] <edlinde__> how do I parse the JSON response, get the elements and then add my HTML to the DIV?
[05:42:24] <edlinde__> can someone help?
[05:46:37] <F1skr> edlinde__: JSON.parse(response) gives you a javascript object you can work with
[05:47:16] <edlinde__> F1skr: so in my code, is "response" a JSON string?
[05:47:49] <edlinde__> I haven't used jquery to loop though a javascript object and then add the contents to my DIV
[05:47:52] <F1skr> yes, if I unserstand you the server respond with json
[05:48:05] <F1skr> right?
[05:48:06] <edlinde__> ok thanks
[05:48:09] <edlinde__> yes it does
[05:48:32] <edlinde__> I need a tool to check the JS console
[05:48:41] <edlinde__> coz right now its just printing out to the console
[05:48:58] <edlinde__> I checked with Charles HTTP monitor to see what is being sent back and forth
[05:49:14] <F1skr> I use the chromium browser to debug
[05:49:38] <edlinde__> F1skr: is there an example of how I can use the JS object to then loop through its elements, extract and then display results in a nice way in the results DIV?
[05:49:55] <edlinde__> I am using Firefox
[05:50:30] <F1skr> isn't there a plugin called firebug or something for firefox?
[05:51:21] <edlinde__> yeah with web dev tools now I can see the JS console
[05:51:43] <edlinde__> but if you could show me an example of how I can loop through the JS elements then that would greatly help
[05:51:55] <edlinde__> haven't done any web dev in ages
[05:51:57] <edlinde__> :)
[05:53:18] <F1skr> edlinde__: I'm writing a small example ;)
[05:53:24] <edlinde__> thanks!
[05:53:38] <edlinde__> could you please use my snippet?
[05:54:11] <edlinde__> the thing is that I want to have each element showing up in the DIV like amazon shows its books
[05:54:32] <edlinde__> so I will need some space for an icon on the left, then lat/long coordinates
[05:54:48] <edlinde__> guess it should be some sort of blocks yeah?
[05:59:26] <F1skr> edlinde__: something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/VD9pp/
[06:01:12] <edlinde__> wow thanks
[06:01:19] <edlinde__> so each line in the block is a DIV as well?
[06:02:18] <F1skr> edlinde__: well you can make the html as you like, just an example of how to loop through the json response
[06:02:31] <edlinde__> sure makes sense
[06:02:36] <edlinde__> will integrate it and check it out
[06:02:48] <edlinde__> guess to make the results look better I will have to give it a nice css :)

[06:12:32] <bobsermon> pats_Toms: try var list = $('#list li');
[06:12:41] <no_gravity> pats_Toms: define what you mean with "select"
[06:13:36] <Imaginativeone> how do I obtain a document, using jQuery?
[06:13:52] <F1skr> pats_Toms: like this: http://jsfiddle.net/MFAEA/1/ ?
[06:14:10] <Imaginativeone> similar to the behavior I would get from an <input file> control
[06:14:34] <pats_Toms> aaah, there (http://api.jquery.com/last-selector/) is .filter(":last") mentioned
[06:14:39] <pats_Toms> thanks F1skr
[06:15:14] <pats_Toms> really don't know why it's not working...
[06:15:44] <pats_Toms> seems like need to use like bobsermon writed before
[06:16:15] <bobsermon> pats_Toms: for me it works also with the link from F1skr
[06:17:00] <pats_Toms> yes, it's working, thanks everyone...

[06:19:19] <Third3ye> Hey there -- any reason why the remove() won't work? http://hastebin.com/qicahaqisi.coffee I've checked the javascript console regarding errors and there are none...
[06:20:26] <Third3ye> I'm using jquery 1.9, jquery easing 1.3, ei-slideshow and for that specific function jquery waypoints 2.0.2...
[06:22:32] <F1skr> Third3ye: seems like you remove it before you append it..
[06:23:11] <F1skr> not sure how waypoint works though
[06:23:29] <Third3ye> F1skr: funny thing about that... the element is supposed to be stretched when scrolling down and put back in place again when scrolling up... and I can only achieve this effect by adding the scrollup first and the scrolldown second...
[06:23:33] <Third3ye> for some odd and contrived reason...
[06:24:40] <Third3ye> Here's waypoint however... can't spot any options that allow me to specify direction... I tried changing the "direction" within function to "up" or "down", but no cigar...
[06:24:43] <Third3ye> https://github.com/imakewebthings/jquery-waypoints/blob/master/waypoints.js
[06:26:24] <F1skr> Third3ye: I think you can just check the direction and do one or the other, no need for two waypoint calls as I understand it
[06:28:30] <Third3ye> F1skr: same here, just discovered the "docs" part xD
[06:28:36] <Third3ye> I can add an if statement inside
[06:28:52] <F1skr> yes if (direction === "whatever") {
[06:37:48] <co> Hello Guys I need help. I want a photo to be displayed just beside file upload's Browse button when I upload that photo. Can this be possible with jquery? Any help would be appreciated.
[06:38:55] <ctienrsg_>  co: pretty sure it can be displayed (that's first help :) )
[06:39:48] <co> ctienrsg_, thanks should I use json?
[06:40:38] <ctienrsg_> gave only 'first help', don't want to talk bullshit. u better ask some of the real experts here, not me
[06:40:56] <Third3ye> Fli-c: Well the script is updated but the img still won't be removed...
[06:41:24] <Third3ye> I ment F1skr :P
[06:41:29] <ctienrsg_> co u have a demo maybe?
[06:41:32] <ctienrsg_> that would be useful
[06:42:20] <co> ctienrsg_ yup. Wait let me jsfiddle it
[06:42:25] <F1skr> Third3ye: hmm could you maybe add some code to jsfiddle then I could take a look
[06:43:44] <Third3ye> Sure
[06:44:25] <ctienrsg_> co I have zero warranty that I can help you but some of the other 827 should be able to
[06:44:31] <ctienrsg_> *eat something
[06:45:27] <co> ctienrsg_ here it is. http://jsfiddle.net/e4T7n/
[06:45:48] <co> it has php code as well
[06:46:36] <F1skr> co you could submit the form with ajax and have the server respond with the url of the image..
[06:47:54] <co> Flskr, thanks. How can I do this. I mean with the help of which function?
[06:48:11] <F1skr> co ?.ajax
[06:48:31] <F1skr> ?$.ajax come on bot
[06:48:44] <F1skr> ?$.ajax
[06:49:07] <F1skr> hmm, don't know how this works lol, 2 sec..
[06:49:19] <F1skr> co: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[06:49:37] <co> Flskr,  thanks. Let me see it.
[06:51:01] <Third3ye> F1skr: getting it to work in jsfiddle was just a pain in the ass.. it wouldn't load the waypoints script at all. I could just show you directly.

[06:53:24] <Third3ye> Alrighty then :)
[06:54:21] <Third3ye> I'll give you the whole init script though, since there might be something in there besides the snippet in question thats causing the problem... I'm a complete newb if you haven't noticed :P

[06:56:38] <Third3ye> Btw, if there's a simpler way of doing this without using the relatively huge script that is jquery waypoints let me know
[06:57:02] <Third3ye> I don't think I'll be having the need to gather statistics about how far people scroll or horizontal scrolling just yet...
[07:03:07] <F1skr> Third3ye: hmm, is the if direction up efter reached? try debug with a console.log() message inside that if block
[07:03:42] <HenriqueMachado> Why my .autocomplete is never fired? http://jsfiddle.net/CFaYa/
[07:05:16] <Third3ye> F1skr: don't forget my n00b status :P Where should I add that? after remove?
[07:05:36] <F1skr> Third3ye: right before the remove line
[07:08:07] <diverdude> Why is this button not coloured blue ? http://jsfiddle.net/xK6dQ/2/
[07:08:20] <Third3ye> F1skr: I don't get any output in chromes developer tool...
[07:09:11] <Third3ye> F1skr: firebug says "nothing to output"... maybe I placed it wrong
[07:09:16] <F1skr> Third3ye: try console.log(direction); before the two if blocks to see the value of direction when you scroll up
[07:09:23] <co> Flskr, saw there. Btw which function is used to display an image from the url of the file that has been uploaded to the server?
[07:10:34] <F1skr> co: $('#your-img').attr('src', theurl); something like that I think could be used.
[07:10:39] <Third3ye> F1skr: just goes up and down, up and down...
[07:12:10] <co> Flskr, let me do it. thanks
[07:18:36] <Third3ye> Perhaps .remove("#TopLogo") is wrong? The capital letters that should be capital are capital and if I'm not mistaken using the id or class of an element in remove() will remove the element...
[07:18:52] <Third3ye> Is there another selector I can use to achieve the same effect, to see if that works?
[07:18:58] <diverdude> Why is this button not coloured blue ? http://jsfiddle.net/xK6dQ/2/
[07:21:21] <F1skr> Third3ye: try just use: $('#TopLogo').remove(); on it's own line below the one with width auto
[07:21:32] <shoky> diverdude: because input[type=button] is more specific than .foobarbtn, as a css selector
[07:21:59] <F1skr> Third3ye: this is was I got to work: http://jsfiddle.net/HfaDf/3/ I use a click event instead of the waypoint stuff..
[07:22:39] <diverdude> shoky, i thought class selectors were more specific than element selectors. class = 10 points and elements = 1 point'
[07:22:57] <shoky> diverdude:  that's true, but you also have an attribute selector, which is the same specificity as class selector
[07:23:29] <shoky> so input[type=button] is 1 + 10,  .foobarbtn is 10
[07:23:36] <diverdude> shoky, ok, so they are both 10 points...i applied the class last so it should still be more important
[07:23:46] <shoky> 11 and 10
[07:25:46] <Bloomberg> Hello guys!!
[07:25:48] <diverdude> i see
[07:25:51] <diverdude> thanks
[07:27:23] <Third3ye> Found a solution, F1skr -- a dirty workaround, but a solution none the less. I just added $('#TopLogo').remove();
[07:28:14] <F1skr> Third3ye: yes, that is what I meant, I think  know why it doesn't work now ;)
[07:28:23] <Bloomberg> Guys anybody know how can I change the content of a div dinamically with jquery?
[07:29:39] <Third3ye> F1skr: is it possible to find a workaround for .animate({width: 'auto')} to work?
[07:29:50] <F1skr> Third3ye: no actually I don't I can't make sense of it.. lol
[07:29:58] <Third3ye> ^^
[07:30:02] <ben-_-> Hi, I've pasted my code into pastebin, I hope you don't mind, also please excuse my newbie skills at JS..
[07:30:07] <ben-_-> I've put the code in here: http://pastebin.com/ctAGPEjN
[07:30:17] <ben-_-> I'm doing two things wrong (I think)..
[07:30:42] <ben-_-> in the .fail function, for some reason I'm not getting the errorThrown param, even though I'm using Servlet API of .sendError...
[07:31:20] <ben-_-> and the second thing I'm doing wrong, is trying to change the inner html of div errorMsg, trying to concat its' current inner html with the errorThrown
[07:31:53] <ben-_-> Thanks in advanced for any help solving these issues.
[07:32:06] <ben-_-> pif, sorry about that, was longer than I've expected.. anyone?
[07:34:06] <F1skr> ben-_-: for the concat of the innerHtml, you might need to have .html() instead of just .html
[07:35:20] <F1skr> and for the errorThrown, I would check what's in arguments object
[07:35:30] <ben-_-> ohh right, I see the mistake there..
[07:35:51] <ben-_-> how would I go about exploring this object (members?), considering I don't work in a JS IDE..
[07:37:00] <ben-_-> btw is + the correct operator for concating strings in JS?
[07:37:08] <F1skr> ben-_-: yes
[07:37:44] <F1skr> ben-_-: if you have a browser with js console, you could do console.log(arguments); and check that..
[07:38:33] <ben-_-> ok, I'll look into that, thank you for your time & help F1skr.

[08:06:48] <edlinde__> I want to set the value of input field "lat" to the value in "location"
[08:06:52] <edlinde__> its not working
[08:07:04] <edlinde__> is var F = $(this) correct?
[08:07:45] <edlinde__> anyone?
[08:07:57] <Koopz> aloha
[08:09:31] <edlinde__> any ideas how to fix this problem/
[08:09:31] <edlinde__> ?
[08:10:52] <Koopz> does anyone know js.hotkeys? I wonder how to use on() on keybinding instead of bind()...
[08:11:05] <Koopz> jquery.hotkeys*
[08:13:48] <edlinde__> seems like there is no one around :)
[08:14:02] <Koopz> i wonder if it's even neccessary to do that... I'm trying to bind a key to a function that triggers a click on an a-tag... that a-tag is not present when the initialisation happens... does that matter?
[08:22:03] <fxck> hey guys, any idea why this http://plnkr.co/edit/ZYYKIixcYzOL46hq0puS?p=preview  worked in 1.8.3 and doesn't anymore in 1.9.1(example here http://plnkr.co/edit/ETmQMY8KoCP0gaKdSrMD?p=preview)

[08:44:38] <warden23> Hello, I have a DIV on about.php called IMADIV.. is it possible to copy all the information in that DIV to another DIV on index.php using jQuery?
[08:44:53] <edlinde__> F1skr: still around?
[08:45:06] <edlinde__> wondering how I can remove all the contents of a DIV
[08:45:16] <F1skr> edlinde__: I'm here yes
[08:45:22] <edlinde__> I have been populating $('#result').append(html);
[08:45:27] <warden23> I mean is it even possible?
[08:45:28] <edlinde__> now the form keeps appending results
[08:45:44] <edlinde__> so I want to get rid of the previous results when the search is done again
[08:46:06] <edlinde__> can I say something like :   $('#result').empty() ?
[08:46:10] <Koopz> $('div').html('');
[08:46:13] <F1skr> edlinde__: I would use $('#result').html("");
[08:46:25] <edlinde__> cool
[08:46:27] <edlinde__> thanks will try
[08:46:40] <F1skr> edlinde__: but empty() should do the same
[08:47:00] <edlinde__> ok cool
[08:47:06] <warden23> Maybe the famous F1skr helps me also :D?
[08:47:11] <co> Flskr: I tried what you suggested. But its not displaying image
[08:47:17] <F1skr> edlinde__: that might be the more correct way to do it
[08:47:38] <edlinde__> so exactly as I had it?
[08:47:56] <Koopz> warden23: maybe $('#div2').html($('#div1').html()); will do the trick?
[08:48:11] <F1skr> edlinde__: have you tried that:  $('#result').empty() ?
[08:48:20] <edlinde__> trying now
[08:48:27] <warden23> Ok ill try that thx
[08:48:57] <F1skr> co: I would need to see some of your code on jsfiddle.
[08:49:55] <warden23> $('.cart-bill-to').load('http://localhost/testme/editaddresscartBT?Itemid=0 #main'); seems to be working thx for the que Koopz
[08:50:10] <warden23> Direciton*
[08:50:13] <warden23> Direction*
[08:52:08] <edlinde__> F1skr: empty works fine..thanks for the help
[08:52:13] <co> Flskr: it was not working so I deleted it. I should not have done that now I realize. The problem is its not selecting the image that has been given as an input to file upload. What is the code to accomplish that?
[08:52:47] <F1skr> co: you need to upload the image first using ajax
[08:53:24] <F1skr> and your server should respond with the url, then you can grap that url and add it to the <img> tag
[08:56:21] <fRAiLtY-> Is there a jquery-ui item that allows for say, a line of text "This is text" you click on it, and like a ui hover text box opens in with that text in, you type new text and like a "save" button, then it replaces the text. Like a "live" editor	13:50
[08:56:22] <fRAiLtY-> rap explanation
[08:56:26] <fRAiLtY-> crap*
[09:07:41] <HenriqueMachado> Finally! :D
[09:07:46] <HenriqueMachado> its working :D
[09:22:10] <mfranz> any idea why ajax async: false, to the same server would return data onsuccess but that data does not get injected into the DOM
[09:22:36] <mfranz> firebug shows the correct data return but that data is not updated on the page
[09:23:29] <mfranz> http://jsfiddle.net/4SPag/
[09:23:53] <mfranz> That is the ajax call, but the data (in the html) area does not get injected even though it is returned
[09:24:18] <mfranz> http://jsfiddle.net/4SPag/1/
[09:38:49] <Koopz> curse deviantArt's Ajax-calls... my userscript won't work because it doesn't load at the right time...
[09:41:06] <warden23> Hello I have a form within an iframe, can I use jquery to on click of save 'within iframe' it'll reload the entire page 'outside' of iframe?
[09:42:17] <warden23> Because currently I click save and it goes to another page within the iframe, but if I have a function or watever that when I click save it does its thing and then reloads the entire website not just the iframe.. if that makes sense?
[09:45:33] <warden23> Would it be along the lines of: opener.top.location.reload() ?
[09:50:05] <warden23> Argh I dunno.. I've narrowed it down that I want to do an onclick it'll reload the outside of iframe data.. hence the entire page..
[10:10:28] <mfranz> when I .clear a div then ajax append new data to that div it the new data doesn't display and according to firebug it is not injected into the DOM however the original data before the .clear is displayed correctly, any ideas?
[10:20:11] <DARKING> Hi!
[10:21:00] <gryg> Hello, I have strange problem with receiving json data from ajax() function. Can anyone look at code? http://pastebin.com/EZBP4uga
[10:33:44] <Koopz> is find() recursive?...
[10:34:39] <Koopz> nope...
[10:38:42] <Koopz> gosh darnit
[10:39:08] <Koopz> why can't i trigger an event on an element that gets loaded after initialisation?
[10:45:31] <nastus> anyone know why this wont post? http://jsbin.com/okoxod/1/
[10:52:43] <diverdude> Im doing this to react on image updates: $('.eventlist').on('load','.eventimage',function(e){...});  But its not working. What am I missing?
[10:53:02] <nastus> anyone know why this wont post? http://jsbin.com/okoxod/1/
[11:04:35] <raj> can I have two namespaces for an event so I have two ways of disabling it?
[11:05:03] <diverdude> hi, why is the fore-color of the button not turning blue when clicked? http://jsfiddle.net/YeTaW/3/
[11:07:24] <diverdude> can anyone help me?
[11:09:20] <Koopz> this channel is pretty dead...
[11:09:45] <Koopz> don't know if its just the fact that today is saturday that makes everyone just idle around
[11:10:17] <diverdude> Koopz, yeah. can you help me?
[11:12:54] <Koopz> the color should only change when the button is clicked?
[11:13:24] <raj> diverdude, looking
[11:13:29] <Koopz> http://jsfiddle.net/YeTaW/10/
[11:13:30] <diverdude> Koopz, yes. i want the color to change when the image src is changed
[11:13:42] <Koopz> like that?
[11:14:10] <diverdude> Koopz, nono. it has to be when image src changes. Thats the event im trying to catch
[11:14:52] <Koopz> that probably won't work if you use attr to change the src
[11:15:40] <diverdude> Koopz, why not? It works if i do it using $('').load(...); It just does not work when i use .on
[11:15:50] <diverdude> and i need to use .on
[11:19:07] <diverdude> raj, do you see the problem?
[11:19:12] <Koopz> well in order to trigger that on-function you need to trigger the load-event
[11:19:41] <raj> yes
[11:19:47] <Koopz> 'cause you bind the load-event onto that thing
[11:19:59] <raj> load doesn't run
[11:20:20] <diverdude> raj, exactly. why don't it run?
[11:20:28] <raj> i'm playing with it, not sure
[11:21:13] <raj> it only works if .myimg is in the selector
[11:21:23] <raj> and not made more specific in the event handler
[11:21:31] <raj> I'm surprised
[11:21:33] <raj> tbh
[11:21:35] <tw2113> why not use the change event with on
[11:21:51] <tw2113> .on('change',function(){ });
[11:22:09] <tw2113> only question being if you can attach that to the href attribute
[11:22:09] <diverdude> tw2113, that dont work either
[11:22:20] <diverdude> tw2113, thats not possible afaik
[11:22:55] <diverdude> raj, in which selector?
[11:23:16] <mfranz> Hi all, when I create a collapsible set the first time it works fine, however when I .empty the set then .append new data from ajax call the set becomes unstyled.  Any ideas?
[11:24:22] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/YeTaW/15/
[11:24:24] <raj> just inc ase
[11:24:27] <raj> *in case
[11:25:40] <tw2113> was worth a guess
[11:26:03] <diverdude> raj, not working :(
[11:26:29] <raj> load event is fired when the container is created?
[11:26:44] <raj> wait no
[11:26:49] <tw2113> bind your own event to the image?
[11:26:53] <raj> it always checks the parent
[11:27:00] <tw2113> ask why it MUST be on the image change
[11:28:14] <diverdude> tw2113, ofc. this fiddle is not a real case example...on my real page there is a reason why it must be on the image change
[11:28:22] <tw2113> which is
[11:28:42] <diverdude> tw2113, because the image is changed and i need to react on the image change
[11:28:55] <diverdude> and new images are added continously to the container
[11:28:59] <tw2113> and you can't do up your jQuery to do both changes at the same time
[11:29:09] <tw2113> instead of making it depend on the image being changed
[11:29:20] <tw2113> change both on the event that adds the image
[11:29:28] <diverdude> no because its a 2 fold process
[11:29:59] <diverdude> but i made a work-around...this seems to be a bug in jquery
[11:30:07] <tw2113> or just not a feature
[11:30:19] <diverdude> well it should be since .load() works
[11:30:29] <diverdude> then .on() should also work
[11:30:42] <diverdude> so must be a bug
[11:30:53] <tw2113> or no one made .on work the exact same way
[11:30:58] <tw2113> meaning it's not a feature
[11:31:02] <diverdude> so its a bug
[11:31:14] <Koopz> oh boy...
[11:31:21] <diverdude> since all other .evens works with .on
[11:31:30] <diverdude> why should .load be an exception
[11:31:40] <tw2113> file a ticket on the bug tracker and see how they respond
[11:33:05] <Koopz> so now that someone helpful seems to be here... I'm having an issue myself...
[11:33:23] <tw2113> http://bugs.jquery.com/
[11:33:33] <tw2113> i can't get it to load at the moment, but hopefully that's just me
[11:34:18] <Koopz> I'm trying to trigger an event on an element that doesn't exist when the code gets loaded...
[11:34:50] <Koopz> ...i guess this can be misunderstood...
[11:35:02] <Koopz> http://jsfiddle.net/Mvv7A/
[11:35:03] <diverdude> Koopz, why do you then want to trigger it?
[11:35:22] <Koopz> well i don't want to trigger it at the moment the code gets loaded
[11:36:19] <Koopz> i want to trigger it when i click on a button... but if the element doesn't exist while i load the code, the trigger doesn't work when the element is loaded
[11:37:05] <Koopz> if you click button 2 you can see that the first button gets triggered
[11:37:19] <Koopz> the code says button 3 should be triggered too
[11:38:03] <diverdude> Koopz, you just want to prevent first button to get triggered when button 2 is clicked?
[11:38:57] <Koopz> no i want the third button to be triggered
[11:39:02] <Koopz> but it doesn't get triggered
[11:39:23] <Koopz> hit the add-button and click button 2 after that
[11:39:38] <Koopz> logically, the button 3 should be triggered now that it exists
[11:39:41] <Koopz> shouldn't it?
[11:39:42] <Koopz> nope
[11:40:35] <diverdude> i dont think i understand your usecase
[11:46:51] <Koopz> I'm gonna get back to it... but first I'm afk...
[12:02:35] <raj> can I have events that use multiple nameclasses?
[12:02:54] <raj> or namespaces, whatever
[12:08:21] <mthompson> lo
[12:09:52] <nylon> is there a way to trigger a select box after you have dynamically changed it's options
[12:10:28] <raj> $('select').on('change', ...)
[12:11:16] <nylon> i'm using bootstrap select box and i'm setting options to 'disabled' but they don't show disabled until i click on an option in the selectbox
[12:11:32] <raj> how are you setting them to disabled?
[12:11:38] <raj> .disabled ?
[12:11:46] <raj> as a class?
[12:12:37] <nylon> in a loop i set $(this).attr("disabled",true)
[12:13:11] <raj> but it doesn't work until you make a change to the select?
[12:13:17] <nylon> yes
[12:13:37] <raj> what causes the loop to run?
[12:14:19] <nylon> $("#myselectbox > option").each
[12:15:52] <nylon> raj: after a ajax call i loop to update the select options to disable them
[12:15:55] <raj> you don't run the $('select').on('change' ...) within each iteration, right?
[12:16:04] <nylon> no
[12:16:19] <raj> ok, I'm not sure
[12:16:21] <raj> can you show more code?
[12:16:42] <nylon> let me setup a plunk and i'll be back
[12:24:20] <raj> yes, multiple namespaces are allowed on events
[12:24:30] <raj> don't know why I couldn't find that answer before
[12:38:34] <Koopz> back to my problem... the situation: I want to implement a userscript for the website "deviantart.com". if you click on one of the pictures, the site sends a post request and loads the picture-site dynamically. I want to trigger the click of a button on that dynamically loaded site. The shortcut seems to work but the trigger doesn't...
[12:38:44] <raj> how do I allow someone to pass in a string or a function to determine a string?
[12:39:25] <raj> I want my function to accept a string or a function
[12:40:36] <fikst> raj, in your function you can check if the passed variable is a function
[12:40:38] <Koopz> however if I call the trigger-function manually over the console, the trigger works
[12:40:39] <fikst> type
[12:40:44] <raj> Koopz, you can't simulate a file upload if that's what you're trying
[12:40:50] <fikst> typeof*
[12:40:50] <raj> i mean download
[12:40:57] <raj> wait, upload
[12:40:58] <raj> yes
[12:41:02] <Koopz> not a download, nor an upload
[12:41:25] <Koopz> a favorite-button
[12:42:35] <mfranz> Anyone around have experience with collapsible set when I empty().append(data) new data to the collapsible set during ajax call it loses styling
[12:42:36] <mfranz>  the first time it works great but after that the styling is gone
[12:42:38] <raj> i dunno, sounds like it should work
[12:43:03] <raj> mfranz, you added the style via js?
[12:43:27] <mfranz> The style is the default style for a collaspible set
[12:43:38] <raj> where did you define that style?
[12:43:40] <mfranz> like it is inherited since the data-role is collapsible
[12:43:44] <raj> in html?
[12:44:21] <mfranz> in the html the <div id="data_set" data-role="collapsible-set">
[12:44:39] <mfranz> then I populate a subdiv with <div data-role="collaspible">
[12:45:05] <mfranz> that works, but when I empty and then append new data the styling is gone, the new data is present in just raw html
[12:46:14] <mfranz> I think it has to do with how the collapisble set is refreshed, but there isn't good documentation
[12:47:56] <mfranz> would it be easier to see it?
[12:48:07] <sunbeam> hi, i have added some <input> fields using append(). these input are using jquery .datepick
[12:48:20] <sunbeam> so when thats added I do $('input.added).datepick();
[12:48:29] <sunbeam> however, the input field then dissapears
[12:48:31] <sunbeam> any idea how come?
[12:49:25] <nylon> raj: figured it out… there is a refresh method that calls refresh on the prototype
[12:49:28] <nylon> thanks
[12:52:08] <raj> nylon, what prototype?
[12:52:45] <raj> mfranz, yes, seeing it would be easier
[12:53:00] <nylon> raj: this.refresh = Selectpicker.prototype.refresh;
[12:53:39] <mfranz> raj: let me set that up
[12:53:43] <nylon> raj: so, calling $("#mySelect).selectpicker("refresh") does the trick
[12:53:54] <raj> nylon, ok, you didn't say there was a plugin involved
[12:54:11] <nylon> raj: my bad
[12:55:15] <mfranz> raj: fixed it...                 			$("#surgery_accord_set").empty().append(data);
[12:55:15] <mfranz>                 			
[12:55:15] <mfranz> $('[data-role="content"]').trigger('create');
[12:55:21] <mfranz> wow that looks bad
[12:55:37] <mfranz> I added $('[data-role="content"]').trigger('create'); after the .append(data)
[12:56:00] <mfranz> It seems that you have to refresh the content with create to push the styling
[12:56:38] <raj> you're using a plugin too, aren't you?
[12:56:59] <mfranz> raj: here is the stackoverflow in case you're interested http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15788538/create-dynamic-collapsible-set-after-ajax-call
[13:03:36] <diverdude> Why is my event not being triggered? http://jsfiddle.net/QnPhS/
[13:04:35] <fikst> diverdude, there is no #mybtn
[13:04:40] <fikst> only .mybtn
[13:05:55] <diverdude> fikst, ah ok this seems to work: http://jsfiddle.net/QnPhS/3/ is it the correct usage?
[13:07:01] <fikst> yes it is correct
[13:09:21] <Koopz> brilliant... managed to get that button clicked by using pure js...
[13:14:23] <diverdude> fikst, , why is the event not triggered now then? http://jsfiddle.net/QnPhS/4/
[13:15:56] <fikst> because the event is not triggered on .myimg
[13:16:14] <fikst> $(".container").on('myevnt','.myimg',function(e){
[13:16:38] <fikst> places a handler on .container, and handles event that bubble up from .myimg
[13:26:28] <alainus> I'm trying to return an array of the values of data-filter-key for each .option-set using: $('.filter-element .option-set').attr('data-filter-key'); . but It's returning only the first one. Do I have to use .each() and make the array manually ?
[13:50:07] <sunbeam> hi, i have added some <input> fields using append(). these input are using jquery .datepick
[13:50:10] <sunbeam> so when thats added I do $('input.added).datepick();
[13:50:11] <sunbeam> however, the input field then dissapears
[13:50:13] <sunbeam> any idea how come?
[13:52:36] <fikst> sunbeam, jsfiddle it
[13:59:47] <otters> with a horizontally resizable object, is there an intuitive way to restrict the left and right bounds it can be resized to instead of its max/min width?
[14:23:02] <alainus> is there a shorthand for .find('[data-filter-value]').attr('data-filter-value') ?
[14:28:46] <raj> var mystr = 'data-filter-value'; .find(mystr).attr(mystr)
[14:37:53] <sunbeam> fikst: how?
[14:38:28] <fikst> goto http://jsfiddle.net  and demonstrate your problem

[15:09:24] <jquery> Hi!!  Is there anyone in here that can help me for a min or two that knows jQuery
[15:09:36] <sadtaco> http://pastebin.com/nGRrGpwh  Why is callback() being called before those animations finish?
[15:14:40] <waxjar_> what is the best way to scroll to a specific element in a list that gets added to the DOM after the page loaded?
[15:15:58] <jquery> If anyone has a min or two to help, it would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks.
[15:16:01] <jquery> Please PM
[15:16:36] <anew> lol wut
[15:16:54] <anew> no one here knows jquery, and no one is definitely going to PM you lol
[15:17:07] <jquery> okay, well I didn't know

[15:22:48] <jquery> looking for help to make a dynamic table
[15:25:41] <sadtaco> nvm
[15:25:43] <Andrew_R> jquery: can you be more specific?
[15:26:19] <clh> folks .. any recommendations on a lightweight image carousel?  sure I could make one, but let's not recreate the wheel, right?
[15:26:47] <jquery> Andrew: I need a dynamic table and the highlighting of the table as a bottom text box is used to select an integer position. Integer row must start at 0 when showing position.
[15:27:56] <raj> if I'm turning a multi-namespaced clickhandler on and off, how can I make sure I don't turn it on twice? Essentially, test if it's on
[15:30:40] <Andrew_R> jquery: I use a plugin called jqGrid that might be a little overkill for your needs, but it should do what you want.
[15:31:07] <alainus> how do I get out of an .each loop if a certain condition is met ?
[15:31:16] <alainus> return; ?
[15:31:19] <jquery> Andrew, thanks.  I can't use plugins though, I have to actually have the code :/
[15:32:18] <Andrew_R> raj: when you are adding the .on, you could do a .off first to always unbind the previous (if any) event
[15:32:20] <raj> alainus, return false
[15:33:46] <Andrew_R> jquery: Would something like this give you what you need? $('table tr:eq(' + index + ')').addClass('highlighted')
[15:34:13] <jquery> Let me try, brb Andrew, thanks so much!
[15:34:14] <Andrew_R> for highlighting the row...
[15:42:37] <teear> queery
[15:42:57] <ideaprison> Hello, I'm trying to use a plugin and see from which point it starts (to skip some more odd explaining) I'm doing console.log($this)) to try and it returns [object Object] is there a way I can instead just get the object's name? like it's ID or CLASS name
[15:46:31] <philgourley> ideaprison, is this what you're after? $this.attr('class');
[15:47:17] <ideaprison> ah I know that one, i''l try things like that
[16:03:28] <raj> how can I turn a multi-namespaced eventhandler on and off without turning it on twice?
[16:08:07] <mloureiro> hello guys, isn't object.val('value  being set') exactly the same thing as object.attr('value','value being set') ?
[16:15:57] <sahbeewah> mloureiro, no... it's dependent on the object
[16:16:45] <mloureiro> so in my case it's a text input
[16:17:56] <mloureiro> when i do $('#theinputid').val('thevalue') i can see it changes the text on the input
[16:18:08] <mloureiro> but the value property of that object doesn't change
[16:18:11] <mloureiro> is it normal ?
[16:19:40] <sahbeewah> don't really see how that is possible, let alone normal
[16:20:07] <sahbeewah> paste some code
[16:20:09] <sahbeewah> ?fiddle
[16:20:12] <bot-t> sahbeewah, (jQuery .html().replace breaks in IE7-8 only. Example fiddle included.) - Opened 4 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10785
[16:20:32] <sahbeewah> well that was useless
[16:20:34] <sahbeewah> ?jsfiddle
[16:20:35] <bot-t> jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[16:20:52] <mloureiro> ok, sec
[16:31:27] <mloureiro> sahbeewah: it's hard to replicate the bug because i need to show it on the console, but here's what's happening
[16:31:28] <mloureiro> http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/3154/screenshot20130421at002.png
[16:32:14] <mloureiro> it sets the value of the first input to 'cenas' you can see it changed, but when you check the object it still has the old value
[16:53:39] <shoky> raj: use .data(...) to set flags or whatnot

[20:49:02] <gnarf> but...
[20:49:03] <gnarf> `ask
[20:49:03] <b-ot> gnarf: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[20:49:26] <jquery> I need help creating a dynamic table, can anyone help
[20:49:36] <gnarf> jquery: what does that mean?
[20:49:45] <gnarf> jquery: also, thats a really lame nickname :)
[20:50:17] <jquery> It needs to work off the text box when i type into it or backspace in the txt box, the table with 2 rows should populate and show the index (starting from 0) and the corresponding letter below it for all the letters typed into the text box.
[20:50:29] <jquery> i know its lame, sorry
[20:50:40] <gnarf> sounds like a homework problem?
[20:52:16] <jquery> ha, yes, it is.  I am stumped.  I have the highlight part working as far as highlighting the letter corresponding with the integer
[20:52:26] <jquery> but I cannot figure out how to add a dynamic box and have it correspond
[20:52:29] <gnarf> you'll want to put a keyup event on your input box using .on('keyup', function(){}), get its value using .val(), split the value up into an array of characters using .split('') and then build some table elements to inject
[20:52:54] <jquery> is there a way I can show you the code I have now
[20:53:05] <jquery> I know for css you can use pastebin, will that work with jquery
[20:54:32] <jquery> this is what I have
[20:54:35] <jquery> http://pastebin.com/nCTMC4WY
[21:03:53] <raj> shoky, brilliant
[21:05:58] <thinkerweb> I bought a website template with a jquery slider plugin, and the nav next and prev links work, but the individual dot image for each slide are linked up.  Do you think it would be difficult to do so?
[21:06:54] <Jan\> dismist ?
[21:15:21] <thinkerweb> Frig, the template is broken
[21:18:46] <raj> shoky, so should I keep an array of elements with clickhandlers on them? and then try and turn them on and off?
[21:18:53] <raj> I need a better way to handle clickhandlers
[21:19:02] <raj> or eventhandlers in general
[21:23:45] <chovy> howdy
[21:23:50] <chovy> i have a problem.
[21:24:26] <chovy> $div.css({ top: 20, left: 20}).show(); actually shows the $div before it is properly positioned.
[21:24:36] <chovy> it is inserted into the dom hidden.
[21:29:26] <chovy> ok, i think i found it
[21:29:36] <chovy> the css doesn't actually get applied until it is visible i guess.
[21:53:07] <raj> chovy, why's that?
[21:53:13] <raj> i don't think that's supposed to happen
[21:53:20] <raj> oh, with .show, perhaps
[21:57:24] <raj> I want to register eventhandlers somewhere so they can easily be turned on and off
[22:00:43] <chovy> raj: i insert it with <div style="display: none;">
[22:00:56] <chovy> and it looks like the css rules aren't applied until its visible. so there's a little flash.
[22:01:13] <chovy> this is news to me though.
[22:06:09] <Jan\> how can i hide div when page loads?
[22:12:56] <raj> chovy, seems fine to me http://jsfiddle.net/XYwpe/
[22:13:10] <raj> Jan\, $('div').hide()
[22:13:15] <raj> but css is better
[22:19:39] <raj> I want to register eventhandlers somewhere so they can easily be turned on and off. Specifically turn them back on without the need to provide a function
[22:23:18] <raj> I want to be able to turn all 'click.myNamedEvent' events on and off, without having to provide the function each time
[22:24:07] <raj> is there a game of thrones episode going on or something?
[22:24:21] <Jan\> raj can you help its not working? function hide_visibility("s-s") { $("."+"s-s").hide(); }
[22:24:34] <raj> Jan\, www.jsfiddle.net
[22:24:59] <Jan\> it saus  missing formal parameter
[22:25:02] <Jan\> says
[22:26:08] <raj> Jan\, can you paste your code in jsfiddle?
[22:26:54] <raj> you're defining a function with a string parameter?
[22:26:58] <raj> i don't think so
[22:27:21] <raj> you need to define it with a variable and pass a string parameter in when calling it
[22:27:30] <raj> or don't pass in a parameter at all if it's always 's-s'
[22:28:40] <Jan\> raj http://jsfiddle.net/qL3vY/1/
[22:29:10] <raj> Jan\, what browser are you using?
[22:29:16] <Jan\> firefox
[22:29:20] <raj> press F12
[22:29:34] <raj> read the error
[22:30:18] <Jan\> whats f12?
[22:30:26] <raj> a button on your keyboard
[22:30:26] <Jan\> console?
[22:30:34] <raj> yes
[22:30:55] <Jan\> i know its a button but whats the kb shrtcut for?
[22:31:02] <raj> f12
[22:31:13] <Jan\> doesnt work
[22:31:18] <raj> it's for console
[22:31:33] <Jan\> they changed them shortcuts
[22:31:48] <raj> oh, mine's still f12
[22:31:59] <raj> anyway, read the error when you figure out how to get to console
[22:32:15] <Jan\> its ctrl+shift+f12 now for web console
[22:32:50] <Jan\> its ctrl+shift+k now for web console
[22:33:19] <Jan\> but it doesnt help me right now
[22:34:32] <Jan\> raj function hide_visibility(sslegal) { $("."+"ss-legal").hide(); }
[22:35:08] <Jan\> how to make it apply on page load?
[22:35:28] <raj> you still haven't fixed your function
[22:35:54] <raj> use jsfiddle, that way we can look at the same code
[22:37:17] <Jan\> http://jsfiddle.net/qL3vY/2/
[22:38:27] <raj> Jan\, you've defined a function
[22:38:31] <raj> that function needs to be called
[22:39:32] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/qL3vY/3/
[22:40:17] <raj> equivalent to `hide_visibility()` anywhere else in the code
[22:40:38] <Jan\> can you explain what you did to make it work?
[22:40:49] <raj> I added `()` to the end
[22:42:25] <Jan\> and that makes it run how?
[22:42:34] <otters> it calls the function
[22:42:49] <otters> "somefunc" is an expression that returns the somefunc function, and "somefunc()" is an expression that executes that function
[22:42:59] <Jan\> but isnt the function name    ss     ?
