[00:13:59] <Xotix> how do i get the value of <a href="">Get This</a>?
[00:14:39] <coldhead> it has no value
[00:14:45] <coldhead> those are for <input>s
[00:14:54] <coldhead> you may want $(this).attr('href')
[00:14:56] <astropirate> Xotix: like a bows
[00:15:03] <coldhead> $(this).text();
[00:15:07] <Xotix> coldhead: i know. :) I just wanted to make it a bit clearer. I just want to get the text "Get this"
[00:15:08] <coldhead> i see the Get This now
[00:15:09] <coldhead> sorry
[00:15:13] <coldhead> long day
[00:15:23] <coldhead> long wretched day
[00:15:33] <astropirate> Xotix: give the anchor a class or id or somethign to identify it
[00:15:38] <Xotix> text() perfect! :)
[00:15:48] <Xotix> got it thanks a lot
[00:17:15] <DreamStiffler> Hi..im trying to get the last td text by clicking a checkbox. i tried $(e).last("td").text(); and doesnt work
[00:17:17] <DreamStiffler> any suggestion
[00:17:24] <_ramo> hi
[00:17:28] <_ramo> and good morning
[00:18:00] <_ramo> is there a jquery plugin that builds an overlay on  hover over each picture with two links on that hover?
[00:18:10] <DreamStiffler> it returns an empty string
[00:18:25] <DreamStiffler> fyi this checkbox is in the first td
[00:18:31] <coldhead> what is e, DreamStiffler?
[00:18:42] <coldhead> you might want to use ?nextall
[00:18:43] <bot-t> .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[00:18:50] <coldhead> ?siblings
[00:18:51] <bot-t> .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[00:18:54] <coldhead> or something like that
[00:19:10] <DreamStiffler> ok let me check. btw e is selected
[00:19:16] <DreamStiffler> selected row to be exact
[00:19:28] <coldhead> a tr?
[00:19:46] <coldhead> then you probably just need $(e).find('td:last').text()
[00:20:30] <theBrettman> what's best way to get the actual offset? it seems it's not including outer
[00:20:56] <coldhead> ?offset
[00:20:56] <bot-t> .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[00:21:22] <theBrettman> when I use offset() it gives me the offset + padding
[00:21:33] <theBrettman> idk y
[00:21:51] <theBrettman> actually, padding is inner
[00:22:03] <theBrettman> so I'm confused y it's giving me those coords
[00:22:54] <Xotix> http://jsfiddle.net/eZHcb/1/ click on google.  I've lefta comment describing my problem. How can i get the last clicked element on the btn's click?
[00:23:38] <theBrettman> nvm, not sure that's the problem... I can probably figure this out
[00:24:25] <fourcolors> Do you think there is a need for a good site to share sample code that is more static that something like jsfiddle or pastie? Like for references?
[00:24:50] <fourcolors> Like code samples and thats it.
[00:24:54] <Eviltwin> Well with pastebin once you paste, you can't modify the original
[00:25:09] <DreamStiffler> coldhead: somehow these doesnt work. its returning an empty string. Maybe ill explain again. I have a table row, which the first td consist of a checkbox. By checking this first checkbox, it will get the text in the last td. Itried using siblings as well but doesnt work. I think it has to do something with parent?
[00:26:13] <fourcolors> Eviltwin: ugg well I made a site for something like that, static samples but I'm trying to get feedback. It's only been up like 2 days but I'm wondering if anyone would use it
[00:26:29] <coldhead> Xotix: http://jsfiddle.net/eZHcb/2/
[00:27:08] <Xotix> ha yeah of course :P even have done that back a few monthsâ€¦ thansk a lot
[00:27:09] <coldhead> DreamStiffler: if `this` is the checkbox then i would use $(this).closest('tr').find('td:last').text()
[00:27:16] <Eviltwin> fourcolors: What advantage does it have over gists, pastebin, jsfiddle, or pastie?
[00:27:27] <fourcolors> Eviltwin: it's called samplaid.com if your interested. I need feedback though
[00:27:31] <coldhead> ?closest @ DreamStiffler
[00:27:31] <bot-t> DreamStiffler, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[00:28:00] <fourcolors> Eviltwin: simplicity. It has one purpose. Just sample code. gist is great but have you ever tried searching for gist? Never works out well for me
[00:28:38] <DreamStiffler> ohmygod i can kill myself
[00:28:48] <DreamStiffler> i tried closest but by using td earlier
[00:29:09] <fourcolors> Eviltwin: so less clutter too, not unworking code, just samples that work
[00:29:13] <DreamStiffler> thank you nonetheless
[00:30:05] <Eviltwin> Well if you can promise it all works, that's fantastic
[00:30:10] <coldhead> don't kill yourself, DreamStiffler, tomorrow will be better
[00:30:32] <fourcolors> lol... good point
[00:33:12] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/j9TKf/
[00:33:17] <Eviltwin> For last clicked
[00:36:01] <Xotix> Eviltwin: was that for me? thank but someone else already posted it :)
[00:39:26] <DreamStiffler> im beginning to love jquery
[00:40:32] <DreamStiffler> so basically is :nth-child(n)  the same with :eq(n) ??
[00:40:37] <mindis|wurk> hehheh. it does salvage the sea of crap that is webpage scripting
[00:41:29] <Eviltwin> DreamStiffler: Only in certain circumstances
[00:43:11] <Xotix> sry for asking again :P But how can i overload the event of a contenteditable div? A article about it would be nice ora little tut. My goal is to normalize the behavior for all browsers. so enter creates a br etc.
[00:43:31] <Eviltwin> DreamStiffler: http://jsfiddle.net/eecDx/
[00:43:47] <Eviltwin> Xotix: Google for it, I don't know of one off hand
[00:43:57] <meghdad> has anyone worked with the mapquery?
[00:44:12] <meghdad> though my question is a generic one
[00:44:37] <Eviltwin> meghdad: see #mapquery
[00:44:43] <meghdad> there is a jqueryui_object field in the lin that i use
[00:44:51] <meghdad> no, it is a generic q
[00:45:36] <meghdad> ... and its value must be set to a function which receives an arguments parameter containing the mothods that must be called
[00:45:38] <meghdad> method*
[00:45:56] <meghdad> the datetimepicker plugin has such a function
[00:46:00] <meghdad> and it is working
[00:46:16] <theBrettman> if var height = 195; and I set height -= 20; y is height still 195?
[00:46:16] <Eviltwin> You mean like .datepicker("setOption", "date", 0);
[00:46:18] <meghdad> but i cant find one for the mapquery and other plugins
[00:46:42] <Eviltwin> ?eval var height = 195; height -= 20; height
[00:46:44] <bot-t> Eviltwin: 175
[00:46:47] <meghdad> i am not sure if i have to write it myself or that i maybe missing something
[00:47:02] <Eviltwin> meghdad: Can't find what exactly?
[00:47:07] <meghdad> considering that i am barely familiar with jq
[00:47:11] <Eviltwin> I'm not entirely understanding your explanation
[00:47:14] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ meghdad
[00:47:14] <bot-t> meghdad, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[00:47:16] <Eviltwin> Start there
[00:47:32] <theBrettman> for some reason, I'm still getting 195...
[00:47:48] <meghdad> well, of course
[00:47:52] <Eviltwin> theBrettman: Then you have made some other error
[00:47:55] <meghdad> i would
[00:48:00] <meghdad> if i had the time
[00:48:09] <meghdad> i am in a hurry and need to deliver to the boss
[00:48:23] <theBrettman> watch it work in a fiddle and not on my page
[00:48:37] <Eviltwin> So you're going to grab blocks of code and cram them together in different ways till eventually it looks like it's doing what you wanted it to do
[00:48:38] <meghdad> Eviltwin, let me show u a pastebin code
[00:49:24] <Eviltwin> meghdad: If you do it quickly
[00:49:31] <IgnisDiabolus> ?learn
[00:49:32] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[00:49:40] <IgnisDiabolus> yeah!!!
[00:50:16] <Eviltwin> DreamStiffler: Did you understand the difference between nth-child and eq?
[00:51:39] <Eviltwin> theBrettman: You've seen see ?ftj before, right?
[00:51:40] <bot-t> theBrettman, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[00:53:42] <DreamStiffler> Eviltwin: so eq: starts with 0?
[00:54:38] <Eviltwin> DreamStiffler: Well check out this example now: http://jsfiddle.net/eecDx/
[00:54:50] <meghdad> Eviltwin, http://pastebin.com/BiP8BhhV
[00:55:59] <DreamStiffler> i did...so basically eq starts countring from the first ul till the last. which ew qould start counting from each start of ul. am i correct?
[00:56:06] <DreamStiffler> Eviltwin:  ?
[00:56:22] <ardeay__> evil twin 1u1b2
[00:57:03] <soee> hi, how can i grab image height?
[00:57:09] <Eviltwin> DreamStiffler: When you have {selector}:eq(n), it gets all the emends that match {selector} and then counts to the nth one and returns only that one
[00:57:38] <Eviltwin> When you have {selector}:nth-child(n), it returns only the element that match {selector} and are then nth child within their parent
[00:58:10] <Eviltwin> DreamStiffler: If you're still confused see ?:eq and see ?:nth-child
[00:58:11] <bot-t> DreamStiffler, :eq(index): Select the element at index n within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/
[00:58:11] <bot-t> DreamStiffler, :nth-child(index/even/odd/equation): Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[00:58:21] <DreamStiffler> ok thanks
[00:58:28] <DreamStiffler> ill do some tests as well
[00:58:49] <Eviltwin> meghdad: jQuery UI uses something called the Widget Factory to standardize all of their implementations
[00:58:56] <Eviltwin> ?g jquery widget factory @ meghdad
[00:58:57] <bot-t> meghdad, UI/Developer Guide - jQuery JavaScript Library - http://docs.jquery.com/UI_Developer_Guide
[00:59:12] <Eviltwin> If I had to guess, mapQuery does not
[00:59:39] <Eviltwin> So you're not going to be able to just magically bridge these the way you want to
[00:59:52] <Eviltwin> And I don't have the time to explain any further
[00:59:54] <Eviltwin> I have to go
[00:59:57] <Eviltwin> Best of luck
[01:00:00] <meghdad> thx
[01:00:37] <DreamStiffler> thanks
[01:04:43] <theBrettman> I'm getting even worse. somehow 167 - 0 = 147 and 147 -20 = 147. (ur results will vary on ur screen). http://jsfiddle.net/theBrettman/pQAEq/
[01:05:07] <Trudko> Hi, does it help if i have 6 fields which id are same - expcet number at the end(field_1 field_2 etc) if I write select  input[id^='field_'] vs id^='field_' ?
[01:05:22] <theBrettman> setting the height of the canvas dynamically
[01:10:09] <theBrettman> Trudko, u only use one id per element. use class instead
[01:10:36] <IgnisDiabolus> select what?
[01:11:44] <theBrettman> oh, I see what he meant. u could do that but why not just put a class on it to get a collection of those elements by class
[01:16:54] <Trudko> theBrettman: i would say personal preference in project...
[01:16:54] <xec_> Trudko: what do you mean by "does it help"? as in performance?
[01:16:58] <Trudko> yes
[01:18:00] <xec_> i would expect it would help to add "input" so jquery doesnt need to look at all id's in the dom - but i'm not sure, try jsperf.com
[01:27:19] <K3|Chris|Work> xec_: you helped me with http://jsfiddle.net/n4gyQ/ yesterday right? nice job, sorry was really busy at the time when you replied with a mini-crisis... anyway nice, but is there a way to make them display in order? currently any ones not wrapped in a div get shown first, out of order
[01:27:52] <K3|Chris|Work> *paragraph
[01:27:55] <K3|Chris|Work> or is it possible to make the "leftovers" also wrapped in a paragraph
[01:28:52] <xec_> keep getting 502 Bad Gateway

[01:34:16] <xec_> got jsfiddle working again, K3|Chris|Work, how about something like this http://jsfiddle.net/Uh2ek/
[01:37:44] <antdillon> I dont want to spam the channel but just launched a project using jQuery and recieved help here so Thank you all that helped: http://www.ubuntu.com/tour
[01:40:41] <Xotix> jsfiddle should upgradeâ€¦Anyway. if you go to this demo http://jsfiddle.net/eZHcb/3/ and add "Test" after Google and press the show content button, you will see that "Test" is outside of the <a> but if you go to the span, it gets added into the span. Why?
[01:41:37] <theBrettman> how come offset() gets the area inside the padding? is there something that just gets the very outside?
[01:43:03] <K3|Chris|Work> xec_: sweet, works :D
[01:47:38] <Xotix> If i have an contenteditable div, can i detect what char is before the blinking pipe? And e.g. getting to know if the pipe is currently in a span etc?
[01:48:13] <DreamStiffler> ok im learning how to do array be it javascript or jquery
[01:54:34] <Trisox> what is the best site for seeing browser market share?
[01:59:08] <Hooloovoork> Trisox: there is no best site. get the average from every site you can find =P
[02:00:06] <Hooloovoork> all of those sites measure browser use on different websites, and depending on which websites they measure they get different results. like jquery.com won't have many IE6 users etc.
[02:01:13] <Xotix> does ie still not support selectionStart?
[02:03:26] <Trisox> statcounter.com
[02:18:02] <DreamStiffler> if anyone already fammiliar with me then good. if not let me intro im a coding newbie be it js jquery or any other coding language. i need to do an array (if thats what its called) and return the value of each selected checkbox td text. please review here http://jsfiddle.net/32WQk/2/ and suggest
[02:19:12] <DreamStiffler> problem is, the alert shows only the last checked value. not both checked values
[02:19:34] <DreamStiffler> how do i do this
[02:22:37] <nFFF> DreamStiffler your code confuses me, you don't even create an arrary to contain your checked td's? You can re-write this whole code in a few lines of jQuery
[02:23:21] <DreamStiffler> nFFF: i would be very happy if i could create it for you as well. but this is as far as my knowledge goes for now.
[02:24:02] <DreamStiffler> nFFF: im struggling to understand coding it self...and also jquery and js at the same time
[02:24:26] <nFFF> an arrary is jsut a collection of elements/values
[02:24:54] <DreamStiffler> nFFF: yes..i think i kinda got that. doesnt my for loop does that?
[02:24:57] <nFFF> var newArrary = []; newArray[0] = 'hi';
[02:27:00] <DreamStiffler> nFFF: reading aray in w3school now. not sure about the jquery in few lines u just said
[02:29:49] <nFFF> DreamStiffler, look into the following:  $('input:checked').each(function(){

[02:44:39] <SamK1975> i'm trying to bind() an event handler to a child (other way round from normal) so when the parent triggers the child receives the event. The problem is the trigger function creates a event bubble path upwards in the DOM so the child's handler is never called. Anyone know if this is possible?
[02:45:51] <muzone> lar_zzz: still though theres nothing wrong with http://alpha.jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/qmG4J/11/ right?

[02:55:48] <Xotix> How can i disable draggable of a child?
[02:59:28] <DreamStiffler> maybe im doing this wrong by using array. what should i do if i have multiple checkboxes each representing a td text valuein different rows, and wanting these values which are checked to be returned ?
[03:04:45] <fof> you can use a selector as was suggested earlier, i'd recommend going through this if you haven't: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[03:06:46] <Xotix> http://tinyw.in/4KGb the right *editor" is a table. each of this elements are own little tables (newsletters, tables are okay) how can i disable the element by double clicking on it on the right? so if the editor is active ,you should not be able to move it around.
[03:11:54] <fof> when the edit-in-place box is shown could you do table.draggable('disable')? then 'enable' when it is hidden?
[03:13:06] <mehrdad> i need to use this line of code return $.fn[this.jqueryui_object].apply(this.$input_picker, arguments);
[03:13:17] <mehrdad> and am i want to use mapquery
[03:13:48] <mehrdad> but in mapquery, i am not sure of there is an fucntion that its signatures matches the one that the above lines calls
[03:14:02] <mehrdad> that is the jueryui_object
[03:14:18] <mehrdad> jqueryui_object *
[03:14:23] <Xotix> I'm just going with disabling all by doing $('.sortable').sortable("option","disabled","true"); can't figure out how i can disable childs seperately. But actually it doesn't matter. Thanks you suggesten is quite the same :)
[03:16:48] <nFFF> DreamStiffler, as said earlier
[03:17:04] <nFFF> you can do it in jquery using input:checked and each()
[03:18:09] <nFFF> but I think your main issue in your code is that when you submit your form, your values theFirstTd and the other one
[03:18:19] <nFFF> are using whatever the last input checked was
[03:18:33] <nFFF> you define them within the previous function
[03:19:19] <nFFF> as you iterate over the DOM for checked input's you need to use 'this' or $(this) for the current input
[03:19:29] <nFFF> but your using the previous function's last values
[03:19:35] <nFFF> hence why you are only recieving one output
[03:19:40] <nFFF> -> the last checked box
[03:25:55] <nFFF> DreamStiffler http://jsfiddle.net/32WQk/3/
[03:26:36] <Xotix> If i have e.g. jQuery.fn.foo = function() { and i want to use e, do i need to pass it? e.g. $(bla).foo(e); and jQuery.fn.foo = function(e)?

[03:52:54] <nights> hi
[03:53:02] <nights> im trying to use jquery tabs
[03:53:16] <nights> im loading them by ajax (the tabs themselves are also ajax enabled)
[03:53:27] <nights> when doing this, the JS stop working and the tabs dont fire
[03:53:36] <nights> what can i do to rememdy this?
[03:53:42] <nights> livequery?
[03:54:35] <DreamStiffler> nfff: oh thank you nFFFF, you just made me understand "this" better.
[03:54:58] <DreamStiffler> no wonder its returning the old value
[03:55:15] <DreamStiffler> maybe some extra practises will make me remember this
[03:55:18] <DreamStiffler> "this"
[03:57:05] <DreamStiffler> nFFF: btw i assume this jquery input:check .each method is a lot better than a js?
[03:58:12] <theBrettman> can u make a multidimensional array like this: var addSidebar = [['Name: ', 'name'], ['ID: ', 'id'], ['Description: ', 'description'], ['Before Widget: ', 'before_widget'], ['After Widget: ', 'after_widget'], ['Before Title: ', 'before_title'], ['After Title: ', 'after_title']];
[03:58:42] <theBrettman> cuz it's not working
[03:58:47] <DreamStiffler> because im researching on js..and wonder how do i get the value of the td into the checked value and apply it to the array. telling about going nuts
[03:58:54] <DreamStiffler> again jquery rocks
[04:01:06] <DreamStiffler> actually i DID try this method you gave...but using (e) instead of (this)..anyways good to know
[04:03:35] <AdvoWork> this is normally a server side question i'd ask, but say my url is: index.php?test=123 is there a way I can get test=123 or just 123 with jquery?
[04:04:13] <nights> how can i deal with loading the jquery ui tabs by ajax? when doing this, the tabs dont fire anymore. if i dont load them by ajax they work fine. (this is not a question about loading tab content by ajax).
[04:04:42] <alians2012> Ciaoooooooo :>
[04:04:44] <mindis|wurk> AdvoWork http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1403888/get-url-parameter-with-jquery
[04:06:01] <theBrettman> can u make a multidimensional array like this: var addSidebar = [['Name: ', 'name'], ['ID: ', 'id'], ['Description: ', 'description'], ['Before Widget: ', 'before_widget'], ['After Widget: ', 'after_widget'], ['Before Title: ', 'before_title'], ['After Title: ', 'after_title']];
[04:10:42] <nights> how can i deal with loading the jquery ui tabs by ajax? when doing this, the tabs dont fire anymore. if i dont load them by ajax they work fine. (this is not a question about loading tab content by ajax).
[04:12:09] <AdvoWork> if i've got $("#add_product").click( )  how can i mimick clicking that, ie call that same click?
[04:16:41] <Xotix> when selecting a nested class, what do i have to care about? somehow i just don't get it.
[04:21:37] <nFFF> Xotix, what don't you get?
[04:22:25] <nFFF> Guys, I have some elements inside a .ligthbox , and I have a click binded to .lightbox, however when the click is within any element inside lightbox, I don';t want it to fire, jsut want it's directly on the .lightbox element
[04:22:26] <nFFF> Any ideas
[04:24:37] <mehrdad> how do i subscribe to events?
[04:25:02] <Cork> you mean binding event?
[04:25:05] <mehrdad> as in two layers of events
[04:25:29] <Cork> .on('click mousemove', function(event) {});
[04:25:32] <mehrdad> mapquery event handler that handles openlayers event
[04:28:40] <mehrdad> Cork: in mapquery i need to know when a point is created on a openlayers map
[04:28:57] <mehrdad> in the openlayers source, there is a callback function 'done'
[04:29:10] <mehrdad> which handles the point creation event
[04:29:32] <Cork> ok, so your interested in connecting something like mousedown and mouseup?
[04:29:37] <mehrdad> but in mapquery i have no idea how to subscribe to it
[04:30:13] <mehrdad> well the code sample u provided is easy if it is written per se
[04:30:24] <mehrdad> but mapquery seems a little complicated
[04:30:59] <Cork> never used it, so donno
[04:31:38] <Elena-rus> how on earth do I paste code in comments on stackoverflow
[04:33:42] <Cork> Elena-rus: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/72082/changes-to-syntax-highlighting
[04:34:11] <Cork> additionally http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/981/syntax-highlighting-language-hints
[04:36:27] <Xotix> I needa quick overview about how the selector works, any good links? Somehow i don't get my class.
[04:37:27] <Cork> Xotix: its pure css selectors
[04:37:38] <Cork> it works exactly how css selectors work
[04:38:41] <Xotix> if I'm in $('body').on("click", '#hrefEditFormBtn', function() { here select } does it just select within body or does it always take the whole document?
[04:38:56] <Elena-rus> thanks Cork, I've tried ` ` to post the code, but it wouldn't enter line spaces, and the hope code is displayed inline?
[04:39:04] <Elena-rus> *the whole code
[04:39:43] <Cork> Elena-rus: you've tried <pre></pre> ?
[04:40:17] <Elena-rus> nop
[04:40:39] * Cork have never posted a comment on stackoverflow
[04:40:41] <Elena-rus> it's too late I can unfortunately only edit the comment for 5 minutes
[04:41:17] <Elena-rus> thanks for the effort, anyway
[04:41:23] <Cork> np
[04:42:13] <Xotix> ah got it, stupid mistake :)
[04:45:55] <Jacob__> Hi Guys
[04:46:38] <Jacob__> i have some wierd errors with jquery fancybox
[04:46:51] <lmatteis> hello fellas
[04:47:01] <lmatteis> what's a good skeleton for writing jquery plugins?
[04:47:26] <lmatteis> i wanna be able to use methods from within my plugin, so I want to be able to do stuff like $("foo").pluginName();
[04:47:34] <lmatteis> but also, maybe, $.pluginName.someMethod
[04:47:44] <lmatteis> or something along those lines
[04:47:56] <lmatteis> any help?
[04:48:11] <risky_s> hi , I am having trouble getting the jquery validation to work, not sure whats wrong, but the error message won't appear - http://jsfiddle.net/rTKzW/
[04:48:20] <Cork> so you want to add your plugin to $.pluginName and $.fn.pluginName
[04:48:24] <nights> how can i deal with loading the jquery ui tabs by ajax? when doing this, the tabs dont fire anymore. if i dont load them by ajax they work fine. (this is not a question about loading tab content by ajax).
[04:49:20] <lmatteis> Cork: fn.pluginName will make it work behind $(). right?
[04:49:29] <Cork> yes
[04:53:34] <ZadYree> Hello
[04:53:41] <risky_s> any help ^?
[04:58:31] <TheJohlin> Hello everybody! Does anyone know if the yayQuery podcast will continue?
[05:04:01] <JKarsrud> ask ajpiano or rmurphey?
[05:04:38] <Xotix> how do i get the  current element which has focus?
[05:05:15] <kborchers> ?:focus @ Xotix
[05:05:15] <bot-t> Xotix, :focus: [New in v1.6] Selects element if it is currently focused. http://api.jquery.com/focus-selector/
[05:06:17] <Xotix> yeah i'm already playing around with :focus
[05:10:35] <jarr0dsz> hello everyone im trying to get this to work: http://jsfiddle.net/eZt6C/6/
[05:10:42] <jarr0dsz> it works in jsfiddle but not in my webapplication ;s
[05:10:58] <jarr0dsz> i have exact same js and markup there to no avail any idea how I could debug this? firebug also shows up nothing
[05:11:53] <diverdude> Hey, if i have minimize, maximize and close buttons what is the best way to check which button is clicked if they have the same handler? img src is obvious, but maybe a bad idea because the code wont work if icon and thereby is changed...any other ideas?
[05:14:08] <Xotix> hmm got it solved a different way but thanks :)
[05:14:10] <atula> diverdude: I like using class name... there's also the $(e.target) bit... plenty of ways
[05:14:19] <atula> diverdude: how do you want to do it?
[05:14:49] <diverdude> atula, e.target...what do i then compare with?
[05:15:13] <atula> stick with class name
[05:15:27] <atula> $(this).hasClass('minimize') is quite clear, diverdude
[05:15:32] <diverdude> yeah i think class is better
[05:15:52] <atula> target is when you have all three images and they are in the same container and you're doing event delegation
[05:16:01] <atula> which I don't think you're doing
[05:16:39] <diverdude> atula, no...not delegating event
[05:16:44] <diverdude> im not doing that
[05:17:17] <atula> class="button minimize"   $('.button').click(function (e) { var _self = $(this), is_minimize = _self.hasClass('minimize');  if (is_minimize) { //stuff}
[05:17:22] <indraveni> i am using jquery .load function to load the contents generated by php file dynamically,
[05:17:25] <indraveni> my code is at http://pastebin.com/Vi6bHhAD
[05:17:32] <atula> diverdude: much clearer in the future when you're maintaining
[05:17:48] <diverdude> atula, yes i agree. i will do that. thank you friend
[05:17:58] <atula> diverdude: not a problem. good luck.
[05:17:58] <indraveni> on arriving a condition $r!=0 ( nothing but status of a background process) I have to redirect the user to report.php
[05:18:09] <diverdude> atula, why store $(this) in variable?
[05:18:17] <indraveni> this code which I have pasted, is showing the redirected page in the div tag
[05:18:31] <indraveni> which is not appropriate
[05:18:43] <indraveni> i want the user to get redirected on arriving a condition
[05:18:49] <indraveni> how do I achive this?
[05:19:04] <atula> diverdude: making a $(this) query multiple time instead of just storing it to a variable to resuse later... AND for scoping purposes... $(this) is different in another inside function
[05:19:06] <mehrdad> anyone here worked with mapquery?
[05:19:07] <bot-t> (686 hours ago) <kborchers> tell Mehrdad fix your client then explain your question better
[05:19:34] <indraveni> is there a way to do this?
[05:19:54] <mehrdad> fix my client?
[05:20:09] <kborchers> Lol @ 686 hours ago
[05:20:20] <mehrdad> wth
[05:20:22] <kborchers> U kept connecting and disconnecting
[05:20:58] <mehrdad> lulwat
[05:21:25] <diverdude> atula, i have this setup <h1><img class="minimize"/><img class="maximize"/></h1> and i have in my ready func: $("h1 img").click(...); and $("h1").click(...); so that means if i press the image the handler is called twice...How can i void that? Because i still want it to be possible to press the header?
[05:22:00] <atula> diverdude: heh. that's what I thought you wanted event delegation
[05:22:21] <mehrdad> kborchers: u know mapquery?
[05:22:23] <diverdude> atula, hehe ok :D How does that work?
[05:22:30] <kborchers> Nope
[05:22:45] <manisabri> Hi .... Im returning a template with a script tag and insert it to a page with .html(data) in my ajax done callback.why there are several instances of the script added to the page each time I get the page? I do remove the div that contains the page but the scripts  window > CompilationUnit not in my body!! any idea?
[05:23:50] <indraveni> am i not going in right direction??
[05:24:09] <atula> diverdude: the idea is you bind 1 event on the h1, then check for target... same idea  instead this time _self = $(e.target);
[05:24:29] <diverdude> atula, ahhh yeah ok i get it...nice idea
[05:24:40] <Xotix> How can i delete the formatting when pasting something into contenteditable div?
[05:24:49] <atula> diverdude: you might want to look into event bubbling too. it's a good thing to know.
[05:28:18] <manisabri> what is this compilationUnit in the DOM? how can I remove my scripts from it?
[05:28:31] <diverdude> atula, hmm but e.target gives me e.g. <img class="closeChat" src="/usr/share/themes/Ambiance/metacity-1/close.png"> so I have to do string manipulation to see which image it was?
[05:30:17] <diverdude> atula, ahhh i can just do $(e.target).attr('class')
[05:30:40] <muzone> ravenzz: heheh
[05:30:43] <muzone> well done =)
[05:30:46] <manisabri> firebug says my script path is this: http://localhost:5000/js/libs/jquery/jquery-1.7.1.min.js/eval/seq/1
[05:31:03] <muzone> ravenzz: for a sec there i thought u were gonna play a joke like this other guy: http://alpha.jsfiddle.net/qmG4J/13/
[05:31:10] <manisabri> in DOM inspector shows it in window>compilationUnit!
[05:34:05] <atula> diverdude: same deal. use class name
[05:34:31] <atula> it's probably easier to maintain and you might change the src...
[05:35:23] <linusoleander> Is it possible to change the HTTP_REFERRER value using javascript?
[05:36:28] <Cork> no
[05:36:51] <Cork> well rather, not on normal links
[05:36:52] <indraveni> my code is loaing the content dynamically, but unable to break the loop
[05:36:56] <indraveni> need help please
[05:36:57] <Cork> but i think you can on ajax calls
[05:37:22] <Cork> ?demo @ InDigital
[05:37:23] <bot-t> InDigital, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:41:38] <InDigital> Cork ?
[05:42:48] <Cork> InDigital: if you need help you need to provide the code you have problem with
[05:43:01] <Cork> and the code need to "work" so ppl can see the problem
[05:43:20] <Cork> (that means not just a pastebin.com dump)
[05:43:39] <alaing> can someone help me with some content that I'm trying t ostyle with jquery ui?
[05:43:43] <alaing> http://pastehtml.com/view/bngjg271h.html
[05:43:59] <alaing> the main div wrapper is shrinking
[05:44:16] <alaing> jquery ui = theme roller
[05:44:45] <InDigital> Cork i havent asked for a help :)
[05:45:28] <Cork> InDigital: ugg sorry wrong nick --'
[05:45:46] <Cork> man theres just too many users with almost the same nicks :/
[05:46:03] <Cork> alaing: try adding ui-helper-clearfix to the ui-state-error div
[05:46:11] <indraveni> i have provided the code
[05:46:19] <indraveni> but no one is responding here
[05:46:30] <Cork> havne't seen it
[05:46:35] <alaing> Thanks Cork I'll give that a try
[05:46:41] <InDigital> help needs more people than there is halpers :)
[05:46:50] <InDigital> *helpers
[05:47:21] <Cork> indraveni: when you ask again, post the link again, as ppl might not have been here when you asked the last time
[05:47:53] <indraveni> my code is here, http://pastebin.com/Vi6bHhAD
[05:48:06] <indraveni> i am using jquery .load function to load the contents generated by php file dynamically,
[05:48:19] <indraveni> on arriving a condition $r!=0 ( nothing but status of a background process) I have to redirect the user to report.php
[05:48:26] <indraveni> this code which I have pasted, is showing the redirected page in the div tag
[05:48:33] <indraveni> which is not appropriate
[05:48:51] <indraveni> i want the user to get redirected to another page, on arriving a condition
[05:49:15] <alaing> Thanks Cork that works perfectly.
[05:50:41] <Cork> indraveni: so you want window.location = 'new url' then
[05:51:08] <Cork> alaing: nice
[05:51:12] <indraveni> yes Cork , but that window.location should execute when $r!=0 as given in show.php
[05:51:56] <Cork> indraveni: well you would have to instruct the js to do it
[05:52:08] <Cork> you could for example send a 404 or something
[05:52:13] <indraveni> but how do I pass the php variable to js?
[05:52:20] <Cork> catch that as an error client side and use window.location
[05:52:33] <Cork> indraveni: you either send js or json
[05:52:38] <Xotix> InDigital: json, echo it as js
[05:52:45] <Cork> else you would have to parse the dom
[05:52:59] <Cork> Xotix: wrong nick :)
[05:53:02] <InDigital> :D
[05:53:04] <indraveni> Cork: providing as 404 error? how do I do that?
[05:53:04] <InDigital> again
[05:53:11] <Xotix> ups sry
[05:53:28] <indraveni> i tried this, in else part of show.php
[05:53:31] <Cork> indraveni: by setting a response status
[05:53:31] <indraveni> 	echo json_encode(array('isDone' => TRUE, 'redirectTo' => 'report.php'));
[05:53:35] <Cork> in php
[05:53:37] <InDigital> Cork is it possible to create IRC client with JQuery?
[05:53:43] <indraveni> but I am not understanding how I can process this from my main php file
[05:53:55] <Cork> InDigital: not in jquery, but through websockets
[05:54:00] <InDigital> ok
[05:54:17] <Cork> i've seen ppl hack something through form elements
[05:54:31] <Cork> though that only works cause the irc server accepts junk in the connection
[05:54:47] <InDigital> ok i see
[05:54:52] <Xotix> howcan i clean up my pasted stuff? somehow i got a solution but i can like reproduce it on jsfiddle, wanted to ask something but now i'm lost again.
[05:55:24] <Cork> Xotix: not sure what your asking
[05:58:32] <Xotix> e.g. changing the paste event so that i take the pasted text, copy it into a textarea so it is going to be normal plain text (no formatting) and return it so it gets pasted. But somehow i don't get the returning part. http://jsfiddle.net/aYCd7/1/
[05:58:38] <JohnnyRun> someone has to suggest me a xmpp client for a simple web chat?
[05:59:51] <Cork> Xotix: as long as your going through a plain text editor, it works fine for me
[06:00:57] <Xotix> yeah, but i need it directly
[06:02:01] <Cork> Xotix: it depends on the receiving client
[06:02:26] <Cork> when its copied from/to the website it gets/has extra markup
[06:02:39] <Cork> and thats what causes it to break
[06:02:56] <Xotix> that's what i want to get rid of.
[06:03:23] <Cork> except adding an extension to the browser, i don't think you can
[06:03:53] <Cork> you might be able to do something with the onpaste event
[06:03:58] <Cork> but not sure
[06:05:44] <Xotix> Of course i can.  All the forums and community need to do it. I just want to clean the receiving data :)
[06:08:02] <Xotix> Doesn't a textarea clean it up?
[06:08:45] <jeffsmykil> How would I do this the correct way?  if (dateInput.val().search(/^(0[1-9]|1[012])[- /.](0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])[- /.](19|20)\d\d$/))
[06:08:53] <fof> InDigital: IRCCloud uses jquery for its UI
[06:09:21] <InDigital> i will look on it
[06:09:54] <fof> websockets for the IRC connections
[06:09:57] <xec_> jeffsmykil: the correct way to create a regex is smashing the keyboard while blindfolded
[06:10:18] <jeffsmykil> i have monkeys for that xec_ and they came up with that
[06:10:24] <nFFF> :DD
[06:10:31] <jeffsmykil> i mean is the rest of it right
[06:11:00] <fof> have a few invites if you want one
[06:11:14] <jeffsmykil> it took a lot of poop throwing to come up with that xec_
[06:11:23] <nFFF> jeffsmykil
[06:11:32] <nFFF> .val() returns
[06:11:48] <nFFF> a string or not?
[06:11:57] <nFFF> maybe need to convert it to string
[06:12:18] <jeffsmykil> returns an array
[06:12:22] <nFFF> otherwise it should work
[06:13:10] <indraveni> i have tried something with json just now
[06:13:21] <indraveni> please tell me, whethere
[06:13:29] <indraveni>  $.ajax({ 					  url: ("show.php?showfile=<?php echo $showfile; ?>&uid=<?php echo $UID; ?>&pidst=<?php echo $pidst; ?>"),
[06:13:32] <jeffsmykil> nFFF: ((dateInput.val()).toString.search(/^(0[1-9]|1[012])[- /.](0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])[- /.](19|20)\d\d$/))
[06:13:43] <indraveni> will carry the get parameter values to show.php or not?
[06:13:55] <nFFF> Can you convert an array to string like that jeffsmykil?
[06:14:12] <nFFF> yes you can so
[06:14:13] <nFFF> should work
[06:14:17] <jeffsmykil> k ty
[06:14:51] <xec_> indraveni: you can use the data property of the options object to pass parameters
[06:15:26] <minver> How do I add an EventListener to my object? http://jsfiddle.net/GbC3f/
[06:15:31] <xec_> indraveni: $.ajax({ url: "show.php", data: "showfile=whatever"})
[06:20:53] <indraveni> xec_:  to pass more than one parameter, data: "showfile=<?php echo $showfile; ?>","pidst"=<?php echo $pidst ?>,
[06:20:58] <indraveni> is this right?
[06:21:35] <xec_> indraveni: slap an ampersand between them
[06:21:53] <xec_> indraveni: $.ajax({ url: "show.php", data: "showfile=whatever&pidst=woot"})
[06:23:11] <nFFF> minver, I'm not sure if jQuery can bind handlers to non DOM events
[06:23:16] <nFFF> like object creation
[06:23:17] <indraveni> and to read these values in show.php, i should use json_decode or php GET ?
[06:23:20] <nFFF> but Id be interested to know
[06:23:42] <blackspotwiggins> xec_, you should pass an object literal to data
[06:23:54] <rciovati> hi guys i need to change programmatically the form method. with 		$('#myform').attr("method", method); it works in chrome but not in firefox. any idea?
[06:25:15] <xec_> indraveni, blackspotwiggins; so - like this? $.ajax({ url: "show.php", data: { showfile: "whatever", pidst: "woot" } }) ?
[06:25:21] <blackspotwiggins> yea
[06:25:39] <xec_> thanks
[06:27:40] <indraveni> with thse changes my new code is http://pastebin.com/mrhKYQ74
[06:28:16] <indraveni> 1. its not showing the content from showfile, 2. its redirecting the page , but again loading it into the div block rather than loading in complete windows
[06:29:57] <indraveni> couls someone please check what is the problem in my code
[06:30:35] <xec_> indraveni: not to be a bore, but it looks to me that you are passing get variables directly to a shell command?
[06:31:01] <indraveni> yes ,
[06:31:09] <xec_> maybe it is a good thing you can't get it to work
[06:31:13] <blackspotwiggins> lol wat
[06:31:26] <indraveni> later I would add the validation to the get parameter

[06:32:37] <Staley> hi, im wondering how one could make the application to autoscroll to something in the page when cliked on
[06:33:03] <nFFF> Staley, you can do it with html :P
[06:33:18] <xec_> (tm)
[06:33:31] <blackspotwiggins> is that a jquery plugin?
[06:34:07] <Staley> ok how
[06:34:39] <nFFF> lookl up <a href and <a name
[06:34:48] <indraveni> xec_:  what is wrong in my code other than validating the get parameter
[06:34:50] <theBrettman> anyone else having problems with jsfiddle timing out?
[06:34:55] <indraveni> why is it not working as expected
[06:34:56] <xec_> <a href="#footer">Scroll down to the element with ID "footer"</a>
[06:35:11] <mekwall> Staley, it's called anchors
[06:35:36] <Staley> yeah i remembered now its been a while
[06:35:47] <xec_> indraveni: i can't help you with the php, havent used it in years. can you see the http request happening in your browser? with firebug or whatever
[06:35:54] <Staley> but i also saw some plugin scrollto
[06:36:03] <mekwall> indraveni, how do you expect getting help solving a problem when using a version of jQuery that is over 3 years old?
[06:36:18] <mekwall> indraveni, that's most likely your biggest problem to begin with
[06:36:38] <theBrettman> is there a problem with jsfiddle? can anyone tell me?
[06:36:44] <blackspotwiggins> indraveni, you should pass parameters in data: {} not in url AND data
[06:36:49] <theBrettman> cuz I have had problems with it all day
[06:37:01] <xec_> theBrettman: its been slow for days
[06:37:10] <theBrettman> ok
[06:37:24] <theBrettman> thought it my be my connection and I'm hardwired in
[06:38:33] <indraveni> blackspotwiggins: i passed in data:
[06:40:41] <xec_> indraveni: indeed, so why you have it in the url: as well? :)
[06:41:08] <indraveni> xec_:  if I am passing values with data: then how do I read them in show.php?
[06:41:18] <indraveni> should I go for json_decode?
[06:41:21] <indraveni> and not get ?>
[06:42:05] <xec_> indraveni: like i said, i can't help you with the php bit - but are you sure the http request is actually made?
[06:42:24] <indraveni> ok, i will check it
[06:42:24] <xec_> indraveni: any reason you have parens around your url?
[06:42:28] <indraveni> today its time up for me
[06:42:36] <indraveni> need to leave, will try tomorrow,
[06:42:40] <indraveni> thanks for all your help
[06:42:48] <xec_> -.-
[06:42:56] <indraveni> thanks...many thanks
[06:52:23] <Staley> question: in jquery versions < 1.5 what is the cache set to?
[06:53:03] <Xotix> Cork i could just get the text() of the pasted stuff right? This should be clean. But how do i return it?
[06:54:02] <diverdude> Staley, to whatever is put in it?

[06:58:20] <brettster> this is prob a noob question
[06:58:29] <brettster> how can i apply a scroll up to the prev selector
[06:58:43] <brettster> currently when clicking scrollup
[06:58:49] <brettster> it applies the scroll down effect
[06:59:02] <brettster> and copy and pasting doesnt seem like the best method of doing this
[06:59:12] <brettster> isn't there a way to chain the effect to the selector?
[06:59:36] <xec_> ?demo @ brettster

[07:06:41] <poppiez> hi guys, I'm creating this modal dialog that goes on top of the content. I want to disable scrolling in the page while the dialog is active so I add a dialog class to `html` that has overflow: hidden; this disabled scrolling but when I hit space it scrolls down a notch. any way to prevent that?
[07:06:48] <brettster> scrollVert
[07:06:51] <brettster> thanks a lot.
[07:06:53] <brettster> appreciate it
[07:07:35] <Fox`> i want to select an image, and i can using the find function, but how do i return the html of the image and not just the image object?
[07:07:54] <Xotix> How can i manipulate the paste?
[07:09:12] <fof> fox can you use .html() on the element? http://api.jquery.com/html/
[07:10:13] <Fox`> no. i think html() retrieve the content of an element
[07:10:38] <villain_> Fox do you need the url or img tag?
[07:11:41] <Fox`> the whole image would be better, but i guess i could get the url pretty easily
[07:11:42] <xec_> Fox`: you can dump it in a dummy element and do .html() on that - but there might be a better way to do what you really want to do
[07:12:06] <xec_> Fox`: what do you want the html for?
[07:14:52] <fof> if you dont want the html, what attribute is it you want?
[07:16:00] <nFFF> fof, .html() returns the html within the element
[07:16:05] <nFFF> not the element itself
[07:16:16] <ruby_on_tails> how can i scroll to the bottom of the page at one shot ?
[07:16:38] <fof> yes, i thought he wanted the img html, so he could have used that with a dummy element
[07:16:51] <ruby_on_tails> nvm will use the height of the page
[07:17:10] <nFFF> Yes that's the only way, and I'm sure it's what he wants
[07:17:22] <Kambfhase> .get(0) ?
[07:19:46] <Fox`> xec_: cloning
[07:19:50] <nFFF> Kambfhase thanks didn't realise you could do that
[07:19:58] <Kambfhase> :)
[07:20:08] <Fox`> i do want the html, but html() gets the inner html. there is nothing in an img tag
[07:20:25] <nFFF> Fox` try what Kambfhase said
[07:20:32] <Fox`> ok
[07:20:41] <Kambfhase> .get(0) gives you the DOM-node.
[07:21:05] <Kambfhase> you can then try .outerHTML on that.
[07:21:17] <xec_> Fox`: you can just .clone() it?
[07:21:39] <Taloncor> var html = $('<div>').append($('#image').clone()).remove().html();
[07:22:30] <Fox`> get still returns the object
[07:22:48] <Fox`> the actual cloning is already handled somewhere else
[07:28:05] <Xotix> How can i specify the return value of the paste event? E.g. so every paste returns "Hi" instead of its own content?
[07:28:31] <johnkpaul> "paste" isn't a normal browser event that you can hook into
[07:28:40] <johnkpaul> you can override control/command + V
[07:28:50] <johnkpaul> but you can't stop the edit menu -> paste operation
[07:28:58] <johnkpaul> what are you trying to do?
[07:31:02] <Xotix> Johnpaul http://tinyw.in/7ZVw	e.g. on stackoverflow comment, you can paste anything and it cleans it up.
[07:32:29] <Taloncor> Xotix: I am fairly sure that they bind to the change event for the textarea
[07:32:58] <johnkpaul> yeah, I think that it's a variety of hacks to mimic it - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2176861/javascript-get-clipboard-data-on-paste-event-cross-browser/2177059#2177059
[07:50:32] <devmikey> Is there a free jquery or JS plugin that lets you embed Quicktime movies that are still downloading?

[07:52:46] <rciovati> hi guys i need to change programmatically the form method. with 		$('#myform').attr("method", method); it works in chrome and ie8 but not in firefox. any idea or trick and i can use for changing the form method in firefox?
[07:52:59] <chrisdev> morphine: duh, thanks
[07:53:21] <morphine> np :)
[07:59:01] <akahn> I have a form that I want to trigger an ajax request whenever the form changes. I can bind the change event to the form, but this doesn't cover text input (until the user blurs from a text field). what's a good strategy for working around this?
[07:59:07] <PrgmrBill> how would you write a selector that targets all images with a width greater than the viewport?
[07:59:40] <quicksilver> I'd use a filter.
[08:00:21] <jacof> Hi guys, I have a lil' question: how come when I use $.ajax({ url: http://example.com/?param=val ... }); it works perfectly, but when i try to use the data: { "param" : "val" } form, it doesn't ? btw, its an external url.
[08:00:25] <PrgmrBill> looks like exactly what I need. thanks quicksilver
[08:00:41] <quicksilver> $('img').filter(function(){if(this.width()>window.width()) {return true;} return false;});
[08:00:44] <quicksilver> something like that
[08:01:06] <quicksilver> well or just return this.width()>window.width()
[08:07:08] <poppiez> hi guys, I'm creating this modal dialog that goes on top of the content.

[08:10:41] <rathis> I have a 'loading' splash screen that is shown when a user clicks certain links on my website.  I use the show() method, and it works fine.  However, when I press the back button on an iPhone, the loading screen is there, obstructing the screen  (this does not occur in Chrome).  Does anyone know how/why this is happening, and if there is something I can do to prevent this from happening?
[08:11:43] <AdvoWork> i have a select menu, and am doing: $('#priority').change(function() {  yet it appears to do nothing. Any ideas please?
[08:12:34] <rathis> Sequence of events: page - user clicks link - loading splash show() - linked page loads - user presses back button - first page loads, with splash
[08:12:49] <Taloncor> AdvoWork: Provide a code example, pls.
[08:13:48] <rathis> I'm assuming it has something to do with the way Mobile Safari caches pages, but I'm not sure.

[08:16:44] <theBrettman> I'm getting back [object Object]? http://jsbin.com/ifavej/edit#javascript,live
[08:17:27] <koden> hey all I have an iframe that on click an alert box should pop up, it can be anywhere on the iframe I don't care where they click
[08:17:29] <theBrettman> there's got to be a better way to do this
[08:18:05] <koden> the iframe is just an embedded youtube video, so basically when they click to play it the pop up should come up
[08:18:08] <koden> any help?
[08:18:39] <theBrettman> ur code has to be in the iframe
[08:19:34] <Taloncor> AdvoWork: First of all: Buggy code. Missing }); at the end.
[08:19:34] <Taloncor> Second: You have to bind the 'change' to the select and not to the individual options
[08:19:48] <ericandrewlewis> is there some kinda browser extension to see some jQuery debugging info?
[08:20:15] <theBrettman> depends which browser ur using
[08:20:23] <ericandrewlewis> wondering if you can see what event listeners are attached to elementsâ€¦probably not but would be rad
[08:20:26] <AdvoWork> Taloncor, just seen that, doh
[08:20:55] <theBrettman> anyone can tell me if there's a better way to do this? http://jsbin.com/ifavej/edit#javascript,live
[08:21:28] <theBrettman> if u click, u will see it's returning [object Object]
[08:21:53] <Kambfhase> alert() is not a debugger
[08:22:06] <theBrettman> says u
[08:22:19] <koden> theBrettman, I'm not trying to manipulate anything within the iframe I just need the click of it no matter what to just pop up
[08:22:40] <theBrettman> koden, doesn't matter
[08:23:01] <theBrettman> it's a whole nother document
[08:23:05] <TeddyMurray> hi i have a shadow box with two radio buttons that need events but the events are not triggering
[08:23:05] <koden> so basically impossible
[08:23:08] <TeddyMurray> does shadowbox disable it?
[08:23:08] <TeddyMurray> http://newfrontend.abewebtesting.com/landlords#hidden
[08:23:11] <theBrettman> not impossible
[08:23:32] <theBrettman> there's a tutorial in stackoverflow maybe I can find
[08:23:33] <TeddyMurray> any ideas?
[08:24:18] <Kambfhase> theBrettman: there is a wrong parenthesis on the append <input> line
[08:25:02] <theBrettman> gah, no wonder!
[08:25:10] <theBrettman> good eye
[08:25:22] <Kambfhase> theBrettman: this works: http://jsbin.com/ifavej/3/edit
[08:26:27] <theBrettman> koden, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9034672/is-there-any-way-to-get-global-events-when-working-with-nested-iframes
[08:26:48] <koden> thx theBrettman
[08:28:16] <TeddyMurray> any ideas for my issue
[08:28:24] <TeddyMurray> http://newfrontend.abewebtesting.com/landlords#hidden the events arent working on the shadowbox
[08:30:01] <theBrettman> I still get [object Object] http://jsbin.com/ifavej/4/edit
[08:30:25] <Kambfhase> theBrettman: did you look at the link i gave you?
[08:31:15] <Kambfhase> TeddyMurray: 'not working' is an invalid problem description
[08:31:23] <TeddyMurray> ......................................................................
[08:31:28] <TeddyMurray> i gave a description
[08:31:54] <Kambfhase> Why do you load three different versions of jQuery?
[08:32:01] <theBrettman> which radio buttons?
[08:32:04] <Kambfhase> plsu three different versions of jQUI?
[08:32:44] <theBrettman> that won't cause conflicts (sarcasm)
[08:34:42] <theBrettman> so anyone looking at my problem? http://jsbin.com/ifavej/4/edit just click and see
[08:35:55] <Kambfhase> theBrettman: this works for me: http://jsbin.com/ifavej/5/edit#source
[08:36:25] <theBrettman> cool
[08:36:26] <theBrettman> thx
[08:36:52] <theBrettman> ah, add
[08:37:06] <Kambfhase> yeah
[08:37:20] <theBrettman> and the array on x, ok
[08:37:22] <Kambfhase> plus x now is a jQ array, not a String
[08:37:37] <theBrettman> some how I think there's an easier way to do this but idk
[08:37:44] <theBrettman> or a more efficient way
[08:38:21] <Kambfhase> .clone() might speed things up. But hey, it works!
[08:38:36] <theBrettman> I should probably make it a widget cuz it's gonna be reused
[08:38:36] <Kambfhase> never change a running system ;)
[08:39:22] <ZadYree> Hum I've got a problem: There are 3 forme, an only one is starting the jQuery: http://pastebin.com/zvr6THKB
[08:40:08] <Kambfhase> ?validid @ ZadYree
[08:40:08] <bot-t1> ZadYree, ID attributes must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods ("."). http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#h-6.2 - furthermore, IDs are unique, meaning only one element in the DOM can have a given ID at any time
[08:40:37] <fof> ^use unique IDs
[08:41:09] <ZadYree> hum so I hav to make several jQuery calls? I'm a bit lost
[08:41:20] <theBrettman> depends on what ur trying to do
[08:41:20] <chee> more things are valid in IDs now :3
[08:41:40] <theBrettman> don't see any script so... we have no clue
[08:42:31] <ZadYree> Trying to change the id syntax
[08:43:02] <fof> they can share a class
[08:43:13] <ZadYree> As I am generating them with a framework, I can't make unique jQuery function names
[08:43:19] <ZadYree> ah ok
[08:45:18] <chee> #â˜­ { background-color: red }
[08:45:53] <ZadYree> Well, then how may I refer to prepare_down to make Javascript catch the query?
[08:47:31] <fof> you mean how can you select one or more of the tables?
[08:48:13] <Kambfhase> you should really change the IDs of your form.
[08:48:56] <ZadYree> yup
[08:49:25] <ZadYree> I'm looking out how to catch the request using class
[08:49:29] <fof> form*, you want to catch submit on them?
[08:49:33] <heeton> I'd like to find out what issues I might upgrading a 1.5.1 app to 1.7
[08:49:47] <heeton> Do we have a change log or deprecation list or anything?
[08:50:02] <heeton> (I understand the minor releases shouldn't remove features, but want to make sure)
[08:51:19] <AdvoWork> can i not do, function test(customerid, priority = 1) { }  so its like the default?
[08:52:41] <MagePsycho> guys.. can you help me to list the top 3 jQuery slider plugin?
[08:53:30] <ZadYree> yup fof
[08:54:48] <Kambfhase> AdvoWork: nope.
[08:55:19] <Kambfhase> you can do priority = priority || 1 though.
[08:56:30] <dethkrieg> Question regarding JQuery UI Autocomplete. Say I return a remote call as JSON. Can I store this in a Javascript variable and use that as the source for my autocomplete?
[08:57:05] <pifantastic> dethkrieg: yes, that should be possible
[08:57:27] <dethkrieg> how do i tell autocomplete that it's JSON vs an Array
[08:57:40] <dethkrieg> when you use a variable, it seems to want an array
[08:57:42] <AdvoWork> Kambfhase, thanks for the tip
[08:57:48] <Kambfhase> np
[08:57:55] <dethkrieg> unless there is a quick and easy way to convert JSON to Array
[08:58:08] <Kambfhase> $.parseJSON() ?
[08:58:14] <dethkrieg> lemme give that a shot
[08:58:51] <pifantastic> dethkrieg: you may have to "transform" the data in your JSON to something autocomplete expects
[08:58:55] <pifantastic> but that's an easy thing to do
[09:00:11] <fof> ZadYree: http://alpha.jsfiddle.net/saYY6/
[09:00:18] <ZadYree> ty!
[09:00:44] <fof> i changed the IDs and set the class attribute in the html
[09:01:41] <fof> sorry this is better http://alpha.jsfiddle.net/saYY6/1/
[09:11:08] <MagePsycho> guys.. can you help me to list the top 3 jQuery slider plugin?
[09:13:29] <Eviltwin> Depends on what you mean by "slider"
[09:13:43] <Eviltwin> I take that to mean something you use to set a value by dragging a little box back and forth
[09:14:12] <Eviltwin> In which case I don't go any further than jQuery UI's slider
[09:14:38] <Eviltwin> Some people (for whatever reason) use that as a term for a slideshow where the images slide
[09:14:51] <Eviltwin> In which case I've yet to see one I'm completely happy with
[09:14:55] <dwarder> why this code http://pastebin.com/5FE3FYuW gives me Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input
[09:15:37] <dwarder> i've closed everything properly
[09:15:46] <dwarder> i.e. } ]
[09:15:47] <Eviltwin> Count the number of ('s
[09:15:50] <Eviltwin> Count the number of )'s
[09:15:58] <Eviltwin> Subtract the latter from the former
[09:16:15] <Taloncor> And you didn't closed everything properly
[09:16:16] <dwarder> Eviltwin: ohh now i see
[09:16:19] <dwarder> Eviltwin: thank you
[09:16:25] <dwarder> Taloncor: yup
[09:18:06] <pendlepants> does anyone have any experience making cross-domain ajax calls using Access-Control-Allow-Origin with jquery?
[09:18:21] <MagePsycho> Eviltwin: yeahh slideshow with lots of option which slides not only images but also html content
[09:18:38] <pendlepants> I can get it to work if the requesting domain is localhost, but not if I give it another name like something.dev/
[09:20:25] <chovy> .
[09:20:42] <chovy> pendlepants: i have.
[09:20:52] <heeton> Is there a deprecation log or anything? I'd like to know what's changed between 1.5 and 1.7
[09:21:24] <Kambfhase> there are changelogs at the jquery blog
[09:21:38] <chovy> pendlepants: your resource on the other domain needs to server that header.
[09:22:13] <chovy> pendlepants: Access-Control-Allow-Credentials true
[09:22:21] <chovy> Access-Control-Allow-Origin *
[09:22:27] <chovy> try those two headers.
[09:23:32] <chovy> .
[09:23:38] <pendlepants> chovy: that was it; I was missing Access-Control-Allow-Credentials.
[09:26:22] <diverdude> if i add a clickhandler to a specific css-class called myclass and later, after i added the  handler i append a new html tag with css class myclass....the handler does not apply to the newly added element. Is there a way that i can make jquery append handlers automatically to new elements or do i have to do the book keeping myself?
[09:28:45] <Zzaichik> ?.on() @diverdude
[09:28:47] <bot-t1> diverdude, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:29:03] <diverdude> Zzaichik, what about live() ?
[09:29:15] <Zzaichik> .live() has been deprecated.
[09:29:42] <Zzaichik> So I guess if you're using an older version of jQuery than .live() will work..
[09:30:04] <chovy> diverdude: .live()
[09:30:24] <chovy> .live() still works in 1.7.1 but rewally .on() should be used instead.
[09:30:38] <diverdude> i see
[09:31:12] <diverdude> any drawbacks using on all the time instead of different bind() aliases such as click()?
[09:31:30] <Zzaichik> my bad, I didn't think .live would even work in 1.7+
[09:31:55] <chovy> diverdude: well the element needs to be present at the time you create the event handler, .on() allows you to attach it to something higher up, and specifcy a dynamic target to match on.
[09:32:01] <jomofcw> Is there a way to get the element "created" (cloned in fact) by the wrapAll method ? please.
[09:32:47] <chovy> diverdude: if it's a static target, then .click() is fine.
[09:34:05] <diverdude> im using http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.min.js right now...whats the google link to newest jquery version ?
[09:34:26] <chovy> jquery /1/
[09:34:51] <chovy> that will always give you the latest.
[09:34:55] <quizme> anybody here  use "thejit" graphing library with Jquery?
[09:35:08] <quizme> how do u get JQuery not to conflict with thejit ?
[09:35:24] <Zzaichik> 1.7.1 is the latest? I think?
[09:35:24] <diverdude> chovy, oh nice...so path is https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/ ?
[09:35:24] <chovy> quizme: wrap your jquery code like this:
[09:35:40] <chovy> (function($){  //jquery stuff })(jQuery);
[09:35:48] <chovy> diverdude: yes
[09:36:08] <quizme> chovy:  but thejit redefines "$"
[09:36:27] <chovy> quizme: you pass it in as jQuery this way, and $ will reference jQuery
[09:36:34] <quizme> chovy: and overwrites some of the same methods in $
[09:36:55] <quizme> chovy: like $.extend is redefined by thejit
[09:37:54] <hurry_> how can i add handler in runtime ?
[09:37:59] <quizme> chovy: so if i load jquery and then load thejit, thejit will blow out jqueryies versions.
[09:38:59] <chovy> quizme: did you try my suggestion?
[09:39:10] <quizme> chovy: yes i did before I came to this channel.
[09:39:41] <quizme> chovy: won't the definitions of those functions be blown away at load time?
[09:40:36] <chovy> it's not a good idea to use two diff. libraries.
[09:41:27] <chovy> why doesn't wrapping it in a closure work?
[09:41:37] <hurry_> can i write php inside success $.ajax() ?
[09:41:57] <quizme> chovy: cuz the globals get overwritten before the closure is made.
[09:43:19] <BFranks> Hey .. I had some elements in a logo that folks were arguing about.. So I made both items 'draggable' which was cool cause now folks can arrange the logo however they like and send me a screenshot.. Nifty beans! Sadly there's also a navigation bar above the logo, and I think the Z-index of the draggable items is 'covering' the nav bar buttons ?
[09:43:28] <chovy> quizme can you provide a jsfiddle?
[09:43:51] <chovy> with both libraries?
[09:44:08] <chovy> and an example of what gets clobbered by the jit?
[09:46:34] <chovy> hurry_: why would you want to do that?
[09:47:22] <hurry_> i want that, when i click a button, hide a div that name is class="foo_1" where 1 is id Db
[09:47:47] <Ortund> how can I get/set the value attribute of <input type="text" /> ??
[09:47:52] <hurry_> can i write foo <?php $_GET['id']; ?> for exaple
[09:48:03] <hurry_> in success
[09:48:05] <chovy> $("input").val('foo');
[09:48:50] <hurry_> why input?, it's a button than hide a div
[09:49:12] <chovy> hurry_: that was for Ortund
[09:49:19] <hurry_> ops :)
[09:49:24] <hurry_> each div have button , when click the button, hide inerith div
[09:49:26] <Ortund> chovy, $('#txt_query').val() returns undefined
[09:49:39] <chovy> are you sure it's set?
[09:50:02] <diverdude> chovy, hmm i tried using the live and it only works on old elements...not ones i add dynamically
[09:50:31] <chovy> diverdude: jsfiddle?
[09:50:35] <BFranks> Yeah I have an image with a higher z-index overlapping an image with a lower z-index, and changing the z-index doesn't seem to help?? So odd..
[09:50:37] <diverdude> chovy, like this: $(".chatbox h1").on('click',function(e){collapseChat(this,e);});
[09:51:04] <Ortund> chovy, I have no idea
[09:51:16] <chovy> Ortund: put a jsfiddle up.
[09:51:28] <chovy> anyone wants me to debug their code, use jsfiddle.net
[09:52:01] <chovy> diverdude: is .chatbox h1 static?
[09:52:17] <diverdude> chovy, what do you mean with static?
[09:52:38] <chovy> diverdude: are those h1's loaded dyanmically?
[09:53:00] <chovy> $(document).on('click', '.chatbox h1 ', fn);
[09:53:11] <chovy> $(document).on('click', '.chatbox h1', fn);
[09:53:56] <nFFF> $('.chatbox h1').click(function() { }); should work
[09:54:05] <srj55> I want transition iframe src's on a full screen page.  I would like to be able to seamlessly slide out the old one and slide in the new one.  Do I need to wrap these in DIVs to use the jquery UI effects?  I'm getting some weird effects where they slide in then flash off and back on.
[09:54:06] <diverdude> nFFF, no
[09:54:15] <chovy> nFFF: i think he's dynamically adding h1's or .chatbox to the dom.
[09:54:36] <jomofcw> is there a way to disable the CSS templating when i call the UI tabs() method plz ?
[09:54:59] <Ortund> chovy: http://jsfiddle.net/J6HTb/
[09:55:17] <nFFF> I don't think binding to document will work
[09:55:29] <nFFF> But you can try
[09:55:37] <diverdude> chovy, ahh that did the tricj
[09:55:40] <diverdude> trick
[09:55:45] <chovy> Ortund: http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/J6HTb/1/
[09:55:51] <nFFF> Fair enough :>>
[09:56:01] <diverdude> nFFF, why shouldn't that work?
[09:56:07] <chovy> diverdude: you can replace $(document) with something lower down, as long it's present when you define the handler.
[09:56:38] <diverdude> chovy, ahh ok i see...then it only has to watch the element im binding it to=?
[09:56:39] <Ortund> that works chovy, but how can I get it cleared when I click on the input?
[09:56:41] <nFFF> I thought you couldn't bind for dyanmically loaded content in jQuery
[09:57:02] <chovy> Ortund: you're expecting id not name in your code. but the input doesn't have the id.
[09:57:28] <chovy> nFFF: sure you can.
[09:57:29] <LukeNukem> hi can some one help me :>
[09:57:40] <chovy> LukeNukem: ?
[09:57:49] <Ortund> derp, thanks man
[09:58:15] <LukeNukem> i want users to be able to click a link or button and it should add  a browse button below textarea
[09:58:16] <diverdude> ChoiZ, ohh guy thats sooo groovy man :D bound it to the container and works like a charm...hells yah :D
[09:59:38] <chovy> diverdude: the 2nd argument is a selector that matches e.target when the event is triggered.
[09:59:57] <fg-> do you think jQuery.extend would be a good idea for doing "class inheritance" ?
[10:00:18] <chovy> fg-: i would go with john resig's class creation script.
[10:00:26] <diverdude> chovy, relative to where i bound on?
[10:00:32] <chovy> diverdude: yes
[10:00:57] <chovy> so if you bind to document. it checks e.target against the 2nd arg. and if it matches, then it fires.
[10:01:04] <diverdude> chovy, aha so i could do 	$("#chatpanel").on('click',"h1",function(e){collapseChat(this,e);}); instead
[10:01:06] <fg-> chovy: http://www.crockford.com/javascript/inheritance.html ?
[10:01:20] <chovy> diverdude: yes. assuming #chatpanel is present.
[10:01:27] <chovy> and the h1 is loaded later, that's fine.
[10:01:39] <LukeNukem> chovy, how can i achieve this
[10:01:40] <fg-> sorry, john resig
[10:01:54] <fg-> i read the wrong name
[10:02:08] <diverdude> chovy, and using a relative selector is not as expensive as using a global selector right?
[10:02:09] <chovy> LukeNukem: paste a fiddle.
[10:02:22] <LukeNukem> chovy, i dont have any code written except for html and php now
[10:02:30] <chovy> it's relative to the 1st selector.
[10:02:55] <LukeNukem> im not very good at jquery, not good at alll....
[10:02:55] <chovy> obviously if you click something higher up, it won't fire at all.
[10:02:58] <LukeNukem> sooo
[10:03:00] <Kambfhase> $.extend is not inheriting.
[10:03:36] <chovy> LukeNukem: ok.
[10:03:45] <chovy> not much i can do if you don't provdie an example.
[10:04:22] <LukeNukem> um, i want js or jquery(js) to add a browse button when a link is clicked thats all.
[10:04:43] <diverdude> LukeNukem, so just create it?
[10:04:49] <LukeNukem> i dont know how :(
[10:04:59] <diverdude> LukeNukem, come on...thats easy
[10:05:12] <chovy> seriously.
[10:05:23] <LukeNukem> tell me what to google atleast, im not familiar with js terms
[10:05:25] <chovy> you know, you could hire someone on odesk to do that.
[10:05:39] <LukeNukem> no.
[10:05:44] <nFFF> Kambfhase, is there much difference between copying a class and inherinence?
[10:05:58] <Kambfhase> yes.
[10:06:01] <diverdude> LukeNukem, why not?
[10:06:22] <Kambfhase> if you just copy, later changes will not be recognised.
[10:06:25] <diverdude> LukeNukem, ill do it for 50 bucks :D
[10:06:26] <LukeNukem> because i have no money to pay.

[10:07:16] <Kambfhase> lol, bot-t1 that wasnt useful ;)
[10:08:02] <hurry_> can i add .click handler when create a button ?
[10:08:28] <dasim01> You can use .click handlers on objects that exist at the time the dom was created
[10:09:01] <dasim01> If you dynamically add a button you'll need to use something like .on() or .delegate()
[10:09:42] <hurry_> dasim01: thanks
[10:10:10] <Kambfhase> dasim01: or you can add a .click() handler after you have a reference to the button.

[10:11:35] <rubyruy> is there a way to check for elements inside a container with a selector that includes parent elments outside said container?
[10:11:55] <LukeNukem> chovy, can you add //comments please? :) so i can understand?
[10:12:08] <ajpiano> rubyruy: the easiest way to check if one element contains another is to use see ?jQuery.contains
[10:12:09] <bot-t1> rubyruy, jQuery.contains(container, contained): Check to see if a DOM element is within another DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[10:12:11] <hky_PhillipSenn> Have I missed all the yayQuery podcasts since 5/2010?
[10:12:29] <rubyruy> er not exactly.... let me illustrate with an example
[10:13:01] <ajpiano> hky_PhillipSenn: we haven't released a new one in a long time
[10:13:08] <ajpiano> i don't know which ones you've actually seens
[10:13:23] <chovy> LukeNukem: http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/MEBNe/
[10:13:39] <rubyruy> say I have "form.multi_form select[name=conjunction]"...  say I have var element = $("form.multi_form"), if I say element.find("form.multi_form select[name=conjunction]") that will not match anything as there is no form.multiform inside the reference element
[10:13:44] <LukeNukem> are we calling the function e?
[10:13:51] <LukeNukem> is that what the function is named
[10:14:00] * Eviltwin starts youDontSayQuery
[10:14:10] <ajpiano> LukeNukem: no, it's an anonymous function, that receives an event object as a parameter
[10:14:25] <chovy> LukeNukem: no, that's a parameter to the anonymous function
[10:14:33] <ajpiano> rubyruy: right, that's not news to anyone
[10:14:33] <chovy> that's the event.
[10:15:02] <LukeNukem> ok
[10:15:04] <LukeNukem> what is "a"
[10:15:09] <Eviltwin> A word
[10:15:10] <chovy> rubyruy: just drop the form.mult_form on your find()
[10:15:10] <LukeNukem> then <a href...
[10:15:15] <quizme> chovy: http://jsfiddle.net/thirdreplicator/DQTdy/3/
[10:15:18] <ajpiano> LukeNukem: do you know what CSS selectors are?
[10:16:00] <rubyruy> yeah so is there another lookup method that will match according accoridng to parents all the way up to the docroot as well, but still filter the results to children?
[10:16:13] <rubyruy> er i guess i could just do it in two ops
[10:16:17] <quizme> what does "no wrap (body)" mean in js fiddle ?
[10:16:22] <LukeNukem> nope.
[10:16:25] <Eviltwin> quizme: The jsFiddles pasted here should actually have your JavaScript/jQuery in the fiddle
[10:16:27] <LukeNukem> i mean
[10:16:33] <LukeNukem> we select using id or name
[10:16:34] <LukeNukem> in css
[10:16:35] <rubyruy> no i can't drop the prefix :/
[10:16:37] <ajpiano> LukeNukem: see ?jqf
[10:16:37] <bot-t1> LukeNukem, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[10:16:38] <Eviltwin> That's kind of the point
[10:16:45] <ajpiano> LukeNukem: you can also select by tag name in css
[10:16:49] <ajpiano> "a" selects all anchor tags
[10:16:50] <LukeNukem> oh
[10:16:52] <LukeNukem> yes
[10:16:54] <LukeNukem> like .a
[10:16:56] <LukeNukem> or .textarea
[10:16:58] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[10:17:01] <Eviltwin> Those are classes
[10:17:04] <ajpiano> nope those are...
[10:17:06] <Eviltwin> Class selectors
[10:17:32] <quizme> eviltwin: the question is about library loading, so should i put thejit.js in there ?
[10:17:49] <Eviltwin> quizme: You should but the code that you want us to help you with in there
[10:17:51] <ajpiano> quizme: no wrap body means it doesn't do any wrapping of the code you provide and inserts it all in the bototm of the body
[10:17:57] <Eviltwin> Not <script src="..."></script> references to it
[10:18:06] <Eviltwin> If you do that, you're missing the point
[10:18:13] <quizme> eviltwin ok
[10:18:20] <Eviltwin> Additionally, I'll ask you to see ?jdb
[10:18:20] <bot-t1> Additionally, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[10:18:24] <Eviltwin> Ha
[10:18:49] <Eviltwin> You should isolate your problem first
[10:19:20] <rubyruy> er is there a way to do filter an existing jQuery by weather or not it's contained in another jQuery?
[10:19:44] <rubyruy> from a DOM pov, not like, set intersection
[10:19:47] <chovy> quizme: http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/vymHF/
[10:19:48] <Eviltwin> rubyruy: First, learn some terminology
[10:20:00] <Eviltwin> $ is "jQuery"
[10:20:05] <rubyruy> a jQuery object
[10:20:07] <Eviltwin> $("a") returns a "jQuery object"
[10:20:08] <ajpiano> rubyruy: filter( elem )
[10:20:08] <rubyruy> as in, a collection
[10:20:26] <ajpiano> or filter( jqueryObject )
[10:21:19] <LukeNukem> chovy, i want to replace "a" with "#add_pic"
[10:21:21] <LukeNukem> but it does not work
[10:22:02] <chovy> <a href="#" id="add_pic">Add pic</a> ?
[10:22:18] <LukeNukem> oh damn, i used class
[10:22:24] <LukeNukem> how to make it worht with class
[10:22:25] <Eviltwin> *sigh*
[10:22:32] <chovy> LukeNukem: .add_pic
[10:22:45] <chovy> you should read about css selectors.
[10:22:51] <Eviltwin> LukeNukem: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[10:22:53] <rubyruy> ajpiano: that doesn't filter by ancestry - only direct elements
[10:23:03] <ajpiano> rubyruy: you're right, it doesn't
[10:23:08] <ajpiano> jquery doesn't read your mind
[10:23:19] <ajpiano> rubyruy: you can filter with a function as well
[10:23:20] <Eviltwin> I sure wish it did
[10:23:22] <ajpiano> or use .not()
[10:23:56] <LukeNukem> chovy, ok can you tell me now how to use jquery to get rid of the upload box?
[10:24:01] <ajpiano> $(".bar").filter(function() { return $(this).closest(".foo").length }) will give you all bars inside of foos
[10:24:12] <ajpiano> so would $(".foo .bar") but that's not the point i'm making :p
[10:25:17] <quizme> chovy: http://jsfiddle.net/thirdreplicator/DQTdy/6/
[10:25:33] <rubyruy> fair 'nuff
[10:25:43] <Eviltwin> Don't tell me you put an infinite loop in this
[10:26:23] <quizme> chovy: sorry ignore that one
[10:26:32] <Eviltwin> quizme: Dude, see ?jdb
[10:26:32] <bot-t1> quizme, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[10:27:28] <Eviltwin> There are 17,200+ lines of code here
[10:27:35] <quizme> eviltwin: that's what i'm saying
[10:27:47] <Eviltwin> 17,200 is a little bigger than a dozen
[10:28:05] <keith_hyfn> just checking in...jqueryui.com is down, right?
[10:28:13] <Eviltwin> ?down jqueryui.com

[10:29:48] <LukeNukem> like, when cancel link is clicked i want to remove the file input
[10:29:58] <ajpiano> LukeNukem: i highly suggest that you give a read through the jquery fundamentals book or another book

Can i pass them through the $(window).load(function() {$('.blueberry').blueberry(); } ); code or do I need to edit the .js file directly ?

[10:59:04] <eddiemonge> that is so disgusting to look at
[10:59:27] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[10:59:38] <jaffipaffi> Hmm.. Seems like load() have issues with large html file
[10:59:39] <jaffipaffi> s
[10:59:58] <jaffipaffi> It inserts small files just fine.. But with a larger one (33kb/660 lines), nothing is put into the div
[11:00:07] <jaffipaffi> It loads the ressource, but never inserts it into the div
[11:00:12] <jaffipaffi> Anyone else knowing about that?
[11:00:14] <Eviltwin> help0: http://jsfiddle.net/BHs6p/
[11:00:37] <Eviltwin> jaffipaffi: Why are you attempting to put 33kb of HTML into a page after load?
[11:00:50] <warren-lamz> Eviltwin: Beautiful.
[11:01:01] <eddiemonge> jaffipaffi: link? that should be fine
[11:01:21] <jaffipaffi> Eviltwin: It's not after load.. It's $('div').load(....)
[11:01:42] <jaffipaffi> It's because the page should dynamically get content after choosing an option in a select
[11:01:46] <help0> Eviltwin ok
[11:01:48] <jaffipaffi> eddiemonge: Prepping jsfiddle
[11:01:59] <Eviltwin> User actions usually happen after load
[11:02:45] <jaffipaffi> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/MWwXh/1/
[11:03:07] <jaffipaffi> Eviltwin: It's because fields shown (in a table) depends on what the user has chosen in the select.. See http://jsfiddle.net/MWwXh/1/
[11:03:11] <Eviltwin> jaffipaffi: Do you know what Same Origin Policy is?
[11:03:38] <jaffipaffi> Eviltwin: Yes. But this is on the same site ;) Just wanted you to show the code on jsfiddle
[11:03:42] <jaffipaffi> But it doesn't insert
[11:03:48] <Eviltwin> ...
[11:03:56] <Eviltwin> Obviously it doesn't work on jsFiddle
[11:04:49] <drummer306> jaffipaffi, might not be your issue, but that content your loading is a seperate html document
[11:05:18] <drummer306> loading a html document inside a html page already ?
[11:05:42] <jaffipaffi> Eviltwin: http://cms.101-odense.dk/test.html there ya go
[11:05:57] <jaffipaffi> Lol that works
[11:06:00] <jaffipaffi> Strange
[11:06:02] <jaffipaffi> Gonna look into it
[11:06:07] <Eviltwin> jaffipaffi fail
[11:06:13] <jaffipaffi> +1 :P
[11:06:25] <Eviltwin> I like that you actually linked it before testing it
[11:06:32] <eddiemonge> whoa onclick="$(this).parent().parent().parent().remove();return false;">
[11:07:57] <chovy> eddiemonge: that is awesome!
[11:07:58] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge: I'm amazed at just how bad the code gets that I see here
[11:08:37] <eddiemonge> did jaff leave?
[11:08:47] <Eviltwin> Like ajpiano's "I've seen <strike>it all</strike> a lot" on Fixing These jQuery
[11:10:48] <warren-lamz> I sometimes wish there was a separate chat just for beginner questions like "How do I hide an element?" to keep the noise down here. But who the hell would want to staff it?
[11:11:42] <eddiemonge> me
[11:13:36] <snover> obviously someone should submit an enhancement request so you can pass a number into parent so you can just have it loop-traverse up
[11:14:01] <kara_sweets> does anyone know how data is supposed to be past from a form like this ? http://jsfiddle.net/southerd/3aLea/7/
[11:14:11] <snover> sorry, I only know how to future data
[11:14:52] <ZadYree> I have got another problem: JS is no taking the good query: http://alpha.jsfiddle.net/saYY6/5/

[11:19:28] <ZadYree> omg i can't find out the difference :D
[11:19:51] <warren-lamz> ZadYree: It's this line             var label = $(this).find('input[name="label"]').val();
[11:19:59] <ZadYree> aaaah ty
[11:20:33] <Eviltwin> warren-lamz: Don't call people names here
[11:20:44] <eddiemonge> ZadYree: .val() returns one value. your previous query was looking at both forms and finding the input and returning both values from the forms
[11:20:49] <warren-lamz> Eviltwin: Noted.
[11:20:56] <ZadYree> ow I see
[11:20:59] <ZadYree> Thank you!
[11:21:15] <eddiemonge> darcyclarke is a wesbos

[11:22:41] <wesbos> wat
[11:26:27] <eddiemonge> oh i didnt mean you wes
[11:26:39] <eddiemonge> i was demonstrating how to properly call someone a name
[11:29:52] <chovy> .
[11:32:31] <darcyclarke> eddiemonge say wa?
[11:32:41] <eddiemonge> wa
[11:32:42] <darcyclarke> eddiemonge wesbos and I are one in the same
[11:32:54] <bartmax> which would be the delivery type of the known pizza delivery type ?
[11:33:11] <darcyclarke> var wesbos = $("#darcyclarke").clone();
[11:33:11] <bartmax> the name i mean
[11:33:37] <eddiemonge> lol
[11:33:45] <eddiemonge> bartmax: wtf?
[11:33:46] <darcyclarke> var darcyclarke = $("#wesbos").clone();
[11:33:51] <bartmax> :)
[11:34:29] <kara_sweets> hey guys, i want to put the following javascript in the head, however, the form doesnt exist when the javascript goes (i think) so it doesnt work, how would i get the javascript to load, after the form? http://jsfiddle.net/southerd/3aLea/7/
[11:34:32] <eddiemonge> darcyclarke: now that is just circular non-logic
[11:34:47] <darcyclarke> bartmax typeof(knownPizzaDeliveryType)
[11:35:01] <bartmax> I have 2 delivery types, the 'full van type' from 9:00 to 13:00 hours, but if you order something at 10:00 i cannot add to the shipment. But if the delivery type is 'pizza delivery' and the order is put at 10:00 i can add of course. (im not asking about JS nor jquery) :D
[11:35:02] <eddiemonge> ?ready @ kara_sweets
[11:35:03] <bot-t> kara_sweets, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[11:35:18] <rob_> hi, i want to create something like the old 'website builder' projects where i have a grid and can resize/move divs to design a custom layout, should i be able to do this with jquery/jqueryui or is there something better i should use?
[11:35:58] <eddiemonge> bartmax: again, wtf???
[11:36:11] <shlevy> Suppose x is a DOMElement and an ancestor of this. How do I select "All divs that are both immediate children of x and a parent of this"?
[11:36:17] <eddiemonge> rob_: you could....with a lot of work
[11:36:22] <bartmax> i need to define delivery types :) dont know the names
[11:36:39] <rob_> eddiemonge: is there a more recommended way to do it? just using 'sortable' seems to be the wrong approach i've found so far..
[11:36:45] <chovy> kara_sweets: wrap it $(function(){ //your code });
[11:36:54] <shlevy> Sorry, s/parent/ancestor above
[11:37:04] <shlevy> Suppose x is a DOMElement and an ancestor of this. How do I select "All divs that are both immediate children of x and an ancestor of this"?
[11:37:20] <eddiemonge> rob_: thats the wrong qquestion to ask. you are asking how to make a full-blown application. thats up to you to figure out
[11:37:21] <jacof> Hey. I'm doing $.ajax() and some stuff, and in the success: function(response) { } I want to use a variable that's been retrieved earlier in the overall function, and apparently its not passing through to the success handler. How should I do that ?
[11:37:33] <eddiemonge> bartmax: yet again, wtf???
[11:37:45] <chovy> shlevy: i think you would have to loop through all divs and check the ancestor.
[11:38:09] <shlevy> chovy: Boo, I was afraid someone would say that
[11:38:32] <chovy> shlevy: why not just do this $(".parent div") ?
[11:38:43] <eddiemonge> shlevy: that sounds like .parent() to me
[11:39:15] <eddiemonge> jacof: that sounds right so you must be doing something wrong. is the variable in the same scope as the ajax call?
[11:39:22] <shlevy> chovy: It would be $(".parent > div"), but I can't guarantee any attributes of parent
[11:39:52] <rob_> eddiemonge: ok, thanks, i think the draggable demo proves i might be able to do it using jquery :)
[11:39:56] <chovy> shlevy: what do you mean? You have no way of knowing which parents you want?
[11:39:56] <eddiemonge> shlevy: `this` would only have 1 parent that is an immediate child of an ancestor
[11:39:58] <darcyclarke> jacof this should help you bro: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/inettuts/
[11:40:28] <darcyclarke> oops
[11:40:30] <darcyclarke> wrong person
[11:40:36] <shlevy> chovy: All I know is that x has been set to the relevant DOMElement. So I can run functions on x, but I can't guarantee that it has a given class or id or anything
[11:40:37] <eddiemonge> darcyclarke: dont be trying to steal my thunder
[11:40:41] <darcyclarke> rob_ http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/inettuts/
[11:41:02] <rob_> darcyclarke: oooh, thanks :)
[11:41:06] <darcyclarke> :P
[11:41:08] <eddiemonge> shlevy: why dont you describe what the actual problem you are facing is instead of trying to give us solutions to a different one
[11:41:09] <darcyclarke> no problemo
[11:41:31] <jacof> eddiemonge: the ids variable is defined earlier. monitorIds(ids) function is called with it. monitorIds does $.ajax(); some stuff is made within the success function, but inside it, I've lost the ids variable. I can use it freely inside monitorIds though.
[11:41:32] <ezioa> how do you select elements with more than one attribute constraint?
[11:41:53] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ jacof
[11:41:53] <bot-t> jacof, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:42:10] <jacof> :/
[11:42:41] <eddiemonge> ezioa: like what?
[11:43:06] <ezioa> selected=selected name=blah
[11:44:03] <eddiemonge> ?filter @ ezioa
[11:44:04] <bot-t> ezioa, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[11:44:28] <jacof> solved it by declaring it as a global
[11:46:12] <kara_sweets> i wrapped http://jsfiddle.net/southerd/3aLea/7/ in a $(document).ready(function () { , however still not loading
[11:47:13] <eddiemonge> jacof: that is very rarely the right solution
[11:47:19] <darcyclarke> kara_sweets you need to include the jquery library
[11:47:45] <darcyclarke> kara_sweets in the left sidebar there's a dropdown for libraries, choose the latest version of jquery
[11:49:07] <jacof> eddiemonge: actually, defining it as local inside the function is enough.
[11:49:53] <eddiemonge> jacof: thats what i said. you needed it to be in the same scope as the ajax call
[11:51:41] <jacof> eddiemonge: sorry I didn't know what you meant by that. i looked it up and that was it
[11:52:15] <eddiemonge> kara_sweets: http://jsfiddle.net/3aLea/14/
[11:52:32] <eddiemonge> jacof: you should learn about scope if you want to write javascript
[11:52:38] <jacof> now the problem is that i have to do a double assignment, and set up a local variable inside the function, but its just a line really so i guess thats ok
[11:53:38] <eddiemonge> jacof: i find pasting the code you are working with helpful for other trying to help you
[11:54:49] <orentanay> I have a ul w/ several nested ULs, I have an A tag that I've added, and now I want to find the UL that is at the same level as my A tag, and not any of the UL parents or children. Find and Closest seem to crawl up the DOM tree, so what is your recommendation to find the parallel UL? thanks.
[11:55:10] <Kambfhase> ?siblings
[11:55:10] <bot-t> .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[11:55:41] <initself> $('#contact_notes').submit(function() { console.log($('textarea[name="notes"]').val()); return false; });
[11:55:53] <initself> that is gonna give me any textarea on the page with the name notes
[11:56:05] <orentanay> testing now Kambfhase, thanks.
[11:56:12] <initself> is there a way to use $(this) to refer only to textareas in my current form?
[11:56:32] <Kambfhase> ?find @ initself
[11:56:32] <bot-t> initself, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[11:57:49] <initself> does this look good?
[11:57:50] <initself> console.log($(this).find('textarea[name="notes"]').val());
[11:57:53] <initself> it seemed to work
[11:58:26] <Kambfhase> :)
[11:58:26] <initself> is there a way to refer to the name only without mind for whether or not it is a textarea?
[11:58:47] <initself> just remove "textarea"?
[11:58:49] * initself tries.
[11:58:53] <Kambfhase> ?TIAS
[11:58:54] <bot-t> Try It And See
[11:58:55] <Eviltwin> It's ill-advised
[11:59:05] <initself> ok, it works
[11:59:11] <Eviltwin> .find('[name="notes"]') is the same thing as .find('*[name="notes"]')
[11:59:13] <initself> why does referring to its form type important?
[11:59:27] <eddiemonge> initself: you should be using a class instead
[11:59:33] <Eviltwin> Which means find every element inside the container and then filter
[11:59:38] <initself> Eviltwin: yes, but (this).find() means only inside of that form, right?
[11:59:47] <initself> ie. not the whole page?
[12:00:01] <Eviltwin> Yes
[12:00:08] <initself> Ok, cool.
[12:00:47] <initself> Kambfhase++
[12:02:01] <diverdude> if i add a class which has already been added, will it add it 2 times or just dont do anything else?
[12:05:03] <Kambfhase> ?TIAS @ diverdude
[12:05:04] <bot-t> diverdude, Try It And See
[12:11:35] <diverdude> is there a way to check if any of a containers children has a specific class?
[12:11:59] <ajpiano> diverdude: $("#container").find(".whatever").length
[12:12:00] <nFFF> diverdude, ('.container').find('.class')
[12:13:29] <sweb> http://jsbin.com/epasob
[12:13:36] <sweb> plugin not affected
[12:13:56] <eddiemonge> what ajpiano said
[12:14:55] <sweb> any one ?
[12:14:55] <eddiemonge> sweb: thats not the proper use see ? getting started with plugins
[12:14:56] <bot-t> sweb, Tutorials:Getting Started with jQuery - Goes through the basics of jQuery, all the way up to building plugins. http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[12:15:15] <eddiemonge> sweb: look at your console on that page
[12:16:11] <sweb> i use this
[12:16:11] <sweb> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[12:16:22] <sweb> eddiemonge: ^
[12:16:24] <RoastedBeef> diverdude: if ($("#container",$("#container-parent-div")).find(".stuff").size() != 0){}
[12:16:43] <RoastedBeef> add a $("#container-parent-div") context if you're hardcore about browser speed
[12:16:49] <diverdude> ajpiano, hmm i cant seem to make that work. if i do console.log($(e.target).children()); it prints:  [span.closeChat, span.minimizeChat] and if i do console.log($(e.target).find('minimizeChat')); it prints [] or 0 if i print the length
[12:17:12] <sweb> eddiemonge: is it false ?
[12:17:21] <ajpiano> diverdude: "minimizeChat" is a class, you need a period before it
[12:18:25] <diverdude> ahh ofc
[12:18:26] <diverdude> thx
[12:18:29] <diverdude> works now :)
[12:19:51] <eddiemonge> sweb: see http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Context
[12:20:23] <eddiemonge> RoastedBeef: if you have an ID you dont need context. and never ever use .size()
[12:21:05] <RoastedBeef> eddiemonge: thanks
[12:21:17] <eddiemonge> sometimes i miss -OT'ing it
[12:21:57] <ajpiano> you left :p
[12:22:14] <eddiemonge> i know. but im having withdrawals. maybe i was a bit too hasty
[12:24:09] <muzone> At my side menu at http://alpha.jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/FHZMd/11/ how do I hide lists with class "hidden"?
[12:24:40] <sweb> eddiemonge: i want to use somthing like $.myplugin('myStringData');
[12:24:55] <nFFF> muzone, $('li:hidden')?
[12:25:01] <sweb> not $(object).myplugin();
[12:25:40] <eddiemonge> muzone: CSS: .hidden { display: none }
[12:25:40] <nFFF> muzone, err 'li.hidden'
[12:25:48] <muzone> oh
[12:26:17] <eddiemonge> sweb: to accomplish what?
[12:26:39] <sweb> eddiemonge: procces string
[12:26:46] <sweb> process*
[12:26:56] <eddiemonge> sweb: like?
[12:27:02] <muzone> what i mean is
[12:28:01] <sweb>  eddiemonge: i found it tnx
[12:28:06] <sweb> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/data.js

[12:28:15] <imsky> what a wednesday
[12:28:16] <tetradon> Hello everyone
[12:28:16] <bot-t> (42 hours 6 mins ago) <abjorn> tell imsky WHERE R U DAWG?
[12:28:17] <bot-t> (42 hours 6 mins ago) <abjorn> tell imsky STOP BEING NOT HERE
[12:28:21] <imsky> right
[12:28:57] <eddiemonge> sweb: the reason im asking is that you most likely arent/shouldnt be using $.() for what you want
[12:29:40] <muzone> In my side menu at http://alpha.jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/FHZMd/11/ why won't the show/hide JS in the items under "Narrow by" work?
[12:29:43] <eddiemonge> sweb: this is what extend does: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[12:29:48] <someprimetime> when using slideToggle(), is there a first click and second click option for it? like how hover is like .hover(function() { }, function() {}); ?
[12:31:09] <tetradon> Does anyone know if it's possible to make a div or image glow in jQuery?
[12:31:22] <damd> tetradon: it is possible, but define "glow"
[12:31:47] <tetradon> damd: I'm essentially trying to get a lamp post to glow on a website
[12:32:20] <tetradon> I just need some kind of effect that can mimic a glowing effect for a light bulb
[12:32:26] <rue> Glow as in have some sort of a luminosity aura?
[12:32:36] <rue> And just changing the image isn't an option, presumably
[12:32:36] <damd> you could use a PNG with transparency and then set the CSS opacity of that
[12:32:37] <RoastedBeef> you'd need two images don't you? one glowing and one not
[12:32:48] <eddiemonge> muzone: why are you using links instead of labels? and you need a see? preventDefault
[12:33:16] <tetradon> rue: right, I would need to create a luminosity aura
[12:33:34] <tetradon> RoastedBeef: I'm trying to avoid using two images
[12:34:07] <eddiemonge> tetradon: its going to be hard then
[12:34:27] <nFFF> muzone
[12:34:29] <nFFF> http://alpha.jsfiddle.net/FHZMd/12/
[12:34:30] <muzone> eddiemonge: aaah great i didnt notice that, awesome
[12:34:34] <RoastedBeef> you can use one, and switch the css sprite position
[12:34:51] <RoastedBeef> ie, a 50x50 div with a 100x50 image background
[12:35:01] <RoastedBeef> image containing both image
[12:35:03] <muzone> nFFF: whats this? :D
[12:35:31] <DEADB33F> Quick question, which will be quicker over 500 ish elements.... $('a[href$="'+ str +'"]') ...or... $('a:contains("'+ str +'")') ..?
[12:35:37] <tetradon> RoastedBeef: I'm trying to create a visual effect that looks like an actual bulb glowing
[12:35:38] <nFFF> it collapses the menu :P
[12:35:56] <RoastedBeef> tetradon: ok, that's beyond me, good luck :)
[12:35:57] <eddiemonge> DEADB33F: those are different selectors
[12:36:03] <DEADB33F> where the link text is the same as the last part of the url
[12:36:08] <tetradon> RoastedBeef: alright, thanks lol
[12:36:14] <muzone> eddiemonge: whats this see? preventDefault you speak of?
[12:36:20] <eddiemonge> DEADB33F: see jsperf.com
[12:36:35] <DEADB33F> Yeah I know, eg:  <a href="domain/path/page">page</a>
[12:36:37] <eddiemonge> ? preventDefault @ muzone
[12:36:37] <bot-t> muzone, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[12:40:49] <muzone> eddiemonge: nice.. so what u reckon? http://alpha.jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/FHZMd/14/
[12:41:31] <nFFF> muzone, did you see my example?
[12:41:41] <nFFF> your selector was wrong
[12:41:42] <muzone> nFFF: yeah but i didnt understand
[12:41:52] * muzone is now watching: Lilyhammer (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfRgVbp9gSY)
[12:41:59] <nFFF> what didn't you understand
[12:42:05] <muzone> ooh
[12:42:17] <nFFF> Your selector didn't work, if you want to use > (parent > child)
[12:42:25] <muzone> hehe sorry so many people are talking in this channel at once it's hard to keep up :P
[12:42:29] <eddiemonge> muzone: i reckon you need to cleanup your html/css and then start playing with the JS. And you have way too many lists going on, but thats just me
[12:42:52] <nFFF> You where doing parent > child child
[12:43:05] <nFFF> you can't do that, it has to be parent > child
[12:43:10] <muzone> aaaah
[12:43:30] <muzone> thank yall so much
[12:43:31] <nFFF> .foldable li > a
[12:43:36] <nFFF> would work
[12:43:37] <evident> hi everybody!
[12:43:47] <muzone> *gratefuulllll*
[12:43:57] <muzone> anyway gotta watch lilyhammer brb yall
[12:44:46] <evident> can anybody tell me how I can select an element by id that is within an elemnt with another id? Like: <table id="table1"><tr id="tr1">...</tr></table> ... and I would like to selet tr1 if it is in table1...
[12:45:08] <Zerxer> "#table1 #tr1"
[12:45:16] <evident> ahh ok thank yoU!
[12:45:34] <Zerxer> keep in mind that IDs are unique so you shouldn't have multiple elements on the page with the same ID, if you do
[12:45:55] <nFFF> ^^
[12:45:58] <evident> hmm right... I'll think of something else then... thank you
[12:46:30] <eddiemonge> evident: $("#table1").find("#tr1") would be faster than $("#table1 #tr1")
[12:46:49] <Kambfhase> eddiemonge: got a jsperf on that one?
[12:47:02] <eddiemonge> Kambfhase: yeah but dont have a link handy
[12:47:23] <eddiemonge> $("#id") is a super fast selector until you add other stuff in
[12:47:47] <Kambfhase> yeah, but QSA is also kinda fast, where es .find() tends to be rather slow.
[12:48:12] <quizme> how do you call a function after a javascript library has been loaded ?
[12:48:27] <Kambfhase> functionname()
[12:48:43] <Kambfhase> *kidding*
[12:48:52] <evident> ok thank you... I'll try... :)
[12:49:07] <rob_> can anyone tell me why this box isn't resizable: http://dust.cx/~rw/cv/index3.php
[12:49:23] <quizme> is there a way to generate custom events in query ?
[12:49:34] <quizme> jquery
[12:49:42] <johnkpaul> quizme: using trigger() and on() you can use any string you want
[12:49:51] <johnkpaul> or you can use the jQuery.Event objec
[12:50:01] <quizme> johnkpaul thnx
[12:50:05] <chovy> Kambfhase: https://github.com/shichuan/javascript-patterns/blob/master/jquery-patterns/context-and-find.html
[12:50:14] <johnkpaul> rob_: because you're callng resivze before domready
[12:50:22] <rob_> johnkpaul: oh thanks
[12:50:22] <johnkpaul> resize*
[12:50:47] <chovy> Kambfhase: https://github.com/shichuan/javascript-patterns/blob/master/jquery-patterns/decending-from-id.html
[12:51:28] <JonBad> Am I being an idiot? Shouldn't this work? $(document.body).css('mozTransition', 'height 300ms, opacity, 1000ms');
[12:52:18] <Zerxer> shouldn't that be -moz-transition
[12:52:32] <rob_> johnkpaul: it still doesn't seem to work even with document.ready... (refresh!)
[12:52:32] <tw2113> why not $('body') ?
[12:52:47] <Kambfhase> chovy: hm k. I'm gonna dig deeper.
[12:52:51] <chovy> JonBad: does those need ; instead of ,
[12:53:01] <Kambfhase> tw2113: why look for something that you already knwo?
[12:53:02] <eddiemonge> JonBad: what is that supposed to be?
[12:53:18] <chovy> Kambfhase: http://paulirish.com/2009/perf/
[12:53:21] <JonBad> i'm just trying to set the -moz-transition CSS property
[12:53:59] <Zerxer> then put -moz-transition, I don't think mozTransition is going to turn into the other
[12:54:02] <Kambfhase> chovy: 2009 is like 7 internetages ago ;)
[12:54:15] <eddiemonge> JonBad: why cant you set it in CSS?
[12:54:37] <johnkpaul> rob_: do you have the jquery ui css included?
[12:54:38] <JonBad> for the time being, let's just say I can't
[12:55:12] <JonBad> it works for webkit 'webkitTransition'
[12:55:20] <rob_> johnkpaul: oh, no..
[12:55:23] <eddiemonge> Kambfhase: ok so #id #id is a really bad example: http://jsperf.com/id-id-vs-id-find-id
[12:55:42] <rob_> johnkpaul: thanks :)
[12:55:53] <johnkpaul> :) np, hopefully that's the problem
[12:55:55] <rktic> heyo
[12:56:16] <quizme> johnkpaul: Using $.Event, trigger or on(), is there a way to say "as soon as this javascript file is loaded, then call foo()" ?
[12:56:46] <Kambfhase> Fuck, jsperf breaks my browser.
[12:56:51] <victorche> hey, how are you? need someone who can give me 5 mins...
[12:57:06] <victorche> i need some help with jquery and sqlite results..
[12:57:14] <rktic> say - is it possible to use jquery to bend a html elements' content into a css selector?
[12:57:21] <Kambfhase> but yeah, you conviced me, that .find() nis fast after an ID. Thanks you two!
[12:58:01] <eddiemonge> Kambfhase: sorry, check it now. http://jsperf.com/id-id-vs-id-find-id
[12:58:14] <rob_> johnkpaul: it was, nice one thanks :)
[12:58:22] <eddiemonge> for id id, it is faster than id.find id but for anything else, .find is far faster
[12:58:44] <eddiemonge> ?ask @ victorche
[12:58:53] <chrisvwebdev> does anyone know of a tutorial or example of using jquery's validate plugin to test a value in a single input when it looses focus?
[12:59:15] <Kambfhase> ok, the usual fuck up. Things in JS are like this, except when they are not.
[12:59:45] <matjas> Kambfhase which browser? i can look into it for you
[13:00:12] <Kambfhase> every browser.
[13:00:25] <eddiemonge> chrisvwebdev: all of them?
[13:00:39] <eddiemonge> rktic: say what?
[13:01:00] <eddiemonge> victorche: Dont ask to ask, Just ask
[13:01:14] <chrisvwebdev> i'm trying to test an input value when the user's mouse leaves the input text area
[13:01:41] <chrisvwebdev> i don't want to wait for the "submit" click to test values.  is that possible?
[13:01:45] <eddiemonge> chrisvwebdev: thats not losing focus. thats mouseleave
[13:01:54] <rktic> eddiemonge: got a ton of lists which are structured like this: <li>artist - trackname</li> and i wonder if i could use jquery to create a dl around artist and trackname each by using the "-" as divider
[13:02:01] <tuibm> hello all :) can somebody help me to learn? xD i want to use the jQuery ui autocomplete to get the friends list of facebook, but i cant get it work :/
[13:02:17] <anjen> oh! ty eddiemonge I had been wondering about that for some time
[13:02:18] <nFFF> chrisvwebdev, mouseleave is a bad time to do it IMO
[13:02:20] <eddiemonge> rktic: you could but itd be better to do it in the html directly
[13:02:28] <eddiemonge> anjen: about what?
[13:02:41] <anjen> mouseleave
[13:02:48] <nFFF> chrisvwebdev, they could move their mouse during input and youd throw validation error
[13:02:49] <anjen> I'll have to look that one up
[13:02:51] <eddiemonge> chrisvwebdev: you want to validate on .blur() http://api.jquery.com/blur
[13:03:02] <rktic> eddiemonge: i know, but i'm a lazy basterd ;) plus editing those lists in future won't be any easier
[13:03:17] <eddiemonge> anjen: http://api.jquery.com/mouseleave
[13:03:24] <anjen> thanks eddiemonge
[13:03:39] <victorche> eddiemonge: preparing a pastie.org now :)
[13:04:10] <eddiemonge> rktic: doing it in jquery is a lot more work. you need splits and joins and wraps and selectors. too much
[13:04:25] <eddiemonge> rktic: plus doing it html makes it more accessible and semantically correctt
[13:04:27] <chrisvwebdev> eddiemonge: you're right.  then on blur.  i'll use that.  is there a way to validate a single field at a time using the plugin without waiting for the submit event?
[13:04:48] <eddiemonge> victorche: no, not pastie. eww. use jsfiddle.net or jsbin
[13:05:05] <tuibm> hello all :) can somebody help me to learn? xD i want to use the jQuery ui autocomplete to get the friends list of facebook, but i cant get it work :/
[13:05:05] <eddiemonge> chrisvwebdev: look at the docs for it.
[13:05:11] <rktic> eddiemonge: i know, i know. *sigh* - you're right.
[13:05:29] <rktic> eddiemonge: guess i need to find a better way around wordpress to manage playlists then
[13:06:05] <eddiemonge> rktic: im often not wrong :D
[13:06:20] <victorche> eddiemonge: http://pastie.org/3343947
[13:06:26] <eddiemonge> rktic: or make your own wordpress plugin to do it
[13:06:48] <victorche> the problem is... i have a test db, with a single table.. and only 2 lines of data in it
[13:07:02] <eddiemonge> victorche: cache your list length instead of checking .length in every for loop
[13:07:16] <rktic> eddiemonge: well, i just bought a premium theme to get rid of the time for developing stuff on my own ;) plus, i suck at php.
[13:07:38] <victorche> but i want some divs to be populated, depending on the 'type' column
[13:07:41] <eddiemonge> victorche: why do you have a .each in a for?
[13:08:03] <eddiemonge> rktic: hire wesbos or darcyclarke then
[13:08:07] <JonBad> hmm... looks like that must be a jQuery bug
[13:08:12] <victorche> eddiemonge: good question... for is... for every row...
[13:08:22] <eddiemonge> victorche: what does your data look like?
[13:08:37] <victorche> eddiemonge: and each is because i want to populate different divs, depending on the type
[13:08:40] <eddiemonge> JonBad: doubtful
[13:09:24] <nFFF> JonBad, paste the current code you are using
[13:09:31] <victorche> eddiemonge: for example... carId, type, Brand (1, suv, Mazda; 2, coupe, Jaguar)
[13:09:33] <rktic> eddiemonge: ;)
[13:10:04] <victorche> eddiemonge: so I need the rows with type "suv" to go like <li></li> in the div id="suv"
[13:10:09] <eddiemonge> victorche: paste an example at jsfiddle with the data as json so we can see a living example
[13:11:27] <nFFF> victorche, why not use the jquery selector to select the rows then no need for the for loop?
[13:13:39] <victorche> eddiemonge: good, but... can not understand how to implement the stupid db there :/
[13:14:23] <Narinik> is it possible to intercept jquery requests to a php script?
[13:14:26] <quizme> is there a way to generate an event that a library has been loaded?
[13:14:37] <quizme> (a library other than query)
[13:17:07] <rob_> hi can anyone tell me why these boxes 'jump' upwards when i resize either the first or second div?
[13:17:16] <rob_> sorry, url: http://dust.cx/~rw/cv/index3.php
[13:17:39] <victorche> eddiemonge: any other ideas? :/
[13:18:43] <Kambfhase> quizme: load?
[13:18:43] <Narinik> rob_, i think it just might be render lag
[13:19:03] <rob_> Narinik: what is that?
[13:19:07] <quizme> kambfhase thnx just found it
[13:19:41] <nFFF> victorche why can't you use $('#mytable tr').each() ?
[13:19:42] <Narinik> its just the browser catching up in rendering the divs
[13:20:04] <victorche> nFFF: my rows are from a sqlite database... for example 3 rows, with id, type, brand
[13:20:08] <rob_> Narinik: it happens every time i test it, surely that's not right?
[13:20:25] <victorche> nFF: but I want to populate different divs with the data
[13:20:26] <Narinik> does it affect functionality? or do they move perminantly?
[13:20:36] <victorche> nFFF: depending on the type
[13:20:55] <nFFF> victorche, load them to the DOM and then edit them? may be quicker?
[13:21:27] <jeffsmykil> Anyone use bootstrap popovers?
[13:21:30] <victorche> nFFF: well... sounds good but can you give me a hint how to do that?
[13:21:38] <nFFF> Or at least thats the only way I know how :<
[13:21:43] <eddiemonge> victorche: one minute
[13:21:45] <carpediembaby> hi. i have a very simple json response which i am unable to parse with parseJSON. when i see the response in Firebug, it shows json as an object as well as the POST response. but when i use the parse myself in javascript, it fails: http://pastie.org/3344027 can someone please tell me why and what i can do to fix it?
[13:21:47] <nFFF> Kambfhase can probably help
[13:22:12] <victorche> nFFF: I don't need to edit the results... I just need to add the lines in different divs
[13:22:37] <victorche> nFFF: depending on the 'type' (type is a field in my db)
[13:23:08] <Eviltwin> carpediembaby: You can't do multi-line strings that way
[13:23:37] <tuibm> hello all :) can somebody help me to learn? xD i want to use the jQuery ui autocomplete to get the friends list of facebook, but i cant get it work :/
[13:23:41] <victorche> nFFF: the result is an array... with let's say... 3 lines
[13:23:49] <nFFF> victorche, Eviltwin can help
[13:24:04] <nFFF> Im not sure how to manipulate a DB outputs directly
[13:24:23] <carpediembaby> Eviltwin: really? and any idea how to fix it?
[13:24:28] <victorche> nFFF: 1, suv, mazda; 2, coupe, jaguar; 3, suv, honda;
[13:24:49] <Eviltwin> carpediembaby: Throw in \'s before the newlines, remove the newlines, or end the quotes and use concatenation
[13:24:57] <victorche> nFFF: so I want to add all with type 'suv' in div id="suv"....
[13:25:03] <Kambfhase> nFFF: huh?
[13:25:05] <victorche> nFFF: that's all
[13:25:06] <tuibm> im following the sample of this website http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/alon_nativ/archive/2011/05/30/search-facebook-friends-with-jquery-autocomplete.aspx but it dont work on new ui anymore
[13:25:34] <Eviltwin> carpediembaby: Try this http://pastie.org/3344051
[13:26:34] <DerekPioneer> i can't get offset to work inside of a css() . css({'left' : array['value'] + $('.s7Url').offset.left + 'px'})
[13:26:36] <DerekPioneer> that returns nothing
[13:26:42] <victorche> Eviltwin: maybe you can help?
[13:26:46] <DerekPioneer> if i replace $('.s7Url').offset.left     with 300 (for example) it will work
[13:26:53] <carpediembaby> Eviltwin: hmm.. it workd .. so i should try stripping newline characters?
[13:26:54] <DerekPioneer> if i do alert($('.s7Url').offset.left) it will alert the correct amount
[13:26:59] <DerekPioneer> but somehow it doesn't pick it up inside of a css()
[13:27:18] <eddiemonge> victorche: http://jsfiddle.net/wV6jH/
[13:27:20] <Eviltwin> DerekPioneer: Very little about jQuery objects is done properties
[13:27:25] <Eviltwin> Instead it uses methods
[13:27:36] <DerekPioneer> what do you mean?
[13:27:36] <Eviltwin> Which look like .method()
[13:27:40] <DerekPioneer> ok
[13:27:40] <Eviltwin> Instead of .property
[13:27:50] <DerekPioneer> well it doesn't work with offset() either
[13:28:00] <Eviltwin> You sure about that?
[13:28:23] <DerekPioneer> no
[13:28:23] <DerekPioneer> ty
[13:28:27] <eddiemonge> ?offset @ DerekPioneer
[13:28:27] <bot-t> DerekPioneer, .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[13:29:03] <Eviltwin> I'm going to start requiring people to pay me if they tell me my solution won't work before trying it
[13:29:30] <eddiemonge> Eviltwin: id be a billionaire if i did that
[13:30:09] <Kambfhase> ^^
[13:30:15] <thang> "it just doesnt work, i dont know why"
[13:30:54] <quizme> $('body').load(function(){ init(); }); isn't working the same as <body onload='init()' >
[13:30:56] <Kambfhase> "From IRC-Helper to Biollionaire" - The American Dream
[13:31:17] <Kambfhase> ?load @ quizme
[13:31:17] <bot-t> quizme, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[13:31:36] <Kambfhase> be careful .load() also loads stuff.
[13:32:50] <quizme> http://pastebin.com/08w47bnd
[13:32:57] <quizme> kambfhase that's right isn't' it ?
[13:33:04] <Eviltwin> Kambfhase: There are two different .load methods
[13:33:11] <eddiemonge> quizme: depends on when you want init() to do it
[13:33:14] <Kambfhase> yeah.
[13:33:25] <eddiemonge> quizme: when do you want it to fire?
[13:33:26] <Kambfhase> i know, and i guess he is triggering the wrong one
[13:34:01] <quizme> i want it to fire after jit.js loads, which is at the bottom of the page.  <script src='jit.js'></script>
[13:34:15] <eddiemonge> quizme: then thats different
[13:34:42] <eddiemonge> jsut put your code after that
[13:34:59] <quizme> eddiemonge ok
[13:37:30] <muzone> What do people think of the Supersized Slideshow jQuery Plugin? http://buildinternet.com/project/supersized/
[13:38:22] <quizme> eddimonge: it's still not working
[13:38:43] <eddiemonge> quizme: thats not very helpful
[13:38:59] <eddiemonge> what *specifically* is not working and how do you know that its not?
[13:39:22] <quizme> eddiemonge: if i do <body onload='init()'>  the graph loads
[13:39:33] <Eviltwin> muzone: 2 more weeks, eh?
[13:40:11] <quizme> but if i do (function($){ $('body').load(function(){ init(); }); })(jQuery), the graph doesn't load
[13:40:14] <eddiemonge> quizme: still not helpful to troubleshoot your code
[13:40:34] <eddiemonge> either provide a link or a test case at jsfiddle
[13:40:45] <Brodingo> dont use load on the body
[13:40:55] <Brodingo> use it on window
[13:41:00] <quizme> brodingo: ok thnx
[13:41:03] <eddiemonge> also, you dont need the anonymous function
[13:41:07] <eddiemonge> .load(init)
[13:41:55] <victorche> eddiemonge: your code is nice and sweet, but... not working :/
[13:42:42] <quizme> brodingo: $('window').load(….)  didn't load the graph either....
[13:42:58] <muzone> Eviltwin: yup
[13:43:04] <muzone> wait, no
[13:43:10] <muzone> 1
[13:43:40] <victorche> eddiemonge: it is stuck in the first check: if ( typeof obj !== 'object' )
[13:43:40] <eddiemonge> victorche: it was working for me. whats not working on it?
[13:44:06] <victorche> eddiemonge: it is simply returning false, as it enters this very first check
[13:44:16] <eddiemonge> victorche: at http://jsfiddle.net/wV6jH/ ?
[13:44:41] <victorche> eddiemonge: nope, it's working perfect on jsfiddle :/
[13:44:43] <quizme> why isn't $('window').load(…) the same as <body onload='….'> ?
[13:44:53] <victorche> eddiemonge: i am testing it for my case :/
[13:45:08] <eddiemonge> victorche: ok then dont say MY code isnt working when its YOUR code that isnt working ;)
[13:45:28] <eddiemonge> what are you passing in as the argument?
[13:45:33] <victorche> eddiemonge: sorry :) good point
[13:45:35] <eddiemonge> quizme: no quptes
[13:45:45] <eddiemonge> quizme: $(window).load(init);
[13:46:16] <victorche> eddiemonge: i am using it as... function renderCars(tx, results) {
[13:46:34] <victorche> eddiemonge: i guess results is an array :/ maybe?
[13:46:36] <Kambfhase> IRC really needs a flattr option.
[13:46:57] <victorche> eddiemonge: i am more of a php guy... this javascript is really too much for me :)
[13:47:03] <eddiemonge> victorche: arrays are essentially objects in js
[13:47:13] <eddiemonge> victorche: paste whats not working in yours
[13:47:31] <eddiemonge> Kambfhase: flattr?
[13:47:43] <Kambfhase> https://flattr.com/
[13:48:06] <Kambfhase> a micro payment system
[13:48:19] <victorche> eddiemonge: well, I am pasting it in my code, with no errors, but no result also... and when I add alert() in the first check
[13:48:40] <Kambfhase> alert() is not a debugger
[13:49:03] <quizme> eddiemonge thnx that worked.
[13:49:08] <victorche> Kambfhase: I know :) as I said... js is a nightmare for me :) sorry...
[13:49:19] <LekeFly> How do i add .live to this code: jQuery("select").uniform(); ? after a ajax update uniform doesnt work..
[13:50:10] <eddiemonge> victorche: no, i mean paste how you modified the code so i can see it, or provide a live link
[13:50:34] <eddiemonge> ?on @ LekeFly
[13:50:34] <bot-t> LekeFly, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:50:36] <Kambfhase> $.unicorn? never heard of it
[13:50:41] <victorche> eddiemonge: i didn't touch your code...
[13:50:56] <victorche> eddiemonge: it simply does not populate the divs
[13:51:00] <LekeFly> eddiemonge: Thanks, where would that be added? :S
[13:51:01] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: although you should probably call .uniform() in your ajax success callback
[13:51:16] <victorche> eddiemonge: i suppose it is stuck in the first check... in my case
[13:51:19] <LekeFly> Hmm.. okey.
[13:51:36] <eddiemonge> victorche: what is tx and results?
[13:52:01] <victorche> eddiemonge: if i remove the first check, then I get ReferenceError: l is undefined
[13:52:52] <Kambfhase> well, your l is undefined then.
[13:52:55] <eddiemonge> victorche: what is tx and results?
[13:53:12] <eddiemonge> victorche: seeing how you are using the code plus what you are passing in would be really helpful
[13:53:17] <eddiemonge> otherwise we are blind
[13:53:31] <b4ch> Hello everyone
[13:53:32] <victorche> eddiemonge: good question :) this is a stupid phonegap app, let me paste it...
[13:54:12] <Kambfhase> a stupid phonegap app? I am gonna tell that brian!
[13:55:26] <eddiemonge> phonegap sucks
[13:55:38] <eddiemonge> i mean its amazing work that the nitobi team did
[13:55:49] <eddiemonge> but its still a web wrapped app
[13:56:28] <victorche> eddiemonge: http://pastie.org/3344240
[13:56:38] <victorche> the last function is your code...
[13:56:46] <jeffsmykil> how would I continue to go down the dom tree given this: appendTo(inside ? this.$element : document.body)
[13:57:55] <Kambfhase> .find?
[13:58:13] <eddiemonge> victorche: change "results" to obj
[13:58:23] <jeffsmykil> if say the next element is .page
[13:58:39] <Kambfhase> .next('.page') ?
[13:58:56] <eddiemonge> although im not sure what getCars is passing as those results. if its a json representation then you are good
[13:59:15] <kara_sweets> eddimonge, do you have any idea why the success callback in the AJAX function wouldnt work if you just ran this as one file, out of jsfiddle?http://jsfiddle.net/7NUX6/
[13:59:51] <jeffsmykil> oh thanks Kambfhase didnt realize you were talking to me
[14:00:33] <Kambfhase> dont worry about me, i just like talking to my self via irc.
[14:00:38] <Kambfhase> yeah i do.
[14:00:53] <jeffsmykil> you answered so quick
[14:00:57] <jeffsmykil> i got confused
[14:01:06] <muzone> At my side menu at http://alpha.jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/FHZMd/16/ why won't the show/hide JS in the items under "Narrow by" work?
[14:01:19] <muzone> I cleaned it up a little hopefully
[14:01:27] <Kambfhase> they took it from me, my precious.
[14:01:44] <jeffsmykil> darn it that didn't do what i wanted
[14:02:05] <Kambfhase> well you didnt say what you wanted, to begin with.
[14:02:06] <jeffsmykil> trying to get bootstrap popovers to work with a fixed content
[14:02:25] <jeffsmykil> its taking the whole width of the page
[14:02:47] <eddiemonge> kara_sweets: because you cant really post to jsonp
[14:03:23] <Kambfhase> muzone: ".foldable li > a" << you sure this is correct?
[14:03:28] <jeffsmykil> Kambfhase: you aren't a mind reader? geesh
[14:03:33] <Kunda> how does one troubleshoot a jQuery conflict ?
[14:03:40] <eddiemonge> muzone:  i think you want .hide() and show() instead of .addClass(".hide')
[14:03:47] <kara_sweets> hmmm, the callback was working in js fiddle, by callback I mean the alert(data) function.
[14:04:10] <eddiemonge> Kunda: by having jQuery punch what it is having a conflict with in its face
[14:04:33] <Kunda> eddiemonge, how do i initiate that function ?
[14:04:37] <Kambfhase> jeffsmykil: no, mind reading is limited to eye contact, but this is not: http://memedepot.com/uploads/0/234_punch_tcp_ip.jpg
[14:04:44] <eddiemonge> kara_sweets: are you sure you want to be using jsonp?
[14:04:55] <victorche> eddiemonge: now the error is gone, but there is no result... i mean the divs are not populated
[14:05:12] <victorche> eddiemonge: is there a way to check what is "results"?
[14:05:14] <eddiemonge> kara_sweets: take a look at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4508198/how-to-use-type-post-in-jsonp-ajax-call
[14:05:21] <Kambfhase> muzone: event is not defined
[14:05:24] <kara_sweets> pretty sure it;s the only option at this point considering i need to do a cross domain request
[14:05:39] <jeffsmykil> Kambfhase: awesome
[14:05:41] <eddiemonge> victorche: console.log(tx, obj) as the first line in my function then look in your console
[14:05:59] <eddiemonge> kara_sweets: see the link i posted
[14:06:00] <Kambfhase> muzone: this works: http://alpha.jsfiddle.net/FHZMd/17/ your selector was wrong.
[14:06:45] <Raverix> Hello, I have a form submit hanlder, and I've run into an issue....
[14:06:55] <Raverix> The form has two submit buttons, with different values.
[14:06:58] <muzone> Kambfhase: I think that's correct, let me double check
[14:07:15] <victorche> eddiemonge: http://pastie.org/3344240
[14:07:18] <muzone> eddiemonge: I think so yeah. Or do I need both if I want those arrows to change upon show/hide?
[14:07:19] <Raverix> But if I call .submit() on the form, I can't specify which value of the 'submit' buttons should be.
[14:07:26] <victorche> eddiemonge: this is the result in the console
[14:07:33] <muzone> Kambfhase: cool lemme peep dat
[14:08:09] <eddiemonge> victorche: theres something wrong with that. you need to get the results from the query and then pass those in to the function. might want to ask in #phonegap
[14:08:22] <muzone> Kambfhase: you got it.. you got it
[14:08:36] <eddiemonge> Raverix: why do you have a form with two different submit buttons is what you should be asking yourself first
[14:08:55] <Kambfhase> yet another soul saved
[14:09:49] <victorche> eddiemonge: i am following a tutorial and everything works fine... the problem is that i just want to sort the results by 'type'
[14:10:43] <eddiemonge> victorche: the function isnt getting anything useful to use, thats the problem. you arent passing results
[14:11:04] <robert___> ajpiano: you were most helpful. :D
[14:11:12] <ajpiano> :)
[14:11:41] <Raverix> eddiemonge: Because a lot of forms do this, and it's specifically allowed according to the HTML spec. In my particular example, I'm working within the framework of an eCommerce solution which has the following: <input type='submit' name='update' value="Update'/><input type='submit' name='checkout' value="Checkout'/>
[14:12:47] <robert_> so now I have an interesting "dilemma"
[14:13:08] <robert_> I need to look at my javascript tag to see if it contains any javascript
[14:13:12] <robert_> er
[14:13:16] <victorche> eddiemonge: this is the original code, from the tutorial... and it is working fine:
[14:13:19] <victorche> eddiemonge: http://pastie.org/3344240
[14:13:26] <volkman> i have a jquery function that isn't registering. would someone mind taking a look?
[14:13:27] <eddiemonge> ?submit
[14:13:28] <bot-t> .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[14:13:30] <Raverix> robert_: $('script').html()
[14:13:45] <volkman> http://www.bigfoottickets.com/index.php/production/index/1214387
[14:13:51] <robert_> Raverix: this is in my imported html from $.get()
[14:13:51] <volkman> TypeError: $("#venue-map").waypoint is not a function
[14:13:53] <victorche> eddiemonge: it is using 'results' and it is working... i just want to change it to populate the results by 'type'
[14:13:54] <robert_> I need to check <head> for javascript
[14:14:19] <Raverix> eddiemonge: I'm looking at the docs right now, thanks. But I don't see how to specify this value.
[14:14:34] <robert_> Raverix: any idea how I'd do that?
[14:14:34] <eddiemonge> victorche: you lost me
[14:15:01] <Raverix> robert_: Check out the docs, you should have a callback which has the data which was returned.
[14:15:06] <Raverix> this is where you can check anything you need.
[14:15:07] <eddiemonge> Raverix: the form should only submit on one of those button clicks right?
[14:15:14] <Raverix> eddiemonge: That is correct.
[14:15:24] <victorche> eddiemonge: huh... thanks anyway :/
[14:15:33] <robert_> Raverix: I'd be looking at the docs for $.get()?
[14:16:52] <eddiemonge> Raverix: using ajax in the submit or submitting it normally?
[14:17:01] <Raverix> robert_: the success callback has data, textStatus.
[14:17:05] <Raverix> check out both
[14:17:18] <robert_> okay.
[14:17:22] <eddiemonge> robert_: what are you trying to do?
[14:17:49] <robert_> eddiemonge: http://gxysrv01.glenmereind.com/admin.html
[14:17:59] <robert_> click any of the panel icond.
[14:18:05] <Raverix> eddiemonge: $('#myForm').submit(function(e){e.preventDefault();   doAjaxRequest(function(){  submitMyForm();   });});
[14:18:12] <Raverix> That's basically what I'm trying to do.
[14:18:28] <Raverix> I need to prevent the form from being submitted... do some ajax processing... and then submit the form on the callback of my ajax request
[14:19:01] <robert_> basically if the page I've opened with $.get() contains any javascript, it should be run and/or laoded into the browser.
[14:19:04] <zCoder> Hi, I need an expert developer in js/jquery/php/css/html/mysql for 5+ hours daily. Job pays $25+/hr. NDA sig required.
[14:19:27] <eddiemonge> Raverix: i would say add a hidden input and change the value depending on which submit was clicked
[14:19:43] <robert_> zCoder: eww, php.
[14:20:44] <astropirate> Node.js is where its at :)
[14:20:45] <Raverix> the problem with that is that both the name an the value need to change...
[14:20:58] <Raverix> Actually, I guess that's not a problem... assign an id to that, and change the name & value
[14:21:03] <eddiemonge> zCoder: why so low pay?
[14:21:10] <eddiemonge> especially with an NDA?
[14:21:16] <robert_> zCoder: and php.
[14:21:22] <zCoder> I can work with the price a bit
[14:21:26] <robert_> why php? it's an awful language.
[14:21:31] <zCoder> Please everyone who is interested, PM me
[14:21:32] <ajpiano> zCoder: i told you yesterday or two days ago to stop spamming that in here repeatedly.
[14:21:36] <Raverix> zCoder: This is still for the large eCommerce site?
[14:21:45] <zCoder> Yes sir.
[14:21:54] <Raverix> zCoder: You will NOT find a competent coder to do this for your price point.
[14:22:04] <zCoder> and i looked in to Magento.. its to heavy and a insane learning curve
[14:22:05] <Raverix> Anyone who accepts this job, for this price point, won't know what they're doing.
[14:22:18] <astropirate> Raverix++
[14:22:24] <Raverix> zCoder: A custom ecommerce solution, is even further out of the question for your price point.
[14:22:27] <robert_> Raverix++
[14:22:35] <eddiemonge> Raverix: no need to change the name, just the value
[14:22:55] <Raverix> <input type='submit' name='update' value="Update'/><input type='submit' name='checkout' value="Checkout'/>
[14:23:03] <Kunda> Before I installed the responsive slider on the page, the spoilers (collapsable divs) were working. Now they're not working. Is this a jQuery conflict issue? I used jQuery.noConflict(); in my code and it still breaks. Any suggestions? (site: http://tinyurl.com/7z7ydcz)
[14:23:08] <Raverix> Each of the submit buttosn have a different name, and value.
[14:23:14] <B0TTiG> hi everyone
[14:23:25] <eddiemonge> Raverix: you cant use name="formAction" value="which button?"
[14:23:56] <Raverix> No.
[14:24:18] <Raverix> I'm working with Shopify (turnkey eCommerce solution which doesn't allow me any access to the backend... just the front end skinning)
[14:24:55] <B0TTiG> I am using Yahoo Pipes to grab info from Justin.tv API - I need help creating a jQuery to display one of two images based on the parsed data
[14:24:56] <Raverix> I think this will work... <input id='submit_value' name='' value='' /> $('submit_value').attr('name', 'update').val('update');, and same for checkout
[14:25:05] <Raverix> Will test, thanks.
[14:26:02] <victorche> eddiemonge: results isn't an object... it is a resultset
[14:26:43] <B0TTiG> can anyone help? It seems like it should be basic, but I cant get my head around it
[14:28:52] <nFFF> B0TTiG, paste code jsfiddle.net
[14:29:38] <nik_jv> j#jobvite
[14:29:58] <poppiez> how do you hide the scrollbar without scrolling to the top? I tried adding a CSS class with overflow: hidden; while this hides the scrollbar, the page gets scrolled to the top automatically
[14:30:44] <openjoke> ciao !list
[14:31:05] <B0TTiG> nFFF: I dont really have any code to paste, I just dont know where to start with jQuery
[14:31:14] <Cancerus> <div overflow:hidden><div margin-right:-20px></div></div>
[14:31:42] <B0TTiG> I can paste the yahoo pipe if you want...
[14:32:23] <Zzaichik> poppiez:  we're going to need more information. What's causing it to scroll to the top? Page refresh? <a> tag(page refresh)? More info
[14:32:51] <snover> B0TTiG: the first place to start is to learn JS if you donâ€™t know it :)
[14:32:57] <nFFF> but what does 'create a jQuery' mean?
[14:33:00] <poppiez> Zzaichik: well, when the html tag gets added a class with overflow: hidden; firefox scrolls the entire window to the top
[14:33:01] <fission6> if i have a div with text how can i show ore text in it if the user clicks on ... or something? basically i want to limit the text shown then render with more if they click the link
[14:33:17] <nFFF> Im guessing you mean a lightbox to display the images?
[14:33:18] <mattp_> how can i simulate clicking a text box, so i can see the little text type blinking thing
[14:33:28] <Kambfhase> JS stands for jQueryScript, amirite?
[14:33:32] <Cancerus> poppiez look my solution. just move scrollbar to hidden area
[14:33:42] <B0TTiG> I need to create an "If/else" statement that will look at the parsed data and post the appropriate image
[14:34:06] <B0TTiG> several people refered me to use jQuery, but I am not versed in it at all
[14:34:15] <Zzaichik> I'm going back to not paying attnâ€¦  :\
[14:34:17] <poppiez> Cancerus: how would that hide the window scroll bar?
[14:34:20] <nFFF> B0TTiG post your code
[14:34:24] <B0TTiG> ok
[14:34:32] <Cancerus> window? i mean div scrollbar
[14:34:32] <nFFF> upto the point where the data is stored in a variable or object
[14:34:48] <poppiez> Cancerus: I mean the vertical scrollbar in the window
[14:35:02] <Cancerus> you can insert whole page div container _
[14:35:04] <Cancerus> =)
[14:36:28] <Cancerus> just set html and body height:100%, and mage div scrolling. But it works very slow on mobile devices
[14:36:38] <B0TTiG> http://jsfiddle.net/XpcK8/
[14:37:24] <nFFF> B0TTiG ok and you want to do what?
[14:37:43] <poppiez> Cancerus: you would add margin-right: -20px; on the html tag?
[14:38:33] <Cancerus> i dont know about margin-right: âˆ’20px on html tag, i need try it ;)
[14:38:40] <B0TTiG> I have a yahoo pipe that will provide the info "live" or "0"... if the pipe says "live" I need an image to be displayed
[14:38:43] <Cancerus> it is crazy )
[14:39:02] <poppiez> Cancerus: adding a div to the DOM with margin-right: -20px; won't affect the window scrollbar
[14:39:26] <B0TTiG> live = online.... 0 = offline
[14:39:43] <Cancerus> no. margin-right âˆ’20px on html just makes horizontal scrolling
[14:40:37] <B0TTiG> essentially, the pipe is determining if my stream is live
[14:40:47] <Cancerus> poppiez it will affect if that div will positioned absolute, top: 0; bottom: 0; lefft: 0; right: 0
[14:40:48] <B0TTiG> if it is live, i want an image to say "online"
[14:41:29] <B0TTiG> I already am able to get the info from the stream API, but I dont know how to implement it on my site
[14:42:15] <nFFF> I have no idea what yahoo pipe is
[14:42:33] <nFFF> and no idea about it's API
[14:42:35] <rue> It's like a pipe, but yahoo
[14:42:36] <B0TTiG> yahoo pipe parses data
[14:42:41] <Zzaichik> lol
[14:42:55] <B0TTiG> the API is from Justin.tv
[14:43:06] <nFFF> and how does it pass you the data?
[14:43:26] <B0TTiG> I can show you another example I have on the page.. one sex
[14:43:30] <B0TTiG> *sec :D
[14:44:14] <astropirate> :O
[14:44:39] <nFFF> if(yahooPipeData == 'live') { $('.element').append('<img src="liveimage.jpg">'); }
[14:46:21] <Cancerus> poppiez http://jsfiddle.net/GHEda/
[14:47:11] <B0TTiG> http://jsfiddle.net/XpcK8/1/
[14:47:17] <B0TTiG> see the top of the code
[14:48:02] <nFFF> ok so it passes a json object?
[14:48:03] <B0TTiG> the yahoo pipe in this instance is pulling the video code from a youtube feed, the script then puts that into a flash play
[14:48:11] <B0TTiG> yes
[14:48:23] <muzone> EdwardIII: James Edward Gray III?
[14:48:23] <B0TTiG> the API can be json or xml
[14:49:02] <nFFF> Ok... and what does the json contain? what are you looking for within it?
[14:49:07] <muzone> EdwardIII: The Royal Duke himself is it?
[14:50:04] <nFFF> B0TTiG, just check the value you want, and  if(yahooPipeDataObject.state == 'live') { $('.element').append('<img src="liveimage.jpg">'); }
[14:50:22] <b0x> is it OK to use a variable in a selector??
[14:50:54] <b0x> ie: var foo = 'bar'; $('#' + foo).slideDown...
[14:51:01] <Cancerus> ok
[14:51:07] <b0x> or is this incorrect
[14:51:15] <Cancerus> why? it just string
[14:51:21] <nFFF> b0x sure
[14:51:28] <Zzaichik> b0x: pointless but yeah
[14:51:59] <b0x> the value of foo is dynamic
[14:52:09] <b0x> ok
[14:52:17] <b0x> so now, why isnt slidedown working :/
[14:52:28] <Cancerus> what?
[14:53:02] <Zzaichik> slidedown() is looking for more info than that.
[14:53:22] <Zzaichik> or just going slidedown(); I mean
[14:53:36] <nFFF> b0x paste your code jsfiddle.net

[15:04:18] <b0x> wtf
[15:04:22] <b0x> it just started working
[15:04:28] <b0x> was the display:none;

[15:12:29] <initself> Cancerus++
[15:12:47] <TeddyMurray> why isnt show('slide', { direction: 'left' }, 1000); working?
[15:12:50] <TeddyMurray> its saying

[15:14:13] <nFFF> ..

[15:14:43] <nFFF> Yes
[15:14:46] <stas_> hi, I'm trying to use $.ajax to post against a json RPC and receive back some data, could you help me with a link/example or something? I fail at retreiving/parsing response.
[15:14:46] <TeddyMurray> 'slide' ?
[15:14:50] <nFFF> { direction: 'left' }
[15:15:04] <TeddyMurray> that's what it was in the docs
[15:15:30] <TeddyMurray> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Slide
[15:16:49] <TeddyMurray> it was a version error
[15:16:51] <TeddyMurray> fixed it
[15:17:13] <nFFF> What was it ?
[15:17:19] <nFFF> Which version
[15:18:04] <TeddyMurray> not sure, the version number was deleted from the file
[15:18:20] <nFFF> Is it an old jQuery?
[15:18:33] <nFFF> The new documentation says it has to be a string not a object
[15:18:36] <nFFF> So Im perplexed

[15:20:50] <nFFF> tuibm, read the docs on the new plugin
[15:21:03] <astropirate> tuibm: get rid of .result(function (event, item) {alert(item.id); });
[15:21:09] <nFFF> because it doesn't allow result()

[15:29:45] <mindlogger> guys do you know how to search through twitter to get hash tags from an external software?
[15:29:48] <mindlogger> does twitter have a link that returns a json object based on that url query
[15:30:32] <danheberden> https://dev.twitter.com/
[15:32:11] <LekeFly> Anyone that could help me with this js file? its boostrap-dropdown.js .. im trying to use it in magento but since it wont workt with $ i need to use jQuery instead.. http://pastebin.com/LJdpU9vd
[15:35:01] <mindlogger> danheberden: https://stream.twitter.com/1/statuses/filter.json asks for username and password
[15:48:16] <initself> if i add a class after the DOM is loaded, will it apply my stylesheet to it?
[15:48:59] <danheberden> initself you betcha
[15:49:11] <danheberden> which is better practice, more often than not
[15:49:25] <danheberden> to add a class that has your css props in it, instead of putting css props in your javascript
[15:49:42] <danheberden> also lets you take advantage of css transitions 'n stuff
[15:50:05] <astropirate> tuibm: sorry man i got nothign
[15:50:06] <initself> then is my syntax bad?
[15:50:07] <initself> #all_contact_notes td.notes
[15:50:21] <initself> will that not alter the style for just that one cell?
[15:51:18] <danheberden> initself whatever td's have the class notes, ya
[15:53:54] <initself> i can't get it to apply just to that cell
[15:53:59] <initself> frustrating
[15:56:56] <Zzaichik> initself:  yeah you'd have to target that specific td somehow, parent / sibling  with a unique id.. maybe the value or html inside it if that'll stay the same. If you could create a working example on jsfiddle we could be more helpful.
[16:01:58] <tuibm> astropirate: :/ any other way to make autocomplete to work with facebook friend list?
[16:02:20] <astropirate> tuibm: many many ways

[16:02:45] <astropirate> :)
[16:03:08] <astropirate> and sorry I'm a bit busy to really dive into other code
[16:10:12] <eddiemonge> why did i just get pm'ed a jsfiddle?
[16:12:19] <andre_pl> I've got an odd little problem.  I have a ul tag (a few actually) which use overflow-y: auto; to get scrollbars when necessary, problem is the lists scroll themselves to the top whenever any other mouse event happens on the page.
[16:12:21] <SocialEvil> hi guys. i have a question. now i have a .png from photoshop - a simple box . and i want to make accordion effect but i kinda dont get how to make it so, when i click on a row and i got  the effect, the box to expand with the text.. any hints what should i do? get two .png or ? how is it done
[16:17:09] <eddiemonge> andre_pl: sounds like a css problem
[16:17:45] <andre_pl> eddiemonge: any pointers? I've been trying to track it down for a while now. I've got similar setups that work just fine, but this one is giving me trouble.
[16:17:48] <eddiemonge> SocialEvil: like http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/ ?
[16:18:07] <eddiemonge> andre_pl: are the other mouse events clicks on links?
[16:18:46] <andre_pl> eddiemonge: hovering over a suckerfish dropdown menu, dragging a google map, or clicking literally anything.
[16:18:50] <blindMoe> can someone who has IE see if this throws an error for them?  http://jsfiddle.net/YtGKQ/
[16:19:03] <blindMoe> can't figure out why IE is crapping out
[16:19:32] <andre_pl> also strange, if I drag the scrollbar with my mouse, it jumps to the top "onMouseMove", but if I use the wheel, it only happens on clicks and hovers.
[16:19:44] <SocialEvil> eddiemonge kinda like that.. but at the start all of them are "closed" (i think i can make that i guess its somewhere from the options) and the box is not the whole height. but expands with the effect
[16:20:06] <eddiemonge> andre_pl: maybe you are binding something to it
[16:20:31] <andre_pl> i dont have anything that would cause a list to scroll on its own
[16:21:09] <andre_pl> i'm going to try to narrow it down with a small example I can share, if possible.
[16:21:22] <andre_pl> going to be difficult, theres a lot going on on the page.
[16:26:27] <kara_sweets> hey eddie, it looks like the callback function for success in the ajax request isn't returning because of the cross site request policy, do you have any advice for this? http://jsfiddle.net/7NUX6/4/

[17:18:47] <initself> will the width of a table header control the width of a table cell?
[17:19:12] <Eviltwin> PIKE32: You really should never use async:false

[17:20:12] <coldhead> does this work for you heshanh http://jsfiddle.net/Bm4Mg/
[17:20:25] <PIKE32> Eviltwin:i only had it disabled to keep my initial load linear while getting everything in order. now having things async isn't executing the success callbacks

[17:22:27] <Guest98086> hmm
[17:22:28] <PIKE32> still think its something simple
[17:23:00] <PIKE32> i see the request go through fine and return a response
[17:23:16] <andre_pl> eddiemonge: solved: the problem was that the scrollable container was display: box
[17:25:14] <initself> when i look at the source code in firebug for this
[17:25:15] <initself> $('#all_contact_notes').children('tbody:last').append('<tr><td>' + l.id + '</td><td class="notes">' + l.notes + '</td><td>' + l.user_id + '</td><td>' + l.last_update + '</td></tr>');
[17:25:22] <initself> the calls isn't there
[17:25:23] <initself> class
[17:25:34] <initself> any reason why it would omit the class?
[17:25:45] <Guest98086> but ?find doesn't work in my case.
[17:25:54] <Guest98086> At least I'm not sure how it would exactly..
[17:27:07] <initself> do i need do somehow use addClass?
[17:27:18] <heshanh> im adding input text boxes to a form using javascript, theres an add button. onclick it appends the <input... code>
[17:27:21] <Eviltwin> eXodusz: Then you need to learn jQuery
[17:27:24] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ eXodusz
[17:27:24] <bot-t> eXodusz, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[17:27:26] <heshanh> how can i generate Ids for this
[17:28:05] <heshanh> is there a function that gets a timetamp or something
[17:28:19] <eXodusz> Time is money.. ahhh
[17:28:24] <Eviltwin> It should be rare that you ever have to "generate" IDs
[17:28:25] <heshanh> i jut need unique ids, does not haveto be in any format
[17:28:30] <Eviltwin> Especially in JavaScript

[17:29:02] <nathanblogs> and i would like to do somthing like $(tableRows[0] +
[17:29:10] <vicatcu> does anyone have a  recommendation for implementing drag-and-drop UI in JQuery? libraries, tutorials, etc?
[17:29:22] <nathanblogs> and i would like to do somthing like $(tableRows[0] +  " select").val()
[17:30:16] <PIKE32> nathanblogs: id strong reccomend learning backbone.js
[17:30:20] <PIKE32> strongly*
[17:31:02] <PIKE32> well, underscore.js does stuff like that pretty cleanly
[17:31:10] <nathanblogs> :/
[17:31:13] <PIKE32> (backbone is built on top of that)
[17:31:20] <nathanblogs> I only need it for 1 little thing lol
[17:32:14] <nathanblogs> basically loop through table rows and check the selects in each row
[17:32:41] <PIKE32> one sec...
[17:32:59] <initself> I'VE BEEN EDITING THE WRONG SCRIPT
[17:33:01] <initself> initself--
[17:33:23] <PIKE32> using something like each (http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/ ) not working?
[17:33:29] <nathanblogs> ahh
[17:33:35] <nathanblogs> i should be able to use children i think
[17:34:12] <nathanblogs> pike i couldnt think of how to get the select from the tr, bit of a brain fart i guess
[17:34:51] <nathanblogs> $(tableRows[0]).children('select') should work
[17:35:45] <PIKE32> need a period in front of select?
[17:35:50] <PIKE32> if its a class selector
[17:37:17] <PIKE32> and the rows children would be <td>'s i'd think
[17:37:45] <PIKE32> you'd want <tbody> children
[17:38:00] <PIKE32> fyi => http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/
[17:39:08] <nathanblogs> yeah
[17:39:12] <nathanblogs> should be td select
[17:39:16] <nathanblogs> trying to work it out atm
[17:39:32] <Eviltwin> PIKE32: FYI this is #jquery, not #underscore
[17:39:49] <zah_> How would I make an array containing the html of every class '.example'
[17:40:01] <PIKE32> thought he was talking about navigating a collection...
[17:40:05] <Eviltwin> zah_: Why would you want to?
[17:40:20] <Eviltwin> PIKE32: Underscore isn't the only way to do that
[17:40:30] <zah_> so the product would be ['1st_example','2d_example'] etc
[17:40:56] <Eviltwin> $(".example").map(function(){this.innerHTML}).get()
[17:41:07] <PIKE32> ha its code - million ways to skin a cat
[17:41:22] <Eviltwin> PIKE32: I mean jQuery has things like .each and .map etc
[17:41:32] <Eviltwin> And if he's already using jQuery, namely a jQuery collection
[17:41:37] <PIKE32> i reccommended that as well
[17:41:48] <nathanblogs> $(tableRows[i]).children('td').children('select') <- had to do that, would of thought $(tableRows[i]).children('td select') would work :/
[17:42:23] <zah_> Eviltwin: Is this supposed to return an array containing the html?
[17:43:05] <Eviltwin> zah_: It's not supposed to but it does
[17:44:43] <Eviltwin> When you put the return in there

[17:51:20] <karega|aniasis> is there anyway to determine a cross-domain iframe's content window size?
[17:52:50] <initself> i have a function, one for submit and one for document.ready that are basically exactly the same, except for the various JSON paramters I am passing.
[17:52:54] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/67hFx/1/
[17:53:08] <initself> can someone guide me to how I can do this without all the code duplication I have?
[18:01:37] <overthemike> initself: just abstract what you need into a function
[18:05:59] <initself> but it's all wrapped up in the other functions....for the method.
[18:06:07] <initself> i can't see how to do it bceause of that
[18:18:26] <Eviltwin> initself: How about this? http://jsfiddle.net/67hFx/2/
[18:19:26] <initself> incredible!
[18:19:36] <initself> Eviltwin++ # i totally see the light!  holy crap!
[18:19:57] <Eviltwin> I'm utterly confused as to how you didn't see how you could tidy up at least some of that before
[18:21:00] <Eviltwin> Like making the success a separate named function
[18:26:57] <initself> i just didnt understand what the output of the function would be
[18:27:05] <initself> i'm really bad extrapolating from jquery
[18:27:13] <initself> i still have syntax error somewhere tho
[18:27:14] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/67hFx/3/
[18:27:24] <initself> i called mine contact_notes instead of go
[18:27:33] <initself> missing ) after argument list ?

[18:29:54] <LukeNukem> i have e.preventDefault(); but the page reloads..
[18:29:58] <Eviltwin> I thought by now you'd know the policy about pasting code here
[18:30:26] <LukeNukem> Eviltwin, sorry, but do you know why the page keeps reloading
[18:30:48] <Eviltwin> Because e is undefined
[18:31:03] <LukeNukem> e is the function's name?
[18:31:20] <ajpiano> is this deja vu

[18:34:19] <nathanblogs> would .removeClass('valid,invalid,duplicate') work ?
[18:34:20] <snover> i just need to add more !!!!!s?
[18:34:32] <Eviltwin> Yes, and if you could just send the question 3 times in a row
[18:34:35] <Eviltwin> That way we see it
[18:34:46] <Eviltwin> nathanblogs: api.jquery.com/removeClass
[18:35:01] <Eviltwin> nathanblogs: It's described how to remove multiple classes
[18:35:48] <nathanblogs> ty
[18:35:58] <nathanblogs> as always should read the docs
[18:38:50] <LukeNukem> ok im learning on code academy

[20:10:02] <nijo> it is not working in any of my browsers
[20:10:10] <coldhead> perhaps you are not loading jQuery?
[20:10:18] <coldhead> or you are loading garbage instead of jQuery?
[20:10:50] <panzi> ngharo: about $(document).ready(): for some reason it won't fire for me when the do is already loaded
[20:11:07] <panzi> can't reproduce this in jsfiddle :(
[20:11:08] <nijo> and also a internal file
[20:11:08] <nijo> i am doing this to load jquery
[20:11:10] <nijo> no
[20:11:11] <nijo> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
[20:11:37] <ngharo> if you're just starting jquery, dont use an out of date version
[20:12:06] <nijo> k
[20:12:31] <nijo> i downloaded the minified version from jquery.org
[20:12:49] <coldhead> try taking your javascript out of a php file where it doesn't belong and where dreamweaver might be ruining everything. put it in helloworld.js and load that as a <script src="helloworld.js"></script
[20:13:04] <panzi> hmm, it seems only to happen when I run my script as chrome app
[20:15:02] <coldhead> take hold cause I'm near the loose one

[20:15:26] <coldhead> if i had ops i would kick myself
[20:16:15] <ngharo> lol
[20:17:45] <nijo> could a tab space cause an error
[20:17:52] <nijo> i cleared the spaces between and i got it to work
[20:18:08] <ngharo> haha
[20:18:12] <ngharo> what a weirdo that guy
[20:18:59] <ngharo> nijo: tabs and spaces shouldnt have any effect
[20:20:08] <panzi> nijo: maybe you somehow got a special unicode space (like non-breakable space) into the source? that happened to me once with a java source.
[20:20:17] <panzi> almost drove me insane
[20:20:33] <panzi> the compiler complained about a line where there only was white space!
[20:21:36] <panzi> if you copy-pasted the example from a webpage that used &nbsp; for the whitespaces this could be an explanation
[20:21:54] <nijo> yeah could be that...
[20:22:02] <nijo> anyways need another help
[20:22:18] <meelu> i want to fetch data from a json file once if ""status" : "ok",", but if ""status" : "unfinished"," reload the data every 5 seconds, can anyone point me to the right direction please?
[20:22:33] <nijo> i doing a work...
[20:22:38] <nijo> i have a php code that loads almost 20 check boxes
[20:23:32] <nijo> i want to get the value of all the checked  checkboxes
[20:24:17] <methoddk> I was coding something earlier and I had an issue with a variable being undefined, and it would stop a for loop because of it
[20:24:22] <methoddk> is that a jQuery issue?
[20:24:34] <panzi> look at $.ajax (or $.get or $.getJSON) and $.delay
[20:24:46] <methoddk> thats what i was using
[20:25:09] <methoddk> but i was setting a variable for a link, and if that variable was null or undefined on a for loop it stopped
[20:25:27] <methoddk> i was matching a link with regexp and then if it had a link, replacing it with html
[20:25:35] <panzi> methoddk: are you sure you declared the var in the right scope?
[20:25:39] <methoddk> yes
[20:25:45] <panzi> then I don't know
[20:25:48] <methoddk> it was a twitter API call
[20:26:15] <LekeFly> How do i reapply this jQuery(function(){ jQuery("select").uniform(); }); after a ajax update?
[20:26:25] <methoddk> and if the tweet didn't contain a link, than tweet[i].entities.urls[0].url would be undefined. and error out
[20:26:28] <methoddk> then just stop
[20:27:07] <ngharo> you could have used hasOwnProperty see ?mdn hasOwnProperty
[20:27:11] <bot-t> ngharo, #10639 (outerWidth(true) and css('margin') returning % instead of px ... - Opened 3 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10639
[20:27:12] <panzi> methoddk: have you stepped through it with the debugger?
[20:27:17] <methoddk> i ended up just doing an if/else to match the regexp in the string, then replacing, since it would never try to look at an undefined variable, but usually you can check for falsy
[20:27:19] <ngharo> argh
[20:27:31] <methoddk> panzi: yeah, it was always that variable being undefined
[20:27:50] <methoddk> so if it wasn't undefined, the code ran
[20:27:54] <methoddk> if it was, it stopped
[20:28:59] <methoddk> i got it to work by coming at it from an easier ( and much shorter code length) way
[20:29:17] <methoddk> just wondering if jQuery has an issue with falsy variables
[20:29:54] <panzi> methoddk: whats the problem again? when the var is undefined your code throws an exception? then check if the var is undefined and act accordingly. or what exactly would error out?
[20:30:20] <methoddk> i was checking for the var to be undefined
[20:30:32] <methoddk> but if it WAS undefined, it wouldn't check and throw an exception
[20:30:54] <panzi> where would the exception be thrown? at the check?
[20:31:07] <methoddk> on the variable
[20:31:40] <methoddk> ex: var randVar = tweet.url.from.api;
[20:31:48] <methoddk> if that turned up undefined, it stopped
[20:31:53] <methoddk> no matter what
[20:33:31] <panzi_> damn my ISP
[20:33:52] <methoddk> it was throwing on the variable set
[20:33:54] <panzi_> what was the last msg you saw?
[20:34:00] <methoddk> ex: var randVar = tweet.url.from.api;
[20:34:04] <methoddk> panzi: where would the exception be thrown? at the check?
[20:34:05] <methoddk> that
[20:34:15] <panzi_> ok, so resend:
[20:34:17] <panzi_> are you sure that "tweet[i].entities.urls[0].url" would be undefined, or would "tweet[i].entities.urls[0]" be undefined?
[20:34:21] <panzi_> if the latter it would of course throw if your check is: if (tweet[i].entities.urls[0].url)
[20:34:33] <methoddk> ohhh
[20:34:35] <methoddk> makes sense
[20:34:44] <methoddk> i was so flustered i didn't think of that
[20:34:45] <LekeFly> How do i reapply this jQuery(function(){ jQuery("select").uniform(); }); after a ajax update?
[20:35:01] <methoddk> i changed my approach and saved a lot of code, so it worked out better
[20:35:23] <methoddk> but why would it throw? its still undefined
[20:35:58] <panzi_> I wonder why $(document).ready() is not working for me when I call it after the doc is loaded and the script is run as a installed chrome app
[20:36:28] <panzi_> I have to work around it by "if (document.body) f(); else $(f);"
[20:39:05] <indraveni> hello all , finally i got my json code working with redirection
[20:39:19] <indraveni> all the values are also moved across the two php scripts perfectly
[20:39:24] <indraveni> but i have a small problem now
[20:39:46] <indraveni> i am reading a test data from a file using a json data
[20:40:09] <indraveni> jason.encode("logdata" => $line)
[20:40:25] <indraveni> how should I load this value in my div block
[20:40:44] <indraveni> I am using,  $('#load_process').load("data.logdata").fadeIn("slow");
[20:40:51] <indraveni> but its not loading the data value
[20:40:58] <indraveni> into the div block
[20:41:07] <indraveni> should I do some kind of parsing ??
[20:43:06] <methoddk> jason.encode?
[20:43:54] <indraveni> sorry its json_encode*
[20:44:23] <methoddk> okay just making sure lol. paste the code in jsfiddle?
[20:44:39] <indraveni> in wireshark, I am able to see that logdata="tesxt content" is reaching my index page, but its not displayed in the div block
[20:44:45] <panzi_> I don't know, maybe jQuery does not like to load something into a div that hasn't a content type of text/html?
[20:44:46] <indraveni> ok jst a moment
[20:45:50] <indraveni> my code is pasted here, http://pastebin.com/XkKmewXH
[20:46:38] <panzi_> use .text instead of .load
[20:46:47] <methoddk> why not use current jQuery?
[20:47:37] <panzi_> load makes a ajax call to the url provided as argument: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[20:47:48] <indraveni> I don't see fadeIn in current jquery
[20:48:13] <panzi_> indraveni: I see it
[20:48:33] <ngharo> ?fadein
[20:48:33] <bot-t> .fadeIn([duration], [callback]): Display the matched elements by fading them to opaque. http://api.jquery.com/fadeIn/
[20:48:55] <indraveni> I changed to .text,
[20:48:59] <indraveni> still its not showing the content
[20:49:45] <panzi_> step through it with the debugger. see if $('#load_process') works and if data.logdata has the right value
[20:49:50] <indraveni> is this the latest version which you are mentioning about http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.1.min.js panzi_
[20:49:58] <methoddk> yes
[20:50:15] <methoddk> data.logdata should that have the function name in front?
[20:50:18] <panzi_> and test on the console: $('#load_process').text("test")
[20:50:38] <indraveni> data.logdata is getting the right value, ( its actually getting 3 lines from a file )
[20:50:53] <methoddk> & you know for sure its setting it right?
[20:51:22] <panzi_> check in the elements panel of firebug/chrome inspector if the value is loaded into the dom.
[20:51:40] <panzi_> if yes, maybe there is some stylesheed that hides the parent element?
[20:53:21] <indraveni> .text("test") is not loading
[20:53:45] <methoddk> try append?
[20:53:56] <methoddk> .append("<p>test</p>
[20:53:58] <methoddk> ")
[20:55:37] <jermiggin> hello. i need to transform the whole body in 3 dimensions, however i need it to have a parent for the perspective property to apply. is there a simple way to move the whole body into a div and then put that back in the body?
[20:55:56] <angelazou> hi, I'm a jQuery newbie, wrote a quick snippet for calculating the discount level
[20:56:10] <angelazou> but the value didn't come up at all
[20:56:16] <coldhead> ?wrap @ jermiggin
[20:56:16] <bot-t> jermiggin, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[20:56:17] <angelazou> see paste http://jsfiddle.net/nbquw/1/
[21:01:53] <angelazou> I thought it was because the number was an object
[21:02:07] <angelazou> so I modified the script to use parseFloat instead
[21:02:18] <angelazou> However, I still couldn't get it to run
[21:02:23] <indraveni> I tried else{$('#load_process').text("Welcome"); }
[21:02:26] <indraveni> but its not working
[21:02:30] <angelazou> here is the updated script http://jsfiddle.net/nbquw/2/
[21:02:30] <jermiggin> coldhead: hmm, that seems to be okay accept for it seems the div is white obstructing the body background
[21:02:36] <indraveni> nothing is shown in browser
[21:02:38] <indraveni> div block
[21:02:41] <coldhead> jermiggin: http://jsfiddle.net/R2adX/ that works for me
[21:03:42] <jermiggin> coldhead: ah okay i was trying wrap()
[21:04:00] <coldhead> so was i but this is more elegant
[21:04:00] <jermiggin> "body > *" will clone all children?
[21:04:26] <coldhead> it does what you want
[21:04:27] <coldhead> yes
[21:10:45] <kara_sweets> hey guys, im sending a cross site ajax request and want to fake the response callback with a div that appears on click and indicates a successful post, how would i add that to this? http://jsfiddle.net/7NUX6/6/
[21:25:01] <danibx> I have a css animation that I want to use with click events. I thought of an easy way to try to acomplish this. Find all elements that have a click event attached and than add another click handler that will add the animation css class. Is there a way to find all elements with a click event attached?
[21:33:11] <indraveni> in my show.php, there is a while loop with which the json_encode is sending more than one time to index.php
[21:33:57] <indraveni> removing the while loop and when tried to send only one line then its sending the content to index.php
[21:34:57] <coldhead> that all working out for you jermiggin ?
[21:35:24] <coldhead> ?p @ indraveni
[21:35:25] <bot-t> indraveni, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:35:31] <jermiggin> coldhead: having a little trouble preserving the background. maybe i just don't understand html / css well enough
[21:35:52] <jermiggin> for example i'm on the jquery home page with the console open
[21:36:34] <jermiggin> if i copy all of body's children to a div, insert that back into body.html(), the background image isn't part of the new div, it's still part of the body. even if i removeClass() on body
[21:37:12] <jermiggin> stepping back, in a nutshell i want to move the whole page on a plane in 3d space
[21:37:26] <indraveni> here is my code, http://pastebin.com/M7guJRuy
[21:37:49] <indraveni> I should return the array from show.php to json data and show that array content in the div block
[21:38:28] <jermiggin> all i'm after here is a way to contain the whole page in a parent so i can apply perspective, so that it renders as close to the same way it does in 2d
[21:38:49] <coldhead> jermiggin: the background remains because it's attached to "body" in the CSS
[21:38:58] <coldhead> so as long as you have a body element it will have that background
[21:39:08] <coldhead> what might work better for you is an iframe
[21:39:18] <coldhead> then you can load the entire page into the iframe and mess with it as needed
[21:39:24] <coldhead> perspective wise
[21:39:27] <jermiggin> ah
[21:39:29] <coldhead> without having to futz with the css
[21:39:38] <indraveni> coldhead: are you able to check my code
[21:39:41] <coldhead> iframes are little bitches
[21:39:50] <coldhead> so i'm not sure how the rotation will work
[21:39:50] <jermiggin> any performance hit with that? it's cached anyways right?
[21:39:51] <coldhead> but good luck
[21:40:07] <coldhead> the main performance hit will be to your motivation when it doesn't work
[21:40:10] <coldhead> but maybe it will!
[21:40:11] <coldhead> <3
[21:40:57] <jermiggin> so basically reload the whole page into an iframe in itself and then remove everything else from the dom
[21:43:03] <jermiggin> well actually that might not work because there still has to be a body to have an iframe right?
[21:43:22] <jermiggin> this is for a chrome extension so i can get around some of the annoying things
[21:43:28] <coldhead> jermiggin: i was thinking more load the page you want to rotate into an iframe and rotate the iframe
[21:43:41] <coldhead> indraveni: http://pastebin.com/HsnUfB8W
[21:43:46] <coldhead> i don't know what's wrong with your code
[21:43:54] <jermiggin> well the thing is i want to do it on a given page
[21:43:55] <coldhead> but i changed the way you pass the data
[21:44:06] <coldhead> it's better not to build the query string yourself if you can avoid it
[21:44:15] <jermiggin> and it'd be awesome to preserve the state of the page when the extension goes into effect
[21:44:34] <indraveni> coldhead: the logdata value is nto visible in my div block in case of success
[21:44:37] <coldhead> jermiggin: so on a given page, when activated, replace the page with an new page that loads the old page in an iframe
[21:44:40] <indraveni> since the $line is an array,
[21:45:16] <indraveni> in wireshark I see the the values passed as.......... {"isDone":false,"logdata":["Information Gathering Scan Started for ...192.168.53.57..<br\/> \n","Port and OS scan started for ..192.168.53.57..<br\/> \n",null]}
[21:45:51] <jermiggin> coldhead: i mean it'd be awesome to have the dom in the same state and text remain in input boxes and stuff. unless you can pass a whole dom tree to an iframe which i bet you can because it's jquery
[21:45:59] <indraveni> you can see that logdata is holding an array structure, but I think I am not showing the array correctly, at else{$('#load_process').text(data.logdata); }

[21:46:40] <kara_sweets> hey guys. how would you add a div on the completion of this ajax request that says "complete" or something similar?
[21:46:46] <coldhead> damn you, bot-t, i wanted the other each
[21:47:18] <coldhead> i think you're trying to have your cake and eat it too, jermiggin
[21:47:45] <coldhead> what i understand of what you want can only be done with an iframe
[21:47:50] <coldhead> i understand your caveats
[21:47:58] <coldhead> but they're too gomblicated for me
[21:48:20] <coldhead> jermiggin: i would maybe take this to forum.jquery.com for a slower, better answer
[21:48:30] <coldhead> or ask here when the great people of north america are more awake
[21:49:06] <coldhead> kara_sweets: use the success: parameter of the ajax() function
[21:49:13] <coldhead> ?ajax @ kara_sweets
[21:49:13] <bot-t> kara_sweets, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[21:49:22] <jermiggin> okay, i'll try the forum thanks a lot for helping
[21:49:32] <kara_sweets> for some reason when i use the success param, I cant get it to actually do anything :(
[21:50:42] <coldhead> kara_sweets: then jQuery does not realise success has occured?
[21:50:57] <coldhead> that can happen if the server doesn't return anything
[21:50:59] <kara_sweets> it appears so, could it be that im passing the wrong datatype?
[21:51:31] <kara_sweets> hmm, so if i didnt want to actually return anything, BUT did want to indicate that something was returned, i could just return an arbitrary text string?
[21:51:57] <coldhead> that would probably satisfy jQuery
[21:55:09] <coldhead> kara_sweets: jquery also cares about the http status the server returns
[21:55:22] <coldhead> a 404 or whatever makes jQuery think it's failed
[22:01:04] <coldhead> i wish i thought it would end
[22:01:31] <jermiggin> maybe i can set perspective on the whole document?
[22:01:46] <jermiggin> you can't set css on the document can you? :\
[22:02:37] <coldhead> html is the topmost CSS element
[22:03:18] <coldhead> but i just tried zoom: 0.5 on that
[22:03:21] <coldhead> and it shrinks the content
[22:03:29] <coldhead> the background still extends 100%
[22:03:47] <coldhead> i expect 3d transforms would have the same dealio
[22:03:51] <indraveni> I am getting syntax error message in this code, http://pastebin.com/HFhvpq9P
[22:03:57] <indraveni> missing });
[22:04:14] <jermiggin> oh well thanks
[22:04:19] <coldhead> jermiggin: what if your plugin had the iframe around all pages at all times anyway
[22:04:19] <indraveni> but I am unable to figure where the missing brace it,  could someone please help me in resolving this missing brace
[22:04:29] <kara_sweets> hey coldhead, because it doesnt actually matter if it displays the data of the form after the request, how would i just append a div that says "success" to the form, on form submit
[22:04:30] <kara_sweets> ?
[22:04:34] <coldhead> even if they're not using the transofrm stuff
[22:04:42] <coldhead> then it would be ready to go when needed?
[22:05:23] <coldhead> $('form').append('<div>Success</div>');
[22:05:28] <coldhead> immediately after the ajax call
[22:06:25] <jermiggin> you mean it just hooks into the pageload callback or whatever chrome does and load the page in an iframe every time?
[22:06:37] <coldhead> yah
[22:06:42] <jermiggin> hmm good idea
[22:06:47] <coldhead> the user wouldn't even know
[22:06:58] <coldhead> and you don't have to worry about the page state when you started messing with it
[22:07:58] <indraveni> coldhead: I altered the code given by you a bit, becuase it was syntax error
[22:08:09] <indraveni> after altering, its giving a brace missing error
[22:08:13] <coldhead> i'm sorry indraveni
[22:08:17] <indraveni> could you please help me in  this
[22:08:17] <coldhead> i did my best
[22:09:49] <kara_sweets> coldhead, thanks, however now the success div just stays there even after i nav away and come back, is there a way to append the div, saying success and then redirect? to another page?
[22:10:02] <kara_sweets> or just have it disapper at a certain point?

[22:37:52] <pcgenius> hello
[22:38:11] <pcgenius> i have a problem in using jquery booklet lugin
[22:38:15] <pcgenius> *plugin
[22:38:43] <mindis|wurk> sounds like you're not living up to your name
[22:38:59] <mindis|wurk> ironically, neither am i!
[22:39:05] <pcgenius> i just want to select specific
[22:39:08] <pcgenius> div
[22:39:16] <pcgenius> for the booklet page
[22:40:03] <pcgenius> i posted my complete issue
[22:40:07] <pcgenius> here http://goo.gl/dG4F9
[22:40:21] <pcgenius> that's why i am not re-writing it here
[22:40:31] <pcgenius> so please help me solving this issue
[22:40:57] <pcgenius> @mindis|wurk:nice one
[22:40:59] <nathanblogs> $('col').parent().append('<col width="50">'); , would this be the correct way to add another col, or would this break in some browsers ?
[22:43:32] <nathanblogs> i guess something like $('col').last().after() would be better ?
[22:44:18] <mindis|wurk> sounds like the same thing
[22:44:45] <nathanblogs> yeah but what if <col> isn't in <colgroup>
[22:44:50] <nathanblogs> and instead is part of the table
[22:44:57] <nathanblogs> wouldnt it append it to the end of the table
[22:45:15] <pcgenius> minidis|wurk:can you help in my issue?
[22:45:26] <nomad111> I'm writing a plugin that converts a div and its children into a picture gallery
[22:45:43] <nomad111> it will transform the child locations and other css properties
[22:46:19] <nomad111> what approach can i use to retain the state of the dom elements so that i can destroy the widget later on
[22:46:21] <nomad111> ?
[22:47:35] <mindis|wurk> nathanblogs true, though i've never used cols so i assumed they have to be inside colgroups
[22:48:19] <mindis|wurk> pcgenius sorry, i have no experience with that plugin. i only use jquery and jqueryui =)
[22:48:43] <pcgenius> minidis|wurk,oh anyways thanks
[22:49:21] <pcgenius> i am searching for the solutin since last 24 hrs but still nothing i got
[22:49:29] <pcgenius> *solution
[22:56:52] <pcgenius> ok so any other person here who can help me in solving my issue
[23:07:05] <SlexAxton> pcgenius: i'd suggest some sort of pc genius!
[23:08:30] <SlexAxton> pcgenius: instead of .children('div.mypages') try .find('div.mypages')
[23:10:02] <pcgenius> SlexAxton:i did that
[23:10:17] <pcgenius> SlexAxton:yesterday i tried it but the problem comes after it
[23:11:00] <pcgenius> SlexAxton:is first of all you can't close your book and the second one is that once you flip complete book you can't flip back to the previous pages
[23:11:12] <pcgenius> SlexAxton:until unless you reload the page
[23:12:34] <SlexAxton> sounds like you need some logic to make it only do that when you want it to
[23:12:41] <pcgenius> yes
[23:12:52] <SlexAxton> so if you can detect if you're on the last page
[23:12:57] <SlexAxton> or you want to go back
[23:13:01] <SlexAxton> then use .children()
[23:13:04] <SlexAxton> otherwiser
[23:13:10] <SlexAxton> -r
[23:13:16] <SlexAxton> use .find(
[23:13:26] <SlexAxton> but writing that logic is up to you
[23:13:57] <pcgenius> yes you are correct i will try to do that
[23:14:05] <pcgenius> or i can say i am trying that already
[23:14:39] <pcgenius> what i did is i just replace src.children() with src.find('div#myPages')
[23:14:57] <pcgenius> in plugin javascript(jQuery) file
[23:16:11] <pcgenius> then it will start workign but now the new problem comes as i explained above
[23:16:54] <justinhjohnson> #myPages denotes an id, of which you can/should have only one
[23:16:55] <fourfivefire> hello guys
[23:17:17] <fourfivefire> i have a problem and i hope someone here can help me please..
[23:18:53] <pcgenius> justinhjohnson:ya you are correct that's why i tried it with class also
[23:19:03] <fourfivefire> I have a row of table, which I need to duplicate under the last row in the table and change id-X to last id+1
[23:19:05] <pcgenius> justinhjohnson:but still the same issue cimes
[23:19:08] <pcgenius> *comes
[23:21:07] <SlexAxton> fourfivefire: starting with any code?
[23:21:45] <fourfivefire> SlexAxton: i simplified the example, but the actual code is here http://pastebin.com/pyU9tyNJ
[23:24:59] <fourfivefire> SlexAxton: i am open to any other solution, i need to process the page with php and have different name for every item..
[23:26:40] <SlexAxton> function clonetobottom(id){ var $this = $('tr#id-'+id), $tbody = $this.closest('tbody'); $tbody.append( $this.clone(true).attr('id', "id-" +$tbody.find('tr').length ) );   }
[23:26:44] <SlexAxton> something like that fourfivefire
[23:29:26] <fourfivefire> SlexAxton: i am not sure, what exactly to do with it. I tried to read the code and understand it, but i am not able.. can you help me please? :)
[23:30:00] <fourfivefire> like "when clicked link #clone, run function clonebottom(id)"?
[23:30:31] <SlexAxton> read through the code
[23:30:36] <SlexAxton> the first thing it does
[23:30:45] <SlexAxton> is get a tr element with an id
[23:30:59] <SlexAxton> you can change that to match how you name your tr elements
[23:31:08] <SlexAxton> then it finds the tbody element
[23:31:17] <SlexAxton> which is the direct wrapper of the table rows
[23:31:31] <SlexAxton> then it calls append
[23:31:39] <SlexAxton> on the tbody
[23:31:44] <SlexAxton> which adds an element to the end
[23:31:51] <SlexAxton> and the element that it adds
[23:31:59] <SlexAxton> is the original tr element
[23:32:03] <SlexAxton> cloned
[23:32:12] <SlexAxton> clone(true) means 'with events'
[23:32:16] <SlexAxton> you may not need that
[23:32:31] <SlexAxton> and then it changes the id to something new
[23:32:50] <SlexAxton> the new thing is the current amount of tr elements inside of the tbody
[23:33:02] <SlexAxton> (which would assume that you were zero indexing
[23:33:45] <fourfivefire> SlexAxton: thanks a lot! i am going to fiddle around with it
[23:34:47] <Xotix> how can i affect what gets pasted? Some browsers support a paste event, but i don't get itâ€¦How can i clean it up and return it, so my cleaned up text gets pasted?
[23:35:21] <SlexAxton> changing people's clipboard is a security risk that most browsers prevent
[23:35:25] <SlexAxton> and when they do allow it
[23:35:32] <SlexAxton> it's unreliable and not recommended
[23:35:42] <Xotix> I'm not changing their clipboard
[23:35:54] <SlexAxton> oh
[23:35:55] <SlexAxton> i see
[23:36:03] <SlexAxton> just after they've done a paste _into_ your page
[23:36:11] <SlexAxton> i guess you could just listen for the change event
[23:36:14] <SlexAxton> on the form element
[23:36:22] <SlexAxton> but that doesn't happen until blur
[23:36:25] <SlexAxton> in most places
[23:36:27] <Xotix> Yes, i can receive their pasted stuff, add even some text, but not actualyl change the existing stuff.
[23:37:26] <Xotix> I got a editable div. Is there something like checking if the input was made with the keyboard?
[23:38:23] <SlexAxton> you could capture the key events
[23:38:26] <SlexAxton> and not cancel them
[23:38:30] <SlexAxton> for ctrl+v
[23:38:36] <SlexAxton> but there's still right click and paste
[23:38:40] <SlexAxton> from the menu
[23:38:49] <SlexAxton> and you can't capture that event
[23:38:53] <SlexAxton> you can poll for changes
[23:39:32] <Xotix> yes o course, crtl v i'll create my own pasting. But because of the menu stuff i'd liek to check if new input != keypoardKey then doâ€¦. Or something like that

[23:54:16] <nathanblogs> is there an easy way to reove a column from a table
[23:54:51] <SlexAxton> reove?
[23:55:05] <SlexAxton> remove
[23:55:38] <SlexAxton> that's a little trickier
[23:55:52] <SlexAxton> assuming there's no thead for now
[23:55:57] <SlexAxton> you could do
[23:56:37] <nathanblogs> how do you get a whole column tho ?
[23:56:44] <nathanblogs> you can just give it the td and it will do all of them ?
[23:57:19] <SlexAxton> $('#mytable tr').each(function(){ $(this).find('td').eq( COLUMN_NUM ).remove(); });
[23:57:39] <pmcnabb> I'm including stickyfloat (http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/stickyfloat) and applying it to a selector in $(document).ready(). I'd like it to run when the page loads in addition to the standard behavior of on scroll events. This is so that when visiting a page with an anchor in the url, the floating box would scroll down. Any thoughts?
[23:58:15] <SlexAxton> $('#mytable tr, #mytable thhead').each(function(){ $(this).find('td').eq( COLUMN_NUM ).remove(); });
[23:58:19] <SlexAxton> if you have a thead
[23:58:19] <nathanblogs> thatll work :D
