[05:51:54] <Duvdevan> are there any serbs here?
[06:15:16] <P0rk> by the way, MikeD_, I ran my page through an accessibility test and had NO PROBLEMS. with the strictest requirements for accessibility.
[06:17:31] <P0rk> And did I mention this is for driving tests. If blind folks need to be able to have access to these forms, they have bigger issues than  a simulated radio buttons to address first--like being unable to drive, for example.
[06:25:37] <x-finite> i am submitting an aweber form but wish to save session variables right before the form is submitted
[06:26:53] <SirLagz> I have a script, that has a $() nested in a $(). The parent $() works, but the nested one doesn't. Why would that be ?
[06:54:28] <kneekoo> hello
[06:54:57] <kneekoo> getJSON play tricks with me for some reason
[06:55:22] <kneekoo> it works if I run the code in the console, but it doesn't work the same in a function
[06:56:25] <kneekoo> I just getJSON and within the same function I output the response in the console and that works, but then myjson.responseText is undefined
[06:56:39] <kneekoo> it doesn't make sense
[06:58:00] <P0rk> sirLagz, if you could post your html and js to jsfiddle.net, it's a lot easier to troubleshoot
[06:59:13] <P0rk> kneekoo, it's because it's asynchronous...
[07:00:35] <P0rk> if you entered your getJSON in the console, and (without executing it) immediately tried to address something inside of the repsonse text, then press enter, you will get the same response in the console
[07:01:36] <kneekoo> P0rk: thanks for the tip :)
[07:18:08] <SirLagz> P0rk: problem is the page I'm trying to build is a page within a WordPress installation.
[07:18:26] <SirLagz> P0rk: so there's probably a billion other things that's affecting what I'm trying to do
[07:28:13] <P0rk> SirLagz, and with the code in your possession, you can't figure it out, but expect us to figure it out with no code...lol that;s rough.
[07:28:47] <P0rk> there are folks on here that can do it though.
[07:29:20] <SirLagz> P0rk: i'm looking for any tips at all
[07:29:26] <SirLagz> throw me anything
[07:29:35] <SirLagz> or in case someone has done what I'm doing before lol
[07:31:46] <SirLagz> P0rk: what confuses me, is that the parent $() works, so obviously jQuery is being loaded
[07:32:15] <SirLagz> why would a secondary one not work if the primary one works =/
[08:01:12] <Mark__> can anyone tell me how i can emulate this? http://www.cyworld.com/cyevent/fullmh/main.asp#minihp
[09:44:13] <blinky_> Could someone please tell me why the branchGet in this script is not being passed to the PHP file. - http://pastebin.com/kHSFDxD6
[10:36:29] <KamalKaur> Greetings!
[10:37:36] <KamalKaur> I'm working to validate my input fields. I need to validate a field in which only numbers from 1-31 are allowed. Here's my working code: http://jsbin.com/bubaxekumu/1/edit?html,js,output
[10:37:57] <KamalKaur> It doesn't seem to be proper. How can it be improved to validate what I want?
[10:50:17] <P0rk> are you using html5?
[10:51:34] <KamalKaur> P0rk: Are you talking to me?
[10:55:39] <paulvd> if (jQuery('#members-list').is(':empty')) { will be true it <div id="members-list"> </div> ??
[10:55:44] <paulvd> if*
[11:06:30] <P0rk> kamalKauri, there are a number of ways to do what you want. But checking for the change event may not be the best way. I would capture each key on key down and make sure its valid before adding it to the end of the value. Then preventDefault() makes it so they can't enter the wrong number.
[11:07:14] <P0rk> paulvd, the '.empty' class is something you assigned or someone else did. Not jquery.
[11:07:27] <P0rk> or is that a :
[11:07:43] <P0rk> damned second rate irc client.
[11:07:45] <paulvd> P0rk
[11:07:49] <paulvd> its :
[11:07:50] <paulvd> not class
[11:08:24] <P0rk> sorry, I'm using Trillian and the text is impossible some times...
[11:08:55] <P0rk> so if you have a div with nothing in it, it's empty, right?
[11:09:12] <paulvd> yeah
[11:09:19] <paulvd> but when i do .lenth check
[11:09:24] <paulvd> length*
[11:09:25] <paulvd> it shows 1
[11:09:45] <P0rk> lol
[11:09:56] <P0rk> that's because you counted how many empty elements there were
[11:09:57] <P0rk> 1
[11:10:16] <P0rk> not how many elements inside of the .members-list
[11:10:28] <P0rk> .children().length would give you 0
[11:11:17] <P0rk> if you had two empty divs then  $(":empty").length==2
[11:11:40] <paulvd> hm
[11:11:44] <paulvd> ok
[11:11:45] <paulvd> thanks
[11:12:30] <P0rk> wait....is() returns a true or false value
[11:12:58] <P0rk> $(".something").is(".something")  doesn't have a length it has a true or false (1 or 0)
[11:15:00] <P0rk> $("#members-list") .length  with be 0 if the element can't be found. It will be 1 if it can because an ID can only be assigned to one element.
[11:55:54] <KaurKamal> What's the proper way to add validations to my input fields with Jquery? I tried this: http://jsbin.com/bubaxekumu/1/edit?html,js,output
[12:16:48] <doug64k> KaurKamal: declare your variables. where's 'var' for value variable
[12:17:20] <KaurKamal> doug64k: That's fine, I'll modify my code but what about the validations?
[12:18:40] <doug64k> KaurKamal: you might want to set focus to the problem input, if the submit came from a button press
[12:19:22] <jeffreylevesque> what's the best way to include another javascript into an existing script?
[12:19:29] <doug64k> KaurKamal: leading spaces cause failure
[12:19:49] <doug64k> jeffreylevesque: use an amd library, like requirejs
[12:19:51] <KaurKamal> doug64k: In actual my data is being submitted on input change but here I used only alerts so I used onchange event and just added a button
[12:21:43] <jeffreylevesque> i want to load a javascript in my 'beforesend' in my ajax
[12:21:51] <jeffreylevesque> instead of writing the entire js in the 'beforesend'
[12:22:13] <KaurKamal> doug64k: Is that the correct way to validate data?
[12:22:46] <doug64k> KaurKamal: yes it's ok. I wouldn't repeat selectors so much. $('#days') shouldn't occur over and over in that function
[12:23:14] <KaurKamal> Then what will yo udo instead?
[12:23:18] <KaurKamal> you do*
[12:23:41] <doug64k> var days = $('#days')    then replace all those $('#days') with days
[12:24:16] <KaurKamal> With a difference of 1 character?
[12:24:44] <doug64k> DRY
[12:25:00] <KaurKamal> Days are also repeated then? o.O
[12:25:20] <doug64k> days isn't a function call is it
[12:25:41] <doug64k> anyway...
[12:26:02] <doug64k> you should make it more data driven. the inputs that can't be blank should be able to share one validation handler
[12:26:20] <KaurKamal> that 's what I'm asking :D
[12:26:22] <KaurKamal> How?
[12:26:29] <doug64k> $('#days') could be $(this)
[12:26:41] <doug64k> then the changehandler could validate any number of that same kind of input
[12:27:06] <doug64k> not very useful for that case, but useful for "can't be blank" validation on several fields
[12:27:23] <KaurKamal> doug64k: Didn't get you :s
[12:28:55] <doug64k> $('#fname, #lname, #etc').on('input', function(event) { var elem = $(this), val = elem.val(); elem.toggleClass('invalid', val.length==0); })
[12:29:12] <doug64k> one handler can make sure any number of fields are not zero length
[12:29:34] <KaurKamal> oh
[12:30:00] <KaurKamal> Got you
[12:30:25] <KaurKamal> But I've a form displayed with for loop and I've variable IDs, in actual
[12:31:04] <doug64k> can you collect an array of elements in that loop, and then wrap a jquery around it?
[12:32:08] <doug64k> I guess I have to see code to suggest that specifically
[12:32:34] <KaurKamal> Actually only one input field will be changed at a time and I've specified different classes for columns and variable ID's to rows
[12:33:19] <doug64k> KaurKamal: how many that change at one time isn't important. the important thing is not copy/paste coding a bunch of almost duplicate validation functions
[12:33:58] <KaurKamal> okay.. Let me show you my form
[12:37:42] <doug64k> what I would do is have an  object with a property name per validator (validateNotBlank, validateDigitsOnly, validateEmail) then on the inpts I would add a data-validate="validateNoBlank" for example. then in code I can do $('[data-validate]') to get every input that needs validation, and lookup the validator function in the object, and invoke it
[12:39:36] <KaurKamal> doug64k: This is my form: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/74ce8ddb7eccb9be21db
[12:40:48] <mooncup> jeffreylevesque: create a function and call it?
[12:49:48] <doug64k> KaurKamal: I would do it more like this http://www.jstraight.com/1143/1
[12:50:17] <doug64k> then you simply add an attribute to the inputs and there is no extra code when you add inputs
[12:50:35] <doug64k> and it is reusable - not hardcoded for this page
[12:51:13] <KaurKamal> right
[12:51:31] <KaurKamal> doug64k: And to validate anything we just need to change the regex, right?
[12:51:56] <doug64k> add another property to validators and make a function for any different things
[12:52:14] <KaurKamal> okay
[12:52:20] <doug64k> updated it to return true from validate() if everything was ok http://www.jstraight.com/1143/2
[12:53:35] <doug64k> then just use the same name in the data-validate attribute as what you put in the validators object, and it will lookup the right validator function
[12:59:08] <doug64k> KaurKamal: you can scope the validate function too, to do only descendents of a given node...
[13:00:28] <doug64k> KaurKamal: http://www.jstraight.com/1143/3
[13:01:16] <KaurKamal> okay, many thanks :)
[13:01:24] <doug64k> np
[13:23:37] <victorzki> hi! how can i inherit the css properties of the anchor? (<a>)
[13:23:52] <victorzki> i want to put the same properties in a custom attribute
[13:24:47] <doug64k> victorzki: I think the only way is through some raw js function like GetComputedStyle
[13:25:31] <doug64k> victorzki: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/window.getComputedStyle
[13:25:58] <victorzki> Great, I'll give that one a shot. Thanks man
[13:27:13] <doug64k> if it doesn't get you ALL the way there it should at least get you very near perfect. I an not sure if it will show the browser's base styles, but I think it will.
[13:28:11] <doug64k> if necessary, make a few properties of anchors be explicit but match the expected appearance (assuming it is the default appearance)
[13:28:28] <doug64k> then getComputedStyle should definitely tell you those
[13:29:58] <BillCriswell> You can get multiple css properties with an array using .css and apply them with .css as well.
[13:30:41] <doug64k> BillCriswell: I think he wants to copy the appearance of anchors to something else. .css wont do that at all
[13:31:29] <doug64k> victorzki: hey wait, what do you mean "custom attribute". did you mean element?
[13:32:23] <victorzki> nevermind, I realised that that is completely irrelevant when i sent that message hehe
[13:32:44] <doug64k> so you do want to detect all the style properties of anchors, right?
[13:32:46] <BillCriswell> doug64k: I was thinking they wanted something like var props = $a.css(['color', 'backgroundColor', 'width']); $b.css(props);
[13:32:56] <doug64k> so you can make something look just like an anchor?
[13:33:03] <doug64k> ah
[13:33:38] <victorzki> ok, so I want to create something like <a something="abc"> that is clickable and inherits the css properties of an <a href="">
[13:33:56] <doug64k> victorzki: that is not legal html
[13:34:06] <doug64k> what is "something"
[13:34:46] <doug64k> <a href="..." data-something="abc">foo</a>    <-- that is legal though
[13:35:05] <tharkun> doug64k: I discovered the autocompletion plugin. I need to chain the output of one to another. Do you know what is my search term?
[13:35:08] <victorzki> I'm creating a routing provider, in learning purposes, like angular and it to work like angulars <a ng-href>
[13:36:04] <doug64k> tharkun: you need to provide a "source" that is a function on the second one, so it can take the first one's value into consideration (if I understand you)
[13:37:28] <tharkun> doug64k: Yes you do understand me. Will look into it as soon as I get home.
[13:37:29] <doug64k> tharkun: that function can just provide autocompletes that are available for that second input, with the value of the first input filtering what the second one could be. am I following?
[13:38:25] <doug64k> tharkun: the place where simplistic examples would provide an array like ['apple', 'orange'] in a demo, there you *usually* can provide a function object, and it will call you to "ask you" for values
[13:38:57] <tharkun> Yes, you are following fine. I can use the first autocompletion as a filter directed to the Model and only json back the apropiate data to the widget in question.
[13:39:45] <doug64k> victorzki: oh ok. that's easy then. what angular does is check for a few different attribute prefixes, in decreasing priority
[13:40:35] <doug64k> victorzki: you can use invalid attribute names and you can read them now, that's why ng-href works. however, it is not valid html and you *should* be a good web developer citizen and have mercy on future people adding attribute names.
[13:40:53] <doug64k> they allocated the whole data- namespace to people for them to use. html will never add an attribute name that begins with data-
[13:41:20] <BillCriswell> data-ng-whatever works with angular as well.
[13:41:22] <doug64k> data-ng-href works
[13:41:34] <victorzki> ah ok I see :)
[13:41:37] <victorzki> thanks
[13:48:21] <doug64k> victorzki: if you feed non-standard-style angular with ng-href to this ( http://validator.w3.org/ ) it will complain, but data-ng-angular will be completely valid. that's the main reason to use (and/or allow for) data- prefixes
[13:49:14] <OOPMan1> Hey all
[13:49:38] <victorzki> doug64k: all right :)
[13:50:16] <OOPMan1> Has anyone had experience with jQuery.data being, um, "laggy" with returning data?
[13:51:34] <OOPMan1> I have some code (http://pastebin.com/EBTwaX3u) which is using MochaJS to run Unit.JS tests on my code
[13:52:08] <doug64k> OOPMan1: no, jquery uses an optimization for it actually
[13:52:36] <OOPMan1> I'm getting this rather odd behaviour where retrieving the data attribute of an element doesn't return the data until a point well after it should...
[13:52:44] <OOPMan1> If you look at that pastebin
[13:52:44] <doug64k> OOPMan1: it has to read one attribute from the element, the read one property on an object
[13:53:18] <OOPMan1> doug64k: Okay. Can I describe what's happening on my code and maybe you can explain why?
[13:53:29] <doug64k> sure
[13:54:01] <OOPMan1> doug64k: If you look at my paste, you'll see that I have a selection nonUnique on which I run my plugin
[13:54:20] <OOPMan1> doug64k: The plugin gets instantiate and stored on each element in the selection using jQuery.data
[13:54:34] <OOPMan1> doug64k: Everything works perfectly except for one oddity
[13:55:01] <OOPMan1> doug64k: On lines 19 through 22 you'll see I retrieve the first item from the selection and the item after it
[13:55:22] <OOPMan1> doug64k: I try to obtain the plugin instance objects using a .data call
[13:55:42] <OOPMan1> doug64k: Except for some reason it doesn't actually work and firstInstance ends up being undefined
[13:56:20] <OOPMan1> doug64k: The weird thing is, if I move the var firstInstance from line 20 to line 33
[13:56:25] <OOPMan1> doug64k: It suddenly works...
[13:56:53] <OOPMan1> doug64k: I know MochaJS can run tests Async but I'm pretty sure I'm not doing so...
[13:57:33] <doug64k> .grandChildOfTestPlugin is in $.fn ?
[13:57:39] <OOPMan1> Yes
[13:58:03] <OOPMan1> It's a test for a jquery plugin creation framework I'm working on
[13:58:07] <OOPMan1> That provides inheritance...
[13:58:10] <OOPMan1> And some other stuff
[13:58:18] <doug64k> this is why you don't share state across multiple tests
[13:58:35] <OOPMan1> doug64k: :-)
[13:58:47] <doug64k> but what you are doing seems reasonable
[13:59:05] <OOPMan1> doug64k: I thought so too, despite sharing state...
[13:59:14] <OOPMan1> doug64k: It's just kinda odd. I don't mind tweaking my test
[13:59:20] <doug64k> hey, why not hook $.fn.data for debugging, and trace out all the sets and gets
[13:59:30] <OOPMan1> doug64k: Part of me is wondering if this is because I'm running my test inside a Node.JS env
[14:05:59] <doug64k> OOPMan1: you could plug this in before the test setup and trace the gets and sets http://www.jstraight.com/1144/1
[14:06:14] <doug64k> and/or put a breakpoint there and look around
[14:07:33] <stangeland> How can i get every n'th element from an array?
[14:08:12] <doug64k> myarray[i * 4]   <-- gets every 4th element starting at 0
[14:08:19] <doug64k> myarray[i * 4 + 2]   <-- gets every 4th element starting at 2
[14:08:42] <doug64k> 0, 4, 8, etc    vs    2, 6, 10
[14:09:00] <stangeland> doug64k, so in a loop i guess?
[14:09:12] <doug64k> stangeland: be more specific about what you mean by "get"
[14:09:12] <stangeland> anyway to avoid the loop?
[14:09:49] <stangeland> doug64k, just extract every n'th element. I have array A, and i want to put every n'th element into a new array N
[14:09:50] <stangeland> B
[14:10:05] <stangeland> not N, but B
[14:10:54] <doug64k> function every4th() { var result=[]; input.forEach(function(v, i) { if (i % 4 == 0) result.push(v); }); return result; }
[14:12:03] <doug64k> function everyNth(input, n) { var result=[]; input.forEach(function(v, i) { if (i % n == 0) result.push(v); }); return result; }
[14:12:27] <doug64k> but I would use a for loop
[14:12:39] <doug64k> no wasted iterations then
[14:16:23] <doug64k> dangerousdave: no tele?
[14:16:36] <dangerousdave> no
[14:18:20] <doug64k> I'm extending this thing to have the complete unicode name database and cross reference http://www.jstraight.com/1116/94
[14:18:58] <doug64k> any ideas how to load a 1MB+ ajax without lagging the UI? :D
[14:26:16] <Xatenev> Why would u load 1mb+ ajax?
[14:26:24] <Xatenev> sounds like something you should do on pageload..
[14:28:57] <doug64k> it does - and I realized the lag. it isn't the ajax, it is the parsing of 1MB of text all at once. I will stagger it out with a deadline to process it in the background
[14:55:28] <Blaster> Can you find elements by their x/y coordinates on the page?
[14:58:01] <nathaneltitane> how can i set an element to hide if div is equal or lesser than 1?
[14:58:23] <Xatenev> Blaster: sure u can
[14:58:27] <doug64k> nathaneltitane: how can a div be less than one
[14:58:29] <Xatenev> document.elementFromPoint(x,y)
[14:58:30] <nathaneltitane> see fiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/bEdfX/677/
[14:58:38] <Blaster> Xatenev, thanks.
[14:58:50] <nathaneltitane> div.container (as a class i mean) doug64k
[14:59:30] <nathaneltitane> i'd like for the .load-more not to show if there is only one div.container displayed on pageload
[14:59:41] <nathaneltitane> p.s.: i am not a JS JQ eiz :(
[14:59:45] <nathaneltitane> wiz*
[15:01:57] <doug64k> nathaneltitane: $('.load-more').toggle($('div.container').length==1)
[15:03:33] <doug64k> means, hide .load-more if there are not exactly 1 div.container
[15:03:55] <doug64k> means, show .load-more if there is exactly 1 div.container
[15:04:12] <codecutter> is there a method to moving the position of element from one place to another or is it better off to append the element and remove the old?
[15:04:25] <nathaneltitane> doug64k: doesnt seem to do it on the fiddle :(
[15:04:36] <doug64k> codecutter: appending it somewhere else automatically removes it from old
[15:04:52] <doug64k> codecutter: to prevent that, you need to .clone() it
[15:05:10] <codecutter> really?
[15:05:13] <doug64k> yes
[15:05:15] <Xatenev> codecutter: keywords: insertBefore insertAfter prependTo appendTo
[15:05:15] <Xatenev> :)
[15:05:23] <codecutter> ok, cool.
[15:05:48] <nathaneltitane> doug64k: http://jsfiddle.net/bEdfX/678/
[15:12:03] <doug64k> nathaneltitane: http://jsfiddle.net/bEdfX/679/   works as expected
[15:12:18] <doug64k> $('div.container').length=1 right?
[15:14:14] <nathaneltitane> doug64k: not when 2 or more
[15:14:15] <doug64k> nathaneltitane: come up with a boolean expression that is true when you want the .load-more to show, and pass the result of evaluating that expression to the .toggle call
[15:14:53] <doug64k> .toggle( ... expression that is true when you want it to show... )
[15:15:42] <doug64k> it will just do it once on page load
[15:15:47] <doug64k> you need to refresh it?
[15:16:02] <doug64k> update it*
[15:18:09] <nathaneltitane> doug64k: doesn't for me oddly :/ http://jsfiddle.net/bEdfX/682/
[15:18:54] <doug64k> doesn't what?
[15:19:12] <doug64k> you want it to hide if it IS one?
[15:19:26] <nathaneltitane> doesnt execute on refresh and run, the .load-more stays there
[15:19:59] <doug64k> does this fix it http://jsfiddle.net/bEdfX/683/
[15:21:06] <nathaneltitane> doug64k: indeed :) thank you
[15:29:38] <ThomasCrown> has anyone used the script 'tagit' before?
[15:31:23] <doug64k> ThomasCrown: this? https://github.com/aehlke/tag-it/blob/master/README.markdown
[15:32:32] <ThomasCrown> yes
[15:32:43] <ThomasCrown> doug64k: yes
[15:33:01] <doug64k> I can probably help. what's the issue?
[15:34:07] <ThomasCrown> I was checking to see if anyone has an easy way to insert each tag into a mysql database after it is created. I basically need to figure out where to put the addtag.php script and the deletetag.php script file to be triggered.
[15:35:28] <doug64k> ThomasCrown: ok, what if they write a typo and you create it then they back up and start fixing it?
[15:36:05] <Xatenev> Anybody of u guys using atom
[15:36:05] <Xatenev> ?
[15:36:09] <Xatenev> the IDE ?
[15:42:53] <codecutter> foo.insertAfter('.boo') will take the foo element and place it after boo, correct?
[15:42:58] <codecutter> or is the other way round?
[15:43:04] <codecutter> is it*
[15:43:38] <codecutter> not working for some reason.
[15:43:40] <codecutter> hmm
[15:45:58] <codecutter> I have bunch of li's elements, trying to insert an element after the 'li' element that was clicked, but seems not to be working (insert is not working) var liElem = $(event.target).closest'li.msg');this.select('rep').insertAfter(liElem);
[15:46:31] <codecutter> not sure if that made any sense.
[15:46:37] <codecutter> tired.
[15:52:11] <sherafff> hi, in a <video> tag, i'm deleting a <track> and adding a new one just after than, how can i fire a function when the new track src is loaded ?
[15:57:24] <sherafff> $("#el").load(function() { ok(); });
[15:57:27] <sherafff> ok.
[16:06:47] <ThomasCrown> doug64k, I am not sure what you mean
[16:19:48] <Paradisee> is it possible to make buttons like this: http://dpaste.com/1G49ZCK ??
[16:22:28] <P0rk> can option elements have class attributes and how would you determine the current selected option in a select element;   ?? $("option[value='"+sel..val()+"'])
[17:14:44] <CorySimmons> Why does document.querySelector work in this context, but $('.foo') does not? http://codepen.io/corysimmons/pen/fixKG
[17:17:42] <Paradisee_> $('path')
[17:17:53] <shoky> CorySimmons: it works, but it returns it wrapped in a jquery collection. add [0] to get the first result, e.g.  $('path')[0]
[17:18:38] <CorySimmons> Oh yeahhh
[17:19:18] <Paradisee_> is there a way to avoid the br? http://dpaste.com/28S8C90
[17:20:09] <shoky> put both buttons in a block element e.g. <div>
[17:20:24] <shoky> that's really an html/css question tho
[17:20:29] <Paradisee_> ya, i know..
[17:22:24] <CorySimmons> shoky: Same CodePen, new question. Why isn't line.attr('stroke-dashoffset', 10); offsetting that line?
[17:24:29] <CorySimmons> Hmm, doesn't seem to work even in the html itself.
[17:24:36] <CorySimmons> I'll take this over to #html
[17:25:17] <CorySimmons> Oh derp, it's because it's not a dash
[17:25:21] <CorySimmons> It's just the stroke
[17:29:58] <Streemo> hey guys so i have a an input tag, which is a file upload type. how can i access the file contents from jQ? is there something like $(#fileuploadtag).fileData
[17:31:01] <BillCriswell> Streemo: You can use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader
[17:31:38] <BillCriswell> If you need old browser support you would have to upload it via ajax or something.
[17:36:16] <Streemo> thanks bill
[17:40:51] <BillCriswell> Streemo: No problem.
[17:54:34] <stangeland> Given a string like this: 'translate(-215.9516143798828,21)scale(2.4387097358703613,2.4387097358703613) ' how do i extract the value 2.4387097358703613?
[18:24:33] <sherafff> stangeland: split it
[20:24:33] <bnovc> I would like to execute some code when the callbacks for numerous $.ajax calls are complete (rather than when the server returns)
[20:24:51] <bnovc> it seems ilke using $.when(ajax call list) calls before the .done() callbacks complete on the $.ajax object
[20:25:07] <bnovc> is the right way to handle this to create $.Deferred objects for each call and then use .resolve() on them in the callback?
[20:29:55] <bnovc> nvm
[20:33:21] <Jamesonwa> bnovc
[21:33:34] <TeddyMurray> anyone here familiar with form-validator?
[21:35:16] <TeddyMurray> im getting: Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function (index):35(anonymous function)
[21:35:32] <TeddyMurray> on $.validate();
[21:40:51] <TeddyMurray> figured it out
[22:25:24] <Streemo> is there any way to target a "on checkbox select"
[22:25:52] <Streemo> 'click input[name='selectAll']' ?
[22:27:52] <Streemo> ya it works
[22:29:02] <Mark__> anybody still alive?
[22:29:09] <Mark__> is there anybody out there?
[22:29:11] <Mark__> hello
[22:31:31] <TeddyMurray> hi Mark__
[22:31:59] <Mark__> do you know why this isn’t working ?
[22:32:04] <Mark__> this is the original js : http://luke.sno.wden.co.uk/full-screen-vertical-scroll#fsvs-initial-setup
[22:32:16] <Mark__> and this is me trying to emulate it : http://jsfiddle.net/929aprov/
[22:47:41] * CssNoob good afternoon y'all
[23:44:47] <stangeland> Hi, if i do 'translate(-215.9516143798828,21)scale(2.4387097358703613,2.4387097358703613) '.match('scale\((.*)\)') i get 3 hits? How do i make an expression which gets the first scale parameter?
[23:51:47] <Woet> stangeland: how is it related to jQuery again?
[23:52:55] <stangeland> Woet, im using jquery for the regex
[23:53:10] <Woet> .match isn't jQuery.
[23:53:27] <stangeland> Woet, so you cannot use .match in jquery?
[23:53:38] <Woet> did I say that?
[23:54:09] <Woet> you can use plain javascript fine while using jQuery.
[23:58:53] <stangeland> Woet, ok, but why do i get 3 hits?
[23:59:07] <Woet> stangeland: why are you asking in #jquery?
[23:59:48] <stangeland> why not
[23:59:56] <sacho> stangeland, you asked in #javascript also, where deltab provided you with an answer
