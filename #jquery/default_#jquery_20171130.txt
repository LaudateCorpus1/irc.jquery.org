[02:16:13] <MelvinJ> So I am using a MVC structure, using index.php as a controller. Every link sends data back to index.php and depending on the post data, I include the proper page. Can I do this using ajax?
[02:59:51] <Cork> MelvinJ: do what?
[03:00:47] <Cork> MelvinJ: ajax is usually used for what is often called partial updates, so you fetch a new part of the page and replaces something that contains that part
[03:01:10] <Cork> MelvinJ: you can't replace the entire page (headers isn't valid in a ajax response)
[03:01:16] <MelvinJ> post data to index.php on click(): in index.php I use $_POST['page'] == 'userprofile' from a hidden for
[03:01:17] <MelvinJ> form
[03:01:22] <Cork> or anything outside body actually
[03:01:51] <Cork> MelvinJ: ajax requests isn't any different to normal http requests except they don't expect a full page response
[03:02:26] <MelvinJ> Oh ok. So I use ajax for a search form, and it totally makes sense because it updates my drop down box with the names it searches from the db
[03:03:13] <Cork> MelvinJ: a better option is prob to do something like an autocomplete and have the server respond with a json array with the results
[03:04:07] <MelvinJ> Yeah the server does respond with a json array, and it retrieves it
[03:04:13] <MelvinJ> I use $.get for that
[03:04:25] <MelvinJ> if I am understanding heh
[03:04:40] <MelvinJ> Have an example of something like an autocomplete?
[03:04:44] <Cork> MelvinJ: i would recommend having a look at http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[03:07:07] <MelvinJ> Awesome, thanks!
[03:30:56] <mrpickle> hi, I want to show divs depends on time. I have used momentjs --> https://momentjs.com/ ..... which is exacly what I wanna do, but its easy to hack by change my computer time. How can go for a "LIVE CLOCK" ?
[03:48:46] <Cork> mrpickle: you can't
[03:49:10] <Cork> javascript runs locally on the visitors computer, the time the computer sees is the time it lives in
[03:49:57] <Cork> mrpickle: the only option you have is to make an ajax call to the server and check the time offset, but don't forget you have network latency so that time will be variably old
[03:49:58] <mrpickle> ok, so there is no library that can handle that?
[03:50:11] <Cork> library can't get info that doesn't exist
[03:50:15] <mrpickle> can It be done with php or someelse code?
[03:50:23] <Cork> you need a third party if you want to verify local time
[03:50:40] <mrpickle> Cork: do you have anything to recommend?
[03:50:45] <Cork> mrpickle: sure, but you will have to compensate for network response and request times
[03:51:04] <Cork> mrpickle: if this is security related you shouldn't do it in javascript
[03:51:14] <Cork> include it dependent on server time
[03:51:24] <Cork> and have the server give the data if it thinks it is time else not
[03:51:37] <Cork> then you can completely ignore what local time the user has
[03:51:51] <mrpickle> I use firebase if that maybe can handle it ?
[03:52:01] <Cork> if it is just for show then moment and the users clock should be enough
[03:52:16] <Cork> mrpickle: client side can't ever handle it
[03:52:25] <mrpickle> its not a security thing, but it would be better if its not that easy to hack
[03:52:31] <Cork> and there isn't ready made things as far as i know for server side handling either
[03:52:33] <Cork> you will have to code
[03:52:58] <Cork> mrpickle: there is really only two options, control everything server side and have the client just make ex. an ajax call
[03:53:08] <Cork> or let it be what ever it is based on client time
[03:53:39] <mrpickle> Cork, ok thx for info, will see what I can do
[04:47:28] <stripes> Hello im trying to append data into form dynamically but its not included in the post
[04:47:35] <stripes> not even in serialise
[04:58:09] <FilipNortic> stripes: what do you mean data? are you setting value for inputs
[04:59:18] <ExeciN> hey people, I'm using this https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3100870ed361e318252a88086bb6b19b to scroll to the element specified when clicked
[04:59:25] <ExeciN> the code works when pasted to the browser console but it doesn't work when I include it in my page
[05:00:18] <FilipNortic> are you sure a.v_menu_trigger exists when the code runs
[05:00:35] <ExeciN> FilipNortic: ah good call
[05:01:13] <ExeciN> that element already has some events bound to it, is there a way to find out the code for it?
[05:01:39] <MaxFrames> hello
[05:02:23] <FilipNortic> ExeciN: just put console.log($( "a.v_menu_trigger"))
[05:02:27] <FilipNortic> before
[05:03:28] <MaxFrames> I have a jquery/ajax web page with an html table; at loading time each table cell gets a value from a mysql backend, and an html custom attribute ("oldVal") with the same value
[05:03:59] <MaxFrames> the attribute is then used in javascript to detect if the user has changed the value of the cell (if so, the ajax part kicks in)
[05:04:01] <stripes> FilipNortic: im just appending inputs to the form
[05:04:16] <stripes> like i have one ticket and im adding more with append
[05:04:46] <MaxFrames> the issue I need to solve is that, after the cell has been updated and the new value saved to the mysql backend, I need to set the "oldVal" html attribute of the cell to the current value
[05:05:04] <FilipNortic> stripes: what does these inputs look like?
[05:05:15] <MaxFrames> I've tried this syntax: $(this).attr('oldVal',data['val']);
[05:05:33] <MaxFrames> where data['val'] is the new value
[05:06:25] <stripes> FilipNortic: standart <input type="text" name="ticket_name[]">
[05:06:34] <MaxFrames> there seems to be no syntax error, but I am not getting the expected result (which is, if I change the value back to the previous value it should detect a change, but it doesn't, which seems to imply that the "oldVal" attr has not been set to the new value
[05:07:05] <MaxFrames> please let me know if I need to clarify better
[05:07:09] <FilipNortic> MaxFrames: when using custum attr use data instead it's oftern better. so change old val to data-oldVal
[05:08:24] <FilipNortic> MaxFrames: also try console.log(data['val']) before you use it and see if it is what you'd expect
[05:10:27] <MaxFrames> ok, data['val'] is the expected value, which is good
[05:10:53] <MaxFrames> can you please edit my syntax as per your instruction?
[05:10:55] <MaxFrames> $(this).attr('oldVal',data['val']);
[05:11:42] <FilipNortic> $(this).data("oldVal,data['val']);
[05:12:26] <MaxFrames> don't I need to close the " after oldVal?
[05:12:38] <FilipNortic> $(this).data("oldVal,data['val']));
[05:13:29] <FilipNortic> MaxFrames: yeah missed a " not ) sry
[05:14:15] <MaxFrames> mm, still not working
[05:14:37] <MaxFrames> the instruction that determines if the data has been changed and needs to be committed to the backend is this one:
[05:14:57] <MaxFrames> if(data['oldval'] === data['val']) return false;
[05:15:23] <MaxFrames> and data['oldval'] gets its value from this:
[05:15:29] <MaxFrames> data['oldval'] = $(this).attr('oldVal');
[05:16:40] <MaxFrames> what I am observing is that after changing the value of the cell, if I change it back to the previous value, the change is not detected, which can only mean that $(this).attr('oldVal') is still the original one (determined when the page first loaded)
[05:18:34] <MaxFrames> on the other hand, this is how data['val'] gets its value:
[05:18:44] <MaxFrames> data['val'] = $(this).text();
[05:20:11] <MaxFrames> let's say at the beginning the cell has the value "foo"; I change it to "bar"; .text is now different from .attr('oldVal') so the ajax function is executed
[05:20:29] <FilipNortic> arnet you setting the data['oldValue'] from oldvalue attr and setting oldValue attr from data['oldvalue']
[05:20:33] <MaxFrames> at this point I want .attr('oldVal') to be "bar"
[05:21:22] <MaxFrames> no, I am setting oldValue attr from data['value']
[05:21:27] <FilipNortic> stripes can't really say what's worng... if your still stuck try making a simplified fiddle adn i'll take a look
[05:21:38] <MaxFrames> I'll try
[05:21:43] <stripes> FilipNortic: okay
[05:21:54] <MaxFrames> oops that was not for me
[05:22:46] <FilipNortic> yeah well applies to everyone :) that is usally the best step to get good help
[05:22:53] <FilipNortic> find a way to show your code
[05:23:30] <MaxFrames> working at it
[05:31:47] <MaxFrames> maybe I have found a flaw
[05:33:06] <MaxFrames> the thing is, the "data has been changed" routine is executed when the user moves to a different cell; so at the end of the routing $(this) is no longer the edited cell, but the other cell
[05:35:26] <MaxFrames> by the way, here is my attempt at a simplified fiddle: https://pastebin.com/4LQehCgt
[05:38:20] <stripes> FilipNortic: so here it is https://jsfiddle.net/nzs01f37/4/ ...
[05:38:58] <FilipNortic> stipes all inputs have the same name?
[05:40:03] <FilipNortic> that's the parameter name they get submited as they need a unique name per form
[05:42:20] <stripes> FilipNortic: but it should be array..
[05:42:37] <FilipNortic> stripes: and you need a from-element to use serialize
[05:43:27] <stripes> FilipNortic: here is updated https://jsfiddle.net/nzs01f37/4/
[05:43:54] <stripes> its actually adding them
[05:44:39] <stripes> i still dont know why my code is not working but on the fiddle seems to work
[05:44:41] <FilipNortic> yes but append here need to be a <from> nor a <div>
[05:44:55] <FilipNortic> ahh it won't add i your code?
[05:45:29] <stripes> yes
[05:45:39] <MaxFrames> I think the problem is that $(this) is no longer what I expect it to be after the ajax routine is performed
[05:45:51] <MaxFrames> $(this) becomes the called php page!
[05:47:26] <FilipNortic> can change depending on which function your in
[05:47:45] <MaxFrames> I am in the ajax's "success" function
[05:47:52] <FilipNortic> just save the elemment in a variable and use it there
[05:48:02] <MaxFrames> right
[05:48:05] <Xatenev> HI
[05:48:14] <Xatenev> can I somehow get the real XHR object from jquery $.ajax?
[05:48:32] <Xatenev> or even better if that exists: does jquery have an access to `<xhr>.upload.onprogress`
[05:49:01] <FilipNortic> Xatenev: you're doing file upload?
[05:49:21] <MaxFrames> something like "var myElement = $(this);" ?
[05:49:30] <FilipNortic> yes
[05:49:41] <Xatenev> FilipNortic, aye
[05:50:44] <MaxFrames> it worked! thanks a bunch FilipNortic
[05:55:03] <Xatenev> any1?
[05:55:27] <FilipNortic> ok, not my strong suit but getting the xhr object shouldn't be a problem?
[05:56:24] <Xatenev> duno I tried beforeSend: function(xhr)
[05:56:32] <Xatenev> but the xhr object one gets there doesnt seem to be a real xhr object
[05:56:35] <Xatenev> xhr.upload is undefined
[05:57:28] <FilipNortic> ahh true...
[05:58:28] <stripes> FilipNortic: thanks oh! It looks like someone broke the html and the inputs are not appending where it should go
[05:59:06] <FilipNortic> stripes: ok but sreialize still wont' work unless you have an accual form
[05:59:52] <stripes> yes yes this is not a problem im not using i was suggest to try it to debug
[06:09:55] <FilipNortic> Xatenev:  inside ajaxthere might be  xhr: function() {
[06:09:55] <FilipNortic>               var $xhr = $.ajaxSettings.xhr();
[06:12:25] <Xatenev> FilipNortic, oww thats weird
[06:12:29] <Xatenev> i done that and now my ajax isnt being sent anymore :D
[06:12:41] <Xatenev> I just added https://bpaste.net/show/75cb4d641de8
[06:15:07] <Xatenev> ah fixed it
[06:18:37] <Xatenev> FilipNortic, are you still around?
[06:24:35] <FilipNortic> yes
[06:27:11] <miragee> Hi guys, i've a little html form that sends post data to "gerar.php", that file just download an csv file based on the post params
[06:27:31] <miragee> Can someone help me out build an ajax request for it ?
[06:28:47] <miragee> https://pastebin.com/2BPQe1pk
[06:29:01] <miragee> I've that, but i cant seem to put it downloading the file
[06:29:04] <miragee> Any ideas ?
[06:32:26] <FilipNortic> miragee: but the request fires?
[06:38:49] <miragee> FilipNortic: yes
[06:39:08] <miragee> Just not been able to download the file
[06:39:41] <miragee> It gets display with the alert(result) and i cant find a  way to download it
[06:43:55] <FilipNortic> are you sure you need ajax downloading a file is usally just submiting a fro reguarly...
[07:08:09] <MaxFrames> another question; I am returning a value from ajax in the form of an object; I need to put the VALUE of this object to a variable; what's the syntax?
[07:08:16] <MaxFrames> currently I have this:
[07:08:38] <MaxFrames> var newtimestamp = response.newtimestamp;
[07:09:04] <MaxFrames> if I console.log(newtimestamp) I see it's an OBJECT which embeds the text value I neesd
[07:09:05] <MaxFrames> need
[07:09:28] <MaxFrames> I need to grab this text value and use it to change the value of a cell in the html table
[07:09:37] <MaxFrames> so I need to "convert" the object to text, sort of
[07:16:47] <MaxFrames> to be clear, this is the console.log I get:
[07:16:48] <MaxFrames> Object { Timestamp: "2017-11-30 13:16:15" }
[07:17:07] <MaxFrames> I need to put the part between the "" into a variable
[08:06:57] <Cork> MaxFrames: you need something like that momentjs to do that
[08:07:09] <Cork> or you would have to build a string by hand
[08:07:31] <Cork> javascript has very little helper functions built in for date/time manipulations
[08:07:59] <MaxFrames> it doesn't matter, it's just for display purposes, I will treat it as text
[08:08:15] <MaxFrames> I need to strip everything and keep just "2017-11-30 13:16:15"
[08:08:28] <MaxFrames> (of course the value varies)
[08:09:02] <Cork> MaxFrames: uh... i don't get it then
[08:09:10] <Cork> you mean you just want to access variable.Timestamp ?
[08:10:20] <MaxFrames> I'm exhausted.-. can't think
[08:11:15] <Cork> MaxFrames: https://jsfiddle.net/7176rdtv/
[08:11:57] <MaxFrames> maybe I see
[08:14:56] <MaxFrames> yes. it works, thank you!
[08:30:29] <obk> Hello, this is "select", how can I go by to each "option" of this ?
[08:31:02] <Cork> you mean $(this).find('option') ?
[08:32:09] <obk> Cork: but i want to get all options, .find return only 1
[08:32:20] <Cork> no it doesn't
[08:32:34] <Cork> unless the select only have one option that is
[08:33:16] <obk> Cork: options = $(this).find("option"); return only 1 option
[08:33:26] <obk> when I console.log(options.val()) it return the val
[08:33:37] <Cork> .val() filters out the first element in the selection
[08:33:44] <obk> when I try options.each it don't work
[08:33:45] <Cork> as it can't return a string from more then one source
[08:33:50] <Cork> it should
[08:34:54] <obk> Cork: here is my code https://pastebin.com/kNs5kiNX
[08:34:59] <obk> and this is a select
[08:35:13] <obk> Uncaught TypeError: this.val is not a function
[08:35:13] <obk>     at HTMLOptionElement.<anonymous>
[08:35:14] <Cork> this doesn't have .val()
[08:35:19] <Cork> you need to use $(this).val()
[08:35:38] <obk> Cork: that this is for the options element
[08:35:41] <obk> its inside .each
[08:35:48] <Cork> still
[08:35:51] <obk> ah
[08:36:08] <Cork> obk: https://jsfiddle.net/7176rdtv/1/
[08:36:13] <obk> Cork: u're right bro, it works now
[08:36:16] <obk> thanks
[09:27:32] <jantje> I have a <div> <div class="more"> insert lines after this div</div> <div>other content </div> </div>  and click event on .more. Now. I have a array with content that alsways goes from top to bottom. I want to insert <div>content 1..N</div> -after-   .more. So I'm using $(this).after(" new content"); to insert lines.

[10:05:46] <Aquazi> how do I select divs that have a certain attribute? all of them
[10:05:59] <Aquazi> like $("div").attr("myattr").each()
[10:06:03] <Aquazi> doesn't work
[10:07:30] <amundir> $('div').filter('[myattr]')
[10:07:54] <Aquazi> I don't need .each()?
[10:08:07] <amundir> jquery does an implicit each
[10:16:05] <Aquazi> what's the difference between .filter("myattr") and .filter("[myattr]")
[10:16:23] <amundir> the first won't do anything as that's not a valid selector
[10:16:46] <amundir> there is no html tagName of "myattr"
[10:17:07] <amundir> [] denotes an attribute lookup
[10:17:14] <Aquazi> I'm not actually using jquery, but cheerio
[10:17:19] <Aquazi> so it was returning an object
[10:17:22] <Aquazi> so it was working
[10:17:35] <amundir> the first one works?
[10:17:37] <Aquazi> yes
[10:17:40] <amundir> ok
[10:17:55] <amundir> why are you asking about cheerio logic in jquery?
[10:17:56] <Aquazi> they have different output tho
[10:18:11] <Aquazi> because cheerio is basically jquery on the server
[10:18:14] <Aquazi> it's nearly identical
[10:18:35] <Aquazi> so dom traversing works nearly the same
[10:19:29] <amundir> k
[10:20:50] <amundir> that's weird that that would work then, or that it would find anything.  i'd expect it to return an object, but an empty one
[10:21:39] <Aquazi> taplar, https://repl.it/repls/CautiousNauticalHoki
[10:22:15] <taplar> right, but that example is using []
[10:23:06] <taplar> yeah, it doesn't work without the [] like i said
[10:23:19] <taplar> $("Relationship").filter("[Id]").length;  returns 16
[10:23:26] <taplar> $("Relationship").filter("Id").length; returns 0
[10:24:58] <Aquazi> it still returns an object even tho I don't really understand what it is
[10:25:11] <taplar> right, jquery always returns an object
[10:25:21] <taplar> but with the bad filter, it doesn't have results
[10:25:24] <taplar> thus the 0
[10:25:35] <Aquazi> I see, thank you
[10:25:42] <Aquazi> out of curiosity why change nickname?
[10:26:02] <taplar> fairly busy at work lately.  trying to get some lurking in, :)
[10:26:13] <Aquazi> :)
[10:54:52] <miragee> hi guys, i've an html form that with working w/o any jquery code
[10:55:12] <miragee> it sends a post request to the page gerar.php and it downloads an csv file
[10:55:25] <miragee> now i want to convert it to an ajax request
[10:55:51] <miragee> i've this https://pastebin.com/2BPQe1pk but i cannot seem to find a way to download the file
[10:56:17] <amundir> you have to create a data url iirc
[10:57:43] <amundir> https://stackoverflow.com/a/42815974/1586174
[10:59:06] <miragee> ok let me try to implement that
[11:00:00] <amundir> Out of curiosity though, why change it to ajax?
[11:01:22] <amundir> Because if all you want is the submit to not refresh the page, you can always make it target a new page.  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/896724/how-to-open-a-new-window-on-form-submit#896731
[11:02:02] <amundir> and bypass the whole issue
[11:02:22] <miragee> i've a little spinner
[11:02:33] <miragee> and i want it to stop after download is done
[11:02:52] <amundir> uh, well, how would you do that with javascript?
[11:03:11] <amundir> ah, nvm, the whole file would be the response
[11:03:17] <amundir> blah blah blah, :D
[11:04:08] <miragee> you got any idea to do it without going to the ajax part ?
[11:04:24] <amundir> nah, cause without the ajax, you have no way of knowing when the download is done
[11:04:34] <amundir> afaik
[11:05:10] <amundir> though you might could do an old school iframe trick, but *shrug*
[11:07:11] <amundir> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16144820/javascript-opening-hidden-iframe-for-file-download-on-document-ready
[11:09:14] <amundir> and if you did that, if the iframe is going to the same domain, you should be able to put a load event listener on it
[11:09:42] <amundir> so you could show the spinner, make the iframe with the on load listener, which would hide the spinner when it was loaded
[11:37:09] <Minutazos> Hi, anyone could tell me why after an ajax get, on the success function I call two other functions but they are not wroking? There is the gist: https://gist.github.com/minutazos/3f0fd0f24c604ab59f33227ef711d469 , and the page is hosted on www.josepcano.com
[11:37:58] <amundir> where is the ajax?
[11:38:36] <amundir> nvm
[11:39:46] <Minutazos> you've founded it?
[11:40:02] <amundir> so define "not working"
[11:41:42] <Minutazos> you can see the problem at www.josepcano.com, when I click the load more button, the html content is well appended, but the functions altura and hover doesn't work fine, specially the altura function, this function normally get the img height and apply an inline styling to the div container with this height, but the inline style applied is 0px, but if you refresh the page and you click to load more once, it works fine
[11:42:18] <amundir> so you verified with a console log or something that the methods are being executed?
[11:44:48] <Minutazos> well, I've modified the js with a console log to verify, but with the server cache when i try it, it download the old js, anyway I suppose that if there is some inline style applied (and its applied with the method) but with wrong values, is that they are bein executed no?
[11:45:34] <amundir> i'm just trying to verify at this point that you're altura method is being executed when you think it should be
[11:46:34] <Minutazos> Maybe the error is that the method is being executed before the imgs are loaded and then it applies a 0px height?
[11:47:07] <amundir> if you are trying to get the dimensions before they are loaded, definitely
[11:47:59] <Minutazos> nono, is not the case
[11:48:06] <Minutazos> i do the get before calling methods
[11:48:20] <Minutazos> but maybe, the methods are being executed before the images are loaded
[11:48:59] <Minutazos> how I can set a timepause? Im not very pro with javascript :P I've founded settimeout but I dont know if it can be applied in this context
[11:49:50] <amundir> you can attach an onload event handler to them which will fire when they are loaded
[11:51:09] <Minutazos> you mean writhe the html like this?: <div id="container" onload="altura(portfolio)"><img /></div>  ?
[11:52:16] <amundir> no.  you can do $('#portfolio').find('.item img').on('load', ...);
[11:54:56] <Minutazos> okay thanks, ill try this
[12:04:02] <fuchstronaut> posting data to PHP via jQuerys AJAX. Request contains a serialized string. Can't access any of it in PHP. $_POST is emtpy, input_filter is NULL, php://input is empty. What am I doing wrong?
[12:06:58] <amundir> show you're script?
[12:09:08] <fuchstronaut> amundir: https://pastebin.com/NS9rWy4Y
[12:10:19] <amundir> those keys should exist in your $_POST if that is your code
[12:11:28] <fuchstronaut> well... they dont
[12:11:48] <amundir> any console errors?
[12:11:58] <fuchstronaut> sadly none
[12:12:21] <amundir> and did you look at the request in the network tab to see the request data being put on it?
[12:12:35] <fuchstronaut> in my dev console (chrome) i have 4 tabs for that request
[12:12:42] <fuchstronaut> Headers, Preview, Response, Timing
[12:12:52] <fuchstronaut> should I have a tab for the request data?
[12:12:54] <amundir> headers, look at the request one
[12:13:09] <fuchstronaut> There is no sign of my data
[12:13:52] <fuchstronaut> could it be that jQuery 1.7.1 is the issue?
[12:14:07] <amundir> under headers there should be a Query String Parameters section.  that is empty?
[12:14:45] <fuchstronaut> amundir: No such header
[12:17:33] <amundir> https://i.imgur.com/ZEIp3Dr.png  you don't see something like that?
[12:18:05] <fuchstronaut> amundir: strange, but no
[12:18:15] <fuchstronaut> I have "General", "Response Headers" and "Request Headers"
[12:18:37] <fuchstronaut> This explains why I can't access it on the backend
[12:19:43] <amundir> So then that leads me to believe there is some discrepency between the code that you shared, and what you are actually doing
[12:20:31] <amundir> because posting with a non-empty object, like you are showing, would cause those keys to be put in the query params on the request.
[12:21:55] <amundir> brb
[12:23:00] <fuchstronaut> amundir_food: i swapped out post for ajax({ url: url, data: dataObj })
[12:23:04] <fuchstronaut> now I have query string param
[12:28:23] <amundir> wait, you were doing post()?
[12:28:49] <amundir> your paste was using $.ajax
[12:29:06] <amundir> if you want to use $.post it's just $.post(url, dataObject, function () { ... });
[12:29:36] <fuchstronaut> i tried both
[12:29:58] <fuchstronaut> When using $.post(url, dataObj) I still do GET requests, how is that possible?
[12:30:14] <amundir> it shouldn't be
[12:30:44] <amundir> unless you pass in the optional data type of 'script'.  i believe if you do that it forces it to be a get
[12:31:22] <fuchstronaut> amundir: thank you for your help
[12:31:26] <fuchstronaut> appreciate your time
[12:31:30] <amundir> np
[12:31:51] <fuchstronaut> clear
[12:31:54] <fuchstronaut> whoops
[12:32:25] <fuchstronaut> turns out an url like '/feedback' leads to a GET request beeing sent
[12:32:38] <fuchstronaut> with '/feedback/' i get my post request
[12:33:04] <fuchstronaut> that helped me: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12195883/jquery-ajax-is-sending-get-instead-of-post
[12:33:21] <fuchstronaut> this behaviour seems really strange, but I am still using jQuery 1.7.1 here, so maybe it is fixed already
[12:34:28] <amundir> ah, if you read the comments, someone mentions something about a redirect
[12:36:09] <amundir> so you were hitting a bad endpoint, the server is redirecting with a get, which looses your data
[13:36:28] * fireboi[m] sent a long message: fireboi[m]_2017-11-30_18:36:26.txt <https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/matrix.org/yOdDRUJkMApRDctnkAQrpxwZ>
[13:37:13] <amundir> fireboi[m]: wut?
[13:37:21] <fireboi[m]> the if get always executed
[13:37:35] <amundir> can you post whatever you tried to msg me in the room?  i didn't get it
[13:38:14] <fireboi[m]> oh u are on irc
[13:38:19] <fireboi[m]> oops
[13:38:47] <fireboi[m]> https://hastebin.com/inuvekelec.js
[13:39:07] <amundir> you can't chain <= like that
[13:39:23] <fireboi[m]> :(
[13:39:26] <amundir> one of the two pairs will resolve to true/false before the next <= happens
[13:39:34] <amundir> which doesn't make sense, :)
[13:39:40] <fireboi[m]> do i really have to put && ...
[13:39:43] <amundir> yes
[13:40:05] <fireboi[m]> python can chain <=
[13:40:18] <amundir> you not doing python, :P
[13:40:20] <fireboi[m]> oh well
[13:41:03] <fireboi[m]> yeah ik fcking uni work xD
[13:41:57] <fireboi[m]> (startXmas <= arrDate && arrDate <= endXmas || startXmas <= deDate && deDate <= endXmas)
[13:42:14] <amundir> i'd do it a little differently
[13:42:42] <amundir> (startXmas<= endXmaz)  //for the common part
[13:43:19] <amundir> (startXmas<= endXmaz && arrDate <= deDate) //more common?
[13:43:40] <fireboi[m]> ??
[13:43:55] <amundir> should the arrDate be before or equal to the deDate?
[13:43:57] <fireboi[m]> i need the dates to be between the XMAS
[13:44:36] <fireboi[m]> the task is to block booking for the xmas period
[13:45:15] <amundir> k
[13:45:50] <fireboi[m]> can the condition be shortened then?
[13:48:04] <amundir> maybe
[13:48:07] <fireboi[m]> ok it works thx
[13:50:10] <amundir> mmm, all the things i'd want to use to make it smaller are ES6.  :(
[13:50:51] <amundir> you could make a little function though
[13:51:33] <amundir> var betweenDates = function (date) { return ( startXmas <= date && date <= endXmas); }
[13:51:44] <amundir> and then you'd call that in your if twice
[14:48:43] <noodl_> when type @gmail.com It should show correct ---> https://jsfiddle.net/c9z6114u/
[14:58:11] <noodl_> this do what I want --> https://jsfiddle.net/c9z6114u/1/
[14:58:51] <noodl_> think I got it to work :)
[15:00:31] <grapheti> So someone can type "@gmail.com" and it will successfully submit on your form?
[18:36:28] <lewix> are forms always submitted without ajax engine involved by default
[18:36:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:36:53] <robertmaxrees> "ajax engine"?
[18:37:02] <taplar> hey, robs alive
[18:37:14] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  was out sick for a few days.
[18:37:18] <robertmaxrees> fever spiked to 101.
[18:37:21] <robertmaxrees> it was good times.
[18:37:23] <taplar> too much turkey
[18:37:27] <robertmaxrees> hah
[18:37:29] <robertmaxrees> i wish./
[18:37:30] <lewix> robertmaxrees: yes - when we use the property action of html
[18:38:12] <robertmaxrees> lewix still lost on what "ajax engine" means, but so long as you meet the minimum requirements for a form it will always submit normally.
[18:38:22] <robertmaxrees> ajax is something you have to explicitly setup.
[18:39:15] <lewix> robertmaxress great. so it's normal as i thought
[18:39:26] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[18:39:54] <lewix> robertmaxrees: however when you say ajax is something that we have to explicitly set up - im not sure i follow - almost all server request today from the front end layer involve ajax
[18:40:07] <taplar> why do you say that?
[18:40:14] <lewix> getJSON, ajax///etc
[18:40:22] <robertmaxrees> that's all stuff you still have to setup.
[18:40:24] <taplar> sure, but that's not form submission
[18:40:36] <lewix> ah so you were referring to form sumission only
[18:40:41] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, they're just requests.
[18:40:41] <lewix> sorry misunderstood your statement
[18:41:00] <robertmaxrees> well, my statement was specific to forms.
[18:41:04] <taplar> "lewix
[18:41:05] <taplar> "lewix: are forms always submitted without ajax engine involved by default "
[18:41:18] <robertmaxrees> but in general, web requests aren't ajax unless you set them up to be.
[18:41:27] <robertmaxrees> forms included.
[18:41:43] <lewix> taplar: yes that was my question, but I misunderstood the answer - i thought the statement was general outisde of forms
[18:42:15] <taplar> k
[18:42:35] <robertmaxrees> i mean, it wasn't, but the same generally applies./
[18:42:35] <lewix> robertmaxrees: web requests aren't aax unless you set them up you say -
[18:42:41] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[18:42:47] <lewix> so how is that so, when do you make we requests normally?
[18:42:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:43:13] <lewix> can you give me examples of how you do it today without ajax
[18:43:15] <taplar> typing a url in the browser is a web request
[18:43:18] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:43:21] <robertmaxrees> a script tag.
[18:43:22] <taplar> iframes are web requests
[18:43:23] <robertmaxrees> css tag.
[18:43:24] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[18:43:26] <taplar> images
[18:43:33] <robertmaxrees> writing a script tag into the page using js.
[18:43:56] <robertmaxrees> anything that isn't using $.ajax, getJSON, the fetch api, etc.
[18:44:40] <lewix> good point- I did not include that in my wrong definition of web requests. what about web requests that are made in the codebase, excluding importing libraries
[18:44:52] <robertmaxrees> like?
[18:44:53] <taplar> heh
[18:45:58] <grapheti> I always request my wife to get a beer, but she never does. :(
[18:46:21] <taplar> maybe she does, and she drinks it
[18:46:27] <taplar> you need to clarify your AC
[18:46:27] <grapheti> LMAO
[18:46:41] <robertmaxrees> brb
[18:46:56] <lewix> robertmaxrees: my point is if you make a server request to an api from the frontend in your codebase, isn't it almost certainly ajax unless you explicitly say not to
[18:47:12] <taplar> no
[18:47:34] <taplar> any request for a resource that doesn't explicitly use a method that is ajax, isn't ajax
[18:47:34] <lewix> grapheti: try to ask for water..
[18:47:47] <lewix> taplar: give me an example
[18:47:53] <lewix> i am not sure i express myself properly
[18:47:54] <taplar> images, webfonts
[18:47:56] <taplar> iframes
[18:48:19] <taplar> websockets, technically are not ajax either
[18:48:22] <lewix> "f you make a server request to an api from the frontend in your codebase" excluding images, webfont, url change
[18:48:27] <lewix> iframes,
[18:48:56] <taplar> lol, if you are reducing the scope of your question that much, then yes, you're probably doing ajax
[18:49:07] <lewix> i didn't reduce it
[18:49:10] <taplar> but that's not the majority of web requests
[18:49:11] <lewix> that was always my question
[18:49:41] <lewix> taplar: which is a good point. I excluded the other thing because i was so focus on those specific web requests
[18:49:45] <lewix> which created confusion
[18:51:27] <lewix> so in other words if you want to make a request in your codebase that does not import a library or change the url, or use iframes it is very likely it is an ajax requests unless you hack it using forms
[18:52:03] <lewix> or do not explicitly pass the XMLHTTPReqquest header
[18:52:07] <taplar> i wouldn't say using forms is a hack
[18:52:23] <taplar> that's like, legit original methodology
[18:52:58] <taplar> ajax is for if you want to request a resource, without reloading the page, in the broadest sense
[18:53:25] <lewix> example of hack https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2054705/non-ajax-jquery-post-request
[18:53:36] <lewix> to put it into context
[18:54:29] <lewix> it just seems that for those type of request that are just a small portion of web requests - it seems that - the default is ajax
[18:55:05] <taplar> The go to, sure
[18:56:35] <taplar> I'm not sure though now that S.O. post qualifies as ajax though
[18:56:41] <taplar> r/now/how/
[18:56:46] <lewix> sorry for the annoying questiomns not clearly expressed
[18:56:49] <lewix> thank yu
