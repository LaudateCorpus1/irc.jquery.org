[00:03:20] <halluz> didn't intend to close out - whoever asked for help last, can you repost?
[00:04:05] <craea> hi! anyone can help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/2T49s/1/ :>
[00:05:21] <halluz> I assume you are trying to get the text to the right of the selector to reflect the value of the selector?
[00:05:55] <craea> yes
[00:06:55] <trepe> hi! What should I do to make the .live event work on this child .selected? Was trying $(this).(".selected").live;..
[00:10:16] <Hooloovoo> trepe: you shouldn't use .live any more
[00:10:44] <Hooloovoo> try .on() instead
[00:10:46] <trepe> Hooloovoo, heard about 'on' will use that, but anyways..
[00:11:06] <Hooloovoo> to find the element you do $(this).find(".selected")
[00:11:59] <trepe> Hooloovoo, ha 'on'  worked :)   $(this).children(".slider-right").on...
[00:12:07] <trepe> Hooloovoo, thank you
[00:13:16] <Hooloovoo> trepe: sweet! :)
[00:29:35] <craea> help me with this http://jsfiddle.net/2T49s/11/ :(
[00:33:10] <lxsameer> i use a simple slideDown for showing a div , but its animation sucks , how can i improve it ?
[00:39:33] <trepe> I have two events in my plugin, is that normal if one event changes an value of an option, the second one won't see the changes?
[00:42:52] <trepe> .. nevermind, found the problem.
[00:46:27] <trinadh> craea: http://jsfiddle.net/2T49s/12/
[00:47:23] <trinadh> craea: remove the extra td then the second next('td') can be removed in code
[00:47:41] <trinadh> craea: am not sure if it is the best way or not, but it works :)
[00:58:03] <trinadh> craea: let me know if it worked for you
[01:00:41] <trepe> When animating 'left' for an object, I can just set the value which will increase / decrease current distance, or is it possible just to say - animate left to 0?
[01:01:54] <NodeX> both
[01:03:14] <craea> trinadh: yeah it worked, thanks =)
[01:04:00] <trinadh> craea: welcome
[01:04:28] <trepe> NodeX, hmn, when having left:600 and trying  sliderObjects.animate({"left": "=400px"},100); nothing changes, but sliderObjects.animate({"left": "-=200px"},100); Positions correctly,
[01:10:25] <NodeX> try left:'400px'
[01:13:11] <trepe> NodeX, that worked, thank you!
[01:20:12] <NodeX> ;)

[02:09:39] <Xabster> It gives me "error please use POST", but the code is from a tutorial
[02:09:56] <Xabster> i don't get that error when run locally - might be because of a missing .php file?
[02:10:03] <gandol> trinadh: that also didn't do it
[02:10:17] <Xabster> regardless, my real question is how to get the result of a php-file back from a call like my jquery in the paste
[02:10:27] <gandol> jQuery('label[for=user_login1]').text('new Value'); << this is what i used
[02:10:35] <Xabster> do i just echo stuff? it's supposed to put it in the div i made for it
[02:11:53] <trinadh> gandol: fiddle what you are trying to do

[02:27:23] <geiregjo> Does anyone have an idea what the issue might be?
[02:27:35] <geiregjo> Basically I get a click after my taphold is finished
[02:50:37] <burg> hello. i have 3 radio buttons named: 'radio' . if i add $("input[name=radio]").on("change", function() {}); that function is being called 3 times for every change - is this normal?
[02:52:37] <sheilablackrose> any jquery expert in the house?
[02:53:13] <Hooloovoo> sheilablackrose: nope
[02:53:20] <Hooloovoo> =(
[02:53:31] <sheilablackrose> any jquery intermediate level  in the house?
[02:54:13] <Hooloovoo> just ask and you'll probably get a answer =)
[02:55:08] <sheilablackrose> im trying to get the distinct values from the hidden field. kinda stuck as im new to jquery. http://jsfiddle.net/zqCNN/26/   not even shure if what ive done so far is right
[02:57:17] <Hooloovoo> sheilablackrose: i'm not sure what you're trying to do
[02:57:54] <sheilablackrose> ok
[02:58:07] <sheilablackrose> its technically a dynamic table
[02:58:10] <Hooloovoo> but one problem i can see if that you use the same id on many places
[02:58:27] <sheilablackrose> each row represents a doc from a db
[02:58:57] <sheilablackrose> the doc has 2 main fields that i need one is docid which im using as the checkbox id and the other is flagsid which is a string of flags
[02:59:10] <sheilablackrose> so the data will b like this
[02:59:54] <sheilablackrose> row1 docid=1  flagid = 1,2,3    row2 docid=2, flagid = 1,2,3,4  n so on.
[03:00:14] <sheilablackrose> what i need is to get only the same flagid that exist in any row that is checked
[03:00:22] <sheilablackrose> so for this case it will b 1,2,3
[03:01:42] <sheilablackrose> the doc id or checkbox will b diff
[03:02:04] <sheilablackrose> well the id doesnt matter to me what i need is means to get the flagids or put them as value
[03:20:16] <majuscule> Is there any way to use the easing functions raw? as in, with a custom animation function, i'd just like the values from the easing function

[04:14:01] <Krisostoomus> I tried something like this class={sorter: false}, but it didn't do anything.
[04:14:03] <rindolf> Krisostoomus: you mean you want to keep the rows out of being sorted?

[04:16:36] <manuelbieh_> hey
[04:16:38] <finnnnnnnnnnn> how do I set up a global ajax handler - something that could call a function that is called on the complete of any ajax request?
[04:16:53] <manuelbieh_> what's the easiest way to select a node whose .text() is "Foobar"?
[04:17:06] <manuelbieh_> is need something like $('a[text()=Foo]')
[04:17:12] <manuelbieh_> -s
[04:18:48] <seutje> ?contains @ manuelbieh_
[04:18:50] <bot-t> manuelbieh_, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/

[04:32:02] <sheilablackrose> heloo
[04:32:05] <rindolf> sheilablackrose: you can get my attention by saying "rindolf: ".
[04:32:17] <sheilablackrose> nice
[04:32:33] <rindolf> sheilablackrose: anyway, you can use { ... } for hashes/associative-arrays/dictionaries/maps/etc.
[04:33:51] <geiregjo> are ghost clicks handled in jquery mobile?
[04:36:35] <geiregjo> Bleh, why does nobody ever answer in this channel
[04:38:12] <rindolf> geoffw8_: hi.
[04:38:20] <rindolf> geiregjo: I don't know what ghost clicks are.
[04:39:36] <geiregjo> Ow
[04:39:54] <geiregjo> I've been digging out a bug in IOS.
[04:40:36] <geiregjo> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13917730/click-event-triggered-after-taphold
[04:41:26] <geiregjo> I only encounter the bug in IOS. After my long tab a click is invoked at the same spot i released my finger from the screen to end the taphold.
[04:42:36] <geiregjo> And after 2 days of googling and trying stuff I found out that these might be ghost clicks. But I'm wondering if they are handled by jqm or not. If not I have to fix it myself, If they are then there is a bug somewhre in the framework ...
[04:42:45] <_bart> why does Cmd+V doesn't count as a key press event?
[04:43:21] <geiregjo> rindolf, Am I making sense to you?
[04:43:56] <rindolf> geiregjo: let me see.
[04:44:29] <_bart> ah, keyup
[04:44:48] <CIDIC> any query mobile experts around?
[04:45:20] <rindolf> geiregjo: I have no idea. Did you try reading the code, or debugging it using a JS debugger?
[04:45:27] <geiregjo> ofcource
[04:45:42] <geiregjo> When I release my finger from the screen
[04:45:51] <geiregjo> a mousedown and mouseup are triggered on the element underneath
[04:46:06] <geiregjo> together this makes a click event
[04:46:18] <geiregjo> I don't really know what to debug more
[04:46:48] <geiregjo> I know what happens, I just don't know why.
[04:47:05] <geiregjo> It's like the taphold is picked up by jqm but the native behaviour is not prevented
[04:49:59] <geiregjo> rindolf, do you have pointers in what direction I should look?
[04:50:31] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i have an iframe in my page and i want to update my page's height when the iframe content changes... How can i do that?
[04:50:32] <burg> Uncaught TypeError: Property 'submit' of object #<HTMLFormElement> is not a function -- i get this error when i try to submit a form with jquery: $("#form-id").submit()
[04:50:41] <rindolf> geiregjo: well, I mean if you tried to debug the code of jQm itself.
[04:51:07] <geiregjo> I'm looking into it
[04:51:24] <geiregjo> I found some chinese guy making remarks about a possible fix.
[04:51:29] <geiregjo> http://imyelo.com/  -> 4. taphold
[04:51:46] <geiregjo> I tried it but It didn't work.
[04:52:02] <geiregjo> I'll try debugging it more
[05:09:55] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i have an iframe in my page and i want to update my page's height when the iframe content changes... How can i do that?
[05:10:15] <robert_> eww iframe
[05:10:45] <robert_> the '90s called, and they want their dynamic content back, thanks. :p
[05:13:05] <rindolf> robert_: someone suggested I use an <iframe> for the navigation menu on http://www.shlomifish.org/ .
[05:13:35] <robert_> ewww.
[05:13:37] <NodeX> dont listen to people who tell you to use an iframe for navigtion
[05:13:51] <robert_> I concur with NodeX. :D
[05:13:55] <rindolf> Krambiorix: is your iframe's URL changing?
[05:14:10] <Krambiorix> rindolf, sometimes
[05:14:20] <Krambiorix> rindolf, but always within the same domain
[05:14:36] <rindolf> Well, I ended up using jqTree which loads the data using AJAX to a static JSON file and processes it.
[05:14:49] <rindolf> With a fallback for non-JS.
[05:15:02] <jds> Heya
[05:15:08] <rindolf> Krambiorix: is that what you mean by "content changes"?
[05:15:18] <rindolf> Krambiorix: or do you mean any part of the DOM has changed?
[05:15:19] <jds> Why do the jquery docs seem to recommend $('foo').get(0) rather than just $('foo')[0] ?
[05:15:22] <rindolf> jds: hi.
[05:15:37] <Krambiorix> rindolf, the main page didn't change, the content of the iframe did
[05:16:02] <rindolf> Krambiorix: I see.
[05:16:56] <rindolf> Krambiorix: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2844565/is-there-a-jquery-dom-change-listener/11546242#11546242
[05:17:32] <Krambiorix> rindolf, that's not the problem , my problem is retrieving the height of the content of the iframe
[05:18:46] <rindolf> Krambiorix: ah.
[05:19:05] <rindolf> Krambiorix: you can try $("iframe#id"), no?
[05:19:39] <Krambiorix> rindolf, and then ... ?
[05:20:05] <rindolf> Krambiorix: DOM inspect it.
[05:20:21] <rindolf> I don't remember how to query the height using jQ.
[05:22:24] <Krambiorix> rindolf, do you know how to check if the frame source has loaded
[05:22:56] <rindolf> Krambiorix: there's the onLoad() handler.
[05:24:10] <NodeX> if the iframe is on the same domain you can query it's contents() and find the highest div to get the height quite easily
[05:24:22] <NodeX> or the body

[05:57:46] <NeDra> ..
[05:57:51] <Wh1tebird> When installing jQuery tablesorter, http://tablesorter.com/docs/ , i have some errors, my pagination is always on the wrong place
[05:58:25] <NeDra> pagination?
[05:58:34] <Wh1tebird> Yes, it's a plugin for tablesorter
[05:58:48] <Wh1tebird> dividing table into smaller tables
[05:58:57] <NeDra> oh never used the pagination plugin, but i have tablesorter used a lot
[05:59:18] <Wh1tebird> Can you look into the pagination part for me?
[05:59:39] <NeDra> so something like this
[05:59:39] <NeDra> http://tablesorter.com/docs/example-pager.html
[06:00:08] <Wh1tebird> I followed that example
[06:00:15] <NeDra> cute never seen that
[06:00:21] <NeDra> where does it show for you?
[06:00:24] <Wh1tebird> What it didn't say is that i had to make a pagination div
[06:00:29] <Wh1tebird> https://subversion.khk.be/projecten/TI_1213project16/cursusbeheer/cursusbeheer.php/course/index/manage
[06:00:40] <Wh1tebird> Sorry, i mean this page : https://subversion.khk.be/projecten/TI_1213project16/cursusbeheer/cursusbeheer.php/course
[06:01:10] <NeDra> k the issue is the space between the table and the pagination?
[06:01:13] <Wh1tebird> Yes
[06:01:14] <NeDra> that can be fixed with css
[06:01:29] <Wh1tebird> Even when i removed the CSS it handled this way
[06:01:37] <Wh1tebird> i'll edit the css quickly to remove the excessive ones
[06:02:23] <NeDra> <div style="top: 401px; position: absolute;" id="pager" class="pager">
[06:03:27] <NeDra> hum you know what...
[06:03:40] <NeDra> when you change the amount, it auto change the top value
[06:03:44] <NeDra> dynamically
[06:03:49] <NeDra> if you put it to 5 it switch to
[06:03:50] <NeDra> <div style="top: 314px; position: absolute;" id="pager" class="pager">
[06:04:07] <NeDra> 314px <-- that the issue
[06:04:58] <Wh1tebird> aah yes
[06:05:05] <NeDra> k so the space really is created from the pager plugin...
[06:05:14] <Wh1tebird> So, i'll probably have to remove some code
[06:05:55] <NeDra> still seem weird
[06:06:04] <NeDra> i dont think you should have to edit it
[06:07:07] <NeDra> can you change
[06:07:15] <NeDra> $("#overzichtCursussen").tablesorter();
[06:07:15] <NeDra> $("#overzichtCursussen").tablesorterPager({container: $("#pager")});
[06:07:17] <NeDra> to
[06:07:58] <NeDra> {widthFixed: true}
[06:08:02] <NeDra> in the tablesorter
[06:08:11] <NeDra> not sure it will help
[06:10:03] <NeDra> oh got it
[06:10:04] <NeDra> .table {
[06:10:04] <NeDra>   width: 100%;
[06:10:05] <NeDra>   margin-bottom: 20px;
[06:10:05] <NeDra> }
[06:10:10] <NeDra> you got that in your css
[06:10:30] <NeDra> in bootstrap.css
[06:10:43] <NodeX> use a pastebin
[06:10:45] <NeDra> it make that all table have a 20px margin at the bottom
[06:10:53] <Wh1tebird> I'll temporarily remove it
[06:11:31] <Wh1tebird> removed it
[06:11:41] <NeDra> that or just make #overzichtCursussen {margin -> 0} om your css and it would fix it
[06:11:58] <trinadh> try {container: $('#pager'), pagerPositionSet : true}
[06:12:43] <trinadh> may be it wont work
[06:13:34] <Wh1tebird> It works atm when viewing, but when edited (change value on dropdown) it reverts to old state
[06:13:48] <Wh1tebird> That + pagedisplay isn't working
[06:20:29] <BLeg> Hi guys, I'm having a problem with jQuery in Chrome. I've built a website that uses it, everything runs as expected when in Firefox. When I load the site in Chrome, nothing works. I've gotten to the point where I've stripped _everything_ from the site other than a 2 divs and 3 lines of javascript. No dice. I've noticed that document.ready is not firing. Is there some jQuery rules for Chrome that I'm not aware of?

[06:23:03] <geiregjo> try it in anonymous mode
[06:23:13] <geiregjo> I mean incognito
[06:23:15] <geiregjo> ><
[06:23:34] <BLeg> lol... hmmmm, will do
[06:23:43] <geiregjo> I sometimes get jquery related errors in Chrome that break things without making any sense.
[06:23:52] <geiregjo> I never get these issues in incognito mode.
[06:24:09] <geiregjo> Do you get a Jquery error in your log?
[06:24:29] <BLeg> Not that I noticed\
[06:24:29] <trinadh> i thought IE is the one that breaks...
[06:24:48] <BLeg> Although I'm not 100% sure how to check, I use FF for everything
[06:25:12] <geiregjo> ctrl + shift + i
[06:25:16] <geiregjo> opens the chrome debug tools
[06:25:24] <geiregjo> I'm an ex FF user
[06:25:28] <geiregjo> I switched :)
[06:25:41] <NiteRain> geiregjo: you will be back.
[06:25:41] <BLeg> geiregjo: Nothing in incog
[06:25:46] <NiteRain> jk'ng
[06:26:10] <BLeg> No no, he'll be back
[06:26:19] <BLeg> Firebug in Chrome is somewhat of a joke lol
[06:26:46] <geiregjo> Lol :p
[06:26:54] <geiregjo> I'm quite pleased with chrome thank you
[06:27:00] <geiregjo> Firefox is to slow
[06:27:08] <geiregjo> *too
[06:27:39] <WeThePeople> hi, can somebody help me with this script, i dont want the pictures to go out side the website>>> http://experiencefinejewelry.host22.com/
[06:29:32] <seutje> <BLeg> Firebug in Chrome is somewhat of a joke lol <- that quote is a keeper

[06:57:24] <lanken_> is it ok to use multiple $(document).ready events?
[06:58:03] <lxsameer> is it possible to use jquery selector to select some tags inside a string ? (the string contains html code)
[07:00:19] <gandol> lanken: yes but better you put them all in one
[07:04:22] <lanken_> lxsameer: try the .attr method
[07:04:36] <BLeg> lanken_: It doesn't make sense in the same file, but across multiple files/libraries is fine
[07:04:43] <lanken_> lxsameer: oh, you have a String variable in JS?
[07:05:42] <lanken_> lxsameer: not sure how you would do that. one way might be to park it in the DOM somewhere invisible, and modify it using jquery, then move it to somewhere else in the DOM once it's ready.
[07:06:09] <lxsameer> lanken_: thanks man
[07:07:14] <lanken> np. I'm new to jQuery myself so there may be a better way.
[07:12:02] <seutje> lxsameer: u don't need to add it to the DOM, and it's cheaper not to
[07:12:32] <lxsameer> seutje: i think $(data) will do the trick
[07:12:40] <seutje> $(arbitrary-html-string).find('sometag') works fine
[07:12:50] <seutje> if u wanna manipulate it, u prolly want to store it though
[07:14:33] <seutje> var foo = $(arbitrary-html-string); foo.find('sometag').addClass('sillyexample'); $('body').append(foo); will append ur html string and sometag will have the sillyexample class on it
[07:14:38] <seutje> lxsameer: ^
[07:15:08] <halcyon1234> jqm: Are there any good style guides for error message positioning in mobile apps?
[07:15:08] <lxsameer> seutje: thanks man
[07:16:02] <nip> Hello - Is it possible to add jQuery UI components after it's loaded? ie, I'd like to add in the Tooltip feature
[07:20:39] <lanken> I have a function that loads new content via XHR and then displays the content.
[07:21:55] <lanken> sometimes the content has been prefetched, so I currentry redisplay running the "draw" function both before and after the fetch.
[07:22:05] <NodeX> congrats
[07:22:23] <lanken> this is bad for two reasons. First, it's wasteful to do a second draw in the event that the first draw had everything
[07:23:12] <lanken> worse, if the user initiates redisplay twice in quick succession, the second call to draw() from his first click will frequently cause a flash.
[07:24:02] <lanken> I guess I can disable this with a global variable ? would that be how you'd go about it?
[07:26:00] <Krambiorix> i want to remove a background from a div , but this doesn't work: $('.wrapper').css({ 'background-image': '' });   -> what's wrong??
[07:26:18] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: use 'none' instead of ''
[07:26:27] <lanken> Krambiorix: try it with .css( "background-image", "")
[07:26:42] <lanken> Krambiorix: I had trouble with passing Objects to .css
[07:27:58] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, lanken , that doesn't work :s
[07:29:57] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: I just tested none and it worked.
[07:30:18] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: http://jsbin.com/abezow/1/edit
[07:30:24] <lanken> Krambiorix: can you post your code to JSfiddle?
[07:31:25] <Krambiorix> ok i will
[07:31:52] <Krambiorix> but i just see with "inspect element" that the background is gone in the code, but i can still see it :s
[07:32:07] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: Does the parent element have the same background image?
[07:32:15] <BillCriswell> Or some grand parent?
[07:32:33] <BillCriswell> { 'background-image' : 'none' } definitely works as you can see with my code.
[07:36:28] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, yes i see, but here it doesn't :s
[07:36:43] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[07:37:41] <the_kick> hi
[07:38:07] <the_kick> can someone explain what the smi-colon is for here?
[07:38:08] <the_kick> ;(function ($, window, undefined) {
[07:38:25] <the_kick> the first line of the plugin is like that
[07:38:27] <klawd> the_kick: it looks quite nice.
[07:39:03] <BillCriswell> you can't argue with those aesthetics.
[07:39:07] <the_kick> klawd: yea, granted, it looks like a sad guy winking
[07:39:12] <the_kick> but whats it for?
[07:39:12] <klawd> the_kick: yes.
[07:39:18] <klawd> the_kick: seriously: it's useless
[07:39:45] <BinaryKitten> actually it's not useless
[07:39:52] <the_kick> all the zub foundation plugins contain it
[07:39:59] <the_kick> *zurb
[07:40:01] <BinaryKitten> it's to prevent other people's broken code affecting this code
[07:40:04] <the_kick> its confuzzling m
[07:40:05] <the_kick> w
[07:40:06] <BillCriswell> the_kick: I think it's in case someone has forgotten one in a script before it?
[07:40:09] <klawd> its an the_kick it's an empty statement
[07:40:11] <the_kick> ah ok i see
[07:40:33] <BinaryKitten> the_kick on some older browsers they didn't auto insert the semi-colon
[07:40:43] <the_kick> BinaryKitten: makes sense thanks
[07:40:45] <klawd> BinaryKitten: how could code in another file affect this one?
[07:40:57] <BinaryKitten> klawd
[07:41:10] <BinaryKitten> $.get('blah',
[07:41:23] <klawd> eh?
[07:41:24] <BillCriswell> the_kick: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1873983/what-does-the-leading-semicolon-in-javascript-libraries-do
[07:41:35] <the_kick> BillCriswell: hehe thanks
[07:41:38] <BinaryKitten> klawd it's mainly for when you merge and compress
[07:41:46] <klawd> ah, ok
[07:42:07] <klawd> BinaryKitten: i thought about merging my code as well
[07:42:14] <BinaryKitten> means the function gets it's own calling/etc rather than being mucked up because of some idiots
[07:42:15] <klawd> but it would have to be done on a per-directory basis?
[07:42:25] <BinaryKitten> klawd if you can, then you should
[07:42:28] <BillCriswell> Actually, this seems more thorough http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2481543/why-does-the-javascript-need-to-start-with
[07:42:53] <klawd> BinaryKitten: a good merging lib should append the semi colon anyway if it's not there though, eh?
[07:43:03] <BinaryKitten> klawd no
[07:43:12] <BinaryKitten> a good merging lib makes no assumptions on the code
[07:43:23] <BillCriswell> The NickCarver dude must stalk that site.
[07:43:30] <klawd> BinaryKitten: -v
[07:43:30] <BillCriswell> Nick Craver*
[07:43:40] <BinaryKitten> negative why?
[07:43:55] <klawd> BinaryKitten: i mean: explain pls
[07:44:01] <the_kick> i came
[07:44:01] <the_kick> i stirred up things
[07:44:01] <the_kick> i left
[07:44:03] <the_kick> :P
[07:44:12] <the_kick> sry
[07:44:38] <BinaryKitten> klawd there are a lot of tricks and code parts you can use. The merging lib cannot take all of these into consideration every time
[07:44:50] <BinaryKitten> it can only deal with what it has at the time of building
[07:45:08] <klawd> BinaryKitten: a compression lib will make assumptions on the code as well, no?
[07:45:10] <BinaryKitten> so, the best ones, do a good job merging properly but don't touch the code
[07:45:20] <BinaryKitten> compression libs are different to merging
[07:45:38] <BinaryKitten> a compression lib isn't guarenteed to not break code either
[07:45:53] <BinaryKitten> that's why people still use minify
[07:46:03] <klawd> BinaryKitten: what's the difference?
[07:46:07] <BinaryKitten> because that only removes unrequired whitespace
[07:46:19] <klawd> ah.
[07:46:21] <BinaryKitten> a compressor rewrites code into a more compressed form
[07:46:33] <BinaryKitten> like packer, google closure compiler etc
[07:46:41] <klawd> if i would write such a tool, i would do compress, then merge
[07:46:48] <BinaryKitten> yes definitely
[07:46:53] <klawd> and put semicolons between the merged files
[07:47:15] <BinaryKitten> compress, test, recompress, test.. (rinse & repeat) merge
[07:47:23] <vicep> Hi all,
[07:47:27] <vicep> any clue on how to pass more than one parameter to a ajax request on the Jquery Autocomplete?
[07:47:41] <vicep> please see the description: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13955981/how-to-use-jqueryautocomplete-sending-more-than-one-parameter-on-the-request
[07:48:37] * BinaryKitten hunts for food
[07:48:53] * BinaryKitten stalks a cup of coffee & mince pie..
[07:49:03] <saltcod> Hey all. In this screenshot, could someone help me identify/annotate the parts?
[07:49:06] <saltcod> http://cl.ly/image/1o1O370t401k
[07:49:09] <saltcod> It's a siaf, so it runs when the page loads.  contactForm is an object(?), container is a variable acessible via contactForm.container, and init and show are methods that that object has?
[07:49:09] <BillCriswell> You misspelled mice.
[07:49:33] <Krambiorix>  BillCriswell i see in my developer tools that there is an inline style   background-image: none;   so that is correct... Why the hell does it still show the background image....
[07:49:56] <the_kick> BillCriswell: lol, sharp
[07:50:53] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: Is the background image on a parent element? Add a background-color to the element.
[07:51:13] <BillCriswell> the_kick: It took all the brains I had today.
[07:52:41] <BillCriswell> saltcod: That's what I'd say it is I guess? Not really sure on the different between a function and a method but still.
[07:53:16] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, when i hide that div, the background is gone... So it's that div
[07:53:50] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: Do you have an image element in that div of the background image? It has to be something dumb.
[07:54:01] <saltcod> thanks BillCriswell: I'm methodically going through https://tutsplus.com/lesson/slides-and-structure/ to try and stop writing horrible spaghetti code
[07:54:43] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, yes it's a repeating (y) image as a background
[07:55:11] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: I would need a live example to help any more here.
[07:56:10] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, yes i understand
[08:00:09] <byob_> can anybody help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/NCNhL/
[08:00:29] <BillCriswell> byob_: There's no .onclick()
[08:00:55] <BillCriswell> You'd want .click(function(){}) or preferable .on('click', function(){});
[08:01:27] <byob_> BillCriswell:  like this $("#button-1").click(function(){         $("#div-2").hide(2000);
[08:01:39] <BillCriswell> byob_: That'll do.
[08:03:16] <byob_> BillCriswell:  thanks buddy
[08:03:20] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[08:03:30] <inad922> Whats the easiest way to grab an attribute from a list of matched elements and store it in an array?
[08:04:21] <BillCriswell> inad922: You'd probably want $.map()
[08:05:40] <inad922> BillCriswell: All right, thanks
[08:10:28] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, i found it.....
[08:10:38] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, !important on the div's background colr
[08:10:42] <Krambiorix> DAMN
[08:11:57] <hlve> I'm going insane :(
[08:12:09] <klawd> hlve: sup
[08:13:01] <byob_> mmm is not showing my second div when i press the second button
[08:13:17] <rmill> inad922: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/WZf6e/
[08:14:32] <BillCriswell> I wonder why the argument order for maps callbacks are different from jQuery.map() and .map().
[08:15:10] <systemfault> Because people don't like consistency... as it makes our job easier and more accessible..
[08:15:26] <BillCriswell> rmill: var ids = $('p').map(function(idx, el){ return el.id }); works as well
[08:15:31] <systemfault> The less accessible is our field, the more chance I'll keep my job
[08:15:41] <BillCriswell> systemfault: Haha, truth.
[08:15:45] <rmill> BillCriswell: ya
[08:17:31] <MeMReS> Site is broken in compatibility mode, any idea's on how to disable compatibility across all version of IE?
[08:19:16] <BillCriswell> MeMReS: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3803901/how-can-i-programmaticaly-disable-ie-compatibility-mode is the best thing I can find.
[08:19:27] <Brodingo> MeMReS <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" >
[08:20:20] <Brodingo> MeMReS this is usually better than random IRC channels: http://www.google.com/
[08:20:21] <inad922> thanks rmill
[08:21:00] <Wolf_22> If I wanted to assign a CSS width to an element, could it basically be done like so?:  $('element').css('width') = $('something_else').width();
[08:21:23] <BillCriswell> Wolf_22: No.
[08:21:38] <BillCriswell> $('element').css('width', $('something_else').width());
[08:21:47] <Vill> $("<your selector here>").contents().find("Foobar").
[08:21:50] <Brodingo> or just width
[08:21:51] <MeMReS> Looks like the problem is that in compatability mode $ is not defined, in my other scripts that are being loaded
[08:21:54] <Wolf_22> BillCriswell: Interesting. Thanks.
[08:21:55] <Brodingo> ?width
[08:21:58] <Vill> sorry, wrong winnd
[08:22:14] <Brodingo> stupid robots
[08:23:29] <rmill> inad922: a bit cleaner, http://jsfiddle.net/serio/WZf6e/ (as BillCriswell mentioned)
[08:23:55] <rmill> `api width
[08:23:56] <b-ot> rmill, .width(): Get the current computed width for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/width/
[08:24:01] <inad922> rmill: so I don't need the get in the end
[08:24:07] <inad922> I mean after map
[08:24:09] <Brodingo> b-ot oh hey
[08:24:27] <rmill> Brodingo: syntax is a bit different.
[08:24:36] <rmill> `api appendTo @ Brodingo
[08:24:36] <b-ot> Brodingo, .appendTo(): Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the end of the target. http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[08:24:45] <rmill> (but, it is faster)
[08:24:51] <Brodingo> you love your grave accents
[08:24:57] <rmill> s'true
[08:25:03] <Brodingo> s`true
[08:25:17] <rmill> heh, t'was nlogax who came up with that, actually.
[08:25:29] <rmill> So it wouldn't step on bot-t's toes.
[08:25:40] <Brodingo> im into it
[08:28:59] <the_kick> so if im writing a simple script, ive always done :
[08:28:59] <the_kick> $(document).ready(function){})
[08:29:13] <the_kick> but should i use this intead?
[08:29:20] <the_kick> (function($) {
[08:29:20] <the_kick>   //ii only nside here, $ == jQuery, it was passed as the first argument
[08:29:20] <the_kick> })(jQuery);
[08:29:53] <rmill> $(function(){});
[08:30:15] <rmill> the_kick: it's all the same, matter of preference, really.
[08:30:23] <the_kick> rmill: ok
[08:33:54] <sacrilicious> hello
[08:34:04] <sacrilicious> i've heard of jquery lightbox
[08:34:15] <sacrilicious> but i was wondering if there was something else i could use ?
[08:34:46] <sacrilicious> on click on a photo, it opens it in a zoomed version...
[08:36:51] <mikecmpbll> if I have a selector as such: $("form#new_incident #remind_opts"), and I want to expand it to include $("form#new_action #remind_opts"), what's the most terse way?
[08:37:12] <zoned> the most terse way? lol
[08:37:40] <bartmax> the_kick yet better you use [to protect undefined] : (function($, undefined) {})(jQuery);
[08:37:51] <mikecmpbll> indeed, the shortest, as opposed to $("form#new_incident #remind_opts, form#new_action #remind_opts")
[08:38:06] <systemfault> Leave the tagname out when you use an id...
[08:38:10] <systemfault> it doesn't make sense.
[08:38:23] <mikecmpbll> true!
[08:38:26] <bartmax> mikecmpbll: ids should be unique
[08:38:37] <Wolf_22> I have a div and inside this div, I have a textarea. The textarea is resizable via a tiny handle icon (you can expand, contract it, etc.) What I'm trying to do is resize the parent container div to be the width of the textarea + like 1 em or something (it's an aesthetic thing). How could one do this? Currently, I'm trying to use the "resize" event to change the dimensions of the textarea...
[08:38:39] <Wolf_22> ...resize, but it's not working like I thought it would...
[08:38:39] <bartmax> mikecmpbll: no need for anything else but the id on the selector
[08:38:48] <mikecmpbll> unique per site, or per page?
[08:38:54] <zoned> using IDs period doesn't make sense. CSS specificity is stupid. everything should just be a class, and that way specificity makes sense. more specific selector = higher specificity
[08:39:12] <mikecmpbll> i see.
[08:39:19] <bartmax> Wolf_22: just make the div width auto and padding-right: 1em. (no js required)
[08:40:06] <Wolf_22> bartmax: I'll give that try--I never thought this would be achieved with JUST css... But it might.
[08:40:12] <bartmax> mikecmpbll: per page, page as the whole response in a single browser tab
[08:40:41] <mikecmpbll> okay, gotcha.
[08:41:14] <AQEEL> hi channel
[08:42:59] <Wolf_22> bartmax: Okay, I can't use width:auto because I'm centering the parent div across the page using the dimensions via absolute positioning...
[08:43:18] <AQEEL> do not absolute everything
[08:43:42] <Wolf_22> AQEEL: Why?
[08:44:13] <AQEEL> body display table....body div display table cell....text alighn center...everything is in center
[08:44:43] <Wolf_22> AQUEEL: Sorry, I misread your comment... I'm not absolute'ing everything. Just the DIV I'm using to contain the textarea.
[08:45:08] <AQEEL> if you know your layout very well and good to show for client side then go ahead else....it will be difficult to manage
[08:46:03] <AQEEL> wolf what are you positioning ..
[08:46:04] <Wolf_22> I'm actually just trying to make the DIV the same width of the expandable textarea (it can be dragged to be resized using a grippie in the bottom-right corner). I can't use CSS alone in this because I'm centering that DIV with positioning and percentage widths...
[08:46:27] <AQEEL> using plugin?
[08:46:29] <Wolf_22> (The textarea is inside this DIV.)
[08:46:36] <Wolf_22> No. Just standard core.
[08:46:44] <theresajayne> can anyone help me i am having problems with an onclick event
[08:46:54] <AQEEL> ask ..
[08:47:11] <AQEEL> you got fiddle for it, Wolf_22
[08:47:31] <MeMReS> hmm I wonder does loading jquery from outside of the domain cause a problem for earlier versions of IE?
[08:47:34] <Wolf_22> AQUEEL: I'll try to whip one up.
[08:47:45] <AQEEL> ok
[08:48:02] <AQEEL> MeMReS: why?
[08:48:15] <theresajayne> i keep getting an error Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'value' of undefined  when all i am doing is onclick="editJob($(this))"
[08:48:38] <MeMReS> well I keep getting people using old version of IE, and when i use compatibility mode it cause $ to not be defined
[08:48:43] <theresajayne> editjob just currently does Alert("doing stuff");
[08:49:09] <theresajayne> this is on chrome and all other jquery and javascript is working
[08:49:09] <AQEEL> jquery will not work with compatibility mode
[08:49:38] <AQEEL> actually compatibility mode is more broken than original old ie versions
[08:50:13] <MeMReS> if jQuery won't work with compatibility mode what is the work around? the meta tag?
[08:50:21] <AQEEL> yes
[08:50:31] <theresajayne> so why is my onclick not working?
[08:50:32] <AQEEL> and do define the document in your html page
[08:50:49] <AQEEL> fiddle ??
[08:51:25] <AQEEL> is it not working only in ie or other browesrs too
[08:53:03] <halcyon1234> jqm: Are there any good style guides for error message positioning in mobile apps (ie: next to label, beneath input element, etc)?
[08:53:25] <AQEEL> orry jqm not my field yet
[08:53:50] <AQEEL> sorry*
[08:54:54] <gahieb> hiya. Is there someone who can help me select id's using :not?
[08:55:10] <rmill> :>
[08:55:12] <gahieb> the syntax is killing me so far heh heh
[08:55:25] <dotnetted> Hey all - I'm trying to have a jQuery dialog box open before an async blocking ajax request (to notify the user that the ajax request is about to start) - In firefox everything works as expected but Chrome displays the dialog after the ajax request has completed instead of before - Why might this be?
[08:55:26] <rmill> gahieb: What is that you want to do, exactly?
[08:56:17] <gahieb> The goal is to select all id's in a class except the one that is selected
[08:56:47] <gahieb> I have grabbed the variable of the selected id, and now want to choose all except that one
[08:57:07] <gahieb>          .mouseover(function() {
[08:57:07] <gahieb>             var idvar = this.id;
[08:57:07] <gahieb>             jQuery('#' + idvar).each(function() {
[08:57:07] <gahieb>                jQuery(this).css({opacity: 0.5});
[08:57:16] <Weems> pastebin
[08:57:46] <gahieb> or this
[08:57:46] <gahieb>       jQuery(".gridlayout").mouseover(function() {
[08:57:46] <gahieb>           var idvar = this.id;
[08:57:46] <gahieb>           jQuery('#' + idvar).css({opacity: 0.5});
[08:58:26] <gahieb> but have tired 15 different ways to use :not and so far no luck
[08:58:59] <NoiseEee> gahieb: don't paste code in channel
[08:59:14] <gahieb> yeah, I will likely be kicked for flooding
[08:59:48] <gahieb> should I go to forums instead?
[09:01:31] <AQEEL> use jsfiddle.net
[09:01:47] <gahieb> okey doke
[09:03:35] <karolyi> Chuck Norris doesnât need to use AJAX because pages are too afraid to postback anyways.
[09:04:20] <rindolf> karolyi: I don't get it.
[09:06:20] <dotnetted> http://jsfiddle.net/UtWst/ - Is there a way to get this jquery dialog to display before the sleep function? thanks
[09:07:25] <dotnetted> (without putting the sleep() in a callback function - the sleep() is actually a bunch of code with blocking ajax calls - the idea is to use the jquery dialog like a non-blocking alert())
[09:08:19] <AQEEL> what is it suppose to do...as of now it does not disappea itself
[09:08:38] <dotnetted> it's supposed to pop up before the execution of the sleep function
[09:09:01] <AQEEL> yeah and waits for interaction
[09:09:05] <dotnetted> In the real code it says 'Calculating Stuff...' and the code afterwards performs some ajax calls
[09:09:22] <dotnetted> the problem is that the dialog doesnt display until after the ajax calls have completed
[09:09:46] <dotnetted> the dialog does not need to receive any user interaction
[09:11:06] <dotnetted> It's really just a way to notify the the user that their browser is hanging (syncronous ajax calls) for a reason.
[09:11:10] <AQEEL> how are u handling your Ajax calls
[09:11:32] <NoiseEee>  dotnetted: you should rethink your approach.
[09:11:48] <dotnetted> I can't modify the ajax calls - it's wrapped in a CRM API wrapper (netsuite)
[09:12:38] <dotnetted> the call will always be synchronous - all I need to do is pop up a jquery dialog before it performs the call to explain why the browser is hanging heh
[09:13:02] <Weems> which could also hang
[09:13:34] <dotnetted> Weems: what would?
[09:27:53] <computer2000> offtopic do i need to download the whole sdk to get the windows mobile emulator?
[09:46:14] <Absolute0> is $.each asynchronous?
[09:47:21] <NoiseEee> uh no
[09:47:28] <NoiseEee> it iterates through things one at a time
[09:49:28] <Absolute0> NoiseEee: you're right: http://jsfiddle.net/4EPqG/ sorry for my laziness
[10:01:48] <frek818> Hello everyone.
[10:05:19] <pierrelechelle> Hey guys, I'm searching for a developer partner to create a lightweight WYSIWYG in html5 as a plugin for jQuery (paid for commercial use), I think it'll be very profitable, anyone is interested ?
[10:05:22] <frek818> Can anyone suggest the current best practice for submitting cross site ajax POST request using jquery
[10:05:43] <NoiseEee> frek818: sure, make sure the server you want to get data from offers CORS or jsonP otherwise you're SOL
[10:07:42] <frek818> jsonp is only good for get request. I'll have to read up on CORS. I never heard of it.
[10:08:05] <frek818> But I have control of the server.
[10:08:19] <frek818> It'll just be a django web app.
[10:08:55] <MistuhKurtz> pierrelechelle, there are a couple open source offerings that are pretty frickin' awesome
[10:08:57] <NoiseEee> frek818: so then you can implement CORS but keep security in mind
[10:09:06] <NoiseEee> of course its modern-browser required
[10:09:13] <frek818> I should say that I have full control over the site the the post request will be sent to. I have limited access to the server that will sending the requests
[10:09:37] <NoiseEee> yep thats fine frek818 thats where it counts
[10:09:39] <MistuhKurtz> and this would be your competition pierrelechelle: http://imperavi.com/redactor/
[10:10:45] <pierrelechelle> MistuhKurtz: Ouuh , I didn't knew this one :D
[10:11:02] <MistuhKurtz> looks nice, huh? for open source, here are two other nice looking ones:
[10:11:05] <MistuhKurtz> http://jejacks0n.github.com/mercury/
[10:11:07] <MistuhKurtz> http://xing.github.com/wysihtml5/
[10:11:20] <MistuhKurtz> here is an example of integrating bootstrap with wysihtml5: http://jhollingworth.github.com/bootstrap-wysihtml5/
[10:11:58] <dlam> i have .animate() call, and if i scroll the page like real quick, its callback dosent get fired, any idea what to check?
[10:12:07] <pierrelechelle> MistuhKurtz: Yeah, I'm actually using WYSIHTML5 but found it's functionnalities a bit limited
[10:13:00] <MistuhKurtz> what don't you like about it pierrelechelle ?
[10:13:23] <MistuhKurtz> and why not fork it and add in any features you need?
[10:14:27] <pierrelechelle> MistuhKurtz: I don't like it because it doesn't fit very well in my CakePHP app
[10:14:38] <MistuhKurtz> how do you mean?
[10:15:37] <pierrelechelle> MistuhKurtz: I need some kind of html workaround for the toolbar
[10:15:58] <MistuhKurtz> hold on let me look at how I did it in my zend framework app...
[10:16:45] <pierrelechelle> MistuhKurtz: But i kinda love the thing you've just gave me, Redactor !
[10:17:03] <MistuhKurtz> oh yeah, then by all means pay for a license
[10:17:44] <pierrelechelle> MistuhKurtz: I'm developing an Intranet for small business which will be paid so that's not a problem, and the licence is quite cheap with unlimited updates so...
[10:17:54] <AQEEL> ok what is the best approach for mouse down and help position
[10:18:13] <AQEEL> mouse is clicked and held..
[10:18:23] <MistuhKurtz> pierrelechelle, did you evaluate mercury editor?
[10:19:46] <pierrelechelle> MistuhKurtz: nop, but Redactor seems more "professionnal"
[10:20:15] <MistuhKurtz> yeah redactor seems like your best option, i was just interested if you had an opinion about it
[10:20:33] <pierrelechelle> MistuhKurtz: you develop it ? Seems very good tho
[10:20:41] <MistuhKurtz> oh no
[10:21:47] <nerk> hey all, I have a co-worker who is a non-web programmer (very talented java programmer), that is looking for some book recommendations for learning jquery,javascript,ajax.  anyone have a recommendation?
[10:22:22] <moimikey> nerk: http://addyosmani.com/blog/
[10:22:56] <rmill> and his list: https://plus.google.com/115133653231679625609/posts/H3onog42Msj
[10:23:39] <zoned> definitely learn javascript, then jquery
[10:24:40] <nerk> thx much
[10:24:59] <MistuhKurtz> what's a favorite video embed library?
[10:25:03] <MistuhKurtz> ya have one pierrelechelle ?
[10:25:50] <pierrelechelle> MistuhKurtz: Nop, but the HTML5 allows you to develop one very fast !
[10:27:56] <killtheliterate> how does one call a method after using append(). something like .append(function
[10:29:22] <Croves> Why this doesn't work in IE8+? http://pastebin.com/hJT3EYBk
[10:34:19] <zulu-gula> I have a question: I would like to hide wrapper if there is no checkboxes checked. Here is sample code: http://jsfiddle.net/vjTgf/1/
[10:35:58] <pierrelechelle> MistuhKurtz: I'm leaving, thanks for your help !
[10:56:04] <Absolute0> How can I .clone() with css?
[10:56:35] <BillCriswell> Absolute0: Say what?
[10:57:00] <Absolute0> $('#foo').clone looses all css
[10:57:08] <Absolute0> unless it's part of the style attribute
[10:57:18] <Absolute0> which only happens when jquery put it there
[10:58:11] <BillCriswell> Absolute0: You can't have two elements with the same id attribute. Either way, if your stylesheet has #foo { styles } in it, it will still carry over the styles.
[11:00:32] <Absolute0> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/4EPqG/2/
[11:00:41] <Absolute0> I'd like .bar to carry over all the css
[11:00:57] <Absolute0> I guess I should just have classes for my elementes...
[11:02:48] <NoiseEee> ...
[11:03:38] <Absolute0> I need to clone an element of my api's client and not require them to style the cloned element.
[11:06:09] <BillCriswell> Absolute0: http://jsfiddle.net/r6z48/ This should help explain what's going on. Apparently you can't check the color of it till it's applied to the document.
[11:07:27] <Absolute0> BillCriswell: the color is attained from the css class. What would happend if that class was lost after the clone?
[11:10:01] <BillCriswell> Absolute0: I see what you're saying now. Hmm..
[11:10:54] <Absolute0> screw it, I'll make the client do extra work by giving them extra instructions
[11:11:00] <BillCriswell> Absolute0: Haha.
[11:11:33] <BillCriswell> I wonder if you could get all the CSS properties into an object in any clever way.
[11:11:37] <Absolute0> I could just get the css prior to the clone (the ones I need), and then add them to the new element.
[11:12:58] <BillCriswell> Absolute0: True.
[11:13:27] <rindolf> sheilablackrose: hi.
[11:13:28] <BillCriswell> I'm just wondering if there's anything like $(el).getCSSProperties() or something out there somewhere haha
[11:13:33] <rindolf> sheilablackrose: any luck?
[11:17:06] <shoky> Absolute0 BillCriswell: the element won't "have" the css properties until it's actually in the DOM.  putting this in css:  .foo { ... }     doesn't mean  "any element with class foo". it means  "any element in the DOM, with class foo".  think of it like the document root is implicit in the css:   #document .foo { ... }
[11:17:27] <BillCriswell> shoky: I got that. 8-)
[11:17:28] <shoky> doesn't make sense for it to have that color: #222  utnil it's actually in the DOM
[11:22:44] <BillCriswell> shoky: Awesome explanation, though
[11:22:57] <BillCriswell> I could not have put it so simply.
[11:34:23] <Absolute0> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/r6z48/1/
[11:40:52] <shoky> Absolute0: yes?
[11:41:21] <shoky> it first logs an empty string, then it logs a black color. as expected, no?
[11:44:51] <Absolute0> shoky: the css wasn't cloned
[11:45:05] <shoky> Absolute0: css isn't cloned, css sits in the .css file
[11:45:12] <Absolute0> correct
[11:45:17] <shoky> Absolute0: the element was cloned, with the class it had
[11:45:39] <Absolute0> shoky: is there any way to get all the css into a local object?
[11:45:39] <shoky> Absolute0: you toggled the class off.. so of course the clone isn't red
[11:45:51] <shoky> all the css?
[11:45:59] <shoky> that's highly browser-dependant
[11:46:01] <shoky> meaning: no
[11:46:06] <Absolute0> {color:red;}
[11:46:14] <shoky> absolutely not
[11:46:27] <Absolute0> I really like your confidence. :)
[11:46:37] <shoky> there are hundreds of css properties..
[11:46:50] <shoky> each browser has their own shit too..
[11:47:46] <shoky> of course.. there's the native getComputedStyle()
[11:51:55] <DonLalo> hi guys
[11:54:21] <BillCriswell> Absolute0: If you know the exact properties you need you can use a simple .each() with .css()
[11:54:53] <DonLalo> i'm trying to debug something here http://bit.ly/YlKb7Y For some weird reason  the fancybox plugin won't launch. Everything is set up properly, and should work, console won't tell me anything and i'm kinda lost. If anyone could take a look it woud be awesome
[11:55:54] <DonLalo> the only weird thing i see on the console is : Resource interpreted as Document but transferred with MIME type image/jpeg
[11:56:10] <DonLalo> when i click the image that's supposed to fire up fancybox
[11:56:22] <BillCriswell> Where's that image exactly DonLalo?
[11:56:54] <DonLalo> BillCriswell: the small thumbnails after the content
[11:57:19] <amaroks> Hello, can't I do $('.className').fadeIn(500).html(newHTML); ?>
[11:58:13] <BillCriswell> DonLalo: I'm looking in the event listeners and there's a weird  a:not(' event.
[11:58:19] <shoky> amaroks: if you want the .html(..) to happen after the fade in completes, use the complete callback
[11:58:41] <shoky> amaroks:  $('.className').fadeIn(500, function() { $(this).html(newHTML) })
[11:59:07] <dan_js> I have a simple jump menu in jQuery mobile that I can't get to work correctly. All of the "pages" are in the same document, but only the higher up select menu seems to work correctly. I'm using each() so I thought it would be able to work on all of them. Can anybody take a look? http://westendmobile.konceptinteractive.com/#features http://westendmobile.konceptinteractive.com/#contact
[11:59:15] <DonLalo> BillCriswell: aha, haven't noticed that
[11:59:47] <DonLalo> BillCriswell: to be honest, I don't have a clue what is that, and how it got there
[12:01:14] <amaroks> shoky: I want the newHTML to fade
[12:01:29] <amaroks> the div already contains content, and want it to fadeIn showing the new content
[12:01:40] <shoky> amaroks: then why not put the .html before the .fadeIn
[12:01:52] <vinc386> Hi there, is it possible to assign an value to window.location.hash while the page gets unloaded using jquery IN MOBILE SAFARI?
[12:02:47] <dan_js> My theory is that it does work, but isn't grabbing the "value" variable in the second form for some reason.
[12:03:02] <amaroks> shoky: isn't working :(
[12:03:28] <amaroks> $('.mydiv').html(newContent).fadeIn(3000); shoky this doesnt fadeIn but just shows
[12:03:56] <shoky> does .mydiv  have display:none
[12:05:17] <amaroks> shoky: nope, it already has contents
[12:05:39] <amaroks> okay so I must hide the new contents first
[12:05:41] <shoky> so you want to fade-in a div that's already visible/
[12:05:49] <shoky> yap
[12:07:11] <dwarder> i use form mask validate plugin $("#you").mask("+9999-99-99");
[12:07:22] <dwarder> i want to be able to enter part of this
[12:07:43] <dwarder> i.e. +__12-_3_11
[12:08:06] <dwarder> as opposed to full number +1234-56-78
[12:08:12] <dwarder> is it possible?
[12:08:37] <amaroks> Thanks shoky
[12:10:05] <DonLalo_> BillCriswell: sorry, my connection went offline
[12:10:24] <BillCriswell> DonLalo: Not having much luck here finding that odd click event. What happens if you set type to 'image' in fancybox() options.
[12:11:06] <DonLalo_> BillCriswell: Let me try that!
[12:11:33] <BillCriswell> DonLalo_: That weird event listener is could also be the problem. I'd definitely see what the issue is there.
[12:12:24] <dan_js> Nevermind, I figured it out.
[12:13:10] <DonLalo_> BillCriswell: yeah, definteley. I'll try to look for that on the code
[12:15:06] <DonLalo_> BillCriswell: i'm trying to contact other person that did some coding on the site, maybe he knows about that weird listener
[12:15:16] <DonLalo_> BillCriswell: thanks for taking a look :)
[12:15:26] <BillCriswell> DonLalo_: No problem!
[12:40:35] <scar> if i want to "wait" for a specific div, #foo to "appear" (it may be generated in a modal window, ajax, who knows... is there a way for jquery to detect when it becomes visible?

[13:44:13] <Aero`> Hi guys :) !
[13:44:29] <Aero`> Got a little problem with an ajax POST request. Anyone got a minute to look it up ,
[13:44:31] <Aero`> ?
[13:45:15] <Guest21584> post something we can look at Aero`
[13:46:39] <Aero`> Allright. http://beta.aerodream-fr.net/admin/index.php?page=news Check the edit button for the news ("Modification" in french). It uses a wysihtml5 editor.
[13:46:53] <Aero`> I use a standard POST request to send to PHP the modified news
[13:47:07] <Aero`> but the AJAX request doesn't fire
[13:47:16] <Aero`> it is sent as a regular form
[13:47:45] <Aero`> and since action= and method= attributes aren't specified, the request is performed as a GET to index.php ...
[13:48:07] <Aero`> The fun thing is that it works perfectly if I disable the WYSIWIG editor and put a regular textarea instead
[13:48:09] <dokg> hi
[13:48:54] <dokg> how can I check the radio button $('input[name=test]') that has the class "yes" ?
[13:49:21] <shoky> dokg: $('input.yes[name=test]')
[13:49:32] <dokg> thank you:)
[13:50:14] <dokg> shoky, and to check that one I can do :  .attr('checked', true);    ?
[13:50:24] <shoky> dokg: .prop('checked', true)
[13:50:40] <dokg> shoky, what is the difference ? I've seen using attr() before
[13:51:22] <shoky> attr is for attributes (what you set on the html tags), prop is for live DOM-node properties
[13:52:08] <shoky> many attributes get copied to properties and vice versa
[13:52:21] <shoky> but properties is usually what you want to deal with
[13:52:43] <Aero`> @Guest21584 : No idea ?
[13:52:45] <shoky> even if older jquery and the browser might make it seem otherwise
[14:01:44] <shoky> Aero`: i think it's because of that bootstrap validation
[14:01:58] <shoky> Aero`: it's handling the submit too
[14:02:21] <Aero`> could you be a bit more specific ?
[14:03:20] <sheilablackrose> hi guys can anyone tell me why im getting a not defined eror?  $(function() {
[14:03:21] <sheilablackrose>             $('.documentCheckBox').click(documentTonglePanel);
[14:03:21] <sheilablackrose>         });
[14:03:21] <sheilablackrose>         function transactionTonglePanel()
[14:03:21] <sheilablackrose>         {
[14:03:21] <sheilablackrose>         }
[14:03:38] <Aero`> there's no bootstrap validation stuff applied to the textarea
[14:03:55] <Aero`> and if I don't turn the textarea in a wysiwig editor, it runs fine
[14:03:57] <Aero`> :s
[14:05:59] <NoiseEee> sheilablackrose: please NEVER paste code here.
[14:06:28] <NoiseEee> sheilablackrose: define the function first.
[14:07:22] <sheilablackrose> ok
[14:07:49] <shoky> Aero`: nevertheless it's coming from there. line 49 in bootstrap-valid.js is triggering the submit
[14:11:39] <sheilablackrose> still getting undefined
[14:12:31] <shoky> Aero`: i think you need to use the submit callbacks provided by that plugin
[14:13:50] <shoky> sheilablackrose:  you have 2 different function names there..
[14:14:07] <sheilablackrose> sorry let me check
[14:15:29] <sheilablackrose> shoky: actually my function documentTonglePanel is in a js file
[14:15:40] <sheilablackrose> is that why its trowing that error
[14:15:41] <sheilablackrose> ?
[14:15:55] <shoky> how would i know
[14:16:14] <sheilablackrose> how do i call a function from a js file?
[14:16:25] <shoky> :\
[14:16:30] <CrazyZurfer> Hi, I'm having problems with the popup... what I want is to open it and then close it after x seconds
[14:16:32] <shoky> same way you call any function
[14:16:45] <shoky> the js has to be included before
[14:16:52] <shoky> and the function has to be in an accessible scope
[14:16:52] <sheilablackrose> yup th ejs is included
[14:16:58] <shoky> if you dont understand that, go learn javascript
[14:17:02] <sheilablackrose> what do you mean accesible scolpe
[14:17:20] <shoky> if  documentTonglePanel is defined inside another function
[14:17:33] <shoky> then you cant access it directly from another place
[14:18:02] <goddard> if i am using the calander and it is todays date that is selected
[14:18:04] <goddard> it stays the same color either way
[14:18:09] <goddard> why doesn't it change color?
[14:18:32] <NoiseEee> sheilablackrose: you should probably learn a little JS
[14:18:43] <sheilablackrose> yup learning
[14:19:33] <sheilablackrose> th efunction is not in any other function. the js is just a collection of cuntion nothing calls another function
[14:19:50] <CrazyZurfer> I'm having problems with popups... what I want is to open it and then close it after x seconds, i'm trying this: but doesn't work: $('#Added').popup("open", { history: false, positionTo: 'window', overlayTheme: "a" }).delay(800).queue(function () { $(this).popup("close") });
[14:21:05] <CrazyZurfer> it's jquery mobile
[14:21:18] <CrazyZurfer> but for joining #jquerymobile it asks me to be invited
[14:21:40] <CrazyZurfer> and it redirected me here, so I'm asking here
[14:28:44] <shoky> CrazyZurfer: .queue(function(next) { $(this).popup("close"); next() });
[14:35:41] <sheilablackrose> when i inspect element i can c <script src="/Scripts/Tags.js"></script> which has the function but still i get the error undefined. any ideas?
[14:37:23] <CrazyZurfer> shoky, it works now, but popup options don't work :/
[14:39:07] <CrazyZurfer> shoky: any idea? :)
[14:41:49] <shoky> CrazyZurfer: i donno jqmobile, but those options look like initialization options, not arguments to the 'open' method
[14:43:41] <CrazyZurfer> shoky: but it seems to be right http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/pages/popup/methods.html
[14:44:16] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @CrazyZurfer
[14:44:25] <ryanneufeld> oh, no bot... boo
[14:44:57] <ryanneufeld> CrazyZurfer: do you have a demo? or a place we can see your code?
[14:45:08] <ryanneufeld> I've got some exp with jqm, and I've done popups
[14:46:15] <shoky> CrazyZurfer: i only see x,y,transition,positionTo
[14:46:26] <shoky> no history,overlayTheme
[14:46:51] <Doddlin> hi all!
[14:47:03] <Doddlin> Would someone please take a quick look on http://pastebin.com/xuvSipSN
[14:47:11] <Doddlin> I just can't see what's wrong?
[14:48:38] <ryanneufeld> Doddlin: well, you haven't asked a question
[14:48:44] <ryanneufeld> Doddlin: start with that :)
[14:48:48] <CrazyZurfer> ryanneulfeld: http://beta.musigamia.com/  search for anything, like eminem, then click on a song from the list
[14:49:03] <Doddlin> ryanneufeld, It doesn't do anything, at all..
[14:49:03] <Doddlin> .
[14:49:06] <Doddlin> :P
[14:49:19] <ryanneufeld> Doddlin: that's not a question :p
[14:49:28] <Doddlin> Why is it not working? ;=)
[14:49:43] <ryanneufeld> Doddlin: not enough information in your pastie to tell that
[14:49:47] <peitschie> hi everyone :)
[14:49:56] <ryanneufeld> Doddlin: can you replicate the problem in jsfiddle.net ?
[14:50:01] <ryanneufeld> CrazyZurfer: I'm looking
[14:50:08] <Doddlin> I might, hold 1 min :)
[14:50:31] <ryanneufeld> CrazyZurfer: I see the popup
[14:50:37] <ryanneufeld> CrazyZurfer: and then it fades
[14:51:10] <CrazyZurfer> rryanneufeld: that's the idea, but what about the options  like overlayTheme: "a"
[14:51:21] <ryanneufeld> right, I see the a: theme
[14:51:26] <ryanneufeld> pure white
[14:51:35] <ryanneufeld> isn't that the a theme?
[14:52:21] <CrazyZurfer> yep, but by overlay it means to put the rest of the content in another color
[14:52:57] <ryanneufeld> http://beta.musigamia.com/style/jquery.mobile-1.1.0.min.css is 404
[14:53:36] <ryanneufeld> CrazyZurfer: also you can use 1.2 now
[14:54:22] <ryanneufeld> CrazyZurfer: you need 1.2 in order to use popup
[14:55:25] <ryanneufeld> Oh, CrazyZurfer looks your search page isn't using the same code as your main page, the header is different
[14:56:31] <CrazyZurfer> yup
[14:57:26] <CrazyZurfer> that's because I wanted to share the search, for example, giving a friend look at moby --> http://beta.musigamia.com/search.php?buscar=moby
[14:57:49] <Doddlin> jsfiddle is really slow? :S
[14:58:01] <CrazyZurfer> if I dont add the headers it would broke
[15:00:11] <CrazyZurfer> ryanneufeld: I updated the header and still not working
[15:00:24] <Doddlin> ryanneufeld: here it is: http://jsfiddle.net/gG7mE/1/
[15:03:57] <CrazyZurfer> ryanneufeld: updated the file, now they've the same headers. Not working :(
[15:04:06] <ryanneufeld> CrazyZurfer: hmm
[15:04:08] <ryanneufeld> that is odd
[15:07:24] <blink465> anyone knows how to make this so when the textarea is empty it would return false when clicking the submit button but it needs to work for everytextare depening what the person is choosing
[15:07:37] <blink465> i have the jsfddle http://jsfiddle.net/qT7Dc/
[15:08:09] <tw2113> fiddle fiddle fiddle
[15:08:10] <CrazyZurfer> ryanneufeld: fixed, added those options in the HTML and not in the js, I wanted to do it with js, but doesn't matter :P
[15:08:31] <ryanneufeld> CrazyZurfer: are you creating the html with js?
[15:08:41] <CrazyZurfer> nope
[15:09:21] <CrazyZurfer> before: <div data-role="popup" id="Added"> after: <div data-role="popup" id="Added" data-overlay-theme="a">
[15:09:42] <CrazyZurfer> just added the data-overlay-theme="a" in the html instead of the js
[15:09:49] <ryanneufeld> CrazyZurfer: ah, so the popup existed in the page before you showed it?
[15:10:03] <CrazyZurfer> yup
[15:10:58] <ryanneufeld> Ahh that's why
[15:11:11] <ryanneufeld> Doddlin: so, you need to use a document ready
[15:11:48] <lanken> I'm having an issue with .draggable in jQuery UI
[15:12:01] <ryanneufeld> Doddlin: http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[15:12:29] <lanken> I'm using helper: "clone" , and the helper is consistently the wrong size -- slightly larger, around 5% compared to the original.
[15:13:14] <lanken> page is here -- http://vps.zglen.com:3000/squares/30003/show_area?r=7
[15:15:38] <ryanneufeld> Doddlin: http://jsfiddle.net/gG7mE/2/
[15:16:14] <ryanneufeld> Doddlin: note that the .stop() prevents the animations from 'adding up' if you hover on/off too quickly
[15:30:57] <warrior_> Hi everyone
[15:31:36] <warrior_> this is my first time in this room :) so i hope i dont break any rules
[15:32:26] <warrior_> is there any one can help me about dragging and dropping with jquery ui
[15:33:03] <anew> u already broke a rule
[15:33:18] <warrior_> sorry
[15:33:22] <warrior_> :)
[15:33:50] <lanken> I managed to fix the draggable clone size problem by stripping out some other DOM elements, including the resizeable window that the map lives in
[15:34:06] <lanken> I'll see if I can put them back without breaking it again.
[15:34:16] <Doddlin> ryanneufeld, that seems to work, but why can't i hide it?
[15:34:40] <ryanneufeld> you can't animate visibiilty
[15:34:43] <ryanneufeld> not like that
[15:34:48] <ryanneufeld> I think
[15:34:54] <ryanneufeld> I'm not an expert with animate
[15:34:55] <lanken> working version is here
[15:34:56] <lanken> http://vps.zglen.com:3000/squares/30003/show_area_2?r=7
[15:35:06] <ryanneufeld> Doddlin: try show() and hide()
[15:35:11] <lanken> but it may break as I change it.
[15:36:51] <warrior_> Ok i dont know the rules is there any where i can read them before asking questions
[15:40:31] <warrior_> Actually my  problem is i connected 2 tables one is draggable the other  is sortable i move and drop in to sortable everthing great but i want to append to row something different than i dragged
[15:41:30] <warrior_> i read about two days about everything i can find before asking here
[15:42:42] <ryanneufeld> warrior_: /topoc
[15:42:47] <ryanneufeld> warrior_: /topic
[15:43:58] <bricker> I'm trying to clone an element, empty it, fill it up, and then replace the original element with the clone, so that there is barely any noticeable "blip". I'm trying `clone = $(el).clone().empty(); clone.append
[15:44:03] <bricker> oops
[15:44:15] <bricker> clone.append "Something"; $(el).replaceWith clone;`
[15:44:37] <bricker> but it's just not updating. I'll jsfiddle if it sounds like it should be
[15:44:48] <Doddlin> yaaay, almost working!
[15:45:25] <Doddlin> it starts fading a bit below, i'd like to have it like "folding" in but that's for another evening
[15:45:29] <Doddlin> now, bedtime
[15:45:33] <Doddlin> thanks a bunch! :)
[15:47:44] <sheilablackrose> hi whats the syntax to check a checkbox ?  $('.documentCheckBox').attr('checked'); ?
[15:48:48] <bricker> sheilablackrose: you can use .is(":checked"), but compatibility is iffy
[15:48:54] <warrior_> ryanneufeld: i drag <tr> from one table to other after i move i want to append something different than i dragged
[15:48:59] <ryanneufeld> sheilablackrose: see .prop
[15:49:05] <ryanneufeld> `prop
[15:49:10] <sheilablackrose> which is th egood method
[15:49:25] <warrior_> but one table is draggable other is sortable
[15:49:42] <sheilablackrose> prop or ischecked
[15:50:08] <sheilablackrose> or  $("#documents input[type='checkbox']").addAttr('checked');
[15:50:16] <ryanneufeld> ?prop
[15:50:42] <ryanneufeld> sheilablackrose: look here: http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[15:51:07] <ryanneufeld> warrior_: then you can use the various methods for droppables to do that
[15:51:10] <warrior_> so i did something like this $("#playlist_now tbody").sortable({   revert: true,  receive:function () {  toastr.error('Listenizin silme iÅlemi baÅarÄ±yla gerÃ§ekleÅtirildi', 'Listeye GÃ¶nderildi', toastr.options.positionClass = 'toast-top-right', toastr.options.timeOut = '3600');},  opacity: 0.8, cursor: 'move', update: function() { var order = $(this).sortable("serialize") + '&update=update'; $.post("lib/class_updateList.php", 
[15:51:22] <sheilablackrose> tq
[15:51:24] <peitschie> is dave methvin around here?
[15:51:29] <ryanneufeld> warrior_: please use jsfiddle, or pastie
[15:51:33] <ryanneufeld> peitschie: no
[15:51:34] <ryanneufeld> he's not
[15:51:53] <warrior_> sorry
[15:52:03] <warrior_> $("#playlist_now tbody").sortable({   revert: true,  receive:function () { },  opacity: 0.8, cursor: 'move', update: function() { var order = $(this).sortable("serialize") + '&update=update'; $.post("lib/class_updateList.php", order, function(){   }); $('#playlist tbody tr').filter('.uygun').draggable({             connectToSortable: '#playlist_now tbody',             helper: 'clone',             revert: 'invalid'         });
[15:52:10] <peitschie> ryanneufeld: cool.  Thanks :). I was just wondering as we are currently chatting on a trac bugâ¦ thought potentially it would be faster in here :)
[15:52:19] <warrior_> in here in side recive function
[15:52:29] <ryanneufeld> warrior_: yet again, please use a pastie service or jsfiddle
[15:52:36] <warrior_> when i try to append
[15:52:45] <ryanneufeld> ?pe @ warrior_
[15:53:23] <warrior_> i am sorry. i am a newbie. ok i will make one in jsfiddle thanks

[16:04:42] <warrior_> here first table is draggable
[16:04:51] <warrior_> second is sortable and droppable
[16:05:06] <warrior_> when i drag from first table to another
[16:05:31] <warrior_> i want to append the tr i moved something new
[16:06:13] <sheilablackrose> nice

[16:08:44] <warrior_> @ryanneufeld now i am gonna try again
[16:17:08] <sheilablackrose> if i store an id in a variable myid. to access it do i need to do this $("'#'+myid")
[16:17:12] <sheilablackrose> doesnt seem right
[16:19:04] <warrior_> thanks again ryanneufeld i will try a few hours. i hope i can succeed
[16:19:54] <ryanneufeld> warrior_: good luck
[16:20:03] <ryanneufeld> warrior_: I have a demo fiddle, lemme find it
[16:20:05] <ryanneufeld> it might help you
[16:22:54] <sheilablackrose> how do i address an element id using a variable
[16:23:51] <ryanneufeld> sheilablackrose: you mean something like var someThing = $('#someId') ?
[16:24:27] <sheilablackrose> yup
[16:24:34] <sheilablackrose> i stored my id in var myid
[16:25:13] <sheilablackrose> so how do i retrive it $('#'+myid)?
[16:25:25] <ryanneufeld> like that
[16:25:59] <ryanneufeld> unless you have the # at the beginning of myid, then you just do $(myid)
[16:26:35] <sheilablackrose> so i would do this? var myid = 1; $('#'+myid).val() = something
[16:26:38] <sheilablackrose> like that
[16:26:39] <sheilablackrose> ?
[16:27:09] <sheilablackrose> so it would mean $('#1').val() = 1 right
[16:27:26] <naqutramas> Hey, does anyone know a support channel for kendo ui?
[16:29:37] <ryanneufeld> sheilablackrose: wait, what?
[16:29:42] <naqutramas> I'll take that as a no?
[16:29:53] <sheilablackrose> ok like this
[16:29:58] <sheilablackrose> i have 3 checkbox id 1,2,3
[16:30:01] <ryanneufeld> ?g kendoui irc @ naqutramas
[16:30:03] <b-ot> naqutramas
[16:30:08] <sheilablackrose> i store them in a vairable my id
[16:30:14] <sheilablackrose> spo if i want to access the firts one
[16:30:18] <sheilablackrose> var myid = 1;
[16:30:33] <sheilablackrose> so $('#'+myid)
[16:30:36] <sheilablackrose> is that right?
[16:30:43] <coldhead> oh god sheilablackrose
[16:30:44] <ryanneufeld> `tias
[16:30:47] <coldhead> you're still going at this
[16:31:11] <ryanneufeld> `tias
[16:31:18] <sheilablackrose> wrong?
[16:31:29] <twisted`> the current code: http://pastebin.com/2pSR9srq doesn't work when I click on the div itself
[16:31:30] <awc737> is it possible to only load a div from an iframe?
[16:31:35] <sheilablackrose> coldhead its an upgraded version
[16:31:36] <twisted`> it does work if I call the function from the Console. Any ideas why?
[16:31:38] <sheilablackrose> my codes evolving
[16:31:41] <ryanneufeld> `tias'
[16:31:53] <coldhead> oh good work sheilablackrose
[16:31:58] <coldhead> i hope it all works out great fo ryou
[16:31:58] <ryanneufeld> B-OT Y U NO WORK
[16:31:59] <b-ot> (å±®'Ð')å±®
[16:32:31] <naqutramas> My guess there isn't a kendo or telerik channel
[16:32:32] <awc737> B-OT u suck
[16:33:22] <awc737> is it possible to only load a div from an iframe?
[16:33:53] <sheilablackrose> thank you
[16:33:59] <danheberden> awc737: you might want to be a wee bit more detailed in that question
[16:34:01] <sheilablackrose> its going abit slow but im mobving forward
[16:34:29] <awc737> danheberden instead of loading iframe src="domain.tld", load one div element from domain.tld
[16:35:14] <danheberden> you would have to get the html via an ajax request, get just the div, and then put that in the iframe - me thinks
[16:35:24] <danheberden> assuming it's on the same domain
[16:35:30] <awc737> no different domain
[16:35:35] <danheberden> otherwise you'll be hitting the cross-domain policy
[16:35:54] <awc737> that seems odd though, because I can't imagine any security threats here
[16:36:02] <awc737> i can load the entire site into my iframe... why not a piece of it
[16:37:20] <coldhead> iframes load html pages, not fragments of pages
[16:37:36] <coldhead> if you just want to load a bit of a page use load() and no iframe
[16:37:47] <twisted`> someone? I got no clue why it wouldn't work
[16:37:51] <awc737> coldhead, and that would not violate cross-domain policy?
[16:38:32] <coldhead> twisted`: click(hideMenu()); should be click(hideMenu);
[16:38:48] <coldhead> you want to pass the function to click(), not call it immediately and pass what it returns to click
[16:38:58] <coldhead> esp. as it returns nothing
[16:39:07] <twisted`> coldhead: let me try :)
[16:39:13] <coldhead> good luck buddy
[16:39:53] <twisted`> coldhead: still not... hmm
[16:40:06] <coldhead> paste again, twisted`
[16:40:13] <awc737> coldhead that is not working:Â 		$("div#toolsEgress").load('external.tld #right *');
[16:40:14] <coldhead> or better yet, working demo at jsfiddle
[16:40:18] <awc737> is that breaking cross-domain policy?
[16:40:28] <coldhead> it sure is, awc737
[16:40:29] <twisted`> updated the code to reflect the change :)
[16:40:32] <coldhead> can you use a proxy?
[16:40:45] <twisted`> hmm well I can also just use an onclick="javascript:hideMenu()" in the html
[16:40:50] <coldhead> okay twisted`
[16:40:54] <awc737> I don't know about proxy's
[16:41:03] <coldhead> move the click() lines into the .ready() at the top
[16:41:19] <coldhead> otherwise they might run before those elements are in the page
[16:42:10] <ryanneufeld> sheilablackrose: can you paste a fiddle of the problem you're trying to solve?
[17:06:11] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's all take 5
[17:07:17] <digitalmediaguy> I am having a problem where a function works the first timeâ¦ then becomes undefined afterâ¦ I cannot figure out why?
[17:07:40] <MistuhKurtz> funky
[17:07:55] <digitalmediaguy> I saw some thing about possibly using a function call instead of a function reference?
[17:08:14] <coldhead> can we see the code?
[17:08:17] <yogurt_truck> digitalmediaguy: are you gonna show us the code
[17:08:23] <coldhead> because it's working fine in my imagination
[17:08:40] <coldhead> although i don't like the font
[17:09:03] <whiteoracles> Hello.
[17:09:14] <coldhead> gday whiteoracles
[17:09:38] <whiteoracles> Is there any way to allow a single accordion structure to have more than one element simultaneously open?
[17:10:39] <digitalmediaguy> http://pastebin.com/Fpw6UVzz
[17:11:06] <digitalmediaguy> So it alerts the first part fineâ¦. but the function always comes up undefined
[17:11:41] <whiteoracles> The idea is to query a DB and have all the results returned as collapsible nodes that default to being open.
[17:12:11] <whiteoracles> I'm a bit new to this, so I apologize if it's a dumb question.
[17:13:01] <digitalmediaguy> Am I doing something blatantly wrong?
[17:13:14] <coldhead> digitalmediaguy: http://pastebin.com/FyaUr5vy
[17:17:31] <digitalmediaguy> Thanks coldheadâ¦ So it alerts on pageloadâ¦ then when I click the button which btw is just onClick with the function name in a simple a tag
[17:17:48] <digitalmediaguy> it's undefined  :-/
[17:17:49] <coldhead> don't yse onclick
[17:17:52] <coldhead> use*
[17:18:01] <coldhead> that's from the 90s
[17:18:15] <digitalmediaguy> lolâ¦ ok.. how should I do it properly?
[17:18:18] <coldhead> give that button an id
[17:18:23] <digitalmediaguy> have a selectorâ¦ or
[17:18:25] <digitalmediaguy> ok
[17:18:28] <coldhead> and then do $('#id').click(clipIt);
[17:18:39] <digitalmediaguy> okâ¦ one sec!â¦ thanks
[17:18:49] <coldhead> good luck
[17:21:47] <md_5> Say I have an element <div><a>Foo</a>Bar</div>, how can I get only Bar?
[17:21:54] <yogurt_truck> element.onclick and grunge are two 90s things that refuse to die
[17:22:26] <coldhead> $('div').clone().remove('*').text()
[17:25:27] <digitalmediaguy> http://pastebin.com/R0bNmHK8
[17:26:39] <coldhead> digitalmediaguy: you need to bind that click() handler inside the same jQuery(function($){
[17:26:48] <coldhead> so just under the .load() bit i guess
[17:27:00] <coldhead> functions defined within that function aren't visible outside that function
[17:27:11] <coldhead> so you have to bind it where you defined it
[17:29:17] <digitalmediaguy> Thanksâ¦ like this? http://pastebin.com/NVpWgtVg
[17:29:28] <digitalmediaguy> Cause I tried that and I get the same result
[17:31:02] <yogurt_truck> coldhead: no he doesn't
[17:31:16] <yogurt_truck> you must be doing something else wrong, digitalmediaguy
[17:32:07] <coldhead> no he doesn't
[17:32:11] <yogurt_truck> some other code or markup you're not showing us
[17:34:19] <yogurt_truck> cause javascript scoping isn't the issue. it's some other dark secret corrupt mistake you're making
[17:34:24] <yogurt_truck> a mistake that will tear us all apart
[17:35:24] <digitalmediaguy> in my view (joomla) I have a simple link with the id clip_it and then that code I gave you
[17:35:46] <digitalmediaguy> it's def acting weirdâ¦ and yes joomla has other jquery on the page
[17:37:04] <yogurt_truck> digitalmediaguy: link to the live site?
[17:37:19] <coldhead> oh sweet zombie jesus joomla
[17:37:21] <yogurt_truck> or put the whole markup for your joomla view, and the actual js on jsfiddle or something
[17:37:39] <yogurt_truck> and yes, joomla
[17:40:14] <yogurt_truck> joomla is a big bloated truck of nightmares that runs over kittens in an infinite loop
[17:40:47] <digitalmediaguy> OH godâ¦ I am retardedâ¦ :P I had an id on the linkâ¦ and there were multiple items on the pageâ¦ I changed it to a classâ¦ and all is working FML
[17:40:49] <digitalmediaguy> sorry guys
[17:41:38] <snover> you canât be that retarded if you figured out on your own that you are retarded
[17:42:33] <tw2113> self aware retardation?
[17:42:45] <tw2113> seems legit
[17:42:48] <MistuhKurtz> i am aware that i am retarded, and i am retarded because i am aware
[17:42:54] <digitalmediaguy> Here is a twistâ¦ That link is within a masonry "item"â¦ when it's clicked I wish to unset that itemâ¦ and reload masonry? anyone done that?
[17:43:30] <danheberden> THE PLOT THICKENS
[17:43:37] <digitalmediaguy> LOL
[17:43:54] <digitalmediaguy> as nice as alerting 9999999 isâ¦ I thought maybe it should do something more!
[17:44:39] <yogurt_truck> masonry? more like FREEmasonry
[17:44:53] <yogurt_truck> which means you're hosting a freemasonry site on joomla
[17:44:55] <yogurt_truck> jesus christ
[17:45:07] <digitalmediaguy> what? :-/
[17:45:22] <digitalmediaguy> it's for a client
[17:46:30] <digitalmediaguy> So I need my link to run that function clipItâ¦ and have the function select the parent div with a class of itemâ¦ and then remove it / refresh with masonry
[17:46:40] <digitalmediaguy> I think?
[17:46:55] <coldhead> true and accepted scottish rite freemason client?
[17:47:00] <coldhead> those guys are $$
[17:47:39] <happyface> anyone know why $.blur(...) isn't triggering but $.on("blur", ...) is? I thought they were the same thing
[17:48:36] <MistuhKurtz> idk what $.blur does or is supposed to do, the other way is how you bind an event.
[17:48:42] <MistuhKurtz> an event handler*
[17:48:56] <happyface> http://api.jquery.com/blur/
[17:50:41] <happyface> I meant focus not blur, if that makes a difference. Oh, and the div I'm calling it on starts display:none
[17:52:10] <yogurt_truck> happyface: you sure the element is loaded by the time you call .blur on it?
[17:56:13] <happyface> yogurt_truck, actually it seems to work fine - I swear it didn't before. .blur is literally just calling .on(blur,) right?
[17:57:39] <coachz> hi, i'm confused about returning JSON data from php to ajax.  For simple status info I return { "success" : "message"} but what do I return if I have a key value json array too ?
[17:58:40] <yogurt_truck> happyface: I don't think so, but I haven't seen the code. It's supposedly a shortcut for .bind, not .on, which work differently, which is why I asked about the element being loaded, because .on does delegation and .bind doesn't
[17:58:57] <MistuhKurtz> coachz,  [{ "a" : "value1"}, {"b" : "value2"}]
[17:59:18] <yogurt_truck> (and I phrased the last part of that improperly, but hopefully you get the point)
[17:59:21] <Jon47> coachz: two things: json_decode function, and consider reporting the STATUS of the response throuugh HTTP status codes
[17:59:23] <coachz> but how does my ajax know success or fail then
[17:59:32] <coldhead> {"status": "success", "message": "no fatties", "data": ["foo", "aids", "lol"]}
[17:59:32] <MistuhKurtz> coachz, working in PHP json_encode should convert an array or an object into the appropriate JSON
[17:59:38] <happyface> yogurt_truck, that must be it then! I didn't realize .on delegated, that sounds very performance heavy
[18:00:03] <coldhead> performance doesn't really matter because people only ever visit facebook anyway
[18:00:12] <tw2113> tru that
[18:00:19] <coachz> how do i append my array to that coldhead?
[18:00:41] <tw2113> facebook?which is apparently going to start doing video ads in user feeds
[18:00:46] <tw2113> auto-playing
[18:00:57] <Jon47> uf
[18:01:03] <coldhead> the array in data?
[18:01:08] <coldhead> data: []?
[18:01:11] <coldhead> that's not array enough?
[18:01:20] <tw2113> [[]]
[18:01:25] <tw2113> arrays in your arrays
[18:01:34] <yogurt_truck> happyface: actually .on has several signatures and depending on the one you use when calling it it will do a direct binding or a delegated-style one
[18:01:35] <coldhead> oh snap
[18:01:50] <coachz> after no fatties
[18:02:12] <coachz> how do i put the array there as the third value key
[18:02:30] <happyface> yogurt_truck, very cool I didn't know that, thanks for the info
[18:03:14] <coldhead> coachz: if you have $aids->data = array('foo', 'aids', 'whatever') then it will automatically be handled when you do json_encode($aids)
[18:03:36] * tw2113 throws caramel popcorn at coldhead 
[18:04:06] <coachz> and is it hard to loop through the array values like that in jquery ?
[18:04:28] <coldhead> no
[18:04:32] <tw2113> ?each
[18:05:01] <tw2113> *taps foot*
[18:05:15] <yogurt_truck> sorry I sent the bot to get me a coffee
[18:05:27] <tw2113> i better bring enough for us all
[18:05:29] <tw2113> it
[18:05:44] <coachz> so on the ajax side the data is returned as a javascript object if datatype is json
[18:06:33] <coachz> how would i loop through the data array if it was key value pairs in that format
[18:07:16] <yogurt_truck> coachz: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in
[18:08:08] <yogurt_truck> or Object.keys(foo).forEach(...) if you're feeling ES5-y
[18:08:14] <coachz> i thought you used .eachin jquery
[18:08:21] <yogurt_truck> ah, right
[18:08:22] <yogurt_truck> jquery
[18:08:49] <MistuhKurtz> what's a jquery?
[18:08:58] * yogurt_truck tends to forget which channel he's in
[18:09:16] <tw2113> wanna know something fun coldhead ?
[18:09:21] <coldhead> i sure do
[18:09:40] <tw2113> getting asked to debug some google analytics stuff, something i had never done before
[18:09:51] <tw2113> only to find out the client didn't know where to check for the click results
[18:10:17] <yogurt_truck> you've just made me spill ice tea out of my nose
[18:10:30] <coldhead> fun!
[18:10:52] <coachz> how would you loop through this if data were key value pairs instead?    {"status": "success", "message": "no fatties", "data": ["foo", "aids", "lol"]}
[18:10:54] * tw2113 just got 500 points for that iced tea splattering
[18:11:36] <yogurt_truck> coachz: those _are_ key value pairs
[18:11:37] <coachz> mmmm iced tea
[18:11:51] <coachz> i mean inside data
[18:12:03] <yogurt_truck> ah
[18:12:04] <yogurt_truck> that's just an array
[18:12:18] <yogurt_truck> so loop it, like you'd loop an array
[18:12:19] <coachz> foo aids and lol.    if instead those were key value pairs
[18:12:41] <yogurt_truck> if data was ab object, you mean?
[18:12:54] <coachz> yes
[18:12:58] <yogurt_truck> you loop it, like I said before
[18:13:09] <tw2113> var mydata = {"status": "success", "message": "no fatties", "data": ["foo", "aids", "lol"]}
[18:13:20] <yogurt_truck> or, like you said jquery did with its own helper methods or whatever
[18:13:30] <tw2113> $.each(mydata['data'], function() { });
[18:13:35] <coachz> because .ajax returns a javascript object with datatype json
[18:14:09] <yogurt_truck> coachz: it's still a plain javascript object once you get it, nothing jquery-specific about it
[18:14:42] <coachz> ok thanks, sounds easy
[18:29:09] <oojacoboo> if you're doing a list with a bunch of repeated action links, how would you identify their action?
[18:29:21] <oojacoboo> would you use a class, something like rel, or what?
[18:29:37] <oojacoboo> provided that it's an ajax ui and the href wouldn't work
[18:50:01] <coldhead> what is ricki lake doing these days
[18:50:56] <tw2113> i heard she married and renamed to River
[18:51:22] <tw2113> she goes by River Lake now
[18:51:31] <tw2113> but i wouldn't hold me as accurate gossip
[18:52:47] <coldhead> it FEELS true
[18:57:48] <coldhead> apparently she's doing her talk show again
[19:04:26] <tw2113> and again no one will watch
[19:05:58] <coldhead> i use to watch the old one
[19:06:09] <tw2113> *documents coldhead*
[19:06:17] <coldhead> and i still wear my "girlfriend he's just using you" tshirt
[19:21:03] <aqeel> hi channel
[19:21:22] <wroathe> Speaking on behalf of the entire channel: Go away.
[19:21:31] <aqeel> ??
[19:21:31] <sheilablackrose> hi aqeel
[19:21:42] <aqeel> who to go away
[19:21:49] <aqeel> wroathe:
[19:27:18] <aqeel> http://jailbreak.webege.com/js/plugins/aautoscroll.js
[19:28:09] <aqeel> i would like to add a method edgescroll: where if the scroll encounters the edge it will autoscroll() in reverse ddirection
[19:29:16] <aqeel> but what i eould like to know is, is it better to add into the plugin or create outside of plugin and make use of existing methods... to obtain the desired function
[19:29:43] <aqeel> if it could be part of plugin would be better..
[19:30:12] <happyface> why would I be getting a HTMLFormElement instead of the actual html when calling for a DOM element?
[19:31:41] <aqeel> what is your code?
[19:31:54] <aqeel> how are you calling your element
[19:35:43] <happyface> aqeel, just $("#id")
[19:36:35] <coldhead> how do people get anything done in mootools
[19:36:36] <coldhead> :(
[19:36:57] <aqeel> hey coldhead mootools?
[19:36:57] <tw2113> cows!
[19:37:32] <aqeel> happyface: and this id is not your form id right
[19:37:50] <happyface> aqeel, yeah, my form id
[19:37:56] <Foxhoundz> hello jQ
[19:38:04] <Foxhoundz> I have come to assist and be assisted
[19:38:33] <aqeel> then that is true...why would I be getting a HTMLFormElement instead of the actual html when calling for a DOM element?...it is your form ID
[19:39:22] <aqeel> Foxhoundz: what assistance would you like to provide and be provided..
[19:39:23] <wilornel> mootools is like an IDE?
[19:39:31] <sheilablackrose> is there away to add an ajax option
[19:39:32] <sheilablackrose> ?
[19:40:02] <coldhead> mootools is a JS lib like jquery except much harder to work with
[19:40:05] <aqeel> away to add ajax, may be not possible it is "AWAY"
[19:40:08] <wilornel> ahh I see
[19:40:09] <wilornel> is it good?
[19:40:15] <coldhead> it's rubbish
[19:40:15] <enderx86> Let's say I have a button that opens a popup window. That popup creates a JSON from user input. Is it possible to "return" that JSON back to the parent window?
[19:40:32] <wilornel> What is so hard to do in there?
[19:40:55] <happyface> aqeel, usually you just get the DOM object, not another object
[19:41:04] <coldhead> selecting, chaining, dom manipulation, property manipulation, animations
[19:41:15] <coldhead> haven't tried AJAX yet but that is gonna hurt too i expect
[19:41:41] <sheilablackrose> or is there an option like updatetargetId?
[19:41:45] <aqeel> but you said your self, it is is on your form...may be you have multiple same ids
[19:42:53] <Foxhoundz> I currently require no assistance, at least not with jQ, but I'm willing assist!
[19:43:16] <enderx86> Anyone know the answer to my question?
[19:43:26] <enderx86> Whether a popup window can return a variable to its parent window/
[19:44:30] <wilornel> mootools works with classes, I see
[19:45:54] <sheilablackrose> is there a function to update or refresh a div
[19:45:55] <sheilablackrose> ?
[19:45:59] <sheilablackrose> on my ajax post
[19:46:08] <wilornel> refresh a div??
[19:47:01] <happyface> aqeel, no, if you have multiple ids it just gets the first one
[19:47:14] <sheilablackrose> like ajaxoptions() { updateTagetId = mydiv }   something like that for jquery
[19:47:24] <sheilablackrose> basically everything is getting updated but the page is not refreshed
[19:47:34] <aqeel> happyface: may be jsfiddle your code
[19:47:59] <aqeel> Foxhoundz: i need assistance.. plugin actually
[19:48:10] <aqeel> so are you willing to spend your time..with me
[19:48:24] <aqeel> http://jailbreak.webege.com/js/plugins/aautoscroll.js
[19:49:47] <aqeel> i am implementing a few more of the functionality than it actually have.... original plugin... https://sites.google.com/site/danielgidmanresume/history/jquery-aautoscroll
[19:50:02] <aqeel> Foxhoundz: what say you?
[19:51:04] <Foxhoundz> This sounds like a very involved project
[19:51:14] <Foxhoundz> do you have a specific problem in mind?
[19:51:34] <Foxhoundz> Ask away, and if I can answer it, I will
[19:51:43] <dlam> is it just me, or does the safari 6 web inspector console NOT scroll down as more stuff is logged?
[19:51:57] * dlam hates constantly having to scroll down manually =\
[19:52:28] <Foxhoundz> dlam, use Google Chrome.
[19:52:32] <tw2113> people use safari?
[19:52:33] <Foxhoundz> Or Firebug + Firefox
[19:52:54] <Foxhoundz> I think Safari's inspector is still in its infancy
[19:54:12] <aqeel> ok the toend: (still needs tidying) was added by me and i have removed all dependencies like timers.js and it is jslinted clean...so now i am adding edgescroll: , where it the scroll hits the edge it scrolls in opposite direction else stops when hits the edge...
[19:55:17] <aqeel> i am not being able to decide as should i make this add externally or internally
[19:56:02] <coldhead> why not both
[19:56:06] <dlam> i need safaris inspector as i am debugging iphone simulator thing  :D
[19:56:15] <dlam> ohh ok
[19:57:52] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's all take five
[19:59:15] <sheilablackrose> how can i update or refresh a div
[20:00:21] <coldhead> restart the computer?
[20:00:27] <aqeel> lol
[20:00:53] <coldhead> ten twenty thirty forty tell me that you wanna hold me
[20:00:54] <aqeel> if F5 hangs yup restart indeed solves that?
[20:02:23] <aqeel> Foxhoundz: have you worked with plugins before?
[20:02:36] <Foxhoundz> No, I have not.
[20:03:24] <aqeel> wanna give a try... with what i am upto
[20:04:52] <happyface> if an element is replaced it's event handlers go with it, right?
[20:05:21] <happyface> like if I have a handler inside a div and do .html(..) on the div
[20:05:37] <aqeel> .html() replaces EVERYTHING
[20:07:36] <aqeel> jailbrteak.webege.com , click details, click menu first link, click submenu first link, and play with top buttons....toggle direction, ff, fr, play, pause, to top, to bottom....
[20:07:54] <sheilablackrose> so on the ajaxpost success: function(){.html();}
[20:07:54] <sheilablackrose> ?
[20:08:50] <aqeel> try all possible combinations....while pause to top/bottom, while play to bottom/top, if hits edge and not scrolling, toggle direction, ff and fw at play/pause
[20:19:11] <sheilablackrose> $('#documents').html(); doesnt really update it. any other sugestions
[20:19:11] <sheilablackrose> ?
[20:23:32] <aqeel> its not update but replaces or gets your contents
[20:24:04] <aqeel> if you want to update specify the updated content in html()
[20:24:37] <sheilablackrose> in the submit form method there is an ajaxoption updatetargetid right is there away to do that?
[20:30:56] <digitalmediaguy> I am looking for the best way to animate a pair of scissors cutting out a square with jQueryâ¦ Any thoughts on how I can do this?
[20:31:28] <digitalmediaguy> Maybe a sprite with some jquery .animate?
[20:32:54] <coldhead> even further away than when you were here
[20:33:57] <coldhead> digitalmediaguy: an animated gif to show the scissors in action and then animate() the position around the area being cut?
[20:34:34] <moimikey> digitalmediaguy: you could do something dirty with jquery.transit with its transition chaining if you don't want to write something from scratch
[20:38:54] <tw2113> $('#bills').mail();
[20:39:26] <coldhead> just like a poor porcelain doll
[20:40:04] <digitalmediaguy> Thanks coldheadâ¦
[20:40:11] <digitalmediaguy> I will look into it
[20:44:57] <coldhead> some stupid build tool won't let me use debugger; in my code because it's a reserved word
[20:45:07] <coldhead> can anyone think of a clever way to sneak it in?
[20:45:16] <snover> rohypnol
[20:45:23] <moimikey> snover: +1
[20:46:08] <coldhead> >: |
[20:46:22] <coldhead> you have an notification for my nick snover
[20:46:29] <coldhead> i can feel it
[20:46:37] <coldhead> no stupid question of mine goes unmocked
[20:47:23] <snover> i thought it was a pretty good answer. surprised you couldnât come up with it on your own though
[20:49:43] <coldhead> i am not sure how to give rohypnol to "jake"
[20:50:01] <coldhead> googling for jake and rohypnol gives um... fairly unsavoury results
[20:50:26] <coldhead> window.debugger; isn't a thing is it
[20:50:43] <coldhead> damn
[20:51:03] <Suppa_Spic> question
[20:51:11] <Suppa_Spic> I have this structure: <div id="thisone"><table></table> <div><table></table></div> </div> but when I append something with $('#thisone table:nth-child(1)').append() it appens to both of them
[20:51:41] <Suppa_Spic> doesn't select only the first table of that element
[20:52:19] <coldhead> they are both the 1st and only child of their parent divs
[20:52:27] <coldhead> it would select the first if they were siblings
[20:52:33] <coldhead> but they're not
[20:52:39] <coldhead> try :first
[20:52:43] <coldhead> instead of :nth-child(1)
[20:52:49] <Suppa_Spic> hmm alright let's see
[20:52:49] <coldhead> it's less typing, too
[20:53:13] <Suppa_Spic> coldhead: well, this was an example, the actual structure they're the second child
[20:53:23] <Suppa_Spic> I suppose there's not a :second?
[20:53:44] <aqeel> odd even
[20:54:33] <oojacoboo> I'm doing an ajax request and when sending a null or undefined var, it actually sends it as a string "null" "undefined"
[20:54:33] <coldhead> :nth(1)
[20:54:46] <coldhead> err
[20:54:49] <coldhead> :eq(1)
[20:54:50] <oojacoboo> how can I have it send nothing, I guess
[20:54:54] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/
[20:55:05] <Suppa_Spic> I tried odd, didnt work, still selects both :/
[20:55:06] <oojacoboo> without writing additional logic to include or not include the var
[20:55:17] <coldhead> oojacoboo: if (data) $.ajax(...) ?
[20:55:24] <oojacoboo> no
[20:55:33] <coldhead> yes i see your qualifier now
[20:55:33] <oojacoboo> it's a shared function add/edit
[20:55:41] <oojacoboo> I may have the id passed or not
[20:56:23] <oojacoboo> I mean, I could default it to something if I wanted and check on server side, but I'd prefer to send nothing or something that handles more cleanly server-side
[20:56:50] <Suppa_Spic> alright eq(0) worked :)
[20:57:01] <oojacoboo> maybe id = id || "";
[20:57:14] <oojacoboo> since null and undefined are freaking strings...
[20:57:58] <oojacoboo> id = id || ""; //does the trick
[20:58:43] <coldhead> good to know
[20:59:34] <oojacoboo> "" == false
[20:59:40] <oojacoboo> "null" == true
[20:59:44] <oojacoboo> obv
[21:00:11] <oojacoboo> at least in php :)
[21:04:30] <imsky> oh jaboweary
[21:05:36] <oojacoboo> imsky: leave jaboweary out of this
[21:05:53] <imsky> it owes me ten bucks
[21:06:05] <oojacoboo> in that case...
[21:06:17] <imsky> oh yes
[21:06:44] <sheilablackrose> im trying to concatenate a string from some ids. can anyone take a look athis http://jsfiddle.net/xAS5C/
[21:07:03] <imsky> hey sheila
[21:07:32] <imsky> you sure this is running in a .ready handler?
[21:07:33] <sheilablackrose> hi
[21:07:47] <sheilablackrose> im not sure im going with the flow
[21:07:50] <sheilablackrose> basically
[21:07:56] <sheilablackrose> the string is concatenation of checkbox ids
[21:08:04] <imsky> yeah i see what you're doing
[21:08:30] <sheilablackrose> n check item are checkboxes n it value will b the combination of ids
[21:08:51] <imsky> yeah so why isn't it working?
[21:08:56] <sheilablackrose> did i do it correctly?
[21:09:07] <imsky> maybe
[21:09:41] <sheilablackrose> is there like a better way? in c# we have something like  stringFlagIds = string.Join(",", Model.FlagIds);
[21:09:55] <sheilablackrose> is there any function for combining
[21:10:02] <sheilablackrose> n add a , in between
[21:10:28] <imsky> why don't you console.log $(this).attr("id") to make sure it works
[21:11:46] <sheilablackrose> im getting an error that say l-value expected
[21:11:56] <anew> hey guys any reason why this insanely easy 3 lines wouldnt run live? http://jsfiddle.net/DPmHt/

[21:14:00] <ryanneufeld> sheilablackrose: what html are you using? with that code?
[21:14:05] <sheilablackrose> is there something wrong with that
[21:14:09] <sheilablackrose> it says L-value expected
[21:14:17] <ryanneufeld> sheilablackrose: yes, there is everything wrong with that
[21:14:18] <imsky> yeah your code is wrong sheila

[21:23:56] <imsky> sheilablackrose: looks good to me, you could rewrite it using map reduce but who does that

[21:27:40] <ryanneufeld> `ask
[21:27:47] <imsky> lololol
[21:28:03] <ryanneufeld> otters: just ask your question man, don't wait for experts :)

[21:32:08] <ryanneufeld> tw2113: sssshhhh
[21:32:12] <ryanneufeld> tw2113: that's a secret!
[21:32:22] <tw2113> shhh it's a secret to everyone
[21:33:04] <imsky> i thought you were already op

[21:34:58] <imsky> i am op for the night
[21:35:07] <imsky> i want to thank my manager coldhead
[21:35:19] <ryanneufeld> ha!
[21:35:22] <otters> http://pastie.org/5555845
[21:35:26] <ryanneufeld> awww :(
[21:35:47] <otters> some wordpress theme is causing havoc with my WP admin dashboard, and I don't have the faintest idea what's going on here
[21:36:05] <ryanneufeld> otters: ahh
[21:36:10] <ryanneufeld> there is a trick to that
[21:36:34] <ryanneufeld> otters: I'm looking
[21:36:40] <otters> ok
[21:37:09] <ryanneufeld> otters: http://css-tricks.com/snippets/wordpress/include-jquery-in-wordpress-theme/
[21:37:12] <ryanneufeld> there you go
[21:37:19] <otters> ryanneufeld: oh, and level 3 is in jquery.ui.mouse.js
[21:37:39] <ryanneufeld> lolwut?
[21:37:44] <otters> haha
[21:37:47] <otters> did you even read my paste
[21:38:47] <ryanneufeld> otters: I have no idea what these levels are
[21:38:54] <otters> in the pastie
[21:38:54] <ryanneufeld> but you said something was conflicting with your admin theme
[21:38:56] <otters> that I pasted
[21:39:00] <ryanneufeld> I can see them,
[21:39:01] <otters> it's a stack trace
[21:39:10] <otters> i can't figure out how to make it user-friendly to view
[21:39:13] <otters> unless chrome can export them
[21:39:14] <ryanneufeld> that's nice
[21:39:21] <ryanneufeld> here's the thing
[21:39:42] <ryanneufeld> you said a wordpress theme is wreaking havock with your wp admin dashboard
[21:39:53] <otters> uh huh
[21:39:53] <ryanneufeld> so I gave you that snippet above to fix it
[21:40:07] <ryanneufeld> chances are, the theme is including jquery on it's own
[21:40:16] <ryanneufeld> but wordpress bundles it's own version
[21:40:29] <ryanneufeld> and if you add another one, things break
[21:41:04] <ryanneufeld> so, I'm suggesting you check the theme, to see if that's what it's doing. If it is. then you can modify it to do it the wordpress way I linked you to
[21:42:23] <otters> oh
[21:42:31] <otters> well the script I'm getting the errors from is in wp-includes
[21:42:34] <otters> but yeah that might be it
[21:43:40] <ryanneufeld> if the script in wp-includes is expecting a different version of jquery
[21:43:44] <ryanneufeld> then that could explain it
[21:45:33] <otters> ahaaaaaa
[21:45:42] <otters> yeah this theme included its own version of jquery-ui
[21:45:47] <otters> why are people so goddamn stupid
[21:46:18] <ryanneufeld> Yeah, the WP docs don't exactly make it easy to realize that
[21:46:31] <ryanneufeld> and it might have worked when they built the theme
[21:46:49] <otters> It probably did
[21:47:03] <otters> Still, I wish my client hadn't paid money for this thing
[21:47:50] <ryanneufeld> now they're paying you to fix it
[21:47:55] <ryanneufeld> and I told you how for free
[21:48:02] <ryanneufeld> sounds like you're the winner here
[21:48:24] <otters> well, I'm fixing it for free
[21:48:31] <snover> thatâs your first mistake
[21:48:32] <otters> as he isn't the one who does maintenance
[21:48:38] <ryanneufeld> then I should charge you
[21:48:42] <otters> go for it
[21:48:43] <snover> actually i guess it is like your second mistake
[21:49:01] <snover> actually, the more i think about it, you probably made many mistakes to end up where you are right now
[21:49:07] <snover> i am very sorry for your hard life
[21:49:52] <otters> it's amazing that no matter where you go on freenode, people give you shit for associating with wordpress
[21:50:10] <oojacoboo> it is kinda bad
[21:50:26] <oojacoboo> and the koolaid tastes better otters
[21:50:38] <otters> oh undoubtedly
[21:50:53] <otters> but it's definitely batteries included for a small site
[21:51:06] <tw2113> i encourage people to use WP
[21:51:12] <tw2113> fuck the haters :D
[21:51:21] <imsky> wp sucks tho
[21:51:28] <imsky> how you gon promote
[21:52:08] <tw2113> it makes me money, quite honestly
[21:52:37] <otters> yeah but the average guy on freenode would rather have the moral superiority of not using wordpress
[21:52:39] <otters> over having money
[21:52:44] <imsky> tw2113: it costs me time
[21:52:51] <otters> time is money
[21:52:59] <imsky> being a wordpress expert is very very low on the totem pole
[21:53:09] <imsky> it's like being a web janitor
[21:53:11] <otters> what's the totem pole
[21:53:13] <otters> oh
[21:54:53] <ryanneufeld> I like WP
[21:55:03] <ryanneufeld> it's the shortest path from nothing to a functioning web site
[21:55:04] <imsky> no surprises there
[21:55:12] <imsky> no the shortest path is html files
[21:55:18] <tw2113> jQuery core people contributed to the latest version too
[21:55:41] <oojacoboo> imsky: shhhâ¦ don't tell them all the secrets
[21:55:55] <imsky> it's ok i'm already on to the next thing
[21:55:56] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/eS49U/1/ anyone can help why this validate plugin is not working?
[21:55:59] <imsky> haskell web frameworks!
[21:56:05] <imsky> gonna be rrrrich
[21:56:11] <oojacoboo> lul
[21:56:14] <otters> hahahaha
[21:56:31] <tw2113> it's fine to be elitist and all for your own personal stuff, but when Joe Client needs an easy way to manage their own content...
[21:56:39] <imsky> then wordpress is the worst option
[21:56:52] <ryanneufeld> anew: you haven't included the plugin in your fiddle
[21:57:00] <anew> well that's a start lol
[21:57:54] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/eS49U/2/
[21:57:57] <anew> still not working here tho
[21:59:42] <anew> anyone ?
[22:00:02] <ryanneufeld> anew: some rules would helpo
[22:00:15] <anew> if you run without any rules it shoudl just default
[22:00:27] <anew> but let me add a rule for the one input box and see what happens
[22:02:22] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/eS49U/5/
[22:02:23] <anew> still not
[22:03:24] <ryanneufeld> anew: you cannot have - in json names unless you quote them
[22:03:57] <ryanneufeld> anew: and fixed http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/eS49U/6/
[22:04:07] <anew> boom, yep ur right.  thanks !!!
[22:04:16] <anew> would have taken an hour fo rme to figure out
[22:04:17] <anew> thanks
[22:05:06] <ryanneufeld> not if you learned to use your console
[22:05:14] <ryanneufeld> took me about 1second to find that
[22:05:28] <anew> wut, how did u see that in console
[22:05:43] <imsky> ryan's a pro
[22:06:09] <ryanneufeld> anew: http://cl.ly/image/3T3B3i3Z1r0l
[22:06:38] <anew> actually a question about that
[22:06:59] <anew> when i get errors such as these and click to find them... i always get the chrome tab with somethin glike window.3234343
[22:07:08] <tw2113> am i the only one amazed at how many people come into js/jquery not using inspector tools at all?
[22:07:09] <anew> so i can never find where the error is if it's a long file
[22:07:58] <ryanneufeld> anew: http://cl.ly/image/2Y1r0F160Q2A
[22:08:03] <anew> tw2113 yeah it's amaZing people arent born that way
[22:08:03] <ryanneufeld> seems pretty easy to find to me
[22:08:16] <anew> well in this case yes
[22:08:21] <anew> let me get another one
[22:08:34] <ryanneufeld> tw2113: what's more is I'm amazed at how many people debug using alert(), with ajax
[22:08:50] <ryanneufeld> and then wonder why it doesn't work when they take the alert out
[22:09:03] <tw2113> i guess the elitist in me is more amazed that tutorials don't emphasize as much as i think they should. Hopefully all new/current ones aimed at beginners do
[22:09:27] <ryanneufeld> tw2113: well, I always point people to the console
[22:09:34] <anew> like when i click some uncaught error many times i get the name of the php file then inside sources the only thing is "window.script1355983556508=1;"
[22:09:37] <anew> or some varient
[22:10:32] <ryanneufeld> anew: without an example I can't help you figure that case out
[22:11:01] <anew> meh  ok
[22:11:03] <oojacoboo> I hate adding settings pages...
[22:11:16] <tw2113> "WordPress sucks, use something else"?"Firefox blows, use chrome"
[22:11:28] <imsky> HEY
[22:11:36] <ryanneufeld> LISTEN
[22:11:37] <imsky> wordpress does suck
[22:11:48] <imsky> i can't believe self avowed web developers would think otherwise
[22:11:52] <imsky> maybe it pays for your BABY MILK
[22:11:56] <imsky> but it's still garbage
[22:12:25] <tw2113> ryanneufeld and i are full of Zelda moments tonight
[22:12:51] <ryanneufeld> we are?
[22:13:18] <tw2113> you saying LISTEN" after imsky said hey, reminded me of Ocarina of Time
[22:13:36] <imsky> ur my shining armor
[22:13:37] <tw2113> and me quoting "it's a secret to everyone" is a long running joke for the series
[22:13:41] <ryanneufeld> Yes, that was the point
[22:13:45] <tw2113> :D
[22:13:57] <ryanneufeld> I've NEVER played the game!
[22:13:59] * ryanneufeld ducks
[22:14:04] <oojacoboo> ha
[22:14:09] <oojacoboo> greatest game of all time
[22:14:23] <oojacoboo> and the last game I've played in whatâ¦ 15 years?
[22:14:25] <yogurt_truck> pfff
[22:14:39] * yogurt_truck ran out of air
[22:14:43] <oojacoboo> ok, maybe super mario bros
[22:14:52] <oojacoboo> but it's #2 then
[22:15:58] <coldhead> the greastest game of all time was the arcade version of wrestlemania
[22:16:53] <tw2113> imsky must think the internet is in dire need of repair. Last I recall, WP had about 50% of the CMS market and 17% of the internet overall
[22:17:02] <imsky> lol
[22:17:09] <imsky> php has what, 95% of the market
[22:17:17] <imsky> why don't you ask what people think of it
[22:17:24] <rmill> html has 100%
[22:17:30] <oojacoboo> not quite
[22:17:31] <imsky> not html5 stupid
[22:17:55] <oojacoboo> imsky: is what we like to call a brocoder
[22:18:37] <imsky> hmm
[22:18:42] <imsky> i wonder if that's accurate
[22:18:55] <yogurt_truck> ok then let's just start throwing around market share percentages
[22:19:09] <oojacoboo> imsky: they're the ones that rave about all the new stuff, the coolest toys
[22:19:23] <oojacoboo> the ones that in many circles are considered to be unproven
[22:19:28] <coldhead> 87% of statistics are made up, 27% of people know that
[22:19:33] <oojacoboo> maybe they'll be awesome, maybe not
[22:20:33] <tw2113> didn't abraham lincoln say that coldhead ?
[22:22:03] <imsky> no i did
[22:22:13] <imsky> but then again
[22:22:15] <tw2113> citation needed
[22:22:16] <imsky> i am abraham lincoln
[22:24:02] <coldhead> remember when that old dude fell up the escalator?
[22:25:04] <yogurt_truck> I remember quite clearly
[22:25:15] <anew> everyone american in here ?
[22:25:18] <imsky> NO
[22:25:21] <imsky> DEATH TO MERKAH
[22:25:29] <oojacoboo> brocoder
[22:25:36] <imsky> i'm in rehab
[22:25:38] <tw2113> remember when the Dell Dude fell in the forest and no one cared?
[22:25:40] <anew> lol
[22:25:49] <anew> u can tell when the room is all americans
[22:25:49] <yogurt_truck> what's this brocoder thing?
[22:26:00] <imsky> a way for dorky nerds to call out less dorky nerds
[22:26:01] <yogurt_truck> anew: you certainly can't
[22:26:02] <coldhead> what have you got against americans
[22:26:09] <coldhead> they're a fine proud brave people
[22:26:20] <oojacoboo> yogurt_truck: it's the hipster coders
[22:26:23] <coldhead> with very low incidence of obesity and school shootings
[22:26:25] <tw2113> yet stupid
[22:27:03] <yogurt_truck> oojacoboo: ah, you mean like imsky?
[22:27:11] <anew> hah
[22:27:11] <oojacoboo> yes
[22:27:20] <oojacoboo> he's def a brocoder
[22:27:50] <oojacoboo> rails/nginx/jquery/coffeescript/bootstrap/linux only
[22:27:53] <anew> room seems more on edge when it's more murikans than when it's more international
[22:27:54] <imsky> lol
[22:27:55] <oojacoboo> amirite?
[22:27:57] <imsky> no
[22:28:00] <imsky> hate rails and coffeescript
[22:28:09] <imsky> you're terribly wrong SIR
[22:28:09] <oojacoboo> oh wait...
[22:28:14] <oojacoboo> django
[22:28:47] <oojacoboo> and he only codes in VIM
[22:28:49] <yogurt_truck> lol jquery?
[22:28:57] <tw2113> brocoders don't like coffeescript unless it's a decaf soy latte
[22:29:00] <imsky> what's wrong with you dorts
[22:29:20] <yogurt_truck> jquery stopped being hip like 10 end-of-the-worlds ago
[22:29:41] <oojacoboo> yogurt_truck: true, it's more of a standard now
[22:29:58] <oojacoboo> jquery is def NOT brocoder
[22:30:02] <yogurt_truck> i saw on national geographic that the mayas where like "jquery? nigga please"
[22:31:42] <oojacoboo> lmfao - http://vimeo.com/47038270
[22:31:47] <yogurt_truck> disagree with jquery being anything like a standard, but ok
[22:31:49] <coldhead> what do we really gain by making this arbitrary distinctin between brocoders and non-brocoders
[22:33:19] <tw2113> street cred
[22:33:20] <yogurt_truck> ugh, a video of dev-related "comedy". no play ever.
[22:34:16] <coldhead> let me tell you something about mice
[22:34:27] <coldhead> oh sorry, wrong window
[22:34:35] <oojacoboo> lol
[22:34:40] <yogurt_truck> stewart lee?
[22:34:46] <coldhead> hi5 yogurt_truck
[22:34:54] <yogurt_truck> :>
[22:34:57] <coldhead> let's be friends forever
[22:35:16] <yogurt_truck> no
[22:35:17] <coldhead> i just have to check with my mother
[22:35:21] <coldhead> oh okay
[22:35:23] <yogurt_truck> but yes, favorite comedian atm
[22:35:25] <coldhead> that saves me having to call her
[22:35:29] <coldhead> sorry to have bothered you
[22:35:53] <yogurt_truck> I forgive you, coldhead
[22:36:09] <oojacoboo> yogurt_truck: is that really a thing
[22:36:16] <oojacoboo> and do you own one?
[22:36:41] <oojacoboo> I guess iced yogurt wouldn't be a bad idea
[22:36:58] <oojacoboo> the brick and mortars are mad popular
[22:37:05] <yogurt_truck> are you gonna start dissing yogurt now?
[22:37:19] <oojacoboo> I quite like it ;)
[22:37:19] <coldhead> i'll diss your spelling
[22:37:23] <coldhead> it's got an H in it
[22:37:27] <coldhead> right in the middle
[22:37:52] <yogurt_truck> both are valid, you head of coldness
[22:37:54] <tw2113> right there? *points*
[22:38:23] <oojacoboo> britts
[22:38:47] <coldhead> commonwealthers
[22:38:57] <LearnerJq> what is the best jquery sliding boxes or caption plugin around?currently i am looking into http://buildinternet.com/project/mosaic/....mosaic?basically i am creating a Drupal Module for sliding boxes and i want to use the best plugin in it
[22:39:12] <yogurt_truck> those brits and their bloody tv shows that only run for 2 short seasons instead of running until every trace of quality is gone!
[22:39:20] <coldhead> ALONG LONG BEACHESSSS AND STICKY FIELLLDS
[22:40:39] <yogurt_truck> LearnerJq: Scrolling what, blocks? Content fields? Or any random thing? I'm sure there must be some contrib modules for D7 that do that. Or maybe most are tied to Views or something.
[22:43:35] <LearnerJq> yogurt_truck: there are a few...and yes what module i am going to develop will be tied to views as well...much like THE VIEWS SLIDESHOW module..but to my knowledge and research there is no sliding boxes module in Drupal 7..
[22:44:08] <jeremy-> is there any native click "toggle" (click once for state 1, once for state 2) in jquery or would you need to add a class then do a conditional
[22:44:23] <jeremy-> I noticed .toggle but that seems to apply to visibility
[22:45:19] <yogurt_truck> LearnerJq: if I were you I'd just use some lightweight plugin that handles the sliding (jquery carousel lite comes to mind), and have my drupal module handle the conventions/logic for templating and initialization of those things
[22:45:38] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[22:46:04] <coldhead> "Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks."
[22:46:56] <jeremy-> right, my initial test must have bugge dout, thanks
[22:47:02] <oojacoboo> jeremy-: http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[22:47:05] <oojacoboo> maybe?
[22:47:16] <LearnerJq> yogurt_truck: ok thanks....
[22:48:30] <LearnerJq> one more thing please...the JQuery Templating plugin is still in use or has gone obsolete?i have returned after a long time to this channel and i once had heard that it is not maintained anymore
[22:48:31] <jeremy-> Thanks very useful both of you
[22:48:56] <coldhead> it is utterly abandoned, LearnerJq
[22:49:04] <coldhead> terrible things happen when you try to use it
[22:49:25] <oojacoboo> LearnerJq: check out _underscore's template
[22:49:37] <coldhead> or mustache or handlebars
[22:50:07] <oojacoboo> I personally like the flexibility of underscore, but that's me
[22:50:21] <LearnerJq> coldhead:oojacoboo...thanks..u saved my time of re-learning it
[22:50:23] <jeremy-> Any idea why when i place this inside the toggle handler it creates an error in the comma (,) for the second part of the toggle event..... kcTable.rowReordering({sURL:"/dtserver/keyword/UpdateRowOrder.php"}
[22:50:37] <jeremy-> yet it works on its own in a single click or toggle handle
[22:50:54] <oojacoboo> sURL?
[22:50:58] <jeremy-> oh, nvm
[22:51:06] <jeremy-> i was blind due to being tired
[22:51:20] <jeremy-> its a datatables api function
[22:51:32] <oojacoboo> k
[23:26:13] <coldhead> happy apocalypse, dearly beloved
[23:41:22] <nickSwe> I have a json dataset that contains parent id (0 for top level), and based on that json object I wish to dynamically generate a <UL> with child elements... Anyone who can help me to the right direction?
[23:41:28] <nickSwe> The dataset looks like this: "data":[{"orgitem_id":1,"parent_id":0,"teammember_id":0,"is_category":1,"category_title":"LHD Technical Service"},{"orgitem_id":2,"parent_id":1,"teammember_id":1,"is_category":0,"category_title":"Category title"}]
