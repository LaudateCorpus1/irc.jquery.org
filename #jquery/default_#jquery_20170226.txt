[00:20:29] <whirled> $(".glyphicon.market-icon").hide();
[00:20:38] <whirled> use the "." before your classnames.
[00:37:24] <tona> hi everyone
[00:37:54] <tona> how could i hide one icon in jquery , i am trying  $(".glyphicon market-icon").hide(); i hope someone advice me :)
[00:38:04] <whirled> no spaces
[00:38:30] <whirled> notice in my previous response, there was no space?
[00:39:41] <whirled> if the class market-icon is a child of class glyphicon, you would add the space $(".glyphicon .market-icon").hide()
[00:39:54] <whirled> but you still have to start your classes with "."
[00:40:12] <tona> ok let me try thanks so much
[00:41:11] <tona> not i am not able to hide it :(
[00:41:17] <tona> $(".glyphicon .market-icon").hide();
[00:41:20] <tona> i tried it
[00:41:47] <whirled> copy the html around there a little bit and paste it into JSfiddle.net   then post the link back here
[00:42:19] <ZoiX> $(".glyphicon.market-icon").hide();
[00:43:31] <tona> the last one works :)
[00:43:35] <tona> thanks everyone
[04:22:34] <kl> hello, does anyone know which video format youtube uses?
[04:24:05] <deepy> kl: depends on the video, why do you wonder?
[04:24:24] <kl> for example what about a live stream?
[04:24:36] <kl> I know there's .ts files that's called transport stream
[04:25:01] <kl> do they store multiple file types?
[04:27:59] <kl> deepy do you know something about that?
[04:30:02] <deepy> I do but I'm a bit short on time so I can't fill you in on all the details, what do you intend to do?
[04:30:14] <kl> do you know chromecast?
[04:30:44] <kl> I want to know how they do so live stream is casting to chromecast

[09:17:08] <rond_>  Hi! I have a script with ajax.get ... then {foor loop that handles GET Rest and creates table with some content (for example button).  i want this button to show modal (easy with bootstrap), but also to put content of data[i] to this modal. right now i have: button.click({json: data[i]}, fillModal); (data[i] is data for current row) and function fillModal(event) { console.log(event.json); $('#modal-body-content').text(event.json); }, 
[09:27:50] <rond_> i forgot to use event.data.json... nevermind
[10:26:33] <rond_>  Hi! I have a button with attached event (script)on click. then i copy this button and place it in some place (via button.clone().appendTo(...)). Why isn't the script executed? (when i click on the button that's been cloned, it works)

[14:09:02] <Nephro> Does anyone know why Lightslider can only appear after rezising the window if it is populated asynchronously?
[14:35:52] <xdevnull_> Hello
[14:41:23] <juinn> anyone about please?
[17:10:40] <whirled> juinn? what's the problem?
[17:13:24] <whirled> if I get an error that says Jquery.Deferred exception Cannot read property 'replace' of undefined   where should I start looking for my error?
[17:15:20] <shoky> there's no good answer to that question really.. wherever the error came from ;p
[17:15:30] <shoky> highly dependent on context
[17:15:52] <shoky> but looking at the stacktrace of the error is first place..
[18:15:19] <lightstep> Anyone online at the moment?
[20:06:13] <Nizam> Need help on the #jquery slider
[20:28:56] <whirled> how can I access the data-prefixed properties on an html element. $(item).data('prop") doesn't work and $(item).prop('data-prop") doesn't work.
[20:34:06] <whirled> nvm all props are lowercase. my bad. .data() works.
[21:40:44] <whirled> Does the select element fire an "open" event or "show" event or something?
