[00:05:57] <JosefDe> Hi guys. I want to collapse multiple table rows when clicking on a special th. Do you have examples for me how to do that?
[01:13:30] <DubstepCraig> How do I set the innertext of an element using jquery?
[01:15:05] <A1234A> $(element).text('Text here');
[01:24:53] <monk3y> Hi all.  I'm looking for a way to validate a single email field, that's not wrapped in a form (submitted with ajax).  The jQueryValidate plugin wants a form, it seems.  Is there an easier way?
[01:28:22] <A1234A> monk3y: http://jsfiddle.net/McWatt/hNB8s/
[01:29:55] <monk3y> A1234A: heh yeah, that's what I feared. I was hoping jQuery Validate or a simpler plugin might have packaged that, but that was my plan-B.
[01:30:15] <monk3y> A1234A: thanks for that.  Will give it a go.
[02:23:08] <cyberbrai> GM :)
[03:30:58] <robhol> monk3y: uh, couldn't you just wrap it in a form? :p
[05:21:25] <socialblogsite> how do I detect device type of “printer” with jQuery?
[05:26:46] <axscode> hi guys, i have span about hundreds of them, with each has r_1_1, r_1_2, r_1_3 ... each has unique class name.
[05:27:57] <axscode> when i did $(.r_1_1).removeClass(); and addClass(); the second time i call my function removeClass addClass its not functioning on other class name
[05:28:29] <axscode> even if i use $(document).find('.r_1_2').addClass();
[05:35:39] <socialblogsite> axscode: you have missing quotation marks inside $( ). The class name should go between quoations.
[05:36:01] <axscode> yes i do have
[05:36:53] <axscode> sorry i was typing fast, but pseudocode its something like that. with single quotes... should it be double instead of single
[05:36:56] <socialblogsite> axscode: so everything indicates .r_1_1 is matching every class including .r_1_2 ?
[05:36:59] <axscode> actually its a variable
[05:37:50] <socialblogsite> axcode: make sure the variable is not undefined, otherwise you might be removing ALL classes.
[05:38:22] <axscode> i have like $('.r_'+group+'_'+item).removeClass('close'); $('.r_'+group+'_'+item).addClass('open');  <==== sorry this one.
[05:40:08] <socialblogsite> axcode: maybe the jquery set gets reduced to cero items once they lack the class, not matching anymore.
[05:40:54] <socialblogsite> axcode: create a variable with the matching elements and then try in two steps performed on the same var
[05:41:31] <goodygum> hello, i've got in my SVG file some labels in a 'text' attribute'
[05:42:06] <goodygum> i do want to extract the values of it, but when 'dummy=' appears at the beginning of it
[05:42:38] <goodygum> because i've got <text>1.5</text> and <text>dummy=localhost</text>
[05:42:48] <goodygum> and I just want the second ones
[05:45:51] <axscode> hi sorry got isconnected
[05:53:38] <axscode> test
[05:53:47] <axscode> http://jsfiddle.net/9rt8q7qj/ <- it looks like this
[05:54:07] <axscode> ive changed it to #id
[05:54:34] <axscode> but same thing, just consider its under success: of $.ajax where i change it
[06:25:20] <nisseni> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2f30481b0957394ab878 - when setting 'json' I won't get done() when using the function. Removing it works fine. I'm guessing it's not a bug, but I should be able to use the data, still... Right?
[06:40:42] <Paradisee> hello o/
[06:41:29] <Paradisee> i have a menu with some <a>, how do i display on a console.log the url path?
[06:41:45] <Paradisee> $('.cat-accordion a').click(function(event) { console.log(event) });
[06:42:05] <Woet> Paradisee: $(this)
[06:42:11] <Paradisee> right ty
[06:43:28] <Paradisee> Object { 0: <a>, context: <a>, length: 1 }
[06:43:30] <Paradisee> i get this.
[06:44:53] <Paradisee> i need the url path as i said.
[06:46:02] <Woet> Paradisee: yes, $(this) refers to the element. now use one of the jQuery functions to get the url path
[06:46:06] <Woet> Paradisee: read the documentation
[06:46:09] <Woet> Paradisee: and/or use google
[06:46:30] <Paradisee> so .attr('href') i suppose
[06:46:45] <Woet> give it a go
[06:47:10] <Paradisee> yap: /products/category/76
[06:52:18] <marsjaninzmarsa> hi, I'm looking for lib similar to http://pointat.idenations.com/demo or http://demo.tutorialzine.com/2011/09/jquery-pointpoint-plugin/ but with arrow "sticked" to element
[07:03:34] <Paradisee> can someone check if there's a function that redirect me to a clicked link? http://dpaste.com/1MAPN9M
[07:03:52] <Paradisee> i didnt write this code, and i'm not a js programmer.
[07:04:28] <Paradisee> actually, i want to modify this code to avoid to be redirected when i click on a link of the menu/accordion.
[07:04:40] <Paradisee> a see in the line 116: e.preventDefault();
[07:05:07] <Paradisee> and 131: document.location = self.attr('href');
[07:05:13] <Paradisee> may be the problem.

[08:36:48] <anli> Ah, now I could
[10:29:01] <cordovafan8> Hello. Any datatables users around? I'm having some trouble with jquery datatables ajax refresh. I'm getting a weird alert box 'DataTables Warning: table id="mytable" - none', and I can't seem to figure out what's wrong. All I am doing is populating a table with ajax results with the built-in ajax methods of datatables.
[10:29:18] <cordovafan8> If I click ok on the alert box everything appears as it should
[10:29:40] <cordovafan8> also there is no error in the actual ajax request/response, since this appears to show up correctly with code 200
[10:30:32] <cordovafan8> The issue appears to be triggered after initializing the table, but before any columns.render functions are called.
[10:58:07] <cordovafan8> For anyone else wondering, the issue turned out to be a reserved field in the datatables ajax response.
[10:58:23] <cordovafan8> I was sending the 'error' field, and this was reserved for datatables errors.
[10:58:30] <shotgundriver> cool
[10:58:57] <shotgundriver> was just about to play around
[11:06:28] <_lazarevsky> hi guys
[11:06:30] <_lazarevsky> i got a quick q
[11:06:38] <_lazarevsky> so in my client side code
[11:06:48] <_lazarevsky> I'm sending an ajax get to an API which returns a 200
[11:06:53] <_lazarevsky> I have verified that it does!
[11:07:19] <_lazarevsky> however, instead of triggering the success, for some unexplicable reason, the error callback is invoked
[11:07:27] <_lazarevsky> WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?! it's driving my crazy!
[11:08:15] <_lazarevsky> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2b434f7921cfece9021d
[11:09:04] <shoky> _lazarevsky: and what is the error?
[11:09:18] <shoky> could be a json parse error
[11:10:22] <_lazarevsky> shoky: how do I get the error
[11:10:35] <_lazarevsky> I have a reference to the object passed to the error callback
[11:10:40] <_lazarevsky> how do I extract the error message?
[11:10:46] <_lazarevsky> actually.. i can google that myself
[11:10:49] <shoky> _lazarevsky: log the 2nd and 3rd arguments to the error callback
[11:11:00] <shoky> error  Type: Function( jqXHR jqXHR, String textStatus, String errorThrown )
[11:11:58] <_lazarevsky> right away
[11:12:25] <_lazarevsky> shoky: "parsererror"
[11:12:31] <_lazarevsky> responseText: " "
[11:13:13] <shoky> yeah then it's probably a json parse error.  your server is responding with a json content-type  but the response body is not valid json
[11:13:25] <_lazarevsky> can't I just return an empty string as the response?
[11:13:34] <shoky> your options are:
[11:14:19] <shoky> 1) return valid json (an empty string is not valid json).  2) don't respond with a json content-type.  3)  set dataType: 'text'  on the $.ajax options, so it doesn't try to parse as json
[11:14:34] <shoky> 3 is easiest if you don't want to touch the server
[11:14:48] <shoky> but 1 or 2 are the proper solutions
[11:15:22] <_lazarevsky> 3 it is then
[11:15:22] <_lazarevsky> ;)
[11:15:27] <shoky> ;)
[11:26:41] <js_newbie> Can anyone tell me why this JS https://paste.debian.net/314496/ causes an <a  href="template"  class="btn btn-default">template</a> not to execute?
[11:29:34] <dumptruckman> hello
[11:29:50] <dumptruckman> any idea how efficient $.grep is?
[11:33:57] <shoky> dumptruckman: it's just a for loop
[11:34:39] <shoky> anyways javascript has builtin .filter for arrays
[11:37:47] <dumptruckman> shoky: would that be more efficient?
[11:38:08] <dumptruckman> or still a for loop
[11:39:08] <shoky> dumptruckman: well seems .filter does some extra stuff for you, so it might be somewhat less efficient
[11:39:31] <shoky> why does it matter
[11:40:40] <dumptruckman> i dunno, it probably doesn't :3
[11:40:47] <shoky> then it doesn't :)
[11:42:32] <dumptruckman> i want an array that functions as a map or a map that functions as an array
[11:42:39] <dumptruckman> probably the former
[11:42:41] <duch_kazatel> wut
[11:43:26] <shoky> ^
[11:43:55] <dumptruckman> i need to enumerate some objects
[11:44:02] <dumptruckman> but also be able to look them up by an id
[11:44:27] <duch_kazatel> how often are you enumerating on them?
[11:44:35] <duch_kazatel> because you probably just want an array you can .filter() against
[11:45:25] <shoky> you can always have both an array and a map, if it's really large or you're crazy or something
[11:47:32] <shoky> well, assuming you care about the order
[11:48:36] <duch_kazatel> if you're talking about ES6 maps, you still have an order, though those are based on insertion order, which may or may not be what you really want.
[11:49:36] <dumptruckman> i probably grep them a lot more than i enumerate them
[11:49:41] <dumptruckman> but
[11:49:57] <dumptruckman> there's one hiccup in using a map instead of an array
[11:50:15] <dumptruckman> which is this appery.io platform and its mapping feature
[11:50:25] <dumptruckman> that maps data to ui elements
[11:51:08] <duch_kazatel> when you talk about an array vs a map, do you mean an ES6 map?
[11:51:10] <duch_kazatel> or something else?
[11:51:17] <Pazician> Hello, how could I write this in a more better and smarter way? http://pastebin.com/X8BzJ6cK
[11:52:33] <duch_kazatel> Pazician pastebin won't load for me.  mind using something like jsfiddle or bpaste?
[11:52:49] <dumptruckman> i don't know what ES6 map is
[11:53:21] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: https://bpaste.net/show/573ae958337d
[11:53:24] <dumptruckman> like a js equivalent of a java.util.Map
[11:53:38] <duch_kazatel> dumptruckman heh glad I asked. there's an actual thing called a Map in es6 - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map
[11:53:49] <duch_kazatel> it's a basic key/value pair, but only available in es6
[11:54:43] <dumptruckman> what is es6?
[11:54:53] <dumptruckman> oh
[11:55:12] <duch_kazatel> Pazician that's about as good as you can get.
[11:55:34] <dumptruckman> does using es6 depend on the client?
[11:55:41] <duch_kazatel> Pazician i might prepend those jquery objects with $ but that's just a stylistic thing.
[11:55:43] <duch_kazatel> dumptruckman yes.
[11:56:00] <dumptruckman> sounds new... so probably not a good idea if i want a wide audience
[11:56:01] <duch_kazatel> you can get close with babel, but not all features are available.
[11:56:09] <dumptruckman> but
[11:56:19] <duch_kazatel> dumptruckman that's why i was trying to clarify what you meant by "map" :)
[11:56:19] <dumptruckman> that Map... could I use [i]?
[11:56:29] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: Really? What I've in mind is like I should use $(this)... or something like that. The thing is, I can't use $(this).find... since the elements isn't really structured for that kind of thing
[11:56:45] <duch_kazatel> Pazician then don't use $(this)?
[11:56:56] <duch_kazatel> dumptruckman you mean a for loop?
[11:57:33] <dumptruckman> yes, a for loop where i use an index specifically
[11:57:38] <duch_kazatel> no.
[11:57:46] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: Let's think that I've more than two elements and anchors I want to use, I would need to make like bunch of these exact same things for all of them, right? - So is there any way to get it to be more dynamic?
[11:57:58] <duch_kazatel> Pazician i'm not going play play "pretend to see the markup" today :)
[11:58:03] <duch_kazatel> share a functioning example.
[11:58:13] <duch_kazatel> dumptruckman you nevever really want for loops in the first place.
[11:59:40] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: Something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/my9Lu5L1/
[12:00:14] <duch_kazatel> brb 1 sec.
[12:00:42] <duch_kazatel> Pazician also: functioning.  that's not functioning ;)
[12:00:49] <dumptruckman> duch_kazatel: http://pastie.org/10462153 line 23
[12:01:06] <dumptruckman> ignore the function
[12:01:20] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: What's not functioning, my jQuery code?
[12:01:28] <dumptruckman> the source key:value... this is that mapping thing
[12:01:29] <duch_kazatel> Pazician i don't see any modals or anything.
[12:01:39] <duch_kazatel> dumptruckman pastie isn't working for me.
[12:01:44] <duch_kazatel> mind using bpaste or jsfiddle?
[12:02:14] <dumptruckman> duch_kazatel: https://jsfiddle.net/rmwkmhyk/
[12:02:40] <dumptruckman> so the mapping somehow uses this key:value source to get the data from my combat object in localstorage
[12:02:49] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: What about this one? https://jsfiddle.net/my9Lu5L1/1/
[12:03:04] <dumptruckman> i have no idea if i can specify a source with functions involved
[12:04:40] <dumptruckman> but it uses that to iterate over my data and create listitems
[12:04:55] <dumptruckman> which is nice because i have no idea how to do that myself
[12:04:56] <dumptruckman> :3
[12:05:15] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: Hold on, this one: https://jsfiddle.net/my9Lu5L1/2/
[12:06:33] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: Like this, but it should be dynamic, like using $(this) or similar way: https://jsfiddle.net/my9Lu5L1/3/
[12:06:56] <dumptruckman> i'm assuming it applies what follows the dollar sign to the data object
[12:06:59] <dumptruckman> to get the value
[12:08:10] <duch_kazatel> back.
[12:08:49] <duch_kazatel> dumptruckman so it's not a map, it's an object.
[12:08:58] <duch_kazatel> with some keys, one of which is an array.
[12:10:00] <duch_kazatel> dumptruckman check out using stuff like forEach and filter mapping.directions.mappings.forEach(function(currentMapping) { console.log(currentMapping.source) });
[12:10:13] <duch_kazatel> Pazician "should be dynamic" meaning...
[12:10:37] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: Like I don't need to specify which one specifically that was clicked
[12:10:39] <duch_kazatel> like, cta-custom should "automatically" reference the .custom dialog?
[12:11:21] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: More like, "a" should automatically know it should trigger the .custom, gotta be a way right?
[12:11:31] <duch_kazatel> not without tweaking your markup.
[12:11:50] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: Hmm... How possible should it look like?
[12:12:16] <duch_kazatel> give each <a> tag a data attribute that points to the dialog it's related to.
[12:12:55] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: Like this? https://jsfiddle.net/my9Lu5L1/4/
[12:13:25] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't use data-href since href has a specific meaning, but sure.,
[12:13:49] <dumptruckman> duch_kazatel: no no.. the big map in the paste is not what i'm trying to work with
[12:13:58] <duch_kazatel> dumptruckman then i'm lost :)
[12:14:22] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: I can change that to something more logically, I guess - but something like this? https://jsfiddle.net/my9Lu5L1/5/
[12:14:38] <dumptruckman> this map is an example of the template i have to use to get this platform to automatically map my data (see mapping.directions.from_name) to ui elements
[12:14:58] <dumptruckman> the big advantage here is that it takes my array and creates a mobileListItem for each element of the array
[12:15:08] <duch_kazatel> Pazician that code makes no sense./
[12:15:24] <dumptruckman> so my data is
[12:15:39] <dumptruckman> combat.combatants which is an array
[12:15:46] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: How should it possibly look like?
[12:15:47] <dumptruckman> but i am considering turning it into a map
[12:15:53] <duch_kazatel> dumptruckman an ES6 map?
[12:15:58] <dumptruckman> unlikely
[12:16:03] <dumptruckman> since that would reduce compatibility
[12:16:07] <duch_kazatel> dumptruckman then why do you keep calling it that?
[12:16:12] <duch_kazatel> that's why i'm confused i think :)
[12:16:19] <dumptruckman> what is {key:value} called in js?
[12:16:23] <duch_kazatel> an object.
[12:16:27] <dumptruckman> ok, an object
[12:16:44] <duch_kazatel> if you're going to enumerate basically at all on that, use an array.
[12:16:47] <duch_kazatel> instead of an object.
[12:16:49] <dumptruckman> ok
[12:17:00] <dumptruckman> i'll just grep for the id
[12:17:07] <duch_kazatel> you can also use .filter()
[12:17:19] <duch_kazatel> there are tons of array methods you can use here.
[12:17:58] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: Could you possible have an idea for this? https://jsfiddle.net/my9Lu5L1/8/
[12:18:18] <duch_kazatel> Pazician you realize $(this) only really makes sense inside of things like event handlers, right?
[12:18:29] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: Right
[12:18:33] <duch_kazatel> and .data() returns a string.
[12:18:40] <duch_kazatel> not a jquery object.
[12:18:53] <duch_kazatel> so armed with that knowledge, what do you think you need to do? :)
[12:19:24] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: Maybe make an wrap or something like that, that's wrapping around the whole elements?
[12:19:30] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[12:19:34] <duch_kazatel> you need to select things.
[12:19:36] <dumptruckman> btw
[12:19:53] <duch_kazatel> Pazician if you need to do $('.custom') and you have the string 'custom', how do you select the right element?
[12:19:54] <duch_kazatel> :)
[12:20:20] <Pazician> $(this).find('.custom'), maybe?
[12:20:25] <duch_kazatel> Pazician ...
[12:20:32] <Pazician> I don't know, come on...
[12:20:36] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/my9Lu5L1/10/
[12:20:46] <duch_kazatel> you should really check out learn.jquery.com
[12:20:51] <duch_kazatel> it'd be a big help for you.
[12:21:52] <Pazician> I was seriously lost there, and yes I've been reading learn.jquery.com, which section(s) would you recommend me to specifically read?
[12:21:57] <dumptruckman> does $['someProperty'] have any syntatical significance?
[12:22:02] <duch_kazatel> all of them at this point.
[12:22:11] <duch_kazatel> dumptruckman in JS?
[12:22:13] <dumptruckman> yeah
[12:22:16] <dumptruckman> or jquery
[12:22:19] <duch_kazatel> that would find $.someProperty
[12:22:23] <duch_kazatel> i would avoid it personally.
[12:23:09] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: Well, I'll get my ass on learn.jquery.com and try to read some of them tonight - thank you so much for your help!
[12:24:05] <dumptruckman> what does the dollar sign mean there?
[12:24:11] <dumptruckman> $.someProperty
[12:24:33] <lalalaaa> Hi! Is this the best way to exclude the last two elements? http://jsfiddle.net/ukf84gcq/
[12:24:56] <lalalaaa> Originally I wanted to use slice() but could only find a way to select the last two, not exclude the last two.
[12:25:45] <duch_kazatel> dumptruckman yeah.
[12:25:51] <duch_kazatel> those are the same thing.
[12:27:02] <duch_kazatel> lalalaaa you want .slice(0, -2)
[12:27:16] <lalalaaa> duch_kazatel: oooh now i get it
[12:27:19] <duch_kazatel> :)
[12:27:23] <lalalaaa> thanks :))
[12:29:08] <dumptruckman> duch_kazatel: no, i'm asking... what is the purpose of the dollar sign in $.someProperty
[12:29:12] <dumptruckman> what does it signify
[12:29:26] <duch_kazatel> generally, $ is the jquery object.
[12:31:32] <dumptruckman> and if it isn't?
[12:31:39] <duch_kazatel> then it's some other object.
[12:31:41] <dumptruckman> ok
[12:31:54] <duch_kazatel> mootools used $ as well for one of its selectors.
[12:32:00] <dumptruckman> so i might possibly be able to run a method with that reference
[12:32:11] <duch_kazatel> sure, but i wouldn't.
[12:32:15] <dumptruckman> how come?
[12:32:28] <duch_kazatel> because dot notation is generally easier to read.
[12:32:35] <dumptruckman> i mean like
[12:32:37] <dumptruckman> $.keys
[12:32:38] <dumptruckman> er
[12:32:41] <dumptruckman> $.keys()
[12:32:56] <dumptruckman> that's not dot notation?
[12:33:03] <duch_kazatel> that's dot notaion.
[12:33:12] <duch_kazatel> $['someproperty'] is what i'd avoid.
[12:33:17] <dumptruckman> ah yeah
[12:38:06] <jak2000> hi all
[12:38:26] <jak2000> how do it: if myIntval in (11,13,25) then
[12:38:40] <taplar> indexOf
[12:38:43] <duch_kazatel> wut
[12:38:55] <duch_kazatel> what is (11,13,25) ?
[12:39:22] <taplar> $.indexOf([11, 13, 25, myIntval) > -1
[12:39:26] <taplar> crap
[12:39:30] <taplar> $.indexOf([11, 13, 25], myIntval) > -1
[12:39:39] <duch_kazatel> fwiw you have a native indexOf() function available.
[12:40:00] <taplar> yeah
[12:40:21] <jak2000> ok
[12:40:25] <jak2000> thanks
[13:04:39] <logikos> in several stackoverflow examples regarding restful api and PUT i see jQuery().fileupload() being used but for the life of me i can not seem to find the jquery docs page for the function?
[13:04:49] <logikos> can someone provide me a url so i can read about it please?
[13:05:14] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[13:05:20] <duch_kazatel> it's a plugin
[13:05:28] <logikos> that explains it....
[13:05:45] <logikos> many of the stack overflow  posts make no mention of the plugin ... good to know, thanks
[13:05:54] <duch_kazatel> have an example of one of these posts?
[13:06:19] <logikos> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14788066/fileupload-fileupload-function-is-not-calling
[13:06:53] <duch_kazatel> the source code provided in the question links to files in jQuery-File-Upload-master
[13:07:10] <duch_kazatel> also: there's a blueimp tag, though i can see where the confusion may have come from.
[13:07:42] <logikos> anyway, thanks
[13:48:34] <saptak013> Hello everyone. I have been doing web development and other web related work for 2 years now and have used jquery quite often. So, I would really like to contribute to jquery. Can someone please guide me where and how to start?
[13:48:54] <taplar> hang out in this room.  help other people, ;)
[13:49:19] <duch_kazatel> saptak013 providing support here is a GREAT place to start.  you can also check out http://contribute.jquery.org/ for more info.
[13:49:56] <PurePandemonium> I've been hanging out here for a couple days. I'm not an expert, but I've been able to help a few people just by hanging out and answering questions
[13:50:17] <duch_kazatel> PurePandemonium most folks just need somebody pointing them in the right direction.
[13:50:47] <taplar> and being in a place you can observe issues and absorb the results thereof is great for learning too
[13:51:27] <duch_kazatel> also, http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#etiquette on down is full of really good information.
[13:51:54] <duch_kazatel> we're not here to provide code, we're here to help people learn.
[13:53:28] <saptak013> Ok. Thanks. Will surely hang around and try to help if I can.
[13:55:18] <PurePandemonium> duch_kazatel: oooh that's a good page. I'll have to keep that handy.
[13:55:25] <duch_kazatel> :)
[13:55:40] <duch_kazatel> lots of folks forget about how to ask good questions and how to give good answers.
[13:56:35] <PurePandemonium> Yeah. Asking a good question is definitely a skill. My friend likes to say a problem well defined is half-solved
[13:57:05] <duch_kazatel> asking people to create test cases is crucial.  i'd say about 1/3 of the time people figure out the problem on their own just from doing that.
[13:57:31] <taplar> and getting them past the whole 'its broke!' phrase...
[13:57:36] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[13:58:17] <PurePandemonium> How do you ask a newbie to make a test case?
[13:58:32] <taplar> can you show us an example of the issue?
[13:58:36] <duch_kazatel> "Hey could you replicate your problem on jsfiddle?"
[13:59:04] <PurePandemonium> gotcha
[13:59:54] <duch_kazatel> then you get a "it's a really big page and i can't replicate <some server-side piece>/<my db>/<ajax>"
[14:00:10] <taplar> :)
[14:00:19] <duch_kazatel> then you reply "javascript doesn't care about your server-side - i just neem a minimum test case"
[14:02:08] <nonconvergent> Hi.
[14:02:24] <taplar> hola
[14:02:26] <duch_kazatel> hello!
[14:02:35] <hassoon> d'oh
[14:02:44] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  then you direct them to how to make a variable that holds their JSON data they're using for their ajax :)
[14:02:45] <hassoon> given that html/php file  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e12dd844421d297e30bb  ,why the heck isn't that function  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f9a1f073c0c4905ab5cf   , that i wrote in my_js_code.js making the checkbox named 'all_client' have the other checkboxes named del_multiple inside the table's lines follow its checked state
[14:03:03] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac you can actually do ajax on jsfiddle fwiw.
[14:03:17] <duch_kazatel> hassoon javascript and php don't talk to each other.
[14:03:19] <hassoon> the elements (checkbox buttons) do exist in their right place
[14:03:20] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  yea but most people don't want to open their endpoint to a jsfiddle and show the world the url to it
[14:03:23] <duch_kazatel> hassoon share the html.
[14:03:29] <LindsayMac> hassoon:  ummm......
[14:03:32] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac you don't need to - there's an echo api.
[14:03:35] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: what?..
[14:03:38] <nonconvergent> Dunno if you it's offtopic, but I'm trying to add an "info" class to the closest tr element when a field is edited with jquery.  That info class is interpreted by boostrap and it does some nice highlighting.
[14:03:48] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  yea I tried that. I could never really understand it / get it to work..
[14:03:55] <duch_kazatel> hassoon are you trying to call PHP code from javascript?
[14:04:02] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: that's nothing but a html webpage, where half of it is generated by php using hte DB's data
[14:04:05] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  share some code you have
[14:04:18] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: you should take a look at the codes if you want to help me
[14:04:38] <LindsayMac> hassoon: its the markup that's important to javascript. Doesn't matter how the markup is created. Just copy the relevant markup from the page source
[14:05:08] <hassoon> LindsayMac: okey lemme recopy the part where the elements in-question exist
[14:05:56] <duch_kazatel> wow
[14:06:04] <duch_kazatel> nonconvergent what's the question?
[14:06:06] <LindsayMac> hassoon:  also don't get it twisted.. no one is chomping at the bit to help you.. don't be a jerk
[14:06:20] <hassoon> LindsayMac: what is that supposed tp mean
[14:06:23] <hassoon> *to mean
[14:06:29] <duch_kazatel> hassoon you got a little rude with me :)
[14:06:34] <duch_kazatel> just trying to help you.
[14:06:36] <taplar> lol, man any time someone says 'don't get it twisted' i start thinking eminem
[14:06:46] <LindsayMac> hassoon:  this was rude = http://cl.ly/image/452B3q441g2X
[14:07:06] <duch_kazatel> also: you don't need to use .each() here.
[14:07:14] <LindsayMac> taplar:  how do you know i'm NOT eminem ;)
[14:07:20] <duch_kazatel> and $(a) is unnecessary - a is alreayd a jquery object.
[14:07:23] <nonconvergent> https://gist.github.com/nonconvergent/81ec566554989ccf3b02 While I do see this is being added to the tr, I don't see the related change bootstrap is supposed to perform, based on the optional row classes https://bootstrapdocs.com/v2.2.2/docs/base-css.html#tables So I wonder if I'm adding it the wrong way.
[14:07:29] <duch_kazatel> a.prop('checked', false);
[14:07:31] <taplar> *lip quivers* ......really?
[14:07:47] <LindsayMac> mayyyyy be..
[14:08:18] <duch_kazatel> nonconvergent no clue - does the parent table have the right styles/markup?
[14:08:31] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: the thing here is that i awnted the checkbox button named 'all_client' to make all of the checkboxes that exist in the table's line and named 'del_multiple' follow up the former-checkbox's state
[14:08:35] <hassoon> *i wanted *
[14:08:54] <duch_kazatel> okay?  that doesn't change anything about what i said :)
[14:08:55] <LindsayMac> hassoon:  and people will help you if you show some cleaner, easier to read markup
[14:10:41] <nonconvergent> duch_kazatel: It shouldn't need any. It just has the classes table and table-condensed.  I tried making a dummy table on the same page to make sure, with the classes already statically applied, and it works.
[14:10:54] <duch_kazatel> nonconvergent dunno then.
[14:11:04] <duch_kazatel> maybe make sure your dom traversal is correct?
[14:11:56] <duch_kazatel> hassoon http://jsfiddle.net/ywpbnk6x/
[14:11:57] <duch_kazatel> fwiw
[14:12:21] <nonconvergent> I don't know what that means, but I looked at the tr in the debugger and the class is there.  I think that it's bootstrap...that it can't handle that class being added after the page render.
[14:12:23] <duch_kazatel> jquery does 99% of the work for you.
[14:12:44] <duch_kazatel> nonconvergent maybe?  that doesn't make much sense - if it's a css driven change, then bootstrap should be fine
[14:12:51] <duch_kazatel> maybe make a standalone case or something?
[14:13:08] <plamb> hi all, i have some jquery code that turns some <p>'s into inputs when a button is clicked, then when a save button is clicked uses the .val() of the input to replace the original text in the <p>. Works fine but it only works "once" i.e. click edit, click save, click edit again and nothing happens
[14:13:13] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: that's really an easier and cleaner example, let me follow it up in my code :o
[14:13:15] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  if I can see some code / example in front of me I might have an answer. I'm not too good at following described cases though.
[14:13:17] <plamb> http://pastebin.com/KiZby96h
[14:13:36] <duch_kazatel> plamb make a fiddle instead?
[14:13:39] <plamb> do i have to like reload it or something
[14:13:42] <disto> hello guys
[14:13:42] <duch_kazatel> woah.
[14:13:46] <duch_kazatel> that's a lot of code.
[14:13:49] <disto> I'd like to have a question
[14:13:50] <plamb> :(
[14:13:53] <LindsayMac> disto:  hah thought the same thing
[14:13:55] <taplar> plamb: probably not rebinding on the new elements
[14:13:58] <duch_kazatel> plamb you're replacing the p fully, huh?
[14:13:59] <LindsayMac> disto: ask
[14:14:01] <disto> do you know how to make zebrapad easily on Jquery ?
[14:14:10] <plamb> ahh taplar that makes sense
[14:14:14] <duch_kazatel> plamb use a delegated listener.
[14:14:16] <plamb> i probably am yeah
[14:14:17] <duch_kazatel> instead of rebinding.
[14:14:19] <taplar> plamb: you might try... ^
[14:14:24] <taplar> what duch beat me too, lol
[14:14:41] <plamb> hmm
[14:14:50] <plamb> first result on my google query for that was .on()
[14:14:53] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[14:14:58] <duch_kazatel> please read the whole section.
[14:15:03] <plamb> roger
[14:15:08] <duch_kazatel> i will know if you read just the first part :)
[14:15:13] <disto> do you know how to make zebrapad easily on Jquery ?
[14:15:13] <plamb> haha
[14:15:15] <plamb> okay okay
[14:15:19] <duch_kazatel> woah.
[14:15:22] <duch_kazatel> disto no need to spam.
[14:15:25] <duch_kazatel> "zebrapad"?
[14:15:51] <duch_kazatel> disto what is zebrapad?
[14:16:02] <disto> zebrapath ?
[14:16:17] <duch_kazatel> do you have a visual example?
[14:16:18] <LindsayMac> disto:  got an example of what you're trying to achieve?
[14:17:20] <disto> http://www.brekend.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/beb.png I wanna do it on a user list
[14:17:29] <disto> one row is lightgrey
[14:17:35] <disto> the next one is white color
[14:17:35] <duch_kazatel> oh, you want to alternate background colors.
[14:17:41] <duch_kazatel> and that's a css question.
[14:17:45] <duch_kazatel> not a jquery question :)
[14:17:50] <disto> duch_kazatel it's a zebrapad
[14:18:00] <duch_kazatel> i've never heard it called that before.
[14:18:08] <duch_kazatel> normally it's just "alternating background colors".
[14:18:11] <disto> duch_kazatel where are ya from ?
[14:18:17] <duch_kazatel> the US.
[14:18:27] <disto> that explains a lot why
[14:18:38] <LindsayMac> disto: never ever heard of it as a zebra pad but it was the first thing I thought of when you said that
[14:18:39] <taplar> looks like a crosswalk to me.  you people are crazy
[14:18:51] <LindsayMac> disto: either way... just use CSS .. very easy with classes
[14:18:57] <duch_kazatel> no need with classes.
[14:19:07] <LindsayMac> pseudo classes
[14:19:10] <taplar> :even :odd
[14:19:13] <duch_kazatel> boom
[14:19:17] <LindsayMac> .class::even
[14:19:18] <LindsayMac> yea
[14:19:28] <taplar> tr:even tr:odd
[14:19:32] <taplar> or whatever
[14:19:39] <LindsayMac> disto:  you can even go nuts and make it three or more alternatiting colors!!
[14:19:41] <LindsayMac> make a rainbow!
[14:20:56] <disto> look.. it needs to be in a list fetched from db
[14:21:02] <duch_kazatel> that's fine.
[14:21:06] <duch_kazatel> still can use CSS>
[14:21:09] <disto> so CSS is not the right option i guess
[14:21:13] <duch_kazatel> sure it is.
[14:21:13] <taplar> li:even li:odd
[14:21:14] <taplar> lol
[14:21:15] <duch_kazatel> ^
[14:21:24] <duch_kazatel> you don't have to do anything special with your HTML.
[14:21:39] <disto> gimme an example kurwa
[14:21:47] <duch_kazatel> taplar just did.
[14:22:09] <disto> oh okay
[14:22:14] <LindsayMac> disto: CSS is the right option.. where the data comes from does not matter
[14:22:21] <disto> thanks guyz
[14:22:43] <disto> duch_kazatel you're from us but originally from india right ?
[14:22:49] <duch_kazatel> disto huh?
[14:22:52] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[14:23:05] <duch_kazatel> northern california born and raised.
[14:23:05] <disto> your language ability is not very well
[14:23:07] <LindsayMac> disto: http://codepen.io/Paulie-D/pen/CBywn
[14:23:12] <duch_kazatel> disto uh...
[14:23:20] <duch_kazatel> i wasn't the only one who didn't understand what you mean.
[14:23:27] <LindsayMac> disto: umm.. as a native english speaker, I disagree with that.
[14:23:29] <duch_kazatel> but sure, ad hominem attacks are always welcomed.
[14:23:49] <disto> add into hominems *
[14:23:54] <duch_kazatel> lol
[14:23:59] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[14:24:03] <duch_kazatel> i meant ad hominem
[14:24:05] <LindsayMac> ok..now he's just trollin' around
[14:24:13] <duch_kazatel> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem disto ;)
[14:24:55] <disto> .not_trolling {background-color: white;}
[14:25:19] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/ehgrzg3p/
[14:25:23] <duch_kazatel> pretty easy stuff.
[14:25:25] <duch_kazatel> oh i'
[14:25:28] <nonconvergent> http://www.bootply.com/WasFPO5MGd I made a standalone case. The intention is that if you enter anything into the baz field, bar's row will change from the warning color to the success color (which is green I think).
[14:25:34] <PurePandemonium> I've never heard "zebrapad" before. When I googled it, I mostly got results in Dutch. Some might call it a zebra crossing, but it's not a common term
[14:25:52] <disto> it is a common term
[14:25:58] <duch_kazatel> disto where?
[14:25:59] <nonconvergent> The actual behavior is that nothing changes, although the class of the tr is correctly updated, upon inspection.
[14:26:01] <disto> google doesn't know evrything guys
[14:26:16] <plamb> okay duch_kazatel i sorta get it, but i think im already using delegated events?
[14:26:35] <LindsayMac> disto:  what in the fuck are you actually talking about now?
[14:26:37] <plamb> i use the on("click") in both blocks of code
[14:26:44] <duch_kazatel> plamb you didn't read the full article :)
[14:26:55] <plamb> i read to event performance
[14:26:59] <duch_kazatel> disto most people in this channel would use terminology you regularly hear in the industry.
[14:27:13] <duch_kazatel> plamb you want $(parent).on('event', 'child', function() {});
[14:27:27] <disto> https://www.google.lt/?gfe_rd=cr&ei=0cASVqPIOYeA8QeNwqDYAw#q=zebra+css
[14:27:28] <duch_kazatel> where parent is an ancestor element that exists on pageload and never goes away.
[14:27:33] <disto> https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css3-zebra-striping-a-table/
[14:27:40] <disto> https://css-tricks.com/snippets/php/php-zebra-striping-a-table/
[14:27:42] <plamb> yeah i read that i just didnt make the connection
[14:27:42] <duch_kazatel> disto so "zebra striping a table" is what you mean.
[14:27:44] <plamb> good point
[14:27:46] <disto> https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/jquery-zebra-stripe-a-table/
[14:27:52] <disto> enough with industry ?
[14:28:07] <duch_kazatel> disto you meant "zebra striping a table" - it's fine :)
[14:28:11] <LindsayMac> disto: I just sent you a link with a codepen that does that
[14:28:14] <duch_kazatel> you had a small misunderstanding about the term.
[14:28:23] <duch_kazatel> not a big deal.
[14:28:33] <disto> duch_kazatel god damn i believe you have misunderstanding
[14:28:39] <duch_kazatel> excuse me?
[14:28:47] <PurePandemonium> oh wow
[14:28:56] <disto> now you try to retrieve your mess ?
[14:29:04] <nonconvergent> Is there channel for bootstrap anywhere? Maybe they'd know.
[14:29:16] <LindsayMac> disto: ok you gotta go away
[14:29:19] <duch_kazatel> nonconvergent yeah - i think it's #bootstrap.  i could be wrong though.
[14:29:31] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  give it a min. i havent looked yet
[14:29:51] <disto> i said god damn in good purpose. no offense given no taken.
[14:30:27] <nonconvergent> Mkay.
[14:30:55] <LindsayMac> arg.. mouse batts died.. brb
[14:34:28] <hassoon> alright, i wrote the piece of code in jfiddle you guys
[14:34:32] <hassoon> https://jsfiddle.net/vz8j4b6d/
[14:35:09] <disto> duch_kazatel : can I ask you something ?
[14:35:24] <hassoon> but the checkbox put in the thead doesn't make the other checkboxes in the rows follow it
[14:35:55] <disto> hey guys it's a general question
[14:36:01] <duch_kazatel> feel free to ask, disto
[14:36:15] <disto> I have a css class
[14:36:23] <duch_kazatel> hassoon you need to include jquery in that fiddle.
[14:36:33] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: ah
[14:36:38] <disto> the class name is ".12_years_old_littlegirl"
[14:36:48] <disto> cna I change it by jquery ?
[14:37:01] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  looking at your code.. does it not do exactly what you wanted it to?
[14:37:21] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  whenyou paste content into #baz, the TR previous to it is updated with .success
[14:37:27] <LindsayMac> as it the current one this
[14:37:34] <disto> can I change ".12_years_old_little_girl" css classname from jquery ?
[14:37:57] <LindsayMac> woop
[14:38:08] <nonconvergent> LindsayMac: Yes, but success should have a different color on the row.
[14:38:49] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  ohhh
[14:39:11] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  the TD is what is getting the color.. not the TR
[14:39:12] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: sorry about earlier, i thought you are some random kid saying whatever he has got in his mind
[14:39:27] <duch_kazatel> hassoon lol no need to apologize - you calmed down after the fact.
[14:39:29] <duch_kazatel> but thanks.
[14:39:35] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  and the .success is before .warning in the CSS (remember, it's CASCADING)
[14:39:39] <taplar> i've seen some kids do some wicked stuff on pcs
[14:39:50] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: but yeah the code works in jfiddle now after adding the jquery , not sure why it does not in my local file
[14:39:56] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  so you need to either REMOVE warning before adding SUCCESS or put an !important on the success class in your CSS
[14:40:32] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  http://cl.ly/image/0J3V2y3z0d2J
[14:41:13] <nonconvergent> LindsayMac: Okay, but I only added it to clearly show I was interested in the colors...let me try that, but I think it's still an issue if the tr has no class to begin with.
[14:41:36] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  no its not
[14:42:13] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  proof http://cl.ly/203a280n2N0C
[14:42:18] <nonconvergent> huh.
[14:42:24] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  its literally just a basic cascading styles issue
[14:42:29] <nonconvergent> ...then why isn't it working in my webapp?
[14:43:05] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  did you remove the warning class?
[14:44:00] <LindsayMac> hassoon: you have an error in your jsfiddle BTW
[14:44:01] <nonconvergent> LindsayMac: There's no warning class in the webapp...taking another look.
[14:44:13] <hassoon> LindsayMac: what is it :o
[14:44:37] <LindsayMac> hassoon: have a look in your console and you will see it
[14:45:09] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  not sure what to tell you.. the code you posted works in terms of adding the class and applying the class if the class="warning" isn't there.
[14:45:22] <LindsayMac> OR if you add !important to the BG color attribute in the td success class
[14:45:44] <taplar> ewww
[14:45:52] <LindsayMac> hassoon:  you didnt loading jquery
[14:46:00] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac you're way behind there ;)
[14:46:06] <LindsayMac> oh haha duch_kazatel
[14:46:10] <hassoon> LindsayMac: not sure what the errors mean, i just loaded the jquery script @ https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.js then reran the code successfully :o
[14:46:14] <kevg> hello winners
[14:46:22] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  was just rocking through all my tabs and saw that one was opened
[14:46:24] <kevg> is there anyway to use JavaScript / jQuery upload an image from a URL to an upload site's upload.php page?
[14:46:28] <nonconvergent> LindsayMac: Can I add that with jquery? I haven't done that before.
[14:46:29] <LindsayMac> hassoon:  ok nevermind
[14:46:35] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  huh????
[14:46:41] <duch_kazatel> kevg wut
[14:47:16] <kevg> duch_kazatel: there are sites like pomf.io
[14:47:39] <duch_kazatel> okay
[14:47:46] <kevg> duch_kazatel: i wanna be able to use javascript to make a chrome extension to quickly reupload images i find online to pomf
[14:48:08] <kevg> but idk if thats possible
[14:48:16] <duch_kazatel> that depends on whether or not they allow CORS./
[14:48:16] <LindsayMac> kevg:  you realize how poorly your initial question is asked when you actually ask the REAL question, right???
[14:48:25] <duch_kazatel> heh, LindsayMac it's all good :)
[14:48:26] <kevg> yea sorry english is my second language
[14:48:32] <taplar> does pomf only accept uploading of local files?
[14:48:47] <duch_kazatel> luckily: https://github.com/nokonoko/Pomf
[14:48:49] <kevg> taplar: yeah that si why im unsure if this is possible
[14:48:52] <duch_kazatel> looks like oyu can access the repo's sopurce.
[14:48:55] <duch_kazatel> *source
[14:49:12] <LindsayMac> I just can't understand people who ask "how can I upload an image" and then force you to poke for more info to find out theyre trying to make a browser extension for a specific service to conenct the two.. etc...
[14:49:15] <kevg> i tried lookin through the source but i'm a scrub and dont understand most of it
[14:49:27] <taplar> cause what your describing is more like your giving the endpoint a url and letting it do the fetch and store
[14:49:34] <kevg> LindsayMac: i am very sorry. is there anything i can do to make it up to you?
[14:49:51] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac when you've been staring at a problem for a while it's easy to forget that you have a bunch of context other people don't :)
[14:50:02] <duch_kazatel> kevg you're not really going to be able to do what you want.
[14:50:15] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: i guess.
[14:50:23] <duch_kazatel> though i might read through chrome extension tutorials and see what's up from there.
[14:50:40] <kevg> duch_kazatel: i see. so this is likely not possible?
[14:51:14] <duch_kazatel> kevg not that i can see.
[14:51:21] <duch_kazatel> but i've been wrong before.
[14:52:04] <taplar> it was a tuesday...
[14:52:09] <taplar> and clinton was in office...
[14:52:31] <plamb> is there a better way to decide whether or not to display two inputs vs one than if(dataset.children().size() > 2) here? -> http://jsfiddle.net/qdL2jt0z/
[14:52:54] <plamb> currently the children() of dataset's size() is changing when edit->save->edit is clicked
[14:53:36] <plamb> if you click the second edit button 3 times you'll see whats happening
[14:53:38] <LindsayMac> plamb:  sorry not following
[14:53:43] <duch_kazatel> plamb where am i looking?
[14:53:45] <duch_kazatel> that's a big fiddle.
[14:53:49] <plamb> i know :/
[14:53:54] <plamb> the 2nd edit button
[14:53:59] <plamb> cliock it once, save, click it again
[14:54:01] <LindsayMac> plamb:  i clicked it a bunch of times.. didnt have issue s
[14:54:04] <plamb> it displays one input instead of two
[14:54:07] <plamb> the 2nd time
[14:54:13] <LindsayMac> i never get two inputs
[14:54:20] <plamb> you might be clicking the first one
[14:54:36] <duch_kazatel> plamb fwiw https://api.jquery.com/size/
[14:54:40] <plamb> its because dataset.children().size() is changing
[14:54:41] <LindsayMac> Ogh wait yes I do.. i didnt notice the two. reloaded the page and now see that youve given context
[14:54:42] <duch_kazatel> might want to see the deprecation notice.
[14:55:07] <plamb> ill see if that changes anything
[14:55:16] <duch_kazatel> that won't change anything.
[14:55:20] <plamb> that feel
[14:55:22] <duch_kazatel> it's more like an aside.
[14:55:38] <plamb> i cant figure out what children().length would change
[14:55:41] <plamb> why*
[14:55:45] <duch_kazatel> right.
[14:55:49] <duch_kazatel> i just said that it won't :)
[14:56:15] <duch_kazatel> just pointing out .size() has been deprecated.
[14:56:18] <plamb> oh
[14:56:27] <LindsayMac> plamb:  you just have to make sure that when you save you take the values of the inputs separately
[14:56:49] <plamb> the html im returning probably literally has two children instead of 3
[14:57:18] <plamb> ya i think its because newvalCompany isnt wrapped in an <a>
[14:57:23] <plamb> like it is originally
[14:57:36] <nonconvergent> LindsayMac: Hmm, I think it has more to do with the makeup of this table.  For some reason the one I'm trying to work on is <table><thead><tr><th></th><td>...</td></tr></thead></table> I think the thead or the th might be the problem
[14:57:45] <LindsayMac> plamb: yea when you save the new stuff you have to save it with the same markup
[14:58:05] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  not likely.
[14:58:32] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  but without seeing your actual page its hard to say. Just look in the source code to see if the style is loaded and if so (i'm sure it is) how far down in the list of styles is it listed
[14:59:36] <ceramicskull> I'm trying to grab the length of how many li.color are there and add it with the .color-overflow so it returns one whole number, however, I'm hitting a brick wall: Any help would be appreciated http://jsfiddle.net/5ajwbnd8/2/
[15:00:01] <nonconvergent> LindsayMac: I'm not sure what to look for in it.
[15:00:16] <ceramicskull> The brick wall is pretty much grabbing what is .color-overflow
[15:00:21] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  look for .success class in the righthand bar of chrome web dev tools
[15:01:56] <taplar> ceramicskull: so that first block should result in 7?
[15:02:04] <LindsayMac> plamb:  what i would do is actually take your html elements that are meant to be turned into an input and give them each class names and identifiers that will match their input's names or identifiers.
[15:02:20] <ceramicskull> taplar: yes correct
[15:03:58] <taplar> ceramicskull: http://jsfiddle.net/5ajwbnd8/3/
[15:04:25] <plamb> how do i actually pass this string correctly
[15:04:26] <plamb> http://pastebin.com/TWkvaLTL
[15:04:49] <plamb> i think the problem is that comma
[15:05:21] <duch_kazatel> whaaaa
[15:05:31] <duch_kazatel> plamb you should lkooka t using a templating system.
[15:05:36] <taplar> ceramicskull: you want to do your finds in relation to which group your currently working on.  looking up the overflow as you were would find all of them
[15:05:50] <plamb> i use play framework
[15:06:01] <duch_kazatel> i've used play before, plamb
[15:06:02] <plamb> but i dont think i can turn those jquery values into scala values
[15:06:21] <duch_kazatel> it really looks like you need something client-side.
[15:06:50] <JosefDe> Hi guys
[15:07:01] <nonconvergent> LindsayMac: https://i.imgur.com/USuaVFE.png
[15:07:03] <JosefDe> How can I call .hide() on elements which are loaded afterwards?
[15:07:05] <JosefDe> via AJAX?
[15:07:10] <duch_kazatel> JosefDe use css instead.
[15:07:23] <duch_kazatel> JosefDe or call .hide() in the .done() callback.
[15:07:33] <JosefDe> duch_kazatel: If you use "display: none" with css, you can't show that item with show() any more
[15:07:38] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent: that doesnt help me really
[15:07:44] <duch_kazatel> JosefDe yes you can.
[15:07:49] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  not at all.. if you can give me a live link I would look but otherwise, this is too mcuh
[15:07:52] <plamb> ah i was missing a single quote
[15:07:59] <nonconvergent> LindsayMac: me either.
[15:08:04] <zumba_addict> Good afternoon folks. What does the $ 1st param do in apply?  $.when.apply($, this.promise).done(_.bind(function() { .... })
[15:08:08] <JosefDe> duch_kazatel: I tried. It didn't work. But let me try again
[15:08:16] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  you either what?
[15:08:26] <nonconvergent> Doesn't help me either.
[15:08:27] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict pass the context.
[15:08:40] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/rvjgofjc/ JosefDe
[15:08:42] <zumba_addict> kinda like bind?
[15:08:53] <JosefDe> duch_kazatel: You're really fast :)
[15:09:01] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[15:09:20] <zumba_addict> oh, thanks much
[15:09:23] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict deffo.
[15:09:26] <zumba_addict> i took it out, that's why it failed
[15:09:28] <nonconvergent> LindsayMac: I'm kind of groping around in the dark. I wish I could expose this to you for help, but I can't.
[15:09:29] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  it should.. you should be able to minimally understand the styles and cascading style sheets and how they work. its the BASICS of the internet
[15:09:37] <zumba_addict> i thought it was params
[15:10:06] <JosefDe> duch_kazatel: Perfect buddy
[15:10:42] <nonconvergent> LindsayMac: I thought I did.
[15:11:08] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  you n eed to get back to the drawing board in understanding CSS
[15:11:15] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  your issue is ENTIRELY css based
[15:15:40] <nonconvergent> LindsayMac: got it. it was the thead afterall.
[15:15:49] <LindsayMac> the thread?
[15:15:54] <nonconvergent> Dunno what that tag was there.
[15:15:54] <duch_kazatel> thead
[15:16:02] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac table head
[15:16:04] <nonconvergent> s/what/why/
[15:16:04] <b-ot> Correction, <nonconvergent> Dunno why that tag was there.
[15:16:44] <LindsayMac> nonconvergent:  still dont think it is.. its a css issue but you just patched it without really knowing how / why
[15:16:44] <nonconvergent> And I talked to the only person on my team who matters on it...he doesn't know either. So it's gone as fast as I can write the regex to search and replace it.
[15:16:56] <LindsayMac> wow.. that's quite a team
[15:17:02] <LindsayMac> what a mess
[15:17:09] <taplar> high bus factor
[15:17:23] <nonconvergent> That why they pay me the middle bucks.
[15:17:27] <taplar> lmao
[15:17:30] <duch_kazatel> D:
[15:17:30] <taplar> amen brother
[15:19:57] <zumba_addict> am I right folks that the "IF" statement is a waste of code since it's a promise? http://pastebin.com/9y508pkN
[15:20:12] <duch_kazatel> objects are truthy.
[15:20:47] <duch_kazatel> '', null, 0, undefined, false, NaN - those are your falsy values
[15:21:00] <zumba_addict> is that for me duch_kazatel?
[15:21:05] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[15:21:17] <zumba_addict> are you saying that I should keep the IF there?
[15:21:18] <duch_kazatel> everything else evaluates to truthy.  so depending on what you're doing, it might bne.
[15:21:26] <duch_kazatel> unless it's one of those 6 previously mentioned values.
[15:21:31] <zumba_addict> got it
[15:21:53] <zumba_addict> i'll put it back on :)
[15:21:57] <zumba_addict> thanks
[15:22:21] <nonconvergent> hmmm, looks like I spoke too soon
[15:22:22] <duch_kazatel> if you have the time, refactor so you're not calling that code unless there's a promise.
[15:22:52] <hassoon> the heck is wrong with this code :@
[15:22:58] <LindsayMac> everything
[15:23:12] <hassoon> event handlers are not working with checkbox buttons
[15:23:19] <hassoon> i mean the selectAll thing
[15:23:20] <duch_kazatel> ies
[15:23:23] <duch_kazatel> *lies
[15:23:33] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: wanna access my computer ? :D
[15:23:38] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle.
[15:24:03] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: yeah, in the fiddle it did worked as i showed before, but it does not in my computer :/
[15:24:11] <hassoon> *it did work *
[15:24:13] <zumba_addict> I'm thinking this code is safe since they are not executed at the same time, let me pastebin it
[15:24:41] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: seriously sir, you care to access my apache server? :o
[15:25:05] <duch_kazatel> hassoon make a fiddle.
[15:25:25] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: but i did :o  https://jsfiddle.net/vz8j4b6d/2/
[15:27:48] <duch_kazatel> fixingthesejquery.com
[15:28:03] <duch_kazatel> check your console, hassoon
[15:28:11] <zumba_addict> this is what I was thinking that is ok since I used this.promise for the 2 different ajax calls - http://pastebin.com/4uGRfX0U
[15:28:27] <zumba_addict> only one is executed and based from the device
[15:30:27] <duch_kazatel> ah
[15:32:00] <zumba_addict> am I right that it's safe?
[15:32:07] <zumba_addict> i know that other devs can get confused :)
[15:32:40] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: how can i debig that in firebug? :o  https://i.imgur.com/vACzedy.png
[15:32:43] <zumba_addict> if a user is browsing from his phone, the chance of it getting inside large screen is very very minimal
[15:33:11] <ceramicskull> taplar: Thanks! I got what I needed working :)
[15:33:18] <taplar> cool
[15:33:26] <ceramicskull> can't believe it was just using .find  :l
[15:33:30] <duch_kazatel> hassoon hit "all"
[15:34:12] <zumba_addict> i've done multiple test and I haven't seen it fail
[15:34:15] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: done, but i got an empty space :o
[15:34:23] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict as long as whatever your stuff is doing isn't better suited to be handled via media queries.
[15:34:30] <duch_kazatel> hassoon and you refreshed the page?
[15:34:31] <zumba_addict> yup
[15:34:37] <duch_kazatel> hassoon and you tried clicking?
[15:34:41] <zumba_addict> our media queries sucks
[15:34:46] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict er.
[15:34:54] <duch_kazatel> media queries are great.
[15:35:00] <zumba_addict> i can't even believe we are not using bootstrap or foundation
[15:35:38] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: yep, I refreshed the page, but still i got nothing :o  https://i.imgur.com/XFvtR9a.png
[15:35:48] <zumba_addict> i'm even shock the the jpeg is decided and pulled via ajax call
[15:36:08] <zumba_addict> that's why when I resize, nothing happens, LOL
[15:36:47] <JosefDe> duch_kazatel: toggling elements which have "display: none" in css, is not working.. The elements are not shown. Any idea, why?
[15:37:30] <NoiseEee> fiddle, JosefDe, come on
[15:37:34] <JosefDe> ok
[15:38:59] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: in fact, i even did $("input[name=all_client]").click(function(){alert('hey')});  but i didn't get any alert box when i clicked on the checkbox, doesn't that mean that the piece of code in-question wasn't acessed in the first place ?
[15:39:29] <taplar> or your trying to bind too soon
[15:39:47] <duch_kazatel> hassoon first off: use classes, not attribute selectors.  second off, make sure you're in a doc reayd.
[15:39:51] <duch_kazatel> unless you're ajaxing stuff in.
[15:39:57] <duch_kazatel> in which case you need to use delegation.
[15:40:00] <taplar> and it's better to do $('input[name="all_client"]') if your going to do that
[15:40:23] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: sure thing, the piece of code is wrapped in a doc ready function, along with other blocs of codes
[15:40:43] <duch_kazatel> hassoon is this form dynamically created somehow?
[15:41:09] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: yeah, the table is generated from the DB with php, if that counts :o
[15:41:17] <duch_kazatel> i mean via js.
[15:41:21] <duch_kazatel> or if ajax is involved.
[15:41:43] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: ah surely not, just a traditional webpage without any ajax/dynamic code
[15:41:49] <duch_kazatel> try using a delegated listener on document.
[15:41:52] <duch_kazatel> see what happens there.
[15:41:58] <duch_kazatel> if it's still broken, then you've got a bad selector.
[15:42:08] <LindsayMac> is the person who was having the issue with counting the number of children in a <UL> with 'color' classes still here?
[15:42:12] * hassoon googles  delegated listener
[15:42:21] <duch_kazatel> hassoon http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[15:42:23] <duch_kazatel> read the whole thing.
[15:42:34] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: okey
[15:42:36] <duch_kazatel> there are two code examples - the second one is more pertinent to what you want.
[15:47:09] * nonconvergent got it
[15:47:18] <nonconvergent> Woo. Thanks duch_kazatel and LindsayMac
[15:48:55] <hassoon> what the.. after removing the jquery tablesorter plugin's <script> lines, the selectAll function worked :o
[15:49:03] <hassoon> how could that interfere with this
[15:50:22] <duch_kazatel> "selectAll"?
[15:50:37] <duch_kazatel> and i'll bet you needed a delegated listener instead.
[15:50:44] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: yeah, i mean the piece of jquery code i wrote in the fiddle earlier
[15:53:19] <LindsayMac> No .?? no one claiming the math with color buttons as their problem?
[15:53:41] <hassoon> LindsayMac: what ? :v
[15:53:58] <LindsayMac> someone was having an issue relating to counting child elements
[15:54:19] <hassoon> .length can help i guess
[15:55:06] <LindsayMac> hassoon:  omg.. i am not asking for help. I'm just asking if the person in here who asked about this peroblem is still here
[15:55:21] <hassoon> LindsayMac: omg!
[15:55:49] <LindsayMac> hassoon:  you're kind of failing at reading comprehension, sir
[15:57:18] <hassoon> LindsayMac: maybe i should change my parser :o
[15:59:02] <LindsayMac> yea maybe
[15:59:07] <hassoon> :v
[16:06:58] <LindsayMac> well whatever. if anyone was playing with that. Got part of the way there http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/5ajwbnd8/13/
[16:07:36] <LindsayMac> plamb:  i think it was you
[16:07:49] <LindsayMac> its messy
[16:08:56] <plamb> wot
[16:09:10] <plamb> my issue was just with not returning the html i thought i was returning
[16:09:36] <LindsayMac> plamb:  ok then it wasnt you.
[16:12:37] <PurePandemonium> it was ceramicskull
[16:16:24] <JosefDe> Hey guys. How can I toggle an html-element, which is hidden via "display: none;" in css?
[16:16:50] <NoiseEee> .show() and .hide()
[16:17:23] <duch_kazatel> JosefDe we went over this earlier.
[16:17:41] <duch_kazatel> i even provided an example that disproved your theory :)
[16:17:45] <NoiseEee> JosefDe: what happened to that fiddle you were going to create?

[16:40:17] <grimgrinn> all things is included!
[16:40:26] <grimgrinn> yeah
[16:40:31] <duch_kazatel> dunno then.,
[16:40:34] <duch_kazatel> i don't hjave a crystal ball ;)
[16:41:18] <grimgrinn> strange things is going all - once its have to work but after f5 its doesnt
[16:41:26] <grimgrinn> i just donnu uderstand!
[16:41:36] <RDash> Apparently IE on Windows XP kills himself including a whole network
[16:41:37] <duch_kazatel> are you loading jquery more than once?
[16:41:46] <RDash> when loading specific JQuery requests :|
[16:41:48] <grimgrinn> some kind of black magic is going on
[16:41:58] <duch_kazatel> RDash huh?
[16:42:05] <plamb> why is the <img> coming back when i press "save" ?
[16:42:07] <plamb> http://jsfiddle.net/httm911c/
[16:42:50] <duch_kazatel> plamb that's a bad way to handle bindings btw.
[16:42:55] <duch_kazatel> don't bind inside of another binding.
[16:42:58] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you'll stack things.
[16:43:10] <grimgrinn> you know, site is running by bootstrap framework. in very beginning i used to cnnect jquery from google.
[16:43:13] <plamb> okay
[16:43:18] <plamb> so it should be outside
[16:43:28] <duch_kazatel> grimgrinn no way for me to know without seeing the issue.
[16:44:00] <duch_kazatel> grimgrinn please don't PM me.
[16:44:08] <duch_kazatel> ask here in the channel.
[16:44:27] <duch_kazatel> grimgrinn please stop PMing me.
[16:44:38] <RDash> duch_kazatel, well my work has a poor security (Windows XP and IE6 Fricking every were!). Tried to open a friends page with a webm video that gets cached temporarly when visiting trough NGINX. It caused the whole network to fail and put down the entire office.
[16:45:03] <duch_kazatel> RDash do other browsers fail?
[16:45:16] <RDash> At home I´ve checked the source and there´s nothing wrong with it, its just a HTML5 player with a JQuery backend for Android and iPhone
[16:45:28] <duch_kazatel> "jQuery backend"?
[16:45:29] <RDash> duch_kazatel, well whole network was down so idk :|
[16:45:39] <duch_kazatel> RDash that sounds like something else is at fault.
[16:45:40] <grimgrinn> all in all everything is connecting right but magneficpopup dosent work and beating an error
[16:46:19] <RDash> duch_kazatel, idk it was funny to see every one sweating :P
[16:46:21] <duch_kazatel> grimgrinn the error is because you're either loading jquery twice or you're running your code before the plugin loads.
[16:46:32] <duch_kazatel> grimgrinn or you're not even loading the plugin in the first place.
[16:49:20] <grimgrinn> guys i already know it all.. everythongs of you tell about is right
[16:49:26] <grimgrinn> you can check it
[16:49:27] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: your suggested article was good, yet it that was my issue basically https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/541
[16:49:38] <hassoon> *yet that *
[16:49:43] <duch_kazatel> grimgrinn share the page out to the channel.

[17:01:00] <plamb> http://jsfiddle.net/httm911c/1/
[17:01:06] <plamb> can you tell me why the image isnt coming back
[17:01:21] <grimgrinn> what the fuck with this o/i )
[17:01:40] <plamb> the new html it inserts includes
[17:01:42] <plamb> <img src="'+newval+'" width="200" height="200" />
[17:01:49] <taplar> hold on, i'm looking
[17:01:52] <plamb> thanks
[17:02:34] <grimgrinn> how are you guys going?
[17:02:42] <grimgrinn> whats happing?
[17:03:00] <taplar> plamb so what's the intended functionality?
[17:03:01] <grimgrinn> have not using morc for more then 7 years
[17:03:06] <plamb> well
[17:03:15] <plamb> if you dont edit anything in the input
[17:03:21] <plamb> it should just display the picture again
[17:03:25] <plamb> when you hit the save buttoin
[17:03:28] <grimgrinn> really cool that somth still going here )
[17:03:43] <n0f3> hi all, if I have a list item declared such as <li><a href="#"><img class="profile-image" src=""></a></li>, I'm trying to then modify href and src through jquery, but I'm not sure i'm doing it correcty with: $('#people:nth-child({0})'.format(index)).find('<a>').attr('href')); any ideas how I can achieve that?
[17:03:51] <plamb> or, display any picture link you put into the input
[17:04:22] <taplar> plamb so on edit, allow the image url to change, and on save display whatever url was given?
[17:04:28] <plamb> yes exactly
[17:04:31] <taplar> k
[17:04:34] <plamb> but as the src in an <img>''
[17:04:48] <taplar> right right
[17:04:59] <taplar> i want you to try something
[17:05:03] <plamb> o-okay
[17:05:39] <taplar> instead of destroying the elements, try hiding the image and showing the text input.  then on the save, change your image, hide your input and reshow your image
[17:06:54] <plamb> i will
[17:07:03] <taplar> cool, see what you can come up with, :)
[17:07:05] <plamb> out of curiosity i'd still like to know why the current code isnt working
[17:07:13] <plamb> unless thats the reason
[17:08:07] <taplar> i'll look more while you tinker
[17:10:12] <taplar> well one thing i don't believe your sibling selector for picedit will work
[17:10:34] <taplar> as your going off of .savepic, .picEdit is not a sibling
[17:10:34] <plamb> why's that
[17:10:51] <plamb> on document load its not a sibling
[17:10:52] <plamb> true
[17:10:57] <plamb> however, .top is
[17:11:05] <plamb> not a sibling, but is there on page load
[17:11:12] <taplar> well hold on, i may be wrong about that
[17:11:23] <taplar> lol, having a bit of trouble visualizing, :)
[17:12:13] <taplar> nvm it is finding it
[17:12:59] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: yay thank you, now it works
[17:13:07] <hassoon> i used the delegated event method
[17:18:58] <plamb> show/hide is working tho my input isnt working anymore
[17:19:06] <plamb> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/httm911c/2/
[17:19:31] <plamb> i guess i could show/hide the input too
[17:19:50] <taplar> yeah
[17:21:31] <ceramicskull> LindsayMac: Hey thanks for that! I had figured it out with the help of Taplar earlier.
[17:26:19] <plamb> is it possible to change multiple attributes in .attr()
[17:26:34] <taplar> i don't believe it is
[17:26:42] <plamb> so you just chain them together
[17:26:49] <taplar> yep
[17:27:29] <plamb> works: http://jsfiddle.net/httm911c/3/
[17:27:37] <plamb> i wish the tutorial i'd gone off of had used show/hide
[17:27:41] <plamb> so much simpler
[17:28:24] <taplar> :), it could be a bit smaller to probably
[17:28:41] <plamb> yeah i bet
[17:30:30] <grimgrinn> you guys are great! i so love mirc! power of senergity here
[17:30:36] <grimgrinn> see ya latar guys
[17:30:40] <grimgrinn> thak you
[17:30:47] <grimgrinn> thank you
[17:33:16] <ceramicskull> irc has taught me more about programming than the internet has... A physical teacher is always better than reading.
[17:37:42] <duch_kazatel> boom
[17:40:08] <taplar> plamb, take a looksie at this for an alternative http://jsfiddle.net/httm911c/4/
[17:40:34] <plamb> such short
[17:41:00] <plamb> with no <a>'s
[17:41:02] <plamb> d-damn
[17:41:05] <taplar> no need
[17:41:09] <duch_kazatel> could just use $(this) inside those handlers.
[17:41:19] <duch_kazatel> if you have multiple .top things you're talking with.
[17:41:28] <taplar> true
[17:41:32] <duch_kazatel> though i will point out one little nitpick.,
[17:41:55] <duch_kazatel> $top.find('#profilepic')
[17:42:03] <taplar> lol, yeah...
[17:42:07] <duch_kazatel> just do $('#profilepic')
[17:42:17] <plamb> ya cuz its an id
[17:42:20] <duch_kazatel> sui
[17:42:21] <duch_kazatel> *si
[17:44:17] <taplar> heh, the profilepic is kinda the odd child being the only id there
[17:44:24] <duch_kazatel> ^
[17:44:31] <duch_kazatel> i'd clean up the markup and make that a class.
[17:47:04] <plamb> now i just gotta generalize this to a .top with multiple .edit's
[17:51:35] <taplar> little more generic http://jsfiddle.net/httm911c/5/
[17:51:54] <duch_kazatel> boom.
[17:52:37] <plamb> why'd you wrap stuff in span's ?
[17:52:47] <taplar> one selector vs two
[17:53:07] <taplar> also provides some context for the two parts
[17:53:07] <plamb> is that a better principle over easiest-to-read-html
[17:53:23] <duch_kazatel> did the markup before not have the spans?
[17:53:25] <plamb> maybe this version is easier to read
[17:53:27] <plamb> no
[17:53:27] <taplar> nope
[17:53:29] <duch_kazatel> because i find this easier to understand.
[17:53:39] <duch_kazatel> semantically, at least.
[17:54:59] <plamb> now i gotta edit all my css :)
[17:55:06] <plamb> that feel
[17:55:17] <taplar> hey, if another way is easier for you to read, go for it.  we're not the ones that will be maintaining it, :)
[17:55:47] <plamb> if this allows me to write one small chunk of jquery to manage all the edit buttons
[17:56:00] <plamb> like you see here
[17:56:01] <plamb> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/pdaom92e/
[17:56:05] <plamb> then its prob worth it
[17:56:49] <taplar> oh, well that block is kinda expecting an image
[17:56:56] <plamb> right
[17:57:00] <plamb> but could it be generalized you think
[17:57:00] <taplar> so in that aspect it's still coupled tightly
[17:57:06] <taplar> but you could fix that with a class
[17:57:35] <taplar> and you'll have to distinguish based off of class to know if you use .prop('src') or just .text() or whatever
[17:57:42] <plamb> right
[17:57:59] <taplar> might be better to have different handlers for the different types though
[17:58:05] <plamb> you think
[17:58:06] <taplar> like
[17:58:14] <taplar> make that one .save-image, .edit-image
[17:58:21] <taplar> make another .save-text, .edit-text
[17:58:40] <plamb> could i still handle all of it in one jquery block?
[17:58:49] <plamb> or would i need two separate <script>'s
[17:58:54] <taplar> no no
[17:59:01] <duch_kazatel> plamb you have this in a js file, right?
[17:59:09] * plamb glances around nervously
[17:59:09] <taplar> nothing that i can think of forces you to use muliple scripts
[17:59:35] <duch_kazatel> plamb D: put these in one file.
[17:59:41] <duch_kazatel> a single .js file.
[17:59:53] * plamb coughs, looks at watch "oh shit i gotta be somewhere"
[17:59:56] * plamb runs
[18:00:00] <taplar> lol
[18:00:01] <duch_kazatel> noooooooooooo
[18:11:30] <ceramicskull> taplar: is there a reason why I can't use .before instead of append when using $.get
[18:11:40] <duch_kazatel> wut
[18:11:51] <taplar> insertBefore?
[18:11:56] <ceramicskull> Oh yea
[18:11:58] <ceramicskull> ...
[18:12:08] <taplar> or .prepend
[18:12:12] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/before/
[18:12:22] <ceramicskull> prepend won't work, but yea insertBefore was what I was looking for...
[18:12:29] <duch_kazatel> there's a .before() fwiw
[18:12:42] <taplar> huh, same as insertBefore?
[18:12:49] <ceramicskull> yea I know, but when I use it in a $.get situation it doesn't really do anything
[18:13:01] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[18:13:44] <ceramicskull> Like I'm trying to add some divs from a different page into a current page to test something and when I try to include it into the html structure using .before() it just never shows up
[18:13:55] <duch_kazatel> what are you targeting?
[18:14:20] <duch_kazatel> $('.someElement').before('<span>foo</span>');
[18:14:23] <ceramicskull> the class I'm trying to include it before.
[18:14:42] <ceramicskull> insertBefore works better
[18:14:42] <duch_kazatel> like, that'll function, regardless of where you're running it from.
[18:14:59] <duch_kazatel> oh, you're flipping your arguments, that's why.
[18:15:07] <ceramicskull> ^
[18:15:18] <duch_kazatel> err, your selector vs content.
[18:15:29] <ceramicskull> Well both true lol
[18:15:34] <duch_kazatel> not really.
[18:15:47] <ceramicskull> sorry, I'm loopy atm, just had my wisdom tooth removed and trying to work on vicodin ._ .
[18:16:11] <taplar> sick day man!
[18:16:56] <taplar> though..... that statement combined with your alias is kinda funny
[18:18:42] <plamb> taplar the way the chained the .on onto the first bind
[18:18:49] <plamb> what does that do/mean
[18:18:58] <plamb> }).on('click', '.save', function() {
[18:19:01] <taplar> .on() returns the element it operated on
[18:19:07] <taplar> so you can chain
[18:19:15] <plamb> so it just looks for 'save' in .top
[18:19:34] <taplar> no, it looks for click events that bubbled up to it, originating from and element with class save
[18:19:50] <plamb> when you chain like that you need to use two semi colons at the end?
[18:19:56] <taplar> nope
[18:20:44] <plamb> o-oh
[18:20:46] <plamb> why did you
[18:20:49] <plamb> or did i do that
[18:20:54] <taplar> uh
[18:20:58] <plamb> http://jsfiddle.net/httm911c/5/
[18:21:17] <duch_kazatel> small syntactic error somewhere.
[18:21:18] <duch_kazatel> nbd.\
[18:21:30] <taplar> ah, haha, sorry, yeah i did that, my  bad
[18:23:35] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/httm911c/6/  there.  leading $top wasn't needed either
[18:25:11] <taplar> duch_kazatel, still a syntax error?
[18:28:48] <plamb> taplar: heres my first attempt: http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/pdaom92e/2/
[18:28:50] <plamb> :x
[18:29:13] <duch_kazatel> missing semis all over the place.
[18:29:23] <taplar> careful with the class names, some people are at work
[18:29:30] <plamb> oh yeah
[18:29:31] <plamb> my b
[18:29:32] <plamb> lol
[18:29:59] <taplar> and i'm not a fan of .find('.bull...') ;)
[18:30:06] <plamb> needless to say
[18:30:11] <plamb> i was mad at CSS when i wrote that class
[18:30:16] <plamb> updated
[18:30:17] <plamb> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/pdaom92e/2/
[18:30:42] <duch_kazatel> taplar why?
[18:30:53] <taplar> you like to find bs? heh
[18:30:56] <plamb> its messed up of course, need to work on how i grab the contents of of the blocks i think
[18:30:59] <duch_kazatel> oh that part.
[18:31:14] <taplar> i think that's the same link plamb
[18:31:26] <plamb> i changed it to bs
[18:31:31] <plamb> instead of That Other Word
[18:32:09] <taplar> lol
[18:32:17] <taplar> $bs = $('.bull....')
[18:32:25] <duch_kazatel> we know what word it is ;)
[18:32:27] <taplar> cracking me up
[18:32:32] <plamb> lol
[18:32:51] <taplar> anyway, lets see
[18:33:03] <taplar> does it work?
[18:33:18] <plamb> nah i need to console log some stuff and see whats happening
[18:33:25] <plamb> just showing you the first draft
[18:33:33] <taplar> i clicked the edit on the image and the whole thing went away
[18:33:38] <plamb> ya
[18:35:28] <taplar> oh
[18:35:41] <taplar> your bs div is a child of the top div
[18:35:48] <taplar> it should be another top div itself
[18:42:55] <taplar> n0f3, you still here?
[18:46:08] <taplar> btw you mentioned north carolina earlier duch_kazatel , you still live there?
[18:46:14] <duch_kazatel> california
[18:46:20] <duch_kazatel> not carolina
[18:46:27] <taplar> i thought i remembered you mentioning cali before
[18:46:39] <duch_kazatel> yep, same story today :)
[18:49:03] <taplar> saw a small band on saturday that was touring from cali
[18:49:11] <duch_kazatel> what band?
[18:49:17] <taplar> good graeff?
[18:49:38] <duch_kazatel> you mean grief?
[18:49:48] <taplar> nope
[18:49:48] <duch_kazatel> and never heard of 'em.
[18:49:51] <duch_kazatel> weird.
[18:50:12] <taplar> yeah, small band.  i found some of their stuff on youtube that sounded ok.  personally i liked them better in person.  more procussions
[18:50:46] <duch_kazatel> i don't get out to enough concerts these days.
[18:50:55] <duch_kazatel> there are very few acts i'd want to see live any more so meh.
[18:51:23] <Kamuela> where in cali duch_kazatel
[18:51:26] <taplar> i never get out.  just some family wanted to spend time together, and I don't have s*** to talk about, so hey, lets watch some music together, ^_^
[18:51:32] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela Chico
[18:51:44] <Kamuela> duch_kazatel: oh shit, an old friend is from there. cool stuff
[18:51:51] <duch_kazatel> nice.
[18:52:11] <Kamuela> I was born in the bay area but ended up living most of my life in Hawaii
[18:52:21] <duch_kazatel> where at in the bay area?
[18:52:29] <Sal> hi
[18:52:30] <Kamuela> alameda, does that still count as bay?
[18:52:34] <taplar> that sounded strangely past tense in terms of your life
[18:52:36] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela hell yeah it does.
[18:52:53] <duch_kazatel> my stepmom's sister lives in alameda.
[18:52:56] <Kamuela> lol taplar, well I’m in the UK now
[18:52:56] <Sal> how can i know if the i click the yellow or the red? http://jsfiddle.net/fqxjc7aa/7/
[18:53:09] <Sal> i thought that the event could tell me it in someway
[18:53:22] <duch_kazatel> Sal $(this) is the thing you clicked.
[18:53:23] <Sal> but i can't find the right function
[18:53:32] <Sal> oh
[18:53:33] <Kamuela> I’m honestly not sure if I have any family left in Alameda… My dad’s side are rather old
[18:53:42] <Sal> not e.currentTarget ?
[18:53:49] <duch_kazatel> Sal you could use that, too.
[18:53:51] <duch_kazatel> either/or.
[18:54:00] <duch_kazatel> and use console.log(), not alert9)
[18:54:05] <duch_kazatel> *alert()
[18:54:14] <Sal> yes, but how can i check if i clicked on div.fore or div.back ?
[18:54:21] <Kamuela> I feel like I’ve spent so much time with vanilla JS in this app when I should have Just Fucking Used jQuery™
[18:54:35] <taplar> $(this).hasClass('fore')
[18:54:43] <duch_kazatel> Sal wut
[18:54:50] <duch_kazatel> what are you actually trying to accomplish?
[18:54:53] <Sal> the hasClass with currentTarget gives me error
[18:54:57] <Sal> why's that?
[18:55:20] <taplar> or better yet, make two different handlers for the two classes, :)
[18:55:53] <Sal> thats a small sample of a backfrop (red) with a popup (yellow) and a close button (blue)
[18:55:59] <duch_kazatel> Sal it's $(e.currentTarget).hasClass();
[18:56:08] <Sal> oh
[18:56:20] <Dr-007> what do you guys recommend to clear a file input? online i read <input type=file /> is readonly after selecting the file in >= IE8, for security reasons. but i find solutions online to bypass that by cloning the file input and replaceWith().
[18:56:25] <Sal> i passed that the $target
[18:56:32] <duch_kazatel> Dr-007 then do that.
[18:56:49] <Sal> but if i do $target.hasClass i get error
[18:56:56] <duch_kazatel> show us what you mean.
[18:57:03] <Dr-007> do you think i it works 24/7?
[18:57:14] <duch_kazatel> Dr-007 i'd have to do what you did :)
[18:57:14] <taplar> o.O
[18:57:35] <Sal> anyway, i just want to close popup clicking on the blue div (close button) or on the red div (backdrop)
[18:57:58] <Sal> now, even if i click on the yellow (popup panel), it closes, and it shouldn't
[18:58:02] <Dr-007> allright, ill implement it then
[18:58:02] <duch_kazatel> Sal so use a delegated listener for a class on the close button anda class on that backdrop.
[18:58:14] <Sal> ?
[18:58:19] <duch_kazatel> Sal you'll need to do a e.stopPropagation() call in that delegated listener.
[18:58:40] <Sal> you mean add another listener for the yello div?
[18:58:44] <duch_kazatel> no.
[18:58:50] <Sal> i want ed to avoid that , just to not add more codeù
[18:58:52] <duch_kazatel> actually yes.
[18:58:57] <duch_kazatel> sorry - you WILL need that.
[18:59:22] <Sal> so there's no way in the event to know if i clicked yellow or red?
[18:59:29] <taplar> yeah, otherwise the event from the yellow will bubble up through the red
[18:59:41] <duch_kazatel> Sal there's a much easier way to handle this.
[19:00:02] <Sal> duch_kazatel, could you please show me it in my jsfiddle?
[19:00:14] <Sal> i have no idea how
[19:00:17] <duch_kazatel> i'll help you write it yourself :)
[19:00:23] <Sal> ok
[19:00:42] <Sal> tell me then
[19:00:49] <Sal> whats the easy way to do it
[19:01:04] <duch_kazatel> so the way we described before it the "smart" way to do it.
[19:01:07] <duch_kazatel> that makes it really clear.
[19:01:38] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, you can bind a general listener on $(document) and see if e.target is the backdrop OR if e.target is the close button.
[19:02:07] <duch_kazatel> you could also need to check if e.target is contained in the modal and run stopPropagation against the event.
[19:03:26] <Sal> yes, but i don't know nothing about delegates (is that the term you used before) ?
[19:03:40] <duch_kazatel> you were already using delegated listeners.
[19:03:45] <taplar> ^
[19:03:46] <duch_kazatel> but you don't need one in this case/.
[19:04:00] <Sal> ok, i'm at the start
[19:04:12] <Sal> i just know what i knew when i first came here
[19:04:37] <Sal> so, the besta way is to check hasClass() ?
[19:04:58] <Sal> s/besta/best/
[19:04:59] <b-ot> Correction, <Sal> so, the best way is to check hasClass() ?
[19:05:13] <duch_kazatel> the best way is to basically do what you had before and add another event listener.
[19:06:05] <Sal> only 1 more event listener would be enough? what if i add some components inside the yellow?
[19:06:38] <duch_kazatel> the extra listener is "on the yellow" and would simply run stopPropagation() against the click event.
[19:07:07] <Sal> ok, thanks
[19:07:18] <taplar> would he not need to change the binding on the blue to not be a delegate then?
[19:07:22] <duch_kazatel> this way your code is clear and isn't up to weirdo tricks.
[19:07:23] <Sal> its seems more as a patch, but if its the only way, ok
[19:07:24] <Sal> thanks
[19:07:30] <duch_kazatel> Sal again
[19:07:33] <duch_kazatel> it's not the only way.
[19:07:36] <duch_kazatel> but it's the smart way.
[19:07:40] <Sal> :)
[19:07:42] <Sal> thanks
[19:07:47] <duch_kazatel> and taplar that's why you stopPropagaion() against the event,
[19:08:00] <duch_kazatel> Sal any other solution gets into cutesy hacks and weirdo logic.
[19:08:05] <duch_kazatel> let your code be clear about what you're doing.
[19:08:15] <Sal> ok
[19:08:17] <Sal> righht
[19:08:21] <Sal> -h
[19:08:48] * Sal doesn't know how the heck he typed 2 times h
[19:09:02] <taplar> skillfully
[19:09:42] <Sal> It is worrying
[19:10:11] <Sal> or it could be my $29 dollar microsoft keyboard
[19:10:36] <duch_kazatel> nah.
[19:10:39] <taplar> i like mine, and my ms mouse, :P
[19:10:53] <duch_kazatel> i have an ancient microsoft keyboard and it's still going strong.  i've abused it a lot, too.
[19:11:13] <Sal> at the end, microsoft is only selling devices
[19:11:19] <duch_kazatel> and services.
[19:11:27] <duch_kazatel> everything else is basically free at this point.
[19:11:36] <Sal> i wonder what happen to my first love visual studio + mssql
[19:11:44] <duch_kazatel> still going stron.
[19:11:52] <duch_kazatel> *strong - really popular if you have the money to run it.
[19:11:59] <taplar> i was going to get a fancy keyboard with lots of function keys for gaming, but then i realized i could autohotkey the numpad for stuff with the num lock on/off, and then my ms mouse has a thumb and pinkie button, so enough hotkeys and buttons for me
[19:13:07] <Sal> taplar: thats a spaceship controller!
[19:13:17] <taplar> heh
[19:13:26] <duch_kazatel> i have one of those logitech g-series keyboards.
[19:13:30] <duch_kazatel> it's alright.
[19:13:37] <taplar> the one with the lcd display?
[19:13:41] <duch_kazatel> yeah
[19:13:43] <taplar> i like those
[19:13:46] <duch_kazatel> not the color one.
[19:13:55] <duch_kazatel> i think i'm going to swap it for something else when i can though.
[19:14:18] <Sal> i had a first series (ibm ps/2 like) noisy click keyboard
[19:14:44] <duch_kazatel> a model m?
[19:14:53] <taplar> some of the guys at work got custom keyboards which they love, but they're clicky as h***.
[19:15:09] <duch_kazatel> taplar you can say "hell" - it's okay :)
[19:15:21] <taplar> lol, i'm trying to be good
[19:15:24] <hassoon> cute
[19:15:29] <duch_kazatel> we know what you meant ;)
[19:15:35] <Sal> don't know the model. it was with my old ps/2 55s
[19:15:39] <hassoon> taplar: be you son
[19:15:56] <Sal> http://www.9999hp.net/keyboard/temp/1391406-big.jpg
[19:16:31] <duch_kazatel> looks like a model m.
[19:16:31] <taplar> yeah!  floppy disk days!
[19:16:58] <Sal> when you type with that one, it seems that you're working in a cage full of woodpeckers)
[19:17:22] <taplar> oh man, that takes me all the way back to lab
[19:17:32] <duch_kazatel> Sal hah, i have coworkers with mechanicals - my keyboard manages to be louder.
[19:17:42] <Sal> hehe
[19:17:58] <taplar> playing some number crunchers, orgeon trail
[19:18:06] <duch_kazatel> *number munchers
[19:18:10] <duch_kazatel> please and thank you
[19:18:12] <taplar> what evs, lol
[19:18:34] <taplar> there was also a fish one that was fun
[19:19:47] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah i hate days like today
[19:19:58] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: what's bad about today
[19:20:08] <taplar> he wants to play some orgeon trail
[19:20:16] <Sal> i just loved adventures like indiana jones, loom, monkey island, etc
[19:20:39] <Sal> ok, break over. back to work
[19:20:42] <Sal> thanks for the help
[19:20:44] <Sal> se eya guys
[19:20:47] <duch_kazatel> i have to go through our flagship site's header and test what's being tracked in it.  then do the exact same thing over in our new platform.
[19:21:03] <taplar> :/
[19:21:19] <duch_kazatel> critical that we get it right, which is why i'm doing it.  but still mind numbing.
[19:22:07] <taplar> you talking about analytics?
[19:22:22] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[19:24:20] <duch_kazatel> omniture all over the place.
[20:28:33] <ph88> how do i use .on  like it is  .live ?
[20:28:43] <duch_kazatel> by using the delegated syntax for it.
[20:29:17] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/live/ shows you how.
[20:29:47] <ph88> sorry that was just one google away http://stackoverflow.com/a/9422110
[20:30:05] <duch_kazatel> avoid binding to document, fwiw.
[20:30:34] <ph88> i don't have any other solution for the moment
[20:30:43] <ph88> maybe bind to body ...
[20:30:46] <duch_kazatel> does the element get created in the root of the page?
[20:31:01] <ph88> don't think so
[20:31:07] <duch_kazatel> then you could bind lower :)
[20:31:23] <ph88> ok but everything is controller by virtual dom
[20:31:44] <duch_kazatel> should be fine, but okay.
[20:31:46] <ph88> so if i bind it lower then i don't know if that is going to be removed or not
[20:32:04] <ph88> there is no guarantee
[20:32:11] <ph88> since i don't control the DOM directly
[20:32:13] <duch_kazatel> that sounds wrong, but okay.
[20:32:24] <ph88> wrong ?
[20:32:29] <duch_kazatel> are you using react?
[20:33:13] <ph88> no, but similar
[20:33:23] <duch_kazatel> what're you using then?
[20:33:55] <ph88> https://github.com/evancz/virtual-dom
[20:34:03] <duch_kazatel> so not similar at all :)
