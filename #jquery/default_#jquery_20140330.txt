[00:32:24] <Snoopal> hey guys. is there a way to trigger a function on several events? $('foo').on('event1 event2',...) ?
[00:37:02] <sahbeewah> yeah that is exactly how you do it
[00:37:47] <Snoopal> oh cool!
[00:37:48] <Snoopal> thanks :)
[01:06:00] <devesh> hi i am getting POST 500 (Internal Server Error)
[01:06:18] <Guest97695> devesh: Posting to your own server?
[01:06:35] <devesh> yes
[01:07:06] <devesh> its works fine in localhost but in server getting error
[01:07:07] <Guest97695> devesh: Most likely you have some syntax errors there
[01:07:59] <Snoopal> or maybe your handling script does not handle the request correctly on the non localhost machine?
[01:08:55] <LoneStar99> devesh: you sending an ajax request to backend web server?
[01:08:55] <devesh> i am sending data through ajax post method and using serialize function
[01:10:01] <devesh> yes its simply a login form. i hecked a lot but cannot find any syntax error
[01:10:19] <Guest97695> devesh: Its the exact same code on the server as your localhost?
[01:10:50] <devesh> yes its same
[01:11:48] <LoneStar99> it seems it is a backend issue...
[01:12:25] <Guest97695> what language is being run on your backend ?
[01:12:29] <LoneStar99> you passing to php?
[01:13:14] <devesh> php
[01:13:37] <Guest97695> have you turn on error log messages?`
[01:13:40] <LoneStar99> devesh: you need to test it on another machine -> https://www.pozr.in
[01:14:09] <devesh> yes it show 500 internal server erro
[01:14:41] <devesh> and pointing error on this line of jquery xhr.send( ( s.hasContent && s.data ) || null );
[01:16:15] <LoneStar99> is it only the jquery file and php?
[01:16:46] <devesh> yes both
[01:17:22] <Snoopal> what do you get when you call the php file in browser ?
[01:17:47] <devesh> i have a question when we post data.. can form also send the value of submit type?
[01:20:00] <LoneStar99> if you want email me your files, I can upload them to one of my accounts and see it I get the same errors
[01:20:51] <LoneStar99> to me it sounds like a web server or php config issue...
[01:21:15] <devesh> if i am sending data using serialize method, i cant get the value of submit type everytime it showing blank
[01:22:23] <LoneStar99> devesh very difficult to diagnose, without the code...
[01:22:43] <devesh> yes may be its config issue
[01:23:21] <devesh> thanks all of you let me check once again
[01:23:40] <LoneStar99> i would recommend, upload files to another hosting service and if it works, then it is config issue with your dev environment
[01:24:16] <LoneStar99> if you need a free php, jquery, testing environment try -> https://www.pozr.in
[01:45:47] <Varun_Krishna> Hi guys how do I change the themes in JqueryMobile 1.4.2.
[02:16:46] <And1> Clicking on a link in my navigation triggers $.ajax(url) to insert/load the content of the linked .php file into a div #include. That works superb, though I cannot use the back-/forward-buttons in the browser. Does anyone hast some advice for me on how to be able to use the back/forward buttons of my browser with that script?
[02:19:03] <r1chard> And1, you can use pushState (google it, also google History API), but you'll have to handle things manually i.e. what happens when you click back.
[02:19:28] <And1> r1chard: I'll check that, thanks.
[02:19:51] <r1chard> And1, also some old versions of IE don't support it. You can use alternatives there, like URL hash #foobar, or just ignore them.
[02:20:02] <CrowX-> why doesn't this $.getJSON fire? http://pastebin.com/Kha1rvVq
[02:20:31] <r1chard> CrowX-, maybe your JSON is invalid.
[02:22:57] <And1> r1chard: Is there another solution, which is supported by all browsers? Probably my script is the problem and I have to think of another way of loading the links in my nav.
[02:23:13] <CrowX-> r1chard, the content?
[02:31:41] <r1chard> And1, what are those links anyway.
[02:31:57] <r1chard> And1, as I said a #hash will work.
[02:32:05] <r1chard> And1, IE10 supports the new pushState API though.
[02:32:12] <And1> r1chard: There's something called history.js. Don't know if that's right for me. https://github.com/browserstate/history.js
[02:32:25] <And1> r1chard: What you mean with what are thos links anyway?
[02:32:29] <r1chard> Yes it's right, it'll handle older IEs by using #hash instead I think
[02:32:51] <r1chard> And1, I mean what is the content you're loading dynamically. Can I see it? Or, can you describe it?
[02:36:00] <And1> Sure, query.
[03:06:40] <nisseni> how can I use the productImage variable set inside the post function? http://pastie.org/private/e4z6rpeiauani2gu0i1dkg
[03:08:09] <nisseni> I know I can execute the code with in the $.post - but it doesn't work that well.
[03:11:16] <sahbeewah> nisseni, what do you mean it doesn't work that well
[03:14:00] <nisseni> sahbeewah: let me show you
[03:15:24] <nisseni> sahbeewah:
[03:15:26] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/h5d2xbqaymmfqdn2mhumwg
[03:16:32] <sahbeewah> what is that supposed to show
[03:16:54] <nisseni> I'm creating an app where you are able to change the logo on an image. When selecting the logo it sometimes "flickers" back to the one before. Almost like the variables are grabbed before the change and then changed back
[03:16:59] <nisseni> hard to explain :/
[03:17:28] <sahbeewah> one reason might be, because you're using global variables everywhere
[03:18:05] <sahbeewah> constrain your variables to a scope by declaring them with: var variableName;
[03:21:23] <sahbeewah> but skimming through that your main problem lies in setImageProperties
[03:22:38] <sahbeewah> the getImageData ajax call will assign the data to the productImage, after all that code below it gets executed
[03:23:34] <nisseni> sahbeewah: yeah, I get that. How can I avoid that?
[03:24:59] <nisseni> seems to have done the trick to set the val()'s in the .done function
[03:27:10] <sahbeewah> um, yeah that's one way, but that kind of changes your logic a bit
[03:28:05] <sahbeewah> because then if productImage already exists, it won't execute all that val() code
[03:28:17] <sahbeewah> whether or not that was intentional logic, i don't know
[03:28:32] <sahbeewah> but here's some code that probably does what you're after:
[03:28:33] <sahbeewah> http://pastie.org/8980053
[03:29:18] <sahbeewah> line 84 needs to be changed to: productImageDeferred.done(function(productImage) {
[03:33:45] <nisseni> thanks! What does deferred mean?
[03:36:48] <sahbeewah> it's basically an object whose purpose is to help you control the flow of logic in asynchronous situations
[03:37:20] <ravenzz> it is a status object
[03:37:26] <ravenzz> I guess
[03:39:45] <ravenzz> nisseni https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juRtEEsHI9E
[03:40:06] <nisseni> ah I see
[05:49:12] <Heinrich_> Can I not change the DOM on unload? I wish to add a simple spinner when the user navigates away from the page.
[06:04:16] <felixjet> it is posibble to select dinamically text?
[06:04:46] <iDevelop> Hello guys.
[06:06:14] <Heinrich_> Can I not change the DOM on unload? I wish to add a simple spinner when the user navigates away from the page.
[06:07:39] <felixjet> Heinrich_, no need to ask every 15 minutes. just wait
[06:08:51] <felixjet> and .unload is deprecated.
[06:08:51] <jphase> Heinrich_ you should be able to bind to $(window).on('unload', function(){ // add DOM node });
[06:08:55] <jphase> oh
[06:09:03] <jphase> that's right
[06:09:41] <jphase> beforeunload :\
[06:13:14] <Heinrich_> Ive previously had problems with beforeunload in safari
[06:13:21] <Heinrich_> So I changed to unload();
[06:13:48] <Heinrich_> And the function is called, but the changes to DOM are just not showing.
[06:15:19] <jphase> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/beforeunload
[06:15:42] <jphase> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/unload
[06:19:23] <And1> I'd need some help for combining two lines of code. I'm not sure how I would do this. Lines 16+17, 21+22. http://jsfiddle.net/4W4Mt/
[06:19:34] <And1> Maybe anyone could take a look at that please? : )
[06:20:36] <Heinrich_> jphase: Fair enough. Thank you :)
[06:23:00] <jphase> And1: you can chain those if you'd like, though it would sort of make some of that appear unneeded to me. You *can* use $('#include').html(response).empty().append(State.data.content);  but why add html to just empty it?
[06:24:35] <And1> jphase: I'm trying to add history.js to my already working script, I'm not completely sure if I'm doing it right... doesn't seem so. I think because of those lines I pointed out.
[06:24:56] <And1> Maybe I'd want to empty firs, then add the response and then append the rest. : x
[06:25:00] <And1> Or somesuch.
[06:27:45] <jphase> And1: that sounds like it makes a bit more sense yeah
[06:28:33] <And1> Though it doesn not seems to work. Hm. : /
[06:50:40] <torbjorn> I can never remember which array function ( map, grep, etc. ) that takes ( index, element ) and which takes ( element, index ), is there any secret to remembering this?
[06:50:45] <torbjorn> shouldnt it ideally have been consistent?
[06:52:35] <judasiendo> torbjorn: a tattoo on your left arm...
[06:53:13] <torbjorn> that is actually not a half-assed idea
[06:55:04] <judasiendo> i haven't got a better one. i find it confusing too
[06:56:05] <torbjorn> that would be a cool tattoo, until they fix it
[06:56:06] <judasiendo> or at least not intuitive enough
[06:58:43] <judasiendo> one of those fake tattoos sleeve with a cheat sheet
[06:58:56] <judasiendo> would do
[06:59:05] <judasiendo> in case it gets fixed
[06:59:32] <torbjorn> hm yup, just going through the trouble of creating it would probably make me remember them too, in the process
[06:59:51] <torbjorn> so no need to last forever
[07:07:01] <torbjorn> is there a way to select the first 3 TD's of every TR?
[07:08:39] <K3|Chris> yes
[07:11:36] <jphase> torbjorn: $('tr td:lt(3)')
[07:12:42] <torbjorn> i only get results from the first row
[07:12:51] <torbjorn> maybe my html is bad
[07:14:17] <torbjorn> i mean, 'tr td' would normally return all td's that follow a tr, right? so :lt(2) on that wouldn't that just return the first two td's on the first row
[07:14:25] <torbjorn> and not repeat the :lt(2) operation for each tr
[07:14:57] <jphase> oh my bad, yeah
[07:15:17] <torbjorn> :nth-child seems relevant, but only gives one element per row it seems
[07:16:26] <torbjorn> I tried with > too, but that just controls how far down the child can go
[07:16:28] <torbjorn> it seems
[07:18:58] <torbjorn> with .map perhaps
[07:21:35] <jphase> torbjorn: $('td:nth-of-type(-n+3)')
[07:22:45] <jphase> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ocyCm/
[07:23:16] <jphase> man, jsfiddle completely failed
[07:23:32] <jphase> nginx errors all over the place :x
[07:24:58] <x-finite> I have positioned a div using jQuery .. while the positioning is working perfectly, the cursor won't change to a pointer even thou i am using the cursor: pointer attribute
[07:25:56] <jphase> x-finite: have an example we can look at?
[07:28:10] <torbjorn> jphase: great thanks, why do you need -n there?
[07:28:46] <x-finite> jphase: making one
[07:29:40] <torbjorn> hm i realise it is to tell it to select from 0 to 3, and not 3 and up
[07:29:49] <torbjorn> but don't see how that works
[07:31:36] <jphase> torbjorn: css nth child pseudo selectors select the entire group and you have to use n math to limit the results
[07:31:57] <jphase> http://css-tricks.com/how-nth-child-works/
[07:32:08] <torbjorn> thanks
[07:32:09] <jphase> Chris Coyier is always a good resource for that stuff
[07:32:11] <jphase> np
[07:37:00] <x-finite> jphase: i have created an example (http://cssdeck.com/labs/vhyriyhr), however it is working fine
[07:37:35] <x-finite> jphase: but not in the actual project
[07:38:08] <jphase> x-finite: had a feeling that would happen. check your local copy for some badly placed css or anything with !important, etc.
[07:38:20] <jphase> z-index issues with transparent elements on top, etc.
[07:38:42] <And1> I just posted a question concerning history.js. Maybe someone can help! Thanks very much! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22745260/combine-jquery-history-js-with-another-script-which-includes-the-html-content-of
[07:38:59] <jphase> x-finite: also, this positioning can be done entirely with css - no need for jquery
[07:39:37] <x-finite> jphase: if i stop positioning it using jquery in the project, pointer changes normally
[07:40:22] <x-finite> jphase: i tried with the left: 50% method but it won't position properly ... it was a bit towards the right side so went with the JS then
[07:44:43] <jphase> x-finite: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ocyCm
[08:06:03] <x-finite> jphase: don't the margin-left and width attributes feel like 'fixes/patches' to the positioning issue? ..
[08:06:42] <x-finite> jphase: it appears to be working fine but there will be some 'hard core' coders reviewing my code, just concerned because of it
[08:08:06] <jphase> x-finite: that's a common method for centering things absolutely
[08:09:58] <jphase> if you want to use js, by all means go ahead. I just personally like to use css whenever possible since it's faster and better to use
[08:10:22] <jphase> the margin-left: -(1/2 of elements width)  is the same thing as your js calculations ;)
[08:12:09] <x-finite> okay .. anyways i am using pure css, got rid of the JS but the cursor issue persists...!! trying to figure out .. any hints?
[08:14:31] <x-finite> and yea, just confirmed that it is being overlapped with another element as the jquery click function won't work with it
[08:16:02] <x-finite> fixed it :)
[08:16:16] <x-finite> by increasing the z-index .. thanks  for the help :)
[08:19:35] <jphase> np
[08:46:16] <clime> anyone familiar with google maps? I'd like to find out if I am on max zoom currently.
[08:56:59] <iDevelop> try zooming in more. If it doesnt zoom any more, then you are
[09:02:57] <clime> iDevelop: ye and without that?
[09:04:11] <clime> iDevelop: i know there is getMaxZoomAtLatLng  in the api. It is asynchronous thing (it does request to find out max zoom level). I was hoping for some synchronous solution
[09:14:10] <iDevelop> idk, I've never had to work with gMaps
[09:19:35] <CrowX-> $(selector).next() works fine for iterating through the siblings of an element. How do I make it run in circles, i.e. make it start from the first() after it reaches the last() without checking every time if the element is last?
[09:20:44] <systemfault> There’s no way.
[09:21:02] <systemfault> Unless you implement some kind of circular linked list in JS...
[09:21:42] <CrowX-> k
[09:21:48] <clime> crowX: you need to make it your own solution
[09:27:45] <decx> you don't have to check if it's the last or first, just if next() is empty
[09:36:49] <CrowX-> decx, is it faster to check if it's empty rather than if it's last, or what?
[09:40:22] <decx> no idea if it's faster, but you're gonna use .next() anyway
[09:41:08] <decx> something like: el.click(function(){ var next = $(this).next(); var realnext = ( next.length > 0 ) ? next : el.first(); })
[09:48:37] <gnarf> CrowX-: decx: something like $.fn.nextOrFirst() { var next = this.next(); if (!next.length) return this.siblings().first(); else return next; } ?
[09:51:15] <decx> that looks a bit more aesthetic
[09:51:49] <gnarf> rather $.fn.nextOrFirst = function() { var next = this.next(); if (!next.length) return this.siblings().first(); else return next; };
[09:52:26] <decx> if without curly braces, you make me sick :>
[09:53:04] <gnarf> sure
[09:53:14] <gnarf> if it wasn't typed in IRC id of included em
[09:55:24] <Panni> Hey everonye, can someone help me out with my code? http://jsfiddle.net/CBD77/1/ When you click a word from the list and then select something from the sublist the word you clicked and your selection from the sublist are swapped. If you want to do this again it doesn't fire the event (console doesn't log "bla" )
[09:55:47] <gnarf> decx: CrowX- http://jsbin.com/godep/1/
[09:56:12] <CrowX-> gnarf, nice :)
[09:56:15] <CrowX-> thanks
[10:01:59] <CrowX-> I have an onclick event handler that takes 3 arguments. 2 are set in the div tag like this onclick(event, 'argument1').  Now, I want to make a .trigger('click') event that pushes a third argument, but the other 2 arguments to be the same as defined in the div's onclick declaration.
[10:02:13] <CrowX-> is this possible?
[10:14:33] <decx> i have to see this in action to grasp the concept
[10:17:20] <gnarf> CrowX-: possible - yeah, however I'd almost suggest you think about a different method than binding or passing data on click events
[10:17:57] <gnarf> if you're calling .trigger('click') - it sounds like what you really want is to just call the "action" in the click handler directly, refactor such that that method is available to you outside of the click context, and life might be easier :)
[10:18:36] <gnarf> if you're binding up data on the "on" - you could actually just write a method that returns the method and saves some context (look up "closures")
[10:19:03] <CrowX-> ok
[10:30:56] <Panni> Can someone explain to me why my click event can only be fired once? So if I click the element for the first time everything works correctly but if I click the element again, nothing happens
[10:50:38] <TheWhisper> Hi
[10:53:02] <TheWhisper> I'm trying to load content inline from another page, but I can't get it working.
[10:53:32] <TheWhisper> http://hastebin.com/hosunidana.vhdl
[10:53:35] <TheWhisper> is the current code I have
[10:54:57] <gavrochel> hello
[10:55:48] <gavrochel> I'm using $.ajax but the response takes about 1 second to complete
[10:56:31] <gavrochel> no matter how big the response is
[11:13:24] <Velveeta> gavrochel: was there a question in that?
[11:13:44] <gavrochel> yes
[11:13:54] <gavrochel> it is supposed to take that long?
[11:15:19] <Velveeta> that depends on your server
[11:15:32] <gavrochel> i'm on localhost (xampp)
[11:16:07] <Velveeta> right, but i mean what kind of back end framework you're running, setup and teardown times, etc
[11:16:29] <Velveeta> nothing client side is causing that full second, if that's what you're asking
[11:18:29] <Velveeta> and thewhisper: that snippet is incomplete, where are you calling it from? since you're referencing 'this', what context is it executing in? i'm assuming an anchor since you're referencing its href, but i don't know how you're binding that up
[11:18:37] <TheWhisper> https://gist.github.com/andrewSC/9875773#file-gistfile1-js-L26
[11:18:52] <CrowX-> In this example http://jsfiddle.net/9LbPW/  how do I get somefunction to run with flag passed as a parameter and get the alert say it's defined?
[11:19:14] <TheWhisper> Velveeta ^
[11:19:21] <TheWhisper> wait
[11:19:27] <TheWhisper> Velveeta, wrong link, sorry
[11:19:35] <TheWhisper> Here, Velveeta: https://github.com/whispy/whispy.github.io/blob/master/js/custom.js#L13
[11:20:35] <alaing> hi CrowX- i'll take a look
[11:21:44] <Velveeta> thewhisper: when you execute that loadContent function, you're loading scope, execute it like this instead: loadContent.call(this);
[11:22:19] <TheWhisper> Whoa, that worked!
[11:22:24] <Velveeta> huzzah!
[11:22:57] <TheWhisper> Velveeta, what exactly do you mean by "loading scope"?
[11:23:44] <Velveeta> er i meant "losing" scope :)
[11:24:12] <TheWhisper> hm
[11:24:16] <TheWhisper> I see
[11:26:13] <alaing> CrowX-: i'm not sure about your useages of "this"
[11:27:11] <CrowX-> alaing, I just picked it up from example projects I've seen
[11:27:55] <CrowX-> alaing, is it better not to use 'this' in examples like this?
[11:28:07] <alaing> I've not realyl come across it used like that
[11:28:29] <alaing> "this" can becaome quiet confusing
[11:31:21] <alaing> plus i think you might be flooding the global namespace
[11:31:38] <alaing> can I rewrite it
[11:32:50] <alaing> using a "singleton" pattern
[11:34:19] <CrowX-> alaing, what's a singleton pattern?
[11:35:46] <alaing> a coding technique
[11:35:54] <alaing> a javascript pattern
[11:37:08] <alaing> The Singleton pattern is thus known because it restricts instantiation of a class to a single object. Classically, the Singleton pattern can be implemented by creating a class with a method that creates a new instance of the class if one doesn't exist. In the event of an instance already existing, it simply returns a reference to that object.
[11:37:09] <alaing> Singletons differ from static classes (or objects) as we can delay their initialization, generally because they require some information that may not be available during initialization time. They don't provide a way for code that is unaware of a previous reference to them to easily retrieve them. This is because it is neither the object or "class" that's returned by a Singleton, it's a...
[11:37:10] <alaing> ...structure. Think of how closured variables aren't actually closures - the function scope that provides the closure is the closure.
[11:37:12] <alaing> In JavaScript, Singletons serve as a shared resource namespace which isolate implementation code from the global namespace so as to provide a single point of access for functions.
[11:37:33] <_genuser_> I wasn't listening to Oops I did it again....
[11:38:45] <io____> hallo, i am looking for a plugin to make a stiky menu, now there are a ton of them but my idea is to have a menu that is fixed by default, then it starts moving upward when an element touches it, then it sticks again, so it has 2 fixed positions. Any hint about which direction to take?
[11:40:36] <ajf-> When doing a $.each, is the DOM traversed through siblings first, or does it go into the first child first?
[11:40:42] <Velveeta> _genuser_ that's good to know... now don't listen to bieber either
[11:40:56] <_genuser_> nah, just the britney spears song...
[11:41:08] <Velveeta> right, but you *weren't* listening to that
[11:41:14] <Velveeta> so i was saying don't listen to bieber either
[11:41:23] <_genuser_> it's got fun memories of college. frat houses used to play it all the time, 'coz the visitors (chicks) would love it.
[11:41:39] <_genuser_> Velveeta: yeah, the wasn't was just to say that I was listening to it. lol.
[11:41:46] <Velveeta> ajf: $.each iterates over a collection, in the order that they appear in the collection
[11:41:48] <_genuser_> but beieber not....
[11:41:58] <Velveeta> it doesn't traverse children unless those children are explicitly part of the collection
[11:42:07] <Velveeta> _genuser_ i know ;)
[11:42:55] <Velveeta> crowx: oh yeah, and also, as to your original question, any parameters you're passing to an event trigger need to be passed as an array i believe
[11:42:59] <Velveeta> [flag1] vs flag1
[11:43:10] <_genuser_> man how the cheesiest of songs can be associated with fun time and become just great songs.
[11:44:20] <alaing> CrowX-: what is the "flag" used for?
[11:45:22] <CrowX-> it's supposed to be a boolean variable that will change the course of execution of the future call of the function
[11:46:26] <CrowX-> alaing, here's a updated version of the code that doesn't do infinite recursion http://jsfiddle.net/9LbPW/3/
[11:46:51] <CrowX-> btw, this code is an isolated case, to simplify the solving of the problem I have
[11:48:07] <Velveeta> crowx: like alaing was saying, that 'this' reference is a little out of place there, you can drop it completely and just make that function somefunction(event, flag) instead
[11:48:28] <Velveeta> this.functionname is typically only used inside of something like a constructor function
[11:48:44] <Velveeta> and that's only if someone's not using a prototype to set up their methods, like they should be :)
[11:49:43] <CrowX-> ok, I'll do that
[11:49:44] <Velveeta> also, please don't use onclick attributes, they're old and ickypoo :) bind up your listeners as part of your javascript
[11:50:25] <CrowX-> but I need to use an onclick attribute just this time :)
[11:50:36] <Velveeta> why do you need to?
[11:50:41] <CrowX-> otherwise I'd have to redo a lot of my code, which is supposed to be finished in the next few hours
[11:50:44] <Velveeta> this is much cleaner: http://jsfiddle.net/9LbPW/5/
[11:50:49] <Velveeta> yowza
[11:52:20] <alaing> CrowX-: what browser are you using to develop on? I would recommend you use console.log instead of alert()
[11:53:57] <CrowX-> alaing, chromium. And I use alert cause I notice it better when I'm sleepy, and i haven't slept for the past 32 hours
[11:56:50] <alaing> http://jsfiddle.net/9LbPW/6/
[11:57:12] <alaing> CrowX-: thats not good for any project to be sleepy......
[11:58:02] <alaing> CrowX-: both for youself and for the overall success of the project........no money is worth your life.
[12:00:09] <CrowX-> I agree, but in this case I have no other choice
[12:02:47] <alaing> CrowX-: if it ever gets to that state where you have no choice then the project planning has failed.
[12:03:08] <CrowX-> the project should be over in the next few hours if I get over this problem
[12:09:21] <CrowX-> btw, thanks for teaching me about my 'this' overusage
[12:10:46] <garbagegod> so jQuery validate doesn't work with jQuery 2?
[12:12:22] <garbagegod> that sucks
[12:13:16] <alaing> CrowX-: no problem as i said last night with your menu issue it was a bit over complicated and used "this" quiet a bit
[12:13:49] <CrowX-> yeah, I cleared it off now
[12:13:55] <CrowX-> looks neater this way
[12:15:12] <alaing> CrowX-: good, i suggest after a couple days rest I highly recommend you take a look at "this" http://jstherightway.org
[12:15:13] <Velveeta> garbagegod: jquery 2 removes legacy browser support, but outside of that, should be functionally equivalent as far as i know.. what's not working with jquery validate?
[12:15:35] <alaing> Velveeta: yeah that my understanding of jQuery 2
[12:16:02] <alaing> and you should be able to just "swap out" jqueyr 1 and 2 because the api will be the same
[12:16:10] <Velveeta> right
[12:17:20] <CrowX-> I will
[12:18:40] <garbagegod> Velveeta: $.validate is undefined
[12:19:29] <alaing> garbagegod: that coudl because of loads of different reasons
[12:19:29] <Velveeta> and this is gonna sound like a stupid question, but.. you *are* loading jquery validate, right?
[12:19:56] <garbagegod> Yeah, I know
[12:20:01] <garbagegod> Yes
[12:20:05] <alaing> demo?
[12:20:29] <garbagegod> no time atm
[12:21:10] <alaing> just copy and paste your html?
[12:21:30] <Velveeta> *into a pastebin or something* not here in the room :D
[12:21:42] <alaing> vakymal: I dont want your webcam
[12:22:12] <alaing> Velveeta: lol yeah not in here
[12:26:14] <macscam1> hello can somebody take a look at this simple javascript/jquery? I think the closing tags on line 43 need to be there, but when I put them there, the each loop does not run
[12:26:39] <Velveeta> link?
[12:26:54] <macscam1> essentially leaving this each loop open seems like the only functional thing, but it's not fully functional
[12:26:54] <macscam1> https://gist.github.com/MaxPleaner/9878232
[12:27:40] <CrowX-> yes!
[12:27:46] <CrowX-> I solved it
[12:27:56] <Velveeta> macscam1: your each loop ends on line 26
[12:27:58] <macscam1> i think I did too ....  was it the missing parenthesis on the next line?
[12:28:48] <macscam1> okay Velveeta thanks
[12:29:09] <Velveeta> no i mean.. your loop doesn't end on 43 where you think it ends
[12:29:32] <macscam1> Velveeta ok I tried that fix but it doesnt load stuff
[12:29:33] <Velveeta> proper indentation: it's your friend... copy/paste your code into jsbeautifier.org and look at it with proper indentation
[12:29:41] <Velveeta> well then that's not your problem
[12:29:48] <Velveeta> i didn't post a fix of any kind, btw
[12:29:57] <Velveeta> i just said line 26 is where your each loop actually ends
[12:30:06] <macscam1> oh well you told me not to end my loop early.... and i deleted those closing tags ...
[12:30:50] <Velveeta> i didn't tell you not to end it early, i just pointed out where it ended based on that snippet you posted :D
[12:31:39] <macscam1> ok well pardon my assumptions
[12:32:39] <Velveeta> so i'm not sure what you're trying to figure out with that gist
[12:33:17] <Velveeta> on line 33 though, you have the word "Marker" by itself, not sure what that's about
[12:58:23] <jdo_dk> When loading pages with ajax. I quite often have this included in the loaded page: $(function(){ my code )}; How to prevent the code from being loaded over and over, and only be loaded "once"
[12:59:24] <__joshua__> on the page you are loading?
[12:59:40] <__joshua__> don't append them to the document
[12:59:41] <jdo_dk> __joshua__: Yes
[13:00:13] <jdo_dk> __joshua__: WIll create small jsbin. hold on..
[13:01:22] <__joshua__> $.get('somehtmlpagewithembeddedscripts.html', function(data){ $('myselector', data).appendTo('whereeverinmydoc'); });
[13:01:32] <Velveeta> you'll need to set some kind of variable to alert the page that the code has already been executed
[13:01:59] <__joshua__> Velveeta: very kludgey
[13:02:03] <Velveeta> like window.loadedAlready = false; and in your js, check for: if (!window.loadedAlready) { ...do stuff... window.loadedAlready = true; }
[13:02:24] <Velveeta> yeah it's kludgey, but so is having the same snippet of js in multiple pages you're loading and needing it to only execute once
[13:02:33] <Velveeta> you need a kludgey solution for a kludgey use case
[13:02:39] <__joshua__> yeah, the real solution is to not get the js in the first plac
[13:03:02] <Velveeta> or have the js loaded in some common.js file and only executed once
[13:03:14] <jdo_dk> __joshua__: So you would remove the js from the loaded page ?
[13:03:51] <__joshua__> you initial page should have the js.  any ajax call you make to fetch html shouldn't have that js
[13:03:59] <Velveeta> rightio
[13:05:03] <jdo_dk> __joshua__: WIll go fix right away. Thanks for heads up. :D
[13:05:07] <__joshua__> but if you are hacking a multi page site into a single page site, then extracting the nonscript/style parts, probably from the body, will work
[13:05:20] <__joshua__> but its wrong and ugly
[13:31:44] <c0mrade_> Can I use jquery  $.post() without using the third parameter in it? Like without using the call back function?
[13:33:18] <Velveeta> sure
[13:38:17] <Puck6633> I have a pretty straightforward question, but I can't seem to find an answer with Google: How would I induce an error state on an AJAX request from the server side of things? i.e. if I use $.post().done().fail() to load a page, how do I trigger the .fail() from my server-side script?
[13:38:35] <Puck6633> I'm guessing modify the header to send an HTTP error code?
[13:38:42] <Velveeta> it depends on your language on the backend
[13:39:03] <Velveeta> you'll need to throw an error condition of some kind, which'll trigger the appropriate header
[13:39:17] <Puck6633> I'm using PHP, but I assumed since I'm using jQuery on the front end the interface would be standard.
[13:39:19] <Velveeta> and yes, you can manually write out the appropriate headers also
[13:39:40] <Velveeta> well, the jquery side of things will be standard, yes, and it'll just read the error code that's spit back from the server
[13:40:08] <Velveeta> but you asked how to trigger it from your server, so you'll need to know how to proper throw an error code back, which'll depend on the server-side language, php in this case
[13:40:32] <Puck6633> Okay, thank you both. I think I can manage the headers, I just wanted to know if there was a better or more accepted way.
[13:40:38] <Velveeta> you can try this: http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.http-response-code.php
[13:40:45] <docmur> Is it possible to use $("#id").load() with enctype="multipart/form-data"?
[13:41:48] <Puck6633> Would it be better to send a JSON response and read it in .done() instead? Is there a down side to using an HTTP error code?
[13:41:49] <docmur> Or a better qustion might be, if I put enctype in my <form> tag and serialize it with jquery, will it get picked up and processed correctly over to the PHP script?
[13:42:42] <Velveeta> docmur: i'm not exactly sure what you're asking... .load() issues a GET-type request, not a POST-type, so the enctype would be ignored
[13:42:59] <Velveeta> puck6633: some people do it that way, it depends on how close to RESTful you want to get
[13:43:22] <Velveeta> i like http codes for certain errors, and a 400-response with json errors for validation issues
[13:43:44] <Puck6633> Velveeta: Hm, okay. I will read a little more about REST and see what sounds better. Thank you! :)
[13:43:50] <Velveeta> no problemo
[13:44:37] <Velveeta> docmur: if you serialize your form and pass it to php, yes, it should be received properly
[13:45:15] <docmur> so serialize() will pass my data as an object and hence load() will use POST not GET?
[13:45:18] <Velveeta> now if you have multipart form data, as part of a file upload or something, unless you're supporting all modern browsers with xhr2 support, you'll need to do something other than a standard ajax form submission
[13:45:22] <docmur> If I understand the jquery page correctly
[13:45:41] <Velveeta> no, serialize will pass it as a serialized string, but php will parse that properly into your $_POST superglobal
[13:46:02] <Velveeta> load is for loading data from the server, not posting data to the server
[13:46:33] <Velveeta> if you pass a data object in your .load() call, it gets passed as serialized url parameters, i.e. GET variables
[13:46:47] <Velveeta> like if you hit a page for /user/profile/37 or something
[13:46:56] <Velveeta> or /user_profile?id=37
[13:47:06] <docmur> okay
[13:47:09] <Velveeta> you could call .load() and pass { id: 37 } and that's how it would be serialized into the url
[14:36:58] <Jakobud> does anyone know if its possible for Query Builder or Eloquent to set the key of the array of objects to be the id of the object itself?
[14:37:35] <Jakobud> so if your object you get are id's 5, 6, 7  your Eloquent object's array of objects wouldn't be in an array with keys 0, 1, 2 but , 5, 6, 7 instead
[14:37:50] <Jakobud> is it possible to do without doing it manually?
[14:40:41] <__joshua__> id === dom id tags?
[14:40:51] <__joshua__> so you want an object or hash rather than an array?
[14:41:17] <Jakobud> I want an array, but I want the keys to actually be the ids of the objects in the arrays
[14:41:26] <Jakobud> insead of just a numerical 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc
[14:41:44] <Jakobud> it makes it easy to do a lookup on a big array of eloquent objects
[15:00:38] <Guest48182> I'm writing tests with chai and mocha
[15:00:59] <Guest48182> trying to use jQuery in tests, but selects don't match any dom elements
[15:01:06] <Guest48182> selectors*
[15:01:58] <Guest48182> how should html elements and events be handled in mocha browser testing
[15:02:24] <__joshua__> using iframes>'
[15:02:25] <__joshua__> ?
[15:02:32] <Guest48182> no?
[15:03:31] <Guest48182> http://paste2.org/xxaGkZLd $('#testForm') is not found in test.js
[15:12:24] <sadtaco> http://codecanyon.net/item/flavr-flat-jquery-popup-dialog/full_screen_preview/7021021?ref=jqueryrain Is there a plugin for jquery ui that adds nicer fade in animations than these? :/   Jquery UI's animations are terrible.
[15:12:58] <__joshua__> you mean the fade on teh buttons?
[15:13:07] <__joshua__> animation, rather
[15:13:37] <__joshua__> the on hover?
[15:15:48] <__joshua__> they look find to me.  you can also try changing the 'easing' argument
[15:16:14] <__joshua__> fine*
[15:16:16] <sadtaco> http://jqueryui.com/show/ I mean these
[15:16:18] <sadtaco> These are terrible
[15:16:31] <sadtaco> flavrs are much nicer, but I just want those animations and not the whole plugin
[15:17:08] <__joshua__> well yes, they are terrible.  transitions like that are pretty amateurish
[15:17:48] <__joshua__> I use fade in relunctantly to distract while a ajax call is going on
[15:18:55] * sadtaco shrugs
[15:19:08] <sadtaco> I want animations on my dialogs popping in just like flavr's, nothing more or less.
[15:29:13] <Jquery_> Hi there , can anyone tell me please how do I get all elements of a kind with find("#myelem") instead of getting first item as prevItem ?
[15:29:20] <Jquery_> prevObject*
[15:31:14] <Jquery_> tumbleweed
[15:42:09] <__joshua__> all elements that have the same id?
[15:42:11] <__joshua__> should be only 1
[15:43:01] <__joshua__> jq find returns a jquery array, so will be all matching els
[17:00:57] <relipse__> what is the best in-place editor for like quickly editing <spans etc? I dont think jeditable is sufficient

[20:03:19] <syntaks> heya folks
[20:04:03] <syntaks> i've got an ajax request fetching via get on a php script that echoes out data
[20:04:15] <syntaks> the request is made, return's 200 on the request
[20:04:25] <syntaks> yet what i'm left with (from the designer)
[20:04:33] <syntaks> is something that's supposed to replace existing html with the results
[20:04:51] <syntaks> however, it's failing and i'm not so sure as to why
[20:05:11] <syntaks> he has data: {} and the defining variables, success: function(html) {}
[20:05:28] <syntaks> when it wouldn't display, i added in: error: function() { alert("error"); }
[20:05:42] <syntaks> sure enough even after the get request was successful to the server, it alerted me that it was an error
[20:05:50] <syntaks> i'm not a jquery guy, i'm a php dev
[20:05:59] <syntaks> i'm just trying to unstick a mess this designer left us with
[20:06:19] <syntaks> if anyone had a free minute they could spare i'd really appreciate the hand
[20:13:21] <monk3y> I've got a web-UI that lists a city (text-label) and all of its zip-codes (text-labels).  If you check the city, it checks all zip-codes.  Or you can check zip-codes by themselves.  Anyone heard of a UI helper like this?  Or should I just decorate all the zip-code checkbox inputs with either classes or data-* that tags them with the city-id?
[20:13:45] <monk3y> (and each text-label has a input type='checkbox' next to it)
[20:19:16] <relipse> i cant remember but what was the library that detects typing intervals (not just one key but a few keys at at time)
[20:26:18] <Dogamondo> Hey all

[21:39:48] <Hardik_> Hi everyone..
[21:40:22] <Hardik_> i want to call java action class method from jquery..
[21:40:39] <Hardik_> can any one help me , how can i do that?
[21:41:15] <systemfault> What is a java action class
[21:41:34] <Hardik_> i am using struts 2 framework
[21:42:28] <Hardik_> so basically i want to know how can i call server method from theweb layer
[21:44:22] <Hardik_> I am using the IRC for the first time.. I would be thankful if someone help me to understand how you guys are chatting here with each other..
[21:44:52] <systemfault> Hardik_: Well, first of all, you need to create routes using your java frameworks (BTW, struts is old and sucks ballz)
[21:44:53] <Hardik_> is there any protocol to be followed for the chatting?
[21:45:16] <systemfault> Hardik_: Not really, just be polite and don’t ask to ask… just ask
[21:46:00] <Hardik_> okay..
[21:46:36] <systemfault> Hardik_: So, have you set up a route that you could call using jQuery?
[21:47:11] <Hardik_> do you have any link or pdf or something to understand this in detail?
[21:48:28] <systemfault> You don’t know how to use strut?
[21:48:39] <systemfault> Why did you pick that shitty framework then?
[21:48:53] <Hardik_> i am learning this framework
[21:49:22] <systemfault> Why? You miss the 2000s?
[21:49:38] <systemfault> JEE, Spring, Play… everything is better than strut
[21:49:43] <systemfault> Anyway...
[21:50:19] <Hardik_> what you guys are using? no.. i am not missing 2000s.. :) as per my knowledge, struts 2 framework is widely used in the corporate world...
[21:50:27] <Hardik_> and its the market demand
[21:50:42] <Hardik_> thats the only reason for chosing it
[21:51:39] <systemfault> Anyway… no matter what Java framework you pick, we don’t support them here :/ So, get a route working in whatever framework you want, once it’s done, we’ll be more than happy to help you to use jQuery to call it.
[21:51:59] <Hardik_> okay..
[21:52:47] <Hardik_> one last question... which java framework you guys perfer other than struts 2?
[21:53:01] <systemfault> Hardik_: Spring is pretty much the standard
[21:53:17] <Hardik_> okay.. thanks for the help
[21:53:18] <systemfault> Play is an easier and overall nicer framework but it’s more for hipsters.
[21:53:45] <systemfault> Spring MVC + DI + Security… can’t go wrong with that.
[21:54:12] <Hardik_> okay .. great
[22:46:04] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/6xbdb1ecbwlhgu1agonh1q - when this method is executed it sets new values to some inputs. I have some other methods using these values, however, those methods is using the values that were there before the click. I'm not sure, maybe the methods are loaded with data and waiting for execution?
[23:19:26] <relipse> hey guys what you think of my plugin https://github.com/relipse/jquery-onTypeSomeKeys/blob/master/jquery.onTypeSomeKeys.js

[23:19:47] <relipse> i just converted the stackflow answer to a plugin mind you

[23:33:14] <Besan> ound good :)
[23:34:46] <Besan> Here is my code
[23:34:47] <Besan> http://paste.ee/p/mOYZK
[23:35:03] <Besan> I'm using cordova to build up an application
[23:35:53] <Besan> the code itself works but, if i expand an collapsible, it collapse itself every 5 seconds
[23:36:30] <Besan> How can i change my code so it will stay expanded while data is being updated from mySql
[23:36:33] <Besan> ?
[23:37:21] <Besan> I hope my question was clear
[23:39:52] <Besan> I can see more then a hundred users online but none seems to be available to help . . .
[23:39:54] <Besan> :(
[23:40:01] <Cork> Besan: you prob need to create a demo of the page
[23:40:13] <Besan> you mean jsfiddle ?
[23:40:17] <Cork> cause as far as i can tell there isn't any expand code in your pb
[23:40:19] <Cork> yes
[23:40:21] <Cork> or jsbin
[23:40:43] <Besan> cork, how long you'll be online ?
[23:40:55] <Besan> let me prepare an fiddle
[23:41:07] <Cork> Besan: i should be here long enough
[23:41:17] <Cork> don't over work it, just enough to tell what your doing is enough
[23:41:29] <Besan> prefect :) Give me 5-6 mins
[23:48:44] <Besan> cork, here is an example of my page http://jsfiddle.net/besanu/6zkna/
[23:49:01] <Besan> var jsonString is just to simulate json data
[23:49:21] <Besan> i don't know how to simulate it in jsfiddle . . .
[23:49:59] <acriax> Hi, I'm attempting to create a dropdown menu which should appear when hovering over an anchor-tag. The problem is that as soon as I move the mouse out of there, it hides again. That is, the dropdown won't stay when moving the cursor from the link down to the dropdown-ul.
[23:50:03] <Cork> ah
[23:50:04] <Cork> jqm
[23:50:21] <Cork> Besan: be sure to mention that when you ask questions, as it makes a lot of difference
[23:50:39] <Besan> Sorry :)
[23:51:15] <systemfault> It’s usually for the worse though as pretty much nobody cares about jqmobile..
[23:51:17] <acriax> The effect I want to achieve is that after mouseleaving the link, the dropdown should stay open for a second, then disappear. But if the user hovers over the dropdown, it should stay open indefinitely
[23:51:42] <Cork> Besan: i'm just guessing here but you could try removing the ui-collapsible-content-collapsed class
[23:51:51] <Cork> Besan: but ya, i can't really help you much with jqm
[23:52:00] <Besan> So, can i do it the right way ? I need to update my data in "collapsible" every 5 seconds without collapsing them . . .
[23:52:06] <Besan> ehhh . . .
[23:52:26] <Cork> acriax: is the ul inside the a tag?
[23:52:31] <acriax> no
[23:52:40] <acriax> should it be?
[23:52:50] <Cork> acriax: it would make the logic simpler
[23:53:05] <acriax> Cork: I'll try it out
[23:53:07] <Cork> cause then you could use mouseenter and mouseleave
[23:53:19] <Cork> and it would just know when you left the dropdown
[23:53:34] <Macaveli> Morning cork
[23:53:38] <Macaveli> Cork*
[23:53:47] <Cork> else you would have to track what element you move to and if it is the dropdown not hide it and...
[23:53:55] <Cork> the exceptions just goes on and on
[23:53:58] <Cork> Macaveli: o/
[23:54:43] <Cork> i did that in a project a while back when i couldn't move the dropdown
[23:55:04] <Cork> and after a while the js to keep the menu stable was insane
[23:56:44] <acriax> Cork: yeah, it makes total sense :)
