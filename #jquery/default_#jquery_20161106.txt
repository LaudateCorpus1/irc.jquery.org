[03:22:46] <inthl> this question is about datatables, but may also have an answer with jquery js: I have datatables + responsive in use, now there are say 5 columns in a table that become less and less during resizing the screen to a smaller viewport. one can expand this by clicking the usual (+) sign. the expanded view shows the (e.g.) 1 row visible + 4 rows below it stacked ...as usual. Now what I want is to have one of these 4 rows removed from that stack and in that stac
[03:22:46] <inthl> k only. so if it is being displayed in the table row, it should be visible, but invisible while stacked by dt-responsive
[03:23:19] <inthl> i tried to hide the td on that viewport or to hide its contents on that viewport...but that did not help and/or caused dt-responsive to behave in a broken matter
[03:56:13] <Paddy> Hi there. How can I avoid the second (identical) ajax call here: https://jsfiddle.net/sfnxbku7/  See console log
[04:09:46] <Paddy> Most solutions I could find say to use a global variable to store the ajax status but that kind of goes against the deferred nature of the problem
[04:19:52] <cluelessperson> hey guys, how can I detect a change on a PRE or CODE element, with the "contenteditable" attribute?
[04:20:04] <cluelessperson> they don't seem to activate jquery's  .change(  event
[04:26:33] <faraway> I have a question about the docs at https://api.jquery.com/ready/, the docs say ‚[…]As of jQuery 3.0, only the first syntax is recommended; the other syntaxes still work but are deprecated.[…]‘. To me this reads as if only  „$( handler )“, but I would assume the first syntax the note referes to is „$( document ).ready( handler )“?
[06:14:41] <d[10]> I took the data table value with ajax correctly. But the value is coming to "" (eg 2.5). How do I return the value without the "?"

[09:08:40] <RonaldsM> I cannot add database file to api.php which I use to load with jquery
[09:09:01] <RonaldsM> it does not take any variables from included files
[09:09:46] <RonaldsM> but I really need username variable to load only usernames that are not user itself
[09:53:55] <jquery422> someone knows how to make this to a loop? --> https://jsfiddle.net/mexhg8zj/
[10:26:01] <jquery422> update! but loop not work ---> https://jsfiddle.net/mexhg8zj/1/

[10:31:46] <sillyslux> jquery422, what's `$(document).each(function(i) {` supposed to do??
[10:32:42] <jquery422> sillyslux : need to loop it from somewhere?
[10:33:34] <sillyslux> $(document) gives you an array with one object (document)
[10:33:55] <sillyslux> so you're looping on time
[10:34:15] <jquery422> oh.. so I can go with $.each =)
[10:34:17] <sillyslux> you want to loop on localstorage
[10:35:15] <jquery422> sillyslux: ues
[10:35:17] <jquery422> yes
[10:35:29] <jquery422> $(localstorage) ?
[10:37:46] <sillyslux> won't work
[10:38:18] <jquery422> sillyslux : no, tried that
[10:39:51] <jquery422> someway I need to set localStorage so it check all numbers
[10:40:10] <sillyslux> try something like Object.keys(localStorage).forEach(item=>console.log(localStorage.getItem(item)))

[11:06:42] <RonaldsM> can anybody read what I write here
[11:07:06] <jquery422> sillyslux : Object.keys(localStorage).forEach(function(item){
[11:07:09] <RonaldsM> I just changed nick, I don't know if maybe my status is wrong
[11:07:34] <jquery422> I got it localStorage with uppercase on S , but i got same reslut
[11:10:02] <sillyslux> haha yes RonaldsM we can hear you loud and clear
[11:11:14] <sillyslux> you're asking for help, and everybody here will help if he/she can
[11:11:48] <sillyslux> but you make it sound like you want somebody to do it for you and nobody wants that
[11:13:11] <sillyslux> jquery422, still `...'Off' of undefined` ?
[11:13:38] <jquery422> sillyslux : yes, im trying other methods also
[11:13:57] <sillyslux> what exactly is undefined?
[11:14:05] <sillyslux> what are you trying to access?
[11:14:28] <sillyslux> what variable is `Off`?
[11:14:50] <sillyslux> is it item and localStorage[item]?
[11:15:12] <sillyslux> put something on jsfiddle
[11:17:08] <jquery422> sillyslux : row 1 and 2
[11:17:11] <jquery422> http://pastebin.com/3ywzUndy
[11:17:54] <RonaldsM> sillyslux: yeah, then look at my code http://apaste.info/GRHNJ
[11:18:03] <RonaldsM> there is comments of what need to be done
[11:19:40] <sillyslux> see how `needs to be done` and `nobody want to do it for you` fits?
[11:20:01] <sillyslux>  //I need form that loads data into database VIA AJAX without reloading whole page
[11:20:24] <sillyslux> why don't you just start and ask for help when you get stuck?
[11:20:58] <sillyslux> it's been 30 minutes already, you could have been half way through
[11:20:59] <jquery422> sillyslux : https://jsfiddle.net/9zuy2ccq/
[11:23:24] <sillyslux> localStorage.bodyClass[item]? hm then why don't you forget about localStorage altogether, use it just to save and read a json string, but do your logic on the parsed jsonstring
[11:24:30] <sillyslux> `localStorage.bodyClass` can only be a string
[11:25:00] <sillyslux> yet you are trying to access it like an array/object localStorage.bodyClass[item]
[11:26:28] <RonaldsM> I need to scroll down automaticly on page load
[11:26:41] <RonaldsM> any javascript/jquery function
[11:29:45] <RonaldsM> How to load these QUERYs with AJAX - http://apaste.info/JQvFQ
[11:30:32] <RonaldsM> nobody know
[11:30:33] <RonaldsM> s?
[11:31:05] <RonaldsM> sillysux,because it does not work
[11:31:51] <RonaldsM> there is WHERE fromuser = ? AND touser = ? and I need those variables in there
[11:32:30] <sillyslux> you can submit them with GET and POST
[11:32:33] <RonaldsM> how
[11:32:42] <RonaldsM> can You give me snippet of code
[11:34:05] <sillyslux> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/ and http://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/
[11:34:13] <sillyslux> examples included
[11:36:39] <RonaldsM> http://apaste.info/iIApv
[11:36:42] <RonaldsM> this is my try
[11:37:33] <RonaldsM> I don't understand info from that page
[11:37:45] <RonaldsM> can You give me right example for my code
[11:40:50] <RonaldsM> none of that code makes sense
[11:40:54] <sillyslux> aha.. you're loading a list of chat users, what is are `fromuser` and `touser` supposed to be?
[11:41:30] <RonaldsM> http://apaste.info/GRHNJ
[11:42:03] <RonaldsM> here ?chat='.$usernamechat.'
[11:42:20] <RonaldsM> fromuser is user itself
[11:42:36] <RonaldsM> touser is user the user is sending message to
[11:44:59] <RonaldsM> it does not work because I can't get data like fromuser from database and touser does not get data from just loading chatusers.php
[11:46:22] <sillyslux> and in <div id="outputusers"></div> you want to display up to 200 entries FROM chat WHERE fromuser = is the user himself AND touser = who, all the users he has ever talked to before?
[11:46:46] <RonaldsM> no
[11:47:19] <RonaldsM> that was mistake it supposed to be outputmessages
[11:47:24] <RonaldsM> or something like that
[11:47:40] <sillyslux> there's a lot i don't get and you could easily just start and ask real coding questions
[11:48:15] <RonaldsM> I don't have coding question, just the code that does not work
[11:48:40] <sillyslux> well then, better luck in #freelance
[11:49:19] <RonaldsM> nobody spares code
[11:49:23] <RonaldsM> thanks
[11:49:44] <RonaldsM> http://apaste.info/GRHNJ
[11:49:48] <RonaldsM> here is everything I know
[11:49:50] <RonaldsM> that works
[11:49:55] <sillyslux> or wait maybe somebody else will, later...
[11:50:23] <RonaldsM> can't You just for example make atleast ajax that work with api that has querys in my code
[11:50:44] <RonaldsM> I made comments in that code for reason
[11:52:33] <sillyslux> from http://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/ : $.get( "test.php", { name: "John", time: "2pm" } );
[11:52:43] <sillyslux> you don't understand it?
[11:53:12] <sillyslux> there really is not much to it
[11:54:34] <sillyslux> $.get( "someofyourscripts.php", { fromuser: couldevenbesetwithphp, tousere: idontknowyourlogic } );
[11:55:17] <RonaldsM> how that will display someofyourscripts.php
[11:57:22] <sillyslux> it won't, you can chain a .done method which will get the data your script returns
[11:57:39] <sillyslux> make it json
[11:57:56] <RonaldsM> can You for God sake, make one example that uses my code
[11:58:11] <RonaldsM> I am trying to get some code for 2 days
[11:58:50] <sillyslux> then why haven't you tried yourself? 2 days is more than enough to come up with something youself
[11:59:22] <sillyslux> why don't you just try $.get
[11:59:34] <sillyslux> like... now?
[11:59:39] <RonaldsM> can't You give me working example
[12:00:05] <sillyslux> $.get('script.php')
[12:00:15] <RonaldsM> wthel
[12:00:17] <RonaldsM> l
[12:00:21] <RonaldsM> I don't get
[12:00:38] <RonaldsM> http://apaste.info/iIApv
[12:04:36] <RonaldsM> $username  = $user_data['username']; if($username != $usernamechat){ echo $lietotajelements; }
[12:04:36] <RonaldsM> 	
[12:04:42] <RonaldsM> no value for username
[12:04:59] <RonaldsM> why is that
[12:06:31] <sillyslux> hm there, you use $('#outputusers').load('chatusers.php')
[12:07:16] <sillyslux> so, http://api.jquery.com/load/ says you can add somedata to that request
[12:07:22] <RonaldsM> how can I load chatusers with data I get from $_get
[12:08:01] <sillyslux> and it becomes something  like $('#outputusers').load('chatusers.php', {fromuser: nowwhat, touser: dunno})
[12:09:59] <RonaldsM> http://apaste.info/IHMku
[12:11:43] <sillyslux> CHATAPIS? is your php backend case-sensitive?
[12:11:57] <RonaldsM> http://apaste.info/zTkI9
[12:12:07] <jquery603> If I type 'aircraft' or 'airplane' or 'aeroplane' it will return 'good' ---> https://jsfiddle.net/gzrmvt7a/11/
[12:12:08] <RonaldsM> no that is just a folder
[12:12:42] <RonaldsM> something like in last code example?
[12:12:46] <RonaldsM> http://apaste.info/zTkI9
[12:12:59] <sillyslux> .load('CHATAPIS/chatmessages.php'), { touser: touservar }
[12:13:01] <sillyslux> you want
[12:13:13] <sillyslux> .load('CHATAPIS/chatmessages.php', { touser: touservar })
[12:14:22] <RonaldsM> but $username = $user_data['username'];
[12:14:25] <RonaldsM> is still empty
[12:14:50] <RonaldsM> cause somehow data does not read
[12:15:19] <sillyslux> somehow?
[12:15:38] <sillyslux> did your browser submit touser?
[12:16:06] <sillyslux> look in developertools -> network panel -> the according request
[12:16:37] <sillyslux> did your backend receive it? -> use a debugger or firephp or w/e
[12:17:03] <RonaldsM> no that is what database.php provides
[12:19:23] <RonaldsM> http://apaste.info/9NY79
[12:22:10] <RonaldsM> this example does not work
[12:25:24] <RonaldsM> but this one works, except for $username variable
[12:25:25] <RonaldsM> http://apaste.info/ol59B
[12:28:47] <sillyslux> maybe using a stepdebugger will help you with your php
[12:29:31] <sillyslux> then you can easily look up all available variables in every line of code
[12:30:02] <RonaldsM> open first example that does not work
[12:30:26] <sillyslux> it's open
[12:30:44] <RonaldsM> how on earth touser will get $search values
[12:31:16] <sillyslux> $search values is an array?
[12:32:02] <sillyslux> you can set variables for js this way `var touservar = <?php echo $search; ?>`
[12:32:04] <RonaldsM> it's just an variable
[12:32:13] <sillyslux> but don't forget your quotes!
[12:32:28] <RonaldsM> and how will my php script will read that
[12:32:48] <sillyslux> so a string in this case? then it's `var touservar = "<?php echo $search; ?>";`
[12:33:43] <sillyslux> your php? i don't know, what does database.php? does it provide $user_data?
[12:33:57] <RonaldsM> how will chatmessages.php read that
[12:34:13] <RonaldsM> it should provide $user_data
[12:34:36] <sillyslux> then you need $user_data = ....
[12:34:46] <sillyslux> not .... = $user_data
[12:35:15] <sillyslux> wait
[12:35:22] <RonaldsM> $username = $user_data['username'];
[12:35:29] <sillyslux> database.php gives you $user_data?
[12:35:35] <RonaldsM> yes
[12:36:00] <sillyslux> it needs username? now it's unset?
[12:36:05] <sillyslux> empty?
[12:36:25] <RonaldsM> yes it's what fromuser = ? takes data from
[12:36:58] <sillyslux> it's what?
[12:37:20] <sillyslux> username is what fromuser = ? takes data from??
[12:38:04] <RonaldsM> SELECT * FROM chat WHERE fromuser = ?
[12:38:20] <RonaldsM> execute(array($username
[12:38:28] <sigdk> I'm checking this plugin: https://jqueryvalidation.org/validate  It seems that all needed is a $(".selector").validate({ }); with some rules in there.  My question is. How exactly is validation triggered? When? Any experience?
[12:39:50] <RonaldsM> I don't understand how touser get data from 	.load('CHATAPIS/chatmessages.php', { touser: touservar })
[12:40:25] <RonaldsM> $querijszina = $db->prepare("SELECT * FROM chat WHERE fromuser = ? AND touser = ? ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 200");
[12:40:26] <RonaldsM> $querijszina->execute(array($username, $search));
[12:40:37] <sillyslux> that should become $_GET['touser'] on server side
[12:40:42] <RonaldsM> touser gets data from $search
[12:40:49] <RonaldsM> oh
[12:41:37] <RonaldsM> ok now I get
[12:41:45] <sillyslux> use a php debugger and then you can click through all available variables
[12:42:00] <RonaldsM> I will try to preset $username
[12:42:04] <RonaldsM> and see if
[12:46:01] <RonaldsM> when I preset $username as Ronalds and open CHATAPIS/chatmessages
[12:46:12] <RonaldsM> I echo $username and Ronalds show up
[12:46:22] <RonaldsM> but $search is empty
[12:46:59] <RonaldsM> I suppose .load function should load something into $search
[12:47:46] <RonaldsM> as You said it should
[12:48:51] <RonaldsM> $search = $_GET['touser'];
[12:50:20] <RonaldsM> but no messages get outputed even if I preset $username = 'Ronalds';
[12:51:29] <RonaldsM> it should give me SELECT * FROM chat WHERE fromuser = 'Ronalds' AND touser = 'otheruser' ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 200
[12:51:39] <RonaldsM> and there should be output
[12:51:43] <RonaldsM> but there isn't
[12:53:05] <sillyslux> so there's an issue with php, as i said, use a debugger and step through your code
[12:53:28] <RonaldsM> it works when I use these querys and don't load them as apis
[12:56:49] <RonaldsM> http://apaste.info/T6vSz
[12:56:53] <RonaldsM> this is how I tried it
[12:56:56] <RonaldsM> now
[12:57:17] <RonaldsM> $lietotajs = $username
[12:57:23] <RonaldsM> sorry  for mistake
[12:58:22] <sillyslux> fromuser = ? AND touser = ?
[12:58:31] <sillyslux> ah
[12:59:33] <sillyslux> holy... this is so confusing
[13:00:10] <RonaldsM> http://apaste.info/Hpu0k
[13:00:49] <RonaldsM> it should load now, because $username loads on chat.php
[13:01:02] <RonaldsM> or $lietotajs
[13:06:25] <RonaldsM> ah no I get
[13:09:00] <PlanC> does anyone know why this doesn't work?
[13:09:01] <PlanC> http://jsbin.com/nowoqupagi/edit?html,output
[13:09:31] <PlanC> I can't pass the parameter value from the function to the jQuery CSS
[13:12:21] <sillyslux> boxColor('backgroundColor');
[13:12:50] <sillyslux> and     $("#box").css({[parameter]: 'blue'});
[13:13:23] <sillyslux> but [parameter]: 'blue' is ES6, so supported in ~70% of browsers
[13:13:26] <PlanC> ah the brackets did the trick
[13:14:02] <PlanC> is there any other way that I can do it to get more browsers to support it?
[13:14:38] <sillyslux> you can define the object first and then just call $("#box").css(obj);
[13:15:22] <PlanC> won't "obj" just have the same problem?
[13:15:35] <sillyslux> var obj={}; obj[parameter]='blue';
[13:15:48] <sillyslux> this is ES5
[13:16:01] <inky_> how can i preventDefault for Firefox and Chrome for a keydown?
[13:16:02] <PlanC> ah right that's clever
[13:16:17] <PlanC> sillyslux, thanks for the help I'll try the latter method out
[13:16:45] <sillyslux> inky_, have you tried e.preventDefault()?
[13:19:44] <RonaldsM> problem was database was not in same folder as CHATAPIS
[13:19:50] <RonaldsM> now it's gone
[13:20:10] <RonaldsM> but those two variables still don't get values from .load
[13:20:48] <inky_> sillyslux: e.preventDefault: it works in Chrome, but not in Firefox :(
[13:21:34] <PlanC> sillyslux, I tried the ES5 way and it seems to be doing the trick
[13:21:36] <PlanC> thanks again
[13:25:01] <RonaldsM> https://s22.postimg.org/3x5hv2yf5/howitlookslike.png
[13:25:06] <RonaldsM> this is how it looks like
[13:25:14] <RonaldsM> chat box is populated with data
[13:25:19] <RonaldsM> but messages are not
[13:29:07] <RonaldsM> http://apaste.info/WpngD
[13:29:23] <sillyslux> RonaldsM, what you do might be prone for sql injections, are you sure you know what you are doing?
[13:29:36] <RonaldsM> yes
[13:29:50] <RonaldsM> only logged users could do sql injection
[13:29:58] <RonaldsM> plus, only on that table
[13:30:10] <sillyslux> that's a good start!
[13:30:25] <RonaldsM> but why data is not populated in messages
[13:31:13] <sillyslux> RonaldsM, do you smoke?
[13:31:28] <RonaldsM> nope
[13:31:34] <sillyslux> i do
[13:31:38] <sillyslux> but i don't
[13:31:53] <sillyslux> i'll go and get some tabacco
[13:31:59] <RonaldsM> cool
[13:32:11] <RonaldsM> I preffer weed
[13:32:28] <inky_> sillyslux: turns out it works in firefox, just not when writing alert() into the callback of the keypress o.o
[13:32:45] <sillyslux> oh!
[13:32:57] <sillyslux> funny
[13:33:22] <sillyslux> alert() is something we're not supposed to use anyway
[13:33:38] <sillyslux> RonaldsM, what editor do you use?
[13:33:44] <RonaldsM> geany
[13:33:56] <sillyslux> is your server local/dev?
[13:34:06] <sillyslux> or are you fiddling with prod?
[13:35:02] <sillyslux> give the trial version of phpstorm or atom(+phpdebug) a try
[13:35:26] <RonaldsM> local
[13:38:32] <sillyslux> i've used geany myself for years, would really be nice if there was a php-debugger for geany
[13:40:11] <sillyslux> if this local server is a lamp then you install php-xdebug, there's also little configuration needed
[13:40:31] <sillyslux> then use the right editor
[13:40:41] <sillyslux> ftw
[13:41:02] <sillyslux> if you got 20 minutes, invest
[13:41:22] <sillyslux> i promise you, it'll pay
[13:45:55] <RonaldsM> I just checked out and both variables have data
[13:46:07] <RonaldsM> http://apaste.info/WpngD
[13:46:22] <RonaldsM> $searchchat has data and $username
[13:47:57] <RonaldsM> maybe later with that debugging
[13:48:14] <RonaldsM> I feel like that .load function ain't doing thing
[13:48:49] <sillyslux> are your browsers developer tools open?
[13:48:56] <sillyslux> look in network panel
[13:49:15] <sillyslux> there should be an entry for that .load call
[13:49:49] <sillyslux> with the get/post data that was attached to that request and the response it got from the server
[13:50:15] <RonaldsM> chatmessages?chat=otheruser?chat2=Ronalds is having no answer
[13:50:42] <sillyslux> then it should (maybe) be chatmessages.php?chat=otheruser?chat2=Ronalds
[13:51:27] <RonaldsM> no still no response
[13:51:44] <sillyslux> what, wait?!
[13:51:57] <sillyslux> chatmessages?chat=otheruser?chat2=Ronalds
[13:52:03] <sillyslux> where did that come from??
[13:52:20] <RonaldsM> I made it up
[13:52:21] <sillyslux> chatmessages.php?chat=otheruser&chat2=Ronalds
[13:52:26] <sillyslux> oh
[13:52:37] <RonaldsM> both are redirected to chatmessages?chat=otheruser?chat2=Ronalds
[13:52:54] <RonaldsM> cause I'm having clean urls
[13:53:09] <RonaldsM> anyway, most pages work anyway
[13:53:21] <sillyslux> so do post requests then
[13:57:04] <RonaldsM> what post requests?
[14:05:01] <RonaldsM> no php errors apear in log
[14:09:17] <RonaldsM> ok, so I tried with just one ?chat=Ronalds
[14:09:22] <RonaldsM> and it found my messages
[14:11:18] <RonaldsM> it cannot take both parameters
[14:14:46] <RonaldsM> why is that
[14:17:46] <Guest56079> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1832e8f20995d1edae3642c45738195d help me :'(
[14:19:37] <RonaldsM> chatmessages?chat=Ronalds&chat2=OtherUser kinda worked
[14:20:51] <RonaldsM> data repeated
[14:22:12] <giantjames> Does setTimeout work from WITHIN setInterval?
[14:26:49] <RonaldsM> sillyslux: data repeats because it's a loop with loop in
[14:27:07] <RonaldsM> but I need messages posted by id
[14:31:47] <sillyslux> is that an issue with your php?
[14:32:16] <RonaldsM> yes
[14:32:26] <RonaldsM> how I can make chat like posting
[14:44:41] <thundar> hello everyone, how would you go about cloning a jquery method into a new function so you can add an extra parameter?
[15:04:54] <RonaldsM> sillyslux: now I get messages when I do chatmessages?chat=otheruser&chat2=Ronalds
[15:05:23] <sillyslux> is that good or bad?
[15:05:34] <RonaldsM> but no messages polluted from .load('chatmessages.php', { chat: touservar, chat2:fromuservar  })
[15:05:39] <RonaldsM> it's good
[15:06:02] <sillyslux> glad to hear that :)
[15:06:20] <RonaldsM> maybe those parameters isn't loaded
[15:16:38] <jquery911> this code dont execute on my webpage --> https://jsfiddle.net/u7yb0hh0/
[15:19:35] <jquery911> fixed it with delay
[15:27:15] <RonaldsM> http://apaste.info/QdY22
[15:27:30] <RonaldsM> sillyslux: I have problem with this script
[15:29:41] <RonaldsM> chatmessages?chat=Ronalds&chat2=OtherUser now work perfectly, it has some upgraded logic
[15:32:37] <sillyslux> "this does not send chat and chat2 values to chatmessages.php"?
[15:33:25] <RonaldsM> chatmessages?chat=Ronalds&chat2=OtherUser this works
[15:33:42] <verax5> any idea why this wot trigger toggle even?
[15:33:43] <RonaldsM> but  .load('chatmessages.php', { chat: touservar, chat2:fromuservar  }) dont
[15:33:44] <verax5> event*
[15:33:45] <verax5>       <span> <a id="contact" onclick="toggleContactForm()" href="">Contact Form</a> </span>
[15:33:47] <sillyslux> wait... what?! .load('chatmessages.php'
[15:34:03] <RonaldsM> yes,what ?
[15:34:03] <sillyslux> you want $(something).load(....
[15:34:37] <RonaldsM> http://apaste.info/QdY22
[15:34:53] <RonaldsM> this is the code
[15:35:01] <sillyslux> also... you use .load to retrieve html, that will then be inserted into $(element)
[15:35:36] <sillyslux> if you request some json, you go the .get/.post/.ajax ways
[15:35:46] <verax5> any idea why this wouldnt work guys?
[15:35:46] <verax5> http://laravel.io/bin/nQ7Ea
[15:37:03] <RonaldsM> sillyslux: Please change my code
[15:37:13] <RonaldsM> I don't get how it should look
[15:37:51] <sillyslux> RonaldsM, i don't know what and how and where
[15:38:07] <RonaldsM> I just gave You the code
[15:38:39] <verax5> ronald can ya help ps?
[15:38:40] <verax5> pease
[15:39:07] <sillyslux> verax5, your html onclick=...  expects the function to be global, but you defined the function in a scope, so it's unreachable like that
[15:39:46] <RonaldsM> why  it does not load nothing on
[15:39:47] <RonaldsM> 			.load('chatmessages.php', { chat: touservar, chat2:fromuservar  })
[15:39:54] <sillyslux> better do some jquery $('')
[15:40:11] <verax5> by scope you mean thing silly?
[15:40:12] <verax5> $(function(){
[15:40:12] <RonaldsM> chatmessages?chat=Ronalds&chat2=OtherUser loads
[15:40:29] <sillyslux> better do some jquery $('#contact').click(function(e){e.preventDefault();alert('wtf')})
[15:40:38] <sillyslux> yes
[15:40:59] <verax5> silly i removed that jquery is ready bit: $(function(){
[15:41:02] <verax5> but it still doesnt work
[15:41:11] <verax5> guess i will do that ure suggesting
[15:41:21] <sillyslux> RonaldsM, $ and jQuery are things with a .load method
[15:41:40] <sillyslux> but you try to use it like in thin air
[15:41:53] <sillyslux> .load should give you an error in your console
[15:41:56] <sillyslux> does it?
[15:42:14] <RonaldsM> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token .
[15:42:43] <sillyslux> see
[15:43:18] <RonaldsM> then what it should look like
[15:45:01] <sillyslux> puh, you're polling every second for new messages?
[15:45:47] <sillyslux> what does your server send? html, like prerendered? or json with just data?
[15:46:49] <RonaldsM> html
[15:47:32] <sillyslux> hmm .load will replace the html in the box, you probably want to append
[15:47:38] <RonaldsM> https://s22.postimg.org/3x5hv2yf5/howitlookslike.png
[15:48:01] <sillyslux> you already posted that
[15:48:02] <RonaldsM> yes I know
[15:48:11] <RonaldsM> thats because getting usernames work
[15:48:25] <RonaldsM> getting messages don't because I have those two parameters
[15:48:52] <sillyslux> and by parameters you mean chat and chat2?
[15:48:53] <RonaldsM> $username and $otheruserusername
[15:48:57] <RonaldsM> yes
[15:49:37] <sillyslux> can you access these 2 parameters in php?
[15:49:44] <RonaldsM> yes
[15:50:36] <RonaldsM> I am going out with the dogg
[15:50:42] <RonaldsM> later
[15:51:05] <sillyslux> try $.get('chatmessages.php', { chat: touservar, chat2:fromuservar  }).then(function(data){console.log(data)})
[15:53:50] <verax5> Could someone help?
[15:53:51] <verax5> http://laravel.io/bin/Jx8WE
[15:53:56] <verax5> Trying toggle
[15:54:04] <verax5> but not able to change inner text of an element on clicks
[16:01:19] <sigdk> $("#myForm").serialize()   is that a standard jquery method?   Seems to work even if I don't specify names to the elements (it uses ids)
[16:06:51] <RonaldsM> 			.load('chatmessages.php?chat='+fromuservar'&'+touservar'', { chat: touservar, chat2:fromuservar  })
[16:07:05] <RonaldsM> maybe something like this would work
[16:13:24] <RonaldsM> $.get('chatmessages.php', { chat: touservar, chat2:fromuservar  }).then(function(data){console.log(data)})
[16:18:17] <RonaldsM> like this

[16:22:22] <RonaldsM> chat:1092 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token .

[16:52:00] <RonaldsM> http://apaste.info/MtqEa
[16:52:01] <taplar> impolite
[16:52:04] <taplar> whatever the word
[16:52:35] <RonaldsM> so this was the line .load('chatmessages.php', { chat: touservar, chat2:fromuservar  })	
[16:52:40] <RonaldsM> whats wrong with it
[16:52:52] <taplar> the api shows many examples of the usage of that function
[16:53:57] <RonaldsM> what
[16:54:15] <taplar> i liked to the api page for load().  have you read it?
[16:54:17] <hellyeah> you can be sure if you dont fix that line you will stuck with more
[16:54:18] <taplar> *linked
[16:54:46] <RonaldsM> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/263962/best-way-to-pass-parameters-to-jquerys-load
[16:54:53] <taplar> that's not the api

[16:55:09] <RonaldsM> what api
[16:55:16] <sillyslux> it's exactly *not
[16:55:19] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/load/

[16:55:41] <RonaldsM> omg
[16:55:43] * sillyslux throws in some api for everybody
[16:56:05] <hellyeah> Robdgreat:  you still dont have any clue :D
[16:56:08] <sillyslux> what does the error message tell you?
[16:56:41] <sillyslux> hellyeah, random ping?
[16:56:45] <taplar> lol
[16:58:00] <taplar> man you guys are rowdy for a sunday
[16:58:07] <RonaldsM> http://apaste.info/S5oQX
[16:58:11] <taplar> i was checking logs figuring it was going to be a ghost town
[16:58:12] <sillyslux> give it a sec and get another apaste link
[16:58:17] <hellyeah> random ping?
[16:58:39] <RonaldsM> what is wrong with the code
[16:58:44] <taplar> "almost the same" isn't the same
[16:58:52] <taplar> ln your still using load() improperly
[16:59:01] <hellyeah> what console say to you RonaldsM
[16:59:04] <RonaldsM> where
[16:59:08] <taplar> ln 8
[16:59:15] <RonaldsM> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token .
[16:59:28] <RonaldsM> .load('chatmessages.php', { chat: touservar, chat2:fromuservar  })	
[16:59:29] <taplar> where in the api do you see the use of ".load" off of nothing?
[16:59:43] <RonaldsM> chatmessages.php exist
[16:59:45] <RonaldsM> and works
[16:59:48] <taplar> your not listening
[16:59:54] <RonaldsM> what api
[17:00:04] <taplar> i've linked it twice
[17:00:05] <RonaldsM> it's monday now
[17:00:11] <RonaldsM> damn
[17:00:23] <RonaldsM> can't You give atleast part of of the line of the code
[17:00:31] <taplar> why when you can go to the page?
[17:00:37] <RonaldsM> I was there
[17:01:07] <taplar> and you have an example on ln 26 of a proper use of load
[17:01:13] <taplar> it's not calling load off of nothing
[17:01:37] <RonaldsM> damn what is nothing
[17:01:53] <taplar> your doing .load with nothing in front of the period
[17:01:55] <RonaldsM> 			.load('chatmessages.php') { chat: touservar, chat2:fromuservar  })
[17:01:56] <taplar> no jQuery object
[17:02:03] <RonaldsM> I'm just guessing
[17:02:07] <sillyslux> there's nothingness infront of .load
[17:02:17] <taplar> load is jQuery.fn.load
[17:02:23] <taplar> it must be called off of a jQuery object
[17:02:37] <RonaldsM> I don't understand
[17:02:54] <taplar> how's it supossed to know where to load what it gets from the request?
[17:02:54] <RonaldsM> CAN YOU GIVE OBJECT AND WHERE I SHOULD Put it
[17:02:56] <taplar> no
[17:03:14] <RonaldsM> another waster of time
[17:03:28] <RonaldsM> everyone is so big in there spirit,
[17:03:32] <taplar> your not reading the api and your ignoring everyones advice.  how can we help you if your not trying?
[17:03:34] <RonaldsM> can't give a line of code
[17:03:42] <RonaldsM> what advice
[17:03:43] <taplar> we're not here to do it for you
[17:03:48] <RonaldsM> life hurted You
[17:03:52] <sillyslux> try $('#outputmessages').load
[17:04:25] <RonaldsM> oh
[17:04:29] <RonaldsM> ok
[17:04:34] <hellyeah> :D
[17:04:47] <RonaldsM> chat?chat=BiscuitShop:1091 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token {
[17:05:04] <hellyeah> dude
[17:05:14] <hellyeah> you shouldnt ask that kind of error here
[17:05:20] <hellyeah> imo :D
[17:05:33] <hellyeah> did you fiddle it?
[17:05:39] <RonaldsM> http://apaste.info/oND8P
[17:06:03] <hellyeah> dude jsfiddle not paste site
[17:06:36] <taplar> {} is outside your load() call
[17:07:08] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/zbsgz2yh/
[17:07:31] <sillyslux> RonaldsM, there's resourceful http://learn.jquery.com/ if you want to learn jquery and http://eloquentjavascript.net/ if you want to learn js
[17:08:48] <hellyeah> eloquent is javascript i supposed
[17:08:54] <hellyeah> yes
[17:08:58] <hellyeah> first learn javascript
[17:09:02] <RonaldsM> 		$('#outputmessages').load('chatmessages.php', { chat: touservar, chat2:fromuservar  })
[17:09:07] <RonaldsM> this is correct?
[17:09:15] <taplar> syntatically, yes
[17:09:47] <RonaldsM> 404:2 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <
[17:10:27] <sillyslux> so you gonna paste every damn error you ever get on the console... :(
[17:10:41] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/zbsgz2yh/1/
[17:10:45] <hellyeah> muahhaha
[17:11:04] <hellyeah> < mean dont paste that kind of error
[17:11:08] <hellyeah> it is iritating
[17:11:10] <taplar> well it's not going to work on jsfiddle like that because jsfiddle doesn't understand php
[17:11:12] <hellyeah> believe me
[17:11:18] <RonaldsM> I know
[17:11:39] <RonaldsM> so why it doesn't load data from my php file
[17:11:50] <taplar> on your real page?
[17:12:25] <RonaldsM> yes
[17:12:27] <taplar> also is this logic generated from php?
[17:12:28] <sillyslux> because there's an " Uncaught SyntaxError"
[17:12:43] <RonaldsM> from what
[17:12:50] <taplar> this page with the js in it
[17:12:55] <sillyslux> from an unexpected `<`
[17:13:07] <RonaldsM> where is unexpected <
[17:13:32] <RonaldsM> var touservar = "<?php echo $searchchat; ?>";
[17:14:04] <sillyslux> this is in somefile.php?
[17:14:10] <taplar> ^
[17:14:29] <sillyslux> then no
[17:14:34] <sillyslux> somewhere else
[17:15:54] <verax5> section show vs endsection?
[17:16:00] <verax5> any difference?
[17:16:09] <verax5> ops wrong channel
[17:18:03] <RonaldsM> hah
[17:18:19] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/zbsgz2yh/1/
[17:18:44] <RonaldsM> how should I write those variables then
[17:18:56] <taplar> is that logic generated from a php script?
[17:18:57] <RonaldsM> var fromuservar = <?php echo $lietotajs3; ?>;
[17:19:03] <RonaldsM> what logic
[17:19:11] <taplar> this logic in the fiddle
[17:19:19] <taplar> what kind of file is generating it?
[17:19:31] <sillyslux> https://s22.postimg.org/3x5hv2yf5/howitlookslike.png
[17:20:20] <RonaldsM> what is generating what
[17:20:30] <taplar> this markup and js that your showing
[17:20:39] <RonaldsM> I don't understand You
[17:20:47] <taplar> it's in some kinda file.  html, js, php, something
[17:20:56] <RonaldsM> php file

[17:22:07] <sillyslux> yeah, i'm in it for 6hrs now :D
[17:22:14] <sillyslux> feels a bit like https://twitter.com/iamdevloper/status/793139937071788032
[17:22:50] <RonaldsM> You could give lines of working code
[17:23:00] <taplar> ln 5 and 6
[17:23:06] <taplar> what shows up in the ""?
[17:23:22] <RonaldsM> wait

[17:24:16] <taplar> ?
[17:24:16] <RonaldsM> show *
[17:24:26] <taplar> so it's not being returned to your front end?
[17:25:20] <RonaldsM> ok it shows
[17:25:39] <RonaldsM> https://jsfiddle.net/zbsgz2yh/2/
[17:26:07] <taplar> cool, so now, look at your network tab
[17:26:15] <taplar> you should see that request firing every second
[17:26:42] <RonaldsM> yes, because of my other .load
[17:26:57] <taplar> you have two loads?
[17:27:31] <RonaldsM> Yes, should I deleted other one for second?
[17:27:36] <taplar> please
[17:27:43] <taplar> or just comment it out
[17:27:57] <PlanC> what are you guys doing?
[17:28:04] <RonaldsM> still sends
[17:28:13] <PlanC> ronald was trying to create some chat system when I checked in 4 hours ago
[17:28:15] <taplar> so your load you have is firing, yes?
[17:28:28] <RonaldsM> ys
[17:28:46] <taplar> and if you inspect it (by clicking on it) you should see your inputs on the request parameters, yes?
[17:30:05] <RonaldsM> yes
[17:30:17] <taplar> so cool, your load request is working
[17:30:41] <hellyeah> YAY
[17:30:47] <RonaldsM> it shows just chatmessages.php
[17:30:57] <taplar> ?
[17:30:59] <RonaldsM> no parameters
[17:31:12] <taplar> there should be a tab for request paramaeters or request or something
[17:31:19] <taplar> depending on your browser
[17:31:31] <taplar> ( after clicking one of the requests )
[17:31:45] <RonaldsM> chromium
[17:32:00] <taplar> ok, in chrome i think it shows it all together, you'll just have to scroll down
[17:34:56] <RonaldsM> https://s15.postimg.org/8p8i2mp57/networkstatistics.png
[17:35:19] <taplar> right, now click one of those 'chatmessages.php' rows
[17:35:29] <taplar> something should show up on the right hand side
[17:35:36] <RonaldsM> failed to load response data
[17:35:55] <Pachuca> hi
[17:36:03] <taplar> look for the request headers, request data
[17:36:03] <RonaldsM> chat:
[17:36:03] <RonaldsM> chat2:Ronalds
[17:36:11] <taplar> boom
[17:36:31] <Pachuca> am I in the right chat. Is this for java related topics?
[17:36:41] <taplar> Pachuca: no this is jQuery support
[17:36:52] <Pachuca> oh
[17:37:04] <taplar> did you mean 'java' or 'javascript' ?
[17:37:54] <Pachuca> i'm new to all of this, i guess javascript
[17:38:04] <taplar> k, then you should try ##javascript
[17:38:09] <Pachuca> i'm having a hard time trying to figure out how to pull some data off a website
[17:38:19] <Pachuca> ok, ty
[17:38:59] <RonaldsM> boom what now it shows both
[17:39:09] <RonaldsM> chat:User1
[17:39:09] <RonaldsM> chat2:Ronalds
[17:39:10] <Pachuca> also, what's the freenode community chat? I would like to register my nickname, but i'm not sure where to do that
[17:39:23] <taplar> RonaldsM: then the request is being executed as you expected
[17:39:31] <taplar> Pachuca: #freenode
[17:39:46] <Pachuca> ty
[17:39:48] <RonaldsM> no data is retrieved
[17:39:55] <taplar> you can also /msg NickServ
[17:40:10] <taplar> RonaldsM: that's a different issue.  that's a issue with the script your calling
[17:40:47] <RonaldsM> script does return data
[17:40:57] <taplar> i thought you said no data is retrieved
[17:41:31] <taplar> if you click the response tab, what shows?
[17:41:37] <RonaldsM> not with .load
[17:42:07] <taplar> if the page is returning data it will show in the response of the request
[17:42:32] <RonaldsM> failed to response data
[17:42:42] <taplar> so the backend is not returning anything
[17:43:03] <RonaldsM> chat:user1 chat2:Ronalds
[17:43:14] <taplar> that's the input, no?
[17:43:20] <RonaldsM> but I go to backend page and it is working
[17:43:23] <taplar> we're talking about the output of the request
[17:43:35] <RonaldsM> chatmessages?chat=Ronalds&chat2=user1
[17:43:37] <RonaldsM> shows data
[17:44:02] <taplar> in that request in the network tab, when you click on one and you look at the response tab.  is it or is it not showing any data?
[17:44:20] <RonaldsM> both ways chatmessages?chat=user1&chat2=Ronalds
[17:44:33] <taplar> that is showing up in the response?
[17:44:40] <RonaldsM> no
[17:44:45] <taplar> that's what i'm asking
[17:44:49] <taplar> lol
[17:44:58] <RonaldsM> in response tab it shows failed to respond
[17:45:02] <taplar> ok
[17:45:09] <taplar> so the request failed for some reason
[17:45:15] <taplar> you gotta figure out why
[17:45:59] <taplar> hold on
[17:46:08] <taplar> chat:user1 chat2:Ronalds  is on the request?
[17:46:16] <RonaldsM> yes
[17:46:23] <taplar> but chatmessages?chat=Ronalds&chat2=user1 works?
[17:46:45] <taplar> look at those key values
[17:47:11] <RonaldsM> that is what yes
[17:47:16] <hellyeah> is that query string?
[17:47:19] <taplar> right look at them
[17:47:26] <RonaldsM> that query string works
[17:47:26] <taplar> one works, one doesn't.  what's different?
[17:47:42] <RonaldsM> I don't know
[17:47:46] <RonaldsM> both same
[17:47:47] <taplar> nope
[17:47:55] <taplar> not at all
[17:48:00] <RonaldsM> how
[17:48:04] <taplar> you have your values transposed dude
[17:48:21] <RonaldsM> what that means
[17:48:24] <taplar> backwards
[17:48:36] <taplar> chat:user1
[17:48:40] <taplar> ?chat=Ronalds
[17:48:51] <RonaldsM> I told it works both ways
[17:49:02] <hellyeah> isnt it query string syntax
[17:49:11] <RonaldsM> chatmessages?chat=user1&chat2=Ronalds works too
[17:49:12] <taplar> the ? is
[17:49:14] <hellyeah> ?something&otherthing
[17:49:26] <hellyeah> i suppose & used for "and"
[17:49:31] <taplar> ya
[17:49:35] <hellyeah> i mean there is two parameters
[17:49:47] <taplar> RonaldsM: then i dunno why the load is failing when the straight request is.
[17:49:50] <RonaldsM> I need to add parameter with &
[17:49:57] <hellyeah> i follow the conversation i sense i will learn something here
[17:50:18] <taplar> RonaldsM: if it's showing those key value pairs on the request in the network inspector, they should be being sent to the backend
[17:50:37] <RonaldsM> yes, I understand that
[17:52:47] <taplar> and the path to chatmessages.php is correct?
[17:52:56] <taplar> in the network tab
[17:53:52] <RonaldsM> yes
[17:53:56] <taplar> :s
[17:54:09] <taplar> ok, for shiggles, try taking off the '.php' part
[17:54:46] <hellyeah> :D:D:D
[17:55:21] <RonaldsM> 		$('#outputmessages').load('chatmessages', { chat: touservar, chat2:fromuservar  })
[17:55:25] <taplar> ya
[17:56:03] <taplar> chatmessages?chat=user1&chat2=Ronalds  doesn't have the php part so i'm just spitballing at this point
[17:56:26] <RonaldsM> ok, I took it off, data still does not load
[17:56:38] <taplar> but does it show up in the response tab?
[17:57:53] <RonaldsM> response tab is emty
[17:57:56] <RonaldsM> empty
[17:58:13] <taplar> actually that pic you gave before showed your requests were getting a 301
[17:58:19] <taplar> that's a redirect
[17:58:56] <taplar> so put your .php back on and figure out why your getting that redirect
[17:59:10] <RonaldsM> from where
[17:59:17] <taplar> the server is redirecting you
[17:59:21] <taplar> for some reason
[18:01:17] <taplar> oooh, question
[18:01:28] <taplar> how is your php file trying to get chat and chat2?
[18:01:46] <taplar> $_GET or $_POST or $_REQUEST?
[18:02:21] <RonaldsM> I get 200
[18:02:30] <RonaldsM> when .php is off
[18:02:50] <taplar> and to my last question ?
[18:02:54] <hellyeah> 200 is nice number
[18:03:51] <RonaldsM> $_get
[18:03:55] <hellyeah> it must be $_GET right
[18:03:56] <taplar> :D
[18:04:15] <taplar> look at the method type on thoese chatmessages calls
[18:04:51] <RonaldsM> Request Method:POST
[18:05:20] <taplar> from the api: "The POST method is used if data is provided as an object; otherwise, GET is assumed."
[18:06:06] <RonaldsM> isn't it's provided as object
[18:06:15] <taplar> it is
[18:06:20] <taplar> {} is an object
[18:06:44] <hellyeah> you need an object so send smt to backend i assume
[18:08:35] <RonaldsM> object is chat:user1, chat2:Ronalds
[18:08:46] <taplar> try changing it to a string: https://jsfiddle.net/k9a4629e/
[18:09:34] <RonaldsM> chat=me&chat2=you
[18:09:45] <taplar> right, use $.param on the object your giving to load
[18:10:00] <taplar> so it will be a string instead of an object and see if that makes load use GET instead of POST
[18:10:49] <RonaldsM> Request Method:POST
[18:11:03] <taplar> show me what you changed?
[18:11:08] <RonaldsM> 		$('#outputmessages').load('chatmessages', { chat: 'touservar', chat2:'fromuservar'  })
[18:11:17] <taplar> $.param isn't in there...
[18:11:54] <RonaldsM> please write how it should look like
[18:12:01] <RonaldsM> I don't get what $.param
[18:12:07] <taplar> look at that fiddle i gave
[18:12:12] <taplar> it take and {}
[18:12:22] <taplar> whatever you want to convert to a query string
[18:12:30] <taplar> in this case it's your chat chat2 object
[18:12:50] <RonaldsM> 		$('#outputmessages').load('chatmessages', $.param({ chat: 'touservar', chat2:'fromuservar'  }))
[18:12:54] <taplar> yep
[18:13:10] <taplar> oh, take off the '' around your variables
[18:13:19] <RonaldsM> Request Method:GET
[18:13:22] <taplar> boom!
[18:13:50] <RonaldsM> owned
[18:13:52] <RonaldsM> it works now
[18:13:55] <RonaldsM> messages show
[18:13:55] <taplar> :)
[18:15:14] <RonaldsM> now I only need form that loads data into database without reloading, and some javascript function that scrools down msg_body
[18:15:23] <RonaldsM> but that's for tommorow
[18:15:30] <RonaldsM> it's 1 at night again
[18:18:30] <hellyeah> actually $_load is same with $_ajax right
[18:18:42] <taplar> load is a wrapper for ajax
[18:18:53] <taplar> provided you give it a url and not a function
[18:19:20] <taplar> but it's more than just a basic wrapper as it does other things
[18:20:24] <hellyeah> other things?_
[18:20:40] <taplar> look what it did in regards there to using either GET/POST depending upon input
[18:20:51] <taplar> also if used like that it takes the response and puts it in the dom
[18:20:59] <taplar> normal ajax doesn't do that
[18:22:41] <hellyeah> so the thing i need to use $_load instead of _ajax
[18:22:43] <hellyeah> ?
[18:23:01] <taplar> no, you use load when you need to do specifically what it does
[18:23:10] <taplar> otherwise just use ajax
[18:24:17] <taplar> it's like buying food vs getting take out
[18:24:24] <RonaldsM> ok till tommorow, when I get back from job
[18:24:55] <taplar> in both cases your getting fed, but getting take out is a specific way to get fed
[18:25:15] <taplar> where as when you buy food, it's up to you what to do after that point
[18:25:16] <RonaldsM> lol
[18:25:41] <taplar> best analogy i can think of on the spot, :D
[18:28:13] <hellyeah> :D
[18:28:16] <RonaldsM> ok good night
[18:28:20] <hellyeah> dont eat much
[18:28:24] <hellyeah> you become fat
