[09:37:48] <snackoverflow> im trying to get the sidebar nav buttons to work at hendrixia.herokuapp.com. what's the difference (in code) between the herokuapp link i just linked and https://mdbootstrap.com/snippets/jquery/mdbootstrap/98648 -- the latter does the desired behavior (click a sidebar nav button, it expands)
[10:11:34] <Cesar98> Hi guys, I not sure if here is the right channel to ask this, but jqueryui themeroller is unable to download custom package. I am receiving an error from CloudFlare.
[10:13:42] <dushyant> hi
[10:14:57] <dushyant> If I am selecting something like:  $(this).nextUntil('.class1').css(... ) ;    is there a way to select its inverse?
[10:40:59] <Uhkis> prevUntil ?
[10:45:40] <Hopplahase> Isn't there something to skip elements until a certain selector and select all the rest? A combination of .nextUntil() and .not() works, but there must be something nicer
[10:51:39] <Hopplahase> This works https://jsbin.com/deyayanuno/1/edit?html,js,output
[10:53:04] <Uhkis> why not start from the bar?
[10:54:24] <Hopplahase> How?
[10:55:06] <Uhkis> well your example did, it wasn't really related to your question

[19:52:41] <xae-x12> Hi I am trying to convert the top jquery code to vanilla javascript at the bottom but the refresh link is not showing up? https://dpaste.org/VbJ8
