[03:14:04] <inthl> say I have 100 elements on my page with .myclass - now I want to perform some effect, e.g. fadeIn. that works with $('.myclass').fadeIn(); very fine. now I have a specific problem there: using a success handler, with fadeIn(100, function() { --that-part-here }); ..becomes fired 100 times then. Is there a way to WAIT for finishing with the animation, but to have this fired only once?
[03:15:13] <Cork> inthl: $.when($('.myclass').fadeIn().promise()).done(function() {});
[03:15:49] <inthl> news to me. give me a minute to try. thanks :>
[03:16:03] <Cork> hmm, wait you don't need .promise
[03:16:13] <Cork> inthl: $.when($('.myclass').fadeIn()).done(function() {}); should work now days
[03:16:41] <inthl> hm
[03:17:17] <Cork> the important part is to use $.when() to wait for all the callbacks to fire
[03:21:15] <inthl> uh, seems to work. thank you very much
[04:08:19] <midori-rus> Hello. How to send ajax POST request using absolute path? http://laravel.io/bin/yGrV3 It always sends using relating path
[04:08:46] <Cork> midori-rus: uh, it shouldn't
[04:09:24] <Cork> an url with / should be read as an absolute path by the browser
[04:09:38] <Cork> this isn't handled by jquery, not even javascript does it
[04:09:43] <Cork> it is just a string to them
[04:10:26] <midori-rus> Cork: I want to send from /products/ to /variants/ my request. Is it possible?
[04:11:21] <Cork> if the current path is http://example.com/something/something-else/products and you want to post to http://example.com/variants
[04:11:32] <Cork> url: '/variants/' should do that
[04:11:49] <Cork> it is part of the url spec
[04:11:58] <Cork> all browsers i know of follow it
[04:12:09] <Cork> (and they have to cause else they wouldn't be web compatible)
[04:14:05] <midori-rus> Cork: I tried like that url: '/admin/variants/' + variantButton,
[04:14:31] <Cork> if you want http://example.com/admin/variants/100 that should do it
[04:15:16] <midori-rus> Cork: sorry, I've fixed that. It was my bad
[05:06:45] <XaroRAS> Hi
[05:07:14] <XaroRAS> if I have a event binded like this
[05:07:37] <XaroRAS> outerParent.on('click', '.btn[value="save"]' , _saveItem );
[05:08:16] <XaroRAS> can I pass to the _saveItem a another selector eg: .itemParent
[05:21:49] <Cork> XaroRAS: you can wrap it in an anonymous function
[05:21:56] <Cork> or you can use event data
[05:23:04] <Cork> XaroRAS: outerParent.on('click', '.btn[value="save"]', '.itemParent' , _saveItem ); function _saveItem(event) { event.data }
[05:24:18] <XaroRAS> mmm
[05:24:58] <XaroRAS> will this work .itemParent are dynamic dom elements (they get added or removed)?
[05:27:36] <XaroRAS> there is a list of items in the OuterParent
[05:27:57] <XaroRAS> these items can be added and remove via buttons INSIDE the items
[05:28:19] <XaroRAS> so its OuterParent > Item > *buttons
[05:29:13] <XaroRAS> and the *buttons add or remove OuterParent > [clickedbutton].item
[05:32:03] <XaroRAS> Omg it works!
[05:32:22] <XaroRAS> Thanks Cork!!
[05:33:55] <Cork> XaroRAS: that syntax is called delegation
[05:34:09] <Cork> XaroRAS: it means the event handler is bound to outerParent not the one matched by the selector
[05:34:11] <XaroRAS> o wait no its not working
[05:34:20] <XaroRAS> yes i understand
[05:34:21] <Cork> so as long as there is a child matching the selector it will work
[05:34:36] <Cork> what is it you want to do?
[05:34:40] <XaroRAS> Yes i understand the delegation
[05:34:58] <XaroRAS> Each one of these items have buttons and calls a function
[05:35:04] <Cork> if you want to check for the itemParent inside the event handler just use $(this).closest('.itemParent')
[05:35:13] <XaroRAS> Yes
[05:35:15] <XaroRAS> exactly
[05:35:32] <Cork> no need to add that to the event binding
[05:35:33] <XaroRAS> but i was wondering if there is a better way than to do the .closest in each function
[05:35:42] <Cork> not really
[05:35:47] <XaroRAS> ok
[05:35:49] <XaroRAS> thats ok then
[05:35:54] <XaroRAS> just tried
[05:36:11] <XaroRAS> thought about using proxy??
[05:36:12] <XaroRAS> but nah
[05:36:22] <XaroRAS> if there isnt a clean and simple way then no problem
[05:36:22] <Cork> event.data is cleaner
[05:36:31] <Cork> proxy would kill "this"
[05:36:38] <Cork> and make life annoying
[05:37:02] <XaroRAS> ok no problem
[05:37:19] <Cork> XaroRAS: well the problem is that you want to bind the event to one element, but the "effect" to another
[05:37:29] <Cork> so either way you have to have code to handle that difference
[05:37:43] <Cork> either checking event.target == button and bind it to .itemParent
[05:37:46] <XaroRAS> yeah, or start using react or angular with data bindings
[05:37:50] <Cork> or bind it to the button and find the parent
[05:38:18] <XaroRAS> ok Thanks alot Cork
[05:38:22] <Cork> np
[05:38:29] <XaroRAS> can i add you somewhere?
[05:38:34] <XaroRAS> steam?
[05:38:39] <Cork> no
[05:38:44] <Cork> irc is my place :)
[05:38:52] <XaroRAS> sweet
[05:38:57] <XaroRAS> oldschool
[05:39:06] <Cork> kinda ya :)
[05:39:27] <XaroRAS> cool, im off to complete the code
[05:39:30] <XaroRAS> thanks again!
[05:39:32] <XaroRAS> Good day!

[07:25:46] <star_prone> hi
[07:26:37] <star_prone> I'm making an ajax request which receives a JSON having the format id=>name for a list of cities
[07:27:26] <star_prone> although the array used to create the JSON was sorted by name, jquery will rearrange the output by id
[07:27:40] <star_prone> do you any simple idea to stop it doing that?
[07:33:48] <jangoh> hai how do i filter isotope items on load
[07:34:48] <slax0r> stamina: id is just a number?
[07:34:55] <slax0r> and I'm assuming it's php
[07:35:09] <slax0r> just sort your array, and json_encode(array_values($yourSortedArray));
[07:35:31] <slax0r> oh wait, you probably need that ID, nevermind ^^
[07:40:25] <star_prone> slax0r: that is exactly what I'm doing
[07:41:52] <star_prone> the problem is that when I iterate the the JSON received, although it is properly arranged when I receive it, the options added in a select element are ordered by id instead of name
[08:23:57] <Pazician> How can I prevent this from jumping back to the section, I want it to stick to - 600px https://jsfiddle.net/edyccone/
[09:20:22] <wa5ted> Pazician: wut?
[09:21:23] <Pazician> wa5ted: When it was animating down it would jump back to the section, which annoys me, is there any way to prevent that and make it stick to that - 600 or w/e it would be? I like your nick btw, lol.
[09:21:54] <wa5ted> so example
[09:22:06] <wa5ted> if i spam a button to scroll to
[09:22:16] <wa5ted> then you want the animation to complete
[09:22:23] <wa5ted> before the next event is fired?
[09:22:52] <wa5ted> Pazician: http://discovercoolprogramming.blogspot.ca/2014/06/hey-so-i-came-across-something-rather.html
[09:22:54] <wa5ted> maybe this
[09:24:08] <Pazician> Right, that's what I'm looking for. But I want to - for e.g 100px from that section instead of using padding for that section, are you following?
[09:27:24] <taplar> alternative to that blog post, you could use one()
[09:31:35] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/1awaqwfj/
[09:34:13] <taplar> though that only works for throttling a single binding
[09:35:05] <wa5ted> Pazician: ssgin an id to the first element after the 100px padding and get the offset
[09:35:12] <wa5ted> alternatively you could calculate the offset of the section
[09:35:18] <wa5ted> find the sections padding and then apply it that way
[09:35:40] <Pazician> Alright, I'll try to figure it out - thank you all for helping out
[09:40:02] <taplar> haha!  you can do it with multiple with a delegate: https://jsfiddle.net/1awaqwfj/1/
[09:45:44] <taplar> i really don't want to sign in to googs just to leave a comment on this guys page though :/ heh
[10:08:07] <Bilel_mk> hi everyone can someone help ! how can i trace which part of my website " one page website " is more accessible with a jQuery plugin ?
[10:20:57] <Cork> Bilel_mk: what pare it more accessible?
[10:23:18] <Bilel_mk> Cork, yup something like that and which image of product viewed more
[10:24:15] <Cork> Bilel_mk: i have no clue what your asking for
[10:24:41] <basiclaser> I’m getting a stringified array of objects after using  $.ajax, how can i parse them back into objects?
[10:25:03] <basiclaser> Here’s the output I’m getting at the bottom under “server console output” https://ghostbin.com/paste/b6m5b
[10:25:05] <taplar> JSON.parse() or $.parseJSON()
[10:25:10] <Cork> basiclaser: if the server sets the correct content-type you don't have to
[10:25:19] <Cork> so fix the server and it would just work
[10:25:45] <basiclaser> interesting thanks ill try the jQuery method and check the schema
[10:25:45] <Bilel_mk> Cork, i have a one page website i want to know which part of my website is more visited
[10:26:12] <Cork> Bilel_mk: you would have to grab a analytic tool like ex. googla analytics
[10:26:15] <basiclaser> Cork: otherwise, just to allay my concerns, that stringified code you see in the link is normal yes?
[10:27:07] <Cork> basiclaser: well that isn't json so...
[10:27:14] <Cork> not sure what your outputting there
[10:28:01] <Bilel_mk> Cork, yes i want to make my own tool !
[10:28:02] <basiclaser> Cork: i just call $.ajax as you can see in the file on an object with arrays of objects inside. Should i be formatting the code prior to calling the $.ajax?
[10:42:41] <_TWG_> Can anyone help me with this error? Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience.
[10:44:16] <taplar> what are you doing?  sounds like your trying to do async false with an ajax request
[10:44:49] <_TWG_> Well this is the whole CSV thing I've been working on for over a week.
[10:47:00] <_TWG_> I'm trying to call individual CSV files and write them to an array for displaying on a page.
[10:57:42] <Duikb00t> Hello I need small help with the following:
[10:58:05] <Duikb00t> I have multiple hyperlink reference like: " <a href="#" class="square bg img1"> "  where only img changes like img1 img2, img3, img4...
[10:58:12] <Duikb00t> Now I want to detected which one is being clicked.
[10:58:34] <Duikb00t> How can I check which img is being clicked?
[10:58:49] <taplar> 'this' will reference the element the event handler is processing on
[10:58:59] <taplar> you can check the class(es) on it
[10:59:28] <Duikb00t> This is what I tried which is obviously not working
[11:00:23] <Duikb00t> taplar: https://paste.ee/p/Ogg6a
[11:00:58] <taplar> no, you'll want to do something like $(this).hasClass('myclass')
[11:01:18] <Duikb00t> But they are dynamic?
[11:01:26] <Duikb00t> I want to load content into a div based ont he clickd class ;)
[11:01:42] <taplar> ok, so might i suggest a small markup change?
[11:01:49] <Duikb00t> Sure
[11:02:05] <taplar> <a href="#" class="..." data-image="1">
[11:02:14] <Duikb00t> data-image="1" = cross browser?
[11:02:18] <taplar> yep
[11:02:19] <Duikb00t> Was a bit worried about that.
[11:02:33] <Duikb00t> And does it have to be an image?
[11:02:35] <taplar> then just reference the data('image') to get the number
[11:02:39] <taplar> no, you can name it whatever
[11:02:42] <taplar> data-*
[11:03:10] <Duikb00t> data-user="1">
[11:03:12] <Duikb00t> using that now
[11:03:13] <NoiseEee> data-somethingThatHelpsMeIdentify
[11:03:19] <taplar> ^
[11:03:24] <Duikb00t> SweetDone.

[11:05:35] <Duikb00t> Now I have to add a click on the data-user
[11:05:40] <chalist> How i can set callback function for attr()? I set image data in img tag's src and I would like to do something after attr() function. can I do this?
[11:05:47] <taplar> no, you'd just add it to square or bg
[11:06:05] <taplar> (or another descriptive class)
[11:06:10] <Duikb00t> eeeehh
[11:09:08] <taplar> Duikb00t: https://jsfiddle.net/h8hrn46u/

[11:27:12] <BackEndCoder> hi
[11:27:21] <BackEndCoder> so i'm trying a 'lets learn js' week
[11:27:40] <BackEndCoder> where is the best place to start, as in debugging tools and good starting practices
[11:27:45] <BackEndCoder> (i'm a strong php developer)
[11:28:22] <NoiseEee> https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/ @ BackEndCoder
[11:28:29] <BackEndCoder> i'm mmid way thu a autocomplete json responce, but having issues malipulating the return array
[11:28:35] <NoiseEee> http://eloquentjavascript.net/ @ BackEndCoder
[11:28:41] <taplar> by learn js do you mean learn js or learn jquery?
[11:30:17] <BackEndCoder> getting to grips with vanilla js will help me take on jquery
[11:30:21] <BackEndCoder> without stuggle with the silly things
[11:30:30] <taplar> cool, just checking
[11:31:00] <BackEndCoder> i seem to be wasting time atm cause i don't know how to debugg it properly
[11:31:09] <BackEndCoder> i know about console, but its limiting
[11:31:25] <NoiseEee> BackEndCoder: check out that google developer link.  also http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 is a nice intro as well
[11:31:57] <BackEndCoder> thanks, the ebook looks good
[12:25:22] <arup_r> I wrote one code   $("ul.active-users").on("click", "a.remove-internal-user i.fa-minus", function() {}) as  $("ul.active-users").bind("click", "a.remove-internal-user i.fa-minus", function() {}) for some  reasons and it is not working. how to write it then ?
[12:26:28] <NoiseEee> .bind is old, .on is new
[12:26:42] <duch_kazatel> more like .bind is ancient, .on is old but preferred.
[12:26:46] <duch_kazatel> amiritte
[12:26:50] <NoiseEee> rite!
[12:27:07] <arup_r> NoiseEee: ok, I need to unbind and bind again.. so how to unbind the same syntax
[12:27:17] <duch_kazatel> ew don't juggle bindings.
[12:28:06] <arup_r> what do you mean ?
[12:28:34] <duch_kazatel> i don't have context so i'm not really being helpful :)
[12:28:45] <arup_r> ok
[12:29:07] <NoiseEee> https://jsfiddle.net/238sg5eo/ @ arup_r   (comma between selectors in the listener)
[12:29:42] <duch_kazatel> ^ boom.
[12:29:47] <arup_r> for some reason same inputs are getting binded more than one time, that is why before binding, I am first unbinding... and then bind.. which make sures it has only one time bind..
[12:29:51] <duch_kazatel> delegation is sexy.
[12:29:56] <taplar> lmao
[12:30:17] <duch_kazatel> fixes like 85% of all problems you have with events.
[12:31:14] <arup_r> NoiseEee: I don't need comma, the selector is correct what I have
[12:31:50] <NoiseEee> arup_r: you're wrong but whatever
[12:31:55] <arup_r> it just binds 2 times, and that is why it is doing its job inside the function 2 times whc=ich I don't want
[12:31:58] <NoiseEee> arup_r: also maybe try re-asking your question
[12:32:21] <NoiseEee> arup_r: because i don't understand what your issue is?
[12:32:32] <arup_r> NoiseEee: let me make a fiddle then
[12:32:36] <NoiseEee> what do you mean "binds 2 times"
[12:32:38] <kilo_bravo> ajpiano: nice job on the debugging tutorial.
[12:32:52] <arup_r> I will NoiseEee replicate it
[12:32:58] <NoiseEee> ok thanks arup_r
[12:33:27] <taplar> i sense a rare misconception about delegation
[12:33:37] <arc_> |:
[12:39:30] <arup_r> NoiseEee: here is the testcase, I wan it to add the html "Added" one time, but due to 3 times binded, it is adding 3 times.. https://jsfiddle.net/hardlearner/awf6L78d/
[12:39:46] <duch_kazatel> that's not how you do delegatuion.
[12:39:53] <duch_kazatel> for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) { don't do this.
[12:40:12] <duch_kazatel> the entire point of delegation is to avoid cases like this.
[12:40:22] <arup_r> duch_kazatel: this is a sample.. I don't have for loop.. I am showing the effet
[12:40:35] <duch_kazatel> you need to change how you're binding is what i'm saying.
[12:40:44] <duch_kazatel> the entire point of delegation is so you don't need to unbind and rebind.
[12:41:29] <arup_r> duch_kazatel: for some reasons my JS is getting binded more than once.. and I need to make sure it binds once..
[12:41:38] <duch_kazatel> then fix the multiple bindings.
[12:41:43] <duch_kazatel> instead of unbinding.
[12:41:56] <duch_kazatel> fix whatever is running your multiple bindings.
[12:42:08] <arup_r> you are going wrong path.. duch_kazatel it is not that easy, this file got side affects
[12:42:14] <arup_r> Needed work around..
[12:42:18] <duch_kazatel> don't work around.
[12:42:31] <arup_r> not possible atm!
[12:43:08] <duch_kazatel> unbinding will cause other issues - you'll need to store the handler in a variable that you can reference in all necessary scopes or use a namespaced listener.
[12:43:15] <duch_kazatel> so fix the underlying issue.
[12:43:23] <duch_kazatel> and quit binding multiple times :)
[12:43:54] <arup_r> duch_kazatel: that is how I did, my fiddle little wrong. The callback I have in a variable only
[12:44:16] <duch_kazatel> then if that var is available in all necessary scopes, you have your answer.
[12:45:01] <arup_r> this is what I have https://jsfiddle.net/hardlearner/awf6L78d/1/
[12:45:15] <duch_kazatel> that's not how you use delegatuion.
[12:45:26] <duch_kazatel> you're fundamentally misusing delegation in your file if that's the basic idea.,
[12:45:37] <duch_kazatel> so fix that.  otherwise, the docs can tell you what you need :)
[12:45:40] <duch_kazatel> NoiseEee++
[12:46:20] <arup_r> What is the way then I should do delegation.. point me some links
[12:46:41] <duch_kazatel> bind higher up and only run the binding once.
[12:47:09] <duch_kazatel> the entire reason you use delegation is so you don't need to re-bind.
[12:48:09] <arup_r> If I do that way, then if my function executed 2 times, binding will be only once ?
[12:48:16] <duch_kazatel> no.
[12:48:21] <duch_kazatel> don't put it in that function.t
[12:48:24] <duch_kazatel> that's your entire problem.
[12:48:28] <arup_r> yeah, that is where I stuck
[12:48:51] <arup_r> can you give me an example ?
[12:48:58] <duch_kazatel> uh.
[12:49:11] <duch_kazatel> without seeing your code, all i can tell you is "put your event binding outside of that function"
[12:49:48] <arup_r> ok. then ?
[12:49:57] <duch_kazatel> that's all there is to it.
[12:50:02] <duch_kazatel> now you're not running it multiple times.
[12:50:35] <NoiseEee> arup_r:  what he said
[12:50:43] <NoiseEee> arup_r: don't put the listener in a loop
[12:51:00] <NoiseEee> https://jsfiddle.net/awf6L78d/2/
[12:51:08] <duch_kazatel> even if your actual code doesn't have it in a loop, you're fundamentally not understanding delegation.
[12:51:59] <arup_r> I have an event called `change` which is in Rails turbolink. That event binds whatever u put inside it ... once page load and once if any Ajax call happened.. so this how my function are getting binded twice..
[12:52:16] <duch_kazatel> then move your code out of that.
[12:52:39] <arup_r> then nothing will happen.. it has to be inside it..
[12:52:43] <duch_kazatel> ...
[12:52:55] <duch_kazatel> which is why you change the parent element you're binding to.
[12:53:00] <arup_r> that Ajax call all over the app which checks user still active or not causing it. :/
[12:53:01] <taplar> anyone explained bubbling yet?
[12:53:36] <duch_kazatel> arup_r you understand that you're basically using delegation like normal even binding, right?
[12:53:43] <duch_kazatel> like, you're not reaping any of the benefits of using it.
[12:53:51] <duch_kazatel> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[12:53:51] <arup_r> NoiseEee: that for loop is an example or testcase :) that is what happening..
[12:54:14] <NoiseEee> arup_r: well read duch_kazatel's link there ^^ and good luck
[13:00:45] <arup_r> ^^ read it. I know it too.. anyway thanks.. My bad my problem I couldn't express.. I will fix it..
[13:01:38] <duch_kazatel> except you're misapplying it soooo
[13:05:05] <arup_r> duch_kazatel: I am not.. I had many typos in my example.. and you people stuck there  :p https://jsfiddle.net/hardlearner/awf6L78d/3/

[13:05:50] <NoiseEee> arup_r: you're still explicitly adding THREE handlers
[13:05:57] <NoiseEee> good luck!
[13:06:19] <arup_r> leave it.. still it has error in examples.. NoiseEee, yes I am very close to my good luck
[13:07:10] <arc_> there's no way anyone can tell the difference between errors you don't want them to pay attention to and errors you do want them to pay attention to
[13:07:21] <taplar> an error is an error
[13:07:47] <arc_> if you're making errors that you can fix yourself, you should fix them before asking, or people are going to mention them
[13:08:21] <arup_r> I couldn't give the sample in fiddle properly, that is my mistake... and I ended up to links which I know ver well.. :)
[13:08:43] <duch_kazatel> arup_r you're fundamentally misapplying a concept, so you don't know them.
[13:09:16] <duch_kazatel> you can try to disagree until you're blue in the face :)
[13:09:18] <arup_r> duch_kazatel: you are talking based on my example.. so I am not taking it lightly..
[13:09:29] <taplar> what else would he base it on?
[13:09:30] <arup_r> s/not/""
[13:09:31] <b-ot> Correction, <arup_r> duch_kazatel: you are talking based on my example.. so I am "" taking it lightly..
[13:10:00] <duch_kazatel> except your example illustrates that you're binding a delegated listener multiple times.
[13:10:10] <duch_kazatel> which is exactly the wrong way to use a delegated listener.
[13:10:15] <duch_kazatel> i don't know how else to phrase that.
[13:10:18] <arup_r> taplar: When I am saying, my example is not proper, not need to tell me .. I don't know how it works..
[13:10:28] <duch_kazatel> you'
[13:10:30] <taplar> don't know how what works?
[13:10:51] <arup_r> don't know how to spell your nick!!
[13:11:01] <arup_r> please stop now!
[13:11:15] <arup_r> waste of time, nothing else..
[13:11:21] <arup_r> I have fixed my issue..
[13:11:30] <taplar> oh, ok.  yay
[13:14:41] <duch_kazatel> helluva morning.
[13:15:52] <taplar> whole horse, water thing
[13:16:12] <arc_> i know this question may be based on some misconceptions, but
[13:16:42] <arc_> i am using .load() to replace the contents of a div with the contents of an html file. i tried precaching all of the possible html files it might load, but it seems to still be requesting the files each time to see if they've changed. how can i "load" from the precached files?
[13:17:23] <taplar> how are you precaching?
[13:17:38] <duch_kazatel> and the server might be causing your headaches.
[13:17:51] <duch_kazatel> also, sounds like you really should read in the markup to an object instead and read from there.
[13:18:08] <arc_> prefetching i guess i should say
[13:18:31] <taplar> still, related to what duch_kazatel said.  are you just trying to get them, are you storing them...?
[13:19:20] <arc_> i'm not sure what you mean by that. i'm just trying to frontload all of this data so it doesn't have to load when people actually click
[13:19:40] <duch_kazatel> right, so instead of just using ajax to load it, you load it and then store the result in an object.
[13:19:48] <duch_kazatel> and then read out of that object when you need it.
[13:19:49] <taplar> what i mean is, are you doing a get request and not doing anything with it, letting the browser cache it.  or are you storing the responses?
[13:20:02] <arc_> the former
[13:20:12] <duch_kazatel> yeah, don't rely on that ;)
[13:20:20] <taplar> btw, how many files are we talking?
[13:20:23] <arc_> i just have all the files listed in <link rel="prefetch"
[13:20:40] <arc_> 57
[13:20:50] <duch_kazatel> yeah, then store in an object.
[13:21:01] <taplar> mmm, i was going to possibly suggest templates but... :(
[13:21:51] <arc_> can i like ... name the indices of an array somehow
[13:22:01] <arc_> i would rather not have to refer to them by a numeric index
[13:22:07] <taplar> just use an object
[13:22:27] <arc_> one object for all of them?
[13:22:43] <taplar> var pageCollection = {};  pageCollection.home = '...';
[13:22:45] <taplar> etc
[13:22:51] <duch_kazatel> or use an array of objects with name/value pairs.
[13:22:54] <duch_kazatel> or something like that.
[13:23:05] <duch_kazatel> are you planning on accessing by name a lot?
[13:23:06] <arc_> duch_kazatel that's how i was thinking it would work
[13:23:21] <duch_kazatel> or are you going to be doing a lot of enumeration over the set?
[13:23:38] <arc_> basically, when someone clicks, i take the id of the anchor and load the html file with that filename
[13:23:45] <duch_kazatel> then use an object.
[13:23:52] <duch_kazatel> whose keys are the IDs.
[13:23:55] <taplar> pageCollection[anchorId]
[13:24:01] <duch_kazatel> ^
[13:24:12] <arc_> okay. could you possibly link me to a page that describes how that works
[13:24:12] <taplar> mmm
[13:24:17] <duch_kazatel> uh
[13:24:21] <duch_kazatel> where are you confused?
[13:24:43] <arc_> i don't really know what to ask. that's why i just want to read about it
[13:24:48] <taplar> are you familiar with object notation?
[13:24:51] <arc_> no i am not
[13:24:54] <duch_kazatel> ah.
[13:25:07] <duch_kazatel> so you know how you can do someObject.someProp ?
[13:25:12] <arc_> sure
[13:25:20] <duch_kazatel> you can also do someObject['someProp']
[13:25:37] <arc_> hmm, i see
[13:25:39] <duch_kazatel> which means you can ALSO do var foo = 'someProp'; someObject[foo];
[13:26:00] <arc_> where does the someObject name come from in that example
[13:26:12] <duch_kazatel> it's whatever you want.
[13:26:13] <duch_kazatel> you define that.
[13:26:18] <duch_kazatel> var someObject = {};
[13:26:34] <arc_> oh, right, i get what that meant now actually
[13:26:49] <arc_> all right, i'll see what i can do with this. thanks
[13:26:58] <taplar> 'pageByAnchorId' might be a nice name for it
[13:27:01] <duch_kazatel> let us know if you get stuck :)
[13:27:17] <arup_r> guys, sorry if I was rude.. :(
[13:27:23] <islalobo> We have a full page parallax front page with several panel sections. We want to add a button to our fixed footer that when the user clicks it, it will bring them to the next panel section. I was looking at scrollTop() and scrollTo() and wondering if anyone has any recommendations to get this done
[13:27:45] <arup_r> good night/evening/morning to all of you.. bye
[13:27:55] <taplar> take care
[13:30:50] <taplar> ok, i'll admit i'm an idiot
[13:30:58] <taplar> what's an html parallax?
[13:31:30] <duch_kazatel> taplar that thing where different parts of the page scroll at different speeds.
[13:32:17] <taplar> you mean the thing with the foreground over the background at different speeds that seems to have came about with the ipads?
[13:32:25] <arc_> lol
[13:32:29] <duch_kazatel> it's an old old effect.
[13:32:50] <arc_> as old as the universe :p
[13:33:00] <taplar> i associate it with ipads, :P  the whole our entire site is on one page
[13:33:21] <duch_kazatel> hah
[13:33:49] <arc_> parallax is the effect of something in the distance seeming to move slower than something nearby as your viewpoint moves past it
[13:35:05] <taplar> cool
[13:52:38] <deadevilboy> hi guys
[13:52:42] <deadevilboy> I have a question
[13:53:03] <deadevilboy> imagine you have a div and that div acts as a button
[13:53:16] <deadevilboy> then it shows a child div
[13:53:40] <deadevilboy> however, if it is a child div, mouseover won't work, why?
[13:53:49] <islalobo> How can I scroll to the next anchor item using a 'next' button?
[13:53:50] * duch_kazatel looks in his crystal ball.
[13:53:58] <deadevilboy> if it is not a child.. then i will work... but not as a child...
[13:53:59] <duch_kazatel> deadevilboy weird, i can't see your code.
[13:54:20] <duch_kazatel> islalobo get the offset of the next item and scroll the window to that.
[13:55:25] <deadevilboy_> sorry.. connection was out
[13:55:28] <deadevilboy_> I will post it
[13:55:31] <deadevilboy_> just a second
[13:59:43] <deadevilboy_> http://justpaste.it/qe4f
[14:00:49] <deadevilboy_> oh... I forget to say, #botao_acidentes is main div
[14:01:07] <deadevilboy_> '.botoes_submenu_acidentes' the child
[14:05:41] <taplar> define does not work.  doesn't work at all?  doesn't do what is intended?
[14:10:49] <user_corrupt> I have the following bit of AJAX submitting a form, and I am trying to make it respond only after the form is submitted (line 8): http://pastie.org/10686140 can someone help me figure out how to do that?
[14:11:21] <taplar> you want the ajax to respond after the form submit?
[14:11:57] <user_corrupt> taplar: yeah, I just want to send an alert
[14:12:14] <taplar> you realize a form submitting is going to reload your page
[14:13:17] <user_corrupt> taplar: well, it posts to a PHP script that submits the form... so the data is being submitted, but my page is not reloading
[14:13:31] <user_corrupt> sorry if I'm not being clear, I'm an amateur
[14:14:11] <NoiseEee> user_corrupt: there's nothing about reloading a page involved there, and why use AJAX to submit the form *and* reload?
[14:14:20] <NoiseEee> user_corrupt: either post the form traditionally or use XHR, not both
[14:14:44] <NoiseEee> user_corrupt: seems the code you have should fire that "alert" when the response from the server has come back a-ok
[14:14:59] * taplar hates his network today
[14:16:00] <taplar> user_corrupt:if you said something to reply to my last statement i missed it, :(
[14:22:13] <deadevilboy_> sh... strange behavior
[14:22:16] <deadevilboy_> look at this
[14:22:17] <deadevilboy_> https://jsfiddle.net/20t3cku3/2/
[14:22:49] <deadevilboy_> if you don't use onclick, the code works... if u use on click, then the menu will appear
[14:22:51] <deadevilboy_> why?
[14:23:58] <taplar> your fiddle has syntax errors
[14:24:07] <taplar> your script in the html part is not closed properly
[14:24:57] <deadevilboy_> no, the problem was the function
[14:25:02] <deadevilboy_> I forget to ()
[14:25:19] <taplar> uh, no.  your first part is not finished
[14:25:41] <taplar> regardless of other errors
[14:27:18] <deadevilboy_> I jus exclude that script
[14:27:22] <deadevilboy_> *just
[14:27:27] <deadevilboy_> forget about it
[14:27:44] <deadevilboy_> I will just make my point in my example.. give me just a few minuts
[14:28:27] <duch_kazatel> fwiw you're including jquery twice in that fiddle.
[14:29:54] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/snw09899/1/
[14:30:00] <duch_kazatel> i think you're looking for something like this.
[14:30:40] <deadevilboy_> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/20t3cku3/5/
[14:30:53] <deadevilboy_> why this code is working and not in my whole code?
[14:30:56] <duch_kazatel> you're loading jquery twice.
[14:31:24] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/20t3cku3/6/
[14:31:34] <duch_kazatel> so what's the issue?
[14:31:48] <deadevilboy_> I have the same code on the website I'm building, but in that case, the on mouseover is not working on the child menu
[14:31:57] <duch_kazatel> also, $(this).css('background', '#606060'); isn't what you want.  $(this).css('background-color', '#606060');
[14:32:02] <duch_kazatel> any console errors on your site?
[14:33:27] <deadevilboy_> duch_kazatel: just a second.. I will put a console log
[14:33:33] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:33:39] <duch_kazatel> i'm asking if you're getting errors.
[14:33:43] <duch_kazatel> on your site.
[14:33:50] <duch_kazatel> open console, refresh page - > see any errors?
[14:35:06] <deadevilboy_> lol
[14:35:10] <deadevilboy_> didn't need to see that
[14:35:17] <deadevilboy_> stupid idiot (me!!)
[14:35:18] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:35:26] <duch_kazatel> there you go then.
[14:35:26] <user_corrupt> taplar: submitting my form with this AJAX does not cause the page to reload, but I'm trying to figure out why my alert does not fire here: http://pastie.org/10686196
[14:35:32] <deadevilboy_> in my code function didn't have () too
[14:35:35] <deadevilboy_> lool
[14:36:02] <taplar> user_corrupt:lol, ok, so your submitting your form with ajax.  earlier it sounded like you were doing some ajax, AND submitting, :)
[14:36:08] <deadevilboy_> thks guys
[14:36:11] <deadevilboy_> and sorry
[14:36:14] <deadevilboy_> for my mistake
[14:36:22] <duch_kazatel> deadevilboy_ it's all good.
[14:36:33] <deadevilboy_> duch_kazatel: thks again
[14:36:45] <user_corrupt> taplar: yeah, my amateurness makes it kinda hard to be clear at all times
[14:36:46] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[14:37:00] <taplar> user_corrupt:have you checked your network tab?  what response code are you getting from that ajax call?
[14:37:52] <islalobo> So, I'm trying to get the offset of an element and scroll to that element. This is what my jquery is so far: http://kopy.io/qXw5M
[14:38:18] <islalobo> This will just scroll back and forth between the first and section section
[14:38:56] <duch_kazatel> .next() is very likely not what you want
[14:39:00] <duch_kazatel> since you have no context.
[14:39:13] <duch_kazatel> you probably need the parent() .hazmat and get the next one from there.
[14:39:31] <deadevilboy_> duch_kazatel: btw, in that example that I gave, menu was overflow.. how can I send it back?
[14:39:40] <duch_kazatel> deadevilboy_ huh?
[14:39:48] <deadevilboy_> I tried z-index, but that didn't seemed to work
[14:40:00] <duch_kazatel> what do you mean by "send it back?
[14:40:14] <deadevilboy_> well.. menu was in front of the "button"
[14:40:31] <deadevilboy_> I want it in a back plane
[14:40:36] <duch_kazatel> link?
[14:40:57] <deadevilboy_> https://jsfiddle.net/20t3cku3/7/
[14:41:16] <duch_kazatel> so you want the menu behind the button?
[14:41:35] <deadevilboy_> yes
[14:41:40] <duch_kazatel> can't really do that the way your markup is currently built.  hit up #css for ideas.
[14:42:05] <deadevilboy_> hmm... I see.. ok
[14:42:07] <deadevilboy_> thks
[14:42:25] <deadevilboy_> I used z-index but that didn't seem to work
[14:45:43] <arc_> okay, so i can't figure out how to actually get the html data into the object. i can't use .load() apparently
[14:45:53] <duch_kazatel> nope - you use .ajax() for that.
[14:46:02] <duch_kazatel> $.load() is just a convenience method.
[14:46:12] <arc_> i was hoping to avoid learning that forever, but i guess here we go ;)
[14:46:18] <taplar> lol
[14:46:19] <duch_kazatel> it's really simple.
[14:46:20] <islalobo> duch_kazatel: I want to scroll to the next sibling below, I'm not sure parent is what would help. But you're right about the issue being related to having no context
[14:46:32] <duch_kazatel> islalobo make a fiddle.
[14:46:52] <duch_kazatel> show me your markup and stuf.
[14:47:01] <arc_> lol, the settings parameters on the jquery.ajax page don't make it look that simple. but maybe the examples do
[14:47:27] <taplar> most are optional
[14:47:29] <duch_kazatel> arc_ you can probably just do $.ajax('someurl').done(function() {});
[14:47:45] <arc_> is .done required?
[14:47:51] <taplar> or $.get()
[14:48:14] <duch_kazatel> i prefer .done()
[14:48:24] <duch_kazatel> instead of success.
[14:48:27] <arc_> i thought .get() was about http post/get requests
[14:48:33] <duch_kazatel> .get() is an ajax method.
[14:48:39] <taplar> how do you think your getting the html?
[14:48:40] <duch_kazatel> which uses http.
[14:48:43] <duch_kazatel> ^
[14:49:05] <arc_> idk, i don't know http. those have always been associated with form submission in my mind
[14:49:14] <duch_kazatel> and everything else.
[14:49:17] <arc_> heh okay
[14:49:25] <duch_kazatel> fetching a page?  you're doing a get.
[14:49:34] <duch_kazatel> ajax supports all those http methods.
[14:51:02] <user_corrupt> taplar: when I load the page that has includes the script with this code, the browser is telling me that it gets a 304 with it
[14:51:35] <taplar> should be fine...
[14:52:19] <taplar> for shiggles, add an 'error' callback to it
[14:52:30] <taplar> similar to how you did your 'success'
[14:55:51] <NoiseEee> user_corrupt: but the actual ajax request itself, not loading the page
[14:56:59] <NitroLiq> Hi All
[14:57:09] <taplar> yo
[14:57:11] <NoiseEee> user_corrupt: the response you get from sending ajax to "vote.php"
[14:57:12] <NitroLiq> Need a bit of JSON advice
[14:57:43] <taplar> jason is cool
[14:58:26] <NitroLiq> I'm putting together a basic elections front-end where I'll be eventually pulling data from a json file.
[14:58:44] <NitroLiq> So I've put together a super basic example here: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/NxvWRw
[15:00:05] <NitroLiq> While easy to loop and output that string like I am. It seems a better approach would be to already define the td markup with classes and parse the JSON data into each td
[15:00:26] <taplar> sure
[15:00:34] <taplar> templates will let you do that
[15:00:56] <NitroLiq> Just nto sure how to separate things out like that
[15:01:22] <NitroLiq> This is going to end up being ported into Drupal so I just need to do basic front-end stuff
[15:01:34] <taplar> so without using any templating engine you can do some simple stuff
[15:01:39] <taplar> one sec
[15:01:45] <NitroLiq> Doing the json stuff more for my own knowledge
[15:02:56] <islalobo> duch_kazatel https://jsfiddle.net/8fqcwoaL/2/
[15:04:02] <islalobo> Hello, I'm trying to scroll to the next sibling section with a specific class. See fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/8fqcwoaL/2/
[15:06:39] <user_corrupt> taplar: the form is submitting to the DB via AJAX, but the error alert is coming back. Here is what my script looks like: http://pastie.org/10686258
[15:07:23] <taplar> NitroLiq: https://jsfiddle.net/ca1ytvuc/
[15:07:28] <islalobo> Updated: https://jsfiddle.net/8fqcwoaL/3/
[15:08:10] <user_corrupt> tapler: I'm not sure if this is significant, but chrome debugger is telling me that the request method for that script is GET
[15:08:12] <taplar> NitroLiq:heh, i'm appending first name both times, but you get the idea hopefully
[15:08:35] <NitroLiq> yeah, reading through it now
[15:08:51] <taplar> user_corrupt:so you got something going wrong.  question.  is the data being returned json?
[15:09:05] <arc_> i got it working taplar. thanks
[15:09:24] <arc_> looks like duch_kazatel is out at the moment
[15:12:20] <user_corrupt> taplar: Apparently not. As soon as I removed that line then the alert came back successful. Thanks.
[15:12:34] <taplar> :)
[15:13:07] <arc_> duch_kazatel i got it working, thanks again
[15:13:13] <duch_kazatel> awesome, man :)
[15:13:15] <duch_kazatel> glad to see.
[15:13:24] <NitroLiq> It works. Just feels weird having the template script in the markup
[15:13:35] <taplar> better the markup than your logic
[15:13:48] <taplar> a template is markup after all, :)
[15:14:06] <NitroLiq> yeah, I just though there would be another way but still keeping everything abstracted in the JS file
[15:15:00] <taplar> you 'could' put the templates in separate files.  the thing with that is you'd have to request them
[15:15:15] <taplar> so you'd be adding some latency with that, which if your ok with, would segregate your different site parts
[15:15:47] <taplar> and latency aside, if the template is reused on multiple pages you'd want it separate anyway
[15:16:28] <NitroLiq> Yeah, I think that's the way I've seen them done. I haven't had to do much work with templates aside from some brief intros to moustache and angular
[15:17:32] <NitroLiq> I'm trying to sort out the logic (for my own benefit, really). In the end I'll most likely be delivering static markup/css
[15:18:36] <NitroLiq> Just wanted to play around with json to see if I could parse, format and write the necessary logic to make something similar to this: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/pgwPRw
[15:18:40] <NitroLiq> dynamic
[15:19:40] <taplar> don't see why not
[15:20:20] <islalobo> duch_kazatel: https://jsfiddle.net/8fqcwoaL/3/
[15:20:55] <duch_kazatel> right.
[15:20:56] <islalobo> …and it doesn't work in chrome (well…it doesn't work period, but even less in chrome)
[15:20:59] <duch_kazatel> you need context of the next thinger.
[15:22:12] <duch_kazatel> i'd check to see if that fullpage plugin offers any sort of api to get the current panel.
[15:22:44] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#methods
[15:23:07] <duch_kazatel> specifically, https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#movesectiondown
[15:31:09] <islalobo> duch_kazatel++
[15:32:31] <duch_kazatel> hah, thanks.
[15:33:35] <arc_> so i'm thinking of taking this object i've created and putting it all into a data.js so i'm not loading 100+ html files, instead just making one request for one js file containing the data
[15:33:56] <duch_kazatel> arc_ it really depends on what all you're trying to accomplish.
[15:34:00] <arc_> i already have the object, but i can't seem to get the text of it. copying it from the console gives me truncated versions of each line
[15:34:10] <duch_kazatel> if that's what you want to do, then you want json of the data, not markup.
[15:34:13] <duch_kazatel> then use a templating engine.
[15:34:36] <arc_> it's not important enough to go that far
[15:34:43] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[15:34:48] <duch_kazatel> except you're halfway there :)
[15:34:57] <duch_kazatel> and you're concerned about the potential number of http requests.
[15:35:09] <arc_> i'm 99% of the way to just pasting this whole object into a js file and calling it done :p
[15:35:18] <arc_> as long as i can figure out how to copy it
[15:35:30] <duch_kazatel> (JSON.stringify)
[15:35:57] <arc_> thanks, i'll take a look
[16:25:22] <junicode> how can you tell jquery to record keys and input them on the p element?
[16:28:31] <NoiseEee> record keys?  input them on the p element? what does any of that mean?
[16:30:56] <junicode> NoiseEee: well i would like to just record a key for example
[16:31:03] <junicode> like if a user presses a key
[16:31:12] <junicode> i would like to know what it is for starters
[16:31:22] <NoiseEee> superb google-able question
[16:31:39] <junicode> i can't get the thing i googled to work
[16:31:46] <junicode> maybe you can teach me the main idea
[16:31:56] <taplar> cher
[16:31:59] <taplar> i mean share what you got
[16:32:06] <junicode>   $('body').keydown(     function(e) {         console.log(e.timeStamp);         console.log(e.keyCode);     }
[16:32:28] <wa5ted> junicode: in a fiddle please
[16:32:41] <junicode> can you tell me if that's right though?
[17:31:07] * taplar zzZZzzZZ
[17:46:19] <duch_kazatel> weeeeee
[17:49:07] <taplar> heh, every time it gets this quiet i occasionally check the logs to see like, did my connection to the room time out or something?
[17:49:18] <duch_kazatel> right?  i've done that a handful of tim,e.
[17:49:21] <duch_kazatel> *times
[17:49:21] <arc_> duch_kazatel i ended up just doing copy(objectname) in the console :p
[17:49:31] <duch_kazatel> arc_ that's one way to do it.
[17:51:45] <arc_> i didn't want to commit to doing too much more because this was a project i was doing for free for someone else
[17:51:54] <duch_kazatel> ew.
[17:52:25] <arc_> a community thing for a game i play
[17:52:51] <taplar> i have the urge to do something like that for one of my games.  but then i go home and.... there's other stuff to do
[17:53:08] <arc_> ;)
[18:08:09] <duch_kazatel> our local dev boxes are all kind of weird today.
[19:06:50] <IamTrying> http://i.imgur.com/6Ig260F.jpg - Bought this watch it has Android 4.4.2. How can i verify on this Watch if it has WebRTC compatibility?
[19:07:51] <duch_kazatel> IamTrying uhm.
[19:08:01] <duch_kazatel> IamTrying not sure that this is the right place to ask :)
[19:08:47] <IamTrying> duch_kazatel: there is a javascript code to do that. i forgot.
[19:09:01] <duch_kazatel> IamTrying then maybe ask in ##javascript :)
[19:10:40] <weborganization> how do you make an event handler that logs something to the console every time a particular button is clicked?
[19:10:49] <duch_kazatel> .on()
[19:10:51] <duch_kazatel> and console.log()
[19:10:57] <weborganization> what if it's not working?
[19:11:08] <weborganization> $(".button").on('click', function(){   console.log("IT WORKS"); });
[19:11:08] <IamTrying> duch_kazatel: this one https://test.webrtc.org/
[19:11:26] <duch_kazatel> IamTrying this isn't the right channel for that - go to ##javascript :)
[19:11:32] <duch_kazatel> weborganization any console errors?
[19:11:36] <weborganization> none
[19:11:51] <duch_kazatel> weborganization does that button take you to another page?
[19:11:55] <weborganization> no
[19:11:56] <duch_kazatel> or is it added after the page loads?
[19:12:09] <weborganization> what can we do
[19:12:19] <weborganization> to see what my code is supposed to be?
[19:12:23] <duch_kazatel> uh..
[19:12:31] <duch_kazatel> i don't know without asking some basic questions.
[19:12:37] <duch_kazatel> like is the button added after the page loads?
[19:12:42] <weborganization> i have no clue
[19:12:46] <duch_kazatel> huh?>
[19:12:50] <weborganization> it's an html button
[19:12:58] <duch_kazatel> it is added via javascript?
[19:12:59] <weborganization> the scripts are loaded at the bottom of the body
[19:13:03] <weborganization> yes
[19:13:13] <duch_kazatel> i'm guessing that's your problem.
[19:13:19] <duch_kazatel> you can't bind to things that don't exist.
[19:13:21] <weborganization> how do i fix it?
[19:13:30] <duch_kazatel> use event delegation.
[19:13:42] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[19:13:48] <duch_kazatel> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[19:31:35] <duch_kazatel> weborganization did those help?
