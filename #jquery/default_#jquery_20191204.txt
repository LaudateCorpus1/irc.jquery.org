[02:09:50] <IamTrying> robertmaxrees: While using Canvas where you have a picture. Is there no algorithm available for recognition of document A4 or small or random etc? (As example: Microsoft Lens recognition )
[02:14:55] <IamTrying> Instead of Color stuff, is there anything with Edge stuff? http://evanw.github.io/webgl-filter/ or http://camanjs.com/examples/ or https://evanw.github.io/glfx.js/demo/
[03:35:54] <IamTrying> Step 1: pip install numpy>=1.13 pyyaml>=3.12 matplotlib opencv-python>=3.2 setuptools Cython mock scipy; Step 2: how do i add jQuery to use the Mask R-CNN, RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN, RPN, Fast R-CNN, R-FCN algorithms in Canvas?
[03:36:36] <Cork> jquery can't run python...
[03:37:23] <Cork> well except you can possibly do something with emscripten, but not sure
[03:37:37] <IamTrying> Cork: https://ai.facebook.com/tools/detectron - i am trying this
[03:37:42] <IamTrying> OK
[11:03:04] <GrandMoffTarkin> hi I need to fire a click event on an element created via ajax request, in jquery you can do something like $('body #dropdown').click(), how would you do the same in native JS, so it works on a new element?
[11:07:25] <shoky> GrandMoffTarkin: that jquery code won't work on new elements..  to do delegation without jquery you need to just add the event handler to a parent element that already exists,  and in the handler check if event.target is the new element you're interested in
[11:08:25] <shoky> oh wait are you trying to trigger a fake click? if so my answer is irrelevant
[11:08:58] <shoky> but then i donno what you mean with "works on a new element", as triggering a click can only be done on an already existing element, obviously
[11:26:20] <GrandMoffTarkin> shoky, yeah triggering a fake click, but the elements are getting created dynamically on a react page, this is for a userscript to populate some information and auto fill a form
[11:26:47] <GrandMoffTarkin> but when I set the val of the dropdown it doesn't register, so trying to trigger a click
[11:27:03] <GrandMoffTarkin> the dropdown is autocreated based on a selected record
[11:43:45] <shoky> http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/#trigger_native
[11:44:20] <shoky> though you really shouldn't be doing that, especially not on a react page :S
[12:00:57] <GrandMoffTarkin> shoky: thanks
[14:25:00] <sydbarret> anybody awake?
[14:25:15] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:25:18] <sydbarret> can you tell me if this is jquery or javascript? fn.dataTable.ext.search.push
[14:25:31] <robertmaxrees> jquery is javascript soooo
[14:25:40] <sydbarret> robert https://bpaste.net/show/YVWXW
[14:25:45] <sydbarret> table doesnt want to filter
[14:25:58] <sydbarret> it prints min and max fine when i check it in console
[14:25:58] <robertmaxrees> you mean $.fn.dataTable.ext.search.push( ?
[14:26:26] <sydbarret> no just go through code
[14:26:36] <sydbarret> it seems table.draw is not working
[14:26:49] <robertmaxrees> without a working example i have no real way to help here :(
[14:26:50] <robertmaxrees> sorry bud.
[14:26:52] <sydbarret> i have the datatable with data but after I apply date filter wont show
[14:27:03] <robertmaxrees> i'd hit up the datatables forums tho.  they might be better able to help.
[14:27:18] <sydbarret> what do you mean a working sample ? jsfiddle?
[14:27:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah. a test case on jsfiddle would be a huge help.
[14:28:34] <sydbarret> ok give me 30 min
[14:28:45] <robertmaxrees> it'll take you that long?
[14:29:02] <sydbarret> the thing is im using flask to load html
[14:29:11] <sydbarret> how can i extract it and put it in jsfiddle
[14:29:16] <robertmaxrees> you can copy that markup out of your dev tools.
[14:29:38] <sydbarret> i dont get it
[14:29:59] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/x1N2drR.png
[14:30:46] <robertmaxrees> are you also loading html over ajax requests?
[14:31:05] <robertmaxrees> or do you just need what the page is outputting on load?
[15:14:35] <Guest35> hey, looking to use jQuery to wrap some text in a link wondering if anyone there can assist?
[15:14:42] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:15:08] <Guest35> I was thinking .append but not sure, this is the code I am trying to work with
[15:15:10] <Guest35> <div class="page-title-wrapper" id="yui">	<h1 class="page-title">Apply Now</h1></div>
[15:15:21] <robertmaxrees> try making a fiddle first :)
[15:15:23] <Guest35> I need to wrap the apply now text in a link
[15:15:32] <Guest35> whats a fiddle?
[15:15:42] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/
[15:16:55] <robertmaxrees> so you're starting with https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/os9qngk4/ for the html - what js have you tried?
[15:18:14] <Guest35> https://jsfiddle.net/z5sqceju/
[15:18:43] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jb6cmfa3/ w/ jquery included.
[15:18:47] <Guest35> the thing is I think I need to target the ID because this will only apply for one of these
[15:18:55] <robertmaxrees> so you wanna wrap the h1 in an <a>?
[15:19:22] <Guest35> basically, or the a in the h1 whatever is the proper way
[15:19:29] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[15:20:06] <robertmaxrees> just select the h1 and use .wrap()
[15:21:02] <Guest35> right. how can I target this specific h1 with the outside yui ID
[15:21:21] <robertmaxrees> do you know how you'd select it with CSS?
[15:21:44] <Guest35> $( "#yui h1" ).wrap( "<a></a>" );
[15:22:00] <robertmaxrees> :) you can also just do .wrap('<a>');
[15:22:03] <robertmaxrees> it closes it for you.
[15:22:47] <Guest35> oh neat. even if I need to have some attributes associated with the open a?
[15:23:08] <robertmaxrees> yep - .wrap('<a href="#">')
[15:23:10] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[15:23:12] <robertmaxrees> woorks fine.
[15:23:59] <Guest35> https://jsfiddle.net/gvfmr01x/
[15:24:13] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:24:20] <robertmaxrees> use single quotes for the outer quotes.
[15:24:35] <robertmaxrees> '<a href="www.google.com">'
[15:25:02] <Guest35> wow look at that
[15:25:16] <Guest35> thanks for the help!
[15:25:25] <robertmaxrees> def!
[15:44:05] <robertmaxrees> Guest35 don't PM me pls.
[15:44:07] <robertmaxrees> keep it in the channel :)
[15:44:22] <Guest35> mb
[15:44:42] <robertmaxrees> ask the channel - if somebody can help, they will :)
[15:46:14] <Guest35> I guess the path to the tag I was trying to update is probably a bit more convoluted real world and am concerned I'm not targeting the tag correctly. wondering if there is a good way to determine the exact css path for something
[15:46:34] <Guest35> I thought this was sufficient $('#yui_3_17_2_1_1575491984078_672 h1').wrap('<a href="https://google.com">'); but it isn't working
[15:46:40] <robertmaxrees> can you show a real-world example of the markup?>
[15:46:46] <robertmaxrees> and what do you mean "isn't working"?
[15:46:57] <Guest35> not wrapping h1 with link
[15:47:10] <Guest35> just search for that ID on the page hold on
[15:47:13] <robertmaxrees> what's generating the ID?
[15:48:56] <Guest35> https://bit.ly/2PbSfqw
[15:49:07] <Guest35> search for the Apply Now tag with inspector at bottom of page
[15:49:19] <Guest35> It's a Squarespace site
[15:49:45] <Guest35> template is no longer supported and I'm tasked with addressing some "minor" things that all involve workarounds at this time
[15:50:30] <Guest35> not clear why the wrap line isn't working but suspect the css path is not specific enough?
[15:50:35] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:51:02] <robertmaxrees> ID is literally as specific as you can get.  if it "wasn't specific enoguh", you'd be getting multiple h1 tags.  however...
[15:51:14] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting a different div ID.  but that's fine!  it sounds like you want to find the <h1> with the class page-title within the class page-title-wrapper, yeah?
[15:51:41] <Guest35> yes, but specific to that section.
[15:51:43] <Guest35> not every section
[15:51:53] <Guest35> those you id's are everywhere
[15:52:01] <Guest35> YUI not you
[15:52:03] <robertmaxrees> what do ytou mean "that section"?
[15:52:13] <robertmaxrees> is there another h1 with just the text "Apply Now"?
[15:52:30] <Guest35> no
[15:52:43] <robertmaxrees> so then your answer to my question is "yes" :)
[15:53:02] <robertmaxrees> i'll give you a freebie on this one and show you, but you want .filter()
[15:53:20] <Guest35> but if text changes then .filter wouldn't work correct?
[15:53:25] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[15:53:31] <robertmaxrees> you cannot rely on those IDs.
[15:53:33] <Guest35> what is wrong with wrap?
[15:53:38] <robertmaxrees> those are autogenerated/.
[15:53:46] <Guest35> explain?
[15:53:49] <robertmaxrees> you're still going to use wrap.
[15:53:53] <robertmaxrees> one sec let me show you.
[15:55:11] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/40ynbwLh/2/
[15:56:58] <robertmaxrees> so basically, you're getting all the .page-title elements under a .page-title-wrapper element, then filtering down to the onw you want based on the text/.
[15:57:17] <robertmaxrees> you can't just select on the ID because the ID is changing out from under you, making it unreliable.
[15:57:55] <Guest35> I'll give that a whirl. I'm not totally comfortable with such a specific solution because then the text can never change without updating the string but if the ID is also changing then I guess beggars can't be choosers or something like that
[15:58:07] <Guest35> I didn't pick out square space so...
[15:58:32] <robertmaxrees> heh, yeah... you don't really have much of a choice.
[15:59:42] <Guest35> welp, that gets the job done. gitter dun
[15:59:56] <Guest35> maybe in my free time I can come up with a better solution
[16:00:02] <Guest35> my "free time"
[16:00:19] <Guest35> appreciate the jQuery 101
[16:00:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it's called "don't use squarespace"
[16:00:31] <Guest35> hahah not getting into it
[16:00:38] <robertmaxrees> and sure!  check out learn.jquery.com some time.
[16:01:24] <Guest35> by the way, I'm just using kiwi irc you recommend any good IRC apps for Mac?
[16:01:33] <robertmaxrees> i don't use Mac :)
[16:01:38] <Guest35> lol
[16:01:52] <Guest35> well what do you use on windows maybe I'll fire up wine
[16:02:17] <robertmaxrees> a semi-configured copy of mIRC.
[16:02:25] <robertmaxrees> probably one of the last people using it.
[16:02:32] <shoky> lol, me too ;p
[16:02:40] <robertmaxrees> hah
[16:02:50] <shoky> v6.21
[16:03:06] <robertmaxrees> 7.58 here
[16:36:06] <viraltaco_> Hi
[16:36:16] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon.
[16:36:17] <viraltaco_> I can't get $(this) to ever work
[16:37:25] <robertmaxrees> lemme guess - you're using arrow functions
[16:37:37] <viraltaco_> OMG
[16:37:45] <viraltaco_> How did you know? :O
[16:37:50] <viraltaco_> https://pastebin.com/tLBf3ZTS
[16:37:56] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[16:38:03] <robertmaxrees> and that's why you use arrow functions.
[16:38:33] <viraltaco_> I use arrow functions for anonymous functions, right?
[16:38:45] <robertmaxrees> you can use normal functions for that.
[16:38:52] <viraltaco_> I mean that's how I've been using them
[16:38:57] <viraltaco_> Oh 😕
[16:39:21] <robertmaxrees> you can use arrow functions or regular functions.  arrow functions can't have their 'this' set like normal functions.
[16:39:23] <viraltaco_> How do I do it with anonymous functions? ._.
[16:39:46] <robertmaxrees> how do you think you would? :)
[16:39:51] <robertmaxrees> arrow functions can also be named fwiw.
[16:40:16] <viraltaco_> I wish there was a web version of swift
[16:40:28] <robertmaxrees> you could probably transpile into
[16:40:31] <robertmaxrees> *into JS.
[16:40:44] <viraltaco_> I can't, it's for an assignment
[16:41:13] <robertmaxrees> also: use semicolons.
[16:41:19] <viraltaco_> Why?
[16:41:34] <robertmaxrees> relying on ASI to fix omissions leads to bugs.
[16:41:54] <viraltaco_> Sounds like a bug in the language.
[16:42:01] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:42:05] <robertmaxrees> ASI has specific rules.
[16:42:33] <robertmaxrees> instead of leaving it up to the language to figure out where to insert semicolons, put them where they should be :)
[16:42:48] <robertmaxrees> also: what's $(this).term.val() trying to point at in your code?
[16:43:15] <viraltaco_> it's an input name='term'
[16:43:20] <viraltaco_> type text
[16:43:23] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you do that.
[16:43:33] <viraltaco_> D:
[16:43:47] <robertmaxrees> .term isn't a property of jquery objects.
[16:44:06] <robertmaxrees> give the input a classname and do $(this).find('.foo').val();
[16:44:57] <viraltaco_> it's not a class tho 😕 I don't understand any of this
[16:45:05] <robertmaxrees> an html class :)
[16:45:29] <viraltaco_> it's a name, the inputs don't have a class
[16:45:36] <robertmaxrees> can you add one?
[16:45:54] <viraltaco_> aren't the properties called attributes? or something
[16:46:06] <robertmaxrees> correct. they become properties in the DOM./
[16:46:08] <viraltaco_> No, I'm given the html file, I just need to make the jquery
[16:46:14] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with that I'm suggesting :)
[16:46:17] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[16:46:26] <robertmaxrees> so then you want to select on the name property.
[16:46:36] <robertmaxrees> or attribute.
[16:46:54] <viraltaco_> I'll try to figure it out. Part of my assignment is to look up the docs, you shouldn't have to explain it to me 😕
[16:47:16] <robertmaxrees> alrighty :)
[16:47:22] <robertmaxrees> also check out https://learn.jquery.com/
[16:47:31] <viraltaco_> thanks for the help tho. Not sure I would have ever figured out the this thing without you <3
[16:47:40] <robertmaxrees> sure
[17:32:37] <viraltaco_> How do I parse json with jQuery? prof said "you don't have to use JSON.parse()" I think… Didn't catch the rest. I might google it actually
[17:33:00] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't parse JSON.
[17:33:15] <robertmaxrees> well, not directly.  could you provide more context?
[17:33:38] <viraltaco_> oh, $.parseJSON()
[17:33:45] <viraltaco_> pretty similar imho
[17:33:45] <robertmaxrees> oh that.
[17:33:48] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[17:34:36] <robertmaxrees> so really your question was more "what can i use instead of JSON.parse()?" I take it?
[18:25:02] <Guest35> hey, does anyone know of any jQuery localization stuff? I have a static html site with some jQuery on it and am tasked to offer up a Turkish version without tapping into an api like google translate. wondering what my options here are
[18:25:14] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:25:29] <robertmaxrees> jquery is just a DOM manipulation library.  you'll want to search for an i18n library.
[18:26:00] <Guest35> what a mess. site just launched and this gets dumped on me
[18:26:02] <robertmaxrees> though that kind of task is much more involved than just dropping a script onto the page.
[18:26:18] <Guest35> I'm aware. believe me. scrambling here to wrap my head around it
[18:26:53] <Guest35> let me see whats up with i18n library
[18:27:05] <robertmaxrees> that's not "a library".
[18:27:13] <robertmaxrees> i18n just means "internationalization"
[18:27:40] <Guest35> oh
[19:21:34] <viraltaco_> Yay I did it!
[19:21:46] <robertmaxrees> :) cool
[19:22:06] <viraltaco_> https://git.io/JeD67 if anyone cares
[19:22:18] <viraltaco_> I even used semi colons ._.
[19:22:57] <robertmaxrees> how crazy you wanna get with those for for of loops? ;)
[19:23:10] <robertmaxrees> also: what version of jquery are you using?
[19:23:48] <viraltaco_> latest
[19:23:59] <viraltaco_> I like for loops
[19:24:10] <robertmaxrees> i'd look into using promises instead of those callbacks.
[19:24:37] <viraltaco_> Not a requirement for the class :| 
[19:25:02] <robertmaxrees> lol neither is for of but hey who's countine ;)
[19:25:04] <robertmaxrees> *counting
[19:25:56] <robertmaxrees> can replace the entire contents of that tableHeader function with return tr(listString.map(line => `<th scope="row">${line}</th>`).join(''));
[19:28:19] <viraltaco_> It passes the tests. But thank you for the feedback, I'll consider it
[19:28:26] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:32:13] <robertmaxrees> not saying your code doesn't work or that it isn't good, just that you could take it totally next level :)
