[00:02:20] <Jerrry> WhirledPress: Thanks. I just didn't know if they had a more clever way of doing it than the loop thing, which is what I found when googling.
[00:02:44] <WhirledPress> sorry, not sure what you mean by the loop thing?
[00:05:01] <WhirledPress> $() is is the jquery function that selects objects in the DOM. If you want to loop through all of them, there are several jquery methods like .each() $('.someclass').each(function () {}) loops though all of the elements whose class property contains .someclass and applies the function() to each item
[00:19:20] <Jerrry> WhirledPress: I was trying to change the width of all divs of a certain class with vanilla javascript, and surprisingly you have to do getElementsByClass to get an array of all the divs, and then create a loop to modify them all one by one.
[00:19:47] <WhirledPress> $(".class").width(30);
[00:20:02] <WhirledPress> selects them all and loops through them making them all have a width of 30
[00:20:08] <WhirledPress> px sorry
[00:20:15] <Jerrry> So I wonder if that's also how Jquery did it under the hood, in case I have a page that has like 1000 divs.
[00:20:28] <red^> use CSS
[00:20:34] <WhirledPress> lol
[00:20:50] <WhirledPress> Jerry, you can always look at the source code for Jquery
[00:21:08] <WhirledPress> and 1000 divs would not be a problem for jquery, btw
[00:21:29] <WhirledPress> but css would be better
[00:21:37] <Jerrry> Cool. I was trying to figure out how to do a certain thing and it couldn't be done with just pure css either.
[00:21:38] <systemfault> Array.prototype.slice.call(document.querySelectorAll('.class')).forEach(function(node) { node.style.width = '200px'; });
[00:22:06] <WhirledPress> <---the brains
[00:22:11] <systemfault> So yeah... jQuery makes it a bit nicer.
[00:22:27] <WhirledPress> sorry, that was supposed to point to systemfault, not back to me. LOL
[00:22:37] <Jerrry> Hahaha
[01:39:52] <distrtedpuppy> I’ve got an ajax call to php that replaces the contents of a div, but this breaks the event listener. I’ve searched stackoverflow and can’t seem to figure out how to fix this
[01:48:20] <Uhkis> you need delegation
[01:48:58] <distrtedpuppy> Uhkis, I have seen that on stack overflow, but it isn’t clicking
[01:53:34] <Uhkis> distrtedpuppy: make a fiddle
[01:54:34] <distrtedpuppy> http://jsbin.com/nuzetosofa/edit?html,js,output
[01:55:41] <distrtedpuppy> not going to work really, but you should at least get an idea of what I’m trying to do… I think
[01:59:10] <distrtedpuppy> I guess the fiddle is a little cleaner: https://jsfiddle.net/9xn0bsz3/3/
[02:00:04] <distrtedpuppy> getcart.php echos out a table and the same form (form id=“modal_viewcart”)
[02:01:07] <Uhkis> what's offer_target?
[02:02:08] <distrtedpuppy> offer_target is simply the div to replace content in
[02:05:26] <Uhkis> well it's plain undefined now, complete the fiddle
[02:06:38] <distrtedpuppy> huh?
[02:07:23] <Uhkis> it's an undefined variable, define it in the fiddle (= complete the fiddle)
[02:08:55] <distrtedpuppy> it is defined by the result of the php
[02:11:21] <distrtedpuppy> sort of impossible to complete the fiddle
[02:11:37] <Uhkis> pseudo it is!
[02:13:41] <Uhkis> distrtedpuppy: https://jsfiddle.net/9xn0bsz3/4/ like that
[02:13:49] <distrtedpuppy> I’m not very well versed in this — can we assume the php response returns the same html shown in the fiddle for <div id=“offer_target”> … </div> <!—end offer target-->
[02:16:13] <distrtedpuppy> so for insert static parent — #offer_modal_window
[02:16:51] <Uhkis> if that div is there on page load and stays there, yes
[02:17:03] <distrtedpuppy> yes
[02:17:52] <distrtedpuppy> well, sort of — that div is also populated by php, but event listeners don’t get attached until later
[02:18:56] <distrtedpuppy> wait, so that’s it?
[02:22:43] <distrtedpuppy> that was easy
[02:22:49] <distrtedpuppy> thanks uhkis — I get it now
[02:23:12] <Uhkis> :)
[02:29:54] <lulul> on the following code http://notey.it/n/dGQ3 it always says TypeError: prototype is undefined and prototype is connected to the var collectionHolder which get's a div loaded by that ajax response
[02:35:33] <Kartagis> lulul: I'm noy sure but you may have to do prototype = ... instead of var prototype = ...
[02:35:45] <Kartagis> *not
[02:38:06] <lulul> umm not really sure either the code works ok without that ajax call :D
[02:38:57] <lulul> the problem is that my collectionHolder is empty
[06:01:46] <Caz> Hello there

[08:30:35] <GeekMonkey> hey all
[08:30:49] <GeekMonkey> I am trying to prevent a function running on click
[08:31:13] <GeekMonkey> it works but not on first click
[08:31:17] <GeekMonkey> any help
[08:33:07] <GeekMonkey> https://kobra.io/#/e/-KNH_vFab1j5YBxasZ_3
[08:33:12] <GeekMonkey> That is the script
[08:38:39] <tom_____> GeekMonkey, it's hard to tell from that extract but it's most likely caused by the order the events are defined in
[08:39:24] <tom_____> The bind which uses the et_pb_smooth_scroll function will be defined before your .section-accordion-btn bin
[08:39:31] <tom_____> So it will run first
[08:39:38] <tom_____> So the function which disables it runs after
[08:39:44] <tom_____> which explains why it does not work on first click
[08:43:11] <GeekMonkey> tom_____ is there any way to adjust that
[08:45:50] <GeekMonkey> tom_____ the function is being called in the main WP theme (which I can not modify)
[08:48:36] <tom_____> GeekMonkey, I've never had to do it but google threw this at me: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2360655/jquery-event-handlers-always-execute-in-order-they-were-bound-any-way-around-t
[08:54:34] <CuriousMind> Hello
[09:05:02] <sayhi> hi
[09:05:05] <sayhi> im working with tabbed content and a sticky footer.. now im trying to reposition the footer after tab switch with: $(".tabs li a").bind("click", function () {reposition} - but the footer.position.top contains the position before i click not after i clicked.. any ideas?
[09:13:27] <mechanist> hello friends,
[09:13:56] <mechanist> I'm trying to make a combined php/jquery script in order to store the users data: http://pastebin.com/tCVbKw8a
[09:14:39] <mechanist> the data of the screen works good but I have problems with AND isset($_SESSION['document.write(window.jscd.os)'])
[09:14:45] <mechanist> is this not legit?
[09:15:22] <decx> it isnt
[09:17:16] <mechanist> how can I modify it?
[09:17:36] <mechanist> these two are legit isset($_SESSION['screen_width']) AND isset($_SESSION['screen_height']
[09:17:42] <mechanist> and work pretty good
[09:18:03] <sayhi> you cant execute js in php
[09:18:28] <mechanist> this works isset($_SESSION['screen_width']) AND isset($_SESSION['screen_height']
[09:18:40] <sayhi> yes
[09:19:02] <sayhi> because 'screen_width' is just a string.. and it seems to be set
[09:19:09] <sayhi> document.write is a js function
[09:21:31] <sayhi> and since php is executed on the server and js on the client.. this will never work
[09:24:02] <mechanist> ajax
[09:26:52] <sayhi> mechanist: ?
[09:27:48] <mechanist> as not said, sorry
[09:37:35] <mechanist> succeeded
[09:37:49] <mechanist> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18070154/get-operating-system-info-with-php
[09:38:10] <mechanist> sayhi this script perfectly works
[09:38:58] <sayhi> yes?
[09:41:24] <mechanist> yes!
[09:41:26] <mechanist> :-)
[09:41:32] <mechanist> try it
[09:41:56] <sayhi> .. i dont understand what youre trying to say mate..
[09:42:11] <sayhi> it works.. so?
[09:42:22] <mechanist> I need to store those data in a database of my website
[09:42:28] <mechanist> that's all
[09:42:53] <sayhi> then do it
[09:43:07] <mechanist> it will help me in marketing
[10:09:04] <sayhi> im working with tabbed content and a sticky footer.. now im trying to reposition the footer after tab switch with: $(".tabs li a").bind("click", function () {reposition} - but the footer.position.top contains the position before i click not after i clicked.. any ideas?
[10:10:23] <jerit> sayhi can you show your code on jsfiddle.net?
[10:10:30] <jerit> hard to say without an example to look at
[10:10:47] <jerit> my guess is that you're getting footer.position.top before it moves
[10:11:11] <sayhi> jerit - yes.. the .click event fires before the tab switches
[10:11:53] <sayhi> setting up an example would be quite time - consuming.. :S
[10:12:26] <jerit> so make switch the tabs and then execute the function that repositions the footer
[10:12:57] <jerit> MDL's tab components are awesome... easy to use and all this stuff is taken care of for your
[10:13:00] <jerit> -r
[10:13:29] <sayhi> im using zurb foundation tabs...
[10:13:45] <sayhi> but thanks - i think theres a callback on the tabs
[10:13:51] <sayhi> didnt think of that before
[10:35:18] <toothe> is there a way in Chrome to see what javascript is executed when you do something?
[10:35:24] <toothe> so, I want to see how facebook does something.
[10:35:27] <toothe> i want to see what function is executed.
[10:36:32] <taplar> you should set breakpoints and step through the logic, provided its not minified
[10:36:53] <toothe> it def is minified :(
[10:37:07] <toothe> but, when I press a character, some JS is run. I want to know what JS is run at that point.
[10:37:10] <taplar> you can still set breakpoints and such, but your probably not going ot get much out of it
[10:37:18] <Velveeta> and if you're not sure where to set a breakpoint, if there's some dom side effect, like you click a link and it changes something, you can set a dom breakpoint instead, and trace back through the call stack
[10:37:18] <toothe> perhaps not.
[10:40:18] <toothe> is there a way in general to figure out what function was just executed?
[10:41:45] <sayhi> toothe: firebug can
[10:43:08] <toothe> oh?
[10:47:21] <CuriousMind> I'm trying to get the red dot to move with the arrow keys. Can anyone help me please? https://jsfiddle.net/kabj3u2g/
[10:49:04] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/kabj3u2g/1/
[10:49:12] <taplar> seems like you have a couple of them working
[10:49:24] <CuriousMind> taplar: Oh hi we meet again!
[10:50:14] <CuriousMind> taplar: The red dot moves but why can't I move it up and around or diagonally
[10:51:00] <taplar> up and left would be the same action as down and right, just -= instead of +=
[10:52:02] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/kabj3u2g/2/
[10:52:11] <CuriousMind> taplar: Hmm ok I'll check that out
[10:53:21] <taplar> for diagonal you'll probably have to change up your logic from being a keydown check to being a keyup check
[10:54:34] <CuriousMind> taplar: I see what you did. I can use down and left but change it from positive and negative, it makes sense
[10:59:57] <MacroMan_> How can I operate on just a specific element that a selector returns and not all of them? I've tried this, but get a TypeError: $('.form-element')[1].val();
[11:00:11] <taplar> eq(1)
[11:00:34] <MacroMan_> taplar, Thanks. Works great
[11:00:48] <taplar> the issue is that [#] breaks the element out of the jquery object
[11:00:57] * MacroMan_ is reading up on eq()
[11:03:32] <CuriousMind> taplar: brb 10 minutes
[11:12:23] <CuriousMind> taplar: Hi back. So you said I will need top and left for diagonal right? Something like that?
[11:18:04] <taplar> you'll probably want to change on('keydown') to on('keyup') if you want to do diagonal
[11:18:22] <taplar> since you're going to want to check for multiple button presses
[11:19:02] <taplar> or i guess you could keep keydown if you put in a short delay
[11:21:39] <CuriousMind> taplar: Hmmm just thinking
[11:21:56] <CuriousMind> taplar: Do you mind showing me an example of diagonal movement?
[11:22:00] <CuriousMind> I'm like a visual learner
[11:22:08] <taplar> tinkering right now
[11:24:02] <CuriousMind> taplar: Ok no problem, thank you

[11:55:01] <jellium> Hello, I would like to have a horizontal scrolling when clicking on an anchor href link, on an element which uses CSS overflow-x property; I can't make good use of scrollLeft.
[11:59:25] <graphettion> taplar, I'm not getting any work done thanks to your fiddle
[11:59:32] * graphettion shakes first at taplar
[11:59:34] <graphettion> fist*
[11:59:39] <taplar> :D
[11:59:44] <graphettion> lol
[12:01:03] <taplar> for more fun put some text on the page and try to make it do the whole sing along bounce thing
[12:01:26] <CuriousMind> Hi taplar I just took a look at the code
[12:01:53] <CuriousMind> I didnt know you finished it, I was waiting this whole time lol it looks good, thank you so muxh taplar
[12:01:56] <CuriousMind> much*
[12:02:09] <taplar> you get what it is doing?
[12:02:23] <CuriousMind> taplar: Let me take a look at it
[12:03:42] <jellium> exit
[12:04:30] <CuriousMind> taplar: I have an idea
[12:06:08] <CuriousMind> taplar: So I like the code you produced but one thing. I don't like how when you move it diagonally it's weird. I don't know if you have time but I have some code which probably might help.  http://jsfiddle.net/bDMnX/7/
[12:06:31] <robertmaxrees> lol is taplar doing free work again?
[12:06:33] <CuriousMind> taplar: I didn't want to use this code because I don't understand it but I know it's useful and I do not want to plagerize this
[12:06:34] <graphettion> taplar, I put text in multiple spans and changed it to a class
[12:06:36] <graphettion> It's awesome
[12:06:42] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: We meet again
[12:06:47] * taplar loves animations
[12:06:57] <graphettion> robertmaxrees, no idea but I'm distracted because of him
[12:07:00] <CuriousMind> Im working on my first project for class
[12:07:40] <graphettion> So pretty - https://jsfiddle.net/graphettion/h7n181rj/3/
[12:08:43] <taplar> lol, crazy
[12:09:06] <graphettion> lol
[12:09:52] <robertmaxrees> neat
[12:10:05] <taplar> would have never thought to use stacking to make it do that effect
[12:10:10] <graphettion> I can be a drop down menu!
[12:10:32] <taplar> for some reason it makes me think of a slinkie
[12:10:47] <AwkwardCough> you can be whatever you want to be! So long as you dream it!
[12:10:59] <graphettion> ^ LOL
[12:11:31] <taplar> except for a fairy
[12:11:51] <taplar> little wings and pixie dust
[12:12:08] <taplar> sleep in a bird house
[12:12:18] <taplar> dunno why i'm telling you guys this....
[12:12:26] <graphettion> you can pet it
[12:12:28] <graphettion> and keep it
[12:12:30] <graphettion> and hug it
[12:12:30] <taplar> woah
[12:12:39] <taplar> heh, boundaries man
[12:20:29] <mechanist> hello
[12:20:34] <robertmaxrees> hello!
[12:20:34] <CuriousMind> hi mechanist
[12:20:42] <CuriousMind> I was suppose to say hi first >:(
[12:21:00] <mechanist> my script has some mistakes
[12:21:05] <mechanist> http://pastebin.com/kn0k1WTK
[12:21:28] <mechanist> it says  Call to undefined function getOS() in /home4/massimi6/public_html/testdata.php on line 23
[12:21:45] <robertmaxrees> mechanist that's PHP.
[12:21:46] <robertmaxrees> not js.
[12:22:13] <mechanist> look carefully, there's some javascript in here
[12:22:18] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:22:25] <robertmaxrees> there isn't.
[12:22:33] <robertmaxrees> i see a script take where you then try to run PHP.
[12:22:43] <robertmaxrees> what does that output do the actual page?
[12:22:55] <CuriousMind> Can someone please tell me what this code does? This is exactly the code I want, but I don't want to plagerize it and I have no idea what the hell it does?! Thank you http://jsfiddle.net/bDMnX/7/
[12:22:57] <CuriousMind> Please put comments please
[12:22:59] <mechanist> $os = getOS(); isn't this javascript?
[12:23:07] <robertmaxrees> mechanist i have no idea.
[12:23:14] <robertmaxrees> mechanist you're showing us trhe page before it goes to the browser.
[12:23:20] <robertmaxrees> show us what the browser gets.
[12:23:26] <robertmaxrees> CuriousMind erm
[12:23:26] <mechanist> getOS() is a javascript function
[12:23:27] <Uhkis> it is not, especially not in php closures
[12:23:35] <CuriousMind> hi robertmaxrees
[12:23:43] <mechanist> robertmaxrees: blank page
[12:23:51] <robertmaxrees> mechanist view source on it ;)
[12:23:59] <robertmaxrees> and there's no getOS js function.
[12:24:10] <mechanist> hmm
[12:24:12] <mechanist> wait a sec
[12:24:23] <robertmaxrees> CuriousMind sooo that's not really how we do that.  how about you step through it and you ask questions,.
[12:25:21] <mechanist> there you go, os.js: http://pastebin.com/e7wJf6Mn
[12:25:31] <robertmaxrees> mechanist that's not javascript.
[12:25:36] <robertmaxrees> that's PHP
[12:25:50] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: Hmmm ok fair enough
[12:26:19] <CuriousMind> going to take a break brb
[12:27:03] <mechanist> robertmaxrees: that "php" I linked last worked perfectly when I included it in the <script></script>
[12:27:13] <robertmaxrees> mechanist it's PHP.
[12:27:19] <robertmaxrees> that is not javascript code.
[12:27:21] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[12:27:22] <mechanist> since we have <script type="text/javascript" src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-git.js"></script>
[12:27:27] <mechanist> it's javascript
[12:27:29] <robertmaxrees> mechanist nope.
[12:29:04] <arc_> -_-;
[12:29:32] <robertmaxrees> mechanist here: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5veswmay/
[12:29:45] <robertmaxrees> even better: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5veswmay/1/
[12:29:53] <robertmaxrees> the first thing in that php file isn't valid JS.
[12:30:52] <robertmaxrees> foreach ($os_array as $regex => $value) { - there's no foreach keyword in js (shrug)
[12:31:23] <Uhkis> jquery, turning php into js since 2016
[12:31:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:36:20] <mechanist> robertmaxrees: you were right
[12:36:23] <mechanist> thank you and sorry
[12:36:30] <robertmaxrees> it's cool.
[12:36:49] <mechanist> I just added it again in the page
[12:37:04] <mechanist> in facts there is no <script> call
[12:37:11] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:37:22] <mechanist> here's where I took it
[12:37:23] <mechanist> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18070154/get-operating-system-info-with-php
[12:37:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so it's PHP :)

[12:41:34] <graphettion> haha
[12:41:37] <graphettion> shoky showed me that
[12:41:41] <robertmaxrees> good ol zombocom
[12:41:48] <graphettion> lol
[12:42:10] <mechanist> yes.
[12:44:04] <CuriousMind> back
[12:44:15] * taplar drops some eminem
[12:44:41] <CuriousMind> taplar: wat lmao
[12:45:03] <taplar> guess who's back?
[12:45:07] <CuriousMind> me
[12:45:10] <taplar> back again?
[12:45:29] <CuriousMind> I said me!
[12:45:30] <robertmaxrees> Yes.  He's back.  Tell some friends.
[12:45:37] <CuriousMind> You tell some friends
[12:45:41] <robertmaxrees> (it's a song)
[12:45:48] <CuriousMind> (yes I know)
[12:46:34] <CuriousMind> have you heard this song before
[12:46:38] <CuriousMind> im not afraaaid to take a steeeep
[12:46:59] <taplar> not ringing a bell
[12:47:20] <CuriousMind> we'll walk this road togetherrr
[12:47:24] <CuriousMind> throug the stooorrm
[12:47:28] <taplar> oh
[12:47:31] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:47:35] <CuriousMind> LOL
[12:47:35] <taplar> stand
[12:47:38] <taplar> not step
[12:47:41] <CuriousMind> whatever
[12:47:43] <CuriousMind> LOL
[12:58:15] <bonerx2k> what is the best way to parse a date for every browser?
[12:58:24] <robertmaxrees> moment.js
[12:58:24] <bonerx2k> i would think jQuery has a method
[12:58:28] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:58:36] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't do date manipulation really.
[12:58:40] <taplar> if it's already in ISO format you could use new Date(string)
[12:58:49] <robertmaxrees> or that.
[12:58:49] <bonerx2k> i thought that failed on FF
[12:58:53] <taplar> oh?
[12:58:58] <robertmaxrees> needs to be proper ISO format.
[13:00:16] <taplar> or better yet if you can return it in milliseconds, you don't have to worry about that
[13:08:35] <bonerx2k> if i am using moment.js and using 2014-01-01 00:00:00 format, do i need locales?
[13:08:36] <taplar> i told my friend that i was talking to a blonde about competing in a 5K and she kept asking me "5 wha?"
[13:08:52] <taplar> he said he didn't get it, so i said it was fine, it was a running joke
[13:09:24] <taplar> layers!
[13:09:30] <taplar> locales, eh?
[13:11:15] <taplar> my assumption would be moment defaults to utc unless otherwise specified
[13:14:13] <graphettion> shady's back
[13:14:17] <graphettion> tell a friend
[13:14:40] <taplar> i've created a monster!
[13:14:50] <graphettion> lol
[13:15:55] <frankenstein> don't scare me.  i might bolt
[13:15:58] <frankenstein> ha ha ha
[13:16:18] <taplar> weird friday
[13:16:25] <graphettion> mhm
[13:17:25] <graphettion> prolly a full moon tonight
[13:17:38] <robertmaxrees> nah that was a few days ago.
[13:17:51] <taplar> i am slow though
[13:18:25] <graphettion> that's why we use JavaScript :P
[13:18:58] <taplar> to combat moons?
[13:19:12] <FalsAlarm> i don't get really get something about javascript
[13:19:27] <FalsAlarm> facebook likes it that's why they created the javascript facebook sdk
[13:19:34] <FalsAlarm> i'm using it right now
[13:19:36] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:19:56] <FalsAlarm> How to i get all this javascript data to my db?
[13:20:03] <robertmaxrees> they created the SDK because you couldn't really create a client side SDK in any other language.
[13:20:05] <robertmaxrees> and what data?
[13:20:20] <FalsAlarm> do i make a php script and do a ajax request to it passing along the data from javascript to php?
[13:20:37] <robertmaxrees> FalsAlarm that's one way.
[13:20:45] <FalsAlarm> is that a good way?
[13:20:48] <FalsAlarm> also,
[13:20:59] <robertmaxrees> i dunno - what data are you saving?
[13:21:01] <FalsAlarm> the data i'm passing is the id, first_name,last_name, etc
[13:21:07] <FalsAlarm> and email
[13:21:07] <taplar> php can make web requests, and parse json
[13:21:09] <robertmaxrees> so everything?
[13:21:12] <FalsAlarm> yup
[13:21:13] <taplar> so you may can do it all on the backend
[13:21:15] <robertmaxrees> afaik, you shouldn't store it all.
[13:21:22] <FalsAlarm> taplar, how?
[13:21:22] <robertmaxrees> unless you have a really good reason to.
[13:21:36] <taplar> you'd have to look into the web request part
[13:21:50] <taplar> more of a ##php question
[13:21:59] <taplar> but i've done it in the past so it's viable
[13:22:14] <taplar> *i can say
[13:23:05] <taplar> i had a webscraper script once on a cron job, :D
[13:23:37] <graphettion> called the cleaning crew
[13:23:53] <taplar> the statistics stealer!
[13:23:57] <taplar> or whatever
[13:24:01] <graphettion> lol
[13:28:32] <taplar> i should tinker around with a php bot again so we can have b-ot back
[13:28:59] <taplar> !g jQuery
[13:29:03] <taplar> :(
[13:29:09] <graphettion> baby come back
[13:37:56] <cwolter> hi
[13:38:15] <graphettion> o\
[13:38:17] <cwolter> in javascript and jquery - does a digit alway refer to a number?
[13:38:26] <robertmaxrees> that's a loaded question.
[13:38:27] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:38:35] <robertmaxrees> numbers can be strings.
[13:38:36] <graphettion> some up some samples
[13:38:41] <robertmaxrees> or array indices.
[13:38:45] <cwolter> i'm learning regular expressions
[13:39:02] <cwolter> \d
[13:39:05] <cwolter> for example
[13:39:14] <cwolter> matches any single digit
[13:39:17] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:39:19] <cwolter> but is it limited to numbers
[13:39:22] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:39:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:39:27] <robertmaxrees> as opposed to...?
[13:39:38] <taplar> a number is composed of digits
[13:39:39] <cwolter> or do letters qualify as single digits
[13:39:44] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[13:39:48] <robertmaxrees> digit means number.
[13:39:48] <taplar> 0-9 are digits...
[13:39:54] <cwolter> ok
[13:40:12] <cwolter> so \d in a regular expression refers to a number 0-9
[13:40:17] <robertmaxrees> a digit, yes.
[13:40:33] <robertmaxrees> "any of the numerals from 0 to 9, especially when forming part of a number"
[13:40:36] <robertmaxrees> that's what digit means.
[13:40:37] <taplar> \d == [0-9]
[13:40:39] <cwolter> any suggestions or tips to help with regular expressions
[13:40:49] <robertmaxrees> sure - avoid them as much as you can :)
[13:40:52] <taplar> :D
[13:40:55] <cwolter> wish i could
[13:41:05] <robertmaxrees> more often than not, you can avoid them.
[13:41:08] <graphettion> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6479423/does-d-in-regex-mean-a-digit
[13:41:10] <cwolter> i'm a network and hardware guy
[13:41:10] <graphettion> :P
[13:41:20] <robertmaxrees> people use them for structured data all the time - terrible application for them really.
[13:41:22] <cwolter> learning some programming to aid with server and network integration
[13:41:32] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: Hi I am back
[13:41:43] <robertmaxrees> also: regex engines are all different.
[13:41:45] <robertmaxrees> hi CuriousMind
[13:41:50] * graphettion hide robertmaxtrees
[13:41:50] <taplar> graphettion: ah, interesting
[13:41:58] <taplar> i only think of english, ^_^
[13:41:58] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: Hi so you said to ask questions about http://jsfiddle.net/bDMnX/7/ I got questins
[13:42:08] <robertmaxrees> then ask away :)
[13:42:24] <graphettion> taplar, but that's pretty much right :)
[13:42:27] <CuriousMind> I know what variables pane and box is. What are the other variables? robertmaxrees
[13:42:37] <CuriousMind>     w = pane.width() - box.width(),     d = {},     x = 3;
[13:42:37] <robertmaxrees> could you be more specific?
[13:42:43] <graphettion> like he'll be using arabic numbers.
[13:42:44] <robertmaxrees> what do you think those are?
[13:42:47] <taplar> and example of why variable names should be explicit
[13:42:49] <taplar> *an
[13:42:59] <CuriousMind> In fact sorry let me re-word my question
[13:43:05] <CuriousMind> What would be the purpose of     w = pane.width() - box.width(),     d = {},     x = 3;
[13:43:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:43:16] <robertmaxrees> take a guess :)
[13:43:17] <CuriousMind> :D
[13:43:21] <CuriousMind> aw shit ok so
[13:43:26] <robertmaxrees> look at their values.
[13:43:31] <CuriousMind> d is a hash, I guess it's to store something
[13:43:39] <taplar> object
[13:43:43] <CuriousMind> x is a Number integer, idk the purpose and
[13:43:53] <robertmaxrees> ^ js doesn't have "hashes"
[13:43:58] <CuriousMind> pane.width means the width of pane minus the width of box?
[13:44:05] <robertmaxrees> and all numbers are numbers.  ints, floats, etc.
[13:44:07] <robertmaxrees> all numbers.
[13:44:14] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: Ahhhh ok
[13:44:37] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, you're right about w.
[13:44:41] <robertmaxrees> w = pane.width() - box.width(),
[13:44:42] <CuriousMind> But why did this author declare these variables
[13:44:47] <CuriousMind> whats the purpose and yes robertmaxrees
[13:44:48] <robertmaxrees> look at the code.
[13:44:50] <robertmaxrees> it tells you why.
[13:44:55] <CuriousMind> OK I will
[13:44:58] <taplar> poorly
[13:45:01] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:45:06] <robertmaxrees> this code is formatted really poorly.
[13:45:18] <taplar> take this as a note of what not to do
[13:45:37] <taplar> there is very little benefit to not naming your variables in a manner that is readable
[13:45:43] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[13:45:47] <CuriousMind> After the variables are declared there's a function
[13:46:10] <CuriousMind> semantics I think it's called
[13:46:10] <graphettion> robertmaxrees just went carrot crazy
[13:46:37] <robertmaxrees> it's just a function.
[13:46:50] <CuriousMind> what does it do, what's the purpose
[13:46:59] <robertmaxrees> ok so
[13:46:59] <CuriousMind> It takes in three arguments
[13:47:03] <robertmaxrees> asking that means you won't learn.
[13:47:07] <robertmaxrees> pull it apart.
[13:47:14] <taplar> also look to see where it is used
[13:47:15] <robertmaxrees> look at the operations.
[13:47:16] <CuriousMind> ok Ill break it down like a big boy
[13:47:17] <taplar> gives context
[13:47:21] <robertmaxrees> context is key
[13:47:25] <robertmaxrees> especially with garbage variable names.
[13:47:27] <zzing> What would be the effect of loading three different versions of jquery in the normal script tags and only calling jQuery.noConflict(); after the last one? (this is code I am going through, not my own)
[13:47:38] <taplar> zzing pointless
[13:47:52] <robertmaxrees> not entirely.
[13:48:01] <robertmaxrees> zzing the second would stomp over the first, the third would return $ back to whoever had it last.
[13:48:03] <taplar> no?  wouldn't the first two be wiped out?
[13:48:06] <CuriousMind> parseInt means to turn a string number into a number number
[13:48:07] <robertmaxrees> *before the last one.
[13:48:16] <taplar> ah
[13:48:46] <CuriousMind> huh
[13:48:57] <taplar> CuriousMind: yes, that's what parseInt is
[13:49:08] <CuriousMind> ok ty I shall continue
[13:49:19] <robertmaxrees> no need to call it a "number number" - parseint converts a string to a number :)
[13:49:35] <zzing> robertmaxrees: Not sure what you mean  return $ back against what taplar said about the first two being wiped out
[13:49:45] <taplar> i mispoke
[13:50:01] <taplar> jQuery keeps a reference to what $ was before it initializes
[13:50:10] <taplar> so it can do the whole noConflict thing
[13:50:52] <robertmaxrees> zzing yeah so basically, the first one loads and runs.  the second one loads and runs, stomping over the first one.  the third one loads and runs and stomps over the second, but then the noConflict returns $ back to the second copy.
[13:51:12] <robertmaxrees> if it's something like $jq = $.noConflict(), then you have that third one stored in $jq
[13:51:43] <taplar> and you could do it again to $jq2 if you wanted and have all three, heh
[13:51:52] <zzing> Its specifically jquery.noConflict()
[13:51:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah, either/or.
[13:51:59] <robertmaxrees> doesn't really matter.
[13:52:02] <zzing> The comment above it says //$ is reserved for Prototype
[13:52:05] <robertmaxrees> ah
[13:52:09] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:52:09] <CuriousMind> wtf is v
[13:52:14] <zzing> This is old code :-)
[13:52:29] <taplar> CuriousMind: look at where the function is used to try to figure it out
[13:52:46] <CuriousMind> taplar: alright alright
[13:52:59] <z1haze_work> is this legit? $('body').off('click', 'button.back');
[13:53:03] <z1haze_work> or how would I go about this
[13:53:04] <taplar> you can even console.log(v) to see the value
[13:53:17] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work go about what?
[13:54:08] <z1haze_work> I created and destroy a dialog and when i open it, i create bindings to elements, but if a person opens and closes and reopens, the events seem to bind twice
[13:54:14] <z1haze_work> i figured if i unbind them on close it would fix that
[13:54:19] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[13:54:21] <WhirledPress> hey all, when adding an element like var el=$("<div class='outer'><ul class='inner'></ul></div>"); when you .append elements to it will it be appended to inner or outer classs?
[13:54:23] <robertmaxrees> use a single delegated listener instead.
[13:54:35] <taplar> append goes inside the top element
[13:54:35] <z1haze_work> on page load?
[13:54:43] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work sure.
[13:54:45] <z1haze_work> ok
[13:54:54] <WhirledPress> taplar, thanks.
[13:55:09] <robertmaxrees> but don't add bindings inside of other bindings
[13:55:12] <taplar> if you want it in the inner you'll have to find('.inner') first
[13:56:08] <zzing> I just did a jQuery.fn.jquery and it appears to say the first one loaded instead of the second or third.
[13:56:19] <CuriousMind> v is a parameter for one of the functions and it's never initalized
[13:56:28] <CuriousMind> can someone please help me with this?
[13:56:30] <robertmaxrees> zzing then something else is reserving it.
[13:56:33] <robertmaxrees> CuriousMind we are.
[13:56:38] <robertmaxrees> we're answering questions.
[13:56:41] <robertmaxrees> what else are you expecting?
[13:56:56] <robertmaxrees> and newv IS being used fwiw.
[13:57:03] <CuriousMind> fwiw?
[13:57:05] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees:
[13:57:08] <robertmaxrees> for what it's worth
[13:57:10] <zzing> robertmaxrees: thank you and taplar for help :-). This is a convoluted webforms app, so it would be hard to really figure it out.
[13:57:22] <robertmaxrees> zzing oh gross
[13:57:45] <zzing> Would it be generally correct to say (subject to testing) that any jquery 1.x can be upgraded to the latest 1.x?
[13:57:54] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:58:01] <cwolter> a phone number without area code basically
[13:58:06] <robertmaxrees> not as a drop-in at least.
[13:58:16] <robertmaxrees> zzing methods and things get removed/changed.
[13:58:24] <robertmaxrees> so it depends on how far back you go.
[13:58:30] <zzing> 1.6 seems to be it
[13:58:38] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad sign heh
[13:58:47] <cwolter> "/(?:\d{3}|\(\d{3}\))([-\/\.])\d{3}\1\d{4}/" sorry didn't look like my expression posted
[13:58:48] <robertmaxrees> 1.9 was a big one that dropped a lot of things.
[13:58:55] <cwolter> am i reading it right?
[13:59:13] <zzing> 1.9.1 is the one that is the latest one
[13:59:24] <zzing> I guess I am just going to have to go through the code to see what is being used.
[13:59:26] <cwolter> i understand the 3 digits followed by - / or . and then 4 digits
[13:59:46] <robertmaxrees> cwolter i'd look for context and where that's being used to confirm intent.
[13:59:58] <cwolter> assignment
[14:00:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:00:09] <cwolter> i have to create an expression that matches the pattern
[14:00:24] <cwolter> so i'm trying to decipher what the pattern means
[14:00:34] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:00:37] <cwolter> i see passive group and 3 digits or 3 digits...
[14:00:43] <robertmaxrees> so they want you to create a regex for "/(?:\d{3}|\(\d{3}\))([-\/\.])\d{3}\1\d{4}/" ?
[14:00:48] <cwolter> yes
[14:00:53] <robertmaxrees> erm
[14:00:53] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:01:12] <robertmaxrees> that looks like a regex for me lol
[14:01:14] <robertmaxrees> *to
[14:01:45] <cwolter> ?: refers to passive group \d{3} means 3 digits | means or and \d{3} means non-passive 3 digits?
[14:01:45] <b-ot> the elvis operator
[14:02:20] <cwolter> [-\/\,] means either seperator - / or .?
[14:02:21] <z1haze_work> thanks robertmaxrees: seems to work like i want binding on page load .. i just didnt think it was a good idea to have all these binded events if they may/may not get used
[14:02:25] <cwolter> like a phone number
[14:02:44] <robertmaxrees> cwolter i'm way lost about why they're giving you a regex to then make a regex.
[14:03:00] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work for a lot of things, a delegated binding is fine.
[14:03:11] <cwolter> instructions from the assignment: Complete the table with a string in column 2 that matches the regular expression pattern in column 1 and a string in column 3 that does NOT match the regular expression pattern in column 3.
[14:03:35] <cwolter> this course has been crazy
[14:03:46] <robertmaxrees> to create a regex that does the same thing as the one you're provided?
[14:03:55] <taplar> i guess a more simple one
[14:03:59] <cwolter> i've taken html, css, c++ and now javascript and this course is the most difficult and least guided course
[14:04:19] <cwolter> to create a string that the regex may refer to
[14:04:31] <taplar> oh
[14:04:32] <cwolter> and then to create a string that the regex cannot refer to
[14:05:08] <robertmaxrees> that's really weird.
[14:05:29] <cwolter> yea, the last question i asked the teacher, took two weeks for a response
[14:05:44] <cwolter> 8 week course...
[14:05:53] <cwolter> 1 week left
[14:05:55] <graphettion> cwolter, is it a university?
[14:06:03] <cwolter> community college online course
[14:06:18] <cwolter> teacher off campus for summer
[14:06:35] <graphettion> even more weird (about not getting a response back) :P
[14:06:41] <cwolter> i know
[14:06:42] <graphettion> ah
[14:06:56] <cwolter> modules and text start above my head as it is
[14:06:58] <cwolter> i can code
[14:07:07] <taplar> i don't even know what \1 is...
[14:07:09] <cwolter> been doing it here and there for 10 years
[14:07:24] <cwolter> i know the \ is an escape character
[14:07:32] <cwolter> but i don't understand how it works in the pattern
[14:07:35] <taplar> 1 isn't a special character though, lol
[14:07:40] <cwolter> no it isn't
[14:07:43] <robertmaxrees> could be trying to throw you off.
[14:07:49] <cwolter> so is the 1 just there between the 3 digits and 4 digits
[14:08:11] <cwolter> 123 1 4567
[14:08:26] <robertmaxrees> looks like this accepts a country code maybe?
[14:08:52] <graphettion> read between the lines
[14:09:14] <cwolter> you mean between the \
[14:09:34] <cwolter> escape character does what in the expression?
[14:09:48] <taplar> escapes the next special character
[14:10:12] <taplar> \\ is a literal \
[14:10:21] <taplar> \\d would be literally \d
[14:10:30] <taplar> not a digit interpretation
[14:10:36] <cwolter> ok
[14:10:43] <graphettion> I just play with this http://regexr.com/
[14:10:50] <cwolter> so i have a 3 digit number followed by /d
[14:11:57] <taplar> . /(?:\d\d\d|\(\d\d\d\))([-\/\.])\d\d\d\1\d\d\d\d/
[14:12:40] <cwolter> i understand your expansion
[14:13:49] <cwolter> i just don't understand the literal after the | or what the passive group means
[14:13:59] <taplar> | means or
[14:14:05] <cwolter> i realize that much
[14:14:11] <cwolter> the the \ after the or
[14:14:22] <taplar> \( ?
[14:14:32] <taplar> it's escaping the (
[14:14:33] <cwolter> as you stated earlier would mean literal (\d\d\d)
[14:14:42] <cwolter> ok
[14:15:10] <cwolter> so the parenthesi doesn't matter in the string this represents
[14:15:27] <taplar> any where there is a \( that's a literal (
[14:16:10] <cwolter> ?:\d\d\d|\(\d\d\d\) means 123 or 321?
[14:17:35] <cwolter> 800-5678734 would match the expression?
[14:17:40] <cwolter> except there's the \1
[14:18:01] <danziig> Hello all!
[14:18:14] <cwolter> hello

[14:18:30] <CuriousMind> http://jsfiddle.net/bDMnX/7/  var w is the amount of space that the div can move so that it doesnt go outside the container?
[14:18:31] <cwolter> me too, but these guys are great
[14:18:52] <Velveeta> danziig: just throw a question over the wall and one of us may be able to catch it
[14:20:09] <danziig> http://pastebin.com/zCnMUA4W - Can someone tell me why my .grouptotal isn't doing anything?  I have two inputs, `.quantity` and `.systemprice` .  I need `.grouptotal` to be the product of those values
[14:20:14] <robertmaxrees> CuriousMind it's the width of the outer box minu the width of the inner box.
[14:20:35] <robertmaxrees> danziig $(this).val() returns a string
[14:20:53] <robertmaxrees> you need to parseInt or parseFloat based on what values you're expecting.
[14:20:55] <CuriousMind> robertmaxrees: What's the purpose of doing that?
[14:21:02] <Velveeta> also, at first glance, i would say 'input' is the wrong event name, you probably want 'change'
[14:21:21] <danziig> I've tried change as well with no success
[14:21:32] <robertmaxrees> danziig then make a jsfiddle real quick.
[14:21:39] <danziig> Ok one sec
[14:21:58] <Velveeta> (y)
[14:22:20] <robertmaxrees> CuriousMind try renaming the vars :) http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bDMnX/1285/
[14:22:36] <robertmaxrees> looks like yes, it's trying to prevent you from going outside of the pane
[14:23:26] <Velveeta> danziig: the only other thing i can think of to recommend immediately would be to wrap those lines in a document.ready wrapper
[14:24:06] <danziig> so I have it in window.onload = function() { js and jquery stuff }   that should work?
[14:24:11] <danziig> setting up jsfiddle
[14:24:34] <taplar> $(function(){ /* ur code */ });
[14:24:40] <robertmaxrees> avoid window onload fwiw.  use a doc ready.
[14:24:45] <robertmaxrees> but that shouldn't matter in this case.

[14:28:36] <danziig> ok
[14:28:39] <danziig> https://jsfiddle.net/waynebunch/L45z6z8c/1/
[14:29:08] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L45z6z8c/2/
[14:29:12] <robertmaxrees> you were missing juqery.
[14:29:20] <robertmaxrees> and no need for the window onload in fiddles.
[14:29:45] <danziig> ah
[14:29:56] <Velveeta> also, your dom structure doesn't quite match the operations you're trying to do
[14:30:00] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:30:07] <robertmaxrees> $(this).parent() is getting a .form-group
[14:30:25] <Velveeta> for instance, when you grab a handle to .quantity, and then .parent() and .children(.systemprice) you're searching the wrong container
[14:30:32] <robertmaxrees> try .closest('.form-inline').find('.grouptotal')
[14:30:34] <danziig> ok, so the reason I was doing that is because I'm cloning a bunhc of these
[14:30:35] <Velveeta> the parent of .quantity is div.form-group
[14:30:42] <danziig> ah
[14:30:56] <Velveeta> yeah, you need to go to a higher-level container and then search
[14:31:23] <Velveeta> and the input event listener is still wrong, it should be a change event listener
[14:31:24] <danziig> instead of the parent.child
[14:31:31] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta why can't it be input?
[14:31:36] <Velveeta> is input a thing?
[14:31:37] <robertmaxrees> that's a valid event.
[14:31:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[14:31:41] <Velveeta> well, news to me
[14:31:48] <Velveeta> what's it trigger on?
[14:31:55] <danziig> any input ;)
[14:32:00] <robertmaxrees> any keypress.
[14:32:12] <danziig> I'll go check and let you know, thank you!
[14:32:14] <Velveeta> gotcha, that makes sense
[14:32:51] <Velveeta> i would do change myself though, to trigger when they blur out, rather than recalculating per keypress
[14:33:47] <taplar> change you have to check type of key
[14:34:52] <Velveeta> check type of key?
[14:35:44] <taplar> input only fires for keys that actually change the value
[14:35:50] <danziig> like this?  Still nothing doing... https://jsfiddle.net/waynebunch/6og6tkxh/
[14:36:00] <danziig> wait
[14:36:01] <Velveeta> but change should only fire if they blur away from the field and the value has actually changed
[14:36:06] <danziig> damnit...one sec.  I forgot the others
[14:36:17] <taplar> true, i'm thinking of keydown or keyup
[14:36:40] <Velveeta> oh yeah those, i usually only those for things like checks for enter or escape
[14:37:13] <Velveeta> danziig: i know you're making other edits right now, but one thing i see that needs changing is .closest('form-inline') should be .closest('.form-inline')
[14:37:46] <danziig> bam!
[14:37:48] <danziig> thank you
[14:37:56] * Velveeta chestbumps danziig.
[14:38:03] <danziig> works like a charm, and now I see why
[14:39:09] <danziig> and just for reference...I used 'change' and it works, but only when I click out of the inputs
[14:39:14] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:39:16] <danziig> 'input' works as I type
[14:39:20] <robertmaxrees> because that's what change does :)
[14:39:51] <danziig> gotcha
[14:40:03] <Velveeta> rightio
[14:40:09] <Velveeta> so it just comes down to desired behavior
[14:40:13] <danziig> well now that I know I have a wealth of knowledge here, I'll be bugging you guys alot haha
[14:40:42] <danziig> take care I guess I should do some real work
[14:40:51] <danziig> instead of piddling around
[14:44:45] <WhirledPress> How do I chain .deferreds? instead of buildItem().then(buildOther().then(buildFinal)); there has got to be a way to buildItem().then(buildOther).then(buildFinal);
[14:45:27] <taplar> buildItem.then(buildOther).then(buildFinal); ?
[14:45:39] <taplar> yeah, that's valid
[14:46:04] <taplar> if i didn't leave of the leading () on the first method
[14:47:44] <WhirledPress> so buildItem returns a deferred promise, so does buildOther and buildFinal. Why doesn't the handler for the first promise fire again when the second promise is resolved?
[14:47:57] <robertmaxrees> because it can't.
[14:47:59] <taplar> it's already resolved
[14:48:07] <robertmaxrees> promises resolve or reject once.
[14:49:30] <WhirledPress> cool. I'm starting to get this, thanks for your help. if you have multiple .thens chained together, how does it know which promise you are resolving? Aren't there scope issues?
[14:49:35] <taplar> i mean, you might could structurely do it differently like
[14:50:01] <taplar> nah, nvm, that looks weird
[14:50:43] <taplar> it's resolving the promise it attached to
[14:51:10] <taplar> promise.then(blah), that then() returns the promise it acted upon
[14:51:52] <WhirledPress> I was thingking that the promise handler function defined in buildItem().then(promiseHandler) would be resolved so you couldn't have another .then
[14:52:05] <taplar> nah
[14:52:17] <taplar> resolve once, one to many following thens
[14:52:39] <WhirledPress> Rockin' Thanks.
[14:54:34] <CuriousMind> going home thanks guys again, ill sign on later or something
[14:54:40] <CuriousMind> gl everyone thanks again taplar
[14:54:56] <taplar> wha'd i do?
[14:55:00] <momomo> font-family on html or body .. and why?
[14:55:07] <taplar> momomo: either
[14:55:10] <CuriousMind> taplar: You always helpful plz lmao
[14:55:12] <robertmaxrees> momomo ask #css :)
[14:55:13] <CuriousMind> im going home im outties
[14:55:18] <CuriousMind> you too robertmaxrees ty bro
[14:55:32] <AwkwardCough> taplar: you were a moral authority on life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness
[14:55:39] <momomo> robertmaxrees, the experts are in here :P
[14:55:39] <taplar> 'were'?
[14:55:45] <taplar> dang
[14:55:47] <PCatinean> is this a legit selecto?
[14:55:47] <PCatinean> $('label span:contains("Fuel")').parent().siblings('div').find('select')
[14:55:51] <CuriousMind> taplar: and robertmaxrees are the experts pro af lmao
[14:55:55] <AwkwardCough> yeah you have really dropped the ball in the last few hours
[14:56:15] <taplar> hurts when it's made apparent...
[14:56:40] <taplar> PCatinean: what are you concerned about?
[14:56:52] <PCatinean> nothing, just seems a bit long but it's...legit I guess :)
[14:57:13] <CuriousMind> ok im leaving bye
[14:57:18] <taplar> it could definitely probably be made better with better usage of classes or something
[14:57:35] <robertmaxrees> ^ avoid :contains() and other psuedoselectors
[14:57:51] <taplar> and parent and siblings are very rigid structurely
[14:58:09] <PCatinean> taplar, true that yes, u'r right
[15:06:40] <jerry_> Can anybody tell me how to condense this code that runs once on load and once on window resize? http://pastebin.com/DGK4HaSW
[15:07:05] <taplar> functions!
[15:07:11] <robertmaxrees> why is that a jquery plugin?
[15:07:38] <robertmaxrees> $('asdfadsf').gridWidth(); wouldn't do anything with the selected element.
[15:07:51] <robertmaxrees> either way, what taplar said
[15:09:36] <jerry_> I pasted the wrong thing.
[15:09:42] <jerry_> http://pastebin.com/MuhvEpWn
[15:09:44] <taplar> also to robertmaxrees's point, your binding in that plugin
[15:09:49] <jerry_> Here we go.
[15:09:51] <taplar> so you wouldn't want to call it multiple times
[15:10:12] <robertmaxrees> so just $('.grid-item').css({'width': percentWidth + '%', 'height': percentWidth + "vw"}); ?
[15:10:18] <taplar> still the same answer
[15:10:23] <robertmaxrees> ^ use a function.
[15:10:33] <taplar> if you want to repeat logic, put that logic in a function and call that
[15:10:55] <jerry_> I guess that's what I'm asking. I don't know how to create a function in jquery that doesn't use a selector.
[15:11:02] <robertmaxrees> *javascript.
[15:11:08] <taplar> your creating one for that resize handler
[15:11:13] <taplar> it's just unnamed
[15:11:14] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lv8ghccv/
[15:11:14] <taplar> and inline
[15:11:28] <robertmaxrees> dunno why you think you need jquery for making a function.
[15:11:54] <taplar> now if you were asking about conjunctions i could understand.  though i would refer you to television
[15:11:55] <jerry_> robertmaxrees: it's because I tried to do it without jquery and it didn't work, but I must have typed something wrong.
[15:12:41] <taplar> oh i bet i know what it is
[15:12:51] <taplar> resize is not re-computing the variables
[15:13:30] <taplar> well, the original, robert's is
[15:13:56] <jerry_> The original works, but I'll try robert's code now. Thanks
[15:14:23] <taplar> btw, you should look into using possibly vw and vh for your dimensions instead
[15:14:31] <robertmaxrees> and also debounce that sucker.
[15:14:33] <taplar> could remove the need for js all together
[15:14:39] <robertmaxrees> or throttle it.
[15:14:49] <robertmaxrees> though yeah, this could be all done via css it looks like.
[15:15:29] <jerry_> I tried to do it in css but I didn't figure out how.
[15:15:43] <taplar> ##css nifty channel
[15:17:04] <WhirledPress> so I have a function buildThumb() that returns a promise   buildThumb().then(buildBody).fail(buildNext).then(buildNext)  ??  I'm trying to say, if buildThumb's promise is rejected, don't fire buildBoy, just buildNext.  but if it resolves, buildBody then buildNext
[15:17:26] <taplar> then(successHandler, errorHandler)
[15:17:38] <WhirledPress> so much better, thanks.
[15:17:53] <taplar> err, Handler should be Callback, :D
[15:19:52] <WhirledPress> the documentation for .done are strange.
[15:20:07] <taplar> prefer then() when possible
[15:20:17] <robertmaxrees> yeah use .then()
[15:21:02] <AcidRain_> guys, http://pastebin.com/aAEatbeD   this script is locking up my chrome tabs. no clue why
[15:21:15] <AcidRain_> devtools isnt letting me know anything. it gets disconnected
[15:21:29] <robertmaxrees> when you submit or...?
[15:21:48] <AcidRain_> yes sir, when i submit
[15:22:19] <AcidRain_> i have restarted chrome. same thing
[15:22:40] <robertmaxrees> can you reproduce in a fiddle?
[15:22:44] <taplar> lol, surely the attribute selectors are not making it crap out
[15:22:56] <robertmaxrees> those wouldn't make it lock.
[15:23:10] <robertmaxrees> AcidRain_ what happens if you comment out the post?
[15:23:44] <taplar> and/or change that alert to a console.log
[15:23:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah don't use alerts for debugging.
[15:24:07] <robertmaxrees> i'd start commenting things out and seeing what happens.
[15:24:26] <AcidRain_> >_>
[15:24:37] <robertmaxrees> or use your step debugger.
[15:24:38] <taplar> debugging 101
[15:24:43] <AcidRain_> taplar, you gave it away. sry. lol. i was just trying to get it done real quick
[15:24:47] <AcidRain_> was the selectors
[15:24:50] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:24:51] <taplar> wat?!
[15:24:53] <robertmaxrees> no way.
[15:25:02] <taplar> i was kidding
[15:25:03] <robertmaxrees> there's something really broken about your markup then.
[15:25:05] <AcidRain_> well, the attribute. should have been ....val()
[15:25:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:25:18] <AcidRain_> var email = form.find("input[name='email']").val();
[15:25:19] <taplar> oh
[15:25:20] <taplar> lol
[15:25:25] <taplar> but still...
[15:25:31] <taplar> lock up the browser?
[15:25:31] <robertmaxrees> that shouldn't cause the browser to lock.
[15:25:35] <robertmaxrees> you've got another problem.
[15:25:57] <AcidRain_> just 1 tab. it eventually... gives me the error saying "this page cannot be displayed properly"
[15:26:01] <AcidRain_> something fo the sort
[15:26:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you've got bad markup.
[15:26:12] <robertmaxrees> that's my guess at least.
[15:26:16] <robertmaxrees> or a weird copy of jquery.
[15:26:20] <AcidRain_> i can fiddle the issue if u want
[15:26:34] <taplar> i'm refactoring this shidizzle
[15:27:40] <AcidRain_> rep, reproduced it in a fiddle
[15:27:47] <AcidRain_> now hang on, gotta save it this time
[15:28:32] <AcidRain_> https://jsfiddle.net/egwja7af/1/
[15:29:01] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/wt8vkn1n/
[15:29:43] <AcidRain_> does it not lock the tab for yall?
[15:29:43] <taplar> shouldn't really be $ on the val() results, but meh
[15:29:47] <AcidRain_> like for... 15sec
[15:29:54] <robertmaxrees> iiiiiiiiiiiinteresting.
[15:30:25] <taplar> not in ff, one sec
[15:30:33] <AcidRain_> hmmm
[15:30:42] <AcidRain_> oh well. i know how to not lock it up now so
[15:31:14] <taplar> yup, locked
[15:31:24] <alluringme> AcidRain_ In chrome yes.
[15:31:30] <taplar> and my fan kicked into high gear on my laptop
[15:31:33] <taplar> :D
[15:31:54] <robertmaxrees> something tells me it has to do with how jq tries to serialize the object before sending it off.
[15:32:07] <taplar> maybe that was just odd timing
[15:32:34] <taplar> it didn't lock up for me in ff though rob
[15:32:57] <robertmaxrees> aye - probably specific to chrome's serialization.
[15:33:01] <taplar> ah
[15:33:25] <AcidRain_> sir rob has been challenged lol
[15:33:35] <robertmaxrees> ew.
[15:33:35] <taplar> but yeah, use val() correctly and also take a look at my fiddle for a use of filter()
[15:33:37] <robertmaxrees> "sir"
[15:34:02] <AcidRain_> taplar, yea i saw the fitler() example you posted. i shall implement this now and for future
[15:34:29] <taplar> crap, typo...
[15:34:53] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/wt8vkn1n/1/
[15:35:13] <taplar> i was filtering on the form, :/
[15:36:08] <alluringme> I see this "Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded" on console AcidRain_
[15:36:24] <alluringme> Hey robertmaxrees how have you been?? :D
[15:36:43] <robertmaxrees> i've been alright.  livin'.  breathin'.
[15:36:47] <robertmaxrees> keepin' out of trouble.
[15:36:53] <alluringme> Great to hear that. :D
[15:37:06] <robertmaxrees> eh, not really all that great heh but thanks.
[15:37:35] <alluringme> Well, e1 has ups and down's . > LIFE :O
[15:37:47] <robertmaxrees> i haven't had a whole lot of ups for a while.
[15:37:51] <taplar> e1?

[15:38:47] <alluringme> Thought, I'd say hi. Have a good one.
[15:38:48] * taplar is confuzzled
[15:38:57] <robertmaxrees> he means "everyone"
[15:38:58] <AwkwardCough> taplar: e1 == everyone
[15:39:12] <taplar> ah
[15:39:18] <alluringme> Oh, sorry taplar. Yes, I meant everyone. :)
[15:39:31] <taplar> i feel old
[15:39:38] <robertmaxrees> stfu
[15:39:43] <robertmaxrees> i'm probably older than you are.
[15:39:46] <alluringme> Heh.
[15:39:57] <taplar> fine, dumb.  robert wins
[15:39:59] <taplar> lol

[15:44:32] <taplar> lol
[15:44:46] <taplar> i drew a comic about that actually today.  need to digitize it and put it on fb
[15:44:55] <graphettion> haha
[15:45:38] <WhirledPress> taplar, robertmaxrees, thanks a lot for your help. I'm gonna spend some time with my puppy and come back to this.
[15:45:50] <taplar> mmm, i envy you
[15:46:18] <AwkwardCough> I wonder if a workplace dog would make the environment more relaxed or less productive
[15:46:27] <taplar> both
[15:46:31] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[15:46:47] <robertmaxrees> depends on the dog.  a few of my coworkers bring theirs in pretty regularly.
[15:47:09] <WhirledPress> <--retired
[15:47:12] <taplar> on the plus side, you really wouldn't see a change in the shade of our carpet over time
[15:47:47] <taplar> you know what i'm talking about AwkwardCough
[15:48:07] <taplar> come on, give me one
[15:48:17] <ChkDigit> ^5?
[15:48:26] <taplar> no, his signature
[15:48:38] <ChkDigit> I'll give you a ^5 anyway.
[15:48:43] <taplar> :D
[15:48:50] <AwkwardCough> is that all I am to you taplar? just a joke? just a name for your amusement?!?!?!?!
[15:48:57] <taplar> uhhhh, yah
[15:48:57] * AwkwardCough 
[15:49:01] <taplar> ^_^
[15:49:35] <bonerx2k> using moment.js, and utcOffset, i get the wrong time because of DST.  Anyone know how to adjust utc with dst factored in automatically?
[15:50:31] <robertmaxrees> http://momentjs.com/timezone/docs/#/using-timezones/parsing-in-zone/
[15:50:31] <graphettion> robertmaxrees, that's pretty cool - bring your dog into work
[15:50:50] <taplar> provided they are quiet
[15:51:00] <graphettion> Yeah, don't want a beagle.
[15:51:01] <robertmaxrees> ^ and not a little jerk.  like my shepherd
[15:51:09] <graphettion> haha
[15:51:43] * ChkDigit kept his GSD at work for the last 10 weeks of his life.  People enjoyed having him around.
[15:51:59] <robertmaxrees> awwww.
[15:52:05] <robertmaxrees> that's actually pretty sweet.
[15:52:51] <graphettion> That is very cool.
[15:53:22] <taplar> yeah, GSD rock.  love em.  they'er all D and G and yeah
[15:54:11] * taplar whispers to AwkwardCough "wtf is that?"
[15:54:23] <AwkwardCough> taplar: GSD == German Shepard
[15:54:23] <robertmaxrees> (german shepherd dog)
[15:54:28] <z1haze_work> can i do this: $grid.on('click, hover', '.grid-item', function (event) { ?
[15:54:32] <taplar> dude, way to keep it low key
[15:54:44] <robertmaxrees> hey you know i try.
[15:55:01] <taplar> z1haze_work: no comma in the events
[15:55:11] <z1haze_work> but i can do multiple events though?
[15:55:14] <taplar> yup

[15:59:37] <graphettion> Well, a dog similar to that. Not mine.
[15:59:44] <taplar> cool
[16:00:10] <graphettion> Yeah, we always made fun of doxon calling it Oscar Meyer, etc.
[16:00:19] <taplar> i'm trying to figure out if he's like "pet me!" or "what the f you doing taking a pic of my junk?!"  notice the paw placement
[16:00:32] <graphettion> latter, FTW!
[16:00:55] <taplar> he knows what's up

[16:05:10] <taplar> i thought he changed back?
[16:05:20] <graphettion> Prolly did. I don't keep up, lol
[16:06:36] <taplar> the artist formerly known as lion formerly known as himself
[16:07:12] <taplar> anyway, dang, someone as a jquery question
[16:07:16] <graphettion> Symbols are a great way to express yourself.

[16:15:46] <AwkwardCough> Ive learned alot about snoop today apparently
[16:17:24] <robertmaxrees> for rizzle dizzle
[16:28:31] <taplar> ty for point me towards 7 days
[16:30:56] <taplar> though now that has led me to some craig david...
[16:36:14] <z1haze_work> I have a tricky issue here: http://dev04-web-kendo.demandware.net/on/demandware.store/Sites-MJB-Site if you scrolle down about halfway and click on the 'shop this look' black bar in the middle it will open a little isotope widget type thing. hovering the elements in there will cause them to slidedown, mouseleave causes them to slideup. my issue is
[16:36:14] <z1haze_work> that if you hover, leave, and come back to soon, something crazy happens and the height gets set to 0 and basically disappears.
[16:36:31] <z1haze_work> I know its a terrible experience, i have it binded to click events but the client wanted hover
[16:40:50] <taplar> wow you can make it go crazy
[16:42:29] <roamingdog> i'm moving from an old foundation orbit slideshow to something i can use with bootstrap - but i need a block of caption html to appear to the right of the image. seems this was built-in to orbit, is there another plugin that does similar?
[16:44:14] <taplar> z1haze_work: it doesn't seem like, hovers and/or leaves are being cancelled and are stacking
[16:45:33] <taplar> like if i take my cursor and hover over the pencil and then start bouncing back and forth from it to the red lipstick a number of times and then leave them both, the animation keeps playing
[16:45:51] <robertmaxrees> queues
[16:47:41] <taplar> i mean it's kinda cool if you put it to music, but...
[16:50:25] <fission6> hello, how would i write code to do the following, https://jsfiddle.net/p7b89fmj/
[16:50:52] <fission6> basically enable the respective Submit buttons when the check boxes are all checked that are immediatly above it
[16:52:03] <taplar> first put a class on the parent div of each grouping
[16:52:14] <taplar> and one on the submit buttons
[16:52:40] <taplar> then delegate bind change on the divs and check if all the children are selected, if so, enable the button
[16:54:17] <fission6> taplar: could you jazz up my fiddle to show me what to do, esp that last part?
[16:54:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:55:12] <taplar> which part confuses you?
[16:55:18] <fission6> the last part particually
[16:55:24] <fission6> "delegate bind change on the divs "
[16:55:45] <taplar> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[16:56:39] <fission6> taplar: updated https://jsfiddle.net/p7b89fmj/3/
[16:56:48] <fission6> not sure what to put for the js/jquery
[16:57:07] <taplar> take a look at that learn page
[16:57:18] <taplar> it explains delegates and has some examples
[17:00:21] <taplar> also side note, try to be descriptive with your class names. 'parent' works, but if you read that in the js, would you know what it was without looking at the markup?
[17:09:19] <jerry_> I just found my first jsfiddle. So embarrassing.
[17:10:24] <taplar> ?
[17:17:18] <fission6> taplar: event delegation is beta, i dont think my jquery version supports it
[17:17:24] <fission6> is there another approach
[17:17:25] <robertmaxrees> no it's not.
[17:17:26] <taplar> uh, no it's not
[17:17:36] <robertmaxrees> event delegation has been supported for a very long time.
[17:17:40] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you using?
[17:18:16] <fission6> OHH sorry the docs im reading say beta
[17:18:25] <robertmaxrees> what docs are you reading?
[17:18:25] <fission6> ill review thanks taplar  robertmaxrees
[17:18:39] <fission6> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[17:18:44] <fission6> says beta upper right
[17:18:51] <robertmaxrees> those are for the docs.
[17:18:53] <robertmaxrees> not the feature.
[17:19:02] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[17:38:37] <fission6> robertmaxrees: thanks ya makes sense OK ill review and get some code going for a review in here perhaps!
[17:38:38] <fission6> thnaks!
[18:04:52] <fission6> in the event delegatoin how do i get the element the binding is on vs the element that triggered the event
[18:05:02] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[18:05:11] <robertmaxrees> usually people just .closest() for the class they care about
[18:05:24] <cwolter> i am trying to make a div droppable and my draggable objects "snap" into the droppable
[18:05:37] <robertmaxrees> fission6 otherwise https://api.jquery.com/event.delegateTarget/
[18:05:48] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/ for more general event object info.
[18:05:55] <fission6> ok
[18:06:15] <fission6> thanks robertmaxrees !
[18:06:19] <robertmaxrees> yarp
[18:06:22] <cwolter> right now, it still appears that I can drag anywhere on the page
[18:06:47] <cwolter> $('#divid').droppable();
[18:06:50] <robertmaxrees> cwolter so you want to limi where you can drop to?
[18:06:58] <cwolter> i think so
[18:07:15] <robertmaxrees> like, you only want to be able to drop inside of a specific element?
[18:07:48] <cwolter> the teacher says to set the cursor: "move" on the draggable object with a grid parameter so it snaps into the droppable div
[18:08:11] <robertmaxrees> check out http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/
[18:09:04] <cwolter> i assume that means to drop only into a specific div
[18:09:09] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:09:17] <robertmaxrees> plus sets a specific cursor.
[18:09:26] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs :)
[18:09:29] <robertmaxrees> they explain it all.
[18:10:39] <cwolter> ok, i have followed the teachers instructions. it's just confusing when she says "Also, set the grid option to "[25, 34]" so a task will snap into the droppable area."
[18:11:05] <cwolter> i've done that on the draggable object, but still lets me place it anywhere on the page
[18:11:18] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have some more reading to do then :)
[18:11:26] <cwolter> am i expecting a behavior different than what should be happening
[18:11:34] <robertmaxrees> i have no ide.a
[18:11:41] <cwolter> ok
[18:11:43] <robertmaxrees> i don't know your teacher and i don't have the assignment in front of me.
[18:11:50] <cwolter> i understand
[18:11:57] <cwolter> i don't know my teacher either
[18:12:05] <robertmaxrees> you know what i mean.
[18:12:12] <cwolter> i do
[18:12:43] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/20898922
[18:13:11] <cwolter> thanks, i will check it out
[18:13:18] <robertmaxrees> searching google should help here.
[18:13:25] <cwolter> i didn't see this article when i searched stackoverflow
[18:13:37] <cwolter> guess i'm using wrong description of my situation
[18:13:38] <robertmaxrees> "jquery draggable constrain to drop" - i searched that in google.
[18:14:21] <fission6> robertmaxrees: taplar would you both mind providing feedback on my solution, https://jsfiddle.net/p7b89fmj/5/
[18:15:04] <taplar> appears to work
[18:15:16] <robertmaxrees> let me show you a fre things.
[18:15:20] <fission6> any code recs or style recs
[18:15:37] <taplar> better class name, 'parent' is vague
[18:15:42] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:15:51] <taplar> what does that div represent?
[18:16:07] <fission6> ya i will clean that all up when i apply this code / concept to my application just prototyping
[18:16:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:16:25] <taplar> ok, then logically, what if i select them all and then unselect one
[18:16:26] <robertmaxrees> so you'll clean it up but you want feedback now?
[18:16:32] <fission6> the Div represents an order and all the products in it are the li's, i want to have check boxes next to each item in the order
[18:16:56] <taplar> so why not make the class 'order' ?
[18:16:57] <fission6> robertmaxrees: yes on the approach, your "parent" comment is noted
[18:17:01] <fission6> i will taplar
[18:17:06] <fission6> anything on the js end?
[18:17:14] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[18:17:15] <taplar> that is the js end
[18:17:19] <fission6> i agree the uncheck is a huge gap, haha
[18:17:29] <taplar> the class name is on both ends
[18:18:30] <taplar> if ( $('.a').find('.b').filter(':checked').length < 1 ) { console.log('nothing answered'); }
[18:18:33] <taplar> how readable is that?
[18:18:36] <robertmaxrees> almost done.
[18:19:06] <taplar> if ( $('.question').find('.answer').filter(':checked').length < 1 ) { console.log('nothing answered'); }
[18:19:10] <taplar> how readable is that?
[18:19:20] <robertmaxrees> :) i'm headed in that direction.
[18:19:52] <taplar> regardless of the markup, you can read that and have an idea of what is happening
[18:21:32] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p7b89fmj/6/
[18:21:35] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[18:23:54] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p7b89fmj/9/ or this.
[18:24:04] <robertmaxrees> you get the idea.
[18:26:03] <fission6> excellent thank you so much robertmaxrees taplar
[18:26:13] <fission6> will review and encorproate, enjoy your weekends!
[18:46:09] <danziig> https://jsfiddle.net/waynebunch/0ho0fhdr/2/ - I'm back at it again!  Changed it up a little, but still not getting what I need.  After the prompt and the div's clone, only the first `group` will multiply `quantity` and `systemprice`.  Any ideas?
[18:47:01] <robertmaxrees> $('.quantity').on('input', function() {
[18:47:12] <robertmaxrees> this only works for whatever exists on pageload.
[18:47:16] <robertmaxrees> you want a delegated listener.
[18:47:24] <robertmaxrees> also: you can't clone #groupContainer
[18:47:33] <robertmaxrees> you end up repeating that id, which is invalid.
[18:47:42] <danziig> yea I was wondering about that
[18:47:48] <danziig> but that's why I gave it a class :)
[18:47:51] <danziig> no good?
[18:48:02] <robertmaxrees> it still has an ID.
[18:48:07] <robertmaxrees> the id is still on the cloned node.
[18:48:14] <robertmaxrees> it cannot have an id at all.
[18:48:19] <robertmaxrees> unless the ID changes.
[18:48:37] <danziig> I could add a 1 to each I suppose
[18:48:48] <robertmaxrees> why do you need an ID?
[18:48:53] <danziig> I guess I don't
[18:48:56] <danziig> let me look
[18:49:04] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:50:34] <danziig> how else would I call it in my cloneGroups function?
[18:50:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:51:01] <robertmaxrees> oh, easy.
[18:51:10] <robertmaxrees> var group = document.getElementById('groupContainer'); -> var group = $(';
[18:51:12] <robertmaxrees> woops.,
[18:51:34] <robertmaxrees> var group = $('.groupcontainer');
[18:51:41] <robertmaxrees> then use jquery's .clone() and append.
[18:51:58] <danziig> ah yes...I remember I was trying to use pure javascript when I did that
[18:52:00] <danziig> just to learn
[18:52:07] <danziig> Jquery would be the easier way
[18:52:10] <robertmaxrees> actually.:
[18:52:13] <robertmaxrees> that'll break.
[18:53:46] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0ho0fhdr/3/
[18:54:04] <robertmaxrees> that's what you want.  how are you submitting this?  ajax?
[18:56:53] <danziig> I see...no submitting.  I'm making a quote template for work.  But it's really just a learning exercise.  It's just an html file I open in chrome
[18:57:30] <danziig> to make a sales quote
[19:00:40] <robertmaxrees> ah
[19:00:41] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[19:00:42] <danziig> So once these are cloned, there's no way manipulate those clones?
[19:00:47] <robertmaxrees> sure there is.
[19:00:51] <robertmaxrees> why wouldn't there be?
[19:01:25] <danziig> bah..from my reading the parent().children() way should be best, so I keep going back to that
[19:01:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:01:44] <robertmaxrees> your markup structure is weird fwiw.
[19:01:56] <danziig> yea I wasn't too worried about that
[19:02:08] <danziig> the functionality is what I am trying to figure out
[19:02:16] <robertmaxrees> so what are you stuck on now?
[19:02:24] <robertmaxrees> because that markup will bit you eventually.
[19:04:36] <danziig> the only thing I need to get it to do until I fix the markup:  each clone needs to work like the original.... quantity val * systemprice val => `grouptotal`.  No matter how many groups there are
[19:04:46] <danziig> it's still only the first one that gives a product
[19:05:47] <robertmaxrees> so that's going to be really difficult until you fix the markup.
[19:07:53] <robertmaxrees> because it'll be hard to match the inputs that changed with one another.
[19:08:48] <danziig> yea I'm seeing that
[19:08:53] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[19:08:57] <robertmaxrees> hence better grouping.
[19:13:01] <danziig> that's kind of what I was getting at earlier...I assumed that with my $(this).parent().children('.grouptotal') it would correctly match each clone's input..that make sense?
[19:13:49] <danziig> or any of the $(this).parent().children(blah) would reference it's own, and that would work
[19:14:34] <robertmaxrees> that's... not how I would do this :)
[19:14:50] <danziig> :)
[19:15:00] <robertmaxrees> you're close though.
[19:17:10] <danziig> alright, thanks for your help.  I'll be back to pick some brains, later.
[19:17:14] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[19:17:20] <robertmaxrees> unless you really need to go.
[19:17:26] <robertmaxrees> because this is easiy to fix.
[19:17:29] <danziig> ok
[19:17:32] <danziig> I'm all eyes
[19:20:13] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0ho0fhdr/6/
[19:20:14] <robertmaxrees> something like that.
[19:20:44] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0ho0fhdr/7/
[19:20:47] <robertmaxrees> with working calculations.
[19:22:15] <danziig> wonderful!
[19:22:28] <danziig> I get what you mean by the markup
[19:24:15] <danziig> I do need to leave though, thank you and I'll be back after I check out the fiddle some more
[19:24:17] <danziig> later
[20:42:37] <fredyfx> hi there :D Does anyone have knowledge on jquery-ui?
[20:43:24] <fredyfx> i am thinking i found a bug on the dropdowns
[20:43:49] <Getty> lol then the bugtracker might be a better target ;) but AFAIK there is a jquery-ui channel #jqueryui or #jquery-ui i dont know
[20:44:07] <Getty> or was at least ;)
[20:45:05] <fredyfx> nobody reply on #jquery-ui
[20:45:18] <Getty> ha nobody probably will here ;)
[20:45:33] <fredyfx> lol
[20:49:00] <fredyfx> this is my situation: i have 2 buttons: create and edit, when i click on create or edit, a modal is displayed. On that modal, i have a select with data, if it is a new entry and you click that select, the dropdown list will be displayed, then close the modal, and everything is gone (which is what i expected) but when you open an item using edit button, that modal has data, that dropdown list has a value, so, when you click to open th
[20:49:21] <fredyfx> modal, the modal is gone but the list stills open
[20:49:49] <fredyfx> thank you for reading :D
[21:38:08] <ElGatoSaez> Hello.
[21:38:17] <ElGatoSaez> I'm using :contains
[21:38:37] <taplar> always sad to hear when a person is using
[21:38:39] <ElGatoSaez> before contains I need to put something like div, p
[21:38:57] <ElGatoSaez> How can I put there multiple stuff like span, div, p
[21:39:08] <ElGatoSaez> I've been using * but I need just some
[21:39:23] <taplar> your wanting to find multiple things that contain something?
[21:39:57] <ElGatoSaez> yes
[21:40:34] <taplar> $('selector1, selector2, selector3').filter(function(){ return this.innerHTML.indexOf(yourstring) > -1; });
[21:41:03] <taplar> avoid pseudo selectors when you can.  they can be slow
[21:41:27] <ElGatoSaez> but it's not using contain
[21:41:37] <taplar> right, due to my last sentence
[21:42:25] <ElGatoSaez> oh
[23:12:10] <ningu> what's the normal way of loading a static json file that is needed in js code? just do an ajax request?
[23:12:21] <ningu> as long as that isn't less efficient than a script tag
[23:13:31] <taplar> ajax request is fine, unless you can put it on the page itself
[23:17:36] <ningu> ok
[23:17:43] <ningu> yeah, it's easier to put it in a separate file
