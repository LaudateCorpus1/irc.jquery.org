[01:38:47] <mivan0v> https://bpa.st/UYZQ - CData.start_or_cont_tutorial is called 5 times. Why does the script only scrollIntoView() for the first iteration and not the others? (scroll to bottom of page where salient elements are, but 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th iterations are at top of page out of view of salient elements, as if reset)
[01:40:38] <robertmaxrees> without seeing it in action, no clue.
[01:41:19] <robertmaxrees> do all of these elements exist on pageload?
[02:22:04] <Cork> yay, it's always lovely when ppl ask a question and then just leave
[02:22:29] <Cork> (the problem is he binds a click handler every time show_slide is called, but never cleans it up)
[02:22:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah...
[02:24:36] <robertmaxrees> saw the question was sent to multiple channels, so i took a cursory look and decided to see if they were actually going to follow up to any questions first :shrug:
[02:25:02] <Cork> ah, your right, missed that :/
[02:25:16] <robertmaxrees> it's all good :)
[02:25:31] <undefined_bob> hello you two. Are you doing alright? :)
[02:26:07] <Cork> can't complain
[02:26:12] <robertmaxrees> just hanging out :)
[02:26:19] <undefined_bob> nice :)
[07:33:09] <johanmlg> Hello! https://jqueryui.com/themeroller/ have been broken a few days, its throwing 404's and javascript errors in the console. Do anyone in here know if/when that will be fixed?
[07:52:07] <Cork> johanmlg: no, it has been sporadically down for the last 2 years
[07:52:15] <Cork> (and most of the time for months on end)
[08:26:39] <johanmlg> @Cork: Hmm, so I guess we just have to wait until the next month for it to come back up?
[08:27:19] <Cork> johanmlg: no, you can use the files from github.com or code.jquery.com/ui
[08:27:32] <Cork> but don't expect themeroller to come back anytime soon (or ever)
[08:28:54] <Cork> it's not that it starts up again after a while, it is that someone goes and fixes it, but it's been very hard to get in contact with the ones responsible for the infrastructure for jquery ui
[08:31:59] <johanmlg> aha, i see. Im in need of creating a custom theme, and while playing with themeroller the other day it took me about 90% of the way to where I needed to be. Not having to manually override classes would save quite some amount of time. Is there any other way of creating a custom theme for jquery ui?
[08:34:59] <Cork> there was a third party backup of it i saw a bit over a year ago, but don't think that is still up an dunning
[08:36:27] <Cork> you might be able to get something going with https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui-themeroller
[08:36:30] <Cork> no clue though
[08:39:32] <johanmlg> thanks! yea, that does seem like a way forward. thank you!
