[05:15:30] <jomofcw> Hello !
[05:16:48] <jomofcw> Is there a way to test if there is an element explicitely ":checked" in a SELECT, please ? Curently, it always tell me that there is a ":checked" including when no OPTION is explictely selected.
[05:18:32] <Cork> jomofcw: is the select a multi select?
[05:20:40] <jomofcw> Hello Cork :).
[05:20:48] <jomofcw> Cork, nop.
[05:20:59] <jomofcw> In fact, it detect the first element as "checked" by default.
[05:21:04] <Cork> then just check $(select).val() == value of option
[05:22:29] <jomofcw> Hm OK I get it ^^ thanks for the tips Cork :).
[05:36:52] <diverdude> hi, i have an image of size 1920x1200. I want to display that in a box which is around 500 pix high and maintains aspect ratio. Then I want to make a functionality where when mouse is hovering on image, the image is shown at full resolution in a popup - however only in the area where the mouse is. Effectively it becomes a zoom functionality. How can I implement this?
[05:39:58] <Cork> diverdude: use a img tag
[05:40:53] <diverdude> Cork: ok and how do i convey where the mouse is - and how do i show only that part in the new window?
[05:42:36] <Cork> diverdude: the mousemove event
[05:44:08] <diverdude> Cork: ok and the "only show area around x,y" part ?
[05:45:18] <Cork> x,y is provided in the event
[05:47:45] <diverdude> Cork: hmm but mousemove event shows only coordinates in zoomed out coordinate system: https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/657652/
[05:48:13] <Cork> diverdude: ya?
[05:49:15] <diverdude> Cork: i would need the original x,y right? ie from the actual image...and not just the container coordinates
[05:49:37] <Cork> you can only get the x,y from the element
[05:49:45] <Cork> you will have to convert it based on the size difference
[05:50:13] <diverdude> Cork: i see....but why is the size 307 when i set it to 300?
[05:50:31] <Cork> padding, lineheight most likely
[05:52:05] <diverdude> Cork: hmm no i set those to 0 for img tag
[05:53:14] <Cork> body { margin: 0; }
[05:55:09] <diverdude> oh...how weird thats also counted as image siz
[05:55:21] <Cork> no, it isn't image size
[05:55:26] <Cork> it is cursor position
[05:56:45] <diverdude> from top left corner of page?
[05:56:57] <Cork> exactly
[05:57:48] <Cork> if you want of the image use clientX and clientY
[05:58:40] <diverdude> no that gives same result
[05:59:34] <Cork> have you bound the event on the correct element?
[06:00:09] <diverdude> Cork: i bound it on the img tag
[06:01:38] <diverdude> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/657698/
[06:02:33] <Cork> hmm not sure why that would happen...
[06:02:44] <Cork> oh, well you can subtract the $(this).position() values
[06:04:18] <hellyeah> why it is not working https://jsfiddle.net/0fhjmzpa/4/?
[06:04:51] <diverdude> Cork: this works:   var offset = $(this).offset();   var relativeX = (e.pageX - offset.left);   var relativeY = (e.pageY - offset.top);   msg += relativeX + ", " + relativeY;
[06:04:53] <hellyeah> it gave me hadhache
[06:05:33] <Woet> hellyeah: because that's not how you open dialogs.
[06:06:03] <Woet> hellyeah: also, you're not loading jQuery UI.
[06:06:30] <hellyeah> i did
[06:06:39] <hellyeah> jquery 1.9.1 with jquery ui
[06:07:56] <Woet> ok, it didn't show up in the short text, you gotta expand it
[06:08:11] <hellyeah> expand what exactly?
[06:08:20] <Woet> don't worry about it
[06:08:26] <Woet> the only issue is you not opening dialogs properly.
[06:08:37] <Woet> hellyeah: maybe you'd have less of a headache if you'd look at the documentation and examples in regards to opening dialogs.
[06:09:06] <hellyeah> i worked with dialogs before
[06:09:14] <hellyeah> afaik this should do the trick $(".dialog").dialog();
[06:09:27] <Woet> no, that should not do the trick
[06:09:32] <Woet> something you would know if you'd look at the documentation and examples
[06:10:06] <Woet> or literally any google result for "jquery open dialog"
[06:10:53] <Woet> it honestly baffles me how you can come here over and over again asking questions and each time, without fail, ignore documentation, examples and Google results.
[06:11:03] <Woet> i think it's literally been more than 10 times by now
[06:12:03] <hellyeah> dude this is working example http://jsfiddle.net/dapjyu91/1/
[06:12:11] <hellyeah> can you tell me what is the difference?
[06:13:29] <Woet> no, open your eyes and look yourself
[06:15:09] <diverdude> xorso i have mouse pointer in image coordinates. how do i scroll to that point in big picture?
[06:15:52] <diverdude> Cork: i have mouse pointer in image coordinates. how do i scroll to that point in big picture?
[06:24:21] <thykka> diverdude, you can get the relative position with [mouseX / imageWidth, mouseY / imageHeight], and that point can then be used as a transform offset
[06:35:10] <diverdude> ok...for some reason this gives image in full height when the mouse is moving over the full image: http://jsfiddle.net/uwNKe/315/    I cannot find the error. Can anyone see what I am doing wrong?
[07:08:12] <Cork> diverdude: you might want to use something like http://www.elevateweb.co.uk/image-zoom/examples#basic-zoom
[07:09:40] <Deusdeorum> I am looking for a package that has a nicer alert box than the usual alert, does anyone know of such package which dead easy to use? =)
[07:12:09] <diverdude> Cork: i actually almost have it: http://jsfiddle.net/uwNKe/317/    it works great now. I just need to figure out how to however zoom next to mouse
[07:48:14] <thykka> I wouldn't use background-position for this
[07:48:19] <thykka> transform is way faster
[07:48:23] <Cork> ya
[07:54:23] <diverdude> thykka: ok - can you show me an example of how to do this using transform?
[07:54:36] <thykka> diverdude, yeah, just a minute..
[07:54:59] <diverdude> thykka: thanks so much mate. I really appreciate it
[08:02:32] <thykka> diverdude, http://jsfiddle.net/2zhcvwpk/13/
[08:03:30] <thykka> oops.. not quite there yet
[08:07:19] <thykka> http://jsfiddle.net/2zhcvwpk/21/
[08:08:21] <hellyeah> diverdude,  is that what you want?
[08:08:35] <hellyeah> this is like magnifier
[08:12:30] <thykka> could be better if the image was swapped out into a high resolution version when zooming, while using a low resolution version for the thumbnail
[08:13:30] <diverdude> ahhh mmmm not quite.... i was looking for functionality like this: http://jsfiddle.net/uwNKe/317/   where i can both see full image and zoom
[08:14:23] <diverdude> thykka: is that possible using your technique?
[08:14:34] <thykka> sure
[08:15:27] <thykka> you'll just need to add another image and apply the transformation to that, instead of the small image
[08:15:43] <thykka> ...and a container to limit the large image
[08:15:55] <thykka> but the principle is very much the same
[08:17:53] <diverdude> thykka: yes ok....mmmm is there any way you can show me....?
[08:19:07] <thykka> maybe you try it first, then ask if there's a particular problem?
[08:20:55] <diverdude> thykka: ok - how long are you online here? :D
[08:21:23] <thykka> I'm always online, although not necessarily active
[08:22:12] <AdamPDotty> thykka - online since 1989/03/07
[08:22:14] <diverdude> thykka: ok....i have to run quickly, and when i get back I will give it a go. Hope you are still around :) And thanks so much for your help already
[08:23:02] <thykka> AdamPDotty, almost... "uptime: 217 days 04:40:02, started on Wed, 17 Jan 2018 09:42:40"
[08:26:05] <Deusdeorum> Why is this alert being triggered twice? And how to trigger only once if you press radio or label? http://jsfiddle.net/d2hxnaLz/2
[08:28:24] <Deusdeorum> ^ I only want to trigger once when you hit <li></li>
[08:51:27] <pavonia> Deusdeorum: I think you want a .change() on the input instead
[08:52:07] <pavonia> Not sure why it fires twice, probably because the label already triggers an extra event
[09:08:06] <MikeD_> Deusdeorum: http://jsfiddle.net/d2hxnaLz/12/  the label is causing the radio to bubble an event in addition to the label event bubbling
[09:09:03] <Deusdeorum> thanks guys!'
[09:24:45] <interop_madness> should a "destroy" plugin method allow chaining or rather have no return value?
[09:25:03] <interop_madness> i.e. should $(selector).myPlugin("destroy") return $?
[09:34:33] <diverdude> thykka: im back - still here?
[09:34:55] <thykka> yeah, for a while
[09:37:04] <diverdude> thykka: ok...im will attempt to split your example into 2 images now
[09:38:11] <diverdude> thykka: so i will make an additional img tag right?
[09:38:36] <thykka> right
[09:43:23] <diverdude> thykka: so i keep your container"zoomable" with full resolution image (1920x1200) inside, and then i make an img tag next to it with eg. height 400?
[09:52:27] <thykka> right
[10:04:42] <RandomSerb> hello. Can anyone please tell me how to add value to the elem, in https://www.screencast.com/t/r12Et6Cjz3yV
[10:06:39] <spaces> erm, is formName.reset() not possible ?
[11:20:34] <diverdude> thykka: why have you selected exactly 1 and 3 as zoom parameters?
[11:24:40] <diverdude> thykka: what does it mean that you set height: 0; on the container div?
[11:27:04] <diverdude> thykka: ahh ok ....3 is just how much zoom there is
[11:28:28] <diverdude> thykka: mmm but how can i transfer the translations parameters between the 2 images?
[11:38:53] <diverdude> thykka: are you here?
[11:45:42] <Samian> Hi
[11:45:55] <robertmaxrees> goooood morning
[11:46:18] <Samian> Whats a good chanenl to ask about mediawiki vs xwiki? I don't know which one I should go with or whether to use something else. It's just for a team of 4 devs
[11:46:47] <robertmaxrees> i mean, there's a #webdev
[12:20:03] <diverdude> thykka: ok i think i managed: http://jsfiddle.net/2zhcvwpk/58/
[12:20:26] <taplar> lol
[12:20:35] <Samian> I'm looking for something like wiki or drupal that's more dev team management and note sharing. Just a place where I can share notes with my dev team
[12:21:04] <robertmaxrees> "wiki or drupal" - those are two very different things.
[12:21:31] <taplar> as far as note sharing, our team has a shared google docs folder we store stuff in
[12:21:36] <robertmaxrees> are you already using github?
[12:21:39] <Samian> note sharing and team diarty
[12:21:52] <Samian> *diary
[12:22:05] <robertmaxrees> github has a built-in wiki for projects.
[12:22:30] <Samian> yeah but I also want to do stuff like dates of when we visited a client and what we did on that date
[12:22:40] <robertmaxrees> you can do that via the gh wiki.
[12:22:59] <robertmaxrees> there's also confluence, which is decent if you're already using JIRA
[12:23:02] <taplar> or maybe some private gists?
[12:23:09] <Samian> well we don't use github. We use microsoft team services but their website is slow
[12:23:10] <diverdude> thykka: but for some reason it seems that the zoom image is not centered here the mouse is pointing. Do you know why?
[12:23:12] <robertmaxrees> ^ or a repo of notes./
[12:23:13] <Samian> slow and anoying
[12:24:45] <robertmaxrees> also, depending on your org, storing client notes next to dev stuff may or may not be the right thing to do.
[12:39:08] <diverdude> What is the correct way to do a transform where i both want to scale and translate? I am asking because I in this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/2zhcvwpk/66/   seem to somehow do it wrong such that the zoomed image is wrongly shifted....It should have its center where the mouse is pointing. (to see, hover mouse over lower image)
[12:39:51] <taplar> is Zoommable a jQuery plugin?
[12:40:17] <taplar> if not, this is a ##javascript question
[12:40:37] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:18:55] <JacquesLacan> Hey there.. is Comet still alive?
[13:19:26] <robertmaxrees> whatcha mean?
[13:20:48] <JacquesLacan> Long polling
[13:20:55] <JacquesLacan> I was looking forward to implement something like that
[13:21:05] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15966813/node-js-and-comet
[13:21:16] <JacquesLacan> Would like to make an AJAX request and have the server keep sending data to the browser..
[13:21:16] <robertmaxrees> long story short - don't use long polling.
[13:21:30] <JacquesLacan> I see...
[13:22:21] <taplar> web sockets are preferred
[13:22:24] <JacquesLacan> So WebSockets is the way to go
[13:22:31] <robertmaxrees> yar
[14:57:16] <jquery346> why is this simple math not working please? https://jsfiddle.net/8fgoz3je/1/
[14:57:35] <augz> anyone familiar with the datatable jquery library?
[15:00:12] <augz> jquery346, you should use the DateTime object
[15:00:54] <jquery346> im trying to calculate a time to my slider value
[15:01:00] <jquery346> math not checking out though
[15:03:15] <jquery346> the minutes seen to add to the end and no together
[15:03:46] <taplar> you didn't parse the minutes
[15:07:07] <augz> change line 4 to var value = (parseInt(hours) * 60 + parseInt(minutes));
[15:07:55] <jquery346> taplar: thank you again
[15:40:50] <taplar> you ever walk through a stupid spiderweb, and start singing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZktNItwexo
[15:41:07] <taplar> one of those days
[15:41:48] <robertmaxrees> i was hoping you were going to link to that song hahahaha
[15:44:54] <codecutter> Does window.opener.postMessage accept a regex as targetUrl option? i have several targetUrls (e.g. www.foo.com, foo.com, foo.co.uk. www.foo.co.uk), https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage
[15:45:57] <taplar> looks like it follows the patter of like the allowed origin header
[15:46:04] <taplar> it has to be either a static url or *
[15:46:17] <taplar> r/patter/pattern/
[15:49:41] <codecutter> can i see an example?
[15:50:17] <codecutter> does '*' opem up security issues?
[15:50:18] <taplar> that mdn page has an example or two
[15:50:21] <taplar> yeah
[15:50:26] <taplar> * goes every where
[15:50:33] <codecutter> so what the other option?
[15:50:55] <taplar> I would assume you could do two post messages.  one to foo.com and another to foo.co.uk
[15:51:06] <taplar> but you'd have to try it and see if it goes to all four locations
[15:51:47] <codecutter> is that the only way?
[15:51:55] <codecutter> can i use a regex?
[15:52:00] <taplar> not sure.  ##javascript might know more
[15:52:37] <taplar> if you only want it to go to the opener, you might could grab the opener window location and post the message to that
[15:53:23] <codecutter> and use '*' for the tagretUrl param?
[15:53:35] <taplar> no, you'd use the opener's window location
[15:53:59] <robertmaxrees> y'all talking about the targetOrigin?
[15:54:06] <taplar> yeah
[15:54:15] <codecutter> here what i'm doing now window.opener.postMessage({'value': true},'*');
[15:54:24] <codecutter> fo sho
[15:54:45] <robertmaxrees> yeah, no regex.  either '*' (which is a really bad idea) or a specific url.
[15:55:15] <codecutter> problem is i have more than one targeturl
[15:55:31] <robertmaxrees> then you need to have more than one target.
[15:55:41] <robertmaxrees> multiple postmessage calls
[15:56:15] <codecutter> thats the only other option?
[15:56:41] <robertmaxrees> honestly?  it's your only option if you care about end-user security at all :)
[15:56:52] <codecutter> aight
[15:56:56] <robertmaxrees> though i'd wonder why you're posting messages to multiple domains.
[15:57:17] <taplar> do you want it to go to multiple places, or do you want to "account" for multiple places?
[15:57:53] <codecutter> there is only one domain, but a user could type .co.uk, redirect to .com, but user could type foo.com instead of www.foo.com
[15:57:54] <taplar> because like i was saying, you might could just give it window.opener.location.domain as the targetOrigin
[15:58:05] <codecutter> hang on
[15:58:07] <codecutter> yikes
[15:58:16] <codecutter> .co.uk directs to .com
[15:58:35] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:58:38] <robertmaxrees> it redirects?
[15:58:56] <robertmaxrees> then you don';t need to account for .co.uk
[15:59:00] <codecutter> ok, never mind the .co.uk
[15:59:15] <robertmaxrees> so then a single .com is all you need to worry about.  problem solved.
[15:59:42] <codecutter> right
[16:00:09] <codecutter> now user could type either www.foo.com or http:://foo.com
[16:00:26] <taplar> iirc the domain for both should be foo.com
[16:00:29] <robertmaxrees> with or without www?
[16:00:35] <codecutter> yes
[16:00:45] <robertmaxrees> https://javascript.info/cross-window-communication#same-origin
[16:00:51] <robertmaxrees> see "Exclusion: subdomains may be same-origin"
[16:01:03] <codecutter> in this what value do i use as targeturl?
[16:01:13] <robertmaxrees> see the page i just linked :)
[16:02:45] <codecutter> foo.com, it is then
[16:42:45] <jquery346> is it possible to get ajax response from callback? http://jsfiddle.net/w3h6xgm7/
[16:44:52] <taplar> you mean the done? jquery346
[16:45:46] <jquery346> taplar: sorry i mean i want to get the results from the ajax request in the callback itself
[16:46:04] <taplar> which callback?
[16:46:27] <taplar> right now line 24-26 has a syntax error
[16:48:13] <jquery346> taplar: for instance in the done callback can i get the results of the ajax request ?
[16:49:05] <taplar> you should be able to, yes.  the done should function similar to the success callback
[16:50:42] <jquery346> ah ok thank you
[16:51:43] <codecutter> Uncaught ReferenceError: doucment is not defined https://pastebin.com/fXgMGMnu
[16:52:22] <taplar> typo
[17:32:40] <codecutter> graingert folks over at #nginx recommend enforcing www.* traffic
[17:33:18] <graingert> codecutter: you need to pick one or the other
[17:33:27] <codecutter> so how get the parent window to accept www.example.com and example.com?
[17:33:48] <codecutter> thats the only option?
[17:34:29] <taplar> the parent window only needs to accept whatever it's domain is
[17:35:17] <codecutter>  its either https://www.example.com or https://example.com
[17:35:36] <taplar> which you could grab off of the parent's location variable
[17:36:35] <taplar> go to your website that is going to open the popup, crack open the dev tools, and type: window.location
[17:36:40] <taplar> and see what all it has available to use
[17:36:40] <codecutter> Failed to execute 'postMessage' on 'DOMWindow': The target origin provided ('https://www.foo.com') does not match the recipient window's origin ('https://foo.com'). https://pastebin.com/3pDNxr7b

[17:38:39] <codecutter> tapler: Location {replace: ƒ, assign: ƒ, href: "https://example.com/secure", ancestorOrigins: DOMStringList, origin: "https://example.com", …}
[17:38:44] <codecutter> now?
[17:38:53] <taplar> so look at the origin parameter
[17:39:04] <taplar> that's what you need, no?
[17:39:19] <taplar> try the same thing on the www.example.com version
[17:41:07] <codecutter> tapler: but a user can also login with www.example.com, if I do then window.location gives me Location {replace: ƒ, assign: ƒ, href: "https://www.example.com/secure", ancestorOrigins: DOMStringList, origin: "https://www.example.com", …}
[17:41:26] <taplar> and the origin in that case has the www
[17:41:39] <taplar> which matches the version of the site that opened the popup, no?
[17:41:40] <codecutter> right
[17:41:47] <codecutter> err
[17:42:19] <taplar> so try using window.opener.location.origin for your targetOrigin
[17:42:56] <codecutter> yes
[17:44:15] <codecutter> ah
[17:44:25] <codecutter> i see the prob
[17:57:15] <graingert> codecutter: just setup the redirect
[17:57:35] <codecutter> sorted
[18:57:11] <Samian> hi
[18:57:16] <Samian> is there a jquery off topic channel?
[18:57:52] <Samian> #python has #python-offtopic. #perl has #perlcafe. #math has #not-math
[18:58:46] <robertmaxrees> i mean.
[18:58:47] <taplar> not that i'm aware of
[18:58:48] <robertmaxrees> #jquery :)
[18:59:02] <taplar> "off" topic
[18:59:05] <robertmaxrees> why do you ask?
[19:05:19] <Samian> I want to ask an offtopic question about what program you use for knowledge-idea sharing. Slack seems too chatty. MS Onenote is prone to merge conflicts when multiple people add to the doc at the same time. Wikis aren't good forquick note adding or keeping a diary of company meetings and summaries of each meeting
[23:48:16] <aFeijo> How can I convert "Wed, Apr 25th, 2018" string into Date ?
