[08:33:44] <codecutter> hover over larry page's name and notice how the popup appears, how do i do this with jquery? - https://plus.google.com/+LarryPage
[08:35:53] <codecutter> anyone?
[09:22:45] <codecutter> any suggestions?
[09:22:48] <codecutter> hover over larry page's name and notice how the popup appears, how do i do this with jquery? - https://plus.google.com/+LarryPage
[09:23:41] <Cork> codecutter: that's just an overlay
[09:23:59] <Cork> just add a position absolute element and populate it with the content you want
[09:24:12] <Cork> (and have the parent element be position: relative)
[09:37:53] <codecutter> Cork: can i see a jsfiddle?
[09:38:17] <Cork> i don't have time to construct one
[09:38:26] <codecutter> ok nvm
[09:38:32] <codecutter> are you refering to the popup?
[09:38:59] <codecutter> when you hover over the name, you see a popup, right?
[09:39:12] <Cork> popup, overlay ya
[09:48:17] <Cork> codecutter: this has no finess, but it shows the basics https://jsfiddle.net/fnL6zuqo/
[09:49:12] <codecutter> thanks
[10:02:17] <sine0> folks. the more websites i inspect and look at for inspiration the more I see using old versions of jquery such as jQuery v1.11.2. are there any reasons for not upgrading, is there a version split like python 2.7/3 or is it lighter to have the older version
[10:02:54] <sine0> I also understand that that could have been the version at the time of the site dev and so its not changed because there was no neee
[10:03:31] <Cork> sine0: 1.x 2.x and 3.x is not obsolete versions
[10:03:42] <Cork> it is different compatibility versions
[10:03:44] <sine0> I by neee I mean need, said in the voice of one of the worms from the origional dos game
[10:03:46] <Cork> all are supported
[10:04:12] <Cork> latest 1.x is 1.12.4, latest 2.x is 2.2.4 and latest 3.x is 3.2.1
[10:04:14] <sine0> ok, so why would I choose a certain version
[10:04:50] <Cork> 1.x has pre ie9 support, 2.x does not, 3.x is a rebase with some of the event structure rewritten, but it has the same browser support as 2.x
[10:05:22] <Cork> (read 3.x as plugin compatibility problem)
[10:05:41] <Cork> personally i've used 3.x for a long time, but i don't need old ie support
[10:06:09] <Cork> but note 1.11 is newer then 2.0
[10:07:08] <sine0> so there is no performance advantages of versions
[10:07:21] <Cork> sure there is
[10:07:37] <Cork> the compatibility in 1.x gives both performance cost, and feature cost
[10:07:54] <Cork> 3.x is a speed up towards 2.x (quite significant too)
[10:07:54] <sine0> ok
[10:08:13] <Cork> but if you need ie 8 support, the speed won't really matter :)
[10:08:46] <sine0> ok thanks for the helpful information
[10:08:52] <Cork> sine0: you can read through the history here http://blog.jquery.com/
[10:09:12] <Cork> the jquery release notes normally contain a lot of useful information
[10:09:37] <codecutter> Cork: trying to make it appear smoothly like yours https://pastebin.com/gdPjc1PY
[10:09:58] <sine0> I think the summary you gave me was enough for now thanks, I am a noob users still just using it to replace html element classes and little basics like that
[10:10:00] <Cork> codecutter: hide before appending and .show(<time>) after
[10:10:31] <codecutter> hide the 'htmlTemplate'>
[10:10:32] <codecutter> ?
[10:10:37] <codecutter> i tried that
[10:10:43] <Cork> codecutter: check the code i gave you
[10:10:51] <Cork> the .hide() and .show is in there
[10:16:44] <codecutter> Cork: https://pastebin.com/xS3dSzG5
[10:17:08] <Cork> codecutter: you're reparsing the html over and over again
[10:17:21] <Cork> parse it once, and use the dom
[10:17:37] <Cork> (aka. don't use html, use dom)
[10:35:52] <codecutter> Cork: high five
[10:35:54] <codecutter> thanks
[11:48:24] <z1haze> can do store a jquery object in a data property?
[11:48:46] <taplar> if you use data(), yes
[11:48:50] <z1haze> sweet
[12:43:49] <KnightsOfNi> Does anyone know how with datatables.net you can sort on a value that is different than the string presented in the column?
[12:44:15] <KnightsOfNi> I display dates as friendly format like '5 days ago' - but when sorting that column, it sorts by that string, rather than the actual timestamp

[13:23:57] <Joey__> is there a selector for the parent of the current element? (not function calls, but selector as string)
[13:24:55] <robertmaxrees> not that i've seen.
[13:24:57] <robertmaxrees> Joey__
[13:25:07] <robertmaxrees> why not use .parent()?>
[13:25:29] <Joey__> I need to pass in a data-target attribute
[13:26:17] <Joey__> so when an a element is clicked I will get the data-target to work with that, in this case it happens to be the parent
[13:26:36] <Joey__> so instead of giving it an id or name I rather have it select the parent if that is possible
[13:33:28] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused - you have a data-target that happens to be the parent of the clicked element?
[13:33:48] <robertmaxrees> 'cause you can use .parent() off any jquery selector.
[13:37:17] <Joey__> robertmaxrees that would narrow my javascript to dom where the item clicked is always the child of the target
[13:37:37] <Joey__> I want to make this a generic thing, so the item clicked has the selector of the target
[13:37:45] <Joey__> I used an id
[13:38:34] <robertmaxrees> i'm still way confused.
[13:38:35] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:38:49] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways to genericize those handlers and functions to give you what you want.
[13:54:35] <Joey__> it's ok, I did it with an id.... basically I have a "button" with a data-url and a data-target, when it is clicked I replace the data-target with the dom received from the url
[13:54:50] <Joey__> in this case I wanted the parent of the item to be replaced with the new dom
[13:55:09] <Joey__> but I can see a need to have a different item replaced
[13:56:07] <taplar> sounds like you're saying you want to do closest(...) where ... is the data-target
[14:01:54] <Joey__> taplar that makes it a parent / child relation again.... I don't want to have that relation in my javascript code

[17:10:28] <gambl0re> do you know red lobster?
[17:10:34] <robertmaxrees> YEP/.
[17:10:41] <poboy> haha
[17:10:41] <robertmaxrees> *yep.  pretty big chain duder.
[17:10:56] <robertmaxrees> neeetspliiiiit
[17:17:07] <robertmaxrees> well that was boring
[17:17:54] <taplar> i....i-i know red lobster, but i have some bad news for you
[17:18:06] <taplar> ........they're dead
[17:18:28] <robertmaxrees> you misspelled "bad"
[17:18:47] <taplar> lol
[17:19:09] <robertmaxrees> overpriced, rubbery seafood.
[17:19:19] <taplar> i tried a lobster pizza there once.  dunno if I didn't like the lobster, or i didn't like the join, but meh
[17:19:27] <taplar> *joint
[17:20:10] <taplar> i'm not much of a seafood guy, but I always say if I was, i wouldn't eat it unless i was in a coastal city at the time
[17:20:15] * MagnusVortex imagines a SQL query joining a lobster and a pizza together, with taplar in disgust
[17:20:25] <taplar> pretty much
[17:20:38] <taplar> mmmmm salty!
[17:21:03] <robertmaxrees> taplar bingo.  you CAN get decent seafood in some non-coastal areas, but the cooks at places like red lobster just don't know how to cook it.
[17:28:21] <gambl0re> robertmaxrees, where do you normally eat?
[17:28:39] <gambl0re> do you like chipotle?
[17:28:40] <robertmaxrees> lots of places.  i also cook a lot.
[17:28:50] <robertmaxrees> you're really concerned about my eating habits today lol
[17:29:10] <gambl0re> cause i remeber you told me like to eat sushi
[17:29:11] <taplar> wants to make sure you're getting enough kelp
[17:29:31] <robertmaxrees> taplar+
[17:29:35] <robertmaxrees> * taplar++
[17:29:39] <taplar> aka, the colon bomb
[17:35:35] <taplar> kelp makes me think it's a water version of polk salad
[17:37:17] <taplar> i typed that wrong.  *searches*
[17:37:34] <robertmaxrees> polk salad?
[17:38:16] <taplar> it's like this green grassy weed you can boil and eat, similar to spinach
[17:38:55] <robertmaxrees> OOOOOH - poke sallet
[17:39:02] <robertmaxrees> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytolacca_americana
[17:40:37] <taplar> i don't remember it being poisonous like that, but it seems similar.  used to eat that as a kid
[17:41:44] <grapheti> Just call it what it really is. Weed salad.
[17:42:03] <taplar> poor mans food!
[17:42:17] <grapheti> LOL
[17:46:55] <robertmaxrees> taplar did you eat it cooked?
[17:47:03] <taplar> yep
[17:47:05] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[17:47:12] <robertmaxrees> cooked pokeweed isn't toxic.
[17:47:44] <robertmaxrees> or at least isn't AS toxic.
[17:48:52] <taplar> how the world changes.  there i was as a kid eating toxic grass.  now kids are alergic to peanuts
[17:49:03] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:49:21] <robertmaxrees> i remember kids always being allergic to peanuts.
[17:49:23] <robertmaxrees> and latex.
[17:49:40] <robertmaxrees> i think we just started taking it seriously when epipens got so freakishly expensive.
[17:52:41] <taplar> probably.  i just remember it not being that big of a thing.  like, we'd eat pb&js and no one would ask anything.  now it's like if you even think about it, people ask first cause the chances that someone is allergic is at least culturally thought to be larger
[17:53:18] <taplar> from my point of view
[17:55:41] <taplar> though i do remember one girl in my class getting the whole allergies test done with the needles and turned out she was slightly alergic to a bunch of trees
[17:55:59] <jak2000> hi friends!!!!
[17:56:07] <taplar> and taplar
[17:57:26] <taplar> :'(
[17:59:23] * taplar liked jak1999 better.  he played along with my jokes
[18:00:00] <grapheti> I had a colleague allergic to chocolate. That has to be one of the worst allergies.
[18:00:12] <grapheti> welp
[18:00:24] <taplar> that would suck
[18:00:30] <grapheti> ikr
[18:00:46] <grapheti> She was over-dramatic imo about it too
[18:00:53] <taplar> though that reminded me that one of my teachers was allergic to that taste enhancer they put in all the food
[18:01:01] <taplar> NG .... something?
[18:01:39] <grapheti> like if she seen chocolate powder, she'd think she's gonna die or some shit
[18:01:45] <taplar> MSG
[18:01:56] <taplar> she was allergic to msg
[18:02:09] <grapheti> I dunno. lol
[18:02:29] <grapheti> ohhh
[18:02:30] <taplar> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosodium_glutamate
[18:02:38] <grapheti> you're saying your teacher was
[18:02:44] <taplar> yeah
[18:02:49] <grapheti> I ain't thinkin' today lol
[18:03:26] <grapheti> dam, naturally in cheese
[18:03:28] <grapheti> that'd suck too
[18:03:29] <taplar> and it's pretty heavily used in processed food and stuff
[18:05:34] <taplar> though, heh, that might have been a blessing for her.  no eating junk food
[18:07:25] <grapheti> yeah, that'd make you eat health shit for sure
[18:07:54] <grapheti> healthy*
[18:08:42] <grapheti> Did y'all hear about the outage?
[18:08:57] <taplar> no?
[18:09:20] <grapheti> https://twitter.com/Level3NOC/status/927633534424141824
[18:09:45] <grapheti> https://www.product-reviews.net/down/level3-internet-outage-status/
[18:10:13] <grapheti> Yahoo Mail, PSN, Xbox Live, Outlook, BT, Twitch, HBO Go, Craigslist, and other networks/services were down for an hour
[18:10:22] <grapheti> same as the amazon outage lol
[18:10:26] <taplar> huh
[18:10:49] <grapheti> It was a configuration error.
[18:10:54] <grapheti> that caused it
[18:11:09] <grapheti> You don't remember the amazon outage? lol
[18:11:13] <taplar> slightly bigger problem when you're dealing with part of the internet backbone it seems
[18:11:46] <grapheti> tru dat
[18:15:49] <grapheti> https://twitter.com/WelchBM/status/927645643899916289
[18:17:49] <taplar> wonder if someone got the axe over that
[18:18:39] <grapheti> Haha, yeah, dunno.
[18:18:53] <grapheti> I'm sure we'll get news articles about it tomorrow.
[18:20:14] <grapheti> bitcoin goin' down :O
[20:28:20] <hellyeah> can you suggest me plugin for table? That has sort feature also button for upgrading or removing row_?
[21:23:19] <nopea> when selecting an element by class, is it possible to use multiple classes to make sure you are drilled down to the right one?
[21:30:24] <hellyeah> you mean like go descendant child?
[21:31:44] <hellyeah> nopea,  thats for sure
[21:31:45] <nopea> hellyeah: yes.  For example, I am wrapping a couple of woocommerce divs (images & summary) into a new div.
[21:32:39] <nopea> but I want to make sure that the selected class are the right ones (just in case) so I was thinking $( '.woocommerce .images)
[21:34:26] <hellyeah> nopea,  does it give you an idea https://jsfiddle.net/4cbzrqow/
[21:34:44] <hellyeah> one button wont respond your click right
[21:34:59] <hellyeah> so i did multiple selection to get correct button
[21:35:19] <hellyeah> so you can walk down the tree like that
[21:35:52] <nopea> hellyeah: thanks!  I think I did get it right then.  It is working, just want to be sure that it is 'correct' way of doing it ;)
[21:36:43] <hellyeah> it is gonna be goode :) nice coding there
[21:37:04] <hellyeah> btw just for noticing you
[21:37:21] <hellyeah> you should cache your selection into variable
[21:37:31] <hellyeah> for avoiding walking tree over and over again
[21:37:48] <nopea> hellyeah: good idea.  Thanks for the tip
[21:38:05] <hellyeah> hope it helps have a good day
[21:41:51] <hellyeah> btw if you dont mind using es6
[21:42:01] <hellyeah> you  could use const/let
