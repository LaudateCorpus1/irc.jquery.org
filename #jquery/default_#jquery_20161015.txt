[00:58:37] <kmodo> hello guys, wondering if you can help me with a quick little function.  i'm working on this audio player here: https://kmodoio.github.io/wavesurfer-player.js/   if you find the #playlist element, it's set to overflow: scroll on the y axis
[00:59:18] <kmodo> so the button on the right hand side, if you click the last row for example (Thrystero) and the menu pops up it causes the window to scroll further
[00:59:37] <kmodo> i've got a function that is supposed to replace dropdown with drop up so the menu goes above the button
[00:59:49] <kmodo> https://github.com/kmodoio/wavesurfer-player.js/blob/master/docs/js/wavesurfer-player.js line 218 here
[01:00:16] <kmodo> but it only seems to work on mobile, and i'm assuming it's using the window height instead of my #playlist height, that's why it appears to be working on mobile but not regular browser
[01:07:03] <kmodo> updated the last js link it's line 16 now
[02:16:28] <santosh> Where do I start? I need to parse this XML: https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCv9NLo-EWE5go3XD3dME3Aw
[02:22:34] <santosh> Anybody on the channel?
[02:46:34] <muxer> no
[03:26:37] <santosh> What time should I come back?
[07:31:28] <codecutter> how do i get the file size?
[07:31:59] <codecutter> trying to set a limit on the max size of a file that can be uploaded from client side
[07:35:15] <drej> https://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/
[07:38:58] <codecutter> is that a plugin?
[07:39:10] <codecutter> prefer not to use a plugin
[07:40:37] <drej> it gives you tons of things to use, and its relatively light weight
[07:40:54] <drej> but you can also see how they do it if you want and just do that
[07:42:16] <codecutter> that will involve going over the source file line by line
[07:42:17] <codecutter> ...
[08:20:22] <momomo> if an element has text-align:center set from some parent.. is there an easy way to figure out what is actually centering the content? firebug forces me to traverse the dom and it's not an easy task to detect what is causing it.
[08:22:06] <shoky> momomo: in chrome you can easily see the css that is inherited from parents, donno about firefox but i'd assume it's possible there too
[08:22:34] <shoky> firebug is kinda obsolete i thought..
[08:23:44] <shoky> momomo: yeah firefox shows the inherited css
[09:14:05] <momomo> shoky, but it doesn't show it from what element, right?
[09:14:20] <momomo> actually it does
[09:15:11] <momomo> its just a big list
[09:54:15] <game0> guys, I'm trying to read the following response in jquery
[09:54:20] <game0> {"program_link":"HELP 3","program_version":"566","program_des":"DJFLAKS FKAJLSDA FAKJ;LJDA FKA;J"}
[09:54:33] <game0> can someone show me how?
[09:54:53] <game0> I tried some ways but it didn't work for me
[09:55:06] <d2k> Hello, I prepared a little pastebin: http://pastebin.com/hm8Rz8wu. Problem: I'm getting a very strange error message: " Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list " - it happens only on the mobile product detail page and only with a text output that contains something like this: " xy's (100 ml.) ". Note the "'", "()" and "100". I might have to mention that the parent code is php (Mobile Detect) and that I call a "<?php echo $h
[09:56:32] <d2k> sorry I allways forget about the chat length limit in here, never mind, please - gonna repost my question:
[09:57:10] <d2k> Hello, I prepared a little pastebin: http://pastebin.com/hm8Rz8wu. The error happens on line 4. Problem: I'm getting a very strange error message: " Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list " - it happens only on the mobile product detail page and only with a text output that contains something like this: " xy's (100 ml.) ".
[09:57:16] <d2k> Note the "'", "()" and "100". I might have to mention that the parent code is php (Mobile Detect) and that I call a "<?php echo $heading_title; ?>" inside the jquery function. Questions: Could one of the letters be the reason for that bug to happen or is it because of the PHP-string in it?
[09:57:21] <d2k> Is there a escape method I could use? Why it works fine along with other text outputs? Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.
[10:00:14] <d2k> I even tried something like: 		var div = $('.rightcol-page-desc'); 		div.html(div.text())	...without any result
[10:08:29] <game0> guys, this is the link to my page
[10:08:31] <game0> http://3334a6b3.ngrok.io/nader-final/admin.php
[10:08:50] <game0> I need to read the json response
[10:08:51] <game0> {"program_link":"HELP 3","program_version":"566","program_des":"DJFLAKS FKAJLSDA FAKJ;LJDA FKA;J"}
[10:09:06] <game0> each one in jquery
[10:10:19] <d2k> just one more info on my issue: My .tpl files encodig is set to UTF-8, Normalization Form: C with BOM signature included. Allways worked like that for me.
[10:15:20] <d2k> Here are three screenshots (one shows the correct behavior, the other two behave kinda different to each other): https://snag.gy/WfDdCA.jpg, https://snag.gy/ePmLYf.jpg, https://snag.gy/EQnu7v.jpg
[10:20:12] <shoky> d2k: as you can see in your 1st screenshot, the ' in your title closes the string you're passing to .prepend.   you'd need to escape it or not use such unsafe ways of builing js code. you shouldn't have php directives in your js
[10:29:46] <d2k> Dear shoky, big time thanks for the guidance. I get your point. Now I will try to figure out how to change those details you mentioned. I still wonder why screenshot #2 is affected by it, too. Not using the php directives would mean I need to smash my entire code for this particular .tpl file.
[10:32:15] <d2k> I will try the espace method first :) ...security might continue to suffer :(
[10:32:26] <shoky> d2k: the error in screenshot 2 is different, probably a different reason
[10:33:25] <d2k> shoky: I see, thanks for mentioning that! That helps a lot.
[10:33:45] <shoky> d2k: the error in #2 usually has to do something with a url that is responding with html instead of javascript code
[10:33:59] <shoky> happens also when trying to use JSONP wrongly
[10:34:18] <shoky> or could be html instead of json too i guess
[10:35:13] <d2k> it's for a overwrite of a facebook URL ...just for adding HTTPS instead of HTTP ...however the mobile version is not using that facebook code but it still gets loaded.
[10:35:51] <shoky> no idea, can't help much further with just a screenshot
[10:37:19] <d2k> You saved my day, shoky! I will let post a message if the escaping works ...cannot to much more at the moment.
[11:05:35] <d2k> got it: changed the code in line four to: jqnc('.maincontent').prepend("<h2 class=\"top-productname\">\'<?php echo $heading_title; ?>\'</h2>");
[11:06:29] <d2k> well, almost ;) ...still buggy
[11:07:01] <d2k> but it works - I'm very happy.
[11:07:56] <d2k> skoky: Thank you so much! Now trying to fix the wrong output of screenshot #2
[11:10:56] <shoky> d2k: you just changed the string to be with " instead of '
[11:11:04] <shoky> d2k: it will fail again if your title has " now
[11:11:21] <shoky> i meant that you need to escape the php string, not the surrounding js code
[11:11:52] <shoky> the ' or " (or both) inside the php string need to be escaped so they don't close the js string
[11:14:36] <d2k> shoky: I will follow your instructions, let's call it a temporal workaround. I will save your comment to a textfile for later revision. Have a very nice day!
[11:19:18] <d2k> shoky: I will use encodeURIComponent or something instead of a the escape thing but I did encodeURIComponent only once so far, sounds a bit tricky to me at the moment. :)
[11:43:00] <BulleTime> hey guys
[11:43:12] <BulleTime> anyone knows its possible to preload vimeo movies?
[11:43:33] <BulleTime> Im trying to avoid the black background when its loading
[12:00:43] <ploop> can anyone tell why these alerts seem to show up out of order? https://bpaste.net/raw/7e38f336fc8c
[12:07:52] <codecutter> Can this be simplified? $(event.currentTarget).parent().parent().parent().find('tr:first()').find('span:last()')
[12:19:37] <km4> hello guys
[12:46:23] <d2k> shoky: bug #2 was based on a missing height-value for the headline, simple CSS stuff :)
[12:47:55] <BulleTime> omg this channel has so manny split things damn
[12:48:36] <BulleTime> whats up jquery heroes today :P ?
[12:49:48] <BulleTime> ive got something to ask : is it common and/or possible to add html content (string) to a iframe with js ?
[12:54:44] <shoky> BulleTime: it's only possible if the iframe is on the same domain/origin. it's not very common no, and most places that do use it are not doing it for a good reason probably
[12:56:24] <BulleTime> shoky its for vimeo
[12:56:41] <shoky> same answer
[12:56:42] <BulleTime> getting vimeo player with ajax and put it in a iframe basically
[12:57:21] <BulleTime> but just to know, so i can set iframe.html(data) ?
[12:57:31] <shoky> how do you get it with ajax.. and why put it in an iframe if you already have it yourself
[12:57:38] <shoky> i already answered that..
[12:57:41] <BulleTime> well
[12:57:58] <BulleTime> i am trying to avoid the black background of the player
[12:58:19] <BulleTime> so im gonna replace the background color using ajax
[12:58:44] <shoky> what does ajax have to do with it
[12:58:45] <BulleTime> and then write the html to a container (that was an iframe)
[12:59:08] <shoky> anyway i doubt you can do it unless they have an option for you to do it
[12:59:14] <BulleTime> vimeo does not support another background rather than black
[12:59:29] <BulleTime> so
[12:59:54] <shoky> seems it does for pro members
[13:00:19] <BulleTime> for example see this link:
[13:00:20] <BulleTime> https://player.vimeo.com/video/186473224?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0
[13:00:28] <shoky> why?
[13:00:58] <BulleTime> im want to get this using ajax and put it inside a container as html
[13:01:16] <BulleTime> and then change some styles and stuff
[13:01:24] <shoky> that's not gonna work ;)
[13:01:59] <BulleTime> i think so
[13:02:12] <BulleTime> its just scraping the player and fix it
[13:02:32] <BulleTime> so
[13:02:34] <shoky> no not really
[13:02:38] <BulleTime> i dont think so about the pro
[13:02:41] <shoky> but enjoy
[13:02:53] <BulleTime> why not>\
[13:03:37] <BulleTime> pro memers with custom background colors anyway??
[13:03:41] <BulleTime> wtf
[13:04:18] <shoky> because they don't allow it, most likely
[13:05:22] <BulleTime> lol
[13:05:34] <BulleTime> i think i might be able to use the api then?
[13:06:41] <shoky> you're asking if you are able to use the api?
[13:35:00] <BulleTime> soky ive been looking around but, so can i change the background color with api?
[13:35:30] <BulleTime> ive been able to change some background colors in css inside the embed player source..
[13:35:44] <d2k> BulleTime: the only thing you could do with CSS and a iframe is: visibility:hidden !important;
[13:36:09] <d2k> BulleTime: Maybe by using :before and :after
[13:36:48] <BulleTime> d2k i dont know what u mean.. visibility:hidden to hide the bg color?
[13:37:03] <BulleTime> i dont use pesudo
[13:37:46] <BulleTime> pseudo*
[13:40:02] <d2k> BulleTime: Sorry, I just wanted to state that with CSS it's also almost impossible to mutate a iframe. There would be really good reasons (e.g. for the look of things) but we are not allowed to change a iframe content for security reasons.
[13:42:12] <BulleTime> d2k i know about iframe
[13:42:18] <BulleTime> but its not iframe specific
[13:42:40] <BulleTime> what about getting the iframe url and parse it with jquery?
[13:43:29] <BulleTime> i know its possible cause i did that before, but i rather like a better thing to fix the background color for vimeo
[13:57:20] <d2k> the class .player .video-wrapper could be simply changed to white or something if there would be access to the iframe.
[13:58:03] <BulleTime> d2k i know but as been said, iframe content cant be changed.. thats why i ask:)
[13:58:59] <BulleTime> just asking if its possible to change the bg with something, otherwise im gonna get it with ajax and change the html string
[14:00:00] <shoky> BulleTime you can't get that embed url with ajax because of same-origin policy. you'll get an error in the console when you try
[14:03:20] <d2k> BulleTime: You might excuse it to your client, some things are just too much. I love to tell to my clients: No, after all it's not possible, at least not on this planet :)
[14:04:17] <BulleTime> shoky i can get the html with a proxy..
[14:04:45] <BulleTime> d2k > on this planet < :P
[14:04:46] <shoky> right, that's not ajax
[14:05:19] <BulleTime> its a ajax call to my php with url param but yeah not 100% js
[14:05:29] <shoky> the request to the embed page is not ajax
[14:05:41] <shoky> doesn't matter how you access your own site obviously
[14:06:33] <BulleTime> shoky basically i get a url as html/string and then change it a bit
[14:06:42] <shoky> enjoy
[14:06:44] <d2k> BullTime You sure have interplanetary skills, I'm just from planet "mostly CSS".
[16:08:59] <superguest> I am having trouble installing jquery for use within nodejs
[16:09:00] <superguest> http://codepad.org/J2R50VAN
[16:09:43] <superguest> pointers leading me in the right direction are appreciated.
[16:16:18] <systemfault> The first thing you need to do when creating a project involving "npm" in any way is to create a package.json for it.
[16:16:37] <systemfault> You just need to do, inside the project directory: npm init          and follow the questions
[16:16:48] <systemfault> Then you'll stop having these warnings.
[16:17:35] <shoky> you might also want to try `npm uninstall -g jQuery`
[16:17:37] <systemfault> Also, when you install a package, you can save its name to the package.json file you created by doing     npm install <thepackagename> --save
[16:17:48] <systemfault> What shoky said too
[16:27:00] <superguest> okay.  I'll try that
[16:27:05] <superguest> thanks! ^^
[18:15:06] <carpii> Im using jquery to .append() a container div with other divs inside it. On all browsers this works fine, but in IE11 it only adds the container div.   Where do I begin troubleshotting this?  If I log the html its trying to append, and then append that manually, IE11 works fine.
[18:15:33] <shoky> make a jsfiddle showing the problem
[18:15:54] <carpii> yeah trying :) Its a single page app though, so hard to pin down just yet
[18:16:12] <shoky> well, that's how you begin troubleshooting this ;)
[18:16:17] <kmodo> Can someone help with a small function here: https://kmodoio.github.io/wavesurfer-player.js/  if you click one of the song menu buttons (icon on th e right) on mobile (dev tools or whatever)
[18:16:21] * carpii sobs
[18:16:23] <carpii> i know :)
[18:16:24] <kmodo> it is the funciton starting here: https://github.com/kmodoio/wavesurfer-player.js/blob/master/docs/js/wavesurfer-player.js on line 16
[18:16:47] <kmodo> when you click the top row, it opens the menu using dropup, instead of dropdown, and you can see that it's cut off by the container div
[18:16:57] <kmodo> but in the regular browser it works fine
[18:19:16] <carpii> kmodo how to reproduce this in chrome? Just using chrome devtools device emulation or?
[18:19:34] <kmodo> yeah thats' what does it for me
[18:19:48] <carpii> ok i see it
[18:19:52] <kmodo> honestly it works sometimes
[18:20:00] <kmodo> https://kobrien.me/music
[18:20:08] <kmodo> like i've done it on my own page here using the same code
[18:20:25] <kmodo> and works on "mobile" and regular, the dropdown functions normally and then drops up if it's toward the bottom
[18:20:56] <carpii> ok but dropping up isnt the problem, so much as it being clipped?
[18:20:59] <kmodo> but it looks like on the github example it's just automatically defaulting to drop up
[18:21:04] <carpii> or shouldnt it even drop up either?
[18:21:07] <kmodo> well it should be dropdown by default
[18:21:22] <kmodo> and ONLY drop up if it's going to be cut off by the overflow setting
[18:21:39] <kmodo> if i turn it off it'll drop down and then you have to scroll on the .playlist div to see the menu
[18:21:45] <kmodo> so in that case it shoudl drop up
[18:21:51] <carpii> its setting bottom: 100% which is causing the drop up
[18:21:58] <carpii> but removing that you still have same clipping issue
[18:22:03] <kmodo> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21232685/bootstrap-drop-down-menu-auto-dropup-according-to-screen-position this is where i found the solution
[19:10:18] <game0> hey community, I wanted to pass a value from jquery to sql command for database retrieve, how can I do this?
[19:10:31] <game0> is it possible
[19:11:37] <game0> like this " SELECT * FROM TBL WHERE 'TBL_NAME' = "+$TEST;
[19:12:50] <systemfault> Like that, it doesn't make sense.
[19:12:56] <systemfault> Do you use a server-side language?
[19:13:25] <game0> ok
[19:13:28] <game0> thanks
[19:17:45] <snover> if you write sql queries like that, you may look forward to a visit from bobby tables
[19:19:07] <game0> who's bobby tables
[19:19:09] <game0> ?
[19:19:11] <game0> hahaha

[19:51:05] <superguest> I need help setting up jquery in node
[19:51:17] <superguest> I've followed the instruction https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery
[19:52:14] <superguest> Here is a log of what I followed.
[19:52:16] <superguest> http://codepad.org/auzCQ3Jp
[19:53:33] <systemfault> superguest Your code must probably be between like 6 and 7
[19:53:39] <systemfault> Within the scope of jsdom
[19:54:51] <superguest> systemfault, what do you mean?
[19:55:23] <systemfault> See the function you pass to .env( ?
[19:55:36] <superguest> oh.. you mean it has to be after the "var $ = require ("jquery")(window);" line?
[19:55:42] <systemfault> Yes, I think so.
[19:55:59] <systemfault> But before });
[19:56:09] <systemfault> So, between line 6 and 7 :P
[19:56:59] <superguest> systemfault, man... that's clumsy.  I just want to test/learn/practice jquery in node
[19:57:12] <superguest> in a more natural REPL way
[19:58:32] <systemfault> Perhaps JSDom has something to make it nicer...
[19:59:36] <systemfault> Look at the "More examples" section on that page https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom
[20:00:00] <systemfault> The Creating a browser-like window object example might work for you
[20:00:05] <systemfault> "Creating a browser-like window object"
[20:01:10] <systemfault> Of course, you'd need to do a var $ = require('jquery')(window); after declaring window.... but it "might" work.
[20:04:14] <superguest> hope it does, starting a new node instance.
[20:07:40] <systemfault> Just tried it, works great.
[20:08:06] <superguest> -expletive-
[20:08:18] <superguest> it doesn't work on my machine.
[20:08:23] <systemfault> superguest: Used that code: https://jsfiddle.net/w4yt2hrr/
[20:08:26] <superguest> > $('<p>hello world</p>')
[20:08:26] <superguest> TypeError: $ is not a function
[20:08:40] <systemfault> Well.. if you have not declared it..
[20:08:48] <superguest> > var $ = require('jquery')(window);
[20:09:22] <systemfault> What is your code now?
[20:09:35] <systemfault> And have you installed "jsdom" and "jquery"
[20:10:50] <superguest> systemfault, bear with me for one sec... i am gon give this one more try. (starting over0
[20:10:57] <superguest> s/0/\)/
[20:12:48] <superguest> It fails at the "var x = $("<div>This is a test</div>");" line
[20:13:04] <superguest> and yes, I can confirm that both jsdom and jquery are installed. here is the log.
[20:13:59] <superguest> http://codepad.org/kLJqDd8m
[20:14:46] <systemfault> What is the full stack trace?
[20:14:53] <systemfault> Of the error
[20:15:03] <systemfault> Is it just TypeError: $ is not a function ?
[20:15:19] <superguest> there is a stack trace. one moment please :-)
[20:15:25] <systemfault> What is your current code?
[20:16:56] <superguest> this is the a log of me typing in your jsfiddle code, a line at a time:
[20:16:57] <superguest> superguest@DigitalRealm:~/Documents/nodejs$ nodejs

[20:17:39] <superguest> oops.
[20:17:43] <superguest> sorry.

[20:24:40] <superguest> systemfault, I wonder if I could "view"/"inspect" the current jQuery object, as a result of "var jQuery = require('jquery')(window);"
[20:25:07] <superguest> it says it is not a function, then I'd to know what da hell it currently is.
[20:25:45] <superguest> that way, I think some of you can better help me with my problem.
[20:26:49] <superguest> I think http://codepad.org/qJtHpMMy should shed some light
[20:29:27] <mechanist> hello everyone
[20:29:28] <mechanist> https://jsfiddle.net/679ehrqy/
[20:29:34] <mechanist> I need a script that hides the radio button menu when 'static mesh' is checked and the button 'Go' is clicked...
[20:36:09] <systemfault> superguest: I didn't know you were entering the script line by line...
[20:36:14] <systemfault> superguest: It doesn't work like that.
[20:36:30] <systemfault> Write the code inside a index.js file and do nodejs index.js
[20:37:44] <superguest> systemfault, http://codepad.org/qJtHpMMy should explain why "jQuery" is not a function
[20:38:45] <systemfault> It doesn't explain anything :/ Looks like jsdom and/or jquery doesn't work like that on the repl
[20:38:57] <systemfault> Using a .js file makes it work
[20:39:42] <superguest> I was looking for an interactive repl/environment where I can test/practice jQuery in node
[20:45:34] <systemfault> Perhaps it's just an option we need to enable on jsdom
[23:55:18] <rad> jQUEERyyyy hm
