[01:17:01] <jquery937> Hey guys, is there a way to create a unique ID based on date? I have a history i want to keep track of by date and using new Date().valueOf(); doesn't work because the value changes multiple times in a day
[01:18:02] <jquery937> I could break it down to a MMDDYY format, but checking to see if there are alternatives
[01:38:17] <bango> jquery937, can your id be a string? just make it a string of the timestamp... 01/13/2016-00:00:00
[01:40:05] <bango> readable timestamp, time seed, hash timestamp, there are options
[01:47:32] <Cork> jquery937: without external libs no, you can't
[01:47:53] <Cork> javascript doesn't have an equiv of strtime
[01:57:49] <Cork> jquery937: an option is to use https://github.com/abritinthebay/datejs

[05:47:18] <Cork> DevAntoine: make a jsfiddle and try to reproduce the problem
[05:47:33] <Cork> the only reason i can think of is elem isn't the same element
[05:47:57] <Cork> (or .on happens after .trigger)
[05:55:36] <hellyeah> anyone here work with datepicker?
[05:58:25] <hellyeah> why datepicker didnt work here?
[05:58:27] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/514/

[06:53:55] <Sarelle> DevAntoine: do you know jsfiddle?
[06:55:04] <DevAntoine> Sarelle: for that simple code I wanted to ask before to know if I missed something obvious
[06:55:28] <Sarelle> you should do that in fiddle and check the console
[06:55:37] <Sarelle> dont forget to use 'use strict'
[07:04:27] <lotuc> DevAntoine: Sorry, that's not right, i'm new to jquery :(

[08:14:33] <prohobo> be a batch append?
[08:14:38] <prohobo> *prepend
[08:15:46] <hellyeah> prohobo: i think you know jquery ui
[08:16:45] <prohobo> ?
[08:17:39] <hellyeah> you can create many element when you click create element. First elemet has datepicker thing but when you create the others. datepicker dont work for other. How can i fix that?   http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/516/
[08:20:07] <DevAntoine> how can I retrieve the array passed to the .trigger()? https://jsfiddle.net/no75q34u/1/
[08:23:44] <DevAntoine> wow, I have to wrap the array inside an object?! oO
[08:26:49] <DevAntoine> oh, I see, I need to have x params in the event handler when I send an array of x items
[08:26:57] <DevAntoine> otherwise I pass the array inside the object
[08:30:28] <prohobo> no idea hellyeah
[08:30:46] * hellyeah prohobo is funny nickname
[08:39:10] <shoky> hellyeah  http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/517/
[08:40:24] <hellyeah> what did you do examtly
[08:40:28] <hellyeah> exactly?
[08:40:50] <shoky> changed the top function
[08:41:34] <shoky> you kept adding a clone with the same ID as before, and you were looking for #from and #to  but ID's must be unique
[08:42:37] <shoky> sorry i meant you were looking for  .from  and .to  instead of only the current .from and .to
[08:43:23] <hellyeah> ah
[08:43:24] <hellyeah> find
[08:43:41] <shoky> find, and using a var for the clone
[08:43:42] <hellyeah> you use fine function to find current .from and .to right
[08:43:46] <shoky> so you can keep doing stuff to it
[08:43:54] <shoky> and not have to re-query the DOM for it
[08:44:23] <hellyeah> why you remove id
[08:44:31] <shoky> because id's must be unique
[08:44:52] <hellyeah> but there is no id there
[08:44:53] <shoky> and because you don't want the clone to have that same id... because you are selecting for that id the top line
[08:44:56] <shoky> yes, there is
[08:44:59] <hellyeah> except datepickerPart
[08:45:07] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:45:14] <shoky> right, that's an id..
[08:45:27] <shoky> you only want the hidden div on top to have that id, not the clones
[08:46:01] <hellyeah> hmm so first you chose datepicker and clone it
[08:46:17] <hellyeah> second you remove that id for making it unique each time when i create new
[08:46:38] <shoky> yes there are 2 reasons here for removing the id
[08:46:43] <hellyeah> then you find current .from and .to for applying datepicker
[08:46:46] <shoky> id's must be unique, period
[08:46:51] <hellyeah> am i correct s farr?
[08:46:54] <shoky> yes
[08:47:06] <hellyeah> is there anything i missed here?
[08:47:35] <shoky> not really.. just the append/removeClass  but you already did that fine
[08:47:59] <shoky> now go fix the bottom function on your own ;p  figure out what you want it to do first :)
[08:48:25] <hellyeah> you nean get between dates?
[08:48:33] <shoky> ye
[08:49:05] <taplar> should the top one be one() instead of on()?  otherwise it could execute multiple times
[08:49:12] <hellyeah> but guess you understand what i try to do right?
[08:49:22] <shoky> taplar mm i think he wants it multiple times
[08:49:26] <taplar> k
[08:49:30] <hellyeah> one
[08:49:48] <hellyeah> line 1?
[08:49:50] <shoky> hellyeah: not with the getBetween i donno what you wanna do there.. because there can be 10 different lines with datepickers
[08:50:02] <hellyeah> well
[08:50:39] <hellyeah> check this example
[08:50:41] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/3/
[08:50:53] <hellyeah> i try to do it for multiple
[08:51:05] <shoky> this example only has one line, yes
[08:51:07] <hellyeah> when you pick date . from and .to you get dates between
[08:51:14] <shoky> that's why i dont know what you wanna do, because you don't have only one line P
[08:51:23] <hellyeah> well
[08:51:25] <shoky> but anyway i don't need to know what you wanna do
[08:51:29] <shoky> you need to know :)
[08:51:36] <hellyeah> i wrote that but i just transform it into muşltiple
[08:51:45] <hellyeah> i will tell
[08:51:51] <hellyeah> i will have arrays of array
[08:51:58] <shoky> just go do it
[08:52:03] <jomofcw> Hello !
[08:52:05] <hellyeah> those arrasy of array will have dates in each index
[08:52:11] <taplar> jomofcw:hola
[08:52:42] <hellyeah> [[1,2,3,4,5],[11,12,13],[23,24,25]] smt like that
[08:52:55] <hellyeah> think number as date
[08:54:09] <jomofcw> I submit a form using AJAX. in the target of the action, a PHP script is executed. Two thing can happen in it : some field contain error then I send the HTML with the list of the error, or no error detected and I redirect to another URL. Is there a way, using jQuery AJAX, to detect that a redirection occurs ?
[08:54:38] <Cork> jomofcw: no
[08:54:46] <Cork> redirect is handled by the browser
[08:54:51] <Cork> js never knows about it
[08:54:53] <jomofcw> Hello Cork ^^.
[08:54:56] <hellyeah> let me try it out
[08:55:06] <Cork> jomofcw: the simplest solution is to not return html, but json
[08:55:07] <jomofcw> Hm that's what I was affraid about :/.
[08:55:25] <taplar> actually in the error case he should return an error http code
[08:55:28] <Cork> alternatively you can set a custom header indication the redirect
[08:55:36] <jomofcw> Cork and so in the JSON i can specify the type of the data I return, is that the idea ?
[08:55:36] <taplar> then if he doesn't get that he can assume a redirect happened
[08:55:51] <taplar> if those are the only two possible cases
[08:56:04] <Cork> jomofcw: { location: '/dlkfjsdlf/', html: '', errors: [], ... }
[08:56:53] <Cork> taplar: the http error depends
[08:57:07] <Cork> you can't really use a meaningful http error code if the form has multiple fields
[08:57:18] <jomofcw> Cork hm OK... that's a good idea. Just a question about the header thing : is that dangerous to add custom header ?
[08:57:34] <Cork> jomofcw: not really, but make sure you prefix it with X-
[08:57:52] <jomofcw> yup. OK, thanks for your help Cork and taplar :D.
[08:57:57] <Cork> X- is to identify that it isn't standard
[08:58:03] <taplar> it wouldn't have to be specific to each field. just a generic something went wrong error
[08:58:21] <Cork> taplar: ya, but that is abusing the http status code
[08:58:21] <taplar> *code
[08:59:27] <hellyeah> brb
[09:03:47] <jomofcw> In my caseI cant use the JSON solution (because I can't reformat ALL the whole thing of the structure I use - but I will do it in my next projects) so I will use the header one.
[09:04:13] <Cork> jomofcw: you don't really need to
[09:04:33] <Cork> you can just put the result into a string and json_encode it
[09:04:50] <Cork> so just the point that actually sends the result has to care
[09:12:00] <jomofcw> Cork OK I understand.
[09:12:37] <Cork> jomofcw: but ya the custom header is another valid solution
[09:12:47] <Cork> i use it to update pushState
[09:24:07] <hellyeah> hey there
[09:25:03] <taplar> sup
[09:25:28] <hellyeah> not much
[09:25:34] <hellyeah> what about you taplar
[09:25:47] <taplar> refactoring like a mutha.
[09:26:19] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:26:30] <hellyeah> mutha means i check motherfucker
[09:26:34] <hellyeah> is that corrent ?
[09:26:36] <hellyeah> :S
[09:26:38] <taplar> lol, yes
[09:26:49] <hellyeah> eheha
[09:27:00] <hellyeah> whose code you refactor
[09:27:02] <hellyeah> ?
[09:27:16] <taplar> one of the projects my team is responsible for
[09:27:39] <hellyeah> i have a question btw you can create element but when i check dom ic empty div class why is that? http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/521/
[09:27:53] <taplar> how are you checking the dom?
[09:27:53] <hellyeah> taplar: sounds like you are tech stack
[09:28:04] <taplar> just a normal programmer
[09:28:11] <hellyeah> well i console element
[09:28:17] <taplar> k
[09:28:20] <hellyeah> and i checked on the console tag
[09:29:00] <taplar> doesn't look empty to me
[09:29:12] <taplar> i clicked the create and then the get between button
[09:29:44] <taplar> in case you missed it, there is a little arrow on the left hand side of it (at least in chrome) that expands it.
[09:30:09] <hellyeah> <div class>
[09:30:13] <hellyeah> you didnt see that
[09:30:29] <hellyeah> i mean sorry for meantioning wrong
[09:30:29] <taplar> yep i saw that and it has an expandable arrow on the left hand side
[09:30:34] <hellyeah> ic <div class>
[09:31:46] <taplar> here, if you want to see it as a string: http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/522/
[09:31:57] <hellyeah> http://dpaste.com/0J6YN0N
[09:32:03] <hellyeah> div class=""
[09:32:12] <hellyeah> i dont understand what this created
[09:32:45] <taplar> the code it taking off the hidden class.  it apparently is leaving the attribute though
[09:32:46] <hellyeah> i copied and pasted to dpaste
[09:32:58] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:33:04] <taplar> doesn't hurt anything
[09:33:54] <hellyeah> ic
[09:34:51] <hellyeah> it returnsd zero http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/523/ that sohuld return 2? Because there is two elements.
[09:35:23] <taplar> nope
[09:35:27] <taplar> it's an index dude
[09:35:56] <taplar> why would it be 2?
[09:36:22] <hellyeah> i mean
[09:36:27] <hellyeah> sorry 0,1
[09:36:34] <hellyeah> damn
[09:36:45] <hellyeah> sorry i c that
[09:41:56] <hellyeah> my aim is to get each .from and .to seperately when you create two element i see 0,1,2 but now i see 0,1,2 that means there is three elements but there are just two http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/529/
[09:42:05] <hellyeah> is that false?
[09:44:23] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:44:38] <hellyeah> i guess it also counts the element i did hide
[09:45:22] <taplar> looks like it
[09:45:36] <hellyeah> it is okey now i fixed it
[09:46:03] <hellyeah> taplar: my aim is to get all dates you selected and date in between into arrays of array
[09:46:31] <hellyeah> i will have one more calendar that is not related with datepickers
[09:47:11] <hellyeah> when someone pick start date and end date i will disable dates in other calendar too report use those dates is already selected
[09:47:22] <hellyeah> hope you understand what i intend
[09:47:47] <taplar> kinda
[09:48:07] <taplar> question
[09:48:22] <taplar> is the entire purpose of generating the days between to do that check?
[09:48:26] <hellyeah> can you check here http://jsfiddle.net/xgmmffm5/38/
[09:49:15] <hellyeah> taplar: yes
[09:49:28] <hellyeah> like you pick 11/12/... and 16/12/..
[09:49:31] <taplar> why not simply check the other start and end dates against each other?
[09:49:39] <hellyeah> you need to have 11,12,13,14,15,26
[09:49:43] <hellyeah> you need to have 11,12,13,14,15,16
[09:50:02] <hellyeah> taplar: this is also what i need to do
[09:50:22] <hellyeah> but now i need not related calendar on a page like other element
[09:50:27] <jomofcw> To change the value of a radio button is that better to do .attr('checked',true) or .trigger('click'), or somthing else ?
[09:50:32] <hellyeah> they will be top of the page
[09:50:45] <taplar> jomofcw:iirc you can just set the value
[09:50:53] <hellyeah> and when you select dates and click submit the dates in this calendar will be disabled
[09:52:17] <hellyeah> taplar: may be i should tell you late about this
[09:56:16] <hellyeah> taplar: did you ever try this http://www.freecodecamp.com/
[09:56:39] <taplar> never heard of that
[09:58:05] <hellyeah> actually what i need is to create a time for following decent tutorial about jquery
[09:58:18] <hellyeah> i am not bad i am not good i am in the middle
[09:58:28] <hellyeah> but defitiely i have to cultivate my skills
[10:04:00] <Kev-> I'm using ICanHaz (mustache wrapper) and am having some troubles iterating... Template is displayed, but <ul>{{#.}}<li>{{name}}</li>{{/.}}</ul> Returns nothing. data is [{name:'foo'}] for example and won't work... Always empty no matter what I try...
[10:07:20] <Cork> Kev-: not sure mustache supports getting an array and looping that
[10:07:32] <Cork> you might have to wrap the array in an object and use the name you gave it
[10:07:48] <Kev-> I tried {foo: data} and {{#foo}}
[10:08:06] <Kev-> i.e. putting the array in an object and passing that to the template
[10:08:17] <Cork> hmm, not sure then
[10:08:20] <Cork> that i know works...
[10:08:26] <Kev-> I'm probably missing something basic, I've just been wrestling this for a couple of days now on and off and can't get it to work
[10:08:50] <Cork> might want to ask in a channel more oriented at the template engine
[10:09:20] <Cork> Kev-: => #{
[10:09:23] <Cork> try asking there
[10:09:36] <Kev-> Thank you, I'll try that :)
[10:10:00] <selrond> anybody here?
[10:12:32] <Kev-> Mysteriously it just started working. And I'm not sure I changed anything.
[10:12:40] <Kev-> I'll take it anyway.
[10:12:53] <Cork> might have been a cache thing
[10:13:50] <Kev-> I've banged my head against this problem for several days now... on and off
[10:13:57] <Kev-> If it works it works, great :)
[10:14:05] <taplar> doesn't sound healthy
[10:14:29] <Kev-> A lot of things aren't :)
[10:22:58] <Mark____> does anyone here know if there’s anyway i can install some sort of BGM player for music on my webpage? i don’t know if there is such. there used to be tons of BMG player that’s made with either php or anything else back in 2000.
[10:24:42] <Cork> Mark____: you could try https://cyberagent.github.io/boombox.js/
[10:29:03] <Mark____> but how do i keep it playing even when i moveon to other page?
[10:29:24] <Cork> Mark____: you can't really do that
[10:29:29] <Mark____> yeah. that’s the problem.
[10:29:31] <Cork> you would have to not unload the current page
[10:29:41] <Cork> and instead ajax load the new content into the current page
[10:30:06] <Mark____> hmm, but do you think it’s possble though?
[10:30:07] <Mark____> at all?
[10:30:22] <Kev-> sure
[10:30:23] <Mark____> hmm i see.
[10:30:27] <Kev-> Just don't reload :)
[10:30:30] <Mark____> ajax load content… sigh
[10:31:04] <Cork> Mark____: what i just told you is doable ya
[10:31:40] <Mark____> what, you just told me i can’t refresh the page, that’s not doable?
[10:32:06] <Mark____> i can’t believe that there’s not a single bgm player that actualy works like magic.
[10:32:44] <Cork> Mark____: "instead ajax load the new content into the current page"
[10:33:02] <Mark____> yeah, while keeping the bgm player on the current page.
[10:33:07] <Mark____> that’s not really the solution.
[10:33:32] <Cork> meaning do something like $.ajax().done(function(data) { $('main').html(data.html); navigation.pushState("", {}, data.location); })
[10:33:52] <Cork> Mark____: well it kinda is
[10:34:07] <Cork> the only other option would be to open a popup
[10:34:09] <arup_r> How can I add `disabled` attribute ? for eg. what should be in `?` -> $( "#greatphoto" ).attr( "disabled", ?? );
[10:34:19] <Cork> arup_r: don't use .attr
[10:34:24] <Cork> you don't want to set an attribute
[10:34:27] <Mark____> then i’ll i have to set every single link as a jquery javascript no?
[10:34:29] <Cork> you want to change a property
[10:34:37] <Cork> so .prop('disabled', true/false)
[10:34:43] <arup_r> ok. Cork
[10:35:34] <Cork> Mark____: no $(document).on('click', 'a', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); $.ajax(this.href) });
[10:35:51] <Mark____> okay, i ‘ll try it and tell you if that works.
[10:37:48] <Mark____> for some reason it’s not loading the link
[10:38:04] <Mark____> sec
[10:39:06] <Cork> Mark____: you have to structure the pages to work with that
[10:39:11] <Mark____> yeah. it’s not working.
[10:39:14] <Mark____> what do you mean?
[10:39:14] <Cork> you can't just add that line and "it works"
[10:39:28] <Cork> the server needs to send a json object instead of the full page
[10:39:30] <Mark____> i totally thought that one line would work.
[10:39:35] <Cork> so you get the data you need to do the js work
[10:39:48] <Cork> i've given you several partials
[10:40:01] <Cork> you need to figure out what the small examples means and code the site to work with it
[10:40:26] <Mark____> um, i’ve used jquery post and load before,
[10:40:34] <Mark____> so i thought that one line would fix everything.
[10:41:02] <Mark____> it replaces current html with the content of the link no?
[10:41:12] <Mark____> or maybe im not reading the script well.
[10:53:37] <islalobo> Hello, I'm trying to submit a form with ajax and I'm getting a 500 internal error and I'm not seeing why. This is the ajax submit: http://kopy.io/oI1Ie
[10:59:31] <taplar> what happens if you go to the url in your browser
[11:05:36] <islalobo> taplar: it's a page
[11:06:06] <islalobo> I have the action url for that form defined as the specified url
[11:10:06] <islalobo> I actually have it working now :)
[11:10:19] <islalobo> Just need to get access and display the errors when it fails
[11:16:53] <PCatinean> Hey guys
[11:17:23] <PCatinean> Does anyone have any idea why a Jquery Ui Datepicker would not work and make the field disabled on  computer with Windows XP but with the latest firefox downloaded?
[11:17:36] <PCatinean> I do not have access to the computer so far but I wanted to know if anyone knew off the top of their head
[11:17:55] <PCatinean> I can't think of anything is the latest firefox is installed and it works for me on Ubuntu and a friend on Windows
[11:20:12] <Mark____> im trying to load hyperlinks wihtout refreshing the page using ajax load. would this work? https://jsfiddle.net/23cgzvk5/
[11:21:46] <taplar> is the page response a page fragment and not a complete page?
[11:22:45] <Mark____> it’s a complete page
[11:22:49] <Mark____> replacing the current one.
[11:23:11] <taplar> then I don't believe that would be a proper use
[11:23:21] <taplar> you would have a nested html page inside a body tag
[11:23:45] <Mark____> hmm, the thing is that, i have  a music player that plays music and i cannot afford refreshing the page or loading a new one.
[11:23:49] <Mark____> any better solution?
[11:23:52] <akkufomk> lol taplar I thought you said something like put your html inside a body bag
[11:24:00] <akkufomk> I'm like hell yah
[11:24:08] <taplar> lol, do NOT
[11:24:23] <Mark____> lol.
[11:24:35] * akkufomk needs to drink some coffee
[11:28:45] <arc_> you should try something called shockwave flash
[11:29:56] <Mark____> urg flash.
[11:31:34] <taplar_meeting> slightly here while in a meeting
[11:31:56] <taplar_meeting> something else to note.  your trying to avoid a page refresh.  but your trying to completely replace a page...
[11:32:23] <taplar_meeting> so i'm not sure what 'refresh' your trying to avoid
[11:47:22] <arc_> taplar_meeting he just wants the music to keep playing between page changes
[11:49:43] <ABM_Dan> Is there a way to run $.param on two objects without modifying them?
[11:49:57] <ABM_Dan> I tried $.extend but it ended up altering one of the two.
[11:53:29] <shoky> ABM_Dan: hm? $.param doesn't modify anything
[11:53:39] <ABM_Dan> but $.extend does
[11:53:47] <ABM_Dan> and $.param doesn't take multiple variable
[11:54:09] <ABM_Dan> I think I might end up doing $.extend({}, obj1, obj2);
[11:54:09] <shoky> what do you want to do..?
[11:54:21] <shoky> that's a common way to use $.extend yea
[11:56:30] <ABM_Dan> https://gist.github.com/ABM-Dan/060bc7a1b041a63c871e
[11:57:43] <shoky> that code doesn't make sense.. $.param returns a string, not an object..
[11:57:46] <ABM_Dan> need to move that param call down.
[11:58:01] <ABM_Dan> yeah line 4 needs to be like line 16.
[11:58:16] <shoky> yea. so yea just add the {} as first param to $.extend
[11:58:28] <ABM_Dan> updated.
[11:58:47] <ABM_Dan> I am using a new object now so it shouldn't be required here.
[11:59:01] <shoky> right
[12:00:01] <ABM_Dan> $.param($.extend({}, query['parameters'], query['filters']))
[12:00:12] <ABM_Dan> This is what I am putting in the data attribute of an ajax call.
[12:00:19] <ABM_Dan> And I think it should probably work.
[12:01:55] <shoky> yep.. though specifically for jquery's ajax you don't need to call $.param yourself
[12:02:08] <ABM_Dan> Uh. Interesting.
[12:03:03] <ABM_Dan> Thanks for the assist man, much appreciated.
[12:03:14] <shoky> np
[12:06:48] <claytonzaugg> Is there a way to change the position of children tags? For example <div><img><p>foo</p></div> ---> <div><p>foo</p><img></div>
[12:07:16] <ABM_Dan> you can append->remove the img
[12:08:31] <claytonzaugg> is there a way to just swap them or move image below the <p> tag instead of removing it then rebuilding it again?
[12:08:56] <shoky> claytonzaugg:  $('img').insertAfter('p')
[12:09:37] <claytonzaugg> shoky, Thank you!
[12:09:38] <shoky> or  $('img').prependTo('div')
[12:09:43] <shoky> or tons of other such ways ;p
[12:09:53] <claytonzaugg> perfect, didn't know what syntax to start looking for
[12:09:54] <shoky> sorry meant appendTo
[12:10:14] <taplar> any of those won't do a rebuild.  your selecting an existing element and simply moving it
[12:10:26] <shoky> that's what he asked for ;p
[12:10:42] <taplar> ya, i was thinking he might think some were doing a rebuild
[12:11:00] <claytonzaugg> no rebuild required, just repositioning after the dom loads
[12:12:24] <taplar> mmm, chilli mac day in the bistro.
[12:17:56] <taplar_food> it's like crack
[12:21:13] <hassoon> d'oh
[12:25:36] <hassoon> why desn't this couple of instructions    $("#"+tr_id).css("border",'3px solid blue'); $("#"+tr_id).delay(1000).html(result).css("border",'');   make the tr element referenced by the id tr_id, a) have a blue border, b) get another content (being the variable result) ,c) gets its border reset.
[12:25:47] <hassoon> both b) and c) after 1s
[12:25:52] <hassoon> why doesn't *
[12:28:45] <taplar_food> stupid network
[12:29:10] <taplar_food> i'm not sure delay() works like that.  iirc it's expected to follow like an animate() or something else that does something over time
[12:29:38] <taplar_food> it's not a replacement for setTimeout
[12:53:51] <hassoon> do i have to write functions like .css() or .html() i na certain format when used with delegated elements? i mean those elements added later using some dynamic ajax calls
[12:53:56] <hassoon> *in a *
[12:54:13] <taplar_food> what are you trying to do?
[12:54:28] <taplar> you can only set css and html on existing elements
[12:55:18] <taplar> existing being already in the dom or as a fragment you have access to
[13:27:12] <jquerynoob> hello beautiful people
[13:27:16] <jquerynoob> i need help with jquery
[13:27:33] <taplar> he starts with compliments.  this is new
[13:27:43] <taplar> sup?
[13:28:37] <snowman44> haha
[13:29:13] <jquerynoob> here is my code: https://jsfiddle.net/19kt8mc7/
[13:29:32] <jquerynoob> basically i would like to write something that keeps track of your balances
[13:30:07] <jquerynoob> right now i would like to implement the feature where you just iterate through every item in that modal window and see if it's empty
[13:31:22] <jquerynoob> if it's empty highlight the fields in red and if it isn't append that data to the table and close the modal window
[13:32:14] <taplar> first off, don't put a complete page in a jsfiddle.  use the external resources
[13:32:15] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/19kt8mc7/1/
[13:32:37] <jquerynoob> it's my first time doing this, sorry :(
[13:32:42] <taplar> it's cool
[13:32:53] <robertmaxrees> also: math in JS is a scary idea - be really careful.
[13:33:39] <jquerynoob> i'm only learning here
[13:33:51] <jquerynoob> this won't be deployed
[13:34:02] <robertmaxrees> it's a good thing to learn then ;)
[13:34:13] <jquerynoob> and i would love to learn how scary it is ;)
[13:34:15] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/ft1w5zhg/
[13:34:56] <snowman44> Anybody ever work or look into the Objective C bridge for JS?
[13:35:22] <robertmaxrees> snowman44 you'll probably have better luck in ##javascript.
[13:36:00] <snowman44> You think? :D I asked there already, nobody seem to care :(
[13:36:20] <taplar> jquerynoob: https://jsfiddle.net/19kt8mc7/2/  cleaned up the scripting a little
[13:36:26] <taplar> so, what was the question again?
[13:36:42] <robertmaxrees> snowman44 this channel is the support hub for jquery so you're not likely to get much interest in that.
[13:37:11] <jquerynoob> taplar: basically i want for now to just make sure that the submit button checks if the fields are empty
[13:37:23] <taplar> which fields?
[13:37:26] <jquerynoob> if they are use css to highlight the fields and
[13:37:29] <jquerynoob> the fields in the model window
[13:37:43] <jquerynoob> when you click new transaction a wild popup appears
[13:37:45] <taplar> ah, ok
[13:37:51] <taplar> so what have you tried?
[13:38:04] <snowman44> robertmaxrees yeah I understand
[13:38:06] <jquerynoob> i don't know what to try to be honest
[13:38:25] <robertmaxrees> jquerynoob it's called an "event listener" :)
[13:38:38] <jquerynoob> okay
[13:39:00] <jquerynoob> robertmaxrees: i do have that
[13:39:07] <jquerynoob> $('#submit_button').on('click', checkField); });
[13:39:08] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/ is a good resource - http://learn.jquery.com/events/ especially.
[13:39:30] <jquerynoob> i'm having trouble with this function
[13:39:31] <jquerynoob> function checkField() {   $('#apply-form input').blur(function() {     if(!this.value) {       $(this).parents('p').addClass('warning');     }   }); }
[13:39:39] <robertmaxrees> aaaah so unreadable.
[13:39:46] <taplar> ok, so one thing right off
[13:39:56] <taplar> that blur, iirc, is a binding
[13:40:04] <jquerynoob> what does that mean?
[13:40:08] <robertmaxrees> .blur() is an event binding, yeah
[13:40:15] <robertmaxrees> you don't want that in checkField
[13:40:18] <taplar> it means your telling the logic what to do *when* blur happens
[13:40:27] <taplar> and, your doing that every time that function runs
[13:40:29] <jquerynoob> ???
[13:40:43] <robertmaxrees> every time you run checkField, you're binding a listener.
[13:40:46] <robertmaxrees> not running that code.
[13:40:52] <jquerynoob> oh thanks
[13:40:57] <taplar> blur(function...) is like click(function...)
[13:41:13] <jquerynoob> so what should i do instead?
[13:41:30] <robertmaxrees> don't put that in a funtion :)
[13:41:47] <taplar> *repeated
[13:42:04] <robertmaxrees> remove function checkField() { } from around it.  you don't need it.
[13:43:19] <jquerynoob> what do i do to check the field?
[13:43:27] <jquerynoob> check each field
[13:43:33] <taplar> first, which fields?
[13:43:46] <jquerynoob> the ones that appear when you click new transaction
[13:43:52] <taplar> how do you identify them?
[13:44:05] <taplar> cause you gotta look them up
[13:44:17] <jquerynoob> one is called money
[13:44:28] <taplar> id, name, class?
[13:44:28] <robertmaxrees> (i think he means selectors)
[13:45:05] <jquerynoob> id money, id input_date, id send, id receive
[13:45:13] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:45:18] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to fix that.
[13:45:20] <jquerynoob> all of those
[13:45:21] <jquerynoob> why?
[13:45:24] <robertmaxrees> you can't have mutliple elements with the same ID.
[13:45:34] <robertmaxrees> if you're going to add rows with those elements, things won't work right.
[13:45:35] <jquerynoob> they have a different id
[13:45:43] <jquerynoob> oh
[13:45:49] <jquerynoob> what should i do?
[13:45:52] <robertmaxrees> use classes.
[13:45:53] <jquerynoob> class?
[13:46:08] <jquerynoob> okay i will use a class
[13:46:20] <robertmaxrees> you can keep those names, just use them as classes instead.
[13:46:37] <jquerynoob> now they've been renamed
[13:46:44] <jquerynoob> to class
[13:46:53] <jquerynoob> what should i do next?
[13:46:59] <robertmaxrees> well, is this in a form?
[13:47:00] <taplar> alright, so select those bad oys
[13:47:03] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[13:47:04] <taplar> *boys
[13:47:06] <robertmaxrees> listen to taplar
[13:49:40] <jquerynoob> do i select in the checkField function?
[13:49:52] <taplar> whatever function you have processing on submit
[13:50:11] <taplar> cause that's when you need them right?
[13:53:44] * taplar is hating his network
[13:58:07] <robertmaxrees> freenode is funky today
[13:58:42] <taplar> no, it's my network.  i've really noticed over the last couple days that my wireless network will drop and then it takes a bit for my vpn to reestablish
[13:59:06] <robertmaxrees> freenode has been having issues too, fwiw.
[13:59:10] <taplar> ah
[14:00:08] <taplar> i may have to go a day without irc and see if it still happens.  then be like, hey!  wtf?  i'm sitting 10 feet from an access point fool!
[14:25:46] <hassoon> taplar: hi
[14:25:53] <taplar> hey hey
[14:26:11] <hassoon> do i have to write functions like .css() or .html() i na certain format when used with delegated elements? i mean those elements added later using some dynamic ajax calls
[14:26:29] <robertmaxrees> you can't use them until after the content exists in the page.
[14:26:32] <hassoon> taplar: i meant by that if i have a tr added to a table dynamically with some ajax call
[14:26:33] <taplar> ^
[14:26:40] <robertmaxrees> and those elements are "delegated" fwiw.
[14:26:47] <robertmaxrees> use classes for that instead.
[14:26:56] <hassoon> classes? :o
[14:27:03] <robertmaxrees> instead of .css()
[14:27:12] <robertmaxrees> use classes and define those styles in your stylesheets.
[14:55:14] <hassoon> robertmaxrees: okey, the thing here, is that i have a table representing the data contained in a DB's table, in this example there are 3 rows in a table of sales  http://i.imgur.com/hMGAkbS.jpg , every line has a set of buttons in the first td, where the blue one called 'Modifier', triggers a floatting form (in a bootstrap modal) to modify the row's fields, but after modifying the values and submitting the
[14:55:20] <hassoon> m, the expected effect in the modified row doesn't work with the dynamically-added rows, but it works with the other rows generated automatically with the page load/refrech
[14:55:23] <hassoon> d'oh..
[14:55:56] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:56:08] <taplar> sounds like your binding something on existing rows and not on the dynamically created ones
[14:56:14] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:56:19] <robertmaxrees> you want event delegation.
[14:57:20] <hassoon> yeah so event delegation is the main the main thing here? i used .css() and .html() with the dynamically-added rows, they are not event handlers no ?
[14:57:50] <taplar> huh?
[14:58:37] <hassoon> taplar: sir, that's the main code that i bound to pressing the 'modify' button  http://paste.debian.net/365613/
[14:58:56] <hassoon> the code between lines 123 and 129 are the issue here
[15:02:37] <taplar> that's a lot of #myModal look ups btw
[15:03:45] <hassoon> taplar: yeah, the modifying form is rendered i nthe #myModal bs modal
[15:04:02] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/wvm5Ldy7/
[15:04:47] <taplar> so did you say what is not happening that you think should be?  i got disconnected for a sec if you did
[15:04:58] <hassoon> taplar: sir did you really understand my issue? :o
[15:05:13] <taplar> still trying to figure that out, :)
[15:05:28] <hassoon> taplar: yeah, the lines between 123 and 129 did not work with dynamically-added rows with ajax
[15:05:32] <hassoon> thats all
[15:05:46] <taplar> what do you mean did not work
[15:05:50] <taplar> ?
[15:05:55] <hassoon> there, taplar  http://paste.debian.net/365613/
[15:06:25] <taplar> no i mean.  did not work can mean a few things
[15:06:35] <taplar> do you mean it didn't execute?  did it do the else instead?
[15:07:50] <hassoon> taplar: yeah i did not see the expected effects from that those lines, which are the modified row getting blue-bordered, then gettign the ajax response (which is a set of td's), and yet a border-colour reset
[15:08:26] <taplar> so if you add a console.log to the true case of the if, you see that log?
[15:09:29] <hassoon> what if ?
[15:09:44] <taplar> if (result.indexOf('<td') == 0) {
[15:10:04] <hassoon> taplar: ah, i used alert to see the value of result
[15:10:09] <hassoon> and it was true
[15:10:09] <taplar> in the else
[15:10:14] <hassoon> taplar: yes/
[15:10:17] <hassoon> ah
[15:10:26] <hassoon> you want me to use console.log instead of alert ?
[15:10:46] <taplar> no, i was just wanting a console log in the true case to verify that it was executing and was going into that code block
[15:12:14] <taplar> also that result in that function should have a var in front of it to make it scoped down
[15:12:23] <taplar> otherwise it's going to be global
[15:13:04] <hassoon> taplar: ah
[15:13:19] <hassoon> anyway did i make myself clear :o
[15:13:36] <taplar> did you put a console in the if and did you see it print?
[15:14:07] <hassoon> taplar: sorry i have never used this console method before
[15:14:20] <taplar> console.log('hey, the if was true')
[15:14:31] <taplar> and then look at your browser console for the result
[15:15:56] <hassoon> taplar: ah, lemme try that
[15:20:52] <hassoon> taplar: anyway, the new data is indeed saved in the DB, that makes me sure that the said block of code between lines 123 and 129 did not work with dynamially-added rows
[15:21:21] <taplar> assume the best, but verify
[15:22:15] <taplar> i don't have a working example of the issue in front of me, so all I can advise you to do is to insert some logging so we can track down the issue
[15:22:47] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you can check out fixingthesejquery.com for a great guide on troubleshooting and debugging :)
[15:25:07] <hassoon> robertmaxrees: i'm sure of what's going on here, and what's left to ask about is whether newly-added elements with ajax can be accessed using their id's in instructions like $(new_element_id).html(content);
[15:25:17] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[15:25:25] <robertmaxrees> as long as you do thta when the element exists.
[15:25:52] <hassoon> ah
[15:26:32] <robertmaxrees> think of it this way - can you access a js variable before it's declared
[15:46:37] <Es0teric> anybody here?
[15:46:43] <taplar> nope
[15:46:49] <taplar> sup
[15:48:35] <Es0teric> ok so quick question -- if i do an $.each() on a <ul> for its <li>  but i am looking for a specific css class, how do i iterate through only the <li> elements that contain the class that i am looking for in them? taplar
[15:48:52] <taplar> do a filter first
[15:49:04] <Es0teric> taplar filter?
[15:49:20] <taplar> yep so for instance
[15:49:52] <taplar> $('ul li').filter(function(){ return $(this).css('color') === 'red'; }).each(...)
[15:50:24] <taplar> filter() will cause the result set to only contain those elements that matched your conditional
[15:51:02] <taplar> filter() also takes selectors, if your conditional could be evaluated that way
[15:51:24] <taplar> $('ul li').filter('.colorRed').each(...)
[15:51:30] <taplar> if you used a class instead of inline css
[15:52:36] <Es0teric> taplar would i use $(this).find('.someClass'); ?
[15:53:03] <taplar> provided that 'this' contains children with that class, that's a valid statement
[15:55:55] <Es0teric> taplar ahhh i see now ok
[16:11:08] <jquery039> i have a getJSON question
[16:11:32] <jquery039> i am trying to parse in a JSON file via jQuery.
[16:13:34] <jquery039> i have a getJSON question
[16:13:37] <taplar> la la la, did i miss the getJSON question?
[16:14:06] <jquery039> i am using jQuery.getJSON("fileName.json").responseText
[16:14:15] <jquery039> but the responseText is underfined
[16:14:22] <taplar> yeah, it's an ajax request
[16:14:31] <taplar> you have to access it in the done or success method
[16:14:42] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/
[16:15:19] <jquery039> I tried jQuery.getJSON("fileName.json").done(function(data){console.log(data.responseText)})
[16:15:30] <taplar> try just data
[16:15:32] <jquery039> but just get a empty object
[16:16:02] <taplar> since your using getJSON it's expecting the response to be json so it's already parsing it for you
[16:16:18] <jquery039> if i try just data... i just get the object at readyState 1
[16:16:37] <taplar> hmm?
[16:17:03] <jquery039> so should i just call parseJSON instead? i am just trying to parse a local JSON file inside my JS
[16:17:32] <taplar> $.getJSON(url, function(data){ console.log(data); });
[16:18:10] <taplar> as shown in the second code block in the docs
[16:23:54] <jquery039> data is still undefined
[16:24:42] <taplar> strange.  in your network tab find that request and look at the response.  is it actually json?
[16:26:03] <taplar> you may have to re-run it with the network tab open for it to list
[16:30:34] <jquery039> says it is type xhr
[16:30:37] <jquery039> not json
[16:31:28] <hlvwrk> hey anyone familiar with select2?
[16:31:39] <hlvwrk> kind of just an offhand question, no need for a fiddle.
[16:31:54] <hlvwrk> How would you determine if the select2 placeholder is selected or not?
[16:41:01] <jquery039> getJSON expects a JSON response but i get xhr when i am trying to get a local file
[16:41:20] <NoiseEee> hmmm?
[16:41:29] <taplar> so you will most likely not be able to use getJSON, unless you change your endpoint to return only json
[16:41:50] <Synthead> I'm trying to debug why some things are working in Chromium but not Firefox, so I saved some HTML and uploaded it to the W3C validator.  One of the items it mentioned was: "Bad value presentation for attribute role on element a".  This is on some jQuery tabs I'm using.  What's going on here?
[16:42:15] <taplar> attribute 'role'?
[16:42:34] <taplar> probably complaining about a non-standard attribute not being prefixed with data-
[16:42:38] <jquery039> yeah it is just a local file... a json file. so it isn't going to return anything... i just want to read it in. so i can call some of the variables in JS
[16:43:38] <taplar> jquery039:change getJSON to just get and see if your data logs
[16:43:38] <Synthead> taplar: yeah, like <a ... role="presentation" ...>.  This is the tag: <a href="http://localhost:3000/#items" class="ui-tabs-anchor" role="presentation" tabindex="-1" id="ui-id-1">
[16:43:53] <taplar> yeah, that's probably what it's complaining about
[16:44:02] <Synthead> taplar: it appears to be generated via jQuery's .tabs()
[16:44:50] <Synthead> taplar: take a look: http://jsfiddle.net/queryj/CnEUh/1/
[16:45:20] <Synthead> taplar: inspect one of the tabs and you'll see the role attribute on it
[16:46:32] <taplar> no i gotcha
[16:46:39] <taplar> i've explained why it's complaining
[16:46:51] <Synthead> taplar: it seems valid I think: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#presentation
[16:47:13] <Synthead> taplar: maybe role is just not valid for a tags?
[16:47:53] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a
[16:49:05] <Synthead> taplar: yeah, this too: https://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/single-page.html#the-a-element
[16:49:50] <Synthead> taplar: looks like jQuery is generating invalid HTML for this (to the best of my knowledge)
[16:51:11] <Synthead> taplar: ah, check it: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10122
[16:54:34] <mcfdez87> Anyone knows if extists any plugin to make an ajax call and put the response in the clioboard to paste in some where?
[16:59:04] <ismarkup> hello, should I use one $(document).ready(function() {}); instance? I got a file that has like 15 calls to it...and one different thing happens on each of this
[16:59:13] <Synthead> mcfdez87: looks like you're entering a small journey: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/400212/how-do-i-copy-to-the-clipboard-in-javascript
[16:59:30] <ismarkup> I have no idea why...but is it ok to consolidate all this into one only? this seems wrong
[16:59:33] <taplar> ismarkup:one is sufficient
[16:59:57] <ismarkup> taplar: calling it over and over is like...retarded right
[17:00:00] <ismarkup> repeating
[17:00:09] <taplar> it's unnecessary
[17:00:23] <Synthead> mcfdez87: for the reponse, just do something like $.ajax({... other ajax stuff ..., success: function(data) { however_youll_copy_it(data) });
[17:00:37] <ismarkup> unnecessary and bad coding imop
[17:00:40] <ismarkup> err imo*
[17:00:46] <mcfdez87> Synthead, do you know zeroclip plugin?
[17:00:48] <taplar> it's definately a smell, :)
[17:00:52] <ismarkup> lol
[17:00:54] <Synthead> mcfdez87: haven't heard of it
[17:01:01] <ismarkup> taplar: thanks bro
[17:01:18] <taplar> also you can shorthand those as just $(function(){...});
[17:01:39] <Synthead> mcfdez87: "The ZeroClipboard library provides an easy way to copy text to the clipboard using an invisible Adobe Flash movie and a JavaScript interface." ..... ew
[17:01:52] <ismarkup> taplar: WHAT?! so this is the same? -> $(function(){ ?
[17:01:56] <ismarkup> lmfao..
[17:01:56] <mcfdez87> Synthead, yes
[17:02:04] <ismarkup> there's many of those as well
[17:02:32] <taplar> yeah, that's the same as a doc ready
[17:02:48] <ismarkup> I'll unify the shit out of thise
[17:02:51] <ismarkup> this*
[17:02:52] <ismarkup> lol
[17:03:01] <taplar> now i will note something
[17:03:26] <taplar> if any of those are doing var declarations in them, then that specific doc ready is acting as a scoping mechanism
[17:03:42] <taplar> so if that is the case you could just change them to be IIFEs
[17:04:07] <ismarkup> taplar: there's many ajax calls
[17:04:12] <ismarkup> function calls
[17:04:41] <taplar> i'm referring to things like, hold on
[17:05:21] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/cucgcyh3/
[17:06:56] <taplar> in which case that was nested in a doc ready the 'intent' may have been to scope the variable down
[17:07:03] <taplar> in which case it could be changed to
[17:07:48] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/cucgcyh3/1/
[17:07:53] <taplar> would serve the same purpose
[17:17:59] <benskey> Hey guys, beginner here. I'm having problems implementing my tablesorter into my html file. Could any of you take a look?
[17:19:40] <taplar> http://tablesorter.com/docs/ this guy?
[17:20:06] <benskey> Yes. I read the documentation and everything, watched a video
[17:20:09] <benskey> still doesn't work
[17:20:15] <benskey> I'm not sure what im missing
[17:20:19] <benskey> but im sure that its something stupid
[17:20:23] <taplar> got a fiddle with what you've tried?
[17:20:42] <benskey> fiddle?
[17:20:48] <taplar> jsfiddle.net
[17:20:50] <benskey> oh
[17:21:04] <benskey> Should i upload my html only?
[17:21:17] <taplar> just enough to show the problem
[17:22:04] <benskey> Well, my guess would be that its in the head, with the included scripts
[17:22:36] <taplar> so the table html and the javascript where your trying to initialize the table
[17:22:51] <benskey> https://jsfiddle.net/yysp9ayp/ Are these even ok?
[17:23:20] <taplar> jquery can be included by clicking the javascript cog, and external scripts can be linked to with the External Resources on the left hand side
[17:29:22] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/990Lh1v2/
[17:29:34] <taplar> it doesn't include the styling the page had, but you can click the headers
[17:32:40] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/990Lh1v2/1/ there we go, included the theme css
[17:33:59] <bonks> Hi guys, I have this snippet of code http://pastebin.com/BWYHFkd3 and element does not contain anything (yet). A process will load these nodes in element and afterwards I need to access element.cashier, etc. How do I rewrite this so it is lazy or can detect later changes?
[17:35:04] <taplar> load the elements into the object when they're added?
[17:35:16] <bonks> I understanding with events I can do something like $('.parent').on('click', '.child-link') to capture clicks of .child-link that was added after registering the event.
[17:35:25] <taplar> yep
[17:35:34] <benskey> taplar: i have the same stuff in my code. Table's arent sortable
[17:35:56] <bonks> taplar: I want to do somethign similar here and I cant load the elements until later.
[17:36:02] <taplar> benskey:you got something else going on then.  first check your console to see if there are any errors
[17:36:13] <benskey> oh no i fucking didnt
[17:36:17] <benskey> kill me
[17:36:20] <taplar> ?
[17:36:32] <benskey> <script type="text/javasript"> ....
[17:36:36] <benskey> javasript
[17:36:37] <benskey> mhm
[17:36:40] <benskey> love this
[17:36:41] <taplar> you can leave type off
[17:36:51] <benskey> wasnt working without this
[17:36:53] <benskey> works now
[17:36:58] <benskey> i really want to die
[17:36:59] <snowman44> :D happens benskey
[17:37:01] <benskey> past 2 hours
[17:37:12] * taplar agrees with snowman44
[17:37:43] <arc_> every programmer has wasted a whole day on something that dumb
[17:37:45] <snowman44> so bonks, you want to have that chunk of code you have there, and after element is loaded you want to update the variable elements, have i gotten that right?
[17:37:50] <bonks> taplar: Any other solutions than loading the element earlier?
[17:38:01] <bonks> snowman44: Sounds about right, yes
[17:38:04] <taplar> you can't load it with things that don't exist yet
[17:38:30] <snowman44> that is true, but you could rewrite it to a function
[17:38:35] <snowman44> closure*
[17:38:37] <snowman44> gimme a sec
[17:38:44] <taplar> and aside from Observers (which are not fully supported yet), or periodically polling the dom (which is not a great idea), there isn't any event when children are added to an element
[17:38:59] <snowman44> and just invoke that
[17:39:01] <taplar> so the best thing is to do your work in the logic that inserts the children
[17:39:34] <bonks> Hmm I was trying to organize the code to have all the elements I'm about to use declared upfront
[17:39:55] <taplar> you can create the containing object sure, and set the children later
[17:40:34] <bonks> Oh!! I understand now. When the children are added, immediately assign all these values to elements
[17:40:43] <taplar> yep
[17:41:28] <taplar> though, from your snipplet they all belong to element, so really you could just carry that around
[17:43:14] <snowman44> bonks isn't this kinda the thing you wanted: http://pastebin.com/yiGVEdQn
[17:43:26] <chardizard> y'all mother fuckers know how to titlecase in lodash?
[17:44:06] <taplar> i'm not familiar with lodash
[17:44:35] <taplar> snowman44:your get() looks funky
[17:44:40] <bonks> snowman44: Yes technically yes. Should I be worried about performance with it calling all those finds every time I access elements
[17:44:54] <snowman44> it does not call them every time bonks, only once in line 18
[17:45:11] <snowman44> after that it is not any different from a variable
[17:45:17] <bonks> snowman44: oops I should've scrolled. You are right
[17:46:06] <bonks> This should do it. Feels like a workaround but that's ok by me :D
[17:46:09] <bonks> Thanks!
[17:46:27] <snowman44> yeah my get looks funky, theres something missing ^^
[17:46:30] <snowman44> wait up a sek bonks
[17:46:34] <taplar> your not returning an object
[17:46:42] <bonks> ok
[17:46:45] <snowman44> yup, a return is missing
[17:46:52] <taplar> and a wrapping {}, :D
[17:47:22] <benskey> On the same note, guys how can I give for example, a table, multiple ID's?
[17:47:28] <benskey> or a class and a ID
[17:47:45] <taplar> class="myClass" id="myId"
[17:48:27] <taplar> would seem strange to give an element multiple ids
[17:48:30] <benskey> and multiple ID's? is that possible?
[17:48:40] <taplar> what would be the purpose?
[17:49:00] <arc_> it doesn't seem like that would be valid
[17:49:03] <benskey> for example one for the ID of tablesorting
[17:49:05] <al-damiri> Hi #/jquery.
[17:49:11] <benskey> and another ID for some look related stuff
[17:49:13] <benskey> with css
[17:49:26] <snowman44> oh crap taplar haha
[17:49:28] <taplar> ids are primarily for lookup, not styling
[17:49:34] <taplar> style based on your classes
[17:49:57] <benskey> ok, but giving it a class & id is ok?
[17:49:58] <taplar> snowman44:;)
[17:50:10] <taplar> benskey:yep, and multiple classes is cool too
[17:50:22] <snowman44> here you go bonks http://pastebin.com/8zVcL1CX maybe taplar will have a look over it :P
[17:51:01] <taplar> looks fine
[17:51:52] <bonks> snowman44: I like the second. I could move lines 29-32 inline to make it more readable since I have way more elements to add
[17:52:24] <snowman44> i like the second more as well ^^ get's ugly with the get() in between
[17:52:34] <bonks> And it is lazy per-element
[17:52:53] <al-damiri> When I press enter (newline) in a textarea and then get the value of through jQuery $("#me-text-area").val() then it doesn't show the newlines, instead gets me a spaces.
[17:53:15] <al-damiri> But if I JSON.stringify the string value which I get from .val(), then I get newlines ("\n")
[17:53:32] * taplar love being disconnected
[17:53:39] <al-damiri> Any reason why? .val() doesn't show them but JSON.stringify does?
[17:54:20] <taplar> al-damiri:what is the object?
[17:54:28] <al-damiri> taplar: What object?
[17:54:33] <taplar> val() is a jQuery method
[17:54:38] <al-damiri> The one that's returne from .val()?
[17:54:44] <al-damiri> s/returne/returned
[17:54:45] <b-ot> Correction, <al-damiri> The one that's returned from .val()?
[17:55:03] <taplar> what type of object are you trying to do val() off of?
[17:55:11] <al-damiri> taplar: <textarea>
[17:55:19] <taplar> $('textarea') ?
[17:55:35] <al-damiri> $("#id-of-my-text=area")
[17:56:03] <taplar> ok, i thought val() was made so it worked for textareas, hmm.  try text()
[17:56:53] <al-damiri> taplar: $("#my-textarea").text() doesn't return anything.
[17:56:59] <al-damiri> I mean it returns an empty string.
[17:57:02] <taplar> hmm
[17:57:32] <chardizard> smoke crack every day
[17:57:35] <taplar> console.log($('#my-textarea').length);
[17:57:54] <benskey> guys, any clue why tablesorter would be working on one table and not another ?..
[17:58:02] <chardizard> console.log("ONLY NIGGERS SMOKE CRACK");
[17:58:18] <al-damiri> taplar:1
[17:59:01] <taplar> hmm
[17:59:16] <bonks> snowman44: I can't call line 51, it has to be elements().locationName() and because of this I don't need line 50
[18:00:01] <snowman44> bonks, you call line 50 after element is loaded, after that you never have to call line 50 again, you can access the variables in elements like this: elements.locationName()
[18:00:44] <snowman44> but if you want elements to be updated again and again, every time you need locationName, then you can just call elements().locationName() always
[18:01:03] <bonks> Ok let me try again
[18:01:15] <snowman44> al-damiri the newline thing is a problem with html and css, html collapses white-space by default
[18:01:25] <taplar> al-damiri:not sure what you have going on https://jsfiddle.net/v6qs5Lx0/
[18:01:32] <snowman44> gotta add something like white-space:pre-wrap or something i believe al-damiri
[18:02:12] <al-damiri> snowman44: But how come after I get the string value from .val() and JSON stringify it, the space reveals its actual value.
[18:02:16] <al-damiri> For exampe:
[18:02:56] <al-damiri> Aw my god.
[18:03:06] <taplar> mine too!
[18:03:08] <taplar> wat?
[18:03:11] <al-damiri> So I tried copying the output from Chrome console.
[18:03:25] <al-damiri> and tried pasting it in notepad, there are newlines and tabs.
[18:03:42] <al-damiri> It's just that, for some reason, Chrome's console isn't displaying them.
[18:03:53] <taplar> mine is in that link i gave
[18:04:03] <al-damiri> That's how JSON.stringify knows that this a newline and that's a tab.
[18:04:06] <al-damiri> I see now.
[18:04:35] <snowman44> good thing you got onto that now, tho :D
[18:05:14] <al-damiri> taplar: Your example proved useful too.
[18:05:32] <al-damiri> So the thing is that if you do console.log(), it displays the newlines and tabs properly.
[18:06:04] <al-damiri> but if you just do $("#my-text-area") in the console (Chrome's console), you'll get the output in a single line.
[18:06:15] <al-damiri> With all the whitespace squeezed just to a single space.
[18:06:40] <snowman44> i believe chromes console is putting that out as html which ignores whitespaces ? would be my guess
[18:06:44] <al-damiri> snowman44, taplar: Thanks.
[18:06:53] <taplar> you mean you put only that in the console?
[18:06:59] <taplar> $('#my-text-area')
[18:07:03] <al-damiri> taplar: Yes, that's what I was trying.
[18:07:07] <bonks> snowman44: Is element.find()[0] the most efficient way to do what I'm doing here?
[18:07:13] <taplar> that's going to log the jQuery object
[18:07:22] <al-damiri> taplar: Nope.
[18:07:25] <taplar> bonks:what are you trying to do
[18:07:36] <bonks> taplar append stuff to those elements
[18:07:38] <al-damiri> Sorry, it was this: $("#my-text-area").val()
[18:07:38] <taplar> [0] will break out of the jQuery object, if that is desired
[18:07:42] <snowman44> bonks can you show me the pastebin again ^^
[18:07:50] <bonks> taplar: Hah! I just found that I needed to wrap it in $()
[18:07:54] <taplar> no
[18:07:56] <taplar> use get()
[18:08:00] <taplar> err sorry
[18:08:01] <taplar> eq()
[18:08:12] <taplar> eq() is like [] but will not break out of the jQuery object
[18:08:15] <bonks> snowman44: http://pastebin.com/8zVcL1CX
[18:08:22] <bonks> taplar: TIL! Let me try
[18:08:37] <taplar> and from what I saw you were finding on ids, so that's not really necessary
[18:08:44] <taplar> your only going to have one
[18:09:27] <taplar> al-damiri:that's interesting
[18:09:34] <bonks> One within the parent element... so shit I just realized if there is more than one instance on the page the id's could conflict
[18:09:44] <taplar> will
[18:09:49] <snowman44> why dont you go $('#receipt-cashier') in the first place, since those are ids? can just ahve one of em anyway
[18:10:03] <snowman44> if you want more than one you should use a class
[18:10:09] <taplar> ^
[18:10:13] <bonks> snowman44: I'm going to have to change them to classes. Yeah originally they were single instance
[18:10:37] <taplar> i'm going to go play in traffic.  catch everyone later
[18:11:09] <snowman44> well when you change those to classes, just do $('.receipt-cashier').eq(i) - dont need the element in front
[18:12:00] <snowman44> nevertheless i'm out 2, has gotten 2 late again... bye guys
[18:12:16] <bonks> ok see ya guys and thanks again

[19:16:06] <ABM_Dan> I am initializing a plugin, and in two of the events defined I want to run the same function, is there a way for me to set a callback to use a different callback?
[19:26:08] <HowardwLo> https://dpaste.de/LgCC I’m having a real pain in the ass. When I post this result, client_ids is not in the post data. var userID is also undefined when I log it. However, typeof userid on line 37 prints out string. when I type getUserId() in browser it returns undfined and String. im really lost :(

[22:18:56] <jquerysucks> hi is there a site where i can practice traversing the dom with jquery?
[22:31:02] <gambl0re> codeschool.com has courses
[23:00:37] <livingstn> does cachedScript use a file relative to the calling script or the site url?
[23:44:24] <VectorX> hi, on a wordpress site/theme i am loading jquery like "<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>" in the header, next if i try to use  $(document).ready(function(){ i get an error "Uncaught TypeError: $ is not a function" what do i need to do so that $ works ?
[23:45:50] <arc_> VectorX is that code that's trying to call jquery below where you loaded jquery in your html document
[23:45:58] <VectorX> yes
[23:46:27] <arc_> i think wordpress has some specific way you're supposed to load external libraries
[23:48:00] <arc_> VectorX http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script#jQuery_noConflict_Wrappers
[23:48:54] <VectorX> thanks
[23:55:31] <VectorX> ive actually read that several times, but it makes more sense now
[23:56:36] <arc_> according to that page, wordpress should come with jquery so you shouldn't need to load it yourself
