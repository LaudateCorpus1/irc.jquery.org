[01:26:43] <hollusion> pagios: if($("#home").length)
[01:26:50] <hollusion> checks if #home exists or not
[01:28:46] <cyberbrai>  pagios https://api.jquery.com/length/

[01:32:58] <pagios> thanks
[01:33:57] <pagios>   $("#app-status-ul").append('<li>registering ' + '</li>')    <-- will add a child li for the first match of #app-status-ui ?
[01:34:56] <cyberbrai> Pagios yes
[01:35:15] <cyberbrai> pagios if you have fiddle then it's great
[01:35:19] <pagios> so no need to look with jquery, it will loop for me
[01:35:28] <pagios> my first few minutes with jquery
[01:35:44] <pagios> it is like an sql query
[01:35:57] <pagios> can return 1 element or multiple
[01:36:07] <cyberbrai> pagios no sql query
[01:36:41] <pagios> i mean the $('') can return arrays variable , element multiple emennets
[01:36:47] <pagios> no?
[01:37:22] <cyberbrai> Pagios if you append the  append('<li>registering ' + '</li>') to $("#app-status-ul"). it's append on first  ul li
[01:37:46] <cyberbrai> PLEASE explain what you need exactly

[01:39:50] <pagios> or can only return 1 element
[01:41:17] <cyberbrai> Pagios it's return when you want ok it's depend on your function then it's return or not

[02:30:10] <jacoub92> Hello, How I can edit ajax response by ajaxComplete function?
[02:44:54] <kostodo> Is it possible to have the overlap/intersect of these two divs not affect each other with opacity: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/jEoNyw
[02:46:53] <kostodo> Basically I’m trying to create that blue shape thats sticking out the side
[02:58:35] <hollusion> pagios: $('*') returns all elements
[02:58:46] <hollusion> $('a') returns all <a> elements
[02:58:47] <pagios> ok
[02:59:07] <hollusion> as an array of objects
[02:59:32] <hollusion> press F12 and use the DOM inspector + console
[02:59:43] <hollusion> will help a lot understanding what is happening
[03:00:15] <hollusion> try console.log($('body')); and look at the console
[03:00:45] <kostodo> Is there a way to clip off the intersect of two absolutely positioned divs?
[03:42:39] <cyberbrai> good morning

[03:55:25] <no_gravity> Hello!
[03:55:36] <cyberbrai> Hello no gravity
[03:55:42] <no_gravity> Has jquery an elegant way to check which radio button is selected?
[03:56:06] <cyberbrai> set it true false then you got it
[03:56:22] <no_gravity> ?
[03:56:36] <arthurvr> no_gravity: let me show you a fiddle
[03:56:38] <arthurvr> 5 minutes
[03:56:41] <no_gravity> yo
[03:57:07] <cyberbrai> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20627906/how-to-know-which-radio-button-is-selected-in-jquery
[03:57:29] <arthurvr> yeah quite exactly that
[03:57:34] <no_gravity> aha! that was what i was looking for!
[03:57:36] <no_gravity> thanks a lot!
[03:57:44] <arthurvr> google before asking us lol
[03:57:48] <no_gravity> i googled
[03:57:58] <Woet> what did you google for?
[03:58:07] <no_gravity> "javascript check which radio button selected"
[03:58:15] <Woet> why javascript if you want jquery?
[03:58:27] <cyberbrai> no_gravity see the link i send you it's solve your problem
[03:58:28] <no_gravity> jquery was an afterthought
[03:58:37] <no_gravity> cyberbrai: yes, thanks!
[03:58:38] <Woet> its the first result for "jquery check which radio button selected"
[03:58:55] <no_gravity> yo
[03:59:09] <cyberbrai> no_gravity np
[03:59:18] <cyberbrai> no_gravity any other question
[03:59:39] <no_gravity> oh, lots of questions.. but not so much jquery related
[03:59:51] <no_gravity> mainly i think about usability these days
[04:00:16] <cyberbrai> no_gravity ok
[04:04:16] <no_gravity> is this the right way these days to add a callback to the submit event of a form? $("#theform").on("submit", thefunction) ?
[04:08:18] <cyberbrai> give id to submit button then call it
[04:09:29] <no_gravity> ?
[04:10:29] <cyberbrai> no_gravity fiddle
[04:10:31] <cyberbrai> plz
[04:11:06] <no_gravity> cyberbrai: i think $("#theform").on("submit",thefunction) is fine.
[04:11:15] <no_gravity> just wanted to hear if that is outdated or something.
[04:13:19] <Woet> no_gravity: $("#theform").submit(function(){ // your code });
[04:13:41] <Woet> cyberbrai: why are you asking people for a fiddle if their question is literally about 1 line of code they mentioned afterwards?
[04:13:46] <no_gravity> Woet: yeah, i know you can do that. but i prefer to not nest functions.
[04:14:03] <Woet> no_gravity: how are you nesting functions?
[04:14:23] <Woet> it's a single function within the callback
[04:14:52] <cyberbrai> Woet i thought may be they deal with big one
[04:15:09] <no_gravity> Woet: yeah, i don't put functions into paramter lists.
[04:15:19] <Woet> cyberbrai: i don't see any part of their question implying there is more to it.
[04:15:37] <Woet> cyberbrai: he also asked about how to add a callback, not how to call a submit button.
[04:16:28] <cyberbrai> Woet ok i thought if we have  a fiddle then it's great  sorry for askinh fidle
[04:16:59] <Woet> cyberbrai: i love fiddles too, when there is a need for them.
[04:17:16] <cyberbrai> Woet ok
[04:48:55] <sadtaco> How do I match only the classes that are the most outer level?  As in, less deeply nested.  I have many elements with a class, and I'm trying to select the "highest" siblings first.
[04:49:27] <sadtaco> .find().eq(0).siblings().andSelf() hits the first one down the page, not the highest depth match
[05:31:36] <Sagar> Hello,
[05:32:40] <arthurvr> hey Sagar
[05:32:50] <Sagar> how are you arthurvr?
[05:33:08] <arthurvr> I’m fine how about you?
[05:33:30] <Sagar> Fine too, i need a bit help, how can i achieve a function to check wheather the posted url by user is a simple url or a file
[05:34:04] <Sagar> Just us assume, the user post http://www.abc.com/ or www.abc.com or www.abc.com/file.exe
[05:34:23] <arthurvr> That’s gonna be difficult on the client side I guess.
[05:34:23] <Sagar> I want to check if the posted data is a file or domain and do functions accordingly
[05:34:55] <Sagar> But we can check that with jquery will making a ajax request
[05:35:00] <Sagar> so that wouldnt be a problem i guess
[05:37:42] <arthurvr> Sagar: You can’t just request everything on the internet haha
[05:37:57] <arthurvr> Sagar: + how are you going to detect that kind of stuff
[05:38:06] <arthurvr> You can’t just check for an extension or so.
[05:38:25] <Sagar> i tried with
[05:38:37] <Sagar>     if ( redirectUrl.indexOf('.apk') > -1 ) {
[05:38:48] <Sagar> but that will limit me to add all the possible extensions
[05:39:17] <arthurvr> Sagar: Yeah but that’s not secure at all
[05:39:38] <arthurvr> I can serve a binary file under a html extension, although that will cause troubles it’s possible.
[05:39:49] <Sagar> that's what i said, people can do domain.com/?.apk
[05:40:32] <arthurvr> What kind of files do you want to block?
[05:40:38] <arthurvr> all binaries?
[05:40:43] <Sagar> yeah probably
[05:40:50] <Sagar> or can we achieve that with mime type
[05:40:59] <arthurvr> once again not safe.
[05:41:24] <arthurvr> Could whitelist only https://www.npmjs.com/package/text-extensions, if you’re not planning to use it for validation.
[05:41:40] <arthurvr> you can’t validate this way.
[05:41:40] <Sagar>  success: function(response, status, xhr){ var ct = xhr.getResponseHeader("content-type") || ""; if (ct.indexOf('html') > -1) {
[05:41:44] <Sagar> wouldnt that work
[05:41:55] <arthurvr> do you want it to be safe? No, then not.
[05:43:43] <no_gravity> I find it fascinating what a long way JavaScript has come, and yet there is no require_once()
[05:43:45] <Sagar> Yes i want it save
[05:44:07] <arthurvr> Sagar: not possible client-side then.
[05:44:23] <Sagar> 1 question. how can it be not safe?
[05:44:45] <arthurvr> People serving something with wrong extensions lol
[05:45:06] <arthurvr> no_gravity: why do you want that? Do you mean node or in the browser?
[05:45:19] <Sagar> lol, i want it for scanning that's all, no uploads etc.
[05:45:30] <Sagar> just they input a url, it should tell them, it's a file or a normal url
[05:45:32] <no_gravity> arthurvr: in the browser. so a script can say "i need jquery" for example.
[05:45:34] <Sagar> and return the scan status that's all
[05:45:56] <arthurvr> no_gravity: And what adventage does that have against AMD or even just <script> tags?
[05:46:15] <no_gravity> arthurvr: you cannot put a script tag in a script.
[05:46:33] <no_gravity> arthurvr: so a script these days has a hard time being self contained.
[05:47:12] <arthurvr> no_gravity: that would first of all be really bad practice, also, in fact you can.
[05:47:28] <arthurvr> + that being sync would perf wise be the worst.
[05:47:50] <no_gravity> there is no elegant way of doing it.
[05:48:06] <no_gravity> in fact there might be no way at all.
[05:48:09] <arthurvr> no_gravity: and in what way would require_once be elegant?
[05:48:35] <arthurvr> It would never be async so would just be terribly slow
[05:49:00] <no_gravity> it would be nice if there was a sync way of doing it.
[05:49:18] <arthurvr> no_gravity: Plus, I guess what you’re searching for is just called AMD lol
[05:49:23] <arthurvr> no_gravity: That would be the worst!
[05:49:39] <no_gravity> for a local file, one could do a sync XMLHttpRequest request and then eval the result.
[05:49:46] <no_gravity> but for external libs i think there is no way.
[05:49:55] <arthurvr> no_gravity: I guess you’re just thinking about how you would use it but it has way to much bad usage.
[05:50:11] <arthurvr> There are way to many noobs building stuff for functions like that.
[05:50:38] <arthurvr> no_gravity: Plus you can just do that if you really want that by script tags lol
[05:50:55] <no_gravity> adding a script tag will result in async loding.
[05:51:00] <arthurvr> Anyways waiting for ES6 modules to save use all \o/
[05:51:05] <no_gravity> so you cannot do that and use the lib right away.
[05:51:08] <arthurvr> no_gravity: That’s a good thing, not a bad result.
[05:51:29] <no_gravity> it results in pretty terrible code
[05:51:30] <arthurvr> no_gravity: That’s javascript, like, by design.
[05:51:38] <arthurvr> not the bad code I mean lol
[05:51:44] <arthurvr> It results in fast and performant code.
[05:51:58] <no_gravity> a lot of lines just to include a file. and then you must change your code into a state machine just to use some lib.
[05:52:49] <arthurvr> no_gravity: No, because that wouldn’t be the use case. If you want to build something like that, you should just use script tags. Guess you wrote too much php lol
[05:53:50] <arthurvr> no_gravity: Google for the TC39 discussions about ES6 modules, it will crear things up.
[05:54:14] <arthurvr> ~clear
[05:54:17] * arthurvr can’t spell
[06:06:38] <Sagar> how can i get the status match?
[06:06:52] <Sagar>     if ( redirectUrl.match( /(png|mp3|apk)/ ) ) { console.log("File Detected, Type: APK");
[06:07:02] <Sagar> i want to print the redirectURl.match case
[06:13:57] <no_gravity> Sagar: r=/png|mp3|apk/;t=url.match(r);if (t) alert ("type: "+t[0]);
[06:42:21] <Sagar>     if ( url.match( /(.png|.mp3|.apk)/ ) ) { console.log('File') } else { console.log('url'); }
[06:43:09] <Sagar> what would be the regex to check the url contains url a file extension after backslash /
[06:55:12] <Sagar> what would be the regex to file the url contains png,jpg,exe
[07:23:10] <Sagar> hello
[07:24:11] <Sagar> Hey /^(\w+:\/\/[\w\._~:/?#\[\]@!$&'()*+,;=%]*|[^\.]+\.[^\.]+)$/ this is my regex to check url contains a file extension or not, how can i extend it to if domain.com/file.exe?somerandomstringsaswell or domain.com/file.exe#somerandomstringsaswell
[07:27:28] <Surop> hey
[07:27:32] <Surop> I wrote a plugin today
[07:27:35] <Surop> to do form validation
[07:27:47] <Surop> and need to check if a string is a valid mail
[07:27:55] <Surop> what regex can I use?
[07:28:23] <arthurvr> Surop: Use  /^([\w_\.\-\+])+\@([\w\-]+\.)+([\w]{2,10})+$/
[07:28:32] <arthurvr> Surop: https://github.com/regexps/regex-email
[07:28:37] <arthurvr> Surop: works well
[07:29:05] <Surop> great arthurvr
[07:29:09] <Surop> ty
[07:29:27] <Surop> can I ask another question as well?
[07:29:33] <arthurvr> `ask
[07:29:33] <b-ot> arthurvr: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:29:40] <Surop> ty again
[07:29:58] <Sagar> arthurvr: can u help me?
[07:30:57] <arthurvr> Sagar: Yes, of course, but not if it’s still the same thing as this morning. I don’t want to encourage that idea, I still think about it the same way.
[07:31:05] <Surop> So here comes my question.
[07:31:31] <Surop> If I wrap things in a function expression why do I still am able to extend jQuery.fn?
[07:31:35] <Sagar> arthurvr: it's just all i need
[07:31:42] <Surop> it's scoped right
[07:31:49] <Sagar> > /^(\w+:\/\/[\w\._~:/?#\[\]@!$&'()*+,;=%]*|[^\.]+\.[^\.]+)$/ is my regex
[07:31:59] <Sagar>  how can i extend it to if domain.com/file.exe?somerandomstringsaswell or domain.com/file.exe#somerandomstringsaswell
[07:32:23] <arthurvr> Surop: It is scoped, but globally as jQuery is declared globally.
[07:33:11] <arthurvr> Sugar: It really does not make sense to ask things twice. You already asked like 10 minutes ago lol. If somebody is able and willing to help you they’ll do that.
[07:33:23] <Surop> what a messy regex by the way
[07:33:28] <Surop> arthurvr: not yours the others
[07:34:57] <Surop> Sagar:just use path.extname why not
[07:35:16] <arthurvr> Surop: because he’s in a browser environment I guess
[07:35:29] <Surop> haha yea
[07:36:55] <Sagar> arthurvr?
[07:37:53] <Surop> Sagar:You missed arthurs answer?
[07:38:08] <Surop> guys I've got another question.
[07:39:48] <Surop> What's the base tooling you need for building jQuery plugins and how to set it up? I always have troubles setting up qunit, server, grunt,... what tooling do you use?
[07:40:12] <arthurvr> I mostly start with generator-jquery is a base. Has qunit, grunt, server
[07:40:21] <arthurvr> + base best-practices coupled
[07:40:26] <arthurvr> check https://github.com/yeoman/generator-jquery
[07:40:36] <arthurvr> Surop: You know yeoman huh?
[07:40:44] <Surop> yeah I toyed with it
[07:40:46] <Surop> thank you
[07:41:48] <Surop> yo jquery should work isn't it?
[07:42:08] <arthurvr> off topic but make sure you npm installed’ generator-jquery
[07:42:17] <arthurvr> globally, like other generators
[07:42:30] <Sagar> arthurvr?
[07:42:32] <Sagar> :|
[07:42:42] <Surop> oh so npm install --global generator-jquery yo bower grunt right?
[07:42:50] <arthurvr> Surop: exactly.
[07:43:11] <Surop> Sagar:He answered I think you missed that.
[07:43:20] <Surop> Thanks arthurvr.
[07:43:23] <Surop> Will try it
[07:43:34] <Surop> nice channel by the way
[07:43:39] <Surop> gonna lurk here some more.
[07:43:44] <arthurvr> glad to hear that! You’re welcome!
[07:43:44] <Sagar> yeah i got disconnected i think
[07:43:58] <Sagar> arthurvr did you answered?
[07:44:50] <arthurvr> Yes, I answered that I wasn’t going to answer lol
[07:44:52] <arthurvr> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/latest.log.html
[07:45:15] <Surop> Sagar:are you in browser or node?
[07:45:26] <Surop> I also mentioned path.extname
[07:45:44] <Surop> But you're in #jquery so I guess browser isn't i
[07:45:48] <Surop> sorry meant it
[07:46:32] <Surop> who read http://blog.jquery.com/2015/03/25/come-help-the-jquery-foundation/ ?
[07:46:39] <sash_> That's just some trivial substring stuff isn't it?
[07:47:11] <arthurvr> sash_: yeah not exaclty but quite that.
[07:47:26] <arthurvr> String.prototype.endsWith in fact
[07:47:43] <arthurvr> Sagar: And hey, I answered your question (still think your usecase is wrong)
[07:47:57] <arthurvr> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/endsWith
[07:48:05] <sash_> Yea, and a substring to check the .file#randomstugg
[07:48:07] <sash_> *ff
[07:48:39] <Surop> No, as arthurvr said that's unsafe.
[07:48:54] <arthurvr> k guys I really don’t want to have this discussion again :/
[07:49:11] <Sagar> see its all like
[07:49:16] <Surop> sash_: arthurvr: you're right arthurvr
[07:49:16] <Sagar> user come to myhost.com
[07:49:27] <Sagar> enter a domain or url or url containing file extension
[07:49:30] <Sagar> i want to return
[07:49:41] <Sagar> if only url ( its url ) else { file }
[07:50:03] <Surop> only tricky and unsafe solutions for that on the client side
[07:50:07] <Surop> as we said this morning!
[07:50:14] <Surop> you just seem to ignore it.
[07:50:26] <Sagar> like i said, doesnt matter if unable
[07:50:31] <Sagar> all i want to get the status
[07:50:43] <Sagar> the posted data is a url or have a extension (file) in it
[07:51:06] <Surop> if the logs are right you said it was for validation. That would be unsafe; extensions can lie.
[07:51:19] <Surop> anyways next up.
[07:51:25] <sash_> Well, yeah, that's backend stuff usually, of course.
[07:52:15] <Surop> Yeah use magic numbers to detect that on your server bro
[07:52:41] <Surop> + some sites are safe enough to prevent you from requesting that url using ajax.
[07:53:02] <Surop> but this discussion seems to be repeating itself :(
[07:53:31] <arthurvr> yup
[07:53:40] <Sagar> all i need to check
[07:53:53] <Sagar> the url posted has a extension in it or not
[07:54:16] <Surop> .match(/\./.+/)
[07:54:19] <Sagar> that's a better question i should ask
[07:54:40] <sash_> http://domain.tld/png.exe.jpg.docx.pdf.html
[07:54:52] <Surop> (still that usecase is wrong! Imagine big companies would go over safety this way.)
[07:55:27] <Sagar> Surop: would it work with extend it to if domain.com/file.exe?somerandomstringsaswell or domain.com/file.exe#somerandomstringsaswell
[07:55:29] <Sagar> as well?
[07:55:51] <sash_> m(
[07:56:19] <Surop> no. And it wouldn't work with double extensions as well. And so-called fake extensions also not. stop repeating this discussion, all has been told IMHO.
[07:57:28] <Sagar> Surop: .match(/\./.+/) i am asking about it
[07:57:39] <Sagar> how can i make it do what i said, i am a newbie, please help
[07:58:07] <Guest55644> what's the difference between (function() {})() and $(function(){})
[07:58:20] <arthurvr> Guest55644: the first one (a so-called iife) executes the code directly in its own scope
[07:58:24] <decx> they dont have anything in common
[07:58:30] <arthurvr> the second is a shorthand for a document ready statement
[07:58:30] <decx> maybe not anything
[07:58:35] <arthurvr> you can read about it here: http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[07:58:43] <arthurvr> and here http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[07:59:54] <Guest55644> decx:they do have stuff in common somebody told me? scope is 'cleared out'?
[07:59:58] <Guest55644> arthurvr ^
[08:00:08] <arthurvr> the code both lives in a separated function expression so that's totally true.
[08:00:33] <decx> hey i paddled back already from "anything" ;)
[08:00:46] <Guest55644> sorry missed that
[08:00:51] <Guest55644> thanks decx
[08:01:03] <Guest55644> And huge thanks to arthurvr as well of course!!
[08:02:46] <Surop> Can somebody explain me jQuery.Animation.prefilter? Seems like undocumented but sounds like handy. Sorry if i'm asking a stupid question.
[08:03:11] <arthurvr> It’s not that difficult, and indeed sadly undocumented, please see https://gist.github.com/gnarf/54829d408993526fe475#prefilters for now.
[08:03:18] <arthurvr> Surop: ^
[08:03:22] <Guest55644> Awesome
[08:03:23] <Guest55644> thanks
[08:04:32] <arthurvr> Guest55644: for?
[08:04:53] <Guest55644> just just learnt me something arthurvr
[08:04:56] <Guest55644> therefor
[08:05:22] <Guest55644> I didn't even know it existed :)
[08:05:25] <Uhkis> arthurvr: "for now" and thats from 2012 :-D
[08:05:38] <Uhkis> does it ever get updated?
[08:05:47] <decx> well that's because you don't volunteer to write docs, duh
[08:05:55] <decx> ^^
[08:05:56] <arthurvr> Well I do lol
[08:06:04] <decx> see
[08:06:08] <decx> blame uhkis
[08:06:22] <arthurvr> we’re making progress on it but just unsure if we want to promote the use of this api.
[08:06:34] <arthurvr> it’s the oldest open api.jquery.com ticket lol
[08:07:06] <Surop> Thanks arthurvr
[08:07:14] <Surop> yeah kind of sad
[08:07:25] <Surop> are there many api's like this?
[08:07:32] <decx> an succinct demo of what cool stuff can be achieved with it could garner the "publicity" to force the issue
[08:08:09] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/61 for those interested
[08:12:13] <Surop> decx: arthurvr: can I ask another question?
[08:12:18] <arthurvr> go for it.
[08:12:47] <arthurvr> `ask @ Surop
[08:12:47] <b-ot> Surop: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[08:15:16] <arthurvr> Surop: gonna quote b-ot ”Don't PM!”. Just ask your question in here.
[08:19:36] <decx> can't have been so important ^^
[08:19:55] <arthurvr> decx: he pm’d you as well?
[08:20:02] <decx> ye
[08:20:07] <arthurvr> :/
[08:20:16] <decx> dropped the usual: channelhelp is charity, pm is consulting
[08:20:55] <arthurvr> yeah I always just linkup irc.jquery.com
[08:20:57] <decx> til can't've is a thing
[08:21:57] <drej> lol decx
[08:22:06] <arthurvr> haha
[08:22:28] <arthurvr> These days I even get support emails from random people :)
[08:22:33] <drej> also shouldn't've
[09:00:49] <basiclaser> I have an array of objects. Each object contains two key value pairs. How do I search the object array for the value of one of the key-value pairs, using the value of its sibling key-value? http://jsbin.com/duvite/2/edit?js,console
[09:05:36] <arthurvr> basiclaser: let me see if I can work on something for you :)
[09:06:45] <basiclaser> arthurvr: thanks! console.log("siblinga".nextsibling.booya)
[09:07:52] <arthurvr> basiclaser: is this what you need? http://jsbin.com/suzicijeve/1/edit?js,console
[09:15:27] <basiclaser> arthurvr: thanks ! it looks great
[09:15:34] <basiclaser> it also taught me console.info
[09:31:51] <arthurvr> basiclaser: lol that’s pretty basic command line api :)
[09:32:56] <arthurvr> basiclaser: FYI https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/commandline-api
[10:24:40] <sash_> arthurvr: Is there a reason that the commandline-api site is completely surrounded by <p></p>?
[10:25:30] <arthurvr> sash_: Why would I know that?
[10:25:35] <arthurvr> lol
[10:25:37] <arthurvr> where?
[10:25:43] <sash_> In the source
[10:25:47] <arthurvr> haha I see
[10:25:50] <arthurvr> wtf
[10:26:10] <arthurvr> It’s open source so let’s fix it
[10:27:36] <sash_> new web standard established
[10:27:44] <arthurvr> haha
[10:28:21] <kostodo> How do I make an event if a mouse is over an element even if its over the children of that element
[10:28:41] <kostodo> :hover in css will stop firing once you hover over a child element
[10:29:55] <kostodo> What I want is any hover be it the parent div, or any of the child elements inside it
[10:29:56] <sash_> kostodo: I think, there is https://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/ and mouseleave for that case.
[10:30:34] <sash_> Also, hover() https://api.jquery.com/hover/
[10:31:17] <arthurvr> sash_: fixed their site. That’s the only right mentality when doing open source :)
[10:31:22] <arthurvr> https://github.com/GoogleChrome/devtools-docs/pull/269
[10:32:54] <naftilos76> How can i select an individual element out from a return value of .children() or .find("td") ? I tried doing [0] and i get html!
[10:33:47] <Uhkis> eq()
[10:35:15] <naftilos76> Uhkis, thank you very much
[10:43:04] <naftilos76> I was trying to stop a <a> inside a <td> cell from triggering the mouseup event of the <tr> with the .stopPropagation(). I did that by looping through the cells of the table but it just does not work.
[10:43:06] <naftilos76> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/78c75dbb856e3852fe01
[10:45:37] <naftilos76> Is the code supposed to work?
[10:46:25] <sash_> arthurvr: There was also an opening tag. Before <DOCTYPE ...
[10:47:32] <arthurvr> sash_: w00t that’s a weird one. Lemme take a look.
[11:12:59] <arthurvr> sash_: There’s a problem with their markdown rendering engine. Pinged some friends at google about it
[11:19:15] <sash_> arthurvr: Thought so :)
[11:21:15] <se_bu5ca_ayuda> how to get the value of an element using only it's class?
[11:22:45] <sash_> se_bu5ca_ayuda: $('classname').html()?
[11:22:56] <se_bu5ca_ayuda> magnificient
[11:23:00] <sash_> sorry
[11:23:04] <se_bu5ca_ayuda> i dind't think of that
[11:23:10] <sash_> $('.classname')
[11:23:37] <sash_> You need . and # for class and id selectors
[11:24:04] <se_bu5ca_ayuda> i got that
[11:24:07] <se_bu5ca_ayuda> i got buckets of that
[11:24:48] <sash_> se_bu5ca_ayuda: You can use the selectors basically the same way you do in cas
[11:24:51] <sash_> *css
[11:34:52] <happyg> sup jquery
[11:35:02] <arthurvr> sup happyg
[11:36:04] <happyg> im going to call you Art
[11:36:05] <happyg> ok?
[11:44:38] <supremecourt> can any of you lucid dream?
[11:51:37] <TeddyMurray> me
[13:39:53] <kokut> Hello, whats the opposite of :hover? :blur?
[13:41:26] <kokut> I mean, what is the event when an element loses focus/hover ?
[13:43:40] <arthurvr> kokut: you mean mouseleave I guess.
[13:43:51] <arthurvr> kokut: https://api.jquery.com/mouseleave/
[13:44:20] <arthurvr> the hover event is just a shortcut for the mouseenter one
[13:44:29] <arthurvr> you can read about it first sentence of the api docs page.
[13:44:33] <arthurvr> `api hover @ kokut
[13:44:33] <b-ot> kokut: .hover(): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[13:45:28] <kokut> mmh man
[13:45:52] <arthurvr> when losing focus it’s called .blur
[13:45:55] <arthurvr> `api blur
[13:45:55] <b-ot> arthurvr: .blur(): Bind an event handler to the "blur" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/blur/
[14:45:44] <droid909> guys i have a <a> element which has data-id='number here'  i put handler on clicking on that a preventing default behaviour, how do i get data-id value inside that handler?  this.data('id') doesn't seem to work
[14:46:30] <japwagon> z-index scroller
[14:47:06] <japwagon> what day is it
[14:47:24] <droid909> japwagon: sunday
[14:47:58] <japwagon> its saturday goddamn you
[14:48:15] <droid909> sunday here, damn you too
[14:48:31] <japwagon> where the fuck are you, tattoine?
[14:48:37] <droid909> right!
[14:48:52] <droid909> japwagon: now go back to coding!
[14:49:03] <japwagon> phah
[14:49:07] <japwagon> im not ready for that yet D2
[14:49:10] <japwagon> i mean R2
[14:49:14] <japwagon> i mean,R2-D2
[14:49:44] <droid909> ok chu chu
[14:50:07] * japwagon he heh,oh r2 you silly creature
[14:50:55] <droid909> heh smartass
[14:51:33] <japwagon> do you know of a way to make a z-index parralax effect?
[14:52:19] <japwagon> i know drej does but he wont discuss it
[14:54:29] <drej> this is true
[14:57:06] <user_corrupt> I'm doing a $.getJSON to grab some JSON that is output by a PHP file on my server (tested in JSON validator) and sometimes it works, sometimes it does not (in Safari on OSX). Any ideas as to what may be causing this or what a solution could be?
[15:01:10] <japwagon> drej
[15:01:23] <drej> yes, dear
[15:01:41] <japwagon> what the fuck are you even doing right now
[15:01:51] <drej> mostly, existing
[15:02:35] <japwagon> have you ever had a lucid dream?
[15:02:42] <drej> i might be having one right now
[15:02:56] <japwagon> i think there is argument against that
[15:03:05] <japwagon> but i considered that thought today as well
[15:03:52] <japwagon> can you lucidly dream?
[15:05:48] <drej> sometimes
[15:05:52] <drej> it dpends on what day of the week it is
[15:06:12] <japwagon> thats a bullshit answer
[15:06:40] <japwagon> can you do it or not, or rather do you just suggestively say you do when you know clealry you wish,lazily, not to go into what that would actually mena?
[15:06:44] <japwagon> mean*
[15:07:09] <drej> i just dont really care to talk to you
[15:07:15] <drej> one way or another
[15:07:18] <drej> if that makes you feel any better?
[15:07:49] <japwagon> if you wish not to speak why ask questions
[15:27:58] <user_corrupt> so the fact that I can't get $get.JSON to consistently grab some data (JSON validated) has resulted in my just setting a bunch of javascript variables dynamically with PHP and then posting them to a script that inserts them into a DB… on a scale of 1-100, how terrible of a solution is this?
[15:28:08] <hrusti> I have bind event handler  for 'transitionend webkitTransitionEnd MSTransitionEnd' but it still doesnt work in safari. What prefix am I missing?
[15:28:10] <japwagon> about a 45
[15:28:38] <user_corrupt> japwagin: got any other suggestions?
[15:28:46] <japwagon> yup
[15:29:08] <japwagon> use node.js you son of a bitch
[15:29:12] <user_corrupt> heh, ok
[15:29:16] <user_corrupt> thanks
[15:29:55] <japwagon> am i right?
[15:30:08] <japwagon> wait a second
[15:30:32] <japwagon> why are you using php at al
[15:30:41] <japwagon> javascript can do that in one swift move
[15:31:58] <user_corrupt> I have a PHP script creating a facebook session and also a $graphObject, which is the object that I have turned into an array and also JSON output
[15:32:53] <japwagon> what data are u getting from FB
[15:34:14] <user_corrupt> user name, link, email… nothing that users don't agree to providing when they use my app.. I'm not the NSA, I can't force anyone to do anything that is against their will
[15:35:23] <japwagon> hmmm
[15:35:35] <japwagon> why are you getting this data
[15:37:29] <user_corrupt> it's for an app I'm making.. an app that users choose to either use or not use.. for their own entertainment etc.. I need the data to provide a more targetted experience for them
[15:37:56] <user_corrupt> tailored to their entertainment needs...
[15:43:51] <Siphion> @hrusti http://jsfiddle.net/yuud1t6s/ seem to work in Safari :S
[15:45:23] <japwagon> well
[15:45:28] <japwagon> let me consider your proposal
[17:11:08] <_blizzy_> so, I'm appending a div (call it foo) to another div (bar). however, when I try to call a click function on it after I append it, it won't fire.
[17:57:42] <hdon> hi all :) i am trying to use $.get, which i suppose is a convenience wrapper around $.ajax({method:'GET', url:arg0, ...})
[17:57:51] <hdon> here is my code:
[18:00:41] <hdon> https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8828701
[18:00:45] <hdon> and the output is...
[18:01:48] <hdon> http://codebad.com/~hdon/jqueryget.png
[18:02:52] <hdon> i thought the success and error callbacks were supposed to receive some arguments, including the jqXHR object, and i also thought the jqXHR object was supposed to be the return value of the $.get or $.ajax call
[18:03:09] <hdon> anyone have a clue? i'm using jquery 1.11.2
[18:04:44] <cr0mulent> Can someone suggest how I can dynamically add a submit button after the radio buttons are displayed? http://jsfiddle.net/hfs0k2hu/1/
[18:06:35] <hdon> oh my... with my code, it is passing error and success as HTTP GET params
[18:08:21] <hdon> ahh... now i have it working
[18:08:22] <hdon> thanks all
[18:10:58] <hdon> cr0mulent: do you want, each time the user makes a selection, for the subsequent element of allQuestions to be displayed as a new series of radio buttons, until the list is exhausted, and then present the submit button?
[18:11:41] <cr0mulent> hdon: that’s an interesting approach. I would like to try that.
[18:11:53] <cr0mulent> hdon: How do you suggest I do that?
[18:11:55] <hdon> cr0mulent: just adding a submit button is easy. $('<input type="submit" value="Submit"/>').appendTo('form-selector-or-something')
[18:13:26] <cr0mulent> hdon: I”m going to try that
[18:14:31] <cr0mulent> hdon: are you suggesting I add this on line 30? $('<input type="submit" value="Submit"/>').appendTo('.question_choices')
[18:17:19] <flexpaint> http://jsfiddle.net/xg58hm73/1/ how can i make it so when clicked a tag goes to a link
[18:18:29] <mdev> jquery one of the most useful pieces of code written I think
[18:20:58] <flexpaint> something like this? http://www.java2s.com/Code/JavaScript/HTML/Anchorsarray.htm
[18:21:03] <flexpaint> not sure how to apply...
[18:25:49] <hdon> cr0mulent: like this: http://jsfiddle.net/hfs0k2hu/2/
[18:26:06] <hdon> cr0mulent: it's got a few rough edges but i tried changing as little of your code as possible -- ended up changing a lot, but w/e
[18:26:44] <hdon> flexpaint: when you click an a tag, your browser usually follows the href...
[18:26:45] <cr0mulent> Thank you hdon, this gets me somewhere.
[18:27:09] <hdon> cr0mulent: if you need any more support please see my resume and portfolio, i have competitive prices. http://codebad.com/
[18:27:13] <flexpaint> hdon, can i override that to just do a href?
[18:27:35] <hdon> flexpaint: are you trying to use jquery ui?
[18:27:51] <mdev> did 1 guy create jquery/
[18:27:53] <flexpaint> i think so
[18:28:00] <flexpaint> yes
[18:28:02] <flexpaint> i got it from http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[18:28:19] <hdon> flexpaint: i don't think jsfiddle supports jquery ui directly. you have to add it custom, or else find it in the list of "Frameworks and Extensions"
[18:28:30] <hdon> flexpaint: oh i see you did add it already :)
[18:28:32] <flexpaint> i added it in
[18:28:33] <flexpaint> :)
[18:28:34] <hdon> join #jquery-ui
[18:28:41] <flexpaint> oh okay
[18:28:42] <flexpaint> thanks
[18:28:46] <hdon> whoops
[18:28:51] <hdon> flexpaint: did not mean to say that!
[18:29:10] <flexpaint> dead in there haha
[18:29:13] <hdon> flexpaint: i haven't used jquery-ui in like three years so, i wouldn't know anymore
[18:29:20] <flexpaint> ahh gotcha
[18:31:27] <hdon> flexpaint: what behavior did you want exactly? to respond to making a valid selection?
[18:32:13] <flexpaint> i just want it so when you click say actionscript it goes to foo.com, applescript foo2.com etc
[18:32:27] <flexpaint> while keeping the autocomplete functionality
[18:32:57] <hdon> flexpaint: ok if you specifically CLICK on it, there is an option for you
[18:32:59] <hdon> one sec
[18:33:18] <flexpaint> okay great
[18:33:42] <flexpaint> pressing enter doesn't seem to complete the search anyway
[18:38:36] <hdon> flexpaint: do you ever read the jquery ui source code?
[18:38:58] <hdon> flexpaint: you really should. for me it was the best way to learn how to jquery ui. it's made to be extended and modified and hacked in every way.
[18:39:29] <hdon> flexpaint: i've gotta run unfortunately but find the code for autocomplete and look for "select" to find the select handler and "change" to find the change handler. also check out the docs at https://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[18:39:43] <flexpaint> hdon, this is my first time using it. it seems cool though, this autocomplete solution is the only one supported in ie11 that i could find
[18:40:00] <flexpaint> okay thanks
[20:48:22] <Rainb> is :not the only pseudoclass that takes a selector as an argument
[21:05:40] <Zeranoe> is there any workaround for cross domain restrictions for detecting when a window.open is done loading? example being: window "A" opens a "B" window with a url from a different domain, and when the "B" window is done loading, the "A" window runs a window.close()
[21:08:08] <mdev> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3291712/is-it-possible-to-open-a-popup-with-javascript-and-then-detect-when-the-user-clo
[21:08:11] <mdev> maybe that'll help
[21:08:27] <mdev> "This won't work cross browser. You need to handle the unload event in the pop-up"
[21:21:49] <igcewieling> Is it worth checking for visibility before hiding an element or should I be unconditionally hide the elements?
[21:23:00] <mdev> depends on your goals
[21:23:07] <mdev> but probably should just hide all the elements
[21:23:20] <mdev> blindly hide em, less cpu cycles used
[21:23:37] <igcewieling> thanks.
[23:29:35] <sadtaco> <div class="container"><div class="foo" /><div class="bar" /><div class="bar" /><div class="foo" /><div class="bar" /></div>  How do I select the first two .bar?  IE, how do I sibling an element and all of its siblings that are that class until the next sibling isn't the same class?
[23:30:15] <sadtaco> I can do it with filter but, eeh odd looking
