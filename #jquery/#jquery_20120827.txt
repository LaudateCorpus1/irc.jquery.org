[00:20:07] <PlasmaBunny> hi
[00:20:27] <PlasmaBunny> what is the optimal way to spawn synapses between different level neuro blocks?
[00:20:47] <PlasmaBunny> i.e. data arrives to level 0 neuro blocks ("senses" blocks)
[00:21:00] <PlasmaBunny> they then must generate level 1 neuro blocks with synapses to level 0
[00:21:17] <PlasmaBunny> what is the best algorithm of doing that?
[00:21:53] <coldhead> i think you might be looking for #brainQuery
[00:22:06] <PlasmaBunny> coldhead: lol
[00:22:13] <coldhead> this is #jQuery, the library voted least useful to brain modelling
[00:23:12] <PlasmaBunny> do you have link to this 'vote'?
[00:33:17] <Koopz> can someone help me with my combobox?
[00:38:38] <Cork> ?ask @ Koopz
[00:38:38] <bot-t> Koopz, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:38:54] <astropirate> Koopz, no. we hate  you
[00:43:30] <mosasaur> I can rotate an image, however I'd like to fix the center, rotate around a pivot point. Is this possible?
[00:45:02] <Cork> mosasaur: sure, the transform css rule can offset the center
[00:46:01] <Koopz> http://jsfiddle.net/SPkgN <- my Input doesn't set the label as value
[00:46:24] <mosasaur> thanks cork, so I have to put this in the css, not in jquery?
[00:46:39] <Cork> mosasaur: you can't rotate an image without css
[00:47:08] <mosasaur> Cork: but I just did that with jqueryrotate!
[00:47:18] <Cork> have you checked what it does? :)
[00:47:50] <mosasaur> ah, so there's css behind the curtains :-)
[00:47:56] <Cork> exactly
[00:48:14] <mosasaur> thanks, I get it now
[00:56:11] <Koopz> http://jsfiddle.net/SPkgN <- my Input doesn't set the label as value...what somehow is surprising me because thats the normal bevahiour of it...but somehow it doesn't work with Remote Sources
[00:57:46] <Cork> Koopz: your code snippet has php code in it
[00:58:11] <Cork> Koopz: anyway have you tries adding debug code in the select callback to see what data you get there?
[00:59:23] <Cork> Koopz: additionally you might have problem with that input is not declared in the callback (cause its declared in the same statement)
[01:00:15] <Koopz> http://jsfiddle.net/SPkgN/1/
[01:01:33] <Koopz> already tried giving it an ID and working with that...but i got the same result...it continues using the value instead of the label...
[01:04:38] <Cork> Koopz: http://jsfiddle.net/SPkgN/2/
[01:05:17] <Cork> Koopz: select runs before autocomplete sets the new value in the field
[01:05:29] <Cork> so you need to delay your call so autocomplete is done first
[01:05:43] <Koopz> ...durrr...
[01:06:59] <Cork> Koopz: wait a sec
[01:07:04] <Cork> theres a better option
[01:07:42] <Cork> Koopz: http://jsfiddle.net/SPkgN/3/
[01:08:45] <Koopz> works like a charm...
[01:09:00] <Koopz> thanks for the help
[01:09:29] <Cork> np
[01:09:48] <Cork> its stated in the ui docs for autocomplete
[01:11:41] <Koopz> it is?
[01:11:50] <r5001> how do i get ids of checked nodes on click event of a node http://luban.danse.us/jazzclub/javascripts/jquery/jsTree/reference/_examples/4_themes.html
[01:11:58] <r5001> for js tree
[01:16:44] <Cork> Koopz: check in the events tab under select
[01:17:07] <Zamolxe> what is the best way to register a plugin directly like $.greatPlugin() ?
[01:17:26] <Cork> Koopz: "The default action of select is to replace the text field's value with the value of the selected item. Canceling this event prevents the value from being updated, but does not prevent the menu from closing."
[01:17:37] <hanitavssl> Hi to all
[01:18:07] <Koopz> Cork: wow im blind...
[01:18:19] <hanitavssl> i need simple sign up form,can any one help me?
[01:18:21] <Cork> Zamolxe: you mean $.plugin_name or $(selector).plugin_name ?
[01:18:30] <Cork> ?ask @ hanitavssl
[01:18:30] <bot-t> hanitavssl, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:18:53] <Zamolxe> Cork: my plugin is an utility, does not depend on a selector. I mean $.plugin_name
[01:19:11] <Cork> ok then you add it directly to jQuery or $
[01:19:23] <Cork> $.my_plugin = function() {};
[01:19:32] <Zamolxe> understood
[01:19:57] <r5001> seutje:  hi  i tried to  get id  on select using this code, but not working       callback: {            onselect: function(node, jstree) {   var id = $(node).attr("id").split("_")[1];   alert("Great"+id);            }
[01:20:43] <r5001> any idea how do i get ids of all selected node on click of a node event
[01:20:53] <seutje> I'm gone for like a week and this is how I get greeted? o.O
[01:20:53] <r5001> http://luban.danse.us/jazzclub/javascripts/jquery/jsTree/reference/_examples/4_themes.html
[01:21:07] <r5001> seutje:  awww :p
[01:23:42] <Zamolxe> Cork: couple of months ago I've created a jQuery plugin https://gitorious.org/jquery-kinotice/jquery-kinotice/blobs/master/jquery.kinotice.js can you tell me where I can find some good plugin development patterns so I can improve the code
[01:24:34] <Cork> Zamolxe: not off hand no
[01:32:11] <eirikb> Any way to make .animate({marginLeft: 'toggle'}) to not hide? Here is a demo that fails, I don't want the paragraph to be hidden: http://jsfiddle.net/AXesP also I don't control the CSS or markup, only the script
[01:46:22] <subhojit777> I am using scrollTop() to scroll within a div. I have written a code such that on pressing arrow keys user can scroll through the div. But the scrollTop is not working there. Is there any kind of CSS property that can hinder the working of scrollTop()?
[01:47:59] <se-lite_> subhojit777: you got a sample code for this?
[01:49:49] <subhojit777> yes
[01:50:09] <subhojit777> u want to see the code se-lite_ ?
[01:55:06] <gob> subhojit777: jsfiddle it. always.
[02:11:40] <subhojit777> se-lite_, gob here is the code http://jsfiddle.net/dEdQW/2/ I am creating the same div in another part of the same page. The difference is right and top property is not there for that div. There the scrolling is working fine. I have tried after removing right and top property but still scrolling is not working.
[02:11:58] <Pitel_laptop> how come $("<p>").html() is empty string? I expected "<p></p>".
[02:12:29] <se-lite_> Pitel_laptop: because its the content of <p>
[02:12:42] <Pitel_laptop> oh, i see...
[02:13:02] <gob> right and top are position properties, they affect the location of the div, but not it's scroll
[02:16:04] <gob> .offset() is the same deal. It refers to it's external position
[02:17:25] <subhojit777> gob, yes is my code alright?
[02:18:12] <gob> http://jsfiddle.net/cdhTV/
[02:20:23] <mazzachre> When using hoverIntent, can I trigger an "out" event myself? I have a problem where "out" is not triggered if a jqueryUI window widget is opened in modal mode and then hidden again.
[02:20:58] <gob> $('.stuff').trigger('out');
[02:21:29] <majd> hey #jquery - does anyone know of a good algorithm (jquery or javascript), to calculate fiscal years, give a start date?
[02:21:31] <mazzachre> oh, that simple..
[02:22:50] <ordinaryman09> any1 know how to use images on different devices on different resolution?
[02:23:13] <se-lite_> subhojit777: http://jsfiddle.net/cdhTV/3/ can scroll to a given element i guess.. not sure what you want tho :p
[02:26:30] <subhojit777> se-lite_, on arrow key press user can scroll through the list
[02:28:09] <se-lite_> subhojit777: you don't need scrolltop for that?
[02:28:44] <subhojit777> why?
[02:29:52] <se-lite_> subhojit777: a scrolled div with focus will automaticly scroll on arrow keys
[02:30:24] <subhojit777> ok.. got it
[02:31:18] <subhojit777> well I guess I have found solution in ur code. I will try out ur code
[02:45:48] <badoskie> Hello all
[02:55:11] <mugsie> o/
[03:05:41] <notafrog> Is there a way to fetch all data set in html attribute? Using .data() on element like <div data="{foo:'bar'}"></div> doesn't seem to return the object defined in the data-attribute.
[03:07:08] <Sicp> so I want to make an HTML element disappear when something happens, I can't just add attr("type","hidden") and expect it to disappear, I need to prompt the page to refresh or something
[03:21:27] <Ghosss> :q
[03:35:21] <Christer_> Does jQuery implement any way of accessing custom attributes?
[03:40:16] <seutje> Christer_: .attr()?
[03:55:06] <Christer_> seutje: .data() :)
[03:55:32] <seutje> those are cached afaik
[04:39:14] <Gandalf84> How can I add all the content of a query object in a div?
[04:39:41] <Gandalf84> <div id="root"><label></label><img ../></div>
[04:40:08] <Gandalf84> I want to add a wrapper div after #root, that will contains label and img
[04:40:17] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/y64yscfjwgaf2lsvxqdq - I have a problem here, the form is appearing as I click the "#add-customerorderer", then I click cancel and it dissapears, everything good thus far, however, clicking the "#add-customerorderer" again just hides the button, it doesn't show the form again...
[04:40:43] <johnkpaul> ?wrapInner @Gandalf84
[04:40:44] <bot-t> Gandalf84, .wrapInner(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around the content of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrapInner/
[04:41:03] <Gandalf84> thank u :D
[04:41:09] <johnkpaul> no problem, have fun!
[04:42:53] <Gandalf84> but in my case I have to do something like $('.class').wrapInner($('#root').children())
[04:42:56] <Gandalf84> is it correct?
[04:44:41] <Gandalf84> no
[04:44:51] <Gandalf84> $('.class').wrapInner($('#root'))
[04:46:07] <johnkpaul> no Gandalf84, $("#root").wrapInner(".className") will give you <div id=root><div class="className"><label><img></div></div>
[04:46:24] <Gandalf84> thank you :D
[04:47:55] <nisseni> someone talked about event last time I stated the question
[04:49:14] <shoky> nisseni: you dropped some php in your jquery
[04:49:29] <nisseni> shoky: yes I did...
[04:49:36] <shoky> suggestion: DONT
[04:50:05] <nisseni> shoky: is that why it doesn't work?
[04:50:06] <shoky> except MAYBE one line at the top like var stuff = <?php echo whatever?>;
[04:50:20] <shoky> nisseni: i have no idea what your php is outputting..
[04:53:10] <teeher> http://villageconcierge.net <- Why won't my jQuery work. I have tried everything load Jquery locally, off Google. Error in Firebug console: ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined. I have tried $, jQuery, and noconflict with no luck :( pls help thanks stuck for last 2 hrs
[04:53:47] <nisseni> shoky: the php renders the form..
[04:54:13] <shoky> teeher: you need to include jquery _before_ using i
[04:54:15] <shoky> it
[04:54:38] <shoky> actually
[04:55:11] <teeher> thanks I got it working
[04:55:22] <teeher> <?php wp_enqueue_script("jquery"); ?> <- My WordPress Jquery wasn't loading before my code
[04:55:26] <teeher> :))))))
[04:56:08] <nisseni> shoky: doesn't make a different if it's in php or html
[04:56:59] <shoky> nisseni: it makes a difference to someone like me who doesn't know php or what $this is, etc.
[04:57:06] <xec_> ?demo @ nisseni
[04:57:06] <bot-t> nisseni, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:57:08] <shoky> nisseni: and also because it's ugly
[04:57:21] <shoky> nisseni: also, you're appending a NEW form each time
[04:57:27] <shoky> nisseni: so the old form is still there
[04:58:33] <xec_> nisseni: if you are able to make a php-free demonstration of your issue, it's going to be a lot easier to help you.
[04:59:01] <nisseni> will try
[04:59:12] <shoky> did you see the last thing i said?
[04:59:15] <shoky> make sense?
[05:00:34] <nisseni> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/4JcqK/
[05:00:47] <nisseni> shoky: yes, sorry, it's only a form rendered from php
[05:00:58] <nisseni> the code, according to me, gets a lot cleaner...
[05:01:24] <nisseni> well, the jsfiddle doesn't work at all
[05:02:04] <xec_> nisseni: choose jquery as the framework on the left
[05:02:06] <nisseni> ah, wrong lib loaded - http://jsfiddle.net/4JcqK/1/
[05:02:17] <nisseni> xec_: yeah, noticed :)
[05:03:09] <nisseni> see my issue?
[05:03:18] <xec_> nisseni: so how is it supposed to behave? a list that you can add to (i.e. new form)? or just show/hide the one form
[05:03:39] <nisseni> xec_: show / hide that one form
[05:04:24] <xec_> nisseni: ok, then i suggest you attach it to the dom outside the click handler, and let the click handler just toggle it
[05:05:00] <nisseni> xec_: I see, I tried making a variable from it, but I guess that'w quite wrong... ?
[05:05:13] <shoky> nisseni: you're doing .hide on #customerorderers
[05:05:23] <shoky> nisseni: but then you're not showing it again..
[05:05:32] <xec_> nisseni: no a var is a good idea
[05:05:54] <xec_> shoky: the .show() is in a callbacks callback -.-
[05:06:23] <shoky> that shows the button, not the div
[05:06:25] <nezuvian> hi guys! can someone tell me, how to toggle the checked state of radio buttons with jquery?
[05:06:42] <shoky> and the slideDown is on the form, not the div
[05:06:50] <shoky> so, no showing of the div after its hidden.
[05:06:51] <xec_> right
[05:07:28] <se-lite_> nezuvian: google got lots of answers to that
[05:08:24] <shoky> nisseni: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/4JcqK/3/
[05:08:48] <nezuvian> se-lite_: well, if you can give me a link that would be fine too, because i tried to google it but came up with nothing useful, thats why i'm asking here
[05:09:43] <xec_> shoky: still not great, click handler inside click handler xD
[05:09:54] <shoky> ah right didn't notice that :P
[05:10:00] <se-lite_> nezuvian: https://www.google.no/search?q=jquery+check+checkbox&sugexp=chrome,mod=17&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
[05:10:36] <xec_> i just moved it outside http://jsfiddle.net/4JcqK/4/
[05:11:33] <xec_> nisseni:  ^
[05:11:40] <nisseni> thanks a lot
[05:11:44] <nisseni> real helpful
[05:12:05] <nisseni> I wonder, I think it would be a good idea to kinda disable the form if it's hidden...
[05:12:21] <nezuvian> se-lite_: thx for the help
[05:12:24] <nisseni> so that a save from another form on the page doesn't save a hidden form
[05:12:55] <xec_> nisseni: what makes you think it would interfere with another form?
[05:13:18] <nisseni> xec_: gonna test it out
[05:13:34] <xec_> i think it should be fine
[05:22:07] <Viliasas> Hello, might someone know how I could make jQuery click event to work on Android without jQuery Mobile?
[05:24:43] <nisseni> xec_: works fine, thanks! :)
[05:27:33] <rwparri2> what is more efficient, a simple selector or a more complex one?
[05:28:56] <xec_> rwparri2: really depends on the specific use case, test them and see - but usually simpler is better
[05:29:34] <rwparri2> xec_, how would I test the speed of that?
[05:29:37] <xec_> rwparri2: also, the selector is rarely the bottleneck of your app
[05:30:01] <xec_> rwparri2: you could give jsperf.com a whirl
[05:30:41] <rwparri2> xec_, thanks
[05:34:06] <xec_> rwparri2: before you spend too much time on optimizing selectors, have a look at http://paulirish.com/2009/perf/ if you're worried about performance
[05:42:48] <ven0m> Hey. I've wrote a simple test case: Jquery is loaded, ready event is defined. For some reason though, the example works in all browsers, besides Opera. The ready callback does not get called. http://jsfiddle.net/rsFjE/
[05:48:16] <Hooloovoo> ven0m: what are you trying to do?
[05:50:40] <ven0m> I am trying to download jQuery on the fly
[05:50:46] <ven0m> once its done to some initializing
[05:51:06] <ven0m> I know it looks a bit odd, but this a test case, so its simplified and alot of stuff is missing
[05:51:20] <xec_> ven0m: why is the docready inside a function?
[05:51:50] <shoky> that shouldn't matter, it's fine to put it in a function
[05:51:58] <ven0m> Exactly
[05:52:05] <ven0m> i found the cause though:
[05:52:22] <ven0m> if i exchange script.onload = function()...
[05:52:30] <ven0m> with script.onload = tiyug_zone_1402;
[05:52:36] <ven0m> everything works just fine
[05:52:49] <shoky> ven0m since you included jquery in jsfiddle it works fine for me in opera..
[05:52:55] <shoky> i get the alert
[05:53:18] <ven0m> Oh. sorry about that. Let me edit it
[05:53:38] <DarsVaeda> what is better and why?: http://pastebin.com/bqHT9HKC
[05:54:46] <shoky> DarsVaeda: usually the first one is better. but that's only in case #foo is a static element that isn't removed/added at runtime
[05:54:54] <ven0m> http://jsfiddle.net/wCzGF/
[05:55:00] <ven0m> HEre it is
[05:55:14] <DarsVaeda> shoky: okay thanks
[05:55:18] <shoky> DarsVaeda: and it's because in the second one you're creating a new jquery object and querying the DOM on each function call
[05:55:55] <DarsVaeda> thanks :)
[05:59:36] <ven0m> shoky, have you seen the new example i've posted?
[06:00:19] <shoky> ven0m: why are you using jquery 1.2.6 :\
[06:01:15] <ven0m> SOrry. thats not up to me :X
[06:01:30] <ven0m> I took over a product, already in production
[06:01:40] <shoky> well anyway, you said you found a solution, no?
[06:01:54] <ven0m> Yeah, but the timeout we have there is there for a reason
[06:01:58] <shoky> if you took it over, how is it not up to you ;P
[06:02:03] <ven0m> to solve another synchronization problem we had
[06:02:12] <shoky> sounds bad ;]
[06:02:23] <ven0m> Shoky - i have a wierd product manager running the whole thing :X
[06:02:38] <ven0m> the sync problem is (again) opera related
[06:02:40] <LordThumper> Is script inside a hidden (display: none;) div executed?
[06:02:50] <ven0m> no
[06:03:31] <ven0m> the test case i've put up is just an empty html document with JS
[06:05:14] <xec_> LordThumper: yes
[06:05:40] <xec_> LordThumper: but don't take my word for it, this is really easy to test for yourself, no? :)
[06:08:48] <ven0m> any idea guys?
[06:09:10] <pachet> what was the question, sorry?
[06:09:12] <pachet> i joined late :[
[06:10:39] <ven0m> http://jsfiddle.net/wCzGF/
[06:10:45] <shoky> ven0m: it doesnt work for me when i do script.onload = tiyug_zone_1402;
[06:10:53] <ven0m> for some reason the ready event wont fire in Opera
[06:11:19] <pachet> good lord, an alert in a resize handler
[06:11:27] <pachet> :[
[06:11:42] <shoky> pachet: and jquery 1.2.6 ..
[06:12:16] <xec_> i don't get an alert in firefox either
[06:12:16] <lobbin> Can I write this in a better way? .find( ":jqmData(role=content)").children().first()
[06:12:16] <pachet> shoky: yeah
[06:12:28] <pachet> i get an alert :[
[06:12:36] <pachet> jsfiddle.net/u3zLm
[06:12:46] <pachet> updated jquery though
[06:12:53] <pachet> or is that not allowed :[
[06:12:56] <shoky> it's not :(
[06:13:10] <shoky> the script loads jquery in a new script tag
[06:13:19] <ven0m> shoky, wierd, stoppped working for me too
[06:14:24] <ven0m> snoky, it does work on an actual page
[06:14:44] <ven0m> if you take the script, place it in separate JS and include it in an empty HTML - works just fine
[06:15:28] <shoky> obviously..?
[06:15:58] <ven0m> obviously what?
[06:16:17] <shoky> sorry, misread
[06:17:27] <futini> hello
[06:17:34] <futini> i have a problem
[06:18:15] <futini> i have a list whit float left, and i need animate to the left and right, but i need a equal distances in animate
[06:18:19] <futini> and in firefox its work ok
[06:18:23] <futini> in chrome is not ok
[06:18:28] <futini> you can see the example here
[06:18:35] <futini> http://jsfiddle.net/ZBUNn/3/
[06:19:26] <futini> you can see in chrome if i move to the right one time, and then i move to left,  dont come to the original position
[06:19:33] <futini> but un firefox
[06:19:44] <futini> but in firefox yes
[06:22:16] <shoky> ven0m: anyway it works fine with newer jquery. (and if you don't use strings in your setTimeout call..)
[06:22:52] <shoky> ven0m: http://jsfiddle.net/wCzGF/3/
[06:23:28] <qom2> having some trouble with jCrop, anyone implemented it? http://jsbin.com/aqixiv/3 – trying to get the actual selected crop area to be shown in the preview, but I just get "c is undefined"
[06:23:48] <ven0m> Cool
[06:23:53] <ven0m> shoky thanks alot
[06:23:56] <ven0m> appriciate it
[06:24:08] <shoky> np
[06:24:25] <ven0m> i guess i need to increase my effort to make them upgrade the JQ
[06:24:57] <alaing> Any idea why I'm getting a "TypeError: a is null" error after doing $.ajax my ajax call is returning data from my server. The response is astring in JSON format which I later use $.parseJSON
[06:25:06] <shoky> futini: i don't see any difference.. again
[06:25:58] <shoky> ?p @ alaing
[06:25:59] <bot-t> alaing, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:26:03] <futini> wonder :/
[06:26:28] <Gandalf84> is there a way to take all the elements with id starting with a string and ending with another one? something like $('start*end') ?
[06:26:42] <Gandalf84> where using the asterisk is like in unix shell
[06:27:09] <alaing> shoky I'm not sure how to get jsfiddle to to do all the ajax calls etc because my site is on a local intranet
[06:27:54] <futini> shoky, i check and is my browser
[06:27:59] <shoky> alaing: you can put dummy data (with a timeout if you want, to keep it async) instead of ajax calls
[06:28:01] <futini> something happend whit my browser
[06:28:02] <futini> thanks
[06:28:21] <shoky> alaing: or just pastebin your code
[06:28:22] <alaing> I'll pastebin it for the meantime?
[06:28:48] <alaing> I'll paste an example of the response as well
[06:29:22] <shoky> werd
[06:30:11] <LordThumper> Gandalf84:
[06:30:19] <LordThumper> $("*[id^='start'][id$='end']")
[06:30:22] <LordThumper> Somethign like that?
[06:30:26] <LordThumper> Something*
[06:30:58] <shoky> poor DOM
[06:31:34] <shoky> LordThumper in case you were interested about that "webkit bug" i was asking about with the css-transform,
[06:31:54] <LordThumper> Ah did you find the problem?
[06:32:03] <shoky> it's indeed a bug, but see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12126254/chrome-css-transform-issue-element-in-front-of-rotated-element-doesnt-respond
[06:32:10] <shoky> someone gave me a good answer
[06:32:52] <shoky> so i was able to fix the issue. too bad webkit & firefox didn't show that
[06:33:04] <LordThumper> Ah nice
[06:35:17] <shoky> that is, chrome and firefox
[06:35:47] <LordThumper> Does Safari Webkit render it different from Chrome Webkit?
[06:35:54] <LordThumper> I would assume they would be exactly the same
[06:36:48] <djsounds02> Hey guys, on this page my images slide down but how do I get them to stay down whilst my customer click the links behind it?
[06:36:50] <djsounds02> http://alpha360test.co.uk/bangle_box/product-category/category-1/
[06:37:58] <djsounds02> false alarn sorted it now thankyou
[06:38:29] <alaing> http://pastebin.com/FXXSh8D1 I'm getting a "TypeError: a is null" error even though I'm getting a response back from the server
[06:40:00] <shoky> LordThumper: yeah they're apparently different.. donno
[06:41:51] <shoky> alaing: ajax is asynchronous. $.ajax returns immediately, before the success callback is called, you'll always be returning an empty string
[06:42:51] <shoky> alaing: also, you have 'dateType' instead of 'dataType' . but if you fix that so that your dataType is actually 'json', then you should not call parseJSON on the returned data.
[06:43:08] <shoky> ?ajax101 @ alaing
[06:43:08] <alaing> I see, so shoudl I move the $.ajax inside the source"option of the autocomplete
[06:43:09] <bot-t> alaing, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[06:44:01] <shoky> alaing: one simple thing you could do is pass that 'response' argument as an argument to your getUsersData function
[06:44:17] <shoky> alaing: and then in the success callback you do request(data)  or something
[06:44:31] <alaing> shoky: by setting the dataType does it look for a json header in the response?
[06:45:25] <alaing> or does it simply process the data as json for you?
[06:45:48] <shoky> alaing: it simply processes it for you
[06:45:56] <alaing> thanks
[06:46:03] <shoky> alaing but let me show you a nicer way to deal with it
[06:46:05] <shoky> sec
[06:47:26] <alaing> so in the "source" option I should call my getUsersData and pass in the 'response'. Its not really needed as I pick out the response and pass it to the  server in the "data" option.
[06:47:47] <alaing> Ok, if you dont mind I would love to see you suggestion
[06:47:54] <shoky> alaing: http://pastebin.com/1bss2M2T
[06:48:23] <shoky> oops
[06:48:37] <shoky> sorry i accidentally named that var request but the argument is request also
[06:48:41] <shoky> let me fix that
[06:48:47] <gyzmodo> hello guys
[06:48:54] <gyzmodo> i've this script: http://jsfiddle.net/KRmJG/
[06:49:09] <shoky> alaing: http://pastebin.com/27PQEj43
[06:49:38] <gyzmodo> it works like a charm when i am testin on index.html, but when i am testing on server, it doesnt work
[06:49:55] <alaing> shoky: That is neat!!!!
[06:50:08] <gyzmodo> any ideas?
[06:50:14] <shoky> alaing: ;]
[06:50:30] <alaing> shoky: I'll need to look up .done. Cant say I use it but I see it could be really useful
[06:51:16] <shoky> alaing: in this context, .done  is exactly like the success handler. it's a function that is passed the data argument
[06:51:54] <alaing> shoky let me give that a bash and see if that work.....thank you for yoru time and your example. I've learnt something new today :-D
[06:53:54] <shoky> alaing: .done is part of the Deferreds API that jquery has, which generally deals with asynchronous stuff and callbacks upon success/failure. so ajax is a classic example of something async, and it uses the deferreds API
[06:54:19] <djsounds02> hey guys on an animate function if I got some content to slide up over an image I have to use bottom -40px.. what if that content that slides is say 60px on one instance and 50px on another instance how do I make it dynamic?
[06:54:40] <djsounds02> http://www.yootheme.com/widgetkit/examples/spotlight    Second one in is what I mean on the spotlight demo
[06:54:43] <se-lite_> djsounds02: check the element size?
[06:55:01] <shoky> alaing: that is, jquery's ajax implementation uses the deferreds api ;P
[06:55:24] <djsounds02> se-lite_: do you mean get jquery to check it?
[06:55:47] <se-lite_> djsounds02: i guess so?
[06:56:03] <djsounds02> what function would that be? I'm a complete n00b
[06:57:20] <se-lite_> djsounds02: $(element).height()
[06:59:10] <mariuscc> does anyone know any browser plugin which would show transfer rate for all components of a page ?
[07:06:15] <zuloyd> hi
[07:06:31] <zuloyd> I am looking for a jquery slider like this: http://www.bxslider.com/examples/display-move-multiple-slides-once-example-one
[07:06:36] <zuloyd> but with a "3d effect"
[07:06:48] <zuloyd> i.e. the slides on the left and the right are a little bit smaller than the middle one
[07:09:32] <djsounds02> se-lite_: http://jsfiddle.net/bTSNE/ this height thing isnt working
[07:12:10] <djsounds02> se-lite_: are you there bud?
[07:13:09] <se-lite_> djsounds02: you don't have any html there...
[07:18:10] <djsounds02> se-lite_: what do you mean?
[07:18:31] <djsounds02> oh on the fiddle yeah I know, its just the jquery I needed a help with
[07:26:26] <djsounds02> anybody help me with getting a height and putting it into an animate function
[07:27:15] <alaing> Hi I want to run a funtion if my text field that is using autocomplete loses focues and the user has not selected an option that appears as part of the autocomplete. what event should I use?  I was thinking onblur but I thought this might be called when a user is selecting an option in the autocomplete list
[07:27:48] <alaing> thanks shoky that ajax request is working now, thank you once again
[07:28:13] <djsounds02> se-lite_: I have added a piece of code here http://jsfiddle.net/bTSNE/1/
[07:29:13] <se-lite_> djsounds02: where does the h variable come from?
[07:29:18] <mobedigg> Hello, how can I get File object from input type="file" like this http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/#toc-reading-files instead using evt.target.files; use jquery?
[07:29:37] <djsounds02> se-lite_: I dont know I saw it on te jQuery website, thats the part I don't know how to do
[07:30:01] <se-lite_> djsounds02: i guess you're kind of starting in the wrong end here.. you should first learn the basics about programming..
[07:30:36] <djsounds02> se-lite_: I am learning, but I sorta cant learn the whole language in the middle of a project? :(
[07:30:47] <se-lite_> djsounds02: a project?
[07:30:59] <djsounds02> se-lite_: Yeah
[07:31:13] <djsounds02> se-lite_: http://alpha360test.co.uk/bangle_box/product-category/category-1/
[07:33:40] <elgreg> mariuscc: can you just use the Developer Tools in Chrome or Firebug's Net tab in Firefox?
[07:34:33] <mariuscc> elgreg yeah but I don't see download speed just size and time spent, I was wondering if exists somethign which gives the results directly
[07:36:29] <djsounds02> se-lite_: What do you think can you help out?
[07:39:38] <elgreg> mariuscc: Other than doing some quick math on the Time and Size in the Net stats, maybe look at YSlow or Page Speed plugins.
[07:40:19] <mariuscc> yeah already did that none gives speed. I'll make the math :D
[07:40:48] <christophler> Hello. This must be a very obvious question, I think, Ive just created a jquery ui widget. The widget loads, and the _create method runs. At some point another function I have defined "_addSelectElement" is called. I can see the function in firebug, but actually the function is undefined. Completely baffled
[07:41:19] <se-lite_> christophler: got an url for this behavior?
[07:41:20] <shoky> christophler: what do you mean?
[07:41:35] <shoky> you defined it, you can see it, but actually its undefined. wha?
[07:41:37] <squeakytoy> Hey all. there are methods like parent() and children(), but are there any selector-methods for elements on the same level?
[07:41:39] <Jon47> christophler: the function is undefined, or it returns undefined?
[07:41:48] <christophler> hmm
[07:41:58] <appel> I have a bit of a problem using $.when(). I have multiple ajax queries I'm passing into it, but if one fails before the others have finished then the $.when() will resolve itself. This is not what I want, I want all to finish and the results from all of the deferreds to be passed into the handler
[07:42:00] <se-lite_> squeakytoy: sibling?
[07:42:01] <christophler> Ill try and make the url public
[07:42:21] <squeakytoy> se-lite_, kewl
[07:43:15] <djsounds02> I still cant get this height thing to work :(
[07:43:20] <christophler> se-lite_: http://cms.itosda.org/node/151/round-tables/2 this is the URL, should load, I disabled the access checking for that page
[07:43:37] <christophler> then im running, in firebug console, two lines:
[07:43:57] <christophler> f = jQuery("#delegate-select-roundtable-form")
[07:44:07] <christophler> f.priority_managed_select_group();
[07:44:24] <christophler> the console throws the error "_addSelectElement" is not a function
[07:45:02] <christophler> if you navigate the widget, the property is there, afaict
[07:45:34] <christophler> but tab completion shows its not there (the widget itself I have stored in itosdaObject.logWidget)
[07:46:13] <christophler> Seems to me Im using the wrong name for the widget object. But im using "this._addSelectElement", as per like 1000000 times in the source
[07:46:24] <shoky> umm
[07:46:27] <shoky> where is your widget?
[07:46:39] <christophler> where what how?
[07:46:48] <shoky> and jQuery("#delegate-select-roundtable-form")  returns an empty set..
[07:47:16] <shoky> is it supposed to say 'site under maintenance' ?
[07:47:20] <christophler> nope
[07:47:23] <christophler> sorry, hang on
[07:47:24] <shoky> o.
[07:47:55] <appel> Can I make .$when() only invoke .then when all passed defereds are resolved?
[07:48:35] <christophler> ok, Ive un maintenanced it
[07:49:02] <christophler> oh balls
[07:49:03] <shoky> ok, it says im not logged in
[07:49:07] <christophler> yep
[07:49:33] <ajpiano> the scope is changing
[07:49:37] <ajpiano> cause you're in an event handler
[07:49:40] <ajpiano> in all likelihood
[07:51:45] <christophler> shoky: actually, the page content is there, its just underneath the access denied bit
[07:52:25] <ajpiano> christophler: check what 'this' is in your event handler, and if it isn't what you expect, use see ?$proxy to fix it
[07:52:26] <bot-t> ajpiano, Couldn't find "$proxy" in jQuery Docs.
[07:52:43] <ajpiano> ?proxy
[07:52:44] <bot-t> jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[07:53:00] <shoky> christophler: can't find any 'priority_managed_select_group' in your code
[07:53:00] <christophler> ajpiano: okay...
[07:53:32] <christophler> shoky: there isnt one... Ive been adding the widget by the console
[07:53:48] <christophler> I can add the code to the template fi you like, hang on a tick
[07:53:52] <shoky> uh k
[07:54:04] <christophler> f = jQuery("#delegate-select-roundtable-form")
[07:54:09] <christophler> f.priority_managed_select_group();
[07:54:14] <shoky> yeah you said that already
[07:55:56] <christophler> yep!
[07:56:27] <shoky> that doesn't add a widget by itself, you know..
[07:56:38] <christophler> really?
[07:56:49] <shoky> o.o
[07:57:03] <christophler> :D
[07:57:18] <christophler> well that might be why I have no idea what is goign on then
[07:58:00] <shoky> i dont understand.. you thought that calling f.priority_managed_select_group();   would magically create some widget, even though you didnt define any such widget anywhere?
[07:58:26] <christophler> shoky: http://pastebin.com/cgDNDvuD my whole widget code:
[07:58:33] <christophler> the widget is there, the code runs
[07:58:52] <christophler> Ive also added the "add the widget" code to document.ready so the error appears imediaetely in the console
[07:59:51] <xec_> christophler: i'm getting another error than you: "priority_managed_select_group is not a function" -- so it appears whatever it is, it is not loaded
[08:00:08] <christophler> yep, thats the one
[08:00:32] <xec_> christophler: earlier you stated you got "_addSelectElement is not a function"
[08:00:36] <shoky> christophler: don't do   you want this._addSelectElement
[08:00:45] <shoky> er minus the dont do
[08:00:59] <shoky> christophler: don't do var self = $(this);  that is so confusing
[08:01:12] <christophler> shoky: yeah, I thought it was a pita
[08:01:31] <shoky> also 'this' is not an element
[08:01:36] <christophler> ok
[08:01:37] <shoky> var self = this;   plz
[08:01:43] <christophler> ok
[08:02:06] <shoky> see if that works.. i didnt look at the rest of the code
[08:02:08] <christophler> Im assuming thats to work around variable name "passing through annonymous functions"
[08:02:40] <shoky> yes.. doesnt matter if they're anonymous or not
[08:02:53] <rickdrink> hey there
[08:03:01] <christophler> the thing is, itosdaObject.logWidget contains a reference to the exact same object as _addSelectElement is called on, and if you browse that object in Firebug, it has a function _addSelectElement
[08:03:23] <shoky> christophler: er forget what i said about this._addSelectElement
[08:03:28] <christophler> ok
[08:03:32] <christophler> now it works
[08:03:34] <christophler> thanks
[08:03:35] <shoky> christophler: just do var self = this; instead of what you had
[08:03:39] <shoky> cool
[08:03:43] <christophler> think it was the $(this)
[08:03:45] <christophler> thanks so much gutys
[08:04:00] <christophler> that was a "problem before Ive even started" kind of gig. nowhere to go!!!
[08:04:24] <christophler> also you might, possibly, want to change the website to say that the jquery irc channel is on #jQuery, not on #jquery!!!
[08:04:32] <christophler> as it took me half an hour to guess that!
[08:04:40] <shoky> huh
[08:04:43] <christophler> thanks so much!
[08:04:53] <xec_> o.O
[08:04:55] <shoky> IRC channel names aren't case sensitive afaik
[08:05:05] <christophler> they are in irssi, apparently
[08:05:09] <xec_> i'm on #jquery now according to my irc client
[08:05:12] <christophler> me too
[08:05:13] <shoky> me too
[08:05:32] <shoky> .. . . . .. .,,,
[08:05:36] <christophler> but if I join "#jquery" there is no one there.. the I closed the window, and join #jQuerty, and here you all are!
[08:05:46] <christophler> minus the t
[08:05:46] <shoky> haha.
[08:05:49] <shoky> ha.
[08:06:01] <xec_> christophler: maybe you were on the wrong server?
[08:06:05] <christophler> I might do it again, to check if Im going mad.
[08:06:10] <christophler> nope, only connected to holmes.freenoed
[08:06:14] <christophler> brb
[08:06:18] <shoky> maybe you tried #jquerty ..
[08:06:25] <christophler> hmm
[08:06:27] <xec_> or freenoed xD
[08:06:31] <shoky> lol
[08:06:35] <christophler> yep, I was on the wrong server
[08:06:41] <christophler> localhost, not freenode
[08:06:43] <christophler> meh
[08:06:44] <christophler> anyway
[08:06:46] <christophler> thanks so much
[08:06:55] <christophler> no I have more errors to deal with, hopefully Il work them out!
[08:07:01] * christophler is closing access to that page xx
[08:07:04] <PlasmaBunny> localhost is good server too
[08:07:19] <christophler> jeje
[08:07:20] <shoky> much porn
[08:08:11] <rickdrink> hey, guys, I seek for your wisdom: what do you suggest to distribute online a custom jquery plugin?
[08:08:13] <christophler> jeje
[08:08:42] <shoky> rickdrink: a blog
[08:08:53] <christophler> hey, is there a step by step debugger way of loading a widget?
[08:09:11] <xec_> rickdrink: github is nice, especially for collaboration
[08:09:12] <shoky> christophler: there's step by step debugger of javascript
[08:09:17] <rickdrink> @shoky: a personal blog or a plugin dedicated blog?
[08:09:18] <christophler> firebug?
[08:09:38] <shoky> rickdrink: i was just shouting out.. but i meant a personal blog
[08:09:49] <christophler> is there a command to make firebug drop into set by set mode or something?
[08:09:49] <shoky> well, a technical one, maybe
[08:10:06] <rickdrink> yeah, I thought you meant that
[08:10:09] <rickdrink> :)
[08:10:09] <PlasmaBunny> rickdrink: rabbit dedicated blog
[08:10:20] <christophler> ahah
[08:10:23] <PlasmaBunny> all programmers love rabbits
[08:10:29] <PlasmaBunny> they will respect you and your plugin
[08:10:31] <shoky> christophler: you can set breakpoints in the scripts tab. and you can also put 'debugger;' in your code
[08:10:35] <christophler> yep!
[08:10:35] <xec_> christophler: you can put a debugger; statement in your code where you want it to break, or just set a breakpoint
[08:10:36] <christophler> ok
[08:10:40] <christophler> great
[08:10:40] <shoky> ;p
[08:10:40] <christophler>  thanks
[08:10:41] <christophler> !!
[08:10:41] <christophler> xx
[08:10:43] <xec_> dammit shoky beat me to it
[08:10:47] <xec_> xec--
[08:10:58] * shoky sits on xec_
[08:11:06] <christophler> wow, it comes up RED on gedit
[08:11:17] * xec_ feels squished for some reason
[08:11:20] <rickdrink> @plasmabunny: nice idea, a blog full of bunnies and... oh, well, there's also a jquery plugin, but don't pay much attention to that _:P
[08:11:32] <shoky> that's the exact same thing you said when i sat on you last, a few months ago
[08:11:49] <shoky> so, yeah.
[08:12:01] <shoky> im a squisher
[08:12:10] <xec_> shoky: nah, last time i said "are you a hot chick?"
[08:12:10] <shoky> deal with it
[08:12:13] <xec_> wishful thinking
[08:12:33] <shoky> that was me? OhhHHhh
[08:14:12] <christophler> does it make sense to the use the un squashed verison of jquery when you have no idea what you are doing, to get a better idea of where errors are coming from?
[08:14:17] <PlasmaBunny> rickdrink: also, you can make a logo of your plugin with bunny
[08:14:20] <PlasmaBunny> and called it jbunny
[08:14:23] <shoky> christophler: 100% sense
[08:14:27] <johnkpaul> christophler: yes!
[08:14:31] <PlasmaBunny> also, it should do something bunny, like hopping on your screen
[08:14:38] <johnkpaul> christophler: in development, you shoudl always do that
[08:14:42] <christophler> ok
[08:14:44] <christophler> thanks!
[08:14:48] <rickdrink> @pbunny: bunnies in a logo are always successful, look at Playboy
[08:14:50] * christophler is obviously on fire today
[08:15:02] <xec_> rickdrink: careful though, some rabbits are killers
[08:15:16] <PlasmaBunny> i bet many companies will want to use jbunny on their websites
[08:15:21] <PlasmaBunny> because bunnies improve mood of customers
[08:15:28] <rickdrink> maybe I should put a disclaimer about ravenous rabbits
[08:15:31] <PlasmaBunny> and latter are more likely to make purchases/etc
[08:17:37] <shoky> the great jbunny massacre of 2012
[08:18:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Anyone with good Jquery and php experience up for a quick job?
[08:18:44] <ecky--ptang-zoob> paid job...
[08:20:44] <sunbeam> any idea how i can give another color to the list-style-type digit of the OL ?
[08:21:34] <darkfrog> how do I remove a child by index from the dom?
[08:21:49] <ecky--ptang-zoob> remove()
[08:22:21] <darkfrog> ecky--ptang-zoob: okay...then let me change the question...how do I look up an element by index? :-p
[08:22:29] <mugsie> darkfrog: by index?
[08:22:31] <mugsie> or id
[08:22:43] <darkfrog> mugsie: index....this is text content, so it has no id
[08:22:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> what do you mean by "index" ?
[08:23:19] <darkfrog> ecky--ptang-zoob: I don't know how to clarify further....the index of the element in the parent beginning at 0. :-p
[08:23:30] <xec_> .children().eq(3).remove() ?
[08:23:34] <shoky> ?nth-child
[08:23:35] <bot-t> :nth-child(index/even/odd/equation): Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[08:23:57] <shoky> or what xec said
[08:24:11] <xec_> yay 1 point for me
[08:24:37] <sunbeam> any idea how i can give another color to the list-style-type digit of the OL ?
[08:24:37] <shoky> take five
[08:24:39] <darkfrog> xec_: thanks! :)
[08:25:01] * xec_ takes five from shoky
[08:25:20] <shoky> no i mean take a break, i ain't giving out any more points
[08:25:25] <pandemic> sunbeam: http://jsfiddle.net/BJurN/
[08:25:30] <shoky> haw haw
[08:25:46] <xec_> hehe, too late now, i already misunderstood you on purpose and the action is not reversible
[08:25:51] <xec_> *evil laughter*
[08:26:09] <rickdrink> xec_ surely use jbunny I guess
[08:26:38] <sunbeam> pandemic: thanks, but thats out of my hands as it are wordpress content lists
[08:26:50] <pandemic> i don't think you can do what you are asking for then
[08:27:05] <xec_> rickdrink: any self-respecting webdev is a heavy jbunny abuser
[08:27:13] <xec_> s/abuser/user
[08:27:17] <pandemic> sunbeam: you could always wrap the contents of the list with jquery
[08:27:22] <pandemic> one sec, i'll show ya
[08:27:33] <rickdrink> xec_: plasmabunny will be proud of you :3
[08:29:09] <sunbeam> pandemic: ok
[08:29:44] <darkfrog> removing by index doesn't seem to work....does that not apply to text?
[08:30:10] <xec_> darkfrog: i was assuming you were working with a jquery collection
[08:30:13] <pandemic> sunbeam: http://jsfiddle.net/BJurN/1/
[08:30:23] <xec_> darkfrog: what exactly are you working with?
[08:30:27] <darkfrog> I'm working with the parent.children()
[08:30:36] <xec_> what is "parent" in this context
[08:30:38] <darkfrog> so parent.children().eq(index).remove();
[08:30:45] <darkfrog> a Button
[08:31:17] <darkfrog> I'm trying to remove the first block of text from the button
[08:31:17] <xec_> so, a DOM element?
[08:31:23] <darkfrog> xec_: yes
[08:31:40] <xec_> ok, if thats the case try $(parent).children()...
[08:32:14] <shoky> $(parent) ?
[08:32:22] <shoky> oh
[08:32:55] <shoky> darkfrog: the button has children elements?
[08:33:02] <xec_> hehe.. indeed -.-
[08:33:06] <xec_> oh god
[08:33:10] <rickdrink> pretty wierd
[08:33:26] <xec_> i didn't even think of that. shoky take five
[08:33:31] <shoky> lol ;D
[08:33:48] <darkfrog> shoky: yes
[08:33:55] <darkfrog> shoky: tried $(parent)
[08:34:00] <xec_> darkfrog: we need to know how your var "parent" is defined
[08:34:17] <darkfrog> var parent = $('#testButton');
[08:34:30] <xec_> darkfrog: and what does your html look like?
[08:34:32] <darkfrog> testButton being the id
[08:34:35] <xec_> ?p
[08:34:38] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:34:47] <darkfrog> <button id="testButton">Test Button</button>
[08:34:58] <xec_> darkfrog: ok. and what are you trying to do?
[08:35:07] <darkfrog> remove "Test Button"
[08:35:15] <xec_> remove the text?
[08:35:25] <darkfrog> xec_: yes
[08:35:26] <xec_> try parent.text("")
[08:35:27] <rickdrink> words arn't DOM element
[08:35:45] <pandemic> sunbeam: that work for you?
[08:35:45] <rickdrink> yeah, you should work on your elem text
[08:36:11] <sunbeam> pandemic: sec
[08:36:15] <darkfrog> but how do you remove text when it's like: <div id="testDiv">One<b>Two</b>Three</div> and you want to remove "One"?
[08:36:18] <pandemic> sure thing
[08:36:47] <rickdrink> this HTML is kinda senseless only to me?
[08:37:08] <darkfrog> rickdrink: of course it is...but this is example content of a much larger need.
[08:37:11] <shoky> darkfrog: put the text blocks in a <span>
[08:37:21] <shoky> or in some element..
[08:37:23] <sunbeam> pandemic: yep great!
[08:37:24] <sunbeam> thanks
[08:37:26] <NoiseEee> darkfrog: easiest way would probably either add markup, or str.replace current content
[08:37:29] <pandemic> no problem :)
[08:37:36] <sunbeam> didn't know this wrapInner
[08:37:55] <darkfrog> this is for a web framework that is sending changes from the server to the client to manipulate the dom
[08:38:21] <rickdrink> it's better not to use plain text if you can wrap it with span or div
[08:38:50] <xec_> darkfrog: $("#testDiv")[0].firstChild.textContent = "";
[08:38:51] <darkfrog> rickdrink: agreed as a general rule, but I can't make generalizations like that in a web framework
[08:38:57] <ixti> Hi everybody.
[08:39:02] <rickdrink> I see
[08:39:07] <shoky> darkfrog: you can also use .contents() instead of .children()
[08:39:07] * xec_ snickers
[08:39:11] <sunbeam> pandemic: and giving the first, second and third ol a class? (.first-ol etc) ?
[08:39:23] <shoky> darkfrog: that will get the text nodes as well
[08:39:32] <darkfrog> xec_++
[08:39:46] <pandemic> sunbeam: Sure, or you could use CSS selectors for that
[08:39:53] <shoky> ?contents
[08:39:53] <bot-t> .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[08:40:13] <ixti> Does anybody knows what is more efficient for global events:
[08:40:18] <darkfrog> aha!
[08:40:20] <darkfrog> contents worked. :)
[08:40:28] <darkfrog> that's exactly what I needed, thanks! :)
[08:40:38] <ixti> $('body').on('mouseenter', 'a[data-whatever]', function () {})
[08:40:56] <ixti> or $('body').on('mouseenter', 'a.whatever', function () {})
[08:41:08] <sunbeam> pandemic: that work in most browsers?
[08:41:29] <sunbeam> pandemic: the only issue is that i cannot give that 1, 2, ,3 ,4,5 before each li content a background
[08:41:36] <shoky> ixti: the 2nd one will probably have a bit better performance, but i'm sure you dont have to worry about it, it's marginal
[08:41:37] <sunbeam> the background will be applied after the 1.
[08:41:43] <fusion27> with chrome developer tools or firebug, is there a way to dig in to the event handling, for example, on a click?
[08:41:48] <darkfrog> bwahaha, it's alive! :-p
[08:41:52] <fusion27> I'm looking at someone else's code
[08:42:15] <darkfrog> sorry, sometimes I feel a bit like a mad scientist
[08:42:38] <christophler> I cant decide if the scoping in javascript is brilliant or insance
[08:42:46] <christophler> actually that pretty much goes for ECMA scrpit
[08:42:47] <xec_> darkfrog: me too. and i'm not even a scientist. or mad. i think.
[08:42:49] <darkfrog> christophler: instane
[08:42:51] <ixti> shoky: thanks. do you mean that difference will be insignificant?
[08:43:07] <darkfrog> insane that is....ECMAScript is crazy both in ActionScript and JavaScript
[08:43:07] <shoky> ixti: in almost all cases, yeah
[08:43:08] <alaing> Hi I want to run a funtion if my text field that is using autocomplete loses focues and the user has not selected an option that appears as part of the autocomplete. what event should I use?  I was thinking onblur but I thought this might be called when a user is selecting an option in the autocomplete list
[08:43:13] <christophler> yepo
[08:44:08] <darkfrog> I know JavaScript far too well and finally getting around to migrating to using jQuery where possible...it helps with the migraines. :o
[08:44:18] <xec_> alaing: blur probably
[08:44:36] <ixti> shoky: thanks
[08:44:49] <xec_> alaing: you'll just need to check for the conditions and return false if you don't want to lose focus iirc
[08:45:00] <adam_lynch> very unrelated question, but has anyone used responsive design inside an iframe?
[08:45:11] <christophler> Im creating a widget that manages a group of select elements in a form, to make sure that they alway shave unique values (as regards each other). The values are "ordered". Im wondering whether to keep the state of the individual Select's inside the group, or store state in another ui.widget attached to the individual select items. Any opinions?
[08:45:22] <alaing> xec_: so not autocomplete change event
[08:45:31] <christophler> Or just point me to the one that exists already
[08:46:11] <alaing> xec_: so when a user moves through the list the text field doesn't lose focus?
[08:46:31] <sunbeam> Guys, any idea how I can add a 1. (depending on which LI) at the start of each li?
[08:46:51] <xec_> alaing: i don't think so, but try and see, it's a good point
[08:46:54] <sunbeam> using list-style-type: decimal; doesn't work for me because the digit needs to have a background
[08:47:10] <alaing> xec_: thank you
[08:48:46] <xec_> alaing: actually, returning false won't do the trick - you'll have to re-apply the focus. that said i'm not sure it's a great idea ux-wise
[08:49:01] <rickdrink> @sunbeam: what if you dinamically inject a span with the desired text?
[08:50:35] <Gho5t> I'm having an issue with jquery ui animation callbacks being called on completion. I have a loading image that when finished fading in does an ajax request, and when the ajax request completes it fades out the loading image. It seems to be making the ajax request multiple times. Am I misunderstanding how the callbacks work?
[08:50:44] <alaing> xec_: basically my autocomplete is returning a list of users and if the user selects a use in the list the page submits and redirects
[08:50:50] <rickdrink> @sunbeam: maybe you could also prepare your span with digits and handle them with toggle()
[08:52:03] <alaing> xec_: but if they type in say half a users name and moves on to the other "filters" select lists etc then I would like to refresh a report below that shows details of users that match those options selected
[08:52:09] <shoky> ?demo @ Gho5t
[08:52:10] <bot-t> Gho5t, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:53:13] <Gho5t> ok
[08:53:41] <xec_> alaing: hmm.. i'm not convinced this will be very straight-forward to achieve, but i still think the blur event is key
[08:54:11] <xec_> acheive? achieve? acheve? anchovies?
[08:54:28] <mikepj> anchovies imo
[08:54:37] <xec_> yeh, it's always the last one
[08:54:51] <shoky> it's always 'ie' except when after the letter c
[08:55:13] <xec_> so "ahceive"
[08:55:13] <shoky> or when having the ay sound
[08:55:19] <shoky> hh
[08:55:50] <xec_> this means i got it right the first try! xec++
[08:55:56] <rickdrink> bye guys
[08:56:10] <xec_> why do i doubt myself and spam the channel? xec--
[08:56:49] <shoky> xec+=5
[08:57:21] <shoky> /999999
[08:57:21] <xec_> :D
[09:20:11] <Gho5t> I was being dumb again. there were multiple elements I was attaching the animations too when I thoguht there was just one
[09:38:39] <kamo> What is the best method for writing this litle bit of code? http://jsfiddle.net/kamodev/ycfSC/
[09:41:08] <FernandoBasso> Is it possible to use make masked-input leave the numbers showing on the input box?
[09:41:08] <xec> kamo: what you got is pretty straightforward - is it not doing what you expected?
[09:50:29] <kamo> @xec It is doing what the devleoper expected but the  must be a pattern that can be used here...
[09:51:06] <shoky> kamo: that's not enough info to know what kind of pattern you're looking for
[09:51:43] <kamo> Cool I will update the fiddle then to explain more :)
[09:51:45] <lancerforhire> Assuming I have a departure time in UTC (str), an offset (int), and a daylight savings flag (bool), how can I set [http://keith-wood.name/countdown.html], how can I use these to localize the countdown hours?
[09:52:01] <lancerforhire> departure date and time*
[09:52:15] <lancerforhire> oops
[09:52:33] <lancerforhire> My question was if I have all of those three variables, what is the process to localize the countdown?
[09:52:58] <lancerforhire> The documentation isn't of much help :/
[09:53:09] <lancerforhire> I know there are people with big brains in here
[09:55:26] <lancerforhire> Ah wait, the time that I have isn't in UTC
[09:55:30] <lancerforhire> that's what the offset is for
[10:08:33] <Drager_> How can I make a post onload?
[10:08:39] <Drager_> Onload then post to a form
[10:11:13] <elegos> hello! I've tried creating a "rolling" effect in CSS3, but it resulted being possible only with -webkit-mask-box-image (which is not CSS3 standard), something like this: http://pasteboard.co/1346072739100026.png (i.e. the div is transparent-opaque-transparent). Is there any way to make the same effect, maybe a real 3D effect rotating the angle line-per-line, with a jQuery plugin? Actually the div has overflow: hidden (it's way longer than
[10:11:13] <elegos> that). Thanks...
[10:12:43] <elegos> P.S. the idea is to make the div "roll" in % relative to the pointer's Y coord relative to the div itself
[10:16:15] <hLVE> Sooo. IE is going to be the death of me.
[10:16:19] <hLVE> IE8 specifically.
[10:18:25] <elegos> hLVE: don't lose the hope! I'm currently on Windows 8 (Dreamspark/MSDN) and IE10 seems to be the prodigal Son back to W3C :)
[10:18:46] <hLVE> IE10 is gorgeous. I just wish they would nuke the hell out of IE8.
[10:18:47] <hLVE> lol
[10:19:06] <hLVE> So basically, I have this:
[10:19:10] <hLVE> $.ajax({ url: "/tsweb/maintenance" }).done(function (html) { $("#ajaxtickr").append(html); });
[10:19:33] <hLVE> IE8 is getting LOG: Element does not exist in DOM!   alert on every reload
[10:19:33] <elegos> I just tested my website with IE10 just thinking "ahhhh, now I have to fix it for IE!!!", and I was surprised EVERYTHING was OK xD
[10:20:22] <elegos> can't you just $("#ajaxtickr").load("/tsweb/maintenance");?
[10:20:46] <hLVE> One sec. I forget why we weren't using load.
[10:20:53] <hLVE> let me check
[10:34:49] <Jon471> is it faster to append/prepend an html fragment by passing a jquery object, a DOM node, or just a string?  or is it all basically the same
[10:36:06] <ryanneufeld> Jon471: http://jsperf.com/creating-dom-elements2/2
[10:42:28] <Jon471> ryanneufeld: ah cool, thanky
[10:47:31] <grifx_> Hello
[10:49:02] <grifx_> I have a field : Company ... Poeple will write "Société Louis Vuitton", I want to write societe-luis-vuitton in another field
[10:49:05] <grifx_> How can I do that
[10:49:22] <ak> hm
[10:49:24] <grifx_> What could be the name of the function I don't know what to search on google i'm french
[10:49:37] <ak> there's no such function :)
[10:49:52] <ak> but we can make one
[10:50:09] <pandemic> grifx_: maybe try writing a regex to replace the characters you don't want with ones you do
[10:50:22] <grifx_> that could be calling sanitizing ?
[10:51:10] <pandemic> http://semplicewebsites.com/removing-accents-javascript
[10:51:16] <pandemic> something along those lines?
[10:52:29] <grifx_> pandemic: yes
[10:52:44] <pandemic> cool :)
[10:52:50] <grifx_> latinise, then replace ' ' by '-'
[10:52:59] <pandemic> yep :)
[10:53:02] <grifx_> then replace uppercase by lowercase
[10:54:55] <grifx_> value.latinise().toLowerCase().replace(".", ":");
[10:55:04] <grifx_> Do you think that will work ?
[10:55:08] <grifx_> humm
[10:55:15] <grifx_> value.latinise().toLowerCase().replace(" ", "-");
[10:55:25] <ak> there's only one way to know grifx_  :)
[10:55:33] <grifx_> :)
[10:56:12] <grifx_> argh
[10:56:14] <grifx_> String.prototype.latinise = function() { return this.replace(/[^A-Za-z0-9]/g, function(x) { return latin_map[x] || x; }) };
[10:56:36] <grifx_> what is prototype
[10:56:37] <pandemic> you need to define your own map
[10:56:41] <grifx_> it's the framework ?
[10:56:44] <grifx_> because i don't know it
[10:56:50] <ak> no prototype is the prototype
[10:56:54] <grifx_> ah ok
[10:56:57] <ak> ;)
[10:56:59] <grifx_> fewwww
[10:57:01] <pandemic> you are extending the String object so that you can say something like "blah".latinize()
[10:58:40] <Croves> Hello guys!
[10:59:11] <Croves> I'm using $.post, but I can't get the response text
[10:59:56] <hLVE> ugrh.
[11:00:01] <ColKurtz> grifx_, prototype is one of javascript's OOP features for extending an object's methods
[11:00:12] <ColKurtz> It's also the name of a js library
[11:00:20] <grifx_> ah ok
[11:00:21] <hLVE> Ajax & Load both keep getting the Element does not exist in DOM! in IE8
[11:00:22] <hLVE> >:[
[11:00:47] <grifx_> ColKurtz: I wasn't sure
[11:01:21] <wilornel> hey guys, I dont understand, in this jsfiddle: http://fiddle.jshell.net/zsJAr/205/  When is the function called?
[11:01:50] <ColKurtz> grifx_, jquery's "fn" method is also an alias for prototype
[11:01:51] <ColKurtz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4083351/what-does-jquery-fn-mean
[11:02:23] <ryanneufeld> wilornel: which function?
[11:02:29] <wilornel> There is $(function(){
[11:02:30] <ryanneufeld> wilornel: there are several ones
[11:02:37] <ryanneufeld> ?ready @wilornel
[11:02:38] <bot-t> wilornel, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[11:03:06] <wilornel> just like $(document)ready(functionn(){ ?
[11:03:57] <grifx_> ColKurtz: Oh cool
[11:04:02] <wilornel> okay thanks
[11:04:03] <hLVE> Anyone?
[11:04:19] <grifx_> But that's not so good to use it no ? ColKurtz
[11:04:45] <wilornel> oh and what exactly is happenning with the "a" in "$(window).scroll(a)" ?
[11:04:49] <wilornel> http://fiddle.jshell.net/zsJAr/205/
[11:05:24] <ColKurtz> grifx_, it's perfectly good to use. It's just a little more of an advanced concept
[11:06:18] <hLVE> So basically, I have this: $.ajax({ url: "/tsweb/maintenance" }).done(function (html) { $("#ajaxtickr").append(html); });
[11:06:18] <hLVE> IE8 is getting LOG: Element does not exist in DOM!   alert on every reload
[11:06:31] <hLVE> I've tried changing it to .load, and it does the same thing.
[11:07:25] <wilornel> your code seems okay
[11:07:48] <wilornel> you're sure you did not mispell the ajatickr?
[11:07:52] <wilornel> ajaxtickr*
[11:08:32] <hLVE> yeah, it's working just fine in IE9, Firefox, and chrome
[11:08:33] <ryanneufeld> wilornel: yes, it's the same as $(document).ready(function(){}):
[11:08:43] <ryanneufeld> wilornel see ?scroll()
[11:08:44] <bot-t> .scroll(handler): Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[11:09:37] <wilornel> ryan: did you even look at the code?
[11:10:26] <grifx_> hmmm
[11:10:56] <grifx_> http://pastebin.com/6qaxvS0e
[11:11:01] <grifx_> that's is not working
[11:11:09] <ak> grifx_: use jsfiddle
[11:12:57] <wilornel> is it possible to just call function asd()(  by writing $(window).scroll(asd); ??
[11:13:14] <Eviltwin> Yes
[11:13:55] <wilornel> so functions are just like variables?
[11:15:39] <grifx_> http://jsfiddle.net/rYxXG/
[11:16:08] <wilornel> grifx_: what is the problem?
[11:16:57] <grifx_> wilornel: on the keyup of the company field
[11:17:05] <ryanneufeld> wilornel: yes, did you?
[11:17:26] <wilornel> ryan: I just didnt know that functions do not need a () to be called
[11:17:30] <grifx_> the username should display the sanitized version of company
[11:17:39] <ravenzz> wilornel functions can be referenced by variables
[11:17:50] <ryanneufeld> wilornel: you're not calling it that way, you're passing a reference to it
[11:18:03] <ryanneufeld> wilornel: in javascript functions are first class objects.
[11:18:15] <ryanneufeld> it can take a bit to get ones head around it if you're not used to it
[11:18:49] <wilornel> the var "a = function()" can be called by "scroll(a)", this I understand, what about if its "function a(){"
[11:18:51] <ravenzz> it can take the time you need to read what we said.
[11:19:00] <nail__> grifx_: http://jsfiddle.net/rYxXG/1/ (you were missing a .val() and .value() doesn't exist)
[11:19:13] <nail__> assuming latin_map is defined that will work
[11:19:43] <wilornel> grifx_: $('.company_field').val().latinise().toLowerCase().replace(" ", "-");
[11:19:43] <wilornel>         $('.username_field').val(username);
[11:19:43] <wilornel>     });
[11:19:44] <ryanneufeld> wilornel: http://fiddle.jshell.net/zsJAr/208/ you mean like that?
[11:19:51] <ryanneufeld> wilornel: ?paste
[11:20:01] <wilornel> ryan: yeah
[11:20:05] <ryanneufeld> ?paste @ wilornel
[11:20:06] <bot-t> wilornel, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:20:07] <ravenzz> var "a = function()" doesn't make sense
[11:20:20] <wilornel> ravenzz: it is how it was shown on stackoverflow...
[11:20:26] <wilornel> sorry
[11:20:34] <ryanneufeld> wilornel: link?
[11:20:35] <ravenzz> var a = function () { }; maybe?

[11:23:31] <ryanneufeld> I don't think I've ever seen a fiddle w/ 208+ revisions

[11:24:19] <grifx_> " " have to be replace by "-"
[11:24:26] <bcardarella> When I make an ajax request and that response is a redirect jquery's ajax seems to be following that redirect and then giving the result of that redirect as the response. Instead I want the redirect itself to be the response and allow me to handle that with the error callback. So 1) am I doing something wrong that is causing this to happen 2) if not is there a way to prevent jquery from following
[11:24:26] <bcardarella> the redirect?
[11:24:28] <ravenzz> oh jesus my jquery.log is 50MB
[11:24:30] <grifx_> and é by e
[11:24:31] <Spikes> guys, before 1.8 version i could retrieve list of events bind to the element using $(element).data('events'). What's the proper way to achieve this functionality in 1.8?
[11:24:35] <bcardarella> I'm using jquery's ajax function
[11:24:58] <ryanneufeld> wilornel: pro tip - being defensive is not a good way to get help. We're mostly friendly in here, and would love to help you.
[11:25:15] <wilornel> what are you talking about?
[11:25:23] <ryanneufeld> wilornel: you know you don't have to update every time you make a change? You can just click run, and it will update
[11:25:26] <grifx_> firebug say : $ is not defined
[11:25:35] <grifx_> on my $(document).ready
[11:25:36] <Spikes> blog says $._data(element, 'events') but that thing is prone to change. Any other way that'll work on next update or what not
[11:25:37] <wilornel> ryan: I did not make that 208 revisions!
[11:25:57] <ryanneufeld> wilornel: oh, my sorry
[11:26:24] <grifx_> I've got Jquery included in my project
[11:26:34] <wilornel> ryan: really?
[11:26:46] <ryanneufeld> wilornel: I'm saying sorry for blaming you
[11:27:05] <ryanneufeld> it's not mine
[11:27:08] <wilornel> ryan: You're saying "my" sorry
[11:27:13] <ryanneufeld> grifx_: you have a demo
[11:27:22] <ryanneufeld> ?
[11:27:31] <grifx_> http://jsfiddle.net/rYxXG/1/
[11:27:33] <grifx_> it's the same script
[11:27:51] <grifx_> And the script doesn't work
[11:27:58] <grifx_> space isn't replace by -
[11:28:14] <ryanneufeld> grifx_: you said you were getting $ is not defined...
[11:28:27] <grifx_> not on jsfiddle
[11:28:40] <ryanneufeld> yeah, also on fiddle, where is latin_map defined?
[11:28:53] <grifx_> i don't know what is it
[11:29:09] <grifx_> ahh ok
[11:29:13] <grifx_> it's the table with ...
[11:29:17] <grifx_> it's okay
[11:29:47] <ryanneufeld> so what is the problem you're having? this fiddle doesn't seem to work
[11:30:15] <ryanneufeld> likely because you don't have the latin_map defined, so your .latinize() function is failing
[11:30:23] <grifx_> http://jsfiddle.net/rYxXG/2/
[11:30:26] <ryanneufeld> so it's not even getting to the replace
[11:30:37] <ryanneufeld> mouy bien
[11:30:41] <grifx_> :)
[11:30:56] <ryanneufeld> ah, so it's replacing teh first one
[11:30:58] <grifx_> the replace, replace just one space
[11:31:05] <grifx_> why N
[11:31:27] <ak> grifx_: http://jsfiddle.net/rYxXG/3/
[11:31:35] <ak> that's it
[11:31:55] <ak> you also need to include the latin_map ...
[11:32:04] <ak> everything else should work
[11:32:27] <grifx_> you just separate stuffs ?
[11:32:32] <ryanneufeld> grifx_: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/rYxXG/4/
[11:32:47] <ryanneufeld> maintained the one line

[11:33:38] <grifx_> ryanneufeld: Do you know a function which delete "!#{|\^\||[{#"
[11:33:49] <grifx_> &
[11:33:52] <grifx_> ..
[11:34:08] <ryanneufeld> \W means non word chars
[11:34:23] <grifx_> where can I put it that ?
[11:34:29] <ryanneufeld> you can also do /[a-z0-9]/gi
[11:34:39] <ryanneufeld> if you put that in place of the \s
[11:34:50] <ryanneufeld>  /\s/g rather
[11:34:56] <grifx_> i'm melt
[11:35:13] <ryanneufeld> then it would replace *any* non alphanumeric char with a -
[11:35:38] <ryanneufeld> though, you may want to use /[a-z0-9\.\-\_]/gi
[11:35:39] <grifx_> I want to replace space by - and other by ""
[11:35:48] <ryanneufeld> okay
[11:35:52] <grifx_> by nothing, null
[11:37:59] <ryanneufeld> grifx_: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/rYxXG/5/
[11:38:02] <ryanneufeld> there you go
[11:38:11] <ryanneufeld> also replaces -- with -
[11:38:20] <ryanneufeld> so you'll only ever have one -
[11:38:22] <grifx_> Yeaahh
[11:38:26] <ryanneufeld> hope that helps
[11:38:42] <grifx_> .replace(/-+/ig, "-")

[11:38:49] <trx> hello
[11:39:10] <grifx_> ryanneufeld: awww thanks
[11:39:13] <ravenzz> grifx_ it is a good practice to check if a function exists before to 'extend' the prototype
[11:39:18] <ravenzz> btw
[11:39:21] <ryanneufeld> ^^^^
[11:39:27] <ryanneufeld> I'll let ravenzz explain that one
[11:39:43] <ryanneufeld> I gotta get back to the day job
[11:39:59] <grifx_> ravenzz: What is the function to do that ?
[11:40:01] <ravenzz> with my horrible english
[11:40:30] <ravenzz> grifx_ if (String.prototype.latinise !== 'function') for example
[11:40:45] <ravenzz> if (typeof String.prototype.latinise !== 'function') for example
[11:40:53] <grifx_> ??
[11:41:31] <grifx_> what is her name
[11:41:36] <ravenzz> if (typeof String.prototype.latinise !== 'function')  { /* have fun, this function doen't exist on the given prototype */ }
[11:42:09] <trx> i have a site using lightbox which i have modified in order to show some additional data bellow the image. the problem is, if i present a link in that data and you click on it, nothing happens.. I assume that its an inherited behaviour, so i assigned the link a class and tried:$('.mz_linked_str').off('click'); but the link still does not work.. any suggestions?
[11:42:09] <ravenzz> it might happen that there is a function with that name already, and you want to mess things right?
[11:42:53] <grifx_> i just copy paste a function on web
[11:42:54] <ColKurtz> trx, try isolating your problem and creating a jsfiddle
[11:43:11] <grifx_> Erreur : $ is not defined Fichier Source : line : 107
[11:43:37] <grifx_> the line is : $(document).ready(function() {
[11:43:42] <trx> ColKurtz i will try to do that, meanwhile, is the syntax i used above correct?
[11:44:03] <ColKurtz> I believe so trx, but it sounds like there's something else amiss
[11:44:15] <trx> ColKurtz ok, thank you
[11:45:32] <ravenzz> grifx_ also that function is redundant
[11:45:42] <grifx_> i drop it
[11:45:51] <zamn> hey i have a keypress event where it fires off an append. For some reason the append only works on the first keypress. Could someone help?
[11:46:11] <grifx_> ravenzz: i've got a problem when i put that script on my website
[11:46:22] <ravenzz> ?demo @ zamba

[11:46:32] <ravenzz> grifx_ do you have a demo?
[11:46:38] <ravenzz> what is the final version of the script?
[11:46:40] <grifx_> ravenzz: it's the same script
[11:46:46] <ravenzz> I lost the link
[11:46:50] <grifx_> all is the same

[11:48:16] <grifx_> for jquery
[11:48:23] <grifx_> but that's not working
[11:49:14] <ravenzz> is that included before of your script right?
[11:49:41] <grifx_> after
[11:49:44] <grifx_> it's a problem ?
[11:49:54] <ravenzz> it is, jquery has to be included before

[11:59:10] <grifx_> from here please
[11:59:23] <grifx_> i don't know how to do without notepad++
[11:59:38] <grifx_> just with a replace all
[12:03:11] <hobs_> do you mean line breaks
[12:03:57] <hobs_> why not use notepad++ then
[12:04:02] <hobs_> or anything that supports rege
[12:04:03] <hobs_> x
[12:06:53] <zamn> when i try to loop append to my textarea its not displaying inside of the textarea for some reason
[12:25:25] <sfreak> var items = ${jsonnames}; calling jsonnames object in jsp giving error missing semicolon
[12:29:26] <ajpiano> that isn't valid javascript
[12:29:42] <ajpiano> you call a function (like jQuery or $) with parens, not {}
[12:31:23] <sfreak> ajpiano: http://pastebin.com/8D4es0NN i am trying this script in jsp. my java controller sending jsonnames to jsp file how can i use it ?
[12:31:49] <ajpiano> start with valid syntax, go from there
[12:33:14] <sfreak> where i am wrong?
[12:33:24] <ajpiano> var items = $(jsonnames}
[12:33:25] <ajpiano> is wrong
[12:33:31] <ajpiano> the brackets, are wrong
[12:33:37] <ajpiano> i don't know what type of data "jsonnames" refers to
[12:33:49] <ajpiano> but var foo = ${ bar } is invalid 100% of the time
[12:34:25] <zamn> is there an easy way to append text to a textarea?
[12:34:30] <zamn> nothing seems to be working
[12:34:50] <ajpiano> zamn: $("#textareaFoo").val(function(i, v) {  return v + " more text"; });
[12:34:58] <zamn> i tried $("#textarea").val($("#textarea").val() + "blah"); but that just appends blah and then the cursor goes to next line
[12:35:02] <zamn> i want it to stay on the same line
[12:35:03] <sfreak> jsonnames = ["cms.doc","gnudoc"]
[12:35:12] <tw2113> wouldn't textarea need .html() ?
[12:35:25] <ajpiano> tw2113: you use val for it
[12:35:26] <zamn> ajpiano: why is there a function there
[12:35:41] <ajpiano> zamn: caret manipulation and appending are separate exercises
[12:35:47] <ajpiano> zamn: it's a function setter
[12:36:00] <ajpiano> it iterates each of the elements and gives you the current value, and what you return is what it sets it too
[12:36:00] <tw2113> gotcha
[12:36:15] <zamn> ajpiano: how can i make the caret at the end of the newly appended line then?
[12:36:28] <zamn> s/make/set
[12:36:48] <sfreak> ajpiano:  jsonnames = ["cms.doc","gnudoc"]
[12:37:04] <ajpiano> sfreak: is it already an array when you hit it in javascript?
[12:37:11] <sfreak> yeah
[12:37:30] <ajpiano> if so, $.each( jsonnames, function(i, name ) { });  should do the trick
[12:37:38] <sfreak> this is what my java controller send
[12:37:46] <ajpiano> zamn: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/499126/jquery-set-cursor-position-in-text-area
[12:38:49] <sfreak> ajpiano: it says jsonnames is not defined
[12:38:56] <ajpiano> well then it isn't defined dude
[12:39:04] <ajpiano> obviously your controller isn't working how you expect
[12:40:31] <sfreak> <c:forEach items="${jsonname}" > i tried this in jsp and this gives me all values.
[12:40:47] <ajpiano> we don't debug jsp here, sorry
[12:41:13] <sfreak> i wanted to do it in jquery
[12:41:36] <ajpiano> it's on you to get the data *to* jQuery to "do it" with
[12:48:57] <glassresistor> im trying to use the autocomplete from jquery-UI its on focus its replacing the input with the value not the label(seems like bad behaviour), when i override focus it still does the same thing
[12:49:01] <glassresistor> any ideas?
[12:49:05] <djshotglass> easiest way to count the tr's in a table?
[12:49:26] <NoiseEee> djshotglass: take a guess / start
[12:50:10] <ryanneufeld> glassresistor: that plugin is suppose to place the auto completed value into the input box, This is so that you can submit the form and get the complete value.
[12:50:22] <ryanneufeld> djshotglass: $('table > tr').length
[12:50:26] <Spikes> djshotglass, $('table tr').length ?
[12:54:46] <glassresistor> ryanneufeld: understood but id like to override the behaviour since im not actually submitting the form(ever)
[12:55:09] <glassresistor> ryanneufeld: and my users will be confused by AM19191919119
[12:55:27] <bcardarella> Is there a way to get $.ajax to not follow redirects?
[12:55:33] <glassresistor> ryanneufeld: seems like defining the focus option should do the trick it doesn't
[12:55:57] <ajpiano> glassresistor: what did you define the focus option to do
[12:56:08] <ajpiano> i think you have to return false to truly "disable" to the defualt focus behaviour
[13:01:10] <glassresistor> ;3Cfocus: function(event, ui) {
[13:01:10] <glassresistor>                         $("#search").val(ui.item.label);
[13:01:14] <glassresistor>                     },
[13:01:16] <glassresistor> oh thanks

[13:09:10] <Krambiorix> hmm
[13:11:19] <Krambiorix> ryanneufeld, i'm looking for debugging help actually :)
[13:11:25] <hLVE> jesus.
[13:11:35] <ryanneufeld> Krambiorix: yeah, how can I debug what I can't see?
[13:11:36] <hLVE> Krambiorix, for us to help you debug, we need a demo.
[13:11:39] <hLVE> lol
[13:11:50] <ryanneufeld> ?pe @Krambiorix
[13:11:50] <bot-t> Krambiorix, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net or http://jsbin.com otherwise I won't look at it. If I can't easily edit and save the code back, I'm not going to help you. Make it easier for me to help you by helping me
[13:12:49] <hLVE> ^^
[13:13:19] <ryanneufeld> Krambiorix: also in the process of creating the demo, often people will find their problem
[13:13:27] <Krambiorix> i mean, $.timePicker(ced + ' input.start_time') must be null... so i just want to check if it's null/undefined....

[13:16:22] <ryanneufeld> Krambiorix: it's an open channel, he can type when he likes.  If you are willing to provide a demo, I'm willing to help.
[13:16:36] <Krambiorix> yes i know , thx
[13:16:42] <hLVE> Krambiorix, because we're trying to help you, but you're not letting us.
[13:16:52] <hLVE> and that's beyond frustrating lol
[13:17:01] <ryanneufeld> not for me it isn't
[13:17:07] <ryanneufeld> I could care less
[13:17:08] <hLVE> lol
[13:17:27] <Krambiorix> it will just take too much time to provide a demo. + i'm not jquery experienced
[13:17:42] <ryanneufeld> Krambiorix: how does one gain experience?
[13:17:51] <ryanneufeld> By doing the thing they want to have experience with
[13:17:55] <ryanneufeld> making a demo, would count
[13:18:07] <Krambiorix> yes but no time for that now
[13:18:23] <ryanneufeld> you could even copy/paste to pastebin
[13:18:43] <ryanneufeld> in teh time you've argued that you have no time, it could have been done, and your problem may have been solved
[13:19:30] <Krambiorix> ryanneufeld, i have to lookup where all functions are located and copy paste them... That takes a lot of time
[13:19:40] <Krambiorix> should it be a WORKING demo?
[13:19:53] <ryanneufeld> look up the functions?
[13:20:18] <Krambiorix> nevermind
[13:20:25] <hLVE> Krambiorix, you came into ask for help, but then give us very little information to work with...
[13:20:34] <ryanneufeld> tell you what, start with just the HTML for the page you're having trouble iwth
[13:20:36] <hLVE> Stop being such a lazy antisocialite. <_<
[13:20:41] <ryanneufeld> we'll go from there
[13:20:47] <ryanneufeld> hLVE: being a bully doesn't help
[13:21:11] <ryanneufeld> hLVE: name calling doesn't solve anything. I'm sure Krambiorix is frustrated.
[13:21:14] <Krambiorix> lol @ antisocialite

[13:21:43] <bung> Krambiorix: why is input.start_time in quotes? is it a variable?
[13:22:09] <Krambiorix> bung, no
[13:22:10] <bung> Krambiorix: did you try (ced + ' ' + input.start_time)
[13:22:22] <bung> what input does .timepicker expect
[13:22:36] <bung> console.log(ced + ' input.start_time');
[13:22:41] <Krambiorix> bung, the class of the input field
[13:22:47] <bung> does that output what its supposed to be
[13:23:32] <bung> if a line like that is breaking: a) timepicker doesnt exist, b) time picker is getting the wrong input, c) your variables dont exist
[13:25:03] <bung> class of the input field... you mean $.timepicker(ced + ' ' + $('input.start_time').value()); ?
[13:25:18] <bung> sounds like youre putting the wrong thing in there
[13:25:24] <bung> do the console log and see if its right
[13:25:45] <Krambiorix> bung, yes. But i know what the problem is. The field doesn't exist. This happens in some cases and is perfectly fine. I just want to add a condition  like : var t = $.timePicker(ced + ' input.start_time'); if(typeof t !== 'undefined'){  .... do something....} else{ do that other thing}
[13:26:25] <Cheema> hi
[13:26:27] <bung> if( $('input.start_time').length ){ var t=$.timepicker(... } else { }
[13:26:36] <bung> take your pick where you want the logic to go
[13:26:42] <bung> i prefer to see if im going to pass in something bad first
[13:27:02] <bung> sounds like you already have an answer to your problem
[13:27:12] <bung> have you tried what you just mentioned?
[13:27:17] <ryanneufeld> if($(ced + ' input.start_time').length > 0) @ Krambiorix
[13:28:04] <bung> is that necessary?
[13:28:11] <bung> i better remember that
[13:28:17] <Cheema> in this: http://www.devbridge.com/projects/autocomplete/jquery/   - How would I define the link of each option?
[13:28:36] <Cheema> would I just do it normally with html, e.g. <a href = "">option</a> ?
[13:28:40] <Krambiorix> bung, it works!
[13:29:09] <Krambiorix> ryanneufeld, thanks i completed it
[13:29:15] <ryanneufeld> k
[13:29:20] <Krambiorix> big thanks bung!!!
[13:29:34] <Krambiorix> ryanneufeld, thanks for the good intentions! ;-)
[13:29:34] <Cheema> any help would really be appreciated :)
[13:29:45] <bung> most of the time people wont do that much thinking for you, but im procrastinating from my own work lol
[13:30:04] <ryanneufeld> Krambiorix: what bung says is right
[13:30:37] <bung> well its not like i thought of somethign hard, but parsing what you're trying to get help with takes thinking
[13:30:53] <bung> if that makes any sense i dont know
[13:30:56] * bung gets back to work
[13:32:03] <Krambiorix> bung yes, but i'm tired and fed up with the thing
[13:32:14] <ryanneufeld> we've all been there man

[13:33:33] <dabear_> sfreak: what the heck is a jquery variable?
[13:33:43] <dabear_> hint: there is nothing like that
[13:33:57] <sfreak> dabear_: sry i mean javascript var

[13:41:40] <emcken_> looking for a plugin which can do slide transitions (left/right) between html sections
[13:41:46] <rgr> when using something like $("[^autofade-]") to match a class name is the *rest* of the matching class name stored in anything in the context of the $(this) that results?
[13:44:15] <Spikes> huh, when was keyword "self" replaced with "that"?
[13:49:46] <rgr> ok, what I want to do : get a collection of all elements who have a class beginngin with XYZ - and then have access to only that class name if it has multiple classes. e.g suppose an element has class of "XYZ-99 foo bar" I want to select "begins with XYZ" and then have that XYZ-90 available to me in the match function. Whats the best approach?
[13:55:48] <shadykhan> how can i make it so if a content is empty the content hides itself:?
[13:56:30] <rgr> you mean an element?

[13:59:13] <darkfrog> On page load I'm setting a cookie but when the first AJAX request comes through it can't find it and has to create another...

[14:06:58] <miquery> hi coders...
[14:07:28] <miquery> I have a quick question about jquery 1.7.1 and 1.6.4
[14:09:01] <miquery> I have a page that is rendered as blank with 1.7.1 and renders perfectly fine with 1.6.4
[14:09:10] <miquery> what can be an issue?
[14:14:06] <wilornel> miquery: maybe some functions have been deleted when they updated to 1.7.1
[14:15:19] <wilornel> miquery: maybe the functions are deprecated
[14:21:50] <rgr> whats the jquery constrict for selecting one of two functions to call in a chain? e.g the equiv of $(selector).(if 1 then fadeOut else fadeIn())
[14:23:37] <codacoder> rgr: that's not a chain, it's a selection
[14:24:10] <rgr> yes. but hopefully you get my meaning.
[14:24:18] <codacoder> nope fraid not
[14:24:43] <codacoder> do you want to chain or select?
[14:25:45] <rgr> theres a shortcut in jq syntax to select the next processing part of the collection pipeline/selector/whateer you want to call it based on a value. the example seems pretty self explanatory at high level.
[14:28:14] <shadykhan> how can i write it if div height is 0 hide
[14:34:13] <rgr> its something along the lines of '$(this).delay(n[2]*1000).((n[1]=="in"?"fadeIn":"fadeOut")(1000 * n[3]));'
[14:34:37] <rgr> but thats not it, but it might explain myself a little clerer - Im not au fait with jquery terms ;)
[14:37:17] <codacoder> you talking about fadeToggle?

[15:22:52] <poliwaggy> it even works fine in js fiddle
[15:24:43] <gabriel> I have an element. If I do $(selector.)position() over my element, it will return me the ORIGINAL position of the element, even if my element is styled with css width. But if I do $(selector).width(), it will get me the css width. How can I get the original width, or how can I get the position after css styled?
[15:28:03] <poliwaggy> nvm i fixed it

[15:29:05] <gabriel> don't get it
[15:29:27] <poliwaggy> you know why?
[15:29:54] <gabriel> the idea is that the position() methods returns me the position of the entire element, even if is styled with css width
[15:30:06] <poliwaggy> you know why?
[15:30:10] <gabriel> why?
[15:30:12] <poliwaggy> BECAUSE IM BATMAN!

[16:18:28] <gjones> I'm having issues making any jquery form skin stick to my ajax form.
[16:18:39] <gjones> Is there some kind of trick I'm missing here?
[16:19:20] <gjones> The custom skin is applied after loading the page, but once the form is submitted, the skin is removed.
[16:19:41] <someprimetime> it's probably removing the class then
[16:19:58] <gjones> But I'm using the form ID as the selector and it doesn't change
[16:20:03] <someprimetime> what?
[16:20:05] <someprimetime> post an example
[16:20:09] <someprimetime> jsfiddle @ gjones
[16:20:22] <someprimetime> www.jsfiddle.net
[16:21:49] <tw2113> jsbin is better *runs*
[16:29:40] <someprimetime> if remy adds an option to customize it into 4 panes (2 top/2 bottom) i'd be into it
[16:29:44] <someprimetime> but i just prefer that layout for some reason
[16:38:01] <sfreak> how to create custom right click menu?
[16:38:43] <someprimetime> sfreak: with your brain, css and javascript obviously

[17:07:57] <goshawk> oops sorry, double paste
[17:22:14] <LindsayMac> anyone have an idea as to how to make a little loading animation while a whole page loads?
[17:23:33] <LindsayMac> I know to use the window).load for when it is done.. but not sure what to do to start.
[17:24:36] <coldhead> body.loading > * {display: none;} body.loading > .animation {display:block;};
[17:24:39] <juiceman5000> How do I get an element by Id stored in a variable?
[17:24:40] <coldhead> $(document).load(function () {$('body').removeClass('.loading');}
[17:24:56] <coldhead> $('#' + some_var)
[17:25:18] <LindsayMac> coldhead: why body.loading instead of window.load
[17:25:30] <ColKurtz> var el = document.getElementById('id');
[17:25:32] <coldhead> the first line is css, LindsayMac
[17:25:39] <coldhead> you can't do css on window
[17:25:48] <LindsayMac> Ah i didnt know that
[17:26:05] <LindsayMac> coldhead:  i was thinking this ~> http://jsfiddle.net/8WQk2/
[17:26:32] <coldhead> that works too, LindsayMac
[17:26:41] <LindsayMac> So that does work?
[17:26:53] <coldhead> ?tias
[17:26:54] <bot-t> Try It And See
[17:27:03] <juiceman5000> for some reason, $('#' + some_var) doesn't work. Is there a common reason for that?
[17:27:08] <LindsayMac> and I could do that on body element i suppose
[17:29:35] <LindsayMac> hmm didnt work
[17:31:17] <juiceman5000> omg nm, ignore  me, i'm tarded today
[17:31:18] <LindsayMac> well i mean, its showing the loading div and hiding it when its done, but its not hiding the whole page
[17:31:23] <juiceman5000> ty anywho
[17:31:28] <LindsayMac> juiceman5000:  it seems theres a case of that going around
[17:31:43] <ColKurtz> LindsayMac, instead of selecting everything with body.loading > *
[17:31:47] <ColKurtz> could you just hide the main wrapper?
[17:31:58] <ColKurtz> seems easier/less performance intensive
[17:32:06] <LindsayMac> ColKurtz:  the body really kinda is the main wrapper
[17:32:17] <LindsayMac> ColKurtz:  I amusing this code v
[17:32:18] <LindsayMac> http://jsfiddle.net/8WQk2/
[17:32:27] <ColKurtz> well the body would also encompass your loading div
[17:32:34] <ColKurtz> so that wouldn't work
[17:32:36] <LindsayMac> true
[17:33:12] <LindsayMac> well even changing it to #page , which is the next level wrapper, didnt hide it
[17:33:58] <LindsayMac> OMG i am a dunce
[17:34:20] <LindsayMac> dont mine my ass
[17:35:03] <coldhead> great work everyone, take 5
[17:35:16] <LindsayMac> hahaha
[17:35:42] <LindsayMac> now i gotta make some artwork to display while it's loading.. weeeee fun
[17:36:21] <LindsayMac> strangly, it does seem like it is loading a couple more things after.. I suppose if i put it in the footer that would make a difference? right?
[17:36:41] <LindsayMac> or no.. thats backwards
[17:36:46] <LindsayMac> i dunno come
[17:36:50] <LindsayMac> brain = fried
[17:37:05] <LindsayMac> wow.
[17:37:11] <LindsayMac> sorry guys
[17:39:55] <LindsayMac> it does seem like things are still loading after.. would using body.load make a difference with that ?
[17:40:45] <coldhead> are you loading stuff with ajax?
[17:42:13] <LindsayMac> No.. its just a page thats image heavy and I really do not want people to click around until everything is loaded, so I am going to use a loading screen until its all done
[17:43:54] <LindsayMac> Ahh it was a couple broken image paths causing the pause on loading
[17:46:24] <LindsayMac> ive got some good ideas of what to put in the preloader
[17:53:13] <LindsayMac> would you guys say a canvas loader is more effecient or a little gif ?
[17:54:10] <coldhead> a little gif works in IE
[17:54:15] <coldhead> that's an important difference
[17:54:37] <LindsayMac> yea.. true
[17:55:21] <LindsayMac> I had also thought about css3 animations, but gifs are probably teh safest
[17:56:37] <LocalPCGuy> consider also that IE is the slowest JS engines
[17:59:08] <LindsayMac> yea.. Im just going to make a pretty gif loader
[17:59:47] <coldhead> then later you will remove all this loading screen stuff because users hate it
[17:59:50] <coldhead> it's the circle of life
[18:01:04] <LindsayMac> Honestly i've never used or had the need to use it before, but like i said, its an image heavy site..  I may figure out best ways to optimize it in the future, but for now, this is what I got.
[18:02:22] <sfreak> http://pastebin.com/phEy1vvK i tried this code for context menu but it gives me error "TypeError: $("#office").contextPopup is not a function". can someone tell me where i am wrong?
[18:03:01] <coldhead> i understand LindsayMac, just rememer this conversation in 6 months
[18:03:25] <LindsayMac> In 6 months I plan to have to a better understanding of js and have it re-optimzed
[18:03:58] <Koganei> sfreak: maybe you need something like http://joewalnes.com/2011/07/22/a-simple-good-looking-context-menu-for-jquery/ ?
[18:04:39] <sfreak> Koganei: yeah i am following same tutorial
[18:04:45] <Koganei> ah dunno, just googled it
[18:05:22] * Koganei shrugs
[18:05:23] <Koganei> http://joewalnes.com/2011/07/22/a-simple-good-looking-context-menu-for-jquery/
[18:05:24] <Koganei> oops
[18:05:25] <Koganei> sorry
[18:05:27] <Koganei> did you add the js?
[18:05:37] <bil> when using .on() and passing in a event map, how do you also specify the selector?
[18:05:52] <sfreak> yup
[18:06:30] <bil> or do you just have to use multiple on methods?
[18:06:44] <sfreak> Koganei: http://pastebin.com/A35Rs4xJ this is my complete jsp file
[18:08:11] <LindsayMac> does fadein work with visible: or just display:none ?
[18:10:21] <ColKurtz> display none LindsayMac
[18:10:33] <ColKurtz> if you wish to animate from visibility you should just animate opacity
[18:10:35] <LindsayMac> thats what I thought...
[18:10:38] <bil> LindsayMac if it doesn't you can just use jquery to toggle visibility and animate via css3
[18:10:49] <bil> or toggle classes and those classes effectively animate
[18:10:50] <Koganei> sfreak: there's a document ready inside your document ready? dunno if that actually changes something
[18:10:52] <Koganei> but it's useless
[18:11:17] <LindsayMac> yea. that requires css animations.. cant do on window load
[18:11:18] <LindsayMac> right?
[18:11:59] <bil> you can have a class with animations ties to it, and use jquery to add that class to whatever lelement you want to animate on load
[18:12:04] <bil> tied*
[18:12:05] <sfreak> Koganei: ? i didnt got
[18:12:14] <Koganei> ah
[18:12:21] <Koganei> $(document).ready(function() {
[18:12:26] <Koganei> is the same as $(function() {, right?
[18:12:47] <Koganei> so you have the latter in the former. delete the $(function() { from right before your contextpopup
[18:12:52] <LindsayMac> bil:  this is for a site pre-loader, which means that css wont be loaded right away..
[18:13:12] <Koganei> did you also check if it actually loads the <c:url value="/css/jquery.contextmenu.js" /> script?
[18:13:37] <Koganei> maybe <c:url value="/js/jquery.contextmenu.js" /> ?
[18:14:03] <bil> yea not sure about your specific use case, just throwing out ideas :)
[18:14:29] <LindsayMac> bil:  yep.. thats why im telling you
[18:14:55] <LindsayMac> bil: I will be using this to display on screen while the whole page loads. The page is image heavy and for those with slower internet connections, I do not want them clicking around until its done
[18:15:35] <Koganei> LindsayMac: you could put the style in the header for the pre-loading part, that way you're sure the css is read before the code
[18:16:10] <LindsayMac> yea it seems i am going to HAVE to do that because display:none is messing with the other scripts on my page..
[18:16:23] <Koganei> display: none is not useful for visibility
[18:16:24] <LindsayMac> ive got scripts that are adding attributes to elements when the page loads
[18:16:27] <Koganei> because it resizes
[18:16:40] <Koganei> so doing opacity on something that resizes looks weird
[18:16:54] <LindsayMac> well in this case we are talking about whole page.. and some times we want the space to disappear as well
[18:17:10] <Koganei> yeah then use display none after removing visibility
[18:17:13] <sfreak> Koganei: so i should remove $(function() {
[18:17:17] <Koganei> or change opacity and height or width
[18:17:24] <Koganei> sfreak: and the closing });
[18:17:28] <sfreak> k
[18:17:58] <Koganei> sfreak: and is your script in the css folder?
[18:18:00] <Koganei> or the js folder?
[18:18:06] <Koganei> because that's probably why it's not working
[18:18:22] <sfreak> yup i kept in css folder
[18:18:28] <Koganei> weird :p
[18:18:59] <sfreak> yeah
[18:19:06] <sfreak> still it says TypeError: $("#mythingy").contextPopup is not a function
[18:19:30] <Koganei> open your console
[18:19:41] <Koganei> and write $.contentPopup see what comes up
[18:20:07] <LindsayMac> paying with ideas now
[18:20:11] <LindsayMac> yay got it
[18:20:19] <Koganei> ^_^
[18:20:27] <LindsayMac>     $('#page').css('visibility','visible').hide().fadeIn();
[18:20:42] <LindsayMac> then added "visibility:hidden" to the container
[18:20:54] <Koganei> sweet
[18:23:00] <sfreak> Koganei: undefined
[18:23:38] <Koganei> then your jquery.contextmenu.js probably isn't loading
[18:23:41] <LindsayMac> now i guess the question is of design.. to i make the background a solid color while it's loading, or not...
[18:23:43] <Koganei> focus on that
[18:24:04] <Koganei> LindsayMac: make a css loader :D
[18:24:15] <LindsayMac> we already had this conversation ;)
[18:26:36] <Koganei> made this last night~ http://jsfiddle.net/WbzDX/
[18:27:15] <LindsayMac> Koganei:  thats nice.. feels like it needs a little but of a "tail" though.
[18:27:15] <sfreak> Koganei: but i can access through url
[18:27:44] <Koganei> LindsayMac: tail? what do you mean
[18:27:58] <sfreak> although i can see complete js file in firebug
[18:28:25] <Koganei> sfreak: oh, really? :o that's weird
[18:29:46] <sfreak> Koganei: there r some warnings in firbug "ReferenceError: reference to undefined property element[1]" on line 17
[18:29:47] <LindsayMac> Koganei:  like, make the end part fade away or something similar..
[18:29:57] <LindsayMac> time for me to go home
[18:30:11] <sfreak> "Unknown property 'box-sizing'.  Declaration dropped." on line 51
[18:30:16] <LindsayMac> Koganei:  just a little suggestion
[18:30:20] <sfreak> is this creating any problem
[18:30:36] <Koganei> Lindrian: ooh I see what you mean
[18:31:23] <Koganei> oops
[18:31:28] <Koganei> LindsayMac: ooh I see what you mean :D
[18:35:09] <Koganei> like http://jsfiddle.net/WbzDX/4/
[18:35:15] <Koganei> can't really do it gradient though
[18:35:18] <Koganei> afaik\
[18:36:26] <sfreak> Koganei: any idea why this problem? and what should i do?
[18:36:56] <Koganei> pff, dude, I have no clue :/ try doing just teh context menu on a blank page
[18:37:04] <Koganei> and then slowly incorporate it into your site?
[18:37:07] * Koganei shrugs
[18:38:07] <sfreak> i tried it works there but it give problem in this application
[18:45:32] <sfreak> Koganei: is error coz of not loading of js file or there is something wrong in code
[18:46:01] <Koganei> if $.contextPopup is undefined, it's probably because of the loading the js file
[18:48:48] <sfreak> k
[19:37:45] <bung> i want to attach some hover stuff to anchors in a large site based on an ID, so <a href="..." class="product pid_XXYY">...</a> ... I was just going to do $('a.product'), but if I got rid of the product class and just did a partial match on "pid_" would I notice a difference?
[19:37:59] <maslo> hi guys I'm just wondering if there's any ways to remove every styling on an html element using jquery? I know you can remove classes and what not but what about the styling like this  for an example <table bgcolor="#000">
[19:38:38] <bung> maslo i suspect you have to actually removeAttr(bgcolor)
[19:38:54] <bung> but maybe someone has a plugin that checks for a lot of those things for you
[19:39:15] <maslo> ah I know I could do it manually I was just wondering if there was something to like reset the element without emptying its content
[19:39:29] <bung> well do you want all attributes gone though?
[19:39:35] <bung> or just style related ones
[19:39:49] <maslo> all attrs
[19:39:53] <bung> i see
[19:39:57] <bung> thats probably easier
[19:40:21] <bung> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1870441/remove-all-attributes
[19:41:14] <maslo> well that helps me out, thanks :)
[19:41:29] <bung> the second result on google as well http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3643248/remove-all-attributes-of-a-element-based-on-a-whitelist
[19:41:39] <bung> the first one mentions a while loop is bad for IE so be wary of that
[19:42:05] <maslo> yeah I saw
[19:42:23] <maslo> thank you bung I appreciate it
[19:42:33] <bung> np didnt do anything but google
[19:42:36] <bung> gl
[19:50:15] <absentbird> Alright, I have a probably obvious question. I have a form that I want to submit to a page that will load inside of a facebox pane. How do I pass the form information?
[19:51:07] <bung> whats in the facebox pane?
[19:51:27] <absentbird> Well I am using the facebox plugin, it is basically a lightbox
[19:51:33] <bung> the form itself, or the page you're submitting to or both?
[19:51:46] <absentbird> for the page it is submitted to
[19:51:57] <absentbird> So it gets submitted using a link
[19:52:05] <bung> is this only because you want to show some result in the lightbox?
[19:52:10] <absentbird> Yes
[19:52:32] <absentbird> And I want the result recorded in a database
[19:52:35] <bung> why not submit it with ajax and then launch a lightbox after success
[19:53:02] <absentbird> That could work
[19:53:09] <bung> but anyways, i guess something you're thinking of is this
[19:53:38] <bung> $form.submit(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); launchFaceBox('somepage.php?'+$form.serialize()); });
[19:53:55] <bung> you could pass the form as querystring on the page youre loading with facebox
[19:54:00] <absentbird> Thanks! I knew it would be something obvious, I just needed a second perspective.
[19:54:02] <bung> since i assume its just creating an iframe in a div
[19:54:28] <bung> that code isnt specific and wont work, just trying to get the sentiment across
[19:54:47] <absentbird> yeah, i get it.
[19:55:11] <bung> cool
[19:55:17] <absentbird> thanks
[19:55:28] <bung> im lazy so its handy when i can faux-code lol

[20:32:56] <oojacoboo> any ideas on serializing into an array the text() from a contenteditable element?
[20:33:04] <oojacoboo> with other form elements
[20:50:51] <oojacoboo> any ideas on serializing into an array the text() from a contenteditable element with other form elements for a POST?
[20:58:29] <ngharo> $('#form').serialize()
[20:58:35] <oojacoboo> negative
[20:58:44] <ngharo> y
[20:58:48] <oojacoboo> n
[20:58:52] <oojacoboo> reread the question :)
[20:59:20] <ngharo> WAT
[20:59:30] <oojacoboo> re-read the question...
[20:59:32] <oojacoboo> any ideas on serializing into an array the text() from a contenteditable element with other form elements for a POST?
[20:59:44] <ngharo> explain it like im 12
[20:59:55] <oojacoboo> you're not, but ok
[21:00:14] <oojacoboo> <p contenteditable="true">here is some text()</p>
[21:00:18] <oojacoboo> within a <form>
[21:00:27] <ngharo> OH
[21:00:32] <oojacoboo> serialized into an array with …. name="foo[]
[21:00:44] <ngharo> and serialize doesnt pick up p tags RIGHT
[21:01:02] <oojacoboo> AFAIK that's going to be form elements
[21:01:10] <oojacoboo> of which p is not, obv
[21:01:23] <ngharo> serialize your form then just append to the string
[21:01:31] <oojacoboo> … into an array
[21:01:39] <ngharo> y u array
[21:01:43] <oojacoboo> ids
[21:01:51] <oojacoboo> id relevant
[21:02:35] <oojacoboo> anyway, it's an interesting problem, but I'm going to go another way, I don't see any way aside from manually url encoding
[21:02:44] <ngharo> aye
[21:02:49] <oojacoboo> or getting the value and copying to a hidden element
[21:02:53] <oojacoboo> onSubmit
[21:03:00] <oojacoboo> but I'm going another way anyhow
[21:03:28] <oojacoboo> could of course always make the input not look like an input
[22:53:37] <sfreak> how to pass string parameter from jquery to java controller
[22:58:16] <Cork> sfreak: "string parameters" ?
[22:58:28] <sfreak> i mean string
[22:58:45] <defaultro> quick question folks on this code   var createmr =  function(form) { var  a = object.getattributes(); }   Am I correct that the object is referring to the form?
[22:58:47] <sfreak> i wanted to pass string to java controller
[22:58:51] <Cork> sfreak: if you want to get data from the js to your server you need to use ajax
[22:59:14] <sfreak> how can i do that?
[22:59:31] <Cork> defaultro: object is either undefined, or defined outside the scope
[22:59:37] <Cork> ?.ajax @ sfreak
[22:59:37] <bot-t> sfreak, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[22:59:48] <Cork> sfreak: or see ?.post
[22:59:49] <bot-t> sfreak, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[22:59:55] <defaultro> Cork, yes, there is object define above it but I am confused
[23:00:08] <Cork> defaultro: javascript scopes inherit
[23:00:10] <defaultro> it's because on top of that code, this is what I see
[23:00:23] <defaultro> var oldatttrib = object.getattributes();
[23:00:43] <Cork> defaultro: function() { var a = 'hello'; setTimeout(function() { alert(a);  }, 100); }
[23:00:43] <defaultro> oldattrib and a are different
[23:00:57] <Cork> no thats defining oldattrib
[23:01:05] <Cork> object is defined even earlier
[23:01:12] <defaultro> k
[23:01:21] <sfreak> thanks
[23:01:38] <defaultro> hmm
[23:01:57] <defaultro> let me put the code in pastebin
[23:02:05] <Cork> ?p
[23:02:06] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:02:57] <b4bofitos> whoa. this video i'm watching just mentioned jsfiddle at the exact same moment
[23:05:12] <defaultro> jsfiddle.net/paQxU no need to run it, I just want to show what I am seeing here. I cut the other codes though. My confusion is that why is oldattributes different from a? The a values are taken from the html form. The oldattributes contains the old values before I filled out the form
[23:05:42] <Cork> ugg, include the http:// so clients link the rul
[23:05:46] <Cork> *url
[23:05:59] <defaultro> oops
[23:06:11] <Cork> defaultro: the object comes from the PForm attribute
[23:06:24] <Cork> var PForm = function(object, editor, map, cord)
[23:06:41] <defaultro> k
[23:06:55] <defaultro> i'm still trying to understand the sentence you just said :)
[23:07:02] <Cork> lol
[23:07:04] <defaultro> the object comes from the Pform
[23:07:06] <defaultro> :)
[23:07:17] <Cork> var PForm = function(object, editor, map, cord) can be rewritten as
[23:07:25] <Cork> function PForm(object, editor, map, cord)
[23:07:36] <defaultro> ok
[23:07:41] <defaultro> it's a param
[23:07:47] <Cork> and when that function is called: PForm(first_argument, ...)
[23:07:50] <Cork> is your object
[23:07:51] <defaultro> something is passing object to it right?
[23:08:08] <Cork> uh no params are passed for ex. urls
[23:08:16] <Cork> arguments are used for functions
[23:08:20] <defaultro> k
[23:08:31] <Cork> and yes the calles passed the object
[23:08:37] <Cork> *callers
[23:09:05] <sfreak> $.post("test.php", { name: ${username}} ); username is var in js. is this valid?
[23:09:11] <defaultro> why could cause getattribute to pull the values from the form?
[23:09:16] <defaultro> what could cause getattribute to pull the values from the form?
[23:09:22] <Cork> sfreak: no
[23:09:32] <defaultro> in the createMR
[23:09:42] <Cork> sfreak: $.post("test.php", { name: username });
[23:10:01] <sfreak> okh
[23:10:04] <sfreak> thanks
[23:10:12] <defaultro> because somewhere below our code, there is an ajax call and it grabs the form by calling a.name, a.zip, etc
[23:11:04] <Cork> its prob relaying on some of the weirdness of form doms
[23:11:25] <Cork> but without knowing whats in object i can only guess
[23:11:36] <Cork> to a console.log of object and see whats in there
[23:12:12] <defaultro> console.log(a) shows the values of the form I typed
[23:12:35] <defaultro> console.log(oldAttributes) shows the values taken from the database
[23:12:51] <defaultro> ah
[23:13:22] <defaultro> maybe a, gets the old values and when I start typing and sending the form, it overrides the values
[23:13:33] <defaultro> I'll have to check it tomorrow. I'll put many console.log
[23:15:36] <sfreak>  $.post("test.php", { name: username }); if i want to pass url instead of test.php localhost://8080/abc/dcf. is this valid  $.post("localhost://8080/abc/dc", { name: username }); ?
[23:17:05] <shoky> sfreak: i'd go with "http://localhost:8080/abc/dc"
[23:17:20] <shoky> unless.. 8080 is not the port num? ;p
[23:18:19] <sfreak> shoky: sry typo mistake
[23:23:00] <defaultro> is there difference between .click and .bindFirst("click", ?
[23:23:43] <shoky> click is jquery, bindFirst is not ?
[23:24:09] <entrada> defaultro: what is bindfirst?
[23:24:17] <entrada> defaultro: its not a jquery method
[23:24:22] <Admax81> bindfirst its plugin for jquery
[23:24:39] <shoky> then obviously there is a difference..
[23:24:45] <shoky> as .click does not bind _first_
[23:24:57] <shoky> otherwise what would be the use of such a plugin..
[23:26:41] <Admax81> how i can show some code in chat?
[23:26:49] <shoky> ?p @ Admax81
[23:26:49] <bot-t> Admax81, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:28:04] <Admax81> pastebin
[23:29:41] <j_wright> avoid pastebin.com
[23:31:44] <Admax81> i have a trable with submit action.. if in submit event i used to .ajax for validate captcha, form is not submited :( there are my code: http://pastebin.com/5szpHzgK
[23:32:15] <Admax81> could anyone tell me why?
[23:33:12] <defaultro> entrada, maybe my teammate wrote a function called bindfirst. Checking
[23:33:19] <shoky> Admax81: ajax is asynchronous. $.ajax returns immediately, and the "return re" will be run BEFORE the success handler of the ajax.
[23:33:51] <shoky> ?ajax101 @ Admax81
[23:33:51] <bot-t> Admax81, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[23:34:20] <shoky> defaultro: he probably used the plugin..
[23:34:47] <defaultro> k
[23:34:50] <shoky> defaultro: bindFirst comes from a plugin, it does a regular .bind and then tries to re-order the event handlers so yours is run first, or something
[23:35:07] <shoky> so its not the same as .click  .. (which is identical to .bind)
[23:36:03] <narkeeso> how do you do something like, var1.hide().var2.hide()? but only use one hide()?
[23:36:22] <shoky> narkeeso: var1.add(var2).hide()
[23:36:35] <shoky> uh wait
[23:36:44] <shoky> did you chain a var2 to that hide() : )
[23:36:57] <narkeeso> whoops, guess so
[23:37:14] <narkeeso> shoky: but your answer covers what i'm trying to do :)
[23:37:17] <narkeeso> thanks
[23:37:35] <Admax81> thanks a lot! :)
[23:37:37] <shoky> ;}
[23:39:28] <Admax81> Yes, its works! :)
[23:40:23] <shoky> ;D
