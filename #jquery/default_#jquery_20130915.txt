[01:13:30] <ggdevelop> hey, I am trying to make some items hidden when I print by visibility : hidden, but the printout have these items printed anyway
[01:16:20] <JesperA> ggdevelop yeah, hide them with css, not jquery
[01:44:19] <Snoopal> hey guys. i have a function which i call like that centerObject($('#this-object')); $('#this-object') is a div where i maniupulate margin-top to center it. it contains images. in function i use function centerObject(element) { element.css('marginTop','123px'); }
[01:44:36] <Snoopal> but all images within the div also get a marginTop ?
[01:45:11] <Snoopal> but i only want the div container to have a margin top not the images as well
[01:45:13] <Snoopal> any idea?
[01:48:02] <Snoopal> ahhh
[01:48:05] <Snoopal> it was my fault :)
[01:48:09] <Snoopal> wrong selector used
[02:30:41] <sunbeam> does anyone know a good slider plugin that has a progress bar?
[02:40:49] <Tingle> what kind of text editor do you guys use for your development environment? I keep seeing ppl use netbeans. (win)
[02:41:47] <jop008> I want a header with in the center a title at the right end I want 2 buttons and at the left end I want another button. So 3 buttons in a header using jQM
[02:54:03] <io______> Tingle: Sublime Text Editor
[02:54:16] <Tingle> what kind of plugins do you use
[02:55:00] <io______> Tingle: just sass highlighting
[02:55:26] <Tingle> what does that do
[02:55:42] <io______> highlights sass syntax
[02:56:24] <Tingle> mm what is sass
[02:56:24] <io______> ah I also usea json beautifier
[02:57:00] <io______> http://sass-lang.com/
[02:57:35] <Tingle> ah ok
[02:58:57] <Tingle> btw,w hat kind of color scheme do you use?
[02:59:11] <Tingle> ive been looking through them all, but cant decide on which one looks the most "normal"
[02:59:31] <io______> Tingle: color scheme of what?
[02:59:36] <Tingle> sublime
[02:59:41] <io______> default
[02:59:50] <Tingle> so monokai?
[03:00:23] <io______> I am a default kind of guy
[03:02:03] <Thoams> sass looks neat.
[03:03:43] <the-erm> How do you tell jquery mobile to render buttons on dynamically loaded/created content?  I'm creating elements after the page is loaded, and have a button.
[03:05:09] <io______> the-erm: http://api.jquerymobile.com/pageshow/
[03:05:36] <jop008> How can I improve this header http://jsfiddle.net/bxfhM/149/ the title must be in the middle and the buttons inside the header
[03:10:49] <jop008> Find out http://jsfiddle.net/bxfhM/150/
[03:12:06] <Thoams> well done
[03:12:48] <io______> anybody know a jquery plugin for responsive background images which take into account both width and height?
[03:13:13] <io______> I am doing my own code but wondering if anybody has done that before
[03:14:41] <io______> this is what I am doing right now http://pastebin.com/qBdd7Eep
[03:23:06] <the-erm> io______: Perhaps I should rephrase the question.  What's the proper way to $("#el").append(some_html);
[03:26:46] <the-erm> some_html has a <button></button> tag inside it that is not being rendered.
[03:29:44] <the-erm> Never mind I found it call .page()
[04:00:17] <sunbeam> does anyone know a good slider plugin that has a progress bar?
[04:16:51] <Tingle> does someone here use sublime text 2 with phpcs?
[04:17:01] <dassouki> it seems that whenever I want to search for something on jquery I always get "the 50 best deisngs that involve a monkey button" Is there a resource where it's more concise and the code/examples are all best practice jquery?
[04:17:49] <sammich> what are you looking for?
[04:18:11] <sammich> if I'm looking for something really specific, I go to smashingmagazine
[04:18:42] <doug65536> dassouki: this is a really good jquery documentation browser http://jqapi.com/
[04:19:17] <dassouki> sammich: looking for more programming level stuff as in I wnat to program my own menu as a learning experience
[04:19:20] <dassouki> doug65536: thanks
[04:20:34] <sammich> damn, that's a handy resource
[04:50:30] <jop008> I have this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/Fceq7/ looks okay now I want to cnvert it to javascript
[04:50:50] <jop008> Like this http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/4/ then the page looks ugly
[04:51:13] <JackJones> hi, http://pastebin.ca/2452061 my goal is to klick on the new created link. some see my mistake ? http://pastebin.ca/2452061
[04:51:27] <jop008> So what do I do wrong?
[04:53:03] <JackJones> http://jsfiddle.net/rohdz/aJmCg/5/ , i want to add a tricker on the new record, but in want work
[04:55:32] <Tingle> anyone here use Sublime Text 2 with phpcs?
[04:59:00] <jop008> So I want to insert my HTML string with .prepend and it seems that the page is not the same as with direct html. Must I trigger something?
[05:00:55] <JackJones> why the click event will no work in my case ? http://jsfiddle.net/rohdz/aJmCg/5/
[05:02:40] <jop008> If I do a console.log (htmlstring) and paste it in a fiddle the output is as expected
[05:03:10] <jop008> if I inject the html string as child of page it is wrong rendered
[05:03:24] <JackJones> job088: was your message for me ?
[05:09:42] <Velveeta> jackjones: works for me
[05:10:04] <Velveeta> tingle: i use sublime 2, but for js development
[05:10:27] <JackJones> Velveeta: the link is clicked and your browser go to google ?
[05:10:33] <Velveeta> jop: i'm not sure i understand what you're asking
[05:11:10] <Velveeta> no, the button is clicked and it adds a new row with colspan 3 and the word 'Mike'
[05:12:23] <JackJones> valveeta: ow, the url's seems to load the wrong code :), my try was to popup the textaream on the same way
[05:12:51] <JackJones> click on new, and the text area appear on the same click
[05:13:12] <JackJones> velveeta: you understand what i mean ?
[05:13:13] <Velveeta> i get no text area...
[05:13:24] <Velveeta> but no, i don't think i'm following you
[05:14:15] <JackJones> okay, nice :-) my try was to add a trigger.click event on the new record, but that won't work
[05:15:16] <Velveeta> i don't see anywhere in your javascript that you're adding that trigger
[05:16:56] <jop008> why is my header not rendered ? http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/7/
[05:17:16] <Velveeta> jackjones: http://jsfiddle.net/rohdz/aJmCg/5/
[05:17:33] <Velveeta> dammit, it didn't save my changes
[05:17:49] <Velveeta> there: http://jsfiddle.net/aJmCg/8/
[05:19:12] <Velveeta> jop: your header is rendered in my browser
[05:19:36] <JackJones> velveeta: that's exactly what i need! why we have to use the timeout ?
[05:19:37] <Velveeta> or rather, the dom elements are created
[05:20:41] <jop008> I use seamonkey and it is not rendered okay also problems with safari
[05:21:08] <Velveeta> jackjones: it makes sure that injection process and binding are finished before trying to trigger the event
[05:21:16] <Velveeta> jop: let me check in safari
[05:21:40] <JackJones> velveeta: okay, it make sense :-)
[05:21:46] <jop008> Chrome also not okay
[05:22:46] <Velveeta> div#header is being created in both browsers
[05:22:54] <Velveeta> are you inspecting the dom?
[05:23:19] <JackJones> velveeta: my last problem is, if the focus is out form the field, that the changes will submitted to the server, something like a auto submit on focus out
[05:23:51] <Velveeta> jackjones: what if they click the cancel button?
[05:23:56] <jop008> I am focussing on the layout
[05:24:12] <JackJones> my goal is to hide both buttons
[05:24:19] <JackJones> http://vitalets.github.io/x-editable/docs.html#editable -> show buttons
[05:24:25] <Velveeta> jop: well i have no clue what the layout is supposed to look likeâ€¦
[05:24:33] <jop008> If I use plain html I have this http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/8/
[05:25:01] <jop008> If I convert the HTML code to javascript and insert it the trouble begins
[05:25:11] <JackJones> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/aJmCg/9/
[05:25:21] <jop008> I have multiple pages and all share the same header
[05:25:32] <Velveeta> jop: gotcha, let me take a look
[05:28:07] <Velveeta> jop: this'll get you a step closer, but it looks like you may be missing 1 div or something to wrap the whole header area: http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/9/
[05:39:06] <Velveeta> jackjones: i'm still researching your issue, that x-editable plugin is a nightmare internally
[05:39:21] <jop008> I take a look
[05:39:42] <JackJones> Velveeta: yes, correct, i open this little js example: http://jsfiddle.net/xBB5x/2100/
[05:39:51] <jop008> Here is the complete html code http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/8/
[05:40:04] <jop008> the wrapping in the header looks fine in this
[05:42:04] <sebsen> hi, can anyone say me why my flyoutmenu dont work smooth? http://jsfiddle.net/QqEnd/
[05:43:58] <doug65536> check out my little jsfiddle-like clone http://shye.snhdns.com/~phon/shelledit.php
[05:44:07] <doug65536> it real-time updates
[05:44:22] <Velveeta> nice
[05:44:55] <JackJones> Velveeta: maybe it's a bug
[05:45:21] <Velveeta> jackjones: looks like it, because the docs say if you pass show buttons: false, it should auto submit changes
[05:45:29] <doug65536> needs a way better text editor though, it's just a textarea now
[05:45:48] <JackJones> yes, i open a issu on github
[05:46:21] <JackJones> Velveeta: do you, we can submit the changes be coding this may ourself ?
[05:46:42] <Velveeta> what?
[05:47:30] <JackJones> i try to add event listener "on change" by myself
[05:47:45] <JackJones> Velveeta: shomethink with http://api.jquery.com/change/
[05:48:11] <Tingle> anyone here have any experience setting up Phpcs for sublime text 2?
[05:49:24] <Velveeta> jackjones: yes, you could bind something up with change, but the problem is i don't know the dom reference to attach that listener to at load time
[05:50:00] <Velveeta> internally, that editable references this.$input
[05:50:54] <JackJones> Velveeta: i bought, some link like this should work: http://jsfiddle.net/xBB5x/2101/
[05:51:15] <JackJones> ***k auto spell check
[05:53:09] <sebsen> can anyone say me why my flyoutmenu dont work smooth? http://jsfiddle.net/QqEnd/
[05:54:41] <boytoy_> sebsen: What do you mean not smooth?
[05:55:12] <sebsen> sometimes 2 submenus shown up
[05:55:34] <Velveeta> jackjones: that popover is created and destroyed dynamically when you click on your editable link and blur away from itâ€¦
[05:56:03] <JackJones> Velveeta: okay, seems to be hard to realize :-)
[05:56:30] <Velveeta> like i said, it's written pretty crappily internally :D
[05:56:49] <sebsen> @boytoy_: just try to switch fast the mouseoverevent
[05:56:50] <geoffw8_> Hi Jquery, I'm a "qualifying noob" and have a problem. My events seem to be fired off like, 5 times.
[05:57:01] <geoffw8_> I have a Favourite button, when I click it it gets fired literally 5 times
[05:57:32] <geoffw8_> anyone have any ideas?
[05:57:35] <geoffw8_> things I can google
[05:57:57] <Velveeta> geoff: sounds like you're binding it up multiple times
[05:58:40] <geoffw8_> Velveeta: what do you mean?
[05:58:45] <Velveeta> sebsen: your fadeIn/fadeOuts all seem to work as expected to me
[05:58:49] <geoffw8_> that I'm binding the same action to the button more than once?
[05:58:53] <Velveeta> geoff: right
[05:59:05] <Velveeta> is there anywhere we can see the code?
[05:59:23] <geoffw8_> Velveeta: yes, its very simple code you see
[05:59:47] <sebsen> geoffw8_: which browser u use?
[05:59:54] <geoffw8_> sebsen: chrome
[06:00:02] <sebsen> ty
[06:00:51] <Velveeta> "its very simple code you see" -- i don't see, that's what i'm asking, can i see it? :D
[06:01:16] <geoffw8_> Velveeta: hehe, sorry. Just wanted to try something
[06:01:22] <Velveeta> gotcha
[06:01:23] <geoffw8_> Velveeta: its coffeescript, if that makes a difference
[06:01:41] <geoffw8_> Velveeta: https://gist.github.com/geoffw8/7fcb4d7d93a4bfa51151
[06:01:44] <Velveeta> well, it makes me feel a little dirtier, but i should still be able to read my way through it :)
[06:01:47] <geoffw8_> woops
[06:01:50] <geoffw8_> let me add the other stuff
[06:02:05] <geoffw8_> Velveeta: https://gist.github.com/geoffw8/7fcb4d7d93a4bfa51151
[06:02:32] <geoffw8_> i added the  e.preventDefault(); and prevent propagate just revently
[06:02:34] <geoffw8_> *recently
[06:02:43] <geoffw8_> the problem existed before that. I sort of blindly tried them
[06:03:32] <sebsen> geoffw8_: i tested it under chrome and there are the same issues, pls try the mouseover faster/often, sometimes the submenus freeze
[06:03:42] <Velveeta> try dropping a console.trace() onto line 3
[06:04:10] <geoffw8_> Velveeta: under the get_element_id?
[06:04:30] <Velveeta> first line of that function, above get_element_id
[06:04:45] <Velveeta> because that function is being triggered 5 times, i wanna know from where
[06:05:17] <geoffw8_> Velveeta: the tricky thing is, and this is the thing that adds a whole new level of complexity to this is all of this code works great if its loaded from a document.ready, however if turbolinks reloads the page... then THATS when the problems occur. It suggests to me the code is AOK, its a problem with turbolinks or the action I've bound it too
[06:05:20] <geoffw8_> but ok, adding the trace
[06:05:43] <boytoy_> sebsen: Sorry no idea mate
[06:06:04] <Velveeta> i'm not sure what turbo links is, how does it reload the page, an actual full reload or some kind of javascript refresh?
[06:06:13] <sebsen> boytoy_: ok but thanks :(
[06:06:27] <geoffw8_> Velveeta: it reloads ALL of the code in AJAX'y
[06:06:40] <geoffw8_> console.trace() favourites.js?body=1:31 / (anonymous function) favourites.js?body=1:31 / jQuery.event.dispatch jquery.js?body=1:3064 / elemData.handle.eventHandle
[06:06:52] <geoffw8_> Velveeta: ^ the trace, with /'s representing new line
[06:07:01] <geoffw8_> it was triggered twice
[06:08:55] <Velveeta> geoff: i think i see your problem (reading turbo link documentation)
[06:09:37] <geoffw8_> Velveeta: i think i just found it too!
[06:09:42] <Velveeta> this thing says it maintains page state in a client side cache as you navigate from page to page, so it's probably rebinding all of your events as you navigate around
[06:09:42] <geoffw8_> about declaring inside a function??
[06:09:48] <geoffw8_> o
[06:09:57] <geoffw8_> Velveeta: ok
[06:10:00] <geoffw8_> that sounds more like it
[06:10:37] <Velveeta> you should probably bind up an event listener for 'page:before-change' to disable your favorites link, and another on page:change to rebind it
[06:11:09] <geoffw8_> sorry - when you say "disable", what do you mean?
[06:11:31] <Velveeta> $(document).off('click', '.pik-button')
[06:11:51] <geoffw8_> ahh, ok. didn't know you could do that!
[06:12:01] <Velveeta> and maybe instead of binding during page:change like i said, you do page:load
[06:12:02] <geoffw8_> awesome, thanks Velveeta
[06:12:14] <Velveeta> hopefully it works
[06:17:49] <Velveeta> ok, time for me to finish sleeping, adios for now
[06:23:45] <DaniG2k> guys how can I add a fast show call to this code? https://gist.github.com/DaniG2k/6570731
[06:24:32] <shoky> "fast show call" ?
[06:25:10] <DaniG2k> i meant
[06:25:14] <DaniG2k> show('fast')
[06:25:19] <DaniG2k> :P
[06:25:22] <DaniG2k> something like that
[06:25:52] <shoky> don't understand the question.. what's the problem?
[06:26:11] <DaniG2k> shoky: I just want to have an animation when someone clicks the add button
[06:26:13] <DaniG2k> that shows it
[06:26:17] <DaniG2k> fading in or something
[06:27:20] <sebsen> fadeIn() ?
[06:27:37] <sebsen> what u want to show up()?
[06:28:29] <shoky> you can call .show('fast') on an element that you add to the dom
[06:28:43] <shoky> and that you've hidden
[06:28:48] <shoky> with .hide() or with css
[06:28:51] <shoky> or whatever
[06:29:30] <dassouki> what's a fair jquery dev hourly rate in North america? i'm thinking of contracting something out and not sure what the pay usually is
[06:29:37] <boytoy_> At my supercool embedding setup at http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/39/edit -- for the play button, how do I set the top and left % with jQuery on .play:after?
[06:31:10] <sebsen> can anyone say me why my flyoutmenu dont work smooth? on fast mouseovers sometimes the submenu freezes!? http://jsfiddle.net/QqEnd/
[06:42:35] <DaniG2k> guys how can I get this to fadeIn?
[06:42:43] <DaniG2k> $(@).before($(@).data('fields').replace(regexp, time))
[06:43:05] <DaniG2k> where regexp is something like /70254830945200/g and time is something like 1379252528275
[06:43:27] <DaniG2k> and where $(@).data('fields') is:
[06:43:29] <DaniG2k> <fieldset><input id="tutor_educational_experiences_attributes_70254830945200_university" name="tutor[educational_experiences_attributes][70254830945200][university]" placeholder="University" type="text" /><input id="tutor_educational_experiences_attributes_70254830945200_major" name="tutor[educational_experiences_attributes][70254830945200][major]" placeholder="Major" type="text" /><input id="tutor_educational_experienc
[06:43:36] <DaniG2k> oops
[06:43:36] <DaniG2k> fail
[06:43:39] <DaniG2k> too much text sorry -_-
[06:46:04] <beancurd> wut.
[06:51:42] <DaniG2k> how can I fadeIn this fieldset?
[06:51:53] <DaniG2k> $(@).before($(@).data('fields'))
[06:52:14] <DaniG2k> Ive tried with $(@).fadeIn($(@).before($(@).data('fields')) but it doesnt work
[06:52:22] <DaniG2k> says Uncaught TypeError: Object [object HTMLAnchorElement] has no method 'each'
[06:53:07] <doug65536> DaniG2k: my guess: $(@).fadeIn($(@).before($($(@).data('fields')))
[06:53:36] <DaniG2k> doug65536: i tried that but as I said it doesnt seem to work
[06:53:49] <doug65536> no, read what I typed more carefully
[06:54:15] <doug65536> DaniG2k: my guess: $(@).fadeIn($(@).before(    $(    $(@).data('fields')   )      )
[06:55:09] <doug65536> DaniG2k: I'm guessing 'fields' has DOM elements, not jquery wrappers
[06:57:35] <DaniG2k> doug65536: that also says Uncaught TypeError: Object [object HTMLAnchorElement] has no method 'each'
[06:58:23] <doug65536> DaniG2k: where did 'fields' come from?
[06:58:42] <doug65536> DaniG2k: are you hacking undocumented stuff out of the element?
[06:58:59] <DaniG2k> hmm Ive taken the code from a Railscasts tutorial
[06:59:43] <doug65536> try console.log( $(@).data('fields') )   before that
[07:01:43] <DaniG2k> doug65536: it returns this
[07:01:44] <DaniG2k> https://gist.github.com/DaniG2k/6570731
[07:02:03] <DaniG2k> doug65536: its returning an fieldset with input elements and a link
[07:03:32] <doug65536> DaniG2k: a string?
[07:03:46] <DaniG2k> hmm i suppose its injecting that string into the page
[07:03:54] <DaniG2k> which gets parsed into html
[07:04:02] <DaniG2k> yea youre probably right
[07:04:27] <doug65536> DaniG2k: ok, what is @
[07:04:39] <doug65536> (sorry, I don't know coffeescript)
[07:04:52] <doug65536> is it this?
[07:05:08] <DaniG2k> doug65536: [a.add_fields, context: a.add_fields, jquery: "1.10.2", constructor: function, init: function, selector: ""â€¦]
[07:05:12] <DaniG2k> (@) is this, yea
[07:05:58] <doug65536> DaniG2k: weird. it looks right
[07:06:21] <doug65536> DaniG2k: um, why is the id a regex?
[07:06:31] <doug65536> oh nevermind, it's data-id
[07:06:34] <DaniG2k> doug65536: i think its replacing with the timestamp
[07:06:37] <DaniG2k> yeah
[07:06:58] <DaniG2k> so i think i can call fadeIn on $(@)
[07:07:09] <DaniG2k> if I click on __proto__ it shows all these mehtods
[07:07:18] <DaniG2k> fadeIn is one of them
[07:07:31] <DaniG2k> hmm this is frustrating
[07:07:38] <DaniG2k> should be so easy
[07:07:43] <doug65536> maybe you shoudl console.log the result of $(@).data('fields').replace(regexp, time)
[07:08:10] <doug65536> and remove that $() I got you to add earlier
[07:09:13] <DaniG2k> doug65536:  it returns this: https://gist.github.com/DaniG2k/6570731
[07:09:33] <DaniG2k> so its returning the entire fieldset
[07:09:40] <DaniG2k> i just want to fade that in T_T
[07:14:09] <doug65536> DaniG2k: is it safe to have [ ] characters in the name?
[07:14:23] <DaniG2k> doug65536: yea the code is fine
[07:14:32] <DaniG2k> let me stackoverflow this
[07:14:45] <doug65536> DaniG2k: I mean the html name attributes
[07:14:56] <DaniG2k> yeah they should be fine. I dont see why not
[07:15:11] <doug65536> DaniG2k: because of array notation
[07:15:28] <doug65536> DaniG2k: <input name="myName[]">
[07:15:51] <doug65536> have 10 of them on the page and it sends multiple myName= in the urlencode
[07:16:16] <doug65536> DaniG2k: anyway, I give up. good luck :)
[07:16:26] <DaniG2k> doug65536: so ur saying it needs to go up the DOM tree?
[07:16:31] <DaniG2k> with closest or something
[07:17:12] <doug65536> DaniG2k: one sec...
[07:22:45] <jop008> I have this $("#title").html ("test"); in my code it is part of a header element in Chrome it is updated fine
[07:23:10] <jop008> in Safari it is updated when I console.log the value but the screen is not updated
[07:23:23] <jop008> So how to refresh a header ?
[07:23:45] <jop008> The code is here http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/26/
[07:24:04] <jop008> I couldn't reproduce it in the fiddle
[07:26:06] <doug65536> DaniG2k: this works http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/xjHck/2/
[07:27:35] <Tingle> anyone here use PHP CodeSniffer Fixer with Sublime Text 2?
[07:28:51] <sunbeam> does anyone know a good slider plugin that has a progress bar?
[07:29:45] <DaniG2k> doug65536: yea but theres no fadein
[07:29:55] <DaniG2k> doug65536: mine works as well. but theres no fadein :P
[07:30:14] <doug65536> oh you want fadein???
[07:30:17] <DaniG2k> yes
[07:30:30] <doug65536> DaniG2k: so your code works, you just want fadein?
[07:30:50] <DaniG2k> yes
[07:31:05] <doug65536> DaniG2k: omg I thought it wasn't adding rows... I'm way too tired lol
[07:31:29] <DaniG2k> doug65536: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18813417/jquery-fadein-a-string-with-before
[07:31:32] <DaniG2k> :P
[07:31:59] <doug65536> you are calling fadeIn on the string!
[07:34:12] <DaniG2k> doug65536: where should i be calling it
[07:34:14] <doug65536> DaniG2k: strings can't be faded in, because they are not even DOM elements
[07:34:48] <doug65536> DaniG2k: if I were you I would create a document fragment, insert that, and then call fadeIn on that...
[07:34:53] <doug65536> DaniG2k: one sec
[07:35:46] <doug65536> DaniG2k: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/xjHck/3/
[07:36:09] <DaniG2k> yes that's it!
[07:37:54] <sunbeam> does anyone know a good slider plugin that has a progress bar?
[07:38:09] <doug65536> DaniG2k: so what you want to do is take that string (with the fieldset html), wrap it with $( )  (to create a document fragment object), call hide on it, pass the document fragment to .before  then call fadeIn on the document fragment
[07:40:46] <DaniG2k> doug65536: perfect!
[07:40:47] <DaniG2k> works :D
[07:40:52] <DaniG2k> wow that was a lot harder than I thought
[07:41:01] <DaniG2k> so $() creates document fragments
[07:41:02] <DaniG2k> i see
[07:42:01] <doug65536> DaniG2k: yes, doing it that way eliminates the issue of "finding" the new stuff on the page. you already have a reference to it this way
[07:42:56] <_rgn> when I use keydown event with chrome, and press ctrl-g, I get the charcode for *upper case* g instead of lower case, is this normal?
[07:43:10] <DaniG2k> doug65536: awesome, thanks so much for the help I really appreciate it
[07:43:18] <doug65536> DaniG2k: np
[07:43:52] <DaniG2k> doug65536: this is what it ends up as btw https://gist.github.com/DaniG2k/6570731
[07:44:36] <doug65536> DaniG2k: cool. I should learn coffeescript just to put another language on my bragging list :P
[07:45:10] <DaniG2k> hehe i dont know either jquery or coffeescript but they use it a lot in rails so i shall conform for now
[07:55:02] <Tingle> anyone use PHP CodeSniffer Fixer with Sublime Text 2?

[09:29:24] <Tingle> does php have any kind of variable notation?
[09:29:35] <Tingle> like aArray or bBool
[09:32:49] <doug65536> Tingle: I recommend not using hungarian notation
[09:33:14] <Tingle> why not?
[09:33:29] <Tingle> often have I wondered what kind of variable type im messing with
[09:33:43] <Tingle> if it was a string int or bool
[09:33:56] <doug65536> search for "hungarian notation" in google, most people recommend not using it nowadays
[09:34:11] <Tingle> yeah, ive been reading that
[09:34:15] <doug65536> the reason it isn't useful is that it isn't necessarily correct, so why mislead yourself
[09:34:17] <Tingle> but is there a other notation for php?
[09:34:40] <Tingle> something widely used to know what kind of vars your messing with
[09:34:40] <doug65536> in php, it mostly just does the right thing anyway
[09:35:00] <doug65536> "10" + 10 = 20
[09:35:48] <Tingle> mm so naming the varaible properly would be betteR?
[09:36:06] <Tingle> like outputText vs sOutput
[09:36:22] <doug65536> yes
[09:36:34] <Tingle> mm smart variable naming then it is :O
[09:36:47] <doug65536> even microsoft recommends against it since .net was released
[09:36:53] <doug65536> and they introduced it
[09:37:05] <Tingle> even when writing c++ nowdays?
[09:37:13] <doug65536> yes
[09:37:51] <Tingle> mm 8 years ago when I started getting into programming with c++,. all my books and mentors made me do the hungarian notation
[09:38:14] <Tingle> guess they are "oldschool"?
[09:38:48] <doug65536> yes, it was very popular for windows devs for years, until it fell out of favor
[09:39:36] <Tingle> ok, well thanks for the info - ill honor the new ways then ^^

[10:57:47] <boytoy_> Hi, is it possible to set the CSS for a pseudo element with jQuery? Trying to properly position the play button for this YouTube embed: http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/42/edit
[10:58:44] <boytoy_> * Hi, is it possible to say measure a height and then set it on a pseudo element?
[10:59:05] <Velveeta> that's a good questionâ€¦
[10:59:11] <Velveeta> i'lldo some digging
[11:00:12] <boytoy_> why thank you
[11:00:21] <boytoy_> was just all over stackoverflow, doesnt seem to be anything there though
[11:01:32] <Velveeta> doesn't look like you can, as there's no way to actually select a pseudo elementâ€¦ they're strictly presentational and don't actually exist in the dom...
[11:02:30] <Velveeta> now, what you might be able to get away with, if it's only a small number of variable heights you're dealing with, creating a handful of nested css rules that target that pseudo element, and use js to place a parent class selector to target the right rule
[11:03:25] <Velveeta> like myelement:before { â€¦propertiesâ€¦ } .classA myelement:before { â€¦different heightâ€¦ } .classB myelement:before { â€¦different heightâ€¦ }
[11:04:09] <Velveeta> and then depending on whatever factors modify the height to one of a handful, place the appropriate class on a parent element, and let that new nesting target a different css rule for your pseudo element
[11:04:22] <Velveeta> but if it's something that's completely variable, i'm not sure how to get around that
[11:04:45] <boytoy_> hmmm
[11:04:58] * boytoy_ copy/pastes this for reference
[11:05:04] <Velveeta> :)
[11:05:16] <boytoy_> the heights and widths vary from youtube, vimeo, soundcloud etc.
[11:06:20] <Velveeta> can you maybe constrain them?
[11:06:26] <boytoy_> and actually they're gonna vary some more once i add in https://github.com/marclarr/FitVids.js so yeah this is gonna be tricky
[11:06:26] <Velveeta> normalize them somehow?
[11:06:33] <Velveeta> gotcha
[11:06:34] <boytoy_> hmm
[11:06:46] <Velveeta> if you're gonna use fitvid then i don't know that there's anything you can do
[11:06:53] <Velveeta> because that's gonna make its size completely variable
[11:07:40] <boytoy_> true true
[11:08:02] <boytoy_> Velveeta: best do it like embedly originally intended then, with a <span>? (example 3 at http://embedly.github.io/embedly-jquery/inline.html)

[12:20:13] <DaniG2k> https://gist.github.com/DaniG2k/6573615
[12:20:29] <DaniG2k> it doesnt seem to remove the fieldset though when i look at the html
[12:20:52] <DaniG2k> I've tried both $(@).closest('fieldset').remove() and $($(@).closest('fieldset')).remove()
[12:20:57] <DaniG2k> neither seem to work

[12:21:58] <shwaiil> hi
[12:22:03] <shoky> `demo @ DaniG2k
[12:22:14] <b-ot> DaniG2k: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:23:31] <shwaiil> Q: I'm working with this plugin that requires me to addClass to an element, for one of its methods to work properly. Meaning that I can't have a dynamic propertie value, such as height. I'd like to know if it's possible to create a class at runtime ? Thanks for looking
[12:25:04] <DaniG2k> shoky: here's the code
[12:25:05] <DaniG2k> http://jsfiddle.net/Bn6sp/
[12:25:11] <DaniG2k> basically i want two things
[12:25:21] <DaniG2k> to remove that html when the remove button is clicked
[12:25:31] <DaniG2k> and (ideally) a nice fadeOut
[12:25:36] <DaniG2k> but mostly, just the remove
[12:25:43] <shoky> DaniG2k: code doesn't help, make a demo that shows the problem happening,.,.
[12:26:12] <DaniG2k> that's all the code needed really
[12:26:25] <DaniG2k> i just want to remove the html when the remove link is clicked
[12:26:28] <shoky> and i asked for a demo
[12:26:35] <shoky> you said that .remove() is not working
[12:26:38] <shoky> show that.
[12:27:52] <DaniG2k> ?
[12:27:57] <DaniG2k> cant you see from the link I sent
[12:28:09] <DaniG2k> when you click the remove, it doesnt remove the textarea
[12:28:48] <shoky> you didn't even include jquery. and you put coffeescript in a JS editor. look at the console:  Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected string
[12:29:03] <shoky> you don't even have a <form>
[12:29:08] <ggdevelop1> hi, what is the diffrence between: jQuery(document).ready(function($){...} and document.ready(function(){...}
[12:29:11] <shoky> see what i mean by working demo?
[12:29:33] <grafi> shoky is a working demo
[12:29:40] <grafi> of the shoky bot .3
[12:29:42] <grafi> oÃ´
[12:29:50] <shoky> ggdevelop1: there's no such thing as document.ready(function...
[12:30:16] * shoky pets grafi
[12:30:34] <grafi> no touching!
[12:30:35] <grafi> :P
[12:31:02] <doug65536> shoky: what?
[12:31:27] <doug65536> shoky: OH! nevermind
[12:31:35] <grafi> doug65536: exactly
[12:31:43] <shoky> lolwat
[12:31:51] <ggdevelop1> shoky: I ment: $(document).ready(function)
[12:32:09] <doug65536> ggdevelop1: $ is the exact same thing as jQuery
[12:32:11] <shoky> DaniG2k: your code works fine here  http://jsfiddle.net/Bn6sp/1/
[12:32:33] <doug65536> ggdevelop1: unless you use jQuery.noConflict
[12:32:53] <doug65536> ggdevelop1: they both refer to the same object
[12:33:02] <ggdevelop1> doug65536: and what this means : function($)
[12:33:22] <doug65536> ggdevelop1: it passes jQuery to the callback
[12:33:39] <doug65536> ggdevelop1: so, no matter what, $ will work as expected in there
[12:34:02] <doug65536> I'm pretty sure it does anyway - I don't do that myself
[12:34:33] <DaniG2k> shoky: hmm i cnat figure out why mine wasn't working then
[12:34:39] <DaniG2k> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/Bn6sp/4/
[12:34:56] <shoky> DaniG2k: learn to look at your console.  Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[12:37:39] <DaniG2k> shoky: hmm it doesnt seem to work in my rails app nonetheless
[12:37:45] <DaniG2k> its not removing the fieldset
[12:38:10] <shoky> i'd suggest fixing it
[12:38:34] <doug65536> ggdevelop1: I don't use that $ parameter thing because I use an AMD module loader, so $ will always be right in my code
[12:38:35] <DaniG2k> god i can't stand javascript/coffeescript/jquery
[12:40:01] <shoky> agreed on the coffeescript bit ;p
[12:40:53] <wer0ckz> help please - http://pastie.org/8328369#24,30 - LINE 55 - my global variable window.bid_last_amount1 cannot be moved to LINE 55
[12:46:16] <Velveeta> i have no idea what that meansâ€¦ your line 55 can't be moved to line 55?
[12:48:03] <wer0ckz> <Velveeta> i have no idea what that meansâ€¦ your line 55 can't be moved to line 55? <- the variable window.bid_last_amount1 on line 39 is working on line 41
[12:48:21] <wer0ckz> but it doesnt work on line 55 its undefined
[12:48:22] <wer0ckz> help please
[12:50:11] <Velveeta> your line 39 looks like it executes after line 55
[12:50:32] <Velveeta> it's part of a completefunc, which makes me think some kind of ajax request is going on, and that's part of its complete callback
[12:50:53] <Velveeta> once that request is fired off, your code will continue executing while it waits for that to finish, and hit line 55, where that variable hasn't been initialized yet
[12:51:01] <Velveeta> and then when the request is completed, line 39 will execute
[12:51:30] <wer0ckz> how can i make that variable work?
[12:51:57] <Velveeta> you'll probably want to move lines 55 and 56 up to line 45
[12:53:08] <djangonoob> hi, what can I do against a firebug warning something like: empty string passed to getElementById() ?
[12:53:31] <Velveeta> i would suggest not passing an empty string to getElementById...
[12:53:46] <wer0ckz> its working
[12:53:48] <wer0ckz> thank you so much
[12:54:05] <Velveeta> good to hear
[12:54:15] <Velveeta> welcome to the world of asynchronous development :)
[12:54:47] <djangonoob> Velveeta: its not my own code
[12:55:02] <Velveeta> so you're not able to modify any of it?
[12:55:33] <djangonoob> Is it normal with jquery 2.0.3 ?
[12:55:42] <djangonoob> I am not using getElementById()
[12:55:59] <Velveeta> well, chances are that something in the bowels of jquery is using that based on a selector you're passing it
[12:56:13] <Velveeta> like if you're constructing a selector like this somewhere: $('#' + myId).hide()
[12:56:30] <Velveeta> something may see you're using a hash tag selector and try to run through getElementById
[12:56:48] <Velveeta> but if myId in that example is an empty string, then there you go
[12:57:11] <Velveeta> your best best is gonna be to set a breakpoint in the code for that condition, and when it triggers, check your call stack to see where that value is coming from
[12:57:30] <djangonoob> hm... ok, I will check this
[12:57:33] <djangonoob> thanks
[12:58:17] <Velveeta> do you know how to set that conditional breakpoint?

[13:10:57] <BillCriswell> Seems like the same idea.
[13:11:45] <T13|needsCoffee> BillCriswell: is there a jQuery option to replace all <ul></ul> with <ol></ol>?
[13:12:02] <Velveeta> ecurtis: you can try duck typing it: if (fcSwipe && fcSwipe.kill) {
[13:12:12] <T13|needsCoffee> $('ul').?
[13:12:16] <BillCriswell> T13|needsCoffee: Hmmm...
[13:12:47] <platzhirsch> Is there a jQuery function for fading in and fading out an element shorty?
[13:12:54] <T13|needsCoffee> I want to make a link that will switch them painlessly.
[13:13:03] <grafi> platzhirsch build one
[13:13:18] <platzhirsch> grafi: sure, so that means no ;)
[13:13:32] <grafi> when you build one there is one
[13:13:32] <grafi> oÃ´
[13:13:48] <grafi> otherwise .fadeIn().fadeOut() ?
[13:15:19] <Velveeta> you'll have to pass fadeOut as a callback to fadeIn for animation queue purposes
[13:15:46] <grafi> or fadeIn(function() { $(this).fadeOut(); });
[13:15:58] <Velveeta> yeah that would do it
[13:16:05] <platzhirsch> grafi: ah they are chainable
[13:16:06] <grafi> indeeeed
[13:16:06] <doug65536> each element has a queue for animations. they queue up by default, unless you stop and/or clear the queue
[13:16:06] <doug65536> that's a simplification, but generally, conflicting animations will queue instead of "fighting" eachother
[13:16:06] <BillCriswell> T13|needsCoffee: I was thinking just $('ul').replaceWith(function(){ return $('<ol>').append($(this).find('li')); }); ?
[13:16:32] <platzhirsch> nice nice :)
[13:16:39] <Velveeta> doug: so does that mean you can chain them like in the first code example?
[13:17:03] <T13|needsCoffee> $('ul').parent().html($('ul').parent().replace(/<(\/)?ul>/, "<"+$1+"ol>"));  ??

[13:31:13] <platzhirsch> any idea how to approach this practicable

[13:31:43] <grafi> changing ram is very very very very satisfiying
[13:32:29] <BillCriswell> T13|needsCoffee: If you want to switch back and forth you can do like.. .css('list-style-type', function(i, val){ return val === ' decimal' ? 'auto' : 'decimal' });
[13:32:44] <BillCriswell> Think .css takes the function arguments like that.

[13:41:35] <grafi> how great is that
[13:42:03] <DaniG2k> doug65536: it still doesnt remove the html from the page
[13:42:10] <DaniG2k> maybe rails is doing something weird
[13:42:32] <doug65536> DaniG2k: why do that .prev?
[13:42:55] <doug65536> DaniG2k: it's getting deleted right?
[13:43:17] <Velveeta> i don't think rails is doing anything weird, rails just renders the markup...
[13:43:19] <doug65536> DaniG2k: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/cm96N/3/
[13:43:26] <Velveeta> if your javascript isn't working, that's a javascript problem
[13:43:40] <DaniG2k> doug65536: it seems like it gets removed but when i look at the source code its still there
[13:44:20] <doug65536> DaniG2k: what source code
[13:44:34] <doug65536> DaniG2k: view source? that won't change magically!
[13:44:36] <DaniG2k> doug65536: if on the page I do right-click, view page source
[13:44:36] <grafi> haha
[13:44:42] <DaniG2k> its all there still
[13:44:51] <DaniG2k> oh
[13:45:01] <doug65536> DaniG2k: you use chrome?
[13:45:08] <DaniG2k> yea
[13:45:08] <Velveeta> you need to use the dom inspector
[13:45:18] <Velveeta> right click and go to inspect element
[13:45:32] <doug65536> DaniG2k: press F12, go to elements tab, click the little magnifying glass, click the row, click remove link, watch it disappear
[13:47:20] <DaniG2k> oh ok
[13:47:41] <DaniG2k> but then it still seems to be available in my rails app
[13:47:42] <Velveeta> wtf, yahoo's fantasy football site is down
[13:47:57] <doug65536> DaniG2k: on the server side???
[13:47:58] <Velveeta> your rails app is server side, right?
[13:48:03] <DaniG2k> yeah
[13:48:09] <doug65536> DaniG2k: it won't magically tell the server
[13:48:15] <DaniG2k> fml
[13:48:27] <doug65536> DaniG2k: do an ajax request and remove the row upon successful ajax completion
[13:49:09] <doug65536> DaniG2k: I'll make something up:
[13:49:46] <DaniG2k> doug65536: so its adding and removing the fields but, in my rails controller, the data never passes because it sees that there are too many fields (I have a validator that checks taht there aren't mor than 5 of these fieldsets)
[13:49:52] <DaniG2k> thats why im trying to remove them
[13:50:03] <doug65536> DaniG2k: $.post('', { action: 'removeThingy', id: whatever }, null, 'json').done(function(data) { var success = data && data.success; if (success) { ... remove the row });
[13:50:04] <DaniG2k> so that there can be no more than 5
[13:50:27] <DaniG2k> doug65536: can that be done serverside? in rails somehow?
[13:50:42] <Velveeta> can what part be done server side?
[13:51:33] <DaniG2k> well, the remove function im using in jquery removes the html right? but the attributes still all seem to be there when I update the page so they're being stored
[13:51:48] <Velveeta> so how are you storing those attributes?
[13:51:51] <DaniG2k> id like to remove those attributes if their html was removed
[13:51:57] <Velveeta> that part would need to be updated at the same time you remove the row
[13:52:02] <DaniG2k> right
[13:52:12] <Velveeta> you should harvest those attributes at the time the form is submitted
[13:52:18] <doug65536> DaniG2k: tell the server, when the server responds with success, remove the html from the page
[13:52:29] <Velveeta> unless you're doing realtime storage on the server, there's no reason to keep a model like that updated in real time
[13:52:49] <DaniG2k> im just doing a really basic nested attribute form -_-
[13:52:56] <DaniG2k> and i dont want more than 5 of these fields
[13:53:03] <Velveeta> right, and when does that form get submitted?
[13:53:16] <Velveeta> as items are added/removed?
[13:53:22] <DaniG2k> theres a submit button on the edit page (update action)
[13:53:41] <Velveeta> then that button should scrape the form to gather its data to send to the server, based on the elements currently left on the page
[13:54:38] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: right. The problem is that say someone inputs text in a field, but then clicked remove. The html is still there on the page. I need to find a way to tell rails to eliminate the ones marked for removal
[13:54:50] <doug65536> DaniG2k: there are infinite ways to do it, but essentially, you have to tell the server sometime. and if you aren't requiring lots of page reloads, you need to modify the page
[13:55:23] <Velveeta> but why is the html still there on the page if you're using .remove() on it?
[13:55:44] <doug65536> Velveeta: the html is still there in view source
[13:55:46] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: thats my question too
[13:56:05] <Velveeta> but view source isn't the live view of the dom
[13:56:13] <DaniG2k> it might have to do with the fact that rails 4 uses turbolinks so it stores javascript or something for faster load times
[13:56:18] <doug65536> exactly. we went through this already right?
[13:56:23] <Velveeta> right :D
[13:56:29] <doug65536> :D
[13:56:35] <DaniG2k> so how can i get the live view of the dom in my rails controller?
[13:56:45] <Velveeta> we told you that, right click the page and go to Inspect Element
[13:56:54] <DaniG2k> yeah i know that
[13:57:01] <Velveeta> so then why did you just ask that?
[13:57:05] <doug65536> DaniG2k: for the 3rd or 4th time: tell the server with ajax or form post
[13:57:05] <DaniG2k> but rails doesnt receive that info
[13:57:13] <Velveeta> right, rails receives what you pass from the client
[13:57:24] <Velveeta> but the client should be harvesting the valid form info at the time of submission
[13:57:32] <DaniG2k> hmm i have an idea
[13:57:38] <Velveeta> so if your live dom view doesn't include those nodes, they're not there for the form to harvest for transport
[13:57:50] <Velveeta> ok, well i have to go run an errand real quick, be back in about an hour, good luck
[13:57:56] <DaniG2k> thnx
[13:58:03] <omnipotent1_> I'm using jquery waypoints and I'm having an issue with IE triggering at different times than other browsers
[13:58:10] <DaniG2k> what if i set a value, like destroy = 1
[13:58:20] <omnipotent1_> anybody else have that issue before?
[13:58:29] <doug65536> DaniG2k: don't get me wrong, but how do you know ruby and coffeescript and you have no idea how web pages work?
[13:59:46] <doug65536> DaniG2k: fundamental thing about web pages, the server sends you the page, and you essentially lose that connection. if you want to update the real data, the browser must send back a request to do so
[14:00:43] <DaniG2k> doug65536: i took the coffeescript from a railscast
[14:00:48] <DaniG2k> and im learning rails :)
[14:00:51] <doug65536> DaniG2k: think of it this way. if you printed out something, then scrubbed off the toner from the page for one row, would that data disappear from the database?
[14:00:51] <DaniG2k> for the past few months
[14:00:57] <DaniG2k> yeah i think i get it
[14:01:08] <DaniG2k> i just am trying to figure out how to deal with it in rails
[14:01:23] <doug65536> I wish I could help you there - I don't know ruby
[14:02:05] <doug65536> DaniG2k: but you must be able to do ajax. google ruby ajax
[14:02:19] <doug65536> DaniG2k: or rails ajax, or something :)
[14:02:24] <DaniG2k> ok i get what happening here
[14:02:38] <DaniG2k> i need to remove those values from the params in my controller
[14:02:48] <DaniG2k> before updating
[14:06:32] <ankurk> Is the .map() function only for arrays?
[14:08:02] <Ooppa> Anyone online? :) I'm a beginner and I need help :P
[14:08:42] <doug65536> !ask @ Ooppa
[14:08:42] <b-ot> Ooppa: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:09:42] <Ooppa> Is there a way to open load() popup with custom css and generate them easily in one page, rather on same line
[14:10:43] <Ooppa> for example <button onclick="loadpopup('http://exp.com/data.php')"> or something
[14:11:52] <doug65536> Ooppa: don't use event attributes like onload. attach event handlers from javascript code
[14:12:09] <doug65536> Ooppa: I mean onclick
[14:13:02] <Ooppa> Umm, so how would I be able to do something like that?
[14:18:15] <Ooppa> Hmmm :/
[14:18:21] <s5fs> $(selector).on('click', function(){ loadpopup('http://exp.com/data.php'); })
[14:18:56] <s5fs> Ooppa: like that, basically ^^
[14:21:58] <Ooppa> How do I put that in the code? :S I'm quite a beginner
[14:22:54] <Ooppa> In a lick for example
[14:22:58] <Ooppa> link*
[14:26:09] <doug65536> Ooppa: you make a file with javascript in it, and put a script tag in the html
[14:26:22] <doug65536> Ooppa: with the src pointing to the javascript file
[14:29:00] <Ooppa> If I click a link it opens that? where do I define what a link opens?
[14:30:06] <naprac> whats wrong with this? $("#form1").on("each","input[type=text],(function() {...});
[14:30:26] <tw2113> naprac, i don't think each is an event
[14:31:00] <naprac> iÃ¤m trying to get this to work on dynamic elements too? $("#form1 input[type=text]).each(function() {...});
[14:31:26] <naprac> whats the correct way?
[14:31:57] <Yatekii> hi, can anyone tell me why this onClick does not wor: <a onClick"moveto(-width, -height);" style="cursor:pointer;">adasdasdas</a>
[14:32:06] <Yatekii> when I call the same function in the console it works
[14:32:17] <obert> Yatekii: dont use onClick
[14:32:22] <Yatekii> why not?
[14:32:29] <obert> which it has a wrong syntax too
[14:32:38] <eddiemonge> naprac: what ar you doing with it?
[14:32:39] <obert> because you are using jquery
[14:33:14] <naprac> eddiemonge, go throught dynamically created elements
[14:33:16] <obert> Yatekii: create a function and use it, on a class or on that specific element
[14:33:43] <eddiemonge> naprac: and do what?
[14:33:56] <naprac> does it matter what it do?
[14:34:39] <tw2113> yes
[14:35:20] <naprac> i create some form fields and i want to get their val
[14:35:42] <eddiemonge> you create them and you want their initial value?
[14:36:10] <naprac> or changed value
[14:36:26] <eddiemonge> and then what are you doing with that value?
[14:36:46] <hazardous> i have some fairly intensive graph generation in canvas done that kind of slows the client a bit. what should i do to kind of lazy load it?
[14:36:53] <hazardous> i would like a function to run when the div in question is within the viewport
[14:36:58] <Yatekii> obert: https://gist.github.com/Yatekii/1fb184b1391f0d205f28 does not work as well
[14:36:59] <hazardous> don't know if there's a plugin or something for that
[14:37:25] <naprac> i stare at it, and congrats myself being able to do it :)
[14:37:35] <Yatekii> no errors
[14:37:42] <Yatekii> just not being executed on click
[14:38:04] <eddiemonge> naprac: if you dont want, then just say so
[14:38:29] <eddiemonge> Yatekii: what is width/height? a variable? where is it defined?
[14:38:38] <naprac> eddiemonge: i just don't see what it matters what i do with it?
[14:38:39] <T13|needsCoffee> Okay BillCriswell
[14:38:48] <Yatekii> eddiemonge: it is defined in the same script just few lines above
[14:38:52] <BillCriswell> Uh oh.
[14:39:01] <T13|needsCoffee> I plugged that all in and jsfiddle says there's a semicolon missing.
[14:39:02] <eddiemonge> naprac: because what you do with changes the best way to get it
[14:39:05] <Yatekii> I can execute moveTo(); in the console and it works fine
[14:39:09] <Yatekii> just not in the on click
[14:39:32] <eddiemonge> Yatekii: what do you mean defined in the same script? its an onclick event
[14:39:34] <BillCriswell> Yatekii: Sounds like you're trying to move something before it exists.
[14:39:42] <Yatekii> no.
[14:39:44] <naprac> i send the values to ajax call
[14:40:04] <Yatekii> https://gist.github.com/Yatekii/52c557fa38e94559d1b4 eddiemonge BillCriswell everything is there
[14:40:14] <eddiemonge> naprac: then get the values before you do that ajax call. it doesnt matter when they were created
[14:40:15] <Yatekii> I just cannot execute the onclick.
[14:40:27] <Yatekii> executing it though console works fine
[14:40:31] <Yatekii> as I told
[14:40:31] <eddiemonge> my eyes!
[14:40:34] <eddiemonge> lol
[14:40:55] <Yatekii> wat
[14:40:56] <eddiemonge> Yatekii: and its exactly what BillCriswell said
[14:41:01] <Yatekii> no its not
[14:41:02] <eddiemonge> you are trying to move it before it exists
[14:41:06] <T13|needsCoffee> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/ShoeMaker/KhFua/
[14:41:19] <Yatekii> wtf no.
[14:41:20] <naprac> eddiemonge: of course thats what i'm trying to do
[14:41:27] <Yatekii> why can I execute it though console then?
[14:41:35] <eddiemonge> Yatekii: because it exists then
[14:41:40] <Yatekii> WTF
[14:41:53] <Yatekii> how can it exist one splitsecond after?
[14:41:54] <eddiemonge> Yatekii: go read up on what .ready() does
[14:41:59] <Yatekii> without changing anything
[14:42:10] <Yatekii> ehhhm
[14:42:20] <Yatekii> I click licke 10 secs after the site was loaded
[14:42:22] <eddiemonge> easy. in your code the js is executed, then the dom is made.
[14:42:23] <Yatekii> *like
[14:42:28] <Yatekii> when everything is built up
[14:42:42] <eddiemonge> Yatekii: http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[14:42:53] <eddiemonge> also, width/height don't exist outside of that dom ready block
[14:43:10] <eddiemonge> naprac: http://api.jquery.com/serialize
[14:43:24] <naprac> eddiemonge: i don't want that
[14:43:41] <Yatekii> eddiemonge: so why can I execute it through console then if it doesn't exist outside that block?
[14:43:43] <eddiemonge> naprac: why not? sounds like what you are doing
[14:43:54] <Yatekii> + when the page is loaded the dom is ready.
[14:43:59] <naprac> eddiemonge: no, i know how to send it to ajax
[14:43:59] <eddiemonge> Yatekii: you don't get a variable is not defined error?
[14:44:00] <Yatekii> so then the click should work
[14:44:06] <Yatekii> eddiemonge: no.
[14:44:33] <Yatekii> look I loaded the paghe 1min before now ... and the DOM should be ready since ages now
[14:44:37] <Yatekii> and the click still does not work
[14:44:39] <naprac> what i don't know is if each can be used on dynamic elements and if so how, the syntax?
[14:45:05] <eddiemonge> Yatekii: it doesnt matter when you fire it. at the moment you try to bind the click event, that element doesnt exist in the dom because the dom hasnt even started to load
[14:45:25] <eddiemonge> either move your code to the bottom, before the </body> or wrap it all in the .ready() block
[14:45:39] <Yatekii> ah kk
[14:45:53] <Yatekii> so it never assigns the click event
[14:46:35] <Yatekii> ok works fine now ty
[14:47:06] <naprac> is there something like change event on form fields?
[14:47:18] <boytoy_> var isMobile = navigator.userAgent.match(/(Mobile|webOS)/); is all I need to match mobile devices right?
[14:47:55] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: Way to many user agent strings to say for certain.
[14:48:09] <T13|needsCoffee> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/ShoeMaker/KhFua/
[14:48:32] <eddiemonge> Yatekii: http://jsbin.com/AneKom/1/
[14:48:42] <eddiemonge> naprac: yes.
[14:48:51] <boytoy_> BillCriswell: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3514784/what-is-the-best-way-to-detect-a-handheld-device-in-jquery has a whole bunch of them but http://scottwb.com/blog/2012/02/23/a-better-way-to-add-mobile-pages-to-a-rails-site/ only lists Mobile and webOS (ive tested the latter on BrowserStack and they seem good to go, just curious what y'all think)
[14:48:56] <eddiemonge> naprac: what is it you are trying to do exactly
[14:49:18] <naprac> get the values from dynamically created input field
[14:49:24] <eddiemonge> boytoy_: do you really need to detect mobile devices?
[14:49:41] <naprac> like changed values
[14:49:51] <boytoy_> eddiemonge: yup im trying to create the perfect mobile experience for my site
[14:49:52] <eddiemonge> naprac: and then send them through ajax right? essentially submitting the form ajax-ically?
[14:49:57] <Yatekii> eddiemonge: ty
[14:50:03] <naprac> yes
[14:50:05] <eddiemonge> boytoy_: why dont you make the site responsive then?
[14:50:12] <eddiemonge> naprac: then whats wrong with serialize()?
[14:50:42] <BillCriswell> Technical_13: shouldn't use onclick inline. Do this instead: http://jsfiddle.net/KhFua/2/
[14:50:46] <naprac> i want to do it manually
[14:51:00] <eddiemonge> naprac: why?
[14:51:15] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: perfect? Damn, good luck!
[14:51:24] <naprac> because it seems to be difficult and it irritates me
[14:51:37] <dcope> is it possible to preload images with chrome?
[14:51:43] <boytoy_> eddiemonge: it is, but in some instances i need to serve different html, js and css for mobile
[14:51:57] <boytoy_> BillCriswell: tq =)
[14:52:01] <eddiemonge> naprac: that makes no sense
[14:52:12] <eddiemonge> dcope: its possible to preload images with javascript
[14:52:30] <eddiemonge> boytoy_: you do?
[14:52:41] <naprac> i know how to do the serialize thing, but i like to do it other way
[14:52:54] <dcope> eddiemonge: hm, any tips? i see the images being requested in chromes web inspector but when i go to swap out an elements background image it's white for a millisecond
[14:53:38] <naprac> what was the change thing you mentioned?
[14:53:48] <petey_> is it possible to insert the datepicker into a nested div? I've got a mega menu - menu dissapears when a date is selected, since it's outside the div
[14:53:52] <eddiemonge> .on('change')
[14:53:57] <petey_> the jquery ui datepicker*
[14:54:10] <boytoy_> eddiemonge: yup like native-like mobile scrolling, text links turned into buttons to encourage tapping, and a buncha stuff that's desktop only like dropdown menus vs jquery mobile side panels etc.
[14:54:17] <BillCriswell> naprac: Are you trying to get like...  { field_name: "value", field_name2: "foo" } instead of [ { name: "field_name", value: "value" } ] ?
[14:54:26] <eddiemonge> dcope: how are you swapping them? is it just the first time you swap them?
[14:55:07] <dcope> eddiemonge: yep, it's just the first time. i'm swapping them like so --> background-image: image-url("albums/player/player-track-background-hover.png");
[14:55:12] <dcope> on a css hover
[14:55:20] <eddiemonge> boytoy_: still sounds like it could be done responsively
[14:56:02] <eddiemonge> dcope: why not toggleClass? and are you sure the correct images are being preloaded? what do you mean you see them loaded in inspector? do you mean the network tab?
[14:56:04] <Technical_13> BillCriswell: http://enwp.org/User:Technical_13/SandBox/Gadget-listStyles.js is where I'm using it.
[14:56:34] <dcope> eddiemonge: yep, network tab
[14:56:38] <dcope> i will try using toggle class
[14:56:47] <boytoy_> eddiemonge: i do have a bunch of media queries though
[14:56:47] <eddiemonge> dcope: why arent you spriting them?
[14:56:56] <Technical_13> I'm kinda stuck in .click(function(e){ e.preventDefault();
[14:57:51] <BillCriswell> Technical_13: How are you stuck?
[14:57:58] <BillCriswell> Not sure I'm following.
[14:58:02] <grafi> he cant escape
[14:58:07] <grafi> :P
[14:58:32] <Technical_13> The resource loader requires it to be in that structure.
[14:58:45] <Technical_13> But it returns I'm missing a ;
[14:59:12] <dcope> eddiemonge: didn't even think about spriting them. it's weird though cause it works in safari fine but not in chrome
[14:59:30] <BillCriswell> Technical_13: after "decimal" should be one, but that shouldn't keep it from working.
[15:01:59] <boytoy_> eddiemonge: for responsive-like JS should i use https://github.com/sparkbox/mediaCheck ?
[15:02:53] <boytoy_> looks kinda nice
[15:03:54] <Technical_13> Meh.. time to restart Firefox... its eating 1.3 gigs of RAM again.
[15:05:30] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: I wouldn't use it till you need it.
[15:07:02] <boytoy_> cool ill try to hold it back as long as i can
[15:09:20] <Technical_13> BillCriswell: that semicolon did it...
[15:09:27] <BillCriswell> Groovy.
[15:10:14] <Technical_13> Well it gave me the link.  Now to test function.
[15:12:56] <Technical_13> Clicking not working... reloading with console... let's see...
[15:13:45] <Technical_13> Seems it's not waiting for the click and running twice on its own.
[15:14:07] <Velveeta> have you tried slapping it on the wrist yet, or yelling at it?
[15:14:30] <Technical_13> ListStyles not defined...
[15:15:37] <Technical_13> That's only in my log... grrr. I can fix that error..
[15:17:21] <eddiemonge> anyone have an idea for an app or site they want to build but dont know how or want a partner?
[15:19:32] <boytoy_> lulz :P
[15:19:59] <Technical_13> Ha!  That is hilarious!
[15:20:23] <Technical_13> BillCriswell: it works on every list EXCEPT the one I want.
[15:20:24] <BillCriswell> eddiemonge: I have no good ideas either. :(
[15:20:34] <BillCriswell> Technical_13: That's how things usually happen.
[15:20:47] <ecurtis> Weird Question: I am intizliaing 2 swipers on my page with this simple code http://jsfiddle.net/Lkx2Q/3/ one returns an object the other as swipe. Both need to be objects...
[15:21:09] <Velveeta> well THAT's a weird question
[15:21:14] <Velveeta> hold on, let me read it now...
[15:21:47] <Technical_13> It's actually adding the code but not changing...
[15:22:07] <Velveeta> ecurtis: those constructors are returning 2 different formats?
[15:22:24] <Technical_13> Means there must be something in the common.css marked !important overriding it.
[15:22:26] <ecurtis> Velveeta: Yes, the first one works too
[15:22:49] <ecurtis> Velveeta: using swipe.js on chrome (been vetted pretty well)....
[15:25:11] <ecurtis> Velveeta: found the bug, I had the object as a class not an ID, thanks
[15:25:26] <Velveeta> glad i could help! :D
[15:28:22] <boytoy_> At this click-to-play thumbnail of this YouTube embed -- http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/49/edit -- what's wrong with the way I've tried to implement jQuery mediaCheck? I'm trying to alternate between thumbnails and iframes that go from 450px to 320px for resolutions lower than 800px.

[15:44:49] <hyperking> Hello i have a question. Can anyone help?
[15:45:26] <sunbeam> does anyone know a good slider plugin that has a progress bar?
[15:47:15] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: cycle2 has ne.
[15:47:18] <BillCriswell> one*
[15:47:57] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: That's what I said.. think it's a bit out of my league haha.
[15:48:02] <talntid> who's the author of that globe jsbin?
[15:48:22] <Velveeta> bill gates
[15:48:29] <BillCriswell> talntid: http://aem1k.com/world/ afaik.
[15:48:33] <hyperking> Is anyone available to answer a question i have?
[15:48:43] <BillCriswell> It's at the top of hacker news
[15:48:46] <Velveeta> hyperking: just ask away
[15:49:03] <BillCriswell> hyperking: Just ask, if someone knows the answer they'll help you I'm sure
[15:50:09] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: amazing
[15:50:15] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: how come i couldn't find this one
[15:50:19] <sunbeam> Just Tried like 3
[15:50:21] <sunbeam> :(
[15:51:22] <hyperking> I am using this filter plugin http://mixitup.io/ but i need to intergrate a hash change to the url if i user clicks a link outside the filter page
[15:51:31] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: I googled "cycle progress bar" because I cycleis pretty popular and i'm sure someone has been forced to add a progress bar at some point to it.
[15:53:04] <hyperking> velvetta: basically i need the filter to automatically filter the item when page loads according to the url hash value
[15:54:12] <BillCriswell> hyperking: It doesn't look like it's built in, which is odd.
[15:56:28] <BillCriswell> hyperking: What does your hash value look like?
[15:57:17] <hyperking> BillCriswell: my hash url looks like " /#food" and yeah, their is a closed github issue claiming to resolve it https://github.com/barrel/mixitup/issues/35
[15:57:17] <b-ot> hyperking: Issue #35 by JBIRD1111 (1mon 1w ago): Applying hash to URL
[15:57:38] <hyperking> b-ot: it does not work!
[15:58:28] <BillCriswell> hyperking: That's a bot. This is along the route I was going to take you. Can you elaborate on "it does not work".
[15:59:13] <hyperking> BillCriswell: here is my code http://jsbin.com/uHIgite/1/
[15:59:56] <hyperking> BillCriswell: i get this error: SyntaxError: function statement requires a name 	  onMixLoad: function(){  	
[15:59:57] <BillCriswell> hyperking: There's errors here.
[16:00:38] <hyperking> BillCriswell: im not jquery savvy at all. looking for some help
[16:02:13] <BillCriswell> hyperking: $('#grid').mixitup({ /* Code you have out in the open. */ });
[16:02:28] <thomze> I have this http://jsfiddle.net/Z72wD/1/ simple little thing, but instead of "hiding" the include and toggle it, could I then somehow "load" and "unload" the include file pr. toggle?
[16:04:13] <hugo_moss> anyone know of a plugin that will morph one image into another?
[16:04:57] <Velveeta> hyperking: you have your onMixLoad declared improperly, it's syntactically invalid for javascript, try something like var onMixLoader = function () {
[16:05:25] <hyperking> BillCriswell: thanks! and thanks Velveeta
[16:05:42] <boytoy_> hugo_moss: like https://github.com/jembezmamy/morpher-js ?
[16:05:52] <BillCriswell> hyperking: worked? awesome.
[16:05:56] <hyperking> is onMixLoad: a parameter? or a function?
[16:06:01] <Velveeta> i can't guarantee it'll work, but that's a starting point
[16:06:21] <hyperking> i never seen it before so i didn't know where to place it
[16:06:24] <Velveeta> it's a function, but it looks like it was ripped out of an object literal setup and pasted into that code
[16:06:47] <boytoy_> Update: At http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/51/edit -- anyone know why $current_maxwidth doesn't seem to work properly inside embedly()?
[16:12:36] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: It seems like it shoudl be query: { maxwidth: whatever }
[16:12:51] <BillCriswell> Oh you do have that.
[16:13:40] <BillCriswell> Eh, i'll be back
[16:13:50] <boytoy_> cool np
[16:14:05] <boytoy_> same here i need to wash my face
[16:17:05] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: hehe ok
[16:44:19] <tetradon> I'm having a problem trying to get this script to sequentially call a function, wait until it's finished, and call another function: http://jsfiddle.net/TWe6A/4/
[16:46:27] <boytoy_> cool fiddle tetradon
[16:46:40] <boytoy_> you starting your own news site?
[16:49:03] <tetradon> boytoy_: yeah basically lol
[16:50:17] <boytoy_> sweet, wish i could help
[16:51:47] <tetradon> boytoy_: It's no problem. Thanks.
[16:54:07] <Lindrian> I am trying to bind a scroll event to a dynamically created div with overflow: auto, but its not working
[16:54:10] <Lindrian> am i missing something here?
[16:54:13] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: Are you expecting $current_maxwidth to get the values from mediaCheck?
[16:54:26] <Lindrian> $(window).on("scroll", "#element", function() {});
[16:54:34] <shoky> tetradon: you're using the deferred wrong
[16:54:38] <Velveeta> try $(document) instead of window
[16:54:53] <Velveeta> also, do scroll events bubble?
[16:55:10] <Lindrian> i tried document, no uck
[16:55:17] <Lindrian> Velveeta: dont know, afraid they might now.
[16:55:20] <Lindrian> not*
[16:55:40] <Velveeta> doesn't look like it: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/scroll.html
[16:55:44] <BillCriswell> Lindrian: http://jsbin.com/oKAJefi/1/edit This seems to work?
[16:55:45] <Velveeta> so that's probably your problem
[16:55:59] <shoky> tetradon: you need to resolve it only when you want its done callback to be called , something more like.. http://jsfiddle.net/TWe6A/5/
[16:56:05] <Velveeta> bill: they're trying to delegate that scroll event
[16:56:29] <BillCriswell> Oh.
[16:56:37] <BillCriswell> It's getting to close to Breaking Bad time.
[16:56:40] <Velveeta> i got a linkedin request from a firefighter in pittsburgh
[16:56:41] <BillCriswell> I can't focus.
[16:56:56] <BillCriswell> That's pretty random.
[16:57:01] <Velveeta> indeed
[16:57:07] <Lindrian> Velveeta: yeah
[16:57:08] <Velveeta> especially considering i'm a front end architect in austin
[16:57:23] <Velveeta> that's like, i don't know how many different circles not overlapping
[16:58:11] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Yeah, that's interesting. I typically just get recruiters.
[16:58:24] <Velveeta> same here
[16:58:28] <BillCriswell> Lindrian: It appears you can't delegate scroll events.
[16:59:12] <BillCriswell> Lindrian: You'll just have to reapply.
[17:00:43] <boytoy_> BillCriswell: Hey, yes I am
[17:00:49] <tetradon> shoky: Thanks, that's it.
[17:02:22] <boytoy_> BillCriswell: how long till breaking bad exactly?
[17:02:29] <tetradon> I was using deferred wrong
[17:02:32] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: 1 hour.
[17:02:44] <boytoy_> nice :D
[17:02:54] <Velveeta> how many episodes left, including this one.. 3?
[17:03:09] <boytoy_> never had much luck with those online timezone converters
[17:03:21] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I believe so.
[17:03:42] <boytoy_> epic
[17:03:49] <Velveeta> so who do we think's gonna win in the end? :D
[17:04:11] <shoky> (awesome site if you wanna keep track of your shows http://www.pogdesign.co.uk/cat/ )
[17:04:17] <BillCriswell> Walt. Not by much, though.
[17:04:50] <boytoy_> then after that they're making a show about saul goodman's past
[17:04:56] <Velveeta> they've already had a few flash forwards, so he definitely survives
[17:05:18] <BillCriswell> shoky: Haha, Breaking Bad is the only show I watch really... well, the only one I'll sit through commercials for.
[17:05:33] <Velveeta> although it was pretty apparent in one of those flash forwards that it was known who he was, spray painted on the inside of his house, so that alludes to him being busted or otherwise outed at some point
[17:05:40] <shoky> no commercials when i watch it :p
[17:05:40] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: There's no saying how far forward it flashes though.
[17:06:28] <Velveeta> well in one of them, it showed his 52nd birthday right?
[17:06:37] <Velveeta> alone at a diner, with a shotgun in his trunk
[17:06:39] <BillCriswell> I think so, all alone.
[17:06:41] <Velveeta> right
[17:06:52] <boytoy_> lol
[17:06:53] <Velveeta> so i was guessing the other ones were a similar timeframe
[17:07:03] <boytoy_> oh man i cant wait
[17:07:13] <BillCriswell> We shall see!
[17:07:17] <Lindrian> BillCriswell: yep
[17:07:34] <boytoy_> :)
[17:07:39] <shoky> i've been watching The Newsroom. pretty great
[17:07:48] <Velveeta> i just ride from one series to the next, and use netflix to fill in the gaps
[17:08:14] <Velveeta> game of thrones got me part of the way to breaking bad, which'll get me most of the way to walking dead, which'll get me part of the way back to game of thrones :D
[17:08:34] <Velveeta> in the meantime, we suck down entire series on netflix like arrested development and psych and the league
[17:08:35] <BillCriswell> I hear Newsroom is great. Still haven't dived in yet.
[17:08:46] <shoky> walking dead and breaking bad are fun but they should die already imo
[17:09:28] <BillCriswell> NEver got into walking dead.
[17:09:32] <boytoy_> shoky: good call, we dont want another lost :)
[17:09:39] <shoky> eh don't get me started on lost
[17:09:49] <boytoy_> hehe
[17:09:56] <shoky> that should've died after 1 season as far as i'm concerned
[17:10:04] <shoky> and i wasn't crazy about the 1st either ;p
[17:10:05] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Arrested Development is great, but not sure I'd get as into it as Breaking Bad.
[17:10:25] <BillCriswell> If I was had HBO and I was alittle older at the time I'd have probably watched Twin Peaks religiously.
[17:10:35] <Velveeta> heheheh
[17:10:43] <Velveeta> i never watched twin peaks, but have heard about it
[17:10:50] <shoky> +++++
[17:11:14] <BillCriswell> I was 7 when it came out. =(
[17:11:37] <BillCriswell> It's really out there and fun and weird.
[17:13:50] <BillCriswell> Oh, it wasn't on HBO, weird. Where did I get that from..
[17:14:19] <shoky> yup that sounded a bit off
[17:15:26] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Dinosaurs is classic.
[17:15:33] <Velveeta> not the mama!
[17:15:44] <Pyche> hey, can anyone take a look at this jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Eajsp/  -- im doing a .change() function on a dropdown, and trying to properly set the correct OPTION from server side code. the "selected=selected" text is apparently being removed  (?) by jquery ?
[17:16:50] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: As a kid I just thought it was funny, but being a bit older now I realize it's really ballsy.
[17:17:40] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcOGY224ILo This episode in particular, I can't believe it ever aired on ABC.
[17:18:24] <Velveeta> heheheh
[17:19:45] <BillCriswell> Hahaha, the god they create in that episode has it's own muppet wiki page: http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/The_Great_Potato
[17:20:37] <BillCriswell> its own*
[17:24:59] <BillCriswell> Pyche: I'm having a hard time following this, when the select changes you want to  query something and update the value of that same select?
[17:27:12] <boytoy_> BillCriswell: why did you ask earlier? should I not be expecting $current_maxwidth to get the values from mediaCheck? (http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/54/edit)
[17:28:01] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: Correct.
[17:29:39] <BillCriswell> shoky: That chewing gum you like is going to come back in style.
[17:30:18] <boytoy_> cool ill try out a few things
[17:31:39] <boytoy_> BillCriswell: which chewing gum is that? :P v6?
[17:31:48] <boytoy_> remember it broke my heart when it got discontinued
[17:31:54] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: Haha, it's a Twin Peaks reference.
[17:32:05] <boytoy_> ohhh..
[17:32:20] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: I like Jeremy Keiths approach for doing things based on screen sizes: http://jsbin.com/ehawax/1/edit
[17:32:22] <boytoy_> oops
[17:32:57] <shoky> BillCriswell: lol wat?
[17:33:14] <BillCriswell> shoky: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0CGzPaJUOE
[17:33:38] <boytoy_> hmmm..
[17:33:42] <BillCriswell> shoky: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=B0CGzPaJUOE#t=215
[17:34:16] <shoky> BillCriswell: lol ;D
[17:34:55] <BillCriswell> That show still gives me the chills.
[17:35:20] <shoky> lynchills
[17:35:52] <shoky> g'nite sirs
[17:35:59] <BillCriswell> Night!
[17:37:44] <DilipRamirez> sup everyone, Is there any guidelines on how to achieve a similar approach of Google Maps (zoomable, draggable "canvas") but with an image gallery?
[17:41:49] <Pyche> BillCriswell: the update works on the dropdown.. it's the initial load that does not work. the server code i add "selected=selected" gets removed by jquery
[17:42:22] <boytoy_> night shoky
[17:45:22] <BillCriswell> Pyche: Are you trying to trigger a change event on page load?
[17:46:14] <Pyche> BillCriswell: no, just a change when a dropdown change occurs (which works)
[17:46:40] <BillCriswell> Pyche: So would triggering a change when the page loads fix it?
[17:46:56] <Pyche> i guess..
[17:47:09] <Pyche> but it's pretty confusing as there are many dropdowns on the page
[17:47:31] <DilipRamirez> any ideas guys ?
[17:47:31] <Pyche> im curious to know why the selected=selected is being removed
[17:47:54] <BillCriswell> It looks like you're targeting on .CreditDrop elements only?
[17:48:25] <Pyche> there are many CreditDrops on the page
[17:48:28] <Pyche> i just posted one
[17:48:33] <Pyche> Dilip: http://www.jacklmoore.com/wheelzoom/
[17:48:44] <Pyche> that work for you?
[17:49:03] <BillCriswell> Are you only trying to fire it off on the first or what? Not sure I'm following right.
[17:49:33] <Pyche> i need to fire a change every time one of the dropdowns changes.. which it does do right now
[17:50:03] <Pyche> but part of the dropdown, i need any previously selected amounts from the dropdown to be selected by default on any future page load
[17:50:34] <Pyche> to mark any pre-selected dropdown amount as 'selected=selected' im using server code (as previously stored amounts are stored in the database)
[17:52:05] <BillCriswell> I think I'd need to see the it. Either you suck at explaining things or I suck at understanding... but most likely it's a little bit of both!
[17:52:34] <Pyche> http://jsfiddle.net/Eajsp/
[17:53:02] <Pyche> the dropdown on the right is autselected 0.05
[17:53:21] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[17:53:30] <Pyche> in my live code, it is not
[17:53:41] <Pyche> the selected=selected code disappears
[17:54:00] <Pyche> i know the server code works.. i outputted it and debugged by removing jquery
[17:54:52] <BillCriswell> So this code is removing the selected="selected" from that dropdown?
[17:55:09] <Pyche> yes
[17:55:41] <DilipRamirez> Psyche oh well I saw that one, but what I need actually is a collection of images being displayed in a big canvas, overflow:hidden with the width and height of the browser size
[17:57:26] <BillCriswell> Pyche: I don't see anything here that would do that.
[17:57:40] <Pyche> heh.. i know!
[18:08:32] <BillCriswell>  /part night!
[18:12:25] <petey_> anyone have any ideas for how i can use jquery datepicker inside a hover menu?
[18:16:52] <briefcaseofguts> anyone know a good visual tour/walkthrough library?
[18:39:18] <greenitalics> hey, anyone here able to help with a quick question?
[18:39:37] <Velveeta> throw it out there
[18:40:42] <greenitalics> so i have a small image db, and when you search, 4 images are supposed to appear
[18:41:13] <greenitalics> but i keep getting the whole html, like <img src=myurl>
[18:41:20] <greenitalics> not the actual image
[18:41:36] <greenitalics> and idk why
[18:41:36] <tw2113> perhaps that's what's stored in the db field
[18:42:22] <greenitalics> well I'm getting the urls from the db yes
[18:42:33] <greenitalics> but why wouldn't they come up as images
[18:42:51] <tw2113> have you checked the db directly to see what's stored in the column?
[18:42:56] <tw2113> also, how is this jQuery related so far
[18:45:06] <petey_> im having some trouble with jquery
[18:45:07] <petey_> http://jsfiddle.net/totalmajor/jL58V/
[18:45:18] <petey_> is it possible to put the datepicker inside an hover state?
[18:45:29] <petey_> so far I get it to appear inside the div, but clicking on a date, doesn't do anything
[18:45:49] <petey_> if i call it the way it should be called it works, but it doesn't work inside that div
[18:46:26] <greenitalics> i guess I'm wondering how you would use jquery to make an image appear where there was initially a <td id="photo">test</td> (all inside a table and such)
[18:46:37] <greenitalics> and the db is definitely just the ing urls
[18:47:00] <tw2113> somewhere in between must be doing some sort of wrapping of the urls
[18:47:21] <petey_> everything works except for the damn date clicking
[18:47:21] <greenitalics> what do you mean by wrapping
[18:47:33] <tw2113> taking your url and making it an image tag
[18:47:48] <tw2113> wrapping the url in the <img src="" /> stuff
[18:48:32] <briefcaseofguts> petey_: one problem is datepicker if its on the first text input of the page, will automatically show when focus'ed, and chrome (other browsers?) auto focus the first field, but yea you want something like $('#myforminputid').hover(function (e) { $(this).datepicker('show'); });
[18:48:36] <greenitalics> yeah so I'm trying to $('#photo')._____ what exactly
[18:48:56] <greenitalics> i tried .html with the img tag and the src=theurl
[18:49:08] <petey_> hey briefcaseofguts, i've got this so far: http://jsfiddle.net/totalmajor/jL58V/
[18:49:20] <greenitalics> but again, i just get that text, not the img itself
[18:49:28] <petey_> so on click the text input, it opens up, but all i can do then is change the months, clicking on the date doesn't put it in the field
[18:49:42] <martisj> morning
[18:50:07] <briefcaseofguts> greenitalics: $('#myimg').attr('src', MyNewURL); is one way
[18:50:25] <greenitalics> so it'd be two lines
[18:50:31] <greenitalics> 1 making the image with some id
[18:50:35] <greenitalics> then that
[18:50:36] <greenitalics> ?
[18:50:44] <briefcaseofguts> naw
[18:50:48] <greenitalics> could i just append .attr to the 1st one
[18:50:49] <Velveeta> great, now i have dethklok playing in my head
[18:51:08] <martisj> how can i check if the on('change') event listener works in ie on input form fields?
[18:51:09] <briefcaseofguts> $('#myTD').html('<img src="'+myImgURL+'"/>')
[18:51:24] <briefcaseofguts> dethklok is great ;]
[18:51:28] <martisj> Our search field tries to search when you change back to Chrome.
[18:51:34] <Velveeta> martisj: alert something on change, and then change it in the browser and watch for the alert?
[18:51:48] <Velveeta> briefcaseofguts: indeed they do ;)
[18:51:54] <martisj> Velveeta: i don't have IE unfortunately :S
[18:52:07] <petey_> any idea of why it's firing but not closing?
[18:52:11] <Velveeta> then why are you asking us how you can test it in IE?
[18:52:18] <petey_> would changing it to hover make a difference vs clicking it?
[18:52:33] <petey_> it appears the way it should, but doesn't close when selecting a date
[18:52:35] <tw2113> that's a fortunate thing in my book martisj
[18:52:41] <Velveeta> you have to have access to a copy of IE in some form, in order to test in IE, whether it's on your machine, or in a VM, or w/ browserstack, or something
[18:52:58] <tw2113> however, if anyone is serious about frontend dev, some sort of way to access IE8+ is a necessity
[18:53:11] <petey_> what difference does it make if im calling datepicker via on: 'click' -> load inside a div
[18:53:16] <tw2113> whether it be a 5 year old laptop that usually collects dust or a VM
[18:53:18] <Velveeta> martisj: are you on a mac?
[18:53:29] <petey_> i boot up a VM with IE8/9/10 if needed
[18:53:39] <Velveeta> because MS distributes VM's that can be used specifically for IE testing
[18:53:54] <petey_> you just get virtualbox and curl the images
[18:53:56] <Velveeta> yeah, i have a VM for win7 with IE8/9, and another with XP w/ IE7 for testing
[18:53:59] <petey_> it's a relatively straightforward process
[18:54:05] <martisj> Velveeta: well it was more a question whether there is some list of events and how they work in various browsers like here: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/    but it doesn't say whether it works well on input fields
[18:54:11] <briefcaseofguts> petey_: .datepicker() initializes the click and focus attributes to the textbox, if u just want to show it (after its initialized) use .datepicker('show')
[18:54:23] <martisj> how do you get windows installed though?
[18:54:28] <Velveeta> martisj: change works fine on input fields, but doesn't actually trigger until the field is blurred
[18:54:36] <tw2113> purchase a copy of windows XP and install it?
[18:54:44] <__equinox> is it possible to supply a parameter on calling trigger?
[18:54:45] <tw2113> if you're going the old computer route
[18:54:51] <martisj> i have tried using virtual box but it's super slow
[18:54:51] <Velveeta> you don't install windows, you install VM software, like vmware or virtual box or something
[18:55:05] <martisj> tw2113: expensive :S
[18:55:12] <Velveeta> super slow is better than not running it at all
[18:55:15] <martisj> i.e. i can't afford that right now is what i mean
[18:55:21] <martisj> Velveeta: words of wisdom
[18:55:21] <petey_> briefcaseofguts: using .datepicker(show) doesn't display anything, it won't load
[18:55:21] <Velveeta> i use vmware fusion, but my company pays for the copy we use
[18:55:35] <briefcaseofguts> http://jsfiddle.net/LGSq2/
[18:55:37] <martisj> and yes I am on a mac
[18:55:43] <martisj> Velveeta: lucky
[18:55:44] <briefcaseofguts> petey_: http://jsfiddle.net/LGSq2/
[18:55:55] <briefcaseofguts> petey_: it probably wasnt initialized or you didnt pass ("show")
[18:56:12] <tw2113> old laptops shouldn't be that expensive
[18:56:29] <tw2113> and should be able to be written off as a business expense :D
[18:56:48] <petey_> ah yeah i just passed (show) :$
[18:57:00] <petey_> is there anyway to get this done without the div dissapearing?
[18:57:16] <petey_> i've got a mega menu with a datepicker inside of it. when i click the date, mega menu dissapears
[18:57:25] <briefcaseofguts> __equinox: not sure what you mean but they are probably already fixed, like usually event triggers pass the event variable and maybe one or two others
[18:57:29] <beancurd> martisj: how old is your mac?
[18:57:34] <petey_> i'd like to ultimately nest the datepicker inside the mega menu so it doesn't close
[18:57:49] <briefcaseofguts> petey_: it seems to work in that fiddle i linked
[18:58:04] <martisj> beancurd: late 2008 or 9 can't remember
[18:59:16] <beancurd> martisj: up the ram and you shouldn't have any problems running xp inside virtualbox.
[18:59:35] <martisj> beancurd: cool thanks :)
[18:59:37] <beancurd> download the free vm's from modern.ie
[18:59:48] <martisj> beancurd: awesome!
[18:59:55] <martisj> been looking for something like that
[19:00:31] <petey_> briefcaseofguts, maybe I'm doing something wrong.. thanks for the help though. I'm going to tinker and see if I can get it working
[19:00:38] <beancurd> iirc there's actually a script somewhere on github that will download and install everything for you, but iirc the defaults will pull down 10+GB of images.
[19:00:40] <briefcaseofguts> petey_: np
[19:01:23] <martisj> beancurd: thanks!!!
[19:01:36] <beancurd> https://github.com/jhogervorst/modern.IE-VM-Installer
[19:01:37] <tw2113> that's a lot of VMs
[19:01:40] <martisj> it's nice that microsoft are providing this !
[19:02:16] <Velveeta> it's part of their good-guy facade these days
[19:02:16] <beancurd> tw2113: win8 - ie10, win7 - ie9, win7 - ie8, winxp - ie6
[19:02:41] <briefcaseofguts> petey_: if you can find the right event, you can preventDefault() or "stop from bubbling"(propigating? forget whats its called in jquery) and stop the lose focus event from bubbling up to the parent menu
[19:03:41] <briefcaseofguts> not sure why Ms would do that, making ie so standard not compliant was their browser-war win vs mozilla
[19:04:32] <beancurd> netscape?
[19:05:54] <petey_> Gah, I get a "settings undefinied"
[19:05:57] <petey_> "settings undefined"
[19:07:33] <tw2113> ah the original browser wars
[19:08:00] <beancurd> the one where microsoft won by default by just bundling ie with windows?
[19:08:14] <briefcaseofguts> yea but after FF
[19:08:18] <briefcaseofguts> and they started losing
[19:08:22] <briefcaseofguts> well market share
[19:08:34] <briefcaseofguts> total ignore every developer and dont care if standards complient
[19:08:46] <beancurd> oh, when FF pulled the giant NYT one page ad?
[19:08:51] <briefcaseofguts> theres probably been 1million questions on stackoverflow about IE compatibility bugs
[19:09:00] <briefcaseofguts> ya
[19:09:20] <beancurd> i thought ie6 was brilliant back in its hey day.
[19:09:44] <martisj> Is there a way I can limit the range of which characters fire the keyup event on input field?
[19:09:49] <petey_> I basically need datepicker to load up inline, but to be functional
[19:10:01] <petey_> right now it's showing up, but nothing is firing minus the next/previous month buttons
[19:11:36] <briefcaseofguts> martisj: $('#myobj').keyup(function (e) { var acceptablechars = [12,13,14]; if (acceptablechars.indexOf(e.keyCode) == -1) return; /* dostuff */ });
[19:11:50] <martisj> briefcaseofguts: awesome. thanks
[19:11:56] <martisj> that's quite elegant as well
[19:12:00] <briefcaseofguts> martisj: np ;D
[19:12:30] <tw2113> beancurd, as it was, for a time
[19:12:44] <tw2113> netscape compared to it was a bit of a pile
[19:12:45] <Velveeta> compared to IE5 it was a work of art
[19:13:16] <petey_> brb
[19:13:25] <briefcaseofguts> petey: u will probably have to control the hide/show of the menu with JS so u can cancel it if the date picker is there, instead of using :hover css
[19:13:35] <petey_> yeah briefcaseofguts
[19:13:40] <petey_> I'm getting there...
[19:13:40] <briefcaseofguts> word
[19:13:47] <petey_> I think I'm going to go with the icon method
[19:13:57] <petey_> setting up an altfield actually inputs the date inside the input box
[19:14:07] <petey_> for whatever reason the way i'm doing it now, the date is being sent somewhere else
[19:14:13] <briefcaseofguts> weird
[19:14:22] <petey_> so i may have to load 2 instances of datepicker and set it up for each individual box
[19:14:41] <petey_> i'm on a time constraint so unfortunately i can't keep tinkering with this as much as i'd like to
[19:29:18] <martisj> beancurd: that modern.ie script was AWESOME!!!
[19:29:23] <martisj> worked right out of the box
[19:29:26] <martisj> snap!!!!
[19:29:35] <martisj> most painless solution in a while!
[19:29:36] <martisj> thnaks
[19:38:30] <beancurd> np.
[19:55:31] <duellsy> i'm trying to move from and old query to 1.10.x, but $('.myform').on('submit', func) doesn't seem to want to work, I was previously using .live() without issue,
[19:55:32] <duellsy> any ideas?
[19:56:34] <briefcaseofguts> doesnt work how, the next page loads anyway?
[19:56:50] <duellsy> FYI the form is loaded via ajax, so not in the initial page load, which is why i previously used .live()
[19:57:40] <duellsy> yeah, it's just not being triggered at all, it just submits the actual form as if it was pure html
[19:58:41] <briefcaseofguts> yea i would try function (e) { e.preventDefault(); /* do ajaxy stuff */ }
[19:59:23] <briefcaseofguts> i did have a problem once where it ignored that and would submit anyway, not sure how i fixed it, probably bound the func to the click handler of the submit btn instead
[19:59:41] <briefcaseofguts> or even preventdefault on the click handler
[19:59:44] <duellsy> yeah, I have that, what I'm getting at is that $('.myform').on('submit', function(e){ } doesn't catch the form submit
[19:59:52] <briefcaseofguts> yea ;/
[19:59:53] <duellsy> my form is loaded via ajax
[20:00:19] <duellsy> .live() used to take care of binding elements that were loaded via ajax
[20:00:23] <duellsy> .on() doesn't seem to
[20:00:45] <briefcaseofguts> try return false at the end of your submit handler func
[20:00:50] <briefcaseofguts> does that stop it?
[20:01:10] <briefcaseofguts> oh
[20:01:32] <duellsy> no no, it's not getting INTO the submit handler from the start, that's my problem ;)
[20:01:37] <briefcaseofguts> yea roger
[20:01:44] <duellsy> :)
[20:02:31] <briefcaseofguts> so you have to bind the submit callback in the success function of the ajax load
[20:04:16] <duellsy> i never had to when using .live() with version 1.7.1
[20:05:35] <briefcaseofguts> well live is for future elemnts, on is only selected elems
[20:06:12] <briefcaseofguts> hmm
[20:06:34] <duellsy> yeah, what I'm after is what is the 1.10.* version, now that .live() is removed?
[20:09:23] <briefcaseofguts> one thing you could do is when its appended is pass the html through $() first, and then u can bind there
[20:09:45] <briefcaseofguts> actually nvm thats the same
[20:09:46] <martisj> when doing this http://jsfiddle.net/martisj/UfXdH/1/, i get this error in the console: Uncaught TypeError: Property '[object Object]' of object #<Object> is not a function
[20:09:49] <martisj> any ideas?
[20:10:59] <duellsy> briefcaseofguts: sorted itâ€¦ can't just blindly swap live() with on(), need to bind to the document, and attach the selectorâ€¦ then i'm all sweet
[20:13:27] <briefcaseofguts> what even do you bind on the document
[20:16:15] <briefcaseofguts> martisj: what line ?
[20:16:26] <dcope> if i have an img inside of a div... i have a click event handler for both the img and the div... is it possible to make sure the click doesn't get passed down to the div if the img is clicked?
[20:17:32] <briefcaseofguts> yourimg.click( function (e) { e.stopPropagation(); });
[20:18:03] <dcope> briefcaseofguts: awesome, that works! thank you! :)
[20:18:06] <dcope> i was trying preventDefault heh
[20:18:13] <briefcaseofguts> coolio, gl
[20:18:27] <martisj> briefcaseofguts: line 4 in jquery.min.js
[20:18:31] <martisj> 1.7.2
[20:18:36] <briefcaseofguts> martisj: what if you dont make the array of keys a var, wouldnt that make it a local variable
[20:18:43] <briefcaseofguts> could be a scope issue -=/
[20:18:55] <martisj> briefcaseofguts: hmm ok thanks
[20:21:25] <martisj> removing var will make it a global variable
[20:21:29] <martisj> using var makes it local
[20:21:53] <briefcaseofguts> yea
[20:21:55] <martisj> according to this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1470488/difference-between-using-var-and-not-using-var-in-javascript
[20:22:32] <briefcaseofguts> i would drop the var and then single step through it in debugger, i cant see whats wrong there
[20:24:34] <briefcaseofguts> anyone know a library to have a never-ending list of sections of a form, that duplicate (ie click add and it clones) i hate writing this crap every time
[21:03:57] <duckgoose> http://haxed.net/windows8.html

[22:43:25] <ksinkar> is there any way to select an html element in jQuery using parent-child-sibling relationships like we do in CSS?
[22:44:07] <tw2113> ksinkar, jquery supports css style selection
[22:44:21] <tw2113> $('#parent > .child')
