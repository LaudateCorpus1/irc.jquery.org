[04:46:06] <ZP4RKER> Hi
[04:47:15] <surianup> Hello all
[04:47:22] <ZP4RKER> How are you?
[04:47:33] <surianup> I m fine
[04:47:39] <surianup> what about you >
[04:47:41] <surianup> ?
[04:47:43] <ZP4RKER> Alright
[04:47:54] <ZP4RKER> Just looking for someone as a web dev partner
[04:48:04] <surianup> ok
[04:48:28] <surianup> in which server side language you work?
[04:48:55] <ZP4RKER> I'm not much server-side
[04:49:30] <ThePhoenixBird> hello guys, sorry to disturb, can someone explain me how to fix the red delete button on this example? https://jsfiddle.net/mnroc3k8/16/
[04:49:59] <ThePhoenixBird> it currently just deletes the first element, and not dynamically created ones
[04:52:33] <surianup> ThePhoenixBird
[04:52:33] <surianup> ThePhoenixBird
[04:52:34] <surianup> ThePhoenixBird use this kwyword
[04:52:43] <surianup> keyword
[04:53:31] <ThePhoenixBird> surianup, can you try to edit the jsfiddle and hit Update to generate an updated version link
[04:53:37] <surianup> for clicking this class get $(this) first and then delete $(this).id
[04:53:52] <ThePhoenixBird> thanks a lot :)
[04:54:59] <surianup> ThePhoenixBird
[04:54:59] <surianup> ThePhoenixBird
[04:54:59] <surianup> ThePhoenixBird I think you got the solution ?
[04:55:19] <ThePhoenixBird> surianup, it just works for the first iteration
[04:55:37] <ThePhoenixBird> surianup, try to hit the green button to add more elements and hit the red one, it doesnt work :(
[04:55:51] <surianup> ThePhoenixBird just try what I have said above
[04:57:07] <surianup> pass the class same as anchor and wrapped div dynamically which can not be the same on itration
[04:57:34] <surianup> and then get by the current one by $(this) and delete that one
[04:57:41] <surianup> it should be work
[04:58:11] <ThePhoenixBird> surianup,  each element has a unique class name filter-row-1 filter-row-2 ... etc... so im using  ("div[class*=' filter-row-']")

[07:05:17] <mrk> fadetoggle
[07:05:32] <oaulakh> ok
[07:06:14] <oaulakh> mrk thanks bro :)
[07:06:27] <mrk> :D
[07:07:45] <oaulakh> mrk but problem, picture is flashing two times
[07:09:46] <mrk> give me url
[07:10:01] <noregret> a window.open() opens a new tab, i want it to open a new window, is it possible?
[07:10:47] <mrk> window.open('url','_blank')
[07:12:41] <Xatenev> noregret: mrk: wtf?
[07:12:54] <Xatenev> window.open() opens a new browser window defaultly
[07:13:03] <Uhkis> noregret: no, it depends on the browser settings
[07:13:04] <Xatenev> while _blank opens a new tab (if you didnt override it with your browser settings)
[07:13:15] <noregret> ok thanks
[07:14:56] <noregret> can I somehow get data from such window? i want to open a window, add some data and get it back in order to display it in an elment. is this possible? (the window adds to a db) - not sure if i'm clear
[07:15:16] <noregret> or idk, maybe a trigger an event after closing it..
[07:15:28] <Xatenev> noregret: wtf?
[07:15:36] <Xatenev> noregret: theres no need to open a new page in order to do >anything<
[07:15:38] <Xatenev> noregret: ajax?
[07:16:15] <noregret> Xatenev: true, well, i'm looking for something faster, but i guess i'll do it in ajax
[07:16:22] <Xatenev> ???
[07:16:25] <Xatenev> how is ajax not fast exactly?
[07:16:34] <Xatenev> if your ajax isnt fast the problem isnt ajax but your page.
[07:16:35] <noregret> Xatenev: the backend i mean
[07:16:51] <noregret> ok wait, i'm not talking about fast performance
[07:16:59] <noregret> it's about setting the code and whatnot
[07:17:03] <Xatenev> ah
[07:17:07] <Xatenev> well code speed is no factor
[07:17:09] <Xatenev> actually
[07:17:20] <Xatenev> if you wanna get a good product, take the time
[07:17:23] <noregret> it's about set up
[07:17:26] <noregret> yeah got it
[07:28:42] <Duikb00t> yo
[07:29:54] <Duikb00t> I am using 'http://foundation-datepicker.peterbeno.com/example.html' and I fetch the date that the person has selected.
[07:30:28] <Duikb00t> But I want to check if this date is in a period which is allowed, so the user can select a date from a calendar but maybe he changed it to the date he want in the input text value
[07:30:39] <Duikb00t> I don't want to let the user manually change the date
[07:31:36] <Duikb00t> http://i.imgur.com/bQGQZDt.png   Screenshot
[07:32:09] <Duikb00t> What I have tried : https://www.pastery.net/tnxdwn/
[07:32:19] <Duikb00t> But I think that way I am checking strings and not dates?
[07:44:45] <Duikb00t> Ok sweet I concerted the input string to a date.
[08:06:32] <surianup> #wordpress
[08:06:59] <Duikb00t> Is a channel.
[08:07:57] <surianup> yes this is a channel
[08:08:54] <awkwardCough> I am glad we can all agree that channels exist.
[08:08:56] <Tsutsukakushi> the license is not accessible for tor users
[08:09:12] <Tsutsukakushi> this is result of jquery.org using CloudFlare
[08:09:45] <Tsutsukakushi> by using CloudFlare the jquery project is actively contributing to censorship, surveillance and weakening encryption on the internet
[09:16:46] <hackinghorn> is it true that I can replace every jquery code with pure javascript
[09:17:03] <taplar> sure
[09:17:09] <taplar> jquery is javascript
[09:42:52] <bojanlazic> can someone tell me what's wrong here, http://jsfiddle.net/rzJq9/135/ im trying to show 6 items in 2 row when full width and one item when mobile width
[10:01:19] <Jeroen2_> Hi there, I just added angular to my project but now my JQuery doesn't work anymore. Anyone tackled this problem before ? :)
[11:18:44] <islalobo> Hello, I'm trying to use bootstrap 3 jquery datepicker to link two fields http://kopy.io/UOV4o
[11:52:21] <pmercado> Hi, I'm looking for a plugin like this: https://github.com/headjump/arrows-and-boxes  that draw arrows to connect few things, any suggestion?
[11:55:30] <mmmveggies> why *like* that one, and not that one ?
[12:46:00] <dmatos91> Is there any way I can recreat this effect, but instead of doing it from left to right, start in the triangle's hypoteneuse and end on its top right vertex? https://jsfiddle.net/gvoehd2h/
[13:12:06] <kellyelton> Hey, quick question. not sure how to frame this right to find an answer online. $.ajax(). Is the construction and sending of this synchronous?  For example, if you look here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest#send() it says 'Sends the request. If the request is asynchronous (which is the default), this method returns as soon as
[13:12:06] <kellyelton> the request is sent.'. I'm not sure if jQuery follows this as well? I'm just trying to figure out, if I do a $.ajax() call, and then follow that with, as an example, another $.ajax call, or maybe some code that will download images or whatever, will this ajax call always at least initiate before returning from the method so that it's first in the list of
[13:12:06] <kellyelton> things the browser is downloading?
[13:14:06] <kellyelton> so, does $.ajax return after the request is sent? or is it possible that the browser could go make some other network call before it actually sends
[13:14:41] <taplar> i don't know that i would rely on it being in a certain order
[13:15:16] <taplar> i mean, javascript giving the request to the browser, really up to the browser at that point of how to handle it
[13:15:56] <kellyelton> so my problem: I'm trying to find a way to run some code after the request is started, but before it gets back...otherwise I end up in a situation where my ajax call gets blocked by getting stuffed at the bottom of a queue of items to be downloaded
[13:17:00] <kellyelton> Yeah I suppose so
[13:18:33] <robertmaxrees> kellyelton the order should be irrelevant imo.
[13:28:26] <kellyelton> Browser can only process so many requests at once
[13:29:04] <robertmaxrees> sure?  that doesn't matter.
[13:29:10] <robertmaxrees> you can handle things in whatever order you'd like.
[13:29:29] <kellyelton> I'm not sure what you're getting at
[13:29:45] <robertmaxrees> the beauty of async programming.
[13:30:08] <robertmaxrees> so you have 2 things that need to happen, right?
[13:31:15] <kellyelton> this is all kind of meta conversation and doesn't really apply here
[13:31:34] <robertmaxrees> sure it does - i'm trying to understand the specific problem you're having.
[13:32:10] <kellyelton> I have one function in a library that when it fires queues up ~50 images or so download, that can sometimes be really slow, and then an ajax method I want to fire right before I fire that one...I'd like to make sure my ajax call doesn't get stuffed to the bottom of a queue and delay things. At least that was the plan.
[13:32:52] <robertmaxrees> aaaah, so you just want to make sure the first one finishes without getting "held up" by the other requests.
[13:33:07] <kellyelton> right
[13:33:16] <kellyelton> well not even finishes, just gets queued
[13:33:23] <robertmaxrees> so like, you could try to rely implicitly on the order you fire the requests, but how long does that other request normally take
[13:33:43] <robertmaxrees> because i wouldn't rely on that order - it's not guaranteed.
[13:33:59] <kellyelton> so right now I call the $.ajax method first and then the other method, but I was looking around to see if there was any documentation on if queuing requests is fully synchronus or not
[13:34:10] <robertmaxrees> it's sort of sync, yeah.
[13:34:26] <robertmaxrees> like, it is, but there's no guarantee that it'll always be that way, if that makes sense
[13:35:18] <robertmaxrees> so if that first request is pretty quick, i'd stick the other ajax call in the .done() of that one.  i know that's a scenario you wanted to avoid, but it might be worth it depending on how important it is.
[13:35:23] <kellyelton> Yeah...well the ajax call is generally quicker, but somtimes can be slow...the images once finally cached can be quick, but they run off some expensive backend rendering junk so are also generally slow, but are less important immediatly...more important to get the results of the ajax call
[13:35:24] <kellyelton> first
[13:35:30] <kellyelton> yeah I get ya
[13:36:38] <tenthshift> looking for some datatables help; is this the right channel for that?
[13:36:47] <tenthshift> or a good channel at least?
[13:36:50] <robertmaxrees> eh, sorta?
[13:36:55] <robertmaxrees> tenthshift you can ask, but there's no guarantee you'll get help.
[13:37:01] <robertmaxrees> really wish they'd just make an IRC channel already.
[13:37:04] <Uhkis> tenthshift: at least we get a ton of those exact questions ;)
[13:37:05] <tenthshift> haha that's about the best I can ask for
[13:37:08] <kellyelton> thanks for the help
[13:37:14] <robertmaxrees> tenthshift also: they've got forums :)
[13:37:19] <tenthshift> and yeah I saw the IRC channel thread on their forum
[13:37:33] <tenthshift> with the creator basically saying "meh, I spend too much time doing other stuff to be on IRC"
[13:37:38] <tenthshift> anyway
[13:37:44] <robertmaxrees> the tragedy is that he doesn't need to actually be there.
[13:37:48] <tenthshift> right!
[13:37:58] <tenthshift> the space just needs to exist and people will congregate
[13:38:03] <tenthshift> real quick:
[13:38:16] <Uhkis> tenthshift: join #datatables and wait for them to come, tada! :)
[13:38:25] <tenthshift> 		$('#example').DataTable().column(7).search( /\b([0-46-9])\b/gm, true, false).draw();
[13:38:29] <tenthshift> ^ why doesn't this work
[13:38:45] <tenthshift> I realize this is leaving out some context, but assume basically normal datatables setup
[13:39:06] <tenthshift> column 7 has integers, I'm looking to exclude everything with a "5"
[13:39:30] <tenthshift> when I click the DOM element which triggers that bit of code, my table filters to nothing
[13:40:07] <tenthshift> the regex works though, as seen here: https://regex101.com/r/wB2eK3/5
[13:40:19] <tenthshift> I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong
[13:41:25] <tenthshift> The actual data has like 350 rows, all numbers 1-7 in that column. There should be like 40 that aren't the number 5
[13:41:38] <robertmaxrees> do you have a fiddle or something for people to play with?
[13:41:42] <robertmaxrees> much more likely to get help that way,'
[13:41:48] <tenthshift> I don't offhand, and good point
[13:41:54] <tenthshift> I'll take a second here and make one
[13:42:07] <robertmaxrees> plus it might help you solve your problem :)
[13:43:20] <Uhkis> tenthshift: isn't that code missing the input part for search?
[13:43:44] <tenthshift> Uhkis I don't think so, but it's possible
[13:43:51] <tenthshift> the input is supposed to be the regex
[13:43:53] <Uhkis> https://datatables.net/reference/api/column%28%29.search%28%29
[13:44:06] <Uhkis> input is the first and only non-optional argument
[13:44:13] <tenthshift> si
[13:44:24] <tenthshift> input in this case is the regex
[13:44:31] <tenthshift> the parameter titled regex is a bool
[13:44:42] <tenthshift> which in my snippet is set to 'true'
[13:45:10] <hlvwrk> you're a bool
[13:45:32] <Uhkis> :D
[13:45:35] <hlvwrk> :D\
[13:48:36] <tenthshift> lol
[13:48:54] <tenthshift> I can never set up fiddles right when using an external library like datatables
[13:49:11] <robertmaxrees> what's the link you're using?
[13:49:34] <Uhkis> make sure you use the same protocol
[13:49:47] <robertmaxrees> and that you're using the right link in the first place.
[13:49:52] <robertmaxrees> can't just link from github, for instance.
[13:50:03] <tenthshift> am linking from https://cdn.datatables.net/t/dt/dt-1.10.11/datatables.min.js
[13:50:08] <tenthshift> and the other one for the CSS
[13:50:14] <robertmaxrees> show us the fiddle, then?
[13:50:17] <Uhkis> tenthshift: you can show the incomplete one too
[13:50:29] <tenthshift> it's not quite done, let me paste in the last important part
[13:50:56] <Uhkis> well yeah, the code should be there :)
[13:51:50] <tenthshift> also am using a JSON object full of live data
[13:51:56] <tenthshift> let me sanitize it a tiny bit right quick
[13:52:28] <tenthshift> by which I mean remove people's names
[13:57:07] <tenthshift> https://jsfiddle.net/jz0x2r4r/
[13:57:09] <tenthshift> okay
[13:57:26] <robertmaxrees> your missing a closing paren fwiw.
[13:57:59] <tenthshift> robertmaxrees, where at?
[13:58:31] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[13:58:47] <robertmaxrees> looks like you're missing a final });
[13:59:13] <ace05> hi
[13:59:35] <ace05> any ruby on rails people here?
[14:00:22] <tenthshift> it looks like that yeah
[14:00:25] <tenthshift> but I don't see why
[14:01:20] <robertmaxrees> ace05 lol since this is #jquery not really the right place ;)
[14:01:42] <ace05> hi robertmaxrees
[14:01:47] <ace05> i know:)
[14:02:16] <ace05> but yu can use jquery in ruby on rails on the front end
[14:05:41] <robertmaxrees> ace05 is your question about jquery then?
[15:10:08] <_TWG_> Can anyone help me with an issue I'm having on my promise
[15:10:09] <_TWG_> http://kopy.io/4QBb1#LN2gxyFIjmMrZE
[15:10:39] <_TWG_> When it runs it removes all of the disabled classes instead of just two of them since only two of my 12 files exist.
[15:11:36] <robertmaxrees> you want .apply($, promises) btw.
[15:12:16] <_TWG_> Thanks robertmaxrees
[15:12:17] <robertmaxrees> and is promises an actual array oor...?  and what is tempData?
[15:12:21] <robertmaxrees> lots of stuff i can't see here.
[15:13:05] <robertmaxrees> also: $['a[href="#' + currentObject.hyperlink + '"]').attr('data-toggle', 'tab').parent().removeClass('disabled'); _TWG_
[15:13:15] <robertmaxrees> you hyavea square bracket where you want a paren
[15:13:21] <_TWG_> Sorry about that.  tempData is an array of months.  Each month is populated based on if a CSV file is present in a data folder.
[15:13:41] <robertmaxrees> so $['a[href="#' + currentObject.hyperlink + '"]') should be $('a[href="#' + currentObject.hyperlink + '"]')
[15:14:30] <_TWG_> Sorry, had to retype that between two different systems.
[15:14:53] <_TWG_> What you corrected was correct in my original code.
[15:15:43] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[15:15:46] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[15:16:02] <robertmaxrees> might want to pair this down into just the data you need.
[15:17:04] <_TWG_> Well our IT department is providing a financial dump file for each month and they want all 12 months shown but only want them active when the data file is present.
[15:17:49] <robertmaxrees> that... doesn't help me at all.
[15:21:14] <_TWG_> Okay.  Thanks.
[15:21:26] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see an example of the data and the page.
[15:21:37] <robertmaxrees> i might make sure that selector is actually matching something.
[15:21:49] <_TWG_> Okay.  That will take a while for me to recreate to show.
[15:21:56] <robertmaxrees> erm
[15:22:01] <robertmaxrees> i don't want the whole thing.
[15:22:19] <robertmaxrees> also, you're not using map correctly there.
[15:22:24] <_TWG_> Well for me to recreate what you need between the two systems, it will take a bit.
[15:22:33] <_TWG_> That's how I was told to use it here.
[15:22:37] <robertmaxrees> uh...
[15:22:46] <robertmaxrees> .map() is for transforming an array in one format to another.
[15:23:00] <robertmaxrees> either way, all i need is an example tempData with like 3 or 4 entries.
[15:23:01] <robertmaxrees> start there.
[15:24:04] <hellyeah> hety
[15:24:41] <hellyeah> taplar:  are you there? Can i ask your criticsm about last draft of my code?
[15:31:29] <hellyeah> taplar:  this is my code http://jsfiddle.net/eyg50d75/2/
[15:34:06] <taplar> heh, so i'm the critic? :)
[15:34:31] <taplar> what are you wanting critiqued?  anything in particular?
[15:35:19] <hellyeah> well
[15:35:53] <hellyeah> is it structured well?
[15:36:02] <hellyeah> algorithm flow
[15:36:06] <hellyeah> using delegation
[15:36:15] <hellyeah> calling function with this way
[15:36:22] <hellyeah> function name, variable name etc.
[15:36:27] <hellyeah> global lookup etc.
[15:36:32] <hellyeah> ofc if you have time
[15:36:38] <hellyeah> i try to develop myself
[15:36:46] <robertmaxrees> literally nothing in eventDelegationJobs is delegated btw.
[15:36:50] <hellyeah> i really put some effort to make this clean and readable code
[15:36:50] <taplar> eventDelegationJobs, your not really doing delegates
[15:37:17] <taplar> the multiple click handlers could possibly be combined
[15:37:38] <robertmaxrees> also, you're missing a lot of semicolons.
[15:37:39] <hellyeah> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[15:38:00] <hellyeah> i suppose this is delegation hmm
[15:38:10] <hellyeah> semicolons where
[15:38:12] <taplar> you didn't read all of that apparently, :)
[15:38:14] <robertmaxrees> $('.body') - store selectors like this in a var and reuse them.
[15:38:17] <hellyeah> i didnt get any error
[15:38:33] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah because the browser is helping you out.
[15:38:39] <robertmaxrees> removeTodayHighlighting() - missing a semi after this.
[15:38:40] <hellyeah> ic
[15:38:55] <robertmaxrees> every time you use it it looks like.
[15:39:02] <arc_> i'm never missing a semi if u know what i mean
[15:39:20] <robertmaxrees> thinks like
[15:39:20] <robertmaxrees>   		var dropdownObject = {
[15:39:20] <robertmaxrees>   			"Capability Center 1": "İzleme Sistemleri Yönetimi Alt Gr.",
[15:39:20] <robertmaxrees>   			"Capability Center 2": "Sistem Yönetimi ve Veri Saklama Alt Gr.",
[15:39:20] <robertmaxrees>   			"Capability Center 3": "Network Yazılım Alt Gr."
[15:39:20] <robertmaxrees>   		};
[15:39:23] <robertmaxrees> woops - bad paste
[15:39:27] <taplar> robert!
[15:39:34] <robertmaxrees> SORRY UGH :<
[15:39:35] <decx> why i oughta
[15:39:37] <taplar> lmao
[15:39:41] <hellyeah> dpaste
[15:39:45] <robertmaxrees> either way, store that outside the var.
[15:39:48] <hellyeah> is a good website
[15:39:48] <robertmaxrees> err, function.
[15:39:57] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you rebuild it every time you run that function.
[15:40:00] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  globally?
[15:40:15] <taplar> the binding for 'jqxCalendar' is doing an anonymous function for a simple function call, you could just give it the function like you were up top
[15:40:16] <robertmaxrees> in your dom ready.
[15:40:19] <taplar> same for the binding below it
[15:40:43] <hellyeah> sec
[15:40:47] <robertmaxrees> also, very little of this logic actually needs to be in a doc ready.
[15:41:06] <taplar> lv 47-49 could be done with a map
[15:41:14] <taplar> save some appends
[15:41:55] <taplar> ln 54 your mixing vanilla lookups up in jquery code
[15:42:11] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/eyg50d75/3/line 17
[15:42:39] <taplar> make sure to tidy your code
[15:42:42] <hellyeah> i have $(function(){ robertmaxrees
[15:42:48] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah that's a document ready :)
[15:42:53] <hellyeah> yes
[15:42:59] <robertmaxrees> and line 9 is still missing a semicolon.
[15:43:21] <hellyeah> i said because oof "very little of this logic actually needs to be in a doc ready."
[15:43:33] <robertmaxrees> right.  so it doesn't need to be in that.
[15:44:05] <hellyeah> taplar:  in line 47 map instead of each?
[15:44:21] <robertmaxrees> (function() { /* your code here */ }()); - you use an IIFE and then only put things in the doc ready into the doc ready.  you can even nest your doic ready inside the iife
[15:44:22] <taplar> ln 51
[15:45:08] <taplar> same on ln 80
[15:45:12] <hellyeah> nest you doic
[15:45:14] <hellyeah> ?
[15:45:20] <taplar> pretty much any where your doing an append in an each
[15:45:56] <hellyeah> forgot to change one line to jquery from js :d
[15:46:38] <hellyeah> taplar:  what do you see in line 80?
[15:46:48] <taplar> an append in an each
[15:47:33] <hellyeah> it is line 80 here  $('.seconddropdown').prop('disabled', false);
[15:47:43] <taplar> i did a tidy on your code
[15:47:48] <taplar> tidy your code dude
[15:47:49] <hellyeah> hmm
[15:47:57] <hellyeah> i forgot i am sorry
[15:48:18] <hellyeah> taplar:  do i have improvement?
[15:48:20] <taplar> the logic around 140 seems like it makes some weird arrays
[15:48:32] <taplar> seems like you could just inline the array creation and passing
[15:49:34] <taplar> haven't looked into it more but if getDatesFromCurrentDatePickers is being called multiple times, then that binding will happen multiple times
[15:50:07] <hellyeah> it can be called many times
[15:50:17] <taplar> so that's a problem
[15:50:33] <hellyeah> because you can create many elements
[15:50:40] <hellyeah> how can i get over it?
[15:50:50] <taplar> i'll let you think on that one
[15:50:55] * taplar is still reading
[15:51:07] <hellyeah> sure thank you
[15:51:11] <hellyeah> appreciated
[15:51:24] <hellyeah> i tried to show some efforts on this
[15:51:43] <taplar> ok, so explain this to me
[15:51:58] <taplar> colorizingCalendar(date);
[15:52:15] <taplar> your passing it an array containing a single element, which is an array with two dates
[15:52:35] <taplar> which later calls 'splittedArray'
[15:52:42] <taplar> which does a double map over the array of an array
[15:52:52] <taplar> why do you need the outer array?
[15:53:51] <hellyeah> let me try to explain a sec
[15:53:56] <taplar> (Number(parametrizedArray[0][1]) - 1) <-- that's not very readable
[15:54:40] <hellyeah> first i got the dates with the format ../../..
[15:54:55] <taplar> there's a function called 'anotherFunction'
[15:54:58] <hellyeah> then i splitted('/');
[15:55:13] <hellyeah> then i got into two array
[15:55:15] <hellyeah> i mean
[15:55:21] <hellyeah> arrays of array of array
[15:55:28] <hellyeah> thats for tooltip
[15:55:55] <hellyeah> just select the dates that colorize abover calendar
[15:55:59] <taplar> splitting the string in the array, doesn't tell me anything of why that array needs to be contained in an array
[15:56:03] <taplar> that will only ever have one element
[15:56:03] <hellyeah> and hover over the colorized date
[15:56:08] <hellyeah> you will see tooltip
[15:57:13] <hellyeah> well splice function makes an array right?
[15:57:31] <taplar> split does
[15:57:37] <hellyeah> first i avbe arr[arr, arr)
[15:57:55] <hellyeah> then i split those arrays with /
[15:57:56] <taplar> [[ start, end ]]
[15:58:15] <hellyeah> yes [[start, end]]
[15:58:23] <taplar> why does that have to be in an array?
[15:58:29] <taplar> why not just [ start, end ]
[15:58:48] <hellyeah> hmm
[15:59:03] <hellyeah> i may not need date array then
[15:59:12] <hellyeah> hmm
[15:59:15] <hellyeah> well
[15:59:21] <hellyeah> wait
[15:59:47] <hellyeah> i put start and end to the array and then put another array to have those in same index
[15:59:55] <taplar> ?
[16:00:04] <taplar> you only have one element
[16:00:36] <hellyeah> between.push(start);  between.push(end);   date.push(between);
[16:00:44] <taplar> right, date only has one element
[16:00:48] <hellyeah> date array have start and end in the same index
[16:00:54] <taplar> right
[16:00:58] <taplar> why does that matter?
[16:01:03] <hellyeah> but it may not be necessary
[16:01:07] <hellyeah> right
[16:01:47] <hellyeah> i can have arr[0][0] and arr[1][0] for excample instead of arr[0][0] and arr[0][1] right
[16:02:03] <taplar> that's really unreadable
[16:02:31] <hellyeah> and also this -1 thing is because datepickers'months based on 1th index
[16:02:42] <hellyeah> whereas setfullyear is based on 0th index
[16:02:53] <taplar> none of that improves readability
[16:03:41] <taplar> does your fiddle actually do the colorizing right now?
[16:03:53] <hellyeah> yes
[16:04:06] <hellyeah> you can colorize above calendar as many timne as you want
[16:04:07] <taplar> what do i have to do to make it do it?
[16:04:20] <hellyeah> well
[16:04:33] <hellyeah> first of, create input boxes with create button
[16:04:39] <hellyeah> then select the dates
[16:04:41] <taplar> ok, i got it
[16:05:18] <hellyeah> taplar:  i will fix array issue
[16:05:25] <hellyeah> i dont need date array
[16:08:30] <taplar> k, so we've suggested a few things.  see what you can do about those
[16:09:42] <taplar> and i think i've said this before, but you should consider using the font awesome or boostrap icon classes
[16:11:16] <hellyeah> ,font awesome bootstrap button class
[16:11:22] <hellyeah> let me note it
[16:11:27] <taplar> they are two different libraries
[16:11:39] <hellyeah> i am aware
[16:12:59] <albedoa> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/YqPpwr i want this box to animate into my mouse position but it's acting weird. can anyone identify what i'm doing wrong?
[16:13:05] <albedoa> .css() works btw
[16:13:29] <hellyeah> taplar:  what else?
[16:13:35] <hellyeah> any fixes for me
[16:15:29] <taplar> we told you a few things to work on
[16:16:21] <hellyeah> okey date array
[16:16:34] <taplar> and using map instead of an append in the each
[16:16:39] <taplar> and caching your lookups
[16:16:40] <hellyeah> i understand this
[16:16:55] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:16:55] <taplar> and possibly combining logic instead of attaching multiple event handlers
[16:18:11] <hellyeah> map in what line?
[16:18:30] <taplar> "and using map instead of an append in the each "
[16:18:43] * hellyeah my eyes hurts
[16:19:02] <hellyeah> map instead of append?
[16:19:05] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:19:20] <dougx1> albedoa: you arent giving it any time to accelerate. 40ms interval is wasteful
[16:19:54] <dougx1> or change title to "cell phone battery killing utility"
[16:20:01] <hellyeah> taplar:  http://jsfiddle.net/eyg50d75/5/
[16:20:14] <dougx1> albedoa: why not on mousemove??
[16:20:35] <albedoa> dougx1 thanks, increasing the interval does help
[16:20:52] <albedoa> dougx1 set a delay inside mousemove you think?
[16:20:56] <dougx1> albedoa: making the interpolation function 'linear' will help
[16:21:01] <hellyeah> it worked
[16:21:10] <hellyeah> how it didnt ptompt an error
[16:21:20] <dougx1> albedoa: it won't need to accelerate for 'linear'
[16:21:20] <hellyeah> dont get it map has this functionality also?
[16:21:35] <albedoa> dougx1 thanks!
[16:21:57] <dougx1> np
[16:22:38] <taplar> hellyeah: not sure what you changed
[16:23:05] <hellyeah> taplar:  $('.body').map($datePart);
[16:23:41] <taplar> huh?
[16:23:47] <taplar> line #, and that's invalid
[16:25:32] <hellyeah> i dont understand what line exactly i need to change
[16:25:44] <hellyeah> map instead of append in each
[16:25:47] <taplar> -any where- that you are doing an append to an element inside of an each
[16:26:01] <hellyeah> i understand may be i am blind
[16:26:07] <hellyeah> i couldnt see each
[16:26:08] <taplar> you should map the elements and append the results
[16:26:08] <hellyeah> :p
[16:27:32] <hellyeah> can you give me some little fixes :)
[16:27:43] <hellyeah> or not :d
[16:27:45] <taplar> have you fixed those eaches?
[16:28:45] <hellyeah> oh
[16:28:47] <hellyeah> ic now
[16:28:51] <hellyeah> i am sorry
[16:30:44] <hellyeah> taplar:  http://jsfiddle.net/eyg50d75/6/ but got Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'addCultureInfo' of undefined(anonymous function) @ (index):688(anonymous function) @ (index):745fire @ jquery-2.1.3.js:3094self.add @ jquery-2.1.3.js:3140jQuery.fn.ready @ jquery-2.1.3.js:3373jQuery.fn.init @ jquery-2.1.3.js:2816jQuery @ jquery-2.1.3.js:76(anonymous function) @ (index):352jQuery.event.dispatch @ jquery-2.1.3.js:4430elemData.han
[16:30:59] <taplar> o_O
[16:31:56] <taplar> that's not how you use map
[16:32:02] <taplar> your using map else where.
[16:32:09] <taplar> what is your confusion?
[16:32:44] <hellyeah> you use map instead of each right?
[16:32:48] <taplar> yes
[16:33:13] <hellyeah> map iterates the array
[16:33:19] <dougx1> map is for going through the elements of a selector, and building a new selector with the elements the map callback returns
[16:33:39] <taplar> 'new selector'?
[16:33:41] <taplar> ;)
[16:33:56] <dougx1> new jQuery with an element list
[16:34:04] <hellyeah> taplar:  http://jsfiddle.net/eyg50d75/7/
[16:34:08] <taplar> only true if your using $.fn.map
[16:34:28] <dougx1> map is nonsense if you discard the result
[16:34:34] <dougx1> it is just each + waste
[16:34:53] <taplar> so you changed it to a map, but your still appending
[16:34:55] <taplar> dude
[16:35:08] <taplar> you can append an array of things to an element
[16:35:13] <taplar> that's the point
[16:35:39] <taplar> you take what you have, create the elements you need from them with map, and append the resulting array
[16:35:41] <dougx1> if you append a jquery that has multiple elements in it, then multiple elements get appended
[16:35:54] <taplar> jquery behind the scenes will put it in a document fragment so it only redraws once
[16:36:10] <hellyeah> i dont need append?
[16:36:16] <taplar> i just said you du
[16:36:17] <taplar> do
[16:36:25] <taplar> read what i said...
[16:37:43] <hellyeah> sorry i understand but what did i do wrong?
[16:37:54] <taplar> you asked if you needed append
[16:38:05] <taplar> i -just- told you what you needed to do
[16:39:26] <hellyeah> it is almost 12 a.m.
[16:39:27] <hellyeah> :p
[16:39:32] <hellyeah> let me read again
[16:39:38] <dougx1> taplar: you are trying to say "dont do each and .append" each one, instead, .map the inputs and bang it in with one .append of the .map result?
[16:39:51] <taplar> yep
[16:40:16] <hellyeah> but i have three different cases?
[16:40:20] <dougx1> hellyeah: do you follow that?
[16:40:20] <taplar> ?
[16:40:29] <hellyeah> and each time when you select smt from firstdropdown
[16:40:37] <hellyeah> the result of second dropdown changes
[16:40:40] <taplar> hellyeah: what's your latest fiddle?
[16:41:22] <hellyeah> taplar:  http://jsfiddle.net/eyg50d75/8/ select smt from first dropdown and you will see changes select another thing and check second dropdown
[16:41:54] <taplar> what line did you change to try to use map?
[16:42:17] <hellyeah>       jQuery.map(capacityCenter1, function(key, value) {
[16:42:21] <taplar> line
[16:42:26] <taplar> it's a large fiddle dude
[16:42:56] <arc_> line number
[16:43:26] <hellyeah> line 75
[16:43:35] <taplar> ok
[16:43:38] <hellyeah> but youy may not see what i saw in line 75
[16:43:40] <taplar> so what are you doing?
[16:45:07] <hellyeah> line 75,82 and 91 http://jsfiddle.net/eyg50d75/9/
[16:45:15] <taplar> tell me what your doing
[16:45:20] <taplar> explain it to me
[16:45:22] <hellyeah> i iterate the jquery array
[16:45:27] <hellyeah> object*
[16:45:34] <hellyeah> they have key and value
[16:45:56] <robertmaxrees> that's not what you're doing on 91 at all fwiw.
[16:46:06] <robertmaxrees> you're just enumerating an object.
[16:46:14] <hellyeah> i give key as valu and value as text then append it to seconddropdown
[16:46:17] <robertmaxrees> same with t5 and 81
[16:46:23] <robertmaxrees> *85
[16:46:31] <robertmaxrees> err, you know what i mean haha
[16:46:42] <taplar> so your appending inside a map?
[16:46:58] <hellyeah> what i saw is jquery.map in 75,82,91 robertmaxrees
[16:47:03] <hellyeah> taplar:  is it false?
[16:47:07] <taplar> focus on ln 75 for now
[16:47:12] <hellyeah> sure
[16:47:15] <dougx1> hellyeah: instead of appending right there, instead, *return* that from the .map callback, then .append the return of that .map
[16:47:33] <dougx1> the .map will return all of the elements in one "array"
[16:47:38] <dougx1> then append will do one efficient append
[16:47:44] <taplar> dougx1: i'm trying to get him to work though his logic
[16:47:44] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:47:48] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:48:04] <hellyeah> okey
[16:48:05] <dougx1> ok, just making sure he's got the point of view in sync and stuff :D
[16:48:08] <hellyeah> map return smt
[16:48:24] <hellyeah> map has capacity to return something
[16:48:28] <taplar> it must
[16:48:29] <hollusion> what would be a good way to find and replace every captial letter with its previous letter?
[16:48:36] <taplar> that's the whole purpose of map
[16:48:40] <taplar> otherwise you'd use each
[16:48:42] <hellyeah> yes
[16:48:52] <dougx1> hollusion: regex
[16:49:18] <hellyeah> but i have three different if
[16:49:22] <hollusion> dougx1, will regex return an array of all letters found in order?
[16:49:33] <hellyeah> so i have to add them under different if?
[16:49:34] <taplar> hellyeah: what do you mean?
[16:49:50] <hellyeah> i have three different conditions
[16:50:01] <taplar> there is no in on ln 75-77
[16:50:06] <taplar> in=if
[16:50:43] <dougx1> hollusion: 'aThis bTest'.replace(/(.)[A-Z]/g, '$1')
[16:50:54] <hellyeah> taplar:  i have in line 72
[16:51:13] <taplar> what does that have to do with the each?
[16:51:19] <dougx1> js> 'aThis bTest'.replace(/(.)[A-Z]/g, '$1')
[16:51:44] <hellyeah> well i have three objects
[16:51:50] <taplar> so?
[16:51:52] <hellyeah> capacitycenter1,2,3
[16:52:07] <hellyeah> i am iterating one of this depending on if
[16:52:11] <taplar> so?
[16:52:35] <hellyeah> and i added spesific json object to the second dropdown
[16:52:53] <hellyeah> is it false approach?
[16:52:54] <taplar> what does this have to do with converting the each to a map?
[16:53:17] <hellyeah> i dont know yet
[16:53:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:53:21] <hollusion> dougx1, "Ebm A G7".match(/[A-Z]/g, '$1')
[16:53:25] <hollusion> works like a charm, thank you
[16:53:26] <hellyeah> i guess i will figure it out :p
[16:53:29] <taplar> i never said combine them
[16:54:26] <hellyeah> combine if and map?
[16:54:30] <taplar> no!
[16:54:36] <taplar> read!!!
[16:54:40] <hellyeah> you never said i mean
[16:54:50] <hellyeah> you never said this
[16:55:19] <taplar> are you pulling another full day coding thing again?
[16:55:42] <hellyeah> this 12 a.m.
[16:55:49] <taplar> not an answer
[16:55:53] <hellyeah> i start coding at 8. a.m.
[16:55:59] <hellyeah> 16 hour
[16:56:02] <hellyeah> :p
[16:56:08] <robertmaxrees> !!!
[16:56:11] <taplar> how many breaks?
[16:56:12] <hellyeah> what do you mean "pulling"
[16:56:13] <robertmaxrees> that's terrible, dude
[16:56:27] <dougx1> programming your ass off is good in the long run though
[16:56:33] <robertmaxrees> not like that.
[16:56:37] <taplar> hell no
[16:56:39] <robertmaxrees> 16 hour days is terrible in the long run.
[16:56:40] <robertmaxrees> and the short run.
[16:56:49] <dougx1> assuming decent posture and ergonomics
[16:56:55] <robertmaxrees> uh
[16:56:57] <robertmaxrees> not even then.
[16:57:01] <hellyeah> i mean i have like 4 hours break
[16:57:02] <taplar> burnout is a fast way to ruin a career
[16:57:05] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:57:15] <robertmaxrees> i used to work regular 16s - never again.
[16:57:17] <dougx1> it isnt burnout when it is fun and you are motivated though
[16:57:21] <dougx1> even if it has been too many hours
[16:57:22] <hellyeah> actually i wouldnt come here
[16:57:32] <hellyeah> but i almost finished my code
[16:57:38] <robertmaxrees> dougx1 right, which is where you get much faster.
[16:57:40] <taplar> you keep saying that, :)
[16:57:42] <hellyeah> and taplar  did teach me very well
[16:57:56] <hellyeah> and he is here around that hour so
[16:58:09] <dougx1> lol
[16:58:16] <robertmaxrees> burnout is a very real and serious thing.
[16:58:26] <hellyeah> what does burnout mean?
[16:58:34] <hellyeah> like wasting yourself?
[16:58:48] <dougx1> it means, doing so much work that you are too mentally tired to do it properly
[16:59:00] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you're basically tiring yourself out really fast - you're going to hit a "wall".  you'll be physically and mentally unable to really do much.
[16:59:03] <robertmaxrees> including work.
[16:59:04] <arc_> or that you're sick of your work
[16:59:05] <hellyeah> yes
[16:59:15] <hellyeah> sometimes i felt really bored
[16:59:22] <robertmaxrees> i've seen it destroy people's lives before.
[16:59:41] <hellyeah> hit the wall or hit the roof
[16:59:44] <dougx1> it can be caused by bad emotions like working on something you hate, like wordpress or php :D
[16:59:47] <robertmaxrees> the wall.
[16:59:53] <hellyeah> hit the wall and hit the roof are similar
[16:59:56] <robertmaxrees> dougx1 it can be cause dby working too much, period.
[17:00:12] <hellyeah> dby?
[17:00:13] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah the wall is metaphorical in this case - as in you'll have a harder time solving problems.
[17:00:17] <robertmaxrees> *by
[17:00:26] <hellyeah> yes
[17:00:35] <hellyeah> it is really hard to understand stuff
[17:00:40] <hellyeah> right now
[17:00:42] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:00:46] <robertmaxrees> becuase you're burning out.
[17:00:54] <hellyeah> i am on the way everyday like 3-4 hours
[17:01:10] <hellyeah> and bad thing is
[17:01:17] <hellyeah> no one is helping me at office
[17:01:25] <hellyeah> i am the only one who try to do stuff
[17:01:27] <hellyeah> that sucks
[17:01:34] <robertmaxrees> so why are you pushing yourself so hard?
[17:01:40] <robertmaxrees> you're hurting yourself in the long run.
[17:01:41] <hellyeah> frontend is all on my shoulder
[17:01:54] <dougx1> hellyeah: is it fun though?
[17:01:56] <hellyeah> i will get promotion soon
[17:02:05] <robertmaxrees> they'll expect the same out of youy.
[17:02:13] <hellyeah> dougx1:  being only brain can be fun
[17:02:14] <robertmaxrees> you're basically putting yourself into a really bad spiral.
[17:02:21] <hellyeah> i need brainstorming sometimes
[17:02:45] <hellyeah> yea you are right
[17:03:05] <hellyeah> okey i will keep those in my mind
[17:03:07] <robertmaxrees> like, i was there.  i was working 16 hours a day for 5 days a week at one point - thought i'd be fine.  i wasn't.
[17:03:31] <hellyeah> mental thing must be the worst thing
[17:03:39] <taplar> even if i'm engrossed in what i'm doing, i'll mentally crash after a while
[17:03:46] <robertmaxrees> there's a physical part, too.
[17:03:48] <robertmaxrees> trust me.
[17:04:02] <hellyeah> yea
[17:04:07] <hellyeah> at least i am fitness guy
[17:04:17] <hellyeah> i am doing sports everyday
[17:04:32] <hellyeah> at job
[17:04:40] <dougx1> everything past 7 hours is "tired programming", you are more likely to make stupid typos
[17:04:44] <robertmaxrees> heh, i'd try to find stuff to do every day at NOT your jonb.
[17:04:49] <robertmaxrees> *job
[17:04:52] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:05:14] <taplar> unless you work at like a rec center
[17:05:18] <hellyeah> my work place is in the hell figuratively
[17:05:34] <hellyeah> we have a place for making sport
[17:05:43] <hellyeah> heavy lifter, cardio etc.
[17:05:58] <hellyeah> but you are right
[17:06:04] <hellyeah> i am pushing myself so hard
[17:06:08] <taplar> wish we had that, though i'd hate to get sweaty at work
[17:06:26] <hellyeah> taplar:  take a shower after fitness
[17:06:35] <hellyeah> i do this everyday
[17:06:41] <taplar> nah, not for me, :D
[17:06:58] <hellyeah> hmm
[17:07:10] <hellyeah> coding is fun
[17:07:28] <hellyeah> but you need to get away your stress somehow
[17:07:36] <robertmaxrees> it's not just stress.
[17:07:46] <hellyeah> hmm
[17:07:49] <hellyeah> what else?
[17:07:50] <taplar> i'd advise possibly some meditation
[17:08:01] <hellyeah> taplar:  at work?
[17:08:04] <taplar> sure
[17:08:09] <hellyeah> my meditation is music
[17:08:18] <hellyeah> i am listening music whole day
[17:08:22] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah it's that your brain and body want to do different things after a while.  you're not designed to sit in front of a computer, and doing so for excessive stretches is a bad idea.
[17:08:27] <robertmaxrees> you need to do something else.
[17:08:42] <hellyeah> like walking?
[17:08:48] <taplar> we got some people here who walk
[17:08:51] <robertmaxrees> you need to let your brain do something else.  this is true of pretty much any profession.
[17:08:54] <hellyeah> i plan to play bilard
[17:08:59] <taplar> they'll go out around lunch and walk around the campus
[17:09:19] <hellyeah> what about smoking cigarettes?
[17:09:31] <taplar> i'll never advise that, :P
[17:09:32] <hellyeah> thats bad idea i guess
[17:09:35] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you need to do different things for an extended period of time.
[17:09:39] <taplar> but to each his own
[17:09:48] <hellyeah> different thing each time
[17:09:49] <robertmaxrees> i'm not talking short breaks - i mean substantial activities.
[17:09:51] <hellyeah> ?
[17:09:54] <robertmaxrees> like hobbies.
[17:10:07] <hellyeah> i can play billard
[17:10:13] <robertmaxrees> stuff that gets you away for a while and not thinking about work.
[17:10:31] <hellyeah> billiards*
[17:11:15] <hellyeah> understand
[17:11:31] <robertmaxrees> you'll learn faster and be far more productive.
[17:11:40] <hellyeah> but that really sucks people at work full of js development from me
[17:12:02] <hellyeah> my collegue is full of backend guy
[17:12:11] <hellyeah> come one man i write backend to
[17:12:16] <hellyeah> give your hand to me
[17:12:21] <hellyeah> right?
[17:12:23] <taplar> consider how much time you spend re examining your code
[17:12:48] <taplar> a programmer is not always typing
[17:12:58] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[17:13:39] <hellyeah> well i am not like before
[17:13:44] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know how I can get jQuery v2.0.2 via npm?
[17:13:56] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy why would you want 2.0.2?
[17:13:56] <hellyeah> i try to shorten that times
[17:13:57] <cannap> import $ from 'jquery'
[17:13:58] <cannap> ^^
[17:14:09] <cannap> and set them global
[17:14:16] <hellyeah> taplar:  everyday i am developing my writing skills
[17:14:19] <cannap> and jquery is not modular i tested
[17:14:23] <hellyeah> thats not easy process for me
[17:14:26] <taplar> hellyeah: that's not my point
[17:14:29] <cannap> you get the whole source included
[17:14:29] <robertmaxrees> cannap huh?>
[17:14:38] <cannap> hi
[17:14:45] <taplar> my point is a big part of being a programmer is figuring out the problem, not typing
[17:14:53] <cannap> jquery you cant say import ajax from 'jquery'
[17:14:57] <hellyeah> i think about algorithm but there is more than that i have to thing 5 things at a time
[17:15:11] <hellyeah> taplar:  understand
[17:15:12] <cannap> you need to make import jquery from 'jquery';
[17:15:19] <cannap> and then say $ = jquery
[17:15:22] <cannap> or something
[17:15:24] <taplar> and the more mentally tired you are, the harder it is to do that
[17:15:28] <robertmaxrees> cannap let #jquery-dev know you want that.
[17:15:38] <dougx1> taplar: nice optimization trick, using map instead of individually appending
[17:15:40] <robertmaxrees> or put in a feature request.
[17:15:45] <dougx1> is that documented?
[17:15:54] <taplar> dougx1: use it, love it, :)
[17:16:06] <taplar> i'm sure it is some where
[17:16:13] <robertmaxrees> cannap also: http://requirejs.org/docs/jquery.html#modulename
[17:16:24] <taplar> in general the less amount of times you change the dom the better
[17:16:26] <hellyeah> you dont need to use append
[17:16:31] <hellyeah> when you use map?
[17:16:36] <taplar> yes you do
[17:16:39] <dougx1> you do
[17:16:42] <dougx1> once though
[17:16:45] <dougx1> instead of N calls
[17:16:54] <robertmaxrees> but you do it once AFTER the map, instead of once for each item in the array.
[17:17:04] <dougx1> then jquery can optimize it into one big change of the dom, so it never recomputes in between
[17:17:09] <cannap> yea i just include the whole
[17:17:13] <dougx1> reflows*
[17:17:15] <cannap> sometimes i think i only need one thing from jquery
[17:17:20] <robertmaxrees> actually, jquery isn't optimizing anything in that case :)
[17:17:23] <cannap> but then i make and make and need more and more^^
[17:17:38] <robertmaxrees> cannap then make a feature request.
[17:17:45] <robertmaxrees> that's a large organizational change, but maybe they'll do it.
[17:17:53] <hellyeah> cant you give me the solution :D
[17:17:57] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah no.
[17:17:57] <taplar> no
[17:18:01] <robertmaxrees> you know we don't do that.
[17:18:02] <hellyeah> okey
[17:18:03] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:18:11] <dougx1> D:
[17:18:12] <hellyeah> i tried my chance
[17:18:18] <hellyeah> :p
[17:18:39] <hellyeah> but you have three different objectds
[17:18:42] <hellyeah> and three if
[17:18:49] <taplar> again, why does that matter?
[17:18:56] <taplar> i don't know why you keep returning to that
[17:19:15] <taplar> oh, right, i was going to stop helping
[17:19:30] <hellyeah> anyway,
[17:19:35] <hellyeah> i am going to sleep
[17:19:42] <taplar> :)
[17:19:50] <hellyeah> before sleeping pls allow me ask one more question
[17:20:05] <hellyeah> can i unite those three object into one big object
[17:20:07] <hellyeah> ?
[17:20:09] <dougx1> the dom apis should include concepts learned in graphics apis: the ability to deliver a block of the same things in one step
[17:20:10] <taplar> maybe
[17:20:18] <taplar> but don't make that your step 1
[17:20:34] <hellyeah> so i dont need if
[17:20:51] <taplar> change them to use map first
[17:20:54] <taplar> then see where your at
[17:21:28] <cannap> robertmaxrees yea i look
[17:21:29] <hellyeah> aha
[17:21:34] <hellyeah> i have an idea
[17:21:34] <cannap> but i think they know this
[17:21:46] <hellyeah> i will look at tomorrow
[17:21:48] <hellyeah> night
[17:27:39] <skinux> I have DIVS containing FORMs, I need the best way to select a specific DIV to not only remove it from DOM, but also be able to send data to server to remove that DIVs info from DB.
[17:28:01] <robertmaxrees> depends.,
[17:28:05] <robertmaxrees> when are you removing/sending data?
[17:28:44] <dougx1> skinux: if each div has its own form, then in the forms submit, use .closest to find the closest div that encloses it
[17:28:56] <robertmaxrees> ^ that's where i was going with that.
[17:29:04] <robertmaxrees> was curious to know more about your particular case, but 'kay ;)
[17:29:09] <dougx1> closest is awesome
[17:29:12] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:29:19] <robertmaxrees> (fwiw i wanted to see their thought process)
[17:29:26] <skinux> Hmm.
[17:29:58] <robertmaxrees> sup?
[17:32:37] <dougx1> skinux: if you arent relying on the normal form submit, you might want to use .closest right away, then .find from there to get that div's form elements and build up an ajax submit from that
[17:32:57] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:33:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:33:04] <robertmaxrees> slow down duder.
[17:33:16] <dougx1> what?
[17:33:20] <dougx1> a 1 shot on one click?
[17:33:23] <dougx1> where's the loop?
[17:33:34] <robertmaxrees> he hasn't even explained what his actual use case is.
[17:33:35] <dougx1> performance of find for a submit?
[17:33:45] <robertmaxrees> just don't want to confuse him.
[17:33:45] <dougx1> k
[17:34:00] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:34:45] <dougx1> how do you .find including self?
[17:34:52] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:35:11] <dougx1> I have a case where I have a selector, which might be a descendent...
[17:35:17] <dougx1> but the element itself might match
[17:35:28] <robertmaxrees> in that case, you don'/.
[17:35:31] <taplar> you should shift to the parent
[17:35:32] <robertmaxrees> *don't
[17:35:36] <taplar> could
[17:35:42] <robertmaxrees> .find() only looks at descendents.
[17:35:45] <robertmaxrees> not the current element.
[17:36:28] <dougx1> I do, r=element.find(selector); if (element.is(selector)) return r.add(selector);
[17:36:46] <dougx1> nothing shorthandier than that?
[17:36:53] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:37:09] <dougx1> thought not, just checking :D. thanks
[17:37:19] <dougx1> oops, r.add(element)
[17:37:21] <dougx1> not selector
[17:37:31] <robertmaxrees> is this for a handler?
[17:38:17] <dougx1> taplar: ya sometimes you can, but in this case that parent has lots of the element we shifted up from
[17:38:38] <taplar> yeah, i thought about that after i said it
[17:38:56] <taplar> but for a moment, i was proud
[17:39:09] <dougx1> :D
[17:39:35] <dougx1> mental test cases flying by, pass pass pass... but tests not done yet :D
[17:39:40] <robertmaxrees> uh./
[17:39:45] <robertmaxrees> so is this for an event handler ooor..? :)
[17:40:32] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[17:41:25] <taplar> woah
[17:45:35] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:53:13] <dougx1> oh you meant me? I am "applying" properties so something in a drawing program. there is a helper that can set attribute of something in the object by selector. sometimes that selector needed to refer to the top level element
[17:53:58] <dougx1> to* something
[17:54:48] <dougx1> i.e. top.find(selector) ( + top if top.is(selector) )
[17:55:17] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees Sorry, got busy. And because it's what we're already using in this project.

[19:25:58] <boaz> daeiou
[19:37:46] <redlizard> Greetings.
[19:38:04] <redlizard> I have a submit() handler for a form, and inside that handler I want to click() one of that form's submit buttons.
[19:38:39] <redlizard> That submit button does not have any javascript event handlers on it, in particularly no click handlers.
[19:38:53] <redlizard> But when I do this, the form does not submit, and neither is my handler triggered.
[19:38:53] <robertmaxrees> why do you want to click it?
[19:39:21] <redlizard> robertmaxrees: Because there may or may not be event handlers on that click event.
[19:39:27] <redlizard> For my tests, I know there are none.
[19:39:35] <redlizard> But in the eventual code, there may be.
[19:39:50] <robertmaxrees> let me rephrase then - why not just call the logic you care about directly?
[19:40:00] <redlizard> Because I don't know what logic may or may not apply.
[19:40:15] <redlizard> That's a completely unrelated piece of code that may or may not even be active.
[19:40:19] <robertmaxrees> that's going to be hard to work with, but OK.
[19:41:17] <redlizard> The practical problem I'm trying to solve is making form submits from non-submit buttons effectively trigger a specific submit button.
[19:42:00] <redlizard> That is, I have a form with multiple submit buttons, and each input logically belongs to a particular submit button; if the user presses enter from within those inputs, I want it to behave like a click on the corresponding submit button.
[19:42:14] <redlizard> Both if further event handlers apply to that button, and if they do not.
[19:42:15] <robertmaxrees> oh, any reason youc an't just make them all separate forms?
[19:42:23] <redlizard> Yes, they share input fields.
[19:42:49] <redlizard> It's structured with a set of items in a table, each with a checkbox, and multiple operations you can perform on the set of checked objects.
[19:43:50] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to play with it - it sounds like you have submit handlers canceling the submit event from those buttons.
[19:43:52] <redlizard> So what I have (pseudocode) is form.submit(function(){ if (document.activeElement == input1) submit1.click(); })
[19:43:57] <robertmaxrees> is this all ajax or normal form submits?
[19:44:03] <redlizard> Yes, that's what it sounds like for me as well.
[19:44:09] <redlizard> For now, it's normal form submits.
[19:44:17] <robertmaxrees> do you plan on making it ajax though?
[19:44:30] <redlizard> Ajax handling is one of the things that may or may not happen as an event handler on the submit button,
[19:44:32] <redlizard> .
[19:44:41] <redlizard> And things should work either with or without it.
[19:44:51] <robertmaxrees> heh, okay.
[19:44:55] <robertmaxrees> good luck then :X
[19:44:57] <redlizard> Of course, I do not want to tie the enter-key-handling to the ajax handling.
[19:45:16] <redlizard> For all the obvious reasons as to why that's a bad idea.
[19:45:25] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:45:28] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[19:45:45] <redlizard> Like the two chunks of functionality are logically distinct and should therefore be decoupled in the code.
[19:46:23] <robertmaxrees> err, i feel like you're overly complicating things.  if you have JS available, then you also have ajax available, so I don't see any big inherent risk in making this easier on yourself.
[19:46:53] <robertmaxrees> so all my feedback is going to be rather nonproductive :)
[19:47:14] <redlizard> Availability has nothing to do with it. The ajax handling option is not always desirable.
[19:47:27] <robertmaxrees> okay.  good luck :)
[19:49:45] <redlizard> So what I expect is happening here is jquery trying to avoid infinite recursion in event handling.
[19:49:53] <redlizard> Either that, or it's the browser that's doing the same.
[19:50:01] <robertmaxrees> your console will tell you.
[19:50:13] <redlizard> How?
[19:50:22] <robertmaxrees> open it.  do the event.  do you see an error about recursion?
[19:50:26] <redlizard> No.
[19:50:39] <robertmaxrees> are you canceling the event in your submit handler?
[19:50:40] <redlizard> But that doesn't mean anything.
[19:50:54] <redlizard> The original submit event? Yes.
[19:50:57] <robertmaxrees> sure it does - browsers will tell you when there's too much recursion.
[19:50:59] <robertmaxrees> and that's why.
[19:51:05] <robertmaxrees> you're canceling the event and then triggering it again.
[19:51:20] <redlizard> A second submit event is never triggered in the first place.
[19:51:28] <robertmaxrees> you're clicking the button, right?
[19:51:35] <robertmaxrees> or simulating one at least.
[19:51:42] <redlizard> Yes.
[19:51:47] <robertmaxrees> that triggers another submit event.
[19:51:53] <redlizard> It should.
[19:51:56] <robertmaxrees> that then gets caught by your submit handler.
[19:51:56] <redlizard> But it isn't doing that.
[19:52:11] <robertmaxrees> then i dunno.  i'd have to see your code.
[19:52:32] <redlizard> I can make a minimized example. Sec.
[19:52:47] <robertmaxrees> because i can only assume that you've, for instance, set a breakpoint in your submit handler to verify it's actually getting called in the first place.
[19:53:00] <redlizard> console.log, but yes.
[20:04:16] <redlizard> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/zqbpujs1/
[20:04:52] <robertmaxrees> so first off - $('input[name="input2"]').get(0) === document.activeElement
[20:04:55] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use this.
[20:05:00] <robertmaxrees> because equality in JS is a funky thing.
[20:05:06] <robertmaxrees> you want the jquery .is() operator.
[20:05:16] <redlizard> Noted.
[20:05:46] <redlizard> But unnecessary-problem-avoiding aside, this SHOULD be valid, right? I'm comparing DOM objects with DOM objects.
[20:05:58] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to work the way you think it is.
[20:06:07] <robertmaxrees> also, iirc document.activeElement won't be the element that you trigger click on.
[20:06:09] <redlizard> (Keeping in mind that we all know the relationship between "should be valid" and "works in practice".)
[20:06:19] <redlizard> Yes, that's the intent.
[20:06:20] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[20:06:24] <robertmaxrees> those are one in the same here.
[20:06:45] <redlizard> Yes, that's what I mean. Continue.
[20:06:48] <robertmaxrees> because {} === {}; is false.
[20:07:13] <redlizard> So anyway, besides the .is() thing...
[20:07:19] <robertmaxrees> that's important for later.
[20:07:23] <robertmaxrees> so how do i replicate your bug?
[20:07:37] <redlizard> Type something in the second text edit. Press enter.
[20:07:45] <redlizard> What SHOULD happen is that the form gets submitted to google.
[20:07:59] <redlizard> Well, actually
[20:08:10] <robertmaxrees> which doesn't happen here because of a mixed content error.
[20:08:13] <redlizard> With that inHandler business commented out, what should happen is an infinite recursion, I guess.
[20:08:54] <redlizard> But if you reactivate everything I commented out for now, what should happen is a submit to google. Up to the https.
[20:10:57] <robertmaxrees> i see the submit happen.
[20:11:51] <redlizard> This is strange.
[20:12:00] <redlizard> It seems to be working on the fiddle.
[20:12:07] <redlizard> Or mostly working, anyway.
[20:12:16] <redlizard> But it's NOT working on my local html file.
[20:12:18] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zqbpujs1/2/ this seems to be fine.
[20:12:25] <robertmaxrees> so that first console log doesn't fire?
[20:14:12] <redlizard> On your fiddle I don't see any console logs, just a blocked content error. Hm.
[20:14:15] <redlizard> That makes no sense.
[20:14:37] <robertmaxrees> what browser are you in?
[20:14:40] <redlizard> Firefox.
[20:15:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i type in the second input, hit enter, get the logs.
[20:15:16] <robertmaxrees> you sure you're not filtering them out?
[20:15:46] <redlizard> It's firebug, I'm never sure what it is and isn't doing...
[20:15:59] <robertmaxrees> the built-in tools are pretty solid these days.
[20:16:11] <robertmaxrees> so much so that firebug is actually going to stop being its own plugin.
[20:16:30] <robertmaxrees> rather, it'll be a plugin to the new dev tools.
[20:17:06] <redlizard> But I'm still having the weird issue that my local html file, which I copied piecewise into the fiddle, seems to do something *different* than the fiddle.
[20:17:27] <redlizard> Try http://pastebin.com/PfUGgY2Z as a local html file.
[20:17:34] <robertmaxrees> "local html file" - are you doing this through a server or just opening an html file from your hard drive?
[20:17:45] <redlizard> The latter.
[20:17:51] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:18:01] <robertmaxrees> there's your issue.
[20:18:07] <FlashSlayer> Hey. Tell me one thing about jQuery. If I use $('#id').click(handler), and then function handler(e) {} will "e" always contain the event?
[20:18:16] <robertmaxrees> FlashSlayer yep.
[20:18:19] <FlashSlayer> In old IE versions it was "event" variable
[20:18:25] <robertmaxrees> FlashSlayer you can call it "event".
[20:18:27] <robertmaxrees> or whatever you want.
[20:18:31] <robertmaxrees> it'll always be the event object.
[20:18:50] <FlashSlayer> robertmaxrees: in old IE versions it was a local vriable, not argument
[20:19:02] <FlashSlayer> robertmaxrees: so my question is about old IE support
[20:19:13] <robertmaxrees> use the name of the argument.
[20:19:15] <FlashSlayer> whether "e" is always "e||event" or do I need to do it manually
[20:19:28] <robertmaxrees> always pass the arg, and always use that.
[20:19:34] <robertmaxrees> jquery fills in and fixes those issues for you.
[20:19:38] <robertmaxrees> so it works accross all browsers.
[20:19:41] <FlashSlayer> well, great :)
[20:20:01] <FlashSlayer> and how about target = e.target || e.srcElement? Probably jQuery doesn't fix that
[20:20:41] <redlizard> FlashSlayer: I think it does fix that.
[20:20:55] <FlashSlayer> so srcElement or target is proper? I always forget that.
[20:21:01] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[20:21:07] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing that in the first palce?
[20:21:08] <robertmaxrees> *place
[20:21:25] <redlizard> robertmaxrees: So how is the local file a problem? Throwing it on a webserver doesn't change anything.
[20:21:26] <robertmaxrees> e.target is what you want.
[20:21:29] <FlashSlayer> I'm implementing some kind of drag'n'drop mechanism
[20:21:49] <robertmaxrees> redlizard your browser trying to protect you from executing random potentially unsafe js locally.
[20:22:07] <robertmaxrees> also, you're missing a doctype.
[20:23:09] <redlizard> In any case, neither the webserver nor the doctype changes anything.
[20:23:13] <redlizard> Does this file work for you?
[20:23:31] <robertmaxrees> i'm in the middle of some things, but are you actually tryiong to use google as your submit target?
[20:24:00] <redlizard> No, that's just there as an example in the minimized version of the problem.
[20:24:22] <robertmaxrees> okay, then i dunno - it works in jsfiddle sooo.
[20:24:35] <redlizard> Yes, that is puzzling.
[20:26:28] <redlizard> Maybe I should try stepping through the code and seeing what jquery does with it.
[20:28:11] <robertmaxrees> i thought you said it wasn't even hitting the handler...
[20:28:30] <redlizard> It's hitting the handler once. Not a second time.
[20:28:46] <robertmaxrees> right, so debugging it won't tell you anything.
[20:28:57] <redlizard> I can step through the click() call.
[20:30:09] <redlizard> And see how it manages NOT to hit the handler again.
[20:30:33] <robertmaxrees> you aren't like adding and removing that element or anything like that, right?
[20:30:41] <redlizard> Nope.
[20:31:23] <robertmaxrees> no clue then.
[20:44:51] <redlizard> robertmaxrees: I'm getting the strong impression that this is just firefox doing something strange.
[20:45:09] <robertmaxrees> i doubt it, but OK.
[20:50:38] <redlizard> Well, it does seem to work on internet explorer.
[20:51:32] <redlizard> So that's pretty suggestive.
[20:51:42] <robertmaxrees> then why does it magically work for me on FF?
[20:51:52] <redlizard> Does it? The version without the fiddle?
[20:52:31] <redlizard> I have no idea how the fiddle is involved here, but it does seem to have an influence somehow.
[20:53:12] <robertmaxrees> the fiddle itself i mean.
[20:53:30] <robertmaxrees> like, i wonder if you're filtering things in your firebug console or have some caching working against you.
[20:54:41] <redlizard> The same page that works on internet explorer, does NOT work on firefox on that same windows machine. Which is a perfectly plain firefox without any dev tools installed and on which I did not do any testing before this.
[20:54:49] <redlizard> So no.
[21:21:19] <dibs> Could any kind soul inform me of why this isn't working when trying to count tables in a doc http://pastebin.com/FGBThrPC
[21:33:25] <Poppabear> dibs: maybe your selector isn't correct ?
[21:33:48] <Poppabear> $(table) or $('.table') or $('#table') ....
[21:34:19] <Poppabear> depends if you are checking the element itself, the elements class, the elements id ... ect ?
[21:36:06] <dibs> Poppabear, I'm looking for <table>s so should I drop the quotes?
[21:39:18] <dibs> I'm wondering if it's due to too many elements in the DOM
[21:40:24] <Poppabear> not sure, but if you want the table elements themselves then what you have 'should' work
[22:11:58] <dibs> Poppabear, yeah, I have just over a thousand tables in a report so I am guessing it's just too big, works in codepen. Cheers
[22:22:45] <lianzinho> hello guys, are there a way to substitutue an element HTML but always letting the first-child ?
[23:04:06] <hellyeah> hey
[23:04:10] <hellyeah> anyone here
[23:30:44] <dougx1> hi
[23:31:19] <dougx1> lianzinho: what do you mean by "always letting"
[23:32:18] <lianzinho> I need to update a <select> with <option>, but I would like to let the first one still, because it’s the placeholder
[23:32:53] <dougx1> you mean remove all but the first? someSelector.slice(1).remove()
[23:33:08] <dougx1> slice(1) means, all starting at index 1
[23:33:11] <dougx1> omits 0
[23:33:38] <dougx1> probably someSelect.children('option').slice(1).remove()
[23:34:03] <lianzinho> oh, nice, so I would need to remove and then append
[23:34:13] <lianzinho> instead of just adding with .html()
[23:34:21] <dougx1> avoid .html
[23:35:08] <dougx1> what are you doing to the options?
[23:35:16] <dougx1> there might be a more efficient way to do what you are doing
[23:36:36] <dougx1> dont build up a string of html, that is the worst way. asking for a security hole, fragile, won't handle arbitrary data
[23:38:48] <dougx1> someSelect.append(optionInputs.map(function(optionData) { return $('<option/>', { value: optionData.id, text: optionData.description }); })
[23:40:41] <dougx1> jquery will efficiently and securely create the elements as objects and set attributes/call text method and put them all as children of select
[23:40:47] <dougx1> no html involved
[23:46:25] <lianzinho> dougx1: i’m creating a new Option() and apending
[23:46:44] <lianzinho> in fact I’m using underscore to create all the iterations
[23:48:09] <Mark____> does anyone know a way to auto adjust the iframe height to fit to the height of the contents inside the iframe?
[23:48:32] <dougx1> ok then in there I suggest creating the option elements with $('<option/>', { value: something, text: something })
[23:48:37] <dougx1> and append those
[23:48:43] <dougx1> it will be secure then
[23:49:35] <dougx1> internally it will document.createElement('option') and set the value attribute and call the jquery .text method on it to append a textnode
[23:51:06] <dougx1> Mark____: and you control code on both sides / or are same domain inside and outside iframe?
[23:51:31] <Mark____> all sounds very complex
[23:51:59] <dougx1> Mark____: is the page with the iframe and the iframe content in the same domain?
[23:52:12] <Mark____> yes it’s the same domain, so it’s not cross domain.
[23:52:25] <dougx1> ok then yes you can "reach into" an iframe
[23:52:36] <Mark____> i’ve tried all the available options that are in the SO
[23:52:43] <Mark____> take a look at this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35714160/iframe-auto-adjusting-its-height-to-fit-to-the-content-height?noredirect=1#comment59105161_35714160
[23:52:50] <Mark____> this is me.
[23:53:04] <dougx1> SO isnt super-authoritative for js stuff imho...
[23:53:34] <Mark____> so could you please help me out?
[23:53:48] <Mark____> this is important, but taking way too much of my time.
[23:53:59] <Mark____> *fair warning, i do not know how to type fast*
[23:54:29] <lianzinho> dougx1: what is insecure in using new Option ?
[23:54:33] <lianzinho> browse compatibility ?
[23:54:50] <dougx1> building a string of html with += is not secure
[23:55:02] <dougx1> that is what I said
[23:55:09] <dougx1> or meant to convey
[23:55:49] <dougx1> it is much faster and much more natural to create DOM objects and manipulate them as objects
[23:56:03] <dougx1> and even if it weren't faster it is much more secure
[23:57:07] <dougx1> Mark____: you want to get the height of the iframe content and set the size of the iframe to the correct size, right?
[23:57:20] <Mark____> yes.
[23:57:30] <Mark____> so that there is no scroll bar
[23:57:31] <Mark____> in the iframe.
[23:57:48] <Mark____> instead, the scroll bar should be there in the parent doc.
