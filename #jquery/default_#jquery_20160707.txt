[00:05:33] <Mapper99> >>_August_ - solved the issue by:  $.each(json, function(index, element) { 				console.log(element.building); 				});
[00:10:38] <soee> how can i get element width without paddings ?
[00:44:25] <topohomy> Do I have to have two different PHP files for processing $.ajax POST requests?
[00:46:49] <Velveeta> i'm not quite sure i follow that question, but i'm pretty sure the answer is no..
[00:47:01] <topohomy> Or I can only have one file in which both does $.ajax POST request and processes the request sent?
[00:47:22] <Velveeta> can you give an example of the 2 types of post requests you're trying to make?
[00:49:17] <topohomy> Velveeta: Consider index.php page in which has draggable forms for setting up some options like activating sidebar. When I drag some sidebar from left column to the right column the sidebar would be activated. I want to save these draggable forms state after I have committed the drag and drop operation. Do I have to have another PHP file in which process and saves their positions in the database?
[00:50:20] <Velveeta> so you're wanting to know if you can both render something within a php file, and process a post that the rendered form might submit, within the same file?
[00:50:50] <topohomy> Another example would be a simple form. I want to save the message sent from a user to me. I want to use ajax POST. The form code is in index.php file. Can I send the ajax request to the same index.php and include the PHP code required for processing and saving the message in database in the same file?
[00:51:30] <Velveeta> so, a) that question's a little out of the scope of what this channel is for, you might have better luck asking something like that in #php in the future, but b) yes, that's entirely possible to do
[00:51:31] <topohomy> Velveeta: Yeah
[00:52:28] <topohomy> Velveeta: Do you know any good resource for learning how to integrate Jquery and PHP to get have better looking design?
[00:52:57] <topohomy> Velveeta: I know some PHP stuff but when it comes to its integration with jQuery and JavaScript I am lost.
[00:53:06] <Velveeta> i think you're asking the wrong kind of question there... neither jquery nor php have anything to do with the design quality
[00:53:35] <Velveeta> let me dig you up some tutorial links about working with both php and js
[00:53:50] <topohomy> Velveeta: I will appreciate your help.
[00:54:18] <Velveeta> however, my short answer will be don't combine the 2... server-side-generated javascript isn't easy to maintain, and it's difficult to track down the source of an issue when they inevitably pop up
[00:54:41] <Velveeta> store all of your js in external .js files, and simply include them in your php pages with <script> tags
[00:56:43] <topohomy> Velveeta: I don't want to echo out javascript code via PHP. I just want to have PHP form processing code and js code needed for sending post request(without reloading the page) in the same file.
[00:57:11] <Velveeta> if you want them in the same file, then you would have to echo out javascript code
[00:57:59] <Velveeta> your original question (i thought) was can you render a page with php that will have a form, which you want to post back to the same php script that rendered it, to process the post
[00:58:43] <Velveeta> none of that involves javascript whatsoever... if you want to use jquery to post that form, you have 2 options: 1) put just the javascript portion in its own file, and include that file in your php page's output via a <script> tag
[00:59:01] <Velveeta> or 2) echo out javascript within a <script> block in the rendered php page, which i wouldn't advise
[00:59:30] <Velveeta> in either case, the php that renders the page, and the php that processes the post, can live within the same file, whether the javascript that actually posts the form lives there or not
[01:00:58] <topohomy> Velveeta: Why's that? I simply put a conditional block for checking whether the form has been submitted or not. If yes, I would process the form data, if the answer is no I won't. Is it really necessary to echo out the js inclusion code via php rather than simple hard coding the <script> tag ?
[01:01:22] <topohomy> *simply
[01:02:22] <Velveeta> well, when i say "echo out the javascript from php" i'm talking about within the scope of a php script, whether you're using the echo statement like: echo '<script>alert("foo!");</script>' or whether you're using php tags like: ?> <script>alert('foo!'); <?php
[01:02:34] <Velveeta> in either case, you're echoing out javascript from php
[01:03:11] <Velveeta> i'm saying that that should be avoided entirely, and your javascript should all live within its own external file
[01:04:01] <Velveeta> and yes, as far as the conditional check to determine whether the form has been submitted or not, that part is correct, which is why it's fine to have the form rendered from php and processed from php in the same file
[01:04:17] <Velveeta> but the javascript that actually submits the form, i would personally stick into an external file
[01:04:25] <jak2000> Velveeta know about css?
[01:04:32] <topohomy> Velveeta: So I can simple put the js in for instance myJs.js then include it in my index.php via <script src="path/myJs.js"></script>
[01:04:35] <Velveeta> and again, this is all out of the scope of this channel, this is the kind of thing you should be asking in #php
[01:04:51] <Velveeta> jak2000: i'd stick the css into its own file also
[01:05:00] <Velveeta> topohomy: correct
[01:05:21] <jak2000> accept a pm? pls
[01:05:26] <Velveeta> sure
[01:05:58] <topohomy> Velveeta: BTW, thanks for your explanations and time.
[01:06:05] <Velveeta> topohomy: no problemo
[01:09:39] <Velveeta> jak2000: did you have a question?
[01:46:09] <_August_> can someone take a quick look at a problem im having? I am trying to use a shorthand if statement for a because I want to display an empty property if my variable is undefined. The problem is that I keep getting an error about the obj displaying not being able to read the property. Any suggestions? the problem is on line 5 http://pastebin.com/C0RJY7bG
[02:03:51] <lowbro> someString.text(); cuts off everything after a newline (\n), that is weird
[02:05:37] <lowbro> no it doesn't my code is broken.
[02:08:40] <Cork> _August_: check what "data" is
[02:08:56] <Cork> _August_: also if this is for ajax, fix the server code so you don't have to hack around it
[02:09:13] <Cork> (also don't forget to define chart_data)
[02:09:48] <Cork> _August_: and thirdly .series != undefined, not 'undefined'
[02:38:36] <_August_> Cork, obj.series.data.series is undefined
[02:38:44] <_August_> it give the message as its uppose to
[02:38:56] <_August_> but i neen to do obj.series.data.series.data if it is define
[02:39:00] <_August_> which is the problem
[02:39:05] <Cork> so it is the string "undefined" not actually undefined?
[02:39:16] <_August_> because it gives a error back if its not defined and stops my shorthand from working
[02:39:26] <Cork> you missed my first point
[02:39:30] <Cork> check what obj is
[02:39:45] <Cork> i gave you three problems with that code
[02:39:52] <_August_> obj.series.data.series gives me the response of undefined
[02:40:04] <Cork> then 'undefined' won't work
[02:40:19] <Cork> you need undefined like i said in the third comment
[02:40:54] <_August_> ok
[02:41:00] <_August_> also
[02:41:04] <_August_> data gives me this error
[02:41:23] <_August_> monthly.js:102 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'data' of undefined
[02:41:33] <Cork> please check all the comments i gave you before
[02:41:38] <_August_> i did
[02:41:43] <_August_> i understand what you're saying
[02:41:44] <Cork> then you should have the answer
[02:41:50] <Cork> that is part of the FIRST comment
[02:42:18] <_August_> i am responding to the 1st comment
[02:42:31] <Cork> uh.. no undefined was the last comment...
[02:42:36] <Cork> >_<
[02:42:46] <_August_> yeah we talked about that 1st lol
[02:42:48] <Cork> make a jsfiddle with the content you're working with
[02:42:51] <Cork> this is getting silly
[02:42:56] <_August_> lol ojk
[02:42:58] <_August_> sorry man
[03:18:06] <Solarlux> Anyone knows good IDE which auto inserts function(){}   ?
[04:31:52] <_August_> Solarlux, webstorm
[04:32:03] <_August_> anything from jetbrains actually
[04:32:06] <_August_> sublime too
[04:32:18] <_August_> and visual code studio as well
[04:33:20] <Solarlux> thx
[05:22:36] <e-anima> hi
[05:24:03] <e-anima> i have multipleblocks after each other. i initially hide all but the first. if the first is clicked the second appears. if that is clicked the third does. my problem is like finding the NEXT element. this is how i display a block: $('#kaufberater-step section.facet-question').slideUp({ ....  the next one i tried with  $(this).closest('section.facet-question').next('.facet-question').fadeIn('slow');
[05:24:05] <e-anima> but that doesn twok
[05:25:51] <Cork> e-anima: .next looks as the next element
[05:25:58] <Cork> if that element matches the selector it returns it
[05:26:04] <Cork> _else it doesn't return anything_
[05:26:12] <Cork> you most likely want nextAll().first()
[05:26:20] <e-anima> yes but i try to do something wrapper independent. next only works if all the wrappers are the same. if you add one all breaks
[05:26:31] <Cork> else things like <p></p><br><p></p> wont work
[05:26:44] <Cork> .next('p') form the first p would return an empty collection
[05:26:46] <e-anima> ok so nextAll is the way i should look
[05:26:50] <Cork> yes
[05:26:55] <e-anima> thank you
[05:27:04] <Cork> don't forget .first() though
[05:27:10] <Cork> else you get all of the ones after it
[05:28:17] <codecutter> how can i format 24 hour time '14:30' to "2:30 PM"?
[05:28:38] <Cork> codecutter: i suggest using moment.js
[05:28:44] <Cork> cause there isn't a clean built in solution
[05:29:22] <codecutter> its seems like too much?
[05:30:15] <codecutter> a whole lib for only one thing?
[05:30:57] <Cork> the alternative is someting like (date.getHour() % 12) + ':' + date.getMinutes() + ' ' + (date.getHour() < 12 ? 'AM' : 'PM'))
[05:31:09] <Cork> cause ya, there is no time/date format function in js
[05:31:34] <codecutter> let me try that.
[05:31:51] <Cork> (also that is me just typing of the top of my head, also i don't use am/pm so...
[05:31:58] <Cork> take it for what it is :)
[05:32:40] <codecutter> actually moment.js seem specific to date only so I might go with that
[05:32:58] <Cork> moment is for time and date format and difference calculation
[05:33:07] <Cork> so it is fairly specific
[05:33:32] <codecutter> i assumes it had a bunch of other stuff i did not need :)
[05:33:33] <Cork> and ya, parting and formating date/time is a pain without it
[05:33:37] <codecutter> assumed*
[05:33:51] <Cork> parting==parsing
[05:34:45] <e-anima> i am not sure why this is not working.  $(this).closest('section.facet-question').nextAll('.facet-question').first().fadeIn('slow'); in my opinion it does the following, i clicked a block so $this is the clicked element. in then goes up the dom until it finds section.facet-question. then it searches for next macthes (in this case the next block) that has the class facet-question. it uses the first macth because there
[05:34:45] <e-anima> are multiple blocks. then it fades in that block
[05:35:06] <Cork> e-anima: make a jsfiddle with the js and the dom structure
[05:35:23] <Cork> it isn't really possible to decode dom structure from a fraction of js
[05:35:30] <e-anima> yea ok
[05:47:14] <e-anima> i am not sure if i use that fideel correctly
[05:47:20] <e-anima> https://jsfiddle.net/Lw6bmtqr/12/
[05:47:32] <e-anima> is jquery embedded now or not? i dont get any errors
[05:47:44] <e-anima> thats the first dependecy to run anything
[05:47:48] <Cork> click the "javascript" title
[05:47:58] <e-anima> th gear
[05:47:59] <Cork> you get a dropdown and the jquery version 1.8.3 is picked there
[05:48:06] <e-anima> yes i have done that
[05:48:28] <Cork> so ya, everything is correct as far as i can see (quick glance)
[05:49:03] <Cork> e-anima: you really need to use 1.8.3?
[05:49:05] <Cork> that's quite old
[05:49:53] <e-anima> i can use 1.10.1
[05:50:38] <e-anima> but currently i will chose the same as the system is running. otherwise it will go BOOM later
[05:50:45] <e-anima> i can test aroudn if it works
[05:50:56] <e-anima> but first it even has to
[05:51:01] <Cork> ya
[05:51:07] <Cork> anyway cleaning it up right now
[05:51:19] <e-anima> ok
[05:51:21] <Cork> btw why do you have a global lastquestion variable?
[05:51:32] <Cork> why do you need this info cross events?
[05:51:40] <e-anima> for saving if lastquestion is clicked
[05:51:52] <Cork> for what reason?
[05:52:10] <e-anima> i am not a master in js, so i dont know a better way
[05:52:11] <e-anima> :)
[05:52:17] <Cork> ya, but for what
[05:52:24] <Cork> i don't see anything needing a global
[05:52:50] <e-anima> you mean putting it inside my click handler is enough?
[05:52:55] <Cork> yes
[05:53:00] <Cork> and safer
[05:53:14] <e-anima> so i do var lastquestion = false; then it is always defined as false
[05:53:24] <Cork> just give me a min i'm rewriting the code
[05:53:33] <Cork> i will have to ask questions to get your intentions though
[05:53:41] <Cork> you state //hide last question block after click.
[05:53:45] <Cork> but then you run $('#kaufberater-step section.facet-question')
[05:53:53] <Cork> selecting all facet-question
[05:54:01] <Cork> what is the meant action?
[05:54:48] <e-anima> there are 3 blocks. all are hiden except the first. if you click the first it disappears and the second shows. if you click the second the third shows
[05:55:33] <e-anima> i have that running domdependend with next().next() bt that is so bad because its dom dependednt and a wrapper destoys all
[05:55:42] <e-anima> a wrapper added i mean
[06:01:56] <e-anima> i am eating now. will report back if i have that fiddle running. currently TypeError: jQuery.easing[this.easing] is not a function
[06:01:58] <e-anima> local works
[06:02:22] <codecutter> Cork: do I have to pass a date format in a particular format? sever returns data in this format (d/m/y) 7/7/2016 19:30 PM
[06:02:28] <codecutter> Cork: do I have to pass a date format in a particular format? sever returns data in this format (d/m/y) 7/7/2016 19:30
[06:02:30] <codecutter> no PM
[06:02:42] <codecutter> date object*
[06:03:00] <codecutter> moment.js
[06:04:25] <codecutter> nvm
[06:05:33] <Cork> e-anima: this should do what you want https://jsfiddle.net/Lw6bmtqr/15/
[06:05:49] <Cork> e-anima: the problem is easing is missing and i don't remember how you add that in 1.8
[06:07:56] <Cork> e-anima: https://jsfiddle.net/Lw6bmtqr/16/ easing disabled and a typo fix
[06:12:01] <Cork> codecutter: you have to first parse it into an object ya
[06:26:59] <codecutter> moment is not defined? moment('2016-08-20 14:29:00').format('MMM. d, YYYY');
[06:27:17] <Cork> make sure you've loaded the lib
[06:27:58] <codecutter> i may need shim
[06:28:08] <Cork> uh, why?
[06:30:09] <codecutter> becuase I'm working with requirejs
[06:30:33] <codecutter> moment depens on jquery, right? so I may need to load jquery first
[06:31:33] <codecutter> nvm
[06:31:36] <codecutter> got it
[06:31:44] <Cork> no
[06:31:48] <Cork> it doesn't
[06:31:57] <Cork> moment is a completely stand alone lib
[06:36:47] <Cork> codecutter: https://jsfiddle.net/ms5ht5aL/1/
[06:36:49] <e-anima> re. thx Cork. i check it out now
[06:36:55] <Cork> anyway gtg
[06:36:57] <codecutter> i got it
[06:37:00] <codecutter> but thx
[06:45:51] <codecutter> Cork: I need date/time to be twitter ( display the age relative to now) e.g. if  date time is '2016-07-07 14:29:00' then it would show '1 min ago'
[06:45:58] <codecutter> twitter like*
[06:46:19] <codecutter> does moment support this?
[06:51:28] <codecutter> got it
[06:54:09] <jak2000> hi Cork!
[06:54:27] <e-anima> Cork, thx. i see now that you do something i also did: wrapper.next().find('.facet-question').fadeIn('slow');
[06:54:29] <e-anima> that next()
[06:54:43] <e-anima> so if i would add another wrapper i would eed next().next()
[06:57:43] <e-anima> i will try if i get it
[06:59:57] <e-anima> example, no wrapper. https://jsfiddle.net/Lw6bmtqr/19/
[07:00:00] <e-anima> that wont work :(
[07:03:08] <e-anima> i think i got it
[07:03:09] <e-anima> https://jsfiddle.net/Lw6bmtqr/20/
[07:10:36] <e-anima> think i got the answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12873027/jquery-forget-the-dom-structure-just-find-the-next-element-with-this-class
[07:10:41] <e-anima> jquery can no tdo that by default
[07:23:29] <Cork> e-anima: no, the .next() is to find the next sibling
[07:23:38] <Cork> e-anima: .closest() is to find the parent
[07:24:07] <Cork> e-anima: also you want to search in dom hierarchy cause if you don't you lose a lot of performance
[07:24:17] <e-anima> ok
[07:25:32] <Cork> e-anima: also in /20/ you can replace nextAll('.facet-question').first() with just .next()
[07:25:50] <Cork> nextAll is when you need to support other element types inbetween
[07:26:01] <e-anima> ok thx
[07:46:54] <jquery041> HI
[08:36:50] <Diplomat> Hey guys, does anyone know a div sliding lib that doesn't mess with the width? Like, I'd like to slide a div from right to left, but I don't want it to go from width:0 to width: n.. it compresses the content and looks ugly af.
[08:39:28] <Cork> Diplomat: you could use css3 transition
[08:39:45] <Diplomat> Hmm.. good idea too
[08:48:58] <Cork> Diplomat: something like https://jsfiddle.net/gspbpz08/
[08:49:48] <Diplomat> Ooo this is pretty good, thanks, I was looking for something like this too
[08:50:02] <Cork> with some more animations https://jsfiddle.net/gspbpz08/1/
[08:50:17] <decx> transition only transform and opacity tho
[08:50:32] <decx> dat composite only performance
[08:50:43] <Cork> uh, what?
[08:50:59] <decx> well you know layout paint and stuff like that
[08:51:14] <decx> transform and opacity are only composite so you dont get reflows
[08:51:34] <Cork> ya
[08:51:49] <Cork> (had a bit of trouble connecting it to what we talked about :D )
[08:51:51] <decx> http://i.imgur.com/9WBQotl.jpg
[08:52:43] <Cork> that is true for a few other properties too though
[08:54:31] <Diplomat> :/ I can't get it to slide..
[08:54:43] <Diplomat> Basically I want it to start sliding on click
[08:54:44] <Cork> are you trying to make a slideshow?
[08:54:53] <Diplomat> Nope, just an information box
[08:55:03] <Diplomat> That slides behind another box
[08:55:11] <Cork> Diplomat: update the jsfiddle with what you have/need
[08:56:56] <Diplomat> I really dont have anything right now.. http://stackoverflow.com/a/31819499/1303098 this seems interesting
[08:57:23] <taplar> sounds like a 'make me something' situtation, :P
[08:57:28] <taplar> what have you tried dude?
[08:57:31] <Cork> ya, except you don't need animation
[08:57:57] <Cork> Diplomat: ya, what i gave you should give you like 70+% of what you asked for...
[08:58:06] <Diplomat> taplar: good luck with that man
[08:58:16] <Cork> <_<'
[08:58:26] <taplar> huh?  i'm talking about you
[08:58:40] <taplar> your asking for something but you say you don't have anything yet
[08:58:55] <taplar> we're here to help you lean, not provide whole solutions
[08:58:59] <taplar> *learn
[08:59:14] <Diplomat> taplar: you mad, bruh? I wasn't asking for a complete solutions
[08:59:27] <Diplomat> If I would have, would have I searched stuff myself ?
[08:59:30] <Diplomat> cmon
[08:59:30] <decx> name makes this perfect
[08:59:33] <taplar> "i want this"  "i don't have anything"
[08:59:52] <Cork> Diplomat: if that is the case then fill in the blanks in the jsfiddle
[09:00:05] <Cork> that would prove the fakt
[09:00:09] <Diplomat> I didn't have anything because I was searching for stuff and playing around with them to make sure they are what I need
[09:00:26] <Cork> Diplomat: the jsfiddle i gave you should give you all you need
[09:00:33] <taplar> ^
[09:00:34] <Cork> you just have to apply it
[09:10:09] <taplar> great start to the morning, ^^
[09:11:22] <Diplomat> That's good man, that's real good
[09:11:50] <taplar> ikr
[09:12:42] <Diplomat> I understand that it's morning for you, but you should not start assuming things so fast, not everyone is here to just to get stuff done by others
[09:12:46] <Diplomat> Anyway
[09:12:53] <Diplomat> I got that shit working, thanks Cork
[09:13:45] <taplar> hard to assume stuff when you explicitly typed it out
[09:15:53] <Diplomat> I understand where the confusion came in, but still.. it's better to confirm your assumption with additional questions first ;)
[09:16:59] <decx> weird ass conversation
[09:17:08] <taplar> :)
[09:17:33] <taplar> you know you like the conflict decx, :P
[09:22:39] <Diplomat> https://jsfiddle.net/31bda3hj/ <--
[09:24:23] <taplar> cool, you should cache some selectors though
[09:24:48] <taplar> actually ln 3 you are, your just not using it below
[09:24:58] <Diplomat> yup, gotta clean it up a bit
[09:28:42] <taplar> do you ever put the display none back on the infobox?
[09:30:03] <Diplomat> Yup
[09:30:14] <Diplomat> It's on by default
[09:30:38] <taplar> right, but after the first time it's removed with the toggle()
[09:30:48] <taplar> and afterwards your using just the slide-in and slide-out
[09:30:58] <taplar> that visible if seems strange to me in that aspect
[09:31:59] <Diplomat> Yes, on the first click it it will be set visible.. but it's not removed because of why not. It's not required to be "hidden", it's behind a table
[09:32:05] <taplar> i guess i wonder if you could have it start out in the slide-out state so you could simplify that
[09:32:52] <Diplomat> yes, tried that.. but it starts sliding out from the visible place so it starts by sliding out and then sliding in
[09:33:10] <Diplomat> Which wouldn't have made any sense.. so easiest fix for it would be to just hide it which is totally fine
[10:07:16] <codecutter> moment('2016-07-07 11:50:00').fromNow() -> Moment construction falls back to js Date. This is discouraged and will be removed in an upcoming major release.
[10:15:03] <hop> is there no "getting started" document for jquery-mobile any more?
[10:16:26] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-mobile/ ?
[10:17:57] <jaggz> what's a nice small way of reloading a page's content into a div every 5 seconds?
[10:18:20] <Cork> jaggz: ajax request the html partial and replace the content
[10:19:06] <Cork> and by partial i mean have the server have a separate url where it sends just the content of that div
[10:19:16] <jaggz> but a nice small line for it?  I was going to use setTimer() but noticed some $('#foo').delay(5000).text('new text'); thing.. and felt maybe a nice line like that would work
[10:19:20] <hop> taplar: yes, like that. is there a direkt link to there _anywhere_ on jquerymobile.com?
[10:19:52] <taplar> not that i found.  i found a link to learn, and from there i found the jquery mobile section
[10:20:13] <Cork> jaggz: function update() { setTimeout(function() { $('#the-div').load(url, update); }, 5000); } update();
[10:21:27] <momomo> is there a way to import a font not using an @import statement or @font-face ? i need to know when the resource is actually loaded .. I am thinkg of a link tag like functionality?
[10:21:55] <Cork> momomo: font-face is the only way
[10:22:09] <Cork> momomo: there are js hooks for events though
[10:22:22] <momomo> hmm ... standard hooks?
[10:22:25] <momomo> jquery?
[10:22:33] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FontFace
[10:22:36] <jaggz> cork, not as pretty as I hoped -- but beautiful enough!  thank you :)
[10:23:15] <momomo> Cork, ff and chrome only it seems.. although I am having issues with chrome only .. so maybe
[10:24:23] <Cork> momomo: @font-face is async by design
[10:24:41] <Cork> it is expected not to block rendering
[10:24:42] <momomo> chrome is not loading my font in some cases .. not sure why
[10:25:05] <Cork> it is loading it, but that doesn't mean it has to use it
[10:25:21] <momomo> why would it not? it's declared as a fallback
[10:25:24] <Cork> if the unicode char doesn't match in the font they will subsitute with a font that has it
[10:25:32] <jaggz> cork, working beautifully too :)
[10:25:52] <Cork> and that font doesn't even have to be in the font-family list
[10:26:53] <momomo> Cork, yes, that's what happening.. it doesnt use it .. .but when I refresh the link to the css ( dynamically during development not to have to hit refresh ) eventually the font will get right .. normal refresh without js refresh does not ..
[10:27:13] <momomo> so i think its a bug in chrome .. since eventually it will get it right
[10:27:16] <momomo> ff does this fine too
[10:27:20] <Cork> ya, sounds like it
[10:27:34] <Cork> the only thing i can think of there is cache miss
[10:27:45] <Cork> so the font gets removed from cache so it can't use it
[10:27:54] <momomo> font cache is impossible to inspect in chrome
[10:28:00] <momomo> it doesnt even show it as loaded resource
[10:28:20] <momomo> actually it does :S
[10:29:00] <baako> hi guys i have a form http://kopy.io/DRoEs what i want to do is stop this from from submitting if the checkbox hasnt been checked. the problem is that the form has a html onclick to it. how can i still prevent this? i tried this http://kopy.io/3h8SX
[10:29:03] <momomo> but it seems to only load it on certain cases
[10:29:31] <baako> but that didnt stop it because the page form still submit
[10:29:37] <Cork> baako: i would strongly recommend converting that onclick to a real handler
[10:29:45] <momomo> like when I resize the window a couple of times it will eventually load the font
[10:29:56] <baako> Cork, is they a way of doing it without checking the onclick?
[10:30:12] <Cork> not really
[10:30:23] <Cork> they are calling form.submit that doesn't trigger events
[10:30:30] <Cork> so you're kinda screwed
[10:31:10] <Cork> baako: the only option you have is to replace the onclick attribute
[10:31:35] <Cork> (and is an example of why i always nag about not using event attributes...)
[10:31:47] <baako> Cork, so i still need to check the html?
[10:31:56] <Cork> well not html, but the element
[10:32:11] <baako> might has well remove the onlick
[10:32:22] <baako> if they is no way without changing it
[10:32:45] <Cork> you can add an event listener to the button, but it will be called after there submit call
[10:32:47] <Cork> so...
[10:32:57] <Cork> ya, there isn't really an option
[10:35:04] <eynix> Hi everyone
[10:35:33] <baako> Cork, if i remove that onclick and do something like this? http://kopy.io/RwDku
[10:36:00] <sillyslux> hey baako :)
[10:36:07] <Cork> baako: you can call e.preventDefault(); every time if you want, it doesn't matter
[10:36:13] <eynix> I have a strange question : is this possible to create en empty elem from a selector ? like .selector -> $('<span class="selector">/span>)
[10:36:19] <Cork> baako: also preventDefault() doesn't take an argument
[10:36:34] <eynix> context : I pass a selector as a param but I have to fill a tag using that.
[10:36:37] <Cork> eynix: that isn't a selector
[10:36:39] <Cork> but yes
[10:36:40] <eynix> kindda stuck, new to js.
[10:36:51] <baako> hi sillyslux
[10:36:53] <eynix> Cork: oh, my bad, I though it was
[10:36:54] <Cork> $('<span class="selector"></span>) will create a span
[10:36:55] <sillyslux> what are you doing?
[10:37:22] <Cork> though i would recommend writing it as $('<span>', { class: 'selector' })
[10:37:37] <sillyslux> you can hide the button with css and show a dummy button that won't invoke form.submit
[10:37:40] <eynix> Cork: the tag in itself isn't an issue, but I can't figure out how to retrieve class/id/etc from a string
[10:37:56] <eynix> Cork: thanks for the tips, feel prettier this way indeed
[10:38:01] <Cork> "from a string"?
[10:38:07] <Cork> you mean you have a blob of html?
[10:38:29] <eynix> my en isn't that good.hmm.
[10:38:48] <Cork> eynix: make a jsfiddle.net showing what you're trying to do
[10:39:00] <Cork> its normally more effective then explaining :)
[10:39:09] <sillyslux> maybe something like [name="disBox"] + [name="view"]{display:none} [name="disBox"]:checked + [name="view"]{display:block}
[10:40:03] <eynix> Cork: (".class1 .class2 .class3 #id1", "span") --> "<span class='class1 class2 class3' id='id1'></span>"
[10:40:32] <Cork> you can't convert a selector into attributes on an element
[10:40:51] <Cork> especially that one as the classes aren't for the same element
[10:41:03] <eynix> well, I must to :/
[10:41:09] <eynix> and I don't want to parse string
[10:41:39] <Cork> if anything (".class1 .class2 .class3 #id1", "span") would be <span class="class1"><span class="class2"><span class="class3"><span id="id1">
[10:41:46] <Cork> as that is what the selector matches
[10:41:46] <eynix> I was wondering if jQuery could create a empty elem with the given props (".class1 .class2 .class3#id1", "span"), and use it to fill my tag
[10:42:07] <Cork> eynix: no it can't
[10:42:15] <eynix> uuuuuuh :'(
[10:42:17] <Cork> you can't really map a selector that way
[10:44:32] <eynix> Cork: some code anyway, if you want to take a look
[10:44:39] <eynix> Cork: it's minimal: https://jsfiddle.net/47u893wg/
[10:46:06] <eynix> Cork: it's used to search text in the html text
[10:46:15] <eynix> sorry for my english btw
[10:46:17] <Cork> ya, i see that
[10:46:37] <sillyslux> baako, https://jsfiddle.net/bmva9qd3/
[10:46:46] <Cork> i don't really have a comment though, a little too much code to dig through for that
[10:46:56] <eynix> ^^ np
[10:47:25] <eynix> thank you for your answer (and I think you were the one who help me write this in the firts place :p)
[10:48:02] <momomo> Cork, is there any point in putting a style tag with just font-face import statement directly in the header vs inside the css file ?
[10:48:13] <Cork> no
[10:48:25] <Cork> font-face _NEVER_ blocks rendering the page
[10:48:25] <momomo> will that not load the font before the css is actually loaded ?
[10:48:31] <Cork> by design
[10:48:52] <momomo> Cork, but will my font be loaded faster than inside the css ?
[10:49:03] <Cork> no
[10:49:05] <momomo> because it possibly starts before css is even loaded
[10:49:08] <Cork> well slightly
[10:49:18] <momomo> ahh .. now we are getting somewhere
[10:49:18] <Cork> as it has to load the css resource before it knows to load it
[10:49:23] <momomo> yes
[10:49:24] <Cork> but it shouldn't matter
[10:57:08] <sillyslux> baako, baako where are you?
[10:57:11] <sillyslux> https://jsfiddle.net/bmva9qd3/1/
[10:57:56] <baako> am here sillyslux
[10:58:21] <sillyslux> are you working?
[11:34:48] <Koopz> http://pastebin.com/E5s2xyZS <- what the heck is this?
[11:34:51] <Koopz> i don't...
[11:36:03] <Koopz> my brain debugger is having segfaults while trying to understand what's going on with those braces
[11:48:20] <mmmveggies> why the hell even type check an IIFE if you're passing it a literal
[11:49:51] <mmmveggies> oh nevermind
[11:49:56] <mmmveggies> still pretty rank
[11:57:52] <fission6> how would i handle a button click and execute code but first prompt the user to confirm the action with a modal/popup?
[11:58:25] <fission6> i basically have a click handler which works and everything is fine but was asked to put a confirmation box in between the click and the actions
[12:02:36] <Velveeta> well, you could use the confirm() function for that.. if you want it to look prettier than the native confirm dialog, there should be plenty of 3rd party options for that also
[12:02:47] <Diplomat> You can first have click that opens your modal and then on "Agree" or whatever button triggers your action
[12:02:57] <Velveeta> if (confirm('are you sure you want to do this?')) { action(); }
[12:21:38] <w3gi> Cork, ping?
[12:28:06] <robertmaxrees> w3gi he might not be, but other people are around :)
[12:30:33] <w3gi> we talked yesterday about a 3d spin with zoom image function, i can show you the code if you want
[12:31:01] <robertmaxrees> you can ask the channel.
[12:31:09] <robertmaxrees> if anybody can help, they will :)
[12:31:29] <w3gi> http://jsfiddle.net/rd3oxpq3/3/
[12:31:51] <w3gi> now i wanted to add a zoom function but i get a easier id...
[12:31:55] <w3gi> idea
[12:32:33] <w3gi> i want to add a button wich zooms the image from fitting to fullsize
[12:32:55] <w3gi> so far so good but how i can do the dragging arround of that image
[12:33:11] <w3gi> i mean dragging the image inside of the box
[12:34:05] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have some extra code that you're not showing in that fiddle.
[12:34:24] <robertmaxrees> also: yopu don't add body tags in jsfiddle btw.
[12:35:05] <w3gi> i just mean theoretically... would be easier i guess then a zoom box outside and a cusor inside the box
[12:35:44] <w3gi> my problem is how to address or find out wich of the <li>-elements are active or wich is on top
[12:35:50] <w3gi> which is shown
[12:38:10] <robertmaxrees> looks like you're running show/hide methods as necessary.  could also add a class to get the active one.
[12:38:21] <robertmaxrees> or just use a class and use css to hide/show.
[12:39:52] <Twirl> $('.del').click(function(e) {  e.preventDefault();  alert('a');}); is working in the console but not in the script, why?
[12:40:08] <robertmaxrees> your code is coming before the element.
[12:40:42] <robertmaxrees> Twirl ^
[12:41:03] <Twirl> alright, nice
[12:41:15] <robertmaxrees> are you dynamically creating that element?
[12:41:53] <Twirl> yea
[12:41:56] <Twirl> It came from ajax
[12:41:58] <robertmaxrees> that's your other problem.
[12:42:05] <Twirl> easy fix?
[12:42:07] <robertmaxrees> you should use a delegated listener instead.
[12:42:15] <w3gi> robertmaxrees, so 1st step is add a button to each .treeDviewWraper which address the correct instance and bind a onclick event wich also tells the function wich instance to use
[12:42:23] <Twirl> what?
[12:42:34] <robertmaxrees> Twirl https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[12:42:49] <robertmaxrees> w3gi errr, start with the class thing.
[12:42:54] <robertmaxrees> instead of adding a bunch of extra markup.
[12:43:02] <robertmaxrees> you can overlay controls pretty easily.
[12:43:07] <w3gi> then i have to fins out wich li-element is visible and zoom it to e.g. to 1200px
[12:43:18] <w3gi> ok
[12:43:25] <robertmaxrees> w3gi right - having a "visible" class will make that easy.
[12:43:36] <Twirl> isnt easier to say "add the listener to the parent"
[12:43:39] <robertmaxrees> Twirl make sure to actually read that btw.  people skip to the first example they see and get it wrong.
[12:43:48] <robertmaxrees> Twirl because you're doing more than adding a listener to the parent.
[12:43:52] <w3gi> yes but if i have 10 spins on a page i need to know wich one i need to zoom
[12:43:57] <Twirl> it literally says that
[12:44:01] <robertmaxrees> you're also adding the second arg to .on()
[12:44:19] <w3gi> zooming an moving i have solved
[12:44:42] <w3gi> my problem is to find out wich li in which spin i have to zoom
[12:44:44] <robertmaxrees> w3gi ... if you add a class to the visible element, you can just select via that class to get the currently visible one.
[12:45:13] <robertmaxrees> Twirl it also says a lot of other things.  it's about the delegated syntax of .on() as well :)
[12:45:26] <w3gi> ok that i get but if i have 10 spins i have 10 visible li-elements
[12:45:35] <robertmaxrees> you would also remove it...
[12:45:43] <robertmaxrees> instead of using show/hide you'd add/remove classes.
[12:45:52] <w3gi> so i need to find out which ones are in zoom-mode and which ones in spin-mode
[12:46:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:46:05] <robertmaxrees> i feel like you're getting lost.
[12:46:35] <w3gi> think on a web page... you dont display 1 spin you can display 2, 3 or 20
[12:46:49] <robertmaxrees> w3gi right...? you can select relative to the element that was clicked.
[12:47:03] <w3gi> ok how to do that?
[12:47:21] <w3gi> the class thing is a good tipp. thanks for that so far
[12:48:20] <robertmaxrees> have you read the jquery learning center at all?
[12:48:24] <robertmaxrees> or the docs for .on()
[12:48:43] <robertmaxrees> they cover the event handler and it's environment, as well as the event object.
[12:49:18] <w3gi> some stuff yes, i also have watched a tutorial dvd but as that is my first jquery project i am still a bit lost :(
[12:50:07] <robertmaxrees> so i'd hit those up.  in the meantime, the 'this' object in the handler is the element that was clicked.
[12:50:19] <robertmaxrees> you can get a jquery object out of that by doing $(this)
[12:51:22] <w3gi> so btn has a onclick and that triggers a function wich get the event, the event tells me which exact button is it and over that i get the parent element from which i can find out the li-element
[12:51:26] <w3gi> i guess i get it
[12:51:27] <robertmaxrees> Twirl you figure it out?
[12:51:39] <robertmaxrees> w3gi right.
[12:52:09] <w3gi> thx, as far as i have a plan i can find out the rest with the docs...
[12:52:25] <robertmaxrees> i'd check out the learning center, too :)
[12:53:24] <w3gi> i am more in learning by doing... so i select that concrete project to create... otherwise i could just use a finnish plugin :)
[12:53:43] <robertmaxrees> w3gi okay?  the learning center is a good resource either way.
[12:53:47] <robertmaxrees> kind of like the docs.
[12:53:53] <robertmaxrees> explains a lot for you and clarifies things.
[12:54:16] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily suggesting you sit down and read through it all.
[12:54:24] <w3gi> robertmaxrees, yes all fine, thanks... now i have my "homework" for tonight :)
[12:54:47] <robertmaxrees> rad
[12:55:38] <w3gi> i have some good german sources as well, but easier when i know what to search for. and i prefer to read that technical stuff in my native language - so i have a smaller chance to missunderstand some stuff
[12:55:50] <w3gi> have a nice evening
[12:55:55] <robertmaxrees> that's fair.  just pointing out other resources you have available :)
[12:56:14] <cannap> was weisch du nicht
[12:57:43] <w3gi> cannap, glaub ich hab schon einen brauchbaren plan das hinzubekommen
[12:57:55] <w3gi> oder hast eine elegantere idee?
[12:58:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:58:11] <cannap> ich weiss gar nicht um was es geht und wenn wir deutsch schreiben muss du mir das im query sagen
[12:58:12] <cannap> ^^
[12:58:47] <cannap> because here is english only
[12:58:49] <cannap> or
[13:06:23] <Twirl>     $(".e").forEach((element) => {      console.log(this);    }); can't do this?
[13:07:04] <robertmaxrees> forEach() isn't a method on the jquery object.
[13:07:07] <robertmaxrees> .each() is.
[13:07:11] <cannap> ,each
[13:07:12] <cannap> .
[13:07:19] <cannap> so fast robert :D
[13:07:39] <Twirl> and how do you access the element?
[13:08:00] <Twirl> this is showing the one that fired the click event
[13:08:11] <robertmaxrees> are you inside an event handler?
[13:08:22] <Twirl> yea
[13:08:25] <robertmaxrees> because fat arrow functions use the same scope and context as the parent function iirc.
[13:08:43] <robertmaxrees> either use a regular function or check out the event object for that stuff.
[13:08:55] <robertmaxrees> though most mehtods will "each" over the collection for you.
[13:09:44] <Twirl> console.log(this) is showing the element that fired the click
[13:09:48] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[13:09:58] <robertmaxrees> because the 'this' object inside fat arrows is from the parent context.
[13:09:58] <Twirl> I need the selected elements
[13:10:51] <Twirl> alright
[13:10:53] <robertmaxrees> then you want to use a regular function or take a look at the arguments each passes.
[13:11:45] <robertmaxrees> is passes the callbacks index and element
[13:11:51] <robertmaxrees> err, the arguments to the callback rather.
[13:12:23] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c0d6so47/
[13:12:25] <robertmaxrees> so you could do this.
[13:51:49] <z1haze_work> can I get a css property actual value with jquery?
[13:52:04] <z1haze_work> like i want to get the background: url property value
[13:52:18] <taplar> css('background')
[13:52:26] <robertmaxrees> ^ or background-url
[13:52:41] <taplar> not sure if that only works for inline or not
[13:53:13] <z1haze_work> does background-url apply to background: url()
[13:53:22] <robertmaxrees> i think that nabs the computed value iirc.
[13:53:28] <robertmaxrees> give it a shot and see what happens.
[13:53:42] <z1haze_work> alright will do
[14:23:49] <z1haze_work> looks like url just comes back undefined robertmaxrees
[14:24:14] <z1haze_work> background-image gives me the whole url("path") anyone good with regex to help extract the actual url
[14:30:31] <z1haze_work> nvm i just use a data-attr and add the url there
[14:40:30] <Gsham> any lightbox plugin that deals with retina images?
[15:01:03] <z1haze_work> can you compare elements to see if they are the same element?
[15:01:22] <z1haze_work> like var self = $(this) if(self == $(event.currentTarget)) {
[15:01:53] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/is/ z1haze
[15:04:00] <z1haze_work> hmm like if(self.is($(event.currentTarget))) { ?
[15:04:25] <robertmaxrees> it'd be $(this).is(event.currentTarget)
[15:04:54] <robertmaxrees> you could also do http://api.jquery.com/event.currentTarget/
[15:05:14] <z1haze_work> agh failing miserably, all im trying to do is toggle up other siblings each time you toggle one down, like only show 1 at a time
[15:05:29] <z1haze_work> but theres more stuff i have to do other than just slideup
[15:05:30] <robertmaxrees> then hide all and show the current one.
[15:07:00] <z1haze_work> thats basically what im doing
[15:07:09] <z1haze_work> i got it working with is() i just needed to check the inverse
[15:07:17] <robertmaxrees> err, ok?
[15:07:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:07:22] <robertmaxrees> confused abvout where the problem was, then :)
[15:07:26] <z1haze_work> if(!self.is(event.currentTarget)
[15:07:37] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:07:42] <robertmaxrees> is "self" set to $(this)?
[15:07:46] <z1haze_work> yes
[15:08:00] <robertmaxrees> make it $self or something like that - `self` implies `this`
[15:08:30] <z1haze_work> http://dev04-web-kendo.demandware.net/on/demandware.store/Sites-MJB-Site/default/Home-Show is what im trying to do if you find the 'shop this look' in the middle of the page
[15:10:22] <robertmaxrees> a video?
[15:10:38] <z1haze_work> no
[15:10:42] <z1haze_work> click the shop this look text
[15:11:00] <z1haze_work> this little gem was fun
[15:11:17] <robertmaxrees> why are things moving?
[15:11:52] <z1haze_work> lol
[15:11:57] <z1haze_work> because that client wanted it man
[15:12:03] <z1haze_work> i dont dream this up
[15:12:09] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:12:17] <robertmaxrees> i always wonder why people don't argue against bad ui and ux.
[15:12:24] <z1haze_work> shes kinda eccentric
[15:12:35] <robertmaxrees> you're the expert - the client hired you to make the site work.  they should trust your expertise.
[15:12:37] <z1haze_work> she wants to be 'new and hip'
[15:12:46] <z1haze_work> we build what they ask for, to the T
[15:12:54] <robertmaxrees> that's terrifying.
[15:13:07] <z1haze_work> our fsd's are like dozens of pages
[15:13:35] <z1haze_work> why do you think its bad ui though?
[15:13:36] <robertmaxrees> should be a much more collaborative process.
[15:13:48] <robertmaxrees> things moving unnecessarily is way distracting.
[15:14:24] <z1haze_work> i guess, i dunno. they specifically asked for something like the isotope plugin
[15:14:25] <robertmaxrees> i'm all for a small flourish, but why move the other products when the tooltip covers one?  no need to.  give me a close button or something.
[15:14:41] <z1haze_work> wel lthatsthe tink
[15:14:48] <z1haze_work> wow, that was bad.. thats the thing
[15:14:55] <z1haze_work> they dont want to ever cover their product
[15:15:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:15:05] <z1haze_work> and instead of pushing it down, they wanted this fancy shifting
[15:15:13] <robertmaxrees> don't do anything is what i'm saying.
[15:15:34] <z1haze_work> so how do you know the info on it?
[15:15:36] <robertmaxrees> we have a search page view that pops out more info when you over over a product.
[15:15:51] <robertmaxrees> that extra data covers the product directly below it.
[15:15:54] <z1haze_work> we have a quickview for the products too
[15:16:00] <robertmaxrees> then it hides when your mouse leaves.
[15:16:02] <z1haze_work> and product page itself
[15:16:11] <z1haze_work> yea i dunno
[15:16:12] <z1haze_work> lol
[15:16:57] <z1haze_work> just to make em happy we give em what they want.. they are pretty successful, have like 6 fashion companies and about to do a big product line with rihanna
[15:17:08] <robertmaxrees> i know who marc jacobs is.
[15:17:16] <z1haze_work> i didnt
[15:17:23] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:17:31] <z1haze_work> when i did this video page was the first i saw any of it
[15:17:33] <z1haze_work> its kinda scary
[15:17:56] <z1haze_work> literally their fashion shows look like circus tryouts
[15:18:15] <z1haze_work> look how gross this is http://dev04-web-kendo.demandware.net/on/demandware.store/Sites-MJB-Site/default/Search-ShowContent?fdid=videos-featured
[15:18:17] <arc_> that's what all fashion shows look like
[15:18:21] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[15:18:22] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:18:22] <z1haze_work> haha
[15:18:36] <arc_> but that's not really the point
[15:18:48] <z1haze_work> its not?
[15:18:48] <arc_> the stuff they actually make for people to buy and wear is always much more normal
[15:18:57] <z1haze_work> whats the objective of these shows
[15:19:20] <arc_> i'm not really qualified to explain it
[15:19:22] <robertmaxrees> think concept cars.
[15:19:24] <z1haze_work> haha
[15:19:31] <arc_> yeah that's a good comparison
[15:19:51] <z1haze_work> i suppose
[15:42:59] <aro> is there a way to use bootstrap events and prevent a followup one from executing if there was a hide click executed
[15:43:29] <aro> for example, i have on('shown') and on('hide') - if shown is called, it automatically calls the hide first
[15:43:38] <aro> to hide the previous open accordion
[15:43:52] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to allow multiple accordions to be opened?
[15:43:53] <aro> if a user hides one manually, id like that event to be processed
[15:43:58] <aro> robertmaxrees: not at all
[15:44:15] <aro> the user can manually close the open menu so that all are in a hidden state
[15:44:20] <aro> (as is default functionality)
[15:44:57] <aro> my quesiton is - if i have one open, and two closed - the user clicks a closed one to open that. Id like to prevent the event that is called one the first menu is hidden, from being executed
[15:45:04] <aro> i know i cant actually prevent the event from firing
[15:45:14] <aro> but i wondered if there was an event i could attach to it
[15:45:36] <aro> to basically to check to see if there was a click invoked on the other
[15:45:40] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean bind a listener to it?  sure.  but i'm not sure why you'd want to do that :)
[15:45:56] <robertmaxrees> ah.  not without some very unusual state management.
[15:46:00] <aro> why not? because i have a scrollTo function that executes on both hide and on shown
[15:46:06] <aro> i dont want the scroll to execute twice
[15:46:13] <aro> see what i mean?
[15:46:42] <robertmaxrees> why not have it fire just on shown?  (since i don't have your page in front of me it's hard to visualize the problem you're solving.
[15:46:43] <robertmaxrees> )
[15:46:49] <aro> because
[15:47:02] <aro> if they close the menu (have no accordions open) then it wont fire
[15:47:24] <robertmaxrees> where would you scroll the user in that case?
[15:47:28] <aro> to the top of the page
[15:47:37] <aro> scrollTop: 0
[15:47:49] <aro> where the top accordion is
[15:47:49] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  interesting.  i'm not sure exactly how you'd accomplish that.  sorry :)
[15:47:58] <aro> damn it, i was afraid of that
[15:48:32] <robertmaxrees> i dunno that i'd worry about the close functionality personally, but that's just me.  i'm sure you have a document saying you have to do otherwise or something :)
[15:49:04] <aro> i wasnt sure if you could use some sort of stop propagation
[15:49:30] <robertmaxrees> they're seperate events, and you'll still have to manage state elsewhere.
[15:49:50] <aro> ya
[16:05:45] <aro> i managed to make it work by maintaining the state elsewhere
[16:05:55] <aro> is there a way to determine if the bottom of a container is inside the viewport?
[16:06:31] <robertmaxrees> not directly.  get the top of the container, add its height, and check that number.
[17:10:16] <vacho> if checkboxes are empty, it's not included in the POST body... how can I with jQuery include empty checkboxes?
[17:10:24] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[17:10:34] <robertmaxrees> unless you use ajax.
[17:10:58] <vacho> I can't hook into $("form").submit(function () {} and add the variables?
[17:11:46] <robertmaxrees> you can try but i'm like 95% sure that's not going to work.
[17:11:53] <robertmaxrees> i don't think you can modify the post body like that.
[17:12:26] <taplar> it's not standard to return unchecked checkboxes on a form submit
[17:12:35] <taplar> just know that if they are not passed, they were not checked
[17:12:41] <robertmaxrees> ^ that's the other awkward part
[17:13:30] <robertmaxrees> your backend shouldn't rely on them being there.  if it does, stick a decorator somewhere to handle that part.
[17:16:03] <taplar> the wierdness stems from that a checkbox is not true or false, as your probably thinking about it
[17:39:56] <taplar> pokemon have taken over...
[17:47:17] <z1haze_work> anyone used backbone here? I am trying to figure out the point of all these different js frameworks that seem to do the same thing
[17:47:57] <z1haze_work> I also discovered this pjax lib that looks like if you already have a backend and a templating engine, you can just use pjax to make a spa?
[17:52:17] <robertmaxrees> that's not what PJAX does :)
[17:53:02] <robertmaxrees> pjax is a quick and dirty way to ajax in a particular part of your site.
[17:53:06] <taplar> i haven't used backbone.  just started using lodash last week or so
[17:53:20] <robertmaxrees> i've used backbone, which has underscore as a dep (which is what inspired lodash)
[17:53:33] <robertmaxrees> and the reason they all exist is they all approach similar problems differently.
[17:53:58] <z1haze_work> well i tried watching  a bunch of tuts on angular i just couldnt find how it would fit my needs
[17:54:09] <taplar> what is your need?
[17:54:11] <robertmaxrees> I wouldn't default to using pjax personally.  i'd build out the site explicitly to do that.  pjax is a nice way to get ajaxed content quickly going on your pages.
[17:54:32] <z1haze_work> i just want to create a dashboard app for my projects and works with ajax
[17:54:35] <robertmaxrees> angular is a full blown mvc with templating.  backbone is just the mvc part.
[17:54:45] <z1haze_work> i already use laravel for my backend which has blade templating
[17:55:01] <z1haze_work> i plan to just return views with the data vs returning the data and then parse into the view
[17:55:08] <z1haze_work> and i didnt see how angular would make that easier
[17:55:17] <robertmaxrees> angular just makes it different.
[17:55:20] <robertmaxrees> same with backbone and react.
[17:55:33] <robertmaxrees> all about where you're more comfortable working and what you prefer dealing with.
[17:55:38] <z1haze_work> what would you recommend then? basically i already have the complete structure
[17:55:43] <z1haze_work> i just want an ajaxy feel
[17:55:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:55:49] <robertmaxrees> backbone in that case.
[17:55:53] <z1haze_work> heh
[17:55:56] <robertmaxrees> you can use just the models and views.
[17:56:00] <taplar> if your returning views already i'd probably stick with plain ajax calls.  only thing you'd lose is the push state stuff perhaps
[17:56:06] <robertmaxrees> or do that.
[17:56:13] <z1haze_work> yea i want to have push state
[17:56:20] <z1haze_work> but pjax supports push state
[17:56:24] <taplar> fairly easy to write, imho
[17:56:40] <z1haze_work> taplar: thats kind awhat i already do
[17:56:46] <z1haze_work> it just gets messy after a while
[17:56:48] <robertmaxrees> pjax doesn't really manage much else for you.  it's great as a shoehorn drop-in to legacy apps.
[17:56:52] <robertmaxrees> i'd go with backbone here.
[17:57:06] <z1haze_work> alright, i watched a bit about backbone last night, will do more tonight after work
[17:57:15] <robertmaxrees> the issue is you're already rendering serverside, so you'll need to expose your templates clientside somehow.
[17:57:16] <z1haze_work> It did seem far less complicated than angular though
[17:57:20] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're shoving over markup.
[17:57:23] <robertmaxrees> that's because it does far less.
[17:57:39] <robertmaxrees> also: angular was designed by java developers, so it's very different in its opinions.
[17:57:52] <taplar> backbone would still be considered just a library, right?
[17:57:56] <z1haze_work> i mean i can just return data, i just like laravels blade template engine, its easy to parse out your data in the view there
[17:57:56] <robertmaxrees> framework.
[17:57:57] <taplar> while angular is a framework
[17:58:00] <taplar> hmm
[17:58:11] <z1haze_work> what i read says backbone is more mvc though
[17:58:13] <robertmaxrees> backbone makes use of underscore.
[17:58:21] <robertmaxrees> angular is pretty mvc as well.
[17:58:22] <z1haze_work> even though it depends on jquery
[17:58:22] <z1haze_work> yes that too
[17:58:25] <z1haze_work> which ive never used
[17:58:33] <robertmaxrees> neither require jquery
[17:58:52] <z1haze_work> yea which is almos a turn off for me
[17:58:57] <z1haze_work> i never realyl learned vanilla js
[17:59:02] <robertmaxrees> learn it :)
[17:59:07] <z1haze_work> and then i have to learn typescript
[17:59:10] <robertmaxrees> or don't.  either way, try out backbone in this case.
[17:59:17] <z1haze_work> i felt with backbone id have less to learn
[17:59:23] <z1haze_work> yea, will do thank you
[17:59:49] <z1haze_work> is backbone kinda on its own with how it works
[17:59:57] <z1haze_work> vs reactjs or vuejs and angular
[18:00:04] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[18:00:18] <z1haze_work> the concept of how you use it/ how it works
[18:00:18] <robertmaxrees> it's like any other MVC - it has a particular methodology that it uses to accomplish things.
[18:00:23] <robertmaxrees> every framework is like that.
[18:00:38] <z1haze_work> wonder why i go tthe impression backbone was so much more simple
[18:00:47] <robertmaxrees> because it is.
[18:01:02] <z1haze_work> is it a bad idea to render my templates server side and just load them in with ajax?
[18:01:14] <robertmaxrees> depends on the case.
[18:01:26] <robertmaxrees> but generally, yeah.  i'd just shunt the data over - less bandwidth
[18:01:32] <z1haze_work> i mean my application is done, it works everytings fine, just doesnt have the spa feel
[18:01:42] <z1haze_work> ok well cool
[18:01:43] <taplar> less bandwidth is important with phones
[18:01:44] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:01:46] <robertmaxrees> hold up.
[18:02:01] <robertmaxrees> you keep saying "spa feel" - are you interested in the actual benefits of an SPA?
[18:02:08] <z1haze_work> question though, all the templates have to be stored in the front end then.. and from what i watched all in script text/template blocks
[18:02:18] <z1haze_work> i mean, what are the 'benefits'
[18:02:46] <z1haze_work> i want to have push state and the behavior of spa , other than that i dont think i care
[18:02:47] <robertmaxrees> you realize you're a little late in the game to be making an SPA, right?
[18:02:47] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:02:57] <z1haze_work> heh is that out of style now?
[18:03:01] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:03:08] <robertmaxrees> i mean in the lifecycle of your application.
[18:03:11] <taplar> your saying you already have a full blown working app
[18:03:14] <z1haze_work> oh yea
[18:03:15] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:03:20] <z1haze_work> well still
[18:03:23] <robertmaxrees> SPAs require a different architecture and approah.
[18:03:24] <z1haze_work> learning is good
[18:03:32] <robertmaxrees> "SPA feel" doesn't really mean anything.
[18:03:50] <z1haze_work> well then thats why i said a bit ago, i want to have push state, but load everything with ajax
[18:03:54] <z1haze_work> to me, thats spa lol
[18:04:14] <robertmaxrees> except you already built the app.
[18:04:21] <robertmaxrees> SPA requires that the backend is build with that in mind.
[18:04:37] <robertmaxrees> so you'll need to change some things there fwiw.
[18:04:48] <robertmaxrees> and with that, I need to go.  I have a gig soon :)  enjoy folks.
[18:05:25] <z1haze_work> alright, well thanks for the input, ttyl
[18:09:36] <taplar> hasta luego
[19:34:32] <Gsham> whats wrong with this... $('.menu-search input').focus(); i cant get it to focus on the input
[19:37:03] <Gsham> chrome too fast? i used set time out and now it wokrs
[19:54:58] <acidjazz> Gsham:
[19:55:01] <acidjazz> open up your console
[19:55:07] <Gsham> ok?
[19:55:11] <acidjazz> and type $('.menu-search input').length
[19:55:17] <acidjazz> what do you get
[19:55:23] <Gsham> some number
[19:55:26] <acidjazz> not 0
[19:55:26] <Gsham> there is text insdie
[19:55:30] <Gsham> its a search bar
[19:55:34] <acidjazz> is it 1 or more than 1
[19:55:36] <Gsham> on liad i wanted it to be focused
[19:55:42] <Gsham> more than 1
[19:55:44] <acidjazz> right so answer me
[19:55:52] <acidjazz> ok so that selector is targeting multiple input texts
[19:55:58] <acidjazz> you caon only focus 1 of them
[19:56:16] <Gsham> oh no... right
[19:56:21] <Gsham> in my code i actually put
[19:56:28] <Gsham> input[type="search"
[19:56:30] <acidjazz> so you need to do something in the order of .menu-search input:first-child').focus()
[19:56:30] <Gsham> there is only one
[19:56:39] <Gsham> i did
[19:56:40] <acidjazz> ok well paste hte actual code
[19:59:51] <Gsham> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/QErkxL
[19:59:56] <Gsham> i got it working by adding time out
[20:00:12] <Gsham> cant work in code pen easily cant reload page
[20:00:22] <z1haze> anyone used backbonejs here? I have some questions about the templating
[20:00:32] <acidjazz> so you're doing the .focus() on pageload?
[20:00:36] <acidjazz> yea you need the input to at least render
[20:00:39] <acidjazz> before you can fire that
[20:00:52] <acidjazz> z1haze: im sure there are plenty of backbone channesl on irc/gitter/etc
[20:01:07] <Gsham> got it
[20:01:39] <z1haze> oh
[20:02:39] <z1haze> I just want to know when making a backbone js app do all of the templates for the whole application ahve to be in the index page or how does it work
[20:14:56] <Gsham> acidjazz still doesnt work on click...
[20:15:22] <Gsham> i have a button that i click and i want it to focus and it just wont work
[20:16:05] <Gsham> set time out has to be reaaaly long
[20:16:10] <Gsham> like 20 milliseconds lol
[20:16:58] <acidjazz> ok so you're doing a .focus on click
[20:17:06] <acidjazz> do you understand why its not working then?
[20:17:11] <acidjazz> you're triggering a focus yourself
[20:17:12] <acidjazz> on that button
[20:42:29] <bwsusa> hello all.
[20:45:23] <bwsusa> Looking for some assistance with a php form that uses jquery validator.  Would someone here be able to help or do i need to ask in another channel
[21:00:34] <bwsusa> I have a fairly simple php form i've inherited that uses jquery, and the jquery validation plugin.  I have 3 issues. 1) It will not submit without refreshing. no ajax submit 2) i get a 500 error from my send.php file 3) there is a JSON encode variable that i cannot track down.
[21:01:07] <bwsusa> anyone willing to give me a hand?
[21:05:46] <lerner> Hey, so I'm trying to figure out why console doesn't output "ok" when I hover over 'hi'. Any idea why? https://jsfiddle.net/fkz02fnx/1/
[21:07:51] <z1haze> because you ahve errors..
[21:08:30] <z1haze> you can't just shit out a bunch of html inside of javascript, it doesnt work like that
[21:09:55] <z1haze> https://jsfiddle.net/fkz02fnx/3/ lerner
[21:10:39] <lerner> z1haze: I see thanks
[21:24:07] <lerner> OK, similar problem, z1haze. In this scenario, the mouseover takes place in a popup. Why isn't it working? http://jsfiddle.net/HB7LU/4745/
[21:24:11] <lerner> this time no errors :P
[21:29:13] <lerner> sorry, this is the jsfiddle I meant to link to: http://jsfiddle.net/HB7LU/25349/
[21:39:04] <lerner> nevermind I figured it out
