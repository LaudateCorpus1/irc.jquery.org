[07:41:23] <Munt> Hey folks, Im currently trying to perform a form submit after a user selects an item from a select dropdown https://ghostbin.com/paste/f6sux    My code works however, I am wondering if there is a way to combine the two pieces of code from line 14 and also line 26
[07:42:18] <Munt> so that line 27 $("form#set-idle").submit();      not only triggers the submit on the form but also prevents defaults and submits the ajax post data
[07:50:29] <ExtraSteve> Munt: is there a reason it needs to be a form at all?
[07:50:51] <ExtraSteve> Why not get rid of the <form> and just have the <select> trigger an ajax call when it's change()d?
[07:51:22] <Munt> ExtraSteve  : That sounds much preferable.   I'll have to look into how to do that
[07:53:25] <Munt> Thanks ExtraSteve  :)
[07:54:17] <ExtraSteve> Munt: something like this perhaps: https://ghostbin.com/paste/5wb3m
[07:54:35] <ExtraSteve> Unless you've got a lot of fields that need to be accounted for, there's no real reason to have a <form>
[07:55:01] <ExtraSteve> Oh, and you'd get rid of the call to preventDefault() also
[07:55:06] <ExtraSteve> I accidentally left that in
[07:55:20] <Munt> That's great, thanks again ExtraSteve! Much appreciated :)
[07:55:27] <ExtraSteve> No problem
[07:55:31] <ExtraSteve> Hope it helps
[07:56:12] <Munt> Definitely does, easy when you know how :P
[07:57:02] <ExtraSteve> :)
[08:23:32] <Munt> I also have some forms that need submitting in a similar... is there are way to handle it more simply than I had originally tried at https://ghostbin.com/paste/f6sux with forms ?
[08:23:41] <Munt> in a similar fashion *
[08:29:20] <Cork> Munt: you can make it generic for both forms if the action is the same
[08:29:31] <Cork> other then that, no that is pretty close
[08:29:52] <Munt> Cork  : Thanks man.
[08:29:53] <Cork> Munt: one thing though, don't put tab names infront of id's
[08:30:12] <Cork> there is no point in asking the browser to look up all forms, and later match it with a unique id
[08:30:25] <Cork> just look up the unique id
[08:30:30] <Munt> Ahh cool thanks again :)
[08:43:38] <z1haze_work> whats up - not related to jquery particularly, more of a general dev question. I just got a request to work on a ticket thats like over a year old.. and it mentions disabling autocorrect for login fields.. does html allow you to do this, or is this still even relavant
[08:46:07] <Cork> z1haze_work: you might be talking about https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input#attr-autocorrect
[08:46:25] <Cork> but as far as i know it is an safari only thing
[08:50:33] <z1haze_work> hmm
[08:50:37] <z1haze_work> well that looks to be it
[08:50:40] <z1haze_work> guess ill put it in there
[08:56:22] <suexec> This is a gridstack question. Are the data-gs-x etc attributes optional?
[09:55:04] <KevinDF> Is it possible to loop through span elements in jquery and add text from an array? For example first span gets array[0] value, second span array[1],... so far I managed this: https://jsfiddle.net/y172yys6/ but i'm not sure how to get the first span element, second span element, ... in the for loop
[09:56:58] <AdamPDotty> aiaiai
[10:03:52] <AdamPDotty> https://jsfiddle.net/y172yys6/1/
[10:20:42] <KevinDF> AdamPDotty thanks, .eq did the trick
[10:26:33] <MikeD_> KevinDF: that's a very contrived example... what's the real world use case?
[10:38:29] <KevinDF> MikeD_ I'm practicing jQuery and working on a lottery system that generates 6 random numbers on button click and displays them on the screen in span elements, Nothing big really
[10:44:37] <MikeD_1> was thinking that "match enumerated span with array elements" is a bit weird
[10:46:19] <MikeD_1> some joker later adds .sortable() to your spans then you have no idea what they're rendering in each... but yeah, that's not the situation here
[11:34:44] <JonelethIrenicus> im having an issue where if I change the ids of tabs they are no longer changable.
[11:41:29] <MassDebates> are you dynamically reflecting the changed ids?
[11:41:41] <MassDebates> you must change your selector targets in order to keep up with the update.
[11:42:12] <MassDebates> the first time you run a script, if you change all #apples to #oranges, then the next time you try to run the script, you'll have no #apples to change to #oranges
[11:51:40] <taplar> 'all' #apples ?
[11:51:52] <taplar> :P
[11:53:15] <MassDebates> Sorry, each :P
[11:53:49] <taplar> or 'the'
[11:54:09] <MassDebates> ?
[11:54:20] <taplar> id man
[11:54:39] <MassDebates> Omg lmao
[11:54:44] <MassDebates> Well I hope he doesn't have multiple #apples
[11:54:46] <taplar> :)
[11:55:04] <MassDebates> You're right there though
[11:55:20] <MassDebates> the first time you run a script, if you change all .apples to .oranges, then the next time you try to run the script, you'll have no .apples to change to .oranges
[11:55:40] <MassDebates> Because who wants to type out #apples1 and #apples2 with #oranges1 and #oranges2
[11:56:25] <MassDebates> Damnit, your jedi mind tricks made me type it out!
[11:56:35] <taplar> yeah, nobody likes them apples
[11:57:06] <MassDebates> is that in comparison to oranges?
[11:57:55] <taplar> nah, movie pun
[12:07:26] <agdhruv> Hi!
[12:07:40] <taplar> hola
[12:08:09] <agdhruv> I am a complete newbie, wanting to contribute to jQuery. Please help me :)
[12:08:33] <taplar> if you go to the jquery website there is a contribute link up top
[12:08:41] <taplar> has some information in there you might find useful
[12:08:42] <agdhruv> There's so much of "how to start contributing" available online that I am confused where to start
[12:08:54] <taplar> otherwise try hitting up #jquery-dev
[12:08:55] <JonelethIrenicus> MassDebates: no i didn't, but how do i regen those?
[12:09:21] <agdhruv> Sorry, how do I "hit up" jquery-dev?
[12:09:26] <JonelethIrenicus> does a method not suggest?
[12:09:56] <taplar> ./join #jquery-dev without the '.'
[12:10:32] <agdhruv> Thank you @taplar
[12:19:42] <agdhruv_> join/ #jquery-dev
[12:46:32] <JonelethIrenicus> how can i re-assign my ids for tabs?
[12:48:05] <taplar_lunch> please explain your issue more
[12:52:01] * hlve slaps taplar_lunch with a trout.
[12:54:35] <z1haze_work> how do i fix this? http://dpaste.com/2XH52NT freakin cors stuff but its not even a different domain
[12:55:15] <JonelethIrenicus> taplar_lunch: i have changed the ids of some of my tab links and associated divs but when clicking the tabs it doesn't change the divs displayed like a normal jquery tab ui would
[12:55:45] <systemfault> z1haze_work: protocol matters bro.
[12:55:52] <z1haze_work> gah
[12:55:54] <taplar_lunch> JonelethIrenicus: can you make a fiddle showing the issue?
[12:56:39] <systemfault> z1haze_work: http/https mismatch (In case you have not seen it)
[12:56:57] <z1haze_work> yea i see it now that you said that
[12:56:59] <z1haze_work> thanks
[12:58:22] <z1haze_work> so systemfault, is there something i can put in the request so that it will work, or do they both have to be on the same protocol
[12:58:45] <taplar_lunch> just take off the http(s) and just have //
[12:58:57] <taplar_lunch> then it will be whatever the protocol of the page is
[13:02:17] <z1haze_work> how can we use javascript/jquery to catch html5 validation errors to apply an error class
[13:02:23] <z1haze_work> instead of using some validator plugin

[14:33:53] <peepoofoobar> hello, I am receiving a style tag as a part of HTML response. I want to scope the received style to the received HTML only. Any ideas on how it can be done?
[14:34:44] <peepoofoobar> actually the style is polluting entire page
[14:34:56] <taplar> ya you can't scope css
[14:35:04] <taplar> you have to make the rules only affect what you want it to affect
[14:35:47] <peepoofoobar> unfortunately that's not under my control
[14:35:56] <peepoofoobar> best is to nest styles
[14:36:16] <peepoofoobar> but I was wondering how to modify style object
[14:36:29] <taplar> there is no nesting of styles
[14:36:44] <taplar> every time you add styles to the page, it overrides matching existing styles
[14:37:00] <peepoofoobar> yes so I am thinking of prepending each rule with a specific id
[14:37:27] <taplar> sure, which would be my "you have to make the rules only affect what you want it to affect" statement
[14:37:44] <peepoofoobar> haha
[14:38:13] <peepoofoobar> how do I achieve that
[14:38:22] <taplar> ./join #css
[14:38:34] <taplar> without the '.'
[14:38:50] <peepoofoobar> oh I cannot modify styles as they are received from an external service
[14:39:10] <peepoofoobar> best bet is to modify it through JS
[14:39:22] <taplar> sure, you can do string manipulation
[14:40:03] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace for starters

[15:13:00] <toc> Hello, I have an example code that takes images only from a static flickr ? I have tried many other ways to change background, however no success. Could anybody explain it ?
[15:20:14] <carpii> i want to check if a div with overflow-y: auto, is currently scrolled to the absolute bottom. So when I add a new div, I can update the scroller. Im having difficulty getting this to work, any ideas please?
[15:24:51] <MassDebates> hi im back
[15:25:07] <MassDebates> some serious ribcage pain whenever i breathe
[15:31:41] <taplar> that's not good
[15:37:02] <elit3x> Can someone point me in the right direction. Not fluent with Jquery or JS ... I have a function that generates a HTML Table, one of the cells of that table is a button. I have a click listener for that button in the document on load, but it does not work.
[15:37:33] <elit3x> I am assuming its because the actuall button isnt present when the page first loads? What is the best practice to resolve this?
[15:39:09] <jose3__> elit3x:
[15:39:11] <jose3__> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10920355/attaching-click-event-to-a-jquery-object-not-yet-added-to-the-dom
[15:39:24] <jose3__> will this resolve your problem?
[15:40:00] <carpii> elit3x, use .on, not .click
[15:43:00] <elit3x> Ok Thank you jose3__ & carpii ; Thats what i needed!
[15:43:34] <carpii> when you use .on, you need to pass a parent element that WILL be present (and thats what the event handler is attached to).
[15:43:37] <carpii> good luck :)
[15:45:21] <elit3x> good to know, Thank you!
[15:45:52] <MassDebates> googling is not making me feel good. i scheduled with my doctor.
[15:46:01] <MikeD_> the name of this is "event delegation"
[15:46:04] <MassDebates> He says it's likely bruising but this is some killer bruise
[15:52:28] <carpii> might have damaged an intercostal muscle
[15:53:04] <carpii> i had a trapped nerve somewhere in that area, when i tried to heave a wooden filing cabinet up the stairs. was the most painful thing ever, for about 5 weeks
[16:00:46] <MassDebates> omg
[16:00:54] <MassDebates> i think thats it dude
[16:01:13] <MassDebates> im gonna bring a printout of this wikipedia page to im
[16:01:14] <MassDebates> himU*
[16:01:23] <nitrospectide> How can I trim this result to not include the space, plus the <span> and contents? http://jsbin.com/cinedejagi/edit?html,js,output
[16:02:29] <carpii> try with .html() instead of .text()
[16:04:00] <nitrospectide> carpii: that gives it to me with all of the markup. I get 'First Name <span class="form-required" title="This field is required.">*</span>'
[16:04:12] <nitrospectide> When I just want 'First Name'
[16:06:25] <carpii> gah jsbin is a piece of shit
[16:06:35] <carpii> jsfiddler is way better, for future :p
[16:06:46] <nitrospectide> carpii: feel free to transfer to jsfiddle
[16:15:50] <nitrospectide> carpii: Is it still giving you trouble?
[16:16:10] <carpii> im looking now
[16:16:20] <carpii> even jsfiddle has changed it seems
[16:20:47] <carpii> ive no idea what this is doing
[16:21:04] <carpii> even if i wrap the text in a span
[16:21:11] <carpii> var myLabel = $("label").first("span").text();
[16:21:14] <carpii> still returns the *
[16:22:41] <nitrospectide> carpii: Wouldn't that line you are showing grab *just* the span, and since it's .text(), render it as just the content of the span, which is the asterisk?
[16:23:00] <carpii> no this is after i wrapped a span around the label text
[16:37:13] <nitrospectide> carpii: I seem to have sorted it out: https://jsfiddle.net/7k8u1t8m/
[16:37:51] <carpii> i somehow saw you typing that on the other site
[16:37:58] <carpii> ust be some collab feature
[16:38:18] <carpii> very confusing :)
[16:38:38] <carpii> but yeah, thatd do it. i was trying to find a generic way to do it, so it doesnt matter what the contents of the * span are
[16:38:40] <carpii> but failed
[16:39:34] <nitrospectide> I'm sure there must be a way to remove a chunk wrapped in a tag - maybe before it collapses down into a string, but this will do for now. Thanks for working with me on it.
[16:41:03] <carpii> no probs, wish i knew why it was causing me so much trouble tho. bugging me now :)
[16:41:18] <carpii> some days you just think you know nothing
[16:42:03] <hlve> carpii, but we all know everything
[16:42:18] <carpii> until it comes to demonstrating it.. sure ;D
[16:42:22] <hlve> :P
[16:46:48] <nitrospectide> carpii: Isn't programming basically waves of feeling #clueless, alternating with waves of feeling #topOfTheWorld?
[16:47:02] <hlve> I AM AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD
[16:47:26] <carpii> i think thats manic depression, although it probably correlates with having to use endless stacks of tech
[16:49:01] <nitrospectide> carpii: Yeah. It resembles manic depression. But like you say, lots of moving parts = inexplicable fails. Either due to code changes or simple knowledge hiccups.
[16:50:27] <nitrospectide> Creatives go through that up and down too. C'est la vie
[16:50:49] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[16:50:51] <robertmaxrees> cyber monday
[16:51:55] <taplar> ah, wondered why you were out.  figured you took vaca

[16:53:05] <hlve> fml
[17:07:47] <robertmaxrees> awww my little node service is being a champ right now.
[17:08:02] <robertmaxrees> handling today's traffic like it's nothing.
[17:32:04] <robertmaxrees> taplar you guys do much for cyber monday?
[17:36:11] <taplar> i'm not aware of a big deal with it
[17:36:15] <taplar> we're more new years
[17:36:33] <robertmaxrees> iiinteresting.
[17:36:37] <robertmaxrees> just the demo?
[17:36:43] <carpii> ive never even heard of cyber monday until now
[17:36:50] <carpii> all these endless consumer sales get tiresome
[17:37:04] <robertmaxrees> sorry to hear.
[17:37:08] <robertmaxrees> it's a big day for my company.
[17:37:08] <taplar> demo?
[17:37:12] <robertmaxrees> demographic.
[17:37:18] <carpii> im UK, so maybe it hasnt quite reached here yet
[17:37:19] <taplar> ah
[17:37:26] <carpii> black friday is sitll in its infancy here too
[17:37:35] <robertmaxrees> carpii that's why - it's the web equivalent to black friday.
[17:37:37] <taplar> dunno.  i did see a twitter pic earlier that we put out, so i guess we are doing some stuff.
[17:37:44] <taplar> it's just we get WAY more traffic new years
[17:37:52] <carpii> web as in subscriptions and pay site discounts?
[17:38:02] <robertmaxrees> web as in ecommerce sites.
[17:38:18] <carpii> amazon UK are running cyber monday discounts it seems, but even their black firday offerings were a bit poor
[17:38:25] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[17:38:34] <robertmaxrees> probably not as big of a deal over on that side of the pond,.
[17:38:38] <carpii> heh yea
[17:41:58] <taplar> i needa get a new shaver.  think the battery on mine is crapping out
[17:42:08] <robertmaxrees> rockin' electric, eh?
[17:42:21] <taplar> yah, lazy like that, :)
[17:42:41] <taplar> for now i'm masking my fuzziness as novembeard
[17:42:43] <robertmaxrees> i went hipster a few years ago and started doing full DE.
[17:44:23] <taplar> heh, i feel switching to DE would be like going to manual shift.  and i just don't have the patience
[17:45:07] <taplar> i'd wind up like the joker in here
[17:45:31] <robertmaxrees> i've got weirdo sensitive skin but a super thick beard.  only thing i've found so far that does a good job.

[18:15:24] <Sayona> can you help me with this?
[18:15:30] <robertmaxrees> i just did.
[18:15:33] <robertmaxrees> add jquery.
[18:15:39] <robertmaxrees> problem solved!
[18:16:17] <Sayona> :(
[18:16:22] <robertmaxrees> what?
[18:17:47] <Sayona> nothing
[18:17:53] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[18:18:25] <Sayona> http://jsfiddle.net/mjaric/tfFLt/
[18:18:47] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[18:19:00] <taplar> shsss, no words
[18:19:14] <robertmaxrees> http://blog.survivalfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bearsafety2.jpg
[18:19:21] <robertmaxrees> (i have no idea what we're doing)

[18:19:40] <taplar> the bear that is
[18:21:35] <taplar> so some reason i want to include with that darth vader pic, the pic of the guy walking down the side walk dressed up as ash
[18:21:44] <robertmaxrees> sure why not
[18:22:25] <taplar> Sayona: use your words.  what is the problem?
[18:22:51] <Sayona> I try to create a form with 3 input text, and add a clone button and remove clone
[18:23:00] <Sayona> but I find something, now I try to reproduced
[18:23:05] <robertmaxrees> kay.
[18:24:18] <Sayona> I copy/paste this code http://jsfiddle.net/mjaric/tfFLt/ and give me error ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[18:24:28] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:24:33] <robertmaxrees> you need to include jquery
[18:24:35] <robertmaxrees> like i aleady said.
[18:24:36] <Sayona> javascript is on the footer in <script type='text/javascript'>
[18:24:37] <Sayona> aaa
[18:24:45] <Sayona> robertmaxrees, sorry
[18:24:46] <Sayona> pfff
[18:25:03] <Sayona> I drink :))
[18:25:30] <Sayona> My boyfriend opened a bottle of wine
[18:25:32] <robertmaxrees> ok
[18:25:55] * taplar gazes at all the duplicate ids
[18:26:27] <Sayona> ye! work
[18:26:45] <taplar> hmm?
[18:27:02] <Sayona> script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.min.js"></script>
[18:27:08] <Sayona> this is what I forggot
[18:27:17] <robertmaxrees> if you're in jsfiddle there's an easier way btw.
[18:28:13] <Sayona> but the script  http://jsfiddle.net/mjaric/tfFLt/ if I want I can remove all
[18:28:17] <Sayona> and is not ok
[18:28:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:28:27] <Sayona> how I modify to cannot remove the last?
[18:28:29] <robertmaxrees> you want to make sure there's at least one?
[18:28:33] <robertmaxrees> well, try it.
[18:28:33] <Sayona> yes
[18:28:38] <robertmaxrees> what do you think you'd do?
[18:29:02] <Sayona> no know!
[18:29:10] <robertmaxrees> so guess!
[18:29:23] <robertmaxrees> protip: you can use .length to get the number of elements that match a selector.
[18:29:24] <Sayona> if is 1 do nothing
[18:29:25] <robertmaxrees> could use that.
[18:29:30] <taplar> what is '1'?
[18:30:06] <Sayona> :(
[18:30:12] <taplar> if what is 1?
[18:31:18] <Sayona> if  lenght is 1
[18:31:39] <robertmaxrees> length of what?
[18:32:27] <Sayona> :(
[18:32:38] <robertmaxrees> we're not going to give you the answer.
[18:32:43] <robertmaxrees> we're here to help you learn.
[18:33:33] <Sayona> no know sorry
[18:33:41] <robertmaxrees> really?
[18:33:42] <Sayona> if the length of the id
[18:33:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah so IDs are unique.
[18:33:57] <Sayona> $(".ModuleInput").length;
[18:33:59] <robertmaxrees> you'll only ever have one on each page
[18:34:07] <robertmaxrees> classes can have multiples though :)
[18:35:12] <Sayona> :)
[18:47:16] <Sayona> robertmaxrees, taplar : http://jsfiddle.net/tfFLt/2251/ , I add a <form> and not work
[18:47:36] <robertmaxrees> what about it doesn't work?
[18:47:51] <Sayona> if i click clone ! is like refreshed
[18:48:16] <robertmaxrees> right because it's submitting the form probabkly.
[18:48:30] <Sayona> and how I fix that?
[18:48:35] <Sayona> can you help me please?
[18:48:42] <robertmaxrees> quick google search could tell you,.
[18:48:59] <robertmaxrees> protip: that might not be it. but that;'s my guess.
[18:49:24] <robertmaxrees> can try to use <button type="button" class="clone">Clone</button>
[18:49:36] <robertmaxrees> also: this won't work long term.
[18:49:42] <robertmaxrees> you'll be duplicating IDs.
[18:49:53] <Sayona> hmm
[18:49:55] <Sayona> uff
[18:50:02] <Sayona> and what is the best solution?
[18:50:15] <robertmaxrees> for what?
[18:50:34] <Sayona> for my
[18:50:36] <Sayona> to add button?
[18:50:48] <Null_> hey, I want to track json changes, is there any library which will keep the latest version of json, but then allow me to go backwards?
[18:50:50] <robertmaxrees> just showed you how.
[18:50:57] <Sayona> let me try
[18:51:07] <Null_> it'll be for something like a comment thread, which I want to keep records of
[18:51:50] <robertmaxrees> Null_ you just want a history on a comment thread?
[18:51:58] <Null_> yeah
[18:52:19] <robertmaxrees> what DB are you using?
[18:52:19] <Null_> i was thinking to start with json and keep changes, but I think would be better to keep current version of json and try to keep changes backwards
[18:52:30] <Sayona> yap not work...
[18:52:33] <Null_> i'm thinking mongodb, but its changable
[18:52:34] <Sayona> $_POST not submit
[18:52:44] <robertmaxrees> Sayona what?
[18:52:51] <Null_> i'm most interested in threads that get deleted/edited
[18:53:08] <robertmaxrees> Null_ ah, yeah, no real lib for that.  you store revisions of posts.
[18:53:20] <robertmaxrees> and never delete them, just mark them as active/inactive.
[18:53:50] <Null_> like, is there some easy way to diff json's and save the difference or is this niave on my part
[18:54:00] <robertmaxrees> the latter :)
[18:54:12] <robertmaxrees> there's no easy way to diff them.
[18:54:16] <robertmaxrees> well, that i can think of.
[18:54:20] <Sayona> robertmaxrees, now I need to find how to get all $_POST
[18:54:23] <Sayona> using like foreach..
[18:54:31] <robertmaxrees> Sayona huh?
[18:54:47] <robertmaxrees> "how to get all $_POST"?  you mean get the thing that was posted to your server?
[18:54:49] <Null_> ok thanks, didn't really help, but confirmed not a qick fix
[18:54:52] <Sayona> at $_POST submit, var_dump() i see only 1 record
[18:55:08] <Sayona> aaa
[18:55:12] <Sayona> it's work
[18:55:29] <robertmaxrees> Null_ errr, i just gave you a method to go with though.
[18:55:33] <robertmaxrees> you store revisions.
[18:55:46] <Sayona> thanks
[18:56:10] <Null_> this would be many copies of the post right?
[18:56:15] <Null_> er, thread of comments
[18:56:24] <robertmaxrees> of each comment.
[18:56:28] <robertmaxrees> not of the whole thread.
[18:56:59] <Null_> i'm looking for a whole thread version control, like comment delete options included, not just comments
[18:57:11] <Null_> er, not just text within comments.
[18:57:21] <robertmaxrees> right - so you'd store a revision of the comment that includes that it was deactivated.
[18:57:57] <Null_> ok, i see what you mean
[18:58:16] <robertmaxrees> if you want full history with the complete changeset at least.
[18:58:44] <Null_> what would be a quick algo of how i compare the latest thread with old
[18:58:54] <Null_> cause i don't get incremental info, i get the whole thread
[18:59:18] <Null_> like would i need to loop through every comment?
[18:59:23] <Null_> verse latest version and compare?
[18:59:38] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/flitbit/diff
[18:59:42] <robertmaxrees> something like this.
[19:00:57] <Null_> ok cool, i'll play around with that
[19:24:26] <bjsnider> i've got some jquery that works on jfiddle but not in a wordpress context, and i am using the noconflict code
[19:24:37] <robertmaxrees> does it throw any errors?
[19:24:53] <bjsnider> according to the head code, jquery is being loaded, which is why i wanted to use it
[19:24:58] <bjsnider> console has no errors
[19:25:26] <robertmaxrees> so then could you provide more detail?
[19:27:09] <bjsnider> robertmaxrees: i just wanted first to drop in a snippet that must work if jquery is really available. is there a snippet like that,  maybe something that just echoes text or something?
[19:27:41] <robertmaxrees> sure - console.log(window.$.fn.jquery);
[19:27:47] <robertmaxrees> if you get a number, you've got jquery.
[19:30:14] <bjsnider> that produces an error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'fn' of undefined(…)
[19:30:31] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[19:30:36] <robertmaxrees> no jquery.
[19:30:44] <bjsnider> i think that's because of noconflict mode
[19:30:48] <robertmaxrees> you could also try console.log(window.jQuery.fn.jquery);
[19:30:51] <robertmaxrees> see what that gets you.
[19:32:35] <bjsnider> no error, but i also don't see a number
[19:33:13] <bjsnider> can i echo some specific piece of text using jquery?
[19:34:18] <robertmaxrees> that's what that line will do.
[19:34:23] <robertmaxrees> it will echo the number.
[19:34:32] <robertmaxrees> but that means that block of code is never getting hit.
[19:35:34] <bjsnider> the jquery file being loaded has jquery-core,jquery-migrate,utils
[19:35:43] <bjsnider> jQuery v1.12.4
[19:35:56] <cannap> :D
[19:36:42] <bjsnider> i needed show, val, and change
[19:37:26] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[19:37:49] <robertmaxrees> both versions of .change() are just shortcuts.
[19:38:00] <robertmaxrees> val and show should both be in core last i checked.
[19:38:30] <cannap> val and  shoulkd  still in core
[19:38:43] <cannap> wow sry
[19:38:45] <robertmaxrees> haha
[19:39:26] <cannap> sry ;/
[19:42:57] <cannap> you use this stuff wrong
[19:43:17] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:43:17] <cannap> it should work
[19:43:26] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[19:43:28] <cannap> the guy who asked
[19:43:46] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider it sounds like maybe that code isn't even running.
[19:44:48] <bjsnider> it isn't running, but it spits out an error if the syntax is wrong?
[19:45:00] <bjsnider> strange kinda not running
[19:45:12] <robertmaxrees> that's totally expected.
[19:45:15] <robertmaxrees> can't parse it otherwise.
[19:45:16] <cannap> show the whole code
[19:45:52] <rx0s> hi there, im working on a sharepoint site using a jquery script and need some help customizing it
[19:45:59] <bjsnider> <script>
[19:46:01] <bjsnider> console.log(window.jQuery.fn.jquery);
[19:46:03] <bjsnider> </script>
[19:46:05] <robertmaxrees> nooo
[19:46:07] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:46:09] <cannap> awesome
[19:46:12] <cannap> thank you
[19:46:17] <robertmaxrees> you sure those script tags are getting included?
[19:47:36] <rx0s> https://jsfiddle.net/ebhmkuod/
[19:47:57] <robertmaxrees> rx0s what's your question?
[19:48:16] <rx0s> this script queries entries from a list and displays them in a dropdown menu, my client wants a permanent option called None as some documents might not apply to a particular person but to the organization itself
[19:49:21] <cannap> the first line is wrong <script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.1.min.js"></script>
[19:49:37] <cannap> jk
[19:49:38] <robertmaxrees> heh cannap they probably aren't worried abnout makiong a functioning fiddle.
[19:49:51] <cannap> i know
[19:49:54] <robertmaxrees> rx0s kind of hard to help without seeing a little more context.
[19:50:02] <cannap> but they need to learn
[19:50:21] <rx0s> For example, If I create organization Corp and add Joe and Michael, when I tag a document it asks for People: and when I click on the dropdown menu it gives me the 2 options Joe and Michael since they are the 2 entries
[19:50:34] <robertmaxrees> rx0s could you maybe flesh that example out more?
[19:50:36] <cannap> i dont see any html
[19:50:54] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:51:04] <robertmaxrees> cannap :) he may not know how to make an actual test case.
[19:51:29] <rx0s> cannap my first message said I am working on a sharepoint site using a jquery script
[19:51:41] <cannap> ok
[19:51:48] <robertmaxrees> rx0s yeah so your question assumes we know about the sharepoint frontend.
[19:51:55] <cannap> but in your fiddle i cant see any
[19:52:03] <robertmaxrees> hard for us to help when we can't see any html.
[19:52:10] <rx0s> I would assume that there would be a way to add a text when it queries for the list of names
[19:52:26] <cannap> check console it will thwor errors
[19:52:32] <robertmaxrees> cannap dude.
[19:52:32] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:52:43] <cannap> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <
[19:52:45] <robertmaxrees> slow down - he didn't make a fully functional example.
[19:52:50] <robertmaxrees> i think he's aware of that not :)
[19:53:07] <cannap> ok
[19:53:15] <rx0s> robertmaxrees: when it queries for the People list for example, is there a way to add a line to hard insert an entry there called none?
[19:53:23] <robertmaxrees> sure
[19:53:26] <robertmaxrees> that's easy.
[19:53:51] <robertmaxrees> i assume that all gets built out in call.done(function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) { ?
[19:53:57] <rx0s> so at its current state the script works fine, it checks the list People and displays the 2 options Joe and Michael, but they want a third option called None as the document wont apply to a particular person
[19:54:05] <cannap> you have wrong syntax in js
[19:54:51] <robertmaxrees> rx0s does that get built in that call.done() dealio?
[19:54:55] <rx0s> without the script it gives the option of None but since there are 2 entries on the People list I assume that the script pulls the 2 people and displays the 2 since the list is not Null
[19:55:12] <rx0s> robertmaxrees: thats where I am not sure, im a systems engineer, not much experience with jscript
[19:55:39] <robertmaxrees> rx0s heh kind of hard for us to help then - since we can't see what the api response is or how any of this really works....
[19:56:20] <rx0s> yea i figured, this is where i got the script from: http://www.markrackley.net/2014/05/20/cascading-drop-down-lists-in-sharepoint-office-365-using-rest/
[19:56:20] <robertmaxrees> why not have your backend reply with a "none" option instead?
[19:56:42] <robertmaxrees> ah that's why.
[19:57:17] <robertmaxrees> yeah my guess is that you'd add that in the call.done() callback
[19:58:56] <rx0s> right whats the syntax to add something?
[19:59:33] <robertmaxrees> you'd add it to that options string.
[19:59:37] <rx0s> I mean to add an entry before it displays the 2 results
[20:00:03] <robertmaxrees> wait what?  you just want to add an option taht is "none", right?
[20:00:06] <robertmaxrees> above the others?
[20:00:06] <rx0s> options += "<option value='"None"'>"+
[20:00:08] <rx0s> would that work?
[20:00:13] <rx0s> yes correct
[20:00:22] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you'd do it.
[20:00:39] <robertmaxrees> you're mixing quotes there.
[20:00:43] <robertmaxrees> but that's the basic idea.
[20:02:32] <rx0s> Cool thank you, I dont want to give it a try on my own as It will require me to upload the code to sharepoint and its a live site, they are currently using it
[20:02:45] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[20:02:53] <cannap> oO
[20:04:19] <rx0s> what I mean is, whats the line code that I need to add to make it work thats all
[20:04:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:04:34] <robertmaxrees> you basically started writing it...
[20:05:02] <rx0s> As I said, I have no jquery experience, I am not sure what I am doing
[20:05:11] <rx0s> So adding: options += "<option value='"+ None +"'>"+
[20:05:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:05:22] <robertmaxrees> don't even need that.
[20:05:26] <rx0s> before the other options function
[20:05:29] <robertmaxrees> and it's not jquery it's js.
[20:05:37] <rx0s> yea sure
[20:05:50] <robertmaxrees> it's a simple js string.
[20:06:20] <robertmaxrees> options += '<option value="None">None</option>';
[20:06:29] <rx0s> thank you
[20:06:34] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[20:06:43] * ExtraSteve shrugs
[20:06:49] <robertmaxrees> kind of confused but alright.
[20:06:58] <cannap> `{es6`
[20:07:10] <cannap> ,}ä
[20:07:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:07:21] <rx0s> You shouldnt assume people are programmers when they come here asking for help
[20:07:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:07:30] <rx0s> If i knew how to do it I would've done myself
[20:07:33] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[20:07:53] <rx0s> its the same as if you ask me how to configure a site to site vpn and I say well use your router
[20:08:08] <robertmaxrees> it's very reasonable to expect that you understand how to make a string in js.
[20:08:17] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:08:37] <robertmaxrees> and sure - you could safely assume i know the basics.
[20:08:47] <rx0s> I stated that I am a Systems Engineer not a programmer and I have no experience with JS, that was my statement
[20:08:52] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:08:54] <robertmaxrees> alright duder.
[20:09:02] <rx0s> but thats fine thanks for your time
[20:09:15] <rx0s> and help, i appreciate
[20:09:15] <robertmaxrees> doesn't preclude you from understanding the basics of a programming language (shrug).
[20:09:18] <robertmaxrees> glad we could help!
[20:09:57] <ExtraSteve> huh
[20:10:50] <bjsnider> i think it's thte change shortcut that isn't working
[20:11:12] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider are you trying to fire the change event or bind to a change event?
[20:11:34] <bjsnider> what's the difference?
[20:11:53] <ExtraSteve> firing = 'cause the change', binding = 'detect the change'
[20:12:01] <robertmaxrees> ^
[20:12:09] <ExtraSteve> (more or less)
[20:12:15] <robertmaxrees> are you doing $(someelement).change() or $(somelement).change(function() {});
[20:12:27] <bjsnider> i'm trying to bind to it
[20:12:43] <robertmaxrees> then use .on('change', function() {}); instead.
[20:13:09] <bjsnider> yes, i figured. is it possible their jquery script doesn't include the shortcut?
[20:13:33] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) oit
[20:13:37] <robertmaxrees> *it'd be weird.
[20:13:43] <robertmaxrees> buuut i've seen stranger.
[20:13:47] <robertmaxrees> though now i need to ask.
[20:13:56] <robertmaxrees> are you binding to an element that gets created after the page loads?
[20:14:12] <ExtraSteve> If so, use on()
[20:14:21] <cannap> this is not the same
[20:14:34] <robertmaxrees> ^ you'll use the delegated syntax of on, specifically.
[20:14:43] <robertmaxrees> cannap huh?
[20:14:57] <cannap> i mean on for events
[20:15:06] <robertmaxrees> how is that not the same??
[20:15:10] <ExtraSteve> .change(function() {}) only works for things that exist when the page loads
[20:15:26] <cannap> i dont know is use async xD
[20:15:29] <robertmaxrees> just like .on('change', function() {})l
[20:15:31] <robertmaxrees> cannap what??
[20:15:43] <robertmaxrees> cannap on / change aren't "async"
[20:15:52] <cannap> wait what
[20:15:59] <cannap> sry my miststake
[20:15:59] <bjsnider> some of the values get filled in with php during load
[20:16:01] <cannap> sorry
[20:16:24] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider "with php" - doesn't make sense heh.  are you using ajax or some js to make elements?
[20:16:34] <bjsnider> no
[20:16:44] <bjsnider> the elements are all hard-coded
[20:16:56] <robertmaxrees> okay - are you sure the elements exists?
[20:16:56] <cannap> oO
[20:16:57] <bjsnider> just the values get echoed by php out of a db
[20:17:01] <ExtraSteve> It's a php script that has <?php print 'stuff'; ?>, I'm assuming
[20:17:08] <ExtraSteve> Inside of a var = ''; in js
[20:17:12] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider what's the selector?
[20:17:27] <bjsnider> drop-box. select/option etc.
[20:17:34] <ExtraSteve> Like, var = '<?php echo $val; ?>'; - right?
[20:17:35] <robertmaxrees> right so what's the selector?
[20:17:39] <robertmaxrees> the part that you call with $()
[20:18:07] <cannap> are do this via    jwrt?
[20:18:14] <cannap> you
[20:18:21] <bjsnider> well, you don;t need to put it in a var, you can actually just run the code right in the middle of the html
[20:18:23] <cannap> jwt
[20:18:29] <cannap> fuckmy ne keyboard
[20:18:53] <bjsnider> cannap: it's the poor musican who blames his instrument
[20:19:54] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider so what's the actuals js that happens here?
[20:20:48] <bjsnider> the idea is just, display something if an option is selected
[20:20:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:21:09] <robertmaxrees> i'm wondering if you're, like, selecting multiple things with the same ID or something.
[20:21:15] <robertmaxrees> i need more to go on at this point.
[20:22:00] <bjsnider> well, first i'm going to try wihtout the change shortcut
[20:22:10] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[20:22:55] <cannap> this is always the jquery channel but you need a server check anyway
[20:23:05] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:23:13] <cannap> :D
[20:27:41] <cannap> i dont know much beer good night
[20:35:50] <bjsnider> no, change doesn't work at all
[20:36:02] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[20:36:12] <robertmaxrees> and your js is after the the html / in a doucment ready?
[20:36:21] <robertmaxrees> and you're not like repeating IDs or anything on the apge?
[20:36:22] <robertmaxrees> *page
[20:37:41] <bjsnider> yes, and yes
[20:37:56] <bjsnider> what does the change function look like in the jquery file?
[20:40:41] <robertmaxrees> put it earlier :)
[20:40:49] <robertmaxrees> $('selector').on('change', function() {});
[20:43:36] <bjsnider> put the script earlier?
[20:43:46] <robertmaxrees> later.
[20:44:01] <robertmaxrees> script should always be after your html or use a document ready.
[20:44:36] <robertmaxrees> also did you mention something about some noconflict use here?
[20:46:38] <bjsnider> yes, basically it means replacing the dollar with jQuery
[20:46:39] <bjsnider> as i understand it
[20:46:39] <bjsnider> anyway, it works fine on fiddle
[20:46:49] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[20:46:59] <robertmaxrees> how are you using the noconflict?
[20:48:05] <bjsnider> basically everything the same excepot the dollars are replaced with 'jQuery'
[20:48:13] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i meant lol
[20:48:22] <robertmaxrees> can you show me the line where you set the noconflict?
[20:50:25] <bjsnider> set? i don't know what that means
[20:50:49] <robertmaxrees> there's a particular line of code you're using to set noConflict.
[20:51:53] <robertmaxrees> sorry - without seeing a functioning test case at this point, i'm kind of grasping at straws.
[20:52:06] <robertmaxrees> also, fixingthesejquery.com is a great tutorial for getting started on debugging.
[20:53:11] <bjsnider> i didn't set noconflict, it's a wordpress policy
[20:53:25] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so it's the default wp setting.
[20:53:26] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[20:53:30] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see the code.
[20:55:54] <bjsnider> i can construct a very simplified version with just a few lines, but what difference would it make given that the full version and all such derivatives works on fiddle?
[20:56:22] <robertmaxrees> i could find common failure points.
[20:56:53] <robertmaxrees> the last thing i could suggest is to do a delegated listener for that particular change and see if that works.
[20:58:07] <bjsnider> well, i'll strip it down to a small version and sve a fiddle version so you can check it out
[20:58:16] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[20:58:27] <robertmaxrees> (thought you already had a test case)
[20:58:51] <robertmaxrees> $(document).on('change', 'yourElementHere', function() {});
[20:58:53] <robertmaxrees> fwiw.
[21:02:05] <bjsnider> i do but it's so big it would take too long to figure it out
[21:02:14] <bjsnider> quicker if i just strip it down to the bare essentials
[21:16:15] <bjsnider> robertmaxrees: this doesn't work but i think you can see what i'm getting at: https://jsfiddle.net/x3qv9hr6/
[21:17:23] <robertmaxrees> so coupla things here.
[21:18:42] <robertmaxrees> first off, you want the value of the select - you can just do $(this).val() there.
[21:18:46] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/x3qv9hr6/6/
[21:18:53] <robertmaxrees> keep it simple.
[21:21:43] <bjsnider> removeclass hide, that's a nice touch
[21:21:59] <robertmaxrees> explicit not implicit in that case.
[21:23:22] <bjsnider> what if i have a series of fields for each option, and i want only one set to appear as per the selection? right now the working version just keeps the previously selected fields visible when a new selection is made
[21:23:38] <bjsnider> if you take my meaning
[21:23:40] <robertmaxrees> could you update the fiddle.
[21:24:00] <robertmaxrees> and show me the html?
[21:26:52] <bjsnider> https://jsfiddle.net/x3qv9hr6/7/
[21:27:21] <bjsnider> you see how if you make another selection fromt eh box the previous selection stays visible
[21:28:32] <robertmaxrees> coupla ways.
[21:29:58] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/x3qv9hr6/9/
[21:30:02] <robertmaxrees> this is your best bet for that.
[21:32:41] <bjsnider> robertmaxrees: thanks. it looks great, in that context
[21:33:42] <bjsnider> robertmaxrees: can the ('.row').addClass code be a list of row classes, eg. '.row', '.row2' and so on?
[21:34:02] <bjsnider> or would that require new lines?
[21:34:03] <robertmaxrees> why would you do that?
[21:34:14] <robertmaxrees> yes, you can target multiple elements, but that seems odd.
[21:34:39] <bjsnider> they currently have different names
[21:34:54] <robertmaxrees> so ideally they wouldn't.
[21:34:56] <bjsnider> that was my first strategy to control them. i can give them all the same name
[21:35:15] <robertmaxrees> well, they should share a class and then have some kind of other identifier.
[21:55:24] * taplar wonders how active robertmaxrees's coffee pots are going
[21:55:36] <robertmaxrees> fun fact: we don't have traditional coffee pots.
[21:55:43] <robertmaxrees> we have machines that grind and brew on spot.
[21:55:44] <taplar> oh?
[21:55:51] <robertmaxrees> pres butan -> get coffee
[21:55:54] * taplar drools
[21:56:38] <robertmaxrees> also; there's a place across the street run by mennonites.  the dad of the family roasts his own beans.  last i checked we were getting our beans from him.
[21:56:39] <taplar> best we have is our bistro has those little machines that takes to cups and makes you a cappachino
[21:57:39] <robertmaxrees> very nice.
[22:17:02] <bjsnider> works perfectly in fiddle, doesn't work in wp
[22:17:21] <robertmaxrees> right before that event binding, put in this: console.log('foo');
[22:17:29] <robertmaxrees> does that print to the console?
[22:18:14] <bjsnider> yes it does
[22:18:56] <robertmaxrees> how about console.log(jQuery("[id='box']").length);
[22:19:31] <bjsnider> that echoes 0
[22:19:37] <robertmaxrees> there's your issue.
[22:19:45] <robertmaxrees> that element doesn't exist at the time of binding.
[22:19:51] <robertmaxrees> go to your console and put that in.
[22:20:00] <bjsnider> i changed hte name
[22:20:05] <bjsnider> let me try with the atual name
[22:20:08] <robertmaxrees> the ID, you mean?
[22:20:13] <robertmaxrees> because name != id.
[22:20:47] <bjsnider> the id. the result this time is 2
[22:20:52] <robertmaxrees> that's a problem.
[22:20:57] <robertmaxrees> and would cause your headaches
[22:21:33] <bjsnider> that means the string is 2 characters?
[22:21:57] <robertmaxrees> that means there are two elements with that ID.
[22:22:00] <robertmaxrees> which is invalid.
[22:22:22] <bjsnider> the other one is a p
[22:22:29] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid.
[22:22:37] <taplar> it's a unique id(entifier)
[22:22:39] <robertmaxrees> tagname isn't taken into account.
[22:22:55] <bjsnider> i know it's invalid in html, but change can't be applied to paragraphs
[22:23:06] <robertmaxrees> then you're sol.
[22:23:10] <robertmaxrees> unless you change the ID on the div.
[22:23:17] <robertmaxrees> because you cannot repeat an ID on a page.
[22:23:20] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid.
[22:26:16] <taplar> i wonder how many people are self taught and how many didn't have a teacher that beat them over the head on day one that ids are unique
[22:26:29] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[22:26:38] <taplar> comes up a lot
[22:26:50] <bjsnider> switched the id, length now 1, still doesn't work, but does in fiddle
[22:27:05] <robertmaxrees> did you update the JS to point to the correct ID?
[22:27:13] <robertmaxrees> and did you try thatselector in the console?
[22:28:56] <bjsnider> i did, but there was a typo
[22:29:04] <robertmaxrees> so you fixed it now?
[22:31:37] <bjsnider> it works, but it also blanks out another drop-box, that's because i have to change the row classes
[22:31:52] <robertmaxrees> you can also make it relative to the current element.
[22:32:09] <bjsnider> i want to reuse the code somewhere else
[22:32:19] <robertmaxrees> right.
[22:32:26] <robertmaxrees> which is why you often make it relative to the current element.
[22:32:39] <bjsnider> i'm correct in assuming the jquery will be more compatible with browsers and devices than pure javascript?
[22:32:48] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[22:32:57] <robertmaxrees> kind of depends on what you mean by "more compatibile"
[22:33:41] <bjsnider> well, that's why i originally wanted to use it, because i was worried about some old fart using a browser from the 1990s
[22:33:56] <robertmaxrees> also depends on the version of jquery you're using.
[22:34:07] <bjsnider> i figured if you load the functions the browser has to use them no matter what
[22:34:22] <robertmaxrees> also also you can still use some basic JS that will break those browsers.
[22:34:25] <bjsnider> unless js is just turned off
[22:34:36] <robertmaxrees> so it really depends on how far you want to take all of that.
[22:34:48] <robertmaxrees> but it's more complex than just "use jq, works for everybody"
[22:34:50] <bjsnider> how do i ake it relative?
[22:35:01] <robertmaxrees> heh link to the fiddle?
[22:35:57] <robertmaxrees> and did you read anything i said about your question?
[22:36:47] <bjsnider> which question?
[22:36:55] <robertmaxrees> "i'm correct in assuming the jquery will be more compatible with browsers and devices than pure javascript?"
[22:37:20] <bjsnider> i'm asking how do i make this script relative to the current element
[22:37:25] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[22:37:34] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[22:37:50] <robertmaxrees> dunno why we're skipping over your other question entirely, but link to the fiddle again.
[22:38:08] <bjsnider> because you already established that it was an impossible question to answer
[22:38:17] <robertmaxrees> i didn't,.
[22:38:18] <robertmaxrees> but ok.
[22:38:41] <bjsnider> can you just use your last save?
[22:38:49] <robertmaxrees> sure - can you link it again?
[22:38:53] <robertmaxrees> i don't have it handle.
[22:38:55] <robertmaxrees> *handy
[22:39:03] <bjsnider> ok
[22:39:35] <bjsnider> https://jsfiddle.net/x3qv9hr6/9/
[22:40:03] <robertmaxrees> so would there happen to be an element that wraps both this tablet and its accompanying select?  if not, can there be?
[22:40:12] <robertmaxrees> *table
[22:40:36] <taplar> side note, if you pass in $ on the doc ready you can use it inside
[22:40:45] <robertmaxrees> was just making that change :)
[22:42:19] <bjsnider> no, this won't work
[22:42:26] <robertmaxrees> what?
[22:43:00] <bjsnider> the containing element has both tables and both drop-boxes and i have no control over that
[22:43:14] <robertmaxrees> right - can you add another element?
[22:43:53] <bjsnider> around the box and the script, but not the table
[22:44:02] <robertmaxrees> you can't include the table in it?
[22:44:06] <bjsnider> no
[22:44:08] <robertmaxrees> welp.
[22:44:20] <robertmaxrees> you can use siblings.
[22:44:31] <bjsnider> but anyway, the problem is that i was using the same row class names over and over. that's the right way to fix it
[22:44:48] <robertmaxrees> actually it's not but OK.
[22:45:07] <bjsnider> it's adding the hide for that reason
[22:45:21] <robertmaxrees> sure - still not the right way.
[22:45:26] <robertmaxrees> you want to make it relative to the slect.
[22:45:36] <robertmaxrees> you can do that without the wrapping element.
[22:45:39] <robertmaxrees> just a little funky without.
[22:45:43] <bjsnider> what do you mean i can use siblings?
[22:45:59] <robertmaxrees> jquery can traverse the document and find siblings and things.
[22:46:04] <taplar> next('table') if you can't wrap them
[22:46:14] <robertmaxrees> can just use .next() fwiw.
[22:47:10] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/x3qv9hr6/16/
[22:47:15] <taplar> sure.  are there going to be multiple of these pairings?  *me came in late*
[22:47:16] <bjsnider> it would find the next table and dump it into the div?
[22:47:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[22:47:30] <robertmaxrees> no.
[22:47:35] <robertmaxrees> look at the fiddle.
[22:47:45] <taplar> nvm, rob changed it to a class
[22:47:48] <taplar> :D
[22:47:55] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[22:50:21] <bjsnider> i see. you're limiting the scope to the next table
[22:53:27] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[23:57:39] <_August_> whats the correct way to do an or operator using a if not has class in my if statement i have this if (!$('.due-accounts').hasClass('btn-primary') || !$('.new-accounts').hasClass('btn-primary')) {
[23:58:01] <_August_> it looks correct but its simply not working
