[03:13:39] <itsgokul> where can i find a good event based calendar in jquery
[03:38:09] <Shai-Tan> good morning campers
[03:38:47] <Shai-Tan> I have a <select id="foo"> and wish to change the selected option. I can change the value, but how to change the option?
[03:50:26] <abb4s> hi every body . i want on click activation with superfish menu i found this but it not work for me  : http://osdir.com/ml/jQuery/2009-03/msg02823.html
[03:50:35] <abb4s> can you help me !?
[05:09:53] <rindolf> Hi all.
[05:20:02] <hellyeah> hey i have an element which has several css class
[05:20:13] <hellyeah> i want to find one spesific class begins with s for example
[05:20:26] <hellyeah> is there a way to find a class with a letter?
[07:29:01] <Shai-Tan> I have a <select id="foo"> and wish to change the selected option. I can change the value, but how to change the option?
[07:30:27] <shoky> Shai-Tan: changing the value of the select will select the option that has that value
[07:31:21] <Shai-Tan> shoky, well, I do $('#territoryAccounts').val('0'); and it changes the value, but the option name is still the same
[07:32:17] <shoky> oh you want to change the option itself?  then  .find(':selected').val('0')    or .text('0')  if you want to change its text
[07:33:05] <Shai-Tan> I have 4 options, and want it to return toi <option value="0">Select Territory</option>
[07:33:32] <shoky> then  .val('0') should work
[07:33:46] <yd4b> with jquery i call a php file with .get in this php file i select data form a mysql database(for ex. column animalname row "cat") and echo it, then in the jquery i catch this data and append it to a div. this works. But then if i on the same page call the jquery get again and i have deleted the cat row and added 1 row with tiger then in the div i get a second "cat" appended why is this so
[07:34:36] <shoky> Shai-Tan: donno what you mean by "but the option name is still the same"
[07:35:29] <shoky> anyways, make a minimal jsfiddle if there's still a problem
[07:39:41] <Shai-Tan> aha! $("#territory_id option:selected").removeAttr("selected");
[07:39:44] <Shai-Tan> nailed it
[07:57:17] <hellyeah> hey i have three functions i use delegate in three lines
[07:57:53] <hellyeah> can i call it like $('body').on('#new', 'click',a,b,c)
[08:55:39] <murosai_> how can i get data from promise object?
[08:57:02] <GrundeLL_> Ive been trying to get a ui slider to work with predetermined values that i have, such as array(10, 30 , 80, 140 )etc etc but cant figure how to get it to work, does anyone know how i can set predetermined values for ui slider?
[09:32:09] <tinyhippo> if I do https://p.tinyhip.pw/view/e4c54a5f I get one element, but if I do https://p.tinyhip.pw/view/fcf71dbf it appends to two elements, what am I doing wrong?
[10:38:12] <GrundeLL> Hello im trying to create something like this for jqueryUi slider, is that possible? http://refreshless.com/nouislider/examples/#section-huge-numbers
[10:39:08] <taplar> you got a link there that is doing it.  answers your 'is it possible' question, no?
[10:47:13] <GrundeLL> taplar: well for the jqueryUi slider not that one.
[10:47:49] <GrundeLL> taplar: since i have used the jqueryUI for all of it i want to be able to add it to my ui slider
[10:48:49] <taplar> you might try: http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#option-values
[10:55:50] <GrundeLL> taplar: yeah been trying that, but cant seam to get it to work... :/
[10:57:38] <GrundeLL> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/EHLQL/94/
[10:57:43] <GrundeLL> Something like that happens instaed
[10:58:20] <taplar> interesting, that's funky, :)
[10:59:41] <GrundeLL> taplar: exactly, so i thaught there might be a way to get the values to actually be "values"...
[10:59:59] <GrundeLL> taplar: so thats why i asked if its possible on jqueryUI slider ;)
[11:00:30] <decx> what's supposed to happen?
[11:01:20] <GrundeLL> decx: I want the values to be actual slider values (or rather "steps")
[11:02:01] <decx> so you want to get it back as an array
[11:02:04] <decx> ?!
[11:02:25] <taplar> he's trying to limit the slider values to those values
[11:02:44] <decx> wat
[11:03:05] <taplar> function like a normal slide, but jump between those values when you slide
[11:03:09] <taplar> as i understand it
[11:04:06] <GrundeLL> taplar: correct
[11:04:09] <decx> like the step property?
[11:04:16] <GrundeLL> yep
[11:04:18] <taplar> but they are not uniform
[11:04:51] <decx> maybe send a new step value option every time you reach a threshold
[11:06:15] <GrundeLL> decx: so update the step each event?
[11:06:33] <decx> no judgement in idea time!
[11:06:35] <decx> ^^
[11:06:41] <decx> yeah something liek that
[11:06:42] <taplar> maybe on 'stop'
[11:06:48] <taplar> move to the closest value
[11:06:59] <decx> that's better yes
[11:07:59] <GrundeLL> taplar: okay, that could maybe work, im not to familiar with it, how do i go about that?
[11:08:10] <taplar> http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#event-stop
[11:08:18] <decx> reduce to get the closest number from your array
[11:08:41] <decx> the values you need should be in the ui argument
[11:11:49] <GrundeLL> Okay and how i assign the closes value from my array to the slider... ?
[11:12:06] <taplar> math brah
[11:12:32] <taplar> who knew you'd need it later in life, ;)
[11:13:02] <GrundeLL> taplar: that i understand but the actual function :D ?
[11:13:16] <GrundeLL> https://jsfiddle.net/EHLQL/95/ - assume it should be something like that
[11:13:33] <GrundeLL> But what should i do with it :D ?
[11:13:50] <GrundeLL> Im sorry in not the most advanced jQuery coder...
[11:13:59] <GrundeLL> Guess thats why im here
[11:14:28] <taplar> ok, so if you inspect the ui, it has a .value on it
[11:15:00] <taplar> by inspect i just did a console log of it
[11:15:19] <GrundeLL> yeah that i know
[11:15:28] <taplar> ok, so what's confusing you?
[11:17:25] <GrundeLL> taplar: right so how to i assign the closes value in my array (assume i need to create an array of values) and then get the value of my slider and "assign" the closes value in that array as the valye
[11:17:41] <GrundeLL> So simply the actual code that is going to handle the "steps" for me on stop
[11:18:00] <taplar> you'll need to go through your array and find the difference between the value you have and the available values
[11:18:10] <taplar> minimum difference would be the closest value
[11:18:18] <taplar> then you know what it should be set as
[11:18:45] <GrundeLL> Right exactly and here is where my limitations come in, how do i go about this ?
[11:19:16] <taplar> so first work on looping through the array and finding the differences
[11:19:37] <taplar> Arrays.prototype.each or $.each() will do it for you
[11:20:46] <GrundeLL> taplar: ok
[11:21:40] <GrundeLL> From ther?
[11:22:01] <taplar> so now work on finding the smallest value from those
[11:22:17] <taplar> hint, you'll probably want to use Math.abs()
[11:24:27] <GrundeLL> taplar: yeah was just going to say i want to use Math
[11:25:48] <GrundeLL> taplar: though if i want to find smallest value don't i want to do Math.min()?
[11:26:04] <decx> you use reduce not each to find the closest thing
[11:26:37] <taplar> i'm not familiar with reduce so decx might point you to something simpler
[11:26:49] <decx> taplar: you're gonna love it
[11:26:58] <decx> no stray vars
[11:27:10] <decx> start https://jsfiddle.net/decx/EHLQL/97/
[11:27:13] <taplar> and you can keep context with the original value?
[11:27:32] <taplar> wait
[11:27:34] <taplar> lol
[11:27:48] <taplar> if you have the minimum difference, you have the 'adjustment' you need to make, :s
[11:28:06] <decx> right that's why i return it
[11:28:12] <GrundeLL> still values doesn't work the way we want it to
[11:28:46] <GrundeLL> i don't think we can pull values: values.slice(), on line 12
[11:29:16] <decx> it's a direct reference which ui will overwrite with the new values you move the handles to
[11:29:20] <decx> so you do need slice
[11:29:27] <taplar> this is what i came up with fwiw, without the reduce, https://jsfiddle.net/EHLQL/98/
[11:30:20] <GrundeLL> taplar: that one works a lot better :D
[11:30:33] <taplar> i'm gonna tinker with the reduce too
[11:31:30] <GrundeLL> taplar: okay, reading through the code atm trying to understand it :D
[11:34:58] <taplar> yeah, reduce is better
[11:34:59] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/EHLQL/99/
[11:35:34] <decx> taplar: more reduce irrelevant reduce fun https://jsfiddle.net/decx/sxoygt60/
[11:35:43] <decx> i should reduce the reduce in my sentences
[11:36:12] <geri> hi decx
[11:36:13] <GrundeLL> taplar: so what is the reduce doing ?
[11:36:14] <taplar> cool
[11:36:31] <decx> reduce folds an array
[11:36:41] <decx> so you can have a persistent thing you check against
[11:37:19] <decx> [1,2].reduce(function(a,b){ a + b },0) returns 3 for example
[11:37:37] <decx> the first a would be the what's after the comma
[11:37:40] <decx> and it can be anything
[11:38:04] <decx> so it goes a + 1
[11:38:13] <decx> first a is 0
[11:38:23] <decx> so 0 +1, then a is 1 because you returned it
[11:38:28] <decx> so 1 +2
[11:38:31] <GrundeLL> ah okay
[11:38:33] <GrundeLL> cool
[11:39:06] <decx> arguments are a,b,i,g so a for anythign you start with and return
[11:39:14] <decx> b is the current element being run againts
[11:39:20] <decx> i is the index as you know it
[11:39:29] <decx> and g is the whole array you check against
[11:39:40] <GrundeLL> Oh okay
[11:39:47] <decx> well that's what i call them
[11:39:56] <decx> you can call them dick for all i care ^^
[11:42:08] <GrundeLL> So in taplars latest version stio version looks at slider values and look at the values closest to SliderArray by looking at previous / current and from there it updates the slider value to current value on line 28
[11:42:15] <GrundeLL> Is that correct?
[11:43:05] <taplar> pretty much
[11:43:23] <taplar> previousValue is a running state of the closest value at that point
[11:43:29] <GrundeLL> cool
[11:43:45] <taplar> the reduce returns the smallest difference value every time
[11:43:55] <taplar> so at the end, it's the very smallest difference value
[11:44:13] <GrundeLL> Ah okay
[11:44:35] <treehau5> is there a way to get the performance metrics of a particular selector?
[11:44:51] <GrundeLL> ah nice
[11:45:17] <GrundeLL> I really like the simplicity of it with the reduce
[11:45:27] <taplar> treehau5: iirc the developer tools have timing tools you can use
[11:45:39] <taplar> just have to turn them on and then refresh the page or perform an action
[11:45:56] <taplar> what's your selector?
[11:46:03] <taplar> and are you seeing performance issues?
[11:46:05] <treehau5> taplar: i was more looking for possibly giving me insight to the internal jquery queues as well
[11:47:08] <taplar> GrundeLL: ya, less boilerplate
[11:47:37] <GrundeLL> taplar: decx: thank you so much for the help oon this one :D i actually do underrstand a little more of it now
[11:48:34] <treehau5> taplar: i am using .find('[name="loginEmai;"]') to get a form field from a modal. The performance of it actually is pretty good, It just isn't blazing fast, because my variable is undefined when I attempt to use it in the next statement. It just piqued my interest to see if there was some plugin written that gives you stats on a particular selector
[11:48:34] <treehau5> .
[11:48:59] <taplar> you should use a class or an id instead
[11:49:06] <taplar> or find on a parent element before doing that
[11:49:24] <taplar> attribute selectors are not good performance wise.
[11:50:04] <taplar> attributes can be pretty much on any dom element, so it has to search every dom element.  So changing it to not do that, or reducing the scope it has to operate over, is benificial
[11:50:45] <treehau5> that makes sense. I am limiting the scope
[11:55:07] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
[11:55:16] <taplar> kabang!
[11:56:42] <decx> the basic guideline is: kill them all and let god sort them out... i mean... cache and filter ^^
[11:56:54] <taplar> heh
[11:57:21] <taplar> and don't try to stuff everything into the selector, :)
[11:58:13] <treehau5> what would you say the threshold is, to assume syncronicity
[11:58:24] <taplar> huh?
[11:58:47] <treehau5> the thing I worry about is I am basically always relying on the fact that the jquery function call is fast enough to return so that the next line of my code can use it
[11:59:02] <taplar> it's synchronous
[11:59:19] <taplar> unless your doing this in some sort of asynchronous callback
[11:59:37] <treehau5> var a = $(element).find(some-field).val()
[11:59:37] <taplar> but even then, within the callback, it's synchronous
[11:59:46] <treehau5> next line: doSomethingWith(a)
[11:59:53] <treehau5> if the selector is slow, a will be undefined
[11:59:59] <decx> doesnt matter
[12:00:03] <decx> one line after the other
[12:00:04] <taplar> it's synchronous dude
[12:01:22] <decx> imagine having callbacks for selectors haha
[12:01:26] <decx> that so js ^^
[12:01:55] <taplar> it's the new stuff with js stuff doing something with the dom access to make it more asynchronous
[12:02:00] <taplar> it's = isn't
[12:02:13] <taplar> or maybe i dreamed hearing someone say that
[12:02:50] <treehau5> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/fw4yafgm/
[12:03:04] <treehau5> the browser is not syncronous, ever.
[12:03:12] <taplar> your not returning anything
[12:03:38] <taplar> your confusing scope
[12:03:43] <treehau5> 1 sec
[12:04:39] <treehau5> what what do you mean its the new stuff with js stuff doing something
[12:05:05] <taplar> ignore that.  just me trying to remember some thing i thought i heard
[12:05:17] <taplar> which is more to do with future js versions not yet out
[12:05:24] <treehau5> oh i hate jsfiddle
[12:05:27] <treehau5> oh ok
[12:06:11] <decx> stop with alert
[12:08:28] <taplar> the main point about the issue in your fiddle is that the logic inside the setTimeout does not have any where to return to
[12:08:35] <treehau5> it was a typo
[12:08:58] <treehau5> my main thing i was trying to demonstrate is aynchronous nature of javascript in the browser
[12:09:09] <decx> no
[12:09:11] <decx> just no
[12:09:22] <treehau5> ok, please enlighten me
[12:09:34] <decx> when you call find you dont get a return until its done
[12:09:55] <decx> and only after the return will js look at the next thing
[12:10:14] <taplar> js isn't by default async.  and jquery is js
[12:10:30] <treehau5> ok that makes sense
[12:10:53] <treehau5> i was only lead to believe this because I had a slow selector, and I was relying on this return value in the next statement, in which it was undefined
[12:11:04] <treehau5> when I changed the selector to use an id, it worked as expected
[12:11:12] <bango2> can jquery handle delegation of load() functions?
[12:11:22] <taplar> load doesn't propagate out, iirc
[12:11:27] <bango2> ok ty
[12:19:08] <GeorgesLeYeti> Hi
[12:19:17] <taplar> aloha
[12:19:18] <awkwardCough> hello
[12:19:32] <taplar> ^ virus spreader
[12:19:56] <GeorgesLeYeti> Is it possible to pass an array as params into the url. I'm using widnow.location.href = ....
[12:20:13] <taplar> you'll want to url encode it
[12:20:33] <taplar> but an array?
[12:21:00] <decx> blah = [1,2,3,4,5] becomes blah[]=1&blah[]=2...
[12:21:28] <taplar> ah, but wouldn't that need to be an object on the outer?
[12:21:39] <decx> doesnt matter
[12:21:40] <taplar> so the key is there
[12:22:13] <decx> you probably get the key in there in other ways too, but yes that makes it easy
[12:22:24] <decx> { blah: [] }
[12:24:26] <GeorgesLeYeti> decx, do you if  blah[]=1&blah[]=2 is interpreted as blah=[1,2] but my controller ? (I'm using ruby on rails)
[12:25:04] <decx> that's juts how an array is encoded for an url no idea about ruby
[12:27:07] <GeorgesLeYeti> decx, ok ty a lot
[12:29:14] <GeorgesLeYeti> decx, Is there any method/funtion to convert an array directly into this kind of string or did i have to make a function for that?
[12:32:44] <bango2> do load functions need to be defined before its relevant iframe in the dom?
[12:32:51] <bango2> their*
[12:33:19] <taplar_lunch> bango2: not if your attaching the event to the element with js
[12:33:25] <taplar_lunch> which you should do
[12:33:32] <taplar_lunch> instead of inline bindings
[12:33:34] <bango2> so onload=""
[12:33:41] <taplar_lunch> no, bind with js
[12:34:04] <bango2> sorry can you elaborate i dont understand
[12:34:05] <taplar_lunch> $(iframeSelector).on('load', function... )
[12:34:19] <bango2> yes im doing that, only my selector is a class im looping through with each()
[12:34:22] <bango2> is that my problem?
[12:34:31] <taplar_lunch> it's redundant
[12:34:34] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to loop fwiw.
[12:34:38] <taplar_lunch> on will bind to all of them
[12:34:39] <robertmaxrees> .on() does that for you.
[12:34:43] <bango2> ok thankee
[12:35:02] <bango2> but even though its redundant its not calling my alert
[12:35:23] <taplar_lunch> it's possible the load is happening before the binding?
[12:35:25] <robertmaxrees> you might be binding after the iframe loads.
[12:35:52] <bango2> yeah thats what i thought. my js is defined in a javascriupts block which all js is loaded after the dom elements
[12:36:01] <bango2> so thats my probelm probably right
[12:36:43] <robertmaxrees> that's not necessarily the same thing.
[12:37:25] <robertmaxrees> but if you need to guarantee that something fires after an iframe loads, you have to create the iframe using JS, bind to it, then set it's source.
[12:37:39] <robertmaxrees> do you control the contents of the iframe?
[12:37:48] <bango2> yes
[12:38:21] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage
[12:38:26] <robertmaxrees> use something like this instead.
[12:38:49] <robertmaxrees> basically, have the iframe emit a message/event for you.
[12:40:03] <bango2> the thing is though, the contents of this iframe will really be an email. im just using iframe to see it as a draft before its sent
[12:40:31] <bango2> so i dont want to clutter it with any styling or javascript other than inline styles
[12:40:35] <robertmaxrees> uh
[12:40:43] <robertmaxrees> is the iframe really another page then?
[12:40:54] <bango2> the contents of the iframe is another page
[12:41:05] <robertmaxrees> then use postmessage.
[12:41:21] <robertmaxrees> a little JS in that template won't kill anything.
[12:41:22] <bango2> use postmessage on the other page youre saying? the page that holds only email data?
[12:41:39] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:41:48] <robertmaxrees> the page that has the email in it needs to post to the parent window.
[12:41:49] <robertmaxrees> trust me.
[12:43:47] <bango2> alright. i trust you, but I don't wanna do that. I want my email pages to be blessed virgins, devoid of anything but content and inline styles. so maybe i need to find a different approach, my original intent is to dynamically resize the iframe's height
[12:44:11] <robertmaxrees> binding to the load event is a shaky proposition - why do you need to do that in the first place?
[12:44:53] <bango2> the plan was to get the height of the framed page
[12:45:07] <bango2> say somewhere on an SO post this little gem 'height': this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'
[12:45:19] <decx> but why
[12:45:23] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:45:31] <bango2> http://stackoverflow.com/a/34317409/4445768
[12:45:38] <robertmaxrees> you're explaining the mechanism by which you want to accomplish a thing, but not what that thing is.
[12:46:22] <bango2> ok,, so loading >1 email in a page, each email in an accordion, and iframe in the accordion. if the email is rather long, i dont want the user to have to scroll
[12:46:31] <bango2> if the email is short, i dont want a ton of whitespace on the end
[12:46:46] <bango2> dynamic height for the email iframes is my goal
[12:46:54] <bango2> based on height on load
[12:47:22] <taplar_lunch> if the email is rather long, and you made the iframe tall, wouldn't you have to scroll the outer page?
[12:47:42] <robertmaxrees> you know that this would be relatively easy if you just loaded the email contents directly into the page, right?
[12:47:52] <robertmaxrees> like, you can easily style things so they look fine.
[12:47:58] <bango2> yes scrolling the outer page is fine, its natural to scroll the main page, not a page within a page
[12:48:14] <taplar_lunch> i scroll jsfiddle all the time, :P
[12:48:19] <bango2> yes and ive done that, but my bootstrap styling conflicts with the virginity of the email
[12:48:21] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[12:48:38] <robertmaxrees> bango2 fwiw it's really strange to refer to it as "virginity", and that explains a lot.
[12:48:59] <bango2> well unadulterated, what have you
[12:49:10] <bango2> not yet deflowered
[12:49:14] <bango2> by the seed of css
[12:49:15] <robertmaxrees> uh
[12:49:16] <bango2> or js
[12:49:26] <taplar_lunch> who knew we'd have this convo today
[12:49:50] <taplar_lunch> it's just code dude.  there are no morals, :P
[12:49:52] <taplar_lunch> just make it work
[12:50:05] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to pretend like you didn't just say any of that and say "you're going to have a bad time" at this point.
[12:50:44] <bango2> alright, thanks for your input though
[12:51:03] <taplar_lunch> oh baby
[12:51:07] <taplar_lunch> wait till i show you my css
[12:51:28] <bango2> when i get to heaven, i will have 1000 emails waiting for me
[12:52:11] <taplar_lunch> my css will make you shiver.  it's got an animate in it yo
[12:52:19] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[13:03:01] <taplar_lunch> sorry baby, i dunno what happened.
[13:03:07] <taplar_lunch> i'm really sorry my css was minified
[13:15:04] <Sal> hi
[13:15:20] <robertmaxrees> hello
[13:15:31] <Sal> can someone please llok at this and ell me if that is the best way of doing plugins with jquery
[13:15:31] <Sal> http://slexy.org/view/s21vWZYmMI
[13:15:41] <Sal> or if there is a better way
[13:15:56] <Sal> don't know, maybe more efficient or faster or less memory taken
[13:16:06] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[13:16:14] <robertmaxrees> this guide should have everything you need.
[13:16:48] <robertmaxrees> also, $.fn.mButton.options = {}; - don't do this.
[13:16:55] <robertmaxrees> make options a local variable to the function.
[13:17:02] <robertmaxrees> instead of making it a property of a function.
[13:17:20] <taplar_lunch> ln 36-41 looks odd
[13:17:43] <taplar_lunch> shouldn't need the each or rewrapping
[13:18:04] <Sal> robertmaxrees, the problem of that link, is that it doens't show how to handle options
[13:18:21] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/#accepting-options
[13:18:21] <decx> no in a plugin like this, the this scope is actually the collection you get taplar_lunch
[13:18:29] <robertmaxrees> Sal yes it does.
[13:18:32] <decx> in top scope*
[13:18:33] <taplar_lunch> ah
[13:18:42] <Sal> damn, i didn't see it, let look again
[13:18:48] <jop008> I have the standar d string of a javascipt date object how can I convert it back to date object?
[13:18:54] <robertmaxrees> i just linked you to the section that talks about it.
[13:18:56] <jop008> I only have the string
[13:19:01] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:20:39] <Sal> ok, robertmaxrees , thanks
[13:26:06] <Sal> robertmaxrees, and what about commands? there nothing about them
[13:26:14] <robertmaxrees> Sal "commands"?
[13:26:19] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[13:26:45] <Sal> i mean: $('button').nButton('disable');
[13:27:08] <robertmaxrees> you test to see what was passed to the function,
[13:27:12] <Sal> mean passing commands instead of options
[13:27:53] <Sal> that was my lines 21-27
[13:28:11] <robertmaxrees> if it was a string, check what that string is and go from ther.e  otherwise, extend your base options object and go from there.
[13:31:32] <Sal> ok, let me start putting the options inside
[13:31:33] <Sal> thanks
[14:05:40] <taplar> hmm, restless sleeping or narcolypse
[14:56:36] <geri_> hi decx
[14:56:52] <taplar> get a room
[15:16:27] <Alives> i want to load a large variable via getscript after onclick, but everytime i do it i get undefined.  i can see the variable via the console though... what am i doing wrong?
[15:16:40] <robertmaxrees> show us what you're doing.
[15:16:52] <Alives> k
[15:20:56] <Alives> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/DHAadxL7
[15:21:30] <robertmaxrees> so where are you getting undefined?
[15:21:38] <robertmaxrees> and what are the contents of /music/playlists/90s-rock.js ?
[15:23:22] <Alives> and heres hte var: http://pastebin.com/cHjGsZrN
[15:23:33] <Alives> i get undefined on shuffle
[15:23:41] <Alives> just a sec ill get the error
[15:24:22] <Alives> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[15:24:40] <Alives> so it seems window.playlist_90s_rock is undefined
[15:24:49] <Alives> but i can see it in the console and all its entries
[15:24:50] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[15:24:55] <decx> it doesnt make sense to predeclare your variable
[15:24:58] <robertmaxrees> *other console errors i mean.
[15:24:59] <decx> just get json
[15:25:02] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[15:25:07] <Alives> ah good idea
[15:25:07] <decx> and use the data you get
[15:25:08] <robertmaxrees> and name it a json file.
[15:25:09] <decx> easy as pie
[15:25:19] <Alives> ok ill work on that
[15:25:45] <Alives> so i use $.get($url, function(data) { var = parsejson(data) } for that?
[15:25:57] <robertmaxrees> no need for var = .
[15:26:01] <Alives> thx
[15:26:03] <decx> there's a getjson shorthand i believe
[15:26:05] <robertmaxrees> just use the data
[15:26:15] <robertmaxrees> and no need to perse it if it's not wrapped in quotes.
[15:26:16] <Alives> spent like 4 hrs on this yesterday :(
[15:26:24] <Alives> ok
[15:27:42] <decx> maybe work on those typing skills if thoses pastes took 4 hours ;D
[15:28:52] <Alives> haha
[15:40:19] <Alives> omfg thanks ppl
[15:40:26] <Alives> so much simpler
[15:40:37] <Alives> such a relief
[15:40:50] <Alives> so awesome!!
[15:41:04] <taplar> :)
[15:44:04] <belea> anyone familiar with swift filter?
[15:44:19] <robertmaxrees> gotta link to some docs?
[15:44:22] <belea> by anychance :D
[15:44:40] <robertmaxrees> http://codecanyon.net/item/swift-filter-jquery-content-filter/13065483 oh.  paid for?
[15:44:52] <belea> yes
[15:44:52] <Alives> followup q:  theres no easy way to zip these jsons so the filesize is smaller is there?
[15:45:00] <belea> trying to find a way to add pagination to it
[15:45:04] <robertmaxrees> Alives compression and gzip
[15:45:07] <Alives> like javascript doesnt really do much with compression libs?
[15:45:20] <robertmaxrees> Alives you compress the file on your server.
[15:45:20] <Alives> i found some stuff on stack overflow but most of it says js doesnt do compression
[15:45:31] <robertmaxrees> Alives because you're not using JS to do compressionb.
[15:45:36] <robertmaxrees> your webserver compresses the file.
[15:45:39] <Alives> i see
[15:45:50] <Alives> and the browser will decompress if mime is gzip type?
[15:46:28] <robertmaxrees> you don't evenneed to worry about it - just enable it on your server.
[15:46:31] <robertmaxrees> it'll take care of the rest.
[15:46:34] <robertmaxrees> http://www.giftofspeed.com/enable-gzip-compression/
[15:46:42] <Alives> well theres an issue with gzip and ssl
[15:46:53] <Alives> so all SSL/TLS sites should be disabling gzip
[15:47:00] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/4063496
[15:47:01] <robertmaxrees> not corect.
[15:47:03] <robertmaxrees> *correct
[15:48:43] <belea> robertmaxrees do you think it would be possible to add to that swift pagination without using json?
[15:48:52] <robertmaxrees> belea i have no idea.
[15:48:55] <belea> :-?
[15:49:06] <robertmaxrees> belea that's a paid for plugin - contact their support.
[15:49:08] <belea> any advice/docs anything on how to figure it?
[15:49:25] <robertmaxrees> yeah - contact their developers.  you paid money, so get your money's worth.
[15:50:24] <Alives> robertmaxrees: i dont follow.. the comment still says its a bad idea to use compression over SSL/TLS...
[15:50:53] <Alives> are you saying if I pre-compress the files and store them as compressed files then its safe?
[15:51:40] <robertmaxrees> Alives you're conflating concepts.  there are some known vulnerabilities.  are you storing sensitive data on your server?
[15:51:51] <Alives> robertmaxrees: i see your point
[15:51:54] <Alives> ok cool
[15:52:14] <Alives> basically that what im hosting isnt a big deal, so just let the webserver compress and not worry about it
[15:53:58] <robertmaxrees> iirc if you disable http compression whenever the referrer header is missing or shows you have a cross-site request, you're g2g.
[15:54:09] <robertmaxrees> but that's just for BREACH.
[15:54:20] <Alives> right
[15:54:22] <Alives> cool thanks!
[15:54:31] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[15:54:32] <Alives> so happy right now that this is working
[15:56:16] <rtd1123> I used jQuery wrapAll() to add a span around a set of TD elements. The trouble is this is throwing off the alignment. Is there a way to for the wrapping element to be ignored within the table structure?
[15:56:24] <robertmaxrees> uh
[15:56:29] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid html.
[15:56:36] <robertmaxrees> so you can't do that :)
[15:56:42] <rtd1123> figured that would be my luck
[15:56:54] <robertmaxrees> you can wrap the contents of TDs in a span.
[15:57:01] <robertmaxrees> but not the TD itself.
[15:57:04] <rtd1123> yah, that won't work
[15:57:10] <rtd1123> back to the drawing board
[15:57:15] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to build?
[15:57:39] <rtd1123> one sec I will get a screen shot
[15:58:40] <rtd1123> http://i.imgur.com/EqN3cPp.png
[15:59:18] <robertmaxrees> what does that have to do with spans?
[15:59:21] <rtd1123> so each one of those little rectangles is a TD representing a 15 minute timeslot
[15:59:41] <robertmaxrees> there are dozens of ways to handle this.
[15:59:43] <rtd1123> I want to be able to drag that red area around to another area, since it's 1 reservation
[15:59:59] <rtd1123> so I was trying to utilize jQuery draggable
[16:00:11] <robertmaxrees> event bindings + state detection on the mouse button.,
[16:00:13] <rtd1123> but I need something that spans the outer limits of all 8 of the TDs that make that up
[16:00:57] <robertmaxrees> nah, just add classes to things.
[16:01:54] <rtd1123> ok, so if I add a class to the outer 8 TD elements for that reservation, and a user starts dragging 1 of them, how will it know to drag all 8 of them together when jQuery draggable is bound to the outer selector?
[16:02:10] <robertmaxrees> you don't use jquery draggable in this case.
[16:02:12] <robertmaxrees> imo.
[16:02:14] <rtd1123> oh
[16:02:36] <rtd1123> any suggestions on an alternative?
[16:02:39] <robertmaxrees> not without changing a whole bunch of other stuff at least.  not worth it.  otherwise you're going to have to basically overlay an element on that table and have it snap.
[16:02:43] <JavaLover> you know how js fiddle exists, is there a place where people can share Design ideas with others working on a project?
[16:02:57] <taplar> github?
[16:03:03] <robertmaxrees> "design ideas"?
[16:03:04] <JavaLover> how would it work on github?
[16:03:10] <JavaLover> like say you have a website
[16:03:13] <taplar> it's just a file repo
[16:03:17] <JavaLover> and you're going "i want this to be better" got any suggestions?
[16:03:24] <JavaLover> and people can upload like "how bout this"
[16:03:35] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[16:03:56] <JavaLover> i'm sure this already exists...
[16:04:10] <robertmaxrees> you're looking for a place that does free design work ;)
[16:04:13] <rtd1123> http://www.justinmind.com/
[16:04:18] <rtd1123> What about something like that?
[16:04:29] <NoiseEee> beauty
[16:04:42] <robertmaxrees> lol totally broken in ff.
[16:04:56] <robertmaxrees> cam'
[16:05:02] <robertmaxrees> *can't scroll, broken animations.
[16:05:19] <rtd1123> odd, I'm using Chrome
[16:05:23] <robertmaxrees> oh it assumes i'll have the browser window fullscreen.
[16:05:26] <rtd1123> ah
[16:05:28] <taplar> heh
[16:05:30] <taplar> same here
[16:05:35] * robertmaxrees nopes out.
[16:05:47] <JavaLover> no it's okay i'm finding places
[16:05:50] <taplar> that sight goes beyond mobile first
[16:05:56] <taplar> site
[16:06:00] <JavaLover> i'm not asking for Free stuff, just wondering there's collab sites
[16:06:35] <cannap> what
[16:06:38] <cannap> you look for
[16:06:48] <robertmaxrees> what you described isn't really a "collab" concept imo.
[16:07:11] <cannap> working together?
[16:07:22] <taplar> you might could do something like that on S.O.  they have their whole review section
[16:08:37] <rtd1123> robertmaxrees: did you have any ideas on how I can accomplish my movable element?
[16:08:56] <robertmaxrees> rtd1123 i just described one way to do it.
[16:10:03] <rtd1123> I'm not sure what you mean by event bindings + state detection, that's pretty generic I guess I am looking for something more specific.
[16:11:36] <robertmaxrees> mousedown on an element + detect if the current element has your "booked" class or whatever.  mouseenter on a neighboring element + detect if mouse1 is down or up.  if down, get the outer bounds of the red area and "move over" by one.
[16:11:40] <robertmaxrees> however you want to figure that out.
[16:12:25] <belea> robertmaxrees it appears the author doesnt support pagination .... i would pay to get some ideas or get it done :( maybe combine it with mixitup plugin or add the functionality
[16:12:40] <robertmaxrees> belea then offer to pay them to do it :)
[16:12:55] <robertmaxrees> or contact them directly.
[16:13:16] <robertmaxrees> *to ask, i mean.
[16:13:40] <rtd1123> robertmaxrees: Thank you, now I see what you mean, I will give it a shot, much appreciated!
[16:13:47] <bango2> im back to the iframe height thing i was talking about earlier, virgin emails.  im successfully loading and setting the height, but the height is very wrong.  its anywhere from 776 to 830px, where it should be less than half that. why would the body of my iframe be so tall?
[16:14:14] <bango2> body of the document within the iframe rather
[16:16:33] <robertmaxrees> dunno without seeing it.
[16:16:49] <belea> robertmaxrees do you think it's ok to ask around here for paid help for it?
[16:16:59] <belea> dont know if it's against channel rules :P
[16:17:23] <robertmaxrees> belea it's not OK actually.
[16:17:31] <robertmaxrees> since this is a support channel.
[16:17:44] <Alives> belea: not to mention you dont know the credibility of the person you'd be interacting with
[16:17:52] <Alives> i think there are sites for that sort of thing
[16:17:53] <belea> got it, true
[16:18:30] <robertmaxrees> bango2 how are you getting the height of the contents of the iframe?
[16:19:25] <bango2> right now im using straight javascript but i was getting the same thing before using jquery
[16:19:26] <bango2> iframe.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight
[16:20:27] <robertmaxrees> yeah, no clue then without seeing it break.
[16:21:01] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to preent plaintext?
[16:21:08] <robertmaxrees> *present
[16:21:10] <robertmaxrees> without any styling.
[16:21:59] <bango2> its not breaking, and no its html but i also have a text version of the email ill give the user a choice to view, but thats for later and not totally relevant to the problem at hand, which is html
[16:22:20] <robertmaxrees> i just really get the feeling that an iframe still isn't the right solution here.
[16:22:24] <bango2> its not breaking, just giving a very large height where the height, to my reckoning, should end at the bottom of content
[16:22:54] <robertmaxrees> right - that's what i mean by "break" - it's not the result you're expecting.
[16:23:05] <bango2> i see
[16:26:44] <bango2> do you have any suggestions other than an iframe? when removal of bootstrap from my main emails list page isnt an option, and i want to show the user exactly what they would be seeing in an email with no css, only the inline styles that will eventually accompany the email itself
[16:27:06] <robertmaxrees> what exactly is bootstrap impacting herE?
[16:27:16] <bango2> styling of generic elements
[16:27:16] <robertmaxrees> also: each mail client shows mail differently.
[16:27:21] <bango2> like p tags for instance
[16:27:34] <bango2> i know, id like the user agent to specify a generic style
[16:27:44] <robertmaxrees> i'd make a little "reset stylesheet" of sorts for those display areas.
[16:28:34] <bango2> i thought about that. but im afraid i wouldnt be able to cover every case for a generic element, and all attributes for all said elements
[16:29:05] <bango2> ive tried some of those clever new css3 tags like all: initial
[16:29:06] <robertmaxrees> you'll use the same one for your preview and for real display.
[16:29:17] <robertmaxrees> there's your consistency.
[16:29:30] <bango2> same reset stylesheet?
[16:29:41] <bango2> i thought emails only support inline css
[16:29:53] <robertmaxrees> err.
[16:29:59] <robertmaxrees> you're not sending any of that with the email.
[16:30:02] <robertmaxrees> just for your side.
[16:30:19] <robertmaxrees> bbiab meeting.
[16:30:20] <bango2> what differentiates preview and real display?
[16:30:23] <bango2> ok
[16:31:33] <cannap> for email just use https://mjml.io/
[16:31:43] <cannap> and yes email only can inline
[16:31:47] <cannap> und email templates sucks
[16:31:47] <cannap> and
[16:32:01] <cannap> also inline in the head or something
[16:32:10] <cannap> no external
[16:32:11] <cannap> ;PO
[16:32:18] <bango2> im using twig to begin with, so email templating is a breeze
[16:32:38] <cannap> yea or this one
[16:32:46] <cannap> when you only make plain
[16:33:03] <cannap> you dont need to write this ugly tables then
[16:33:05] <bango2> but my issue here is that unless i iframe, (or add a reset css which i dont think i can do), the bootstrap css styles the emails so that they arent reflective of what they would really look like when sent out
[16:33:19] <xochilpili> hi there!
[16:33:41] <bango2> hi
[16:33:58] <xochilpili> is it possible to serialize all elements that are displayed? i meant, exlude those who has display:none;
[16:34:34] <xochilpili> $('#codes_frm').find("input[type='hidden'], :input:not(hidden)").serialize(); << i tried this, but acts with hidden and not with display:none;
[16:36:38] <bango2> daisy chain another not(':visible')
[16:36:57] <bango2> or visible rather, since you want the visible elements
[16:37:40] <cannap> is(':visible:') is this the same as not:
[16:37:41] <cannap> no
[16:37:45] <cannap> what im talking
[16:37:47] <cannap> just ignore :P
[16:38:38] <bango2> interesting thing youre doing, getting input type hidden elements, that are... not hidden?
[16:40:07] <cannap> hae
[16:40:12] <cannap> hidden are in serialize
[16:40:16] <cannap> or not?
[16:40:35] <cannap> why you use display:none
[16:40:47] <cannap> honeypot?
[16:41:12] <cannap> i dont understand this complex 5d matrix!
[16:43:12] <bango2> input type hidden that has been styled with some visible display parameter
[16:58:56] <bango2> I think im going to hack it together by just dividing the calculated height by 2, and test it in many browsers with many types of email templates

[17:53:56] <badcss> for some reason the positioning is all jacked up, anyone have any idea why?
[17:54:13] <badcss> it also doesn't seem to be snapping to the correct areas on scroll
[17:54:53] <robertmaxrees> ow my ears.
[17:55:23] <robertmaxrees> did you check out their examples?
[17:55:30] <robertmaxrees> for things like fixed headers and whatnot?
[17:55:48] <badcss> Yep
[17:56:06] <badcss> I defined the fixed header and normalScrollElements
[17:56:20] <badcss> also changed the sectionSelector to my selector
[17:56:51] <badcss> Here is my js to initialize it: http://pastebin.com/cwHMeLiJ
[17:57:14] <bango2> i realized the problem I was having.  the height it was calculating for the iframe was correct... for the standard iframe width.  I was setting the iframe widths to 100% in my css, which *should* load and be rendered to be 100% before the iframe contents ever load, right? so now I don't know how to say "hey iframe, be this wide before you load your contents"
[17:57:40] <robertmaxrees> bango2 there's really no way to do that.
[17:57:48] <bango2> :-(
[17:58:01] <decx> haha that site in its current state is the perfect advertisement for not fucking around with the user scrolling ^^
[17:58:13] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[17:58:16] <badcss> I think it has to do with the fade in/delays on the homepage changing the container height
[17:58:24] <robertmaxrees> also: the sound effects are really distracting.
[17:58:48] <robertmaxrees> but that's beside the point.
[17:59:06] <bango2> "man i just wanna read about shrink sleeves"
[17:59:07] <badcss> decx I really just wanted it for the full screen aspect for certain sections of the page, the snap-to-section aspect isnt ideal
[17:59:23] <decx> just use height 100%
[18:00:32] <badcss> decx then how would I set the content to be in the center of the page?
[18:00:38] <badcss> vertically aligned
[18:00:45] <robertmaxrees> why do you need that?
[18:00:47] <badcss> i'm 100% open to suggestions :P
[18:00:53] <robertmaxrees> like, why jack user scrolling at all?
[18:00:53] <badcss> client wants it
[18:00:57] <decx> position: absolute; top:50%; left:50%; transform: translate(-50%,-50%)
[18:01:59] <decx> 50% in top and left is relative to parent, -50% in translate is relative to element size
[18:02:08] <decx> tadaa
[18:02:08] <badcss> Thanks decx :D
[18:07:21] <jak2000> hi all
[18:07:53] <taplar> aloha
[18:26:55] <z1haze> would this be a jquery object, https://gyazo.com/6d070556d4522943600f5552c4882886 or can you not tell?
[18:27:11] <robertmaxrees> probably.
[18:31:04] <progbot> Is there a way I can use a wildcard in .hasClass()?
[18:31:27] <robertmaxrees> nope.  you can use .prop('class') and use a regex or indexof
[18:31:37] <progbot> Cool, thanks
[18:32:09] <taplar> or is() with a selector with the regex
[18:32:33] <robertmaxrees> ah yeah that takes a selector.
[18:37:17] <taplar> *sigh* today blows.  i got in late due to the time change so i have to stay late, >_<
[18:38:03] * taplar sings some hootie and the blowfish
[18:43:11] <robertmaxrees> bummer.

[19:18:47] <progbot> z1haze: it's the extra space throwing you off. You want $('li[data-id="income"]')
[19:19:03] <z1haze> oh ok

[21:46:43] <geri> hi decx
[22:03:46] <albedoa> https://jsfiddle.net/x5okv5nk/ what's a good way to shrink the <ul> to the width of these inline-block items? i believe it is impossible with css based on this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23899558/css-make-ul-list-wrap-li
[22:35:22] <z1haze> albedoa, ul { display: inline-block; }
[22:35:46] <albedoa> :P thanks
[22:36:06] <albedoa> it's a bit more complicated (see the example and first answer in the SO question)
[22:36:21] <albedoa> i guess media queries is the non-js solution
[22:36:40] <z1haze> you asked why your ul was extending out padded the list items
[22:36:55] <z1haze> its because the ul was a block element, its always gonig to do that, and its got nothing to do with the js
[22:38:25] <albedoa> that is not my question
[22:38:39] <z1haze> " what's a good way to shrink the <ul> to the width of these inline-block items?"
[22:38:45] <albedoa> yeah
[22:38:56] <z1haze> https://jsfiddle.net/x5okv5nk/2/
[22:39:27] <albedoa> wut tho
[22:39:38] <z1haze> ?
[22:39:39] <albedoa> do this: remove the /2 from your url
[22:40:02] <z1haze> whats your original and the /2 is what i fixed
[22:41:16] <albedoa> open the original and yours side-by-side
[22:42:01] <z1haze> dude i gave you the answer
[22:42:18] <z1haze> https://gyazo.com/047168b80a315339c6637a0afeff8be4
[22:42:58] <albedoa> https://jsfiddle.net/x5okv5nk/5/
[22:43:10] <z1haze> jesus
[22:43:16] <z1haze> im done
[22:43:18] <albedoa> right?
[22:43:24] <z1haze> you keep fucking changing it back
[22:43:31] <albedoa> to what?
[22:43:31] <z1haze> and you wonder why its broken
[22:43:39] <z1haze> <z1haze> albedoa, ul { display: inline-block; }
[22:43:43] <albedoa> yes
[22:43:44] <z1haze> thats your answer
[22:43:46] <z1haze> leave it in there
[22:44:07] <albedoa> lol
[22:44:15] <albedoa> i literally opened yours and hit update
[22:44:34] <z1haze> clearly you didnt.
[22:45:08] <albedoa> anyway, that's not the question
[22:45:21] <z1haze> well, it was the question you asked
[22:45:25] <albedoa> nope
[22:45:27] <albedoa> scroll up
[22:45:43] <z1haze> ive read your question, several times.
[22:45:55] <z1haze> what's a good way to shrink the <ul> to the width of these inline-block items?
[22:45:59] <albedoa> clearly you didnt.
[22:46:02] <z1haze> which is EXACTLY what i told you how to do
[22:46:03] <albedoa> right
[22:46:06] <z1haze> good luck
[22:46:06] <albedoa> nah
[22:46:08] <albedoa> lol
[22:52:22] <spoonUltra> What command buttons do you have to press to make a line indent backwards?
[22:52:53] <spoonUltra> I should say Ctrl*
[22:53:30] <arc_> you mean remove a level of indentation?
[22:53:44] <albedoa> spoonUltra depends on the system and editor, but usually shift + whatever you type to indent inward
[22:54:00] <albedoa> shift+tab for instance
[22:54:12] <spoonUltra> yes arc_
[22:54:17] <spoonUltra> ah
[22:54:22] <albedoa> cmd+[ on many Mac editors
[22:55:01] <spoonUltra> Shift Tab makes lines of codes delete on Sublime in Windows
[22:55:24] <albedoa> well you don't want that
[22:55:29] <albedoa> try ctrl+[
[22:55:31] <spoonUltra> Never mind. I had to do it without highlighting...
[22:55:38] <albedoa> ah yeah
[22:56:19] <albedoa> also try alt+[ i forget which does what in Windows
