[05:21:26] <inthl> when doing a crossdomain ajax call I am facing the problem with `Credential is not supported if the CORS header ..is set to *', but I can not set this to a specific domain since the access may come from an e.g. mobile app or something where the origin is always empty - but I would like to access and set the session variables for a php script in my case, is this somehow possible?
[07:31:17] <onizu> hi
[07:31:44] <onizu> http://beyonddesign.in/estimation/testJS/testJS.php ---- why is the click not giving an alert?
[08:21:54] <onizu> damn, a simple click event is not triggering :(
[09:30:14] <Uhkis> onizu: you're missing quotes from the selector
[09:31:01] <onizu> yes, got it
[11:03:55] <Jquerynewbi> I am trying to create a click event for an object that doesn't exist in the original DOM and that is created dynamically after a series of event have taken place. My click(function) event is not working because the element was created after the DOM was loaded. What is the best way to handle that specific case?
[11:10:51] <Uhkis> Jquerynewbi: $(originalDOMitem).on('click', 'yourDynamicItem', function(){});
[11:17:31] <Jquerynewbi> thank you
[12:30:09] <tona> how can I remove mydemo class  <div><h2><a href="none" class="mydemo"></a><h2></div> what select could I use for it
[12:32:01] <thykka> $('.mydemo').removeClass('mydemo').addClass('myotherdemo')
[12:32:38] <thykka> oh, forget about the .addClass part, I misread remove as "replace"..
[12:34:36] <tona> this only thykka $('.mydemo').removeClass('mydemo').
[12:34:45] <thykka> yup
[12:34:58] <thykka> without the trailing perido
[12:35:00] <thykka> *period
[12:35:04] <tona> ok
[12:36:17] <tona> but could I use like this one $('h2 > a ').removeClass();
[12:36:37] <thykka> you could, yes
