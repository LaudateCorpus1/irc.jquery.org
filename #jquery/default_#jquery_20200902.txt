[11:39:21] <grid-> hey
[11:39:26] <grid-> what jquery i have to use to add dropdown-submenu to all classes that have class="menu-item-has-children" ?
[11:41:07] <Turmfalke> .addClass() should do it
[11:42:09] <grid-> yes, but it should only add it if the class has menu-item-has-children already
[11:42:30] <grid-> so it would become for example class="menu-item-has-children dropdown-submenu"
[11:42:51] <grid-> or class="whatever more names menu-item-has-children dropdown-submenu"
[11:45:21] <Turmfalke> Well, select the target elements as usual with $("...")
[11:53:59] <grid-> menu-item-has-children is always at the last position of the class
[11:54:28] <grid-> do you have an example what to use?
[12:34:05] <robertmaxrees> grid- how about you try and then show us where you get stuck? :)
[12:35:31] <Northwoodss> how can i select all dropdowns from closest('form')
[12:35:46] <Northwoodss> onclick of submit , i need to get all selects in taht form
[12:36:01] <robertmaxrees> Northwoodss bind to submit instead.  and what do you think it'd be?
[12:36:05] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:36:13] <grid-> robertmaxrees: i'm currently here https://jsfiddle.net/w4x63ej8/1/ and i need to add dropdown-submenu to all classes that hav nav-item and don't have dropdown
[12:37:44] <Northwoodss> robertmaxrees, no idea
[12:37:50] <grid-> so each class should have atleast nav-item that is going to be updated and that same class must not have dropdown
[12:38:00] <robertmaxrees> Northwoodss .closest('form').find('select')
[12:38:02] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:38:09] <grid-> if it also has dropdown it doesn't need to get updated
[12:38:25] <Northwoodss> :)
[12:38:26] <Northwoodss> lol
[12:38:28] <Northwoodss> Thanks
[12:38:57] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:39:10] <robertmaxrees> Northwoodss but yeah, bind to the submit event instead :)
[12:39:27] <Northwoodss> yes
[12:39:30] <robertmaxrees> grid- that onload jquery check is... weird.
[12:40:08] <grid-> yeah it should be on document ready
[12:40:11] <grid-> i know :)
[12:40:12] <grid-> i change it
[12:40:25] <robertmaxrees> grid- also: just select .menu-item-has-children
[12:40:28] <robertmaxrees> just like in css.
[12:41:16] <grid-> https://jsfiddle.net/w4x63ej8/2/
[12:41:16] <robertmaxrees> your selector right now says "select elements with the class li and whose class attribute contains "=menu-item-has-children", none of which makes sense.
[12:42:36] <robertmaxrees> also: why are you adding another class to an element that already has a class specifying what you need?
[12:44:14] <grid-> because dropdown-submenu makes part of a bootstrap framework, it will add some customisation to the end goal
[12:44:31] <robertmaxrees> then why not just add it to the markup from the backend?
[12:44:32] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:44:36] <robertmaxrees> instead of from the frontend.
[12:45:25] <grid-> robertmaxrees: because it is a wordpress theme, the html markup is generated by some (java)scripts
[12:45:48] <grid-> https://crs.productswitch.nl/wordpress
[12:46:06] <robertmaxrees> (java)scripts???
[12:46:13] <robertmaxrees> wordpress is php, not java.
[12:46:49] <robertmaxrees> and that site nav is generated server-side, not client-side :) but alright.
[12:46:50] <grid-> well, it has a bootstrap theme, i thought bootstrap made the script by using .js
[12:47:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it's using bootstrap, but the core markup is all generated server-side.
[12:47:13] <grid-> yes
[12:47:24] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: hence my suggestion lol
[12:47:28] <robertmaxrees> but alrighty.
[12:47:45] <Robdgreat> "uses a bootstrap theme" isn't the same as "is written in bootstrap" which isn't actually a thing
[12:47:52] <robertmaxrees> ^ that, too
[12:48:20] <Robdgreat> see I'm useful for something sometimes other than eating robertmaxrees highlights
[12:48:22] <grid-> if you click on support on https://crs.productswitch.nl/wordpress/ and you hover on FAQ you will see a new menu is being generated, once that nav-item class contains dropdown-submenu the menu will be on the right side of the parent menu
[12:48:29] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[12:48:50] <robertmaxrees> grid- none of that is changing my base suggestion lol
[12:48:57] <robertmaxrees> but alrighty :)
[12:49:06] <robertmaxrees> either way - you figure out the selector?
[12:49:07] <grid-> that's why i wanna change all nav-items that will need that dropdown-submenu
[12:49:49] <grid-> and those are the ones that have nav-item and also don't have dropdown
[12:50:00] <robertmaxrees> gotcha - so did you get the selector you needed?
[12:51:24] <grid-> i know what i have to change, that is a class that has nav-item and that same class can't have dropdown
[12:51:40] <grid-> then all the child menu's are working
[12:51:54] <grid-> still need to figure out what jquery function to fire off
[12:52:19] <robertmaxrees> super confused now lol.
[12:56:08] <grid-> so it's something like a regular expression that i need to add here https://jsfiddle.net/w4x63ej8/3/ for that?
[12:56:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?  why do you need a regular expression to select a class?
[12:56:43] <grid-> i did guess a little bit
[12:57:01] <robertmaxrees> again - .li means you want elements with the class "li", which is not what you want.  and [class=menu-item-has-children] means you want elements whose class attribute is set to menu-item-has-children.
[12:57:07] <robertmaxrees> why not just use a plain class selector?
[12:57:12] <robertmaxrees> instead of an attribute selector?
[12:58:26] <robertmaxrees> grid- are you not familiar with how to select elements via class?
[13:00:14] <grid-> it's here https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/faq/how-do-i-select-an-item-using-class-or-id/
[13:00:30] <robertmaxrees> correct :)
[13:06:34] <grid-> how could i add dropdown-submenu to anything that is <li class="nav-item    menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page menu-item-has-children"> with .addClass('dropdown-submenu'); ?
[13:06:48] <robertmaxrees> how do you think.
[13:06:50] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:08:12] <grid-> something like    $('nav-item    menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page menu-item-has-children').addClass('dropdown-submenu');
[13:08:19] <robertmaxrees> so back up.
[13:08:24] <robertmaxrees> how do you select something with one class?
[13:09:39] <robertmaxrees> (refer back to that learn.jquery page)
[13:10:56] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[13:11:06] <grid-> yes i need the selecton i assume
[13:11:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:11:20] <grid-> s/selecton/selector
[13:11:36] <robertmaxrees> how would you select using just the class menu-item-has-children?
[13:11:57] <robertmaxrees> if the example of the jquery learning site is $( ".myCssClass" );
[13:12:12] <robertmaxrees> what would you do for the class menu-item-has-children?
[13:12:24] <robertmaxrees> *example on
[13:12:34] <grid-> it has to start .nav-item
[13:12:56] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you'd select menu-item-has-children, that's how you's select nav-item, but sure.
[13:13:12] <grid-> $('.nav-item menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page menu-item-has-children').addClass('dropdown-submenu'); comes more close i believe
[13:13:31] <robertmaxrees> so with CSS and with jquery, if you want to select an element with multiple classes, you just string together all of those .CssClass selectors, periods and all, without spaces.
[13:14:17] <robertmaxrees> so what do you think that might look like?  make sure to closely read what I said.
[13:15:20] <grid-> >.> you said
[13:15:32] <robertmaxrees> no
[13:15:37] <robertmaxrees> "so with CSS and with jquery, if you want to select an element with multiple classes, you just string together all of those .CssClass selectors, periods and all, without spaces."
[13:16:07] <grid-> without spaces, so how do i seperate the names? with dots?
[13:16:08] * Robdgreat is on the edge of his seat
[13:16:33] <robertmaxrees> grid- you don't "separate" them with dots, but same basic premise :)
[13:16:55] <grid-> $('.nav-item.menu-item.menu-item-type-post_type.menu-item-object-page.menu-item-has-children').addClass('dropdown-submenu');
[13:16:56] <Robdgreat> the dot is part of the selector
[13:17:02] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[13:17:07] <robertmaxrees> the dot means "class"
[13:17:56] <robertmaxrees> if you don't put spaces between each part of the selector, then you're saying "i want an element that has all of these classes/this id/this tagname"
[13:18:11] <robertmaxrees> a space means "i want an element that's a descendent of this other element.
[13:18:13] <robertmaxrees> "
[13:18:54] <grid-> so this is still incorrect https://jsfiddle.net/w4x63ej8/4/ ?
[13:19:07] <robertmaxrees> why is that incorrect?
[13:19:15] <Robdgreat> but if you have the ability to use fewer classes while still getting the set you desire, it helps readability
[13:19:22] <Robdgreat> sometimes you don't have that ability, though
[13:19:36] <robertmaxrees> grid- https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xe5h798m/ works fine here
[13:19:45] <grid-> yes it is :)
[13:19:49] <robertmaxrees> grid- do you mean the bootstrap menus aren't working the way you'd expect?
[13:20:11] <grid-> didn't check it out yet on the live page
[13:20:30] <robertmaxrees> so you asked if it was wrong before validating it yourself??? lol uh... okay?
[13:21:03] <grid-> no, i overlooked something :)
[13:21:11] <robertmaxrees> hrm, alright.
[13:38:09] <grid-> robertmaxrees: i did add the script on https://crs.productswitch.nl/wordpress/ (submenu.js) but it doesn't load yet
[13:38:25] <robertmaxrees> you need to load it after jquery.
[13:38:53] <robertmaxrees> also wordpress likes to set noConflict mode by default.
[13:39:17] <robertmaxrees> check your console - if you get an error about "$ is not a function", there's a simple tweak you can make.
[13:39:30] <grid-> i did set the script at line 42 and i believe the correct jquery is 1 line above it
[13:39:38] <robertmaxrees> then check the second issue :)
[13:40:33] <grid-> yeah in the console.log it says: submenu.js?ver=5.5:1 Uncaught TypeError: $ is not a function
[13:40:33] <grid->     at submenu.js?ver=5.5:1
[13:41:04] <robertmaxrees> yep.  so then it's probably the noconflict wordpress sets.  just change your document ready to jQuery(function($) { instead.
[13:41:52] <grid-> yes it works now
[13:42:18] <robertmaxrees> cool
[13:43:21] <grid-> yes, but the class name is also added to <li class="nav-item  dropdown  menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page menu-item-has-children"> so the title menu's are also running like a child menu
[13:43:40] <robertmaxrees> what's the difference between those and the elements you DO want?
[13:43:50] <robertmaxrees> (i'm not going to read all of the classnames to compare lol)
[13:45:54] <grid-> there is <li class="nav-item  dropdown  menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page menu-item-has-children"> (the one of the title names of the navbar items) and there is <li class="nav-item    menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page menu-item-has-children"> the one of the child submenu's
[13:45:59] <robertmaxrees> dude lol
[13:46:07] <robertmaxrees> what are the differences between the two?
[13:47:07] <grid-> <li class="nav-item  dropdown  menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page menu-item-has-children"> is a title like: Shortcuts or Support and the other ones are the expandable titles in the menu
[13:47:16] <robertmaxrees> i mean in classes.
[13:49:34] <grid-> hmmm, only i know there is .nav-item.menu-item.menu-item-type-post_type.menu-item-object-page.menu-item-has-children and .nav-item.dropdown.menu-item.menu-item-type-post_type.menu-item-object-page.menu-item-has-children and that they are treated equally
[13:49:34] <robertmaxrees> let me explain: you need to figure out what makes the two elements different.  then you can use that to filter out the ones you don't want.
[13:49:47] <robertmaxrees> i want to slap my forehead so hard right now.
[13:49:52] <grid-> haha :)
[13:49:53] <robertmaxrees> so one has dropdown and the other doesn't?
[13:49:55] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'm asking.
[13:49:58] <grid-> yes
[13:50:12] <robertmaxrees> okay.  and you don't want the ones with .dropdown i take it?
[13:50:18] <grid-> indeed
[13:50:38] <robertmaxrees> then use .not('.dropdown')
[13:51:20] <robertmaxrees> $('.your.super.long.list.of.classes').not('.dropdown')
[13:51:30] <grid-> lol
[13:52:49] <robertmaxrees> is the dropdown thing why you tried to use that super long selector?
[13:52:57] <robertmaxrees> *dropdown class thing, I mean.
[13:56:08] * robertmaxrees plays the jeopardy think music.
[13:56:32] <grid-> yes and no, i made it now like $('.nav-item.menu-item-has-children').not('.dropdown').addClass('dropdown-submenu');
[13:56:48] <robertmaxrees> smart.  may not even need that .nav-item even :)
[13:56:58] <grid-> correct
[13:57:02] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:08:23] <grid-> the menu's still aren't working totally correct, when you click on a title the menu will stay in the background, so when you open another menu there are 2 menu's
[14:08:29] <robertmaxrees> Link?
[14:08:38] <grid-> https://crs.productswitch.nl/wordpress/
[14:08:49] <robertmaxrees> also: please kill that alert lol
[14:08:54] <robertmaxrees> or replace it with a console log.
[14:09:27] <robertmaxrees> so where's your js for those menus?
[14:09:59] <grid-> https://crs.productswitch.nl/wordpress/wp-content/themes/wp-bootstrap-4/assets/js/submenu.js
[14:10:21] <robertmaxrees> hold up - are you trying to change that dropdown menu to be on click instead of hover?
[14:10:45] <grid-> yes
[14:11:17] <robertmaxrees> so webdev 101: tell us your overall goal first up :)
[14:12:29] <robertmaxrees> secondly: this is going to be a pain without modifying the server-side part of this.
[14:13:51] <grid-> the goal of that site is just to have a blog about programming idea's
[14:14:23] <robertmaxrees> also: making users click on menus should generally be avoided.  use mouseenter/mouseleave instead.
[14:14:27] <robertmaxrees> much friendlier.
[14:14:29] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:15:47] <grid-> so i just have to avoid you can click on a title that will keep the menu in the background
[14:16:04] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to add the click interaction?
[14:17:16] <grid-> the click interaction is a default setting (i think) https://www.codeply.com/go/ji5ijk6yJ4
[14:18:06] <robertmaxrees> then kill the data-toggle="dropdown"  stuff
[14:22:32] <grid-> yes, if class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" are removed, only the hover effect remains
[14:22:36] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, kill that .navbar-nav li:hover > ul.dropdown-menu { if you want to kill the hover interaction.
[14:26:43] <grid-> if i remove .navbar-nav li:hover > ul.dropdown-menu { display: block; } it is only clickable but then the but then the menus don't expand
[14:27:32] <robertmaxrees> you remove either that CSS or data-toggle="dropdown"
[14:27:34] <robertmaxrees> not both.
[14:29:52] <grid-> how would you just remove the hover effect so the menu's are still expending? i didn't remove data-toggle="dropdown" along with that
[14:30:41] <robertmaxrees> i literally just removed that css..
[14:30:59] <grid-> navbar-nav li:hover > ul.dropdown-menu { display: block; } if this is removed the menu will hide if i click on the second title but the child menu's arent expending anymore
[14:31:18] <robertmaxrees> okay, so that's your second issue :)
[14:31:22] <robertmaxrees> "now the submenus don't work"
[14:31:26] <robertmaxrees> let's fix that next :)
[14:31:48] <robertmaxrees> so what doesn't that link have that it should?
[14:32:12] <robertmaxrees> The google link, that is.
[14:32:40] <grid-> display: block; is required probably in order to expend the menu's
[14:32:52] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:32:53] <grid-> or
[14:33:00] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what that line of CSS was doing?
[14:33:07] <robertmaxrees> try reading it :)
[14:33:22] <grid-> .navbar-nav li:hover > ul.dropdown-menu {     display: block; } this rule only has to take effect on the childs, not on the primary titles
[14:33:35] <robertmaxrees> but do you understand what it's doing?
[14:33:57] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what .navbar-nav li:hover > ul.dropdown-menu means?
[14:34:32] <grid-> yes it's a css path
[14:34:41] <robertmaxrees> so explain what it means.
[14:36:21] <grid-> the rules of that path are made to take effect on the .navbar-nav class and will create a hover effect on anything third level that has ul.dropdown-menu
[14:36:34] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:36:56] <grid-> or it will set a display:block; setting, which means it will stay in the front
[14:37:05] <robertmaxrees> nope.  :)
[14:37:30] <grid-> display: block means that the element is displayed as a block, as paragraphs and headers have always been.
[14:37:34] <robertmaxrees> it looks for all <li> elements under .navbar-nav - when the user hovers over those <li> elements, it looks for <ul>s with the class .dropdown-menu and sets them to display: block;
[14:37:46] <robertmaxrees> your understanding of what the selector was doing was off.
[14:38:39] <grid-> so am i right that it only needs to take it's effect on the menu's and not on the titles?
[14:38:44] <robertmaxrees> wrong.
[14:38:57] <robertmaxrees> if you don't want the hover effect any more, you do not want that css.
[14:40:00] <grid-> you see now it has been removed: https://crs.productswitch.nl/wordpress/
[14:40:00] <robertmaxrees> that css is what's powering the hover effect.
[14:40:07] <grid-> but you see the menu's don't expend anymore
[14:40:23] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/RujRlBL.png on click they do.
[14:41:01] <grid-> yes
[14:41:09] <robertmaxrees> so then what's the issue????
[14:42:07] <grid-> if you now Hover on Finance (beneath Shortcuts) you will not get a 2nd or 3th level menu
[14:42:12] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[14:42:18] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[14:42:25] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[14:42:34] <robertmaxrees> why do you want one to happen on over but the other to happen on click???
[14:43:22] <grid-> because that is how i wanted to reach the goal, i like it more that way
[14:43:54] <robertmaxrees> trust me, you want all clicks or all hovers.
[14:44:01] <robertmaxrees> not a mishmash.
[14:46:28] <grid-> ok but i still think that if i wanna keep the hover effect on the menu's instead of the navbar main titles i would still need that css rule there, aint i right?
[14:46:43] <robertmaxrees> you would need to modify that css rule, yes
[14:48:00] <grid-> so it comes again close to match it only if there is not a dropdown name
[14:48:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:48:58] <robertmaxrees> if you want further CSS or Bootstrap support, i'd seek out a channel for those topics :)
[14:49:30] <robertmaxrees> but i strongly caution you to not setup that UI that way.  you'll confuse your end users a ton.
[14:50:32] <grid-> so i'm going for the click only, then you would advice to click on a menu to expend it?
[14:50:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:51:04] <robertmaxrees> you mean click on the menu and submenus?
[14:51:06] <grid-> you said go for a hover effect or a lick effect
[14:51:10] <grid-> yes
[14:51:49] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.  yeah.  go for one or the other.  usually you want to go with a hover because that's what end users on the web are used to.  if you really want to minimalkly confuse them, then yeah go with clicks.
[15:06:44] <grid-> robertmaxrees: the menu's are now clickable https://crs.productswitch.nl/wordpress/ with the hover effect only on the submenu's
[15:06:53] <robertmaxrees> :(
[15:06:57] <robertmaxrees> bummer.
[15:07:07] <grid-> i will evaluate how this goes, otherwise i will gonna change it for you and myself :)
[15:07:15] <grid-> and the rest of the world
[15:07:19] <robertmaxrees> good luck
[15:10:24] <grid-> thanks to Turmfalke on #css :)
[15:11:06] <Turmfalke> ;)
[15:19:56] <grid-> brb
