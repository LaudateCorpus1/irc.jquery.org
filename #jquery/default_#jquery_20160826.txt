[03:55:08] <dassaffe> morning fellow cats, I have a question, already asked on SO but still unanswered. Maybe you can give me an idea if this is possible or not, and if so, how.
[03:55:30] <dassaffe> I'll show you the SO question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39121377/different-speed-for-slider-when-clicking-or-autoplaying
[04:18:51] <nielsnl> hello all, i have a question; i like to resize div's height with a mouse. Does anyone know a solution for that? Or an idea on what i should search for?
[04:20:39] <paul____> how can I  open an external panel on page load ? ($("#id").panel("open"); doesn't seem to respond for me) (paste : https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9064b77ee027fbdbdf32a118c89fc34e live  http://jsbin.com/vijugileni (failed to understand how to better give a link from jsbin) )
[04:41:23] <Cork> nielsnl: you need to start tracking the mousemove on the page on mousedown
[04:41:46] <paul____> Cork, could you help me too ?
[04:41:49] <Cork> nielsnl: and then resize the div based on how much the mouse has moved from the position it was at on mouse down
[04:41:54] <Cork> paul_just give it a min
[04:42:00] <paul____> thanks
[04:42:35] <Cork> nielsnl: you could try searching for something like "javascript resize element on mousemove"
[04:43:29] <Cork> paul____: also avoid using jsbin for questions, when more then one person is modifying those they lose changes right left and center
[04:43:35] <paul____> I found that I should have given http://jsbin.com/vijugileni/1/edit?html,output as the paste link
[04:43:36] <Cork> (so i never touch those)
[04:43:48] <paul____> oh , will paste in pastebin than
[04:43:55] <Cork> use jsfiddle.net
[04:44:06] <paul____> it didn't work for me:-(
[04:44:10] <Cork> it is basically like jsbin, but it doesn't lose changes (you have to click a button to save)
[04:44:17] <Cork> paul____: didn't work?
[04:44:54] <paul____> Cork , I failed to correctly serpate so that when I click on run it would work as I expect
[04:45:07] <paul____> the docuemnt.on didn't seem to run
[04:46:59] <paul____> Cork, http://pastebin.com/LV4HRSfd
[04:47:30] <Cork> paul____: https://jsfiddle.net/q3w35t65/
[04:47:45] <Cork> also, i can't help with jqm, i don't use it
[04:48:02] <paul____> Cork , same error the docuemnt.on doesn't seem to work there
[04:48:15] <paul____> Thank you anyway
[04:48:17] <Cork> ah, it is cause of the head, body part
[04:48:31] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/q3w35t65/1/
[04:48:54] <paul____> what did you change ?
[04:49:10] <Cork> the option in hte javascript section (top right)
[04:49:20] <Cork> i changed from onload to no wrap head
[04:50:14] <paul____> ok, now the issue is that $("#id).panel("open"); shuold work to open (with non external this approach works) , but here it doesn't seem to do anything
[04:50:28] <paul____> maybe there is some JS thing I didn't do correctly ?
[04:50:54] <Cork> donno, i don't know the jqm events
[04:56:14] <idmistir> Hi, I'm using jqmigrate and I'm getting Global events are undocumented and deprecated .. how can I check which line of code produced that warning?
[05:05:06] <Cork> idmistir: i think it does that but default
[05:06:07] <idmistir> Cork; yeah hadn't notice the trace ^^
[05:06:12] <idmistir> thanks :-)
[05:31:10] <_Justice_> I'm trying to have animation when appending items to list. Right now I got a list with items. The list is
[05:31:26] <_Justice_> I got issues with animation of height when appending stuff to a list.
[05:32:12] <Justice> List is display:none, and i tried show('slow') on it, it works correctly by sliding down.
[05:32:55] <Justice> however when the list already got 500px height for example and i remove current items and append new that makes the hight shorter it slides down again.
[05:33:17] <Justice> height*
[05:33:56] <Justice> is there a way to make this work correctly or do i have to make a global var setting the height and using animation function ?
[05:38:57] <idmistir> Can someone please help me understand why ln#21 on http://hastebin.com/qofopiwubi.coffee generates a JQMIGRATE: Global events are undocumented and deprecated warning?
[05:40:18] <nirakara> hi im using react with two files, blogs.js and comments.js; I have a JSX element CommentBox which is throwing a reference error. but if I merge the two files everything works fine. both files are listed in sources in inspector. any help? my base file here: https://dpaste.de/Ckyp (i've tried importing them in both orders possible).
[05:53:10] <Cork> idmistir: do you have a click handler bound to sub-popup ?
[06:04:31] <idmistir> Cork; I'm activating the fancybox with the click
[06:04:59] <Cork> idmistir: try disabling that handler to see if you still get the error
[06:05:29] <Cork> idmistir: btw, what version are you updating to?
[06:06:27] <idmistir> Cork; 1.7 -> 1.12.0
[06:06:56] <Cork> hmm, ya, then trigger should definitely not be a problem...
[06:07:11] <idmistir> Cork; also, what do you mean disable the handler? it's fancybox's handler
[06:07:43] <Cork> idmistir: what i mean is comment out all the code that does anything on that trigger call
[06:07:53] <Cork> so it is just that call but nothing happens
[06:14:44] <nirakara> hi im using react with two files, blogs.js and comments.js; I have a JSX element CommentBox which is throwing a reference error. but if I merge the two files everything works fine. both files are listed in sources in inspector. any help? my base file here: https://dpaste.de/Ckyp (i've tried importing them in both orders possible).

[07:36:22] <organatik> if i have problem i can post here?
[07:37:59] <decx> yes but wait for the americans to get into the office
[07:38:20] <Cork> O_o
[07:38:22] <Cork> why?
[07:38:33] <decx> so we can be lazy
[07:38:36] <decx> ssssh Cork
[07:38:49] <Uhkis> :D
[07:38:51] <Cork> organatik: have you had a look at learn.jqeury.com ?
[07:39:00] <Cork> *jquery.com

[07:41:52] <organatik> but im happy to get answer from you
[07:58:22] <aditsu_> hi, I have a bunch of divs, one after another, and only one of them is visible; I'd like to replace the visible div with another one, with a slide down effect on top of it, not pushing down the visible div nor hiding the div before the new one finishes sliding, how to do that?
[08:28:33] <aditsu_> wow, it's a ghost town here..
[08:41:45] <deez_nuts> aditsu its always best to create a fiddle, its kinda hard to understand what you mean with that animation
[08:44:10] <deez_nuts> by slide down you probably mean fade out ?
[08:44:35] <deez_nuts> if they are all on top of each other what is there to slide ?
[09:06:29] <hariom> Hi, I am making a site like powerpoint for presenting slides. I want to generate thumbnail of all the slides and show it where needed
[09:07:31] <hariom> If a user is creating a presentation, how can I show the thumbnail of it? One way is to show image thumbnail and another way is to show the entire slide in a smaller dimension\
[09:08:11] <hariom> I am more interested in smaller dimention as that would avoid generating images for every slide ever created
[09:12:22] <aditsu_> deez_nuts: oh hi, yeah I was making a fiddle, here's what I have so far: https://jsfiddle.net/vgh1tjm2/
[09:13:24] <aditsu_> it's close to what I want, but the new div should always slide down on top of the current one, and the text below should not move
[09:14:39] <aditsu_> and no, I did not mean fade out
[09:15:11] <taplar> so your kinda wanting to move the one that is going to expand to be on top of the one collapsing
[09:15:32] <deez_nuts> ok i didnt get it from your description first :-)
[09:15:49] <aditsu_> I'd actually like the old one to stay unchanged until the new one finishes sliding, then it can hide
[09:15:52] <decx> step one, remove every occurence of slideUp/Down
[09:16:00] <aditsu_> for now I'm sliding it up..
[09:16:24] <decx> step two, write an active class that transitions transform to 0,0,0 and a higher z-index
[09:16:37] <aditsu_> oh, css?
[09:16:55] <shoky> https://jsfiddle.net/vgh1tjm2/1/  ;S
[09:16:59] <decx> yeah, these slide methods were nice years ago, but you dont want that in your life anymore
[09:17:13] <aditsu_> heh
[09:17:28] <taplar> fwiw, i'd recommend more descriptive variables names
[09:18:15] <taplar> let your js minifier take care of making it smaller
[09:18:39] <aditsu_> shoky: um, that's quite weird, you're sliding down the old one to reveal the new one, I want to slide the new one from the top to cover the old one
[09:18:57] <taplar> how come?
[09:19:02] <taplar> visually how is it different?
[09:19:05] <shoky> aditsu_: oh right
[09:19:10] <shoky> it's a bit different
[09:19:34] <taplar> oh, they're all dropping down right now
[09:20:11] <aditsu_> decx: can you help with a fiddle?
[09:20:12] <shoky> aditsu_ well actually in your original fiddle they did the same thing (when in the right direction)
[09:20:36] <decx> i could, but i'd go overboard and you would be super confused
[09:20:49] <decx> "this looks nothing like what i had"
[09:21:01] <aditsu_> shoky: yeah, that part is not right
[09:21:20] <shoky> yea, slide functions aren't too great ;p
[09:21:38] <aditsu_> decx: haha, you can't stop yourself? :p
[09:22:09] <decx> yeah i'd create the nav from content elements and all that jazz
[09:22:18] <decx> none of that hardcode shenanigans
[09:22:40] <aditsu_> decx: anyway, then please elaborate on the "0,0,0" thing
[09:22:53] <decx> translate3d(0,0,0)
[09:30:17] <aditsu_> decx: why not translateY?
[09:32:19] <decx> probably doesnt matter anymore
[09:32:36] <decx> only 3d used to create a new layer that is gpu accelerated
[09:33:36] <Cork> translate3d() used to be used to indicate the same thing as the new will-change: property
[09:33:46] <Cork> (except less specific)
[09:33:56] <decx> it was a hack, let's be honest ^^
[09:34:02] <Cork> it was
[09:34:23] <Cork> basically it told the browser "this element is going to animate so optimize for that" basically
[09:34:42] <taplar> basically
[09:35:05] <aditsu_> :o
[09:35:10] <taplar> like, basically
[09:35:25] <Cork> basically, like basically ya :)
[09:35:42] <decx> what about acidally tho
[09:36:08] <taplar> had a guy in the office that made it a point to repeat basically when he heard it said.  actually made some people rethink before they talked
[09:36:55] <decx> maybe it's a hint to expand peoples vocabulary
[09:37:01] <decx> "use essentially once in a while"
[09:38:03] <decx> i learned a great new expression the other day
[09:38:15] <decx> instead of "there it is" you say "and bob's your uncle"
[09:38:21] <taplar> :)
[09:38:32] <Cork> lol
[09:38:42] <taplar> i'm still a fan of "boom goes the dynamite"
[09:39:46] <taplar> shortened usually to just 'boom'
[09:40:12] <taplar> boom boom boom!  now everybody say hey yah  *echo* hey yah!
[09:40:16] <taplar> what song was that...
[09:41:11] <taplar> let me hear you say wayo?  wtf is wayo?  i've been saying it wrong this whole time
[09:42:11] <aditsu_> decx: so anyway, back to css, what should be the "hidden" styling so that it slides down when I make it active?
[09:45:02] <aditsu_> hm, let me try something..
[09:53:43] <aditsu_> so I got some half-css animation working, but the divs are always visible..
[10:00:17] <decx> you can do it
[10:00:25] <decx> when you're done we can compare
[10:00:36] <decx> with the thing i wrote 30 mins ago
[10:01:56] <aditsu_> yeah.. it might take me 30 hours :p
[10:02:50] <decx> only the first time
[10:05:34] <Uhkis> decx: show it!
[10:05:51] <decx> and hinder the learning process? pfft
[10:06:02] <Uhkis> pm!
[10:06:24] <decx> whatevs
[10:06:25] <decx> https://jsfiddle.net/decx/vgh1tjm2/2/
[10:10:09] <Uhkis> bojojoing
[10:10:46] <decx> maybe a little less springy would suffice but i just copied bounceInUp from animate css
[10:11:06] <aditsu_> oh, wat is dat x_x
[10:12:00] <Uhkis> decx: it's great!
[10:12:19] <decx> it's a little rough around the edges
[10:12:22] <decx> but then again, so am i
[10:13:56] <aditsu_> hmm, I figured it involved some position tricks
[10:14:26] <decx> yeah that comes from your requirement
[10:14:42] <aditsu_> but I'd also like to be able to hide (toggle) the current div
[10:14:43] <decx> typically i'd have them all under each other and just transform to the right position
[10:14:47] <decx> like a wheel
[10:15:13] <Uhkis> fixed! https://jsfiddle.net/vgh1tjm2/3/ :D
[10:16:02] <Uhkis> smoothened those edges right up! :D
[10:16:08] <decx> hehe
[10:26:34] <aditsu_> hrm, fixed height?
[10:33:44] <kegster> how can i get the previous value of a select dropdown that was created after the dom loaded?
[10:34:55] <relipse> IS there a reason $(this).attr('action', NEW_URL) only works in chrome, but not in firefox
[10:35:16] <relipse> on submit()
[10:35:35] <relipse> in ff, it submits the form as normal, in chrome it changes the action and then submits
[10:35:37] <relipse> bit difference
[10:37:18] <relipse> I even tried window.location.href = NEW_URL but on firefox it submits before it changes the location.href
[10:38:04] <relipse> nevermind window.location.href seems to work
[10:46:54] <decx> kegster: there's a defaultSelected property
[10:48:34] <aditsu_> oh great, I can't do transition with position :/
[10:57:07] <relipse> is anyone here good with fancybox? I'm trying to wrap an anchor link around the pop up image
[11:02:31] <decx> use the inline-content method
[11:14:20] <aditsu_> oh well, I have to call it a day
[11:14:49] <aditsu_> I'll figure it out later..
[11:33:40] <z1haze_work> I'm getting an unexpected result after pushing some code to production. during an ajax form submit i am seeing was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure XMLHttpRequest endpoint 'http://www.katvondbeauty.com/'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.
[11:33:58] <z1haze_work> Any ideas on how I could fix this?
[11:34:09] <z1haze_work> the page is secure https, and the endpoint is https
[11:34:47] <Uhkis> clearly it's not
[11:35:19] <z1haze_work> yea clearly lol
[11:35:24] <z1haze_work> but the form shows it is
[11:35:54] <z1haze_work> how can i confirm this
[11:36:16] <Uhkis> showing some source helps
[11:36:19] <z1haze_work> its posting to an https location
[11:36:28] <z1haze_work> what would you like to see
[11:36:47] <Uhkis> puppies!
[11:37:00] <z1haze_work> You're a gem arent you
[11:37:07] <Uhkis> but ill settle for the code
[11:37:47] <z1haze_work> http://dpaste.com/3Y4KD7W
[11:39:14] <Uhkis> and the live html for the form?=
[11:43:09] <z1haze_work> the endpoint?
[11:43:21] <z1haze_work> https://production-web-kendo.demandware.net/on/demandware.store/Sites-KVD-Site/default/Newsletter-SignupMJB is the page
[11:43:25] <z1haze_work> ah ffs
[11:43:59] <z1haze_work> https://www.katvondbeauty.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-KVD-Site/default/Newsletter-SignupMJB
[11:44:02] <z1haze_work> there
[11:52:49] <jquery456> hello
[11:52:59] <jquery456> how come i cant make a switch case like this?
[11:53:12] <jquery456> https://jsfiddle.net/86gfswy2/
[11:57:16] <z1haze_work> what do you mean why can't you
[11:58:39] <z1haze_work> callNumAndNote.indexOf("Confirmed")>0 will return a boolean
[11:58:54] <z1haze_work> so you are comparing if callNumAndNote = true ?
[12:00:20] <z1haze_work> you could always do switch(true) { case (callNuMAndNote.indexOf('Confirmed')>0): apiNode = 'confirmed'; break;
[12:00:51] <decx> then you'd have to make sure to change your string cases too
[12:01:09] <z1haze_work> yep
[12:01:12] <decx> ie callNumAndNot === 'casestring'
[12:08:20] <shoky> z1haze_work: not seeing that error on submit. fixed?
[12:09:17] <jquery456> i mean it is not allowed
[12:09:52] <jquery456> https://repl.it/CtQV
[12:12:40] <shoky> jquery456: because it's not allowed :) case values should only be literal values, and it has to be fully equal. you're passing a boolean instead of the value..
[12:12:57] <shoky> just use if :|
[12:17:23] <z1haze_work> hey shoky, no my issue still stands
[12:18:11] <shoky> z1haze_work welp i'm not getting that error
[12:19:34] <z1haze_work> really? hmm let me check
[12:20:03] <z1haze_work> seems its working
[12:20:33] <z1haze_work> thats really strange
[12:53:47] <tona_> hello guys
[12:54:24] <tona_> i am using this code to handle tabs $(document).ready(function() {      $('#tabs li a:not(:first)').addClass('inactive'); $('.container').hide(); $('.container:first').show();      $('#tabs li a').click(function(){     	var t = $(this).attr('id');    	     	if($(this).hasClass('inactive')){ //this is the start of our condition      		$('#tabs li a').addClass('inactive');                		$(this).removeClass('inactive');         		$('.co
[12:54:44] <tona_> how could i handle tabs using url parameter ?
[12:55:33] <tona> hello guys
[12:55:48] <tona> how could i handle tabs and handle it using the url :) ?
[13:01:42] <Uhkis> tona: never paste code to irc, use jsfiddle.net
[13:02:00] <tona> ok let me paste it
[13:03:43] <tona> https://jsfiddle.net/4fdd4jrw/ how could i handle the tabs by URL ?
[13:03:44] <tona> :)
[13:06:35] <Uhkis> by url?
[13:06:57] <taplar> i'm assuming user coming to the page with the #tab2 or whatever in the url
[13:07:44] <z1haze_work> he wants to have a certain tab open if a user goes to a url
[13:07:51] <z1haze_work> yea
[13:08:01] <Uhkis> ah
[13:08:46] <taplar> i forget if window.location.hash includes parameters, but it should include the hash if there is one
[13:09:00] <z1haze_work> doesnt jquery have a url().param('var') thing/
[13:09:17] <z1haze_work> ah no thats a plugin
[13:09:47] <z1haze_work> tona: maybe grab this it would make it easy https://github.com/medialize/URI.js
[13:09:48] <tona> taplar yes i need to move the tabs byurl like parameter
[13:10:07] <taplar> yeah so try using window.location.hash and see what you can come up with
[13:10:32] <Uhkis> tona: https://jsfiddle.net/4fdd4jrw/1/ something like that should work
[13:10:54] <z1haze_work> lol the tabs dont even work on that fiddle
[13:11:45] <Uhkis> z1haze_work: huh?
[13:11:50] <tona> it is not chaningin , still frozen
[13:11:51] <tona> :(
[13:11:57] <tona> Uhkis
[13:14:03] <taplar> so play around with it
[13:14:35] <taplar> we're here to teach and give pointers, not provide solutions yo, :P
[13:14:57] <Uhkis> tona: https://jsfiddle.net/4fdd4jrw/4/ try this one
[13:16:23] <tona> how could i put the url to change the tabs ?
[13:16:37] <Uhkis> like url.com/page#tab1
[13:16:59] <tona> a ok i get it :)
[13:17:05] <tona> thanks Uhkis
[13:18:41] <Uhkis> np
[13:20:54] <taplar> got me curious now
[13:23:59] <taplar> bah, hashes and jsfiddle blow, :)
[13:24:54] <taplar> i was wondering if a hash causes the element it would scroll to to have a focus event
[13:26:57] <tona> not work https://jsfiddle.net/4fdd4jrw/4/page/#tab3  , Uhkis could you explain me what does query mean ? if (hash) { 	$('#tabs li a #' + query).trigger('click'); }
[13:27:14] <Uhkis> wait what
[13:27:42] <Uhkis> tona: https://jsfiddle.net/4fdd4jrw/5/
[13:28:56] <taplar> i believe location.hash includes the # in it
[13:29:12] <tona> i used it no work no yet :( still the same current tab
[13:29:41] <taplar> tona your going to have a hard time testing that one jsfiddle because of how it does the iframes for the different areas
[13:29:54] <taplar> most likely going to have to put it on a real page
[13:30:38] <tona> ok just one comment more , i dont underyand this part var hash = window.location.hash; if (hash) { 	$('#tabs li a #' + hash).trigger('click'); }
[13:30:50] <tona> just to clear it :) i will appreciate
[13:31:06] <taplar> window.location.hash is your "#tab2" in your url
[13:31:22] <taplar> which may or may not also include the parameter string, i forget
[13:31:29] <taplar> if it does you'd have to clean it
[13:31:50] <tona> ok
[14:03:10] <mleary> I’m using jquery.ajax with a checkbox to post data…  the data successfully posts, but now I want to toggle the state of the checkbox on success.  I tried puting this.checked = !this.checked in the success param but it doesnt do anything (or maybe it does but then goes back to original state), what am i missing/
[14:07:59] <z1haze_work> you can use is
[14:09:16] <z1haze_work> $('input[type=checkbox]:checked').length
[14:09:52] <z1haze_work> $(el).is(':checked')
[14:10:57] <mleary> what i’m confused about is if I add an alert() to the success function I can see the checkbox toggle but as soon as I dismiss the dialog it reverts
[14:14:51] <z1haze_work> make a fiddle

[18:50:42] <robertmaxrees> more like my dad passed away march 2015 and then my wife's dad passed away this past may.
[18:50:56] <robertmaxrees> plus a whole smattering of other stuff on top of that.

[18:51:59] <ryanneufeld> sorry to hear that
[18:52:13] <robertmaxrees> it's been par for the course during our marriage tbh.
[18:52:18] <robertmaxrees> just one thing after another.
[18:52:27] <ryanneufeld> that's life bruh
[18:52:48] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: Where you from? Chino right?
[18:52:51] <robertmaxrees> chico
[18:53:16] <robertmaxrees> and those are just 2 of the things that've happened.  lots more family drama and stuff surrounding those (and other) events.
[18:53:44] <Darmani> Well you can pm me anytime bruhh. More than happy to lend an ear.
[18:53:55] <robertmaxrees> i appreciate it.  I'm just looking for a break.
[18:54:04] <robertmaxrees> though now my wife wants to buy another house.
[18:54:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:54:16] <Darmani> what does she do?
[18:54:43] <robertmaxrees> she's the administrator for the largest vet hospital in northern CA.
[18:55:11] <Darmani> oh shit thats cool.
[18:55:24] <Darmani> she sounds like top dog
[18:55:29] <Darmani> see what I did there?
[18:55:35] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:55:41] <Darmani> xP
[18:55:45] <robertmaxrees> it's super challenging but it's been a good learning experience.
[18:56:03] <Darmani> it's all a learning curve man.
[18:56:18] <robertmaxrees> the stuff she's been dealing with hasn't been learning curve related.
[18:56:29] <robertmaxrees> she was basically doing the job for about 2 years before being given the title.
[18:56:33] <robertmaxrees> it's employee stuff.
[18:56:56] <Darmani> ahh so it's not all sunshine and rainbows in the land of vet hospitals?
[18:56:58] <Darmani> le gasp
[18:57:20] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:58:37] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: I thought you were in Chino so I was like hell yeah man I'll drive over and get you a beer.
[18:58:45] <Darmani> Then I looked up where "Chico" is.
[18:58:47] <Darmani> lol
[18:58:50] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[18:58:56] <robertmaxrees> totally different side of the state.
[18:59:05] <Darmani> I've never been that far north hahaha
[21:01:03] <user_corrupt> I have a div with id of #main_poll_image and when I try to do      $("#main_poll_image").css("display", "none");    then nothing happens... here is the output if I type that into console: n.fn.init {context: document, selector: "#main_poll_image"}
[21:04:17] <jsum> very little information
[21:10:23] <user_corrupt> #main-poll-image was the actual id
[21:12:44] <jsum> including the # ?
[21:12:53] <jsum> oh, you made wrong the id?
[21:15:07] <arc_> user_corrupt are you saying you did id="#main_poll_image"
[21:17:49] <user_corrupt> $("#main-poll-image").css("display", "none");      is what I'm using now.. my mistake was using underscores
