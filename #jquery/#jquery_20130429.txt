[00:00:02] <tw2113> before they even began
[00:00:07] <foofoobar> coldhead, thanks, I will get it working from here
[00:00:36] <coldhead> godspeed, foofoobar
[00:00:39] <coldhead> you were one of the best
[00:00:52] <help222> and i, one of the worst
[00:01:01] <foofoobar> I know, I know..
[00:01:02] <tw2113> don't be a helpy downer help222
[00:01:03] <coldhead> you have my pity
[00:01:33] <help222> how do i talk in whisper mode or whatever. (red type)
[00:01:44] <r500> http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/how-to-use-the-jquery-ui-autocomplete-widget/ i tried to download and check if it is working. but no  success if i use   $.getJSON("./friends.php?callback=?", req, function(data) {      but                   //this works $.getJSON("http://www.danwellman.co.uk/de...", req, function(data) {
[00:01:54] <coldhead> don't bother, help222
[00:01:56] <coldhead> just let it all out
[00:02:06] <coldhead> let it all unravel, it can be a path on which to travel
[00:02:09] <help222> i regret naming myself this
[00:02:10] <coldhead> apologies m. leunig
[00:02:13] <Cork> help222: there isn't a wisper on irc
[00:02:34] <Cork> help222: anyway another lamp worth looking at is http://www.server2go-web.de/index.html
[00:02:40] <Cork> it's the one i used WAY back
[00:02:53] <Cork> (when i was still on windows)
[00:03:16] * coldhead wipes away nostalgic tears
[00:03:51] * tw2113 puts them back on
[00:04:57] <help222> which one do you want me to download cork
[00:05:22] <help222> btw cold, why didnt that 'alert' work for me?
[00:06:25] <Cork> help222: i don't want you to download either; it was recommendations for a more predictable development environment
[00:06:36] <Cork> help222: and two examples that would make it fairly easy
[00:06:54] <Cork> help222: it's up to you to pick how you want to set up your IDE
[00:08:21] <coldhead> help222: it didn't load because javascript is looking for the file in the wrong place
[00:08:37] <coldhead> your debugger probably has an ugly red 404 entry in the Network tab
[00:08:55] <coldhead> Cork: wanna just get him inline his script and make the file location problem go away? :D
[00:09:35] <Cork> no
[00:09:43] <coldhead>  so pious and moral
[00:09:57] <Cork> cause that would just moved the problem down the road
[00:10:09] <help222> matrix...
[00:10:28] <coldhead> down the road, i'll be asleep!
[00:10:40] <help222> sleep does not exist
[00:10:44] <help222> :(
[00:11:07] <coldhead> i can hear it calling to me
[00:11:12] <coldhead> it sounds pretty real
[00:11:22] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[00:11:27] <help222> it is saying "stay away.. stay awayyyyy"
[00:13:57] <coldhead> it's saying "they don't understand you. i'm the only one who will ever love you. be with me"
[00:14:28] <help222> so is my computer just broken or am i just putting something in the wrong place...
[00:15:33] <mazzachre> Is it in any way possible to get the script tag that the current code is running in?!
[00:15:42] <coldhead> you're not properly set up for web dev, help222
[00:15:50] <coldhead> both in terms of software and in terms of your experience
[00:16:09] <help222> well i have no choice in the matter
[00:16:31] <help222> i would very gladly not do this if i had a choice at all
[00:16:39] <coldhead> that's part of the problem
[00:16:46] <coldhead> you have to WANT to succeed
[00:16:53] <Cork> mazzachre: document.write is the only code that know where in the dom it came from
[00:16:57] <Cork> mazzachre: so; no
[00:16:57] <coldhead> you have to ENFLAME yourself with desire
[00:17:02] <coldhead> like before cunninlingus
[00:17:22] <Cork> mazzachre: as document.write will utterly destroy your page if you use it
[00:17:38] <help222> lol
[00:18:41] <help222> i have a need, which is what is fueling my 'desire' to fix this stuff but i do not 'want' it like you want it
[00:19:13] <coldhead> i no longer want it, i just don't have the strength to DO anything else
[00:19:21] <help222> lol
[00:19:30] <coldhead> what i want is a pint of cognac
[00:19:37] <coldhead> and an erotic puppet show
[00:19:39] <Cork> help222: this is the reason why i suggested using a lamp or similar server: browsers has a lot of extra restrictions on files loaded from the local drive
[00:19:40] <coldhead> but it's not going to happen
[00:19:52] <Cork> also you don't have headers, and the correct url format
[00:20:07] <Cork> so you can't develop a site that is easy and safe to publish later
[00:20:10] <help222> i didn't link that bit
[00:20:17] <Cork> all this is solved by using a development server
[00:20:38] <help222> ok well how hard is it to figure out and does it cost anything
[00:20:43] <Cork> and wamp and similar is how to solve this easiest
[00:20:55] <tw2113> WAMP = free
[00:20:59] <coldhead> poor Cork
[00:21:03] <Cork> help222: server to go is a download click to start
[00:21:08] <Cork> and it just works
[00:21:57] <fabioportieri> sorry cork i just entered the conversation.. for what did you suggest lamp/wamp ?
[00:22:12] <Cork> fabioportieri: development server
[00:22:23] <Cork> instead of running on local drive
[00:23:39] <fabioportieri> ok, thanks
[00:23:49] <help222> ...
[00:24:11] <help222> this stuff makes me feel bad -_-
[00:24:37] <help222> if i ever get this stuff fixed i still have to do action script stuff for flash..
[00:24:44] <tw2113> eww
[00:24:47] <tw2113> flash
[00:25:04] <help222> i have no idea how to do that stuff either :D
[00:25:07] <Cork> help222: why do you need flash?
[00:25:21] <help222> different project corky
[00:25:24] <help222> cork*
[00:25:28] <Cork> ah
[00:25:35] <tw2113> pass on it
[00:25:40] <tw2113> flash isn't worth the money
[00:25:43] <Cork> so convert it to svg+js+canvas :)
[00:26:34] <help222> i am tasked with making an action script 3 flash game thing and if i don't make it I fail my class and move into a ditch and pray to die
[00:26:58] <help222> lar lar lar life...
[00:27:06] <Cork> ...
[00:27:11] <tw2113> your high school/college still teaches flash?
[00:27:24] <tw2113> transfer, tomorrow
[00:27:29] <Cork> struggling to keep up with the 1990's i see
[00:28:08] <help222> is it that old?
[00:28:22] <Cork> html can do most/all of it today
[00:28:22] <tw2113> it's like bellbottoms
[00:28:22] <help222> Adobe Flash AS3 stuff
[00:28:26] <help222> i thought that was new?
[00:28:26] <Cork> except for video streaming
[00:28:49] <tw2113> any games you should be doing for classes are for smartphones, if they want to teach useful skills
[00:29:08] <help222> it is just supposed to expose us to it i think
[00:29:15] <help222> none of my classes really teach anything
[00:29:26] <help222> we just go over something for a week or so and move on
[00:29:29] <tw2113> and you're paying to not be taught
[00:29:43] <help222> it is what i am expected to do
[00:29:50] <help222> fun times
[00:30:03] <tw2113> *headdesk*
[00:30:10] <help222> my teachers have said if we want to learn anything to just google it
[00:30:13] <help222> so i am
[00:30:34] <tw2113> if they're not helping AT ALL and just saying google it to any question
[00:30:37] <tw2113> they suck
[00:30:38] <Cork> help222: your teacher is a bad one
[00:30:46] <help222> teachers*
[00:31:11] <Cork> as just google without knowing what the other party knows about what they talk about won't teach you how to do it well
[00:31:15] <help222> meh well it is only google it if you ask a question
[00:31:15] <Cork> just how to hack it
[00:32:03] <Cork> and most of the answers you find on the net needs to be checked so they work today
[00:32:12] <tw2113> they should be helping you the best they can to answer the specific questions
[00:32:16] <Cork> as the info moves much slower then the actual industry
[00:32:23] <tw2113> but at least they should be teaching you how to analyze and break down problems
[00:33:09] <Cork> and what kind of sources to trust, and witch to stay aways from (like w3schools)
[00:33:51] <help222> w3schools is the main source for where we are supposed to get info from
[00:34:08] <Cork> help222: and you will learn a lot of lies and half truths
[00:34:45] <Cork> the web would be a better place if that domain was shutdown
[00:34:51] <Cork> (or redirected)
[00:34:51] <help222> lol
[00:35:08] <help222> i cannot download this lamp thing
[00:35:16] <coldhead> case in point: everything i know i learned from w3schools and i am basically useless
[00:35:26] <Cork> lol
[00:35:27] <tw2113> ?mdn
[00:35:34] <tw2113> bah
[00:35:36] <tw2113> ?g mdn
[00:35:36] <b-ot> tw2113: Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/
[00:35:40] <Cork> tw2113: its ?mdc
[00:35:41] <tw2113> much better resource
[00:36:05] <tw2113> what's that other web documentation place that launched in the past year
[00:36:08] <help222> and we re-enter the matrix
[00:36:13] <Cork> ?g opera introduction web standards
[00:36:13] <b-ot> Cork: 1: Introduction to The Web Standards Curriculum/Table of ... - Opera → http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/1-introduction-to-the-web-standards-cur/
[00:36:25] <tw2113> web something
[00:37:13] <coldhead> http://www.webplatform.org/
[00:37:26] <Cork> help222: basically my recommendations as soon as you search for something related to the web include a -site:w3scholls.com
[00:37:30] <tw2113> that's it
[00:37:33] <tw2113> one day i may remember that
[00:37:40] <coldhead> i forget every time
[00:37:50] <coldhead> have to look up the last time i looked it up to find the name again
[00:37:51] <Cork> tw2113: that one is new to me
[00:38:00] <Qbix1> hey guys
[00:38:02] <Qbix1> question
[00:38:08] <coldhead> shoot
[00:38:16] <tw2113> *dies*
[00:38:17] <Cork> tw2113: have you checked through the quality of the page?
[00:38:21] <Qbix1> I have a strange question
[00:38:29] <Qbix1> but an important one
[00:38:31] <Qbix1> it goes like this:
[00:38:38] <tw2113> not really Cork, i still prefer MDN
[00:38:54] <Cork> tw2113: then i would say don't recommend something you haven't verified is good
[00:38:57] <Cork> :s
[00:38:57] <Qbix1> I have a jquery plugin that does a few DOM manipulations and then attaches some events
[00:39:09] <Qbix1> the problem is when an element gets removed from the DOM, then gets added back in, and my plugin gets applied again
[00:39:13] <aschwab> hello, i still got a problem with my slideUp/slideDown animation queue, i want to trigger it just when its finished, is there a best practice?
[00:39:20] <Qbix1> how can I get the events to be added again?
[00:39:28] <tw2113> Cork, given the big names behind it and what i've heard OF the project, i'm sure it'll be a quality resource in time
[00:39:55] <Qbix1> I tried doing $(document).on(myevent, myelement) hoping that the event handler will stick around, but that seems to make the event fire on ALL instances of the plugin now :(
[00:39:57] <Cork> Qbix1: as long as the original dom element isn't destroyed the event should still be there
[00:40:09] <tw2113> W3C, adobe, facebook, google, hp, intel, microsoft, mozilla, nokia, opera
[00:40:25] <Qbix1> It's removed from the DOM and then added back in, and the event is no longer firing
[00:40:28] <Cork> tw2113: well i still wouldn'
[00:40:34] <Cork> 't recommend something i haven't checked
[00:40:36] <Qbix1> I thought that was the expected behavior
[00:40:36] <tw2113> :P
[00:40:53] <Qbix1> events aren't reattached when element is inserted into dom again, right?
[00:40:54] <Cork> Qbix1: by removing are you talking removing and parsing html again?
[00:41:21] <Qbix1> not sure what you mean by parsing HTML again,
[00:41:24] <Qbix1> I remove it with .remove()
[00:41:26] <Cork> or are you talking about detaching the dom element and reataching?
[00:41:30] <Qbix1> then add it back in with .append()
[00:41:36] <Cork> from a string?
[00:41:46] <tw2113> to be fair Cork i didn't recommend it, i just suddenly remembered it :D
[00:41:52] <help222> oh i should get one of you guys to skype with me and view my desktop and tell me all about how stupid i am while fixing my life
[00:41:53] <Qbix1> hmm I suppose so, yeah
[00:42:09] <Cork> Qbix1: ok, html can't hold references to event listeners
[00:42:14] <Qbix1> if I attach an event handler to an element, remove it from the dom and append it back, what hpapens?
[00:42:18] <Cork> Qbix1: so you're basically throwing them away
[00:42:21] <Qbix1> event handler is detached right?
[00:42:26] <Qbix1> and I have to reattach again?
[00:42:31] <Cork> Qbix1: your not appending it back
[00:42:36] <Qbix1> no?
[00:42:37] <Cork> your removing it, and creates a set of new ones
[00:42:44] <Qbix1> what creates the new set?
[00:42:54] <Cork> append('html string')
[00:43:05] <Qbix1> oh, hmm
[00:43:10] <Qbix1> I don't do THAT, sec let me check
[00:43:15] <seutje> morning Cork!
[00:43:17] <Qbix1> but in the case I added that *element* back
[00:43:24] <Qbix1> would the event listener be still attached?
[00:43:27] <Qbix1> and actually work?
[00:43:41] <Qbix1> does removing an element from the dom DETACH the listeners basically
[00:43:49] <Cork> Qbix1: var cache = $('selector'); cache.remove(); /* later */ $(parent).append(cache); will use the same dom elements
[00:44:14] <Qbix1> and event listener isn't detached, correct?
[00:44:22] <Cork> uh
[00:44:28] <Cork> even listeners live on the dom element
[00:44:31] <Qbix1> gotcha
[00:44:35] <Qbix1> okay :) just making sure
[00:44:40] <Cork> as long as you keep a reference to the dom element the event lives
[00:44:46] <Qbix1> nice!
[00:44:53] <Cork> if you throw the reference away gc will destroy it
[00:45:04] <Cork> and a new set from html has no relation to them
[00:45:13] <Qbix1> what is best practice for plugins to not re-create themselves again
[00:45:18] <Qbix1> if the plugin is called twice on same element?
[00:45:33] <Qbix1> should I save .data("plugin-name", true) on each element in .each ?
[00:45:43] <Cork> for example yes
[00:45:59] <Cork> there is a lot of ways to do it, but that is one as good as any
[00:45:59] <Qbix1> ok ? but here is anothe rquestion
[00:46:05] <Qbix1> .data( ) is lost when element is removed! right?
[00:46:13] <Qbix1> and then reattached into DOM?
[00:46:20] <Qbix1> how does .data work exactly?
[00:46:30] <Qbix1> has some kind of closure with key into data array?
[00:46:34] <Cork> not as long as the dom element is keept alive
[00:47:05] <help222> i don't understand what server2go is supposed to be doing for me
[00:47:08] <help222> downloaded it
[00:47:08] <Cork> Qbix1: .data works by jquery having an internal object, this object uses a reference jquery sets on the dom element
[00:47:23] <help222> opened the .exe and it opened a ie browser
[00:47:32] <coldhead> i don't understand why you want to remove and reinsert elements from the DOM
[00:47:37] <Cork> Qbix1: jquery then basically uses the dom element as a key in the object
[00:47:55] <Cork> ya, normally just .hide() is the best way to do it
[00:48:56] <help222> ._.
[00:49:04] <Cork> help222: https://bitbucket.org/thaberkern/server2go/wiki/Documentation
[00:49:27] <Cork> but i think there should be a simpler one around
[00:50:21] <Qbix1> how can one use a dom element (an object) as a key?
[00:50:28] <Qbix1> jquery creates a unique string?
[00:50:32] <Cork> yes
[00:50:55] <Qbix1> gotcha.
[00:51:14] <Qbix1> so then my code must have a bug, because .data( ) gets lost
[00:51:19] <Qbix1> when I append again
[00:51:59] <Qbix1> oh wait, it somehow owrks now :)
[00:52:02] <Qbix1> I must have undid the bug
[00:52:02] <Cork> yes, cause you use html
[00:52:04] <tw2113> store it in a variable
[00:52:08] <Cork> html != dom
[00:52:18] <coldhead> -_-
[00:52:20] <Qbix1> well I know what you're saying, but that's not what I was doing
[00:52:23] <Qbix1> anyway, it works now :)
[00:52:31] <Qbix1> want to see the coolness? I will upload just to show it
[00:52:41] <hxm> hello! i have this http://jsfiddle.net/qFd5h/ but what i want is, the flip switches at the top-right
[00:52:49] <hxm> where do i fail
[00:54:14] <Cork> Qbix1: what jquery is doing is element[jQuery.expando] = jQuery.guid++;
[00:54:41] <Cork> and then cache[element[jQuery.expando]] to grab the data
[00:55:06] <Cork> (had to dig up the actual variable names as i never remember them...)
[00:56:19] <seutje> hxm: like http://jsfiddle.net/qFd5h/1/ ?
[00:56:46] <Qbix1> ah, very nice
[00:57:00] <Qbix1> there's a nice site for annotated jquery code I think
[00:57:44] <hxm> seutje: pretty nice, thanks - ui-slider-switch is in the .css file, you altered it, is it?
[00:57:53] <coldhead> help222: having a server running on your local machine will help it "act" more like an actual server, so when you upload the stuff to the Real Thing it shoudl just work
[00:57:54] <seutje> yea
[00:58:10] <seutje> hxm: added a float right and a clearfix on the wrapper
[00:58:10] <coldhead> if you can get your machine to act like a server then the rest of your dev life should be simpler
[00:58:29] <coldhead> if you really can't make it go then forget about it, and get set to solve problems twice: locally and then again in production
[00:58:38] <seutje> coldhead: and then protocol agnostic links won't break :D
[00:58:50] <coldhead> we are way past caring about that, seutje
[00:58:55] <coldhead> THE MAN IS IN TEARS
[00:59:03] <coldhead> HE JUST WANTS AN IMAGE GALLERY, FFS
[00:59:21] <seutje> don't we all?
[00:59:25] <help222> this is the last web site i ever want to make and i just want the damn thing to work... sigh
[00:59:49] <coldhead> have you considered outsourcing it to india?
[00:59:53] <coldhead> that's a popular option
[00:59:56] <Cork> lol
[00:59:57] <help222> if i had the money
[01:01:16] <help222> cork: is there a way to fix my problem without using the server2go or anything similar
[01:01:24] <Cork> help222: yes
[01:01:27] <help222> i have no idea how you guys are doing the red type
[01:01:38] <Cork> but then you need to provide the information requested
[01:01:53] <Cork> help222: it's your client doing it
[01:02:04] <Cork> it's called nick highlighting
[01:02:36] <help222> cork: so is my type red right now for you?
[01:02:43] <Cork> yes
[01:02:47] <help222> oh good
[01:02:55] <help222> well thats the best news i have heard all night
[01:03:00] <Cork> (or what ever color i choose to have for it)
[01:03:04] <Cork> ...
[01:03:44] <Cork> help222: the wamp was mostly cause it makes making sure that what you're doing will work a heck a lot easier
[01:04:16] <help222> i have the .js files that i need (i think) but dreamweeaver keeps saying "
[01:04:17] <Cork> without it you can still make a working web page, but you will be forced to do things in special ways
[01:04:24] <Cork> as the browser will block you otherwise
[01:04:27] <help222> 'file' is not on the local dis. Get
[01:04:54] <Cork> help222: with the restrictions you have the simplest solution is to just put the file right beside the html one
[01:05:05] <help222> ok
[01:05:06] <help222> brb
[01:05:09] <Cork> as you can't really have a script folder (browser will block the loading)
[01:06:25] <help222> ok all my .js files are in the same folder as my .html
[01:07:06] <help222> omg there is something on my page
[01:07:06] <Cork> and then have a <script type="text/javascript" src="name-of-script-file.js"></script>
[01:07:07] <help222> yay
[01:07:33] <help222> yea i have that already, my js just would not work
[01:07:37] <Cork> help222: but as soon as you can you should have someone help you set up a wamp or similar server for you
[01:07:51] <Cork> help222: yes, cause you load it from a local path
[01:08:02] <Cork> and browsers has a lot of extra restrictions there
[01:08:03] <help222> if i can get through this class i am never touching this stuff again
[01:08:12] <Cork> help222: why?
[01:08:24] <Cork> just cause you need a server to run the page on?
[01:08:24] <help222> i don't plan to ever do anything with this stuff
[01:08:51] <Cork> help222: well... then you will have a quite tough time finding job
[01:09:06] <sacho> help222, why are you studying the class then?
[01:09:08] <Cork> cause most every programing job there is will touch html+js in one way or another
[01:09:15] <help222> i don't plan on doing anything that would require the web
[01:09:30] <help222> sacho: was forced to take it
[01:09:32] <Cork> help222: so you're going to do what?
[01:09:36] <sacho> forced?
[01:09:39] <sacho> are you indentured?
[01:09:42] <help222> family
[01:10:12] <help222> i am going to work at whatever low level job i can find and do that for however long
[01:10:12] <sacho> so why not talk to your family instead of half-assing it
[01:10:18] <Cork> help222: you won't even be able to do server coding (as most of the servers now days have a web interface for config)
[01:10:39] <Cork> help222: and most all low level jobs still have a web interface
[01:11:00] <help222> huh? i am talking about minimum wage jobs
[01:11:03] <Cork> except if you talk about REALLY deep things like chips for controlling lamps and so on (c++)
[01:11:07] <help222> grocery stores etc
[01:11:19] <sacho> help222, you don't plan to program at all?
[01:11:23] <help222> no
[01:11:26] <sacho> ah, ok then.
[01:11:29] <Cork> help222: will most guaranteed still be intranet dependent
[01:11:43] <sacho> ALthough the way things are going, programming is probably going to become a common skill, like driving
[01:11:50] <sacho> in a generation or two..
[01:11:50] <help222> i think i can stock boxes without a worry
[01:12:08] <Cork> ah
[01:12:13] <help222> but until then I still have to make this stuff work
[01:12:21] <Cork> you mean don't do development at all...
[01:12:25] <help222> yes
[01:12:26] <seutje> the fact that you found ur way in here would suggest ur destined for greater things
[01:12:27] <Cork> didn't catch that...
[01:12:35] <help222> none at all
[01:13:01] <help222> I asked google for jquery chat rooms and bam
[01:13:15] <seutje> u'd be surprised how many ppl fail at googling
[01:13:32] <help222> i know this all too well
[01:13:46] <help222> all i want is to work a few crappy low paying jobs and be left alone
[01:13:53] <help222> i don't aspire to be anything
[01:14:00] <seutje> my brother did support for a couple years, which was pretty much just full-time googling for ppl :D
[01:14:38] <Qbix1> okay seriously
[01:14:41] <seutje> iono man, it rly helps to get some for of satisfaction from the thing you're spending a large chunk of ur time on
[01:14:46] <seutje> form*
[01:14:49] <Qbix1> when this thing is .remove()d and then appended back (NOT USING A STRING)
[01:14:59] <Qbix1> the .data( ) seems to disappear
[01:15:26] <Cork> Qbix1: can you generate a fiddle of your problem=
[01:15:28] <Cork> *?
[01:15:33] <Qbix1> I can try
[01:15:38] <help222> seutje: i would be dead if people would just leave me alone. I don't care what job I do or how much I get payed.
[01:16:16] <Cork> that's a gloomy prospect if i ever heard one
[01:16:53] <help222> I am doing this stuff atm because I was told to or I would be disowned, which I guess would be fine.. I forget why I am doing this.. lol..
[01:17:13] <Cork> ...
[01:17:32] <Cork> who ever is paying for your study should be mad...
[01:17:49] <Cork> at least try to learn something from it
[01:17:52] <Cork> ...
[01:18:04] <help222> my grandfather who is also the one who made me quit my job and come here
[01:18:54] <seutje> after doing the same boring, unsatisfactory thing for 10+ years, u'll care
[01:19:09] <seutje> Qbix1: deep clone it?
[01:19:13] <Qbix1> what does it mean, server-side ignore
[01:19:18] <Qbix1> it says Cork is in +g mode
[01:19:34] <seutje> it means u shouldn't PM him randomly :P
[01:19:41] <Cork> it means i don't want random /msg's
[01:19:43] <help222> seutje: 4 years counting tills and never gave a damn
[01:19:46] <Qbix1> oh I see
[01:19:50] <seutje> Qbix1:  http://jsfiddle.net/ChWqj/
[01:19:52] <help222> 6 more would mean nothing
[01:19:52] <Qbix1> did you see my /notice? :P
[01:19:57] <help222> 60 more would mean even less
[01:20:31] <seutje> well, enjoy then... I guess
[01:20:39] <Qbix1> http://jsfiddle.net/kmtdE/
[01:20:44] <Qbix1> you see?
[01:20:53] <Qbix1> the .data is gone when you remove it and then appendTo
[01:20:58] <help222> there is no 'joy' in it but whatever
[01:21:14] <Qbix1> I don't know why
[01:21:33] <Qbix1> but it doesn't fit the description you gave me, Cork .. right?
[01:22:05] <mazzachre> Cork: Sry for being away (meeting)... It is all fine, I didn't think I could and I would also be somewhat hesitant to use it if I could, it seems so error prone...
[01:22:45] <Cork> Qbix1: http://jsfiddle.net/kmtdE/2/
[01:22:47] <Qbix1> guys do you see it
[01:22:59] <Qbix1> aha, detach instead of remove?
[01:23:16] <Cork> Qbix1: looks like remove cleans up the data object
[01:23:19] <Qbix1> http://api.jquery.com/detach/ <-- aha
[01:23:23] <Qbix1> so that's what it was!
[01:23:30] <Qbix1> bah, should have read the docs. THANKS :)
[01:23:38] <seutje> yeah, was about to say, deep cloning is silly in this case
[01:23:44] <Qbix1> so simple!
[01:23:45] <Qbix1> :)
[01:23:53] <Qbix1> By the way I tried out join.me and I love it
[01:24:03] <Qbix1> by far the easiest screensharing tool (I am not affiliated with them)
[01:24:50] <Cork> mazzachre: the best solutions is to add a handler element in the dom and use it's id
[01:25:00] <Cork> mazzachre: or even better use it as a container for the content
[01:27:58] <mazzachre> Cork: Ya... well my "problem" is that some users of my library can't be as*ed to both namespace their forms and use that namespace for submitting them... I will survive, the users will have to write about 10 more characters in their code...
[01:28:36] <Cork> mazzachre: there is a few hacky ways you can locate it
[01:29:00] <Cork> mazzachre: $('script').filter(function() { return this.src.match() });
[01:29:37] <Cork> but that only works as long as it's not added to the dom with jquery
[01:31:06] <badcat> i have a complex project and I split it up into a couple of apps for each main task. this works fine so far, but managing the templates becomes more complex and they become quite huge. what is the best practice to keep the app-specific template stuff within the app and stick everything together into the final templates for the project?  template tags? inclusion?
[01:31:15] <mazzachre> Cork: Oh... well... I don't like hacks :) So I will just say it is impossible to do...
[01:31:25] <Cork> lol
[01:31:53] <seutje> this whole business revolves around hacks
[01:32:33] <sacho> badcat, look into how a few of the templating systems(handlebars etc) do template composition
[01:32:57] <badcat> okay
[01:33:41] <Cork> badcat: server templating is the way i would go
[01:33:53] <badcat> oops, sorry I just realized I asking the wrong channel ;)
[01:33:58] <badcat> this was supposed to go to #django
[01:34:01] <Cork> a form of preprocessing solutions (there are plenty out there)
[01:34:03] <badcat> sorry!
[01:34:08] <Cork> lol
[01:34:17] <badcat> for a moment i was like WTF ;)
[01:38:20] <JohnBo> Hello! I have a little problem im not sure how to tackle. http://jsfiddle.net/ztVHz/1/ If you take a look at the code, you see the hires-attribute in the html. Id like to swap the guid in the src-attribute to the hires-attribute-numbers. Could any1 put me in the right direction? Cheers
[01:40:25] <Cork> JohnBo: http://jsfiddle.net/ztVHz/2/
[01:40:31] <Cork> opps
[01:40:41] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/ztVHz/3/
[01:42:41] <JohnBo> Aah, perfect! Is there any way to make it just replace the guid with the hires-attribute? So its usable on every image with the hires-attribute?
[01:42:58] <JohnBo> Cork, sorry if this is simple questions, im still learning!
[01:43:07] <Cork> $('img[data-hires]')
[01:43:21] <Cork> JohnBo: you should NOT add arbittary none prefixed attributes
[01:43:28] <Cork> give it the correct namespace data-
[01:44:23] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/ztVHz/4/
[01:46:00] <JohnBo> Cork, thats awesome, thanks mate! :)
[01:46:09] <JohnBo> And ill change the attribute!

[02:37:53] <lucaszz> Hi
[02:38:01] <lucaszz> I want to declare global variable
[02:38:09] <lucaszz> could you take a look there?
[02:38:10] <lucaszz> http://pastebin.com/3g0Eztp0
[02:38:16] <lucaszz> What Im doing wrong
[02:38:18] <lucaszz> ?
[02:40:27] <Cork> lucaszz: that should work just fine
[02:40:48] <Cork> as long as the global $ and the global jQuery is the same object
[02:42:14] <lucaszz> Variable is inside function ($)
[02:42:25] <Cork> ya, i see
[02:42:37] <Cork> but that redirects to the global jQuery
[02:42:48] <lucaszz> In this case variable can be global or not?
[02:42:50] <lucaszz> ok
[02:42:51] <Cork> (function($) {})(jQuery <--)
[02:43:04] <Cork> jQuery is global
[02:43:14] <Cork> $ is local pointing to the global object
[02:51:51] <Dirkos> How can i get the coords of my mouse when an input if focussed?
[02:52:21] <Cork> Dirkos: you would have to track mousemove event
[02:53:13] <Dirkos> k thnx
[02:54:03] <Dirkos> Cork: is there also a way to determine how far an input field is from the left side of the window? I want to show a popup from the start of the input field (like a dropdown of that input field)
[02:54:24] <Cork> `api offset
[02:54:25] <b-ot> Cork: .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[02:55:32] <Dirkos> ah awesome haha
[02:55:45] <jop008> If I have this FIELDSET<div class="ui-controlgroup-controls"><div class="ui-radio"><input type="radio" what is the fastest way to get to the input radio type?
[02:55:58] <jop008> coming from fieldset element
[02:56:44] <Cork> .find('input[type="radio"]').attr('type')
[02:56:56] <Cork> opps
[02:57:00] <Cork> .find('input').attr('type')
[02:57:04] <jop008> handy find form $ element I guess
[02:57:16] <Cork> $(this).find(
[02:57:22] <jop008> oke thx
[03:01:21] <Ov3rTaf> hey all, ne1 knows a good jquery plug to enable Oauth2 (twitter,FB,G+) authentification easily ?
[03:11:44] <hxm> hi
[03:12:07] <hxm> i have this http://jsfiddle.net/qFd5h/3/ that looks ok but in a mobile enviroment the label is a line and the switch is in a new line
[03:12:18] <hxm> am i doing it wrong using a listview?
[03:14:27] <seutje> hxm: ur labels are only set to display: inline-block; for @media (min-width: 28em)
[03:15:26] <seutje> make label.ui-slider always be inline block and they should appear on the same line if possible (large textcontent will still make it wrap)
[03:20:27] <hxm> seutje: thanks again
[03:22:18] <mpgutta> hi, i am trying JAWS screen reader software, i observed in IE browser JAWS is reading all elements at once on tab key press which is not expected behaviour and it seems jquery ui dialog boxes are read correct one by one on tab key press in FF, Chrome browsers. could anyone please tell me how to handle IE issue?
[03:23:18] <mpgutta> example dialog i used is from this page http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-form "create new user" dialog.
[03:23:48] <CaptainHeavy> Hey guys, I'm trying to load a function when the page I have loads up but I don't think its being called, the code I have is here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/11aa482a8f386082632d
[03:26:49] <CaptainHeavy> am I doing anything obviously wrong?
[03:33:07] <eager> CaptainHeavy: how about errors in there? you won't see anything, if there is an error in there. What does console say?
[03:33:50] <philhutchinson> I'm trying to load json from another site, via $.ajax() - but i'm getting nothing at all
[03:34:01] <philhutchinson> anyone any ideas as to how that should work?
[03:35:42] <CaptainHeavy> eager: you know what, Firefox booted up without the add ons I had and I'd lost Firebug
[03:36:19] <CaptainHeavy> eager: didn't even think to check that! Its telling me there's an illegal character on the final line before the </script> tag
[03:36:22] <eager> CaptainHeavy: try chrome, it has it built in
[03:37:40] <CaptainHeavy> eager: amazing, its working now! Thanks for the heads up :D
[03:37:51] <eager> np :)
[03:38:19] <Cork> eager: side note; so does firefox
[03:40:25] <eager> Cork: you are right :) I tend to forget about that (well, actually I tend to get irritated by it) :D (especially since ctrl+T got mapped to it instead of the reopening the last closed tab)
[03:52:38] <Cork> eager: what has historically annoyed me the most is that the built in console sometimes steals messages from firefox console
[03:53:30] <eager> i don't get it :)
[04:04:48] <seutje> isn't that ctrl+shift+t?
[04:05:10] <seutje> I don't understand why they implemented the 3D view before getting a proper console
[04:05:15] <Cork> that's recently closed
[04:05:26] <Cork> ctrl+t is new tab
[04:05:38] <seutje> yeah, I was referring to "especially since ctrl+T got mapped to it instead of the reopening the last closed tab"
[04:06:00] <Cork> ctrl+t has never been mapped to reopen
[04:06:29] <seutje> exactly
[04:07:28] <seutje> speaking of hijacking keyboard shortcuts, try typing a "?" in chrome's sources tab
[04:08:06] <Cork> heh lovely
[04:08:33] <Cork> well it works as long as the editor is marked though
[04:08:47] <seutje> holy fuck, it's fixed in canary
[04:09:17] <Cork> hmm i'm on 25 so...
[04:09:31] <Cork> been fixed a while i think
[04:09:43] <seutje> my 26 stable still triggers the shortcuts instead
[04:11:24] <Gilchrisht44> Anyone got experience with JQuery Quarantine?
[04:11:54] <Gilchrisht44> https://github.com/quickredfox/jQuery-Quarantine
[04:12:37] <Gilchrisht44> I want to utilize this script for providing a JS for widget which can be embedded on any external site
[04:13:35] <Cork> Gilchrisht44: i would go with writing it so it works with a reasonably old version of jquery instead
[04:13:53] <fabioportieri> is google down?
[04:13:59] <Cork> it's quite horrible to force multiple versions of jquery to load when it's not needed
[04:14:03] <eager> seutje: indeed I meant ctrl+shift+T, was a mistake
[04:14:04] <seutje> ?down google.com
[04:14:04] <b-ot> seutje: It's just you. http://google.com is up! (301 Moved Permanently)
[04:14:26] <fabioportieri> wow
[04:14:44] <eager> how could google be down :D
[04:14:50] <fabioportieri> you have a command for everything
[04:15:03] <Cork> eager: on what os do you see ctrl+shift+t remapped?
[04:15:03] <seutje> ?notreally
[04:15:18] <eager> Cork: Xubuntu
[04:15:30] <Cork> as far as i know it's still ctrl+shift+t
[04:15:33] <Gilchrisht44> @Cork: well, for standardized security and quality concerns, I have no other option to code a widget that got absolutely no conflicts with not just JQuery but with anyother library...
[04:15:41] <Cork> eager: distro builds?
[04:15:42] <eager> and FF20
[04:15:48] <eager> 12.4
[04:16:24] <Cork> Gilchrisht44: so, run the widget in an iframe
[04:16:35] <Cork> else you can't grantee anything
[04:16:41] <eager> and yes, i noticed, that it only "sometimes" reopens the tab. but more often brings up the "developer tool"
[04:16:45] <Gilchrisht44> Cork: not an option too!
[04:16:52] <Cork> Gilchrisht44: an iframe can have sandbox mode
[04:17:04] <Cork> Gilchrisht44: then what you're talking about isn't possible
[04:17:15] <Cork> you can't protect your code if you load it in the normal page
[04:17:43] <Cork> eager: sounds like a ubuntu thing then
[04:17:50] <eager> :(
[04:17:52] <eager> :)
[04:17:52] <Cork> eager: cause the mozilla builds don't
[04:18:11] <Gilchrisht44> Cork: I just don't want that my client call up at 3AM and say, we embedded your widget and it busted up whole site?
[04:18:16] <eager> thanks for the check... I might look into it
[04:18:24] <Cork> eager: ctrl+shift+k is the development tool shortcut
[04:18:39] <Cork> Gilchrisht44: so?
[04:18:53] <Cork> just write it so it works with jquery 1.2.6 - jquery 1.9
[04:18:57] <Cork> it IS doable
[04:19:20] <Cork> and it's a much better option then to slow down the page by loading multiple jquery versions
[04:19:35] <Cork> especially if the two jquery versions are the same version!!
[04:20:03] <Cork> honestly i would throw out something like that as fast as i could
[04:20:06] <Gilchrisht44> Cork: iframe is fine but would like to avoid it... I was thinking to build something in a way that my widget code remain in some namespace. Yes, JS namespace. My JQuery and all external files and JS used by my widget will be rendered in pre-defined namespace
[04:20:27] <Cork> Gilchrisht44: iframes is about to support inline code
[04:20:34] <Cork> and the namespace is what iframe gives you
[04:21:03] <Cork> Gilchrisht44: http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/iframe.html
[04:21:13] <Cork> check seamless and sandbox
[04:21:32] <Cork> that said, it doens't have the best of support yet
[04:21:48] <Cork> but it is the "right" way to solve it
[04:22:42] <Gilchrisht44> Cork: Search Engine Crawlers do not crawl iframe content? and that is the biggest set-back for me at the moment
[04:23:35] <Cork> Gilchrisht44: well forcing the page to dubble it's payload just for the sake of it...
[04:23:37] <Cork> it nasty
[04:24:15] <Gilchrisht44> no, JQuery Quarantine checks whether child page that is embedding the script already has JQuery?
[04:24:39] <Cork> but not if it is a compatible version
[04:24:40] <Gilchrisht44> if it has then it doesn't load Jquery again
[04:24:46] <Cork> just if it's the exact same one
[04:25:15] <Gilchrisht44> also, widget's code is compatible with JQuery 1.2 - 1.9
[04:25:17] <Cork> so if you load 1.9 and the site loads 1.9.1... opps
[04:25:26] <Gilchrisht44> nope
[04:25:33] <Cork> Gilchrisht44: then why do you even need to bother?
[04:25:33] <Gilchrisht44> it will not lead JQuery agai
[04:25:55] <Cork> just have a loader script that checks if jQuery is defined or not and show a "jQuery is missing"
[04:26:27] <Gilchrisht44> if some client has Prototype (Scriptaculous) or they have custom JS which calls up same functions $ etc or they have overridden $ or JQuery, then my widget would be busted
[04:26:40] <Cork> if(typeof(jQuery) === 'undefined') { alert('You need jQuery for <your widget> to work'); }
[04:26:55] <Cork> Gilchrisht44: and that's why you check jQuery and not $
[04:27:45] <Cork> tell the web developer what needs to happen instead of going behind there back
[04:27:56] <Gilchrisht44> Cork: Can somehow I gold plate all my JS code in some namespace as mentioned in JQuery Quarantine thing?
[04:28:02] <Cork> you can even include an example of how it would load jquery in compatible mode
[04:28:31] <Cork> you don't need an external lib for it
[04:29:02] <Cork> the part where it gets a bit sticky is how to pause your code and load the needed lib if it's not there
[04:29:09] <Cork> the rest is easy to do with native js
[04:29:43] <Cork> but if you want to dynamically load the lib if it's missing your code need to be in a callback that delays it's execution until the script is loaded
[04:30:16] <Cork> though that said, that isn't hard either
[04:30:18] <Gilchrisht44> Cork: that's fine, I already established a working prototype that loads all pre-reqs before rendering the iwdget
[04:30:29] <seutje> or go old-skool with a derpy timer :D
[04:31:09] <Gilchrisht44> Cork: I just want to isolate all my JS/CSS/HTML so that it doesn't quarrel with any other DOM element or JS Code
[04:31:11] <Cork> var load = document.createElement('script'); load.onload = function() { /* all your code goes here */ }; load.src = 'jquery url'; document.head.appendChild(load);
[04:31:31] <Cork> Gilchrisht44: you can't really isolate, as you ARE loading into the main page
[04:32:03] <Cork> you can movie it out of the way so it gets less likely to be hit
[04:32:12] <Cork> but you can't grantee anything
[04:32:15] <Gilchrisht44> if my $ is under my defined namespace then it will not collide with any other $ or jQuery ??
[04:32:39] <Gilchrisht44> Cork: Yes, that's what I am trying to achieve
[04:32:40] <Cork> (function($) {})(jQuery.noConflict(true));
[04:33:08] <Gilchrisht44> Cork: Can you refer me some good link where JQuery handles namespaces?
[04:33:21] <Cork> Gilchrisht44: jquery doesn't really handle namespaces
[04:33:36] <Cork> namespaces == scopes and that just a function your code runs in
[04:33:54] <Cork> every time you create a function you create a namespace
[04:34:49] <anli> Is img.load bad practice?
[04:35:03] <seutje> ?imageloaded
[04:35:05] <Cork> to bind an event hanler? no
[04:35:11] <seutje> `g imagesloaded
[04:35:12] <b-ot> seutje: desandro/imagesloaded · GitHub → https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[04:35:26] <Gilchrisht44> Cork: okay! let me figure how I can manipulate it so it remains least likely to quarrel with other JS
[04:35:30] <anli> Seems to be a list of caveats using img.load
[04:35:59] <Cork> anli: mostly only for img tags that is in the html, and not generated
[04:35:59] <seutje> anli: yeah, that's why imagesloaded was created, to make sure 404 images and cached images still fire it properly
[04:36:17] <anli> Aha, must check that then
[04:36:19] <anli> It uses a timer?
[04:36:39] <anli> Would like to have a fail handler as well
[04:37:19] <seutje> anli: $('#my-container, .article img').imagesLoaded( function( $images, $proper, $broken ) {
[04:37:28] <anli> Cool
[04:37:39] <seutje> it passes all images, and the ones that loaded and failed separately
[04:37:40] <anli> Yeah, I can see it uses a timer
[04:38:09] <anli> Hm, setTimeout without a time arg
[04:38:43] <anli> Is there a default setTimeout delay?
[04:38:57] <seutje> 0, xcept on IE, I guess
[04:39:02] <Cork> anli: setTimeout(func, 0);
[04:39:16] <Cork> and that ~ setTimeout(func, 9)
[04:39:27] <anli> In the code for imagesloaded, its more like setTimeout( doneLoading );
[04:39:27] <seutje> he means imagesLoaded uses a settimeout with single argument
[04:39:32] <Cork> except if the page is in the background then its ~setTimeout(func, 200)
[04:39:32] <anli> ok
[04:39:41] <Cork> seutje: yes i know
[04:39:58] <seutje> weird though, spec implies second argument is mandatory
[04:40:00] <Cork> this values are the default caps in browsers
[04:40:46] <seutje> nvm wrong spec, it is optional
[04:40:52] <Cork> `eval print(null * 1000)
[04:41:01] <Cork> `js print(null * 1000)
[04:41:08] <Cork> stupid bot
[04:41:38] <Marghitos> i am getting crazy with hover function. it works with tags, not with classes. I am using firefox. What can i do?
[04:41:39] <seutje> js> print(null * 1000);
[04:41:41] <Cork> anyway setTimeout is really old and has a list of special rules
[04:41:42] <b-ot> seutje: 0
[04:41:50] <Cork> so it's changed again...
[04:42:00] <seutje> nah, this is just the ideone interface
[04:42:15] <seutje> php> <?php echo 'it can do a lot!'; ?>
[04:42:16] <Cork> Marghitos: the selector doesn't matter
[04:42:18] <b-ot> seutje: it can do a lot!
[04:42:25] <Cork> O_o
[04:42:34] <Marghitos> i think so, but i am not able to make it working
[04:42:39] <timini> Is it possible to use .on with load event?
[04:42:44] <Cork> php> <?php echo 1+1; ?>
[04:42:46] <b-ot> Cork: 2
[04:42:49] <Cork> damn...
[04:42:51] <seutje> ?eval 'is the other I think';
[04:42:58] <seutje> guess not
[04:43:04] <anli> Why do people prefer .on?
[04:43:09] <Cork> Marghitos: then it means your selector isn't matching
[04:43:16] <seutje> INORITE? whodathunk PHP could count to 2
[04:43:17] <JohnBo> Cork, hey again. http://jsfiddle.net/ztVHz/5/ I ran into some trouble. The pictures who doesnt have retina-backups still have the attribute hi-res just that its empty. Is there a way to construct an if-statement that says only when data-hires!=null?
[04:43:28] <Cork> anli: cause it support all events comparent to the ones with shortcuts
[04:43:29] <seutje> anli: it's more flexible than bind or live
[04:43:45] <Cork> seutje: not really more flexible then bind
[04:43:53] <Cork> bind+delegate == on
[04:44:13] <Cork> and i'm a bit mixed about the combined syntax in on
[04:44:14] <Marghitos> what's wrong? http://jsbin.com/ijezoq/1/edit
[04:44:17] <Cork> make it harder to read
[04:44:20] <seutje> well, easier than bind
[04:44:35] <seutje> tbh, .submit was hard to read
[04:45:05] <seutje> or load, confuses the poo out of me
[04:45:18] <seutje> is it triggering? is it binding? is it doing ajax magic?
[04:45:24] <Cork> Marghitos: no jquery loaded
[04:45:35] <Cork> Marghitos: http://jsbin.com/ijezoq/2/edit
[04:45:52] <Marghitos> i have it in my local project..
[04:46:07] <Neozonz> how does someone display text that a user is writing in an input box imediately as output
[04:46:18] <Marghitos> and it's loaded, because another effect it's working.
[04:46:38] <Phil-Work> Neozonz, onKeySomething
[04:46:50] <Phil-Work> where Something is one of Up, Down or Press
[04:47:06] <Cork> seutje: $('sdkfhksjdfhkj sdhf kshd fkjh skd fjk hsd fk ').on('click mouseenter mouseleve change keypress', 'target', function() { /* sdfkhsdkjfh skdhf ksdh fkjs djkf  */})
[04:47:07] <Marghitos> finally, i found. I was missing a />
[04:47:15] <Cork> it quite easy to miss the delegation part there
[04:47:36] <Cork> (add a few 10'ths of lins of code in the callback)
[04:47:37] <seutje> truth, a multi line mess it a lot more clear :P
[04:47:45] <quietschie> hi, is there a dynatree channel?
[04:48:03] <Cork> seutje: compare that to $().delegate() and you see why i have a slight problem with on
[04:48:16] <Cork> not a big one, but it has a problem
[04:48:22] <seutje> oh yeah sure
[04:48:34] <seutje> I was comparing it to .bind and doing the delegation stuff urself
[04:48:52] <seutje> so used to doing that though :$
[04:48:52] <Cork> seutje: delegate isn't not somethign new in 1.7+
[04:48:56] <seutje> I know
[04:48:58] <Cork> it was just very unused by ppl before
[04:49:15] <Cork> and that's a big pity, cause it is a nice little function :)
[04:49:18] <seutje> but it wasn't around in 1.2.6 either :P
[04:49:23] <Cork> ya
[04:49:31] <Cork> nether was a lot of other things
[04:49:34] <seutje> I do a lotta drupal, so yeah...
[04:49:36] <Cork> like $(this).index()
[04:49:58] <seutje> I tried monkey-patching on in 1.2.6
[04:50:08] <Cork> seutje: drupal 5 used jquery 1.0.0 ...
[04:50:14] <Cork> that was... fun
[04:50:20] <seutje> I gave up and just patched all the other scripts to be compatible with 1.6+
[04:50:38] <seutje> that was a lot easier then piping the new event system into old jQuery
[04:50:45] <Cork> there is a nice plugin that makes it work with the latest jquery version
[04:50:53] <seutje> WAT?!
[04:50:54] <Cork> at lest it was a while back, i don't do drupal much anymore
[04:50:59] <seutje> oooh
[04:51:17] <seutje> u mean  a module that replaces ur jQuery with a newer one
[04:51:22] <Cork> ?g drupal jquery update
[04:51:22] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery Update | drupal.org → http://drupal.org/project/jquery_update
[04:51:31] <seutje> drupal 8 will have a jQuery downgrade module
[04:51:43] <seutje> core will update during the lifecycle
[04:51:51] <seutje> let's see where that goes, hm :P
[04:52:13] <Cork> well that was needed, the staleness of the old solution sucked too much
[04:52:38] <seutje> problem is u can't update to latest, cause it'll break a ton of contrib modules
[04:52:59] <Cork> seutje: anyway the update plugin actually loads shims for the core to work with a newer version of jquery
[04:53:11] <Cork> last i tested (drupal 6) it worked really well
[04:53:23] <Cork> used it a lot in drupal 5
[04:53:30] <quietschie> can someone help me please with a dynatree problem? I have a dynatree node and i want the surrounding div. I tried many things like jQuery(node).parent("div") or jQuery(node).parent("[class^=tree]"), but without success. I also have tried these things with jQuery(event.target)...nothing. All i have is node and event, as i am in the event Callback. Where am i failing?

[04:54:22] <Cork> jQuery(node).closest('.tree')
[04:54:45] <quietschie> Cork: I'll try that, thanks!
[04:54:49] <timini> Is it possible to use .on with load event?
[04:55:09] <Cork> yes
[04:55:10] <seutje> Cork: u mean jquery update? it just replaces the entire library http://drupalcode.org/project/jquery_update.git/blob/refs/heads/7.x-2.x:/jquery_update.module#l207
[04:55:27] <Croves> Hello guys! How do I expande/colapse a div, setting a min-width for it? I have a div and I want it to have 40px height, but if the inner text is bigger than this, then the div will keep the 40px, and when I click it, it will colapse.
[04:55:34] <Cork> seutje: sure, but some internal drupal things break
[04:55:41] <Croves> I'm using slideToggle
[04:55:44] <Cork> seutje: and that plugin fixes that
[04:55:49] <Croves> But I'm not gettin the effect that I need
[04:55:59] <Cork> seutje: and it basically replaces the lib yes
[04:56:05] <Cork> (and a little more)
[04:56:21] <seutje> oh yeah, looks like it swaps out states API as well, and jQuery UI and jquery forms
[04:56:30] <quietschie> Cork: wow, this works, but shouldn't do parent('.tree') do the same?
[04:56:55] <Cork> quicksilver: parent checks if the direct parent has the class tree, if not returns nothing
[04:57:06] <Cork> closest searchs up the tree for a parent with the class
[04:57:33] * quicksilver is not quietschie, FWIW.
[04:57:39] <Cork> opps
[04:57:49] <Cork> man the nicks are too similar in here >_<
[04:58:13] <Cork> didn't even see that they differed...
[04:58:57] <fabioportieri> Neozonz: look at keypress/keyup event
[04:58:59] <quietschie> Cork: thanks, why can't the api be that clear?
[04:59:06] <Neozonz> thanks guys
[04:59:10] <Neozonz> got it :)
[04:59:11] <Cork> `api parent
[04:59:11] <b-ot> Cork: .parent(): Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parent/

[04:59:32] <Cork> Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree
[04:59:39] <Cork> i think it's perfectly clear
[04:59:45] <seutje> maybe we should just map closest to firstParent()
[05:00:01] <Cork> true
[05:00:09] <seutje> actually, that would still be confusing
[05:00:12] <seutje> first from where?
[05:00:16] <Cork> :)
[05:00:20] <Cork> closestParent?
[05:00:34] <seutje> getClosestParentWhilstGoingUpInTheDOMTree()
[05:00:36] <Cork> or just make parent do the loop... (na)
[05:00:39] <Cork> LOL
[05:00:41] <seutje> there we go
[05:01:09] <seutje> added a "get" just to make it clear ;P
[05:01:09] <quietschie> would parents('.tree') have made the difference?
[05:01:26] <seutje> parents is like parent but grabs all
[05:01:26] <Cork> quicksilver: parents give you all parents that matches
[05:01:34] <Cork> not just the closest one
[05:01:50] <Cork> i see a lot of ppl use parents when they want closest
[05:01:58] <Cork> and it is a bit risky
[05:02:00] <seutje> and then filter on it or something
[05:02:08] <Cork> no, many don't filter at all
[05:02:14] <seutje> assuming "first" is what they think it means :P
[05:02:20] <Cork> $(this).parents(ul).addClass()
[05:02:22] <seutje> .parents().first() :D
[05:02:35] * Cork wrapps the code in an extra <ul><li> *opps*
[05:03:52] <DavidCh> hello, could sb help me with jqueryui tabs and crossfade effect?
[05:04:33] <DavidCh> is it possible to add this effect?
[05:06:08] <seutje> DavidCh: shouldn't be too hard with CSS transitions
[05:07:14] <seutje> u'll prolly have to override some of the default UI styles though
[05:07:30] <DavidCh> I tried to do this but it doesn't work on current version of jquery
[05:08:27] <Abbas|> guys, how do i get the href of pointed anchor-link? http://screencast.com/t/IbZsbAsu7QTQ
[05:08:59] <Abbas|> this seems to return 'undefined' > subforum_href = jQuery('.fforum .bbp-breadcrumb p a:last-child').attr('href');
[05:09:29] <Cork> Abbas|: don't give images of your code...
[05:10:09] <Cork> and you want jQuery('.fforum .bbp-breadcrumb p a').last().attr('href')
[05:10:17] <Abbas|> ah, ok thank you
[05:10:19] <Cork> :last-child only matches if it is; the last child
[05:10:34] <Abbas|> the a IS the last child though
[05:10:38] <Cork> no
[05:10:39] <Abbas|> the last a, child i.e.
[05:10:52] <Cork> but the a span isn't the last child of the p
[05:11:00] <Abbas|> hmmm
[05:11:01] <Cork> uh, the span is the last child
[05:11:21] <Cork> a:last-child means is an a element; and is the last child of the parent
[05:11:21] <Abbas|> but if i mention a:last-child, doesnt it mean , the last 'a' inside the container?
[05:11:28] <Abbas|> hmmm :/
[05:11:30] <Cork> no
[05:12:31] <seutje> I often trip up on that as well
[05:12:31] <Abbas|> ok your solution works, thank you
[05:12:51] <Abbas|> yea i still dont understand that ;/ the few time si've used last-child, it worked as how thought it works
[05:13:14] <Cork> Abbas|: :last-child is against the parent
[05:13:37] <Cork> think of it as parent.childNodes[last].nodeType = 'A'
[05:13:57] <Cork> not a for loop looking for the last nodeType A of the children
[05:14:13] <seutje> <div><div><a class="foo"></a></div><a class="bar"></a></div> $('a:last-child') will match both, $('a').last() will only match .bar
[05:14:55] <Cork> Abbas|: :last-child was implemented that way cause it's the only possible way to have a selector that isn't really slow
[05:15:57] <Cork> seutje: and $('a:last-child') won't match any in <div><div><a class="foo"></a><span></span></div><a class="bar"></a><span></span></div>

[05:23:30] <jarr0dsz> i now try to debug this existing plugin, but just get a vague error in firebug, anyone some good advise on how to debug it or check if the code is still valid on latest jquery?
[05:24:00] <jarr0dsz> getting a "Error: Error calling method on NPObject!" seems there is just something broke in the plugin since im not loading it just include

[05:38:24] <norjor> Hi, I'm using a system which will add a class to <body> under a special circumstance, in this case I need to target <html> which is unchanged. So how can I target <html> using <body> as starting point ?
[05:39:55] <snorti> norjor: can you take a look to my too?
[05:40:26] <Cork> norjor: $('body.the-class').closest('html').add('body')
[05:40:37] <Cork> norjor: css selectors can't do backwards selection
[05:41:10] <norjor> I see, was thinking maybe .parent could do it, but have had no success
[05:42:08] <Cork> parent can do it ya
[05:42:18] <Cork> as html is always the parent of body
[05:42:31] <Cork> i just have a habbit of always using closest
[05:42:45] <Cork> norjor: $('body.the-class').parent().add('body')
[05:44:54] <norjor> thanks Cork, it's working now!
[05:45:05] <snorti> :-\
[05:45:36] <norjor> sorry snorti really need to finish something, maybe someone else can help :-)
[05:46:16] <snorti> i get rid of it.. min-heigt made problems
[05:46:27] <Cork> snorti: i did ask you a question before but you never answered
[05:46:45] <snorti> Cork: rly? oh
[05:47:27] <snorti> Cork: maybe i aint read it because you aint set my nick as prefix
[05:48:06] <Cork> snorti: wrong nick ya
[05:48:20] <Cork> snorti: are you hiding the the element though the css file?
[05:49:48] <snorti> Cork yes i do
[05:49:59] <Cork> snorti: use .hide() instead
[05:50:12] <Cork> and hide it when the page loads
[05:50:33] <snorti> for?
[05:50:52] <snorti> after i delete the min-height it works
[05:50:53] <Cork> have the css set the display it should have when its visible
[05:51:05] <snorti> hm k
[05:51:06] <Cork> ah
[05:51:16] <Cork> ya, min-height will break sliding
[05:51:24] <Cork> anyway the .hide() is still true though
[05:52:12] <Cork> snorti: set the min height as a class, and toggle/add/remove it after the animation
[05:53:39] <snorti> Cork : ok thx

[05:54:54] <lucaszz> SerializeArray works with dom object i think
[05:54:56] <snorti> Cork: is there a way to wait for the animation end and accept then a new slideDown
[05:54:59] <neo1> Correct
[05:55:02] <lucaszz> I want to serialize simple array

[05:56:28] <Cork> snorti: .animtes({}, time, function() { $(this).addClass() })
[05:56:49] <Cork> stupid_perl_monk: what is the error?
[05:58:11] <stupid_perl_monk> Cork it just doesn't work. I am trying to click a button and it works in the fiddle but when I click the button on the site it does not work. The button is being transformed into a cufon. I don't know if that affects it.
[05:58:19] <stupid_perl_monk> http://jsfiddle.net/jPneT/1524/
[05:58:23] <stupid_perl_monk> That's the fiddle that works
[05:58:39] <Cork> stupid_perl_monk: so, no console errors?
[05:59:05] <stupid_perl_monk> I'm not sure where I would see a console error, this is my first time writing jquery instead of copy pasting.
[05:59:07] <stupid_perl_monk> Forgive me.
[05:59:10] <Cork> 2. have you checked that the code is actually run (console.log('i am here'))
[05:59:18] <jammanbo> I've got an issue. If I send multiple Ajax requests to a resource, it chokes. I've got to send them one at a time. Problem is, the requests originate quite independently of each other, so I don't know how to queue them up and process them one by one. Anyone got any ideas? I'm hoping deferreds might have a magic bullet to halp me.
[05:59:29] <Cork> stupid_perl_monk: in the browser console
[05:59:49] <Cork> ctrl+shift+j or ctrl+shift+k depending on the browser
[06:00:36] <neo1> One more thing I noticed the hover event does not behave like click.  I'll like to apply css on element on hover
[06:01:05] <Cork> neo1: what do you mean?
[06:02:08] <neo1> Cork when I hover over an anchor I'm trying to apply css to a child element
[06:02:23] <Cork> neo1: and why are you doing this in js?
[06:03:21] <neo1> Cork because the element is a different element to the one I am hovering over
[06:03:32] <Cork> ah
[06:03:57] <lucaszz> Cork: I found http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[06:04:00] <Cork> and there he's gone
[06:04:11] <ffoo1> I'm back
[06:04:20] <ffoo1> Got disconnected
[06:04:31] <Cork> lucaszz: that one generates paramstrings though, not a serialization of the array
[06:04:44] <snorti> Cork: how would this looks for me?
[06:04:55] <Cork> snorti: how would what look?
[06:04:59] <ffoo1> <- neo1
[06:05:02] <jop008> $.getJSON( "./index.php?-action=showremarksectie&sectionID=26&inspectionformID=10", function (result) {               alert ("loaded");
[06:05:09] <jop008> my alert is never fired
[06:05:23] <Cork> snorti: you mean the callback?
[06:05:38] <Cork> snorti: read the doc for the animation function your using
[06:05:49] <Cork> and use what i gave you as an example
[06:05:56] <snorti> .animates({}, time, function() { $(this).addClass() })
[06:06:02] <snorti> hm ok,
[06:06:12] <ffoo1> Forget the css how do I display an alert on hover?  Same as click event?
[06:06:13] <snorti> i cant follow you atm but i will try
[06:06:42] <Cork> snorti: i meant if you want the min-height set it when the animation is done, and the element is visible
[06:06:45] <lucaszz> Cork: How to serialize whole array?
[06:06:55] <lucaszz> I want to get query string
[06:06:58] <lucaszz> as result
[06:07:06] <Cork> snorti: if the element has a min-height of 300px how would it animate from 0 > 300 ?
[06:07:17] <Cork> lucaszz: ha
[06:07:27] <Cork> lucaszz: then you need to wrap your array in an object
[06:07:35] <Cork> { arr: array }
[06:07:54] <Cork> lucaszz: cause you can't make a valid param string from just an array
[06:08:07] <Cork> (unless it's an array of arrays)
[06:23:07] <herr_john> hello, could someone tell me, why a click action on an element, which is inserted with .prepend() doesn't work? The click event should call another function.
[06:23:52] <Cork> herr_john: most likely cause you're binding the event handler before the element exists
[06:28:11] <herr_john> Cork, thanks. I'll check that.
[06:28:32] <Cork> herr_john: if you are, use delegated event listeners to get around the problem
[06:37:57] <jammanbo> herr_john: Was the event bound after the element was added to the DOM? Or was it bound using on()? Else, it won't work.
[06:44:54] <amaroks> Hello, How do i compare two float numbers? ie 1.2563 and 1.2564 ?
[06:46:50] <pamere> hi guys i have a span in a tr and above that tr i have another tr that has an id , i am trying to get the value of the id
[06:47:06] <pamere> when i click on the span
[06:47:08] <pamere> var addressid= ($(this).closest('tr').attr('id'));
[06:47:11] <pamere> but that doesnt work
[06:47:14] <pamere> any ideas?
[06:47:39] <xec> amaroks: the same way you would compare any other number?
[06:47:47] <xec> amaroks: what are you trying to check
[06:48:33] <xec> pamere: you have two nested tables?
[06:49:59] <pamere> xec http://pastebin.com/F1yf2Ptw
[06:50:26] <pamere> need to get the value of the tr id when the span is clicked
[06:50:33] <xec> pamere: pastebin.com is blocked for some reason
[06:50:53] <amaroks> xec i want to see if 1.2563 > 1.2564
[06:50:56] <xec> pamere: .closest() means the inner one (first match traversing up the tree) - so if you're inside *two* tables and want the outer one, you could do it twice .closest("tr").closest("tr")
[06:51:11] <xec> amaroks: ok, the code for that would be: 1.2563 > 1.2564
[06:51:18] <pamere> xec excellent
[06:51:20] <pamere> ill try that first
[06:51:21] <pamere> :)
[06:52:14] <pamere> $(this).closest('tr').closest("tr").attr('id')); didnt work
[06:52:23] <pamere> value is still undefinded
[06:52:30] <pamere> undefined
[06:52:36] <xec> pamere: what does the html look like?
[06:53:00] <xec> pamere: and are you sure that 'this' is the span you were talking about?
[06:53:39] <pamere> html
[06:53:39] <pamere> <tr id="51" class="item"></tr><tr class="buttons"><td class="submitaki"><span class="addaddress">Update</span>  </td></tr>
[06:53:44] <xec> ?p
[06:54:10] <xec> silly bot
[06:54:34] <xec> pamere: oh, so by "above" you don't mean nested, you mean the previous sibling?
[06:54:41] <xec> pamere: try .prev()
[06:54:58] <pamere> yes
[06:54:59] <pamere> :_)
[06:55:08] <pamere> sorry one above
[06:55:24] <xec> what?
[06:56:11] <pamere> i meant previous
[06:56:12] <pamere> yes
[06:57:19] <pamere> thanks that worked
[06:57:20] <pamere> :)
[06:57:28] <xec> :)
[06:57:41] <kladze> hello, im trying to subtract 2 numbers from eachother... but it's not working and i can't figure out what the problem is... http://pastebin.com/VUeE9nZe
[06:58:09] <Raydiation> is it possible to tell the draggable item to scroll in its parent?
[06:58:17] <xec> ?paste
[06:58:17] <b-ot> xec: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:58:17] <Raydiation> but 3 parents up
[06:58:22] <xec> kladze ^
[06:58:40] <Raydiation> its a looks like parent > ul > li > ul > li.draggable
[06:58:51] <Raydiation> theres only document, window and parent iirc
[06:59:59] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I have an event triggered by clicking on an element with 2 classes. Is there anyway to retrieve the class in the event trigger that was clicked? E.g. <button class="btn thing"> if there was a trigger that used 'thing', how would I refer to '.thing' within the event?
[07:00:54] <kladze> hello, im trying to subtract 2 numbers from eachother... but it's not working and i can't figure out what the problem is... http://fixee.org/paste/e2xmk20/
[07:01:32] <xec> Raydiation: you can give the containment option a selector, if that's what you mean
[07:01:57] <DeltaHeavy> kladze: I'm pretty sure isNaN returns true/false.
[07:02:22] <xec> DeltaHeavy++
[07:02:30] <eager> kladze: var getprice = $('div .footer span').val();
[07:02:46] <eager> instead of .val() try .text()
[07:02:47] <xec> .val() on a span is pretty funky too lol
[07:02:50] <xec> :D
[07:03:03] <kladze> eager okay
[07:03:04] <eager> and then parseInt()
[07:03:25] <eager> .parseInt(span.text())
[07:04:00] <anli> How do I inspect an element in IE?
[07:04:11] <xec> without the period :)
[07:04:17] <DeltaHeavy> anli: F12
[07:04:26] <anli> F12 will only show me the DOM with all elements
[07:04:38] <xec> anli: there is a button with a cursor on it, top left
[07:04:47] <DeltaHeavy> anli: There should be a mouse cursor somewhere there. Click on that then click on the element you want to inspect.
[07:04:58] <anli> Ah, like I pick it?
[07:05:01] <xec> ye
[07:05:28] <anli> cool, I like it
[07:05:35] <eager> lol
[07:05:43] <anli> Despite its IE
[07:05:45] <anli> :)
[07:06:58] <kladze> eager: that worked :-) however if i have a number..  113,23 and then subtract with 100 the outcome is then 13 and not 13,23 how can i get my 2 decimals also?
[07:07:09] <anli> I cannot delete an element, it seeems
[07:07:22] <anli> Thats something I really like with fb
[07:07:28] <anli> (firebug)
[07:07:28] <xec> kladze: i just gotta say, the selector on line 1 is pretty funky too. IDs are unique on a page, so the whole input:radio[id="tvpack_type_1"]... thing is pretty useless, just do "#tvpack_type_1"
[07:08:05] <anli> navigating to parent element with backspace is nice
[07:08:34] <kladze> xec: yea.. i know... but it wasnt working before.. so i had to to that
[07:08:39] <kladze> but seems to work now
[07:08:58] <eager> kladze: i would look into jquery function .toFixed()
[07:09:02] <xec> kladze: and inside the handler, you can access it with the `this` keyword, no need to select it again - just do this.checked
[07:09:15] <kladze> xec: yea
[07:09:16] <anli> Hm, maybe I should upgrade IE, it does not automatically, right?
[07:09:35] <Raydiation> any idea why the draggable does not scroll? http://jsfiddle.net/SStFF/
[07:09:38] <kladze> eager: i will, thanks
[07:09:45] <sahbeewah> DeltaHeavy, elaborate on your question? do you want to access that element, or figure out which class was there to trigger the event handler?
[07:10:27] <Z3R0> yo yo yo
[07:10:29] <xec> .toFixed() is native https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed
[07:11:33] <tocka> Hi, what should I do that these 2 "actions" would be executed at the same time? http://pastebin.com/wtYvPuy3
[07:11:45] <DeltaHeavy> sahbeewah: I want to figure out which class was there to trigger the event handler.
[07:11:50] <xec> ?paste @ tocka
[07:11:50] <b-ot> tocka: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:11:50] <tocka> so that it would change the angle and would me merged to left at the same time
[07:16:37] <sahbeewah> DeltaHeavy, hmm... i think the only "correct" way to do that without making any assumptions, is to pass the selector string into the event data parameter of the event handling method
[07:17:02] <DeltaHeavy> sahbeewah: Yeah, I can't see a graceful way to do this. I'm going to restructure some things to make this cleaner.
[07:19:30] <sahbeewah> that's probably a good idea. if the logic inside the handler is dependent on the element that triggered the event, then you should probably have two separate handlers
[07:19:48] <kladze> eager: i need to ask for your help again..... where should i place the .toFixed(2) ?? i've tried on the parseint and where i write my value back in
[07:20:08] <kladze> but still get the old result
[07:20:45] <eager> kladze: actually, I only used that to _limit_ the number of decimals, not to force it... so, tbh it was just a guess
[07:21:00] <tocka> How could I use these two "http://jsfiddle.net/8LV3p/" actions at once?
[07:21:02] <kladze> okay :)
[07:21:30] <tocka> I am trying to make that sign swing a little bit..
[07:22:48] <eager> kladze: it should be maybe an argument of .parseInt or .parseFloat?
[07:23:02] <eager> look up their documentation
[07:24:02] <Raydiation> got it
[07:24:08] <Raydiation> helper: 'clone' prevented scrolling
[07:26:22] <tocka> any help?
[07:29:07] <boulderdave> I'm trying to manipulate table rows & cells… it seems the only methods available to me are the ones defined in the HTML spec - makes sense… however, why do all the stackoverflow post for example use methods like .html(), .replaceWith(), etc. - these methods are not available for me when I try to use them…  is it that I'm using HTML5?
[07:30:04] <boulderdave> and if so - how in the hek do i simply insert cells and set their content if I'm not able to use any of these methods?  I haven't had any luck so far with the methods available in the spec.
[07:30:37] <NoiseEee> boulderdave: those are jquery methods
[07:30:57] <v0lksman> is there a better way to say this:  $(this).parent().parent().parent().next();
[07:30:57] <NoiseEee> boulderdave: so either you haven't loaded jquery, or you're not working with what you think you're working with
[07:31:48] <BillCriswell> v0lksman: You can do .closest('.someParentClass').next()
[07:31:52] <seutje> v0lksman: only if you have a way to identify that parent before the next call
[07:32:07] <v0lksman> BillCriswell: that may work...will try...thanks!
[07:33:33] <tibo_> hi, i have a question... How do I change the arrow of select?
[07:33:44] <v0lksman> BillCriswell: beauty!
[07:33:54] <amaroks> Hello, anyone know what is this weird error? TypeError: Cannot read property 'submitted' of undefined
[07:34:08] <amaroks> getting it when using $("#myform").submit()
[07:34:11] <BillCriswell> tibo_: With horrible browser specific CSS pseudo selectors usually.
[07:34:34] <boulderdave> NoiseEee:  if I call the simple selector: $("#graph_container").children('tr')[0].children('td') I get the error: TypeError: Property 'children' of object #<HTMLTableRowElement> is not a function
[07:34:43] <BillCriswell> amaroks: Is #myform actually a form?
[07:34:54] <amaroks> BillCriswell: yes, 100%
[07:35:15] <BillCriswell> boulderdave: [0] returns the raw dom element.
[07:35:29] <BillCriswell> You want .eq(0) where [0] is I think.
[07:35:39] <BillCriswell> amaroks: Some code to look at would be nice.
[07:35:51] <boulderdave> BillCriswell:  ah son of a...
[07:35:56] <NoiseEee> boulderdave: what BillCriswell says. you're call to [0] is a call to the bare dom element
[07:36:01] <NoiseEee> s/you're/your
[07:37:09] <boulderdave> NoiseEee:  Yea i understand, thank you for your help everyone.  BillCriswell
[07:37:22] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[07:40:54] <amph1bius> hey BillCriswell!
[07:41:32] <BillCriswell> Ayyy!
[07:41:50] <seutje> generating a bunch of elements, but I need to keep a reference around to each of them. would it be better to create the reference when appending, or would it be better to append the whole set in 1 go and do the lookup when I need it?
[07:43:07] <herr_john> jammanbo thanks, i'll test that.
[07:43:35] <seutje> nvm, I gotta restructure this to make instances out of my things
[07:46:49] <kladze> eager: that seems to work a little.... if i use .toFixed(2), i get my 2 decimals.. but they are not precise... do you know how to overcome that problem?
[07:47:02] <kladze> to they are 100% precise
[07:47:31] <eager> what do you mean not precise? are they rounded?
[07:48:47] <eager> kladze: how about using .parseFloat() ? here it seems to be better: http://www.minihowtos.net/jquery-parseint
[07:50:52] <kladze_> eager: dno  what happend... irc crashed... dont know if you got my message... but it "works" with parseInt and toFixed(2) to get 2 decimals, but the decimals are not precise... do you know a command or how i can overcome this problem so that the decimals are 100% precise?
[07:51:14] <kladze_> sry parsefloat*
[07:51:47] <eager> kladze: how does your code look like now?
[07:51:51] <NoiseEee> kladze: if you're doing this on a computer, you won't get decimals 100% precise.
[07:52:31] <NoiseEee> http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/why-computers-suck-at-maths-644771?artc_pg=1

[07:52:53] <kladze> eager: it looks like this http://fixee.org/paste/k6uskpc/
[07:53:13] <kladze> NoiseEee: so you are saying i can't get my 2 decimals correct?
[07:53:26] <NoiseEee> kladze: if you're using parseInt, supply a dadix
[07:53:28] <NoiseEee> radix
[07:53:32] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt
[07:54:23] <Z3R0> anyone ever used google's add to calendar links ?
[07:54:36] <eager> NoiseEee: he's using parseFloat, does he still need the radix then?
[07:54:46] <NoiseEee> he's using parseFloat and parseInt
[07:55:11] <eager> right, sorry, didn't notice
[07:55:34] <eager> that parseint there isn't needless?
[07:55:42] <NoiseEee> it is yes lol
[07:56:08] <NoiseEee> kladze: maybe you should take a closer look at what you think 'getprice' is?
[07:56:43] <eager> btw. i would simply remove .toFixed() now, as you are using parseFloat(), so theoretically it should do as it is, without the tofixed ?
[07:58:54] <kladze> i always get something like this... 34.6999
[07:59:05] <kladze> when it needs to be 34.70
[07:59:13] <NoiseEee> kladze: yes, well welcome to math.
[07:59:15] <NoiseEee> and computers.
[07:59:50] <NoiseEee> perhaps you're after https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/round
[08:00:02] <rntf> kladze try to use parseInt(number, 10); or round the number using Math.round
[08:00:11] <BillCriswell> 34.6999.toFixed(2)
[08:00:17] <BillCriswell> >> 34.6999.toFixed(2)
[08:00:30] <BillCriswell> I'll stop pretending I understand the bot.
[08:01:47] <skinofstars> what do you use for a bot in here?
[08:01:52] <kladze> nothing is working .. :s

[08:03:31] <BillCriswell> Putting a table in an <li> is interesting.
[08:04:17] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: $('li table tr:eq(0) td:eq(0)') would work
[08:05:12] <BillCriswell> Oh, second.
[08:05:20] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: $('li table tr:eq(0) td:eq(1)')
[08:07:16] <NoiseEee> kladze: var result = (parseFloat(getPrice) - 100).toFixed(2)

[08:26:01] <monk12> just curious, if you have a JS file thats served via cache-busting mechanism aka <script src="blah.js?t=<%=timestamp%>"/>... is there a way to debug in Firebug or Chrome? currently it can't cause it thinks its a entire new file (which to the browser it is i guess)
[08:26:50] <monk12> would be cool if there was an option in Firebug to treat the JS files as the same when downloaded if its the same file location/path
[08:32:53] <djQuery>  /join #html5
[08:37:55] <djQuery> dang chrome for android http://jsbin.com/html5inputnumber/1/edit
[08:38:44] <djQuery> it appears that <input type="number" min="0" max="500" step=".01"> doesn't all decimals
[08:39:07] <Z3R0> does it need to ?
[08:39:14] <Z3R0> couldn't you do the conversion on the other end ?
[08:39:30] <djQuery> Z3R0, you can't type a . at all
[08:39:50] <Z3R0> in the html maybe...
[08:40:03] <Z3R0> but you can on your jquery or backend...
[08:40:09] <djQuery> Z3R0, <input type="number" > forces the keyboard that comes up on mobile devices to just be the number keyboard
[08:40:19] <Z3R0> ah
[08:40:34] <djQuery> but the decimal key is blank on the number pad for some reason
[08:41:22] <djQuery> was hoping some one could reproduce the issue on their end and see if this is a bug or what
[08:42:30] <djQuery> this doesnt do it either <input type="number" step="any" >
[08:44:11] <cwatson> I'm trying to create a jQuery image slider (slide to the next image). Anyone know how I can get this to work? - http://jsbin.com/olufet/1/edit
[08:47:08] <djQuery> slider\carosel  the most re-invinted wheel
[08:47:33] <eager> jquery cycle plugin is quite popular
[08:47:47] <eager> has a lightweight version too, afaik
[08:48:50] <cwatson> So the idea is to attach code and use methods not learning the engine behind it?
[08:53:01] <Krambiorix> i have this problem : http://pastebin.com/cbcddU5f
[08:54:56] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: You probably want var names = [];
[08:55:07] <djQuery> cwatson, http://jsbin.com/olufet/2/edit you mean something like this ? http://jsbin.com/olufet/2/edit
[08:55:26] <BillCriswell> var name; names.push('foo') = TypeError: Cannot call method 'push' of undefined
[08:55:51] <BillCriswell> var names = []; names.push('foo'); makes names = ['foo']
[08:56:10] <eager> if I want to set a global variable, window.myVariable, do I need var in front of it to declare?
[08:56:20] <NoiseEee> eager: no, those don't take "var"
[08:56:28] <eager> NoiseEee++
[08:56:31] <eager> thanks
[08:57:36] <cwatson> djQuery: Looking...
[08:58:22] <djQuery> cwatson, jsbin seems to be having some issues today
[08:58:46] <cwatson> djQuery: I see that. But I don't think the code works after the second slide.
[08:59:46] <djQuery> cwatson, does now
[08:59:47] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/olufet/2/edit
[09:01:31] <reloadz> hi! got problem with .index() - all the time i get back -1
[09:01:32] <cwatson> Well, it works on fiddle but not on Dropbox. - https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/77127384/contentSlider2/index.html
[09:01:41] <cwatson> Weird.
[09:01:43] <reloadz> but it sould return 3
[09:02:20] <reloadz> here is site I use .index() http://rtkompanija.lv/test/fotografs/lv/fotografi
[09:02:29] <reloadz> in console.log() I return the value
[09:02:52] <Krambiorix> thx BillCriswell  that helped!
[09:03:19] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: Welcome!
[09:03:34] <reloadz> can anyone help?
[09:03:50] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, what you said earlier about $('.ui-autocomplete li table tr:eq(0) td:eq(1)').each(function() .... . I want to get all li's and get the second cell of that... I don't think this does that
[09:04:09] <djQuery> cwatson, now it will endlessly rotate  http://jsbin.com/olufet/2/edit
[09:05:08] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: $('li').each(function(){ var secondCellText = console.log($(this).find('tr:eq(0) td:eq(1)').text());  }); should work.
[09:05:27] <cwatson> djQuery: Wonder why this does not work on my local machine and dropbox - https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/77127384/contentSlider2/index.html#
[09:06:19] <BillCriswell> cwatson: Does your url begin with file:/// or http:// ?
[09:06:25] <djQuery> cwatson, working for me here at that url
[09:06:30] <cwatson> djQuery, nm it works. cache problem
[09:06:37] <cwatson> Browser 101 user error
[09:06:40] <cwatson> Sorry guys
[09:06:47] <cwatson> Thank you djQuery++
[09:08:04] <djQuery> cwatson, now let me know when u get prev workin
[09:08:29] <cwatson> djQuery, lol kk
[09:12:33] <cwatson> djQuery: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/77127384/contentSlider2/index.html#
[09:12:38] <cwatson> Thank you for all your help man!
[09:12:51] <djQuery> cwatson, my version http://jsbin.com/olufet/2/edit
[09:13:00] <reloadz> solved my problem! thx!
[09:13:39] <cwatson> djQuery: Is your version better?
[09:14:15] <djQuery> cwatson, notice I only have 1 movement function
[09:15:14] <cwatson> Oh, gotcha.
[09:15:16] <cwatson> That's neat.
[09:15:31] <cwatson> Paramatized it.
[09:16:57] <djQuery> cwatson, look again http://jsbin.com/olufet/2/edit
[09:17:00] <cwatson> djQuery: wish I had your knowledge. I feel so weak with creating things like this with jQuery like parallax scrolling,etc.
[09:18:08] <eager> cwatson: obviously you are on the right track to it :)
[09:18:12] <djQuery> cwatson, I reduced it to 1 click handler as well
[09:18:42] <djQuery> cwatson, start here http://try.jquery.com
[09:18:47] <cwatson> eager: Eh, I am but it seems I obviously don't have the knowledge to finish it.
[09:18:50] <cwatson> Pisses me off.
[09:19:20] <cwatson> Yeah, I should try that. Maybe they have an advance section.
[09:19:29] <djQuery> cwatson, not yet
[09:19:30] <chiggins> Question. Any good jquery functionality to transform XML with XSLT in the browser?
[09:20:03] <PerlWebDev> boy, that's a generic request
[09:20:18] <cwatson> I appreciate all the help and kindness eager and jQuery. You guys rock.
[09:20:27] <cwatson> djQuery*
[09:20:30] <eager> :)
[09:21:23] <cwatson> djQuery: Prev button skips 3 I believe - http://jsbin.com/olufet/2#
[09:22:57] <djQuery> cwatson, appears that it does
[09:23:26] <cwatson> Not sure why. It works well for Next. Weird.
[09:25:01] <djQuery> cwatson, fixed http://jsbin.com/olufet/2/edit
[09:25:19] <basiclaser> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNALHa6fVxA
[09:26:31] <track7> any ajax developers here?
[09:26:34] <cwatson> djQuery: Sweet.
[09:26:59] <theresajayne_> I need to get a parent of the current "item" but not sure how to get that parent item....
[09:27:33] <djQuery> theresajayne_, see ?.parent()
[09:27:43] <djQuery> ?parent
[09:27:56] <djQuery> theresajayne_, there is also .closest
[09:28:43] <theresajayne_> i have tried but its not working http://jsfiddle.net/DQ4uG/
[09:29:20] <djQuery> theresajayne_, $('li a').on('click', function(){ var pUL = $(this).closest('ul'), pLI = $(this).parent(); });
[09:30:31] <djQuery> theresajayne_, think you want closest in that case
[09:30:48] <djQuery> theresajayne_, also learn chaning instead of selecting the item multiple times
[09:30:56] <theresajayne_> its not the closest div though
[09:31:06] <NoiseEee> theresajayne_: read the manual about closest().
[09:31:11] <NoiseEee> theresajayne_: its what you want.
[09:31:52] <djQuery> theresajayne_, $(commentedid).show().closest("div[name='candidatecolor']").css('background','#dedede');
[09:37:45] <Krambiorix> How can i get out of my function when $.inArray(this.value, names) === -1 ?? http://pastebin.com/F5gDDxkY
[09:38:16] <djQuery> Krambiorix, err return
[09:39:31] <Krambiorix> djQuery, that's what i do...
[09:41:53] <NoiseEee> great! solved.
[09:43:02] <Krambiorix> but it doesn't exit...
[09:43:26] <NoiseEee> Krambiorix: i guess provide a fiddle of it not working
[09:44:40] <clov3r> maybe try changing return this.value; to return;
[09:45:32] <tpyo> anyone know where I might start in trying to replicate the way facebook displays friends? i.e. an item list, searchable, non-paging and auto-load as the fold hits
[09:45:52] <tpyo> are there standard controls or frameworks out there that already offer this sort of functionality?
[09:46:27] <tpyo> im finding most grids are not suitable, as they're often stymied by the "paging" metaphor
[09:47:21] <Krambiorix> NoiseEee, there you are : http://jsfiddle.net/tXkMg/1/
[09:47:29] <tpyo> and the way I see it, I don't even need an AJAX, just output the html (worst case scenario floats around 1k-2k results) and use javascript to control what is seen (I'd guess)
[09:48:34] <DeltaHeavy> IMO 1k-2k results is crazy. I'd display a certain amount, then different one's loaded via AJAX.
[09:48:35] <tpyo> as the slowest aspect is loading the image by the browser and aside from those above the fold the rest of its deferred until more is loaded
[09:48:55] <DeltaHeavy> It's not like jQuery doesn't make AJAX ezmode :p
[09:49:00] <NoiseEee> Krambiorix: you're deliberately calling the function three times, your question isnt about how to exit a function.
[09:49:11] <tpyo> true but its not like 2k html elements is that absurd
[09:49:34] <tpyo> its the loading of the images that presents the slowdown
[09:49:53] <tpyo> i just don't see the need to create needless chatter if the worst case isn't that bad
[09:50:02] <clov3r> noiseeee i think krambiorix would like to exit the each loop the first time a value not in the array is found
[09:50:06] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/tXkMg/2/ Krambiorix
[09:50:23] <Krambiorix> indeed
[09:50:40] <clov3r> oh but you got it ;)
[09:51:06] <tpyo> but obviously if there is nothing out there that has already gone some way to solving the problem it might be epedient to use AJAX just cause its easier to filer server side
[09:51:08] <NoiseEee> Krambiorix: "return false" will break you out of the each() loop
[09:51:17] <Krambiorix> NoiseEee, ok, return false, but i want to return the culprit...
[09:51:26] <NoiseEee> Krambiorix: assign it to something, don't return it.
[09:51:34] <tpyo> but that's what I kind of mean, i'd be using AJAX cause its convenient to me, not because its actually necessary
[09:51:59] <tpyo> easier to filter* server side
[09:52:19] <dobie_gillis> what's that web app called that lists the latest software libraries all in one place, and it's configurable?
[09:52:56] <Krambiorix> NoiseEee, ow ok, thanks for the help!
[09:54:09] <cwatson> jQuery Image Slider: Can you not make it slide left to right like this? - http://jsbin.com/oyeqar/1/edit
[09:55:20] <tpyo> anyone have any idea what facebook uses to construct their control?
[09:55:35] <theresajayne_> i am having a strange cross browser issue, I have a link that calls a simple onclick to window.opwn(url) but its not working on firefox any ideas?
[09:56:52] <monk12> Im using jquery to duplicate a table header row, and it scrolls along when user scrolls down the page... I noticed with no widths defined on the row, it takes it out of context, so the table-cells dont line up the same way as the other regular table rows... anyway to fix this without resorting to hardcoding the widths of each cell?
[09:57:56] <monk12> pretty much using this example: http://css-tricks.com/examples/PersistantHeaders/ can see it goofing if you remove the width: 200px; on the th element in FireBug
[09:58:10] <clov3r> theresajayne_ : firefox is blocking popups?
[10:00:34] <theresajayne_> no popup warning, is there a way to get around it?
[10:00:54] <clov3r> well check your settings
[10:01:05] <clov3r> not really sure, if it's working in ie and chrome?
[10:01:48] <theresajayne_> no not blocking popups
[10:02:01] <theresajayne_> its working fine in chrome  / ie
[10:02:16] <clov3r> weird
[10:02:20] <clov3r> got a link?
[10:02:29] <theresajayne_> i have a stopImmediatePropogation followed by a window,open
[10:02:37] <theresajayne_> not really
[10:02:46] <BillCriswell> monk12: Hmmm... How about $('th').css('width', '+=0') ?
[10:02:54] <theresajayne_> function displayJob(link) {         event.stopImmediatePropagation();         window.open(link,"JobDetail");     }
[10:03:47] <theresajayne_> also another link is not working
[10:05:14] <clov3r> no errors i assume, just unresponsive?
[10:05:27] <monk12> hey BillCristwell, where would i run/test that... testing in the Console after I turn off the width:200px?
[10:05:29] <clov3r> try console logging before and after the statements?
[10:05:51] <BillCriswell> I was thinking on your code before you cloned it.
[10:06:12] <BillCriswell> That way you don't need to hardcode it really.
[10:06:27] * hlve slaps BillCriswell around a bit with a large trout
[10:06:29] <monk12> gotcha, let me try that out.
[10:06:49] <BillCriswell> hlve: Do you use mIRC or just type that out manually?
[10:06:59] <hlve> the world may never know.
[10:07:16] <BillCriswell> I'm thinking manually.
[10:07:49] <hlve> if it isn't manually, then i'm not spenidng enough time doing it ;}
[10:08:18] <BillCriswell> Agreed!
[10:10:49] <BillCriswell> monk12: The only issue with that approach is if it's responsive you'll need to run it on resize... I think your safest bet might be overflow scroll on tbody?
[10:10:55] <BillCriswell> I could be wrong, though.
[10:11:21] <BillCriswell> Haven't done any research as to which is handled better by the user.
[10:13:44] <theresajayne_> popups not blocked all window.open links not working in firefox, all ok in chrome/ie (for a change)
[10:14:29] <monk12> Im trying that approach you orig suggested now... it seems to add the width correctly to the original row... then the modified floatingHeader row, gets correct value for most of the data cells, but the first one is 0px, and some are 59px instead of 58px when cloned heh.
[10:14:45] <monk12> i took away the part of the code that sets width for entire row. not sure why not cloning perfectly.
[10:16:19] <BillCriswell> monk12: Are you loading images in the cells?
[10:16:46] <monk12> nope. i'll try to get an example up on jsfiddle as its a 5 cell table unlike the original example.
[10:17:05] <hlve> BILLAY. I need some halp!
[10:17:16] <theresajayne_> found the problem
[10:17:17] <Krambiorix> i want to create an associative array but the keys have spaces in it, it appears it's not possible. eg. myarray['test one'] = 1  ... Any alternatives?
[10:17:36] <hlve> http://pastebin.com/pF2DjtAh How would you combine this into a more organized function?
[10:17:38] <hlve> ;o
[10:17:41] <jop008> anyone used appcash and sqllite in combination with jQM?
[10:17:45] <theresajayne_> StopImmediatPropogation was preventing it on FF and IE due to them not supporting it
[10:18:12] <shoky> Krambiorix: it's possible for an object {} (which is an ass. array)
[10:18:41] <hlve> shoky. My hero!
[10:18:49] <shoky> hya trouter
[10:18:55] <hlve> sup homie.
[10:19:01] <shoky> woozy
[10:19:04] <shoky> sawp
[10:19:13] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: An array can't have keys in javascript. You would need ot use an object, like var o = {}; o['test one'] = 'foo';
[10:19:16] <hlve> trying to clean my code. it seems a bit excessive atm
[10:19:51] <BillCriswell> hlve: Is the HTML on lock down?
[10:19:59] <hlve> yessir.
[10:20:01] <shoky> i see you've put Bill on the job, should be cleared in no time
[10:20:06] <hlve> well, no
[10:20:14] <hlve> you mean, am I planning on changing it? Or can I?
[10:20:39] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, ow ok that's what i meant... when i want to do : o[variableoftestone]  , i get undefined....
[10:21:15] <Areckx> I am having a problem with nivo slider. It wasn't doing this on saturday, but for some reason it's doing this again: it will not load the image that you click on, and after you click on a second one, then it will load the first one you clicked :: http://symmetrypilates.net/studio/studio1.html (html : http://paste.ubuntu.com/5616582/) (css: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5616584/ )
[10:21:28] <monk12> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/7FhLh/ so if scroll can see how it doesnt take the exact width values for some reason... can think of any reason why?
[10:21:36] <Areckx> I need to remove some photos, but before i can do that, I need this to work correctly
[10:21:38] <BillCriswell> var o = {}, key = 'is weird', o[key] = 'foo'; o[key] should return foo just fine Krambiorix.
[10:22:05] <BillCriswell> hlve: I mean... maybe you could use the index?
[10:22:08] <monk12> But, they are set on the non-floating row on all table cells.
[10:23:05] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, okay, good to know, thanks again
[10:25:39] <shoky> hlve: can you change the html? also, paste it
[10:26:15] <monk12> maybe i need clone(true). i will try this out.
[10:26:55] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, then the mistake is here: http://jsfiddle.net/tXkMg/4/   but i cannot see what...
[10:27:40] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: Your comment at the bottom.
[10:27:56] <BillCriswell> It needs a // in front or /* */  around it.
[10:28:15] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, i just put it like that to show my point
[10:28:17] <monk12> didn't work, guess not heh.
[10:28:50] <Krambiorix> so the mistake would have something to with line11
[10:28:55] <hlve> hm. sec.
[10:31:01] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/tXkMg/5/
[10:32:09] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, did you change anything?
[10:32:48] <BillCriswell> I included jQuery, and removed the comment you didn't comment out.
[10:32:50] <shoky> Krambiorix:  seems to work fine, for simple strings at least.. http://jsfiddle.net/tXkMg/6/
[10:33:14] <shoky> Krambiorix:  what does 'names' have after the loop?
[10:33:22] <Krambiorix> shoky, names is filled
[10:35:37] <shoky> Krambiorix: what exactly does your comment there mean?
[10:35:49] <Krambiorix> shoelessone, hmmm i checked again, names also has the value of the last loop
[10:36:03] <shoky> maybe there is only one iteration? ;p
[10:36:09] <fruitwerks> hi all... I have a div (#fws) and in that I have sections with unique id's - I have them layered and only one shows at a time using z-index. What I need to figure out is how to get the visible section.
[10:36:37] <shoky> Krambiorix: or maybe all iterations give the same "val" after you split it and shit
[10:36:38] <Krambiorix> shoky, let's say the loop has to be performed 3 times. 1: aaa , 2: bbb, 3: ccc . the 2 arrays have the value 'ccc' and not also 'aaa' and 'bbb'
[10:38:41] <shoky> Krambiorix:  inside the loop.. do console.log(val);
[10:38:53] <shoky> do you actually see the 3 diff values
[10:39:14] <fruitwerks> $('#fws section') returns Object[section#rot_0, section#rot_1, section#rot_2, section#rot_3] - just need to know what section# is on top
[10:40:17] <monk12> yay got it to work BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/UJKFQ/2/  I just needed to move that code that set the width into the document.ready hehe.
[10:40:52] <Krambiorix> shoky, no i don't, it loops only one time... 10mins ago it looped 3 times
[10:40:54] <BillCriswell> monk12: Ah nice.
[10:41:09] <shoky> Krambiorix: ok then
[10:41:32] <BillCriswell> That's why I was asking about images. The width of the cells can change based on images not loading.
[10:42:24] <BillCriswell> I guess the text and line-breaks can effect it too.
[10:42:36] <BillCriswell> affect*
[10:42:49] <Krambiorix> shoky, ooow i see the problem... Jquery apparently keeps the last results of the autocomplete ul
[10:52:51] <Krambiorix> why won't this work? $(".ui-menu-item").find("a").click(function(){ ....
[10:53:03] <Krambiorix> should it be $(".ui-menu-item a").click(function(){
[10:56:44] <Z3R0> yo
[10:56:54] <Z3R0> Krambiorix second one
[10:57:28] <Krambiorix> Z3R0, so ui-menu-item is a <ul> element ... Is it still correct?
[10:57:47] <Z3R0> uh is a inside an li ?
[10:58:09] <Z3R0> ".ui-menu-item li a" or is <a href"#"><li> or <li><a href="#">
[10:59:01] <Krambiorix> Z3R0,  <ul> <li> <a href="#">
[10:59:06] <relipse> how do i remove draggability and droppability from one single element?
[10:59:34] <BillCriswell> relipse: .draggable('destroy') I think?
[11:05:43] <bambams> My colleagues have all taken to this style: $('body').on('click', '.some.selector', function() { ... }).on('click', '.some.other.selector', function() { ... })...
[11:06:20] <bambams> Instead of just: jQuery('.some.selector').click(fucntion() { ... }); jQuery('.some.other.selector').click(function() { ... }); ...
[11:06:30] <bambams> Is there any good reason for this?
[11:06:35] <cwatson> jQuery Image Slider: Anyone know how to make each image slide left to right? I've tried .show('slide', {direction: 'right'}; doesn't seem to work - http://jsfiddle.net/26qQb/1/
[11:06:55] <NoiseEee> bambams: the former ensures that newly added elements with the class .someSelector also fire the event handler
[11:06:58] <relipse> bambams: sounds silly
[11:07:04] <NoiseEee> bambams: the latter only sets them for the current DOM elements
[11:07:20] <Areckx> I am having a problem with nivo slider. It wasn't doing this on saturday, but for some reason it's doing this again: it will not load the image that you click on, and after you click on a second one, then it will load the first one you clicked :: http://symmetrypilates.net/studio/studio1.html (html : http://paste.ubuntu.com/5616582/) (css: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5616584/ )
[11:08:10] <relipse> I have an issue, i have a draggable treeview type feature, but i want leaf nodes to no longer be droppable, how do i turn off drag droppability for my whole tree so i can then reset it all?
[11:09:59] <bambams> NoiseEee: NoiseEee The docs seem to say that it only affects elements that exist when the code fires.
[11:10:53] <bambams> NoiseEee: No, nevermind. It goes on to confusing say not for delegated elements.
[11:10:57] <NoiseEee> bambams: events bubble.  if you attach events in the latter way, they will only affect elements already in the DOM.  with the former, <body> is watching the events, and when a newly added element with .someSelector is added, it bubbles up to <body>
[11:11:02] <bambams> I'd say the API and/or documentation needs revision.
[11:11:45] <relipse> I have an issue, i have a draggable treeview type feature, but i want leaf nodes to no longer be droppable, how do i turn off drag droppability for my whole tree so i can then reset it all? I tried to disable the droppable aspect for a specific element but its not seeming to work: cannot call methods on droppable prior to initialization
[11:12:06] <relipse> is there a jqueryui channel?
[11:17:02] <cwatson> Not that I know of. This chat says UI.
[11:18:12] <cwatson> Does anyone know why these are working differently? Same code - http://jsfiddle.net/26qQb/1/ vs https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/77127384/contentSlider2/index.html
[11:20:47] <NoiseEee> cwatson: your fiddle is missing several closing )
[11:21:05] <NoiseEee> cwatson: a decent IDE (and even JSFIDDLE ITSELF) clearly would show it / shows it
[11:21:13] <NoiseEee> cwatson: http://jsfiddle.net/26qQb/2/
[11:21:29] <cwatson> Did you check the Dropbox?
[11:21:47] <NoiseEee> what about it?
[11:22:06] <cwatson> It shows a partial image between slides
[11:22:17] <NoiseEee> cwatson: id check your CSS.
[11:22:57] <cwatson> Hmmm, I don't see what I could change. I'll look into it. Thank you NoiseEee.
[11:24:54] <rainabba> An ajax call is returning a dynamically generated iFrame that's getting added to the DOM. That iFrame includes <script src> blocks and one of those calls $(document).ready() but it's not firing in IE. I've been googling and only finding very nasty looking hacks and I suspect theres a much safer way to go about this. The same code works as expected in Chrome. Suggestions?
[11:25:17] <SmokingSlim> masters of jquery, is there a way to target data-attribues on click ? ie: $('a').attr('attr').on('click', function) ?
[11:25:51] <rainabba> SmokingSlim: How would a user click on an attribute?
[11:26:02] <relipse> how do i get the first child span?
[11:26:12] <relipse> of an $element
[11:26:15] <rainabba> relipse: [1]
[11:26:15] <BillCriswell> SmokingSlim: Yes. $('a').on('click', function(){ var $this = $(this); console.log( $this.data('foo') ); });
[11:26:35] <relipse> rainabba: how so?
[11:26:35] <SmokingSlim> rainabba I just want the click-function to respond only if it has a specific attribute value
[11:26:39] <BillCriswell> relipse: span:first-child could work.
[11:27:03] <BillCriswell> SmokingSlim: Ah, $('a[data-foo]').on('click', fn );
[11:27:17] <SmokingSlim> BillCriswell wzuuuuuup. thanks dude :)
[11:27:55] <rainabba> SmokingSlim: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[11:28:07] <Croves> Does anyone know why I keep getting this 'Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ('? It's a simple line of code: $(this).closest('td').prev('td').('.mostra_email_hiden').toggle();
[11:28:39] <madprops> will closest() go inside every element upwards to find what i'm looking for?
[11:28:52] <rainabba> Croves: If that is accurate, the issue is likely just prior to that line of code.
[11:28:53] <BillCriswell> madprops: Yup.
[11:29:46] <BillCriswell> Croves: Your code is weird... Do you have $(this).closest('td').prev('td').('.mostra_email_hiden').toggle() ?
[11:30:02] <Croves> rainabba: My function is just this line :P
[11:30:26] <BillCriswell> If you're looking for somethin inside that td you'd want to use .find()
[11:30:33] <Croves> BillCriswell: I agree, it's very odd. Let me show you my HTML
[11:31:02] <Croves> Here: http://pastebin.com/1LhUvg2t
[11:31:32] <Croves> When I click in img.mostra_email_header, I need to toggle the div.mostra_email_hiden
[11:31:36] <necaris> aloha folks. can anyone help me figure out why caching the result of $element.offset() doesn't work?
[11:31:55] <BillCriswell> is img.mostr_email_header "this"?
[11:32:10] <Croves> Oh, sorry BillCriswell. I forgot that detail
[11:32:31] <Croves> Yes, the trigger event is .mostra_email_header onclick
[11:33:23] <Croves> I was trying to use closest('mostra_email_hiden'), but I didn't get the result as I expected
[11:33:27] <BillCriswell> $(this).closest('td').prev('td').find('.mostra_email_hiden').toggle() I think is what you want.
[11:33:49] <BillCriswell> Well, it's not a parent of it so it wouldn't.
[11:34:26] <Croves> Oh yes, exactly BillCriswell. Thank you very much!
[11:34:29] <Croves> It's working now =)
[11:34:37] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[11:37:19] <Areckx> I am having a problem with nivo slider. It wasn't doing this on saturday, but for some reason it's doing this again: it will not load the image that you click on, and after you click on a second one, then it will load the first one you clicked :: http://symmetrypilates.net/studio/studio1.html (html : http://paste.ubuntu.com/5616582/) (css: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5616584/ )
[11:40:01] <NoiseEee> Areckx:  did you recently update to 1.9.1 ?
[11:41:19] <Areckx> yes, I have tried this with all of the versions of jquery available on the page and only this one works
[11:41:25] <Areckx> NoiseEee::
[11:42:00] <Areckx> I implemented this with the latest version of the google CDN, and tried 1.9.1 to see if it would fix this issue, but it is behaving the same way NoiseEee
[11:42:22] <NoiseEee> using 'latest version' on a CDN is terrible, as it actually changes right?
[11:42:35] <NoiseEee> Areckx: is there anything about Nivo supporting 1.9.x?  does 1.8 work?
[11:43:05] <tidalwav1> Hi all, looking into a problem with outerWidth()/outerHeight() in 2.0 (might be in 1.9 also.) Seeing the behavior written about in this bug http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12293 but **only when calling these functions without the optional parameter on elements appearing inside an iframe**.
[11:43:21] <Areckx> it says it uses 1.7 but I tried using 1.7.1 and 1.7.2 and neither worked
[11:43:28] <tidalwav1> Does anyone know if this is expected behavior or if a bug is already logged for it (I couldn't find one?)
[11:44:21] <NoiseEee> Areckx: well i'd hit up the Nivo forums or something, good luck.
[11:45:29] <Areckx> NoiseEee::  I just switched it to jquery 1.7 and it looks like this http://symmetrypilates.net/studio/studio1.html
[11:45:36] <Areckx> I've been searching stackoverflow
[11:47:12] <Areckx> oh duhr.. I didn't upload to server o_O
[11:47:29] <tidalwav1> anyone? :'(
[11:48:01] <Areckx> same issue
[11:50:19] <memres> anyone know of a way to detect if popups are allowed in Chrome, everything I've tried has failed
[11:57:11] <cwd> I'm looking for a contractor for a jquery job.. not sure the best place to look, any suggestions?
[11:57:20] <Z3R0> probably here?

[12:00:14] <ajpiano> he was certianly not my boy!

[12:04:35] <kosibar> I have a jQuery object representing a new element that hasn't yet been inserted. How can I get a jQuery object of a child element of that parent object?
[12:06:04] <BillCriswell> var $newElement = $('<div><span>Moo</span></div>'), $newElementsSpan = $newElement.find('span'); should work kosibar.
[12:06:17] <kosibar> Thanks!
[12:06:41] <kosibar> That works perfectly!
[12:10:48] <BillCriswell> Sweeeeeeet.
[12:13:29] <webaholic> Afternoon. I'm back with my box for another question. http://jsfiddle.net/3fT5A/  I've purposefully capped my sliding box to have a height that requires scrolling. However, the scroll bars don't appear during the slide toggle. Is there something else I have to do to allow the bars to show?
[12:19:30] <memres> overflow-y: scroll !important;
[12:19:43] <memres> updated it
[12:22:05] <madprops> this is so weird. I'm trying to send an element's parent but for some reason I keep sending the element itself
[12:22:29] <webaholic> memres: huh. wonder why the important is needed here.
[12:23:07] <memres> b/c it gets overflow: hidden during animation
[12:24:25] <webaholic> ...right. I forgot to debug during that
[12:26:01] <NoiseEee> madprops: yeah weird!!!
[12:28:27] <madprops> my bad It's working ok
[12:33:10] <bricker> Which would be faster: $(this).find(".title"), or $(".title", this) ?
[12:33:33] <Z3R0> i dunno benchmark it ?
[12:34:29] <bricker> Z3R0: you have been very helpful,
[12:34:38] <Z3R0> not a problem :)
[12:43:38] <jagjr> HI guys, everytime i try and close my overlay div it keeps coming back.. any help? http://jsfiddle.net/eEV5X/
[12:43:55] <bluesm> If I've added
[12:44:19] <bluesm> the elements to the html via jquery and then I want to get this element
[12:44:25] <bluesm> And traverse up to the DOM.
[12:44:27] <bluesm> Could I ?
[12:44:47] <bluesm> It seems to me that I could only traverse what I've inserted ...
[12:45:03] <pSouper_> hi all, having a problem with jquery-ui sortables - when i sort an li appears to work but on update: it errors... "Error: cannot call methods on sortable prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'serialize'"
[12:45:44] <pSouper_> if have a jsfiddle on my problem if you'd not mind taking a peek (it's by mighty nice of y'oll) http://jsfiddle.net/8NNMW/2/
[12:48:16] <jagjr> Can anyone help? http://jsfiddle.net/eEV5X/
[12:49:27] <pSouper> whats the prob there jagjr
[12:49:37] <Z3R0> ah
[12:49:41] <Z3R0> who posted the modal issue ?
[12:49:49] <vladikoff> pSouper, wait you have 2 problems?
[12:50:01] <pSouper> 2?
[12:50:22] <pSouper> if you mention my mm as one we will fall out vladikoff ;)
[12:50:23] <Z3R0> "modalShow" is a class on the <div> HTML CODE </div> it is wrapping the ENTIRE content, and thus any click on the "X" is also triggering a click on the .modalShow thus it's hiding and reshowing
[12:50:27] <YammYcoding> hello folks!
[12:51:37] <pSouper> vladikoff: although i have a $.post & $.ajax I was only using one/other
[12:52:00] <pSouper> ah, and i lefth in '$( "#sortable" ).disableSelection();'
[12:52:15] <pSouper> but thesis not part of my problem i don't think
[12:52:42] <YammYcoding> guys, i have this array { idproduct,size,price }. I need to show a <select> that display sizes where id is prodid, and when i change it, the price changes on a side label. How can I arrange that in js ?
[12:52:50] <jagjr> I see, I changed that to the spans and that works great! Cheers
[12:53:29] <Z3R0> YammYcoding please post your html code on a fiddle jsfiddle.net and we can help with the js
[12:53:48] <YammYcoding> i'm thinking out loud first
[12:53:56] <YammYcoding> all i have is the array
[12:54:19] <Z3R0> so you need to create select from an array
[12:54:27] <Z3R0> and then work off that select
[12:54:39] <Z3R0> how is the array formed? because in your case there's it's a single element
[12:54:52] <Z3R0> is it array(array(id,size,price), array(id,size,price)) ?
[12:55:06] <YammYcoding> it's $sizes with many items in.
[12:55:11] <YammYcoding> each of that is one item
[12:55:12] <Z3R0> ah ok
[12:55:14] <haizum> i'm trying to add keys to an object in a loop using prizesObj[year][production][title] = []; and for some reason the [title] key is being overwritten by the last one, despite them being unique. any idea why?
[12:55:18] <Z3R0> so sizes is the extra array
[12:55:31] <YammYcoding> it's the container of each $size
[12:55:51] <YammYcoding> it's not exactly a size, it's a 3 value-group
[12:56:15] <Z3R0> yea I figured
[12:56:17] <Z3R0> small, medium, large?
[12:56:18] <Z3R0> lolz
[12:56:21] <YammYcoding> ya
[12:56:48] <YammYcoding> each prod have one size, with a price for this size.
[12:56:55] <Z3R0> so is price part of sizees?
[12:56:59] <Z3R0> or is it 1 price, either size?
[12:57:36] <YammYcoding> it's like pizza cheese,big,10.00    pizza cheese,small,5.00    pizza cheese med 7.50
[12:57:47] <YammYcoding> the <select shows   big,small,med.
[12:57:56] <Z3R0> so price is referenced by size
[12:58:05] <YammYcoding> and the price might change acording to the size , and i need to know which productid it belongs to
[12:58:07] <Z3R0> so both size and price are more
[12:58:08] <Z3R0> got it ;)
[12:58:41] <YammYcoding> I will post the form , and the prodid must go somehow attached to the size chosen
[12:59:09] <YammYcoding> i can put prodid as id in the size select, maybe
[12:59:12] <pSouper> vladikoff: did you sopt 2 problems with my jsFiddle or were you just asking if I had 2 proboems?
[12:59:29] <Z3R0> so wait, why wouldn't you know the prodid ?
[12:59:33] <YammYcoding> but where i'd store the size to show it in a side label?
[12:59:46] <YammYcoding> the price*
[13:00:15] <YammYcoding> like.  <select id=pid1><option>small</option>
[13:00:19] <YammYcoding> no
[13:00:32] <YammYcoding> <select><option id=pid1>small</option>
[13:00:45] <Croves> I have a table with 2 rows. In the first cell of the first row I have a button. When the user click this button, I need to save the text of the first cell in the seccond row and hide these two rows. Any idea?
[13:00:46] <Z3R0> ah
[13:00:55] <YammYcoding> but where price could go? can i invent an atribute in the <option> maybe?
[13:01:06] <Z3R0> wouldn't need to go anywhere
[13:01:12] <Z3R0> get the array index of size
[13:01:16] <Z3R0> and match it to array index of price
[13:02:08] <YammYcoding> hm but the 3 values are in the same index
[13:02:17] <Z3R0> how so ?
[13:02:24] <YammYcoding> its size[0] = { 1, 'small', 10.00 )
[13:02:30] <Z3R0> ah
[13:02:41] <Z3R0> in that case...
[13:02:45] <YammYcoding> size[1] = { 2, 'med', 15.00 }
[13:03:03] <Z3R0> hmmm
[13:03:08] <Z3R0> what's the 1,2,3 for ?
[13:03:11] <Z3R0> id's for sizes?
[13:03:15] <YammYcoding> its prod id
[13:03:20] <Z3R0> ah ok
[13:03:28] <YammYcoding> needed to include in the order table.
[13:03:39] <Z3R0> do you have any of these arrays already setup, so I can tinker :)
[13:03:41] <Z3R0> I'm bored
[13:03:41] <YammYcoding> i made it denormalized at the prod table. to simplify
[13:04:26] <YammYcoding> i have the json still
[13:04:29] <NoiseEee> YammYcoding: there's nothing stopping you from doing <option value='someValue' data-price='15.00'>Cool thing!</option>
[13:04:30] <YammYcoding> http://yammy.com.br/sandbox/api/mobile/getproducts/?store=1
[13:04:31] <Z3R0> that works
[13:04:42] <Z3R0> shhh NoiseEee
[13:04:43] <Z3R0> lol
[13:04:45] <YammYcoding> rofl
[13:04:58] <YammYcoding> but i use zepto.js i think there is no data thing, there is?
[13:05:24] <YammYcoding> i need to change the pizza view to deal with this json instead of the older one
[13:08:21] <NoiseEee> why ask a zepto.js question in jquery?
[13:08:21] <YammYcoding>  let me try change the js to display this json instead of the old one. then we can play with the price label :)
[13:08:27] <NoiseEee> wtf
[13:08:36] <YammYcoding> zepto is a mini jquery
[13:08:46] <YammYcoding> and they are mute in that 6 people channel
[13:08:52] <Z3R0> but without full knowledge of what it has and doesn't have it's still a mute point
[13:09:03] <Z3R0> sounds like zepto is outdated if you can't get support
[13:09:08] <NoiseEee> YammYcoding: it actually has nothing to do with jquery.
[13:09:13] <NoiseEee> so don't ask zepto questions in here.
[13:09:30] <YammYcoding> i'm asking the jquery concept.
[13:10:03] <NoiseEee> wasting time.
[13:10:34] <YammYcoding> just abstract the zepto stuff..
[13:11:23] <YammYcoding> imagine that you speak jquery i convert to zepto internally.
[13:12:21] <YammYcoding> Z3R0 hold on, i wil try update the html for you see the view for that json :)
[13:16:31] <Brodingo> does toggling multiple classes just not work in 1.3.2? http://jsfiddle.net/Brodingo/WfTM8/
[13:17:46] <acidjazz> NoiseEee: you TELL EM
[13:17:51] <Z3R0> Brodingo the fiddle won't update the html code
[13:18:43] <Brodingo> Z3R0 mmhmm
[13:18:57] <YammYcoding> how i know what exactly is the ajax error here? http://yammy.com.br/phonegap/helloworld/
[13:19:37] <Z3R0> lol no, I mean it WONT update
[13:19:43] <Z3R0> jsfiddle doesn't change those values
[13:20:26] <NoiseEee> YammYcoding: probably has something to do with sticking a var_dump where none should be???
[13:20:32] <Brodingo> Z3R0 i dont think you understand....
[13:20:37] <NoiseEee> http://yammy.com.br/sandbox/api/mobile/getproducts/?store=1 @ Z3R0
[13:20:55] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/WfTM8/1/
[13:21:01] <Z3R0> it works just fine :) Brodingo multiple classes
[13:21:06] <Z3R0> you won't see the HTML change
[13:21:09] <YammYcoding> oh you're right the vardumo hold on! rofl
[13:21:12] <Z3R0> so you can't tell if your classes are toggling or not
[13:22:20] <YammYcoding> ah okey, without vardump it partially works.
[13:22:32] <YammYcoding> now gotta tweak the array matching, brb.
[13:22:49] <Brodingo> Z3R0 inspecting the html or console clearly show the classes arent toggling
[13:23:11] <Z3R0> well they toggled on the fiddle I just wrote you...
[13:23:38] <Brodingo> http://jsfiddle.net/Brodingo/WfTM8/2/
[13:24:16] <Brodingo> something is fishy
[13:24:25] <Z3R0> hmmm interesting
[13:24:29] <Z3R0> they don't toggle off...
[13:24:34] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/WfTM8/3/
[13:24:47] <Z3R0> they toggle on just fine, but not off
[13:25:04] <Brodingo> have to separate the calls
[13:25:10] <Brodingo> doesnt do multiples right
[13:25:31] <Brodingo> phew i am not crazy
[13:26:04] <Z3R0> well...
[13:26:09] <Z3R0> according to the docs it does though
[13:26:15] <Z3R0> there is a perfect example of it
[13:26:21] <Brodingo> yep, 1.0
[13:26:26] <Brodingo> i even used the example
[13:27:03] <Z3R0> oh no
[13:27:09] <Z3R0> looks like they readded the class after toggle
[13:27:16] <Z3R0> with appendClass
[13:27:32] <Z3R0> $('button').on('click', function() {
[13:27:32] <Z3R0>   var tc = this.className || undefined;
[13:27:32] <Z3R0>   divs.toggleClass(tc);
[13:27:32] <Z3R0>   appendClass();
[13:27:32] <Z3R0> });
[13:27:40] <Z3R0> they removed the classes with toggle() and then reAppended

[13:31:38] <royalty> hello
[13:31:42] <royalty> I am curious
[13:31:46] <royalty> in an ajax request
[13:32:11] <royalty> is it possible to have a php file and instead give it a different ending in the request and expect regular results?
[13:32:17] <royalty> so like
[13:32:43] <royalty> jQuery.ajax({ url:foobar.phtml instead of
[13:32:45] <edoop> anyone want collaborate to a work?
[13:32:57] <royalty> jQuery.ajax({url:foobar.php
[13:33:05] <royalty> or would ajax just now work in that case
[13:33:16] <royalty> not*
[13:33:21] <Z3R0> ajax will work with anything
[13:33:24] <amph1bius> i think it would work with anything
[13:33:27] <Z3R0> doesn't have be .php
[13:33:27] <royalty> oh
[13:33:37] <royalty> but will it still render it as php?
[13:33:41] <Z3R0> like jsfiddle uses ajax but retrieves a json object from a .txt file
[13:33:42] <royalty> hmmmm
[13:33:45] <Z3R0> render as php ?
[13:33:46] <royalty> okay I'll give it a try
[13:33:47] <royalty> yeah
[13:33:48] <royalty> like
[13:33:52] <royalty> will it still act like a php
[13:33:56] <Z3R0> that depends how you put you are outputting it to the browser
[13:33:59] <royalty> I see
[13:34:02] <Z3R0> not on the information requested via ajax
[13:34:46] <NoiseEee> royalty: it doesn't matter what kind of file you make your ajax request to... just the reponse matters
[13:35:41] <supsup> what if you make it a non-string?
[13:36:50] <supsup> NoiseEee what are you up to?
[13:36:56] <NoiseEee> workin
[13:37:00] <supsup> word
[13:49:33] <royalty> what is the base of an ajax url?
[13:49:46] <royalty> is it the site web folder?
[13:49:52] <royalty> or the server web folder
[13:49:54] <royalty> rather
[13:52:44] <YammYcoding> guys why this page shows ajax error sometimes, and sometimes it works? (try pressing F5 several times) http://yammy.com.br/phonegap/helloworld/
[13:53:08] <YammYcoding> i wonder what the exact ajax error might be.
[13:55:56] <boytoy> Hi, if I have a function inside a function, how do I call "this" from the first function?
[13:56:03] <boytoy> I.e. the "this" of ".baz" should be from ".foo" -- $(".foo").each(function() { $(".bar", this).click(function() { $(".baz", this).show();
[13:56:23] <royalty> YammYcoding: ohhh signore you wanta open upa your owna pizzaria?
[13:56:48] <boytoy> nice, phonegap
[13:56:52] <clov3r> yammycoding: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1023867/jquery-xmlhttprequest-error
[13:56:59] <supsup> YammYcoding: no resposne
[13:58:21] <NoiseEee> YammYcoding: have you ever heard of the "console"?
[13:59:09] <clov3r> boytoy: the this in .baz will be the .bar + the current .foo
[13:59:32] <clov3r> you can then filter the .foo
[13:59:42] <clov3r> and are left with the original this
[13:59:45] <clov3r> i think
[14:00:21] <boytoy> clov3r: Wait hold up :)
[14:00:51] <boytoy> clov3r: Basically I want to call .foo's this from inside .bar
[14:01:16] <boytoy> Would a simple $(".baz", ".foo") suffice?
[14:01:27] <clov3r> probably not
[14:01:37] <boytoy> Dang :/
[14:01:42] <clov3r> if you want the specific .foo from that each
[14:01:45] <clov3r> but...
[14:01:49] <boytoy> Wang boom diddely bang
[14:01:53] <clov3r> if that's all you're doing in the each loop
[14:02:03] <clov3r> you don't need the each loop
[14:02:29] <boytoy> hmm
[14:03:26] <BillCriswell> Boomhauer?
[14:04:56] <clov3r> i'm not sure what you're trying to do exactly there boytoy
[14:05:22] <boytoy> lemme put up a fiddle real quick
[14:05:29] * boytoy lights up a clover cigarette
[14:05:35] <boytoy> those are real nice btw
[14:05:41] <eager> boytoy: something like this?  $('.foo .bar').click(function() { $(this).siblings('.baz').show(); });
[14:05:54] <supsup> NoiseEee do you ever use this Zepto lib?
[14:05:59] <NoiseEee> supsup: god no
[14:06:02] <supsup> looks weird.
[14:06:04] <supsup> to me
[14:06:04] <boytoy> eager: ooh that one looks nice!
[14:06:09] <supsup> lol i was looking at it from that guys page
[14:06:27] <snorti> when i run fast through my icons from right to left in the #navi i get a damn bug.. the #wrapper > div dont hide.. http://tinyurl.com/c9lff8v any idear how to fix that ?
[14:08:36] <eager> snorti: first of all I think I would position: absolute; those fading divs, so that if this happens they show aat the same place
[14:08:53] <eager> and then I would look into fixing the original issue
[14:09:21] <eager> ... about which I just recently read something, but let me try to remember
[14:10:02] <supsup> eager: have you noticed chrome not reacting to hidden divs when developer tools are open/
[14:10:22] <eager> reacting like what
[14:10:28] <supsup> like in that guys example
[14:10:35] <supsup> if i have dev tools open
[14:10:42] <supsup> none of the hidden divs show when you hover
[14:10:47] <supsup> noticed it for other navs too
[14:10:48] <eager> nope, I was looking at it in ff :)
[14:11:14] <supsup> ah alright
[14:11:37] <eager> you mean that nordquest.eu?
[14:11:48] <supsup> ya
[14:12:00] <supsup> in other menu systems too wondering if my chrome is just jacked up
[14:12:15] <eager> it does the same thing for me in Chromium either with devtools or without...
[14:12:27] <supsup> yah guess mine is busted, don't get it
[14:12:35] <n00bAlert> good day everybody. As my name implies I'm a total n00b to javascript but I read that jQuery can do what I need. Thing is, I can't seem to get it working. It's for a wordpress site, I know that can make a difference.
[14:12:50] <boytoy> eager, clov3r -- http://jsfiddle.net/CjKV5/ -- basically if I do $(".bar", this).show(); it will assume I mean .bar from the current function and not the parent function -- does that make sense?
[14:13:24] <boytoy> If I do $(".foo .bar").show(); it will open all the .bars and I can't have that :)
[14:14:36] <n00bAlert> So here's what I'm trying for. I've got a div with a class of slider-wrapper. In CSS it needs to be set to a fixed size of 410px so it renders properly on load and I'd like to get JQuery to set the height to auto as soon as the page completed loading.  The following is the code I've been trying
[14:14:56] <n00bAlert> JQuery(document).ready(function() {     JQuery(".slider-wrapper").height("auto")   };
[14:15:19] <Z3R0> $('.slider-wrapper').css('height','auto'); ?
[14:15:37] <snorti> hm
[14:16:16] <snorti> eager: i done the position:absolute
[14:16:49] <snorti> eager: but my jquery code seems to be not state of the art for this.. do you indeed that?
[14:17:02] <NoiseEee> boytoy: http://jsfiddle.net/CjKV5/1/
[14:17:02] <supsup> boytoy: why do u use a submenu in a li?  why not put a new ul inside the li?
[14:17:12] <NoiseEee> boytoy: way too much code for what you want to achieve
[14:17:17] <eager> snorti: give me a minute, I'll try to find an article
[14:18:00] <n00bAlert> Z3R0: didn't do it.
[14:18:05] <boytoy> NoiseEee: wow that's amazing..
[14:18:08] <boytoy> bless!
[14:18:17] <supsup> still odd markup
[14:18:20] <supsup> imo
[14:18:26] <boytoy> supsup: what do you mean? i am putting a new ul inside a li
[14:18:56] <boytoy> oh wait i see what you mean
[14:19:01] <supsup> seems odd to not have a new ul inside the li
[14:19:02] <n00bAlert> I've set up a jsFiddle to target a diff attribute just to see where the problem might be: http://jsfiddle.net/PSZUr/
[14:19:08] <supsup> instead of making a new li
[14:19:10] <boytoy> yeah that is odd :)
[14:19:21] <boytoy> thanks for noticing man
[14:19:48] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/PSZUr/1/ // your code works fine if you close tags properly
[14:19:50] <supsup> class would then just be on the li, and u could have a css rule
[14:19:54] <Z3R0> n00bAlert ^
[14:19:58] <boytoy> :D
[14:19:59] <supsup> and then your js becomes even shorter
[14:20:09] <eager> boytoy: http://jsfiddle.net/L32jj/1/
[14:20:50] <boytoy> eager: not bad that one either! any advantages using that over NoiseEee's?
[14:21:19] <supsup> NoiseEee is better for 1.9+jquery
[14:21:26] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/PSZUr/2/ // height also works fine
[14:21:27] <eager> I haven't seen that one yet, digging an article up for snorti right now :)
[14:21:36] <supsup> or 1.8
[14:21:38] <Z3R0> n00bAlert ^ chances are you have an error in your syntax somewhere, check console
[14:21:38] <n00bAlert> syntax melts my brain, at least I know I'm on the right track. Thank you :)
[14:21:49] <supsup> whenever .on was added
[14:21:57] <supsup> 1.7
[14:22:06] <supsup> also don't use jquery to hide stuff...
[14:22:07] <supsup> use css
[14:22:09] <boytoy> kewl
[14:22:12] <supsup> if it's inital state
[14:22:17] <snorti> eager: :)
[14:22:20] <boytoy> supsup: there we go http://jsfiddle.net/CjKV5/2/
[14:22:24] <eager> snorti: http://css-tricks.com/full-jquery-animations/ and this: http://css-tricks.com/examples/jQueryStop/
[14:22:32] <boytoy> she is looking *MIGHTY* fine ;)
[14:22:41] <eager> I would spend time to investigate these
[14:22:47] <snorti> ok
[14:22:48] <snorti> thx
[14:22:48] <supsup> boytoy: don't use inline styles
[14:22:55] <boytoy> and she's all mine muhahahaha
[14:23:08] <boytoy> supsup: cool, yeah thats probably a good idea
[14:23:27] <supsup> but yeah...also now u can nest futher
[14:23:28] <eager> http://jsfiddle.net/CjKV5/2/ wow, how nice
[14:23:41] <n00bAlert> will that set-up calculate the new height after the initial rendering or before the browser gets a chance to lay it out?
[14:24:05] <Z3R0> dunno
[14:24:11] <Z3R0> you could delay the event if you wanted?
[14:24:31] <boytoy> eager: oh for sure!
[14:25:11] <n00bAlert> I would want, got a link to something I can read about that?
[14:27:29] <edoop> hei , need to inspire at trypewriter with some smoot Y fade effect
[14:27:47] <edoop> have a idea if is it possible with availability on browser
[14:27:51] <edoop> i'ma a actionscript developer
[14:28:04] <edoop> don't migrate to full javascript
[14:28:16] <clov3r> n00balert: use window.load instead of document.ready to delay loading until images have arrived
[14:28:17] <edoop> but i understand some of strong code
[14:28:27] <edoop> is the same.
[14:29:31] <edoop> i ve good opportunity to earn my experience
[14:29:33] <edoop> :)
[14:29:43] <edoop> with soldi base of scripting oop .
[14:30:11] <n00bAlert> clov3r: thank you

[14:32:26] <boytoy> Nice one ;)
[14:32:58] <eager> supsup++

[14:40:16] <stu7> a

[14:41:44] <supsup> just cause i was bored: http://jsfiddle.net/CjKV5/4/
[14:47:53] <Mac_> Hey guys, do any of you know where I can start to find a decent custom php programmer for a project?
[14:48:15] <boytoy> supsup: hehe thats funny
[14:49:43] <boytoy> supsup: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnq5ktoApFA :))
[14:50:01] <supsup> Mac_: php channel, job sites etc
[14:51:16] <Mac_> its confusing, how do i word myself not to get someone who just does wordpress and lists php as a skill
[14:51:53] <Mac_> because im only finding people who promise stuff this way, and not the actual programmers
[14:52:29] <supsup> get someone with a Computer Science degree from a good uni, that says they know php.
[14:52:34] <supsup> Pay more money perhaps works too
[14:53:34] <supsup> it's always a gamble when you hire someone new.  Increase your odds.  In the interview ask them valid hard php questions, if you don't know how to find a php expert and contract them to do you interviews
[14:53:41] <supsup> i don't know, it's not really a Jquery question though
[14:54:11] <supsup> far far removed from jquery pretty sure it's against channels rules to ask in here off topic non-related questions they will soon send out a bot to get you prob.
[14:56:09] <clov3r> was that intentionally recursive too supsup? if you don't know how to find a php expert and contract them to do you interviews
[14:56:12] <clov3r> :P
[14:56:42] <supsup> you might be able to find an expert to to contract to do interviews but does not want to work
[14:56:46] <supsup> for peanuts
[14:56:54] <clov3r> sure :D

[14:58:05] <snorti> danheberden: only kick?
[14:58:12] <supsup> the main issue when people complain about not finding good coders, often has nothing to do with finding them...it's what they are willing to pay for it.  They only have a small budget so they can only hire intro coders...who don't know much.  So then they train them up right and they finally get good...and they go get a better paying job.
[14:58:23] * tw2113 kicks danheberden til dan kicks back
[14:58:58] <clov3r> oh its a harsh world
[14:59:03] <supsup> i know right
[14:59:19] <tw2113> bring it js developer! bring down the fury on my soul
[14:59:38] <tw2113> you don't code jQuery good!
[15:00:22] <dualcore> what was that
[15:00:30] <Z3R0> it was a lot of ]'s
[15:00:38] <tw2113> a bunch of cobol dualcore
[15:02:21] <supsup> anyone else order a beaglebone black
[15:13:37] <boytoy> supsup: whats that?
[15:18:21] <supsup> open hardware single baord computer, costs like 45$, can run nodejs and such.  Gotta roll out of here.  Later
[15:26:59] <reybango> hola danheberden
[15:36:35] <tw2113> man, i was hoping danheberden would literally kick me out of the room
[15:38:21] <danheberden> reybango: yo
[15:38:37] <danheberden> :D
[15:38:37] <tw2113> damn, close enough
[15:39:19] <tw2113> that'll do
[15:42:02] <relipse> how do i get the first element
[15:42:06] <relipse> .at(0) didnt work
[15:43:25] <relipse> .get(0)
[15:43:40] <tw2113> .index()
[15:45:31] <shesek> relipse, as a dom element, or as a jquery-wrapped dom element?
[15:45:45] <shesek> .get(0) or simply [0] for the dom element, .eq(0) for a jquery object
[15:51:44] <madprops> can  I append something to a variable containing html?
[15:51:56] <madprops> specifically a handlebars template
[15:52:13] <Keavon> on www.keavon.com I am using jQuery to animate the height of my containing div. For some reason, while the animation happens, there is white blocking the right part of the text. I can't figure out why it does that. Can anybody take a look please?
[15:52:32] <tw2113> danheberden is my favorite heberden!
[15:52:39] <garciawebdev> madprops sure: variable + '<p>hello</p>' (basic string concatenation)
[15:53:31] <madprops> garciawebdev, you're right. What I meant to say was actually if I can select an element inside that html variable, then append something to it.
[15:54:25] <garciawebdev> madprops: no, but what you can do is store in the variables the elements instead of the strings
[15:54:50] <garciawebdev> that way you can append to some sub-element and then append that group to the DOM
[15:56:16] <garciawebdev> but that should be after you evaluate the Handlebars template
[15:56:25] <garciawebdev> (because it works with plain HTML)
[15:58:07] <garciawebdev> so: yourElements = yourHandlebarsTemplate(context); $(yourElements).find('something').append($otherElement); $(yourElements).appendTo('#yourContainer');
[15:58:24] <garciawebdev> madprops i think it should work that way
[15:58:28] <eager> Keavon: try #content with 650px width instead of 630
[15:59:08] <madprops> garciawebdev, cool i'll try that
[15:59:18] <Keavon> eager: it still has the white part on the side when it's 650
[15:59:33] <eager> Keavon: I entered this into Chrome dev tools, so that i have time to analyze: $("#content").animate({height:($("#page-").height() + 30)}, 30000);
[15:59:47] <eager> interesting
[16:00:29] <Keavon> setting #content to something much less, like 500, still does it from the side of the text
[16:01:38] <eager> ahhha, there is an overflow:hidden on it during the animation, i learned it here earlier today, and now I see it in devtools indeed
[16:03:30] <eager> #page-home has a 20px left padding and 100% width; this will be 20px wider than the parent #content
[16:04:01] <eager> and #content is overflow: hidden by the anim
[16:04:51] <eager> Keavon: try removing the 20px left padding from #page-home, and put it on #content... or also, put it on as left margin...
[16:07:55] <eager> timetogo2bed
[16:07:58] <eager> o/
[16:09:54] <Keavon> I can't find what makes the right padding or margin
[16:10:02] <Sna4x8> I have some SVG polygons with mouse(over|leave) events tied to them.  Each polygon has a SVG text element on top of it.  When the mouse goes over the text element, mouseleave fires: http://jsfiddle.net/rhJGD/
[16:10:06] <Sna4x8> Any way to prevent that?
[16:10:11] <Keavon> oh right, nothing does
[16:10:16] <Keavon> it floats to the side
[16:13:17] <YammYcoding> guys how i add a click event for the .size <select> ? I tried $('.size').click( function(), but didn't go
[16:14:46] <YammYcoding> this inside a document ready also didn't go
[16:15:11] <Keavon> Thanks for the help, I'll keep working to fix the padding part
[16:15:56] <slide263> Hi i need help with a slideshow I am trying to put on my web page. http://dpaste.com/1078645/ links to my code if that helps. I got the js to show an orange line in my wrapper but I don't know how/where to put my pictures or how to make the slide show work.
[16:16:18] <slide263> This is the site my slideshow comes from http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/simplegallery.htm
[16:16:36] <hhuuggoo> Is there a way to make a deferred resolve according to another deferred?  basically, I have a function that either executes one ajax call, or another, and i'd like to return one deferred object that mirrors the ajax call I'm actually executing
[16:21:57] <shoky> hhuuggoo whacha mean?
[16:22:49] <slide263> if hhuuggoo doesn't respond could you maybe help me Shoky?
[16:24:05] <shoky> slide263: i don't know that library, sorry
[16:24:48] <slide263> :(
[16:24:51] <slide263> ty anyway
[16:28:47] <hhuuggoo> shoky, thanks, I think I'm revising my question a bit, still thinking about it
[16:29:50] <YammYcoding> guys, i want the dropdown .size to do stuff on change. How to make it work? http://yammy.com.br/phonegap/helloworld/
[16:37:32] <YammYcoding> so silence suddently...
[16:37:56] <YammYcoding> o feel like a queen who have spoke and everyone else shuts :)
[16:38:52] <benlieb> is there a way to do file size validation BEFORE upload?
[16:41:23] <YammYcoding> any bright mind awake? I need some help for a click event :)
[16:41:47] <Sna4x8> YammYcoding: Just bind .change to it.
[16:41:56] <YammYcoding> how?
[16:42:26] <YammYcoding> like it's an infinite amount of .size objects.
[16:42:34] <YammYcoding> i can't point to specific obj name in this case
[16:42:39] <hhuuggoo> shoky i got the answer, I want Deferred.pipe, since I'm using jquery 1.7.2 still
[16:42:39] <Sna4x8> http://jsfiddle.net/ZeVFU/
[16:44:04] <YammYcoding> don't work
[16:44:06] <YammYcoding> http://yammy.com.br/phonegap/helloworld/
[16:44:13] <YammYcoding> i tried several syntaxes
[16:44:14] <YammYcoding> :/
[16:45:03] <Sna4x8> Pasting a link to 100+ lines of poorly structured/commented out code is probably not the best way to get a response. Try making a fiddle of exactly what you need.  What I posted works just fine.
[16:45:49] <YammYcoding> it's the bigger dropwdown. i click nothing happen
[16:46:15] <madprops> appendTo is appending the div below the target div, instead of inside of it :/
[16:46:58] <shoky> prove it
[16:47:33] <YammYcoding> will document ready be ready after the ajax pull?
[16:48:05] <YammYcoding> (or push, i never kno)
[16:51:52] <shoky> YammYcoding: use event delegation e.g.  $('#main').on('change', '.size', function() { ... })
[16:51:58] <benlieb> why does $('#image_image') return an array?
[16:52:37] <shoky> benlieb: it returns a jquery object which is array-like, it's always a collection
[16:52:59] <benlieb> shoky: what is the standard way of accessing the first one? Just [0] ?
[16:53:48] <shoky> benlieb: that's the standard way of accessing the first element. if you want to keep it wrapped in a jquery object, it's .eq(0) or .first()
[16:53:50] <YammYcoding> oh shoky!! it worked!! but why this worked and the others like $('.size').change( function(e) {} didnt?
[16:54:13] <shoky> YammYcoding: because $('.size').change(  looks for the .size elements that are currently in the DOM
[16:54:30] <benlieb> shoky: ok. Shouldn't a #id always just be one on a page?
[16:54:51] <shoky> benlieb: yep
[16:54:53] <YammYcoding> and with this delegation thing what's the difference?
[16:55:27] <benlieb> shoky: strange that you'd always have to do .first() then. Seems like that should be the default behavior for # in css… Oh well.
[16:55:36] <shoky> YammYcoding:  $('#main').on  <-- looks for #main which is already in the DOM, so it works, and it sets the event handler on it. read about event delegation in the docs for .on()
[16:55:45] <benlieb> unless I'm missing something obvious.
[16:55:45] <shoky> benlieb: you don't have to do .first()
[16:55:54] <YammYcoding> ah i see.
[16:56:08] <shoky> benlieb: if it's just one element, you can just run stuff on it...  $('#elem').addClass('foo')
[16:56:32] <YammYcoding> also, it's with some intermitent behavior with the ajax load, sometimes it loads and sometimes it errors, o got to keep pressing F5 sometimes before the page load. What could it be>
[16:56:32] <YammYcoding> ?
[16:57:06] <YammYcoding> could it have to do with the timeout value?
[16:57:10] <shoky> duno what you're talking about
[16:57:34] <YammYcoding> if i open the page, the ajax errors, gotta keep refreshing until it loads.
[16:57:36] <benlieb> shoky: something is weird then. I'm trying to access the file size of a file field in HTML5, and I can't do it through query. Both $('#image_image').first().files and $('#image_image').eq(0).files return undefined
[16:57:53] <benlieb> However $('#image_image')[0].files works
[16:58:11] <YammYcoding> i need to prevent that error from happening. how can i print what the error acually is about?
[16:58:28] <shoky> benlieb: $('#image_image').prop('files') should work too, i think
[16:58:34] <benlieb> This also doesn't work $('#image_image').files[0].size
[16:58:51] <shoky> benlieb:  that's not jquery related tho
[16:59:19] <benlieb> shoky: yes, that works, but why isn't .files accessible on the object returned by jquery?
[17:00:29] <shoky> benlieb:  because jquery has a specific API and it doesn't include that, that's native functionality, for plugins to take care of
[17:00:58] <garbagegod> Question... if I include a JS file that creates one variable, how would I access that in a different JS file included... would I need to use window.var or extend a jquery object with it?
[17:01:28] <shoky> benlieb: .files is a property of file input elements, not of jquery objects
[17:01:50] <benlieb> shoky: ok. Why then does this work: $('#image_image').prop('files')[0].size but not  $('#image_image').prop('files').first().prop('size') or  $('#image_image').prop('files').prop('size') ?
[17:02:22] <benlieb> query is so confusing.
[17:02:27] <shoky> benlieb: .prop('files')  gives you the .files property, which isn't a jquery object. so you can't run .first() on it, or .prop() on it
[17:02:42] <shoky> .files  has nothing to do with jquery
[17:03:10] <shoky> .prop('files') is the jquery way of accessing that .files property
[17:03:31] <benlieb> shaky, I don't delve much into front end stuff. But I used to use prototype, which made so much more sense to me. :(
[17:03:51] <benlieb> shoky: tnx for your help!
[17:04:09] <shoky> eh .files has nothing to do with jquery or prototype
[17:04:45] <gf3> Yay Prototype
[17:04:50] <gf3> 4EVA
[17:04:54] <benlieb> shoky: bury prototype basically 'extended' all elements with new methods. I understand why that is bad, but it was so much cleaner for my limited use...
[17:05:38] <zissou> garbagegod, i think you are looking for this http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[17:06:37] <coldhead> i don't even know what SDN is
[17:13:01] <shoky> o well
[17:14:44] <traets> I use keypress() to detect a keypress. the first keypress is always 'undefined' as shown in console. why? http://jsfiddle.net/62FFF/
[17:15:02] <wer0ckz> Hi. Im using textillate() for text animation. How can i create a string variable to insert to my DIV?  - $('.myDIV').html("TESTING").textillate(); - how can i correct this?
[17:15:17] <psyferre> Hey, folks.  I've got a pair of functions that I need to run in order.  I've attempted to make one a callback function of the other, but execution is still willy nilly.  My second function always starts before the first finishes, so variables are left undefined.  Can anyone take a peek and give me a shove in the right direction?  All my googling has lead to techniques that didn't help or that I implemented incorrectly.  =-/

[17:17:48] <craigmr> traets try using .keyup
[17:18:20] <traets> craigmr: thanks. seems to have worked
[17:22:52] <devoldmx> hello
[17:23:45] <boytoy> devoldmx: hello
[17:24:35] <devoldmx> How many of you have jquery 2 in production?
[17:25:51] <coldhead> sometimes i have two different versions of jquery 1 in production
[17:25:54] <coldhead> so that's kind of the same
[17:27:28] <devoldmx> coldhead: do you have or do you have scheduled to use jquery 2?
[17:27:47] <YammYcoding> shoky, with that on change .size i reach the <select> on change, but i don't know which option has been clicked. How can i select that ?
[17:28:33] <YammYcoding> saying .size option doesn't work either.
[17:28:58] <garbagegod> No, I want one script to say var x = {}; and then access x from a different script
[17:28:58] <garbagegod> and by different script, I merely mean to separate <script src=...'s
[17:30:49] <craigmr> just create a global variable var x not in a closure/function/etc…or window.x does the same, I prefer window.x
[17:31:20] <garbagegod> that's kind of what I guessed
[17:31:28] <garbagegod> what's better about window.x exactly
[17:31:50] <craigmr> it's clearer that you are defining a global variable
[17:32:07] <garbagegod> cool
[17:32:10] <garbagegod> thank you much
[17:32:17] <craigmr> np
[17:32:38] <shoky> YammYcoding:  $(this).val()  will give the value of the selected option, and if you want the option text:  $(this).find('option:selected').text()
[17:32:57] <coldhead> devoldmx: i am probably gonna stick with 1.8 for the rest of my life
[17:33:02] <coldhead> unless there is a compelling reason
[17:33:10] <coldhead> i just love $.browser too much
[17:33:16] <YammYcoding> ah ok i'll try thanks :)
[17:35:19] <devoldmx> coldhead: Thank you
[17:36:21] <coldhead> quite welcome
[17:36:46] <YammYcoding> shoky i want this: $(this).find('option:selected').data('price'), but it's saying dom error blabla
[17:37:20] <YammYcoding> dom exception 12
[17:40:04] <boytoy> YammYcoding: phonegap rules
[17:40:43] <YammYcoding> ah okey
[17:40:55] <YammYcoding> i forgot the :selected js :/
[17:41:06] <boytoy> yet you got all these native java devs hating on it because they spent al their lives learning java and are too lazy to get familiar with normal web standards
[17:41:18] <YammYcoding> i know one :)
[17:41:35] <YammYcoding> like java rules, the rest sux
[17:41:41] <boytoy> * all
[17:41:46] <boytoy> lulz yeah
[17:42:07] <YammYcoding> and design is up to the designers (including all, css,html,js,jquery,php,mysql - all is 'design') to them..
[17:42:54] <boytoy> YammYcoding: they cant keep their sherade up for long :)
[17:43:08] <boytoy> phonegap apps are already taking over the top 20 charts
[17:43:49] <boytoy> whats your app though? looks like some just-eat.com stuff
[17:44:29] <boytoy> just-eat.com makes my sixpack fade lulz
[17:44:42] <devoldmx> a
[17:47:34] <YammYcoding> aham =D
[17:47:43] <YammYcoding> i'm trying to make a pizza order thing :)
[17:47:56] <stu7> I'm trying to find out why a $filterLinks.click(function() is not being called, and tested by copying the lines from jsfiddle.net/DA3wF/59 into a new html file and adding script calls for jquery(1.9.1) & isotope JS files, but it simply does not filter.  Any suggestions?
[17:48:17] <YammYcoding> it's my first mobile app, so i'm having such a hard time on learning several knowledge areas at once!
[17:48:33] <YammYcoding> it's quite damm hard but i'm liking it!
[17:49:16] <YammYcoding> shoky it was the missing module -selector. now it worked like a charm! thank you so much for help!
[17:49:43] <boytoy> yup me too
[17:50:09] <boytoy> you used to see boytoy sketching his ideas on a pentium 120
[17:50:25] <boytoy> all of a sudden smartphones? what? all of africa, asia, the middle east, not to mention youngsters in the West using it for everything A-Z
[17:50:53] <YammYcoding> hey pentium was the best cpu i ever had :D
[17:51:24] * boytoy laughs
[17:51:28] <boytoy> cool :D
[17:53:09] <stu7> I'm trying to find out why a $filterLinks.click(function() is not being called, and tested by copying the lines from jsfiddle.net/DA3wF/59 into a new html file and adding script calls for jquery(1.9.1) & isotope JS files, but it simply does not filter.  Any suggestions?
[17:55:01] <boytoy> YammYcoding: i used to work with roman nurik i'd love to give u some advice on your ui
[17:55:12] <boytoy> yo peep this https://plus.google.com/photos/+RomanNurik/albums/posts
[17:55:43] <YammYcoding> i'm using that chui ui thing.
[17:56:37] <stu7> hey guys, not sure if you see my texts
[17:56:37] <boytoy> sweet
[17:56:48] <boytoy> i dunno though, the zepto dude is *strange*
[17:57:01] <YammYcoding> who?
[17:57:28] <boytoy> your chui ui is based on zepto
[17:57:36] <YammYcoding> i duno it is?
[17:57:41] <boytoy> he did that scriptaculous thing, then when nobody wanted to use it, he got real bitter
[17:57:46] <YammYcoding> they work well together anyway
[17:57:53] <boytoy> made zepto and started hating on everybody
[17:58:05] <boytoy> you had all these jquery mobile devs switching over to zepto porting all their plugins
[17:58:12] <YammYcoding> but wasn't chui for the ui and zepto for..jquery?
[17:58:32] <gnarf> zepto now has more open bugs than jquery i think
[17:58:42] <boytoy> like pamela fox - here rapping at a developer convention: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHtGcZ9XqjY
[17:58:48] <boytoy> but he was like "meh, fuck off"
[17:58:51] <YammYcoding> i chose zepto to be smaller for slow mobiles
[17:59:00] <dougb> I'm using .on('click', function(e) {}); to capture click events, but if I return false, the link is still opening...is there a way to prevent it from opening unless it's returning true?
[17:59:12] <YammYcoding> but like, the zepto guy is not fixing the bugs ?
[17:59:40] <YammYcoding> if chui is based on zepto, how chui came first?
[17:59:58] <boytoy> YammYcoding: i dunno, i found it intriguing too at first but.. after hours and hours of research and interviews jquery mobile really came out the strongest
[18:00:18] <boytoy> they even have the adobe folks on their team
[18:00:24] <boytoy> the folks who made phonegap?
[18:00:29] <boytoy> i dunno but i think it's the way to go, really
[18:00:45] <boytoy> check out pamela fox though she really knows how to rap :D
[18:02:26] <YammYcoding> yes, but even jqm, people still say it's too heavy for slow mobiles
[18:02:36] <YammYcoding> with unused bloated code
[18:03:13] <boytoy> YammYcoding: yep was my concern too but now u can disable that
[18:03:26] <YammYcoding> like my app is taking some seconds to load already, i imagine that in slow mobile, with bigger js files to load, that may take an entire minute to load for the poor user
[18:03:32] <YammYcoding> ah you can?
[18:03:38] <boytoy> yup =)
[18:03:46] <boytoy> jquery mobile dudes finally listened
[18:04:09] <YammYcoding> hmm then maybe i will write all in zepto, and make a jqm version to compare afterwards.
[18:04:29] <boytoy> well respect
[18:04:31] <YammYcoding> #phonegap folks likely vote against jqm :)
[18:04:46] <boytoy> hehe i dunno
[18:04:48] <YammYcoding> they even recommend vanila js for you have an idea
[18:04:49] <boytoy> can u keep me updated though?
[18:04:55] <YammYcoding> aham sure
[18:05:04] <boytoy> ill buy u a meal from just-eat
[18:05:07] <boytoy> hehe
[18:05:19] <YammYcoding> hehe =)
[18:05:28] <YammYcoding> it's pizza hehe
[18:06:00] <YammYcoding> well now that the happy little select event is catched, i need to make the price update :)
[18:06:11] <coldhead> caught*
[18:06:22] <YammYcoding> ops hihi
[18:08:51] <netto> can someone suggest me a little jquery plugin to I study? I'm in a basic to intermediate level so I want to look more closely to some jascript codes to understand, can be github projects maybe
[18:14:54] <Memolition> hi is anibody there?
[18:15:03] <Memolition> *anybody*
[18:15:04] <coldhead> no one worth a damn
[18:15:30] <Memolition> so?
[18:16:40] <coldhead> netto: http://www.queness.com/post/112/a-really-simple-jquery-plugin-tutorial ?
[18:16:49] <coldhead> also http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/11/essential-jquery-plugin-patterns/
[18:17:05] <coldhead> but it's probably better to look at a plugin in you actually care about rather than generalities
[18:18:31] <netto> coldhead: thank you
[18:18:34] <stu7> I'm trying to find out why a $filterLinks.click(function() is not being called, and tested by copying the lines from jsfiddle.net/DA3wF/59 into a new html file and adding script calls for jquery(1.9.1) & isotope JS files, but it simply does not filter.  Any suggestions?
[18:21:14] <mercwithamouth> hi, could someone point me in the right direction. I want to detect the option that the user actually chooses and save the value to a variable
[18:21:22] <coldhead> i don't understand, stu7, this works fine for me http://jsfiddle.net/DA3wF/60/
[18:21:29] <coldhead> i see the colours changing per the filter links
[18:21:33] <coldhead> it does what i'd expect
[18:21:58] <coldhead> mercwithamouth: you got some HTML to link to? hard to tell what you mean in english
[18:22:16] <mercwithamouth> mercwithamouth: sorry about that.|3            4|4            5|5            6|6            7|7            8|8 9|9            0|10
[18:22:30] <coldhead> that is less helpful
[18:23:10] <mercwithamouth> ahh i see..sorry https://gist.github.com/anonymous/02f1407f601e29957747
[18:23:14] <stu7> coolhead: it does work in jsfiddle, but when I copy to a brand new html file of my own (*outside* of jsfiddle), it does not filter.  I guess I am missing something.
[18:23:26] <mercwithamouth> coldhead: sorry about that....irssi and I aren't getting along today.
[18:23:35] <coldhead> stu7: i would check the network tab of your debugger
[18:23:42] <coldhead> make sure it's finding the right files
[18:23:43] <coldhead> no 404s
[18:23:49] <coldhead> also check the console for errors
[18:24:07] <coldhead> and you can verify at the console that the fns are available
[18:24:12] <stu7> there are no 404s, there page does display, but the filtering functionality is what does not work.
[18:24:20] <coldhead> typeof $.fn.isotope should give something
[18:24:32] <stu7> let me try that
[18:24:38] <coldhead> are you maybe reloading jquery and so clobbering your plugins?
[18:26:15] <coldhead> mercwithamouth: http://jsfiddle.net/Z3jvp/
[18:29:17] <mercwithamouth> coldhead: ha! that easy huh...thank you. I'm new to js..and jquery for that matter. i've been kicking puppies all day trying to figure this out. ty
[18:30:45] <coldhead> mercwithamouth: http://try.jquery.com/ ?
[18:30:51] <coldhead> and http://jqfundamentals.com/
[18:34:36] <coldhead> so we're all good now?
[18:34:44] <coldhead> great work team, let's take a short break
[18:36:24] <mercwithamouth> coldhead: thank you. and yeah that gave me exactly what i needed
[18:37:41] <mercwithamouth> actually do you know of any good jquery/coffeescript tutorials? =P  at the moment i'm using eloquent js and converting things i learn to coffeescript afterwards
[18:38:42] <coldhead> the two i just linked
[18:38:56] <coldhead> i haven't seen any good jQuery in coffeescript tutes
[18:39:24] <traets> in a loop, i am storing <li>'s as object in a json, but when i try try to loop through the json again to do something like key.hide(), it seems to be treading key as a string instead of obj. is that normal?
[18:39:45] <mercwithamouth> good enough. i may have to make one myself over time. thanks, i'll take a look at the sites you gave
[18:40:14] <coldhead> are you sure you want an object for that, traets?
[18:40:20] <coldhead> not an array of objects?
[18:40:50] <traets> coldhead: yeah, because i store a string as the value
[18:41:03] <traets> { li.obj : 'something' }
[18:41:36] <coldhead> arr.push({ elem: li.obj, str: 'something'})
[18:41:48] <traets> will do
[18:41:57] <traets> but, now out of curiousity
[18:42:07] <traets> why do the objects become strings when i add them to the json?
[18:42:20] <coldhead> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6066846/keys-in-javascript-objects-can-only-be-strings
[18:42:29] <coldhead> it looks like you need to use strings/numbers for keys
[18:42:37] <coldhead> rather than objects
[18:42:48] <coldhead> so the objects are probably getting toString()ed to make your keys
[18:42:57] <traets> i see
[18:43:18] <traets> thank you

[19:00:03] <alanm123> Hello all.  Is this the right place to ask a noobie question?
[19:00:17] <coldhead> to gauge our days with gritty green in a faded blue jean
[19:00:24] <coldhead> go nuts, alanm123
[19:00:38] <alanm123> already have, but I'll ask anyway
[19:00:45] <coldhead> :D
[19:01:20] <alanm123> I was thinking the draggable ui api methods would give me the ability to prevent dragging from changing the cursor
[19:01:30] <alanm123> I have an unusual situation
[19:02:20] <alanm123> I'm using a mouse to move around on a simple grid: a table where I want to change the background color of the cell I click on or drag over.
[19:02:54] <alanm123> There's no text in the cells. It's just empty td cells.
[19:03:14] <alanm123> I'm playing around building a version of John Conway's Game of Life.
[19:04:18] <alanm123> Is there a simple way to prevent the cursor changing to an i-beam?  I'd like to disable dragging altogether. I know that's frowned upon, but in this case it makes sense.
[19:05:01] <alanm123> There's no text in the cells to highlight, and the highlight gets a bit in the way.
[19:06:10] <alanm123> Is there a jQuery function that would let me cancel the dragging?
[19:06:30] <coldhead> alanm123: http://api.jqueryui.com/disableSelection/ ?
[19:07:12] <stu7> coolhead: console did show 2 errors.  In the end there was only 1 cause: ME  <grin>  When I downloaded the jquery.isotope.js file,  I did not change the default HTML file type.  Thus, it was not recognizing *any* functions at all.
[19:07:20] <stu7> Thanks a lot for your help!
[19:07:30] <coldhead> oh man, glad you got it working
[19:07:36] <coldhead> you should get yourself a beer or something
[19:07:43] <stu7> hehehe  you bet!

Certain people want to get notified (via email) whenever there's a comment or a post (indicated by a boolean flag in the db). When/where (model, controller?) should I fire the loop that iterates over the users and sends an email to the proper ones?
[20:04:54] <ftj> Ope. Sorry, folks. Wrong channel.
[20:04:58] <coldhead> :)
[20:05:11] <coldhead> it's nice to see the kinds of things other channels are dealing with, don't sweat it

[20:53:00] <Cletus> Regarding jQuery UI, I'm curious if there is a way to download just a specific Interaction (Resizable) instead of all of core + the interaction.
[20:54:10] <Cletus> I am writing a userscript and the site uses some of jQuery UI, but not the Resizable interaction and I don't want to include core if it is already there. I am basically looking for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.resizable.js but minified with the latest version number.
[21:02:44] <Cletus> Is there anyone able to assist me on this?
[21:20:20] <djBuss> can anyone help me to understand why jquery validation plugin insists in validate when I click on a different button then the submit?
[21:23:28] <wer0ckz> help please - http://jsfiddle.net/KnQ5K/6/ - why its not stopping?
[21:24:19] <tw2113> did you read the plugin docs?
[21:27:45] <NaN> how can I get data using $(document).ajaxComplete() ?
[21:28:03] <NaN> sorry for the blank line
[21:28:09] <tw2113> wer0ckz, this looks like it may be a more uptodate plugin that does the same thing http://www.jquerynewsticker.com/
[21:29:18] <coldhead> you guys are still working out newsticker
[21:29:21] <coldhead> good times
[21:29:35] <tw2113> i went for documentation hunting
[21:29:41] <tw2113> the link in the fiddle is ancient
[21:31:53] <djBuss> hey guys, i'm validating a form with jquery validation plugin. The validation works ok, but it is validating the form if I hit any button. I would like it to validate only when the submit input is clicked
[21:33:24] <tw2113> what are you using in your selector?
[21:37:30] <djBuss> tw2113, the form selector?
[21:37:42] <tw2113> whatever you're using with your validator method
[21:37:51] <djBuss> $(form.add-contact).validate
[21:37:59] <djBuss> with the quots
[21:38:12] <tw2113> how many child dom elements have that class
[21:38:19] <tw2113> actually no
[21:38:27] <tw2113> that's targeting the form dom element itself
[21:38:32] <tw2113> and potentially everything inside it
[21:38:38] <tw2113> why not target just the submit button
[21:39:09] <djBuss> should I validate only the submit button?
[21:39:25] <tw2113> i figure the thought is to validate only when clicking the button
[21:39:46] <tw2113> unless this plugin has to manually validate each thing
[21:40:25] <tw2113> i would hope that clicking once would validate the whole form, and usually you want that on submit
[21:42:00] <djBuss> let me check
[21:42:10] <tw2113> what's the plugin site?
[21:43:29] <amh345> does anyone know what the regex  is to remove a forward slash and everything after said forward slash?
[21:43:48] <djBuss> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate#toptions
[21:47:35] <Cletus> Is anyone able to help on my prior issue: need to get https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.resizable.js just minified with correct version numbers. Need it as an automated solution as I don't want to do the minifying myself. Preferrably, I could reference this by url .../jquery.ui.resizable.min.js
[21:50:40] <djBuss> tw2113, if i select the submit button every button act as submit and they dont care about the plugin settingsubmits
[21:51:08] <tw2113> no idea then
[21:51:10] <tw2113> something's jacked up
[21:52:22] <djBuss> something strange about this
[21:52:36] <coldhead> damn straight
[21:54:57] <Gazpacho> amh345: any particular forward slash? first one, last one?
[21:55:32] <amh345> Gazpacho: i tihnk i figured it out.   it was for a string like this "aaaa/bbbbb"  i wanted it to be "aaaa"
[21:55:43] <amh345> it looks like /\/.*/ does it
[21:57:53] <j_wright> heh
[21:58:06] <djBuss> anyone familiar with the jquery validation plugin? any <button> is wrongly submitting the form
[21:59:00] <amh345> j_wright: heh < ;)
[22:31:31] <djBuss> Anyone here knows why a button inside a form inside a jquery-ui dialog submits the form??
[22:52:48] <coldhead> oh good, CONSTANT FUCKING CHAINSAWING, POWER SANDING AND LEAF BLOWING
[22:52:51] <louism2_> Hey all, I am trying to implement a shopping cart feature.  I am saving items as attributes on an object and then I want to convert that object data to a json array.  I can't get the object to convert to a json array.  Any ideas?  https://gist.github.com/louism2/5486814
[22:52:53] <coldhead> i have never felt more buddhist
[22:54:04] <coldhead> louism2_: var items = {} is more idiomatic
[22:54:19] <coldhead> and i would expect $.cookie('cart', JSON.stringify(items));
[22:54:19] <louism2_> coldhead: thanks, will change
[22:54:30] <louism2_> let me give that a shot
[22:54:34] <coldhead> and JSON.parse() when you're fetching it from the cookie
[22:54:45] <coldhead> cookies don't know about JSON
[22:54:51] <coldhead> and bitches don't know about my dignity
[22:56:40] <louism2_> coldhead: awesome, worked
[22:56:47] <coldhead> huzzah!
[22:56:53] <louism2_> coldhead: don't let the hater keep you down
[22:57:01] <coldhead> thanks babe
[22:57:15] <louism2_> coldhead: important to not live a hater-free lifestyle
[22:57:38] <louism2_> coldhead: the opposite of what I just said :)

[23:15:03] <Jakobud> does anyone know if you can return an XML Response?
[23:15:17] <coldhead> i don't see why not, Jakobud
[23:15:21] <coldhead> the X in AJAX is for XML
[23:15:32] <coldhead> also it represents Sexy Danger
[23:15:36] <Jakobud> well there isn't a Response::xml() method
[23:15:47] <coldhead> i gather we're not talking about jQuery then
[23:15:59] <coldhead> wrong channel?

[23:26:34] <ripthejacker> how can I hijack the browser's back button in jquery mobile?
[23:29:29] <ripthejacker> I want to prevent the default browser back button behaviour  and instead load a page that i want to specify
[23:29:51] <Nobita> ripthejacker: http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/ did you tried this?
[23:30:41] <coldhead> try*
[23:33:01] <ripthejacker> Nobita: But I need to do this on a mobile and mobiles have a hardware back button.
[23:35:20] <ripthejacker> I have a login page that validates the user and then let's him visit my site.
[23:36:00] <ripthejacker> Now after visiting the site, If he presses the back button he's again led to the login page, and I don't want this.
[23:37:10] <coldhead> ripthejacker: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12859759/take-control-of-hardware-back-button-jquery-mobile
[23:37:59] <coldhead> and so on
[23:39:33] <jonyee> using 1.3.1 JQM. When i open a dialog popup it flickers and the header and borders dissappear. Any idea why?
[23:40:36] <ripthejacker> coldhead: thanks , It's inelegant but I guess it's the only solution for now.
[23:40:37] <coldhead> does it do it on the JQM demo site?
[23:40:56] <coldhead> good luck ripthejacker
[23:51:21] <coderhut> Hi, I am new to google map api. I want to know that is there a javascript function to which we just give location name and it simply returns longitude and latitude information and nothing else
[23:56:54] <Cork> coderhut: that sounds like a #google question and not a jquery one
