[00:00:56] <Cork> zamba: you don't need id's for that
[00:00:59] <zamba> because now i also have to find the first td in the row to find the Ys.. but as i said.. this should be a date time.. so i guess it's not wise to set the id of those cells to id="2012-06-13 08:00:00" for instance? :)
[00:01:15] <Cork> $(this).index() and $(this).closest('tr').index() will give you that
[00:01:17] <zamba> <td id="2012-06-13 08:00:00">.. that's daft
[00:01:43] <zamba> so i need a way to specify the datetime object in the html so that javascript can grab that
[00:01:45] <Haprog> zamba: that's not a valid id
[00:01:48] <zamba> Haprog: exactly
[00:01:58] <Haprog> you need to use data-* attributes or something else
[00:02:09] <Cork> type
[00:02:17] <Cork> best is prob data-timezone="
[00:02:21] <Haprog> try <td data-date="2012-06-13 08:00:00">
[00:02:33] <Cork> $(this).closest('table').find('thead td').eq($(this).index()).data('timezone')
[00:02:35] <Haprog> Cork: why timezone? it seems to be just a datetime
[00:02:55] <Cork> Haprog: i'm guessing hes making a pick your timezone grid
[00:03:17] <Haprog> but timezones aren't specified as dates and times..
[00:03:27] <Cork> nether is date ;)
[00:03:28] <zamba> i'm not picking timezones, no :)
[00:03:29] <Cork> its datetime
[00:03:51] <Cork> anyway the name doesn't really matter
[00:03:59] <Cork> it should be data-<something> instead of id
[00:04:15] <Cork> and then you access it with data('<something>')
[00:05:09] <zamba> i'll try :)
[00:05:20] <zamba> jquery is fun
[00:05:45] <Cork> zamba: the data- prefix is html5 specification
[00:05:57] <Cork> (it works in none html5 complient browsers too though)
[00:10:42] <zamba> i did this, though: $(this).closest('tr').find('th').data('datetime');
[00:10:56] <zamba> because it's a th for that row
[00:10:56] <gf3> They need to wash they ass.
[00:11:06] <zamba> gf3: that's sweet
[00:11:18] <gf3> ?mlu
[00:11:19] <bot-t> much like urself
[00:11:40] <Cork> uh... ah, you mean like <th></th><td></td> ?
[00:14:06] <zamba> Cork: yeah <tr><th>Date</th><td>Something</td><td>Something else</td></tr>
[00:14:16] * Cork nods
[00:14:25] <Cork> might be cleaner to set it on the tr though
[00:14:35] <Cork> the data- that is
[00:14:36] <zamba> true
[00:14:42] <zamba> can omit the .find() then, right?
[00:14:46] <Cork> yes
[00:14:50] <zamba> that is cleaner
[00:14:57] <Cork> and much cheaper
[00:15:18] <Cork> closest just walks the parentNode chain
[00:15:34] <Cork> find has to do a full search on the dom tree from the specified parent
[00:15:42] <zamba> yeah
[00:16:07] <zamba> can the same be done for the X coordinate, i wonder?
[00:16:15] <zamba> so i don't have to do .find()
[00:16:21] <Cork> not really
[00:16:37] <Cork> you could save a reference to the thead
[00:16:44] <Cork> and save that lookup
[00:17:01] <Cork> but the eq($(this).index()).data has to happen
[00:17:48] <Cork> var headers = $('tabel thead td'); ........  headers.eq($(this).index()).data
[00:22:01] <tga> in jqmobile is it possible to delay the framework's initialization until a later point?
[00:22:18] <tga> I want to load some pages dynamically and then let the library work its magic
[00:30:34] <ravenzz> ?getScript @ tga
[00:30:34] <bot-t> tga, jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[00:30:50] <ravenzz> you can load jquery mobile after a while
[00:30:56] <ravenzz> i guess
[00:30:59] <tga> hmm, that's an interesting approach
[00:31:19] <ravenzz> or just trigger a custom event
[00:31:34] <ravenzz> and load the library
[00:31:50] <tga> yeah, I guess that would work
[00:32:02] <tga> speaking of jqm, one thing I was wondering
[00:32:22] <tga> when loading a page through xhr, jqm only grabs the first page div
[00:32:44] <tga> if you retrieve a page with $.ajax() can you use jquery to find certain elements in it?
[00:32:53] <tga> or do you append it to a hidden div first?
[00:33:12] <ravenzz> I didn't use jqm before
[00:33:23] <ravenzz> anyway yep
[00:33:27] <ravenzz> you can
[00:33:45] <tga> you can use jquery on a raw html string?
[00:33:55] <tga> or do you need to insert it into dom first
[00:35:20] <MrTool> can anyone tell me wich callback function get called after an ajax HEAD request failes cause an 404 (Not found), my problem is i want check if an image exists and in case of error load it from remote server. I got same Problem with JSONP Requests but i set CrossDomain on false and async on false
[00:35:39] <ravenzz> tga no you don't need to append to the dom, http://jsfiddle.net/43avZ/
[00:36:16] <tga> ravenzz: sweet, thanks
[00:36:53] <ravenzz> yw
[00:38:17] <Zhy> Quick question: Do checkboxes need to be inside form tags for them to have their state programmatically changed? $('checkboxselector').checked= true
[00:38:19] * tga is considering dropping jqm
[00:38:45] <ravenzz> you could
[00:39:09] <ravenzz> i don't know the library that much
[00:39:41] <tga> it has some nice UI elements, it's the framework parts that are giving me headaches
[00:39:43] <ravenzz> but the big advantage of using it is because you can handle touch events better and stuffs like that
[00:39:54] <tga> like the routing -- the first page change gets ignored, after that things work
[00:40:05] <tga> the hash changes, but the page doesn't
[00:40:14] <ravenzz> but if you need just for templating purposes. you can success without it as well
[00:40:31] <tga> yeah, I like the roadmap UI elements, it will get really interesting
[00:40:45] <tga> right now it's like jq UI, rather basic
[00:42:09] <ravenzz> dunno, I prefer to write my own markup/css
[00:42:57] <ravenzz> it is lighty, I have only what i really need, not a load of classes and stuffs
[00:43:10] <tga> on mobile you're a bit more constrained so you can use some generic patterns
[00:43:52] <tga> this routing issue is really annoying though, my best guess is a lifecycle problem
[00:44:04] <tga> I change the page too early in the initialization process or something
[00:46:01] <noderjs> hello. is there a timeout setting for the getScript() function?
[00:46:22] <noderjs> i want to write something where a getScript() to a server doesnt work out, I can go to plan B
[00:46:30] <noderjs> but dont necessarily want it to block for a long time
[00:49:22] <Whirl3d> so how do i use .on to monitor an object when it calls one of it's methods?
[00:49:40] <Cork> Whirl3d: you don't
[00:49:45] <Whirl3d> great.
[00:49:55] <noderjs> can anyone see my message?
[00:50:07] <Whirl3d> Now I wish I had stuck with my pubsub system. LOL
[00:50:14] <tga> Whirl3d: you can rename the method and the replace it with one that fires an event
[00:50:27] <tga> Whirl3d: what are you trying to do anyway
[00:50:32] <Cork> Whirl3d: var obj = { }; obj.met = function() { $(obj).trigger('met-called'); };
[00:50:48] <Cork> Whirl3d: var obj = { }; obj.met = function() { $(obj).trigger('met-called'); }; $(obj).on('met-called', function() {});
[00:51:15] <tga> you forgot to rename the existing method
[00:51:23] <Cork> no
[00:51:26] <Xotix> if i have a content editable div with a fixed width and paste a very long word into it, how can i make sure it just breaks the word and doesn't change the width of the div?
[00:51:35] <Whirl3d> I am trying to setup a simple system where I can have various items listen to the custom events fired by a gallery object...so when it says "showItem" all the item-dependent objects get updated.
[00:51:57] <Cork> Whirl3d: thats what trigger does
[00:52:08] <Cork> Whirl3d: it has nothing to do with the function names though
[00:52:25] <Cork> the event is triggered when you call trigger, nothing else
[00:52:50] <noderjs> Cork: can you see this message? i'm worried that there is some type of messaging rule i need to fulfill in order to publicly post in this room.
[00:52:52] <ravenzz> he is probably looking for a way to do that without triggering on each func
[00:53:13] <Cork> ya, and thats why i said you don't
[00:53:14] <ravenzz> something like an observer
[00:53:19] <Whirl3d> so then you need to bind the custom events back to the object that is firing them in order to trigger them?
[00:53:45] <Cork> Whirl3d: yes
[00:53:58] <Cork> or the element it affects (thats the most common)
[00:54:16] <Whirl3d> I was going to make my "gallery" object "announce" it's events--then the announce method would lookup subscribers registered for those events and fire the registered eventhalder in the scope of the subscriber
[00:54:41] <Cork> Whirl3d: alternativly you could fire global events
[00:55:37] <Cork> $.event.trigger('gallery-has-been-updated')
[00:55:59] <Cork> if you bind on('gallery-has-been-updated') on any element in the page, they will get the event
[00:56:18] <Whirl3d> and pass the gallery triggering the event in the global context
[00:56:31] <Cork> not really
[00:56:45] <Whirl3d> $.event.trigger('gallery-has-been-updated',this) --this being the gallery
[00:56:48] <Cork> $('table').on('gallery-has-been-updated')
[00:57:16] <Cork> the first arg needs to be a event object
[00:57:32] <Cork> hmm no wait
[00:57:41] <Cork> it needs to be an array though
[00:57:48] <Whirl3d> so my subscribers would do   bgPanel.on("gallery-has-been-updated", function (gallery) {
[00:57:56] <Cork> yes
[00:58:07] <Cork> $.event.trigger('event', [this])
[00:58:15] <Cork> the array is important
[00:58:22] <Whirl3d> cool. Why is that?
[00:58:29] <Cork> cause its the arguments
[00:58:52] <Cork> [first,second,third] is function(first,second,third)
[00:59:23] <Cork> if you send anything else it will try to mapp it to that anyway
[00:59:29] <Whirl3d> and it gums up if you just pass one object...
[00:59:34] <Cork> yes
[00:59:39] <Whirl3d> good to know
[00:59:43] <Cork> then it till try to handle the object as an array
[00:59:46] <Xotix> Cork could he do function() {this} instead of []?
[00:59:55] <noderjs> is there a timeout for getScript()?
[01:00:08] <Whirl3d> so, in order to trigger the event, I need to bind the event to the gallery? or the global scope doesn't require that?
[01:00:11] <Cork> noderjs: normal http timeout
[01:00:50] <Cork> Whirl3d: it needs to either trigger on all bound event listners ($.event.trigger) or on an object $(obj).trigger
[01:00:59] <Cork> of obj is a dom element or not doens't matter
[01:01:29] <Whirl3d> lemme update my mess and I'll see if this sinks in. Thanks, as always for the sage advice.
[01:01:41] <Cork> Xotix: don't think you can specify the scope for the event no
[01:04:55] <Cork> uh sorry got an error in there [first,second,third] becomes function(event, first, second, third)
[01:06:24] <Cork> Xotix: this is completely untested but it actually looks like you might be able to pass the scope as the third argument
[01:06:45] <Cork> $.event.trigger('event', [data], this)
[01:07:25] <Xotix> Cork hmm should wokr probably, but anyway was just for interest. :) thanks
[01:07:29] <stenno|work> good day, a friend of mine is using jquery-ui tabs ... can you somehow set that active tab on the server side? we tried to just set the tab classes to "ui-tabs-selected ui-state-active" on the server side but it didn't work ^^"
[01:10:00] <Whirl3d> so, my generic object that I need to handle the global event "showItem"....I bind it to the event by doing:   $.event.on("showItem", function (e, gallery, slide) { if (gallery==this.gallery) { do stuff   ?
[01:14:40] <Whirl3d> well, .bind nor .on seem to get the event to the object...your standard object has no method. And that's when I call $.bind() or $.event.bind( or $.on or $.event.on   ...
[01:17:32] <retro|cz> hello
[01:17:44] <retro|cz> I have problem with mocking keyup.
[01:17:55] <retro|cz> I just call - $('#capycorder input').trigger($.Event('keypress', {'which': 13}));
[01:18:00] <retro|cz> and nothing happened
[01:18:21] <retro|cz> when I press enter manually in that input, event is called
[01:18:41] <ENQ_> does $.extend merges object witch is inside object properities?
[01:19:10] <retro|cz> I just call - $('#capycorder input').trigger($.Event('keyup', {'which': 13}));
[01:19:12] <Xotix> retro|cz:  you can make $(i….input).keypress(function(e) { if e.which == 13})
[01:19:28] <Whirl3d> ENQ_ try $.extend(true, obja, objb);
[01:19:33] <Xotix> retro|cz: i ur way u probably have to use function() {} in trigger() i guess
[01:19:42] <Whirl3d> true turns on deep copy
[01:19:44] <ENQ_> Whirl3d, i will :)
[01:19:50] <retro|cz> Xotix, i try
[01:20:37] <retro|cz> Xotix, you mean $('#capycorder input').trigger(function() {$.Event('keypress', {'which': 13})}); ?
[01:21:13] <Xotix> retro|cz:  yes try it.
[01:21:27] <retro|cz> Xotix, TypeError: Object function () {$.Event('keyup', {'which': 13})} has no method 'indexOf'
[01:22:21] <retro|cz> Xotix, http://jsfiddle.net/3xTM2/
[01:22:25] <retro|cz> this works
[01:22:54] <retro|cz> but not in my script
[01:23:11] <TylerWhitney> is it possible to bind to events in an iframe on the same domain?
[01:24:29] <Xotix> retro  sry my fault. i would do it like that: http://jsfiddle.net/3xTM2/153/
[01:24:55] <retro|cz> Xotix, i have that
[01:25:01] <retro|cz> Xotix, now i need to test it
[01:25:10] <retro|cz> Xotix, so i need to call that event from code
[01:26:13] <Xotix> ah now it makes sense.
[01:31:21] <woozly> guys, how to get access from iframe to parents DOM?
[01:31:33] <woozly> Ive got permission denied
[01:31:46] <woozly> I have two domains, and from second domain I load iframe
[01:32:12] <woozly> host and domains - mine, what to do? I need to access from iframe's script to parent's dom
[01:32:13] <nebmo88> hi, please can someone tell me why line 6 (push) does not work: http://jsfiddle.net/626B2/181/
[01:33:46] <Whirl3d> Still not able to get the global event trigger thing to work. http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Z9xdc/8/
[01:33:58] <Whirl3d> ^ real simple focusField event
[01:39:50] <Whirl3d> capital E on $.Event...makes a big difference...still not there, but getting closer
[01:40:28] <Cork> uh $.Event and $.event isn't the same thing
[01:40:39] <Cork> $.event is the object for events
[01:40:48] <Cork> $.Event is a class create event objects
[01:40:48] <Whirl3d> Well, it didn't do anything.
[01:40:57] <Whirl3d> but $.Event at least threw an error. LOL
[01:41:00] <Cork> what version of jquery are you using?
[01:41:09] <Whirl3d> 1.7.1
[01:41:28] <Cork> one sec let me build a jsfiddle
[01:41:44] <Whirl3d> look at mine real quick, please. I'm sure it's something really simple.
[01:41:51] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Z9xdc/11/
[01:42:17] <Cork> uh...  $.bind("focusFied" ??
[01:42:44] <Whirl3d> tried a bunch of different ways.
[01:42:49] <Whirl3d> $.on, $.event.on
[01:43:09] <Whirl3d> as you can imagine, this was my last attempt (and the most desparate). LOL
[01:43:48] <Whirl3d> omg, if its all because of a typo I'm gonna cry
[01:46:01] <Cork> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/3HjhL/
[01:46:34] <Cork> Whirl3d: $.on $.event.on won't work
[01:46:38] <ENQ_> $.each(true, obj1, obj2) doesnt deep copy objects
[01:46:54] <Cork> uh... no
[01:46:58] <Cork> each doesn't copy anything

[01:47:55] <ENQ_> i have array inside object, and need to merge em

[01:49:07] <Cork> extend(true, { arr:[1], } { arr:[2], }) => {arr:[2]}
[01:49:29] <Whirl3d> Cork, your example binds to a jquery object, not a generic object...I've been trying to trigger events from generic objects with listeners that are generic objects.
[01:49:34] <ENQ_> what if i have array of objects? instead of array of arrays
[01:49:54] <jaffipaffi> Can I get help with jquery mobile here? No one's in the mobile channel :)
[01:50:01] <Cork> Whirl3d: you can't generically bind a listner
[01:50:23] <Cork> it needs to be on an object of some sort
[01:50:33] <ENQ_> i see
[01:51:00] <Cork> ENQ_: if you run extend on each object they will extend the first one
[01:51:19] <Cork> ex. $.extend.apply($, arr)
[01:52:33] <loostro> hi, i've got a problem with jquery draggable
[01:52:54] <loostro> i have a table (jquery DataTables) and it's TR are draggable
[01:53:04] <loostro> ive got another container which is droppable
[01:53:14] <Whirl3d> so, cork, how do I trigger "customEvent" on myObject?
[01:53:17] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/3HjhL/1/
[01:53:55] <loostro> dragging & dropping for the first time works no problem, but when i click "remove" (to remove item from the cart, and it goes back to the table)
[01:54:26] <loostro> then for the 2nd time the newly created TR refuses to work and be draggable
[01:55:21] <Cork> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/3HjhL/2/
[01:55:40] <loostro> Table is jQuery.dataTables so Im creating the TR with fnAddData() function  (and the .draggable is in fnRowCallback which is executed every time a row is being inserted/updated )
[01:55:43] <stenno|work> is it correct that: $(document).ready(mycallback); actually _appends_ the callback to the ready event handler?
[01:56:06] <Whirl3d> I didn't now you could wrap jquery around a generic object. that rocks. Thanks so much. That clears it all up.
[01:56:32] <Cork> Whirl3d: thats what i've been saying this entire time :)
[01:56:57] <Whirl3d> don't know why you didn't just come on out with $(obj) in the first place. LOL (just kidding)
[01:57:05] <Cork> stenno|work: what do you mean?
[01:57:12] <Cork> Whirl3d: i did
[01:57:26] <Cork> "<Cork> Whirl3d: it needs to either trigger on all bound event listners ($.event.trigger) or on an object $(obj).trigger"
[01:57:56] <stenno|work> Cork, i mean, i can do several $(document).ready(callback) 's on the page, and every callback gets considered
[01:58:11] <Cork> stenno|work: its event listners, so ya
[01:58:21] <stenno|work> ok thanks
[01:58:30] <Cork> you can bind several clicks to an element too
[01:58:40] <stenno|work> right
[02:01:45] <phr> hello guys, i'm having a problem
[02:01:54] <Whirl3d> Cork, I know you must be getting frustrated with my ignorance, but I have just about got it figured out.  All I need to now is how to use $.event.trigger("customEvent")....to trigger all bound listeners ..if one of the bound listeners is a generic object... that's the part that is not clear
[02:02:35] <Cork> Whirl3d: $.event.trigger will trigger all event listners jquery know about
[02:02:46] <nebmo88> hi, please can someone tell me why line 6 (push) does not work: http://jsfiddle.net/626B2/181/
[02:02:49] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/3HjhL/3/
[02:02:53] <phr> http://pastebin.com/FtFYuJYe here's my code. i'd like to add a line that would post my values from radio buttons. any help is appreciated:)
[02:04:16] <phr> how can i add and post values from radio buttons when submitting?
[02:04:54] <Cork> Whirl3d: not sure why that doesn't work
[02:05:10] <Cork> Whirl3d: might be the combination of events on an object and global events; never tried that combo
[02:05:36] <Whirl3d> pfew...maybe I am not dain bramaged after all... well....
[02:05:44] <phr> ;)
[02:06:15] <Cork> phr: if you have a form, the simplest solution is to use serialize see ?.serialize
[02:06:15] <bot-t> phr, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[02:07:28] <phr> Cork thanks dude, i'll take a look at that. i think it's only a line or so to add. all other input fields are processed correctly.
[02:08:02] <phr> wow, serialize is smooth!
[02:08:10] <phr> that's what i needed, i guess ;)
[02:08:23] <Cork> phr: your only processing one input field :)
[02:09:20] <phr> Cork true. i got one input field for search and 5 radio button to define the search category. in the php file i get the post results and use the right sql statement defined by radios :)
[02:17:30] <granden> Anyone know of a jquery plugin like slicebox but that can handle elements like divs and not only images?
[02:28:10] <boobyWomack> hi all Im trying to run an event after a google translate Select is changed
[02:28:31] <boobyWomack> so using (.gt select).change( fooo )
[02:28:56] <boobyWomack> but I actually need to know I think when the translate has finished - any ideas how I might "Watch" for that?
[02:29:06] <boobyWomack> "listen" for that event?
[02:43:41] <coder2>  how i scale two inline buttons to fill the entire screen? in jquerymobile
[02:54:10] <letweet> http://pastebin.com/JCZy0KKT         <<< This is generated code with an error in it. Can anyone suggest how I can fix?
[02:55:00] <stenno|work> $get does not work
[02:55:58] <letweet> stenno|work, I'll be honest, I have no idea where that code comes from... it was my boss who put this page together lol
[02:56:07] <stenno|work> seems like it
[02:56:22] <stenno|work> anyway, it helps when you actually say what error you get
[02:56:37] <ENQ_> there is no jquery letweet
[02:56:44] <stenno|work> my guess is something like: "ReferenceError: $get is not defined
[02:56:44] <stenno|work> [Bei diesem Fehler anhalten] 	
[02:56:44] <stenno|work> $get"
[02:56:56] <stenno|work> ooh
[02:56:59] <stenno|work> stupid me i should read
[02:57:04] <stenno|work> yeah you need to include jquery
[02:57:12] <stenno|work> after that, you need to fix the $get :)
[02:57:37] <stenno|work> $ is an alias for jQuery
[02:58:06] <letweet>     <script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.js"></script>
[02:58:06] <letweet>     <script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.lightbox-0.5.js"></script>
[02:58:10] <letweet> higher up in the page
[02:58:20] <stenno|work> well
[02:58:29] <letweet> the problem is that the lightbox tries to load up but can't ever seem to get an image
[02:58:33] <stenno|work> then jquery doesn't seem to be in ../js/jquery.js
[02:58:39] <letweet> it is
[02:58:41] <stenno|work> jquery is not loaded correctly
[02:58:42] <stenno|work> no
[02:58:52] <letweet> OMF
[02:58:54] <stenno|work> otherwise you woudn't get "$ is not defined"
[02:59:01] <letweet> the correct path is js/jquery.js
[02:59:04] <letweet> no ../
[02:59:08] <stenno|work> !
[02:59:18] <stenno|work> so, the next error will be "$get is not defined"
[02:59:32] <stenno|work> hmm letweet where do i know you from
[02:59:39] <letweet> Derpety derp de herr durr
[02:59:40] <stenno|work> ah i know!
[02:59:45] <letweet> stenno|work, #asp.net
[02:59:51] <stenno|work> yeah
[03:02:24] <phr> Cork i'm having issues with serialize().. can you help me out?:)
[03:03:07] <Cork> phr: whats the prob?
[03:04:37] <phr> well, if you look at my snipper at http://pastebin.com/FtFYuJYe .. at the bottom line, where the load() beginns, i'd like to add the radiobuttons as post too
[03:05:41] <phr> i'm pretty new to jquery, but i got the idea. it's just that i cant figure out how to add the selected radio to post data to my php
[03:06:42] <sacho_> $(radiobuttonselector).serialize()
[03:07:12] <phr> where/how should i add that syntax?
[03:07:22] <phr> if you take a look at the snipper
[03:07:32] <sacho_> that depends
[03:07:42] <sacho_> do your radio buttons have names
[03:07:48] <sacho_> are they what your server side code expects
[03:07:49] <sacho_> if so
[03:07:59] <sacho_> just add it to the current string
[03:08:00] <phr> they do have names, called search
[03:08:19] <phr> on the php i got request..
[03:08:38] <phr> you mean to $("#content #sub_cont").load("search.php?val=" + $("#search").val(), hideLoader()); or after it? :)
[03:14:12] <letweet> stenno|work, http://portfolio.netgendns.co.za ... clicking on either of those thumbnails will show you what's wrong with my page
[03:14:26] <letweet> the lightbox jquery tries to load, but the image doesn't display
[03:14:45] <stenno|work> hmm sorry i have no idea about lightbox
[03:16:39] <rosieres> Hi, I have some <article> elements and put their original height() into an array. But how do I verify on hover that the hover ist on which element to set the right height for an animation ?? http://jsfiddle.net/DAgDY/
[03:17:09] <stygyan> i'm stuck. i'm completely stuck.
[03:17:19] <letweet> Cork, I believe you pointed my problem out the other day... no href on my <a> tag
[03:17:26] <stygyan> anyone could help me to develop a quick effect for jquerytools validator?
[03:18:03] <letweet> at the time, when I added the href, it just redirected to the image because jquery was incorrectly referenced... now I've fixed the jquery reference and added the href, it work 100%
[03:18:19] <stygyan> http://jsfiddle.net/YV9LY/
[03:18:31] <stygyan> I just want to add a class to the input that generated the error
[03:20:40] <letweet> stygyan, does that input have a name attribute? (stupid question, I know, but gotta start somewhere)
[03:20:48] <stygyan> yeah.
[03:21:02] <stygyan> that's the original effect, brought from the custom error page
[03:21:21] <stygyan> we've got phone, mail, name, and a couple more
[03:21:21] <letweet> can you provide a bit of example html for that input?
[03:21:45] <stygyan> updated
[03:22:44] <stygyan> you can look in the same jsfiddle, letweet  :)
[03:22:45] <stygyan> thank you
[03:33:00] <Xib> Hi all just a small question on sortable how can i update each input with the new index : http://jsfiddle.net/sLLtp/2/
[03:33:17] <Xib> with the new position index
[03:42:00] <rosieres> ok found out that index is my friend... done ;-)
[03:48:53] <Vooloo> the modal diablog that pops up has a fixed design when you use the themeroller to change colors. but is it possible to change for example the header bar (which is colored) to fill out the entire top without having like 5px between edge and header? is all you need to edit the CSS?
[03:49:04] <rags> Hi, trying to use bootstrap-typehead.js gives me this error : $("#search").typeahead is not a function : what does this mean?
[03:49:04] <rags>  The .js file is included
[03:53:31] <Xotix> my click gets triggered althought i have event.preventDefault(); why? actually it is a submit.
[04:23:54] <Whirl3d> submit is a different event than click
[04:25:20] <Flo0815> is anyone good with .htaccess-files?
[04:26:29] <Cork> noones good with .htaccess files :)
[04:26:35] <Flo0815> :)
[04:26:55] <Flo0815> ok, does somone know sth about AddHandler and running as CGI?
[04:27:48] <Cork> what about it?
[04:28:11] <Flo0815> if have this: AddHandler php52-cgi .phpx
[04:28:29] <Flo0815> i just wnt to know if it concernes only files with .phpx
[04:28:45] <Flo0815> or does it take all php files?
[04:29:00] <Cork> the second argument is the extension to handle
[04:29:12] <Flo0815> so only .phpx-files
[04:29:20] <Cork> ?g host:appache.org AddHandler
[04:29:22] <bot-t> Cork, mod_mime - Apache - The Apache Software Foundation! - http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_mime.html
[04:29:39] <Cork> opps, well it worked :)
[04:29:43] <Flo0815> :)
[04:30:01] <Cork> "Files having the name extension will be served by the specified handler-name."
[04:30:11] <Flo0815> yep
[04:30:12] <Flo0815> ok
[04:30:13] <Flo0815> thx
[04:30:19] <Flo0815> then i have to search the error :)
[04:30:49] <Afflicto> using $(".column").each(function(index){});  how can I select children of the current iterated object?
[04:31:58] <sacho> $(this).children()
[04:32:04] <sacho> $(this).find()
[04:32:54] <Afflicto> I'm looking for ".columnheader" though..
[04:33:05] <Afflicto> Can I do $(this).children(".columnheader"); ?
[04:33:19] <Cork> $(".column").each(function(index){ $(this).find('columnheader') });
[04:33:21] <sacho> yes
[04:33:33] <Cork> opps missed the dot
[04:33:33] <sacho> in the future, look at the jquery api before asking questions about it
[04:33:37] <sacho> the docs are good enough
[04:33:44] <Afflicto> k thanks
[04:34:04] <Cork> Afflicto: children only looks at direct children though, so most of the time you want find
[04:34:22] <Afflicto> I want direct children this time hehe :P
[04:38:35] <logiclord> Hi all I am facing a problem while working with jquery http://pastebin.com/J2yY2F1y changes are not reflected in htmlCode string ??
[04:40:52] <Cork> logiclord: jquery modifies the dom generated from the string
[04:40:54] <Cork> never the string
[04:41:43] <Cork> var domCode = $(htmlCode); domCode.find()..... htmlCode = $('<div/>').append(domCode).html()
[04:43:07] <logiclord> Cork: so only wayout is to add html code in dom .. comdify it and save ?
[04:43:33] <Cork> logiclord: no, but don't expect it to be html when your done
[04:43:41] <Cork> if you parse html to dom, its dom
[04:43:52] <Cork> its not magically mapped to the html string
[04:44:04] <logiclord> got it thanks :)
[04:46:24] <fuchstronaut> when initializing my plugin i have to run functions on a big set of elements. as this naturally takes some time, on slow machines firefox might come up with the question to end the script. how do i prevent that?
[04:46:58] <fuchstronaut> is it enough to run that .each inside another each to split things up?
[04:47:21] <stenno|work> optimize the script :)
[04:47:30] <stenno|work> learn about complexity theory
[04:47:52] <fuchstronaut> thanks for your nonanswer...
[04:48:03] <stenno|work> this is the answer
[04:48:19] <fuchstronaut> cant optimize
[04:48:25] <fuchstronaut> this is not an option
[04:48:28] <stenno|work> you have not even posted any code, or did you?
[04:48:35] <fuchstronaut> no i did not
[04:48:58] <fuchstronaut> basicly im running user-defined js-functions on a big set of elements
[04:49:01] <fuchstronaut> so i dont know the code
[04:49:22] <stenno|work> but you know the code of the user-defined js function
[04:49:32] <fuchstronaut> no i dont
[04:49:41] <fuchstronaut> its kind of an jquery excell
[04:49:46] <stenno|work> ugh
[04:49:54] <stenno|work> hmm
[04:50:18] <fuchstronaut> im trying to optimize these functions automaticly, but you are limited
[04:50:30] <fuchstronaut> so i will have to try to split it somehow or something
[04:50:47] <fuchstronaut> so its not one big function taking all the time
[04:50:50] <fuchstronaut> so firefox wont complain
[04:51:07] <stenno|work> the question is if that really helps :)
[04:51:19] <fuchstronaut> yea thats my question ;-)
[04:51:19] <stenno|work> my guess would be no
[04:51:32] <stenno|work> as the overall time needed doesn't change
[04:51:42] <fuchstronaut> the time is okey
[04:51:49] <fuchstronaut> users can wait some seconds on init
[04:51:58] <fuchstronaut> i just dont want firefox to ask for quitting the script
[04:53:56] <stygyan> man
[04:54:02] <stygyan> and i keep on being stuck
[04:54:03] <stygyan> dammit
[04:56:15] <stygyan> back in five minutes
[05:02:20] <amcsi_work> hello
[05:02:36] <amcsi_work> how would you make a box slide in from an invisible line?
[05:03:14] <shoky> an invisible line?
[05:04:25] <amcsi_work> yes, so let's say there's a fixed line 100px from the bottom of the window, and I want a box to slide up, coming from the invisible line
[05:05:09] <amcsi_work> there would never be anything seen from the box from within 100px of the window's bottom, and it would be like the box is popping out of the invisible line
[05:05:13] <shoky> use css to position the box and animate it
[05:05:46] <amcsi_work> I know this is easy if the box needs to pop out from the bottom, because you can't see past the bottom anyway
[05:06:02] <amcsi_work> but in this case, it needs to pop out from a bit above the bottom
[05:06:08] <amcsi_work> do you understand?
[05:06:31] <shoky> ill try to fiddle you something
[05:06:44] <shoky> but would be best if you fiddle something for me to fiddle with..
[05:07:33] <amcsi_work> thank you, but I don't need anyone to make it for me. I can make it myself. I'm just having trouble making up the logic for something like this, and I would like some help with that.
[05:08:48] <shoky> yeah, the fiddle wouuld just show that logic, instead of trying to talk about it
[05:08:54] <amcsi_work> at first I thought of having a fixed box 100px from the bottom, covering 100% of the width and being allocated 400px for instance, and having it be overflow: hidden, and I could easily pop out the box from the bototm of that. The problem with that was that that huge allocated space actually covers all the content it is over on, blocking mouse events.
[05:08:58] <shoky> that is logical, yes
[05:09:13] <shoky> see, trying to talk about it is really yucky :)
[05:09:59] <amcsi_work> yea, I guess I could of used css to explain what I just described :P
[05:10:08] <shoky> ;p
[05:10:28] <shoky> i'm sure you're smart enough to extract the logic from anything i fiddle for you, yes?
[05:10:41] <amcsi_work> yea
[05:10:54] <shoky> groovy
[05:16:47] <shoky> heh
[05:17:37] <shoky> amcsi_work: how's this http://jsfiddle.net/PRhh5/1/
[05:17:46] <amcsi_work> I'm looking
[05:18:11] <amcsi_work> that's exactly what I want
[05:18:14] <shoky> ;D
[05:18:37] <amcsi_work> let me examine this
[05:18:37] <shoky> i want a kitty
[05:18:48] <stenno|work> who doesn't!
[05:18:54] <stenno|work> for lunch?
[05:19:00] <shoky> noooooooooooooooooooooooo
[05:19:15] <stenno|work> heh you don't eat kittens for lunch
[05:19:23] <stenno|work> its more something for breakfast
[05:19:35] <shoky> word
[05:19:35] <caniuse> shoky: bond
[05:19:58] <amcsi_work> :D
[05:20:17] <stenno|work> word
[05:20:17] <caniuse> stenno|work: bond
[05:20:24] <stenno|work> silly caniuse
[05:20:53] <amcsi_work> so jQuery has a very simple method that takes care of everything? I just have to allocate where the toast box should be and have it be display: none, and then just slide it up with jQuery?
[05:20:56] <shoky> btw amcsi_work that slideDown() would work the same if it was position:absolute  instead of position:fixed
[05:21:06] <shoky> amcsi_work: yep
[05:21:18] <amcsi_work> neat, thank you!
[05:21:25] <shoky> np
[05:22:29] <shoky> amcsi_work: but the key here is to fix the  bottom:100px
[05:22:56] <shoky> amcsi_work: if you try setting the top instead, it'll actually slideDown (and not up as it does now, confusingly)
[05:23:38] <amcsi_work> so slideDown slides up when jquery detects that bottom is set?
[05:26:11] <shoky> i dont think jquery is detecting it or doing anything different, but it just doesn't touch the fixed bottom, so a slideup effect is created, or something
[05:26:19] <shoky> i'll check
[05:27:11] <shoky> ok so slideDown is just a shortcut for a 'show' effect
[05:27:22] <amcsi_work> I wonder how it is done
[05:27:47] <shoky> let's see
[05:28:16] <amcsi_work> if only the height were animated, anything contained should stick out, if overflow is not set to hidden
[05:28:37] <shoky> nah if it was the height the image would start out squished
[05:28:40] <Whirl3d> how can I take text from an input element and turn it into something the console can log the value of....in other words, I would like to type $("something").css("opacity") into an input field and click a button to have the console log the opacity value of something...
[05:28:42] <shoky> thats why i put the image there ;p
[05:28:53] <amcsi_work> yea, and the image would be squished
[05:29:20] <amcsi_work> but you used a background, which doesn't squish
[05:29:29] <shoky> Whirl3d:  eval or an equivalent
[05:29:30] <nFFF> $(document).ready( is still firing before dom load
[05:29:34] <nFFF> any reasons why
[05:29:37] <nFFF> btw its in magento
[05:29:40] <NodeX> PHP rocks - true story
[05:29:49] <amcsi_work> ah well, we'll see. In the worst case, I should be able to fix everything with a covering overflow: hidden box
[05:30:30] <Haprog> PHP sucks, actually. :P It's usable but could be a lot better.
[05:30:55] <shoky> oh no, not again
[05:31:17] <NodeX> trolololol
[05:31:25] <Haprog> I'm not going to argue though
[05:31:28] <fuchstronaut> When accessing an element (tablecell, td), whats the fastest way to do it? I know the tables ID, the rows (tr) index and the cells (td) index, so I assume: $('#table_id > tbody').children('tr').eq(7).children('td').eq(1) is best i can get, right?
[05:31:39] <shoky> why even say that :\
[05:31:57] <Haprog> still I code in PHP almost every day
[05:31:57] <NodeX> visual basic rocks - true story
[05:32:17] <laszlof> turbo pascal > *
[05:32:19] <fuchstronaut> coming from perl php is really a pain sometimes ;-)
[05:32:26] <stenno|work> laszlof, ...
[05:32:26] <NodeX> Apple MacBook pro's suck - true story
[05:32:34] <laszlof> fuchstronaut: funny, i say the same thing about perl :P
[05:32:36] <fuchstronaut> but its available everywhere and thats big, same for java
[05:32:37] <shoky> laszlof++
[05:32:47] <stenno|work> laszlof, that was my firrst real programming language
[05:32:54] <stenno|work> if you don't call LOGO one
[05:32:55] <laszlof> stenno|work: same
[05:33:03] <Whirl3d> NodeX is a troll...lol
[05:33:04] <shoky> mine was basic
[05:33:11] <fuchstronaut> lets all agree on silverlight beeing the best thing in the world
[05:33:13] <NodeX> troll's rock - true story
[05:33:15] <fuchstronaut> right after adobe products
[05:33:27] <NodeX> people got so butthurt yesterday lol
[05:33:33] <stenno|work> i heard that MacBook pro now comes with retina display
[05:33:33] <laszlof> speaking of adobe
[05:33:42] <laszlof> has anyone messed with adobe edge?
[05:33:47] <Whirl3d> 3799 for the top of the line macbook pro
[05:33:55] <stenno|work> if someone wants to spend way too much money on a piece of hardware and software, fine
[05:34:02] <stenno|work> but i wont
[05:34:03] <fuchstronaut> well it looks great
[05:34:06] <stenno|work> yes
[05:34:11] <stenno|work> yes it looks great
[05:34:12] <stenno|work> yes
[05:34:12] <NodeX> they just dropped a load of stuff on it from what I read
[05:34:15] <pachet> i heard that the new macbook pros can double as an egg skillet
[05:34:15] <stenno|work> 3indeed
[05:34:17] <fuchstronaut> so for some its worth that
[05:34:21] <pachet> 'laptop' my ass
[05:34:29] <Whirl3d> 2200 is a good price for the fastest laptop with a display that is higher resolution than my 37" monitor
[05:34:38] <NodeX> they're very expensive
[05:34:45] <fuchstronaut> tbh, when i would have to buy a computer for my mum, or someone who doesnt really know anytihng, i would go for an apple product i think..
[05:34:55] <stenno|work> yes
[05:35:05] <NodeX> better off with a netbook + Chorme
[05:35:07] <NodeX> Chrome
[05:35:13] <fuchstronaut> but whenever you need something more you have to go with something else
[05:35:16] <stenno|work> if you expect from a user "he wont change the system and wont even try" then osx might be a good OS choice
[05:35:16] <Whirl3d> lol
[05:35:20] <NodeX> easier to use for someone who want's to just go online anyway
[05:35:35] <fuchstronaut> (NodeX): yeah chrome os is not a bad idea
[05:35:36] <stenno|work> if you expect a user "he wants to install his own software", then use linux or sthing
[05:35:48] <novochar> how do you display text in window.open?
[05:36:07] <fuchstronaut> When accessing an element (tablecell, td), whats the fastest way to do it? I know the tables ID, the rows (tr) index and the cells (td) index, so I assume: $('#table_id > tbody').children('tr').eq(7).children('td').eq(1) is best i can get, right?
[05:36:11] <NodeX> for ease of use - getting online anyway
[05:36:11] <Whirl3d> oh yeah, linux for my mom, good suggestion
[05:36:35] <stenno|work> Whirl3d, so your mother is a hacker?
[05:36:40] <Whirl3d> for getting online, nothing beats the ipad.
[05:36:41] <stenno|work> then linux indeed
[05:36:42] <fuchstronaut> shes trinity
[05:36:46] <NodeX> linux is fairly easy to use nowerdays - desktop anyway
[05:37:03] <Whirl3d> or ipaid, as it were
[05:37:10] <stenno|work> ipad, sure
[05:37:10] <rroelofs> Whirl3d: it is.  it's best in class for remote admin since you will have to maintain it anyway :-)
[05:37:12] <fuchstronaut> actually the ipad is the housewifes entrance to the web
[05:37:31] <stenno|work> if you don't want to actually access data on your device, ipad would be a solution
[05:37:58] <Whirl3d> I maintain pcs using my ipad. LOL I login with logmein and it's a breeze
[05:38:00] <NodeX> if you dont want it to be interoperable with anything other than APPLE products then ipad is a great choice
[05:38:09] <stenno|work> that too
[05:38:14] <stenno|work> oh the periphery!
[05:38:22] <stenno|work> what do we have? micro-firewire..??
[05:38:23] <fuchstronaut> actually if you dont want to be interoperable with anything
[05:38:31] <Whirl3d> I just got the new acer quad-core tablet and it is blazing
[05:38:43] <stenno|work> quad-core tablet? WTF?
[05:38:48] <Whirl3d> thunderbolt!
[05:38:49] <Whirl3d> ftw
[05:38:52] <NodeX> I asked my friend to bluetooth me a pic from his iphone the other day
[05:38:57] <fuchstronaut> haha
[05:38:58] <stenno|work> why would you need a fucking quad-core pad
[05:38:59] <NodeX> it's not possible he told me
[05:39:02] <NodeX> Nuff said!
[05:39:04] <stenno|work> NodeX, that is true
[05:39:30] <stenno|work> iphone bluetooth can only connect to other apple shit products
[05:39:38] <fuchstronaut> still, most users use mail, youtube and some simple html pages
[05:39:51] * stenno|work notes that youtube is a simple html page
[05:39:54] <fuchstronaut> so when you are willing to spend shitloads of money for that, the ipad is perfect
[05:40:02] <NodeX> I asked him where the flash was on the Iphone 3 I think
[05:40:06] <shoky> amcsi_work: it sets its padding-top and margin-top to 0, overflow:hidden, and animates its height
[05:40:15] <NodeX> he said "It aint got one - they're bringing it out on the next version"
[05:40:16] <shoky> amcsi_work:  http://jsfiddle.net/PRhh5/3/
[05:40:22] <NodeX> again .. for £400 nuff said
[05:40:23] <Whirl3d> flash sux anyways. It works great on my acer pad though.
[05:40:45] <fuchstronaut> flash sux, but still now and then you need it, so i dont understand apple about beeing so nazi about flash
[05:40:56] <stenno|work> no it just sucks
[05:40:59] <stenno|work> you don't need it
[05:41:00] <fuchstronaut> than again i dont understand apple most of the time :P
[05:41:01] <Whirl3d> I wish cintiq would come out with a reasonable screen...
[05:41:02] <stenno|work> it just sucks
[05:41:15] <NodeX> yer flash sucks
[05:41:16] <NodeX> lol
[05:41:25] <NodeX> 98% ubiquity .. it must suck
[05:41:29] <fuchstronaut> so if you get a cute kitten video link via mail
[05:41:37] <Whirl3d> it's not apple, it's Steve Jobs...he's just angry at adobe for taking so long to port cs native to mac
[05:41:39] <fuchstronaut> you cnat see the cute kittens with your ipad
[05:41:43] <NodeX> might be 95% but still
[05:41:51] <Vooloo> the modal diablog that pops up has a fixed design when you use the themeroller to change colors. but is it possible to change for example the header bar (which is colored) to fill out the entire top without having like 5px between edge and header? is all you need to edit the CSS?
[05:41:59] <stenno|work> fuchstronaut, if it is a flash video
[05:42:09] <fuchstronaut> of course it is
[05:42:27] <fuchstronaut> whenever you get a cute kitten video link its 50% chance its a flash video
[05:42:28] <fuchstronaut> !
[05:42:38] <stenno|work> yes i hope this rate will go down soon
[05:42:43] <Whirl3d> other 50% chance it's jquery and html5
[05:42:44] <fuchstronaut> it will
[05:42:45] <stenno|work> with the advent of html5 video anyway
[05:42:59] <fuchstronaut> 2 years ago your chance was 85%
[05:43:11] <stenno|work> there is no jquery video, Whirl3d
[05:43:19] <fuchstronaut> there is no point to implement flash on iOS devices now, but back than it was
[05:43:26] <stenno|work> true
[05:44:25] <fuchstronaut> anyway, android is so close in terms of usabilty, where apple did not improve, still great usability and sucky restrictions
[05:44:33] <fuchstronaut> so soon theyll run into problems
[05:44:35] <Whirl3d> right, I mean except jplayer, jquery Media, jqueryVideo player, and at least 20 other jquery plugins for video
[05:45:23] <Chepra_> Hi!
[05:45:31] <pachet> hi
[05:45:33] <Whirl3d> Chepra_ Hi
[05:45:35] <fuchstronaut> are there any downside for html5videos compared to flash? other than support by sucky browsers?
[05:45:44] <amcsi_work> shoky: that's neat, although I'm trying to figure out how your first one worked
[05:45:45] <Chepra_> Does anyone knows why IE8/9 do not animate the menu here? http://demagdev.imosnet.de/de/gruppen/25801.meissel-r-10-3-x-36-mm.html
[05:45:52] <amcsi_work> it slides down from upward for me
[05:45:57] <shoky> amcsi_work:  exactly the same..
[05:46:03] <pachet> fuchstronaut: same issue that comes up in other formats
[05:46:16] <shoky> amcsi_work: huh it looks exactly the same to me
[05:46:16] <pachet> fuchstronaut: some codecs are proprietary and require licenses
[05:46:37] <fuchstronaut> yeah well, this is the same with flash, no?
[05:46:49] <fuchstronaut> i dont know alot about videos
[05:46:51] <pachet> well, they foot the bill for a lot of them
[05:46:53] <shoky> amcsi_work: all i did was spell out what jquery was doing with slideDown
[05:46:56] <stenno|work> html5 does not support streaming yet
[05:47:01] <stenno|work> html5 video
[05:47:06] <pachet> whereas browsers, its kind of hit or miss what they'll shell out cash to support
[05:47:20] <stenno|work> note that the audio tag allows streaming with mozAudio interface extension
[05:48:05] <fuchstronaut> hm... streaming is big, with all the internte-tv-on-demand things coming up now, no?
[05:48:37] <shoky> oh
[05:49:01] <shoky> amcsi_work: weird that it looks the same to me, i forgot to remove the margintop/paddingtop only on animation completion
[05:49:07] <shoky> Derp
[05:49:28] <niels__> i'm trying to do an alert if a select box isn't selected. whats wrong with my code? :( http://jsfiddle.net/RUPny/
[05:49:57] <pachet> fuchstronaut: you can stream in html5
[05:50:04] <shoky> amcsi_work: how bout now? http://jsfiddle.net/PRhh5/4/
[05:50:05] <pachet> you just cant do adaptive streaming reliably
[05:50:14] <pachet> but it'll get there
[05:50:34] <fuchstronaut> im sure it will, as it has to replace flash :)
[05:50:50] <stenno|work> fuchstronaut, well check mozAudio interface for inspiraition
[05:50:59] <fuchstronaut> i will
[05:51:00] <stenno|work> i hope there will be the same thing for the video tag, too
[05:51:10] <NodeX> html6 rocks - true story
[05:51:18] <stenno|work> html6
[05:51:45] <niels__> yo dudes and dudettes.. what am i missing? i honestly can't figure it out. http://jsfiddle.net/RUPny/
[05:52:01] <stenno|work> you are missing a description of the actual problem
[05:52:02] <NodeX> coffee ?
[05:52:15] <sacho> "stuff is broken"
[05:52:26] <stenno|work> "it does not work" :)
[05:52:29] <NodeX> why do you select#id ...
[05:52:44] <stenno|work> but that is correct
[05:52:44] <shoky> amcsi_work: man its so simple, all it takes is height:0 and overflow:hidden
[05:52:46] <niels__> stenno|work: well ok, thought it was obvious the .val() clearly isnt == '' :)
[05:52:46] <NodeX> right to left will find an ID then check to see if it's a select
[05:53:24] <niels__> NodeX: im not quiet sure i follow you
[05:53:28] <stenno|work> well but that is not at all the problem
[05:53:30] <NodeX> #id is really fast because it resolves to native
[05:53:34] <ravenzz> ?submit @ niels__
[05:53:34] <caniuse> niels__: .submit(): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[05:53:36] <stenno|work> because it STILL WORKS
[05:53:44] <NodeX> it's not the problem no but it's not needed
[05:54:02] <sacho> niels__, your options don't have value attributes
[05:54:06] <ravenzz> niels__ also you can just check the select value
[05:54:17] <ravenzz> if it is empty or not
[05:54:27] <shoky> amcsi_work: http://jsfiddle.net/PRhh5/5/
[05:54:31] <niels__> ravenzz: i thought that was what i did
[05:54:33] <NodeX> when <option> is missing the attribute on some browsers it uses what's in the <option> tag as the value
[05:54:42] <sacho> niels__, http://jsfiddle.net/Xrtk8/2/
[05:54:44] <NodeX> you need to explicitly put value=""
[05:55:07] <niels__> oh, how cruel
[05:55:17] <ravenzz> niels__ you are checking aginst the selected option
[05:55:33] <stenno|work> ooh global notice
[05:55:36] <niels__> i see, thanks alot
[05:55:39] <stenno|work> ha
[05:55:56] <shoky> amcsi_work: hell, don't even need overflow:hidden
[05:55:56] <niels__> i need coffee.
[05:55:59] <Chepra_> cant anyone help me with the fadein/out problem with the link i posted above?
[05:56:18] <sacho> IE hates you and your animations
[05:59:28] <NodeX> jquery rocks - true story
[05:59:49] <stenno|work> jquery is really a nice project
[05:59:51] <Xotix> if i have something like $("img[src='']", this) how can i exclude the img's with a specific class?
[06:00:03] <stenno|work> :not :)
[06:00:05] <scotdb> Got a jQuery with IE issue ... tabs work perfectly on all other browsers.   But on IE I get the first tab contents (href is to PHP file) but all other tab contents are not displaying at all
[06:00:05] <stenno|work> :not
[06:00:18] <NodeX> or not
[06:00:20] <NodeX> not()
[06:00:23] <NodeX> same thing!
[06:00:25] <stenno|work> that is css3 pseudoselector
[06:00:28] <stenno|work> or not!
[06:00:29] <stenno|work> :D
[06:00:30] <NodeX> s/thing/result
[06:00:37] <shoky> Chepra_:  what if you try to set opacity:0 before the fadeins  ?
[06:00:44] <Xotix> thx
[06:00:45] <scotdb> I just see the tabs themselves
[06:01:16] <Chepra_> shoky: like .css({'opacity': 0}).fadeIn(300);?
[06:01:28] <scotdb> I see lots of references to problems with IE on Google, but nothing which is the same as this
[06:01:41] <shoky> Chepra_: nm i just tried and it didnt help. it helped me once with a similar prob on IE9 :\
[06:01:50] <amcsi_work> something seems to be setting the top value of my element
[06:01:50] <Chepra_> shoky: :(
[06:02:00] <Chepra_> shoky: ie just sucks (still)
[06:02:20] <fuchstronaut> i dont see how this will change before 2038
[06:02:22] <scotdb> Even a second tab with the PHP href being a simple echo doesn't display this
[06:02:47] <stenno|work> i heard good things about IE10 concerning compat
[06:03:07] <ravenzz> Chepra_ where is the link?
[06:03:20] <Chepra_> ravenzz: http://demagdev.imosnet.de/de/gruppen/25801.meissel-r-10-3-x-36-mm.html
[06:03:42] <amcsi_work> okay I did it by setting top to '' and bottom to 100px
[06:03:45] <ravenzz> ?testcase
[06:03:47] <scotdb> Any clues how to track down and eliminate this IE problem ?   My users are (unfortunately) tied to IE by "corporate policy"
[06:03:57] <ravenzz> ?demo @ Chepra_
[06:04:01] <ravenzz> no bawt

[06:04:36] <ravenzz> Chepra_ what is the problem?
[06:05:00] <Chepra_> ravenzz: the animations do not work in ie8/9
[06:05:50] <ravenzz> yep dude but which one? you gave me a website not a snippet
[06:06:00] <Chepra_> ravenzz: on the menu, sorry ;)
[06:06:05] <NodeX> freenode rocks - true story
[06:06:16] <Chepra_> when you hovering the first menuitems (Produkte, Leistungen)
[06:06:53] <shoky> Chepra_: even if you just run:  $('.menu-overlay-frame-wrapper').css('opacity',0).show()     in the console on IE9
[06:07:04] <shoky> Chepra_: then some of it will show :\
[06:07:09] <amcsi_work> ah it was me, I was messing with my own element somewhere
[06:07:49] <scotdb> http://ec2test.scotdb.com/fmmain.php?fid=4510
[06:07:55] <scotdb> is the screen I have issues with
[06:08:12] <Chepra_> ah wait
[06:08:22] <fuchstronaut> is it possible that chaining children() methods is always faster than using one complicated selector?
[06:09:32] <amcsi_work> thank you, shoky
[06:09:58] <ravenzz> Chepra_ the plugin says "LOG: [cycle] terminating; too few slides: 1"
[06:11:31] <gnagno> hello all
[06:11:48] <ravenzz> try to debug jquery cycle
[06:12:39] <gnagno> if I add an element with a specific class to my page using jquery does it get styled with the style defined in the stylesheet that is already loaded ?
[06:12:45] <Chepra_> ravenzz: thats not the issue
[06:13:09] <Chepra_> the proble was that one element underneath the element which should be animated was absolute positioned
[06:13:14] <shoky> gnagno: yes
[06:13:49] <ravenzz> ok
[06:13:59] <gnagno> shoky, that's strange because I am generating a div in my jquery code, and appending it but it is not getting styled
[06:14:07] <gnagno> and the class is set correctly
[06:14:26] <shoky> gnagno: fiddle it
[06:18:50] <retro|cz> Xotix, here?
[06:19:01] <Xotix> retro|cz:  yes why
[06:19:08] <phr> howdy. guys i need your support again. how can i make seperate arrays from the load() function in snippet http://pastebin.com/D8QeUT3A ?
[06:19:08] <retro|cz> Do you know wgat to do with my problem with trigger?
[06:19:11] <retro|cz> I was afk.
[06:19:28] <retro|cz> And can't scroll to history.
[06:19:33] <Xotix> retro|cz: i thought you solved it with some solution?
[06:19:37] <NodeX> anyone ever used troll.js before ?
[06:20:06] <NodeX> $("#jquery").on('troll','NodeX',function(event) { get.butthurt(); });
[06:20:22] <stenno|work> get.butthurt()?
[06:20:23] <shoky> phr: what do you mean?
[06:20:43] <shoky> phr: also are you sure you want  hideLoader()  as the callback to .load(), and not just 'hideLoader'  ?
[06:20:58] <diverdude> I copied this code: http://jsfiddle.net/XhDux/ from this tutorial: http://www.alistapart.com/articles/expanding-text-areas-made-elegant/ . Would it be possible to convert it to jquery and using a div with contentEditable="true" instead, so that i can insert some font styling as well?
[06:22:04] <phr> shoky $("#search").val() + $('input:radio[name=suche]:checked').val() return me both strings like String1String2 and i'd like to split them
[06:22:19] <phr> shoky that hideloader isnt important in the current case
[06:24:50] <granden> Is it possible to animate the change a element takes when adding a new class to a div?
[06:25:05] <stenno|work> granden, nope, but funny idea :)
[06:25:06] <granden> lets say the new class have some css transforms etc?
[06:25:26] <granden> stenno|work: I thought, instead of doing animate({}) and specifiying everything there
[06:25:33] <granden> could just have a css-class for all that.
[06:27:06] <shoky> diverdude here it is in jquery: http://jsfiddle.net/XhDux/1/
[06:28:42] <diverdude> shoky: ohh nice. thx :) is it possible to do underlining as well in the textarea?
[06:29:05] <shoky> diverdude: you're welcome to start experimenting ;p
[06:37:46] <diverdude> shoky: it was much easier :D Just like this: http://jsfiddle.net/kvXH9/1/
[06:39:11] <shoky> well yea contenteditable is editable ;p
[06:40:40] <Trudko> guys why would I want to use val() if value function is good enough for text fields?
[06:41:05] <Trudko> and val() and creating jquery object could be slighlty slower
[06:49:22] <xec> Trudko: you wouldn't ;)
[06:49:45] <Trudko> xec :) heh so no advantage pretty much?
[06:50:06] <novochar> there is still something wrong with this as well: javascript: (function() {window.open("http://localhost:8000/doit", "do it!");}) ()
[06:50:07] <xec> as far as i know
[06:50:19] <novochar> wrong channel
[06:58:57] <hacfi> novochar: window.open? I think you mean window.location
[07:00:07] <xec> hacfi: what?
[07:00:09] <xec> why
[07:00:10] <novochar> hacfi: nope
[07:00:27] <novochar> i want to open a window and have the contents from the localhost displayed there
[07:00:29] <xec> hacfi: window.open() is a function, whereas window.location is not
[07:09:16] <raj> is there any nicer way to do vertical tabs than this? view-source:http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demos/tabs/vertical.html
[07:11:08] <hacfi> sorry, didn't see the second argument there
[07:24:30] <maltray> Hello guys, I've a question, Im getting an error on 2 servers (Uncaught TypeError: cannot call method 'apply' of undefined), thing is that in my localhost I cant reproduce the bug
[07:24:44] <maltray> I think its something to do with the document.ready (function..
[07:29:00] <fuchstronaut> (maltray): it's a hard guess without code examples ;-)
[07:32:38] <abcNocturn> Hi, is this a proper Jquery-Code ?
[07:32:38] <abcNocturn> jQuery("#tarifboxnormal1 > .p_teaserimage").html
[07:32:38] <abcNocturn> Trying to get all elements of Class p_teaser.. in #tarifboxnormal1
[07:33:18] <Brodingo> abcNocturn you need to use parens for the html() method
[07:33:35] <diverdude> would it be possible to bind jquery autocomplete to a div tag instead of a input field?
[07:33:45] <abcNocturn> jQuery("#tarifboxnormal1 > .p_teaserimage").html('') won't clear those fields either
[07:34:15] <Brodingo> abcNocturn youre trying to get elements or your trying to clear fields?
[07:34:47] <Brodingo> ?html @ abcNocturn
[07:34:48] <bot-t> abcNocturn, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[07:35:22] <Brodingo> you can either get or set depending on your argument
[07:38:20] <diverdude> any1?
[07:39:15] <laszlof> a div area doesnt allow input. how would autocomplete be useful here?
[07:39:21] <hooloovoo> diverdude: probably
[07:39:35] <hooloovoo> diverdude: but how do you plan on getting the text in there?
[07:40:02] <diverdude> hooloovoo: contenteditable=true
[07:40:18] <diverdude> laszlof: also ^
[07:40:31] <hooloovoo> diverdude: ahh ok
[07:40:48] <laszlof> i dont really see the benefit of that over a textbox. but ok
[07:41:09] <diverdude> laszlof: you can style a div, and a inputfield you cannot?
[07:41:21] <laszlof> you can style a text box
[07:41:38] <diverdude> laszlof: oh really? underline words, make bold font, insert images?
[07:41:45] <laszlof> yup
[07:41:57] <diverdude> laszlof: how is that done?
[07:42:00] <laszlof> css
[07:42:18] <diverdude> in a <input type="text"/> ?
[07:42:25] <laszlof> yes
[07:42:30] <diverdude> im pretty sure you are wrong
[07:42:48] <laszlof> http://www.456bereastreet.com/lab/styling-form-controls-revisited/text-input-single/
[07:42:52] <laszlof> theres a few examples
[07:43:21] <laszlof> but there is much more possible.
[07:43:28] <hooloovoo> diverdude: he is right
[07:43:57] <diverdude> so also make one word bold, another underline, insert a box with an image that can be clicked on?
[07:43:59] <laszlof> http://css-tricks.com/styling-texty-inputs-only/
[07:44:28] <laszlof> you'd probably have a float a div over the text box to make a "clickable" image
[07:44:32] <hooloovoo> diverdude: it works almost exactly like a div
[07:44:46] <laszlof> but you can set a background image
[07:45:55] <diverdude> basically what i am trying to do is like facebook, when you send a message, you start typing the name of the reciever. up comes a autocomplete and you pick a suggestion. A box is inserted in the input tag , which can be removed again by clicking it
[07:46:18] <diverdude> and you can insert several recievers ofc.
[07:47:01] <abcNocturn> you can also set the content of a field with html, html( htmlString  )
[07:47:23] <laszlof> diverdude: ah. yeah, I'd probably use a div for that as well
[07:47:43] <laszlof> expanding textboxes for multiline input isnt really ideal
[07:47:57] <abcNocturn> the funktion works if I use jQuery(" .p_teaserimage").html('') , but it clears all .p_teaserimages, and not the specified one
[07:48:00] <laszlof> or, just have a textbox, and have a div above it
[07:48:11] <laszlof> and update the div on the autocomplete select function
[07:48:35] <Whirl3d> ^^ that's the ticket
[07:49:30] <Whirl3d> and handle the keyboard keypress event to check for , or ; to auto-add the next address and clear the field
[07:49:46] <diverdude> laszlof: do you know if it wold be possible to utilize the existing autocomplete ?
[07:49:56] <laszlof> using the method I specified it should be
[07:50:14] <laszlof> use a textbox for the actual input, and store the results in a div above it
[07:50:21] <laszlof> thats likely how FB does it
[07:50:40] <laszlof> when I say results, I mean when they click on a name
[07:50:51] <diverdude> laszlof: did you try the facebook functionality?
[07:51:05] <laszlof> though, I'm not sure if you'll be able to style the autocomplete results with images
[07:51:15] <laszlof> no, i havent tried anything. I'm just giving you ideas.
[07:52:00] <diverdude> laszlof: i think that is possible..i can just override the render function
[07:52:17] <laszlof> hm. yeah. maybe do some type of picture lookup based on the name
[07:52:36] <diverdude> laszlof: yeah...i dont think thats so much a problem
[07:53:49] <bradmaxs> I am trying to find a good way to make a radio button checked based on a value from my database.  IE - 1 thru 5. Any suggestions?  Thanks.
[07:54:16] <diverdude> bradmaxs: ajax?
[07:55:12] <scotdb> Fixed my IE problem ... I had a PHP file which included all my JQuery JS code and one of the PHP files it called also did this ... splitting the JS out into page specific JS fixes it
[07:55:50] <bradmaxs> diverdude: how are you?  we are wandering away from cake:)  At first page load it just needs to be read and applied.  The submit function is ajax but I am not worrying about that yet.
[07:57:16] <DerekPioneer> i have property this.widthRatio on a backbone model, that property seems to turn into 'undefined' once i go inside an each statement though
[07:58:38] <johnline> http://jsfiddle.net/RP2hJ/ < my hovertext script works in jq1.7.1
[07:58:52] <johnline> http://jsfiddle.net/RP2hJ/1/ < but in 1.7.2 its bugged
[07:59:01] <johnline> cant work out why, was something depricated?
[08:00:48] <hacfi> johnline, what doesn't work??
[08:01:27] <johnline> when you hover the boxes the <b> text from the html isnt read, but it shows a link instead
[08:02:40] <shoky> johnline: why are you setting the <b>'s text to 'this'  ?
[08:02:43] <diverdude> bradmaxs: ok?
[08:02:53] <johnline> i am not sure :x
[08:03:03] <shoky> ok then make sure.
[08:03:11] <hacfi> johnline, remove this from text()
[08:03:13] <bradmaxs> diverdude: I think I have it
[08:03:18] <bradmaxs> thanks
[08:03:29] <hacfi> works like a charm tthen ;)
[08:03:52] <hacfi> instead of reading the text your were setting it!
[08:04:07] <johnline> oh
[08:04:17] <johnline> thanks guys
[08:04:48] <diverdude> bradmaxs: good
[08:21:29] <kryl> hi
[08:21:49] <black_warlock> guys
[08:21:51] <black_warlock> hello
[08:21:56] <black_warlock> why this wont wok ?
[08:21:57] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/b62TV/2/
[08:22:08] <black_warlock> its simple check that disable an input
[08:22:23] <kryl> what's wrong there ? : tid = $('form[name="'+tid+'"] input[name="the_id"').val();
[08:22:54] <kryl> I receive : undefined without error msg and the first tid value is the name of form.
[08:23:11] <kryl> I have 2 different form
[08:23:23] <kryl> and I want to select the good input in the good form :)
[08:26:14] <vandunk> Can anyone suggest where to start? I need to create something similar to this using a promise/deferred approach. http://pastebin.com/b4mqWkWz
[08:26:53] <kryl> :-(
[08:29:45] <shoky> vandunk: what exactly do you want/need?
[08:32:00] <black_warlock> any help why this wont work ? http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/b62TV/2/
[08:32:20] <vandunk> Well, I have that loop, but it seems crude and isn't working very well. Sometimes it just stops randomly and I'm not sure why. Someone told me to rewrite it using promise and deferred. I'm trying to read about them and look at examples but it seems over my head.
[08:32:58] <JonYoder> Hey! I can't figure why jQuery isn't working on this page: http://www.jonyoder.com/testblog/archives/ linked to: http://www.jonyoder.com/testblog/wp-content/themes/jons-clean-home/jonscleanscript.js
[08:32:59] <vandunk> I'm basically trying to load 39 isotope objects sequentially (i.e. after add the next after the image loads).
[08:33:25] <vandunk> I'm wondering if there's a simple way to do that using promise/deferred or if it is going to be pretty complicated.. (3rd day with js/jq)
[08:34:02] <shoky> vandunk: what loop?
[08:34:30] <vandunk> Sorry, I mean the (sort of?) recursive function here: http://pastebin.com/b4mqWkWz
[08:34:46] <shoky> black_warlock: id's can't have spaces..
[08:35:14] <shoky> vandunk: oh
[08:35:30] <shoky> vandunk: sec
[08:35:47] <vandunk> Okay.
[08:36:25] <maltray> Ok this is weird, I get an error when the chrome console is closed, but if chrome console is open I dont...., any of you guys have experienced something like this?
[08:36:46] <rodd> A bit of paranoia, Would you set a specific content/string that'll be used often by js in a var in your html, or query it with jquery (and then perhaps apply trim and other fn to normalize it)?
[08:36:59] <laszlof> console.log wont work (in some browsers) if the debugger console is closed
[08:37:15] <NoiseEee> rodd: explain
[08:37:16] <rodd> Just having in mind that someone or something might change the content of the div you may query later in your js
[08:37:28] <NoiseEee> rodd: whichever you choose, it still might be manipulated after the fact
[08:37:39] <rodd> Thats true
[08:37:46] <NoiseEee> rodd: nothing in JS can be trusted
[08:38:03] <NoiseEee> rodd: if you need to confirm/check, send some sort of token to the backend to authorize etc
[08:38:05] <rodd> however, it would be 'easier' for a user to update a div with firebug or whatever
[08:38:24] <NoiseEee> "query it with jquery" means what, use xhr/ajax?
[08:38:32] <rodd> $()
[08:38:33] <rodd> selectr
[08:39:05] <NoiseEee> im not sure exactly what you're doing or talking about, so i'll leave it up to yiou
[08:39:09] <rodd> I guess it doesnt matter
[08:39:15] <rodd> alright
[08:39:17] <rodd> =p
[08:39:22] <NoiseEee> good luck :)
[08:40:58] <systemfault-> HAI
[08:41:22] <jedimind> OH HAI
[08:41:46] <JonYoder> Well...this is weird. My jQuery works in IE but not FF or Chrome.
[08:42:15] <shoky> vandunk: something like this:  http://jsfiddle.net/djwnJ/
[08:42:22] <maltray> JonYoder; my jquery works on IE and firefox and chrome with the console open but not on chrome with the console closed...
[08:42:54] <JonYoder> hmmm...
[08:43:03] <Spark_On> hello
[08:43:41] <JonYoder> maltray: yeah...you're right. It's working in Chrome with the console open.
[08:43:59] <Spark_On> here is the javascript code to make the url links change to rainbow colors when hovered. http://pastebin.com/MZCeNQwh
[08:44:35] <laszlof> maltray: paste the code on jsfiddle
[08:44:40] <Spark_On> but it is conflicting with jquery code and is there anyway to non conflict it or any jquery code to achieve the same rainbow effect for the links hovered
[08:45:27] <Chirag> hooloovoo: are you free?
[08:45:56] <shoky> vandunk sorry
[08:46:03] <vandunk> shoky: Thank you so much, that looks like the sort of thing I'm looking for. I'll spend some time seeing if I can work it out!
[08:46:15] <DeltaHeavy> I have focus and focusout events on the same input text box. When I focus in and out quickly, it wrecks the CSS and idk why. Does jQuery bug out when running into rapid css changing? If I provide a link to the page is anybody interested in looking?
[08:46:23] <maltray> JonYoder: rofl really? and i tought i was the only one who was having that problem lol
[08:46:35] <Spark_On> any help with it?
[08:46:35] <shoky> vandunk i put dfd.done instead of dfd.resolve,  this is correct:  http://jsfiddle.net/djwnJ/1/
[08:46:39] <DeltaHeavy> My Ubuntu installation is starting to every so often mess up all theme colours making things appear very oddly. It's also now for some reason taking me ~30 seconds to open up Chrome after a fresh boot and login. Are there any solutions for this problem?
[08:46:44] <maltray> laszlof its a lot of code though, ill paste the document.ready stuffs
[08:46:48] <DeltaHeavy> Blah wrong channel that last message
[08:47:13] <Chirag> Can anyone help me?
[08:47:15] <vandunk> shoky: Amazing!
[08:47:16] <JonYoder> haha...well I just noticed it. maltray: in Google it seems that nobody else is having the problem. I see not working in IE, but not only workin in IE.
[08:47:32] <vandunk> shoky: That's exactly what I needed, thank you so much.
[08:47:35] <shoky> ;]
[08:47:48] <laszlof> if you're using console commands, they wont work if you do not have the debugger console open
[08:47:56] <laszlof> some browsers will silently ignore them
[08:48:01] <laszlof> some (like IE) will throw an error
[08:48:38] <maltray> yeh thing is that if that is what is happening to me then it should happen always, and it doesnt, i need to do the same thing 2 - 3 times to reproduce the bug
[08:48:43] <maltray> sometimes it comes up first
[08:48:58] <maltray> JonYoder; i googled about it too and found not much regarding to the error im having :/
[08:49:01] <Chirag> Cannjeff , Archer_xda: You there?
[08:50:03] <black_warlock> thanks
[08:50:45] <Chirag> I am stuck. Somebody please help.
[08:51:38] <laszlof> Chirag: just ask your question.
[08:52:07] <Chirag> laszlof : Thanks. Here it is. Imagine a vertical menu of checkboxes in which except one checkbox(of id 'all'), all other checkboxes have vertical submenus of checkboxes. The checkbox of id 'all' should be checked automatically if I check all other checkboxes & it should be unchecked automatically if I uncheck any of the other checkboxes.
[08:52:31] <Chirag> Any idea how to do?
[08:52:45] <Spark_On> here is the javascript code to make the url links change to rainbow colors when hovered. http://pastebin.com/MZCeNQwh
[08:52:47] <Spark_On> but it is conflicting with jquery code and is there anyway to non conflict it or any jquery code to achieve the same rainbow effect for the links hovered
[08:53:10] <shoky> maltray: where's the link?
[08:53:48] <Chirag> laszlof: any idea, buddy?
[08:54:22] <JonYoder> maltray: I see some references to console.log, but no solutions yet.
[08:55:09] <Chirag> laszlof: Should I make a pastebin?
[08:55:29] <laszlof> Chirag: patience is a virtue
[08:55:42] <Chirag> Ok. M waiting
[08:55:47] <shoky> Chirag: make a jsfiddle of what you've tried so far..
[08:55:59] <Chirag> Shoky : Ok
[08:57:47] <Chirag> shoky: here you go. http://jsfiddle.net/wfj7h/
[08:58:01] <arcanine> hello
[08:58:15] <shoky> Chirag: a working jsfiddle, showing your issue..
[08:58:37] <arcanine> how can I use the ajax functionality in jquery to call a php file on my server and execute it's contents?
[08:58:53] <Chirag> shoky: is it not workig?
[08:58:56] <shoky> arcanine: $.ajax or $.post or $.get etc.
[08:59:04] <shoky> Chirag: i dont see anything in the fiddle result..
[08:59:45] <maltray> shoky; let me try one thing and ill paste
[09:00:01] <Chirag> shoky: Oh yes. Actually it uses jSon. Wait a while . I'll out it in javascript panel.
[09:00:20] <Chirag> I'll put it in js panel
[09:00:34] <JonYoder> Okay...I figured out my problem. I had a bracket missing at the end of my .js file. :|
[09:00:55] <shoky> Chirag: you're asking a question about checkboxes, dont put any json anywhere, just checkboxes and code to manipulate those checkboxes :\
[09:01:30] <DeltaHeavy> I have focus and focusout events on the same input text box. When I focus in and out quickly, it wrecks the CSS and idk why. Does jQuery bug out when running into rapid css changing? If I provide a link to the page is anybody interested in looking?
[09:01:33] <Chirag> shoky: ok
[09:04:01] <laszlof> Chirag: http://jsfiddle.net/zE9fY/1/
[09:04:25] <Chirag> shoky: Actually the checkboxes are generated in $.getJSON()
[09:04:35] <Chirag> laszlof: I'll check it.
[09:06:54] <arcanine> I've tried: http://pastebin.com/j4UeTymd but the alert never triggers the file exists
[09:08:33] <Chirag> laszlof: Thanks dude. But there's one thing remaining to do. The checkbox of id "all" should be unchecked automatically if I uncheck any of the other checkboxes.
[09:09:15] <NoiseEee> Chirag: so how might you go about making that happen?
[09:09:19] <laszlof> Chirag: http://jsfiddle.net/zE9fY/2/
[09:10:17] <sc00bydoo> I have a slideshow with a pager on top of the slide show. I want to have the pager show when you have the mouse over the slide show, what is better to use:  onhover, mouseenter, mouseover?  I have been trying mouseenter and onhover but I get a flickering effect with the pager, any recommendations?
[09:10:34] <diverdude> laszlof: hehe...look what i found: http://code.drewwilson.com/entry/autosuggest-jquery-plugin
[09:10:57] <laszlof> diverdude: nice, looks like exactly what you need
[09:11:25] <laszlof> hasnt been updated in a couple years though, hopefully it still works
[09:11:26] <jeffsmykil> Do I really get three questions?  Really?  Really?
[09:11:28] <diverdude> laszlof: yeah...and seems like pretty easy styling as well
[09:12:03] <diverdude> laszlof: true..maybe its a dead plugin
[09:12:27] <Chirag> laszlof: You owe me a beer. Thanks a lot. Its working. I could have done the 'else' part. But thank you anyway
[09:14:00] <ekneuss> Hi, I'm trying to do an action when a select option is selected, now it works well with .change() except that if the selected element does not change, it does not trigger change(). Anything I could use to also detect when the same element is selected ?
[09:14:37] <jeffsmykil> ekneuss: I have been down that road, not fun at all
[09:14:43] <ekneuss> jeffsmykil, meh :/
[09:15:04] <jeffsmykil> ekneuss: It seems you can't rely on the change to fire unless the item in the list is unselected
[09:15:27] <jeffsmykil> ekneuss: I don't remember what I did, but I couldn'
[09:15:30] <laszlof> store the value of the select item in a variable
[09:15:31] <jeffsmykil> 't find a solution
[09:15:40] <laszlof> then check it in the .change() event to see if its actually changed
[09:15:51] <jeffsmykil> that would probably work
[09:15:58] <jeffsmykil> and in retrospect i feel silly
[09:16:14] <ekneuss> laszlof, but .change will not even be called if you select the same element
[09:16:24] <jeffsmykil> mine though was if they opened and ten closed it and didnt change anything
[09:16:27] <Haprog> couldn't you just bind click also?
[09:16:49] <jeffsmykil> Haprog: to the select?
[09:16:54] <ekneuss> click seems fine, thanks!
[09:17:08] <jeffsmykil> it does
[09:17:13] <jeffsmykil> but then what about if its open
[09:17:15] <jeffsmykil> and you click it
[09:17:15] <ekneuss> I assumed it would trigger when opening the options
[09:17:17] <Haprog> hmm though ti probably fires as soon as you open the selection :D
[09:17:19] <jeffsmykil> it will fire again
[09:17:22] <Haprog> *it
[09:17:25] <laszlof> click will trigger when you open it
[09:17:33] <ekneuss> apparently not
[09:17:34] <jeffsmykil> and when you click on an option
[09:17:39] <Haprog> maybe you could try binding click on all options? not sure it would work on all browsers though
[09:17:51] <Haprog> you could try it
[09:18:03] <ekneuss> it does not seem to trigger when opening
[09:18:19] <jeffsmykil> ekneuss: I can't remember if chosen has more hooks for this type of thing
[09:18:30] <jeffsmykil> http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[09:19:10] <NoiseEee> ekneuss: you could also monitor the element for blur() and get its value then
[09:19:25] <Haprog> should be easier if you use some plugin that remakes the whole select input from other elements
[09:19:26] <jeffsmykil> i dont think blur fires until you click off of the select
[09:19:32] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: right
[09:20:29] <Haprog> jeffsmykil: that chosen looks neat. thx for the link
[09:20:54] <jeffsmykil> NoiseEee: that has always given me trouble in the past because it's not reliable to tell when the select has "closed"
[09:20:59] <ekneuss> NoiseEee, doesn't blur occur when you actually click somewhere else ?
[09:21:05] <jeffsmykil> Haprog: it's pretty nice
[09:21:10] <jeffsmykil> Haprog: and degrades nicely
[09:21:26] <jeffsmykil> some IE 9 rendering issues related to gradients and rounded corners though
[09:21:54] <laszlof> wait a second
[09:22:03] <laszlof> .change() shouldnt trigger if you do not actually change the value
[09:22:14] <ekneuss> it doens't, that was my problem
[09:22:21] <ekneuss> but click works just fine
[09:22:28] <laszlof> i must be misunderstanding what you're trying to do
[09:22:33] <NoiseEee> but the click fires before one changes the value.
[09:22:35] <jeffsmykil> but does click fire again when you select an actually option
[09:22:44] <sc00bydoo> I have a slideshow with a pager on top of the slide show. I want to have the pager show when you have the mouse over the slide show, what is better to use:  onhover, mouseenter, mouseover?  I have been trying mouseenter and onhover but I get a flickering effect with the pager, any recommendations?
[09:23:13] <ekneuss> .click seems to fire only when an option is clicked, not when opening the select
[09:23:27] <ekneuss> and it seems to fire after the value is changed as well
[09:23:30] <laszlof> you could try using mouseout
[09:24:25] <jeffsmykil> you could filter every other mouse click :-p
[09:24:29] <ekneuss> mouseout fires as soon as you click on the select
[09:24:37] <ekneuss> which is too early
[09:25:07] <laszlof> no it doesnt
[09:25:10] <shoky> sc00bydoo: .hover() is just a shortcut for mouseenter/mouseleave.  the other option is mouseover/mouseout. to see the difference see the bottom demo here: http://api.jquery.com/mouseover/
[09:26:20] <laszlof> http://jsfiddle.net/RYERV/
[09:26:21] <ekneuss> hover didn't work properly
[09:26:25] <laszlof> theres an example of what i mean
[09:26:47] <ekneuss> here it triggers as soon as I click the select
[09:26:49] <ekneuss> (chrome)
[09:27:10] <laszlof> not doing that here (also in chrome)
[09:27:18] <shoky> nor here
[09:27:32] <ekneuss> my chrome is maybe a bit outdated: 18.0.1025.142
[09:27:38] <shoky> a bit
[09:27:44] <laszlof> it will trigger if you just mouse past it
[09:27:58] <laszlof> but if you're storing the original value and only want to do something when it changes, it shouldnt be an issue
[09:28:41] <raj> jquery-ui.css should not have !important in there
[09:29:53] <gnarf> raj: in where?
[09:30:11] <raj> ?
[09:30:12] <raj> .css
[09:32:07] <gnarf> raj: I don't believe we do have any !important
[09:33:06] <gnarf> at least a quick grep of my css files in the repo doesn't show any
[09:33:15] <gnarf> and I don't recall us using any
[09:34:19] <raj> gnarf, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/themes/base/jquery.ui.tabs.css
[09:34:56] <gnarf> hrm
[09:35:00] <gnarf> i wonder why thats there
[09:35:09] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ? ^^^
[09:35:13] <raj> i have it in my downloaded copy too
[09:35:41] <shoky> there's !important in like 6 places..
[09:35:51] <raj> gnarf, if I use a more specific selector, what takes precedence? the more specific selector or !important?
[09:35:54] <gnarf> i apparently spelt it wront
[09:35:59] <gnarf> raj: !important wins
[09:36:03] <raj> damn
[09:36:07] <raj> very bad
[09:36:11] <gnarf> raj: you have to !important and be more specific/defined later to win
[09:36:12] <raj> there should be no !impotant
[09:36:20] <raj> now I have to riddle my css with !important
[09:36:36] <gnarf> i agree, !important is not generally a good thing
[09:36:39] <gnarf> because of those issues
[09:36:46] <raj> it's just not needed
[09:36:56] <gnarf> but perhaps scott_gonzalez knows why it exists in our CSS - it might actually "be needed"
[09:37:00] <raj> if jquery-ui.css just used the most specific selector, it'd be fine
[09:37:19] <scott_gonzalez> unknown
[09:37:30] <DeltaHeavy> I have focus and focusout events on the same input text box. When I focus in and out quickly, it wrecks the CSS and idk why. Does jQuery bug out when running into rapid css changing? If I provide a link to the page is anybody interested in looking?
[09:37:38] <raj> scott_gonzalez, jquery-ui is yours?
[09:37:41] <scott_gonzalez> raj: Can you file a ticket about this?
[09:37:49] <shoky> go raj go
[09:38:21] <scott_gonzalez> raj: Yeah, pretty much. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/graphs/contributors
[09:39:14] <raj> pretty cool, haven't seen you in here before
[09:39:17] <gnarf> raj: its "ours" :)
[09:39:26] <gnarf> jQuery!
[09:39:29] <raj> oh ya? meaning me too?
[09:39:40] <shoky> if you file the ticket
[09:39:44] <gnarf> if you want to fix the !important (after you file a ticket) please do and file a pull
[09:39:46] <gnarf> :)
[09:39:46] <jeffsmykil> I wish there was some sort of bocoup readiness test
[09:41:18] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, it and everything else in the jquery account belong to the collective jQuery team.

[09:42:19] <DeltaHeavy> If I run all my AJAX quries with 'xhr = $.ajax({' then run 'xhr.abort()', shouldn't that stop the query?
[09:44:11] <ngharo> belong to the jquery team? 0_o
[09:44:17] <ngharo> open source bro WOOO!
[09:46:00] <johnline> guys i heard as ur laptop gets older it loses bits as it gets older i have a 64bit samsong laptop but it has gone down to 23bit i need a new one
[09:46:25] <laszlof> should have bought a mac
[09:46:32] <laszlof> they are bit-loss resistant
[09:47:56] <johnline> you dont buy macs
[09:47:59] <johnline> you steal them
[09:48:32] <shoky> down to 23bit.. very nice
[09:53:12] <johnline> http://wilwheaton.tumblr.com/post/25025499380/so-freaking-true
[10:02:00] <jeffsmykil> I feel like loading 26 js files on page load is bad even on an intranet application
[10:02:46] <laszlof> meh, if they're cached, I wouldnt be too concerned
[10:03:14] <jeffsmykil> really?
[10:03:16] <coldhead> orr you could concatenate and minify them and impress everyone with zippy loading
[10:03:19] <coldhead> all day every day
[10:03:27] <jeffsmykil> cached they are like 60k uncached they are like 612k
[10:03:37] <jeffsmykil> yeah I wanted to compress
[10:03:45] <jeffsmykil> they say it reaquires a qa cyckle
[10:03:49] <jeffsmykil> cycle @_@
[10:04:04] <coldhead> you can set up a build process pretty easy
[10:04:12] <coldhead> check out uglify or google closure compiler
[10:04:28] <coldhead> you can use node.js and do it all with JS
[10:04:32] <coldhead> turtles all the way
[10:04:40] <laszlof> http://jscompress.com/
[10:04:50] <jeffsmykil> yeah im saying these engineers
[10:04:57] <jeffsmykil> want to send a build to qa with it minified
[10:05:47] <jeffsmykil> because they think things will break by minifying
[10:06:33] <jeffsmykil> i dont feel like that is a reasonable fear, but im out numbered and they are engineers
[10:07:47] <laszlof> its extremely difficult to debug with minified code. You're better off waiting until it goes to production before doing that
[10:08:05] <jeffsmykil> laszlof: they think it will introduce bugs or something
[10:08:31] <zamba> i'm not getting .data(key, value) to work.. can this be set to any element in the DOM tree?
[10:08:43] <laszlof> jeffsmykil: tell them they havent a clue what you're talking about, nor do they know what minifying does
[10:09:20] <jeffsmykil> laszlof: im the stupid front end guy
[10:09:52] <laszlof> tell them to read the docs here: https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS
[10:09:56] <zamba> nevermind, got it working :)
[10:09:59] <zamba> hehe
[10:11:21] <coldhead> jeffsmykil: you might like to point out that gmail uses minified JS and it works JUST FINE
[10:11:40] <coldhead> the minifiers are written by people much smarter than anyone at your company, no offense <3
[10:11:54] <jeffsmykil> qa is telling me the same thing
[10:12:08] <coldhead> it should run faster, really, is the most significant effect
[10:12:10] <jeffsmykil> that it has to follow the same process procedure for distributed releases
[10:13:08] <coldhead> you should get a new job, babe
[10:13:11] <jeffsmykil> is there one with an automated test suite?
[10:13:29] <coldhead> i dont think there's an off the shelf minifier and tester
[10:13:35] <coldhead> but you can roll your own pretty easy
[10:13:46] <coldhead> sure to be a bunch of blogs on setting it up
[10:14:00] <coldhead> you DO have to write all the tests though
[10:14:24] <jeffsmykil> ill talk to the contractor which everyone always agrees with
[10:14:30] <jeffsmykil> err is made to agree with
[10:14:44] <coldhead> hahahah
[10:14:53] <coldhead> that's good upward management, kudos
[10:15:03] <jeffsmykil> lol
[10:15:08] <jeffsmykil> bbiab ;)
[10:15:28] <bradmaxs> I need to get the value of  > rating":[[{"rating":"3.83333333"}]] < out of this json response but it seems to be embedded too deep.  How to extract it?
[10:16:03] <coldhead> result[0][0].rating
[10:16:07] <laszlof> var[0][0].rating
[10:16:11] <laszlof> ^
[10:16:26] <coldhead> case closed
[10:16:33] <bradmaxs> coldhead: laszlof: thank you both!
[10:16:47] <bradmaxs> ha!
[10:17:10] <coldhead> bradmaxs: the firebug/web inspector console is great for playing around with data like that
[10:17:15] <coldhead> to see what you need to do
[10:17:44] <coldhead> if you just type the name of the var and hit ENTER you'll see an inspectable object
[10:17:53] <coldhead> and you can figure it out from there
[10:18:01] <bradmaxs> coldhead: I haven't been able to figure that out.  Somewhat of a newbie to JS.  I'll try that, thank you.
[10:18:54] <coldhead> that's what i'm saying, bradmaxs, the console is a great place to experiment. get to grips with it :)
[10:20:01] <bradmaxs> coldhead: on my way:)  I am going to google some tuts on it now.  need to clean up all of my js so this will probably help me do that better.
[10:20:04] <bradmaxs> thanks again!
[10:24:00] <jeffsmykil> coldhead: Can the server GZip the files or do you always gzip them ahead of time?
[10:24:29] <coldhead> absolutely you should leave that to the server, jeffsmykil
[10:24:45] <jeffsmykil> so should i compress them first?
[10:24:49] <coldhead> because then the server can work out to serve unzipped stuff to stupid browsers
[10:24:58] <coldhead> you want to concatenate and minify
[10:25:04] <coldhead> in that order
[10:25:04] <jeffsmykil> yes
[10:25:05] <jeffsmykil> that
[10:25:26] <jeffsmykil> AND have the server Gzip?
[10:25:46] <coldhead> yes, jeffsmykil
[10:25:58] <coldhead> it can zip everything then for you, html+css+js
[10:26:11] <coldhead> while you kick back in a jacuzzi with a pina colada
[10:26:17] <jeffsmykil> coldhead: we are using asp
[10:26:22] <jeffsmykil> and IIS
[10:26:22] <coldhead> and feel your bank account swell up
[10:26:29] <coldhead> oh well then i can't help you with the config
[10:26:35] <coldhead> but i'm pretty sure it's still possible
[10:26:39] <coldhead> also: change jobs <3
[10:27:14] <jeffsmykil> coldhead: how many web apps do you think you have built in your life?
[10:27:42] <jeffsmykil> and coldhead in your opinnion you should always conatenate and minify after qa
[10:28:50] <coldhead> jeffsmykil: i guess maybe a hundred?
[10:28:57] <tw2113> thousand?
[10:29:19] <coldhead> i prefer to compress your JS etc as late as possible in the process
[10:29:22] <jeffsmykil> lol and you think your opinnion ismore valid than a bunch of engineers that never have but know C#
[10:29:28] <coldhead> so you can debug with the full JS on a test server or whatever
[10:29:39] <coldhead> because it's easier with unminified stuff
[10:29:56] <coldhead> but you shouldn't need to debug on production so you can go nuts there
[10:30:17] <coldhead> i certainly doubt my opinion is more valid, i know very little
[10:30:22] <jeffsmykil> so you think it should go through qa again after minify and concacnete
[10:30:24] <coldhead> but i get by
[10:30:43] <coldhead> that's the ideal, jeffsmykil
[10:31:00] <coldhead> mind you you're hearing that from a guy who is currently debugging on production for a site that doesn't minify at all
[10:31:06] <coldhead> so take it with a pill of salt
[10:31:29] <jeffsmykil> i se
[10:31:31] <jeffsmykil> i see
[10:31:44] <jeffsmykil> So to minify and concatnate you need to QA cycles?
[10:32:08] <coldhead> it depends on your resources, bro
[10:32:21] <coldhead> in an ideal world you have QA on test and production
[10:32:36] <coldhead> in the real world you might just have a CEO yelling at you to push everything live now now now
[10:32:54] <coldhead> jeffsmykil: if you want to be a cool guy, take a look at the toolchain you get with http://weblog.bocoup.com/introducing-grunt/
[10:33:14] <coldhead> if you can get that running the engineer types will be in awe
[10:34:20] <jeffsmykil> why do i even care anymore?
[10:35:27] <coldhead> the irrepressible human spirit?
[10:35:32] <tw2113> because you're from earth
[10:36:29] <_helpPlz_> i think you went offtopic lol
[10:39:28] <_helpPlz_> i am learning some particular functions from jquery source, like how they work
[10:41:02] <coldhead> good work, _helpPlz_
[10:41:10] <coldhead> its a glorious adventure
[10:43:31] <_helpPlz_> i have few questions (although i hope to find some answers when paul irish video loads)
[10:44:21] <_helpPlz_> like, why use undefined here  "(function( window, undefined ) {"
[10:45:17] <_helpPlz_> $.extend() works perfectly even with nodes but, why not check if an object is instanceof Node and use cloneNode()?
[10:45:35] <_helpPlz_> i mean call .clone()
[10:55:51] <Daman> Hey, is it a known issue that jquery miscalculates height() for div elements that contain wrapped text?
[10:56:22] <abjorn> If the text is flowing out of the div then it's not miscalculating
[10:56:27] <Daman> Lines that are wrapped due to constraints from the div containing this div are calculated to be 1/2 the actual height
[10:56:33] <abjorn> Otherwise, idk check for a bug report
[10:57:41] <srisw> is it well-defined to use animate on a jquery wrapped dom object before it's put in the DOM?
[10:57:54] <srisw> and it might be put in the DOM before the animation is completed
[10:59:39] <qjh> i have an element i want to scroll to, but it is nested in multiple overflow:auto containers, so all of the containers and the window need to be scrolled to the proper position.  is there a clean way to do this or do i need to select all parents where overflow == auto and adjust them individually?
[11:01:15] <edugonch> Hello, I have a problem here, I need to use a JS library that I can't touch, in this library there is a function and I need to make a callback after that function is execute, this function append some html elements to one div, the problem that I need to solve is that I also need to insert some html elements after this function finish to insert the elements  it will insert.... I also try to use .change() to that div but it did not work, can you help m
[11:01:15] <edugonch> e please
[11:02:53] <Daman> edugonch your question is very hard to understand, but it sounds like you want to use .live()
[11:03:58] <qjh> for what its worth, the browser handles this properly with an anchor in the url - it scrolls the window to the top of the outermost container and then scrolls the other containers so the anchor is in view
[11:06:22] <edugonch> Sorry, I'll try to explaint it better, I have to call a js file that I can't modify, this js file have a function that insert html into a div in my code, so my task is to insert aditional code after this function (in the external js file) finish its execution
[11:06:42] <edugonch> I don't know how I cant use live to solve this problem
[11:07:40] <raj> edugonch, what's calling the first function?
[11:07:42] <NoiseEee> edugonch: you're going to have to poll to see when the content of the div has changed, and then add your code
[11:10:03] <edugonch> raj: the function is being calling at the document.ready only if a cookie exists
[11:10:19] <edugonch> NoiseEee: I'll try what you say
[11:10:29] <raj> so why not just list any other function after it?
[11:10:53] <bradmaxs> how do I use jquery to round a number? thanks
[11:12:57] <_helpPlz_> use Math.floor() why use jquery?
[11:13:03] <_helpPlz_> for rounding number
[11:13:14] <raj> Math.round(25.9) //returns 26
[11:13:16] <edugonch> raj: I can't modify the file, I don't know if after that some other think will be execute
[11:13:28] <bradmaxs> _helpPlz_: thanks.
[11:13:34] <bradmaxs> and raj!
[11:23:12] <Daman> #jquery, why would this cause a .5-1sec freeze in chrome, and be very choppy on firefox? http://www.pastie.org/4081560
[11:25:05] <Daman> ah, I've fixed it. Something was mispositioned.
[11:25:39] <Daman> huh, that's odd, it still sort of freezes my chrome
[11:27:19] <Daman> line 10 is where chrome completely freezes until the animation is finished
[11:27:34] <Daman> updated: http://www.pastie.org/4081577
[11:27:55] <_helpPlz_> Daman, i don't see any use of line 6 ..
[11:28:07] <_helpPlz_> now 4
[11:28:17] <NoiseEee> Daman: similarly i don't see the point of line 10
[11:28:25] <NoiseEee> you're setting the height you asked for
[11:28:32] <Daman> The container slides down, and then the contents fade in.
[11:29:03] <Daman> Line 4 and 7 in the latest(sorry for the whitespace issue) are a hack to permit the hidden div to provide a height
[11:30:42] <NoiseEee> i don't use animate so i cant help, but line 8 in the latest is surely useless
[11:30:54] <Daman> er, you're correct.
[11:31:14] <NoiseEee> aside from that, maybe profile in browser and see whats taking so long
[11:31:20] <Daman> good idea
[11:31:27] <Daman> I'll have to check out a chrome profiler and see what's up
[12:03:49] <Innocentus> hi
[12:03:59] <Innocentus> I got an interesting question :)
[12:04:13] <_helpPlz_> ask :)
[12:04:18] <Emn1ty> i hope so, uninteresting questions are just... uninteresting
[12:04:26] <_helpPlz_> lol
[12:05:59] <Emn1ty> I suppose it truly was uninteresting.
[12:06:11] <MoonSerenity> yeah mustve been
[12:06:42] <bradmaxs> I need to manipulate a preexisting plugin and can't figure out the step I need to manipulate.  Is there a way to stack trace something to see what steps get executed?
[12:09:38] <_helpPlz_> maxs i think this is offtopic but https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/javascript-deobfuscator/ would do i hope
[12:10:49] <Innocentus> there is a list which is renderred on server side which is quite comlex
[12:10:54] <Innocentus> now I would like to ajaxfiy the thing
[12:11:16] <Innocentus> when the user enterred some data, the javascript should fetch the list somehow and fill in the gaps
[12:11:47] <Innocentus> on the other side - building the list directly with javascript based on some arrays would be too complex and would also require to outsource the localization etc to the client
[12:11:51] <Innocentus> what would be a good hybrid?
[12:13:40] <Emn1ty> Innocentus: do you have an example of the list?
[12:13:44] <Innocentus> also the users without javascript will receive the list directly preprocessed on server
[12:14:23] <Innocentus> it is a styles UL list with LIs which contain many different semantic elements (like DL, table, etc.) - the currency and date values are localized on server side
[12:14:51] <Emn1ty> Is this within a container?
[12:16:40] <Emn1ty> Innocentus: are you pulling this from a page, or is it serving only that information?
[12:16:48] <_helpPlz_> Innocentus, what kind of localization? is it regarding those arrays only or some other? i think it would be a good idea to set some <input type="hidden"> for locale and call ajax
[12:17:02] <Emn1ty> ^
[12:18:26] <Innocentus> most of the list stays the same, just some parts are filled with remote information
[12:18:45] <Innocentus> the currency localization is very complex and done by some classes on server
[12:22:04] <_helpPlz_> Innocentus, if its very complex, you can always send strings to server using ajax and get localized values..
[12:22:52] <Emn1ty> As long as its done before the page is rendered, your ajax query should just get whatever it prints out. Unless that remote information is loaded after the page is loaded.
[12:24:59] <raj> how can I make the right portion of the tab clickable? http://68.46.138.78:8080/asdf/settings
[12:25:34] <raj> oh, nm
[12:25:35] <raj> got it
[12:25:58] <lotus> raj, gjgj
[12:26:10] <raj> giggity
[12:27:28] <Innocentus> what do you think about simply sending the whole list to the browser?
[12:27:33] <Innocentus> and the ajax appends it
[12:28:20] <raj> scott_gonzalez, definitely seems like a priority major type of thing :)
[12:29:45] <scott_gonzalez> raj: To be honest, we don't treate minor and major differently today.
[12:30:10] <Innocentus> hm
[12:30:37] <scott_gonzalez> Until we finish the API redesigns, it's either a blocker or not.
[12:30:44] <raj> oh, I guess that's a good thing
[12:30:49] <alexwait> heya jquery citizens. I jave a basic jqueryObject.children('div') call. Occasionally it is returning an object whose selector property is ".children(div)"
[12:30:50] <alexwait> wtf
[12:30:50] <alexwait> :P
[12:30:51] <alexwait> http://i.imgur.com/TdCUe.png
[12:30:56] <scott_gonzalez> We're working through tickets one plugin at a time.
[12:30:56] <alexwait> is a screenshot of a valid result
[12:30:59] <alexwait> next to the one I was talking about
[12:31:20] <raj> scott_gonzalez, ah right, when's the redesign expected?
[12:31:33] <shoky> laaaater
[12:31:45] <Spark_On> here is the javascript code to make the url links change to rainbow colors when hovered. http://pastebin.com/MZCeNQwh   is there any way to make it non conflict with jquery?
[12:31:47] <scott_gonzalez> raj: You can see the differnce between widgets that were in the 1.9 roadmap and widgets that are in future releases: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/29
[12:32:32] <bradmaxs> _helpPlz_: thanks.  ran out for a moment and didn't see your response.
[12:32:33] <scott_gonzalez> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Roadmap
[12:32:35] <raj> dude, very nice
[12:33:11] <scott_gonzalez> 1.9 is MASSIVE
[12:33:14] <shoky> Spark_On: what's the conflict exactly?
[12:33:21] <scott_gonzalez> I'm very much looking forward to finally releasing it.
[12:33:25] <scott_gonzalez> 2.2k+ commits
[12:33:34] <raj> holy cow
[12:33:35] <shoky> yowza
[12:33:41] <Spark_On> like, dislike for the posts is not working as it works with jquery
[12:33:55] <Spark_On> when i remove this javascript code it works
[12:34:08] <lahwran> if I do $("stuff").change(function(){stuff}); then how do I remove the handler?
[12:34:14] <shoky> i don't see any $.fn.dislike , maybe that's it
[12:34:38] <GoGoGarrett> is anything wrong with $('select option:selected').appendTo('#another_select')   <- i'm trying to select all of the selected options in a mutliselect form
[12:34:47] <Spark_On> this code is independent and it just changes color of links when hovered
[12:35:03] <Spark_On> like dislike code is different and works on jquery
[12:35:30] <NoiseEee> GoGoGarrett: i give up, are you getting an error?
[12:35:39] <shoky> so there is a conflict with the dislike code, ne?
[12:35:44] <GoGoGarrett> It's not appending to the other select, and if i call .length it's 0
[12:35:49] <GoGoGarrett> but they're definitly selected options
[12:37:30] <raj> i notice you guys aren't using .tabs() for tabs in http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138038/Roadmap :)
[12:37:59] <NoiseEee> GoGoGarrett: http://jsfiddle.net/WkUqQ/
[12:39:16] <scott_gonzalez> raj: It's a hosted wiki.
[12:39:40] <scott_gonzalez> raj: It seems like the !important isn't needed at all, even without changing the selector.
[12:40:19] <scott_gonzalez> raj: I've only tested Chroe so far. I'm going to check if any other browsers are doing something weird.
[12:44:20] <raj> scott_gonzalez, that's what it seemed to me
[12:45:23] <raj> !important is really never needed, especially from the base css that jquery-ui is providing anyway...since jquery-ui isn't actually overriding anything anyway...and if it is, it can just use a more specific selector, me thinks
[12:46:13] <scott_gonzalez> raj: Yeah, tabs is working fine everywhere. I even tested some old browsers like Opera 10.0 and Firefox 3.6 to see if there was some bug but it worked fine everywhere.
[12:46:22] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure why someone put that in.
[12:47:09] <scott_gonzalez> .ui-button has text-decoration: none !important;
[12:47:34] <scott_gonzalez> I wouldn't be surprised to see that break.
[12:48:06] <scott_gonzalez> All it takes is something like .wrapper a { text-decoration: ... }
[12:48:51] <raj> but isn't .ui-button more specific?
[12:48:52] <scott_gonzalez> I think I'm probably ok with that braeking in 1.9 though.
[12:48:55] <raj> than .wrapper
[12:49:12] <scott_gonzalez> Equally specific and likely loaded first.
[12:49:18] <scott_gonzalez> But it's less specific than .wrapper a
[12:49:28] <scott_gonzalez> Which is more likely to be used for text-decroation.
[12:49:28] <raj> ah
[12:49:37] <scott_gonzalez> The concern here is definitely $( "a" ).button()
[12:50:14] <raj> so then .css file would need a .ui-button a selector
[12:50:20] <raj> and all is well?
[12:50:59] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it'd need to be at whatever specificity the other `a` rules are at, but yes.
[12:53:13] <scott_gonzalez> There are two other uses of !important.
[12:53:20] <scott_gonzalez> .ui-state-disabled { cursor: default !important; }
[12:53:27] <scott_gonzalez> .ui-helper-hidden-accessible { position: absolute !important;
[12:53:31] <scott_gonzalez> Both actually seem reasonable.
[12:55:01] <robert_> so I'm working with jquery-validate (or, trying to anyway) and for some reason, it doesn't validate my input form.. http://test2.rudyvalencia.com/jquery-wizard.html
[12:55:27] <scott_gonzalez> raj: I'm sort of inclined to just land the tabs fix and leave it at that.
[12:55:41] <scott_gonzalez> I'm open to debate on the button rule, but the other two seem fine.
[12:56:07] <raj> hmm
[12:57:07] <scott_gonzalez> Do you at least agree on the .ui-state-disabled and .ui-helper-hidden-accessible cases?
[12:57:16] <scott_gonzalez> Those actually are important.
[12:58:44] <raj> but position isn't inherited
[12:59:08] <raj> so why would that necessarily need position:absolute !important; ?
[13:01:04] <lahwran> how do I undo or cancel a change() event?
[13:01:23] <ironfroggy> lahwran: like any event, return false;
[13:04:22] <scott_gonzalez> raj: Because if you have an element that has positioning from some other class, for example.
[13:04:33] <scott_gonzalez> raj: If it's accessible hidden, it MUST be hidden.
[13:04:58] <scott_gonzalez> raj: Do you have a reason that !important is problematic there?
[13:05:14] <scott_gonzalez> raj: If the argument is "!important is bad" then I can't get on board with it.
[13:06:09] <raj> well, original issue was having to put !important in places to override things that would commonly have to be overriden...
[13:06:29] <raj> then I just began thinking about how it could be avoided in totality
[13:07:33] <scott_gonzalez> raj: Yeah, the sane things, like tabs, make sense.
[13:07:55] <raj> agreed
[13:08:14] <scott_gonzalez> Like I said, I'm on the fence about button.
[13:08:23] <FernandoBasso> Can I make .mask() show dd/mm/yyyy?
[13:08:24] <raj> I haven't dabbled with each use of !important though, but even in the psat I've realized it was there and didn't need to be
[13:08:36] <raj> (besides tab)
[13:09:22] <raj> scott_gonzalez, I also realize that w3 isn't validating the css file
[13:10:04] <scott_gonzalez> Well, you can validate it. But we don't care about passing CSS validation.
[13:10:25] <raj> lol
[13:10:27] <raj> why's that?
[13:10:27] <scott_gonzalez> CSS validation is a joke because it's impractical to use valid CSS in production and support all browsers.
[13:10:37] <raj> ah, I see
[13:11:07] <raj> oh ok, I see what you mean
[13:12:04] <scott_gonzalez> FWIW, We are working toward validating our CSS, but we'll ignore specific errors.
[13:12:25] <scott_gonzalez> We already have a build task that does the validation, but we're not using it yet.
[13:12:26] <raj> gotcha
[13:12:35] <scott_gonzalez> We're already validation our JS + HTML.
[13:12:46] <raj> i notice that normalize.css and bootstrap.css don't validate either
[13:12:48] <scott_gonzalez> s/validation/validating/
[13:13:16] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing validates :-P Cross-browser CSS is insanity...
[13:14:48] <Surrealis> I am clone a table row via: var clone = $('#new').clone(true, true);
[13:14:58] <Surrealis> then making changes on the clone object
[13:15:16] <Surrealis> despite, setting deep copy to true and data to true. none of the event are moving over
[13:16:04] <Surrealis> any idea?
[13:16:24] <Surrealis> i have seen that the select values will not carry over by design, but the events "should"
[13:16:52] <scott_gonzalez> raj: What's your thought on button? Do you think more users will need to add an underline or more people will need to remove an underline?
[13:16:57] <johnkpaul> Surrealis: the events are added originally using jquery?
[13:17:12] <scott_gonzalez> raj: My guess is almost everyone wants it removed when anchors are styled as buttons.
[13:17:18] <raj> I like having underlines, fwiw
[13:17:24] <raj> but that's just me
[13:17:26] <scott_gonzalez> in buttons?
[13:17:53] <Surrealis> yes indeed they are
[13:17:56] <raj> even still, I think people should just make little css changes, rather than having to override an !important property
[13:18:31] <Surrealis> i am using $('#totals').before(clone); to add the clone
[13:18:41] <jedimind> css validation should really be used as a tool to catch any glaring and obvious fuck ups
[13:20:02] <johnkpaul> Surrealis: do you have a live demo? if not, can you jsfiddle/pastebin the code?
[13:20:15] <scott_gonzalez> raj: I'm on board with changing .ui-button. I'm going to take it to the rest of the team first though.
[13:20:27] <Surrealis> John, no not yet. i'm working on that right now
[13:20:39] <Surrealis> thought i would ask to see if i was missing something obvious
[13:20:42] <raj> cool, scott_gonzalez, I'm really impressed that you took this on immediately
[13:20:50] <raj> pretty awesome
[13:21:10] <scott_gonzalez> raj: I don't like !important either :-)
[13:21:19] <raj> :)
[13:21:31] <scott_gonzalez> There are the two uses cases that are sane. The button I'm only on the fence about because it's a potentially breaking change.
[13:21:44] <scott_gonzalez> Albeit an easy change to overcome.
[13:21:58] <johnkpaul> Surrealis: no, nothing obvious, $jqObj.clone(true,true) should do what you expect it to do
[13:23:39] <raj> agreed
[13:24:34] <scott_gonzalez> I'm gonna go ahead and make the change and see if any of our demos or visual tests are affected. I'm still waiting to hear back from the rest of the team.
[13:25:04] <raj> cool scott_gonzalez, I'm looking forward to 1.9
[13:28:50] <jedimind> 1.9 what?
[13:29:14] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery UI 1.9
[13:31:59] <aolko> hello
[13:32:07] <aolko> help me anyone, please
[13:32:47] <AcademyIntl> Hey there!  Probably asked a lot, but it's bugging the % out of me.  Basically, all my javascript seems to be firing asynchronously, which is a BIG PROBLEM for what I'm trying to do.  I have an image gallery, and at page load the gallery loads the first page of the specified category, then it should load the first picture on that page in the large view; but both the load image and load page calls are happening at the same time, loadIm
[13:32:55] <AcademyIntl> .. the page data itself hasn't even loaded.
[13:33:03] <NoiseEee> AcademyIntl: you had me laughing at "seems to be firing asynchronously"
[13:33:09] <NoiseEee> that is the essence of the language dude
[13:33:16] <johnkpaul> where's bot-t
[13:33:18] <johnkpaul> I need !ajax101
[13:33:19] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: Not when I'm using completion callbacks...
[13:33:33] <Koganei> yeah I was gonna say that
[13:33:39] <scott_gonzalez> raj: So apparently that was to combat pseudo classes, which makes more sense than combatting high-specificifity selectors.
[13:33:42] <johnkpaul> !ajax101
[13:33:44] <johnkpaul> ?ajax101
[13:33:45] <bot-t> Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[13:33:48] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: loadImage is supposed to be called when loadPage completes.. using a completion callback.
[13:33:53] <scott_gonzalez> So I'm going to add rules for .ui-button:hover, etc.
[13:34:22] <raj> aah
[13:34:34] <raj> must have been a temporary fix during development that got overlooked for production release
[13:34:38] <NoiseEee> AcademyIntl: make a jsfiddle and someone will likely help you out
[13:34:59] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: Yeah, I'm trying to do that now, but it's a lot of code.  Trying to get the parts that are related to this problem only.
[13:35:16] <NoiseEee> AcademyIntl: beauty, that usually helps you solve it yourself :)
[13:35:42] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: Oh, which leads me to also ask; how do I pass a dynamic callback (this would make this whole problem.. not exist.)
[13:36:14] <AcademyIntl> ie: myFunction('arg1', 'arg2').onComplete(myCompletionFunction);  (obviously not like that, but you get the point.)  How would I do that?
[13:36:16] <scott_gonzalez> raj: That's entirely possible.
[13:36:30] <NoiseEee> im not sure what you are referring to by 'dynamic callback'
[13:37:19] <NoiseEee> AcademyIntl: something like that, usually you put it in an anonymous function.    <etc>.onComplete(function() { yourFunctionName(); })
[13:37:30] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: Basically, foo('bar')   function foo(callback){  /* foo code here */ exec(callback); return; }  function bar(){ alert('foo completed!'); }
[13:37:52] <nDuff> Is there a way to prevent jQuery.ajax() from following redirects?
[13:37:59] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: That's the thing though, a function call can have an onComplete ?  foo('arg1').onComplete(function(){}}) would work?
[13:38:01] * nDuff wants to treat any 302 received as an error case.
[13:38:12] <NoiseEee> AcademyIntl: no, a function does not have an oncomplete
[13:38:27] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: Yeah, so how do I do it then?  :/
[13:38:30] <aolko> http://imm.io/sBK4 how do i pass data from this form to jquery notification script?
[13:39:11] <scott_gonzalez> raj: http://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/HEAD
[13:39:12] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by Scott González (31.96s ago): Theme: Remove !important from tabs and button styles. Fixes #8396 - Use of !important in jquery-ui.css should be avoided.
[13:40:11] <NoiseEee> AcademyIntl:   basically you take code that looks like:  functionA();  functionB();   and turn it into:  functionA();   where:  function functionA() { //do stuff; functionB(); }
[13:40:28] <AcademyIntl> I swear to ### if I just made this happen myself... wow.....
[13:40:29] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: http://jsfiddle.net/HrhWE/1/
[13:40:32] <NoiseEee> AcademyIntl: you break up your code and use callbacks.  google should have plenty of examples
[13:40:37] <AcademyIntl> Is that even proper?  Because it SEEMS to work :/
[13:41:15] <NoiseEee> sure
[13:41:25] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: In my browser, that seems to work.  Foo is called , I see "foo", then bar is called and I see "foo completed"
[13:41:42] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: If that's proper... then I can make my loadImage a callback of loadPage.
[13:41:44] <NoiseEee> right, which is different than just  foo(); bar();
[13:41:57] <NoiseEee> AcademyIntl: now you're getting it
[13:42:02] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: The only problem here is, how would I pass arguments to the callback ?
[13:42:11] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: function foo(callback, args) ?
[13:42:25] <evasivx> Hey gang, quick question. What would you call this style of image slider? I'm looking for a standalone jquery one that achieves this (this one is joomla based only) http://realway2lose.com/
[13:42:35] <NoiseEee> AcademyIntl: sure...
[13:42:36] <raj> great scott_gonzalez, thanks :)
[13:43:21] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: I'm facepalming at the moment... This is why I don't ECMAscript is because I honestly can't understand half the things that happen in it.  if I tried to do foo(bar); in PHP the thing would just scream at me.. here it works?  It's all backwards in my head :(
[13:43:26] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: Thanks for your time.
[13:43:45] <NoiseEee> AcademyIntl: np good luck
[13:44:05] <scott_gonzalez> AcademyIntl: PHP has anonymous functions and high order functions.
[13:44:29] <scott_gonzalez> s/high/higher/
[13:44:53] <AcademyIntl> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, was just an example of why I can't figure out some things here, backwards thinking to what I'm used to.
[13:45:52] <AcademyIntl> Okay, I have one issue now then.
[13:45:55] <nDuff> AcademyIntl: There are languages more conducive to static checking (and generally less conducive to magic syntax) that can compile down to JavaScript if that would be easier -- GWT, ClojureScript, ...
[13:46:20] <AcademyIntl> $('#thing') will resolve "id=thing" immediately upon execution, what if I only want it to be resolved when the callback is called?  How would I emulate this?
[13:46:27] <evasivx> -____- okay
[13:46:44] <NoiseEee> AcademyIntl: ... put it in the callback?
[13:46:47] <gweedo767> ok, so I am trying to hide a bunch of div's unless they are one of a few classes
[13:47:16] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: Yes, but if I do foo(bar, $('#thing')); the args will be "null" since it's not been created yet (foo creates it).
[13:47:22] <gweedo767> I am trying: $(".item:not(.consoles):not(.sidetables)").fadeOut();
[13:47:37] <gweedo767> all the divs are in the "item" class and then have another class that lets me know what category they are
[13:47:41] <gweedo767> any reason that wouldn't work?
[13:48:00] <NoiseEee> AcademyIntl: foo(bar,'thing') { //now get 'var thing' to be $('#'+thing);
[13:49:40] <imachuchu> is there an easy way of triggering a function when an autocomplete window is closed but nothing is selected?
[13:49:52] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: Moment.. you may have given me an idea...
[13:52:06] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: Interesting error in firefox http://pastie.org/4082366  Can a function not consist of only optional arguments?
[13:54:18] <NoiseEee> AcademyIntl: it can, but not like that.   function loadPage(callback,args) { if (typeof callback=='undefined') {//callback wasn't sent to the function, use a default or whatevs}   }
[13:54:53] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: :/  then wtf is this:  http://www.openjs.com/articles/optional_function_arguments.php ?  :(  CONFUSION
[13:55:44] <NoiseEee> AcademyIntl: what about it?
[13:56:00] <johnkpaul> AcademyIntl: that post doesn't say that you can use PHP-like default arguments
[13:56:04] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: It shows function foo(bar = default) .. etc
[13:56:17] <NoiseEee> AcademyIntl: uhh where
[13:56:32] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: *facepalm* I was looking at the PHP example and thinking that was JS -_-  FFFFF
[13:56:33] <NoiseEee> AcademyIntl: their function war is similar, but not as safe as what i typed above
[13:56:33] <johnkpaul> that first example is PHP
[13:56:49] <AcademyIntl> johnkpaul: Ugh, yeah I just noticed that.
[13:56:49] <zoster> is there anyone from argentina here?
[13:56:50] <vandunk> Can anyone recommend a really lightweight/good jquery overlay plugin?
[13:57:48] <zoster> $('div#overlay').css('opacity', 0.5);
[13:58:07] <zoster> set your #overlay, height: 100%;, width: 100%;, position: absolute;
[13:58:14] <zoster> left:0; top: 0px;
[13:58:16] <johnkpaul> vandunk: how lightweight? fancybox does almost everything that you'd ever need and it's 20k pregzip
[13:58:18] <gweedo767> nevermind my question, it worked :)
[13:58:20] <zoster> that should do
[13:58:23] <vandunk> Yeah, good idea.
[13:58:39] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: Alright, works great; but the image isn't being loaded; and no errors are thrown.
[13:58:40] <vandunk> What are the advantages of something like fancybox over using what zoster has just said?
[13:58:57] <johnkpaul> vandunk: if that's all you need, then absolutely nothing
[13:58:57] <vandunk> Easier customization?
[13:59:07] <johnkpaul> fancybox has many many more options for customizaton
[13:59:11] <vandunk> Okay
[13:59:14] <NoiseEee> AcademyIntl: jsfiddle dude, the channel's crystal ball is brokened
[13:59:29] <johnkpaul> take a look at the docs, if all you need is a translucent overlay, do what zoster said
[13:59:59] <vandunk> It will just be text, maybe an image and a google map
[14:00:12] <vandunk> not sure if I'll need the preload or not.
[14:00:20] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: Yeah, jsFiddle is great for snippets, but I can't exactly copy-paste the entire page into it, esp. when it relies on ajax returns (which jsFiddle only returns dummy values for.)
[14:01:14] <NoiseEee> well http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 might help you out AcademyIntl
[14:01:33] <NoiseEee> start to debug, or supply jsfiddle with what you know to be the xhr response
[14:02:43] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: Yeah, I am using FireBug / "Developer Toolkit" (now builtin to Firefox.)
[14:04:17] <Brodingo> caniuse hsla
[14:04:39] <Brodingo> >:|
[14:07:25] <AcademyIntl> NoiseEee: Right, now it makes no sense.  Page is loaded, loadPage is being called like 10 times (as identified by console.log('loadImage Callback Fired!') ... even though it's only called once in the jQuery entry point.  I can't seem to find out where else it's being called either, as the only other places the function is even mentioned is when I call it through click(function() { ... }) on the images themselves.
[14:07:36] <AcademyIntl> Last I checked anonymous onClick functions weren't called on pageload, so what's up -_-
[14:09:17] <AcademyIntl> Oh and, the ultimate fun:  FireBug isn't breaking on debugger;   It's just ignoring it.
[14:10:20] <NoiseEee> AcademyIntl: at this point its impossible to help without seeing some code... i'm off but hopefully someone else can help. good luck, you'll get it
[14:10:59] <AcademyIntl> I'd hope so, but when IE's F12 and FireBug are ignoring breakpoints... how can I even debug -_-
[14:11:36] <systemfault> AcademyIntl, add a debugger;  statement o_O
[14:11:41] <zamba> hi there, i'm looking for a simple way of making a div sticky on the page.. meaning when i scroll, that div stays put
[14:11:52] <pifantastic> css position: fixed @ zamba
[14:12:03] <pifantastic> AcademyIntl: can you link to the site?
[14:12:06] <AcademyIntl> systemfault: I have a debugger; statement, IE and FF are ignoring them.
[14:12:17] <pifantastic> AcademyIntl: is chrome?
[14:12:18] <AcademyIntl> pifantastic: YES  I can!  http://blazehomes.com/gallery.php?from=bathroom
[14:12:25] <AcademyIntl> pifantastic: I don't have Chrome.    :P
[14:12:38] <zamba> pifantastic: hm?
[14:12:44] <zamba> pifantastic: oh
[14:14:24] <AcademyIntl> Great, I've got the debugger to finally load up (had to go for Opera to do it.. sad.)  hits line callback($('#'+args).attr('rel')); and says "args="thumb3"" (as expected.)  callback is a function reference to loadImage ... yet when loadImage is called (one line later) url = undefined .   How's that possible?
[14:14:57] <AcademyIntl> Oh, and in console I run $('#thumb3').attr('rel'); at this breakpoint and it returns a valid URL...
[14:16:55] <AcademyIntl> gWow, I can't beleive it was somehting that stupid...
[14:17:17] <grifx> hi
[14:17:22] <systemfault> HAI
[14:17:26] <AcademyIntl> I had my rel on thumblink3 ... and the url on thumb3 .. I was accessing the rel of thumb3 (which didn't exist, but of course debugger didn't bother telling me that...)
[14:17:38] <grifx> I search a piece of code to launch a sound when i click on an element
[14:17:40] <AcademyIntl> I'm mad now :<
[14:17:49] <grifx> the simplest thing
[14:18:10] <AcademyIntl> Oh hey, grifx  I did that just this morning.. let me give you something...
[14:18:39] <grifx> AcademyIntl: thanks !
[14:18:41] <zackiv31> does jQuery have isMobile detection?  I'm not sure feature detection is adequate for my use case
[14:19:13] <zackiv31> i want to use hover effects on non-mobile and clicks on mobile
[14:21:52] <johnkpaul>  zackiv31 jquerymobile has "virtual mouse events"
[14:21:57] <johnkpaul> that you can use for something like taht
[14:23:32] <AcademyIntl> grifx: I don't know if it's something to do with loading restrictions on jsFiddle, but the code http://jsfiddle.net/8CbKh/2/ works on my pages; but not in the jsFiddle itself.
[14:23:49] <grifx> ah ok
[14:23:52] <grifx> AcademyIntl:  i try
[14:24:25] <AcademyIntl> Anyone here know if jsFiddle restricts loading externel things (sounds, etc?)  Or why code such as: http://jsfiddle.net/8CbKh/3/ wouldn't work inside jsFiddle but works on other pages?
[14:24:48] <grifx> AcademyIntl: what does .cloneNode(true) ?
[14:25:18] <AcademyIntl> grifx: It makes a copy of the sound, that automatically cleans itself up when it finishs playing.  Allows you to play multiple sounds at once this way, without making multiple audio tags.
[14:25:24] <grifx> there is three files... that will launch the 3 sound at the same time ?
[14:25:25] <johnkpaul> grifx: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Node.cloneNode
[14:25:32] <grifx> ah ok
[14:25:35] <zackiv31> yah i dont think i would want to even use jquery mobile.. its for an image zoom... i'd rather rely on the native applications click and pinch to zoom
[14:25:42] <AcademyIntl> grifx: No, they are different versions of the same sound.  Some browers do not understand other formats.
[14:25:58] <grifx> that will choose the good one
[14:25:59] <AcademyIntl> grifx: HTML5 Audio support is different per browser, some use wav only, some m4a, some ogg, some mp3.
[14:26:04] <grifx> ok
[14:26:09] <AcademyIntl> grifx: Yeah, browsers will choose which one they can play.
[14:26:24] <AcademyIntl> Still no idea why it doesn't work on jsFiddle.
[14:27:06] <grifx> cool
[14:27:14] <grifx> AcademyIntl: And do you have basic sound ?
[14:27:29] <Posterdati> hi
[14:27:40] <AcademyIntl> grifx: yeah, that pop is literally a "pop" sound (as seen on Facebook, etc.)  I use it for my sound test.
[14:28:05] <Posterdati> is svg.loadURL referring to an svg in the same document directory?
[14:28:14] <grifx> it's enaugh for my homework
[14:28:18] <grifx> AcademyIntl: thanks a lot
[14:29:40] <grifx> this.options[this.selectedIndex].value
[14:29:47] <EyePulp> I think the answer is "no", but does a break; work within a $.each() ?
[14:30:05] <grifx> what's options ?
[14:30:35] <johnkpaul> EyePulp: you can just return, it's a normal function
[14:30:35] <johnkpaul> I suppose that's more of a continue;, but you can keep returning
[14:31:07] <johnkpaul> EyePulp: you can return false to break
[14:31:09] <johnkpaul> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[14:31:27] <EyePulp> I totally read past that - sorry. =)
[14:37:29] <cantonic> hey guys. I am quite new to jquery. I saw in some tutorials people using bind(). Isn't it the same as on()?
[14:39:02] <laszlof> cantonic: .on can attach to multiple events and selectors.
[14:39:19] <cantonic> laszlof: and bind() only to one?
[14:39:45] <laszlof> i think so
[14:39:54] <laszlof> erm, maybe not
[14:39:57] <laszlof> i re-read the docs
[14:40:15] <systemfault> bind is the same as on
[14:40:17] <cantonic> laszlof: but instead of doing $("#foo").bind(click …) i could also do $("#foo").click(…)
[14:40:25] <laszlof> looks like .on is something new for 1.7, im not really sure what makes it any better than .bind
[14:40:30] <cantonic> so why is it even necessary to use those methods?
[14:40:43] <johnkpaul> .on is much more flexible
[14:40:43] <systemfault> laszlof, .on merges .bind and .delegate
[14:40:44] <cantonic> laszlof: on() is the new live() afaik
[14:41:04] <laszlof> cantonic: you may want to bind multiple events
[14:41:09] <johnkpaul> cantonic: it is the new live,delegate and bind
[14:41:11] <laszlof> .click only supports "click"
[14:41:25] <laszlof> if you're coding for mobile devices for example, you do not always want to use .click()
[14:41:26] <johnkpaul> laszlof: cantonic http://www.elijahmanor.com/2012/02/differences-between-jquery-bind-vs-live.html
[14:41:28] <cantonic> ah ok, got it
[14:41:47] <johnkpaul> that explains bind, live, and delegate vs on
[14:41:48] <cantonic> thank you guys. very helpful
[14:46:50] <alexwait> Heya jquery IRC. Got a weird issue. I'm seeing in my console that when printing a valid jQuery element, I'm not getting that nice pretty output of the dom element. Here's a summary: http://i.imgur.com/iMYGA.png
[14:47:59] <alexwait> This is quite random (about 1/10 calls to this method)
[14:48:03] <alexwait> the element isn't being removed from the dom
[14:48:05] <alexwait> or anything liek that
[14:48:24] <karbassi> alexwait: what's calling 'height'?
[14:48:46] <alexwait> the line right after children()
[14:49:06] <karbassi> which is?
[14:49:08] <alexwait> We're seeing lots of random queries failing. This one is just a good example
[14:49:10] <alexwait> which is?
[14:49:13] <alexwait> we'r edoing
[14:49:20] <alexwait> var test = floatBox.children('div')
[14:49:25] <alexwait> then test.height()
[14:49:27] <alexwait> immediately after
[14:49:49] <alexwait> No jquery supported methods work on this element
[14:50:11] <alexwait> I'm curious what is the magic that happens between that return in pushStack and us actually using the jquery object as aj query object
[14:50:15] <alexwait> something is obviosuly happening
[14:50:22] <alexwait> if I put a setTimeout after teh jquery callt o delay execution
[14:50:25] <karbassi> alexwait: write a quick if statement checking that `test` exists and it's a jquery object.
[14:50:32] <alexwait> the error never occurs if the timeout is large enough (say 2 seconds)
[14:50:37] <alexwait> we can't do that :\
[14:50:47] <alexwait> do that to all of our hundreds of jquery statements?
[14:50:50] <alexwait> It's valid 90% of the time
[14:50:58] <alexwait> and what do we do if it isnt'?
[14:50:59] <karbassi> what's the timeout do?
[14:51:04] <alexwait> further calls to jQuery fail
[14:51:05] <danzik17> alexwait: can you reproduce this on jsfiddle?
[14:51:10] <alexwait> the timeout calls .height()
[14:51:15] <alexwait> I cannot I've been trying for DAYS
[14:51:17] <alexwait> to come up with something
[14:51:18] <alexwait> http://jsfiddle.net/bobber205/97geu/21/
[14:51:27] <alexwait> is the closest to what we're doing but there's no errors
[14:51:42] <alexwait> I know a repo case for you guys to fiddle iwth is the best and I've really honestly tried
[14:51:48] <alexwait> but it's simply not done/possible
[14:51:55] <alexwait> This is a fairly large and complex page so that may play into it
[14:52:00] <karbassi> alexwait: can you post the original code with the timeout?
[14:52:01] <alexwait> I just want ot know where jQuery could be failing
[14:52:27] <alexwait>     var test = floatBox.children('div');
[14:52:27] <alexwait>     setTimeout(function() {
[14:52:27] <alexwait>         console.log(floatBox);
[14:52:27] <alexwait>         console.log(test);
[14:52:27] <alexwait>         test
[14:52:27] <alexwait>         .height(floatBox.height())
[14:52:27] <alexwait>         .width(floatBox.width())
[14:52:28] <danzik17> alexwait: sounds like something else in your code is interacting oddly with jQuery then then.  it's not jQuery that's failing tbh.  can you reproduce this every time in your code?
[14:52:28] <alexwait>         .css({top: 0, left: 0});
[14:52:28] <alexwait>     }, 2000);
[14:52:32] <karbassi> omg, not here
[14:52:37] <alexwait> only about 90% of the time
[14:52:49] <alexwait> http://pastebin.com/MGU4qGpU
[14:52:54] <alexwait> err
[14:52:58] <karbassi> alexwait: looks like a scoping problem
[14:52:58] <alexwait> I meant only 10% of the time
[14:53:01] <alexwait> it seems super random
[14:53:04] <alexwait> it isn't a scoping problem
[14:53:11] <alexwait> we're int eh same exact scope constantly
[14:53:15] <alexwait> it's literally one line after another
[14:53:44] <karbassi> alexwait: well, if your code is in a function (let's call it A). If A gets called more than once, then `test` is set multiple times.
[14:53:52] <danzik17> alexwait: fine, that means you can reproduce it right now then in theory.  before you call .height, do console.log( obj.prototype, typeof obj.prototype.jquery, obj instanceof jQuery.fn.init )
[14:54:09] <alexwait> k
[14:54:10] <alexwait> will do
[14:55:23] <alexwait> I am getting test.prototype.jQuery is undefined
[14:55:35] <alexwait> do you only want me to print that in the error case?
[14:55:41] <veganista> whats the recommended temaplating method? is it tmpl?
[14:55:42] <danzik17> lowercase jquery
[14:55:52] <alexwait> kk
[14:55:55] <alexwait> I tried that too :P
[14:55:58] <alexwait> so just error case only?
[14:56:08] <danzik17> sure
[14:57:35] <alexwait> fyi: This is Chrome 18+ ONLY
[14:58:04] <alexwait> danzik17: I am trying ther lowercase on error case on ly for jquery
[14:58:05] <alexwait> it isays
[14:58:11] <alexwait> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'jquery' of undefined
[14:58:56] <danzik17> alexwait: ah wait /facepalm - this isn't a constructor function, doesn't have the prototype property.
[14:59:05] <danzik17> just do the last test - obj instanceof jQuery.fn.init
[14:59:11] <alexwait> kk
[14:59:11] <alexwait> hehe
[14:59:12] <danzik17> serves the same purpose
[14:59:25] <alexwait> no worries! :D
[14:59:28] <vpv4oo> how do you separate jquery code from ordinary JS code? my jQuery animation code is inside $(function(){ ... }); where do i place functions that have not got any jQuery related code in them?
[15:00:32] <nFFF> alexwait, is the content of flaotbox loaded dynamically?
[15:00:33] <alexwait> ok it says "false"
[15:00:34] <alexwait> for that check
[15:00:36] <alexwait> it is not
[15:00:42] <alexwait> it is static div on page
[15:00:47] <alexwait> that selector is called once per page load
[15:00:51] <alexwait> so each time I click it is valid object
[15:01:08] <vpv4oo> i tried placing them before just outside of $(function() ... but for a reason unknown to me it doesnt work
[15:01:12] <Posterdati> hi
[15:01:14] <nFFF> console.log(test) produces a valid object?
[15:01:16] <alexwait> the weird "temporary" object in my screenshot (http://i.imgur.com/iMYGA.png) find sthe div
[15:01:20] <alexwait> yes
[15:01:20] <Posterdati> how can I install jquery svg plugin?
[15:01:23] <alexwait> take a look at http://i.imgur.com/iMYGA.png
[15:01:44] <alexwait> 3rd image in that link
[15:01:52] <alexwait> teh "sweet. that looks good". I am printing the object there
[15:02:01] <alexwait> the one w/o .height() or any other jquery supported method
[15:02:11] <danzik17> alexwait: right, and since this only happens in chrome, is something messing with the __proto__  property somewhere?  basically, something is setting this object's prototype to not be jQuery.prototype
[15:02:29] <alexwait> hmm
[15:02:30] <alexwait> maybe it is
[15:02:31] <nFFF> oh this only happens in chrome?
[15:02:38] <alexwait> why would a setTimeout make this happen less?
[15:02:45] <alexwait> I did a 2 second timeout before calling .height()
[15:02:51] <alexwait> and I wasn't able to repo after probably 100t ries
[15:03:03] <alexwait> yes. it only happens in chrome 18+
[15:03:07] <alexwait> windows only
[15:03:15] <alexwait> the mac version had an update last week that seems to have fixed it xD
[15:03:24] <alexwait> I looked at the changelogs as best I could and didn't see anything relevant
[15:03:27] <danzik17> alexwait: no idea, we don't know your codebase.  but a settimeout re-organizes the call stack.  you can probably get the same effect with a setTimeout( fn, 0 )
[15:03:37] <grifx> someone give me a script
[15:03:37] <alexwait> yes. I did with a 0 timeout
[15:03:38] <grifx> :
[15:03:45] <alexwait> not 100% reduction in errors but alot
[15:03:52] <grifx> <audio id="msgBeep" preload>
[15:03:56] <grifx> it's normal ???
[15:04:01] <grifx> preload is html5 ?
[15:04:04] <alexwait> I've shown what is probably all the code base you'd hopefully needt o say
[15:04:16] <alexwait> the example is isolated purrely to the code you see
[15:04:24] <alexwait> unless it's the actual DOM elements it's traversing
[15:06:43] <grifx> <audio id="msgBeep" preload> is correct html5 ?
[15:06:53] <danzik17> alexwait: well, even in your stacktrace, you've got the clickhandler and then 3 additional function calls before it errors out.  we don't know all of the code in any of those functions.  it's probably somewhere in there though.
[15:07:47] <alexwait> I think you are reading that stack trace backwards :P
[15:08:04] <alexwait> the error occurs in resizeIFrameShim()
[15:08:08] <alexwait> which now only consists of my testing code
[15:08:19] <alexwait> the other functions I've taken out all DOM related operations
[15:08:22] <alexwait> to isolate this one call
[15:08:31] <alexwait> the .children() call
[15:08:57] <alexwait> This is happening in about 50 or so random spots
[15:09:02] <alexwait> each spot we have a jQuery call
[15:09:03] <alexwait> what's more funny
[15:09:07] <alexwait> is that after this happens once
[15:09:12] <alexwait> every single other jQuery call fails
[15:09:14] <alexwait> in that same way
[15:09:18] <alexwait> you don't get a valid jQuery object :\
[15:13:57] <Posterdati> how can I install jquery svg plugin?
[15:14:19] <nobitanobi1> I am using: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker — and when I set disable:true, it disables the input but not the image calendar. I can still click on the image calendar and select a date.  Any thoughts on how to disable the image calendar?
[15:14:24] <danzik17> alexwait: so something in your codebase is breaking jQuery then.  could be a plugin, something messing improperly with jQuery.fn, maybe something modifying Object.prototype, dunno.
[15:15:23] <laszlof> nobitanobi1: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/disabled-datepicker
[15:15:26] <grifx> 	$('#ligne').click(ligneClic);
[15:15:33] <grifx> i want to playSound();
[15:15:35] <grifx> on click
[15:16:29] <grifx> 	$('#ligne').click(ligneClic, function(){playSound()});
[15:16:32] <grifx> not works
[15:16:44] <nobitanobi1> laszlof: I think that tackles another problem?
[15:17:09] <laszlof> nobitanobi1: it tells you how to disable the datepicker
[15:18:10] <nobitanobi1> I know how to disable the datepicker, the problem is that when clicking on the button it stills shows the calendar
[15:18:15] <nobitanobi1> even though the input is disabled.
[15:18:32] <laszlof> you havent read the solution provided
[15:18:49] <laszlof> 4th reply
[15:19:31] <nobitanobi1> laszlof: what is this supposed to do? $('#mydate').datepicker().datepicker('disable'); ??
[15:20:58] <laszlof> nobitanobi1: it disables the datapicker
[15:21:10] <laszlof> or close to, its not exactly correct
[15:21:14] <laszlof> http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[15:21:30] <imsky> .
[15:22:07] <nobitanobi1> laszlof: in the official docs, it just tells you how to disable the datepicker but not how to disable the buttonImage.
[15:22:16] <nobitanobi1> which is by setting the booleana ttribute disabled
[15:23:56] <nobitanobi1> anyway, i am goign to try to play with it.
[15:23:59] <nobitanobi1> thanks laszlof
[15:28:57] <sunbeam> $("#main_navigation > li")
[15:29:05] <sunbeam> this means the first li within main_navigation right?
[15:30:26] <imsky> no
[15:30:37] <imsky> it means the li's that are direct children of main_navigation
[15:31:38] <sunbeam> ok
[15:31:50] <sunbeam> the first line li's
[15:37:03] <shoky> Posterdati: you just include the .js and .css
[15:37:53] <Posterdati> shoky: .js but not the css :)
[15:38:19] <shoky> Posterdati: ..ok
[15:39:15] <Posterdati> I did
[15:39:26] <shoky> installation complete
[15:39:33] <Posterdati> ok
[15:39:43] <shoky> joy joy joy
[15:39:46] <Posterdati> now I'd like to add onclick on an svg
[15:40:01] <shoky> go for it
[15:40:10] <Posterdati> I've got mouseover and mouseout in the svg
[15:40:19] <Posterdati> how can I add onclick?
[15:40:25] <shoky> i showed you this yesterday..
[15:40:35] <Posterdati> didn't work
[15:40:44] <shoky> sure it did.. http://jsfiddle.net/AAHcn/
[15:41:30] <Posterdati> shoky: thanks
[15:42:07] <shoky> np
[15:42:28] <Posterdati> my svg is loaded from a file
[15:43:02] <shoky> so's your html and javascript
[15:45:53] <Posterdati> shoky: http://pastebin.com/qc4eRG3r
[15:46:44] <Posterdati> shoky: http://pastebin.com/aXyTnD59
[15:46:50] <shoky> no idea about <embed>s with svg..
[15:52:18] <Posterdati> shoky: the map is not important, points is the loaded svg with click
[15:53:16] <shoky> Posterdati: the answer here shows how to use jquery-svg with <embed> tag: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8443292/select-svg-width-using-jquery
[15:53:37] <shoky> i have not tried it myself, good luck.
[15:54:50] <Posterdati> shoky: I don't need to embed svg, but I need to add click to a loaded svg shape
[15:55:26] <henn1nk> does someone usw bootstrap? i don't know what i am doing wrong with the tab script :( ... i added data-toggle="tab" and class nav and nav-tabs ..but the .tab-content > .tab-pane isn't displayed :(
[15:56:18] <shoky> Posterdati: go for it
[15:56:51] <Posterdati>       var svg = $( "#points" ).svg({ loadURL: 'points.svg' });
[15:56:52] <Posterdati>       svg.attr("onclick", function() { alert("Ciao"); });
[15:57:01] <Posterdati> didn't work
[15:57:38] <shoky> did the first line work.
[15:58:01] <shoky> is that how you're supposed to use it?
[15:58:11] <Posterdati> yes, point get loaded and displayed with the mouseover and mouseout event handling
[15:59:12] <shoky> ok
[15:59:26] <shoky> did you read how to use jquery-svg ?
[15:59:32] <Posterdati> shoky: the alert is displayed at the page loading
[16:00:04] <Posterdati> I read http://keith-wood.name/svg.html
[16:00:43] <shoky> and where did you see that you're supposed to .attr("onclick"...  ?
[16:01:04] <Posterdati> on another example :)
[16:01:19] <shoky> which
[16:01:23] <Posterdati> the example in the link I posted didn't work for me
[16:02:21] <shoky> which example..
[16:05:19] <Posterdati> shoky: ok, I solved
[16:05:25] <Posterdati> shoky: thanks to you!
[16:05:36] <shoky> ;]
[16:07:23] <Posterdati> shoky: would you like to see the code?
[16:09:07] <shoky> i donno, would i? ;p
[16:09:42] <shoky> actually i have to go for a bit, so maybe later ;P

[16:24:27] <tinix> can someone help me with something?
[16:28:08] <zoster> we could
[16:28:16] <zoster> if you tell us what's it about
[16:28:23] <tinix> sure
[16:28:40] <tinix> i'm trying to convert some input fields to json
[16:28:43] <tinix> http://jsfiddle.net/Ar68d/
[16:28:46] <tinix> and getting nulls
[16:28:51] <tinix> and can't figure out where they are coming from
[16:29:01] <tinix> javascript isn't my strong suit
[16:29:34] <zoster> what do you want to accomplish excatly?
[16:29:38] <cgiGeek> morning ish

[17:08:06] <shoky> Eviltwin: that's cute, but why no worky on chromey :<
[17:08:30] <sx2020> flip_digits not a book but maybe codecademy?
[17:08:58] <Eviltwin> shoky: I didn't make it
[17:09:49] <flip_digits> sx2020 thanks I didn't even consider that
[17:10:38] <shoky> Eviltwin k
[17:12:08] <flip_digits> sx2020 I would still love a good book though : )
[17:16:39] <systemfault> jQuery books are obsolete the day they're published.. :/
[17:16:48] <sx2020> flip_digits this also on my bookmarks list https://developer.mozilla.org/en/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript
[17:21:31] <poppiez> any way to check for legacy android devices?
[17:23:42] <sx2020> poppiez you could use something like modernizr
[17:28:00] <poppiez> sx2020: it feature detects, which is fine. but what can I feature detect for that is true for legacy android?
[17:28:40] <sx2020> what is your definition of "legacy android"?

[17:37:10] <systemfault> Most android are legacy :/
[17:57:34] <Jon47> "legacy android" isn't a feature, so if you test for that, it's not a feature test, it's user agent sniffing, sometimes necessary but never the most elegant solution

[18:59:26] <snowfox> Can anyone think of a query cycle plugin that does "next" "prev" pagination and does "x of 20"?
[18:59:37] <snowfox> or "x of y"
[19:00:54] <TomWij> By the time you've found one, you could write one yourself I think. Pagination is rather simple...
[19:01:53] <TomWij> An integer, two links to (de|in)crement it, a limit. and then don't show one of the link at begin and end.
[19:02:44] <snowfox> but but, I don't want to write my own :P
[19:03:12] <snowfox> but, I may have to. I am not finding on that does both...hm
[19:03:12] <sample> hello there im still new in jquery how can i show to image alternately ?
[19:03:14] <snowfox> but, I may have to. I am not finding on that does both…hm
[19:03:49] <TomWij> snowfox: It's called pagination (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagination), here is an example plugin: http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/pagination
[19:04:11] <TomWij> If you throw jQuery Pagination into Google there are a lot of others;
[19:04:19] <snowfox> "show to image alternately"? sample
[19:05:14] <TomWij> sample: http://slodive.com/freebies/best-jquery-slideshow-gallery-plugins/
[19:05:29] <sample> this is the scenario if i click an image it will change to another image and if i click that image it will turn back to previous image
[19:05:51] <TomWij> Oh
[19:07:25] <sample> it's like a check box but im using an image like a blank checkbox if i click that image it will turn to a checked checkbox image and vice versa
[19:08:17] <donkeycongo> Somebody who knows an alternative to .elastic() (dynamic textarea)?
[19:08:25] <ScottG> When I get an ajax response it's .text() method returns a string escaped of html. How do I unescape it?
[19:09:21] <TomWij> sample: $('#myImage').click(function() { if $('#myImage').hasClass('second') { $('#myImage').attr('src','linkToFirst'); } else { $('#myImage').attr('src','linkToSecond'); } $('#myImage').toggleClass('second'); });
[19:10:18] <sample>  Tomwij: thanks buddy
[19:10:43] <TomWij> Note that I used toggleClass so I don't have to put addClass and removeClass inside the if.
[19:10:47] <ScottG> nvm, figured it out.
[19:11:26] <TomWij> ScottG: I'm guessing your server is sending it like that... :D
[19:12:16] <shoky> sample: well you already got an answer, but i've made a different answer, with kitties. so here:  http://jsfiddle.net/Wvqx3/
[19:14:31] <TomWij> shoky: Oh, pre-loading. :D
[19:15:01] <shoky> but mostly kitties!
[19:15:53] <TomWij> shoky: Now build me http://www.pointerpointer.com/ but then with kitties. :D
[19:15:53] <binaryfus10nz> how are the ninjas doing ?
[19:16:39] <shoky> TomWij: ;) sounds like a plan
[19:17:49] <saintvinasse> Hello there! I'm new to jQuery, and I'd need a hint: I need to stop this function on hover: http://pastebin.com/pcJm66C0
[19:18:12] <saintvinasse> and I don't see how to use the .stop()
[19:19:23] <danzik171> saintvinasse: stop what, the timer, or the animation?
[19:19:31] <saintvinasse> the timer
[19:19:45] <shoky> saintvinasse: best to use setTimeout instead of setInterval. but anyway you can clear it with clearInterval
[19:20:14] <shoky> actually
[19:20:16] <danzik171> you probably want to use setTimeout and save it to a var, not setInterval - then use a mouseenter event to call clearTimeout on that var
[19:20:39] <saintvinasse> you just crossed the chinese frontier to me ^^
[19:21:01] <saintvinasse> i get the part about clearinterval
[19:21:26] <saintvinasse> but I don't know anything about mouseenter
[19:21:33] <danzik171> saintvinasse: http://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/
[19:23:10] <saintvinasse> I see. I'm not sure I'll be able to do it with my bare hands and my little knowledge but I'll give it a try ;) thank you
[19:24:14] <shoky> saintvinasse, sec
[19:25:44] <saintvinasse> thank you shoky and danzik171 I think I might be able to understand with this SO as inspiration: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9244566/pause-function-on-element-hover
[19:26:04] <shoky> saintvinasse i'd do something like this http://pastebin.com/QNSADA4t
[19:26:22] <saintvinasse> cool! thank you shoky
[19:26:52] <shoky> or maybe better to just clear the timeout
[19:26:58] <shoky> donno why i did it with a flag
[19:28:17] <shoky> saintvinasse: http://pastebin.com/DQwxpkLU
[19:29:17] <saintvinasse> btw, any good course on jQuery to recommend? I'm very good in html/css but lack a lot in JS
[19:29:35] <saintvinasse> thank you! let me see and understand what you did

[19:30:06] <saintvinasse> oh nice
[19:30:15] <AcademyIntl> Hey there!  I have a chat program with rooms, I need the tab to somehow distinguish itself when a new message has been received.  Example: Meebo scrolls the page title to show a new message between "Meebo!"  "New Message!" and who the message is from (changing once every second) until you focus the tab again.
[19:30:30] <saintvinasse> thanks ;)
[19:31:57] <shoky> AcademyIntl: make a jsfiddle plz
[19:32:09] <AcademyIntl> shoky: Fiddle of what?
[19:32:34] <shoky> of a demonstration of whatever your unspecified issue is
[19:33:16] <AcademyIntl> shoky: There's no issue, I'm asking for opinions on how to make a tab in a browser (while onfocused) grab the user's attention.
[19:33:25] <shoky> now you're asking ;P
[19:34:11] <shoky> anyway its hard to understand what you mean, so i repeat, jsfiddle plz
[19:34:21] <shoky> er
[19:34:30] <shoky> well its hard to understand what you said before
[19:34:46] <shoky> oh you mean the browser tab
[19:35:04] <shoky> who says the browser has a tab?
[19:35:14] <AcademyIntl> shoky: -_-   1. "new message appears" but user is on another tab (say Wikipedia.)  How do I make my page tell them "HEY, NEW MESSAGE".  I know a few options are an Alert (obnoxious)  Sound (only works in some browsers), etc.
[19:35:22] <AcademyIntl> Another tab, window, etc.
[19:36:22] <AcademyIntl> shoky: Basically, right now I have it play a sound; but users have multiple tabs open and can't figure out which one has a new message.
[19:36:49] <shoky> yes, i like it that way
[19:37:12] <shoky> don't want no sites highlighting my browser UI
[19:37:25] <AcademyIntl> shoky: Problem is, if they have 3 rooms open for example. *pop*  "Wait, which one made the sound?" *has to go to each room and check which has a new message.*
[19:37:34] <shoky> anyway you can change the title
[19:37:50] <saintvinasse> shoky: your first code is working great, thank you
[19:37:51] <shoky> yeah , sounds suck too of course
[19:37:55] <shoky> saintvinasse np
[19:38:12] <AcademyIntl> shoky: Is there a jQuery callback for that, or just plain JS?
[19:38:21] <sebastian_o|> hey guys
[19:39:19] <shoky> AcademyIntl: for what, changing the title?
[19:39:24] <sebastian_o|> about autocomplete, how you guys handle the situation of doing something when it yields 0 results?
[19:39:50] <AcademyIntl> shoky: More like for managing it, or would I just go write my own with setTimeout and such?
[19:40:07] <sebastian_o|> the autocomplete menu isn't opening when there are no matches (but it would be great to have an event for that or something)
[19:40:41] <sebastian_o|> suggestions?
[19:41:57] <shoky> AcademyIntl: what's there to manage? yea just write your own
[19:42:07] <AcademyIntl> shoky: Thanks for your time.
[19:42:39] <shoky> np
[19:54:22] <sebastian_o|> can I force the menu of the autocomplete to open?
[19:55:39] <shoky> sebastian_o| see roadmap for jqui 1.9 http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137709/Autocomplete
[19:56:04] <shoky> there's gonna be a 'response' event
[19:56:09] <shoky> just for you ;D
[19:56:21] <sebastian_o|> :D
[19:58:41] <sebastian_o|> ok but I can manage by now by using success
[19:59:08] <shoky> yeah if its ajaxy thats not a problem to do a workaround
[19:59:08] <sebastian_o|> I think I'll have to force the ul to open
[19:59:13] <sebastian_o|> and close accordingly
[19:59:27] <shoky> what do you want it to show
[19:59:41] <shoky> if there are no results
[20:00:09] <sebastian_o|> the elements of the list doesn't get updated when the results are empty so it seems I'll have to remove those myself too
[20:00:40] <sebastian_o|> I want to show something when there are no matches to give the user the hint of adding a new item
[20:01:00] <sebastian_o|> I'm inserting  text and "Add a new blah" at the end of the list
[20:01:21] <sebastian_o|> problem is that when there are 0 results, the menu isn't shown at all
[20:01:57] <sebastian_o|> so I should show, no items for that term button to add one
[20:02:18] <sebastian_o|> "no items for that term" (button to add one)
[20:02:31] <sebastian_o|> makes sense?
[20:03:18] <sebastian_o|> anyways, I'll see this tomorrow, time to sleep :D
[20:03:22] <shoky> what about just showing your own element
[20:03:36] <shoky> not fiddling with the autocomplete
[20:03:37] <sebastian_o|> own element? what you mean?
[20:03:41] <sebastian_o|> not using autocomplete?
[20:03:48] <shoky> no no
[20:03:54] <shoky> just for the "empty list"
[20:04:00] <sebastian_o|> or a fake element with label "nothing found" ?
[20:04:07] <shoky> yea smth like that
[20:04:30] <sebastian_o|> I thought about it but it will be treated as an option that can be selected
[20:04:47] <sebastian_o|> would be smart for me to do it but confusing for the user when it happnes
[20:04:48] <shoky> what will
[20:05:10] <shoky> then don't make it look like a list item that you can select...
[20:05:33] <shoky> but like a hint popup or something
[20:05:35] <sebastian_o|> ok, but what about the mouse over or arrow keys plus enter?
[20:05:46] <shoky> what about them?
[20:06:06] <sebastian_o|> when the user hovers it will be highlited no?
[20:06:16] <shoky> huh
[20:06:22] <sebastian_o|> heh
[20:06:25] <shoky> i said to make your own element
[20:06:30] <shoky> why would it get highlighted
[20:06:52] <shoky> the autocomplete menu is not shown at that time
[20:06:53] <sebastian_o|> ah yeah you're right my own appended after the last li
[20:06:59] <Whirl3d> what is ARIA?
[20:07:04] <sebastian_o|> that's exactly what I aim to do
[20:07:17] <sebastian_o|> ah I get what you mean
[20:07:29] <shoky> Whirl3d: from what i could understand without reading much, its mostly for accessibility stuff
[20:07:32] <sebastian_o|> I could just show that totally decoupled of the ul
[20:07:36] <sebastian_o|> mmm yeah
[20:07:41] <tw2113> http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php
[20:07:56] <sebastian_o|> yeah shoky that sounds like a plan
[20:08:18] <sebastian_o|> I'll do that tomorrow, thanks for the chat
[20:08:24] <shoky> np
[20:08:24] <sebastian_o|> & good night
[20:08:25] <sebastian_o|> :D
[20:08:27] <shoky> nite
[20:09:43] <Whirl3d> if you extend an object's prototype with the jQuery prototype, you get all the jQuery goodness in that object, right?
[20:10:04] <Validatorian> What is the proper way to unbind a delegated event with .on? Example: http://jsfiddle.net/X7teS/
[20:11:09] <Validatorian> $(selector).off().on('click', '.delegatedClass', function () {}); doesn't work, as the .off applies to the parent, not the delegated item
[20:13:10] <shoky> Validatorian: http://api.jquery.com/off/
[20:14:40] <shoky> Validatorian: hint: you're calling .off() wrong
[20:14:49] <Validatorian> ya... changing it up
[20:15:16] <Validatorian> .off('click', '.dog').on('click', '.dog', function () {}) works -- thanks shoky
[20:15:54] <shoky> np
[20:20:19] <shoky> Whirl3d: what jq goodness will you want to use in your object?
[20:20:40] <Whirl3d> bind
[20:20:44] <Whirl3d> on
[20:20:49] <Whirl3d> trigger
[20:21:02] <shoky> nah dont think those will work
[20:21:18] <Whirl3d> I've been having limited success with using them on jquery wrapped objects
[20:21:21] <shoky> but
[20:21:39] <shoky> you can just do $(myObject).on(...).trigger(....)
[20:21:46] <shoky> which should work
[20:22:32] <Whirl3d> I am trying to figure out a reasonable way to implement a publish/subscribe system.
[20:23:14] <Whirl3d> Cork had me convinced to use .on and $.event.trigger, but we couldn't get it work with objects, only with jquerified dom elements
[20:23:40] <shoky> why not $(myObject).on(...).trigger(....)  ?
[20:24:17] <Whirl3d> the idea is that the gallery doesn't have a list of all the elements that need to be triggered.
[20:24:51] <shoky> mm so how does that conflict
[20:24:59] <Whirl3d> so using the global event $.event.trigger("cusomEvent"); should trigger all elements with $(obj).on("customEvent");
[20:25:18] <Whirl3d> but it doesn't work with generic objects for some reason. It works for dom elements
[20:26:49] <Whirl3d> and I guess it's a good idea to require components to "register" with the main program rather than having the program spit out a global event that any script can leach off of
[20:27:49] <shoky> yeah that's the "subscribe" part
[20:27:53] <Whirl3d> plus, using the global scope allows any element to fire the event...
[20:28:10] <Whirl3d> Yeah, so I have been working on it and it just gets so damned convoluted every time
[20:29:32] <Whirl3d> I figure I would have an object call the .publish(eventList) method to setup an assocatiave array of events and assign the subscribe method to that element.
[20:29:54] <Whirl3d> then other objects could subscribe to any of the events published by the first element
[20:30:42] <Whirl3d> Then, the first element would "announce" the event, thereby calling the callbacks on the subscribers listed i the publications array.
[20:36:15] <Whirl3d> I keep getting stuck in my pet project because I can't decide when to stop abstracting. Part of me feels like a "gallery" script should be divided into two classes: one that builds the gallery, one that controls it. I get about halfway down one path and realize the virtue o the other path and start over. bah

[20:45:39] <chousho> hello, hello
[20:45:56] <systemfault> HAI
[20:46:07] <shoky> Whirl3d: what about a "global" object g = $( {} )
[20:47:42] <shoky> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/S4CGY/
[20:48:33] <danzik171> Whirl3d: what shoky said works really well, i use wrote a mediator with that as the event emitter basically.  another alternative is http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/#pubsub
[20:49:50] <shoky> sweet
[21:00:11] <Whirl3d> Shoky, I'm checking it out now. Thanks for the reply. danzik171, thanks too, I'll check that out right away...
[21:11:41] <Whirl3d> topic=id && topics[id];   is basically evaluating that the id param exists and that topics[id] exists...so it's either true or false, correct?
[21:12:48] <rodd> just a question about selectors, $( '.alcohol' ) is (in terms of context) same as $( document ).find( '.alcohol' ); is that correct?
[21:14:11] <tw2113> wouldn't it be getElementByClass ?
[21:15:05] <rodd> I was thinking of using something like this: var selector = ( context && context instanceof jQuery ) ? context : $( document );
[21:17:39] <rodd> hm yeah that didnt work
[21:17:52] <rodd> hang on
[21:19:14] <rodd> works
[21:19:27] <rodd> forgot .find
[21:20:08] <rodd> but my doubt still stands, is it overhead?
[21:20:32] <rodd> $( '.smth' ); vs $( document ).find( '.smth' );
[21:21:43] <Whirl3d> I'm not an expert, by any means, but I think they are the same thing. When you execute $(".class"); it's the same as $(document).find(".class"); as far as I know.
[21:22:24] <danzik171> rodd: it's the same thing.
[21:22:34] <rodd> guess so uh
[21:22:35] <rodd> cool
[21:22:36] <rodd> thanks
[21:23:16] <tw2113> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L119
[21:23:43] <tw2113> maybe
[21:23:46] <tw2113> *tried*
[21:24:01] <rodd> context: The DOM node context originally passed to jQuery(); if none was passed then context will likely be the document.
[21:26:03] <Whirl3d> danzik171, am I missing something about the $.Topic method used in the example you provided. It appears that if you called the topic by specifying an id, the frist time would initialize the topic and setup it's methods. but the second time, it would just return true rather than the topic you defined.
[21:27:15] <Whirl3d> In fact, I don't see what good $.Topic is that $.Callbacks() doesn't provide regardless..
[21:27:32] <danzik171> Whirl3d: how do you figure
[21:28:40] <Whirl3d> other that changin the names to subscribe, publish and unsubscribe, isn't it just like: var item=$.Callbacks(); itm.fire();
[21:29:07] <danzik171> Whirl3d: well yea, that's the point.  it was to demonstrate implementing callbacks via pubsub...it's just sugar over callbacks.
[21:29:17] <danzik171> err, pubsub via callbacks.
[21:29:18] <Whirl3d> var item=$.Callbacks(); itm.add(somefunc);itm.fire();
[21:30:36] <Whirl3d> but is it my imagination or does this fail:  $.Topic("test").subscribe....yadayada  $.Topic("test").publish()   would return an error because True has no method publish
[21:31:10] <danzik171> Whirl3d: how are you figuring it returns true rather than the Topic?
[21:31:26] <Whirl3d> topic=id && topics[id];
[21:31:36] <Whirl3d> that's true or false, isn't it?
[21:32:06] <Whirl3d> isn't that topic=id!==undefined && topics[id]!==undefined
[21:32:16] <danzik171> no.
[21:32:25] <Whirl3d> cool. what is it then?
[21:32:29] <danzik171> if the first condition is truthy, the value is set to the second
[21:32:56] <Whirl3d> never ever seen that before (or if I have, didn't know it)
[21:33:17] <Whirl3d> why isn't it like I thought it was?
[21:35:24] <danzik171> because that's not how js works =P  http://es5.github.com/#x11.11
[21:35:41] <Whirl3d> wow. I wonder how many times I have used that same expression wrong and coudn't figure out why I wasn't getting a boolean response. LOL
[21:36:55] <Whirl3d> are there other perversions of the logic operators that I should now about...like var item=id!!topics[id];   ?
[21:37:29] <Whirl3d> maybe would return topics[id] if id was undefined...? Just kidding of course. but do you see what I mean?
[21:38:08] <danzik171> Whirl3d: that's what the || operator is for
[21:38:45] <Whirl3d> somehow, that makes sense though. Why am I fighting && I wonder...
[21:40:23] <Whirl3d> danzik171, thanks for the info. What a strange disconnect on my part.
[21:42:17] <shoky> Whirl3d it's  topic =   ( id && topics[ id ] )
[21:43:51] <shoky> Whirl3d it's really not perversions of the logic operators, they're actually purer than in most languages
[21:44:12] <Whirl3d> I just figured that out with ||
[21:44:40] <Whirl3d> it looked so weird to me, but || looks natural...stange the things that get stuck in your head when you get old...
[21:44:57] <danzik171> shoky: +1.   after really getting JS, it's painful for me to work in something like C# now
[21:45:10] <danzik171> what i can do in like 3 lines of JS takes a freaking page of boilerplate.
[21:45:23] <shoky> ;) same for me with java :P
[21:45:41] <Whirl3d> I still don't understand why a global topics library is needed for $.Topic  ?
[21:47:01] <Whirl3d> it's slowly swimming into focus...still thinking it through....
[21:47:58] <shoky> i think it's so that the same subscriber won't subscribe twice to the same topic
[21:48:10] <Whirl3d> $.Callbacks('unique');
[21:48:19] <Whirl3d> enforces single subscriber adds
[21:48:49] <danzik171> Whirl3d: it's just sugar like i said.  otherwise, you end up either implementing the same thing yourself, or your code doesn't stay DRY
[21:48:52] <shoky> it enforces single execution of a callback, no?
[21:49:00] <Whirl3d> but it ensures that the same callback stacks is used...
[21:49:03] <danzik171> shoky: no, that's memory
[21:49:11] <danzik171> i think?
[21:49:11] <shoky> hmm
[21:49:33] <danzik171> shoky: nah, it's once, just looked
[21:49:38] <shoky> ohh
[21:50:15] <Whirl3d> I think because you would have two callback stacks if you didn't keep a reference.
[21:51:28] <Whirl3d> so one element could subscribe to two different callback stacks if you didn't keep a library...you could presumably end up with two callbacks with the same invocation name
[21:52:03] <Whirl3d> in which case there'd be no use for the id in the first place, but...well I think I'm getting it
[21:52:49] <Whirl3d> so I could implement a collection of $.Callback stacks, one for each event and then setup deferreds to handle their automatic firing based on event completion.
[21:54:21] <shoky> ah yea you're right it's just so there'll be only one callback stack for each topic
[21:55:14] <shoky> it wouldn't be needed if the API was just:   var mailArrivedTopic = $.Topic('mailArrived');  mailArrivedTopic.subscribe(fn1); mailArrivedTopic.subscribe(fn2);
[21:55:45] <Whirl3d> agreed.
[21:56:15] <Whirl3d> which could also be var mailArrived=$.Callbacks(); mailArrived.add(fn1).add(fn2).fire();
[21:56:34] <shoky> yep
[21:56:41] <Whirl3d> though I am not sure if it's chainable like that...
[21:56:44] <danzik171> and is mailArrived gonna always be in scope?  or are you gonna make it a global?
[21:57:15] <danzik171> and what happens when you have more than a few events, do you have N globals, one for each?
[21:57:20] <shoky> yeah that's a more limited API of course
[21:58:08] <shoky> i didn't mean that the API as it is should change ;P
[21:58:09] <Whirl3d> I plan to create a publish method that adds the callback object to the "publsher" object and enables subscribe and unsubscribe...
[21:58:31] <Whirl3d> that would  in effect scope the callback object, wouldn't it?
[21:58:53] <Whirl3d> Is there a way to prevent it from being fired by another object like promises do for deferreds?
[22:00:10] <shoky> didnt get what you mean
[22:00:35] <k_sze> I don't understand how to use jQuery. I am trying to find the computed width of a few <li> items on this page: http://wptest.kalunite.net/
[22:00:44] <Whirl3d> presumably  object1=$.Callback()   and object2 could  call object1.fire();
[22:01:16] <Whirl3d> like with deferreds, you return the promise, which does not allow the receiver of the promise to call the resolve or reject method on the source deferred
[22:01:33] <k_sze> I do `nav_ul_li = $("#nav > ul > li")` and get an array of DOM objects, but I can't go like `nav_ul_li[0].width()`. Why is that?
[22:02:08] <systemfault> Whirl3d: I haven't seen the implementation but I guess that .promise simply returns a wrapped object
[22:02:13] <shoky> k_sze: nav_ul_li.eq(0).width()
[22:02:18] <systemfault> s/object/deferred
[22:02:22] <Whirl3d> because you are calling the width() method (a jquery method) on the dom element.
[22:02:37] <shoky> k_sze: as you said it's an array of DOM objects (sort of..), so you cant call .width() on a regular DOM object
[22:02:50] <Cork> Whirl3d: no eq returns a jquery object
[22:02:59] <Cork> its get or [] that returns a dom object
[22:03:00] <Whirl3d> that was shoky
[22:03:09] <Whirl3d> right, which is what he asked
[22:03:19] <Whirl3d> nav_ul_li[0].width()
[22:03:22] <Cork> -_-'
[22:03:30] <Cork> ok, i need to wake up (sorry about that)
[22:03:35] <Whirl3d> np
[22:03:38] <shoky> ;p
[22:04:19] <ENQ> hmm i have my config in myplugin wraped function, its like private or smth, how can i make it accessable through some function or smth
[22:04:40] <shoky> lol
[22:05:23] <Whirl3d> systemfault, so I guess I would just make the $.Callbacks object a private member of the "publisher" object...and expose the subscribe and unsubscribe methods
[22:05:35] <ENQ> if anyone would look i used https://github.com/addyosmani/jquery-plugin-patterns/blob/master/patterns/jquery.basic.plugin-boilerplate.js this example :)
[22:05:46] <shoky> i dont really understand what the "publisher" object is
[22:06:02] <systemfault> shoky: It's the element that fires the event
[22:06:18] <systemfault> shoky: subscribers "listen" to publishers
[22:06:34] <shoky> don't they listen to "publications" of a "topic"
[22:06:35] <Whirl3d> for example, when my "gallery" shows a new item, it "announces" the "NEW ITEM" event to the listeners that have registered with it
[22:07:17] <systemfault> shoky: To be honest with you… I'm only familiar with topics on a message queueing system
[22:07:18] <shoky> oks
[22:07:28] <Whirl3d> I would rather that you call the subscribe method of an object with the "topic" id that you want to listen to.
[22:07:28] <systemfault> Not with a traditional pub/sub implementation
[22:08:13] <Whirl3d> then the publisher of said topic decorates the subscriber as necessary and calls a method on the subscriber when the event resolves
[22:08:34] <Whirl3d> a classic example is the gallery:
[22:08:35] <shoky> systemfault yeah in that context it's just called topic/subscribe or smth
[22:08:48] <Whirl3d> I have a dynamic bacground that changes color to match each slide's color preference
[22:09:13] <Whirl3d> by publishing the "NEW ITEM" event, my BG class subscribes to it and automatically adjusts the background
[22:09:46] <Whirl3d> Same is true for my thumbnails...they listen to the NEW ITEM event and changethe "current' thumbnail
[22:09:58] <Whirl3d> and my infoPanel (which displays the slide info)...
[22:10:36] <systemfault> Hmm
[22:10:49] <systemfault> Whirl3d: You could take a look at what backbone did
[22:11:07] <yoga> anyone can recommended jquery book for beginner?
[22:11:07] <Whirl3d> I could call them all from the gallery, but that would require that the gallery know about them in advance...this way, you can add any features you want so long as they subscribe to the "published" events
[22:11:21] <Whirl3d> backbone, huh? I'll look into it
[22:11:25] <shoky> yoga: http://jqfundamentals.com
[22:12:20] <systemfault> Whirl3d: https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js From like 61
[22:12:36] <yoga> shoky: ok thanks
[22:12:41] <papelboyl1> Is it possible to read an XML file via FTP using jquery? thanks :)
[22:12:54] <systemfault> s/like/line :/
[22:12:56] <Whirl3d> so a similar method to my subscribe method is the register method. The difference is that you register a control that has the ability to fire the callbacks as necessary...I just need to figure out how to protect the callbacks from being fired by non-registered elements.
[22:13:31] <Whirl3d> systemfault, I'm looking now. thanks for the link
[22:14:15] <systemfault> It might not be exactly what you're looking for but.. it could be a starting point
[22:15:27] <shoky> Whirl3d why not just use a var globalEvents = $( {} ); ?
[22:15:51] <Whirl3d> how do you mean?
[22:16:19] <Cork> papelboyl1: yes you can get files from ftp as long as its not cross domain
[22:16:34] <Cork> papelboyl1: and by defenition http => ftp is cross domain :)
[22:17:09] <Cork> papelboyl1: scp should make it possible in modern browsers though
[22:17:11] <shoky> Whirl3d nvm im getting too tired to think ;p
[22:17:12] <Cork> *csp
[22:18:39] <Whirl3d> I thin the $.Callbacks object is going to make things a lot easier. I'll look for you tomorrow with hopefully a close-to-finished publish.subscribe model if you are interested.
[22:18:55] <systemfault> Cute
[22:19:05] <shoky> ya i'll wanna
[22:19:29] <Whirl3d> Keep in mind, I tend to write way too much bs and it'll need a lot of pruning...lol
[22:21:20] <papelboyl1> thanks cork
[22:21:27] <shoky> this channel has created a bs filter in my brain, no worries
[22:21:29] <Cork> np
[22:21:52] <papelboyl1> I guess I can always hosts the files somewhere
[22:22:18] <Cork> papelboyl1: you could proxy it over a php script or something
[22:22:29] <Cork> if you don't want to store a stale copy
[22:22:35] <papelboyl1> no access to php in this "box"
[22:22:44] <papelboyl1> that's why I'm limited to javascript
[22:26:48] <shoky> what's csp?
[22:27:43] <sacho> c server pages?
[22:27:51] <Cork> ?mdc csp
[22:27:52] <caniuse> Cork: CSP (Content Security Policy) - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Security/CSP
[22:28:19] <shoky> oh. never heard of that
[22:28:22] <systemfault> Never heard of that term
[22:29:04] <Cork> it lets you ex. allow cross domain ajax to a serten site
[22:29:10] <Cork> or you can block inline scripts
[22:29:11] <systemfault> Is it a Mozilla-only thing?
[22:29:13] <Cork> and so on
[22:29:14] <Cork> no
[22:29:29] <Cork> csp is supported by chrome, firefox and ie as far as i know
[22:29:40] <Cork> though as always ie implementes it messy
[22:30:10] <Cork> it doesn't affect xmlhttprequest, they use a XDomainRequest instead -_-'
[22:30:16] <Cork> (in ie)
[22:30:48] <Cork> and XDomainRequest can only send as text/plain, and there by makes it fairly pointless
[22:31:28] <systemfault> It's only a draft… :/
[22:31:45] <systemfault> And different browsers use different headers.. :(
[22:31:52] <systemfault> Makes it hardly usable.
[22:32:02] <systemfault> The official name of the HTTP header field is Content-Security-Policy.
[22:32:02] <systemfault> Mozilla Firefox and the preview release of Internet Explorer use the header name X-Content-Security-Policy. Google Chrome uses X-WebKit-CSP. Support for the draft in Firefox and Chrome is nearly complete.[2]
[22:32:43] <systemfault> Oh well :/
[22:50:07] <shoky> i'm confused as to the difference between this and CORS
[22:50:13] <shoky> i suck at security shit :S
[23:15:33] <rags> Hi, I'm trying to use bootstrap-typeahead.js , but the dropdown/autocomplete suggestions only shows the first letter of the match, instead of the whole world
[23:15:45] <rags> You can see it here : http://jsfiddle.net/gGkyF/
[23:20:50] <donkeycongo> Is it possible to trigger the oninput event?
[23:23:19] <ENQ> on key press?
[23:24:34] <donkeycongo> No, on pageload. Im not sure if its relevant, actually. Im using the .autosize() plugin, and it does not resize the textarea before the content changes.
[23:26:27] <ENQ> and you need to set its size?
[23:27:44] <gayan> Hi
[23:27:46] <donkeycongo> I need it to adjust before the content changes, since it will contain some by default.
[23:28:23] <ENQ> donkeycongo, just put it into ready?
[23:28:37] <gayan> Is that possible to use $.post with java back end
[23:29:15] <donkeycongo> ENQ: I have. It does trigger, but for some reason it doesnt resize.
[23:30:02] <ENQ> donkeycongo, trigger an event on textarea?
[23:30:35] <ENQ> $("#area").trigger('autosize')
[23:31:07] * shoky slaps Cork around a bit with a wakeboard
[23:31:21] <Cork> ?
[23:32:00] <raj> whatup yo
[23:32:07] <donkeycongo> ENQ: I have.
[23:32:12] <shoky> rags: http://jsfiddle.net/gGkyF/2/
[23:32:28] <shoky> rags: you passed a string instead of an array...
[23:32:40] <raj> rhagav?
[23:32:45] <rags> shoky, oh, awesome, thx!
[23:33:14] <shoky> cork , what's the diff between CPS and CORS ? im sure they're quite different but reading about it just confuses me more
[23:33:24] <shoky> sup raj
[23:33:32] <raj> :) nm
[23:33:41] <shoky> 9:30 am
[23:33:42] <Cork> shoky: they'r not, they'r part of each other
[23:33:44] <shoky> bah
[23:33:52] <raj> just coding and watching tv, the yoosh
[23:34:08] <raj> i know, what're you doing up so early??
[23:34:10] <shoky> cork ohhh , how come i can't find@google anything related to them both ?
[23:34:34] <Cork> shoky: its standards that extends how you from the header can instruct the browser whats allowed
[23:34:41] <shoky> for example, CORS spec didnt mention CPS
[23:35:36] <shoky> raj dono i love delaying sleep :((
[23:35:42] <raj> wait, wtf?
[23:35:45] <raj> haha
[23:35:52] <shoky> i also love sleeping
[23:36:02] <raj> i'm in the same boat
[23:36:09] <raj> i stay awake as long as possible, and then sleep as long as possible
[23:36:23] <raj> it's our circadian rhythms
[23:36:40] <shoky> Cork: so mm what does 'theyre part of each other' mean? :P
[23:36:50] <Cork> shoky: read the first sentence https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Security/CSP and the top of https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control
[23:36:52] <shoky> heh raj me too
[23:37:24] <shoky> i guess that was redundant to say
[23:37:29] <shoky> F U I M TIRED
[23:37:32] <Cork> shoky: csp regulates what content in the page can do, cors regualtes what http can do
[23:38:00] <Cork> csp regulates ex. from what origin js is executed, if inline scripts is allowed to run and so on
[23:38:14] <Cork> cors affects the cross origin rules
[23:38:37] <Cork> like if one domain is allowed to xhr another or if a font is allowed to be loaded from there
[23:39:31] <shoky> that looks like the answer i needed
[23:39:43] <shoky> i'll find out tomorrow when im able to read it properly ;)
[23:39:47] <shoky> thanks
[23:39:51] <Cork> i mainly look at them as one standard though
[23:40:10] <Cork> cause that they affect is intimately intertwined
[23:45:07] <shoky> ok i think i understand. thanks again
[23:49:41] <shoky> raj i have to be up tomorrow at 10am (in 24 hrs), wat do i do ; <
[23:50:06] <phr> re :)
