[01:33:55] <Gorkyman> hey guys... anyone using anything else to debug js/jquery other than firebug?
[01:56:44] <dragon> Gorkyman: yes, chrome inspector
[01:58:54] <dragon> This room's quality of conversation is extremely poor. Signal to noise ratio is extremely low, and most of the questions asked are DUMB questions.
[01:59:01] <dragon> I'm out.
[02:12:46] <ThiefMaster> http://api.jquery.com/live/ <- the top menu layout on that page is pretty broken
[02:27:40] <r3za> hey guys i wrote this and i want background position x , but i got nothing except 0 , please help http://pastebin.com/cuhA9Lfc
[02:29:03] <coldhead> ?eval alert(object);
[02:29:05] <bot-t> coldhead: ReferenceError: object is not defined
[02:29:32] <coldhead> r3za: what is object?
[02:30:15] <nlogax> unfortunately no one can be told what object is
[02:30:45] <r3za> coldhead: a li tag
[02:31:56] <r3za> coldhead: no no , im wrong , its like this : <li><a href="#" class="uparrow"></a></li>, i want background position in uparraow class for example
[02:35:24] <coldhead> this is a very hard problem
[02:36:19] <coldhead> ?lint @ r3za
[02:36:20] <bot-t> r3za, if you're bored waiting for someone to fix your broken code you can always try to find the problem yourself by pasting it into http://jsHint.com/
[02:36:38] <r3za> coldhead: how can i select an a tag into a li
[02:38:16] <coldhead> SELECT a_tag AS li FROM dom; ?
[02:38:37] <coldhead> i don't know how in jquery reza
[02:38:50] <coldhead> i think it is hard
[02:42:54] <xec> coldhead: he said "into", i think he wants: INSERT INTO li VALUES ("a tag")
[02:47:30] <dr0id> slidetoggle works in up and down direction, can it be made to work in the left and right directions ?
[02:49:08] <xec> dr0id: yes, just rotate the container
[02:49:21] <dr0id> ok, will do
[02:49:25] <xec> lol
[02:49:30] <xec> it was a joke ;)
[02:49:45] <Haduss__> Hello
[02:49:46] <xec> why don't you just animate the width instead
[02:52:49] <Haduss__> anyone speak german?
[02:53:54] <chousho> there's ##deutsch for that :D
[02:56:06] <xec> Haduss__: there is actually a #jquery-de
[02:57:01] <coldhead> that's my favourite of the euro channels
[03:24:41] <jita> Is there a way to find default value (initial value) of radiobox input in change event handler ?
[03:28:44] <xec> jita: not that i know of. you could save state on load in each radio buttons .data() or something though
[03:29:08] <dabear> jita: the default value of any checkbox is unchecked
[03:29:31] <dabear> unless the attribute "checked" is present
[03:30:04] <xec> isn't the attribute updated on change?
[03:30:58] <jita> dabear, i am passing the default explicitly in template
[03:31:29] <dabear> jita: ok, then .prop("defaultChecked")
[03:31:58] <jita> dabear, thanks a lot
[04:06:24] <topriddy> i need ideas on how to approach having a user sort items in a table according to agrreed preferences
[04:06:39] <topriddy> like have two buttons and then she can move up or down
[04:06:42] <topriddy> please anybody
[04:17:42] <shrewm> can somebody please help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/QFgDv/ I can not get it to work. I just want to replace the src of ONE image of the three (depens on which one the user clicks). The solution I got here doesn´t work at all (the src is not replaced). If I change all "this" to ".check" every img-src on the website is of course replaced. How can I just modify one image?
[04:32:29] <topriddy> i need ideas on how to approach having a user sort items in a table according to agrreed preferences
[04:40:23] <m0dmd> shrewm: have you figured it out?
[04:40:45] <eBuntu> Im looking into i18n with jQuery for the first time. Content for nodes is straight forward, but can anyone suggest how to handle i18n of attributes, like titles on <a>? All I can think of is something like data-i18n="attrName:substitutionKey" but that seems clunky.
[04:42:38] <shrewm> m0dmd : no, can not get it to work, dont know how to fix it
[04:42:46] <m0dmd> topriddy: hope this helps http://www.picnet.com.au/resources/tablefilter/demo.htm
[04:55:34] <shrewm> m0dmd : you got something for me?
[04:57:42] <m0dmd> one sec
[05:03:06] <shrewm> sure thanks
[05:05:52] <m0dmd> shrewm: http://jsfiddle.net/QFgDv/17/
[05:07:19] <c0d3rg1rl> If I have a dynamically created inline json like var json = [{name:'xx',data:'yy'}, {name:'xx2',data:'yy2'}, {name:'xx3',data:'yy3'}]; what would be the best jquery way to retrieve the data-value if I know the name-value?
[05:07:29] <topriddy> m0dmd: thanks would have a look
[05:07:39] <m0dmd> topriddy: yw
[05:08:09] <c0d3rg1rl> I can loop through the whole json with e.g. jQuery.each(json, function(i) {}) and compare the name, but is there a better way?
[05:08:56] <shrewm> m0dmd : let me check that :D
[05:09:40] <m0dmd> c0d3rg1rl: echo obj.name ?
[05:10:32] <c0d3rg1rl> m0dmd: I have 'xx2' as var, I want to get 'yy2', possibly without looping through the whole json
[05:11:41] <m0dmd> so your question is if there is a function that searches an array for a key
[05:12:11] <m0dmd> c0d3rg1rl:  maybe this will help http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[05:14:01] <c0d3rg1rl> m0dmd: how would I look into the obj within the array withthat?
[05:14:19] <c0d3rg1rl> I tried before, maybe I am too blind to see ;-)
[05:30:15] <c0d3rg1rl> using this now: var search='xx2'; alert(jQuery.grep(json, function(elem, i) { return (elem.name == search) ? elem : false; })[0].data);
[05:30:23] <c0d3rg1rl> but looks still a bit complicated.. ;-)
[05:36:07] <Monkeypaws> i've got a hackjob of a site put together for my robot, i have some really stupid nubby questions, could someone help me out?
[05:36:08] <Monkeypaws> morning btw.
[05:39:06] <coldhead> can you be more specific?
[05:40:24] <Monkeypaws> well, my problem is that i've been hacking together code for my site, adding different scripts, different event handlers, functions and what not, but it's grown to be somewhat unmanagable for me and it doesnt make much sense to me anymore.  I'm not sure how to aggregate my jquery/javascript code or if i can or should or what... basically i want to make it less of a hackjob
[05:41:11] <Monkeypaws> can i put all the jquery stuff in one js file?
[05:41:21] <Monkeypaws> or should i seperate them based on function?
[05:41:35] <Monkeypaws> or event?
[05:42:13] <coldhead> Monkeypaws: it depends, it depends
[05:42:15] <coldhead> :)
[05:42:17] <Monkeypaws> doh
[05:42:22] <coldhead> its harder to do once you're already underway
[05:42:29] <coldhead> but you'll grow as a person
[05:42:35] <Monkeypaws> haha
[05:42:37] <coldhead> if i were you i'd check out either of these
[05:42:40] <coldhead> and possibly both
[05:42:42] <coldhead> http://www.slideshare.net/SlexAxton/how-to-manage-large-jquery-apps
[05:42:49] <coldhead> http://www.slideshare.net/rmurphey/building-large-jquery-applications
[05:43:06] <coldhead> they're not too long and they'll cover some options
[05:43:21] <Monkeypaws> awesome thanks for the links
[05:44:13] <coldhead> best bet is to have a go and show us what you come up with for further advice
[05:44:16] <coldhead> if you still need it
[05:44:18] <coldhead> good luck!
[05:44:20] <onats> hey guys
[05:44:38] <onats> I'm looking for an image cropper + rotate tool. is there a plugin readily available for that?
[05:46:41] <Monkeypaws> hey coldhead
[05:47:11] <Monkeypaws> this says "above all else: use jquery as the DOM and Ajax [as the] tool it is, not a framework"
[05:47:20] <Monkeypaws> can you explain what that means or is it all zen like?
[05:47:34] <coldhead> onats: this is a nice cropper, don't know about one with a built in rotater
[05:47:37] <coldhead> http://deepliquid.com/projects/Jcrop/demos.php?demo=advanced
[05:48:07] <coldhead> Monkeypaws: i believe they mean you should use jQuery for the stuff it's good at like ajax and DOM selection and events
[05:48:15] <onats> coldhead: you've used it? I have to implement the actual cropping on server side right?
[05:48:24] <coldhead> but if you're building an entire "app" you should use some other tools
[05:48:28] <coldhead> like requirejs or backbone
[05:48:36] <Monkeypaws> gothca
[05:48:40] <coldhead> and or a templater
[05:48:50] <coldhead> onats: yes, server side
[05:49:17] <coldhead> onats: http://mothereffinganimatedgif.com/
[05:49:25] <coldhead> you CAN do some stuff in the browser
[05:49:30] <coldhead> but it's bleeding edge
[05:49:37] <coldhead> and won't work in a lot of browsers
[05:49:51] <onats> no, i prefer to do it server side.. as the images are in S3
[05:52:02] <coldhead> onats: https://github.com/sheldon/jquery-cropzoom
[05:52:16] <coldhead> supposedly that does rotation but i can't find a demo
[05:52:24] <coldhead> well i can't find a live demo
[05:52:28] <coldhead> you'll have to download and
[05:52:29] <coldhead> ?tias
[05:52:29] <bot-t> Try It And See
[05:52:54] <onats> yes, looks like theres no demo
[05:53:01] <onats> btw, another question guys
[05:53:05] <coldhead> there's one you can download
[05:53:07] <onats> I'm not really an expert in javascript
[05:53:17] <coldhead> https://github.com/sheldon/jquery-cropzoom/tree/master/demo
[05:53:20] <coldhead> me either onats
[05:53:24] <onats> but i keep on using jquery in most/all of my projects. is there any harm on this?
[05:53:29] <coldhead> it's pretty much my first day
[05:53:31] <onats> there are other projects which actually don't use it..
[05:53:46] <coldhead> using the most popular js lib is pretty safe
[05:54:01] <coldhead> i can only think of one case where it was a big deal
[05:54:06] <coldhead> for the guardian website
[05:54:17] <coldhead> they upgraded their jQ without sufficient testing
[05:54:27] <coldhead> and bugs arose
[05:54:42] <coldhead> that's not jQ's fault though, really
[05:54:58] <coldhead> but then #jQuery WOULD tell you to use jQuery
[05:55:08] <onats> coldhead: right. query's so easy, i wonder why not everyone uses it
[05:56:27] <coldhead> some people don't want things to be easy
[05:56:34] <coldhead> weirdos
[05:58:40] <m0dmd> coldhead: ROFL >>> it'll help you grow as a person
[05:58:46] <m0dmd> My laugh of the morning!
[05:58:50] <m0dmd> Good morning!!
[05:59:42] <coldhead> welcome to today, m0dmd
[06:00:16] <m0dmd> :)
[06:03:32] <shrewm> m0dmd: i got it working now, but once I click an img, i can not click it again unless I refresh the page. is this on purpose when using .one() ?
[06:03:58] <m0dmd> shrewm: no it is not possible, so use .click()
[06:04:20] <m0dmd> http://api.jquery.com/click/
[06:05:11] <shrewm> hmm
[06:06:27] <shrewm> I already did try that, but then again every or no img was changed
[06:06:57] <shrewm> oh wait, I did as mistake I think
[06:07:14] <jaffa> Can somebody please tell me the effects used in this page?  ----- http://themeforest.net/item/auzora-one-page-portfolio-and-business-theme/full_screen_preview/102832
[06:08:13] <m0dmd> shrewm, not with the version i gave you
[06:08:42] <shrewm> m0dmd:  I got it working :D wohow :) Thanks a lot!
[06:08:44] <koulchilebaiz_> hi all, i would like to know if there's a simple method for a faded image rollover ? i found this one but i cant make it work, whats the '#the_image' at the beginning of the code ?
[06:09:02] <m0dmd> shrewm: yw
[06:09:07] <shrewm> this part was breaking my head yesterday evening :)
[06:17:34] <iamntz> hey guys, any idea how i could get css animation keyframes with js/jquery? i can only detect webkitAnimationEnd for now, but i would like add events for certain keyframes (like 50%, 80% and so on). thanks!
[06:20:43] <simon> hello
[06:21:08] <simon> I'm trying to figure out the easiest way to do AJAX requests. is there a $.post like there is a $.get?
[06:21:37] <Monkeypaws> yah
[06:21:40] <simon> cool
[06:22:07] <Monkeypaws> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[06:22:09] <Monkeypaws> like that?
[06:22:59] <coldhead> ?post
[06:23:00] <bot-t> jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[06:23:04] <coldhead> like that
[06:26:20] <Monkeypaws> I need to take a username entered on a form and somehow save it for another event handler.  They enter their username in a box, then click submit.  That loads a chatbox div, and there's another submit button for submitting chat msg's.  I'm not sure how to capture the username entered in the first form to be used in the msg submit event handler
[06:26:28] <Monkeypaws> if that makes any sense.. whatsoever... :x
[06:27:46] <Monkeypaws> both event handlers are in login.js
[06:27:50] <Monkeypaws> if that helps
[06:37:34] <sahbeewah> read the username textbox value?
[06:39:56] <kesor> question, the $.each() sets "this" as the dom element in the iterator, is there a similar loop that sets it to the jquery element?
[06:41:38] <sahbeewah> you can wrap dom elements with $()
[06:42:03] <kesor> yeah, but why would I if I already have them? â¦ I really dislike th e $(this) syntax, it does not feel right somehow.
[06:43:16] <Ret12> At the start of the function, I think the following is commonly used: "var $this = $(this);"
[06:43:52] <Ret12> Then just use $this, and every time you call it again you don't have to slow your app by wrapping it in $.
[06:44:17] <kesor> exactly the thing I am trying to avoid, it does not feel wrong to you at all?
[06:49:41] <Monkeypaws> how do i carry a variable over from one event to another event?
[06:50:09] <xec> kesor: very often you only need the native DOM element, so it's a lot cleaner than creating an unnecessary jquery object that needs to be unwrapped
[06:50:11] <Ret12> kesor: $.each() likely doesn't wrap it such that people who just need 'this' won't slow their app with that unnecessary wrap. If there was an alternative to $.each() which did so, ultimately some coders would use it when they should be using the regular one, and thus unknowingly slow their application.
[06:50:20] <Ret12> And what he said.
[06:50:34] <xec> actually, i assume you mean $().each() and not $.each()
[06:50:37] <kesor> xec: agreed, but I don't mind if the function was called differently for this cale.
[06:50:55] <kesor> xec: for example $().each_slice() or something
[06:51:28] <kesor> Ret12: I want to avoid the wrap completely, as the objects are already there and re-wrapping them is silly.
[06:52:19] <xec> i imagine you could create your own relatively easily
[06:52:42] <kesor> my point being, is it a good idea to have the option (maybe named differently) to iterate over jquery objects, and why isn't there a standard function like that today?  (everyone doing the ugly $(this) re-wrapping all over the place)
[06:52:45] <Ret12> You could add your own function for your program, if you want. Probably would use Function.call or apply to pass '$(this)' as 'this' to $().each.
[06:53:22] <kesor> xec: I was thinking of using .slice() inside this function that I write, any thoughts about it vs. re-wrapping with $(this) ?
[06:53:58] <xec> kesor: hmm, that doesn't make much sense to me
[06:54:12] <xec> kesor: i mean, inside the loop you only have one element, what would you slice?
[06:54:35] <simon> it seems that jQuery.parseJSON(foodata) throws an error. what's the common way to parse JSON from an Ajax request?
[06:54:40] <kesor> what I mean is something like this: https://gist.github.com/2622346
[06:56:33] <Ret12> simon: Your JSON has to be completely well formed to be parsed by parseJSON, I believe.
[06:58:17] <asher^> anyone know how i can convert an object into an array? i tried $.makeArray but it just gave me an array with the object inside
[06:59:17] <xec> kesor: who not use the handy .each() to build on? http://jsfiddle.net/w79Dr/
[06:59:53] <kesor> xec: you are doing the $(this) which is the whole reason I wrote this in the first place :)
[07:00:04] <xec> kesor: not in the loopsie
[07:00:41] <kesor> xec: for each element â¦ the difference is I am using slice() instead.
[07:00:42] <xec> i just made a plugin that converts this to a jquery object inside the loopsie function
[07:01:04] <xec> kesor: yes, my question was why
[07:01:16] <kesor> xec: I am assuming .slice() is faster than $(this)
[07:01:31] <xec> why would you assume that
[07:01:42] <kesor> you are right, I should probably test it instead of assuming.
[07:03:48] <simon> Ret12, I actually just sent the output of PHP's encode_json(), but maybe they disagree. I get "4Uncaught Error: NOT_FOUND_ERR: DOM Exception 8
[07:05:35] <simon> it looks good. it escapes the forward slash, but that's the only oddity.
[07:07:04] <xec> simon: you could throw your json in http://jsonlint.com/
[07:08:15] <bobbytek2> anyone using dataTable?
[07:08:19] <simon> xec, valid.
[07:08:26] <bobbytek2> Is it possible to chain api methods?
[07:08:28] <simon> [{"id":"1","title":"Untitled","body":"<p>This is a test.<\/p>","updated":"2012-05-06 14:22:32","created":"2012-05-06 14:22:32"}]
[07:08:35] <Ret12> simon: Are you sure the JSON is throwing the error? Sounds like its another problem in your code.
[07:08:43] <bobbytek2> hate having to repeat the table variable on each call
[07:09:12] <simon> Ret12, well, if I just $("#foo").html(data); I get the JSON. if I var foo = jQuery.parseJSON(data); $("#foo").html(foo); I get the error.
[07:09:43] <Ret12> simon: foo is an object. You'll need to convert it to a string.
[07:09:46] <simon> is it because the object doesn't translate to DOM stuff?
[07:09:51] <simon> ah. silly me.
[07:11:15] <simon> thanks!
[07:12:06] <kesor> xec: tested this vs. slice, and $(this) wins. http://jsperf.com/jquery-this-vs-slice
[07:12:30] <xec> ^^
[07:13:51] <Ret12> kesor: Hey, could you use the varible you're calling .each on, with .eq(i), the i being the iterator passed to the function by .each?
[07:14:37] <kesor> Ret12: .eq() is just another way to use slice then?
[07:15:33] <Ret12> I'm doing too many things at once.
[07:16:07] <kesor> Ret12: updated the jsperf page, .eq() is as slow as .slice()
[07:16:27] <Ret12> I see... interesting.
[07:16:51] <kesor> at least in chrome on mac, which is what I test it in.
[07:17:13] <Ret12> Firefox on XP here. Same.
[07:21:30] <simon> can someone recommend a way to easily explore the content of an object passed from a .getJSON() call?
[07:21:45] <kesor> simon: use console.log() on it
[07:21:50] <simon> kesor, thanks.
[07:23:00] <swombat> jQuery-UI question... why doesn't $(".date_field").datepicker({dateFormat: "dd/mm/yyyy"}); work?
[07:23:20] <swombat> i.e. it doesn't give me the format... in fact, it doesn't put anything in the field after I select a date
[07:23:22] <simon> so I get a JSON object that contains all the right properties, but when I do obj.title, etc., it gives back undefined.
[07:23:35] <swombat> er
[07:23:37] <swombat> yy i mean
[07:25:05] <dns-away> hello
[07:25:06] <swombat> am I specifying the dateFormat option wrong?
[07:26:22] <swombat> do I have to use something like $( ".selector" ).datepicker( "option", "dateFormat", "yy-mm-dd" ); instead?
[07:26:28] <swombat> (cause that didn't work at all)
[07:26:40] <dns-away> i have textarea and function on keyCode=13 $(this).val(), and work, but how i can clear newline from the text area ?
[07:26:53] <Ret12> simon: Is your JSON object an array with the object stuff inside it? obj[0].title then.
[07:27:11] <swombat> (the datepicker doesn't appear at all)
[07:27:13] <dns-away> or if keyCode=13 exec function focusout ? :-)
[07:27:33] <simon> Ret12, yeah, I just figured out. :P
[07:27:42] <swombat> if I do $(".date_field").datepicker("option", "dateFormat", "dd/mm/yy"); I mean
[07:30:29] <swombat> anyone? surely this is a fairly common scenario integrating a datepicker with a rails app...
[07:31:04] <Ret12> swombat: "mm-dd-yy is the correct format for a full year"
[07:31:24] <Ret12> So... yyyy would be "20122012"? But that's not your problem?
[07:31:41] <swombat> the code is currently using yy, not yyyy
[07:31:44] <swombat> still doesn't work
[07:32:06] <swombat> I get the datepicker, but nothing is set in the field
[07:32:40] <swombat> that's if I use the {dateFormat: "dd/mm/yy"} format... if I use "option", "dateFormat", "dd/mm/yy" like in the docs, I don't even get the datepicker
[07:33:01] <swombat> if i set no options at all, the datepicker works fine but uses mm/dd/yy as its format, as per the docs
[07:36:05] <n00by> I need someone who uses chosen (http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/) - I want to render dropdown on body
[07:36:10] <Ret12> dns-away: If I understand correctly, you want to prevent enter from forming a newline? Then the event must return false. And can't be onkeyup, as that fires after the character is printed.
[07:36:37] <Ret12> Dangit, I'm too slow.
[07:41:04] <Ret12> swombat: I can't tell what's wrong with the info you've posted so far, but you could show us more of your code with JSFiddle or somesuch. there could be other problems, such as not wrapping it in a function running on DOM ready.
[07:41:19] <swombat> hmm
[07:41:28] <swombat> ok, i'll look into that, thanks
[07:42:05] <Ret12> n00by: Chosen is pretty cool, but I don't know what you mean to ask.
[07:43:19] <n00by> Ret12, chosen renders the dropdown within the container, which can lead to z-index issue (https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen/issues/59)
[07:43:20] <socialhapy> â Issue #59 on chosen (tompaton; 9m, 1w ago): Dropdown inside a dialog is hidden (scrolled out of view)
[07:44:10] <n00by> so I'd like to render it within body, set position: absolute
[07:44:15] <Ret12> dns-away: If I understand correctly, you want to prevent enter from forming a newline? Then the event must return false. And can't be onkeyup, as that fires after the character is printed.
[07:44:18] <n00by> and just manage the offset
[07:44:32] <dns-away> Ret12, will show you demo
[07:44:43] <n00by> there's also: https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen/issues/59
[07:44:44] <socialhapy> â Issue #59 on chosen (tompaton; 9m, 1w ago): Dropdown inside a dialog is hidden (scrolled out of view)
[07:51:44] <dns-away> Ret12, can solved me with it ( http://jsfiddle.net/5Rujj/ ), to show you demo of it what i want.
[07:51:55] <dns-away> There now function not work.
[07:56:07] <Ret12> dns-away: http://jsfiddle.net/5Rujj/2/
[07:57:05] <Ret12> event.preventDefault() is from jQuery and does the same thing as returning false.
[07:57:56] <dns-away> Okay, thanks for now
[07:58:03] <dns-away> Will see it
[07:58:09] <dns-away> :-)
[08:06:02] <aarossig> Does anyone have experience with using autocomplete with key/value pairs?
[08:07:36] <aarossig> I got the auto complete function working on a list of names but I would like to be able to get the id associated with that name
[08:12:43] <dns-away> Ret12, can you check ? http://jsfiddle.net/5Rujj/3/
[08:15:26] <tomoyuki28jp> Question regarding jsrender. How can I define a variable inside a template?
[08:16:29] <simon> I'm toying with this ajax-based multi-document notepad and I want a save button that should take the content of a textarea and save it based on the pad's id... where is a sensible place to store the id... in a global variable?
[08:17:05] <Ret12> dns-away: It seems focusout already fires: http://jsfiddle.net/5Rujj/4/
[08:18:34] <johnkpaul> simon: A global variable would work, but I think that you would be better served by a more modular architecture that separates out your data from the dom
[08:19:14] <dns-away> thanks Ret12
[08:19:59] <simon> johnkpaul, you mean it's a bad idea to use the DOM as my data container...
[08:20:28] <johnkpaul> yes
[08:20:35] <johnkpaul> simon: http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Getting-Truth-Out-of-the-DOM
[08:20:36] <simon> johnkpaul, I agree with you. I'm not sure exactly how I'd achieve that.
[08:20:45] <simon> johnkpaul, thanks.
[08:20:47] <Ret12> simon: HTML5 data-* ...opposite of what johnkpaul is saying, lol. Listen to him.
[08:20:55] <jscoder> jQuery.proxy is pretty much the same as Function.prototype.bind right?
[08:21:13] <johnkpaul> jscoder: pretty much, yes, but there are some differences that I don't know off the top of my head
[08:22:03] <johnkpaul> ?proxy
[08:22:04] <bot-t> jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[08:22:37] <johnkpaul> jscoder: that has some more details, it has multiple signatures that do different thinghs
[08:22:39] <johnkpaul> things*
[08:23:49] <jscoder> johnkpaul: K. I was just confused because the jQuery source doesn't seem to use Function.prototype.bind.
[08:23:55] <simon> johnkpaul, excellent talk.
[08:24:11] <johnkpaul> simon: yeah, it's a really nice way to think about things
[08:24:26] <johnkpaul> jscoder: yeah, jQuery was started when .bind() was mostly unavailable
[08:29:17] <vdemedes> Hello!
[08:30:22] <vdemedes> Guys, I would love to get your feedback on my latest creation - Jewel. It allows you to manage DOM elements like if they could be ActiveRecord models(ORM-like way). http://github.com/vdemedes/jewel
[08:33:55] <simon> johnkpaul, well, I'd never write back-end code like I'd write front-end code... that itself should tell me something is wrong. ;-)
[08:35:28] <jonno11> Hi, I am currently storing my jQuery DOM references in single vars - I'm trying to organise them into an "Elements" object. Doing it like this doesn't seem to work though http://pastebin.com/zaW3fR2X
[08:35:49] <jonno11> any ideas on where I'm going wrong? I'm sure I'm being stupid somewhere down the line...
[08:36:21] <johnkpaul> simon: yeah :)
[08:37:05] <johnkpaul> jonno11: is that code running after domready?
[08:37:26] <jonno11> it's running in document ready
[08:37:49] <johnkpaul> so what isn't working
[08:37:50] <johnkpaul> ?Demo @jonno11
[08:37:51] <bot-t> jonno11, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:38:12] <jonno11> Will do!
[08:45:53] <bgg> hi, autocomplete (jQueryUI) isn't working in IE, can I ask someone to look at this here? I'm tearing my hair out... :-\
[08:46:27] <tomoyuki28jp> jsrender is the most used jquery template engine?
[08:47:47] <ThrushAAX> bgg: I can take a look
[08:47:50] <bgg> hmm, I guess I'll just ask then... :-p Could someone look at http://boardgamegrabber.com/newdesign/ please? Autocomplete works in Firefox, Chrome and Safari, but not in IE9... What am I doing wrong here? :-|
[08:47:53] <bgg> ah ;)
[08:47:58] <ThrushAAX> though I haven't touched that one in  a while
[08:48:10] <bgg> no problem, any help would be appreciated
[08:48:12] <bgg> I'll brb.
[08:52:59] <jonno11> Can anybody make head or tale of why this isn't working?
[08:53:02] <jonno11> http://jsfiddle.net/yejct/
[08:53:22] <ThrushAAX> bgg: I don't think your js is even being run in IE at all
[08:53:39] <johnkpaul> jonno11: you said it was inside document.ready
[08:53:41] <johnkpaul> it is not
[08:53:47] <heldndd> #xcode
[08:53:51] <johnkpaul> jonno11: http://jsfiddle.net/johnkpaul/yejct/1/
[08:53:54] <heldndd> #ios
[08:54:14] <ThrushAAX> bgg: I think you have the wrong type on the script tag
[08:54:40] <jonno11> johnkpaul: how does that change things?
[08:55:13] <johnkpaul> jonno11: your original code is attempting to look up dom elements before they exist
[08:55:23] <ThrushAAX> bgg: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1288263/why-doesnt-ie8-recognize-type-application-javascript-in-a-script-tag
[08:56:21] <Ret12> bgg: type on the script tag should be text/javascript. Or leave out the type attribute. Also, you should probably have a doctype.
[08:57:01] <jonno11> johnkpaul: Ah right ok, so the lookup happens as I'm assigning it to a variable as opposed to when I try and call a DOM object's method?
[08:57:26] <johnkpaul> no, when you call .hide(), you are calling it on an empty jquery object
[08:57:39] <johnkpaul> because when that jquery object was created, it queried the dom for a non existant element
[08:58:01] <jonno11> okay thanks
[09:03:59] <raj> what can I do to have a textarea start at 1 row and increase as necessary with the text content
[09:04:02] <raj> ?
[09:04:14] <raj> ...and reduce
[09:06:19] <simon> raj, does "start at 1 row" mean "place the cursor at some point in the text"?
[09:06:26] <raj> nope
[09:06:33] <raj> i just mean the height of the textarea
[09:06:40] <simon> oh!
[09:06:40] <raj> since it's usually given in rows, afaik
[09:06:46] <simon> so grow the rows.
[09:07:23] <raj> how?
[09:07:23] <bgg> ThrushAAX: yep, that did the trick! Thanks a million, I would never have figured that out! :D
[09:07:33] <simon> raj, try and search "javascript textarea grow automatically" on google.
[09:08:07] <johnkpaul> ?g javascript textarea grow automatically @ raj
[09:08:08] <bgg> Ret12: same thanks to you, ofcourse ;) And I'll add a doctype indeed.
[09:08:10] <bot-t> raj, Textarea Auto Grow - http://www.cfchris.com/cfchris/index.cfm/2010/5/3/Textarea-Auto-Grow
[09:08:18] <johnkpaul> just for your own edification, simon :)
[09:08:18] <simon> raj, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/988876/jquery-growing-and-shrinking-textarea
[09:09:21] <raj> johnkpaul, is height preferred over the rows attribute?
[09:09:37] <raj> or no difference
[09:09:59] <simon> raj, http://javascriptly.com/examples/jquery-grab-bag/autogrow-textarea.html
[09:10:12] <johnkpaul> raj: I think that there's some old browsers that didn't allow css width and height to work with textareas
[09:10:31] <raj> simon, yes, I saw that
[09:11:06] <raj> simon, as soon as you start typing in that, its height nudges a pixel or so larger
[09:11:15] <bgg> ThrushAAX, Ret12: Hmm, the autocomplete is now working, yet the "dropdown" is smaller than the textbox... This is again different from Firefox, Chrome and Safari, where it takes the exact width of the textbox... Any ideas on that one? (stupid IE :-\)
[09:12:40] <GhostCat> Hi, I'm trying to use set TipTip to randomize its default tooltip position on enter
[09:13:03] <GhostCat> I did $('.myElement').tipTip({enter:function(elem,title){ $myContainer.defaultPosition="top"; }}
[09:13:14] <GhostCat> Does anyone know why this is broken?
[09:14:02] <GhostCat> (There is a ); on the end of that, I forgot to copy)
[09:14:07] <bgg> ThrushAAX, Ret12: disregard, adding a doctype fixed that... sorry! (stupid me, so it seems :-\)
[09:14:32] <johnkpaul> ?teach helpfulhelp http://guipn.com/blog/how-to-get-helpful-help/
[09:14:34] <bot-t> johnkpaul, Couldn't find "teach helpfulhelp http://guipn.com/blog/how-to-get-helpful-help/" in jQuery Docs.
[09:15:41] <bgg> ThrushAAX, Ret12: Um, hold on... This now works locally, but not on the server? Ehh... ?!
[09:17:53] <raj> what's wrong with this? http://jsfiddle.net/tPbKy/
[09:22:30] <shoky> rajjjjj
[09:22:58] <shoky> raj: autogrow autoGrow
[09:23:13] <raj> ah crap
[09:23:20] <raj> thanks :)
[09:23:25] <shoky> supp
[09:23:51] <raj> just coding away :)
[09:24:07] <shoky> yeehaww
[09:24:21] <shoky> cute autogrow. you made?
[09:24:27] <raj> i wish
[09:24:38] <raj> no clue how to write a plugin
[09:24:46] <raj> http://javascriptly.com/examples/jquery-grab-bag/autogrow-textarea.html
[09:24:55] <shoky> aw man it's simple as shits, just take a look at your fiddle
[09:25:08] <shoky> there's no such thing as a plugin
[09:25:12] <shoky> it's just a function
[09:25:20] <shoky> like any other function
[09:25:30] <shoky> autogrow(), in this case
[09:25:49] <shoky> well, a method
[09:26:22] <raj> so just define the function as the variable $.fn.whatever
[09:26:37] <raj> and make sure to return `this` at the end?
[09:26:37] <shoky> yes
[09:26:46] <shoky> yeah if you want it to be chainable
[09:26:58] <shoky> $.fn === $.prototype
[09:27:00] <raj> ohh, nice
[09:27:13] <shoky> which is just the place to put methods for jquery objects/collections
[09:27:50] <raj> k, nice
[09:27:55] <raj> what's with (options) ?
[09:28:05] <raj> not used in this case
[09:28:12] <shoky> yea it's not used here
[09:28:13] <raj> ?
[09:28:15] <raj> ok
[09:28:21] <PhonicUK> is anyone else having issues with $(window).resize ?
[09:28:21] <shoky> but its just the options object you can pass to the function
[09:28:33] <PhonicUK> as soon as it fires I get this error:
[09:28:33] <PhonicUK> Uncaught TypeError: Object true has no method 'apply'
[09:28:39] <raj> shoky, understood
[09:28:40] <PhonicUK> no code gets to run, it just bombs immediately
[09:28:49] <raj> any idea what `shadow` is about?
[09:29:25] <shoky> raj make me a plugin that i run on a text input, that changes the background color of the input to whatever color i type in
[09:29:32] <shoky> NoW!
[09:29:42] <raj> ayeaye
[09:29:46] <shoky> YeY
[09:33:30] <shoky> raj that plugin makes a 'shadow' div offscreen , into which it copies the textarea text, for calculating the required new height of the textarea
[09:35:21] <fomatin> hey, i'm making a crappy twitter clone and I'm trying to parse all the links like if @name is in a tweet, then there would be a prepended '<a href="/user/name">' and an appended '</a>'

[09:39:25] <johnkpaul> ah, then you're going to hae some learning to do
[09:39:27] <johnkpaul> ?learn @fomatin
[09:39:28] <bot-t> fomatin, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[09:39:41] <johnkpaul> ?g mdn regular expressions @fomatin

[09:39:43] <fomatin> thanks!
[09:39:46] <johnkpaul> no problem
[09:40:03] <raj> yay http://jsfiddle.net/UES9C/5/
[09:43:52] <shoky> raj awesome :))
[09:45:17] <raj> shoky, any idea why there's a pixel (or so) change in height when typing begins? http://jsfiddle.net/tPbKy/1/
[09:45:45] <shoky> even works on multiple fields - http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/UES9C/6/
[09:49:08] <shoky> fixed it: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/tPbKy/3/
[09:49:43] <shoky> it's cause the shadow div's height is different when its empty vs nonempty
[09:49:57] <shoky> so i just made it nonempty to begin with
[09:50:18] <shoky> (put a 'Z' in it if the textarea is empty)
[09:50:56] <shoky> ah but then if you just enter a space ' ', then it goes up a pixel again
[09:51:41] <raj> nice catch
[09:52:36] <shoky> but
[09:52:52] <shoky> that's fixed too: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/tPbKy/5/
[09:53:57] <shoky> and thanks to that i've learned of $.trim
[09:53:59] <shoky> so . thanks.
[09:54:12] <raj> haha, my pleasure =P
[09:54:18] <shoky> ;D
[09:54:33] <raj> how can it start with a height of 1 row, or whatever the .height() equivalent of that is
[09:54:47] <shoky> what do you mean
[09:56:34] <raj> like http://jsfiddle.net/QW773/
[09:56:56] <shoky> oh
[10:03:24] <shoky> mm its a start http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/tPbKy/6/
[10:05:25] <shoky> and there's this http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/tPbKy/7/
[10:05:37] <shoky> but it doesnt update the height until you type something on the new line
[10:06:04] <iamntz> hey guys, i kinda did a jquery plugin for triggering css keyframes js events http://www.iamntz.com/3157/ what do you think? :)
[10:08:45] <shoky> raj how's this http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/tPbKy/8/
[10:09:37] <christo_m> systemfault: hey mann
[10:09:49] <systemfault> christo_m: 'sup?
[10:09:53] <christo_m> best buddy over heree
[10:09:57] <christo_m> got a problem for you hahah
[10:10:03] <systemfault> :'(
[10:10:12] <christo_m> http://platform.fatsecret.com/api/Default.aspx?screen=rapiauth
[10:10:16] <raj> shoky, can it be prevented from adding an extra blank line under the line currently being written?
[10:10:17] <christo_m> using this api, its RESTful
[10:10:25] <christo_m> but i need to prepend a bunch of oauth params.
[10:10:28] <christo_m> im doing it manually like so
[10:10:32] <christo_m> ill jfiddle it
[10:10:44] <raj> it does that after the first 3 lines
[10:11:13] <shoky> mm it doesnt do that fo rme
[10:12:43] <christo_m> systemfault: http://jsfiddle.net/bcpqR/2/
[10:12:55] <christo_m> systemfault: to me the URL looks exactly like what the API doc says, about appending the normalized params
[10:14:05] <raj> shoky, like sometimes, while typing, it'll just pop a new blank line at the bottom in anticipation
[10:14:55] <shoky> mmm i dont see it
[10:15:05] <shoky> btw bit nicer with overflow:hidden - http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/tPbKy/9/
[10:15:51] <raj> hmm, what's that do?
[10:15:53] <systemfault> christo_m: Hmm, give me 2-3 minutes, I never had to authenticate on a oauth api before.
[10:16:24] <shoky> it makes the scrollbar not flash when new line is added
[10:16:43] <raj> ah, I didn't even notice that :)
[10:17:18] <shoky> hmm it stops workin too good when i add many lines
[10:17:29] <shoky> not all the text fits
[10:17:33] <systemfault> christo_m: Now it complains that the oath_signature is missing
[10:17:56] <shoky> dont really like that 'shadow div' solution
[10:17:56] <raj> yeah, good call
[10:18:38] <raj> doing the calculation directly on the textarea instead?
[10:19:07] <systemfault> christo_m: Ah.. fuck.
[10:19:25] <systemfault> christo_m: I don't think you can communicate with that API using a browser.
[10:19:52] <johnkpaul> you cannot use oauth from the client side alone
[10:21:08] <zykes-> in a onclick is there a way to get it to open a url in the same tab instead of window.open() ?
[10:21:20] <christo_m> johnkpaul: so basically scrap a mobile idea.
[10:21:30] <christo_m> unless i have my own intermediate server fetching the requests.
[10:21:32] <johnkpaul> christo_m: mobile only? yes
[10:21:33] <k1ng> Ìû
[10:21:35] <christo_m> and giving them to the client
[10:21:37] <johnkpaul> phonegap can do it
[10:21:43] <christo_m> im on phonegap.
[10:21:48] <christo_m> theres a plugin or something?
[10:21:55] <johnkpaul> no, I looked for a plugin forever
[10:21:57] <johnkpaul> and didnt find one
[10:22:00] <shoky> raj yea or a 'shadow' textarea i guess
[10:22:49] <johnkpaul> christo_m: you can write it yourself though
[10:23:05] <christo_m> johnkpaul: mind if i take a peek at what youve done already :P
[10:23:17] <christo_m> i dont want to write an oauth layer right now hha
[10:23:40] <johnkpaul> christo_m: I didn't do it that way in the end
[10:23:56] <johnkpaul> I just used django social registration on the server side
[10:24:30] <christo_m> johnkpaul: ya i dont really want any servers involved here
[10:24:35] <christo_m> except for the fatsecret one
[10:24:43] <k1ng> Ìû
[10:24:48] <christo_m> okay thats the second API ive had to scrap, running out of them here boys
[10:24:58] <johnkpaul> christo_m: you don't _have_ to scrap it
[10:25:04] <johnkpaul> you just dont' want to write the oauth layer
[10:25:05] <johnkpaul> :)
[10:25:08] <christo_m> johnkpaul: obviously you chose to do it server side for a reason
[10:25:12] <christo_m> because the other route was too complicated :P
[10:25:14] <raj> shoky, what do you mean?
[10:25:23] <christo_m> not impossible, but not a good use of time
[10:25:37] <christo_m> actually.. i might as well try and do it and at least make a plugin so some next bastard doesnt have to deal with this
[10:25:40] <johnkpaul> christo_m: not b ecvause it was too complicated, it's because I had another very fast option
[10:25:52] <johnkpaul> I already had a server side
[10:27:31] <shoky> raj i just meant calculating on a textarea that is offscreen like they did with a div here. but i'd need to sit and fiddle with it to see the best way to do it
[10:32:16] <christo_m> johnkpaul: i dont even know where to start dude
[10:32:18] <christo_m> theres an oauth js lib
[10:32:51] <christo_m> fatsecret.com/crossdomain.xml says all, so i shouldnt have to worry about crosdomain issues like yesterday
[10:33:30] <johnkpaul> you can start here, but I didn't really figure out how it works - https://github.com/drogus/phonegap-oauth
[10:33:44] <johnkpaul> well actually, start here http://oauth.net/about/
[10:33:46] <christo_m> right ive seen this i think
[10:33:50] <christo_m> its the strobe crap right
[10:34:02] <Amplified> Hi guys, I need help with a jQuery script.
[10:34:38] <Amplified> http://jsfiddle.net/R3H9W/1/ <- Can someone skilled check that out and tell me why it isnt working :3
[10:34:39] <johnkpaul> christo_m: I don't know, I didn't understand it to be honest
[10:34:53] <johnkpaul> oauth on it's own isn't _hard_ it's just annoying and complicated
[10:35:15] <johnkpaul> with lots of potential for error
[10:35:18] <johnkpaul> ok fine, it's hard
[10:35:19] <johnkpaul> ;)
[10:36:39] <christo_m> lol..
[10:36:41] <christo_m> scrapppp
[10:37:42] <Amplified> Anyone?
[10:37:44] <johnkpaul> Amplified: $(window).width()
[10:37:47] <johnkpaul> you need the ()
[10:38:17] <johnkpaul> ?eval function(){} <= 480
[10:38:20] <bot-t> johnkpaul: SyntaxError: invalid XML name
[10:38:27] <johnkpaul> ?eval (function(){}) <= 480
[10:38:27] <bot-t> johnkpaul: false

[10:39:59] <xec> :D
[10:40:03] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/4NzfC/47/ in my second $tabs.each(function(), how can I get it to move to the next index (which would grab the next li's data-to-move in an incremental fashion? right now it just goes haywire
[10:40:44] <xec> Amplified: width is a function so you need width()
[10:41:17] <johnkpaul> :) I thought that was what I said
[10:41:50] <xec> yeah but did you see what he tried
[10:42:26] <johnkpaul> yeah, I Know
[10:42:33] <johnkpaul> but it didn't work
[10:42:51] <johnkpaul> ?width @Amplified
[10:42:52] <bot-t> Amplified, .width(): Get the current computed width for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/width/
[10:43:25] <shoky> someprimetime: wha?
[10:43:40] <someprimetime> shoky: how can I get it to time out as it loops through each of those list elements?
[10:43:55] <someprimetime> so i can incrementally have it step to the next one
[10:44:16] <someprimetime> right now it just loops through all of them and grabs the last data-to-move which is where the last panel lives
[10:44:58] <shoky> someprimetime: wha?
[10:45:03] <xec> someprimetime: what are you expecting to happen? a slideshow sort of thing? with a delay?
[10:45:10] <someprimetime> xec: yeah
[10:45:22] <someprimetime> like if you click the dots right now it works as intended
[10:45:25] <someprimetime> i just wanted to automate that
[10:46:41] <shoky> i still have no idea what the question is :S
[10:46:55] <shoky> too much pronouns
[10:46:58] <Amplified> johnkpaul: like this then? http://jsfiddle.net/R3H9W/2/
[10:47:22] <xec> he wants it to spin round (like a record)
[10:47:32] <shoky> maybe, but that's not a question
[10:47:47] <someprimetime> shoky: yeah maybe i should have worded it differently
[10:48:08] <someprimetime> xec got it though
[10:48:51] <xec> i don't quite see how it works though, maybe comment your code a bit
[10:49:12] <shoky> you're setting all the tabs to active?
[10:49:32] <shoky> yea, no idea what's goin on in your code
[10:49:38] <someprimetime> alright let me comment
[10:49:41] <someprimetime> h/o
[10:51:58] <Amplified> Any idea why this: http://jsfiddle.net/R3H9W/2/ Only works in Firefox?
[10:52:20] <someprimetime> Amplified: you know you can add jquery to the left right?
[10:52:33] <shoky> someprimetime: you mean something like this ? http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/4NzfC/48/
[10:52:48] <someprimetime> shoky: damn! nice!
[10:52:50] <shoky> just changed the timeout
[10:52:51] <someprimetime> thanks dude!
[10:52:58] <shoky> heh np
[10:52:58] <someprimetime> oh i*1000
[10:53:01] <someprimetime> clever
[10:53:15] <shoky> basic use of variables. programming 101 :)
[10:53:20] <someprimetime> haha word
[10:53:28] <someprimetime> i'd written a carousel before for work, so i had to come up with a weird method for my personal stuff since i can't re-use any code i do @ work
[10:53:53] <johnkpaul> Amplified: are you checking the console?
[10:53:55] <johnkpaul> that code has errors
[10:54:00] <someprimetime> my old carousel http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/VEkjH/4/
[10:55:14] <Amplified> johnkpaul: Do you mean firebug?
[10:55:43] <johnkpaul> I mean in whatever browser you are using, I didn't check in firebug, but in the webkit dev tools in chrome, I am getting a syntax error
[10:56:13] <RPkS> johnkpaul: My site is running great, but when I installed an extension (Increase Page Speed - Minify, Compress, Combine, Cache Javascript And CSS Scripts) it created a small problem with the vertical carousel I created a couple of weeks ago. This part will be stunning news, ...but I think I've found the problem. :)   I'm hoping you or someone else could take a look at my site without the
[10:56:13] <RPkS> extension and help me confirm that I've found the right issue.
[10:56:51] <johnkpaul> RPkS: if you have found the problem, what are you asking us to do?
[10:57:56] <Amplified> johnkpaul: do you mean the: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL?
[10:58:06] <RPkS> It's a line of javascript ....  $('#carousel94 ul').jcarousel({    There is a div id carousel94 ...but there is no carousel94 ul
[10:58:11] <johnkpaul> yes, Amplified
[10:58:40] <raj> shoky, yeah, unfortunately it definitely doesn't work with wider textarea elements
[10:58:57] <shoky> ;/
[10:59:00] <raj> it just keeps adding line after line every few characters
[10:59:15] <shoky> really
[10:59:18] <shoky> got a fiddle?
[11:00:10] <shoky> nm
[11:00:10] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/tPbKy/10/
[11:01:13] <Amplified> johnkpaul: ok, solved it
[11:01:23] <johnkpaul> great
[11:01:23] <RPkS> IN my case each time I turn the compression extension on bullets show up to the left and a little below the thumbnail images and the carousel container breaks also.
[11:02:03] <shoky> raj i ain't seein da prob
[11:02:10] <raj> can it be determined if the characters entered have reached the end of the line
[11:02:11] <shoky> except the scrollbars
[11:02:21] <raj> shoky, widen the Result box
[11:02:22] <shoky> dunno
[11:02:23] <shoky> oh
[11:03:15] <shoky> still not really seein a prob
[11:03:39] <shoky> ah well it's using the original width
[11:04:07] <raj> oh, that's what it is
[11:05:04] <shoky> fixed that: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/tPbKy/11/
[11:05:13] <shoky> kinda.
[11:09:42] <shoky> neato http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/tPbKy/14/
[11:14:02] <RPkS> Can I talk someone into looking at my issue?
[11:14:12] <shoky> not if you don't say what it is
[11:14:17] <xec> time will tell
[11:15:37] <RPkS> Can I talk someone into looking at my issue?
[11:15:40] <shoky> no
[11:15:44] <shoky> you fail
[11:15:50] <RPkS> oops ...that was a typo
[11:16:08] <RPkS> I pasted a link and accidently hit the up arrow
[11:16:17] <RPkS> https://hiddencameragear.com/cellphone-recon-usb-surveillance-tool
[11:16:49] <RPkS> The image scroller to the left of the product image works fine until I turn the compression extension on
[11:17:30] <shoky> ok?
[11:18:06] <RPkS> There is a script listed under it has the line $('#carousel94 ul').jcarousel({    listed in it
[11:18:23] <RPkS> Let me flip the compression extension on and you can see the problem
[11:18:53] <shoky> what is 'it' ?  both instances
[11:18:59] <RPkS> Now refresh the page
[11:19:41] <shoky> seems like an awesome extension. extension to what ?
[11:19:58] <johnkpaul> :)
[11:20:27] <RPkS> http://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=account/download/info&order_id=154494
[11:20:37] <RPkS> that's the extension ...
[11:20:58] <shoky> i dont have an account..
[11:21:10] <xec> RPkS: the concatenated script file is included after your call to jcarousel
[11:21:11] <RPkS> Increase Page Speed - Minify, Compress, Combine, Cache Javascript And CSS Scripts
[11:21:19] <shoky> extension to what?
[11:21:24] <shoky> what is it extending?
[11:21:29] <RPkS> my shopping cart
[11:21:39] <shoky> what shopping cart
[11:21:42] <RPkS> it compresses everything
[11:21:45] <RPkS> opencart
[11:21:59] <shoky> the problem is with an image slider
[11:22:05] <shoky> not a cart. yes ?
[11:22:20] <xec> shoky: the problem is created by the concatenation on server side
[11:22:28] <RPkS> the link to my site is above ....yes it breaks the vertical scroller to the left of the product image
[11:22:45] <xec> RPkS: like i said already: the concatenated script file is included after your call to jcarousel
[11:22:51] <xec> no wonder it's not working
[11:22:52] <RPkS> xec: I'm not sure what that means
[11:22:58] <shoky> xec: the main problem is not knowing to express himself. i'm trying to work on that ;)
[11:23:23] <xec> you're doing .jcarousel() before the plugin code is included on the page
[11:23:30] <RPkS> I have no shortage of words, I just don't know all the lingo I need to. LOL
[11:23:57] <shoky> another way of saying you have a shortage of words ;)
[11:24:16] <xec> theres a word for that.... what was it again
[11:24:21] <shoky> HeeHee
[11:24:24] <RPkS> So I would need to move the script above the jcarousel
[11:25:00] <xec> RPkS: you're talking about two scripts, both have to do with jcarousel, so i dont know which you mean
[11:25:21] <xec> obviously, you need the plugin included before you use it, right?
[11:25:40] <RPkS> Well I'll admit to ignorance, but ignorance of subject matter doesn't equal stupidity.
[11:25:59] <shoky> no one said you're stupid. you seem far from it
[11:26:03] <RPkS> xec: that makes perfect sense
[11:26:12] <xec> RPkS: noone is saying you're stupid, we're just saying it's hard to understand you
[11:26:23] <RPkS> Well I said that with a smile on my face shoky. LOL
[11:26:34] <shoky> we're all smiles here ;)
[11:26:40] <xec> grouphug!!!
[11:26:45] <shoky> omg0sh
[11:27:11] <RPkS> That;s the problem with the typed word it sits there... alone, needing more. LOL
[11:28:05] <shoky> fucken letters
[11:28:21] <xec> hoo needsem
[11:28:46] <shoky> nohbadi
[11:29:12] <xec> dasrite
[11:29:51] <RPkS> wedontneednostinkinskoolin
[11:30:02] <xec> anyway... RPkS: what happens if you move the script block with your .jcarousel() call to, say, the end of <body>
[11:30:12] <PhonicUK> hey everyone
[11:30:42] <PhonicUK> I take it you've all seen Alpine by now? ;)
[11:30:52] <xec> is it a movie?
[11:30:53] <shoky> hey Phonic who is making a jquery GUI VB-style builder and has new videos of it everyday for all to see
[11:31:01] <PhonicUK> xD
[11:31:23] <PhonicUK> xec, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4mhmeCLoFU :P
[11:31:38] <PhonicUK> shoky, indeed! new one tomorrow with any luck :P
[11:32:07] <RPkS> xec: it's not a movie, it's an extension. ;)
[11:32:24] <shoky> of our brains
[11:32:31] <xec> mmmmmmm braaaaaaaains
[11:32:33] <PhonicUK> into the interwebs!
[11:32:42] <PhonicUK> Alpine = brain + interwebs
[11:32:45] <shoky> just double click the brains and you can edit its function()
[11:32:45] <xec> PhonicUK: hey thats pretty sweet
[11:32:51] <PhonicUK> yup
[11:33:09] <PhonicUK> the toolboxes are docked now by default instead of floating
[11:33:18] <shoky> exciting
[11:33:18] <xec> maybe i can make my mom do my javascripts from now on
[11:33:44] <shoky> only if she pays for 24/7 support from Phonic
[11:33:50] <PhonicUK> lol
[11:34:28] <PhonicUK> it was tweeted by jquery addict earlier
[11:34:30] <PhonicUK> which was kinda cool
[11:34:32] <RPkS> xec: I moved it up the page above the carousel and that didn't fix anything ....in fact now it doesn't work with the extension turned off
[11:34:51] <xec> RPkS: what did you move
[11:36:07] <xec> specifically, what is "it"and what is "the carousel", seeing as they can be referring to the plugin, the script calling the plugin, or the dom element with the carousel id
[11:36:08] <RPkS> <!-- $('#carousel94 ul').jcarousel({   vertical: true,  visible: 4,  wrap: 'circular',  scroll: 3  });  //-->
[11:36:42] <xec> what is this html comment business, netscape compatibility?
[11:36:55] <RPkS> http://puu.sh/thWm    This is the carousel
[11:37:03] <shoky> heh
[11:37:20] <RPkS> You can see that it's broken and spilling outside of it's container
[11:37:35] <xec> RPkS: ok. where is the jcarousel plugin code included?
[11:38:05] <RPkS> I just didn;'t put the  <script type="text/javascript">    part at the front of it
[11:38:29] <xec> you don't need that type="" business either
[11:38:53] <xec> <script>$('#carousel94 ul').jcarousel(.....)</script> is sufficient
[11:39:15] <RPkS> I am only using this carousel on my product pages, so I placed it in my Product.tpl file
[11:39:31] <xec> i will refer to this code as ".jcarousel()" or "the call" from now on
[11:39:48] * shoky witness
[11:39:56] <zykes-> 1what pwhat app is that ?
[11:40:01] <zykes-> RPkS: ?
[11:40:03] <xec> or i might even throw you a curveball and call it "the .jcarousel() call"
[11:40:16] <RPkS> I see, so should I have left it below the UL and changed the style or move it above?
[11:40:18] <shoky> let it be known
[11:40:53] <xec> RPkS: the call needs to be either inside a doc ready or after the element in the dom structure
[11:41:00] <xec> thats step one
[11:41:06] <RPkS> zykes-: ...What app? Are you asking about the product, the carousel or what?
[11:41:15] <shoky> 1what pwhat
[11:41:45] <xec> RPkS: when that is done, make sure the plugin code is included *before* this call
[11:42:09] * RPkS feels ashamed to admit he doesn't know exactly what xec is saying to do
[11:42:29] <xec> RPkS: it's ok - what part didn't you understand so far
[11:42:48] <shoky> much better to admit it than to pretend you understand
[11:43:17] <xec> shoky: i'll pretend i understand what you meant by that
[11:43:25] <RPkS> "either inside a doc" or after the DOM structure
[11:43:51] <shoky> ill admit you're being rather pretentious
[11:44:18] <xec> shoky: what is this long word?!
[11:44:37] <shoky> pre-tent-iou-s
[11:44:42] <xec> RPkS: a doc ready event is $(document).ready(function(){ /* my code here will be executed after DOM is ready */ });
[11:44:44] <shoky> something about camping?!?!
[11:44:48] <RPkS> Is this correct? http://puu.sh/ti2n
[11:44:50] <xec> yeah, i know about tents
[11:45:03] <shoky> the zipper confuses me
[11:45:35] <xec> shoky: indeed, i find it easiest to just bite a hole and stick my head out, then wear the tent as a body suit
[11:46:09] <shoky> niceeee, i always just waited it out
[11:46:37] <shoky> but tent-suit is elegant. you could be a superhero
[11:47:09] <xec> RPkS: the snippet looks allrigt, depending on where in the html it is
[11:48:19] <xec> RPkS: what i mean by "doc ready" is explained in detail here: http://docs.jquery.com/How_jQuery_Works#Launching_Code_on_Document_Ready
[11:49:19] <RPkS> Well I put it below the ul and refreshed the page ....it worked perfectly. Until I turned the compression extension on, then it went crazy again.
[11:50:01] <xec> ok is it included after the carousel html elements on the live site now?
[11:50:21] <RPkS> yes it is
[11:51:05] <wissem_> hello
[11:51:24] <wissem_> I'm using the .post to send some data
[11:51:29] <xec> ok i see it
[11:51:33] <RPkS> xec: I am worried that I have made an error with the way set the carousel up. It might be pulling from carousel.css or jcarousel.css OR my styles.css.
[11:51:40] <wissem_> but it looks like it insert the "?" in the url by default
[11:51:47] <wissem_> can I change that?
[11:54:00] <RPkS> xec: if you use firebug you can select ul class="jcarousel-skin-opencart" and then hover over the style in the right pane that is numbered index...sel.css 438 and see the HUGE line that popes up
[11:54:28] <Whirl3d> if an input element inside a form has focus, is there a selector for the form that's easy or should I write a custom selector for :focus that "bubbles" the focus to the form?
[11:55:20] <Whirl3d> I suppose I could use $("input:focus").closest('form')
[11:55:21] <xec> RPkS: you know what, it's not just the order like i assumed it might be
[11:55:46] <RPkS> yes?
[11:55:58] <xec> RPkS: even doing $("#carousel94 ul").jcarousel(); in the console throws the same error: .jcarousel is not a function
[11:56:16] <xec> meaning your minifier is buggering up the plugin code
[11:56:22] <RPkS> THis is the massive link that has all of the code being compressed. Please excuse it's size
[11:56:24] <RPkS> https://hiddencameragear.com/min/index.php?b=catalog/view&f=theme/sportstore/stylesheet/styles.css,theme/sportstore/js/jquery/ui/themes/ui-lightness/jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.css,javascript/jquery/fancybox/jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.css,theme/sportstore/stylesheet/jcarousel.css,theme/sportstore/stylesheet/nivo-slider.css,theme/default/stylesheet/improved_search_v14x.css,theme/default/stylesheet/impr
[11:56:24] <RPkS> oved_search.css,theme/default/stylesheet/carousel.css
[11:56:36] <BigWings> if I append a div to another element using .append(newdiv)   then whats the best way to refer to the newly appended div?
[11:57:07] <xec> BigWings: you seem to already have a reference in newdiv?
[11:57:41] <RPkS> xec: you can see that it has jcarousel.css   carousel.css and my styles.css file in that link
[11:57:45] <systemfault> BigWings: You need a variable.
[11:57:51] <BigWings> xec,  yeah but if im making multiple copies, then how do i differenttiate?
[11:58:06] <systemfault> BigWings: var div = $('<div />'); container.append(div);
[11:58:13] <xec> RPkS: css is not the issue, you're getting js errors
[11:58:28] <BigWings> hmm lets try
[11:58:50] <RPkS> xec: very well, I just want to take whatever blame I may have caused into question first.
[12:01:03] <Whirl3d> If I am animating an element and I create a deferred object to be resolved when the animation completes and store it in the element's data object so that when the animation is complete, the deferred is resolved, can I use removeData(deferred) without destroying the attached callbacks or should I wait for a second or two before removing data?
[12:02:13] <xec> RPkS: it's definetely the minifier extension buggering things up, i can't see exactly what it's doing wrong though
[12:02:56] <RPkS> I have to call BS on ME ....I can see that I have code doubled up with my stlyes.css and carousel.css ....all of the .jcarousel-skin-opencart  styles are listed in both of those style sheets! That has to be part of the problem... surely.
[12:04:04] <RPkS> hey, I don't enjoy telling on mkyself, but you're trying to help me, so you deserve for me to share any mistakes I am bringing to the table.
[12:04:07] <xec> RPkS: nop it's pretty clear that the js plugin itself is not working. do you have a console?
[12:04:23] <xec> what browser are you using?
[12:05:15] <RPkS> firefox
[12:06:04] <xec> do you have firebug installed?
[12:06:08] <RPkS> yes
[12:06:13] <tw2113> like a boss
[12:06:18] <xec> ok open it and click the console tab
[12:06:20] <RPkS> I do have it installed ....I use contantly
[12:06:23] <xec> then refresh the page
[12:06:41] <xec> do you see any errors?
[12:06:57] <RPkS> Yes I see 2 errors
[12:07:47] <RPkS> http://puu.sh/tijO
[12:07:57] <xec> and the second one is complaining about what
[12:08:56] <RPkS> about #jcarousel ul not being a function
[12:08:57] <tw2113> taxes, xec
[12:09:17] <xec> death!
[12:09:20] <wissem_> is there a way to use the .post and pass parmeter without adding the "?"
[12:09:23] <wissem_> ?
[12:09:25] <shoky> Whirl3d: i dont see why removing the data from the DOM element should have any effect ?
[12:09:38] <RPkS> no, that's MY job to complain about taxes ....assuming I ever make any money with this business. LOL
[12:09:50] <xec> RPkS: no its complaining that .jcarousel is not a function
[12:09:52] <tw2113> they'll tax you even if you don't
[12:10:02] <Whirl3d> Cool. I was just trying to setup a test bed for it
[12:10:02] <RPkS> Ture Dat
[12:10:19] <RPkS> xec: I am 100% aware that I don
[12:10:31] <xec> you don?
[12:10:33] <shoky> Whirl3d: but what do you mean by removeData(deferred)
[12:10:38] <RPkS> xec: I am 100% aware that I don't have a jcarousel ul in my stylesheets
[12:10:48] <xec> its a javascript console
[12:11:01] <xec> css is not gonna complain
[12:11:21] <shoky> (it should)
[12:11:58] <xec> RPkS: look on the right hand side, it's even referring to a line number
[12:12:08] <xec> click it
[12:12:11] <xec> i dare you
[12:12:23] <xec> i double-dare you motherfucker
[12:12:55] <xec> (hehe no offence, in case you're not a pulp fiction fan)
[12:13:06] <RPkS> oh yes I see that it's the line I changed earlier
[12:13:16] <RPkS> Nah, I'm laughing with you
[12:13:32] <shoky> btw- if you havent seen it yet, in chrome scripts tab you can now ctrl-shift-f to search ALL loaded scripts
[12:13:34] <shoky> at least in chrome dev
[12:13:38] <xec> yes, and that exact same line is working when the minifier extension is not running, am i right?
[12:13:40] <shoky> vry useful
[12:13:59] <xec> +1 street creds to shoky for random protip
[12:14:02] <RPkS> yes, I believe it is
[12:14:05] <shoky> heh
[12:14:22] <shoky> i'll hand that cred to paul_irish
[12:14:38] <tw2113> anti-pattern of the week?
[12:14:42] <xec> :D
[12:15:05] <xec> i can't belieive noone has made a song about that yet
[12:15:08] <RPkS> I turned the extension off and the carousel works again
[12:15:13] <shoky> heh  he has a new neat presentation up
[12:15:27] <shoky> learned it from there
[12:15:33] <xec> oh wait! http://jonneal.bandcamp.com/track/paul-irishs-jquery-anti-pattern-for-performance-of-the-week
[12:16:21] <shoky> ;)
[12:16:52] <xec> RPkS: i suggest you find another minifier or don't do it
[12:16:55] <RPkS> LOL
[12:17:07] <shoky> ;D
[12:17:27] <xec> just say NO to drugs. and bad minifiers
[12:17:43] <shoky> mostly to bad minifiers
[12:17:44] <RPkS> Ok, I know the guy who wrote it ...well I deal with him a decent bit. Is there anyway to help him, help me?
[12:17:52] <xec> yeah, drugs can be awesome
[12:18:06] <RPkS> That's only temporary
[12:18:18] <shoky> like life
[12:18:27] <xec> yeah but bad minifiers are permanent
[12:18:32] <shoky> ;DS:dS:DS:dS:DD:D
[12:20:10] <tw2113> like tramp stamps and politicians
[12:23:47] <RPkS> xec: I pulled a couple stylesheets that are of ZERO importance off my server. (I made copies, I'm not completely insane, at least not yet.)
[12:31:01] <Goopyo> can someone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/gvFRW/ I want it to grab the new image and while its laoding the new image replace the old one with a loading gif, then finally when its loaded replace the image. This script currently works but it seems to be loading the image twice instead of once.
[12:35:45] <Mekzholan1> Hi, I've got HTML that looks like <div id="x">-</div> or <div id="x"><div>..</div></div> and thus a JS variable $x=$('#x') as well as an other JS variable $n=$('<div>new</div>') - how can I replace the internal "-" or "<div>..</div>" with $n?
[12:36:14] <Mekzholan1> The result should then be <div id="x"><div>new</div></div> of course...
[12:36:26] <xec> ?html @ Mekzholan1
[12:36:26] <bot-t> Mekzholan1, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[12:37:05] <xec> i believe $("#x").html($n) should do the trick?
[12:38:03] <Mekzholan1> well ja, .html() could work
[12:38:16] <Mekzholan1> but do I create a copy of the DOM node?
[12:38:31] <Mekzholan1> I prefere not to, as this will occur many times in the page...
[12:38:43] <mutedb> I got this bug with slidetoggle, when I toggle a div and then click a button in it, if I press the back button on the page I redirected to land back on the page with the slidetoggle div I've got a bug
[12:39:03] <xec> actually, i'm not entirely sure you can slap the jquery object in the html() call
[12:39:04] <mutedb> it either just animates and doesn'T toggle back to hidden
[12:39:49] <mutedb> or toggles back and forth and resets
[12:40:02] <zykes-> RPkS: yeh the carousel
[12:40:46] <Mekzholan1> xec: it worked - but I'm still unsure about not having a reference
[12:41:04] <xec> Mekzholan1: maybe see ?clone
[12:41:04] <bot-t> Mekzholan1, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[12:41:30] <someprimetime> man it's such a nice day out (bay area CA)
[12:42:25] <Mekzholan1> xec: well, I do NOT want to do a deep copy. I want a reference...
[12:42:52] <xec> o.O
[12:43:08] <xec> you said you wanted a copy of the dom node
[12:43:42] <Mekzholan1> no, I said "I prefere not to".. :)
[12:43:53] <xec> ahh
[12:44:32] <xec> well, you could .empty() and then .append()
[12:44:43] <xec> instead of .html() i mean
[12:46:05] <Mekzholan1> xec: thanks, that sounds like a plan!
[12:47:21] <atxq> I have the same $(".class").click twice on the same page. currently when I click on .class, the script runs twice. how can I cick on .class and run the script once, and then exit?
[13:03:18] <shoky> don't bind the click handler twice
[13:03:22] <Mekzholan1> different question: Let's have x=['a',$('<div>x</div>'),'b'] - is there a way to have one jQ-Object that contains this as DOM element? I.e. it shoudl be equal to $('a<div>x</div>b')
[13:04:44] <gf3> Mekzholan1: You could try creating text elements and then wrapping them w/ jQ
[13:04:47] <gf3> I've never tried it
[13:05:31] <shoky> $('a<div>x</div>b') ?
[13:05:42] <shoky> the a and b are ignored
[13:06:10] <xec> you need a root element, so just wrap it in something
[13:06:10] <atxq> http://jsfiddle.net/VJcLX/1/
[13:06:11] <Mekzholan1> gf3: well, it's related to the question above: the <div> (ok, in my case an <img>) is used multiple times on the page and I'd love it to be a reference and not a copy...
[13:06:50] <gf3> Mekzholan1: Soâ¦ just reference it?
[13:07:15] <delinquentme> im using chrome ... and for some reason I  cant get the console to find a id which I've verified as existing
[13:07:20] <delinquentme> $('#wrapper')
[13:07:27] <delinquentme> wrapper is the ID of the element
[13:07:28] <delinquentme> wtf.
[13:07:31] <shoky> atxq: you can do: $('.a').off('click')
[13:08:00] <atxq> .off would cancel the second script from running?
[13:08:12] <shoky> it would cancel both
[13:08:33] <Mekzholan1> gf3: how can I reference it when it gets "destroyed" by being converted to a String and then recreated?
[13:08:46] <gf3> Wha?
[13:09:06] <gf3> var div = document.createElement("div");
[13:09:21] <shoky> atxq: maybe you wanna use event namespaces
[13:09:33] <Mekzholan1> xec: ok, let's say I'll put a dummy <div> around it. Is there a jQ command that attaches text and jQ-DOM-Elements in an array to one parent?
[13:09:46] <shoky> so that you can selectively unbind your handlers
[13:09:51] <delinquentme> Does chrome not support jquery selectors??
[13:10:05] <shoky> or just use your own custom events
[13:10:08] <Mekzholan1> xec or do I have to iterate "manually"?
[13:10:16] <shoky> delinquentme: it does if you include jquery
[13:10:42] <delinquentme> ohhhh
[13:10:48] <delinquentme> how do I do this?
[13:10:58] <atxq> I am loading the same file twice in different places on the page, so I was hoping to run the script once and cancel all other instances from running
[13:11:01] <shoky> you read how to do it on jquery.com ?
[13:11:03] <delinquentme> I guess it only loads / runs the particular JS lib which the page is currently running?
[13:11:05] <tw2113> nargles
[13:11:21] <tw2113> atxq why not just load the file once?
[13:11:40] <atxq> I was hoping there was something in jquery like stopPropagation, but for this situation?
[13:11:40] <shoky> delinquentme: yes
[13:12:24] <atxq> the file that I am loading twice is a menu file, once in the mainmenu and then again on the sidebar
[13:13:15] <shoky> it shouldn't bind on $('.a') then, if there is another menu with '.a' elements
[13:13:26] <atxq> figre I ask here before I rewrite the whole script again
[13:14:14] <atxq> when I click the link in the menu, the same both scripts runs so on the page
[13:14:35] <shoky> each of the menus code should only bind with selectors for its own elements
[13:15:16] <shoky> like.. $('#mainMenu .a').click(.......)
[13:15:21] <shoky> or someth.
[13:15:23] <tw2113> ^
[13:15:29] <tw2113> sounds like you're not getting specific enough :D
[13:16:29] <atxq> the would be the correct way to fix this issue, but seems like I cannot define the parent id at the present moment, only the class
[13:17:02] <tw2113> then use the class and make them different
[13:17:13] <tw2113> you'll lose some efficiency, but it'd get the job done
[13:17:43] <atxq> I was thinking jst now to add an if statement to check the parent id first, then proceed to execute
[13:18:12] <tw2113> whatever gets the job done
[13:23:06] <muhoo> ugh, jquery ui tabs will push the content below ANYTHING that is in the left column outside the tab
[13:23:21] <muhoo> so iiend up with a menu that's 600px tall :-(
[13:23:28] <muhoo> damn css
[13:23:38] <tw2113> first you blame jquery ui, then you blame css
[13:23:54] <tw2113> :)
[13:24:15] <muhoo> is it even possible to have a sidebar on the left, outside of a jquery ui tab widget?
[13:24:36] <muhoo> tw2113: would you have expected something like this to happen? it is not what i'd expect.
[13:25:11] <systemfault> I don't always blame jQueryUIâ¦ but when I doâ¦ I blame its CSS
[13:25:13] <tw2113> dunno, never used jquery ui much
[13:25:20] <muhoo> if i'm doing something obviously stupid, pelase let me know
[13:25:26] <muhoo> or if this isn't supported
[13:26:47] <muhoo> hmm, maybe jquery ui is the wrong tool for the job
[13:28:51] <someprimetime> muhoo: jquery ui is rather bloated for most things
[13:29:00] <someprimetime> i prefer to just roll my own tbh
[13:29:07] <someprimetime> (in more ways than one ;) )
[13:29:31] <someprimetime> with that, i'm out
[13:31:28] <muhoo> i'm starting to agree. i need to integrate some custom "corporate identity" css crap, and i suspect it's not going to play well with jqueryui
[13:31:44] <ajpiano> yo a css bug is a css bug
[13:31:52] <ajpiano> use your developer tools and figure out what the conflit is
[13:32:01] <raj> shoky, still around?
[13:32:25] <muhoo> doesn't seem like it'd be too hard to just have a set of regular menus, and just xhr in the content manualy using jquery
[13:32:37] <ajpiano> the idea that jquery ui is going to be magically incompatible with your setup because at the moment you have some layout error that could be entirely unrelated does doesn't jibe with reality
[13:32:58] <ajpiano> but if something simpler than the full fledged tabs works for your app that is fine as well
[13:33:11] <raj> ajpiano, thanks, I always thought it was 'jive with reality'
[13:33:23] <muhoo> i'm just trying to reduce the frustration factor somewhat.
[13:33:25] <ajpiano> raj :)
[13:33:37] <muhoo> simpler  is generally good for that.
[13:34:13] <muhoo> i do not fully understand jqueryui tabs, therefore, when tthere is breakage like this, i'm kind of lost.
[13:34:33] <ajpiano> either show a live demo of it breaking at jsfiddle.net or your live site
[13:34:41] <ajpiano> or use the development tools in your browser
[13:34:47] <ajpiano> to inspect the elements that are misbehaving
[13:36:02] <muhoo> got it. been staring at firebug for a while nw.
[13:36:42] <muhoo> where it decided to make the menu 688 pixels high, i can't seem to determine
[13:36:43] <TAiS46> hey, can someone tell me, why serialize() wont work? http://jsfiddle.net/sUKQL/
[13:41:44] <muhoo> ajpiano: hahaa, margin-bottom: -600px , "fixed" :-) thanks
[13:42:02] <ajpiano> :)
[13:42:34] <ajpiano> TAiS46: your elements don't have name attribute
[13:43:22] <TAiS46> ajpiano: thank you .. i am blind ..
[13:51:23] <Shubuntu> is there a way to make a progress bar using jquery / ajax / php if i have fcgid enabled?
[14:14:48] <shoky> raj yea
[14:14:59] <raj> aah, nice
[14:15:28] <raj> shoky, perhaps you can tell me why the difference btwn the textarea beside Business Address 'grows' correctly (javascript), and the textarea at the top of the page (once you click Click Me) grows inappropriately. It has to do with display:block vs display:inline (inline works as expected) --> http://68.46.138.78:8080/testsingleupload
[14:15:44] <raj> you can see it growing inappropriately if you just type "h a h a h a ..." or so into each box
[14:18:17] <shoky> if you resize the window it works :P
[14:18:31] <shoky> its cause that textarea isn't visible when calling the .autogrow()
[14:18:43] <shoky> i think
[14:19:38] <raj> well, it shows up in a dialog
[14:19:43] <raj> i just updated it
[14:21:02] <shoky> because it's not visible, it's .width() is 0
[14:21:09] <shoky> so the 'shadow' div also gets width 0

[14:27:08] <shoky> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/tPbKy/16/
[14:27:35] <shoky> now it updates the shadow's width
[14:36:23] <multiHYP> hi
[14:36:32] <multiHYP> what can I use instead of find()?
[14:36:50] <multiHYP> I know the tag and is unique, so just something like get() would be enough

[14:39:46] <raj> jquery-ui
[14:41:56] <PhonicUK> I'm having a hard time getting jQuery to properly serialize an array of objects
[14:42:02] <PhonicUK> when objects contain arrays, it won't go any deeper
[14:42:09] <PhonicUK> i want to serialize some data into a lump of JSON
[14:47:30] <shoky> huh
[14:47:42] <shoky> ?eval JSON.stringify([{a: [{b: 5}, {b: 7}], d: 20}, 50])
[14:48:13] * raj please wait while we process your request
[14:48:41] <shoky> it give eror

[14:50:36] <raj> it's raj-san
[14:50:55] <shoky> hai, sou desu ne
[14:51:18] <shoky> ^__^
[14:51:33] <PhonicUK> stringify isn't working
[14:51:38] <PhonicUK> its not deep enough
[14:51:47] <PhonicUK> needs to work with associative arrays
[14:52:54] <shoky> JSON.stringify({a: { b: {c: {d: 7} }  } })
[14:52:58] <shoky> "{"a":{"b":{"c":{"d":7}}}}"
[14:55:04] <jingtao> hello. i'm looking for some advice on how to best distribute a module that relies on jquery. is it bad practice to just tack my namespace onto $?
[14:55:36] <PhonicUK> i have an object here that it just refuses to serialize properly
[14:55:46] <PhonicUK> i can run it in the debugger and see that the object has children
[14:55:52] <PhonicUK> but it just shows the array as being empty
[14:55:55] <tw2113> shoky weren't you just trying to help PhonicUK /
[14:55:58] <tw2113> ?
[14:56:12] <shoky> tw2113 yeah, why?
[14:56:21] <PhonicUK> its weird
[14:56:23] <tw2113> just making sure, he didn't see it apparently
[14:56:27] <PhonicUK> i did see it
[14:56:32] <PhonicUK> but his example didn't prove anything
[14:56:41] <shoky> well it proved something
[14:56:41] <tw2113> that's why you ask for clarification
[14:56:45] <shoky> maybe not EVERYthing ;)
[14:56:46] <tw2113> not ignore him
[14:56:47] <PhonicUK> for whatever reason stringify is ignoring some of my objects
[14:57:08] <tw2113> don't treat shoky like your stringifying is treating your json result
[14:57:18] <shoky> ;p
[14:57:47] <tw2113> shoky you should segfault right now just to be difficult
[14:57:58] * shoky dumps some cores
[14:58:04] <tw2113> just temporarily to confuse
[14:58:28] <PhonicUK> hmm this is odd
[14:59:51] <raj> shoky, got 1 more request. Can we allow an option that will set the starting height? I tried looking at http://jsfiddle.net/tPbKy/13/ but I'm not sure I understand what's going on with minHeight
[15:01:56] <shoky> just the starting height before any text is entered?
[15:02:24] <raj> yep
[15:02:35] <raj> so it's 1 line long until it has to be 2 lines long
[15:02:43] <raj> i mean, 1 line in height
[15:03:04] <raj> although, I'm wondering how different font-sizes would work with this script
[15:03:34] <shoky> they should work ok mostly, unless you set them dynamically
[15:03:44] <shoky> then you'd need to update that shadow div
[15:04:04] <raj> nono, it won't be dynamic
[15:06:32] <PhonicUK> gah this is annoying
[15:06:39] <PhonicUK> stringify just won't go deep enough
[15:06:45] <PhonicUK> it's ignoring things beyond a certain point and I can't see why
[15:07:30] <PhonicUK> hmm
[15:07:33] <PhonicUK> "JSON.stringify() wont output Object properties if your variable is an Array"
[15:08:04] <raj> PhonicUK, how about going through .each() in the array/object and stringifying each item?
[15:08:28] <PhonicUK> because then I have to work out what there position in the tree is
[15:08:36] <PhonicUK> the structure I want to serialize is effectively a document tree
[15:09:12] <raj> k
[15:09:24] <PhonicUK> aha!
[15:09:29] <PhonicUK> changing everything from arrays to objects worked
[15:11:32] <PhonicUK> if you declare an array and assign properties to it, it won't serialize them properly
[15:11:40] <shoky> yah.. arrays aren't associative arrays
[15:11:52] <shoky> objects are
[15:13:17] <PhonicUK> aye

[15:19:09] <species> cybuch: i get a picture of an audio thing of some sort
[15:19:12] * species not an audio guy
[15:19:27] <shoky> the value?
[15:19:32] <cybuch> ye
[15:19:35] <cybuch> the angle or smth
[15:19:37] <species> cybuch: what value? its a red box.
[15:19:56] <PhonicUK> hmm
[15:19:57] <species> cybuch: wait, you want to make a knob that you turn?
[15:20:09] <PhonicUK> is there an easy way of deep-cloning an object while ignoring certain fields?
[15:20:15] <shoky> um that's simple trigonometry if thats what you mean
[15:20:27] <cybuch> species: obviously yes, but that's all I was capable to do :P
[15:20:30] <species> PhonicUK: iterate it, use a blacklist that you check each item against
[15:20:35] <feathersanddown> Hi, is there a way to add a custom function where is executed after server data response and before success() function ?
[15:20:40] <PhonicUK> aye i figured as much
[15:20:49] <feathersanddown> in an ajax request
[15:22:10] <systemfault> feathersanddown: Add the code in the success handler?
[15:22:30] <systemfault> feathersanddown: Not sure I understand your problem.
[15:22:31] <cybuch> shoky: getting the variable slider would be enough?

[15:24:10] <tw2113> 856 bots in here sanderson
[15:24:21] <feathersanddown> systemfault: in an ajax request when success, jquery call success() function, I need to add a custom code in every success( ) function, I want to avoid that adding or using an "overriding" custom ajax request (for post and get)
[15:24:21] <tw2113> #jquery is very automated
[15:24:40] <sanderson> sweet.
[15:25:09] <sanderson> uestso wieo ansk a
[15:25:13] <sanderson> quesiton and the bots go to work?
[15:25:26] * tw2113 forgot the </sarcasm> tag
[15:25:34] <systemfault> feathersanddown: if you use promises, perhaps .pipe would do it.
[15:25:45] <feathersanddown> if I use what ?
[15:26:39] <ajpiano> feathersanddown: you can use the global ajasSuccess

[15:27:40] <PhonicUK> what's the best way to tell the difference between a defined object and a regular variable?
[15:27:47] <PhonicUK> hmm that doens't make much sense...
[15:28:05] <tw2113> how do you tell the difference between variable typs?

[15:28:23] <PhonicUK> not really
[15:28:24] <mathi> hi
[15:28:34] <PhonicUK> I'm trying to write a clone method
[15:28:53] <mathi> how can I call a widget's method from an element ?
[15:29:01] <PhonicUK> and so far I have this:
[15:29:02] <PhonicUK> http://pastebin.com/T7uRF03C
[15:29:17] <PhonicUK> problem is you can't run Object.keys on a non-object like a string or num
[15:29:43] <shoky> cybuch something like Math.atan2(dy,dx)
[15:29:53] <shoky> would get you the angle
[15:30:01] <sanderson> why are there so many bots?
[15:30:01] <cybuch> shoky: thanks
[15:30:36] <ajpiano> sanderson: he was being sarcastic
[15:30:36] <Lobosque> if I use .animate({width: 500, 1000); is the animation scalar? (0.5px each milisecond)
[15:31:16] <PhonicUK> ah this method works
[15:31:24] <feathersanddown> ajpiano: "Whenever an Ajax request completes successfully, jQuery triggers the ajaxSuccess event" but, when?? after or before or random time success function is called ?
[15:31:27] <PhonicUK> a try/catch on checking if it has any keys
[15:32:29] <feathersanddown> ajpiano: ahm.... but I need to process data from request too.... is possible ?
[15:33:05] <ajpiano> feathersanddown: you might be happier with a prefilter, to wrap the original success and call yours when you want
[15:33:55] <ajpiano> feathersanddown: it looks like it fires after the callbacks though
[15:34:17] <feathersanddown> but it block success function too ??
[15:35:03] <ajpiano> it doesn't block anything
[15:35:13] <ajpiano> the ajaxsuccess, or the prefilter
[15:35:30] <feathersanddown> i need to check data values before enter success function, indeed... I need to check values from data server and not to process success( ) if is an error comes in data
[15:35:47] <ajpiano> ah yes then a prefilter is perfect
[15:35:57] <feathersanddown> !prefilter
[15:35:58] <feathersanddown> ??

[15:40:17] <ajpiano> feathersanddown: you will obviously have to tweak it a bit but should get you going :)
[15:41:25] <shoky> cybuch: it's just an object, what do you mean by its value?  you could store it in a global variable if you want
[15:41:41] <shoky> right now its just local to that mousemove callback
[15:41:43] <cybuch> shoky: and how would i do that? :P

[16:34:21] <szikael> i made it
[16:38:15] <PhonicUK> here's a tricky one
[16:38:31] <PhonicUK> I've loaded in a lump of javascript and used eval() on it to execute it
[16:38:37] <PhonicUK> that lump of javascript contained a bunch of functions
[16:38:58] <PhonicUK> I have the name of the function I want to call in a string, but I can't figure out how to call it
[16:39:08] <PhonicUK> the usual window['functionname'] doesn't work here
[16:56:27] <Whirl3d> PhonicUK, I have asked that a dozen times and never got an answer. Hopefuly you'll figure it out and report back.
[16:56:47] <PhonicUK> Whirl3d, I just went about it a different way
[16:56:57] <Whirl3d> mr too
[16:56:58] <PhonicUK> took the script source and actually put it in a <script> tag
[16:57:09] <PhonicUK> so i could indeed use window['functionname']
[16:57:31] <Whirl3d> but how did you apply it to something then?
[16:58:13] <PhonicUK> var fn = window['functionname']; fn(args);
[16:58:55] <Whirl3d> so then you could sloce it as well with apply. Pretty smart. I should try that
[16:59:05] <Whirl3d> scope
[16:59:12] <Whirl3d> sloce? LOL
[17:14:36] <PhonicUK> woot woot
[17:14:38] <PhonicUK> alpine works :D
[17:15:00] <shoky> only on youtube!
[17:15:05] <PhonicUK> lol
[17:15:11] <PhonicUK> you'll be able to play with it yourself soon
[17:17:54] <shoky> PhonicUK maybe you wanna take a look at $.globalEval
[17:18:15] <PhonicUK> ooooh
[17:18:38] <PhonicUK> its probably best to keep to using script tags
[17:18:39] <PhonicUK> easier to debug
[17:19:31] <baconmania> Hey guys, I'm wondering how I'd implement this scenario. I have a form which includes a dropdown menu whose options are pulled from a database. If the user wants an option that isn't in the database/dropdown menu, they can choose "add new option" in the dropdown. When the user chooses to add a new option, is there a way I can open a new window, allow the user to add his option to the database, then once that page is submitted, go b
[17:19:34] <baconmania> and update that dropdown with the newly added option?
[17:21:15] <shoky> that's a lot of questions
[17:21:21] <baconmania> I think it just boils down to "can I send data between windows"
[17:21:24] <devinceartas> baconmania: look up combo box?
[17:22:17] <shoky> baconmania in a modern site you wouldn't want to open a new window
[17:23:02] <shoky> and that'd save you the trouble of communicating with it
[17:23:07] <baconmania> shoky:
[17:23:13] <baconmania> so a modal dialog?
[17:23:17] <shoky> yep
[17:23:33] <shoky> or nonmodal
[17:23:34] <baconmania> what if the user wanted to interact with the original page
[17:23:41] <shoky> doesnt have to be modal
[17:23:47] <baconmania> true...
[17:24:14] <baconmania> would that degrade gracefully?
[17:24:47] <shoky> with no js?
[17:25:20] <baconmania> yar.
[17:25:44] <shoky> how would you open a new window
[17:25:59] <baconmania> ....good point
[17:26:14] <baconmania> I could degrade the button to an <a target="_blank">
[17:26:31] <shoky> the button that used to be a selectbox?
[17:26:47] <baconmania> oh right
[17:26:49] <baconmania> ...this is awkward
[17:26:54] <shoky> i wouldnt call that graceful ;P
[17:26:57] <baconmania> lolol
[17:27:14] <baconmania> yeah that's more of an "in principle" question anyway, since the app I'm writing would be largely useless without JS
[17:27:34] <shoky> then you're set ;)
[17:27:39] <baconmania> thanks
[17:27:50] <baconmania> also, do you guys know any good jquery packages that support a modal dialog stack?
[17:27:53] <baconmania> so like
[17:27:54] <baconmania> open a modal
[17:27:56] <baconmania> and then from that
[17:28:09] <baconmania> open another modal which takes focus, and then when modal2 is done modal1 regains exclusive focus
[17:28:34] <baconmania> with or without jquery
[17:30:29] <baconmania> ...or is that default behavior of jquery's modal dialogs <_<
[17:31:04] <shoky> have you tried?
[17:31:20] <shoky> and its jquery ui
[17:31:44] <baconmania> Thanks.
[17:32:12] <devinceartas> baconmania: if you can define an on close handler, which I think you can with jqueryui dialog, you could have it do whatever you want
[17:32:29] <shoky> they have a 'moveToTop' option/method
[17:32:43] <baconmania> ahh, good call shoky
[17:33:34] <chicocvenancio> I'm having trouble manually showing a tooltip with tipsy
[17:33:50] <baconmania> devinceartas: if I decided to open a second window and bind to onclose() instead of using a js dialog in the same window, how would I actually send data from window2 to window1?
[17:33:55] <chicocvenancio> $("#"+id).attr("title", 'string').tipsy("show"); Works in the console but not when called
[17:34:56] <devinceartas> baconmania: I guess either in the on close or via a global variable
[17:35:11] <baconmania> apparently you can do window.opener.$() from window2
[17:35:15] <baconmania> which is freakin' awesome
[17:35:45] <devinceartas> True, that gets you some info
[17:36:04] <chicocvenancio> anyone familiar with tipsy?
[17:36:10] <baconmania> well it should let you arbitrarily manipulate window1's dom from window2, no?

[17:56:16] <mparodi> Hello guys
[17:56:23] <mparodi> I believe there's a bug in the slider
[17:56:33] <mparodi> http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#option-animate
[17:56:43] <mparodi> the animation is not working when you have only one parameter
[17:56:53] <mparodi> s/parameter/handler/
[17:56:58] <mparodi> it works well when you have two handlers
[17:57:03] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: If you click the third button it'll animate to the second then animate to the third
[17:57:06] <Eviltwin> Is that the intended behavior?
[17:57:15] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: well right now i'm gonna make it so it'll go to the next one
[17:57:21] <someprimetime> that's on the to-do list
[17:57:34] <someprimetime> then i'm gonna pause it once you hover on the actual images also on the to-do list
[17:57:45] <someprimetime> i'm using setTimeout rather than setInterval, you think that's ok?
[17:58:20] <Eviltwin> It's usually better to use setTimeout anyway
[17:58:37] <someprimetime> cool
[17:58:46] <mparodi>     $( ".selector" ).slider({ animate: true }); <-- that doesn't work
[17:59:09] <someprimetime> you need to give it a direction @mparodi
[17:59:36] <Lyfesaver> can anyone tell me what is breaking the jQuery dialog from working in this very small bit of code
[17:59:36] <someprimetime> $('.selector').slider({'left' : -300'}, 'slow'); maybe?
[17:59:38] <Lyfesaver> http://jsfiddle.net/cpXNC/
[17:59:54] <someprimetime> Lyfesaver: you put your js in the html panel
[17:59:55] <shoky> mparodi: what do you mean, when you have only one handler?
[18:00:03] <someprimetime> why?
[18:00:17] <someprimetime> you also look like you're using jquery without selecting it as your library on the left
[18:00:22] <mparodi> someprimetime, direction?
[18:00:31] <someprimetime> mparodi: what are you trying to animate?
[18:00:36] <mparodi> shoky, handler -> square that mark the position in the slider
[18:00:36] <someprimetime> got a fiddle perhaps?
[18:01:02] <mparodi> no, the idea is that when it's on value 10, for instance, and you click at the end of the slider
[18:01:13] <mparodi> it goes there but...
[18:01:17] <mparodi> smoothly
[18:01:19] <mparodi> not instantly
[18:01:28] <Lyfesaver> http://jsfiddle.net/cpXNC/1/
[18:01:38] <Lyfesaver> sry i fogot to finsh those b4 i posted
[18:01:49] <mparodi> <someprimetime> $('.selector').slider({'left' : -300'}, 'slow'); maybe?
[18:01:59] <mparodi> the left option is not documented, what do you mean?
[18:02:02] <someprimetime> oh wait mparodi is this in response to what i posted?
[18:02:09] <mparodi> no
[18:02:11] <someprimetime> of my slideshow?
[18:02:11] <mparodi> I'm asking
[18:02:11] <someprimetime> oh
[18:02:16] <mparodi> :P
[18:02:41] <someprimetime> $('.slider').animate({'left': -300}, 'slow');
[18:03:01] <someprimetime> that'll move the div with classname slider left -300px
[18:03:05] <someprimetime> but put a position: relative on it
[18:03:33] <mparodi> your're talking about a different thing
[18:03:49] <mparodi> $('<div>').appendTo('body').slider({animate: true});
[18:03:52] <mparodi> try that
[18:04:05] <someprimetime> i'm confused
[18:04:26] <someprimetime> are you giving me advice for my code or are you asking for advice for yours? i feel like we're both working on sliders or something lol
[18:04:44] <mparodi> no! I don't know what your problem is. I'm asking about a problem I have :P
[18:04:55] <someprimetime> bahaha ok then
[18:05:16] <mparodi> somewhor the animation works with $('<div>').appendTo('body').slider({animate: true});
[18:05:27] <mparodi> but not in the real code Â¬Â¬
[18:05:34] <someprimetime> can you post a fiddle?
[18:06:47] <shoky> here's a fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/FtQh9/
[18:07:12] <mparodi> oh, I found the error!
[18:07:40] <mparodi> the problem was on the slide callback :)
[18:07:48] <mparodi> ie, it was my fault
[18:08:08] <shoky> next time jsfiddle it
[18:08:13] <Lyfesaver> http://jsfiddle.net/cpXNC/2/
[18:08:17] <Lyfesaver> still no joy =(
[18:08:42] <shoky> Lyfesaver: you're missing a comma
[18:08:53] <shoky> before   hide: "explode"
[18:09:27] <Lyfesaver> ahhhhh
[18:09:34] <Lyfesaver> lol tyvm shoky
[18:09:36] <shoky> look at your console, man :\
[18:10:29] <someprimetime> that explode effect is horri
[18:10:30] <someprimetime> +d
[18:12:44] <Lyfesaver> odd, shoky adding that comma.. made my button disappear
[18:12:50] <Lyfesaver> it did need it
[18:12:58] <Lyfesaver> but now it looks like i have another problem =)
[18:13:07] <someprimetime> Lyfesaver: you set autoOpen: false
[18:13:12] <someprimetime> obviously it's hiding it with that option
[18:13:24] <Lyfesaver> ahh
[18:13:29] <Lyfesaver> ya my button is inside the div
[18:13:33] <Lyfesaver> u r sure right
[18:13:36] <Lyfesaver> tyvm
[18:14:04] <shoky> your html is fuxed
[18:14:07] <shoky> think you meant this: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/cpXNC/4/
[18:14:24] <Lyfesaver> yup
[18:14:33] <Lyfesaver> tyvm =)
[18:14:46] <Lyfesaver> i did not snip out all of the code i needed
[18:14:49] <Lyfesaver> thx guys =)
[18:27:42] <RPkS> shoky: I'm still trying to fix my jquery - fancybox problem. I made a couple of changes that were for the better code-wise, but I'm thinking the problem has is some coding error(s) on my part. http://puu.sh/tmkQ
[18:27:51] <thenickbe> Hi all! Trying to lazy load images w/ jquery lazy load that are being dynamically pulled from a cms. They need to be displayed using jcarousel. Both are working, except lazyloads default event is scroll and I can't seem to get the click event working properly. Tried many things, currently on this http://pastebin.com/ZG9pujAF
[18:28:03] <thenickbe> Oops... hope pastebin is ok, just say the jsfiddle note
[18:28:10] <thenickbe> Any thoughts?
[18:29:21] <shoky> RPkS: how would i know
[18:29:23] <RPkS> thenickbe: We have some stuff in common with this problem
[18:29:45] <RPkS> I was hoping you might see something I'm missing.
[18:30:01] <thenickbe> I can take a look if you'd like
[18:30:15] <shoky> but i have no idea what your issue is , and havent seen the code in question
[18:30:48] <RPkS> https://hiddencameragear.com/cellphone-recon-usb-surveillance-tool   thanks
[18:31:18] <thenickbe> so what's the issue?
[18:31:18] <shoky> and the issue?
[18:31:46] <RPkS> Trying to use jquery to create the little image gallery to the left of the large product image.
[18:31:56] <shoky> works fine
[18:31:59] <RPkS> Those thumbnails are fancybox
[18:32:04] <shoky> sorta.
[18:32:15] <shoky> ok it doesn't.
[18:32:18] <RPkS> Yes it works great until I minify the code and then it breaks
[18:32:49] <shoky> then get a better minifier/learn how to use yours better/dont minify
[18:33:08] <thenickbe> hmm... im not seeing it break
[18:33:11] <RPkS> I'll turn on the minify extension and it will mess up
[18:33:18] <RPkS> just a moment
[18:33:19] <shoky> it breaks when you start scrolling up after scrolling down some
[18:33:21] <thenickbe> kk
[18:33:27] <shoky> but that's not the issue he's talking about
[18:33:39] <RPkS> ok now refresh
[18:33:58] <shoky> i answered
[18:34:09] <thenickbe> ahh, yeah i see
[18:34:16] <thenickbe> so... what's the issue w/ not minifying?
[18:34:18] <thenickbe> if it works
[18:34:23] <RPkS> LOL ...yeah it's kind of hard not to notice
[18:34:25] <thenickbe> a few k?
[18:34:40] <RPkS> a WHOLE bunch of kb's
[18:34:48] <thenickbe> haha, how many?
[18:34:48] <Parhs> hello guys.. I downloaded a jquery calendar because it matched my requirements. I customized the css and extended js to add some needed parameters and functions. However i need a way to add at specified days a css class or modify something.. adding a "hook" function (it will be called when each day is rendered at calendar) that user can write is good solution ?
[18:34:59] <RPkS> I go from 8.2 seconds loading to 2.4
[18:35:04] <thenickbe> ahh
[18:35:56] <thenickbe> are we talking jquery.min? or another script?
[18:36:08] <RPkS> It's saying $("#carousel94 ul").jcarousel is not a function
[18:36:15] <Whirl3d> what is a good way to determine if a property is animatable?
[18:36:36] <shoky> checking jquery source ;p
[18:36:42] <shoky> or, trying it
[18:36:56] <RPkS> Well I admit that I;m not as advanced as I wish
[18:37:16] <m0dmd> RPkS: why use something advanced if you're not advanced :)
[18:37:25] <RPkS> <script type="text/javascript"> $('#carousel94 ul').jcarousel({
[18:37:26] <Whirl3d> jquery source allows all scalar variable to be animated, I believe. I guess you would have to try it and see what happens, but that seems awfully costly
[18:37:38] <RPkS> Well I had it working fine and then... LOL
[18:37:58] <thenickbe> m0dmd: because it's a great way to learn
[18:38:01] <thenickbe> and become more advanced
[18:38:21] <m0dmd> yea let me get in a race car and start at nascar instead of learning how to race in a go kart
[18:38:38] <thenickbe> oh, my bad... didn't realize playing around w/ jquery was the same thing
[18:38:54] <m0dmd> no it was just a response to his comment about advanced
[18:38:56] <m0dmd> :)
[18:39:16] <RPkS> Yes sometimes you have to go through growing pains, but dang I'm too o.... well anyway. I'd love to figure out whats making it break
[18:39:30] <m0dmd> RPkS: got the example?
[18:41:01] <thenickbe> uggh... sitting in a chat room where people ask for help, and then making sarcastic comments about their skill level is BS
[18:41:45] <shoky> RPkS: jquery carousel js isn't being loaded
[18:41:47] <RPkS> Well I can explain exactly why I put the scroller on the left side ...because people are lazy as ####. You better put as much pertinent info DIRECTLY  in front of their eyes or they will be gone in an instant. That's the REAL reason. LOL
[18:42:53] <RPkS> ok shoky ...what have I done wrong or is something out of whack with the extension I purchased?
[18:44:30] <shoky> RPkS: either something is out of whack with it, or you don't know how to use it properly
[18:45:46] <RPkS> Well it could be both. LOL ....At least I know what's not loading, so that should make it easier to address. Thank you VERY much
[18:46:13] <RPkS> There wasn;t much to the install, but I may have made a slight error.
[18:48:10] <Whirl3d> RPkS, do you know how to use Chrome's developer console or firebug to see what's loading and what isn't?
[18:48:13] <NCS_One> is there some way of getting the next "div", this with other elements between
[18:48:29] <NCS_One> ?
[18:48:34] <Whirl3d> use a selector with next
[18:48:40] <johnkpaul> ?next @NCS_One
[18:48:40] <bot-t> NCS_One, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[18:48:43] <RPkS> Yes I use firebug all day
[18:49:10] <Whirl3d> RPk5, then you can see if your script is loading...that'd be the first step, huh?
[18:49:25] <NCS_One> johnkpaul: but doesn't that "it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector"?
[18:49:40] <thenickbe> anyone w/ lazyload experience?
[18:49:48] <ajpiano> ?nextAll @ NCS_One
[18:49:48] <bot-t> NCS_One, .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[18:49:58] <ajpiano> RPkS: the problem is *only* when the code is minified?
[18:50:14] <RPkS> yes it only happoens when the code is minified
[18:50:23] <ajpiano> which minifier are you using?
[18:51:45] <RPkS> http://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=account/download/info&order_id=154494
[18:52:06] <ajpiano> that doesn't answer the question at all
[18:52:22] <RPkS> I don;t think that will open for you unless you have an account ....dang let see if I can get it with a link that will open'
[18:52:23] <ajpiano> what is the name of the package that you are using to minify the javascript
[18:53:02] <RPkS> This is a link to the demo from the developer
[18:53:03] <shoky> i think the problem is there's another javascript error before the minifier loads jcarousel
[18:53:03] <RPkS> http://www.hunterbm.com/oc/1521/
[18:53:09] <shoky> Uncaught ReferenceError: OPENCART_VERSION is not defined
[18:53:21] <ajpiano> yeah shoky is right
[18:53:28] <ajpiano> RPkS: the developer of what?
[18:54:27] <RPkS> opencart
[18:54:40] <ajpiano> opencart has its own built in javascript minifier?
[18:55:31] <RPkS> No it's a custom build
[18:55:34] <shoky> RPkS:  is this your code?  if (OPENCART_VERSION < 1.5) {
[18:55:45] <RPkS> no that isn;t my code ....it
[18:55:58] <RPkS> it's just a demo site
[18:56:05] <shoky> uh
[18:56:14] <ajpiano> that is inside of the code that's running on your site
[18:56:25] <shoky> well that's the bad code that you need to get fixed
[18:56:31] <ajpiano> omg
[18:56:47] <ajpiano> RPkS: you are including the minifed JS file *before* you declare all those globals
[18:56:49] <RPkS> well I sent you a download link by pm ...I couldn;t post it in a public channel
[18:57:14] <RPkS> ajpiano ...anything is possible. BLUSH
[18:57:28] <ajpiano> line 145 of your rendered html var OPENCART_VERSION = 1.5;
[18:57:34] <RPkS> Yes I am ...
[18:57:59] <ajpiano> so you should probably not do that
[18:58:01] <RPkS> you are looking at MY page source right?
[18:58:05] <ajpiano> yes
[18:58:40] <RPkS> Well, what is the proper way for me to address the4 issue ....besides 3 weeks of hard core studying.
[18:59:13] <ajpiano> moving the script include from line 72 in the output to be somewhere *after* those globals are declared
[18:59:23] <ajpiano> or moving those globals to higher up before where that minifed js is included
[19:05:25] <NCS_One> isn't there the opposite of .closest()?
[19:05:58] <johnkpaul> ?find @NCS_One
[19:05:59] <bot-t> NCS_One, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[19:06:18] <johnkpaul> well, that's not _exactly_ the opposite
[19:06:21] <johnkpaul> because it doesn't include the current one
[19:06:27] <johnkpaul> what are you trying to do, NCS_One?
[19:08:38] <NCS_One> eg have "<div><a...</div><div>..." how to get the last div from the a?
[19:10:08] <johnkpaul> NCS_One: last meaning outermost?
[19:10:45] <NCS_One> right
[19:10:47] <johnkpaul> NCS_One: $("a").parents("div").last()
[19:11:45] <NCS_One> johnkpaul: the last div isn't parent of the a
[19:12:25] <johnkpaul> oh, I see
[19:12:34] <johnkpaul> NCS_One: is it always nested exactly like that?
[19:12:42] <NCS_One> yes
[19:12:47] <johnkpaul> $("a").parent().next()
[19:13:07] <NCS_One> johnkpaul: thanks
[19:13:08] <johnkpaul> you should look through http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/, NCS_One
[19:13:19] <johnkpaul> there are a lot more dom traversing functions than we just used
[19:13:23] <NCS_One> ok, thanks again
[19:13:28] <johnkpaul> no problem, have fun
[19:17:16] <Whirl3d> NCS_One, do you know the "grouped" elements beforehand?
[19:17:58] <NCS_One> yes
[19:18:15] <Whirl3d> I have been working on a "peers" extension that would allow you to register your "peers" and accest them using nextpeer
[19:18:19] <Whirl3d> or prevpeer
[19:18:22] <Whirl3d> or firstpeer
[19:18:25] <Whirl3d> or lastpeer
[19:18:56] <Whirl3d> It's a tiny piece of code, but it sounds like what you might want.
[19:19:04] <NCS_One> link? :)
[19:19:49] <Whirl3d> i;ll work out a fiddle. brb
[19:20:48] <NCS_One> ok
[19:20:52] <NCS_One> thanks
[19:24:31] <scraniel> what's the best way to package a module that relies on jquery? as a "plugin" attached to the $ namespace, or should i just use jquery inside of my own namespace?
[19:24:53] <mparodi> can't you use the CSS :after metaelement?
[19:25:04] <mparodi> $('<div>').find(':after').length == 0
[19:25:36] <mparodi> (it's NOT the same as $('<div>').after(...)
[19:25:37] <mparodi> )
[19:28:46] <thenickbe> so im trying out jquery JAIL to lazy load images, running into a problem integrating it w/ jcarousel. I have 3 images showing, need the first images to auto load, and the rest to load on prev/next button clicks - can only get the scroll event to work. This is what I've got so far. http://pastebin.com/EredahWb
[19:29:47] <thenickbe> This is their GIT page https://github.com/sebarmeli/JAIL
[19:30:25] <thenickbe> I'm also open to using the lazyload script, but I've failed w/ that so far as well, so I'm trying JAIL
[19:30:32] <thenickbe> seems to be very similar though
[19:30:39] <AllStruck> Im trying to create a custom effect in jquery cycle like this http://jsfiddle.net/QGRv9/1/ do I need to include more than just jquery and cycle for this?
[19:32:30] <Whirl3d> NCS_one, sorry gimme one more minute I have to take a call.
[19:33:38] <thenickbe> Any thoughts on the lazyloading?
[19:36:08] <NCS_One> Whirl3d: no problem
[19:37:02] <scraniel> if i grab element.data() inside of a plugin method, do i need to explicitly set element.data() to have any changes made to the returned object stick?
[19:37:44] * neersighted DERPO
[19:40:58] <shoky> scraniel, if it's an object and you have a reference to it, you don't need to explicitly set it again
[19:41:07] <shoky> the object is the object
[19:41:43] <shoky> which is.. just an object
[19:41:43] <scraniel> shoky: that makes sense, but when would it not be an object?
[19:41:58] <shoky> when it's a string or a number, for example
[19:42:23] <scraniel> ooh okay
[19:42:37] <scraniel> i thought there was something more magical going on under the hood
[19:42:43] <tomoyuki28jp> When we start a new project now, which template engine do you guys recommend to use? jsrender?
[19:43:03] <scraniel> thanks :)
[19:43:03] <shoky> i think opinions differ
[19:43:50] <shoky> tomoyuki28jp checkout: http://garann.github.com/template-chooser/
[19:44:05] <tomoyuki28jp> shoky: thanks!
[19:45:42] <shoky> AllStruck: it's working no?
[20:32:30] <AllStruck> shoky: The jsfiddle works yes but I can't seem to duplicate it, I can get cycle going but not when I define a new transition
[20:35:37] <iamntz> hey guys, i kinda did a jquery plugin for triggering css keyframes js events http://www.iamntz.com/3157/ what do you think? :)
[20:35:51] <storybump> hey guys ... I have this: $(".theButton").live("click", function(){ .......... and I want something like: $(".theButton").live("click",    OR $(".theOtherButton").live("click",   function{ do stuff } ... any ideas?
[20:36:51] <c0kemachine> http://pastebin.com/4T8xjbr9 - I would like some help with this please
[20:39:10] <cgiGeek> sorry kinda of quick question for $('foo').observe('click', respondToClick); what would be the syntax to respont to enter as well
[20:45:41] <garann> cgiGeek: you need to listen for a keydown or keypress event, then check whether e.keyCode == 13
[20:45:58] <cgiGeek> thanks
[20:49:51] <thenickbe> anyone off hand know if you can use Nivo to display multiple images instead of just one?
[21:20:24] <thenickbe> anyone around?
[21:20:50] <vladikoff> thenickbe, what's up?
[21:21:13] <shoky> werd
[21:23:02] <thenickbe> sorry if this is a repeat... trying to use either lazyload or jail to delay image loading along w/ jcarousel for the obvious effect. However, both of the image loading scripts default event is scrolling, and I need it based off of the carousel's next/prev click, and not in order of the li's down the page, but whatevers in view
[21:25:54] <thenickbe> if you guys think you can help i can show whatever code is necessary
[21:27:14] <prefixed> how would I add this to my site? http://remysharp.com/2008/09/10/the-silky-smooth-marquee/comment-page-4/#allcomments
[21:27:50] <prefixed> I am not clear on how to include "the latest jquery"
[21:28:34] <thenickbe> you can either use Google's jquery or upload it to your server in link to it
[21:28:57] <prefixed> ok
[21:29:08] <thenickbe> do you know how to do either?
[21:29:10] <prefixed> and how would I go about including that script?
[21:29:13] <thenickbe> kk
[21:29:23] <prefixed> I can include via google
[21:29:32] <thenickbe> https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide
[21:29:36] <prefixed> I believe I've done it before, just forgot about it
[21:29:36] <thenickbe> check that out
[21:29:41] <thenickbe> find what you want
[21:29:44] <thenickbe> and place it in your head
[21:30:01] <thenickbe> it'll say jQuery and give you a path
[21:30:24] <thenickbe> use the path as if it were a js file on your server
[21:31:03] <thenickbe> do you know that syntax?
[21:31:14] <prefixed> not really
[21:32:14] <prefixed> oh
[21:32:17] <prefixed> ok one second
[21:32:20] <thenickbe> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
[21:32:25] <thenickbe> there you go
[21:32:34] <thenickbe> put that in the head of your html file
[21:34:31] <prefixed> don't i need something like this to load jquery? <script type="text/javascript">google.load('jquery', '1.4.4')</script>
[21:34:38] <thenickbe> you guys have any thoughts on the lazyloading problem??
[21:34:48] <thenickbe> i believe there are multiple ways to do it
[21:35:00] <thenickbe> i've never used that syntax before
[21:35:26] <thenickbe> so I'm not sure the pros/cons of the differences
[21:35:33] <thenickbe> plus, I usually load it locally anyways
[21:35:42] <prefixed> hm
[21:36:50] <thenickbe> what i gave you before will work though
[21:36:58] <thenickbe> that's how I do it if I'm using google
[21:37:36] <prefixed> also, how do I include this particular script? http://remysharp.com/2008/09/10/the-silky-smooth-marquee/comment-page-4/#allcomments
[21:38:09] <thenickbe> download the plugin, upload it to your server
[21:38:26] <thenickbe> then link to it in the head w/ the syntax i gave you before, just replace the src to the local file
[21:40:26] <prefixed> so this is all I'd need? <script src="http://inyourspeakers.com/js/jquery.marquee.js"></script>
[21:40:51] <thenickbe> you can leave out the domain name
[21:40:59] <thenickbe> start w/ /js
[21:41:06] <thenickbe> as long as thats the correct path
[21:41:20] <coldhead> web stuffs is hard
[21:41:29] <prefixed> eh
[21:41:35] <prefixed> it's only hard with drupal
[21:41:43] <thenickbe> drupal is fun :)
[21:41:48] <coldhead> its hard other places too
[21:41:51] <coldhead> that's what he said
[21:42:19] <thenickbe> prefixed... you using D7?
[21:42:24] <prefixed> 6
[21:42:27] <thenickbe> ahh, kk then
[21:42:30] <thenickbe> that's fine
[21:42:42] <prefixed> why what's up with d7?
[21:43:07] <thenickbe> well, 6 uses it too, but 7's standard for adding css and js is different as you're supposed to load it through the .info file
[21:43:25] <thenickbe> but in 6 I always just added it in the head of the page.tpl.php file
[21:43:33] <thenickbe> or whatever template file i was using
[21:43:43] <prefixed> yeah
[21:43:46] <prefixed> that's what I'm doing
[21:43:53] <thenickbe> kk
[21:44:00] <prefixed> drupal is throwing some braindead error message though
[21:44:07] <thenickbe> oh shit though
[21:44:17] <thenickbe> drupal auto loads jquery
[21:44:19] <prefixed> and the script appears to be ignoring my width parameters
[21:44:22] <thenickbe> yeah
[21:44:31] <thenickbe> you should use the jquery update module for d6
[21:44:38] <thenickbe> though that only ups it to 1.3.2
[21:44:50] <thenickbe> as anything above it breaks certain things in the admin area
[21:44:51] <prefixed> why so old?
[21:44:55] <prefixed> oh
[21:45:00] <thenickbe> there are work arounds though
[21:45:12] <thenickbe> but if you can get away w/ it i'd just use that
[21:46:28] <thenickbe> anyone experienced w/ the lazyload script???
[21:47:05] <prefixed> that's a script?
[21:47:21] <prefixed> I thought it was a concept
[21:47:32] <thenickbe> http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload
[21:47:39] <thenickbe> there's also JAIL
[21:51:29] <jonathancutrell> Hey folks. Got an interesting error, wondering if any of you have seen this before
[21:51:54] <jonathancutrell> SCRIPT3: Member not found
[21:52:04] <jonathancutrell> jquery.min.js, line 3, character 3769
[21:52:12] <jonathancutrell> This is 1.7.2 btw
[21:52:35] <jonathancutrell> Anyone familiar with this error?
[21:52:59] <systemfault> Nope, but it's definitely your code ;)
[21:53:19] <jonathancutrell> systemfault: I'm aware of that. However, it's only happening in ie8
[21:53:46] <systemfault> Do you have a link we could look at?
[21:54:41] <jonathancutrell> systemfault: mind if I pm it to you?
[21:54:57] <systemfault> No, it's okay
[21:54:58] <jonathancutrell> We can keep the discussion open certainly.
[21:55:07] <jonathancutrell> alrighty. thanks.
[21:59:03] <shoky> Mmm
[21:59:41] <shoky> secrecy
[21:59:52] <NCS_One> i have "$('body').on('click','#yt0',function(){jQuery.ajax({..." on ajax() how do I get the clicked element?
[22:00:43] <shoky> $('body').on('click','#yt0',function(){ var el = this;  ........................... } )
[22:03:47] <thenickb> still trying to work on the lazyloading with the carousel, this is what I have currently http://pastebin.com/rhvWysQM ... which is obviously not working
[22:03:54] <thenickb> can someone take a look?
[22:04:09] <thenickb> let me know if you need to see more
[22:04:34] <jonathancutrell> NCS_One: You can also grab it from the event. $("body").on("click", function(e){ var el = e.target; });
[22:04:47] <jonathancutrell> NCS_One: But this method will return the element that the event was fired from.
[22:05:01] <tomoyuki28jp> Question regarding jsrender. Is there a way to define a local variable inside a template?
[22:05:51] <jonathancutrell> thenickb: two things I notice right away
[22:06:02] <jonathancutrell> you are triggering click on ALL div elements on the page
[22:06:40] <jonathancutrell> your options in lazy load have a trailing comma; they should end with no comma on the last property.
[22:07:35] <thenickb> jonathancutrell: kk, thanks - changed that. problem still remains
[22:08:42] <thenickb> if you haven't seen yet (i've been asking for a little while) I'm trying to lazyload images inside a carousel. The default for the load is scrolling, but i need it based on the clicks of the next/prev buttons from the carousel
[22:09:24] <Goopyo> is there a way to put a global decorator for all route views?
[22:09:44] <Goopyo> like if I wanted to make something like @logged_in for all views
[22:10:29] <jonathancutrell> thenickb: I'm not really very familiar with lazyload, so I can't really help you there. Your syntax is fine, but your functions may not be doing the right things.
[22:10:47] <jonathancutrell> what does triggering a click on all divs do, for instance?
[22:11:52] <thenickb> didn't mean to do it for all divs
[22:11:58] <thenickb> changed it to a div w/ a class
[22:12:22] <thenickb> bc the prev/next click areas are divs, and you use a background image for the button image
[22:12:33] <thenickb> so i need it on click of the div, since there is no img in the div
[22:23:15] <Ahmed> Anyone could give me an idea what to search for if I wanted something to change the text inside a <span> continuesly upon page load?
[22:23:32] <Ahmed> continuously*
[22:24:22] <jonathancutrell> Ahmed: depends on where you're getting your data from
[22:24:32] <jonathancutrell> Ahmed: if you just want to fake it,
[22:24:39] <Ahmed> it's just a 1 word thing
[22:24:49] <Ahmed> changing between the two words "before" and "after"
[22:25:08] <jonathancutrell> Ahmed: $("span#someID").text("before")
[22:25:37] <jonathancutrell> Ahmed: That changes the text of a span with an id of someID to "before"
[22:26:16] <jonathancutrell> Ahmed: if you wanted to do that over time, you would use setTimeout, setInterval, or a fancy jQuery delay function or something.
[22:26:49] <Ahmed> Got it
[22:28:49] <Ahmed> Thanks man
[22:29:05] <Ahmed> Now I have to figure out why I get $(document).ready(function() {
[22:29:13] <coldhead> what a triumph of the human spirit
[22:42:58] <shoky> que
[22:44:56] <coldhead> hey you, the one that smells like christmas
[22:50:43] <ijse> How to use JQueryUI widget's namespace?
[22:51:32] <ijse> Anyone who knows ?
[22:57:41] <coldhead> ijse: ajpiano knows and i bet he's written about it online
[22:57:48] <coldhead> search for ajpiano ui namespace
[23:01:21] <Whirl3d> hey all. I have been half-heatedly working on a grouping method extension for jquery that would provide access to methods like .nextPeer() or currentPeer() that would allow non-sibling elements to be grouped logically together and traversed using these methods. I had it almost working and then tried to abstract it a little more and now it's just not working.
[23:01:35] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/JujgT/
[23:01:56] <prefixed> can someone explain how this script should be implemented inline? http://remysharp.com/2008/09/10/the-silky-smooth-marquee/comment-page-1/#allcomments
[23:01:59] <Whirl3d> It's just a pet project to learn jquery extension writing, so it's not important.
[23:02:47] <prefixed> like can I simply use the <marquee> tag with it?
[23:03:03] <Wilornel> Guys, you should try during the day
[23:03:20] <Wilornel> I mean, to ask questions when everybody is here
[23:03:30] <coldhead> you should try during the US day *IF* you don't get results sooner
[23:03:39] <coldhead> we can't expect those poor bastards to do ALL the support
[23:03:50] <Whirl3d> prefixed. If you include the marquee script in your header, you should be able to use the markup you mentioned
[23:04:52] <prefixed> hm
[23:05:05] <coldhead> looks like you also need to apply the method like $('marquee').marquee(optionalClass);
[23:05:20] <prefixed> how?
[23:06:37] <prefixed> coldhead I'm not clear on what that means
[23:07:41] <Whirl3d> in the instructions, which I just glanced at, mind you, it would appear that the items you want to marquee you could add a class declaration to <marquee class='marguee'>stuf</marquee>  then in your head element $(document).ready($('marquee').marquee(".marquee");});
[23:08:45] <coldhead> prefixed: so you need 3 things, you need a <marquee> element in your html, you need to load the marquee script that remy has writtern AND you need to say in jQuery "apply the marquee plugin we've loaded to THIS particular element"
[23:09:15] <coldhead> its like when a man and a woman love each other very much
[23:09:18] <coldhead> wait, that's a bad example
[23:09:29] <coldhead> consider a perfectly spherical butterfly
[23:09:30] <prefixed> coldhead what would "THIS particular element" be?
[23:09:35] <coldhead> hmm
[23:09:43] <coldhead> oh that's the bit in the $('HERE I AM')
[23:09:57] <coldhead> it's $('marquee') if you want to apply it to the marquee tag
[23:10:12] <prefixed> yes
[23:10:14] <coldhead> but you could apply it somewhere else, $('p.someClass') or $('#someId')
[23:10:43] <coldhead> my point is remy's script doesn't automatically apply itself to any <marquee>s you have
[23:10:47] <coldhead> you gotta tell it
[23:10:53] <prefixed> ok, so I have this in my head
[23:10:53] <prefixed> <script src="/js/jquery.marquee.js"></script>
[23:11:06] <coldhead> and you have that after you included jquery.js, right?
[23:11:14] <prefixed> yes
[23:11:21] <coldhead> Whirl3d: your plugin is pretty cool but i don't understand how it's broken
[23:11:45] <prefixed> now, how can I tell the script to apply to all <marquee> tags?
[23:12:08] <prefixed> do I do that in the <head> element or?
[23:12:08] <Whirl3d> lol. I had a typo...this.memembers....lol
[23:12:14] <mbrevda> im trying to insert new rows to a table, for some reason it only works once. Why?? http://jsfiddle.net/r4cb2/1/
[23:12:45] <coldhead> prefixed: you can do it wherever you like
[23:12:50] <dr0id> why are you guys asking questions even when you have been asked to ask during the day time ?
[23:12:57] <coldhead> Best Practice is to have my_cute_script.js
[23:13:01] <coldhead> and put it in there
[23:13:16] <coldhead> inside a $(document).ready(function () {...});
[23:13:32] <prefixed> coldhead I'm not clear on what I do (bear in mind that I haven't worked on js/jquery stuff in forever)
[23:13:34] <coldhead> then <script src="my_cute_script.js">
[23:13:56] <prefixed> should I just do <script>$('marquee').marquee(optionalClass);</script> in head?
[23:14:02] <coldhead> er
[23:14:03] <prefixed> will that accomplish what I need?
[23:14:06] <coldhead> you CAN do it that way
[23:14:12] <coldhead> you WILL need to wrap it in ready() as above
[23:14:28] <coldhead> because otherwise it will run immediately, and there will be no marquee loaded to apply to
[23:14:42] <coldhead> .ready() says yo jquery, do this stuff when we have content
[23:14:43] <coldhead> ?ready
[23:14:43] <bot-t> .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[23:15:22] <coldhead> dr0id: >: |
[23:15:25] <prefixed> so this should do it? <script>$(document).ready(function () {$('marquee').marquee(optionalClass);});</script>
[23:15:31] <coldhead> the sun is beating down on you right now, i know it
[23:15:42] <coldhead> yes except don't use optionalClass
[23:15:45] <coldhead> unless you need it
[23:15:51] <coldhead> (you probably don't)
[23:15:54] <prefixed> I don't
[23:15:57] <prefixed> ok
[23:15:58] <coldhead> ?cc
[23:15:58] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[23:16:06] <prefixed> man, I forgot all about jquery
[23:16:12] <coldhead> FOR HOW MUCH LONGER CAN I HOWL INTO THIS WINNND
[23:16:49] <coldhead> jquery never forgets about you
[23:17:03] <coldhead> bot-t: tell lionmac_ i will never forget you
[23:17:04] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[23:17:08] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[23:17:08] <bot-t> coldhead, I'm a bot you know..
[23:17:33] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/JujgT/
[23:18:14] <Whirl3d> okay, so the grouping thing works. What if I say Group.prototype.on=$.fx.on;   will I get all the jquery goodness of .on in the object Group?
[23:18:31] <Whirl3d> wait, lemme guess..TIAS
[23:18:35] <mbrevda> Why can't I insert a tr more than once? http://jsfiddle.net/r4cb2/1/
[23:19:34] <coldhead> mbrevda: http://jsfiddle.net/r4cb2/2/
[23:19:39] <coldhead> you need a fresh clone every time
[23:19:57] <coldhead> before() =/= clone() + before()
[23:20:41] <mbrevda> coldhead: thanks. Here is the problem: the 'prev' tr may have been deleted, meaning i have nothing to clone from. How /can/ I store a tr in its complete form for later cloning?
[23:21:07] <coldhead> clone outside the function and then clone the clone inside the fn
[23:21:43] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/r4cb2/3/
[23:22:05] <mbrevda> awesome, thanks!
[23:22:16] <coldhead> quite welcome, good luck
[23:25:00] <c0kemachine> can I use $(".main").add('<style type="text/css">.main{position:relative !important; right:150px !important;}</style>'); to append the html to a div with the class main ?
[23:25:35] <coldhead> no, that's not what add does
[23:25:43] <coldhead> you want to use ?append
[23:25:43] <bot-t> .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[23:26:10] <coldhead> ?add
[23:26:10] <bot-t> .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[23:26:19] <coldhead> that is poorly phrased, bot-t
[23:26:20] <bot-t> coldhead, Changed "that".
[23:26:24] <coldhead> woops
[23:26:31] <coldhead> ?forget that
[23:26:34] <bot-t> coldhead, #7676 (How Can I Be The Only One To Notice THIS!!!!)  jQuery ... - Opened 17 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7676
[23:26:34] <coldhead> ?that that
[23:26:35] <bot-t> thank a lot yu deserve a great that that
[23:26:40] <coldhead> bot-t: forget that
[23:26:40] <bot-t> coldhead, Forgot "that".
[23:27:02] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[23:27:02] <bot-t> coldhead, I'm a bot you know..
[23:27:39] <coldhead> you are a bot that i know, correct
[23:28:00] <Whirl3d> you forget eval()
[23:28:25] <coldhead> ?eval
[23:28:26] <bot-t> coldhead: Syntax: ? eval <javascript code>
[23:28:56] <coldhead> ?eval alberto = alert; alberto('lol');
[23:28:57] <Whirl3d> ?eval($(bot-t).is($(coldhead).data("friendthatiknow")))
[23:28:58] <bot-t> coldhead: "lol"
[23:28:59] <bot-t> Whirl3d, Couldn't find "eval($(bot-t).is($(coldhead).data("friendthatiknow")))" in jQuery Docs.
[23:29:22] <mbrevda> coldhead: is there any way to clone the object so that any previously applied jquery stuff (specifically formatting applied by jquery) get copied along
[23:30:17] <coldhead> ddepends on what is applied and how
[23:30:23] <coldhead> check the docs for clone
[23:30:24] <coldhead> ?clone
[23:30:25] <bot-t> .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[23:30:35] <coldhead> you want .clone(true) probably
[23:30:41] <coldhead> and lashings of luck
[23:31:42] <mbrevda> I cant find the selector for extra luck. Ive tried every combination of clone(true). Should that be on the first clone, the second or both?
[23:31:53] <coldhead> both
[23:32:31] <mbrevda> not giving me what I wanted...
[23:34:36] <coldhead> this is where the luck comes in
[23:34:40] <Whirl3d> .clone(true, true)
[23:34:44] <coldhead> you may be using a stupid plugin
[23:34:56] <coldhead> which doesn't handle cloning
[23:35:14] <coldhead> in which case you probably need to reapply it to the cloned elements after um insertion
[23:47:20] <mbrevda> no pluggins, I trued true, true
[23:48:21] <Whirl3d> mbrevda, you are gonna have to share some code in a fiddle. Otherwise we are just guessing.
[23:49:12] <Whirl3d> And though coldhead has a 98% psychic success rate, it usually takes a while to figure out how he was right in the first place. But 98% is pretty good, all things considered.
[23:50:36] <mbrevda> seems my first clone is firing before the 'stuff that I want' is happening to the element that is being cloned
[23:50:55] <mbrevda> i.e. the clone is of raw html, which isnt, technically, wrong
[23:51:57] <mbrevda> I have a $('selector').each() set to fire on each element that matches, and that get fired once on page load. Is there anyway to make .each() live?
[23:52:01] <Whirl3d> are you cloning the html element or the jquery object selecting the element
[23:52:42] <Whirl3d> not really. I thought that was how it worked by default for the longes time, but no.
[23:52:58] <mbrevda> http://jsfiddle.net/r4cb2/3/
[23:55:01] <Whirl3d> what are you tyring to do?
[23:57:42] <mbrevda> Whirl3d: clone a tr. The first td has some special formatting applied to it. I would like that to be cloned as well
[23:58:08] <joyz> i have a question about the :not selector, is it possible to select the padding of an element but not the child(ren) for a click function ?
[23:59:54] <coldhead> joyz: you need do to .click(function (e) {...
