[00:46:56] <greves> having a bit of trouble getting a simple animation to work. it works in my codepen (http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vGJJXP) but on my own page on local machine, the same code does not animate smoothly, the timing works but there is no easing so the "before" div simply disappears and "after" simply appears - any tips?
[01:10:26] <hhee> guys, what does it mean .click(function(evt {  im newbie in js. i read that is function. and click event. but why doesn't use just anonymous function?
[01:10:53] <hhee> sorry .click(function(evt) {  ---whats right
[01:14:01] <greves> what?
[01:16:36] <hhee> greves, why jsut not write .click(function() {
[01:17:06] <greves> hhee: the event parameter in that function is the click event, in case you need to handle in
[01:17:08] <greves> handle it*
[01:17:41] <greves> typical use case would be to prevent the default action from happening: .click(function (e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[01:19:20] <hhee> greves, tnx, i'll try do understand this. exactly it means - do not run function just in time as it was defined?
[01:19:32] <greves> what?
[01:19:38] <greves> no
[01:19:57] <hhee> sorry for those querstion, im newbie :)
[01:20:16] <greves> yeah its ok, but do you know the basics like what a function is?
[01:20:28] <hhee> greves, i think - yep
[01:20:37] <greves> and a callback?
[01:20:39] <greves> and an event?
[01:20:47] <hhee> yep
[01:21:44] <hhee> callback - is which function or action run inside other function
[01:21:51] <hhee> event - like mouse click
[01:21:54] <hhee> ?
[01:22:41] <greves> it doesn't run inside another function, a callback is a function that gets called at a certain unknown point in the future
[01:23:07] <hhee> greves, got it
[01:23:16] <greves> so for .click(callback), callback is a function, and it will be called (like: callback() ) after the event happens, but you dont know when
[01:23:56] <greves> and for the .click method, the callback function takes the event as a parameter, the mouse click in this case
[01:31:36] <hhee> greves, tnx for explanation. i put the code here http://pastebin.com/fiDvQv0c
[01:32:16] <hhee> greves, not see function evt - was be defined?
[01:32:33] <hhee> its about 9 line
[01:32:59] <hhee> not understand exactly (evt) thing :)
[01:33:41] <greves> hhee: what language do you speak?
[01:34:43] <hhee> greves, russian native. dont be angry, i'm learning js and jquery just 2nd day.
[01:35:02] <greves> haha not angry just would try to explain in your language but i dont speak russian
[01:35:58] <hhee> greves, i understand what you wrote me. tnx for it a lot :) but what (evt) just not understand it. where in code it uses?
[01:36:19] <greves> hhee: oh. well you're not using the event to do anything in that code
[01:36:39] <greves> you can use it if you need to, but you're not right now
[01:38:19] <hhee> greves, it's example from js tutorial. and i try to understand it from line to line. then, in my case - i dont have to use (evt). just simple drop (evt) from code? it tricks me
[01:39:40] <hhee> greves, tnx for your support!
[01:40:07] <greves> hhee well, that event is getting passed to the callback function no matter whether you write it or not
[01:40:15] <greves> so, you should leave it there as a reminder
[01:41:12] <rito> sup
[01:41:18] <hhee> greves, ok tnx.

[03:25:23] <neanderslob> hi everyone, I have a sidebar that expands over mouseover  Once it expands to its full width I would like for the some text to appear.  The problem is that, as I currently have it configured, if I casually mouseover it and remove my arrow before the box expands, the text appears in the unexpanded box
[03:25:32] <neanderslob> how might I prevent this from happening

[08:00:54] <Simplar> Hello. I'd like to know how it's possible to know if an image in the remote website exists or not by using jQuery. Thanks!
[08:28:38] <decx> Simplar: just create an image and listen of load or error
[08:28:45] <decx> for
[08:29:04] <Simplar> decx: thanks, it worked
[08:30:04] <decx> that was fast
[09:09:50] <puneet28> Hello, I'm looking for a calendar library to display current month and next two months and each date should be clickable. any links?
[09:11:14] <decx> jquery ui datepicker has a numberOfMonths property
[09:12:03] <hellyeah> puneet28:  check the example in jquery ui datepicker page
[09:12:18] <hellyeah> there is example that targets your request exactly
[09:12:27] <hellyeah> numberOfmonths is key
[09:13:06] <hellyeah> puneet28:  check examples here https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[09:14:23] <puneet28> hellyeah: Thanks. I don't want a datapicker. I would like to show all three months together or on arrow click. It is for appointment booking portal. So i can click on each date.
[09:14:41] <puneet28> hellyeah: does that make sense?
[09:15:01] <puneet28> hellyeah: http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex7/basiccalendar.htm something like this
[09:15:12] <hellyeah> you can put input box here
[09:15:18] <hellyeah> and show the calendar
[09:15:21] <hellyeah> humm
[09:15:41] <puneet28> but each day can be clickable
[09:15:55] <hellyeah> i can suggest you something else
[09:16:27] <hellyeah> puneet28:  before this
[09:16:40] <hellyeah> i need to meantion that you can use datepicker inside div
[09:16:46] <hellyeah> that show calendar
[09:17:06] <hellyeah> and you can hide the div and when you click something you can show three calendar together
[09:17:13] <hellyeah> not sure calendar is clickable
[09:17:16] <hellyeah> or
[09:17:48] <hellyeah> check this if it helps http://jqwidgets.com/jquery-widgets-demo/demos/jqxdatetimeinput/index.htm
[09:18:33] <hellyeah> puneet28:  will you use range of dates?
[09:19:26] <puneet28> hellyeah: range of dates? from to? nope
[09:19:38] <hellyeah> ah okey i just asked
[09:20:55] <puneet28> hellyeah: that widget is again a date picker right?
[09:21:41] <hellyeah> seems
[09:21:53] <hellyeah> ah sorry
[09:21:56] <hellyeah> wrong suggestion
[09:22:06] <hellyeah> i would suggest jqx calendar puneet28
[09:22:12] <hellyeah> here is simple example http://jsfiddle.net/jqwidgets/M79ze/
[09:25:10] <puneet28> hellyeah: Thanks. any way to make day clickable? Also, can I restrict user from navigating to last month (feb) and not go further then May?
[09:29:36] <hellyeah> puneet28:
[09:29:40] <hellyeah> you should check api
[09:29:54] <hellyeah> there is disable dates probably also option for month
[09:30:03] <hellyeah> but i am sure you can disable some dates
[09:30:31] <hellyeah> check API first rule
[09:30:34] <hellyeah> :)
[09:32:17] <puneet28> hellyeah: thanks :)
[09:59:02] <Ackis> Hey everyone - I'm trying to deal with some ajax queries and promises - I've figured out query.done.fail syntax and when.apply - I'm trying to find something that lets me run some code before the query starts
[10:05:23] <mrchris> Can anyone recommend a simple replacement for jQuery Tools Overlay feature?
[10:13:15] <Duikb00t> Hello I made this ugly script: https://www.pastery.net/gpxmnp/  Which works , wauw!
[10:13:33] <Duikb00t> But i Was thinking.. is it possible to reset it? Now I can just hover the animation plays but then it stops...
[10:14:22] <decx> hover has 2 cb functions
[10:15:35] <Duikb00t> Wel yes i know but now sure how to attach them
[10:15:37] <Duikb00t> the hanlderIn andout
[10:41:43] <Koopz> yoh!
[10:42:44] <Koopz> i'm doing a $.post() and the response is a CSV file... how do i let the browser do the download thingie?
[10:43:11] <Duikb00t> headers Koopz
[10:43:13] <Duikb00t> contet types
[10:43:16] <Duikb00t> content* types
[10:43:24] <Koopz> i mean how do i do the output?
[10:43:49] <Koopz> .done(function(data){//idk what to do here});
[10:44:39] <Koopz> that CSV file should be in data... right?
[10:45:25] <Koopz> it's not like the browser just gives a damn and shows the download dialog after doing a sneaky jquery post
[10:45:28] <Duikb00t> I think you have to force the download from the php side?
[10:45:32] <Koopz> or does it?
[10:45:40] <andywww> Guys Iâ€™m stuck on passing functions as parameters for callbacks. On the following code, i want to make a function which calls the geocoder and passes one of the parent objects own functions as a callback. Is this possible? How would i best go about it?
[10:45:41] <andywww> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9f86cac65f3279b6686fd1eed1468d0b
[10:46:41] <Duikb00t> I guess, you have to specify a location in your .php file which should handle the download Koopz
[10:48:21] <Koopz> but that file isn't saved on the server's disk
[10:49:27] <Duikb00t> I am always PRO  generating it server side but have a look at : http://jsfiddle.net/terryyounghk/KPEGU/
[10:49:37] <Duikb00t> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16078544/export-to-csv-using-jquery-and-html
[10:49:38] <Koopz> ...could i do a POST in a new tab?
[10:50:19] <Koopz> that file is being generated on server side
[10:50:37] <Duikb00t> your file?
[10:50:49] <Koopz> the CSV file generated by the $.post()
[10:51:05] <Koopz> or rather the response to the $.post()
[10:51:41] <taplar> andywww: hey, you'd need to use your MapSO namespace
[10:51:50] <Koopz> i just need to let the browser download the file and reload the page afterwards
[10:51:51] <Duikb00t> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13039178/download-a-file-built-in-php-output-buffer-from-ajax-call   Koopz Latest answer
[10:52:18] <Duikb00t> Well... keep the reloading part for later.
[10:52:23] <Duikb00t> Start with the downloading part of the file.
[10:53:54] <Koopz> that requires GET
[10:54:11] <Koopz> that file is only being generated on POST
[10:56:04] <Koopz> ...forms can have a target attribute?...
[10:56:16] <taplar> believe so
[10:56:26] <Koopz> now that's convenient
[10:59:08] <Koopz> the only disadvantage is the blank window afterwards...
[10:59:22] <Koopz> do i even need the target?... *tests*
[10:59:58] <Koopz> apparently
[11:00:08] <Koopz> unless...
[11:04:15] <Koopz> nope... how do i reload the page after a form got submitted?
[11:04:56] <Koopz> form being submitted the classic way
[11:06:15] <taplar> should cause the page to reload.  what are you doing to subvert that?
[11:09:03] <Koopz> posting to a different URL which's response is a file
[11:09:08] <Koopz> therefore no page
[11:09:35] <taplar> k, so you'd have to trigger the reload programmatically then
[11:09:57] <Koopz> yep
[11:10:43] <Koopz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13811100/how-to-use-jquery-to-submit-a-form-and-then-reload-the-page
[11:10:52] <Koopz> found this but the 0 didn't work
[11:11:09] <Koopz> changed it to 1000 and i got the result
[11:11:38] <Koopz> but that solution isn't really satisfying... what if the POST takes longer?
[11:12:02] <Koopz> the page just reloads and the download doesn't show up
[11:13:52] <NoiseEee> Koopz: once you send a form off to be processed... you're sending them to a new document. a new http address.
[11:14:00] <NoiseEee> Koopz: you no longer have control of the browser.
[11:14:20] <NoiseEee> Koopz: the 'form processing' page can redirect you to the page you're coming from
[11:14:34] <NoiseEee> Koopz: or, instead of a traditional form submission, you can send it over xhr/ajax.
[11:14:40] <Koopz> it can't since it's serving a file
[11:14:53] <Koopz> redirect + file serving?
[11:15:03] <taplar> i wonder if you can target the form submit to an iframe and have a load event handler that reloads the parent page
[11:15:21] <NoiseEee> so whats the action here - you want a form sent, and the info on that form is used to create a file you want the user to download?
[11:15:44] <Koopz> right
[11:16:00] <Koopz> and afterwards the page needs to reload
[11:16:41] <Koopz> or i need to get redirected to the same page
[11:16:46] <NoiseEee> so really the only way, is to have your form processor page redirect back to that page (the "reload"),  with the filepath or some other ID as a parameter... ie:   originalForm.php?loadFile=12345
[11:16:47] <Koopz> whatever is easier
[11:17:20] <NoiseEee> and as an onload, JS looks for the "loadFile" param, or filepath, and opens that in a new window, which will prompt the download/close the 'new' window
[11:18:10] <taplar> i'd be curious if the iframe approach worked
[11:18:34] <NoiseEee> mebbe
[11:19:31] <Koopz> with your approach i can't avoid saving that file temporarily on the server's disk, right?
[11:20:55] <Koopz> that iframe thing sounds really nasty
[11:21:05] <taplar> how so?
[11:21:20] <Koopz> 'cause it involves iframes^^
[11:21:30] <Koopz> i don't like iframes
[11:21:31] <taplar> gotta stop hating tech, :P
[11:22:11] <taplar> just try it.  put an iframe on the page with a width and height of 0, give it a name and target that name with your form submit, see if that does the download prompt
[11:22:26] <taplar> then if that works, try attaching a load event handler to it to do the page reload
[11:22:56] <Koopz> to the load event of the iframe?
[11:22:59] <taplar> yep
[11:23:33] <NoiseEee> that might work, that's the old way to 'upload' a file via 'ajax'
[11:23:46] <NoiseEee> the form targeting
[11:25:24] <rando> o/
[11:26:59] <rando> is there any way to check if a jQuery element has any data attributes, that start with, say data-wysihtml5. Eg to check for data-wysihtml5-command, data-wysihtml5-dialog and so on. Just need a sible true/false check
[11:28:28] <rando> simple*
[11:28:40] <NoiseEee> $('[data-wysihtml5]') @ rando
[11:28:59] <NoiseEee> oh wait, starts with that?
[11:29:20] <taplar> .* on the end maybe?
[11:29:41] <Koopz> $('#download-helper').on('load', function() { window.location.reload();)}; reloads every second... what am i doing wrong? o3o
[11:29:53] <Xatenev> Is there any workaround to detect if a user closes a tab?
[11:29:56] <Xatenev> ._.
[11:29:58] <NoiseEee> rando: not easily i don't think so
[11:30:03] <NoiseEee> Koopz: why is that even there?
[11:30:18] <NoiseEee> Xatenev: just the onbeforeUnload event
[11:30:26] <Koopz> you said i should attach a load event handler to the iframe
[11:30:27] <Xatenev> NoiseEee: yea but it always triggers when you switch to any page
[11:30:34] <rando> taplar: nope... and the first would get me all elements, right? I already have an element I want to check...
[11:30:35] <Xatenev> NoiseEee: so im wondering if theres any workaround to detect ONLY a tab close
[11:30:37] <Xatenev> I guess not? :\
[11:30:44] <NoiseEee> Xatenev: no
[11:30:46] <taplar> Koopz: attach that in the submit handler of the form
[11:31:16] <Xatenev> NoiseEee: so theres absolutely no way to detect whether I wnana close the tab or just navigate to another link
[11:31:16] <taplar> or you may have to have the iframe display none to keep it from trying to load until your ready
[11:31:18] <Koopz> preventDefaults of the Form submit, attach handler and submit form...
[11:31:36] <NoiseEee> Xatenev: not as far as i know
[11:31:44] <Xatenev> wow
[11:31:46] <Xatenev> :O
[11:32:06] <NoiseEee> Xatenev: http is stateless. if you need state save state somewhere permanent
[11:32:40] <Xatenev> yea
[11:32:45] <Xatenev> i guess i gonna have to step away from js
[11:32:50] <Xatenev> and save it into a session php-wise
[11:32:53] <rando> NoiseEee: god darn it then... any reccomendations?
[11:33:36] <NoiseEee> rando: if you know which ones are out there, search for each of them, otherwise i think you;d have to regex for attributes
[11:33:41] <NoiseEee> k i gotta get work done
[11:33:53] <shoky_> rando: if you really really need that... $elem.is((i, elem) => Array.from(elem.attributes).filter(attr => attr.specified).filter(attr => attr.name.startsWith('data-wysihtml5')).length > 0)
[11:33:55] <shoky_> ;p
[11:34:15] <decx> needs more arrows
[11:34:38] <NoiseEee> es666
[11:34:46] <shoky_> =>:-|
[11:36:25] <shoky_> dunno why i used .is() but oh well
[11:39:29] <Koopz> taplar, the download worked, but it didn't reload
[11:40:00] <taplar> and you have your load event on the iframe that's doing the reload() call?
[11:41:05] <NoiseEee> (reloading the parent at that)
[11:41:11] <taplar> ^
[11:41:14] <NoiseEee> (not just the iframe)
[11:42:33] <Koopz> https://gist.github.com/Koopzington/25547c2f9994dbb7512cea44e26cfe89
[11:42:35] <Koopz> like that?
[11:42:44] <jak2000> hi all
[11:43:04] <jak2000> how to append a text to a div, with add a carriage return(<br>)?  here my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/8Ltaou9j/2/
[11:43:37] <taplar> Koopz: don't think you need .parent
[11:44:37] <Koopz> doesn't reload without .parent either
[11:44:53] <taplar> blah
[11:45:04] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 <br> and carriage returns are different.
[11:45:06] <robertmaxrees> which do you want?
[11:45:06] <Koopz> i'll log something to the console to see if it even gets called
[11:45:23] <NoiseEee> jak2000: use CSS to style stuff, not <br> tags
[11:45:24] <taplar> and the target="blah" on the form matches your iframe name="blah" ?
[11:46:21] <Koopz> yep
[11:46:26] <Koopz> no console output...
[11:47:20] <taplar> so the load event didn't fire
[11:47:27] <taplar> ?
[11:47:31] <Koopz> exactly
[11:47:47] <Koopz> just did some alerts before and after attaching the load event
[11:47:52] <Koopz> they fired
[11:48:09] <taplar> i wonder if since it's an attachment it doesn't fire the event
[11:48:24] <taplar> well, that's it for my idea, ^_^
[11:48:44] <Koopz> <iframe name="download-helper"></iframe> <form target="download-helper"></form> right?
[11:48:56] <taplar> i believe so
[11:55:10] <Koopz> the POST doesn't even show up in my network tab on FF
[11:55:25] <Koopz> gotta check if that happend without the target too...
[11:55:52] <ezek2k4> Hi
[11:56:06] <taplar> aloha
[11:56:14] <Koopz> wtf
[11:56:19] <Koopz> no POST
[11:57:13] <ezek2k4> i have a line of code i can post it here?
[11:57:22] <Koopz> is it long?
[11:57:22] <ezek2k4> i know with multiple i have to use fiddle or soemthing
[11:57:24] <ezek2k4> no
[11:57:36] <robertmaxrees> ezek2k4 sure - generally better to just use a paste service but knock ourself out
[11:57:39] <ezek2k4> $( "#origin ,#loading_place, #destination,#discharge_place").autocomplete({...
[11:57:52] <ezek2k4> just to see how i can select the one input that is selected
[11:57:58] <ezek2k4> when something changes
[11:58:05] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:58:23] <ezek2k4> yes its an autocomplete for all those fields
[11:58:25] <taplar> in your autocomplete methods, 'this' should be the focused element
[11:58:27] <ezek2k4> i mean input
[11:59:03] <ezek2k4> i tried this let me check again
[11:59:13] <Koopz> or $(this)
[11:59:25] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is just a jquery-fied version of this
[12:01:14] <ezek2k4> ill do a fiddle will be easier
[12:01:33] <Koopz> ik but i thought the widget might've added the input to it... but the API apparently doesn't have it...
[12:01:56] <Koopz> so idk how to access the original input element... anyways.. i'm out...
[12:06:25] <ulstr> ahh it's a wonderful day
[12:13:29] <NitroLiq> Hi All, has anyone here used touchswipe.js with jqueryUI?
[12:18:14] <Sal> how can i put the body of these functions in their own named function: http://pastebin.com/SiW3ecRk
[12:19:05] <Sal> i mean, instead of having methodA: function() {...} i would mlike to have methodA: func1(par)
[12:19:19] <Sal> but i know its not the right way of doind it
[12:19:24] <Sal> doing
[12:23:12] <Jagst3r15> Anyone have any idea why the first location's info is not being loaded into the infowindow? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/VazKXJ?editors=1010
[12:23:19] <Jagst3r15> it is loading the third one
[12:23:39] <Jagst3r15> I have the variable infoWindowContent but I don't know why on load it is grabbing the third
[12:23:53] <decx> oh look it that problem i totally solved yesterday
[12:24:07] <taplar> Sal: huh?
[12:24:40] <Sal> i have an inline function, need to let it be in its own named function
[12:24:42] <Jagst3r15> I was in here yesterday but I had some internet problems
[12:24:53] <decx> you do it as you would anywhere else Sal
[12:25:00] <decx> blah: function blaher()
[12:25:18] <decx> Jagst3r15: this is where we ended up https://jsfiddle.net/decx/ssdjq6up/
[12:25:32] <Sal> yes, and then in the var methods?
[12:25:55] <decx> same
[12:26:05] <decx> var blah = function blaher()
[12:26:25] <taplar> i'm confused as to why you'd name a function your assigning to a name already...
[12:26:30] <Sal> now i have var methods={methodA: function() {..body..} };
[12:26:41] <decx> makes it clearer in the debugger taplar
[12:27:06] <Sal> i want it to be: var methods={methodA: myFunc(par)};
[12:27:25] <decx> how often do i have to repeat the same thing?
[12:27:28] <taplar> you can do that, but myFunc is going to be an invocation
[12:27:33] <Sal> is that possible? because i'm trying it and it executes the function even if i don't call it
[12:27:34] <taplar> with that syntax
[12:27:56] <Sal> taplar, ok, thats what i mean
[12:28:05] <Sal> whats the correct syntax then?
[12:28:06] <decx> if you just want to reference you dont use () to execute the function
[12:28:15] <decx> reference an existing functiion that is
[12:28:25] <Sal> i want it to be: var methods={methodA: function(par) { myFunc(par) }};
[12:28:30] <Sal> something like that?
[12:28:40] <decx> bind
[12:28:47] <decx> if you dont care about this
[12:28:59] <taplar> methodA: myFunc
[12:29:02] <taplar> :/
[12:29:07] <decx> myFunc.bind(0, par)
[12:29:11] <Sal> decx, ok, but the parameterws? how can i pass parameters then?
[12:29:28] <decx> notice that bind will override this
[12:29:36] <decx> first argument in bind
[12:29:51] <decx> if you want to keep this then wrap it in an anonymous function
[12:30:41] <Sal> var methods={methodA: myFunc.bind(0, par)};
[12:30:44] <Sal> is that it?
[12:31:00] <decx> right that would reference myFunc and use 0 as this and par as the first argument of myfunc
[12:31:15] <taplar> if your going to be invoking methodA with methodA(something), and you want it to do myFunc(something) as a result, you can just do methodA: myFunc
[12:31:19] <taplar> you don't have to specify the inputs
[12:31:31] <decx> true
[12:32:12] <taplar> Sal: what is the problem your trying to solve?
[12:32:38] <Sal> its that the body of the inline functions are getting too big
[12:32:47] <Sal> so the var methods is getting unreadable
[12:32:54] <Jagst3r15> decx but on load how do you set the marker and the location to the first "Headquarters 1" https://jsfiddle.net/ssdjq6up/1/
[12:33:08] <Jagst3r15> sorry the marker and the info window
[12:33:28] <taplar> so yeah, you can refactor them out into their own named methods and do key: newNamedFunction and it'll be broken up a bit more
[12:34:16] <taplar> calling 'key' will work just as if you were calling newNamedFunction directly, cause in essence you are
[12:34:18] <decx> Jagst3r15: just execute the click function once
[12:34:36] <Jagst3r15> not sure what you mean?
[12:36:00] <decx> well the logic is in the click on the location boxes
[12:36:37] <Jagst3r15> yeah but how would we make that fire on load to show the first one's marker and infobox
[12:36:59] <decx> end of markerstuff when all the necessary info is there
[12:37:38] <Jagst3r15> i'd need to programatically trigger a click?
[12:38:01] <decx> that or just execute the function
[12:39:23] <Jagst3r15> decx like markersStuff().trigger( "click" ); ?
[12:39:43] <decx> think about it a bit longer ;)
[12:39:49] <Jagst3r15> ok
[12:41:36] <Sal> taplar, thanks, i got it
[12:50:24] <ezek2k4> is jquery embed on fiddle by default or we need to choose something
[12:50:28] <ezek2k4> and jquery ui
[12:50:38] <taplar> you have to choose it
[12:50:42] <decx> click the javascript with the gear next to it
[12:50:49] <ezek2k4> ok
[12:50:51] <ezek2k4> tyvm
[13:01:37] <NitroLiq> For anyone who has used jQueryUI, overriding the default tooltip styles works fine when it's at the root of the style sheet but as soon as I move them within an element with an ID, the styles don't show. Any idea why thi would happen?
[13:02:42] <robertmaxrees> see what's overriding the styles.
[13:02:47] <robertmaxrees> and make sure your selector is still valid.
[13:05:47] <NitroLiq> Yeah, I've been looking in firebug but styles aren't showing up for the tooltips
[13:10:32] <aperyon> Hey all! My question is about click delegation. Ive got 2 features one is user logout on ESC keydown, (on document) and an on-click inline-edit where a form comes up (which is sent with ajax so no input type=submit or button to submit) and it can be sent by pressing enter or restore original content by pressing ESC. Now if this form is up, ESC wont trigger the userlogout in the following way: the form, the form's input is listening
[13:10:32] <aperyon> to the ESC not the document. Here comes the problem. I want a form full of checkboxes, where the checkbox is hidden only the label is shown and by clicking the label there is an effect to show it is selected. Now there is no input which would listen to the ESC. I was thinking of putting the input/label/form listener onto document, but that case it breaks in a way, that if i go to the next cell to edit, the 'prevContent' and the cell
[13:10:33] <aperyon> (input) itself still stays the first one
[13:10:37] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[13:10:52] <aperyon> sorry not click, but keydown delegation :/
[13:11:03] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle of your problem?
[13:11:06] <robertmaxrees> and break it down a little?
[13:11:20] <aperyon> i know its a big thing to absorb
[13:11:30] <aperyon> the inline edit itself is 300 lines
[13:11:33] <robertmaxrees> right, so make a test case :)
[13:11:37] <robertmaxrees> doesn't need to be the whole thing.
[13:11:54] <taplar> inputs don't listen for esc eh?
[13:12:09] <aperyon> im only wondering about how to make a label listen to esc
[13:12:15] <aperyon> input does listen to esc
[13:12:21] <taplar> a <label>?
[13:12:22] <aperyon> but label, since it cant be focused or selected
[13:12:25] <aperyon> yes
[13:12:29] <taplar> try giving it a tab index
[13:12:39] <taplar> should make it focusable iirc
[13:12:40] <aperyon> tab index?
[13:13:01] <taplar> html attribute, tab-index="#"
[13:13:06] <taplar> or no -, i forget
[13:14:29] <aperyon> im gonna try to make a pen of this
[13:14:37] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:15:20] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/0h1kk1eu/
[13:15:31] <taplar> clicked it and hit escape.  captured it
[13:16:36] <aperyon> hmmm this is promising
[13:16:39] <decx> if you have an input selected then it should be in e.target on window keydown
[13:16:39] <aperyon> lets give it a try
[13:16:42] <Jagst3r15> decx sorry my internet is crappy
[13:17:04] <Jagst3r15> I tried adding an on('load'... at the bottom but no luck
[13:17:40] <ezek2k4> https://jsfiddle.net/ew7fgnu2/15/ Ok heres the thing if i do it one by one specifiying the id it works but when i have multiple it doesnt... what it should do is only allows you to have something from the autocomplete list
[13:18:34] <aperyon> works amazing!!!!!!!!!!
[13:18:42] <aperyon> tabindex solved it
[13:18:47] <ezek2k4> i could do it one by one...but...
[13:19:39] <decx> Jagst3r15: check this out then https://jsfiddle.net/decx/ssdjq6up/4/
[13:21:04] <ezek2k4> maybe i'm missing something
[13:21:08] <aperyon> taplar, thank you so much
[13:21:12] <ezek2k4> int he this... i need to specify something
[13:21:15] <aperyon> and all of you for the efforts :)
[13:21:17] <taplar> aperyon: glad it works for you
[13:22:21] <taplar> i forget if I picked up that trick in here or from one of our ux guys
[13:22:30] <Jagst3r15> decx let me study it, thanks
[13:23:17] <aperyon> ezek2k4, your code is just not that easy for me to understand whats it trying to achieve
[13:24:13] <ezek2k4> aperyon if someone doesnt select something from the autocomplete it should erase it
[13:24:35] <ezek2k4> and leave it blank... its like forcing them to use only values in the autocomplete list
[13:24:42] <ezek2k4> theres one working
[13:25:05] <ezek2k4> that i specified by id... but i dont wanna do that for each one... instead have the list like the first example
[13:25:13] <taplar> you know line 19 is doing a binding, yes?
[13:25:24] <aperyon> ezek2k4, im sorry, but there was no need to autocomplete anything
[13:25:34] <aperyon> sorry for the misunderstanding
[13:26:44] <ezek2k4> in the first example with multiple selected?
[13:26:59] <ezek2k4> i mean multiple elements specified by id
[13:28:57] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/ew7fgnu2/22/ hmm?
[13:29:18] <Jagst3r15> decx it looks sweet and makes sense, thanks
[13:29:43] <Jagst3r15> decx the last thing I need to do is if the maker/infowindow are active in the map, hide the box below..any idea on that?
[13:29:57] <ezek2k4> u rock dude :P
[13:30:08] <ezek2k4> was so simple yet i couldnt find the good way of doing it hehe
[13:30:13] <ezek2k4> tyvm
[13:30:38] <aperyon> btw how do you unit test js or jquery?
[13:30:49] <aperyon> i mean how to do you test like clicks?
[13:30:50] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/ew7fgnu2/23/ <-- get rid of that one wrapping
[13:30:56] <ezek2k4> taplar do you belive this is the best way of doing that?
[13:31:21] <taplar> i can't think of a better way right now.  we do something similar in our shop
[13:31:32] <taplar> however your still going to have to validate on the back end
[13:31:39] <ezek2k4> ah good :) tyvm
[13:31:58] <taplar> and i'd suggest giving them all a common class, instead of looking up all those ids
[13:32:36] <taplar> aperyon: what do you mean?
[13:33:13] <taplar> there are different ways depending upon your setup and your testing framework
[13:33:30] <taplar> usually your click will change something, so you could check that what changed should have
[13:33:48] <taplar> if your using jasmine to test they have the ability of spying on methods, so you can verify that something was called
[13:33:57] <taplar> provided you have access to that class
[13:33:59] <taplar> just depends
[13:34:45] <taplar> we write, and i'm trying to encourage, our namespaces so that tests have access to all our private methods so testing is easy
[13:44:05] <aperyon> taplar, it sounds very foreign to me, i think ill postpone this for a while
[13:44:28] <taplar> if testing is new to you i'd suggest you at least dabble
[13:44:41] <taplar> depending on which framework you go with, it can change how you approach writing your code
[13:45:25] <aperyon> what do you mean by framework? like jquery (i know its not a framework really, just a library)?
[13:45:41] <taplar> for instance a couple testing frameworks are qunit and jasminejs
[13:46:01] <taplar> qunit, from my experience is very basic
[13:46:09] <taplar> jasmine has more bells and whistles
[13:46:34] <taplar> if you test with a framework that is very simple, it's going to change the way you think about writing your code.  cause your not going to want to make it a pita to test
[13:48:03] <ezek2k4> taplar did you find a way to fix let say when u select something and then people continue to write it will allow them
[13:48:16] <taplar> hmm
[13:48:35] <aperyon> taplar, my site runs on flask which is python, and the reason for that there is a program behind which is the whole site is about written in python. unfortunatelly its pretty complex to test, cuz its not that easy to determine whether the result is expected or not, so i rather do my tests myself, actually doing the things by hand
[13:48:56] <ezek2k4> i belive thats why the other guy told me to focus the element after u select it
[13:49:04] <taplar> ezek2k4: it erased it for me.  i chose location a and then typed aaaa and focused off and it removed it
[13:50:02] <taplar> aperyon: we're talking about javascript though, which is completely independent from your backend
[13:50:30] <ezek2k4> hmm weird it did it on the fliddle but not on my local server
[13:50:41] <aperyon> taplar, i know, i was just explaining why im not on good terms with testing in general
[13:50:47] <taplar> ah, :)
[13:51:28] <taplar> and yeah, i really should be saying library instead of framework
[13:52:25] <aperyon> taplar, i wish it wasnt like that, i tried it many times to write proper unit tests, but it would be like create n containers of different sizes and then create n items and try to fit them. the contianers should be saved in database cuz thats where the comparison happens if the item fits, so i just rather do it by hand
[13:52:59] <taplar> does python have testing libraries/frameworks?  i'm not familiar with the language personally
[13:53:04] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:53:13] <aperyon> its about the idea only, not the language
[13:53:18] <robertmaxrees> you could pretty easily write your own.
[13:53:29] <robertmaxrees> unit testing is a good thing so long as you write code that accommodates for it.,
[13:54:19] <aperyon> yep its more like build the eiffel tower of matches and unit test the first match placed if its good or not.
[13:54:27] <aperyon> (in my case only)
[13:54:35] <robertmaxrees> still a good idea :)
[13:54:44] <aperyon> ok then :DDD
[13:54:49] <robertmaxrees> helps you verify that you don't break contracts down the road.
[13:54:57] <taplar> what's the saying?  every journey begins with a single step?
[13:55:24] <aperyon> u get my example anyway
[13:55:34] <aperyon> writing tests is just to costy for me right now
[13:55:55] <robertmaxrees> computers doing jobs is cheaper than having humans do them most of the time ;)
[13:55:58] <robertmaxrees> long term cost savings.
[13:56:11] <robertmaxrees> especially because you'll save yourself time and headaches later.
[13:56:13] <aperyon> probably an entire refactoring would be needed on roughly 8k lines
[13:56:19] <aperyon> i know i know
[13:56:34] <aperyon> i wish i new more about unit test when i started my project
[13:56:38] <robertmaxrees> nah, with python you could import your file and instantiate the class and then work through the methods on it.
[13:56:58] <aperyon> i know about python unittest
[13:57:05] <taplar> add tests as you have time, or when you happen to be changing them
[13:57:19] <robertmaxrees> our policy here is that every bugfix gets an accompanying unit test.
[13:57:26] <taplar> yeah
[13:57:41] <robertmaxrees> same with new features.
[13:57:52] <taplar> we have some coverage tools that b* at us
[13:58:00] <robertmaxrees> same here.
[13:58:19] <robertmaxrees> we also have code quality gates and functional tests.
[13:58:42] <taplar> we have fts. what's a code quality gate though?
[13:58:55] <robertmaxrees> check for syntax errors and shit - sonarqube.
[13:59:02] <robertmaxrees> makes sure code is formatted per our standards.
[13:59:06] <taplar> ah
[14:03:36] <Jagst3r15> so I am at a loss about this...if a location is active in the map I would like to remove the div from below but store it and add it back once a user clicks on another location...can someone point me in the right direction? https://jsfiddle.net/ssdjq6up/15/
[14:04:13] <Jagst3r15> I tried storing the location's html as a variable and creating a temporary span and inserting it there but it doesnt really work and is wacky
[14:10:22] <awkwardCough> https://jsfiddle.net/ssdjq6up/16/
[14:10:26] <awkwardCough> one approach
[14:13:03] <Jagst3r15> awkwardCough that kind of works but if you click on them a few times it breaks and the order gets scrambled
[14:14:27] <awkwardCough> take #2 https://jsfiddle.net/ssdjq6up/17/
[14:14:54] <Jagst3r15> let me study it, thnx
[14:15:45] <awkwardCough> np, also maybe dont have your hq's in the water... doesnt seem very client friendly
[14:16:06] <taplar> his clients are fish man
[14:16:09] <taplar> racist...
[14:16:30] <taplar> or speciesest
[14:16:35] <awkwardCough> oh shit sorry sorry, ill check my fish privilege
[14:16:37] <Jagst3r15> the lat and long got screwed for all of these
[14:16:46] <Jagst3r15> i need to fix it on my side
[14:17:08] <awkwardCough> ah okay haha
[14:19:43] <Jagst3r15> awkwardCough the only problem with this method is that this is just the working example, the acutal locations are being spit out in a drupal view that have 3 divs wrapping the info-window-content so if messes up the locations grid because then there are empty divs
[14:20:11] <taplar> so it gets tweaked
[14:20:19] <taplar> the example shows the basic idea
[14:20:46] <taplar> you get to play with it more, :)
[14:21:00] <Jagst3r15> of course
[14:31:03] <jquery225> Hi guys, why this doens't work: jQuery.each(jQuery("div[id^='field-turno-di-lavoro']"), function(index, day) { console.log(jQuery(day + " input"));   });
[14:33:54] <awkwardCough> do a .each off of the first selector
[14:34:03] <Jagst3r15> one sec
[14:34:14] <awkwardCough> jQuery("div[id^='field-turno-di-lavoro']").each(function(){ ... })
[14:34:32] <jquery225> ok
[14:35:40] <Jagst3r15> awkwardCough if you look at the bottom I tried something: http://pastebin.com/ECcn85D4
[14:35:45] <jquery225> it's the same, I receive this error: Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [object HTMLDivElement]
[14:35:47] <Jagst3r15> but after clicking a few times it just stop working
[14:36:14] <taplar> jquery225: 'day' inside the each is going to be an object, not a string
[14:36:24] <jquery225> :(
[14:36:31] <taplar> what are you trying to do?
[14:36:51] <jquery225> to select all the input inside the div starting with...
[14:37:39] <taplar> jQuery("div").filter("[id^='field-turno-di-lavoro']").find('input')
[14:38:01] <jquery225> ok thanks!
[14:38:17] <jquery225> wait
[14:38:31] <jquery225> I have 7 div as days
[14:38:50] <taplar> it'll find all the inputs for them, provided they all have an id that matches the filter
[14:38:57] <jquery225> for any of them I have to check the value of the input
[14:39:16] <jquery225> each day has 4 input
[14:39:22] <Jagst3r15> awkwardCough any idea why that may happen?
[14:39:50] <jquery225> and every 4 input I need to do something
[14:40:13] <jquery225> so I need an iteration around the days starting with
[14:40:29] <jquery225> and inside the function take the 4 inputs value
[14:40:35] <taplar> jQuery("div").filter("[id^='field-turno-di-lavoro']").each(function(){ var dayInputs = $(this).find('input'); ...do stuff with them... });
[14:41:02] <jquery225> ok
[14:41:07] <jquery225> it sounds good!
[14:41:26] <awkwardCough> Jagst3r15: try doing this instead http://pastebin.com/pngVFrzn
[14:41:41] <awkwardCough> instead of the replaceWith if statement logic I mean
[14:42:43] <jquery225> taplar: it works like a charm
[14:42:53] <taplar> cool, :)
[14:42:58] <jquery225> I always forget ".find"
[14:43:29] <jquery225> because I hoped to do "id^='field-turno-di-lavoro'] input"
[14:43:45] <taplar> you could, but you'd lose the segregation between days
[14:44:12] <jquery225> exactly
[14:44:44] <hi-liter99> have the following code https://jsfiddle.net/o4j54vLx/ when the appended divs are clicked nothing happens...
[14:45:14] <Jagst3r15> awkwardCough like I said though, we can't do a display none because Drupal is spitting about markup above the actual info we are pulling and the grid system get's wacky when you display: none an elemtn
[14:45:20] <taplar> hi-liter99: elements must exist at the time of binding for them to work, if your doing direct bindings
[14:45:27] <Jagst3r15> so I think we need to do the replace stuff
[14:45:53] <hi-liter99> taplar: what would be a work around?
[14:45:55] <taplar> hi-liter99: you can use a delegate binding instead of fix that
[14:45:55] <blakespot> I have not previously worked with jQuery plugin structures, and inhereted a filter display system that uses them.
[14:46:07] <blakespot> I need to add a function to one and then call it from the page in an onClick.
[14:46:16] <blakespot> Here is a basic case example in codepen: http://codepen.io/blakespot/pen/YqxjxY
[14:46:36] <blakespot> Am I able to directly call the toggleStream() function from an onClick on the page?
[14:46:53] <blakespot> If so, what is the syntax? Clicking the TEST div shows that the page can't see toggleStream();
[14:47:00] <blakespot> Thanks in advance.
[14:47:19] <taplar> blakespot: you really want to avoid inline bindings
[14:48:28] <taplar> and since the function is declared inside another scope, it's not public
[14:48:57] <awkwardCough> Jagst3r15: when I plugged in your code to a jsfiddle it seemed to work fine with no stopping.
[14:48:58] <blakespot> A whole series of plugins are part of this, wrtitten this way, not by me.
[14:49:08] <blakespot> I can't rewrite the entire thing right now.
[14:49:16] <taplar> i'm simply stating preferred patterns, and limitations
[14:49:27] <blakespot> taplar: So through no extended syntax can I call that toggleStream() function from outside?
[14:49:35] <blakespot> understand
[14:49:40] <taplar> as it is, no
[14:49:43] <jquery225> taplar: this works too ;) console.log(jQuery("#" + jQuery(day).get(0).id + " input"));
[14:49:55] <jquery225> but yours is more elegant ;)
[14:50:18] <blakespot> taplar: I need to manipulate those sessionCategoryFilter arrays though, with a call from a div's onClick.
[14:50:31] <blakespot> Do you have a suggestion that may point me towards a course?
[14:50:31] <taplar> jQuery(day).get(0) isn't doing anything
[14:51:10] <taplar> blakespot: i'd suggest having a method on your plugin that either takes in dom objects, or a selector, and through that let the users tell you which elements to attach that event to
[14:51:18] <jquery225> here is working
[14:51:33] <taplar> jquery225: right, but it's pointless
[14:51:35] <jquery225> if day is an object I take its attr id
[14:51:36] <blakespot> The full version of this code concerns reacting to the clicking of "checkboxes" and changing filter behavior based on that. I must spoof a click to control this existing system with js and not a user click, to repurpose the system elsewhere.
[14:51:42] <taplar> your wrapping the dom element, and then unwrapping it
[14:51:58] <taplar> get() is the inverse of $()
[14:52:13] <taplar> you can just do day.id
[14:52:37] <jquery225> without attr?
[14:52:48] <taplar> id is an attribute of the Element
[14:52:56] <taplar> err, property
[14:52:59] <hi-liter99> taplar: is this what you mean --> $( ".draggable" ).delegate( "p", "click", function() { ... });  ??
[14:53:31] <taplar> hi-liter99: more like $("#tb-name").on('click', '.draggable', function(){ ... });
[14:53:41] <Jagst3r15> awkwardCough This: http://pastebin.com/raw/ECcn85D4 works but the two problems are 1) it stops working once you click on each once and 2) the order of each gets messed up
[14:53:47] <taplar> you bind on a pre-existing parent of the elements
[14:55:42] <taplar> lol, btw if i drop out, or awkwardCough for that matter does, we got a thunder storm going on here, :)
[14:56:02] <taplar> zeus be angry
[14:56:05] <hi-liter99> taplar: ok thanks
[14:56:20] <Side_FX> Is there a simple way to check to see if jquery is loaded on a page?
[14:56:28] <taplar> console.log(jQuery)
[14:56:39] <taplar> or just in your console do jQuery or $
[15:00:23] <awkwardCough> Jagst3r15: okay im still not seeing the problem when I run it in this https://jsfiddle.net/ssdjq6up/18/ is everything the same for you?
[15:02:38] <awkwardCough> you are intending to click on the location-grids below the map right?
[15:03:23] <Jagst3r15> yes
[15:03:37] <Jagst3r15> on my local drupal site it is grabbing the views-row above and detaching it
[15:03:44] <Jagst3r15> but i can only click on the boxes once and not again
[15:03:53] <Jagst3r15> for some reason it wont work more than once for each
[15:08:04] <awkwardCough> I am not able to recreate it, best guess is you have something I don't see. Maybe try to recreate it in a fiddle?
[15:15:45] <Side_FX> Can someone makes sense of this for me, http://wpbin.io/helv3p it's supposed to be how to do ajax through Wordpress with jquery but my knowledge is limited on both, I usually do ajax with javascript.
[15:15:58] <Jagst3r15> https://jsfiddle.net/ssdjq6up/19/ < awkwardCough
[15:16:27] <Side_FX> I don't know how to call it, I have that code in window.onload just to test it, but nothing happens.
[15:23:13] <taplar> Side_FX: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/  has a few examples on there
[15:23:32] <Jagst3r15> any idea awkwardCough ? :(
[15:23:45] <awkwardCough> looking at it now
[15:23:49] <Jagst3r15> ok :)
[15:25:39] <taplar> Side_FX: and just in case your not aware, fwik most wordpress sites run jquery in no conflict mode so you'll have to use 'jQuery' instead of '$' to access it
[15:25:53] <taplar> you can over come this though by putting your code in an iife if you want
[15:26:11] <taplar> jQuer(function($){ ...you can use $ in here now... })
[15:26:16] <taplar> jQuery(function($){ ...you can use $ in here now... })
[15:26:48] <taplar> or (function($){ ..$ valid... }(jQuery))
[15:37:53] <Jagst3r15> awkwardCough I tried changing a few things locally with the detach but can't figure it out..lol
[15:39:57] <awkwardCough> replace replaceWith with a before https://jsfiddle.net/ssdjq6up/21/
[15:40:16] <taplar> ^ awesome
[15:40:40] <decx> why replace stuff ?
[15:41:04] <taplar> *shrug* he didn't like hiding things
[15:42:00] <decx> weird
[15:48:47] <Side_FX> taplar thanks
[15:48:56] <taplar> np
[15:57:03] <Side_FX> Man I am pretty lost
[16:00:18] <taplar> what's got ya confused man
[16:01:47] <Toerkeium> hello everyone
[16:03:13] <Side_FX> Everything basically :)
[16:03:33] <Toerkeium> I have a webpage where users logs in, and I need to show them monetary exchange rates when they change. I want to use some "technique" like comet or somerthing like that, which is pulled from the server. There's no much more information to show on change. What would be the easiest way to do that?
[16:03:53] <Side_FX> Is there a way to get a response without actually connecting to a URL just to see if the function is even working at all?
[16:04:19] <taplar> you might could try hitting 'about:blank'
[16:04:38] <Side_FX> What you mean hitting that?
[16:05:21] <Side_FX> I currently have window.onload = function() {alert("hey"); jQuery(document).ready( function($) {
[16:05:34] <Side_FX> then all the jquery stuff, the hey alert comes up but nothing else happens
[16:07:10] <taplar> is there a reason your using the on load?
[16:08:06] <Side_FX> Just as something to run the code, I just want to get some ajax call working as a test before I add real functionalityh
[16:09:30] <taplar> jQuery(function($){ console.log('hey');  $.post( ... );});
[16:10:27] <Side_FX> Nothing happens when I put that in
[16:10:40] <taplar> your looking at your console?
[16:12:33] <Side_FX> So many errors..
[16:12:40] <taplar> ;)
[16:12:41] <taplar> fix em
[16:14:01] <drej> Side_FX: write less errors
[16:14:03] <drej> duh
[16:14:21] <drej> if only developers would write less bugs
[16:14:25] <Side_FX> It's all from wordpress..
[16:14:52] <drej> that's what you get
[16:14:54] <drej> for using wordpress
[16:15:10] <taplar> jQuery(function($){ console.log('hi'); });
[16:15:24] <taplar> ^ if you put just that and it doesn't run, you have some error that is preventing it from running
[16:16:42] <Side_FX> Yeah nothing seems to be happening.
[16:18:13] <Side_FX> Ok That actually does work
[16:20:27] <Side_FX> Now I put the original thing back and have TypeError: $ is not a function
[16:20:42] <taplar> 'original' ?
[16:21:59] <Side_FX> http://wpbin.io/helv3p
[16:22:18] <taplar> k, i explained earlier why $ isn't recognised on wordpress sites and how you could over it
[16:22:46] <taplar> otherwise you have to use 'jQuery' in every place your trying to use '$'
[16:23:13] <Side_FX> Isn't that when I'm doing?
[16:23:30] <taplar> ln 3
[16:23:32] <Side_FX> Or is it from the nonce?
[16:24:09] <taplar> 'every where' is all inclusive, :p
[16:26:02] <Side_FX> I just deleted that line and now I get no errors and no alerts
[16:26:03] <albedoa> how do you destroy a jQuery object? would you use remove() for that, or is remove only for taking it out of the DOM?
[16:26:26] <taplar> remove() destroys it
[16:26:31] <taplar> detach() takes it out of the dom
[16:26:37] <taplar> *only
[16:26:53] <albedoa> so even if you haven't attached it to the DOM, you can use remove() to destroy it?
[16:27:02] <taplar> just let it go out of scope
[16:27:06] <albedoa> oh right
[16:27:07] <taplar> gc will take care of it
[16:41:44] <taplar> robertmaxrees: did you say april 8th?
[16:44:28] <Gandalf> Hi all. :)
[16:44:37] <taplar> aloha
[16:44:46] <Gandalf> Anyone available to help with a JQuery UI widget factory question?
[16:44:54] <Guest38702> Should be simple, but I'm new to widget factory
[16:45:14] <taplar> go ahead and ask.  if anyone knows they'll pipe in
[16:45:27] <Guest38702> Thanks Taplar
[16:45:52] <Guest38702> Basically, I've written a widget which works well enough. But I'm trying to build it from empty elements that it's called on.
[16:46:28] <Guest38702> Might be easier if I post my Stack Overflow question
[16:46:29] <Guest38702> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36318539/after-a-jqueryui-widget-is-initialised-how-do-i-change-what-is-returned-by-the
[16:47:13] <Guest38702> Basically, I call the widget constructor on an empty element, the original empty element gets replaced by a new DOM element, which I then want to be returned by the chain
[16:47:31] <Guest38702> So:
[16:47:33] <Guest38702> $("#b-accordion-1").bAccordion();
[16:47:37] <Guest38702> on this
[16:47:47] <Guest38702> <span id="b-accordion-1"></span>
[16:48:12] <Guest38702> The span gets replaced by the widget on the page just fine, but the $("xx").bAccordion() function returns the span instead;
[16:55:31] <taplar> i'm not that familiar with the widgit but that may be the intended functionality.  typically methods return the elements they acted upon
[16:55:50] <taplar> what you may be after is the "instance" option: http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/
[17:00:39] <Guest38702> Thanks, Taplar... looking at it now
[17:08:02] <Guest38702> It's actually not clear to me how the .instance() method is meant to be used.
[17:08:13] <Guest38702> It's not even available on the widget
[17:09:10] <taplar> from what i gather in your case it would be $("#b-accordion-1").bAccordion( 'instance' );
[17:09:50] <taplar> after it's been initialized
[17:10:30] <Guest38702> Ah, you're correct
[17:10:31] <Guest38702> Let me retry
[17:12:32] <Radar> Hey all, I have a React component that I'm trying to trigger with jQuery. It has an onMouseDown event, which I can't get to trigger with either .click() or .trigger('mousedown'). What other tricks can I use?
[17:16:50] <taplar> have you tried in #reactjs?  they might have some ideas
[17:18:55] <Guest38702> Taplar - although I didn't get it to work exactly as I wanted it, your suggestion led me to a solution. Thanks :)
[17:19:21] <taplar> awesome
[17:19:26] <taplar> i was spittballin, :D
[17:19:58] <Guest38702> Rader - not sure how things are triggered within react... but if you're just looking to call another function, then those two options should work.
[17:20:11] <Radar> Radar*
[17:20:17] <Radar> Guest38702: If they were working, would I be here?
[17:20:29] <robertmaxrees> jquery events and react events are likely two different domains.
[17:20:34] <robertmaxrees> i'd hit up a react channel and ask there.
[17:20:42] <Guest38702> I assume that the onMouseDown react event is not the same as the event used by jquery.
[17:20:44] <Radar> I'm there now. Thanks.
[17:20:49] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[17:22:15] <taplar> Guest38702: make sure to update your SO, ;)
[17:22:46] <Guest38702> Good point. :) Do you have a handle I can credit?
[17:22:55] <taplar> i'm taplar there too
[17:23:59] <taplar> i'm like fleas.  i'm every where almost
[17:24:14] <Guest38702> hehe
[17:24:35] <Guest38702> If you want some positive rep there, post a quick answer to my question so I can mark it
[17:24:41] <Guest38702> I'm not sure if there's a way to credit you otherwise
[17:24:53] <taplar> it's cool.  you got help. s'all matters
[17:25:25] <taplar> and i didn't have to login to my account.  double win
[17:25:47] <Guest38702> Heh. Thanks a bunch! :D
[17:55:58] * taplar thinks he'll try to make a break while the rain has halted
[19:13:03] <Side_FX> If I have <div id="reflect">Hey whats up</div>  How can I get the inner html?  I tried $("#reflect").html() but this doesn't seem to work?
[19:18:14] <shoky_> Side_FX: that should get the inner html, i.e. "Hey whats up"
[19:32:21] <funhouse> Does anyone here use jquery with angular?
[19:32:36] <funhouse> Or is it just as easy to make a single page app with jquery?
[19:52:31] <robertmaxrees> funhouse jquery and angular do 2 different jobs.
[19:52:49] <robertmaxrees> which is why a lot of people use them together. angular even includes it's own "light" version if you don't already have it on the page
[20:15:16] <funhouse> robertmaxrees: was reading that alot of plugins don't work with angular
[20:15:36] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea - i don't use angular.
[20:15:41] <robertmaxrees> i actively avoid it heh
[20:21:03] <andresousa> why does table.append('<tr>'); table.append('<td></td>'); table.append('</tr>') results into this: <tr></tr><td></td> instead of <tr><td></td></tr> ?
[20:21:24] <robertmaxrees> because jquery closes table.append('<tr>'); for you.
[20:21:53] <robertmaxrees> since leaving tr open is invalid and would cause all kind sof problems.
[20:22:24] <andresousa> what is a proper way to do that?
[20:22:39] <robertmaxrees> just leave off the final append call.
[20:22:39] <robertmaxrees> done.
[20:22:43] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[20:22:49] <robertmaxrees> you need to select the new TR and append to that.
[20:23:02] <andresousa> well i'd like to input various td's inside this tr
[20:23:06] <robertmaxrees> right.
[20:23:14] <robertmaxrees> so you'd select the new tr, store that in a var, and append away.
[20:23:42] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, build up an array of tds you're going to append, add them to a new TR you create at the end of that, and then append all of that.
[20:24:33] <andresousa> well i wasn't sure how to select that tr, should i use add?
[20:24:38] <robertmaxrees> .find()
[20:24:43] <robertmaxrees> but you shouldn't do it that way.
[20:24:46] <robertmaxrees> let me show you what i mean.
[20:25:17] <andresousa> i just didn't want to add any id to it
[20:25:22] <robertmaxrees> right.
[20:25:27] <robertmaxrees> you don't have to :) 1 sec.
[20:26:20] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/edr20tdr/
[20:26:56] <robertmaxrees> basically, manipulate a tr in a fragment (which is basically what $('<tr>') makes) and then append everything all at once when you're done.
[20:27:53] <andresousa> oh haven't realized that it has map() , wow
[20:27:59] <robertmaxrees> what does?
[20:27:59] <andresousa> thanks you very much, i got it :)
[20:28:03] <robertmaxrees> arrays?
[20:28:08] <andresousa> i mean jquery
[20:28:11] <robertmaxrees> err.
[20:28:14] <robertmaxrees> that's not a jquery map there.
[20:28:19] <robertmaxrees> but jquery DOES have a map.
[20:28:46] <andresousa> oh it's a normal js map
[20:28:53] <andresousa> well i neigher realized js has a map too, lol
[20:28:59] <robertmaxrees> HEH
[20:29:00] <robertmaxrees> *heh
[20:29:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  it has a lot of standard methods.
[21:11:41] <mykhailyk> hi, why when i make an array like var arr = ['',''] then printing an element by arr[1] it prints 'undefined' ?
[21:12:19] <mykhailyk> i need an empty string printed
[21:14:47] <shoky> mykhailyk: arr[1] should get the empty string there.  are you doing console.log  from the browser console?
[21:20:39] <mykhailyk> shoky, in a .text(arr[1]) it appears as undefined in div, but in console.log(arr[1]) it shows as an empty string
