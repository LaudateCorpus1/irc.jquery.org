[00:00:09] <raj> alright, guess I'll poor myself a drink too
[00:00:18] <coldhead> pour*
[00:00:19] <raj> otherwise we won't understand each other
[00:00:37] <coldhead> $('.somediv').on('whatever', function () {...}) ?
[00:00:42] <coldhead> why doesn't that do what you need
[00:00:48] <beasty> .live() ?
[00:01:12] * Cork can't wait for live to die
[00:01:27] <beasty> Cork: that's mean :)
[00:01:35] <coldhead> don't talk about live, beasty, you'll upset Cork
[00:01:41] <Cork> that api is so weird
[00:01:58] <Cork> delegate/on is so much more understandable
[00:02:33] <beasty> true
[00:02:35] <coldhead> hindsight is 20:20
[00:02:35] <beasty> but still
[00:03:00] <Cork> and its waistfull as it actaully does a selection on the dom, just to throw the selection away
[00:03:12] <Cork> and then work on document instead
[00:06:19] <Whirl3d> anybody know of a lazy jquery object plugin?
[00:06:35] <Cork> uh, lazy jquery object?
[00:06:39] <Whirl3d> all I can find is lazy loaders.
[00:07:30] <Whirl3d> where the jquery object was only ever selected when needed.
[00:07:52] <Cork> ah, you mean a lazy selector
[00:08:07] <Cork> i don't think you can do that
[00:08:20] <Whirl3d> interesting distinction, I am not sure about that though...
[00:08:27] <Cork> when your running the selector it creates an object that your working on
[00:08:54] <Cork> hmm
[00:09:02] <Cork> scratch that :)
[00:09:07] <Cork> you could use a proxy for the list
[00:09:22] <Cork> but i don't see what it would give you
[00:09:34] <Cork> it would only mean the selector is run later
[00:09:58] <Cork> you would just do it when you know you need it instead
[00:11:22] <patrickvw>  $(".groupItem").click( function() {
[00:11:22] <patrickvw>       var SortIDs  = new Array();
[00:11:22] <patrickvw>       var id = $(this).attr('id');
[00:11:58] <apsillers> Hi all, I discovered some odd behavior, but I'm not sure if it's a bug or intended
[00:12:15] <coldhead> wasteful*
[00:12:29] <coldhead> can you be more specific apsillers
[00:12:41] <patrickvw> How do i get the same id as in previous snipet $(".groupItem div.itemHeader a.closeEl").each(function(){
[00:13:03] <SoulRaven> anybody knows if is posibile to get the colopicker tool from webinspector and applay to the color tag in chrome?
[00:13:05] <patrickvw> It allready took me over an hour
[00:13:06] <Cork> patrickvw: this.id
[00:13:09] <apsillers> if I used the jQuery object for build HTML from a string, $("<a>hello</a>"), it works as expected, unless...
[00:13:38] <Whirl3d> Cork the problem is that you have to know the parameters of the selector to "just do it again" what if you wanted to pass a list of all "checked" elements to a function that didn't know that it was receiving "checked" elements, for example.
[00:13:52] <apsillers> I have raw text (i.e. not tags) at either end of the string, in which case the end text is dropped
[00:14:15] <apsillers> $("hello <a>world</a> bye") gets me just the middle tag
[00:14:21] <coldhead> that's expected behaviour, apsillers
[00:14:29] <coldhead> you need to give well formated html
[00:14:32] <coldhead> or all bets are off
[00:14:38] <apsillers> understood
[00:14:40] <Cork> Whirl3d: do it again? you mean to refresh the selector?
[00:14:48] <apsillers> I thought it might
[00:15:08] <Whirl3d> you said: you would just do it when you know you need it instead
[00:15:16] <patrickvw> Cork: Wow that easy. Youra time saver
[00:15:45] <Cork> Whirl3d: so send the selector to the function and let it use the string when it needs it
[00:16:42] <apsillers> that behavior deviates from what I'd expect based on how innerHTML handles that case, but I can't realyl fault jQuery for not accepting crappy strings
[00:16:44] <apsillers> thanks!
[00:18:06] <Cork> apsillers: $("hello <a>world</a> bye") creates the elements inside it
[00:18:17] <Cork> apsillers: innerHTML works on an element
[00:18:18] <patrickvw> Cork: oops to soon I want the previous id
[00:18:38] <Whirl3d> Cork, I am certainly not saying that there aren't ways to do it without using a "lazy jquery" object, I was just wondering if anyone had done it. I need to go back and find the use case I was working on a couple of days ago. brb
[00:18:39] <Cork> apsillers: $('<div/>').html("hello <a>world</a> bye") would work
[00:18:42] <patrickvw> Cork: How do I get that?
[00:18:47] <apsillers> ah, yes, I can appreciate the difference
[00:19:20] <Cork> patrickvw: you would have to cache the last itteration in a variable
[00:19:54] <Cork> Whirl3d: you would have to ripp out the core of the jquery object, and replace it with a function
[00:20:08] <patrickvw> <div class="groupItem" id="sort0-7">
[00:20:08] <patrickvw>             <div class="itemHeader"><h3>Chatsessie met: <strong>janus</strong></h3><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="closeEl"></a>
[00:20:09] <Cork> Whirl3d: that means every selector you ever used in the page would get a bit of penilty
[00:20:31] <apsillers> Cork: thanks for the clarification, I can see now why my case really doesn't make sense
[00:21:46] <Whirl3d> Cork, that's why I wondered if anyone had written a plugin or extension. I don't want to affect every jquery object ever, I just want to create a js object that behaves like a jquery object but is only evaluated when referenced.
[00:22:07] <Cork> Whirl3d: you would have to
[00:22:26] <Whirl3d> Kind of like a getter/setter....
[00:22:31] <Cork> jquery is built around an array like object, that object would have to be replaced by a getter
[00:22:36] <Cork> yes and getters are function
[00:23:45] <Cork> only way around that would prob be to create a wrapper object that use use, that internaly used the jquery object
[00:24:28] <Cork> *objet and use that,
[00:25:27] <coldhead> object**
[00:25:33] <Cork> opps
[00:25:40] <coldhead> oops*
[00:25:46] <Cork> lol
[00:26:41] <Whirl3d> I'm still having the hardest time wrapping my head around the notion that I can build a jquery object that selects a dom element and then remove the dom element, still manipulate the jquery object.
[00:27:27] <Cork> Whirl3d: think of it as a bunch of elements that build a tree by referencing the parent
[00:27:27] <Whirl3d> I thought for ever that if you removed the dom element, the jquery object wouldcontain [], but that's not the case.
[00:27:43] <Cork> when you remove an element you set the parent to null
[00:27:49] <coldhead> think of it as a torus in hypserspace
[00:29:12] <Cork> Whirl3d: well its a list of references
[00:29:21] <Whirl3d> Cork, that is a great explanation, thank you....
[00:29:50] <Whirl3d> but the thing that's tricky is that I am not manipulating the list if the element s exist. I'm manipulating the elements
[00:30:11] <Whirl3d> but if they happend to not exist, then I am manipulating the list
[00:30:30] <Cork> you could check if the element exist in the document
[00:30:42] <Cork> and if it doesn't you can remove it from the list
[00:31:15] <Whirl3d> certainly. But you can see where it gets confusing....do I need to check every time I manipulate any jquery object?
[00:31:38] <Whirl3d> so that I am not at risk of wasting a lot of tranformations on an element that was already removed
[00:31:47] <Cork> Whirl3d: when you save the output from $() in a variable its a cached result
[00:31:52] <Cork> its not live in anyway
[00:32:08] <Cork> the dom elements it references are though, but not jquery
[00:32:49] <Whirl3d> var el=$("div.something') ;   el.addClass("test') modifies the live element
[00:33:06] <Whirl3d> sry I was typing while you were.
[00:33:56] <Whirl3d> Hence my quest for a lazy jquery object. One that would more closely represent the selector "live" on the dom.
[00:34:20] <Cork> i think you can get the selector from an old jquery object and run it again
[00:36:31] <Cork> Whirl3d: $(object.selector)
[00:36:32] <Whirl3d> I think I need to re-evaluate the way that I cache things.
[00:36:48] <Cork> Whirl3d: or rather object = $(object.selector);
[00:37:38] <Whirl3d> how do you write custom pseudo-selectors?
[00:38:17] <Whirl3d> like :first or :last or...what I want is a :current
[00:39:13] <Cork> http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1457-How-To-Build-A-Custom-jQuery-Selector.htm
[00:39:31] <Whirl3d> you rox. Thanks, as always, Cork.
[00:40:09] <Cork> that ones a bit old though, so not sure if it works in latest jquery
[00:40:42] <Whirl3d> I've seen ajpiano do it in his sleep before. But I neglected to save the info.
[00:40:55] <Cork> :D
[00:41:08] <h4mz1d> is there any insight into preventing an ajax form from submitting more than twice for an interval of time
[00:41:46] <Cork> h4mz1d: make a check in your submit event and exit early if a varaible is set
[00:42:03] <Cork> if($(this).data('disabled')) { return; }
[00:42:22] <h4mz1d> what does disabled reference here?
[00:42:28] <Cork> $('form').data('disabled', true);
[00:42:35] <Cork> just a variable
[00:42:39] <Cork> ?.data
[00:42:40] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[00:42:59] <h4mz1d> thanks
[00:43:55] <poppiez> is it possible to "join" elements? e.g. I have var $first = $('#randomDiv'); var $another = $('#anotherDiv'); $first.$another.hide();
[00:44:08] <poppiez> the last statement is, of course, incorrect
[00:44:09] <Cork> ?.and

[00:44:21] <bot-t> .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[00:44:31] <Cork> it doens't modify the original object though
[00:44:36] <Cork> so don't forget to resave it
[00:44:53] <Cork> var $all = $.first.add($another);
[00:44:58] <Cork> bah
[00:45:01] <Cork> * var $all = $first.add($another);
[00:45:20] <poppiez> can't I just do $first.add($another).hide();? I don't want to modify the variables
[00:45:27] <Cork> you can
[00:45:33] <poppiez> perfect. thx a lot, Cork :)
[00:45:59] <lijzzz> cork please tell me how can i bypass the blur event if i want to fire a button click event
[00:46:29] <Cork> uh..., you can't really
[00:46:42] <Cork> if the element can have focus focus is moved to an element when its clicked
[00:47:08] <lijzzz> can it be done by using settimeout?
[00:47:13] <Cork> you can have your code ignore the blur/focus event, but you can't prevent it
[00:47:26] <lijzzz> this is my case
[00:47:31] <lijzzz> i have a textbox
[00:47:34] <Cork> lijzzz: what is it your trying to do?
[00:47:44] <lijzzz> i have a button to save
[00:47:59] <lijzzz> if i click outside the textbox other than the button, i want blur event
[00:48:17] <lijzzz> if i click the button, i want the button event to fire and not the blur event
[00:48:34] <lijzzz> cork http://jsfiddle.net/eBj27/1/
[00:48:51] <Cork> ah, then ya you would need to use settimeout(function() {},0); and check the active element
[00:49:10] <lijzzz> could you please modigy the code there
[00:49:16] <lijzzz> *modify
[00:50:41] <lijzzz> Cork
[00:52:46] <Cork> hmm, i would prob do it a completly different way
[00:54:47] <Cork> lijzzz: http://jsfiddle.net/eBj27/2/
[00:55:33] <Cork> not sure what element you have for the button you talked about, so that selector needs to be replaced
[00:55:42] <bjensen> I need to implement local jumps like <a href="#top"></a> <div id="top></div>. However this changes the url in my address bar to my page#top, can I implement something similar in jquery that doesnt?
[00:56:02] <Cork> ?.scrollTo
[00:56:03] <bot-t> Cork, .scroll() - Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[00:56:10] <Cork> beep
[00:56:30] <Cork> bjensen: http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/
[00:56:53] <Cork> you can even add animations if you like :)
[00:57:10] <bjensen> does that work with divs that have set style{scroll:overflow}? so that it is the container that needs to be scrolled
[00:57:24] <bjensen> fixed height
[00:57:24] <Cork> yes
[00:57:28] <bjensen> cool. Thanks
[00:57:32] <lijzzz> cork u put an additional focus event right?
[00:57:36] <PavelloZ> bjensen: https://gist.github.com/2349497
[00:57:47] <Cork> lijzzz: i put a focus event instead of the blur yes
[00:57:51] <PavelloZ> yesterday i needed to do something like you with my fixed top nav so here you go
[00:57:57] <Cork> and catch all focus events with it
[00:58:16] <lijzzz> what is the advantage cork?
[00:58:19] <PavelloZ> bjensen: ofcourse you can skip the "- 50" part as its a height of my fixed nav
[00:58:39] <Cork> lijzzz: you will know what element gets the focus, instead of what element loses it
[00:58:49] <bjensen> PavelloZ: cool, thanks
[00:58:56] <lijzzz> b4 coldhead told me to avoid $(document).click
[00:59:41] <Cork> click is another matter
[00:59:56] <Cork> you not really interested if anyone clicks somewhere else, you want to know its focus
[01:00:31] <Cork> lijzzz: and if you checks i use one(), that means it only registeres one focus change
[01:00:38] <lijzzz> cork in the code i gave everything was working but the click event containing the ajax call was firing multiple times as i click on the save button
[01:01:52] <lijzzz> first time when i clicked the button it fired once second time when i click the button it fires twice and so on
[01:02:18] <Cork> ya, your binding events inside the click event
[01:02:27] <Cork> so each time you click it it will bind another listner
[01:02:43] <lijzzz> instead of document click y cant i use button click event
[01:02:54] <lijzzz> if it bypass blur
[01:03:20] <Cork> lijzzz: sounds like your going about this the wrong way
[01:03:43] <lijzzz> please advise me
[01:04:26] <Cork> lijzzz: the ajax call isn't in your code dump, so can't say if these elements are replaced or not
[01:04:45] <Cork> but if they arn't, you should bind once, and instead check if they should act or not
[01:05:07] <Cork> instead of binding every time the abumview-text is clicked
[01:05:41] <lijzzz> that is where the process starts
[01:05:56] <Cork> process?
[01:06:02] <lijzzz> when i click on album text i want to hide that span and show the textbox and button
[01:06:23] <Cork> that doesn't mean you have to bind the event listners there
[01:06:26] <lijzzz> and when i blur the text box i want to show the span and hide textbox and button
[01:06:45] <lijzzz> and when i click on the button i want to make the ajax call
[01:07:01] <lijzzz> and show the span and hide the textbox and button
[01:08:09] <lijzzz> i went for event listeners coz i have many images and titiles in the page, and i want the process i described above to happen for all individual image titiles
[01:08:35] <Cork> use propagated event listners
[01:08:41] <Goopyo> question if I have 3 <div class='a on'> and <div class='b'> and <div class='c'> but I want to make sure that only one is on at any time whats the easiest way to do this?
[01:08:47] <Cork> then you only need one listners for all the elements
[01:09:18] <Goopyo> I know I can toggleClass on a to make switch it on or off, but I want to make sure the other 2 are the opposite of a
[01:09:38] <Cork> Goopyo: $('.on').removeClass('on'); $('.a').addClass('on');
[01:10:09] <Cork> you can't really use toggleClass
[01:10:22] <Cork> as you need to know what direction it goes to check if you want to allow it
[01:10:46] <Goopyo> wait so (.on) grabs all the divs that are on at that time?
[01:10:54] <Cork> yes
[01:10:57] <Whirl3d> $(div.c).siblings(".on").removeClass(".on").end().addClass("on");
[01:11:34] <Cork> if($('.on').length < 1) { $(this).toggleClass('on'); } or something like that
[01:11:35] <Whirl3d> *removeClass("on")
[01:12:13] <Cork> Whirl3d: your asuming they'r siblings :)
[01:12:33] <Whirl3d> true there.
[01:13:50] <bjensen> PavelloZ: thanks. Is there a reason though that if you click the link multiple times you are taken to different places?
[01:13:56] <Goopyo> wait so thats what I was about to ask next, if I have a bunch of these 3 sets of divs in a article container, like <article><div a><div b><div c></aritcle> <article><div a><div b><div c></aritcle>  and so on how I make sure only the ones in the current article are changed?
[01:14:08] <poppiez> when I .off('.namespace'); on an element and then .on('click.namespace', $.noop); it won't bind. if I don't unbind initially, it works. why is this?
[01:14:36] <Goopyo> whirl3d's method right?
[01:14:47] <Cork> Goopyo: $(this).closest('article').find('.on')
[01:15:13] <Cork> Goopyo: or if they'r all siblings do what Whirl3d wrote
[01:15:29] <PavelloZ> bjensen: i doesnt happen to me, if you are using proper internal document linking it should work. elements to scroll have IDs, and the href in anchors is "#ID"
[01:15:37] <Goopyo> cool, ill test it out. Thanks guys!
[01:15:52] <PavelloZ> bjensen: i think it may be a problem with your linking or duplicated IDs
[01:16:35] <bjensen> PavelloZ: the destination nodes do not need to be links, as long as they have the right id right?
[01:16:37] <Goopyo> btw whats that end() for in Whirl3d's method?
[01:16:38] <Whirl3d> Cork, in general, though. How do you manage a system that has a "current" element or "on" element (single element)?
[01:16:49] <PavelloZ> bjensen: destination can by any html element with an ID
[01:16:54] <PavelloZ> and link just points to the #id
[01:17:00] <Whirl3d> the root selector $("div.c")
[01:17:06] <PavelloZ> and the hash part is an important one
[01:17:07] <Cork> Whirl3d: what do you mean?
[01:17:14] <bjensen> ok thanks
[01:17:48] <Whirl3d> $("selector").siblings().css("color","red".end()    ---returns you to $(selector) rather than it's siblings
[01:18:13] <Cork> ya?
[01:18:16] <Whirl3d> *"color","red").end()....    sory
[01:18:24] <Cork> (still doesn't get the question)
[01:18:40] <Whirl3d> Cork, I was replying to Goopyo, sorry
[01:18:48] <Cork> lol
[01:19:20] <Cork> you made me really comfused there :P
[01:19:22] <Goopyo> hmm doesn't seem to work, is this valid? I repalced the div name with this: $(this).siblings(".on").removeClass(".on").end().addClass("on");
[01:19:23] <Whirl3d> Cork, I have a website that has 4 sections. In each section are a number of pages, in each page a number of articles and in each article a number of topics
[01:19:46] <Whirl3d> removeClass("on").... sorrry my type
[01:19:48] <Whirl3d> typo
[01:20:04] <Whirl3d> (no '.' in the removeClass method
[01:20:08] <Goopyo> damn badd asss
[01:20:15] <Goopyo> jquery is pretty tight
[01:20:39] <Nece228> hello is there a function in which element would be moved to desired location on specific event
[01:20:51] <Nece228> in my case button needs to be moved elsewhere on mouseover
[01:21:11] <Cork> Nece228: no you would have to do that your self
[01:21:19] <Nece228> oh
[01:21:21] <Whirl3d> Cork, so on page 5 of the contact section in article 3, for example, I have a link to another section/page/article. I can't decide the best way to unload the current section/page/article and load the new one....
[01:21:25] <Nece228> then jquery sucks
[01:21:31] <Cork> heh
[01:21:41] <Goopyo> thanks Cork  and Whirl3d
[01:21:45] <DannyZB> Nece288: it's a question of moved -how
[01:21:46] <Cork> Nece228: if you want it animated thats provided though
[01:22:07] <DannyZB> Nece: Do you use absolute positioning for it ? or do you want it moved after another element ?
[01:22:34] <bjensen> PavelloZ: your links are also on the form: <a href="#foo">goto foo</a> ?
[01:23:21] <Nece228> DannyZB: i just want to move it to specific pixels
[01:23:38] <Whirl3d> Goopyo, 8)
[01:24:48] <PavelloZ> bjensen: yes
[01:25:03] <DannyZB> Nece288 : do you have jQuery UI ?
[01:25:04] <PavelloZ> and i point to the div#id
[01:25:16] <PavelloZ> different sections of long page
[01:26:49] <Nece228> DannyZB: no
[01:27:35] <Nece228> DannyZB: i think i figured this out by myself...
[01:28:37] <poppiez> when I .off('.namespace'); on an element and then .on('click.namespace', $.noop); it won't bind. if I don't unbind initially, it works. why is this?
[01:28:47] <DannyZB> Nece228: you create a CSS style for the new positioning and then use "addClass" from jQuery
[01:28:57] <DannyZB> it's cleaner than accessing positioning data directly
[01:29:22] <Nece228> DannyZB: ok ill see
[01:29:44] <Goopyo> Q: Does the object (this) change once I go into the ajax.done() function?
[01:29:46] <Nece228> btw is something like $(this).style.top valid?
[01:29:52] <Goopyo> http://jsfiddle.net/KD8hu/
[01:30:09] <DannyZB> Nece228: $(something).css("top","250px");
[01:30:24] <DannyZB> again , you'd rather use a CSS class .. easier to work with later you'll thank me
[01:30:26] <Nece228> oh thanks for figuring that out
[01:30:35] <Nece228> ok
[01:30:41] <Nece228> but i dont know what is css class
[01:30:42] <Nece228> so...
[01:31:06] <DannyZB> it's .class { top:25px }; for example
[01:31:24] <DannyZB> if you don't know CSS so go learn .. you can barely do anything without it
[01:32:20] <Whirl3d> Goopyo, yes. You need to cache the item and refer to the variable used to cache it...like just before the ajax, you could do var item=$(this);  and then in your callback, you can access item to refer to the original item.
[01:32:22] <james13433> how would I make this "function setLocation(url,ajax_cart_qty){" a function where ajax_cart_qty doesn't need to be passed and defaults to 1?
[01:32:42] <Goopyo> oh ok thought so
[01:33:26] <Cork> james13433: ajax_cart_qty = ajax_cart_qty === undefined ? 1 : ajax_cart_qty;
[01:33:37] <Cork> james13433: if it doens't need to support 0 it can be simpler
[01:33:49] <Cork> ajax_cart_qty = ajax_cart_qty || 1;
[01:35:28] <Whirl3d> Goopyo, try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/KD8hu/2/
[01:35:37] <james13433> Thanks Cork
[01:37:12] <Goopyo> thanks again. damn this syntaxing is going to take some getting used to
[01:38:27] <Nece228> yeah javascript syntax is horrible
[01:38:37] <Nece228> even php has better
[01:38:48] <PavelloZ> well, try CoffeeScript
[01:39:07] <Nece228> no job offers with coffeescript unfortunately
[01:39:09] <PavelloZ> (btw. most people use too much code for things they need to achieve in js)
[01:39:09] <Whirl3d> 65c02 assembly...lol
[01:39:24] <PavelloZ> look at twitter bootstrap plugins source code
[01:39:35] <PavelloZ> syntax doesnt look so bad there i guess
[01:39:53] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin can usually rewrite anything I spend weeks on in about 5 minutes with two lines of code. It's crazy
[01:40:32] <Cork> Nece228: i don't agree at all
[01:42:24] <Goopyo> Whirl3d: last thing, how do you skip the middle class term? like you know how you have siblings(".on"), how can I make it siblings("news_vote skip_middle_term .on") ?
[01:42:37] <Nece228> Cork: its probably for me the hardest to get used to it language im learning, php, python, css, html are way better than it
[01:42:42] <Goopyo> or would it just be news_vote.on?
[01:42:47] <Nece228> the syntax for me is still confusing
[01:43:14] <Whirl3d> Goopyo, not sure what you mean by middle class term
[01:43:22] <aquatix> syntax of javascript is largely the same as the one php uses
[01:43:25] <aquatix> it's all C-style
[01:43:38] <PavelloZ> Nece228: try formatting your code with whitespaces, it helps A LOT
[01:43:42] <aquatix> gheh
[01:43:51] <poppiez> when I .off('.namespace'); on an element and then .on('click.namespace', $.noop); it won't bind. if I don't unbind initially, it works. why is this?
[01:44:11] <james13433> missing ) after formal parameters
[01:44:12] <james13433> function setLocation(url, ajax_cart_qty = ajax_cart_qty || 1){ where is it missing?
[01:44:21] <Cork> poppiez: that doesn't sounds right at all
[01:44:37] <Cork> james13433: inside the function, not in the declaration
[01:44:47] <Goopyo> Whirl3d: I think (".news_vote.on") worked but I meant like my class names are "news_vote up on" "news_vote down on" etc, I wanted it to be indifferent to up/down/etc
[01:44:55] <Cork> james13433: setLocation(url, ajax_cart_qty){ ajax_cart_qty = ajax_cart_qty || 1
[01:45:22] <james13433> ah right ok, and that means I don't have to set ajax_cart_qty.
[01:45:42] <Whirl3d> just use the term that is common to all  of them...   news_vote.on   should work
[01:46:14] <Whirl3d> But do yourself a favor and pick a better classname than "on"
[01:46:47] <Whirl3d> it's used in jquery and it will get confusing...did he mean $.on() or $(".on")   for example.
[01:47:47] <poppiez> Cork: I think I've located the error. I'm using jquery.mousewheel.js that exposes "mousewheel" as an event. that is the event, that doesn't work
[01:48:02] <Cork> ah
[01:49:14] <poppiez> Cork: this is the plugin: https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel/blob/master/jquery.mousewheel.js
[01:49:18] <poppiez> can you see why it doesn't work?
[01:50:57] <Cork> not straight of the bat no
[01:51:40] <Cork> poppiez: do you get any errors when it fails?
[01:51:59] <poppiez> Cork: it doesn't fail. the event just never fires again
[01:52:10] <Cork> that is fails :)
[01:52:27] <poppiez> Cork: no, I don't :)
[01:52:38] <Cork> what i wanted to know is if it didn't fire cause code error, or cause it never binded the event again
[01:52:43] <Goopyo> Whirl3d: thanks again! bout to go pass the fuck out
[01:52:59] <Whirl3d> np. Sleep well.
[01:53:11] <poppiez> Cork: I am binding the event again but I can't say whether it actually becomes binded
[01:53:46] <Cork> poppiez: if you don't see any errors in the console, then its most likly not bound again
[01:54:03] <Cork> and i would have to disect the plugin to tell why
[01:54:26] <poppiez> weird. I'll try to look it through. I just hoped you could see what the error was right away ;-) oh, well
[01:55:11] <Cork> no, nothing in the code popes out as broken
[01:55:49] <ItsMeLenny> is there anyway to go about pulling my blog posts from blogger/blogspot and inserting into my webpage, but have my webpage determine the format
[01:56:24] <Cork> ItsMeLenny: i would proxy it over the server
[01:56:48] <ItsMeLenny> cork... i so wish i knew what that meant
[01:57:11] <Cork> ItsMeLenny: have a script that pulls the data from blogger, and caches it on the server
[01:57:22] <Cork> and then just renders it on the page
[01:57:26] <ItsMeLenny> oh
[01:57:43] <ItsMeLenny> i dont have control of ther server
[01:57:58] <ItsMeLenny> i was hoping for something more dynamic where it requests it on the users end
[01:57:59] <Cork> not sure if blogger support jsonp
[01:58:28] <ablomen> https://developers.google.com/blogger/docs/2.0/json/getting_started
[01:58:48] <Cork> or even http://code.blogger.com/2011/09/blogger-json-api-now-available.html
[01:58:50] <Cork> :)
[01:59:16] <ItsMeLenny> oh
[01:59:28] <ItsMeLenny> shouldve been googling json not jquery
[01:59:36] <ItsMeLenny> thanks, ill have a read over all of it
[02:00:22] <ItsMeLenny> i know you can get an xml feed by attatching /atom.xml on the end, anyway, ill read over it
[02:00:38] <Cork> ItsMeLenny: no you can't
[02:01:00] <Cork> ItsMeLenny: javascript can't load anything other then javascript from third party domains
[02:01:10] <Cork> so it needs to be jsonp
[02:03:57] <ItsMeLenny> i thought thats what jquery did
[02:04:21] <Cork> jquery can't do anything javascript can't
[02:04:33] <poppiez> Cork: teardown is never called when .off'ing
[02:04:51] <poppiez> Cork: it's like it doesn't respond to namedspaced events
[02:05:49] <Cork> poppiez: ya, was a bit questionable about that part of the code
[02:06:13] <Cork> poppiez: and when you put the point on it, it was obvius
[02:06:27] <Cork> poppiez: that plugin doens't support namespaces at all
[02:06:46] <Cork> it doesn't use jquerys event system internaly
[02:07:01] <Cork> so none of the jquery extensions to the system works
[02:07:14] <poppiez> Cork: meh... alright then. thx for the explanation. guess I'll have to live without namespaces then
[02:07:17] <jrockjiggz> how to insert after selected el ?
[02:07:24] <jrockjiggz> ?after
[02:07:24] <bot-t> .after(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[02:07:29] <Cork> :)
[02:08:08] <Cork> alternativly see ?.insertAfter
[02:08:09] <bot-t> .insertAfter(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements after the target. http://api.jquery.com/insertAfter/
[02:08:28] <jrockjiggz> ah cool :)
[02:21:33] <crashev> anyone knows web based javascript console to test some code on the fly ?
[02:22:06] <poppiez> crashev: jsfiddle
[02:22:09] <Nece228> heres a line in javascript: mybutt.style.top = Math.floor(Math.random()*300)+"px"
[02:22:14] <Nece228> how to convert it to jquery?
[02:23:14] <sn0lan> Nece228: why do you need to convert it to jQuery instead of just using it as JS?
[02:24:57] <Nece228> sn0lan: i already have that line: $(this).css("left","300px"); need to find some way to insert that math random thing instead of "300px"
[02:26:50] <sn0lan> var leftPos = Math.floor(Math.random()*300)
[02:26:59] <Endy> A weird problem with ajax loaded content, I've a span within a table and each span has an explicit ID. I've a function that updates the html() on the span whenever a button is clicked. The button and updating works fine, untill i load a portion of the table via ajax. I can then select the spans but the html won't update.
[02:27:05] <sn0lan> $(this).css("left", leftPos);
[02:27:14] <sn0lan> $(this).css("left", leftPos);
[02:27:19] <sn0lan> woops
[02:27:27] <sn0lan> $(this).css("left", leftPos+"px");
[02:27:30] <phil-adept> Nece228: do you know much about JS variable types? "300px" is a variable of 'type' string. You assign the equation to a variable and then use that to set the width
[02:28:12] <phil-adept> Nece228: +1 sn0lan's answer
[02:28:29] <Nece228> oh
[02:28:33] <Nece228> thanks both for help
[02:28:52] <Endy> What I mean is, I can find the spans loaded with ajax just fine, but calling html('foo') won't change what I see in the browser (even though doing window.alert(myspan.html()) shows it's been updated
[02:28:55] <Nece228> that was easy i could have figured that out, but my head doesnt work today
[02:30:09] <sn0lan> haha, I know how you feel. My heads up my arse today! damn flu
[02:30:18] <phil-adept> endy, do you have a jsfiddle to show us?
[02:30:51] <Endy> a sec
[02:30:57] <Nece228> sn0lan:, yeah but + depressed
[02:31:44] <Endy> http://jsfiddle.net/L3q3V/
[02:32:41] <Endy> Thats the js part, now this works just fine for content loaded with the page (the red "reported" text appears), but for comments loaded with ajax it does not (even though the window.alert() shows that the html is there, along with the correct id)
[02:33:34] <phil-adept> endy, I can't see you using the ajax return anywhere?
[02:33:55] <Endy> The comments are loaded with an infinite scroll script
[02:34:36] <phil-adept> ?post
[02:34:37] <bot-t> jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[02:34:54] <Endy> Like I said, that function call works just fine with the spans loaded on the page as well as the ajax loaded content
[02:35:22] <Endy> And $('#comment_' + id + '_msg') finds the ajax created elements too
[02:35:59] <Endy> But the html( ) part only updates the elements loaded with the page, not those loaded with ajax
[02:36:36] <phil-adept> endy, there's too little in this jsfiddle to get an understanding of waht you're trying to achieve and what you already have. Could you provide more so we can see what's going on?
[02:39:13] <Endy> There's nothing that would really provide any more value to the case, and it's 100s of lines of jsp code
[02:39:50] <Endy> The problem is, the red "reported" text appears on the page for <span> elements created on page load, but not for those loaded with ajax
[02:40:03] <phil-adept> Endy, from looking at your code, you're not doing much. Are you wanting to create elements using the data returned by teh ajax call?
[02:40:11] <phil-adept> you're not creating any additional elements in that code.
[02:40:33] <Endy> Like I said, the comments are loaded with another script
[02:40:44] <Endy> And that's not the problem
[02:40:52] <Endy> The problem is the red text :)
[02:40:54] <phil-adept> right, I missunderstood
[02:41:32] <Endy> I've really no idea whatsoever why that little script wouldn't work for ajax content as it finds the elements just fine
[02:41:51] <JCBK> I've been looking at this plugin (https://github.com/cmpolis/Pagify) to develop a simple single-page portfolio website. the problem is that you need to declare every page in the options of the plugin. Would there be some way to parse through a directory and add all the html files in there to the array of pages?
[02:41:55] <Endy> The text just won't show
[02:42:07] <Endy> Even though the text is there
[02:42:28] <phil-adept> have you tried removing the .hide() statement?
[02:43:02] <phil-adept> (I dunno if it's container for the <span>)
[02:44:03] <Endy> No change
[02:44:11] <ItsMeLenny> Cork, I once did this thing with youtube, and facebook, where it would pull the feed using jquery, why cant that be done with blogger
[02:44:24] <Endy> The element referenced there is an icon with a click event
[02:44:46] <Cork> ItsMeLenny: if your pulling data through jquery from a server, its jsonp
[02:44:56] <phil-adept> and how are you creating the content? Can you post that code? If you use some of jqeuries html methods, you typically need to show() at the end of the chain once you've added them to the DOM
[02:45:01] <bjensen> PavelloZ: I ended up using the $.scrollto plugin, it worked wonders :)
[02:45:07] <slide_> Is there a way to limit the ui selectable component to vertical selections in a table?
[02:45:15] <Cork> ItsMeLenny: or its something object generated from a script loaded from the other server
[02:45:40] <Cork> ItsMeLenny: cross browser, its imporible to load data from another server
[02:45:43] <phil-adept> (depdning on if you .hide() the element before inserting into the dom obv)
[02:45:46] <Endy> I jsut show appendTo to the existing table
[02:45:52] <Cork> ItsMeLenny: <script> and <img> excluded
[02:45:54] <Endy> s/show/use
[02:46:05] <ItsMeLenny> Corey, it was from rss data http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/zRSSFeed
[02:46:22] <slide_> i tried using $('#schedule').selectable({ filter: 'td:nth-child(1)' }); and increment that for each column, but only the last column really works
[02:46:24] <phil-adept> so you can see the content in the DOM using firebug?
[02:46:31] <Endy> Yeah
[02:46:35] <Cork> ItsMeLenny: goodle reader api
[02:46:42] <phil-adept> have you tried applying display:block in the firebug css panel?
[02:46:49] <Cork> ItsMeLenny: googles servers process the rss, and you load jsonp from google
[02:46:52] <Endy> nope
[02:46:54] <phil-adept> to make sure it's there and not just hidden
[02:46:55] <poppiez> I'm trying to get jquery to fire an AJAX request on `beforeunload`. while it fires, firebug marks the request with red, which make me think it doesn't go through. any thoughts?
[02:47:06] <phil-adept> try that, if you're seeing it in the markup, it may just be hidden
[02:47:11] <Endy> will do
[02:47:15] <ItsMeLenny> ohhhhh right
[02:47:18] <ItsMeLenny> thanks
[02:47:26] <beeviz> uuuhm
[02:47:34] <beeviz> is it possible that jquery eats <map> elements?
[02:47:55] <phil-adept> eats? lol
[02:48:02] <beeviz> yep. yum yum yum
[02:48:49] <phil-adept> poppiez, are you using firebug?
[02:49:00] <poppiez> phil-adept: yes
[02:49:05] <beeviz> i have
[02:49:13] <beeviz> $('#mapcontainer').html('<map id="navimap" name="navimap"></map><h1>foo</h1>');
[02:49:19] <beeviz> and my html output is:
[02:49:22] <beeviz> <h1>foo</h1>
[02:49:30] <phil-adept> poppiez, if so you can use the 'persist' feature. It will keep all requests in the panel and won't clear on pageunload
[02:49:32] <beeviz> where did my map go?!
[02:50:06] <poppiez> phil-adept: neato. where is it located?
[02:50:18] <phil-adept> beeviz: do you want to insert <h1>foo</h1> after the <map> ?
[02:50:21] <phil-adept> ?html
[02:50:21] <bot-t> .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[02:51:00] <phil-adept> .html() replaces the content. You may need ?insertAfter
[02:51:24] <phil-adept> ?insertAfter
[02:51:25] <bot-t> .insertAfter(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements after the target. http://api.jquery.com/insertAfter/

[02:51:48] <phil-adept> poppiez, do you use the net panel?
[02:51:52] <poppiez> phil-adept: yeah
[02:52:39] <phil-adept> okies, where you select the net panel there's a toolbar below with persist. Click it
[02:53:04] <phil-adept> should show "clear", "persist", "all", "html" etc etc
[02:53:25] <Cork> beeviz: http://jsfiddle.net/GHFfw/1/
[02:53:29] <phil-adept> you may need to use the console tab though, but same procedure
[02:54:26] <poppiez> phil-adept: perfect :) thx
[02:56:15] <beeviz> hmm strange
[03:00:01] <demetan> I try to do a post with jquery but there is no data in $_POST (response)
[03:00:03] <Endy> phil-adept: figured it out, there was nothing wrong with the code, just duplicate IDs in the content :)
[03:00:28] <Endy> Basically wrong spans were updated
[03:02:07] <phil-adept> endy: ah great, at least you figured it out
[03:12:49] <gob> what's better?

[04:02:43] <NodeX> ^^
[04:02:49] <Cork> .base > .br and .base > .ui-footer
[04:03:04] <Cork> so if you hide .base the other ones are hidden; period

[04:35:48] <dgx> Hey all. Using jCarousel how can I make it move an image at a item, instead of all new items - for example if I have 5 items, 3 of them are visible,  2 invisible, how can I make when I click next, hide 1st visible and make 4th item(that is invisible) - visible?

[05:09:25] <boblet> hey all, Iâ€™m doing jQueryUI drag-n-drop, and want to destroy droppable when the drag ends. $( myDroppable ).droppable( 'destroy' ); works fine in drop and stop functions, but doesnâ€™t seem to apply to elements that revert (using revert: invalid)
[05:09:29] <ec8or_> xec_: cheers :)
[05:09:38] <raj> xec_, put this way, why might I NOT want the ARIA one?
[05:10:10] <boblet> anyone know how to destroy droppable() when the drop isnâ€™t successful?
[05:10:18] <xec_> raj: maybe you don't need the added functionality
[05:11:17] <jeffsmykil> Could some one educmacate me on how to write this http://pastebin.com/b9uMThSk more concisely maybe using toggle?

[05:42:31] <demetan> how to output JSON variables in jquery ?
[05:42:49] <Cork> demetan: output?
[05:42:52] <Cork> output where?
[05:43:15] <demetan> a jason  array in a div
[05:43:19] <demetan> sorry
[05:43:28] <raulirikama> Quick question if anybody has used jQuery Form Plugin. Has any done Basic HTML auth with it? How to do that?
[05:43:34] <demetan> a json array in a div for example ?
[05:43:49] <Cork> ok, and by json you mean a json like object?
[05:43:53] <Cork> not a string
[05:43:56] <demetan> yes
[05:44:14] <Cork> JSON.stringify
[05:44:32] <demetan> thank s I try it
[05:44:35] <Cork> ?eval JSON.stringify({ key:['val']})
[05:44:40] <bot-t> Cork: "{\"key\":[\"val\"]}"
[05:45:11] <Cork> demetan: side comment, thats javascript native, not jquery
[05:45:36] <Cork> and its not supported in old ie browsers
[05:45:39] <demetan> ok
[05:46:51] <demetan> there is an equivalent of eval in jquery ?
[05:47:32] <Cork> jquery is written in javascript, so for things like that you should just look for what javascript offers
[05:47:37] <Cork> and yes eval exists in javascript
[05:47:52] <Cork> (though its considerd a sin to use it excessivly)
[05:48:05] <Cork> or actually almost ever
[05:48:37] <Cork> demetan: or if you mean the live running of code, just look for the browsers javascript console
[05:48:43] <Cork> all modern browsers has one
[05:49:14] <demetan> yes I have the values
[05:54:00] <demetan> Cork: thank s for the support alert(data['long']+data['lat']); and that's all
[06:02:12] <Onyx47> Hi, can anyone help me figure out why .index() returns -1 here? http://jsfiddle.net/Kzqad/
[06:02:51] <raj> Cork, say you want to filter pictures (from a list of pictures in the DOM) by the number of views. How should I present that to the user?
[06:03:02] <raj> a selection box seems tedious
[06:03:07] <raj> and I'm not sure a slider is appropriate
[06:03:13] <raj> (a range slider)
[06:03:32] <ajpiano> Onyx47: you can't pass a jquery object as an argument to .index
[06:03:33] <raj> is there a good UX way of presenting this option to the user?
[06:03:42] <ajpiano> Onyx47: furthermore, calling .index() with no args will yield the index relative to its siblings
[06:03:44] <ajpiano> so you can just use that
[06:03:46] <Cork> raj: filter on views?
[06:04:03] <Cork> raj: you mean to let them filter what images to show?
[06:04:12] <raj> there are thumbnails of pictures sitting in the dom. I have data attached to them containing the number of views
[06:04:15] <raj> exactly
[06:04:41] <Cork> raj: http://jqueryui.com/demos/selectable/
[06:04:49] <Onyx47> ajpiano, tried both things - extracting the DOM element with .get also returns -1, no arguments always returns 0
[06:05:44] <ajpiano> Onyx47: what are you trying to do, get the number column that was clicked?
[06:05:50] <Onyx47> ajpiano, yes
[06:06:39] <ajpiano> Onyx47: seems to work fine for me http://jsfiddle.net/Kzqad/1/
[06:08:51] <Onyx47> ajpiano, oooh, ok, didn't know you could just use .index like that, thanks. also, I keep forgetting about the .closest() method so thanks for that too
[06:09:08] <ajpiano> ...that's what i meant by using it with no arguments to get its index amongst its siblings :)
[06:09:10] <ajpiano> no prob
[06:09:50] <jrockjiggz> Hi all, I have  if( func() ){ //do something } but its not doing that..    in that function i am: return true;  when i console.log(func()); console says 'return true'.. am i going crazy?
[06:10:03] <Onyx47> yeah, I thougt I HAVE to reference the tr, figured it will start from DOM root otherwise, misread the docs I guess
[06:10:25] <Cork> jrockjiggz: it actually says 'return true' ??
[06:10:36] <Cork> or just >> true
[06:11:05] <jrockjiggz> actia;;y
[06:11:11] <jrockjiggz> actually, it returns undefined
[06:11:21] <Cork> :)
[06:11:33] <jrockjiggz> i still don't understand =/
[06:11:46] <Cork> jrockjiggz: pb the code in the function if you want help
[06:12:12] <jrockjiggz> ok
[06:12:53] <raj> Cork, only thing is, the area is about the height and width of my thumb's tip to knuckle (x^2)
[06:13:22] <Cork> raj: you can drag select with that
[06:13:32] <Cork> thats why i showed it as an alternative
[06:14:52] <raj> in the selectable example, it'll only fit 3 of their boxes
[06:15:06] <raj> i imagine, you're saying that each box would be a range
[06:15:27] <Cork> raj: no
[06:15:34] <Cork> only look at the functionality
[06:15:40] <Cork> the design is up to your css
[06:15:52] <Cork> you can have a list or a grid its up to you
[06:16:03] <shwaiil> Q: I've got one element with overflow hidden, with a nested element that is bottom -own_height. So its not visible. On mouseover I want to slide it in and mouseout slide out. I'm doing http://pastie.org/private/q2m7vhueru8lfnojzeqhka but I think there must be a better way of doing it. Any tips ? Thanks
[06:16:48] <raj> i understand, but how many list items (containing ranges) can I fit in (thumb-tip<->thumb-knuckle)^2 ?
[06:17:26] <jrockjiggz> Cork: i replicated my problem.. you'll see the if doesn't get the function's return true http://jsfiddle.net/s5GAN/
[06:17:42] <Cork> raj: now i'm not following you at all
[06:18:27] <Cork> jrockjiggz: your returning true in the success callback in the async ajax call
[06:18:40] <Cork> it doesn't get to the returnTrue at all
[06:18:49] <jrockjiggz> ohh
[06:18:59] <jrockjiggz> hmm. how could a escape that?
[06:19:54] <Cork> jrockjiggz: http://jsfiddle.net/s5GAN/1/
[06:19:56] <raj> I mean, I have a very small area to work with...about an inch by an inch...and in there you're suggesting to list ranges (such as 0-500, 501-1000, 1001-2000, 2001-10000, etc). And then make those selectable?
[06:20:02] <Cork> blah...
[06:20:03] <Xotix> Can someone explain me very rough what jquery widget is about?
[06:20:16] <Cork> jrockjiggz: the correct one http://jsfiddle.net/s5GAN/2/
[06:20:25] <raj> Xotix, what widget?
[06:20:43] <Xotix> raj jQuery.widget
[06:20:56] <jrockjiggz> Cork: ty
[06:21:03] <Cork> raj: in that range you don't really have the space to let anyone select multible thumbnails
[06:21:18] <raj> Xotix, it's to create a jquery plugin
[06:21:23] <Cork> raj: what i meant was you can use that to let the user visibly select the thumbnail shown
[06:21:49] <Cork> as in opacity: .5; for selected thumbnails, for example
[06:22:38] <Xotix> raj but it's more used by jQuery in the background then directly by me?
[06:22:41] <raj> Cork, the thumbnails are in a huge div, with ample space. I am trying to filter down the amount of thumbnails by allowing the user to choose only those that have a certain number of views
[06:22:50] <raj> Xotix, jquery doesn't really use it
[06:22:55] <raj> but plugins for jquery might
[06:23:04] <raj> you can use it as well, if you'd like to create your own plugin
[06:23:10] <Cork> raj: ok, what do you mean with number of views?
[06:23:11] <raj> but ordinarily you don't need to worry about it
[06:23:23] <Xotix> raj when yould i have to worry about it?
[06:23:28] <Cork> i think thats where your losing me
[06:23:31] <Xotix> *w
[06:23:43] <raj> Cork, if someone clicks on a thumbnail, it goes full screen. by clicking on it, it's "view counter" is incremented by 1
[06:24:07] <Cork> raj: so you want to sort them based on the popularity?
[06:24:07] <raj> so if it has 1000 views...it's because it was clicked on 1000 times
[06:24:29] <raj> nope, not sort. but hide those that are Less than the number of views specified by the user
[06:24:47] <raj> or more than a certain number of views
[06:25:18] <raj> Xotix, when you're writing custom jquery plugins that you plan on sharing with the world
[06:25:20] <Cork> Xotix: jquery ui widget is the base object all jquery ui objects are derived from, it gives the ui the general features
[06:25:59] <Cork> raj: so a slider with two handels?
[06:26:07] <raj> err, hope I didn't mislead him
[06:26:50] <raj> Cork, ok, I guess that makes the most sense
[06:26:51] <raj> thanks
[06:27:00] <Cork> good luck
[06:27:05] <raj> thanks :)
[06:27:17] <Xotix> Cork hmm ok.
[06:27:20] <Xotix> thanks
[06:27:33] <Cork> Xotix: you've heard of the widgetfactory?
[06:28:01] <Cork> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138135/Widget%20factory
[06:28:07] <Cork> that should get you going on what widget is
[06:28:40] <Xotix> Yes, i read a little bit about it. thanks

[06:30:52] <Flo0815> hi guys, how do i disabled/enable a <input> ?
[06:31:09] <Cork> $('input').attr('disabled', 'disabled')
[06:31:15] <Cork> $('input').removeAttr('disabled')
[06:31:27] <raj> ahh, cool
[06:31:44] <Flo0815> Cork: so, .attr('disabled', '') to enable doesn't work?
[06:31:51] <Cork> nope
[06:31:54] <Flo0815> k thx
[06:31:56] <Cork> you need removeAttr
[06:32:48] <Flo0815> and to disable .attr('disabled', 'disabled'); ?
[06:32:53] <Cork> yes
[06:33:10] <Cork> , 'disabled') isn't strictly needed
[06:33:25] <Cork> as all the standard demands is the pressense of the attribute
[06:33:46] <Cork> but its what was sat for xhtml back in the days, and i've stuck with it :)
[06:34:09] <Cork> feels better then attr('disabled', '') to disable
[06:36:12] <warrenparsons> Flo0815: Cork: Disabled is a property, not an attribute. You should be using $('input').prop('disabled', true)

[06:55:31] <shwaiil> *mouseenter / leave seemes to solve http://jsfiddle.net/PH6fD/28/
[06:55:50] <abondis> but the table is not refreshed
[06:55:51] <shwaiil> Cork: .stop didnt worked for this case :T thanks for looking, it's allways a nice tip
[06:55:54] <Cork> yes over out reacts on child elements
[06:56:01] <shwaiil> I see
[06:56:03] <abondis> using "bServerSide"
[06:56:10] <Cork> enter leave is almost always the correct option
[06:59:27] <krizoek> i simply cant seem to get this working; it does run, but just not with the x variable: var auto_refresh=setInterval(function() {var x = $(\'#bk\').val(); $(\'#css\').load(\'populate_select_test.php?b=6&bk=\'+x);}, 1000);
[06:59:47] <PavelloZ> sorry got disconnected, Cork please elaborate on the .val() over .value topic im just curious if it is critical to use .val() over .value if possible
[07:00:11] <quicksilver> it's certainly important to understand the difference.
[07:00:20] <quicksilver> .value is a property of a DOM object
[07:00:22] <krizoek> does javascript require spaces ?
[07:00:25] <quicksilver> .val() is a method on a jQuery object
[07:01:07] <Cork> PavelloZ: document.getElementById('somethingThatSometimesExist').value will crash if the element is missing
[07:01:11] <PavelloZ> mhm, so it matters when trying to obtain an optional value, since it wont have an undefined
[07:01:20] <Cork> PavelloZ: $('#somethingThatSometimesExist').val() works fine
[07:01:22] <PavelloZ> ouh, that too, right
[07:01:34] <PavelloZ> ok, that bought me, thanks :)
[07:02:08] <Cork> the unfailability of jquery is one of its strongest points and what made me love it when i start using it
[07:02:12] <PavelloZ> anyway it is a good idea to not manipulate objects that arent in the dom :)
[07:02:34] <PavelloZ> (dom objects that doesnt exist i ment)
[07:02:51] <Cork> PavelloZ: sure, but it might be that its suppose to be added, but something failed
[07:02:53] <Cork> for example
[07:03:04] <PavelloZ> mhm
[07:03:16] <Cork> if the code doesn't crash, you can make it auto recover
[07:03:27] <krizoek> when i wish to have the value of the x variable into the string; isnt it correct doing 'string'+x ?
[07:03:40] <Cork> yes
[07:03:51] <krizoek> ok
[07:04:02] <Cork> ?eval var x = 160; 'string'+x
[07:04:02] <bot-t> Cork: "string160"
[07:04:45] <krizoek> then the var x = $(\'#bk\').val(); must be whats not working in this case
[07:04:56] <krizoek> i also tried with .value;
[07:05:08] <PavelloZ> try not to escape the selector
[07:06:23] <krizoek> it didnt work either
[07:08:54] <krizoek> ahh, my bad. i forgot to have the right name for the variable in php
[07:12:05] <PavelloZ> krizoek: http://jsfiddle.net/pavelloz/DDZCq/5/
[07:12:24] <PavelloZ> damn i shouldnt minimize putty during creating demo :>
[07:24:43] <dabdine_> i'm trying to replace some code that was doing a document.body.appendChild(foo) with $('body').append(foo) in jquery, but i'm finding that it's garbling the page content
[07:24:47] <dabdine_> anything i'm missing?
[07:24:55] <shwaiil> Q: Is mousewheel available by default on jQuery ? Or only trough plugin ? Thanks for looking
[07:25:18] <natte|wrk> shwaiil: I remember jquery.mousewheel plugin from somewhere
[07:25:53] <shwaiil> natte|wrk: yeh, it's available in form of plugin. bUt i'm first making sure there's a "native jquery" way of doing this without use of plugins
[07:25:53] <shwaiil> but I guess nt
[07:26:10] <THC4k> I'm doing `$.when(load_player_data(), load_show_data()).done(combine_data).done(render_page)` where the `load_*` methods `return $.getJSON(url, function(data,status,xhr) { return data })`. Still my `combine_data` function receives `[data,status,xhr]`arrays, not just `data`. What am I doing wrong?
[07:28:57] <steveccc> can anyone tell me whats wrong with http://pastebin.com/FuqK7uRG
[07:29:55] <alexr2> steveccc, nothing.
[07:30:14] <alexr2> The code itself is fine, though it may not be doing what you want it to do.
[07:30:19] <alexr2> What are you trying to get it to do?
[07:30:30] <steveccc> I am getting error missing } in xml expression
[07:30:55] <alexr2> And its saying that the error is coming from those lines of code?
[07:32:46] <Nece228> hello
[07:32:47] <Nece228> http://jsfiddle.net/C2czs/
[07:32:48] <steveccc> alex2: it isnt no but its only erroring when i add that code - its going into drupal - wonder if I am meant to add jquery functions in a different way
[07:33:07] <Nece228> how to make that you know that button will only be moved after short period of time
[07:33:11] <Nece228> like 0.1 sec
[07:33:27] <Nece228> so it will be catchy game
[07:33:29] <moltar_net> Hi! I am trying to replace confirm() with bootbox solution (http://bootboxjs.com/). The problem is that when you click link, or button, you need to prevent the original event from firing to give user time to decide OK/Cancel. But how do I continue with the original event after it was OKeyed? Thanks!
[07:33:43] <ajpiano> Nece228: use a timeout ?
[07:33:51] <Nece228> yeah i need timeout
[07:33:55] <Nece228> not sure how to implement
[07:34:04] <Nece228> by saying not sure i meant lazy
[07:34:19] <alexr2> Hmm... not really sure.  I don't really know how drupal affects jquery and how it's used.  Sorry
[07:34:39] <alexr2> We don't help the lazy :-P
[07:34:46] <ajpiano> what he said.
[07:34:55] <ajpiano> if you haven't tried at least once no one really cares

[07:40:47] <Sebah> Hi. I'm trying to update the value="" of an input field using jquery. I tried both ways val('...') and attr('value','...'). When I try console.log($('input').val()) it's returning the right value, but the HTML stays the same, no change. I need the html to update too. Any ideas on why is it doing this?
[07:41:26] <alexr2> Sebah, the DOM isn't updated, but if you submit your form, the correct value will be sent.
[07:41:55] <alexr2> Why do you need the actual html updated?
[07:41:58] <quicksilver> I think that depends what you mean by "the DOM isn't updated"
[07:42:14] <quicksilver> the DOM (Document Object Model) stored by the browser certainly is updated.
[07:42:21] <alexr2> By that I mean inspecting an element, you won't see a difference
[07:42:24] <quicksilver> the "original HTML source" isn't
[07:42:48] <Nece228> whats wrong with this line?
[07:42:50] <Nece228> $(this).idle(100).animate({top: random_top, left: random_left}, 200);
[07:42:54] <Sebah> alexr2: that's the thing. Eventhough it's showing the right value if I try console.log, when the form is submitted the value isn't being sent ( it's blank, or previous hardcoded value )
[07:43:23] <alexr2> Sebah, do you have name="input1" or something of that sort or just id="input1"
[07:43:31] <quicksilver> Sebah: your selector probably isn't selecting the element you think it's selecting.
[07:43:43] <PavelloZ> Sebah: this is strange, i just tested it on my page and it is working like a charm
[07:43:52] <gnarf> quicksilver: if we are trying to be discreetly literal - "The attributes of the HTMLElement are not updated"
[07:44:03] <quicksilver> gnarf: :)
[07:44:45] <gnarf> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1388893/jquery-html-in-firefox-uses-innerhtml-ignores-dom-changes
[07:45:20] <Sebah> alexr2 & quicksilver: yes it is. I tried accesing the selector in different ways $(input[name="something"]), $('#ID'), $('input#id), etc. ( and it's a crossbrowser thing ff, chrome, ie )
[07:45:41] <alexr2> Sebah, http://jsfiddle.net
[07:45:42] <PavelloZ> http://jsfiddle.net/pavelloz/GKEqK/1/
[07:45:48] <Sebah> PavelloZ: i'm aware it works like a charm, it works for me on other pages, but not on this one. there are no errors,  no warnings, no nothing
[07:47:12] <quicksilver> Sebah: well if you know it works on other pages, and you know it doesn't work on this one, then you need to understand what is different between the other pages and this one.
[07:47:13] <gnarf> is anyone here coming to the bowling thing in DC area friday? http://bowling4jquery.eventbrite.com/
[07:47:29] <quicksilver> Sebah: all we can tell you is that it definitely works, and you must have some kind of bug...
[07:47:33] <gnarf> or the jQuery Meetup tomorrow? http://www.meetup.com/DC-jQuery-Users-Group/
[07:48:05] <Sebah> quicksilver: I'm aware that there might ( probably ) be someting funky with that page, but I was just asking hoping there's a known bug :P
[07:49:32] <gehsekky> gnarf: are you in dc?
[07:49:37] <gehsekky> thing is like $40 :(
[07:49:50] <gehsekky> also, i wonder why the heck it's out in leesburg
[07:50:21] <gnarf> gehsekky: I'm @ O'Hare airport right now, headed to Dulles
[07:50:24] <Sebah> alexr2: here it is http://jsfiddle.net/r6vh8/6/ ( just that bit of that page  )
[07:50:39] <gehsekky> oh cool
[07:50:47] <gehsekky> are you flying in just for this meetup?
[07:51:26] <kanzie> I just made a fiddle with only a $.ajax()-call that loads a json-dataset every second. In the success-handler I just set result to nullâ€¦ still it starts with 60mb in chrome and slowly grows, it is now 90MB after 1 hour. Is this a problem of retained memory or does Chrome have a slow GC?
[07:51:27] <gnarf> gehsekky: well a lot of the jQuery core team is meeting up - the "meetup" and the "bowling" are just on our schedule ;)
[07:53:34] <gehsekky> gnarf: cool man. didn't realize you were part of the core team
[07:53:59] <gehsekky> maybe i'll swing out to that event
[07:54:34] <gehsekky> oh wait
[07:54:36] <gehsekky> sold out already
[08:02:53] <auska> hi! I have this source, that works properly for the CVE link, but not for the Security focus one, does anyone knows why? http://pastebin.com/Y2KtrW2f
[08:03:27] <rook2pawn> how do you replace a $(el).click(fn) function? i tried $(el).click(fn2) but that mereely added fn2 to the list of fn's that $(el).click was going to do.
[08:03:52] <kanzie> Is growing memory usage when using ajax() a know problem or is it in fact not a problem at all?
[08:03:56] <johnkpaul> auska: because those two elements have the same id
[08:04:02] <gehsekky> rook2pawn: .unbind('click') or .off('click') ?
[08:04:03] <johnkpaul> you can only have one element in the dom for each id
[08:04:09] <quicksilver> kanzie: there have been loads of issues like this in the past
[08:04:20] <quicksilver> kanzie: some have been browser bugs and some jquery bugs
[08:04:27] <rook2pawn> gehsekky: there isn't fine grained control of shifting off the list of fn's on .click?
[08:04:27] <quicksilver> kanzie: I'm afraid I don't know what the current status is.
[08:04:40] <rook2pawn> or sshift/unshift/pop/push?
[08:04:40] <quicksilver> kanzie: just google for "jquery ajax memory leak" to get a sample
[08:04:51] <quicksilver> ?unbind @ rook2pawn
[08:04:52] <bot-t> rook2pawn, .unbind([eventType], [handler]): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[08:05:16] <kanzie> quicksilver: yeah I've had this problem for months but last time I asked about it I was told to not use XML but switch to json in my servers response. It took a bit of effort and now when its finally done I still see the same leak so Im quite bummed out!
[08:05:26] <rook2pawn> oh so if you .click(fn1) .click(fn2) .unbind('click') does this remove fn2?
[08:05:40] <demetan> how I can a global variable created in jquery, and after in javascript or readble in html ?
[08:05:59] <Xotix> why is this not working? $(settings.inputId) settings is an obj defining inputId
[08:06:05] <quicksilver> rook2pawn: read the docs. That will remove all of them but you can specify which if you wish.
[08:06:37] <quicksilver> Xotix: '#'+
[08:06:44] <auska> johnkpaul, but if I want 2 elements do the same, i need the same source 2 times then?
[08:06:53] <johnkpaul> no, add a class
[08:06:55] <johnkpaul> and select by the class
[08:06:56] <johnkpaul> auska:
[08:07:02] <Xotix> quicksilver: ha..of course
[08:07:07] <Xotix> thanks
[08:07:25] <johnkpaul> Xotix: I've actually thought about figuring out if there was a way to add a jshint plugin
[08:07:27] <johnkpaul> to stop taht error
[08:07:31] <johnkpaul> because I ued to do it all the time
[08:07:37] <johnkpaul> because I came from prototype's $
[08:08:49] <gnarf> rook2pawn: yes it will
[08:09:02] <gnarf> rook2pawn: are you trying to make a "toggling" click?
[08:09:04] <gnarf> see ?toggle
[08:09:05] <bot-t> .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[08:09:15] <gnarf> although I think that goes to the wrong place
[08:09:17] <gnarf> ?toggle event
[08:09:19] <bot-t> gnarf, .toggle() - Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[08:09:25] <gnarf> that one is the right "toggle"
[08:09:47] <gnarf> rook2pawn: To be honest, "unbind"ing events is - in general - something to avoid
[08:10:05] <gnarf> It usually only causes you more headaches
[08:11:50] <auska> johnkpaul, if I add a class to select it, then it works but always detect the first href, not the second one... (I mean, when I do the 'var url = ...')
[08:12:06] <gnarf> ?each @auska
[08:12:06] <bot-t> auska, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[08:12:18] <rook2pawn> gnarf: just wondering if this would fly http://pastie.org/3768605
[08:13:04] <auska> gnarf, the problem is that if I use .each() how can I detect which one produced the event?
[08:13:18] <gnarf> it would have fn1 & fn2 bound until the animation ended then fn1 & fn3
[08:13:27] <johnkpaul> auska: $(this)
[08:13:29] <gnarf> auska: event.target ?
[08:13:33] <gnarf> auska: or "this"
[08:13:34] <johnkpaul> or event.target
[08:13:37] <gnarf> lol
[08:13:37] <johnkpaul> :)
[08:14:41] <auska> thanks johnkpaul , gnarf  ;)
[08:20:23] <shwaiil> Q: Let's say I have element ".btn", I want to bind to it a click event. I want to do something, when the element is being pressed, while is being pressed. What's the way to do it ? Thanks
[08:20:26] <kanzie> is there anything I can do to prevent the leaking memory in ajax()-method?
[08:22:39] <gnarf> shwaiil: mousedown / mouseup events
[08:22:46] <gnarf> shwaiil: instead of "click"
[08:23:30] <gnarf> kanzie: what version of jQuery?
[08:23:33] <quicksilver> kanzie: it seems that nobody awake knows any details. A standard hack is to use javascript to force a full page reload every (say) N hours or so.
[08:23:37] <shwaiil> gnarf: thanks for looking, I'll try it :) let's say $(el).mousedown(function(){ console.log('hello'); }); Would give me lot's of "Hello" strings ?
[08:23:49] <kanzie> Ive seen the problem in all versions >1.4.4, currently running 1.7.2
[08:24:07] <quicksilver> kanzie: obviously you then need a way to persist complete page state, but then well designed web apps have that already? :-)
[08:24:24] <kanzie> quicksilver: I do that, but its ugly. As a matter of fact a reload does not clear the memory so I have a scheduled job that kills chrome and loads it back up again.
[08:24:50] <quicksilver> hmm. if page reload doesn't clear the memory that makes me think it's a chrome bug.
[08:25:35] <gnarf> kanzie: memory bloating seems a little inevitable, but things like not keeping references to your jqXHR's will probably help a lot, also try to avoid circular references to them - where the jqXHR will be in scope of itself somewhere it makes it near impossible to garbage collect
[08:27:01] <shwaiil> gnarf: It's only triggered once, so I get only output console.log('hello'); maybe I should use setInterval for this ?!
[08:27:09] <kanzie> gnarf: I think I have it as clear as I can. Im using module-pattern and inside of an object I have http://jsfiddle.net/HtKeV/
[08:27:26] <kanzie> this is the ajax-call as bare as it can be. Im not even doing anything with the resultsâ€¦still it creeps
[08:27:35] <gnarf> kanzie: avoid using the success: complete: stuff
[08:27:41] <shwaiil> the idea is to have something like "mouseover" and do some action in the time the mouse is over. In my specific case, instead, mouse click or mouse pressed. because in ipad there's no mouseover for example
[08:28:20] <gnarf> kanzie: at least with inline anon functions
[08:28:24] <kanzie> gnarf: but does that not defeat half the point of using $.ajax(), the success-handler is a great tool and the complete-handler is important for me to set a flag
[08:28:31] <gnarf> kanzie:  see ?done
[08:28:31] <bot-t> kanzie, deferred.done(doneCallbacks, [doneCallbacks]): Add handlers to be called when the Deferred object is resolved. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[08:28:35] <gnarf> and see ?always
[08:28:35] <bot-t> deferred.always(alwaysCallbacks, [alwaysCallbacks]): [New in v1.6] Add handlers to be called when the Deferred object is either resolved or rejected. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.always/
[08:28:46] <gnarf> $.ajax().done( fn )
[08:28:56] <gnarf> ==== $.ajax({ success: fn })
[08:29:27] <gnarf> kanzie: but try putting all the callback function definitions in a different scope from the actual ajax call
[08:29:30] <kanzie> but I have several different ajax()-calls that does different things in their success-handlers. So setting a global success-handler won't work for me
[08:29:41] <gnarf> kanzie: its not global
[08:29:42] <Sebah> quicksilver: can you have a look at my issue please http://jsfiddle.net/r6vh8/6/ ? alexr2 it's idleing
[08:29:46] <gnarf> you can still use whatever handlers you want
[08:29:54] <gnarf> kanzie: just define them as named functions
[08:29:56] <kanzie> so the success-handler should call a function that does the success-stuff?
[08:30:06] <gnarf> function receivedABCData( data ) {}....
[08:30:09] <gnarf> or something like that
[08:30:09] <devOlsen_> yes it should
[08:30:12] <devOlsen_> its a callback
[08:30:36] <gnarf> because then the function isn't defined in the same scope as the jqXHR is being used, and you might have better luck with getting a garbage collector to pick up the memory
[08:30:41] <gnarf> anyway
[08:30:42] <gnarf> ?glwt
[08:30:43] <bot-t> http://goodluckwiththatdude.com
[08:30:49] <gnarf> I gotta get on a plane soon
[08:31:36] <kanzie> like so: http://jsfiddle.net/HtKeV/1/
[08:32:07] <quicksilver> gnarf's advice doesn't match with my understanding of how the javascript GCs work, but I'll be interested to hear if following his advice changes things.
[08:35:53] <danzik17> kanzie: you might want to structure it more like http://jsfiddle.net/HtKeV/2/ - it makes function doing the ajax call a bit more re-usable since it doesn't always have to define the same success handler
[08:37:33] <kanzie> how do I catch the error()-handler in that example?
[08:38:01] <ajpiano> attach a .fail() handler as well...
[08:40:52] <kanzie> ajpiano: so getMainValues().done(function() {}).fail(function() {}); ?
[08:40:57] <ajpiano> yep
[08:41:23] <kanzie> done == complete? What is the equivalent of success then?
[08:41:30] <ajpiano> no, done === success
[08:41:33] <ajpiano> fail === error
[08:41:37] <ajpiano> always === complete
[08:41:55] <kanzie> ajpiano: ah, okâ€¦ sweet! Ill try thatâ€¦ so I should avoid ajax() own handlers in general?
[08:41:57] <ajpiano> there's also .then( successFn, failFn)
[08:42:07] <ajpiano> i don't know
[08:43:19] <Xploderman90> Gnagno return at work NOW!
[08:43:27] <Xploderman90> You don't have to waste time in chat.
[08:44:14] <Xploderman90> Don't you bother answering, just work.
[08:45:28] <kanzie> ajpiano: and I pass result from ajax() to done() as a param?
[08:45:43] <ajpiano> what? no
[08:45:50] <ajpiano> .done receives the same arguments as success
[08:45:56] <kanzie> getMainValues().done(function(result) { alert(result) });
[08:46:02] <kanzie> yeah, that's what I meant...
[08:46:10] <kanzie> just not very clear :-)
[08:46:13] <ajpiano> heh
[08:46:16] <ajpiano> kanzie: all i can say is
[08:46:28] <ajpiano> i look forward to still debugging this memory leak together with you and my children in the far distant future
[08:46:39] <ajpiano> :p
[08:47:21] <kanzie> ajpiano: hahaha, thanks for getting my hopes up! :-) Yeah, it's been around a while. I re-wrote the backend to get away from XML as no one wanted to touch my problem as long as I didn't get json in return. Now with json the leak is still there, albeit not as bad.
[08:48:35] <gianiaz> Hi, I want to open a dialog in jquery-mobile, but I want to create it dinymically (I have to show error messages), any hint?
[08:54:04] <foo> Anyone used jQuery Backstretch ? I'm having some issues with it on the iPad, looking for an alternative. *googles
[08:54:59] <Grafica> Does anyone have experience with jplayer?
[08:56:54] <kanzie> ajpiano: still leaking like a sieveâ€¦ :-( So yeah, I guess Ill get to know your children
[08:57:11] <ajpiano> they aren't born yet
[08:57:17] <ajpiano> or even a realistic possibility right now
[08:57:42] <kanzie> and the leak doesn't seem to go anywhere anytime soon so its ok :-)
[08:58:05] <kanzie> I just don't get it, how could anything be retained, its not doing anything. Its not even holding on the 325b of data that it is loading

[09:11:59] <antgel> hi all, i'm looking to add a couple of checkboxes to a dialog and i was hoping that jquery ui could provide some nice eye-candy checkboxes.  but all i found so far was http://jqueryui.com/demos/button (checkbox example), which isn't a checkbox at all - it's a toggle button.  any clues for something that might fit the bill?
[09:14:09] <Sebah> antgel not using jquery ui. but you can try http://www.dfc-e.com/metiers/multimedia/opensource/jqtransform/
[09:15:09] <demetan> please how I can set global variables in jquery to javascript ou html ?
[09:17:50] <alexr2> window[varname] = "abc"
[09:18:19] <alexr2> Honestly, I don't quite understand your question though :-P
[09:18:46] <antgel> Sebah: i'll take a look, thanks
[09:19:56] <fatninja> can you have static variables ? Some form of variable that can be modified at any time, and the changes remain while the user is on the page.
[09:20:24] <quicksilver> yes, fatninja, javascript variables behave like that.
[09:20:47] <fatninja> ok, I never tried it, I wanted a starting point first
[09:21:37] <fatninja> works
[09:25:41] <rabbi1> I nave imported jquery 1.7.2.min.js but my firebug says "datepicker is not a function " whats the problem ?
[09:25:50] <alexr2> datepicker isn't built in to jquery
[09:25:56] <alexr2> it's a jquery-ui plugin
[09:26:37] <alexr2> does bot-t have a ?lmgtfy function?
[09:26:41] <alexr2> :-P
[09:26:42] <majd> Hey #jquery - can someone tell me why this code completely crashes the browser? http://dpaste.com/730194/
[09:26:51] <alexr2> ?lmgtfy jquery datepicker
[09:26:51] <bot-t> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+datepicker
[09:26:53] <alexr2> nice
[09:27:00] <rabbi1> alexr2: i have even included the custom jquery ui
[09:27:52] <rabbi1> ok, may be some dependencies, brb
[09:28:00] <alexr2> Are you including the jquery ui (with the datepicker plugin) before you try to call datepicker?
[09:28:40] <majd> the #src_options tag mentioned has a bunch of labels for radio button input
[09:28:50] <rabbi1> alexr2: i have got Core, Widget, Mouse, Position (UI Core) and DatePicker (Widget) that's it. anything else i am missing ?
[09:29:26] <alexr2> ?each @majd
[09:29:26] <bot-t> majd, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[09:29:38] <rabbi1> where i need only Core for datePicker
[09:30:17] <alexr2> Need to use that, a regular for loop will iterate over each character i believe
[09:30:45] <majd> bot-t: OOOH! that will be very useful
[09:34:48] <rabbi1> datepicker is not a function
[09:35:04] <alexr2> rabbi1, can you show some page code?
[09:35:07] <alexr2> http://jsfiddle.net
[09:35:55] <rabbi1> alexr2: What can i show, it's same basic what is in jquery site, anyway 2 secs
[09:36:19] <alexr2> Just try to rebuild it in jsfiddle
[09:36:56] <alexr2> Or if you can, share the link to the page you're having issues with
[09:37:05] <rabbi1> alexr2: http://jsfiddle.net/fXzSk/
[09:37:26] <rabbi1> alexr2: I have tried to put the exact code
[09:37:34] <F3rr31r4> hello can some one tell me how can i do this ? data = dataUrl: 'data.json',
[09:37:36] <rabbi1> but again, may work in jsfiddle......
[09:38:38] <Hawkee> finished my scroll append widget
[09:39:13] <alexr2> http://jsfiddle.net/fXzSk/1/ works fine
[09:39:24] <Hawkee> wasn't too hard, don't know why nobody's released a modern one lately
[09:40:33] <rabbi1> alexr2: thanks, but that was my point, may work there, cos nothing wrong with the code :(
[09:41:03] <rabbi1> alexr2: what are the reasons for datepicker not a function in firebug
[09:41:25] <alexr2> No clue, I don't use firebug
[09:41:37] <alexr2> I use chrome
[09:42:29] <foo> What suggests would you have for getting a background image to sacle to the width/height of the screen?
[09:43:00] <rabbi1> alexr2: even chrome says " Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'datepicker'
[09:43:52] <alexr2> rabbi1, try including the full jquery-ui
[09:43:59] <alexr2> Instead of a custom one that limits the plugins
[09:44:14] <alexr2> foo, css style 100% height and width
[09:44:22] <rabbi1> alexr2: yeah, trying that
[09:45:34] <rabbi1> alexr2: it's same even with full jquery-ui
[09:47:58] <rabbi1> alexr2: yeah, got the problem. i was importing another jquery, in the bottom of the page
[09:48:07] <rabbi1> silly mistake

[09:58:12] <PIlotBob> Hi folks.. looking for suggestion on how to handle.. using jqueryUI autocomplete. In the change event I have code to populate a hidden field with the key value. works fine if the user tabs off... but if he click the submitt button the value isn't in the POST values.
[09:58:48] <PIlotBob> I know change fires on blur.. but perhaps that isn't happening when submit is clicked?
[09:59:26] <PIlotBob> or is happens but the submit happens at the same time... I tried to change focus in a submit event handler but that doesn't seem to help.
[10:01:24] <majd> when i do .bind('click', function(){}), as in this code, why is the click event also triggered at the same time? http://dpaste.com/730214/
[10:02:17] <majd> i only want the bind, not the event to be triggered?
[10:04:34] <Whirl3d> Afternoon all. I keep using the line: this.siblings().add(this)  and wondered if I could easily make a plugin funciton called "peers" where $(this).peers() would return the item and it's siblings...
[10:05:35] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: there's see ?andSelf
[10:05:38] <PIlotBob> Hi folks.. looking for suggestion on how to handle.. using jqueryUI autocomplete. In the change event I have code to populate a hidden field with the key value. works fine if the user tabs off... but if he click the submitt button the value isn't in the POST values.
[10:06:02] <ajpiano> $.fn.peers = function() { return this.siblings().andSelf(); }
[10:06:20] <ajpiano> but they won't be in DOM order
[10:07:13] <Whirl3d> how do I apply selectors to it?  $.fn.peers=function () {return this.siblings().apply(this, arguments).andSelf.apply(this, arguments);}   maybe
[10:07:55] <ajpiano> filter ?
[10:08:08] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, when you say they wont be in dom order, that's because andSelf is appended to the end, right?
[10:08:16] <ajpiano> ep
[10:08:17] <ajpiano> yep
[10:08:39] <Whirl3d> is there a better way to get this included and keep the dom order?
[10:09:01] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: this.parents().children()
[10:09:08] <ajpiano> i mean this.parent().children()
[10:09:51] <spoonybard> what else can i use if trim() doesnt remove all the spaces and tabs?
[10:10:18] <Whirl3d> simple enough, huh? that's even easy with selectors, I suppose: $.fn.peers=function() {return this.parent().children().apply(this,arguments);}
[10:10:29] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, thanks again for  your help.
[10:10:37] <Eviltwin> Um...
[10:10:44] * Whirl3d shudders
[10:10:46] <Eviltwin> What are you trying to use the arguments for?
[10:11:22] <Whirl3d> like you would use for .prev and .next   to select a subset of elements
[10:11:53] <Whirl3d> which may or may not include 'this'
[10:12:08] <danzik17> Whirl3d: $.fn.peers = function( selector ) { var ret = this.parent().children();  return selector ? ret.filter( selector ) : ret; }
[10:12:11] <Eviltwin> $.fn.peers = function(filter) { return this.parent().children(filter); }
[10:12:20] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: just do $.fn.peers = function(selector) { return this.parent().children(selector) }
[10:12:20] <ajpiano> heh
[10:12:26] <Eviltwin> Nice
[10:12:34] <danzik17> or that.
[10:12:39] <Eviltwin> At least ajpiano and I are on the same page
[10:13:07] <ajpiano> :)
[10:13:38] <Whirl3d> simple enough, huh? I don't know why I have to make things harder than they need to be. I am learning though. Thanks again for the input.
[10:13:50] <Eviltwin> I didn't realize you could use the same arg name twice in a JavaScript function
[10:13:56] <Eviltwin> function foo(x,x,x) { ... }
[10:14:15] <Eviltwin> Not that there's any good reason to
[10:14:31] <Eviltwin> Just expected it to be some kind of error
[10:14:34] <danzik17> Eviltwin: what does 'x' resolve to in that case?  the first defined, or the last?
[10:14:47] <Eviltwin> Last
[10:14:48] <rroelofs> I'm betting on last
[10:14:48] <danzik17> but yea, seems errorish.
[10:15:03] <Eviltwin> foo(1,2) will have x be undefined
[10:15:07] <Eviltwin> foo(1,2,3,4) will have x be 3
[10:15:56] <Eviltwin> ?js function foo(x,x,x) { return x; } foo(1,2,3,4)
[10:16:03] <rroelofs> Yep, I was betting that the interpreter just takes the arguments array ans assigns them positionally
[10:16:09] <Whirl3d> is there any "magic" way (and by magic, I mean somebody smarter than I has already figured it out) to ensure that only one element of a particular class exists within a group of elements?
[10:16:45] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Any time you add it to something you first remove it from any elements that have it within that group
[10:19:45] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/SxJaH/
[10:19:47] <Eviltwin> Like that
[10:20:42] <Whirl3d> sure. that's how I do it now. but I was wondering if it was going to be fruitless to setup a method that automatically did that for me...like $.fn.uniqueClass=function (clname) {return this.siblings(clname).removeClass(clname).end().addClass(clname);}
[10:20:49] <Whirl3d> looking now...
[10:20:55] <DannyZB> Guys : who here writes jQuery plug-ins well ?
[10:21:31] <DannyZB> I'm trying to convert some code to a plug-in and I'm not sure how you create permanent plug-in variables
[10:22:16] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: The code you've proposed is specific to a very particular use case
[10:22:40] <Eviltwin> Which is where you don't want to remove the class from the siblings but nothing else
[10:23:05] <Eviltwin> I'd probably try to make it at least a little more generic
[10:23:22] <Eviltwin> Where maybe you specify the selector for .closest to find the "group"
[10:23:28] <Eviltwin> And the class
[10:24:14] <Eviltwin> Also what you proposed won't work
[10:24:25] <Eviltwin> .siblings needs a selector, not a class name
[10:24:38] <Eviltwin> So you can do "."+clname
[10:25:01] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/SxJaH/2/
[10:26:28] <Whirl3d> I just noticed that. Thanks for pointing it out. Now I am wrapping my head around your prior comment
[10:26:48] <PIlotBob> so , is there a way to delay the submitt until all the events on the page have fired?
[10:27:26] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: What about this? http://jsfiddle.net/SxJaH/3/
[10:28:15] <Eviltwin> What I want to happen is this: http://jsfiddle.net/SxJaH/5/
[10:28:32] <Whirl3d> Brilliant. But how do I easily determine the level of the group
[10:28:49] <Eviltwin> .closest
[10:28:52] <Eviltwin> And a selector
[10:29:46] <Whirl3d> so, maybe I can include the selector as an optional parameter
[10:30:33] <PavelloZ|home> Eviltwin: i always wonder, why would you do that: var $this = $(this)
[10:30:45] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: What I was suggesting was this: http://jsfiddle.net/SxJaH/6/
[10:30:45] <PavelloZ|home> whats the benefit
[10:31:24] <Eviltwin> PavelloZ|home: Every time you do $(...) it requires the construction of a new jQuery object
[10:31:36] <Eviltwin> It's wasteful to do it a bunch of times when you don't need to
[10:31:47] <PavelloZ|home> ouh f**, eye-opener
[10:32:17] <PavelloZ|home> and $ before this is because this is reserved?
[10:32:24] <PavelloZ|home> "this"
[10:33:42] <Eviltwin> PavelloZ|home: Right, you can't do this = $(this);
[10:33:45] <Eviltwin> Won't work
[10:33:53] <Whirl3d> this was my attempt at the same thing. Yours, of course, is much nicer Eviltwin. http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/SxJaH/8/
[10:34:31] <PavelloZ|home> and I was assigning jquery selectors to variables only when it appared more than once in the code... but i guess it is kinda similar logic
[10:34:44] <PavelloZ|home> code -> function
[10:34:52] <aboudreault> Hi, hey what selector should I use to get an element a, which have the value 'HELLO' ? ie. <a ...>HELLO</a>
[10:35:01] <Whirl3d> returned too early
[10:35:09] <spoonybard> how can i remove spaces that trim() and replace(/ /g,"") didnt remove?
[10:35:42] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Why assume the selector must be a class?
[10:36:00] <Whirl3d> Good point...good point.
[10:36:26] <PavelloZ|home> Eviltwin: and could you explain why did you used .end() twice in that fiddle?
[10:38:00] <Eviltwin> PavelloZ|home: Do you know what .end() does?
[10:38:07] <RealityBall> hello I get this error [10:35:25.239] uncaught exception: TypeError: $("#showtime") is null what does it mean?

[10:41:38] <_dave_h_d> hi all have an object , when i console.log it in ff it shows all the properties, when i console.dir it it is missing one of the properties named "matches" is this a reserved word of some sort?
[10:42:20] <PavelloZ|home> damn, webchat disconnected me, Eviltwin did my question about using end() twice appeared?
[10:42:27] <Eviltwin> PavelloZ|home: Do you know what .end() does?
[10:42:46] <PavelloZ|home> i would like to know when to use it more than once
[10:43:19] <Eviltwin> Okay, let's say I do var x = $("body").find("div").find("p").end()
[10:43:26] <Eviltwin> What does x now represent?
[10:44:38] <Eviltwin> PavelloZ|home: This isn't intended to be a trick question
[10:44:52] <Eviltwin> If you know what .end() does it should be really easy to tell me
[10:46:47] <PavelloZ|home> hmm
[10:46:56] <PavelloZ|home> you find the p inside the div
[10:47:10] <PavelloZ|home> so its a collection in one case, or one object in the other
[10:47:14] <PavelloZ|home> or empty
[10:47:37] <PavelloZ|home> but in case i understand end, it returns body
[10:47:50] <PavelloZ|home> $("body")
[10:47:50] <PavelloZ|home> to be exact
[10:48:32] <shoky> doubts
[10:48:48] <PavelloZ|home> well, everybody need to learn some time ;)
[10:50:19] <Eviltwin> PavelloZ|home: It does not return the same thing as $("body")
[10:50:27] <Eviltwin> It returns the same thing as $("body").find("div")
[10:51:38] <PavelloZ|home> mhm
[10:52:00] <PavelloZ|home> so it is a step backward in case of selecting chained methods
[10:52:19] <PavelloZ|home> if "selecting chained methods" is named somehow
[10:54:12] <shoky> it "ends" the last .find()
[10:54:14] <Eviltwin> PavelloZ|home: http://api.jquery.com/end/
[10:54:27] <Eviltwin> PavelloZ|home, shoky: It ends the last DOM traversal
[10:54:31] <Eviltwin> Any of these: http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/
[10:55:02] <Eviltwin> Okay, most of those
[10:55:10] <Eviltwin> An .end() doesn't end an .end()
[10:55:42] <PavelloZ|home> it should take an parameter then and if i want to end 3 finds back, .end(3) would make a sense
[10:56:09] <Eviltwin> It doesn't for the same reason .parent doesn't take a number
[10:56:11] <PavelloZ|home> but i guess if it was that easy, it would be done ;)
[10:56:18] <shoky> yes i was just referring to the specific excersize
[10:56:59] <Eviltwin> If you're doing it enough times in a row that you don't actually want to type .end() out that many times, you're probably doing something horribly wrong
[10:57:44] <Nico___> greetings

[11:00:19] <MeXTuX> I have a problem with jQueryUI Datepicker. When I schedule a new event the Datepicker works quite well but on edition mode the date fields has an initial value and when I click the field calendar doesn't show. There are no errors on the javascript console. This is the field as it appears <input type="text" name="evaluation_startdate" id="evaluation_startdate" value="22/03/2012" class="date">
[11:01:14] <shoky> ?demo @ MeXTuX
[11:01:14] <bot-t> MeXTuX, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:04:37] <Nico___> I'm currently using jquery 1.7.1 and live() is deprecated, I try to use the new on() method but I'm unlucky: I have two events 'mouseenter' and 'mouseleave' bound to a div, when I destroy the div in the DOM and I recreate it, the event is still listened with live() but not anymore with on()
[11:05:06] <shoky> you need to delegate the event handling to some container element
[11:05:14] <shoky> one that does not get destroyed
[11:05:23] <PavelloZ|home> there should be a fiddle in topic about that one
[11:05:28] <shoky> read the 'event delegation' part in the .on() docs

[11:44:56] <sekretskwerl> blindMoe: I have not. I try to only be a backend dev, but my current task is frontend
[11:44:58] <jonkristian> Other then that, the input gets added outside of the ui.draggable which is an li
[11:45:16] <jonkristian> but if it's outside it is harder remove it on out
[11:45:19] <blindMoe> select2 has some great autopopulate drop downlist functionality
[11:53:15] <Whirl3d> so how do you get the index of an element in a collection where the elements aren't siblings?
[11:55:11] <Eviltwin> You still use .index
[11:55:19] <Eviltwin> But you use collection.index(element)
[12:00:18] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/SxJaH/33/     so close
[12:00:46] <Eviltwin> You know that you can do "Run" without "Update" right?
[12:02:27] <Whirl3d> Yeah. Chrome was locking up on me for a while and I just got in the habit of updating to keep from losing shit.
[12:03:27] <Nico___> sorry, I come back because i'm very confused about on() and delegate() and I tried many differents ways. So very simply, can you help me to convert this : $('div').live('click', function(){ $(this).css({'color':'red'}) }); to the on() or delegate() method? Knowing that the 'div' can be removed and added to the DOM many times (i use the 1.7.1 version)
[12:04:07] <Eviltwin> Nico___: $(document).on('click', 'div', ...);
[12:05:22] <sekretskwerl> blindMoe: i'm not finding a plugin called select2
[12:06:14] <blindMoe> sekretskwerl: one sec
[12:06:18] <shoky> took me a while to find it too ;p
[12:06:21] <Nico___> Eviltwin: thanks, i go to try it right know :)
[12:06:31] <shoky> http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/
[12:06:33] <blindMoe> sekretskwerl: http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/
[12:06:39] <blindMoe> hehe shoky beat me to it
[12:06:41] <shoky> ;p
[12:06:52] <shoky> i was prepared
[12:09:03] <blendedbychris> anyone suggest an <audio> playeR?
[12:09:05] <blendedbychris> player*
[12:09:12] <blendedbychris> degradable...
[12:09:36] <Nico___> Eviltwin: thanks, it works very well, actually I was confused about the parent element bound with the on() method, now it's clear ;)
[12:10:37] <Eviltwin> The problem with .live is it's very misleading in terms of how it actually works
[12:10:49] <Eviltwin> Which is why the .delegate and .on syntaxes are preferred
[12:10:53] <Eviltwin> Well, part of why
[12:13:49] <Nico___> ok :)
[12:14:36] <fotoflo> https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/p2zFqqskFM4?v=2 <--- what should i use to parse this?
[12:17:38] <Raverix> fotoflo: That'
[12:17:59] <Raverix> fotoflo: That's standard XML...
[12:19:10] <Raverix> Are you looking for something that'll specifically handle the Atom part?
[12:19:30] <fotoflo> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[12:19:36] <fotoflo> this will work?
[12:20:58] <Raverix> Yes, that will... but if this is being requested via ajax...
[12:21:05] <Raverix> You can use dataType to automatically handle it.
[12:22:00] <jcrben> hey does anyone have some time to help me out a bit?
[12:22:23] <jcrben> I'm a complete newb... trying to work with json data output from a mysql database but I can't seem to get it to work
[12:22:56] <fotoflo> so $.ajax will likely know what it is by mime type and return a JSON to me?
[12:23:29] <fotoflo> jcrben: do you have an example?
[12:24:14] <jcrben> I've been using http://jhoyimperial.wordpress.com/2008/07/28/parsing-json-data-from-php-using-jquery/ as a model
[12:24:50] <jcrben> I have a database with some data
[12:25:10] <jcrben> encoded it to json and returned it with an xmlHttp object
[12:25:17] <jcrben> at first I was trying to just figure out the regular xmlHttp
[12:25:34] <jcrben> but I was finding that I could not really work with the json data - could not even stringify it and just output it as text
[12:26:05] <DannyZB> jquery.getJSON ()
[12:26:09] <DannyZB> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[12:26:52] <theotherguy> do you know a plugin or such which shows the next form field as we fill up the form?
[12:27:13] <jcrben> the website is badcapitalist.com
[12:27:14] <jcrben> so
[12:27:16] <jcrben> so
[12:27:21] <DannyZB> theotherguy: what do you mean by .. "shows" ?
[12:27:28] <DannyZB> focuses on ?
[12:27:57] <theotherguy> no say there's a form with name, email, address, initially only name field is visible, email shows up when name is filled
[12:28:04] <jcrben> here's a specific example: in the website model that I'm using, the json data has the name "userdata"
[12:28:29] <DannyZB> theotherguy: implement a "keyup" event
[12:28:47] <DannyZB> if a field has a length you consider long enough you can show and focus on the next field
[12:29:00] <theotherguy> gotcha
[12:29:36] <theotherguy> how can I do multiple binds? I want to do something, on body load and button is clicked
[12:30:39] <DannyZB> theyotherguy : you bind twice lol
[12:30:50] <chovy> theotherguy: $(function(){ $("a").click(function(e){} });
[12:31:21] <theotherguy> I can't do everything in one .bind call?
[12:31:51] <DannyZB> theotherguy : a bind call takes a jquery object , which can reference several different elements
[12:32:08] <DannyZB> just binding different events of different elements sounds a bit off to me
[12:32:22] <DannyZB> create a function and bind both of them to it
[12:33:56] <theotherguy> I have a checkbox and a notification, if checkbox is checked I want to show the notification, on page load notification is hidden, sometimes the checkbox comes checked from the server, so in that case I have to call the notification visibility function on body load
[12:35:12] <DannyZB> theotherguy : don't overcomplicate it
[12:35:19] <DannyZB> create a function shownotification() { }
[12:35:25] <DannyZB> and bind both events to call it
[12:36:25] <theotherguy> ok
[12:39:49] <RealityBall> DannyZB: i made some headway on that problem you were helping me with yesterday if you remember
[12:40:02] <DannyZB> cool man
[12:40:08] <RealityBall> turns out I was missing a parentheses but now I get an error
[12:40:39] <RealityBall> [11:05:53.993] uncaught exception: TypeError: $("#showtime") is null
[12:41:08] <batousai> how can i get rid of two or more spaces instead of one?
[12:42:16] <DannyZB> well .. is it there ?
[12:42:32] <RealityBall> yeah and I even logged it with console
[12:42:39] <chee> batousai: what are you asking
[12:43:13] <batousai> chee, can i get rid of whitespace greater than 1?
[12:48:58] <RealityBall> if anyone wants to take a look and see if you can help me out my site is here http://ideatest.nfshost.com/
[12:49:33] <RealityBall> script I wanna run is here http://pastebin.com/ckMkztQU
[12:50:24] <DannyZB> running  f$("#showtime") from the console works perfectly
[12:50:42] <RealityBall> try running the script
[12:50:46] <RealityBall> then clicking the one
[12:50:53] <RealityBall> you will see the error
[12:51:08] <DannyZB> LOL
[12:51:10] <DannyZB> it works
[12:51:15] <RealityBall> wat
[12:51:22] <DannyZB> exactly what you've heard
[12:51:26] <DannyZB> copy-paste viola
[12:51:34] <n00b2373> anyone in here use fancy box? I'm having a problem where my gallery is being duplicated. k
[12:51:57] <RealityBall> this is what I get
[12:52:01] <RealityBall> when I click on 1 [12:51:44.265] uncaught exception: TypeError: $("#showtime") is null
[12:52:02] <DannyZB> maybe you ran $(document).ready twice ?
[12:52:07] <RealityBall> lol
[12:52:12] <RealityBall> is that what can cause it?
[12:52:27] <DannyZB> maybe yea
[12:52:33] <DannyZB> seriously the code is 100% correct
[12:52:36] <DannyZB> the problem is elsewhere
[12:52:41] <RealityBall> how is it working for you and not me
[12:52:49] <DannyZB> because it likes me better probably
[12:52:52] <RealityBall> hahaha
[12:53:10] <RealityBall> you just copy paste it in developer console right?
[12:53:12] <RealityBall> then click 1?
[12:53:16] <DannyZB> yea
[12:53:17] <n00b2373> humm i'm not seeing that. but maybe...
[12:53:24] <Whirl3d> var indx=5; indx=indx<0?group.length:index>group.length?group.length%indx:indx;   why doesn't this return to 0 when indx>group.length?
[12:53:32] <DannyZB> without the document.ready thing ofcourse
[12:53:39] <RealityBall> oh really?
[12:53:51] <RealityBall> why do you do it without the document ready?
[12:54:02] <RealityBall> oh
[12:54:05] <RealityBall> the document is ready
[12:54:07] <DannyZB> becauuseee .. it wouldn't run after the document has loaded ?
[12:54:07] <RealityBall> when you
[12:54:08] <RealityBall> oh
[12:54:12] <RealityBall> hahha
[12:54:15] <DannyZB> kids
[12:54:19] <DannyZB> don't do crack
[12:54:21] <RealityBall> oh lawd
[12:54:30] <RealityBall> okay so if I just take out the document.ready
[12:54:36] <RealityBall> and put it on the bottom
[12:54:40] <RealityBall> it will probably work out for me
[12:54:59] <DannyZB> well .. yea .. but thats ugly coding and you wouldn't know where the problem is
[12:55:06] <DannyZB> stuff like that hides other errors you want to know
[12:55:35] <RealityBall> well I can't seem to get it to work with $(document).ready
[12:55:57] <jonkristian> One thing left to do, i need to remove element on droppable out, any ideas? http://pastebin.com/munpgghx
[12:55:59] <DannyZB> what else do you do with jquery before that ?
[12:56:05] <DannyZB> turn off all other scripts and see if it works
[12:56:18] <DannyZB> go over the scripts one by one to see which one is breaking it
[12:56:24] <RealityBall> huh?
[12:56:35] <DannyZB> you have no other JS on the page ?
[12:56:36] <fatninja> I have something like <div id="wrap"> <element></element> <button>Add</button> </div> , when I click Add I want to add something before the Add button, and before <element></element> any ideas how ?
[12:56:37] <RealityBall> there is only this script and the minimalized jquery script
[12:56:42] <RealityBall> thats it
[12:56:54] <fatninja> .prepend() doesn't do the trick
[12:57:29] <NoiseEee> fatninja: http://api.jquery.com/before/
[12:57:45] <DannyZB> one sec
[12:57:51] <RealityBall> ok
[12:58:09] <fatninja> NoiseEee tnks
[12:58:39] <n00b2373> http://2012.delineamultimedia.com/delinea.html -> if you click on portfolio then image 1 icon fancy box is activated but it goes to image 4 of 6... i only have 3 images in that gallery... i can't find out why its being duplicated
[12:58:55] <FrozenFire> Question about the best way to write the code for storing an array via jQuery.data(); I'm hooking into an event that deals with the handling of a bunch of pieces of information. I need to associate that information with elements on a page. What's the most effective way to write the code for that? (continuing on new line)
[12:59:56] <FrozenFire> Right now I have something like if(!($("element").data("key") instanceof Array)) $("element").data("key", []); $("element").data("key").push(value);
[13:00:18] <FrozenFire> But that seems like a round-about way to initialize the array for the data
[13:01:15] <DannyZB> realityball : put an alert in that script ( inside document.ready ) to see if it's even being executed
[13:01:41] <RealityBall> DannyZB: how do I put alert?
[13:01:52] <DannyZB> alert("work");
[13:01:58] <DannyZB> it just shows a messagebox
[13:03:13] <RealityBall> DannyZB: okay no nothing happens
[13:03:40] <DannyZB> you didn't .. I'm looking at it now
[13:03:58] <DannyZB> oh yea
[13:04:00] <DannyZB> now I see
[13:04:04] <RealityBall> lol
[13:04:07] <DannyZB> now put the alert before document.ready
[13:04:14] <DannyZB> maybe the script isn't even being loaded
[13:04:38] <RealityBall> yeah nothing
[13:04:41] <RealityBall> weird
[13:04:46] <fatninja> I have an element <element id="blabla">things</element> , how do I get the contents of id="blabla" AND the tags surrounding it, I mean, how do I get this : "<element id="blabla">things</element>"
[13:04:54] <DannyZB> super wierd
[13:05:09] <DannyZB> so the code is ok
[13:05:19] <fatninja> I mean, automatically of course, without specifying the tag myself
[13:05:30] <RealityBall> should I just try to put the script in script tags on the index page?
[13:05:36] <RealityBall> lets see if that works
[13:05:42] <DannyZB> it would work .. definitely
[13:05:42] <fatninja> And without making a parent, that would work as well
[13:05:50] <DannyZB> still unexplained
[13:06:28] <RealityBall> no it doesn't even work
[13:07:53] <DannyZB> well .. I'm just guessing but try removing the doctype and xmlns
[13:08:19] <DannyZB> your xmlns doesn't even match your doctype heh
[13:08:23] <RealityBall> what... errm okay I will comment them out
[13:08:52] <RealityBall> lol well its not working
[13:09:16] <DannyZB> Phantom errors ... gotta hate them
[13:10:50] <RealityBall> DannyZB: why are the phantoms after me?
[13:11:00] <RealityBall> DannyZB: what have I done?
[13:11:04] <jonkristian> Ok, almost working now. However sometime when i drag the element it's original gets removed, and sometimes the input is added outside of the li. Any ideas? http://pastebin.com/46Jvs7kz
[13:11:21] <DannyZB> There are 3 solutions to phantom errors
[13:11:24] <DannyZB> 1. fix the proglem
[13:11:27] <DannyZB> problem *
[13:11:30] <DannyZB> 2. kill yourself
[13:11:41] <DannyZB> 3. delete the page and rewrite it then blame someone else
[13:12:25] <RealityBall> hahahaha there is no way I am rewriting this page but I will def try to see if I can do it in javascript
[13:12:38] <RealityBall> and see if that makes it better for some weird reason
[13:12:51] <RealityBall> DannyZB: thanks very much though
[13:13:47] <SeanFallon> Those are good tips DannyZB, I will keep those in mind.
[13:14:30] <SeanFallon> well, minuis the killing yourself, normally the person who is upset that whatever one wrote isn't working will already try to seek a hasty death on the coder.
[13:14:31] <SeanFallon> lol
[13:15:36] <DannyZB> hey if you love living .. just kill somebody who doesn't
[13:15:55] <DannyZB> RealityBall : np .. it's probably a problem in the stages before that script
[13:16:10] <krz> trigger a link
[13:16:13] <DannyZB> try puting an alert before loading scripts/css
[13:16:23] <krz> how does one trigger a link?
[13:16:34] <krz> i tried $('.download_link a').trigger('click'); to no avail
[13:17:18] <DannyZB> krz : document.location.href = $('#page-contact').attr('href');
[13:19:42] <krz> thanks DannyZB
[13:25:01] <jonkristian> hm, when using several droppable divs, the dragged item disappears if i drag it over more than one before i drop.
[13:25:03] <eternalswd_work> I'm using setInterval to run a .getJSON and I'm noticing something strange.  The delay between keeps increasing.  It starts fine, but then every 6-12 times the callback runs, the delay increases, first to 2x the original then to 3x and so on.  I've also tried using setTimeout recursively with the same issue.  I've tried Firefox, Safari, and Chrome and all exhibit this issue.  Any ideas?
[13:27:03] <kavelot> I have an API that returns, after an AJAX request, the name of a file that should be downloaded. If there a way to make the browser open the "download dialog" for this file? (it's a JPEG, so I can't just redirect the user to the URL)
[13:27:19] <eternalswd_work> This is the only script running, so I don't think it's a thread delay issue.  I've also run it continuously for several days, and the delay keeps increasing in this fashion.
[13:29:25] <eternalswd_work> kavelot, do you have control of the host?  Only way I know of is to modify the mime type in the headers, which you can do if you serve the jpeg using php or something similar.  At least that's what I did for mp3's once.
[13:30:02] <DannyZB> kavelot : exactly .. you want the mime time to be application/octet-stream
[13:30:21] <DannyZB> browsers choose what to do with files themselves there is no way around that
[13:30:25] <kavelot> so i basically need to create a download.php or something like that
[13:30:28] <DannyZB> type *
[13:30:30] <DannyZB> yea
[13:30:36] <kavelot> that will return the .jpg file with a downloadable header
[13:30:44] <eternalswd_work> exactly
[13:30:45] <kavelot> ok, thanks
[13:31:58] <krz> DannyZB: actually thats not what i want. since it halts the page from being loaded
[13:32:17] <DannyZB> kavelot : btw .. if you have access to the file server some scripting may tell the server to treat all jpeg files like application/octet-stream .. I don't remember exactly how but there is something of the sort in apache
[13:32:40] <DannyZB> what do you mean "halts the page " ?
[13:32:52] <krz> it prevents the page from loading completely
[13:33:18] <DannyZB> of course it does ... thats what happens when you click a link
[13:33:24] <DannyZB> you want it to wait for the page to load ?
[13:33:53] <krz> yea
[13:34:27] <DannyZB> it's an in-page link ? (Like #place )
[13:34:32] <krz> ah i think it needs to be on page ready
[13:34:53] <DannyZB> krz : probably
[13:42:34] <Lobster> hi... is there a neat way to make jquery animate the transition from an element's default state to hover state, while retaining the no-script behaviour?
[13:43:53] <Whirl3d> css
[13:44:35] <Lobster> Whirl3d: transition property?
[13:44:51] <Lobster> webkit's implementation is buggy for my application
[13:44:57] <Lobster> so I'd like to script it
[13:44:59] <Whirl3d> http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/CreativeCSS3AnimationMenus/
[13:46:22] <Lobster> yep... so assuming I can't use css3, what's the best I can do with jquery?
[13:47:09] <Whirl3d> how do you expect jquery to work with noscript?
[13:47:15] <poppiez> is there any way to determine what dimensions a div will take if applying another width to it without actually doing it? depending on the text, etc. the height might be different
[13:47:46] <poppiez> I need to position a div but first I need to know how much space it needs
[13:47:48] <Lobster> Whirl3d: I don't, I expect the element to have a hover style with noscript
[13:48:06] <gnarf> ?g jquery ui animate class @Lobster
[13:48:08] <bot-t> Lobster, jQuery UI - Documentation: UI/Effects/Methods - http://jqueryui.com/docs/Effects/Methods
[13:48:42] <gnarf> Lobster: with jQuery UI Effects Core you get $().addClass( "hover", duration )
[13:49:37] <Lobster> gnarf: if the css declaration is :hover, won't that conflict?
[13:49:44] <MysterOnyx> I have an issue where I'm creating an html select box within javascript... it loads the select box, which has a specific id, after document.ready. The problem is, my scripts which try to manipulate that select box aren't working. I guess this is because I'm loading the select box after document.ready's been run? The reason I'm loading the select box via javascript is because I need to manipulate the options displayed.
[13:50:42] <Whirl3d> MysterOnyx, what do you mean "isn't working"?
[13:50:50] <gnarf> Lobster: use <body class="no-js"> ... $(function() { $("body").removeClass("no-js"); }); and ".no-js .class:hover, .class.hover" as your selector for the hover state
[13:51:19] <Lobster> ah, that's a nice way to do it, thanks gnarf :)
[13:51:55] <MysterOnyx> Whirl3d, for example, when I do $("id").attr("disabled", true); nothing happens.
[13:52:11] <gnarf> MysterOnyx: $("#id") ?
[13:52:17] <MysterOnyx> err yea #id
[13:52:19] <NoiseEee> $('#id").attr('disabled','disabled')
[13:52:22] <gnarf> also
[13:52:34] <gnarf> if you are using jQuery 1.6+ you should be using .prop( "disabled", true )
[13:52:38] <gnarf> not .attr
[13:52:42] <MysterOnyx> oh ok
[13:53:02] <MysterOnyx> I'll change that.
[13:54:16] <krz> DannyZB: how do i do something like this; window.location.href = $('.download_link a').delay(5000).attr('href');
[13:54:26] <krz> after 5 seconds trigger the link
[13:58:03] <DannyZB> krz : delay is just a pretty cover for settimeout
[13:58:07] <DannyZB> you can use it directly
[13:59:02] <DannyZB> setTimeout(" window.location.href = $('.download_link a').attr('href');",5000)
[13:59:47] <Lobster> I guess you could also do $('.download_link a').delay(5000).each(function(){ window.location.href = $(this).attr('href'); }); if you insisted on jquery
[13:59:49] <MysterOnyx> nevermind I figured out why the select wasn't "working". Thanks for the help
[14:00:33] <gnarf> DannyZB: never ever use a string argument to setTimeout - its evil
[14:00:37] <gnarf> evil to eval
[14:01:09] <DannyZB> Lobster : nice nice
[14:01:30] <gnarf> krz: but yeah - setTimeout( function() { $(".download_link a").attr("href"); }, 5000)
[14:01:40] <DannyZB> gnarf: first time I've ever seen it done this way hehe
[14:01:46] <DannyZB> ( with a string )
[14:01:49] <DannyZB> had to try it
[14:02:35] <DannyZB> btw after I'm done waging war against GIT my first opensource would go live =D
[14:02:50] <DannyZB> accidentally uploaded a password and it doesn't wanna delete it
[14:02:52] <Lobster> is it possible to control the number of steps in an animation?
[14:03:18] <DannyZB> what do you mean by steps ?
[14:03:25] <Lobster> frames
[14:04:32] <Lobster> for example http://jsfiddle.net/GGKyz/ - I'm animating an element whose position depends on both margins and absolute position
[14:04:55] <Lobster> so the images should stay still when you hover them, but they actually jiggle around by a pixel
[14:05:07] <MysterOnyx> gnarf my problem stemmed from me using attr instead of prop
[14:05:09] <MysterOnyx> so thanks
[14:05:13] <yedimind> that's the jiggling pixel bug
[14:05:55] <DannyZB> I don't know whats going on there
[14:05:55] <Lobster> yedimind: is that actually a thing?
[14:05:58] <DannyZB> but it's wierding me out
[14:06:56] <Lobster> DannyZB: it's simpler than it looks, promise!
[14:07:10] <yedimind> Lobster, no its not
[14:07:13] <DannyZB> it's jiggly because of the low framerate
[14:07:21] <DannyZB> And I'm not even sure you can control that
[14:07:32] <DannyZB> or some rounding issue
[14:07:38] <DannyZB> definitely not "simple" hehe
[14:07:49] <dannN> Hi. I'm writing some jQuery functions in combination with the MooTools class. I've a problem on line 141 the console says: this.addButton is no a function. http://pastebin.com/qpcdnq9Y
[14:09:26] <dannN> CvBox.addButton() also doesn't work.
[14:10:06] <Lobster> ok look, if you take the animation out and just flip between 2 states, you can make the image stay still
[14:10:09] <DannyZB> Lobster : Looks to me like it's a combination of the width + position animation thats "getting jiggy with it "
[14:10:12] <Lobster> http://jsfiddle.net/A5jmh/3/
[14:11:05] <DannyZB> Lobster : Solved it !
[14:11:07] <Lobster> if you add n to the hover margin, top and left values, and 2n to the hover width and height values, then the image stays still
[14:11:14] <DannyZB> instead of changing the position use a negative margin
[14:11:38] <DannyZB> one sec .. no
[14:11:39] <DannyZB> lol
[14:11:41] <DannyZB> something else
[14:11:45] <DannyZB> I somehow got it to work
[14:12:24] <Lobster> http://jsfiddle.net/GGKyz/1/ :(
[14:12:43] <Lobster> that is neater though, I don't know how I got to combining margins and absolute positioning
[14:12:50] <Lobster> but still with the jiggle
[14:13:14] <Lobster> I guess jquery is animating frames for the odd number widths and heights
[14:13:28] <DannyZB> Lobster ...
[14:13:43] <DannyZB> 100/61 isn't the same ratio as 120/81
[14:13:50] <DannyZB> maybe thats the issue
[14:14:08] <Lobster> no, because that container is overflowing
[14:14:42] <Lobster> the key is for the margins + width to add up to 120 and 81
[14:14:51] <DannyZB> nope .. anyway .. it's not a bug
[14:15:05] <DannyZB> it's just correct behaviour that doesn't fit the situation
[14:15:15] <Lobster> yep
[14:15:36] <Lobster> but if I could control the number of frames
[14:16:01] <Lobster> ooh... I guess I could animate the margins and use a callback to set the correct width/height values
[14:16:17] <MysterOnyx> New problem. When I comment out line 73, autocomplete, which is at line 20, works fine. When I de-comment line 73, however, autocomplete stops working. I was guessing that it's because line 73 reprints the object with the id autocomplete is tied to. But I don't understand why that would happen since I can still manipulate it with other functions. Anyone have an idea? http://pastebin.com/dFM9Zxpf
[14:19:35] <Guest6592> Hi
[14:22:42] <revenge_potato> I'm using .slideToggle() to show/hide a textbox in a table. If my toggle button is outside of the table, it works as expected. However, if I put the same toggle button in a td in the table, the page gets refreshed whenever the button is pushed and I have no idea why....any ideas?
[14:30:40] <Lobster> hang on... DannyZB: do you know if my method of animation, $().animate().parent().animate() runs the two animations synchronously?
[14:31:19] <DannyZB> If I remember correctly it doesn't
[14:31:41] <Lobster> so maybe that's actually the cause of my woes
[14:32:00] <DannyZB> oh 1 sec
[14:32:05] <DannyZB> yes it does ><
[14:32:11] <Lobster> ok
[14:37:22] <DannyZB> HA I win GIT .. for now
[14:40:33] <catcherdev> Is there any better way to get slide easing for .show than grabbing a small jquery UI library?
[14:41:06] <DannyZB> http://api.jquery.com/animate/ ?
[14:42:23] <catcherdev> DannyZB, aha, and I'm guessing that's all the ui library does?
[14:42:34] <catcherdev> (for that sort of thing, I mean)
[14:42:44] <DannyZB> probably ... never looked into it
[14:46:53] <Whirl3d> that and draggable, sortable, droppable, etc. It's a lot more than just a "pretty-upper" for jquery
[14:48:16] <miket3> what would be the code to clear the  contents of the search field in datatables?  Instead of backspacing I would like to click on the title to clear the whole field at once.  It is an aria-control input type.
[14:48:54] <DannyZB> I never used them separately I can barely remember whats the difference
[14:49:05] <DannyZB> lots of plugins are jQueryUI-only sooo
[14:50:09] <catcherdev> Whirl3d, right-o, I meant more that jquery UI's nice .show('slide') is probably just a wrapper around animate.
[14:50:39] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I always code my own "show" animations
[14:51:08] <catcherdev> good to know, ty
[14:51:18] <Whirl3d> except now I am using css3 tranforms with transit.js (for hardware accel on ios devices).
[14:53:25] <catcherdev> miket3, not sure specific to datatables, but you can make a click handler that set the value of the search form to ''.
[14:54:07] <miket3> catcherdev, ty  i think i found something like object.setAttribute("aria-controls",value)
[14:54:15] <gnarf> catcherdev: actually the code for slide is pretty simple
[14:54:49] <catcherdev> gnarf, animating show via a slide up?  I've got it running with jquery ui, but I'd like to swap it out.
[14:55:00] <gnarf> catcherdev: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.effects.slide.js
[14:55:12] <gnarf> catcherdev: someone else was working on a way to do it with clip instead of the wrapper element
[14:55:23] <gnarf> lemme see if I can find the pull
[14:55:48] <catcherdev> thanks gnarf
[14:56:43] <DannyZB> gnarf : https://github.com/DannyZB/jDiskOnline
[14:56:49] <DannyZB> all PHP conversion DONE
[14:57:01] <DannyZB> tomorrow I'll rewrite the JS code for it to work correctly
[14:57:03] <DannyZB> and it's a go
[14:57:11] <mllie> Hello
[14:58:00] <mllie> I have a toggleable div that are repositioned with media queries. How do I solve it so also the toggle button is repositioned and even more important changing image?
[14:59:49] <DannyZB> millie : whats the issue ?
[15:00:03] <gnarf> catcherdev: https://github.com/SineSwiper/jquery-ui/compare/master...clip_step
[15:00:12] <gnarf> catcherdev: there is a lot of code there
[15:00:21] <gnarf> ?glwt @catcherdev
[15:00:22] <bot-t> catcherdev, http://goodluckwiththatdude.com
[15:00:27] <gnarf> i gotta run
[15:00:42] <catcherdev> ty gnarf, see you soon
[15:01:42] <mllie> DannyZB: That the image is not swapped
[15:01:49] <mllie> DannyZB: when resizing the window
[15:01:59] <DannyZB> swapped as in replaced with another image ?
[15:02:54] <mllie> DannyZB: correct
[15:03:23] <DannyZB> either use $(image_object).attr("src","newimage")
[15:03:43] <DannyZB> or use a div with a background image and replace the class on the required event
[15:04:37] <mllie> DannyZB: So the only way is actually to check when window is resized?
[15:04:55] <DannyZB> It's like you're speaking chinesse
[15:05:10] <Lobster> once css has been applied with jquery, is there any way to revert an element back to the styles applied in the static style sheets?
[15:05:23] <mllie> DannyZB: what?
[15:05:37] <DannyZB> Lobster : the .css function applies the changes to the inline style
[15:05:49] <DannyZB> you can just remove the inline style completely if it's getting in the way
[15:05:56] <Lobster> ah, so attr('style','')?
[15:06:02] <DannyZB> exactly
[15:06:12] <Lobster> cheers
[15:06:45] <mllie> DannyZB: So I actually need to hook into window resize event and then change the toggle-button-bg?
[15:08:14] <DannyZB> what does it have to do with window resize? whats the event anyway ?
[15:08:17] <DannyZB> you're really unclear
[15:20:41] <Lobster> I want to fetch a css px value, do some arithmetic with it, and set it as a css property for a different element... do I just have to strip out the number from the string, or does jquery have a nice way to handle numbers in the px format?

[15:24:27] <mod> hey all, I'm trying to set a dialog to modal.  It seems to work in that form items don't work, but I do not see the overlay as described by the docs
[15:24:50] <mod> i want to opacify this overlay
[15:25:14] <mod> i'm guessing the overlay is a z-indexed layer below the dialog and above the highest z-index on the page?
[15:25:37] <Eviltwin> Lobster: Just use parseInt/parseFloat
[15:25:42] <mod> hrm yeah when i inspect around the dialog, i get the <body>
[15:26:48] <mod> http://pastebin.com/UpB0M84e
[15:29:06] <jmole> my jquery code is working if i paste it into the javascript console, but not inside a script tag
[15:29:32] <jmole> buy if I put code with errors in the script tag, i get errors in the console
[15:29:34] <jmole> wtf
[15:29:57] <mod> ?
[15:30:13] <mod> what errors?
[15:30:24] <miket3> can someone tell me what I am missing here?  alert($("[aria-controls='ordertemplate']").val()
[15:30:42] <mod> miket3, ending )
[15:31:06] <jmole> I mean if i put some statement in the script tag like "fuck()", the javascript console tells me that fuck is undefined. however the working code I have in the tag doesn't seem like it's being executed.
[15:31:18] <jmole> but when i paste the working code in the javascript console, it works.
[15:31:24] <miket3> mod,  no   i have that    it not findin the right control
[15:31:30] <mod> jmole, is it in a $(document).ready({...}) ?
[15:31:51] <jmole> mod: ahh..
[15:31:55] <mod> miket3, what you pasted is bad syntax... *shrug*
[15:31:57] <jmole> mod:thanks, it's been a while
[15:32:03] <mod> jmolr, np :)
[15:32:06] <mod> er jmole
[15:32:07] <mod> yw
[15:32:21] <miket3> alert($("[aria-controls='ordertemplate']").val());
[15:32:37] <mod> miket3, looks good
[15:32:45] <mod> oh heh
[15:32:49] <mod> try putting in a tag
[15:32:55] <miket3> i am using this on datatables  and it is returning the wrong control
[15:33:05] <mod> $('div[aria-controls='ordertemplate']')
[15:33:13] <mod> er
[15:33:16] <miket3> ok
[15:33:22] <mod> we do the opposite quoting
[15:33:23] <mod> here
[15:33:34] <mod> $("sometag[[aria-controls='ordertemplate']").val()
[15:33:45] <mod> where sometag is div, table, h3, etc
[15:34:50] <miket3> mod, thanks.... that helped  i added input
[15:37:47] <mod> miket3, yw
[15:38:16] <miket3> mod, one more thing   i set the value but it doesnt execute.. do you know how i can tell it to execute?
[15:38:32] <mod> dunno what "it" is
[15:38:45] <miket3> mod, aria-controls
[15:38:58] <mod> Anyone know why the most of these options dont seem to get applied?  http://pastebin.com/ZKhD62kJ
[15:39:09] <mod> miket3, no idea what aria-controls are
[15:39:43] <mod> i take it that the phrase "aria-controls" is an attribute on some tag?
[15:40:12] <miket3> mod, its actually an internet rich interface in the DOM
[15:41:16] <mod> miket3, yeah that went over my head too
[16:09:32] <newnicky> hi
[16:09:42] <Lobster> ARGH JQUERY WHY U DO THIS?
[16:09:52] <Lobster> (ni newnicky)
[16:09:54] <Lobster> hi*
[16:10:37] <Lobster> when you animate margin, it animates 1 pixel of 1 side at a time :/
[16:11:03] <Lobster> that's horrible behaviour
[16:11:08] <blindMoe> what does your $.animate call look like?
[16:11:18] <blindMoe> are you just doing 'margin' as a whole?
[16:11:20] <Lobster> http://jsfiddle.net/GGKyz/25/
[16:11:21] <Lobster> yeah
[16:11:24] <Lobster> margin as a whole
[16:11:49] <blindMoe> can't even tell it is doing it :)
[16:12:07] <blindMoe> it pretty much has to do it that way though doesn't it?
[16:12:07] <Lobster> chrome, right?
[16:12:11] <blindMoe> yeap
[16:12:20] <Lobster> ok actually it's broken in firefox right now
[16:12:45] <blindMoe> oh yeah it sucks in FF
[16:13:11] <Lobster> the only reason it works for chrome is because of some funky way that it processes 4 pixel values in one with parseInt
[16:13:24] <petermcandrew> spot
[16:13:28] <Lobster> but I never wrote that code expecting it to change one edge at a time
[16:13:31] <newnicky> hi
[16:13:38] <Lobster> hi newnicky
[16:14:06] <Lobster> gah that's the first thing that's really pissed me off about jquery
[16:14:15] <newnicky> im trying to get all elements starting with a certain text and split by space do something for each item i found
[16:14:19] <newnicky> how do i do that?
[16:17:38] <newnicky> hi hi
[16:17:42] <newnicky> is this gonna work?
[16:17:43] <newnicky> var configids = $("[id^=titleCheckbox]").split(' ');         alert(configids[0][0]);
[16:18:15] <Whirl3d> $.map @ newnicky
[16:18:40] <Whirl3d> bot-t hast thou forsaken us? rough
[16:18:59] <newnicky> ok
[16:19:01] <newnicky> i look it up
[16:19:17] <Whirl3d> http:.//api.jquery.com/map
[16:20:33] <newnicky> can i add a click event for each item in the map?
[16:20:36] <zim> Hi all. got a question re .data well probably a for question how do I ... http://jsfiddle.net/e9AMa/3/ the rest of the question here
[16:20:49] <Whirl3d> you can do whatever you want in the map callback
[16:21:12] <MysterOnyx> I know I can do this: $("#id").html("new text"). However, is there a way to add to the html without overwriting what was already there?
[16:21:41] <Eviltwin> $("[id^=titleCheckbox]").click(function() { /* this is called any time the checkboxes you selected before are clicked */})
[16:22:08] <newnicky> how do i get the ids of each item in the map and do a split
[16:22:45] <Eviltwin> Why do you want to do that?
[16:23:15] <RealityBall> MysterOnyx: learn how to append
[16:23:30] <zim> I have updated my question so it is a little clearer here http://jsfiddle.net/e9AMa/4/
[16:23:49] <MysterOnyx> reality I tried to append, but obviously I don't know how. I'm guessing it's not .html.append()
[16:23:52] <newnicky> casue i have a ton of checkboxs on a page and when i click on one of the checkboxes it has to disable a textbox
[16:24:06] <newnicky> how do i get the second element of a split
[16:24:14] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ newnicky
[16:24:14] <bot-t> newnicky, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)

[16:24:59] <catcherdev> Is the BBQ plugin the best way to manage multiple values in a hash tag?
[16:27:50] <Eviltwin> coldhead: I think BBQ is overpowered if all you're trying to do is change values in the hash
[16:28:09] <coldhead> ?csb @ Eviltwin
[16:28:09] <bot-t> Eviltwin, cool story, bro. http://i599.photobucket.com/albums/tt71/Pittsburghistan/xb9yt0jpg-1.gif
[16:28:52] <Eviltwin> s/coldhead/catcherdev/
[16:29:09] <zim> if anyone could have a look at my Q it would be great http://jsfiddle.net/e9AMa/4/ Thanks
[16:29:50] <coldhead> :D
[16:29:59] <catcherdev> Eviltwin, regexes?
[16:30:14] <Eviltwin> zim: You confused yourself
[16:30:15] <Eviltwin> zim: http://jsfiddle.net/e9AMa/5/
[16:30:28] <Eviltwin> catcherdev: Are you using query param style?
[16:31:40] <catcherdev> Eviltwin, it's my first foray, undecided.  Probably though.
[16:31:52] <zim> Eviltwin: Many thanks. is there a better way to do that?
[16:32:02] <Eviltwin> zim: Not use alert :D
[16:32:30] <zim> alert was just for the example
[16:34:00] <zim> Eviltwin: what I was trying to say is there a better way to do something with each data pair
[16:34:05] <Eviltwin> catcherdev: Query params are pretty easy to parse and unparse
[16:34:15] <Eviltwin> zim: That's the fastest way
[16:34:29] <zim> Thanks
[16:34:36] <Eviltwin> catcherdev: To parse you start by calling .split("&") on the string
[16:34:38] <coldhead> great work team
[16:34:48] <Eviltwin> And for each of those you .split("=")
[16:35:11] <Eviltwin> Then decodeURIComponent both pieces
[16:35:15] <Eviltwin> And that's your key and value
[16:35:28] <newnicky> is there something wrong with the syntax for this selector
[16:35:29] <newnicky> $("#titleCheckbox " + configid)
[16:36:29] <Eviltwin> To join back you just loop over all the keys and values calling encodeURIComponent on them and using key + "=" + value
[16:36:34] <Eviltwin> Then joining them together with "&"
[16:36:35] <catcherdev> Eviltwin, cool - so I wouldn't need the ? in that case, right? url/#&param1=val1&param2=val2
[16:37:08] <Eviltwin> I suggest always keeping the keys sorted
[16:37:12] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[16:37:14] <Eviltwin> Just like that
[16:37:16] <catcherdev> since they're in the hash? They're basically for my interpreter's use only.
[16:37:27] <Eviltwin> newnicky: Does configid start with "#"?
[16:38:13] <newnicky> no
[16:38:17] <newnicky> its a var
[16:38:32] <newnicky> var configid = $(this).attr('id').split(' ')[1];
[16:38:33] <Eviltwin> var configid = "#foobar";
[16:38:34] <Eviltwin> Hey look
[16:38:36] <Eviltwin> It's a var
[16:38:39] <Eviltwin> And it starts with a "#"

[16:38:48] <catcherdev> newnicky, in the DOM, is it an ID?
[16:38:50] <ShaunR> is there anyway to serialize two forms together?
[16:39:13] <catcherdev> thanks for the tips Eviltwin
[16:39:18] <newnicky> is configid an ID?
[16:39:51] <Eviltwin> newnicky: Dude, I think you need to learn JavaScript
[16:39:56] <Eviltwin> And how the DOM works
[16:43:10] <newnicky> configid comes out with a number
[16:43:18] <Eviltwin> newnicky: Dude, I think you need to learn JavaScript
[16:43:19] <Eviltwin> And how the DOM works
[16:43:24] <newnicky> $('#titleTextbox ' + configid)
[16:43:37] <newnicky> how come this selector doesnt pick it up
[16:43:41] <catcherdev> newnicky, what is configid supposed to refer to?
[16:43:45] <catcherdev> in the DOM?
[16:44:20] <newnicky> well each textbox has an id like id='titleTextbox 10030'
[16:44:29] <newnicky> id='titleTextbox 10040'
[16:44:39] <newnicky> and so in each map()  i need to add a click event
[16:44:57] <newnicky> cause there is a checkbox for each textbox
[16:45:04] <catcherdev> newnicky, spaces aren't valid in an ID.
[16:45:15] <newnicky> then what should i split against?
[16:45:26] <newnicky> should i put -
[16:45:31] <newnicky> as the delimiter?
[16:45:46] <catcherdev> Why do you need a delimiter?
[16:46:13] <newnicky> cause im using split
[16:46:21] <catcherdev> newnicky, if you're just trying to chuck data around, you should use .data()
[16:46:33] <newnicky> im not
[16:46:41] <newnicky> im tryin to add a click event to each checkbox
[16:46:58] <newnicky> to disable the textboxes that goes with each checkbox
[16:47:11] <catcherdev> newnicky, then why not add a second id?
[16:47:24] <newnicky> cause there are hundreds
[16:47:33] <newnicky> and i want jquery to automatically go down the page
[16:47:36] <newnicky> split the name
[16:47:40] <newnicky> get the id
[16:47:47] <newnicky> and add it to the right checkbox
[16:47:54] <newnicky> the event to disable the right textbox
[16:48:33] <catcherdev> newnicky, first, if many of them use titleTextbox, it should probably be a class.
[16:48:33] <Mr_Grim> hey has anyone had problems with jquery ui tools on mobile devices? I have issues with .scrollable where the touch events on a mobile device activate the scroll
[16:48:48] <catcherdev> newnicky, and then the configid, if it's unique, should be the ID.
[16:49:06] <newnicky> no
[16:49:11] <newnicky> cause there are more than one
[16:49:14] <newnicky> checkbox
[16:49:20] <newnicky> titlecheckbox10030
[16:49:25] <newnicky> and requirecheckbox10030
[16:49:39] <newnicky> and titletextbox and requiredtextbox too
[16:49:40] <catcherdev> newnicky, that's fine too, without the spaces
[16:49:52] <newnicky> but how am i suppsose to split that
[16:50:01] <catcherdev> You don't need to split, that's what selectors are for.
[16:50:20] <catcherdev> If the elements are set up right in the DOM.
[16:50:28] <catcherdev> for example, using .data()
[16:59:30] <miket3> i am having trouble appending html to a div that doesnt exist yet......  I beleive delegate  is the answer but i am having trouble setting it up... http://pastebin.com/fMXbuhfX
[17:02:02] <astropirate> miket3, give  .live() a wack
[17:16:08] <tpih> how would I make a div go to the bottom?
[17:16:18] <tpih> I have googled around but can't find anything
[17:16:19] <alexr2> the bottom of what?
[17:16:20] <tpih> useful
[17:16:29] <tpih> the bottom of a div the scrollbard
[17:16:33] <tpih> scrollbar*
[17:17:07] <alexr2> ?appendTo@tpih
[17:17:08] <bot-t> tpih, .appendTo(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the end of the target. http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[17:19:41] <Mr_Grim> is there a chanel for jquery ui tools?
[17:23:10] <Lobster> Mr_Grim: ui is an official extension so I think you're fine asking here
[17:23:36] <Mr_Grim> okay
[17:23:39] <Lobster> oh, it's in the topic and everything :)
[17:24:08] <Mr_Grim> so if you goto jquerytools.org on an iPhone or android phone. i cant scroll down to the bottom of the page. the swipe gesture keeps activating the scrolling.
[17:24:28] <Mr_Grim> i am wondering if its possible to disable the swipe gesture from preventing the scrolling to happen
[17:24:53] <Mr_Grim> im using scrollable in my page and as soon someone taps a form i have setup it auto scrolls over to the next part
[17:25:32] <Mr_Grim> try it yourself
[17:28:38] <Lobster> (I'm getting there... my android phone's connection is awful)
[17:29:36] <Lobster> I see...
[17:29:58] <Mr_Grim> Lobster yeah
[17:30:02] <Mr_Grim> is that a bug?
[17:31:09] <Lobster> what I don't understand though is that in windows it's not responding to any kind of scroll command at all
[17:31:36] <Lobster> the only way I can switch panels is by clicking
[17:32:49] <Lobster> ah ok, it works with keyboard arrows too
[17:34:54] <Lobster> personally I think it's crappy semantics
[17:35:29] <Lobster> it isn't a behaviour that should be expected of a scroll command under any circumstances
[17:36:10] <Lobster> not familiar enough with jquery ui to suggest a fix, but I doubt it's easy because scroll means scroll
[17:37:30] <Lobster> touchscreens still get the whole page, they just have to scroll through all the panels because the page has told the browser it's all one big page
[17:39:06] <Mr_Grim> or how do i prevent the mouse wheel
[17:39:09] <Mr_Grim> thats probably what is happening
[17:43:28] <sente> does anyone know of a good file-tree widget/package/whatever such which has behavior like http://c.sente.cc/1CFc/dirtree.png *BUT* doesn't require the whole tree to exist as json at load, the tree is far too big so I will have to build it out by requesting subdir data from the server
[17:43:41] <Mr_Grim> i got it to work
[17:43:42] <Mr_Grim> AWESOME
[17:45:31] <catcher> Need to fire off an event based on changes to an input box, character by character. Is keyup() the best tool for the job?
[17:46:00] <catcher> or .on("keyup" rather?
[17:47:49] <Lobster> Mr_Grim: what did you do in the end?
[17:48:41] <Lobster> catcher: .change()
[17:49:05] <catcher> Thanks Lobster
[17:49:10] <Lobster> assuming you want the event to fire in other changes to the value like a mouse paste
[17:49:23] <catcher> Lobster, sure do, glad I asked.
[17:52:41] <catcher> Lobster, is 'change' an event I can use with .on()?
[17:52:52] <catcher> Lobster, I need it to be delegated..
[17:53:19] <Lobster> catcher: yes, .change() is just a shorthand for it
[17:53:34] <catcher> Lobster, kk, must be a prob with my selector.
[17:58:04] <catcher> Lobster, does my input form need a name/type? I can bind a click handler with just an ID, and keyup, but not change.
[17:59:28] <Lobster> I don't think the user-agent should mind... I can't recall if it's technically valid html
[18:04:30] <catcher> Lobster, I'm reading somewhere that change doesn't bubble, and was removed from the list of supported events. Hrm.
[18:04:59] <Lobster> aw :/ sorry
[18:05:33] <johnkpaul> catcher: jQuery fakes the bubbling
[18:05:39] <johnkpaul> http://api.jquery.com/live/#typefn
[18:05:50] <johnkpaul> search for the word change
[18:06:16] <catcher> johnkpaul, any idea why .on("keyup" would work okay but .on("change" isn't?
[18:06:42] <catcher> johnkpaul, that's .live() rather than .on(), which is deprecated..
[18:06:57] <johnkpaul> catcher: live uses .on() under the hoods
[18:06:59] <johnkpaul> hood*
[18:07:06] <johnkpaul> also, change only happens when the element loses focus
[18:07:20] <johnkpaul> ?change @catcher
[18:07:20] <bot-t> catcher, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[18:07:28] <johnkpaul> read the paragraph under the method signatures
[18:09:33] <catcher> johnkpaul, interesting, so this case is an exclusion to the rule of using .on() instead of .live()?
[18:09:55] <johnkpaul> what do you mean? you should still use on
[18:10:05] <johnkpaul> live delegates directly to on
[18:10:38] <johnkpaul> catcher: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.fn.live
[18:11:09] <johnkpaul> I was just making two points 1) even though change doesn't really bubble, jquery fakes it
[18:11:38] <johnkpaul> 2) if keyup works, change should as well, but change doesn't happen every time a keyup happens, it only happens when the /input/textarea loses focus
[18:14:12] <catcher> johnkpaul, ahh, misunderstood, I see now.
[18:15:19] <catcher> Looks like keyup works on copy&paste too, that's probably my best bet.
[18:16:12] <johnkpaul> catcher: it might not from the edit context menu
[18:16:45] <johnkpaul> I don't know how much that matters
[18:17:13] <catcher> johnkpaul, any better choices than keyup for an input field that should update an ajax-loaded div based on their input?
[18:17:41] <catcher> I could do change with a fake 'update' button that would just steal focus..
[18:17:50] <johnkpaul> depends on what you mean by better
[18:18:09] <johnkpaul> if it really needs to handle every possible case of how someone could get text into a textarea, I'm pretty sure it's complicated
[18:18:12] <catcher> I'm digging option #2, fewer refreshes, would seem faster.
[18:18:15] <johnkpaul> you can check jquery-console and see how that's implemented
[18:48:15] <lyrae> how do i select Nth <li> in a ul. Theyre all hidden, and id like to show the Nth one.
[18:49:46] <alexr2> ?nth-child@lyrae
[18:49:47] <bot-t> lyrae, :nth-child(index/even/odd/equation): Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[18:51:23] <lyrae> alexr2: thank you
[18:51:56] <alexr2> no problem
[19:43:10] <pneftali> hrmm. why is that most social networks don't use ajax in their login process ?
[19:44:57] <letterpress> i imagine one reason is to ensure that the page is using https.
[20:00:32] <pneftali> letterpress: so it's for security ?
[20:03:27] <letterpress> yes that's what i would suspect.
[20:04:17] <zim> Hi all. How can I do ... var element = "foobar"; $('#'+foobar) that is blatantly wrong but hopefully you get the picture
[20:04:42] <zim> sorry var element = "foobar"; $('#'+element)
[20:04:59] <letterpress> i think that is fine, how you've written that zim.
[20:05:52] <zim> its not working :-\ will make sure there is no typos TY
[20:06:12] <shoky> derp
[20:06:16] <letterpress> you would be selecting an element with the id="foobar" in this example
[20:07:32] <zim> yes
[20:07:59] <letterpress> and is that id unique on the page?
[20:10:47] <zim> cracked it thanks was a typo somewhere else :-)
[20:10:59] <letterpress> :)
[20:12:50] <crowemi> #coldhead -- have you used underscore.js?!?
[20:14:01] <coldhead> yes, crowemi, yes i have
[20:14:10] <crowemi> http://jsfiddle.net/crowemi/hZr7E/ -- can you look at this?!?
[20:14:26] <crowemi> This is going back to our tempelate discussion the other night
[20:15:03] <crowemi> coldhead, standby
[20:15:08] <coldhead> i don't see what "compiled" is
[20:15:29] <crowemi> yeah
[20:15:37] <crowemi> Lol, I just saw that, but I still don't think it will work
[20:15:40] <crowemi> let me test
[20:16:22] <coldhead> this is how i used it last, crowemi: https://github.com/coldhead/conversational-latin/blob/master/app/conversational-latin.js#L82
[20:17:21] <crowemi> Thank you
[20:17:32] <crowemi> I will take a look!
[20:18:39] <crowemi> You're pretty advanced, lol
[20:19:11] <coldhead> no, i just made it look that way
[20:19:19] <coldhead> i don;'t understnad it either
[20:19:26] <crowemi> Lol
[20:19:47] <coldhead> this is a pretty good clear explanation http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4778881/how-to-use-underscore-js-as-a-template-engine
[20:19:57] <crowemi> Nice
[20:19:59] <crowemi> Thank you!
[20:31:16] <thinkerbell> $('html').scrollTop(0); I tried this, but it isn't scrolling the page to the top as I'd expect
[20:34:46] <ShaunR> thinkerbell: did you try $(html).scrollTop();
[20:36:04] <thinkerbell> ShaunR, ok, let me see, thanks
[20:36:15] <adamS> Howdy everybody
[20:36:36] <adamS> I'm a bit of a nub, when it comes to jquery.
[20:37:36] <thinkerbell> hmmm, it doesn't work with out the quotes either
[20:37:43] <thinkerbell> ShaunR, no luck, thx though
[20:37:56] <ShaunR> na, you need the quotes, just try removing the 0
[20:39:10] <adamS> Trying to master how this $each thing works. Seems nothing is happening on page load. my file is ultra short if anyone cares to peek :) http://pastebin.com/b0vqYCWu
[20:44:45] <letterpress> adamS so do you get a successful response from the server for this ajax request?
[20:46:49] <adamS> Nope, it doesn't seem to be executing the script at all
[20:47:07] <letterpress> does your page also share http://localhost:8080/ in the url? just checking if this is a same origin policy issue.
[20:47:23] <adamS> Yep
[20:47:53] <adamS> I think I have the get syntaxually correct
[20:48:01] <zCoder> Hey guys.. noob here.
[20:48:03] <adamS> but this is my first try with jquery
[20:48:11] <adamS> hi zcoder
[20:48:12] <zCoder> .length counts elements?
[20:48:20] <adamS> zCoder yea
[20:48:23] <zCoder> why did i also see people use it for strings
[20:48:26] <zCoder> to get count
[20:48:31] <zCoder> or i saw wrong
[20:49:01] <letterpress> i'm assuming that the jquery code is between script tags, or else in listcats.js or something, right?
[20:49:13] <adamS> zCoder: I'm a noob too. not sure why you saw that, but it does count elements
[20:49:26] <zCoder> ok thanks
[20:49:26] <adamS> yes, its in its own file
[20:49:32] <letterpress> ok just checking
[20:50:10] <letterpress> what isn't executing? the whole document ready function? or just the getjson?
[20:50:44] <thinkerbell> man, what would life be without jquery, garbage I tell you garbage, jquery is soo much better, they should just include it with all browsers now, I mean who the heck would code in javascript if they could code in jquery
[20:51:16] <adamS> letterpress I think the whole document ready function isn't executing. not sure why
[20:51:35] <letterpress> do you know about the javascript console, for debugging?
[20:51:50] <thinkerbell> and these plugins, am I right, they just blew Flash out of the market eh, I mean flash is dead, these plugins, thats basically html5 eh, is it true?
[20:51:53] <letterpress> there are often error messages there which will point you in the right direction
[20:51:58] <adamS> I have firebug for firefox
[20:52:07] <letterpress> ok. anything of note there?
[20:52:13] <thinkerbell> chrome has a nice console too, built in by default
[20:52:30] <letterpress> can you console.log('hi there'); inside your document ready to find out for sure?
[20:52:59] <adamS> Let me try that lol
[20:53:52] <letterpress> so you can set different console log messages throughout your code, to determine what's firing when, and what the values of each of your variables are along the way.
[20:54:00] <adamS> ok I did notice something in the console
[20:54:26] <adamS> it says there is an error: $ is not defined
[20:54:37] <letterpress> you need to link to jquery then
[20:54:57] <letterpress> you don't have jquery loaded. which is true in the code you posted.
[20:55:09] <letterpress> oops, i see it
[20:55:21] <adamS> hmm
[20:55:33] <letterpress> oh duh
[20:55:42] <adamS> Maybe the link i have is a bad one
[20:55:43] <letterpress> put the listcats.js below the jquery link
[20:55:57] <letterpress> you're firing the document ready before you load jquery
[20:56:25] <letterpress> also, it's good practice to put both of these script tags just inside the closing </body> tag
[20:57:39] <adamS> ah ok!
[20:58:00] <adamS> Now the document ready function is actually working :
[20:58:03] <adamS> :)
[20:58:07] <letterpress> :)
[21:08:03] <zCoder> why if im referancing  lets say all submit buttons i have to do $(':submit')
[21:08:05] <zCoder> why :
[21:08:06] <zCoder> ?
[21:13:38] <shoky> because that's the pseudo-selector for selecting submit buttons
[21:13:57] <shoky> without the : it'd search for <submit> tags
[21:14:45] <zCoder> thanks :)
[21:15:38] <zCoder> so basically it applies to html type="" things?
[21:16:24] <shoky> not just that, other things too
[21:16:36] <shoky> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[21:20:45] <Whirl3d> lol@thinkerbell. jquery _is_ javascript.
[21:21:57] <eddiemonge> it is?
[21:24:05] <Whirl3d> well, that and a wee-smidgin of magic, but yup
[21:25:10] <adamS> $("#tab").html("<table border='1'><form id='maint' action=''><tbody align='center'>"); - does that look correct if tab is a div id?
[21:25:50] <raj> yes
[21:26:04] <adamS> I thought so
[21:26:20] <Whirl3d> adamS, you need to use valid html. where are your table closing and form closing tags?
[21:26:28] <zCoder> so  $('selector').css() overwrites the current css values for the duration ?
[21:26:33] <raj> good call Whirl3d
[21:26:34] <Whirl3d> and tbody closing tage
[21:27:15] <adamS> Whirl3d: They are appended further down in the script. I run a loop in the middle to build a table.
[21:27:16] <Whirl3d> zCoder, it overwrites the css properties for the element. It doesn't change the attr or the css style
[21:27:27] <raj> zCoder, you put a property argument in .css() to get the value of that property
[21:27:42] <raj> if you have two arguments, the first is the property, and the second sets the value of that property
[21:28:00] <zCoder> oh
[21:28:05] <zCoder> so it works with one argument too?
[21:28:09] <zCoder> just to return the value?
[21:28:14] <Whirl3d> You have to provide valid html to $() or it won't work. $("hello<a>world</a>this is a test") will only recognize <a>world</a>
[21:28:15] <raj> to return the value
[21:28:16] <raj> yes
[21:28:18] <zCoder> nice
[21:28:19] <zCoder> thanks
[21:28:44] <eddiemonge> zCoder: it might help to read the see ? getting started
[21:28:45] <bot-t> zCoder, Tutorials:Getting Started with jQuery - Goes through the basics of jQuery, all the way up to building plugins. http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[21:28:57] <zCoder> ok
[21:29:01] <raj> more specifically http://api.jquery.com/css/
[21:29:05] <raj> the docs are really pretty good
[21:29:11] <zCoder> thanks
[21:29:13] <raj> some of the best i've seen for any library
[21:29:16] <Whirl3d> so, you would be wise to approach a table from one of two directions...either compile the string for the table in its entirety and the $(somestring).appendTo(something);
[21:29:38] <Whirl3d> or build your table as one command and then append the pieces as you build them.
[21:30:38] <Whirl3d> $("<table></table>").appendTo(something);   $("<tbody>something</tbod>").appendTo($("table"));
[21:30:46] <eddiemonge> adamS: are you sure you want to be using a table in the first place? and border and align arent really valid anymore
[21:31:46] <lyrae> I am selecting all divs inside an element. But it also seems to be selecting all those divs' inner divs. How can i just select the outermost divs? i've tried + and ~
[21:31:49] <lyrae> but no go
[21:32:11] <Whirl3d> $(element).children("div");
[21:32:48] <ddoom> Can I ask questions about jquery-ui here?
[21:32:56] <lyrae> Whirl3d: thanks
[21:33:13] <Whirl3d> np
[21:33:39] <adamS> Whirl3d: all good advice! Perhaps i should append everything to a string and then use that
[21:35:08] <Whirl3d> Appending things to the dom is a costly (time) procedure. Often it's best to compile an html string and append it once. But like eddiemonge said, tables aren't really used much anymore: if avoidable, you probably should avoid them
[21:35:59] <Whirl3d> *I meant aren't used much for layout purposes...tabular data is another thing.
[21:36:00] <ddoom> I'm using autocomplete from jquery-ui. is it possible to not show the possible results until you push enter or some other event?
[21:36:52] <Whirl3d> why would you want the autocomplete options to appear after you pressed enter? Seems kinda like it misses the point
[21:38:05] <ddoom> Whirl3d: mobile, keyboard is above the options among other things
[21:38:06] <eddiemonge> you mean it seems backwards?
[21:38:31] <eddiemonge> ddoom: if you are on mobile you should be looking at mobile solutions, not large screen solutions
[21:39:09] <eddiemonge> an alternative would be to scroll the autocomplete to the top of the screen on focus
[21:40:24] <Whirl3d> doom, I see what you are trying to accomplish. Perhaps you don't necessarily want autocomplete, but rather a custom solution that filters results on text input and dynamically builds a menu that matches.
[21:42:43] <ddoom> Whirl3d: indeed, the jqui autocomplete is very close to what I want. I guess I'll have to do it custom
[21:43:03] <eddiemonge> ddoom: did you see my suggestion?
[21:44:06] <ddoom> eddiemonge: not sure I understand it, the textbox the autocomplete is attached to is close to the top of the page anyway
[21:44:48] <eddiemonge> make it go to the top of the screen, limit the results to something smaller like 5 and it shouldnt get too covered by the keyboard
[21:45:09] <eddiemonge> but like i said, you should be using a mobile solution for mobile based devices
[22:03:06] <markq> I don't quite understand when to do something directly in css or when I should just draw the line and script the behavior that I want in JS
[22:05:19] <beancurd> markq: do as much presentation in css, leave behaviors to js.
[22:06:34] <coldhead> beancurd++
[22:06:51] <markq> for example something like this: http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_transition.asp
[22:07:10] <markq> CSS3 is more widely supported in modern browsers than JS is enabled right?
[22:07:13] <markq> or no
[22:07:14] <markq> ?
[22:07:41] <beancurd> js is more widely enabled.
[22:07:45] <coldhead> i'd expect the reverse, yeah
[22:07:50] <coldhead> but people without js hate life
[22:07:55] <coldhead> and deserve everything they get
[22:07:58] <coldhead> show them no mercy
[22:08:08] <coldhead> they're probably not even on facebook
[22:08:24] <markq> so wouldn't I be running a risk if I did the transition strictly in css?
[22:08:25] <beancurd> if you're really wary of people having js disabled then you can have fallback css transitions..
[22:08:42] <markq> since the transition is a css3 thing
[22:10:42] <Whirl3d> So do your transition in css3 if possible and fallback to js when not
[22:10:55] <markq> how do I code that?
[22:11:00] <coldhead> very carefully
[22:11:06] <Whirl3d> and if neither are available, screw em
[22:12:10] <markq> I already plan to not support clients that don't have js. so I would have to do some sort of check in js that checks if the browser supports css3?
[22:12:37] <Whirl3d> I think you use media queries, but I haven't done it yet
[22:13:26] <markq> actually, does jquery automatically check to see if the client supports css3 and then simply invokes a css3 action on the element and if it doesnt have css3 then it defaults to it's internal js mechanisms?
[22:13:42] <markq> that's my guess as to how jquery does it
[22:13:47] <markq> but i may be wrong
[22:14:03] <Whirl3d> not that I am aware of. There are libraries that do it. Like transit.js
[22:15:07] <markq> it would actually make sense if jquery implemented something like that since I'm certain that css3 is more efficient than js doing the same thing manually
[22:16:29] <Whirl3d> that's why I like transit.js. It optimizes css3 transitions to use hardware acceleration on ios devices, for example.
[22:17:03] <coldhead> well said
[22:19:30] <eTiger13> css3 isnt always more efficient
[22:20:52] <coldhead> its more efficient for the minds of poor developers
[22:21:20] <Whirl3d> do you have a reference link that supports/clarifies that CSS3 is not always more effecient. I believe you, but would like to see some tests
[22:21:37] <markq> that was another guess basically
[22:21:56] <markq> I honestly don't know how css3 interacts with the dom in the back end
[22:22:04] <markq> it's almost like magic
[22:22:14] <markq> js makes sense though
[22:22:29] <markq> because I can physically see it doing stuff to the dom
[22:22:54] <markq> that was really vague lol
[22:23:51] <coldhead> css should have no effect on the dom
[22:23:52] <Whirl3d> I like the altnernate syntax for animate....I like $(something).animate(somedestcss, someway) where someway is contains the duration, easing, complete and step callbacks)
[22:23:56] <coldhead> they should be separate layers
[22:25:28] <markq> actually, how does css work?
[22:25:31] <coldhead> like a woans love
[22:25:34] <coldhead> womans*
[22:25:43] <markq> :P
[22:26:05] <coldhead> what do you mean?
[22:26:12] <coldhead> you get how its a way to style content
[22:26:18] <coldhead> to separate the style and the content
[22:26:18] <coldhead> right?
[22:26:35] <coldhead> cssgarden and all that

[22:35:12] <adamS> Hello again guys
[22:35:24] <webguytim> sup
[22:35:49] <adamS> Thanks for all the help! I finally have everything working except for just one thing! I've posted at http://pastebin.com/FPTWNTpy
[22:36:12] <adamS> $("#tab").append(htstring); seems to not put my string into the div tag
[22:36:34] <adamS> i tried $("#tab")html(htstring); also
[22:37:09] <webguytim> did you include a '.'?
[22:37:23] <webguytim> $("#tab").html(htstring);
[22:37:23] <Cork> adamS: net work trafic is async
[22:37:30] <Cork> you can't do anything after it
[22:37:37] <adamS> yessir, it was a typo
[22:37:49] <Cork> adamS: append needs to move into the append into the callback
[22:38:12] <Cork> (line 10-11)
[22:38:29] <Cork> uh... *append needs to move into the callback
[22:38:49] <Hereisanotherlie> on a js fiddle do you have to put in <script></script>
[22:38:59] <Cork> no
[22:39:06] <eTiger13> htstring= htstring +     ===     htstring +=
[22:39:07] <Cork> ues the script section instead
[22:39:08] <Hereisanotherlie> thanks cork
[22:39:24] <adamS> Thank you!
[22:39:36] <adamS> Cork! you da man!
[22:39:49] <eTiger13> and a normal for loop there would be better than a $.each
[22:39:58] <Cork> adamS: the way your code worked, you appended the string without whats in the json
[22:40:22] <Cork> as the callback runs after the outer function ends, or posibly even later
[22:40:55] <Cork> but its garanteed to not run before that
[22:42:50] <adamS> works now
[22:42:56] <adamS> moved itlike you suggested
[22:43:11] <adamS> perfecto! This is my first jquery script so i'm very happy
[22:43:44] <Cork> adamS: welcome to the dark side then ;P
[22:44:08] <tw2113> the dark side: we have cookies and iphones
[22:44:15] <webguytim> adamS: it's awesome you came here (so early).. the googles are not nearly as personal ;)
[22:44:55] <Whirl3d> ...or dark
[22:52:25] <Whirl3d> Is it bad form, when writing a plugin, to have a local (private?) function named similar to your $.fn method. In other words if I extend jquery's fn object using $.fn.group = function () { function group() { do stuff}}; is it bad form?
[22:56:37] <Cork> Whirl3d: its up to you, it won't conflict with anything as its completly local to your plugin, and sometimes its what makes the most sence
[22:56:49] <Cork> Whirl3d: but sometimes it can cause confusion
[22:57:28] <Whirl3d> got ya. Thanks for the reply. Have you written plugins before and if so, do you have a "model" or "template" around which you structure your plugins?
[22:58:40] <Whirl3d> It appears that there are a dozen different approaches and rather than continue flailing about trying to learn them all and figure out each of their pros and cons, I think it's best to pick one style and get it figured out...then move on if necessary
[22:58:49] <Cork> Whirl3d: what do you mean with model or template?
[22:59:41] <Whirl3d> Some folks like to create an object in their plugin and extend the object's prototype with functions, then bind the otherwise private functions to the elements, etc. Some people don't
[22:59:42] <Cork> and yes i've written several plugins both for jquery and ui
[23:00:29] <Cork> i usually have a public function through witch i access my features
[23:00:37] <Whirl3d> I'm asking you because I respect your answers and I like the way you think about things. I figured I could use your approach, figure it out and then if I wanted to try a different way, I would have a strong stable base to move on from
[23:00:38] <Cork> and i leave the rest on a private object
[23:01:16] <Hereisanotherlie> http://jsfiddle.net/5yLkU/1/
[23:01:22] <Whirl3d> so then you call the public function with a string to access the private functions?
[23:01:31] <Cork> yes
[23:01:32] <Hereisanotherlie> I kind of have it working but the fiddle is acting up
[23:01:44] <Whirl3d> like $(element).plugin("privatefunction", functionparams);
[23:01:56] * Cork nods
[23:01:59] <Hereisanotherlie> what I want to do is have my main content hide and display the relevant div depending on which image is being hovered
[23:02:29] <Hereisanotherlie> and on mouse leave I want the main content to show again and have the relevant div go back to hiding
[23:02:44] <ag4ve> i'm trying to recommend a nuts to bolts jquery tutorial to someone, any suggestions?
[23:03:06] <Hereisanotherlie> ag4ve: I have been doing this - http://tutsplus.com/course/30-days-to-learn-jquery/
[23:03:09] <Cork> Whirl3d: $.pub_func = function(command) { if(command[0] !== '_', PrivObj[command] !== undefined) { return PrivObj[command].apply(PrivObj, Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)); } };
[23:03:11] <ag4ve> i learned jquery by example and being given a web project and told 'learn quick' :)
[23:03:16] <Whirl3d> Great. and then the first thing you do in your plugin is check to see if your private object has a property provided by the first argument in the constructor. If so, then call that function with the rest of the arguments
[23:04:05] <ag4ve> Hereisanotherlie: hey videos :)
[23:04:19] <sente> http://jqfundamentals.com/
[23:04:24] <Hereisanotherlie> ag4ve: yeah they're nice :p, he's a good teacher too
[23:04:34] <Hereisanotherlie> he shows you why things work and why they don't
[23:04:44] <Whirl3d> aha! It's the array.prototype.slice....line that I was messing up. I was trying arguments.prototype.slice(1).....
[23:05:23] <ag4ve> you guys think someone trying to learn this stuff should start with firebug or node?
[23:05:36] <tw2113> firebug
[23:05:38] <Whirl3d> and why do you apply the private function to the private object rather than to this?
[23:05:40] <tw2113> node is a different world
[23:05:41] <ag4ve> my preference is of course node, but...
[23:05:47] <Hereisanotherlie> firebug / chrome developer
[23:05:49] <tw2113> and not jquery specific
[23:06:01] <ag4ve> right
[23:06:06] <Cork> Whirl3d: this is the public element
[23:06:24] <ag4ve> ok, i'll scrap the nodejs recommendation since this seems to be a consensis :)
[23:06:30] <Hereisanotherlie> anyone know what I should do for my problem? It is almost there but not quite
[23:06:46] <Hereisanotherlie> when I do the .mouseleave() all the content shows up again
[23:06:49] <Cork> Whirl3d: the structure is about the same as what jquery-ui uses
[23:07:06] <Cork> this._private_function()
[23:08:33] <Whirl3d> I noticed that you were extending jquery and not the jquery.fn function. Why is that?
[23:08:52] <Cork> its a function similar to $.ajax
[23:08:55] <Cork> it doens't work on an element
[23:08:59] <Cork> (in this case)
[23:09:10] <Cork> but the basics are the same
[23:10:01] <Whirl3d> Aha. See, what I could use is a use-case table. I am never sure when to use which style of plugin. In this case, since it isn't applied to an element, use ...... if applied to an element, try this way.....
[23:10:45] <Whirl3d> I know there are overlaps and all. And the meat and potatos are probably very similar, but the juicy bits are important as well.
[23:10:54] <Cork> Whirl3d: it really depends on how complex your plugin needs to be
[23:11:11] <Cork> most plugins doens't need more then the main function
[23:11:30] <Cork> (and some if/switch cases)
[23:12:28] <Whirl3d> See, I am trying to extend the relationship of elements and a logical parent (or group) item so that I can use methods like .nextItem to access the next item. But these elements may not be siblings in the dom.
[23:13:23] <Cork> it rather depends on how much code you need
[23:13:30] <Whirl3d> so, given a slideshow, for example, you would have the group of slides and their associated elements that may not be heirarchically related.
[23:14:00] <Cork> it would basically be a class selector right?
[23:15:38] <Whirl3d> sort of. Here is the thing I created earlier that I was hoping to encapsulate
[23:15:40] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/SxJaH/53/
[23:16:27] <Whirl3d> So basically, I could great a "group" object that could call nextItem, prevItem with no parameters and it would select the correct nextItem, prevItem, and "current" item
[23:16:59] <Whirl3d> it would basically store the class selectors and the methods to access them
[23:17:10] <Hereisanotherlie> http://jsfiddle.net/5yLkU/1/ pretty please with sugar on top
[23:19:00] <Cork> Whirl3d: hmm
[23:19:10] <boblet> in jQueryUI if youâ€™re using revert:invalid on draggable, how do you destroy droppable on an invalid drop? Iâ€™ve added $(myVar).droppable('destroy'); to drop and stop functions - it works fine if drop is successful, but doesnâ€™t clear droppable if drop fails. Halp?
[23:19:22] <Whirl3d> Hereisanotherlie, you aren't using jquery in that fiddle. does that help?
[23:19:28] <Cork> i would prob store the selector on the parent grouping element instead
[23:19:40] <Cork> to reduce the number of arguments you need to pass each time
[23:19:54] <Hereisanotherlie> Whirl3d: what do you mean?
[23:20:12] <Whirl3d> Hereisanotherlie, change the framework to jquery from moootools
[23:20:27] <ag4ve> is the jquery users mailing list still inactive / down?
[23:20:47] <Hereisanotherlie> oh lol thanks Whirl3d http://jsfiddle.net/5yLkU/2/
[23:21:34] <Whirl3d> Hereisanotherlie, are you using console to check for errors. That should be your first place to look
[23:22:21] <Whirl3d> the console clearly indicates that there is a problem with the line   this.on   you may have meant $(this).on
[23:22:38] <Hereisanotherlie> yeah I was playing around with that
[23:23:01] <Whirl3d> and I don't see any ".mainBlurb" items.
[23:23:03] <Hereisanotherlie> I thought it might be doing $($(this) ) but it wasn't
[23:24:01] <Hereisanotherlie> I wanted .mainBlurb to get added on the .mouseenter() and removed again on the mouseleave()
[23:24:06] <Whirl3d> and it probably is a good idea to put your mouseleave function in your original .on statement rahter than in the handler function for your mouseenter function
[23:27:53] <Hereisanotherlie> thanks that actually makes a lot of sense
[23:28:23] <Hereisanotherlie> this my first ever non copy the tutorial script
[23:28:26] <raj> I wanna show an edit link for a picture thumbnail only if the current logged in user matches .data('owner') of the file
[23:28:41] <raj> how can I get ahold of the current logged in user?
[23:28:48] <raj> will that require an extra ajax request?
[23:29:16] <Whirl3d> no problem. check this out (though it does nothing, it should give you the idea about how to move forward) I'll comment the source. gimme just a minute
[23:29:28] <Cork> raj: you don't have file access in javascript
[23:29:50] <raj> Cork, so what's the correct way to do this without a page refresh?
[23:29:54] <Cork> raj: so ya, if you want to know the info about a file you need to ask the server
[23:30:07] <raj> ok, so an ajax request
[23:30:13] <Cork> ya
[23:30:16] <raj> 1) can that be faked?
[23:30:26] <Cork> yes
[23:30:36] <raj> 1b) what's the protection against that?
[23:30:41] <raj> token?
[23:30:46] <Cork> make the check server side
[23:30:57] <Cork> and block access if you don't want to allow it
[23:31:19] <raj> right, so I'd have an ajax callback that adds the <a>edit this picture</a> link
[23:31:26] <raj> or else, doesn't
[23:31:26] <Cork> tocken is to see that it comes from someone with access to the html you produce
[23:31:55] <Cork> that can easily be faked too though (though it prevent most javascript based attacks)
[23:32:03] <Whirl3d> Hereisanotherlie, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5yLkU/6/
[23:32:15] <raj> ok, so basically I can't protect myself in showing that link
[23:32:19] <raj> only when the file is actually changed
[23:32:25] <raj> (serverside check)
[23:32:29] <Cork> yes
[23:32:33] <Cork> you can try to make a nice ui
[23:32:42] <Cork> but you can't protect your self
[23:32:48] <Cork> all protection has to be in the server code
[23:32:52] <raj> gotcha
[23:32:58] <raj> thanks Cork :)
[23:33:02] <Cork> np
[23:36:37] <raj> Cork, btw, where all in my code should I be using tokens?
[23:38:20] <Cork> raj: when you need to garantee that the caller has loaded the previus html page
[23:38:37] <Cork> thats all it garantees
[23:38:38] <raj> not sure what you mean
[23:38:54] <raj> anytime a user clicks a link?
[23:39:31] <Cork> tockens are to prevent things like other sites using forms posts to your site
[23:39:48] <raj> ok, so anytime there's a form post
[23:39:48] <Cork> anything that first can load your page and then do the post isn't affected
[23:40:08] <Cork> so it depends on what you need to secure your self agenst
[23:40:08] <raj> right, cuz they will have the token anyway
[23:40:13] <Cork> yes
[23:40:45] <raj> so when I render a page, where do I store the token?
[23:40:45] <Cork> you only need to care about it when you change data
[23:41:00] <raj> hidden?
[23:41:06] <raj> like a hidden form field
[23:41:07] <Cork> ya
[23:41:17] <raj> k
[23:41:20] <Cork> if your using ajax you can filter on that too
[23:41:20] <raj> do ajax posts count?
[23:41:29] <Cork> and skip the tocken
[23:41:31] <raj> filter on what?
[23:42:43] <Cork> X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
[23:43:02] <raj> i have no idea what that means
[23:43:09] <Cork> its a http header
[23:43:43] <Cork> and that would block other sites from posting to you cause they can't do ajax posts to third party domains
[23:43:43] <raj> so you're saying if I'm doing an ajax post, I should change the header?
[23:43:53] <Cork> its always changed
[23:43:59] <raj> oh, so I'm safe with ajax
[23:44:09] <Cork> if you check that header yes
[23:44:11] <raj> as long as I check
[23:44:12] <raj> k
[23:44:13] <raj> great
[23:44:17] <raj> thank you
[23:44:20] <Cork> np
[23:44:52] <Cork> additionally you can check the host header
[23:44:59] <Cork> to see what domain it came from
[23:45:29] <Cork> though like i said, this doesn't protect agenst things like wget or curl
[23:47:07] <raj> wget? I just use that to download files from the CL
[23:47:20] <raj> didn't know I could be a l33t hax0r with that
[23:48:01] <Cork> well you can't do posts (if i remember correctly) but you can set custom headers
[23:49:24] <Whirl3d> is there a problem with mouseleave events and .on?
[23:50:52] <raj> interesting
[23:51:44] <Hippie> Hey! Anyone here that can help me?
[23:52:02] <Cork> Whirl3d: depends what type of on your using
[23:52:17] <Cork> delegate type doesn't have leave enter
[23:52:26] <Cork> bind type does
[23:54:04] <Hereisanotherlie> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/5yLkU/17/ what do you think about this now, it's almost how I want it
[23:54:05] <Whirl3d> $(parentelement).on("mouseleave", function (e) {console.log($(e.target));}); acts weird. fires randomly
[23:54:19] <Hippie> Should this work? http://pastey.org/356y2
[23:54:20] <adamS> Hey folks, has anyone seen any really good tutorials for ajax with jquery?
[23:55:19] <Hereisanotherlie> there are two issues / the new content pops up before the mainBlurb completes its animation / if you move over the images quickly it is a little glitchy
[23:55:38] <raj> Cork, is there a normal place to save the current logged in user's userid, username, and permissions, so I don't have to attach it to each ajax callback
[23:55:43] <Cork> adamS: the doc page should explain it well enough if your familiar doing network calls in js
[23:56:01] <raj> I can just do it once when the page loads (I do my first ajax request when the page loads anyway)
[23:56:23] <Cork> raj: that sounds like something that shouldn't be controled in js
[23:56:32] <raj> what do you mean?
[23:56:44] <Hippie> ray, PHP $_SESSION[]
[23:56:46] <raj> I'll check against it serverside for any data coming it
[23:56:49] <raj> *coming in
[23:57:15] <Cork> and what checks that, that data is correct server side?
[23:57:19] <raj> but I want to be able to use that info to render particular elements in different ways
[23:57:30] <raj> Cork, my server would
[23:57:43] <raj> I'd make sure the logged in user has permission to do xyz
[23:57:52] <Cork> then no, have a varaible somewhere and store it there
[23:58:04] <raj> have a variable where?
[23:58:06] <raj> serverside?
[23:58:27] <Cork> no for showing client side
[23:58:31] <Hippie> Cork, can you check this for me? http://pastey.org/356y2
[23:58:45] <Xotix> hi
[23:58:46] <raj> Cork, I'm not sure what you mean
[23:58:56] <raj> store a variable serverside?
[23:59:00] <Cork> raj: what makes me a bit worrid is why would you want to send it from client side to server?
[23:59:02] <raj> or store a variable clientside?
[23:59:12] <raj> I don't
[23:59:33] <Cork> so just send it when you sends the list of files or what ever you send
[23:59:43] <Cork> stor it in the same jsonlike structure
[23:59:52] <raj> I only want the currently logged in user's username and permission (authenticated/unauthenticated/admin/etc) so I can render elements appropriately
