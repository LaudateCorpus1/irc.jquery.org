[13:24:23] <kof> Hi guys can i load jquery in this way and call the slider? view-source:https://coderblaze.com/jstest/
[20:19:40] <robertparkerx> I'm trying to make a four column select. I've seen code where it split by a char and add what look like spaces
[20:20:08] <robertparkerx> is it possible to add spaces between text ? And then actually add more to say two spaces to achieve the four column look
[20:20:33] <robertparkerx> or maybe add a char and replace it with spaces
[20:21:10] <robertparkerx> I can show their example http://jsfiddle.net/upgradellc/ASR2K/2
[20:29:13] <robertmaxrees> you mean you're trying to align the text within the select?
[20:29:35] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, replacing text is easyt.
[20:29:39] <robertmaxrees> *easy
[20:29:48] <robertparkerx> yes I think
[20:29:54] <robertparkerx> I'm really not sure robertmaxrees
[20:30:18] <robertmaxrees> so what do you mean by "four column select"??
[20:30:50] <robertparkerx> https://i.hashdev.org/20200712_193051_ROBERTPARKERX.jpg
[20:31:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so you're trying to align text between them.  that's going to be 1000x easier if you use some kind of replacement for selects.  are you using something like bootstrap already?
[20:31:45] <robertparkerx> Yes I am
[20:33:14] <robertmaxrees> then you'll want to experiment with that.  alternatively, it would make a lot more sents to present this using a table and radio buttons instead.
[20:33:46] <robertmaxrees> since right now you're cramming a lot of data into a small space.  might be confusing to end-users :)
[20:55:38] <robertparkerx> robertmaxrees what does / /g mean
[20:55:49] <robertparkerx> \u00a0 is nbsp;
[20:55:52] <robertmaxrees> that's a regular expression with the "global" flag.
[21:05:25] <robertparkerx> This one trick only works with Courier New font
[21:05:27] <robertparkerx> :(
[21:05:37] <robertmaxrees> *any monospaced font.
[21:05:40] <robertmaxrees> but yeah.
[21:07:16] <robertparkerx> Why
[21:08:07] <robertmaxrees> in non-monospaced fonts, each character can take up a variable about of width.  in monospaced fonts, each character is the same width.
[21:08:31] <robertparkerx> Ah makes sense
[21:08:31] <robertparkerx> ty
