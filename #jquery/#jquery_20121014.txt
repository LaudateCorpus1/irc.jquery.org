[00:20:03] <bluesnow> Hi, I'm wondering why the "success" callback function in AJAX requests can take either one or two arguments
[00:20:36] <astropirate> bluesnow, because it always has a default value of undefined
[00:20:55] <astropirate> ^^ it makes sense if you think of it that way if yo uare coming from a C++ java world
[00:21:27] <bluesnow> Sorry, I might have asked that wrong
[00:21:34] <bluesnow> It's the function I define and pass as the success parameter
[00:21:47] <bluesnow> ie, success: myfunction(json, status) { }
[00:22:05] <bluesnow> But I can also define it just as success: myfunction(json) {}
[00:22:35] <bluesnow> The docs seem to say that the success function I pass gets passed the json response, status text, and something else.
[00:22:43] <bluesnow> So why can I pass a function with just one argument?
[00:23:12] <bluesnow> I'm just wondering how that's coded
[00:23:43] <buu> Pretty sure javascript silently ignores extra arguments
[00:24:13] <bluesnow> Ah okay, thanks.
[00:24:22] <buu> I AM OMNIPRESENT
[00:24:25] <bluesnow> Lol
[00:25:08] <astropirate> :O
[00:25:24] * astropirate locks himself in his panic room
[00:25:34] <buu> I AM INSIDE THE HOUSE
[00:25:37] <buu> Also inside the panic room!
[00:25:41] <astropirate> NOOO

[01:10:39] <voila> hello every one ..
[01:12:31] <hyper_ch> Hi CrawfordComeaux
[01:12:45] <voila> I need help in jquery ... There is input box name : CITY (id="city") just below that a div "display"(hidden) , then below that "login button" ... when user enter a city .. i suggest him city by display it in div "display" .. i want to slide down "login button" when result being displayed ..
[01:13:55] <voila> how can i achieve it ?? when i m doing .. $("#display").slideDown() .... then it is not sliding down the login button
[01:19:22] <sjeijk> I assume #display the id of the div?
[01:20:06] <voila> yes
[01:20:06] <sjeijk> make a jsfiddle
[01:20:12] <voila> oh ok
[01:22:08] <voila> http://jsfiddle.net/RfBr8/
[01:22:17] <voila> sjeijk : can you please look a this
[01:30:47] <sjeijk> afaik put your css above the js
[01:30:52] <sjeijk> for starters
[01:31:44] <sjeijk> http://jsfiddle.net/RfBr8/4/ still errors
[01:32:22] <sjeijk> your ajax call is breaking your code
[01:32:31] <sjeijk> check console
[01:33:28] <voila> is it .. but when i m running it on my localhost .. then my suggestion.php is running fine and returning me results...
[01:34:02] <sjeijk> when i comment / delete some stuff seems to do something at least here http://jsfiddle.net/RfBr8/7/
[01:36:50] <voila> hey .. yes .. its sliding in jsfiddle .. so what is the problem .. i m newbie ..:) ..
[01:36:58] <sjeijk> me 2
[01:37:24] <sjeijk> maybe its your css file, try put it above your jscript
[01:39:58] <voila> lolzz .. ok .. i m keping it just below <head>
[01:50:21] <optraz> what function to check if a string exists ?
[01:51:46] <astropirate> optraz,    mystring !== undefined
[01:53:25] <brass> typeof var != 'undefined'
[01:55:25] <optraz> astropirate: brass no... i want to check a selected string exists in a longer string
[02:07:42] <sahbeewah> str.indexOf(searchString) !== -1
[02:10:02] <sayakb> i have this page with a delete button. the backend checks for the $_POST['button_name'] and then processes the delete action. i am trying to add a delete confirmation using twitter bootstrap modal - on click of the yes button on the modal, i am doing $('[name=button_name]').click() but nothing seems to happen. some way i can trigger the click event for the button?
[02:11:33] <sahbeewah> sayakb: that is correct, your problem is somewhere else
[02:12:13] <sayakb> sahbeewah: if i do $('[name=button_name]').remove() or something, it does indeed remove the correct button.
[02:12:37] <sayakb> button_name is unique on the page
[02:13:20] <BinaryKitten> sayakb you can also fire the event handler without the normal one.  but that's not what it seems you're doing. can you pastebin the handler for the click event?
[02:13:33] <sayakb> sure, sec
[02:14:14] <sayakb> http://paste.kde.org/568856/20604313/
[02:15:41] * BinaryKitten shudders at the global scope code ....
[02:16:30] <sayakb> heh well, the tool i'm working on is a dynamic site building app - so you can add this delete button control to your widgets - all delete buttons should ideally confirm data
[02:16:37] <sayakb> *confirm submission
[02:16:44] <BinaryKitten> sayakb is there any reason why you're storing the element on an attribute?
[02:16:59] <BinaryKitten> i mean the button's name
[02:17:47] <sayakb> BinaryKitten: the backens processes the delete action by checking $_POST['btn_name'] .. i store it so that i can click that specific button once i click yes on the modal
[02:18:09] <BinaryKitten> sayakb ok understand that.
[02:18:21] <BinaryKitten> but you don't need to look it up again
[02:18:34] <BinaryKitten> try using a reference variable, or .data
[02:18:59] <sayakb> ah right, thats .. er, better! let me try that once.
[02:19:17] <BinaryKitten> i'll update an example
[02:19:32] <sayakb> i should add update functionality to that pastebin some day
[02:21:10] <BinaryKitten> http://pastebin.com/wwD4RyWD
[02:21:33] <BinaryKitten> sayakb there are other improvements you can make as well
[02:21:43] <BinaryKitten> you shouldn't treat Javascript like PHP
[02:23:14] <BinaryKitten> also, sayakb you have a recursion issue
[02:23:30] <BinaryKitten> click the button, the dialog shows, that then clicks the button
[02:23:46] <sayakb> BinaryKitten: that change still doesnt click the button
[02:25:55] <sayakb> hm, strange, not a browser issue even, same problem on chrome, opera and ff
[02:26:05] <maloik> does the change event on a checkbox not get triggered when you programatically change the checked value ?
[02:27:42] <BinaryKitten> sayakb: http://pastebin.com/WNk6keDT
[02:27:54] <sahbeewah> maloik: no it doesn't
[02:28:07] <BinaryKitten> maloik usually change fires after blur
[02:29:03] <BinaryKitten> sayakb: oops sorry error on line 4 .. i missed the $
[02:29:32] <sayakb> BinaryKitten: woohoo, that works!
[02:29:42] <sayakb> thanks :)
[02:29:44] <BinaryKitten> sayakb do you understand that code?
[02:29:51] <saschagehlich> hey, does anybody know a jquery plugin that can increase a float inside an input by dragging up / down?
[02:30:19] <BinaryKitten> how do you mean "increase a float" ?
[02:30:32] <sayakb> BinaryKitten: yep
[02:30:38] <BinaryKitten> sayakb cool
[02:30:53] <saschagehlich> well there's a float value inside the text input, let's say 0.000. if i click inside the input an drag up, the number should be increased. if i drag down, it should get smaller
[02:31:00] <BinaryKitten> ah right
[02:31:13] <BinaryKitten> nothing i know saschagehlich
[02:31:16] <BinaryKitten> but
[02:31:29] <BinaryKitten> you could hook on the mouseup/down and move
[02:31:32] <BinaryKitten> and calculate it
[02:31:36] <saschagehlich> sure, not a big thing
[02:31:41] <saschagehlich> but always easier if there's a plugin :D
[02:31:50] <BinaryKitten> not always
[02:35:31] <sayakb> BinaryKitten: i guess its a better practice to use e.preventDefault() then to return false?
[02:35:58] <sayakb> i made some changes, i removed the return from the delete button click, and set dialog to false on bo button click. works perfectly now
[02:36:01] <BinaryKitten> not definitive
[02:36:09] <sayakb> ok
[02:36:14] <sayakb> so either is fine?
[02:36:22] <BinaryKitten> depends on situation really
[02:36:43] <BinaryKitten> can i ask why you changed to false?
[02:37:11] <hyper_ch> so, finally I almost got the new jquerui tooltip to work as I want :) now comes the styling problem :(
[02:37:14] <sayakb> BinaryKitten: if you click no, the modal closes, then click on the delete button again will not show the modal at all
[02:37:22] <BinaryKitten> ah
[02:37:42] <BinaryKitten> so you added a false to the other button click
[02:37:57] <BinaryKitten> that makes sense
[02:37:58] <sayakb> no, if i did, it wasnt closing the modal
[02:38:07] <sayakb> i removed all returns!
[02:38:08] <BinaryKitten> ?
[02:38:25] <BinaryKitten> that's find sayakb
[02:38:34] <sayakb> ok! thanks again
[02:38:44] <BinaryKitten> sayakb did you change like 7?
[02:38:47] <BinaryKitten> *line 7
[02:39:03] <BinaryKitten> of http://pastebin.com/WNk6keDT
[02:39:59] <sayakb> BinaryKitten: no, added this: http://paste.kde.org/568880/
[02:40:15] <sayakb> line 7 is intact
[02:41:02] <BinaryKitten> awesome
[02:41:03] <BinaryKitten> :)
[02:56:52] <tdskate> hi
[03:07:05] <Noeble> question: is it posible to disable the ability to select text in a div? With select I mean mark with the pointer

[04:10:01] <[1]mmcorrelo> hello!!
[04:12:37] <[1]mmcorrelo> I need to upload an image to the server through ajax. is there any way to do this?
[04:15:29] <[1]mmcorrelo> join
[04:16:39] <dblosevn> couple ways
[04:16:57] <dblosevn> most common and supported is uploading through an iframe
[04:17:37] <dblosevn> newer browsers ie excluded now support ajaxupload
[04:24:01] <dblosevn> http://www.albanx.com/ I use this in a few of my projects, says obsolete but I have not had any issues with it in any browser, it uses html5 upload with fallback to iframe for browsers that dont support html5 uploading, doesnt require flash or any librarys other then jquery
[04:24:17] <dblosevn> Has nice skinable progress as well
[04:25:23] <[1]mmcorrelo> tanks!! :)
[04:25:39] <monostar> hello, i want to display the one time cookie based popup block displayed on all pages irrespective of index page. how can i set this? in this page the popup block is not displayed but once you click home page, the block appears
[04:25:53] <monostar> http://shortefilms.com/video/1022/Sintel-
[04:27:12] <monostar> the popup box is not displayed in above link, but it appears in the index home page onlu
[04:27:14] <monostar> only*
[04:27:27] <monostar> i want it to display in all pages
[04:27:45] <dblosevn> easest way would be server side but you could set it with jquery as well
[04:28:01] <dblosevn> are you using a server sided scripting language such as php ?
[04:28:01] <monostar> yes, i had used jquery
[04:28:17] <monostar> yes
[04:28:20] <monostar> smarty php
[04:28:34] <dblosevn> put your popup code in an include
[04:28:43] <dblosevn> {include file="popup.html"}
[04:28:47] <dblosevn> for smarty
[04:29:09] <dblosevn> set your cookie with php
[04:29:23] <dblosevn> http://php.net/setcookie
[04:30:21] <dblosevn> and in your template do something like {if !isset($smarty.COOKIE.cookiename)}{include file="popup.html}{/if}
[04:30:24] <monostar>  i had used cookie.js file
[04:30:47] <dblosevn> thats the easest way
[04:30:56] <monostar> http://pastebin.com/sG7K5fpV
[04:31:09] <dblosevn> you could also test on the clientside for the cookie
[04:31:11] <monostar> cant we change that code to display it on every page?
[04:31:42] <dblosevn> this irc client sucks cant click links
[04:32:29] <dblosevn> alright i see it sec
[04:32:31] <monostar> and this is the function called
[04:32:33] <monostar> http://pastebin.com/tmJYD3rk
[04:32:39] <monostar> ok
[04:33:26] <dblosevn> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9173947/jquery-set-cookie-for-first-visit
[04:33:44] <dblosevn> thats what you want, way cleaner then all that code you pasted
[04:33:54] <dblosevn> then just include the js on every page
[04:35:41] <dblosevn> ya that code looks fine
[04:35:46] <dblosevn> just include it on every page
[04:35:52] <monostar> thanks, will give it try
[04:36:57] <dblosevn> the != -1 might not work though
[04:37:16] <dblosevn> id change that to != null
[04:38:01] <dblosevn> $.cookie('20080521') != null
[04:39:17] <monostar> ok
[04:46:40] <saschagehlich> did anyone ever hear of a bug that triggers mousedown events on the wrong dom element? o_O
[04:47:06] <dblosevn> is it close to the right element?
[04:47:49] <saschagehlich> nope
[04:48:05] <saschagehlich> it looks like it's triggered on an element that has been clicked some time before
[04:48:15] <dblosevn> never seen that, but could be the same issue i had in the past with box models
[04:48:51] <dblosevn> usually an issue with your sleector though
[04:49:02] <saschagehlich> hmm
[04:49:18] <dblosevn> selector even
[04:50:02] <dblosevn> are you using ids or classes? and if ids are you sure theres not a dup of that id
[04:50:33] <saschagehlich> I'm selecting the elements directly since I create them by code
[04:50:56] <dblosevn> hmm and your setting the onclick before adding them to the dom?
[04:51:30] <saschagehlich> nope, first I add them to the dom, then I attach the events
[04:51:36] <saschagehlich> or the event listeners
[04:52:22] <dblosevn> pastebin? i can only assume the listener is only being attached to the first or last element in the loop
[04:53:02] <saschagehlich> it's a quite huge app so it's hard to give you useful code :D
[04:53:22] <dblosevn> i usually attach my listeners right after creating the element
[04:53:30] <saschagehlich> yeah me too
[04:53:41] <saschagehlich> well i creat it and append it to the body instantly
[04:53:44] <dblosevn> then i append to the dom
[04:53:47] <saschagehlich> afterwards I attach the listeners
[04:55:46] <dblosevn> if its something that has actually been clicked but in the past do you have something blocking for a while before click?
[04:56:05] <dblosevn> eg a syncronous request or long loop
[04:56:10] <saschagehlich> nope
[04:56:45] <dblosevn> it has to be the binding then, id almost bet the event is only bound to one element
[04:59:03] <dblosevn> how are you attaching the listener, are you storing a reference to the element before you append to the dom?
[04:59:15] <saschagehlich> hang on i guess i got the bug...
[04:59:56] <saschagehlich> well what I'm doing is… I implemented drag and drop, so on element.mouseup I do $(document).off 'mousemove', myMouseMoveHandler
[04:59:56] <dblosevn> eg var a = $('<a/>'); ..... append to dom..... $(a).click(callback) ?
[05:00:13] <saschagehlich> but after removing the event, I do some stuff (going through an array, manipulating js objects, stuff like that)
[05:00:43] <saschagehlich> the stuff I do after removing the events is pretty fast, it takes like 1ms or so
[05:00:47] <saschagehlich> but this causes the bug somehow
[05:02:31] <dblosevn> so do you just remove the events from the dropped item?
[05:02:51] <saschagehlich> well, let me show you what I did...
[05:03:03] <saschagehlich> (it's coffeescript, please don't hit me)
[05:03:29] <dblosevn> too far away need a bigger stick lol
[05:03:37] <saschagehlich> :D
[05:03:47] <saschagehlich> https://gist.github.com/169bd94a6488b8ed79d9
[05:04:11] <saschagehlich> so that's what I did… I attach a mousemove handler to the document so the item can be moved around. when the mouse button is released, I remove the mousemove event from the document
[05:04:37] <saschagehlich> but after removing the event, I iterate through an array and update some data I need. this takes 1 or 2ms
[05:04:53] <saschagehlich> THEN I return false, so then the event is done
[05:05:37] <saschagehlich> these 1 or 2ms confuse the browser somehow. so I moved the for-loop out into a seperate function which I now call after removing the event
[05:05:42] <saschagehlich> and voila, it works… weird stuff
[05:06:15] <dblosevn> really weird
[05:06:36] <dblosevn> your mousemove callback may not have been canceling when you thought it was
[05:06:55] <dblosevn> and blocking the events from being added back
[05:07:30] <saschagehlich> yup
[05:07:33] <dblosevn> eg... mousemove canceled but there were still 1500 mousemove events queued
[05:07:58] <dblosevn> an event.stopPropagtion probally would have fixed it
[05:09:12] <dblosevn> or worse one of the queued events turned the listener back on :-D
[05:09:50] <dblosevn> which is more likely being the events were never reattached
[05:15:30] <dblosevn> i usually use jquery.ui.draggable for that stuff so i dont have to think about the actual drag/drop code and can focus on my app lol
[05:17:31] <monostar> if i change it to null, the popup is not atall  displaying
[05:18:00] <monostar> and the code you had suggested, if i use it it is displayed in alert popup which i dont like to use.
[05:18:10] <dblosevn> ...
[05:18:12] <monostar> i want to display block using divs and pure css
[05:18:17] <dblosevn> replace the alert with your popup code
[05:18:48] <monostar> yes, if i change the alert code it displays a popup window
[05:18:49] <dblosevn> cant rememebr the function think it was tc_ something
[05:19:18] <monostar> but i want popup block with divs and spans
[05:20:00] <dblosevn> so replace the alert with tb_show("<strong>Subscribe n Share</strong>", "#TB_inline?height=420&width=475&inlineId=mypopup","");
[05:20:25] <monostar> ohk
[05:20:39] <dblosevn> I just ponted you in the right direction didnt give you the full solution
[05:20:45] <monostar> yep
[05:21:07] <dblosevn> you didnt have an issue with displaying the popup, you had an issue with the cookie, i assumeed you would fix that lol
[05:24:46] <dblosevn> and you say != null doesnt work? the docs say it reutrns null if the cookie doesnt exist
[05:25:36] <dblosevn> the right way to write that would be null !== $.cookie however but it should do the same thing
[05:28:36] <monostar> ok
[05:34:03] <monostar> the code works fine but it is displayed only on index home page as previous code
[05:36:18] <dblosevn> well...if it is displayed on the index page then the cookie is set and it wont be displayed on anyother page
[05:36:34] <dblosevn> *another
[05:36:35] <monostar> nope
[05:36:48] <dblosevn> so you want it to display once per page?
[05:36:55] <monostar> if i delete cookies and open a sub page directly, the cookie is not set
[05:37:02] <dblosevn> oh
[05:37:15] <monostar> but i click home, it is displayed and cookie is set
[05:37:23] <monostar> but if*
[05:37:36] <dblosevn> it should work just fine if you put the exact same code on the other pages
[05:37:55] <dblosevn> unless your missing something and it errors before it can pop the popover and set the cookie
[05:38:06] <dblosevn> check firebug for errors
[05:38:13] <monostar> k
[05:38:47] <monostar> but as i kept the code in global header page , it must apply to each and everypage, right?
[05:38:57] <dblosevn> ya it should
[05:39:04] <monostar> its not happening
[05:39:36] <monostar> only if i open home page directly, the cookie is set.
[05:39:40] <dblosevn> something is different about the other pages
[05:40:11] <dblosevn> is there any other javascript before the pop over code?
[05:40:21] <monostar> yeah
[05:40:25] <monostar> there are few
[05:40:30] <dblosevn> in the same script block?
[05:40:40] <monostar> nope
[05:40:54] <monostar> in the same script, there is no other js code
[05:41:02] <monostar> just some div code with content
[05:41:41] <dblosevn> set a breakpoint on your if statement and see if it stops there
[05:42:01] <dblosevn> not inside of it on the if statement itself
[05:42:55] <Kenjin> hi
[05:43:11] <dblosevn> hi :-)
[05:45:09] <Kenjin> dblosevn: :)
[05:46:03] <Kenjin> I'm having a little trouble with jquery autocomplete. It seems the "response:" option is not triggered. What would be the best way to debug this?
[05:46:41] <Kenjin> everything else works as intended source:, focus:, search:
[05:52:10] <dblosevn> are you using a callback or a anyonomous function?
[05:55:51] <Kenjin> dblosevn: it seems response is only available on 1.9. I'm using 1.8!!! argh
[05:57:15] <dblosevn> well that would do it lol
[05:57:26] <dblosevn> although
[05:57:49] <dblosevn> in 1.8 you could probally put your response code in the success callback of source
[05:58:52] <dyret> I'd like to use the html5 sessionStorage webstorage feature, but I need it to be compatible with older browsers (non-html5-supported) as well.. is there a good framwork out there using some magic to fix this compability-issue for us??
[05:59:40] <dblosevn> http://pastebin.com/mDs4G1nc
[06:00:23] <dblosevn> example of using succes in the source event
[06:01:45] <dblosevn> i havent played with it in a long time but google gears was the solution for that before html5
[06:02:33] <dblosevn> dont know if it exists anymore though
[06:15:54] <dyret> anyone knows of a framework to handle browser-compability-issues with session- and local-storage?
[06:24:58] <dyret> I'm setting up event-handlers on dom-elements which might not be in the dom-tree when attaching these handlers. is this bad practice? should I search the dom-tree first to see if it exist, or is this handled without breaking anything when atcching the handler?
[06:30:26] <dblosevn> using jquery, the events wouldnt be attached if the elements didnt exist
[06:31:07] <dblosevn> jquery searches the dom for the elements and attaches to each element it finds, if it doesnt find an element it doesnt attach an event
[06:32:48] <dblosevn> if your not using jquery you would get an error object not set to an instance blah blah
[06:35:53] <Schyzo> Hello everyone
[06:36:27] <Schyzo> I noticed that jquery ui has moved to 1.9. Is there a way to build a custom download for 1.8 ? I can't find it on the website :(
[06:38:29] <dblosevn> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.23/jquery-ui.min.js
[06:43:51] <dblosevn> your not going to be able to build a custom 1.8 anymore  now that they released 1.9
[06:44:38] <dblosevn> with the builder anyways, you can build your own though
[06:56:22] <Guest71887> ??
[07:13:19] <Schyzo> thanks dblosevn I am not really used to the builder as I never used it before
[07:13:24] <Schyzo> I'll give it a try
[07:14:03] <Schyzo> Or maybe you were talking about the download builder...
[07:14:05] <Dr4g> good afternoon
[07:16:12] <Mohsen_Hassani> I'm using two different jquery plugins in one html; If I use them one by one, they work ok; but they don't work together; what's wrong?
[07:17:53] <Mohsen_Hassani> Oh! Problem solved! I was loading jquery.js twice. Weird!
[07:34:47] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: online?
[07:39:48] <eshlox> http://o.aolcdn.com/aboutme/core/v1.0.3/aboutme.loader.js => http://wklej.org/id/847187/ this load aboutme.core.js which contains something like http://wklej.org/id/847190/ How i can overwrite var MediaTools?
[08:27:44] <optraz> how to check if a string is within a <table></table> ?
[08:29:40] <CrawfordComeaux> hyper_ch: what's up?
[08:30:46] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: http://dragon.sjau.ch/ check it out nwo ;) much better
[08:33:34] <CrawfordComeaux> yeah, but a little off because of the whole ajax thing
[08:33:50] <hyper_ch> a little off?
[08:33:58] <CrawfordComeaux> I think you should load all the data once as JSON on page load
[08:34:01] <hyper_ch> if you're skipping to fast over multiple entries
[08:34:24] <CrawfordComeaux> don't blame the user ;)
[08:34:42] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: the table is 853KB
[08:34:52] <hyper_ch> I don't think you should put so much by json on page load
[08:35:19] <CrawfordComeaux> I don't think you should be doing it as dynamic tooltip loading
[08:35:25] <hyper_ch> (18 thousand entries)
[08:35:54] <hyper_ch> how then?
[08:36:11] <CrawfordComeaux> i'm not sure...I don't know what the purpose of this thing is
[08:37:00] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: it's a stupid game for your cell phone
[08:37:37] <CrawfordComeaux> mobile or actual cell phone?
[08:37:43] <CrawfordComeaux> sorry...smartphone?
[08:37:51] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: where you have (currently) 57 different dragons and you can breed them and get dragons you still miss.... so I want to track what dragons I have and how I can breed the missing ones
[08:37:56] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: yeah, it's a phone app
[08:38:05] <hyper_ch> don't start on it, you waste too much time ;)
[08:52:19] <gordian> guys what's a good image+caption carousel?
[08:52:49] <gordian> ideally i'm looking for one that will let me show the next/prev slides on either side of the main/active slide
[09:00:02] <optraz> in a id , how do i find an input value?
[09:00:24] <optraz> i tried that dont work =>    alert($('#foo').find('input').val());
[09:00:45] <gordian> $("#id").attr("input");
[09:00:57] <gordian> try that optraz
[09:01:44] <optraz> gordian: no, #id is an id for a table
[09:01:49] <optraz> inside this table, it has a few input
[09:02:00] <optraz> i want to find a specific input that has name bar
[09:31:25] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: I wonder if I should change from tooltip to jqueryui dialog... that should work right?
[09:35:05] <CrawfordComeaux> hyper_ch: I'm not sure. the whole overall interface feels a little odd
[09:35:16] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: what's odd?
[09:36:57] <CrawfordComeaux> trying to cram that much dynamic data into single controls?
[09:39:16] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: :)
[09:39:49] <CrawfordComeaux> you could use local storage to store the whole table
[09:39:58] <CrawfordComeaux> and then just treat it like a cache
[09:39:58] <hyper_ch> what do you mean by that?
[09:40:15] <CrawfordComeaux> only updating the parts that have changed since last load
[09:40:30] <hyper_ch> still no idea what you mean
[09:41:37] <_zoggy_> be careful though
[09:41:53] <_zoggy_> incogito mode = no local storage.
[09:43:00] <CrawfordComeaux> hyper_ch: http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp
[10:10:18] <Still> Hi, does anyone know how to fix the characterset of imported data?
[10:11:15] <batfastad> Anyone use the BlockUI plugin? I'm trying to centre align my popup message both horizontally and vertically but it looks like it's hardcoded to absolute positioning in the default options
[10:44:55] <cirenyc> I am looking for something to do a "wheel of fortune style" hide and show of panels of an image.  On click, a section of a larger image is shown.  Anyone know of anything for this?
[10:58:56] <NexHD> hi
[10:59:11] <NexHD> i want to ask why i have this error
[10:59:11] <NexHD> Notice: Undefined index: submit in J:\htdocs\register.php on line 55
[10:59:12] <NexHD> ?
[11:00:10] <dipser> there is no submit ^^
[11:01:46] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: I changed now to jqueryui dialog
[11:13:16] <faraway> NexHD: well sounds like a php problem ;)
[11:22:06] <abcdef> Hi! I'm using Blueimp JQuery File Uploader. I'd like to upload files without submitting the form. Therefore I set autoUpload: true but it seems that form is beeing submitted
[11:35:08] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone
[11:35:17] <jarr0dsz> how do you call those black layovers when you click a lightbox?
[11:35:27] <jarr0dsz> the screen turns black a few shades.. i can't recall the naming for that
[11:36:01] <hyper_ch> jarr0dsz: dimming?
[11:36:26] <hyper_ch> "to dim the lights"
[11:37:07] <jarr0dsz> dimming yes something like that thx
[11:37:14] <jarr0dsz> im not native english ;p
[11:37:23] <hyper_ch> neither am I
[11:59:58] <Xtrivity> Hey guys - whats the easiest way to convert an object to string. Trying to make var temp = (e.target).data('clicked',href); into a simple string. Tried wrapping it in string() and toString() --- clearly i'm doing something incorrect.
[12:07:11] <millun> hi,
[12:07:28] <millun> my plupload bound event doesn't fire. anybody had that?
[12:08:26] <millun> $(plupload).bind('QueueChanged', function(up) { alert('Foo'); } won't happen. it is loaded by DOM listing. it just doesn't fire
[12:15:19] <pifantastic> Xtrivity: why do you want to turn a jQuery object into a string?
[12:15:43] <pifantastic> when you call .data() with 2 arguments, it is "setting" the property, and therefore returns the jQuery object so you can continue chainging
[12:15:45] <pifantastic> chaining*
[12:18:40] <pifantastic> millun: are you sure the event is supposed to fire?
[12:18:50] <millun> yes pifantastic
[12:18:59] <millun> BUT i found a workaround
[12:19:15] <pifantastic> and you are binding the event to the new plupload.Uploader() object?
[12:19:33] <millun> actually, i don't know plupload that much..... ain't that much sure about its internals
[12:20:05] <millun> i found it in DOM, so thought i could use it
[12:20:18] <millun> ($(plupload) variable)
[12:20:20] <pifantastic> millun: in your code example, I don't know what the `plupload` variable eis
[12:20:39] <pifantastic> yeah, that needs to be an instance of plupload.Uploader or it's not going to work
[12:21:43] <millun> as for FireBug listing : plupload Object { VERSION="1.5.4", STOPPED=1, STARTED=2, více...}
[12:23:43] <millun> (it was instantiated in other script..... i'm using a plugin that integrates plupload and other interfaces into Nette PHP framework)
[12:24:55] <millun> i don't get any errors. it just seems like when i add a file, nothing happens. not even the alert or any error
[12:25:22] <pifantastic> millun: interesting. perhaps something else is also binding to that event, and stopping it
[12:25:31] <millun> ahh
[12:25:36] <millun> didn't think of that.
[12:25:43] <millun> i'll look for that
[12:29:26] <monostar> cant we set cookie through non index pages?
[12:29:50] <monostar> i see cookie is set only when we access root folder with index.php file
[12:30:15] <monostar> if i access other pages like members.php directly, the cookie isnt being set
[12:49:00] <dblosevn> monostar you still didnt figure that out?
[12:49:07] <monostar> nope
[12:49:35] <dblosevn> did you drop a breakpoint where I asked you too earlier?
[12:49:36] <monostar> dont know why it isnt showing up on other pages beside index.php
[12:49:49] <monostar> unable to do it
[12:50:01] <monostar> havent succeeded
[12:50:55] <dblosevn> what do you mean your "unable to doit?" do you not have firebug?
[12:51:06] <dblosevn> or google chrome
[12:51:07] <monostar> yeah, i do
[12:51:22] <monostar> i use firefox and firebug is already installed
[12:51:25] <dblosevn> then find your if statement in the script tab
[12:51:50] <dblosevn> and click the left margin on the line with the if statment
[12:52:00] <dblosevn> it will make a little red dot in the margin
[12:52:06] <dblosevn> then refresh the page
[12:52:19] <dblosevn> see if the debugger stops on the breakpoint
[12:53:19] <monostar> ok
[12:53:30] <dblosevn> did it stop?
[12:53:43] <monostar> yes
[12:54:04] <dblosevn> ok so there are no problems before that line
[12:54:19] <dblosevn> now set one inside the if
[12:54:33] <dblosevn> and click the little play looking like button
[12:54:38] <monostar> ok
[12:54:46] <dblosevn> see if it stops inside the if statement
[12:55:02] <dblosevn> remove the breakpoint on the if statement
[12:56:27] <dblosevn> oh i missed that
[12:56:40] <dblosevn> are your subpages in a diferent directory?
[12:57:27] <monostar> when i set breakpoint to if statement and click refresh, the break point moved right after the end script tag of that code
[12:57:30] <monostar> yes
[12:57:54] <dblosevn> and its not index.php in the url is it its something like /home/
[12:58:09] <monostar> they are automatically created using the database values and supporting php file
[12:58:21] <monostar> yes
[12:58:31] <dblosevn> your cookie path is /home/
[12:58:32] <monostar> ./videos/
[12:58:43] <monostar> yes
[12:58:45] <dblosevn> well /home/
[12:58:56] <dblosevn> neeed to */videos/
[12:59:05] <dblosevn> need to change the cookie path to /
[12:59:40] <monostar> ok
[13:00:36] <dblosevn> let me see your code again
[13:00:53] <monostar> 1 sec
[13:01:34] <monostar> http://pastebin.com/wCnhQbiA
[13:02:41] <EvilGenius> Hi
[13:03:14] <EvilGenius> $('#icon-remove').click(function()
[13:03:15] <EvilGenius>     and <i class=\"icon-remove\" id=\"".$data['uid']."\"></i>     what am i doing wrong?
[13:03:34] <dblosevn> your not using jquery $.cookies any more
[13:04:04] <monostar> yes
[13:04:14] <pifantastic> EvilGenius: $('.icon-remove')
[13:04:32] <monostar> i had removed the cookie.js file and that code
[13:04:49] <monostar> replaced with new code
[13:05:12] <dblosevn> the i tag has been depreciated you should use em and you might want to put a non breaking space inside the tag as some brosers wont expand the tag
[13:06:06] <EvilGenius> <pifantastic>thanks
[13:06:35] <dblosevn> are you using php sessions as well @monostar
[13:06:45] <monostar> yes
[13:06:48] <pifantastic> dblosevn: the i tag is still valid
[13:07:06] <dblosevn> yes it still works but it not reccomended
[13:07:13] <jwmann> Can I make regular javascript functions within a $(document).ready(function() { }); ?
[13:07:23] <yes> yes you are
[13:07:26] <yes> heh
[13:07:28] <pifantastic> dblosevn: it depends on what you are doing
[13:07:39] <jwmann> Haha, just referenced your own nick answering that
[13:07:46] <pifantastic> dblosevn: it's valid to want to italicize something without adding emphasis
[13:07:58] <and> i wonder
[13:08:02] <and> nope
[13:08:13] <and> i'm going to get pinged like crazy now lol
[13:08:14] <eshlox> ok, i try again, http://o.aolcdn.com/aboutme/core/v1.0.3/aboutme.loader.js => http://wklej.org/id/847187/ this load aboutme.core.js which contains something like http://wklej.org/id/847190/ How i can overwrite var MediaTools? (example html/js http://wklej.org/id/847221/ )
[13:08:20] <dblosevn> b i and u havent been suggested for years its not suggested to use text-decoration if you dont need emphasis
[13:08:23] <pifantastic> jwmann: what do you mean?
[13:08:38] <pifantastic> jwmann: oh, I re-read that. Yes you can
[13:08:44] <jwmann> ^__^
[13:08:45] <jwmann> ty
[13:08:50] <pifantastic> jwmann: but you need to understand javascript scoping
[13:08:56] <pifantastic> or you may end up becoming confused
[13:09:09] <jwmann> Ty for the heads up
[13:09:20] <dblosevn> i still use them occassionally when im lazy too though lol
[13:09:21] <necroforest> If i am running a web page locally from the file system (no server), can i use jquery.get() to load a local text file? (i.e., $.get("./blah.data", <...>); )
[13:09:42] <pifantastic> jwmann: functions declared lile: "function foo() {}" inside $(document).ready(function() {}); are not global
[13:09:56] <pifantastic> necroforest: I don't think so
[13:10:00] <jwmann> Understood
[13:10:20] <dblosevn> reguardless you should always put something inside an empty tag, as not all browsers will expand it .... hence older versions of IE :-)
[13:12:59] <jwmann> I forgot what $('foo', 'bar') selection does..
[13:13:27] <jwmann> would it be selecting all bar within foo?
[13:17:11] <defaultro> hey folks, i have a <div id="someid"></div> and it gets populated when I click something. What would be the code to remove all the tags, attr, elements that have been added? I would like to restore it back to on a click to this again -> <div id="someid"></div>
[13:17:31] <defaultro> will .html("") work?
[13:17:38] <brass> .epty()
[13:17:42] <defaultro> cool
[13:17:44] <brass> .empty()
[13:17:46] <defaultro> i'll try
[13:19:11] <defaultro> it worked! :D
[13:19:17] <defaultro> thanks a lot brass!!!
[13:19:31] <monostar> a question mark is appearing when i click play button
[13:21:05] <dblosevn> @monostar use this for you set cookie line document.cookie = "visited=true;expires=" + expires.toUTCString() + ';path=/';
[13:23:45] <EvilGenius> http://paste2.org/p/2336266 -- this code is just removing that one location on the table see here http://i.imgur.com/d183j.jpg
[13:23:55] <EvilGenius> how do i get it to remove the whole row
[13:24:23] <scrandaddy> is it a good idea to avoid jquery as a dependency of a library i'm writing? i think jquery is amazing, but will users of my library be frustrated that they have to include it?
[13:24:31] <monostar> changed. but still same
[13:25:24] <dblosevn> and what happens if you drop a breakpoint on var fifteenDays = 1000*60*60*24*15; ?
[13:28:20] <necroforest> This snippet doesn't appear to work, is there some scope rule I'm not aware of? : var xyz = ""; var cb=function(x) { xyz = x; }  <- when cb("asdf") is called, it does not change xyz.
[13:28:33] <monostar> i got something when i set breakpoint 1 for if condition
[13:28:45] <monostar> _ltas.setChannel('gxkikomdpxhutew', '0')({"ads":{},"tracking":{}});
[13:29:37] <dblosevn> @pifantastic, i reread the w3c spec and it seems I misinterpreted it the last time i read it they do suggest using the other tags whenever possible but the use of B I and U are still allowed. my bad I can admit when im worng lol
[13:30:20] <jwmann> Does jQuery have string interpolation?
[13:30:36] <pifantastic> jwmann: no
[13:30:39] <jwmann> Hmm
[13:30:47] <jwmann> I'm having a weird problem
[13:31:23] <jwmann> I have a function that works fine but when I use a string it breaks my selection..
[13:31:55] <monostar> this is returned when i set breakpoint for var fifteendays line
[13:31:57] <monostar> (function () {var s = document.createElement("script");s.type = "text/javascript";s.async = true;s.src = "http://i.po.st/share/script/post-widget.js#publisherKey=ojjaq2p5c81bg585af81";var x = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];x.parentNode.insertBefore(s, x);}());
[13:32:25] <jwmann> Wait, figured it out!
[13:33:49] <pifantastic> dblosevn: :)
[13:35:08] <dblosevn> hmm, firebug sometimes does that if it was not resumed before reloading the page, hence firebug was stopped at a breakpoint and never clicked run again brefore refreshing click the "play" button and see if it stops where you would expect it too
[13:46:59] <njbair> I want to use jQuery UI to animate the .addClass() method and stuff like that, but I'm not interested in the other UI elements as I am using bootstrap for those. Do I even need the jQuery UI CSS file?
[13:49:23] <Whirl3d> no
[13:51:55] <cuit> Hi, how do I say this('this' being the css class being moused over, but not that class, just this one instance of this class that is being moused over) but the .classname inside of 'this'?
[13:57:21] <hiall> http://paste2.org/p/2336351 why would that log 0?
[14:25:52] <Whirl3d> cuit. Are you asking $(this).attr('class');?
[14:27:09] <Whirl3d> $(".elemclass").mouseenter(function (e) { var itm=$(this); console.log(itm.attr('class'));});
[14:28:32] <Whirl3d> hiall, the e in your function is the iterator. Which starts at 0. If you had two inputs, you would get 01 for example
[14:31:00] <xorl> does anyone knows how to scroll down a text box?
[14:31:31] <Whirl3d> adust the scrollTop property of the textbox
[14:32:30] <xorl> Whirl3d, i tried to do it, like this:  $(document).ready(function () { $("txtConversa").scrollTop(300); });
[14:32:34] <xorl> buts doesnt work...
[14:32:40] <xorl> can you see any error in the code?
[14:33:29] <Whirl3d> first of all the selector is wrong.
[14:33:49] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[14:34:00] <Whirl3d> $("txtConversa") indicates select the html element of type txtConversa...which doesnt exist. Try a . before the txtConversa
[14:34:13] <Whirl3d> morning mfoxdogg|work
[14:34:20] <xorl> Whirl3d, let me try....
[14:34:24] <mfoxdogg|work> hi Whirl3d
[14:36:12] <xorl> Whirl3d, didnt worked... txtConversa is a name of a TextBox object...
[14:36:17] <Whirl3d> xorl, also, scrollTop isn't a method
[14:36:24] <Whirl3d> it's an property or attribute
[14:36:43] <Whirl3d> $(".txtConversa").prop("scrollTop",300);
[14:36:50] <xorl> http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[14:36:51] <xorl> look
[14:36:57] <xorl> here say it is a method...
[14:37:04] <Whirl3d> I stand corrected. LOL
[14:37:21] <Whirl3d> I always set the scrollTop or animate the scrollTop property.
[14:37:31] <xorl> humm...
[14:38:45] <Whirl3d> are you sure txtConversa is scrollable?
[14:39:10] <xorl> yes, it's a textbox, and it's scrollable...
[14:41:25] <xorl> its a <input type="text" name="txtConversa" id="txtConversa">
[14:42:52] <dblosevn> #txtConversa not .
[14:43:57] <Whirl3d> Can you scroll an input textbox?
[14:44:17] <xorl> yes
[14:44:19] <dblosevn> i wasnt aware you could honestly i always use textarea for that
[14:44:35] <xorl> hum
[14:44:40] <xorl> let me see in the code
[14:45:01] <xorl> because i did it in asp.net, in html i doesnt saw what control it is converted to...
[14:45:31] <xorl> its a textarea
[14:45:35] <xorl> you are corret...
[14:45:36] <dblosevn> pretty sure multiline text box in asp.net gets converted to textarea
[14:45:43] <xorl> yep
[14:45:52] <xorl> i saw it right now
[14:45:52] <xorl> but
[14:46:02] <xorl> the problem is the same
[14:46:10] <dblosevn> what selector are you using?
[14:47:39] <xorl> i think the jquery.js wasnt being found (path incorretct)... let me see if that is the problem
[14:48:08] <xorl> no, the path is correct...
[14:48:22] <xorl> i'm using "[type=text]"
[14:48:32] <xorl> $(document).ready(function () { $("[type=text]").scrollTop(300); });
[14:48:55] <xorl> owo!
[14:49:00] <xorl> thats the problem
[14:49:07] <xorl> that isnt a text
[14:49:10] <xorl> :D
[14:49:12] <xorl> let me see now
[14:49:39] <xorl> if id="name" i use selector like: (".name") ?
[14:51:05] <dblosevn> for id youd use #name
[14:51:20] <dblosevn> class .name
[14:51:25] <dblosevn> element name
[14:53:13] <xorl> let me try
[14:54:00] <xorl> WORKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDD
[14:54:05] <xorl> jQuery RULEZ!!!!!!!!!!
[14:54:21] <dblosevn> so in your case "#conversa" would work by id, "textarea" would select all textareas, "textarea[name="conversa]" would target a text area with the name conversa
[14:54:29] <xorl> Thanks Whirl3d and dblosevn!!! :))
[14:54:47] <dblosevn> :-D
[14:56:03] <xorl> welll... but the AJAX of the ASP.NET is not running the jQuery :\
[14:56:09] <xorl> i have a web chat
[14:56:11] <xorl> a buton
[14:56:15] <xorl> a textarea
[14:56:38] <xorl> when a click on the button, the code $(document).ready(function () { $("#txtConversa").scrollTop(300); }); works fine
[14:56:49] <xorl> but, when the ajax timmer gives a tick
[14:56:53] <xorl> the code isnt executed
[14:57:54] <xorl> when i* click on the button
[14:58:56] <hiall> Whirl3d: yea got it thanks
[15:00:22] <dblosevn> is your click event attached on ready?
[15:01:17] <dblosevn> ive had that problem if i attach the click listner outside of the onready block, as the element doesnt exist yet when the listener is sttempted to be bound
[15:02:01] <xorl> dblosevn, no... i have a button, so, if i click on it, all de page code is executed, so, the $(document).ready(function () { $("#txtConversa").scrollTop(300); }); code is executed...
[15:02:32] <xorl> but, when ajax occurrs, it just execute a code especifically, and doesnt execute $(document).ready(function () { $("#txtConversa").scrollTop(300); });
[15:02:39] <xorl> the problema i'm using ajax of asp.net =\
[15:04:47] <xorl> well, i read something here, i'll try...
[15:04:50] <xorl> lemesee
[15:04:57] <dblosevn> long time isnt i built an asp.net app, but it should bind your click properly
[15:06:23] <xorl> dblosevn, i'll change $(document).ready by function pageLoad() { ... }
[15:07:21] <dblosevn> ya, that could work... i was going to say do something like that i just couldnt rememebr the actual function name
[15:11:10] <xorl> WORKED!!!!!!!!!
[15:11:29] <xorl> here goes some documents to you all look, i think they are good:
[15:11:53] <xorl> first, see the second post here: http://forums.asp.net/t/1720193.aspx/1
[15:12:23] <xorl> second, go to the link the user chetan.sarode said: http://encosia.com/document-ready-and-pageload-are-not-the-same/
[15:12:41] <xorl> knows
[15:12:49] <xorl> just one more doubt... LOL
[15:13:18] <xorl> how can i set the scrollTop number dinamically, i dont want to put a fixed number there...
[15:13:27] <xorl> anyone know?
[15:14:47] <dblosevn> scroll height minus height
[15:15:44] <dblosevn> scrollTop = scrollHeight - height (of textarea)
[15:16:40] <xorl> hummm...
[15:17:34] <xorl> i want to put the scroll ever on down...
[15:17:55] <xorl> dblosevn, how can i get the scrollHeight?
[15:17:57] <dblosevn> im assuming you want the box to always stay at the last line of the chat
[15:18:11] <dblosevn> or last line always visible
[15:18:13] <xorl> yes
[15:18:17] <xorl> that's it
[15:18:34] <andornaut> is there any way to tell if a textarea has a different value than what it was originally rendered with (only needs to work in chrome 22+)?
[15:18:43] <andornaut> ^ same with an input element
[15:19:07] <dblosevn> var sh = $('#coversa').scrollHeight() - $('#conversa').height();
[15:19:19] <xorl> hummmm....
[15:19:37] <xorl> i think i undertood...
[15:19:40] <xorl> let me try!!! :)
[15:19:42] <dblosevn> $('#conversa').scrollTop(sh);
[15:20:18] <dblosevn> might want to test if sh is > 1 before setting scrollTop
[15:21:01] <dblosevn> might cause unpredictable results if you set scrolltop to a negative number
[15:21:57] <xorl> > 0 so...  w
[15:21:57] <xorl> ?
[15:22:31] <dblosevn> @andronaut not by it self you could do something like $('textarea').each(function() { $(this).attr('oldValue', this.value); } ); on load
[15:22:56] <dblosevn> then test if oldValue = current value later
[15:23:20] <xorl> what? O.O
[15:23:24] <xorl> LoL
[15:23:38] <dblosevn> that wasnt @xorl lol
[15:23:54] <andornaut> dblosevn: yeah, i was hoping for some method that didn't require recording the initial val
[15:24:03] <andornaut> dblosevn: but i realize that's probably too good to be true =)
[15:24:09] <dblosevn> not if your not using a framework such as ext
[15:24:25] <dblosevn> ext textboxes have the oldValue property
[15:24:28] <xorl> sorry, i thought was talking with me.. LOL
[15:24:47] <dblosevn> helpful of isDirty functions
[15:24:59] <andornaut> cool
[15:25:42] <andornaut> i guess i could stick them in a jquery data()
[15:26:53] <dblosevn> ya, i like attaching the old value to the element though makes it a lot easier to manage later
[15:27:04] <andornaut> yep
[15:28:15] <dblosevn> id add a class to all my input elements like form-field
[15:28:25] <dblosevn> do the each i showed you
[15:28:37] <dblosevn> then you can write an isdirty function with like 3 lines of code
[15:30:08] <dblosevn> function isDirty() { var dirty = false; $('.form-field').each(function() { if (this.oldValue != this.value) { dirty=true; } }); reutrn dirty;}
[15:32:00] <andornaut> dblosevn: thanks!
[15:32:07] <dblosevn> :-D
[15:32:44] <dblosevn> you might want to spell return right though i oviously didnt know how lmao
[15:32:55] <andornaut> =)
[15:34:05] <dblosevn> @xorl you figure out the scrollTop problem?
[15:34:11] <NetTalk> i am using this script for close the pop-up... "echo "<script type='text/javascript'>window.close();window.top.location.href = window.top.location.href;</script>";"
[15:34:31] <NetTalk> but only problem is that..... i am using the jquery tab syste,
[15:34:53] <NetTalk> and i want to reload the same parent tab after closing the pop-up window
[15:34:56] <NetTalk> any idea guys?
[15:35:34] <xorl> dblosevn, i'm trying until now but i cant got it to work... i googled too, but, no success...
[15:36:14] <brend_> hey guys i need to open a modal form using ajax.. what im i been doing wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/E24Bg/
[15:39:22] <dblosevn> @NetTalk http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1634909/refresh-tab-content-on-click-in-jquery-ui-tabs
[15:40:35] <dblosevn> hold a sec @xorl
[15:40:48] <brend_> ?
[15:41:03] <xorl> dblosevn, i think i'm gottinh it... i think i'll solve it... :P
[15:41:08] <xorl> dblosevn, let me try
[15:43:21] <dblosevn> @xorl http://pastebin.com/QuyYEpr0
[15:45:05] <dblosevn> basically just the height of the scroll container minus the height of the text area = scrolltop
[15:45:45] <xorl> yep, i know, but the problem is that height is a method() and scrollHeight i think isnt, that is what i'm seeing here
[15:45:47] <dblosevn> might want to add an else statement and set scrolltop to 0
[15:45:56] <dblosevn> oh
[15:46:09] <brend_> ?
[15:46:12] <brend_> ?
[15:46:18] <dblosevn> in that case use $('#conversa').attr('scrollTop');
[15:46:24] <xorl> yep!
[15:46:29] <xorl> let me try that! :D
[15:46:30] <dblosevn> Sorry scrollHeight
[15:46:38] <xorl> yep
[15:46:44] <xorl> np
[15:47:11] <dblosevn> thoguht juqery exposed scrollHeight as a method :-(
[15:48:02] <xorl> dblosevn, yep, i was here trying to understand why it wasnt working
[15:48:10] <xorl> so i decided to print the two
[15:48:15] <xorl> height returned a value
[15:48:26] <xorl> and scrollheight() returned a error...
[15:48:37] <dblosevn> does attr return a value?
[15:49:24] <xorl> i'm looking it now...
[15:49:51] <dblosevn> also you may want to check this out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6194837/somediv-attrscrollheight-not-working-in-jquery-1-6-1 seems you want to use .get(0).scrollHeight instead
[15:50:20] <xorl> dblosevn, returned ""undefined
[15:50:23] <xorl> dblosevn, returned "undefined"
[15:50:24] <dblosevn> depending on jquery version attr wont return a value for scrollHeight
[15:50:40] <xorl> i'm using 1.8.1 version
[15:50:42] <dblosevn> so $('#conversa').get(0).scrollHeight;
[15:50:58] <dblosevn> as of 1.6.1 it quit returning attr scollHeight
[15:51:18] <xorl> let me see...
[15:51:20] <dblosevn> you can alternately use $('#conversa').prop('scrollHeight);
[15:51:38] <xorl> worked!!!!
[15:51:39] <xorl> :D
[15:51:47] <xorl> dblosevn, worked!
[15:51:51] <dblosevn> :D
[15:51:53] <xorl> thanks soo much :D
[15:52:07] <xorl> let me do the all the code llike you pastebin
[15:52:13] <dblosevn> np, today is my day to give back lol
[15:52:17] <brend_> hey guys i need to open a modal form using ajax.. what im i been doing wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/E24Bg/
[15:52:30] <dblosevn> havent been on irc in years
[15:53:14] <brass> dblosevn, ditto
[15:53:22] <xorl> dblosevn, lol
[15:53:53] <dblosevn> @brend_ where are you actually calling loadModalAddresses?
[15:54:19] <dblosevn> oh im blind
[15:54:50] <brend_> dblosevn:  in the button
[15:55:02] <dblosevn> ya saw it after i asked
[15:55:38] <brend_> hehe
[15:55:47] <dblosevn> is the ajax call happening?
[15:55:53] <brend_> yes
[15:56:17] <brend_> checked that out in firebug.. but is not opening the modal
[15:56:17] <xorl> dblosevn, all working... :)
[15:56:27] <dblosevn> :-D @xorl
[15:56:43] <dblosevn> maybe it is opening the model
[15:57:04] <dblosevn> but your ajax call is replacing the dom elements inside of #modelAddresses
[15:57:10] <dblosevn> so you cant see it
[15:57:43] <brend_> mm
[15:57:47] <dblosevn> try creating the dialog inside of the success cqallback
[15:57:49] <brend_> im confused
[15:58:08] <brend_> ok
[15:59:00] <dblosevn> http://pastebin.com/9miGRcS2
[15:59:35] <dblosevn> oh and set autoOpen: true
[16:01:32] <brend_> well nothing =(
[16:01:42] <dblosevn> @brass ya im playing around with freepbx and it had a java irc client so i clicked the button
[16:01:46] <brend_> Doesnt want to show up i guess
[16:01:51] <dblosevn> lol
[16:02:07] <brend_> grr
[16:02:19] <dblosevn> how bout $('#modalAddresses').dialog().show();
[16:02:27] <dblosevn> after creating it
[16:02:53] <brend_> in the same success
[16:02:55] <brend_> ?
[16:03:00] <dblosevn> ya
[16:03:38] <dblosevn> http://pastebin.com/KsYyADAD
[16:04:29] <dblosevn> sorry its .open() now show()
[16:05:05] <dblosevn> *not .show()
[16:06:04] <jarr0dsz> anyone could recommend a good jquery dim screen overlay kinda plugin? or how to do it?
[16:06:18] <jarr0dsz> im looking for a way but many plugins with extra non needed functionality
[16:06:26] <jarr0dsz> want to dim screen and disable any clicks on it
[16:06:36] <dblosevn> blockUI is awesome and super simple to implement
[16:06:49] <dblosevn> or jquery.blockUI
[16:07:01] <tlkr> jarr0dsz, is a modal dialog not what you are looking for?
[16:07:08] <brend_> dblosevn:  im getting TypeError: $("#modalAddresses").dialog({bgiframe: true, autoOpen: true, height: 100, html: data, modal: true}).open is not a function
[16:07:11] <dblosevn> called as simply as $.block
[16:07:19] <jarr0dsz> no no not a modal i already have that, i need just to gray out everything beside a certain div
[16:07:25] <dblosevn> ya
[16:07:30] <jarr0dsz> wich is not a modal but a custom styled div
[16:07:37] <dblosevn> $('#divname').block()
[16:08:01] <dblosevn> leaves that divalone and blocks the rest of the page
[16:08:30] <brend_> kinda weird
[16:08:36] <jarr0dsz> asin, not be able to click it?
[16:08:42] <jarr0dsz> but it does not gray out the background right
[16:08:44] <dblosevn> #brend_ what is in data on response?
[16:09:01] <dblosevn> blockui does gray the background
[16:09:03] <NetTalk> i am trying to load the parent tab something like this... window.top.location.href+'#tab5' = window.top.location.href+'#tab5';
[16:09:08] <NetTalk> but it would seem to workl
[16:09:15] <jarr0dsz> this one does what i want but such a messy writeup http://www.jankoatwarpspeed.com/post/2009/05/17/Use-jQuery-to-turn-off-the-lights-while-watching-videos.aspx
[16:09:39] <NetTalk> i think there is syntax error
[16:09:40] <dblosevn> you can optionally set the color to your background color at runtime though if you choose
[16:10:03] <brend_> should this be good? modal: true
[16:11:03] <dblosevn> @brend_ the only thing i see that could cause a type error is html: data
[16:11:25] <dblosevn> is data an html response from the server or json?
[16:11:52] <brend_> html
[16:13:17] <brend_> =/
[16:16:31] <brend_> this is pissing me ogg
[16:17:00] <dblosevn> @brend_ http://pastebin.com/BejNjzya
[16:17:04] <dblosevn> try that
[16:17:11] <dblosevn> oh
[16:18:00] <dblosevn> http://pastebin.com/ZSuBgDMf that one should be right
[16:18:51] <brend_> the last one?
[16:18:54] <dblosevn> ya
[16:19:16] <dblosevn> replacing $.ajax with $element.load
[16:21:42] <brend_> dblosevn:  that worked fine =).. but is it commin to get the background grey when it shows up?
[16:21:59] <dblosevn> ?
[16:22:10] <dblosevn> ? common?
[16:22:16] <bot-t> dblosevn, UI/Common/common - http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Common/common
[16:22:18] <dblosevn> modal usually grays the background
[16:22:41] <dblosevn> thats cool :-D
[16:22:50] <brend_> ohh i see
[16:23:18] <brend_> db thanks very much.. hopefully theres ppl like u here to save lifes
[16:23:25] <brend_> dblosevn:
[16:23:53] <dblosevn> lol, i try, although dont think they would ever agree to make me a doctor
[16:24:40] <NexHD> how i fix this Notice: Undefined index: submit in J:\htdocs\register.php on line 55 ?
[16:25:19] <dblosevn> if (isset($_POST['submit'])) { on line 54
[16:25:20] <brass> on line 55 of register.php the variable is being referrence.
[16:25:44] <dblosevn> i usually do if (count($_POST)) around my contorllers though
[16:26:41] <dblosevn> your controller is either being executed when the form hasnt been submitted or you dont have a submit button named submit in your form
[16:28:47] <dblosevn> @NexHD
[16:28:56] <brass> NexHD, it might be good practice to prepare your POST data before accessing it
[16:28:59] <gowie> Hey is it a bad idea to unbind ~ 60 elements for about half a second and then rebind them? what are the performance implications of that?
[16:29:15] <dblosevn> depends on how many times you plan to do it
[16:29:16] <brass> $submit = ( isset($_POST['submit']) ) ? $_POST['submit'] : '';
[16:30:06] <dblosevn> @gowie
[16:30:10] <brass> NexHD, to see all of your post data.  echo "<pre>"; print_r($_POST); exit;
[16:30:29] <gowie> dblosevn uh probably pretty often? I have a matching card game and I want to turn off the click event when the cards are checking for a match and then turn it back on when they are flipped back over or matched...
[16:30:32] <Shadow> Hi, I'm using this for a dropdown for countries. Can anyone tell me how to add a reset button, that resets the dropdown to default when clicked. http://jamielottering.github.com/DropKick/
[16:30:38] <NexHD> i have this $submit_form = $_POST['submit'] is wrong?:d
[16:30:50] <dblosevn> @brass i just assumed it was a POST NextHD was talking about lol he never said
[16:30:57] <dblosevn> ya
[16:31:14] <gowie> dblosevn Is there a way to disable clicking on an entire element (like the parent container?) which would be better?
[16:31:29] <dblosevn> @NexHD: you need to test if $_POST isset
[16:32:35] <dblosevn> $('#parentelement').click(function () { return false; });
[16:32:43] <NexHD> how i test?
[16:32:55] <dblosevn> then $('#parentelement').unbund('click');
[16:33:07] <dblosevn> *unbind wow i cant type today :-D
[16:33:09] <brass> dblosevn, ah i see.
[16:33:21] <brass> NexHD, echo "<pre>"; print_r($_POST); exit;
[16:33:30] <brass> that will print all your POST variables to the screen then exit
[16:33:47] <brass> apparently, you don't have a variable called "submit" being posted.
[16:33:51] <dblosevn> @NexHd use the code brass gave you
[16:34:05] <NexHD> ok
[16:34:11] <NexHD> thanks
[16:34:31] <dblosevn> <brass> $submit = ( isset($_POST['submit']) ) ? $_POST['submit'] : '';
[16:34:47] <brass> NexHD most likely your button isn't called submit, or you left out the name="" attribute on the element, etc..
[16:34:48] <NexHD> i get this
[16:34:49] <NexHD> Array
[16:34:49] <NexHD> (
[16:34:49] <NexHD> )
[16:34:54] <NexHD> in my pag
[16:34:56] <NexHD> page*
[16:34:58] <dblosevn> although instead of '' id use false
[16:35:02] <dblosevn> then you didnt post anything
[16:35:16] <brass> maybe Get
[16:35:32] <brass> echo "<pre>"; print_r($_GET); exit;
[16:35:54] <dblosevn> im thinking he hasnt actually submitted his form he just loading the page
[16:36:00] <NexHD> same result
[16:36:03] <brass> if this isn't a asychronous call, what is the method="" attribute set as on the <form> tag?
[16:36:09] <brass> oh i see
[16:36:31] <brass> NexHD, sounds like you need to explain your process or what you're doing.
[16:37:30] <NexHD> just i want to execute the jquery page after hit the submit button
[16:37:39] <NexHD> sorry
[16:37:45] <dblosevn> wow...
[16:37:48] <NexHD> query code
[16:38:05] <NetTalk> i am trying to load the parent tab something like this... window.top.location.href+'#tab5' = window.top.location.href+'#tab5';
[16:38:06] <dblosevn> <form id="myform">
[16:38:10] <NetTalk> but it would seem to workl
[16:38:16] <NetTalk> i think there is syntax error
[16:38:50] <gowie> dblosevn cool I'll give that a shot, thanks.
[16:39:02] <andornaut> when I set focus() on a textarea, the cursor is positioned at the first char (chrome 22). Is there a good/modern way of moving the cursor position to the last char
[16:39:05] <andornaut> ?
[16:40:20] <dblosevn> $(function() { $('$myForm').submit(function() { $.post('myscript.php', $(this).serialize, function(ret) { code to execute on callback }); });
[16:40:52] <dblosevn> * $(this).serialize(),
[16:42:15] <dblosevn> sorry heres the proper code
[16:42:16] <dblosevn> $(function() { $('$myForm').submit(function() { $.post('myscript.php', $(this).serialize(), function(ret) { code to execute on callback }); return false; }); );
[16:42:47] <dblosevn> @andronaut think its selStart
[16:44:11] <NexHD> if i use this if($_REQUEST['submit']!="")  for excute code after hit submit button
[16:44:12] <NexHD> ?
[16:45:17] <dblosevn> still your not testing if $_REQUEST['submit'] isset your going to get that warning if its now
[16:45:28] <dblosevn> *not
[16:47:52] <dblosevn> @andronaut you can also reset the value of the textarea after focus and it will move the cursor to the end
[16:48:02] <NexHD> work with that
[16:48:14] <NexHD> he dont show me that errors
[16:48:26] <NexHD> notices*
[16:48:43] <dblosevn> eg... $('#conversa').focus().val($('#conversa').val());
[16:49:11] <dblosevn> @NexHD if (isset($_REQUEST['submit']))
[16:50:35] <ProLoser> any css savants in here?
[16:52:21] <dblosevn> @ProLoser depends on what you need
[16:55:05] <ProLoser> http://jsfiddle.net/ProLoser/hgk84/ I can't figure out why the list-style is completely fucked up and #css is filled with amateurs
[16:55:15] <NexHD> thanks you guys
[16:55:26] <NexHD> i have solved:)

[16:57:58] <brend_> gosh this dude knows a lot
[16:58:06] <NetTalk> i am trying to load the parent tab something like this... window.top.location.href+'#tab5' = window.top.location.href+'#tab5';
[16:58:08] <NetTalk> i think there is syntax error
[16:58:15] <NetTalk> but it would seem to work
[16:58:24] <NetTalk> it wouldnt seem to work *
[16:59:55] <dblosevn> @ProLoser What are you trying to get the list to look like?
[17:00:11] <ProLoser> like a normal list
[17:00:19] <ProLoser> with the fucking children blocked for unrelated purposes
[17:00:49] <tw2113> it looks like a list to me
[17:01:12] <batmanbond3d> ProLoser: Get rid of the display: block in your CSS
[17:01:33] <batmanbond3d> ProLoser: Let me know if that is what you are after
[17:03:22] <ProLoser> i need it for unrelated reasons
[17:03:47] * tw2113 still saw an ordered list 1-5
[17:04:01] <dblosevn> @ProLoser I removed input, select, span { display: block }
[17:04:08] <dblosevn> and the list looks as it should
[17:04:27] <dblosevn> if you need block level elements there, id use display: inline-block;
[17:05:35] <dblosevn> @ProLoser http://jsfiddle.net/hgk84/6/
[17:05:53] <ProLoser> blah nvm
[17:05:58] <ProLoser> i'll have to hack around it
[17:06:08] <dblosevn> or do you not want the numbers?
[17:06:47] <dblosevn> wow some peoples kids
[17:06:59] <batmanbond3d> lol
[17:08:01] <dblosevn> he probally just wanted ul instead of ol
[17:08:36] <tw2113> 10,000 li's when all you need is a p ?
[17:08:49] <tw2113> </webdevAlanis>
[17:09:25] <dblosevn> i prefer ul li for things like that
[17:09:44] <dblosevn> eaiser to float
[17:09:55] <dblosevn> for columns etc
[17:10:18] <dblosevn> back to my movie :-)
[17:12:18] <batmanbond3d> anyone want to take a look at a web app I'm building and give me a few suggestions?
[17:13:13] <batmanbond3d> http://66.131.121.129:8080/estm
[17:13:24] <batmanbond3d> username: tsapi password : Silanis1
[17:19:39] <brend__> wheres the guy that helped me out
[17:20:16] <tw2113> no idea
[17:20:21] <brend__> lol
[17:21:09] <aJacom> any reason why element.children('h3,p,h4.message-number').removeAttr("style"); wouldn't work ?
[17:22:44] <brass> batmanbond3d, does your company have a android app for signed doc generation?
[17:23:11] <brass> actually, it wouldn't matter. However do you guys have a web service?
[17:24:22] <batmanbond3d> yes, we have a web service
[17:25:48] <brend__> how can i set up the modal title in this code http://pastie.org/5059676
[17:25:55] <aJacom> question: i have var = $(element .class); when i make another element have .class, var  is going to reference it too. how can i make "var" just be what it was in the beginning and not change ?
[17:27:25] <batmanbond3d> brend__: add the attribute title in your div
[17:27:54] <brend__> batmanbond3d:  but that function is taking the content of the page only
[17:28:09] <batmanbond3d> so var outputHolder = $('<div id=".uimodal-output" title="Your Title"></div>');
[17:28:41] <brend__> batmanbond3d:  is kind of a general function.. works with different modals
[17:28:52] <batmanbond3d> this is assuming you are using jQuery UI
[17:32:41] <brend__> for some reason it brokes with the last suggestion
[17:33:21] <batmanbond3d> brend__: When you put title?
[17:33:34] <brend__> right
[17:34:38] <batmanbond3d> can you set something up on JSFiddle?
[17:36:55] <brend__> ok
[17:37:17] <brend__> damn why is this autoscrolling up automatically
[17:37:20] <dblosevn> this guy?
[17:37:44] <dblosevn> this guy == watching tv lol
[17:38:25] <coldhead> lol!
[17:39:05] <dblosevn> isnt title an attribute when calling modal
[17:39:10] <dblosevn> *dialog
[17:39:31] <batmanbond3d> aJacom: I don't think if you make another element have .class, it change the contents of var
[17:40:32] <batmanbond3d> dblosevn: setting title in the div attributes works for me with jQuery UI.
[17:40:35] <dblosevn> @brend_ http://pastebin.com/ES93Z4Ub
[17:40:55] <dblosevn> will set the title = to the a tags html
[17:42:47] <dblosevn> @batmanbond why go through all that when theres a title constructor in the create dialog call?
[17:43:15] <brend__> dblosevn:  so then i should set up title in <div id"form" title"hereisatitle">
[17:43:29] <batmanbond3d> dblosevn: guess you can do it both ways
[17:43:36] <dblosevn> oh you want the title attribute
[17:43:48] <dblosevn> i thought you wanted to change the title bar of the dialog
[17:43:55] <brend__> nop
[17:43:58] <brend__> the title name
[17:44:09] <dblosevn> well text in the title bar
[17:44:45] <dblosevn> id assign a title attribute to the a tag
[17:45:08] <dblosevn> and title: $(this).attr('title')
[17:45:12] <brend__> umm
[17:45:27] <dblosevn> on dialog creation
[17:45:48] <brend__> so i should add that in the function
[17:46:10] <dblosevn> sorry title: $this.attr('title')
[17:46:47] <dblosevn> like this http://pastebin.com/0f7W6QUZ
[17:47:15] <dblosevn> and add <a title="Title text you want on the dialog" href="..... to your html
[17:48:07] <dblosevn> you could also use rel= instead if you dont want the title attached to the a tag
[17:49:03] <NexHD> after a succes query how i prevent from reload put again the same query as first
[17:49:03] <NexHD> ?
[17:49:06] <brend__> let me see
[17:49:31] <dblosevn> return false in your submit handler
[17:49:37] <dblosevn> @NexHD
[17:50:08] <dblosevn> will stop the form form doing a real submit
[17:50:27] <dblosevn> the code I gave you for that earlier stops the submit from happening
[17:50:39] <dblosevn> and only does the ajax post
[17:51:56] <NexHD> i have that succes mesage with data sent to db...but if reload page the query will be again in the db
[17:51:56] <NexHD> ?
[17:52:53] <NexHD> will be a good ideea to redirect into a succes page ?
[17:53:17] <NexHD> now i store succes mesage in the same file
[17:53:23] <dblosevn> well... if your doing an ajax post generally you woudlnt redirect
[17:53:44] <dblosevn> if your going to redirect anyways you might as well do a standard post
[17:54:03] <dblosevn> ajax isnt always the best solution
[17:54:56] <NexHD> :)
[17:55:39] <brend__> dblosevn:  that worked.. same thing i should do to modify the size of the modal?
[17:56:21] <dblosevn> if the size is going to change i usually try to get away with letting it autosize
[17:57:17] <dblosevn> im proablly going to start getting booted a lot shortly, reconfiguring my network
[17:58:38] <dblosevn> you could also do something like this
[17:58:47] <brend__> excelent
[17:59:12] <brend__> dblosevn:  you are jquery god
[17:59:15] <dblosevn> rel="{title: 'Dialog title', width: 300, height: 150}"
[17:59:52] <brend__> dblosevn:  fixed that with 'auto'
[18:00:23] <dblosevn> then in your function do var attribs = exec('(' + $this.attr('rel') + ')');
[18:00:56] <dblosevn> title: attribs.title, width: attribs.width, height: attribs.height
[18:01:02] <brend__> dblosevn:  u can change the color of the header with that?
[18:01:34] <dblosevn> dont think so but you could store the color you want it to be in the orel object
[18:01:37] <dblosevn> *rel
[18:01:48] <dblosevn> ,color: '#FF0000'
[18:02:11] <dblosevn> and set the titlebars color to that with attribs.color
[18:02:37] <brend__> i see
[18:02:42] <brend__> cool
[18:04:36] <dblosevn> if your using php to generate the html you could do something like rel="<?=json_encode(array('title' => 'Your dialog title', color => '#FF0000', width => 300, height => 150))?>"
[18:05:43] <dblosevn> php >5.3 required for thaT
[18:05:48] <dblosevn> >=*
[18:05:55] <brend__> where im suppose to place that
[18:06:14] <dblosevn> in the code that generates your html
[18:06:27] <brend__> oh ok
[18:06:54] <dblosevn> will ensure your json is always valid in rel
[18:07:51] <dblosevn> <?= requires that short open tag be turned on in php as well if that doesnt work do <?php echo json_encode....
[18:08:02] <brend__> yes yes
[18:08:20] <brend__> awesome
[18:08:28] <dblosevn> im trying to tackle java now
[18:08:36] <dblosevn> building my first native android app
[18:08:54] <brend__> u finish it?
[18:09:00] <dblosevn> and next month on to objective c, so I can do ios
[18:09:09] <dblosevn> almost done with the rough draft
[18:09:22] <batmanbond3d> dblosevn: why not a javascript app and then call the browser in your mobile app?
[18:09:26] <brend__> dblosevn:  u work as a developer?
[18:09:39] <dblosevn> does almost everything i want to do, then im going to go back and pretty it up
[18:09:48] <dblosevn> i already build phonegap apps
[18:10:01] <dblosevn> which is just a native wrapper around html/javascript
[18:10:41] <dblosevn> I want to learn java and objective c next so I can build truly native andorid and ios apps
[18:11:19] <dblosevn> more money in native apps
[18:11:33] <dblosevn> they have to pay twice for andorid / ios
[18:11:37] <batmanbond3d> I wonder why people bother with object C
[18:11:39] <dblosevn> and yes I work as a developer
[18:11:55] <dblosevn> because its the language you develop ios apps in
[18:12:03] <brend__> i see.. im learning just as a hobby
[18:12:11] <batmanbond3d> if you have some CRUD app, building it in javascript/html works
[18:12:27] <dblosevn> ya but your limited to the html inputs etc
[18:12:37] <batmanbond3d> and if you are building something like a game, you can use C++, there is an object C call that lets you pass C++ code to it
[18:12:44] <dblosevn> native apps allow you to use the phones objects like date time listviews etc
[18:12:55] <brend__> the only way to upload files with ajax is with iframes or using some plugins like ajax upload?
[18:13:01] <dblosevn> no
[18:13:18] <batmanbond3d> that is what they did at GameLoft for all their game development
[18:13:19] <dblosevn> you must fallback to iframe if the browser doesnt support html5 upload
[18:13:47] <dblosevn> ya you can do that
[18:13:55] <brend__> im strugglin with that
[18:14:10] <dblosevn> the base app is objective c and theres librarys you can include to run pure c and c++
[18:14:22] <dblosevn> didnt I give you the solution to that earlier
[18:14:28] <dblosevn> @brend_
[18:14:50] <dblosevn> I found a really cool ajax uploader bout a year ago i use in a lot of my projects
[18:14:50] <brend__> with the file uploading?
[18:15:09] <dblosevn> does html5 upload and fallsback to iframe if not supported
[18:15:12] <brend__> dblosevn:  which is?
[18:15:19] <batmanbond3d> when doing file upload with iframes, is it possible to parse the header of the response returned into the iframe, like check if the status is 404 or something like that?
[18:15:20] <dblosevn> doesnt require flash or any other external lib
[18:15:41] <dblosevn> and does muti file with progress
[18:15:51] <dblosevn> let me find the link again
[18:15:54] <brend__> dblosevn:  pass it
[18:17:58] <dblosevn> http://www.albanx.com/
[18:18:15] <dblosevn> says old and obsolete but it still works in all the latest browsers
[18:18:58] <dblosevn> just used it recently on a wordpress plugin i wrote to upload a movie, render it thumbnail it and upload the finished files to amazon
[18:19:25] <dblosevn> with status for every action
[18:19:29] <brend__> dblosevn:  seems to be easy to implement also
[18:19:36] <dblosevn> ya
[18:19:48] <dblosevn> only thing that kind of sucks about it is you have to write your upload code twice
[18:20:00] <dblosevn> once for standard upload
[18:20:05] <dblosevn> once for ajax upload
[18:20:11] <brend__> yes thats what im seeing
[18:20:19] <rend> https://github.com/pazooki/mindlogger/blob/master/static/js/init.js  here, it does load jquery.cookie.js, but somehow csrf.js don't get access to use its function $.cookie
[18:20:22] <rend> why is that?
[18:20:23] <dblosevn> as the ajax upload streams the file to the server in 1mb chunks
[18:21:21] <dblosevn> so the ajax service actually gets called multiple times on the ajax upload for one file
[18:21:31] <dblosevn> which is how you get progress
[18:22:14] <brend__> yap
[18:22:49] <dblosevn> @rend maybe its doing jQuery.noConflict try jQuery.cookie
[18:23:00] <dblosevn> instead of $.cookie
[18:23:19] <rend> ok
[18:24:11] <rend> dblosevn: TypeError: jQuery.cookie is not a function
[18:25:14] <brend__> well im kinda tired of watching the screen.. will see if i get some sleep.. thanks for the help dblosevn
[18:25:54] <dblosevn> np @brend_
[18:26:03] <dblosevn> maybe ill get bored another day and come back lol
[18:26:38] <brend__> dblosevn: u should be here all days..
[18:26:41] <brend__> lol
[18:26:52] <dblosevn> id neever make any money lmao
[18:27:09] <brend__> yeah i know
[18:27:10] <brend__> haha
[18:27:11] <dblosevn> @rend the only other thing I can think is that csrf is loading before jquery
[18:27:42] <dblosevn> the way your queuing your scripts its quite possible for the 4th script to load before the first
[18:28:53] <dblosevn> look at your log and see what order the scripts are logged in
[18:30:37] <dblosevn> @rend are they logged in order?
[18:30:58] <dblosevn> jquery, cookie, csrf, hendler
[18:31:06] <rend> no
[18:31:10] <rend> I'm sure it's after that
[18:32:00] <dblosevn> if csrf loads before cookie $.cookie will not be defined
[18:32:36] <dblosevn> what i would do is actually queue the scripts
[18:44:24] <Shadow> Hi, can anyone help me get the reset button working, please http://jsfiddle.net/NYH4H/1/
[18:44:58] <dblosevn> @rend something like this http://pastebin.com/37HX1vZf
[18:45:47] <dblosevn> @rend totally untested but looks like it would work out of the box
[18:46:28] <Shadow> dblosevn: any chance you could take a look at my question, please.
[18:46:45] <dblosevn> ya i was grabbing a smoke lol
[18:47:48] <Bankzilla> Anyone know the name of a horizontal accordion that can take up an entire page (height wise). Currently trying to get liteAccordion to work but without hacking at the code it seems impossible
[18:48:50] <dblosevn> @shadow reading your code
[18:48:57] <rend> dblosevn: I think the problem is server side
[18:49:37] <dblosevn> @rend the first step would be to check the console log make sure its logging all the modules loaded and in order
[18:49:58] <dblosevn> if a moduel is missing check the net tab for 404
[18:50:25] <dblosevn> if there out of order try to implement a queue like the one i wrote for you
[18:50:44] <dblosevn> if there all being included in order its just weird
[18:51:15] <dblosevn> does it work if you use script tags instead of injecting them into the dom
[18:51:35] <dblosevn> if so its a problem with the include order
[18:51:49] <rend> dblosevn: I get [14/Oct/2012 20:51:00] "GET /static/js/init.js HTTP/1.1" 304 0
[18:52:03] <dblosevn> when you append scripts to the dom like that they are loaded async
[18:52:20] <dblosevn> when the script tags exist in the html they are loaded syncronous
[18:52:30] <Shadow> dblosevn: Why does it say "ReferenceError: Ireland is not defined". http://jsfiddle.net/NYH4H/2/
[18:54:31] <rend> dblosevn: which one is better? async right?
[18:54:58] <dblosevn> well async is a problem in this case
[18:55:22] <dblosevn> if script 2 loads before script 1 and script 1 is jquery then jquery is undefined
[18:56:42] <rend> oh shit right
[18:56:51] <rend> dblosevn: but I also tried <script> tag
[18:57:13] <dblosevn> @Shadow im not getting that error although Ireland is not right the node with value Select Country
[18:57:31] <dblosevn> with the script tags in the html jQuery.cookie is still undefined?
[18:57:34] <dblosevn> @rend
[18:57:50] <rend> I didn't try that
[18:57:57] <rend> but I'm sure async isn't the problem
[18:58:05] <rend> and that gets loaded before csrf
[18:58:15] <dblosevn> if putting the scripts in hte html fixes it, async is the problem
[18:58:26] <dblosevn> jquery.cookie is smallery then jquery so it will load faster
[18:58:50] <dblosevn> if csrf is smaller then cookie then it could load before cookie
[18:58:51] <dblosevn> etc
[18:59:17] <Shadow> dblosevn: should I not be using the value 'Ireland'
[18:59:30] <dblosevn> you should make a new option for Ireland
[18:59:54] <coldhead> i'm sure the irish will appreciate that
[19:00:09] <dblosevn> http://jsfiddle.net/NYH4H/3/
[19:00:19] <dblosevn> @coldhead :-D
[19:00:20] <Shadow> I what it to reset to 'Select a County'
[19:06:01] <Shadow> dblosevn: even with the update you made I still get "ReferenceError: Ireland is not defined", when I click Reset
[19:09:25] <brass> dblosevn, you should probably start writing up the invoices for todays work :P
[19:22:36] <dblosevn> @brass i know right
[19:22:45] <dblosevn> @rend i dont like dropkick lmao
[19:23:22] <dblosevn> @brass i leach off of other peops code all the time so everyonce in a while i give back
[19:23:45] <dblosevn> doesnt appear dropkick updates the related select on change
[19:24:20] <Shadow> dblosevn: any idea how I can get that to work
[19:27:21] <dblosevn> @rend i see the code in the plugin to update the select but it doesnt actually appear to work
[19:31:03] <brass> dblosevn, i hear ya.
[19:36:49] <dblosevn> @rend you owe me like at least 100 bux
[19:36:52] <dblosevn> lmao
[19:36:54] <dblosevn> @rend http://jsfiddle.net/NYH4H/4/
[19:38:35] <dblosevn> damn it doesn fire change though
[19:39:00] <Shadow> dblosevn: is that for me
[19:42:55] <dblosevn> @rend this one works properly http://jsfiddle.net/NYH4H/6/
[19:43:19] <dblosevn> oh shit lol @Shadow

[20:33:09] <thx-1138> can anyone tell my why this ajax call for jsonp keeps triggering "error" but contains "success"?  http://jsfiddle.net/bUtak/embedded/result/
[20:38:01] <black_warlock> carefull at the version
[20:38:45] <Eviltwin> thx-1138: Try opening http://api.tiresync.com/v1/oe/makes/1111-1111-1111-1111/d3d3LnRoZWNteHNvbHV0aW9uLmNvbQ==/2006/callback?callback=jQuery18207684034900739789_1350272245194&_=1350272248428 in a browser
[20:42:44] <thx-1138> Eviltwin thanks, i did, and it appears to be a valid jsonp
[20:43:02] <thx-1138> um, except for the unhandled error...
[20:43:16] <thx-1138> rechecking
[20:45:47] <Eviltwin> I don't see a function call, I see a string
[20:46:09] <thx-1138> okay so here's the thing
[20:46:42] <thx-1138> this api will return jsonp if the url is constructed this way, which i'm thinking jquery doesn't do...    http://api.tiresync.com/v1/oe/makes/1111-1111-1111-1111/d3d3LnRoZWNteHNvbHV0aW9uLmNvbQ==/2006/callback
[20:48:03] <dblosevn> found the problem
[20:48:20] <Eviltwin> thx-1138: Please read this for more info about how jQuery specifies a callback: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[20:48:25] <dblosevn> jquery is requesting http://api.tiresync.com/v1/oe/makes/1111-1111-1111-1111/d3d3LnRoZWNteHNvbHV0aW9uLmNvbQ==/2006/callback?callback=jQuery18206791012634057552_1350272402684&_=1350272543863
[20:48:31] <Eviltwin> You're probably going to need to override the behavior
[20:48:39] <dblosevn> when the script expects http://api.tiresync.com/v1/oe/makes/1111-1111-1111-1111/d3d3LnRoZWNteHNvbHV0aW9uLmNvbQ==/2006/callback=jQuery18206791012634057552_1350272402684&_=1350272543863
[20:49:55] <dblosevn> when you remove ?callback= from the url it returns a result with the proper callback function name
[20:51:38] <dblosevn> a quick dirty fix would be to write a onbefore request listener and url.replace('?callback=', '')
[20:52:40] <thx-1138> let me try that
[20:52:59] <thx-1138> tried using the working url and setting jsonp: false
[20:53:04] <thx-1138> but it didn't like that
[20:54:12] <dblosevn> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ beforeSend
[20:54:49] <dblosevn> I can see the result when formatted as I mentioned
[20:55:05] <dblosevn> with the proper callback function
[20:56:10] <thx-1138> is there somewhere i can get more detail on the beforesend syntax?  doesn't seem to say much here other than the params are jqxhr, settings
[20:59:36] <thx-1138> I see here you can put a function call right on the param line, which is good.   but how do i access the string given in the url param?   or do i have to pass it in to the function at the top and just access it that way?
[21:00:31] <black_warlock> Eviltwin http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/xyRrF/2/
[21:00:57] <black_warlock> how can i set the button btw <li> --- here ---<a
[21:05:26] <dblosevn> http://jsfiddle.net/w3bGr/
[21:05:31] <dblosevn> Mine works :-D
[21:06:54] <black_warlock> nobody knows ?
[21:06:55] <thx-1138> ???
[21:06:58] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: I'm not sure what you're asking
[21:07:16] <thx-1138> dblosevn i pulled up your link and still got a fail on the alert
[21:07:22] <black_warlock> the button actually appear before the <li>
[21:07:34] <black_warlock> need it inside the li and before the link
[21:07:34] <dblosevn> I got the callback to work, and success fires
[21:07:55] <Eviltwin> $("a").prev("button") ?
[21:08:16] <dblosevn> I get success and data
[21:08:29] <thx-1138> is this maybe a browser issue then?  hmm
[21:08:48] <dblosevn> except not on please select oviously
[21:09:04] <dblosevn> i get failure on that
[21:09:13] <thx-1138> ah
[21:09:21] <dblosevn> brb buffers too full i think
[21:09:38] <thx-1138> on the api server?
[21:09:50] <dblosevn> wasnt scrolling anymore
[21:09:59] <dblosevn> im using chrome latest
[21:10:12] <thx-1138> same here
[21:10:13] <brend__> back again
[21:10:26] <black_warlock> hum no Eviltwin
[21:10:31] <thx-1138> what did you do, strip out everything but the script?
[21:10:39] <JonahSchulte> For those of you in a time zone where it's 10/15/2012, check out http://www.google.com/ — awesome doodle today.
[21:11:11] <dblosevn> oh thats not my code
[21:11:22] <brend__> umm
[21:11:37] <brend__> getting issues with ajax
[21:11:41] <dblosevn> forgot to update i just ran it
[21:11:42] <dblosevn> http://jsfiddle.net/w3bGr/1/
[21:12:19] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: You're being rather vague about what you're trying to do
[21:12:20] <thx-1138> fuckin a
[21:12:40] <thx-1138> dblosevn is there somewhere i can get better examples of some of these $.ajax() params?
[21:12:40] <dblosevn> just tested chrome firefox safari and ie all work
[21:12:57] <dblosevn> :-D
[21:13:06] <thx-1138> on jquery.com its just hey the params are jqxhr, settings, i would have never guessed from that what "settings" meant
[21:13:13] <dblosevn> I got that jrom jquery docs
[21:13:25] <dblosevn> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[21:13:39] <dblosevn> ya
[21:13:48] <dblosevn> I debugged it and looked at the settings object
[21:14:16] <thx-1138> ohhhhh so its "settings" from the ajax param itself
[21:14:20] <dblosevn> yes
[21:14:33] <thx-1138> learn something new every day
[21:14:35] <dblosevn> which you can play with before the resuets is made
[21:14:41] <thx-1138> yup
[21:14:45] <thx-1138> the rest is very clear
[21:14:50] <thx-1138> wtf is up with this api
[21:14:54] <thx-1138> why would they do that
[21:15:09] <dblosevn> no clue i didnt write the docs lol
[21:15:25] <dblosevn> @brend_ back again lol
[21:16:22] <brend__> was listening pj
[21:16:38] <rbedi99> hey, question about .val(): i'm trying to get the value of a textarea on a buttonclick and replace the contents of the div with the contents of the textarea, but it isnt working and i cant figure out why for the life of me. code here: http://pastebin.com/5q18ms72 thanks in advance!
[21:16:43] <JonahSchulte> Can someone summarize what is it about http://jsfiddle.net/w3bGr/1/ that isn't working right now?
[21:16:51] <dblosevn> @brend_ i saw you say something earlier but had to leave and come back? you figure it out?
[21:16:54] <black_warlock> anyone knows how to put the <button> between <li> and <a> tags ?
[21:16:56] <thx-1138> dblosevn but okay thats not normal to you too right?  i mean wtf lol
[21:17:18] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/xyRrF/12/
[21:17:41] <dblosevn> I know right, I use the docs for a reference to get halfway where i need to be and debug the rest
[21:17:41] <brend__> oh
[21:17:42] <brend__> yes
[21:17:49] <brend__> dblosevn:  following the function gave me to opend dialogs.. this should be good to send the data out
[21:18:06] <dblosevn> @black_warlock via dom?
[21:18:06] <brend__> http://pastie.org/5060296
[21:18:33] <black_warlock> just the first a
[21:18:41] <black_warlock> before the first <a>
[21:18:46] <dblosevn> so you have <li><a>
[21:19:00] <black_warlock> yes
[21:19:05] <dblosevn> and you want to inject a <button> inbetween eg ... li button a
[21:19:13] <black_warlock> y
[21:19:17] <dblosevn> 2 secs
[21:19:42] <JonahSchulte> Hi rbedi99, I made a jsfiddle for your question: http://jsfiddle.net/jschulte/eDF49/
[21:20:25] <dblosevn> $('liselector').prepend(but);
[21:20:36] <dblosevn> var but = $('<button/>');$('liselector').prepend(but);
[21:21:17] <brend__> guess should be good
[21:21:22] <black_warlock> but did you see fiddle ?
[21:21:29] <dblosevn> where liselector is is the selector
[21:21:31] <dblosevn> link me?
[21:21:46] <black_warlock> dblosevn http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/xyRrF/12/
[21:22:34] <JonahSchulte> You still there rbedi99?
[21:22:40] <rbedi99> JonahSchulte:  yessir!
[21:22:55] <dblosevn> @brend_ give me a sec
[21:22:56] <JonahSchulte> ok, it looks like your code has a dependency that we can't see with what you posted
[21:23:01] <JonahSchulte>     $.post('update_maintext.php', { maintext: thistext } );
[21:23:05] <JonahSchulte> don't have that php
[21:23:38] <brend__> no prob
[21:23:42] <JonahSchulte> that just sets "var maintext" to the value of "thistext" ?
[21:23:47] <JonahSchulte> so we could fake it for now
[21:23:54] <black_warlock> it must contains an update query ......
[21:23:57] <rbedi99> JonahSchulte:  http://pastebin.com/xY7syZWc
[21:24:27] <rbedi99> JonahSchulte: but i dont think thats the problem because it works fine when i set thistext equal to something random
[21:24:38] <rbedi99> JonahSchulte:  thanks for the jsfiddle- nifty.
[21:25:19] <dblosevn> @black_warlock it apears to be prepending the button
[21:25:22] <JonahSchulte> rbedi99: I think this would work for you: http://jsfiddle.net/jschulte/vQLUT/
[21:25:30] <black_warlock> i know
[21:25:38] <black_warlock> it is outside
[21:25:43] <black_warlock> of <li>
[21:25:54] <black_warlock> but need it inside it and before of <a>
[21:26:00] <dblosevn> or am i missing something?
[21:26:04] <thx-1138> dblosevn tell me about this line tmp = tmp.replace(/&_.*$/, '');
[21:26:20] <thx-1138> is that just to replace any odd chars left over?
[21:26:33] <rbedi99> JonahSchulte: so i can pull the contents of the textarea without .val or anything?
[21:26:42] <dblosevn> got ya
[21:26:55] <dblosevn> 2 secs thx
[21:27:21] <dblosevn> @black_warlock http://jsfiddle.net/xyRrF/18/
[21:27:24] <JonahSchulte> rbedi99: I…guess so :)
[21:27:29] <dblosevn>  $('li a').parent().prepend('<button align=\"absmiddle\">+</button>');
[21:27:48] <rbedi99> JonahSchulte: interesting! thanks!
[21:28:12] <JonahSchulte> Srue!
[21:28:14] <JonahSchulte> and also, Sure!
[21:28:30] <JonahSchulte> I would have though you'd need to use .val() too
[21:28:37] <JonahSchulte> but I guess you can just specify the selector
[21:29:48] <dblosevn> @thx-1138 the problem I had was not only was jQuery adding ?callback= to the url it was also adding &_=random string which the service was appending to the callback name, so I wrote a regex to match starting with &_ to the end of the line and replace with nothing
[21:30:25] <thx-1138> dear lord what is someone with your skillz doing on irc lol
[21:30:41] <black_warlock> hum
[21:30:50] <black_warlock> its missing something there
[21:31:00] <dblosevn> @black_warlock that what you were looking for?
[21:31:01] <brend__> thanks god we have this dude
[21:31:26] <black_warlock> missing the li has ul dblosevn
[21:31:39] <thx-1138> so &_ is the start of the needle string, . is the concatenator, * is wildcard after that, and $ means to the end of line?
[21:31:51] <thx-1138> my regex is rusty
[21:31:52] <black_warlock> infact on the second level it jumped the 2nd ul
[21:34:11] <black_warlock> aff
[21:34:13] <black_warlock> its this one
[21:34:23] <black_warlock> $('li:has(ul,div) a').before('<button align=\"absmiddle\">+</button>');
[21:35:19] <dblosevn> $thx-1138 you got it :-)
[21:35:45] <black_warlock> ok tks done dblosevn
[21:36:03] <dblosevn> im looking at the code, it appears theres no a tags on the second level
[21:37:45] <thx-1138> dblosevn you are el hombre
[21:37:56] <brend__> jaja
[21:37:59] <dblosevn> http://jsfiddle.net/xyRrF/29/
[21:38:00] <brend__> sabe una bola
[21:38:26] <black_warlock> infact
[21:38:26] <dblosevn> um ya im a dude and no i dont speak spanish although i do live in south florida
[21:39:11] <dblosevn> what irc server is this, i need to get a real client
[21:39:19] <brend__> its easy
[21:39:24] <Klowner> dblosevn: freenode
[21:39:40] <dblosevn> im using some java wrapped up pos irc client
[21:39:42] <brend__> damn ajax request
[21:40:46] <rbedi99> JonahSchulte:  still having some trouble-- i cant seem to get the contents of the textarea into a variable, which i need to post and such
[21:41:28] <rbedi99> JonahSchulte: doesnt work with or without the val() selector
[21:42:05] <dblosevn> whats your selector look like?
[21:42:18] <dblosevn> and does your textarea have an id @rbed
[21:42:48] <rbedi99> dblosevn: var texttosend = $('#textupdate').val();
[21:42:54] <brend__> for some reason im being posted randomly with both modals using ajax
[21:42:55] <rbedi99> dblosevn: and yeah, the textarea's id is set to textupdate
[21:43:47] <dblosevn> alert($('#textupdate').val());
[21:43:56] <brass> dblosevn: you'll have to pm me your contact info, we would work well together on some commercial jobs
[21:44:46] <rbedi99> dblosevn: no dice- alert comes up empty
[21:44:52] <black_warlock> tired gnight people
[21:44:55] <black_warlock> thanks
[21:47:56] <dblosevn> much better
[21:48:00] <dblosevn> real client lmao
[21:48:33] <dblosevn> what was I doing again lol lost my train of thought
[21:48:36] <rbedi99> dblosevn: haha, always good. alert statement came up empty
[21:48:53] <dblosevn> let me see the html for your textarea
[21:49:40] <rbedi99> dblosevn: 	<textarea id="textupdate"><?php echo $maintext; ?></textarea>
[21:49:51] <brend__> weird
[21:49:58] <dblosevn> that should work
[21:50:15] <dblosevn> pastebin me the js
[21:50:24] <chare> how do I build on $('#analysis span:nth-child(' + i + ')') to replace the nth child
[21:50:29] <chare> with something else
[21:51:00] <rbedi99> dblosevn: http://pastebin.com/KHbLLiu3
[21:51:02] <dblosevn> remove nthchild prepend new
[21:51:30] <dblosevn> *after  nth minus 1 append child
[21:51:31] <rbedi99> i know the alert is working because if i set texttosend manually = "test", "test" shows in the alert
[21:51:49] <FriendlyLumberja> can't you just .replaceWith()?
[21:52:01] <rbedi99> FriendlyLumberja: is that directed to me?
[21:52:06] <FriendlyLumberja> yeah
[21:52:11] <rbedi99> i need it in a variable to post it
[21:52:17] <dblosevn> or easier .replaceWith(new node);
[21:52:42] <FriendlyLumberja> Oh whoops rbedi99 no it wasnt, sorry
[21:52:59] <dblosevn> @chare  $('#analysis span:nth-child(' + i + ')').replaceWith(newnode);
[21:53:03] <rbedi99> haha okay i was confused for a sec haha
[21:53:17] <rbedi99> eek, double "haha"s, its getting late
[21:53:40] <dblosevn> @FriendlyLumberja ya mind wasnt catching up to my keyboard
[21:54:03] <FriendlyLumberja> are you certain your echo $maintext; is outputting something?
[21:54:31] <rbedi99> FriendlyLumberja:  its supposed to be empty - i want texttosend to take on the value of what the user types into the textarea
[21:54:59] <rbedi99> its there so that the next time the user comes to the page, whatever he typed previously is displayed as the default textarea text (thats why i want it as a variable, so i can post and store it)
[21:55:29] <dblosevn> far easier is to just build a standard form and attach to the submit
[21:55:51] <dblosevn> then get your vars with $(this).serialize()
[21:56:53] <dblosevn> $('form').submit(function() { $.post('url', $(this).serialize(), function (ret) { }, 'json'); return false;);
[21:57:10] <FriendlyLumberja> rbedi99: I can't see why your alert would be empty unless your textarea was also empty
[21:57:16] <rbedi99> dblosevn: ahh interesting; thanks! will play with that.
[21:57:19] <rbedi99> FriendlyLumberja: me neither :(
[21:57:24] <dblosevn> ditto
[21:57:40] <rbedi99> i definitely typed stuff into the textarea, lol
[21:57:53] <dblosevn> oooo
[21:57:55] <dblosevn> i know
[21:57:55] <rbedi99> its a weird textarea... it also wont recognize spaces
[21:58:05] <dblosevn> you got another element on the page with the same id?
[21:58:10] <rbedi99> not that i can find
[21:58:20] <brend__> why im being posted randomly with both modals using ajax
[21:58:30] <rbedi99> i ctrl+f'ed for "textupdate" and nothing else came up
[21:58:32] <brend__> this is really weird
[21:58:38] <dblosevn> wow dude soorry @brend_
[21:58:44] <dblosevn> forgot
[21:58:48] <dblosevn> link me again
[21:58:58] <brend__> no worries
[21:59:10] <brend__> im trying to use my brain too
[21:59:11] <FriendlyLumberja> works for me in jsfiddle rbedi99 :/
[21:59:25] <brend__> http://pastie.org/5060296
[21:59:44] <rbedi99> FriendlyLumberja: gah.
[21:59:46] <FriendlyLumberja> http://jsfiddle.net/S8r9T/ @ rbedi99
[22:00:21] <dblosevn> @brend_ is it posting at all?
[22:00:43] <rbedi99> FriendlyLumberja: thats exactly what i have, and no diceee.
[22:01:08] <dblosevn> pastebin me the html on that page
[22:01:24] <rbedi99> dblosevn: who?
[22:01:26] <dblosevn> rbedi99:
[22:01:26] <FriendlyLumberja> rbedi99: do you have code that disables/otherwise hides that textarea before the alert?
[22:01:42] <brend__> dblosevn:  is posting.. but i have 2 modals.. using the function u gave me to show them up.. now when i want to submit sometimes happens that one is posting the other one
[22:01:43] <rbedi99> FriendlyLumberja: nope. the entire div is being brought up in a shadowbox, though
[22:02:03] <brend__> ok
[22:02:04] <dblosevn> oh, probally using the same callbacks
[22:02:11] <dblosevn> brend__:
[22:02:15] <brend__> yes
[22:02:26] <dblosevn> let me see the source for both modals and the callbacks
[22:02:50] <dblosevn> brend__: sorry trying to get used to this irc client havent used it before
[22:03:09] <brend__> ok
[22:03:44] <dblosevn> brend__: I think I know the problem but have to see it so i can tell you how to fix it
[22:03:56] <brend__> OK
[22:04:43] <dblosevn> brend__: both your forms most likely  have the same id so your selaizing the first form or the callbacks are overriding each other
[22:05:26] <brend__> dblosevn:  right.. but shouldnt be a problem if they are in different pages right?
[22:05:45] <dblosevn> different pages or different modals on the same page?
[22:06:27] <dblosevn> brend__: just because the modal is closed doesnt mean it has been removed from the dom, it still exists its just not visible
[22:06:45] <brend__> http://pastie.org/5060426
[22:07:15] <brend__> i know what u mean
[22:07:18] <dblosevn> brend__: so the second time you call to open a modal it #form pulls the first modals form and submit listener
[22:07:45] <brend__> thats right dblosevn
[22:08:10] <brend__> i need one different function per modal i call right?
[22:08:34] <brend__> i wanted to do it generic
[22:09:46] <dblosevn> no
[22:09:56] <dblosevn> you can use the same contorller the way you did it
[22:10:16] <dblosevn> but right before you close your modal do $('#form').remove
[22:10:18] <dblosevn> ();
[22:10:21] <brend__> what do i need to change then?
[22:10:55] <dblosevn> that will remove the form from the dom
[22:10:57] <brend__> ok
[22:11:01] <brend__> in the success?
[22:11:11] <dblosevn> so when the next modal is opened theres still only one form with the id form
[22:11:18] <brend__> sorru
[22:11:30] <brend__> before send: $('#form').remove
[22:11:31] <dblosevn> thats where i would put it but i didnt see any thing in success that closes the modal
[22:11:42] <dblosevn> id put it in the success
[22:11:44] <brend__> damn
[22:11:49] <brend__> ok
[22:12:16] <dblosevn> $('#form').remove();
[22:12:30] <brend__> let me see in success
[22:12:32] <dblosevn> hit enter when i was going for the shift key
[22:13:47] <brend__> eww
[22:14:01] <brend__> something broked with that lol
[22:14:35] <brend__> i got a little modal with nothing inside when i hit submit
[22:16:34] <dblosevn> brend__: http://pastebin.com/t1r6kZ2h
[22:18:51] <brend__> dblosevn:  im still having the issue   =/
[22:19:08] <dblosevn> that should have killed the modal alltogether
[22:20:00] <brend__> when i go to add_users it posted me add_addresses
[22:20:44] <dblosevn> $('.uimodal-output').fadeOut('slow', function () { $(this).remove());
[22:20:51] <dblosevn> thats what that line should look like
[22:21:44] <brend__> lets see
[22:21:46] <dblosevn> are you loading bothmodals at once?
[22:22:13] <dblosevn> grr $('.uimodal-output').fadeOut('slow', function () { $(this).remove()});
[22:22:20] <dblosevn> missed a curly brace
[22:22:21] <brend__> last one?
[22:22:55] <azbyin> hi all.. the new api docs for jquery1.9 are a bit confusing
[22:23:22] <dblosevn> azbyin: and lol
[22:23:22] <azbyin> within the accordionchange event, how do I get the current active panel as a 0-based  value?
[22:23:38] <azbyin> dblosevn, ?
[22:24:01] <dblosevn> jquery ui docs have always been horrible lol
[22:24:19] <azbyin> ok, then the newer ones are worse than crap
[22:24:28] <brend__> agree
[22:24:40] <brend__> dblosevn:  damn doesnt want to work
[22:26:13] <brend__> gosh
[22:26:34] <dblosevn> azbyin: give me a sec
[22:26:47] <dblosevn> brend__: dont know whats wrong ill have to think on it a bit
[22:27:37] <azbyin> .bin("accordionchange", function(event, ui){ console.log(ui.options.active); }); is what i have used previously with jqui1.8.x
[22:27:43] <azbyin> .bind, grr
[22:28:00] <brend__> umm
[22:33:55] <dblosevn> azbyin: http://jsfiddle.net/vJedC/2/
[22:34:34] <brend__> dblosevn:  so i guess the modals are still not being removed from the dom
[22:34:55] <dblosevn> azbyin: theres an example that gets the panel index, it seems the index itself is not stored in the object but I found a way to get it
[22:35:09] <azbyin> lol, are they going backwards?
[22:35:22] <dblosevn> no starts with 0
[22:35:30] <azbyin> wasn;t always having access to the index a good thing?
[22:35:43] <dblosevn> hey i didnt write it lol
[22:35:57] <dblosevn> you can get everything else just not the panel index
[22:36:48] <dblosevn> brend_ got an idea
[22:37:02] <azbyin> so they either want you to (a) do the id replacement trick you used or (b) get the header and then compare it against your stored list of headers to determine which panel was activated?
[22:37:08] <brend__> tell me
[22:37:39] <rbedi99> FriendlyLumberja: if youre still around & are curious, i figured it out - problem was the shadowbox. apparently when it copies html, elements with IDs no longer retain them because an ID is supposed to be unique on a page
[22:37:49] <azbyin> dblosevn, isnt there a way to simply access the options within the accordionchange event handler?
[22:37:58] <FriendlyLumberja> that's an odd one
[22:38:10] <azbyin> previously was as simple as ui.options
[22:38:29] <rbedi99> FriendlyLumberja:  yeaa. fixed it by passing the html directly into the Shadowbox call, rather than using jquery's .html()
[22:38:44] <dblosevn> brend__: http://pastebin.com/nXXd6U7N
[22:39:52] <dblosevn> rbedi99: ya you can rarely use .html() once you run a plugin on a div as the plugin will replace the div with the plugin
[22:39:56] <brend__> dblosevn:  what have u changed there?
[22:40:30] <dblosevn> brend__: i removed the ids from the forms and passed a reference to thee form into the submit listener
[22:41:04] <dblosevn> so the listener will always be bound to the right form
[22:41:24] <rbedi99> dblosevn: ahh good to know, thanks!
[22:42:22] <dblosevn> rbedi99: if you drilled dwon into the shadow box you could have found the correct element to set the html on however
[22:42:44] <rbedi99> dblosevn: whats weird is that when i inspected the element, the id hadnt changed deep inside the shadowbox
[22:43:04] <dblosevn> brend__: that work?
[22:43:28] <dblosevn> rbedi99: ya proper plugins just wrap the orginal node
[22:43:48] <rbedi99> dblosevn: oh i see- so where could i find the right element?
[22:43:53] <dblosevn> sometimes they duplicate it though so there may have been 2 nodes with the same id and you were setting the text to the wrong one
[22:44:37] <dblosevn> otheritmes the orginal node still exists but is display:none and they copy the node contents into there own wrapper
[22:45:07] <brend__> dblosevn:  guess i should removed $(form)[0].reset();
[22:45:10] <dblosevn> easiest fix for that is to add a wrapper around the content, and shadowbox that
[22:45:30] <dblosevn> hey im not doing the whole thing for you lol not even sure what its supossed to do
[22:45:53] <dblosevn> but that should have cleared the active formk after submit
[22:46:22] <brend__> yeah i know im saying that cuz its saying  TypeError: $(form)[0] is undefined
[22:46:27] <dblosevn> oh
[22:46:35] <dblosevn> it should be
[22:46:40] <dblosevn> form.reset();
[22:46:45] <brend__> ok
[22:47:23] <dblosevn> just had to walk away from it for a few lol
[22:47:51] <rbedi99> dblosevn: ah, okay. is there a way in html to specify a specific node? thanks for all the explanation!
[22:47:52] <brend__> TypeError: form is undefined
[22:48:00] <dblosevn> hmm
[22:48:01] <brend__> god damn
[22:48:08] <dblosevn> should exist in the scope
[22:48:30] <brend__> im getting an alert with the html
[22:48:37] <brend__> instead of the message
[22:50:18] <dblosevn>  brend__: http://pastie.org/5060528
[22:50:41] <dblosevn> your alerting the response from your post your post must be returning html
[22:52:06] <brend__> theform is undefined
[22:52:15] <brend__> 	  theform.reset();
[22:52:28] <dblosevn> rbedi99: do this <div id="outerwrapper"><div id="therealwrapper">content</div></div> and shadowbox the outerwrapper
[22:52:59] <dblosevn> brend__: ya, i scoped theform locally that should work
[22:53:00] <rbedi99> dblosevn: ooh, then shadowbox wont change the node references of the inner elements? cool. thanks!
[22:53:35] <dblosevn> rbedi99: you got it :-D
[22:53:48] <brend__> i mean thats what the browser says
[22:54:21] <dblosevn> brend__: i odnt understand what your saying
[22:54:46] <brend__> that is still not posting
[22:55:08] <dblosevn> brend__: explain not posting
[22:56:20] <brend__> i press submit and im being posted to home.php instead of add_users and the browser says TypeError: theform is undefined [Parar en este error] 	  theform.reset();
[22:56:40] <dblosevn> a real post?
[22:56:44] <dblosevn> or ajax post
[22:56:47] <brend__> ajax
[22:57:17] <brend__> 1st time i get with something so weird
[22:58:15] <dblosevn> brend__: 	alert(uri); before $.ajax
[22:59:16] <brend__> dblosevn:  i get undefined
[22:59:23] <brend__> "undefined"
[22:59:26] <dblosevn> did you update the html with my changes?
[22:59:41] <dblosevn> <form class="form-horizontal" action="addresses/add_addresses.php" onsubmit="return enviarForm(this); return false" method="post">
[22:59:51] <brend__> exactly like that
[23:00:02] <brend__> removed all ids
[23:00:08] <dblosevn> added this
[23:00:17] <dblosevn>  enviarForm(this);
[23:01:12] <brend__> ok
[23:01:14] <dblosevn> you have to pass a reference to the form to the function
[23:01:23] <dblosevn> sounds like your not
[23:01:51] <dblosevn>  enviarForm(this); change that on both forms and try again
[23:02:02] <azbyin> dblosevn, lol, i got it working.. http://jsbin.com/ovilit/1/
[23:02:38] <brend__> then i should do var theform = this;   var datos = $(this).serialize();  ?
[23:03:16] <azbyin> that new ui parameter is completely useless
[23:03:28] <dblosevn> azbyin: ya that works too
[23:03:44] <dblosevn> i didnt even see a reference to that event i used activate
[23:04:00] <dblosevn> no
[23:04:08] <dblosevn> not this.... form just like i have it
[23:04:21] <brend__> ok
[23:04:35] <Mariaa> i am using the jquery datepicker, i want to use php date(); instead of jquery date, where can i use the php date() in this code so that i have php date() ? http://pastie.org/5060557
[23:04:50] <dblosevn> from the form element you pass in this (a reference to the form) inside the function the reference is called form
[23:05:48] <dblosevn> Mariaa: you can populate datepicker with date('Y-m-d h:i:s', $yourtimestamp);
[23:06:00] <brend__> ok
[23:06:11] <dblosevn> Mariaa: in php
[23:07:50] <dblosevn> brend__: you can most likely remove the local var theform and change replace theform with form on your reset, I tried localizing theform to see if it was a scope issue
[23:08:03] <Mariaa> dblosevn: would that be line 13, 38 or 53? in the code? i think i have to do something like new Date('<?php echo $timestamp; ?>'); not sure though
[23:08:37] <brend__> dblosevn:  works perfectly.. i dont know how to say thanks man
[23:08:57] <dblosevn> brend__: buy me a beer i got paypal lmao
[23:09:09] <dblosevn> jk
[23:09:32] <coldhead> jk you don't really have paypal?
[23:10:00] <brend__> dblosevn:  i will buy a beer and ill send u my girlfriend
[23:10:30] <dblosevn> long as shes hot
[23:10:37] <dblosevn> Mariaa:                             endDate:<?php echo date('m/d/Y'); ?>
[23:10:38] <brend__> haha
[23:10:42] <dblosevn> oops
[23:10:50] <brend__> Argentina has pretty good chicks
[23:11:00] <dblosevn> Mariaa:                             endDate: '<?php echo date('m/d/Y'); ?>'
[23:11:30] <dblosevn> brend__: yes they do
[23:12:02] <brend__> anyway this summer ill go to Panama and see what do they have there
[23:12:18] <Mariaa> dblosevn: i did that, but it didn't work
[23:12:28] <dblosevn> you didnt have '' around it
[23:12:30] <Mariaa> its there commented out, if u see the paste
[23:12:37] <nveid> anyone here use javascript templates?
[23:12:55] <dblosevn> Mariaa: try my second paste bet it works :-D
[23:12:58] <Mariaa> oh ok
[23:13:04] <coldhead> which flavour, nveid ?
[23:13:09] <nveid> http://blueimp.github.com/JavaScript-Templates/tmpl.js
[23:13:16] <nveid> trying to find out why I can't access tmpl()
[23:13:54] <nveid> thinking there has to be some special way I suppose to pull the function out of where its at?
[23:14:14] <nveid> I checked in my javascript debug console.. define.amd & define does indeed == 'function'
[23:14:24] <nveid> though.. no idea where teh tmpl function is going
[23:15:35] <nveid> i took a look at define.amd also in my javascript debug console.. all i see is 'jquery' in it
[23:15:58] <dblosevn> maybe jQuery is conflicting
[23:16:06] <dblosevn> do jQuery.noConflict()
[23:16:30] <dblosevn> and update all your $ references with Jquery
[23:16:36] <dblosevn> *jQuery
[23:16:47] <nveid> hmm.. thats more work than I was imagining
[23:16:47] <brass> Mariaa, there is a song written about you. back in the late 80's
[23:17:01] <nveid> but i don't think it can be conflicting because the jquery upload plugin uses this template engine
[23:17:04] <brend__> well gotta sleep... dblosevn  hope to see u again around here dude
[23:17:12] <dblosevn> kk
[23:17:15] <dblosevn> peace
[23:17:31] <Mariaa> brass: lol i know
[23:18:20] <coldhead> nveid: i've never seen this tmpl engine before. i'd try something better known/supported like the templating in underscore or mustache.js
[23:18:33] <dblosevn> nveid: that template engine also uses $
[23:18:38] <brass> She walks like she don't care. / Smooth as silk, cool as air. / Ooh, it makes you wanna cry. / She doesn't know your name and your heart beats like a subway train ...
[23:18:43] <brass> -- Blondie
[23:18:55] <nveid> dblosevn:  its seems its only using $ if AMD isn't active
[23:19:27] <brass> yea sounds like a JQuery.noConflict() issue
[23:19:46] <dblosevn> you should not see any references to jquery insde of the tmpl object
[23:19:53] <dblosevn> as its not a jquery plug
[23:19:58] <dblosevn> *plugin even
[23:20:18] <dblosevn> a jquery plugin just happens to use it
[23:20:30] <nveid> Where it checks typeof define === "function" && define.amd .. It uses define instead of $
[23:20:37] <nveid> And jquery has AMD active
[23:21:04] <dblosevn> hmm wonder how jquery is being referenced inside the object then
[23:21:08] <coldhead> works for me here http://jsfiddle.net/nARmL/
[23:21:24] <coldhead> after drudging through the sauce >:|
[23:21:46] <nveid> So.. must be another script inferring I guess..
[23:22:12] <dblosevn> gotta be
[23:22:23] <nveid> ahh… i'm going to blame this on Aloha again
[23:22:27] <nveid> Aloha is always interferrring with stuff
[23:22:39] <AdamPDotty> evil aloha
[23:22:50] <coldhead> this works too http://jsfiddle.net/nARmL/1/
[23:23:00] <coldhead> crazy old sebastian
[23:23:23] <nveid> CKEditor3 needs to mature more so I can replace Aloha with that. :)
[23:24:42] <nveid> Yep.. I move the script include above my Aloha Editor and it works again
[23:25:13] <dblosevn> Mariaa: that work?
[23:25:33] <coldhead> my condolences for your wasted time, nveid
[23:26:41] <nveid> Well.. For the fact you showed me a test of it workign with jquery.. Led me to the one thing that I've been rooting out alot of my issues to every few weeks… I should of thought about that.
[23:26:46] <Mariaa> yes it does but, may be the date format is different, because it doesn't sets fields as it is supposed to
[23:27:04] <dblosevn> try Y-m-d
[23:27:23] <dblosevn> i just used the format you used
[23:28:16] <dblosevn> Well, i acutally accomplished somethings today as well, got my phone server configured and totally free phone service on my sip phones in the house :-D quality is pretty good too
[23:28:50] <brass> dblosevn, that is cool. You make a soft phone for you pbx?
[23:29:01] <dblosevn> Im using the 3cx softphone
[23:29:08] <dblosevn> and google voice for trunks
[23:29:35] <xorl> dblosevn, yet?
[23:29:40] <dblosevn> ?
[23:29:44] <coldhead> neat!
[23:29:53] <dblosevn> using freepbx
[23:30:22] <dblosevn> it seems gv doesnt have a limit on channels either, ive had 10 concurrent calls on one gv trunk
[23:30:57] <nveid> freepbx is awesome :)
[23:31:00] <dblosevn> im going to experiment with adding more google voice trunks
[23:31:01] <Mariaa> dblosevn: it works but the datepicker still gives me js date, not php date() , that means i have to make changes in some other lines too
[23:31:10] <nveid> Have that running on one of my servers.. its cut my inhouse VOIP costs down bigtime
[23:31:22] <dblosevn> oh... you mean the format in the datepicker isnt what you want
[23:31:43] <brass> datepicker has an attribute to format its output
[23:31:49] <dblosevn> you should play with adding google voice trunks totally free
[23:31:55] <dblosevn> ya im looking that up now
[23:32:19] <brass> { dateFormat: 'dd-mm-yy' }
[23:32:47] <Mariaa> dblosevn: no the date format is fine now, but i am still getting the wrong date in the field. I need the date from php.
[23:34:35] <dblosevn> oooo
[23:34:48] <dblosevn> Mariaa: your using the worng propertys
[23:35:08] <dblosevn> Mariaa: use minDate and maxDate not startDate and endDate
[23:36:23] <dblosevn> Mariaa: and defaultDate to set the default
[23:37:07] <dblosevn>                             minDate: '01/01/1970',
[23:37:07] <dblosevn>                             maxDate: '<?php echo date('m/d/Y'); ?>',
[23:37:07] <dblosevn> 							defaultDate: '<?php echo date('m/d/Y'); ?>'
[23:37:24] <dblosevn> that should work
[23:38:34] <dblosevn> xorl: what up?
[23:41:04] <Mariaa> dblosevn: should i psate the full code? so you can see why its filling the date field wrong?
[23:41:12] <Mariaa> i mean the whole source of page
[23:41:32] <dblosevn> paste it in jsfiddle
[23:46:20] <Mariaa> dblosevn: http://jsfiddle.net/hraXm/
