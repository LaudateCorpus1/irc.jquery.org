[00:47:44] <Paradisee> hello guys.
[00:48:01] <Paradisee> i'm having trouble with validation jquery module.
[00:48:30] <Paradisee> if i add something like: minlength="3" in an input.
[00:48:41] <Paradisee> i keep seeing the HTML5 tips.
[01:11:45] <Paradisee> how do i remove this tooltip? http://jsfiddle.net/uKZGp/

[02:16:39] <lilltiger_> Hi, do anyone know of a way to redirect the parent in a iframe and POST values to the target, I only find ways that uses GET
[02:25:24] <Cork> lilltiger_: the target="" attribute
[02:25:38] <Cork> target="_top" should work for example
[02:26:17] <Cork> _parent if you have multi level nesting
[02:29:47] <lilltiger_> Cork: right so if I use the jquery $.redirect script I need to add a parameter to the function and in the script implement the target attribute on the form tag right?
[02:30:11] <Cork> lilltiger_: i don't know what the redirect plugin does
[02:30:49] <lilltiger_> It's just a simple script that generates a form, ill just give it a try :)
[02:31:49] <lilltiger_> It works just fine :)
[02:37:16] <lilltiger_> Cork: This made me sad :'( I fixed it and was going to submit the fix and feel proud.. and I notice that I use an old version and the new version already have it fixed.
[02:37:30] <Cork> lol
[02:39:47] <lilltiger_> thought they also added requirement to give attribution, and that is just bothersome for a script like this, so I guess ill just keep my version (A)
[02:43:58] <Paradisee> Cork: is there a way to change the default message instead?
[02:44:36] <Cork> Paradisee: haven't looked into the error tooltips so not sure
[02:45:13] <Paradisee> btw i still have the same pop up..
[02:45:17] <Paradisee> it doesnt change.
[02:45:19] <Cork> i know you can style the field based on css spudo classes
[02:45:32] <Cork> Paradisee: i don't get it here (in chrome and firefox)
[02:46:09] <Paradisee> in chromium it doesnt change.
[02:46:20] <Cork> like i said, it does for me
[02:47:06] <Paradisee> which system are you on
[02:47:16] <Cork> the system doesn't matter
[02:48:09] <Paradisee> it still displays the tooltip.

[03:50:07] <cbliard> Hi, I am looking for qunit logo in HiRes or vectorial. I found this thread https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/222 but link to qunit.ai is 404. Do you know where I can find it?
[03:51:14] <cbliard> In fact, I found them on http://brand.jquery.org/logos/
[04:22:06] <Audlex> why wouldn't this work?
[04:22:08] <Audlex> if (!thisElement.hasClass('second') && viewport >= $('.scrollLast').offset().top) {
[04:22:25] <Audlex> it triggers even if it does have class 'second'
[04:25:59] <Cork> Audlex: you would have to show more context
[04:26:19] <Cork> might be thisElement isn't a dom element so hasClass returns undefined
[04:32:59] <Audlex> I have only just changed that from $('.scrollLast .sectionBackground')
[04:33:08] <Audlex> it is inside a scroll functiobn
[04:40:00] <Pazician> Hello everyone. I'm trying out isotope.js and when I set it all up, it's working kind of but the last element in the next row gets an top: 797px; why and how can I solve this? This is my code: http://pastebin.com/sN9wry62
[04:40:21] <Woet> Pazician: what does it have to do with jQuery?
[04:40:51] <Pazician> Woet: It is jQuery? It's a jQuery plugin, but still jQuery, right?
[04:41:59] <Pazician> On resize it's get perfect underneath the row, but why doesn't it get that position right away?
[04:42:35] <Woet> Pazician: www.jsfiddle.net
[04:42:39] <Woet> Pazician: repro it on there
[05:21:00] <benjick> Hey, I'm trying to simulate a click on the first object in a selection
[05:21:22] <benjick> http://pastebin.com/uj5GUVQJ
[05:21:32] <benjick> this is what I got, but nothing happens and it yields no errors
[05:22:57] <Cork> benjick: what is the element?
[05:23:09] <Cork> and what are you trying to do by faking a click on it?
[05:23:42] <benjick> It's an <a> element
[05:23:49] <Cork> and?
[05:23:59] <benjick> Just a simple workaround while we wait for the remake of the page
[05:24:13] <Cork> and what are you trying to do by faking a click on it? <--
[05:24:29] <Cork> that was why not what
[05:24:42] <FilipNortic> those $(button) select both button tags and inputs with type button ?
[05:24:47] <FilipNortic> does*
[05:25:13] <benjick> So this is using quicksand, and they have no default filter and I don't want to rewrite everything when we are close to a full redesign/recode
[05:25:15] <Cork> FilipNortic: that line just wrapps a variable called button in a jquery wrapper
[05:25:35] <Cork> benjick: could you please answer the question?
[05:26:08] <benjick> I'm trying to click a value to get a filter since quicksand doesn't support a default one
[05:26:14] <benjick> So each link is a filter
[05:26:25] <benjick> And I want the first one to be the default
[05:26:31] <benjick> Thus faking a click on it
[05:26:32] <Cork> benjick: and the filter is just a javascript handler?
[05:26:36] <Cork> or is it a link
[05:26:38] <Cork> or what
[05:26:55] <FilipNortic> Cork ok so same qustion for $('button') then
[05:26:57] <Cork> you not giving enough info to answer
[05:27:19] <benjick> What does it matter,it's an <a> element and I want to fake a click on it
[05:27:22] <Cork> FilipNortic: that selects all elements with the name "button" so no it doesn't select input elements
[05:27:42] <benjick> I know I can do it nicer but we're release a brand new site in a few weeks and I don't want to invest anything into it
[05:27:45] <Cork> benjick: cause browsers don't allow you to fake default actions on links
[05:27:54] <benjick> Oh okay
[05:27:59] <FilipNortic> so if I want to seelct both it will be a long selctor then
[05:27:59] <benjick> I see
[05:28:12] <FilipNortic> select*
[05:28:15] <benjick> That's too bad
[05:28:20] <Cork> FilipNortic: not really $(':submit')
[05:28:31] <benjick> Cork: thanks
[05:28:51] <Cork> oh sorry
[05:28:56] <FilipNortic> does that work event if the buttons isn't in a form?
[05:29:01] <Cork> FilipNortic: it is a :button selector
[05:29:13] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/button-selector/ <-- jquery fake selector
[05:29:28] <Cork> it results in a $( "button, input[type='button']" ) selector
[05:31:04] <FilipNortic> thx that what i was looking for
[05:33:31] <pokergod> if i do;  $('.test').bootpag(..);   and then I do it again, does it append 2 copies of bootpag on there?  How do you prevent added bootpag if is already there?
[05:33:55] <Cork> pokergod: that would depend on the plugin
[05:34:28] <Cork> but if it doesn't detect it by it self you wold have to keep track of what elements you have added it to and exclude those
[05:34:40] <Cork> (ex check if it gets a class)
[05:40:13] <pokergod> would  ... var par = $('.pgi').parent();   par.html('');  par.html('<div class="pagination"></div>');     Would that get rid of the bootpag if it were on $('.pagination').bootpag?
[05:44:20] <Cork> pokergod: the second command isn't needed
[05:44:21] <Cork> but yes
[05:44:34] <Cork> $('.pgi').parent().html('<div class="pagination"></div>');
[05:44:38] <Cork> would be all you need
[06:13:40] <benjick> How can I find the first data-value="X" in any element?
[06:14:12] <Cork> yg you mean the first child with a data-value attribute?
[06:14:46] <Cork> cause you can't find attributes
[06:14:50] <Cork> you can only search for elements
[06:14:56] <Cork> (based on attributes)
[06:15:03] <benjick> Cork: Yes, doing it with querySelector atm but I guess I want to do it in jquery, since it's all jquery?
[06:15:27] <Cork> it is the same selector
[06:15:32] <Cork> just $('')
[06:15:42] <benjick> Oh, I see
[06:15:45] <Cork> and for the first you use .first()
[06:15:52] <benjick> Thanks
[06:15:53] <Cork> (as it will find all)
[06:16:47] <benjick> and then I can do like .first.data('value');?
[06:16:51] <benjick> .first()*
[06:16:54] <Cork> ya
[06:17:10] <benjick> cool
[06:17:20] <benjick> var first = jQuery('[data-value]').first().data('value');
[06:17:24] <benjick> This works great
[06:17:37] <Cork> though note that attribute selectors are slow
[06:17:47] <Cork> so don't use that in performance critical code paths
[06:18:02] <benjick> Okay, so should I do it with ID or something?
[06:18:05] <benjick> Or would classes work?
[06:18:09] <Cork> a class ya
[06:18:15] <Cork> it is much much faster
[06:18:15] <benjick> sweet, thanks
[06:18:49] <Cork> (though depending on what you do it might not matter)
[06:44:08] <DarioLap> Hi all, in a text, i want to count underscores at beginning of the string. Example: "__pippo" has count 2, "_pi____ppo" has count 1. Finally i want to replace theese underscores (only firsts)
[06:56:58] <robhol> and what have you tried?
[10:28:02] <johndoe2> hello guys. I have a .js with a simple jQuery.click event that's not triggering, yet console.info() on the outside of the function properly posts to the console. Any ideas where I should start to troubleshoot it? It's worth noting that even vanilla javascript fails within that script (for example var whatever=getElementById('id') will say that whatever is null)
[10:55:39] <taplar> john-dev: try console logging the length of your selector that your binding the click event to, to see if it is matching anything
[12:13:46] <royalty> hmmm
[12:13:59] <royalty> i'm having trouble getting an owl carousel to work
[12:14:01] <royalty> version 2
[12:14:13] <duch_kazatel> bummer
[12:14:39] <royalty> ye
[12:15:03] <royalty> I'll look through the git issues on that project i guess
[12:15:09] <duch_kazatel> lol
[12:15:14] <duch_kazatel> what are the troubles you're having?
[12:15:29] <royalty> it just won't load, hold on i have a url
[12:16:34] <duch_kazatel> try making an isolated test case instead.
[12:16:49] <royalty> hmmm
[12:16:49] <royalty> sure
[12:23:35] <royalty> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/qzw9fy3u/2/
[12:23:36] <royalty> there
[12:23:41] <royalty> an isolated test case
[12:24:29] <royalty> oh oops
[12:24:30] <royalty> hold on
[12:24:32] <royalty> forgot something
[12:24:51] <royalty> ugh now it works
[12:24:54] <royalty> .........
[12:25:02] <duch_kazatel> uh
[12:25:13] <duch_kazatel> so that's not how you use 3rd party stuff in jsfiddle.
[12:25:27] <royalty> i got it working
[12:25:28] <royalty> http://jsfiddle.net/qzw9fy3u/4/
[12:25:32] <royalty> in the test case
[12:25:44] <royalty> i guess i'll just have to take stuff out on the website
[12:25:47] <royalty> and put stuff in
[12:25:48] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[12:25:50] <royalty> and see what sticks
[12:25:56] <duch_kazatel> wat
[12:26:05] <duch_kazatel> fwiw that's not the normal way to use jsfiddle.
[12:26:07] <royalty> you see that the slider works now?
[12:26:24] <royalty> yeah, i didn't know where the external resources were
[12:26:28] <royalty> for the new owlslider
[12:26:35] <duch_kazatel> is it on github?
[12:26:36] <royalty> so i just plopped them in
[12:26:37] <royalty> yeah
[12:26:45] <duch_kazatel> you can use rawgit for that then.
[12:26:50] <royalty> oh...
[12:27:00] <royalty> let me link you the github and then you can show me what you mean?
[12:27:13] <royalty> https://github.com/smashingboxes/OwlCarousel2
[12:27:18] <duch_kazatel> https://rawgit.com/
[12:28:12] <royalty> anyway i don't even see the minified js file
[12:28:15] <royalty> on github
[12:28:18] <duch_kazatel> you don't need it.
[12:28:32] <royalty> well it's a compilation of all the other files
[12:28:42] <royalty> so i guess i would have to add them all in in order
[12:28:46] <royalty> sounds like a pain tbh
[12:28:46] <duch_kazatel> lol whatevs mang.  just trying to help you out.
[12:29:02] <royalty> duch_kazatel, thanks, i'll know to use that in the future
[12:33:24] <royalty> duch_kazatel, honestly this is kind of fun http://jsfiddle.net/qzw9fy3u/8/
[12:42:12] <royalty> duch_kazatel, my mistake was text/javscript in the script tag
[12:42:17] <royalty> duch_kazatel, honestly i blame you
[12:42:26] <duch_kazatel> far out
[12:44:01] <royalty> i guess i should be putting scripts in head though
[12:44:05] <royalty> in a centralized area
[12:44:07] <duch_kazatel> or before </body>
[12:44:09] <duch_kazatel> depending
[12:44:10] <royalty> but let's ignore that for now
[12:47:58] <decx> wow
[12:48:30] <decx> fyi owl carousel is on cloudflare
[12:48:40] <codecutter> why is there a duplicate append for the very last append? http://pastebin.com/7Wn4zban
[12:49:02] <royalty> decx, don't be a hater
[12:49:19] <decx> wow
[12:49:27] <duch_kazatel> wat
[12:49:32] <decx> fyi a tip is a tip
[12:49:36] <royalty> drinking that haterade
[12:49:39] <royalty> like gatorade
[12:51:53] <codecutter> oh
[12:51:54] <codecutter> nvm
[12:53:20] <jop008> when I use <div class='ui-field-contain'>              <label for='4610_distance' >Afstand:</label>              <div id='4610_distance' /> </div> my rendering is woring with the next fields jquery mobile 145
[12:53:30] <duch_kazatel> wat
[12:53:49] <jop008> so how to use a non input fiield in combination with a field-contain
[12:54:06] <jop008> hoe gebruik je field-contain
[12:54:15] <jop008> als je geen input veld hebt
[12:54:24] <royalty> heben veblt skelter shelter
[12:54:29] <jop008> jqm 145
[12:54:40] <royalty> ovoibonkee shlemming
[12:55:14] <duch_kazatel> jop008 make a fiddle or something.
[12:55:43] <jop008> <div class='ui-field-contain'>              <label for='4610_distance' >Afstand:</label>              <div id='4610_distance' /> </div>
[12:55:50] <duch_kazatel> that isn't a fiddle.
[12:55:54] <jop008> is there a 145 fiddle I can use?
[12:56:09] <duch_kazatel> you can manually include whatever you want.
[12:56:24] <jop008> that is troublesome I tried it
[12:56:51] <duch_kazatel> not really, just need to do things in the right order.
[12:57:56] <royalty> jop008, your problem is porbably your script tags, make sure you put text/javascript
[12:58:05] <royalty> instead of text/javascrpt
[12:58:09] <duch_kazatel> royalty uh
[12:58:13] <duch_kazatel> that's probably not their problem.
[12:58:21] <royalty> you never know
[12:58:24] <royalty> might as well try
[12:59:07] <jop008> no no such typos
[12:59:14] <royalty> ok good just wanted to be sure
[13:54:42] <taplar> another day of code farming, riding my refactor, tilling up the logic
[13:57:13] <royalty> taplar, do you find that your code grows a lot when you farm it?
[13:57:32] <royalty> do you tend to use a lot of water?
[13:58:05] <taplar> depends on which plot i'm managing and what i'm growing.  sometimes i have to til a spagetti patch
[14:00:15] <royalty> yeah that makes sense
[15:06:22] <nebby> Hello, I'm trying to write a flickr feed search - but my results seem to be much worse than searching on the main site?
[15:08:05] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[15:09:23] <nebby> I'm following an example from here: http://blog.comperiosearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/super-simple-image-search.html
[15:09:31] <nebby> compare the search results of say "san fransisco" to the results on the main site
[15:09:35] <nebby> I am trying to figure out why it's such a difference
[15:10:30] <duch_kazatel> that's the way their API works.
[15:11:00] <duch_kazatel> there could be all sorts of reasons why :)
[15:12:24] <nebby> I want to get results like searching on their front page
[15:12:46] <duch_kazatel> my guess is you won't be able to get that.
[15:14:11] <nebby> why is that?
[15:14:17] <nebby> I'm trying to get photos of cities for a weather app
[15:14:31] <duch_kazatel> errr, then you certainly don't need their homepage search.
[15:14:54] <duch_kazatel> https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html also - i'm guessing they probably have some pretty tight settings for their homepage search to find all the really good content.
[15:14:56] <nebby> well in any case, the search results I'm getting from what I'm doing are very bad for cities
[15:15:28] <nebby> I'm using this
[15:15:28] <nebby> https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?jsoncallback=?
[15:15:34] <duch_kazatel> i saw ;)
[15:15:34] <nebby> with the tag of "san fransisco"
[15:15:43] <duch_kazatel> tune your settings https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html
[15:17:19] <nebby> to what.. :/
[15:17:28] <duch_kazatel> read the docs.
[15:17:32] <duch_kazatel> look to see what might work best.
[15:40:55] <mike[0]> django csrf verification is working in firefox but failing in chrome. what is going wrong? https://dpaste.de/p2BJ
[15:41:26] <mike[0]> working in chrome but failing in firefox*
[15:41:51] <duch_kazatel> i'd ask in a django channel.
[15:42:03] <duch_kazatel> see if they don't know.
[15:43:34] <mike[0]> duch_kazatel, i already did, they told me to come here
[15:43:56] <duch_kazatel> of course -_-
[15:43:59] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle.
[15:44:08] <duch_kazatel> obviously they don't see an issue with the server-side.
[15:44:16] <duch_kazatel> let's sete what's up with the client side.
[15:48:17] <glennreyes> hello
[15:56:20] <duch_kazatel> weee
[18:08:58] <LindsayMac> If i have to store multiple values in a data-attribute, what is the best way to store them? Just as a comma separated list?
[18:09:23] <duch_kazatel> store an ID and use an object that you reference instead.
[18:10:09] <LindsayMac> the markup is created by PHP
[18:10:17] <duch_kazatel> then update the php.
[18:10:42] <ngharo> why not just write out json to the data attr?
[18:10:53] <duch_kazatel> because it's ugly.
[18:10:54] <LindsayMac> Maybe im confused... how do I store an javascript object with the values in php?
[18:11:05] <duch_kazatel> you write out a javascript object.
[18:11:09] <LindsayMac> ngharo:  i was trying to not have to html encode everything
[18:11:24] <ngharo> json_encode takes care of all that
[18:11:27] <shoky> json in data-attributes is a nono ?
[18:11:40] <duch_kazatel> i've never really liked that personally shoky
[18:12:08] <shoky> can't say i am fond of the idea myself, but i haven't seen it frowned upon till now, that i can recall
[18:12:15] <LindsayMac> So if I have some variable that as a formatted JSON object... how do I basically associate that to a DOM object?
[18:12:27] <LindsayMac> err DOM element
[18:12:50] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac the object is key/value pairs - the data attribute then holds the key for the relevant value.
[18:13:23] <LindsayMac> Do you have an example somewhere I can look at?
[18:14:44] <ngharo> very yucky poc: <div data-obj="<?php echo json_encode(array('foo'=>'bar')); ?>"> ... $(div).data('obj').foo -> 'bar'
[18:15:59] <duch_kazatel> sure....
[18:16:00] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[18:19:05] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3xdoskj8/2/
[18:21:30] <LindsayMac> ok but my question is what needs to be done in my PHP to create that? The list of items in the obejcts is created via PHP ...
[18:21:50] <duch_kazatel> i don't know PHP, but it sounds like you need something to generate some JSON.
[18:22:09] <LindsayMac> I mean, I can do something like data-terms="'terms': ['term1', 'term2']"
[18:22:24] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  really i just need to know what the markup should look like for a data-attribute with multiple values
[18:22:25] <duch_kazatel> err.
[18:22:27] <duch_kazatel> ew.
[18:22:33] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't do that.
[18:22:38] <duch_kazatel> but just use commas i guess.
[18:22:44] <LindsayMac> ok.
[18:22:49] <duch_kazatel> i've been down that road before fwiw.
[18:22:54] <duch_kazatel> i speak from experience - it never ends well.
[18:23:11] <ngharo> csv < json.  Use JSON! both languages know how to parse it already
[18:23:24] <LindsayMac> then how would I deal with a DOM element that needs to be categorized in a way where it has multiple values
[18:23:35] <duch_kazatel> they have an array - comma separated is the same case, ngharo
[18:23:46] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac did you not look at the fiddle?
[18:23:47] <duch_kazatel> like...
[18:24:01] <duch_kazatel> you store data in the object and put a key on the dom element.
[18:24:08] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  i did.. that would require me making that object inside JS and not via PHP
[18:24:12] <duch_kazatel> the object can now hold anything and everything your heart desires.
[18:25:02] <LindsayMac> I need PHP to get the list of terms and create them. That means I have to pass those values from PHP or the DOM to jquery
[18:25:18] <LindsayMac> Which is kind of my initial question and why I was looking mainly at data-attributes
[18:25:42] <LindsayMac> that list of terms also has to be associated to a DOM element
[18:25:53] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[18:25:54] <ngharo> LindsayMac: did you not see my yucky POC above?
[18:26:05] <duch_kazatel> they have to get into the DOM/js objects for jquery to access them anyway.
[18:26:17] <duch_kazatel> js and php never directly communicate.
[18:26:17] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  huh?
[18:26:30] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  i know...
[18:26:58] <LindsayMac> You haven't exactly told me how to take my list which currently exists in PHP to jquery
[18:27:20] <duch_kazatel> by writing it out using JSON.
[18:27:22] <LindsayMac> I can make an array or anything else and echo it and print it any way I want... I dont know how to attach this javascript object to the element
[18:27:24] <duch_kazatel> i don't know php.
[18:27:29] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  did you not just say not to do that?
[18:27:35] <duch_kazatel> omfg
[18:27:39] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  wasn't that the first thing you said was not to use JSON
[18:27:51] <duch_kazatel> in the data attribute.
[18:27:56] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  if it's not in the data-attribute then where is it?
[18:28:09] <LindsayMac> Thats what i'm asking! WHERE? How ?
[18:28:09] <duch_kazatel> it's in the page somewhere.
[18:28:13] <duch_kazatel> in a script tag.
[18:28:15] <LindsayMac> smh what?!
[18:28:53] <duch_kazatel> that way you don't need to have some big ugly json attached to your dom node.
[18:28:59] <duch_kazatel> like i said, i've been down this road before.
[18:29:01] <LindsayMac> just inject a random script tag with my arrays is better than json in a DOM element?
[18:29:25] <shoky> you can have a <script type="application/json">
[18:29:32] <shoky> seems cleanest
[18:29:43] <LindsayMac> and if i do.. how do i associate each list with their proper dom element?
[18:29:54] <shoky> you output a json that looks like
[18:30:04] <LindsayMac> like this list of tags is for this <div id="list1">
[18:30:09] <duch_kazatel> aaaand again
[18:30:13] <ngharo> duch's example already showed you how to do that
[18:30:13] <shoky> {id1: actual_object_for_id1,  id2: actual_object_for_id2, ...}
[18:30:23] <ngharo> what happened to bot-t and ?tias
[18:30:28] <ngharo> that's what this channel needs
[18:30:35] <shoky> oh didnt see duch posted a fiddle
[18:30:40] <duch_kazatel> output some JSON onto the page, now there's a data id on the node that does that association.
[18:31:01] <duch_kazatel> now you're not lugging around a ton of extra data on every node.  touch cleaner.
[18:31:09] <duch_kazatel> anyway, i have a service to go to.  enjoy, folks!
[18:31:37] <shoky> LindsayMac is it clearer?
[18:32:13] <LindsayMac> yea
[18:32:28] <shoky> cool
[19:39:04] <Kamuela> I've only ever used jQuery, but what is jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile? Is there something that explains the libraries?
[19:42:14] <rcyr> I'll never understand.
[19:52:40] <Horacsio> I’m trying to create 3 buttons that lose their click state when are clicked, and get that state when other buttons are clicked: http://jsfiddle.net/n2bz9mxj/1/
[19:53:04] <Horacsio> but I can do that the first click, and not working on the following… why?
[19:55:29] <Horacsio> someone?
[19:58:07] <Horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/n2bz9mxj/3/ why it lose the state?
[20:05:30] <Horacsio> anyone?
[20:08:14] <Horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/n2bz9mxj/5/ ?
[20:09:46] <kevireilly> Horacsio: probably because you're replacing the elements and the click handler either needs to be rebound, or done differently
[20:10:03] <kevireilly> though it seems like you should just be using the `addClass` method
[20:10:05] <Horacsio> how’s that done?
[20:10:46] <Horacsio> but I need to replace the <a> to disable that link
[20:11:26] <kevireilly> http://jsfiddle.net/n2bz9mxj/6/
[20:11:52] <kevireilly> oh, i missed that detail, sorry
[20:13:05] <kevireilly> Horacsio: http://jsfiddle.net/n2bz9mxj/7/
[20:13:11] <Horacsio> hey Kevirelly don’t be sorry :) you’re helping here :)
[20:13:20] <kevireilly> crap
[20:13:42] <kevireilly> third times a charm http://jsfiddle.net/n2bz9mxj/8/
[20:15:45] <kevireilly> if any of that doesn't make sense, please lemme know
[20:22:04] <Horacsio> well the thing is that I need to display other divs… :S
[20:23:55] <kevireilly> can you explain more about your goal?
[20:25:03] <Horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/n2bz9mxj/9/
[20:25:32] <Horacsio> I’m trying this for hours so please believe that I’m pushing it really hard :)
[20:26:44] <Horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/n2bz9mxj/10/
[20:27:02] <Horacsio> but why your code keeps the cursor as hand?
[20:27:20] <kevireilly> ok, so it is important to note what I did on the click handler by separating the selectors with commas -- it binds the event handler to all those elements
[20:28:29] <kevireilly> ah right, certain ones fade in others fade out
[20:28:43] <Trinity> hi, i'm trying to use fancybox and i've followed the tutorial exactly but it doesn't seem to be working
[20:28:51] <Trinity> http://jsbin.com/mivunujozu/edit?html,js,output
[20:29:15] <theFlaxbeard> Hello!
[20:29:23] <Trinity> I think it may have something to do with the javascript since placing alert("stuff"); doesn't work unless I comment out the fancybox line
[20:29:27] <theFlaxbeard> Is there a way to only select elements not hidden by an overflow: hidden parent?
[20:30:30] <Horacsio> yes my friend Kevireilly! that’s the idea :)
[20:34:29] <kevireilly> Horacsio: http://jsfiddle.net/n2bz9mxj/11/
[20:35:34] <kevireilly> i forgot to add the active-rel class to .sh envio
[20:35:39] <Horacsio>  ;D
[20:36:10] <kevireilly> does that all make sense?
[20:36:11] <Trinity> any ideas guys?
[20:36:50] <Horacsio> I still have the sense that links are active when bordered bottom.
[20:40:16] <kevireilly> Horacsio: cursor: default; http://jsfiddle.net/n2bz9mxj/12/
[20:41:55] <kevireilly> theFlaxbeard: http://api.jquery.com/not/
[20:42:25] <Horacsio> oooh you added data-rel=".dc" to the first divs :D
[20:42:30] <kevireilly> Trinity: console says "Uncaught TypeError: $(...).fancybox(...) is not a function"
[20:42:30] <theFlaxbeard> kevireilly: Right, but what's the selector to select hidden objects through overflow:hidden?
[20:42:38] <theFlaxbeard> :visible doesn't seem to work
[20:43:01] <Horacsio> now I got it :D
[20:43:56] <kevireilly> theFlaxbeard: you can pass not a jquery object or element and can probably use something like .parents('[overflow!='hidden']) or something
[20:44:21] <theFlaxbeard> kevireilly: I want to know if the div is hidden because it's overflowing, not if the parent is overflow: hidden
[20:44:26] <kevireilly> or maybe .parents(':visible'), not sure.. easier with a test case to try things
[20:44:26] <theFlaxbeard> sorry, didn't specify
[20:44:58] <kevireilly> produce a test case demonstrating the goal
[20:45:04] <Trinity> kevireilly, thanks. was an issue with jQuery :)
[20:45:15] <kevireilly> no problem
[20:45:32] <Trinity> kevireilly, would you mind explaining how you got console to output? was this in jsbin?
[20:45:46] <theFlaxbeard> kevireilly: Sure, lemmie get one working quick
[20:47:21] <kevireilly> Trinity: I'm using chrome and pressed Command + Alt + i (osx) or View > Developer > Javascript console
[20:47:32] <theFlaxbeard> kevireilly: http://jsfiddle.net/y0exk5x2/
[20:47:41] <Trinity> ah, doh, on the output file :)
[20:47:42] <Trinity> thanks
[20:47:49] <theFlaxbeard> How do I select the unhidden boxes only (specifically, trying to count 'em)
[20:52:13] <kevireilly> theFlaxbeard: without JS? perhaps update with what you've tried or something for me to go off of
[20:53:19] <theFlaxbeard> kevireilly: http://jsfiddle.net/y0exk5x2/1/
[20:53:48] <theFlaxbeard> I'm thinking I might be able to use the y-position?
[20:53:53] <kevireilly> ah right, visibility is more for `visible` and `display` properties i think
[20:55:53] <kevireilly> err the pseudo selector :visible instead of visibility in my statement
[20:57:42] <theFlaxbeard> kevireilly: Found a solution!
[20:57:50] <theFlaxbeard> I just use .filter and check the position.top
[20:58:01] <theFlaxbeard> because hidden elements wrap but are invisble
[20:58:26] <kevireilly> sweet!
[20:58:35] <kevireilly> good move
[21:13:18] <Horacsio> kevireilly: thank you for the help. I’m still figure it out on how to apply to my code… that data-rel is not well accepted or I’ve put it on the wrong place :D
[21:33:38] <kevireilly> Horacsio: hrm i'd probably need to see some code to help unless you can explain what isn't working like you'd expect
[21:36:00] <NitroLiq> I'm working on something where I need to pull a menu (unordered list) out of a Foundation top bar and create a standalone menu. While I can do this, I'm trying to get a feel for best practices.
[21:36:54] <Horacsio> kevireilly: its a woocommerce checkout page...
[21:36:55] <NitroLiq> I know it's icky to kind of create  all of the markup in jquery but it seems just as gross leaving an empty container in the markup to append to
[21:37:15] <NitroLiq> and worse to duplicate the content and hide/show
[21:37:43] <kevireilly> Horacsio: ok, never heard of it
[21:38:13] <Horacsio> :)
[21:42:45] <Horacsio> kevireilly: http://paste.ofcode.org/PcW8AkuARKmbeNFNaG52a7
[21:44:57] <Horacsio> kevireilly: I think I’ve found the error. it’s in the classes
[21:45:03] <Horacsio> data-rel
[21:46:52] <Horacsio> yes it was
[21:46:57] <kevireilly> groovy
[21:47:11] <Horacsio> now I need to do one small adjust to the first div…
[21:47:22] <Horacsio> two are working great… the first is not!
[21:48:23] <kevireilly> me not really sure what is being referred to
[21:50:57] <Horacsio> :D
[21:56:29] <Horacsio> kevinreilly: can I have two data-rel? like data-rel=".login, .xpto”?
[21:57:01] <Horacsio> MANAGED :D

[22:01:39] <pcfreak30> I just hit the source of a long running issue. What would cause jquery mobile to do a infinite ajax refresh loop with a jquery tab
[22:01:49] <pcfreak30>  <li><a href="#tab-description" data-ajax="false"><?php echo $tab_description; ?></a></li>
[23:28:38] <cuppy> How do I $('#mydiv').html() so that it includes the html of #mydiv ?
[23:31:05] <rcyr> jQuery doesn't support that.
[23:31:48] <rcyr> But you could use pure DOM by doing   var x = $('#mydiv')[0].outerHTML;
[23:32:07] <z1haze2> why wont this submit? http://dpaste.com/3V83K8B
[23:33:39] <z1haze2> oh ffs, nevermind. I forgot to run gulp
