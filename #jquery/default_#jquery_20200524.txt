[09:12:55] <hansbrix> hi, having an issue with on(), i think i have a misunderstanding. I want to bind code to run on dynamically created elements nested beneath a div each time its created (a modal window)
[09:13:47] <hansbrix> https://jsfiddle.net/hookloom/shaLwpe3/5/ is a simplified example that works. My issue is that when the div there is destroyed then created, the code doesn't fire. I think i have an error in my element for the delegation

[09:20:13] <candyban> Seems like a simple thing, but how can I loop over an object sorted by the keys ? $.each()  seems to have random order
