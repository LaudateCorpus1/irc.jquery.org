[05:17:07] <Duikb00t> Hello
[06:09:37] <Duikb00t> Is there a way of writing this shorter? http://paste.ee/p/9f0Jy
[06:47:48] <rindolf> Hi all. Sup?
[06:53:21] <circ-user-DqD7H> Hi
[06:53:21] <circ-user-DqD7H> http://pastebin.com/uKryAK3R
[06:54:27] <circ-user-DqD7H> i try to drop an element into a div (it's work) but when i want drop into this same div, it's not work why ?
[07:39:11] <xenaxon> hi. any file syncronisation script with live progress?
[08:29:13] <hellyeah> hey there
[08:29:42] <hellyeah> i want to change original position of button when they have certain color
[08:29:47] <hellyeah> is it possible to do that
[08:30:18] <hellyeah> in this example you will see red button when button become red i want to move it to the top http://jsfiddle.net/u1pdhk8c/125/
[08:36:22] <derstrom> hellyeah: Perhaps look at something along the lines of $('#elem').detach().prependTo('#elem2') - this will detach #elem from the DOM and place it at the top of all child elements within the #elem2 container
[08:36:36] <derstrom> (If this is what you are looking to do)
[08:37:57] <hellyeah> let me take a look
[08:38:20] <derstrom> https://api.jquery.com/detach/ and https://api.jquery.com/prependto/ is what you need to look at if this is what you are trying to achieve.
[08:38:21] <hellyeah> if i understand truly this will delete element from the dom and add it as first child of spesific element right
[08:38:57] <derstrom> It won't fully delete it but will detach it, so it still exists as a jQuery object and can be re-added to the DOM.
[08:39:30] <hellyeah> okey i will take a look
[08:39:48] <hellyeah> but if you check my example there is red, orange, gray, green and blue buttons
[08:40:16] <hellyeah> it is not juse one element i try to order
[08:40:35] <hellyeah> i try to order one element that has 5 different colors i will take a look now
[08:40:46] <hellyeah> samen principle is applied for all of it i guess
[08:40:55] <hellyeah> can i detach all buttons from the dom
[08:41:06] <hellyeah> and re added again with my own order
[08:41:07] <hellyeah> ?
[08:42:13] <derstrom> Well if you have a common class for each type of colour (e.g. .green, .blue, etc.), detach() and prependTo() should affect all elements that have the same class
[08:42:28] <derstrom> So if you want a specific colour above all others, this approach should work.
[08:43:11] <derstrom> But you'll have to try it out, I'm just throwing out theory here.
[08:46:20] <hellyeah> yeah i have green, b≈üue, red, gray, orange class
[08:46:43] <hellyeah> okey i will give it a shot
[10:26:26] <hellyeah> hey threre
[10:26:34] <hellyeah> i am sorry my question sounds non-sense
[10:27:43] <hellyeah> when you click checkbox it filters and show appropriate button on div but when you click and declick checkboxes i want to show all buttons again. I mean you click checkboxes let say all of them and you did unchecked all of them and show the all button is it possible to do that http://jsfiddle.net/u1pdhk8c/149/
[10:28:46] <taplar> try showing them all before you do the hiding
[10:29:10] <timwis> Hey guys, is there a way to use $.when() to wait for an array of promises to be completed before continuing, but ignore any failed promises? (and continue anyway)
[10:29:39] <taplar> timwis, a failure is considered finishing
[10:29:58] <timwis> taplar yes but if any one of them fails, it stops waiting for the others
[10:30:09] <timwis> and goes straight to .always() or .fail()
[10:30:10] <hellyeah> taplar: did you mean this but it doesnt work http://jsfiddle.net/u1pdhk8c/151/
[10:31:26] <taplar> hellyeah, actually you know, if you defaulted all the checkboxes to checked, it would make sense if none were selected that nothing would show
[10:32:10] <hellyeah> ,c
[10:32:44] <taplar> $($divs).hide();
[10:32:47] <taplar> why are you re-wrapping?
[10:35:08] <hellyeah> taplar: totally make sense
[10:35:10] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/u1pdhk8c/153/
[10:35:35] <hellyeah> btw this is in my mind http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3331353/transitions-on-the-display-property
[10:38:01] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/u1pdhk8c/154/
[10:38:52] <hellyeah> !$checked.length
[10:38:54] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:39:03] <taplar> 0 is falsy
[10:39:12] <hellyeah> honeslty  that usage is confused me
[10:39:18] <taplar> which part?
[10:39:26] <hellyeah> seems logical but still confused me
[10:39:39] <hellyeah> i dont know you can do this in c or c# or java
[10:39:50] <hellyeah> python has smt like that i dont know
[10:39:53] <taplar> your writing javascript
[10:40:04] <hellyeah> yeah js has different nature right
[10:40:10] <hellyeah> is it about coercion?
[10:40:19] <taplar> yeah
[10:40:24] <taplar> like i said, 0 is falsy
[10:40:32] <hellyeah> ah okey
[10:40:34] <hellyeah> now make sense
[10:40:42] <hellyeah> you know if you ask me this looks nicer
[10:40:55] <hellyeah> then make checkbox default checked
[10:41:19] <taplar> it takes the stance that you shouldn't ever not show anything
[10:41:55] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:42:03] <hellyeah> but this looks nicer
[10:42:34] <hellyeah> i mean
[10:42:53] <hellyeah> this is more useful when you think people observe the many screen
[10:43:55] <hellyeah> taplar: can i ask this? ordering button is a nice idea. What do you think? I mean like red, orange, gray, green, blue
[10:44:14] <hellyeah> show in order when button has same color and grouping button is the aim here
[10:45:47] <hellyeah> someone suggest me this  $('#elem').detach().prependTo('#elem2')
[10:46:17] <taplar> you don't have to detach if your only going to re append it.  jquery does it for you
[10:47:22] <hellyeah> so
[10:47:41] <hellyeah> $('#elem').append('#elem2') is enough?
[10:47:49] <taplar> yes
[10:48:57] <hellyeah> let me see
[10:51:06] <taplar> cleaned it up a bit: http://jsfiddle.net/u1pdhk8c/156/
[10:51:54] <hellyeah> filter seems handy
[10:52:05] <hellyeah> thank you btw
[10:52:28] <taplar> filter and map are your friend, :)
[10:52:42] <hellyeah> let me take a note
[10:53:21] <hellyeah> i know it is old example but this is what you meant line 24-25 http://jsfiddle.net/u1pdhk8c/157/
[10:54:11] <taplar> uh, what are you trying to append?
[10:54:23] <hellyeah> humm
[10:54:39] <hellyeah> actually i dont awnt to append something
[10:54:48] <hellyeah> i just want to move red button to the top
[10:55:00] <hellyeah> that why detach was there
[10:55:57] <timwis> so any thoughts on how to use $.when() but not reject entirely if one promise fails?
[10:55:59] <hellyeah> like detach button that is red and append it to dom
[10:56:33] <taplar> uh, first a question
[10:56:44] <hellyeah> ye?
[10:56:53] <taplar> why are you running the message checker when a button is clicked?
[10:56:58] <taplar> timwis, got a fiddle?
[10:57:21] <hellyeah> damn
[10:57:53] <hellyeah> thanks for warning
[10:58:46] <taplar> and instead of looping through the buttons and putting classes on them, why not put the classes on the elements in the html?
[10:59:31] <timwis> taplar: https://gist.github.com/timwis/5a0aad399573cea93bc2
[10:59:51] <timwis> I'd like always() to be called when all 3 promises finish, even if one of them fails
[11:00:17] <timwis> the problem is if one of them fails, it stops waiting for the other 2 and immediately calls always()
[11:00:26] <hellyeah> taplar: i try to do this but why button is on top i dont have any idea http://jsfiddle.net/u1pdhk8c/162/
[11:00:45] <hellyeah> taplar: well
[11:00:45] <taplar> timwis, huh, that's odd behavior to me.  does it do the same thing for done() ?
[11:01:02] <hellyeah> i dont have any control over htrml
[11:01:09] <timwis> .done() doesn't get called if there are failures, that would go to .fail()
[11:01:16] <taplar> true
[11:01:17] <hellyeah> about button creation
[11:02:51] <hellyeah> taplar: check this out http://jsfiddle.net/u1pdhk8c/165/
[11:04:21] <hellyeah> brb
[11:11:45] <timwis> taplar seems it's by design http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13493084/jquery-deferred-always-called-at-the-first-reject
[11:46:09] <taplar> hellyeah, cleaned it up jsfiddle.net/u1pdhk8c/167/
[12:07:06] <hellyeah> yo
[12:07:35] <taplar> i'm heavily refactoring your logic, >:)
[12:07:44] <hellyeah> pls look at line 22-49 i try to prder buttons like red, orange, gray, green, blue but i cannot order it properly can you give me some idea for doing that. http://jsfiddle.net/u1pdhk8c/183/
[12:07:54] <hellyeah> taplar: mine?
[12:08:16] <hellyeah> taplar: about button's class
[12:08:37] <hellyeah> let me tell this to you i have json from backend i am taking this json to js
[12:08:51] <hellyeah> so i am creating button dynamically in my real logic
[12:09:02] <hellyeah> it is just for study
[12:09:21] <hellyeah> i try to see what i can do since i am not advanced yet
[12:12:25] <hellyeah> any suggestion?
[12:12:34] <taplar> still refactoring
[12:13:17] <hellyeah> you rewrite the code?
[12:13:32] <taplar> a little, and i'm reorganizing it to split it up a bit
[12:13:42] <hellyeah> oh
[12:13:52] <hellyeah> i hope my logic does make sense
[12:16:38] <taplar> ok, let me know if any of this is confusing: http://jsfiddle.net/u1pdhk8c/186/
[12:20:24] <hellyeah> first of all it is really clean
[12:20:36] <hellyeah> secondly i am not that far to write this kind of code
[12:20:42] <hellyeah> fortunately
[12:20:47] <taplar> so lets talk about it
[12:20:49] <taplar> what's confusing
[12:21:26] <hellyeah> nothing actually
[12:21:30] <hellyeah> thats awesome code
[12:21:55] <hellyeah> i didnt know you can use , for another function
[12:22:08] <hellyeah> hmm is it general notation
[12:22:10] <taplar> they are in side an object
[12:22:20] <taplar> object elements are separated with commas
[12:22:23] <hellyeah> i juse see usage of , in ajax and in jqueryui
[12:22:29] <taplar> the elements just happen to be functions
[12:23:15] <hellyeah> ic
[12:23:23] <taplar> the other object is used for namespacing
[12:23:30] <taplar> other=outer
[12:24:47] <hellyeah> appNameSpace.animateWarningText
[12:25:02] <hellyeah> so appNameSpace is an object
[12:25:11] <taplar> AppNamespace, yes
[12:25:13] <hellyeah> animateWarningText is a function
[12:25:34] <taplar> it's a property of the object, who references a function
[12:25:56] <taplar> just like var something = function () {};
[12:26:03] <taplar> something is the reference to the function
[12:26:06] <hellyeah> ic
[12:26:34] <hellyeah> at least my logic makes sense
[12:26:41] <hellyeah> :)
[12:27:16] <hellyeah> i just dont understand
[12:27:25] <hellyeah> you use $buttons, $warningText
[12:27:31] <hellyeah> but i didnt see any selector
[12:27:39] <hellyeah> ops
[12:27:40] <taplar> look at the bottom in the document ready
[12:27:42] <hellyeah> sorry
[12:28:47] <hellyeah> everything is understandable actually
[12:28:59] <hellyeah> this code is really self-documented
[12:29:00] <hellyeah> :XD
[12:29:03] <taplar> that's what you want, :)
[12:29:16] <taplar> to express not only the logic, but the intended logic
[12:29:41] <hellyeah> with intended logic i guess you meant the order of function right
[12:29:49] <taplar> no, function names
[12:29:54] <hellyeah> humm
[12:30:09] <hellyeah> function name is important concept
[12:30:13] <hellyeah> i am not so good at it
[12:30:15] <taplar> the logic is broken up into small pieces and the function names tell you what should happen in the function
[12:30:43] <taplar> if the function does not do what the name says, then either the name is wrong or the logic is wrong
[12:31:13] <taplar> which usually you write the name first to know what your trying to do
[12:31:34] <hellyeah> yeah you are right
[12:32:20] <hellyeah> thank you
[12:32:33] <hellyeah> taplar: btw i gotta say
[12:32:38] <hellyeah> god bless you really
[12:32:48] <hellyeah> it is my 1 and half year at work
[12:33:12] <taplar> congrats
[12:33:40] <hellyeah> and i had a chance to innovate the front of company
[12:33:49] <hellyeah> this is really big bank and i had this chance
[12:33:57] <hellyeah> of course i am learning fast
[12:34:10] <hellyeah> but you really helpeed me out to handle this process
[12:34:30] <taplar> we're not done yet, :).  there is currenly at least one issue with the logic
[12:34:32] <hellyeah> probably this will work in i.e.
[12:34:52] <hellyeah> taplar: hmm i am taking about it everytime
[12:35:02] <hellyeah> i see one thing actually
[12:35:25] <hellyeah> when you large the div there is no space between buttons
[12:35:29] <hellyeah> thats not desirable
[12:35:34] <hellyeah> i dont know you meant that
[12:35:41] <taplar> that's a css issue, not a logic issue
[12:35:46] <taplar> do this
[12:35:50] <taplar> filter on one of the colors
[12:35:55] <taplar> and then click one of the buttons
[12:36:33] <hellyeah> wow this works perfect in i.e.
[12:37:12] <hellyeah> okey
[12:37:29] <hellyeah> ic
[12:37:38] <hellyeah> when you click the filtered button
[12:37:45] <hellyeah> it will show all buttons
[12:37:50] <hellyeah> is that it?
[12:38:11] <hellyeah> yeah that seems like problem
[12:38:12] <taplar> you filter by a color, only those colors show.  then you click a button, all the colors reappear
[12:38:25] <hellyeah> yeah
[12:38:37] <taplar> which makes sense.  your button logic was written before your filter logic
[12:38:58] <taplar> so now it just needs to be modified to not reshow elements that don't match the filter on a button click
[12:39:04] <hellyeah> i know why that is
[12:39:23] <hellyeah> line 67
[12:39:35] <taplar> no
[12:39:41] <taplar> it's related to the clicking of the button
[12:40:55] <hellyeah> line 45
[12:40:56] <hellyeah> ?
[12:41:01] <taplar> yup
[12:41:09] <taplar> blanket show of the hidden fields
[12:41:54] <hellyeah> yes
[12:43:03] <hellyeah> hmm
[12:43:12] <hellyeah> it created another problem
[12:43:15] <hellyeah> or i did smt wrong
[12:43:27] <taplar> what did you change?
[12:44:11] <hellyeah> i did this but it is wrong i guess  $(this).filter(':hidden').show();
[12:44:26] <taplar> the button you clicked wouldn't be hidden
[12:45:15] <taplar> so lets think about the issue
[12:45:27] <taplar> before the filter, a global show worked cause everything always showed
[12:45:34] <taplar> now, not the case
[12:45:50] <tuskkk___> I am trying to get the href, please help, https://jsfiddle.net/owhf52qq/1/
[12:45:52] <taplar> in both cases, the intended functionality is to show the previously hidden button hidden by a click
[12:46:39] <taplar> tuskkk___, media-heading doesn't have a previous sibling
[12:46:40] <hellyeah> yeah
[12:46:57] <hellyeah> not the show all button
[12:47:03] <taplar> tuskkk___, try parent().prev()
[12:47:29] <hellyeah> when you click checkboxes it show just related table
[12:47:36] <hellyeah> but other button is still visible
[12:47:44] <hellyeah> well
[12:47:50] <tuskkk___> awesome, thanks taplar!
[12:47:53] <hellyeah> one if may solve the issu
[12:47:53] <hellyeah> e
[12:48:02] <hellyeah> checking state of button
[12:50:09] <hellyeah> hmm
[12:58:03] <taplar> got a visitor, i'm going to be out for a while.  gl
[12:58:13] <hellyeah> okey thank you
[12:58:25] <hellyeah> tomorrow can i ask if i cannot do it
[13:54:18] <printForever> how to check if the plugin is loading
[13:54:19] <printForever> ?
[13:55:56] <johndoe2> printForever console.log("plugin <name> loaded"); inside the plugin's file
[13:56:14] <printForever> ok
[13:56:30] <printForever> I will check
[13:56:36] <johndoe2> or use $.isFunction() on a function provided by the plugin
[13:57:11] <printForever> thanks!
[13:57:16] <johndoe2> yup
[14:22:51] <printForever> I've tired  $.isFunction('swipebox');
[14:22:56] <printForever> but it always returns false
[14:23:00] <printForever> even when its there
[16:27:19] <bojanlazic> What is wrong with this approach was working for me before it say's Uncaught TypeError: $(...).waypoint is not a function, got jquery and jquery UI before the waypoints
[16:27:44] <bojanlazic> http://jsfiddle.net/Kibs/a4qL05yu/
[16:30:37] <oojacoboo> bojanlazic: I don't think waypoints is a jquery module
[16:34:32] <bojanlazic> oojacoboo: thanks
[16:36:06] <bojanlazic> handler: function() {
[16:36:07] <bojanlazic>     notify('Basic waypoint triggered')}
[16:36:56] <bojanlazic> can I do instead of this   $('.about-us').addClass('animated fadeInUp');
[16:37:21] <bojanlazic> Sorry i mean $().addClass instead notify
[16:37:55] <bfig> hello, I'm using bootstrap to make a plugin for an ERP. Currently I can't control 100% the place to put the html, and my modals are not working, they are all greyed out and I can't click on them. Is there a way to fix this without repositioning the element in the DOM?
[16:39:55] <oojacoboo> yes bfig learn to not use bootstrap
[16:39:59] <oojacoboo> then you'll have your answer
[16:48:39] <bojanlazic> oojacoboo: how would you change this: notify(this.id + ' hit') in something like    $('#about-us').addClass('animated fadeInUp');
[16:49:23] <oojacoboo> bojanlazic: I'm not following you
[16:49:25] <oojacoboo> that doesn't make sense
[16:51:24] <bojanlazic> well I wanna use operation to target #about-us and addClass, but they are using notify which as I read is a part of jquery library do I need to include that or? I included only <script src="/bower_components/waypoints/lib/noframework.waypoints.js"></script>
[16:52:21] <bojanlazic> Or how to use their library with jquery as I did before
[16:55:23] <oojacoboo> bojanlazic: I'm still not understanding you
[16:56:26] <bojanlazic> how do I call the #about-us and addClass with their noframework approach ?
[17:01:07] <oojacoboo> document.getElementById().className = "whatever";
[17:01:23] <oojacoboo> document.getElementById("id").className = "whatever";
[18:39:39] <Yzandre> Bonsoir je recherche une aide pour un petit code en jquery
[18:43:43] <Yzandre> Bonsoir je cherche de l'aide sur un bout de code s'il vous plait, merci
[18:45:32] <Yzandre> Hi , i need help for code plz thx
[18:46:43] <derstrom> Yzandre: What's your question? If you need to paste code, please put it on jsfiddle.net and provide a URL with your question.
[19:50:50] <bfig> hello, is there a reason why bootstrap modal could break after I use the 'draggable' interface? Specifically, the 'grey out' of the modal background is on top of the modal if I modal('show') *after* using the draggable
[19:52:04] <oojacoboo> bfig: b/c it's how things go with "tools" like bootstrap
[19:52:13] <oojacoboo> .testcase
[19:52:22] <oojacoboo> !testcase
[19:52:24] <oojacoboo> :/
[19:53:56] <bfig> oojacoboo: my test case can't be easily put in jsfiddle, but you can get access to my dev server if you want to see what I mean
[19:54:14] <oojacoboo> link?
[19:54:27] <bfig> http://ec2-52-27-6-23.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8069/web#action=467 admin:admin
[19:55:06] <bfig> once you see the waste management -> plan de charges, click 'lundi'. The modal is $('schedule-modal'), the offending draggables are the boxes on the right
[19:56:07] <bfig> you can $('schedule-modal').modal('show') and it works, you can do this as many times as you want. Once you drag one of the boxes on the right (jqueryUI draggable, and droppables are on the boxes on the left-center), if you 'show' the modal, it is greyed out
[19:57:15] <bfig> I think part of the problem has to do with the 'appendTo' in the draggable, but without that, the z-index will not play correctly with the boxes on the left-center
[19:58:22] <oojacoboo> bfig: how do you trigger the modal?
[19:58:52] <bfig> oojacoboo: in the application, I need to drag the boxes on the right that have a frequency different from unique to the tours on the left
[19:59:03] <bfig> only one is there ,for test purposes, ctrl f 'daily'
[19:59:40] <bfig> you drop them into the blue trucks, once you start dragging you will see. Also there is some issue with droppable hitbox, but I'm solving this one step at a time
[19:59:59] <oojacoboo> god this interface is horrible
[20:00:11] <oojacoboo> look how much you've done to explain how to click a think
[20:00:13] <oojacoboo> thing*
[20:00:14] <bfig> it's on development...
[20:00:23] <oojacoboo> even for development :(
[20:00:25] <bfig> this is a pretty complex interface, it comes with a manual
[20:00:36] <oojacoboo> yea, I bet - which is sad
[20:00:52] <bfig> it's not supposed to be a simple interface, it is supposed to show all business critical info
[20:01:09] <oojacoboo> I drag and drop but nothing happens
[20:01:16] <bfig> it will get better, once I set up the basic functionality
[20:01:21] <bfig> did you click lundi?
[20:01:34] <bfig> it should show the places where you can drop
[20:01:58] <oojacoboo> .ui-draggable { cursor: move }
[20:02:04] <oojacoboo> fix that please
[20:02:13] <oojacoboo> .ui-draggable:hover { cursor: move }
[20:02:20] <bfig> ready
[20:02:22] <oojacoboo> sorry ^^
[20:02:31] <bfig> it's ok, i'm open to feedback :D
[20:02:38] <oojacoboo> I dropped
[20:02:42] <oojacoboo> it doesn't do anything
[20:02:52] <bfig> it does... it is just that you didn't drop on the right place
[20:02:54] <oojacoboo> and yes, on one of the trucks
[20:02:57] <bfig> :D
[20:03:02] <oojacoboo> okay, then where?
[20:03:07] <bfig> drop on the left bottom corner where i just told you
[20:03:23] <bfig> the context dragged will change, you will know
[20:03:57] <oojacoboo> http://files.jacobt.com/otQoMEeVNd
[20:03:59] <bfig> let me re enable the appendTo body, because it is hard to see like this
[20:04:56] <bfig> don't drop on the blue button, drop on the left-bottom corner of the container
[20:05:27] <bfig> (that contains the blue buttons)
[20:06:05] <bfig> I am not 100% sure why this happens but it has to do with the jquery droppable not being properly setup with knockoutjs
[20:06:22] <oojacoboo> http://files.jacobt.com/otQoMEeVNd
[20:06:24] <oojacoboo> http://files.jacobt.com/i8fDmQ0ckg
[20:07:04] <oojacoboo> garbage
[20:07:33] <oojacoboo> first things first, make the UI easier to bug test
[20:07:40] <oojacoboo> you're making it harder on yourself
[20:07:56] <bfig> the place you need to drop is on the bottom left corner of the container below the 0/25 containers
[20:08:34] <oojacoboo> bfig: see that last video?
[20:08:36] <bfig> container with class od-toursubt, bottom-left corner
[20:08:40] <oojacoboo> I tried dropping it everywhere
[20:08:45] <oojacoboo> fix the UI and I'll try again
[20:08:59] <bfig> no, it's a very small place, it *should* be the blue buttons, but their hitbox is not properly computed by jquery
[20:09:12] <oojacoboo> bfig: watch the last video
[20:09:16] <bfig> i watched!
[20:09:19] <bfig> let me illustrate
[20:09:44] <oojacoboo> I found it!
[20:09:56] <oojacoboo> wtf man
[20:09:58] <oojacoboo> ...
[20:10:27] <bfig> it is broken!
[20:10:40] <bfig> one fix at a time :p
[20:10:54] <bfig> in theory, the droppables are the blue buttons, but they don't quite work
[20:12:09] <oojacoboo> div.modal-backdrop { z-index: 100; }
[20:13:24] <bfig> nope :(
[20:13:56] <oojacoboo> nope?
[20:14:02] <oojacoboo> yes, that exposes your modal
[20:14:22] <oojacoboo> you just need to fix those other box's z-index to be back to a normal range
[20:14:46] <bfig> i changed it and refreshed, the modal sits at 64 z-index
[20:14:58] <oojacoboo> ok
[20:15:07] <oojacoboo> then set the overlay below that
[20:15:22] <bfig> yeah it doesn't work quite well as you said before
[20:15:22] <oojacoboo> not sure how that changes
[20:15:46] <bfig> the other boxes are still above it, let me see what I can do
[20:15:54] <oojacoboo> I like to make things work as I go
[20:16:01] <oojacoboo> not overlay broken on top of broken on top of broken
[20:16:08] <oojacoboo> b/c then you can't tell what's breaking what
[20:16:39] <bfig> it wasn't broken up to this point
[20:16:59] <oojacoboo> not sure I can agree, I see about 10 things that are broken
[20:17:01] <bfig> things that were broken were being fixed ish
[20:17:07] <oojacoboo> whereas you shouldn't be dealing with maybe 2-3 tops
[20:17:17] <bfig> can you point to them?
[20:17:38] <bfig> to one or two at least, this is really not my elemetn
[20:17:42] <oojacoboo> when I drag/drop, I can't see the container element being dragged
[20:17:44] <bfig> *element. I'm learning as I go
[20:17:54] <oojacoboo> when I drop, there isn't any confirmation
[20:17:56] <oojacoboo> the dropzone is messed up
[20:17:59] <bfig> did you refresh? this was fixed but I commented it because it was possibly a cause of the problem
[20:18:03] <oojacoboo> the overlay index isn't working right with the modal
[20:18:33] <oojacoboo> when I click on Plan de charge, no view is loaded
[20:18:37] <oojacoboo> I have to click on Lundi
[20:18:39] <oojacoboo> there should be a default
[20:18:42] <bfig> the dropzone is messed, you're right, but this is more urgent. The drop logic is the next step in the programming, but part of said programming is the modal dialog :)
[20:19:01] <bfig> yes, that is an issue that I need to solve asap
[20:19:28] <oojacoboo> well, if you have a question, let me know
[20:21:16] <bfig> i still need to make the modal work :(, that is the biggest issue. I'm pretty far out of my zone of comfort with this complex UI. I don't know why all the elements have explicit z-indexes
[20:22:13] <oojacoboo> bfig: search the codebase for "z-index"
[20:22:22] <oojacoboo> find out what js is doing
[20:22:32] <oojacoboo> if you set that at 100 and it wasn't working, then js is doing some funny stuff
[20:22:50] <bfig> it's all knockoutJS
[20:22:54] <oojacoboo> actually
[20:22:56] <oojacoboo> set it to 50
[20:23:00] <oojacoboo> 100 didn't work for me this time...
[20:23:22] <oojacoboo> div.modal-background { z-index: 50; }
[20:23:29] <oojacoboo> div.modal-backdrop { z-index: 50; }
[20:23:34] <bfig> if you manually alter the style, you will see weird behavior
[20:23:41] <oojacoboo> just do it
[20:23:44] <bfig> either it is beyond some stuff or over everything, the break is at 62
[20:23:51] <bfig> ok...
[20:23:54] <oojacoboo> you're so worried about modifying things that it's casuing you to hack in more issues
[20:23:57] <oojacoboo> you're doing things wrong
[20:24:22] <oojacoboo> js shouldn't be mucking with these z-index values either
[20:24:34] <oojacoboo> this is the problem with all these fantastic libs like knockout and bootscrap
[20:26:10] <oojacoboo> bfig: change the location of your modal code
[20:26:14] <bfig> well, to me most JS stuff is magicks. I have a very brittle understanding of everything going on behind it. So many layers of indirection/stuff
[20:26:22] <oojacoboo> it should be at the TOP of your DOM stack
[20:26:27] <bfig> oojacoboo: i have limited control of where the modal appears. I can take it as far up as it is now
[20:26:36] <oojacoboo> nope
[20:26:41] <oojacoboo> top of the DOM stack
[20:26:54] <oojacoboo> you're answer is suppose to be okay - then you do that
[20:27:25] <bfig> because of how the framework works, the elements that I can insert in the page start from the od-pers div
[20:27:34] <oojacoboo> bfig: then you're screwed
[20:27:35] <oojacoboo> sorry
[20:27:41] <oojacoboo> put it in the template
[20:27:45] <oojacoboo> put it at the TOP
[20:27:58] <bfig> it is at the very top (of what I can control)
[20:28:10] <oojacoboo> then get whomever controls the other to fix it
[20:28:36] <oojacoboo> that's your issue - or at least a big piece of it
[20:28:54] <oojacoboo> there are so many issues - it's hard to know where they'll end
[20:29:04] <bfig> hah
[20:30:11] <bfig> I'm optimistic, if you would know how complex the backend code handling this is/will be...
[20:30:54] <oojacoboo> I deal with code that's probably more complex on a daily basis
[20:30:56] <oojacoboo> but I understand
[20:30:59] <oojacoboo> which is all the more reason why it must be clean
[20:31:03] <oojacoboo> this is a nightmare
[20:31:11] <bfig> what do you do for a living?
[20:31:24] <oojacoboo> run a SaaS company
[20:31:28] <bfig> it's not thaat nightmarish... what came before this... *that* was a nightmare
[20:31:40] <bfig> cool
[20:32:44] <bfig> don't know why the droppable offsets are not correctly computed... so much to lean from javascript, it is unfair :/
[20:44:36] <_blizzy_> um, this doesn't seem right. https://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[20:48:35] <_blizzy_> nvm it's supposed to be like that.
[22:23:42] <michael___> Hello?
[22:23:50] <Woet> hello, this is patrick
[22:24:04] <michael___> Can I get some help with some jquery?
[22:24:45] <michael___> focus on a textbox doesn't work in firefox dev build
[22:39:35] <Guest23325> I want to send a PM to the creator of JQuery BBQ.
[22:40:26] <Guest23325> It turns out to have a strange problem when served from a separate domain (in my case, a static, cookie-free URL I've created).
[22:42:03] <Guest23325> When the JQuery BBQ file is served from the separate server, I receive this warning message: "Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help, check http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/"
[22:42:51] <Guest23325> The error is in reference to "xhr.open( options.type, options.url, options.async; options.username, options.password );" in JQuery.
[22:43:53] <Guest23325> Following the rabbit trail in the jquery.js file, the source is "jQuery._evalUrl = function( url ) {     return jQuery.ajax({         url: url,         type: "GET",         dataType: "script",         async: false,         global: false,         "throws": true     }); };"
[22:45:14] <Guest23325> When JQuery BBQ is served from the same server on which my site is run, the error does not occur. It only occurs when I serve the file from the static, cookie-free domain, which is a separate URL. I have no way to determine what's causing this in the JQuery BBQ code.
