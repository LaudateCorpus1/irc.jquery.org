[00:01:58] <SirLagz> Ou42: ok I'm back
[00:03:13] <Ou42> SirLagz: late lunch. :p ( time zone joke ) anyway, just basic q's... new to web dev. so store on the server... since this is a "demo" how far should i take it? should i put some sort of a password mech so ppl can only see their files? or a free for all?
[00:03:50] <SirLagz> Ou42: totally up to you how you do it
[00:04:25] <SirLagz> Ou42: making it a free for all would make it into a pastebin-like webapp
[00:04:49] <SirLagz> Ou42: or making a username/password mechanism would liken it to a very very basic evernote.
[00:05:36] <Ou42> SirLagz: either way i don't have to worry about taking over FB or twitter and shouldn't have to worry about server storage or bandwidth concerns, right?
[00:05:45] <SirLagz> Ou42: yep
[00:07:41] <Ou42> SirLagz: OK, and pardon my public display of ignorance... but in these examples we're not talking a "run in the browser" app... we're talking a client-server thing w/ probably a db on the backend, right?
[00:08:25] <SirLagz> Ou42: I was talking about a 'run in the browser' app
[00:09:08] <SirLagz> Ou42: depends on where you want to go with your skills though
[00:09:19] <Ou42> SirLagz: semantics... i'm trying to differentiate between...
[00:10:07] <Ou42> SirLagz: what I've always thought of ... little cutsie games that just run client side.. but you're talking about saving on the server... so I'd have to learn backend dev too.
[00:10:21] <Ou42> ( which is fine. ) I'm just trying to define terms and get a plan of attack.
[00:10:38] <SirLagz> Ou42: yes. but you could use a webserver like node.js and write everything in javascript.
[00:11:02] <SirLagz> Ou42: since we're in #jquery, I'm assuming you want to learn javascript/jQuery.
[00:11:55] <Ou42> SirLagz: I've been dabbling with jQM to get a Cordova app going. I'm learning that maybe it isn't the easiest way to go about it.
[00:12:07] <Ou42> but I'm am learning
[00:12:49] <SirLagz> Ou42: ok well let's start from the beginning, since I walked in half way through your convo last time
[00:13:05] <SirLagz> Ou42: what are you trying to learn? Javascript? General programming? Webdev?
[00:13:55] <Ou42> SirLagz: yes x 3. I'd like to get a job. But I initially came here for help getting jQ / jQM to work for this app
[00:14:00] <unrecited> never could grasp the javascript / programming covepts
[00:14:01] <unrecited> concepts
[00:14:03] <unrecited> stuck with design
[00:14:20] <Ou42> I just want a job at this point.
[00:14:21] <unrecited> cant get my brain around fact likes nulling out a variable bfeore running a function on it
[00:14:23] <unrecited> just logiically
[00:14:24] <unrecited> a job
[00:14:24] <unrecited> lol
[00:14:33] <SirLagz> Ou42: if you just want a job, get a service desk job
[00:14:52] <Ou42> ah, there's always strings attached.
[00:15:24] <SirLagz> Ou42: strings attached to...?
[00:15:25] <Ou42> so I am a bit picky in that dept. I'd like one where I can learn how to program better. I couldn't define it yesterday and I'll probably bork it tonigtht
[00:15:54] <SirLagz> Service Desk can give you that exposure
[00:16:31] <SirLagz> get a job in an organisation that has a small support team, you'll be more likely to be exposed to basic scripting and stuff
[00:16:41] <Ou42> I"m not fam with that term.... we have "help desk" and "tech support"?
[00:16:43] <SirLagz> Ou42: that way you'll be learning and have a job
[00:16:50] <Ou42> but mainly get ppl's computers working again.
[00:16:58] <SirLagz> Ou42: help desk then
[00:17:17] <SirLagz> Ou42: you just need to find the right place to do help desk
[00:17:25] <SirLagz> Ou42: I learnt all of my javascript while on help desk :P
[00:17:36] * Ou42 is very jealous!
[00:18:24] <SirLagz> Ou42: I learn javascript by building tools for myself while on helpdesk
[00:20:36] <Ou42> SirLagz: that's my dream. I don't know how to define my skillset. How to say, I prefer this or that tech or methodology or "problem solving" . There is just so much to learn.
[00:20:58] <Ou42> SirLagz: so, I have a couple apps in dev. ( sorta ) one for Roku and one for Android ( via Cordova )
[00:21:04] <Ou42> hoping to use them to beef of the resume/cv.
[00:21:11] <Ou42> beef up*
[00:22:42] <unrecited> yeah thats what im doin building still
[00:23:15] <Ou42> unrecited: If I may ask, like what?
[00:23:38] <SirLagz> Ou42: I got a job on helpdesk without any technical skills on my resume
[00:24:00] <SirLagz> Ou42: hell, I was a jeweller before I got that job on help desk. About as far away from IT as you can go and still be at a desk :P
[00:25:19] <Ou42> SirLagz: again, my experience has been time and again, that I'm not qualified and/or I'm not hitting the right places. I applied at a Temp agency ( granted one that wasn't too tech skewed ) and they got me a job in a warehouse. ( after one doing "cable management" )
[00:25:41] <SirLagz> Ou42: what country are you in?
[00:25:51] <Ou42> SirLagz: usa
[00:26:22] <SirLagz> Ou42: all I can suggest is to keep trying while building your stuff then
[00:26:57] <Ou42> SirLagz: any chance your co is looking to hire a new help desk person? :p
[00:27:48] <SirLagz> Ou42: I'm not in USA unfortunately
[00:28:09] <Ou42> free healthcare? :D
[00:28:53] <SirLagz> hah. i wish :P
[00:28:54] <Ou42> SirLagz: appreciate the help. If i get anywhere with my apps/ demos I'll be sure to get back here to share / see more free advice. :p
[00:29:06] <Ou42> gots to go. TTFN
[01:05:10] <bfig> SirLagz: what did you do as a jeweller?
[01:07:41] <SirLagz> bfig: make jewellery
[01:07:56] <SirLagz> bfig: mainly rings and earrings. Was apprenticing as a jeweller before I got my helpdesk job
[01:08:13] <SirLagz> make and repair jewellery
[01:08:22] <SirLagz> wish I had never stopped =/
[01:09:25] <bfig> why?
[01:09:37] <SirLagz> bfig: why did I wish I hadn't stopped ?
[01:09:37] <bfig> sounds cool, anyway
[01:09:42] <bfig> SirLagz: yeah
[01:09:50] <SirLagz> bfig: it was an awesome job...loved doing it
[01:10:07] <SirLagz> bfig: but I was a bit immature at the time...and got impatient and wanted to learn everything before I mastered the basics
[01:10:18] <bfig> we all do
[01:10:41] <SirLagz> but anyway, live and learn. Maybe one day I'll get back into it
[01:11:21] <bfig> is it decent money?
[01:11:32] <SirLagz> bfig: yeah
[01:11:39] <bfig> also, do you like... melt metals and pour them over moulds?
[01:12:17] <SirLagz> bfig: I melted gold, poured it into an ingot mould, then rolled it/hammered it/sawed it/filed it/soldered it into a ring
[01:12:30] <bfig> nice
[01:12:31] <SirLagz> bfig: but the place I worked for also bought pre-rolled ingots
[01:12:56] <bfig> all in a quest for efficiency, it's reasonable
[01:13:18] <SirLagz> dunno if they'd be called ingots cos they were pretty small...but ingots is the only term I can think of for now lol
[01:13:18] <bfig> sounds like a very labour intensive, highly skilled job anyway
[01:14:03] <SirLagz> sure does take a *lot* of practice to get some things right
[01:14:47] <SirLagz> https://wonderjewelers.com/images/basic_settings/basicsetting01.jpg  <-- like making one of those settings from scratch? that was hard.
[01:14:53] <bfig> i like rings, would be cool to make some to order. I have small fingers and it's hard to find stuff that I like :)
[01:15:58] <bfig> looks of a simple variety but tasteful. That's a ring for women, right? ie, small frame, big stone
[01:16:27] <SirLagz> bfig: yeah. generally anything with a small band and a setting is for women
[01:16:46] <SirLagz> gents rings are normally a bit wider and have diamonds set into the band
[01:18:39] <bfig> what's the ring you're most proud of that you've made?
[01:20:35] <bfig> finally my drag and drop is working :D
[01:25:28] <SirLagz> bfig: I don't actually remember lol
[01:25:32] <SirLagz> bfig: it was quite a few years ago
[01:27:11] <bfig> i've always thought, in a different life I'd like to be an artisan, just worrying about my craft
[01:27:30] <bfig> my current craft is... business...ish...
[01:27:40] <bfig> (smb consulting)
[01:29:01] <bfig> not worry about the clients, not have to waste time in coordination, leading a team, training people, dealing with setbacks, death, payments and all kind of ills
[02:25:05] <wannabegeekster> I know this is probably a lame question, but how can I set an input box value to a PHP variable using jquery?
[02:25:38] <wannabegeekster> I want to do this in my $(document).ready(function() { code but not sure how I should go about assigning the PHP variable using javascript.
[02:25:40] <Cork> wannabegeekster: not a lame as you think
[02:26:04] <Cork> wannabegeekster: php runs when the page loads
[02:26:05] <wannabegeekster> Do I just need <?php echo $variable ?> in there when assigning the variable?
[02:26:12] <Cork> so either just set the value in the input field directly
[02:26:24] <Cork> or you would have to make an ajax call to the server to fetch the value
[02:26:33] <wannabegeekster> PHP Runs first and checks to see if a $_SESSION variable is set and if so then pulls data from the database and assigns it to variables.
[02:27:02] <Cork> wannabegeekster: ya, so just set it in the input field from php
[02:27:17] <wannabegeekster> humm.  Ok fair enough.  Sounds easier, I like to over complicate things really.
[02:27:42] <wannabegeekster> cork:  Thanks for pulling head out of rear for me.
[02:27:50] <Cork> heh np :)

[04:12:41] <artisanIndia> can someone please review my code and point me out why I am getting both messages which are initialized on different button clicks
[04:13:00] <Kartagis> Kars-T: you get to drink lots and lots of coffee if you decide to use it, because, you know, coffeescript
[04:13:48] <artisanIndia> here is the code https://jsfiddle.net/mhmfe64g/
[04:14:05] <Kars-T> Katharsis: Okay ;) I did yesterday till 1am and though I am too stupid to read the output. So I am really unsure if its a good idea.

[04:17:54] <artisanIndia> I hve figured it out
[04:35:38] <gtroy> Hey guys! Quick question. I want to change the val of an input. This input has a .change function. So when I change the value, it just erases the value in the input box and doesn't do anything.
[04:36:02] <Cork> gtroy: input events is for user input
[04:36:23] <Cork> gtroy: what i mean by that it is for code to know about user actions
[04:36:29] <Cork> code changes doesn't fire them
[04:36:39] <gtroy> How do I make code changes fire them?
[04:36:43] <Cork> you can manually create fake events
[04:36:49] <Cork> .trigger('change')
[04:36:58] <Cork> so .val(newValue).trigger('change')
[04:41:17] <gtroy> Hm.. it still just get's rid of it..
[04:41:51] <Cork> gtroy: make a jsfiddle with the change handler code
[04:42:12] <gtroy> KK one second.
[04:46:40] <robhol> IMO manually triggering events is kinda... iffy
[04:46:58] <gtroy> Hey Cork, Do you have github?
[04:47:07] <gtroy> It's a flask server... So it's hard for me to do all of this
[04:47:17] <gtroy> on jsfiddle
[04:47:29] <Cork> gtroy: just include the js code from the change handler
[04:47:38] <Cork> the rest isn't needed
[04:48:04] <Cork> well the code that sets the new value might help, but isn't needed
[04:48:10] <gtroy> http://jsfiddle.net/z3xLzj93/
[04:48:21] <Cork> basically i need to see what the change event handler does
[04:48:24] <gtroy> It's just the javascript part that I'm having error on. Assume i did DOM
[04:50:02] <Cork> gtroy: hmm, what part isn't working?
[04:50:09] <Cork> that code looks like it should work just fine
[04:50:31] <Cork> btw the way you use classes indicate that you should use ids instead
[04:50:48] <gtroy> Hmm, I'll keep that in mind thanks!
[04:50:50] <Cork> well at least .search
[04:51:14] <gtroy> So, whenever I change the input with that "fake event" it still clears the input, it doesn't do .change()
[04:51:47] <gtroy> I can give you a website you can go to and try to go through it?
[04:52:36] <Cork> gtroy: so line 28 echos the correct values
[04:52:52] <Cork> and line 29 actually sets the correct field with the value?
[04:52:58] <Cork> (you've checked this?)
[04:53:08] <Cork> but the change event on line 1 never fires?
[04:53:19] <Cork> that makes no sense
[04:55:07] <gtroy> Hmm.. Let me go back to the drawing board for a bit Cork... I think i have to think about this a bit more.
[04:55:25] <gtroy> It is triggering, it must be another part....
[04:55:30] <gtroy> Thanks for your help so far
[04:55:56] <Cork> gtroy: do you have more then one element matching $('.search') ?
[04:56:17] <Cork> console.log($('.search').length)
[04:59:49] <gtroy> No, I think I figured out that 		var new_search = $(this).val(); part is not returning anything.. So I gotta fix that..
[05:00:36] <Cork> gtroy: what kind of element is "newsearch"?
[05:05:11] <gtroy> Anchor
[05:05:15] <Cork> ah
[05:05:23] <Cork> and you want the visible text?
[05:05:57] <Cork> (of the anchor)
[05:06:34] <gtroy> Yes
[05:06:55] <Cork> then you want var new_search = $(this).text();
[05:07:52] <gtroy> I owe you so much Cork.
[05:07:56] <gtroy> You fixed my problem
[05:07:58] <gtroy> Thank you so muc

[06:23:46] <jani___> hello
[06:23:47] <jani___> is there any in javascript to change the value of some variable in a javascript file on run time and then persist that value in that file permanently ( the file will be on server)
[06:24:08] <jani___> I want a solution in pure javascript or jquery
[06:24:32] <jani___> is there any thing possible in js/
[06:33:04] <Cork> jani___: no, javascript runs in the visitors browser
[06:33:18] <Cork> it doesn't have ways to modify information server side
[06:33:23] <Cork> and shouldn't have it
[06:33:43] <Cork> jani___: what you can do is either push the value to the server and it stores it in ex. sql
[06:33:54] <Cork> jani___: or you can store it locally in the browser
[06:36:26] <jani___> I want to store that value (which is dynamic from database) in the js file and then update that file on the server
[06:36:33] <jani___> is it possible in js?
[06:43:10] <Cork> jani___: no, not from js
[06:43:25] <Cork> again js can't modify the server info
[06:43:37] <Cork> jani___: you can expose server apis to do it
[06:43:43] <Cork> but you need to do it from the server, not from js
[06:44:26] <jani___> do you know any server apis which can be used for that?
[06:46:44] <robhol> the one you're going to be writing ;p
[06:47:52] <robhol> If all you want to do is store some data, there's local storage in Javascript, but if you need to "share" the value with other clients, the server needs to be involved and your app needs to provide the mechanism by which that value can be stored/updated
[06:53:26] <arup_r> Hi, I am using http://www.dropzonejs.com/#configuration-options .. I have a form and lot of input elements inside it. And I want the user to upload the file using pick and drop. But now the issues is, whenever I am dropping, the form is being submitted by Ajaxm which I don't want. How to stop it ? I want user will fill other elements and pick and drop an image here in the dropzone and submit the form manually

[07:30:18] <morfar> the acccept selector seems to bubble up to grid-item
[07:34:45] <Cork> morfar: the simplest solution is prob not to nest those element
[07:37:33] <nehaljwani> Hi! How can I remove the redundant code from: http://fpaste.org/292725/44802276/
[07:38:14] <taplar> nehaljwani: just extract it to a named function
[07:38:19] <taplar> or variable
[07:38:35] <nehaljwani> taplar: there is a difference in line 14 and 33
[07:38:41] <nehaljwani> otherwise I would have done that.
[07:39:18] <taplar> you should be able to check the event for the type
[07:39:21] <taplar> to know what to do
[07:39:40] <taplar> otherwise you could call that function in an anonymous function that passes in some argument that lets you know
[07:40:10] <taplar> event check would be cleaner
[07:40:30] <nehaljwani> could you give an example? I an n00b when it comes to jquery
[07:40:57] <taplar> actually, does the element start with not having that class?
[07:41:20] <taplar> you might could just change it to toggleClass
[07:42:17] <arup_r> After uploading a file or dropping an image the original image is getting blurred. Can this be handled ? http://jsfiddle.net/ELcf6/8/
[07:42:18] <nehaljwani> it may or maynot have that class
[07:45:23] <nehaljwani> taplar: got it. thanks
[07:46:49] <taplar> cool
[07:47:21] <Cork> nehaljwani: this is another option http://jsfiddle.net/vxex0mjm/3/
[07:47:43] <taplar> did you mean morfar?
[07:47:48] <Cork> opps
[07:47:52] <Cork> ya, mixed up the nicks
[07:47:59] <Cork> morfar: http://jsfiddle.net/vxex0mjm/3/
[07:48:05] <Cork> if you still want to nest them
[07:48:11] <taplar> heh, for a sec i was like, wow, you really reduced his logic
[07:48:19] <Cork> morfar: also you might want to check into sortable
[07:48:30] <Cork> it might solve what you're trying to do in a nicer way
[07:48:39] <morfar> Cork, thanks will check this out.
[07:48:48] <Cork> haven't even read his code :x
[07:49:35] <Cork> nehaljwani: btw this.parentNode.className.match(/\d+/) ugg
[07:49:47] <Cork> use a data-sentence="" instead
[07:49:50] <Cork> much cleaner
[07:50:06] <nehaljwani> Cork:  I didn't understand
[07:50:10] <nehaljwani> what is data-sentence
[07:50:23] <Cork> currently you regex grab text from the class name
[07:50:28] <nehaljwani> right
[07:50:35] <Cork> instead store the value you want in a dedicated attribute
[07:50:42] <nehaljwani> oh
[07:50:44] <Cork> <elm data-sentence="the value you want">
[07:51:14] <nehaljwani> Are there some rules to be followed while creating custom attributes?
[07:51:25] <Cork> they should always begin with data-
[07:51:26] * nehaljwani apologizes for asking n00b questions
[07:51:40] <Cork> the data- namespace is reserved by spec
[07:51:49] <nehaljwani> Okay. Thanks
[07:51:52] <Cork> and won't ever conflict with future attribute names
[07:51:52] <nehaljwani> Will use that
[07:52:56] <Cork> nehaljwani: and the for loop could be converted to a fairly simple .filter()
[07:53:45] <Cork> though preferably you should select those by class instead of what they contain
[07:54:07] <taplar> oh, ln 13 32 your doing an assignment rather than a comparison
[07:54:37] <nehaljwani> Cork: if I use .filter() how would I match the reqOccurence
[07:54:44] <nehaljwani> taplar: yeah, I rectified that :P
[07:55:54] <taplar> if i understand the logic, it would be an .eq(reqOccurance) off of the filter
[07:56:15] <Cork> nehaljwani: .filter(function() { $(this).text() == srcWord; }).eq(regOccurance).addClass();
[07:57:00] <nehaljwani> How does this work : .eq(regOccurance) :-o
[07:57:15] <taplar> it gets the n'th element of the stack
[07:57:41] <nehaljwani> This is pretty new
[07:57:46] <nehaljwani> for me
[07:58:02] <taplar> eq() is like [] except eq() will keep the element as a jquery object
[07:58:29] <nehaljwani> Ah. Now I understand
[07:59:01] <nehaljwani> You guys are so cool. Telling me about mistakes that I never asked you about :)
[07:59:12] <taplar> it's a teaching room
[07:59:54] <nehaljwani> So, let's say I pass down the event as variable evt inside the function
[08:00:08] <nehaljwani> Then in the above construct, where will I check the value of the evt.type ?
[08:00:35] <taplar> you'd get your filter results, then check the event type to know weither to do add or remove class
[08:00:39] <nehaljwani> oh, I can check before and write this construct twice
[08:00:45] <nehaljwani> cool
[08:01:28] <Cork> mehyou could also to toggleClass('limit-highlight', evt.type == '<value that should set the class>')
[08:01:32] <Cork> opps
[08:01:37] <Cork> nehaljwani: you could *
[08:01:56] <Cork> so no you don't have to duplicate the code
[08:02:35] <taplar> interesting.  i was thinking of a variable for the filter results and then an if/else on the type
[08:10:58] <nehaljwani> for some weird reason it is sending me empty object
[08:11:29] <Cork> nehaljwani: i forgot the return in the filter function
[08:11:40] <Cork> it should have been return $(this).text() ==
[08:12:15] <nehaljwani> Oh yes, that worked!!
[08:30:03] <nehaljwani> are all html tags case insensitive?
[08:30:34] <taplar> i think so
[08:31:07] <taplar> as far as the markup is concerned
[08:31:13] <taplar> not sure about selectors
[08:31:15] <nehaljwani> s/tags/attribute
[08:31:15] <b-ot> Correction, <nehaljwani> are all html attribute case insensitive?
[08:31:25] <taplar> no
[08:31:33] <nehaljwani> example?
[08:31:46] <taplar> data tags in markup you'll have to lookup all lowercase
[08:32:05] <taplar> data-myName="" would be $selector.data('myname')
[08:32:18] <nehaljwani> exactly my question.
[08:42:08] <nehaljwani> So, earlier, I was doing: $(sentenceID + '.translator-input').children().. now that I have sentenceID as the attribute data-sentenceid, how do I get that object?
[08:43:03] <taplar> $(selector).data('sentenceid') will be your original sentenceID
[08:47:13] <nehaljwani> taplar: but many elements have that attribute
[08:47:20] <nehaljwani> it seems to return only one
[08:48:29] <taplar> lets see your logic
[08:49:16] <nehaljwani> given a $sentenceid, I want to get the element which belongs to the class '.translator-input' and has the attribute data-sentenceid=$sentenceid
[08:50:16] <taplar> $('.translator-input').filter('[data-sentenceid="'+ sentenceid +'"]')
[08:51:20] <nehaljwani> Ah.. yes ofc
[08:51:27] <nehaljwani> but i don't think .filter is required
[08:51:37] <nehaljwani> $('.translator-input[data-sentenceid=" + sentenceid + "]')
[08:51:42] <taplar> filter is better
[08:52:05] <taplar> you don't want to stick that much logic through the lookup if possible
[08:52:15] <taplar> especially data lookups
[08:52:42] <nehaljwani> okay
[09:04:52] <hellyeah> actually my plan is to show dashed horizontal line when the number inside the button is not equal to zero.. In order to see result i show horizontal line  when it is equal to zero. i try to add horizontal line to the button in line 15 but only last  button has horzontal line. What is the reason of that? Can you help me? http://jsfiddle.net/0wy6zgsu
[09:04:52] <hellyeah> /119/
[09:05:46] <taplar> uh, i see no logic
[09:05:53] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:06:27] <hellyeah> hmm first thing i tried is to make border dotted
[09:06:35] <hellyeah> does that sound logical?
[09:06:44] <hellyeah> or hmm
[09:06:52] <hellyeah> increasing opacity is enough i guess
[09:06:57] <taplar> i have no idea.  again.  i don't see any logic in that link other than console logs
[09:07:31] <hellyeah> these are counters
[09:07:50] <hellyeah> when you click button yo seee the table
[09:08:00] <hellyeah> and counters show how many records are problematic
[09:16:44] <hellyeah> okey i did something else
[09:17:27] <hellyeah> taplar: does it make sense ? when the counter inside the button is not 0 increase opacity of button http://jsfiddle.net/0wy6zgsu/120/
[09:18:47] <taplar> so your trying to make the buttons more prominent if they have a number
[09:19:11] <hellyeah> yes
[09:19:24] <taplar> might work
[09:19:29] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:19:40] <hellyeah> is there any other suggestion you can give me?
[09:20:19] <taplar> nothing it coming to me right now.  i'd just say try it.  i'd have to see a finished example to get a better feel for if it
[09:20:42] <hellyeah> hope it will finish soon
[09:21:13] <hellyeah> these are what i have so far
[09:22:12] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/u1pdhk8c/271/embedded/result/ and  http://jsfiddle.net/ndrcemrk/17/embedded/result/ have to combines ideas here
[09:22:22] <hellyeah> brb
[09:22:35] <hellyeah> i need to smoke xD
[09:22:38] <hellyeah> xD
[09:24:22] <taplar> in the first one the little yellow unlabeled buttons are weird
[09:25:10] <taplar> there's no indication of what they do.  you have to click them to see what they do.  not very good ui/ux
[09:42:46] <rindolf> Meow, all! Sup?
[10:04:04] <davesidious> Hey folks - how can I convert a specific element's position to be relative, and still keep it's width/height/position, etc. so it looks the same?
[10:04:24] <davesidious> I want to raise a given element to a certain z-index so I can insert a div underneath it to catch click events outside of it.
[10:11:45] <sisccl> Is there a way to make an element clickable without <a>, and if I do have to use <a> is there a way to remove the # that is thrown into the header using JQuery?  To be specific it’s for a dropdown menu I made
[10:12:21] <SirLagz> sisccl: you can make anything clickable with an onclick handler
[10:12:41] <sisccl> I’m sorry, that was horrible phrasing, let me re-phrase
[10:13:05] <sisccl> I specifically want the pointer that appears that indicates something is clickable along with it without having to use <a> tags
[10:13:16] <SirLagz> sisccl: javascript/jquery + css
[10:13:41] <davesidious> sisccl: "cursor: pointer" will give you that pointer.
[10:13:52] <sisccl> davesidious: This was the ansewr I was looking for, thanks
[10:13:52] <SirLagz> davesidious: thanks. Was just looking it up lol
[10:14:03] <davesidious> :)
[10:17:51] <hellyeah> yo
[10:18:03] <hellyeah> i am sorry why i didnt see buttons here line 51-69 http://jsfiddle.net/0wy6zgsu/124/
[11:54:18] <_Noobie_> Can I use jquery to scan a directory and sub directories and list the urls?
[12:04:39] <rindolf> _Noobie_: hi.
[12:04:56] <rindolf> _Noobie_: jQuery works inside the browser usually.
[12:06:42] <_Noobie_> Yeah.  I was just going to create a file to create a small sitemap for a section of my site.
[12:16:55] <arc_> this is a bit off topic, but ... i was looking at how feasible it would be to modify the asuswrt interface with a user style, and ... i can't believe some of what i'm seeing. they have a navigation menu with images and text labels, which are laid out using an individual table inside each menu element -_-
[12:18:24] <noahmg123> is there a quick way to create an array that counts up until a certain number? (i.e. var countingArray = $.countArray(5); //countingArray is [1,2,3,4,5])?
[12:25:39] <Uhkis> noahmg123: just write the function yourself
[12:26:03] <noahmg123> Uhkis: I was asking if such a thing exists.
[12:26:15] <noahmg123> I am trying to avoid writing a for loop
[12:26:45] <rindolf> Oh, _Noobie_ left.
[12:28:00] <AbuDhar> anyone who can help me?
[12:28:03] <AbuDhar> seriously guys :/
[12:28:08] <rindolf> AbuDhar: hi, with what?
[12:28:11] <Uhkis> noahmg123: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3895478/does-javascript-have-a-method-like-range-to-generate-an-array-based-on-suppl pick your poison :D
[12:28:12] <AbuDhar> TypeError: window.initMap is not a function
[12:28:26] <AbuDhar> I get this... because Google Maps is loaded before my JS file I think
[12:28:36] <AbuDhar> how can I make sure the js file is loaded after?
[12:28:43] <AbuDhar> or before
[12:28:51] <AbuDhar> I mean
[12:38:29] <sigdk> I'm using Steps (http://www.jquery-steps.com/) and I want to populate a dropdown menu in my form with data I fetch from a running servlet in the background... where exactly and how should I trigger the request ?
[12:40:56] <taplar_> sigdk: when do you want the dropdown populated?
[12:41:34] <sigdk> taplar_, step 1, I have a form and I want to let the user choose from one of some options
[12:42:32] <rindolf> AbuDhar: I see.
[12:42:53] <taplar> sigdk: so on the very first step your wanting to build the selection?
[12:43:28] <rindolf> AbuDhar: you can try checking for the existence of window.initMap and proceeding only if it's defined.
[12:43:44] <sigdk> taplar, yes
[12:44:09] <taplar> sigdk: is there a reason you cannot have your selection built statically in the html?
[12:44:48] <taplar> or dynamically constructed if your using some form of servlet pages
[12:45:57] <sigdk> taplar, imagine a user has to choose a friend between of other users in the system. The latter can change any time... so it can't be static
[12:46:17] <taplar> ok, i was just curious, :)
[12:46:34] <taplar> so before you display the selection you'd want to do an ajax call to get that information
[12:46:49] <sigdk> exactly
[12:46:53] <taplar> yup
[12:47:12] <rindolf> AbuDhar: maybe try https://duckduckgo.com/?q=javascript%20loading%20order
[12:47:12] <taplar> so... what's confusing you
[12:53:41] <sigdk> taplar_brb_quick, I tried to do something like this: http://paste.debian.net/334381/   but it doesn't seem to work...
[12:57:00] <taplar> you'll most likely want that outside of your initialize
[12:57:03] <taplar> and just do it on page load
[12:57:16] <taplar> as part of your document ready
[12:58:23] <taplar> and your ajax won't return a result
[12:58:30] <taplar> you'll want to do a success callback on it
[12:58:48] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[13:00:51] <taplar> ah, you have a success. i missed that
[13:04:15] <sigdk> taplar, ok, let me see
[13:04:18] <sigdk> thanks
[14:25:31] <abishek> is there a way to setup a jquery draggable on a element sitting under another lement?
[14:25:36] <abishek> element*
[14:29:29] <NoiseEee> presuming one sets up draggables via code, i can't see why not?
[14:41:59] <quarters> hi
[14:42:14] <quarters> for some reason, when I'm trying to create a slideshow, my next image seems to fade in before my current image completed fading out.  How do I address this issue?
[14:42:23] <quarters> the lines I currently have are $('.foo').find('img').first().fadeOut(1000); $('.foo').find('img').first().next().fadeIn(1000);
[14:44:18] <quarters> I was thinking of setting up an if statement if($('.foo').find('img').first().css('display') == 'none'){ //fadein next image}
[14:44:43] <quarters> I just feel there's a more jquery-ish way of doing this
[15:10:01] <hellyeah> hey there
[15:11:37] <hellyeah> i just want to add this three circles to each div but something happened weirdly can you help meto figure out why http://jsfiddle.net/0wy6zgsu/131/
[15:13:28] <taplar> hellyeah: your bottom for each is re-wrapping jquery objects like crazy
[15:13:45] <hellyeah> yeah it is crazty
[15:13:58] <taplar> lol, so fix it
[15:14:03] <hellyeah> :X
[15:14:48] <taplar> quarters: what part are you wanting to do more jqueryish?
[15:15:50] <quarters> taplar: I'm wondering if there's a built in method for what I'm trying to do in jquery
[15:16:05] <quarters> but I'm just reinventing the wheel w/my code
[15:16:14] <quarters> in a clunkier way
[15:16:35] <taplar> fade out the first element, then fade in the second?
[15:17:01] <quarters> exactly, but only after the first element finishes fading out would the 2nd one start fading in
[15:17:33] <quarters> maybe not a function that does EXACTLy that but some sort of timing jquery method
[15:17:39] <taplar> fadeOut and fadeIn take an optional function as the second argument that gets called when the animation finishes
[15:17:52] <quarters> oh
[15:18:00] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/fadeOut/
[15:18:09] <quarters> awesome!
[15:18:14] <quarters> thanks!
[15:18:18] <hellyeah> yrep
[15:18:24] <hellyeah> i fixed that http://jsfiddle.net/0wy6zgsu/132/
[15:18:46] <taplar> your still doing
[15:18:48] <taplar> *it
[15:19:10] <hellyeah> what
[15:19:22] <taplar> -anywhere- you see $($something) is most likely re-wrapping
[15:19:23] <hellyeah> crazy still?
[15:19:40] <taplar> otherwise the $ on the variable name is meaningless
[15:20:06] <hellyeah> hhm
[15:20:57] <hellyeah> ic
[15:24:45] <hellyeah> taplar: i need to put that circles onto button. Is it correct to do like that i mean addin both to division or do i need to add counterClass to button as child? http://jsfiddle.net/0wy6zgsu/133/
[15:25:59] <taplar> you mean make the button look like the circle?
[15:26:13] <hellyeah> no
[15:26:15] <hellyeah> i mean
[15:26:35] <hellyeah> i need this appearence http://jsfiddle.net/ndrcemrk/17/embedded/result/
[15:26:54] <hellyeah> square button and circle button that interscted
[15:27:22] <taplar> that looks bad
[15:28:01] <quarters> when I try $('.foo').find('img').first().fadeIn(1000,$('.foo').find('img').first().fadeOut(1000)), I get a b.easing[this.easing] is not a function error
[15:28:19] <taplar> quarters: it's expecting a function definition, not a function invocation
[15:28:26] <hellyeah> looks bad?
[15:28:44] <hellyeah> it was amateur attempt :XD
[15:28:51] <quarters> taplar: gotcha
[15:28:54] <taplar> quarters: look at the docs in the examples.  one has a comment about animation complete
[15:28:54] <quarters> thank you
[15:29:06] <taplar> hellyeah: your overlaying display elements on an input field
[15:29:24] <taplar> not sure why you would want to do that
[15:29:39] <hellyeah> hmm this is the idea
[15:29:46] <hellyeah> now i try to write a better code
[15:29:56] <hellyeah> this is design my manager wants
[15:30:04] <taplar> hit him
[15:30:06] <taplar> hard
[15:30:45] <taplar> there's not reason to place display elements on top of a user interface element
[15:31:12] <hellyeah> that shows the amount of records in the table
[15:31:22] <taplar> you can do that without overlaying the interface
[15:31:29] <hellyeah> hmm
[15:31:39] <hellyeah> if you have something pls lay onto me
[15:31:55] <taplar> just don't overlay the button
[15:31:58] <taplar> lol, that's it
[15:32:03] <hellyeah> ah
[15:32:12] <hellyeah> i supposed there is another way
[15:32:16] <hellyeah> i kinda have to
[15:32:18] <hellyeah> eheheh
[15:32:23] <taplar> why?
[15:32:45] <hellyeah> why because this is the design here and i have to do that
[15:32:56] <quarters> so I tried $('.foo').find('img').first().fadeIn(1000,function(){$('.foo').find('img').first().fadeOut(1000)}) and I get no error, but no fadeout.
[15:32:58] <taplar> what is the benifit to the user of obstructing to any degree the user's ability to use an input?
[15:32:59] <hellyeah> you remember i asked for button instead of scroll bar
[15:33:30] <hellyeah> he wants to know the amount of records in the table
[15:33:37] <hellyeah> so that all i can say
[15:33:53] <taplar> nothing about that statement says the amounts have to be on top of the button
[15:34:22] <taplar> your making it sound like if they are not, then you have no idea the numbers relate to that button
[15:34:58] <hellyeah> actually that sounds like non-sense
[15:35:05] <hellyeah> when i think about it really
[15:35:25] <hellyeah> why it is important to know how many records are problematic in the table
[15:35:34] <hellyeah> you just animate the button and thats it
[15:35:53] <hellyeah> my table is ordered red, orange, gray, green, blue
[15:35:59] <taplar> i don't know about that part.  i'm just talking about the ui layout
[15:36:13] <hellyeah> i got it
[15:36:29] <hellyeah> i try to say this  counter idea doesnt make sense much
[15:36:30] <quarters> nm, I just used $(this) to solve it
[15:36:46] <taplar> quarters: ah, good, i was fixing to suggest something but you beat me
[15:37:37] <taplar> hellyeah: i could see the numbers being there possibly
[15:37:47] <taplar> but stick them to the right of the button or something
[15:38:08] <quarters> taplar: thank you. I'm really glad I got this one 'on my own'(ie lucky guess)
[15:38:13] <hellyeah> to the right hmm
[15:38:24] <hellyeah> you have three circle
[15:38:31] <hellyeah> you have enough space?
[15:39:51] <taplar_> hellyeah: the button is ruffly 103px, and the numbers part is a little bigger than that.  Are your users operating on a screen displaying less than 300px?
[15:40:12] <taplar_> the table that displays when you click the button is a h*** of a lot longer than that
[15:40:47] <taplar_> *wider
[15:41:02] <hellyeah> honestly i dont have an idea
[15:41:18] <hellyeah> hmm
[15:41:29] <hellyeah> buttons will have own place
[15:41:33] <hellyeah> div
[15:49:32] <hellyeah> something is really fantasy
[15:50:02] <hellyeah> i am not even sure they will use every idea that i wrote/writing/ will write
[15:50:13] <hellyeah> but days are so tough here
[15:50:35] <hellyeah> everyone live with a threat  "lose a job"
[15:52:08] <taplar> all the more reason to strive for a quality result
[15:52:55] <hellyeah> yeah
[15:53:12] <hellyeah> you are right it is 22:30 p.m. i am at work thats why
[15:53:26] <hellyeah> btw i am telling some ideas to my manager
[15:53:38] <hellyeah> sometimes my manager insisted me for doing something
[15:53:46] <hellyeah> so iam jusr regular worker anyway
[15:53:46] <quarters> I want my code to stay in an infinite loop without a stack overflow and I was wondering how to fix it: pastebin.com/WcpuWgrA
[15:55:30] <taplar> quarters: take a look at setInterval and setTimeout
[15:56:21] <quarters> taplar: I thought that the timer in fadeIn and fadeOut precluded the need for using those functions
[15:56:44] <quarters> because I want the animation to be exactly 5000ms per image
[15:56:46] <hellyeah> they say setInterval not so good choice
[15:57:06] <quarters> inclusive of both fading in and out
[15:57:07] <taplar> setInterval or setTimeout would be an alternative to the while (true) approach, which you could later clear when you want it to stop
[15:57:10] <hellyeah> fadeIn fadeOut must have duration parameter or smt
[15:57:47] <taplar> just as an option.  are you getting an out of mem error?
[15:57:48] <quarters> taplar: will using setinterval or settimeout add more time to the animation?
[15:58:16] <quarters> I'm definitely open to that option.  I just want to be able to use it while complying w/the time restriction spec
[15:58:20] <taplar> you could set the time to match the fade time so it shouldn't change it
[15:58:21] <hellyeah> it will repeat
[15:58:48] <taplar> actually your interval time would be double your fade since your doing your fade twice
[15:59:10] <quarters> taplar: I don't know. I just see overflow as the error msg
[15:59:16] <quarters> this is in firefox
[15:59:36] <quarters> I imagine other browser consoles will issue identical errors
[15:59:53] <taplar> probably cause the loop is happening so fast
[16:00:15] <taplar> yeah, i'd recommend interval or timeout
[16:00:55] <quarters> aah the timer in the fadeinn and fadeout methods don't delay the loop then
[16:01:02] <taplar> no, it's async
[16:01:13] <taplar> ish
[16:01:42] <quarters> gotcha
[16:01:56] <taplar> or, better approach
[16:02:09] <taplar> fadein
[16:02:17] <taplar> on done of fade in, fade out
[16:02:29] <taplar> on done of fade out call function to start process for next element
[16:02:37] <quarters> so should I implement my oown fadein and fadeout to be able to use settimeout or setinterval w/out affecting the animation duration?
[16:02:54] <taplar> i'd actually do something like my last two statements
[16:02:59] <quarters> ah, or that
[16:03:08] <taplar> let the done of the second fade start the first fade of the next element
[16:03:20] <taplar> the very last one starting the fade for the first to form the loop
[16:03:53] <taplar> anyway, i'm out for the weekend.  don't work too hard you guys, :)
[16:04:07] <quarters> thanks a lot, taplar .  have a great wknnnnnnnnnnnnd!
[16:04:14] <quarters> er...stupid linux
[16:04:18] <quarters> or vmware
[16:04:27] <taplar> yeah.  and hellyeah fight the power!!! :)
[16:04:46] <quarters> didn't send the keyup event until 10 "n" 's later
[16:04:57] <taplar> heh
[16:05:27] <hellyeah> people prefer setTimeout instead of setInterval
[16:05:35] <hellyeah> you need to check that
[16:05:47] <quarters> ok
[16:17:24] <quarters> if I have imgs = $('.foo').children() with 2 children, how come $('.foo').children().first().next() will never equal $('.foo').children().last()?
[16:17:57] <quarters> I was hoping to iterate through the children to have it loop again
[16:18:41] <quarters> indefinitely
[16:19:53] <huck5> I have a group of Radio buttons. When I select one of them, there is not ":select" added to the html tag... How can I tell which of the radio buttons is selected?
[16:19:59] <huck5> using jquery/js*
[16:25:20] <huck5> I realized that my radio buttons have an attributed "checked" not "selected", so in my cause using `$(this).is(":checked")` was my solution.
[16:27:06] <shoky> this.checked
[17:07:05] <asidjazz> you can do this.checked?
[17:07:12] <asidjazz> is that even jquery?
[17:07:15] <asidjazz> its not
[17:07:20] <asidjazz> is that compatibre
[17:08:08] <shoky> wat?
[17:08:30] <shoky> it's compatible sure.. IE5 even, probably ;p
[17:08:37] <silenthush> Howdy. I got a question
[17:11:15] <silenthush> I've got this horizontal slider that I'm trying to make with 2 left-right controllers. When a user clicks on the right controller, I want the slide to move to the left with the amount of 'px' based on the 1 visible item of the slider. So that when the slider slides to the next item, the amount of px it takes to slide equals the exact width of the first visible item on the left so that the sliding is equal and not with a static 'px'
[17:11:17] <silenthush>  like a constant margin-left of 300px for example since the items in the slide vary in width.
[17:11:28] <silenthush> 1 = 1st
[17:11:54] <silenthush> Any idea how I can make that happen?
[17:12:39] <silenthush> so far I'm using a simple $('.slide-left').animate({'margin-left' : '+=300px'}); on click.
