[04:26:17] <anli> Is it only me or has google chrome started to have a delay before autofill?
[04:26:21] <anli> Since some days ago
[04:53:57] <sine`> Morning folks.
[04:54:43] <sine`> preloading images means all the http requests are done on page load and not as the image transition happens right ? I have never had to think about this before
[04:55:37] <Cork> sine`: it meas it happens when you do the preload
[04:56:00] <sine`> ok sure *whenever* that may be
[05:09:49] <Duikb00t> hi
[05:09:59] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/xr98fbed/  anyone an idea why my filename won'tb be set when I select a file :s
[05:23:44] <Cork> Duikb00t: if the target is the file input you can't use .val()
[05:24:02] <Cork> you need to use .files[number].filename if i remember correctly
[05:24:11] <thykka> sine`, re: 'is there some way I can find these errors'; Yes, a few ways. You could use a HTML validator, or an editor/plugin that continuously checks the markup (i.e. a linter)
[05:24:20] <Duikb00t> Made a little improvement: https://jsfiddle.net/b15jhw82/2/
[05:24:30] <thykka> idk about notepad++, but Atom, VS Code and SublimeText all have such plugins
[05:24:31] <Duikb00t> The counter went crazy but now that one is back ok.
[05:24:47] <Duikb00t> now it's only the .val() of the filename that should be set on the right cloned upload.
[05:25:42] <Cork> Duikb00t: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File
[05:25:51] <Cork> that is what you need to use
[05:31:01] <Duikb00t> so confused damimt
[05:32:22] <Cork> Duikb00t: file inputs don't work like normal inputs
[05:32:32] <Cork> it isn't a text value you can grab from .value on the element
[05:32:55] <Cork> you need to use the files list on the element, as it contains the files assigned to the input field
[05:33:27] <Duikb00t> OK so far I understand in words what that means , meanwhile my counter is broken when I clone >< ffs
[05:33:36] <Duikb00t> >< https://jsfiddle.net/4arcf0zw/2/
[05:33:54] <Duikb00t> I even get the filename.
[05:36:59] <thykka> Duikb00t, https://jsfiddle.net/thykka/nLc2e049/
[05:39:30] <thykka> Duikb00t, also, I don't know why you have the "+ Add another one" button, as a file input can be made to select multiple files at once
[05:39:56] <Duikb00t> yeah I don't want that latest option
[05:40:05] <Duikb00t> People don't always know that.
[05:40:18] <Duikb00t> And for this my target audience won't know :D
[05:40:30] <Duikb00t> Just wondering if I still need:
[05:40:32] <Duikb00t>             .data('filename-target', '#filename[' + inputCount + ']')
[05:40:33] <thykka> you
[05:40:34] <Duikb00t> that data
[05:40:58] <thykka> you already have an info text, why not change it to inform about selecting multiple files
[05:41:16] <Duikb00t> I need to do it with this setup.
[05:41:18] <thykka> no, you can get filenames from the files object
[05:41:31] <Duikb00t> Yeah I konw :p
[05:41:39] <Duikb00t> files.0.name
[05:41:43] <Duikb00t> but
[05:41:55] <Duikb00t> blegh it's not appending to that 'input' which should render it
[05:42:09] <thykka> render what? the file?
[05:42:36] <Duikb00t> This:         console.log(lastIndex)
[05:42:38] <Duikb00t> the name
[05:42:41] <Duikb00t> 'bestandsnaam'
[05:42:57] <Duikb00t> I want to show the filenam eof the file which you have selected
[05:43:34] <Cork> Duikb00t: if you want to have a custom ui for the file picker you should just hide it completely and set what you want in a normal input or a span or something
[05:44:14] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/e162sux3/4/
[05:44:16] <Duikb00t> like that
[05:44:23] <Duikb00t> and put in the span ethe
[05:44:25] <Duikb00t> Files.0.name
[05:45:05] <Duikb00t> Sorry files is not easy or me :-D
[05:45:33] <thykka> did you read this? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File/Using_files_from_web_applications
[05:46:10] <thykka> there's an example of most of the different things you're doing in your fiddle
[06:17:58] <Duikb00t> Still fighting
[06:18:00] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/e162sux3/24/
[06:18:02] <Duikb00t> trying to use files
[06:22:59] <thykka> doesn't look like you're using it much
[06:26:11] <Duikb00t> it's har.d
[06:33:01] <thykka> anything in particular you're finding troublesome?
[07:29:27] <Duikb00t> restart = true
[08:38:49] <sine`> hey guys, with jquery ajax submit data, this is working for me (i will sort out validation etc) but is there anything im doing wrong: https://bpaste.net/show/e38d01e19976
[10:20:40] <MikeD_> i have a delegated handler .on('blur', 'input', function(evt){ /* etc. */} )  and i tabbed out of the input and i've got a stream of focusOut events ... i don't know what's happening
[11:16:07] <MikeD_> i had two focus handlers assigned in different places and somehow that caused Bad Things
[13:43:27] <PettanShoutaKun> How can I find all the event listeners attached to a $('#element') in jQuery 2.1.3?
[13:44:05] <robertmaxrees> why not just use your dev tools to look that up?
[13:45:00] <PettanShoutaKun> I can but there's on event being attached by a particular minified JS script and I want to remove it programatically.
[13:45:13] <PettanShoutaKun> it's attached by an anonymous function so I have no reference to remove it with.
[13:45:28] <robertmaxrees> then you'll have to wholesale remove all event handlers.
[13:45:37] <robertmaxrees> without a reference to the original handler, you're SOL.
[13:45:45] <PettanShoutaKun> I thought maybe I could crawl through all the events and remove it that way by identifying the file it came from or something, but I haven't found a way to do so. :/
[13:45:50] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:45:54] <PettanShoutaKun> When I tried var element = document.querySelector('#process'), theEvents = $._data(element, "events"); I just get undefined.
[13:45:58] <PettanShoutaKun> and well damn....
[13:46:13] <PettanShoutaKun> I actually do have the unminified.... js... I could actually rip it out there and reminify it :O
[13:46:26] <robertmaxrees> is it a library of some kind?
[13:46:45] <robertmaxrees> seems silly to modify the code when it sounds like you don't want it in the first place.
[13:46:52] <PettanShoutaKun> Angular.js-1.5.8
[13:46:58] <robertmaxrees> :|
[13:47:05] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't be mixing angular and jquery.
[13:47:13] <PettanShoutaKun> I don't know what else needs this... because our application is already frankengarbage.
[13:47:26] <PettanShoutaKun> so I was like... maybe I can just remove this where I know I don't need it
[13:47:39] <robertmaxrees> that's... not how that works heh.
[13:47:46] <PettanShoutaKun> You think that's bad. We have like... AngularJS jQuery and Angular(notJS)
[13:47:56] <PettanShoutaKun> and a nice smattering of cold fusion.
[13:48:00] <PettanShoutaKun> and Java.
[13:48:06] <robertmaxrees> java is fine.
[13:48:07] <PettanShoutaKun> ...................................... seriously
[13:48:19] <robertmaxrees> we use coldfusion for some legacy apps, as well.
[13:48:21] <PettanShoutaKun> Yeah I don't mind it... I do wish we'd pick on thing though.
[13:48:26] <PettanShoutaKun> *one
[13:48:32] <robertmaxrees> eh, different tools for different jobs.
[13:48:46] <PettanShoutaKun> it's crazy to actually consider and think about how many technologies are actually bundled together right here
[13:48:54] <robertmaxrees> either way, sounds like you need to actually modify your application instead of hacking in a band-aid.
[13:49:12] <PettanShoutaKun> Yeah, but modifying is expensive
[13:49:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:49:24] <PettanShoutaKun> and that requires buy in from people who aren't an SEII
[13:49:25] <robertmaxrees> you don't have a choice in this case.
[13:50:08] <robertmaxrees> also: jquery's event system isn't the same as the DOM's event system, so finding attached non-jquery handlers using jquery ism't going to work anyway.
[13:50:13] <PettanShoutaKun> if I give this function a handle... I can remove it at will right?
[13:50:19] <robertmaxrees> ^ see above
[13:50:22] <PettanShoutaKun> it's given to it in a $rootElement.on
[13:50:47] <robertmaxrees> is it attaching the handler via angular?
[13:51:04] <PettanShoutaKun> yup "$rootElement.on('click', function(event) {" line 13633
[13:51:58] <robertmaxrees> that looks like jquery to me.
[13:52:46] <PettanShoutaKun> I know have a named function attached to my stuff... can I remove that event handler with the function name?
[13:52:50] <PettanShoutaKun> *now
[13:52:58] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:53:01] <robertmaxrees> again, not that simple.
[13:53:09] <robertmaxrees> you need to have the actual object available.
[13:53:13] <robertmaxrees> not just the name
[13:53:18] <PettanShoutaKun> I need the reference that's passed back when the handler is attached don't I?
[13:53:38] <robertmaxrees> correct.  which means the function declaration must happen in a shared scope.
[13:54:03] <PettanShoutaKun> or I can be a terrible person and just shove in into some window level variable <_>
[13:54:14] <robertmaxrees> yikes
[13:54:30] <PettanShoutaKun> it's nothing that isn't done literally everywhere else sadly
[13:54:33] <robertmaxrees> i'll never understand the logic of "well the application sucks so it doesn't matter what i do".
[13:55:02] <robertmaxrees> like - that's the thinking that lead to the situation you're currenty it.
[13:55:06] <robertmaxrees> *in
[13:55:22] <PettanShoutaKun> I want to know how I have this thing... that looks like it's only attached in one place. "$rootElement.on('click', function(event) {" how does that put it on literally everything?
[13:55:40] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean "literally everything"?
[13:55:45] <PettanShoutaKun> and yeah... I know... I want to fix it later... but right now nobody will give me time to fix it correctly.
[13:55:52] <PettanShoutaKun> all anchor tags have this event on them
[13:56:03] <robertmaxrees> what is $rootElement ?
[13:56:39] <robertmaxrees> is it, like, the body or something?
[13:57:36] <PettanShoutaKun> https://hastebin.com/uqudukatek.js
[13:57:41] <PettanShoutaKun> looks like it literally might be everything
[13:57:57] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:58:01] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't answer my question.
[13:58:06] <robertmaxrees> what is "$rootElement"?
[13:58:48] <robertmaxrees> because there may be a much, much better solution to this problem.
[13:59:04] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't require tou juggling handlers.
[14:00:04] <robertmaxrees> *require you to
[14:00:10] <BustyLoli-Chan_> Yeah so as far as I can tell it's like reaching out from document and grabbing everything?
[14:00:27] <BustyLoli-Chan_> Also I missed that. I changed clients
[14:00:27] <robertmaxrees> gonna try one more time.
[14:00:32] <robertmaxrees> what is $rootElement?
[14:00:49] <robertmaxrees> your paste is unclear on what it is.
[14:02:36] <robertmaxrees> i'm asking ebcause there may be a way to do this without making things worse.
[14:05:01] <robertmaxrees> $rootElement seems to suggest that event delegation is at play here.
[14:07:25] <BustyLoli-Chan_> There's a couple comments above in the file,but I have left my desk
[14:07:47] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:08:15] <BustyLoli-Chan_> That makes me think it's somehow looking at the document and enumerating through it, but I'll try to find the file online and see if I can look at the line
[14:08:22] <BustyLoli-Chan_> PettanShoutaKun: is I
[14:08:29] <robertmaxrees> i know.
[14:08:39] <robertmaxrees> figured that out already.
[14:09:32] <robertmaxrees> and i highly doubt that the code is enumerating through the document like that.  log out $rootElement.length and see what you get back.
[14:10:23] <BustyLoli-Chan_> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angular/code.angularjs.org/master/1.5.8/angular.js
[14:10:31] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:10:35] <BustyLoli-Chan_> And will do. Ill give that a try
[14:10:40] <robertmaxrees> back way up.
[14:11:02] <BustyLoli-Chan_> You don't have to look through that file. I'm just posting it for reference. I'm thankful for your help already
[14:11:06] <robertmaxrees> you're not actually going to modify angular.
[14:11:20] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.  that's a really, really bad idea.
[14:12:25] <BustyLoli-Chan_> =X I mean my plan is to actually completely remove it later
[14:12:38] <BustyLoli-Chan_> Since we don't need in all but like three places
[14:22:03] <robertmaxrees> heh doesn't really matter.
[14:24:03] <robertmaxrees> i'd hit up #angularjs and talk to them
[14:25:27] <BustyLoli-Chan_> That's a good idea actually
[20:41:20] <Jonuz> im checking if mouse is (or is not) over certain elements with var isOutOfViewers = $(".message-viewer :hover").length === 0; and it return sometimes false when mouse is over border, even if under the border there is another element with class class
[20:42:26] <Jonuz> is it possible to detect if mouse is over border or is there other way to detect if mouse is over certain class and include border in it
