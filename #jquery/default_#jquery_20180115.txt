[01:51:18] <Cork> fas3r: you could loop over the array select the form elements by name and set there value with .val() should be as simple as that
[01:51:41] <Cork> be careful with the fact that a name can exist multiple times though
[01:52:03] <Cork> also that checkboxes and radiobuttons set checked not val()
[02:19:50] <undefined_bob> good morning
[02:33:28] <hellyeah> anyone here use jquery datatable https://jsfiddle.net/t9vkddfm/46/ when i got first warning it showed everything and second warning everything become null
[02:33:31] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/t9vkddfm/46/
[02:35:13] <hellyeah> anyway i handled it
[02:35:43] <Woet> that was quick
[02:36:48] <hellyeah> i just commented oput something
[02:40:54] <undefined_bob> does anyone worked with jquery UI accordion yet?
[02:41:40] <Woet> i'm sure people have worked with it
[02:41:44] <Woet> hope this answers your question
[02:41:56] <undefined_bob> I wondered if I can use only parts of its functionallity without changing the appearance of the already exinsting elements
[02:43:13] <undefined_bob> because I already have working accordions but would like to only use the "active" option of it
[02:43:35] <fas3r> devi8: I mean for example I do a dump of a form already fill with a $(form).serializeArray(). and I would like to restore this serializearray to the form
[02:52:52] <devi8> Cork is by far the most knowledgable person in this channel. He suggests looping through the array and filling in the values accordingly, but checkboxes and radio buttons have to be set to checked rather than a value.
[03:09:04] <hellyeah> yo can you check line 3 why i see two trash icons there please click button https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/t9vkddfm/50/
[03:10:55] <hellyeah> please some help
[03:11:14] <Woet> hellyeah: you know this is #jquery right? not #datatables
[03:11:39] <hellyeah> woet
[03:11:44] <hellyeah> this is jquery plugin
[03:11:46] <Cork> hellyeah: check your html
[03:12:14] <Woet> hellyeah: that doesn't make it a jquery question.
[03:12:24] <Woet> hellyeah: just like it doesn't make it a #chrome question just because you happen to be running it in chrome.
[03:12:29] <hellyeah> Woet,  what do you want everyday?
[03:12:53] <Woet> hellyeah: sun light and money
[03:12:58] <Woet> but not sure how it's relevant
[03:13:04] <hellyeah> you are ignored Woet
[03:13:07] <Woet> again?
[03:13:22] <hellyeah> Cork,  i have an error in html markup?
[03:13:28] <Cork> check
[03:15:45] <hellyeah> this problem is just in the delete button othjer two buttons work find
[03:15:53] <hellyeah> i just chedked several times
[03:15:54] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:15:56] <Cork> so check the html for it
[03:16:29] <Woet> Cork: hellyeah expects a lot more hand holding than this
[03:20:06] <hellyeah> Cork,  i really couldnt find where my mistake is
[03:20:18] <hellyeah> can you help?
[03:20:21] <Cork> make sure start and closing tags match
[03:20:24] <devi8> copy the html you append to the html section...you'll see it
[03:56:26] <fas3r> Hello
[05:25:06] <desnudopenguino> i'm trying to make a post call inside another post call's done block, and it seems to be partway working. it is logging the correct data to the console, but i am unable to get it to spit it out in the DOM properly. As a side note, the DOM is all a hard-coded string for the first ajax call. i can't append the result from the inner post via DOM nor via string insert
[05:25:56] <desnudopenguino> and by string insert i mean setting a variable inside the 2nd post's done block, and then calling that in the text string.
[05:29:23] <Cork> desnudopenguino: make a jsfiddle with the code (and the markup your working with)
[05:31:59] <tilerendering> can anyone tell me why my js function is not called? https://pastebin.com/w4Y9iB6g
[05:33:57] <Cork> tilerendering: cause it's html and not js?
[05:38:22] <desnudopenguino> Cork: there really isn't any markup (if you mean raw html). it's all built via javascript for the most part, in the most horrendous way i've seen. i'll dump the whole function though
[05:38:38] <Cork> desnudopenguino: so make a jsfiddle showing it
[05:39:34] <Cork> it doesn't need to be a running version just to be clear
[05:39:53] <Cork> but for "this doesn't work" seeing the actual code and the markup is normally vital to help
[05:42:15] <desnudopenguino> https://jsfiddle.net/7s3aa47q/
[05:43:01] <desnudopenguino> Cork: i understand. this thing is so shittily put together that i'd have to send you about 10k lines of code to get all of the markup.
[05:43:29] <Cork> might be worth looking at templating instead of having all that in the code
[05:43:41] <desnudopenguino> yeah, someday haha
[05:43:41] <Cork> what line number is the second ajax call?
[05:43:56] <desnudopenguino> 35 in the jsfiddle
[05:44:13] <Cork> ah there it is
[05:44:34] <desnudopenguino> i usually don't do ajax call inside ajax call, so i'm probably doing something stupid
[05:45:14] <Cork> desnudopenguino: try adding a console.log(i, $('#send_from_' + i).length) before the .text() all
[05:45:16] <Cork> *call
[05:45:35] <Cork> i suspect either i is gc:ed or the element id doesn't match anything
[05:47:09] <desnudopenguino> line 106, the code starts building a string from hell
[05:47:11] <desnudopenguino> lol
[05:47:28] <Cork> ya
[05:47:51] <Cork> that is why i recommend using a <script type="text/template" id="the-html"></script>
[05:47:56] <Cork> would make it quite a bit easier to read
[05:48:36] <Cork> then all that gounk would be var result = $($.parseHTML($('#the-html').html()))
[05:49:01] <desnudopenguino> yeah that would make sense
[05:49:18] <desnudopenguino> this project, however, doesn't make much sense in the code
[05:49:34] <Cork> never too late to start cleaning things up :)
[05:50:02] <desnudopenguino> yeah
[05:50:11] <desnudopenguino> sadly we have much bigger fish to fry
[05:50:47] <desnudopenguino> it would have probably been easier to start with a fresh framework and build it all again from scratch
[05:51:05] <Cork> ya, been there done that
[05:51:21] <Cork> (that is why i'm not giving you a world of pain about it :) )
[05:53:02] <Cork> but ya, try that console.log line and we might get a hint on what is going wrong
[05:55:06] <desnudopenguino> i can't be too hard on the prev dev though. he probably wrote/copied about 100k lines himself of php and javascript in about a year
[05:55:44] <desnudopenguino> for your log, i get '5 0' as the output in my console.
[05:56:04] <Cork> ok, so there we have the error
[05:56:25] <Cork> there are no id="send_from_5" in the document
[05:56:30] <desnudopenguino> and it is the same for each of the 4 iterations
[05:56:50] <Cork> so the result isn't inserted any where
[05:57:12] <desnudopenguino> yep
[05:57:16] <Cork> ha!
[05:57:21] <Cork> and there we have why
[05:57:26] <Cork> for(var i = 0; i < hists.length; ++i) {
[05:57:38] <Cork> for doesn't instansiate a unique variable for each loop
[05:57:54] <Cork> so all ajax calls will use the value hists.length
[05:58:15] <desnudopenguino> mhmmm
[05:58:25] * desnudopenguino is learning something new
[05:58:45] <Cork> simplest solution is to just replace it with $.each(hists, function(i) {});
[05:58:59] <Cork> as it will create an unique i for each loop
[05:59:25] <desnudopenguino> and put all the code in the for loop inside the {}'s
[05:59:25] <desnudopenguino> ?
[05:59:46] <Cork> replace for() {} with $.each(, function() {})
[05:59:55] <Cork> everything else the same
[06:00:04] <desnudopenguino> ok. let me give that a shot
[06:04:26] <desnudopenguino> magic!
[06:04:29] <desnudopenguino> that worked
[06:05:42] <desnudopenguino> Cork: thank you x10000
[06:07:16] <Cork> desnudopenguino: ya, variable scopes can be nasty
[06:08:27] <Cork> desnudopenguino: might be worth mentioning, the reason for creates problem here is cause ajax is async
[06:08:40] <Cork> so things run at a later time to the for loop has completed by then
[06:09:29] <desnudopenguino> i figured something with ajax being asynchronous was the cause
[06:10:38] <desnudopenguino> just wasn't sure where to start with it all
[06:11:22] <desnudopenguino> Cork: do you have a good resource for js markup templating, or should google suffice there?
[06:11:50] <desnudopenguino> i have yet to deal with a "single page site" interface where everything is managed by js like this one
[06:48:24] <Cork> desnudopenguino: personally i normally just use a script tag but if you need more advanced templating you mustache, underscore and jqote2
[06:48:41] <Cork> *you have*
[06:49:35] <Cork> also when ie12 dies you have es6 templates
[07:52:55] <hellyeah> hey
[07:53:04] <hellyeah> what is my mistake here please click the button https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/t9vkddfm/73/
[08:03:01] <hellyeah> why that does not work https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/t9vkddfm/76/

[08:06:33] <hellyeah> okey
[08:06:35] <hellyeah> i did it
[08:11:04] <Kartagis> hellyeah: irrelevant, but try sticking to one style. with the curly braces

[11:18:48] <z1haze> I am struggling with a form submitting even though I'm telling it prevent default, but this only happens after a second submission
[11:18:52] <z1haze> code coming.
[11:19:42] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/1PVMJMC any thoughts?
[11:22:42] <taplar> does it go in the event handler for the second submit?
[11:23:39] <z1haze> it goes through initForm, i know that much - I will check the form handler
[11:23:44] <z1haze> But i dont see how it couldnt
[11:24:34] <taplar> always verify assumptions when debugging, :)
[11:25:19] <z1haze> yes, it does.
[11:25:53] <taplar> alright so is the issue that it should be returning false and is not?
[11:26:46] <z1haze> the issue is that it should not be posting to the page
[11:26:54] <z1haze> because prevent default is right in the handler
[11:27:51] <taplar> from the code, i'm not sure why it would
[11:28:28] <z1haze> exactly
[11:33:07] <z1haze> which is why im lost :(
[11:34:14] <scetian> Hi, anyone here who can help me with google maps?
[11:34:52] <drzraf> hi
[11:35:10] <drzraf> I'm having hard time finding whether a jquery ui autocomplete menu is opened or closed
[11:35:56] <drzraf> there is a $("input").data("ui-autocomplete").menu.active  property, but it's always null.
[11:44:51] <SpecialTech> console.log('hello world');
[11:46:06] <SpecialTech> i left my job and now i feel relieved from being in that work hell. But now I've been using my time off to be a bit lazy sadly... Hows everyone's new years been? :D
[11:47:20] <SpecialTech> what are you trying to do drzraf?
[11:48:37] <drzraf> SpecialTech: I've a handler for an input field, which can be triggered independantly of jquery (blur/input/...) [it's about geocoding]
[11:48:57] <drzraf> in this handler, I'd appreciate knowing the "state" of jquery UI autocomplete menu
[11:51:40] <SpecialTech> drzraf as far as I know, you can't within the widget itself, but you can check if it's visible $('#selector').autocomplete('widget').is(':visible')
[11:56:07] <drzraf> oh, that seems pretty good!
[11:56:12] <drzraf> thank you SpecialTech
[12:30:02] <scetian> Hi, I am using google autocomplete to get the lat/long of user selected place. I send these lat/long to backend and apply geo location query on these lat/long to get all the records that lie between a radius of 100 mile of selected lat/long. The issue is that when I search for Washington I get one record, which is exactly as expected, but when I search for Americas I dont get any record, this is unexpected. Can anyone please help?
[12:52:07] <hellyeah> short question
[12:53:28] <hellyeah> when i click button i want show table but headers appear right away how can i avoid this https://jsfiddle.net/t9vkddfm/123/
[13:01:31] <taplar> don't append the table on page load
[13:03:52] <hellyeah> fixed the problem
[13:03:53] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/t9vkddfm/125/
[13:04:03] <hellyeah> table is appended when you click the table
[13:26:07] <hellyeah> hey i just want to make null "" but it ends up erasing every value on the table why is it happening https://jsfiddle.net/t9vkddfm/131/
[13:28:16] <hellyeah> any idea?
[13:31:48] <hellyeah> this is so weird
[13:33:52] <ngharo> $(element).find('.value').text("null") -- this doesn't "find" .value elements where text is null
[13:33:53] <hellyeah> it percieve everything as null values
[13:33:54] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/t9vkddfm/132/
[13:34:06] <ngharo> .text() sets the text of the element
[13:34:15] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:34:16] <ngharo> or other the jquery object i should say
[13:34:22] <ngharo> or of*
[13:34:36] <hellyeah> what is the correct function?
[13:34:48] <taplar> i would say instead of finding null values and fixing them, don't put null in there to begin with
[13:35:49] <hellyeah> that should work https://jsfiddle.net/t9vkddfm/133/
[13:37:12] <hellyeah> anyway
[13:37:54] <hellyeah> i need to take care of other things too
[13:38:01] <hellyeah> pls someone suggest something
[13:38:05] <taplar> i just did
[13:38:54] <hellyeah> i didnt put null there
[13:39:07] <taplar> then how did null show up in the table you are creating?
[13:39:08] <hellyeah> ş mean that comes from database
[13:39:14] <hellyeah> i mean*
[13:39:18] <taplar> -you-, are building the table
[13:39:33] <hellyeah> with an object
[13:39:41] <hellyeah> comes from backend
[13:39:44] <taplar> and the value of the column is either something, or null
[13:39:53] <taplar> if it's null, put an empty string instead
[13:39:55] <hellyeah> in the bandend those null values didnt appear
[13:40:08] <hellyeah> yeah thats right
[13:40:15] <hellyeah> i try to do that
[13:40:59] <hellyeah> i got null valueswith $('.td').find('.values).text() gave me null values
[13:41:09] <taplar> text is never null
[13:41:14] <taplar> that's after you created the table
[13:41:23] <hellyeah> ah
[13:41:28] <taplar> don't fix it after you create it.  don't create it like that
[13:41:33] <ngharo> yeah, check for the nulls when you're writing out the table (td.append( ... ))
[13:44:07] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:44:08] <hellyeah> so
[13:44:44] <hellyeah> instead opf trying to fix that
[13:44:53] <hellyeah> i can iterate the object
[13:44:59] <hellyeah> and replace "" instead of null
[13:46:24] <taplar> ?  why replace "" ?
[13:46:37] <ngharo> you already iterate over the object.  check if ele === null and set it to an empty string
[13:46:57] <taplar> (ele || "") shorthand
[13:46:57] <ngharo> and fix your span typos :)
[13:48:53] <hellyeah> i had span typos
[13:49:05] <hellyeah> dang
[13:56:29] <hellyeah> anyway i am really tired
[13:56:33] <hellyeah> i can work for that later
[15:03:30] <echoSMILE> after pull html content with load() or html() why the event click() don't work for the returned content?
[15:03:44] <robertmaxrees> echoSMILE are you binding the handler directly?
[15:04:04] <echoSMILE> directly how?
[15:04:07] <robertmaxrees> $('
[15:04:14] <echoSMILE> I'm using $(element).click(...
[15:04:17] <robertmaxrees> yeah./
[15:04:19] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[15:04:25] <robertmaxrees> gotta use a delegated listener instead.
[15:05:12] <echoSMILE> whats that?
[15:05:31] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[15:05:34] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[15:05:46] <robertmaxrees> basically, you can't bind to somethign that doesn't exist.
[15:05:58] <robertmaxrees> so you use a special syntax of .on() to bind to a parent thjat always exists.
[15:07:07] <echoSMILE> $(element).on('click'... ?
[15:15:23] <robertmaxrees> echoSMILE sorry abvout that.
[15:15:40] <robertmaxrees> echoSMILE if you read the docs at http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events, you'll see that it mentions that syntact is for a direct handler./
[15:15:51] <robertmaxrees> you want to look at the second example - $( "#dataTable tbody" ).on( "click", "tr", function() {
[15:16:00] <echoSMILE> robertmaxrees, yes. it worked
[15:16:02] <echoSMILE> thanks
[15:16:05] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[15:16:07] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:16:31] <echoSMILE> can I load js code from ajax as well?
[15:19:11] <taplar> yup
[15:19:31] <robertmaxrees> though I'd avoid it if possible.
[15:19:34] <robertmaxrees> assuming you mean script tags.
[15:19:36] <taplar> ^
[15:20:36] <taplar> anything that is repetitive you definitely don't want to load scripts from.  and I'd say it'd be better to load the logic on page load, and then have the ajax invoke the methods that you want when it needs them
[15:58:21] <grapheti> TOGGLE IT! - https://jsfiddle.net/9r627xg8/
[15:59:15] <taplar> why getAttribute/setAttribute?
[16:01:45] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/9r627xg8/1/
[16:02:02] <echoSMILE> robertmaxrees, the same idea happens for a form loaded by ajax, how to execute after pull the html the $("#form").serialize() ?
[16:02:35] <grapheti> damn it, I knew there was better logic
[16:03:19] <grapheti> forgot .disabled
[16:03:37] <taplar> it is an attribute, ;)
[16:03:46] <grapheti> :P
[16:03:54] <grapheti> Also, you cached the dom
[16:04:01] <grapheti> good on ya!
[16:04:10] <taplar> well, it could be done better with an IIFE
[16:04:28] <grapheti> eh, I was bored
[16:04:37] <taplar> or i wonder...
[16:05:15] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/9r627xg8/2/
[16:07:40] <grapheti> that's pretty too
[16:17:35] <echoSMILE> a form loaded from ajax, how to execute the serialize() ?
[16:18:16] <taplar> if you have a reference to the form, you can just call serialize.
[16:20:49] <echoSMILE> what do you mean a reference?
[16:21:05] <taplar> if you have a variable that points to a form, that's a reference
[16:21:23] <echoSMILE> well, the form come from ajax
[16:21:36] <echoSMILE> I can access the event submit but after I cant serialize()
[16:22:19] <taplar> do you have a fiddle of what you are trying to do?  i feel like i'm not understanding your issue
[16:23:22] <echoSMILE> suppose I have the form with id 'register', after pull it by ajax I can't do this: $("#register").serialize()
[16:23:40] <echoSMILE> that's because for certain I load it by ajax
[16:23:42] <taplar> "pull it by ajax"
[16:24:09] <taplar> you can serialize a form at any time, provided you have a reference
[16:24:40] <taplar> are you building the form dynamically?
[16:24:53] <echoSMILE> id="register" is my reference right?
[16:25:05] <taplar> that would be one way to look it up, yes
[16:26:01] <echoSMILE> taplar, I dont know what do you mean by dynamically, but if all <form></form> is loaded by ajax it can be called dynamic?
[16:26:18] <taplar> is the form being created by the ajax logic?
[16:28:05] <echoSMILE> taplar, the code that load the html for form: https://pastebin.com/FTfLY04W
[16:28:33] <taplar> so the form markup is in that 'data' variable?
[16:28:44] <echoSMILE> yes
[16:28:58] <taplar> so that means that the ajax is creating the form, so it is dynamic
[16:29:17] <taplar> alright, so your ajax creates the form.  now what is the issue?
[16:29:38] <echoSMILE> i can't serialize() that dynamic form
[16:29:52] <taplar> when/where are you trying to do that?
[16:30:27] <echoSMILE> $(document).on("submit", '#fRegistar', function(){   alert($("#fRegistar").serialize());  });
[16:30:32] <echoSMILE> on submit
[16:30:41] <taplar> i thought you said the id was 'register'
[16:30:47] <echoSMILE> it is
[16:31:05] <taplar> so you're event handler is looking for 'fRegistar'
[16:31:14] <echoSMILE> i just change things right now
[16:31:24] <taplar> the id lookup has to match
[16:31:33] <echoSMILE> but the name of id's match
[16:31:44] <echoSMILE> I just change it right now to test stuff
[16:32:12] <robertmaxrees> is #registar the ID of the button or the form?
[16:32:52] <echoSMILE> nop
[16:32:59] <robertmaxrees> ?/?
[16:33:00] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:33:04] <taplar> and is the original '#registar' a child of the '#principal'?
[16:33:14] <taplar> going off of this paste https://pastebin.com/FTfLY04W
[16:33:52] <taplar> cause if not it sounds like you are putting the same id on multiple things
[16:34:15] <echoSMILE> that #registar is the button that load the form
[16:34:22] <echoSMILE> for submit I got other
[16:34:46] <taplar> that logic is saying you click something that has the id of registar
[16:34:47] <robertmaxrees> echoSMILE submit fires from forms.
[16:34:55] <robertmaxrees> oh oh nvm,.
[16:34:57] <taplar> and then it takes the ajax response and puts that in principal
[16:34:58] <robertmaxrees> ignor eme.
[16:35:06] <taplar> which you are saying has a form with the id of 'registar' in it
[16:35:24] <taplar> i'm asking if the thing you click with the id of registar is removed when you create that form with the id of registar
[16:36:01] <echoSMILE> #registar = button to load html form and is the only element with that id
[16:36:13] <taplar> ok, so what's the identifier for the form?
[16:36:17] <echoSMILE> then I have the form with id fRegistar
[16:36:36] <taplar> ok
[16:36:54] <taplar> are you preventing the default on the submit of the fRegistar?
[16:37:12] <echoSMILE> I did, but the serialize() come in blank too
[16:37:16] <taplar> please share the logic that you are trying to do with fRegistar
[16:37:50] <echoSMILE> is that line I sent minutes ago
[16:37:56] <echoSMILE> $(document).on("submit", '#fRegistar', function(){   alert($("#fRegistar").serialize());  });
[16:38:06] <taplar> that does not have a prevent default on the event
[16:38:24] <taplar> if you don't stop the event it will submit and reload the page
[16:38:32] <echoSMILE> yes
[16:38:43] <taplar> ...
[16:39:44] <echoSMILE> I can add the e.preventDefault(); but remember the issue is the serialize() appears empty
[16:39:57] <taplar> we're debugging
[16:40:00] <echoSMILE> ok
[16:40:01] <taplar> small steps, :)
[16:40:39] <echoSMILE> ok i put the e.preventDefault();
[16:40:53] <taplar> and the page does not reload, and the alert is giving you blank still?
[16:40:54] <echoSMILE> no reload of page, but alert is empty
[16:40:58] <echoSMILE> yes
[16:41:12] <taplar> ok, my next question is are the input fields disabled?
[16:41:37] <echoSMILE> nop
[16:41:46] <taplar> do they all have name attributes?
[16:42:24] <echoSMILE> nop
[16:42:30] <echoSMILE> no name for all
[16:42:31] <taplar> then that's one issue
[16:42:38] <echoSMILE> ok let me try
[16:42:41] <taplar> serialize() expects the fields to have a name
[16:44:14] <echoSMILE> yes. i think was that
[16:44:20] <echoSMILE> let me test better
[16:45:52] <echoSMILE> taplar, yes. thank you
[16:45:56] <echoSMILE> :)

[19:23:55] <fas3r> Hello
[19:25:51] <fas3r> I prepared a plugin and I 'm not really sure how to destroy an instance. Do I just need to create a function and which call a "delete" of the instance "this" ?
[19:30:28] <robertmaxrees> what do you need to destroy?
[19:32:08] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: the data object on the element I believe.
[19:32:36] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: I call it like this : $(myElement).data('myplugin')
[19:34:47] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: basically in this destroy function I already do all the necessary like cleaning the forms, resetting validation status on each of them, remove what needs to be remove. I'm just not sure how to terminate the instance of the plugin on that particular element/form
[19:39:41] <robertmaxrees> so long as you destroy your references to it you should be fine.
[19:42:20] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: you mean like "delete $(myElement).data('myplugin')" ?
[19:42:52] <robertmaxrees> what won't do what you want heh
[19:42:54] <robertmaxrees> *that
[19:43:08] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/removeData/
[19:43:23] <robertmaxrees> though I usually suggest you don't use data elements to store data like that.
[19:45:22] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: I did not try if I can do $(myElement).myplugin('function_name') is working.
[19:46:21] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: if it's what you mean by that
[19:47:25] <robertmaxrees> so backing way up - why are you using .data() to store info?
[19:50:30] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: that's not how plugins works ? we are not suppose to call them like that ?$(element).data('plugin').functionOfPlugin() ?
[19:51:55] <robertmaxrees> not generally.
[19:52:03] <robertmaxrees> at least, that's not what most plugins do.
[19:52:10] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: I used this template https://github.com/geetarista/jquery-plugin-template/blob/master/jquery.plugin-template.js
[19:53:22] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[19:53:47] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: you pass a form to my plugin and it will generate a wizard menu with dynamic road. I know that does not justify it but if there is a better way to do I don't mind to do the appropriate changes.
[19:54:04] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: yes I started there :)
[19:55:26] <robertmaxrees> so why are you using .data()?
[19:58:12] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: well I initialise the plugin like this : $(element).nameOfPlugin( { options } ).  Then I use the data('myPlugin') to call the public function of it. Like start (if not set auto in options), goNext, goBack, manageHistory, isNextStepAddon, isNextStepRoute, etc, etc
[19:58:54] <robertmaxrees> why?
[19:59:07] <robertmaxrees> why not nameOfPlugin('someFunction') ?
[19:59:51] <fas3r> what if I have 5 forms in the same page ? I would have to pass the name of the element. Is it not better to call it directly on the appropriate element using data ?
[20:02:59] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[20:03:00] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:03:05] <robertmaxrees> you still have that.
[20:03:25] <fas3r> what do you mean ?
[20:03:38] <robertmaxrees> are you saying you're trying to store specific info for each form?
[20:03:43] <robertmaxrees> because you can get that per form.
[20:03:47] <fas3r> no no
[20:04:05] <fas3r> yes sorry
[20:04:16] <fas3r> each form have is own mechanism.
[20:04:44] <robertmaxrees> you realize your 'this' inside the plugin is a jquery collection, yeah?
[20:06:36] <robertmaxrees> you can create a prototype object to store than info and instantiate that for each instance of the plugin.
[20:07:38] <robertmaxrees> if you want to avoid that route, then knock yourself out with .data()
[20:07:45] <robertmaxrees> but only do that from within the plugin.
[20:10:28] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: ok I think I understand what you mean, so I would probably only have to update this part at the end : https://pastebin.com/eC9CFv2D
[20:11:03] <fas3r> because all my function are in a Plugin.prototype
[20:11:36] <robertmaxrees> so you DO have a prototype?
[20:11:42] <fas3r> I do.
[20:11:50] <robertmaxrees> and you're instatiating that on each element?
[20:14:03] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: here the squelette : https://pastebin.com/WEizMtqQ
[20:14:27] <fas3r> I removed all the functions but you will see the main structure of it.
[20:15:28] <robertmaxrees> right.  so now you just need a way to reference back to that instance, right?
[20:16:05] <fas3r> yes
[20:16:13] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways to do that :)
[20:17:04] <fas3r> do you think you could explain me or point me where I should look ?
[20:17:11] <fas3r> please :)
[20:18:38] <fas3r> I thought that data('') was normal when you want to instanciate your plugin X time on different element.
[20:28:23] <robertmaxrees> sorry.
[20:28:36] <robertmaxrees> there are a few different ways.  some folks do .data()
[20:28:50] <robertmaxrees> I like making an array within that wrapping IIFE and storew data in there.
[20:29:38] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: do you think you could show me a example to better understand ?
[20:29:55] <fas3r> not necesseraly now :).
[20:30:18] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[20:30:25] <robertmaxrees> what part of that is confusing?
[20:31:07] <fas3r> I just don't picture it.
[20:38:43] <robertmaxrees> sec
[20:59:20] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: sure no problem
[21:32:02] <hellyeah> yo yo yo
