[00:57:34] <wathek> hi everybody
[00:59:36] <wathek> do you know if there is alreay any plugin that creates a swipable slider that shows 3 images the main image appears in the middle and with bigger size and the previous image appears on the left a little bit smaller and with a little transparency and same for the next image except that it appears on the right
[01:05:45] <bigbugjava> Moataz-E show up your code: jsfiddle please
[01:05:54] <bigbugjava> I have similer problems, maybe I can help
[01:05:58] <bigbugjava> had
[01:06:26] <Moataz-E> bigbugjava: http://www.moatazelmasry.com/projects/softdev/project-euler
[01:06:41] <Moataz-E> bigbugjava: choose the first problem from the dropdown menu
[01:07:04] <Moataz-E> bigbugjava: thanks a lot for offering to help!
[01:51:01] <bigbugjava> Moataz-E sec
[01:51:46] <bigbugjava> Moataz-E went trough the site, didn't saw issues
[01:55:59] <zro> im trying to "intercept" the form submit event, and show a dialog, then if user clicks ok, continue submitting the form. but every way i write the code, i have to click submit 2x... what am i doing wrong here?  http://sprunge.us/SbRD?js
[01:58:57] <bigbugjava> How to populate Image sliders dynamicly? I get the object with links only onload, so I need a way to add the links dynamicly, the thing is everything I see is preset I need to be totally dynamic, and I dont even know how many pictures will be in it,thx ahead
[02:04:36] <Woet> ?demo @ zro
[02:04:36] <b-ot> zro: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:06:20] <Woet> zro: if you were to actually do that which I've done for you: http://jsfiddle.net/NcQ96/
[02:06:32] <Woet> you'd see the code works fine and clicking submit once works
[02:06:42] <Woet> so the code you pasted is not the problem.
[02:09:46] <bigbugjava> Woet you know how to populate html links dynamicly? from an object?
[02:22:29] <fabioportieri> bigbugjava: use a slider tha does things dinamically or destroy and reinit your slider at every update
[02:23:15] <bigbugjava> fabioportieri it does things dynamicly
[02:23:39] <fabioportieri> bigbugjava: check the slider api for adding items..
[02:23:42] <bigbugjava> but cant I append to a div, <img src> foreach  object
[02:23:54] <fabioportieri> what?
[02:24:28] <bigbugjava> lets say <div id='slider>with some sources</div>
[02:24:35] <fabioportieri> yes
[02:24:50] <Moataz-E> bigbugjava: dont worry, thanks for the effort though! appreciated
[02:25:11] <bigbugjava> I delete thoese sources because I need it dynamicly, and on javascript, when I get the object from server with links, append them to that div ?
[02:26:06] <bigbugjava> fabioportieri make sence?
[02:26:33] <fabioportieri> bigbugjava: yes i don't know what part of it you can't do it
[02:27:55] <fabioportieri> $.ajax(...,function(data) { ... //get the links; $("#slider").append("<img src='..."); } or something
[02:28:24] <bigbugjava> fabioportieri I was thinking while talking to you, understanding what to do :)
[02:29:13] <fabioportieri> yes make sense you'll do an ajax call and update the stuff, you'll probably need to reinit the slider, check its api for the proper way to do it
[02:29:33] <bigbugjava> yeah will do
[02:29:45] <bigbugjava> thx, will update
[02:30:19] <fabioportieri> no prob
[02:37:57] <bigbugjava> fabioportieri http://jsfiddle.net/q6KRt/ if you can have a look
[02:38:07] <bigbugjava> getting 0 on conosle.log (key) dunno why
[02:43:33] <Woet> bigbugjava: can you please create a working demo?
[02:43:47] <Woet> start with selecting jQuery on the left
[02:43:54] <Woet> define the missing variables (e.g. sitename)
[02:44:11] <Woet> use the jsfiddle way of doing ajax requests or take ajax out of the code
[02:44:45] <bigbugjava> sec
[02:45:03] <bigbugjava> Woet I dont think it can work because object comes from server
[02:45:51] <Woet> then take ajax out of the equation if it's not related to the problem
[02:48:04] <zro> it appears that my form submitting modal works if the submit button is input[type=submit], but not button[type=submit]? does that make sense? I guess I'm not understanding why that would be. http://jsfiddle.net/Xa85b/ vs http://jsfiddle.net/Xa85b/1/
[02:48:22] <bigbugjava> Woet http://jsfiddle.net/q6KRt/1/
[02:48:43] <Woet> bigbugjava: Uncaught ReferenceError: PhotosHolder is not defined
[02:51:01] <bigbugjava> it's more of gist work to make it work
[02:51:38] <bigbugjava> I want think you can figure out the syntex prob, because I do get the correct link, just need to add them right to slider, will try to figure ;)
[03:03:26] <dekiss> how can I load main.js and custom.js with require.js?
[03:10:19] <oddalot> require('./main.js'); ?
[03:28:59] <bigbugjava> Resource interpreted as Image but transferred with MIME type application/octet-stream: , it's not an error, but I do get that message, getting photos from web to image slider, whats the issue?
[03:54:43] <meshkov_> hello. have a question: what time is it now in Cupertino?
[03:55:17] <oddalot> 3:54 a,

[03:58:39] <Woet> such relevance
[04:25:16] <dekiss> how can I type value for animate that is existing value plus some other value
[04:25:25] <dekiss> like left: +=300
[04:25:28] <dekiss> but this wont do :S

[05:07:46] <DevAntoine> hi
[05:09:24] <DevAntoine> I catch the click on a given link, then do "event.preventDefault()" to stop the link to load. After that I manually do myLink.trigger('click') to trigger the click again and be sure it doesn't enter in the same click event again, but even if the trigger works the link isn't loaded
[05:19:59] <moritz> Hi all. I'd like to dynamically change the feed URL of a page, so that if somebody subscribes to the feed from within firefox, they'll get the new feed URL
[05:20:05] <moritz> how can I do that?
[05:22:22] <DevAntoine> so, I have this (this won't work because of the ajax call): http://jsfiddle.net/885QY/ when it enters the condition everything works fine, the link is triggered and the confirm dialog appears, but pressing ok doesn't make the link loads, nothing happens. I'm pretty sure it's because of the event.preventDefault() but I don't know what to do
[06:10:32] <aolko> hi there, me again, where's Velveeta?
[06:15:13] <aolko> alrighty then, who can help me w/ merging? http://pastie.org/8577050 + http://pastie.org/8577051#1,4,11,17
[06:15:20] <aolko> i tired, it didn't work
[06:20:44] <moritz> try again when you're not tired :-)
[06:22:04] <aolko> maybe you'll help?
[06:23:15] <jomofcw> Hello ! I'm trying to create a new DOm element doing $('<a></a>',{class:'cssButton'}); but it doesn't add the class "cssButton" to the A element :/... why ?
[06:25:19] <moritz> jomofcw: works here
[06:25:31] <jomofcw> moritz hello
[06:25:41] <jomofcw> Hm :/... So what could be wrong :/
[06:25:44] <aolko> moritz please..?
[06:26:45] <moritz> jomofcw: have you tried to run that small piece in isolation?
[06:27:04] <moritz> jomofcw: if not, there could be something wrong with the code around it (ie it's not getting called, but you think it was)
[06:27:12] <jomofcw> OK, I just let a content in the A element, I should create it empty... can I add the content using the properties object ?
[06:27:49] <jomofcw> OK I can ^^ just use the html propertie =). Thanks for your help ^^.
[06:27:50] <moritz> jomofcw: you can add contents by calling .html('new content here')
[06:28:06] <jomofcw> and can be done using {html:'content'} too
[06:28:36] <moritz> why don't you just try it, and see if it works?
[06:28:53] <moritz> just open the console in firebug or chrome dev tools, and try it out
[06:29:04] <moritz> one line to type, then you know it
[06:29:09] <moritz> it's even faster than asking if it works
[06:31:09] <jomofcw> Yup sure ;).
[06:40:29] <hcumberdale> hi there, http://jsfiddle.net/69akn/38/ combobox does not work :(
[06:42:00] <aolko> Moritz
[06:56:00] <k0bi> any one know how to post with XDomainRequest data
[07:16:27] <jinvan> ?
[07:19:51] <jomofcw> Is there a way to get the type of the data an AJAX request return ?
[07:47:52] <jax> hello
[07:48:01] <jax> what's the correct way to a preventDefault on an <a> ?
[07:48:12] <jax> for some reason it is still calling the url defined in href
[07:48:34] <jax> $('a[data-type=copy-link]').click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); return false; }(;
[07:48:39] <jax> eh });
[07:54:27] <BillCriswell> jax: I'm guessing your selector just isn't right?
[07:54:34] <BillCriswell> e.preventDefault() should be enough.
[07:55:56] <aolko> Hey, Velveeta, i've got a bit of an issue
[07:56:35] <Velveeta> i can try to help, but i just woke up :)
[07:57:15] <aolko> the issue is: can't merge
[07:57:33] <Velveeta> can't merge what?
[07:57:41] <aolko> our scripts
[07:57:47] <aolko> your inside mine
[07:57:50] <aolko> well i tried, but got no output
[07:58:41] <Velveeta> i'm not sure which scripts you're talking about, last night was a long time and a lot of alcohol ago
[07:59:45] <aolko> http://pastie.org/8577050 http://pastie.org/8577050
[07:59:53] <aolko> whoops
[07:59:55] <aolko> http://pastie.org/8577051
[08:00:08] <aolko> mine's first
[08:03:34] <Velveeta> so, you'd define list somewhere outside of document.ready, and initialize it inside document.ready
[08:03:50] <Velveeta> the processXM function could go outside document.ready also
[08:04:16] <Velveeta> as well as the setInterval function block
[08:05:06] <Velveeta> the guts of your ajax success function would be replaced with a call to processXML, you can just pass it by name as your success option, e.g. success: processXML
[08:05:47] <aolko> well, the thing is, my script has ajax for xml
[08:05:54] <aolko> so it quite differs
[08:06:24] <Velveeta> well, it doesn't *quite* differ, that's only a slight modification
[08:06:42] <Velveeta> that's why i said put the processXML call as your ajax success callback
[08:07:08] <aolko> can you stich 'em together, please? I'm kind of brb
[08:07:09] <Velveeta> how you want to handle stale data is gonna determine how we finish setting up the setInterval block
[08:07:19] <Velveeta> you're kind of brb?
[08:07:27] <aolko> yes
[08:07:36] <Velveeta> i'm telling you how to stitch them together, but i'm not going to do your work for you :)
[08:07:41] <Velveeta> like i said, i just woke up
[08:08:15] <aolko> tough Christmas, i assume
[08:08:44] <Velveeta> not at all, just a lot of drink
[08:20:33] <BillCriswell> Fucking flex is like learning floats all over again.
[08:21:05] <Velveeta> heheheheh
[08:25:44] <jomofcw> Just to be sure : this $(function(){console.log('test');}), will output "test" uin the console each time a DOM is loaded (initial load and then others AJAX load) ?
[08:31:00] <BillCriswell> jomofcw: No. You would have to use a success callback or .done() or something for the AJAX stuff.
[08:40:23] <aolko> fail
[08:40:47] <aolko> if i put $(function () { list = $('#list'); before document.ready
[08:40:55] <aolko> it rages on (xml)
[08:41:04] <aolko> 'cos it's not declared yet
[08:42:11] <BillCriswell> What?
[08:43:54] <aolko> Velveeta will get it
[08:57:44] <Velveeta> i'm about to be playing skylanders with the kiddo, aolko, remove the xml declaration, and just move the list initialization inside of your existing document.ready, no need to have 2 document.ready's side by side
[08:57:55] <Velveeta> and on that note, i'm unavailable for a while now
[08:58:02] <aolko> ok
[09:11:53] <petey> is there anyway to test for a certain 'this'
[09:11:55] <petey> I can't ifgure out why mega menu isn't working and it's probably because it's not picking up on the correct this
[09:17:24] <jphase> petey: just console.log it and you should be able to see if it's the correct/incorrect element
[09:20:30] <petey> ah that is awesome, thanks!
[09:24:16] <brettfrable> anyone in here familiar with ember?
[09:32:22] <aolko> Velveeta, nope, did as you said, didn't work http://pastie.org/8577626
[09:36:59] <petey> Any idea why .slideDown() would not reveal something that's hidden?
[09:37:12] <petey> I came up with a quick demo http://jsbin.com/EpIjeqAR/1/edit and it works when I have display:none set in my css
[09:37:18] <petey> but in my real code, .slideDown() does not do anyhting
[09:38:35] <petey> nvm...
[09:53:10] <zulcc> i have a button().css( { 'height' : '300px' } ) next to a <textarea style="height: 300px;"></textarea>, it's not vertically centered. maybe someone knows the needed css property off the top of their head?
[09:55:47] <petey_> would it be faster to cache a selector and do something like $megamenu.find(current)?
[09:55:54] <petey_> I have 4 items in a mega menu
[10:00:33] <BillCriswell> zulcc: If they're still inline you can use vertical-align: middle.
[10:05:46] <zulcc> BillCriswell: <3
[10:07:19] <scar> when creating a site in all ajax, i imagine i'm going to need to hijack the next/prev buttons of the browser correct? if so, what's the best method ensuring proper prev/next ?
[10:08:22] <zulcc> scar: jquery.address plugin
[10:08:58] <scar> zulcc, well, if its an all ajax site, there isnt really any history
[10:09:14] <scar> i want to possibly store my own history within a global var, perhaps an array
[10:09:42] <zulcc> you need +1 history for any ajax move the user does on the site, the address plugin artificially creates those
[10:10:28] <zulcc> so that when the user hits the back button, he is not sent entirely off your site to the one he was previously on, but one step back inside of your ajax site
[10:17:58] <scar> zulcc, hm... but wont i need to code what each back/forward does? i imagine i basically need to, assuming this address plugin does what i think, i just need to store variables and data that interact with my ajax app so it knows what to do?
[10:22:08] <zulcc> $('#products').on({ click: function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $('#content').load('products.php', function() { $.address.value("/products"); }); }); for example
[10:22:53] <zulcc> upon your ajax-loading of the page, you change the address bar to the new address and it will be added to the browser history
[10:23:28] <zulcc> on the other hand you will need to make sure, that the URL /products really does work if someone visits that separately (no ajax history)
[10:23:37] <zulcc> apache mod_rewrite for example
[10:27:37] <scar> hmm
[10:29:52] <zulcc> if you use a front controller as many would suggest, like accessing all your pages a la index.php?view=products, then $.address.value("/index.php?view=products") hits it all. separate visitors will have a working link while you indeed add a step in the browser history
[10:30:46] <zulcc> no need for the rewrite engine then. it just makes everything a notch more elegant. i prefer mydomain.com/products above anything else
[10:30:50] <scar> i wonder if it would work with a wordpress site easily since everything runs via index.php
[10:31:27] <zulcc> front controller
[10:31:46] <scar> well i guess wp is a front controller then
[10:32:30] <scar> im thinking this would work
[10:34:19] <scar> zulcc, i imagine i can prevent default within the $.address() plugin?
[10:34:40] <scar> so, if any link is clicked, prevent from going to that link via page reload if it's flagged, say with a class or data attribute
[10:35:49] <zulcc> the preventDefault(); is bound to the on 'click' of the jQuery-selector selected element on page, it's unrelated to the address plugin
[10:37:16] <scar> $.address.change(function(e)) { if(something) { e.preventDefault(); }
[10:37:17] <scar> ??
[10:37:23] <scar> something like that
[10:37:26] <braddunbar> Anyone know why 2.1.0-beta3 is published on npm but 1.11.0-beta3 isn't?
[10:38:34] <zulcc> the preventDefault removes the standard HTML-action of actually loading another page when a link-element is clicked, instead, you are performing your jquery.load()
[10:39:02] <zulcc> but if someone manually $.address.change()es, why would you prevent any default action?
[10:39:34] <scar> ahh i see. so basically i need to bind to the A(anchor) click actions then right?
[10:41:28] <zulcc> scar: when you use jQuery load, you are not limited to <a> for clicking/loading actions. you can assign the load() action to any page element you can select by for example <div id="foo"> $('#foo').on('click... or class <div class="bar"> $('.bar').on...
[10:42:02] <scar> true, but id rather not have to create more Js for each action, rather just send action data with the click and let the server send back the output
[10:42:09] <scar> bad idea?
[10:42:11] <mvpgraff> So, I'm validating a form using the jquery validation, but I also have PHP Validation on the same form. I only see one of those validations go off (jquery). How can I make jquery validate first, then the PHP validate that the info is correct/trim, remove queries, etc...?
[10:42:44] <mvpgraff> I've never done both validations at once so, I got stuck here.
[10:43:11] <mvpgraff> And trying to search has led me only to "jquery validations on top of a php form"
[10:43:12] <mvpgraff> lol
[10:43:38] <zulcc> scar: an elegant way to handle $_POST-data from <form>'s is the jQuery Form plugin, you end up not loading the reciver page, just sending data to it
[10:44:30] <zulcc> if that's what you meant by action data
[10:46:33] <zulcc> mvpgraff: out of the blue i'd say, the jQuery validation is live, while the PHP validation is on the recieving end of your post-data
[10:48:07] <mvpgraff> yea, the issue with that from what I learned is we still receive a bunch of errors that the user never knew to fix making it null. I wanted to see if there was a way of doing jquery & php validation live vs having to do jquery live, and php validation on receiving end.
[10:48:10] <zulcc> jQuery is client-sided javascript, so its manipulatable. you cannot ensure that the POSTed data is valid with client-sided JavaScript. You can give the users directions as to how many chars they can use for what, output an error if the mail address doesn't contain @'s etc. but ultimatively you need to validate the POST-data with the PHP recieving end
[10:49:44] <mvpgraff> meh, I'll jsut do that. It just sucks when some user ends up filling out the form and made a mistake that cause jquery to accept and then the php just nulls the form and we never receive it. Dead consumer instantly rather than giving them the chance to fix it.
[10:51:09] <mvpgraff> idk how, but when I review the data at times from the database, there's times where the user is missing a number in the phone number fields and I know on my end the jquery is working, but idk what the user did to make them fill 8 numbers instead of 9 lol...
[10:51:28] <zulcc> oh you're talking about a contact form that sends a mail or something... i was thinking more in the database direction. well interactively you should use javascript, with the same validity-critria as the PHP checks after that i would say
[10:52:28] <zulcc> so that you wont end up having cases where one goes through and the other one fails
[10:52:56] <mvpgraff> yea probably do that
[10:53:17] <zulcc> if someone starts to use < > ?> and so on in a normal contact form, you can be pretty sure that he doesn't intend to buy your product ;p
[10:53:33] <mvpgraff> if all else fails just do the jquery first, php after and just redirect them back to the page with the php error on top of the form.
[10:53:59] <mvpgraff> yea sanitize so good
[10:54:02] <mvpgraff> lmao
[11:00:15] <Velveeta> if you were running nodejs, you could have a javascript validation module that was shared between the back and front end, so you only need to write your logic once, and have the same validation rules apply to the client and server without having to maintain them in separate places ;)
[11:05:57] <mvpgraff> yup
[11:06:10] <mvpgraff> but its harder getting approved to run node.js :D
[11:07:03] <aolko> So,Velveeta
[11:07:12] <aolko> http://pastie.org/8577626
[11:07:31] <aolko> did as you said
[11:07:55] <Velveeta> mvpgraff: yep ;) works quite well as a middle-tier also though, that might be a way to get a food in the door with it ;)
[11:08:27] <mvpgraff> ;p
[11:08:29] <Velveeta> aolko: that's not what i'd said to do, i said put the processXML function outside of document.ready, and pass its name to your success callback like success: processXML
[11:10:54] <mvpgraff> well, looks like more development time is needed :l good thing it's christmas. S o  s l o w.
[11:11:54] <aolko> so, console says: http://prntscr.com/2e4s39
[11:12:52] <Velveeta> aolko: so now you need to make your $.ajax call into a separate function, and call *it* as part of document.ready
[11:20:06] <aolko> still the same
[11:20:51] <Velveeta> show me an updated paste
[11:21:12] <aolko> http://pastie.org/8577982
[11:21:56] <Velveeta> you have 2 document.ready functions nested inside of a document.ready function
[11:22:40] <Velveeta> your function ajaxRequest is being attached as a document.ready callback, the name is scrapped
[11:23:02] <Velveeta> and you're also not calling it from anywhere
[11:24:17] <aolko> calls are marked as unresolved
[11:24:54] <Velveeta> what does that mean
[11:25:08] <aolko> http://prntscr.com/2e4wf2
[11:26:17] <aolko> but it seems right http://prntscr.com/2e4wrx
[11:27:38] <Velveeta> aolko: i told you that function wasn't being done properly, the name is going to be scrapped because you're passing it as a function expression
[11:28:04] <aolko> so should i remove this document.ready then?
[11:28:05] <Velveeta> you have 2 document.ready function calls nested inside of a document.ready
[11:28:23] <Velveeta> you need to move those functions out of document.ready that i told you about hours ago
[11:28:57] <Velveeta> document.ready should be a 2-line function… initializing your list variable, and calling your ajaxRequest function
[11:29:03] <aolko> i can only see this document.ready http://prntscr.com/2e4xpu
[11:29:05] <Velveeta> everything else should be outside of document.ready
[11:29:11] <dekiss> this 'background-position-x': "-=1000"+'%' is ok in animate ?
[11:29:32] <Velveeta> aolko: this format of calling a function: $(function … *is* a document.ready function also
[11:29:36] <Velveeta> it's shorthand
[11:30:02] <Velveeta> dekiss: why are you concatenating a percent sign onto it?
[11:32:18] <aolko> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'empty'
[11:32:31] <BillCriswell> :)
[11:33:07] <aolko> http://prntscr.com/2e4z1y
[11:33:47] <petey> is there anyway to reference variables across multiple javascript files?
[11:34:13] <petey> I've got a listing = $('.listing') anything I can do reference it in a different file ?
[11:35:47] <Velveeta> aolko: show-me-an-updated-paste, always show me an updated paste
[11:36:08] <Velveeta> petey: you could store its reference in the global (window) namespace
[11:36:16] <aolko> http://pastie.org/8578022
[11:37:41] <petey> Hm okay cool velveeta I'll do some research, thanks!
[11:37:57] <petey> can I pass in a variable from another function
[11:38:04] <Velveeta> aolko: all of this crap is still inside document.ready… i'm almost ready to throw up my hands… you need to declare a list variable outside of document.ready, and initialize it inside of document.ready, that line and a call to your ajaxRequest function should be the only things inside of document.ready
[11:38:30] <Velveeta> petey: yes you can, that's called dependency injection, and is a good technique if you can structure your code to use it
[11:39:06] <Velveeta> petey: one way would be to do something like this at the top of each file: var listing = listing || $('.listing');
[11:39:35] <petey> i've always wondered what that was called!
[11:39:35] <Velveeta> er rather window.listing = window.listing || $('.listing');
[11:39:48] <Velveeta> that would only parse the dom for it once, and every other time it's encountered, would use the existing one in the window object
[11:40:13] <petey> hm i see
[11:40:24] <Velveeta> petey: yes, dependency inject relies on the developer passing around references to things to be used in other functions or modules… backbone is built on that, node is built on that, angularjs is built on that, etc
[11:40:28] <petey> I don't get the first part, window.listing
[11:40:45] <Velveeta> it also allows for runtime swapping of dependencies through configuration files
[11:40:47] <petey> so if $('.listing') isn't declared, what's window.listing do? nothing
[11:41:01] <Velveeta> window.listing = window.listing || $('.listing');
[11:41:08] <Velveeta> if window.listing is already declared, it will use it
[11:41:13] <Velveeta> otherwise it will use $('.listing')
[11:41:34] <petey> oh okay
[11:41:34] <Velveeta> so it'll parse the dom for it once, and then use that from that point on
[11:41:43] <petey> so if I set a variable of listing for example,
[11:41:49] <petey> I was confused by the actual window.listing
[11:42:00] <petey> it could be listing || $('.listing'); right?
[11:42:03] <Velveeta> yeah, that way it lives in the global namespace to be accessed by other files
[11:42:10] <petey> or does it need window.listing?
[11:42:13] <dekiss> myPos = $("#aaa").attr("background-position").split(" ");
[11:42:21] <dekiss> when I do this i get Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'split' of undefined
[11:42:23] <dekiss> why?
[11:42:57] <BillCriswell> dekiss: There's no background-position attribute.
[11:43:01] <Velveeta> will if you do var listing = listing || $('.listing'); then you'll make a local variable instance, if you stick it in the window object, it makes it global
[11:43:08] <BillCriswell> You probably want .css('background-position').split(' ')
[11:43:20] <Velveeta> ^^^ that
[11:44:00] <petey> ohhh
[11:44:02] <petey> ok
[11:44:26] <petey> that makes sense! thanks velveeta - you have just opened a new door in the js world! woo
[11:44:36] <Velveeta> :)
[11:44:47] <BillCriswell> No more blue box blues for you.
[11:44:59] <BillCriswell> No wait that's kraft.
[11:45:10] <Velveeta> petey, you could also just say "listing = listing || $('.listing');" and without the var keyword, it's the same as saying window.listing, it creates a global var
[11:45:33] <dekiss> Velveeta but except percent sign is this ok?
[11:45:39] <petey> oh okay
[11:45:45] <petey> but var window.listing creates a global variable
[11:45:57] <petey> so are they functionally the same? var window.listing vs just declaring listing = ?
[11:46:05] <dekiss> BillCriswell there is it has backgroud position
[11:46:06] <Velveeta> dekiss: you can do a -= operation, yes, but i don't know if it works with percentages or not
[11:46:11] <dekiss> ahh
[11:46:15] <dekiss> Velveeta no I mean
[11:46:18] <Velveeta> petey: they are functionally equivalent
[11:46:20] <dekiss> background-position-x?
[11:46:26] <dekiss> it shouldn't be backgroundPositionX?
[11:46:37] <Velveeta> a variable declaration without the var keyword creates a global variable reference, as does storing it in the window object
[11:47:14] <petey> that makes sense, thank you - i may be back in a few minutes with another question, lol
[11:47:38] <petey> wait, so if i have a global variable, and it changes inside of a function, does that value change or is it only in that function?
[11:48:22] <Velveeta> the global value changes
[11:48:26] <Siecje> I'm trying to set the value of an input to a javascript list. https://dpaste.de/Yh5w
[11:48:28] <Velveeta> it's a shared variable reference
[11:49:41] <Velveeta> siecje: you can't set a form element's value to an array, if i'm correct, you might get the .toString() value stored in that element
[11:49:54] <aolko> oh great, now it's throwing unexpected tokens http://pastie.org/8578055
[11:49:55] <petey> That makes life awesome, thanks velveeta
[11:49:57] <Velveeta> form array values are done with multiple form elements sharing a name
[11:50:10] <BillCriswell> I also don't think you can use post that way Siecje.
[11:50:47] <BillCriswell> It would need to be a serialized string or an array of ojects with name and value properties...
[11:51:30] <Velveeta> aolko: you're getting closer now, you still need to declare a list variable outside of document.ready, and you need to initialize it inside of document.ready by moving line 58 of that paste out of function listGen and into document.ready
[11:52:18] <BillCriswell> Siecje: What is the other side looking for? skill_order_ids=1,2 or skill_order_ids[0]=1&skill_order_ids[1]=2 ?
[11:53:16] <Siecje> BillCriswell: I havn't got that far, I can't seem to send the list
[11:53:44] <Velveeta> i would think if you're expecting to send an array of data, you'd want to receive it as an array also
[11:53:53] <Velveeta> which would be the 2nd form bill listed
[11:54:11] <Siecje> ok
[11:54:22] <BillCriswell> Siecje: Err...
[11:54:53] <BillCriswell> Siecje: What if you do skill_order_ids.join(','), do you see it then?
[11:55:29] <BillCriswell> I mispoke what I said about the two ways it expects the data, I was thinking of how jQuery serializes it, not how it'll take it.
[11:55:53] <Siecje> "1,2"
[11:56:37] <BillCriswell> Yeah but is it posting how you expect it to?
[11:57:02] <Siecje> no I get [''] as post data
[11:57:14] <aolko> so what about unexpected token? It still happens. Same pastie
[11:57:22] <aolko> line 92
[11:57:59] <Velveeta> this line? jQuery('#list').html('<ul...
[11:58:58] <aolko> no,         })
[11:59:03] <dekiss> I can't understand this :S
[11:59:20] <dekiss> is this ok ? background-position-x: "100px" ?
[11:59:32] <dekiss> it shouldn't be backgroundPositionX: "100px" ?
[11:59:44] <Siecje> Here is my situation http://jsfiddle.net/rh6fD/15/
[11:59:50] <BillCriswell> Siecje: So $.post('/profile', { 'skill_order_ids': skill_order_ids.join(', ') }); doesn't post any form data? Assuming php var_dump($_POST); returns nothing?
[12:01:04] <dekiss> I have one container, I move its background image x position for 260px to the left also I have 3 divs in the ontainer and I am movine the divs left position -260pxm they both move for different amount
[12:01:06] <dekiss> how is this possible
[12:02:23] <Velveeta> aolko: there's an extra closing brace on like 37 of that paste
[12:02:40] <Siecje> BillCriswell: I am not using that since I would need to send csrf_token and that is a whole new can of worms
[12:03:00] <Siecje> BillCriswell: I'm trying to set a form field and submit the form and the form already has a csrf_token
[12:03:30] <dekiss> is this ok ? background-position-x: "100px" ?
[12:03:34] <dekiss> it shouldn't be backgroundPositionX: "100px" ?
[12:04:01] <Velveeta> it should be the 2nd one
[12:04:06] <aolko> so,now, i moved list = $('#list'); bit to document.ready
[12:04:09] <Velveeta> unless you enclose the key in quotes
[12:04:16] <Velveeta> aolko: ok, show me an updated paste
[12:04:45] <aolko> http://pastie.org/8578097
[12:04:55] <dekiss> I have one container, I move its background image x position for 260px to the left also I have 3 divs in the ontainer and I am movine the divs left position -260pxm they both move for different amount
[12:05:05] <aolko> i might did it wrong
[12:05:12] <dekiss> how is this possible
[12:05:15] <dekiss> it was ok before :(
[12:06:11] <Velveeta> aolko: you still need to declare list outside of document.ready, just put "var list;" somewhere outside of it
[12:07:15] <Velveeta> you can also get rid of the declaration of currentTime and currentDate outside of document.ready, those are declared inside of their own functions
[12:09:03] <aolko> did it http://pastie.org/8578106
[12:09:51] <petey> hey velveeta what about if you have a function and then you do like a click.(function()) does that outer variable work?
[12:10:18] <dekiss> 'background-position-x': "+=260" I am not sure why but this is working in animate
[12:10:21] <Velveeta> petey: not sure what you mean by that, whip me up some sample code on a site like pastebin or jsfiddle
[12:10:25] <petey> ok one sec
[12:11:31] <aolko> oh, not again :( (same pastie) http://prntscr.com/2e5buf
[12:12:31] <Velveeta> aolko: right, so now we have some questions to be answered
[12:12:37] <Velveeta> dealing with stale data
[12:12:51] <petey> http://jsbin.com/ODaXOQIK/1/edit
[12:12:58] <petey> let me know if that makes sense
[12:14:06] <zulcc> i have a ui-button, the padding is always so huge. im trying button().css( { 'padding-right' : '0', 'padding-left' : '0' } ); to reduce it, im targetting the correct DOM element, other porperties are applied. But i can't get rid of the huge space to the left/right of the button text
[12:14:08] <Velveeta> petey: yes, that makes sense
[12:14:18] <petey> does that outer height work on the inner function?
[12:14:20] <Velveeta> so you just want to know if height, declared outside of that click function, is available within it?
[12:14:23] <petey> im assuming it does, but not the other way around
[12:14:24] <petey> yes
[12:14:26] <petey> exactly
[12:14:33] <Velveeta> yepyep, that term is called closure scope
[12:14:50] <aolko> Velveeta, uh?
[12:15:07] <petey> cool, thanks again velveeta!
[12:15:09] <zulcc> if i understood correctly, button() is only creating one DOM element. no extra ones for the label that could cause an extra margin...
[12:15:11] <petey> im gonna be a pro soon!
[12:15:18] <Velveeta> aolko: so the other day, you had mentioned that when the time rolled over to midnight, you wanted to wipe the previous day's tasks, and present the new current day, right?
[12:15:51] <aolko> yes
[12:16:04] <Velveeta> watching a post-christmas-deep-space-9 marathon today, and one of the greatest episodes just started :D
[12:16:44] <Velveeta> aolko: at that time, is it going to be relying on the previously-loaded xml? or is it gonna issue a new ajax request for a fresh set of xml?
[12:17:25] <aolko> well, previously-loaded, i'm trying to get only 1 xml file
[12:17:51] <Velveeta> so if the user doesn't refresh their page for say, 2 weeks, they could still conceivably be running off of that same xml data right?
[12:18:50] <aolko> yes
[12:19:21] <Velveeta> aolko: ok, so what we're gonna way to do is copy the response xml to some higher scope level so it can hang around and be accessed by other functions on an ongoing basis
[12:19:41] <Velveeta> i'll take what you have currently, and show you what i mean, and make a couple of other tweaks at the same time
[12:19:49] <aolko> ok
[12:20:54] <zulcc> nevermind my question, overlooked the obvious
[12:28:27] <speaker123> hey having some trouble parsing json:   $.parseJSON("[1, NaN]")
[12:28:40] <speaker123> fails....how do i parse arrays which contain NaNs?
[12:31:33] <BillCriswell> What are you expecting the result to be speaker123?
[12:32:39] <speaker123> [1, NaN]
[12:32:45] <speaker123> just like eval("[1, NaN]")
[12:33:19] <speaker123> looks like this isn't jquery specific...
[12:34:01] <speaker123> but that is really unfortunately, as it means normal javascript arrays cannot be stored/parsed in json.
[12:34:35] <BillCriswell> NaN just isn't valid in JSON as far as I know.
[12:34:46] <Velveeta> ok aolko, try something like this, and then i'll explain what changed: http://pastie.org/8578163
[12:36:06] <speaker123> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1423081/json-left-out-infinity-and-nan-json-status-in-ecmascript
[12:37:05] <BillCriswell> Ah, well there you go.
[12:37:13] <speaker123> BillCriswell, yeah, seems so.  perhaps good reasons.  since i trust the json file and don't let people inject, is it safe to just run eval?
[12:37:40] <speaker123> ...not sure if my statement "i don't let people inject" is accurate.
[12:37:59] <speaker123> its a static webpage.
[12:38:11] <aolko> okay, another tiny bit, can sorting by time be done? i.e. 12:30, 13:30, 14:30 etc
[12:39:27] <Velveeta> it can be done, sure, just add a sorting function… wouldn't it be easier to sort them server side and push the xml in an already-sorted state?
[12:39:41] <aolko> hmmm, how?
[12:40:09] <BillCriswell> I'd guess so but I'm really not sure. Definitely not my strong point.
[12:40:17] <Velveeta> how to sort the data before writing the xml?
[12:40:53] <aolko> how to sort by time after loading xml and before outputting it
[12:41:14] <Velveeta> aolko: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[12:42:41] <aolko> i don't quite get it
[12:43:11] <BillCriswell> You looked at it for a whole minute and didn't get it?
[12:44:45] <petey> if I use something like (.mega-menu) in a ton of different places, is it better to cache .mega-menu and use .find() to find the selector im looking for?
[12:44:53] <aolko> yep, sometimes i'm like that
[12:45:03] <Velveeta> petey: yep
[12:45:18] <Velveeta> aolko: well take a shot at it, you're not gonna learn anything if you don't put in some effort
[12:45:53] <aolko> brb
[12:49:50] <Siecje1> so I am using jqueryui and sortable and when I re-arrange my table and view the source the source doesn't change.
[12:50:07] <Velveeta> the source won't ever change
[12:50:25] <Velveeta> the source is the way the markup was initially received by the browser
[12:50:25] <zulcc> inside a .load('some.php', function() {      }); how do you re-trigger this exact load and everything inside the callback function?
[12:50:25] <Siecje1> I want to store the order in the database
[12:50:52] <Velveeta> that's fine, but you're not gonna pull that order from the source, you can pull it from the DOM itself, but viewing the source doesn't show you the current, modified state of the DOM
[12:51:13] <Siecje1> Velveeta: for some reason the order I get in the back end is always the same
[12:51:27] <Velveeta> zulcc: move the callback function out into a named function vs an anonymous one, and pass the function name to it and any other code you need to pass it to
[12:51:59] <Velveeta> siecje1: then you'll need to examine the code that serializing it for transport
[12:52:22] <zulcc> Velveeta: ah, thanks. that's what i wanted to avoid, but i guess there is no other way
[12:52:40] <Velveeta> zulcc: not unless you wanna copy and paste it to pass anonymously everywhere else :D
[12:52:54] <Velveeta> it's actually better practice to do it with named functions, because then you can unit test those callbacks
[12:53:22] <Siecje1> https://dpaste.de/iHtX
[12:55:19] <Siecje1> before I was able to use .sortable('serialize'); but that doesn't seem to be working
[12:56:23] <Velveeta> siecje1: hm, i don't see why that *shouldn't* work...
[12:56:28] <Velveeta> but it's not working?
[12:57:47] <Siecje1> right, the list is always 1, 2
[12:58:28] <Velveeta> can you throw together a jsfiddle demo of it?
[12:59:51] <Siecje1> http://jsfiddle.net/rh6fD/16/ yeah open the console and re-order the skills and click the green button
[13:01:51] <micz123> hi all
[13:02:00] <Velveeta> heya micz123
[13:02:19] <micz123> wanted to ask a question
[13:02:34] <micz123> is $(document) the same as $('document') ?
[13:02:41] <Velveeta> nope
[13:03:02] <micz123> ah ic
[13:04:51] <Siecje1> what does $('document') do?
[13:05:18] <micz123> lets say i set a variable var type and i put it inside $(type).trigger(click); i need to set it to type = document and not type = 'document' ?
[13:06:05] <Velveeta> right
[13:06:19] <Velveeta> siecje1: $('document') would try to find all 'document' tags in the document and return them
[13:06:28] <Velveeta> same as like $('div')
[13:06:50] <Velveeta> siecje1: i can see your issue, looking through your markup for a minute
[13:07:09] <Siecje1> you can create your own tags like that then? They won't be displayed in the browser, or they might be.
[13:07:21] <micz123> velveeta i want to get the value for var type from json object
[13:07:22] <duch_kazatel> Siecje1 nope.  you can't create your own tags.
[13:08:05] <micz123> for example lets say the json object is {'document':'click'}
[13:08:11] <Velveeta> micz123: you could always do some quick substitution like this: type = (type == 'document' ? document : type)
[13:08:40] <Velveeta> custom tags are entirely possible
[13:08:54] <Velveeta> they display as inline, i believe, if the browser doesn't recognize them
[13:09:09] <duch_kazatel> if the browser doesn't crap on itself, right?  IE8 hates custom tags.
[13:09:28] <Velveeta> yeah depending on your support matrix
[13:09:31] <duch_kazatel> there's a proposed spec for HTML5 that adds a custom tag API
[13:09:43] <Velveeta> right, i think it's part of the web component proposal
[13:09:53] <micz123_> sorry i got disconnected
[13:10:05] <micz123_> velveeta thx for ur help :D
[13:10:22] <Velveeta> no problem, did you see my last message to you?
[13:10:29] <Velveeta> micz123: you could always do some quick substitution like this: type = (type == 'document' ? document : type)
[13:10:35] <micz123_> yes i did
[13:10:39] <Velveeta> ok cool
[13:11:22] <micz123_> is that ternary?
[13:11:26] <Velveeta> yep
[13:11:48] <micz123_> nice :D
[13:12:56] <Velveeta> also, ie7 and 8 (i *believe*) can handle custom tags as long as you use their document.createElement quirk
[13:13:17] <duch_kazatel> you have to create the element first with javascript, sure, but I prefer to avoid custom tags.
[13:13:17] <aolko> first attempt in sorting http://pastie.org/8578230
[13:13:22] <Velveeta> i have an experimental widget library based on custom tags that i do something like that for, at the time they're run through the widget factory
[13:13:29] <Velveeta> right
[13:13:31] <aolko> based on http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-sorting-the-xml-data-date-wise-an-ascending-descending-order-using-jquery-or-javascript
[13:13:37] <micz123_> i hv another question, but i think i'll paste it first
[13:17:33] <aolko> so, Velveeta, what do you think?
[13:17:47] <micz123_> velveeta http://paste.laravel.com/1hBK can i do something like this?
[13:18:04] <micz123_> i meant, i tried this but its not working haha
[13:18:26] <micz123_> so i was wondering how do i achieve that... its somekind of extending class in php
[13:18:59] <micz123_> because i want to create some other prototypes and use some of the same variables
[13:20:20] <Velveeta> aolko: you'll need to store your jQuery(xmlData).find('program') off to another variable, then sort *that* variable, and then .each over it
[13:20:24] <duch_kazatel> micz123_ you should probably go read up about scoping in JS - the first var is scoped under the "Trigger" function.
[13:22:09] <micz123_> ducj_katazel ugh forgot
[13:22:13] <micz123_> let me revise
[13:22:59] <duch_kazatel> micz123_ the other approach would be to write your functions and then pass around a big object that has all of your properties/values and share that way instead.
[13:23:03] <micz123_> duch_katazel belveeta http://paste.laravel.com/1hBL
[13:23:27] <micz123_> duch_katazel can u give me example?
[13:24:09] <Velveeta> micz123_: that 'type' variable is still gonna be locally scoped to your constructor function, you need to assign it to this.type or something if you want it to be accessable in the prototype methods
[13:24:44] <Velveeta> same with event
[13:25:10] <micz123_> ah ok let me try that :D
[13:28:17] <codepython777> I'm trying to include a html file inside my html file using -> $("#includedContent").load("b.html");  and inside the test.html file -> <div id="includedContent"></div>. How can i specify b.html in the html file as well?
[13:29:04] <duch_kazatel> codepython777 wat.
[13:29:13] <Velveeta> i'm not quite sure what you're asking either
[13:29:24] <jphase> `shrug
[13:29:24] <b-ot> jphase: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[13:29:26] <Velveeta> you seem to have the right function for it already, .load() should work just fine
[13:30:03] <Siecje1> Velveeta: any idea why the array is always the same http://jsfiddle.net/rh6fD/16/
[13:30:22] <codepython777> ah. I should have changed it into a class. I want to use this line: <div id="includedContent">b.html</div> - to load b.html at this place
[13:30:32] <codepython777> sorry: <div class="includedContent"></div>
[13:30:39] <Velveeta> siecje1: oh yeah, sorry, i got sidetracked, let me get back to that
[13:30:48] <duch_kazatel> codepython777 huh?  You're trying to target a div and load content into it?
[13:30:52] <codepython777> yes
[13:31:04] <Velveeta> i think he's wanting to generically specify the content to be loaded also
[13:31:12] <codepython777> duch_kazatel: <div class="includedContent">b.html</div> -- should be replaced by the div contained inside b.html at load time
[13:31:42] <Velveeta> so you'd have to do something like this: $('.includedContent').each(function () { $(this).load($(this).text()); });
[13:31:55] <duch_kazatel> was just about to paste something similar!
[13:31:58] <Velveeta> something like that i'm guessing, is what you're trying to do
[13:31:58] <aolko> http://pastie.org/8578272 different-ish approach
[13:32:07] * Velveeta high-fives duch_kazatel!
[13:32:30] <codepython777> thanks. trying that now
[13:32:38] <duch_kazatel> javascript++
[13:33:26] <Velveeta> aolko: that's pretty close, the only problem i can see with it is that the .get() function will return an array of those elements, which sort is perfectly valid to use on, but it won't modify the existing jquery collection order
[13:33:50] <aolko> so, any corrections?
[13:33:53] <Velveeta> you'll want to store the .get() into another variable, sort it, and then wrap it in a $() to turn it back into a jquery collection you can iterate over
[13:34:04] <aolko> %)
[13:34:06] <aolko> wow
[13:34:15] <Velveeta> siecje1: taking another look at yours
[13:34:39] <aolko> now here i dunno how to do it right...
[13:34:44] <Velveeta> siecje1: oh yeah, now i remember where i left off in it, you have invalid html structure in your markup
[13:34:49] <aolko> or maybe at all...
[13:35:02] <Velveeta> aolko: i just gave you the steps you needed to do, you're almost there
[13:37:29] <Velveeta> siecje1: you have forms wrapping each <tr> element, with the hidden input inside of that (but outside the tr) that tracks its order
[13:37:45] <Velveeta> when a row is dragged around in the sortable, it's leaving behind its form wrapper and input
[13:37:52] <Siecje1> true
[13:38:10] <Velveeta> you can move the form into the first td of each row
[13:38:20] <Siecje1> thank you
[13:38:28] <Velveeta> no problem
[13:40:00] <petey> I used to get a value when I ran a global variable boxPosition for example, but now I'm getting [object Object] instead
[13:40:04] <aolko> http://pastie.org/8578291 is this right?
[13:40:08] <petey> is there anything I screwed up that comes to mind?
[13:40:32] <duch_kazatel> petey have a code sample?
[13:41:02] <codepython777> Velveeta: That worked on my webserver. But on my local machine, when i open the html using chrome, I get this error: Failed to load resource: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access. - anyway i can fix this?
[13:41:05] <petey> Let me see if I can recreate this
[13:41:22] <duch_kazatel> codepython777 you have to run it via a webserver.
[13:41:45] <Velveeta> aolko: that's close, you can scrap the programSort variable, and just use the program variable, and after you sort it, instead of using .each() on programSort, use it like this: $(program).each
[13:41:52] <Velveeta> that *should* do it i think
[13:41:57] <jphase> petey: console.log(boxPosition); and then use boxPosition.key  to grab a specific value
[13:42:09] <codepython777> duch_kazatel: thanks
[13:42:11] <jphase> where key is the object key in your console you want
[13:43:25] <Velveeta> afk a few minutes, have to run to a store real quick
[13:43:32] <duch_kazatel> enjoy
[13:43:52] <aolko> right? http://pastebin.com/a0d0YmTp
[13:43:57] <petey> I must have screwed something up in my code, because my global variable boxPosition is correct, it's somewhere down the line where it gets screwed up.
[13:44:56] <jphase> codepython777: You can't .load external resources (from another domain) unless the remote server is setup to do so, so that won't work
[13:46:07] <jphase> codepython777: you could setup your server to do so with apache/nginx/whatever or you could just put the code on the same server it's pulling resources from.
[13:46:55] <codepython777> jphase: I was trying to render it without a server. Just using local FS and firefox.
[13:48:26] <jphase> codepython777: you cannot .load resources through the file protocol
[13:48:27] <petey> http://jsbin.com/aBUnIRa/1/edit
[13:48:33] <petey> this is literally what I have and shit's hitting the fan
[13:48:36] <petey> [object Object]
[13:48:43] <petey> but the top boxPosition before I click anything else works fine
[13:49:18] <jphase> petey: you want something like boxPosition.top or boxPosition.left
[13:50:09] <petey> ohh
[13:50:11] <petey> you are right
[13:50:15] <petey> I missed your point earlier
[13:50:32] <petey> but see, why does the top boxPosition result in Object { top: 0, left: 0}
[13:51:04] <jphase> petey: because the position is an object of top and left properties so you'll need to access the object's keys (top and left) to get the values you want
[13:51:25] <petey> I see
[13:51:46] <aolko> err...
[13:51:55] <jphase> http://api.jquery.com/position/
[13:51:56] <petey> that now makes sense
[13:51:56] <petey> sigh
[13:52:10] <jphase> hehe, all good, happens to the best of us ;\
[13:52:26] <_biff> hi...how could i set url without refresh page...location.hash place a # mark and after that the url what i would set to
[13:52:54] <duch_kazatel> _biff history.pushState and history.replaceState both do that.
[13:52:59] <_biff> no html5
[13:53:03] <duch_kazatel> then you can't.
[13:53:07] <_biff> ??
[13:53:14] <_biff> dont make me crazy...
[13:53:31] <duch_kazatel> you get history.pushState() and location.hash.
[13:53:40] <duch_kazatel> nothing else really exists.
[13:53:42] <duch_kazatel> afaik
[13:53:47] <_biff> but location.hash not working...
[13:53:50] <_biff> pfff
[13:53:52] <_biff> great
[13:53:59] <duch_kazatel> how is location.hash not "working"?
[13:54:10] <_biff> makes http://127.0.0.1/messages/?k=fffff#www.index.hu
[13:54:17] <_biff> not www.index.hu
[13:54:36] <duch_kazatel> right, location.hash just updates the hash of the URL.
[13:54:45] <_biff> aham
[13:54:57] <duch_kazatel> do you need to support IE9 and below?
[13:55:02] <_biff> no
[13:55:15] <_biff> dont
[13:55:18] <shoky> :\
[13:55:27] <duch_kazatel> oh wait you want to update the domain, too?
[13:55:30] <duch_kazatel> not sure you can do that.
[13:55:42] <_biff> not really..im jsut typing a test url
[13:55:52] <_biff> so i dont want to change the domain
[13:55:57] <_biff> i would refresh a paramtere
[13:55:59] <petey> Still no luck
[13:56:00] <duch_kazatel> then use pushstates.
[13:56:04] <duch_kazatel> that's exactly what they're there for.
[13:56:08] <petey> If i copy and paste the selector, then I get the right position
[13:56:16] <petey> but if I run the variable I have assigned to it, it doesn't work
[13:56:16] <petey> argh
[13:56:34] <petey> http://jsbin.com/aBUnIRa/1/edit
[13:56:55] <petey> what can I be doing wrong that I keep getting a position of 0?
[13:57:34] <duch_kazatel> petey which value?
[13:57:50] <jphase> petey: your console.log(boxPosition); shows 8 for me
[13:58:05] <petey> in that stupid example everything works
[13:58:09] <petey> but my code is frickin broken, argh
[14:01:51] <_biff> duch_kazatel but i dont use html5
[14:02:02] <_biff> :)
[14:02:09] <duch_kazatel> _biff then you're SOL.
[14:02:15] <duch_kazatel> why not use it?
[14:02:22] <_biff> sol?:)
[14:02:29] <duch_kazatel> shit outta luck
[14:02:33] <_biff> cause i write everything in html4
[14:02:40] <_biff> i wrote
[14:02:46] <_biff> i dont wanna rewrite
[14:03:03] <duch_kazatel> errr, you should be able to use the javascript API without issues...
[14:03:42] <tw2113> 80% of html4 is still valid in html5
[14:03:45] <tw2113> that's an estimate
[14:03:49] <_biff> duch_kazatel ok i just thought that there is a simple solution for this
[14:03:51] <duch_kazatel> i'd wager more than that,
[14:04:07] <duch_kazatel> _biff there is - use pushstates ;) that's what you get.
[14:04:11] <_biff> :)
[14:04:12] <_biff> ok
[14:04:17] <_biff> thx
[14:05:44] <Velveeta> back
[14:05:58] <Velveeta> i leave for a few minutes and tw and shoky show up to the party
[14:06:13] <aolko> Velveeta http://pastebin.com/a0d0YmTp
[14:06:46] <Velveeta> aolko: yeah, that looks about right, does it work?
[14:06:59] <aolko> ше вщуытэе ашдеук
[14:07:01] <aolko> oops
[14:07:07] <aolko> it doesnt filter
[14:07:13] <aolko> somehow
[14:07:21] <Velveeta> filter, or sort?
[14:07:46] <aolko> well, output is still unsorted
[14:07:49] <Velveeta> also, your sort function is using the date node, not the time one
[14:07:58] <aolko> oops
[14:08:56] <aolko> even tho, same thing
[14:09:02] <aolko> no result on output
[14:09:19] <Velveeta> is the output unsorted, or are you getting no output?
[14:09:26] <aolko> unsorted
[14:10:39] <Velveeta> aolko: can you throw your sample xml up onto a pastebin again?
[14:11:29] <aolko> http://pastebin.com/BrrfNsf9
[14:11:41] <shoky> hey Velveeta ;p
[14:11:45] <aolko> it shold be like 12:30 -> 13:30 -> etc
[14:11:47] <Velveeta> heya shoky :)
[14:18:29] <aolko> :(
[14:18:56] <Velveeta> aolko: here's your problem
[14:19:15] <Velveeta> in your sort function, you were doing a console.log() of what the return value should be (-1, +1, or 0), but not actually returning the value
[14:19:20] <Velveeta> so it wasn't sorting anything
[14:19:28] <Velveeta> change that console.log to return
[14:20:05] <aolko> now we're talking
[14:20:16] <aolko> it finally worked
[14:21:06] <Velveeta> woo hoo!
[14:21:15] <Velveeta> and you solved the problem yourself
[14:23:05] <aolko> :)
[14:31:07] <bigbugjava> http://www.plupload.com/download.php, there is licence type: GPLv2 , it's free.. can I use it for my site, I dont understand what they want
[14:35:43] <duch_kazatel> bigbugjava here's a primer: http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/gpl
[14:37:56] <Velveeta> i hate dealing with license types
[14:38:00] <duch_kazatel> same here.
[14:38:04] <Velveeta> there's like 37 different flavors of "free"
[14:38:28] <duch_kazatel> http://www.tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v2-%28gpl-2%29
[14:38:43] <Velveeta> there we go, dumb it down for me :D
[14:38:50] <duch_kazatel> bigbugjava, basically, you can use it, but you have to then make your work GPLv2 and make its source freely available.
[14:39:53] <datarecal> I am trying to figure out why an on click event is not firing, I am guessting it is conflicting with another js is there a good way to do it with firebug ?
[14:40:28] <duch_kazatel> datarecal you can check to make sure that the element you want to bind to first exists.
[14:40:32] <Velveeta> datarecal: sometimes click events don't fire because another element is overlapping the one you're trying to click on, even if transparently
[14:40:32] <datarecal> the on click even works when i strip it out and put it in jsfiddle so something else is going on
[14:41:17] <bigbugjava> duch_kazatel I see they are runnig php
[14:41:20] <bigbugjava> with javascript
[14:41:27] <bigbugjava> not good for me
[14:41:40] <bigbugjava> project must be 100% JavaScript
[14:41:40] <duch_kazatel> bigbugjava ... huh?
[14:41:48] <duch_kazatel> bigbugjava okay?
[14:41:52] <bigbugjava> duch_kazatel thx :)
[14:42:04] * Velveeta scratches his head.
[14:42:31] <datarecal> is there any way to see which elements will fire on click of a div/class ?
[14:43:14] <Velveeta> there used to be an add-on for firebug called firequery, which would show you bound jquery data in the dom inspector
[14:43:21] <Velveeta> not sure if it's still in development or not
[14:43:24] <duch_kazatel> IE11 also has that feature baked in.
[14:43:30] <Velveeta> nice!
[14:43:56] <duch_kazatel> yeah, their dev tools are surprisingly good now
[14:44:06] <Velveeta> outside of that, you'd probably have to iterate over the $.cache object and find which elements had a click event listener, and if they were a parent of the one you were curious about
[14:44:32] <Velveeta> duch_kazatel: yeah, i saw a brief demo of them during jqconf in austin a few months ago, but didn't realize they had baked in jquery info like that
[14:44:52] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta not jquery info - just event handlers, but they'll tell you where in your code.
[14:44:57] <Velveeta> i was already impressed by the jumps they'd made on those dev tools without even knowing about that
[14:45:02] <Velveeta> ahhhh gotcha
[14:45:02] <aolko> i think, i found a bug
[14:45:27] <Velveeta> aolko: that's entirely possible
[14:45:31] <aolko> on page refresh items that fade out recently appear again
[14:45:51] <Velveeta> oh yeah, well that's not exactly a bug, just something that was never written in to begin with
[14:46:11] <Velveeta> you'll need to check not only currentDate when you output those items, but also currentTime
[14:46:15] <aolko> like it's item w/ time 2:40, now 2:45, it fade out, on refresh page it appears again
[14:46:23] <Velveeta> and make sure currentTime <= the program time
[14:47:43] <Velveeta> to simplify the process of getting current date and time in your code, in the format you use, e.g. DD.MM.YYYY and HH:MM, you may want to take the part that's currently concatenating that string, and move it out into its own named function, like getDate() and getTime(), and then call those from within processXML() and that setInterval
[14:47:57] <Velveeta> then you can just add a reference to getTime() within processXML to add that functionality
[14:49:16] <aolko> well, i decreased interval and AFTER that interval they disappeared
[14:49:50] <Velveeta> well yeah, they'll disappear just fine, but i would think you don't even want them to be written out if they're already expired
[14:50:20] <aolko> maybe it should be like, page refreshes, script founds expired ones, ignoring them show the rest
[14:50:53] <Velveeta> right
[14:51:01] <Velveeta> and for that, you need to add a time check to processXML()
[14:51:17] <Velveeta> so it should not only be that the currentDate matches, but also that the currentTime <= program time
[14:55:18] <bigbugjava> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'parseMetaData' of undefined, When selecting file to upload with https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[14:55:32] <bigbugjava> all js and css were loaded okay. any1 has a clue?
[14:57:55] <Velveeta> that's just a link to a github page
[14:58:25] <duch_kazatel> bigbugjava without seeing the code it's hard to know, but it sounds like you're not actually submitting a file.
[14:58:30] <Velveeta> what file did that error get thrown in? what's the source of the parseMetaData function? how are you trying to call it, or is the error being thrown internally?
[14:59:08] <aolko> http://pastebin.com/Wa6GLtVZ am i right?
[15:00:45] <bigbugjava> I actualy just used guide, change it to load right for me site, it used with basic, basic plus .. haa getting that erorr, let me figure what you asked me to understand, a bit noob with that plugin
[15:00:59] <bigbugjava> * meant it worked with basic
[15:03:06] <Velveeta> aolko: you have that logic slightly backwards, you want currentTime <= time, not time <= currentTime :)
[15:03:38] <datarecal> $('.addnewlp').on('click', function(e){ is the proper way to detect a click on content that is dynamically loaded correct ?
[15:04:28] <Velveeta> datarecal: not dynamically loaded content, that's for existing content
[15:04:34] <duch_kazatel> datarecal that's one way, but you have to bind that after	the element's loaded.
[15:04:48] <An_Ony_Moose> is there a replacement for the apparently deprecated load function? Should I simply use .on("load", function(){...}) ?
[15:04:55] <duch_kazatel> $('parentSelector').on('click', '.addnewlp', function(e){
[15:04:57] <duch_kazatel> that's what you want.
[15:04:59] <Velveeta> you want something like this: $(document).on('click', '.addnewlp', function (e) {
[15:05:02] <aolko> and fadeIn() goes before appendTo()?
[15:05:04] <Velveeta> yeah there we go
[15:05:06] <datarecal> I can't put that in the <head> and it would monitor all clicks to that class ?
[15:05:26] <duch_kazatel> datarecal as long as you use a valid parent Selector, yeah.
[15:05:29] <Velveeta> datarecal: not the way you currently have it written, no
[15:05:31] <duch_kazatel> but it's not directly monitoring that class.
[15:05:35] <bigbugjava> I really have no clue, just the same like orginal, doesn't wonnawork
[15:06:02] <Velveeta> aolko: if you want to fade it in, you'll want to hide it first, then appendTo, then fadeIn
[15:06:25] <duch_kazatel> datarecal the version you had binds to an element directly.  the version velveeta and I showed you makes use of event delegation.
[15:06:35] <datarecal> wow thanks guys 2 hours of me trying to figure out why that wouldnt fire
[15:06:43] <Velveeta> :D
[15:07:00] <duch_kazatel> go check out the MDN docs about events.
[15:08:01] <Velveeta> and then the first lord of the rings movie, because bilbo's eleventy-first birthday event was all about delegating
[15:08:11] <Velveeta> and because those movies are awesome
[15:08:45] <aolko> trying .html('<li style="display: none;" but it stays
[15:09:32] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaaaahahahahaha thgat's actually a funny way to put that.
[15:10:04] <Velveeta> aolko: can you show me an updated paste?
[15:10:42] <aolko> http://pastebin.com/TKksMfvB
[15:15:27] <Velveeta> aolko: you have the display: none on the wrong element, it should be on the ul, not the li
[15:17:17] <aolko> now, for now aspect
[15:17:27] <aolko> i guess it's quite the same
[15:17:50] <Velveeta> now aspect? as in what's the current show?
[15:18:01] <aolko> if you didn't get it - NOW: Item, but there's a thing
[15:18:25] <aolko> it won't hold a minute before it disappears
[15:18:48] <Velveeta> yeah, it would *only* hold a minute before disappearing
[15:19:11] <aolko> but it should hold Item-next:time - Current-item:time
[15:19:46] <Velveeta> i don't understand what you're saying there
[15:20:09] <aolko> it should stay "now" till next item start time
[15:20:27] <aolko> when next item starts it becomes "now"
[15:20:32] <Velveeta> then you're gonna need to rewrite the logic in the setInterval function
[15:20:34] <aolko> and so on
[15:22:07] <aolko> can you suggest? it's 3am now, and i have only half of brain power now %)
[15:28:51] <bigbugjava> Velveeta I saw on page people with same error, reminder() lol
[15:29:13] <bigbugjava> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'parseMetaData' of undefined jquery file upload
[15:29:25] <bigbugjava> So I went and grap the needed file

[15:29:58] <bigbugjava> Now I get error Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <
[15:30:11] <bigbugjava> witch is weird cause it tells Nothinggg
[15:30:22] <Velveeta> aolko: i'm testing something now
[15:30:57] <Velveeta> bigbugjava: does it give you the line number?
[15:31:26] <Velveeta> aolko: in your setInterval function, the line that you fadeOut, change it to this: $this.parent().prev().fadeOut();
[15:32:14] <bigbugjava> jquery-latest.js:612
[15:32:54] <aolko> you disappointed parent(), it wants 1 argument
[15:33:23] <bigbugjava> Velveeta I think I need to load all files to local server
[15:34:18] <Velveeta> parent doesn't require an argument
[15:34:28] <Velveeta> the argument is optional
[15:34:45] <Kamuela> I'm having a problem with meteor in that I don't know exactly how to use jQuery 2 with it. I did the $.fn.jquery() or version(), can't remember the actual thing, and it shows me jQuery v 1.8.2 no matter how I try to forcefully include jquery 2.0.3
[15:34:49] <Velveeta> aolko: i made a couple of other changes too, look here: http://jsfiddle.net/FYLjx/20/
[15:34:57] <Velveeta> change the xml times to your local timezone
[15:35:20] <Velveeta> there's a new span in the "li" element now, which is hidden by css unless the li has the "current" class
[15:35:32] <Velveeta> that way, you can get that "NOW" label that you're wanting
[15:40:01] <aolko> they are all now now :)
[15:41:12] <Velveeta> you have to put in the css to hide them by default
[15:41:20] <Velveeta> the css is in the upper right corner of that fiddle page
[15:45:03] <datarecal> http://jsfiddle.net/y82Em/ is there a better way to accomplish this: it also seems that it isnt grabbing the data-type attribute
[15:45:56] <datarecal> im trying to loop through each select group with the .LanderID class which it seems to be doing but not grabbing the data-type attr
[15:46:49] <duch_kazatel> datarecal how are you the data-type attr?
[15:46:57] <Velveeta> can you post some sample markup?
[15:46:59] <duch_kazatel> *how are you setting
[15:48:58] <datarecal> yup one sec adding in html now
[15:49:26] <Velveeta> and don't forget to add in your jquery dependency in the upper left
[15:50:30] <aolko> i have it by default :)
[15:50:58] <Velveeta> aolko: got it working?
[15:51:01] <datarecal> http://jsfiddle.net/y82Em/1/
[15:51:22] <datarecal> basically what I am trying to do is if the select boxes data-types are the same then do nothing if they are not error out
[15:51:28] <aolko> yes, BUT now entries disappear on refresh before expiring (as i can see)
[15:53:43] <Velveeta> datarecal: 'this' in your callback is the option, not the select element
[15:53:57] <Velveeta> so your call to .find(':selected') isn't finding anything
[15:54:21] <Velveeta> aolko: can i see an updated paste?
[15:54:28] <aolko> yes
[15:54:36] <datarecal> http://jsfiddle.net/y82Em/3/
[15:54:38] <duch_kazatel> also I'd check the scoping - newnumoffers needs to be declared higher up so it's available to both functions.
[15:55:05] <aolko> http://pastebin.com/Cxjkzjfy
[15:57:07] <Velveeta> aolko: and everything is fading out on load?
[15:57:32] <aolko> only now entries are fading on refresh
[15:57:46] <Velveeta> are they expired?
[15:58:59] <datarecal> http://jsfiddle.net/y82Em/4/ got it working, is that the proper way to do it ?
[15:59:37] <duch_kazatel> datarecal do it inside of the .on() imo.
[16:01:48] <bigbugjava> for jquery file upload, I must have php server? from forums it seems like that
[16:01:49] <bigbugjava> this
[16:03:10] <Velveeta> you don't need a php server, but you do need a webserver of some kind
[16:03:42] <bigbugjava> it's on Node.js
[16:03:56] <Velveeta> that should be fine
[16:04:11] <Velveeta> the client has no idea what the back end server is running, it doesn't care
[16:04:15] <bigbugjava> I have downloaded all links and now I dont get that old problem
[16:04:46] <bigbugjava> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <  but that one popuped
[16:06:51] <aolko> well, next program is not started so they shouldn't
[16:07:55] <Velveeta> aolko: show me your current xml, and let me know what the current time is up there
[16:08:28] <aolko> http://pastebin.com/QaJRLP8a
[16:08:30] <aolko> 4:07
[16:09:39] <aolko> 1-st refresh "now" is still holding, 2-nd refresh - it disappears
[16:14:07] <Velveeta> aolko: not sure why that's happening then, you may have to debug it by setting some breakpoints and seeing what's going on, unless this thing is on a live site somewhere
[16:14:53] <aolko> it is

[17:05:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> probably unrelated
[17:05:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> but anyone have a tutorial for ember js that is current
[17:05:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> for ember js version 1.2.0
[18:16:48] <Siecje> I am using jquery ui sortable to re-arrange <tr>s in a table, but in the <tr> is a form and I cannot click in the form field. I assume because it is the drag and drop click event http://jsfiddle.net/rh6fD/17/
[18:16:48] <Siecje> I would like the entire row to be moved but it would be nice to only move it when a td with an icon is clicked.
[18:33:22] <benjick> Hi. I have a list of tracks for an audio player and the current track is being set to class="active"
[18:33:35] <benjick> Is there a good way for me to display the closest siblings to that class?
[18:33:45] <benjick> Like, the song before and after
[18:35:26] <Siecje> benjick: they are in the same list ? Like <ol> or <ul>?
[18:35:39] <tw2113> ?prev
[18:35:46] <benjick> Siecje: yes
[18:35:48] <tw2113> `prev
[18:35:48] <dreamingrainbow> Can some one help me with this, I am new to jquery but this is what I got http://jsfiddle.net/x2L5D/
[18:35:53] <tw2113> .prev
[18:35:58] <tw2113> bah, stupid bot
[18:36:10] <tw2113> us .prev() and .next()
[18:36:32] <benjick> tw2113: thank you
[18:37:10] <benjick> so, while im'
[18:37:24] <tw2113> dreamingrainbow, wouldn't you need to use "selected" and not "checked" ?
[18:37:25] <benjick> i'm here, is there a way to set remove all occurances of class X?
[18:37:25] <dreamingrainbow> By the example I hope you can tell what I wanna do, When someone clicks the div I want to make the radio selected, and the rest in the group unselected.
[18:38:15] <tw2113> why not just use a <label> ?
[18:47:59] <dreamingrainbow> I have gotten it to select the radio with onclick=" $('#id').attrib('checked',true);" placed on the div.
[18:53:44] <systemfault> I'd be surprised... that's invalid code.
[18:58:46] <dreamingrainbow> nice i see attrib was wrong to start.. I originally had attr sorry for the misinformation.
[19:01:01] <systemfault> But seriously, if unless you use a REALLY old version of jQuery, you want .prop, not .attr
[19:02:05] <dblosevn> systemfault: pretty sure even in really old versions .prop was still the method to use, .attr used to do more then it should back then however
[19:02:58] <systemfault> dblosevn: Back in the days, .prop wasn't existing, the jQuery guys really tried to merge the concept of properties and attributes... but it didn't work.
[19:03:32] <dblosevn> not at all, was too hard to maintain the state of the property and the attrib
[19:03:51] <systemfault> Right
[19:03:59] <systemfault> .prop was added in 1.6
[19:04:19] <dblosevn>  checked=checked (click uncheck) $(selector).attrib('checked') == checked
[19:04:51] <dreamingrainbow> http://jsfiddle.net/x2L5D/8/
[19:05:23] <dblosevn> used to have to do crazy shit like if ($(selector).get(0).checked)
[19:05:35] <systemfault> dblosevn: Eww :/
[19:05:45] <dblosevn> ya, .prop is a godsend
[19:06:18] <dreamingrainbow> i see no difference between prop and attr  http://jsfiddle.net/x2L5D/9/
[19:06:30] <systemfault> dreamingrainbow: That .attr thing will work for you.. until you try .attr('checked', false).... then you'll wonder "WHY THE F ISN'T THAT WORKING??!??!?!"
[19:06:35] <dblosevn> your not holding your tongue right Dreamer3
[19:06:49] <dblosevn> ** dreamingrainbow
[19:06:59] <systemfault> dreamingrainbow: That's because you don't understand the difference between a property and an attribute.
[19:07:17] <dblosevn> or until the checkbox is unchecked by the user and still holds the attrib checked
[19:08:02] <dblosevn> the property checked will be false but the attrib checked will still be set
[19:08:32] <dreamingrainbow> systemfault i can see by your above statement why one over the other, I just said I saw no obvious difference.
[19:08:55] <dblosevn> Isnt there an awesome example of that at the bottom of the .prop docs? thought it shouled when .attr failed and .prop prevailed
[19:09:06] <dblosevn> shows
[19:09:59] <dreamingrainbow> ok but again i still have the same issue.
[19:10:04] <dblosevn> Ya there is, prefect example of the shortcomings of attr right at the bottom of
[19:10:07] <dblosevn> `api prop
[19:10:08] <b-ot> dblosevn: .prop(): Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[19:11:33] <Armistice> Hello. The warning which is probably a common: event.returnValue is deprecated. Please use the standard event.preventDefault() instead. ... This comes up even though I am using event.preventDefault();?
[19:11:41] <dreamingrainbow> http://jsfiddle.net/x2L5D/9/ i use prop, and on the second two you can see i have onclicks that work, but the problem lies in when you select one then another the backgroud doesnt hide for one not sure how to accomplish this
[19:14:42] <dblosevn> dreamingrainbow: why are you mixing inline js and a script file? that makes it really hard to help you.
[19:15:28] <dreamingrainbow> the bottom two divs with the inline are just an example of kinda what I want the function is the overall goal
[19:20:06] <Siecje> How can I click in the text fields in the form. And only drag and drop the rows if I click the crossing arrows http://jsfiddle.net/rh6fD/18/
[19:22:55] <jlmitch5> hey y'all, I have a strange jquery ui bug on a site that I'm developing, and I was wondering if there was anyone here that could help me figure out what's going on
[19:23:26] <dreamingrainbow> my goal when done is onclick a border is on only the select option,
[19:23:42] <dreamingrainbow> div/
[19:25:35] <dblosevn> dreamingrainbow: http://jsfiddle.net/4z8sA/
[19:27:05] <jlmitch5> It's in the program components section here: http://caldwellfellows.ncsu.edu/mission/.  when you expand to a different tab, it pulls the old container to the bottom before it removes it from display in this kind of awkward way
[19:27:55] <jlmitch5> Not sure how to target the container to get it to "display:none" before it has a chance to push down
[19:29:03] <dblosevn> dreamingrainbow: also my method gets rid of the need for all thoughs ids
[19:30:09] <Siecje> ok you can set a handle
[19:30:38] <dreamingrainbow> yea i have the id's on the elements anyway, but the problem is that where the class happens to be the same "colors-10" they are often not the same. but you gave me the information i need to write what i want I beleive ill give it a shot.
[19:31:24] <dblosevn> well if its not always color-10 just add another dummy class to all the wrapper divs
[19:31:41] <dblosevn> much cleaner then inline js
[19:32:53] <dblosevn> use data- attribs for things like (this, db_type, ["SQLite","Mysql","PostgreSql"], "SQLite" )... eg data-dbtype="SQLite" var dbtype = $(this).data('dbtype')
[19:34:21] <dblosevn> then your code is all bundled in one nice clean listner and easy to make changes
[19:34:28] <dblosevn> @ dreamingrainbow
[19:36:57] <dreamingrainbow>  ["SQLite","Mysql","PostgreSql"] are the options and "SQLite" was the choice, i thought i would iterate through the array and deselect all but the selected option
[19:38:17] <dblosevn> dreamingrainbow: http://jsfiddle.net/4z8sA/1/
[19:38:20] <dblosevn> like that
[19:40:09] <dreamingrainbow> http://jsfiddle.net/4z8sA/2/ see the problem here
[19:40:56] <dblosevn> dreamingrainbow: or even simpler http://jsfiddle.net/4z8sA/4/ using the value of the radios being there the same
[19:42:18] <dblosevn> dreamingrainbow: problem solved... http://jsfiddle.net/4z8sA/6/
[19:42:53] <dblosevn> dreamingrainbow: I told you earlier if it wasnt always going to be colors-10 just add a dummy class and use that as your selector
[19:43:11] <dreamingrainbow> ok that is great
[19:43:17] <dreamingrainbow> thanks for the help and lesson
[19:43:22] <dblosevn> np :-)
[19:44:40] <dblosevn> now to go find food :-P
[19:44:51] <Siecje> for javascript validation on a form. Do you not have a submit button and when you click the "submit" button check fields and then call .submit()?
[19:46:35] <dblosevn> Siecje: that didnt make too much sense but I think I get what your saying. depends on whther the validation is all client side syncronous code if so I add a submit listener to the form and selectively preventDefault on the submit event, I use deferreds if I need server intervention to validate data
[19:47:19] <Siecje> I have server validation, I just want to save a request and return trip
[19:47:42] <Siecje> I mean instead of having a type="submit" just have a button, or link and on click validate and submit the form
[19:48:19] <dblosevn> Siecje: that breaks pressing enter to submit ... bad ju ju
[19:49:10] <Siecje> right so do you put it on blur of each field? But then you can't validate the last field when they  hit enter
[19:50:17] <dblosevn> Siecje: I wouldnt do that unless thats what you need, Ill be back in 30 hungry if someone hasnt pointed you in the right direction Ill show you how to write your submit listener
[19:50:32] <Siecje> dblosevn: alright cool
[20:10:01] <MJCD> waddup folks
[20:10:14] <MJCD> does anyone know if jquery-ui will eventually leverage web-components?
[20:10:35] <MJCD> I was looking at it, and it just doesn't seem easy enough to justify existing right now
[20:10:38] <MJCD> over just jquery
[20:10:46] <MJCD> especially since the thing is huge
[20:10:46] <MJCD> lol
[20:15:09] <ericandrewlewis> anyone have a recommendation for a solid scrollspying library?
[20:15:17] <ericandrewlewis> i've looked at jquery-scrollspy and bootstrap's scrollspy
[20:16:27] <ericandrewlewis> jquery-scrollspy is limited in the fact that it only supports exactly pixel scroll offsets rather than element-relative scrolling
[20:16:54] <ericandrewlewis> bootstrap's seems to be hard-wired for navigation menus
[20:18:14] <MJCD> lol what the fuck is a scrollspy
[20:19:13] <ericandrewlewis> triggering events based on how much the user has scrolled (scrollTop)
[20:19:36] <dekiss> can you tell me some good link for article,book,video or tutorrial for learning backbone.js, require.js, underscore and amd?
[20:21:11] <ericandrewlewis> dekiss: might as well read the full instruction guide to life if you're going to cover all those topics in one place
[20:21:59] <MJCD> ericandrewlewis: seems like you could just do it yourself really if you don't like the options available
[20:22:21] * Velveeta thumbs through his copy of "Handbook For the Recently Deceased".
[20:23:11] <ericandrewlewis> MJCD: yeah, thinking i'm going to.
[20:25:43] <dekiss> aha
[20:25:48] <dekiss> ericandrewlewis ^^
[20:29:17] <MJCD> (since that does not sound complicated in the least heh)
[20:31:52] <dreamingrainbow> Any help would be appreciated.. how could i simplify the jquery in to a function in this http://jsfiddle.net/4z8sA/8/
[20:35:11] <dreamingrainbow> what i have there works, but i know it coud be written in less since i am just changing the class for each option set. I have like 4-5 option sets on a page and just dont wanna copy those five lines and create another half dozen fake classes.
[20:36:15] <MJCD> dreamingrainbow: lol yeah I mean
[20:36:27] <dreamingrainbow> lmao
[20:36:28] <MJCD> just put all your element id's in an array and forEach it
[20:36:44] <MJCD> or else use an integer if your id's all take that format
[20:36:46] <MJCD> and just increment
[20:37:00] <MJCD> (array much more flexible but still requires you to specify all id's
[20:37:30] <MJCD> removing a class and then adding an identical class seems strange though
[20:37:30] <MJCD> lol
[20:37:38] <dreamingrainbow> i was hoping to put an onclick function that knows the option group and does what i want.
[20:37:58] <Velveeta> you could attach the option group as a data attribute
[20:38:04] <dreamingrainbow> it removes them from the whole group.
[20:38:18] <dreamingrainbow> lol nice idea
[20:38:29] <dreamingrainbow> thanks Veleeta
[20:38:40] <dreamingrainbow> VelVeeta*
[20:38:57] <Velveeta> no problem, i'm converting it into a PoC now
[20:39:47] <MJCD> data- attributes seem kind of stupid to me
[20:39:56] <kandinski> hi, just so I'm sure I understand, jquery.extend() does not mutate its first argument, but rather return a new merged object. Correct?
[20:39:57] <MJCD> or at least not really as helpful as everyone makes them out to be
[20:40:16] <MJCD> since we're in JS anyway, and that DOM nodes are just objects that you can write whatever you want to anyway, realistically
[20:40:48] <Velveeta> dreamingrainbow: something ilke this: http://jsfiddle.net/4z8sA/9/
[20:40:56] <MJCD> kandinski: er, no
[20:41:03] <MJCD> they will all be put into the first object
[20:41:14] <kandinski> hmm
[20:41:19] <kandinski> bugger
[20:41:32] <MJCD> you could do .extend({}, Object1, Object2) to achieve that
[20:41:37] <Velveeta> right
[20:41:50] <kandinski> MJCD, right. So you get a returned object in any case.
[20:42:21] <kandinski> I'm trying to understand this jquery plugin, and it seems to me that the options (a jquery.settings object) are getting mutated right and left
[20:42:21] <dreamingrainbow> Velveeta that doesnt work. But I have an idea am working on
[20:43:53] <Velveeta> dreamingrainbow: oh yeah, i forgot to include the dot part of the selector string
[20:43:57] <Velveeta> but you get the idea
[20:44:00] <MJCD> yeah
[20:44:06] <MJCD> or alternatively you can use a css class ;o
[20:44:09] <yellowfish> does anyone have experience with Gmaill css on Android?
[20:44:11] <dreamingrainbow> http://jsfiddle.net/4z8sA/12/
[20:44:26] <dreamingrainbow> was what i was trying to do
[20:44:43] <kandinski> MJCD, and does the first object get created if it doesn't exist?
[20:45:10] <Velveeta> dreamingrainbow: i don't think 'this' in the context you're using it in is what you're intending it to be
[20:45:29] <dreamingrainbow> no that didnt work
[20:45:32] <dreamingrainbow> i was trying
[20:45:38] <MJCD> kandinski: since it accepts a range of arguments (argumentsN) then there's always going to be a 'first'
[20:45:38] <dreamingrainbow> I am a noob at this totally
[20:45:47] <MJCD> which is why in the example above I fed in a blank object
[20:46:26] <kandinski> yep, I'm looking at the documentation
[20:46:35] <kandinski> MJCD, thanks
[20:46:59] <MJCD> np :)
[20:54:31] <dblosevn> dreamingrainbow: and once again :-) http://jsfiddle.net/Snfch/

[20:55:26] <dblosevn> dekiss: anything you want it to be :-)
[20:55:45] <MJCD> I just hope more vars are needlessly started with $ personally
[20:55:51] <MJCD> Because this is ##php
[20:55:54] <dreamingrainbow> dblosevn its not working?
[20:55:56] <MJCD> :3
[20:56:03] <dblosevn> dreamingrainbow: works great
[20:56:04] <dekiss> hm
[20:56:06] <dekiss> lol
[20:56:12] <dekiss> ok
[20:56:15] <dblosevn> theres 4 groups one listener
[20:56:25] <dekiss> in backbone what is $el ? dblosevn <<
[20:56:27] <dblosevn> I usually use $ before vars to indicate its a jquery object
[20:57:10] <MJCD> this channel does seem very related to backbone.
[20:57:10] <dekiss> waht is this this.$el
[20:57:24] <MJCD> dekiss: can you help me fix my LC2200?
[20:57:28] <dblosevn> dekiss: depends on the context
[20:57:36] <MJCD> Oh wait, you mean this isn't ##electronics and I should ask in the relevant channel?
[20:57:38] <MJCD> Weird.
[20:57:49] <dreamingrainbow> http://jsfiddle.net/Snfch/ doesnt let me select any.
[20:58:10] <dblosevn> dreamingrainbow: your browsers broke then Im selecting one from each group
[20:58:19] <MJCD> dreamingrainbow: seems very buggy to me too
[20:58:29] <MJCD> but dblosevn seems very confident, and that's all that matters!
[20:58:47] <dekiss> ah nvm
[20:58:48] <dekiss> thanks
[20:58:49] <dblosevn> oh, guess you cant click the radio button itself
[20:59:07] <dblosevn> MJCD: your in a jolly modd today :-)

[21:05:32] <dreamingrainbow> http://jsfiddle.net/Snfch/2/ got it
[21:05:47] <dreamingrainbow> thanks man I couldnt have done it with out you
[21:06:44] <dreamingrainbow> i found the bug.. it was an improper formated string so i fixed it
[21:09:24] <dblosevn> dreamingrainbow: the bug still persists, trying to figure out why it wont work if you click the radio
[21:10:05] <dblosevn> dreamingrainbow: sorry im a ditz, I prevented the default behavior of the radio
[21:10:14] <dreamingrainbow> http://jsfiddle.net/Snfch/4/ this is working exatly like i need it.
[21:10:28] <dblosevn> dreamingrainbow: http://jsfiddle.net/Snfch/5/
[21:11:05] <dblosevn> dreamingrainbow:  except in /4 its still preventing default and causing the radio button click to be prevented
[21:20:42] <Velveeta> dekiss: as far as the documentation is concerned on the API site, they list usage patterns as if they were function overloads
[21:21:07] <Velveeta> the first use case they list is the read version of the method, which takes no parameters, and then below that, they list the use case of supplying parameters to overwrite innerHTML
[21:22:08] <dblosevn> Velveeta: thats pretty common in the jquery api, no params read, params write
[21:22:25] <Velveeta> right
[21:25:24] <dblosevn> var checked = $(this).prop('checked');/*read*/ $(this).prop('checked', true); /*write*/ which actually is pretty useful as once you know the method your dealing with you really dont have to look at the docs for it again, you can just about always assume one less param reads a property and it doesnt bloat the api with getters/setters
[21:25:46] <Velveeta> yepyep
[21:26:37] <Velveeta> i was only making that comment to him because he said he was confused that the docs said it accepted no params, but his backbone code was trying to pass one to it
[21:26:55] <dblosevn> oh... hmm
[21:26:56] <Velveeta> so i told him they list method interfaces like function overloads
[21:26:56] <dblosevn> lol
[21:28:49] <dreamingrainbow> dblosevn i got it all working in my form, it looks awesome thanks so very much again!
[21:28:55] <dblosevn> ah, got ya :-)
[21:29:56] <dblosevn> dreamingrainbow: did you remove the preventDefault line? with that there it only works 100% of the time if you dont click the radio button itself, and glad to here it. Im praying to god the form doesnt use thoughs hideous colors though :-)
[21:31:06] <Velveeta> lol
[21:31:12] <dreamingrainbow> no it doesnt use those colors it uses an image of a check mark, and i didnt take out the preventDefault,
[21:31:31] <dreamingrainbow> i hide the actual element.
[21:31:53] <dblosevn> oh so it doesnt matter :-)
[21:32:13] <dblosevn> cant click on the input no problem
[21:32:16] <dreamingrainbow> so yup it doesnt matter cause one would never actually get to select the radio
[21:32:49] <dreamingrainbow> so it was perfect thanks to you.
[21:33:39] <dblosevn> :-)
[21:34:48] <dblosevn> im bored but feel like crap and dont feel like working :-( maybe I should play xbox one lol
[21:35:10] <dreamingrainbow> style="display: none;" on each radio hahaha
[21:35:32] <dblosevn> do they still get submitted?
[21:35:39] <dreamingrainbow> yup
[21:35:41] <dblosevn> thought display none on radio was bad ju ju
[21:35:45] <dblosevn> opacity:0
[21:35:53] <dblosevn> is what I always did
[21:36:21] <dreamingrainbow> hold on ill tell ya absolute ok
[21:40:17] <dreamingrainbow> it works just as i thought, you are disableing the view not the use.
[21:41:12] <dblosevn> in all browsers? especially chrome latest now that they are implementing that new spec for form security?
[21:41:27] <dreamingrainbow> lets check i have it.. \
[21:43:11] <dreamingrainbow> works perfect
[21:43:27] <dblosevn> dreamingrainbow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1252690/ie-hidden-radio-button-not-checked-when-the-corresponding-label-is-clicked a quick google search showed quite a few people that had the issue wiwth missing user input fields when they were hidden. Everything I have seen always just either makes the opactiy noting or moves the element out of the view via zindex or actually moving it,
[21:43:27] <dblosevn> but to each his own :-)
[21:43:46] <dreamingrainbow> aw its in the title...
[21:43:53] <dreamingrainbow> when the label is clicked..
[21:44:06] <dreamingrainbow> i dont use the label as a selectable object.
[21:44:36] <dblosevn> doesnt matter, some versions of browsers wont submit user input fields if they are hidden
[21:44:52] <dblosevn> with the exception of type=hidden
[21:45:04] <dreamingrainbow> hidden or display:none?
[21:45:20] <dblosevn> re not visible on the screen
[21:45:28] <dreamingrainbow> display:hidden vs display:none?
[21:45:38] <dblosevn> display hidden isnt even valid
[21:45:44] <dblosevn> visibility hidden
[21:46:09] <dreamingrainbow> yea thats what i was after.. anyway.. I can understand the point
[21:46:26] <dreamingrainbow> I will have to see if it works on the andriod.
[21:47:42] <dblosevn> I dont use either of thoughs options on input fields
[21:48:59] <dblosevn> anyways, time for some forza 5 :-)
[21:54:10] <dreamingrainbow> ok so i see the point is with ie... which is funny.. in every way but thanks for pointing out the issue befor I have problems
[22:31:17] <krambiorix> is it possible to chain these 2 lines? $(container).find(".container_amount span").text(total);   $(el).insertBefore($(container).find(".container_amount"));  ?
[22:50:40] <MJCD> krambiorix: lol with stuff like that it's usually just quicker to try it and see as im sure you've done by now
[22:51:44] <krambiorix> MJCD, yeah i tried but it didnt do anything :D
