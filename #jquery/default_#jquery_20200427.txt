[13:09:19] <Es0teric> if i wanted to loop through a json document to find objects whos values contain a specific word how do i do that?
[14:45:46] <makr8100> Es0teric: $(JSON.parse(myJsonFile)).each(function() { ... });
[14:46:26] <makr8100> the variable myJsonFile has to contain the contents of the file, not the URI to it, although you can ajax it in and put that in the callback from the ajax call
[14:52:35] <mu1der> howdy everyone. i was using a simple jquery form generator that makes php code, and all works well except the automated date {Date} becomes incorrect toward evening, most likely using UTC time when I need to be in the east coast; i see the line of code that I think needs changed - to specify time zone for the date - but I haven't had luck alterning. i tried asking in a php room and they
[14:52:36] <mu1der> were...unhelpful. would anyone be able to lend me a hand for a second?
[15:06:23] <RoseBus> should jquery be loaded in <head> or <body> and why?
[15:06:41] <RoseBus> i've seen it both ways
[15:07:16] <dw1> end of <body>, then your script is pro
[15:07:40] <RoseBus> i can't tell if ur being sarcastic or not xD
[15:07:42] <dw1> head or top of body is about the same. the downside is it blocks the client on initial load
[15:07:48] <dw1> it slows initial load
[15:07:57] <dw1> thats why you put it at the end of body
[15:07:59] <RoseBus> ahh okay
[15:13:13] <dw1> if inserting at the top it's just tradition really to put it in head instead of body
[15:13:31] <dw1> as long as its before other script it works the same
[15:14:29] <dw1> i dont know of any advantage to using head over body, unless perhaps you wanted to manipulate the head
[15:14:33] <dw1> and wanted it to be complete
[15:14:44] <dw1> then you might put script in body idk
[15:17:29] <dw1> seems like a dumb thing to do tho
[15:17:38] <dw1> could just set it up how you want to begin with via PHP or whatever
[15:18:02] <dw1> or later on when doc is fully loaded

[17:21:34] <dw1> someone needs a better hobby
[18:51:36] <Horacsio> hi. I have this <div class="myclass" data-row-height="300"> I need to change the data-row-height content. how to?
[19:08:51] <Horacsio> can someone help me with this code: https://pastebin.com/p3LUjgdD
[19:13:21] <pavonia> Horacsio: $("div.myclass").data("row-height", 400) should work
[19:14:20] <Horacsio> thank you pavonia. I'm trying now
[19:15:38] <Horacsio> for some reason it doesn't reset the previous value to 400 :(
[19:19:02] <Horacsio> @pavonia I have this div as you may see in the link here https://dpaste.org/Z6nD
[19:22:27] <pavonia> Seems to work fine https://jsbin.com/fucirabofi/1/edit?html,js,console,output
[19:24:20] <dw1> .data does not modify the html however internally the new value is stored and retrievable with .data in the future
[19:24:49] <dw1> https://api.jquery.com/data/
[19:25:23] <dw1> "Using the data() method to update data does not affect attributes in the DOM. To set a data-* attribute value, use attr."
[19:27:41] <dw1> "Since jQuery 1.4.3, data-* attributes are used to initialize jQuery data. An element's data-* attributes are retrieved the first time the data() method is invoked upon it, and then are no longer accessed or mutated (all values are stored internally by jQuery)."
[19:28:59] <Horacsio> @dw1 but attr works even with my data-row-height?
[19:29:32] <dw1> yeah
[19:29:49] <dw1> although reading it with .data might not work after
[19:30:02] <dw1> not sure
[19:30:16] <dw1> maybe the first time
[19:30:53] <dw1> as stated
[19:32:16] <Horacsio> it changed the value... but it doesnt' take effect on what I need
[19:34:05] <Horacsio> I mean the value for data-row-height changes but doesn't affect that attribute!
[19:37:03] <Horacsio> https://jsbin.com/cihusokoxe/1/edit results in some console errors
[19:38:37] <dw1> think you just forgot the jquery library
[19:46:15] <Horacsio> @dw1 yes: https://jsbin.com/zuzetepopa/edit?html,js,console,output
[19:48:37] <Horacsio> @dw1 but why the value doesn't output the expected result?
[19:51:58] <pavonia> What result do you expect?
[19:53:15] <Horacsio> @pavonia https://boweandpartners.com/team/ the page is now with original set to 350, but I changed it to 200.
[19:53:24] <Horacsio> and both values are the same
[19:57:19] <Horacsio> @pavonia this value refers to the height of the first row of images
[19:58:38] <pavonia> Don't know, sorry
[19:59:11] <Horacsio> ok thank you :)
[20:29:38] <Es0teric> if i wanted to grab results from a $.post() call to add to another method
[20:29:40] <Es0teric> how would i do that?
[20:29:46] <Es0teric> it would be an array of objects
[20:36:20] <dw1> what do you mean another method
[20:37:18] <dw1> $.post('/somewhere',{var:'val'},function(r){ /* some stuff with r */  });
[20:38:11] <Es0teric> dw1 i have something like this: https://kopy.io/zffHc i just want the results of the data to be pushed into funders as an array
[20:38:36] <Es0teric> well an object
[20:38:40] <Es0teric> an object of arrays
[20:38:45] <dw1> posts are asynchronous
[20:38:46] <Es0teric> i mean an array of objects
[20:39:00] <dw1> so console.log would run before the post is finished
[20:39:18] <Es0teric> so how do i make it run when the post is finished?
[20:39:25] <Es0teric> does $.post() take .done()?
[20:39:30] <dw1> put it in the result function
[20:39:33] <dw1> where you process data
[20:39:40] <Es0teric> what?
[20:41:14] <dw1> https://kopy.io/mtPj6
[20:41:23] <dw1> if you really want it global
[20:41:32] <dw1> then other functions could rad it
[20:41:35] <dw1> read*
[20:41:52] <Es0teric> hmm
[20:42:12] <Es0teric> and i could use funders.push({value,name : null });
[20:42:12] <Es0teric> right?
[20:42:23] <Es0teric> if i want to push more properties into the object
[20:43:03] <Es0teric> dw1
[20:43:24] <dw1> if you want an object instead of array
[20:44:12] <dw1> uhh
[20:44:26] <dw1> usually i would return json from a post
[20:44:36] <dw1> then do data=JSON.parse(data);
[20:44:57] <Es0teric> yeah but what if i just want to push to an object?
[20:45:00] <dw1> so i could have named vars and values
[20:45:12] <dw1> not just numeric keys
[20:45:35] <dw1> just initialize like an object var funders={};
[20:45:53] <dw1> then funders[name]='val'; will be accessible at like funders.name
[20:46:18] <dw1> well the value of name
[20:46:35] <dw1> youre mixing up arrays and objects
[20:46:37] <dw1> do you know the difference
[20:46:51] <dw1> arrays dont have key names
[20:47:21] <dw1> your funders.push({value,name : null });  would be pushing an object into an array
[20:47:41] <dw1> and thats not really how object key names usually are, with a comma
[20:47:47] <dw1> but you mean value.name i guess
[20:47:56] <Es0teric> i just want something like... let funders = {'name 1' : null, 'name 2' : null}, etc efc
[20:47:58] <Es0teric> *etc etc
[20:48:07] <Es0teric> name 1 comes from value.name
[20:48:45] <dw1> https://kopy.io/VhCAn
[20:50:15] <dw1> that makes a global accessible later outside the ajax request
[20:50:42] <Es0teric> but i just tried it and its not global accessible
[20:51:05] <Es0teric> oh nvm lol
[20:51:11] <dw1> well if you did it within a jquery ready statement its global to that statement
[20:51:21] <dw1> you'd have to define it outside that to be even more global
[20:51:26] <dw1> :)
[20:52:20] <Es0teric> hmm
[20:52:23] <Es0teric> i see thanks man!
[20:52:27] <dw1> np
[20:56:57] <Es0teric> dw1 https://kopy.io/WcxT7#line-12
[20:57:02] <Es0teric> thats not making it available
[20:59:05] <dw1> .post is asynchronous it hasnt finished yet when you make that event
[20:59:34] <dw1> do you just want to load all the autocomplete values once ?
[21:00:11] <dw1> if so just put it right in the function(data) {  function
[21:00:41] <dw1> but if you want it to repeatedly search via ajax for every autocomplete thats a different story
[21:03:38] <dw1> and i would look for examples https://www.google.com/search?q=jquery+ajax+autocomplete
[21:04:58] <dw1> i see you were just getting them all... so
[21:05:09] <Es0teric> dw1 wait what?
[21:05:43] <dw1> youd just put it right in the result processing
[21:05:43] <dw1> https://kopy.io/pCTEK
[21:05:51] <dw1> so it can work asynchronously
[21:06:30] <dw1> but if you're always using them all.. you may as well do some mysql query or whatever and build a javascript object yourself
[21:06:33] <dw1> before hte page even loads
[21:07:09] <dw1> then put it inline
[21:07:42] <dw1> let funders=<?=json_encode($funders_array)?>;
[21:07:44] <dw1> or whatever
[21:08:00] <dw1> in PHP
[21:08:52] <dw1> well using PHP in the HTML
