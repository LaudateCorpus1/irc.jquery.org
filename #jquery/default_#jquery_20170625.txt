[03:16:48] <ericP> in a $("body").keydown, is there a way to see if the focus is an input which has changed (e.g. user typed "asdf" and then hit ctl enter which was captured by the keydown)?
[03:22:16] <ericP> i tried setting the focus elsewhere and restoring it but that oddly moves the cursor if the last thing they typed was a backspace (huh?)
[11:03:56] <mariacheline> Oh alright sillyslux
[11:04:01] <sillyslux> howdi
[11:04:18] <sillyslux> jquery pros are here
[11:04:42] <mariacheline> Remember me? hahah
[11:04:47] <sillyslux> if nobody answers, you just have to wait, but it pays...
[11:04:50] <sillyslux> yes
[11:05:22] <mariacheline> Well, i'll post my question
[11:05:40] <sillyslux> just shoot :)
[11:06:21] <mariacheline> I just need a way to close the slide module when either info icon and mail icon are on close icon
[11:06:24] <mariacheline> link: https://mariacheline.github.io/with-my-own-eyes/
[11:08:37] <mariacheline> If it helps i'll send you source for js
[11:09:08] <sillyslux> i've cloned your repo the other day
[11:09:35] <mariacheline> I've recently updated the code
[11:12:47] <sillyslux> got it
[11:13:36] <mariacheline> I tried the else statement where I would checked if the class, let's say, .fa-info--clicked hasClass of fa-close but that, somehow, doesn't work
[11:14:28] <mariacheline> Cuz basically i'm replacing the fa-info or fa-envelope-o icon to fa-close icon
[11:19:35] <sillyslux> https://gist.github.com/sillyslux/e4c85cd5364b38643359fbaa451843c7/revisions
[11:20:13] <sillyslux> that's for info only, do the same for envelope
[11:20:47] <mariacheline> Alright, doing now
[11:21:12] <sillyslux> ok the slide bar pane doesn't slide away yet
[11:22:11] <ilyaigpetrov> Hi. What does this snippet means, what is `$('*',this)`? https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/gK6eJ5gl/jquery
[11:22:19] <sillyslux> also .hide misses the fading transition
[11:23:28] <sillyslux> ilyaigpetrov, the first arg is https://api.jquery.com/all-selector/
[11:24:52] <mariacheline> sillyslux, got it just have to add the removeClass statement of slide the slide module on the first if statement
[11:25:10] <sillyslux> ilyaigpetrov, 2nd parameter is described here https://api.jquery.com/all-selector/
[11:25:24] <sillyslux> ehm here... http://api.jquery.com/jquery/
[11:25:34] <sillyslux> jQuery( selector [, context ] )
[11:26:02] <sillyslux> mariacheline, great
[11:26:46] <ilyaigpetrov> sillyslux: what it may be used for? parsing html as text into DOM nodes?
[11:27:09] <sillyslux> ilyaigpetrov, Selector Context
[11:27:10] <sillyslux> By default, selectors perform their searches within the DOM starting at the document root. However, an alternate context can be given for the search by using the optional second parameter to the $() function.
[11:27:47] <sillyslux> with the 2nd parameter, you can have e.g. "*" match all elements of the given "root"
[11:27:56] * ilyaigpetrov sillyslux: yes, but it searches "All elements" in this and it is not evident why somebody may need such search
[11:28:29] <ilyaigpetrov> sillyslux: the previous part of code is: `$('*:contains("remind")')`, then comes the filter
[11:28:55] <sillyslux> e.g. $('li', $('.nav')) would return all li's from some div.nav element
[11:29:32] <sillyslux> http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[11:30:10] <mariacheline> sillyslux, why didn't you put semicolon on return
[11:30:10] <ilyaigpetrov> sillyslux: I understand the parts you reference, I don't understand what this `filter` does
[11:30:42] <sillyslux> mariacheline, it's best practice to use semicolons, yes
[11:31:12] <sillyslux> with eslint airbnb rules i got lazy
[11:31:30] <mariacheline> lol
[11:31:47] <mariacheline> thanks, it works perfectly now D:
[11:31:48] <sillyslux> ilyaigpetrov, you mean the :contains filter?
[11:32:00] <mariacheline> Syncing on github
[11:32:07] <sillyslux> kewl
[11:32:08] <mariacheline> to
[11:32:11] * ilyaigpetrov sillyslux: no, `filter(...)` in the code above
[11:32:50] <ilyaigpetrov> here: https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/gK6eJ5gl/jquery
[11:33:12] <sillyslux> ah i see
[11:33:44] <sillyslux> is that .filter on an jquery object or an ordinary js-array?
[11:34:12] <ilyaigpetrov> sillyslux: on the result of :contains jquery selector
[11:35:10] <ilyaigpetrov> sillyslux: I think it filters elements that don't contains any children
[11:35:54] <sillyslux> ok then, :contains selector will return all matched elements with plain text "remind" somewhere inside, so that is kind of an filtered element list
[11:36:18] <sillyslux> running .filter on that does remove some elements from that array
[11:36:53] <sillyslux> namely, if the callback you provide to the filter function returns true, that element is kept, otherwise it'll be removed
[11:37:20] <ilyaigpetrov> sillyslux: I'm ok with javascript, I just haven't used jquery for years
[11:37:32] <sillyslux> that particular filter function will remove empty elements
[11:37:42] <sillyslux> oh ic
[11:37:52] <ilyaigpetrov> sillyslux: it will leave elements without child nodes...
[11:37:56] <ilyaigpetrov> I guess
[11:38:10] <ilyaigpetrov> s/=/===
[11:38:21] <sillyslux> yea, but.... .length=0
[11:38:31] <sillyslux> yea ===
[11:38:45] <ilyaigpetrov> sillyslux: ok, thank you for your support
[11:42:35] <mariacheline> Thank you sillyslux!
[11:43:02] <mariacheline> Gotta go, bye :)
[11:43:20] <sillyslux> bye
[14:16:51] <YourMCGeek> Hi I was wondering if anyone had a example of GET and POST. They are giving me troubles
[14:24:02] <pavonia> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/#entry-examples
[16:10:21] <YourMCGeek> Would someone be willing to assist me with a GET / POST problem. I've read the API docs but for me it's not making sense.
[16:12:57] <Woet> YourMCGeek: why dont you just ask your question?
[16:14:03] <YourMCGeek> Alrighty Woet.
[16:16:22] <YourMCGeek> So, when I click a button, I want to use that function to get the value of a text box, then use POST (I think) to use http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/GetPlayerSummaries/v0002/key&steamids=. After that = the value of the text box goes there. That URL will have a JSON that I want to pull the object "avatarfull" to get the URL of the avatar and make it a img src
[16:18:03] <YourMCGeek> I know its a lot Woet
[16:33:34] <YourMCGeek> Anyone..?
[20:12:18] <HumanPubSub> Hello, I was wondering if this is a good idea to use pubsub in my code? I have many event listeners that some of them call multiple functions. Is there any benefit to use pubsub?
