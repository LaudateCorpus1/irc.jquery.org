[00:31:12] <Faralla> Hi. I tried adding data-filter="true" to a listview, but it does not works. That is, when I try to enter text, it is not showing in the search input. nothing happens at all. Do I need to add anything besides the data-filter="true" tag?
[00:31:57] <Faralla> Also, the list is generated automatically. maybe I need to refresh the search-input in any way?
[00:46:46] <liam> hi does anyone know of an example of jquery full calendar that uses the drag to create events?
[00:49:57] <le_gars> Hi all
[00:50:15] <le_gars> A question about retrieving data from a data attribute
[00:50:39] <le_gars> I thought I was able to get it by doing .data()
[00:50:59] <BinaryKitten> le_gars you can
[00:51:10] <le_gars> I can in web inspector but when I try it out in my app it justs alerts object object
[00:51:11] <jdo_dk> le_gars: U should be able to that.
[00:51:14] <BinaryKitten> but using .data won't update it
[00:51:50] <le_gars> BinaryKitten: how do you mean
[00:51:59] <le_gars> wont update it?
[00:52:40] <BinaryKitten> le_gars var item = $('#item'); console.log(item.data('link')); /* outputs content of data-link, or if not avail from jQuery data store */
[00:53:12] <BinaryKitten> item.data('link', 'some_other_data'); /* update made to jquery data store, not attribute. */
[00:53:38] <BinaryKitten> also i think that the data store takes precidence over the attribute
[00:53:46] <le_gars> Ok, I'm on jquery 1.4.4 I might add
[00:54:22] <Trisox> le_gars: what your trying to retrieve?
[00:55:06] <le_gars> Ok quick example. On client side I try to retrieve it like this: var some = $('a[data-decline]'); alert(some).data('decline');
[00:55:09] <le_gars> for example
[00:55:15] <BinaryKitten> le_gars does .attr('data-decline') work?
[00:55:29] <BinaryKitten> le_gars there's the issue with the alert
[00:55:35] <le_gars> I thought so
[00:55:37] <BinaryKitten> you're alerting the some   not the data
[00:55:43] <Trisox> haha alert yea
[00:55:49] <le_gars> I know
[00:55:50] <Trisox> use console.log
[00:55:57] <le_gars> √èt's not me who wants the alert thete
[00:56:00] <le_gars> :(
[00:56:03] <le_gars> have to have it
[00:56:09] <BinaryKitten> if you alert on (some).data
[00:56:10] <le_gars> there no work around
[00:56:12] <BinaryKitten> it will fail
[00:56:18] <Trisox> then convert it to a string or something
[00:56:29] <BinaryKitten> if you alert(some.data('decline')) then you'll get it
[00:56:40] <BinaryKitten> your braces are wrong le_gars
[00:56:52] <BinaryKitten> braces/parentheses
[00:56:55] <le_gars> ok Ill try thx
[00:57:07] <le_gars> where?
[00:57:09] <Trisox> ah :D indeed  alert(some).data('decline'); :p
[00:57:20] <BinaryKitten> alert(some) will alert the some object, thus giving you object object
[00:57:24] <Trisox> that dont work ;) wrap it in alert( here )
[00:58:01] <BinaryKitten> alert(some.data('decline')) will grab the data from some and alert that
[00:58:23] <le_gars> alert(some).data('declined') still gives me object object
[00:58:30] <BinaryKitten> yes
[00:58:37] <BinaryKitten> because you still have the brackets wrong
[00:58:47] <BinaryKitten> not alert(some).data
[00:58:51] <le_gars> now I see
[00:58:56] <BinaryKitten> alert(some.data.....
[00:58:57] <BinaryKitten> :)
[00:58:59] <le_gars> ah my god im blind thx
[00:59:01] <le_gars> :)
[00:59:04] <BinaryKitten> np
[00:59:15] <BinaryKitten> right time for me to head off
[00:59:59] <le_gars> cheers guys
[01:00:12] <le_gars> u made me feel like a complete noob...:D
[01:01:39] <BinaryKitten> le_gars unfortunately so, not intentional. Next time we'll try better and aim for adding "utter" in there somewhere
[01:01:42] <Trisox> BinaryKitten: have a nice one ;)
[01:01:53] <BinaryKitten> :p
[01:02:00] <Trisox> what time is it over there
[01:02:22] <le_gars> hahah
[01:02:39] <BinaryKitten> 09:02am Trisox
[01:03:02] <dblosevn> 4:02 am :-)
[01:03:16] <Trisox> 10:03   / 24:00
[01:03:25] <Trisox> uk ;-) ahh
[01:03:27] <BinaryKitten> Trisox aka "must leave for the office otherwise i'll be in trouble again" time
[01:03:43] <Trisox> oke ;-)  good luck!
[01:09:48] <Guest678> hello
[01:17:00] <Pitel_IPEX> which is better/faster? $(selector, xmldata) or $(xmldata).find(selector)?
[01:19:17] <NodeX> pretty much optimised to be the same
[01:26:43] <Faralla> Sorry, was offline. Anybody has an answer to my data-filter question?
[01:30:53] <brantje> [10:19:09] <NodeX> pretty much optimised to be the same
[01:32:41] <Faralla> brantje: thx. But I don't get it
[01:37:36] <dblosevn> grrrrr
[01:39:45] <litenull> guys, i have a question. i have a big array of dom elements and i have to check them all to select only the elements that are at a certain position. what is the fastest way to do that ? jQuery.filter is relatively slow
[01:41:50] <brantje> litenull have ou tryed $.each(array,funtion(index){ })
[01:42:47] <litenull> yes, i have tried the standard for loop too. it works fine on browser, but on a samsung galaxy s3 it takes 1,2 secs
[01:43:39] <litenull> is there some fancy parallel way to iterate ? :))
[01:44:05] <brantje> I tough each was the fastest way
[01:44:40] <Cork> litenull: position in relation to what?
[01:45:13] <Trisox> each is slow
[01:45:16] <Trisox> use fo
[01:45:17] <Trisox> r
[01:45:20] <Trisox> hey Cork
[01:45:23] <litenull> Cork: i have several tds that share the same position()['left'] value
[01:45:24] <Cork> o/
[01:45:31] <Trisox> o/
[01:45:47] <Cork> litenull: if possible add a class to those elements instead
[01:45:58] <litenull> good idea
[01:46:03] <Cork> or if they have the same position in the different tr's thats an option too
[01:46:08] <Cork> but doing position() is slow
[01:46:18] <Cork> and is prob what causes your problem
[01:46:40] <litenull> i could set some values with attr() on dom load on tds
[01:46:48] <litenull> and then get them in the loop ?
[01:46:56] <Cork> i would use .data instead
[01:47:05] <Cork> unless you need it in the actual dom
[01:47:05] <litenull> ok
[01:47:16] <NielsNL> Hello all, using the datepicker together with the altfield now it looks like that when i'm clearing the date field the altfield is not cleared as well. is there some work around?
[01:47:19] <litenull> no, i'll use your option
[01:47:21] <Cork> but if its position in the tr you can filter based on that
[01:47:30] <Cork> but a class if you can do that is the absolutely best
[01:47:38] <Cork> that will always be really fast
[01:47:43] <Cork> and you won't need to loop at all
[01:48:01] <Cork> the native selectAll will be able to do it
[01:48:21] <brantje> stupid reziablr boxes
[01:48:33] <brantje> put 3 next to each other
[01:48:36] <litenull> Cork: i cant rely on the table structure, because its not formed well. so i must use position. i'll use that options :)
[01:48:37] <brantje> resize one
[01:48:39] <litenull> Cork: thanks
[01:48:40] <Cork> litenull: if you want to get as much speed as possible try to make sure you have to do as little job as possible in js
[01:48:44] <brantje> and you see the problem
[01:48:48] <Cork> push into native dom selectors
[01:48:58] <litenull> Cork: will do
[01:49:35] <Trisox> litenull: cant you do the selection serversided ?
[01:49:49] <Trisox> and then put a class on it like Cork sugested it
[01:50:18] <Cork> ya, categorizing the columns is really the best solution
[01:50:19] <Trisox> litenull: how big is the table?
[01:50:40] <Trisox> i mean resizing the table to smaller peices might help also
[01:50:52] <Trisox> depends on the function of the table
[01:51:06] <NielsNL> Here is some code i use: for the datepicker: http://jsfiddle.net/usLyN/
[01:51:29] <Trisox> bit ass table on phones are prob not that user friendly any how
[01:53:05] <Cork> tables are slow on what ever device you are
[01:53:19] <Cork> just from the fact of all its complex rules the browser have to use for it
[01:53:40] <litenull> wait a sec so i can read the conversation
[01:55:00] <litenull> the basic problem is i must use a user exported html and then make it pretty etc. i will do the selection server sided and label the classes
[01:55:23] <litenull> the table is 196 tds
[01:56:03] <Cork> how many rows?
[01:56:50] <litenull> 17 rows
[01:57:41] <Cork> ouch >_>
[01:57:46] <litenull> on chrome it takes 60ms to select the elements
[01:57:57] <litenull> on samsung 1 sec
[01:57:59] <litenull> :/
[01:58:11] <Cork> hah no wait thats only ~11 td per row
[01:58:31] <litenull> yes, its actually a crossword
[01:58:31] <litenull> :D
[01:58:45] <Cork> litenull: ya, but mobiles does a lot of trickery around the position of elements
[01:59:37] <litenull> does the resizing of the dom change the element position ?
[01:59:41] <litenull> zoom, pinch, etc
[02:00:06] <Trisox> good question ;)
[02:00:17] <Cork> well a mobile has two viewports
[02:00:29] <Trisox> Cork: thats true
[02:00:41] <Cork> one that is the actual viewport (current zoom level and where you are)
[02:01:04] <Trisox> i think zoom doenst change your position
[02:01:10] <Cork> and then its the html viewport, the one that the browser uses to find where to wrap things and so on
[02:01:18] <litenull> ok
[02:01:21] <litenull> i hope
[02:01:21] <Trisox> landscape portait mode does
[02:01:22] <litenull> :)
[02:01:33] <Cork> no but it becomes a bit tricky for the browser to calculate sometimes
[02:01:49] <Cork> like if you have position: fixed; what viewport should it calculate against?
[02:01:59] <litenull> that's no problem, i'll change the values when the portrait or landscap
[02:02:01] <Trisox> dont use fixed ;)
[02:02:08] <Cork> so the code for position becomes slow cause of all the things it needs to take into account
[02:02:43] <litenull> its reallly slow
[02:02:48] <Cork> and position() have to loop through the parent chain of each element to calculate each parents position and then sum them together
[02:03:02] <Cork> so you do a lot of dom traversal
[02:03:10] <litenull> :/
[02:03:35] <Cork> so it really just isn't a good thing to have as a source for filtering
[02:03:39] <Trisox> wy not do something like this
[02:03:39] <Trisox> http://css-tricks.com/examples/ResponsiveTables/responsive.php
[02:03:53] <Trisox> resize your browser
[02:04:15] <Trisox> or isnt that an option
[02:04:20] <litenull> its the actual rowspan, colspan that makes the problem. i cant select the column if there are some spans. so i must use position
[02:04:29] <litenull> let me see
[02:06:00] <ItsJustMe> hey guys
[02:06:01] <litenull> what i'm actually doing, is im binding clicks on tds and then coloring the whole column if the user clicks.
[02:07:47] <ItsJustMe> May someone help me out with the elRTE wysiwyg? Its comments crash the layout ._.
[02:09:30] <Trisox> ah
[02:10:12] <Cork> litenull: and the original have no information what so ever on the td's ?
[02:10:48] <litenull> Cork: explain. like IDs, etc ?
[02:11:11] <Trisox> then you can add classes serversided ;)
[02:11:15] <Cork> litenull: like id's classes, attributes, what so ever
[02:11:26] <litenull> nope, plain table
[02:11:27] <litenull> :)
[02:11:40] <Cork> that sucks
[02:11:54] <litenull> i'm trying to implement your idea
[02:12:11] <litenull> binding to data('position_left')
[02:12:16] <litenull> the positions
[02:12:29] <litenull> and then getting in the iteration
[02:12:32] <litenull> we'll see
[02:13:25] <litenull> i mean, if it takes 1 sec on dom load, no problem, i make a loading and thats it
[02:15:05] <Trisox> i'd say awesome possum :D
[02:16:40] <litenull> :D
[02:20:06] <Cork> litenull: have you checked if you could use prop('left') ?
[02:20:17] <litenull> no, sec
[02:20:20] <Cork> that might be faster; not sure though
[02:20:59] <Cork> bah, no hmm its not exposed there
[02:21:05] <litenull> nope
[02:21:13] <Trisox> prop was not there in his jquery version i think
[02:21:48] <Cork> litenull: .prop('offsetLeft')
[02:22:05] <Trisox> litenull: your where using 1.6.4 or an other version
[02:22:22] <Cork> tecknically that should be faster then prosition(), and would make data pointless
[02:22:23] <litenull> im using 1.9 actually
[02:22:27] <Trisox> oh oke :)
[02:22:44] <litenull> just a sec, too many ideas :))
[02:23:39] <Trisox> Cork: wy prop ? i'd use data-roll="something"  and attr('data-roll','something')
[02:24:05] <Cork> Trisox: .prop('offsetLeft') == [0].offsetLeft
[02:24:12] <Cork> its a direct dom access wrapper
[02:24:20] <Trisox> oh didnt know that
[02:24:34] <Cork> thats not 100% true
[02:24:44] <Cork> but for the props that are on the dom its true
[02:24:45] <Cork> :)
[02:25:05] <Cork> and as that doesn't do any dom traversal it should be faster
[02:26:08] <Trisox> how about :nth-child(1)
[02:26:25] <Cork> if you only run it on modern browsers sure
[02:26:33] <Cork> but ie will cry over those
[02:26:36] <litenull> no go, my table is not formed as a regular table
[02:26:41] <Trisox> mobile is pretty modern
[02:26:53] <Cork> Trisox: have you actually tested that?
[02:27:03] <Trisox> no but just an idea ;)
[02:27:12] <Cork> sadly those browsers are so broken when it comes to standard things that you wouldn't know
[02:27:22] <Trisox> hmm
[02:27:25] <litenull> its usable in a regular table, but i have several colspan, and that alters the selection
[02:27:41] <Cork> they work very well if you want to do 3d animations or transitions or gradients
[02:27:53] <Cork> but many of the basic css 2.1 things are totally borked
[02:28:10] <Trisox> i mean click find the :nth-child then use it to select column
[02:28:26] <Trisox> something like that
[02:28:35] <Cork> Trisox: if you use :<selector> in jquery you get a selection in js
[02:28:41] <Cork> selectAll doens't support it
[02:28:56] <Trisox> hmm
[02:29:33] <Cork> and i suspect that the problem is that black "blocks" in the crossword are made through colspan/rowspan
[02:29:40] <litenull> Trisox: i have tried that. but if I have several colspans, the selection is something there, something there, not the column
[02:29:43] <Cork> and then you can't use dom to do selection
[02:29:54] <litenull> Cork: there are images in the crossword, they use about 3 columns
[02:30:00] <Trisox> litenull: i see
[02:33:24] <Trisox> litenull: that makes it real hard then
[02:33:43] <litenull> the .prop('offsetLeft') works, lets see performance
[02:34:08] <Trisox> got a jsfiddle for it love to see how you did that
[02:34:10] <litenull> wooooow
[02:34:19] <litenull> from 60ms to 22ms
[02:34:21] <litenull> :))))
[02:34:27] <brantje> Nice
[02:34:35] <Trisox> lol thats big diference
[02:34:36] <litenull> lets try mobile
[02:35:53] <litenull> it takes about 1 sec, but i think there's another problem there
[02:36:07] <litenull> it actually 500ms
[02:36:26] <litenull> lets try data('offset')
[02:36:31] <brantje> litenull
[02:36:36] <litenull> yes
[02:36:43] <brantje> i have here an Asus Transformer and a Desire HD
[02:36:44] <xxx> can anyone check my fiddle.http://jsfiddle.net/68gFS/2/. i cudn't adjust them properly.
[02:36:49] <brantje> So if you want... i can test
[02:37:56] <litenull> i would give my example out, but there are some api connections to some private servers.. i'll make a jsfiddle just when i'll have some time
[02:38:37] <Trisox> xxx plz fix your html first
[02:39:24] <Cork> Trisox: the html is most likely from a third party
[02:39:36] <Cork> and thats prob why he has so little control over it
[02:39:44] <Cork> i've been there a few years back
[02:39:50] <Trisox> hmm
[02:40:23] <Cork> had to actually parse the html server side (in php) convert it to dom, error correct move things around and then serialize it before sending it :/
[02:40:28] <Cork> it was... a PAIN
[02:40:44] <Trisox> no rest service?
[02:40:45] <litenull> Cork: for example, im using adobe indesign output :)))
[02:40:57] <dblosevn> php tidy then dom doc and rebuild the html the way you want it
[02:40:57] <Cork> and the customer contacted us everything something broke, and it was almost always the html beeing broken on the service provider end
[02:41:12] <Cork> dblosevn: exactly
[02:41:29] <Cork> litenull: uh... so you generate it your self?
[02:41:33] <xxx>  i am trying do exactly like this http://www.sjrgroup.com/projects
[02:41:36] <Cork> then that argument goes out the window
[02:41:40] <dblosevn> or if its simple enough a few quick regexes and bam theres your sign
[02:42:07] <Cork> LOL xxx was actually a nick, totally missed his question >_>
[02:42:19] <Cork> *ehum* carry on ;P
[02:42:20] <dblosevn> probally 80% of my projects are screen scrapes
[02:42:49] <Trisox> thank god mine aint
[02:42:59] <Cork> ya, same here
[02:43:06] <Cork> this was 5 years back though
[02:43:09] <dblosevn> ive got a massive scrape i run monthly, steam community, xbox live, psn 8 to 10 million requests in 6 days every month
[02:43:17] <Trisox> then again you shouldnt use js for re-formating html
[02:43:25] <xxx> @cork: dint understand u
[02:43:54] <Cork> xxx: na, it wasn't really a comment for you
[02:44:04] <dblosevn> got 5 power horse of servers crawling and a hex core with 32gb of ram running the db
[02:44:11] <Cork> xxx: you should change the doctype though
[02:44:23] <litenull> Cork: yes, im generating it
[02:44:34] <litenull> Cork: the $(el).data is working faster
[02:44:39] <Cork> xxx: xhtml should only be used if you plan to actually send xhtml in the near future
[02:44:40] <litenull> its 19ms
[02:44:48] <litenull> from 60ms to 19
[02:44:56] <Trisox> who thats huge win
[02:45:03] <Cork> litenull: ya, it only access a javascript object
[02:45:09] <Cork> so it doesn't even touch the dom
[02:45:10] <dblosevn> ya 1/3 nice
[02:45:19] <litenull> i think the addClass is working slow on mobile
[02:45:28] <litenull> im adding a class to the tds
[02:45:33] <Cork> no that shouldn't be slow
[02:45:39] <dblosevn> is there a profiler for mobile
[02:45:41] <gurde> if using 1.9.0 i must replace .attr() calls with .prop() calls?
[02:45:57] <Cork> gurde: depending on what you want to access
[02:46:00] <Trisox> ?attr
[02:46:00] <b-ot> Trisox: used for setting attributes on the HTML tag
[02:46:01] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[02:46:03] <Trisox> ?prop
[02:46:04] <bot-t> .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[02:46:04] <Cork> gurde: both prop and attr exists
[02:46:09] <dblosevn> ive got a pretty heavy mobile app coming up im going to have to optimize the crap out of
[02:46:09] <Cork> but they are for different things
[02:46:21] <litenull> is there a difference if I iterate and addclass or do the whole thing ?
[02:46:26] <Trisox> dblosevn: i had a carousel on ipad
[02:46:29] <Trisox> and ie8
[02:46:34] <Cork> litenull: what do you mean?
[02:46:39] <Trisox> still doesnt preform
[02:46:42] <gurde> yes, but is not clear from migration guide if it is deprecated or not, the .attr()
[02:46:49] <Cork> run addClass on a selection of element instead of one at a time?
[02:46:50] <Trisox> ie8 sucks with js animation :p
[02:46:59] <Trisox> new browsers use css3
[02:47:01] <Cork> gurde: no attr isn't depricated
[02:47:07] <litenull> each($(el).addClass) or $(array).addClass
[02:47:19] <Cork> gurde: in 1.6 attr was split up into prop and attr
[02:47:36] <xxx> @cork: creating a layout in right column  using  tables .is it a best choice ?
[02:47:38] <Cork> gurde: before 1.6 attr fetched BOTH properties and attributes

[02:48:03] <Cork> gurde: after 1.6 attr only grabs attributes, and prop only grabs properties
[02:48:18] <litenull> Cork: each($(el).addClass) or $(array).addClass which is faster ?
[02:48:35] <gurde> Cork: i see
[02:48:36] <Cork> litenull: the later would be a little faster
[02:48:50] <litenull> ok so im doing it right
[02:49:09] <litenull> i should get a profiler for mobile and check which function is doing slow
[02:49:09] <Cork> xxx: replace the doctype with <!doctype html>
[02:49:24] <Cork> xxx: as your NOT sending xhtml no reason to use that doctype
[02:52:42] <dblosevn> im wondering how a 3d model would perform on an iphone
[02:53:41] <Cork> last i checked not too poorly
[02:54:04] <dblosevn> based on jquery?
[02:54:37] <dblosevn> its smooth as butter on the ipad2
[02:56:12] <computer2000> i have multiple animations with various durations triggered at the same time, how can i execute a function as soon as all animations have finished? i cant use animations callbacks cause i dont know which one will be finished as last one...
[02:56:25] <Cork> dblosevn: depends on if you use css 3d or not
[02:56:38] <Cork> dblosevn: as long as you can keep it hw accelerated it should work well
[02:56:45] <dblosevn> no its all jquery and images
[02:56:52] <Trisox> beh have to give a presentation in 2 hours
[02:56:54] <dblosevn> not much css
[02:57:01] <Cork> dblosevn: then it will be slow
[02:57:09] <Cork> as it would not be hw accelerated
[02:57:46] <Trisox> translateZ(0); did help with my carousel on ipad
[02:58:06] <Cork> computer2000: deferred and the $.when should be able to help you there
[02:58:10] <Trisox> wat more fluent
[03:00:12] <Palanivel> How to set/get input text field values from iframe page
[03:00:15] <Palanivel> ???
[03:00:31] <Palanivel> Can any one will give idea about this?
[03:00:32] <Cork> Palanivel: is the iframe from the same domain?
[03:00:54] <Palanivel> yeap...!!!
[03:01:17] <Cork> $('iframe selector').contents().find('textarea selector').val()
[03:01:41] <Palanivel> i have 2 html page ....1. static html page 2. popup html page which is invoking via iframe
[03:02:48] <dblosevn> im not good enough with the math i dont think to try to rewrite these
[03:03:23] <dblosevn> i cleaned the code up a little bit when i built them but the majority of it is the orginal devs code
[03:03:45] <Palanivel> @cork.... OOHhh thank you man
[03:05:03] <dblosevn> http://tinyurl.com/b8okewu I dont think I could figure out the math for the motion tweens
[03:09:31] <Trisox> dblosevn: looks very nice
[03:09:57] <dblosevn> seems i have some issues with some of the videos there too big for the overlays
[03:10:05] <Trisox> hmm
[03:10:15] <dblosevn> ill fix em later
[03:10:31] <dblosevn> theres 3 different sizes of these
[03:10:55] <litenull> dblosevn: very nice
[03:11:01] <dblosevn> i never really tested the overlays on the small ones
[03:11:28] <Trisox> like that reel look rotating and stuff
[03:12:02] <dblosevn> ya it is way smooth for 10 degree images
[03:12:33] <dblosevn> the motion tweens could be a little smoother though
[03:13:36] <dblosevn> its way smoother with flash lol but dont work for mobile http://tinyurl.com/b7qqpln
[03:14:00] <Trisox> flash ieeee
[03:14:30] <Trisox> dont find it that much smoother
[03:14:40] <dblosevn> i built the mobile based on the xml from the flash
[03:15:02] <Trisox> oh nice
[03:15:08] <BouvieR> hello guyz, i have a problem with ie + jquery :(
[03:15:26] <BouvieR> someone help me?
[03:15:36] <dblosevn> the motion tween is way smoother for the hotspots on the flash version
[03:15:43] <Trisox> wrong button :D
[03:15:49] <dblosevn> ?demo @ BouvieR

[03:16:19] <Trisox> version ;)
[03:16:30] <nanovirus> Can anyone see anything wrong with this long polling function?  It is not adhering to the timeout, and is running ~ every second!
[03:16:32] <nanovirus> http://jsfiddle.net/fnNxY/
[03:17:24] <BouvieR> dblosevn: i`m using a file json, but i need convert json charset default utf-8 in ISO
[03:17:30] <BouvieR> i used beforeSend
[03:17:43] <dblosevn> nanovirus: um... your script probally completes in about a second
[03:17:48] <BouvieR> work in others navigators.. but in ie have a Bug, dont convert to iso..
[03:18:14] <dblosevn> nanovirus: you must not understand what timeout means... that means it will abort the request after 30 seconds not to wait 30 seconds before polling again
[03:18:17] <nanovirus> dblosevn, yeah... but the timeout should stop it from running again for 30 secs?
[03:18:23] <nanovirus> oh
[03:19:33] <nanovirus> I'm trying to get my head round long-polling... this current setup seems like it would hammer the server... unless I'm missing something?
[03:20:06] <nanovirus> I'm following this guide http://techoctave.com/c7/posts/60-simple-long-polling-example-with-javascript-and-jquery
[03:20:09] <nanovirus> "Timeout: Set a timeout (in milliseconds) for the request. The timeout period starts at the point the $.ajax call is made. Here, we set the timeout to 30 seconds. This means our poll function won't get called again until both the ajax call is complete and (at-least) thirty (30) seconds have passed."
[03:20:12] <dblosevn> nanovirus http://jsfiddle.net/fnNxY/1/
[03:20:50] <dblosevn> nanovirus: oops missed a brace http://jsfiddle.net/fnNxY/2/
[03:21:22] <nanovirus> dblosevn, thank you
[03:21:27] <nanovirus> that makes sense ;)
[03:21:29] <dblosevn> np
[03:21:40] <dblosevn> i wrote it of course it makes sense lmao
[03:22:23] <dblosevn> the only thing i didnt handle for is if it timesout
[03:22:31] <dblosevn> it will quit polling
[03:24:28] <dblosevn> nanovirus: http://jsfiddle.net/fnNxY/3/ that will continue polling on timeout
[03:25:14] <gnarf> nanovirus: http://jsfiddle.net/fnNxY/4/
[03:25:20] <nanovirus> dblosevn, one thing... setTimeout ;)
[03:25:31] <dblosevn> ?
[03:25:36] <BouvieR> dblosevn: http://jsfiddle.net/hBw9T/
[03:25:51] <nanovirus> you put setTimeOut
[03:25:56] <dblosevn> setTimeOut only executes once and waits x milliseconds before running
[03:26:07] <nanovirus> which was undefined
[03:26:12] <dblosevn> oh
[03:26:13] <dblosevn> oops
[03:26:16] <nanovirus> np
[03:26:16] <dblosevn> setTimeout
[03:26:20] <nanovirus> yep
[03:26:37] <Trisox> hey gnarf o/
[03:26:45] <dblosevn> BouvieR: sec
[03:26:54] <BouvieR> ok man ty
[03:27:01] <nanovirus> thanks gnarf
[03:27:04] <gnarf> or rather... http://jsfiddle.net/fnNxY/6/ -- and jesus jsfiddle is slow as shit today
[03:27:10] <gnarf> er
[03:27:13] <gnarf>  /7/
[03:27:21] <gnarf> i guess i got /7 instead of 6
[03:27:43] <dblosevn> BouvieR: are you sending a Content-Type: application/json header with your response
[03:27:57] <BouvieR> dblosevn: yea
[03:28:02] <dblosevn> BouvieR: IE can get crabby over not recieving the header
[03:28:05] <BouvieR> this method work.. but dont work in ie
[03:28:12] <BouvieR> ;((
[03:28:18] <BouvieR> i`m need get json in iso
[03:28:18] <Armistice> Not sure if this is a jQuery issue or a css issue but in this: .css({width : 200, marginLeft : 200}); only the width will work. the marginLeft requires px for it to work?
[03:28:22] <BouvieR> because acents
[03:28:25] <dblosevn> BouvieR: being you used .json
[03:28:40] <dblosevn> ah
[03:28:51] <Trisox> http://jsdo.it/ is pretty fast
[03:28:53] <dblosevn> BouvieR: are you sending utf-8 headers
[03:29:06] <BouvieR> yeah, the dates of file have example: city: "S√£o Paulo"
[03:29:14] <BouvieR> dont recieve: √£
[03:29:20] <BouvieR> in utf-8
[03:29:29] <BouvieR> only dont work in ie
[03:29:31] <dblosevn> are you telling the browser its utf8
[03:29:34] <BouvieR> others navigators work
[03:29:55] <dblosevn> other browsers are more lax then ie
[03:30:06] <BouvieR> yeah .. kkk
[03:30:30] <BouvieR> kkk = smile in brazil =x
[03:30:51] <dblosevn> header('Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8');
[03:31:22] <BouvieR> dblosevn: utf-8 is default of file json
[03:31:30] <BouvieR> i need convert contents for is
[03:31:33] <BouvieR> iiso
[03:31:38] <BouvieR> iso**
[03:31:40] <dblosevn> duh... tell ie its utf8
[03:31:57] <dblosevn> the json parser is likely crashing
[03:31:57] <gnarf> just use one charset and stick to it
[03:32:02] <gnarf> utf8 is the way to go
[03:32:36] <gnarf> just make sure all your files are in utf8 - your html charset is set to utf8, etc
[03:32:40] <dblosevn> i just went through massive problems in all browsers with utf-8 chars
[03:33:01] <Trisox> :D haha
[03:33:02] <dblosevn> finally got it all working with some php/mysql/filesystem tweaks
[03:33:14] <BouvieR> gnarf, the file .json is utf-8 for default, i`m need convert file for iso
[03:33:17] <Trisox> yea that bad
[03:33:25] <BouvieR> jquery with ie dont convert
[03:33:26] <dblosevn> then when i thought it was all right i noticed it was echoing bom's
[03:33:32] <Trisox> understanding character encoding is hard
[03:33:36] <gnarf> BouvieR: I would suggest you use utf-8 for EVERYTHING including your HTML
[03:33:40] <Trisox> never fully understand it
[03:33:49] <gnarf> then you don't need to convert shit
[03:33:53] <gnarf> just serve UTF-8
[03:34:02] <alex88> hi guys, from since query automatically parses json string to object using $(this).data('value')?
[03:34:02] <Trisox> i do what gnarf said use utf-8 for EVERYTHING
[03:34:09] <dblosevn> i removed the boms and my chars broke but it didnt echo the boms lol
[03:34:17] <BouvieR> gnarf, you dont understand, the file have acents, example: "city" : "S√£o Paulo"
[03:34:28] <gnarf> BouvieR: you can encode that in utf-8 too
[03:34:45] <BouvieR> hum, how?
[03:34:47] <dblosevn> BouvieR: you dont understand send the utf8 header and send utf8 encoded data
[03:34:53] <gnarf> It's utf-8
[03:35:03] <dblosevn> utf8 supports all characters in all languages
[03:35:04] <gnarf> just save the json in utf-8, the charset of the page as utf-8, etc
[03:35:25] <gnarf> you'll be able to encode ÌïúÍµ¥ in utf-8 as well
[03:35:30] <gnarf> inside json
[03:35:31] <dblosevn> from single byte to multibyte even 6 byte chinese
[03:36:15] <Trisox> do it all base64 :p
[03:36:18] <gnarf> ISO is a very restrictive charset/encoding, I would suggest just switching everything into utf-8 it's more standard/supported across everything (including mysql, etc)
[03:36:18] <Trisox> j/k
[03:36:41] <bhenchod> will this check if the div exists in the page ? if (jQuery(".booking-form-duplicate-page").length > 0 {
[03:36:52] <BouvieR> but in utf-8 how i recieve dates of file, if have acents in var dont recieve correct, recieve: S?o Paulo //in file is S√£o Paulo
[03:37:04] <Trisox> jQuery(".booking-form-duplicate-page").length would work
[03:37:10] <dblosevn> you need to iconv the text to utf8
[03:37:18] <BouvieR> i used beforeSend in ajax. all navigators accept, bellow ie
[03:38:29] <dblosevn> iconv("ISO-8859-1//TRANSLIT", "UTF-8", $text)
[03:38:49] <gnarf> BouvieR: is the json file utf-8 encoded?
[03:38:51] <dblosevn> assuming you have iconv installed
[03:39:00] <dblosevn> gnarf: its iso
[03:39:16] <BouvieR> gnarf, in utf recieve: S?o Paulo
[03:39:18] <gnarf> BouvieR: what charset is your <html> document?
[03:39:21] <BouvieR> in iso: S√£o Paulo
[03:39:27] <bhenchod> i tried .length but that didn't work also http://pastebin.com/W1hZ4FiQ
[03:39:37] <dblosevn> BouvieR: $test = iconv("ISO-8859-1//TRANSLIT", "UTF-8", $text);
[03:40:07] <BouvieR> in file work
[03:40:15] <BouvieR> i`m need import
[03:40:29] <BouvieR> of json file
[03:40:32] <dblosevn> as long as your text is valid iso that will successfully encode it in utf8
[03:40:47] <dblosevn> and your chars should not be broken
[03:40:55] <gnarf> BouvieR: anyway, I would HIGHLY suggest you SWITCH EVERY BIT OF EVERYTHING, including your database(if you have one) into utf-8 from ISO
[03:41:15] <gnarf> there is a command line tool (iconv) and it's also a php function
[03:41:31] <dblosevn> i would too, only accept utf-8, only send utf8
[03:41:49] <dblosevn> convert everything php files includes everything
[03:42:15] <BouvieR> in php file work, but the files is in json
[03:42:15] <dblosevn> BouvieR: http://blog.loftdigital.com/blog/php-utf-8-cheatsheet follow this guide
[03:42:20] <BouvieR> =/
[03:43:39] <gnarf> BouvieR: as soon as you start dealing with charset problems, you really need to like step back and evaluate everything. -- The eventual conclusion will be that only utf-8 will support all international characters including alphabets you haven't even figured out how to type yet.
[03:45:51] <BouvieR> gnarf, i know, but look.. i`m importing file dates, (data.json), the data have vars with: city: "S√£o Paulo", how i use ajax i`m need convert to iso for dont change ("√£") for ("?")
[03:46:18] <gnarf> BouvieR: not using utf-8 in your development is going to be a hinderance to any international usability, and this is why I suggest that you use utf-8 across the board, from your <meta charset="utf-8">, to your .json files, to your database correlations
[03:46:19] <BouvieR> in utf is changing
[03:46:30] <dblosevn> BouvieR: I have given you the code already more then once to fix the encoding
[03:46:38] <BouvieR> yeah, in html is utf
[03:46:38] <gnarf> BouvieR: you can't just serve ISO as a UTF encoding without converting it
[03:46:42] <gnarf> hence, iconv
[03:46:59] <dblosevn> simply outputing the headers isnt enough you need to convert them
[03:47:04] <gnarf> iconv -f ISO88592 -t UTF8 < input.json > output.json
[03:47:13] <BouvieR> the program work... work.. but dont in IE
[03:47:21] <dblosevn> im done lol
[03:47:23] <BouvieR> internet explorer dont work
[03:48:04] <gnarf> BouvieR: look, we've told you the solution about 5 different ways, convert your shit to utf-8 and make sure its serving utf-8 headers, done...
[03:49:07] <ItsJustMe> http://s353541478.online.de/editor/ If you switch from editor to source (quellcode) and return to editor, elRTE adds some '-->' .. Would someone help me to fix that?
[03:49:13] <chilversc_> gnarf: though I wouldn't use meta charset in the document, should set the content-type header correctly on the server instead
[03:49:15] <ItsJustMe> I really do not get the point ._.
[03:49:33] <dblosevn> chilversc: you should do both
[03:49:39] <gnarf> chilversc_: what dblosevn said
[03:50:18] <dblosevn> for IE in particular
[03:50:19] <chilversc_> yeah, but I've seen some browsers ignore the meta and only obey the charset in the header
[03:50:29] <gnarf> BouvieR: not sure if you use apache or nginx, but you might want to set up your server to send utf-8 as well
[03:50:33] <dblosevn> and others do the opposite
[03:50:37] <gnarf> AddDefaultCharset UTF-8 for apache
[03:50:46] <gnarf> charset utf-8; for nginx
[03:51:15] <dblosevn> only use the mb functions as well
[03:51:19] <gnarf> wont make much difference for the php stuff, but plain old files (like json) will want these directives configured.
[03:51:44] <dblosevn> for flat files you should add mimetypes
[03:52:57] <gnarf> chilversc_: best practice is to do both, and make sure they are the same :)
[03:53:48] <chilversc_> gnarf: yeah, the number of times I see a html file that specifies one encoding, and the header something else
[03:54:16] <chilversc_> though the whole meta charset thing falls over if you decide to use utf-16 :)
[03:54:33] <BouvieR> gnarf, yeah.. i recieve data ok.. in all.. server its ok... but in internet explorer navigator dont recieve file converted =/
[03:55:04] <BouvieR> the jquery recieve data dont changed charset in internet explorer
[03:55:18] <BouvieR> understand?
[03:55:19] <gnarf> BouvieR: jquery doesn't do anything to manipulate charsets
[03:55:24] <gnarf> yeah, i understood you the first time
[03:55:32] <BouvieR> i`m tested in ie9
[03:55:33] <gnarf> don't serve an ISO encoded file as a utf-8
[03:55:44] <gnarf> convert the shit to utf-8, and serve it
[03:55:46] <gnarf> be safe
[03:56:01] <chilversc_> BouvieR: setting a charset doesn't convert anything, the charset is to tell the browser what format the data is already in, not what format to convert it to
[03:56:42] <gnarf> BouvieR: the other browsers are just being too smart for their own good and detect that your JSON is actually ISO, but IE9 is assuming something else most likely
[03:56:45] <gnarf> but who knows
[03:56:50] <gnarf> once the problem is charset related
[03:56:53] <gnarf> you have to fix it everywhere
[03:57:01] <gnarf> if your html says utf-8, make EVERYTHING utf-8
[03:57:06] <gnarf> there is no shorter solution
[03:57:42] <gnarf> your web server, database tables, etc should all bet set to utf-8
[03:57:59] <gnarf> your header() stuff in php should include utf-8 charset
[03:58:03] <gnarf> on everything
[03:58:05] <gnarf> etc
[03:58:09] <gnarf> do you understand?
[03:58:42] <yousaf> hi all
[03:58:57] <BouvieR> yeah
[03:58:59] <Armistice> how would you check if something is an object?
[03:59:09] <NodeX> typeof
[03:59:10] <gnarf> Armistice: any type of object?
[03:59:23] <gnarf> typeof something === "object"
[03:59:30] <Armistice> {this: "kind", of: "object"} ?
[03:59:30] <yousaf> I am using infinite scroll jquery plugin but i am having an issue loading tweet/fb buttons when posts are loaded via AJAX
[03:59:36] <yousaf> any one faced this issue before?
[03:59:56] <gnarf> Armistice: you want plain objects only? I.E. that should pass, but a jQuery() wouldn't?
[04:00:04] <gnarf> ?jQuery.isPlainObject
[04:00:05] <bot-t> jQuery.isPlainObject(object): Check to see if an object is a plain object (created using "{}" or "new Object"). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isPlainObject/
[04:00:31] <BouvieR> ty for ur patiente gnarf.. sorry for all
[04:00:41] <Armistice> that should do I thinkgnarf
[04:02:38] <dblosevn> my turn lol
[04:02:52] <dblosevn> is html_entitiy_decode mb safe?
[04:03:08] <BouvieR> gnarf, i defined header in php work, header.php?file=data.json for iso and work in ie.. ty ty =D
[04:03:09] <gnarf> ##php ?
[04:03:20] <dblosevn> i know htmlentities is not so should i assume the opposite is true
[04:03:28] <gnarf> actually dblosevn http://php.net/manual/en/function.html-entity-decode.php
[04:03:33] <gnarf> last argument is a charset
[04:03:45] <dblosevn> ya thats right
[04:04:13] <gnarf> default is utf-8
[04:04:13] <gnarf> so i assume so
[04:04:13] <gnarf> :)
[04:05:17] <dblosevn> grrr
[04:05:22] <dblosevn> breaks it
[04:05:34] <dblosevn> http://assets.catkiosk.com/
[04:07:00] <BouvieR> ty all =*
[04:08:17] <dblosevn> crap i think i know whats wrong
[04:08:49] <dblosevn> probally broken chars that were entityed when i fxed the rest of the data
[04:09:17] <jackjackw> If anybody could be so kind to take a look at some code for me, and help me out, I'd be ever so grateful. <-programmingnoob

[04:09:47] <dblosevn> all the data was utf8 stored as latin1
[04:09:53] <jackjackw> dblosevn http://jsfiddle.net/Y4Vvu/8/
[04:10:00] <jackjackw> im trying to use flickr as a CMS
[04:10:28] <dblosevn> ok, what is the issue?
[04:10:58] <jackjackw> I've got it so that on click, the inline styles get overridden and the projectdiv expands out, thumbnails are shown etc
[04:11:07] <jackjackw> what im trying to do now is use a child div called exit
[04:11:14] <jackjackw> to remove the styles
[04:11:25] <chilversc_> so that isPlainObject function would fail if I happen to add a property called nodeType to an object
[04:11:35] <jackjackw> I havn't managed to get it working and I've spent like a day trying to figure it out :<
[04:11:47] <dblosevn> whete is this child supossed to be?
[04:12:11] <gnarf> chilversc_: yes it would
[04:12:16] <jackjackw> inside the projectdiv, its a direct child, but on jsfiddle it isnt showing up unless you view html source
[04:12:16] <dblosevn> *where
[04:12:33] <jackjackw> I think because I'm constructing in a for loop
[04:12:50] <gnarf> chilversc_: I would suggest against ever using a property named "nodeType" anyway, lots of js uses that to detect nodes
[04:13:10] <jackjackw> the exit.click gets overridden and doesn't remove the class
[04:13:14] <chilversc_> yeah, its just something I hadn't previously considered
[04:15:21] * gnarf sighs - poor BouvieR, still didn't just convert his .json file to utf-8....
[04:15:43] <dblosevn> jackjackw: http://jsfiddle.net/Y4Vvu/9/
[04:16:50] <dblosevn> that what your looking for jackjackw?
[04:17:07] <jackjackw> yes
[04:17:15] <jackjackw> dblosevn where was i going wrong?
[04:17:29] <dblosevn> i dumped the idea of adding a child
[04:17:36] <dblosevn> i just toggle the class on click
[04:18:05] <jackjackw> ah, but theres thumbnails loading into this div also that are linking to colorbox
[04:18:21] <jackjackw> wouldn't this affect those?
[04:18:33] <dblosevn> oops
[04:18:35] <dblosevn> hold
[04:20:55] <xxx> do  we have any plugin for pagination in jquery? like cycle plugin ofr slideshow?
[04:21:07] <xxx> *for
[04:22:15] <jackjackw> dblosevn are you starting to see my headache? :(
[04:22:16] <dblosevn> jackjackw: http://jsfiddle.net/Y4Vvu/11/ now only the main image is the trigger
[04:22:49] <jackjackw> ah okay
[04:22:52] <dblosevn> jackjackw: nope no headaches here
[04:23:18] <jackjackw> dblosevn how would you get an overlay going in conjunction with this?
[04:23:24] <jackjackw> I don't need you to do it for me
[04:23:31] <jackjackw> but i would really appreciate a couple of pointers
[04:23:42] <jackjackw> so that if someone clicks the overlay the div removes class as well
[04:23:47] <dblosevn> this is what i changed http://pastebin.com/TNY7v2Su
[04:23:49] <jackjackw> kinda like colorbox
[04:24:09] <dblosevn> hmm
[04:24:15] <dblosevn> do you have the overlay already?
[04:24:16] <Trisox> bye !
[04:24:32] <jackjackw> well colorbox has an overlay I could just reuse I guess
[04:24:34] <jackjackw> other than that
[04:24:37] <jackjackw> was just going to use a div
[04:24:42] <jackjackw> with opacity
[04:25:29] <jackjackw> i've not come across .closest before
[04:25:31] <jackjackw> how awesome
[04:27:33] <Kingsy> if I click an element, and catch the event.. is it possible to trigger another element as though that was the one that was clicked?
[04:27:53] <AdamPDotty> like element.click()
[04:27:54] <Kingsy> i.e you can trigger the click event on an element without clicking it
[04:27:57] <Kingsy> oh.
[04:27:58] <Kingsy> lol
[04:28:53] <Kingsy> perfection..
[04:29:34] <jackjackw> thank you dblosevn
[04:30:20] <Armistice> I'm trying to detect if a range of values is strictly numeric... and if so, I'd append px to the end of the value. http://jsfiddle.net/ExV7n/ is what i've got so far. The object passed is remained unchanged... both values should be 300px
[04:30:24] <Armistice> What am I doing wrong?
[04:32:02] <gnarf> y?
[04:32:13] <gnarf> if you're using .css() or .animate() it should assume px
[04:32:20] <Armistice> margin doesn't, unfortunately.
[04:32:34] <Armistice> so I want to expand the .css function ;P
[04:32:41] <Armistice> wait let me show you a test.
[04:33:49] <gnarf> Armistice: http://cl.ly/image/0B3W2F2n172k
[04:34:39] <gnarf> Armistice: oh, if it's just a number, not a string containing a number, it works
[04:34:46] <gnarf> so like "300" is not gonna add px
[04:34:49] <gnarf> but 300 will
[04:35:40] <Armistice> oh.
[04:35:44] <Armistice> that could be why I'm having a problem then.
[04:36:10] <dblosevn> jackjackw: http://jsfiddle.net/w7V7A/1/
[04:36:14] <Armistice> because I have this: marginLeft : "-" + (settings.Width / 2)
[04:36:21] <Armistice> so it would think "-300" I would assume.
[04:36:26] <gnarf> Armistice: why not -(settings.Width/2)
[04:36:27] <gnarf> ?
[04:36:28] <gnarf> :)
[04:37:15] <gnarf> Armistice: unary minus operator (much like unary plus)
[04:37:15] <Armistice> oh nice. never seen that syntax before!
[04:37:20] <dblosevn> jackjackw: im not the best designer that could be positioned much more nicely
[04:37:40] <jackjackw> dblosevn
[04:37:48] <jackjackw> you are a gentleman, and a scholar
[04:37:48] <dblosevn> but you get the basic idea
[04:37:49] <gnarf> Armistice: or even -settings.Width/2 or settins.Width/-2 :)
[04:37:50] <jackjackw> i salute you
[04:38:07] <dblosevn> :-)
[04:39:38] <Armistice>  /-2 ? math is strange, but I guess that could also work.
[04:39:40] <chilversc_> Armistice: this seems to work, http://jsfiddle.net/ExV7n/1/
[04:40:02] <gnarf> Armistice: it's all the same -- -settings.Width/2 is prolly the most readable tho
[04:40:15] <chilversc_> Armistice: it seems that arguments[0] doesn't like being updated, that and you probably ment to use item[k] += "px" not item.k += "px"
[04:40:58] <xxx> how can i share screenshots here? is it possible?
[04:41:31] <dblosevn> xxx: any image sharing site
[04:41:43] <dblosevn> or host  it on a dev server somewhere
[04:42:40] <xxx> ohk. i tried  to od like here http://i.imgur.com/kT9jgTM.png
[04:42:47] <xxx> bt cudnt . so jst askd
[04:44:16] <xxx> @dblosevn: do u know something abt pagination ?
[04:53:24] <dblosevn> what might you want to know if i know?
[04:53:40] <wfq> hi guys
[04:56:20] <wfq> I don't usually play with javascript and jquery much so every time I have to do an ajax request  have got the same question. What do I need to check whether a response has been a success?
[04:57:21] <chilversc_> wfq: assuming the server sends correct status codes, you can just use the success & error callbacks
[04:58:08] <chilversc_> however, if the server responds with 200 OK when an error occurs, you'll need to check the server's response in the success callback, and have some way of detecting that response was an error
[05:00:02] <wfq> chilversc_ I understand what you mean. But you can see example of using success and other just using .done(function () {})
[05:00:08] <sectrix> so muss jetzt los ...
[05:00:11] <sectrix> oops
[05:00:14] <sectrix> sorry
[05:02:36] <chilversc_> wfq: .done is the new promise API, which uses the terms, done, fail and always instead of success, error, complete
[05:03:12] <chilversc_> wfq: the promise api has a few other bits, its designed to be a common API for all asynchronous requests (not just ajax)
[05:04:18] <gnarf> .done(function(response) { ... }) --- response is your response on success -- .fail would be your errors
[05:09:14] <wfq> chilversc_,gnarf. Thanks.
[05:10:57] <litenull> does jquery have tap event ? .on(tap) ?
[05:12:30] <gnarf> litenull: not by default, but there are some plugins to add them
[05:12:38] <litenull> ahh
[05:12:47] <litenull> i hate plugins :)
[05:13:32] <gnarf> http://plugins.jquery.com/event.tap/
[05:14:24] <gnarf> litenull: http://plugins.jquery.com/tap/
[05:14:31] <gnarf> litenull: check out their code and evaluate em
[05:14:35] <gnarf> one of em does what you want
[05:14:49] <litenull> thanks
[05:14:56] <litenull> love you guys :)
[05:17:01] <nFFF> whats wrong with this syntax: setTimeout($(this).+eval(animation), duration);
[05:17:46] <martisj> snakes on a plane
[05:17:59] <litenull> $(this).+ ?
[05:18:08] <sarahfrantz> Can somebody look at something in Chrome for me and possibly help me out, has to do with fancybox
[05:23:32] <Jee5us_w> Hi! Has anyone used qq uploader? I am trying to overwrite the message for type error. It's able to omnomnom the text, but not a function. Does anyone know is there even a way to run my own function when the uploader has a type error, without changing the sourcecode of qq uploader?
[05:29:08] <algizmedia> anyone here use pajinate with bootstrap?
[05:30:17] <algizmedia> the markup is different, but i see that a guy called wesnolte put in a pull request, so i shouldn't have to rewrite it
[05:30:31] <algizmedia> just need to know how to use it
[05:39:30] <otherj> guys, what kind of google search terms should i use to find a in-page gallery (not lightbox) that has thumbnails one can click to see the larger versions and autoplay? (those terms didn't find)
[05:40:37] <litenull> you mean like slideshow with zoom ?
[05:41:23] <otherj> i mean like elastislide, except with the ability to click the thumb to open the larger version and autoplay
[05:41:52] <otherj> the first is already possible with that one, but i don't want to re-write it for autoplay (to make it easier to upgrade whatever i use in the future)
[05:42:10] <otherj> wowslider does it, but it's pretty heavy
[05:42:49] <litenull> http://www.twospy.com/galleriffic/example-1.html ?
[05:43:12] <otherj> yes!
[05:43:20] <litenull> :)
[05:43:21] <otherj> now i just mofidy it to show thumbnails and we're in business :)
[05:43:24] <otherj> you're good litenull
[05:43:34] <litenull> it has also thumbnails
[05:43:38] <Sonderblade> any way to attach a handler to a checkbox that only triggers when the checkbox is getting checked?
[05:43:40] <litenull> check the main page
[05:43:48] <otherj> yep, the other example has it
[05:43:49] <otherj> i like you sir
[05:43:55] <algizmedia> any of you guys use jquery.pajinate.js?
[05:44:21] <litenull> #jquery helped me, i help #jquery
[05:44:30] <algizmedia> thats the idea
[05:44:35] <otherj> Sonderblade: like .live "change", ->?
[05:44:43] <andrewSC> hi all
[05:45:15] <litenull> otherj: live is deprecated
[05:45:18] * otherj tackles litenull 
[05:45:18] <Sonderblade> otherj: yes, except that triggers on unchecking too
[05:45:25] <otherj> when was live depreciated?
[05:45:40] <otherj> 1.9?
[05:45:56] <litenull> 1.7, 1.9 there is no live
[05:45:57] <litenull> :)
[05:46:07] <otherj> wow
[05:46:13] <otherj> how did i not know that? what replaces it?
[05:46:14] <litenull> use .on
[05:46:16] <otherj> got it
[05:46:36] <otherj> Sonderblade: you could just use .click and then if ‚Ä¶ :checked
[05:46:40] <otherj> unless that's depreciated too:P
[05:46:54] <litenull> i was in the same thing couple days ago :))
[05:47:09] <litenull> had to change half of the scripts
[05:47:23] <otherj> so you could upgrade to 1.9?
[05:47:30] <litenull> yes
[05:47:45] <otherj> is there any compelling reason to do that?
[05:47:58] <litenull> i did it because i was having performance issues
[05:48:02] <litenull> its the same
[05:48:04] <litenull> :)
[05:48:41] <iman> hi, do you know some function to reset form like, $('form').reset();
[05:48:51] <maloik> If I understand this correctly, the now deprecated .live() will listen to events triggered on elements added after the dom is done loading as well. What is the new way to handle these?
[05:49:10] <otherj> $('#myform')[0].reset(); ?
[05:49:11] <litenull> iman: $("input[type=text], textarea").val("") ?
[05:49:33] <iman> thank you
[05:49:35] <litenull> otherj has better solution
[05:49:45] <iman> otherj: let me check it
[05:49:49] <tlkr> maloik, use .on() on a parent element if the elements are created dynamically
[05:49:52] <Sonderblade> otherj: i was hoping for some selector syntax like: $("cb is:checked") or something
[05:50:17] <tlkr> maloik, like $('#parent').on('click', '#dynamicdom', function(event() {})
[05:50:20] <algizmedia> whats the best paginator for jquery?
[05:51:22] <maloik> tlkr: thanks
[05:52:15] <Sonderblade> aha $(document).on("click", "#cb:checked" seem to work
[05:52:49] <otherj> nice
[05:52:57] <otherj> i like concise code
[05:58:53] <nabdev> Hi , i use jquery templates with file upload plugin i have a problem with ";" , any help ?
[05:59:55] <Armistice> lets say you have an element with padding and a border, and you want to set the outerHeight to 300px (but the value in your javascript is 300) how would you go about doing hte calculation.
[06:00:03] <Armistice> outerHeight could do with a set value ;)
[06:00:08] <Armistice> but I don't think it does.
[06:01:31] <computer2000> is there a way to sum up all widths of all elements inside a certain element?
[06:03:40] <Mottie> Armistice: How is your box-sizing css property set?
[06:04:16] <Mottie> computer2000: can you share a jsFiddle of your html
[06:04:50] <Mottie> Armistice: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/box-sizing
[06:05:21] <Armistice> well the thing is if I'm correct, box-sizing is css3
[06:05:30] <softmanpetro> what looks wrong for IE9 with http://pastebin.com/882qPgVV ? please
[06:05:39] <Armistice> and I want what I'm makin to work just aswell on those browsers that don't render CSS3
[06:05:42] <Armistice> such as IE8
[06:06:00] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/jtdLR/1/ any ideas why this is throwing error: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'slideDown('slow')'
[06:06:03] <Mottie> which is supported by all modern browsers... yes, not IE8
[06:06:42] <seutje> nFFF: no jqueries in there
[06:07:08] <nFFF> no jqueries?
[06:07:26] <seutje> $ is undefined
[06:07:31] <seutje> jQuery isn't loaded
[06:07:45] <seutje> no errors once I plonk the library in there
[06:07:52] <nFFF> sorry, locally I meant
[06:08:02] <nFFF> it's not a live example, just the code
[06:09:28] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/jtdLR/4/
[06:09:30] <nFFF> live example
[06:09:51] <seutje> well, it looks like ur trying to call $.fn[slideDown('slow')]()
[06:10:02] <Mottie> nFFF: You're using hoverIntent wrong: http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
[06:10:10] <seutje> which is just not gonna work like that
[06:10:30] <seutje> Mottie: actually, it's a custom hoverIntent included in the example
[06:10:42] <litenull> said enough
[06:10:45] <litenull> :)
[06:10:47] <seutje> yeah, prolly
[06:11:15] <seutje> nFFF: basically, ur function name already includes the caller braces
[06:12:16] <seutje> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/jtdLR/7/ ?
[06:12:36] <seutje> I suck at explaining, can u see what I changed, does it make sense now?
[06:13:07] <nFFF> yes, perfect sense
[06:13:14] <nFFF> feel so stupid
[06:13:20] <seutje> I'm recording this moment
[06:13:28] <litenull> hahaha
[06:13:29] <seutje> no1 ever understand what I'm trying to say q.q
[06:13:35] <seutje> understands even
[06:15:13] <khismetix> Can anyone explain why click event here isn't toggling the size of boxes the way I intend ?
[06:15:14] <khismetix> http://jsfiddle.net/GUs2e/
[06:15:46] <khismetix> basically it "disappears" a box, expands it by 90px, and then contracts it all in one continuous animation
[06:15:50] <nFFF> seutje, your code still throws same erro though?
[06:16:02] <khismetix> I wanted it to simply expand or contract for each successive click event
[06:16:17] <seutje> crap, I didn't actually test it :x
[06:16:26] <seutje> STOP RECORDING, QUICK
[06:17:40] <seutje> nFFF: doesn't seem to throw errors for me, only logs true
[06:18:09] <nFFF> Sorry, your correct
[06:18:14] <nFFF> It doesn't however work :P
[06:18:34] <seutje> granted :P
[06:18:51] <seutje> hey u wanted to get rid of error, u didn't say u actually wanted a working result ;)
[06:19:04] <litenull> priceless
[06:20:33] <litenull> nFFF: look at the docs
[06:20:55] <nFFF> At what specifically?
[06:20:57] <litenull> nFFF: there are 2 required fn you must do
[06:21:15] <litenull> function() { slide.. }
[06:23:15] <seutje> yeah, scoping issue
[06:23:22] <seutje> this is the window object
[06:23:31] <seutje> can't slideDown the window object...
[06:28:03] <Mottie> http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/jtdLR/10/
[06:28:32] <seutje> nFFF: also, u can't slideDown an element that's already at full height
[06:28:36] <Dirkos> What is wrong with this? Seems like swap is triggered alot more that it should after a moment: http://jsfiddle.net/wKaZC/
[06:28:44] <seutje> nFFF: fixed scoping issue and changed to slideUp so u can see it work: http://jsfiddle.net/jtdLR/11/
[06:29:16] <Mottie> nFFF: just use the method described by the docs: http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/jtdLR/10/
[06:30:08] <Mottie> seute: this inside the function is referring to the hovered link, not the stuff that needs to be revealed, I got stuck on that too
[06:30:59] <Mottie> hmmm, ok so I guess I used the actual hoverIntent LOL
[06:34:27] <jackjackw> anybody here know how to trigger jquery.isotope to relayout when a div changes size?
[06:34:50] <jomofcw> Hello !
[06:35:07] <jomofcw> Is there a way to get the inner height of the window element please ?
[06:35:49] <noregret> i used $.getjson() with teh a path, then got an ajx error with the response text as http://pastie.org/5936073 .. the path is the message value.. no idea why that happened, where if try with another 'mailid' it works fine.. any ideas ?
[06:36:27] <jomofcw> $(window).height() should work in fact.
[06:38:30] <Mottie> khismetix: Try this http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/GUs2e/2/
[06:39:23] <khismetix> neat - thx Mottie
[06:39:30] <khismetix> I had originally toyed with using variables
[06:39:31] <Mottie> yw :)
[06:39:47] <khismetix> I though that toggle was meant to do exactly that without a need for a variable ?
[06:40:16] <Mottie> toggle goes from 0 to a height value
[06:40:25] <khismetix> ok
[06:40:35] <Mottie> just like slideup and slidedown
[06:40:58] <khismetix> so toggle can't be used for opposite height adjustment ?
[06:41:04] <khismetix> eg, from height to zero ?
[06:41:13] <Mottie> yeah it can
[06:41:23] <Mottie> but you were resizing from 100 - 190
[06:41:35] <khismetix> ok.. makes sense!
[06:41:56] <Mottie> when the height is zero, toggle also sets it to display: none
[06:42:35] <khismetix> ah ‚Ä¶ ok.. so that is a side effect of toggle .. the display:none behaviour ?
[06:42:41] <Mottie> yep
[06:42:46] <khismetix> interesting .. I see
[06:43:54] <Mottie> noregret: that sounds like a server error, not a jQuery error
[06:44:07] <khismetix> thanks again Mottie
[06:48:55] <seutje> jomofcw: glad to be of service! :P
[06:49:17] <mouses> how do you guys prevent spam while displaying a mailto:email link? besides using a contact form
[06:50:03] <mouses> or even if i just display the plain text w/o link: myemail@domain.com
[06:50:08] <Armistice> usually the mail client will sort that into junk folder
[06:50:09] <Armistice> but
[06:50:10] <mouses> i want to make sure spam bots dont get me
[06:50:38] <Armistice> what you could do (as an attempt, also what I do and what some other people do) is display it like myemail[at]domain[dot]com
[06:50:44] <Armistice> but not a link.
[06:51:03] <mouses> nah i hate that
[06:51:23] <Armistice> Most people tend to be able to interpret such kind of address display ;P
[06:51:31] <Mottie> mouses: you could use javascript to take Armistice's address and turn it into a link
[06:51:38] <Armistice> lol
[06:51:51] <Mottie> I don't think bots run javascript
[06:52:51] <Armistice> it wont prevent it 100% because, all it takes is for someone to write a "web crawler", and scan for email addresses including those that may contain [dot] inside and replace it with .
[06:52:56] <djQuery> ?eval 1+1
[06:52:58] <Armistice> but it's an attempt.
[06:52:59] <bot-t> djQuery: 2
[06:53:10] <djQuery> Mottie, this one can
[06:53:25] <Mottie> djQuery: LOL
[06:53:26] <jomofcw> seutje xD
[06:56:07] <mouses> so whats the standard nowadays to block the spam bots?
[06:56:17] <Mottie> shotguns
[06:56:21] <chrisvtx> hi. i have an issue with autocomplete in different versions of jqueryui:  1.8.17 and 1.9.2
[06:56:34] <Armistice> block unknown senders. XD
[06:56:53] <Mottie> use gmail.. it's awesome at filtering them out
[06:57:00] <Armistice> and especially dont sign up to porn.
[06:57:04] <Mottie> LMAO
[06:57:07] <Armistice> but then again that's not spam ...
[06:57:36] <rwparri2> I'm using the filter function to find some object that I want.  How can I stop after the first object is found?
[06:57:47] <rwparri2> so $('a').filter(function () {return new RegExp(pat, 'i').test($(this).attr('id');}) <- I want this to stop on this first successful match.
[06:58:04] <Mottie> chrisvtx: can you be more specific? A demo would be especially helpful
[06:58:10] <chrisvtx> it seems like in 1.8.17, you can invoke an autocomplete method before the autocomplete is initialize...so something like this works: $(selector).autocomplete("destroy"); $(selector).autocomplete({source:..., minlength:...})
[06:58:45] <Mottie>  $('a').filter(function () {return new RegExp(pat, 'i').test($(this).attr('id');}).filter(':first')
[06:59:15] <chrisvtx> but in version 1.9.2, i get an error wiht that same code that says: "Error: cannot call methods on autocomplete prior to initialization"
[07:00:00] <chrisvtx> so why is there a difference between both ui versions?  why would that code work in the later version (1.8.17) and not the newer version (1.9.2)
[07:00:01] <chrisvtx> ?
[07:00:18] <Mottie> chrisvtx: maybe it's a bug they fixed?
[07:01:01] <chrisvtx> hi mottie.  thanks for your responses.  i checked the changelog between both versions, but saw nothing related to this "fix".
[07:01:03] <chilversc_> Mottie: won't that still build a full array of successful matches first, then pick the first matching one?
[07:01:34] <Mottie> chilversc_: yeah it will
[07:02:04] <^Mike> I have some elements that are being loaded w/ AJAX, and I need to add a .click handler for them. How should I do that?
[07:03:17] <chrisvtx> Mike: try $(outerdiv).on('click', 'targetdiv', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); do your ajax stuff here...});
[07:04:08] <Mottie> ^Mike: you'll need to use the on() function, but delegate the event: http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events... like chrisvtx said
[07:04:15] <Mottie> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[07:04:46] <^Mike> ok, thanks
[07:05:33] <chrisvtx> ^Mike: or to do things the alternate way, you could go $(targetdiv).click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); do ajax stuff here});  But the "on" method is preferred
[07:05:52] <Catmembert> hi there!
[07:06:04] <Mottie> chrisvtx: look at the responses here: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8820
[07:07:01] <^Mike> chrisvtx: Yes, but the point is that targetdiv doesn't exist yet. It'll be added some time later.
[07:07:23] <Mottie> ^Mike that's what delegated events do
[07:07:55] <chrisvtx> ok, then yes, use the .on method and your problem will be solvede
[07:07:59] <toxz> is there a best practive how to handle jquery plugin inclusion for a big site? we have several devs developing independent jquery code for one page using some plugins. so what happens is, that some plugins get included more than once and they stop working...
[07:10:23] <Mottie> toxz: have them communicate?
[07:10:56] <Saaether> or even learn how to read whats already included?
[07:12:10] <Mottie> toxz: better yet, set up your site to use version control... then they have to share the code with each other
[07:14:16] <chrisvtx> Mottie: thanks for the link.  i'm going to do further research
[07:14:24] <Mottie> np!
[07:17:13] <chrisvtx> Mottie: and just for followup, i found a better explanation here: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8796   That seems to describe my issue with this inherited code.  I don't know why someone would try to "destroy" a widget that has not been created yet : )
[07:17:22] <toxz> Mottie - all do have the code, but its so big and old its not possible to check the whole javascript if a plugin is allready included
[07:17:40] <toxz> sometimes its only included just under some circumstances
[07:18:14] <Mottie> chrisvtx: LOL me either
[07:18:21] <toxz> and its not possible to update the jquery without starting everything from scratch in my oppinion :-(
[07:18:39] <Mottie> toxz: :(
[07:18:57] <Mottie> toxz: have you tried?
[07:18:58] <Cork> toxz: uh... update from what to what?
[07:19:00] <toxz> we are using jquery 1.2.6
[07:19:08] <Mottie> it should be compatible
[07:19:36] <toxz> including the new version results in a freezing browser
[07:19:39] <Cork> update past specific versions can be challenging, but overall its not that hard
[07:19:57] <toxz> its hard, because the site is very big
[07:19:57] <Mottie> don't include a new version, replace the old one
[07:20:17] <toxz> yeah of course - i have replaced it
[07:20:20] <toxz> for tests
[07:20:27] <Cork> toxz: i know what you experience, been there my self
[07:20:39] <Cork> my comment is just its not a generic problem
[07:20:51] <Cork> 1.2.x.> 1.3.x is one past 1.5 is another
[07:20:55] <Cork> the rest is quite stable
[07:21:09] <Cork> or rather quite easy
[07:21:33] <toxz> yes - the whole event binding has updated i think
[07:21:49] <Cork> in 1.3 ya, and event bubbling was changed in 1.5
[07:22:15] <toxz> in 1.2.6 this whole live thing is not in, which is deprecated now allready
[07:22:33] <Cork> no not deprecated, its actually removed in latest
[07:23:17] <velcrobots> using a tooltip plugin, want to target the a.tipsy links in this fiddle, but NOT the active one.  siblings?  http://jsfiddle.net/velcrobots/Z53yc/
[07:23:47] <toxz> the problem is its nearly impossible to check the whole site after doing an update
[07:23:55] <toxz> its too big
[07:24:31] <toxz> but its getting harder and harder with new plugins or extensions
[07:24:49] <Cork> toxz: ya, you have to have a test suite to make an update like that
[07:25:09] <Cork> opps hmm why was i in scrollup...
[07:25:36] <sjeijk> can some1 help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/kY7dg/  It's to easy, I need an ajax request, my php file var dumps get and post. However they are empty
[07:25:47] <Cork> toxz: it might actually be time to write tests for the site, so you can test that you don't break things
[07:26:02] <toxz> Cork - problem is - there is not time for doing this
[07:26:31] <toxz> Cork - the only thing we do is putting new features on top
[07:26:34] <Cork> sjeijk: are you actually echoing the content of the variables in the response?
[07:27:01] <Cork> toxz: well, its time to start to slowly built up a test bead
[07:27:05] <Cork> it won't be easier
[07:27:23] <Cork> and it will be close to impossible if you want too long
[07:27:30] <Mottie> velcrobots: just use .qtip("enable") and .qtip("disable")... see http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/Z53yc/15/
[07:27:30] <sjeijk> well yes, butonly now cuz Im testing if my data thats being send actually is being send
[07:28:15] <Cork> sjeijk: and data is an empty string or what?
[07:28:23] <Cork> (in the success handler)
[07:28:42] <toxz> Cork - we allready built a crazy jquery loader for using different jquery versions on one page inside of some callbacks. in my oppinion this is not the way to do it. do you use different versions on one page?
[07:29:07] <sjeijk> actually cork, i expect the var something back
[07:29:44] <sjeijk> afaik I send the var to the script and for now, i want the script to send that var back
[07:29:50] <Cork> toxz: using different versions of jquery on the site is a really bad idea normally
[07:29:53] <sjeijk> data: something
[07:29:59] <Cork> toxz: that said, yes i have, but only two versions
[07:30:22] <velcrobots> Mottie: thanks, but now they're not going away on click
[07:30:32] <Mottie> sjeijk: the response needs to be in JSON format, I think http://www.dev4.thebandwidthmatrix.com/assets/template/main/snippets/properties.php?gime%20something
[07:30:33] <Cork> sjeijk: how are you sending the data from the server side?
[07:30:53] <sjeijk> var_dump($_POST);
[07:30:54] <Cork> Mottie: that depends on how the server sends it
[07:31:04] <Cork> sjeijk: that would mean you send plain text back
[07:31:09] <sjeijk> yes
[07:31:23] <Cork> hmm so ya, data should be a string with that
[07:31:25] <Mottie> velcrobots: use .qtip("hide"); as well... http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/docs/api/#shortcuts
[07:31:39] <Cork> sjeijk: do you see the string in the network tab in the browser?
[07:32:15] <sjeijk> no
[07:32:19] <velcrobots> mottie: i'm using 2
[07:32:29] <Cork> sjeijk: whats in the content of the response?
[07:32:56] <Cork> is it completely empty?
[07:33:06] <sjeijk> cork: yes completely empty
[07:33:22] <sjeijk> somehow my var isnt getting send i assume
[07:33:35] <Cork> sjeijk: if you check the params section, do you see the data you expect to send to the sever there?
[07:33:57] <Mottie> velcrobots : the api looks the same: http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/docs/api/#access
[07:35:45] <sjeijk> cork im not sure where i can find that params section
[07:35:59] <Cork> sjeijk: what browser?
[07:36:05] <sjeijk> safari
[07:36:08] <Cork> ouch
[07:36:12] <Cork> donno then
[07:36:22] <sjeijk> i think its storage
[07:36:33] <sjeijk> or resource
[07:36:57] <Cork> ir should be somewhere related to the request
[07:37:06] <Cork> and request headers
[07:37:29] <velcrobots> mottie: that works, awesome.  thanks.  now just how do I make sure the first initial active item doesn't have a tip on page load
[07:38:12] <sjeijk> cork: got network requests
[07:38:23] <sjeijk> there i can see what properties.php returns
[07:38:25] <Cork> ya, it should be there
[07:38:34] <sjeijk> i cant see what im sending via post
[07:38:37] <sjeijk> afaik
[07:39:10] <Cork> you can't see the request headers like user-agent, accelt-language, accept-encoding and so on?
[07:39:21] <Cork> *accept-language
[07:40:28] <sjeijk> those i can see in 'Resource'
[07:40:42] <Cork> ...
[07:40:47] <Forbidd3n> Anyone know why when you click on an accordion tab that already open it changes the index of that tab to  the length of all tabs (6 for example)
[07:40:57] <sjeijk> i have chrome also
[07:40:58] <Cork> safari is weird with there naming convention...
[07:41:07] <sjeijk> and firefox if thats easier atm
[07:41:30] <Cork> both chrome and firefox show the request params
[07:41:44] <sjeijk> starting chrome
[07:42:52] <Armistice> ttp://jsfiddle.net/6AyaR/ line 82 I'm trying to bind a click event to an element that is not yet created... it doesn't get triggered.
[07:43:17] <Armistice> $("a.modal_close").on("click", ...);
[07:43:47] <Cork> sjeijk: network > "related request url" > headers > Query String Parameters
[07:44:55] <Cork> Armistice: you need to delegate the event listener
[07:45:08] <Cork> you can't select for an element that doesn't exist and bind an event to it
[07:45:30] <Cork> so you need to select for an existing parent, and bind a delegated event listener
[07:46:01] <raj> regardless of the ajax method taking place, I'd like to send an additional key/value in the data. There's http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax_Events but will that just "add" something onto the data, without prelacing it?
[07:46:09] <Cork> Armistice:  $('#some-parent').on('click', 'a.modal_close', function() {})
[07:46:14] <raj> prelacing = replacing
[07:46:53] <delac> cant seem to be able to change background-color for placeholder on sortable. Using:   ...sortable({placeholder:"ph"})  and .ph {background-color:red}    What else is needed?
[07:47:30] <Cork> raj: best option is prob to demand that an object is sent to a wrapper you have; and that you add your values to the object before passing it on to $.ajax
[07:47:50] <Mottie> Armistice: Try this  $("body").on("click", "a.modal_close", function(e) {   http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/6AyaR/1/
[07:48:07] <raj> Cork, wrapper of the `data`
[07:48:07] <sjeijk> cork: i see network > properties.php > Form data
[07:48:08] <raj> ?
[07:48:14] <Forbidd3n> Here is an example of what I am referring to (using console) you can see when you click a tab, it gives the correct index, but when you click the already opened tab it gives a different index of 6
[07:48:15] <Forbidd3n> http://jsfiddle.net/fFjnh/
[07:48:20] <sjeijk> headers > form data
[07:48:40] <sjeijk> but i dont see query string data
[07:49:08] <Cork> raj: function myAjax(url, data) { data.special = [1,2,3]; return $.ajax(url, data); }
[07:49:22] <Armistice> mmk thanks mottie
[07:49:25] <sjeijk> and there I do see my msg that's being send cork
[07:49:44] <schopenhauer> Hi. Are these two the same? https://gist.github.com/4665243
[07:49:52] <Cork> sjeijk: ok, and have you checked that the php side actually finds the info?
[07:49:58] <schopenhauer> as in does the second one already assume DOM is loaded?
[07:50:10] <Cork> sjeijk: php needs a key=value pare for it to work with $_POST
[07:50:46] <Mottie> schopenhauer: I think jQuery is just going to add it to the que of scripts to run when the document is ready, so really there isn't a difference
[07:50:54] <BillCriswell> schopenhauer: You are waiting till the document is REALLY ready it seems.
[07:51:04] <Cork> schopenhauer: no the first one has ready twice
[07:51:18] <velcrobots> mottie: any idea on how to disable the qtip for the initially active item on page load?
[07:51:20] <Cork> $(function() {}) is the same as $(document).ready(function() {});
[07:51:22] <sjeijk> cork: should I send my ajax request like so? data: "somestring" or like so? data: key=>"somestring"
[07:51:29] <schopenhauer> cool. just wanted to make sure Jquery is available because I'm loading it at the end of each page
[07:51:35] <schopenhauer> just before </body>
[07:51:38] <Mottie> velcrobots: is the active class there on load?
[07:51:43] <Cork> sjeijk: data: { msg: "something" }
[07:51:45] <velcrobots> yes
[07:52:21] <Cork> sjeijk: and then you get that as $_POST["msg"]
[07:52:30] <Mottie> then just add jQuery("#services-nav a.active").qtip("disable"); after you initialize qtips
[07:52:36] <mboro> hi, when I add a bunch of rows to a <tbody>, jquery creates a new tbody inside the tbody that already exists. is this expected?
[07:52:59] <Mottie> mboro: that's a known bug in jQuery 1.9.0
[07:53:03] <sjeijk> <3 cork
[07:53:06] <sjeijk> thanks
[07:53:08] <Cork> mboro: no
[07:53:10] <Cork> sjeijk: np
[07:53:11] <Forbidd3n> anyone on the accordion question, please?
[07:53:23] <mboro> Mottie: ah, alright. thx :)
[07:53:44] <Cork> Mottie: interesting;: do you have a bug link?
[07:54:00] <Mottie> sec
[07:55:30] <Mottie> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13232
[07:56:03] <raj> Cork, so basically I'd have to change every ajax call
[07:56:06] <raj> to use my function instead
[07:56:14] <Mottie> oh opps that in v2.0
[07:56:31] <mboro> Mottie: yeah, I'm using v2.0
[07:56:34] <mboro> will downgrade
[07:56:37] <Cork> raj: you could overide the default ajax function if you prefer that :)
[07:57:01] <Cork> raj: and you might be able to fiddle with the data in one of the extention callbacks
[07:57:01] <MacroMan> I've come across this style of html creation: http://pastebin.com/34i0M8gv . is this documented anywhere?
[07:57:11] <Cork> but i usually find its easier to just do it with a wrapper
[07:58:19] <Cork> (function() { var ajax = $.ajax; $.ajax = function(url, data) { data.special = [1]; return ajax(url, data); }; })();
[07:58:24] <Cork> raj: ^
[07:58:30] <velcrobots> mottie: awesome.  thanks.
[07:58:38] <Cork> wouldn't recommend doing that though :)
[08:00:50] <Cork> raj: you might be able to do it with http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxPrefilter/
[08:01:50] <Cork> raj: something like $.ajaxPrefilter(function(options) { options.data.special = [1]; });
[08:01:55] <Cork> but never tried so not sure
[08:02:43] <Mottie> Forbidd3n: Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/fFjnh/3/
[08:03:59] <Mottie> Forbidd3n: ui.newHeader and ui.oldHeader are returning an empty jQuery object, I'm not sure why the index is giving them a number
[08:04:01] <jackjackw> guys - creating a site - using isotope to layout dynamically created html pulled from flickr's api. on click the divs resize to show a whole other set of content - slide out effect - but when they do, isotopes layout does not refresh
[08:04:11] <jackjackw> anyone got any experience working with isotope?
[08:07:00] <Forbidd3n> Mottie: yeah, but how does it come up with the index number is the question.
[08:07:17] <Mottie> not sure... investigating now
[08:09:50] <algizmedia> anyone know how to get two .jPaginate()'s working? works great until i add rtghe second one
[08:10:23] <algizmedia> then i click next and the second controls disappear, and both divs go to the next page lol!
[08:11:54] <Forbidd3n> algizmedia: can you create an example?
[08:12:36] <delac> cant seem to be able to change background-color for placeholder on sortable. Using:   ...sortable({placeholder:"ph"})  and .ph {background-color:red}    What else is needed?
[08:13:50] <raj> Cork, Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'special' of undefined
[08:14:08] <raj> so options.data is undefined I guess
[08:14:14] <Cork> raj: on options.data ?
[08:14:20] <Cork> ah
[08:14:21] <Cork> pitty
[08:14:42] <Cork> check the other members on that Prefilter there might be something there
[08:14:52] <Cork> (again never used it)
[08:14:56] <wolfehr> is it possible, once you've done $('form').submit(function(e){e.preventDefault()} to submit that form normally again?
[08:15:19] <Cork> wolfehr: this.submit()
[08:15:39] <Cork> that is submit() on the dom element, without jquery wrapper
[08:15:46] <wolfehr> but won't form.submit() trigger the handler assigned and end up in a recursive loop?
[08:15:51] <Cork> no
[08:15:56] <wolfehr> what if we don't have it available as this
[08:15:58] <Cork> $(this).submit() would
[08:16:10] <Cork> $('form')[0].submit()
[08:19:19] <Ziber> I was looking at a simple jquery plugin for horizontal sliding menus, but I can't seem to remember the name. Any thoughts?
[08:19:30] <wolfehr> that won't work, I can't assume the form has a position in the page, can you reenable the default behaviour at all?
[08:20:44] <wolfehr> I assume i can just unbind, hopefully that'll sort it
[08:21:48] <HM> anyone know of an accordion widget that slides the open section to the top when you open it?
[08:22:02] <HM> I'm not even sure if it's a good idea from a usability perspective
[08:22:34] <BillCriswell> HM: All that shit looks nice but it rarely does anything for the user.
[08:22:40] <BillCriswell> Mostly just for some suit to jerk off to.
[08:22:52] <HM> well accordions are compact
[08:23:36] <BillCriswell> HM: Is the content important that's going inside the accordions?
[08:23:57] <HM> it's a menu where each expanded part is a different category of searchable thing
[08:24:59] <HM> e.g. expand 'country' whack 'eng' in the search box, click England. Or expand Cities, type in 'lond' and click London.
[08:25:07] <BillCriswell> HM: Is it a horizontal or vertical accordion?
[08:25:13] <HM> vertical
[08:25:31] <HM> although i'm still experimenting
[08:25:47] <BillCriswell> So if there's tons of results in the first box they'll have to scroll down to see that there's more areas "sections" that they can search?
[08:26:06] <micz123> hi all, newbie here :) want to ask how to do simple ajax 'like' button
[08:26:45] <HM> BillCriswell: there's no scrolling atm
[08:27:36] <BillCriswell> Will there be? If so those areas at the bottom might not be very discoverable.
[08:28:03] <HM> they will be, they won't be off screen
[08:28:17] <BillCriswell> HM: You going to make that area scrollable?
[08:28:27] <HM> inside the accordion section?
[08:28:47] <HM> the container the accordion lives in isn't scrollable
[08:28:48] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:28:54] <HM> it's a side pane
[08:29:00] <BillCriswell> What happens if there's tons of content in there though?
[08:29:26] <micz123> can someone pls point me a good tutorial on jquery ajax?
[08:29:27] <BillCriswell> micz123: You would just post to a "like.php" script or something, like $.post('like.php', { id: 91893 }, function(result){ // It's "liked!" });
[08:29:36] <HM> seems unlikely, when the search box is blank i will list the most likely items, whether they are popular or recent
[08:29:44] <Mottie> Forbidd3n: that looks like a bug in .index()... I set up this demo (http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/FMh69/) and created this bug report http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13347
[08:29:58] <algizmedia> are there any jquery ninjas in the house? http://jsfiddle.net/delboy1978uk/yDZJZ/1/  two paginators on one page
[08:30:29] <HM> BillCriswell: visually though, when the middle accordion is open there are headers top and bottom, which looks a bit strange, hence the bubble up idea
[08:30:47] <HM> but that might confuse the user if things move
[08:30:52] <BillCriswell> HM: Everything about that sounds messy.
[08:31:06] <BillCriswell> sounds like it could get messy*
[08:31:18] <HM> it's a data intensive site with a lot of content to search through
[08:31:40] <HM> having an untyped search box that searches all 'kinds of thing' isn't ideal
[08:32:04] <HM> and even if you have a traditional search and dropdown combo you still need a menu of some kind full of a lot of recent items
[08:33:37] <Mottie> HM: have you heard of elasticsearch? http://www.elasticsearch.org/
[08:34:06] <Armistice> I have literally seen this not long ago, but I cannot remember where I saw it ... or how it was done, but was using -= to subtract a specific amount from the height of an element.
[08:34:14] <Armistice> but i cannot remember where i saw it.
[08:34:29] <algizmedia> any geniuses (genii?!) can help with this? http://jsfiddle.net/delboy1978uk/yDZJZ/3/
[08:34:43] <HM> Mottie: looks interesting but doesn't seem to be a UI component
[08:35:13] <Mottie> Armistice: was it this demo? http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/GUs2e/2/
[08:35:25] <HM> Mottie: oh i see the demo at the top
[08:35:31] <dwils> @HM: github, fogcreek, and other use it
[08:35:51] <HM> That doesn't really give you a typed search
[08:36:20] <Mottie> the search input is at the top of the screen
[08:36:31] <dwils> i might have missed the first half of the conversation, sorry
[08:36:45] <dwils> are you looking for type-ahead or something?
[08:37:52] <HM> i may use typeahead i'm not sure, but what i mean is. when someone wants to find something using a city name they don't want the names of people popping up because they're called George Washington
[08:38:04] <HM> hence it's a category based search
[08:38:43] <BillCriswell> HM: http://jsbin.com/icixom/1/edit For just getting the clicked element to the top this is the best way I can think of?
[08:38:49] <HM> using a single search box means you have to either have some googlesque syntax "city:wash" or have a drop down to specify the type...OR worse, do a global search which produces messy results
[08:39:12] <HM> since each category may have its own sorting criteria
[08:39:40] <HM> hmm BillCriswell: I'll experiment with that
[08:39:42] <dwils> have you seen how google handles some of the most widely used search criteria?
[08:39:50] <BillCriswell> HM: I understand your concerns. I don't think an accordion will help though.
[08:40:15] <HM> dwils: what specifically?
[08:41:27] <Armistice> It wasn't that demo, Mottie but it was along those lines. Found it here: $( this ).css( "width","+=200" );
[08:41:33] <Armistice> which is simmilar to what you were doing anyway :) all good.
[08:41:54] <dwils> see i still might not know exactly what you're going for
[08:42:11] <dwils> but if you actually go to the google search
[08:42:34] <dwils> past the landing, and into the query results...it has "search tools"
[08:42:58] <HM> ah yeah
[08:43:09] <dwils> but it sounds like you just want a single search box?
[08:45:09] <HM> one search box, searches always operate over one class of object
[08:46:18] <HM> like imagine you were searching for a politician, it'd be easy to search by name. but you also might want to find them by state or constituency
[08:46:52] <HM> rather than having a big ass search form with a million fields the idea is to flip open the "constituency" accordion, type in the name of your constituency and bobs your uncle, list of local politicians
[08:47:20] <dwils> hmm
[08:47:44] <Mottie> that can be done by combining search parameters.... "politicians AND constituency"
[08:48:04] <HM> yep, but the actual use case has to be *fast*
[08:48:32] <HM> think of it as a query builder without complex expressions
[08:48:36] <BillCriswell> Accordions are going to slow people down.
[08:48:44] <dwils> http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[08:48:45] <HM> as opposed to what?
[08:48:58] <Mottie> so always use AND, then if the user adds a comma or something, treat it as an OR
[08:49:25] <HM> dwils, that isn't bad actually
[08:49:46] <Mottie> AND: "politicians constituency", OR ""politicians, constituency""
[08:50:05] <dwils> yeah, i'm pushing for adoption for some of our projects
[08:50:13] <BillCriswell> Mottie: We search like that, not everyone knows those "tricks".
[08:50:23] <dwils> ^
[08:50:43] <HM> dwils, but that still involves more than one search box for each *type* of tag or filter
[08:50:49] <dwils> kinda like a <10% power-user kinda thing
[08:51:05] <dwils> yeah
[08:51:32] <Mottie> dwils: I've heard https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2 is better than chosen
[08:51:41] <BillCriswell> It's definitely a tough balancing act, but I just think the accordion pattern is a bad one. If search is fast enough people will adjust them.
[08:51:57] <Mottie> BillCriswell: yeah, I see your point
[08:52:20] <Ziber> Anyone familiar with jquery.hoverscroll.js, can I set the height parameter in em?
[08:52:48] <HM> hmm
[08:53:04] <Mottie> BillCriswell: but I'm also thinking if people are familiar with Google search, they can use the search the same way
[08:53:36] <dwils> it'd be interesting to get some of the data on how often people use google's keywords
[08:54:10] <dwils> because that's kinda where you're putting your eggs @HM, right?
[08:54:22] <HM> eggs? :\
[08:54:51] <BillCriswell> Mottie: Definitely.
[08:55:23] <HM> oh eggs in a basket
[08:55:23] <dwils> hmm...are you're betting that people's familiarity with google's keyword will translate to your search?
[08:55:26] <dwils> yeah
[08:55:48] <dwils> i didn't know if that was a southern term or something
[08:55:54] <HM> i don't want keywords or magic syntax
[08:55:58] <delboy1978uk> Anyone used jPaginate? tryning to get two on one page        http://jsfiddle.net/delboy1978uk/yDZJZ/3/
[08:56:32] <Mottie> algizmedia: Honestly, I wouldn't use jPaginate... I don't think it's been updated in a long time and this demo page (http://tympanus.net/jPaginate/) is messed up for me.
[08:56:47] <Mottie> or delboy1978... LOL
[08:56:47] <HM> I think i'll experiment with select2
[08:57:03] <BillCriswell> Mottie: Those keys are like... right next to eachother.
[08:57:10] <BillCriswell> Understandable mistake!
[08:57:39] <Mottie> BillCriswell: LOL if you scroll up algizmedia asked a similar question LOL
[08:57:46] <BillCriswell> Haha oh ok.
[08:57:53] <djQuery> document.getElementById('test').ownerDocument   should never return null as long as an element with that id exists should it?
[08:57:54] <Mottie> same demo too o.O
[08:58:30] <BillCriswell> I just found out zen coding was renamed "emmet". Wonder how long ago that was.
[09:00:55] <djQuery> am I the only one that not liking jsfiddle's new lint
[09:01:21] <Mottie> yeah I forget to look for the red dot
[09:01:34] <djQuery> and the red dots dont work in chrome
[09:01:49] <Mottie> they do for me
[09:02:05] <djQuery> jsbin and as you type linting  FTW
[09:03:24] <coderhut> Hi experts, have anyone come across situation where this jquery statment jQuery(this).is(':checked')  returns true in firefox but returns false in IE7 and IE8? any solution for this problem?
[09:04:33] <Cork> coderhut: on an input type="checkbox" ?
[09:04:41] <djQuery> does 7 and 8 support that sudo selector?
[09:04:48] <coderhut> Cork: yes
[09:04:54] <Cork> djQuery: its pure jquery so ya
[09:04:57] <delboy1978uk> Mottie thanks, I've been hacking at it because I can't find a single plugin that'll generate bootstrap compatible paging markup
[09:05:12] <djQuery> coderhut, what version of jquery
[09:05:32] <motka> I want to invest 1 mil. dollars into the jQuery foundation
[09:05:34] <Cork> coderhut: and jQuery(this).prop('checked') returns the correct value?
[09:06:40] <coderhut> djQuery: its  v1.8.2
[09:06:46] <hateIE> hi
[09:06:59] <coderhut> Cork: let me check please
[09:07:14] <djQuery> coderhut, cool thats before they dropped ie 6,7,8 support
[09:07:36] <Cork> djQuery: they haven't really dropped older ie yet
[09:07:46] <Cork> they have an alternative lib without the support
[09:07:51] <Cork> but its not dropped
[09:07:58] <djQuery> Cork, thought they allready moved it to a plugin
[09:08:04] <Cork> 1.9 and 2.0 is basically the same lib
[09:08:05] <Cork> no
[09:08:17] <Cork> 2.0 is with the old ie support removed
[09:08:18] <djQuery> cool thanks for the clarification
[09:08:38] <djQuery> come on 2.0
[09:08:40] <Cork> 2.0 is a smaller faster version of 1.9 :)
[09:09:01] <Cork> and both will be supported along side each other
[09:09:09] <djQuery> http://www.saveie6.com/
[09:09:15] <Cork> XD
[09:09:22] <Cork> i love that prank site
[09:09:22] <djQuery> go through the download wizard its funny
[09:09:33] <hateIE> ok i have the following ... $("#dashmenu a").click(function(e){  ... });   in the function i have this ..	e.preventDefault();
[09:09:33] <hateIE> 	 if ($(this).hasClass('disabledbtn')) {
[09:09:33] <hateIE>  	 return false;
[09:09:33] <hateIE> 	 } else {
[09:09:33] <hateIE> 	 $(this).addClass('disabledbtn');
[09:09:33] <hateIE> 	 load_message_center(currentid)
[09:09:33] <hateIE> 	 }
[09:09:34] <hateIE> ... which works very well.. but I cant understand how .disablebtn is being some how reset
[09:09:43] <Cork> ?p @ hateIE
[09:09:44] <bot-t> hateIE, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:09:46] <djQuery> hateIE, see ?paste
[09:09:47] <bot-t> hateIE, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:10:05] <coderhut> Cork: jQuery(this).prop('checked') this returns true in firefox and returns false twice in IE 8
[09:10:10] <Cork> there twice, so you REALLY should do that :D
[09:10:30] <Cork> coderhut: so its a bug in ie
[09:10:42] <Cork> ie thinks the checkbox is unchecked
[09:10:53] <coderhut> hmmm...
[09:11:03] <Cork> coderhut: have you checked so you don't have duplicate elements or something like that?
[09:11:05] <hateIE> http://jsfiddle.net/4MFYE/
[09:11:16] <Cork> like two input fields with the same id or something
[09:11:26] <hateIE> no where in my code do i .removeClass('disabledbtn');
[09:11:52] <coderhut> Cork: let me make sure this thing again please
[09:12:07] <hateIE> but it works so I am no knocking it but why lol.. surely it should be disabled for ever not just till it magically knows the users wants to click again
[09:12:19] <djQuery> hateIE, by the way var currentid = $(this).attr('id');   and be just this.id
[09:13:00] <hateIE> alright tnx
[09:13:25] <Kakera> could someone explain this
[09:13:25] <Kakera> http://privatepaste.com/6013f08dd5
[09:13:36] <Kakera> you have to be logged into Steam for this to work
[09:13:53] <mg983> Good morning.
[09:13:58] <micz123> billcrisswell thx, I'll try that :D Im looking at angularjs as well, can angularjs and jquery work together? I mean im planning on using some code from jquery and for others i'll use angularjs
[09:14:10] <coderhut> Cork: nops all has different ids, though id and name of each checkbox is same
[09:14:31] <Cork> coderhut: is same?
[09:14:44] <Cork> coderhut: you mean is uniq right?
[09:14:44] <Kakera> am I experiencing a bug in jquery?
[09:14:48] <djQuery> hateIE, this is how I would write it http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/4MFYE/1/
[09:14:58] <coderhut> Cork: yes ids are unique of each checkbox
[09:15:38] <djQuery> but I digress whats wrong with it
[09:16:12] <Kakera> if you're logged into Steam, could you try this? http://privatepaste.com/6013f08dd5
[09:16:23] <Cork> Kakera: jquery 1.9?
[09:16:32] <Kakera> jquery-latest
[09:16:39] <dblosevn> Kakera: $.get expects json as a reponse, try $.get(url, callback, 'html')
[09:16:43] <Cork> and that is?
[09:16:54] <Cork> dblosevn: no it doesn't
[09:16:57] <Kakera> dblosevn, it works fine for other pages
[09:17:05] <fission6> i am not sure jquery is all that I need vs a framework as eel but i am not sure what framework to go with. to describe. my page is loading a json service which loads about 50 items. i then want to build a small filtering system which updates the ui based on options / filtering selected by the user. whats an ideal framework to manage the filtering options and updating the ui. ?
[09:17:09] <Cork> $.get accepts most anything
[09:17:18] <Cork> $.getJSON expects json
[09:17:18] <dblosevn> $.get also wont work cross domain
[09:17:36] <Kakera> I suppose it's 1.9.0
[09:17:52] <Cork> Kakera: open the file and look at the first line
[09:18:01] <dblosevn> oh... console.log($jq(data));
[09:18:02] <Kakera> Cork, I'm running it from dev console
[09:18:12] <Kakera> with jQuerify plugin
[09:18:12] <djQuery> fission6, have you looked at ?knockout.js
[09:18:24] <dblosevn> thats not a valid dom object
[09:18:42] <Kakera> dblosevn, it works perfectly for other pages
[09:18:51] <djQuery> ?knockout.js@fission6
[09:18:55] <bot-t> fission6, event.currentTarget | jQuery API Documentation - The current DOM element within the event bubbling phase. http://api.jquery.com/event.currentTarget/
[09:18:55] <dblosevn> jquery doesnt know what to do with a whole html doc its breaking on the document delcaration
[09:18:58] <Kakera> and yeah it's 1.9.0
[09:19:01] <Cork> so run $jq.fn.jquery
[09:19:23] <Cork> Kakera: do you get the same error if you pick 1.8.x ?
[09:19:40] <Cork> 1.8.3
[09:20:00] <Kakera> uhh, how do I load a specific jQuery version to an arbitrary page?
[09:20:11] <Kakera> I'm just using jQuerify bookmarklet
[09:20:31] <Kakera> I guess I could try modifying it
[09:22:01] <Cork> ya, that's prob the simplest
[09:22:03] <coderhut> Cork: can you suggest any other solution for this problem
[09:22:08] <Kakera> Cork, it works fine with 1.8.3
[09:22:16] <Kakera> regression?
[09:22:32] <fission6> djQuery: how do you like knockout compared to spine and backbone?
[09:22:41] <Cork> coderhut: try to make a reduced testcase
[09:22:59] <Cork> coderhut: and might be worth trying older versions of jquery and see if that changes anything
[09:23:06] <Kakera> Cork, should I report this bug or something
[09:23:06] <Cork> Kakera: might be
[09:23:07] <Mottie> Kakera: Are you using userscripts?
[09:23:09] <djQuery> fission6, to tell the truth after seeing the tuts on knockout I havent even tried the rest
[09:23:12] <Cork> Kakera: i would
[09:23:17] <coderhut> Cork: okay...thanks
[09:23:32] <djQuery> fission6, I have seen a couple plugins for backbone to make it more knockout ish
[09:23:35] <fission6> yea there is like angelur.js knockout spine and backbone, not sure what to use
[09:23:38] <Kakera> Mottie, right now I'm just playing around in the dev console
[09:23:58] <Mottie> ahh ok
[09:24:04] <djQuery> fission6, I just wen with the one that I liked the documentation on
[09:24:11] <fission6> nice
[09:24:22] <fission6> would dlike to hear from anyone who has used a few frameworks
[09:24:41] <fission6> djQuery: i assume knockout has been productive for yu
[09:25:11] <djQuery> I looked at backbone when I was getting started with that kinda thing but didn't like the documentation so I moved on
[09:25:20] <djQuery> hopefully the docs have improved
[09:25:49] <djQuery> fission6, I havent run into any big issues with it after the initial learning curve
[09:29:07] <djQuery> fission6, also hang out in thier respective ircs
[09:29:16] <fission6> yea i will
[09:31:16] <motka> hi there!
[09:34:01] <hateIE> any one know how that code i pasted is working ... like I say that code is not dynamically created nor is there any other part of the code that will specially .removeClass('disabledbtn'); ...
[09:34:57] <hateIE> and I presume does .css rewrite the whole css for the the element right?
[09:34:59] <Mottie> hateIE: this code? http://jsfiddle.net/4MFYE/
[09:35:10] <hateIE> yeh
[09:35:23] <Cork> hateIE: is there anything in the code that puts html in the page?
[09:35:40] <Cork> hateIE: ex. template libs usually replace all dom elements with a cache it has
[09:35:45] <Cork> so it can be something like that
[09:36:10] <hateIE> the not the #notification is generated once when the site loads as part of the "member area"
[09:36:33] <Mottie> hateIE: .css does not rewrite all the css for an element, it only targets one specific parameter
[09:37:12] <Mottie> Hi Motka!! Nice first 3 letters of your name! :P
[09:38:04] <hateIE> I guess the behavior is undesireable ..
[09:38:19] <hateIE> it works but it feels wrong
[09:38:39] <Cork> hateIE: what is?
[09:39:02] <hateIE> well the thing i was trying to deal with is preventing the user from clicking twice
[09:39:49] <Mottie> hateIE: instead of adding a "disabledbtn" class, add the disabled attribute: $(this).prop('disabled', true);
[09:40:14] <djQuery> hateIE, .css just merges whatever you pass to it with the current css
[09:40:20] <Cork> Mottie: disabled isn't supported on links
[09:40:24] <Cork> only form elements
[09:40:40] <Mottie> I didn't see any HTML, so I assumed btn meant button
[09:40:55] <hateIE> yeah they are for <button>
[09:41:04] <Mottie> LOL but I missing the selector... it's an "a"
[09:41:13] <Cork> hateIE: could you try to actually reproduce the problem in the fiddle?
[09:41:24] <Mottie> $("#dashmenu a") targets a link, not a button
[09:41:26] <hateIE> yeah sure
[09:41:27] <Cork> i have a bit of a problem seeing what you have problem with
[09:42:06] <Trisox> and the evening starts
[09:42:08] <Trisox> :D
[09:42:11] <Mottie> lol
[09:42:18] <Mottie> it's not even noon here
[09:42:23] <Mottie> OMG lunch time!
[09:42:26] <Trisox> 18:42
[09:42:29] <djQuery> I need a new name for this plugin that I am writing   http://jsbin.com/ukixuc/9/edit
[09:42:30] <Trisox> haha
[09:42:36] <Trisox> just had supper
[09:42:44] <Trisox> dinner what ever you wanna call it
[09:42:47] <Trisox> :D
[09:42:56] <Kambfhase> High tea
[09:43:07] <djQuery> it allows you to override the stock X button on .dialog and put any button(s) that you want there
[09:43:09] <Mottie> 15th tea
[09:43:12] <Trisox> that is something diverent over here ;)
[09:43:37] <djQuery> .window  might be confused with document.window though
[09:43:46] <djQuery> any suggestions
[09:43:56] <Kambfhase> and what about second breakfast, elevensis, dinner, supper?
[09:44:03] <Mottie> djQuery: the last w in Window is overlapped =(
[09:44:22] <Kambfhase> document.window ?
[09:45:14] <djQuery> Mottie, good that means that the buttons are staying on top of the title like they are supposed to
[09:45:30] <Trisox> brunch for the win
[09:45:46] <Mottie> but I'm reading "Windo".. I thougth it was "Wino" at first... *hic*
[09:46:03] <djQuery> Mottie, that is the expected behavior if the "dialog" is too small title + the buttons
[09:46:17] <Mottie> Wino buttons!
[09:46:20] <Mottie> :P
[09:46:32] <djQuery> better than the alternative of the title not allowing you access to the buttons
[09:46:57] <Mottie> ellipsis would be better... or wrapping
[09:47:14] <Trisox> jquery ui dialog windows extention :D
[09:47:36] <Trisox> full window extention
[09:47:46] <djQuery> Mottie, not that good at css for the elipses and arent there some cross browser issues with that?
[09:47:48] <Mottie> correction ellipses... I need a caffeine recharge
[09:48:00] <Trisox> :D
[09:48:15] <Cork> why call it window when its still a dialog?
[09:48:17] <Mottie> yeah, it's css3... so modern browsers get the benefit, older browsers will see Wino!!
[09:48:33] <Cork> call it dialogEx or something
[09:48:51] <Mottie> Buttonator!
[09:50:07] <Mottie> djQuery: http://www.css3.info/preview/text-overflow/ ; try text-overflow: clip;
[09:50:44] <djQuery> Mottie, http://www.quirksmode.org/css/textoverflow.html   like the ellisis better
[09:50:45] <Trisox> its still based on dialog's
[09:50:49] <Trisox> of jquery ui
[09:50:57] <Trisox> Cork:
[09:50:59] <Trisox> and its an extention
[09:51:05] <djQuery> Trisox, yes it inherits from ui.dialog
[09:51:14] <Trisox> i read it ;)
[09:51:17] <djQuery> I am just overriding the create
[09:51:29] <Mottie> that works too :)
[09:52:14] <Trisox> still got some work to do on it but start is nice ;)
[09:53:13] <djQuery> Mottie, hmmmmm .ui-dialog .ui-dialog-title allready has text-overflow: ellipsis;
[09:53:29] <Trisox> there some real usefull cases for that ;
[09:53:38] <Trisox> \o/
[09:53:43] <Mottie> Hmmm, I guess it needs to be resized then
[09:53:57] <djQuery> Trisox, yeah need to add a default value so that peeps can use it instead of ui.dialog
[09:54:09] <hateIE> yeah i think its the cache like you say Cork
[09:54:13] <hateIE> http://jsfiddle.net/4MFYE/8/
[09:54:16] <Trisox> i would make an extention or something
[09:54:32] <djQuery> Trisox, submitting a FR ticket on dialog to refactor the create close button then the code will be a little easier
[09:54:36] <hateIE> as you can see in the fiddle its not really making it to load_msg_center()

[10:30:32] <Nece228> hi
[10:31:52] <BadCodSmell> How can I get this to work: $('div', $('<div/>'))
[10:33:05] <stockmania> i'm having trouble using the .on() event handler to replace the old .live() handler. i cant seem to bind events to an element added to the dom after page load
[10:33:35] <Mottie> BedCodSmell: that will never work because the $('<div/>') is detached from the DOM and not part of $('div')
[10:33:45] <stockmania> http://pastie.org/5943031
[10:34:03] <Kambfhase> Mottie: you are wrong.
[10:34:16] <Mottie> stockmania: share some HTML please
[10:34:30] <stockmania> sure one sec
[10:34:40] <Mottie> Kambfhase: can you elaborate?
[10:34:57] <Kambfhase> stockmania: e is undefined
[10:35:23] <BadCodSmell> Mottie, it does work for things inside of div
[10:35:37] <Mottie> the newly created one?
[10:35:39] <Emil> Hello. I was wondering if it is possible to get the current animation settings? I want to .stop() an animation, and then, depending on the settings, do something...
[10:35:47] <BadCodSmell> $('div', $('<div><div></div></div>'))
[10:36:07] <BadCodSmell> I'm just wondering if there is any other way to get this to work without wrapping it
[10:36:09] <Mottie> Ok, I stand corrected
[10:36:17] <Nece228> how to swap values? "$(this).find('a').replaceWith($(this).prev().find('a'));  $(this).prev().find('a').replaceWith('$(this).find('a')')" doesnt work
[10:36:19] <Mottie> what are you trying to do?
[10:36:45] <gnarf> Nece228: swapping is actually kinda rough
[10:37:12] <Nece228> gnarf: what do you suggest then?
[10:37:17] <BadCodSmell> In other cases top level elements work in jquery so I think there's a bug
[10:37:20] <gnarf> Nece228: obviously once you move one of the items, there is no way to know where it >was<
[10:37:23] <BadCodSmell> Using the latest jquery
[10:37:30] <stockmania> kambfhasse: http://pastie.org/5943064
[10:37:33] <Kambfhase> BadCodSmell: what are you trying to do? why not use .filter()?
[10:37:49] <Nece228> gnarf: yes, i should probably create variable to store information
[10:37:52] <gnarf> Nece228: is this just like a general purpose swap - or is there a predefined DOM that thils will work in?
[10:38:00] <Nece228> but it seems a bit like a workaround
[10:38:09] <BadCodSmell> filter could be the answer, let me try
[10:38:17] <Nece228> gnarf: its gonna be like in the example
[10:38:28] <Nece228> i need to swap image thumbnails
[10:38:42] <Mottie> stockmania: the reason I asked is because the format is $(wrapper).on("click", dynamicContent, function(event){ ... are those links to your site?
[10:38:50] <BadCodSmell> >>> var megapants=$('<div></div>');megapants.filter('div'); -> jQuery(div)
[10:38:52] <BadCodSmell> awesome
[10:38:57] <Kambfhase> stockmania: .on() can take a selector argument
[10:38:58] <gnarf> Nece228: you need to do something almost like var placeholder = $("<span>"), first = $(this).find("a"), second = $(this).prev().find("a");  first.replaceWith( placeholder ); second.replaceWith( first ); placeholder.replaceWith( second );
[10:38:58] <Emil> anybody? :>
[10:39:22] <BadCodSmell> It's a shame that doesn't work with remove
[10:39:33] <Kambfhase> filter and remove?
[10:39:36] <Mottie> Emil: what settings?
[10:39:38] <gnarf> Nece228: just so your temporary <span> you create can hold the place where the first was removed from
[10:39:43] <stockmania> Kambfhase: the selector part is tripping me up I suspect
[10:39:54] <Emil> Mottie: Those provided to .animate()
[10:40:06] <stockmania> Kambfhase: I need a to reference the parent of the element clicked, is that possible with .on() ?
[10:40:18] <Mottie> Emil: can you share some code?
[10:40:22] <hateIE> http://fiddle.jshell.net/4MFYE/29/  <-- working version if any one needs to do something like that with there project
[10:40:50] <Darkstar1> Hello ppl. I have the following: $(this).next("ul.submenu").slideToggle("slow").siblings("ul.submenu").slideUp("slow");
[10:40:58] <Nece228> gnarf: thats interesting, i never used <span> before
[10:41:30] <Mottie> stockmania: which part is loaded dynamically?
[10:41:42] <Darkstar1> instead of siblings, how can I target the parent node?
[10:41:46] <Emil> Mottie: this is basically what I have: foo.animate({ opacity: 0.5 });. I also have one that goes the other way. So if somebody clicks a button, I will animate it one way or the other, depending on the state.
[10:42:01] <Kambfhase> .parent()
[10:42:19] <Darkstar1> hhmm.. thought so.. just wondering why it's not working
[10:42:55] <stockmania> Mottie: checking my code for a minute..
[10:44:13] <Kambfhase> Darkstar1: please provide a fiddle
[10:44:37] <BadCodSmell> Is there not a patch or something for this bug?
[10:44:37] <Kambfhase> stockmania: yes, that is possible
[10:44:46] <DeltaHeavy> If I have a 'tr' in a selector, how would I select the following tr?
[10:45:11] <Mottie> DeltaHeavy: use .next()
[10:45:20] <Kambfhase> BadCodSmell: If you think its a bug please provide a jsfiddle test case
[10:45:31] <Kambfhase> ?next @ DeltaHeavy
[10:45:32] <bot-t> DeltaHeavy, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[10:45:40] <Darkstar1> Kambfhase: might have to be later.. It's almost home time for me
[10:45:50] <Kambfhase> Time for bed?
[10:46:00] <Darkstar1> Kambfhase: but I can link you the page :)

[10:46:14] <Kambfhase> :o
[10:46:15] <Darkstar1> time for both
[10:46:17] <stockmania> Mottie: figured it out, thanks for your help and time
[10:46:30] <stockmania> Kambfhase: figured it out, thanks for your help and time too
[10:46:31] <Kambfhase> just come back tomorrow
[10:46:56] <stockmania> Kambfhase: sleep is for noobs
[10:47:29] <Kambfhase> I've got Mate to handle that
[10:49:04] <brettster> hey guys
[10:49:38] <Nece228> gnarf: i implemented it in my code, it works, thanks!
[10:49:50] <Nece228> altough i still dont understand how it works, need to dig in
[10:50:22] <gnarf> Nece228: $( html ) will create DOM from an HTML string
[10:51:01] <gnarf> so $( "<span>" ) is just making a span element that you use to hold the place of one of the items while you put it in the place of the other, then you replace the placeholder with the other one
[10:52:19] <Mottie> Emil: try this: http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/c5ygL/

[11:33:39] <ArcaneWater> Hello, can someone help me what i am doing wrong here http://pastebin.com/P1sNW4Wh i want thath when user click on image with id slika it checks if is currently display minus.png then it changed to plus.png or vice versa.
[11:35:02] <raj> Cork, still here?
[11:36:35] <Cork> raj: yes and no :)
[11:36:45] <raj> :)
[11:37:20] <Cork> whats up?
[11:37:20] <raj> k, so Mr. Cork, I was wondering if you see a viable `data` key/attribute here: http://paste.ofcode.org/JchSkBsvKSP2GrRCFrm2Ur
[11:37:50] <Cork> sh
[11:37:52] <Cork> *ah
[11:38:05] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: you're missing a "#" in front of "#silka" for one.
[11:38:34] <Cork> raj: nope :/
[11:38:48] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: and you shouldn't rebind the click event every time
[11:39:03] <ArcaneWater> Mottie hey thanks i already found and fixed thath, but i found thath in html i always have src="./img/minus.png", how i can change thath ?
[11:39:16] <ArcaneWater> Mottie: so it goes from minus to plus but not from plus to minus
[11:39:33] <Mottie> sec
[11:40:24] <raj> Cork, so in conclusion, it's not possible to add a `key` onto the data object of all ajax requests?
[11:41:23] <raj> without explicitly adding it to each ajax request, or using a wrapped function for $.ajax
[11:41:59] <BillCriswell> Fuck. I just tried .explode() for like 10 minutes.
[11:42:14] <Cork> raj: not through an api no
[11:42:23] <Brodingo> ArcaneWater what you should really do is use a css sprite and .toggleClass()
[11:42:27] <Cork> raj: you would have to use a wrapper solution like we talked about before
[11:42:44] <Cork> raj: at least that's as far as i can tell
[11:42:56] <Cork> (and what i usually do my self)
[11:43:05] <ArcaneWater> Brodingo hmm no other way to do thath then css?
[11:43:19] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/74Wbw/
[11:43:21] <Brodingo> theres plenty of ways, but css is probably the best suited
[11:43:31] <Brodingo> one http request, instant change
[11:43:49] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: yeah changing the class name is MUCH easier as Brodingo suggests
[11:44:20] <Cork> raj: ajaxPrefilter is newer then when i made those functions though; so i really thought it would provide a clean hook for it; kinda disappointing that it doesn't
[11:44:47] <djQuery> ghmmm can't figure out where all my buttons are going http://jsbin.com/etawoy/3/edit
[11:44:54] <raj> Cork, is it that I hvaen't passed any data explicitly at the point that I put the debugger;?
[11:45:03] <BillCriswell> ArcaneWater: What Brodingo said for sure.  If you have to do it the other way this may help: http://jsbin.com/ufaxad/1/edit
[11:45:13] <djQuery> should have 4 buttons per li but only the first li is getting the buttons
[11:45:21] <djQuery> doh fingered it out
[11:45:23] <Cork> raj: could be
[11:45:39] <Cork> raj: try something like data: { test: 'works' }
[11:45:41] <Cork> or something
[11:46:14] <raj> ok
[11:47:00] <raj> Cork: `data: "test=works"`
[11:47:05] <raj> is what showed up
[11:47:13] <Cork> :s
[11:47:21] <raj> in `options`
[11:47:21] <Cork> so its already parameterized :/
[11:47:25] <Cork> thats a pitty
[11:47:41] <Cork> what about the originalOptions ?
[11:48:19] <raj> Cork, yes it's there
[11:48:25] <raj> as an object
[11:49:06] <Cork> so you could try something like options.data = $.params(originalOptions); after you've updated originalOptions
[11:50:06] <raj> originalOptions.data ?
[11:50:17] <Cork> gah i hate it when i type command line shortcuts in irc >_<
[11:50:20] <Cork> raj: ya
[11:50:59] <raj> $.ajaxPrefilter(function(options, originalOptions, jqxhr) {originalOptions.data.special = [1]}) still gives an error
[11:51:11] <raj> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'special' of undefined
[11:51:29] <raj> because I don't have a data attribute on the original ajax request
[11:51:34] <ArcaneWater> Mottie hmmm dont know why this script doesnt work ^^ I C/P and it nothing works ^^ Even other functions.
[11:51:34] <Cork> didn't you say originalOptions had data?
[11:51:40] <raj> yes
[11:51:55] <Cork> ah you mean it crashes if you don't send one?
[11:52:02] <raj> yes sir
[11:52:10] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: getting any errors in the console?

[11:53:22] <ArcaneWater> Mottie: i am using normal Text Editor ^^
[11:54:28] <BillCriswell> The award for most confusing navigation imaginable goes to...
[11:54:28] <ArcaneWater> Mottie: here is the complete script right now: http://jsfiddle.net/NRG8f/
[11:54:34] <Mottie> AracneWater: are you including jQuery?
[11:54:37] <djQuery> cant figure out why these don't looke like ui-buttons http://jsbin.com/etawoy/5/edit
[11:55:45] <ArcaneWater> Mottie: at jquery yes (<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.0/jquery.min.js"></script>)
[11:55:46] <BillCriswell> djQuery: Are you ever applying the class ui-button-text-only?
[11:55:59] <ArcaneWater> Mottie: i mean at HTML ^^
[11:56:17] <djQuery> BillCriswell, .buttonset should apply that
[11:56:50] <BillCriswell> djQuery: Oh.
[11:57:18] <BillCriswell>  djQuery: You're using css: 'test', shoudl that be "class":"test"?
[11:57:27] <djQuery> but they dont even look correct when applying just button to them http://jsbin.com/etawoy/6/edit
[11:57:56] <djQuery> BillCriswell, thanks for that catch but that still doesnt do it
[11:58:30] <BillCriswell> djQuery: You sure? Just tried it and they changed appearance drastically.
[11:58:51] <djQuery> yeppers now its workin
[11:58:51] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/etawoy/9/edit
[11:58:56] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: sorry, I had an extra ( in the code... get this update: http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/74Wbw/1/
[11:58:56] <BillCriswell> Sweeeeet.
[11:59:13] <BillCriswell> djQuery: That's something if I did it I'd never catch it. Extra eyes on things helps so much ahha.
[11:59:26] <djQuery> BillCriswell, trying to fix a performance related issue with buton
[12:00:02] <BillCriswell> djQuery: Have fun. :-D
[12:00:12] <djQuery> BillCriswell, yeppers, half the time just putting my mind fresh to it to have to explain it catches my error though
[12:00:43] <BillCriswell> djQuery: Yeah. I love when that happens. Especially before I hit enter.
[12:01:27] <BillCriswell> The next morning things click so quickly for me usually..
[12:01:40] <djQuery> well at 2000 buttons that is definetly taking a while
[12:02:13] <ArcaneWater> Mottie: thank you! Need one more thing connected with this if you can help me :)
[12:03:06] <BillCriswell> 2000 buttons would make me sad.
[12:04:40] <ArcaneWater> Mottie, now on this image i should use following: http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/ so when i press plus it shows and when i press minus it hides, what way should i approach this now?

[12:05:36] <BillCriswell> Writing CSS after writing SCSS doesn't happen easily
[12:06:10] <BillCriswell> CSS is the least DRY thing to work with haha.
[12:06:15] <dougb> hey all, I'm trying to set .prop, but for some reason it's not working.  You can see the function here: http://jsfiddle.net/rJjeg/ Line 14 is where I'm trying to set .prop checked to false
[12:07:24] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: can you share the HTML for that button and image
[12:08:11] <BillCriswell> dougb: There must be something else going on. that should work just fine.
[12:08:24] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/esuvuv/1/edit like so dougb.
[12:08:42] <djQuery> velcrobots, have you tried adding jquery ui to it? it ads a lot of easing effects to the show and hide
[12:08:51] <dougb> BillCriswell: that's why I'm confused.  I tried debugging with console.log and it's triggering that when data.type == 'error'
[12:08:56] <Es0teric> djQuery i am still working on that loop man
[12:08:56] <Es0teric> lol
[12:09:14] <djQuery> Es0teric, forget it
[12:09:16] <Es0teric> i found out i can use for to squeeze out the results i want
[12:09:23] <djQuery> Es0teric, use ul and li
[12:09:27] <Es0teric> i just need the formula
[12:09:28] <BillCriswell> dougb: What version of jQuery are you using?
[12:09:39] <Es0teric> djQuery slidesjs only uses <div>
[12:09:41] <ArcaneWater> Mottie: sure here: http://pastebin.com/7jeq2YSJ
[12:09:48] <BillCriswell> prop() didn't come about till 1.6
[12:09:53] <djQuery> Es0teric, jsut set the width of the ul to be 4* + a little to what you are making the images
[12:10:06] <dougb> BillCriswell: jQuery 1.8.3
[12:10:12] <Es0teric> djQuery like i said, i am using slidesjs
[12:10:13] <dougb> I'll try upgrading to 1.9, see if that works
[12:10:14] <djQuery> then set the ul\li to go across instead of down
[12:10:15] <BillCriswell> dougb: Ahh. Not sure then.
[12:10:16] <Es0teric> it doesnt work like that
[12:10:25] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: is the image attached to the "dodaj" button?
[12:10:30] <djQuery> slidejs wont work with lis?
[12:10:31] <BillCriswell> dougb: Oh wait.
[12:10:36] <Es0teric> djQuery no
[12:10:40] <BillCriswell> this isn't what you think it is.
[12:10:42] <Es0teric> it only works with <div> wrapped in <div>
[12:11:07] <ArcaneWater> Mottie: yes at default is attached to minus
[12:11:16] <djQuery> Es0teric, gimme link
[12:11:27] <Es0teric> djQuery -> http://slidesjs.com
[12:11:35] <ArcaneWater> Mottie: ups mistake image is only attached to img src
[12:11:47] <djQuery> Es0teric, lol see ?demo
[12:11:48] <bot-t> Es0teric, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:11:51] <Es0teric> oh
[12:11:57] <Es0teric> i didnt recreate that yet man
[12:12:04] <Es0teric> i just need the formula
[12:12:06] <Es0teric> once i have the formula
[12:12:10] <Es0teric> everything will be easy from there
[12:12:11] <djQuery> Es0teric, you got what I did yesterday?
[12:12:18] <Es0teric> djQuery yeah i tried to expand on it
[12:12:26] <djQuery> send it back
[12:12:50] <djQuery> var rows = t.length/4
[12:13:13] <BillCriswell> dougb: http://jsfiddle.net/rJjeg/2/ should work. this is no longer an "api" in an ajax call.
[12:13:27] <djQuery> rows = rows.toString().split('.')[0] drop off any remainder
[12:13:49] <Es0teric> djQuery i am trying to save the remainder
[12:13:57] <Es0teric> and put them in another div
[12:14:10] <BillCriswell> dougb: Also, the second parameter of $.get can have data passed to it, instead of string concatenation you could use that.
[12:14:10] <djQuery> rows = parseInt(rows ||0, 10)   convert back to a #
[12:14:25] <Es0teric> djQuery -> http://jsbin.com/idatev/5/
[12:14:28] <djQuery> var remainder = t.length - rows
[12:14:43] <dougb> BillCriswell: thank you! that worked perfectly
[12:14:47] <DeltaHeavy> What's the opposite of '.next'? I want to select something on element backwards.
[12:14:52] <DeltaHeavy> one*
[12:15:05] <BillCriswell> $.get('/sites/apiConnect', { url: value, id: id, type: type }, function(result){ // Foo });
[12:15:08] <djQuery> detha, see ?prev
[12:15:08] <bot-t> detha, .prev([selector]): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[12:15:10] <BillCriswell> dougb: No problem!
[12:15:21] <dougb> I guess I never tried accessing $(this) in an AJAX call, so I never ran into that issue.  Now I just upgraded to jQuery 1.9 and saw that .live was depreciated 2 versions ago, so I gotta update everything
[12:15:39] <BillCriswell> dougb: Yeah. No fun. :(
[12:15:40] <djQuery> DeltaHeavy see ?.prev
[12:15:40] <bot-t> .prev([selector]): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[12:15:51] <BillCriswell> dougb: .on() is snazzy though.
[12:15:56] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/74Wbw/2/
[12:16:23] <djQuery> Es0teric, did you understand that
[12:17:10] <Es0teric> djQuery yes, but again i am not trying to knock off any remainders
[12:17:13] <Es0teric> i want to keep the remainders
[12:17:30] <rzec> is there any reason why when clicking on a link inside a div, the div's click event would fire before the anchor click event?
[12:17:56] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: Oops again LOL... http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/74Wbw/3/   it's slideToggle, not toggleSlide
[12:19:04] <djQuery> Es0teric, http://jsbin.com/idatev/7/edit
[12:19:19] <djQuery> notice the if(remainder>0)
[12:20:22] <Es0teric> djQuery isnt the if(remainder > 0) supposed to be inside the while loop?
[12:21:22] <ArcaneWater> Mottie wow thanks it works but u connected to button, i changed to #table which is what should animate, but it does close and open but it does not animate like it did with button
[12:21:30] <velcrobots> djQuery - I was trying to avoid adding UI if I could.  Would animate() do it?
[12:21:31] <fonko> hey guys, how come i have an ajax call that has a "onSaveHistory" for "success:" and its actually a function that i have if you check my code. but is not being called as if it where a function
[12:21:51] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: just change the $dodaj to point to the table
[12:21:57] <BillCriswell> rzec: do you have a div inside the a?
[12:22:28] <rzec> BillCriswell: nope
[12:22:38] <ArcaneWater> Mottie yes, i already did thath, i said it closes and opens like it should, but it does not animate like it animates with button
[12:22:48] <velcrobots> djQuery - I actually got it nearly working with effects - still a little jumpy though: http://inspirawebdesign.us
[12:22:56] <Mottie> Es0teric: what is parse()?
[12:23:08] <BillCriswell> rzec: Hmmm... I'd need to see it.
[12:23:22] <Es0teric> Mottie what?
[12:23:23] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: wrap the table in a div, then animate that
[12:23:30] <djQuery> velcrobots, try telling it to go slow
[12:23:37] <Mottie> Es0teric: parse((t.length/4).toString().split('.')[0])
[12:23:37] <chovy> what does $.param() do? does it just convert { foo: bar} into foo=bar
[12:24:01] <djQuery> velcrobots, it should accpt 2 params the speed and the effect
[12:24:12] <djQuery> dont remember what order though
[12:24:12] <Es0teric> Mottie isnt it supposed to be parseInt() which it is?
[12:24:13] <Es0teric> o.O
[12:24:24] <velcrobots> djQuery: yes, I have "jQuery("#"+myID+"-label").show('slide', {direction: 'right'}, 200);"
[12:24:26] <djQuery> Es0teric, NOOOO
[12:24:30] <Mottie> Es0teric: no idea... you're parsing an array?
[12:24:42] <djQuery> you need another loop inside the if to get the remainder
[12:24:56] <Es0teric> ohhhhhh djQuery
[12:24:56] <Es0teric> ok
[12:25:21] <Es0teric> Mottie basically i am trying to loop through an array of objects and put every 4 items of the object in a new <div>
[12:25:31] <djQuery> 1 loop for getting full rows then another loop to get the last row
[12:25:34] <Es0teric> with remainders
[12:25:42] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: .slice() that shit up.
[12:25:48] <Mottie> djQuery: so where is parse() defined?
[12:26:10] <Es0teric> BillCriswell .slice()? what if there are remainders though?
[12:26:15] <fonko> hey guys, how come i have an ajax call that has a "onSaveHistory" for "success:" and its actually a function that i have if you check my code. but is not being called as if it where a function
[12:26:25] <BillCriswell> .slice() is wise enough to only grab what it can.
[12:26:27] <djQuery> hopefully extract the actual actual html creating to another function and just pass it the start and end
[12:26:49] <djQuery> BillCriswell, he is slicing in 4s
[12:27:49] <ArcaneWater> Mottie it works fantasticaly thanks!
[12:28:05] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: great! :)
[12:30:21] <Es0teric> BillCriswell also what if i have about 97 objects in an array, and i use .slice(0, 4) how would that work with what i want to achieve?
[12:31:38] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: http://jsbin.com/asujat/1/edit like this
[12:32:26] <djQuery> Es0teric, there thats a lot easier
[12:32:51] <djQuery> just throw them all in there without thier wrapper then wrap them with slice
[12:33:32] <devslash> im trying to figure something out. a page has a combobox where you select a date. $("#Date1").prop('value') returns the value of the selected item. how do i get the value of index 1 of the combobox ?
[12:34:00] <jrockjiggz> don't use prop('value) use val()
[12:34:08] <devslash> ok
[12:34:13] <devslash> well how do i get val for index 1 ?
[12:34:14] <djQuery> Es0teric, so is it 4 <a> per div or 1 <a> per div?
[12:34:22] <jrockjiggz> and you can $('select option:first').val()
[12:34:25] <jrockjiggz> uh
[12:34:30] <jrockjiggz> and you can $('select option:first').html()
[12:34:31] <jrockjiggz> uh
[12:34:33] <Es0teric> djQuery 4 <a> per div
[12:34:39] <djQuery> sec then
[12:34:40] <Mottie> fonko: could you share your code in a jsFiddle
[12:34:54] <devslash> that doesnt work
[12:34:58] <Es0teric> djQuery also, there should be <img> in each <a>
[12:35:31] <Es0teric> also, BillCriswell thanks, man... that was a wayy more simpler solution
[12:35:35] <devslash> jrockjiggz that doesnt work in firebug
[12:35:36] <Es0teric> lol
[12:36:08] <Mottie> devlash: Try $('#Date1 option:eq(1)').val()
[12:36:17] <StubbornTurtle> an HTTPS JSONP AJAX request is secure even if it is on a HTTP site, because the client is the one connecting directly to the HTTPS site, correct?
[12:36:32] <jrockjiggz> eq(0)
[12:36:33] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: I had the same issue not too long ago I was going nuts with it as well haha.
[12:36:40] <devslash> ok thanks that works
[12:36:42] <Es0teric> lol BillCriswell man
[12:36:45] <Es0teric> thats crazy
[12:36:52] <fonko> Mottie, sure
[12:37:33] <Es0teric> also BillCriswell, why add a /> inside the div?
[12:37:37] <Es0teric> does it indicate to self-close?
[12:37:37] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: I learned jQuery then JavaScript... it shoudl have been the other way around haha. There's a lot of really helpful things in vanilla JS I didn't want to touch at first cause I thougth it was the devil.
[12:37:48] <fonko> http://jsfiddle.net/vPKYM/
[12:37:49] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Yeah, you may not need to do that. Just a hobby I picked up.
[12:38:06] <Es0teric> a hobby?, BillCriswell
[12:38:07] <fonko> there you can see... on success its calling the function but without the listener
[12:38:15] <fonko> i mean... isn't that weird?
[12:38:28] <BillCriswell> JohnResig cured my JavaScriptPhobia
[12:38:40] <BillCriswell> a habit, sorry!
[12:38:44] <fonko> should onSaveHstoria knows that is going to have "data" as variable to be passed through?
[12:39:33] <Es0teric> BillCriswell ok just to make sure, it indicates to self close
[12:39:34] <Es0teric> right?
[12:39:42] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Yes... in my brain at least.
[12:39:49] <Es0teric> intresting
[12:40:14] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Works with or without it.
[12:40:37] <BillCriswell> I should look into it a bit more and see if there's anything drastically different happening.
[12:40:43] <BillCriswell> Doubt it, though.

[12:40:53] <Es0teric> nah, its the same shit
[12:40:56] <Es0teric> lol
[12:42:12] <BillCriswell> Good times.
[12:42:12] <guide_X> why might a jquery ajax call return a 500 error on a specific "item" and not the rest? I am not hitting the server on the specific item at all
[12:42:25] <Mottie> fonko: is the saveHistoria function being called? I think the problem might be fbuser properties might be another object within fbuser
[12:44:51] <Mottie> fonko: what I mean is when I get the sucess from an ajax call, it's usually something like this: success: function(result) { user = result ?  result.data.username : ''; }
[12:46:04] <Mottie> *crickets*
[12:49:31] <fonko> lol
[12:49:32] <fonko> sorry
[12:49:40] <Mottie> Mottie: wow, I totally read your code backwards... you're posting not getting LOL
[12:49:47] <fonko> Mottie, well i have tried to log something to the console
[12:49:51] <fonko> within the function
[12:49:52] <Mottie> I need caffeine
[12:49:54] <fonko> and nop... nothing
[12:50:03] <djQuery> Es0teric, here ya go http://jsbin.com/idatev/8/edit
[12:50:15] <Mottie> maybe the url is wrong?
[12:50:26] <fonko> wich one?
[12:50:29] <fonko> wich url?
[12:50:30] <djQuery> Es0teric, you just need to add the right clas to the inner div
[12:50:43] <fonko> url is ok
[12:50:45] <Es0teric> djQuery alright lemme check
[12:51:03] <Mottie> did you check the response from the server?
[12:51:36] <Es0teric> djQuery why put a img src in a anchor?
[12:51:54] <velcrobots> djQuery: added UI - can you take a look at this fiddle?  somethings off: http://jsfiddle.net/velcrobots/Z53yc/
[12:51:55] <djQuery> Es0teric, where was it supposed to go?
[12:52:04] <Es0teric> djQuery in a <img>
[12:52:45] <Es0teric> but i can just do $('<a>', {}).append($('<img>', {})).appendTo(), right? djQuery
[12:52:45] <djQuery> velcrobots, just increase the width to the thing and it looks good
[12:52:55] <fonko> Mottie, yup... and its a 500 error... but that can be because im using yii framework, i need to check if im getting all the data that i expect to save to db
[12:53:13] <djQuery> Es0teric, just change <a> to <img />
[12:53:28] <Es0teric> djQuery i need <img> in the <a>
[12:53:45] <djQuery> Es0teric, sure then
[12:55:08] <velcrobots> djQuery: but remove the effects from the show() function and it fits.  what does UI do that changes that?
[12:55:55] <djQuery> ?ui.effects
[12:55:56] <bot-t> djQuery, UI/Effects - jQuery Wiki - This is the core dependency of the effects of jQuery UI. This file is needed by all other effects and can also be used stand-alone. Please note that ui.core.js is not a dependency for the effects t... http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects
[12:56:08] <djQuery> velcrobots, ^^^^^^^^^

[12:56:34] <bot-t> djQuery, UI/Effects/Slide - jQuery Wiki - Slides the element out of the viewport. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Slide
[12:58:47] <djQuery> this ones pretty cool dont know what I would ever use it for http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Transfer
[12:58:52] <ArcaneWater> Mottie one more help please, now i am doing local storage http://pastebin.com/QG90YYj0 and you can see that i use localStorage.removeItem(".rdeca"); but thath does not actualy delete it from localStorage what should i use instead of class .rdeca?
[12:59:27] <djQuery> ArcaneWater, are periods allowed in key names for local storage?
[12:59:46] <djQuery> or at least at the start of them?
[13:00:35] <Mottie> djQuery: it looks like it works
[13:00:53] <djQuery> Mottie, what works?
[13:01:08] <Mottie> having a period in the localStorage key
[13:01:13] <djQuery> cool
[13:01:24] <Mottie> just tested it in Chrome
[13:01:47] <ArcaneWater> Uhm periods? Dont realy understand ^^
[13:01:53] <djQuery> mottie saying it works in chrome is not the same as saying it works lol
[13:02:10] <Mottie> I know, that's why I specificied, in Chrome LOL
[13:02:37] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: you were saying that you are using the class name... it starts with a period
[13:03:50] <djQuery> ArcaneWater, what browser are u using?
[13:04:16] <djQuery> ArcaneWater, would it be better to ask in the hmtl5 irc as they might have more peeps experienced with local storage
[13:04:38] <ArcaneWater> djQuery i use chrome too ^^, is the html5 irc on freenode too?
[13:04:47] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: I don't see you removing the value... I see this: localStorage.podatki¬†=¬†"";
[13:05:14] <Mottie> that just sets it to an empty string, but doesn't completely remove it
[13:05:43] <djQuery> Es0teric, http://jsbin.com/idatev/10/edit
[13:05:47] <ArcaneWater> Mottie look at $("#odstrani").click(function() there i call remove
[13:06:18] <Mottie> that's a different value: localStorage.removeItem(vrstica);
[13:06:32] <ArcaneWater> I tryed like localStorage.removeItem(".rdeca");	
[13:06:41] <ArcaneWater> But does not work.
[13:07:01] <Mottie> Try localStorage.removeItem("podatki");¬†¬†
[13:07:17] <Es0teric> djQuery just saw that, thanks
[13:07:42] <djQuery> Es0teric, no thank the other guy that gave a better slice
[13:07:57] <Es0teric> yeah, i did
[13:07:59] <Es0teric> lol
[13:08:44] <djQuery> Es0teric, dont know why the last one doesnt show the img
[13:09:23] <whatever_42> hey guys. when i update my page via ajax my previous scripts do not apply to the new content. is there a way to avoid this behaviour?
[13:09:38] <Es0teric> yeah, ill fix that, djQuery
[13:09:45] <djQuery> oh the object doesnt have a url
[13:10:02] <ArcaneWater> Mottie localStorage.removeItem("podatki");  remove complete list, not only the marked ones.
[13:10:21] <djQuery> and yo probably want to change the name of the <a> class
[13:11:06] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: sorry, I didn't understand the difference... which list are you trying to remove?
[13:11:39] <ArcaneWater> Mottie i am trying to remove the one which gets marked with method Oznaci
[13:11:44] <djQuery> Es0teric, now it doesnt need a class http://jsbin.com/idatev/11/edit
[13:13:31] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: localStorage can only save strings, I think you're trying to save a jQuery object in there... or just the string name?
[13:13:59] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: Oh wait! You don't even have "vrstica" defined inside the click function
[13:14:03] <ArcaneWater> Mottie just a string
[13:14:22] <djQuery> Es0teric, if you set the width of the contaier and just turned on pagnation wouldt it give the same effect
[13:14:57] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: is $("#odstrani") inside the row that is removed?
[13:15:53] <djQuery> anyone ever used fontawsome with ui.button?
[13:16:03] <ArcaneWater> Mottie #odstrani is only the button, and its not defined anywhere else
[13:16:49] <Mottie> but it is inside of the $("#dodaj") click function and rebound to click each time... it'd be better to move it outside of that function
[13:17:03] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: ugh nm
[13:19:52] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: ok try this: http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/55zGz/
[13:20:22] <Emil> using some jquery animations. new to javascript. are the animations running asynchronously? thus, if i react to an event, might the animation run concurrently as my event handler executes?
[13:24:54] <ArcaneWater> Mottie nope it does not remove.
[13:26:11] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: ok, no where in the code do I see where vrstica is added to localStorage
[13:26:12] <ArcaneWater> Mottie i belive i should read the html of this line and save it somehow to string and then remove thath string for localStorage
[13:26:42] <ArcaneWater> Mottie it isnt, to localStorage is added string: localStorage.podatki = localStorage.podatki + str;
[13:27:00] <ArcaneWater> and str is the string of the vrstica(line) of table <td.....
[13:27:10] <Mottie> o.O
[13:27:51] <Mottie> I see now... wow that's a mess. What exactly are you trying to do? And you know localStorage isn't unlimited
[13:28:46] <whatever_42> no ideas?
[13:29:14] <ArcaneWater> Mottie yes i know, but i am using it for small listl not anything big, i am trying to save that table records which i done sucesfully but now need to configure thath it will remove them too.
[13:29:59] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: then I think the best thing would be to save each row into an array, turn that into a string and add that to local storage
[13:30:30] <Mottie> whatever_42: you'll need to use ?on() and follow the method that delegates events
[13:30:31] <bot-t> whatever_42, .on() | jQuery API Documentation - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:30:57] <raj> Cork, it doesn't add those variables
[13:31:00] <raj> :(
[13:31:09] <ArcaneWater> Mottie hmmm, but adding is fine it seems ^^ but removing is not :D
[13:31:32] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: adding is easy, removing specific portions is hard
[13:32:08] <Mottie> ArcaneWater: look at this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3357553/how-to-store-an-array-in-localstorage
[13:35:57] <mboro> I'm using $.when to bundle three ajax calls. this works as expected if all requests are successful. if one of the requests fails, however, my "always" method fires right away instead of waiting for all three to complete. why is that?
[13:38:43] <djQuery> mboro, sounds correct to me
[13:39:20] <mboro> djQuery: it might be correct behavior but is there any way to do what I describe?
[13:39:36] <mboro> I want to make sure all three requests complete before continuing successful or not
[13:40:39] <djQuery> 5 seconds to create 2000 buttons
[13:41:43] <ArcaneWater> Motti tryed with arrays ^^ Messed even more lol xD
[13:41:46] <djQuery> mboro, then put a test in failure to see if the other ones have finished
[13:42:56] <whatever_42> so like the solution shown here? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9426149/jquery-selector-not-working-on-content-loaded-through-ajax
[13:44:43] <djQuery> anyone got an example of ui.buttonset with icons
[13:45:50] <jost> Can anyone recommend me a JavaScript CMS? Preferably based on jQuery. No server side computing is possible, so it has to be pure JS.
[13:46:12] <BillCriswell> jost: Oh boy.
[13:46:59] <jost> BillCriswell: :-)
[13:47:05] <jost> whats the matter?
[13:47:09] <systemfault> It's not possible.
[13:48:22] <jost> it should be possible... not much is available: Uploads, HTTP-Authentication, static file delivery. That should be enough... ?
[13:48:33] <systemfault> You said "NO SERVER-SIDE"
[13:48:50] <BillCriswell> No server means no website.
[13:48:52] <systemfault> No server side = no server persistance = no cms
[13:49:23] <BillCriswell> There's nothing to *serve* the site.
[13:49:29] <jost> yes, no php, perl, ruby, what ever. Only a simple HTTP-Server that can serve static files. Which may be uploaded by HTTP.
[13:49:30] <systemfault> jost: I haven't seen generic ones yet‚Ä¶
[13:49:47] <systemfault> I've done 2 in the past‚Ä¶ proprietary
[13:49:57] <systemfault> And they were project-specific :/
[13:50:52] <jost> Building a project specific CMS is what I'm trying to avoid... no need to invent the wheel again.
[13:51:28] <BillCriswell> jost: Do you expect javascript to create static files for you to serve?
[13:52:14] <HankToTheHendrix> A: position absolute div with a z-index of 1000. B: position absolute div with a z-index of 1005. A shows ontop of B but WHY!??
[13:52:30] <djQuery> every cms I have seen needs a database of some sort, no server means no db connection
[13:53:20] <systemfault> BillCriswell: Seems that he really wants to only have an API on the server.
[13:53:27] <ryanneufeld> HankToTheHendrix: go and watch this http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/110-quick-overview-of-css-position-values/
[13:53:33] <systemfault> BillCriswell: No views are constructed server-side
[13:53:59] <BillCriswell> Sounds like a lot of trouble that $10 a month can save.
[13:53:59] <jost> yes, with some JS-Based Editor for example... Take the input from the editor, create the content for one file from it and upload that. Then access the file via AJAX.
[13:54:45] <jost> BillCriswell, it is a site that should be served by an embedded device. Not much computing power...
[13:55:40] <chilversc> jost: you need some server side component to A, serve the files (that is a computation), and B receive the uploads
[13:56:01] <jost> chilversc, these components are there. But not much more.
[13:56:18] <jost> HTTP-Auth for a backend is also available
[13:56:22] <chilversc> jost: so, you're going to need a web server, which now only leaves the upload part, and I bet there's a module for say apache that allows PUT requests to update a static file
[13:56:35] <chilversc> jost: at that part its simple, a http PUT request using ajax
[13:56:40] <chilversc> s/part/point/
[13:57:44] <systemfault> I think that the server-side api + client-side JS views is the future :P
[13:57:57] <chilversc> jost: so yeah, looks possible, here's one that use a small script to handle PUT requests http://www.apacheweek.com/features/put
[13:58:09] <chilversc> jost: and then you just need the same, but for DELETE requests
[13:58:35] <chilversc> jost: though that's quite old, so like I said, might be a module that comes with apache to handle it these days
[13:58:58] <BillCriswell> systemfault: I'm still horrified of the user having JS turned off haha.
[13:59:02] <jost> chilversc, Apache doesn't matter, as apache can't be used.
[13:59:17] <jost> but put and delete-requests should be possible.
[13:59:19] <systemfault> BillCriswell: I'm terrified at not having SEO at all.
[13:59:38] <systemfault> BillCriswell: I couldn't care less about the .1% of the users not having JS enabled.
[14:00:00] <BillCriswell> systemfault: I know it's so little but it still bothers me. I think it's just from back in the day when those numbers were higher.
[14:00:13] <tfitts> Like IE5
[14:00:38] <chilversc> jost: right, but the server software needs to handle the PUT/DELETE, and currently by default they do not, and need an extra module to enable it
[14:00:39] <systemfault> BillCriswell: I think that most websites should be "usable (even in a degraded state)" without JS
[14:00:52] <BillCriswell> systemfault: Agreed.
[14:03:14] <jost> chilversc, so, the question is: Is there a ready-to-use CMS, which is able to do something like this?
[14:03:39] <jost> Maybe after the user provides some compatibility-layer for the communication details, so storing data in JSON-files instead of HTML(-fragments) or whatever would become possible
[14:03:58] <jost> Does anyone know such a thing and feels like recommending it?
[14:04:12] <chilversc> jost: but now you're looking at server side processing that you specifically said wasn't allowed?
[14:04:25] <jost> chilversc, why? JSON?
[14:05:13] <jost> the compatibility layer would be in JS itself, of course
[14:05:29] <chilversc> jost: ah right, you're navigating, and combining the fragments client side, rather than having the server assemble the complete page
[14:06:57] <chilversc> jost: not familure with webdav, but would that enable your PUT/DELETE as standard, simple http methods?
[14:11:03] <jost> chilversc, probably not supported... as said, the server is a proprietary server running on an embedded device, and can't be changed. I don't know the exact capabilities, but uploading and deleting files is possible. Maybe not via HTTP PUT/DELETE, but in some other way.
[14:11:56] <chilversc> jost: hmm, that would make it a lot more difficult, or next to impossible using a standard browser unless that other way is http based
[14:12:05] <systemfault> If a webserver doesn't support PUT/DELETE then it's total crap.
[14:12:19] <chilversc> jost: if it is http based, you just have to match your ajax requests to what ever their API is
[14:12:34] <chilversc> systemfault: how so? many webservers are read-only and don't allow those verbs by default?
[14:12:50] <mythril> Is there a class I can add to make a button appear disabled?
[14:12:57] <systemfault> chilversc: Sure, but you can easily enable them with a config option‚Ä¶ which is just fine.
[14:13:09] <chilversc> mythril: you could set it to be disabled?
[14:13:31] <chilversc> systemfault: well, normally you either need a module for the server, or to direct those verbs to a custom script to handle them
[14:13:33] <systemfault> PUT and DELETE are basic HTTP verbs‚Ä¶ they're nothing fancy
[14:13:41] <mythril> chilversc: link button
[14:14:16] <jost> chilversc, exactly, thats where the compatibility layer comes in. It should be possible to register a "delete", "store" and an "update" callback to the CMS, which it then uses to manipulate its data. These Callbacks would be implemented to abstract from the used server.
[14:14:17] <systemfault> I've personally used PUT and DELETE on apache without issues.
[14:14:41] <chilversc> mythril: nope, you'll have to make one
[14:15:00] <chilversc> jost: right, but that requires server side processing, which you just said wasn't allowed?
[14:15:07] <jost> so if DELETE/PUT are not available, use whatever is available. Maybe something crazy like using (T)FTP.
[14:15:13] <systemfault> PUT was shit to deal with.. you had to fopen php://input
[14:15:20] <systemfault> Perhaps it's better now.
[14:15:32] <chilversc> jost: yeah, you won't be having TFTP or FTP using ajax, so what ever it is needs to be http based
[14:15:45] <chilversc> systemfault: not in PHP, its pretty easy in many other languages though
[14:16:02] <jost> these callbacks would be in javascript. And a FTP/TFTP Client could be build in JS...
[14:16:11] <systemfault> chilversc: Right, was staightforward the last time I use spring mvc (java)
[14:17:23] <chilversc> systemfault: though the php one isn't too bad, iirc, you can just get_file_contents("php://input"), wrap that in a function and forget about it
[14:18:15] <systemfault> I didn't think of using file_get_contents at the time..
[14:18:55] <chilversc> jost: you can't build an FTP client in JS that runs in the browser
[14:19:48] <chilversc> jost: hmm, except maybe using web sockets
[14:20:10] <systemfault> There's not a ton of ways‚Ä¶ you can do it the shit way with GET/POST.. or you make your api a little bit closer to REST and use verbs.
[14:20:18] <systemfault> s/verbs/all the verbs
[14:20:47] <chilversc> ah no, websockets also need http
[14:21:53] <chilversc> jost: so you're going to need to have some support on the server side for this to handle the PUT/DELETE requests, or a custom set of server side scripts that can handle sending data to them and storing it
[14:21:59] <chilversc> jost: there's no way around that requirement
[14:23:18] <jost> Hmm, ok... lets assume PUT/DELETE is possible. Is there any nice JS-CMS doing something like this? I've found some when googling, but maybe someone can recommend one?
[14:24:19] <chilversc> jost: problem there, is at some point you're users will want a search function over the content?
[14:24:32] <jost> probably not
[14:24:58] <chilversc> jost: I pretty much only use search these days, I don't even know where half my content is, only what keywords I'm looking for
[14:28:07] <jost> chilversc, there is not so much content that a search is needed. If it was, even that could be solved by JS, building the index with JS and store it to a file. Would not be as fast and usable as a server side search engine, but could work.
[14:29:10] <jost> The server would probably start to glow red when building an index anyway.
[14:31:37] <chilversc> jost: dunno about pre-made client side apps though I'm afraid
[14:36:26] <keebler> Any way to prevent multiple $.post() events when a button is assigned a .click(), and the back button is used?
[14:36:41] <happyface> $.ajax is always printing 500 errors in the console. How can I suppress the printing of 500 errors?
[14:37:24] <keebler> Can't tell if that's sarcasm.
[14:38:17] <keebler> if it makes any difference, I'm using jquery 1.6.4
[14:38:42] <systemfault> keebler: make a switch‚Ä¶ with a boolean
[14:40:39] <keebler> I have an if statement that is supposed to set the flag to false on exit.  The function never double submits if I never use the back button, which uses $.mobile.changePage($("#mobileapp")
[14:41:22] <systemfault> I never used jquery mobile‚Ä¶ but what I told you is what I would have done with normal jquery
[14:43:43] <toddWork_> in a php file, can i have an ajax url to itself? if so, how?
[14:44:13] <happyface> toddWork_, what does that even mean
[14:44:28] <toddWork_> imagine, if you will, you are in a php file
[14:44:34] <tomasm-> does anyone know if there is a plugin or a way to have jquery scrape a web page for possible images to use, such as with facebook prompting you for a picture (from a list of several, based on the webpage) when you type in a link? I'm not sure if this is possible with pure jquery or if there needs to be a backend (php) to fetch the content and then extract the <img> tags
[14:44:41] <toddWork_> then, in a <script> tag,. . .
[14:44:45] <toddWork_> you have an ajax call.
[14:45:01] <toddWork_> and i want the url to point to the very same file.
[14:46:05] <toddWork_> i can do the 'page.php' but i'm wondering if there is a <php self ?> or something.
[14:46:16] <toddWork_> and, asking to avoid any roadblocks.
[14:46:31] <toddWork_> i just talked myself through it! thanks tomasm-
[14:47:43] <Es0teric> did someone ping me?

[14:53:56] <Evan_Donovan> i'm trying to use benalman's jquery postmessage plugin but am getting the folowing error "Uncaught Error: SYNTAX_ERR: DOM Exception 12"
[14:54:05] <Evan_Donovan> does anyone know what might trigger that and how i can respond?
[14:54:25] <Evan_Donovan> by respond i mean, how i can get the plugin to work properly
[14:55:40] <Evan_Donovan> in firebug it says "SyntaxError: An invalid or illegal string was specified"
[14:56:59] <mythril> nm, I guess that's how it works
[15:04:15] <TelFiRE> var newHeight = $(this).find('div.front').height() + 'px';  --- I am getting a completely inaccurate value that is totally wrong and way too small, any ideas?
[15:08:33] <jrajav> Well, are you getting the right div?
[15:10:12] <micz123> hello, anyone here knows how to catch modernizr results to send to jquery ajax post?
[15:11:46] <micz123> hello, anyone here knows how to catch modernizr results to send to jquery ajax post?
[15:14:05] <TelFiRE> jrajav: yes it's the only div.front in the element
[15:14:21] <systemfault> micz123: I guess you could 1) get the class attribute value of the html Node‚Ä¶ 2) serialize the Modernizr object to json
[15:14:34] <jrajav> TelFiRE: Well, are you sure that it's the right element, then?
[15:14:38] <jrajav> 'this' can be nasty
[15:15:14] <TelFiRE> I mean the values it is getting are insane
[15:15:16] <jrajav> I'm just throwing curveballs here, by the way, I've never encountered a similar issue with .height() :P
[15:15:17] <TelFiRE> they are totally arbitrary
[15:15:22] <micz123> systemfault this is what i got from modernizr docs: It creates a JavaScript object (named Modernizr) that contains the results of these tests as boolean properties... But honestly im new at this, i dont know how to catch that
[15:15:32] <jrajav> I would debug it and inspect all the relevant values
[15:15:49] <jrajav> Particularly the two jQuery objects in question - $(this), and the div.front
[15:15:57] <jrajav> Just to sanity check that they're the right one
[15:16:37] <TelFiRE> jrajav: literally just ran the exact same command in console, and it gets the correct value
[15:16:59] <jrajav> Then I would *definitely* look at 'this' closely
[15:17:07] <systemfault> micz123: Yeah, that would me my "2)"
[15:17:19] <liam> I am trying to use query balloon. What I want to do is show the balloon when a user clicks on an element and the balloon is not visible. But while the balloon is visible if the user clicks anywhere else on the page including the element I want to hide the balloon. I have a simple example here http://jsfiddle.net/R4xKg/ anyone know how to do this with this plugin?
[15:17:49] <systemfault> micz123: It creates a Modernizr global variable‚Ä¶ so you could simply JSON.stringify it (it would kill any function on it)
[15:18:36] <micz123> systemfault whaat do u mean by kill any function on it?
[15:19:03] <systemfault> micz123: JSON.stringify doesn't serialize functions as they're not valid in JSON
[15:19:15] <liam> here is a better example: http://jsfiddle.net/R4xKg/1/
[15:20:22] <TelFiRE> Here is my js... You can see that unless I'm going crazy, these two calculations should be identical. http://pastebin.com/Bbcv99BX
[15:20:59] <TelFiRE> no other jquery running to affect the heights of these so it's not a load stack issue
[15:26:43] <zfly9> Hey guys is there any simple example of setting a cookie on a user on their first page load and how to check for that cookie? Basically using a 3rd party video embed and looking to only play on first load so I'd like to use this mehtod
[15:29:56] <Whirl3d_> Can I make certain elements within jquery UI sortable so they don't move? I don't want all the Li elements within a ul to move
[15:30:14] <snql> xz
[15:30:17] <hateIE> does any one know an alternative to arctext.js ?
[15:31:26] <Whirl3d_> nvm I found it
[15:31:29] <hateIE> http://unitystreams.com/zen-player/play2.html <-- as you can see arctext.js is a bit crumby
[15:31:46] <chovy> is it posible to clear the console in js?
[15:34:16] <Rchristiani> Chovy: console.clear() ?
[15:37:00] <TelFiRE> So I literally ran the exact same bit of code, 100% verbatim (changing $ to jQuery) and it does it correctly and works as expected. :(
[15:37:05] <TelFiRE> in the console
[15:37:11] <TelFiRE> but not in the js file, it gets totally wrong values there
[15:41:08] <zfly9> Hey guys is there any simple example of setting a cookie on a user on their first page load and how to check for that cookie? Basically using a 3rd party video embed and looking to only play on first load so I'd like to use this mehtod
[15:56:23] <TelFiRE> why why why!!! :( this is absolutely nuts! I can run a command in the console and it does it right, on a js file it does not! There is absolutely no rhyme or reason for this! The values it's obtaining make NO SENSE! NOTHING in the entire DOCUMENT has these height values!!!
[15:58:20] <chovy> Rchristiani: that doesn't work in chrome
[15:58:32] <chovy> Object #<Console> has no method 'clear'
[15:58:47] <Mottie> hateIE: http://csswarp.eleqtriq.com/
[16:01:10] <Mottie> TelFiRE: I've had that issue before... it's usually ended up being different versions of jQuery were running
[16:01:22] <rfish> hey, is there a utility similar to jQuery for json objects
[16:02:04] <Rchristiani> Chovy: Sorry, just use clear()
[16:02:06] <chovy> rfish: what would this utility do for json objects?
[16:02:39] <rfish> chovy: take a look at jsonselect http://jsonselect.org/#overview
[16:02:48] <chovy> Rchristiani: Uncaught ReferenceError: clear is not defined
[16:02:59] <Rchristiani> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3011600/clear-javascript-console-in-google-chrome
[16:02:59] <chovy> i'm trying to clear the consoel from my code
[16:03:23] <rfish> chovy: I like this funcionality but I was want to do event binding like jquery does
[16:03:41] <Rchristiani> oh sorry, seems you can't cal it from outside the console
[16:04:07] <chovy> rfish: not sure i understand
[16:04:49] <chovy> console.log(""*10000)
[16:04:53] <chovy> heh
[16:04:55] <rfish> when in jquery you can do something like $('#textbox').change(function (e) { 'blah' });
[16:05:28] <Rchristiani> Seems like Canary has console.clear()
[16:05:58] <rfish> I want to do something like $('object#objectId:attribute').change(funciton (e) { })
[16:06:09] <chovy> Rchristiani: what is canary?
[16:06:22] <Rchristiani> Chrome Canary

[16:06:55] <Rchristiani> also you can call console.clear and it will clear the console in fire fox
[16:07:53] <chovy> i'm moving away from ff to chrome
[16:08:24] <Rchristiani> Well maybe pick up Canary so you can use some of the new features, like console.clear()!
[16:09:11] <mhn23> intersting
[16:09:26] <mhn23> interesting*
[16:11:45] <chovy> Rchristiani: thanks. i will think about it. I just got all the extensions installed for chrome.
[16:18:36] <sunbeam> hi, i'd like to include a vimeo video to a private page
[16:18:52] <sunbeam> this vimeo video is password protected, however I do want it to display without the user having to fill in the password
[16:18:56] <sunbeam> does anyone know how this works?
[16:38:59] <mouses> do you guys optimize your code by doing that variable scrambling, line space removing, comment removing thing?
[16:39:54] <cusco> no, but I read somehwere that we should
[16:39:59] <cusco> I will next time
[16:40:12] <mouses> do some people do that to prevent code theft?
[16:40:37] <mouses> you know what i mean? like changing semantic variables to "a" and stuff
[16:41:26] <cusco> https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/
[16:41:39] <coldhead> also jsmin and uglify
[16:41:50] <coldhead> but that's to make the site faster, not to prevent code theft
[16:42:00] <coldhead> deobfuscation is trivial
[16:42:09] <cusco> http://yui.github.com/yuicompressor/
[16:42:14] <coldhead> you can't prevent people stealing your JS and nor should you try to
[16:42:18] <coldhead> it's a fool's errand
[16:42:21] <cusco> if the beowser can read , the user can read
[16:45:11] <micz123> hi, anyone knows how big is the filesize of jquery ui? i downloaded it and it is 2.4mb..??
[16:46:25] <micz123> is that for real..??
[16:47:07] <mouses> if somebody wants to steal my code and it's minimized, that person would probably not waste time trying to figure it out
[16:48:07] <Ziggy`> minimized code, never heard of that before..
[16:48:25] <coldhead> micz123: that probably includes the min and unminified versions plus the themes and images
[16:48:59] <micz123> coldhead alrdy looked inside... there is a development-bundle
[16:49:04] <Ziggy`> mouses: but I except minimized -> minified.
[16:49:08] <micz123> coldhead alrdy looked inside... there is a development-bundle folder
[16:49:39] <Ziggy`> s/except/expect
[16:50:23] <mouses> so do you guys care at all about code theft? i mean do u remove comments or anything?
[16:50:45] <coldhead> i minify to reduce filesize
[16:50:55] <coldhead> and i concatenate my scripts so there is only a single request
[16:50:58] <mouses> putting 1000 hours of work into your js for a badass site and then letting the world have at the code... any of you hate that?
[16:51:19] <tw2113> do you floss though, coldhead ?
[16:51:20] <coldhead> but i would never be so mean spirited or egotistical to think "THIS CODE IS PERFECT, NO ONE SHALL HAVE IT"
[16:51:47] <coldhead> mouses: we're using jQuery which is hundreds of thousands of free hours
[16:51:49] <coldhead> give back
[16:51:50] <tw2113> i'm so fine with letting others see/use my code, i WTFPL it
[16:52:08] <tw2113> screw the GPL
[16:52:47] <mouses> yeah i wasnt sure how others felt
[16:52:51] <kerozene> mouses: do you encrypt your github repos?
[16:52:58] <mouses> i dont care that much, i was just wondering
[16:53:14] <coldhead> i will basically break people's fingers if i find them trying to hoard their precious codes
[16:53:22] <mouses> i'm only working on a simple artist site, not the next twitter
[16:53:26] <tw2113> that's plans for day 2 coldhead
[16:53:28] <coldhead> exactly
[16:53:39] <kerozene> 1000 hours into a simple artist site?
[16:53:54] <mouses> never said i put 1000 hours into mine
[16:53:59] <coldhead> if you spend 1000 hours on a site then hey, you have a cool site
[16:54:08] <coldhead> why not get the most good out of all that work that you can
[16:54:22] <coldhead> open web and all that
[16:54:46] <tw2113> i never did find the pull tab on the web...i can't open it!
[16:54:49] <tw2113> why god why
[16:54:52] <AtomicDog> Can someone tell me why $('#element').remove() isn't working?
[16:54:59] <tw2113> oh wait, here's a kids safety cap to the web
[16:55:15] <tw2113> nooooo i can't figure out the safety cap
[16:55:15] <chovy> anyone know how i can trigger a jqXhr.fail?
[16:55:29] <chovy> i don't have access to the api
[16:56:11] <kerozene> tw2113: you have to pinch the sides and then it screws right off
[16:56:19] <tw2113> ohhhhhh
[16:58:19] <fission6> does jqueyr convert a json value of "1" to a number  /  int or a string
[16:58:53] <Ziggy`> I'm guessing a string, why not simply test it out.
[16:59:29] <Ziggy`> fission6: Just check the type..

[18:30:40] <dblosevn> yep yep
[18:34:18] <RA3OR> i have a few forms in a page, calling $("form").serialize(); in a function serializes all forms data, how can i serialize per form ?
[18:34:45] <RA3OR> something like $("#formIDhere").serialize(); ?
[18:34:46] <coldhead> use a more specific selector than $('form')
[18:34:50] <EPIK> give the form an id and change your selector
[18:34:55] <RA3OR> doesnt work
[18:35:02] <coldhead> or use each() and you can deal with the forms individually
[18:35:17] <RA3OR> forms have id's
[18:36:39] <AtomicDog> CAn anyone please tell me what to look at to determine why a simple $('#element').remove() isnt working?
[18:38:16] <RA3OR> http://privatepaste.com/316a1c137c
[18:38:37] <dblosevn> make sure one that $('#element') exists also make sure that line is actually beinng executed, put a console.log('remove element1') above it
[18:39:04] <AtomicDog> It does
[18:39:08] <AtomicDog> Yep
[18:39:35] <AtomicDog> console.log($('#element'), ' <-- removing that');
[18:39:52] <dblosevn> hmm
[18:40:01] <dblosevn> weird that should work
[18:40:58] <AtomicDog> then  $('#element').remove(); then console.log($('#element'), ' still effing here');
[18:41:04] <AtomicDog> I know, right?
[18:41:23] <AtomicDog> I wonder ...
[18:41:28] <AtomicDog> I have an idear
[18:42:22] <AtomicDog> $(body).append('<div id="overlay" style="opacity:0.001; background-color:#000; width:100%; height:100%; z-index:10; top:0; left:0; position:fixed;">&nbsp;</div>');
[18:42:22] <AtomicDog>   		
[18:42:34] <AtomicDog> That's what I'm using to create it, is that maybe doing something weird?
[18:42:52] <RA3OR> which of $("#formIDhere").serialize(); or $($('#formIDhere')).serialize(); ? both work
[18:42:57] <AtomicDog> Oh .. I think I get it
[18:43:56] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's all take 5
[18:44:23] <RA3OR> anyone?
[18:45:28] <coldhead> the first one, RA3OR
[18:45:33] <coldhead> the one that means less typing
[18:45:53] <RA3OR> is there a similar function to ucfirst ?
[18:46:17] <coldhead> no
[18:46:20] <coldhead> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1026069/capitalize-the-first-letter-of-string-in-javascript
[18:46:26] <coldhead> you can write one easily though!
[18:46:50] <RA3OR> i was looking at http://phpjs.org/functions/lcfirst/
[18:47:06] <RA3OR> http://phpjs.org/functions/ucfirst/
[18:47:07] <RA3OR> sorry
[18:47:07] <RA3OR> :D
[18:48:47] <AtomicDog> coldhead: haha
[18:48:58] <AtomicDog> Load a bowl of greens I'll take a break!
[18:49:30] <coldhead> yes you can use that RA3OR
[18:49:41] <coldhead> if your problem is that JS isn't enough like PHP that fixes it for you
[18:50:03] <AtomicDog> Thank god for that
[18:50:20] <AtomicDog> Of the languages I know, php is my least favorite
[18:51:29] <RobW> AtomicDog: why?
[18:51:35] <Whirl3d_> so in working with nested UL elements and .sortable() I can drag an outer element into an inner element, but not the other way around. Is it possible to keep the outer elements out of the inner elements when dropping?
[18:51:51] <RA3OR> '#form'.ucfirst(whatFor); bahahah nice concat
[18:51:51] <RA3OR> :D
[18:52:22] <RobW> Whirl3d_ maybe check the parent
[18:52:48] <AtomicDog> The only thing that it's better at than the alternatives available for it is making non programmers able to hack out something that works.
[18:53:04] <RA3OR> $(formID).serialize(); <-- case insensitive?
[18:53:12] <RA3OR> or just windoze
[18:53:53] <AtomicDog> selectors are usually case insensitive afaik
[18:54:36] <RA3OR> man... /grr
[18:55:06] <RobW> jquery attribute selectors are case sensitive though
[19:02:55] <raj> why is jquery so bad at handling full html files that include all tags?
[19:18:47] <sasori> how to select the body background in jquery ?
[19:25:55] <AtomicDog> dblosevn: Hey homie, it was because I have a div with the id of #body
[19:26:04] <AtomicDog> So the dom was getting fucked up
[19:26:15] <AtomicDog> $(body) != $('body')
[19:26:21] <AtomicDog> $(body) != $('#body')
[19:26:23] <AtomicDog> I mean
[19:37:22] <dblosevn> nice lol
[19:46:03] <coldhead> good chat
[19:46:05] <RA3OR> how can i access the unserialized data?
[19:46:33] <RA3OR> after update, i want to put the new changes on form
[19:46:53] <RA3OR> on a info tab, sorry
[19:47:00] <RA3OR> on same page
[19:47:40] <coldhead> you could use something like http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/deparam/
[19:47:52] <coldhead> to extract the values from the serialized form
[19:48:05] <coldhead> and then painstakingly reapply them to each form element
[19:48:20] <coldhead> until you're so tired and sad and sick at heart that you just want the world to stop
[19:48:35] <RA3OR> cant i just use $("#xCountry").html('value of country from form'); ?
[19:48:44] <delac> how do I get val from <td><a></a>val</td> ?
[19:49:23] <coldhead> sure you can try that, RA3OR
[19:49:43] <coldhead> delac: $('td').clone().find('*').remove().end().text();
[19:50:33] <delac> coldhead: thanks, going to try
[19:50:43] <RA3OR> $("#xcity").html(document.getElementById("city").value);
[19:50:46] <RA3OR> something like this
[19:52:00] <coldhead> yes, if that is the right value then happy times, RA3OR
[19:52:13] <coldhead> i thought you meant how to repopulate a new form with the old form's data
[19:52:20] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[19:56:34] <coldhead> and speak of his love and if he were cursed
[20:00:49] <delac> coldhead:  seems that $('td').text(); was quite enough, or did the rest have some deeper meaning?
[20:02:06] <coldhead> delac: oh if you have something in the <a>that you didn't want</a>
[20:02:09] <coldhead> it would excluse that
[20:02:11] <coldhead> exclude*
[20:03:47] <delac> I see. I dont think it ever has, but I'm going to take a note. thanks!
[20:05:03] <thomedy> quick question.,. i wrote a custom jquery plugin not for the plugins sake but for an exmpla for a possible job to show my range
[20:05:06] <thomedy> but thats not my question
[20:05:22] <thomedy> i used it to modify the dom and add a canvas
[20:05:34] <thomedy> and then used that canvas to make a quick and dirty doodle pad
[20:05:59] <thomedy> well it works but when i do ev.pageX - (elem).offset().left
[20:06:12] <thomedy> it moves the mouse xpos at 2x it seems like
[20:06:36] <thomedy> i dont understadn because as far as i can tell offset grabs the position of the element your inrelative to dhte document
[20:06:40] <thomedy> http://www.thesartorer.com/flunk_it/customjqplugin/
[20:15:56] <thomedy> no one?
[20:21:07] <BryanRuiz1> my client mentioned object oriented javascript..  i just really namespace my javascript and go from there..  you guys have any suggestions on a best practice and reasons for it?
[20:21:39] <thomedy> check out object literals, and function notation in object creation
[20:21:42] <thomedy> oop is the way to go
[20:21:48] <thomedy> mdn?
[20:21:55] <thomedy> mozilla
[20:22:50] <coldhead> i can see what you're describing thomedy but i can't explain it
[20:22:55] <coldhead> it's like the x-files
[20:23:11] <BryanRuiz1> i see a bunch of Class.create()'s which i think is a prototype thing, and I'm wondering how the hell you recognize where the code begins
[20:23:23] <thomedy> i dont know either becase im prett sure im right about how this thing is supposed to work
[20:23:34] <thomedy> BryanRuiz1, ?
[20:24:19] <BryanRuiz1> eh
[20:24:29] <coldhead> thomedy: maybe it's to do with the window size? does it work any better if you only catch mousemoves OVER the canvas, rather than anywhere?
[20:24:57] <thomedy> im wondering if its because i dynamically set css to 50 % and if i did window.innerHeighth / 2
[20:25:10] <thomedy> i could do this with pixels which is a common issue i have found
[20:25:13] <coldhead> INTERESTING
[20:25:36] <thomedy> BryanRuiz1,  are you saying you read the page and dont understand where to satart are you saying you looked at the page and gave up immediately
[20:26:43] <Abhijit> hi
[20:27:15] <Abhijit> i have made a magazine using turn.js but its right page images are going down upon mouse hover on turned page corners?
[20:27:16] <Abhijit> help please
[20:27:24] <BryanRuiz1> thomedy: my job role requires me not to give up.  no, im going to do this object oriented, I just dont get what the entry point of these OO classes is, and I got to figure that out
[20:27:39] <hip2p> I want to be able to edit the text in a div without having to convert the div to a textarea. Is there a way in jquery so that as soon as I click in the div, it allows me to edit without using a textarea? As soon as I click away from the div, it would save the text edits.
[20:27:51] <BryanRuiz1> my js debugging skills arent to great and there is a bunch of js, so im not sure how I can figure out whats going on
[20:28:03] <thomedy> im going to paste bin some examples real quick but you need to know  about closure, and prototype and the different types of notation
[20:28:12] <thomedy> do you usually jquery
[20:28:17] <BryanRuiz1> yeah
[20:28:53] <thomedy> okay yeah ... i do jquery as well if necessary but the problem i find with not knowing actual javascript is what you rrunning into right now
[20:29:06] <thomedy> one sec..im going to do a quick and dirty one
[20:29:37] <mfoxdogg|work> afternoon all
[20:29:50] <hip2p> hi
[20:29:55] <BryanRuiz1> thanks thomedy, but im wondering, this thing is using prototypejs for the OO i think, and it be a.. somewhat of a crazy move of mine to switch it all over to JS
[20:30:04] <BryanRuiz1> s/JS/jquery
[20:31:19] <thomedy> i dont usually use libraries the only reason im doing jquery now is because i may be getting a kick as job for 8k/month if i go back to jquery... so i decided to write some jquery plugins and they are working fine but my canvas tag offset is pissing me off
[20:31:25] <thomedy> i dont know much abou tprototype js
[20:31:37] <thomedy> but prototyping is no t that bad
[20:31:59] <thomedy> wait i think i just realized im a bad ass
[20:32:10] <BryanRuiz1> :)
[20:32:28] <Whirl3d_> thomedy, you crack me up
[20:33:23] <Abhijit> i have made a magazine using turn.js but its right page images are going down upon mouse hover on turned page corners?
[20:33:36] <thomedy> http://pastebin.com/i95fcyGd
[20:34:02] <thomedy> okay its real simple stuff but if you r client is requireing you to go oop which i recommend because of the nature of both progress and codeing styles
[20:34:12] <thomedy> you need to dig into the mdn files at developer.mozilla.org
[20:34:17] <thomedy> this isn't going to get you there
[20:34:36] <thomedy> its pretty cool if you like coding youl dig it
[20:34:54] <thomedy> im intending to write a jquery plug in at some point for doing 3d work with the canvas tag
[20:34:56] <thomedy> i love that shit
[20:35:28] <thomedy> and i think that will get me some notoriety.. i dont want to pretend im being humble... im doingit to build my name
[20:37:12] <Whirl3d_> Notorious, possibly.
[20:39:30] <BryanRuiz1> it honestly just looks like stuff is sort of stuck in classes and then classes are just used, no other design patterns from what I see..
[20:40:00] <BryanRuiz1> and by classes, i mean whatever prototypejs Create.class creates
[20:40:15] <BryanRuiz1> sorry for the offtopic stuff, i intend to do as much jQuery as possible
[20:43:25] <aghouseh> trying to attach a unified anonymous function to the click, focus, and blur events of a select
[20:43:42] <aghouseh> is there a way to do that without having to declare it beforehand?
[20:44:01] <aghouseh> like $select.on('click, focus, blur', function(){ //coolstuff });
[20:45:20] <Whirl3d_> aghouseh, why not declare it ahead of time?
[20:45:21] <thomedy> again i have never looked at prototype.js but when i say code style or what not i mean that the more modulated your code can be the more usable in multiple situations... in c++ we have templates and what not but i dont think that happens in js
[20:45:27] <thomedy> apart from that... i just think oop
[20:45:35] <thomedy> thats the strict languages fault
[20:45:37] <aghouseh> Whirl3d_: i can, i guess it just seems not DRY in any context
[20:46:08] <thomedy> but what your doing also is avoiding window scoped variables which arent too much of a problem in jquery due to document.ready
[20:46:09] <aghouseh> .on({click: myfunc()}, {focus: myfunc()}) etc
[20:46:36] <thomedy> but is a problem in general and if you want to do this more you are going to want to increase your vocabulary for coding
[20:47:26] <Whirl3d_> aghouseh, on({click:myfunc, focus:myfunc, blur:myfunc})
[20:47:41] <aghouseh> yea
[20:47:46] <aghouseh> seems non-DRY
[20:48:20] <aghouseh> found it anyway, tho actually.. :p $select.on('click focus blur', function(){ // awesome });
[20:55:42] <hip2p> is it possible to bind a contextmenu to a dynamic div, something like this: $(document).on("contextmenu", '.mydiv' function(event) {
[20:56:44] <hip2p> perhaps it's $('.mydiv').on("bind", 'contextmenu' function(event) {

[20:59:37] <hip2p> thanks
[20:59:57] <Whirl3d_> but does the ipad or ios device category support context menu?
[21:00:28] <hip2p> no idea, but it won't matter for my purposes
[21:00:57] <Whirl3d_> in jqueryUI, using .sortable() method to drag items in a UL, how do I prevent them from dropping in a child UL?
[21:03:25] <hateIE> if your feeding css pixel cordinates to a function in floating points rather then rounding them off would that impact performance significantly
[21:03:26] <hateIE> ?
[21:03:57] <hateIE> the function recieving the cordinates would be in this case: -webket-box-shadow
[21:04:30] <Cork> hateIE: most browsers will round them to closest pixel
[21:05:09] <Cork> so you most likely don't want to have decimals in your values, cause different browsers will render that differently
[21:05:33] <Cork> hateIE: and don't use -webkit-box-shadow, use box-shadow
[21:06:10] <xxx> cud anyone check this link and say what type of layout it is? http://www.fiestahomes.in/property.html
[21:06:13] <Cork> (with possible combination with all the prefixes if you want further backwards support)
[21:06:35] <hateIE> ok
[21:07:53] <thomedy> Im really stumped here
[21:13:40] <Whirl3d_> seriously? [23:31] <thomedy> wait i think i just realized im a bad ass
[21:14:17] <coldhead> hahahah Whirl3d_
[21:14:22] <Whirl3d_> and by that I mean, you, stumped?
[21:15:37] <thomedy> guilty... i wont take it back but will admit guilty... heres the deal according to what i read pageX is the full html ccs pixels and offset is the element relative to the document
[21:16:02] <xxx> @cork: cud you pls try this  check this link and say what type of layout it is? http://www.fiestahomes.in/property.html
[21:16:02] <b-ot> xxx: I am not in what.
[21:16:05] <thomedy> but im getting movement at 2x or 2y... which measn taht pageX is double some hwo
[21:18:08] <Whirl3d_> is your content scaled by 50%
[21:18:53] <hariom> Hi, I am using jquery ajax for submitting search form. When I submit query, I see the phrase "Submit Query" visible on the page for about 0.5 sec and then it disappears. I am not able to locate where is this phrase as I want to remove it
[21:19:23] <thomedy> yeah i was thinking about hat so my canvas is set to 50% widht so i thought maybe i should do pixels instead of %
[21:19:27] <thomedy> but yes
[21:19:32] <hariom> I tried grep on all my html files but I am not able to locate "Submit Query" phrase
[21:19:39] <thomedy> however i did try width set to window.innerWidht / 2
[21:19:51] <thomedy> maybe i should clear the cache in my browser
[21:19:55] <thomedy> and try again
[21:23:27] <thomedy> yeah taht didn't do anything i tried again
[21:24:51] <tw2113> if i'm getting this type of error, i'm getting too many found elements, right? Object #<HTMLCollection> has no method 'submit'
[21:24:55] <gadget00> hey
[21:27:06] <sasori> hi, how to select the background image of the site in jquery ?
[21:27:16] <DrZeus> with css?
[21:27:27] <sasori> jquery
[21:27:42] <sasori> let's say the body has no ID nor class at all
[21:27:44] <DrZeus> yes, but by using jquery you can alter the css
[21:27:45] <tw2113> ?css
[21:27:47] <bot-t> .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[21:28:04] <Whirl3d_> tw2113 sounds like you are selecting the element and not it's jquery object.
[21:28:17] <sasori> i want to make the background image clickable, i was thinking if i can select the background image and add a jquery function to it..
[21:28:23] <DrZeus> for example: $("body").css('background', 'image.png');
[21:28:32] <tw2113> Whirl3d_, it has to do with the fuckery known as facebook connect
[21:28:41] <Whirl3d_> lol
[21:28:54] <tw2113> sasori, you can make the dom element that has the background clickable
[21:29:00] <tw2113> you won't be able to make the image itself clickable
[21:29:18] <tw2113> may need to inject an <a> tag into it to actually click on
[21:29:21] <Whirl3d_> careful with the language. They have been known to kick for foulmouthedness...I think they just let colhead back in after saying a bad word recently.
[21:29:26] <Whirl3d_> on his first day
[21:29:41] <sasori> tw2113: how ? :S got no idea
[21:30:28] <Whirl3d_> sasori, just make an image element on your body element and make it take up the full screen width/height at z-index:-9999
[21:30:41] <DrZeus> I'm having a problem with the get() in jquery; when I use the $.get() to call an url that has variables on it("url.com?m=this&n=that") it doesn't read the variables in the URL
[21:31:23] <Whirl3d_> ?.get
[21:31:24] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[21:31:26] <DrZeus> if I write directly in the browser url.com?m=this&n=that I can handle the $_GET array in php with those values; if I use $.get() those variables are empty
[21:31:27] <sasori> Whirl3d_: you mean, <body><img url="blah" /></body > ?
[21:31:46] <DrZeus> what can I do
[21:31:47] <DrZeus> ?
[21:32:36] <Whirl3d_> did you try using the syntax $.get({url:url, data:"m=this&n=that"});
[21:32:58] <Whirl3d_> sasori, yes. Use css to make that image take up the full screen
[21:33:40] <sasori> then how to select that in jquery? by adding an id or class ?
[21:33:41] <DrZeus> actually I haven't written data like that; I tried $.get(url,{m:this, n:that}, function(){etc code; } )
[21:33:53] <Whirl3d_> id would be ideal, but sure.
[21:34:23] <Whirl3d_> DrZeus, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[21:34:26] <DrZeus> and also tried $.get("url?m=this&n="+var, function(){etc code;} )
[21:34:37] <DrZeus> but in both cases it didn't work
[21:34:47] <DrZeus> Whirl3d_: let me try that
[21:34:49] <sasori> what's the usual width and height of the screen ?
[21:34:55] <Whirl3d_> Shows the parameters being passed as an object with a url attribute and a data attribute...
[21:35:05] <Whirl3d_> 100%
[21:35:48] <Whirl3d_> sasori, set your width and height to 100% or check out supersized (google it)
[21:38:54] <DrZeus> Whirl3d_: it gave me a "missing ) after argument list" error, I wrote it like this: 	$.get(url, data:'m=edicion&elemid='+codigo, **codigo is a variable
[21:39:13] <Whirl3d_> read the page again.
[21:40:06] <Whirl3d_> It says, explicitly: $.get({url:url, data:data});  you are not passing the parameters according to the instructions. I'm not saying that's why, but perhaps you should try it like the instructions indicate
[21:42:21] <DrZeus> Whirl3d_: ok, I'll read again
[21:42:26] <sasori> Whirl3d_: i added an <img> just under the body tag that takes up the whole screen with z-index: -9999... it appeared on the top of the site :/
[21:48:37] <Whirl3d_> Look in your browser and be sure that the z-index property is correct. It sounds like it is not. Did you set that in your css for the image?
[21:49:04] <hip2p> I click on $(this), and it takes me to a function. how would I call another function in the first one so that I can use $(this)? I tried $(this).myFunction(), but that didn't work
[21:49:45] <hip2p> should I pass $(this) as a function parameter?
[21:50:13] <Whirl3d_> huh?
[21:50:24] <Whirl3d_> $ is a function
[21:50:33] <hip2p> I'll post the code
[21:52:37] <hip2p> http://jsfiddle.net/nmCmB/1/
[21:52:48] <hip2p> I want to go to myFunction and still use $(this)
[21:53:35] <Cork> hip2p: myFunction.call(this)
[21:53:45] <hip2p> thanks Cork
[21:54:22] <Whirl3d_> lol, beat me to it.  I am never sure when to use apply and when to use call
[21:54:35] <Cork> Whirl3d_: in this case both works
[21:54:44] <Cork> apply takes an array for arguments
[21:54:47] <hip2p> yep, call worked
[21:54:49] <Cork> call takes a list
[21:55:08] <Cork> but the first argument is the this variable in both cases
[21:55:12] <Whirl3d_> won't $(this) refer to document?
[21:55:16] <Cork> no
[21:55:29] <Cork> it will take the this from the current event handler
[21:55:36] <hip2p> Whirl3d_ I thought that, too
[21:55:43] <Whirl3d_> forgot about that syntax
[21:55:46] <Whirl3d_> I never use it
[21:56:20] <Whirl3d_> I always get "this" from $(e.target); and skip the second parameter...$(document).on("click", function (e) {...
[21:56:22] <Cork> js> function test() { print(this); }; test.call('hmmm');
[21:56:24] <b-ot> Cork: hmmm
[21:56:57] <Cork> Whirl3d_: well you don't get delegated event listeners that way
[21:57:05] <Whirl3d_> $(document).on("click", function (e) { console.log($(this)); }) should be document, though.
[21:57:08] <Cork> as delegate works with bubbling too
[21:57:12] <Cork> yes
[21:57:32] <Whirl3d_> that's where I got confused, I forgot he called the target in the second parameter...
[21:57:46] <Whirl3d_> *indicated not called
[21:57:54] <Cork> s/called/delegated/
[21:57:55] <Cork> :)
[21:58:59] <xxx> someone check this http://jsfiddle.net/3STeh/498/
[21:59:42] <Cork> xxx: you need to ask a question too
[22:00:30] <DrZeus> is this syntax correct?: $.ajax({
[22:00:30] <xxx> @cork:want to minimize width and height of the inner
[22:00:31] <DrZeus> 	url:url,
[22:00:32] <DrZeus> 	data:param,
[22:00:33] <DrZeus> 	success:function () {
[22:00:35] <DrZeus> 		alert(url);
[22:00:38] <DrZeus> 		$('#form1').css('display','table');
[22:00:38] <DrZeus> 		document.getElementById("activado").focus();
[22:00:39] <DrZeus> 	},
[22:00:40] <DrZeus> 	dataType:'html'
[22:00:41] <DrZeus> 	});
[22:00:42] <DrZeus> sorry, should have used pastebin
[22:00:45] <Cork> ?p @ DrZeus
[22:00:46] <bot-t> DrZeus, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:03:15] <Whirl3d_> in the callback function for animate, is the animated item passed as a parameter?
[22:03:27] <Cork> xxx: thats how tables works
[22:03:34] <Whirl3d_> or is it just the context with no parameter?
[22:03:50] <Cork> Whirl3d_: i think its the this variable; but not sure
[22:03:57] <Cork> check the source
[22:04:26] <xxx> @cork: can't we minimize the width and height of the pink solor box
[22:04:33] <xxx> color*
[22:04:46] <Cork> sure, reduce the size of the table
[22:05:08] <gadget00> hey
[22:05:11] <gadget00> nick DrZeus
[22:05:32] <Cork> xxx:  http://jsfiddle.net/3STeh/501/
[22:06:06] <xxx> @cork: sry that is not expected one
[22:06:24] <xxx> i wud like to reduce the inner pink color box only
[22:06:32] <gadget00> I want to know if this is correct: http://jsfiddle.net/jeWdj/
[22:07:06] <gadget00> http://jsfiddle.net/jeWdj/1/
[22:07:26] <DrZeus> because still the query is not receiving the data
[22:07:29] <DrZeus> jquery
[22:07:55] <xxx> @cork: it looks  u still didn't get what am trying to do
[22:08:19] <Cork> xxx: if you want more separation you will have to add another table inside the td
[22:08:30] <Cork> or better yet; not use tables
[22:09:37] <xxx> @cork: ok let me try and let you know
[22:09:50] <DrZeus> please someone tell me if my ajax code is correct, because the $_GET still doesn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/jeWdj/1/
[22:10:55] <rollitup> hi ppl
[22:11:01] <Cork> DrZeus: i recommend using an object instead of param
[22:11:13] <DrZeus> Cork: how's that?
[22:11:23] <Cork> DrZeus: much less risk of generating broken data
[22:11:38] <Cork> data: { key1: value, key2: value }
[22:12:07] <Cork> but yes, the syntax does look correct
[22:12:42] <Cork> DrZeus: is the call to the same domain as where you run the script?
[22:12:54] <Cork> hmm sean from the php code thats yes...
[22:13:00] <DrZeus> yes it is; I'm using MAMP right now, still not production code
[22:13:33] <Cork> check the network tab in the browser and check what you send
[22:13:52] <Cork> but yes, the problem doesn't look to be on the client side
[22:13:53] <DrZeus> but by using $.ajax(), it just doesn't give me the same results as just writing on the browser url.com?m=this&elemid=that
[22:14:19] <DrZeus> the $_GET[m] and $_GET[elemid] appear empty
[22:14:25] <DrZeus> when I use $.ajax
[22:14:27] <DrZeus> don't know why
[22:14:27] <Cork> DrZeus: might be that your server sniffs for the ajax header
[22:15:14] <Cork> but really the network tab in your browser is the easiest way to see what differs
[22:15:30] <Cork> make one call through the url bar and one through ajax and compare the differences
[22:15:50] <DrZeus> ok, where do I open it? Im using FF right now
[22:16:06] <Cork> ctrl+shift+k
[22:16:10] <Cork> or the net tab if you use firebug
[22:16:33] <DrZeus> oh, ok
[22:17:11] <xxx> @cork: check know http://jsfiddle.net/3STeh/511/
[22:17:22] <rollitup> i am attempting to implement the Bouncebox plugin on this site http://icecreamworks.com , but the box somehow just stays on top can someone point out where I am wrong
[22:17:37] <xxx> @cork: i want insert  a rectangular box inside it
[22:18:05] <Cork> xxx: like i said WHY do you use tables for markup?
[22:18:17] <Cork> tables are for list of data
[22:18:57] <coldhead> and for easy layout
[22:19:03] * Cork nods
[22:19:32] <hip2p> I create a dynamic textarea when I click on a div. The textarea assumes the div's text, and I want the textarea to autosize to fit all of the text on the screen. I was going to set the textarea's height to its scroll height, but scroll height is 0 at that point.
[22:19:35] <Cork> tables has tons of special rules, and you end up having to wrestle quite a bit with it if you try to do things its not intended for
[22:20:30] <Cork> hip2p: have you thought about using contentEditable instead?
[22:20:55] <hip2p> no, I'll look into that
[22:21:02] <Cork> ?mdc contentEditable
[22:21:03] <bot-t> Cork, Content Editable - HTML | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Content_Editable
[22:21:06] <hip2p> thanks
[22:21:26] <hip2p> oh well this could be too simple
[22:21:35] <Cork> :)
[22:22:23] <scar> i have jquery triggers loaded and in the same js file, i have a window bind load and it uses ajax to bring in html that has classes/ids that match the triggers in this same js file. the triggers work until i use the ajax method. any way to "reload" dom or reactivate these?
[22:22:40] <hip2p> wow contentEditable is exactly what I was looking for. Thanks, Cork.
[22:23:02] <Cork> hip2p: its funny how many web developers doesn't know about it
[22:23:13] <Cork> even though its been around for over 15 years :)
[22:23:17] <hip2p> really? wow
[22:23:31] <Cork> was introduced in ie back in 3 i think
[22:23:40] <Cork> or possibly 4 don't remember
[22:23:45] <hip2p> nice
[22:24:03] <Cork> all browser has supported it for the last 10+ years
[22:24:23] <Cork> with a possible exception for lynks :)
[22:24:36] <coldhead> but if you use contentEditable then ANYONE with a browser can change the content of your site!!!!
[22:24:36] <hip2p> I'm surprised because so many people say that divs are dynamically editable
[22:24:40] <DrZeus> Cork: question--> in the data{} can I use a variable as a value of a key? example: data{key1: jsvar1, key2: jsvar2}
[22:24:46] <hip2p> that you have to convert it to a textarea first then convert back
[22:24:57] <scar> i just placed them within the bind load
[22:24:59] <Cork> DrZeus: no not directly
[22:25:16] <Cork> DrZeus: you CAN do var mydata = {}; mydata[key] = value; though
[22:25:22] <Cork> data: mydata
[22:26:46] <tw2113> create an object, shove a value into a key index
[22:27:02] <tw2113> think i have that right
[22:28:16] <Cork> scar: you mean you do something like $('selector').click() ?
[22:28:17] <DrZeus> Cork: I see, I'll try that
[22:28:23] <DrZeus> thank you
[22:28:23] <Cork> and after the ajax it doesn't work?
[22:28:30] <Cork> DrZeus: np
[22:28:36] <scar> Cork, yes. and what i did was just placce those triggers within the $(window).bind()
[22:28:49] <scar> works now
[22:28:54] <scar> is this the wrong way?
[22:28:56] <Cork> scar: either that or use delegated event listeners
[22:29:00] <Cork> scar: depends
[22:29:04] <scar> ?
[22:29:14] <Cork> the elements have to exist in the dom before you can bind listeners to them
[22:29:31] <Cork> so if you replace them later in the page those listeners will break
[22:29:43] <Cork> but ya, what you did is most likely correct
[22:29:48] <scar> then why, when i replace the html, it works?
[22:30:12] <scar> prior to this onm y calendar, my next and prev buttons wrked, replacing the entire html of the calendar (each day was a trigger)
[22:30:17] <scar> glitch? :P
[22:30:21] <Cork> scar: cause you run the selectors after you've replaced them
[22:30:34] <scar> no i didnt though...
[22:30:56] <Cork> there is only two options 1. the elements exist in the dom, or it doesn't work :)
[22:31:03] <Cork> unless you use delegated event listeners
[22:31:18] <Cork> scar: did you run the selectors in document ready before
[22:31:24] <Cork> or directly in the script tag?
[22:31:27] <scar> yup
[22:31:32] <scar> 1sr
[22:31:34] <coldhead> are*
[22:31:35] <scar> st
[22:31:49] <Cork> can't really tell what happens there without seeing the code
[22:32:12] <Cork> but no, its not glitchy
[22:35:30] <scar> Cork, yeah sry botu that
[22:36:35] <scar> on that url, before i had the initial calendar loading via ajax, the prev/next buttons worked... it wuld replace the div with all the rows.
[22:37:00] <scar> and the triggers on each day, even the regenerated ones, woul sstill work
[22:37:17] <scar> either way, all the triggers work when i moved over to the window bind load, however the next/prev d not work
[22:37:24] <djQuery> yo
[22:37:24] <scar> i will have to look as to why
[22:37:31] <scar> i think something on my php
[22:37:31] <djQuery> DJDan, yes
[22:37:56] <scar> Cork, did you get my pm?
[22:37:59] <Cork> heh nice quite message
[22:38:06] <Cork> scar: preferably not
[22:38:30] <Palanivel> Hi to every one
[22:38:31] <scar> oh it was the url to the site
[22:38:35] <scar> nvm then sorry hah
[22:39:28] <Whirl3d_> Cork, I think that the reference to the animated object is passed in context only, not as a parameter of the callback.
[22:39:37] <DJDan> djQuery: when i drop the answer to the question, then drag it back.. the width changes midair to really small.. how do i fix that?.. its fine once its dragged back
[22:40:48] <Palanivel> i included secondary html page via iframe. secondary html contains 2 diff buttons which name as save and cancel.. i want to hit/fire the function if the user clicked the button....
[22:41:07] <Palanivel> And i triend  $('.iframepopup').contents().find('.bClose').bind('click' function() { });
[22:41:16] <Palanivel> But it's not working
[22:41:51] <Cork> Whirl3d_: this.options.step.call( this.elem, this.now, this );
[22:41:53] <Palanivel> Any one can share your knowledge
[22:42:03] <Cork> Whirl3d_: so "this" should be the animated object
[22:42:04] <DrZeus> Cork: the net tab tells gives me that the ajax call went OK, but still the variables are empty.  After the ajax call goes and reloads the page, can I use $_GET with the data sent in the ajax call? Is there other way to use that data when the ajax call finishes? maybe there's where I'm missing it
[22:42:53] <Cork> DrZeus: uh, no if you do an ajax call and then reloads the pages; thats two separate calls to the server
[22:43:10] <Cork> that would only work if the server has code to connect the two (normally through a database)
[22:43:23] <djQuery> ?dragable
[22:43:25] <bot-t> djQuery, Using jQuery UI (dragable - Bug Tracker - jQuery - Opened 3 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8182

[22:44:09] <DrZeus> Im sorry, I didn't meant reload the page as in "click refresh", but the ajax calls the same .php webpage but with different parameters
[22:44:21] <Cork> Whirl3d_: sorry meant "the animated element"
[22:45:10] <Cork> DrZeus: if the net tab show that the ajax call has the data you want in the params tab
[22:45:14] <djQuery> DJDan, in that case I would use the addClasses option to have a class added to the dragable when it is being draged, you could set a min and max size in that class to prevent it from getting to small

[22:45:25] <DrZeus> Cork: yes it does
[22:45:26] <Cork> DrZeus: then ya, the error is server side, not client side
[22:46:02] <Cork> DrZeus: the params page should be a list of <key>  <values> though
[22:46:09] <Cork> (in that tab)
[22:46:29] <DrZeus> yes, like this right?
[22:46:30] <DrZeus> elemid	3946
[22:46:31] <DrZeus> m	edicion
[22:46:33] <Cork> yes
[22:46:48] <Cork> so, firebug sees it as valid key value pairs
[22:47:01] <Cork> so the error is definitely server side
[22:47:37] <djQuery> so do you thing 5152 ms is to long to create 2000 ui buttons
[22:47:48] <DrZeus> in my php code, I check if $_GET['key'] is set in the beginning of the code; could it be that the variable is empty at that point?
[22:47:51] <Cork> 5 seconds
[22:47:51] <DrZeus> I don't know
[22:47:54] <Cork> its not little
[22:48:20] <DrZeus> because it receives it from the ajax call
[22:48:47] <Cork> DrZeus: check var_dump($_REQUEST)
[22:49:08] <DrZeus> I can echo that, right?
[22:49:12] <Cork> yes
[22:49:23] <Cork> should be in the response tab in firebug
[22:49:30] <Cork> (if you do)
[22:49:42] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/etawoy/11/edit
[22:49:42] <DrZeus> ok, nice
[22:49:52] <DrZeus> thank you very much, you've helped me a lot
[22:50:04] <DrZeus> just tonight I started coding ajax 4 the first time
[22:50:17] <DrZeus> with jquery
[22:50:55] <Cork> heh that reminded me of when i first tried to do ajax
[22:51:01] <Cork> was interesting :)
[22:51:04] <djQuery> Cork, http://jsbin.com/etawoy/11/edit
[22:51:35] <Cork> yikes
[22:51:46] * Cork pokes chromium
[22:51:58] <someprimetime_> appending within a while?
[22:52:00] <Cork> hmm the page crashed >_>
[22:52:06] <litenull> Cork: remember the crossword ? thanks to you i optimized it to 10ms and it works very good on mobile :)
[22:52:06] <someprimetime_> bold move
[22:52:21] <Cork> litenull: nice
[22:52:31] <litenull> i cached everything
[22:52:33] <Cork> djQuery: won't load for me
[22:52:42] <djQuery> only the .buttonset()   takes a while
[22:52:43] <litenull> its gooood :)
[22:52:54] <xxx> @cork: how to move the table to my desired location in my webpage ?
[22:53:08] <djQuery> xxx, see appendTo
[22:53:15] <djQuery> ?appendto@xxx
[22:53:16] <bot-t> xxx, .appendTo(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the end of the target. http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[22:53:47] <djQuery> or edit your php\asp\html to have it in the correct place to start with
[22:55:02] <djQuery> someprimetime_, the while takes no time at all
[22:55:26] <djQuery> someprimetime_, what should I have used a for?
[22:55:42] <Cork> djQuery: your prob better of building an html string in those loops and then appending it in one big chunk
[22:55:49] <someprimetime_> no but you should never append any html within a loop, like ever
[22:55:54] <xxx> span tag is used for ??
[22:55:56] <someprimetime_> DOM operations are expensive enough as it is
[22:56:00] <someprimetime_> do what Cork says
[22:56:09] <djQuery> Cork, on a prod I would the only thing being timed here is the buttonset
[22:56:28] <motka> :D
[22:56:32] <djQuery> trying to work on a bug for .button where it takes a long time when there is a lottta html
[22:56:46] <Cork> djQuery: there is no buttonset calls in that jsbin
[22:56:55] <Cork> and it still takes ages to run
[22:57:12] <djQuery> $('.test').buttonset();
[22:57:18] <someprimetime_> anyone using underscore with jade in here?
[22:57:32] <Cork> //$('.test').buttonset() ya
[22:58:42] <Cork> djQuery: but ya, button/buttonset does quite a bit of dom modifications
[22:59:01] <Cork> i would prob use a pure css scheama instead
[22:59:59] <Cork> input[type="checkbox"] + label { /* style like button */ } input[type="checkbox"]:checked + label { style checked }
[23:00:08] <Cork> (and label:hover)
[23:00:28] <Cork> wouldn't even need js :)
[23:01:22] <djQuery> Cork, yeah but I cant do that when I am trying to close out bugs for the ui.button and ui.buttonset
[23:01:32] <Cork> heh ah
[23:02:24] <Cork> djQuery: didn't think about the fact that you could actually try to do regression search :)
[23:02:43] <Cork> djQuery: do you get the same if you go back a version if the libs?
[23:02:44] <djQuery> evidently it has a hard time finding the label for checkbox and radios
[23:02:58] <Cork> like jquery 1.8.3 and jquery-ui 1.8.23
[23:02:59] <Cork> or something
[23:03:15] <djQuery> Cork, its been there for a while now evidently
[23:03:40] <Cork> djQuery: might be that it moves elements around and wrap them
[23:03:53] <Cork> check the dom structure when its done; its quite different
[23:04:27] <djQuery> Cork, it does that with regular buttons as well I think its the actual hunt for the label as it is an expesive query
[23:04:53] <djQuery> its doing an atribute search for the for=radioid
[23:04:58] <Cork> djQuery: do you get the same with button or is it just buttonset?
[23:05:25] <djQuery> its any time its radios or checkboxes
[23:05:33] <djQuery> not buttonset in particular
[23:05:34] * Cork nods
[23:06:03] <Cork> wait so it searches for for="" and not the other way around?
[23:06:26] <djQuery> just sometimes it searchs the entire document for it
[23:06:40] <djQuery> instead of checking siblings then going up a little
[23:06:46] <Cork> ya it would have to
[23:06:55] <Cork> there is no limitation to where the label can be
[23:07:20] <Cork> it could be absolutely positioned and directly in the body for all html cares
[23:07:31] <Cork> and a full dom search for an attribute selector... sucks
[23:07:33] <djQuery> it would still be better to check siblings first then check to see if it is in a tr etc
[23:07:55] <Cork> it would optimize for the normal case ya
[23:08:39] <djQuery> sibligns, tr, form, document is what I was thinking
[23:09:00] <Cork> that doesn't have to be faster actally
[23:09:02] <Cork> *actually
[23:09:18] <Cork> as it would require more calls to the native selector handler
[23:09:43] <djQuery> it would be fast if you applied the button to the label then had it go search for the check
[23:09:51] <Cork> parent and parent's parent check could prob help though
[23:10:12] <djQuery> if($this.hasAttribute('for)){ go find the input by ID}
[23:10:24] <Cork> djQuery: if they search for the input field, and then find the label from there; it won't though
[23:10:47] <Cork> and ya, looking for the label and go from there would work better
[23:10:49] <djQuery> yeah unfortunetly you apply button to the input not the inputs label
[23:11:07] <Cork> but then you get the problem of how do you know if the label is for an input element that should be a button?
[23:11:21] <djQuery> check to see if it has a for
[23:11:32] <djQuery> for is only applicable when there is an input correct?
[23:11:51] <Cork> <label>url:</label><input type="url" name="url">
[23:11:53] <djQuery> then check to see if the input is a check or radio
[23:12:02] <Cork> opps
[23:12:11] <Cork> <label for="url">url:</label><input id="url" type="url" name="url">
[23:12:15] <Cork> how should it handle that?
[23:12:15] <djQuery> I know what you were getting at
[23:12:26] <djQuery> it should cancel out
[23:12:39] <Cork> ya, and then you could lose the performance gains quite fast
[23:13:15] <Cork> though i guess they could require that the label is positioned directly after/before the input field if you want it to be a button
[23:14:18] <Cork> and then it could be as simple as doing $(this).next().and($(this).prev()).has('[for=" + this.id + "')
[23:15:53] <djQuery> Cork, but that doesn't lend itself to progressive enhancement
[23:16:06] <Cork> djQuery: it could actually
[23:16:35] <djQuery> <tr><td>label</td><td>input</td></tr> is how I see it a lot
[23:16:52] <Cork> well thats there problem for using tables for markup >_>
[23:17:24] <djQuery> I always do <label>Test<input /></label>
[23:17:39] <Cork> and thats not really correct either
[23:17:58] <djQuery> left text align the labels and float right the inputs
[23:18:10] <djQuery> its not?
[23:18:22] <Cork> no, as the input becomes part of the label
[23:18:25] <Cork> and its not
[23:20:06] <djQuery> almost through with the tests for this easy dialog addClass bug then the button stuff
[23:20:29] <djQuery> would be easy if I could just add an option for the label selector
[23:20:43] <djQuery> accept a string or a function that returns the label
[23:20:52] <Cork> djQuery: that would actually be really nice
[23:21:06] <coldhead> sexquisite
[23:21:12] <djQuery> you get the current behavior if it is null
[23:21:26] <Cork> djQuery: but how would you specify that its related to the current element?
[23:22:12] <djQuery> '.labelfor{id}'
[23:22:30] <Cork> :s
[23:22:40] <djQuery> where {id} is replaced in a loop over each input
[23:22:42] <Cork> you can't use that with the dom selectors
[23:23:04] <Cork> djQuery: isn't that basically what it does now?
[23:23:28] <Cork> (except for the dot)
[23:23:40] <Cork> ah now i get what your at
[23:23:50] <Cork> have a class on each label
[23:24:01] <djQuery> no notice that I gave it what would internal be switched to '.labelforTEST' internaly which would be a class selector
[23:24:07] <djQuery> which would be a lot faster
[23:24:32] <Cork> ya, do a class selection instead of an attribute
[23:24:40] <Cork> totally missed what you meant at first
[23:24:44] <djQuery> internaly in .button {id}  would be replaced with the id of the button
[23:24:44] <Cork> ya, that would help
[23:25:10] <djQuery> you could even do '#labelfor{id}'
[23:25:28] <Cork> if you want the id in there it would even be more correct
[23:25:31] <djQuery> but documenting it would be a bitch
[23:25:48] <djQuery> whats {id}
[23:25:54] <Cork> dn't think it would be that hard
[23:25:59] <Cork> *don't
[23:26:23] <djQuery> yes but this selector syntax isn't in any of the other plugins so I doubt it would fly
[23:27:08] <djQuery> just thinking off the top my head as if this were something being created from scratch
[23:27:11] <Cork> btw i don't think {} is invalid in id's
[23:27:26] <Cork> so that would hurt too :)
[23:27:38] <djQuery> i am just using {} to hold the variable that we would have to regex out
[23:28:04] <Cork> ya, but the problem is to find a value that wouldn't be valid in id's
[23:28:04] <Whirl3d_> can someone help me to figure out, when using sortable() with nested UL  elements, how do I prevent the inner ul from accepting outer ul li elements. It doesn't work the other way around, though.
[23:28:07] <djQuery> it would regex to '#labelforACTUALBUTTON ID'
[23:28:12] <Cork> i think they allow most anything now days
[23:28:34] <Cork> except spaces
[23:28:51] <djQuery> yes but spaces are valid for a selector so that wont fly
[23:28:58] <djQuery> need something invalid for both
[23:28:59] <Cork> exactly :)
[23:29:08] <djQuery> ~?
[23:29:09] <Cork> that was my point ^^'
[23:29:21] <djQuery> doenst mean it has to be just 1 char
[23:29:32] <Cork> i think # isn't allowed though
[23:29:39] * Cork goes to dig up the w3c specs
[23:29:46] <djQuery> but is allowed in selector again
[23:30:00] <djQuery> ~#var#~ is that allowed
[23:30:18] <Cork> would prob go with something like #{variable}
[23:30:25] <Cork> its quite common syntax for replacement
[23:32:34] <djQuery> options: {labelSelector: '#{}', labelRegex: whatever I aint great at regex}
[23:32:56] <djQuery> or we could just force then to use a function
[23:33:20] <djQuery> probably easier to document than all the #{var} stuff
[23:33:45] <djQuery> and what attr\properties are valid for var
[23:33:55] <djQuery> id? name? etc...
[23:33:57] <Cork> should be as simple as .replace(/#\{id}/, id)
[23:34:37] <Cork> a function would be slower though
[23:34:47] <Cork> as that would have to be executed for each loop
[23:34:48] <djQuery> not you would need to do a match and grab the actual var   and then see if the input has an attribute the same as the var
[23:35:10] <djQuery> which would be still slower
[23:35:35] <djQuery> or just restrict them to name and id
[23:35:47] <Cork> var key = selector.match(/#\{(?<key>)}/).key; then
[23:36:23] <djQuery> #label#{id}-#{name}
[23:36:39] <djQuery> for the realy analy retentive
[23:36:40] <Cork> var keys = selector.match(/#\{(?<key>)}/g); then
[23:36:41] <djQuery> lol
[23:36:42] <Cork> :)
[23:36:54] <Cork> ah no
[23:37:05] <Cork> var keys = selector.match(/#\{([^}]+)}/g); then
[23:37:39] <Palanivel> can any one give idea about how to get the values from iframe inside iframe
[23:37:50] <Cork> djQuery: but the variable would have to match what jquery provides so...
[23:38:08] <Palanivel> $('.frame').contents().find('p.id')
[23:38:13] <Cork> Palanivel: you mean reach into two iframes?
[23:38:22] <djQuery> no then you jsut loop through keys and do replaces with the inputs attributes
[23:38:23] <Cork> throug one iframe into the next?
[23:38:35] <Palanivel> this is helping to get if having only one iframe html page
[23:38:49] <Palanivel> @cork ya
[23:38:53] <djQuery> frameA acces stuff inside of frameA or in frameb?
[23:39:26] <Cork> Palanivel: $('.iframe').contents().find('.next-iframe').contents().find('p.id')
[23:39:27] <djQuery> script located in frameA or in parent or frameN?
[23:39:50] <djQuery> oh didn't think of nested frames
[23:39:52] <Cork> Palanivel: each iframe is its own document, so you have to load that document
[23:40:01] <Cork> contents() does that
[23:40:07] <Cork> ?.contents
[23:40:09] <bot-t> .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[23:42:49] <Whirl3d_> I didn't know you could access the contents of an iframe. I thought that was the entire idea behind iframes was that you couldn't have access to their content
[23:44:04] <Whirl3d_> same domain....that's the difference. Got it. thanks.
[23:44:10] <Palanivel> @cork even i tried that too but i getting error in console as  $(...).contents is not a function
[23:47:41] <Palanivel> what is the problem?
[23:52:48] <djQuery> Cork, got the time down a little bit http://jsbin.com/etawoy/13/edit
[23:53:24] <Cork> gah.. i hate that jsbin use localStorage...
[23:53:50] <djQuery> hate jsfiddle
[23:54:04] <Cork> i liked the old jsbin better
[23:54:48] <Cork> (the reason i hate localStorage dependency is that i disable it in my normal browsers)
[23:55:07] <litenull> is it possible to scroll diagonally with overflow:scroll ?
[23:55:16] <Cork> djQuery: nice, not at least its all down to what's caused by buttonset
[23:55:40] <Cork> litenull: scrollLeft
[23:55:41] <djQuery> Cork, the start and end dates only ran for the buttonset test
[23:55:57] <Cork> djQuery: ya, but i was talking about the load time feel of the page
[23:56:12] <Cork> "disable the buttonset line and see how fast it loads"
[23:56:17] <litenull> tnx
[23:56:18] <litenull> :)
[23:56:34] <djQuery> I have
[23:56:40] <Cork> is usually a good thing when making a testcase; else ppl with just complain about something thats not related
[23:57:02] <djQuery> kept it disabled to I got all the += correct
[23:59:32] <fRAiLtY-> Hi, I need this counter to countdown to 11AM every morning, then restart, but I can't seem to figure out the timings. Can anyone assist? http://jsfiddle.net/CQkL8/7/
