[00:09:29] <lenswipee> ah i see the problem
[00:09:39] <Uhkis> url was wrong?
[00:10:28] <lenswipee> yeah
[00:10:52] <lenswipee> Uhkis: you were right.
[00:16:52] <hellyeah> Cork: do you use chrome?
[01:06:13] <sopparus> hello
[01:06:32] <sopparus> anyone know of a thing to jump with a-z with the keyboard in lists?
[01:06:58] <sopparus> like press F and go to Food in a long list with stuff you could buy in a store
[01:07:30] <sopparus> cant find anything, im sure it exists though
[01:10:08] <Uhkis> like chosen?
[01:11:22] <pecpec> sopparus: Have you tried fiddling with the keydown method? Hardcode keypresses and bind them to anchors on the page?
[01:12:21] <sopparus> no, going to try that
[01:12:23] <sopparus> thanks
[01:13:56] <pecpec> have a hidden <div id="[letter]"></div> and on .keydown(function(e){ if  (e.keycode == [letter id] .... and scroll to your div
[01:43:34] <hellyeah> hey
[01:43:49] <hellyeah> i try to cancel event in the null column is that true approach? http://jsfiddle.net/19at0hwo/5/
[01:45:17] <sopparus> pecpec, how do I make it scroll to that place?
[01:45:44] <sopparus> hm might of find it
[01:47:37] <hellyeah> any help for me?
[01:51:30] <pecpec> sopparus: Try something along those lines    https://jsfiddle.net/z943d3o6/
[01:51:49] <garethdaine> Any of you folks know much about MEAN?
[01:52:03] <pecpec> sopparus: but "jquery scroll to div" should yield what you need
[02:11:03] <arup_r> I want to do frontend table sorting... Anything better than http://tablesorter.com/docs/ ?
[02:29:30] <sopparus> pecpec, thanks alot!
[02:29:42] <sopparus> mixed that with the keyboard stuff
[02:29:48] <sopparus> should be able to do what I want know
[02:35:32] <pecpec> sopparus: Glad I could help :-) Good luck!
[02:40:55] <nirakara> hi could someone help. im trying to do what i did here: http://jsfiddle.net/dbLu5/9/ over here http://jsfiddle.net/dbLu5/10/ but in the second fiddle i can't get the slide up effect. it seems the .off slide is going under the incoming slide. I haven't changed any of the css or anything. its like this because im popping from a queue in my actual code, trying to make an infinte slider supported by a backend
[02:45:28] <nirakara> pecpec, any chance you could help me? :)
[02:49:05] <nirakara> anyone?
[02:49:08] <`ULT> hi
[02:49:09] <nirakara> *bump*
[02:49:13] <`ULT> how can i write something like this?  var title = "hoi";
[02:49:13] <`ULT>  $("#output").html("<tr><th>").text(title).html("</tr></th>");
[02:50:15] <`ULT> nvm + does the trick I see
[02:50:30] <Cork> `ULT: $('<tr>').append($('<th>', { text: title }))
[02:50:42] <Cork> you want to avoid concating values if you can
[02:50:51] <Cork> it exposes you to xss if you do
[02:51:00] <nirakara> Cork, can you help?
[02:51:27] <`ULT> thanks cork
[02:51:31] <Cork> nirakara: didn't read that wall of text, shorten it down if you want me to help
[02:52:23] <Cork> (also i'll be going on 8 minutes)
[02:52:26] <nirakara> Cork, working: http://jsfiddle.net/dbLu5/9/ ; not working: http://jsfiddle.net/dbLu5/10/ why is slide up happening in the backgroun in "not working"
[02:54:38] <Cork> nirakara: you need to trigger a reflow of the page for the initial position to start the transition (a simple .height() on the element should do)
[02:54:55] <nirakara> nirakara, where should that happen?
[02:55:03] <nirakara> sorry Cork
[02:55:05] <Cork> :)
[02:55:09] <nirakara> lol
[02:55:11] <Cork> talking with your self?
[02:55:16] <nirakara> >_<
[02:55:20] <nirakara> happens not only on IRC
[02:55:22] <nirakara> :P
[02:55:57] <Cork> nirakara: not fully sure, haven't understood it completely
[02:56:15] <Cork> but it looks like right before the removeClass('current')...
[02:56:21] <Cork> current.height();
[02:57:03] <nirakara> Cork, yay, that worked! thanks
[02:57:14] <nirakara> Cork, if you hav time why was it working in the latter and not the former?
[02:58:00] <Cork> nirakara: cause the element is constantly in the page
[02:58:03] <`ULT> cork, quick question:
[02:58:11] <Cork> so they have alreay got an initial rendering
[02:58:14] <`ULT> is $('#output').append($('<th>', { text: title })) better than: $('#output').html("<tr><th>"+title+"</tr></th>"); ?
[02:58:30] <nirakara> Thanks Cork
[02:59:43] <Cork> `ULT: let me put it like this: var title = '<scr'+'ipt>$.ajax('attacker', { data: $('#password').val() })); </scri'+'pt>'); $('#output').html("<tr><th>"+title+"</tr></th>");
[03:00:14] <Cork> `ULT: get the problem? :D
[03:01:17] <Cork> `ULT: while if you give it to text: or .text() that script will be escaped and printed like normal text
[03:01:46] <Whiskey> <div id="1" class="2"><pre class="3 4"> How do i make sure that 3 4 is removed and then reinsert it again?
[03:03:11] <`ULT> you have right cork, that is not realy save :p
[03:03:12] <`ULT> thanks.
[03:16:32] <drake01> hi, jquery code I am working on creates elements dynamically and click, shown.bs.modal events are attached to handlers. Its working in all browsers except internet explorer (ie8). Can I fix it for ie8?
[03:20:07] <guessx> drake are you using click/live/on/delegate?
[03:30:05] <sopparus> pecpec: do you mind looking at my page? I cant get it to work
[03:30:11] <sopparus> works in fiddle though
[03:30:31] <drake01> guessx: I am using on('click', handler1) ,  .on('shown.bs.modal, handler2) using jquery 1.9.1
[03:39:05] <guessx> drake, dont you need a namespace between the click and handler?
[03:39:54] <guessx> *not namespace $(document).on("click", ".classname#IDname", function() {...});
[03:47:45] <blinky_> Hi all,  I have a postcode search running that works brilliant.  I would like to have an alert flash if the postcode is not found.  If I look at the console when I place an incorrect postcode I get this error 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'geometry' of undefined', how can I check is the geometry is defined or not and alert the user? - http://jsfiddle.net/5Ljds30u/
[03:48:07] <dimi1947> how I could access the first li item of an ul
[03:48:16] <hellyeah> pls look at log function why it didnt give me anything http://jsfiddle.net/19at0hwo/19/
[03:48:43] <blinky_> dimi1947, $('ul#someList li:first')
[03:48:51] <Cork> blinky_: r['results'].length > 0
[03:49:18] <dimi1947> thanks....blinky...now to test it...
[03:49:23] <Cork> blinky_: also you can convert r['results'][0]['geometry']['location']['lat'] to r.results[0].geometry.location.lat
[03:49:30] <Cork> makes it a bit more readable
[03:49:42] <blinky_> Cork, ah, cheers mate, was trying if(r) and if(!r)
[03:49:50] <blinky_> ok will have a play now, cheers
[03:50:19] <Cork> blinky_: also don't put element tags infront of ids
[03:50:29] <Cork> you make the query slower for no reason
[03:51:28] <blinky_> Cork, Sorry you lost me on that last one.
[03:51:51] <Cork> blinky_: $('ul#someList') => $('#someList')
[03:52:05] <Cork> an id can ever only be one element, no point in first selecting all uls
[03:52:17] <blinky_> ah true
[03:52:49] <Cork> sure, the browsers will optimize that most of the time, but... why not write the simpler selector
[03:52:49] <blinky_> dimi1947, ^^ Corks solution is better
[03:53:13] <blinky_> better to learn to write the code cleaner and better
[03:53:21] <Cork> not exactly better, it is more of a side note on the answer
[03:53:45] <Cork> .first() or :first-child is also alternatives
[03:53:54] <Cork> the later is fast if you can use it
[03:54:02] <Cork> *faster
[03:55:06] <hellyeah> hey
[03:55:14] <hellyeah> why it didnt return anything https://jsfiddle.net/2hmyz0um/1/
[03:55:50] <Cork> hellyeah: cause a jquery object won't ever be equal to a string
[03:56:01] <hellyeah> ic
[03:56:03] <hellyeah> op
[03:56:05] <hellyeah> ss
[03:56:10] <hellyeah> use text() there
[03:56:11] <hellyeah> i guess
[03:56:24] <Cork> .text() won't return &nbsp though
[03:56:46] <Cork> if you want the escaped string use .html
[03:57:46] <hellyeah> like null
[03:57:48] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:58:11] <Cork> if .text() or .html() return null it means the selector didn't match
[03:58:56] <hellyeah> there is null column there you see https://jsfiddle.net/2hmyz0um/4/ i want to check that how can i do this?
[04:02:08] <drake01> guessx: solved it.. actually it was: 'shown.bs.modal' event which wasn't working. so it was more of bootstrap.js issue. Thanks for your help! :)
[04:20:22] <`ULT> Hi, .append("<tr></tr>") is exately the same as .append("<tr>")?
[04:20:39] <Cork> yes
[04:20:39] <taplar> they have the same result, yeah
[04:20:51] <`ULT> can I read something more about that?
[04:21:00] <Cork> the later triggers jquerys createElement fast path
[04:21:03] <`ULT> I cant find it on the api
[04:22:00] <`ULT> cork, may I ask you why this is not working? $('#output').append($('<tr><td>', { text: title }));
[04:22:03] <Cork> `ULT: https://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#creating-new-elements
[04:22:10] <`ULT> thanks!
[04:22:20] <dimi1947> after asking earlier...about how to access a list item...I got this as a response... $('ul#headelem li:first')
[04:22:25] <Cork> `ULT: cause that is html, not hte fastpath
[04:22:25] <b-ot> Cork: memorised “ULT: cause that”.
[04:23:14] <hellyeah> i need to do some delegation
[04:23:17] <dimi1947> this code thouhg returns a bunch of data....is this what is suppose to happen?
[04:23:39] <hellyeah> do you suggest me to use delegate() function of jquery?
[04:23:43] <Cork> dimi1947: it should give you the first element jquery finds
[04:23:47] <taplar> hellyeah: use on()
[04:24:00] <Cork> though like said before don't use the ul tag name
[04:24:13] <taplar> $(parentSelector).on(event, childSelector, callback)
[04:24:40] <Cork> $('#headelem li:first') is the same thing as $('#headelem li').first() (except it triggers through sizzle and then calls back to .first())
[04:26:46] <dimi1947> I do not get what I want though...
[04:26:57] <Cork> make a fiddle
[04:27:01] <dimi1947> the text within the first li...
[04:27:05] <dimi1947> ok wait...
[04:31:11] <`ULT> Cork, one more questions. sorry for being noob. If I want insert a <tr> and <td> in #output. I need to add the full path: $('#output').append($('<tr><td>'+title+'</tr></td>'));
[04:31:17] <`ULT> And I can`t use the fast path?
[04:31:36] <Cork> i gave you how to do that
[04:31:57] <Cork> $('<tr>').append($('<th>', { text: title })) <--
[04:32:06] <`ULT> yes.
[04:32:06] <Cork> that will create the tr, and a child td
[04:32:12] <`ULT> Aah oke,
[04:32:13] <`ULT> I see
[04:32:14] <`ULT> sorry
[04:32:14] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/05sajs5n/   here is the fiddle cork
[04:32:15] <Cork> then just append that to the output
[04:32:27] <`ULT> I thougt you select the tr
[04:32:33] <`ULT> and put the th in it
[04:32:43] <`ULT> but you create also the tr?
[04:32:54] <taplar> dimi1947: if you want the text do text() off of it
[04:32:55] <Cork> dimi1947: and you want the email?
[04:33:01] <dimi1947> I want to get the email contained in the first li item...
[04:33:09] <`ULT> I cant understand that
[04:33:14] <dimi1947> yeah
[04:33:23] <Cork> dimi1947: https://jsfiddle.net/05sajs5n/1/
[04:34:06] <dimi1947> thanks..cork
[04:34:52] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/31he7kfd/ <--- why is this giving me Uncaught TypeError: Property 'login' of object [object Object] is not a function  at start up?
[04:36:05] <taplar> i'm assuming it's not defined yet
[04:37:32] <Uhkis> object most certainly is defined
[04:37:54] <taplar> i was referring to the function(s)
[04:38:20] <`ULT> Cork your line: $('<tr>').append($('<th>', { text: title })) is inserting <th>$varaiable</th> in an existing <tr> right?
[04:38:27] <`ULT> that is how i read it
[04:38:33] <Cork> no
[04:38:34] <`ULT> and can understand it
[04:38:40] <hellyeah> it reported tds.each is not a function what is the reason of that https://jsfiddle.net/njgk1xwp/8/
[04:38:46] <Cork> it creates a new tr, appends a td to it and returns the new objects
[04:38:53] <`ULT> hmm :p
[04:39:00] <Uhkis> taplar: ah, hadn't opened the fiddle yet
[04:39:05] <Cork> you then have to append that tr to the output
[04:39:08] <taplar> hellyeah: your missing your $ on your selector
[04:39:17] <taplar> you just have a string surrounded by ()
[04:39:18] <hellyeah> damn not again :/
[04:39:46] <QessT> I'm currently using progress bar from bootstrap
[04:40:07] <QessT> when it achieves 100% the bar dissapears. Is there a way to keep it so it wont go away?
[04:40:18] <taplar> hellyeah: also you don't have to do an each there
[04:40:30] <taplar> $tds.addClass('blah') would add the class to them all
[04:41:00] <hellyeah> yeah thats another issue i want to focus on
[04:41:23] <hellyeah> i just want to add class to the each first row of tbody tr td
[04:41:31] <hellyeah> first row of tbody tr sorry
[04:41:53] <taplar> uh, first cell?
[04:41:56] <taplar> tr is the row
[04:42:27] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/njgk1xwp/16/
[04:42:34] <`ULT> I dont get it cork. In the api I read this: $( ".container" ).append( $( "h2" ) );    >>  You can  select an element on the page and insert it into another
[04:42:37] <hellyeah> you see image button right
[04:42:55] <taplar> that's in the first cell
[04:42:56] <`ULT> that is exactely your code. I cant see it how your code is creating an element
[04:43:08] <hellyeah> i am confused
[04:43:23] <hellyeah> taplar:  okey i want to add class to first cell
[04:43:24] <Cork> `ULT: your skipping the existance of <>
[04:43:32] <`ULT> aah is that the part?
[04:43:45] <`ULT> that should be my next question :p
[04:43:51] <`ULT> what is the <> meaning
[04:44:19] <`ULT> I see it
[04:44:24] <Cork> that was what i linked to before
[04:44:25] <`ULT> thats make alot sence
[04:44:25] <hellyeah> taplar:  https://jsfiddle.net/njgk1xwp/17/
[04:44:30] <`ULT> sense
[04:44:35] <hellyeah> when you write each you are traversing td right
[04:44:37] <Cork> *that :)
[04:44:50] <hellyeah> eq(0) should give first cell of each tr
[04:44:59] <hellyeah> but element.eq(0) is not a function why
[04:45:49] <hellyeah> damn
[04:45:59] <hellyeah> element is just single element
[04:46:02] <hellyeah> damn
[04:46:06] <hellyeah> okey sorry
[04:46:19] <taplar> hellyeah: https://jsfiddle.net/njgk1xwp/18/
[04:49:17] <hellyeah> thats easy
[04:49:18] <hellyeah> DAMN
[04:49:25] <hellyeah> really dont need each
[04:49:29] <taplar> now here's another question
[04:49:34] <taplar> your generating the html, right?
[04:49:43] <hellyeah> asp.net generate it
[04:49:51] <taplar> can you modify that?
[04:49:55] <hellyeah> no
[04:50:04] <taplar> o.O
[04:50:21] <hellyeah> asp.net has server controls
[04:50:28] <hellyeah> that generate messy html markup
[04:50:49] <hellyeah> but i can add, remove or toggle class from js and play with it
[04:50:53] <hellyeah> i can design in css
[04:51:08] <hellyeah> js and css part is my territory in this case
[04:51:38] <`ULT> so this should  be the whole line $('#output').append($('<tr>').append($('<th>', { text: title })));
[04:51:45] <Cork> yes
[04:51:48] <`ULT> :D
[04:51:55] <`ULT> thanks!
[04:52:41] <`ULT> for me it is mutch more difficult to read than the simple. but unsave .html()
[04:53:41] <Cork> `ULT: ya, a better option is normally to use a template/template engine
[04:55:13] <hellyeah> ULT do you try to generate html markup from jquery?
[04:55:33] <`ULT> oke, this is what I want, maybe it is way to complex for the simple thing I am doing.
[04:55:39] <`ULT> 1 moment Make a fiddle
[04:56:00] <`ULT> * I make
[04:57:18] <Cork> `ULT: an option is to do var tr = $('<tr><th></th></td>'); tr.find('th').text(title); $('#output').html(tr); if you prefer that
[04:57:18] <b-ot> Cork: memorised “ULT: an option”.
[04:57:25] <Cork> b-ot: hush
[04:58:10] <Cork> `ULT: though about losing that ` in your nick? seams like it drives the bug crazy
[04:58:16] <Cork> *bot
[04:59:31] <`ULT> Haha yeah sorry, I will.
[04:59:33] <`ULT> `nick ULT
[04:59:43] <ULT> .
[04:59:54] <Cork> thx
[05:02:00] <ULT> This is what I want to achieve: http://prntscr.com/8j64am
[05:02:31] <Cork> that definitely looks like something you should keep as a template ya
[05:02:32] <ULT> I want the selected options and the option name in a litle table
[05:02:41] <ULT> 1 moment brb
[05:04:57] <Cork> ULT: http://jsfiddle.net/0jg4xexv/
[05:05:27] <Cork> is my recommendation for how to do that
[05:05:47] <Cork> and add classes if you need to identify specific rows or so on
[05:06:54] <ULT> looks great. will study it.
[05:09:47] <ULT> Is this some good reading for templates? http://www.borismoore.com/2010/09/introducing-jquery-templates-1-first.html
[05:09:54] <ULT> Or do you recommend something else?
[05:10:09] <Cork> that one is really old
[05:10:56] <Cork> if you want a template engine i recommend looking at jqote2, mustache or underscore
[05:11:13] <Cork> also for future reference
[05:11:18] <Cork> ?mdn template
[05:11:19] <b-ot> Cork: template - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template
[05:11:21] <taplar> i like to create small view templates and get them with ajax for use. field placement defined with classes and such
[05:11:29] <Cork> might be interesting, a bit early to use that just yet though
[05:11:44] <ULT> thanks will read :)
[05:11:51] <ULT> Never heared of templating :p
[05:11:55] <ULT> *heard
[05:11:57] <Cork> taplar: that can cause quite a bit of latency if your unlucky though
[05:13:10] <gandalfx> hi guys, I have a question
[05:13:25] <gandalfx> I'm listening to the 'mouseenter' event on a jquery-selected object
[05:13:36] <gandalfx> like $("something").on("mouseenter",listener);
[05:13:52] <gandalfx> however apparently jquery is simulating the mouseenter event via a mouseover event
[05:14:04] <gandalfx> so when I check the event type inside my listener, it says mouseover
[05:14:22] <Cork> yes, mouseenter/mouseleave is a fake event
[05:14:34] <gandalfx> $("something").on("mouseenter",function(e) { console.log(e.type) })
[05:14:35] <gandalfx> right
[05:14:39] <gandalfx> is this intended?
[05:14:45] <Cork> yes
[05:14:50] <gandalfx> it's very counterintuitive when you listen for an event and get a different one…
[05:15:10] <Cork> you can't get event type mouseenter, as there isn't an event like that
[05:15:24] <Cork> e.type is what the browser says it is
[05:15:35] <gandalfx> well first of all there is https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/mouseenter
[05:15:37] <taplar> is it just for readability?  enter/leave vs over/out?
[05:15:49] <Cork> no
[05:15:51] <gandalfx> no there is a difference taplar
[05:15:56] <Cork> over out fires for children too
[05:16:01] <gandalfx> ^
[05:16:05] <taplar> ah
[05:16:17] <gandalfx> Cork, but there is already evt.originalEvent
[05:16:26] <gandalfx> so why not set evt.type to the one that jquery uses?
[05:16:51] <Cork> not sure about the reasoning behind that
[05:17:03] <Cork> i've always seen it as obvious why it is like that
[05:17:24] <gandalfx> like I said, because I'm listening for one event .on("a") and I'm getting a different one evt.type="b"
[05:17:47] <Cork> ya, i get that you expect something else, but like i said, i expect it to be out
[05:17:52] <Cork> sorry over
[05:18:00] <gandalfx> okay lol
[05:18:11] <gandalfx> confused me
[05:18:16] <gandalfx> so can I rely on this?
[05:18:22] <Cork> might be cause i've written js for many many years before jquery was a thing :)
[05:18:33] <gandalfx> or is jquery going to use mouseenter at some point, since it's been gaining browser support
[05:18:46] <Cork> gandalfx: for as long as jquery fakes the mouseenter with mouseover
[05:18:56] <Cork> if it goes native it might not anymore
[05:19:08] <Cork> and jquery3 might be a good time for that
[05:19:09] <Cork> donno
[05:19:17] <gandalfx> I see
[05:19:26] <gandalfx> well then, thank you for your answers ;)
[05:19:30] <Cork> but ya, you can depend on 1.x and 2.x not to change that
[05:19:53] <Whiskey> Cork you mind look at alot of JavaScript? I don´t know if its jQuery related or clean JavaScript as it mixed a bit but it can be :)
[05:20:27] <Cork> Whiskey: not sure what your asking about
[05:20:44] <Cork> ya, i read js a lot, if that is what you ask
[05:20:54] <Cork> i read a lot of other languages too
[05:21:13] <Whiskey> If you don´t mind look in alot of JS code and try to find the problem :)
[05:21:30] <Whiskey> Im not sure if it is a problem, but it feels like it is
[05:22:07] <taplar> sounds like a doctor's visit
[05:22:09] <jquery521> Hey folks, has anyone ever had a problem where you're using slidedown() and a blank element slides down even though it has content?
[05:22:16] <Whiskey> hehe :D
[05:22:29] <jquery521> http://vag.wpengine.com/our-service/ if you click reveal solution you will see what I mean
[05:23:08] <jquery521> I'm half tempted to have an empty element, and bring it in after slidedown fires but I want to understand what is actually happening here
[05:23:39] <Whiskey> Cork, i have some timers running on the site, it updated every second as it count "up/down" and everyime this happen the mouse flutters. Im not sure if this has to be the case or if it can be fixed
[05:25:25] <taplar> jquery521: in ff i see it sometimes but not always, kinda inconsistent
[05:25:53] <taplar> ooooh, yeah, big time in chrome
[05:26:01] <taplar> i'm not getting the ipsum there
[05:26:17] <jquery521> taplar: yea, I can use a different method and make it work but I wish I understood what was actually going wrong
[05:28:49] <jquery521> taplar: I'm noticing if I adjust z-index's I can get a slightly more consistent result. THat's probably the main issue
[05:29:40] <taplar> oh, yeah, your div has a negative zindex
[05:31:12] <taplar> lol, though if i change it to 0, and then back to -1 it appears fine
[05:31:15] <taplar> weird
[05:38:17] <BostonGeorge2k> hi iam using a template which uses data-href="#section-services" tag to scroll to an area
[05:38:29] <BostonGeorge2k> how do i find out which functions handles the scrolling? i want to add some offsets
[05:41:09] <ULT> Hi cork, I have a question about the template
[05:41:46] <ULT> When I render the template, I dont know how many rows I have, the templating should be dynamic. That is not a problem?
[05:41:59] <Cork> nope
[05:42:14] <Cork> just loop the rows instead of having a static number
[05:42:18] <ULT> so i run througt a loop the options
[05:42:23] <ULT> yes that is what i thougt.
[05:42:29] <ULT> thx.
[05:44:13] <MXBrandon> how can I reference each element in a dynamically generated form with like field names?  Example:   <input type="text" name="qty[foo]" value="1" />   (where 'foo' is a part number)
[05:44:43] <Cork> MXBrandon: well you would have to have the number
[05:44:56] <Cork> (a better option is to give those elements a class and selecting on that)
[05:45:04] <MXBrandon> Trying $('#item_qtys).qty[123].value    (asssuming 123 is the num)
[05:45:15] <Cork> won't work
[05:45:48] <MXBrandon> so there is no way to reference the value, even if I know the qty?
[05:45:56] <MXBrandon> sorry, even if I know the part num I mean
[05:46:01] <Cork> you need to know the attribute value
[05:46:21] <Cork> you could use [name^="qty"]
[05:46:26] <MXBrandon> I do know the attribute value.    name="qty[123]" for example
[05:46:30] <Cork> but ya, it is normally a bad choice
[05:46:34] <MXBrandon> ok
[05:46:45] <MXBrandon> just use a dynamic class name instead?
[05:46:58] <Cork> $('#item_qtys input[name="qty[123]"]')
[05:47:13] <Cork> MXBrandon: well not dynamic
[05:47:21] <Cork> but ya, give the qty fields a class
[05:47:24] <Cork> and use that
[05:47:33] <Cork> $('#item_qtys .qty')
[05:48:24] <MXBrandon> how can I reference it based on the part num then?
[05:49:19] <MXBrandon> In short, I have an array of part nums. I want to loop through the array and then check what the form qty is (if the field exists).   So I would be referencing it by the actual part number
[05:49:34] <MXBrandon> so I could give each form value a unique class name
[05:49:58] <Cork> build the field name from the number
[05:50:05] <Cork> then filter based on that
[05:50:34] <Cork> $('#item_qtys .qty').filter('[name="qty[' + num + ']"]').val()
[05:51:29] <MXBrandon> gotcha, thanks!
[05:53:16] <mcfdez87> Hello. I'm trying to construct a multimdimensional array, but I not get result, Any suggestion please? https://jsfiddle.net/5vxs69pv/2/
[05:54:21] <hellyeah> hey
[05:54:49] <hellyeah> what i want to do is to add delegate to the button when you click button i want to get alert what am doing wrong here? https://jsfiddle.net/njgk1xwp/22/
[05:54:58] <MXBrandon> Cork: Thanks, that worked great
[06:04:42] <hellyeah> i try to add evet to the first cell which are buttons what did it do wrong here? https://jsfiddle.net/njgk1xwp/28/
[06:09:20] <BostonGeorge2k> hi there, here comes a bug that keeps me struggeling for days: https://jsfiddle.net/m1b89t7k/1/
[06:09:35] <BostonGeorge2k> if you click the link shortly one after another it might happend that two sections are shown
[06:09:56] <BostonGeorge2k> you'd need to click a little wild on different links to see this
[06:09:57] <BostonGeorge2k>  :)
[06:10:13] <taplar> hellyeah: you have a syntax error, check your console
[06:10:47] <Cork> BostonGeorge2k: you need to select all the "textWord" elements and do .stop() to abort the old animation
[06:11:01] <Cork> ?api stop
[06:11:01] <b-ot> Cork: .stop(): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[06:11:45] <hellyeah> taplar:  yeah i couldnt find it yet
[06:12:12] <hellyeah> damn
[06:12:41] <BostonGeorge2k> textWord elements?
[06:13:02] <BostonGeorge2k> ahh
[06:13:04] <BostonGeorge2k> ^^ ok thanks
[06:13:22] <hellyeah> taplar:  fixed syntax issue https://jsfiddle.net/njgk1xwp/31/ but it didnt add delegate to the button https://jsfiddle.net/njgk1xwp/31/
[06:14:01] <taplar> uh, that's not a delegate
[06:14:24] <taplar> $(parent).on(event, childSelector, handler)
[06:15:02] <BostonGeorge2k> you sir, are a genuius - what an easy fix
[06:15:17] <hellyeah> humm
[06:17:14] <taplar> also line 17 you were doing a function invocation, not giving it just the definition
[06:17:51] <hellyeah> taplar:  what about this https://jsfiddle.net/njgk1xwp/35/
[06:18:14] <taplar> no, your missing the point of delegates
[06:18:27] <taplar> and your line 16 is still executing the function
[06:18:40] <taplar> the point of delegates is to put it once on a parent element and let the event bubble up
[06:18:55] <taplar> so children can change and they don't have to have the event bound to them
[06:19:42] <hellyeah> you ad event to element right_
[06:19:46] <hellyeah> add*
[06:19:52] <taplar> the parent element
[06:20:04] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:20:11] <hellyeah> tbody tr in that case
[06:20:18] <taplar> or table
[06:20:21] <taplar> or tbody
[06:20:34] <taplar> since they are singletons
[06:21:13] <hellyeah> actually i want to add event only first cell of tbody tr
[06:21:26] <taplar> that's fine, your child filter will take care of that
[06:21:35] <taplar> that's what the 'childSelector' is for
[06:25:53] <hellyeah> hmm,
[06:26:06] <hellyeah> select tbody tr
[06:28:15] <ULT> hi cork, why should this not working? http://jsfiddle.net/0jg4xexv/2/
[06:28:43] <ULT> nvm
[06:28:46] <Cork> ULT: div can't have tr
[06:28:47] <ULT> forgot the table lines
[06:28:53] <ULT> true
[06:30:10] <Cork> ULT: also i brain farted with the template code...
[06:30:30] <DukeDrake> hi
[06:30:41] <Cork> ULT: http://jsfiddle.net/0jg4xexv/3/
[06:31:08] <zumba_addict> good morning folks. I'm debugging a code which uses $deferred. I'm inside .fail() in a breakpoint. I need the options that was used on the ajax call. However, first param shows the promise. The second and third shows a string which is the error.
[06:31:44] <Cork> zumba_addict: the fail might not be network related
[06:31:54] <Cork> check the third argument
[06:32:05] <zumba_addict> both values are "timeout"
[06:32:14] <Cork> ah
[06:32:15] <zumba_addict> i purposely made it fail by setting timeout to 50ms
[06:32:27] <ULT> oke you changed var rows = template.children(); in  var rows = template.filter('tr');
[06:32:28] <zumba_addict> because I am writing a capture
[06:32:30] <ULT> this is better?
[06:32:58] <ULT> and you added .parseHTML
[06:32:59] <zumba_addict> the first param response shows promise where one of the methods is getAllResponseHeaders
[06:33:07] <zumba_addict> i don't know if that will help me though
[06:34:15] <DukeDrake> can someone help me figure out, how to execute one function with a different jquery version (with noconflict), while all other functions should run with another version?
[06:34:33] <zumba_addict> Cork: here it is - http://imgur.com/F3oNxAO
[06:34:52] <Cork> zumba_addict: ya, i'm reading the code
[06:35:10] <zumba_addict> k
[06:35:33] <Cork> the timeout is handled with set setTimeout and depending on the situation it fires an .abort on the xhr
[06:35:37] <zumba_addict> i'm not sure why on my other code(actually team's old code), I am able to get the options on the third param
[06:35:46] <Cork> so ya, it can't always give you an xhr object
[06:35:48] <zumba_addict> yup, i'm aware of the timeout
[06:36:28] <taplar> DukeDrake: that seems strange.  but what you might could do is pull in one version, save off jQuery to some other variable, then pull in the other version and do the same, so then you'd have the two different jQuery variables
[06:36:35] <zumba_addict> on the other code, I also use timeout set to 50ms to trigger the error and I see the options get populated
[06:36:51] <zumba_addict> i noticed this happens when it uses the other dev's retryfetch code
[06:37:02] <zumba_addict> via ajaxprefilter
[06:38:14] <zumba_addict> Cork: I am using this to capture jsonp error as a magic workaround - if (_.has(options, 'jsonpCallback') && options.jsonpCallback.indexOf('callback_') !== -1 ) {
[06:38:26] <zumba_addict> that's inside .fail and it works great on the other code
[06:38:53] <zumba_addict> on the other code though, it's not using .fail but we are using error
[06:39:35] <zumba_addict> the other one is not a promise but this one that can't capture the error is a promise
[06:39:47] <zumba_addict> it's wrapped with $.deferred
[06:43:45] <DukeDrake> taplar: well .. all currently existing functions ought to use '$' ... but I start to understand how noconflict works ... ^
[06:46:12] <taplar> right, but no conflict deals with the $ symbol, not the 'jQuery' variable that both versions would be using
[06:46:32] <taplar> so as soon as you pull in a second version of jquery it would replace that variable, i would assume
[06:46:39] <taplar> so if you want both, you'd need to save it off
[06:47:16] <DukeDrake> hmmm ..... I'll got engineer some ...
[07:00:00] <zumba_addict> I posted it in so Cork :) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32718674/capture-3rd-param-output-of-deferred-in-a-fail-situation
[07:08:15] <Kartagis> http://termbin.com/6e5y why am I getting Unexpected token switch?
[07:08:56] <Kartagis> the missing } is actually there
[07:09:05] <Cork> Kartagis: remove the paranteses around the case value
[07:09:24] <shoky> zumba_addict:  you can get the options by referencing "this" inside the callback. assuming you don't re-bind "this" to something else, like you're doing :)
[07:09:24] <Cork> also you most likely way a break; after the action
[07:09:29] <Cork> or 0 will do all of them
[07:09:38] <Kartagis> case 0 and so on?
[07:09:41] <Cork> yes
[07:09:52] <Cork> case falls through just like in c
[07:12:51] <Kartagis> same error
[07:13:33] <hellyeah> what errors
[07:13:34] <zumba_addict> shoky: just saw your response
[07:13:37] <hellyeah> i didnt see any errors
[07:13:48] <hellyeah> where is that DAMN error
[07:13:57] <shoky> zumba_addict: ah, just replied on SO too
[07:14:03] <zumba_addict> oh
[07:14:05] <zumba_addict> checking it now
[07:14:36] <Kartagis> I got why
[07:14:50] <zumba_addict> testing it now :)
[07:14:54] * hellyeah i dont understand anything
[07:15:30] <hellyeah> taplar:  you still around
[07:15:36] <taplar> yup
[07:16:07] <Kamuela> if I used jquery selectors on an svg to edit the image, could I actually save that new image from the browser?
[07:16:12] <hellyeah> i try another approach https://jsfiddle.net/njgk1xwp/38/ are you okey with that or should write this again with "on"
[07:16:50] <taplar> i would still suggest a delegate listener
[07:17:00] <hellyeah> won ?
[07:17:02] <hellyeah> ops
[07:17:03] <hellyeah> on
[07:17:06] <taplar> yes
[07:17:18] <hellyeah> any spesific reason?
[07:17:35] <hellyeah> hm
[07:17:40] <taplar> it's unnecessary to bind to every element.  that's multiple handlers for the same logic
[07:18:05] <hellyeah> ic
[07:18:06] <hellyeah> so
[07:18:21] <zumba_addict> shoky: the "this" has value but this.options doesn't have the property I need. And it looks like it's changed
[07:18:23] <hellyeah> i need parents of td right
[07:18:36] <taplar> the tbody or table will work for that
[07:18:36] <zumba_addict> should I do a var self = this in $.when?
[07:18:51] <hellyeah> closest('tbody')
[07:18:53] <hellyeah> ?
[07:19:02] <taplar> no
[07:19:06] <taplar> just select it
[07:19:07] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:19:13] <hellyeah> select tbody
[07:19:17] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:19:17] <shoky> zumba_addict: not this.options,  just this
[07:19:36] <zumba_addict> the just this is big
[07:19:43] <developer818> Stuck on this...I’d like to put the results in the drop down. What am I missing to complete this function? https://jsfiddle.net/2md7b65m/
[07:19:45] <taplar> similar to how your getting the $tds variable, just don't go down that far
[07:19:47] <Mariaa> Hi
[07:19:55] <Mariaa> i cant make the jquery tabs to work http://tinyurl.com/oww4zk7
[07:19:56] <shoky> zumba_addict: it should be the full options, yeah might be big
[07:20:07] <Mariaa> although i have enqued everything correctly
[07:20:13] <zumba_addict> i don't see the property jsonpCallback in "this"
[07:20:29] <zumba_addict> it's a real jsonp call
[07:20:40] <zumba_addict> I see the callback response in network tav
[07:20:42] <zumba_addict> tab
[07:20:50] <hellyeah> taplar:  can you point me out to right direction?
[07:21:21] <taplar> i just did.  like your getting the $tds, select your tbody.  and then delegate bind on it
[07:21:28] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/8ej8muze/
[07:21:33] <Mariaa> i dont get an error with .tabs() too, any suggestion?
[07:21:46] <taplar> you don't use an each
[07:21:50] <taplar> just bind to the tbody
[07:21:51] <hellyeah> click, childSelector, function
[07:22:01] <taplar> !g jquery on()
[07:22:02] <b-ot> taplar: .on() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:22:09] <shoky> zumba_addict: and you've set jsonpCallback to something else ?
[07:22:18] <zumba_addict> shoky  - http://imgur.com/6AAxMXv
[07:22:21] <hellyeah> taplar:  https://jsfiddle.net/8ej8muze/1/
[07:22:28] <zumba_addict> yes, I did set it manually
[07:22:40] <shoky> zumba_addict: ok right that's not the options object heh
[07:22:52] <zumba_addict> i learned last week that if I didn't set it, the options will not have it
[07:22:55] <shoky> zumba_addict: so somewhere you're re-binding "this" for that callback
[07:22:57] <taplar> you got a syntax error with the extra }); i believe
[07:22:59] <zumba_addict> k
[07:23:08] <shoky> zumba_addict:  for example that _.bind thing you were doing  doe that
[07:23:10] <shoky> does that
[07:23:17] <zumba_addict> yes, we are doing that
[07:23:22] <hellyeah> taplar:  i fixed the syntax https://jsfiddle.net/8ej8muze/2/
[07:23:28] <shoky> right, so that changes what "this" points to
[07:23:28] <zumba_addict> not sure why they are doing that
[07:23:34] <shoky> don't do that if you want the original "this" :p
[07:23:40] <zumba_addict> ok
[07:23:42] <taplar> hellyeah: yep, now, fix your childselector
[07:23:53] <zumba_addict> i don't want to touch it because it might screw it up
[07:23:54] <DukeDrake> cool, the noConflict thing works =)
[07:23:55] <hellyeah> tr:first-child
[07:23:58] <zumba_addict> what's the workaround?
[07:24:16] <hellyeah> what did i do wrong now https://jsfiddle.net/8ej8muze/4/
[07:24:18] <shoky> zumba_addict:  it shouldn't screw it up
[07:24:37] <taplar> i thought you wanted it to fire on the click of the first td
[07:24:39] <zumba_addict> they might ask me, why did you remove it
[07:24:56] <taplar> the same elements you previously put the class 'booya' on
[07:24:56] <zumba_addict> what is bind for? for keeping context?
[07:25:00] <shoky> and you'll have an answer for them
[07:25:08] <shoky> "i don't want this to be re-bound"
[07:25:22] <zumba_addict> ok. I mean what's the purpose of rebounding?
[07:25:40] <shoky> it's for changing what "this" points to in a function,  like if you want to access some object of yours via "this"  inside the callback
[07:25:42] <codin_> Hi.. how to make this repeat after 10 seconds ---> http://jsfiddle.net/bdpo8zsq/1/
[07:25:56] <hellyeah> setTimeout
[07:25:58] <zumba_addict> got it
[07:26:10] <zumba_addict> and since this is only an error, there is no need :)
[07:26:20] <zumba_addict> i want it as simple as possible
[07:26:22] <shoky> probably
[07:26:26] <zumba_addict> cool
[07:26:28] <shoky> as simple as possible?
[07:26:31] <codin_> hellyeah: I've tried but it wont listen to the code .. :P
[07:26:43] <shoky> you've long ago gave up on simplicity :)
[07:26:47] <shoky> jsonp and all
[07:26:53] <zumba_addict> :D
[07:27:06] <hellyeah> wwhat is 8000 for
[07:27:07] <hellyeah> ?
[07:27:10] <zumba_addict> i noticed they have one code there that access a property, let me check if it it's still going to work
[07:27:21] <hellyeah> animation will repeat in that time?
[07:27:37] <codin_> hellyeah: look here with setTimeout --> http://jsfiddle.net/bdpo8zsq/2/
[07:27:47] <zumba_addict> in layman's term, does bind also mean combine?
[07:27:48] <hellyeah> taplar:  any suggestion?
[07:28:05] <taplar> for what?
[07:28:19] <codin_> hellyeah if you see my code now it has timeout ---> http://jsfiddle.net/bdpo8zsq/2/
[07:28:27] <shoky> zumba_addict: it literally does exactly what i said,  changes what "this" points to in the function
[07:28:33] <hellyeah> taplar:  wont work :D
[07:28:35] <Mariaa> anyone?
[07:28:41] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/8ej8muze/4/
[07:28:41] <codin_> hellyeah :  but it dont work? I count to 3 seconds and it starts
[07:28:41] <Mariaa> i cant make the jquery tabs to work http://tinyurl.com/oww4zk7
[07:28:45] <Mariaa> i dont get an error with .tabs() too, any suggestion?
[07:28:48] <zumba_addict> k
[07:29:17] <hellyeah> codin_:  in your first paste what is 8000 for
[07:29:26] <taplar> hellyeah: i already commented on that.  you said you wanted it to fire when clicking the first td.  the same elements you previously put the class 'booya' on, no?
[07:29:37] <zumba_addict> i'm testing it now without the bind
[07:29:48] <codin_> hellyeah : its the time it for the walking man to go from left to right
[07:30:11] <hellyeah> taplar:  thats right
[07:30:12] <codin_> that is 8000
[07:30:33] <hellyeah> DAMN
[07:30:39] <hellyeah> forgot to include jquery
[07:30:50] <hellyeah> ic
[07:31:05] <hellyeah> codin_:  i am not expert but the only solution seems to use setTimeout
[07:31:08] <zumba_addict> shoky: it works but now, how do I access the property that they were accessing it before?
[07:31:34] <codin_> hellyeah : can you try at this one --> http://jsfiddle.net/bdpo8zsq/2/
[07:31:38] <shoky> zumba_addict:  you can do  var self = this;  outside the callback or something like that
[07:31:49] <shoky> zumba_addict and access that property via self
[07:31:49] <zumba_addict> cool
[07:31:52] <hellyeah> ic the man here
[07:31:58] <hellyeah> it worked
[07:31:58] <codin_> it has timeout set BUT it just work first time
[07:32:03] <zumba_addict> i also noticed the property is also in "this"
[07:32:05] <zumba_addict> :D
[07:32:10] <shoky> o
[07:32:20] <shoky> that's odd. i think?
[07:32:24] <hellyeah> you want man to walk from left to right in every 10 secs right
[07:32:30] <zumba_addict> thanks a lot buddy! I learned a lot today :D
[07:32:37] <shoky> heh yw
[07:32:45] <zumba_addict> i need to do more bind examples
[07:32:51] <zumba_addict> this way, i'll become comfortable
[07:36:04] <zumba_addict> i'm trying out var self = this now
[07:37:32] <zumba_addict> yahoo, it worked too :)
[07:41:37] <Mariaa> can any help me?
[07:41:49] <BostonGeorge2k> hi i am using jquery.fittext to make change the font size of my icons to make em look more responsive
[07:42:06] <BostonGeorge2k> but the boxes in which the icons are are not sized properly http://i.imgur.com/6m8xPm5.png
[07:42:13] <tommys> hey! for some reason $(".someClass").hover() works for me while $(".someClass").mouseover() doesn't any idea why?
[07:42:35] <BostonGeorge2k> i can make them appear in the same height :/
[07:42:37] <BostonGeorge2k> cant*
[07:43:12] <Respek> BostonGeorge2k maybe a minheight?
[07:43:34] <BostonGeorge2k> hm but set to what?
[07:44:06] <BostonGeorge2k> the boxes are resizing with its content
[07:44:28] <BostonGeorge2k> icons get smaller meaning the boxes get smaller
[07:46:09] <Respek> if *icons* (size) (minheight) = X
[07:46:12] <Respek> or somesuch?
[07:46:46] <BostonGeorge2k> hm ill give it another go
[07:47:23] <tommys> hey! for some reason $(".someClass").hover() works for me while $(".someClass").mouseenter() doesn't any idea why?
[07:52:46] <codin_> now it works --> http://jsfiddle.net/bdpo8zsq/5/
[07:52:47] <codin_> =)
[07:53:04] <tommys> hey! for some reason $(".someClass").hover() works for me whentaking the cursor inside the element, while $(".someClass").mouseenter() doesn't :( any ideas how can that even happen?
[07:53:20] <tommys> made it a bit more clearer :S
[08:15:14] <m2n> Hey guys , just a quick question, when we use $. what exactly it's pointing to ? (to the dom ?) like when we use $.ajax(), where exactly the ajax method applies to ?
[08:15:51] <MXBrandon> its referring to the jQuery object
[08:17:02] <MXBrandon> m2n: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8667736/what-does-the-sign-mean-in-jquery-or-javascript
[08:21:01] <m2n> ohk, so it's mean that we are applying the method (ajax here) on a jquery object.. ( which happens to have no selector)
[08:22:05] <MXBrandon> yes
[08:22:24] <m2n> thanks MXBrandon ! :)
[08:22:27] <MXBrandon> no prob
[08:23:04] <MXBrandon> Note that some other libraries use that for shorthand as well, so thats when you need to either use jQuery.ajax() in your case, or put jquery into compatibility mode
[08:23:49] <nirakara> given a caption with text length L, how to proportion a timing in milliseconds by L bounded to some N when L tends to infinity? sounds like i need a log...
[08:48:05] <juanpablob> hello everyone! I'm running jquery 10.11 and trigger('change') is not working. Any ideas why? Thank you!
[08:50:49] <shoky_> `demo @ juanpablob
[08:51:02] <shoky_> ?demo
[08:51:02] <b-ot> shoky_: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:51:10] <SPLENDID> hi!
[08:51:22] <juanpablob> shoky_, wait
[08:51:35] <SPLENDID> I have a mouseout event on an element. It doesn't fire when I slide out the element via .effect
[08:51:41] <SPLENDID> How can I fix this?
[08:52:02] <duch_kazatel> abstract the code out into a function and explicitly call it.
[08:52:16] <SPLENDID> duch_kazatel: I was hoping to avoid that
[08:52:28] <duch_kazatel> why?
[08:52:36] <duch_kazatel> naming functions and abstraction are awesome.
[08:52:55] <duch_kazatel> i mean, you could be weird and use .trigger('mouseout') but using the DOM to proxy logic is weird.
[08:52:55] <SPLENDID> duch_kazatel: sure. But having to explicitly call it seems redundant
[08:53:10] <duch_kazatel> not at all.  the function is the self-contained bit of logic.
[08:53:14] <duch_kazatel> you want to run that logic in some cases.
[08:53:17] <SPLENDID> duch_kazatel: the mouse is basically out of the element at the point where it slides away from the mouse
[08:58:08] <BostonGeorge2k> why does jquery.mobile resize my header?
[08:59:19] <labsy> hi all. I want to autoscroll whenever a chat message comes in my div.
[08:59:31] <labsy> so I did this: $('.comment :last').animate({scrollTop: $('.comment :last').prop("scrollHeight")}, 500);
[08:59:38] <BostonGeorge2k> sticky-header gets added automtically when i include the file
[08:59:54] <labsy> and it works. but after a while (after 50 messages or so) the scrollbar is moving again
[08:59:57] <labsy> to the top.
[09:00:03] <labsy> any hints?
[09:00:18] <duch_kazatel> labsy set the scrolltop to the scrollheight of the element.
[09:00:28] <labsy> duch_kazatel: like above?
[09:00:38] <duch_kazatel> .scrollHeight()
[09:00:46] <duch_kazatel> and of the entire box.
[09:00:51] <labsy> ok
[09:00:58] <duch_kazatel> BostonGeorge2k maybe http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/toolbar-fixed-fullscreen/ helps?
[09:02:09] <tehopeologist> how can i select an element with ANYTHING in a data attribute?  eg: $('.element[data-attr="*"]')  doesn't work
[09:02:24] <duch_kazatel> use a filter instead, tehopeologist
[09:02:49] <duch_kazatel> $('element').filter(function() { return $(this).data('something').length });
[09:02:54] <tehopeologist> well i just want to select elements that have the data attribute
[09:03:00] <BostonGeorge2k> no it does not
[09:03:08] <duch_kazatel> data attributes are slow.  also, if you use .data(), you can't select them your way anyway.
[09:03:12] <tehopeologist> tried just doing .element[data-attr] and that didn't work
[09:03:21] <duch_kazatel> tehopeologist right, use filter.
[09:03:24] <tehopeologist> hm ok
[09:04:02] <tehopeologist> i have like 335 items i need to check, though =/
[09:04:03] <tehopeologist> shit
[09:04:09] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:04:09] <duch_kazatel> so?
[09:04:20] <duch_kazatel> .filter() will be faster than any attribute selectors.
[09:04:21] <tehopeologist> ok
[09:04:25] <tehopeologist> thanks man
[09:06:26] <BostonGeorge2k> originally i wasnt using js/jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.js and my #header only gets the class "sticky-header" when I scroll. but after including the .js the #header gets intialized with the class sticky-header
[09:06:32] <BostonGeorge2k> i have no idea why
[09:06:52] <duch_kazatel> BostonGeorge2k you probably have a data attribute or something somewhere causing that to happen.
[09:07:17] <BostonGeorge2k> <header id="header" data-sticky-class="not-dark">
[09:07:23] <BostonGeorge2k> this is my header
[09:07:39] <duch_kazatel> dunno!  how can we help without seeing the broken page?
[09:07:48] <BostonGeorge2k> yea..
[09:07:54] <BostonGeorge2k> you cant :D
[09:11:16] <labsy> no it does not work
[09:11:23] <labsy> after a while it stopt autoscrolling.
[09:11:29] <labsy> *stops
[09:11:33] <Kamuela> does an svg in an object tag get inserted into the DOM?
[09:11:45] <duch_kazatel> labsy make a fiddle.
[09:13:45] <BostonGeorge2k> i hate that addon
[09:13:55] <duch_kazatel> what addon?
[09:14:01] <BostonGeorge2k> jquery.mobile
[09:14:09] <duch_kazatel> you mean jquery mobile?
[09:14:17] <duch_kazatel> not sure why you keep putting a dot in there haha
[09:14:48] <BostonGeorge2k> yea
[09:14:52] <BostonGeorge2k> jquery.mobile
[09:14:53] <BostonGeorge2k> :)
[09:15:04] <duch_kazatel> wut
[09:15:05] <BostonGeorge2k> its screws my header
[09:15:11] <BostonGeorge2k> i dont know why
[09:15:15] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you're maybe doing something wrong.
[09:15:32] <BostonGeorge2k> i was just adding the file to my code
[09:15:36] <BostonGeorge2k> ->screwed
[09:15:53] <duch_kazatel> you consider submitting a bug?
[09:16:17] <BostonGeorge2k> not sure how i would explain it
[09:16:20] <BostonGeorge2k> i dont have an exmaple live
[09:16:21] <codin_> Hi
[09:16:30] <duch_kazatel> make a standalone use case.
[09:16:38] <BostonGeorge2k> yea well no^^
[09:16:43] <duch_kazatel> er.
[09:16:43] <BostonGeorge2k> i get rid of it
[09:16:45] <codin_> how to fix loop for 3 seconds everytime ---> http://jsfiddle.net/bdpo8zsq/5/
[09:16:50] <duch_kazatel> then something tells me it's not jquery's fault ;)
[09:17:11] <BostonGeorge2k> could be idk
[09:17:16] <BostonGeorge2k> i am not that experienced
[09:18:56] <BostonGeorge2k> the problem i am seeing is
[09:19:15] <BostonGeorge2k> after including the file the whole page gets scrolled down a little but the scrollbar doesnt move at all
[09:19:24] <BostonGeorge2k> though i can scroll up a couple px using the mouse wheel
[09:19:55] <BostonGeorge2k> which proably causes the "sticky-header problem"
[09:22:38] <duch_kazatel> labsy http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7y13urhu/
[09:23:39] <codin_> help --> http://jsfiddle.net/bdpo8zsq/6/
[09:24:40] <duch_kazatel> codin_ use a recursive timeout call.
[09:25:12] <codin_> duch_kazatel Im using timeout call now
[09:25:25] <codin_> but it still not work
[09:25:33] <duch_kazatel> right, you need a recursive timeout call.
[09:25:40] <codin_> recursive how to use that
[09:25:42] <codin_> thats new =)
[09:27:01] <duch_kazatel> you're almost there actually.
[09:27:18] <codin_> duch_kazatel ok ,, whats the last part ?
[09:27:25] <duch_kazatel> woops.
[09:28:00] <duch_kazatel> codin_ you're really close for what it's worth.
[09:28:21] <codin_> duch_kazatel ok can u help me with the last part?
[09:28:34] <codin_> if u know it?
[09:28:40] <duch_kazatel> notice how the code just runs over and over.
[09:28:50] <duch_kazatel> instead of waiting 3 seconds every time?
[09:29:00] <codin_> yeahs... it start with 3second at start then 0 seconds
[09:29:06] <duch_kazatel> you're not telling it to wait every time - you just do .show(runIt)
[09:29:08] <duch_kazatel> sooo...
[09:29:20] <duch_kazatel> so move the part that does the waiting to replace that bit.
[09:30:40] <codin_> duch_kazatel move runIt(); outside?
[09:30:47] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bdpo8zsq/7/
[09:30:48] <duch_kazatel> like this.
[09:34:30] <duch_kazatel> codin_ get the idea?
[09:35:12] <codin_> duch_kazatel yeah im reading it
[09:36:15] <codin_> duch_kazatel U have Timeout inside
[09:36:19] <codin_> now I see =)
[09:37:52] <ULT> Hi, what is the best way to run trought an array, for loop?
[09:38:01] <duch_kazatel> forEach()
[09:39:42] <duch_kazatel> for loops are wonky.
[09:39:42] <ULT> oke
[09:39:47] <ULT> realy?
[09:39:50] <duch_kazatel> mmhmm..
[09:40:54] <duch_kazatel> forEach() is much more readable - myArray.forEach(addStatToPage);
[09:41:31] <ULT> the main differnt is the scope and break out of the loop I see
[09:41:42] <duch_kazatel> scope is important.
[09:41:43] <ULT> and indeed the way of writing
[09:41:50] <duch_kazatel> don't break out of the loop - that doesn't make sense.
[09:42:09] <duch_kazatel> if you need to break out, you're usually testing if the array has something.  there are methods for that kind of work.
[09:42:34] <ULT> thanks, will try to get it working with the forEach()
[09:42:45] <duch_kazatel> what're you trying to do?
[09:43:09] <ULT> 1 moment
[09:46:29] <ULT> I would show the selected option value and title using a template.
[09:46:47] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:46:49] <blakespo1> Hi
[09:47:01] <duch_kazatel> ULT are you working with a jquery object?
[09:47:06] <ULT> I have a screenshot.
[09:47:07] <blakespo1> I have a $(window).scroll(function(e) { ...
[09:47:17] <duch_kazatel> ULT screenshots are rarely helpful.
[09:47:23] <blakespo1> That is checking distance of a div from top of browser and doing something
[09:47:24] <ULT> This is what I want to achieve: http://prntscr.com/8j64am
[09:47:34] <blakespo1> by I don't want it to do that somethung until the scrolling has stopped
[09:47:37] <ULT> than you can see what i mean. my english is not that good.
[09:47:38] <blakespo1> How can I do that?
[09:47:45] <duch_kazatel> blakespo1 you want a debounce
[09:47:56] <blakespo1> yea?
[09:48:06] <duch_kazatel> ULT so you want the selected value?
[09:48:19] <ULT> yes, and the title of the option
[09:48:19] <duch_kazatel> ULT are you using radio buttons?
[09:48:25] <ULT> right.
[09:48:29] <ULT> i have a fiddle
[09:48:31] <duch_kazatel> yeah, you don't want to loop at all.
[09:48:37] <duch_kazatel> forEach() is not what you want for the jquery object.
[09:48:50] <ULT> 1 moment duch_kazatel, i make a fiddle
[09:51:14] <duch_kazatel> ULT http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5t9wwos1/
[09:53:47] <ULT> but to display the title and value in a row I need trought a loop?
[09:53:50] <ULT> http://jsfiddle.net/8222jm8x/
[09:53:57] <duch_kazatel> What do you mean "title"?
[09:54:29] <codin_> duch_kazatel if I want audio do I do something like this then ---> http://jsfiddle.net/bdpo8zsq/8/
[09:54:33] <duch_kazatel> you mean the current section, ULT?
[09:55:07] <duch_kazatel> codin_ did you try?
[09:55:12] <ULT> title is the bold part (* Kleur, Lengte, etcetera.)
[09:55:23] <codin_> yeah.. no sound yet .. :P
[09:55:55] <ULT> do you have checked the screenshot? :p
[09:55:55] <duch_kazatel> ULT easy.  no need for a loop ther,e either. just some simple markup and dom traversal.
[09:56:23] <ULT> hmm, but the rows are dynamic, I dont know exactely witch rows I need to show.
[09:56:30] <duch_kazatel> let me show you.
[09:56:33] <duch_kazatel> you're overcomplicating it.
[09:56:40] <ULT> So I thougt running trought all the titles and the seleced values
[09:56:45] <ULT> and showing them.
[09:56:51] <duch_kazatel> no.
[09:56:54] <ULT> :p
[09:56:56] <duch_kazatel> that's... making it too hard.
[09:57:02] <ULT> oke!
[09:57:48] <circ-user-fa5Ss> hi
[09:58:52] <duch_kazatel> ULT http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5t9wwos1/2/
[09:58:53] <ULT> In my preview line 10  <div id="output"></div> need to be  <table id="output"></table>
[09:59:09] <ULT> cool, great :)
[09:59:17] <ULT> let me check your code.
[09:59:23] <duch_kazatel> the basic idea is there.
[09:59:43] <ULT> this is what I want indeed.
[09:59:49] <codin_> duch_kazatel now audio work, but he stopped walking .----> http://jsfiddle.net/bdpo8zsq/9/
[10:00:41] <duch_kazatel> ...
[10:00:53] <duch_kazatel> you don't see the issue?
[10:01:16] <duch_kazatel> i don't see a $('#santasleight2') anywhere on that page ;)
[10:01:56] <codin_> duch_kazatel oh lol
[10:02:06] <ULT> and duch_kazatel, when we have more than 1 option. We still dont need a loop? :p
[10:02:16] <ULT> Like: http://jsfiddle.net/5t9wwos1/3/
[10:02:18] <duch_kazatel> ULT why would you ever loop?
[10:02:37] <duch_kazatel> so you want one for each group?
[10:02:51] <duch_kazatel> in that case, you need to modify your markup a little.
[10:03:31] <ULT> I want a resume from all the selected options
[10:03:47] <duch_kazatel> do you have any control over the html side?
[10:04:42] <ULT> yes.
[10:04:46] <duch_kazatel> because the Right Way™ to handle this is to have your html output that summary setup for you, and then just udpate.
[10:05:58] <ULT> uhm, you mean show the values with php and update it live with jquery/ javascript?
[10:06:14] <duch_kazatel> i don't know what you mean by "show the values with php"
[10:06:22] <duch_kazatel> let me give you the basic idea.
[10:06:30] <ULT> there is an array (php) witch store the option titles and values
[10:10:08] <duch_kazatel> ult http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5t9wwos1/4/
[10:11:11] <duch_kazatel> get the idea?
[10:11:36] <ULT> Yes. This is exactely what I want. But we have one problem. The rows are dynamic. So I dont know exactely witch rows to show.
[10:11:45] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:11:47] <ULT> I mean the last part.
[10:12:01] <ULT> It are products with differnt options. Do you know what I mean?
[10:12:13] <duch_kazatel> see how the data-result and data-group and how you tie things together?
[10:12:16] <ULT> Product #1 has some options and product #2 some others
[10:12:24] <duch_kazatel> check out the markup.
[10:12:28] <duch_kazatel> that's how things are separated.
[10:13:00] <ULT> <div class="summary">
[10:13:00] <ULT> 	<p data-result="color1">Color: <span></span></p>
[10:13:00] <ULT> 	<p data-result="color2">Color 2: <span></span></p>
[10:13:00] <ULT> </div>
[10:13:03] <ULT> sorry for posting code.
[10:13:08] <duch_kazatel> please don't paste into the channel :)
[10:13:09] <ULT> this part I cant code.
[10:13:14] <duch_kazatel> why not?
[10:13:18] <duch_kazatel> your php should have all that info,.
[10:13:26] <ULT> Yeah, thats true! :p
[10:13:28] <ULT> haha
[10:13:42] <ULT> you are right. So it will be a combination php with javascript
[10:13:58] <BostonGeorge2k> hey i am trying to make a a fiddle using an external resource. i have added the resource but the function is not available https://jsfiddle.net/m1b89t7k/7/
[10:14:11] <BostonGeorge2k> "sticky is not a function"
[10:14:21] <ULT> Than i understand you fiddle. It is working so it need to work. Thanks!
[10:15:12] <ULT> So that is what you mean by html output that summary setup
[10:15:35] <duch_kazatel> ULT right - don't have your JS do your basic setup sort for you.
[10:15:49] <duch_kazatel> BostonGeorge2k https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m1b89t7k/8/
[10:15:59] <duch_kazatel> drop the http: part from the external resource url.

[10:19:34] <BostonGeorge2k> ooh that^^ thanks
[10:20:14] <duch_kazatel> oh, protocol matching.  so yeah, dropping the http: part would have worked, as well.

[10:26:07] <HoNgOuRu> Im trying to detect url changes in a chrome extension
[10:26:26] <HoNgOuRu> is hashchange the right thing to look for ?
[10:26:34] <duch_kazatel> that's for anything after #

[10:27:21] <plamb> jquery is acting weird
[10:27:36] <plamb> an ajax call of mine was not returning results
[10:27:46] <plamb> then i added a console.log to debug
[10:27:49] <plamb> and it worked
[10:27:52] <plamb> then removed it
[10:27:55] <plamb> and it stopped working
[10:28:07] <codin_> can someone help
[10:28:08] <codin_> http://jsfiddle.net/bdpo8zsq/12/
[10:28:24] <codin_> line 12 not working in my browser
[10:28:33] <codin_> works great in JSfiddle though
[10:28:35] <duch_kazatel> what about it isn't working?
[10:28:53] <codin_> the code works in Jsfiddle but not when I putting in my localhost
[10:28:54] <plamb> any idea why one of these works and the other doesn't
[10:28:56] <plamb> http://pastebin.com/Ck074PFi
[10:29:06] <duch_kazatel> codin_ check your dev tools.
[10:29:34] <codin_> I got script from jquery
[10:29:42] <codin_> duch_kazatel
[10:29:49] <duch_kazatel> plamb both of those are identical.
[10:29:58] <duch_kazatel> codin_ okay?
[10:29:59] <plamb> i know, except the one console.log statement
[10:30:02] <codin_> duch_kazatel it works when I delete row 12
[10:30:02] <duch_kazatel> check your dev tools for an error.
[10:30:05] <plamb> which is why my mind is blown
[10:30:16] <duch_kazatel> plamb sounds like caching.
[10:30:22] <plamb> oh...
[10:30:31] <plamb> tell me more
[10:30:37] <plamb> like i need to hard refresh or something?
[10:30:41] <duch_kazatel> plamb yep.
[10:30:59] <duch_kazatel> plamb i have caching disabled when my dev tools are open.
[10:31:01] <duch_kazatel> makes like easier.
[10:31:07] <codin_> duch_kazatel when I delete Line 12 it working ---> http://jsfiddle.net/bdpo8zsq/12/
[10:31:09] <duch_kazatel> most browsers have options for that.
[10:31:16] <duch_kazatel> codin_ check your dev tools.
[10:31:19] <duch_kazatel> how else can i phrase that?
[10:31:32] <codin_> I have sublime
[10:31:57] <codin_> dush_kazatel and <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.3.js"></script> 	<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.3.min.js"></script> 	<script src="jquery.js"></script>
[10:32:18] <plamb> it was caching
[10:36:37] <HoNgOuRu> duch_kazatel, so, what do I need to detect an url change ?
[10:39:15] <codin_> duch_kazatel do I need like $(document).ready() ?
[10:42:08] <duch_kazatel> codedecay why are oyu including jquery three times?
[10:42:15] <duch_kazatel> err, codin_
[10:42:22] <duch_kazatel> HoNgOuRu popstates.
[10:42:28] <duch_kazatel> or pageloads.
[10:42:38] <duch_kazatel> depending
[10:43:01] <codin_> duch_kazatel err?
[10:43:22] <duch_kazatel> i got your screenname wrong.
[10:43:35] <codin_> ok
[10:43:55] <HoNgOuRu> duch_kazatel, ok, thanks
[10:43:56] <codin_> I need maybe a load?
[10:43:58] <duch_kazatel> either way, delete two of those - leave in <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.3.min.js"></script>
[10:44:07] <duch_kazatel> and use a more recent version.
[10:44:17] <duch_kazatel> if that still doesn't work, open your developer tools and check your console.
[10:44:42] <duch_kazatel> if that still doesn't work, share your page's code.
[10:45:22] <codin_> duch_kazatel : cannot read property play from ---> $("audio").get(0).play();
[10:45:22] <juanpablob> hello everyone! I'm trying to trigger change event onLoad but it's not working... any ideas why? here's the example: http://jsfiddle.net/jvagcur3/
[10:45:35] <duch_kazatel> codin_ there's your problem then.  fix that error.
[10:45:54] <codin_> duch_kazatel : but there is no complain in JSfiddle
[10:45:55] <duch_kazatel> juanpablob you're triggering before the listener is bound.
[10:46:06] <duch_kazatel> codin_ just telling you what i see ;)
[10:46:13] <duch_kazatel> juanpablob also, don't do $(document).find()
[10:46:17] <duch_kazatel> at least for IDs.
[10:46:39] <shoky_> also don't do .trigger('change')  ;)  just call a function
[10:46:44] <duch_kazatel> yeah that too.
[10:47:31] <juanpablob> duch_kazatel, thank you!
[10:48:12] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jvagcur3/1/
[10:51:03] <codin_> duch_kazatel How can I put out audio in another way?
[10:51:11] <duch_kazatel> codin_ that's... not the fix.
[10:51:25] <duch_kazatel> console.log() the object.
[10:51:30] <codin_> duch_kazatel : ok
[10:51:30] <duch_kazatel> make sure it's what you think it is.

[11:40:13] <blakespo1> of what was clicked
[11:40:28] <blakespo1> tnx

[12:39:32] <Bloomberg> hello guys!
[12:39:51] <Bloomberg> someone know if $.param() has a limitation of size?
[12:40:21] <duch_kazatel> probably not, but URLs can have a bit of a limitation...
[12:42:37] <adavia> whats wrong with this? https://jsfiddle.net/x0vk97xf/
[12:42:51] <adavia> sorry
[12:43:11] <duch_kazatel> that's now how you find elements.
[12:43:12] <adavia> https://jsfiddle.net/x0vk97xf/1/
[12:43:46] <duch_kazatel> yeah, that's not how you look through the DOM.
[12:44:07] <adavia> duch_kazatel: event.target.country.value works fine
[12:46:04] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/x0vk97xf/2/ adavia ;)
[12:46:25] <adavia> duch_kazatel: are you robertmaxrees?
[12:46:44] <duch_kazatel> MAAAAYBE ;)
[12:47:42] <adavia> thats an empty object
[12:47:54] <duch_kazatel> see the problem?
[12:48:33] <adavia> yes
[12:49:21] <adavia> but what would be the best solution
[12:49:36] <duch_kazatel> are you just trying to get the selected value of that select?
[12:49:52] <adavia> duch_kazatel: the id data attribute
[12:50:07] <duch_kazatel> wat
[12:50:11] <duch_kazatel> why isn't that a value?
[12:50:59] <adavia> yeah sorry
[12:51:20] <adavia> maybe $(event.target.country).data('id');
[12:51:26] <duch_kazatel> err.
[12:51:30] <duch_kazatel> so really why isn't that a value?
[12:51:33] <duch_kazatel> why a data attribute?
[12:52:00] <adavia> duch_kazatel: i already have a value
[12:52:15] <duch_kazatel> something seems really awkward here.
[12:52:52] <adavia> duch_kazatel: i need to store either name and code
[12:52:58] <adavia> i need both
[12:53:17] <duch_kazatel> but why?  why not map that elsewhere and key off the value?
[12:53:44] <Bloomberg> some idea instead of $.param()
[12:53:45] <Bloomberg> ?
[12:53:50] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg what are you trying to do?
[12:54:34] <Bloomberg> I'm passing json data to $param(), there are aprox 80 records but just get 52
[12:55:05] <duch_kazatel> malformed maybe?
[12:55:12] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg are you trying to send a lot of data to your server?
[12:55:22] <Bloomberg> no, automatically brokes in 52 records
[12:55:26] <Bloomberg> yes
[12:55:33] <duch_kazatel> don't use $.param()
[12:55:48] <duch_kazatel> serialize it or otherwise make it into json and shove that over the post body.
[12:55:54] <duch_kazatel> don't use a get in this case.
[13:13:30] <HowardwLo> hello folks! I’m having a small bug and I need help. http://jsfiddle.net/fn14La4r/  when i fill in the first field, and then click on the second field to fill it in, it alerts “this is email” both times. It should say “this is email” and then “this is name”
[13:14:27] <duch_kazatel> i'm seeing each one once.
[13:14:59] <nodist> works in firefox 40
[13:15:01] <duch_kazatel> also, fwiw, might want to use data attributes for attaching extra data.
[13:15:27] <HowardwLo> duch_kazatel: ya its not fully reproducible, but it happens. if you try it again a few times
[13:16:07] <HowardwLo> noted on the data atttributes part
[13:16:21] <duch_kazatel> oh because it's alerting the timeout and the blur.
[13:16:29] <duch_kazatel> i'm guessing.
[13:16:38] <nodist> if the values are the same it does the email thing twice
[13:17:05] <HowardwLo> nodist: values?
[13:17:32] <HowardwLo> nodist: i’ve had it happen with different values
[13:17:45] <nodist> ah ok
[13:17:53] <duch_kazatel> this looks overly complicated. what are you trying to accomplish with this?
[13:18:25] <HowardwLo> im trying to catch when they finish an input field, either after they are done typing, or after they leave the field
[13:18:53] <duch_kazatel> why not use a debounce?
[13:18:59] <HowardwLo> debounce?
[13:19:00] <duch_kazatel> just a plain ol' debounce.
[13:19:15] <duch_kazatel> there's one in underscore.
[13:21:10] <HowardwLo> ah, i’ll look into that
[13:21:19] <HowardwLo> in the mean time, any ideas on what’s up with my current code?
[13:21:25] <HowardwLo> would love to know what i did wrong..
[13:21:48] <duch_kazatel> it's really hard to follow what's going on.
[13:23:46] <duch_kazatel> something about your timeoutReference is likely broken though.
[13:24:05] <duch_kazatel> i'd crack open your debugger and follow it.
[13:25:00] <HowardwLo> alright thanks
[13:28:25] <adavia> so basically $('#country option:selected').data('id')
[13:28:51] <duch_kazatel> adavia i'd use .filter(), but yeah.
[13:29:08] <adavia> thanks
[13:31:22] <BostonGeorge2k> how can i make a div fixed to top once it reaches the top, i dont want it let scroll out
[13:32:00] <duch_kazatel> use a plugin.
[13:32:02] <duch_kazatel> !g sticky.js
[13:32:03] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Sticky Plugin → http://stickyjs.com/
[13:32:16] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you're in for a world of pain and bugs.
[13:32:35] <BostonGeorge2k> i have tried it but its a little buggy on my mobile phone
[13:32:39] <BostonGeorge2k> "it bumps back"
[13:33:02] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:33:26] <BostonGeorge2k> its not a clean "stick"
[13:33:54] <duch_kazatel> like, it starts to scroll and then sticks, depending on how fast you're going?
[13:34:15] <BostonGeorge2k> yes
[13:34:21] <BostonGeorge2k> i think
[13:34:35] <duch_kazatel> that's kind of a good thing.
[13:34:41] <duch_kazatel> any good plugin will do that.
[13:34:47] <duch_kazatel> that's the throttle at play.
[13:35:20] <BostonGeorge2k> were maybe not talking about teh same
[13:35:38] <BostonGeorge2k> once it gets sticky it bounces a little down, like it goes to far up
[13:35:48] <duch_kazatel> right.
[13:35:58] <BostonGeorge2k> thats a good thing?
[13:36:01] <duch_kazatel> could be a minor display bug.
[13:36:09] <duch_kazatel> but i'll be that's the throttle working.
[13:36:22] <Bloomberg> have the $_POST some size limit restriction?
[13:36:40] <duch_kazatel> !g php post size limit restriction
[13:36:41] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: php - What is the size limit of a post request? - Stack Overflow → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2364840/what-is-the-size-limit-of-a-post-request
[13:36:56] <BostonGeorge2k> so what can i do about it?
[13:37:07] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle - show us what you're seeing.
[13:38:07] <BostonGeorge2k> i cant reproduce it on desktop browsers
[13:38:15] <BostonGeorge2k> even in mobile mode
[13:38:15] <duch_kazatel> do you have chrome?
[13:38:18] <BostonGeorge2k> yes
[13:38:26] <duch_kazatel> so the mobile device emulation doesn't exhibit it?
[13:38:31] <BostonGeorge2k> it doesnt
[13:38:48] <duch_kazatel> so what browser is showing the bug?
[13:38:57] <BostonGeorge2k> chrome for android
[13:39:23] <duch_kazatel> that's why - you on mac or windows?
[13:39:26] <duch_kazatel> oh wait, nvm.
[13:39:27] <duch_kazatel> ignore me.
[13:39:39] <BostonGeorge2k> hm
[13:40:49] <duch_kazatel> dunno then.  maybe try different plugins.  baking your own is going to require a little more effort than is probably worth it.
[13:40:58] <BostonGeorge2k> ill install firefox on my android and check
[13:41:40] <duch_kazatel> kind of surprising device emulation in chrome doesn't break the same way for you.
[13:42:19] <BostonGeorge2k> in emulation mode i can scroll as fast as i want, once the div reaches the top it sticks
[13:42:30] <BostonGeorge2k> nicely
[13:42:31] <duch_kazatel> are you using the mouse dragscroll thinger?
[13:42:58] <BostonGeorge2k> yes
[13:43:01] <duch_kazatel> weird.
[13:48:01] <BostonGeorge2k> the play store really slows the download for firefox down :D
[14:06:48] <weaseal> hi all! does anyone know of a way to reference a variable in python Flask within jquery? Basically I want to do the same thing outlined here, but the "newOptions" list should come from the flask script that is invoking jquery: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1801499/how-to-change-options-of-select-with-jquery
[14:07:05] <duch_kazatel> huh
[14:07:05] <duch_kazatel> ?
[14:07:20] <duch_kazatel> js only knows js and DOM - flask is a backend thing.
[14:07:23] <weaseal> duch_kazatel: do you see in the stackoverflow link how they set var newOptions
[14:07:25] <duch_kazatel> need to putput html or js.
[14:07:40] <weaseal> I want to get that list from flask because it is generated based on a database call
[14:07:49] <duch_kazatel> then output JSON.
[14:07:54] <duch_kazatel> and use your JS to parse it.
[14:08:55] <weaseal> duch_kazatel: I don't think I understand - sorry, I'm a bit new to jquery, only week 2 here
[14:09:03] <weaseal> do you know of any guide that covers that?
[14:09:07] <duch_kazatel> first off, the language is javascript.
[14:09:08] <duch_kazatel> not jquery
[14:09:14] <duch_kazatel> :)
[14:09:21] <duch_kazatel> second off, output json - that's what you want.
[14:09:33] <duch_kazatel> basically, javascript and python don't talk to each other.
[14:09:52] <weaseal> so flask should print the full array and filter it with jquery, somehow
[14:10:00] <duch_kazatel> *javascript.
[14:10:03] <duch_kazatel> you need to have your python output data in a format javascript understands.
[14:10:12] <duch_kazatel> usually, that's done with JSON.
[14:10:28] <weaseal> ok, I think I get it at a higher level, I'll go play with jsfiddler
[14:10:29] <duch_kazatel> so look for a way to have flask/python output json into the page into a script tag.
[14:11:09] <weaseal> duch_kazatel: can one <script> tag reference elements from a separate <script> tag in the same page?
[14:11:21] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[14:11:28] <weaseal> alright thanks
[14:11:31] <duch_kazatel> as long as you don't put your data inside a function.
[14:11:35] <BostonGeorge2k> * same problem in firefox for android btw
[14:11:39] <BostonGeorge2k> i will report to the dev
[14:11:52] <duch_kazatel> BostonGeorge2k make sure you make a fiddle or something to reproduce.
[14:12:00] <BostonGeorge2k> yes
[14:15:54] <doctorly> does promise() work if I attach it to the parent of the div that is performing animations?

[15:20:56] <ahandy> hi guys, quick question. i have a container with a scrollbar inside, and then some arrows on the right/left. When the user clicks the arrow it will start scrolling until he stops his click. However, I don't know how to make it continue scrolling smoothly until he stops. What i have now is an interval with & animate scrollLeft inside,  what's another way?
[15:21:55] <ahandy> With animate it scrolls then stops for 0.1s then starts scrolling again etc etc
[15:22:08] <duch_kazatel> mousedown and mouseup.
[15:22:14] <duch_kazatel> oh that part.
[15:22:24] <duch_kazatel> why not just use the default scrollbar functionality?
[15:23:12] <ahandy> Have to follow the designer's design, and in that design there's no scrollbar showing
[15:23:17] <ahandy> Solely relying on the arrows
[15:23:20] <ahandy> So need to find a way
[15:23:30] <ahandy> Without the use of any plugin because there are so many things built in that container
[15:23:34] <ahandy> that adding a plugin will mess it all up
[15:23:38] <duch_kazatel> wut
[15:23:47] <duch_kazatel> then make a basic fiddle.
[15:25:17] <ahandy> on it
[15:27:29] <ULTafk> hi duch_kazatel, I tried to make your example working with my live shop. I think this should be working, but it is not.. :$

[15:27:39] <ULTafk> Can you take a quick look? http://jsfiddle.net/ultimatia/8222jm8x/2/
[15:27:56] <ULTafk> it is alot html code unfurtunaly
[15:28:33] <duch_kazatel> uh
[15:28:39] <duch_kazatel>  onclick="$(this).parent().change();"
[15:28:40] <duch_kazatel> no
[15:29:56] <Zzaichik> onclick="aww yeah"
[15:30:05] <duch_kazatel> don't use onclick.

[15:30:20] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8222jm8x/3/

[15:33:23] <duch_kazatel> abailarri there isn't one - var myDate = new Date(); then read all the data off as appropriate.
[15:33:41] <duch_kazatel> brb emergency
[15:33:56] <abailarri> duch_kazatel,   var myDate = new Date(Wed Sep 23 2015 00:26:06 GMT+0200 (CEST))?
[15:34:04] <duch_kazatel> no.
[15:34:06] <duch_kazatel> !g mdn date
[15:34:06] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Date - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[15:34:11] <duch_kazatel> abailarri read the docs
[15:36:02] <ahandy> duch_kazatel: any answer for me :(?
[15:36:06] <duch_kazatel> looking.
[15:36:13] <duch_kazatel> you basically want recursive setTimeout call.
[15:36:25] <duch_kazatel> if you're stuck on animations, you basically need an easing.
[15:36:31] <duch_kazatel> your designers are jerks ;)
[15:36:32] <ULTafk> duch_kazatel thx. This line: $('.tb_checked').on('change', function () { is not working cause of that class is added on the select AND on the td?
[15:36:42] <duch_kazatel> ULTafk sort of, yeah.
[15:36:45] <duch_kazatel> and you were using onchange.
[15:36:48] <duch_kazatel> never use onchange.
[15:37:29] <ULTafk> but we still use that, also on your 2nd example.
[15:37:41] <duch_kazatel> delete it.
[15:37:52] <duch_kazatel> don't use them.
[15:37:54] <ULTafk> what is wrong with onchange?
[15:37:55] <ULTafk> :p
[15:38:22] <ULTafk> we need .change() instead?
[15:38:26] <duch_kazatel> you have .on() in jquery.
[15:38:41] <duch_kazatel> onchange is a hack - your html is great at being html.  don't put logic in it.
[15:38:56] <ULTafk> aah right. true. you mean in the html code.
[15:39:03] <duch_kazatel> right.
[15:39:03] <ULTafk> that part of jquery
[15:39:31] <duch_kazatel> and javascript in general.
[15:39:52] <ULTafk> you mean this: onclick="$(this).parent().change();"
[15:39:57] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[15:39:59] <duch_kazatel> don't use those.
[15:40:01] <duch_kazatel> use javascript.
[15:40:15] <ULTafk> do you have a clue why it is there?
[15:40:20] <ULTafk> it is in the opencart code
[15:40:25] <duch_kazatel> oh...
[15:40:37] <duch_kazatel> that's apart of its code?  that's something custom then...
[15:40:42] <duch_kazatel> but that would be part of your problem.
[15:40:55] <ULTafk> alright. thanks!
[15:41:31] <ULTafk> than we have now only a little problem. But i will first take a look by myself.
[15:41:53] <ULTafk> when we load the page, options are preselected.
[15:42:12] <ULTafk> and we need your script running on page load, and than on change
[15:42:12] <duch_kazatel> abstract out your logic.  you'll figure it out.
[15:43:13] <ahandy> duch_kazatel: basically add a 'linear' easing to the animation?
[15:43:20] <ahandy> duch_kazatel: whats the diff between a recursive set timeout & a setinterval?
[15:43:24] <duch_kazatel> ahandy sure, but i'm not sure why you're using animations.
[15:43:38] <ahandy> duch_kazatel: how would u go about it
[15:43:42] <ahandy> duch_kazatel: if no animations
[15:43:44] <duch_kazatel> i'm making a basic version to show you.
[15:44:03] <duch_kazatel> gimme a few more.
[15:44:39] <ahandy> thanks dude

[15:47:56] <duch_kazatel> basic idea.
[15:48:55] <ahandy> duch_kazatel: awesome, thanks
[15:49:24] <sanko> i get an "SyntaxError: missing } after property list" > http://pastebin.com/1nuaq7iF

[15:50:05] <duch_kazatel> you sure that's what you want?
[15:50:27] <sanko> whats wrong there?
[15:51:21] <duch_kazatel> just checking.
[15:51:26] <duch_kazatel> no need for the surrounding parens.
[15:51:51] <duch_kazatel> and that semicolon should look suspect ;)
[15:52:13] <duch_kazatel> that line should just be scrollTop: target_element.offset().top
[15:52:14] <sanko> ah ye
[15:52:27] <duch_kazatel> also, what's with the returns?
[15:52:52] <sanko> :) i am new to this

[15:55:54] <sanko> :( i want to code like that
[15:56:01] <duch_kazatel> if and for don't have scope so any var declaration isn't valid there.
[15:56:08] <duch_kazatel> just gotta memorize things.
[15:56:11] <sanko> k

[16:17:02] <duch_kazatel> sillyslux not with the var keyword.
[16:19:38] <ssssMd> hi i have a proble... jquery doesnt calculate correctly when i use .width() method
[16:19:42] <ssssMd> what can i do to fix that?
[16:19:55] <duch_kazatel> try outerWidth()
[16:22:27] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, clarify what's wrong with it.
[16:25:37] <ssssMd> i need the width without margins
[16:26:05] <ssssMd> the idea is that the width is different that the one that the browser shows me
[16:29:05] <ssssMd> duch_kazatel: i can send you a link if you have a moment
[16:29:13] <duch_kazatel> just make a fiddle or something.
[16:29:15] <duch_kazatel> no pms pls.
[16:29:30] <ssssMd> http://dbdtransitions.co.uk/work/
[16:29:53] <ssssMd> the first line in console is
[16:30:19] <ssssMd> $('#scrolldiv').width();
[16:30:54] <duch_kazatel> that's not a fiddle.
[16:31:01] <ssssMd> yea it's the actual site
[16:31:09] <duch_kazatel> cool - could you maybe make a fiddle instead?
[16:31:19] <duch_kazatel> that way i can easier see your code and edit it.
[16:31:41] <ssssMd> ok
[16:35:14] <duch_kazatel> ssssMd http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2puhnkeh/1/
[16:35:15] <duch_kazatel> here
[16:35:17] <ssssMd> http://jsfiddle.net/46bLbdez/
[16:35:21] <duch_kazatel> the 4 different widthgs
[16:35:35] <ssssMd> i know
[16:35:50] <ssssMd> the code is correct
[16:35:55] <duch_kazatel> wat
[16:36:41] <duch_kazatel> also: $('.testli').width(asdff);
[16:36:41] <ssssMd> i need width without margins so i tried width and innerWidth. they both returned the same value, but it is different than the actual div size without margin
[16:36:43] <duch_kazatel> can just do that.
[16:36:54] <duch_kazatel> you want the outerwidth
[16:37:36] <duch_kazatel> could you clarify what's wrong about this?
[16:40:12] <ssssMd> my div's dimension is 1113 if i measure it with chrome
[16:40:37] <ssssMd> and jquery gives me 1099
[16:42:10] <ssssMd> so .width or .outerWidth or .innerWidth gives me a wrong value
[16:43:32] <duch_kazatel> what about outerWidth(true)
[16:44:37] <duch_kazatel> and what do you want this to end up looking like?
[16:44:41] <ssssMd> i can't use that
[16:44:42] <duch_kazatel> which is ultimately more important.
[16:45:33] <duch_kazatel> so going back to your fiddle - what's the actual visual problem with it?
[16:46:06] <ssssMd> ok so i have a responsive div with a list in it. i need to manually set the width of the <li> = the width of the div
[16:46:24] <ssssMd> and the li ends up bigger than the div
[16:47:18] <duch_kazatel> you know the UL has like 40px of margin on it, right?
[16:47:29] <duch_kazatel> and you should be using css for this anyway.
[16:47:58] <duch_kazatel> like - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/46bLbdez/1/
[16:49:28] <ssssMd> so i used bootstrap and the main div has "col-xs-offset-1"
[16:50:03] <duch_kazatel> so you have a bootstrap question then?
[16:50:13] <ssssMd> no
[16:50:31] <ssssMd> also
[16:51:08] <ssssMd> my biggest problem is that i get different values
[16:51:12] <ssssMd> in different browsers
[16:51:41] <duch_kazatel> so jquery calculates things differently.  if you feel you have an actual bug with jquery, feel free to report it :) otherwise, this is really a case where you should be using CSS.
[16:51:43] <duch_kazatel> not javascript.
[16:52:14] <ssssMd> i can't use css
[16:52:20] <duch_kazatel> why not?
[16:52:57] <ssssMd> i need to manually set the size in px
[16:53:00] <ssssMd> for a plugin to work
[16:53:10] <duch_kazatel> welp/.
[16:53:23] <duch_kazatel> dunno then, sorry!
[16:53:37] <ssssMd> ok np
[16:53:41] <ssssMd> i'll try another plugin :d
[16:53:47] <ssssMd> one more question
[16:53:51] <duch_kazatel> what's the plugin doing?
[16:54:14] <ssssMd> horizontal text scrolling
[16:55:29] <ssssMd> so i have 2 main divs in my website. top and content. i set manually the height of the content to be window.height- top.height. it works fine on chrome, but on mozilla it ends up bigger the window.height

[17:03:25] <duch_kazatel> err, popstates
[17:03:42] <HoNgOuRu> onload works the first time
[17:03:46] <duch_kazatel> right.
[17:03:53] <HoNgOuRu> not if it keeps playing videos from a list
[17:03:57] <HoNgOuRu> or user clicks
[17:04:27] <duch_kazatel> window.onpopstate = function() { console.log('sicktight') }
[17:04:43] <HoNgOuRu> let me see
[17:04:58] <duch_kazatel> if that doesn't work, see if you can find a chome extension channel.
[17:05:48] <HoNgOuRu> nope.. didn't work either
[17:05:53] <duch_kazatel> dunno then!
[17:05:56] <HoNgOuRu> ok, thanks

[17:16:25] <duch_kazatel> depending on where and why, that's what you want.
[17:16:33] <BostonGeorge2k> that caused the error
[17:16:46] <duch_kazatel> what error?
[17:16:52] <BostonGeorge2k> i posted earlier
[17:16:58] <duch_kazatel> you posted like 5 today ;)
[17:17:03] <BostonGeorge2k> XML Req
[17:17:07] <duch_kazatel> fwiw normally you put your js either in the head or right before </body>?
[17:17:13] <duch_kazatel> err, </body>
[17:17:55] <BostonGeorge2k> yes normally.. i had a separater .php which i would include on some pages, that one needed some custom js so i put it inside the file
[17:18:04] <BostonGeorge2k> because i thought i dont need to load it for all other files
[17:18:12] <BostonGeorge2k> well turned out to be a bad idea
[17:18:20] <BostonGeorge2k> at least the way i did it
[17:18:27] <duch_kazatel> depending on how you're using jqm and some other things, that's not the right way to do that.
[17:39:20] <acidjazz> lets say i have something like One.two.three();, but "three" comes from an array, how can i specify that? One.two[array[2]()]; ?
[17:39:47] <duch_kazatel> one.two[2]()
[17:41:03] <duch_kazatel> var myObject = {

[17:51:56] <BostonGeorge2k> oops that code is supposed to go there
[17:52:02] <BostonGeorge2k> and 2. by clicking the "home" link

[17:52:37] <duch_kazatel> sooo what's the issue?

[17:54:20] <BostonGeorge2k> i cant rebuild everything as a fiddle
[17:54:42] <duch_kazatel> dunno!  but you keep asking questions that kind of require your code or a functioning example of some kind.
[17:54:58] <duch_kazatel> i don't really know what you're expecting us to do otherwise.
[17:55:07] <duch_kazatel> as a last-ditch: is the site live?
[17:57:10] <BostonGeorge2k> half-way
[17:57:32] <duch_kazatel> if we can see an example with the broken code, we can start there i guess.
[18:03:15] <BostonGeorge2k> ok i figured out is has something to do with that class: one-page-menu
[18:03:23] <BostonGeorge2k> will scroll the .js now for it
[18:03:29] <duch_kazatel> ...
[18:03:36] <duch_kazatel> so it sounds like you haven't really read the docs.
[18:04:10] <duch_kazatel> the issue is that jquery mobile tries to load things via ajax depending on how you have things setup.  it sounds like maybe you've got some code somewhere that's messing with the default ajax settings.
[18:06:10] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28322636/synchronous-xmlhttprequest-warning-and-script
[18:06:26] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you have a script tag within the page body - that's not what you want.
[18:07:13] <BostonGeorge2k> thanks, i stumbled already over that page and i have fixed that
[18:07:32] <BostonGeorge2k> probably more then one issue, you are right about the default ajax behavior i guess
[18:07:44] <BostonGeorge2k> but i think i have a fix :)
[18:07:49] <duch_kazatel> right, so until you can show us your code, we can't really help.
[18:07:55] <BostonGeorge2k> i understand
[18:07:57] <duch_kazatel> because it can be due to al;l sorts of other issues.  make sense?

[22:16:45] <Uhkis> file..?
[22:17:07] <PickAndMix> Uhkis: The array object i mean
[22:17:59] <Uhkis> didn't you already do that? :)
[22:19:09] <PickAndMix> Uhkis: This was a script done for me earlier by my friend. His not available now.
[22:19:36] <PickAndMix> Uhkis: I tried saving the JS into a file, and link to it into my HTML file, but I have no idea how to grab the list from there.
[22:20:14] <Uhkis> just copy and paste?
[22:20:55] <PickAndMix> I copied and paste this line <ul id="shops"></ul>
[22:20:57] <PickAndMix> It didn't; work
[22:21:21] <Uhkis> copy the code..?
[22:21:25] <Uhkis> what do you have now?
[22:22:14] <PickAndMix> http://jsfiddle.net/hsncat3b/
[22:22:23] <PickAndMix> This is my html code, looks wierd without the css and image elements.
[22:22:55] <PickAndMix> I'm trying to paste it in line 62
[22:24:31] <Uhkis> paste it to an external js-file and link it
[22:24:43] <Uhkis> <script src="yourfile.js"></script>
[22:25:13] <PickAndMix> I did
[22:25:16] <PickAndMix> store.js
[22:26:04] <Uhkis> oh, you're not including jquery in that
[22:26:17] <Uhkis> you need jquery before any other jquery using scripts
[22:26:28] <PickAndMix> Ohh....
[22:28:09] <PickAndMix> I did that, and nothing happened still though
[22:30:41] <Uhkis> do you have a live site of this?
[22:30:49] <lenswipee> hi, any idea how to mix FormData with other data in the ajax call? see my sample here: https://jsfiddle.net/j0v6p3nh/
[22:30:51] <PickAndMix> No.. I could send you the live code though..
[22:31:20] <Uhkis> PickAndMix: then update the fiddle with the newest html
[22:32:45] <PickAndMix> http://jsfiddle.net/hsncat3b/1/
[22:32:58] <PickAndMix> Wow, it seems to work in the jsfiddle, but it's not working on my google chrome preview though.
[22:33:46] <Uhkis> PickAndMix: jquery _BEFORE_ others
[22:34:25] <PickAndMix> done! But still ain't working
[22:34:27] <PickAndMix> lol..
[22:43:27] <PickAndMix> Uhkis: do you have any idea?
[22:44:57] <Uhkis> PickAndMix: hard to tell without the actual site (if you fixed the script order)
[22:45:20] <PickAndMix> Uhkis: How can I solve this? on my own.
[22:45:30] <PickAndMix> Uhkis: It's so weird.
[22:45:58] <guessx> you can defer the js
[22:46:12] <Uhkis> check for 404's?
[22:46:32] <PickAndMix> defer js?
[22:46:33] <PickAndMix> 404's?
[22:46:37] <guessx> http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_script_defer.asp
[22:47:11] <Uhkis> http://www.w3fools.com/
[22:47:52] <guessx> yea i know, it was the first one that popped up that gives roughly the same summary of usage
[22:49:23] <Uhkis> PickAndMix: 404 is a http status code for "not found". make sure your browser actually finds the store.js script
[23:14:54] <lenswipee> hi, any idea how to mix FormData with other data in the ajax call? see my sample here: https://jsfiddle.net/j0v6p3nh/
[23:15:30] <Uhkis> ?mdn formdata
[23:15:31] <b-ot> Uhkis: FormData - Web API Interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[23:15:33] <tash> is it possible to make some text clickable? No thinking a hyperlink, unless that will accomplish what I want.  <div class="titlebox" id="content-title-container">Notes</div> I'd like the word Notes to be clickable and I'd like it to hide/show something when clicked.  A hyperlink won't work will it?
[23:16:03] <Cork> lenswipee: just append the key, value to the object
[23:16:27] <Uhkis> tash: $('#content-title-container').on('click', function() { code here });
[23:16:39] <tash> oh dear lord
[23:16:43] <tash> I should have known that!
[23:16:45] <tash> ugh
[23:17:03] <tash> how annoying...thanks
[23:18:17] <lenswipee> Cork: huh?
[23:18:33] <Cork> lenswipee: form_data.append('key', 'value')
[23:18:59] <Cork> note you can't get the value back out of the formData object again though
[23:19:11] <Cork> so if you need it else where keep a separate copy of it
[23:19:46] <Uhkis> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/get ?
[23:20:19] <Uhkis> oh, not very supported
[23:20:44] <Cork> Uhkis: and also very new in the one browser supporting it :)
[23:20:55] <Cork> 39 is 12 weeks old
[23:21:41] <Uhkis> so i'd say lenswipee would be better off using serializeArray
[23:21:55] <Cork> except you can't use that for file uploads
[23:22:17] <lenswipee> help :( i'm slowly dying. trying to ajax a file uploader.
[23:22:18] <Uhkis> typical
[23:22:45] <lenswipee> i got the php file uploader working, but now trying to ajax it. need some help guys
[23:22:53] <Cork> lenswipee: formData is quite straight forward
[23:23:11] <Cork> you basically already have it there
[23:23:20] <Cork> just append the data you want to append and you're done
[23:23:32] <lenswipee> basically how to get $_FILES available to server from client
[23:23:46] <tash> Uhkis: http://pastebin.com/icA7trqF How can I .show() that which was hidden when I click on that div again? Will I have to give the div some property when it is hidden, then if that property exists on click, then show?
[23:23:49] <Cork> by appending the file to the formData object
[23:23:59] <Uhkis> tash: jsfiddle.net
[23:24:03] <lenswipee> given that FormData is not well supported, i'm scrapping it.
[23:24:17] <Cork> lenswipee: fileData is quite well supported
[23:24:25] <Cork> just not the extra features
[23:24:50] <lenswipee> Cork: ok, so how i use that bro?
[23:25:01] <lenswipee> see my sample here: https://jsfiddle.net/j0v6p3nh/
[23:25:33] <Cork> lenswipee: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/Using_FormData_Objects
[23:25:51] <Cork> like i said, append the file you want to submit
[23:26:17] <lenswipee> Cork: FormData is not well supported it says
[23:27:25] <lenswipee> Cork: and there is no fileData
[23:27:42] <Cork> ugg typo
[23:27:53] <Cork> lenswipee: it is supported cross browsers
[23:28:02] <Cork> yes you need fairly new browsers (ie10)
[23:28:22] <lenswipee> Cork: Uhkis says it's not, and it says its not.
[23:28:26] <Cork> but the only option if you don't want to use formdata is flash, silverlight, java, or iframes
[23:28:40] <Cork> lenswipee: sigh... no it says it is
[23:28:53] <Cork> heck i use it my self i know exactly how well it is supported
[23:29:08] <tash> Uhkis: ugh, I can't seem to get the fiddle to do the primary function we are talking about
[23:29:24] <Cork> lenswipee: but yes, if you need old ie support you will have to look for browser plugins for the upload
[23:29:29] <Cork> lenswipee: flash is a common choice
[23:29:34] <Uhkis> tash: link?
[23:29:53] <tash> http://jsfiddle.net/gd6yoh3x/
[23:30:00] <lenswipee> Cork: IE10+
[23:30:07] <Cork> personally i'm perfectly fine with showing a banner "update your browser if you want to upload files"
[23:30:13] <lenswipee> Cork: IE9 isn't old :(
[23:30:17] <Cork> lenswipee: it is
[23:30:44] <Cork> lenswipee: ie9 is 4 years old
[23:30:59] <Uhkis> tash: http://jsfiddle.net/gd6yoh3x/1/
[23:31:02] <lenswipee> Cork: China runs on IE7
[23:31:08] <Cork> nice for them
[23:31:24] <lenswipee> Cork: and they make it 80% of my market.
[23:31:33] <tash> Uhkis: brilliant
[23:31:35] <Cork> lenswipee: firefox 3.6 was released at the same age as ie9
[23:31:37] <tash> I didn't know about toggle
[23:31:37] <tash> thanks
[23:31:54] <Cork> that is 41 releases ago
[23:32:09] <Cork> so yes ie9 is old, ie7 is broken
[23:32:19] <Uhkis> and if firefox had sane release numbering, it would be 2 releases ago :D
[23:32:39] <Cork> Uhkis: well it would be 4 versions, but ya
[23:32:50] <Cork> they had one major version per year before
[23:33:01] <beasty> morning Cork o/
[23:33:03] <Cork> o/
[23:33:30] <Cork> lenswipee: but like i said, if you need old browser support you will have to use a plugin
[23:33:43] <Cork> lenswipee: actually there is one other option
[23:34:02] <Cork> lenswipee: use formdata for browsers that support it, and fall back to pure http posts for the ones that doesn't
[23:34:15] <Cork> meaning no ajax for old browsers
[23:34:20] <lenswipee> Cork: how you do that?
[23:35:11] <lenswipee> Cork: is there a simple line of code that checks if formData is supported on browser?
[23:35:25] <lenswipee> Cork: rather than checking each browser
[23:35:26] <Cork> lenswipee: if(window.FormData) { $('form').on('submit', func) }
[23:35:53] <Cork> or if you prefer to be explicit
[23:36:02] <Cork> lenswipee: if(window.FormData != undefined) { $('form').on('submit', func) }
[23:36:27] <lenswipee> Cork: i'm explicit kind of guy. thanks
[23:38:01] <lenswipee> Cork: about my original problem. I can add the formdata but didn't know how to mix it with other post data.
[23:38:26] <Cork> for heavens sake... read the response...
[23:38:34] <Cork> i won't answer that question a forth time...
[23:40:57] <lenswipee> Cork: did you look at my jsfiddle?
[23:41:04] <Cork> sigh yes
[23:50:24] <lenswipee> how i add formData with jquery if i have other data, so: data: form_data, { action : 'foo', security : 'bar }, <-- doesn't work
[23:50:34] <Cork> sigh
[23:50:43] <Cork> ok, ignore the answer
[23:51:09] <lenswipee> what?
[23:51:30] <Uhkis> *all the answers ;-D
[23:52:35] <lenswipee> i'll keep googling.
[23:52:39] <lenswipee> laters
[23:52:43] <lenswipee> :D
[23:53:03] <Uhkis> why would you google when you could just scroll up a few lines?
[23:54:44] <arc_> this looks like one of those horror stories of IT that you see on imgur but you don't really believe it could be true
[23:58:04] <lenswipee> <Uhkis> oh, not very supported. <Uhkis> so i'd say lenswipee would be better off using serializeArray
[23:58:13] <lenswipee> you mean this?
[23:58:50] <Uhkis> [09:18] < Cork> lenswipee: form_data.append('key', 'value')
[23:59:26] <arc_> i thought we arrived at the conclusion that this method is not supported prior to ie10 and he needs ie7-9 support so he should find another non-jquery solution such as flash or silverlight
[23:59:27] <lenswipee> Uhkis: scrap that. it's not well supported you said. i agree.
[23:59:56] <Uhkis> so we're back on this road..
