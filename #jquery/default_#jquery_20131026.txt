[00:00:46] <rmah> this draggable works in chrome/ff but not in IE => http://jsfiddle.net/teb4u/1/
[00:06:25] <rmah> fucking IE
[00:26:43] <OfficeDepot0894> I have  a jqm question
[00:29:36] <OfficeDepot0894> um.. I have a multipage document, and would like to use panels, however the panels use ids such as #left-panel and #right-panel. Is there a way to use these two panels for ALL pages within my app, or must I name each page's panel ids to something unique??
[00:29:53] <CodesStuff> use classes
[00:29:58] <CodesStuff> then id's
[00:30:34] <CodesStuff> so .panel-left and .panel-right, then do like #page1leftpanel and #page1rightpanel or something
[00:31:11] <OfficeDepot0894> so there isn't a way to avoid unique ids on all panels
[00:32:14] <CodesStuff> Erm
[00:32:21] <CodesStuff> use a base class
[00:32:33] <CodesStuff> then just style stuff within it using a complicated selector?
[00:32:56] <OfficeDepot0894> var page = $('div[data-role="page"]); var leftPanel = $(page).find('#left-panel");
[00:33:28] <OfficeDepot0894> works however it acts on every panel.
[00:33:30] <OfficeDepot0894> yeah
[00:35:51] <CodesStuff> hmm
[00:35:56] <CodesStuff> so you only want to use it on ONE of them?
[00:36:16] <OfficeDepot0894> no, I want panels on all 11 pages
[00:36:44] <OfficeDepot0894> but I don't want to write jquery code for each and every page
[00:37:41] <CodesStuff> erm, you could use a ghetto method and include the script in <script src="../blah.js"></script>
[00:38:12] <CodesStuff> then check if(document.location.search("uri") >-1){..do stuff }else{ ..do other stuff}
[00:38:38] <OfficeDepot0894> hmm, I think the issue here is that you can't use the same id twice, even though they are on separate jqm "pages"
[00:39:35] <CodesStuff> So change the ID's and use classes
[00:39:43] <CodesStuff> or html5 data-* attributes if you need to
[00:40:08] <OfficeDepot0894> yeah I'm soooo lazy though :)
[00:40:19] <CodesStuff> idk what to tell you then. lol
[00:40:23] <CodesStuff> ctrl + h works well
[00:40:36] <CodesStuff> find and replace gets the job done if the code is pretty static across multiple pages
[00:40:57] <rmah> http://jsfiddle.net/teb4u/3/
[00:41:23] <rmah> the only way to make that work on IE is to stick a 100% sized invisible image in the #drag div
[00:41:32] <rmah> does anyone know of a cleaner way?
[00:42:05] <rmah> oh, or add a background color to the #drag div.  but I need to be able to see through it
[00:43:05] <CodesStuff> Erm, doesn't IE have that opacity filter?
[00:43:16] <CodesStuff> Also, it's weird seeing you outside of #startups
[00:43:54] <CodesStuff> Oh, and your HTML is broken.
[00:47:32] <rmah> dammit, jsfiddle is flaky in IE
[00:47:46] <rmah> http://jsfiddle.net/teb4u/4/
[00:48:10] <rmah> CodesStuff: see what I mean though?  you can drag and resize the box fine in chrome/ff/safari
[00:48:14] <rmah> but not in IE :-(
[00:48:47] <rmah> this occurs whenever there's an image behind it
[00:48:58] <rmah> no image and it works fine in IE
[00:49:01] <rmah> god, I hate IE
[00:49:03] <OfficeDepot0894> ok, another panel question.  Why does the panel auto-close when you click outside of it?
[00:49:23] <CodesStuff> rmah: I got that bit fixed, but now when I hover over it, it doesn't let me drag it
[00:49:27] <CodesStuff> Just resize.
[00:49:42] <rmah> CodesStuff: yeah, it drags if you click on the *border* in IE
[00:49:53] <rmah> click very carefully :-)
[00:49:58] <rmah> my real box is a proxy with no border
[00:50:07] <rmah> just added it to so I could see it
[00:50:35] <CodesStuff> rmah: http://jsfiddle.net/teb4u/5/
[00:50:40] <CodesStuff> Try that out.
[00:51:22] <rmah> haha, what the hell?
[00:51:44] <CodesStuff> Was that not what you were looking for?
[00:52:29] <CodesStuff> You said you needed to be able to see through the div and apply a background color, otherwise you'd need to set a transparent background image.
[00:52:36] <rmah> the behavior with the resizable is not strange for you?
[00:52:47] <CodesStuff> Yeah, thats what I was talking about before
[00:52:55] <CodesStuff> I think it's because of the inner div
[00:53:04] <CodesStuff> Maybe if I change it to a span or img tag..
[00:53:30] <rmah> well, as I said, I got it to work by sticking a transparent gif in there at 100% size
[00:53:40] <rmah> but it seems like such a hack
[00:53:52] <rmah> I was wondering if there was a more elegant way or if I was just missing something
[00:54:10] <CodesStuff> wait
[00:54:15] <CodesStuff> herp derp. I can z-index the thing
[00:54:16] <CodesStuff> sec
[00:54:41] <CodesStuff> rmah: http://jsfiddle.net/teb4u/6/
[00:54:43] <CodesStuff> There. Perfect
[00:54:44] <rmah> oh, I see what the problem is
[00:54:58] <CodesStuff> yeah, the inner div was getting the focus
[00:55:02] <rmah> the #drag > div affects the resize handles, which are implemented as div's inside the #drag
[00:55:05] <CodesStuff> ^Yep
[00:55:47] <rmah> hmm, interesting
[00:56:08] <CodesStuff> Works well on my end
[00:56:11] <rmah> here too
[00:56:20] <rmah> thanks for your time, man
[00:56:22] <CodesStuff> sweet. Now I can close iexplore.exe
[00:56:23] <CodesStuff> np
[00:56:25] <rmah> damn, it's late
[00:56:28] <rmah> (or early)
[00:56:49] <CodesStuff> I just woke up. Probably gonna go for a jog once the sun is up. Too cold here.
[00:56:50] <rmah> you don't happen to know anything about jquery.knob, do you?
[00:56:58] <CodesStuff> Nah. I don't really use plugins
[00:57:23] <CodesStuff> Oh that's nifty
[00:57:38] <rmah> it doesn't work on < IE8
[00:57:40] <rmah> :-(
[00:57:44] <CodesStuff> Yeah, cuz canvas
[00:57:51] <CodesStuff> You could probably make an svg hack for it, no?
[00:58:01] <rmah> haha
[00:58:12] <rmah> I was sorta hoping someone else had done the work
[00:58:27] <rmah> so how's maine treating you?
[00:58:36] <rmah> cold yet?
[00:58:47] <CodesStuff> Getting there. It's probably in the high 30's right now
[00:58:56] <CodesStuff> Oh shit. 31F
[00:59:28] <CodesStuff> I'ma head down to Florida for a week or so in November. Getting itchy feet.
[01:00:44] <rmah> you pansie!
[01:00:57] <rmah> I thought you northern types loved the cold :-)
[01:02:12] <CodesStuff> I like the cold, however I'm not done with summer.
[01:12:11] <jl2753> Hi guys, I'm trying to make the color of a box change color and size when clicked on, but not sure why it's not working.... could anyone point me in the right direction? http://jsfiddle.net/ySKcJ/
[01:22:14] <jl2753> hey, could anyone help out real quick? I'm sure it's something trivial but I can't for the life of me figure out why this isn't working: http://jsfiddle.net/ySKcJ/
[01:23:13] <joroci> jl2753
[01:23:22] <CodesStuff> What's the issue?
[01:23:24] <joroci> what's the point of checking for the id
[01:23:29] <CodesStuff> oh, background-color***
[01:23:37] <jl2753> Yeah I wanted to change the background color
[01:23:47] <jl2753> Yeah I wanted to change the background color and size
[01:24:10] <joroci> but why add the event to body
[01:24:18] <joroci> and then check if it's the element?
[01:25:28] <jl2753> I'm not sure, I'm just trying to learn from examples- I was trying onClick, keyPress, but couldn't get any of them to work
[01:25:29] <CodesStuff> jl2753: you neglected to load jquery on the left
[01:25:34] <CodesStuff> http://jsfiddle.net/ySKcJ/1/
[01:25:35] <CodesStuff> and you had some useless stuff
[01:25:35] <jl2753> OH
[01:25:38] <jl2753> yes, you're right
[01:26:09] <CodesStuff> also, for the "height" property in .animate() you neglected to wrap the 640px string in quotes
[01:26:13] <CodesStuff> which caused an error
[01:26:31] <CodesStuff> you also referenced "background" instead of "background-color" in the .css() function
[01:27:28] <jl2753> CodeStuff: Thank you! Not loading jquery was a dumb mistake, thank you for the note on the syntax error for the height
[01:28:13] <CodesStuff> np
[02:12:15] <raj> how about an Add Tab example? http://jqueryui.com/tabs/

[07:23:39] <paulens> ah..

[07:57:06] <AntelopeSalad> i'm using the popular jquery validation plugin and i'm curious, how do you customize the remote validation when calling it via data-attribs?
[07:57:54] <AntelopeSalad> it seems you can do: "data-rule-remote" and pass it the end point to validate against but i want to send a post request rather than get and i'm not sure how to do that while still only using data attribs
[08:01:28] <frank_o> Anybody know why jQuery won't run on Android 2.3.5 (HuaweiU8800Pro)? http://jsbin.com/EdUfyio/1/ produces: Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[08:01:31] <frank_o> On other Android devices (from 2.2 through to 4.2 at http://browserstack.com/) it seems to run just fine.
[08:22:04] <zandman_26> cant understand why the submit does not get called on this code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7170606
[08:36:18] <someotherguy> el.parents() gives me object with jquery objects in it. How can i iterate this object to get those jquery objects? Doing for(var parent in parents) will end up giving me html not jquery objects
[08:36:27] <someotherguy> same result with Object.keys().forEach
[08:39:44] <someotherguy> using .each will do it, nvm
[08:41:46] <someotherguy> or not...
[08:41:48] <someotherguy> i don't get it
[08:53:20] <Vendethiel1> someotherguy: for (var parent in parents) $(parent) ?
[08:54:13] <someotherguy> yeah, i just figure the $(parent) thing. Why is it necessary though, it seems strange to me
[08:54:34] <someotherguy> when i log out the parents object i see jquery objects there, when i start iterating they somehow "turn" into html objects
[08:55:13] <rmah> someotherguy: all jquery objects are arrays of DOM objects
[08:55:28] <rmah> (I think)
[08:56:09] <someotherguy> i mean, if i do, console.log($('.foo').parents()); i get an object with 0-n keys. each of which are jquery object having all the params and functions
[08:56:46] <rmah> are they?  odd
[08:56:52] <someotherguy> but when i'm starting to iterate, they magically turn into html dom objects without jquery functions
[08:56:57] <someotherguy> and i need to make a $(el) cast
[08:57:00] <someotherguy> to get jquery stuff
[08:57:18] <rmah> well, it is what it is
[08:57:32] <someotherguy> i'd just like to know why it is like that : )
[09:18:35] <PrinceOfNigeria> Does anyone know if jQuery's promise implementation still doesn't adhere to the Promises/A+ spec?
[09:19:49] <grafi> phew, no idea
[09:21:10] <PrinceOfNigeria> The Promises website used to have a list of the ones that adhered but the page is 404'd now :(
[09:21:44] <grafi> http://promises-aplus.github.io/promises-spec/ that one?
[09:24:19] <PrinceOfNigeria> Yup. At the bottom they had a link to the implementations with all of the ones that adhered. http://promises-aplus.github.io/implementations
[09:24:32] <PrinceOfNigeria> It is okay though. Gonna give Q a shot. Thanks anyways
[09:24:56] <grafi> np
[09:30:21] <someotherguy> another wierd thing
[09:30:33] <someotherguy> jquery documentation states that index will return zero-based position of the item
[09:30:42] <someotherguy> even though all the indexes in the documentation are 1
[09:30:43] <someotherguy> not 0
[09:30:58] <someotherguy> and $('body').index() returns 1 not 0
[09:31:03] <someotherguy> how is it zero-based index?
[09:32:55] <Vendethiel1> anybody got tooltip glitches using the position: using: option ?
[09:34:39] <shoky> someotherguy: because <body>'s index is 1, not 0 ?
[09:34:53] <shoky> (it has a previous sibling element..)
[09:49:25] <Ericx2x> why isn't this working? 	$("#barrow").hide();//686

[09:50:53] <Ericx2x> <a class="sliderButton first" id="barrow"   href="timeline.php">READ MORE</a>
[09:51:11] <Ericx2x> easier I made a jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/bT5Uy/
[09:52:40] <shoky> Ericx2x: works fine if you include jquery
[09:52:53] <shoky> Ericx2x: maybe you forgot $(document).ready ?
[09:52:56] <Ericx2x> i wasnt including jquery?
[09:53:03] <shoky> not in the fiddle, no
[09:54:04] <Ericx2x> http://jsfiddle.net/bT5Uy/1/
[09:54:07] <Ericx2x> i'm not sure what to do
[09:54:14] <Ericx2x> can you help write it so it works?
[09:54:31] <shoky> on the left side, where it says No-Library (pure JS)
[09:54:34] <shoky> choose jquery.
[09:56:43] <Ericx2x> oh okay
[09:56:51] <Ericx2x> but now I'm wondering why it doesn't work on my site
[09:56:56] <Ericx2x> I have been using jquery already
[09:57:04] <Ericx2x> yet its not hiding my elements
[10:06:17] <zamba> hi.. i'm using the autocomplete widget that gets data from a remote script.. but when displaying the options to the user i want to display more information that what should be filled in the input field.. is this possible?
[10:06:48] <zamba> kind of like a select tag.. you have option and you have value
[10:10:30] <rmah> why are the jquery-ui themes so crappy?
[10:10:36] <rmah> I mean, the code is awesome
[10:10:39] <rmah> but... jeez
[10:25:57] <jop007_>  how can I align a div element to center and give it a width of 95%?
[10:29:08] <jop007_> I tried style='width:100%;margin-left:2.5%;margin-right:2.5%;
[10:29:40] <imsky> mmrghrh
[10:40:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> jop007_: you try 95% width and then margin: auto
[10:41:53] <jop007_> I tried it that way
[10:42:17] <jop007_> Only when I make the table within the div to 100% something is happening
[10:42:30] <jop007_> <div><table></div>
[10:42:44] <jop007_> I want to center the table horizontally
[10:42:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> jop007_: http://jsfiddle.net/xkh3r/
[10:42:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> btw why are you using tables
[10:42:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> you know that divs can be tables now right?
[10:43:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/d/display/
[10:43:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> jop007_: scroll a bit
[10:43:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> they are there
[10:43:31] <jop007_> since html uses tables for ages
[10:44:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> and now thats changing too
[10:44:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> read link aboove
[10:44:35] <jop007_> another thing when you have images/buttons to control things how can you make them fixed positioned now they are floating since the parent size can change
[10:45:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[10:47:06] <jop007_> the above element is a picture and it's size can differ portrait landscape
[10:50:03] <jop007_> scroll a bit?
[10:53:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> scroll down the link i posted
[10:53:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> it will show you how to use a div as a table
[11:03:12] <Sal> hi, i'm new in jquery and need a hand
[11:03:32] <Sal> is there a way to listen for a click on all table <th> ?
[11:03:40] <Sal> for the click on column heander
[11:03:52] <Sal> do i have to add an onclick on every one?
[11:10:51] <odium> hey, all. I've been mulling over this problem for hours. Not sure how to simply do this. I have an element hidden in a div and I have the div cloned and copied to another div that is overlaid. My problem is, I want to do $('.movie').show() to only show the tag with class 'movie' in the overlaid div and not it's original div. Does that make any sense?
[11:11:53] <odium> is there a $( this > .v ) expression I can use or something?
[11:12:40] <jop007_> I have images with unknown size underneath I want to place two buttons how to fix the buttons to a fixed position?
[11:17:28] <_rgn> odium: $(this).find('.v') or $('.v', this) i think
[11:18:18] <odium> awesome, i'll try that, thanks
[11:22:35] <OfficeDepot0894> Sal: Does each column header need to have a different event attached?
[11:24:15] <OfficeDepot0894> Sal: $('th').on('click',function(e){ // do something });
[11:25:33] <Sal> OfficeDepot0894, thanks
[11:26:59] <OfficeDepot0894> Sal: If you need to know what th was clicked, you might want to use an id, like $('th#foo').on('click',function(e){  // do something on this th click });

[12:52:08] <Fraz> hi
[12:52:19] <Fraz> does anyone know how to get the selected text in a specific div?
[13:26:56] <Fraz> Or does anyone know how to append something at the mouse cursor?
[13:27:29] <Fraz> say when i click a character in a paragraph, insert a <span> before that character?
[13:28:06] <Shazz> So I have a file input and I can do $('input').val() to get the file that was inputted. But if I add a 'multiple' in the input, then $('input').val() only returns one of the files inputted even if I select more than one.
[13:28:35] <Shazz> Fraz: You want the thing to follow the mouse cursor?
[13:30:21] <Fraz> i want to be able to click on some text. say i have the source, <p><span class="start">Hello World<span class="end"></p>
[13:31:41] <Fraz> sorry <p><span class="start">Hello World</span></p>
[13:31:56] <dabear> Fraz: google for document.selection and selectionStart. note that there are different implementations for IE vs other browsers
[13:32:26] <Fraz> and i click the W so the source becomes <p><span class="start">Hello W</span>orld</p>
[13:33:16] <Fraz> dabear thats why im hoping jquery has something useful
[13:33:31] <dabear> not built in, no
[13:34:23] <dabear> http://code.accursoft.com/caret/wiki/Home
[13:35:51] <Fraz> thanks dabear
[13:35:54] * Fraz checks it out
[13:37:37] <Shazz> So I have a file input and I can do $('input').val() to get the file that was inputted. But if I add a 'multiple' in the input, then $('input').val() only returns one of the files inputted even if I select more than one.
[13:40:11] <Fraz> actually what id rather do now i think of it....
[13:40:22] <Fraz> do you know the text selection method on android?
[13:40:32] <Fraz> where you drag 2 handles around?
[13:42:12] <powalowski> #patternhell ftw

[15:25:41] <zandman_26> ?
[15:27:49] <zandman_26> http://jsfiddle.net/Zandman26/DaNCd/
[15:32:44] <zandman_26> got you wiser filipiz?
[15:35:47] <filipiz> zandman_26: propably the problem is because you are using :remote => true â€¦ rails-ujs (probably) intercept the submit event before your submit function and dont let it continue
[15:39:07] <zandman_26> Ah:/ going to test that out, and going to bed. Thx very much for your help filipiz hopefully I dont need to bother you tomorrow:)
[15:41:19] <zandman_26> and it worked like a charm dropping :remote => true:)
[15:46:44] <filipiz> zandman_26: cool :) good night then
[15:47:35] <zandman_26> Need to get better at rails "magic" so these things dont happen. Good night:)
[15:49:42] <alex88> hi guys, CORS requests doesn't need additional jquery side support, I just need to add server headers right?
[16:08:47] <Ericx2x> Hey guys, I have this blue button on the first slide of this slideshow that I want to go to the next slide when clicked. Can someone take a look and see if you can point me in the right direction? http://adapt2.erictheprogrammer.com/timeline.php
[16:10:54] <dwarder> .slideDown what it does to the element?
[16:11:02] <dwarder> i.e. changes css?
[16:11:10] <dwarder> the final stage
[16:11:16] <dwarder> removes display:none?
[16:12:37] <Ericx2x> dwarder are you referring to my question?
[16:13:40] <AlexanderBB10> ladiela
[16:15:09] <anew> anyone know of a decent jq chat plugin... been googling cant find a good one
[16:15:31] <conor_f> I have multiple elements on a page, each with class "trigger". onclick(), I would like for all of that particular trigger's children elements to hide. What should I look up to learn this or how can it be done?
[16:21:24] <grafi> `api on
[16:21:24] <b-ot> grafi: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:21:28] <grafi> `api hide
[16:21:29] <b-ot> grafi: .hide(): Hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/hide/
[16:21:34] <grafi> `api children
[16:21:34] <b-ot> grafi: .children(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[16:21:37] <dwarder> Ericx2x: no, my own
[16:26:16] <conor_f> grafi: yes, I am familiar with all these functions
[16:26:31] <conor_f> but I don't know how to string them together
[16:26:46] <grafi> why not?
[16:26:48] <grafi> :)
[16:27:21] <conor_f> because when I try .children().hide(); it doesn't work
[16:29:20] <conor_f> $(".trigger").click(function() { this.children().hide(); });
[16:29:25] <conor_f> is what I have, but it doesn't work
[16:30:19] <grafi> try $(this)
[16:34:22] <Goopyo> why is already_added giving an undefined error on line 4? http://pastebin.com/W7BmtU9k
[16:40:30] <conor_f> cheers grafi
[16:57:48] <Velveeta> ahoy!
[17:17:33] <filipiz> Goopyo: are you trying to concatenate '_li_' with  already_added ?
[17:17:49] <filipiz> . is used to concatenate at PHP, not JS
[17:18:22] <Goopyo> yeah haha, no idea why I did that considering Im python too
[17:18:23] <Goopyo> http://pastebin.com/SCJFH4kR
[17:18:37] <Goopyo> thats the updated source, but now the counter wont go past 1
[17:24:19] <filipiz> Goopyo: I put your code here http://jsfiddle.net/5TTJe/
[17:24:26] <filipiz> It is working
[17:24:47] <filipiz> if you open the console you'll se the counter growing
[17:25:08] <Goopyo> fuckin A, not sure why it doesn't work when embedded

[18:12:37] <Velveeta> yeah they've made attempts at repealing blue laws in my area before, but people are dumb
[18:13:01] <Velveeta> they're like "oh noooo, people don't need to be drinking that late" or whatever, as if a person can't just buy their booze in advance and drink it anytime they want

[20:31:11] <Erneston> hi
[20:31:32] <Erneston> am trying to trigger a timed even whilst in the hover state only
[20:32:06] <Erneston> currenlty, if i hover the timer is triggered and regardless of if the mouse is hovered or not, 3 seconds later the event is triggered
[20:38:14] <grafi> Erneston and?
[20:38:15] <lobstah> Hey all.   I have the following code/site.  Having a bitch of a time getting it so that when the user selects a menu item, it will collapse back instead of having to manually click menu to collapse (when on a phone) - an help is appreciated!  http://www.summerserver.com/navdemo
[20:40:37] <grafi> lobstah i see nothing expandable/collapsable on that page
[20:40:53] <lobstah> grafi: if you shrink the browser it will be
[20:41:12] <grafi> ah
[20:41:13] <grafi> ok
[20:41:14] <grafi> :P
[20:41:19] <lobstah> grafi: ;)
[20:42:22] <grafi> when the user selects an item, is the content fetched with ajax?
[20:42:40] <grafi> naturally i would expect a page reload and the menu to be closed by that
[20:43:35] <lobstah> grafi:  no - it's using targets to move to a different location on the page (so #itemtogoto)
[20:43:42] <grafi> ah, kay
[20:43:52] <lobstah> grafi:  so it goes to the correct location on the page - but the menu has to be manually collapsed :( -
[20:44:06] <lobstah> grafi:  want them to select it, and it collapses and goes to the correct location
[20:44:15] <grafi> so intercept the click and trigger the menu.slidetoggle in that handler
[20:45:01] <grafi> something like $('nav').on('click', 'a', function() { menu.slideToggle(); return true; })
[20:45:06] <grafi> along those lines
[20:50:12] <lobstah> grafi: thanks! trying to get it to work
[20:50:22] <grafi> good luck
[20:54:16] <lobstah> grafi: it's trying to do something- but what happens is when I click menu to expand and view it, it closes right away, because I've "triggered" the click hehe
[20:54:59] <grafi> oh, i see :D
[20:55:29] <grafi> should probably not bind that to nav then but to the ul
[20:56:17] <grafi> didnt really the #pull was inside the nav :P
[20:56:39] <lobstah> hehe - perfect!  changed it to ul instead of nav - looks good!
[20:56:53] <lobstah> grafi: thank you!
[20:56:58] <grafi> no problem :)

[21:10:48] <grafi> http://stackoverflow.com/a/9880360/826625
[23:42:13] <[E]sc> i have a function that's supposed to be called when the user does something in order to prevent the page from being timed out, however, i've found that even when the user loads to another page or the function is called, the timer is not being reset and continues to countdown.  any ideas? the code is here: http://pastebin.com/PyiTDqSS
[23:48:35] <sahbeewah> [E]sc, need more context
[23:49:17] <sahbeewah> for instance, is that inside an anonymous function?
