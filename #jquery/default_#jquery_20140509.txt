[00:12:24] <Cork> shoky: out of curiosity, why did you kick daitsu?
[00:19:48] <wormmd> Cork: He was porn spamming.
[00:20:25] <wormmd> Cork: or at least I imagine that's what he was going.
[00:20:26] <Cork> ah, in pm?
[00:20:47] <wormmd> Cork: yeah, I got some link that looked like it was for a site of ill repute.
[00:21:18] <Cork> so nice to have +g active sometimes XD
[00:57:52] <svector> how do I pass in options to make JQuery animate to fade a selected element?
[00:58:39] <svector> I'm using a plugin that expects an option like animation: {
[00:58:42] <svector>         open: {height: 'toggle'},
[00:58:43] <svector>         close: {height: 'toggle'},
[00:58:43] <svector>         easing: 'swing',
[00:58:43] <svector>         speed: 500 // opening & closing animation speed
[00:58:43] <svector>     }
[00:59:07] <svector> I dont want to swing the element but fade it in and out
[01:01:06] <brunoais> svector, then you will need a plugin that adds that or jQuery Ui.
[01:01:45] <naschine> $('selector).css({opacity: 1.0, visibility: "visible"}).animate({opacity: 0}, 200);
[01:01:51] <naschine> and it's gone
[01:02:06] <jkarsrud> brunoais: what, why would you need jQ UI for that?
[01:02:47] <brunoais> jkarsrud, doesn't jQuery UI have all those weird, complex or advanced animations?
[01:03:00] <brunoais> and I mentioned a plugin without being jQuery UI too
[01:03:39] <brunoais> anyway
[01:03:48] <brunoais> for animations I always go for CSS animations
[01:03:55] <jkarsrud> perhaps, but iirc it just uses jquery animate under the hood anyway. There's nothing you can't animate the way you want using plain old jQuery, without any plugins at all :
[01:03:56] <brunoais> so I'm outdated with jQuery's
[01:03:57] <jkarsrud> :)*
[01:04:09] <jkarsrud> Me too ;)
[01:04:33] <jkarsrud> I was just curious why you would recommend a big dep like jQUI for such a basic animation :)
[01:04:44] <brunoais> I'm still looking for a good polyfill fallback for the poor other guys
[01:04:58] <brunoais> because he wants to config in advance
[01:05:16] <brunoais> not mentioning each time the animation happens
[01:06:08] <brunoais> jkarsrud, ^
[01:06:15] <jkarsrud> ah, but that's just the swing easing. I guess you'd need somehting like the jquery.easing plugin for something like fade-in-out stuff
[01:06:44] <brunoais> I have absolutely no idea
[01:06:46] <jkarsrud> brunoais: I just read the whole question now, didn't mean to sound that harsh earlier :)
[01:06:54] <brunoais> jkarsrud, you weren't
[01:06:58] <brunoais> I was cool all the time
[01:07:00] <jkarsrud> :)
[01:07:04] <brunoais> I'm very efusive
[01:07:34] <brunoais> tell things as they are (or I think they are, no regardless if I'm right or horribly wrong)
[01:07:47] <brunoais> (I don't always learn the right way :S)
[01:08:34] <brunoais> jkarsrud, not until I'm forced to work with animations of browsers that do not support them, I'll continue using only CSS animations
[01:08:52] <jkarsrud> Hehe
[01:09:08] <jkarsrud> Usually I skip animations completely for browsers that don't support them
[01:09:48] <svector> I'm not actually doing the animations it's the noty plugin( http://ned.im/noty/#api)
[01:10:07] <svector> and the notifications have a sliding effect which is annoying
[01:10:26] <svector> I want to turn that off and make the notifications fade in and out
[01:11:57] <svector> naschine, I don't think I can select the element like that
[01:12:02] <svector> I have to pass my options
[01:12:27] <jkarsrud> I suppose you can do that using something like the easeIn easing, and set open to map to the opacity of the property instead
[01:12:40] <jkarsrud> or use the specialEasing property of jquery.animate
[01:12:47] <jkarsrud> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[01:14:21] <brunoais> svector, if you don't want javascript animations, just turn them off
[01:16:21] <svector> brunoais, other parts of the page need it. I just want to turn of animations from this plugin( http://ned.im/noty/#api)
[01:16:27] <svector> brunoais, thanks for the help BTW
[01:16:40] <brunoais> svector, :S
[01:18:02] <brunoais> svector, can't you just give a speed of 1 (or something like that) to it? Or a null to the easing?
[01:21:33] <_biff> hi. i would have general qeustion about getting ajax response..
[01:23:23] <_biff> i have several js classes, one of them is the ajax class including call get responses etc...every class can call this ajax class. how should i handle the response, or where...in the ajax class or in the given class which has called the ajax function(s)
[01:24:19] <_biff> which would be the "proper"
[01:24:28] <Cork> _biff: that question is too generic
[01:24:51] <Cork> so it is close to impossible to answer it
[01:25:08] <_biff> aham
[01:25:09] <svector> brunoais, thanks man just make the speed 10 and the sliding effect is now not visible
[01:25:51] <ophi491> Has anyone used sandboxxing when making a google chrome extension?
[01:26:01] <Cork> _biff: it is kinda like going to a car mechanic and saying "i have a problem with my car, what is the best way to fix it"
[01:26:21] <_biff> Cork i thought only that every class should handle the datas what it want to get
[01:26:36] <Cork> _biff: well ya?
[01:26:38] <_biff> so i thouhgt ajax class shouldnt be handle for example printing the html
[01:26:53] <Cork> _biff: also js doesn't really have classes
[01:26:58] <_biff> yeees
[01:27:02] <_biff> but...
[01:27:25] <_biff> u understand i think:D
[01:27:33] <Cork> i don't...
[01:27:38] <_biff> :)
[01:27:53] <Cork> if you mean you have an object and want it to be able to use an object helper for ajax calls
[01:28:03] <Cork> and you want the callback data to the first object
[01:28:09] <_biff> cork yes
[01:28:12] <Cork> ...
[01:28:19] <Cork> that makes a lot more sense
[01:28:51] <Cork> _biff: you can set the context variable for $.ajax
[01:29:03] <Cork> and have it pass the reference to the original object to it
[01:29:03] <_biff> öm...
[01:29:13] <Cork> or you could use promise
[01:29:22] <Cork> and have the calling object use it to bind the handler it self
[01:29:40] <DarsVaeda> where do I finnd localizations for the datepicker for a specific version of jquery-ui?
[01:31:14] <_biff> cork thx im going to check this context option...
[01:33:45] <Cork> DarsVaeda: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/1.9.2/ui/i18n
[01:34:41] <DarsVaeda> thx
[01:34:58] <DarsVaeda> can someone put that into the docu please?
[01:39:58] <Cork> DarsVaeda: you prob need to file a bug somewhere about it
[01:47:55] <DarsVaeda> hmm...have to create a login for this probably -.-
[01:51:03] <wormmd> This fiddle throws an security error which I believe to be unrelated to the code, but works otherwise. This same snippet doesn't work in my application, however: jQuery throws 'undefined is not a function' when registering handlers. Thoughts? Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/wormmd/qLmtu/
[01:52:28] <brunoais> wormmd, why are you using the ":input" selector?
[01:53:45] <wormmd> brunoais: it goes in a backbone app, inputs should be scoped to the view that created them.
[01:54:08] <wormmd> brunoais: though I suppose it wouldn't hurt to throw a name on the radio inputs...
[01:54:13] <brunoais> you are getting too complex there :S
[01:54:36] <brunoais> radio boxes need a <form> even though they don't need a name
[01:54:45] <brunoais> wormmd, why not just use a normal CSS selector?
[01:54:48] <wormmd> I'm reinventing the wheel and implementing two way data binding.
[01:55:00] <brunoais> I dunno what that is, sorry
[01:55:09] <wormmd> Yeeeaaahhh...
[01:55:52] <brunoais> wormmd, what do you want, more exactly?
[01:56:35] <wormmd> I want to select a set of input elements (in this case, radio buttons) and set the checked property of the one that matches a data set.
[01:57:03] <brunoais> wormmd, why not do that directly in the HTML when it comes from the server?
[01:57:08] <wormmd> I stored this data when the user input it. Now, I need to repopulate the input elements the user selected when they come back.
[01:57:22] <brunoais> wormmd, come back from where?
[01:57:47] <wormmd> brunoais: it's a Backbone app, the html gets generated on the fly based on a template and a data model.
[01:58:26] <brunoais> wormmd, why replace DOM elements instead of just hidding them?
[01:58:44] <brunoais> if you need them back, just hide them or remove them from the DOM and then place them back
[01:58:50] <brunoais> wormmd, simple as that
[01:59:11] <brunoais> removeChild(); appendChild()
[01:59:20] <brunoais> or the jQuery counterparts
[01:59:42] <brunoais> wormmd, I dunno how backbone works
[01:59:46] <wormmd> Not really, unfortunately there's a lot of domain-specific knowledge that I can't go into, I was just looking for a solution to that snippet.
[02:00:08] <brunoais> wormmd, is that HTML correct according to the real page?
[02:00:29] <wormmd> Once it's rendered, yes.
[02:01:20] <brunoais> wormmd, why not just a simple search with the selector?
[02:01:40] <brunoais> you have all the data you need
[02:02:05] <brunoais> wormmd, how much do you know about CSS3 selectors?
[02:03:52] <wormmd> A fair amount.
[02:04:41] <brunoais> wormmd, ok, let me try to see how should I help you
[02:04:54] <brunoais> wormmd, this selector:
[02:04:57] <brunoais> #someId
[02:05:04] <brunoais> is a simplification of an actual selector
[02:05:13] <brunoais> wormmd, do you know what that selector is?
[02:07:24] <wormmd> brunoais: it's an id selector, and I think we're just having a miscommunication. I'm moving on to another avenue of approach for this problem.
[02:07:41] <brunoais> wormmd, completely new?
[02:07:56] <brunoais> I thought I had something for ya but ok. Good luck
[02:08:29] <brunoais> anyway, just fyi, you didn't answer to the question
[02:09:05] <wormmd> I'm just running through different ways of selecting the elements I want.
[02:09:27] <wormmd> And $('#someId') selects the element with the id 'someId'.
[02:12:04] <brunoais> wormmd, you still didn't answer my question
[02:12:08] <brunoais> :)
[02:12:19] <brunoais> I'm not asking what does #someid selects
[02:12:31] <brunoais> I'm saying it is a simplification I.e. sugar syntax
[02:12:47] <brunoais> wormmd, what is it sugar syntax for?
[02:12:57] <brunoais> (ups
[02:13:04] <brunoais> I didn't word that right)
[02:13:20] <brunoais> wormmd, what is the exapansion of that specific sugar syntax?
[02:13:25] <brunoais> I'm trying to help you, man
[02:16:23] <Cork> wormmd: .prop('checked', true).bind(ctx); bind(ctx) doens't make sense there
[02:16:42] <Cork> why do you want to override the this object for .prop?
[02:16:57] <Cork> or rather jquery
[02:17:31] <brunoais> Cork, yeah. I noticed that too
[02:17:44] <brunoais> Cork, I just wish He'd listen to me
[02:18:12] <brunoais> if he does not want help, so be it. What a waste of my time... (trying to help someone who does not want to learn)
[02:18:35] <Cork> brunoais: start with questions if you don't understand what the goal i
[02:18:36] <Cork> +s
[02:18:52] <brunoais> Cork, I already know what he wants
[02:19:04] <brunoais> I got everything. It's deadly simple
[02:19:22] <brunoais> just a single CSS selector + killing some code does the trick
[02:20:15] <brunoais> Cork, I just seriously think he does not want help, by his answers. He only wants the answer.
[02:20:41] <Cork> brunoais: except for the .bind call i don't see any thing wrong with his code
[02:20:50] <Cork> so no i don't really agree
[02:21:00] <brunoais> Cork, I see weird stuff there
[02:22:12] <Cork> i see a few points i want more info about
[02:22:22] <Cork> but no there isn't much that is wrong with it
[02:33:42] <user258467> Hi, can someone tell me why th ebackground doesn't go to red when hover in this script http://jsfiddle.net/8BXkt/
[02:35:01] <StephenS> user258467 there: http://jsfiddle.net/8BXkt/1/
[02:36:39] <user258467> StephenS, thanks but I poorly expressed my self I would the backgrounf of the li with Text become red after hover
[02:37:23] <StephenS> only li or whole background?
[02:37:39] <user258467> StephenS, only li :)
[02:37:57] <StephenS> why do yo use jquery then? o.
[02:39:00] <user258467> StephenS, hum you're right I think I don't take the problem correctly
[02:41:24] <StephenS> yes and user258467 you don't have resets.
[02:43:34] <StephenS> user258467 like this: http://jsfiddle.net/8BXkt/2/
[02:47:17] <user258467> StephenS, in fact I only need to hide/display the background I try to mock this menu http://www.chronodrive.com/refonte/home/page
[02:48:01] <StephenS> you mean on focus?
[02:48:13] <StephenS> when you focus certain input box, to gray bg?
[02:49:31] <user258467> StephenS, yes the gray bg
[03:38:10] <brunoais> Question: Is there a way to, having a DOM element (or a jQuery wrapped DOM element), find all CSS rules that are being applied to that element?
[03:38:32] <Cork> brunoais: no not if you actually want the rules
[03:39:34] <brunoais> Cork, Hum... Ok. Then I'll have to take a different, not-so-reusable-code approach. Thanks
[03:39:53] <Cork> brunoais: what are you trying to do?
[03:40:21] <brunoais> Cork, I'm trying to make a generator of multiple rules for a set of elements
[03:40:44] <brunoais> I want each element that is direct child to another to have specific behaviors in terms of animation
[03:40:57] <brunoais> They animate when elements are placed between them
[03:41:14] <brunoais> ... while they adjust to the new set of elements
[03:41:38] <brunoais> and I didn't want to keep on changing CSS styles inline and such
[03:42:01] <brunoais> so I'm generating a stylesheet when it loads
[03:42:20] <brunoais> and I'm trying to make it more general when I just need to tell where the "items" in the DOM are
[03:42:53] <Cork> ya?
[03:42:55] <brunoais> then It would use the longest CSS rule applied to the items as a base (so that it can always overrule them)
[03:43:07] <Cork> ah
[03:43:14] <brunoais> not only that
[03:43:18] <Cork> so you would get the selector from the css file?
[03:43:27] <brunoais> Cork, yes
[03:43:30] <Cork> you can do that though it needs quite a bit of coding
[03:43:34] <brunoais> yeah
[03:43:40] <brunoais> that's why I'm givin up on that approach
[03:43:46] <Cork> all rules is listed in document.styleSheets
[03:43:51] <brunoais> and I'm using one that is more hardcoded but more simple to udnerstand
[03:43:58] <brunoais> yeah
[03:43:58] <Cork> you would have to loop them and check if they match the element
[03:44:09] <brunoais> but that's super slow to execute
[03:44:14] <Cork> ya
[03:44:15] <brunoais> it's O(n) and it is in js
[03:44:44] <brunoais> so I'm taking a different approach
[03:44:49] <brunoais> I dunno if it is better
[03:45:04] <brunoais> but it will be more hardcoded
[03:45:50] <Cork> brunoais: you could possibly use something like https://github.com/tildeio/selector-generator
[03:48:18] <brunoais> Cork, the code seems interesting
[03:48:20] <brunoais> thanks
[03:48:41] <Cork> brunoais: there are multiple different similar projects
[03:48:47] <Cork> so it might not be the best one
[03:48:56] <Cork> it's just one in the list of matches
[03:50:06] <brunoais> ok
[03:50:25] <brunoais> Cork, I do like, though, that is not dependent of jQuery
[03:50:55] <Cork> brunoais: well there isn't much need to depend on jquery
[03:51:14] <brunoais> yep
[03:51:16] <brunoais> still
[03:51:23] <Cork> but sure you could build one that creates selectors from .parents()
[03:51:25] <brunoais> loads of code snippets make themselves dependent of jQuery
[03:51:37] <brunoais> sure ;)
[03:51:59] <Cork> and ya wouldn't be surprise if there was a project like that
[03:53:59] <brunoais> anyway. I'm not going to use it
[03:54:12] <brunoais> it does not do what I want but it has given me really interesting ideas
[03:54:16] <brunoais> thank you
[03:54:18] <Cork> brunoais: ex. http://davecardwell.co.uk/javascript/jquery/plugins/jquery-getpath/
[03:54:54] <Cork> that one seams to generate slow selectors for no good reason though
[03:55:30] <brunoais> Cork, yeah
[03:55:37] <brunoais> it could just stop at 1st id
[03:55:48] <Cork> ya, that too
[03:55:51] <brunoais> or have an option for such
[03:55:58] <Cork> and it could select based on id and not element + id
[03:56:10] <Cork> as it will actually first filter all elements
[03:56:16] <Cork> and then filter those based on id
[03:56:28] <Cork> i seriously wonder why this is so common for ppl to do
[03:56:40] <brunoais> Cork, it's because of sizzle
[03:56:46] <brunoais> it was like that long ago
[03:56:56] <Cork> brunoais: what do you mean?
[03:57:12] <brunoais> Cork, sizzle was not using getElementById()
[03:57:23] <Cork> brunoais: sure so?
[03:57:28] <brunoais> Cork, nor even querySelector()
[03:57:36] <Cork> brunoais: i'm talking about ul#somid vs #someid
[03:57:40] <brunoais> now it uses querySelector() when possible
[03:57:44] <brunoais> Cork, yeah
[03:57:53] <brunoais> it was not using getElementById()
[03:58:00] <Cork> it has nothing do do with getElementById
[03:58:01] <brunoais> jQuery was
[03:58:11] <brunoais> it has that shortcut in the code
[03:58:17] <Cork> sure and?
[03:58:18] <brunoais> but sizzle doesn't
[03:58:20] <brunoais> well
[03:58:23] <brunoais> it wasn't doing
[03:58:43] <brunoais> it's so that it does a getElementsByTagName() first
[03:58:49] <brunoais> and then filter on that
[03:58:54] <brunoais> well
[03:58:56] <Cork> brunoais: css selectors where you do div#something {} is slower then #something {}
[03:58:59] <brunoais> not that most ppl do know about that
[03:59:02] <Cork> it has nothing to do with js or jquery
[03:59:34] <brunoais> Cork, it's before DOM had querySelector() used enough so that Sizzle would have it incorporated
[03:59:45] <Cork> brunoais: and querySelectorAll('#something') is basically as fast as getElementById('something')
[03:59:56] <Cork> brunoais: you missing the point
[03:59:58] <brunoais> Cork, yeah. The difference is quite small
[04:00:01] <Cork> no
[04:00:05] <Cork> you missing the point
[04:00:08] <brunoais> oh
[04:00:12] <brunoais> pls do explain
[04:00:16] <Cork> div#something
[04:00:27] <Cork> splitting that the way css selector works means
[04:00:31] <Cork> find all divs
[04:00:41] <Cork> from the list find the one that matches the hash something
[04:00:46] <Cork> instead of #something
[04:00:54] <Cork> that just say find the element pointed to by the hash something
[04:01:09] <Cork> the browser has a hash table for ids
[04:01:28] <Cork> and if you put an element name infront of the id you throw away speed for no good reason
[04:02:05] <Cork> as it asks the browser to walk the dom tree and collect all elements with the tagName "div"
[04:02:19] <Cork> BEFORE it looks in the id hash table
[04:04:16] <brunoais> Cork, yeah. true
[04:04:44] <brunoais> the issue is that most people don't know that such hash table exists
[04:05:08] <Cork> brunoais: my frustration is about why it is so very common for ppl to do this seed deoptimization all the time
[04:05:41] <brunoais> Cork, and on IE7, impressively, 'div#something > .otherThing' is faster than '#something > .otherThing' on sizzle of that time
[04:05:44] <Cork> brunoais: well it doens't make sense to me even without knowing it
[04:06:13] <brunoais> It's because of old tests
[04:06:19] <brunoais> really outdated stuff
[04:06:27] <brunoais> and also recommendations that are years outdated
[04:06:48] <Cork> and recommendations from ppl that haven't tested there recommendations as far as i can tell
[04:07:23] <Cork> brunoais: btw i've been using jquery for a long long time ;)
[04:07:29] <Cork> i know it's history with sizzle
[04:07:40] <brunoais> I tested it on native IE7 in a virtual machine with also firefox and chrome
[04:07:55] <brunoais> it actually holds true O_O
[04:07:56] <brunoais> somehow
[04:08:19] <brunoais> well it was 1 or 2 years ago, though
[04:08:26] <brunoais> (most probably 2)
[04:08:28] <Cork> brunoais: well for a start i still think it uses document.all
[04:08:47] <brunoais> Cork, at this time?
[04:08:52] <Cork> ie7 yes
[04:08:55] <brunoais> Ah!
[04:09:04] <brunoais> that's why I wasn't finding getElementById
[04:09:19] <brunoais> I always forget that IE extension
[04:09:25] <Cork> ie7 was the first step to get to standard compliance
[04:09:31] <brunoais> yep
[04:09:37] <Cork> so they had to do a lot of tinkering to get things to still work
[04:10:03] <Cork> heck the web is broken enough to have to have a none working document.all in the html spec :/
[04:10:24] <brunoais> the problem with the all property is that it is not well scalable
[04:10:33] <brunoais> and it actually does not tell what is it about
[04:10:37] <brunoais> is it all elements?
[04:10:42] <brunoais> if so, how do you have them?
[04:10:48] <brunoais> how do I identify them?
[04:11:09] <brunoais> getElementById() is simple and it's one of the "exactly what it says on the tin"
[04:11:18] <brunoais> which is why I like it a lot ^^
[04:11:24] <brunoais> anyway
[04:11:36] <Cork> brunoais: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#dom-document-all
[04:11:41] <brunoais> Cork, div#something, for me, is still broken
[04:11:58] <Cork> brunoais: ya, that those are still the ones i see
[04:12:05] <Cork> not selectors
[04:12:10] <Cork> but elements + id
[04:12:33] <brunoais> Wait, what?
[04:12:40] <brunoais> they put it back again?
[04:12:46] <Cork> document.all?
[04:12:52] <Cork> it is a minimal version
[04:13:10] <Cork> just the absolutely needed parts to keep the web working
[04:13:20] <Cork> so no it isn't document.all
[04:13:34] <Cork> it is enough to get past the tests in many pages
[04:14:00] <brunoais> I c...
[04:14:13] <brunoais> just a patch to avoid breaking the interwebz
[04:14:25] <Cork> well not just interweb sadly
[04:14:36] <brunoais> btw, that jQuery plugin
[04:14:43] <brunoais> it didn't even had to be a jQuery plugin
[04:14:49] <brunoais> but ok...
[04:45:57] <rindolf> Hi all.
[04:58:48] <brunoais> hey rindolf
[04:59:04] <rindolf> brunoais: what's up?
[04:59:26] <brunoais> rindolf, I'm trying to make a list animate as I move stuffa round
[04:59:36] <brunoais> not working as well as I wanted
[04:59:41] <rindolf> brunoais: ah.
[04:59:43] <brunoais> so I'm trying a different approach
[04:59:54] <brunoais> Lol
[05:00:09] <brunoais> too much flood here, it seems
[05:45:19] <pcfreak30> I need a text box, a button, and a link inline on one row. How can I do this in JQ mobile as i have tried every suggestion I could find on google without luck.
[05:50:54] <BinaryKitten> pcfreak30 use css?
[05:51:03] <BinaryKitten> oh jquery mobile
[05:51:13] * BinaryKitten doesn't know..
[05:55:10] <BaNzounet> Hey guys, if I want to load jQuery inside a iframe I though that passing the jQuery element would be nice to avoid loading twice the same resource, but the problem is that I'm just binding the parent jQuery to the iframe so when I'm manipuling the selector I'm playing with the parent's DOM :s Is there a solution for that ? (I don't really want to load twice the same script :/)
[05:56:01] <xec> BaNzounet: if the iframe links to the same jquery source file the browser will have it cached already
[05:56:18] <BaNzounet> okay so it's not a problem :)
[05:56:24] <xec> yep :)
[05:56:31] <BaNzounet> thank
[05:56:35] <xec> np
[06:08:34] <StephenS> onkeyup="showLive();"
[06:08:56] <StephenS> this works when I type letters and numbers, but from the moment I hit space, function does not execute, why?
[06:09:42] <seutje> keyup should trigger for space
[06:09:46] <seutje> keycode 32 iirc
[06:11:08] <StephenS> well it does not, dunno why
[06:12:11] <xec> StephenS: sounds strange, can you make a demo?
[06:12:39] <StephenS> I think load is an issue
[06:13:33] <StephenS> function showLive(str) { $("#livesearch").load("/livesearch.php?q="+str .... }
[06:13:45] <StephenS> so str whitespace is missing I guess
[06:14:16] <StephenS> in console log is asd d, instead of asd+d
[06:14:25] <StephenS> It needs to be passed via url with plus.
[06:14:45] <xec> .replace() it?
[06:15:04] <StephenS> that might help
[06:15:40] <StephenS> I don't know how it should be passed though, q=asd%20d
[06:15:52] <StephenS> thats when I type it via get method/
[06:16:09] <StephenS> but since I do only .load() I have no idea how it should be passed.
[06:18:58] <Cork> StephenS: i would use $.get instead
[06:19:19] <StephenS> ok probably the easiest method to solve this issue
[06:19:22] <StephenS> Ill get back to you
[06:19:37] <Cork> StephenS: $.get("/livesearch.php", { p = str }).done(function(data) { $("#livesearch").html(data); })
[06:19:42] <Cork> opps
[06:19:46] <Cork> StephenS: $.get("/livesearch.php", { p: str }).done(function(data) { $("#livesearch").html(data); })
[06:19:47] <StephenS> ..
[06:23:09] <StephenS> works Cork :)
[06:23:17] <StephenS> just a tip, p should be q, as q is my get query.
[06:23:33] <Cork> lol
[06:23:36] <Cork> typo :/
[06:25:23] <BillCriswell> Man, this form has 166 fields all together (including checkboxes and stuff) but that's still terrifying.
[06:25:30] <drej> holy shit
[06:25:59] <drej> BillCriswell there are some forms im working on right now that are ~500-600 but they're generated automagically and are over several "steps"
[06:27:07] <BillCriswell> drej: This is one step. It's an events form so there's like categories and stuff to check (which I think should be tags) and a lot of it is from the wild specs for the repeating dates stuff they want.
[06:27:11] <christophe_v_e> Hi, I'm working on a countdown & play sound once the countdown is done - however I can't get it to work on mobile / ios - any particular reason that migh be? http://carolineverellen.be/timer/timer_ultrashort.html
[06:28:18] <BillCriswell> drej: You can seriously do like "Repeat this event every Monday and Tuesday from March the 3rd to 16th but not on Thursdays" type shit.
[06:28:45] <drej> BillCriswell yeah im doing something similar, its an event for a safety inspection of checking machinery
[06:28:53] <drej> so a single peiece of equipment could have 200 points of inspection
[06:28:56] <drej> each one could trigger 10-15 steps
[06:29:03] <drej> and conditional structure
[06:29:04] <drej> and comments
[06:29:05] <BillCriswell> Well.... "not a tuesday that falls on the 12th" or something, not Thurdays obviously haha.
[06:29:06] <drej> and ratings
[06:29:07] <drej> etc etc
[06:29:22] <BillCriswell> Sounds nuts.
[06:29:36] <drej> yeah its intense
[06:29:51] <drej> oh and its all on mobile
[06:30:02] <drej> usable forms on mobile are a nightmare
[06:30:10] <BillCriswell> drej: Dealing with dates and stuff is the time I really appreciate the human brain. We have no problem following that, coding it out logically is just a nightmare.
[06:30:23] <BillCriswell> drej: Yeah, this is responsive. It's not fun at all.
[06:31:53] <StephenS> Cork I get data via ajax post method, and append it like this: $("#updates").append(html);
[06:32:15] <StephenS> The problem is, appended data/text is not affected by existing javascript/jquery on the page where updates id is on, what might be the issue?
[06:32:48] <Cork> StephenS: most likely cause you add the event listeners directly on those dynamic elements
[06:32:48] <christophe_v_e> I'm really wondering why some js & jquery work fine in my browser but not on iOs
[06:32:55] <Cork> StephenS: delegate them to a static parent
[06:33:25] <Cork> $('statis parent').on('event', 'selector from the parent to the child', func)
[06:33:27] <Cork> that should work
[06:35:54] <nisseni> I'm updating a list with currencies from an API, what is the best practice to have a loading image when making the GET?
[06:44:52] <StephenS> which is kinda not easy at all, I have like a lot of classes in there Cork
[06:45:40] <BillCriswell> nisseni: You show a div when the action takes place, you run the request, you hide the div when it's complete.
[06:46:05] <Cork> StephenS: well the only other option is to rebind the listeners when you replace the elements
[06:46:12] <nisseni> BillCriswell: ok, thought so, thanks
[06:46:17] <StephenS> how that?
[06:54:26] <christophe_v_e> I'm really wondering why some js & jquery work fine in my browser but not on iOs
[06:55:33] <Sergonium> because apple
[07:01:19] <StephenS> yeah switch to some other fruit
[07:03:39] <SiskOZ> hello
[07:23:36] <jrm2k6> Is there a way I can pass data to my handlers for a .hover() call?
[07:24:04] <jrm2k6> like i would do with a on("mouseover", {mydata:_mydata}, handler)
[07:25:05] <BillCriswell> jrm2k6: Have you tried that?
[07:25:11] <BillCriswell> Oh, reversed it lol
[07:25:14] <jrm2k6> :D
[07:26:02] <jrm2k6> http://api.jquery.com/hover/ it doesnt seem to specify it is possible
[07:26:03] <BillCriswell> jrm2k6: You might need to use mouseenter and mouseleave events.
[07:26:10] <dinho> hello, someone could help me with this quest?  I am trying to retrieve value from dorpdown to loop wordpress  I can not pass the value of the dropdown to the loop
[07:26:17] <jrm2k6> BillCriswell: ok, thats what i was afaird of
[07:26:20] <dinho> http://pastebin.com/Hmr3sZXn
[07:26:20] <StanAccy> Ive currenetly got a click handler attached to: $('body') - however, when the body is small, and the user clicks somewhere on the browser window, my click event isnt fired since the user isnt clicking on the <body>.  Can I attach a click handler to something higher up the hierarchy to detect clicks within the browser window?
[07:26:31] <jrm2k6> hover() seems nice cause you can fadeIn on an invisible div
[07:27:08] <BillCriswell> .on({ mouseenter: handler, mouseleave: handler}, { extras: "foo" }); should work if you want to pass data to both?
[07:27:19] <BillCriswell> jrm2k6: Not sure I'm following you there.
[07:27:22] <dinho> how to pass the dropdown value to a variable?
[07:27:50] <drej> variable = $('select').val();
[07:27:54] <drej> or .attr('value');
[07:28:18] <jrm2k6> BillCriswell: yep this is what i am doing
[07:28:26] <jrm2k6> i wanted to know if osmething like that was possible with hover
[07:28:28] <jrm2k6> not on
[07:28:33] <dinho> could help me? jquery not understand. 'm php
[07:28:42] <BillCriswell> Is it that big of a difference?
[07:29:01] <StanAccy> samwe goes for attaching a click handler to 'html' - when the page is small, the <html> element doesnt span the entire browser window
[07:29:06] <BillCriswell> .hover() is exactly this: $( selector ).mouseenter( handlerIn ).mouseleave( handlerOut );
[07:29:34] <dinho> here my form with loop wordpress  http://pastebin.com/Hmr3sZXn
[07:30:34] <BillCriswell> StanAccy: $(document) would work.
[07:30:42] <nisseni> BillCriswell: what's most common, to have a css loading animation or an image?
[07:30:56] <StanAccy> BillCriswell: oh, of course - thanks!
[07:31:04] <BillCriswell> StanAccy: No problem.
[07:31:42] <StanAccy> actually, I just tested attaching it to html and it works, despite the Chrome inspector only showing me that the <html> element only fills about 20px of the top portion of the window
[07:32:01] <BillCriswell> nisseni: I have no idea. I think whatever is least heavy would be the best bet, so you don't have to preload a loading gif haha
[07:32:01] <StanAccy> are events attached to 'html' treated like document?
[07:32:43] <nisseni> BillCriswell: I guess, but then again css animation isn't browser wide
[07:33:09] <BillCriswell> nisseni: I'd just go with a div with the word "loading".
[07:33:30] <nisseni> BillCriswell: sooo boring! ;)
[07:34:18] <BillCriswell> Spending that much time on shit people hate to see seems weird to me haha.
[07:34:26] <nisseni> hehe
[07:34:31] <jrm2k6> BillCriswell: I would go for a div with loading too haha
[07:38:26] <cnap> hey guys
[07:38:31] <cnap> I have a long question for u
[07:38:55] <cnap> I am echoing an html table with an edit button in it
[07:39:00] <cnap> each row can me edited
[07:39:16] <cnap> and I want when the user clicks edit the row of table to turn into editable stuff
[07:39:25] <cnap> So i have done this part
[07:39:36] <cnap> I also have a cancel button being rendered when the user clicks Edit
[07:39:44] <cnap> and I want to revert back to the original html of this row
[07:39:49] <cnap> what is the better way?
[07:39:59] <cnap> and easiest one
[07:40:18] <drej> that was long indeed
[07:40:27] <cnap> I tried to get the html data with data(), html() and clone() but it gets only the value of it
[07:40:32] <cnap> hehe I told you
[07:40:51] <jrm2k6> so what do you have already?
[07:41:00] <jrm2k6> I have done something kinda similar, except the cancel part
[07:41:02] <drej> everything minus "revert to original value"
[07:41:07] <jrm2k6> ok
[07:41:11] <jrm2k6> so i am no help here
[07:41:11] <jrm2k6> :D
[07:41:16] <drej> cnap basically when you hit edit, grab the value of it, or on page load, and attach it to a .data() attribute of that element
[07:41:22] <drej> then go back and pull that .data() value when you cancel
[07:41:22] <cnap> here is my current code: http://bpaste.net/show/nb3jA8NiMzWJL2Qplvgt/
[07:41:27] <cnap> sorry if it looks crappy
[07:42:12] <drej> cnap ive done it in the past where on page load, i iterate through every element, and attach a .data() attribute to it that has the original value inside it
[07:42:15] <drej> that you can then grab whenever you want
[07:43:37] <cnap> in my current login cant I just grab the html of the elements I use replaceWith
[07:43:41] <cnap> and restore it ?
[07:44:07] <drej> as long as the page doesnt refresh
[07:44:20] <cnap> nah it doesnt refresh anyhow
[07:44:29] <cnap> but I used data and clone
[07:44:37] <cnap> and they only seem to fetch me the tags value
[07:44:43] <cnap> i want the whole html
[07:44:48] <cnap> so I can replace it again later on
[07:47:58] <cnap> so once again I have this html: <td id="comm_1">lalalala</td>
[07:48:07] <cnap> I want to copy whole of it and I know its id
[07:50:09] <NoiseEee> var aCopy = $('#comm_1').clone(true)
[07:51:04] <NoiseEee> form values aren't cloned
[07:51:07] <NoiseEee> its a beeyatch
[07:51:25] <cnap> hmm
[07:51:28] <cnap> ok let me test
[07:51:39] <cnap> and then I just use replaceWith on it ?
[07:52:45] <NoiseEee> im not sure what your issue is
[07:53:03] <cnap> I have one more issue
[07:53:13] <cnap> I am turning the Edit button into 2 buttons called Save and Cancel
[07:53:22] <cnap> I want when the user clicks Cancel to revert back
[07:53:28] <NoiseEee> but right now, you're not saving the original td anywhere
[07:53:44] <NoiseEee> i mean you *think* you are, but only in the scope of that function
[07:53:44] <cnap> so either I write a diff function for cancel button but I dont have the cloned data
[07:53:52] <cnap> exactly
[07:53:59] <NoiseEee> so store it in a global object
[07:54:04] <NoiseEee> s/global/accessible
[07:54:46] <NoiseEee> var window.originalTDs = {};  window.originalTDs.comm_11 = $('#comm_11').clone(true);
[07:56:54] <cnap> yes thats what I did, it doesnt work for another reason I think
[07:56:58] <cnap> let me investigate
[07:57:07] <cnap> I wish I knew perfect jquery it would have been awesome
[07:57:51] <cnap> I have one more tiny issue now :D
[07:58:04] <cnap> inside the click event I am creating a cancel button with a class
[07:58:13] <cnap> but it seems that the click function I wrote for it, doesnt see it
[07:58:22] <cnap> apparently because when DOM loads it isnt loaded yet
[07:58:28] <NoiseEee> right
[07:58:37] <cnap> so either I could pre-form it
[07:58:41] <cnap> I mean put it in form
[07:58:52] <cnap> which I dont like and doesnt seem so good solution
[07:58:56] <NoiseEee> no, use event delegation
[07:59:34] <NoiseEee> $('someParent').on('click','button.cancel_but',function(e) { })
[08:00:12] <cnap> hmmm
[08:00:32] <cnap> so this is gonna create an button when someParent is clicked ?
[08:01:12] <NoiseEee> no, that's what you'd use as your single listener for all present/future cancel buttons
[08:01:13] <cnap> oh no I get it now
[08:01:17] <NoiseEee> put it on a parent thats always there
[08:02:00] <cnap> will this work with <input class="cancel_but" type="button" value="Cancel" /> ?
[08:02:04] <cnap> or does it need the other kind of button
[08:03:27] <NoiseEee> you should use a proper <button>
[08:04:04] <cnap> my code looks like http://bpaste.net/show/T6xSMPVTaNZr2rmnnxHG/
[08:04:12] <cnap> but doesnt work. I'll try button ok
[08:05:11] <NoiseEee> $('table').on('click','button.cancel_but',function(e) {})
[08:05:36] <NoiseEee> do your examples in a jsfiddle showing whats wrong etc, but good luck
[08:05:57] <cnap> thank you sir for the nice help
[08:07:49] <cnap> :S doenst work even if I put the tables class in the delegator
[08:12:30] <cnap> ok made this http://jsfiddle.net/DzVBs/1/

[08:58:59] <BillCriswell> My god I hate so many websites lately.
[08:59:05] <duch_kazatel> WORD
[08:59:33] <rindolf> BillCriswell: like what?
[09:00:38] <BillCriswell> Looking up the origin of @ and the first website has a full screen video for 20 seconds, the second one has some velociraptor eating my screen, the third one let me read for a bit then about 10 seconds in scrolled to the top of the screen then showed me an ad.
[09:01:28] <BillCriswell> Hopefully Google can pick up on this shit in the near future and offer my filter options for websites.
[09:01:48] <BillCriswell> [â] Useful Information
[09:01:57] <BillCriswell> [ ] Velociraptors
[09:02:19] <rindolf> BillCriswell: the origin of the "@" sign in English?
[09:02:28] <rindolf> BillCriswell: or where?
[09:02:37] <BillCriswell> rindolf: I gave up on it.
[09:03:27] <BillCriswell> I'll relax and give it a shot in a few minutes.
[09:03:33] <BillCriswell> I get cranky really easily.
[09:03:33] <duch_kazatel> "originally an accounting and commercial invoice abbreviation meaning "at the rate of" (e.g. 7 widgets @ Â£2 = Â£14)"
[09:04:10] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: What I managed to read briefly suggested much earlier than that I'd imagine. Like, middle ages haha.
[09:04:15] <BillCriswell> Then it scrolled up and I left.
[09:04:21] <duch_kazatel> oooh.
[09:04:24] <rindolf> BillCriswell: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign
[09:05:31] <BillCriswell> rindolf: Wonder why google didn't show me that off the bat.
[09:06:03] <rindolf> BillCriswell: I used https://duckduckgo.com/?q=at%20sign
[09:06:14] <duch_kazatel> I did https://www.google.com/#q=%40
[09:06:38] <BillCriswell> I looked up "where did the @ symbol come from?"
[09:06:43] <duch_kazatel> aaaah.
[09:06:47] <BillCriswell> I guess I need to be less specific haha
[09:06:56] <duch_kazatel> google is getting too good for stuff now imo
[09:07:12] <duch_kazatel> you can't ask that because they're tuning for people like me who run inefficient searches
[09:07:30] <duch_kazatel> "this person was unhelpful and gave me a symbol.  They prolly want the wiki page about it."
[09:07:45] <BillCriswell> HAha true.
[09:20:32] <zlude> Hello guys! I need to use something similar to iframe, but I don't want to use that. So I hear about .load function in jquery, to open a content inside a div and it works but don't work like an iframe with scrolls, my content loaded in div with .load function broken my div size. someone can help me?
[09:20:55] <duch_kazatel> zlude .load() uses ajax: it brings that content into your page.
[09:21:06] <duch_kazatel> zlude why don't you want to use an iframe?
[09:22:35] <duch_kazatel> zlude also: what do you want your end result to look like?
[09:45:54] <mootzville> hello all
[09:52:18] <rindolf> mootzville: hi.
[09:52:34] <zlude> duch_kazatel, it's just because i never see never more using iframes
[09:57:37] <skullcrasher> any chance for an ajax file upload compatible to ie8 :/?
[10:04:20] <MikeD_> zlude: how often do you go looking for iframes?
[10:04:37] <MikeD_> you probably don't notice the ones that don't have scrollbars
[10:12:58] <zlude> MikeD_, yeah, haha maybe do have reason... facebook have a lot of iframes
[10:17:17] <drej> a lot = 4
[10:17:21] <drej> for the ads
[10:17:23] <drej> nothing else
[10:17:49] <MikeD_> ads are pretty commonly done in iframe
[10:20:07] <duch_kazatel> zlude iframes are still in use in a lot of plaes.
[10:20:41] <zlude> duch_kazatel, so it's not ugly to use... sure? haha
[10:20:51] <duch_kazatel> it has its place.
[10:21:00] <duch_kazatel> it really depends on what you're doing.
[10:21:03] <MikeD_> use the right tool for the job...
[10:21:06] <duch_kazatel> so... what are you trying to do?
[10:22:22] <duch_kazatel> because if what you''re trying to do is embed an entire other document within another document, iframes are p. good at that.
[10:27:07] <duch_kazatel> jesus christ some people./
[10:27:31] <MikeD_> I've never seen "jesus christ" used as a verb
[10:27:40] <duch_kazatel> i'm a pioneer.
[10:28:01] <cannap> hi i generate some data-menuanchor= with php now i dont know how i can get all of this? not only one
[10:28:05] <cannap> in a array or something
[10:28:10] <duch_kazatel> cannap wut
[10:28:22] <cannap> wait
[10:28:23] <duch_kazatel> cannap if you want the value of that, use .data('menuanchor')
[10:28:33] <MikeD_> i don't think it'll be that easy
[10:29:13] <duch_kazatel> i am so much closer to making my pragmatic programming site.
[10:29:53] <MonkeyBike87> Hi guys
[10:30:13] <MonkeyBike87> Does someone has an answer to the following problem: http://bit.ly/1jIyfGK ?
[10:30:26] <cannap> http://jsfiddle.net/PTqmE/10/
[10:30:42] <duch_kazatel> MonkeyBike87 can you fiddle it?
[10:30:42] <cannap> i only know how i get the first but not all? in a array or something
[10:31:16] <MonkeyBike87> The problem is that I use Grunt with a LESS pre-compiler
[10:31:38] <duch_kazatel> that's fine - the rendered output is all we need.
[10:31:41] <MonkeyBike87> which makes it a bit tricky to "just paste" my CSS / jQuery
[10:31:49] <MonkeyBike87> ok, let me se
[10:31:53] <duch_kazatel> cannap http://jsfiddle.net/PTqmE/13/
[10:33:15] <cannap> ah omg
[10:33:26] <cannap> i look all time for something like .getAll() or so lol
[10:33:27] <cannap> thx
[10:33:30] <Brycetron> Yo anyone wanna help me with my Tic Tac Toe game
[10:33:30] <Brycetron> http://jsfiddle.net/7ewrt/84/
[10:33:35] <Brycetron> Trying to finish it today
[10:33:37] <duch_kazatel> :)
[10:33:50] <Brycetron> it'd be much appreciated
[10:34:04] <duch_kazatel> MonkeyBike87 your LESS is the same as the comperable SASS
[10:34:55] <duch_kazatel> MonkeyBike87 http://jsfiddle.net/B5yxp/
[10:35:30] <duch_kazatel> MonkeyBike87 you need to run your shrink logic on pageload, as well.
[10:36:49] <Brycetron> any1 want to help me w/ my tic tac toe game
[10:36:50] <Brycetron> http://jsfiddle.net/7ewrt/84/
[10:36:53] <Brycetron> duch gave up helping me
[10:36:56] <Brycetron> so i'm stuck on my own
[10:37:27] <Brycetron> it'd be much appreciated
[10:41:15] <rindolf> Brycetron: hi.
[10:41:24] <Brycetron> Hey man
[10:41:57] <duch_kazatel> I'm working through an issue where Akamai's Blaze screws with our page and causes document ready to fire before it's actually ready.  This caused one script to throw a fit because it needed said data.
[10:42:08] <rindolf> Brycetron: what's the symptoms of the problem?
[10:42:27] <Brycetron> Basically, Duch left off, telling me to find on my own how to compare the array so I dunno
[10:42:32] <Brycetron> He was helping me the whole time throughout the tic tac toe game
[10:42:40] <MikeD_> fwiw - if duch gave up on you, there was probably a good reason  :)
[10:42:47] <Brycetron> Now he won't help me , he said he's too busy at work
[10:42:52] <Brycetron> But apparently that doesn't seem to be the issue.
[10:42:58] <Brycetron> So I dunno, ask Duch
[10:43:03] <MikeD_> oh, i was just rattling your cage
[10:43:13] <duch_kazatel> Brycetron i tried to tell you to explore and learn on your own :) you kept asking for me to make the solution for you.
[10:43:34] <duch_kazatel> for the record - I'm helping him build an overengineered tic tac toe game
[10:43:39] <Brycetron> ^^
[10:43:44] <Brycetron> So overengineered is the key word
[10:43:50] <Brycetron> That's why I was asking for help
[10:43:55] <Brycetron> I am not as experienced as you are Duch
[10:44:07] <Brycetron> It doesn't hurt to give me an answer every now and then
[10:44:09] <MikeD_> I believe that was well-covered by the AI documentary: Wargames.
[10:44:10] <duch_kazatel> in his current step, he needs to compare the three values to one another in an array.
[10:44:16] <Brycetron> Secondly, now that you won't help me, surely, i won't learn what i needed to do right?
[10:44:17] <MonkeyBike87> duch_kazatel: I pasted it in the bin. Have a look please.
[10:44:19] <Brycetron> So ... that defeats the whole purpose
[10:44:20] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_++
[10:44:52] <gnarf> Brycetron: um hey - guilt trip much?
[10:44:54] <duch_kazatel> Brycetron not really - you need to learn to explore and experiment a little better.  that's all.
[10:45:11] <Brycetron> Yea since I wasn't right?
[10:45:13] <gnarf> Brycetron: try asking questions - "help me with..." doesn't mean anything
[10:45:19] <Brycetron> I asked questions
[10:45:24] <fels_zh> got a wierd issue on mobile web on safari - it shows the html in odd positions on first load then if I click on page it seems to be ok
[10:45:25] <Brycetron> His answers were i don't have time today
[10:45:27] <Brycetron> find out on your own
[10:45:37] <gnarf> Brycetron: there are 700 people in this channel
[10:45:39] <duch_kazatel> you kept asking me to do it for you for you to "learn"
[10:45:45] <Brycetron> Yea that's what i wantede
[10:45:49] <Brycetron> just do the whole tic tac tioe game for me
[10:45:53] <Brycetron> just complete it
[10:45:56] <Brycetron> and i'll be so much smarter
[10:46:06] <Brycetron> I'll be back in a few hours to see that you finished it
[10:46:07] <Brycetron> Thanks duch
[10:46:08] <gnarf> someone else can help... why don't you ask a specific question, not "can someone help me"
[10:46:10] <Brycetron> lol... jk but srsly
[10:46:16] <Brycetron> ridiculous
[10:46:24] <gnarf> `ask
[10:46:24] <b-ot> gnarf: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:46:27] <Brycetron> btw it'd take duch 5 minutes to finish it
[10:46:35] <fels_zh> got a wierd issue on mobile web on safari - it shows the html in odd positions on first load then if I click on page it seems to be ok -- any ideas ?
[10:46:37] <gnarf> so?
[10:47:01] <gnarf> Brycetron: the point is that you understand whats happening, not that duch_kazatel can implement something for you on his companies time
[10:47:01] <Brycetron> So if he acutally cared like he says he does, why would he just give up on me
[10:47:03] <Brycetron> all together?
[10:47:14] <gnarf> if he had the time, he'd probably love to help
[10:47:23] <duch_kazatel> i really made an enemy apaprently.  i spent a few weeks - hours each day trying to walk him through this.  little bits of homework to try to experiment.
[10:47:31] <Brycetron> Yea Duch
[10:47:33] <Brycetron> Thanks for that
[10:48:03] <Brycetron> But if the stupid game isn't finished, there is no point for me to of even started something that is impossible for me to finish
[10:48:07] <Brycetron> YOu said it yourself, overengineerd
[10:48:11] <Brycetron> now that you won't help me, i'm screwred.
[10:48:20] <gnarf> Brycetron: okay, ask a question, or stop guilting duch_kazatel please
[10:48:27] <MikeD_> Brycetron: are you a programmer?
[10:48:33] <MonkeyBike87> http://jsfiddle.net/PTqmE/19/
[10:48:34] <duch_kazatel> he's trying to learn.
[10:48:53] <MikeD_> i'd argue not 'trying' very hard.
[10:49:01] <Brycetron> MikeD what woudl you suggset I do?
[10:49:03] <duch_kazatel> Brycetron what's the current step you're on?
[10:49:12] <Brycetron> Current step is making that code less Hairy as you said
[10:49:16] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[10:49:20] <Brycetron> Lol i have the logs
[10:49:21] <Brycetron> Don't lie
[10:49:26] <duch_kazatel> the current step was to figure out how to compare the three values in an array.
[10:49:34] <gnarf> Brycetron: you should say "I want this thing to do ______, but instead, when i tried _____ it didn't do that, it did ______ - anyone got an idea?"
[10:49:41] <Brycetron> The whole reason though, is to make the code less hairy... before we had a perfectly working code, am i right?
[10:50:06] <duch_kazatel> sure - i was trying to teach you other concepts.
[10:50:21] <Brycetron> And you telling me to go google it
[10:50:29] <Brycetron> isn't the nicest thing you could have done, or the most "helpful" thing
[10:50:29] <duch_kazatel> MonkeyBike87 what is this plugin?
[10:50:31] <MikeD_> gnarf:  i want this thing to do _play tic tac toe_ but instead when i tried to _play_ it didn't do that, it did ___"error"___    <-- like this?
[10:50:31] <Brycetron> I was open to learning
[10:50:35] <gnarf> yes - google is my best friend Brycetron
[10:50:38] <gnarf> learn to google
[10:50:45] <Brycetron> If someone tells you go google it
[10:50:46] <duch_kazatel> and MDN is killer, too.
[10:50:46] <gnarf> i googled 20+ answers already today for my day job
[10:50:48] <Brycetron> It's kind of offensive sometimes
[10:50:51] <Brycetron> It can be
[10:50:53] <duch_kazatel> what is?
[10:50:54] <gnarf> ^ no it isn't
[10:50:59] <MonkeyBike87> duch_kazatel: which plugin?
[10:51:06] <Brycetron> Especially when the person is clearly asking for help like I am doing so
[10:51:11] <Brycetron> Then you get shut down with a "google it"
[10:51:14] <Brycetron> Thanks pal!
[10:51:21] <MikeD_> quit boo-hooing...
[10:51:26] <brunoais> gnarf, 20? only?
[10:51:31] <gnarf> Brycetron: okay last warning - pleasee quit guilt/whining
[10:51:31] <brunoais> I use that all the time
[10:51:40] <gnarf> ints not productive to support
[10:51:51] <Brycetron> Idc i'm leaving
[10:51:53] <Brycetron> Peace out
[10:51:56] <MonkeyBike87> duch_kazatel: The sticky menu is achieved with sticky.js
[10:51:56] <brunoais> o/
[10:52:33] <MonkeyBike87> duch_kazatel: The changing css-class is custom jQuery
[10:52:55] <MonkeyBike87> Basically it works fine
[10:53:16] <MonkeyBike87> The only problem that I get is if I directly load an anchor point
[10:53:55] <MonkeyBike87> In that case it messes up the menu when I scroll to the top
[10:54:18] <MonkeyBike87> Unfortunately, you cannot demonstrate this in the bin
[10:54:41] <duch_kazatel> MonkeyBike87 so you can't separately linkt he plugins in the fiddle instead?
[10:56:03] <MonkeyBike87> duch_kazatel: As i said I use Grunt as a compiler for LESS and Javascript... I pull the libraries in with Bower
[10:56:33] <MonkeyBike87> duch_kazetel: You find the part that relates to the changing CSS-classes in the html-box at the bottom
[10:56:47] <duch_kazatel> hrm.  it'd be nice if you could link them separately.  either way the code in your original SO post shows me you're not checking for the opposite case.
[10:56:57] <duch_kazatel> you're handling greater than or equal to, but not less than.
[10:57:07] <duch_kazatel> i'd wonder if that's part of the issue.
[10:57:16] <MonkeyBike87> duch_kasatel: Have a look at   <!-- change service-nav -->
[10:58:26] <duch_kazatel> woah
[10:58:32] <StephenS> woah
[10:58:39] <TheEternalAbyss> woah?
[10:58:46] <duch_kazatel> joey lawrence up in hurr
[10:59:51] <duch_kazatel> MonkeyBike87 yeah i'm convinced it's this part: if (scroll >= 650) {
[11:00:10] <duch_kazatel> hard to help when i can't play with a working version though =/
[11:01:15] <TheEternalAbyss> www.pastebin.com/MHwJiNJy    <-- so I have a question. I'm trying to pass a parameter through this jquery plugin to a php program and it keeps not liking what I'm doing. How would I format that so it'll work?
[11:01:19] <MonkeyBike87> duch_kazatel: Ok, I thought that it is related to that part... If you think it through, jQuery assumes that the page is loaded at the top and not at an anchor point...
[11:01:44] <duch_kazatel> MonkeyBike87 like I said, you probably need to handle the opposite case - the "less than" if you well.
[11:01:47] <duch_kazatel> *will
[11:02:40] <MonkeyBike87> duch_kazatel: Just trying that... Thanks in any case...
[11:02:58] <Inazad> Hi there, I want to know what is called an icon who is always visible and scoll the page when I scroll. When I click on it, I can have access to a form to send an email or help. how do we call this ?&
[11:03:04] <MikeD_> i have an array of objects - is there a simple way to find out if a property of one of those objects matches some value?
[11:03:14] <TheEternalAbyss> is my defining GID outside the function the problem?
[11:03:26] <TheEternalAbyss> hmm yea I think I scoped that wrong
[11:03:40] <duch_kazatel> Inazad you want a fixed position icon.
[11:03:47] <TheEternalAbyss> no...that is inside the function..
[11:04:03] <duch_kazatel> TheEternalAbyss what's the specific error?
[11:04:18] <TheEternalAbyss> it's saying GID is undefined
[11:04:46] <duch_kazatel> TheEternalAbyss the one defined at the top?
[11:04:59] <TheEternalAbyss> before that though it's saying Reference Error: cc is undefined (cc is my username for this program)
[11:05:07] <TheEternalAbyss> yes
[11:05:15] <duch_kazatel> and console.log(GID); isn't throwing an error?
[11:05:19] <duch_kazatel> or is it?
[11:05:28] <TheEternalAbyss> console.log(GID) is saying undefined
[11:05:54] <duch_kazatel> then it looks like <?php echo $_SERVER[HTTP_IV_USER]; ?>; is your problem.
[11:06:22] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ like, search the whole array to see if any object has a given prop?
[11:06:40] <TheEternalAbyss> yea...  keeps saying GID is undefined. How can I assign that request to GID?
[11:07:04] <TheEternalAbyss> well the results of that request. I thought that's how you assigned php variable values to javascript
[11:07:07] <duch_kazatel> TheEternalAbyss wait are you outputting this via php?  or is this just in a JS file without being preprocessed in any way.
[11:07:43] <TheEternalAbyss> it's being processed on page load along with other php and html, but that specific chunk of JS is before the main body in the head
[11:08:00] <TheEternalAbyss> in $(document).ready
[11:08:10] <duch_kazatel> so when you view page source, GID is set to a value?
[11:08:40] <duch_kazatel> what happens if you do it in $(window).on('load' instead?
[11:09:48] <TheEternalAbyss> I don't think it gets set because it's undefined.
[11:09:53] <duch_kazatel> and back to my question from a while ago - I'm working through an issue where Akamai's Blaze screws with our page and causes document ready to fire before it's actually ready.  This caused one script to throw a fit because it needed said data.  while working through the actual problem, I'm wondering if something like this seems sane: http://jsfiddle.net/k4EJ9/1/
[11:10:13] <duch_kazatel> TheEternalAbyss have you search through the rendered page source using chrome's dev tools?
[11:10:21] <TheEternalAbyss> i'm in FF
[11:10:30] <duch_kazatel> or FF's dev tools?
[11:10:35] <Brycetron> Duch you still won't help me?
[11:11:06] <TheEternalAbyss> I can't even find GID in my source
[11:11:32] <duch_kazatel> TheEternalAbyss there's your answer :) i'd dump through your PHP to make sure it's actually getting output.
[11:13:04] <duch_kazatel> TheEternalAbyss is that getting defined from an ajax call?
[11:13:50] <TheEternalAbyss> not GID itself no. I need it defined before an ajax call
[11:14:42] <duch_kazatel> interesting.  wonder what the deal is.
[11:16:19] <TheEternalAbyss> wait...
[11:16:31] <TheEternalAbyss> is the output is a string
[11:16:38] <TheEternalAbyss> fromt he php request..
[11:16:50] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[11:17:58] <TheEternalAbyss> should I be doing var GID = "<? echo $_SERVER[HTTP_IV_USER]; ?>" ;     something like that?
[11:18:29] <Intii> Hi guys can anyone help me out with fancybox? For some reason it's not working on my site when I click the video thumbnail button. http://livebeverage.com/
[11:19:04] <TheEternalAbyss> Intii: do you get an error in your console?
[11:19:10] <Intii> Nope no errors
[11:19:13] <Intii> That's the problem
[11:19:20] <Intii> I don't know how/what to debug
[11:19:22] <TheEternalAbyss> you have mootools?
[11:19:27] <Intii> Nope
[11:19:40] <duch_kazatel> wat
[11:19:50] <duch_kazatel> TheEternalAbyss i don't know anything about PHP so I'm not sure how you output things.
[11:20:07] <duch_kazatel> Intii we used fancybox and then changed to jqmodal.
[11:20:11] <TheEternalAbyss> well I'm right in the middle of debugging something. I can take a look in a min since I've played with fancybox before. it can be picky about things
[11:20:27] <TheEternalAbyss> duch_kazatel: k thanks, i can ask in #PHP :)
[11:20:46] <drej> you can try :)
[11:21:15] <Intii> TheEternalAbyss: okay
[11:21:26] <Intii> if you can that'd be awesome. all its supposed todo is load up a viemo video
[11:21:49] <duch_kazatel> Intii where's your code setup?
[11:21:56] <Intii> What do you mean?
[11:22:00] <Intii> Like the actual JS?
[11:22:07] <duch_kazatel> oh it's on page.
[11:22:55] <duch_kazatel> you'll want to put that code into a separate js file and link that instead.
[11:23:11] <Intii> Okay, I'll do that right now
[11:23:22] <duch_kazatel> that won't fix the problem, but it's a great first step.
[11:24:10] <Intii> that part is done!
[11:24:50] <duch_kazatel> <a class="iframe" href="http://www.example">This goes to iframe</a> - you'll want to do something like this intead.
[11:25:06] <duch_kazatel> basically, read the docs.
[11:25:22] <duch_kazatel> iirc you have to fire manually and tell it to launch an iframe instead.
[11:26:07] <duch_kazatel> and the body of that iframe should be the embedded version of the vimeo video.
[11:26:17] <Intii> Hmm...okay
[11:26:33] <Intii> I was reading the docs and there is an example for a viemo video the way I did it
[11:26:43] <Intii> I literally just copy/pasted the code into my own project
[11:27:07] <duch_kazatel> mind linking that?
[11:28:08] <Intii> Wait...I think I might have missed something -_-
[11:28:29] <duch_kazatel> :)
[11:29:50] <Intii> God damn it. It's definitely time for me to go home
[11:30:15] <duch_kazatel> missed a little there?
[11:30:17] <Intii> Thank you guys!
[11:30:23] <Intii> Yeah I didn't include the media helper
[11:30:37] <duch_kazatel> it's always something simple.
[11:31:21] <Intii> That's the problem rofl
[11:31:24] <Intii> Hard stuff is easier to fix
[11:31:55] <duch_kazatel> right?  every time i find a small, simple solution to something, I'm always like "that cannot be the real solution.
[11:32:22] <Intii> Exactly!
[11:34:00] <duch_kazatel> "out-dumb the javascript - that's really what you want to do."
[11:34:08] <duch_kazatel> i just had that conversation with somebody.
[11:34:22] <hactor> Wait why would JSON be html encoded.
[11:34:36] <duch_kazatel> hactor in what case?
[11:34:46] <Intii> lmfaooo that's the smartest thing i've ever heard
[11:35:26] <hactor> duch_kazatel, I had a keyboard mishap, wrong chan.
[11:35:34] <duch_kazatel> hah good times :)
[11:42:06] <BillCriswell> Slow day today.
[11:42:15] <drej> you're telling me
[11:42:22] <drej> i drank 2 pints at lunch and now im fighting off a coma
[11:42:23] <drej> its a losing battle
[11:42:34] <duch_kazatel> Rob Ford the Movie trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUY6lDja-DE
[11:42:45] <drej> is that the chris farley one duch_kazatel  ?
[11:42:52] <BillCriswell> drej: 2 is never a good idea.
[11:42:55] <duch_kazatel> drej yes
[11:42:59] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha.
[11:43:02] <duch_kazatel> 2 drink minimum imo
[11:43:02] <drej> its really well done
[11:43:08] <tw2113> i was expecting a video of a train wreck
[11:43:44] <duch_kazatel> tw2113 I literally laughed out loud
[11:44:46] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: That's snooze town.
[11:45:19] <BillCriswell> If I sit after two good beers in the middle of the day I'll fall asleep.
[11:46:06] <duch_kazatel> i do some of my best work after 2.  even better if they're a good porter.
[11:46:37] <BillCriswell> 2 probably wouldn't give me any kind of buzz unless I pounded them.
[11:46:49] <drej> i dont drink often
[11:46:54] <drej> im not drunk, im just sleepy
[11:47:03] <BillCriswell> That Ballmer peak is VERY pointy.
[11:47:22] <duch_kazatel> yeah to have to ride that link very carefully.
[11:47:29] <duch_kazatel> what'd you have drej?
[11:47:31] <BillCriswell> drej: Exactly. It's nothing to do with drunk, just makes me sleepy if I have too few instead of that like.. pick me up.
[11:47:49] <drej> you mean what kind of beer did i have ?
[11:47:53] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[11:47:58] <drej> just stella
[11:48:11] <drej> but i also ate an oily cheesy bacony sandwich concoction
[11:48:12] <drej> which doesnt help
[11:48:17] <duch_kazatel> not bad.  i'
[11:48:31] <duch_kazatel> err, -i'
[11:49:10] <BillCriswell> I kicked the keg of Founders Centennial last Friday at the bar.
[11:49:14] <BillCriswell> That was a good night.
[11:50:21] <duch_kazatel> lucky.  i've wnated to try that for a while.
[11:50:38] <BillCriswell> They have it pretty often where I go.
[11:51:06] <duch_kazatel> you're east coast - us westerners aren't as lucky.  especially stuff outta places like michigan.
[11:51:30] <dwarder> what to use to debug websockets in linux? i don't see this feature not in chrome, chromium of firefox, i only seen this feature in canary chrome on windows
[11:51:58] <duch_kazatel> chromium of firefox?  huh?
[11:52:20] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Ahh.
[11:52:36] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Bear Republic is very popular here.
[11:52:50] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: huh?!
[11:52:53] <BillCriswell> Racer 5 is my 2nd in line.
[11:52:55] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell good.  those guys are way solid.  they're a little north of us.
[11:53:07] <duch_kazatel> i just had the cafe racer 15 the other night.  really good stuff.
[11:53:18] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: what huh?
[11:53:21] <duch_kazatel> dwarder check out Wireshark or a similar network monitoring type application.
[11:53:30] <dwarder> :(
[11:53:38] <BillCriswell> Haven't heard of that one. I did enjoy the Racer X though
[11:53:39] <ophi491_> is there a way im supposed to do parsing json better or easier -  http://jsfiddle.net/v8gvD/
[11:54:08] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell it's a DIPA version of Racer 5 iirc.
[11:54:15] <duch_kazatel> ophi491_ no need to use .each()
[11:54:22] <duch_kazatel> ophi491_ but you've got the basic idea there.
[11:54:35] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Looking at their beers now. There's so many I have to try.
[11:55:09] <ophi491_> duch_kazatel what can i use instead?
[11:55:14] <duch_kazatel> ophi491_ for
[11:55:37] <duch_kazatel> ophi491_ for (var prop in object), where prop is how you want to refer to each property, and object is the name of your object.
[11:56:21] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell they're about 4 hours away fromme.
[11:56:24] <duch_kazatel> *from me
[11:56:36] <duch_kazatel> down in the bay.
[11:57:18] <ophi491_> duck_kazatel does that only specify one property to search for?
[11:57:28] <ophi491_> lol
[11:57:33] <ophi491_> duch_kazatel*
[11:57:35] <duch_kazatel> ophi491_ nope.
[11:58:18] <duch_kazatel> ophi491_ that does your first level.  is your sample data structure indicative of your final result?
[11:58:40] <duch_kazatel> actually that'd be your second level, first one just needs to be iterated.
[11:59:14] <ophi491_> duch_kazatel yes it is
[12:00:20] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/v8gvD/1/ for the version that doesn't need jquery.
[12:00:53] <duch_kazatel> even better - what browsers do you need to support?
[12:02:27] <ophi491_> wow that is much easier
[12:02:36] <duch_kazatel> it gets better :)
[12:02:42] <ophi491_> right now im just doing a chrome extension
[12:03:25] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/v8gvD/2/
[12:04:14] <duch_kazatel> no jquery needed :)
[12:04:39] <ophi491_> very nice thank you
[12:04:52] <duch_kazatel> make sense?
[12:05:12] <ophi491_> it will be much easier to store it to that chrome storage as well now, if that is any good
[12:05:17] <ophi491_> yeah
[12:05:47] <ophi491_> would that not work in other browsers?
[12:05:58] <duch_kazatel> forEach isn't supported in IE 8 and below.
[12:09:07] <dwarder> which verstion of google chrome supports websocket debugging?
[12:09:45] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5751495/debugging-websocket-in-google-chrome
[12:09:51] <duch_kazatel> look like it's been there for a while.
[12:35:21] <ophi491_> has anyone used google chrome's chrome.storage when making an extension
[12:39:13] <_rgn> #chromium-extensions
[12:50:50] <kashi> Can i get unblock youtube videos through simple proxy script. if i will use json method
[12:51:58] <kashi> anyone know about somple proxy and youtube api
[12:52:22] <duch_kazatel> kashi you have to hit their site through a proxy.
[12:52:27] <duch_kazatel> getting the video source isn't enough.
[12:52:51] <kashi> duch how can?
[12:53:09] <duch_kazatel> by using a proxy.
[12:53:17] <kashi> can you little bit bregf me
[12:53:22] <duch_kazatel> bregf?
[12:53:25] <kashi> simple proxy
[12:53:39] <duch_kazatel> kashi you have to route everything to/from youtube through a proxy.  search google for more info.
[13:00:01] <MikeD_> http://jsfiddle.net/UL9rm/  is there much reason to use one or the other in this example?
[13:00:57] <duch_kazatel> delegated over none?
[13:01:01] <duch_kazatel> *non
[13:01:09] <MikeD_> yes
[13:01:29] <duch_kazatel> depends one where you want your overhead and the page in question.
[13:02:07] <MikeD_> the real page is almost as basic/simple a use-case
[13:02:08] <duch_kazatel> i tend to favor delevation simply because the events are going to bubble either way, and I can bind things without worrying if the markup is going to change.  i can also bind fewer listeners.
[13:02:42] <duch_kazatel> but listening to events as they bubble comes with a small cost - binding directly is more expensive when doing the binding, but saves you on the listening side.
[13:04:28] <MikeD_> hmm... those are definitely the concerns I had.  :p
[13:04:46] <duch_kazatel> also - if ajax is involved, delegate.
[13:04:47] <MikeD_> why can't you just make up my mind?
[13:05:19] <duch_kazatel> :) what's your particular use case this time around?
[13:05:19] <MikeD_> to hell with the small costs, i'm using the notation i like to read better: delegated events
[13:05:25] <duch_kazatel> ++
[13:05:35] <duch_kazatel> when in doubt, delegate (imo)
[13:05:58] <MikeD_> that's as good a rule as any
[13:06:25] <duch_kazatel> just so long as you're aware of the tradeoff :)
[13:08:59] <ortix_> is there a plugin/tutorial/documentation on how to animate a collection of images so that they grow from nothing to a specific size, 1 by 1, to fill up a container
[13:09:16] <ortix_> like a bunch of bubbles popping into existence 1 by 1 and then row by row
[13:09:21] <duch_kazatel> nope, but that should be pretty easy.
[13:09:44] <duch_kazatel> at least, everything but knowing where to put them is trivial.
[13:11:06] <ortix_> well i could just sit and read the documentation of .animate()
[13:11:17] <ortix_> but i figured if there is a tutorial or example, i'd just use that
[13:11:24] <ortix_> why reinvent the wheel ;)
[13:11:38] <duch_kazatel> eh, that's a specific enough case imo.
[13:12:25] <ortix_> i'm pretty sure it has been done before haha but fair enough
[13:12:49] <duch_kazatel> nah my point is more of "that's a specific enough use-case that there might not be a tutorial for it"
[13:14:31] <ortix_> ah ok, then let me ask a bit of a more specific question
[13:14:43] <Brycetron> Duche_kazatel@
[13:14:46] <Brycetron> can hyou help me plz
[13:14:55] <Brycetron> duch*
[13:15:21] <ortix_> each element has to start hidden, should I add style="display:none" or add a class for that
[13:15:33] <duch_kazatel> ortix_ i'd do a class.
[13:16:06] <ortix_> duch_kazatel: the thing is that when i remove the class to unhide it, it just pops up and I can't seem to fade/slide
[13:16:08] <duch_kazatel> ortix_ you should generally avoid doing inline styles.
[13:16:22] <duch_kazatel> ortix_ right - want to then animate the effect you want.
[13:16:28] <duch_kazatel> your default state is "hidden"
[13:16:49] <duch_kazatel> Brycetron sure.  feel free to pm and we can see what you've got :)
[13:22:36] <maxbit890> hy
[13:23:04] <thebope> duch_kazatel, how do you find the time to help so many people so diligently, patiently, and often?
[13:23:34] <thebope> It's very impressive and admirable
[13:23:42] <duch_kazatel> thebope I do a great job with context switching.
[13:24:01] <thebope> It's pretty sweet, you must be a helluva developer
[13:24:17] <thebope> Assuming that's your positional title
[13:24:17] <duch_kazatel> :) i simply believe in the idea that helping others is apart of what we do.
[13:24:30] <thebope> Its a learning experience for your self as well generally
[13:24:32] <duch_kazatel> yep - software developer.  soon to be senior software developer
[13:24:35] <duch_kazatel> and exactly.
[13:24:48] <duch_kazatel> right now i'm dealing with some pretty mind-numbing project.
[13:24:58] <duch_kazatel> the mental gymnastics keep me going sometimes.
[13:25:11] <duch_kazatel> but i appreciate the kind words.
[13:25:12] <MikeD_> i help 10 people with simple (to me) problems so i've paid my dues (so to speak) for when I have a question i really need help with.
[13:25:23] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ that, too.
[13:26:00] <thebope> I try to help when I can, but this is my first year developing, I'm about 6 months in, and I'm not that qualified in jquery yet
[13:26:02] <duch_kazatel> every once in a while, I have a question.
[13:26:09] <duch_kazatel> you'll get there :)
[13:26:12] <thebope> once the semester ends I'd like to read the jQuery docs through and through
[13:26:33] <duch_kazatel> the api docs are pretty good.  don't neglect the other libs.  learn what makes jquery great vs, say, mootools.
[13:26:55] <thebope> sweet, thats good advice
[13:26:57] <duch_kazatel> and what mootools does well vs jQuery.
[13:27:13] <thebope> You know I'd never heard of mootools?
[13:27:21] <duch_kazatel> hah, there's a reason for that ;)
[13:27:39] <thebope> My first thought is it must be a cow of a library ;-)
[13:27:55] <duch_kazatel> it's like being a guitarist - you can be a pretty good jazz player if you just study jazz.  it's when you start exploring other styles that you unlock the real mastery.
[13:28:06] <duch_kazatel> there's also YUI
[13:29:07] <snover> duch_kazatel: comparing libraries in that manner is wrong; one must look at the libraries and compare how well they compare when trying to accomplish what you are trying to accomplish. jQuery is a great choice for doing ad-hoc DOM manipulation but a terrible choice for authoring a complex RIA
[13:29:29] <maxbit890> ^^ can some one help me with i mean a little problem but it semms to be pretty messedup if i have a $.ajax({} request with post and dataType json and a json string attached that looks like: "data="+json.stringify(myobject) i get a problem if my object has a string with a & symbol how do i go for it that my data variable is posted as one dataset?
[13:29:42] <duch_kazatel> snover that's why I I said "learn what makes jquery great vs, say, mootools." and then "and what mootools does well vs jQuery."
[13:31:08] <duch_kazatel> snover not all libraries are appropriate for all situations.
[13:31:59] <snover> duch_kazatel: ok, it sounded more like you were saying to compare the feature sets directly and then decide which is better based on that metric
[13:32:16] <duch_kazatel> oh, no.  sorry, i can see where you'd get that impression.
[13:39:05] <ortix_> duch_kazatel: ok i got it to work, but animating width turns out to be problematic due to bootstrap responsiveness
[13:39:52] <ortix_> do you tihnk there is a way to animate "away" the class which has width:0 and height:auto
[13:41:29] <ortix_> what I'm basically doing is, i set every element to 0 width and auto height. Then animate each element to a specific width, but that fixes the width
[13:43:14] <MikeD_> before you start messing around with it, set the height value on the element so you can animate up to that value
[13:43:25] <MikeD_> or width
[13:44:15] <Orbiter> What causes the horizontal "chopping" motion in IE? http://dropthebit.com/demos/fancy_input/fancyInput.html
[13:50:01] <gnarf> duch_kazatel thebope : though might as well mention dojo too ;) I'd point someone there before YUI or moo anyday
[13:50:19] <thebope> gnarf, thanks I'm going to write all these down
[13:54:40] <BillCriswell> Let's assume there's 3 <article> elements. var $articles = $('article'); $articles.last().remove(); Is there a property in jQuery that'll allow me to get 2 here instead of 3 which .length returns?
[13:55:34] <BillCriswell> Did .size() used to do that? I know it's deprecated.
[13:55:37] <oniMaker> This is a longshot, but has anyone ever worked with parsley 1.x ? For some reason the onFieldValidate, onFieldError, onFieldSuccess events all fire fine, but the onFormValidate event never fires.
[13:59:05] <thebope> BillCriswell, you want to remove the second article?
[13:59:21] <duch_kazatel> gnarf hahaha that's awesome.
[13:59:45] <BillCriswell> thebope: No, I just want the length to keep up with how many elements are in the collection.
[14:00:15] <thebope> BillCriswell, ahh, hmm
[14:00:43] <BillCriswell> I know I could be dangerous as do $articles.length-- but I was wondering if there was a right way.
[14:00:55] <gnarf> oniMaker: sounds like the kind of thing a fiddle might help us understand
[14:01:06] <thebope> You could have an index you update everytime you call the remove function, and then subtract that instead
[14:01:10] <thebope> But that's a pain
[14:01:16] <thebope> and probably not optimal
[14:01:29] <StephenS> jQuery
[14:02:11] <BillCriswell> thebope: Yeah, I currently get the collection on click and remove 1 so I can just check if the length is 1 instead of 0 in this case. I was just wondering if there was a right way.
[14:02:22] <oniMaker> gnarf: maybe, but I'd rather not dig into an outdated version of their lib... using it since this theme uses it, but the real solution (worth spending any time on) would be to upgrade it to their 2.x release
[14:02:28] <oniMaker> gnarf: for now I think I can hack around it
[14:02:54] <thebope> BillCriswell, I wish I knew
[14:03:34] <BillCriswell> thebope: I'm sure there's a good reason for it.
[14:03:36] <gnarf> BillCriswell whats happening?
[14:03:44] <gnarf> wait re-reading now
[14:03:51] <gnarf> okay
[14:03:51] <gnarf> so
[14:03:56] <BillCriswell> gnarf: Just removing items from a collection and getting the current size.
[14:04:33] <gnarf> $articles = $('article') again -- or even $articles = $articles.not($articles.last().remove())
[14:05:21] <BillCriswell> gnarf: Aha
[14:05:26] <gnarf> i actually prefer the former
[14:05:34] <gnarf> because the later builds up a pretty big "stack"
[14:06:17] <gnarf> i.e. you could .end() a bunch of times, and its wasting references to long dead articles
[14:06:55] <gnarf> you can just regenerate the collection or you can stop the "chain" by doing $articles = jQuery( $articles.not( $articles.last().remove() ) );
[14:07:31] <BillCriswell> Damn, so many ways to approach that haha.
[14:08:05] <BillCriswell> The more I'm thinking about it the more I'm realizing expecting length to update is just plain wrong.
[14:08:35] <thebope> I like that latter option in the first line gnarf , creative
[14:09:06] <thebope> are jquery stacks very expensive? i know compared to say, traditional javascript methods they're already expensive
[14:09:31] <gnarf> thebope: not "expensive" just that you retain references to all the old elements so they can never be collected
[14:09:47] <thebope> ahh that makes sense
[14:10:08] <thebope> Anyone have any best practice jquery book recommendations?
[14:10:16] <BillCriswell> gnarf: Thanks for the approaches.
[14:10:18] <thebope> I've got a bit of a reading list this summer, but maybe I can squeeze one more in
[14:10:28] <gnarf> BillCriswell: no problem
[14:10:37] <BillCriswell> Home time. Have a good weekend everyone!
[14:10:40] <gnarf> thebope: nope sorry, I haven't written one yet ;)
[14:10:47] <thebope> gnarf,  :-)
[14:10:50] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[14:10:54] <duch_kazatel> gnarf++
[14:11:01] <gnarf> even if i did, it'd be out of date by the time it published
[14:11:07] <thebope> This is true isn't it?
[14:11:18] <gnarf> but basically best practice is a changing thing
[14:11:33] <gnarf> mostly just stick to general js best practices and you'll be good
[14:11:54] <thebope> okay sweet, I've got a book on that already
[14:13:39] <gnarf> thebope: not sure where you are, but there is always http://events.jquery.org/2014/chicago/
[14:14:08] <thebope> ahh wow, I'm in NYC
[14:14:22] <thebope> thats a nice picture of chi town they took
[14:17:51] <thebope> I wonder if I can convince my employer to pay for a conference in chicago
[14:18:06] <systemfault> It really depends on the companyâ¦
[14:18:26] <duch_kazatel> my company offers to pay.
[14:19:18] <thebope> I think they would, although they'd probably be more amenable to conferences closer to home
[14:19:24] <thebope> It's not as if I'm in a small town here in NYC
[14:19:47] <systemfault> thebope: Traveling in the US is cheap..
[14:19:54] <thebope> this is true as well
[14:19:58] <thebope> and I very much enjoy traveling
[14:20:06] <thebope> I never sleep better than on a plane it seems like
[14:20:16] <systemfault> thebope: I envy you.
[14:20:28] <systemfault> Plane is a nightmare for me.
[14:20:31] <duch_kazatel> same here.
[14:20:32] <thebope> really?
[14:20:37] <thebope> Oh man, I love them
[14:20:48] <thebope> The views, and my pure fascination with those engines
[14:20:59] <thebope> I like being in cars a lot too, although that scares me a lot more often
[14:21:38] <joobie> hey guys.. i have a block of HTML that i want to pass to PHP via GET requests - how can i do this?
[14:21:48] <joobie> not sure if i need to serialize the data or something
[14:21:51] <joobie> to pass it over
[14:22:12] <joobie> dont want to use JSON or anything as it's just HTML markup, want the whole markup sent
[14:22:13] <joobie> any ideas?
[14:22:59] <duch_kazatel> do it via a post.
[14:23:01] <duch_kazatel> not a get.
[14:23:03] <systemfault> thebope: The air is so dry, the difference between the seat is âseatingâ and âsleepingâ position is 2 degrees, it messes up my ears, we are squeezed together like sardinesâ¦
[14:23:50] <thebope> systemfault, this is true
[14:23:51] <duch_kazatel> joobie otherwise you're asking for a world of paoin.
[14:24:06] <joobie> duch_kazatel, not an optino
[14:24:16] <joobie> doh
[14:24:30] <duch_kazatel> joobie how much HTML are you trying to send?
[14:24:38] <thebope> joobie, it might be easier to pass the pertinent information necessary to construct your html and build it client side
[14:24:45] <joobie> about 500 chars
[14:25:14] <joobie> I can do this thebope, but don't need to go to that effort if i can just serialize it and pass it for example
[14:25:32] <joobie> i want the HTML as is, so it's a bit of effort to parse each element of the markup
[14:25:34] <duch_kazatel> joobie sending data via a URL like that isn't generally a good idea.
[14:25:45] <joobie> duch_kazatel, why?
[14:26:03] <duch_kazatel> GETs are meant for retrieving data.
[14:26:09] <duch_kazatel> you want to send data instead.
[14:26:25] <duch_kazatel> URLs are a great way to identify a place somebody can get information - that's what they're meant for.
[14:26:42] <duch_kazatel> URLs are a terrible way to ship data because that system was not built with that system in mind.
[14:26:48] <joobie> the problem i have is i want to send this data to another domain (cross-domain)
[14:26:58] <duch_kazatel> do you control the other domain?
[14:27:02] <joobie> so I can't do this as a POST as it breaches cross-domain security
[14:27:04] <joobie> no I don't
[14:27:18] <joobie> I explored adding that header to the HTTP request, not an option
[14:27:26] <joobie> this is why i'm leaning towards sending it as a GET
[14:27:43] <duch_kazatel> could you explain your project and the real problem you're trying to solve at all?
[14:28:32] <joobie> I am on siteA, and want to take the user to siteB via some javascript. When I take the user to siteB, I want to pass some HTML structure that already exists on siteA over to siteB
[14:28:47] <duch_kazatel> okay - whyfor?
[14:29:36] <joobie> it's part of an internal project, i can't change this overall method
[14:29:51] <joobie> ie. i cant make siteB read from a DB to pull this information .. it has to come from a GET/POST request
[14:30:08] <duch_kazatel> do a post then.
[14:31:08] <duch_kazatel> understanding the project would be nice, but i'll assume you can't tell us anything about it ;)
[14:31:25] <joobie> I can't sorry duch_kazatel
[14:31:28] <joobie> I can't post either
[14:31:32] <joobie> say im on siteA
[14:31:44] <joobie> an iframe comes up with a SRC pointing to siteB
[14:32:04] <joobie> hmm sec
[14:32:09] * joobie thinking
[14:33:52] <joobie> OK
[14:33:54] <joobie> duch_kazatel
[14:34:00] <joobie> say i have the html markup in a JS variable
[14:34:28] <joobie> and i want to POST it (not sure if this will be considered cross-domain) but if i do, how would i serialize the data to send via a POST?
[14:34:46] <joobie> dont want to have to json or parse each object of the HTML if possible
[14:35:08] <duch_kazatel> you shouldn't need to - you're doing a POST.  it's a big old string.
[14:35:56] <joobie> ahh
[14:36:21] <joobie> i'll give it a shot duch_kazatel .. ive been playing with a few scenarios to do this and kept hitting cross-domain issues
[14:36:31] <duch_kazatel> are you posting via ajax?
[14:36:35] <joobie> maybe there's a condition i've forgotten and am not mentioning
[14:36:50] <duch_kazatel> there's a lot you're not telling me, so It's hard to suggest a solution :)
[14:36:59] <joobie> yea i know :)
[14:37:03] <joobie> thanks for the help
[14:37:13] <joobie> i'll try what you suggested above and feed back if there's some hurdles i hit
[14:37:26] <joobie> i think i need to revisit the code to have all the constraints fresh in my mind
[14:37:47] <joobie> thanks for the help :)
[14:42:27] <duch_kazatel> https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2014/5/9/incident-response-at-heroku - neat breakdown.  pretty natural, but good ideas.
[14:51:38] <joobie> duch_kazatel, is an AJAX POST to another site considered cross-domain?
[14:51:53] <joobie> ie, user clicks on a button, and that POST's the HTML markup to another domain
[14:52:16] <duch_kazatel> yes.  anything that uses ajax (post, get, etc) to another site/port/protocol is considered cross domain/
[14:52:20] <joobie> I think that is the limitation.. on user press, i want to send the HTML to another domain
[14:52:30] <joobie> that's why I was looking into JSONP which allows it as a GET request
[14:52:33] <joobie> .. but doesnt support POST
[14:52:48] <duch_kazatel> JSONP works around cross-domain
[14:52:54] <joobie> ya, but only for GET
[14:53:08] <duch_kazatel> because there's no such thing as "post" for JSONP.
[14:53:14] <joobie> nod
[14:53:17] <duch_kazatel> but JSONP won't work in your case.
[14:53:27] <joobie> why is that?
[14:53:38] <duch_kazatel> JSONP is initiated from the side you want the data on.
[14:53:38] <joobie> .. because it's bad to send raw html via GET?
[14:54:00] <duch_kazatel> let's turn this around - are you able to include a script tag on the other page?
[14:54:08] <joobie> I can
[14:54:12] <joobie> i have full control of siteB
[14:54:20] <duch_kazatel> okay, then JSONP can work for you.
[14:54:34] <duch_kazatel> JSONP just wraps the data in a function call.
[14:54:59] <duch_kazatel> you include it like normal js in your page.
[14:55:17] <joobie> define a JS var with the HTML, then JSONP on siteB pulls the JS var?
[14:55:36] <joobie> .. i read a bit into JSONP but didn't fully wrap my head around it. I've a basic understanding of it atm..
[14:55:52] <duch_kazatel> okay, here's the general idea.
[14:56:17] <duch_kazatel> you have your code, right?  it's all wrapped in a function that processes the data however you want.
[14:56:25] <joobie> nod
[14:56:41] <duch_kazatel> that function takes just one argument.
[14:57:02] <duch_kazatel> then, after that script, you include a second one.
[14:57:14] <duch_kazatel> this second script is JSON, but with a twist - it's wrapped in a function call.
[14:57:53] <joobie> and I call that function from JSONP?
[14:58:02] <joobie> siteB?
[14:58:30] <duch_kazatel> the JSONP wraps the data in a function call.  so on siteB, you now have two script includes.  the first is the processing logic, and the second is the jsonp call.
[14:58:48] <joobie> OK
[14:59:17] <joobie> duch_kazatel, I need to revisit the basics of JSONP and i'm sure your explaination will make more sense
[14:59:24] <joobie> i'm a little grey still :P
[14:59:28] <joobie> but thanks for taking the time
[15:01:49] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Kg22Z/
[15:01:52] <duch_kazatel> to illustrate.
[15:02:20] <maxbit890> can some one tellme how i get jquerry to send a json object that contains a & caracter as one post var?
[15:02:43] <duch_kazatel> maxbit890 have a fiddle?
[15:02:49] <joobie> thanks duch_kazatel  :)
[15:02:53] <joobie> much appreciated
[15:03:24] <joobie> btw duch_kazatel
[15:03:34] <joobie> do you think JSONP will survive?
[15:03:54] <duch_kazatel> lol huh?
[15:03:58] <joobie> .. given it's cross-domain, do you think browser vendors will push it into what it considers cross-domain and block it ?
[15:04:03] <b-ot> joobie: andblock.it - âº AVAILABLE
[15:04:06] <maxbit890> @duch_kazatel no why?
[15:04:35] <duch_kazatel> joobie browsers can't really distinguish between a javascript call and JSONP call reliably tbh.
[15:04:46] <duch_kazatel> so it should be fine.
[15:04:52] <duch_kazatel> maxbit890 it's hard to understand what you want to do.
[15:04:53] <joobie> "JSONP takes advantage of the fact that browsers do not enforce the same-origin policy on <script> tags"
[15:05:00] <joobie> - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP
[15:05:11] <joobie> if browsers decided to extend same-origin policy on script tags
[15:05:15] <duch_kazatel> right.  because it's just a script.
[15:05:17] <duch_kazatel> they won't.
[15:05:22] <joobie> ahh k
[15:05:24] <duch_kazatel> probably.
[15:05:27] <joobie> hehe
[15:05:30] <joobie> uh oh :P
[15:05:44] <duch_kazatel> there's really no reason to imo.
[15:06:07] <joobie> they consider it important for the security though
[15:06:12] <joobie> as it's applied outside <script>
[15:06:24] <joobie> .. i think <script> has just evolved a step quicker than their security model it sounds
[15:06:31] <duch_kazatel> not in the slightest.
[15:06:38] <duch_kazatel> do you understand what CORS is doing?
[15:06:42] <joobie> ahh k
[15:06:45] <joobie> no
[15:06:50] <duch_kazatel> and what the security problems are it's solving?
[15:06:58] <duch_kazatel> i'd suggest reading about it.
[15:07:00] <maxbit890> @duch_kazatel ok what i have is $.ajax() call thats type is post, its dataType is json and it has a data field that contains "data="+json.stringify(call) call contains 2 strings one of tham contains html code and in that html code it contains a &nbsp; the problem now is that the & ends the var data :S
[15:07:06] <joobie> k i will
[15:07:09] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ maxbit890
[15:07:09] <b-ot> maxbit890: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:07:25] <StephenS> how fb loads images so fast? except it preload a next one..
[15:07:30] <joobie> "Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows many resources (e.g. fonts, javascript, etc.) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside of the domain the resource originated from"
[15:07:53] <duch_kazatel> StephenS it loads only the size/quality you need and they have a CDN.
[15:08:11] <joobie> duch_kazatel, it sounds interseting
[15:08:12] <duch_kazatel> joobie you have a lot of reading to do :)
[15:08:15] <StephenS> yeah I know akamai is very good
[15:08:21] <joobie> hehe
[15:08:23] <StephenS> but they had to do some tricks on server side
[15:08:40] <duch_kazatel> StephenS sure - gzip, proper tuning, etc.
[15:08:49] <duch_kazatel> and raw horsepower.
[15:09:07] <yousaf> can someone help me with this snippet of code please? http://laravel.io/bin/Nm03W
[15:09:32] <duch_kazatel> yousaf sure - what's the question?
[15:13:16] <yousaf> duch_kazatel can I share a slightly more detailed snippet via PM?
[15:13:37] <duch_kazatel> i'd rather you put it in the room.
[15:13:44] <yousaf> http://laravel.io/bin/4BjGd
[15:13:53] <duch_kazatel> what's your  question?
[15:14:31] <maxbit890> @duch_kazatel i din't past but if its to long sry here is my ajax call: http://jsfiddle.net/yXQQZ/ if you need more let me know :)
[15:15:07] <yousaf> line 77 i am trying to inject the URL variable but it looks like the var doesn't make to the page context
[15:15:33] <duch_kazatel> maxbit890 okay - do you need so stringify? the data?
[15:15:40] <thebope> good weekend everybody
[15:16:05] <duch_kazatel> yousaf "inject"?  you mean use that variable?
[15:16:13] <yousaf> yes
[15:16:40] <duch_kazatel> okay, and where is this var coming from?
[15:17:11] <maxbit890> @duch_kazatel no not properly but i thought it's the common way :S how would you do it? data=json.stringify(call)?
[15:17:43] <duch_kazatel> yousaf because looking at the docs, it doesn't look like casper doesn't pass anything to those callbacks.
[15:18:12] <shoky> maxbit890:  data: { data: JSON.stringify(call) }
[15:18:15] <yousaf> that var is defined at the top
[15:18:31] <duch_kazatel> yousaf then you want function success() {
[15:18:39] <duch_kazatel> yousaf don't try to pass it.
[15:19:15] <yousaf> duch_kazatel what do you mean? How else am I going to insert the URL in the field then?
[15:19:18] <duch_kazatel> if that doesn't work, declare that var on line 10.
[15:19:42] <duch_kazatel> scoping :) if the variable exists in a parent scope, you'll read from that scope.
[15:19:50] <duch_kazatel> casper doesn't pass any objects to the handlers.
[15:20:39] <duch_kazatel> not that I can see, anyway.
[15:21:46] <yousaf> duch_kazatel I moved that var to line 10 but no joy
[15:21:52] <yousaf> are you saying this is not doable at all?
[15:22:55] <duch_kazatel> yousaf huh?  no... line 76 - delete "url" so this: function success(url) { becomes function success() {
[15:23:05] <duch_kazatel> don't pass an object into that function.
[15:23:58] <yousaf> duch_kazatel I have tried that you can test here http://ide.casperbox.com/?329107fe-869b-4536-974a-6b5097095e46
[15:26:28] <duch_kazatel> yousaf i don't know capser, but it looked like you were trying to access a variable that didn't exist in that scope.
[15:26:46] <duch_kazatel> is there a channel about casper?
[15:27:15] <duch_kazatel> looks like it - #casper
[15:27:36] <maxbit890> @duch_kazatel thanks i think i have to edit the code on the server side :S thanks so far wish ya a nice time :)
[15:27:52] <duch_kazatel> maxbit890 did you look at what shoky did?
[15:29:59] <maxbit890> @duch_kazatel @shoky a ok i thought it was you ^^ thanks shoky too :) yes it should work but not with the server side script i have now it is a php script that uses $_POST
[15:30:32] <duch_kazatel> maxbit890 no need to prepend with an @ - our clients will notify us if you leave that off :)
[15:30:41] <duch_kazatel> and why are you sending HTML over a POST?
[15:30:45] <duch_kazatel> why not just send data?
[15:34:57] <yousaf> duch_kazatel it looks like i am almost there but getting a different error now http://ide.casperbox.com/?6be6d9cf-18fc-4b91-acc2-6a59540418cb
[15:35:11] <duch_kazatel> yousaf i have no idea what i'm looking at :)
[15:35:27] <yousaf> if you run it, you will see the error :)
[15:35:46] <duch_kazatel> Error: TypeError: 'null' is not an object (evaluating 'document.querySelector('#new_campaign_your_site').value = url') ?
[15:36:37] <yousaf> yes
[15:36:40] <maxbit890> @duch_kazatel couse i d like to pass the content of a tinymce editor to mysql database sofar i did that through php and simple html forms, inline frames, realy old stuff... the only script language that runs on the productive server is php so i wrote some sort of rpc service thats the why the data object is called call

[15:37:44] <yousaf> in what way?
[15:38:05] <duch_kazatel> yousaf if I remove the .value, it doesn't error.
[15:38:17] <duch_kazatel> maxbit890 you mean "production server"?

[15:39:23] <yousaf> as you can tell
[15:39:34] <yousaf> Yes i do know what it should do
[15:39:43] <yousaf> it should basically fill out a form
[15:40:12] <yousaf> and that URL should be inserted in a field
[15:40:44] <duch_kazatel> that's not what i asked :)  your issue is document.querySelector('#new_campaign_your_site').value = url; doesn't work because document.querySelector('#new_campaign_your_site').value is null
[15:41:27] <duch_kazatel> yousaf I'd head over to the capser room and ask there, since this is off topic for #jquery

[15:52:01] <IAAAH> hello, had a question about this: http://sprunge.us/DKZV, in particular the part about "not offering direct manipulation". What exactly does this mean? I should'nt use jquery to... what?, with SVG?
[15:53:12] <IAAAH> ^ thanks for your time; im "new-ish" so jargon-less explanations and links are welcomed.
[16:03:54] <shoky> IAAAH: it means certain manipulations such as .attr or .addClass or others might not work for SVG elements
[16:05:35] <IAAAH> ^ gotcha, thank you

[16:09:13] <BillCriswell> <div class="foo"/><div class="bar"/><div class="baz"/> You can't do $('.foo').next('.baz'), but $('.foo').next('.bar') will... The selector is basically a filter there.

[16:18:21] * rainabba checks if he can find him using irc commands long forgotten to see if others might be able to find him....
[16:18:59] <rainabba> heh. Can't recall the command to check what channels someone is in.
[16:19:11] <tw2113>  /whois $user ?
[16:19:15] <shoky> don't think you can check unless you're on those channels too
[16:19:36] <shoky> oh or maybe that's only for private channels or smth
[16:19:41] <duch_kazatel> resig?  he's over at khan these days isn't he?
[16:19:46] <shoky> yep
[16:20:30] <rainabba> khan?
[16:20:39] <duch_kazatel> https://www.khanacademy.org/
[16:20:50] <rainabba> Ahh. I means here on Freenode but gotcha.
[16:20:56] <rainabba> s/means/meant
[16:21:01] <tw2113> khaaaaaaaaaaaaaan
[16:21:26] <rainabba> I bug him every now and then because I'm trying to make useful contributions to Chrome DevTools since Chrome Dev Summit last year.
[16:22:26] <rainabba> Anyhow, I got some loops to write!
[16:28:46] <rainabba> shoky: You on G+?
[16:28:57] <rainabba> Or active there anyway?
[16:30:13] <shoky> nah not active at all
[16:35:16] <joobie> duch_workbeer, still around ?
[16:35:26] <duch_workbeer> hella.
[16:35:31] <duch_workbeer> have a few in me though
[16:37:08] <BillCriswell> I thought it said "workbear"
[16:37:16] <duch_workbeer> always
[16:43:08] <joobie> duch_workbeer, i looked into that JSONP further - i'm not sure it will work
[16:43:20] <joobie> duch_workbeer, i can put the script tag in on siteB, but the data exists on siteA
[16:43:38] <duch_workbeer> figured ;)
[16:43:40] <joobie> i really need it to work the inverse way.. as i can send a GET via JSONP to siteB
[16:43:54] <duch_workbeer> that's not how JSONP works.
[16:43:57] <joobie> heh
[16:44:01] <joobie> ahh
[16:44:49] <joobie> so how to send this HTML to siteB via web
[16:45:18] <joobie> only way i can think is to use a GET with JSONP.. embed the html content in the GET request sent via <script>
[16:45:30] <joobie> got any other ideas?
[16:45:47] <duch_workbeer> you can't use JSONP in this case.
[16:45:57] <duch_workbeer> without knowing what you're trying to do, i can't really suggest anything.\
[16:47:00] <Woet> joobie: You want to do X, but don't know how. You think you can solve it using Y, but don't know how to do that either. You ask about Y, which is a strange thing to want to do. Just ask about X so we can help you.
[16:47:11] <joobie> i have some HTML on siteA that I want to get to siteB, via JS web requests. I can place JS within siteA (but that's it) and have full control over siteB
[16:47:21] <joobie> that's the goal in a nutshell
[16:47:27] <duch_workbeer> why do you need to do that.
[16:47:43] <joobie> that's the part that I can't go into :P
[16:47:50] <duch_workbeer> and that's why we can't help you.
[16:48:04] <joobie> duch_workbeer, i can't as it's an internal project
[16:48:10] <duch_workbeer> your question is very strange and sounds like you're trying to work around a problem that you don't need to have.
[16:48:16] <joobie> duch_workbeer, but those are the constraints of what i need to achieve
[16:48:39] <shoky> what do you mean by "I can place JS within siteA"
[16:48:42] <joobie> duch_workbeer, I hear you.. I know there are other methods like introducing a DB, etc.. but it's not possible
[16:48:46] <joobie> it's gotta be pure JS web based..
[16:49:07] <duch_workbeer> then you need to go back and tell whoever that the project is not possible with the given constraints.
[16:49:10] <joobie> shoky, i can edit the html files on siteA to put JS in it
[16:49:32] <joobie> .. but that's it, i dont have access to the web server for example or the ability to allow it to trust the siteB domain
[16:49:34] <shoky> but you want the request to be initiated by siteB?
[16:49:37] <joobie> .. via http headers
[16:49:55] <joobie> the request is initiated by siteA, when the user presses a button
[16:50:09] <joobie> then it should grab some HTML on siteA, and send that to siteB
[16:50:10] <duch_workbeer> joobie there's no solution you can provide that will be reliable enough to fulfill the given requirements
[16:50:30] <shoky> if you have js on siteA why can't you send a request to siteB
[16:50:37] <shoky> if you have full control over siteB, that is
[16:50:39] <joobie> shoky, it's cross-domain
[16:50:45] <joobie> shoky, and the browser blocks it
[16:50:51] <shoky> but you say you have full control over the responding side
[16:50:56] <joobie> I do
[16:51:01] <shoky> so you can make it allow cross-domain..
[16:51:05] <duch_workbeer> but not over the server?
[16:51:06] <joobie> but the button is pressed on a page that is served on siteA
[16:51:20] <shoky> so?
[16:51:22] <joobie> so siteA has to implement the allow for the cross-domain
[16:51:27] <shoky> why?
[16:51:35] <shoky> the server is the one that has to allow it
[16:51:38] <shoky> not the client
[16:51:40] <duch_workbeer> joobie huh?  CORS is configured on the server you're pulling from.
[16:52:01] <duch_workbeer> joobie so if you're requesting from SiteB from siteA, the server for siteB need to support CORS
[16:52:03] <joobie> nod, im pulling the HTML from siteA
[16:52:06] <shoky> but i think you were saying the opposite before..
[16:52:20] <shoky> be careful with "from" and "to"
[16:52:27] <shoky> it's impossible to know which direction you actually mean
[16:53:03] <joobie> siteA has the button, which when pressed, pulls HTML out of the page of siteA and needs to send this to siteB
[16:53:18] <shoky> to send to siteB via an ajax request?
[16:53:25] <joobie> ajax is fine yes
[16:53:30] <shoky> then siteB is the one that needs to allow cross-domain
[16:53:32] <shoky> not siteA
[16:53:49] <joobie> sec let me try knock up a jsfiddle
[16:53:50] <duch_workbeer> joobie you said that you can't support CORS.
[16:57:45] <joobie> http://jsfiddle.net/5HkX6/
[16:57:55] <joobie> it's not really functional, but (i hope) explains it
[16:58:03] <joobie> that code would live on siteA
[16:58:25] <joobie> siteB would be waiting to receive that data
[16:58:42] <shoky> then siteB needs to allow it, like we said
[16:58:49] <shoky> you don't need to configure anything on siteA
[16:59:21] <shoky> ?g enable cors
[16:59:22] <joobie> I don't get why siteB would need to allow it though, isn't it a security consideration for siteA given the data exists on siteA and siteA would be concerned about if it shoudl pass it to siteB or not?
[16:59:22] <b-ot> shoky: enable cross-origin resource sharing â http://enable-cors.org/
[16:59:47] <shoky> joobie: the data exists on siteA but it is siteA that decided it wants to send the data
[17:00:18] <joobie> but what about things like cross-site injection
[17:00:20] <shoky> so the data is secure, because siteB can't pull the data by itself
[17:00:31] <joobie> i thought this protection was put in place to stop this sort of thing
[17:00:53] <tw2113> joobie, i think everyone is saying you have which end needs it mixed up
[17:01:00] <shoky> joobie it's meant to protect the server. not the client
[17:01:02] <joobie> but siteB doesn't need to specify to allow cross-site does it? given that it can just sit there and by default, accept data from anywhere?
[17:01:11] <joobie> ahh
[17:01:13] <shoky> well also the client
[17:01:47] <shoky> siteB does need to allow
[17:01:52] <shoky> siteB is the server
[17:02:48] <joobie> but if i am on siteA on some page like that jsfiddle example, if i craft an Ajax request there to send that HTML to siteB, how would siteB know it's coming from siteA's data? given the Ajax request is executed from my browser...
[17:03:05] <joobie> it's just like a normal post/get from my browser isnt it?
[17:03:11] <joobie> .. no tie back to siteA
[17:03:17] <duch_workbeer> joobie your browser is making the request to the server.
[17:03:33] <joobie> but that is independant of siteA right? given its running in my browser
[17:03:44] <joobie> .. so why does siteB need to allow it from siteA?
[17:04:02] <duch_workbeer> because siteB sees that siteA is the referring domain
[17:04:06] <shoky> but the browser "asks" siteB if siteB allows requests to be sent to it from a site hosted on siteA
[17:04:10] <joobie> .. given there's no reference to siteA, apart from the Ajax request existing in JS stored on siteA.. but siteB doesnt know this as it comes from my browser which sends that Ajax request
[17:04:27] <duch_workbeer> joobie but siteB sees which site you're on when the request is initiated.
[17:04:30] <shoky> the browser knows you're on siteA
[17:04:54] <joobie> ahh
[17:05:08] <joobie> so the browser is somehow integrating into this Ajax request
[17:05:27] <duch_workbeer> it's a referring domain.  kind of like when you click a link and go to another page.
[17:05:36] <duch_workbeer> not exactl.y
[17:05:37] <joobie> and adding an extra layer in there which says you cant run an Ajax request from siteA sending data to siteB unless siteB gives me the right header in the request?
[17:05:44] <shoky> yes^
[17:05:54] <joobie> interesting
[17:06:10] <shoky> unless duch has a better way to put it
[17:06:26] <joobie> i duno how secure that is though
[17:06:38] <joobie> i mean, if the goal is to stop data coming from siteA
[17:06:58] <joobie> can think of a few ways around it
[17:07:06] <duch_workbeer> no, the goal is to stop unauthorized requests.  you can explicitly say "only from siteA"  iirc
[17:08:05] <joobie> thanks for explaining btw :P
[17:08:10] <joobie> i understand better now
[17:09:17] <joobie> if i wanted to get around this
[17:09:32] <duch_workbeer> you can't ;)
[17:09:41] <joobie> couldn't i set a doctype of a HTML4 content type in a modern browser, if this CORS stuff is html5 based?
[17:09:53] <duch_workbeer> CORS is browser based.
[17:09:57] <duch_workbeer> not HTML5 based.
[17:10:05] <joobie> ahh
[17:11:49] <juboba> is there a way to capture keypress completely? as keydown + keyup as a single event?
[17:12:19] <duch_workbeer> juboba http://www.quirksmode.org/js/keys.html
[17:12:53] <juboba> thanks!
[17:14:23] <joobie> CORS just affects xmlhttprequest in JS or all socket connections?
[17:14:34] <duch_workbeer> sockets != http
[17:14:42] <duch_workbeer> don't conflate them.
[17:15:10] <joobie> so i can use something xmlhttprequest to create my own socket to siteB and bypass the CORS policy?
[17:15:36] <joobie> or socket.io
[17:15:37] <duch_workbeer> you're conflating things.
[17:15:59] <joobie> if the goal is to stop siteA from pulling data from siteB (in the case where CORS is adopted and set to block siteA)
[17:16:09] <duch_workbeer> still conflating.
[17:16:17] <joobie> bugger :)
[17:16:29] <duch_workbeer> the goal is to stop ALL sites, unless your allow that one or all.
[17:16:32] <joobie> if the goal is to stop siteA from making a HTTP request from siteB (in the case where CORS is adopted and set to block siteA)
[17:16:40] <duch_workbeer> that's not how CORS works.
[17:17:07] <duch_workbeer> CORS says "block everybody", "allow this one site", or "allow everybody"
[17:17:26] <joobie> can it be more than 1 site?
[17:17:37] <joobie> .. in the case of allowing specific sites
[17:17:43] <joobie> and blocking everything else
[17:18:04] <duch_workbeer> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[17:18:08] <duch_workbeer> read this
[17:18:31] <joobie> ok
[17:21:30] <joobie> I see
[17:21:39] <duch_workbeer> you can allow none, one, or all.
[17:21:48] <joobie> so the Browser is injecting the Origin header in all XMLHttpRequest connections right?
[17:22:08] <duch_workbeer> you cannot work around it as easily as you're suggesting ;)
[17:22:23] <joobie> I like to think outside the box :P
[17:23:16] <joobie> so if you used something like socket.io to establish a tcp connection to siteB's webserver and put together your own HTTP request via socket.io.. assuming socket.io doens't use xmlhttprequest under the hood, would the browser still add that origin header?
[17:24:41] <joobie> btw duch_workbeer here is some info on allowing multiple domains - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1653308/access-control-allow-origin-multiple-origin-domains
[17:25:26] <joobie> the header only supports 1.. but people are sending multiple Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers to support multiple domains or even parsing the Origin header and then dynamically sending the Allow back
[17:25:47] <joobie> interested in what you think RE that socket.io comment though
[17:25:54] <duch_workbeer> joobie fwiw, JS doesn't actually support sockets.
[17:25:57] <shoky> websockets are not raw tcp connections
[17:26:12] <rainabba> In a selector, there is a way to use :not() against classes isn't there? Something like 'element:not(className)' ?
[17:26:24] <joobie> but if they dont use xmlhttprequest, then does the browser not inject the Origin header ?
[17:26:30] <duch_workbeer> rainabba sure :not(.classname)
[17:26:37] <joobie> i mean, it's a socket.. it's not HTTP, so the browser assuming wont inject the header
[17:26:46] <joobie> .. then you could bypass this CORS protection.
[17:26:54] <joobie> .. if no Origin header is sent
[17:27:05] <duch_workbeer> right, and now you have a whole different set of needs.
[17:27:14] <rainabba> duch_workbeer: Ty, Case issue :)
[17:27:18] <joobie> it doesnt suit me duch_workbeer
[17:27:24] <joobie> i'm just thinking about what the purpose of CORS is
[17:27:40] <joobie> if you can bypass or spoof the origin
[17:27:44] <joobie> it's pretty useless isnt it?
[17:27:53] <duch_workbeer> it's terribly useful, actually.
[17:28:05] <duch_workbeer> it's apart of the suite of tools we have.
[17:28:22] <rainabba> joobie: If you build your own browser, you can spoof/bypass pretty much everything.
[17:28:25] <joobie> I could create some JS that uses socket.io, injects a fake Origin header and pull content from a site that thinks they are only allowing data to be pulled from a specific origin which i'm spoofing
[17:28:42] <joobie> you don't need to build your own browser, you just use socket.io and build the http request yourself
[17:28:47] <joobie> any browser then can bypass CORS
[17:28:47] <duch_workbeer> joobie you'd opening a socket to a server that uses sockets.
[17:28:58] <rainabba> joobie: Nothing is perfect, but when something addresses 99.999999% of users, it's pretty useful.
[17:29:01] <joobie> you'd be opening a TCP connection to a webserver
[17:29:06] <joobie> and then send the HTTP request manually
[17:29:11] <shoky> joobie go read about websockets
[17:29:13] <shoky> they are NOT raw
[17:29:14] <joobie> .. spoofing the Origin header, and breaking CORS
[17:29:16] <duch_workbeer> websockets are not raw TCP connections.
[17:29:23] <duch_workbeer> you are confused and conflating technologies.
[17:29:26] <shoky> you can't just say "i want to connect to this http url and download it"
[17:29:55] <rainabba> shoky: When you're that l33t you can!
[17:30:04] <shoky> truf
[17:30:28] <joobie> so node.js / socket.io can't establish just a tcp connection to a remote server that you can send and receive data through?
[17:30:40] <shoky> node can, but it's not a browser
[17:30:42] <joobie> we were talking a while back about using node.js to establish a socket via JS to another site
[17:30:42] <duch_workbeer> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21854516/understanding-ajax-cors-and-security-considerations read this
[17:31:15] <rainabba> http://imgur.com/KiBQh
[17:31:17] <joobie> OK, so if i wanted to bypass CORS protection - cant i just write a page that uses node.js to establish and manually craft the GET request to another site, spoofing the origin and then bypassing CORS?
[17:31:25] <shoky> if it uses node.js
[17:31:31] <shoky> then it's not the browser making the request
[17:31:43] <joobie> but node.js is called via the browser, via a webpage
[17:31:51] <joobie> which sounds like exactly what CORS is trying to achieve
[17:31:51] <duch_workbeer> joobie you're confused about who is protected by what :)
[17:31:53] <shoky> browser cant "call" node.js
[17:31:54] <rainabba> joobie: As I said, you can build your own browser (client if you want to get pedantic) to do anything
[17:31:59] <joobie> shoky
[17:32:02] <shoky> browser can send an ajax request to a node.js server
[17:32:06] <joobie> it sounds like (from my novice view)
[17:32:28] <shoky> it sounds like you're trying to argue before you've let any information sink in
[17:32:29] <joobie> that the purpose of CORS is to give siteB the ability to say only let people on siteA pull content from me from within a webpage hosted on siteA
[17:32:30] <shoky> so stop
[17:32:35] <shoky> and breathe
[17:32:43] <rainabba> joobie: CORS isn't about protecting the server, it's about protecting the user of the browser (injection) Go read and stop arguing.
[17:32:46] <duch_workbeer> joobie you REALLY think that the groups working on these things would leave something so simplistic open?
[17:33:04] <joobie> if you can setup a page on siteC that uses node.js and spoofs the origin header in the process, then siteB will think it's siteA and serve the content.. therefore making CORS broke
[17:33:04] * rainabba again points out: http://imgur.com/KiBQh
[17:33:16] <duch_workbeer> joobie nope.
[17:33:21] <joobie> duch_workbeer, why is it wrong?
[17:33:23] <shoky> joobie: it's only about what the browser can do or not do, when loading a page from a certain site
[17:33:26] <duch_workbeer> joobie go read.
[17:33:47] <shoky> webpages can't use node.js
[17:33:55] <joobie> duch_workbeer, if CORS is targeting just xmlhttprequest, then yes they have left it open
[17:34:02] <duch_workbeer> joobie they have not :)
[17:34:10] <duch_workbeer> joobie sockets don't connect the way you think they do.
[17:34:25] <joobie> duch_workbeer, node.js makes a tcp connection
[17:34:32] <joobie> and you can pass data back and forth down that connection
[17:34:33] <duch_workbeer> joobie CORS assumes there is a user in the middle of all of this.
[17:34:40] <duch_workbeer> "For example, Alice is logged into Google. Alice visits malicious.example which uses XMLHttpRequest to access data from gmail.com. Alice has a GMail account so the response has a list of the most recent email in her inbox. The same origin policy prevents malicious.example from reading it."
[17:34:41] <joobie> so you can create your own HTTP request/responses via that connection right?
[17:34:49] <duch_workbeer> read what i just posted.
[17:34:57] <joobie> ok
[17:35:08] <shoky> joobie with a server-side proxy you can bypass SOP, yes
[17:35:13] <shoky> if that's the point you're trying to make
[17:35:46] <shoky> but it's the server making the request to siteB, not the browser
[17:36:13] <joobie> duch_workbeer, but knowing that CORS will block malicious.example if it uses XMLHttpRequest, why wouldn't you then setup malicious.example to use node.js instead?
[17:36:17] <joobie> that's my point.
[17:36:36] <duch_workbeer> joobie because then you don't have the client authenticated against it.
[17:36:53] <duch_workbeer> joobie you need that authenticated third party to be involved.
[17:36:55] <joobie> I see
[17:36:58] <joobie> so cookies is the issue?
[17:37:01] <shoky> it's not dangerous for the browser user if some other computer running node.js is making a connection somewhere
[17:37:09] <joobie> then CORS would need to have protected the cookie layer also to JS
[17:37:19] <joobie> ive not pushed into this part of JS.. not sure if you can access cookies via JS
[17:37:20] <duch_workbeer> joobie this is FAR more complicated than you're making it.
[17:37:43] <joobie> but if you can, then node.js is still a valid bypass of CORS, because you just pass the cookie in that same request via node.js and it's authenticated
[17:37:55] <joobie> duch_workbeer, just exploring security.. find it interesting :P
[17:38:15] <duch_workbeer> joobie if you think you just need a cookie, you're sorely mistaken ;)
[17:38:37] <joobie> the cookie is what handles the authentication in most cases
[17:38:45] <duch_workbeer> sure why not.
[17:38:58] <joobie> some sites will go the extra mile and confirm against headers it expects to see also
[17:39:05] <duch_workbeer> so you really think sites set the cookie once and then just trust it from there?
[17:39:07] <joobie> but most sites for auth will just use the cookie
[17:39:20] <joobie> and src ip, and sometimes additional headers
[17:39:41] <joobie> what else is there duch_workbeer ?
[17:39:44] <duch_workbeer> :)
[17:39:51] <duch_workbeer> i think you have a lot to learn.
[17:39:57] <joobie> what else? :)
[17:40:08] <joobie> there is cookies, and there are sessions
[17:40:12] <joobie> serverside sessions
[17:40:18] <joobie> which are maintained by headers
[17:40:21] <duch_workbeer> https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet
[17:40:22] <joobie> that is all.
[17:40:41] <joobie> yes, but these sessions are maintained by headers
[17:40:51] <duch_workbeer> you really think it's that simple?
[17:40:58] <joobie> yes, i used to write session based auth
[17:41:00] <joobie> and cookie based auth
[17:41:12] <joobie> they are that simple.
[17:41:19] <duch_workbeer> they CAN be that simple.
[17:41:24] <duch_workbeer> meanwhile, my system is a little more robust.
[17:41:26] <joobie> no, they ARE that simple.
[17:41:38] <joobie> debug your auth request to GMAIL
[17:41:39] <joobie> you will see.
[17:41:53] <duch_workbeer> i'm saying there's an extra layer in there you're not considering :)
[17:42:03] <joobie> i used to amplify the security by looking for additional headers, like making sure the useragent header is the same ontop of the session
[17:42:25] <joobie> but these are just header based or cookie based.. unless you start going extreme into areas which 99.9% of sites wont go.
[17:42:25] <duch_workbeer> so then why don't we have much larger security breaches more often?
[17:42:53] <duch_workbeer> read that page I linked.
[17:43:09] <joobie> bro, how do you think cookie based auth works
[17:43:15] <joobie> or session based auth
[17:43:21] <duch_workbeer> bro, go read the OWASP page i linked
[17:43:30] <joobie> the tie between client and server is done via headers.
[17:43:32] <joobie> that is all..
[17:43:51] <joobie> there's no magic that happens outside of the data that is sent in that REQUEST from the client
[17:44:03] <joobie> and the REQUEST sends the information for the server to tie the connection together
[17:44:25] <joobie> sockets are not always keep-alive, so sockets open and close.. the server doesnt know who is who without the headers in this case.
[17:44:40] <duch_workbeer> and you cannot use a socket to connect to a random web page.
[17:45:00] <Meekro> Question for you guys: I have this super-simple accordion example using the latest jquery+jqueryui libraries, but the background looks wrong: http://jsfiddle.net/a7nST/2/
[17:45:25] <joobie> node.js you can
[17:45:37] <duch_workbeer> joobie and then you don't have the third party you need.
[17:45:47] <joobie> "The session management implementation defines the exchange mechanism that will be used between the user and the web application to share and continuously exchange the session ID. There are multiple mechanisms available in HTTP to maintain session state within web applications, such as cookies (standard HTTP header), URL parameters (URL rewriting â RFC 2396), URL arguments on GET requests, body arguments on POST requests, such
[17:45:47] <joobie>  as hidden form fields (HTML forms), or proprietary HTTP headers. "
[17:45:51] <joobie> that is from your page duch_workbeer
[17:45:56] <duch_workbeer> keep reading.
[17:46:18] <joobie> (1) cookies (2) URL parameters (2) URL ARGS (3) body args on POST requests
[17:46:31] <Sal> hi
[17:46:34] <duch_workbeer> whatever dude.  go ahead and break into amazon then,.
[17:47:10] <joobie> duch_workbeer, you're implying sessions / cookies is handled in a way that I understand it not to be
[17:47:16] <joobie> that article says the 3 methods its handled by
[17:47:18] <duch_workbeer> that's not what i'm saying.
[17:47:23] <joobie> how is it handled then?
[17:47:32] <duch_workbeer> https is a thing.
[17:48:01] <joobie> HTTPS is another layer yes
[17:48:03] <duch_workbeer> the malicious site can't access cookies it doesn't have permission to access (read: any not from its domain)
[17:48:11] <shoky> "another layer" hah
[17:48:16] <duch_workbeer> lmao
[17:48:19] <duch_workbeer> i give up.,
[17:48:23] <joobie> HTTPS is not used for session identification shoky
[17:48:28] <shoky> correct
[17:48:31] <duch_workbeer> yep.
[17:48:36] <joobie> it's another factor that can be used to segreate the sessions
[17:48:36] <duch_workbeer> let me guess:
[17:48:37] <wb_twerp_> is ther a way to load list of files that karma sees ?
[17:48:42] <wb_twerp_> damn karma config
[17:48:44] <joobie> but dont be confused, it's not session isolation.
[17:48:53] <Sal> on page scrolling up, is there a way to know which div is the most nearest to the screen top?
[17:49:37] <duch_workbeer> Sal sure - enumerate through every div on scroll and return the one whose vertical offset is closest to the window's
[17:49:39] <shoky> joobie: we're laughing because it's not JUST another layer
[17:50:18] <Sal> duch_workbeer, do all that in every scroll move? wont that slow down scrolling?
[17:50:21] <shoky> it's.. THE layer
[17:50:29] <joobie> shoky, i'm laughing because HTTPS was thrown around as the answer for how session isolation is handled
[17:50:38] <duch_workbeer> Sal it can be unless you cache everything ahead of time.
[17:50:40] <shoky> not really
[17:50:48] <duch_workbeer> joobie you're redefining the discussion.
[17:51:10] <joobie> anyway it's getting a bit heated
[17:51:20] <joobie> let's leave it :)
[17:51:35] <joobie> it was a good discussion nonetheless
[17:51:59] <shoky> joobie: cookies are encrypted, so it won't help the node.js malicious server if you send it the cookie
[17:52:04] <Sal> duch_workbeer, maybe there's another way to do ii... i want to copy some divs text to a navigation bar second line when the div passes under the bar its self
[17:52:14] <duch_workbeer> Sal have a fiddle?
[17:52:42] <Sal> i can so that easly with the scroll up, but my problem is that i need to delete the text and show the one of a previouse div, when it scrolls back down
[17:52:44] <duch_workbeer> joobie fwiw i work for one of the larger ecommerce companies in the US, so while I'm by no means an expert, I'm not a moron.
[17:52:54] <Sal> no, i'll do one
[17:53:24] <wb_twerp_> does anyone know karma irc channel ?
[17:53:37] <joobie> shoky, you don't need to decrypt the cookie to send it via node.js.. you just send it in its encrypted form
[17:53:41] <duch_workbeer> wb_twerp_ try using /list *karma*
[17:54:10] <duch_workbeer> "all right guys lets not have this convo any more.  but seriously, this is as trivial as I'm saying it is."
[17:54:41] <wb_twerp_> duch_workbeer: thanks.. but none :/
[17:54:47] <duch_workbeer> wb_twerp_ sucks.
[17:54:55] <duch_workbeer> and with that, i go home.
[17:54:58] <duch_workbeer> enjoy folks.
[17:55:01] <joobie> cya duch_workbeer
[17:55:06] <wb_twerp_> is there a way to list files that karma server sees ?
[17:55:11] <joobie> duch_workbeer
[17:55:15] <joobie> one more thing that just hit me
[17:55:22] <joobie> to think on your way home about how effective CORS is
[17:55:24] <duch_workbeer> wb_twerp_ try asking in #Node.js
[17:55:36] <joobie> CORS is not implying that it works when you have sessions / cookies / HTTPS ..
[17:55:37] <duch_workbeer> wow you just can't let it go.
[17:55:38] <wb_twerp_> duch_workbeer: yeah good idea
[17:55:56] <duch_workbeer> joobie seriously go read up.
[17:56:00] <joobie> so think about those uses where CORS fails when there no sessions/ cookies / https
[17:56:12] <joobie> just straight requests, which CORS is meant to address
[17:56:29] <duch_workbeer> i fear for the applications you work on.
[17:56:30] <duch_workbeer> g'night
[18:09:18] <Sal> can someone help me on this: http://jsfiddle.net/Vx8w4/2/
[18:09:49] <Sal> when scrolling up, i want the header text to be shown inside navbar second-line
[18:10:01] <Sal> and when scrolled back, to be deleted
[18:11:20] <Sal> can someone help?
[18:17:58] <Woet> Sal: where is your JS that will make that happen?
[18:18:24] <Sal> hehe, thats the part i don't know how to do
[18:18:35] <Sal> i mean, i have it to stick a header
[18:18:48] <Sal> but i can't find a way to just copy text
[18:19:19] <Sal> my problem is when it scrolls back
[18:19:30] <Sal> i need to delete header2 and put on header1
[18:20:13] <Sal> if you want, i can put my js code that sticks the header, but i don't think it will be useful
[18:20:53] <Meekro> does anyone know what's wrong with my accordion? This is the simplest example I can get with the latest jquery and jquery-ui, and the background looks wrong: http://jsfiddle.net/a7nST/
[18:23:40] <Woet> Sal: we don't write code for you, you write the code and ask us for help with specific errors/issues with that code
[18:24:08] <Sal> ok,  i will
[18:24:10] <Sal> 2 secs
[18:28:48] <Sal> woet: here's the code http://jsfiddle.net/Vx8w4/4/
[18:29:30] <Sal> how can i change it to move the header inside the navigation second-line instead of sticking it under the navigationbar?
[18:30:23] <Sal> i can try to copy text, but i can't restore it when scrolling bak
[18:30:33] <Sal> should i save text in an array?
[18:30:48] <Sal> or should i just query for divs with top less that 80
[18:36:05] <Sal> http://jsfiddle.net/Vx8w4/5/
[18:36:39] <Sal> now it transfers header to navbar, but it doesn't clead nav bar when header1 goes back
[18:36:50] <Sal> thats the only thing that is missing
[18:36:54] <Sal> can u help?
[18:48:31] <Sal> http://jsfiddle.net/Vx8w4/5/
[19:08:34] <Sal> http://jsfiddle.net/Vx8w4/6/
[19:08:40] <Sal> why line 15 is not working
[19:09:21] <sc_> what are you trying to do?
[19:10:06] <Sal> sc_: when you scroll bak, i want the header to clean just like when you start
[19:10:21] <Sal> when header2 scrolls back, it restores header1
[19:10:36] <Sal> but when header1 scrolls back, it should clean
[19:10:45] <Sal> thats what line 15 should do
[19:11:35] <Sal> sc_ any idea why its not cleaning?
[19:12:09] <sc_> im so confused
[19:13:12] <HowardwLo> wahts the best way to set a delay on clearInterval ?
[19:17:28] <systemfault> HowardwLo: Just donât use it. Write an async loop with setTimeout.
[19:17:39] <systemfault> http://www.erichynds.com/blog/a-recursive-settimeout-pattern
[19:20:36] <HowardwLo> systemfault: the loop occurs to ofast for me
[19:20:48] <HowardwLo> i need to have a delay between each loop, im not sure how to do that
[19:21:18] <HowardwLo> function() { scroll down on page, wait 5 seconds, repeat 5 times }
[21:19:38] <gmisura> greets
[21:28:02] <gmisura> does calling ajax and settimeout not wait the full amount?
[21:29:50] <BillCriswell> gmisura: Not sure I'm following that question.
[21:30:59] <gmisura> http://pastebin.com/8KPf3AhY
[21:31:19] <gmisura> the settimeout is 5000 which is 5 seconds, right?
[21:31:41] <gmisura> but i see the function being called every 1-2 seconds...
[21:34:47] <BillCriswell> gmisura: You would need to do setTimeout(function() { check_report_status(hashtag_val); }, 5000);
[21:35:05] <gmisura> hrm, ok. why?
[21:35:07] <BillCriswell> setTimeout(check_report_status(hashtag_val), 5000) would call it immediately.
[21:35:21] <gmisura> oh
[21:36:39] <skypce> hello all
[21:36:56] <BillCriswell> check_report_status(hashtag_val) returns the value of that function, not a reference to a function
[21:36:57] <skypce> why doesnt move html content to other div : http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xeqyA
[21:37:11] <gmisura> BillCriswell thanks! perfect!
[21:37:11] <skypce> please
[21:37:34] <BillCriswell> gmisura: No problem.
[21:38:36] <BillCriswell> skypce: Do you want to move the entire element into another?
[21:38:48] <skypce> yes
[21:38:52] <skypce> BillCriswell, yes
[21:39:16] <BillCriswell> I think you want to do: $("#testimonial-wrapper").append(".item.active .imgBg")
[21:40:42] <skypce> BillCriswell, but how can i load item.active .imgBg inside of div #testimonials?
[21:40:56] <skypce> div #testimonials is a empty div
[21:42:18] <BillCriswell> skypce: http://jsbin.com/tuhiy/1/edit
[21:42:40] <BillCriswell> I messed up before. You would need to do $("#testimonial-wrapper").append($(".item.active .imgBg"))
[21:43:23] <BillCriswell> skypce: http://jsbin.com/tuhiy/2/edit?js,output styling makes it alittle clearer here.
[21:44:01] <skypce> very thank you BillCriswell
[21:44:10] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[21:54:23] <gmisura> ison BillCriswell
[22:12:41] <newbrict> Hi
[22:15:22] <Guest54867> hello ... excuse me .. what is the best way to make transitions between iframe?
[23:22:48] <ryez> b = $('body'); b == $(b.selector), I got false, why?
[23:23:07] <sc_> why do that?
[23:24:01] <ryez> I want to check if the element (cached) is still itself after DOM update
[23:24:23] <sc_> hasClass?
[23:25:53] <ryez> yeah, hasClass can be a valid workaround
[23:30:20] <ryez> oh, I should be comparing b[0] == $(b.selector)[0]
[23:54:22] <IAAAH> referring to the jquery src: if i were to use ajax/load.js; to load an svg, would i need any of the other ajax/modules? I would think maybe ajax/parseXML.js, but im just guessing.
[23:55:07] <brunoais> IAAAH, if you are using svg, just use the plain DOM ;)
[23:55:32] <brunoais> for the browsers that support svg, they follow the spec quite well already
[23:55:56] <brunoais> at least, in the AJAX's set of methods and properties
[23:56:10] <brunoais> IAAAH, ^
[23:56:32] <IAAAH> ^ what do you mean (literally). i am new-ish, but pretty quick.
[23:56:58] <brunoais> IAAAH, well you seem to only need to do a request to a server and get a response, right?
[23:57:12] <brunoais> and then you have the response in XML
[23:58:15] <IAAAH> im not even sure exactly TBH. it's the only way I have been able to load in svg's and manipulate them via css and without cluttering up my html.
[23:58:46] <IAAAH> but i would say, yes, (i think)
