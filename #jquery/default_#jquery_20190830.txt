[07:34:24] <eoli3n> Hi
[07:35:01] <eoli3n> why can't i see data when i run $.get(url).done(function(data) { console.log(data) });
[07:35:07] <eoli3n> in browser console
[07:35:13] <eoli3n> it returns an object
[07:36:13] <Robdgreat> consisting of what?
[07:36:26] <eoli3n> data?
[07:36:34] <eoli3n> a string
[07:36:35] <Robdgreat> but you said you can't see data
[07:36:54] <eoli3n> it return an object instead of a string
[07:37:14] <eoli3n> {readyState: 1, getResponseHeader: ƒ, getAllResponseHeaders: ƒ, setRequestHeader: ƒ, overrideMimeType: ƒ, …}
[07:37:20] <Robdgreat> where does it say it's supposed to be a string?
[07:37:38] <eoli3n> because the url returns a string
[07:38:55] <eoli3n> from my webserver -> http://ix.io/1TPc
[07:39:28] <eoli3n> its returns a csv but that's a string
[07:41:59] <eoli3n> oh... does get method read the port in url ?
[07:42:07] <eoli3n> link.fr:8080 ?
[07:42:11] <Robdgreat> it should
[07:42:22] <Robdgreat> but the "readyState: 1" means something's going wrong in your request
[07:42:37] <eoli3n> my x problem is that i have a timeout on that get request
[07:42:39] <Robdgreat> if it were succeeding the readyState should be 4
[07:42:47] <eoli3n> but when i do it on the webserver it works
[07:42:52] <eoli3n> so its not network
[07:43:17] <Robdgreat> "on the webserver" means "in the browser directly"?
[07:43:54] <eoli3n> with ssh/bash on the web server
[07:44:07] <eoli3n> i try in the browser
[07:44:15] <eoli3n> in console and it return my y problem
[07:44:40] <Robdgreat> can you access the url in your browser's address bar?
[07:45:28] <eoli3n> no, that's the pb... the url is like http://server.fr:8080/mail.adress@mail.fr
[07:45:35] <eoli3n> i think '@' is problematic
[07:45:52] <eoli3n> oh, just a sec
[07:46:03] <Robdgreat> try %40 instead of @
[07:46:26] <eoli3n> ok i got the thing...
[07:46:28] <eoli3n> get is js
[07:46:31] <eoli3n> js in on the host
[07:46:45] <eoli3n> so i need to open from the host to the getted srv
[07:46:59] <Robdgreat> I don't understand
[07:47:07] <eoli3n> i found my problem
[07:47:16] <eoli3n> the dest srv isn't open for all
[07:47:25] <Robdgreat> fair enough
[07:47:31] <eoli3n> i requested to my network adm to open from webserv to requestedsrv
[07:47:42] <eoli3n> but as i get the url, that's the browser which request it
[07:47:50] <Robdgreat> yeah I figured it could be somthing like that when you acted like it working locally proved that there was no problem
[07:47:52] <eoli3n> so i need to put the request in php page and request it
[07:48:16] <eoli3n> but that was my mistake : its doesnt work locally
[07:48:19] <eoli3n> sorry for taht
[07:48:20] <eoli3n> that
[07:48:29] <Robdgreat> you said it worked when you ssh to the webserver
[07:48:43] <Robdgreat> I meant local to the webserver
[07:48:56] <eoli3n> yep
[07:49:03] <eoli3n> but js is not runnin on the webserver
[07:49:07] <eoli3n> running
[07:49:15] <Robdgreat> that doesn't matter
[07:49:22] <eoli3n> it does :)
[07:49:46] <eoli3n> because as JS gets the url, i need to network open from everywhere TO the requested srv
[07:49:46] <Robdgreat> I wouldn't have said it didn't if it did
[07:49:50] <eoli3n> and i can't do that
[07:50:02] <Robdgreat> so use something else
[07:50:06] <eoli3n> yep
[07:50:13] <eoli3n> i will put the request in php
[07:50:20] <eoli3n> and get the local php file
[07:50:37] <Robdgreat> why are you using ajax in the first place if you can do it serverside?
[07:50:56] <eoli3n> because the request is triggered by some events
[09:08:36] <crs> Hi there, could I get some help with .hide(), please? I have select2 input dialog and when I hide() it it increases its size before animation starts, it gets out of it's container… I have no idea what to do. Showing it works perfect, but hiding acts up weirdly. Thanks!
[09:14:44] <crs> Here is what it looks like: http://i.imgur.com/qwRiIkV.gif and here's code I managed to put together: https://dpaste.de/zG4n
[09:39:27] <eoli3n> hmm
[09:39:40] <eoli3n> i want to make an automatic admin mode with phpCAS
[09:40:12] <eoli3n> if user is from my service override some vars before starting jquery script
[09:40:32] <eoli3n> those vars need to be in a form
[09:40:42] <eoli3n> it let admin user to work on another user
[09:40:55] <eoli3n> if not admin, it force the work on the current user
[09:41:30] <eoli3n> i created a test after CAS connexion and i wanted to redirect
[09:59:16] <eoli3n> sorry, telefon
[09:59:21] <eoli3n> phone
[09:59:28] <eoli3n> and i have my idea so...
[13:33:08] <rwtrecs> hello.. can anybody help me?
[13:33:33] <taplar> possibly.  what's up?
[13:35:11] <rwtrecs> hello taplar.. I'm having trouble with jQuery Ajax and MySQL. so, I have one page with multiple tabs, and when I try to load anyone, the MySQL Select don't work.
[13:35:21] <rwtrecs> and thanks for the support.
[13:36:00] <taplar> can you show us how you are trying to execute the ajax?
[13:36:21] <rwtrecs> yes, sure.. one moment
[13:39:35] <crs> rwtrecs: In the meantime, is there any chance you could help me with .hide() misbehaving, please?
[13:40:24] <taplar> crs if you have a question, ask the room in general.  no need to ping a specific person, :)
[13:41:00] <rwtrecs> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/rwtrecs/fxc86b9y/
[13:41:10] <rwtrecs> I put just the jQuery code
[13:42:00] <taplar> ok, so if you `console.log(remoteUrl)` before you make the ajax call, what do you see in the console?
[13:42:09] <rwtrecs> sorry crs, I'm getting help too..
[13:44:33] <rwtrecs> I see the name of the PHP arquive, like: filename.php. this file is related with the tab in question.
[13:45:04] <taplar> alright, so your ajax request is making a GET request to that endpoint
[13:46:00] <taplar> Switch over to your network tab in your developer tools and find the request related to that endpoint
[13:46:15] <taplar> make sure it's going to the correct url, and find out what the response code is
[13:57:11] <rwtrecs> ok, I'm getting the name of the arquive and the status 200. I don't know if this is right..
[13:58:23] <taplar> yep, 200 is an OK
[13:58:38] <taplar> alright, so if you click that request, a window should pop open on the right hand side
[13:58:50] <taplar> in there you should find a tab or something for the response returned
[13:58:58] <taplar> what browser are you using?
[14:02:00] <rwtrecs> yes, I can do that.. I can see many details.
[14:02:14] <rwtrecs> I'm using Google Chrome Developer
[14:03:50] <taplar> alright, so you found the response tab, yes?
[14:05:44] <rwtrecs> yes..
[14:05:56] <taplar> alright, so does the response look like what you are expecting?
[14:09:01] <rwtrecs> to be honest yes.. I think that the problem is with the parameter: 'data-ajax-url' in the a link
[14:09:27] <rwtrecs> I'm going to look that.. thanks so much taplar :)
[14:09:54] <taplar> you're thinking the url is incorrect?
[14:12:34] <rwtrecs> yes, I think that I put the url in the wrong way
[16:04:50] <eoli3n_> hi

[16:10:25] <crs> I need some help with .hide(), please? I have select2 input dialog and when I hide() it it increases its size before animation starts, it gets out of it's container… I have no idea what to do. Showing it works perfect, but hiding acts up weirdly. Thanks!
[16:10:36] <crs> Here is what it looks like: http://i.imgur.com/qwRiIkV.gif and here's code I managed to put together: https://dpaste.de/zG4n
[16:17:36] <eoli3n_> https://jsfiddle.net/w6v509yb/1/

[16:26:33] <eoli3n_> np taplar
[16:26:44] <taplar> fridays man....
[16:33:45] <crs> taplar: No problem at all! Appreciate any help, I am completely blocked with this one, no clue how to try to resolve it.
[16:39:47] <taplar> crs can you make a fiddle showing that behaviour?
[16:40:54] <taplar> eoli3n take a look at the css file.  I don't see that class in there.
