[17:37:18] <rednaZ[m]> "button option is deprecated in 1.5 and will be removed in 1.6" (https://api.jquerymobile.com/button/)
[17:37:38] <rednaZ[m]> What does that even mean?
[17:38:05] <rednaZ[m]> Do they mean the function `.button()`?
[17:53:06] <shoky> rednaZ[m]: seems that they mean the option you're reading it on, typo/bug in docs
[17:53:18] <shoky> e.g. for "mini" option they got it right:   Note: mini option is deprecated in 1.5 and will be removed in 1.6
[17:54:08] <rednaZ[m]> I am trying jquery mobile for the first time and I keep getting `.button is not a function`
[17:55:08] <rednaZ[m]> Indeed I cannot find any demo that uses `.button()` although it is clearly documented in https://api.jquerymobile.com/1.4/button/ .
[17:55:45] <rednaZ[m]> s/documented/exemplified/
[17:56:00] <shoky> sounds like you're not including jquery mobile correctly. btw.. i dont really think jquery mobile is alive or maintained
[17:56:41] <rednaZ[m]> I have a small old jquery ui page and need it on mobile
[17:56:52] <rednaZ[m]> using buttons and sliders only
[17:57:15] <rednaZ[m]> So I figured using jquery mobile would be the easiest option
[17:58:23] <shoky> last update was ~7 years ago, i wouldn't use it myself
[17:59:44] <rednaZ[m]> https://gist.github.com/prednaz/ff5bdc05f608acc9fe4e7e281b7d5ad0
[18:00:04] <rednaZ[m]> Am I including jquery mobile incorrectly?
[18:00:07] <shoky> why is your script surrounded with {   }  ?
[18:00:36] <rednaZ[m]> So identifiers do not leak into the global name space, I guess.
[18:01:02] <shoky> {  }   is an object literal..
[18:01:12] <shoky> you wanted a function there i guess
[18:02:30] <rednaZ[m]> Same result without brackets.
[18:03:00] <shoky> rednaZ[m]: seems jquerymobile doesnt work with jquery 3+
[18:03:09] <shoky> use jquery 2
[18:03:14] <rednaZ[m]> Thanks.
