[09:08:32] <burtnein> Hi, I am wondering how hard or easy it is to implement dragging and dropping in jQuery or JS.
[09:09:21] <Woet> about 9 easies and 4 hards
[09:11:14] <burtnein> A use case could be dragging in a particular image or text element into an empty input box which is then filled in
[12:45:31] <burtnein> Hi guys, I'm wondering what happens when you use jQuery to locate IDS
[12:45:34] <burtnein> But not any IDS
[12:45:37] <burtnein> smth like that
[12:45:44] <burtnein> <div id="0,1,2,3">
[12:46:02] <burtnein> When I pass in this ID as string, prepending with #
[12:46:15] <burtnein> I always get back an element that has the following ID "0"
[12:46:36] <burtnein> but it never finds an element with id "0,1" even if I pass in this exact string into $()
[12:46:57] <burtnein> Is it somehow thinking it's not a string but a number?
[13:10:28] <decx> , is not allowed as per spec
[16:24:50] <dglambert> yo
[16:58:27] <lewix> what's the best way to find the first tr
[16:58:53] <lewix> 'tr:first' is a way (ideally without using pseudo selector)
[17:15:56] <mmmveggies> lewix: $('tr').first() maybe?
[17:16:05] <mmmveggies> also .eq(0)
[17:24:58] <lewix> $('tr') is supposed to select all tr element right?
[17:25:09] <lewix> I'm suprised that the chrome browser returns just one
[17:27:14] <lewix> i see
[17:27:24] <lewix> chrome assign get element by id to $
[17:39:23] <shoky> lewix: yes in chrome console, $ is by default document.querySelector
[17:39:33] <shoky> lewix:  and $$ is document.querySelectorAll  which you might prefer
[17:39:49] <lewix> yes
[17:40:04] <shoky> (neither are jquery, of course)
[17:40:15] <lewix> is there a plugin shokyu youre familiar with that might make jquery the default
[17:40:27] <lewix> shoky: *
[17:40:38] <shoky> lewix: for every site? there are probably extensions that do it.. donno
[17:41:48] <shoky> there are also snippets or bookmarklets that inject jquery into the page, found it handy in the past
[17:42:21] <shoky> extension seems overkill ;p
[22:31:25] <jak2000> hi all, why when i modify a .js file not load the lastest changes? (of couse before runnin my webpage i save the .js file), i use chrome and webtools, i need erase all browser cache data... (2,3 times in the day), any advice?
