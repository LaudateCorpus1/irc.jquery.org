[03:41:27] <eip56> try f12
[06:44:23] <Happzz> i use PJAX, which worked fine until i made some large changes.
[06:44:34] <Happzz> now, it retrieves the destination page fine
[06:44:41] <Happzz> but it doesn't replace the target's content
[06:45:05] <Happzz> the console gives and error like Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [the whole ajax output in here]
[06:50:55] <Happzz> any ideas?
[08:31:30] <clime> hey, is it ok to use   var nodes = $('.node'); for (var i = 0; i < nodes.length; i++) { ... }    instead of   nodes.each(function(i, v) { ... }). Is something bad gonna happen if I use the normal for loop?
[08:34:17] <Daghdha> Hi. I am trying to use jQuery List DragSort, it works fine on lists that exist as the page is loaded. But i can't get it to work on a list that i fill dynamically using $("#ImageFrameDivs").html(e.response.framedivs);.   When i do and i try to call dragsort on the newly added list it says. JavaScript runtime error: Object doesn't support property or method 'dragsort'
[08:34:38] <Daghdha> How can i 'bind' that method onto the list later? Is there a trick to do so?
[08:36:43] <JeffChew> hi there, may I know how to display the countdown in min + sec? the code at here --> http://jsbin.com/OLanIbUq/1/edit
[08:41:32] <shoky> JeffChew: Math.floor(num/60) for minutes, num%60 for seconds
[08:42:45] <JeffChew> shoky, with the current code may I know where did can I add the display the time left? to be honest, this code came from other I just only amend it to load instead of click
[08:43:10] <shoky> you want me to do it for you?
[08:46:37] <JeffChew> shoky, appreciate if you can help me on that
[08:47:53] <shoky> JeffChew: http://jsbin.com/OLanIbUq/2/edit   hire a coder
[08:48:30] <JeffChew> shoky, thank you very much!!!
[08:48:38] <JeffChew> i really appreciated it
[08:48:40] <JeffChew> thanks man!!
[08:49:02] <shoky> yerp
[08:51:42] <JeffChew> shoky, I just wondering, if I possible to loop again if the countdown finish?
[08:52:14] <shoky> JeffChew anything's possible
[08:52:50] <Celtiore> hi
[08:53:15] <Celtiore> how can i set default theme to 'b' with jqm 1.4.0 pls
[08:53:56] <JeffChew> shoky, which part should I edit and what code to add in?
[08:55:44] <shoky> JeffChew that's not what this channel is for, sry
[08:56:05] <shoky> (nor any channel)
[08:56:36] <shoky> i miss that shirt ;[
[08:56:38] <JeffChew> ok then do you mind to point any website that teach how to loop countdown when end?
[08:56:42] <shoky> oops wrong window sry
[08:57:10] <shoky> JeffChew i dont know a website that teaches that exactly..
[08:57:33] <shoky> you might want to learn javascript
[08:58:26] <JeffChew> I don't mind to learn but now Im googling the question by no luck to get the answer
[09:03:32] <Daghdha> Anyone that can recommend a simple drag/drop sort library?
[09:06:27] <JeffChew_> shoky, mind to help me for the last time?
[09:07:59] <shoky> JeffChew_ http://jsbin.com/OLanIbUq/5/edit
[09:09:05] <clime> Daghdha: what about jquery ui draggable and sortable
[09:10:39] <JeffChew_> shoky, thank you!!
[09:10:50] <JeffChew_> I'll start learn javascript :)
[09:12:21] <RRR2> why will YOU do that
[09:13:36] <Daghdha> clime: I th ink my problem is more due to adding the list after page load with ajax. Then when i call the dragsort it throws an error. I t hink i probably will have  the same erroro with jquery ui. <script type="text/javascript">$("#cows").dragsort();</script> works. Later calling $("#cows").dragsort(); fails.
[09:15:13] <shoky> Daghdha make sure you're not including jquery more than once
[09:16:25] <Daghdha> i'm not, checked.
[09:17:21] <Daghdha> Works: <script type="text/javascript">$("#cows").dragsort();</script>
[09:17:21] <Daghdha> Throws error when clicked: <div onclick="$('#cows').dragsort();return false;">byhand</div>
[09:17:33] <Daghdha> It throws: JavaScript runtime error: Object doesn't support property or method 'dragsort'
[09:18:13] <shoky> shouldn't use onclick attributes
[09:18:22] <shoky> anyway.. make a jsfiddle/demo
[09:20:00] <Daghdha> ok i will have a stab at that
[09:29:58] <raj> Happy new year everyone!
[09:30:43] * shoky smooch
[11:20:51] <i_like_geckos> Hey, could someone help me with a simple jQuery script (literally several lines)?
[11:21:16] <i_like_geckos> I'm a complete jQuery newbie and I'm trying to implement a scrolling script into my website
[11:25:40] <rivarun> i_like_geckos: go ahead and ask your specific question
[12:30:15] <i_like_geckos> Am I allowed to post code here?
[12:30:57] <BinaryKitten> i_like_geckos please use a pastebin or a jsfiddle
[12:31:09] <i_like_geckos> OK :)
[12:31:19] <i_like_geckos> I have a simple (5/6 line) jQuery script to scroll to the top of a DIV element on my webpage, but I also have a fixed top bar. I would like the scrolling to take account of this and stop when it comes into contact with the bottom of this DIV.
[12:31:23] <i_like_geckos> I will post an example
[12:34:15] <i_like_geckos> Just uploading now
[12:39:50] <i_like_geckos> http://dev.joelcieslar.me.uk/preview/ <-- use the arrows please further down, you'll see my problem. Haven't made all of them work yet :)
[12:59:02] <shoky> i_like_geckos: you can decrease the scrollTop value by the navbar's height
[12:59:19] <i_like_geckos> how would I do that?
[12:59:27] <i_like_geckos> Give it a minus number?
[12:59:32] <shoky> yah
[12:59:37] <shoky> a - b
[13:00:27] <i_like_geckos> ty
[13:01:11] <i_like_geckos> Sorry, I haven't got a clue with jQuery
[13:01:21] <i_like_geckos> So, what would the line be?
[13:01:42] <i_like_geckos> Example of my usage is on line 177
[13:02:25] <shoky> scrollTop: $('#portfolio').offset().top - $('#nav').height()
[13:03:18] <i_like_geckos> thanks
[13:16:33] <abailarri> Hello. Anyone can help me? How I can print in the html a ajax response?
[13:16:53] <abailarri> I have this response in json format
[13:16:57] <Velveeta> in your ajax success callback, that's where you'd inject your content
[13:17:25] <abailarri> Velveeta, I know that is in success callaback, but, how
[13:17:53] <Velveeta> well it depends on the way your json response is formatted, and where you want to inject it.. can you make a jsfiddle demo to demonstrate your situation?
[13:19:50] <abailarri> Velveeta, http://jsfiddle.net/97naK/1/
[13:20:19] <abailarri> I can't to recreate 100% because the ajax function interecats with my server
[13:20:24] <Velveeta> abailarri: i need to see a sample of what your json response looks like
[13:20:35] <Velveeta> i know, but you can store a sample of the json response into a variable
[13:20:52] <Velveeta> and we can pretend like it was obtained via the ajax method, and i can show you what you need to know to inject it
[13:21:54] <obi1> Good point, Velveeta
[13:22:50] <abailarri> Velveeta, http://jsfiddle.net/97naK/3/
[13:23:21] <Velveeta> so, what part of that do you want to inject, and where?
[13:23:58] <abailarri> Velveeta, http://jsfiddle.net/97naK/4/
[13:24:54] <obi1> Anybody working on anything?
[13:25:09] <Velveeta> abailarri: but what parts of that are you wanting to inject?
[13:25:23] <Velveeta> i see a bunch of data properties, but don't know which you want to output, i'll just make you a sample
[13:25:35] <abailarri> Velveeta, for this moment all
[13:25:38] <abailarri> all data
[13:29:20] <Velveeta> abailarri: here's an example, with part of your data: http://jsfiddle.net/97naK/10/
[13:29:39] <Velveeta> obi1: anything anything? i'm smoking a pork butt..
[13:33:36] <obi1> LOL
[13:33:55] <obi1> ok, just seeing if anyone is writing some interesting script!
[13:35:35] <abailarri> Velveeta, I tried with this http://pastebin.com/CPEY4RzT and not work. I left something?
[13:35:46] <Velveeta> obi1: oh gotcha, i have a couple of side projects i'm working on in between checking the coals :D
[13:35:57] <abailarri> is the sintax correct?
[13:36:26] <Velveeta> abailarri: yes, your success callback should be receiving your respuesta variable, right now it's not receiving anything
[13:36:37] <Velveeta> you need to add respuesta to your function expression there
[13:37:24] <abailarri> aaaa ok yes, and it is the fisrts question of the problem. Where is the response?How I assing to a var?
[13:38:04] <Velveeta> the response is automatically handed to your success callback
[13:38:29] <Velveeta> your success line should look like this -- success: function (respuesta) {
[13:38:38] <Velveeta> right now it looks like this -- success: function () {
[13:38:49] <abailarri> a its automatic
[13:38:52] <Velveeta> yep
[13:39:09] <Velveeta> when that response comes back, jquery will automatically execute your success function, and will pass the response to it
[13:39:22] <Velveeta> all you have to do is set your callback function to receive it, and then use it inside the function
[13:39:31] <abailarri> yes Velveeta now works.
[13:39:37] <abailarri> thank you very much
[13:39:41] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[13:59:32] <Velveeta> whoa, uncle phil died
[14:17:46] <mdev> I have about 60 text boxes values i need to ajax submit
[14:18:02] <Velveeta> that sounds like a horrible form
[14:18:13] <mdev> what's best/quickiest way to get/send their values, i thought about naming all same id or something
[14:18:24] <mdev> and Velveeta no just lot of information
[14:18:50] <Velveeta> you don't want to name them with the same id, that would be invalid markup, id's are supposed to be unique
[14:18:55] <Velveeta> but you could use the same class name for sure
[14:19:04] <Velveeta> or you could just say $('yourFormId').serialize()
[14:19:14] <Velveeta> as long as those are the only things in your form to be sent
[14:20:15] <mdev> some are checkboxes others are textboxes
[14:20:26] <mdev> err I may just give unique id to each and grab each value
[14:24:53] <mdev> serialize looks promising thanks
[14:24:57] <Velveeta> well, if you do just a $('form').serialize() it'll grab everything
[14:26:04] <abailarri> Velveeta, i'm getting an error that I not found how to resolve. I put this to print a part of the ajax response in a part of my html: cnombre.html('{{ Form::text("nombre", "' + print(nom) + '", array("class" => "form-control")) }}');
[14:26:54] <abailarri> but the result is that in the html prints this ----> the textfield and inside this ---> print(nom)
[14:27:11] <abailarri> when the print(nom) is a print function to print  a bar
[14:27:23] <abailarri> I believe that is  a ' "" ' problem
[14:34:41] <mdev> herm serialize not working
[14:38:05] <nicholasschulz> is there a channel for testers? people who are willing to test your website…?
[14:40:21] <Velveeta> abailarri: that looks like php, shouldn't you be using dots to concatenate instead of plus signs?
[14:40:35] <Velveeta> nicholasschulz: if there is, i don't know what it's called
[14:40:46] <Velveeta> mdev: can you throw up a jsfiddle example?
[14:41:41] <mdev> nah I googled and found the answer
[14:41:46] <Velveeta> ok
[14:41:47] <mdev> Velveeta let me see if you can guess
[14:42:01] <mdev> what the issue was :)
[14:42:10] <Velveeta> your computer wasn't plugged in
[14:42:30] <mdev> lol no
[14:42:36] <mdev> each form element needs a name
[14:43:07] <Velveeta> oh, well, yeah…..
[14:43:24] <Velveeta> otherwise how are you supposed to identify the field in question?
[14:43:25] <abailarri> Velveeta, see.http://pastebin.com/FfYvqe21
[14:43:35] <mdev> lol that wouldn't be common knowledge, I never use names I use id's and classes
[14:44:32] <Velveeta> that's standard html dude… how do you identify your fields when they post to your server?
[14:44:42] <Velveeta> that *should* be common knowledge..
[14:45:36] <Velveeta> abailarri: oh…. wtf…… why are you outputting php code into your web page?
[14:46:24] <abailarri> why?
[14:46:42] <mdev> i use custom posts on.click
[14:46:45] <Velveeta> yes, why
[14:46:51] <mdev> and give them whatever name I want
[14:46:54] <abailarri> because I need to put the respuesta[0] nombre inside a placeholder of form
[14:46:59] <Velveeta> mdev: you've never written a non-javascript form in your life?
[14:47:05] <abailarri> and the form I generate with laravel
[14:47:28] <mdev> Velveeta don't think so
[14:47:44] <mdev> that doesn't go with modern design anyway since without js it redirects
[14:47:58] <mdev> that's ok sometimes, but not awlays
[14:48:10] <Velveeta> mdev: modern design of what, your specific site, or the web in general?
[14:48:16] <abailarri> Velveeta, fixed
[14:48:26] <Velveeta> abailarri: awesome
[14:48:26] <abailarri> I used the normal mode (html)
[14:48:33] <abailarri> not the laravels php mode
[14:48:41] <mdev> web ingeneral if you submit information depending on the site you may not want it to redirect to another page
[14:48:54] <mdev> when the beauty of ajax can take care of it and have you on the same page
[14:49:18] <Velveeta> mdev: yeah, sometimes, sometimes not, but you can redirect with or without ajax, there is no "modern design" that dictates one should be using ajax to submit forms
[14:49:47] <Velveeta> many sites accept both js and non-js submissions, and just let the form gracefully degrade to a typical post if js isn't available
[14:49:47] <mdev> how often do you see modern sites submit forms without ajax?
[14:50:07] <Velveeta> there are still shit-tons of sites out there that still submit forms without javascript
[14:50:33] <mdev> well it works alright in some cases, but more slick with it
[14:50:59] <mdev> no reason modern browser shouldn't have javascript on anyway
[14:51:01] <Velveeta> i would be willing to bet that more do standard form posts than do ajax form posts, actually
[14:51:06] <Velveeta> i would agree
[14:51:18] <Velveeta> but that doesn't change the fact that ajax is by no means "the normal way" to submit forms
[14:51:31] <Velveeta> and even so, you should be naming your form elements for ease of submission
[14:51:49] <Velveeta> so that you can do things like form.serialize(), instead of having to loop through each and every form and use its id value for its form post name
[14:51:52] <mdev> if it's not it will be
[14:52:03] <mdev> and serialize doesn't seem to work for checkboxes
[14:52:06] <Velveeta> i think this is just you trying to make excuses for bad markup
[14:52:37] <Velveeta> serialize should work just find for checkboxes also, but only for those that are checked i believe
[14:52:49] <mdev> you're entitled to your uninformed opinion, sure
[14:53:13] <Velveeta> lol, right, my opinion is uninformed, because i happen to know that form elements should be named
[14:53:16] <grafi_> i am=
[14:53:18] <grafi_> wohooo
[14:54:47] <Velveeta> heya grafi
[14:55:00] <grafi_> hi there
[14:55:26] <grafi_> i have my own opinion ^^
[14:55:32] <Velveeta> please enlighten us
[14:55:59] <grafi_> opinions are like a%%holes
[14:56:02] <DjMadness> i am currently using .mousemove() for detecting where the mouse is in a window, but i want to convert all my code to use .on(), which handler do i use for that ? (ie like .on('click', 'selector', function() {});
[14:56:03] <grafi_> xD
[14:56:43] <Velveeta> djmadness: .on('mousemove', 'selector', function () {})
[14:56:52] <grafi_> magic
[14:57:09] <DjMadness> Velveeta: ah okays, thanks, i was uncertain :)
[14:57:26] <Velveeta> no problem :) converting from those named shortcuts to .on is pretty simple like that :)
[14:57:32] <grafi_> in case of insanity, just try
[14:59:29] <grafi_> hmz
[14:59:33] <grafi_> sherlock started
[14:59:35] <grafi_> wohooo
[14:59:42] <grafi_> 2014 is off to a good start
[15:00:08] <Velveeta> one of my friends on facebook posted "i got called 'sir' 3 times tonight.. 2014 can go to hell"
[15:00:25] <grafi_> hahaha
[15:01:02] <grafi_> is still remember vividly the first time buying alcohol and not getting asked for id, equally insulting :P
[15:01:26] <mdev> serialized post just sends them as individual post entries so while it's a little bit more helpful, not super helpful
[15:01:52] <grafi_> but man, that was a long time ago, soon people are going to be calling me sir ._.
[15:01:53] <mdev> still going to try it out, save me some typing
[15:01:57] <Velveeta> i'm not sure how you expected them to be sent otherwise?
[15:03:33] <mdev> yeah idk, I apologize for being negative just stressed about amount of work I have to get done in a day, i'm sure your opinions are more informed/intelligent than mine for html
[15:03:48] <mdev> I wing things lot of times, I should probably study the standards more
[15:04:18] <grafi> fake it til u make it
[15:04:20] <grafi> :P
[15:04:46] <Velveeta> yeah, even post submissions get converted to standard key/value pairs when they ship to the server
[15:05:03] <mdev> lol grafi
[15:05:04] <Velveeta> if you pass an object of data into a jquery ajax call, it converts it internally to a key/value string, serialize() does it first
[15:05:25] <grafi> mdev are you my linux box? it has the exact same name
[15:05:26] <grafi> :o
[15:05:37] <Velveeta> so if you need to actually modify some of those values prior to shipping, that's when it can be a pain in the ass, because you have to deconvert it, modify it, and reconvert it
[15:25:34] <Blok> I want to $.ajax-access a server using a different port than the one I am on. E.g I am on http://domain.com and want to make an ajax call to http://domain.com:1234. How would I do that properly?
[15:29:30] <shoky> Blok: that's considered a cross-origin request so your server would have to support CORS ideally. jsonp works too
[15:49:37] <hfp> Hi guys! Is there a way to keep the jQuery validation plugin from applying any extra class to the input of the form that didn't validate? It's messing up everything using my boostrap theme by applying .alert.alert-danger classes to the error message AND the input.
[15:54:09] <shoky> hfp: check out the 'highlight' option, you specify exactly what happens to the invalid input
[16:07:47] <hfp> shoky: Thanks
[16:09:07] <hfp> Now the error message is displayed every time I validate with invalid entries without removing the previous one.
[16:09:23] <hfp> So I end up with the error message in double, triple etc
[16:11:35] <shoky> "Now" ?
[16:12:27] <shoky> there's a unhilight option too
[16:14:00] <hfp> I think I'm doing it wrong. I want only the error message to be displayed when the input is not valid. so I put highlight: function() {},
[16:14:37] <hfp> I would expect the unhighlight behavior to be the default one since I didn't touch it, i.e. remove the invalid error message when the field is valid again or when it gets revalidated
[16:15:29] <hfp> But instead, it just keeps on piling up invalid messages. So if I make an invalid input, correct it with another invalid input and again a third time, I end up with the invalid error message in truple
[16:15:34] <hfp> triple*
[16:15:55] <hfp> Would a jsfiddle help or am I clear enough?
[16:17:58] <shoky> hfp: it'd help, since it seems fine here  http://jsfiddle.net/48AX6/
[16:30:08] <hfp> shoky: Is there a fiddle for bootstrap where you can add custom includes? jsfiddle doesn't seem to function with bootstrap
[16:32:54] <shoky> hfp: you just include bootstrap, i think..
[16:38:04] <hfp> It won't take it
[16:38:30] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/48AX6/1/
[16:38:32] <hfp> This is it: http://jsfiddle.net/477Ws/ but for a reason I can't understand, it doesn't even display the error message when it does on my local copy...
[16:39:04] <shoky> your urls are bad
[16:39:08] <shoky> no http://
[16:39:16] <shoky> Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) http://fiddle.jshell.net/477Ws/show/cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-validate/1.11.1/jquery.validate.min.js
[16:39:50] <hfp> Ah thanks, let me fix that and make a proper fiddle
[16:40:56] <shoky> i see the problem
[16:41:35] <shoky> hfp: but it has nothing to do with the highlight option..
[16:42:36] <hfp> Here is a cleaner version with the proper URIs http://jsfiddle.net/477Ws/1/
[16:42:51] <hfp> If you put an invalid entry (i.e. letter)
[16:43:08] <hfp> and come back to it and put more letters, the messages is displayed several times
[16:44:06] <shoky> hfp you can't use multiple classes, i think
[16:45:56] <shoky> yea that's the problem..
[16:46:54] <hfp> shoky: Ah... I feel stupid asking but would there be a way to alias .ultimateError to .alert.alert-danger in my CSS?
[16:47:05] <hfp> Because that would fix it
[16:47:53] <shoky> i don't think so
[16:49:33] <shoky> hm actually looking at the validation plugin code, it does seem to support multiple classes
[16:55:00] <shoky> hfp: seems to work fine if you just remove the text-center class
[16:55:05] <hfp> shoky: It seems to be the problem because when I put only a single .alert class in errorClass, it behaves like it should
[16:56:31] <hfp> Yes when I remove the text-center it works too
[16:59:26] <hfp> The problem seems to be that you can't put more than two classes
[17:01:49] <shoky> yeah, weird shit
[17:03:11] <hfp> I'll open an issue on github
[17:05:51] <shoky> oh
[17:05:56] <shoky> i see where the bug is
[17:06:09] <shoky> link me to your issue, maybe i'll PR it
[17:06:15] <shoky> they have:  var errorClass = this.settings.errorClass.replace(" ", ".");
[17:06:27] <shoky> that's not a global replace, it only replaces the first occurence
[17:07:40] <grafi> wohooo shoky ^^
[17:09:27] <hfp> https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/issues/963
[17:09:28] <shoky> oo https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/pull/280?source=cc
[17:09:30] <shoky> heh
[17:09:42] <hfp> nice one
[17:12:00] <shoky> and there's an open PR for the 3 class version too
[17:12:08] <shoky> https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/pull/884
[17:14:26] <shoky> not nice at all how that plugin finds the error elements
[17:14:55] <shoky> if they did it properly they wouldn't have a dumb issue like that in the first place
[17:15:00] <hfp> From what I understand, it will break again if there are 4 classes even after the pull request?
[17:15:07] <shoky> no
[17:15:13] <shoky> it will be fine for any number of classes
[17:15:27] <shoky> .replace(" ", ".")   only replaces the first occurence
[17:15:39] <shoky> .split(" ").join(".")  would replace all of them
[17:15:47] <shoky> tho i'd prefer .replace(/ /g, ".")
[17:15:48] <hfp> You're right
[17:16:11] <hfp> So I could hack a fix by having errorClass: '.alert.alert-danger.text-center' ?
[17:16:17] <shoky> nope
[17:16:34] <shoky> they're sending that string to .addClass and .removeClass too
[17:16:41] <shoky> which take space-separated classes
[17:18:24] <hfp> I wish I could read the matrix like you do shoky
[17:18:38] <shoky> heh
[17:20:09] <shoky> hfp: here you go, nice lil hack  http://jsfiddle.net/477Ws/3/
[17:21:44] <hfp> Thanks, could you explain how it works please?
[17:22:04] <shoky> exactly how that PR works
[17:22:07] <shoky> by fixing the bug
[17:22:21] <hfp> I don't understand where the .errors comes from
[17:22:22] <shoky> the bug is in an internal "errors" function, which i'm overriding
[17:22:32] <hfp> Ah I see
[17:23:00] <hfp> I wish I could have figured this out by myself
[17:23:15] <tw2113> you can't know everything instantly
[17:23:52] <tw2113> not everyone can be shoky
[17:25:25] <shoky> nope not everyone
[17:25:42] <shoky> it's the shoky exclusion principle
[17:29:11] <Velveeta> i know how fast shoky can come up with a solution, but not exactly where he is when he figures it out..
[17:29:27] <shoky> lol
[17:29:43] <shoky> now you're into shoky uncertainty ;D
[17:32:34] <grafi> shoky should write a book

[17:40:47] <Velveeta> in the last scene of leonardo in titanic, he was sinking, presumably dead.. in the first scene of inception, he washes up on a beach… coincidence? I THINK SO.

[18:33:35] <jnardiello> hi all
[18:35:09] <jnardiello> common reference: i damn hate jquery
[18:35:34] <Eviltwin1> Well then you've come to the wrong place
[19:00:22] <hfp> shoky: I have another one for you!
[19:01:37] <hfp> Same fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/477Ws/4/
[19:03:04] <hfp> When the phone number is valid and you click out of the input, it loses its format (i.e. the text is not centered anymore). This is because when the validation plugin adds the .valid class to the input, it removes anything after the first class. So .text-center is removed.
[19:03:51] <hfp> I tried defining setDefaults({ validClass = '' }), but it still removes anything after the first class.
[19:04:22] <hfp> I suspect the bug is on line 242 of the source file here: https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/blob/bf3cfb234ede2891d3f7e19df02894797dd7ba5e/src/core.js
[19:04:40] <hfp> Because I am guessing the class is removed on the onfocusout event
[19:05:34] <hfp> Could you confirm if my guess is correct? I'd love to fix the bug but I have been staring at the source code, and it has been staring back at me for the last hour and I still don't understand what is happening exactly and how to fix it...
[19:30:55] <Velveeta> hfp: i don't know how married you are to that validate plugin, but i do know that one of my bosses is huge on form validation, and has written his own validate plugin over time, which you can find here: http://jaymorrow.github.io/validatr/
[19:31:04] <Velveeta> maybe you'll have better luck with it?
[19:31:27] <hfp> I would love something else than this plugin, yes. The doc is subpar and it has two very annoying bugs
[19:33:12] <Velveeta> i'm sure it doesn't behave in the same way, so don't expect a drop-in replacement, but i do know that he writes very high-quality code, and has a personal interest in form validation specifically
[19:33:55] <hfp> Thanks. I'll go eat something and try to figure out how to use it after (and probably bug you for help)
[19:34:41] <Velveeta> no problem, but just know i've been drinking, and am torn between the computer and 'man of steel' that i'm watching for the first time, so i'll try to respond if i notice my colloquy bouncing :)
[20:43:42] <raj> awww, thanks shoky

[21:06:36] <bbt> Hi i'm stuck, trying to get the id of img passed back but it isnt doing it. http://pastebin.com/NmgEtPAG
[21:12:31] <bbt> callback is fine with a set value
[21:13:26] <aMoniker> How can I set background-size: 100% auto w/ jquery?
[21:13:37] <aMoniker> it seems to ignore the second value
[21:20:00] <Velveeta> bbt: that code should work for your click event, but not the qtip plugin necessarily
[21:21:36] <Velveeta> amoniker: how are you currently trying to set it?
[23:06:58] <abishek> anybody know of a good jquery date library?
[23:07:01] <elnaz> Why doesn't .delay() work with $('#an_image').delay(2000).css('opacity', '0.7')
