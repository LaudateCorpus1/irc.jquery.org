[00:16:28] <HikaruBG> Hi guys!
[00:16:52] <HikaruBG> any ideas how to build fast and easy responsive GUI?
[00:17:10] <HikaruBG> any ready tools like java-fx?
[00:17:59] <Zak> use web technologies
[00:18:07] <Zak> plenty of things to choose from
[00:18:16] <Zak> depends on your platform too
[00:19:08] <HikaruBG> i use ZF2 on the back end
[00:41:25] <sammych1> I know I shouldn't be surprised
[00:41:34] <sammych1> but why does IE11 not have a native datepicker
[00:42:13] <sammych1> does Windows 8.1 have a datepicker built in like the other mobile OS' do?
[00:44:19] <afroradiohead> alright... So I'm in the midst of solidfying a programming theory and I need some actual input from other developers to speed the process... anyone down to help real quick?
[00:44:53] <afroradiohead> actually, maybe tomorrow, im tired
[00:50:50] <nisseni> should this be working? Or do I have to get the element Id in order to set the css?
[00:54:19] <nisseni> never mind, that's just screwed up. I want to set css based on the data-product-image-id attribute...
[01:12:47] <workerbeetwo> Hey there :) How to set a value for each selected item. In this case Id like to set all "select" elements to "NO".
[01:17:42] <nisseni> workerbeetwo: $('#yourId').prop('selected', false);
[01:17:58] <nisseni> or might be checked, don't remember
[01:18:32] <petzup> hy need little help, i use ajax to post data throught, problem is when i save file then i want to create redirect to other url but problem is because it will redirect inside div and not whole page, how should i solve this problem, here is code http://pastebin.com/6CBFGbhX
[01:20:19] <workerbeetwo> nisseni: no no. its more liek <select> <option> YES</option> <option>NO </option> </select>. the option needs to be set to NO inside of the drop down select element.
[01:20:49] <nisseni> workerbeetwo: you have a value of the option?
[01:21:10] <workerbeetwo> yes
[01:22:05] <workerbeetwo> I think one sets it by index of the option.
[01:22:39] <nisseni> you want to set all the selections to NO?
[01:22:45] <nisseni> you could use each option
[01:32:36] <workerbeetwo> ok thanks. seems to work . need to set the optino now.
[01:39:01] <just2click> Hi ben_alman, are u there?
[01:42:38] <petzup> http://pastebin.com/Te2BVkQZ
[01:42:53] <petzup> save, save-close button is this good solution?
[01:43:05] <petzup> if press save send message, if save-close redirect
[01:49:05] <nisseni> I can't understand why this isn't working: http://pastie.org/private/kbvscjvufnq1yk4bhl87hw - the selectedAltImage is not null
[01:51:22] <d3m0n> Anyone familiar with the jquery.inview plugin? I can't get the "bottom" variable to work http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/tGcgd
[01:51:27] <d3m0n> "Top" seems fine
[02:09:40] <lxsameer> hi, how can i have access to GET parameters which i sent via $.ajax , in .done callback ?
[02:14:21] <ratrace> Hai all. Not sure if this is bug or deliberate. $("x").click(function(){}); catches events propagating inside out, which is as it should be. $(document).on("click", "x", function(){}); catches even propagating outside in! Is this a bug?
[02:14:43] <ratrace> *events
[02:17:19] <doev> when I include jquery.js, there are variables for all tags with id. How is the mechanism behind that called?
[02:18:37] <systemfault> doev: Not sure I understand, can you reexplain?
[02:19:23] <doev> for example, <testabc id="abc"> ... alert(abc) ... => "[object HTMLUnknownElement]"
[02:19:46] <doev> every html-tag with a given id is accesable per variable.
[02:20:30] <systemfault> Does not compute, sorry :/
[02:20:54] <doev> <body id="b"> .... alert(b) ... => [object HTMLBodyElement]
[02:21:06] <doev> without the jquery script, that doesn't work.
[02:23:28] <systemfault> Works everywhere for me… it’s unrelated to jquery
[02:23:47] <systemfault> It’s called: “named access on the window object”, it’s really bad.
[02:24:30] <systemfault> If you care about the details http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#named-access-on-the-window-object
[02:25:57] <doev> my fault, it is jquery unrelated.#
[02:26:16] <doev> systemfault, thx
[02:26:20] <systemfault> You’re welcome
[02:28:05] <petzup> why this doesnt want to check when form is completed which button was clicked : http://jsfiddle.net/CDscN/2/
[02:54:10] <bluesm> Does designing API on servers side that return html. And then replace some part of website with that html string is good way to do it ?
[02:54:43] <bluesm> I think returning JSON and then converting this to HTML form (via DOM methods) is kind of overkill.
[03:24:32] <krambiorix> hi, any idea why won't this work? $('#mytable').find("tr[data-postcalc_code!='']")
[03:26:45] <hayer> Why doesn't this add children? var parent = $('#main').prepend('<div></div>); var child1 = parent.append('<div></div>'); var grandchild1 = child1.append('<div></div>'); ?
[03:28:22] <Ritzton> Hello
[03:28:40] <Ritzton> I would like a responsive modal box in order to display image ? Any advice ?
[03:33:03] <Ritzton> Should I use this library : http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/ or do you know any better ?
[03:38:21] <decx> Ritzton if you want to use a popular lightbox go by github popularity
[03:38:56] <decx> you know why there are about a billion lightboxes? because it's a good excercise to accomplish something pretty straight forward and relatively easy
[03:39:23] <Ritzton> decx> http://plugins.jquery.com/tag/modal/
[03:39:58] <Ritzton> decx> I don't need any lightbox, I need one responsive which is made for displaying an image
[03:40:31] <decx> thats only all of them nowadays isnt it
[03:43:07] <Ritzton> decx> which library are you using for this ? have you made your own ?
[03:44:07] <decx> i've used lightbox2, jqdialog, my own and about 50 that clients installed on their wordpress
[04:05:39] <bl4ckdu5t> when I serialize form data, how can I target specific field from the returned data before sending it to backend
[04:06:05] <bl4ckdu5t> like I have username=foobar&password=easypass&email=me@example.com
[04:06:09] <Pitel_IPEX> http://jsfiddle.net/eC8wK/ bug? try uncommenting the double toggle. what would you expect? the element should be hidden, but it's displayed.
[04:06:18] <bl4ckdu5t> How can I pick just username
[04:09:00] <BillCriswell> bl4ckdu5t: You can do $('[name=username]').serialize()
[04:09:18] <bl4ckdu5t> ok thanks BillCriswell
[04:09:20] <BillCriswell> If it has a class or an id the selector would be better.
[04:09:37] <BillCriswell> $('#user-name') for example.
[04:09:40] <bl4ckdu5t> Pitel_IPEX: It's same with .show().toggle()
[04:10:26] <bl4ckdu5t> yea I'll try to just pick by the name rather than serializing
[04:11:05] <krambiorix> hi, why doesn't this blockui unblock automatically after calling the function ? http://jsfiddle.net/tky4x/
[04:11:06] <Pitel_IPEX> bl4ckdu5t: so, toggle is broken :(
[04:11:14] <bl4ckdu5t> I think
[04:11:23] <bl4ckdu5t> I'm not sure
[04:11:37] <bl4ckdu5t> Maybe it's being used wrongly
[04:12:17] <Ritzton> decx I am trying lightbox2 library and I was wondering how to vertical align the image displayed ?
[04:13:59] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, any idea?
[04:15:16] <bl4ckdu5t> Pitel_IPEX: I think it's wrong to appendTo body after doing the toggle
[04:15:37] <bl4ckdu5t> It goes through the first instructions, and then later obeys append to body
[04:15:44] <bl4ckdu5t> There's no bug
[04:15:44] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: Never worked with that and the demo isn't functional.
[04:16:21] <bl4ckdu5t> Pitel_IPEX: You can put your toggles as a closure inside appendTo body
[04:17:11] <decx> i'd say toggles check is broken on a fragment
[04:17:31] <decx> observe http://jsfiddle.net/decx/eC8wK/2/
[04:17:50] <decx> the ishidden check
[04:18:23] <decx> somewhere here https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/c869a1ef8a031342e817a2c063179a787ff57239/src/css.js#L451
[04:19:29] <decx> maybe it doesnt change the state on a fragment
[04:20:43] <krambiorix> anyone else?
[04:21:04] <bl4ckdu5t> oh I see. Contributors of the jquery development here can see that and they should probably fix it soon
[04:21:18] <decx> file a bug
[04:22:31] <bl4ckdu5t> ok
[04:42:05] <krambiorix> how can i block the screen while a function is being executed?
[04:42:11] <krambiorix> (with a loading icon)
[04:42:38] <decx> an overlay div
[04:43:26] <krambiorix> decx, i did that with a z-index of 1000000 but it's still in the background
[04:44:14] <decx> well make it better than
[04:44:23] <decx> zindex doesnt man anything on its own
[04:44:50] <krambiorix> decx, how can i?
[04:46:09] <airdem> krambiorix, a simple google search will help you much faster
[04:46:11] <airdem> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1964839/jquery-please-wait-loading-animation
[04:47:26] <bl4ckdu5t> krambiorix: If you are setting z-index:1000000 , did you make sure it's absolutely positioned?
[04:47:50] <bl4ckdu5t> or fixed (also absolute)
[04:50:04] <krambiorix> bl4ckdu5t, fixed that was it!!! thanks!
[04:50:24] <krambiorix> thanks all!
[04:50:32] <bl4ckdu5t> uwc
[05:48:02] <yannick_gagnon> Does jquery clean datastore objects when a dom element gets removed?
[06:07:44] <sacho_> datastore objects?
[06:08:19] <yannick_gagnon> sacho_: yes $.data
[06:08:31] <yannick_gagnon> on jquery elements
[06:10:37] <sacho_> if you use .remove()
[06:12:24] <yannick_gagnon> Well, if jquery does not do it, I'd have to do something around DOMNodeRemoved dom event
[06:18:53] <bittyx> Hiya. When documenting my code, is there a preferred/standard way to document the type of jQuery objects? E.g. function foo() { return $(".bar");} would have a @return {Object} in the docblock, but that seems too generic - for example, when using my own "classes", I'd do @return {Foo} and that is much more useful. Googling hasn't yielded any info on this.
[06:18:59] <sacho_> yannick_gagnon, why?
[06:19:29] <sacho_> bittyx, well, you could call it a jquery object.
[06:19:35] <sacho_> or a jquery collection.
[06:20:18] <bittyx> @return {jQuery} might make sense, but it's still a bit too generic - ideally, I'd like to use something like {jQueryElement} or {jQueryCollection} (depending on what I'm expecting that variable to contain/how it's used), and I know I can use whatever I like and it doesn't matter - I was just wondering if there was a convention about this.
[06:20:23] <b-ot> bittyx: liketousesomething.like - ☹☺ MAYBE!
[06:20:54] <bittyx> sacho_: Yeah, something like that is what I'm looking for, just wondering if a consensus exists about it.
[06:22:54] <yannick_gagnon> sacho_: I'm writing a powerpoint like slide player, where code gets evaluated and bound to dom element upon slide loading and I would like those bound object to be destroyed upon dom removal...
[06:24:20] <yannick_gagnon> sacho_: It's just a quick idea for the moment, but I think this would probably need to be based on a convention
[06:24:21] <sacho_> why?
[06:24:27] <sacho_> they'll be GC-ed eventually.
[06:25:38] <yannick_gagnon> well, the thing would run on mobile, where resources are really important
[06:26:39] <sacho_> o..k?
[06:26:47] <sacho_> there's no way to "destroy" an object in js
[06:27:21] <sacho_> you can remove references to it(which is what happens once you remove your dom element), and wait for it to be gc-ed.
[06:28:50] <yannick_gagnon> well remove references to javascript objects bound to the dom element
[06:29:15] <yannick_gagnon> and unbind event handlers from the said javascript object bound to the dom element
[06:30:03] <yannick_gagnon> it's pretty theoritical at the moment, I understand
[06:33:12] <gavit> is there a better way to SELECT than this? http://jsfiddle.net/5z5XV/ I want the on change on all the "input fields of qty and price"
[06:35:00] <sacho_> gavit, use commas to separate selectors and build a single collection
[06:35:26] <gavit> sacho_, isn't there a way to do $("#purchase_order_order_lines_attributes_*_price")?
[06:35:40] <decx> just give them a common class
[06:35:59] <sacho_> gavit, there is, but it'd be significantly slower performance-wise.
[06:36:05] <sacho_> gavit, see the attribute selectors.
[06:36:05] <BillCriswell> Common class is the best options, there are ways around it if you can't do that, though.
[06:36:26] <sacho_> gavit, but instead of asking jquery to do that, why don't you do it yourself?
[06:36:31] <decx> yo BillCriswell what do you think of this implementation http://jsfiddle.net/decx/pNzZz/
[06:37:19] <gavit> sacho_, cause the amount of rows will be generaed by ror
[06:37:33] <BillCriswell> decx: Seems like it's doing a lot?
[06:37:53] <BillCriswell> decx: What would the use case for this be?
[06:37:58] <sacho_> gavit, rows?
[06:38:15] <decx> BillCriswell similar to media queries
[06:38:47] <decx> anytime a breakpoint is reached, something can be executed once inside the resize
[06:38:49] <gavit> sacho_, it's a table which has several rows right?
[06:39:40] <sacho_> gavit, http://jsfiddle.net/5z5XV/2/
[06:39:41] <gavit> BillCriswell, class selectors will also suffer the performance loss sacho_ is talkig about?
[06:39:52] <BillCriswell> gavit: No.
[06:39:53] <sacho_> not really.
[06:40:27] <gavit> sacho_, your array is predetermined, I'll use the class selector instead :) thanks
[06:40:56] <sacho_> uh, well, you can always pass the amount of elements to your js, somehow.
[06:41:03] * sacho_ shrugs.
[06:41:09] <sacho_> adding a class is much better.
[06:42:45] <BillCriswell> decx: I like to keep the breakpoints in the CSS. What do you think about this? http://jsbin.com/qifob/2/edit
[06:44:06] <decx> i think getcomputedstyle is much more heavy than comparing numbers to an array. i wanted something domless
[06:45:01] <decx> well not domless
[06:45:03] <decx> you know ^^
[06:45:22] <BillCriswell> Haha yeah I know.
[06:46:08] <BillCriswell> decx: Have you played with matchMedia?
[06:46:31] <decx> i heard of it
[06:47:25] <decx> it's always at least or less than, not a single "something changed" event
[06:48:02] <BillCriswell> Indeedie.
[06:48:04] <BillCriswell> Shit, brb.
[06:48:08] <decx> i was thinking of replacing img src for different resolutions with this
[06:48:22] <decx> breakpoint reached, one change
[06:53:36] <zuloyd_> hi
[06:54:48] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, that wouldn't be too tough luckily.
[06:55:12] <BillCriswell> The worst part about dealing with the responsive stuff in JS is when plugins beat up the DOM.
[06:56:00] <decx> "oh you are resizing above a certain point, let me change css to the same thing over and over again"
[06:56:32] <BillCriswell> Yeah, that shit can get to be a nightmare.
[06:56:40] <zuloyd_> I'd like to have JQuery try to load a file via Ajax. If it does not find that file, I'd like to load a different file. Now, to do this I can simply put a second ajax request in the error function. But I'd like to fulfill the promise returned by the original ajax request when the second one succeeds
[06:56:41] <zuloyd_> is that possible?
[06:58:27] <decx> some apply magic on when
[07:00:48] <zuloyd_> decx: what kind of magic?
[07:01:06] <decx> if i knew what it did i wouldnt call it magic
[07:06:19] <maxvi> where can I find free image manager for tinymce (jquery version)?
[07:12:01] <decx> zuloyd_ maybe something like this http://jsfiddle.net/decx/cgN5V/
[07:13:03] <BillCriswell> zuloyd_: http://pastie.org/pastes/9412262/text this is my total shot in the dark at what you asked about haha.
[07:13:43] <decx> well at least our code doesnt look the same this time ^^
[07:14:00] <BillCriswell> Haha
[07:14:20] <zuloyd_> :D thank you both
[07:14:32] <zuloyd_> I didn't know you can call .resolve() on a promise
[07:14:36] <zuloyd_> that's actually the easiest way to do it
[07:14:43] <zuloyd_> though I like the recursive version a lot
[07:14:56] <BillCriswell> zuloyd_: I pretty much made it up, it could very well not work at all.
[07:15:13] <zuloyd_> oh
[07:15:16] <zuloyd_> :D
[07:15:28] <zuloyd_> .resolve() is actually a method of a Deferred object, not of a promise
[07:15:33] <zuloyd_> the promise should only be observed, I think
[07:17:36] <BillCriswell> zuloyd_: Yeah I dunno haha
[07:17:54] <BillCriswell> The code looked promising though.
[07:20:34] <zuloyd_> BillCriswell: "promising" :D
[07:21:34] <BillCriswell> This would be a good question for shoky but not sure if he's around.
[07:23:55] <decx> you just have to keep highlighting
[07:24:04] <decx> at some point it's bound to arrive
[07:24:11] <decx> help me shoky one you're my only hope
[07:32:11] <shoky> oi
[07:33:18] <shoky> zuloyd_ BillCriswell you can't resolve a promise/deferred that's already been rejected
[07:35:02] <BillCriswell> Makes sense.
[07:35:23] <shoky> but you can make a new promise, using .then makes it bit nicer e.g.  http://jsfiddle.net/zLC2r/
[07:36:07] <BillCriswell> A ha.
[07:38:35] <BillCriswell> Thanks shoky.
[07:40:29] <decx> that formula for contrast from the yiq colorspace is pretty neat http://jsfiddle.net/decx/RRt3q/
[07:55:39] <BillCriswell> decx: That is nice.
[08:02:00] <nooob> hi just to make sure, $users = User::all(); is that "User" the table name?
[08:02:54] <nooob> wrong forum :D
[08:17:43] <zeroquake> I am setting a scrollTop value for a div and then hiding it . when i unhide it , the scrolltop value becomes zero in IE8 , but in all other browser it gets the value i set before
[08:26:23] <BillCriswell> zeroquake: That sucks. You might need to set like a data attribute or something on the element and when you show it set the scrollTop again with that valud.
[08:26:27] <BillCriswell> with that value*
[08:27:53] <zeroquake> yes , i am going to store the value and restore it back
[08:47:08] <ericx2x> Hey, I check if there is a /index.php at the end of my url by using javascript and make it so that if there is don't do a document ready
[08:47:15] <ericx2x> anyone have any idea on how to do this?
[08:48:33] <ericx2x> nevermind i finally googled it
[08:48:46] <BillCriswell> ericx2x: Sounds messy... You can look at the window.location.pathname and check for index.php at the end of it.
[08:48:47] <ericx2x> or rather found it on google*
[08:50:13] <BillCriswell> path.slice(path.lastIndexOf('/')) === '/index.php'
[08:50:26] <BillCriswell> Having to do that seems very awkward though.
[08:52:29] <thebope> seems very easy to break later on
[08:53:59] <BillCriswell> Absolutely.

[09:36:01] <valentinmu> http://jsfiddle.net/5QywC/
[09:36:39] <valentinmu> i have this kind of layout, and i need to get contents of another block nearby the one i clicked
[09:37:10] <valentinmu> but this "nearby" is quite complicated :)
[09:37:10] <BillCriswell> Sabrina_: What's the issue with noConflict?
[09:37:35] <valentinmu> does anyone know how to solve that?
[09:37:41] <BillCriswell> valentinmu: Where is it?
[09:38:04] <BillCriswell> Oh duh, the comments.
[09:38:11] <valentinmu> http://jsfiddle.net/5QywC/1/
[09:39:06] <valentinmu> BillCriswell: i tryed playing with parents() and siblings() but with no result
[09:39:38] <valentinmu> BillCriswell: the problem is that this pair of tables repeated couple of times in my layout
[09:39:39] <decx> i dont see any relation and only one .sector_name
[09:39:40] <BillCriswell> valentinmu: You can do .closest('table').prev().prev().find('.sector_name') but I think you'd be better off wrapping these in divs.
[09:40:17] <decx> prev().prev() is never a good idea
[09:40:36] <valentinmu> decx: i agree)
[09:40:38] <BillCriswell> That way you can do like .closest('.container').find('.sector_name') instead of the prev().prev().
[09:40:42] <decx> prevAll('table').eq(0)
[09:40:44] <mattalexx> Is there a version of .each() that will allow me to Pass in the element first instead of the hash key? function doSomethingWithP(element) { /* ... */ } $('p').each(doSomethingWithP);
[09:43:52] <valentinmu> BillCriswell: thanks a lot! that did the trick :)
[09:44:04] <valentinmu> decx: thank you too :)
[09:44:15] <BillCriswell> valentinmu: http://jsfiddle.net/5QywC/2/ is what I was typing up at the time.
[09:44:33] <lunks> mattalexx: I think that works
[09:44:34] <CorySimmons> Hey, can I have a function arg show up as a chainable function in jQuery like so? http://pastie.org/9412598
[09:44:42] <CorySimmons> (chartType is the arg/chainable func)
[09:44:55] <CorySimmons> It's not working, and I doubt it will, but any ideas how to accomplish this so anyone could pass in a function name as an arg and it'd produce that kind of chart in ChartJS?
[09:46:36] <mattalexx> lunks: No, it passes "1" to doSomethingWithP()
[09:47:39] <BillCriswell> mattalexx: The first argument is the index, the second is the element.
[09:47:47] <mattalexx> $('p').each(function() { doSomethingWithP(this); }); works, but something like $('p').each(doSomethingWithP);  is what I want
[09:48:18] <BillCriswell> function doSomethingWithP( index, element ) { }
[09:48:38] <mattalexx> BillCriswell: Right, is there a way to pass the element in first so doSomethingWithP doesn't have to cater to the call?
[09:50:40] <shoky> mattalexx: .get().forEach(doSomethingWithP)    :p
[09:51:23] <BillCriswell> That's definitely a way haha
[09:51:31] <mattalexx> uh ..
[09:52:24] <mattalexx> Why isn't that in the docs? No joy googling it
[09:52:45] <shoky> forEach is an Array method. not jquery
[09:52:48] <shoky> .get() returns an array
[09:53:11] <shoky> !mdn forEach
[09:53:13] <b-ot> shoky: Array.prototype.forEach() - JavaScript - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach
[09:56:27] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Awful quiet today.
[09:57:34] <mattalexx> shoky: BillCriswell Thanks
[09:57:39] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell crazy day today!
[09:57:40] <BillCriswell> mattalexx: The only thing with forEach is you have to worry about old IE.
[09:57:53] <mattalexx> How old?
[09:58:01] <BillCriswell> IE8 and below
[09:58:08] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Good or bad crazy?
[09:58:18] <duch_kazatel> educational crazy :)
[09:58:33] <duch_kazatel> putting out some small fires.
[09:58:39] <duch_kazatel> you weren't around yesterday, jerk!
[09:59:03] <BillCriswell> I think I was busy yesterday... don't remember though.
[10:00:01] <BillCriswell> I could go for a nap and bowl of Cocoa Pebbles.
[10:01:08] <BillCriswell> I got 5 emails from recruiters today and it's only 1 o' clock. I know as soon as I don't have a job I'll never see another one.
[10:05:32] <decx> it's because recruiters believe their own bs, in this case 'all unemployed people are lazy'
[10:06:15] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[10:06:44] <decx> what was that stat from a few days ago, 86% of conservatives believe the poor have it easy
[10:07:00] <BillCriswell> I've never been unemployed since high school luckily.
[10:07:05] <BillCriswell> decx: That's a good one.
[10:10:40] <BillCriswell> I mean, I'm sure the super rich have their issues but comparing them to a poor person's is unfair.
[10:11:13] <BillCriswell> Dammit I want a redbull. It's been a week since I had one and I'm trying to keep it going.
[10:11:50] <decx> http://i.imgur.com/zfuhP9v.gif
[10:12:48] <BillCriswell> decx: Damn that's dark haha
[10:13:25] <BillCriswell> If I am any type of "ism" it might be against rich people.
[10:13:42] <BillCriswell> aristocism?
[10:13:46] <BillCriswell> Wonder if that's a thing.
[10:15:36] <decx> being against rich people is as ignorant as the poor people who believe in snake oil salesmen to vote against their own interests
[10:16:24] <BillCriswell> Definitely aware. Can't help it... It could just be rich people I see on TV though haha
[10:16:35] <BillCriswell> Bill Gates is an exception!
[10:16:40] <BillCriswell> Warren Buffet is awesome too.
[10:16:44] <decx> now you know how these actual poor people feel about the west ^^
[10:16:51] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell you're against rich people who don't contribute back to society.
[10:16:52] <gates> bi
[10:16:55] <gates> no*
[10:17:46] <BillCriswell> I might just hate people without the ability to empathize.
[10:17:59] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I'll be... anti-empathizict.
[10:18:09] <decx> you mean bigots
[10:18:15] <pujani> hello everyone, I want to ask that How to use jQuery variable value in php?
[10:18:33] <BillCriswell> decx: That can definitely work.
[10:18:51] <BillCriswell> pujani: Pass them as data.
[10:18:55] <EminenceHC> decx: I really can't decide which side that comic is on.
[10:19:34] <BillCriswell> $.get('foo.php', { foo: "bar" }); then in your PHP script $_GET['foo'] would be "bar"
[10:20:29] <bl4ckdu5t> I never used headjs. Was just reading on it and I'll like someone to kindly help clear the fog for me on it. If a script is required at the <head> and I choose to have all my JS right before </body> does it make it available in <head> on page load even while I have it at bottom
[10:20:33] <bl4ckdu5t> ?
[10:22:35] <decx> wat?
[10:23:06] <decx> scripts block rendering until they are executed, so if you put a script in the head it will execute but it won't know about anything inside body because that hasn't arrived yet
[10:23:31] <duch_kazatel> http://headjs.com/ wtf is this
[10:23:41] <decx> oh that is a thing
[10:23:44] <decx> i though js in head ^^
[10:23:57] <decx> is that like modernizr?
[10:24:05] <BillCriswell> This typography is a sin.
[10:24:25] <duch_kazatel> It's trying to do everything.  why would you use this?
[10:24:45] <decx> oh i thought noscript was blocking the fot but it's actually using comic sans and courier
[10:24:49] <decx> font*
[10:26:13] <BillCriswell> It seems like modernizr for the most part yeah.
[10:27:11] <decx> i want to draw a randomized spiderweb, does anybody know of a good algorithm? at the moment i'm creating hexagons and move points around with math.random
[10:29:27] <BillCriswell> decx: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[10:30:02] <duch_kazatel> well first you need math
[10:30:10] <BillCriswell> Can't forget the math part.
[10:30:28] <duch_kazatel> then you use algorithms or some shit.
[10:30:31] <duch_kazatel> it's real complicated.
[10:30:54] <BillCriswell> You also need to make sure Gwen Stefani doesn't get in the way.
[10:31:16] <duch_kazatel> woah - don't blame her! she's just a girl.
[10:31:39] <BillCriswell> That's all that we'll let her beeeeeeeeee
[10:31:46] <decx> sure the whole thing is complicated, but if i know how to create randomized points in a circular motion then i only need to connect them from the innermost circle to the outer edges, bam i nudged myself closer to the solution without actually understanding what's happening
[10:32:07] <duch_kazatel> don't speak, BillCriswell.  i know just what you're thinking, okay?
[10:32:20] <BillCriswell> I don't tell you cause it hurts.
[10:32:27] <BillCriswell> Tragic kinddom was a fun album
[10:33:01] <BillCriswell> decx: I'm looking at spider webs now and I think I understand how I'd do it but then the math part comes and I'm lost.
[10:33:30] <BillCriswell> decx: Different tightness between each line?
[10:34:04] <decx> the tightness can be simulated with a beziercurve
[10:34:38] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeaaahhhh.
[10:34:52] <BillCriswell> Different spacing between each "row" ?
[10:35:02] <BillCriswell> I hate when I don't know the proper name of something.
[10:35:11] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you need a table.
[10:35:29] <BillCriswell> random defects would be a good time.
[10:35:33] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I do.
[10:35:53] <decx> but if i have a couple of polygons with the same number of segments, then i can connect them between their separate segments
[10:36:41] <decx> i don't think that hexagon + math random thing will work out ^^
[10:37:56] <BillCriswell> I should really get the basics of SVG down so I can at least entertain your questions haha
[10:38:37] <decx> the implementation doesnt really matter though does it, that math behind it is the actual meat
[10:39:58] <BillCriswell> I feel like if I fucked around with it enough I'd figure out the math accidentally.
[10:40:47] <BillCriswell> Over a period of many, many frustrating hours.
[10:43:35] <gavit> Hi, I have class=text-right in my table, but for some reason the numbers don't get aligned correctly under each other :'( They seem left aligned
[10:44:42] <Zzaichik> sounds like css issues
[10:45:49] <gavit> zz_LoRdToLsToI, haha, sorry my bad. I thought I was in #bootstrap :)
[10:46:10] <gavit> not that it seems to exist
[10:46:28] <duch_kazatel> sure it does - i just popped in there.
[10:46:49] <gavit> you popped in ##namespace :p
[10:47:18] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:48:47] <Zzaichik> ##bootstrap for whatever reason
[10:49:16] <gavit> aah, didnt think of that
[10:49:27] <gavit> ## indicates that it's not the official channel
[10:49:30] <Zzaichik> That means "unofficial" bootstrap channel or something doesn't it
[10:49:34] <Zzaichik> yeah that's what I thought.
[10:49:40] <decx> BillCriswell uhm yes... http://jsfiddle.net/decx/e8KZQ/ math !
[10:49:46] <duch_kazatel> ## is a topic channel
[10:49:49] <gavit> Zzaichik, thanks :)
[10:49:50] <duch_kazatel> # is for project.
[10:49:53] <duch_kazatel> *projects
[10:49:57] <Zzaichik> gavit: no probs
[10:50:00] <decx> now to save these points and then connect them afterwards
[10:50:13] <BillCriswell> Just don't forget to carry the 3.
[10:51:04] <Zzaichik> shirley you can't be serious
[10:51:14] <duch_kazatel> of course i am, and don't call me shirley.
[10:51:25] <duch_kazatel> that joke doesn't work when typed out.
[10:52:00] <Zzaichik> *sigh* it isn't as good typed..
[10:52:08] <BillCriswell> The good ones never are.
[10:52:18] * gavit googles the shirley joke
[10:52:34] <decx> i'm a locksmith and i'm a locksmith
[10:52:42] <duch_kazatel> it's from Airplane! - the dude says "surely you can't be serious"
[10:53:15] <gavit> Zzaichik, in case you were interested, the class should be pull-right rather than text-right for some reason
[10:53:16] <Zzaichik> classic
[10:53:26] <Zzaichik> ahh - bootstrap funtimes
[10:53:59] <gavit> Zzaichik, sounds like u dislike bootstrap :P
[10:54:16] <duch_kazatel> he's not alone.
[10:54:39] <gavit> duch_kazatel, how so? it seems ok to me :)
[10:54:47] <gavit> just has some quircks, but nothing is perfect
[10:54:55] <duch_kazatel> it's got a designated fun zone that you can't work outside of.
[10:55:22] <gavit> duch_kazatel, constraints arent a bad thing
[10:55:26] <duch_kazatel> the moment you want to, you're in for headaches.  if i need something small and quick to build an internal tool or something not publicly facing, i might use it.  otherwise it's not worth the headaches.
[10:55:42] <duch_kazatel> they are for me ;)  the grid is okay though.
[10:55:47] <gavit> duch_kazatel, you rather write css from scratch?
[10:55:58] <duch_kazatel> for most things, sure.
[10:56:02] <duch_kazatel> depends on the project.
[10:56:11] <gavit> meh, don't like the way table-striped looks like with a span in it :S
[11:17:24] <decx> BillCriswell http://jsfiddle.net/decx/e8KZQ/2/
[11:20:53] <BillCriswell> decx: bad ass.
[11:22:01] <BillCriswell> decx: Now just the last lines from the center and you're done pretty much right?
[11:22:16] <decx> i just realized it should be the other way around with stable outwards lines ^^
[11:22:35] <decx> that's like a whole other calculation
[11:23:13] <decx> filed away as a learning experience ^^
[11:25:31] <BillCriswell> decx: You mean like the connecting lines get more tight around the inside instead of the outside?
[11:25:41] <decx> right
[11:25:58] <BillCriswell> Got it.
[11:26:06] <decx> if i just connect the point to the point + 20 then it wouldnt hold
[11:26:37] <decx> would probably still look convincing but that's some kind of zero gravity spider probably
[11:27:04] <decx> *+10
[11:27:25] <BillCriswell> I wouldn't trust a zero G spider.
[11:28:36] <decx> "Nasa Astronaut burns down space station" - his comment: "worth it"
[11:30:55] <PantsOfChoco> i came into this conversation at the right time
[11:32:23] <Jattenalle> decx, conundrum, would it be burn "down" in space? or would it simply burn "up"? think about it *strikes a pose as if he said something very deep and profound*
[11:33:03] <decx> the universe doesnt give a shit about physics when there is a zero g spider at loose
[11:34:30] <Jattenalle> :P
[11:36:02] <decx> but yeah, any oxygen that could feed the flame would be sucked out into space as soon as there was a hullbreach, i played enough FTL to know that
[11:37:43] <Jattenalle> ah yes, FTL.. it and KSP, the realistic astronaut training simulators, as opposed to murder simulators that the rest of games are ;)
[11:38:00] <PantsOfChoco> ksp is a murder simulator in my hands
[11:38:02] <decx> for me ksp is a murder sim too
[11:38:05] <duch_kazatel> lol
[11:38:07] <decx> o/
[11:38:15] <Jattenalle> that'sthejoke.jpg ;)
[11:38:37] <BillCriswell> That goat simulator looks amazing.
[11:38:53] <decx> it's cool for like 10 minutes
[11:39:03] <PantsOfChoco> exactly what i expected from it
[11:39:05] <duch_kazatel> unless you're drunk, then it's 30 minutes.
[11:39:13] <decx> sounds reasonable
[11:39:17] <PantsOfChoco> drunk gaming is best gaming
[11:39:29] <PantsOfChoco> pissing off my teammates is destiny is ten times more fun drunk
[11:39:59] <BillCriswell> I miss playing Unreal Tournament capture the flag. =(
[11:40:02] <decx> i cant play modern shooters
[11:40:05] <decx> they aren't quake3
[11:40:24] <duch_kazatel> quake live is good times.
[11:40:33] <decx> soon on steam
[11:40:43] <decx> with some new gameplay tweaks for new players
[11:40:56] <BillCriswell> I played UT99 for so long. I need to play that again.
[11:41:09] <PantsOfChoco> what was the other one
[11:41:13] <PantsOfChoco> newer than 99
[11:41:21] <decx> 2004
[11:41:22] <PantsOfChoco> i feel is the one i played the most
[11:41:23] <PantsOfChoco> yeaaaaa
[11:41:25] <duch_kazatel> 2K3/2K4 and UT3.
[11:41:50] <BillCriswell> Those all felt so slow.
[11:41:55] <decx> i don't like the dodge mechanic
[11:41:59] <decx> strafejumps all day
[11:42:06] <BillCriswell> UT99 is lightning paced the entire time.
[11:42:08] <duch_kazatel> 2003 sucked so they did a patch and un-broke gameplay.  that was 2004.
[11:42:31] <PantsOfChoco> haha i hated lightening fast gameplay i like strategy over run and gun
[11:42:44] <decx> that's not exclusive
[11:42:49] <decx> see quake3/live
[11:42:50] <BillCriswell> decx: Agreed.
[11:43:11] <BillCriswell> I think all first shooters should have shock rifles.
[11:43:20] <decx> you mean railgun
[11:43:31] <duch_kazatel> nah, shock combo = lols
[11:43:34] <BillCriswell> Haha railgun was too easy to use!
[11:43:42] <duch_kazatel> quake 4 was interesting.
[11:43:44] <BillCriswell> Shombos took skill.
[11:43:45] <decx> that's why they nerfed the damage in quakelive
[11:43:55] <decx> from 100 to 80
[11:44:01] <BillCriswell> Especially when you sped up gameplay.
[11:44:05] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha nice.
[11:45:19] <BillCriswell> So much nostalgia.
[11:45:21] <decx> either quake or ut is just so much more responsive, in new military shooters when you kill or get killed you don't feel like it's because of your skill but because you exploited a game mechanic
[11:45:38] <decx> press x to win
[11:45:57] <duch_kazatel> the leveling system doesn't work for me.
[11:46:08] <coby> Hey gents, how do you reference modernizer.js in your html head? I got it to work on JSfiddle like this: http://jsfiddle.net/Ashjf/embedded/result/ but I am having challenges in dreamweaver.
[11:46:22] <BillCriswell> I agree about leveling. I like an equal playing ground throughout.
[11:46:27] <duch_kazatel> well there's your first problem.
[11:46:37] <PantsOfChoco> see i always enjoyed cs for that reason
[11:47:14] <decx> i aint seeing no reference in your script to modernizr checks
[11:47:16] <BillCriswell> I like starting off without weapons, running for a gun and figuring things out from there.
[11:47:30] <duch_kazatel> coby what issue are you having with modernizr?
[11:47:35] <duch_kazatel> in dreamweaver, i mean.
[11:47:57] <PantsOfChoco> ah you were probably a fan of gears of war original then
[11:48:13] <decx> yuk, ue3 input lag
[11:48:23] <decx> might as well play over bluetooth
[11:48:35] <BillCriswell> I did enjoy gears of war, though I felt like it was a giant glitch.
[11:48:57] <duch_kazatel> cobakobodob also, what are you DOING with modernizr?  i'm not actually seeing you use it.
[11:49:14] <duch_kazatel> err, coby.  sorry!
[11:49:26] <PantsOfChoco> oh man the quicksnipe was my favorite thing to do ever, if i was ever actually amazing at a video game it was gears of war
[11:49:39] <coby> duch_kazatel: all I had to do to reference it so the menu would work in jsfiddle was link it in external resouces, but I am trying to figure out how to properly link it in dreamweaver... or any html text editor for that matter
[11:49:54] <decx> when did chrome start to allow transform without prefix?
[11:50:05] <BillCriswell> PantsOfChoco: I hated bleeding out. When you were the last death and people gloated it just annoying me to no end.
[11:50:07] <duch_kazatel> coby you ref it like you ref any other script.
[11:50:23] <coby> like this? <script type="text/javascript" src="http://modernizr.com/downloads/modernizr-latest.js"></script>
[11:50:23] <BillCriswell> it just annoyed*
[11:50:34] <duch_kazatel> coby don't like to the download.
[11:50:41] <duch_kazatel> *link
[11:51:02] <decx> generate a modernizr with the shivs and checks you need and then use that on your server
[11:51:07] <coby> as a matter of good practice for reliability?
[11:51:13] <duch_kazatel> coby both
[11:51:29] <decx> as a matter of hotlinking nettiquette ^^
[11:51:34] <coby> gotcha. Would love too. Just gotta see if it works first.
[11:51:44] <duch_kazatel> the download link is not the one you hyperlink in.  in fact, you should build the one you need and link it locally instead.
[11:52:58] <BillCriswell> I really want to play some UT now.
[11:53:11] <coby> duch_kazatel: what's funny is, when I place that link in JSfiddle it just works. I am trying to properly reference on my local machine.
[11:53:35] <decx> they are building a new unreal tournament btw
[11:53:41] <duch_kazatel> coby don't use that link ever, even when "just testing"
[11:53:43] <duch_kazatel> trust me.
[11:54:49] <BillCriswell> decx: Taking it back to 99 I hope.
[11:55:04] <coby> duch_kazatel: alright, I will download a local copy of it and reference that. Just want to make sure my reference syntax was right though.
[11:55:18] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[11:55:20] <decx> could be, looks like they'll be finished around 2099
[11:55:25] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha.
[11:58:27] <BillCriswell> PantsOfChoco: I liked the bow and arrow thingie.
[11:58:31] <BillCriswell> in GOW.
[11:58:52] <PantsOfChoco> hahaha oh yeaaa
[11:59:20] <PantsOfChoco> see my problem was it was the only game i was really good at, so i did exactly what i would do when it was too easy, and just smoke grenade stick people and run away
[11:59:51] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[12:00:19] <BillCriswell> That game is 8 years old.
[12:00:25] <BillCriswell> I'm getting so old.
[12:00:27] <PantsOfChoco> yea i know it hurts to think about
[12:00:40] <PantsOfChoco> me too my twenties are almost half over.
[12:01:03] <NoiseEee> considering you won't be hitting 30, yeah time to worry PantsOfChoco
[12:01:17] <BillCriswell> I'll be 30 in December.
[12:01:27] <duch_kazatel> if you want to feel old, buy a house.  that freaked me out.
[12:01:36] <PantsOfChoco> hahaha have I said that in here? I always say ill never make it to thirty
[12:01:39] <NoiseEee> sorry i keep telling myself not to show off my clairvoyance
[12:02:13] <NoiseEee> duch_kazatel: TRY RAISING KIDS IN IT!
[12:02:16] <NoiseEee> :P
[12:02:22] <duch_kazatel> nnoooooooo
[12:02:39] <duch_kazatel> (we're starting to talk about that one and that makes me terrified)
[12:03:11] <PantsOfChoco> dont do it until you are old KIDS PREVENT FUN
[12:03:28] <duch_kazatel> yeah i know.
[12:03:54] <PantsOfChoco> wanna go to europe next year? NOPE KIDS. MOVIES? KIDDDDDDDSSSS.
[12:04:13] <PantsOfChoco> or just adopt one thats like ten
[12:04:16] <ericx2x> Hey, can someone help me figure out how to get it so that on the menu I made, when I click on a li element, the entire background color of that li element I selected turns blue? http://jsfiddle.net/erictheprogrammer/TUHP4/1/
[12:04:17] <PantsOfChoco> skip the worst part
[12:04:19] <ericx2x> Example: when you click on north hills north hills turns blue as well its expansion.
[12:05:29] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have a div inside a bootstrap button. Attached a click handler to that div, did stopPropagation on that handler... Chrome catches the click, Firefox and IE do not. What could be the issue?
[12:06:11] <BillCriswell> ericx2x: If you make the li you clicked background's color blue it'll also have a blue background on the ul inside it.
[12:06:47] <ericx2x> BillCriswell: I think that is what I want
[12:07:12] <ericx2x> Try clicking on north hills to get an idea of what I'm trying to do
[12:07:58] <drej> i think you need to change your handle from erictheprogrammer to ericthesupportleech
[12:09:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Why is the button not showing as a bootstrap button? http://jsfiddle.net/zLSv8/ I added the bootstrap.min.js link
[12:09:38] <pujani> BillCriswell: $.get('foo.php', { foo: "bar" }); this not run.
[12:09:46] <duch_kazatel> ecky--ptang-zoob you don't have the css included.
[12:10:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh
[12:10:29] <BillCriswell> pujani: That's not super useful debugging information. Do you have any errors? I know that code on it's own should absolutely work but mixed with other code I can't possibly know the issue.
[12:11:49] <NoiseEee> pujani: how do you know it's "not run"
[12:11:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> So: http://jsfiddle.net/zLSv8/2/ - in Chrome it detects the click and in IE and FF not. Anyone an idea why not?
[12:12:34] <ericx2x> The only thing I can't figure out is how to select the LI element of the menu item i clicked on
[12:12:44] <ericx2x> from there i think i can figure it out
[12:12:58] <NoiseEee> ecky--ptang-zoob: disgusting abuse of <button> perhaps?
[12:13:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ...
[12:13:18] <duch_kazatel> that's not a valid button is it?
[12:13:32] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Why not?
[12:13:34] <NoiseEee> ecky--ptang-zoob: i dont know if its valid, but it certainly would explain why its no good in FF
[12:13:34] <ericx2x> when i click it selects the an a tag, how do i get to the li element that contains that a tag?
[12:13:49] <BillCriswell> ericx2x: .closest('li')
[12:13:51] <NoiseEee> ericx2x: closest()
[12:13:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> What is the explanation?
[12:13:58] <duch_kazatel> ecky--ptang-zoob https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button look at "permitted content"
[12:14:04] <NoiseEee> ecky--ptang-zoob: why are you creating a button like that?
[12:14:04] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: You're parking a garage in the car.
[12:14:21] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell++
[12:14:23] <decx> that's a funny expression
[12:14:27] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I need that functionality, the inside of the button has to be editable by a user inline
[12:14:39] <NoiseEee> yeah sorry ecky--ptang-zoob
[12:14:42] <duch_kazatel> you cannot do that.
[12:14:51] <ecky--ptang-zoob> :(
[12:14:59] <ecky--ptang-zoob> you sure?
[12:15:09] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Interesting link.
[12:15:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> If chrome can handle it... should be possible then?
[12:15:15] <duch_kazatel> no.
[12:15:20] <duch_kazatel> chrome is not following spec.
[12:15:32] <ecky--ptang-zoob> So how to work around this then?
[12:15:34] <BillCriswell> You can put a <video> in the button lol
[12:16:04] <BillCriswell> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#Phrasing_content never even heard of this term.
[12:16:05] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I need a dropdown button and something editable inside it
[12:16:17] <duch_kazatel> then you can't use a button.
[12:16:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> can I use a link?
[12:16:41] <duch_kazatel> links can't have divs inside of them techically.
[12:16:45] <duch_kazatel> you can use a div
[12:16:55] <drej> duch_kazatel thats  been changed
[12:17:00] <duch_kazatel> drej what has?
[12:17:03] <drej> html5 its entirely valid to wrap an anchor around a block element
[12:17:04] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but if I use a div i can't use bootstrap's dropdown menu
[12:17:09] <alexut> i have some errors when loading all the jquery plugins i'm trying to use... all return "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function"
[12:17:10] <drej> <a href=""><div> ... </div></a>
[12:17:10] <BillCriswell> html5 allows <a><div></a>
[12:17:15] <drej> ^
[12:17:23] <BillCriswell> Still feels icky to me, but it's cool haha
[12:17:24] <duch_kazatel> interesting.  good to know.
[12:17:29] <duch_kazatel> ecky--ptang-zoob you cannot have both.
[12:17:30] <drej> yeah, i always feel gross when i do it
[12:17:31] <alexut> anyone can hint me in the right direction to fix this?
[12:17:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> If the client wants both...
[12:17:50] <duch_kazatel> ecky--ptang-zoob you have to custom write it.
[12:18:15] <duch_kazatel> alexut make sure jquery is the first thing getting loaded.
[12:18:18] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Okaria, you're absolutely 100% sure there is no "hack or fix" for this?
[12:18:19] <BillCriswell> alexut: What's on the line the error mentions?
[12:18:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok*
[12:18:40] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: If you showed a picture of what you're going for it might be easier help wise.
[12:18:56] <duch_kazatel> ecky--ptang-zoob i am absolutely 100% sure that you should not use a "hack or fix" for something as fragile as relying on broken browser behavior.
[12:19:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> i'll make a pic
[12:19:50] <alexut> BillCriswell : it's right before the plugin begins, all the jquery plugins from the footer have the error, the one in head don't
[12:20:56] <duch_kazatel> alexut i'd have to see the error in action.
[12:21:04] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you've got an invalid thing going on.
[12:21:14] <BillCriswell> Word.
[12:21:27] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Here is the functionality I need: http://i.imgur.com/wnDOvGP.jpg - the button is a dropdown, but also when user clicks on "famous actor" a textbox appears in which he can change that text
[12:22:10] <duch_kazatel> ecky--ptang-zoob you want a tooltip
[12:22:22] <duch_kazatel> said tooltip content shouldn't be a child of the button.
[12:23:17] <ecky--ptang-zoob> tooltip?
[12:23:21] <ecky--ptang-zoob> with links inside?
[12:23:25] <hlvwrk> tip that's a tool
[12:23:30] <duch_kazatel> check out powertip.
[12:23:36] <duch_kazatel> there are a few other libraries out there.
[12:23:52] <duch_kazatel> you could also write your own in this case.  but you don't need your editable content to be a child of that button.  that's silly.
[12:24:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but that's for text inside a tooltip... it has to be a menu with links...
[12:24:36] <duch_kazatel> none of what you're doing requires the editable to be a child of the button either way.
[12:24:59] <ecky--ptang-zoob> how can I make it show inside the button if it's not a child element..?
[12:25:24] <duch_kazatel> lol you're thinking about it all wrong.  you'll have to custom write some stuff, but i'll show you a simple example./
[12:25:38] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: http://getbootstrap.com/components/#btn-dropdowns
[12:25:38] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[12:25:54] <ecky--ptang-zoob> <BillCriswell> - you kidding me? ;)
[12:25:59] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell that won't work.
[12:26:09] <BillCriswell> Why wouldn't it?
[12:26:10] <duch_kazatel> oooh nvm.
[12:26:12] <duch_kazatel> yeah it would.
[12:26:26] <duch_kazatel> didn't look at the <ul> example ;)
[12:26:32] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[12:26:36] <blakespot> Can you reference $("#element:hover").css(... ?
[12:26:39] <ecky--ptang-zoob> that's whaty im currently using
[12:26:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> dropdown menu in an UL
[12:26:49] <duch_kazatel> ecky--ptang-zoob you can use that but not use the button.
[12:27:01] <BillCriswell> I am so lost.
[12:27:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so I just need to display that UL - when click on the custom div i make?
[12:27:21] <duch_kazatel> ecky--ptang-zoob show us what you have again.
[12:27:33] <duch_kazatel> blakespot nope.  you chould do that in your CSS anyway.
[12:27:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> This I need: http://i.imgur.com/wnDOvGP.jpg
[12:27:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> "famous actor" is editable INLINE
[12:27:43] <duch_kazatel> ecky--ptang-zoob show us that fiddle again.
[12:28:01] <alexut> duch_kazatel site with the errors i'm working on is here: http://hindged.com thanks.
[12:28:10] <ecky--ptang-zoob> http://jsfiddle.net/zLSv8/2/
[12:28:22] <blakespot> duch_kazatel: I have some #element:hover behaviors defined in CSS but I want to render them inactive if I detect mobile
[12:28:26] <duch_kazatel> ecky--ptang-zoob now look at the bootstrap page again - notice the difference?
[12:28:35] <duch_kazatel> blakespot then use media queries.
[12:28:48] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Yes I know, the UL is below the button - but I also have that in my code!
[12:28:54] <ecky--ptang-zoob> just not in the jsfiddle
[12:28:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it doesnt change the problem
[12:29:01] <blakespot> right - makes sense
[12:29:46] <duch_kazatel> ecky--ptang-zoob it DOES change the problem - the example on the boostrap site uses the UL, no button.
[12:30:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> here: http://jsfiddle.net/zLSv8/3/
[12:30:12] <duch_kazatel> 1-55-167.w82-121.abo.wanadoo.fr) Quit
[12:30:12] <duch_kazatel> [2014:07:22:12:28:34] <duch_kazatel> blakespot then use media queries.
[12:30:12] <duch_kazatel> [2014:07:22:12:28:48] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Yes I know, the UL
[12:30:14] <duch_kazatel> woops.
[12:30:23] <ecky--ptang-zoob> the example on the site uses a button which displays a UL
[12:30:24] <duch_kazatel> sa.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://cdn'; : 'http://cdn') + '.ywxi.net/js/1.js'; - that's not a valid statement alexut
[12:30:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> just like I have , the dropdown in my pic is a UL
[12:30:49] <ecky--ptang-zoob> "famous actor" must display inside the button
[12:30:59] <duch_kazatel> ecky--ptang-zoob i give up - you're not listening.
[12:31:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I try to understand what you mean
[12:31:48] <coby> ecky--ptang-zoob: that fiddle is interesting. The menu after click appears far below on my browser (Chrome). i had to scroll down to see it.
[12:32:07] <duch_kazatel> alexut you want sa.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://cdn' : 'http://cdn') + '.ywxi.net/js/1.js';
[12:32:18] <duch_kazatel> and try to get all that JS into its own file instead.
[12:34:21] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: Why do you want that to be a dropdown
[12:34:26] <BillCriswell> to be a button*
[12:34:51] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so people know it's clickable to launch a dropdown
[12:35:26] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I could make a div, but then I need to style it like a button, seems stupid
[12:35:27] <duch_kazatel> you can communicate that in other ways.
[12:35:42] <BillCriswell> background-color: #eee; border-radius: 5px;
[12:36:01] <BillCriswell>  background: #eee url("down-arrow.png") no-repeat right;
[12:36:12] <duch_kazatel> bingo
[12:36:14] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but it IS a button, so I hate using a div when there is an actual button html element
[12:36:53] <NoiseEee> sounds like the club is saying 'dont use a button element' but whatevs
[12:36:54] <BillCriswell> buttons aren't very flexible with it's children it seems.
[12:36:55] <duch_kazatel> it's not a button imo.
[12:37:02] <alexut> thanks duch_kazatel but still it didn't solved the problem i was complaining about, the <<Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function>> . i tried for 3 hours to solve this, any hints in that direcation ?
[12:37:05] <duch_kazatel> and a button cannot give you what you want.
[12:37:07] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Okaria, i'll do it that way then, ty
[12:37:15] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok*
[12:37:36] <ecky--ptang-zoob> what a waste of time to make a stupid simple button
[12:37:36] <duch_kazatel> alexut did you fix that error?
[12:37:41] <alexut> yea
[12:38:17] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: Agreed. Form elements are rarely ever fun.
[12:38:30] <BillCriswell> They are 1,000,000 better than they were back in the early 00's.
[12:38:44] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Laravel makes them SLIGHTLY more fun than awful
[12:38:52] <duch_kazatel> alexut <style type="text/css">PICK AN ELEMENT NOW - or type CSS selector(advanced) { that's not valid CSS
[12:39:06] <BillCriswell> http://www.particletree.com/features/rediscovering-the-button-element/ I remember I thought this was INCREDIBLE at the time because of how terrible cross browser issues were.
[12:39:20] <duch_kazatel> alexut you have 2 versions of jquery on this page.
[12:39:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> lol BillCriswell - yeah what a nightmare that was
[12:40:56] <BillCriswell> Aw shit jsbin has scss now.
[12:41:02] <BillCriswell> Well, it may have been there for a while.
[12:41:06] <BillCriswell> I'm just usually late to the party.
[12:41:06] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle's had it for a long time :cooldude:
[12:41:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> you don't like sass?
[12:41:34] <iamviknesh1> i dont want the event on particular element to occur continuously , however it can occur after user interacts with other elements , i saw  .one() , but it removes the handler once the vent occured
[12:41:42] <BillCriswell> I prefer the scss syntax.
[12:41:48] <duch_kazatel> scss is baller
[12:41:52] <iamviknesh1> s/vent/event
[12:41:58] <duch_kazatel> iamviknesh1 huh?
[12:42:02] <NoiseEee> iamviknesh1: track the event somewhere
[12:42:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yeah isn't that the default now? I never used .sass
[12:42:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> always .scss
[12:42:41] <iamviknesh1> duch_kazatel: sorry , what ?
[12:43:07] <iamviknesh1> NoiseEee: any guide on how to do ?
[12:43:14] <duch_kazatel> iamviknesh1 you can't control if the event fires.  you can control bindings to those events from firing, though.
[12:43:37] <duch_kazatel> you can include that in your logic, or use data attributes, or do all kinds of other things.  do you have a fiddle showing what you're trying to do?
[12:44:01] <iamviknesh1> duch_kazatel: nope , will create now :)
[12:46:45] <alexut> duch_kazatel : thanks for trying to help, can't find the duplicate jquery.js file you tell me about.
[12:47:43] <alexut> duch_kazatel : found it, thanks...
[12:47:54] <duch_kazatel> get rid of the old version.
[12:47:55] <duch_kazatel> start there.
[13:23:24] <iamviknesh1> duch_kazatel: here it is http://jsfiddle.net/Ar55e/
[13:25:28] <iamviknesh1> duch_kazatel: i want the click event to not occur continuously for same id :)
[13:31:13] <heihei> Anyone use summernote? Having problems getting Django to save anything from a textarea after I call summernote on it.
[13:32:32] <iamviknesh1> duch_kazatel: there ?? any idea , how would i do it ?
[14:00:04] <wanderingi> I'm getting the following error in ie8, could someone give me some indication as to how to resolve it? jquery.media.js browser.mozilla is null or not an object
[14:00:53] <systemfault> wanderingi: You probably updated your jQuery version and newer jQuery versions don’t support the $.browser
[14:01:13] <systemfault> I think you can use jquery migrate if you still need that crap
[14:07:49] <duch_kazatel> don't use browser detection if you can avoid it.
[14:10:40] <wanderingi> What does that mean? I don't know what's causing this issue so don't know how to fix it via any browser detection
[14:11:06] <duch_kazatel> wanderingi do you have a place you can show us where this is happening?
[14:11:26] <duch_kazatel> iamviknesh sorry, i was out getting lunch.
[14:11:30] <wanderingi> www.denn-ex.com only happens in ie8
[14:12:02] <jailbot> hey
[14:12:10] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: no problem , check it when you are free :)
[14:12:16] <jailbot> i’m using fadeOut to remove elements
[14:12:29] <jailbot> and it causes the bottom of the page to jump up
[14:12:37] <jailbot> how would you prevent this?
[14:13:18] <duch_kazatel> wanderingi $.fn.media.defaults.players = { is the problem.  looks like it has a bug.
[14:14:15] <wanderingi> is this only for swf files as i dont use them on the site.
[14:14:45] <duch_kazatel> wanderingi all i know is that plugin has the bug.  no idea what the fix would be in this case short of updating.  what version of jquery are you using?
[14:14:57] <duch_kazatel> iamviknesh so what specifically are you looking for?
[14:15:29] <wanderingi> should be the latest, I use the link code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js
[14:15:44] <duch_kazatel> that's a bad ide.a
[14:15:54] <duch_kazatel> and also: http://blog.jquery.com/2014/07/03/dont-use-jquery-latest-js/
[14:17:12] <duch_kazatel> so first off find an actual CDN link for a version of jquery, and then you should probably update that plugin.  start there and see where that gets you.
[14:17:39] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: you can find i have attached the click events to many id's . So , i dont want the event to trigger continuously on same id , however after clicking on anyother id's . it can
[14:17:40] <duch_kazatel> iamviknesh oh, i remember this - put your handlers in your js.  don't inline them like that.
[14:18:00] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: yeah :)
[14:18:03] <duch_kazatel> fix that first.
[14:18:31] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: i fixed it , i added it to js
[14:18:57] <duch_kazatel> that's not the right way to do that, and you need to fix your HTML.
[14:19:07] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: sorry i dint update my html
[14:19:14] <iamviknesh> though updated the js
[14:19:18] <iamviknesh> will do now
[14:20:43] <duch_kazatel> one sec, let me show you the right way to do something like this.
[14:21:53] <duch_kazatel> what are these buildForString and other functions about?
[14:22:01] <duch_kazatel> because you're doing this in the most painful way possible.
[14:22:31] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: new link http://jsfiddle.net/N9bdy/
[14:22:48] <duch_kazatel> lol you killed your html - just answer my question :)
[14:23:31] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: i creating a app like http://goo.gl/9aasx7
[14:23:51] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't answer my question, but one sec.  let me show you the easier way to do this.
[14:24:36] <iamviknesh> which displays the C program based on what u select like , if u select String from the menu , display all C program based on String
[14:25:29] <iamviknesh> so thats what buildForXXX() does , it generates the list of program based on what user selects from the menu
[14:25:57] <duch_kazatel> you're coupling your logic to your data too much.
[14:26:40] <iamviknesh> and i have a another problem , that generated list dont have jquerymobile features applied
[14:26:44] <duch_kazatel> hold up.
[14:26:48] <duch_kazatel> one thing at a time.
[14:27:10] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: ok no problem , i will :)
[14:27:40] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I'm curious as to why this event isn't being triggered when I select an option from my phone. Using a 'touch' event doesn't work either - https://www.refheap.com/88469
[14:28:14] <decx> no idea if i understand that but use jqms built-in methods to load content dynamically iamviknesh
[14:29:14] <decx> why do you catch a click on an option DeltaHeavy and not just change on its select
[14:29:35] <DeltaHeavy> decx: Let me try that
[14:29:40] <decx> also i doubt that an option can have a p sibling
[14:30:05] <iamviknesh> decx: u mean this http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.1.1/docs/pages/page-dynamic.html
[14:30:21] <DeltaHeavy> decx: That worked. Not sure why I derped
[14:30:22] <decx> i dont do jqm, maybe iamviknesh
[14:31:24] <iamviknesh> decx: ok fine :) thanks , will look into it
[14:35:54] <xelra> Finding a tutorial on how to make a parallax effect is a real pain. Google is full of results with "use my plugin" stuff. But I thought it's supposed to be easy and just a few lines of code. Does anyone have a real jquery or javascript tutorial for it?
[14:38:19] <frank_o> xelra: Have you tried https://github.com/wagerfield/parallax?
[14:38:29] <coby> Ok, I blieve I have a serious modernizr issue. Here everything works in JSfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Ashjf/ but here everything does not work: http://liveweave.com/Xmj3DH ane I even included modernizr in the head of the html.
[14:38:29] <frank_o> It's the only parallax plugin in my book.
[14:38:44] <systemfault> xelra: http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/07/12/behind-the-scenes-of-nike-better-world/
[14:39:04] <DeltaHeavy> xelra: I've been using stellar.js with great results.
[14:39:06] <frank_o> Also there was one guy in here who made his own parallax piece from scratch. Damn, forgot his name.
[14:39:59] <frank_o> DeltaHeavy: parallax.js has 4000 more stars on github though
[14:40:25] <decx> you move a couple of images around relative to each other
[14:40:48] * DeltaHeavy shrugs
[14:41:07] <decx> where is it...
[14:41:13] <duch_kazatel> coby we explained this earlier.
[14:41:17] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/mfpqY/
[14:41:32] <frank_o> lol
[14:41:47] <coby> duch_kazatel: Yes and I even tried the local version. No progress.
[14:41:55] <frank_o> decx you are awesome.
[14:42:24] <frank_o> sorry for my short-term memory.
[14:42:26] <coby> Why does JSfiddle load it up fine but not LiveWeave, even when I specifically chose the modernizr addon from their menu?
[14:42:31] <duch_kazatel> coby you can't link to your local version on your desktop on that site.
[14:42:36] <duch_kazatel> and what is liveweave?
[14:42:39] <coby> duch_kazatel: I didn't
[14:42:47] <coby> I'm not that N00bish
[14:42:48] <coby> :)
[14:43:01] <duch_kazatel> sounds like your problem is with liveweave, then.
[14:43:18] <xelra> Thanks guys.
[14:43:29] <xelra> Thanks systemfault. That's what I was looking for.
[14:43:59] <coby> I put it on liveweave hoping it would work like JSfiddle does, while also giving me proper syntax for the head script ref. Alas, it is as broken as my local attempts on Dreamweaver.
[14:44:18] <duch_kazatel> http://liveweave.com/hNUBO4
[14:44:28] <duch_kazatel> you need to include jquery AND modernizr for what you're trying to do.
[14:44:37] <duch_kazatel> and stop using dreamweaver.
[14:45:02] <duch_kazatel> you'll thank me later :)
[14:45:06] <coby> duch_kazatel: dreamweaver is great. :D I test everything in browsers though.
[14:45:21] <coby> and I tweak a lot in browser.
[14:45:27] <duch_kazatel> :(
[14:45:46] <DeltaHeavy> Having an issue similar to my last, same event. alert() isn't firing even though I'm changing the select box. When I comment out the declaration of 'lbl' it works fine, but I'm unsure why it's running into issues. I ran it from the console and just replaced 'this' with x from '$('#car-make')' and it worked fine. Anybody nkow what's wrong here? - https://www.refheap.com/88470
[14:46:20] <coby> duch_kazatel: that was it? Simply include the latest version Jquery? Well thank you very much.
[14:46:30] <duch_kazatel> that should do it.
[14:47:06] <DeltaHeavy> And even when I do comment out 'lbl', the event only fires once
[14:47:12] <DeltaHeavy> Actually crap, I think it's just Chrome's mobile cache
[14:49:32] <duch_kazatel> vagrant is amazing.
[14:49:49] <DeltaHeavy> nvm, it's not the cache. No idea why it's doing this =/
[14:50:38] <duch_kazatel> and you're not getting any js errors?
[14:50:57] <xelra> How does this stuff (parallax) behave in mobile browsers? I've read somewhere that it's a pain, because mobile browsers execute js delayed. True?
[14:53:25] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy you're that dude in the crazy IE environment, right?
[14:53:39] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: Nope
[14:53:45] <DeltaHeavy> Maybe a year ago lol
[14:53:49] <duch_kazatel> okay. http://jsfiddle.net/gj35a/
[14:53:55] <duch_kazatel> this should work.
[14:54:59] <ilgio> hello
[14:55:14] <systemfault> xelra: I never had to do it for mobile but I could see rendering being an issue… unless you’re being really careful and just use 3d transforms and rAF
[14:55:25] <ilgio> in query mobile why doesn't work document.ready???
[14:55:38] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy http://jsfiddle.net/gj35a/3/
[14:55:40] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: It's the same no?
[14:55:43] <DeltaHeavy> Lemme check
[14:55:55] <DeltaHeavy> Ah true, that's a much better selector
[14:55:56] <duch_kazatel> that's the cleaner way to get the selected text.  and yes, it's the same, but it works in the fiddle.
[14:56:15] <DeltaHeavy> I think I have another event interfearing
[14:56:22] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[14:56:28] <DeltaHeavy> Might just rewrite this whole bit cause it's gotten fairly messy.
[14:56:47] <ilgio> please help me
[14:57:31] <ilgio> in jquery mobile why doesn't work document.ready???
[14:57:40] <duch_kazatel> ilgio it does.
[14:57:47] <duch_kazatel> share some code.
[14:58:16] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: any  suggestion , oh how do i do it ?
[15:00:07] <iamviknesh> s/oh/on
[15:01:09] <duch_kazatel> i thought I pasted my example./  i guess not!  one sec.
[15:02:01] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: link please ?
[15:02:01] <duch_kazatel> wait, decx told you what you needed to do.
[15:02:41] <duch_kazatel> that's why i didn't paste it.  don't build content like this.  use jqm to do it the way it normal does.
[15:02:57] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: yeah told to load page dynamically
[15:03:11] <duch_kazatel> right.
[15:03:27] <duch_kazatel> i'm not terribly familiar with jquery mobile, but start reading those docs.
[15:03:30] <duch_kazatel> it's pretty easy iirc.
[15:04:17] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: basically , i just know only js , havent learned jquery though . i thought of learning by creating this app
[15:04:25] <duch_kazatel> then do it.
[15:04:32] <duch_kazatel> asking me to do it for you won't help you learn.
[15:05:03] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: sorry , i dint ask you to do . i just asked how can i do :(
[15:05:09] <duch_kazatel> by reading the docs.
[15:05:13] <duch_kazatel> what you want to learn is in the docs.
[15:07:24] <ilgio> http://www.agriturismosacanudera.it/temp/HPLC/home.html
[15:07:56] <ilgio> to click doesn't not run the document.ready
[15:07:57] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: i was looking the doc and found .one() which does that , but i want the event not to occur continuously , so i came here  to ask , how can i do it
[15:08:21] <ilgio> while the thermo reload it work
[15:08:23] <ilgio> why?
[15:08:41] <duch_kazatel> iamviknesh we told you how, but that's not the right way to do what you want.
[15:08:46] <frank_o> iamviknesh: from what i know jquery mobile uses http://api.jquerymobile.com/pagecontainer/ instead of document ready
[15:09:09] <duch_kazatel> ilgio iirc you need to init the page.
[15:09:27] <ilgio> ?
[15:09:46] <ilgio> what?
[15:09:47] <duch_kazatel> it's jquery mobile.
[15:10:02] <duch_kazatel> i can't remember, but don't you have to do some weird magic funk to get things to work right?
[15:10:23] <ilgio> how to resolve my problem?
[15:10:51] <iamviknesh> duch_kazatel: frank_o thanks :)
[15:13:03] <duch_kazatel> ilgio i'm not really familiar with jquery mobile, but iirc there's some magic to get things working.
[15:13:36] <frank_o> iamviknesh: so `$(document).on('pagecreate', function() {` by default or `$(document).on('pagecontainershow', function() {` if you need to do stuff (ie. measure sizes) after everything is visible
[15:13:50] <duch_kazatel> i think you mean that for ilgio yeah?
[15:14:39] <frank_o> iamviknesh: jquery mobile's "reality of multiple pages" is real confusing though
[15:15:04] <iamviknesh> frank_o: yeah was going through the docs
[15:15:25] <ilgio> boo
[15:15:34] <ilgio> i don't know
[15:15:36] <ilgio> :(
[15:18:50] <obert> duch_kazatel: you meant like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5622581/jquery-mobile-document-ready-equivalent
[15:19:02] <duch_kazatel> sure why not.
[15:19:07] <duch_kazatel> (i have no idea)
[15:19:22] <ilgio> obert ;)
[15:19:25] <obert> duch_kazatel: i was talkin about ilgio issue
[15:19:33] <duch_kazatel> i know.
[15:19:46] <duch_kazatel> i really don't know much about jquery mobile other than it's got a lot of magic and woo going on sometimes.
[15:21:51] <obert> thanks duch_kazatel
[15:25:21] <frank_o> i just hope jquery mobile gets simplified
[15:25:26] <duch_kazatel> it is, actually.
[15:25:30] <frank_o> less theme-based
[15:25:37] <duch_kazatel> that's exactly what they're doing with it.
[15:25:38] <frank_o> yup
[15:25:55] <frank_o> let that be a lesson to all you jquery mobile haters out there :)
[15:26:12] * duch_kazatel waves
[15:28:05] <systemfault> The whole idea of having other projects share the jQuery name is bad IMHO
[15:28:19] <systemfault> jquery-ui and jquery-mobile should have their own channel.
[15:29:26] <frank_o> systemfault: #jqueryui-dev is a well-kept secret though
[15:29:30] <frank_o> all the jqm devs are there
[15:30:13] <coby> duch_kazatel: here's an idea... I am using wampserver 2.2 and haven't updated in a while. What would you recommend instead of Dreamweaver?
[15:30:20] <duch_kazatel> anything.
[15:30:35] <coby> duch_kazatel: what do you like to use? I am on Windows PC btw
[15:30:48] <duch_kazatel> i use sublime text.
[15:30:56] <duch_kazatel> that + my dev tools are all i need
[15:31:39] <coby> that looks super awesome
[15:31:59] <duch_kazatel> i also used notepad++ for years
[15:32:23] <coby> what dev tools do you like to use?
[15:32:38] <coby> Asking because I am in a job transition and want to prepare
[15:32:42] <duch_kazatel> right now i'm using the native FF ones.
[15:32:47] <duch_kazatel> the chrome ones are good, too.
[15:32:51] <coby> Like FireBug
[15:32:53] <duch_kazatel> hell, IE11s are great, too.
[15:32:58] <duch_kazatel> yeah, each browser has native ones.
[15:33:01] <Ansikt> The chrome ones are more powerful in almost every way
[15:33:01] <coby> oh yeah :)
[15:33:09] <Ansikt> But for some reason I like firefox's much more
[15:33:12] <Ansikt> I don't know why
[15:33:20] <duch_kazatel> i used firebug for years until they became too funky.
[15:33:25] <coby> Chrome's are all buit-in right? or are there separate add ons/extensions that you guys would recommend?
[15:33:38] <duch_kazatel> chrome's are built-in
[15:33:55] <Ansikt> I install "Chris Pederick's web developer toolbar" on FF and chrome.  That and the native tools are usually all I need.
[15:34:05] <duch_kazatel> i have JSONView installed in FF>
[15:34:23] <duch_kazatel> also HttpFox can be helpful.  ColorZilla is a good one.
[15:34:40] <Ansikt> Oh yeah. +1 ColorZilla
[15:34:59] <tw2113> Firefox Dev tools, at the version i have, have a color picker built in now
[15:35:06] <tw2113> but i run alpha
[15:35:13] <tw2113> so it's coming in a future release for those on stable
[15:35:19] <Ansikt> And I DO actually have firebug installed...usually only have it for the Firebug plugins.
[15:35:34] <duch_kazatel> i used to use firebug, but the native tools have everything i need at this point.
[15:35:37] <coby> Ansikt: that sounds good :D
[15:35:57] <tw2113> i really don't have a lot of addons for webdev any more
[15:36:37] <tw2113> split console, scratchpad, color picker, screenshot button, 3d view, responsive view
[15:36:41] <Ansikt> The webdev toolbar I use.  Easy way to clear cache and cookies, plus ruler and a bunch of other stuff.
[15:36:57] <coby> what about wampserver?
[15:36:58] <tw2113> i do have chris's toolbar still, but i leave the regulated to context menu
[15:37:04] <Ansikt> I think I used the 3D view once, went "huh, that's cool" and then never touched it again.
[15:37:08] <coby> great suggestions guys, I am taking notes :)
[15:37:09] <duch_kazatel> easier than pressing ctrl+f5 or ctril+shift+r?
[15:37:13] <tw2113> and tends to only be used to resize down to a decent browse size
[15:37:27] <duch_kazatel> coby WAMP only good if you need to support that stack.
[15:37:29] <tw2113> Ansikt, i managed to make the titanic out of facebook
[15:38:05] <coby> Ansikt: which webdev toolbar has that stuff?
[15:38:11] <Ansikt> Yeah, if you look at any of those like/share plugins in the 3d view it's hilarious.
[15:38:28] <Ansikt> coby: the 3d view?  Firefox built in.
[15:38:35] <coby> duch_kazatel: well, I am planning on getting into building custom wordpress stuff
[15:38:52] <coby> Ansikt: oh ok. :D I guess I just missed the ruler
[15:39:07] <duch_kazatel> coby you said you're going to be working for a company, yeah?
[15:39:21] <Ansikt> Ruler is Chris pederick.
[15:39:37] <Ansikt> OH YEAH
[15:39:48] <Ansikt> also, user agent switcher.  Also by Chris Pederick.
[15:40:07] <duch_kazatel> >.> why?
[15:40:08] <duch_kazatel> :(
[15:40:25] <Ansikt> Huh?
[15:40:53] <duch_kazatel> why would you use a user agent switcher at this point?
[15:43:39] <Ansikt> Well, I use Linux.  A lot of sites do a no-Linux approach.  It's also good for stuff like IE-only intranet sites and m-dot sites.
[15:44:04] <duch_kazatel> i'd just fire up VMs at that point, but whatever floats your boat.
[15:47:25] <Technodrome> Good day
[15:47:49] <systemfault> Good day sir.
[15:48:08] <Technodrome> say I created a slideshow, you know one of the front page sort of things, and I want to make that front slider, responsive, what are the steps to do this ?
[15:48:13] <Technodrome> proof of concept here
[15:49:14] <Ansikt> Technodrome, large images are difficult for mobile.  Luckily, if you want a slider/hero type thing, there are a bajillion plugins for that sort of thing.
[15:49:45] <Technodrome> yes yes i know
[15:49:51] <Technodrome> i just want to know how its implemented
[15:49:58] <Ansikt> I've used Malsup's Cycle and Cycle2 to some success.
[15:49:59] <Technodrome> do they use the large image and just “scale it down” ?
[15:50:10] <Technodrome> or when it gets a certain size pull another image?
[15:50:17] <Ansikt> Technodrome, Usually the latter.
[15:50:28] <Ansikt> You don't want to download a massive image only to clip or shrink it.
[15:50:35] <Technodrome> so pull another image?
[15:50:36] <Technodrome> yes
[15:51:11] <Ansikt> Also, mobile devices usually have higher pixel densities.  Stuff like the iPad retina means you have to have a pretty flexible CMS in regards to images.
[15:51:23] <Technodrome> most
[15:51:39] <Technodrome> CMS systems don’t really provide good functionality for responsive sliders out of the box
[15:53:09] <Ansikt> Well, just for image serving specifically.  You should be able to say, "give me that image at 400x400...okay, now at 50x50 with such and such DPI"
[15:53:24] <coby> duch_kazatel: yes sire, but maybe working independent
[15:53:39] <coby> duch_kazatel: gotta go, but it's been good. pm me later :D
[15:53:57] <Ansikt> Honestly though - I've never really had that __actually__ work for me.  Most of the time, I end up just cutting images personally.
[16:04:10] <Madkitty> exit
[16:05:10] <duch_kazatel> enter
[16:06:39] <tw2113> go in
[16:11:37] <Ansikt> get out
[16:12:10] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I have a custom <select> box where on the desktop, I have a custom dropdown box but I want to use the system default select box for touch screen devices. They'll open up fine but it won't actually change their value. Anybody know why this is? This is the code I'm using - https://www.refheap.com/88476
[16:13:57] <frank_o> DeltaHeavy: can't you just use user-agent strings for some `if(isMobile)` thing?
[16:14:36] <frank_o> i use selectize.js for desktop and native selects for mobile so i understand your suffering
[16:15:07] <DeltaHeavy> frank_o: That's not the issue, I can already tell what kind of device they're using, and open the select box for the device used, but when I actually tap on an option it doesn't do anything.
[16:15:15] <duch_kazatel> don't use .attr() for data elements
[16:15:22] <duch_kazatel> you want .data('drop')
[16:15:33] <DeltaHeavy> Oh damn nice. Didn't know that. Thanks duch_kazatel
[16:15:46] <duch_kazatel> $('#' + $(this).attr('data-drop'));
[16:15:58] <duch_kazatel> rather $('#' + $(this).data('drop'));
[16:16:25] <frank_o> DeltaHeavy: you're not using native selects for mobile?
[16:16:38] <Ansikt> $('#' + $(this).data('drop')).trigger("mousedown");  But that's not his problem
[16:16:41] <DeltaHeavy> frank_o: I am, just not for desktop.
[16:17:37] <Ansikt> So, DeltaHeavy, if I understand your problem, you're opening a native select on mobile, but then displaying the data in a custom select?
[16:17:38] <frank_o> :confused:
[16:17:42] <DeltaHeavy> My gosh I wish there was a better way to do this x.x This is one area HTML/CSS really seems to fall short.
[16:18:01] <DeltaHeavy> Ansikt: I want a native select on mobile, but I have a custom select box on desktop
[16:18:30] <DeltaHeavy> https://www.refheap.com/88477
[16:19:00] <duch_kazatel> why not use media queries to hide/show the one you want?
[16:19:02] <Ansikt> DeltaHeavy, But it's displayed in the custom select, just opened on the mobile one, righ?
[16:19:19] <Ansikt> duch_kazatel, I think because what he's concerned about is touch, not screensize.
[16:19:24] <DeltaHeavy> Ansikt: Yes
[16:19:44] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: I still don't want the ugly <select> box for mobile though.
[16:19:53] <duch_kazatel> that's going to be a problem afaik.
[16:20:08] <DeltaHeavy> Man, this crap needs to get fixed @_@
[16:20:13] <duch_kazatel> that business of translating clicks from one place to another is never a good idea.
[16:20:30] <DeltaHeavy> Rediculous the only way to get a half sane <select> box is to use some ugly garbage.
[16:20:38] <frank_o> :confused:
[16:20:43] <Ansikt> What technique are you using for the custom box?
[16:20:46] <Ansikt> Is it a jquery plugin?
[16:20:46] <Ansikt> duch_kazatel++
[16:20:59] <DeltaHeavy> Ansikt: Custom code I've used in many projects.
[16:21:15] <duch_kazatel> i don't think it's ridiculous at all - it might be time to reconsider your approach.
[16:21:21] <duch_kazatel> scrapping an idea is never fun.
[16:21:37] <duch_kazatel> i'll agree that not being able to really style controls is nonsense though.
[16:21:43] <DeltaHeavy> Is there any way to make <select> NOT like like 90's .NET trash?
[16:21:49] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:22:16] <DeltaHeavy> I have a very specific design from a very incompetant designer I need to abide by. I need to get this <select> box looking a very specific way.
[16:22:26] <duch_kazatel> that display has nothing to do with .NET
[16:22:29] <Ansikt> Okay but...how does it detect a change to the value?  Is it a .change() event?
[16:22:29] <Ansikt> Can you post a copy of your plugin?
[16:22:30] <Ansikt> DeltaHeavy, style it with css?
[16:22:30] <Ansikt> Can't do anything about <option> but select you can control.
[16:22:35] <duch_kazatel> if they have a particular design, you're going to have a bunch of pain.
[16:22:58] <Ansikt> Anyways, can we see your plugin code for the <select>
[16:23:00] <DeltaHeavy> Ansikt: I don't have it modularized.
[16:23:15] <Ansikt> Or whatever you call the plugin method.
[16:23:17] <DeltaHeavy> Perhaps I should just style <select> then.
[16:23:22] <Ansikt> *select method
[16:23:39] <DeltaHeavy> Ansikt: It's just a bunch of events, and my current copy is in shambles right now and the CSS is scattered into a bunch of Sass files.
[16:24:05] <DeltaHeavy> Ansikt: This is the JS in its current state - https://www.refheap.com/88478
[16:24:40] <Ansikt> Usually, I just tell my bosses, "that's only possible if [insert five minutes of overly technical rambling], and it will cost 2 weeks of development" when they ask me to do something dumb
[16:25:23] <Ansikt> yo
[16:25:37] <DeltaHeavy> Ansikt: I've been looking for a job for the past month cause I can't handle this coked out idiot and this idiot stoner designer. I need to try to make this work.
[16:25:51] <DeltaHeavy> If you can't tell I hate working for these people lol.
[16:26:31] <DeltaHeavy> This technically can be done it's just not worth the time.
[16:26:56] <duch_kazatel> my bosses just listen to me and trust my judgement usually.
[16:27:09] <duch_kazatel> or smack me back into place.
[16:27:26] <tw2113> ooh option 2
[16:27:27] <tw2113> :P
[16:27:29] <frank_o> i took over my boss' mailinglist and send his customers a bunch of porn
[16:27:38] <DeltaHeavy> This one constantly lies to me telling me they found some idiot on ODesk who can do it at 1/4 of the price.
[16:27:40] <frank_o> since then i've been independent :P
[16:27:46] <DeltaHeavy> I've learned to encourage them to use them. They usually don't bring it up again.
[16:27:48] <Ansikt> frank_o lolwut?
[16:28:20] <DeltaHeavy> This single page website is over 10MB now
[16:28:25] * DeltaHeavy shoots self
[16:28:35] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy holy shit.
[16:28:36] <tw2113> ouch
[16:29:33] <DeltaHeavy> plz kil me
[16:29:50] <DeltaHeavy> Thankfully I have a few very promising job leads on the go right now I'll hopefully hear back from later this week.
[16:30:05] <DeltaHeavy> Will work with people not all mucked up on durgz during working hours.
[16:30:21] <duch_kazatel> you should go for those.
[16:30:31] <DeltaHeavy> Beleive me I am lol
[16:30:39] <DeltaHeavy> I'm working as a freelancer right now. This guy is my old boss.
[16:30:57] <Ansikt> Haha....can we actually see your site?
[16:31:21] <DeltaHeavy> So glad I won't ever have to deal with this crap. A designer who knows almost nothing about what goes under the hood of a website and can't account for things like fixed positioned elements scrolling over different colours
[16:31:26] <DeltaHeavy> Ansikt: Not after I've said all this no :p
[16:32:51] <Ansikt> Also, let me get this straight, the select box opens, you select it, it closes, and then the native select box remains unchanged?
[16:33:10] <DeltaHeavy> Ansikt: Are you asking me what I want, or what's happening?
[16:33:49] <Ansikt> What's happening
[16:34:12] <Ansikt> Is it that the custom code isn't registering the "change" event, or that the select just isn't changing?
[16:34:21] <DeltaHeavy> Right now, on mobile you click '.drop', which opens up the <select> box. When I click on an <option> it doesn't change the value of the <select>
[16:34:36] <DeltaHeavy> It's not registering a change event, I assume because the <select> isn't changing.
[16:35:40] <duch_kazatel> console.log() in that change btw
[16:35:43] <Ansikt> And you're sure the select isn't changing?  And when you say mobile you mean, mobile safari?
[16:36:13] <Ansikt> Also, that isn't your real code, right?  because there's a syntax error
[16:36:18] <DeltaHeavy> Ansikt: Chrome on Android
[16:36:19] <Ansikt> specifically, there's an unclosed block comment
[16:36:34] <DeltaHeavy> Most of that is commented out
[16:36:42] <DeltaHeavy> If you see there's a /* the syntax highlighting is too crappy to pick up
[16:36:49] <DeltaHeavy>  /*$('body').on('touchstart', '.drop', function () {
[16:37:06] <Ansikt> yeah but, where's the */
[16:37:20] <DeltaHeavy> At the next bunch of code
[16:37:21] <Ansikt> Ohhh, that's intentional
[16:37:23] <DeltaHeavy> There's a comment
[16:37:25] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah
[16:37:32] <Ansikt> I thought I found the most hilarious problem.
[16:37:44] <DeltaHeavy> lol
[16:37:58] <Ansikt> Almost as bad as earlier when I forgot to save the file, after spending 20 mins debugging grunt
[16:38:07] <Ansikt> but no...weird.
[16:38:35] <DeltaHeavy> I wish debugging on mobile wasn't half impossible =/
[16:38:42] <DeltaHeavy> lol
[16:38:52] <v0lksman> why can't I "trigger" a button?  https://dpaste.de/1EhY
[16:39:05] <Ansikt> Try changing the CSS classes.
[16:39:27] <duch_kazatel> v0lksman $('button[rel=13]')[0] gets you the underlying DOM node, not the jquery object.
[16:39:31] <duch_kazatel> you want .eq(0)
[16:39:39] <duch_kazatel> instead of the [0]
[16:39:59] <zzaichik> bam
[16:40:18] <v0lksman> duch_kazatel: thanks but now I get TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object
[16:40:48] <Ansikt> I always namespace my classes js-[whatever] (so, js-drop or something), then have a seperate css class for styles.  Try making that select visible and see if that fixes the problem
[16:41:01] <Ansikt> I know you can't force click handlers on hidden elements in IE, for example.
[16:41:03] <duch_kazatel> then your selector is bad.  try $('button[rel="13"]')
[16:41:30] <Ansikt> duch_kazatel, $(selector)[0] is the same as $(selector).get(0)
[16:42:16] <duch_kazatel> that's not what he wants./
[16:42:18] <v0lksman> $('button[rel="13"]').trigger();
[16:42:22] <v0lksman> oops...sry
[16:42:24] <Ansikt> also, v0lksman the problem is you need to trigger an event, man
[16:42:27] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[16:42:44] <v0lksman> Ansikt: namespace = great idea...will try to implement from now on
[16:42:46] <duch_kazatel> Ansikt that error means that trigger() ins't inheriting
[16:42:53] <Ansikt> also, v0lksman the problem is you need to trigger an event, man
[16:42:56] <duch_kazatel> attribute selectors are a bad idea anyway.
[16:43:01] <duch_kazatel> Ansikt that will not cause his error.
[16:43:03] <Ansikt> I think...is there a no-arg version of trigger?
[16:43:50] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:43:54] <zzaichik> trigger('click');
[16:44:05] <Ansikt> Exactly
[16:44:09] <v0lksman> yep...that helped!
[16:44:15] <v0lksman> although still not 100%
[16:44:21] <duch_kazatel> are you still getting that error?
[16:44:50] <Ansikt> duch_kazatel, Doesn't get(0) also return the DOM node?
[16:45:09] <v0lksman> duch_kazatel: nope...I get no error now
[16:45:16] <duch_kazatel> *sigh* yes it does, but his specific issue is he's trying to run jquery methdos against a non jquery object.
[16:45:26] <duch_kazatel> .get(0) is the same as [0], but he needs .eq(0) instead.
[16:45:29] <DeltaHeavy> Is there anyway to select something using $() without it being wrapped as a jQ object?
[16:45:40] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy what do you mean?
[16:45:46] <Ansikt> Oh, gotcha.  Looking back, I realized I was blindly reading.
[16:45:49] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: I just want the raw element
[16:46:05] <Ansikt> DeltaHeavy, Dude, that's what we were just talking about.
[16:46:09] <duch_kazatel> use can use document.querySelector() or document.querySelectorAll()
[16:46:26] <duch_kazatel> instead of using the jquery constructor
[16:46:46] <Ansikt> Also, "this" and event.target return the naked object as well.  so you can $(selector).each()
[16:46:57] <DeltaHeavy> I was using 'this.children' but I couldn't figure out how to get the specific one
[16:47:06] <DeltaHeavy> I need to use querySelector in conjunction with 'this' though =/
[16:47:31] <DeltaHeavy> I could do this but it's a crappy solution - x.children[2]
[16:47:39] <Ansikt> DeltaHeavy, you can qualify the children selecotr
[16:47:42] <Ansikt> *method
[16:47:43] <Ansikt> so
[16:48:08] <Ansikt> $(selected).children(".only-the-good-ones")
[16:48:24] <DeltaHeavy> Ansikt: But I don't want it returning a jQ object. Seems to be mucking up my event.
[16:48:41] <systemfault> DeltaHeavy: Just unwrap it after, no?
[16:48:47] <systemfault> (Before returning it)
[16:48:48] <duch_kazatel> btw jquery events and native browser events are distinct.
[16:48:53] <DeltaHeavy> systemfault: How do I do that?
[16:49:01] <systemfault> DeltaHeavy: .get(0) or foo[0]
[16:49:46] <DeltaHeavy> systemfault: Ah, thoguht there'd be more to it rather than it just being an array.
[16:49:49] <duch_kazatel> that gets you the first one of that selector though.
[16:49:59] <spookah> is it possible to embed a vertical tab panel inside an accordian which is inside a horizontal tab panel?
[16:50:01] <duch_kazatel> the jquery object is array-like, so you can do stuff like that with it.
[16:50:49] <systemfault> DeltaHeavy: If you need all the nodes, it’s .get() without passing it an index
[16:50:53] <Ansikt> DeltaHeavy, Also, DeltaHeavy, I think you're doing more work than you need to
[16:51:04] <DeltaHeavy> systemfault: Thanks, just putting [0] at the end of it worked.
[16:51:07] <DeltaHeavy> Ansikt: What should I do?
[16:51:51] <Ansikt> DeltaHeavy, let me try to write a basic, dumb example.
[16:52:27] <DeltaHeavy> Ansikt: Thanks
[16:52:54] <Ansikt> I realize that sounds like...I'm talking down to you.  I'm just saying that it won't be production ready or whatever
[16:53:55] <DeltaHeavy> What won't? What I"m doing right now?
[16:54:13] <DeltaHeavy> Ansikt: I won't take offense though.
[16:54:33] <DeltaHeavy> I understand what I'm doing is a hack. I'm just doing it cause I feel limited by what <select> provides.
[16:54:48] <DeltaHeavy> Paul Irish was on a huge bender a while back about how it sucks.
[16:55:02] <duch_kazatel> paul irish is always on a bender about something.
[16:55:08] <duch_kazatel> luckily we all benefit in the end usually.
[16:55:21] <DeltaHeavy> Hail Paul Irish and all of his glory.
[16:55:45] <Ansikt> Naw, just that my example will suck.
[16:55:49] <DeltaHeavy> Not even this is working - https://www.refheap.com/88480
[16:56:44] <duch_kazatel> do $(document) instead of $('body')
[16:57:05] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: WHy just out of curiosity?
[16:57:32] <duch_kazatel> iird you actually want $(document).on('touchstart', function() {});
[16:57:32] <duch_kazatel> try that
[16:57:35] <duch_kazatel> *iirc
[16:57:55] <DeltaHeavy> What about the other parmeter for on() for delegation?
[16:58:14] <duch_kazatel> just reading search results.
[16:58:21] <duch_kazatel> did you try at least changing that to document?
[16:58:33] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: Yep, same result I've just found out now.
[16:58:38] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9390643/jquery-touchstart-event-not-working-in-iphone
[16:59:38] <DeltaHeavy> Is that the same functionality of .on() that I'm looking for? I don't think so
[16:59:43] <DeltaHeavy> I tried it though and it doesn't see m to be working
[16:59:49] <DeltaHeavy> I might just write a native JS event perhaps
[16:59:51] <duch_kazatel> then you have another problem./
[16:59:58] <duch_kazatel> did you validate your document?
[17:00:08] <v0lksman> Ansikt: duch_kazatel thanks guys...all fixed up...appreciate the extra set of eyes
[17:00:14] <duch_kazatel> v0lksman fsho
[17:01:07] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: Yeah, it's not perfect but no issues in this area.
[17:02:00] <DeltaHeavy> Imma take a smoke break, chill out. Won't be too productive while this fustrated. I'll be back in 5min
[17:04:09] <xp_prg> I am trying to find out the lowest version of jquery I can use with the jquery ui slider, can anyone tell me please?
[17:04:46] <duch_kazatel> which version of jquery ui are you using?
[17:06:02] <piercedwater> .9
[17:06:49] <xp_prg> duck_kazatel, let me check one esec
[17:07:36] <xp_prg>  1.8.17_jquery-ui.min.js
[17:17:57] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel, Ansikt: Yeah, dispatching the click event via JS is the culprate here.
[17:18:09] <duch_kazatel> called it :)
[17:18:25] <Ansikt> So, .click() fixed it?
[17:19:18] <DeltaHeavy> Ansikt: Nope, nothing is fixed :p
[17:20:12] <Ansikt> Hah
[17:20:58] <DeltaHeavy> So I'm wondering now if what I need to do is impossible.
[17:21:14] <frickettz> If I bind a click event inside of a function, and then I call that function multiple times throughout my code, will it bind multiple click events each time I call that function?  Or does it only do it once in the function?
[17:22:00] <Ansikt> Every time it runs, those will be bound.
[17:22:13] <Ansikt> So if it runs 4 times, then you click, the handler will go 4 times
[17:22:29] <Ansikt> Also, I need to reboot my computer, but what you're trying isn't impossible.
[17:22:45] <Ansikt> just not a good idea, probably
[17:22:53] <frickettz> damn
[17:22:55] <duch_kazatel> frickettz it will re-bind every time.
[17:23:01] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do?
[17:23:08] <frickettz> Thanks guys, was afraid of that.
[17:23:10] <frickettz> Well
[17:23:40] <frickettz> Honestly I don't think I could explain it well enough at the moment
[17:24:03] <duch_kazatel> if you only want to bind the handler once each time, you can use .one() instead of .on(), but that's usually gross and/or a hack.
[17:24:37] <frickettz> Interesting, I did not know about .one()
[17:24:38] <duch_kazatel> well, it'll bind it however many times and then run each bound one once.
[17:25:32] <frickettz> I'm not even using .on right now, just .click... but that's still a bind is that right?
[17:25:46] <duch_kazatel> .click() uses .on() under the hood
[17:25:53] <frickettz> Ah ok
[17:26:45] <imjakechapman> hey everyone. Question, I have some code that tracks window scroll.... but it doesn't trigger when I scroll anything faster then barely moving the scroll... Anyone know what could possibly be wrong?
[17:27:02] <duch_kazatel> share the code and we can look.

[19:04:20] <alphis> anyone know why this snippet of code is failing? http://pastebin.com/2Ezbgar0
[19:05:24] <Forbidd3n> anyone?
[19:05:45] <Forbidd3n> alphis: what is it doing or not doing? What do you mean failing
[19:08:23] <alphis> Forbidd3n: its not adding the value of checked checkboxes to my array
[19:08:31] <alphis> the array "pids"
[19:08:46] <alphis> its defined before that snippet as pids=new Array();

[19:11:11] <alphis> i REMOVED it
[19:11:18] <alphis> making it even easier to alert all checkboxes
[19:11:19] <alphis> didn't wrok
[19:11:33] <alphis> i can add the console now
[19:12:33] <Forbidd3n> what did you get on the console.log?
[19:12:40] <Forbidd3n> did it find all checkboxes below the radio
[19:12:58] <Forbidd3n> can you give a simple fiddle of your layout
[19:13:02] <Forbidd3n> concept
[19:13:22] <alphis> hmm
[19:13:29] <alphis> the console output
[19:13:45] <alphis> has context: input attribute 1 (which i assume is the radiobox itself)
[19:13:55] <alphis> and a crapton of other seemingly unrelated info
[19:14:06] <alphis> prevObject selector constructor etc
[19:16:18] <Forbidd3n> can you fiddle an example of your html with jquery?
[19:17:03] <alphis> Forbidd3n: http://pastebin.com/jge4VZk5
[19:17:24] <Forbidd3n> can you do a jsfiddle.net?
[19:17:29] <alphis> seems so simple, yet can't do something as simple as collect checked checkboxes that are CHILDREN OF A CHECKED RADIOBOX
[19:17:29] <Forbidd3n> so we can get it to work
[19:17:35] <alphis> jsfiddle? wassat
[19:18:41] <alphis> im there..i pasted html/js but dont see how this will help
[19:19:19] <Forbidd3n> paste js, html and include jquery on left and save
[19:19:22] <Forbidd3n> and send me url
[19:22:04] <Forbidd3n> alphis: ?
[19:22:23] <alphis> Forbidd3n: http://jsfiddle.net/Lt2wA/
[19:22:32] <alphis> trying to get this crap to work
[19:22:38] <alphis> never used jsfiddler before
[19:23:52] <Forbidd3n> second will work on it for you
[19:24:59] <alphis> thx
[19:29:56] <Unopoo> hi, how do I toggle checkbox's check status on click?
[19:34:30] <Forbidd3n> alphis: you do not have the checkboxes wrapped in a parent
[19:34:45] <Forbidd3n> if I wrap them in a parent then you can select all checkboxes in the radio parent
[19:35:03] <alphis> what do you mean wrapped in a parent?
[19:35:12] <alphis> they are children of a P which is a child of the radiobox
[19:35:39] <Forbidd3n> you don't have a beginning p in the fiddle
[19:35:47] <Forbidd3n> one sec p goes inside of moreinfo correct?
[19:36:20] <alphis> yeah
[19:36:22] <alphis> also...crap...
[19:36:27] * alphis looks at html
[19:36:58] <Forbidd3n> also it wouldn't be children of radio since it isn't a descendant
[19:37:01] <Forbidd3n> it is a sibling
[19:37:05] <Forbidd3n> one sec
[19:37:09] <alphis> crap i think i see what u mean
[19:37:15] <alphis> there is only 1 wrapper
[19:37:22] <alphis> and the radio AND checkboxes are BOTH inside it
[19:37:23] <alphis> ffs
[19:37:54] <alphis> i suppose i could do the find() on the radio's parent (the div containing them all)
[19:40:21] <alphis> yup
[19:40:22] <alphis> that worked!
[19:40:37] <alphis> thanks so much. it was so obvious. wouldn't have seen it if you hadn't mentioned it =]

[19:46:19] <frickettz> Hey duch_kazatel, you around for a quick Q?  Wondering what you think about something.
[19:48:50] <frickettz> Or if anyone else has thoughts.  I'm binding an event handler inside of a function, but I'm calling that function several times throughout my code so it binds several events.  I only want it to bind once.  Wondering what peopel think of this top solution:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8408826/bind-event-only-once
[19:51:09] <alphis> Forbidd3n: thanks again =]

[21:28:03] <taoman> hi all
[21:28:17] <taoman> i am trying to figure out ajax success scope
[21:28:32] <taoman> on this function: http://pastebin.com/j6ZPktvr
[21:28:44] <taoman> i am getting true on the first alert, and false on the second alert
[21:29:10] <taoman> any help appreciated
[21:32:24] <greshnikk> Hello. I have several divs without any id, but having same class 'myClass'. I am trying to fadeOut first div, so I do $('.myClass').get(0).fadeOut(); getting an error fadeOut is not a function. What am I doing wrong ?
[21:35:21] <tw2113> is the get() actually finding anything?
[21:36:54] <greshnikk> It finds [object HTMLDivElement] - here is fast jsfiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/X66f8/
[21:37:39] <greshnikk> If I remove .get(0) it works, but it fades out all my divs. I need to select which div I want to fadeOut.
[21:44:29] <greshnikk> Well I found a solution... but I used iterator to go through all elements. It's bad solution I think, however it works. http://jsfiddle.net/X66f8/1/

[22:20:00] <jumanji> hi guys how do I block until some action (function) has been completed in the future? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24902368/jquery-wait-for-callback-and-block-until-it-is-received?noredirect=1#comment38686638_24902368
[22:20:35] <jumanji> I am using $.when(waitForuserInput()).done(function()); but its still not blocking, it will continue on
[22:26:03] <systemfault> jumanji: You can’t block an async function. You can only add what happens after inside its callback
[22:26:43] <jumanji> that sucks
[22:27:17] <systemfault> Heh.
[22:27:38] <jumanji> so how would i approach this problem?
[22:27:50] <jumanji> basically i have a while loop with a switch case in it
[22:28:06] <jumanji> one of the cases require user input, waits for a user click
[22:28:21] <jumanji> as soon as thats done the rest of the code should continue
[22:28:24] <jumanji> and the loop keeps going
[22:28:41] <systemfault> jumanji: The rule is simple with async…. if you have a function that uses an async function inside it… then your function is now an async function
[22:29:18] <systemfault> jumanji: basically, your function needs to either have a callback parameter… or return a promise
[22:29:42] <jumanji> $(document).on('click', '*', function (e) {         return "user clicked";     });
[22:29:49] <jumanji> thats what it does
[22:30:00] <systemfault> You can’t return when dealing with async
[22:30:20] <jumanji> ah
[22:33:19] <afroradiohead> Hello everyone
[22:40:52] <jumanji> systemfault: okay i updated the code, any suggestions on how to accomplish this? http://pastie.org/9413980#7
[22:41:39] <systemfault> Let me see
[22:43:21] <jumanji> im basically trying to create a wizard, so in each step it waits for user to click on an element on the current page, and then continues on
[22:44:20] <systemfault> Then you create different “html” slides and attach events to them. The structure of this code isn’t right with how the browser works.
[22:44:38] <systemfault> The browser is all about dealing with events.
[22:45:16] <systemfault> Also, the way your logic is setup, everytime getInputAndSave is going to get called, it’s going to add a new handler.
[22:45:44] <systemfault> So first question, the callback is going to be called once… second question, twice…etc etc
[22:45:52] <jumanji> hmmm
[22:46:03] <jumanji> im basically just prototyping so i am using confirm instead of dialogues
[22:46:40] <systemfault> jumanji: confirm is blocking… on a real app, you’d use overlays and they’re not blocking so that logic is flawed.
[22:47:13] <taoman> systemfault, i have a similar problem, i need to check a value in a database, i do this with a function that calls itself after a setTimeout
[22:47:40] <taoman> on user input, the value in the db changes, and this recursive function calls a method
[22:48:08] <taoman> my problem is that me method called is longer than the setTimeout, so it gets called many times before it finish
[22:48:23] <taoman> i can't figure how to call this new method in the right context :c
[22:48:57] <systemfault> taoman: Show me what you have or I could write a small example of an async loop using setTimeout, whichever you prefer
[22:49:29] <jumanji> systemfault: hmm i see
[22:49:33] <jumanji> systemfault: i think this is what i'll do
[22:49:33] <taoman> systemfault, http://pastebin.com/e5sF5NRe
[22:50:07] <jumanji> systemfault: when it asks confirm(), it will just exit the loop, remember the status, ask for user input, resume
[22:50:23] <jumanji> i guess theres no other way
[22:50:29] <taoman> systemfault, iniciar() shows a text for longer than 500 ms
[22:50:48] <systemfault> taoman: You want the setTimeout inside the success callback, no?
[22:51:25] <systemfault> taoman: Or else, it’s just going to run in loop every 500ms without caring if getConfig is done
[22:52:01] <taoman> yes, let me try that too
[22:52:11] <taoman> but my problem is with calling iniciar()
[22:52:27] <taoman> let me fix that
[22:52:39] <taoman> done
[22:52:52] <systemfault> taoman: GIve me an updated pastebin
[22:54:04] <taoman> systemfault, http://pastebin.com/ZeKYdYJR
[22:54:33] <systemfault> taoman: So what’s wrong now? (Except for the typo on the if)
[22:54:33] <taoman> i misstyped some j before an if
[22:54:37] <taoman> yeah
[22:54:46] <taoman> the timeout is called too soon
[22:54:54] <sflw> Hi everyone, I'm trying to figure out how to send an email with jQuery containing data from a form on my website. All I've found so far are tutorials involving PHP scripts and I don't know PHP: http://trevordavis.net/blog/ajax-forms-with-jquery/. Anyone have other recommendations?
[22:55:20] <taoman> systemfault, the method iniciar() shows a random text and takes a while (also with a timeout)
[22:55:32] <taoman> but since it gets called every 500 ms, it shows one text after the other
[22:55:39] <systemfault> sflw: You need a server side technology to do it properly (Like PHP) or else, you’re stuck with ugly mailto: hrefs
[22:55:54] <systemfault> taoman: And that’s not what you want?
[22:56:13] <sflw> systemfault: I see. I know python but I don't have the time to write something for the back end right now. Can I just directly use the php from this tutorial safely?
[22:56:22] <systemfault> taoman: Perhaps I just don’t understand what you want.
[22:56:42] <taoman> systemfault, it should wait until iniciar() is done to resume the timeout
[22:57:41] <systemfault> sflw: You can’t use it “as-is”, no
[22:57:58] <systemfault> sflw: Unless you want your users to send emails to anyone.
[22:58:18] <systemfault> taoman: Then why don’t you give me the code of that function?
[22:58:29] <sflw> systemfault: I would edit the $mailTo to be a specific email address for receiving the form and the $mailFrom would be the email supplied by the user filling out the form. Does that work?
[22:58:32] <systemfault> taoman: You omitted the most important part of the code
[22:58:42] <taoman> systemfault, ok, thanks for your time c: i'll paste it, hold on
[22:58:43] <systemfault> sflw: Yes
[22:58:51] <sflw> systemfault: Awesome. I'll give it a shot. Thanks for your help.
[22:59:09] <systemfault> sflw: You’ll need a smtp server installed though...
[22:59:17] <systemfault> sflw: mail() isn’t magic
[22:59:30] <taoman> systemfault, http://pastebin.com/ZeKYdYJR
[22:59:38] <sflw> systemfault: Oops.  Better Google that. I'm using GoDaddy so hopefully they provide some support for that.
[22:59:44] * sflw points to his newbie sticker.
[22:59:53] <systemfault> taoman: Ahhhh
[23:00:34] <taoman> systemfault, theres a reference to switchOff, thats a method, it only changes the database value back to its initial state
[23:00:49] <systemfault> taoman: is switchoff also async?
[23:01:06] <taoman> yes :c
[23:01:14] <systemfault> oh shit...
[23:01:18] <taoman> this is kind of my first attempt at ajax
[23:01:27] <taoman> i know
[23:01:44] <taoman> async spagetti
[23:01:53] <systemfault> taoman: Yeah… the rule with async is that if you have a function that uses an async function, that function becomes async.
[23:02:20] <systemfault> taoman: So, switchoff should have a callback parameter that is called when it’s done… and inicar too
[23:02:59] <taoman> systemfault, in the same way as getConfig() at the beginning?
[23:03:36] <systemfault> taoman: getConfig is also async, it’s just that it uses “promises” to deal with async instead of normal callbacks
[23:05:46] <systemfault> taoman: Is the code for switchoff complex? If not, you could just add it to the pastebin, I’ll try to help.
[23:06:13] <taoman> would you please point to some example of using callbacks? i read this stackOverflow post and didnt understood to be honest http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14220321/how-to-return-the-response-from-an-ajax-call
[23:06:24] <taoman> not at all, i'll paste it
[23:06:57] <taoman> there http://pastebin.com/ZeKYdYJR
[23:07:48] <taoman> im am doing a website that looks like a unix-like terminal
[23:08:06] <taoman> so, when someone types in a word, it should show a random video
[23:08:33] <systemfault> taoman: I’m going to clean the code and give you an updated pastebin.. the result might not work because I can’t test… but it should give you an idea.
[23:08:47] <taoman> systemfault, ok, thank you very much
