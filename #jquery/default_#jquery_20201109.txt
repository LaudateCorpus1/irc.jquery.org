[16:45:34] <gizmore> good evening. when i submit a jquery-mobile form via enter, no submit button is sent in POST vars... bothering me since 2 hours :(
[16:45:57] <robertmaxrees> gizmore hrm??
[16:46:31] <gizmore> on normal behaviour you would expect the first enabled submit button to be sent to the server
[16:46:55] <gizmore> no idea what it could be... seems to be a jquery mobile problem
[16:47:19] <gizmore> 1.5.0 / latest on npm
[16:47:31] <robertmaxrees> that's news to me.
[16:47:46] <robertmaxrees> never seen a button get sent over a post.
[16:50:36] <gizmore> the button name and it's value are sent on vanilla html on any browser
[16:50:47] <gizmore> on jqm, only when i click the button
[16:50:51] <robertmaxrees> huh.  news to me.
[16:50:54] <gizmore> if i press enter in an input, not
[16:51:06] <gizmore> and on vanilla html even on enter a button is sent
[16:51:16] <gizmore> bootstrap works as well
[16:51:21] <gizmore> and angular material
[16:51:42] <gizmore> plain html works too :)
[16:53:19] <robertmaxrees> never seen a native browser send button data over.  don't even think the builtin FormData constructor represents the button.
[16:54:02] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5t3qL8ng/
[16:55:11] <gizmore> thx to the word "formData" i think i found the bug
[16:55:20] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:26:48] <gizmore> thx robertmaxrees ... the problem was icons using <button data-icon="some-icon"> in the forms.... switched to <span> and now it works
[17:27:01] <robertmaxrees> confused but alright :)
[17:27:06] <robertmaxrees> glad you were able to fix!
[18:29:35] <gizmore> robertmaxrees: jquerymobile tries to find the first button on a form submit (almost like plain html does too) (plain only respects type="submit" i guess)... so he always found an icon :)
[18:29:46] <gizmore> and icon (button) does not have name :P
[18:29:56] <robertmaxrees> still confused without seeing code but okie :)
[18:30:02] <gizmore> hope i can install soon
[18:30:27] <robertmaxrees> install what?
[18:32:08] <gizmore> new demo website for my new framework
[18:32:27] <gizmore> here is one http://mettwitze.gizmore.org  (hope it's not spam) - this is bootstrap design
[18:32:34] <gizmore> working on a new material theme
[18:32:42] <gizmore> working on a new jquerymobile theme *
[18:33:00] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.  fwiw jqm isn't really an active project any more so ymmv with adoption :)
[18:33:11] <gizmore> yeah... and it has a few problems
[18:33:24] <robertmaxrees> right, because it's not really an active project any more ;)
[18:33:44] <gizmore> like loading pages does not work on status codes >= 400
[18:33:51] <gizmore> so i disabled all ajax! ... last resort
[18:34:15] <robertmaxrees> what pages are you serving that you want to display that are 4xx or higher??
[18:34:19] <gizmore> and 1.5.0 is really not ready.... you find almost nothing on the web... the docs are not really accurate (yet)
[18:34:25] <robertmaxrees> slash endpoints
[18:34:35] <gizmore> if you send an invalid form on my framework you get a 405
[18:34:49] <gizmore> actually responses have a status code and on rendering i set it
[18:35:15] <gizmore> so you get a normal page, but 405 for error
[18:35:18] <robertmaxrees> confused then - if jquery mobile isn't compatibile, isn't actively being developed, and conflicts with your framework, why are you pushing to support it?
[18:35:33] <gizmore> i like it
[18:35:38] <robertmaxrees> lol alright.
[18:35:48] <gizmore> it is easily responsive
[18:36:05] <gizmore> with good intentions here and there.... the autocomplete stuff looks nice and is not complicated
[18:36:27] <robertmaxrees> i'd focus on other frameworks/libraries but okie :)
[18:36:34] <gizmore> what do you use?
[18:37:24] <robertmaxrees> jquery mobile is all but dead at this point.  same with jqui.  there was a project to fundamentally rebuild them and re-architect them but it lost steam.
[18:37:51] <robertmaxrees> not many people are choosing jqm for new projects, and anybody looking to, say, to major rebuilds of their frontend are often just migrating away from it.
[18:43:55] <gizmore> it still is solid in my eyes
[18:44:08] <gizmore> angular material is so focused on typescript since v3
[18:44:15] <gizmore> and it's tricky to build apps with it
[18:44:35] <robertmaxrees> eh, lack of support and the bugs should be cause to not futz with it.
[18:44:45] <gizmore> jqm?
[18:44:50] <robertmaxrees> jquery mobile
[18:44:55] <gizmore> i can fork it and fix it
[18:45:00] <robertmaxrees> angular, react, vue, etc are all where you'd want to invest your time these days.
[18:45:17] <gizmore> angular i like... but new versions are typescript as well?
[18:45:35] <robertmaxrees> they use angular internally, yes.
[18:46:30] <robertmaxrees> err, sorry, typescript.
[18:47:24] <gizmore> ah ... yeah... i dont want to learn it
[18:47:32] <robertmaxrees> don't have to.
[18:47:44] <robertmaxrees> can just use normal js.  js is valid ts
[18:47:48] <gizmore> but all docs aare typescript :P
[18:47:58] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: then use another framework.
[18:47:58] <gizmore> all seem to know ts now... but me
[18:48:10] <robertmaxrees> typescript really isn't that difficult.
[18:48:26] <gizmore> jquery is good to go. there are many plugins that support it and almost none is ts
[18:48:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:48:53] <robertmaxrees> because most of them were written well before ts existed.
[18:49:06] <gizmore> jqm is maybe not the best idea... but i will try.... day 4 of implementing a gdo6 theme with jqm
[18:50:20] <robertmaxrees> also keep in mind that any bugs in new browser releases likely won't be fixed.  things like https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8640
[18:51:19] <gizmore> yeah... thank you for the advise :)
[18:51:24] <gizmore> here is my framework btw: https://github.com/gizmore/gdo6
[18:52:42] <robertmaxrees> i legit forget about php all the time haha
[18:52:47] <robertmaxrees> but cool.
[18:53:33] <gizmore> i like php :p
[18:53:45] <gizmore> if it only had posix thread support -.-
[18:53:52] <gizmore> i want to write a nice chatbot
[18:55:07] <gizmore> recently i created a session handler via cookies. they are AES encrypted so you cannot temper... then i changed that user_last_activity is only updated once in a minute.... got me down to no database needed for many pages
[18:55:52] <robertmaxrees> wait did you write a system to encrypt the cookies yourself?  you know there are baked-in ways to handle that, yeah?
[18:58:08] <gizmore> didn't look... many systems do it
[18:58:23] <gizmore> there probably is nice code out there... but meh
[18:58:26] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you create an httponly cookie and store data that way.
[18:58:43] <robertmaxrees> no tampering.  can also encrypt it.  can't be seen by in-page js.
[18:59:10] <gizmore> yeah... here is my impl: https://github.com/gizmore/gdo6-session-cookie
[18:59:56] <robertmaxrees> also: don't store that much data in cookies.  you run into issues eventually.  check out IndexedDB and Web SQL instead.
[19:01:17] <gizmore> session should not hold that much info... last url is one of the bigger fields
[19:01:47] <robertmaxrees> you should check out PWAs - sounds like that's the sort of stuff you want for your frontend.
[19:02:44] <gizmore> should find a nice way to sync server/client first
[19:02:57] <robertmaxrees> PWAs give you that exact capability :)
[19:03:02] <robertmaxrees> and a whole lot more.
[19:15:57] <gizmore> did you take a look at my mettwitze site?
[19:16:12] <gizmore> could be a pwa as well.... syncing the entries when online
[19:16:21] <gizmore> would make sense to have them offline available
[19:16:42] <gizmore> but how to keep all pages working?... mark methods as offline?
[19:17:01] <gizmore> sync data when a method is offline and executed online?
[19:17:06] <gizmore> tricky
[19:17:10] <gizmore> but interesting idea
[19:17:41] <gizmore> i will first implement nodb stuff... site without any database at all is also a nice idea
[19:17:57] <gizmore> i also implemented my own db stuff :P
[19:18:07] <gizmore> in v6, only mysql/maria is supported
[19:18:12] <gizmore> screw all those others
[19:18:24] <gizmore> in earlier versions i tried to support more
[19:22:33] <gizmore> in earlier versions i wrote a chatbot that has a shadowrun interactive rpg with over 100 quests.... it still lives in #shadowlamb
[19:23:26] <robertmaxrees> PWAs involve using service workers, which are incredibly powerful tools for handling network requests.
[19:23:51] <robertmaxrees> tho now we're WAY offtopic haha - anyway, give 'em a look and do some research on 'em.  solves a lot of problems you're working with.
[19:26:15] <gizmore> my stuff shall also work in text only browsers... it's not that easy
[19:26:27] <robertmaxrees> cool.
