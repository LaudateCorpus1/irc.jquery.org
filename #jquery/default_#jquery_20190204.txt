[03:26:20] <rightnow> Hello! Im trying to run some jquery code on another website through the console. If i mouseclick a link with id: __component0---detail--vehicleOwnerIconTab-text   it works. When I do $('#__component0---detail--vehicleOwnerIconTab-text').trigger('click') the console just answers with "r.fn.init {}" and nothing happne
[03:27:41] <Cork> rightnow: are you sure the id is js activated and not just a normal link?
[03:28:19] <rightnow> its not a normal link, it seems like its a bootstrap tab
[03:28:22] <rightnow> its a div
[03:28:49] <Cork> not sure with the amount of info then; should work
[03:32:15] <rightnow> ok
[03:32:48] <rightnow> Checking the console on the item it says null on every event onmousmove, onmouseup, onmouseleave etc
[03:33:14] <rightnow> what if it was a normal link, how would i juse jquery to click it?
[03:42:09] <Cork> rightnow: you can't
[03:42:25] <Cork> javascript can't trigger default actions on elements
[03:42:36] <Cork> it is a security feature in browsers
[03:43:13] <Cork> (you can navigate to the url by setting window.location = link.href; but that it NOT the same as clicking a link)
[04:06:15] <rightnow> ok
[10:38:57] <undefined_bob> is there a syntax error in this line?
[10:38:59] <undefined_bob>     $('#executeFilter').find(\":hidden[name='fnc']\").val('executeSingleFilter');
[10:40:11] <undefined_bob> console said: SyntaxError: illegal character
[10:40:31] <undefined_bob> but I'm not sure which character is nor correct
[10:45:08] <shoky> undefined_bob:  remove the backslashes \
[12:28:23] <gambl0re> hello?
[12:46:03] <GeekMonkey> Hey all.... I am trying to change the content of textarea using Jquery.... it works fine in my demo.... but when I apply it to my gravity form on the live site it doesn't work
[12:46:24] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey mind showing the code?
[12:46:49] <GeekMonkey> $('#input_18_1').val("test");
[12:46:59] <GeekMonkey> <textarea name="input_1" id="input_18_1" class="textarea medium" tabindex="50" aria-invalid="false" rows="10" cols="50"></textarea>
[12:47:10] <robertmaxrees> $('[id="input_18_1"]').length
[12:47:18] <robertmaxrees> what does this give you?
[12:49:40] <GeekMonkey> checking
[12:50:24] <GeekMonkey> not getting anything
[12:50:34] <robertmaxrees> not even 0?
[12:51:15] <GeekMonkey> there we go... cache issue
[12:51:16] <GeekMonkey> I get 1
[12:52:17] <robertmaxrees> okay.  what if you do a .css('border', '10px solid red') ?
[12:52:26] <robertmaxrees> does it change the element you're expectiong?
[12:52:29] <robertmaxrees> *expecting.
[12:52:45] <robertmaxrees> because there's a very real chance that your plugin is going something weird
[12:52:49] <robertmaxrees> *doing
[12:53:10] <GeekMonkey> I am guessing it is gravity forms blocking me from changing the content of the text area
[12:53:22] <robertmaxrees> doubtful.
[12:54:14] <GeekMonkey> your css works
[12:54:53] <GeekMonkey> I even tried this $('#input_18_1').val('test');
[12:54:53] <robertmaxrees> interesting.  can you make a fiddle then?
[12:55:10] <GeekMonkey> it works in my codepen
[12:55:21] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[12:55:29] <GeekMonkey> but not on the site with gravity forms
[12:56:23] <GeekMonkey> I can get the value of it... just can't change the value of it..... that is why I think gravity forms is blocking it
[12:56:26] <GeekMonkey> some how
[12:56:37] <robertmaxrees> i doubt that.
[12:57:17] <robertmaxrees> try this: inspect the element you're trying to modify.,
[12:57:22] <robertmaxrees> make sure it's what you think it is.
[12:57:36] <GeekMonkey> ok
[12:57:51] <robertmaxrees> also: see if gravity forms has a JS api you can hook into.
[13:05:18] <GeekMonkey> There are JS hooks
[13:06:12] <robertmaxrees> i'd try those then :)
[13:12:37] <GeekMonkey> there is nothing there to populate
[13:12:48] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:13:40] <GeekMonkey> Interesting on the field in the settings... there is an option to "Allow field to be populated dynamically"
[13:13:41] <GeekMonkey> Incoming Field Data
[13:13:41] <GeekMonkey> Check this option to enable data to be passed to the form and pre-populate this field dynamically. Data can be passed via Query Strings, Shortcode and/or Hooks.
[13:14:50] <GeekMonkey> it has an option to add parameter name
[13:14:59] <robertmaxrees> 'k
[13:15:20] <GeekMonkey> So I added a parameter name "dynamic_letter"
[13:17:41] <GeekMonkey> I can't use shortcode....I don't see how I would use hooks because there is no gravity form action happing as this is on a button click event outside the form
[13:18:10] <robertmaxrees> is gravity forms a paid for thing?
[13:18:53] <GeekMonkey> Ya.... I have been checking there documentation
[13:19:06] <robertmaxrees> do they offer support?
[13:19:09] <robertmaxrees> like, tech support.
[13:19:37] <robertmaxrees> 'cause I'd reach out to them for support at this point.
[13:19:50] <GeekMonkey> You can submit a ticket and hope for a response someday
[13:20:19] <robertmaxrees> :) my guess is you're much more likely to get a helpful response via that instead of here./
[13:26:44] <GeekMonkey> robertmaxrees I read this answer but not sure about the code as it is partial https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21052998/gravity-forms-populate-dynamically-via-ajax
[13:29:51] <robertmaxrees> okay?

[13:54:29] <robertmaxrees> yes
[13:56:35] <gambl0re> what did you think?
[13:56:44] <robertmaxrees> it was boring
[13:56:49] <gambl0re> who were you rooting for?
[13:56:52] <robertmaxrees> have anything OT to discuiss?
[13:57:12] <gambl0re> please dont tell me you're a tom brady fan...
[13:57:26] <robertmaxrees> i don't really care about football
[13:57:35] <robertmaxrees> did you have anything on topic to talk about? :)
[13:57:46] <gambl0re> :)
[13:58:24] <gambl0re> oh so you prefer basketball instead? i honestly though lakers would do better with lebron. but they're playing pretty bad this season
[13:58:30] <robertmaxrees> neither.
[13:58:39] <robertmaxrees> i don't really care for sports in general.
[13:58:47] <robertmaxrees> did you have anything OT to talk about?
[13:58:57] <gambl0re> but you like fishing right? i remember you told me you had a boat
[13:59:09] <robertmaxrees> please keep it on topic.  thanks!

[13:59:46] <gambl0re> no worries
[13:59:54] <bestdesign> just ask about topic :P
[14:00:03] <robertmaxrees> moving on then
[14:00:34] <gambl0re> just wanted to catch up with you. have fun at work
[14:19:13] <Devi8> what is the best way to filter for the widest element in a jquery collection?
[14:19:44] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17508556/get-widest-element-in-a-jquery-set/17508573#17508573
[14:20:02] <robertmaxrees> Devi8
[14:20:32] <Devi8> thank you.
[14:21:17] <robertmaxrees> :) surprising what all you can find with google/SOI
[14:21:18] <robertmaxrees> *SO
[14:21:19] <Devi8> that's how i was doing it, but I thought there would be a way to implement the same thing with filter easier
[14:21:29] <robertmaxrees> ah, nah not really.
[14:21:46] <Devi8> thanks
[14:21:56] <robertmaxrees> jquery's not really good when it comes to questions like that.
[14:22:27] <Devi8> how do you mean?
[14:23:08] <Devi8> or better yet, is there a better solution I should know about?
[14:23:08] <robertmaxrees> that's comparing elements based on styles, which usually isn't something you use jquery for.
[14:23:19] <robertmaxrees> css is generally what you want for that kind of work.
[14:24:12] <Devi8> I am trying to dynamically adjust the size of text on a slide when the slide size changes. I'm using the largest element relative to it's holder to dermine a scale that I apply to all the other elements
[14:24:29] <robertmaxrees> i'd rethink your css then.
[14:26:01] <Devi8> Yeah. I have. Just don't think I can ge the level of accuracy that I want with css without some massaging of the numbers.
[14:26:22] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[14:26:38] <Devi8> but thank you for your help, ntl
[15:44:19] <Devi8> vmin with em ftw. thanks for the suggestion robertmaxrees.
[15:44:26] <robertmaxrees> rad
