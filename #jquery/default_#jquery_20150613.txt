[08:56:53] <ParserError> hi all
[08:59:07] <ParserError> I have a div that loads content, and when I load another content in the same div the scroll does not reset it remains in the same place where it was recently lowered.
[09:03:47] <javascript630> hello, need help with jquery.let_it_snow.js
[09:05:18] <ParserError> I have a div that loads content, and when I load another content in the same div the scroll does not reset it remains in the same place where it was recently lowered.
[10:34:52] <adavia> can i do $this.find(':input').val('') ?
[11:03:00] <arc_> what is :input
[11:03:40] <arc_> input is an actual element so you don't need :
[11:16:05] <decx> it's a catchall for all input elements
[11:16:38] <arc_> isn't that the same as 'input'
[11:16:52] <decx> no
[11:16:57] <arc_> how is it different
[11:16:59] <decx> Description: Selects all input, textarea, select and button elements.
[11:17:09] <arc_> oh, weird
[11:17:59] <Uhkis> one of those special selectors

[12:50:52] <jurgentje> Hi... I have a script that counts the number of clicks (a survey), and after 50 clicks, a new page should be loaded. Is there a way to redirect the browser to a different page with jQuery?
[13:06:21] <Uhkis> plain js window.location = newpage should work just fine
[13:23:51] <arc_> is there an event for when you scroll past a hash manually
[13:24:48] <arc_> if not, how would you set up a scroll event to fire when you do scroll past a hash manually
[13:36:41] <arc_> nevermind, i think i'm going to try to do this without hashes
[14:00:44] <arc_> okay, i got that working
[14:00:52] <arc_> now here's another question
[14:00:59] <arc_> i'm trying to make an imgur userscript
[14:01:20] <arc_> basically i just want keyboard shortcuts to scroll directly to the prev/next image in the current gallery
[14:01:27] <arc_> got that done
[14:01:43] <arc_> but when there's a gallery of more than 10 images, it makes you click a link to load the rest of the gallery
[14:01:59] <arc_> i found the function that loads the images, but i'm not entirely sure how i can trigger it myself
[14:02:35] <Pistachio> Hi! Big newbie here, but I'm doing datatables with serverside processing, and have a question. { "data": "address", name: 'address' }, <- I need to have the zip code and city added to that. So instead of displaying "Willow Lane 123" it should display "Willow Lane 123, 9999 Somecity"
[14:02:36] <arc_> http://pastebin.com/2h4G5Jpj
[14:02:49] <arc_> this.loadFullAlbum() is what is doing it
[14:03:01] <arc_> but i'm not really sure what "this" is in that case
[14:03:36] <arc_> is it the anchor
[14:13:00] <arc_> nevermind, somebody said i should just click() the link, which is obviously the easiest solution
[14:13:08] <arc_> was thinking too much like a programmer
[18:19:46] <krainboltgreene> Uh, so I'm including jquery (latest), and it's defining $(), but not...jQuery?
[18:19:51] <krainboltgreene> Is that normal? That can't be normal.
[18:22:37] <arc_> what is the symptom
[18:23:59] <krainboltgreene> Bootstrap.js is complaining jQuery isn't defined, and when in the console jQuery isn't defined, however $() is definitely defined.
[18:24:51] <krainboltgreene> typeof $ // => "function"
[18:25:11] <krainboltgreene> typeof jQuery // => "undefined"
[18:25:22] <krainboltgreene> arc_: That help?
[18:25:39] <arc_> yes, but i don't have an answer for you :p
[18:26:10] <krainboltgreene> :(
[18:35:43] <Max-P> krainboltgreene: Are you sure jQuery is defined *before* bootstrap is loaded?
[18:42:53] <krainboltgreene> Max-P: Absolujtely
[18:43:16] <krainboltgreene> That's what's killing me because that's like the easiest problem to solve.
[18:43:35] <krainboltgreene> Max-P: Even if it was though, jQuery would still be defined, right?
[18:43:44] <Max-P> Yeah...
[18:43:58] <krainboltgreene> Is 2.1.4 weird in that way?
[18:46:03] <Max-P> Maybe you can try to add "jQuery = $;" before just in case and then figure out where jQuery is unset. But I don't know, I have not had the chance to use jQuery 2.x yet :/
[18:52:03] <Sal> hey guys, i have a strange thing here... i simply wrapped a form with a absolute backdrop div
[18:52:44] <Sal> the backdrop has a on click on it that unwraps and then closes the backdrop
[18:53:07] <Sal> the problem is that when i click on the form input field, the backdrop closes
[18:53:11] <Sal> it shouldn't
[18:53:20] <Sal> is iy because i'm using wrap?
[19:38:21] <cusiousmansi> how to extend the jquery plugin (the bootstrap.js dropdown plugin)
[21:52:12] <_genuser_> hello folks. tryhing to create a generic delete confirm box. Or even call it a confirmation box, using jquery. I have bootstrap included in the project also.
[21:52:51] <_genuser_> my idea is to have a generic form, where I can launch if when it is clicked by any button (each button is the delete button for that row in a rows of records display on screen).
[21:53:31] <_genuser_> but when the button is launched, I would like to modify the form, to include the ID, and a URL to post to, if delete/ok/submit it clicked.
[21:53:42] <_genuser_> not sure how to implement the last bit.
[22:07:37] <vdeep> _genuser_ are you using javascript confirm box?
[22:08:35] <cusiousmansi> 	cusiousmansi	anyone experts out there can take a glance over https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/js/dropdown.js and let me know how can i extend this
[22:08:43] <_genuser_> vdeep: no, using jquery modals _OR_ bootstrap modals, whichever I can get to work.
[22:09:21] <_genuser_> vdeep: js confirms are somethign I've done before and I'm comfortable doing that. it's just that if you're using jquery/ui or bootstrap, it's nicer to have it all in window in html with uniform ui.
[22:09:56] <Soni> how do I create a new DOM Element Object?
[22:10:35] <rcyr> var domObjectWrappedWithJQuery = $('<div class="lol"></div>');
[22:11:16] <Soni> oh I see
[22:11:37] <cusiousmansi> .on('keydown.bs.dropdown.data-api')
[22:11:46] <cusiousmansi> i read something like this somewhere
[22:12:06] <cusiousmansi> so manual says that first param is event
[22:12:18] <cusiousmansi> event is keydown
[22:12:21] <vdeep> _genuser_ I think you can use the show.bs.modal callback to get which button was clicked to show the modal
[22:12:30] <vdeep> _genuser_ http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals-events
[22:12:34] <rcyr> cusiousmansi: The event is probably the complete ugly string
[22:12:36] <cusiousmansi> what is  bs.dropdown.data-api' like
[22:12:58] <cusiousmansi> rcyr: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/js/dropdown.js
[22:13:05] <vdeep> You can then put the ID, url or anything in that button as data elements and get those in this event
[22:13:22] <cusiousmansi> where is that event created ?
[22:13:37] <_genuser_> vdeep: I see, thanks. I guess I'm on the right path. I already one a shown.bs.modal handler and I'm looking to retrieve additional attribute from the called button. I'm thinking that would be a nice way to pass data in. such as message to display, url to post to when ok is hit.
[22:14:12] <rcyr> cusiousmansi: You don't need to "create an event", you can just trigger whatever you want
[22:14:44] <rcyr> myNode.trigger('omglololol'); will work
[22:15:01] <rcyr> As long as you have something that binds to that event
[22:16:51] <_genuser_> vdeep: <button id="caller" custom-url="http://www.example.org">   can I not use jQuery to retrieve that custom-url?
[22:17:10] <_genuser_> vdeep: var caller=$(this); var url=caller.attr("custom-url");               in shown.bs.modal
[22:17:30] <vdeep> _genuser_ yes you can do that
[22:17:34] <rcyr> _genuser_: If "this" refers to the proper node, your code should work.
[22:17:40] <vdeep> not this
[22:17:52] <vdeep> you need to use relatedTarget
[22:17:57] <vdeep> of the event
[22:18:23] <vdeep> can you share your event code please?
[22:19:32] <bigLanky> I am looking for a jquery table sorter that will allow me to do all or most of the following: drag/drop columns to change order, show/hide certain columns, sort asc/desc,
[22:19:37] <bigLanky> anyone have a recommendation?
[22:20:44] <_genuser_> vdeep: sure, let me find the best place to load it.
[22:21:26] -fraguk- Free website hosting with PHP 5 enabled. More info or to apply visit https://www.criosphinx.net/
[22:21:36] <cusiousmansi> rcyr:  so the code here says something like   $(document).  on('keydown.bs.dropdown.data-api', '[role="menu"]', Dropdown.prototype.keydown) . So this will read as
[22:22:57] <cusiousmansi> in the document wherever we have selector collection like '[role="menu"]' attach the event 'keydown.bs.dropdown.data-api' with event handler Dropdown.prototype.keydown
[22:23:40] <cusiousmansi> but how the browser will understand that 'keydown.bs.dropdown.data-api' event has occured?
[22:23:52] <cusiousmansi> sorry looks like silly question
[22:23:59] <cusiousmansi> rcyr:
[22:25:05] <cusiousmansi> i have not seen trigger anywhere in this plugin code
[22:25:19] <cusiousmansi> even when we use the plugin we will not trigger that event
[22:25:30] <cusiousmansi> how the hell is this working then ?
[22:26:04] <_genuser_> vdeep: sorry, still trying to make it work somewhere like jsfiddle
[22:26:20] <rcyr> cusiousmansi: Let me see
[22:26:25] <vdeep> you can paste just the event code on pastebin _genuser_
[22:27:14] <cusiousmansi> https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/js/dropdown.js
[22:28:00] <cusiousmansi> also i have another question on 1) Dropdown.prototype.keydown  . If at all you got patience to check the code there
[22:28:09] <cusiousmansi> rcyr:
[22:29:44] <rcyr> cusiousmansi: I guess there has to be a bootstrap component that triggers it.
[22:30:11] <_genuser_> vdeep: http://jsfiddle.net/w045v4jr/1/
[22:30:28] <cusiousmansi> kool i will find out. Meanwhile the important question where i am stuck is on  Dropdown.prototype.keydown
[22:30:29] <rcyr> cusiousmansi: What you event handler does is listens on the document for events of type keydown.bs.dropdown.data-api fired from any node having the menu role
[22:30:45] <rcyr> cusiousmansi: What about it?
[22:32:00] <cusiousmansi> the first line of the code is something like     if (!/(38|40|27|32)/.test(e.which) || /input|textarea/i.test(e.target.tagName)) return
[22:32:36] <_genuser_> vdeep: so I figured out the first mistake is var caller=e.relatedTarget. It should be var caller=$(e.relatedTarget); but I wasn't able to hit caller.attr("custom-target") still.
[22:32:55] <vdeep> _genuser_ let me check
[22:33:11] <rcyr> It checks if some specific keys have been pressed or if the target of the event is an input or a textarea
[22:33:17] <cusiousmansi> here it will not go inside if the type="input" but in our case we have requirement to inside even if it is  input type . So basically i need to modify the code and get rid of input from that check .
[22:33:28] <cusiousmansi> yes exactly
[22:34:02] <cusiousmansi> but i can not modify this in bootstrap.js file. I should be extending the functionality of this bootstarp jquery plugin
[22:34:09] <cusiousmansi> what is the way to this
[22:34:23] <cusiousmansi> to extend the jquery plugin we have jQuery.fn.extend
[22:35:03] <cusiousmansi> how i can extend or modify the bootstarp js plugin which itself is the jQuery plugin
[22:35:22] <cusiousmansi> looking at the code and knowledge of OOjavascript should help
[22:35:56] <cusiousmansi> but i have not much experience writing javascript code i am not able to figure that ourt
[22:37:10] <rcyr> cusiousmansi: You could patch the function but that would be ugly...
[22:37:20] <rcyr> Consider simply forking that file
[22:37:46] <_genuser_> vdeep: ok, I see I can use the data-* data binding to pass in the values to the function. So I have it working now. thanks for pointing me in teh right direction with bootstrap.
[22:38:04] <cusiousmansi> means you are telling that making the copy of the bootstarp.js
[22:38:19] <vdeep> _genuser_ yes using data- binding is the jQuery preferred way
[22:38:19] <cusiousmansi> and then changing that function
[22:38:28] <vdeep> glad you figured it out
[22:38:32] <_genuser_> vdeep: ok, so that's jquery and not bootstrap?
[22:38:45] <vdeep> yes, data- attributes are available in jQuery
[22:38:53] <cusiousmansi> i don't think that it will be doable as others in the team will not know about it
[22:39:08] <_genuser_> vdeep: nice, thanks. since I'm using both, it's hard to know which ability is from which framework and what I'm really learning. :)
[22:39:17] <vdeep> :)
[22:39:32] <_genuser_> but we all know, "get it working first, then worry about other stuff".
[22:39:52] <vdeep> bootstrap also used many data- bindings to automate things
[22:39:56] <rcyr> cusiousmansi: If you can't just monkey patch bootstrap.
[22:40:36] <_genuser_> vdeep: yeah, I see on the bootstrap page some examples use that. I guess I'll revisit the jquery tutorial that I had started months ago.
[22:41:23] <rcyr> cusiousmansi: It would be something along the lines of: $.fn.dropdown.Constructor.prototype.Keydown = youyReplacementFunction;
[22:41:33] <cusiousmansi> what is monkey patch and why we can not extend it and say of(that event) and i will attach my event handler on that
[22:41:50] <cusiousmansi> Oh kool let me try
[23:08:29] <walabe> hello
[23:08:40] <walabe> Trying to implement this: http://nick-jonas.github.io/threesixtyjs/ how do I reference my images??
[23:11:11] <walabe> <div class="threesixty" data-path="assets/img/src/gem{index}.JPG" data-count="61"></div> or what does the data path bit mean?
