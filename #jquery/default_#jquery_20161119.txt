[08:40:08] <szwetsloot> Hey guys. I am trying to make a page with multiple sortable list. At the top the user has a numeric input which allows him to add / remove lists. I want to dynamically create the lists which should the be able to exchange items.
[08:40:15] <szwetsloot> I have tried to this: $('ul').sortable({ connectWith: 'ul' });
[08:40:39] <szwetsloot> However, this causes the lists to only be sortable within themselves. They can't exchange.
[08:40:42] <szwetsloot> How can I do this?
[08:42:16] <szwetsloot> If I place a dummy object in the dynamically created lists it seems to work. But I want to do it without the dummy
[08:46:37] <szwetsloot> Anyone?
[09:33:09] <qakhan> hi all, i have a table (t1) with rows. i have another table (t2) with rows.
[09:33:44] <qakhan> i want to add t1 rows under t2 rows but selecting them
[09:35:09] <qakhan> if 1 selected row 2 on t2 then i want to add t1 rows to under t2 row2
[09:35:17] <qakhan> here is my code https://jsfiddle.net/okz8oc09/15/
[09:36:48] <qakhan> rows goes to t2 but it is adding in whole table , no matter if i select t2 rows or not
[11:41:31] <Deusdeorum> why does my .get not log the feed that is returned? https://jsfiddle.net/fwd6bsvn/
[11:42:03] <Deusdeorum> response does indeed return "[{"limit":8,"start":5,"stop":8}]" when checking the call in chrome
[11:42:16] <Deusdeorum> keep getting undefined
[11:54:25] <taplar> for that stringify result?
[11:56:59] <Deusdeorum> yes?
[11:57:02] <Deusdeorum> or what?
[11:57:36] <taplar> what id 'feed' if you console log just that?
[11:57:39] <taplar> *is
[11:58:25] <Deusdeorum> feed = [{"limit":8,"start":5,"stop":8}]
[11:59:03] <taplar> that's what the console.log logs?
[11:59:38] <Deusdeorum> no, logs undefined, but the response when checking the network is actually the feed
[11:59:59] <taplar> right, but if you console.log(feed) what do you get?
[12:00:12] <taplar> not the stringify, just the variable
[12:00:39] <Deusdeorum> i do not get anything, i still get undefined
[12:00:52] <taplar> hmm
[12:01:11] <taplar> have you tried moving the function to the third parameter of the $.get() ?
[12:02:13] <Deusdeorum> nopes, new to ajax calls, but this should be an easy call right? maybe misleading  you, the HTTP response show [{"limit":8,"start":5,"stop":8}]
[12:02:29] <taplar> no i understand what you are saying
[12:02:35] <taplar> but the api for get shows: jQuery.get( url [, data ] [, success ] [, dataType ] )
[12:02:49] <taplar> as it is you have a success callback in the data, like if you were using $.ajax
[12:02:56] <taplar> but $.get may not like that, *shrug*
[12:03:53] <Deusdeorum> hmm, okey, better use $.ajax? or what is the difference?
[12:04:12] <taplar> $.get() is a wrapper for $.ajax.  it's just a convenience method
[12:04:33] <taplar> either work.  personally i stick with the real deal usually, :)
[12:05:22] <taplar> http://www.james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.get
[12:05:40] <taplar> yeah so look at that guy
[12:05:48] <taplar> towards the bottom you'll see how it uses the data
[12:07:29] <Deusdeorum> but, that's exactly what i do though?
[12:07:46] <taplar> no look, 'data' to get() is the second parameter passed in
[12:07:50] <taplar> which has your success in it.
[12:07:58] <taplar> it's not putting the succes on the success it makes
[12:08:45] <taplar> so yeah, try doing https://jsfiddle.net/fwd6bsvn/1/ instead
[12:13:07] <Deusdeorum> ye, that works fine, thank you.. I did not really think this one through
[12:13:43] <Deusdeorum> didn't think it was that senesetive but it obviously makes sense
[12:13:54] <taplar> :)
[12:14:04] <taplar> wrappers usually make some assumptions
[14:49:03] <glowdemon1> Hi.
[15:02:30] <Deusdeorum> how can I create lots of HTML with jquery? https://jsfiddle.net/sdvxc2ng/2/
[15:59:16] <splash_wave> anyone here to answer a question?
[16:11:55] <rhizome> ask and find out
[17:08:58] <arc_> my bank's website was updated, and now the login box doesn't exist when you load the page, it fades in a couple seconds later -_-

[19:36:33] <rickygervais> #jquery
[20:00:49] <rickygervais> hi guys
[20:01:13] <rickygervais> I'm trying to ouput nested json data into HTML lists
[20:01:27] <rickygervais> here is my jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/qL1rtkmm/
[20:01:49] <rickygervais> here is the JSON url: https://api.myjson.com/bins/1p2ly
[20:02:05] <rickygervais> can anyone help?
[20:02:26] <rickygervais> I'm trying to get several levels deep like: sports > leagues > events > competitions > competitors
[20:03:22] <Utils> I'm having a scope issue with events. Line 16 and 17 refer to different objects: https://gist.github.com/JTallis/ad98bf9159ec654e32291c919fe8263d line 16 works, without even testing I know line 17 will not. I can fix this by doing this.onLinkClick.bind(this) but then I won't be able to do $(this) so any suggestions?
[20:04:41] <rickygervais> o
[20:04:53] <rickygervais> i'm getting errors for some reason on my code
[20:05:13] <rickygervais> simply trying to output the values of the arrays in each object
[20:06:15] <Utils> rickygervais: for starters, lines 6 to 13 should probably be in the success function. and I'm not sure why you're trying to parse json, $.getJSON parses it for you and returns an object.
[20:08:20] <rickygervais> I see..
[20:08:35] <rickygervais> let me try
[20:09:08] <rickygervais> I'm trying to output the value to HTML though
[20:12:46] <rickygervais> Utils:  hmm I'm having trouble putting it into success handler
[20:12:54] <rickygervais> isn't it already in it
[20:12:56] <rickygervais> ?
[20:13:09] <rickygervais> according to http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/
[20:13:21] <Utils> not in your jsfiddle no, it was after it.
[20:13:33] <Utils> https://jsfiddle.net/qL1rtkmm/1/ this hsould get you moving
[20:15:16] <Utils> you'll need more $.each's inside of that one though as the values have data too and so on.
[20:15:34] <Utils> but it's a start.
[20:16:55] <rickygervais> ok let me check it
[20:21:38] <rickygervais> Utils: that's awesome thanks
[20:21:52] <rickygervais> Utils:  how would I get deeper in terms of nested data
[20:21:55] <rickygervais> for example
[20:22:03] <rickygervais> sports > leagues > events > competitions > competitors
[20:24:26] <Utils> that's where you need more $.eaches inside
[20:24:35] <rickygervais> I'd like to get more specific
[20:24:35] <Utils> inside that one you can do: console.dir(v);
[20:24:38] <Utils> and see what you get in the console
[20:24:57] <Utils> and then you'd do something like $.each(v, function(..) { ... });
[20:24:59] <Utils> and so on
[20:25:27] <rickygervais> ok
[20:35:56] <rickygervais> Utils: console.dir(v) worked
[20:36:04] <rickygervais> but I only got one level deep
[20:36:21] <rickygervais> how would I write it spit out 2 levels deep from the json?
[20:37:52] <rickygervais> let me be more spefic..
[20:37:54] <rickygervais> specific*
[20:41:58] <rickygervais> in the example you gave
[20:42:09] <rickygervais> success is the value of "status"
[20:43:02] <rickygervais> I want to grab the keys and values of the fifth object
[20:43:06] <rickygervais> not the first one
[20:43:20] <rickygervais> so it would be something like this
[20:44:19] <rickygervais> the key/value pairs of 'competitors'
[20:44:50] <rickygervais> which would be:
[20:45:02] <rickygervais>  "competitors": [{ "type": "team", "score": 7,
[20:49:49] <Utils> http://prntscr.com/d9g3qh It's all there
[20:50:09] <Utils> just need to loop through it all. it's a very huge object.
[20:50:12] <rickygervais> it's all there
[20:50:15] <Utils> it's almost never ending
[20:50:33] <rickygervais> but what code would I need to dig in to it specific and print out the html
[20:50:53] <rickygervais> right now it just prints out the 1st level
[20:51:47] <rickygervais> the data is there.. but I'm just trying to figure what code to dig in deeper and print out those values
[20:52:22] <rickygervais> I got this: https://jsfiddle.net/qL1rtkmm/3/
[20:52:31] <rickygervais> which spits out the keys and values of the first level
[20:53:05] <rickygervais> which I got from you... so let's say I want the 5th object with those key/value pairs
[20:54:38] <rickygervais> Utils: https://jsfiddle.net/qL1rtkmm/3/
[21:01:16] <Utils> This is what I mean: https://jsfiddle.net/qL1rtkmm/4/ although that's probably not the best way.
[21:01:26] <rickygervais> ok checking
[21:01:38] <Utils> you'd have to go super super super nested and that would probably just be horrid
[21:04:10] <Utils> https://jsfiddle.net/qL1rtkmm/5/ this also where theres less nesting but you may need to check if any of those keys actually exist
[21:04:59] <rickygervais> ok
[21:05:58] <rickygervais> Utils: this one might be onto something my friend! https://jsfiddle.net/qL1rtkmm/5/
[21:06:03] <rickygervais> double checking
[21:06:10] <rickygervais> this one is a lot cleaner and specific
[21:09:21] <rickygervais> Thank you sir!
[21:09:41] <rickygervais> Utils: appreciate it! I'm going to keep working on this
[21:21:43] <Utils> https://jsfiddle.net/qL1rtkmm/6/
[21:21:52] <Utils> idk just work your way through in what way you think is best
[21:21:58] <Utils> it's a huuuuuge object
[21:22:03] <rickygervais> Utils: one last question
[21:23:55] <rickygervais> https://jsfiddle.net/qL1rtkmm/5/ this is on the right track
[21:26:57] <rickygervais> actuallyu
[21:27:04] <rickygervais> actually I think i got it :)
[21:37:45] <rickygervais> Utils: if you look at the json data you'll notice
[21:37:52] <rickygervais> there are 16 events
[21:38:12] <rickygervais> would there be a way to make a loop to spit out all 16 at once
[21:38:16] <rickygervais> like this:
[21:40:41] <rickygervais> print out all 16 scores
[21:40:44] <rickygervais> in: $.each(data.sports[0].leagues[0].events[0].competitions[0].competitors[0].score
[21:42:20] <rickygervais> the bigger picture of this
[21:42:34] <rickygervais> is i'm trying to build a scoreboard
[21:42:51] <rickygervais> there are 16 events.. which means there are 2 scores and 2 teams
[21:43:24] <rickygervais> i'm on the right track with this now $.each(data.sports[0].leagues[0].events[0].competitions[0].competitors[0]
[21:43:37] <rickygervais> so I think the next step is build a loop right?
[21:43:42] <rickygervais> Utils: what do you think?
[21:48:05] <rickygervais> i'm doing some google in the meantime
[22:32:54] <rickygervais> Utils: please check this https://jsfiddle.net/qL1rtkmm/7/
[22:33:16] <rickygervais> I'm getting close and if you check console.log(this) it's getting the right information
[22:33:21] <rickygervais> but I'm not able to print the html here
[22:33:28] <rickygervais> please check that latest jsfiddle
