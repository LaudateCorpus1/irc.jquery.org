[03:50:31] <Mewster> Hello
[03:51:37] <Mewster> If I have myTable.row.add( [1,a]), myTable.row.add( [2,a]), myTable.row.add( [3,b]), how can I check before adding myTable.row.add( [2,b]) whether a row with column[0]==2?
[03:51:47] <Mewster> already exists?
[03:51:49] <Mewster> *
[03:56:44] <Cork> that is a very specific plugin question so you should prob find a support for them specifically
[03:58:25] <Mewster> Oh
[03:58:39] <Mewster> Sorry, didn't know there were specific chans for specific plugins
[03:58:48] <Mewster> Where can I find the chan list?
[03:59:03] <Cork> Mewster: i didn't say there was, just that you're not very likely to get an answer here
[03:59:11] <Mewster> ...oh ahaha
[03:59:49] <Cork> as long as the question can be connection to generic jquery behaviour it can fairly easily be answered
[04:00:16] <Cork> but in this case it is specifically how you work with the plugin, and you have to be lucky and find another user to get help
[04:00:19] <Robdgreat> if this is datatables, I assume they still don't have irc support
[04:00:33] <Robdgreat> as of a few years ago they had no intention of providing that
[04:00:35] <Cork> so i would recommend checking the plugins site if they have a forum or something like that
[04:05:50] <Mewster> ok thanks
[11:01:31] <xeon_kyo> hello! :) i need a little help... i stucked with a basic problem
[11:02:00] <xeon_kyo> i want to hide an element ( iframe ) when i scrolled to #id
[12:09:53] <pSouper> hey all o/
[12:09:58] <pSouper> i'm beat.
[12:10:20] <robertmaxrees> morning
[12:10:37] <pSouper> i'm trying to ajax a post request to a crm and am being knocked back with a CORS error
[12:11:00] <robertmaxrees> you need to properly configure the server hosting the crm.
[12:11:02] <pSouper> i've used every client side trick i can think of
[12:11:18] <robertmaxrees> right - the issue isn't something you can resolve client-side.
[12:11:19] <pSouper> damn... no other way around? tried jsonp ...nothing
[12:11:31] <pSouper> ok. thanks @robertmaxrees
[12:11:37] <robertmaxrees> jsonp only works for GET requests, and only if the other server supports it.
[12:12:33] <pSouper> the thing is that the post gets through and is adding my data to the crm fin, it's just not giving me a success response. i tihnk i'll ignor ethe response and just pop up a thank you message anyways :D
[12:12:44] <robertmaxrees> eh
[12:12:50] <robertmaxrees> are you sure it's a CORS issue?
[12:12:52] <pSouper> agreed on your jsonp point
[12:13:05] <robertmaxrees> lol

[12:13:25] <robertmaxrees> ah.  alright.
[12:13:38] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't rely on that behavior.
[12:13:58] <pSouper> i wouldn't either...that's why i've spen an hour trying to work around it :D
[12:14:15] <robertmaxrees> don't just pop a confirmation dialog.  fix the server config.
[12:14:18] <robertmaxrees> or find a better solution.
[12:15:23] <pSouper> i'd love to find better way. i just can't get my hands on the remote server for a week or so
[12:15:36] <robertmaxrees> then hold off for a week :)
[12:15:44] <pSouper> feck it - i'll put a support request in and let someone else fix that side
[12:15:51] <pSouper> lol ypu. will do
[12:15:54] <pSouper> ty
[12:24:37] <robertparkerx> is it possible to go to next input on down keydown and previous input on up kkeydown?
[12:24:52] <robertmaxrees> "up keydown" lol
[12:25:04] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean the arrow keys robertparkerx ?
[12:25:09] <robertparkerx> Yes sorry
[12:25:27] <robertmaxrees> any reason the usual tab key isn't enough?
[12:26:35] <robertparkerx> no reason other than they want me to do it this way
[12:26:39] <robertmaxrees> :|
[12:27:24] <robertmaxrees> you can do it, it's just a bad idea :) i'd use tabIndex and check which one you're current in, then select or filter off that.
[12:29:24] <robertparkerx> So set a tabindex?/
[12:29:36] <robertmaxrees> are you familiar with the tabindex property?
[12:29:38] <robertparkerx> Or does it already have it in the DOM
[12:29:50] <robertmaxrees> i would explicitly set it
[12:29:54] <robertparkerx> No I'm reading it now
[12:29:55] <robertmaxrees> in your html.
[12:30:03] <robertparkerx> Oh
[12:33:36] <robertparkerx> can't I use .next and .prev
[12:34:14] <robertmaxrees> without seeing your html, no clue.
[12:34:23] <robertmaxrees> if the inputs aren't direct siblings, no.
[12:34:41] <robertmaxrees> but relying on .prev() and .next() is a shaky proposition - tabindex will be much more deterministic
[12:35:32] <robertparkerx> The only problem is this is output by a shortcode. There could be many shortcodes displayed on one page.
[12:35:44] <robertmaxrees> no idea what that means, but OK.
[12:36:03] <robertmaxrees> then you'll need to manually traverse the dom to do this.
[12:36:39] <pavonia> lol, two long nick roberts are hard to follow
[12:36:41] <robertparkerx> Can I add a class to the inputs and do a each to set the tabindex?
[12:36:57] <robertmaxrees> wait lol - you can add a class but you can't add a tabindex??
[12:37:00] <robertmaxrees> so confused now
[12:37:29] <robertparkerx> I can add the tabindex but they would be the same for every shortcode
[12:37:52] <robertmaxrees> whatcha mean by "shortcode"?
[12:38:08] <robertmaxrees> most templating engines have some kind of index when looping through things to render.
[12:38:30] <robertparkerx> https://d.pr/i/4aznIM
[12:38:52] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:39:03] <robertparkerx> the function display each and each function is the shortcode
[12:39:13] <robertmaxrees> what templating engine is this?
[12:39:19] <robertparkerx> WordPress
[12:40:19] <robertmaxrees> aaaaaaahhhh
[12:40:45] <robertmaxrees> yeah, then it sounds like you're just gonna need to do manual dom traversal here.
[12:49:51] <robertparkerx> I'm going too try your first suggestion and using tabindex but set it dynamic
[12:50:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:50:49] <robertmaxrees> you're just adding an extra step but okie :)
[12:51:40] <robertparkerx> Okay I got them set
[13:29:02] <robertparkerx> Thanks robertmaxrees. I got it working with tabindex
[16:20:22] <robertthethird> yeah
[16:23:01] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:23:17] <taplar> ah, just read the logs with all the roberts.  i wanted to play too... i guess
[16:23:24] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:25:30] <taplar> got my mic in.  loving it.
[16:26:29] <robertmaxrees> niiiice
[16:27:25] <taplar> it's like i found some dbz and made a wish, cause now everyone can hear what i'm super saaaaaayyyyiiiiiin!  *boom*
[16:27:45] <robertmaxrees> oh jfc.
[16:27:49] <taplar> lmao
