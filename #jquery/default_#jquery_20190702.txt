[03:41:03] <haroldjfks> Ciao a tutti :)
[03:41:30] <haroldjfks> hello, I have an issue with clearInterval();
[03:42:48] <haroldjfks> eg. I'm on a loaded page, then click on a pagination button, I do something like hide a div...but then If i use clearInterval(); for the setInterval the next time I click on the pagination button, it doesn't reset the interval...
[03:46:44] <haroldjfks> here the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/morx1y8L/
[03:46:51] <haroldjfks> where's wrong, please?
[03:47:36] <haroldjfks> obviously here is not the whole example, because on the production page when you click on the pagination button, the "myText" li appears again...
[03:47:40] <haroldjfks> that's it
[03:54:59] <Cork> haroldjfks: you have the reference variable for setInterval inside the click handler
[03:55:25] <Cork> so it will be different for each click
[03:56:09] <Cork> (also setInterval for animations are normally a bad idea)
[04:14:13] <haroldjfks> Cork: so, what's the solution? clearInterval(); without handler? what?
[04:17:41] <Cork> haroldjfks: store it in a variable cross click events
[04:18:05] <Cork> and run a reset before you start a new reset (at minimum)
[04:18:36] <Cork> i also recommend having a look at requestAnimationFrame, so you can be a bit resource smart and not animate the page when not needed
[04:19:07] <haroldjfks> pardon, var storeTimeInterval...so why that variable is not set at any click?
[04:19:20] <haroldjfks> can you edit the fiddle, please?
[04:19:32] <Cork> haroldjfks: it is, but it is for each call to setInterval
[04:19:46] <Cork> as each click gets its own instance of the variable
[04:31:48] <haroldjfks> Cork: "store it in a variable cross click events" well, that's not clear how you mean...and how...
[04:32:19] <Cork> haroldjfks: put the variable declaration outside the clickhandler so you don't get one copy for each call
[04:44:00] <haroldjfks> this seems correct, but I would like a confirmation http://jsfiddle.net/g3pufozy/
[04:44:47] <Cork> you don't need = null on line 1
[04:44:53] <Cork> but except for that; sure
[04:46:12] <haroldjfks> http://jsfiddle.net/g3pufozy/1/ no, that's incorrect, I have the console full of console log for "now hidden" even if I don't click anything
[04:46:52] <Cork> well you have to stop the interval when it is done
[04:47:06] <Cork> that is another reason why setInterval is normally a bad idea
[08:13:04] <haroldjfks> Ciao a tutti :P
[10:02:54] <haroldjfks> Ciao a tutti :)
[10:52:31] <MikeD_> removeAttr('title') ... should that be prop('title', ??? )
[10:53:18] <robertmaxrees> removeProp()
[10:53:19] <robertmaxrees> :)
[10:53:45] <MikeD_> hmm.  thanks.  that seems weird
[10:53:51] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[10:53:52] <MikeD_> i know, it is what it is
[10:54:28] <MikeD_> i would have made the 'turn this off' by making it value of false or undefined... so i didn't need the removeProp method at all
[10:54:39] <MikeD_> ... and stick with the prop get/set motif
[10:54:55] <robertmaxrees> not sure I follow, but alright :)
[10:55:39] <MikeD_> yeah, i don't care either, tbh  :)
[10:55:44] <robertmaxrees> heh
[10:55:47] <robertmaxrees> alright
[11:44:06] <compact> Hi. Have jQuery script and on the return I change  value of about 10 fields. Is it better to do this, or make the API return a HTML?
[11:44:35] <robertmaxrees> compact you mean use .val() vs rendering out inputs with value set?
[11:44:51] <taplar> my opinion, the api should return data, and let the frontend generate the html
[11:44:54] <compact> yes robertmaxrees
[11:45:01] <robertmaxrees> compact can you show us what your code looks like?
[11:45:15] <compact> 3 lines:
[11:45:17] <compact> $('#order_information input[name=reference_code]').val(data.reference_code);
[11:45:18] <robertmaxrees> because there are two very different versions of what you're doing.
[11:45:42] <robertmaxrees> yeah, let your frontend set the values.  don'
[11:45:48] <robertmaxrees> *don't return markup from an API.
[11:46:14] <compact> why's that? not disagreeing with you, just keen to k now a bit more info
[11:46:15] <robertmaxrees> (I assume by "API" you mean some kind of server call)
[11:46:29] <compact> correct robertmaxrees
[11:46:37] <taplar> imo, apis should typically be agnostic
[11:46:44] <taplar> their data could be used in multiple cases
[11:46:46] <robertmaxrees> ^ your API shouldn't be concerned with implementation details.
[11:46:57] <compact> agreed 100%
[11:46:59] <robertmaxrees> ie it shouldn't care about how the data will be used.  it should just give you data.
[11:47:19] <compact> makes sense, guess I just read some stuff on some other ways
[11:47:20] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're tightly coupling server-side logic to client-side presentation, which is generally not a good idea.
[11:47:25] <robertmaxrees> like?
[11:47:43] <compact> agreed. would be handy to use the API for other calls, rather then tweaking each controller
[11:48:00] <compact> well passing the HTML code through the API and just setting HTML with the value
[11:48:14] <taplar> it's also less data transfer to return just the data
[11:48:28] <taplar> depending on your site activity, could be an issue
[11:48:58] <compact> i'm looking at doing this base project, then doing it in angular
[11:49:20] <taplar> "then doing" meaning rewrite?
[11:49:32] <compact> yup
[11:49:42] <taplar> is there a reason?
[11:50:04] <taplar> jQuery no framework projects don't really port one to one to angular
[11:50:37] <compact> yeah but focus to get base version up. won't use jQuery with angular
[11:50:45] <compact> planning to use AWS serverless to host the angular
[11:51:26] <taplar> i'd really encourage you to start out on the platform you're going to end up on, but that on you, :)
[11:52:04] <compact> i wish, but site needs to be live in 2 weeks. not sure i could get it that quick in angular
[11:52:11] <taplar> ah
[11:52:12] <robertmaxrees> to be fair, sometimes you just need to get an MVP out the door.
[11:52:23] <robertmaxrees> hah, beat me to it.
[11:52:24] <taplar> yeah, deadlines suck
[11:52:35] <compact> nothing worse lol
[11:52:43] <robertmaxrees> even if there aren't deadlines.  we do stuff like that all the time.
[11:53:01] <robertmaxrees> build out the base version, prove the idea.  rewrite, refactor, and add to it if it's working.
[11:53:02] <compact> one option is to build base site, get freelancers to start to convert into angular
[11:53:14] <compact> however too many shonky freelancers out there
[11:54:06] <taplar> we're in the middle of a heavy rewrite of a large part of one of our applications into angular.  it's a headache making sure the new screen(s) have all the functionality of the old screens.  main reason i suggest starting out on the end platform
[11:55:05] <compact> ah true. would be painful. hoping to make the base pretty slim, so can catchup to angular fast enough and just work from there
[11:55:34] <compact> with AWS etc, crazy not to use angular. espically when AWS can scale frontend etc easily, and all need to do is maintain backend ec2
[11:56:05] <robertmaxrees> taplar i would counter that sometimes you're not sure what exactly you'll even need - you might find that the platform you were eyeing for down the road isn't actually a great choice :)
[11:56:06] <taplar> is the scaling frontend with a non-scaling backend not a concern?
[11:56:31] <taplar> robertmaxrees sure, i'm just coming from it from the standpoint of an existing app, :).  new apps, completely different
[11:56:31] <compact> backend will be scaled
[11:57:13] <compact> backend will be on ec2 load balancer
[11:58:46] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean by "can scale frontend etc easily"?
[11:59:15] <robertmaxrees> like, what about an angular (or any other similarly frameworked) app needs that?
[12:01:05] <compact> well if angular is put into a s3 bucket, aws handles the loads etc
[12:01:17] <robertmaxrees> are you rendering server-side?
[12:02:18] <compact> angular to do all API calls with javascript. laravel/php for backend
[12:56:17] <taplar> i should make a frontend application that takes pictures and transforms them into lizards
[12:57:03] <taplar> call it a scaling app
[12:59:17] <taplar> though in retrospect, an app that takes pictures and turns people into lizards, i guess facebook already exists
[13:02:48] <nedbat> i;'ve got some jquery code that i tested with qunit. When i run the tests on firefox, the page won't scroll, in a strange way.  when i run in chrome, the entire browser freezes up, and I have to discard my settings to restart it.  I must be doing something wrong, but I don't know what: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/blob/master/tests/js/index.html
[14:20:13] <robertmaxrees> nedbat without downloading and running the project, I would start setting breakpoints and seeing when things fall apart.
[14:38:38] <taplar> nedbat +1000 though for writing unit tests
[14:45:54] <haroldjfks> saaalve!!!

[14:58:02] <haroldjfks> Ciao a tutti :)))
[14:58:16] <robertmaxrees> gesundheit
[14:58:23] <taplar> lol
[14:58:55] <taplar> where's your don't say hello link?
[14:59:07] <robertmaxrees> nohello.com :)
[14:59:14] * taplar sighs
[15:00:25] <robertmaxrees> haroldjfks did you have a question?
[15:20:18] <taplar> nope
[15:20:55] <robertmaxrees> welp
[18:24:12] <haroldjfks> sorry, I had the auto greeting on...lol bye for now
[18:24:25] <robertmaxrees> :(
[18:42:34] <pavonia> Imagine what a wonderful place IRC would be if everyone had an auto-greeting feature enabled in their clients
[18:42:42] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[18:42:58] <robertmaxrees> i shudder at the thought.
[20:54:27] <Jonno_FTW> hello
[20:54:59] <robertmaxrees> hello
[20:57:33] <robertmaxrees> nohello.com
[20:57:35] <robertmaxrees> :)
[21:02:38] <Jonno_FTW> how do I get the children of an element except the first?
[21:03:03] <robertmaxrees> depends on your markup.
[21:03:11] <robertmaxrees> mind making a quick fiddle?
[21:03:35] <Jonno_FTW> I have a tr with td, I want the tds except the first in the row
[21:03:42] <robertmaxrees> show me :)
[21:05:59] <Jonno_FTW> robertmaxrees: the answer was :gt(0)
[21:06:13] <robertmaxrees> i would've done .children().not(':first')
[21:06:16] <robertmaxrees> since that's much clearer.
[21:06:23] <robertmaxrees> or add classes to things to identify 'em.
[21:06:32] <robertmaxrees> buuuuuut :shrug:
[21:06:32] <robertmaxrees> gg
[21:06:37] <Jonno_FTW> ez
[21:06:48] <robertmaxrees> so easy you had to ask for help :3
[21:07:32] <Jonno_FTW> yeah well in the time waiting for help I was looking
[21:07:45] <robertmaxrees> lol it's all good.
[21:36:25] <Jonno_FTW> I have a problem
[21:36:37] <Jonno_FTW> where I set a border-right on a td, but it doesn't show when next to a hidden cell
[21:36:56] <robertmaxrees> i'd ask in #css
[21:37:24] <Jonno_FTW> yea
[21:51:12] <Jonno_FTW> I solved it
[21:51:15] <Jonno_FTW> without css
[21:51:19] <robertmaxrees> ?
[22:08:16] <robertmaxrees> welp
