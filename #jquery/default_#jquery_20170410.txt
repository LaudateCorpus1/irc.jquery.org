[01:29:54] <Saint_Isadore> Hello, I'm having a little issue. I want to make sure a checkbox gets unselected. I tried .attr('checked', false) and .prop('checked', false). but neither seem to do the trick. ANy thoughts?
[02:40:41] <Al_nz1> I need to make a logout option on a menu work via logout? https://hastebin.com/hezelaboca.js
[02:40:48] <Al_nz1> do I need to use jquery to do this?
[04:39:09] <Unbeerable> I'm trying to setup $(document).ajaxError() handler and it called twice on a single request. Why?
[04:39:41] <Unbeerable> I'm trying to compare event and jqxhr objects passed to the handler and they looks the same
[04:49:45] <m9l> Hey! I can't figure out why this variable returns Undefined. Does anyone know what causes this? Driving me crazy :D  https://pastebin.com/WtafhVFk
[05:01:56] <FilipNortic_> m9l: the return get executed before the ajax request completes
[05:02:56] <FilipNortic_> don't put alerts use console.log() and but one before the return an one instead of the alert then you can see the order of execution
[05:03:08] <FilipNortic_> s/but/put
[05:05:49] <FilipNortic_> Unbeerable: have you checked that it called twice of the ame request?
[05:10:53] <m9l> Okey thanks! I heard in another channel I need to use a callback to solve it :)
[05:11:31] <FilipNortic_> yeah i lokked in the js channel after i wrote here
[05:11:45] <m9l> :)
[05:13:17] <FilipNortic_> and yes you need to put everything that needs the variable in a block you know gets executed after the ajax is done so either a direct callback or a when/then block
[05:14:24] <FilipNortic_> m9l:  new people can sometimes get confued and try and use sync ajax or wirte race condtional code with setTimestamp. You don't wanna do either of those
[05:14:35] <Unbeerable> FilipNortic_, it's definitely the same request
[05:14:53] <Unbeerable> I'm passing a custom parameter to .ajax options to check it on error
[05:15:50] <Unbeerable> I made a workaround for the issue, adding myCustomParamProcessed to settings object in .ajaxError and checking if this flag is already set
[05:18:40] <FilipNortic_> Unbeerable: that sounds like you're binding 2 handlers to document
[05:19:32] <FilipNortic_> but i guess there could be some non trivial thing aswell but i can't think of anything
[05:21:30] <Unbeerable> you saved my time, I occasionally included same JS file twice :)
[05:21:32] <Unbeerable> thank you
[05:24:08] <arup_r> Say I have a link <a href="/contacts" class="load-contacts-js"> Load Contacts </a> . Now, what I want is, on click on this link, I want to add a query param to this link like ?name='arup' and then let the link to make GET request as it does. How to acvieve this?
[05:31:41] <FilipNortic_> arup_r: well you can bind a click event to the element and run with preventDefault() on the event then you can do anything you like in js
[05:32:42] <arup_r> FilipNortic_: yup then I will navigate via window.location = "url" .. this is what I am trying now
[05:39:04] <m9l> FilipNortic_, I'm trying to solve this callback thing. I think I'm close to a solution ;) Do you know why the render_confirmation_email is not called here after the successful get request? For some reason it's not called.
[05:40:58] <FilipNortic_> m9l: since i can't remember seeing more code then the get request. No
[05:41:58] <m9l> https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/resources/templates/report-template-usability-test-short.html
[05:42:02] <m9l> oh no wrong
[05:42:07] <m9l> https://pastebin.com/xssJ9iHA
[05:42:31] <m9l> Sorry, I forgot to add the pastebin link!
[05:42:54] <FilipNortic_> m9l: stop using alerts and use console.log instead it's much better
[05:43:26] <FilipNortic_> and do you see the success dialog?
[05:44:29] <m9l> Yes
[05:44:46] <m9l> But not the alert in the render_confirmation_email
[05:48:07] <m9l> I removed the parameter render_confirmation_email in get_confirmation_email and now it gets called!
[05:49:04] <FilipNortic_> m9l: one of the benefits of using console.log instead of alert is that i will force you to open the console
[05:51:16] <m9l> True, I didn't get any error message in the console though. Maybe it's supposed to be like that in the javascript world? ;)
[06:42:18] <codecutter> why is the top chart not showing (candles)? https://jsfiddle.net/wfxj6nor/1/ here is the working chart https://jsfiddle.net/wfxj6nor/
[06:45:18] <codecutter> if you have a look at the data format, unless i missed something look pretty much the same correct?
[06:47:47] <codecutter> any suggestions?
[06:57:16] <codecutter> this data works - https://www.highcharts.com/samples/data/jsonp.php?filename=aapl-ohlc.json&callback=?
[06:57:25] <codecutter> this does not https://pastebin.com/55szreCu
[06:58:52] <Hugibeer> Hello everyone. Is anyone aware why JSON data greater than 30 MB would not be passed to a success callback in Internet Explorer 11? Are there any limitations that I am not aware?
[08:22:58] <t532> scroll up
[08:26:06] <t532> why does this chart work https://jsfiddle.net/wfxj6nor/2/
[08:27:04] <t532> but this does not https://jsfiddle.net/wfxj6nor/1/
[08:32:00] <Woet> t532: because that data is in 2008 and the default zoom is 1y.
[08:32:26] <t532> aw
[08:32:34] <t532> are you sure?
[08:32:39] <Woet> .. yes?
[08:32:42] <t532> good man
[08:32:44] <t532> :)
[08:32:50] <Woet> unless you're not referring to the graph being empty as "does not work"
[08:32:53] <t532> makes sense
[08:32:58] <Woet> which, you know, is a rather useless statement
[08:34:02] <t532> actually it should work for all?
[08:34:34] <t532> if there is more then a year's data then it should still work for the 'All'
[08:34:41] <t532> if*
[08:34:43] <Woet> and it does
[08:34:52] <Woet> https://i.imgur.com/GUFnTO9.png
[08:34:59] <Woet> again, stop using the phrases "does not work" and "works"
[08:35:12] <Woet> actually describe what is happening and what you want to happen
[08:35:16] <Woet> for example, a graph being empty does not mean "does not work"
[08:35:19] <t532> it should also work for 1 year also, it would display only current year
[08:35:28] <Woet> and theres no data for that year..
[08:36:06] <t532> by does not work, i mean graph is not shown
[08:36:15] <t532> i should make that clear, sorry
[08:36:41] <t532> have a look at example 1
[08:36:50] <t532> https://jsfiddle.net/wfxj6nor/2/
[08:36:53] <Woet> and i already showed you a screenshot of it working fine
[08:37:06] <Woet> both of them.
[08:37:07] <t532> not there is more then a year's data but this graph is still shown
[08:38:23] <Woet> 1 year: https://i.imgur.com/s4DZzWE.png - all time: https://i.imgur.com/raqN2m7.png
[08:38:34] <Woet> so again, what is the issue?
[08:38:50] <t532> lets start over
[08:39:37] <Woet> and im quite confused how this is a #jquery question too
[08:39:55] <t532> i know
[08:40:23] <t532> i ask because #highcharts is very slow
[08:40:41] <Woet> that doesnt make it on-topic in random different channels
[08:40:58] <Woet> and theres plenty of different options besides IRC: http://www.highcharts.com/support
[08:41:15] <t532> ok nvm
[08:44:32] <shoky> er, he had  yAxis:{ max:140 }  that's why it wasn't showing :p
[08:44:56] <Woet> maybe he should actually describe his issue then
[08:55:25] <z1haze> looking for keyboard opinions, my keyboard preference is to 'loud' for my workplace so I just want to hear of some other popular 'quieter' options that anyone is using
[09:51:28] <MacroMan> How would I go about debugging layout issues while dragging a #sortable element?
[09:51:42] <MacroMan> ie. Can I freeze the dragging to inspect the dom?
[09:55:47] <MacroMan> I've managed to sort my issue by chance, but I'd still like to know if there is a method of doing this.
[10:11:07] <jomofcw> Is their a way to get the full URL called in a XHR, please ? (I'm using jQuery Form plugin that construct the URL in the background using action form attribute and value of the form in GET)
[10:18:28] <FilipNortic_> jomofcw: what does XHR.responseURL give you?
[10:32:39] <Es0teric> if i am finding a class that has a specific data attribute, but jquery finds the class just doesnt output the data from the data-* in the console.. what could be intergereing with that
[10:32:46] <Es0teric> *interfereing
[10:33:51] <FilipNortic_> can you paste the selector you're running
[10:36:02] <Es0teric> FilipNortic_ https://pastebin.com/LkT2ZTcG <-- line 5
[10:41:24] <FilipNortic_> Es0teric: and you're claiming that you're finding the right element but can't see the data attribute?
[10:41:51] <Es0teric> FilipNortic_ yes
[10:45:17] <FilipNortic_> Es0teric: The usall error is that people misunderstand what closest does but if you know you get the right elment then I have no clue
[10:45:40] <Es0teric> closest() goes to the closest li in the dom right?
[10:45:45] <Es0teric> in relative to whats clicked
[10:45:49] <Es0teric> because this is on an on click event
[10:46:54] <FilipNortic_> it goes to either the the element or the closest parrent
[10:48:14] <Es0teric> hmm interesting
[10:48:30] <Es0teric> so FilipNortic_ i think whats happening is that its going to the element and not the parent...
[10:50:14] <FilipNortic_> if it is an li that would happen
[10:52:51] <Es0teric> FilipNortic_ https://jsfiddle.net/o7x6kpd5/7/ this is the structure
[10:54:01] <Es0teric> so basically 'bp_reactions_reactions_list' is what contains the anchors that will be clicked
[10:57:02] <FilipNortic_> Es0teric: do you get the problem you where talking about here
[10:57:10] <Es0teric> FilipNortic_ no
[10:57:21] <Es0teric> i didnt implement that code that i showed you on pastebin there (the js) but the divs are the same
[10:58:12] <FilipNortic_> oh well closest("li") would only take the current element if it was an li so that shouldn't be an issue then
[10:58:28] <Es0teric> FilipNortic_ what do you mean?
[10:58:39] <Es0teric> because closest li would be the li nearest to the <span>
[10:58:40] <Es0teric> right?
[10:59:09] <FilipNortic_> it only travels up
[10:59:22] <Es0teric> right
[10:59:31] <FilipNortic_> so it's the either the element itself or the closest parent
[10:59:34] <Es0teric> so logically if the <span> is clicked, the closest li is the li nearest to the span
[11:00:17] <FilipNortic_> if you define nearest without including child elemnts then that is correct
[11:00:35] <Es0teric> ohhhh i see now
[11:00:54] <Es0teric> so then in this case, it would be the parent
[11:00:59] <Es0teric> so would the parent then be the <ul>
[11:01:00] <FilipNortic_> it's the first parrent that matches the selector if not the element itself matches
[11:01:00] <Es0teric> ?
[11:01:42] <FilipNortic_> yeah but that doesn't match so it continues up until it finds an li or return null
[11:01:52] <Es0teric> ahhh i see now
[11:01:57] <Es0teric> so thats why it can find the .react button
[11:02:14] <Es0teric> ok, that solves that... but the problem is that the data-* attr is not displaying on the console.log
[11:02:24] <Es0teric> so the .react button does contain a data-*
[11:02:32] <Es0teric> for some reason it returns as undefined
[11:02:35] <Es0teric> but its in the dom
[11:02:59] <Es0teric> FilipNortic_
[11:03:06] <FilipNortic_> it might be...your code is large an hard to debug but closest is easy to get wrong so that why i guessed it
[11:03:48] <Es0teric> yeah
[11:12:28] <Es0teric> FilipNortic_ ok what about this... i did a console.log() on $reactButton and it returned this: https://puu.sh/vfGi0/91783cd7cd.png
[11:57:29] <VX> hi, on a click event for '.tabtitle' how can i access the '.moretext' right below it, hiighlighted in read on the image http://pasteboard.co/2EVm6VzW8.png
[11:58:17] <jquery453> If I set a variable to true in an if statement and console log it. Then immediately after set it back to false and console log it, why do my console logs show in a reversed order? (ie: the log of false is showing first)
[12:13:59] <jquery453> If I set a variable to true in an if statement and console log it. Then immediately after set it back to false and console log it, why do my console logs show in a reversed order? (ie: the log of false is showing first)
[12:16:05] <robertmaxrees> jquery453 can you show us what you mean in a jsfiddle?
[12:16:25] <robertmaxrees> because https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/x2a2y4yc/
[12:31:12] <VX> robertmaxrees any thoughts on my issue ?
[12:31:29] <robertmaxrees> i didn't see you post anything...
[12:31:40] <robertmaxrees> i may have shown up after you asked.
[12:33:05] <taplar_> possibly .next('.moretext')
[12:35:43] <VX> taplar_ https://jsfiddle.net/fcb1cosq/
[12:35:54] <VX> trying to open the moretext
[12:36:43] <jquery453> sorry, I left my desk for a second, i'll spin something up
[12:37:25] <VX> tapout give me a sec to update that
[12:38:21] <VX> taplar_ https://jsfiddle.net/fcb1cosq/1/
[12:40:23] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/fcb1cosq/2/
[12:41:30] <taplar_> i might recommend changing your markup so each 'thing' has a unique parent.  then you could base your logic off that parent
[12:41:32] <GeekMonkey> hey
[12:41:50] <GeekMonkey> I am getting this error  Cannot read property 'top' of undefined
[12:42:53] <VX> taplar_ i cant change the markup i have to affect some existing content, i tried nextAll before but didnt reference the first element, ill go with this
[12:44:44] <GeekMonkey> https://codepaste.net/mvccms
[12:44:55] <GeekMonkey> Line 24 is where I get the error
[12:45:01] <GeekMonkey> funny thing is it was working before
[12:45:20] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey what's "id" right there.
[12:45:37] <robertmaxrees> like, what's getting logged in the prior line.
[12:46:16] <GeekMonkey> that is the id in the url of the a tag
[12:46:26] <robertmaxrees> what's the actual ID?
[12:46:26] <GeekMonkey> the console.log shows the ID
[12:46:30] <robertmaxrees> like, the string itself.
[12:46:48] <GeekMonkey> <a href="#aboutus>Go To About Us</a>
[12:47:05] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[12:47:14] <GeekMonkey> why?
[12:47:18] <robertmaxrees> try doing console.log($(id).offset());
[12:48:51] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[12:50:49] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[12:50:57] <GeekMonkey> robertmaxrees it says undefined
[12:51:01] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:51:02] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:51:13] <robertmaxrees> because you're creating an element and then trying to get its offset.
[12:51:19] <robertmaxrees> which can't exist because it's not in the page yet.
[12:51:38] <jquery200> Sorry, computer just went crazy. I have a set up like this: https://jsfiddle.net/ypzcztu8/2/ but I can't recreate my issue so I'm guessing it has to do with something in my whole script
[12:52:07] <robertmaxrees> jquery200 any async operations going on?
[12:52:32] <GeekMonkey> so should I wrap it in a window.load
[12:52:39] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey huh/
[12:52:40] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:52:41] <robertmaxrees> no...
[12:52:58] <robertmaxrees> you're doing $('<a href="#aboutus>Go To About Us</a>')
[12:53:07] <GeekMonkey> no
[12:53:18] <robertmaxrees> so then what's getting spit out by that console log on line 23.
[12:53:19] <GeekMonkey> the element is already on the page
[12:53:23] <robertmaxrees> because you said it's <a href="#aboutus>Go To About Us</a>
[12:53:47] <GeekMonkey> I call the function on click
[12:53:51] <GeekMonkey> look at line 37
[12:53:54] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't matter.
[12:54:06] <robertmaxrees> if line 23 logs out <a href="#aboutus>Go To About Us</a>, then you're creating an element.
[12:54:10] <robertmaxrees> and not selecting anything.
[12:54:25] <GeekMonkey> sorry miscommunicated
[12:55:02] <taplar_> wait, is that markup vertatum?  cause if so you are missing a closing " on your id
[12:55:05] <taplar_> err, href
[12:55:13] <taplar_> verbatum
[12:55:21] <robertmaxrees> *verbatim
[12:55:22] <GeekMonkey> line 23 spits out the ID of the href of the link when I click it ..... so when it was set to console.log(id) it would return :aboutus
[12:55:25] <GeekMonkey> #aboutus
[12:55:25] <jquery200> robertmaxrees I'm consistently updating the locked variable on multiple room objects, so maybe that is it?
[12:55:39] <robertmaxrees> jquery200 i have no idea.  i'd have to see it.
[12:55:55] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey okay. either way, the element doesn't exist when that code fires.
[12:55:56] <jquery200> no worries, I'll keep looking around, thanks for the help!
[12:56:14] <GeekMonkey> but it does exist it is already in the dom
[12:56:36] <robertmaxrees> what happens when you do console.log($(id).length)); ?
[12:57:23] <robertmaxrees> also try console.log('[id="' + id + '"]').length);
[13:01:40] <GeekMonkey> unexpected token )
[13:01:48] <robertmaxrees> for which?
[13:01:55] <Deusdeorum> sigh, i am still having problems with my google maps get long lats: https://jsfiddle.net/udy2hjtq/ so i only want one marker, and i am tring to get the long lats when you use search box as well, but you need to drag the marker for the long lats to change
[13:02:06] <GeekMonkey> the second console log
[13:02:19] <robertmaxrees> what'd you get for the first one GeekMonkey?
[13:02:30] <robertmaxrees> and that second one should be console.log($('[id="' + id + '"]').length);
[13:04:20] <GeekMonkey> 0 and 0
[13:04:28] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:04:30] <GeekMonkey> ya I figured that
[13:04:34] <robertmaxrees> didn't need the second one anyway then.
[13:04:40] <robertmaxrees> so your element doesn't exist at that point.
[13:04:53] <Saint_Isidore> hello, I have a problem I'm trying to solve.. basically I need to change content on click but I'm not sure if I should be showing and hiding with css or update the actual div content?
[13:05:11] <robertmaxrees> Saint_Isidore are you swapping between two states of the thing?
[13:05:56] <Saint_Isidore> I don't think so, but the content does have an <input> that has a value that must be updated as well
[13:06:30] <robertmaxrees> so then what changes?
[13:07:17] <Saint_Isidore> the div content and checkbox input
[13:07:53] <Saint_Isidore> https://getskinprov.com/checkout.php
[13:08:15] <Saint_Isidore> if you click a product option you will see that the little box on the right sidebar updates an offer
[13:08:23] <Saint_Isidore> "Yes, I will take it"
[13:08:49] <robertmaxrees> oh, so you're toggling between thing.s
[13:08:52] <robertmaxrees> show/hide stuff imo.
[13:09:00] <Saint_Isidore> right now I'm hiding and show a completely different div.
[13:09:12] <Saint_Isidore> ok thats what I'm currently doing but I have 1 issue
[13:10:04] <Saint_Isidore> if you click, let's say product option 2, and then click the right side bar check box. the price is updating correctly
[13:10:22] <Saint_Isidore> reads 104.95 in the pricing summary
[13:11:14] <robertmaxrees> >.> okay?
[13:11:23] <Saint_Isidore> but from there, if you click the product option 3, it updates the side bar but the price is still including the previous upsells amount from previously selecting the checkbox
[13:11:52] <GeekMonkey> robertmaxrees thanks.... I found that the colleague building the page wasn't using id= but name=
[13:12:00] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey there you go then!
[13:12:08] <robertmaxrees> Saint_Isidore sounds like you need to re-run the stuff that calculates price then.
[13:12:24] <Saint_Isidore> on clicking a new product (After selecting the checkbox) I need to clear all aside checkboxes and then rerun the cart.updateCart() method
[13:12:39] <robertmaxrees> then do that.
[13:12:45] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have it figured out.
[13:12:56] <Saint_Isidore> ok thats what I was thinking, just not sure how to it exactly
[13:13:04] <robertmaxrees> errr, you just described it.
[13:13:32] <Saint_Isidore> sorry still new and tripping over my code a little bit...but I suppose your right
[13:13:37] <Saint_Isidore> I'll try retackling it
[13:13:52] <robertmaxrees> if you need more help, make a standalone test case to play with.
[13:13:54] <robertmaxrees> instead of the full page.
[13:14:29] <Saint_Isidore> Not sure how I would do that either... since this is tied into some little carting system code
[13:14:47] <robertmaxrees> you don't need the full page for a test case.
[13:14:54] <robertmaxrees> like...
[13:14:55] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[13:15:04] <Saint_Isidore> kk thank you, I'm still learning here :)
[13:18:16] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/38qowwyk/1/
[13:18:33] <robertmaxrees> Saint_Isidore you basically make a super-simple version of your page.
[13:18:57] <Saint_Isidore> without the jquery or js?
[13:19:12] <robertmaxrees> i'm just showing the simplified markup.
[13:19:16] <Saint_Isidore> gotcha
[13:19:17] <robertmaxrees> you'd add the js too.
[13:19:23] <robertmaxrees> just giving you the basic gist.
[13:19:28] <Saint_Isidore> awe ok...got it ;)
[13:19:52] <Saint_Isidore> so its not yoru exact code just a small snippet of code that shoudl accompliosh the simalr functionality?
[13:20:14] <robertmaxrees> sure.  or the real code from the page, just stripped down to the bare essentials.
[13:21:36] <Saint_Isidore> robertmaxrees how can I fire this method kform.updateCart(); using jQuery?
[13:21:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:21:51] <robertmaxrees> clarify?
[13:22:32] <Saint_Isidore> I have an updateCart(); method. I think if I fire it after the input has been unchecked by jQuery it will update my pricing summary properly
[13:23:01] <Saint_Isidore> https://paste.ofcode.org/FDt4rVJUGizeF2svqmHDAH
[13:23:17] <Saint_Isidore> I tried line 19
[13:23:21] <robertmaxrees> just all it manually.
[13:23:24] <robertmaxrees> yeah that should work.
[13:23:30] <Saint_Isidore> but it breaks my code
[13:23:37] <robertmaxrees> "breaks" is vague.
[13:24:46] <Saint_Isidore> your right, 1 sec
[13:25:39] <Woet> you're *
[13:26:04] <Saint_Isidore> yes you're
[13:26:06] <Saint_Isidore> my bad
[13:26:10] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:29:01] <Woet> your bad indeed
[13:29:01] <Woet> ;)
[13:29:09] <robertmaxrees> alright alright
[13:29:34] <Saint_Isidore> :P
[13:31:47] <Saint_Isidore> can I step back a second. When I click the checkbox I do get a console error ()  : Uncaught TypeError: kform.updateCart is not a function
[13:32:04] <Saint_Isidore> but when I click the check box it does indeed run that function and update the cart summary
[13:32:30] <robertmaxrees> "When I click the checkbox I do get a
[13:32:30] <robertmaxrees> console error
[13:32:37] <robertmaxrees> "but when I click the check box it does indeed run that function"
[13:32:40] <robertmaxrees> so it does both?
[13:32:50] <taplar_> sounds like a scope issue with kform
[13:32:52] <Saint_Isidore> yes, this is confusing me
[13:32:55] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:33:08] <robertmaxrees> and you're using .attr() which might be triggering the change event.
[13:33:30] <Saint_Isidore> so its possible to get that error ans still be running the function?
[13:33:57] <robertmaxrees> it means that it's erroring when calling it manually but you've probably bound it to the change event of those checkboxes.
[13:34:01] <robertmaxrees> so it's doing both.
[13:34:05] <robertmaxrees> otherwise it wouldn't run at all.
[13:34:13] <Saint_Isidore> awe...interesting
[13:34:17] <robertmaxrees> *if you didn't bind to the change event i mean
[13:34:42] <Saint_Isidore> I didn't write all this code, so I'm not sure if its "Bound"
[13:35:13] <robertmaxrees> can always use your dev tools to see what handlers are bound to that element.
[13:36:31] <Saint_Isidore> looking
[13:37:06] <robertmaxrees> also: does it run even if you comment out that line calling it directly?
[13:38:18] <Saint_Isidore> robertmaxrees which line would I be commenting out?
[13:40:38] <Saint_Isidore> intersting: if I remove the onclick="kform.updateCart()"  from the input the kform.updateCart() still runs without an error
[13:40:43] <Saint_Isidore> is that what you meant
[13:46:06] <robertmaxrees> hummm
[13:46:08] <robertmaxrees> that's odd.
[13:46:14] <robertmaxrees> something else is probably bound.
[13:49:11] <Saint_Isadore> I think your exactly right... If I inspect the checkbox element in dev tools I can see: https://paste.ofcode.org/gB5iXDhm7vzjHPH6igsShE
[13:49:24] <robertmaxrees> node.addEventListener('click',function(){cart.displayTotals()});
[13:49:27] <robertmaxrees> looks like it.
[13:49:32] <Saint_Isadore> I see that it's "Bindind" right?
[13:49:41] <robertmaxrees> *boun
[13:49:44] <robertmaxrees> **bound
[13:49:58] <robertmaxrees> but looks like it.
[13:51:44] <Saint_Isadore> ok this is a new concept to me... so basically its looking for a checkbox to bind to. If it sees one that is checked, it runs the cart.displayTotals()  correct?
[13:52:03] <robertmaxrees> without seeing more, it's hard to say.
[13:52:27] <robertmaxrees> but this is just binding a handler if it's a checkbox.
[13:54:22] <Saint_Isadore> The handler is the event listener?
[13:54:34] <Saint_Isadore> addEventListener ?
[13:54:43] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:54:46] <Saint_Isadore> kk
[14:16:13] <Saint_Isidore> robertmaxrees I think my issue is I'm only visibly changing the box when you manually uncheck it, I'm not actually firing the event handler.
[14:16:29] <robertmaxrees> i thought you said the code fires when you change it via code...
[14:17:30] <Saint_Isidore> If I manually click the check box it fires, but if I change products (which update the side bar options and input) it's not firing
[14:17:42] <robertmaxrees> then you need to call the update manually.
[14:17:52] <Saint_Isidore> If I click the check box manually...it will
[14:18:13] <robertmaxrees> then call the update code.
[14:18:25] <Saint_Isidore> can I use a trgger() to trick it into firing
[14:18:32] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't.
[14:19:55] <Saint_Isidore> I need the price to re-set if I new product is selected though
[14:20:00] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:20:10] <Saint_Isidore> the old "checked input value" can be included
[14:20:13] <robertmaxrees> so you call the update function itself when they get clicked.
[14:20:40] <Saint_Isidore> but I get that error if I add the update method
[14:21:52] <robertmaxrees> then you need to figure out how to get them in the same scop.
[14:21:56] <robertmaxrees> *scope
[14:22:08] <Saint_Isidore> awe
[14:26:22] <jak2000> hi all
[14:26:24] <jak2000> why:
[14:26:38] <jak2000> var widEtiquetas = $("#xetiquetas").text();
[14:26:39] <jak2000> var wArrEtiquetas = widEtiquetas.split(/\n/);
[14:27:01] <jak2000> split function is not recognized? i am use: jquery-3.1.1.min.js
[14:27:13] <robertmaxrees> split isn't jquery.
[14:27:18] <robertmaxrees> that's js.
[14:27:22] <jak2000> mmm
[14:27:28] <robertmaxrees> what is  widEtiquetas?
[14:27:35] <robertmaxrees> like, the actual value.
[14:29:01] <jak2000> "uncraught  typeError: Cannot read property 'split' of undefined"
[14:29:17] <robertmaxrees> that's not what I asked >.>
[14:29:24] <taplar_> lol
[14:29:42] <jak2000>  var widEtiquetas = $("#xetiquetas").text(); is a text area
[14:29:44] <taplar_> well, he kinda told you, ;)
[14:29:45] <jak2000> i foudn the error
[14:30:00] <jak2000> only have name="xetiquetas"  not id :)
[14:30:16] <Sagar> I want to rotate div on a axis but don't want to keep image inside it straight while rotating
[14:30:36] <jak2000> robertmaxrees thansk
[14:30:38] <jak2000> taplar, thanks
[14:31:29] <jak2000> *thanks
[14:31:37] <robertmaxrees> Sagar so you want to rotate an entire container and its contents?
[14:32:38] <Sagar> robermaxress: yes
[14:32:51] <Sagar> but it is done via the spin animation which is working fine but images inside div are also rotating and facing downside, i want them to keep their facing as it was before rotating.
[14:33:10] <robertmaxrees> so you DON'T want the image to rotate.
[14:33:38] <robertmaxrees> your original statement said that you don't want to keep the image straight, hence the confusion.
[14:33:46] <robertmaxrees> mind making a fiddle and show us what you've tried?
[14:35:01] <Sagar> rovertmaxress: I will try to make a fiddle.
[14:39:03] <Sagar> here is the fiddle robertmaxress: http://jsfiddle.net/nmj61h1q/2/
[14:39:50] <Sagar> robertmaxress: As you can see while rotating on axis, the images are changing their face to downwards, i want to keep them up and in right direction facing upwards.
[14:39:50] <robertmaxrees> aaaah.
[14:40:07] <Sagar> hope u get it? :)
[14:40:11] <robertmaxrees> i'ma point you to ##css
[14:40:15] <robertmaxrees> since this isn't a jquery question.
[14:40:43] <Sagar> no my 1st question is
[14:40:57] <Sagar> i want to achieve that via jquery since the div starts rotating once user on mobile rotates it via TOUCH event
[14:41:04] <Sagar> like a spinning wheel or something
[14:41:12] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[14:41:18] <robertmaxrees> now you're asking 2 question
[14:41:22] <robertmaxrees> *questions
[14:41:28] <Sagar> yes :)
[14:42:10] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nmj61h1q/3/
[14:42:18] <robertmaxrees> just make it a class instead.
[14:43:41] <Sagar> robertmaxress: like a dragable rotatable spin
[14:43:46] <Sagar> with touch fingers?
[14:44:08] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[14:44:17] <robertmaxrees> like you want it to drag with your fingers?
[14:45:35] <Sagar> yes
[14:45:37] <Sagar> exactly
[14:45:41] <robertmaxrees> that's a little more involved.
[14:45:55] <robertmaxrees> i'd search google for touch libraries and look for tutorials tbh.
[14:45:58] <Sagar> like u can conisder each IMAGE as an option for user to select
[14:46:35] <robertmaxrees> right, you want to drag each one along the line.
[14:46:53] <robertmaxrees> which i'm sadly not familiar with the specifics on, but I can suggest you look for touch plugins and read up.
[14:47:11] <Sagar> any links or guides that could help?
[14:48:19] <robertmaxrees> searching javascript touch drag along line in google, the third result was https://greensock.com/forums/topic/8218-drag-along-path-non-rectangular-bounds/
[14:48:25] <robertmaxrees> which has a link to a codepen that could help.
[14:59:43] <Sagar> robertmaxrees: is it done via TweenMax draggable?
[15:00:29] <Sagar> robertmaxress: also that's dragable, i want to achieve rotatable
[15:46:55] <fission6> anyone have a good snippet for ordering items, i have a 6 - 10 divs i show to users, i want to let them uses up and down arrows to dictate the order of the divs client side
[15:50:51] <robertmaxrees> there's .before() and .insertBefore()
[15:58:32] <Saint_Isidore> got it all working now robertmaxrees Thank you for your help!
[16:00:06] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[16:00:46] <Saint_Isidore> yes I found the correct method to call within the correct scope..just as you suggested
[16:00:52] <Saint_Isidore> rad indeed! :)
[16:09:16] <stef> hello
[16:11:02] <robertmaxrees> hullo
[16:11:19] <stef> may I ask a question related to .animate() ?
[16:11:25] <robertmaxrees> you just did ;)
[16:11:30] <stef> :D
[16:11:38] <robertmaxrees> just ask your question - if somebody can help, they will.
[16:11:48] <stef> I've a syntax problem with -webkit
[16:11:59] <stef> $( "#block" ).animate({
[16:12:08] <stef>   filter: 'blur(10px)'
[16:12:19] <stef>   -webkit-filter: 'blur(10px)'
[16:12:44] <robertmaxrees> err, why not use CSS for this?
[16:12:48] <stef> the webkit rule says "Unexpected Token :"
[16:13:32] <stef> hmm good question
[16:13:38] <robertmaxrees> just add/remove a class.
[16:13:41] <robertmaxrees> problem solved.
[16:15:27] <stef> thanks a lot :)
[16:45:30] <VX> how can i hide the .readmore related to the https://jsfiddle.net/fcb1cosq/3/ .tabtitle clicked
[16:46:47] <robertmaxrees> can you modify the markup?
[16:47:36] <VX> no
[16:47:39] <robertmaxrees> D:
[16:47:41] <robertmaxrees> yeesh.
[16:47:55] <robertmaxrees> that's gonna be a pain.
[16:48:12] <VX> yeah
[16:48:34] <robertmaxrees> why can't you change the markup?
[16:50:25] <VX> i have to put js in the content to affect whats already output, its on a acoordian and we dont have access to the code
[16:50:36] <robertmaxrees> that's really limiting.
[16:50:40] <VX> it is
[16:51:34] <robertmaxrees> what accordion are you using?
[16:54:04] <VX> looks like some custom code
[16:54:34] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:54:36] <robertmaxrees> soooo
[16:56:08] <VX> got it, https://jsfiddle.net/fcb1cosq/4/
[16:56:19] <robertmaxrees> that's really fragile.
[16:56:20] <robertmaxrees> but OK.
[16:56:25] <VX> not the best solution but given what im working with, im gonna go with it
[16:56:33] <robertmaxrees> i'd just correct the markup.
[16:56:44] <robertmaxrees> a minimal change would save you big headaches later.
