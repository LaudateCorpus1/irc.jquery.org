[13:41:22] <paule32> robertmaxrees: hello
[13:41:33] <paule32> robertmaxrees: can you find the mistake: http://dpaste.com/0RH3TJK  ?
[13:41:41] <robertmaxrees> ask the channel, not a specific person ;)
[13:41:52] <paule32> hello channel
[13:42:00] <paule32> channel: can you find the mistake: http://dpaste.com/0RH3TJK  ?
[13:42:23] <robertmaxrees> also: linking 169 lines of code and asking a vague and generic "can you find the mistake" is a great way to not get help.
[13:42:35] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue you're having?
[13:42:40] <paule32> the problem is, all icons, that dbl click will open window
[13:42:51] <robertmaxrees> ok?
[13:42:55] <paule32> else the content window
[13:42:59] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting to happen instead?
[13:43:17] <paule32> that the part of app1.php is filled with tmp
[13:43:31] <paule32> line 21
[13:43:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?>
[13:44:02] <robertmaxrees> start over - "I'm trying to make x happen, but y happens instead."
[13:44:14] <paule32> is content == "" window will open
[13:45:11] <robertmaxrees> you're assuming we know much more than we do about your project.  what are you expecting to happen?  what's happening instead?
[13:46:35] <paule32> i expect, that the file content of file app1.php is append to "content" (line 21) but i get the output around the "desktop"
[13:47:16] <paule32> the same problem, i had yesterday, that was solving with your $.parser.parse("#id");
[13:47:18] <robertmaxrees> so the code being fetched via that .load() isn't appending to the correct place?
[13:47:26] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[13:47:36] <robertmaxrees> did you even read the docs on that method?
[13:47:50] <paule32> yes, it work
[13:48:02] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue here then?
[13:48:55] <robertmaxrees> since you've elected to not make a fiddle, it's very diofficult to understand what is/isn't going on here.
[13:49:07] <paule32> but something magic goes on with the .load content, i can see it in alert message box, but when i append the content data to the tmp variable the window will not show, instead, the content data is shown
[13:49:48] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean "the content data is shown"?
[13:50:17] <paule32> the components of easyui-panel + html stuff
[13:50:25] <robertmaxrees> as opposed to...
[13:50:40] <paule32> the content data is at line 75
[13:50:40] <robertmaxrees> just setup a fiddle.
[13:50:49] <robertmaxrees> otherwise I have NO idea what you're talking about.
[13:51:02] <robertmaxrees> you can reduce this down to a really simple test case.
[13:52:30] <robertmaxrees> also: what's the story with tmp = xhr.responseText; ??  why not just use the response?
[13:52:41] <robertmaxrees> so just do openWindow(150,150,500,500,_title,_class,response);
[13:54:23] <paule32> it the same issue
[14:00:38] <robertmaxrees> then i have no idea how to help.
[14:06:55] <paule32> https://jsfiddle.net/vb8atw73/11/
[14:07:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:07:19] <robertmaxrees> so how do i replicate the bug?
[14:07:32] <robertmaxrees> also: that ajax call is getting blocked.
[14:07:36] <paule32> double click on the picture
[14:07:48] <paule32> why?
[14:07:50] <robertmaxrees> your server isn't setup for CORS.
[14:08:00] <robertmaxrees> and you're calling to HTTP from an HTTPS page.
[14:08:03] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[14:08:07] <robertmaxrees> you don't even need the js.
[14:08:09] <robertmaxrees> *ajax
[14:09:04] <robertmaxrees> also trying to hit www.kallup.solutions/app1.php is taking forever.  can you just copy the rendered source for that page?
[14:11:29] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4me7wkq8/3/
[14:11:54] <paule32> http://i.imgur.com/jvmeELA.png
[14:11:56] <robertmaxrees> you're overthinking the test case.  just ditch the ajax call and put some sample market in that response=
[14:12:09] <robertmaxrees> ??
[14:13:27] <robertmaxrees> how does a screenshot help me?
[14:13:52] <paule32> you would a page
[14:14:07] <robertmaxrees> that... isn't a complete sentence.
[14:14:13] <robertmaxrees> look at my last fiddle.
[14:14:18] <robertmaxrees> i just need some sample HTML there.
[14:14:32] <paule32> ok moment
[14:20:36] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[14:21:31] <robertmaxrees> paule32 you OK there?
[14:22:05] <paule32> https://www.kallup.solutions/windows/start.php?sid=1#
[14:22:47] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/Bc1HnNL.png
[14:23:07] <robertmaxrees> just right click -> view source -> copy/paste into a paste service.
[14:23:25] <paule32> it is a self sign cert
[14:23:32] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to accept it.
[14:23:42] <robertmaxrees> especially not on my work machine.
[14:23:49] <robertmaxrees> just copy/paste the page source.
[14:26:39] <paule32> that not showing the total code
[14:27:01] <robertmaxrees> uh
[14:27:02] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:27:14] <robertmaxrees> that's all the ajax call is going to get.
[14:27:24] <robertmaxrees> is whatever you see in the "view source".

[14:30:28] <paule32> http://i.imgur.com/vBq940N.png
[14:30:36] <robertmaxrees> if you link one more screenshot i'm kicking you lol
[14:30:44] <robertmaxrees> this is getting absurd.
[14:32:25] <paule32> http://dpaste.com/0SE8PS8
[14:32:29] <paule32> that is all
[14:32:33] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[14:32:41] <paule32> i can package the project
[14:32:44] <robertmaxrees> so first off: appending all of this into another page isn't going to work.
[14:33:09] <robertmaxrees> you need to serve up just the body of the page.
[14:33:36] <robertmaxrees> second, you need to make sure you're actually serving up the raw HTML you need.
[14:33:51] <robertmaxrees> so no client-side rendering or anything like that on the page youre calling to.
[14:37:38] <paule32> here the unmodified raw html:  http://dpaste.com/1QEQ2ZY
[14:37:43] <paule32> body
[14:37:56] <robertmaxrees> is that all that comes from the server when you call that endpoint?
[14:38:13] <paule32> yes
[14:38:44] <robertmaxrees> okay.,
[14:39:20] <robertmaxrees> so pop that into the fiddle I updated :)
[14:40:21] <robertmaxrees> literally just needed to do this:     <!-- screen -->
[14:40:21] <robertmaxrees>     <div class="panel panel-htop" style="display: block;"><div id="container" class="easyui-panel panel-body panel-body-noheader" title="" style="width: 1435px;">
[14:40:21] <robertmaxrees>                         <!-- logon section -->
[14:40:21] <robertmaxrees>                 <div id="winlogon" class="picture" style="display: none;">
[14:40:21] <robertmaxrees>                     <div="winauth" style="left:80px;top:240px;position:absolute;">
[14:40:53] <robertmaxrees> LMAO shame shame shame on me.
[14:41:13] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4me7wkq8/9/ - here's what i meant to paste.
[14:44:10] <robertmaxrees> also: you need to kill out any JS in there.
[14:44:36] <robertmaxrees> <div="winauth" isn'
[14:44:40] <robertmaxrees> *isn't valid markup.
[14:45:13] <robertmaxrees> anyway, i gotta head out for a bit.  glhf.
[16:35:21] <paule32> hui
[16:35:25] <paule32> what a mess
[16:35:26] <paule32> http://dpaste.com/2A8H7ZE
[16:35:43] <paule32> the ajax request is my friend and solve my problem
[16:36:06] <paule32> something is magic with .load on jquery
[16:53:39] <Es0teric> is it possible to do an event.preventDefault() on a .trigger() ?
[16:53:51] <taplar> ?
[16:54:33] <Es0teric> taplar like.. using .trigger() to trigger a event.preventDefault()
[16:54:48] <taplar> no, trigger is used to create an event
[16:55:04] <taplar> you can preventDefault on the event created in the handler
[16:57:06] <Es0teric> right so i can do a custom trigger then do event.preventDefault() inside of the callback right?
[16:57:13] <taplar> yep
[16:57:25] <Es0teric> thats what i thought... i just wanted to make sure i got the right concept
[17:04:02] <Es0teric> taplar also, when using .on('change', function() { }); does it have to trigger the change first before deciding to use the callback code?
[17:04:05] <Es0teric> or will it not matter?
[17:04:36] <taplar> the event listener has to have been bound before the evnet happens
[17:05:22] <Es0teric> becuase i dont know if i want to attach an on change to a checkbox within a on click
[17:06:02] <taplar> typically you do not want to create event listeners in event handlers
[17:06:25] <taplar> you'll ususally end up with duplicate event bindings doing that
[17:07:12] <Es0teric> hmm
[17:07:17] <Es0teric> then how should i proceed with this
[17:07:34] <taplar> what's the issue you're trying to resolve?
[17:08:32] <Es0teric> i have a checkbox that i need to check if its check against to shoot off an ajax request after a click event
[17:09:24] <taplar> that sounds like you just need a click event handler.  what other event handler are you thinking you need?
[17:09:46] <Es0teric> on change to check against the checkbox being changed
[17:10:37] <taplar> hold on a second though.  you said "after a click event".  what element is being clicked that you then need to check the state of the checkbox?
[17:10:50] <Es0teric> a wordpress publish button on the admin backend
[17:11:19] <taplar> ok, so you'd have a click event listener on that button that would then check the state of the checkbox
[17:11:38] <taplar> or do you want them to be able to click the button, and if they they check the checkbox, fire an ajax request?
[17:11:51] <taplar> "they they" => "they then"
[17:11:59] <Es0teric> no
[17:19:53] <Es0teric> nvm taplar  i got it
[18:19:10] <paule32> hello
[18:19:28] <paule32> i have load an external html file per ajax
[18:20:07] <paule32> this file contains <script> directive, but i am thinking, that his script is not loaded/execute
[18:20:19] <paule32> can this be true?
[18:20:27] <taplar> .load() will perform a global eval for any scripts included in it
[18:21:22] <taplar> even if it didn't do a global eval, the script would be processed when the html was added to the dom
[18:23:41] <taplar> https://j11y.io/jquery/#v=2.1.3&fn=jQuery.parseHTML
[18:23:56] <taplar> The line that says `jQuery(scripts).remove()` is the part that does the eval
[18:46:38] * taplar stares at the clock
[18:47:14] <robertmaxrees> extremely same
[21:54:46] <Tcalp> Hey guys, anyone know of a good plugin for making a form listbox quickly re-sortable (manual adjustment up/down of items in the list)
