[00:07:14] <t0nttu> can anyone tell me if this is impossible to do with jQuery http://forum.jquery.com/topic/loop-animated-change-of-border-image
[00:31:25] <coldhead> PLEASE WAIT WHILE MY ORDER IS BEING PROCESSED
[00:33:48] <badlands> what is the best way to purge a number such as 2.3456 of all of it's decimal places. leaving only the 2, without rounding in javascript?
[00:39:00] <iszak> badlands, regex?
[00:39:23] <iszak> substr even
[00:39:30] <iszak> if it's a string
[00:41:39] <coldhead> var x = '2.24248242984'; Math.floor(x);
[00:41:55] <coldhead> ?eval  var x = '2.24248242984'; Math.floor(x);
[00:41:57] <bot-t> coldhead: 2
[00:43:15] <coldhead> ?eval  var x = 2.99999248242984; Math.floor(x);
[00:43:16] <bot-t> coldhead: 2
[00:43:20] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[00:43:20] * bot-t sighs
[00:43:26] <coldhead> you mah nigga
[00:44:39] <sdio> coldhead: I thought I was your nigga? :(
[00:44:44] <sdio> losing all my friends today
[00:44:47] <sdio> not cool, bro.
[00:45:08] <coldhead> i have 2 niggas
[00:45:10] <coldhead> it's cool bro
[00:45:19] <coldhead> did i just sound like an early US president?
[00:45:22] <coldhead> sorry about that
[00:45:34] <iszak> coldhead, I figured he didn't want that either.
[00:45:44] <coldhead> who knows what he wants
[00:45:48] <iszak> coldhead, you can't be a US president, you're not born in USA.
[00:45:51] <coldhead> HE'S A MYSTERY
[00:46:46] <sdio> WRAPPED IN AN ENIGMA
[00:49:01] <iszak> sigh, I just got called to help someone to find out why their desktop icon had dotted borders after they selected it -__-
[00:49:31] <sdio> did you tell them not to move their mouse at all?
[00:49:35] <sdio> clearly they have a virus
[00:49:39] <iszak> clearly.
[00:49:43] <sdio> and if they move their mouse, it'll spread to the printer port.
[00:49:49] <iszak> speaking of virus and dodgy shit
[00:49:56] <iszak> yoytube.com comes up with a fake site that looks like youtube
[00:50:15] <sdio> well, free world.
[00:50:30] <sdio> napstar.com used to point to blacks on blondes.
[00:50:36] <sdio> back in napster's heydey.
[00:50:39] <sdio> it was quite awesome.
[00:50:42] <iszak> atleast that's of some use.
[00:50:58] <sdio> clearly. keeping those blacks occupied will ensure they're not out stealing my tv.
[00:51:12] <coldhead> might have crossed a line a bit there, sdio
[00:51:17] <sdio> I am on a troll-roll.
[00:51:29] <coldhead> yeah but there's trolling and then there's the lolocaust
[00:51:39] <iszak> then there's racist
[00:51:47] <coldhead> auschwitz was a gas, ann frankly i won't stand for it, etc
[00:51:54] <sdio> *anne, actually.
[00:52:02] <sdio> get the joke right..
[00:52:16] <coldhead> thx
[00:52:29] <sdio> I'm doing my best not to exploit the wide open "lolocaust".
[00:52:52] <coldhead> i applaud your restraint
[00:53:09] <sdio> If the channel remains dead, I might haveto let go.
[00:54:16] <zpoley> what's going on here?
[00:54:40] <sdio> pure awesomeness?
[00:54:48] <zpoley> haha
[00:54:49] <zpoley> nice
[00:55:24] <zpoley> just what i was looking for
[00:56:03] <t0nttu> some funky negro jiveQuery going on
[00:56:24] <sdio> I might have set something free, ladies and gents.
[00:57:51] <coldhead> don't make me summon the law
[00:58:12] <sdio> really..
[00:58:13] <sdio> hard..
[00:58:19] <sdio> must.. resist.
[00:58:22] <zpoley> i think the law is asleep
[00:58:37] <coldhead> i have the law on speeddial
[00:59:00] <sdio> fuck, coldhead.
[00:59:04] <sdio> you're making it really hard for me.
[00:59:26] <zpoley> me too
[00:59:34] <coldhead> THAT IS WHAT SHE SAID
[00:59:39] <coldhead> or he said
[00:59:46] <coldhead> fuck, how does it work again?
[01:00:07] <coldhead> INSERT THE TAB MARKED C INTO THE SLOT MARKED D
[01:00:11] <sdio> I got no idea, I was too busy raping.
[01:00:41] <sdio> third fucking pair of calfskin gloves I've been through this month. Bitches need to calm the hell down.
[01:00:48] <sdio> that shit ain't cheap, yo.
[01:01:21] <coldhead> >_>
[01:01:46] <sdio> That's what she tried to do.
[01:01:50] <t0nttu> I want to rape css border-image property w/ jQuery, can you help me sdio?
[01:02:23] <sdio> no, I'm currently on a "I know nothing but VBScript" kick.
[01:02:25] <sdio> So, vbscript?
[01:02:58] <zpoley> so you're just rapping the jquery with vbscript?
[01:03:17] <sdio> I'm fairly certain whatever you do with vbscript is classified a crime against humanity, anyway.
[01:04:13] <zpoley> t0nttu: if you want to do what i think you want to do with the border, you should just put one div inside another with a little padding on the inner one, absolutely positioned and have the back div be your image transition
[01:04:33] <zpoley> t0nttu: are you trying to make it shimmer or something?
[01:04:48] <t0nttu> zpoley: yes fade in and out
[01:05:09] <zpoley> yeah - do you get what i mean? would that work?
[01:05:30] <t0nttu> zpoley: yes :)
[01:05:38] <zpoley> nice :) good luck
[01:06:17] <zpoley> t0nttu: send me a link if you get it working
[01:06:21] <t0nttu> I was just interested in knowing if actual manipulation of the property is somehow extremely difficult
[01:06:45] <zpoley> oh - the border image property?
[01:06:53] <t0nttu> zpoley: yeah
[01:07:32] <zpoley> t0nttu: yeah i don't think you could do what you want with the border image property unless you made the image a gif, but that's just a guess
[01:09:19] <t0nttu> A nice way to make border-images is to take an existing seamless pattern (in vector format preferably) with elements that you can quickly delete to make it suit the requirements. And then use this great app http://border-image.com/
[01:09:50] <zpoley> wow that's ugly
[01:09:58] <zpoley> i hope you make it look better than that
[01:10:16] <t0nttu> well that's the W3C example image
[01:10:44] <zpoley> ok
[01:11:17] <t0nttu> I can show you a beautiful floral pattern I edited together.. I'll upload it somewhere
[01:11:21] <zpoley> what are you trying to get it to look like?
[01:11:22] <zpoley> yeah
[01:11:33] <coldhead> BOT-T NOOO
[01:12:33] <t0nttu> http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/8226/floralpatv3mergedsini.png
[01:12:52] <zpoley> that looks much better
[01:13:10] <zpoley> and how are you trying to transition it?
[01:13:29] <t0nttu> well just to a different color version
[01:14:25] <t0nttu> just think it would maybe look cool to have it very slowly fade in and out, not a big color difference, maybe a subtle change in lightness
[01:14:57] <zpoley> that's cool - what have you tried so far?
[01:16:17] <t0nttu> I looked around for existing solutions for infinite looping fades, but I've not put much effort in implementing this, concentrated on other things. I'm not very knowledgeable in jQuery or JS
[01:17:16] <zpoley> do you need it to be variably sized? because that would mess up your pattern right
[01:18:06] <t0nttu> no it's just repeating
[01:18:44] <zpoley> what do you want to put in the middle of it?
[01:19:18] <sdio> Why not just make it outlines only, transparent, set the bg, transition?
[01:19:37] <sdio> Not the nicest, design wise, but, code wise, it is.
[01:19:48] <t0nttu> it was somewhat tedious to get it align up in the graphics editor and later with CSS. But I'm OK with a non-animating image, it's a very nice pattern. In the middle of it I put text and actually I put a gradient border which turns into a solid color so I have a gradient-floral-edge article box
[01:20:22] <zpoley> that sounds very elaborate
[01:20:26] <zpoley> can i see your site?
[01:21:26] <zpoley> did you make that pattern btw?
[01:21:32] <t0nttu> zpoley: http://natha.fi/ecotrance/ecotrance-menneet.php it's not released yet and I am going to change the lighter blue text background
[01:21:47] <t0nttu> zpoley: I edited an existing free vector pattern
[01:22:09] <zpoley> woooo!!!
[01:22:11] <zpoley> that's nice!
[01:22:18] <t0nttu> zpoley: text background.. I mean image gallery bg of course in this case :)
[01:22:27] <zpoley> great work t0nttu
[01:23:04] <t0nttu> zpoley: hey thanks man :) I'm glad to hear you like it, considering I want to make some improvements
[01:23:43] <zpoley> i'm surprised i can't see any seams
[01:24:33] <t0nttu> zpoley: yep I'm suprised too :D took a lot of fiddling
[01:27:01] <t0nttu> here's another crazy request/wish I made recently, Poisson random distribution of elements on page: https://github.com/coryschires/splatter/issues/2
[01:27:15] <zpoley> t0nttu: i wish i had a better suggestion, but i would just say you should leave it, maybe just fade that shadow in between
[01:27:45] <zpoley> haha
[01:28:56] <zpoley> you should implement it yourself and then send a pull request
[01:31:19] <t0nttu> right :) with my amazing math and programming skills
[01:31:36] <t0nttu> I'll stick to floral arrangements
[01:31:46] <zpoley> well, if you're smart enough to suggest it, i think you could implement it :)
[01:33:09] <zpoley> also, for that border image, have you looked at all of these things: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/css/css_transitions
[01:33:11] <sdio> get a room.
[01:33:24] <zpoley> this is a room
[01:34:01] <zpoley> sdio: what happened to the troll-roll?
[01:34:16] <sdio> I got bored.
[01:34:23] <zpoley> ha
[01:34:36] <sdio> I was attempting to convince someone that you could run vbscript in ring0.
[01:34:43] <sdio> He stopped responding.
[01:34:48] <sdio> longtroll failed :(
[01:34:48] <zpoley> hahaha
[01:34:50] <zpoley> awesome
[01:35:03] <sdio> systemfault didn't back me up.
[01:35:05] <zpoley> where was that happening?
[01:35:11] <sdio> #oftn
[01:35:25] <sdio> I called out to him 4 times!
[01:35:31] <t0nttu> zpoley: no I have to check transitions out sometime. It's nice that with CSS3PIE I can make the gradient border-image work in IE - only stretch is supported, not repeat http://css3pie.com/
[01:35:33] <sdio> He just refused to back me up.
[01:35:36] <zpoley> hahaha
[01:36:38] <zpoley> oh man
[01:36:42] <zpoley> awesome
[01:42:46] <gugahoi> How do I go about getting all the input tags within a div? Is that possible to do with $.each
[01:43:13] <sdio> zpoley: say VBScript
[01:45:21] <sdio> zpoley: tiny amount of inline ASM.
[01:45:35] <sdio> zpoley: under 100 lines.
[01:46:35] <zpoley> sdio: line
[01:47:14] <sdio> zpoley: well, it does, because the spec is really simple due to the intel/ms connection
[01:47:21] <sdio> zpoley: just tell him to read some random spec.
[01:47:50] <sdio> x86-64 spec from Intel released in 2001
[01:47:55] <sdio> throw in a random section/subsection
[01:48:16] <sdio> and some random authors, thus far he still hasn't figured out that VBScript doesn't have a public spec..
[01:49:43] <sdio> excellent
[01:49:47] <zpoley> sdio: oh man this is killin me, it's hilarious
[01:50:01] <zpoley> the long-long-troll, so well executed
[01:50:05] <sdio> :)
[01:50:40] <sdio> hopefully we'll get him fully convinced and then leave him in that state, for him to poison the minds of others!
[01:50:49] <sdio> contagious troll is best troll.
[01:50:50] <zpoley> hahha
[01:52:19] <zpoley> hahaha
[01:52:41] <zpoley> wha!?!?
[01:52:58] <sdio> someone obviously told :(.
[01:53:05] <zpoley> no wy
[01:58:41] <sdio> zpoley: "TR Group 293"
[01:58:49] <sdio> zpoley: say you have to run, and leave!
[01:59:00] <sdio> great chat, etc
[01:59:04] <sdio> i'll handle the website ;)
[01:59:14] <coldhead> big bang theory actually namedrops ubuntu <3
[01:59:50] <sdio> good.
[02:00:36] <sdio> fuck, this could get even better!
[02:00:49] <zpoley> hahaha
[02:03:55] <H4nSolo> good morning everybody
[02:04:18] <H4nSolo> german support to?
[02:04:26] <sdio> jah, jah.
[02:04:45] <zpoley> i couldn't keep it up, i'm sorry, i ruined it
[02:04:51] <coldhead> #jQuery-de
[02:04:52] <sdio> :(
[02:04:54] <zpoley> that was great though, you are quite the master sdio
[02:05:06] <sdio> I was going to have him make us a website.
[02:05:14] <coldhead> bot-t: tell h4nsolo #jQuery-de
[02:05:14] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[02:05:20] <zpoley> oh man, i would feel too bad about that
[02:05:26] <sdio> I wouldn't.
[02:05:34] <zpoley> haha
[02:05:48] <sdio> If he's that gullible, he's going to be taken advantage of at some point
[02:05:54] <sdio> might as well learn his lesson with something harmless.
[02:06:04] <heatxsink---> anyone in here use irccloud?
[02:06:07] <zpoley> oh man, i was seriously cracking up, i can't believe how great that was
[02:06:38] <sdio> yes, 89% of people believe all statistics they hear.
[02:06:46] <zpoley> ha
[02:06:49] <sdio> and 95% of them will believe you if you cite a random paper.
[02:06:55] <sdio> Which may or may not exist.
[02:07:10] <H4nSolo> sry connection lost -.-
[02:07:11] <bot-t> (1 min 56 secs ago) <coldhead> tell h4nsolo #jQuery-de
[02:07:13] <zpoley> ha
[02:07:15] <H4nSolo> ahh thx
[02:07:47] <sdio> back to troll rolling
[02:08:23] <zpoley> sdio: how did you decide to troll in that room?
[02:08:46] <sdio> zpoley: he invited me in there after seeing me talk about ASM in ##programming.
[02:08:58] <sdio> told me I'd be a great addition to their team of open source hackers.
[02:09:13] <zpoley> sdio: wow
[02:09:26] <zpoley> sdio: that's awesome
[02:09:37] <sdio> at which point, the obvious path was to do the long troll!
[02:10:09] <zpoley> hahaha
[02:10:33] <sdio> the beatings will continue until morale improves!
[02:10:47] <sdio> he still wants to make a website.
[02:10:50] <sdio> it's like running over kittens.
[02:10:58] <sdio> either he's long trolling me now, or he's an utter idiot.
[02:11:00] <sdio> hard to tell!
[02:11:06] <zpoley> hahha
[02:11:16] <zpoley> longtroll is longtrolled
[02:11:29] <huglester> guys, I have smth like this: $('.location_form_box .country').live('click', function(e); // But now I need to launch this 'click' event from another function, how do I do that?
[02:11:30] <sdio> "<x> You want it dark/gothic.. what do you like about the geocites pages?"
[02:11:41] <zpoley> or, longtrolled is longtroller
[02:11:41] <sdio> I told him I want it in the geocities style.
[02:11:59] <zpoley> yeah, it needs to look good in IE6-
[02:12:15] <zpoley> particularly IE4.4 because that's what all my VMs are running
[02:12:23] <sdio> either way, getting boring.
[02:13:11] <H4nSolo> i'm try to use a jquery slider but i would it to slide from the DIV bottom to the top.
[02:13:11] <H4nSolo> sorry but my englisch is not so good. ;)
[02:14:12] <zpoley> sdio: well it  was a good one, nice work
[02:14:46] <sdio> thank you, fellow troller.
[02:14:59] <sdio> I think I've got about a month's worth of trolling out of my system.
[02:15:04] <sdio> Good stuff :).
[02:15:10] <psych0-b> whats trolling?
[02:15:17] <jgmcelwain> Hey Guys, any chance I can have some help with jQuery.getJSON() ?
[02:15:51] <sdio> psych0-b: When you're really nice to people.
[02:16:19] <sdio> psych0-b: Around once a month, I try to be very nice, honest and helpful to everyone, about everything.
[02:16:50] <SuperRoach> Evening all :) had a ball revamping a niche product with jq/jqui. I'm happy with it functionally, although I think I overloaded the .tabs() implementation haha. - http://brettjames.au.com/sandbox/scoreboard.html
[02:16:56] <sdio> This period is called "to- rolling"
[02:16:59] <psych0-b> sdio: hahaha http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=trolling
[02:17:01] <sdio> or trollingfor short.
[02:17:06] <sdio> fuck.
[02:17:12] <jgmcelwain> when I run '$.getJSON("http://forrst.com/api/v2/stats");', I get the error "XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://forrst.com/api/v2/stats. Origin http://jsfiddle.net is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin."
[02:17:21] <jgmcelwain> any ideas?
[02:17:49] <sdio> jgmcelwain: same origin policy..
[02:18:16] <jgmcelwain> sdio: erm, can you elaborate? this is my first time using jQuery. :)
[02:18:48] <gnarf> ?sop @jgmcelwain
[02:18:49] <bot-t> jgmcelwain, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[02:19:56] <jgmcelwain> Ok. Is there any way around it?
[02:20:23] <sdio> crap.
[02:20:32] <sdio> He finally caught on.
[02:20:34] <sdio> fucking systemfault.
[02:21:03] <sdio> I am now officially banned from #oftn. Apparently he wasn't longtrolling me back, and he actually believed all that.
[02:21:08] <sdio> And is now officially butthurt.
[02:21:11] <sdio> ah well
[02:21:55] <zpoley> that's too bad, i thought he had you
[02:22:24] <sdio> one would think noone was that stupid.
[02:22:36] <sdio> one would be wrong.
[02:23:40] <gnarf> sdio: can we stay a little more on topic than chatting about trolling people in another channel? :)
[02:24:06] <sdio> gnarf: sure, all out of my system now.
[02:24:31] <sdio> gnarf: if you'd prefer, next time I'll troll people in #jquery exclusively..
[02:24:45] <Woet> $("#sdio").remove();
[02:25:07] <sdio> :(
[02:25:29] <t0nttu> evilness is not cool
[02:25:57] <sdio> trolling != evil.
[02:27:23] <t0nttu> maybe the butthurt one doesn't know that
[02:27:32] <gnarf> psst
[02:27:42] <sdio> tough shit. the world isn't all kittens and roses, get over it.
[02:28:55] <sdio> If you're gullible enough to believe you can create an OS in VBScript, and Xen has been ported to VBScript, you're going to get screwed.
[02:29:04] <sdio> Now, jquery and all that?
[02:30:34] <SuperRoach> hmm
[02:31:54] <coldhead> sdio: you really don't troll with much class. take it to #trolling if you want to learn the craft
[02:32:05] <sdio> coldhead: :(
[02:32:31] <gnarf> coldhead: seems your here to troll now, I'm going to bed ;)
[02:32:43] <sdio> I refuse to join #trolling on the off-chance I'm being trolled :(
[02:32:47] <gnarf> night everyone
[02:32:48] <sdio> I don't trust you coldhead
[02:32:52] <sdio> how does that make you feel?!
[02:32:59] <sdio> HMN?
[02:33:07] <sdio> I hope you feel very bad about yourself!
[02:33:15] <sdio> VERY BAD INDEED.

[02:34:27] <coldhead> i'm down for trolling, but endless discussion masturbatory of trolling is... a bit of a wank
[02:35:14] <sdio> coldhead: That seems like a bit of a circlejerk..
[02:35:46] <coldhead> mooooooving right along
[02:35:58] <sdio> with the circlejerking?
[02:44:46] <walid> hi all!
[02:45:01] <walid> i'm struggling with the quicksand plugin, that I would like to implement on my site
[02:45:11] <walid> here is what I try to do: http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/W2YqZ/
[02:45:20] <walid> and here is the base example: http://razorjack.net/quicksand/demos/one-set-clone.html
[02:45:56] <walid> anyone familiar with that, or willing to take a look? i spent some 5 hours on it last night, without success :(
[02:49:34] <coldhead> i'll take a look in 11 minutes if no one gets to it before then, walid
[02:49:48] <walid> coldhead: that would be awesome
[02:50:03] <walid> thanks a lot, i really can't get it to work for me.. ;(
[02:50:24] <walid> I'll try and theme it a little for better visualizing
[02:58:34] <Noor_egy> hello
[03:01:42] <coldhead> hi Noor_egy
[03:03:15] <erry> Hi
[03:03:17] <erry> Um
[03:03:21] <erry> i slideDown(1000) orn something
[03:03:26] <erry> but it immediately slides down
[03:03:34] <erry> there's no 1000 second delay
[03:03:35] <erry> err
[03:03:38] <erry> 1 second*
[03:03:47] <erry> slideUp (1000) works
[03:04:29] <erry> Also
[03:04:40] <erry> can i use $ to getElementsByClassName
[03:04:43] <erry> or do i have to use id
[03:04:53] <coldhead> walid: this is more gomblex than i expected, lemme get back to this
[03:04:56] <Woet> erry: $(".class")
[03:04:59] <GoddeR> $(".className")
[03:05:15] <erry>  so like $(".class")[0]?
[03:05:27] <GoddeR> .slideDown( [ duration ], [ easing ], [ callback ] )
[03:05:40] <Noor_egy> im using plugin to validate my forms and another plugin to send ajax requests to my server now when I try to mix them the syntax be like this http://jsfiddle.net/fd9yr/1/ but the propleme that the form is generated in the fly I mean that you need to use ('#formname').live()
[03:05:41] <Woet> erry: for the first one, yes
[03:05:47] <walid> coldhead: it's not that easy, heh? ;)
[03:06:17] <erry> var oddbox = $(".oddbox")[0]; console.log (oddbox);
[03:06:18] <erry> Undefined :SD
[03:06:21] <erry> *:S
[03:06:36] <Noor_egy> anyone know how could I do that
[03:06:38] <Noor_egy> ?
[03:07:15] <erry> Ok now i have another problem
[03:07:15] <erry> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'slideDown'
[03:09:52] <Noor_egy> umm
[03:10:38] <GoddeR> $('.oddbox')[0] refers to html element
[03:10:49] <GoddeR> html element does not have slide down method
[03:11:02] <GoddeR> when you do var asdfsdf = $('.oddbox')[0]
[03:11:07] <GoddeR> you store html element
[03:11:20] <GoddeR> if you do $('.oddbox')[0].slideDown(1100);
[03:11:23] <GoddeR> works O:
[03:12:06] <GoddeR> i think
[03:12:07] <GoddeR> .)
[03:12:10] <Noor_egy> umm
[03:12:53] <GoddeR> nah im wrong
[03:13:00] <Woet> yes, var works just fine
[03:13:06] <Woet> var element = $("#hello");
[03:13:09] <Woet> element.fadeOut(1000);
[03:13:10] <Woet> is fine
[03:13:50] <GoddeR> $('.class:first') instead of $('.class')[0]
[03:13:59] <Noor_egy> could anyone help me with mine :/
[03:14:15] <GoddeR> noor be more demanding im sure someone will help
[03:14:17] <GoddeR> :D
[03:14:38] <Noor_egy> :/
[03:14:48] <GoddeR> ;\ ;/ ;\ ;/
[03:17:26] <Noor_egy> im using plugin to validate my forms and another plugin to send ajax requests to my server now when I try to mix them the syntax be like this http://jsfiddle.net/fd9yr/1/ but the propleme that the form is generated in the fly I mean that you need to use ('#formname').live()
[03:17:38] <Woet> Noor_egy: your question is not making any sense.
[03:17:48] <Noor_egy> well
[03:17:52] <Noor_egy> im having form
[03:17:58] <Noor_egy> that will generated in the fly
[03:18:10] <Noor_egy> its name is updatemepsave
[03:18:34] <Noor_egy> I want it when I make save and before submit make validation then submit using ajax
[03:18:59] <Rotham> your validating it server side as well right?
[03:19:15] <Noor_egy> no only using jquery validation plugin
[03:19:22] <Noor_egy> right now
[03:19:24] <Woet> Noor_egy: okay, and so what exactly is the issue?
[03:19:28] <Woet> what does it and what should it do?
[03:19:49] <Noor_egy> well when I used the ajax plugin in jform
[03:20:02] <Noor_egy> I found it sending more tha request to the server
[03:20:30] <Noor_egy> I mean send it more than one time cause I may generate the form more than time in operation
[03:21:01] <Noor_egy> I thought I need to use ("#saveform").live("submit"
[03:21:04] <Noor_egy> is that rye
[03:21:07] <Noor_egy> true *
[03:21:12] <Noor_egy> ?
[03:21:15] <Woet> Noor_egy: either submit your entire code through jsfiddle or give a link
[03:22:19] <Noor_egy> http://jsfiddle.net/fd9yr/1/
[03:22:26] <Noor_egy> tahts the code im using
[03:22:29] <Noor_egy> in jquery
[03:23:01] <Noor_egy> this code regenrated every time I generate the form in the fly
[03:23:10] <Noor_egy> so it may be generated more than atime
[03:33:00] <coldhead> walid: hard to tell what it should be doing and how it isn't >: |
[03:33:39] <Woet> coldhead: i asked him for clarification, but it's basically his first question broken up in smaller pieces
[03:34:21] <walid>  coldhead what i'm trying to do is what is displayed in the example
[03:34:24] <walid> http://razorjack.net/quicksand/demos/one-set-clone.html
[03:34:43] <coldhead> yes but you'll grant that looks quite different to yours
[03:34:50] <coldhead> not just in that It Works :)
[03:36:36] <walid> coldhead: well this is just an try for me
[03:36:54] <walid> to understand
[03:37:03] <coldhead> we'll do our best to help
[03:37:26] <walid> but i want that when i click on 'program', it will sort by data-type, when you click on size, it will sort by data-size
[03:37:55] <donCams> hi. i'm looking for a plugin that is kind of like an icon dock but icons doesn't expand.. and since it will have a fixed width, i want it to scroll
[03:38:01] <walid> and then, eventually also when you click on 'housing' it would display only housing items(this could of course be done without quicksand
[03:38:02] <coldhead> is there a newer version than http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/W2YqZ/ ?
[03:38:21] <walid> coldhead: nope
[03:38:56] <Woet> does anyone know a good jquery physics engine/plugin?
[03:39:30] <coldhead> Woet: have a poke around mr doob's site :\
[03:39:54] <Woet> coldhead: i'm using box2d right now, which is what he used I believe
[03:40:07] <Woet> but it's missing quite a few essential features to interact with the world
[03:42:09] <Woet> coldhead: you mean http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/ball-pool/ ?
[03:42:47] <coldhead> no i think i was thinking of the box2d one
[03:42:47] <coldhead> this has some i wasn't aware of http://www.queness.com/post/3296/8-amazing-javascript-experiments-of-physic-and-gravity-simulation
[03:42:57] <coldhead> that's all i got
[03:43:10] <Woet> ball pool of mr doob uses box2d
[03:43:16] <Woet> google gravity too
[03:43:33] <coldhead> mr doob is the expert
[03:44:54] <Woet> coldhead: "This demo is using Mr.doob's improving version of Box2DJS. Thanks Mr.doob!"
[03:45:03] <coldhead> lol
[03:45:17] <Peter`> Woet...
[03:45:35] <Woet> hi peter
[03:47:27] <Woet> Peter`: did you have anything to comment, or is that just your way to say hi? :)
[03:47:34] <walid> coldhead: sry, this is the last version: http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/W2YqZ/
[03:47:55] <Guest62794> i am trying to do something like when i click something and my div's text which is number will + 1 can anyone help?
[03:49:12] <Woet> Guest62794: $("#element").click(function(){ $("#counter").text(parseInt($("#counter").text()) + 1) });
[03:49:22] <Woet> and please look at the jquery docs to understand that code so you can learn from it
[03:49:50] <Guest62794> Woet thanks for the quick respond cheers.
[03:50:00] <Woet> Guest62794: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ http://api.jquery.com/text/ http://api.jquery.com/click/
[03:50:18] <Guest62794> Woet: thanks man..
[03:50:45] <Peter`> Oh no. I don't have any intention to say hi. I just wanted to make a remark about your presence here.
[03:50:56] <Woet> okay, I'm aware of my presence - thanks.
[03:51:00] <Woet> coldhead: i'll contact mr doob, thanks!
[04:00:54] <Lundy> is there a way of searching if a ID has been set on a page?
[04:01:01] <Woet> Lundy: if($("#id")){
[04:01:46] <Woet> or, if($("#id").length !== 0){
[04:01:48] <Lundy> :$ feel so bad now
[04:01:55] <kelthar> why?
[04:02:11] <Woet> because learning is a bad thing, kelthar!
[04:02:15] <Lundy> cuz I should hav known that
[04:02:17] <kelthar> Woet: hehe
[04:02:31] <GoddeR> woet is 2 fast
[04:02:53] <GoddeR> look away for a minute 2 problems solved
[04:03:55] <coldhead> walid: http://jsfiddle.net/W2YqZ/4/
[04:04:14] <coldhead> so far i've convinced myself your sorted function works
[04:04:30] <walid> i copy pasted it from the example
[04:04:30] <coldhead> but i don't understand why $filteredData ends up empty
[04:04:51] <coldhead> i changed the if () match to handle Program and program
[04:05:03] <coldhead> but... hmm...
[04:06:12] <walid> coldhead: hmm.. that is weird, indeed... also, shouldn't $data.length be more than 1?
[04:06:34] <coldhead> no, the 1 just indicates that it's the one div with that id
[04:06:40] <coldhead> that's fine
[04:07:07] <walid> coldhead: ok (sorry, this is my 3rd or 4th javascript ^^)
[04:07:30] <coldhead> no problemo
[04:07:56] <thuydang> Hi jquery experts!
[04:08:00] <walid> if you put it outside of the if statement, it's length is 5
[04:08:18] <walid> (that is, the length of $data.find(li)
[04:09:12] <coldhead> woah okay
[04:11:31] <walid> also, $filterType.text().match(/'program'/i) isn't true. i think i mixed up the 2 sort/filter triggers
[04:13:29] <walid> coldhead: i'll quickly remove the filtering, so that i can focus on the sorting.
[04:14:31] <coldhead> the filtering seemed fine to me
[04:14:41] <coldhead> i'm going to wash some dishes, link me to where you get up to
[04:15:46] <walid> coldhead: will do that
[04:15:50] <walid> (y)
[04:15:52] <walid> thx again
[04:32:46] <coldhead> any news, walid?
[04:39:23] <boban_> hi
[04:39:38] <Woet> bye
[04:41:59] <mipo> hello
[04:42:08] <GoddeR> herro
[04:42:27] <mipo> How to send a value wih .load without $("")?
[04:42:55] <mipo> similar $.load().... I need the return of that
[04:43:48] <Woet> mipo: $.ajax('/meh', function(data){ alert(data) });
[04:43:56] <Woet> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[04:44:03] <Woet> and http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ and http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[04:44:13] <logiclord> is there any linked list interface in jquery ?
[04:44:23] <mipo> Thanks Woet
[04:44:42] <Woet> logiclord: how do you mean? $("a")?
[04:47:15] <logiclord1> @Woet i want to create a dynamic linked list using object of parents and child classes  similar to java
[04:47:43] <walid> coldhead: sry got distracted
[04:48:01] <walid> let me finish what i'm doing on the code, i cleaned it a little, then i'll hit you up
[04:48:49] <coldhead> walid: http://jsfiddle.net/W2YqZ/5/ this is my latest
[04:49:00] <coldhead> check the console
[04:49:20] <walid> http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/W2YqZ/6/
[04:49:50] <coldhead> ah okay, igniore mine
[04:55:35] <walid> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/W2YqZ/7/
[04:55:52] <walid> coldhead: i'm not sure i understand very well how this sorting function works
[04:56:15] <mipo> Woet , how to use .load value without any return?
[04:56:19] <coldhead> walid: i don't think it matters
[04:56:30] <Woet> mipo: use .ajax, .post or .get
[04:56:40] <walid> coldhead: but the argument i was passing it was defo wrong
[04:56:40] <mipo> similar this : $.load('file','data',function...
[04:56:57] <mipo> I can use $.post and $.get!
[04:57:03] <mipo> I want to use .load
[04:57:04] <Woet> yes, you can.
[04:57:07] <Woet> but
[04:57:08] <walid> coldhead: i made an attempt of a new argument, not sure it works though...
[04:57:14] <Woet> you want to use load without putting it in an element?
[04:58:41] <coldhead> walid: check the console here, it works: http://jsfiddle.net/W2YqZ/9/
[04:59:02] <mipo> yes
[04:59:24] <Woet> mipo: then use .get, .post and .ajax
[04:59:39] <Woet> .load is made *specifically* to put it into an html element
[05:00:12] <Woet> .get works the exact same way, it just doesn't put it into an element.
[05:00:15] <walid> coldhead: hm but how does it know by what to sort?
[05:00:36] <coldhead> i'm getting there
[05:00:37] <walid> cause here you're sorting by content, and i would want to sort it by attr
[05:00:38] <mipo> ok
[05:00:38] <mipo> thanks
[05:00:47] <coldhead> at the moment it sorts alphabetically by text
[05:00:51] <walid> coldhead: and hey thanks a lot for your help
[05:00:55] <coldhead> by text()
[05:01:15] <mipo> Woet my data in send is : data : id + '/u'
[05:01:27] <mipo> and url is name of a function
[05:01:52] <coldhead> walid: http://jsfiddle.net/W2YqZ/11/
[05:01:54] <Woet> mipo: what is not working? show the code?
[05:01:55] <coldhead> check that in the console
[05:02:00] <coldhead> ProgramScale ?
[05:02:27] <walid> should this be changed, maybe?       by: function(a, criteria) { return a.attr(criteria); }
[05:03:06] <coldhead> that might work
[05:03:10] <mipo> Woet , wait for sending code
[05:03:10] <mipo> Woet , I use codigniter
[05:03:39] <walid> coldhead: $filterSort should be $(this).text(), of course
[05:03:58] <coldhead> right, i just made that change
[05:04:39] <Tomashe> hey guys
[05:05:00] <walid> coldhead: but don't you think we should modify the sorting fct to take 2 arguments, the item AND the attribute by which we want to sort?
[05:05:17] <Tomashe> $(".this").parent().parent().remove(); any idea why this is not removing <tr><td><img class"this"></td></tr>
[05:05:50] <Tomashe> i want to remove the <tr>
[05:05:51] <coldhead> walid: i think you might want two sort functions, depending on whether you're sorting by text() or by .data('scale')
[05:06:45] <walid> coldhead: well i never want to sort by text, so... ;)
[05:07:05] <coldhead> i thought sorting by Program was meant to sort by text
[05:07:18] <coldhead> but okay, type vs size
[05:07:22] <coldhead> lemme fiddle that up
[05:08:02] <walid> coldhead: even though i WILL want to add a sort by date fct, but i can also print that in a data-date attr
[05:08:09] <mipo> Woet : http://pastie.org/2022123
[05:08:15] <walid> rather than use the text of it
[05:08:41] <Woet> mipo: and what does it do? and what should it do?
[05:08:55] <walid> so that doesn't really make a difference, plus i thin it's much more generic to sort by attribute, rather than text or whatever
[05:09:25] <coldhead> walid: as long as you always sort by data, what you have should be okay
[05:09:29] <coldhead> data-whatever
[05:09:34] <coldhead> they're all equivalent
[05:10:31] <Tomashe> ?
[05:10:40] <walid> coldhead: exactly. otherwise i'll add a third argument to the function, and have smth like if(sortType == 1) a.text() else if (sortType ==2), a.attr(attrArgument)
[05:10:44] <walid> or smth
[05:11:12] <mipo> Woet , I wan to send id of checkboxs that checked and 'u' work to a function in my php , my php function($id,$state)
[05:11:36] <coldhead> walid: return ($(v).find('li').attr('data-' + sortByWhat));
[05:11:39] <coldhead> should be
[05:11:54] <coldhead> return ($(v).attr('data-' + sortByWhat));
[05:12:02] <coldhead> because v is already a li
[05:12:07] <walid> coldhead: right
[05:12:52] <Woet> mipo: okay, and it doesn't work? what does it do instead? did you debug it? do you have any errors?
[05:14:11] <Tomashe> why remove isnt working at all
[05:14:35] <Tomashe> $.post('include/delete.php',{action: '1', id: pid, image: num}, function(data) { $(this).parent().parent().remove(); });
[05:14:35] <GoddeR> should be
[05:14:40] <GoddeR> class="this"
[05:14:45] <mipo> have no any error!
[05:15:01] <Tomashe> $(this). = class"this"
[05:15:17] <mipo> Woet , when I say show me all post , that shows me empty array
[05:15:22] <Tomashe> i want to remove the <tr> after i delete an item
[05:15:40] <GoddeR> $(".this") == <img class="this" />
[05:15:52] <Tomashe> yes
[05:16:01] <Tomashe> i know
[05:16:17] <coldhead> walid: http://jsfiddle.net/W2YqZ/15/
[05:16:29] <coldhead> that is showing reasonable sorting in the console
[05:16:42] <coldhead> so if it's still not working it must be the call to quicksand
[05:17:02] <Woet> mipo: please read http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ regarding how to pass data
[05:17:10] <Woet> other than that, it looks fine - not an issue with jquery.
[05:17:14] <mipo> Woet , thanks
[05:18:08] <walid> coldhead: man, we're almost there!
[05:18:48] <GoddeR> Tomashe
[05:18:50] <GoddeR> http://jsbin.com/uveci6/10/edit
[05:18:52] <GoddeR> works
[05:20:53] <walid> coldhead: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRSz8sbNlmY just a little thanks
[05:21:20] <Tomashe> totaly weird
[05:21:50] <GoddeR> class"this" needs to be class="this"
[05:22:04] <GoddeR> and $(".this") to select it
[05:22:38] <Tomashe> i fixed it but still nothing , i think something else is mess it
[05:22:41] <Tomashe> let me recheck
[05:25:57] <walid> http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/W2YqZ/17/
[05:28:52] <Tomashe> GoddeR
[05:29:06] <Tomashe> if the actions is inside a post callback function
[05:29:11] <Tomashe> it could effect?
[05:29:43] <coldhead> walid: http://jsfiddle.net/W2YqZ/19/
[05:29:48] <coldhead> that seems to work the first time >: \
[05:31:03] <GoddeR> Tomashe no it should be fine
[05:31:13] <walid> coldhead: lol, i was gonna make an 'empty' call of quicksand onLoad, to simulate that first call ;)
[05:31:15] <GoddeR> $.post('include/delete.php',{action: '1', id: pid, image: num}, function(data) { $(this).parent().parent().remove(); });
[05:31:17] <GoddeR> should be
[05:31:23] <GoddeR> $.post('include/delete.php',{action: '1', id: pid, image: num}, function(data) { $(".this").parent().parent().remove(); });
[05:31:26] <walid> but your method seems much better, i must say ;)
[05:31:26] <mipo> Woet : http://pastie.org/2022177
[05:31:43] <coldhead> WHY DOESN'T IT FUCKING WORK THOUGH
[05:32:01] <Woet> coldhead: your head doesn't seem so cold
[05:32:04] <walid> coldhead: at the first call?? no idea, that's crazy, i admit
[05:32:52] <walid> coldhead: hmm you're rght, it doesn't work
[05:33:17] <walid> maybe i will then make a simulation call when i load the page, just to solve this.
[05:34:06] <Tomashe> yes it was the issue
[05:34:15] <Tomashe> cyuz i used $(this)

[06:16:17] <impi> mmm i have a question, on loading this site, http://www.micket.me/ i say "show event filters" which if you click on show the filters, but now if you click on a filter like "south africa" it still says "show event filters" i want to change that to "hide event filters"
[06:18:03] <impi> i think it's some of my code in my site-effects file :( an if statement written in y n00b stylez..lol

[08:06:24] <kapowaz> does any jQuery method exist for determining the index of an element relative to its siblings?
[08:06:46] <kapowaz> so, say you had a table row with 10 TDs in it, to determine which Nth that TD was?
[08:06:59] <kapowaz> I'm about to write one and I'd hate to duplicate work :)
[08:08:54] <StevenBlack> kapowaz: .index()  http://api.jquery.com/index/
[08:10:37] <kapowaz> perfect!
[08:10:53] <kapowaz> a name I hadn't considered. I was going to call my method siblingIndex, but there we go.
[08:12:08] <kapowaz> hmm, doesn't quite do what I want though. It can only determine the index relative to its parent.
[08:13:00] <kapowaz> think I can twist it into doing what I need though
[08:13:38] <StevenBlack> kapowaz: rows can only contain TDs... Check out .filter() to winnow elements of a certain type.  .end() gets you back to the original collection.
[08:14:25] <Rahly> or whitespace
[08:14:30] <kapowaz> well, rows can contain THs too but it's ok, I was actually trying to determine the index for an input inside a TD
[08:14:40] <kapowaz> $(inputElement).parent('td').index() does the trick
[08:24:53] <mbutubuntu> hello folks, I need to select a custom html object <myObj:foo>, how to select it with jquery?
[08:27:49] <kapowaz> when you say ‘HTML’ you mean custom XML, right?
[08:28:31] <mbutubuntu> yes, xhtml :-)
[08:29:01] <kapowaz> well, there's no tag called myObj
[08:29:06] <kapowaz> so it's not XHTML
[08:29:49] <mbutubuntu> ok, I've confused ideas about differences between XML, HTML and XHTML....
[08:30:02] <kapowaz> possibly, but that may well be irrelevant.
[08:30:14] <mbutubuntu> for example Google +1 button is used with a custom tag like this <g:plusone></g:plusone>
[08:30:20] <mbutubuntu> so it is XML, right?
[08:30:28] <kapowaz> I believe so
[08:30:35] <kapowaz> where <g:> is the namespace
[08:30:42] <mbutubuntu> so I need the same
[08:30:53] <kapowaz> you've tried $('myObj:foo') already ?
[08:31:02] <mbutubuntu> yes, it doesn't work
[08:31:13] <Rahly> i've been reading ECMA-262, does anyone know if there is a proposed way of determining if you are in strict mode?
[08:31:47] <kapowaz> then I'm not sure. sorry :|
[08:33:44] <andrewebdev> is there a way to 'sequentially' loop through every element that is returned by a selector? the .each() method doesn't work for me cause it updates all items at the same time. I need to update only one at a time.
[08:35:18] <Rahly> what do you mean by update?
[08:36:44] <andrewebdev> Rahly, I have to update a attribute within each element, but this needs to happen after evaluating what happened on previous elements
[08:38:23] <Rahly> well, each doesn't update items.  Sound like the logic in the each function is flawed then.
[08:41:25] <Rahly> And without know what jquery you are using, I don't think you can reliably get order from a selector.
[08:42:42] <andrewebdev> Rahly, this post actually contains the same kind of logic i'm after, excep that I cannot really manipulate my timer in my instance. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1396033/using-jquery-to-iterate-through-elements-with-a-timer
[08:42:54] <andrewebdev> But I'm reading through the other solutions in there
[08:45:25] <Rahly> well its creating new timers, not manipulating
[08:48:06] <Diverdude> How can i set an initial rating value in thisplugin: http://www.myjqueryplugins.com/jRating ?
[08:49:02] <andrewebdev> Rahly, I just discovered the flaw.... it's my lack of knowledge on how timers work -_-
[08:49:20] <andrewebdev> I'll have to read up a bit more about the internals, thanks for the attempts anyway :)
[08:50:55] <Diverdude> figured it out
[09:01:22] <bid> hi, can i $("#elm").append("<script> tag here</script>") ? is there a limitation on <script> ?
[09:24:26] <netAction> Hello! How do I determine the location of the scriptfile I am running?
[09:24:33] <netAction> I need the directory.
[09:25:04] <netAction> It is neccessery to load more jQuery code.   var t = $('<script></script>');  t.attr('src','canvas/canvas.js');  t.attr('type','application/javascript');
[09:26:58] <Rahly> don't you know the location?  canvas/ ?
[09:27:07] <imsky> good sunday all
[09:27:19] <netAction> It is relative to the .js file but not to the html page.
[09:27:42] <netAction> If the js file is in a different direcotry than the html it does not work.
[09:29:05] <Rahly> ummm canvas is relative to the .html file... canvas/  would be a directory under the .html unless, you have a  <base /> defined
[09:29:56] <Rahly> if its   /index.html...   then the js file would be /canvas/canvas.js
[09:30:17] <netAction> I have /index.html
[09:30:24] <Rahly> if its /bob/index.html  then the file is in  /bob/canvas/canvas.js
[09:30:26] <netAction> My script is /scripts/script.js
[09:30:41] <netAction> The canvas.js is in /scripts/canvas/canvas.js
[09:31:13] <Rahly> then change your src to be    t.attr('src','scripts/canvas/canvas.js'); ?
[09:31:17] <netAction> I need the path to script.js to load the canvas.js.
[09:31:34] <netAction> That would be easy but is a problem if the script moves.
[09:31:50] <netAction> I use the script on several pages.
[09:31:52] <Rahly> thats why you use relative paths?
[09:32:09] <netAction> How?
[09:34:01] <netAction> Thanks for the hint with BASE element. It does not help because there are navigation elements in the page.
[09:35:34] <netAction> Rahly: Maybe the only way is to look into the first script element. http://www.bencarpenter.co.uk/javascript-path-to-the-current-script
[09:42:10] <alloc> ey, how I can sort data by First letter at client side, like http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-divider.html ?
[09:42:26] <herrherr_> hi there
[09:42:26] <Rahly> very hacky, esp if you have 2 scripts with the same name, but in different paths
[09:43:13] <Jakey> hackys my middle name :)

[09:57:53] <stefancrs> bbq
[09:58:03] <stefancrs> had bbq for lunch!
[09:58:17] <Rahly> bbqs are always good
[09:58:59] <stefancrs> I had burgers AND chicken
[10:00:18] <stefancrs> omg
[10:10:19] <mipo> Hi
[10:10:30] <^^^^^^^^> hi
[10:10:35] <^^^^^^^^> stefancrs, omg?
[10:10:40] <stefancrs> bbq
[10:10:56] <^^^^^^^^> omg bbq?
[10:11:01] <mipo> ^^^^^^^^ , your name is so happy!
[10:11:02] <mipo> ;)
[10:11:43] <Rahly> omgwtfbbq?
[10:11:43] <^^^^^^^^> yes i am mipo ^_^
[10:12:41] <mipo> I have a checkbox in div tag and I have a function when I click on div tag that shows me alert! but when I click on checkbox , that shows me alert again
[10:13:07] <mipo> I want when I click on checkbox the dont shows me an alert!
[10:13:12] <mipo> how?
[10:15:42] <Rahly> either don't put the checkbox in the div, or do your own click handler on the checkbox
[10:15:46] <^^^^^^^^> best what to to check
[10:16:07] <^^^^^^^^> the element
[10:16:16] <^^^^^^^^> from the event var
[10:16:22] <^^^^^^^^> that pass to your function
[10:16:51] <mipo> Thanks Rahly
[10:17:08] <^^^^^^^^> heh
[10:17:10] <^^^^^^^^> fine
[10:17:17] <mipo> ^^^^^^^^ , you say I make a function for events?
[10:17:33] <stefancrs> I think he says that you should compare this with the element you want to exclude
[10:17:41] <stefancrs> (or with the single one you want to include)
[10:17:53] <Rahly> is there anyway to have trigger do an async event?
[10:18:26] <new2net> I have a page and I don't have a problem. I made the correct choice using jquery ui.
[10:18:42] <agib> does anyone know if it's possible to detect the css "pointer-events" css property with javascript/jquery?
[10:19:03] <mipo> Rahly , no
[10:19:41] <mipo> Rahly , I dont know
[10:20:35] <oDesk> i really can't get (document).ready to work properly
[10:21:08] <oDesk> the page loads with error function not defined
[10:21:17] <Rahly> agib, getComputedStyle? check for it?
[10:21:37] <Rahly> oDesk, doing something wrong then?
[10:21:48] <oDesk> but when i put the same line into firebug it give no error, my assumption is that the form imput element isn't loaded
[10:21:49] <Rahly> ready works just fine for me
[10:21:49] <mipo> oDesk , work with firebug!
[10:22:32] <Rahly> or the function isn't defined yet?
[10:23:04] <oDesk> Rahly: mipo    what would this do http://pastiebin.com/?page=p&id=4deb696307bfd  ?
[10:23:36] <agib> Rahly: interesting... I tried to use $.support.placeholder = "placeholder" in document.createElement("input"); but that seems to work in all browsers regardless of whether they actually support it
[10:23:37] <oDesk> Rahly: mipo , my understanding is that the script loaded then the action fired after the page loaded
[10:23:41] <Rahly> .getScripts isn't loading the script yet?
[10:23:53] <Rahly> its not synchronous
[10:23:53] <agib> err sorry
[10:23:56] <agib> not thatone
[10:23:56] <oDesk> Rahly: no the script successfully loaded
[10:23:56] <dunkel2> hello guys, im trying to use the $(window).scroll() but it seems like it is not responding:S have any of you had that problem?ç
[10:24:12] <Rahly> right, but its not loaded by the time you get to .tagInput
[10:24:18] <oDesk> Rahly: but then    tagsInput() not defined
[10:24:19] <agib> Rahly: I tried this typeof document.createElement('div').style.pointerEvents == 'string'
[10:25:05] <Rahly> agib: that doesn't work for you?
[10:25:13] <oDesk> Rahly: from the snippet you can see the getScript line comes before tagsInput() function
[10:25:39] <Rahly> right, but it has to do web request which is async to your line
[10:26:15] <Rahly> try
[10:26:17] <oDesk> Rahly: i even tried  .getScript(url, function(){ .tagsInput()});
[10:26:30] <Rahly> $.getScript("script", function() { put code here });
[10:26:53] <oDesk> Rahly: i tried that , but i'll try once more
[10:28:21] <agib> Rahly: that seems to evaluate to true even in browsers like IE8 that don't actually support pointer-events:none
[10:28:31] <agib> also window.getComputedStyle doesn't seem to work in IE
[10:29:28] <oDesk> Rahly: actually it does work,  strange   but anyway it works
[10:29:39] <oDesk> Rahly: thank you
[10:31:11] <Rahly> or you can use
[10:31:36] <Rahly> var x = document.createElement("div").style;  if( "pointerEvents" in x ) { };
[10:33:46] <walid> hey guys!
[10:34:03] <walid> i've been trying to implement quicksand on my site since this morning, and I'm almost there
[10:34:14] <walid> zorjack.net/quicksand/
[10:34:18] <walid> www.razorjack.net/quicksand/
[10:36:24] <GoGoGarrett> That looks really nice
[10:36:55] <agib> Rahly: ah interesting -- that seems to work!
[10:36:56] <agib> thank you
[10:37:20] <agib> I wonder why `typeof document.createElement('div').style.pointerEvents == 'string'` doesn't work but that does...
[10:37:38] <GoGoGarrett> Are you using any css3 animations / scaling or just javascript
[10:38:21] <walid> GoGoGarrett: i'm just implementing the plugin
[10:38:26] <walid> but i get an error:
[10:38:30] <walid> http://vbbros.net/d6/list
[10:38:44] <GoGoGarrett> Ah, gotcha
[10:38:47] <walid> (click on program/Scale/Status
[10:39:03] <walid> GoGoGarrett: it does look really nice, though :)
[10:39:20] <Rahly> agib: because under ie, if you access a css style it doesn't know, it "creates" it in the return value, it seems
[10:39:27] <Acorn> is it possible to have a $.post in a function, and have the function return the response?
[10:40:09] <new2net> quicksand is awesome
[10:40:47] <agib> Rahly: hmm interesting -- the if( "pointerEvents" in document.createElement("div").style; ) { /* this happens in opera even though opera doesn't seem to support pointer-events none */ };
[10:40:55] <Rahly> Acorn: in general, no, but you can make a post sync, by saying $.ajaxSetup({async:false});
[10:41:27] <Rahly> right, agib, because it supports other values
[10:41:36] <walid> new2net: do you have any idea what i do wrong?
[10:41:38] <Acorn> Rahly, would it be better practice to get the user to give my function a callback instead?
[10:41:50] <walid> http://pastebin.com/tySChzh6
[10:42:18] <Rahly> Acorn, yes
[10:42:36] <Rahly> this allows you to make functions on success AND failure
[10:43:07] <new2net> walid: no I actually am a complete javascript novice. I didn't even know it was OOP until a couple of days ago.
[10:43:19] <walid> OOP?
[10:43:23] <Rahly> its not oop
[10:43:24] <walid> hha neither do i ;P
[10:43:43] <walid> object oriented prog?
[10:43:53] <Rahly> thats what i guessed
[10:43:55] <samuelj> Can anyone point out why this isn't updating the list?
[10:44:03] <samuelj>  $.post( '/new', $('form#ideaForm').serialize(), function(data){
[10:44:09] <samuelj> $("ul.ideas").prepend(data);
[10:44:14] <samuelj> });
[10:44:16] <Rahly> cuz the post is failing?
[10:44:23] <samuelj> no the post is working
[10:44:43] <Rahly> then nothing is coming back from the post
[10:44:53] <samuelj> ok I'll take a look
[10:44:54] <Rahly> those are the only 2 things
[10:45:03] <new2net> Rahly: yeah it really seems like it uses structs ... not much abstraction.. or encapsulation... or dispatch... but I'm still a novice so I won't swear to it.
[10:45:10] <Rahly> you should add an error handler to see if you are getting there
[10:45:15] <agib> Rahly: is there any way to tell if it supports the "none" value in opera?
[10:45:30] <Rahly> structs <> object oriented
[10:45:33] <walid> benanne:
[10:46:05] <Rahly> agib: set the value to "none" then read it back, if its not "none" then it doesn't support it
[10:46:33] <new2net> Rahly: I won't argue with that XD
[10:46:33] <Rahly> pointerEvents = "none"; if( pointerEvents != 'none' ) { 'no support'; };
[10:46:41] <walid> benanne: hi! i was suggested to ask you about my problem by coldhead
[10:47:22] <benanne> are you sure he meant me? I have no idea who he is :p
[10:47:27] <Rahly> also, opera seems to only support pointer-events on SVG
[10:47:54] <Replayer> Are storing xml's a good way of keeping user data for my website?
[10:48:09] <Replayer> Like when they create documents on my website, should I use xml as a container?
[10:48:30] <Rahly> depends on the back end, but i've found converting to json, seems to be better overall for storing and sending data back and forth from the server
[10:49:01] <agib> Rahly: $("#middle-overlay").get(0).style.pointerEvents == "none" ? now in firefox, which should support it, $("#middle-overlay").get(0).style.pointerEvents => (an empty string)
[10:49:25] <agib> can't seem to find a consistent way of determining support
[10:49:38] <Rahly> firefox only supported pointerevents on html since 3.6
[10:50:00] <Rahly> 3 and 3.5 do not support it
[10:50:10] <Rahly> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/pointer-events
[10:50:29] <agib> I'm using 4 though
[10:50:44] <Rahly> try setting it, then getting the Computed Style, test that
[10:52:30] <Rahly> works for me in FF 4.0.1
[10:52:38] <agib> ah -- console.log(window.getComputedStyle($("#middle-overlay").get(0)).pointerEvents); => "none"
[10:53:13] <agib> getComputedStyle will only work in some browsers
[10:53:26] <Rahly> var x = document.createElement("DIV");  x.style.pointerEvents = "none"; console.log(x.style.pointerEvents); // prints "none"
[10:56:18] <samuelj> If i return some JSON from sinatra, do i need to deserialize it before i can access its attirbutes?
[10:56:47] <walid> hm i get a weird behaving: toggleClass('classssss') works from the console, but not from the script
[10:57:05] <walid> i get a Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'toggleClass' of undefined
[10:57:24] <Rahly> probably not availiable in the context of your function call?
[10:57:39] <agib> Rahly: opera 11.11 prints out "none" too, but it doesn't actually support it
[10:58:05] <agib> I don't know if there's a clean feature-detection way of doing this... It might need to be browser detection
[10:58:52] <albacker> is it possible to get a slider value outside the function that is linked to the slide event?
[10:59:18] <walid> albacker: save it to a global var?
[10:59:27] <albacker> werd
[10:59:29] <albacker> thanks
[10:59:50] <Rahly> does any of the other tests fail in opera?
[11:01:32] <walid> anyone had trouble using toggleClass?
[11:01:49] <Rahly> i like css, but making it browser compatible can sure slow down the browsers
[11:02:01] <Rahly> walid: nope
[11:02:06] <amid_hasan> I am trying to do a ajax post to a remote script from my mobile device. it's not working. however, if i run the same remote script, locally & its in the same directory, it magically works. HELP!?!
[11:02:29] <walid> Rahly: when i use the console to do toggleClass it works, but from the script i get an error... any idea?
[11:03:11] <agib> Rahly: something like this seems to work though: https://gist.github.com/1009234
[11:03:15] <walid> i had this before, which i fixed by doing some $myclass.removeClass(myclass); $(this).addClass(myclass)
[11:03:21] <walid> but that's quite dirty...
[11:04:09] <Rahly> toggleClass works from script for me
[11:04:38] <Rahly> all it does is add/remove the class, thats it
[11:05:21] <amid_hasan> how do I overcome this jquery issu? : Due to browser security restrictions, most "Ajax" requests are subject to the same origin policy; the request can not successfully retrieve data from a different domain, subdomain, or protocol.
[11:05:38] <Rahly> its not a jquery issue, its  how the browser works
[11:05:46] <walid> Rahly: i get a Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'toggleClass' of undefined
[11:06:01] <amid_hasan> Rahly: how do I make my ajax post call work?
[11:06:04] <Rahly> then i would say there is something wrong with you function
[11:06:13] <walid> lol
[11:06:27] <walid> i copy paste it from my script to my console.. :D
[11:06:29] <AlexC_> morning
[11:06:33] <amid_hasan> origin is: mobile device, remote script is on a different domain
[11:06:34] <Rahly> amid_hasan: depends on the browser.  most browsers won't let you do that
[11:07:14] <Rahly> probably cuz its valid from your console?
[11:07:21] <Rahly> different context
[11:07:42] <walid> Rahly: hm i haven't heard of contexts yet..
[11:08:28] <Rahly> post code to a paste bin?
[11:08:34] <AlexC_> var foo = $("#foo img");  # with this, how can I remove the 5th (i.e. the one I'd get when selecting foo[4]) from this?
[11:09:05] <AlexC_> (not within the selector, it needs to be from the var foo)
[11:09:09] <Rahly> AlexC_: .filter() ?
[11:09:46] <AlexC_> Rahly, would that be quite slow over a large result set of say, 900?
[11:09:49] <Rahly> var foo = $('selector').filter(function() {});
[11:10:50] <Rahly> probably, but you assume that a jquery object will remain an array in the future
[11:11:27] <AlexC_> Rahly, hum, I guess I could but I'd need something more like: foo = $("*", foo).filter(...). With 'foo' I am iterating over it via each(), if a certain condition is met I then want to remove the element from 'foo' so I don't loop over it again upon another event trigger
[11:12:28] <Rahly> don't use each then, use filter
[11:12:31] <new2net> how can I cram an entire table into json? I don't know how many rows or columns I will have
[11:12:57] <Rahly> then test for the conditions in the function
[11:13:33] <new2net> every cell has a unique ID*
[11:13:41] <Rahly> return true to keep it in the list, false to remove it
[11:14:58] <AlexC_> Rahly, a ha! Perfect. Thank you
[11:15:03] <agib> Rahly: I think I'm going to go with something like this: https://gist.github.com/1009234
[11:15:28] <Skola> what are some things to look into when optimizing any animate() for performance?
[11:15:52] <Rahly> agib: sounds good then, only cuz of opera though :P
[11:15:57] <Skola> or just rendering in general, like CSS3 vs images
[11:16:21] <agib> Rahly: yeah, unfortunately... sucks that it's always so hard to support this kind of stuff x-browser
[11:16:42] <Rahly> generally though, they are announcing support, but really do not
[11:16:51] <Rahly> they are doing it wrong
[11:17:11] <agib> very treu
[11:17:13] <agib> true
[11:18:14] <Rahly> everytime i see that gist, i think of GiST
[11:18:21] <Rahly> very confusing
[11:19:48] <GoGoGarrett> I has a questionnn but it's more so for real life. I'm currently going to school for computer science, but is it really necessary if i'm going to be a front end dev, i'm looking at job's online and they pretty much just want you to be able to do it, and don't really require any specific degrees
[11:20:12] <Skola> Garrett, I study graphic design
[11:20:19] <Skola> and web
[11:20:33] <Skola> you'd think that fit the bill for most front-end jobs (+ some JS)
[11:20:38] <Rahly> as long as its WEB front end dev
[11:20:47] <Skola> but I care about the backend too
[11:21:08] <Skola> so I learned Haskell, JS, python, etc
[11:21:27] <Skola> it's good to know your algorythms and networking stuff
[11:21:31] <Skola> even if you do frontend
[11:21:59] <Skola> + you have more job options if you can do both front and backend
[11:22:13] <Rahly> all languages are generally the same, its just a matter of good reference document
[11:22:52] <Skola> nah Haskell for example is quite different from say JS
[11:23:13] <Skola> but it gives you a lot of nice ideas to incorporate in your JS code
[11:23:20] <GoGoGarrett> Yeah I understand, I just didn't know if it was required for most jobs to have a specific degree, even if it is just for show that you can finish something
[11:23:32] <GoGoGarrett> I work for a small firm, but it's not an offical 7-5 job
[11:23:47] <Rahly> still has functions and variables, assignment statements, etc
[11:24:02] <Skola> doesn't have variables
[11:24:20] <Skola> not in the sense that JS has them
[11:25:07] <impi> GoGoGarrett, i never had money to study, and neither did my mom to pay for me, everything i know i learned from google. but. i wish i could have gone through the student years...i feel a gap there so study and get that degree - and while you at it, kick ass and show your fellow students how smart you are =)
[11:25:10] <Rahly> they are just mutating
[11:26:00] <Rahly> there are slight quirks for every language.  the quirk, is that its a functional language
[11:26:03] <GoGoGarrett> I feel like I am pretty much in the same boat, I'm doing all online studies through Bellevue.  So most of the stuff is self taught through books, or google. haha
[11:26:15] <GoGoGarrett> I get screen cast of lectures, so it's not like actual hands on teaching I supose
[11:26:46] <AlexC_> GoGoGarrett, a piece of paper saying you an do something is a lot different to having a project you made yourself to show you can do something. Real world experience is all you need in this field
[11:27:11] <Skola> I can confirm that
[11:27:25] <Skola> but it might still be valuable to finish your studies
[11:27:32] <GoGoGarrett> I mean I'm sure both would be great to show, a degree as well as good projects I've worked on, but i just didn't know if it was actually reqiured to have the piece of paper at the interview
[11:28:07] <Skola> depends on the job
[11:28:12] <Rahly> not required, generally though
[11:28:39] <GoGoGarrett> I'd like to have some what of a regulated job, salary / benfits ect. instead of just mostly freelance
[11:28:44] <AlexC_> GoGoGarrett, I have a national diploma in Multimedia (arty farty stuff) and I've yet to be declined a job as a web application developer. Anyone can essentially go to uni and get a piece of paper
[11:29:06] <Skola> _finish_ some good projects
[11:29:51] <GoGoGarrett> Alrighty, I just wanted to get some opinions :]
[11:45:15] <Rahly> jslinux is a pretty kewl, but is kinda useless
[11:45:37] <Skola> more of a proof-of-concept thing I guess
[11:45:55] <Rahly> if we had the devices html5 element, i could see it being way kewl
[11:52:30] <new2net> jslinux... i thought that was hax when i saw it
[11:58:18] <GoGoGarrett> wow that's interesting
[11:59:01] <Rahly> what is?
[12:00:29] <GoGoGarrett> http://chrysaora.com/
[12:01:18] <Rahly> yeah, webgl is awesome, i just hate how many pcs it wont run on
[12:01:30] <Tant102> Just like Windows 3.11.
[12:01:36] <Tant102> It's a mess to install.
[12:02:04] <Rahly> Windows for Workgroups
[12:03:47] <Rahly> i've also heard, that some browsers are going to be removing a lot of the webgl features, based on security concerns.
[12:04:13] <GoGoGarrett> lame, who needs to be secure when you can see sweet jellyfish
[12:04:19] <Rahly> lol
[12:09:11] <Rahly> i did a sample a few months ago, doing 3d without using webgl
[12:09:38] <GoGoGarrett> What'd you do
[12:09:56] <Rahly> just something simple
[12:10:07] <Rahly> http://dl748.dyndns.org:8080/3d.html
[12:10:41] <GoGoGarrett> That's prety sweet
[12:11:11] <GoGoGarrett> Crazy thing is, that can all be achieved with the new Css3 properties, currently only supported I believe in safari
[12:11:14] <Rahly> pretty simplistic, but doesn't require the webgl part, straight canvas
[12:11:40] <GoGoGarrett> Idk if you've ever messed with Allegro, but Canvas reminds me of it so much
[12:12:00] <Skola> what are some things to look into when optimizing any animate() for performance?
[12:12:03] <Rahly> i wish they'd make svg more powerful
[12:12:43] <Rahly> the scaling aspect makes it much better flash replacement
[12:12:45] <GoGoGarrett> I wish I was good at javascript haha
[12:12:51] <Skola> svg is pretty nice with RaphaelJS
[12:14:33] <Rahly> i've still found it pretty slow with animation though, at least in most browsers, takes a horrendous amount of cpu
[12:15:03] <Skola> hm ya you need to really watch performance
[12:15:14] <Skola> dynamically spawning DOM nodes is a no-no for example
[12:15:28] <Skola> I made a timeline with raphael
[12:15:37] <Skola> like 1000+ objects
[12:15:44] <Rahly> not as bad as moving them though
[12:15:56] <Skola> true, it's really expensive
[12:16:08] <Skola> but the worst things is that browser performance varies wildly
[12:16:15] <Rahly> yeah
[12:16:45] <Rahly> everyone things they know what developers use, but heres the thing... if it performs badly, no one is going to use it....
[12:16:49] <Rahly> *thinks
[12:17:21] <Skola> yes
[12:17:32] <Skola> and needs a lot of hacks to make it perform
[12:18:50] <Rahly> i have a backend system that when you request say "x/my.js" it serves up js based on jsengine, so that helps
[12:30:42] <impi> night guys and girls!
[12:30:47] <impi> thanks for all the help,
[12:31:47] <mipo> this is my code: http://pastie.org/2023732 , but send me one checkbox! I need all checkbox that checked!
[12:32:00] <thathurts> Skola: <Skola> dynamically spawning DOM nodes is a no-no for example
[12:32:03] <thathurts> Skola: example?
[12:34:22] <Skola> thathurts, creating paths based on a trigger
[12:34:30] <Skola> (an event)
[12:34:51] <GoGoGarrett> Doesn't it cause a reflow everytime
[12:34:57] <Skola> it's better if possible to create it at document ready
[12:34:59] <GoGoGarrett> you spawn a new dom node
[12:35:12] <Skola> and then just show/hide
[12:35:18] <Skola> I'm not sure Garrett
[12:37:32] <thathurts> Skola: i need to fix a javascript frequently asked questions thing ih ave
[12:37:51] <thathurts> Skola: because i'm dynamically changing the paths of image icons to show and hide questions and answers
[12:38:02] <thathurts> and it sucks, because the first time you load an image, there's a delay because it's uncached
[12:38:19] <Skola> do you _create_ the element dynamically?
[12:38:23] <Skola> or just showing it dynamically?
[12:39:00] <thathurts> creating it dynamically
[12:39:03] <thathurts> well
[12:39:10] <thathurts> technically i'm just changing the source of the image dynamically
[12:39:34] <Skola> right
[12:39:40] <Skola> might be useful to preload it
[12:39:48] <Skola> either as seperate objects
[12:39:50] <MC_BTay> i'm quite a jquery/javascript noob, but i'm workin on a custom webpage.  currently i have some tabs that i've styled with CSS, and when i click them jquery switches between the pages... i was just wondering, when i click one of those, can i append stuff to the URL? so that a person could perhaps bookmark the state of the query?
[12:40:28] <MC_BTay> i can provide a link if it will be helpful
[12:40:32] <thathurts> MC_BTay: you can use url parameters
[12:40:36] <thathurts> those can be bookmarked
[12:40:50] <thathurts> so let's say you have www.whatever.com?tab=2
[12:40:55] <MC_BTay> right
[12:41:00] <agib> has anyone else noticed this: in IE8 using the `head.insertBefore(scriptElem, head.firstChild);` method of inserting a dynamic script causes the background to flash white?
[12:41:20] <ajpiano> MC_BTay, http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[12:41:54] <thathurts> man
[12:42:01] <thathurts> i get angry whenever i see some cool html5 feature
[12:42:06] <thathurts> because i know i won't be able to use it for years
[12:42:10] <Skola> why?
[12:42:10] <MC_BTay> lol
[12:42:28] <Skola> enterprise/otherwise lame clients?
[12:42:33] <thathurts> yup
[12:43:07] <GoGoGarrett> What cool features are you referring to?
[12:43:14] <Skola> ja recently I had a project where they wanted custom scrollbars
[12:43:21] <Skola> have it work on iPad
[12:43:24] <Skola> AND on IE6
[12:43:26] <Skola> fun times
[12:43:34] <MC_BTay> ajpiano, awesome link!
[12:43:38] <ajpiano> yep
[12:43:55] <MC_BTay> you use this before/often?
[12:44:08] <ajpiano> i have
[12:44:15] <ajpiano> i also work with the guy who's plugin it is
[12:44:24] <ajpiano> many a people have used it to great success
[12:44:26] <MC_BTay> aw shit
[12:44:46] <Skola> I've looked at that before
[12:44:48] <MC_BTay> now i just need to install it and test it out :P
[12:44:51] <Skola> need something like that for my node app
[12:45:15] <thathurts> font rendering with hardware acceleration is still fucked in ff5
[12:45:17] <thathurts> how crappy
[12:45:35] <Skola> I find the new versioning of FF so confusing
[12:46:30] <MC_BTay> ajpiano, so i just need that one file?
[12:46:39] <ajpiano> yessir
[12:46:48] <GoGoGarrett> the whole grouped windows section is interesting, but I haven't found much use for it yet
[12:47:02] <GoGoGarrett> we have tabs, now we can have groups..for our tabs, they want us to live in our browser or something.pft.
[12:47:15] <Skola> I use vimperator anyway
[12:47:20] <Skola> never use mouse
[12:47:26] <GoGoGarrett> As do I
[12:47:36] <Skola> so don't care about the tabs and groups :[]
[12:47:47] <GoGoGarrett> I use vimium in chrome
[12:47:59] <Skola> is it good? :[]
[12:48:06] <GoGoGarrett> Jah I enjoy it
[12:48:18] <Skola> I prefer Chrome, but want my vim keys
[12:48:24] <Skola> I'll try it
[12:48:24] <GoGoGarrett> Doesn't have all the features, and i often do ctrl+d instead of just d
[12:48:25] <GoGoGarrett> but oh well
[12:49:10] <MC_BTay> now i just gotta figure out how to use it :P
[12:50:15] <ajpiano> there are a lot of examples :)
[12:50:31] <Skola> looks very good
[12:50:49] <Skola> will implement it tonight
[12:51:00] <Skola> coincidentally have been looking for exactly that
[12:51:09] <Skola> (jQ bbq)
[12:51:10] <GoGoGarrett> the plugin?
[12:51:15] <mipo> how to alert all checkboxs id if checked?
[12:51:27] <thathurts> does chrome have anything as good as adblock plus?
[12:51:33] <GoGoGarrett> yeah
[12:51:35] <Skola> yep
[12:51:51] <thathurts> auto scrolling is as choppy as fuck in chrome
[12:51:52] <GoGoGarrett> AdBlock- as well as stylebott
[12:51:56] <thathurts> that hurts
[12:52:12] <GoGoGarrett> If you visit sites that have tonsof crappy add's you can disable their certian css (hide div's ect) and it will remember everytime you go to the page
[12:52:24] <amid_hasan> are there any good jquery tuts on incorporating the ontouchstart, move, end event handlers?
[12:52:28] <GoGoGarrett> stylebot == awesome
[12:52:39] <Skola> amid_hasan plenty
[12:52:48] <Skola> but the jQuery documentation should probably get you started
[12:53:02] <Skola> jquery.com also has some links to tutorials on it
[12:56:35] <MC_BTay> ajpiano, are all the best examples on his website?
[12:56:53] <ajpiano> i suppose. i know that jqapi.com uses it
[12:56:55] <ajpiano> as well
[12:57:11] <MC_BTay> okay cool
[12:57:23] <MC_BTay> i'm just not that familiar with JS/Jquery... so this will likely take me a bit lol
[12:57:34] <Skola> do you have a good use-case for it though
[13:01:05] <lost_and_unfound> greetings, running into very weird problem and hope anyone of you will be able to shed some light. when using curl / ff and I access http://server/api/do/this get the return (application/json) {..stuff..}, when calling the same function and debugging with firebug, the response is empty. When copy and paste the link from firebug and copy into ff addresbar, I get the response in json... I am baffeld... any pointers ?
[13:02:25] <ajpiano> lost_and_unfound: you're trying to make an ajax request of a different domain than the site you're on?
[13:02:56] <lost_and_unfound> ajpiano: no, same domain... frontend.domain.tld, calling api.domain.tld
[13:03:08] <ajpiano> those count as different domains for the SOP :/
[13:03:16] <ajpiano> you can set document.domain
[13:03:20] <ajpiano> i think
[13:03:28] <ajpiano> to enable ajax on subdomains on the same domain
[13:04:20] <lost_and_unfound> hmmm....thanks ajpiano, will look into that
[13:07:38] <primepie> if I bind 2 functions to an event (keyup) how can I prevent the second function to get called from the first function ?
[13:12:13] <lost_and_unfound> ajpiano: Due to browser security restrictions, most "Ajax" requests are subject to the same origin policy; the request can not successfully retrieve data from a different domain, subdomain, or protocol. [ http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/ ], thanks fot the pointer, would have taken me some time to find that!
[13:12:57] <ajpiano> yep :p
[13:13:54] <Fretta> using .load is the content loaded into the DOM
[13:14:06] * lost_and_unfound awards ajpiano with 5 geek points... bye!!!
[13:14:40] <Fretta> i noticed i cannot write .click observers on content loaded using .load
[13:14:49] <Skola> use .live
[13:14:54] <Skola> or better .delegate
[13:15:02] <Fretta> Skola, thnx will try now
[13:16:47] <agib> Anyone had experience with v1.6.2pre? is it pretty stable?
[13:17:19] <ajpiano> is there something wrong with 1.6.1 ?
[13:20:22] <MC_BTay> i'm having trouble adapting this jquery bbq to my page :\
[13:21:32] <agib> ajpiano: yeah, the IE8 flash of white background bug
[13:21:40] <agib> ajpiano:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6149820/weird-ie8-layout-glitch
[13:21:59] <ajpiano> and it's already fixed in latest git?
[13:22:14] <thathurts> man microsoft really does suck
[13:22:18] <ajpiano> ah yes, it is
[13:23:15] <agib> ajpiano: I'd like to push to production, but in QA I came across this bug... wondering if I should deploy an old version or an edge version
[13:23:31] <ajpiano> kind of a tough call
[13:23:45] <agib> yeah... I hate deploying old stuff
[13:23:52] <ajpiano> i'd probably go with 1.6.2pre and test a bunch
[13:23:57] <ajpiano> and then get onto 1.6.2 when it's ready
[13:24:05] <agib> going back to 1.6.0 is weird because of the API changes
[13:24:20] <Fretta> does jQuery have a .chop method for strings similar to Ruby
[13:24:25] <ajpiano> yea, that too
[13:24:54] <Skola> Fretta, I use underscore.string for those kinds of things
[13:25:00] <Skola> it has that chop function
[13:25:08] <ajpiano> ya, i'd agree w/ skola
[13:25:13] <ajpiano> all we've got in jquery is $.trim
[13:25:16] <Fretta> Skola awesome thnx
[13:25:22] <ajpiano> and underscore is the bomb
[13:25:36] <Skola> underscore.string can be used stand-alone
[13:25:43] <Skola> or as a mixin with underscore
[13:25:47] <agib> ajpiano: cool. yeah I think I'll give pre a try
[13:25:52] <agib> thank you
[13:26:48] <Skola> underscore let's you write crazy tight functions
[13:27:09] <Skola> together with coffeescript it kicks ass
[13:27:37] <Skola> not an example of good programming
[13:27:41] <Skola> but here's an example function
[13:27:43] <Skola> drop = (ID) -> wS 'index.cm', (_.reject gIx(ix), (x) -> x is gIx(ix)[ID]).join '\n'
[13:27:55] <ajpiano> Skola, i haven't made the coffeescript leap yet, but i am a big backbone/underscore believer now
[13:28:31] <Skola> you can write really pretty/concise code in coffeescript
[13:28:49] <ajpiano> so i am aware
[13:29:05] <ajpiano> i've seen jeremy talk about it at least twice
[13:29:06] <ajpiano> :p
[13:29:27] <Skola> I like pretty code
[13:29:32] <Skola> I usually program my tools in Haskell
[13:30:00] <Skola> but coffeescript + _ "kinda" comes close
[13:30:24] <ajpiano> i barely even approach understanding haskell :/
[13:30:34] <ajpiano> OTOH, i get the idea :p
[13:30:40] <Skola> I bought "Programming in Haskell"
[13:30:49] <Skola> it's great for getting you up to speed on the basics
[13:30:52] <ajpiano> i have heard really good things about learn you a haskell for great good
[13:30:59] <Skola> yep, also a good book
[13:31:10] <ajpiano> so when i unexpectedly fall into a pit of spare time and get bored with everything else, i'll read that :p
[13:31:13] <Skola> I might buy the paper version
[13:31:25] <gym_jane> .seen aamir
[13:31:26] <hsbot> aamir was seen 1 week, 1 day and 10 hours ago, quitting with the message: Quit: Away!
[13:32:13] <Skola> yeah would be good if you did
[13:32:16] <Skola> will improve your JS
[13:32:52] <thathurts> i don't know
[13:33:00] <thathurts> haskell looks pretty ugly semantically
[13:33:09] <thathurts> putStrLn?
[13:33:12] <Jayflux> Skola you use coffescript?
[13:33:15] <ajpiano> we have a bot in another chan that just creates awesome jokes based on inside jokes of people's nicks in haskell...pretty...leet.
[13:33:16] <thathurts> wow that's ugly
[13:33:16] <ajpiano> :p
[13:33:20] <Skola> yes Jayflux
[13:33:36] <Jayflux> is it useful, not used it myself, whats its purpose if you use jquery a lot?
[13:34:01] <Skola> tons of advantages
[13:34:04] <ajpiano> Jayflux, that's like saying who needs a jetpack if you have a car
[13:34:05] <ajpiano> :p
[13:34:18] <GoGoGarrett> combine the two, jetcar
[13:34:26] <Skola> besides the nice syntax, it has amazing 'extras'
[13:34:28] <ajpiano> jaskell?
[13:34:35] <Jayflux> Yeah i get that aj but i was wondering what its main advantages are over jquery and other librarys / frameworks
[13:34:45] <Skola> wait what
[13:34:52] <Skola> were talking coffeescript right Jay?
[13:34:58] <Skola> it compiles down to JS
[13:35:04] <Skola> so you can use it with any JS lib
[13:35:08] <Jayflux> oh right ok
[13:35:31] <Skola> thathurts, putStrLn isn't pretty but the way you can express ideas is
[13:36:05] <mipo> how to set .click function too all div except 1!
[13:36:07] <mipo> ?
[13:36:19] <GoGoGarrett> :nog
[13:36:24] <thathurts> huh?
[13:36:24] <ajpiano> $("div:not(#exceptThisOne)").click(fn);
[13:36:29] <Skola> $('*:not(mydiv)').click
[13:36:30] <GoGoGarrett> :not(div#clss)
[13:36:31] <Skola> :[]
[13:36:33] <GoGoGarrett> roar is ux
[13:36:33] <thathurts> why the hell would you want to do that, though?
[13:36:40] <Skola> yeh is bad idea
[13:37:14] <Jayflux> Skola how long did coffescript take you to get using
[13:37:22] <Skola> 2 days
[13:37:24] <Skola> no kidding
[13:37:31] <Jayflux> ah really, nice
[13:37:32] <Skola> not because I'm so awesome
[13:37:36] <Skola> but because coffeescript is
[13:37:44] <Jayflux> lol @ the hard sell there
[13:37:53] <Skola> ;p
[13:38:06] <mipo> Skola , can't work
[13:38:21] <babonk> is .find('input:first') identical to .find('input:nth-child(1)')?
[13:38:24] <mipo> Skola : $('div:not(#mydiv)').clic ....
[13:38:39] <Skola> can't work? why not
[13:38:43] <ajpiano> mipo: if it isn't working please show a live demo.
[13:38:43] <thathurts> mipo: why don't you tell us what you're trying to do
[13:38:51] <thathurts> because it sounds like a really dumb idea
[13:38:54] <Skola> JayFlux
[13:38:55] <Skola> http://ontwik.com/javascript/jeremy-ashkenas-on-coffeescript/
[13:39:21] <Jayflux> babonk no because I think nth-child is 0 indexed so the second one will get you the 2nd child
[13:39:49] <Jayflux> or i could be wrong about that
[13:39:50] <ajpiano> Jayflux, incorrect
[13:39:50] <Skola> :first === :nth-child(0)
[13:39:54] <ajpiano> guys
[13:39:56] <Skola> really?
[13:40:04] <thathurts> it still pisses me off that .length starts with 1 yet arrays and everything else start with 0. that was so fucking boneheaded of them
[13:40:05] <ajpiano> :nth-child is 1 indexed
[13:40:06] <Jayflux> I dont think it is 0 indexed actually
[13:40:09] <mipo> thathurts : I have a list of messge in a div
[13:40:10] <Skola> lol
[13:40:20] <ajpiano> because it is a nonsensical thing for something to be 0th child of its parent
[13:40:22] <babonk> Skola: i thought it was 1-indexed?
[13:40:26] <mipo> that have list of contact
[13:40:30] <Skola> yep sorry
[13:40:36] <ajpiano> the difference between :first and :nth-child is first will only return one element
[13:40:37] <babonk> ok so its identical
[13:40:40] <ajpiano> it's referring tot he jquery set itself
[13:40:44] <Rahly> people sure are running out of names to call things
[13:40:48] <babonk> i thought nthchild returns one element?
[13:40:48] <Jayflux> yeah babonk
[13:40:51] <ajpiano> :nth-child returns all nth-children
[13:40:59] <ajpiano> :nth-child(1) and :first-child are the same thing
[13:41:12] <babonk> weird, because its not working for me that way
[13:41:16] <ajpiano> :first and :first-child (and therefore :nth-child) are not the same
[13:41:16] <babonk> will debug some more
[13:41:17] <thathurts> mipo: sounds like you want to use event delegation and give everything you want to be clickable a class="clickable" or whatever and that way whenever someone clicks on a div with that class, it'll fire your event
[13:41:38] <mipo> yes!
[13:41:46] <mipo> but no main div
[13:41:47] <babonk> input:first is working for me but not input:nth-child
[13:41:51] <mipo> just children div
[13:42:01] <Rahly> i'm going to make a script and call it Klggcrtfm
[13:42:07] <ajpiano> babonk, use : first-child
[13:42:10] <thathurts> there has to be one main div, right? something has to contain that stuff
[13:42:19] <babonk> ajpiano: its the nthchild that isnt working
[13:42:20] <Skola> lol Rahly yes
[13:42:30] <mipo> yes
[13:42:33] <ajpiano> thathurts, mipo, you can delegate events on the document
[13:42:34] <babonk> $(this).parent().find('input:first') works
[13:42:36] <Jayflux> nth-child(1) babonk you tried that?
[13:42:42] <ajpiano> babonk: please show a test-case
[13:42:43] <babonk> $(this).parent().find('input:nth-child(1)') doesnt
[13:43:02] <thathurts> ajpiano: yeah
[13:43:05] <Jayflux> babonk :first and nth-child(1) are different
[13:43:07] <mipo> ajpiano , what do you mean
[13:43:08] <mipo> ?
[13:43:18] <thathurts> but i still think it's a good practice to have a div containing everything
[13:43:23] <babonk> jayflux: how to get ":second"? (i know thats nonexistent)
[13:43:30] <Rahly> the hello world code will look like this  ( . )( . )
[13:43:38] <ajpiano> $(document).delegate("div:not(#whatever)",  "click" , fn);
[13:43:38] <Jayflux> if you want the second child nth-child(2)
[13:43:41] <GoGoGarrett> haha
[13:43:48] <mipo> ajpiano , no
[13:43:48] <ajpiano> babonk, nth-child(2)
[13:43:54] <ajpiano> no!
[13:43:56] <Jayflux> show a test case like aj said on http://www.jsfiddle.net
[13:43:57] <GoGoGarrett> @Rajly I'll switch to Klggcrfgm
[13:44:01] <babonk> k, will do jay
[13:44:29] <thathurts> ajpiano: i still think he should give all the clickable shit a class="clickable" and then do $(document).delegate(".whatever",  "click" , fn);
[13:44:30] <Rahly> Klggcrtfm
[13:44:30] <Jayflux> because we may be talking about different things here
[13:44:43] <ajpiano> thathurts: why
[13:44:52] <Rahly> i should.... www.klggcrtfm.com is available
[13:44:54] <ajpiano> if the point is for him to do something to all divs except one
[13:45:00] <ajpiano> what's he gonna do just put an if inside the function
[13:45:04] <Jayflux> does delegating from the document take away the whole point of delegation in the first place?
[13:45:15] <Jayflux> thathurts
[13:45:15] <ajpiano> Jayflux, no it doesn't
[13:45:32] <thathurts> ajpiano: but what if he decides to add other divs later that he doesn't want to be clickable? it seems like it'd be cleaner if he can just specify whether it's clickable based on its class
[13:45:49] <Skola> or based on .data if possible
[13:45:57] <ajpiano> i think that having a class of "clickable" is not really like, explicative of what's ahppening
[13:46:06] <ajpiano> using a class is well and good
[13:46:09] <ajpiano> and probably preferable to an id
[13:46:19] <ajpiano> but then the clas should at least be like, not so vague
[13:46:22] <ajpiano> i guess is all i'm sayin
[13:46:43] <thathurts> yeah
[13:46:46] <Jayflux> how so ajpiano? why not just use live then if you're going to do that?
[13:46:49] <thathurts> it was just an example
[13:46:58] <thathurts> he shouldn't use "clickable" specifically
[13:47:02] <mipo> No , I have 3 div! that have some children with a input checkbox
[13:47:12] <Skola> show us :[]
[13:47:20] <ajpiano> Jayflux, live performs an unnecessary dom query, for one :o
[13:47:23] <new2net> $( $( $( ".jquery .curry).function({ this isn't going anywhere
[13:47:27] <mipo> if I click on div that send me alert
[13:47:42] <mipo> and if I click on checkbox , then send me alert again
[13:47:44] <ajpiano> live is such a magic API, i much prefer delegating events ont he document
[13:47:48] <mipo> I dont want this!
[13:47:48] <Skola> new2net that's an epic piece of code
[13:47:51] <ajpiano> mipo: ah
[13:47:54] <ajpiano> you have to do this
[13:48:01] <Jayflux> so ajpiano do you do most of your delegation on the document and not the parent element
[13:48:06] <ajpiano> prevent the propagation of the click event on the checkbox
[13:48:09] <ajpiano> Jayflux, no, not at all
[13:48:16] <ajpiano> it's obviously prefereable to do it lower down in the dom
[13:48:18] <Skola> always parent elem, unless no choice :[]
[13:48:24] <ajpiano> well that's silly
[13:48:39] <ajpiano> delegating to the direct parent only kind of eliminates a lot of the flexibility the whole thing gives you
[13:49:00] <Jayflux> like what?
[13:49:04] <ajpiano> mipo $("div input:checkbox").click(function(e) {  e.stopPropagation(); }); ?
[13:49:09] <systemfault> delegating to the closest parent is the thing to do imho.
[13:49:17] <Jayflux> ^ thats what i thought
[13:49:22] <systemfault> Either using .live or .delegate.
[13:49:31] <ajpiano> it's a super arbitrary distinction to make
[13:49:49] <systemfault> It's a matter of performance.
[13:49:51] <ajpiano> i use backbone, so i delegate events on the "container" of the logical widget
[13:49:53] <systemfault> AFAIK
[13:50:03] <ajpiano> events gonna bubble,
[13:50:17] <Skola> ja but preferably not so far up the tree
[13:50:21] <ajpiano> it ain't gonna be a perf hit to catch it 3 parents high
[13:50:56] <ajpiano> i think it makes much more sense to delegate events to the highest container that contains the entire chunk of functionality.
[13:51:06] <systemfault> ajpiano: That's what I do.
[13:51:07] <Jayflux> like the wrapper
[13:51:08] <Rahly> i've had to remove jquery code for performance... like  element.setAttribute() can be like 200x faster than $(elem).attr();
[13:51:15] <systemfault> ajpiano: It's pretty much never document though
[13:51:26] <mipo> ajpiano , thanks you! Solved!
[13:51:28] <babonk> Ok guys, heres the short code where the selector won't work.  http://jsfiddle.net/w5WES/2/
[13:51:29] <Jayflux> ive never done it as high as the document
[13:51:30] <ajpiano> all the same though, delegate on the document performs better than .live
[13:51:37] <ajpiano> so i guess that is what i am saying about that
[13:52:00] <systemfault> I see
[13:52:06] <mipo> thathurts, thanks!
[13:52:16] <MC_BTay> ajpiano, are there only jquery-bbq examples?
[13:52:22] <ajpiano> huh?
[13:52:48] <MC_BTay> only four**
[13:52:57] <systemfault> Seriously.. what the hell with brackets in element names?
[13:52:58] <Skola> aren't they enough?
[13:52:59] <babonk> What wrong with the nth-child selector here? http://jsfiddle.net/w5WES/2/
[13:53:01] <ajpiano> i gues so?
[13:54:29] <Rahly> i use to have a firefox extension that would communicate with my stove via network.... so in a sense you could have a jquery-bbq extension that controls the temp on the stove
[13:54:51] <ajpiano> babonk, the reason is failing
[13:54:53] <ajpiano> is because the second input
[13:54:55] <ajpiano> is the third child
[13:54:58] <ajpiano> of the element.
[13:54:59] <ajpiano> sooo
[13:55:03] <ajpiano> yea.
[13:55:08] <babonk> is there a way to get the nth input?
[13:55:11] <Jayflux> ^
[13:55:13] <Jayflux> that basically
[13:55:15] <Skola> eq(1)
[13:55:18] <Skola> ?
[13:55:21] <ajpiano> yup ^^
[13:55:27] <Rahly> $('input').index(nth);
[13:55:28] <babonk> input:eq(1) gets 2nd input?
[13:55:33] <lar_zzz> babonk, input:last
[13:55:34] <ajpiano> babonk, yes
[13:55:38] <ajpiano> or that
[13:55:45] <Skola> eq is sexier
[13:55:53] <babonk> i always go with the sexy option
[13:55:55] <Rahly> but returns the object, not a jq obj
[13:56:07] <Rahly> oh wait, my bad, i was thinking of get
[13:56:16] <Skola> :)
[13:56:31] <ajpiano> babonk, you should use .val() instead of .attr("value");
[13:56:31] <Rahly> i love the prop. but i would like the same thing to call a function on the dom object
[13:57:01] <Rahly> like  $jqobj.func("setCapture");
[13:57:04] <babonk> ajpiano: will do.. i was just doing that out of frustration at what could psosibly be wrong with it
[13:57:53] <AaronCampbell> I have a collection of elements (jQuery('.class element')) and I want to get a list (or array) of a certain attribule of each element.  In this case I want 'name' for each element.  Is there a way to do that without using .each to build an array using attr()?
[13:58:22] <ajpiano> AaronCampbell http://ajpiano.com/2010/when-to-use-jquerys-map-methods/
[13:58:29] <Rahly> nope, cuz the prop/attr will only get the first one
[13:58:32] <ajpiano> in short, $.fn.map
[13:59:19] <ajpiano> $(".foo bar").map(function() { return this.name; }).get();
[13:59:37] <babonk> thanks guys!
[13:59:42] <babonk> going to get back to debugging the rest of it
[13:59:45] <babonk> much appreciated
[14:00:33] <Skola> good luck
[14:00:46] <Skola> who told me about the Vimium plugin?
[14:00:51] <Skola> GoGoGarrett?
[14:00:59] <GoGoGarrett> Hey
[14:01:03] <Skola> right
[14:01:04] <GoGoGarrett> Yeah, do you like it?
[14:01:08] <Skola> does it have command mode?
[14:01:23] <GoGoGarrett> nah it's simple a navigator basically
[14:01:28] <Skola> it looks less complete than vimperator
[14:01:43] <GoGoGarrett> It is, but its better than nothing when surfing the web :/
[14:02:09] <Skola> ja but vimperator has loads of useful stuff
[14:02:19] <Skola> though I might look into the docs of Vimium a bit more first
[14:02:27] <MagBo> greetings, gentlemen. i wonder how do i form a json structure from $.('#lol').children().get()'s ids?
[14:02:48] <MagBo> don't use vimperator, please use pentadactyl
[14:03:28] <Skola> each #lol (i, item) object[i] = this.id
[14:03:38] <Skola> you make proper syntax out of that :D
[14:03:48] <Skola> pentadactyl?
[14:03:59] <MagBo> yep. vimperator is deprecated
[14:04:30] <MagBo> the story was that the main dev of vimperator pissed off the most active devs
[14:04:30] <Skola> right thanks, good to know
[14:04:34] <MagBo> and they forked
[14:04:43] <MagBo> your welcome
[14:05:31] <remysharp> Am I wrong in thinking there's some .attr on change callback in jQuery?
[14:05:43] <remysharp> I remember someone was working on something like that a while back...
[14:05:48] <MagBo> Skola: aren't you from Latvia btw?
[14:05:54] <Skola> haha no
[14:05:58] <Skola> am Dutch
[14:06:05] <diegows> hi
[14:06:09] <MagBo> your nick means 'School' in Latvian
[14:06:19] <MagBo> not yours, diegows :D
[14:06:22] <Skola> hah good to know
[14:06:24] <Skola> ;D
[14:06:30] <diegows> is it possible to change the height of the body element using jquery?
[14:06:52] <MagBo> o_0
[14:06:58] <Skola> $('body').css('height': '1000px');
[14:07:10] <Skola> my 'real' nick is Sko
[14:07:17] <Skola> was taken on freenode ;/
[14:07:23] <diegows> Skola: let me try :)
[14:07:25] <Skola> which means shoe in Swedish
[14:07:35] <diegows> i tried with $(document).height(XXX); but nothing
[14:07:44] <MagBo> Skola: lightning fast, well yes, diegows you may do everything with your DOM in jquery
[14:07:55] <MagBo> diegows: might want to read docs lol
[14:08:07] <MagBo> have a look at .css and .attr
[14:08:25] <MagBo> Skola: on my original question, are you sure that there's no shorthand for that?
[14:08:27] <Skola> MagBo pantodactyl feels very snappy
[14:08:33] <MagBo> snappy?
[14:08:39] <Skola> fast
[14:08:40] <Skola> responsive
[14:08:44] <MagBo> ah, ok got it
[14:08:51] <ajpiano> diegows, the document is not the body
[14:08:59] <Skola> your original question was?
[14:09:12] <Skola> using crappy console atm
[14:09:30] <MagBo> about making a json object from children of a $('#lol')
[14:10:18] <ajpiano> $("#lol").children()
[14:10:52] <MagBo> ajpiano: lol ok
[14:11:58] <Skola> should be 2-3 LOC
[14:12:25] <Skola> I think _.reduce would work if you use underscore
[14:12:52] <MagBo> ouuuch
[14:12:58] <ajpiano> oh MagBo
[14:13:01] <ajpiano> you should also use .map
[14:13:02] <ajpiano> lol
[14:13:06] <ajpiano> i just explained that the second i got here
[14:13:12] <ajpiano> i mean, the second before you did
[14:13:18] <MagBo> ajpiano: sorry, i need json made from id's of those
[14:13:27] <ajpiano> an array is json
[14:13:30] <ajpiano> well, can be
[14:13:37] <ajpiano> json is just a string
[14:13:41] <ajpiano> are you looking to make an object?
[14:13:42] <MagBo> i know, ye
[14:14:09] <MagBo> well, i'm looking to form a json string to pass the guy via rpc
[14:14:36] <ajpiano> var foo = {};  $("#lol").children().each(function() {  foo[this.id] = "i don't know why this needs to be an object";  });  JSON.stringify(foo);
[14:14:41] <MagBo> json string consisting from ids of all children of a dom element
[14:14:48] <ajpiano> oh
[14:15:09] <ajpiano> $("#lol").children().map(function() { return this.id; }).get().join();
[14:15:43] <MagBo> yep, that's what i was looking for, my thoughts were dancing around .get()
[14:15:52] <MagBo> i'll test that one, thank you so much
[14:16:43] <Skola> but why do you use id's to construct a json object?
[14:17:20] <Skola> sounds a bit hackish
[14:17:37] <Skola> I know I've committed similar sins in the past
[14:18:13] <Jayflux> lol
[14:19:00] <Skola> I try to keep state out of my DOM
[14:22:18] <affect> hi, I've got jqueryui tabs with input fields inside a jqueryui dialog inside a $(function() {}, somehow it takes a second for input fields to get positioned correctly in ie(7,8). when I switch to a new tab, all input fields are somewhere over the edge of the tab and the dialog and in a second they are positioned properly. what am I doing wrong?
[14:22:49] <Skola> can you show us affect?
[14:22:57] <Skola> might be css problem, can't tell
[14:25:06] <affect> yeah hold on
[14:26:03] <babonk> Has anyone worked with jQuery flexbox?  I'm trying to update the results list after a flexbox has already been initialized
[14:35:15] <diegows> Skola: $('body').css('height': '1000px'); didn't work :(
[14:37:33] <raRaRa> what about css(height: '1000px')
[14:37:43] <raRaRa> just thinking out loud..
[14:38:42] <Skola> diegows why do you want to limit the height of your document?
[14:38:53] <Skola> just so I can give you a better answer
[14:39:35] <diegows> Skola: i don't want to limit it
[14:39:36] <Fretta> does jQuery have an .innerHTML method?
[14:40:03] <Skola> Fretta I think you can do $(window).height()?
[14:40:08] <Skola> don't remember exactly
[14:40:30] <Skola> ehm diegows*
[14:40:46] <Fretta> e.g. <div>foo</div> jQuery('div').innerHTML --> foo
[14:41:05] <Skola> Fretta .text() .val() .html()
[14:41:07] <diegows> Skola: i'm inserting an iframe to every page with js. The iframe is floting always at the bottom of the window. When you reach the bottom of the page that div is hiding some content
[14:41:09] <Skola> play around with those
[14:41:20] <Fretta> Skola ah ok thanks
[14:42:02] <Skola> diegows can you show me?
[14:42:23] <Skola> you want to prevent the iframe from hiding that content?
[14:43:00] <diegows> Skola: yes
[14:43:06] <poppiez> hi, I'm using the ajax form plugin. I'm doing myForm.ajaxForm({ success: function() { alert('success'); }, error: function() { alert('error'); }}); in chrome, "success" is alerted, however, firefox alerts "error". why is this? running firefox 4.0.1
[14:43:45] <Skola> diegows can you show me? there are multiple ways you can fix this
[14:53:49] <MC_BTay> i'm really having trouble with jquery bbq
[14:57:13] <Rahly> chicken or beef?
[14:57:19] <zpoley> beef
[14:57:58] <Rahly> bbq shrimp is awesome too
[14:58:09] <zpoley> nice
[15:22:00] <Rahly> lol thats a hillarious name.... 'named anonymous function'... if its named.. how is it anonymous anymore?
[15:23:03] <GoGoGarrett> should be NOMONOMous imo.
[15:23:14] <Rahly> hiphopanonymous?
[15:23:29] <GoGoGarrett> Close second
[15:47:24] <dirtycockroach> hello
[15:49:01] <dirtycockroach> I know JS but I am new to open source
[15:49:10] <dirtycockroach> I just created an account on Github
[15:50:03] <dirtycockroach> I was just trying to find out how I can contribute to jQuery and found this link
[15:50:04] <dirtycockroach> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/contributing-to-jquery
[15:50:22] <dirtycockroach> I dont know what CLA and stuff means
[15:50:32] <dirtycockroach> Can someone explain it to me?
[15:50:36] <Iszak> contributor license agreement no doubt
[15:50:59] <dabear> ?g cla
[15:51:06] <Iszak> ?define cla
[15:51:12] <ajpiano> dirtycockroach: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement
[15:51:15] <Iszak> can never rely on that bot.
[15:51:21] <ajpiano> we don't have one at present for jQuery
[15:51:29] <dirtycockroach> From what I read about git... I understand that to contribute to a project we first fork it
[15:51:38] <dirtycockroach> Then clone it
[15:51:41] <ajpiano> yes
[15:51:47] <ajpiano> there is a good gist on this
[15:51:47] <dirtycockroach> Then do changes on our system
[15:51:51] <Acorn> What's the best way to have an element hidden or displayed depending on whether a checkbox is checked?
[15:51:53] <dirtycockroach> And then piush it
[15:51:53] <Iszak> then make a pull request
[15:52:02] <babonk> Does anyone here use jquery uniform?  I'm having trouble with a text overflow issue
[15:52:13] <dabear> g your mom
[15:52:17] <dirtycockroach> Great
[15:52:26] <Iszak> dirtycockroach, you don't push it, you send a pull request.
[15:52:33] <Acorn> Should I bind clicks on the checkbox to a function that checks if it is checked or not and then hides or shows the element accordingly?
[15:52:35] <Iszak> people who are trusted may get push ability
[15:52:52] <Acorn> or is there a way to bind a function to the act of checking or unchecking the box?
[15:52:53] <dirtycockroach> Oh ya... right... I am new.. so got confused... right send a pull request
[15:53:02] <dirtycockroach> Thanks!!
[15:53:18] <coldhead> he does it push it to his fork on github
[15:53:23] <coldhead> does push it*
[15:53:35] <Iszak> I kind of cut out the whole cloning thing
[15:53:37] <Iszak> that's his biznit
[15:53:53] <Iszak> that's not github stuff just general git
[15:54:15] <Ownatik> Hey, I have a table row (tr) to which I assign a click event, and inside that row another button to which I'd also like to assign a click event, but when I click the button they both fire... any workaround?
[15:54:15] <dirtycockroach> Ya.. I got it... I push it to my repo... then send a pull req
[15:54:21] <Iszak> ya
[15:54:56] <dabear> Iszak: google for event bubbling .. that's why it happens
[15:55:11] <dabear> Iszak: also, e.stopPropagation();
[15:55:20] <dabear> prevents further bubbling
[15:55:27] <ajpiano> dirtycockroach http://weblog.bocoup.com/javascript-jquery-bug-fixing-guide
[15:55:34] <Acorn> or can I bind to an attribute change maybe/
[15:55:36] <Acorn> *?
[15:55:50] <dabear> Acorn: no
[15:56:01] <Iszak> dabear, don't care
[15:56:04] <Iszak> not for me
[15:56:10] <Acorn> Okay, so onclick it is then right?
[15:56:19] <dabear> (acorn, technically you can in some browsers, but dont do it )
[15:56:41] <dirtycockroach> Oh thats great ajpiano
[15:56:57] <MagBo> http://pastie.org/2024708 — 9th row. i desire to get the list of pairs value -> id in the json format. suggestions?
[15:57:11] <MagBo> ajpiano: it's me with my json again

[15:57:43] <Iszak> ?source
[15:57:50] <Iszak> damn bot
[15:58:12] <Zerxer> bot-t is gone again?
[15:58:21] <dabear> yep
[15:58:21] <dirtycockroach> coldhead Thanks!! Bookmarked
[15:58:23] <Zerxer> he needs a new owner, or running on a dedicated server :(
[15:58:55] <coldhead> Lampoo is still with us, right?
[15:58:56] <coldhead> you?
[15:59:05] <coldhead> bah
[15:59:06] <dabear> Lampoon: you are gay
[15:59:08] <Lampoon> you are a gobshite
[15:59:08] <Lampoon> dabear: Okay.
[15:59:09] <MagBo> ajpiano: sweet jesus? candies for christians lol
[15:59:23] <coldhead> bahahaha
[15:59:33] <ajpiano> MagBo, this would be a lot easier if you had an example of your dom structure, and the data strucutre you want to produce
[15:59:33] <MagBo> Lampoon: sweet jesus
[15:59:36] <ajpiano> this code is .... scary
[15:59:41] <ajpiano> sorry :p
[16:09:48] <MagBo> ajpiano: http://pastie.org/2024745
[16:10:58] <ajpiano> sorry MagBo, i actually am about to get going from here
[16:11:03] <MagBo> so what i need is to pass the list of pairs [<value_from_the_hidden_input, id_of_the_parent_li_element>]
[16:11:16] <MagBo> ajpiano: oh, nvm, it's ok
[16:11:32] <ajpiano> ok
[16:13:24] <MagBo> gentlemen, do you have an idea how to make that guy: http://pastie.org/2024708 having that dom structure: http://pastie.org/2024745 return list of pairs <value_from_the_hidden_input, id_of_the_parent_li_element> for each OL it has?
[16:13:39] <tbranyen> i'm not a gentle man
[16:13:46] <tbranyen> if you know what i mean ;-)
[16:14:07] <MagBo> i want the list in the json form of course
[16:15:06] <MagBo> tbranyen: not that anyone cares, tbh
[16:15:44] <MagBo> if you can help me, i'd appreciate that else — ignore me pls.
[16:16:20] <dabear> MagBo: use .each, construct an array before the .each and append to that inside the loop
[16:17:10] <dabear> var arr = []; arr.push(["foo", "bar"]); arr
[16:17:17] <dabear> ?eval 1
[16:17:46] <GoGoGarrett> Bots on kit-kat break
[16:18:16] <aidan> How can I "reset" the class attribute for an element?
[16:18:31] <aidan> I want it to go back to whatever it was when the document loaded
[16:18:43] <GoSox> does jQuery have the ability to play a sound? i want a simple short sound to play when a form is submitted
[16:18:45] <MagBo> dabear: roger that, will do
[16:19:11] <MagBo> GoSox: even if it can, you'd better have a look at html5
[16:19:13] <Rahly> GoSox, no, but some html5 browsers have <audio /> which can work
[16:19:30] <MagBo> blast, i've just lost the game
[16:19:56] <MagBo> i keep losing the game when smb tells something simultaneously :((
[16:20:00] <Acorn> what's the best way to check a checkbox's check status?
[16:20:12] <GoSox> .checked()
[16:20:13] <dabear> is(":checked")
[16:20:24] <dabear> or .checked on the dom node
[16:20:59] <Rahly> i love me some chinese
[16:21:10] <GoGoGarrett> bbq chinese?
[16:21:31] <Rahly> GoGoGarrett: would be a very interesting night
[16:22:14] <GoSox> but its sunday
[16:22:14] <Rahly> might have to add that command to Klggcrtfm
[16:22:17] <GoSox> sunday = macaroni
[16:22:35] <GoGoGarrett> I'd say. haha I'm halfway through Novice to Ninja. half ninja
[16:22:46] <Rahly> whats that? naruto?
[16:23:03] <GoGoGarrett> jQuery - novice to ninja
[16:23:10] <Rahly> lol it was a joke
[16:23:17] <GoGoGarrett> haha
[16:23:18] <GoGoGarrett> sorry
[16:23:29] <Rahly> half ninja = naruto
[16:23:31] <GoGoGarrett> yeah man, second season
[16:24:38] <GoGoGarrett> I'm sure i'm last to hear about it, but I downloaded alfred today.  Rather sweet app
[16:25:57] <Rahly> donno, don't use mac
[16:26:43] <zoka> anybody fixed beautytips plugin to work with 1.6+ jQuery?
[16:26:58] <Rahly> never heard of the plugin.
[16:27:07] <zoka> I do not see jjeff arround
[16:27:17] <fubhy> Hello! Is it possible to iterate over a selector beginning with the deepest nested element first?
[16:27:20] <zoka> http://plugins.jquery.com/project/bt
[16:27:21] <Rahly> i personally try not to use plugins
[16:27:38] <fubhy> iterating from inner to outer
[16:27:40] <Rahly> lol with that url, it looks like jquery has bittorrent capibilities
[16:27:48] <zoka> Rahly that is nice but this plugin simply do the thing
[16:28:07] <spyvsspy> Im looking to hire someone to track down a jquery bug for me
[16:28:08] <Rahly> do the thing? sounds dangerous
[16:28:16] <spyvsspy> IE related, pm me if anyone is interested
[16:28:52] <Rahly> spyvsspy: that'll be 1 million dollars ~lifts his pinky to his lips~
[16:28:54] <zoka> I hope UI will get 'tooltip' plugin soon
[16:29:06] <spyvsspy> heh, a tad out of my price range
[16:29:09] <GoGoGarrett> Theres a nice one, at jquery tools
[16:29:11] <spyvsspy> i was thinking like 50$
[16:29:11] <spyvsspy> heh
[16:29:15] <Rahly> lol
[16:29:21] <spyvsspy> should take like 20 minutes
[16:29:29] <GoGoGarrett> they offer sample backdrop images - and is called with 1 line of js
[16:29:31] <spyvsspy> i just need a fresh set of eyes, and im burnt outt right now
[16:29:51] <zoka> 50 is fair price having in mind that $6/h is minimal federal wage
[16:30:27] <spyvsspy> actually its 7.25 i think
[16:30:27] <Rahly> for which country?
[16:30:32] <spyvsspy> in the US
[16:30:41] <bittyx-laptop> spyvsspy: is it an actual jquery bug, or a bug in code that uses jquery?
[16:30:47] <zoka> ha just kidding OK I can take a kook for free
[16:31:05] <Rahly> i hate kooks, they are annoying as hell, so you can keep then
[16:31:08] <spyvsspy> I dont know, its a wierd bug
[16:31:35] <spyvsspy> one sec
[16:31:36] <bittyx-laptop> spyvsspy: yeah, anyway, you could've just given a link, most people here will help you for free (that's one of the goals of this channel)
[16:31:45] <bittyx-laptop> spyvsspy: we help because we like to.
[16:32:11] <spyvsspy> ya, time si valuable though
[16:32:21] <zoka> just drop link
[16:32:25] <spyvsspy> and it is behind a login page, and I dont want to blast it out
[16:32:25] <Rahly> send donuts then
[16:32:32] <Rahly> we love donuts
[16:32:41] <zoka> people do it because they do it :D
[16:32:44] <spyvsspy> ill setup a test account
[16:32:50] <spyvsspy> https://qraving.com/admin/
[16:32:55] <bittyx-laptop> anyway, my windows machine is off at the moment, so i won't be able to help (since it's an IE problem), so i'm off to sleep. g'night all.
[16:32:56] <Rahly> well can't you isolate the bug?
[16:33:00] <Rahly> and send a sample?
[16:33:06] <spyvsspy> l: ben@qraving.com
[16:33:10] <spyvsspy> P: tommys
[16:33:29] <spyvsspy> when you click the account settings, or any of the boxes at the top of the page, it doesnt render the php
[16:33:42] <Rahly> i only have ie8, because ie9/ie10s installer won't run on my custom windows
[16:33:55] <spyvsspy> it should display a php page there;  its odd though, because when I replace it with an HTML file it works
[16:34:02] <spyvsspy> its ie 7/8/9
[16:34:29] <Rahly> i'll bet there is a problem with the php, most likely an invalid mimetype
[16:35:21] <Rahly> my boss always fuggers up ajaxing, cuz he forgets the header("Content-Type: application/json");
[16:36:58] <Rahly> i missed reading bash.... http://bash.org/?942220
[16:38:10] <symaxian> Are there any cases where neither the success nor error callback functions are called on jQuery's get/post?
[16:38:39] <Rahly> did the complete callback get fired?
[16:47:11] <spyvsspy> okay
[16:47:13] <spyvsspy> hrmmmm
[16:47:28] <spyvsspy> the html is actually being fed
[16:47:28] <spyvsspy> http://pastebin.com/phLaVP5T
[16:47:40] <spyvsspy> it is just not displaying anything within the box
[16:51:35] <wayne> what's the most difficult part of coding jquery?
[16:51:44] <wayne> i'm guessing cross-browser compatibility
[16:52:14] <GoGoGarrett> I believe jquery does most of that work for ya
[16:54:55] <nonotza> hey I've got a problem with hide/show not working on the page. using this jscript: http://pastebin.com/tmG4Dsj6
[16:54:58] <GoSox> the most difficult part for me is managing all of the id's and classes for everything
[16:55:08] <symaxian> I
[16:55:09] <nonotza> could someone help please?
[16:55:42] <nonotza> the ajax request works, but the image div doesn't change
[16:59:46] <wayne> GoGoGarrett, i meant coding the jquery itself
[17:01:59] <zoka> alert($(this).find('what\s wrong'));
[17:04:27] <fission6> is it possible to inject my own jquery in a page and have it post to a webserive on my local machine, even if the page came from another site?
[17:07:12] <fission6> is it possible to inject my own jquery in a page and have it post to a webserive on my local machine, even if the page came from another site?
[17:07:53] <erichynds> as long as the post isn't via AJAX
[17:21:51] <Rahly> its possible for your own machine, not someone elses
[17:22:03] <Fretta> im using jQuery.ajax and for some odd reason its sending multiple of the same request
[17:22:06] <Rahly> i do it in my ff plugin
[17:22:19] <Rahly> although, ff4 just changed the game
[17:22:36] <Fretta> any idea how to ensure only sending of one request using .ajax
[17:23:12] <Rahly> you must have it in a loop
[17:23:38] <Fretta> hmm
[17:38:44] <amid_hasan> trying to append each of the images into a div. doesnt work: http://jsfiddle.net/forrester/MYNUU/1/
[17:38:46] <turnsour> i'm wondering if anyone can point me to some simple examples, new to jquery, i have a php script that takes a while to output some results (as it is fetching html from remote pages and parsing it) i would like to load each of these results into a text box, one by one, as they come in
[17:39:38] <amid_hasan> turnsour: try pubsubhubub
[17:40:02] <amid_hasan> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5kHx0rGkec
[17:40:07] <amid_hasan> http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/
[17:40:16] <turnsour> hmm, thought that might be overkill for this
[17:40:17] <amid_hasan> Perfect solution for what you're trying to do
[17:40:21] <turnsour> but i'll take a look
[17:41:31] <turnsour> right now, it takes a while for the next page to load while the results are generated, i just thought it would be easier to load each of these results into a text box live on the page, instead of keeping the user waiting, mayber with php's flush()
[17:41:49] <amid_hasan> do you have fiddle?
[17:41:53] <turnsour> fiddle?
[17:41:58] <amid_hasan> jsfiddle.net
[17:42:01] <amid_hasan> post what you have so far
[17:42:06] <turnsour> ah
[17:42:11] <GoGoGarrett> It's returning the entire array for the src, not the specific one
[17:42:26] <GoGoGarrett> perhaps images(i)
[17:42:38] <GoGoGarrett> idk
[17:42:38] <amid_hasan> GoGoGarrett: how do I loop through array, and append to div as an image?
[17:42:39] <Rahly> either that or generate better search information that'll make it faster
[17:42:59] <Rahly> array.forEach(function() { do stuff here }); ?
[17:43:04] <turnsour> amid_hasan, http://webmastered.biz/demo/domain-link-finder/index.php ... press Find Now, you'll see, you have to wait while it does it's job and fetches it result, i thought it would be cool if it could be loaded, one by one, into a box live on the page, instead of waiting.
[17:43:45] <amid_hasan> turnsour: will take a look now
[17:43:46] <turnsour> i'm just trying to learn jQuery with this, it's not a real-world app.
[17:44:01] <Rahly> turnsour, could be done with an ajax, but not with jquery
[17:44:38] <turnsour> Rahly, but jquery *does* ajax? =/
[17:44:56] <Rahly> yes, but it waits until the ajax is completed.  you want to do a progressional load
[17:44:57] <amid_hasan> You're trying to load the results ASa they are found?
[17:45:24] <Rahly> how to plan to show to the users the query is done?
[17:45:41] <turnsour> yes, instead of keeping the user waiting for all of the results at once, i thought it would be cool if they loaded into the box one by one, and that would be a good way for me to learn ajax with jquery, i'm new to it
[17:45:57] <amid_hasan> that sounds like something you need to mitigate via jquery
[17:46:07] <ryanneufeld> turnsour: you can do that for sure
[17:46:10] <Rahly> the only way to do it with jquery is do multiple ajaxes
[17:46:17] <amid_hasan> in reality results will be returned at once, however, on the front end you woudl say make each on appear seperately
[17:46:24] <turnsour> maybe i should start with something more simple lol
[17:46:31] <amid_hasan> $.each(), and fadeIn()
[17:46:36] <ryanneufeld> exactly
[17:46:54] <amid_hasan> Your php script will limit/define total results
[17:47:10] <amid_hasan> you can then use something like .size() in jquery to get total of returned results
[17:47:16] <ryanneufeld> turnsour:  it's a better UX to fade in all the results at once
[17:47:28] <Rahly> thats just visual though... not when they come in
[17:47:33] <amid_hasan> then use that as a parameter and loop through each result showing x seconds after previous one fired
[17:47:48] <amid_hasan> When they come in requires a bit more complicated code
[17:47:51] <turnsour> yeah, thats visual, i want them to come in live, so the user not wait for them all at once like it is now
[17:48:05] <coldhead> would anyone like chocolate cake? i would
[17:48:05] <amid_hasan> pubhubsubbhub
[17:48:16] <symaxian> Whats the easiest way to turn an array into its string representation?
[17:48:24] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: ftw
[17:48:28] <Rahly> Klggcrtfm would be great for this job
[17:48:30] <turnsour> i think i should start with something more simple. like a live search. that would point me in the right direction. and yeah pubshubsubhub looks interesting
[17:48:56] <coldhead> ['foo', 'aids', 99].join(' ') // symaxian
[17:49:13] <GoGoGarrett> You have spare cake?
[17:49:25] <Rahly> i love pumpkin pie
[17:49:46] <ryanneufeld> I like cheese
[17:49:49] <GoGoGarrett> I am a fan of candy, kidnappers.. are my weakness.
[17:50:14] <ryanneufeld> GoGoGarrett: thx for the twitter follow, at least I think it was you
[17:50:19] <Rahly> what about nipple rings?
[17:50:26] <GoGoGarrett> Yeah for sure, I'm following ya :]
[17:50:33] <ryanneufeld> creeper
[17:50:34] <ryanneufeld> lol
[17:50:35] <GoGoGarrett> Thanks for letting me use jo fancybox haha
[17:50:39] <GoGoGarrett> :[
[17:50:54] <ryanneufeld> my fancybox?
[17:51:07] <GoGoGarrett> just kidding
[17:51:16] * ryanneufeld is confused
[17:51:21] <pomke> Is it possible to use jquery ui 'tabs' without using ids on the panels?
[17:51:23] <GoGoGarrett> You helped me intergrating my api's
[17:51:25] * niftylettuce spots a WILD confused ryanneufeld
[17:51:30] <GoGoGarrett> lol
[17:51:32] <GoGoGarrett> Sorry
[17:51:35] <ryanneufeld> haha
[17:51:37] <ryanneufeld> no worries
[17:51:43] <ryanneufeld> glad I helped
[17:51:48] <amid_hasan> Can anyone please explain how to support cross-domain ajax calls?
[17:51:54] <GoGoGarrett> I got it working, I intergrated facebook's api's from an albumn to dymamically populate an image gallery
[17:52:02] <pomke> amid_hasan: google jsonp
[17:52:04] <symaxian> coldhead: I mean convert an array to a string that would eval back into the array
[17:52:12] <Rahly> amid_hasan: you can only do it if you pass it through your domain
[17:52:13] <ryanneufeld> GoGoGarrett: cool, can I see it?
[17:52:19] <GoGoGarrett> and if someone likes or shares they recieve a discount code - I effelt balling
[17:52:30] <amid_hasan> Rahly: how do I pass through my domain?
[17:52:35] <GoGoGarrett> It's not a very pretty design, but I didn't design.. just coded  www.shaichief.com
[17:52:42] <GoGoGarrett> and I'm still a scrub
[17:52:53] <Rahly> write a script thats on your server, when you post to that, it posts to the other domain, and returns you the results
[17:52:57] <amid_hasan> Can I set origin inside the application and authenticate the origin in the remote server script, even though its not on the same domain?
[17:53:15] <Rahly> you can, but origin is not supported by all browsers
[17:53:16] <amid_hasan> The other domain is actually a mobile device
[17:53:17] <pomke> Rahly, amid_hasan: or use jsonp
[17:53:27] <pomke> and not ajax
[17:53:42] <amid_hasan> how would i do jsonp using jquery. example code?
[17:53:42] <ryanneufeld> GoGoGarrett: nice, looks good man
[17:53:50] <ryanneufeld> quick and clean
[17:54:16] <Rahly> jsonp, is insecure and should never be used
[17:54:17] <ryanneufeld> ?jsonp @ amid_hasan
[17:54:33] <ryanneufeld> ?help
[17:54:51] <ryanneufeld> fuck no bot-t
[17:54:56] <GoGoGarrett> Thanks man, It was my first time working with Big Cartel -the stores platform, and It took me awhile to get used to.
[17:54:58] <pomke> amid_hasan: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[17:56:35] <pomke> So anyway, I'd like to use jquery ui tabs, multiple times on the screen (in a dialog, the user might create many dialogs) which makes it hard because from the examples, ui tabs seem to use descrete IDs to link tabs to panels. How can I work around this?
[17:56:39] <amid_hasan> pomke, Rahly: thank you!
[17:56:40] <Rahly> also, if he doesn't have control over the other side, he can't do jsonp
[17:56:45] <pomke> amid_hasan: np
[17:56:56] <amid_hasan> Rahly: i have control over server script
[17:57:15] <ryanneufeld> pomke:  you'll have to code a custom solution
[17:57:20] <amid_hasan> However, the actual "application" is hosted on a mobile device, and depends on an internet connection
[17:57:36] <pomke> ryanneufeld: using .add() ?
[17:57:42] <pomke> ok
[17:57:46] <pomke> I'll poke around
[17:58:16] <Rahly> i don't like the code injection of it all
[17:58:54] <ryanneufeld> pomke: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#manipulation
[17:59:39] <pomke> ryanneufeld: oh, ta :)
[18:00:01] <ryanneufeld> pomke: np, you an aussie?
[18:00:10] <pomke> yes, how did you know?
[18:00:54] <turnsour> anyone tell me why this isn't working correctly? http://pastebin.com/sLd1VxBS i see the "Data Loaded:" part, but no data :-( so 'data' var must be empty. the test.php, simple contains <?php echo 'hello world'; ?> ..so I was expecting, "Data Loaded: hello world" ...where am i going wrong? example lifted right from jquery.com.
[18:01:35] <amid_hasan> does jsonp send data through url key/value pairs?
[18:01:44] <thathurts> turnsour: it's because .get() returns an xmldocument object
[18:01:47] <thathurts> turnsour: not text
[18:02:05] <pomke> amid_hasan: no, it's a json response
[18:02:12] <thathurts> turnsour: try data.text() or something
[18:02:14] <pomke> wrapped in a javascript callback
[18:02:16] <Rahly> "hello world" isn't json
[18:02:19] <Rahly> so its failing
[18:02:28] <turnsour> man i need some kind of debugger, this is why i have avoided javascript my whole life lol not a good start.
[18:02:33] <turnsour> thathurts, thanks ill try that now
[18:02:41] <Rahly> '{"hello":"world"}' would be json
[18:02:56] <pomke> ryanneufeld: how did you know I was an aussie? :)
[18:03:05] <ryanneufeld> pomke: "ta"
[18:03:20] <ryanneufeld> my step mum is an aussie, from SA
[18:03:22] <amid_hasan> so if I post to remote server script, with jsonp callback, the response would be returned in json?
[18:03:27] <Rahly> either an ozzie or a kiwi
[18:03:44] <ryanneufeld> or from South Africa actually
[18:03:54] <pomke> ryanneufeld: aaah :)
[18:04:08] <ryanneufeld> pomke: yeah, I speak a little slang ;)
[18:10:10] <csarven> Does jQuery UI supposed to include jQuery core?
[18:10:18] <Rahly> very carefully
[18:11:40] <csarven> i.e., if jQuery UI is included can jQuery core be skipped?
[18:12:22] <Rahly> no
[18:12:34] <Rahly> on their web site, thats the jquery UI core
[18:15:50] <csarven> Rahly Thanks
[18:22:45] <GoGoGarrett> Nothing better then Puns in books, they crack me up
[18:23:11] <iszak> people.. read.. books?
[18:23:25] <turnsour> ah ha! there is a way to do long polling, with this plugin for example http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ajax-http-stream ..i knew pubsubhubbub would be overkill
[18:23:28] <GoGoGarrett> well, i'm reading jquery tutorial books at the moment, have been all day x.x
[18:23:42] <iszak> wasting your time
[18:24:58] <GoGoGarrett> I've found them rather informative thus far, repetition helps me. Seeing the same idea being hammed on over and over helps it sink in- as well as my own personal practices
[18:26:00] <thathurts> hey
[18:26:02] <iszak> good for you
[18:26:04] <thathurts> what's the best service to host images?
[18:26:09] <thathurts> a free one that just lets you upload
[18:26:15] <GoGoGarrett> photobucket is alright
[18:26:23] <Rahly> flicker?
[18:27:23] <vasocreta> I am having an issue where my .hover() method stops working when dynamic content is dropped into my page. See code: http://jsfiddle.net/vasocreta/7xAHt/1/
[18:27:52] <vasocreta> If I hard code in the content that this code targets, everything works fine
[18:28:04] <vasocreta> anyone else ever experience this?
[18:28:15] <vasocreta> do I need to use .delegate()?
[18:28:31] <iszak> delegate/live, yes.
[18:28:40] <iszak> or simply have a callback which rebinds it.
[18:29:45] <vasocreta> ah, so maybe I can place my hover stuff in as a callback in the cycle script?
[18:30:09] <vasocreta> I was trying to avoid delegate/live
[18:30:26] <iszak> vasocreta, sure!
[18:30:35] <vasocreta> mainly because I am noobish at it :-|
[18:30:48] <vasocreta> thx, iszak. Will give it a go.
[18:35:00] <vasocreta> wow! Talk about major FAIL! Grrr. Time to learn how to use delegate, I think.
[18:35:14] <thathurts> event delegation is really awesome
[18:35:21] <thathurts> once you get it, you'll be using it all the time
[18:35:52] <vasocreta> I hope I get it. my first attempt causes the entire thing to stop working. Not sure how that happens.
[18:37:01] <Rahly> i prefer events for everything myself
[18:37:09] <Rahly> rather than functions
[18:37:26] <Rahly> its just i wish jquery did async events
[18:41:15] <MC_BTay> so i've got these jquery tabs, using ajax, and whenever i click one of them, it scrolls my page up randomly, anybody have any clues?
[18:41:31] <GoGoGarrett> return false
[18:41:41] <GoGoGarrett> perhaps?
[18:43:07] <MC_BTay> would i do that in my javascript func?
[18:43:24] <GoGoGarrett> I believe on the click funciton
[18:43:53] <GoGoGarrett> prevent default /propagation  || return false i believe will fix it but i'm a scrub so who knows
[18:44:07] <MC_BTay> yeah i'm super new to jquery
[18:44:15] <MC_BTay> i'm trying to learn lol, so i have all these strange errors
[18:44:24] <thathurts> MC_BTay: do those tabs have a "#" href?
[18:44:30] <MC_BTay> yes they do!
[18:44:33] <thathurts> that's why
[18:44:37] <thathurts> # will send you back to the top
[18:44:48] <MC_BTay> no way to prevent it?
[18:44:50] <thathurts> replace the href="#" with href="javascript:void(0);" or something
[18:45:06] <MC_BTay> well i mean they're not strictly href="#"'s
[18:45:23] <MC_BTay> they're like href="#home" and stuff
[18:45:38] <jayar> how do i replace an image src with the href src of a link? like $('a').click(function() {
[18:45:44] <MC_BTay> it wasn't doing it earlier :/ but i added ID's to the <li> elements and it started doing it
[18:45:59] <GoGoGarrett> post your code on jsfiddle
[18:46:08] <jayar> do i use $('.imageclass').attr(...?
[18:46:35] <MC_BTay> jsfiddle?
[18:49:29] <MC_BTay> thathurts: so does it do it if there's a # in the href anywhere? or if they href is just #
[18:50:33] <GoGoGarrett> jsfiddle.net it's a cool thing you can copy/paste your code in and share so others can see what you're working win
[18:50:36] <GoGoGarrett> with*
[18:50:50] <MC_BTay> oh god, nobody needs to see my code, it's terrible i'm sure haha
[18:51:01] <GoGoGarrett> haha :P
[18:51:55] <Rahly> is anyone going to watch Grimm this fall?
[18:55:37] <GoGoGarrett> Looks interesting
[18:57:17] <MC_BTay> fixed my problem, must have been something silly
[19:02:44] <MC_BTay> hmmm, now i'm having another interesting problem
[19:02:53] <Rahly> problems problems
[19:02:58] <Rahly> GoGoGarrett: what?
[19:03:06] <MC_BTay> so i've got those jquery tabs, and for each tab, it updates the url to #home, #about, etc...
[19:03:27] <MC_BTay> however when i just go to www.mypage.com/, it hits index, and i can't figure out how to make it go straight to #home
[19:03:41] <GoGoGarrett> that show looks interesting
[19:06:23] <GoGoGarrett> How do you @mention someone in irc
[19:07:44] <MC_BTay> no idea
[19:11:06] <MC_BTay> what's syntax for triggering an event again?
[19:11:06] <coldhead> trigger()
[19:11:06] <ryanneufeld> GoGoGarrett: you just type their name
[19:11:13] <geestring> how do you display the time and have it change it real time? do I need to call the date object using a timer every 1 second?
[19:11:16] <GoGoGarrett> That sounds entirely too easy :P
[19:11:20] <ryanneufeld> most clients just highlight the users name for them
[19:11:26] <ryanneufeld> yeah, it does, doesn't it
[19:11:55] <Rahly> GoGoGarrett: Grimm, Once Upon A Time, Person of Interest, and possibly The River, are the only shows IMO that look interesting next fall
[19:12:19] <GoGoGarrett> Rahly Have you seen dexter?
[19:12:30] <ryanneufeld> OMG Dexter
[19:12:32] <ryanneufeld> such an amazing show
[19:12:37] <GoGoGarrett> I love it
[19:12:46] <GoGoGarrett> It's the perfect - guys - drama, has it all
[19:12:47] <ryanneufeld> any idea of season 6 is happening
[19:12:48] <ryanneufeld> ?
[19:12:53] <GoGoGarrett> I hope so
[19:13:06] <ryanneufeld> I really wish they kept Lumen in the show
[19:13:08] <Rahly> GoGoGarrett: have all the seasons on DVD
[19:13:47] <GoGoGarrett> Yeah, it looks like they have season 6 teasers and supposed confirmations
[19:13:59] <ryanneufeld> oooh, nice
[19:14:16] <GoGoGarrett> Season 1 and Season 4 > others
[19:14:25] <GoGoGarrett> But they're all good
[19:15:20] <GoGoGarrett> I don't get to watch entirely too much Tv, but I'm a big movie buff.
[19:17:09] <ryanneufeld> Season 1, 4, 5 are my favs
[19:18:21] <GoGoGarrett> Yeah, they're pretty sweet. Although Lila in season 2 was pretty cute :P even though she was crazy..
[19:19:41] <devinrolsen> Has anyone seen a CSS parser that will give me a list of just the selectors out of all my provided CSS?
[19:20:20] <ryanneufeld> devinrolsen: there is a firefox plugin that will do that
[19:20:30] <ryanneufeld> shows the rules in use, and the ones not in use
[19:21:22] <devinrolsen> yeah I am aware of that one, trying to parse with JS though, not through a plugin. :\
[19:23:44] <ryanneufeld> firebug does it with JS, maybe you can try that?
[19:25:43] <devinrolsen> yeah, I was down that road already :).. I did just notice however that Dust me selector (the plugin I was referring to) is not compatible with firefox4. Is that the plugin your were referring to as well?
[19:26:07] <ryanneufeld> no
[19:26:29] <ryanneufeld> devinrolsen: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/css-usage/
[19:27:56] <ryanneufeld> ?tell devinrolsen https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/css-usage/
[19:28:09] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: yt?
[19:29:54] <ryanneufeld> anyone know how to make bot-t come back?
[19:31:24] <devinrolsen> cool, I like it! However, how do I keep my scans from re-setting when browsing from page to page. I would like to browse all pages and get a global sense of non-used selectors. Any ideas?
[19:32:05] <ryanneufeld> I haven't found anything like that myself
[19:32:12] <ryanneufeld> I was looking for that for work actually
[19:32:29] <ryanneufeld> then we hired a guy to do nothing but front end (PSD->CSS) and he takes care of all that
[19:32:35] <ryanneufeld> all i have to do now is write php/js
[19:32:42] <ryanneufeld> life's good
[19:33:02] <GoGoGarrett> Man, I want to get to the point,
[19:33:06] <devinrolsen> :) I almost have a bookmarklet script that does exactly that (lets you browse from page to page while keeping a global record).
[19:33:07] <GoGoGarrett> right now i;m that guy
[19:33:29] <devinrolsen> but I keep running into weird expresions in my hand written parse that freak the whole thing out on some sites.
[19:34:34] <GoGoGarrett> I actually saw a job posting today for a jr font in dev, but i'm not sure if I could handle the ajax potion of it  - http://jobs.37signals.com/jobs/9021
[19:34:59] <ryanneufeld> GoGoGarrett: the ajax portion of it is easy
[19:35:13] <GoGoGarrett> I've never messed with it, do you know any refrences online I could look at?
[19:35:13] <ryanneufeld> devinrolsen: what sort of errors?
[19:35:28] <ryanneufeld> the jquery api docs for starters :p
[19:35:37] <GoGoGarrett> roar! that's a horrible idea -brb
[19:36:54] <devinrolsen> some style-sheets that attempt to get parsed have problems removing all comments. Sometimes media quires messes things up throwing expression errors.
[19:37:30] <devinrolsen> its just turning out to be a mess of regex to narrow and $.each over all the selectors.
[19:39:02] <MC_BTay> i'm terrible at CSS
[19:39:17] <MC_BTay> just really started learning yesterday... had a tiny bit of experience, but not much
[19:40:07] <devinrolsen> ryanneufeld http://tinyurl.com/3hzngcl here is an example of where I'm at now.
[19:40:29] <devinrolsen> click the little + icons to add the style sheet and begin listening over all the selectors.
[19:40:39] <devinrolsen> then you can keep browsing the web site as that list gets updated.
[19:40:46] <MC_BTay> wow
[19:41:04] <MC_BTay> you've got a little experience?
[19:41:07] <MC_BTay> :P
[19:41:08] <GoGoGarrett> ryanneufeld: Yeah you're right, it looks pretty straight-forward.
[19:42:12] <devinrolsen> but again, my parser fails on much larger style sheets that have weird comment locations and media quires.
[19:44:03] <ryanseddon> devinrolsen: CSS isn't a regular language so regular expression are going to be hard to use in all cases. http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/removing-comments-in-javascript/
[19:44:24] <Rahly> man, i use setTimeout(f,0); a lot
[19:45:46] <ryanseddon> devinrolsen: that post is javascript related but the concept of stripping comments still applies for CSS
[19:45:57] <devinrolsen> cool, let me give it a try.. I feel like I'm very close to having something working.. but I've had that feeling all day.
[19:46:07] <ryanneufeld> devinrolsen: well, I don't think I can be much help there
[19:49:03] <heatxsink> ryanneufeld: you are very lucky
[19:49:33] <ryanseddon> devinrolsen: would be worth looking at http://glazman.org/JSCSSP/ too
[19:52:12] <GoGoGarrett> is resize relevant with the new media queries?
[19:53:34] <fsareshwala> Hi - if I do dom manipulation, say adding a div with a class, then any click events that I've registered on document ready don't seem to apply to the new div I've inserted
[19:53:40] <fsareshwala> what's the best practice to get around this?
[19:54:01] <fsareshwala> how can I apply any event that I registered on document ready to the new div I've added as well?
[19:54:08] <fsareshwala> should I do it manually?
[19:54:56] <iszak> fsareshwala, up to you
[19:55:02] <iszak> ?delegate @ fsareshwala
[19:55:08] <iszak> sigh
[19:55:30] <iszak> fsareshwala, http://api.jquery.com/delegate/ http://api.jquery.com/delegate/ http://api.jquery.com/live/
[19:55:48] <iszak> there are 2 of your 3 options, the third being bind it upon creation.
[19:55:56] <Replayer> anyone here good with jquery mobile?
[19:56:07] <Replayer> djquery! hows it going?
[19:56:11] <iszak> Replayer, #jquerymobile
[19:56:55] <ryanneufeld> GoGoGarrett: relevant how?
[19:57:38] <GoGoGarrett> Like, why do a conditional if($('body").width() > 900 {   load big big stylesheet)  else run normal
[19:57:49] <GoGoGarrett> when you can just do media queries in css for window dementionn
[19:58:45] <iszak> GoGoGarrett, and then have to support IE with JS? because I don't believe IE8 or below supports media queries
[19:59:40] <iszak> supporting anything under IE9 sucks
[20:00:04] <tbranyen> i support whatever my sites work on
[20:00:04] <fsareshwala> iszak: thanks, i'll take a look into those :)
[20:00:17] <GoGoGarrett> Well I guess if you use modernizer it would fix it without having to hand code it, but Im assuming they're doing something similar
[20:00:37] <iszak> I thought modernizer was just for detection?
[20:00:57] <iszak> so you'd use modernizer for detection and implement a JS solution
[20:01:25] <GoGoGarrett> Gotcha
[20:02:17] <ryanneufeld> modernizer can add an html5 shim as well
[20:02:37] <ryanneufeld> and if you're using resize to load a new style sheet
[20:02:44] <ryanneufeld> you have bigger problems
[20:02:57] <GoGoGarrett> Yeah, I just saw it in the book, and wasn't sure where it was appliciable
[20:06:43] <vasocreta> when I use delegate(), does the method need to be called from within the <body> or can I call it from with in the <head>?
[20:07:24] <vasocreta> all of the examples on the jquery site show it used from within the <body>
[20:09:42] <supertrue> how do I select all links that end in pdf and contain foo/bar? I know I can do one or the other, but can I do both in one selector? $('#id a[href$=.pdf]')
[20:10:18] <GoGoGarrett> can you just do a comma and do both?
[20:11:23] <systemfault> comma would be a OR
[20:12:15] <supertrue> right, I don't want this:  $('a[href$=.pdf]', 'a[href*=foo/bar]')
[20:12:49] <iszak> supertrue, $('#id a[href$=.pdf]').filter('[href*=foo/bar]');
[20:13:01] <iszak> could probably do both in the same selector
[20:13:18] <iszak> [href$=.pdf][href*=foo/bar] did you try that?
[20:13:30] <iszak> I don't see why that wouldn't work
[20:13:55] <iszak> or you could just use your own filter function
[20:14:01] <iszak> $('#id a').filter(fn)
[20:14:50] <supertrue> I didn't try that, because I didn't know it was valid. let me try [href$=.pdf][href*=foo/bar]
[20:22:40] <supertrue> what did I do wrong here?: $(function(){$('#column a[href$=.pdf][href*=/-/]').attr('href', $(this).attr('href') + '?nocdn=1'); });
[20:22:45] <supertrue>  I want to add '?nocdn=1' to selected hrefs, but links are changing to 'undefined?nocdn=1'
[20:28:39] <ryanneufeld> supertrue: can you post your js code to a pastbin/pastie/jsfiddle?
[20:28:52] <supertrue> yes, one sec
[20:29:14] <vasocreta> I am having a bear of a time with this. Can anyone give me a prod in the right direction? http://jsfiddle.net/vasocreta/7xAHt/2/
[20:30:29] <vasocreta> The content that for the slideshow affected by cycle is dynamic. So, for some reason the .hover() does not work as a result.
[20:31:10] <vasocreta> not sure if I have to do that whole first part using delegate in the <body>
[20:36:30] <supertrue> ryanneufeld: http://jsfiddle.net/LHxk4/2/
[20:37:47] <GoGoGarrett> vasocreta: Error:

[20:38:04] <GoGoGarrett> Js lint errors, idk if it's conflicting with anything
[20:38:30] <vasocreta> will check. thx GoGo
[20:41:41] <Rahly> lol i love deconstructing arrays
[20:42:31] <Rahly> var [x,y] = getCursorPos(); // wish everyone supported it
[20:43:55] <Skola> you mean like http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/#destructuring ?
[20:44:22] <Rahly> yeah, its a stolen concept though
[20:44:48] <Skola> yeah, Ashkenash is the first to mention that
[20:44:56] <supertrue> what should I change '$(this)' to to make this work?:    $(function(){$('a').attr('href', $(this).attr('href') + '?bla'); });
[20:45:14] <Rahly> perl has done that since the beginning
[20:45:20] <vasocreta> GoGo: no go. I am back to the drawing board.
[20:46:12] <Skola> supertrue use .each?
[20:46:21] <supertrue> how?
[20:46:23] <Rahly> [arr[0], arr[1]] = [arr[1], arr[0]]; // awesome array swap
[20:46:25] <Skola> read docs
[20:46:37] <Skola> right now the this you're using doesn't refer to any 'a'
[20:47:09] <Rahly> lol and wow, don't have a lot of links, or that'll take a while
[20:47:12] <MagBo> gentlemen, that's the output of console.log(myArray): http://pastie.org/2025540 . I want to transmit it to my web server via $.ajax({ type: 'post', ... as an url-serialized. what can i do to myArray in order to acomplish that?
[20:48:10] <Rahly> i stopped posting variables in my scripts
[20:48:41] <supertrue> skola, so would it be like this?   $(function(){('a').each(function(){ // something })
[20:49:05] <Rahly> well thats a syntax error, but something like that
[20:49:23] <ryanneufeld> supertrue: yes
[20:49:35] <ryanneufeld> .each() is what you need
[20:49:37] <Skola> 'something like that' yep
[20:49:47] <turnsour> how can I stop my form submitting but still use a form and submit button? (i need to use .submit() instead of .click() because the .validator() is based on the form being submitted)
[20:50:04] <ryanneufeld> return false;
[20:50:14] <Rahly> i rarely ever use forms anymore
[20:50:27] <Rahly> .ajax is amazing
[20:51:00] <turnsour> ryanneufeld, thank you! doh.
[20:51:10] <MagBo> .ajax is amazing once one realize how to serialize an array into url string lol
[20:51:16] <luchenbill> any good ajax tuts?
[20:51:19] <MagBo> which brings us to my question :)
[20:51:27] <turnsour> before that is was subbmiting the first time then running as normal the second time. weird.
[20:52:33] <Skola> MagBo on a form?
[20:52:34] <MagBo> luchenbill: in short: ajax means that you fire a POST/GET from the javascript in order to make a remote procedure call and recieve the data w/o refreshing page. that's it.
[20:52:46] <MagBo> Skola: see my original question
[20:52:59] <MagBo> gentlemen, that's the output of console.log(myArray): http://pastie.org/2025540 . I want to transmit it to my web server via $.ajax({ type: 'post', ... as an url-serialized. what can i do to myArray in order to acomplish that?
[20:53:03] <vasocreta> My head is getting closer to wall. http://jsfiddle.net/vasocreta/7xAHt/7/
[20:53:04] <supertrue> skola / ryanneufeld: do I then use $(this) inside the each loop? I am having trouble with this part.  $(function(){('a').each(function(){ $(this).attr('href', $(this).attr('href') + ?bla ); })
[20:53:04] <Rahly> lol you mean like... ajax({ url: url, type: "post", contentType: "application/json", data: JSON.stringify(data), processData: false}); ?
[20:54:04] <luchenbill> wtf is JSON
[20:54:21] <MagBo> troll detected
[20:54:24] <Skola> supertrue
[20:54:25] <luchenbill> not at all
[20:54:29] <luchenbill> ok ...
[20:54:32] <MagBo> tut on ajax. wtf is json :)
[20:54:42] <Skola> you use $(this), yes
[20:54:43] <luchenbill> no I mean Do you know of any good reading for ajax online
[20:54:54] <Skola> $.each($('p'), function() { console.log($(this)); });
[20:54:56] <Skola> for example
[20:55:09] <Rahly> you need to read about ajax?  i'm not sure it can get any more simple
[20:55:11] <MagBo> luchenbill: what do you want to know about ajax?
[20:55:12] <luchenbill> this refers to the object the call is made from?
[20:55:53] <luchenbill> which object was instantiated?
[20:56:21] <Rahly> this can be anything you want it to be
[20:56:43] <luchenbill> huh?
[20:56:46] <MagBo> come on guys, tell me what to do with that array to encode it in the url string http://pastie.org/2025540 ? i was tried to do $(myArray).serialize() with literally no result
[20:56:53] <Rahly> function bob() { };   bob.call(foofoo);   now bob's this = foofoo
[20:56:58] <Skola> magbo
[20:56:59] <Skola> http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[20:57:00] <Skola> ??
[20:57:28] <Skola> or is your array created in a custom fashion? :[
[20:58:00] <MagBo> Skola, keeps feeding me with []
[20:58:03] <MagBo> []'s
[20:58:12] <Rahly> i just realized, i think its been 2 years since i've used a <form>
[20:58:25] <MagBo> my array is most probably was constructed incorrectly
[20:58:35] <Rahly> i had to look up the attributes for it
[20:58:53] <Skola> forms are still nice for RESTful apps
[20:59:48] <MagBo> Skola: http://pastie.org/2025578
[20:59:49] <luchenbill> no I don't think that's right Rahly? wouldn't you need a - class boobs { property one; function function_one() { statements; }; } bob = new boobs; bob.one = blarg;?
[20:59:53] <luchenbill> err
[20:59:54] <Rahly> i guess, its just been a while for me
[20:59:55] <luchenbill> idk
[21:00:00] <luchenbill> shit i'm trying to understand oop right now too
[21:00:14] <MagBo> oop is dead. use erlang
[21:00:15] <Rahly> no cuz if bob has moobs not boobs
[21:00:20] <Rahly> so completely wrong
[21:00:28] <luchenbill> MagBo?
[21:00:30] <MagBo> oop is dead. use multiparadigm stuff like D2
[21:00:51] <vasocreta> funny, how you can tell who is on deadlines here. Ha! I know I am.
[21:01:04] <Rahly> yeah well, js is not oop :P
[21:01:07] <MagBo> oop for oop must be punished by going straight to hell
[21:01:10] <Skola> restate your problem vasocreta
[21:01:22] <luchenbill> oop is dead?
[21:01:26] <luchenbill> I doubt that
[21:01:26] <MagBo> for reals
[21:01:42] <Rahly> i like oop, the problem i have with oop, is usually object creation is slower than moose poop
[21:01:49] <vasocreta> skola: http://jsfiddle.net/vasocreta/7xAHt/8/
[21:02:22] <vasocreta> The content that the cycle plugin affects is dynamically generated. This causes .hover() to stop working.
[21:02:55] <vasocreta> So, I am trying to get the mouseover mouseout events to work.
[21:03:04] <luchenbill> I like oop i'm just very new to it
[21:03:19] <luchenbill> the thing that messes me up is all the public private static
[21:03:27] <luchenbill> encaptulation etc.
[21:03:33] <luchenbill> polymorphysm?
[21:04:03] <Skola> vasocreta
[21:04:08] <vasocreta> here!
[21:04:14] <Skola> slideshowNav is hidden
[21:04:16] <MagBo> that stuff is fundamental. one can't like or dislike oop not understanding those
[21:04:31] <Skola> don't think it can catch mouse events
[21:05:03] <vasocreta> right. I am trying to get slideshowNav to appear when the user rolls over slideshowWrapper
[21:05:37] <Skola> ok you're doing it wrong
[21:05:48] <vasocreta> That is a start.
[21:05:51] <Skola> the delegate is waiting for mouse events on slideshowNav
[21:06:01] <Skola> but it's hidden so it doesn't catch any
[21:06:22] <coldhead> EVERY DAY I TEAR A BIT / FROM MYSELF AND FROM THE ONE I LOVE
[21:06:31] <Skola> how aboutttt
[21:06:38] <Rahly> nipples?
[21:06:39] <Skola> lemme change it 1 sec
[21:06:46] <Skola> ja nipples, was gonna say that
[21:06:54] <vasocreta> Skola, so I changed it: http://jsfiddle.net/vasocreta/7xAHt/9/
[21:06:58] <vasocreta> and that still fails.
[21:07:23] <vasocreta> wait...fadeIn() won't do it, huh?
[21:07:49] <vasocreta> I have to change the display first?
[21:08:11] <Skola> yes fadeIn() doesn't work AFAIK if display is none
[21:08:11] <Tant102> coldhead, sounds kinky.
[21:08:44] <vasocreta> skola, thx. I will try changing display: visible before the fade in
[21:09:06] <pifantastic> vasocreta: fadeIn should work just fine if display: none is set
[21:09:26] <coldhead> THROUGH THE BLACKENED AIR AND ALL / WILL I MEET YOU THIS FAMILIAR WAY
[21:09:27] <vasocreta> pif: Really?
[21:09:41] <pifantastic> ?source fadeIn
[21:09:45] <pifantastic> damn
[21:09:49] <vasocreta> *scratching head*
[21:10:51] <pifantastic> vasocreta: http://jsfiddle.net/uTRLU/
[21:10:55] <MagBo> Skola: fixed my thing
[21:11:13] <Skola> good :[]
[21:11:43] <vasocreta> pif: ok. that is what I have in my code, but no good. Still not working. Something goofy is at play here.
[21:20:46] <vasocreta> ok, so the really weird part about my issue now is that the <ul> changes from display: hidden to display: block (good) but the <li> tags in the <ul> stay hidden!! WTH!!
[21:42:48] <TheColonial> Guys, anyone here know how to fire events when jquery templates are rendered?
[21:44:25] <lutaaa> hey
[21:45:24] <lutaaa> I was wondering is there a way to use window(error) on functions that have been added to jquery?
[21:46:58] <Rahly> should already fire onerror
[21:47:03] <Rahly> unless handled
[21:50:22] <abjorn> HEY
[21:50:25] <abjorn> SUP
[21:50:47] <lutaaa> Rahly: I a trying to catch bugs like so:  $(window).error(function(e){
[21:50:47] <lutaaa>     console.log(e.originalEvent);
[21:50:48] <lutaaa> });
[21:51:14] <abjorn> y
[21:54:33] <Rahly> which should work
[21:54:43] <Rahly> as long as they are not trapped
[21:56:15] <vasocreta> OK now I am REALLY stumped!!!! So long as there are not more than 13 images in my slideshow, the following code works: http://jsfiddle.net/vasocreta/7xAHt/30/
[21:56:27] <vasocreta> this is freaking ridiculous!
[21:56:53] <Superman_> flash builder 4.5 wow :)
[21:56:55] <vasocreta> the part that is breaking, fyi, is the .hover part
[21:57:59] <lutaaa> Rahly: I dont think they are trapped my added function is just: http://pastie.org/2025721
[21:58:23] <d4rklit31> Superman_: HIGH FIVE
[21:58:31] <Superman_> :)
[21:58:33] <d4rklit31> FB4.5 woo
[21:58:37] <d4rklit31> r u flash dev?
[21:58:42] <Superman_> yep
[21:58:47] <d4rklit31> cool
[21:58:50] <d4rklit31> me too
[21:59:42] <lutaaa> Rahly: when i try and run the function in chrome's js console I get an expected ReferenceError but not an  ErrorEvent
[22:16:32] <zoka> $(this).find('[title]').andSelf().each(function() {
[22:16:32] <zoka>           if (!$(this).attr('bt-xTitle')) {
[22:16:32] <zoka>             $(this).attr('bt-xTitle', $(this).attr('title')).attr('title', '');
[22:16:32] <zoka>           }
[22:16:32] <zoka>         });
[22:16:32] <zoka> does anybody have idea why jQuery 1.6+ throw error on line  $(this).attr('bt-xTitle', $(this).attr('title')).attr('title', '');
[22:18:32] <Skola> what error does it throw
[22:19:49] <Skola> and why can't you generate the bt-xTitle in the first place instead of the 'title'?
[22:20:46] <GoSox> so if i wanted to change an image to another image, would I use the .attr() function to change the 'src' attribute, or is there another way to do it?
[22:23:45] <Skola> GoSox why don't you just load all the images you need (with ajax if need be), and show/hide the ones you need?
[22:25:14] <GoSox> changing the src attribute seems to work fine?
[22:26:07] <Skola> it is
[22:26:15] <Skola> only concern is that it isn't cached
[22:26:27] <Skola> might not be a big deal though
[22:26:51] <GoSox> this page is not 'serious'
[22:26:57] <GoSox> good enough is... good enough :P
[22:27:17] <Skola> in that case you're doing it right
[22:27:23] <Skola> : ))
[22:34:44] <GoSox> so i have this hide('slow') call that works well, except it shrinks my DIV off to the left. is there a way I can have it shrink the div centered?
[22:34:59] <GoSox> do i have to put that div in another div to keep it centered?
[22:35:20] <GoSox> yup
[22:35:22] <GoSox> ok nevermind
[22:36:52] <GoSox> Skola: see: http://www.johnmasone.com/tellmeyourtroubles/
[22:37:14] <GoSox> :-D (the gray boxes are going to be replaced with my face, with the appropriate expressions)
[22:37:20] <GoSox> this is why html was invented
[22:37:26] <GoSox> i do declare
[22:38:00] <Skola> haha :D
[22:38:22] <Skola> src change will be fine :p
[22:38:29] <GoSox> yep
[22:38:44] <Skola> hahaha
[22:38:56] <Skola> is this a page for annoying customers?
[22:39:14] <GoSox> no, it's mostly for annoying family
[22:39:19] <Skola> lol
[22:39:28] <Rahly> Lepers and Orphans too?
[22:39:29] <Skola> but is it all working the way it's supposed to now?
[22:39:48] <GoSox> in safari yes. i haven't tested other browsers yet
[22:39:58] <GoSox> i just need to replace the grey boxes with photos of me
[22:40:00] <Skola> works ok in FF & Chrome
[22:40:14] <Rahly> i'm thankful, my browser by default disallowed javascript
[22:40:38] <GoSox> i shutter to think how little web you're going to get if you disable javascript
[22:40:43] <GoSox> as much as i hate it
[22:40:51] <Rahly> most of it
[22:41:04] <Skola> ya it's not that bad
[22:41:10] <Rahly> great news though, i get less and less abusive advertisement
[22:41:24] <Rahly> and i enable it for useful sites, like youtube
[22:41:53] <Skola> useful sites
[22:41:57] <Skola> great example ;D
[22:42:03] <Skola> but I know what you mean
[22:42:23] <GoSox> haaaaaaah
[22:42:28] <GoSox> i disable flash, for that reason
[22:42:34] <GoSox> but javascript takes so little to run
[22:42:38] <Rahly> flash is the devil
[22:42:44] <Rahly> kinda like children are the devil
[22:42:58] <Skola> flash is horrid
[22:43:01] <GoSox> flash has some great uses. the navagation bar on your websites is NOT NOT NOT one of them
[22:43:20] <vasocreta> <vent>js and I are not having a good time together right now. </vent>
[22:43:25] <Rahly> flash has only one useful feature that cannot be replicated easily
[22:43:29] <Skola> still not fixed vaso?
[22:43:37] <Rahly> thats access to the webcam and microphone
[22:43:43] <vasocreta> Skola: sort of yes, definitely no.
[22:44:00] <vasocreta> Everything works UNTIL I have more than 13 slides.
[22:44:04] <Rahly> doesn't help it has its own bastardized version of ECMAScript
[22:44:29] <Rahly> its like a useful tool with out the usefulness
[22:44:44] <amid_hasan> what channels do the fbi troll?
[22:45:03] <Rahly> troll or recruit?
[22:45:12] * GoSox is fbi
[22:45:22] <Rahly> -i
[22:45:40] <Rahly> or maybe for you -f
[22:46:00] <Rahly> jk
[22:46:09] <GoSox> i sure wish affordable 1TB SSD's would hurry up and get here
[22:46:27] <GoSox> every time i have to launch my three windows VM's and the 5 browsers in each of those VMs, its sooooo slooooow
[22:46:31] <Rahly> i use raided 64gb ssds for my os drive
[22:46:39] <amid_hasan> Rahly: either
[22:46:47] <GoSox> i use a single 90 GB SSD for OS & Apps
[22:47:03] <GoSox> but my virtual machines are on my HDD, not my SSD
[22:47:05] <Rahly> apps for me are on another drive
[22:47:12] <Rahly> its one of the reasons i can't install IE9
[22:47:30] <GoSox> i can't install IE9 because (thankfully) it's not available for snow leopard
[22:47:59] <GoSox> my setup is basically everything on the SSD, except my user folder, which is on HDD
[22:48:04] <Rahly> my os drive is readonly for all users except System
[22:48:08] <GoSox> and pretty much everything is in the user folder
[22:48:18] <vasocreta> GoSox: I can't install ANY version of crappIE (thankfully) because I use Linux ;-)
[22:48:38] <GoSox> the last version of IE came with OS X 10.3 i think
[22:48:38] <Rahly> i installed ie on linux
[22:48:40] <GoSox> and it was IE 5
[22:48:43] <GoSox> i think...
[22:48:50] <vasocreta> in wine, right?
[22:48:52] <Rahly> works just fine with wine or in a vm
[22:48:59] <GoSox> and people used it, even though it was horrible even back then
[22:49:16] <vasocreta> I tried the wine approach. It is atrocious.
[22:49:34] <GoSox> yeah i never got anything good working with wine ever
[22:49:37] <Rahly> i have 3 linux boxes in my house, but my main machine is windows.  I like the win7 gui
[22:49:38] <GoSox> i just use vmware
[22:49:47] <vasocreta> I play Eve in wine though. That works pretty darn well
[22:50:02] <GoSox> yeah me too, thats why installed it on my mac 4 years ago under the name leopard :D
[22:50:37] <Rahly> i donno about that
[22:50:48] <Rahly> i do like kde4s gui though
[22:51:13] <Rahly> its just all of my linux boxes are custom builds, with no gui, cuz they are headless
[22:51:24] <Rahly> no point in installing a gui on them
[22:51:47] <neuf> Very good, GNOME is Mexican ProgrammerPower.!!
[22:52:24] <Rahly> gnome has been looking more macish every day
[22:52:45] <vasocreta> I am on the fence with Unity
[22:53:11] <Rahly> I would get a mac, but I have to develop apps for the majority.  Which still use windows
[22:53:21] <neuf> Gnome is GUI Every Country
[22:54:40] <GoSox> Rahly: switch to OS X/iOS dev
[22:55:19] <neuf> IOS Dev Run in PC our Mac?
[22:55:29] <Rahly> lol, we have like maybe 2 clients out ofr 500 that even have a mac, let alone a mac for everyone in their offices
[22:56:07] <neuf> ok
[22:57:01] <vasocreta> My new mantra: Skola is a god.
[22:58:45] <neuf> But IOS Dev is Multiuser...!! Is console our GUI.!!
[22:59:25] <vasocreta> Skola is a god. (just going to repeat that every once in a while)
[22:59:31] <GoSox> wow neuf you're not even coming CLOSE to speaking English
[22:59:38] <neuf> IOS DEV for Mac is AppServer for client
[23:01:13] <neuf> JAja i don´t writting english more good jaja
[23:01:18] <GoSox> So how does one turn the volume up in windows xp?
[23:01:56] <Rahly> i always have my main volume at 100%
[23:02:13] <GoSox> i suspect this VM's volume is turned down
[23:02:15] <Rahly> i much prefer apps to have their own volume control
[23:02:16] <GoSox> how would i check?
[23:02:30] <Rahly> control panel? sound?
[23:02:56] <GoSox> i take it back. sound is on, ie just sucks
[23:05:04] <Rahly> sometimes it swallows too
[23:05:24] <GoSox> wow, that means IE does ONE usefull thing. Thats one more than I thought it did.
[23:06:22] <Rahly> i have to admit though, ie9 is a huge leap for ms to the standard
[23:06:45] <GoSox> MS should abandon IE
[23:07:02] <GoSox> they gain nothing from it
[23:07:06] <Rahly> they are going to the same versioning moz and chrome are doing
[23:07:09] <vasocreta> no they shouldn't! Every group needs and asshole!
[23:07:20] <vasocreta> *an
[23:07:22] <Rahly> ff is going to version 7 this year
[23:07:25] <GoSox> no, you can have a group without an asshole
[23:07:52] <vasocreta> nah. The AL East has the Yankees. The browser world has IE.
[23:07:56] <Skola> Rahly IE is still a joke
[23:08:12] <Skola> as far as html5 spec implementation :o
[23:08:14] <GoSox> AL East has a lot of good teams, and the Orioles.
[23:08:22] <Rahly> we'll see, i do have hopes for ie10, even though, i don't use ie anymore
[23:08:34] <vasocreta> hmmm. seems that joke did not go over well.
[23:08:38] <vasocreta> lol
[23:08:39] <GoSox> my only hopes for IE is that they discontinue it
[23:08:54] <GoSox> its better when you say it in front of people from Maryland
[23:09:07] <vasocreta> they won't. It gives them a legit reason to try and influence the W3C working groups.
[23:09:25] <lazyPower> I hate supporting IE however its made me a better developer for it. It forces me to think about unobtrusifying my code for one, and for two it makes me think "is what i'm doing really required" thats about the only saving grace of it all.
[23:09:56] <Skola> lazyPower I agree somewhat
[23:10:06] <Skola> Chrome and FF let you get away with a lot
[23:10:18] <vasocreta> lazy: it has done that for me too. It also gives me ulsers. Separate style sheets for IE is just plain annoying.
[23:10:48] <lazyPower> that they do. I wrote an admin panel for a scholarship portal last month, and it screams on FF/IE... until the databse grew and the rest api response data caused it to fall flat on its face.
[23:10:49] <Rahly> the only thing is that it bloats your css and javascript, which is why i have that new backend system
[23:11:00] <milosd> hi guys, have a quick question about jquery validate library if anyone has used it extensively before?
[23:11:09] <Skola> just ask
[23:11:17] <blkcat> ^
[23:11:20] <GoSox>  my motto is, as long as it looks right in every other browser, and the page is useable in IE, i'm happy
[23:11:31] <GoSox> IE users are used to looking at crap, so they won't even notice the difference
[23:11:36] <GoSox> (when it comes to CSS)
[23:11:36] <lazyPower> thats why i'm up at 2am on a sunday, working on this "element cloning" code thats causing the browser to scream, light itself on fire, and kill the page.
[23:11:51] <milosd> is there a way to extend the library to allow addition of validation messages after you have setup your rules for a form?
[23:11:55] <Skola> my motto is (for enterprise clients): it needs to look exactly the same, even though it's impossible
[23:12:08] <GoSox> i don't have web clients
[23:12:18] <GoSox> i only work on my own websites
[23:12:35] <Skola> sounds like heaven
[23:12:36] <lazyPower> I dont expect I'll be in the web development business much longer. 3 years has been a good run for me. I'd rather be doing mobile or systems dev.
[23:13:14] <Skola> milosd what do you mean by "after you have setup your rules"
[23:14:02] <lazyPower> someElement: { required, minLen[15] } , <-- if memory serves me correctly fr the "validator" plugin in jquery.
[23:14:13] <Tclp> Hey all, I was wondering if someone could give me a quick hand with a jquery UI 'selectbox' I'm working on .. I can't seem to get the 'drop down' arrow to show up properly ... ? ... http://www.beatthisrate.ca
[23:14:26] <Tclp> err rrather ... http://www.hunterbm.com/btr/
[23:14:58] <milosd> if i already setup my validation (http://jsfiddle.net/QbsDb/) and decide to add more rules, groups and messages afterwords. i need this for some dynamic field adding.
[23:15:00] <gnarf> lazyPower: doesn't look right for me
[23:15:05] <gnarf> i dunno whats right
[23:15:30] <gnarf> someelement: { required: true, minLen: 15 } seems to make more sense than me...
[23:15:52] <Skola> Tclp
[23:16:08] <GoSox> Skola: now I have to go shave so I can take those pics to finish that page :)
[23:16:15] <milosd> gnarf: this is correct for setting up rules initially, but what about adding additional rules down the track?
[23:16:20] <Skola> haha :D
[23:16:22] <Tclp> yeah Skola ?
[23:16:22] <Skola> good luck
[23:16:32] <gnarf> milosd: *shrug* never used validate
[23:16:41] <Skola> you sure the path to the arrow image is correct?
[23:16:45] <gnarf> look at the docs?
[23:17:04] <Skola> because it sorta doesn't load for me
[23:17:19] <milosd> yeah had a look at the docs, it allows me to add rules, but i can't add groups, or vice-versa
[23:17:33] <Skola> I bet the path is incorrect
[23:19:36] <milosd> i had a look at the source (https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/blob/master/jquery.validate.js) but no help in getting what i want.
[23:19:44] <Skola> images/ui-bg_glass_75_e6e6e6_1x400.png doesn't exist
[23:20:30] <Skola> you only have ui-icons_222222_256x240.png and ui-icons_888888_256x240.png available :[]
[23:21:53] <Skola> Tclp amirite?
[23:22:02] <Skola> btw this will fix all you jQuery problems: http://www.dumpert.nl/mediabase/1506241/48f56e40/ja_hallo_.html
[23:22:14] <Tclp> yup you were right ... except it didn't fix the problem
[23:22:59] <Skola> well you know how to fix it now right?
[23:23:03] <vasocreta> Skola is a god. Just sayin' G'nite all.
[23:23:09] <Skola> :[] gnite
[23:29:35] <Tclp> Skola ? .. I'm confused .. no I don't ... ;)
[23:29:58] <Skola> the problem is that a file is missing
[23:30:12] <GoSox> how come every browser that supports border-radius, messes up the matte color on the outside of the curve. it makes the rounding look so amaturish
[23:30:17] <Tclp> no , I said you were right about the file missing (corrected) .. didn't fix the problem
[23:30:35] <Skola> oh right sorry
[23:30:37] <Skola> will check
[23:30:39] <Skola> again
[23:30:54] <Tclp> thanks a bunch .. I've been staring at it for a while .. I don't see anything obvious ...
[23:32:07] <Skola> well
[23:32:14] <Skola> the file you uploaded is blank
[23:32:23] <Skola> http://www.hunterbm.com/btr/images/ui-bg_glass_75_e6e6e6_1x400.png
[23:32:25] <Skola> have a look
[23:33:05] <GoSox> that file is one pixel wide by 400 tall
[23:33:14] <GoSox> not quite blank, but not too far from it
[23:33:16] <Skola> ehm
[23:33:41] <gnarf> its a repeating bg
[23:33:45] <Skola> ja soz
[23:35:23] <Tclp> Skola .. that's not the file that draws the icon ..
[23:35:34] <Tclp> the other two are
[23:36:30] <Tclp> -> <span class="ui-button-icon-primary ui-icon ui-icon-triangle-1-s"> holds the icon
[23:36:58] <Skola> I know, 1 sec
[23:40:05] <Skola> right
[23:40:13] <Skola> Tclp
[23:40:26] <Skola> when you use complete path to the image it works
[23:40:27] <Tclp> ohhh .. your about to sound really smart I can tell :)
[23:40:33] <Skola> hahaha yes
[23:40:44] <Skola> background-image: url("http://www.hunterbm.com/btr/images/ui-icons_888888_256x240.png");
[23:40:48] <Skola> and tadaaa
[23:40:54] <Rahly> problem with base?
[23:40:57] <Tclp> that's weird ? ...
[23:40:58] <Skola> yup
[23:41:22] <Skola> yes problem with base
[23:41:23] <Rahly> what about just /btr/images/ui-icons_888888_256x240.png ? without the domain name?
[23:41:25] <Skola> you use /images
[23:41:29] <Skola> but you can use
[23:41:29] <Skola> background-image: url("/btr/images/ui-icons_888888_256x240.png");
[23:41:33] <Skola> ja that
[23:41:43] <Tclp> frig .. my app switching just messed up
[23:42:11] <Rahly> base?  ../btr/images/ui.png ?
[23:42:44] <Tclp> the file doesn't work locally either (with relative pathing) ... hmmm
[23:43:05] <Skola> what do you mean?
[23:43:10] <Skola> background-image: url("/btr/images/ui-icons_888888_256x240.png"); works
[23:43:20] <Tclp> well you think something like that would be a hosting problem ...
[23:43:29] <Rahly> no, its a base problem
[23:43:38] <Skola> ^
[23:43:47] <Tclp> what does 'base problem' mean ?
[23:43:54] <Rahly> you probably have <base /> set incorrectly, or you have the html file located in a weird spot in relation to the png
[23:44:28] <Tclp> is that a jquery setting ?
[23:44:29] <Rahly> sorry i can't see the code
[23:44:31] <Rahly> no
[23:44:39] <Rahly> its an html setting, or how you have the file on the host
[23:45:14] <Rahly> my boss likes to set <base /> all over the place, and he wonders why his stuff isn't portable
[23:45:15] <Tclp> right .. but even if I open said file locally (no hosting involved) .. it ) ......... OHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[23:45:19] <Tclp> frick!
[23:45:19] <Tclp> nm
[23:45:25] <Tclp> thanks guys
[23:45:30] <Skola> no problem ;p
[23:45:40] <Tclp> it should be ../images....
[23:45:54] <Tclp> (2:45am) ... sigh ... *brain slap*
[23:45:58] <Skola> lol
[23:45:59] <Rahly> ahhh, you must be in /btr/dir ?
[23:46:39] <Rahly> or you can do  <base src="/btr/" /> too, and then use images/ui.png
[23:46:56] <Rahly> but setting base is generally a bad thing, IMO
[23:47:07] <Skola> yes
[23:47:26] <GoGoGarrett_> I'm getting owned by this plugin integration,  I had it working perfectly fine with another plug in, but my client wanted to use this specific one.  But the anythingSlider isn't picking up my selector or it isn't rendering the javascript, any help-or point in right direction?  www.shaichief.com
[23:47:34] <GoSox> i hate updating 6 year old HTML to more modern css heavy html
[23:47:58] <Skola> just rewrite it completely ;p
[23:48:08] <Rahly> i love mod_perl
[23:48:17] <GoSox> i basically am re-writing it
[23:48:27] <GoSox> i'm rewriting it around the blocks of PHP
[23:48:31] <Rahly> PerlMapToStorageHandler is the bomb
[23:48:39] <GoSox> what does it do?
[23:48:52] <Rahly> allows you to translate a url to a file
[23:49:01] <GoSox> what does that mean?
[23:49:39] <Rahly> for example, i have /to/new/bob.php,  still calls /index.php and passes in the script /to/new/bob.php, this allows me to setup a framework around the php scripts
[23:50:11] <Rahly> it also allows me to translate  /js/my.js to /js/my.trident.js or /js/my.v8.js if they exist
[23:50:31] <GoSox> so it's like mod_rewrite?
[23:50:41] <Rahly> but with way more power
[23:51:03] <Rahly> for example, i can access a DB to reroute based on login information
[23:51:32] <Rahly> before it gets to php
[23:51:55] <Rahly> and i love being able to handle uploads correctly
[23:52:11] <GoSox> i have had some issues dealing with php uploads
[23:52:17] <GoSox> sometimes they fail, and then you try again and they work
[23:52:33] <Rahly> yeah php is terrible with uploading
[23:52:38] <GoSox> i like consistency
[23:53:47] <Rahly> now i can set php to have like a 100k upload post size, instead of like 100megs because someone wants to upload bigger files
[23:54:21] <GoSox> at some point soon on one of my sites, i have to write something to allow users to upload avatars, i'm not looking forward to it
[23:54:22] <Rahly> mod_perl handles the 100meg uploads now, but only for certain scripts
[23:54:48] <Rahly> this way, not every script can take down the server
[23:54:51] <GoSox> i have my own blog software where i can upload images to go along with my entries and it works perfectly. I used that exact same code on a 'for sale' page on my site, and it randomly works and doesnt
[23:55:31] <Rahly> i also made a mod_perl handler for allow apache to handle websockets, it was ... interesting
[23:57:43] <Rahly> i do like the concept of all web pages being static .html files, and having ajaxing adding the dynamic content.  This way, the html/js/css files can all be 100% cached
[23:58:55] <GoSox> i slip php into all my stuff, even .js files, even .xml files. So my server's webfolder lives on a ram disk, AND i use a php cacher. its very very fast
[23:59:02] <GoSox> oh and mod_defalte
[23:59:04] <GoSox> deflate
[23:59:37] <juha____> holy kangaroo balls
