[03:29:21] <localh0st> is it possible to replace HTML with html() function on matching element? so let's say I've got <div id="parent"><div id="child"></div></div> , doing $("#parent").html(someHtml); I will replace the content (child) of "parent", is it possible to replace "parent" as well?
[03:40:57] <Cork> localh0st: strictly "no", but there is a .replaceWith() function
[03:41:14] <Cork> localh0st: it doesn't actually replace the object though (it inserts the new object before and then remove the old)
[03:57:19] <localh0st> Cork: thanks :)
[06:14:18] <alexises> Hello, I have a dunny usecase
[06:14:46] <alexises> I have nested dynamic form. So I define inside a callback function another one
[06:15:08] <alexises> my case, I have $( '#foo' + i).keypress(function(e) { alert(i) });
[06:15:46] <alexises> i on selector and i inside the alert is not the same, because between the execution of the callback the parent loop had done his job
[06:16:34] <alexises> so how to pass my counter on the callback
[07:08:40] <FilipNortic> alexises: instead of your id method put a class on all the items you vanna loop over then but a data-value or somthing on the elment
[07:09:02] <FilipNortic> the you can access it by $(this).data("value")
[07:09:10] <FilipNortic> inside the function
[07:38:58] <alexises> FilipNortic: I just check ;) I can provides i on first arg and get it with e.data ;)
[07:39:10] <alexises> dirty but as my code is ^^
[07:40:46] <Cork> alexises: another warning, don't use alert for debugging, it causes the browser to do weird things with events so things might look like it happens in weird order
[07:40:56] <Cork> alexises: so always use console.log for debugging
[07:42:24] <alexises> I know, unfortunently I'm definitively not a developer nor a web developer ;)
[07:44:49] <FilipNortic> well if you wanna thinker with web code getting the console out and start checking dtuff there is a huge help
[07:45:35] <FilipNortic> not just logging, most web devs use it heavily for all sort of things
[07:56:43] <alexises> I know, good tool ^^ I had used it in the past for scripting some stuff from web interface that don't provides proper api ;)
[07:57:24] <alexises> I also do some dev with sf2, but I hate JS. Dev is not my main goal at work :)
[07:57:47] <alexises> I'm a netadmin sysadmin, but thanks for help

[21:53:18] <limpc> howdy.  i have a question about reversing a css animation using jquery.  suppose I have something like this, that uses pure css to transition an effect when a checkbox is clicked.. http://jsfiddle.net/nMNJE/
[21:53:29] <limpc> how do i reverse the action using jquery?
[21:55:31] <shoky> limpc: you check/uncheck it. e.g. $('#button').prop('checked', true/false)
[21:57:20] <limpc> hmm i already have a jquery action bound to .on('change') .. wont that trigger it in a loop?
[21:57:49] <limpc> im displaying a confirmation modal and want to undo the check if they click no in the modal.
[21:58:08] <shoky> limpc: no, checking/unchecking programatically doesn't trigger an event
[21:59:40] <limpc> ah allright thanks
