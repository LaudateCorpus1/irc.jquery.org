[05:37:43] <momomo> Is there some image on the box model for :after and :before elements ?
[05:37:48] <momomo> can't find it online
[05:52:11] <danners> hey i want to combine the results of two ajax requests to call one method. i use when for it. the problem is that both of them require a callback to make it work (cors). if i use one request with a callback it works fine, but not when i use when on the two requests. is there a way to make when work if the requests need callbacks?
[06:14:02] <danners> im dumb, works as expected :P
[06:53:17] <ozette> does jqueyr.cookie.js try to load jquery.js by itself somehow?
[06:55:19] <ozette> i load 4 scripts: require.js, jquery-1.10.2.js, jquery.cookie.js and an init.js
[06:57:12] <ozette> but something in there is trying to load a jquery.js, i can't find out how.. any tips or ways to find out?
[06:59:35] <ozette> all i know is that require.js:34 gives a 404 for GET http://127.0.0.1:2020/scripts/jquery.js
[07:00:44] <ozette> i know something is trying to autoload jquery, because i don't load jquery in that fashion, i do something like /vendor/jquery-1.10.2.js
[07:01:11] <ozette> queries with scripts/ contain only my own scripts
[07:20:44] <LukeAF> hi
[07:21:02] <LukeAF> can anyone here give me a hand with some javascript?
[07:23:14] <ozette> ask your question Luke
[07:23:20] <ozette> and this is jquery fyi
[07:23:47] <LukeAF> oh, it said on the jquery blog that this was used for js support too :P
[07:24:28] <LukeAF> i'm just wondering if there's a way to force the main body of my page to display atop a js element canvas rather than below it on the page
[07:38:30] <ozette> LukeAF: why
[07:41:24] <LukeAF> i want to use a js script to create a randomly generated background on each page load
[07:56:48] <LukeAF> ozette: you there?
[08:01:49] <ozette> LukeAF: ok, but why do you need a canvas element on the background?
[08:02:17] <LukeAF> well i don't, but i'm a js newbie and this script currently saves what it generates as a canvas
[08:02:30] <LukeAF> is there a way i can change it so it saves what it generates to the bg?
[08:04:27] <ozette> you can display the canvas, and show other elements on top of this canvas, you don't need to force anything
[08:04:56] <LukeAF> currently it loads the canvas and then everything else below the canvas
[08:05:37] <ozette> just make sure the elements have the right css properties, e.g. a div by default is block element, and will push the canvas down, or show it under the canvas
[08:06:06] <LukeAF> that doesn't seem to be happening
[08:06:50] <ozette> it think it does, you say the elements are showing up below the canvas
[08:07:20] <LukeAF> the canvas is above everything
[08:07:23] <LukeAF> yeah
[08:07:26] <ozette> try #css if you don't know how to get these elements on top of the canvas
[08:07:43] <LukeAF> i've tried using z-index and that doesn't seem to work for anything
[08:27:42] <FluffyKat> hi - if i get a javascript error how can i display the error message as text on html via jquery?
[08:28:17] <FluffyKat> and possible undo the last change made by user?
[11:54:53] <lambada355>  how change 08/15/2015 to 15/08/2015 http://jsfiddle.net/5769072x/ ?
[12:12:38] <Mr21> lambada355: "08/15/2015".replace(/(\d*)\/(\d*)/ , "$2/$1")
[12:36:09] <Utils> so I have like a TabControl/TabItem set up, made to how I want it but I was wondering about the content. Static content is fairly easy but I'm wondering about event listeners for the tabs content, and specific functions that belong in the content... so if I had a function called Room, i'd like that to handle all the content of the tab
[12:37:06] <Utils> not sure the best way to go about such a thing. I was thinking of being able to pass in a function to the content option of the tabitem creation... and if it is a function then it calls the function whilst passing the tabitem to it
[12:37:33] <Utils> that would work best but ... if i keep it separate then its kinda hard to locate things i'm not sure how i'd go about it.
[13:07:24] <jak2000> how to solve: beforeunload  onmobile devices?
[19:17:16] <DarkSector> Does anyone have any experience with DataTables?
[19:17:38] <DarkSector> I am trying to load data first via html and then via ajax
[19:19:01] <DarkSector> The DataTable initialization doesn't parse initial data, I have 500 rows via html but the dropdown has about 250 as default. So I would like DataTables to parse the html and display only 250 like it would normally
[22:01:59] <Zeranoe> How is it that .load() works when viewing a local file (no server)?
[22:04:03] <slax0r> because you're doing it wrong, somehow
[22:05:57] <Zeranoe> slax0r: It loads the file
[22:07:11] <slax0r> Zeranoe: paste some code, and explain what it does, and what you expect it to do
[22:07:15] <slax0r> use jsfiddle
[22:14:41] <Zeranoe> slax0r: This works https://paste.debian.net/plain/309759 test.txt is in the same folder as index.html
[22:15:07] <slax0r> Zeranoe: and why shouldn't it work?
[22:15:26] <Zeranoe> slax0r: load() is an AJAX command?
[22:15:38] <slax0r> yeah, so?
[22:16:05] <slax0r> when you visit file://some/path/index.html and do .load("./test.txt") it loads file://some/path/test.txt
[22:16:06] <Zeranoe> Doesn't AJAX depend on a web server to work
[22:16:15] <slax0r> file:// is just as much an URL as http:// or https:// are
[22:16:25] <slax0r> no, ajax just needs an url to load something from
[22:16:39] <Zeranoe> interesting
[22:16:51] <slax0r> and here, where you don't need any special things, like posting data, and processing said data, but do a simple GET a file:// url is enough
[22:17:54] <Zeranoe> JS reports a syantax error on the console with the text.txt file. Does it need to be html?
[22:18:05] <slax0r> ajax is nothing more than a visit to an url with specified parameters in the background, so if you can open it with your browser, you can open it with ajax
[22:18:11] <rcyr> slax0r: file:// has limitations... and those are browser specific. That's why you should be running a web server
[22:18:38] <slax0r> Zeranoe: probably needs to be transfered as text/html
[22:19:01] <Zeranoe> slax0r: How could that be done
[22:19:25] <slax0r> rcyr: loading stuff from file:// makes no sense anyway, because then in order for you app to work, people would need to have the app files installed on their computer(and then you would probably hit a bunch of other security issues)
[22:19:41] <slax0r> but the point still stands, you can load files from file:// urls with ajax
[22:19:57] <slax0r> Zeranoe: probably put valid html in the file and rename it to test.html ?
[22:23:02] <Zeranoe> slax0r: Surrounding with <body></body> seems to be enough. cool
[22:41:34] <Zeranoe> slax0r: That seems to lead to very unpredictable results cross broswer
[22:43:28] <slax0r> Zeranoe: why do you even need to run this without a webserver?
[22:44:23] <Zeranoe> slax0r: I don't, I was just seeing why/how/if it works
[22:44:48] <Zeranoe> slax0r: Seems to only work in FF and IE 11. Edge and Chrome block it
[23:20:53] <printForever> how do I get href value from anchor?
[23:21:06] <printForever> $(this).attr('href'); this checks if there is href
[23:21:09] <printForever> not the value
[23:22:16] <rcyr> That returns the value of the href
[23:25:58] <printForever> :/
[23:26:24] <printForever> I'm obviously doing something wrong
[23:27:20] <printForever> I wasn't using it as a var
[23:27:23] <printForever> ok, I get it
