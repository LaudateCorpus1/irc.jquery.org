[00:00:04] <voxel> I would like to load in some json data over ajax (this is some sample data: http://pastebin.com/3Y8g4qCB). I want to be able to iterate over extracting the benchmark name, the name of the languages and then then each data set that appears.
[00:00:27] <voxel> You can assume that this data will always be valid.
[00:00:29] <antgel_> i'm looking to add a sidebar that can be expanded.  i've found http://sideroad.secret.jp/plugins/jQuerySideBar/, is this a recommended approach?
[00:00:50] <voxel> (since I am generating it and it is only for a local thing)
[00:01:15] <eddiemonge> voxel: whats the question?
[00:01:31] <raj> .end() seems like really dirty programming
[00:01:51] <eddiemonge> antgel_: whats wrong with slideDown and slideUp?
[00:02:08] <eddiemonge> raj: its not. how so? seems to make things much cleaner to me
[00:02:42] <cpaq> Is it easy to make a div scroll to the top of the page?
[00:02:46] <raj> instead of having an ordered arrangement of code, it chains it all to one line
[00:02:52] <raj> ordered vertically
[00:02:57] <raj> split by ;
[00:03:01] <eddiemonge> cpaq: window.scrollTo
[00:03:15] <eddiemonge> raj: you can use whitespace to break it up
[00:03:21] <antgel_> eddiemonge: i'm a jquery newbie, so i don't know anything about slideDown / slideUp.  i'm looking for it to be used for a pull-out menu.  i'll check out what you suggest
[00:03:39] <eddiemonge> $("something")
[00:03:40] <eddiemonge>     .doStuff()
[00:03:40] <eddiemonge>     .doMore()
[00:03:42] <cpaq> eddiemonge, $(window).scrollTo('#divIwannaScrollTo'); ?

[00:04:31] <antgel_> eddiemonge: thanks, i have been through there, i just don't retain all the info :)
[00:04:49] <eddiemonge> antgel_: then you should go through it a couple of times
[00:05:10] <antgel_> eddiemonge: for sure, will do, sorry if my question was stupid
[00:05:47] <eddiemonge> antgel_: its not but you should have an understanding of the basics before you try to do stuff more complicated
[00:06:51] <antgel_> eddiemonge: the sort of team that i work in is always under intense pressure.  i usually don't have the luxury of a couple of weeks to learn a tech before i dive in.  so i have to do my best.  usually i do okay but i'm only human :)
[00:08:52] <voxel> eddiemonge: I am very nooby at js, if I grab a json object getJSON, with the data above which was in a dictionary like format. Is there some reserved word for iteration on dicts? Like .items?
[00:09:26] <muzone> Anybody familiar with jQuery on Rails? None of my scripts seem to work. What am I missing? I got gem "jquery-rails" in my Gemfile, as well as "//= require jquery", "//= require jquery_ujs" and "//= require_tree ." in assets/javascripts/store/all.js.
[00:09:30] <muzone> The all.js later served by Rails does include both jQuery and my additional scripts (such as application.js: https://gist.github.com/1971198). Anybody know?
[00:10:11] <eddiemonge> voxel: you should google looping over arrays in javascript
[00:10:18] <dlam> is there a selector to like, get the 1st-8th child <li> elements?
[00:10:33] <dlam> i see theres a nth-selecor...
[00:10:42] <eddiemonge> muzone: that sounds.....wrong
[00:11:11] <eddiemonge> dlam: 1st-8th? why
[00:11:12] <cpaq> can you use javascript methods with jquery?  linke using jquery's selector $('#someelementID').scrollIntoView();
[00:11:44] <eddiemonge> ?lt @ dlam
[00:11:44] <bot-t> dlam, :lt(index): Select all elements at an index less than index within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/lt-selector/
[00:11:47] <dlam> eddiemonge: i have a carousel of rotating profile pictures, and i need to slide all the faces off, and the next sent on
[00:11:49] <dlam> *set
[00:11:55] <eddiemonge> cpaq: jquery IS javascript
[00:11:55] <dlam> oOoOoooo nice
[00:12:14] <eddiemonge> ?get @ cpaq
[00:12:15] <bot-t> cpaq, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[00:12:43] <muzone> eddiemonge: in what way?
[00:13:32] <eddiemonge> ?animate @ dlam
[00:13:32] <bot-t> dlam, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[00:13:57] <eddiemonge> muzone: why is your script combining the jquery into the file. itd be better to use the cdn cache with local fallback
[00:13:59] <voxel> eddiemonge: But it is not an array?
[00:15:59] <muzone> eddiemonge: you mean i can take out (function($){ and })(jQuery);?
[00:16:01] <eddiemonge> JavaScript Object Notation. its like an array with key/value pairs
[00:16:37] <eddiemonge> muzone: i mean its better to use a CDN hosted version of Jquery like Google's as it would likely be cached
[00:16:44] <muzone> ah
[00:17:04] <muzone> well jquery is served via rails so
[00:17:21] <muzone> via the jquery rails gem
[00:17:23] <muzone> so that part is cool i guess?
[00:19:01] <eddiemonge> muzone: why do you need that?
[00:19:30] <muzone> eddiemonge: its the way rails folk normally do it seems
[00:19:46] <muzone> eddiemonge: plus there's some talk about unobtrusive js
[00:20:39] <eddiemonge> muzone: yeah, you dont need rails for that
[00:23:01] <muzone> eddiemonge: cool
[00:23:14] <muzone> eddiemonge: i gues ill just delete my rails app that i spent 5 years building :D
[00:23:24] <eddiemonge> sounds good to m
[00:23:26] <eddiemonge> me
[00:24:00] <sdwrage> Hey all. I am having an issue with Jquery fileupload whereby when I upload one image to my live server, it is showing up on the server with two images. locally this isn't an issue. https://gist.github.com/4ff7f7f2ee8be010b2ee
[00:24:43] <eddiemonge> maybe its because you are using coffeescript?
[00:25:32] <sdwrage> eddiemonge: how does that matter?
[00:26:22] <eddiemonge> probably doesnt. personal preference
[00:27:08] <eddiemonge> never saw the point of it
[00:27:47] <sdwrage> eddiemonge: context switching
[00:27:56] <eddiemonge> ?
[00:28:04] <sdwrage> switching from one language to another
[00:28:31] <sdwrage> anyways don't mind that
[00:28:35] <sdwrage> that wasn't the issue :P
[00:30:13] <tman-> this client gives me a docx file with all these copy edits right before launch (appauling i know) and i'm really tired and don't want to have to regex this in aptana.. i know perl is probably better suited to xform this pastie into the series of markup (p, ul, etc) that i want but can i do it using jquery i wonder?
[00:30:19] <tman-> i suck and regular expressions :(
[00:30:22] <tman-> at*
[00:30:24] <eddiemonge> sdwrage: how does coffeescript help with that?
[00:30:44] <eddiemonge> tman-: thats not what jquery is/for
[00:30:47] <sdwrage> eddiemonge: never mind. again I said not the issue at hand
[00:30:48] <tman-> yea i know
[00:30:52] <eddiemonge> tman-: honestly just use a wysiwg editor
[00:31:22] <tman-> is there a way to port this docx file to markup that i can then xform with js and yank the final output for the contents?
[00:33:35] <eddiemonge> tman-: like i said, just copy it to a wysiwyg
[00:34:22] <tman-> like dw?
[00:34:59] <tman-> ill try wp
[00:35:05] <tman-> see what it does with the buffer.
[00:35:15] <Time2303> That worrying moment when you click 'Send' to send an email and the page doesn't change
[00:43:01] <tman-> eddiemonge: props, spat it into wp wsyiwig, 4 mins of aptana and voila, santized.
[00:43:02] <tman-> thanks man.
[00:43:03] <tman-> <- bed.
[00:45:37] <Narhir> Im trying to use jQuery Lightbox1
[00:45:48] <Narhir> and.. I have newbie question but where should I add this javascript code?:>
[00:47:41] <fotoflo> hmm, strange I have a function myFunc(){  window.setTimeout(myFunc(), 10000); } -- and myFunc appears to be running as fast as the browser can run it (aka not once every 10 seconds) -- any ideas why?
[00:48:17] <eddiemonge> Narhir: like how to include it?
[00:48:34] <Narhir> http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/
[00:48:40] <sente> well that's a weird definition..., fotoflo
[00:48:42] <Narhir> I mean like.. there is <script>
[00:49:04] <Narhir> and Im wandering if this script should be "before" or "after" links to images should it be in body ? or should it be in head
[00:49:07] <eddiemonge> fotoflo: because you are immediately calling it
[00:49:26] <eddiemonge> Narhir: it should be after you include jquery
[00:49:39] <sente> eddiemonge: change it to setTimeout(myFunc,10000)
[00:49:45] <Narhir> so it should be in head right... ?
[00:49:46] <sente> but also, shouldn't your function be... doing something?
[00:49:48] <fotoflo> eddiemonge: do i have to put it in an anon function?
[00:50:02] <eddiemonge> Narhir: did you read the How To Use of that plugin?
[00:50:05] <fotoflo> sente: i simplified all the stuff thats not causing problems out of the question
[00:50:06] <sente> err, rather, change it to setTimeout("myFunc()", 10000)
[00:50:21] <sente> put it in quotes, it'll be evaluated in 10 seconds
[00:50:37] <sente> but if you don't "quote" it then myFunc() will be ran immediately
[00:50:55] <eddiemonge> not if you dont include the parens
[00:51:07] <Narhir> they didnt wrote where to put the <script>
[00:51:10] <eddiemonge> setTimeout(myFunc, 10000) like sente said
[00:51:16] <Narhir> WAIT
[00:51:23] <Narhir> this <script> is that what is in the .js file?
[00:51:25] <eddiemonge> Narhir: have you used javascript before?
[00:51:42] <fotoflo> hmm i put it in an anon function and that worked too
[00:51:44] <Narhir> ofcourseI did
[00:52:22] <Narhir> I mean in this module you have a jquery.js and jquery.lighbox.js and we have also code in <script>
[00:52:28] <Narhir> my question is wher ethis "Script" should go..
[00:52:33] <Narhir> to "HEAD" to a file ? or where
[00:52:50] <fotoflo> why does it want myfunc or "myfunc()" or function(){myfunc()} . but not plain myfunc()?
[00:53:07] <eddiemonge> Narhir: so im guessing you are new to javascript then?
[00:53:08] <fotoflo> eddiemonge, sente: thanks for your help btw
[00:53:15] <skraps> (values.length < 1) why does this always return false, values is a array
[00:53:15] <Narhir> I guess the same
[00:53:18] <skraps> i asked in js
[00:53:30] <eddiemonge> fotoflo: because that calls it immediately instead of passing in the function
[00:53:53] <eddiemonge> skraps: console.log( values ). what does it return?
[00:53:53] <fotoflo> and the other ways all pass in the function?
[00:54:02] <skraps> 0
[00:54:45] <skraps> values.length is 0 , values is '0"
[00:54:57] <skraps> its a array of id numbers
[00:55:21] <eddiemonge> Narhir: http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#js_bottom
[00:55:26] <skraps> so if there is more than 3 members of the array then I need to change a variable in the jason from single to multi
[00:55:30] <skraps> json
[00:55:50] <eddiemonge> fotoflo: myFunc() passes myfunc's return value
[00:56:01] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ skraps
[00:56:02] <bot-t> skraps, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[00:56:04] <fotoflo> eddiemonge: ahhh
[00:56:12] <Narhir> eddiemonge : do you refer to <script> or  to link to scripts ? :/ you still didnt answered my question :/
[00:56:48] <eddiemonge> fotoflo: JS 101. which is why I advocate learning some JS basics before jQuery
[00:56:57] <Narhir> Im jsut gonna go and watch video tutorial -.-
[00:57:10] <eddiemonge> Narhir: you too^^
[00:57:29] <skraps> http://tinkerbin.com/peh7iUiU
[00:57:34] <fotoflo> eddiemonge: and the anonymous function is just an object that gets passed in
[00:57:39] <skraps> i tried but it doesnt work on tinkerbin
[00:59:08] <fotoflo> eddiemonge: 摩石过河
[00:59:12] <Narhir> eddiemonge : ... you could just say... "add <script> in <head>" or dont add <script> in <head> or... <script> should/shouldnt be added in <head> I really didnt asked about much ;D

[01:00:47] <fotoflo> eddiemonge: unfortunately I don't have the luxury of learning jquery and javascript for my own edification....
[01:00:54] <eddiemonge> Narhir: i could also write all your code for you.
[01:01:02] <fotoflo> i am working on something and getting better at JS and JQ at the same time - only choice
[01:01:21] <eddiemonge> fotoflo: pick up an intro book. they dont take long to read
[01:01:47] <Narhir> it was easy question in terms of yes or no, instead you linked me to a page which doesnt have the answer for such a basic question :) but yeah. you "Acted" smart and "cool" ;)
[01:03:18] <k1ng> http://www.jvm-neckar.de/
[01:03:32] <fotoflo> eddiemonge: I've actually read the baby-rhino book (several years ago)
[01:03:37] <k1ng> can anyone tell me what plugin being used for that time line?
[01:03:43] <eddiemonge> Narhir: actually that page answers your question perfectly
[01:04:13] <fotoflo> eddiemonge: but maybe its a good idea to go back and read it again
[01:04:19] <eddiemonge> k1ng: thats an image
[01:04:45] <eddiemonge> fotoflo: http://www.amazon.com/Professional-JavaScript-Developers-Nicholas-Zakas/dp/1118026691/ref=sr_1_13?tag=nczonline-20
[01:04:53] <k1ng> an image?
[01:05:10] <k1ng> eddiemonge, are you kidding?
[01:05:40] <fotoflo> hehe eddiemonge: huh my goal is to build an MVP, get funding and hire developers ;-P
[01:06:00] <fotoflo> mvp is like 80% done
[01:06:18] <eddiemonge> k1ng: did you even look at the source code?
[01:06:32] <eddiemonge> mvp?
[01:06:40] <StevenCodes22> Checkout everyone just finished www.stevencodes.com Need some suggestions
[01:06:46] <fotoflo> minimum viable product
[01:06:50] <k1ng> eddiemonge, yes i am
[01:08:42] <skraps> http://tinkerbin.com/peh7iUiU
[01:08:44] <skraps> i tried but it doesnt work on tinkerbin
[01:09:24] <eddiemonge> skraps: did you read the message i sent you? see ? demo
[01:09:25] <bot-t> skraps, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:09:47] <fotoflo> ok off to the market to get some goodies for dinner
[01:12:57] <skraps> i seen the instruction but the page isnt working
[01:13:13] <skraps> i put a example on the sandbox and it wont load  in the html
[01:13:25] <skraps> I used the onLoad part of the body
[01:13:33] <skraps> to execute the function
[01:14:13] <eddiemonge> why are you using onload?
[01:14:24] <eddiemonge> and jsfiddle seems to be working just fine
[01:14:56] <eddiemonge> ?eval var number[0] = 0; number
[01:14:57] <bot-t> eddiemonge: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[01:15:09] <eddiemonge> what do you think this line does: var number[0] = 0;
[01:15:33] <skraps> sets the first array elemetn to zero
[01:16:54] <skraps> the code im working on is a few hundrend lines, of js, a few hundrend of php, then I have magento in it, along with paypal, and then also godadddy, api, i dont know how to repduce the exact thing on jsfiddle
[01:16:59] <skraps> sorry
[01:17:13] <skraps> im trying, iv only been messing with this js stuff for 2 days
[01:17:44] <eddiemonge> var number = [0];
[01:18:11] <eddiemonge> wow just mention all the worst things to work with
[01:18:23] <eddiemonge> paypal, magento, godaddy
[01:18:56] <skraps> after a couple hundrend lines of js I really am beginning to hate then I have to style everything also, Does every developer do server installation, js,php,jquery,json,mysql, its getting daughnting, im sorry eddie
[01:19:14] <eddiemonge> yeah a lot do
[01:19:46] <eddiemonge> but its much more enjoyable when you dont have to do backend/frontend/dba and architecture
[01:20:41] <skraps> i got the domains to check and everything to use json to pass information now, Im just working out a few bugfs, now I have to get it to create the products dynamicly, then get the ipn, then use godaddy api to purchase, and I need a seperate database table just for the paypal ipn tracking, Im using magento for user accounts and order tracking
[01:22:54] <antgel_> why is .ui-icon in jquery ui set to display: block by default?  if i want a button or icon to appear on the same line as some text, how is that a Bad Thing?  i'can override it in CSS but would like to know as i assume it was done for a reason
[01:23:39] <acidjazz> you keep quiet
[01:23:45] <skraps> I I still need to properly style everything, right now, it just allows the person to enter a domain and select tlds, then ajax for the response of what domains are available, , then process selected domains into another json and send it to the mageAdd.php script to create new products in the sopping cart so they can checkout, then after I recieive a ipn do thru the godaddy stuff, But the domain app is almost complete it will be down
[01:23:46] <skraps>  to backend stuff with mage, paypal, and godaddy
[01:25:50] <skraps> I totally retro fitted a php whois script to be ajax json ready, i'm kinda proud at how far iv come so far, but i still see a couple of days untill i complete it
[01:26:50] <skraps> so guy on SL wanted a domain checking script, so I gave him one, but he wasnt sure what he wanted and stuff, but it was part of a project I was already working on, so I figured I would just write the same thing the way I would want it to work.
[01:27:08] <eddiemonge> antgel_: its so its the icon can use background image
[01:27:55] <skraps> I want to use ISPConfig to create a shared webserver and this would be part of the website, select your package, buy a domain if need be, then
[01:29:28] <skraps> process the order and create the person a account on the server, using some sort of queue system in the database, so I can have another set of scripts running as a administrator creating accounts, and email creds
[01:37:49] <ParadoxQuine> quick q: i have a div and another div inside it (to vertically center some text) - i operate on the events in the outer div by letting them bubble up and checking the target, but clicking the text inside the inner one is obviously not bubbling up with the same target. how can i get click-through or get them to act as the same target?
[01:55:27] <Log1x> http://privatepaste.com/26bc2b5873 im doing a little nav script, is there a way i can do like an if statement so if it has the class Active it wont do the mouseover/mouseout function D: otherwise id have to make a class for things that aren't active and that seems blah
[02:11:35] <ParadoxQuine> anyone here? curious about a good way to make clicks fall through a div to its parent div
[02:25:04] <jrockjiggz> ParadoxQuine: why not $('#parent, #child').click() ?
[02:25:34] <ParadoxQuine> when the child element's event bubbles up, the target wont have the data that i need to get out of it
[02:26:17] <ParadoxQuine> right now i have a nice unified handler for all events from this class, no matter where on the page they appear, cuz it all bubbles up to the document quite quickly
[02:26:53] <ParadoxQuine> so i'm trying to put labels on them with positioned child divs without also adding logic if possible
[02:27:31] <jrockjiggz> i think making a jsfiddle would help a lot
[02:28:00] <jrockjiggz> i can't think of a way..
[02:28:20] <jrockjiggz> unless you make a seperate click handler and get the data accordingly
[02:47:08] <Shambat> if I'm using a bunch of jQ plugins, but want to reduce the amount of js scripts to load, for performance ... what is the best solution?
[02:52:34] <bla> Shambat, merging them into one file will reduce number of requests to your server
[02:52:56] <bla> Shambat, other than that - you shouldn't notice real difference. JSs are cached in the browser once loaded.
[02:53:23] <Shambat> bla, ok ... getting poor  result in YSlow cause of it :)
[02:57:32] <ParadoxQuine> jrockjiggz: i think im just gonna go with a click handler for the child divs in there, have thtem stop propagation, then trigger their parent's click event so things bubble correctly
[02:57:43] <ParadoxQuine> thx tho
[03:11:23] <__composern> is there any option fixed coloum for jquery flexigrid plugin ?

[03:55:04] <adam007> http://pastebin.com/thdS8hgH my script
[03:55:27] <adam007> i wanatt image black and white
[03:56:19] <bla> And exactly what is the problem?
[03:56:30] <adam007> and after i hover they will go color,, but i want after i click i want they color permanent
[03:57:25] <adam007> i still already add .click .dblclick but after i unhover they back to the black white
[03:58:15] <bla> Hm. I'd create some container (.item is fine) put there two images positioned relatively (one over another)
[03:58:38] <bla> Then fadeIn/fadeOut would swap them. And of course to keep it permament you'd have to hide one.
[03:59:06] <bla> You're not using :hover in CSS which I guess is good, as JS should do the whole job...
[03:59:40] <bla> Create some variable to mark that the .item was clicked and if the variable is set disable mouseover/mouseout functions?
[04:00:07] <adam007> i like use css, but how to do click function in css :-s
[04:00:18] <bla> Why in CSS?
[04:00:35] <bla> $('.item').click(function()  { ... your content ... });
[04:01:23] <bla> And this click would probably just do $('.blackwhite', this).hide(); $('.color', this).show(); $(this).addClass('disable-hover');
[04:01:30] <adam007> how about multiple image ? i must add another css code ?
[04:01:37] <bla> Nah.
[04:01:46] <bla> (And whay css?)
[04:04:39] <adam007> wait im test :D
[04:04:50] <adam007> thanks for your time and mind
[04:07:04] <SoulRaven> any one use this plugin: http://www.marghoobsuleman.com/jquery-image-dropdown
[04:07:08] <SoulRaven> ?
[04:11:29] <slashwalker> hi
[04:11:59] <slashwalker> I'm just playing around with tabs()
[04:12:21] <slashwalker> now I want to have regular links within my tabs
[04:12:41] <slashwalker>  at the moment all links link to #fragment-id
[04:12:58] <tapas> hi
[04:13:01] <tapas> what am i misssing: i set focusable="true" in my canvas element and then on mousemove: $('#graphics-canvas')[0].focus();
[04:13:02] <slashwalker> and when clicked switch to the tab
[04:13:05] <tapas> but my keydown() and keyup() handlers are never called..
[04:13:25] <tapas> same with $('#graphics-canvas').focus()
[04:13:42] <batmanbond3d> I am using jqgrid and I am wondering if there is a way to do a custom field with more than one input control
[04:13:51] <slashwalker> but if I replace #fragment with an url it tries to load the content of the url into the tab
[04:15:02] <batmanbond3d> I haven't seen even one example on how to do it
[04:16:43] <batmanbond3d> or has anyone here ever used some kind of grid display that supports CRUD operations?
[04:18:40] <tapas> ah adding a tabindex made the magic happen :D
[04:24:45] <slashwalker> hmm <a href="#fragment-id" onclick="window.location.href='http://www.example.org'">Example</a> works, but isn't the best choice
[04:28:24] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to put some image in a dropdown element?
[04:28:24] <SoulRaven> http://jsfiddle.net/umSf4/
[04:31:15] <batmanbond3d> I don't think it is possible to put there are libraries out there that emulate a dropdown where you can put images in
[04:31:24] <batmanbond3d> not too hard to build your own too
[04:32:08] <SoulRaven> batmanbond3d: i have try this, but is not working just fine, when the images are more that 32px
[04:32:09] <SoulRaven> http://www.marghoobsuleman.com/mywork/jcomponents/image-dropdown/samples/cssSprite.html
[04:32:43] <adam007> batman,, can you help me ??
[04:33:34] <batmanbond3d> SoulRaven: that looks like a good example
[04:33:48] <batmanbond3d> adam007: with what?
[04:37:00] <adam007> http://jsfiddle.net/stP3B/ i have this script and i want when i click they will go to the hover image permanent
[04:38:19] <batmanbond3d> Sorry I don't understand
[04:38:45] <NoReGreT> i'm dynamically adding an element, and its click event is not being handled, how can I fix that ?
[04:39:47] <batmanbond3d> NoReGreT: not all controls have a click event
[04:40:13] <adam007> i have image1, and when i hover image1 will go to image2. after i click image2 will appear permnently
[04:41:30] <slashwalker> http://jsfiddle.net/78MNL/1/
[04:42:07] <slashwalker> i wan to link the headlines example 1-4 to external urls
[04:42:38] <slashwalker> but not using a secon a href
[04:43:06] <batmanbond3d> adam007: When you say image1 go to image2 do you mean the image contents will change?  Or do you mean image 1 html element will physically move its X position to image 2?
[04:45:39] <adam007> image1 will change to image2
[04:50:36] <NoReGreT> batmanbond3d: i meant that I have set up a click event for an element, and it works fine. But when i add this same element again dynamically, the click event isn't effective
[04:51:30] <JillesCode> NoReGreT use pastebin or something for a sec, I can help
[04:53:40] <batmanbond3d> NoReGreT: you need to rebind the click event after rendering
[04:54:23] <NoReGreT> JillesCode: http://pastie.org/3518156
[04:54:53] <NoReGreT> batmanbond3d: using bind() ?
[04:55:06] <batmanbond3d> or .click(function() {})
[04:55:34] <NoReGreT> that would redundant to write the same code again...
[04:55:46] <batmanbond3d> $('yourAwsomeselectorthatselectsallelements').click(function() {})
[04:56:44] <batmanbond3d> I agree with you, but you need to render your element and then bind your events like click, that is just how it is
[04:57:30] <batmanbond3d> if you bind and then render, doesn't work
[04:57:33] <NoReGreT> I remember that the old .live() did that ?
[04:58:03] <NoReGreT> batmanbond3d: the thing is I have that element which is generated from php and then i dynamically create it again in JS
[05:00:43] <NoReGreT> so the only solution is redundancy and clutter.. :(
[05:01:17] <batmanbond3d> hmm, never knew about the .on function
[05:01:38] <NoReGreT> JillesCode: any ideas ?
[05:05:17] <batmanbond3d> I don't think .on registers to events of controls that are not yet renders after reading the doc
[05:06:30] <bla> What's wrong with .live in this setup?
[05:06:31] <skim1776> hello there, is it possible to get all elements with the given class inside some div(named question)?
[05:06:57] <bla> skim1776, eh, like select them? div#divid .class ?
[05:07:09] <NoReGreT> bla: it's deprecated, so i won't use it
[05:07:27] <skim1776> bla, I'm trying to use $('.classname', $(div)) but it returns nothing
[05:08:38] <bla> skim1776, better try 'div .classname' or 'div > .classname' for more direct relation
[05:09:57] <deni> hi there...
[05:10:04] <bla> NoReGreT, so what's wrong with .on, then? It seems to do the job. selector is used for filtering.
[05:10:25] <sean`> HI THERE
[05:10:31] <bla> NoReGreT, you should bind on to something 'basic' which was already rendered - table tbody for example. And you can filter the elements not yet rendered.
[05:10:49] <sean`> bla, .live is gonna be rmeoved eventually
[05:10:55] <bla> NoReGreT, to make it work like .live - use someting like $('body').on('click', 'a', cb)
[05:11:01] <sean`> .on and .off, offer both functionality of live, delegate and bind
[05:11:07] <bla> NoReGreT, if I'm not mistaken of course.
[05:11:07] <deni> if i set up a click function that binds with all elemnts of class="a" and that on click it changes the class to b...and at the same time bind a click function on class b so that i chages the class on clik to a
[05:11:10] <sean`> and die, undelegate, unbind
[05:11:32] <deni> how come everytime i click on the button the both functions get executed
[05:11:40] <deni> a changes to b and than from b to a
[05:11:44] <deni> with a single click
[05:11:49] <sean`> deni, jsfiddle
[05:11:54] <skim1776> so the second argument in the $('.classname', $(scope)) is a scope?
[05:12:09] <deni> sean`: what do you mean?
[05:12:13] <bla> $('.a').click(func) <- this will select your element and bind event TO IT. The class doesn't matter latter deni.
[05:12:15] <sean`> skim1776, yes, by default it's document
[05:12:19] <sean`> deni, set up a fiddle on jsfiddle.net
[05:12:28] <sean`> and yes, what bla said
[05:12:46] <sean`> There's a difference between binding to a element using a selector and ibnding to a selector using a delegation approach
[05:13:06] <deni> sean`: http://pastebin.com/9qvkS4Q9
[05:13:29] <sean`> deni, the answer has been given by both bla and myself
[05:14:03] <deni> sean`: sorry but can you clarify?
[05:14:14] <deni> did you look at the pastebin i gave?
[05:14:22] <bla> Ech. ;)
[05:14:46] <bla> Eh* I'm never sure how to *sigh* in English. ;p
[05:16:52] <deni> regardless..i've read about the difference between the bind, live, and delegate methods
[05:16:55] <sean`> deni, yes I did
[05:16:58] <deni> and i fail to see how that helps me here
[05:17:12] <sean`> well.. first tep is admitting you failed
[05:17:38] <deni> sean`: there is no doubt of that :D
[05:17:49] <sean`> deni,
[05:17:52] <sean`> try this
[05:18:24] <sean`> $(document).on ('click', '.a', function () { console.log ('clicked .a element'); });
[05:18:30] <sean`> $(document).on ('click', '.b', function () { console.log ('clicked .b element'); });
[05:18:33] <sean`> and see the magic happend
[05:18:34] <sean`> -d
[05:19:02] <sean`> it's wiser not to bind to document, but to something that's more of a general container, like 'form' or 'table' or #container
[05:19:16] <deni> sean`: tnx... this will help
[05:19:18] <skim1776> what if the element with the class 'classname' is not a strict child of the div 'parentdiv'? will $('.classname', $(parentdiv)) return them also?
[05:19:42] <sean`> skim1776, what are you looking for
[05:19:50] <Zyrte-> Please, can you click , on my link : http://www.claimfans.com/ref.php?id=51647
[05:20:18] <skim1776> sean', I have one div question, it contains div variants which contains a lot of divs with classname 'variant_entity'
[05:20:44] <sean`> is question a tagname?
[05:20:52] <skim1776> <div class='question'><div class='variants><div class='variant_entity /> <div class='variant_entity ... /></div></div>
[05:20:57] <sean`> we're all developers, so I think I'll get it when yo uuse .question
[05:20:58] <sean`> or #question
[05:21:08] <sean`> and just make up that it's an element with an id or class
[05:21:19] <skim1776> and I need to get all of the variant_entity divs into array
[05:21:31] <sean`> var $question = $('.question');
[05:21:40] <sean`> $question.find ('.variant_entity');
[05:21:51] <skim1776> what I do is $('.variant_entity', $('.variants', $('.question')))
[05:21:56] <sean`> WHAT DA FUCK
[05:22:09] <sean`> that makes no sense at all
[05:22:10] <sean`> :p
[05:22:25] <sean`> you can just use $('.question .variants .variant_entity')
[05:22:34] <sean`> skim1776, you can ue the same selectors as in CSS
[05:22:50] <skim1776> sean, thanks, I'll try it
[05:23:18] <sean`> skim1776, if you desire any more help I recommend you set up a jsfiddle
[05:25:32] <deni> sean`: i think i found the culprit.... it can't match a class that has spaces...for instance class="btn btn-success"
[05:25:51] <sean`> deni, those are two classes not 1 class
[05:26:02] <sean`> if you want to match that you use .btn.btn-success or .btn or .btn-success
[05:26:14] <deni> sean`: ok tnx
[05:26:40] <deni> sean`: the debug console really helped.... thanks again
[05:26:48] <sean`> koole bro
[05:51:33] <eskihoe> http://jsfiddle.net/UhnbZ/
[05:51:56] <eskihoe> Help... lol. I have it where on change of event, that it posts to data.php.. but nothing is happening.. fail?
[05:53:20] <miket3> eskihoe, you need to add id="box1"
[05:53:34] <eskihoe> uh where?
[05:53:34] <miket3> you only have name = "box1"
[05:53:44] <miket3> in your select tag
[05:54:11] <eskihoe> I had both.
[05:54:14] <eskihoe> let me try it.
[05:54:17] <miket3> in jquery  # = id   . = class
[05:54:32] <eskihoe> yeah, nothing.
[05:54:43] <eskihoe> I had it there, but didn't know if there was any conflicts.
[05:54:56] <eskihoe> changed it back.. still.. nothing :'(
[05:56:22] <eskihoe> hmm, in dreamweaver, in "liveview" I can get a simple echo statement out of the data.php
[05:56:33] <eskihoe> but when i Load it in the browser and change selections, nothing.
[05:56:40] <eskihoe> firefox..
[05:56:46] <miket3> eskihoe, i debug by using an alert to see where jquery code fAIls
[05:56:59] <miket3> you might have siimple syntax erro
[05:58:55] <eskihoe> well, in this liveview.. in dreamweaver.. It's showing that $box is undefined.. I have this.. $box = $_POST['box1']
[05:59:03] <eskihoe> ;
[06:00:23] <miket3> eskihoe, you are posting box not box1
[06:00:33] <eskihoe> I see that, fixed
[06:00:36] <eskihoe> still an issue..lol
[06:00:44] <eskihoe> *pulls hair*
[06:01:19] <miket3> are you getting value to data.php?
[06:02:44] <eskihoe> Ah, well I think it might actually be my php ini
[06:02:49] <eskihoe> just recently installed this
[06:02:53] <NoReGreT> bla: why would I bind on a basic element ? i want a certain element to be clicked... and not its parent for example..
[06:03:06] <eskihoe> how do I make $_POST available instead of $_HTTP_POST_VARs
[06:04:08] <miket3> eskihoe, beyond my skill set
[06:04:43] <bla> NoReGreT, go read on .delegate, and .on; it generally does what you want.
[06:05:10] <eskihoe> So no, its not passing anything to data.php
[06:05:16] <eskihoe> not in the browser, anyhow
[06:05:37] <eskihoe> browser isnt liking it at all
[06:06:16] <eskihoe> I did a statement... if(!isset($_POST['box']){ echo "no"; }
[06:06:26] <miket3> eskihoe, $HTTP* was deprecated way long ago
[06:06:28] <eskihoe> and yeah.. post box isnt even passing through
[06:07:16] <miket3> eskihoe, put an alert() before jquery $post
[06:07:43] <miket3> is data.php even getting called?
[06:08:45] <eskihoe> the alert is showing.
[06:09:19] <miket3> and your echos are showing from data.php?
[06:10:30] <adam007> any body in here can help me ? im new in jquery
[06:10:34] <miket3> if so simplify your post by removing the callback
[06:10:58] <miket3> adjust ask
[06:11:06] <miket3> adam007, just ask
[06:12:03] <eskihoe> in my browser, nothing is changing
[06:12:53] <eskihoe> yet, if i access data.php directly, it'll just say shit like its supposed to
[06:13:15] <eskihoe> let me do some port forwarding sec
[06:13:50] <adam007> @miket3: i have 3 image,, each image have bw and color, i want when i hover the image go to color, and after i click and unhover they will go to color permanent without hover

[07:12:42] <SoulRaven> if i do .removeClass() all the classed are moved
[07:12:52] <SoulRaven> ^classes
[07:13:01] <Transcended> .removeClass('.className') I thought?
[07:13:21] <Transcended> <--- not sure though
[07:13:31] <RandalSchwartz> no dot
[07:13:36] <RandalSchwartz> .removeClass('className')

[07:19:49] <Molfar> hi. how can I in jquery 1.3 make $.param working ad it works in jquery > 1.4?
[07:20:06] <RandalSchwartz> upgrade to 1.4 :)
[07:20:24] <RandalSchwartz> better yet, 1.7.1
[07:20:35] <RandalSchwartz> it's not like you have to pay a license fee
[07:21:02] <Molfar> Its impossible, because it is built-in in drupal 6
[07:21:40] <LucaS05> hey RandalSchw can you help me with slideToggle?
[07:23:30] <RandalSchwartz> isn't drupal 7 out?
[07:23:55] <RandalSchwartz> LucaS05 - no
[07:24:06] <RandalSchwartz> yeah - upgrade to drupal 7.12 :)
[07:27:17] <Molfar> I have to use drupal 6 at this project
[07:27:30] <RandalSchwartz> why?
[07:27:47] <Molfar> and even jquery_update module updates only to 1.3
[07:28:01] <Molfar> because I'm making a port of module to D6
[07:28:17] <RandalSchwartz> still why
[07:28:53] <RandalSchwartz> drupal 7 has been out for over a year
[07:29:03] <Molfar> many old sites are using D6 and arent going to upgrade
[07:29:28] <Molfar> I'm making a module for old working sites, and they are at D6
[07:29:31] <RandalSchwartz> well - I guess you're digging your own hole then.
[07:29:44] <RandalSchwartz> good luck with that
[07:29:48] <Molfar> thanks
[07:34:02] <Molfar> but may be somebody knows how to emulate $.param() from jquery > 1.4?
[07:34:49] <davidd`> what's the best thing to use for sorting and pagination these days?
[07:35:46] <RandalSchwartz> you mean like datatables.net ?
[07:35:52] <RandalSchwartz> I've been very happy with that for a customer.
[07:36:32] <davidd`> oh cool
[07:36:33] <davidd`> thanks

[07:37:00] <deni> i fail to get the damn thing to change the classes of an element
[07:37:12] <deni> everything else works fine
[07:38:19] <NoReGreT> does'nt the hover event work in .on() ? i tried here http://pastie.org/3519175 and the event isn't triggered
[07:42:07] <xec> NoReGreT: there is no hover event, .hover() is shorthand for mouseenter and mouseleave
[07:42:35] <xec> ?hover @ NoReGreT
[07:42:35] <bot-t1> NoReGreT, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[07:48:20] <znow> im using jCarouselLite plugin - im getting an unexpected error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'offsetWidth' of undefined " which is located in jCarouselLite - how can I further debug this or get rid of it? since it breaks the sliders on my site ?
[07:49:18] <xec> znow: maybe a selector is failing? do you have a live url?
[07:50:49] <znow> xec: I havent updated the live url, all though I can send you a screenshot, so you can see whats failing - http://imgur.com/scCkw
[07:51:48] <znow> xec: it broke as soon as I started using nested_form (gem for ruby) with loads a js file
[07:52:16] <xec> znow: okay, what does that do?
[07:52:42] <znow> xec: it enables to dynamically add more fields in a form
[07:52:46] <znow> nothing els
[07:52:48] <znow> else*
[07:55:13] <xec> well, if it's breaking your slider i would assume it does *something* else ;)
[07:56:02] <znow> xec: hmm yeah apparently... what can I do to give you more ressources?
[07:56:11] <xec> live url
[07:56:23] <xec> znow: screenshot is quite useless, but you do have a stacktrace - maybe the calling code can give a clue
[07:56:31] <znow> xec: just saw that jcarousellite wasnt added in my app file... so I added it but no change... okay Ill just deploy new code
[07:57:13] <Tomashe> how can i send an input array using $.post
[07:57:14] <Tomashe> ?
[07:58:08] <xec> Tomashe: what is an "input array"?
[07:59:05] <Tomashe> lets say i got checkbox name="check[]"
[08:00:04] <Tomashe> i wannt to pass all checkbox :checked WITH $.post
[08:02:03] <znow> xec: ... this is weird.. check ac.znow.dk <- its running in production, no errors there.
[08:05:53] <xec> znow: but there is something horribly wrong, everything is really slow and every click on the page results in an error thrown
[08:06:08] <znow> xec: hmm
[08:06:48] <znow> xec: yeah I can see some of that...
[08:07:46] <opie-x> just built in unobtrusive image swapper for adam007 @ http://jsfiddle.net/andrewboudreau/XQcXf/33/
[08:13:30] <opie-x> eskihoe: i'm ready to fix your code if you're still around
[08:20:06] <znow> xec: well, I still get an error in jcarousellite
[08:20:23] <znow> xec: and only in that script
[08:23:56] <SoulRaven> is it posible somehow to call the colorpicker from webkit tools to my app and used?
[08:24:07] <xec> znow: are you able to reproduce the error in a fiddle?
[08:24:10] <znow> xec: when I run the site locally, in production mode, there is no js errors at all
[08:29:19] <Wiz_KeeD> how do i get $_GET variables from the url with jquery?
[08:38:29] <Whirl3d> Good morning all. I would like to add a number of constants to the jquery namespace for key names. Any advice/suggestions?
[08:47:13] <Whirl3d> tough room today. Is everyone at Church or something?

[08:54:13] <dabear> bot-t++
[08:54:15] <adam007> bla why in jsfiddle work but in my computer/local it is not work, you know why ?
[08:55:03] <bla> adam007, many reasons possible. Check javascript console for any errors for instance.
[08:55:38] <bla> You probably made an error, typo, forget to include something or are trying different (differently working) version.
[08:55:47] <bla> Don't assume anything, just check.
[09:41:39] <skylamer`> can i ask why ' html.empty() html.html('somedata') ' is making some thing different than 'document.getQueryselector('html').innerHTML = somedata' ? :)
[09:57:22] <kasper> anyone here familiar with "nivoslider"?
[09:57:44] <K3|Chris> kasper: yeah, it's ok
[09:58:50] <kasper> awesome :-) I would like to make a "progress bar" for it, you know - that loads until a new picture is shown and then the bar restarts
[09:59:17] <kasper> problem is I'm not sure how to implement it. I've made the bar with CSS3,  but I somehow need to time it, so that it'll sync with the slider ...
[09:59:54] <K3|Chris> not a clue
[09:59:59] <kasper> :-/
[10:00:11] <K3|Chris> I just put a generic loading animation throbber as the background image
[10:00:53] <kasper> the loader needs to be shown all the time. Here's what I've made so far: http://grobowski.neys.dk/
[10:01:21] <kasper> the yellow bar isn't placed where it should, I haven't bothered, but you can see what I mean? It has to complete when the new image fades in
[10:07:50] <kasper> so anyone have any idea on how to add a progress bar / timeline to an image slider?
[10:08:46] <deni> can anyone look at this: http://pastebin.com/pD6D7Hky

[10:09:46] <deni> i'm trying to change the css property
[10:09:50] <deni> but it's not working
[10:12:19] <eddiemonge> dont use live
[10:12:52] <eddiemonge> you need to cache $(this) becaues this in your json is not the same as the this from the callback
[10:12:58] <eddiemonge> for the click
[10:40:13] <deni> eddiemonge: how i go about doing that? what to use if not live?

[10:50:21] <eddiemonge> ?on delegation @ deni
[10:50:21] <bot-t> deni, The new .on() method supports delegated events as well. Read up on it at http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[10:50:37] <eddiemonge> objNoob: whats not working?
[10:51:18] <eddiemonge> killer11: i think perhaps you are in the wrong channel?
[10:51:26] <deni> eddiemonge: tnx...this did the trick....man i've been wrestling with this for hours...tnx man
[10:51:30] <killer11> my bad again
[10:51:32] <objNoob> when I call empty() on my collection
[10:51:55] <eddiemonge> Danny_B|backup: $("li").find("a[title^='abc']")
[10:52:34] <objNoob> it is not emptying items
[10:52:51] <eddiemonge> objNoob: not emptying them how? what exactly are you trying to do?
[10:53:14] <objNoob> I'm trying to reset some select boxes
[10:53:24] <objNoob> delete the options
[10:53:43] <objNoob> I want to put the select boxes into a collection
[10:53:58] <objNoob> jObj=$(this.selectbox1, this.selectbox2);
[10:54:04] <objNoob> jObj.empty();
[10:54:24] <eddiemonge> objNoob: empty doesnt reset them. see ? empty
[10:54:24] <bot-t> objNoob, .empty(): Remove all child nodes of the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/empty/
[10:55:05] <objNoob> Empty should delete the options
[10:55:17] <objNoob> options are the child nodes of a select element
[10:55:34] <objNoob> if I did $(this.selectbox1).empty();
[10:55:35] <objNoob> it works
[10:55:46] <objNoob> but I want to
[10:56:01] <objNoob> call empty() on a set of selectboxes at once
[10:56:15] <eddiemonge> that should work so if its not, then something else is going on
[10:56:17] <eddiemonge> ?Demo
[10:56:18] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:56:22] <objNoob> $(this.selectbox1, this.selectbox2).empty();
[10:56:28] <objNoob> that does not work
[10:58:24] <eddiemonge> well what is this? and if you do console.log(this.selectbox1, this.selectbox2) what do you get?
[10:58:30] <SoulRaven> is it correct when i insert a background-image base64 in a div:
[10:58:31] <SoulRaven>  $(pictureDivId).attr('background-image', 'url(\'' + oFREvent.target.result+ '\')');
[10:59:03] <eddiemonge> ?css @ SoulRaven

[11:01:00] <SoulRaven> $(pictureDivId).css('background-image', "url("+oFREvent.target.result+")");
[11:01:04] <SoulRaven> still not working:(
[11:02:01] <objNoob> <select id="site_prev" name="site"> <select id="shift_prev" name="shift">
[11:02:05] <Danny_B|backup> eddiemonge: well, when i attach .addClass("myclass") to it, it adds the class to <a> not to <li>. i'd need to work with that <li> instead (not only add class, but also some other stuff)
[11:02:07] <objNoob> that is what it gives me
[11:02:13] <eddiemonge> i think you need the data:image part of the url
[11:02:15] <objNoob> eddiemonge: <select id="site_prev" name="site"> <select id="shift_prev" name="shift">
[11:02:19] <eddiemonge> SoulRaven: what is that result?
[11:03:01] <eddiemonge> objNoob: then try jObj.find("option").remove()
[11:04:46] <eddiemonge> Danny_B|backup: then do filter(">a[....
[11:07:55] <murosai_> how is it possible that my .post callback function never gets executed?
[11:08:14] <eddiemonge> murosai_: because its failing. look at your network console
[11:09:04] <murosai_> network console shows 200 OK
[11:09:43] <objNoob> eddiemonge: var jObj=$(this.site).add(this.shift); jObj.empty();
[11:10:12] <objNoob> apparently .add doesn't modify the existing object, it returns a new collection with the added item
[11:11:05] <objNoob> so obj=$(); obj.add(); obj.add();  does nothing.
[11:11:23] <objNoob> so obj=$(); obj=obj.add(); obj=obj.add();  does something.
[11:12:19] <eddiemonge> murosai_: is it cached?
[11:13:01] <eddiemonge> objNoob: yeah. thats what the docs say. see ? add
[11:13:01] <bot-t> objNoob, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[11:13:22] <ajpiano> yeah, it's a known little caveat, i think everyone's probably run into that once
[11:13:36] <murosai_> nope
[11:15:06] <murosai_> does it matter what's the content-type of the post result?
[11:15:37] <objNoob> what does see ? add mean?
[11:15:37] <bot-t> .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[11:16:02] <eddiemonge> objNoob: its a bot-t command to send the doc page to you
[11:16:45] <objNoob> Nice!
[11:16:53] <objNoob> thanks
[11:17:02] <murosai_> yeah i changed the content-type and now it works :o
[11:21:54] <murosai_> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/ in this example it says $.post( url, { s: term },
[11:22:05] <murosai_> but shouldn't it be 's': term?
[11:23:40] <ericandrewlewis> if I have an function binded to an element, then remove the element, and add it back in, the function is unbinded to that element, right?
[11:23:56] <eddiemonge> murosai_: no
[11:24:10] <eddiemonge> murosai_: its object style, not json
[11:24:19] <eddiemonge> ericandrewlewis: yes
[11:24:40] <ericandrewlewis> tricky
[11:32:04] <surial> If I have some <button> elements in a <form>, hitting the enter key in any input area that's part of the form triggers the click handler of the button. How do I stop that?
[11:32:17] <surial> evt.preventDefault() is doing bupkis.
[11:33:18] <Majicpanda> background: url(images/hpfill.png) -0px 0 no-repeat  <- whats the best way to adjust the -0px # if i have a return var of 50, i simply need to set it to -50px
[11:33:44] <Majicpanda> .position?
[11:33:57] <JackBauer24> surial: preventDefault() must be working. Do you use it at the begging of handling the submit event?
[11:35:49] <Mekzholan> Can someone give me a hint on AJAX with jQ? I've got a self defined object that has a public method that loads a ressource by calling $.ajax. The "sucess" funtion should be a private method of that object (i.e. hidden in its closoure)
[11:35:49] <Mekzholan> How can I achieve that? (So far I could only call a public method...)
[11:36:21] <Majicpanda> ideally i want to get the current position of the bg and use animate to move it
[11:37:05] <JackBauer24> Majicpanda: just read the "background-position" css property
[11:37:27] <Mekzholan> \me is using the "Yahoo" module pattern to have private and public methods...
[11:40:12] <draginx> http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/ how can I append something to the beginning?
[11:41:27] <surial> JackBauer24: Yeah, sorry, it's working now. My bad.
[11:42:52] <JackBauer24> draginx: well, you can't append something to the beginning, it conflicts with the definition :) Use prependTo() - http://api.jquery.com/prependTo/
[11:43:02] <zduffy> Does anyone know how to copy form data from a dynamic drop down? The only way to get the second set of drop down boxes to work is by manually selecting them
[11:43:09] <draginx> JackBauer24: prepend ws the word that i was looking for :) thanks
[11:46:25] <objNoob> How can I test if an object is a member of a collection?
[11:49:25] <Majicpanda> how would i do the code? .css("background-image").animate() ?
[11:50:04] <eddiemonge> objNoob: for why?
[11:50:14] <eddiemonge> Majicpanda: what are you trying to animate?
[11:50:15] <draginx> how do I allow the submit when I've e.preventDefault() ?
[11:50:36] <Majicpanda> a background image moving 50px left
[11:50:49] <arthurdent> why can't i set a progress bar with a variable
[11:50:51] <eddiemonge> draginx: dont call preventdefault. only call it if you dont want to submit the form in an if block
[11:50:58] <draginx> ah ok
[11:51:08] <eddiemonge> Majicpanda: did you read the docs for animate and try it?
[11:51:20] <eddiemonge> arthurdent: i dont know. why cant you?
[11:51:42] <Majicpanda> yea but im not seeing a way to do a background image, just a whole div
[11:51:50] <objNoob> Well, because I want to conditionally perform some stuff
[11:51:57] <eddiemonge> Majicpanda: did you try it?
[11:52:03] <eddiemonge> objNoob: like?
[11:52:09] <arthurdent> eddiemonge: i just realised it was probably not casted to a number
[11:52:13] <Majicpanda> Uncaught TypeError: Object 0px 0px has no method 'animate'

[12:15:34] <muzone> Anybody know a nice and quick way via Chrome console / Firebug to check if jQuery works as it should?
[12:16:55] <eddiemonge> jBean: why dont you have renderComments in the load comments callback and then slideDown right after rendercomments in the same block
[12:17:43] <eddiemonge> muzone: works as it should? console.log($)
[12:18:32] <Time2303> heh, I'm new to programming and wish I knew what you're talking about ;p
[12:18:43] <Time2303> off to my jQuery tutorials
[12:19:00] <muzone> eddiemonge: yup if its loaded :D

[12:19:03] <muzone> bound: function () { return document.getElementById.apply(document, arguments) }
[12:19:05] <jBean> eddiemonge: they have to be seppered functions because they will be used in many other ways
[12:19:19] <eddiemonge> jBean: they can be still
[12:19:28] <muzone> eddiemonge: that means its all good right?
[12:19:47] <Time2303> eddiemonge, thanks I'll take a look.

[12:21:12] <eddiemonge> muzone: uh, sure. i dont know what you are trying to accomplish
[12:21:58] <muzone> eddiemonge: well I got jQuery loaded up with this Rails application, but none of my custom code seems to be working
[12:22:24] <magcius> ravenzz, not really what I'm doing.
[12:22:47] <magcius> ravenzz, see the "Click Here to Upload" button on http://minus.com/
[12:23:34] <ravenzz> magcius same thing I guess
[12:23:57] <ravenzz> I can't see the button anyway
[12:24:00] <magcius> Also, you didn't use the label tag properly there
[12:24:05] <eddiemonge> muzone: then maybe your custom code isnt being included correctly
[12:25:01] <ravenzz> magcius I have, it is valid as well
[12:25:20] <muzone> perhaps, thanks eddiemonge

[12:29:09] <magcius> eddiemonge, you're using Chrome? What version?
[12:29:28] <eddiemonge> Danny_B|backup: thats because you are changing to the anchor. you need filter or has

[12:37:04] <Danny_B|backup> eddiemonge: awesome - .has will fit my needs obviously. thank you
[12:37:48] <eddiemonge> jinside: live is deprecated
[12:37:57] <eddiemonge> jinside: and far far slower
[12:40:08] <objNoob> any way to put a ajax spinner in a select box? :D
[12:40:35] <objNoob> i think that would be an awesome way to show the user the content is loading
[12:41:01] <objNoob> i guess, I could fix a div over top of it
[12:41:15] <jinside> Oops. Sorry. eddiemonge, please re-read my Q and pretend I meant $.on() instead of $.live()... what would be the speed overhead drawback of $.on? significant?
[12:41:52] <Anticom> hi all
[12:41:59] <Anticom> i seem to have a problem with variable scoping
[12:42:07] <Anticom> here's a little example of what i'm trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/Y7zvW/
[12:42:10] <ajpiano> jinside: there is not a speed drawback to using event delegation
[12:42:20] <ajpiano> typically it's actually faster
[12:42:25] <ajpiano> with larger sets of bindings
[12:42:29] <ajpiano> cause you only have to attach a single event
[12:42:35] <jBean> when sould I use deferreds and when callbacks ?
[12:43:15] <jinside> ajpiano: so you're saying that $.on is smart enough to not autobind to the document when it doesn't have to go that far up? cause i remember that was why $.live was so slow... so i'm not sure why $.on would be faster than $.live was... i guess i should read the documentation :)
[12:43:33] <ajpiano> jinside: it binds to whereever you bind it...
[12:43:46] <ajpiano> $(document).on... $("#foo").on(...)
[12:43:47] <ajpiano> etc
[12:45:52] <jinside> but i'm specifically referring to using it for elements that will be created in the future
[12:45:58] <jinside> as was the purpose of live
[12:46:21] <jinside> how much slower would $on using element context instead of jut the click event? anyway, i'll just find out the hard way
[12:48:58] <jinside> thanks
[12:49:00] <ajpiano> jinside: do some perf tests
[12:49:05] <ajpiano> you are worrying about nonexistent issues.
[12:58:39] <eddiemonge> jBean: you should use callbacks when you can and deferreds when you cant
[12:59:20] <Time2303> I have 5 days a week without Uni but with the amount of stuff that I want to read to do with programming it's not enough xD
[13:00:35] <eddiemonge> Time2303: welcome to the real world. but try 2 days instead of 5, if even that
[13:00:47] <Time2303> D:
[13:02:45] <RandalSchwartz> Hmm.  I'm trying to give away $1000 tonight.  does the jquery project accept donations?
[13:02:50] <Time2303> o_O
[13:02:58] <Time2303> if jQuery doesn't, I do :<
[13:03:02] <RandalSchwartz> and if so, what would it be for?
[13:03:03] <ajpiano> RandalSchwartz: yes, indeed
[13:03:09] <Time2303> but: http://jquery.org/donate
[13:03:27] <Time2303> Website says "Your donations help support all development and maintenance activities of the jQuery Project.
[13:03:33] <RandalSchwartz> ok - I'll put it in the hat.
[13:03:40] <Time2303> nice
[13:03:47] <RandalSchwartz> from LinuxFund
[13:03:59] <RandalSchwartz> we've been quiet lately, so we're gonna give away $3000 this week. :)
[13:04:03] <ajpiano> RandalSchwartz: that's awesome, much appreciated
[13:04:23] <RandalSchwartz> not certain yet... dunno what the rest of the board will vote on
[13:04:29] <RandalSchwartz> but you'll know soon enough
[13:04:40] <jBean> all my method resuage in different cases seems to strange to use callbacks for me ... but when I simply try http://jsbin.com/ivicit/2/edit# it sucks because it renders before updating ?
[13:04:57] <RandalSchwartz> it's odd that jquery hasn't recieved anything in the past from LF
[13:05:04] <ajpiano> jBean: you're messing up the syntax
[13:05:08] <ajpiano> should be .done( renderComments )
[13:05:09] <RandalSchwartz> ... http://linuxfund.org/projects/past/
[13:05:13] <tfittsy> does anyone use the dataTables plugin for jquery?  I'm trying to make it so I can load data through ajax but then sort and filter it through javascript instead of sending ajax requests each time.
[13:05:17] <ajpiano> you're calling renderComments when you mean to be passing it
[13:05:20] <RandalSchwartz> I use datatables.net yes
[13:05:29] <RandalSchwartz> but not with ajax
[13:05:54] <tfittsy> RandalSchwartz: how big of a dataset are you using it on?
[13:06:01] <RandalSchwartz> it's all in memory
[13:06:09] <RandalSchwartz> sometimes 400-1000 lines though
[13:06:09] <Time2303> Nice, RandalSchwartz.
[13:06:31] <RandalSchwartz> I do it as a simple table, then let datatables mark it up
[13:07:32] <tfittsy> yeah, it works well for that size.  I have like 60,000 rows though so I'm trying to make it so I can limit the number of rows first and then use datatables on what gets returned of the 60,000
[13:08:42] <RandalSchwartz> oh - jquery is part of the SFC.  does that mean LF should pay SFC?
[13:09:50] <ajpiano> RandalSchwartz: NO
[13:10:08] <ajpiano> RandalSchwartz: we've left SFC, the announcement is coming this week
[13:10:33] <ajpiano> the information on jquery.org/donate is current
[13:11:20] <jBean> ajpiano: jeah awesome :) thanks a lot
[13:13:10] <RandalSchwartz> ahh!
[13:13:35] <RandalSchwartz> ok - I'll update my plea to the board. :)
[13:19:09] <pappastech> Has anyone here successfully used a .prepend( stuff ), where the string stuff contains an <input> tag?
[13:20:02] <pappastech> When I try it, it looks like it's filtering out some of what's in the string stuff before it adds it to the DOM.
[13:20:44] <eddiemonge> pappastech: is the string valid html?
[13:22:00] <pappastech> I can paste it here if that's a question.
[13:22:13] <pappastech> It's just an input tag with a couple attributes.
[13:22:27] <pappastech> I'd say yes.
[13:25:52] <jrockjiggz> pappastech: post your code
[13:26:23] <LekeFly> Anyone that could help me with the js error here? http://www.iphoneutstyr.no/untitled/kategori2/sugarfree-shoes-1.html
[13:27:38] <jrockjiggz> LekeFly: papTrack(); is undefined
[13:28:10] <jrockjiggz> also fancybox isn't a method
[13:31:04] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: did you look at the errors in the console?
[13:32:06] <ukukuk> hi i entered this channel. whats the problem LekeFly? Would you say it again?
[13:32:28] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: also, what are you using prototype for?
[13:33:30] <eddiemonge> i wish i could design
[13:34:41] <jrockjiggz> eddiemonge: i can help you
[13:35:21] <LekeFly> eddiemonge: Sorry for the late answers.. fixing my chair:p
[13:36:37] <eddiemonge> i think spartan designs are the hardest to pull off
[13:37:14] <LekeFly> So its fancybox who is failing? Do you see where.. ? i am checking console yes but its not making much sense
[13:37:46] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: i dont see where fancybox was included
[13:38:20] <LekeFly> i have it inline atm.. just testing
[13:38:20] <LekeFly> http://pastebin.com/XrUVPacS
[13:38:33] <jrockjiggz> jQuery(".fancybox-thumb").fancybox({
[13:39:55] <LekeFly> Should it be 	$(".fancybox-thumb").fancybox({ ?
[13:40:29] <jrockjiggz> are you including the plugin in your page
[13:40:46] <eddiemonge> ugh why do people keep using pastebin? until they fix their usability issues i really am going to boycott it
[13:41:11] <LekeFly> What service should use? :p
[13:41:53] <LekeFly> jrockjiggz: i am
[13:41:56] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: thats not including it, thats just calling it
[13:42:04] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: read the channel topic
[13:42:08] <eddiemonge> ?pe
[13:42:08] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net or http://jsbin.com otherwise I won't look at it. Pastebin.com sucks
[13:42:20] <LekeFly> jsfiddle is kinda overkill eh :p
[13:42:49] <LekeFly> eddiemonge: What do you mean with including it?
[13:43:19] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: i mean include the fancybox script so you can use it
[13:43:40] <eddiemonge> you cant just randomly call .fancybox() and expect it to work. you have to actually include the plugin that defines what it is
[13:43:57] <LekeFly> You mean the .js file.. ?
[13:44:04] <eddiemonge> yes
[13:44:08] <LekeFly> its there...
[13:44:34] <LekeFly> The js files are just merged
[13:45:10] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: its not finding it
[13:45:20] <LekeFly> Hmm
[13:45:34] <Chaval7> e
[13:45:42] <aroman> anyone here using tablesorter? Know how I might be able to sort by a checkbox element?
[13:48:17] <_Pepper> I am trying to transform a few elements using jquery before I want jQmobile to get to the DOM. I did read in the docs that order of execution of scripts would handle that yet it appears to be difficult to do. Any suggestions?
[13:49:07] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: your $ is also getting clobbered
[13:49:40] <LekeFly> eddiemonge: Where? :/
[13:49:57] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: i dont know. just try $("a") in your console
[13:50:13] <jrockjiggz> _Pepper: can you paste the code where you call your scripts and engage them
[13:50:31] <eddiemonge> ?noconflict @ LekeFly
[13:50:31] <bot-t> LekeFly, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[13:53:27] <_Pepper> jrockjiggz: I am using head.js for the loader since I am concerned about page responsiveness. My console.log is saying that the order of execution is being preserved as the head.js claims, yet the changes to the elements that I am doing before I call the jQmobile are not really sticking. Actually, they are but jQMobile seems to ignore the changes in the data-role since I was hoping to alter
[13:53:28] <_Pepper> the role in a few elements if a certain cookie was present. Any thoughts?
[13:55:39] <eddiemonge> how are you changing data-role?
[13:55:51] <jrockjiggz> _Pepper: my initial thought was to engage jqMobile with a callback after your changes.
[13:57:07] <_Pepper> eddiemonge: $(#idofelement).attr('data-role','whateverIwant')
[13:57:08] <LekeFly> eddiemonge: Removed the merging of files now and no error.. :/
[13:57:34] <eddiemonge> ?data @ _Pepper
[13:57:34] <bot-t> _Pepper, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[13:57:37] <eddiemonge> try that
[13:58:17] <_Pepper> jrockjiggz: yep, I was. The callback is handled by head.js and after my code executes it then loads jQmobile.
[13:59:09] <LekeFly> Maybe there is a way i can have the error appear again? or maybe Fancybox wasnt "closed" correctly.. so it messed up when it got merged?
[13:59:56] <_Pepper> eddiemonge: what would be the difference? deeper object binding with a data element? I am not sure the jQmobile is .data aware persay since it is heavily dependant on attributes ( which is what in essence .data does to a degree). Doesnt hurt to try thou.
[14:02:24] <cpaq> If I have <div style="display:none"><img src='A-huge-Image.png' /><div>, does the browser load the image?
[14:02:40] <bit8r> yes
[14:02:47] <cpaq> bit8r, thx
[14:02:57] <bit8r> you are wellcome ;)
[14:03:14] <LekeFly> cpaq: Maybe you could use Lazy load?
[14:03:34] <eddiemonge> cpaq: no
[14:03:54] <Tangaroa> images already are lazily loaded unless the browser developers have significantly changed something since the mid-1990s
[14:04:30] <bit8r> maybe I'm missing something, I'm open to apologises
[14:04:32] <eddiemonge> oh jk it does load
[14:05:54] <cpaq> Ok, suppose I use <div style='display:none'><img id='gonnashowlater' src=# /></div> then I use $("a.grp").fancybox() plugin to then show my hidden div, can I use a call back to set say $('#gonnashowlater').attr('src', 'A-huge-Image.png');
[14:06:19] <cpaq> I mean, anyone have experience with the fancybox pluging and know how to go about running such a call back function?
[14:07:00] <Tangaroa> I don't have experience with Fancybox, but the general idea of resetting src should work
[14:07:21] <cpaq> Tangaroa, thx, I'll try a site search for "call back"
[14:07:57] <cpaq> I don't know why they call it "call back", it confused me, "call next" or "call after" makes more sense to me
[14:08:04] <Tangaroa> cpaq: a callback is just a function that you define to be called later
[14:08:46] <bit8r> cpaq: are you meant to show the div after the image loads or what?
[14:08:53] <cpaq> Tangaroa, yeah I figured it out now, I guess they say back because it goes in the parameter list, and once you current function complete you go back to you parameter list and call that function
[14:09:22] <blindMoe> is the jquery touch plugin no longer in development?
[14:09:47] <Tangaroa> cpaq: I'm glad you figured it out because I worded it poorly
[14:09:47] <eddiemonge> blindMoe: it is
[14:10:05] <cpaq> bit8r, well, it does't really matter to me, dunno what you mean, you see, the fancybox will show a div, in the div I will have an image with src=#, I'd then like to call immediately and quickly .attr('src', "huge-file.png");
[14:10:08] <eddiemonge> blindMoe: but the developer was hired by sencha and the main jqTouch became Sencha touch
[14:10:16] <blindMoe> I want to simply add touch events to an existing draggable / sortable setup but I don't want to rely on jquerymobile or jqtouch
[14:10:24] <eddiemonge> cpaq: why not change it before you call it?
[14:10:26] <blindMoe> eddiemonge: ahh ok
[14:11:57] <cpaq> eddiemonge, how would i do it, cause see, I have about 40 thumbs, and when you click them, I wanna show a high res image of each thumb together with a paragraph, so if i show before, then I have load 40 high res images, I'd rather only load them one at a time and if only use requests it
[14:12:35] <hash> cpaq: maybe, you need preload
[14:13:00] <eddiemonge> cpaq: then you are going to have to wait for each to load and the user might not like that
[14:13:28] <cpaq> eddiemonge, I don't mind that, computers can load one at a time fast enough for a good use experience
[14:13:33] <bit8r> cpaq: maybe if you use onStart ?
[14:14:03] <RandalSchwartz> is the reason for leaving the SFC public yet?
[14:15:20] <eddiemonge> cpaq: i meant the downloading and then displaying
[14:16:07] <cpaq> eddiemonge, its not issue for one image, it would be for 40, especially if the user doesn't even wanna look at the high res pics
[14:17:08] <eddiemonge> cpaq: thats what im saying, loading a high res pic  will take time
[14:17:10] <Tangaroa> cpaq: another possibility is to start the loading on mouseover of the thumbnail and turn on display after the user clicks through
[14:17:19] <eddiemonge> ?preloadimages @ cpaq
[14:17:25] <bot-t> cpaq, Highlight Changes - We've been looking to provide a higher-quality, spam-free experience at the plugins site for some time, and a major error on our part forced us to shut down the current site before we could put the... http://plugins.jquery.com/projects/plugins?page=143&keywords=&type=All&sort_by=changed
[14:17:40] <eddiemonge> ugh.
[14:17:51] <cpaq> I'm not worried up loading a single image
[14:17:59] <cpaq> Its not that high res
[14:18:34] <bit8r> cpaq: the problem is fancybox copies the content to a new div so you would have to debug it in order to locate the div with the copy. Just use 'onStart' callback and change the images you want
[14:19:04] <bit8r> if you change the original div it won't change anything
[14:24:22] <cpaq> bit8r, how would I use onStart?
[14:25:02] <bit8r> when you call fancybox
[14:25:09] <bit8r> as an option
[14:25:30] <_Pepper> anyone here a Fight the FOUC lover? I have a nooby question about how to Fight the FOUC (a la Paul Irish style )
[14:25:34] <bit8r> 'onStart': function (){ … };
[14:26:33] <bit8r> or just put a reference to a function's name if you are tidier
[14:26:51] <eddiemonge> danheberden: why are the domain names only renewed for one year at a time?
[14:27:12] <cpaq> $('.mydiv').fancybox({ 'onstart' : function () {...}; });
[14:27:50] <cpaq> onStart
[14:27:52] <bit8r> yes, but forget the ;
[14:28:07] <bit8r> cause it's inside an object
[14:28:15] <cpaq> $('.mydiv').fancybox({ 'onstart' : function () {...} });
[14:28:19] <bit8r> sure
[14:28:26] <cpaq> bit8r, thx
[14:28:42] <bit8r> or 'onStart' : yourfunction
[14:28:54] <bit8r> and declare that function on the same scope
[14:29:00] <bit8r> you should be done with that
[14:29:11] <bit8r> wellcome
[14:29:12] <bit8r> ;)
[14:30:46] <blindMoe> if I have a ul that is a sortable and thge ul is set to overflow hidden, is it possible to have an element that is currently being drug to be visible outside of the ul ?
[14:31:50] <blindMoe> I was thinking about using jquery to change the overflow value to visible using the .start() and setting it back to hidden on .stop() but was wonde3ring if there is a better way
[14:32:11] <_Pepper> blindMoe: if the element was not visible to start and the sort order re-arranged the elements and it comes to the top then it would.
[14:32:37] <blindMoe> well the element is visible on start
[14:32:45] <blindMoe> actually the overflow is set to auto.. not hidden
[14:33:15] <_Pepper> blindMoe: overflow is a bit dangerous play with if your design is heavily box model based. Auto works well and if it survives in there then it should be ok.
[14:33:16] <blindMoe> but the problem is that now when I try to drag an item out of my sortable onto my "trash can" div... the item is not visible once I drag it out of its container ( the ul in this case )
[14:33:55] <eddiemonge> dont user overflow then
[14:34:19] <Tangaroa> Is there an easy way to read the shorthand CSS properties that .css() does not support, like background, margin, and border?
[14:34:33] <_Pepper> blindMoe: what did you want to happen?
[14:34:51] <blindMoe> I want the sortable item to remain visible even when dragged out of the containing element
[14:35:13] <_Pepper> and into the "trash can"?
[14:35:45] <blindMoe> yeap
[14:35:58] <bit8r> Tangaroa: afaik shorthand properties doesn't exist
[14:36:14] <bit8r> they're just a way to swirte css properties but no different properties
[14:36:28] <bit8r> swirte=write
[14:36:30] <_Pepper> Tangaroa: not sure I understand, do you want and easy way to read shorthand css or an easy way to see what shorthand properties .css does not support?
[14:36:48] <eddiemonge> Tangaroa: what do you mean does not support?
[14:37:27] <_Pepper> blindMoe: is the trash can a ul of items and styled to be visible?
[14:37:45] <bit8r> if you need to know if a property has been writen shorthand way you should parse the original css text
[14:38:11] <blindMoe> _Pepper: one sec.. I am creating a js fiddle to mimic it
[14:39:18] <_Pepper> Tangaroe: here is a nice resource to help you remember shorthand conventions in CSS as well. http://www.vcarrer.com/2010/01/css-shorthand-clockwise-rule.html
[14:39:45] <_Pepper> blindMoe: that will help, thanks.
[14:40:24] <LekeFly> eddiemonge: Could it be another plugin that is messing with fancybox making the code not run? if the other plugin isnt closed right or something.. for as what i can see it seems to be etalage who is messing up..
[14:40:38] <eddiemonge> LekeFly: lint your code
[14:40:39] <blindMoe> arg wtf... it works correctly in the js fiddle :)
[14:40:40] <blindMoe> of course
[14:40:48] <_Pepper> lol
[14:41:05] <_Pepper> that has happened to me before. Something in your CSS is the issue :P
[14:41:19] <blindMoe> yeah
[14:41:21] <_Pepper> cause jsFiddle has it's own styles and stuff
[14:41:27] * blindMoe breaks out the shovel and starts digging
[14:41:28] <LekeFly> eddiemonge: http://www.iphoneutstyr.no/untitled/kategori2/away-knit-pullover.html it works now.. what i did was move the etalage.js file at the bottom of the merged js
[14:41:50] <LekeFly> So that means its not closed correctly or something.. rrright?
[14:41:59] <LekeFly> Im just guessing here..
[14:42:21] <andrew___> hihi
[14:42:41] <andrew___> I have a form, it's to export to csv or xml.. To change the fields displayed, is it good idea to
[14:42:56] <andrew___> just hide the rows containing those inputs depending on a radio button at the top?
[14:43:13] <_Pepper> jQmobile question: will jQuery Mobile not trigger if you access a jQMobile page with a desktop browser? or will it just treat it like a grade A mobile device?
[14:43:16] <andrew___> Most of the forms are the same.
[14:43:20] <blindMoe> _Pepper: it is the overflow-y: auto that is doing it on my containing div... kind of need it in there though
[14:45:04] <_Pepper> blindMoe: hmmm, that is a tough one.
[14:45:25] <blindMoe> http://jsfiddle.net/e7wAG/
[14:45:43] <blindMoe> I think it is the combination of absolute positioning on the container div as well as the overflow settings
[14:46:02] <blindMoe> was able to recreate it in that jsfiddle
[14:47:12] <cpaq> Loading 100 images of 100kb each, too much?
[14:47:34] <blindMoe> seriously?>
[14:47:46] <cpaq> I have no idea
[14:47:48] <blindMoe> 10 MB's of files
[14:48:03] <cpaq> yeah, thats a lot for measely webpage eh?
[14:48:03] <blindMoe> that is pretty damn large and would take most people a while to download all those images just for a web page
[14:48:19] <blindMoe> I try to keep my pages < 500k and that is still pretty large
[14:48:24] <fof> depends on what the images are for.. if it's a photo series like InFocus then fine
[14:48:33] <cpaq> blindMoe, how do you calc your page load?
[14:48:53] <blindMoe> by the size of all the elements being loaded ( css, js, images, code )
[14:49:03] <cpaq> blindMoe, manually?
[14:49:10] <cpaq> how big is jquery itself?
[14:49:16] <blindMoe> no there are a ton of tools to help you
[14:49:27] <blindMoe> firebug, yslow, chrome /safari developer tools
[14:49:47] <cpaq> you have experience with chrome, how do I see page load?
[14:50:22] <coldhead> cpaq: jquery fits on line of code, if it's a very very long line
[14:50:44] <blindMoe> cpaq: look at the network tab in either chrome developer tools or firebug
[14:50:52] <cpaq> coldhead, hehe, yeah I know, but I meant in kb's
[14:50:52] <blindMoe> google can help you with these questions
[14:50:57] <cpaq> I guess I could look it up eh
[14:51:19] <blindMoe> 31Kb
[14:51:25] <bit8r> cpaq, it's no problem how big it is if you make the user not notice that
[14:51:40] <bit8r> the img src change is a well idea you had to start
[14:52:35] <bit8r> try to keep all your js in one file, your css in another and so just to not make lot of calls to the server
[14:52:42] <cpaq> bit8r, yeah, I am still gonna try that
[14:52:44] <blindMoe> anyone see a way to get this sortables items to be viewable outside of the containing div?   http://jsfiddle.net/e7wAG/5/
[14:53:16] <_Pepper> blindMoe: have you tried using a jQuery scrollbar instead that creates a nested div effect that does not use overflow-x: hidden?
[14:53:27] <blindMoe> nah I haven't
[14:53:33] <blindMoe> like jScrollPane  ?
[14:53:45] <_Pepper> that is the issue since the element inside will not be able get out of the overflow. http://baijs.nl/tinyscrollbar/
[14:53:48] <bit8r> but today connections don't cry for that size. If you must show that images, try to load the other site elements before and you should have no problem with page load
[14:54:04] <blindMoe> ahh nice it has phone support.. needed in this app
[14:54:39] <bit8r> cpaq: you can create that div dinamically before fancybox call with $('body').append();
[14:54:56] <bit8r> and after entire page loads of course
[14:55:16] <cpaq> bit8r, yeah, I was thinking that too
[15:00:34] <NoReGreT> I have this http://pastie.org/3522042 how can i reach '.msg p' starting for $(this) being '#NewsAEmailForm"
[15:02:50] <_Pepper> $('.msg p')? you do not need $(this)
[15:03:24] <bit8r> NoReGreT: wait, I got you
[15:03:43] <NoReGreT> cool
[15:04:29] <_Pepper> $(this) will just get you the element that fired the event. Do you need to crawl upwards? cause you can do it using parent(), but that would be a bit costly in terms of cycles of functions call.
[15:04:48] <_Pepper> NoReGreT: makes sense?
[15:05:58] <NoReGreT> _Pepper: thta's what I need, so i tried .parent().previous().previous().find('p') is that about right ?
[15:06:37] <ThemNuts> hey guys, i use CodeIgniter and now im adding jQuery to a form to confirm an option. Now on confirmation i need it to submit to the url "customers/new". I found that the document.confirmation.submit(); submits the form, but how do i set to where it has to submit it?
[15:07:09] <_Pepper> if you really want to crawl backwards you can do this: $(this).parent().prev().prev().prev().find('p').
[15:10:13] <_Pepper> ThemNuts: does your form action point to where you need it go? document.confirmation.submit(), will submit the form to the action value. If you need to have form and there are some options that require you to post to other locations that are not part of the form, then jQuery and Ajax can help. Makes sense?
[15:11:09] <ThemNuts> no it doesn't have an action set, maybe a good idea to do that, although in the tutorial i found for the dialog box there wasen't added one
[15:11:15] <ThemNuts> i'll give it a try
[15:12:20] <blindMoe> _Pepper: even the tinyscrollbar plugin requires overflow hidden on one of the containing elements so the same problem occurs
[15:12:35] <_Pepper> blindMoe: :( /sigh....
[15:13:06] <blindMoe> what is funny is that the drop event still happens.. you just can't see it happening because the element is hidden
[15:13:28] <_Pepper> well it looks like the only course of action is your original thought. Start(), Stop(), and you are going to have to play with z-index
[15:14:00] <blindMoe> yeah I tried z-index and it didn't matter due to the overflow hidden
[15:14:22] <_Pepper> .... overflow is nasty...
[15:15:13] <blindMoe> this is the only time I ahve ever had a problem with it
[15:15:32] <blindMoe> I am sure I could restructure the ui to not get around it but it is a pita
[15:20:26] <ThemNuts> can i add and send along a POST value with jQuery? Like on clicking yes, add $myvar = 'yes'
[15:20:38] <ThemNuts> in addition to the form post values that is
[15:24:16] <bit8r> ThemNuts: you can create a hiden input and change it's value with jquery before submitting
[15:24:27] <ThemNuts> right
[15:24:56] <ThemNuts> but you can't say like $_POST['myvar'] = "foo" ?
[15:25:45] <blindMoe> _Pepper: ugly but it works:  http://jsfiddle.net/e7wAG/22/
[15:25:57] <blindMoe> wish I had IE to test it in on this computer
[15:26:22] <bit8r> ThemNuts: if you want the form send the values, no
[15:26:37] <ThemNuts> ok thnaks
[15:30:10] <bit8r> what osx irc client do you prefer? I'm using colloqy but seems too naive...
[15:30:47] <blindMoe> is it possible to queue up a .remove()?  I am trying but .remove() always seems to be run before an animation is finished.  I tried adding a .delay() before the .remove() as well but it wasn't respected
[15:30:56] <blindMoe> bit8r: I use kvIRC
[15:31:10] <bit8r> blindMoe: thanks, I'll gave it a look
[15:31:32] <blindMoe> ahh found my answer... callback function for .remove()
[15:33:37] <_Pepper> blindMoe: I took a peak at sortable, and no luck. Sorry. The overflow clearly the issue. Not sure if I can help other then agreeing that ui change maybe the best approach. The other option would be to ajax into a fixed height div and binding a refresh on scrollchange. Smells like a plugin I may take on :)
[15:34:24] <blindMoe> _Pepper: isn't that basically what tinyscrollbar is attempting to do though?
[15:34:37] <blindMoe> seems like you won't be able to position the inner content w/o the overflow: hidden
[15:35:01] <blindMoe> arg I have been sitting for to long... need to go move around
[15:35:39] <blindMoe> _Pepper: now that I have it working by setting the overflow to visible it is actually kind of nice.. this way the user can see what is down below while sorting and it makes it a little easier ( doesn't look as good but functionaly  I think it may be good )
[15:36:59] <_Pepper> lol, /sigh overflow is bad, the less we use the better :)
[15:37:05] <blindMoe> hehe true
[15:37:13] <blindMoe> ok.. I am getting off the computer
[15:37:16] <blindMoe> have a good rest of your day
[15:37:19] <blindMoe> thanks again for the help
[15:37:24] <_Pepper> np, anytime
[15:46:32] <zduffy> How can you set the default value of a drop down box that is dynamic?
[15:47:26] <bit8r> selected="selected" on the default option
[15:47:27] <zduffy> I know I would use $("select#country").val(""); but i am not sure what to set val to
[15:48:16] <bit8r> mmm maybe $("select#country").attr("selected","selected);
[15:48:20] <bit8r> not sure
[15:48:31] <zduffy> hmm
[15:48:47] <zduffy> Theres a list of about 40 countries, and I want to select United States
[15:49:33] <bit8r> $("select#country [value=xx]").attr("selected","selected");
[15:49:46] <bit8r> xx is the value in the United States option
[15:50:47] <zduffy> Awesome. I will try that. Than kyou
[15:51:06] <bit8r> good luck ;)
[15:51:39] <coldhead> zduffy: http://jsfiddle.net/mpaLq/
[15:51:51] <coldhead> that's probably a less good way than bitsy's
[15:53:32] <zduffy> coldhead: how would I specify which select?
[15:53:35] <zduffy> the id is country
[15:54:27] <zduffy> nvm
[15:56:56] <bit8r> that's a good way too
[15:57:11] <zduffy> bit8r: that works, but I'm still stuck here.. I have an on change event that fires after country is selected. Now that obviously isn't going to fire
[15:57:59] <bit8r> so you need to trigger or not to trigger that?
[15:58:14] <Trav198423> moring all
[15:58:14] <zduffy> To trigger
[15:58:27] <zduffy> But it needs to trigger on change as well incase they reselect another country
[15:58:28] <Trav198423> morning rather
[15:59:04] <dereine> hi
[15:59:11] <Trav198423> is someone able to give me a hand? i'm trying to hide/unhide a div when I hover/mouseover other div, but having a faceplam moment?
[15:59:40] <dereine> Trav198423: just a short guess: you use bind('hover')?
[16:00:24] <dereine> i'm writing some qunit tests for my jquery code, i'm wondering is there a way to test a real link click, without breaking the actual test?
[16:00:30] <zduffy> Trav198423: $('#mydiv').blur(function() {
[16:00:30] <zduffy>   $('#yourdiv').hide();
[16:00:31] <zduffy> });
[16:00:46] <bit8r> zduffy: just create a function for the onchange event so you call it once loaded and reference it on the onchange event
[16:00:53] <Trav198423> i was trying to use .hide() .show()
[16:01:34] <zduffy> bit8r: onload?
[16:02:47] <bit8r> zduffy: http://jsfiddle.net/chaval/mpaLq/4/
[16:03:09] <bit8r> sry zduffy http://jsfiddle.net/chaval/mpaLq/5/
[16:03:35] <Trav198423> sorry still a little unsure, this is what i'v tried so far http://jsfiddle.net/KLc5G/
[16:05:52] <Trav198423> what i've got so far doesn't seem to work, infact it crashes IE lol
[16:08:13] <zduffy> bit8r: thank you. Now of course it broke my date picker lol
[16:09:07] <bit8r> zduffy: just tidy your code a little bit lol
[16:09:32] <zduffy> bit8r: that still doesn't allow me to select state… it says state but no data is there :(
[16:09:52] <zduffy> I got to this point by popping that function onload
[16:10:02] <bit8r> zduffy: can you show it?
[16:10:16] <eddiemonge> Trav198423: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/KLc5G/2/
[16:10:25] <zduffy> Let me jsfiddle it
[16:10:40] <zduffy> Proprietary sucks
[16:11:43] <bios> hey *.. quick question..
[16:12:13] <bios> if I'm using a plugin and everytime a function in that plugin is called I want to call one of my functions.. can I use bind for that.. or how can I listen for that ?
[16:13:50] <panchot> hi
[16:14:39] <bios> hey panchot
[16:15:08] <bios> anyone around?
[16:15:22] <bios> out of almost 1k people
[16:15:24] <bios> :]
[16:15:31] <wookiehangover> bios: ask away
[16:15:41] <bios> if I'm using a plugin and everytime a function in that plugin is called I want to call one of my functions.. can I use bind for that.. or how can I listen for that ?
[16:15:44] <wookiehangover> I'm sure its a low-level hardware question, right?
[16:15:56] <bios> ^ exactly!
[16:16:10] <bios> I'm super noob
[16:16:23] <bit8r> lol
[16:16:26] <wookiehangover> so the only way to "listen" for that would be to have a custom event that the plugin would "trigger"
[16:16:29] <bios> just a pre-warning :]
[16:16:45] <wookiehangover> so, you likely want to just pass a callback to the plugin
[16:16:49] <wookiehangover> which plugin is it?
[16:17:01] <bios> Jquery.Cycle.lite
[16:17:11] <Trav198423> eddiemonge: Nope didn't work... the div's don't change on-click, any ideas?
[16:17:30] <BillCriswell> Trav198423: Can you post some code somewhere?
[16:17:31] <bios> I need to run a function every time it runs the "go" function
[16:18:02] <eddiemonge> Trav198423: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/KLc5G/3/
[16:18:19] <johnkpaul> bios: you could monkey patch the go function, but it's not straightforward
[16:18:29] <bios> yeah.. I was hoping there'd be a better way
[16:18:55] <johnkpaul> not without the plugin cooperating
[16:19:03] <johnkpaul> if they gave you hooks for it
[16:19:03] <eddiemonge> bios: unless there is a callback for you to use, you;ll have to extend it
[16:19:19] <bios> ok.. then I'll do that
[16:19:22] <bios> thanks you guys!!
[16:19:29] <bios> sorry.. I really am new to js
[16:19:38] <bios> but jquery makes it much nicer
[16:19:40] <bios> :]
[16:20:23] <eddiemonge> Trav198423: that what you wanted?
[16:22:36] <Trav198423> thanks for the help, it works on jsfiddle
[16:22:44] <Trav198423> but it doesn't seem to work on my site
[16:22:49] <eskihoe> hai.. halp..
[16:22:55] <zduffy> bit8r: http://jsfiddle.net/UBWvk/1/
[16:23:00] <RandalSchwartz> just make jsfiddle your site. :)
[16:23:11] <Trav198423> lol
[16:23:19] <zduffy> starting of it anyways.. I've had to redo it several times do to the stupid magic mouse
[16:23:32] <Trav198423> that would be nice but its for an intranet
[16:24:20] <Trav198423> Can i send a zip of contents for someone to take a look at?
[16:24:21] <eskihoe> Part 1 : http://pastebin.com/zTD2dsww data.php = http://pastebin.com/CqRv3VKG
[16:25:06] <eskihoe> Problem... When I choose something from the drop down, it's suppose to go to the if statement, and choose what I want it to echo.. Pretty much wanting to show another menu
[16:25:10] <eddiemonge> Trav198423: i supposed
[16:25:21] <eskihoe> Kinda like.. select Ford, and it shows ford cars..

[16:26:22] <eskihoe> http://eskiho.mine.bz/gomez/test1.php
[16:27:35] <eskihoe> I just started trying to learn jquery at 2 am lastnight
[16:27:45] <eskihoe> Didn't appear to be difficult to learn.. so im still at it, but eh
[16:27:49] <eskihoe> Baby bugs fml
[16:28:19] <Trav198423> eddiemonge: Thanks mate, here's the link http://skynetworks.net.au/portal.zip
[16:28:23] <bios> k.. thx * .. I got it..
[16:28:40] <bios> seems a bit wonkey to have to modify the plugin. but i guess that just means it wasn't built very well :]
[16:29:58] <eddiemonge> eskihoe: whats wrong with it?
[16:30:32] <eskihoe> Well, when i select numbers, I only want the data from if statement for numbers to showup.
[16:30:41] <eskihoe> same for letters..
[16:30:45] <eskihoe> instead im getting
[16:30:51] <eskihoe> 12345ABCDEF for letters
[16:30:53] <eskihoe> etc..
[16:31:22] <eddiemonge> eskihoe: looks like your php is wrong then
[16:32:06] <eskihoe> eh
[16:32:24] <eskihoe> thats some basic php, im sure its...correct
[16:32:47] <eddiemonge> Trav198423: your tables are empty
[16:33:41] <Trav198423> the tables are populated via js/scripts.js with data from an xml file in the data folder
[16:34:06] <eskihoe> Can anyone else see any issues with my code?
[16:34:09] <Trav198423> maybe that's why i'm having issues?
[16:35:27] <eddiemonge> Trav198423: are you replacing the tables or appending to them?
[16:35:38] <eddiemonge> eskihoe: look at your returned json
[16:35:45] <Trav198423> eskihoe: I don't know alot but do you maybe need an else statement?
[16:35:46] <eddiemonge> or not json, the returned html
[16:37:16] <zduffy> Why does this not load the states? and copy? http://jsfiddle.net/UBWvk/4/
[16:37:23] <eskihoe> found it.
[16:37:29] <Trav198423> eddiemonge: neither, I just want to hide the tables until I hover over the correct div box
[16:37:34] <eskihoe> I put semi colons at the end of the if statement.
[16:37:43] <eskihoe> if($blah=blah); <--- BAD
[16:37:44] <eskihoe> :'(
[16:37:57] <eskihoe> should be if($blah == $blah) {
[16:37:58] <eddiemonge> eskihoe: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/LZWu3/
[16:38:45] <eskihoe> ah yeah
[16:38:56] <eskihoe> so jquery can adopt things..
[16:39:03] <eskihoe> if i create a function within a function..
[16:39:14] <eskihoe> I can use $this-> to get the parent function var?
[16:39:59] <eskihoe> It's working... Thanks fellas.
[16:40:39] <eskihoe> http://eskiho.mine.bz/gomez/test1.php
[16:40:42] <eskihoe> :)
[16:40:44] <eskihoe> thankies.
[16:41:02] <Trav198423> np
[16:43:44] <Trav198423> eddiemonge: so yeah, I just want to hide all tables by default (except maybe the first one) and then show each one with a hover event (the over will be on the box div class) does that make any sense? lol
[16:44:07] <Trav198423> i've been trying to get this to work for last 15 hours :/
[16:44:50] <Blaster> is it possible to send cookie headers with a $.ajax call ?
[16:45:19] <eddiemonge> Trav198423: modify the example i showed you
[16:46:40] <Trav198423> eddiemonge: yep, tired that but nothing seems to happen on the hover event, it's freaking weird
[16:47:34] <eddiemonge> Trav198423: you need to simplify and figure out whats not working
[16:48:21] <Trav198423> does the doctype matter or maybe the version of jquery?
[16:50:00] <eddiemonge> no, as long as its not jquery like 1.1
[16:50:28] <Trav198423> ahh cool thanks, at least I can rule that out
[16:50:48] <eddiemonge> Trav198423: actually, for my example you need jQuery > 1.7
[16:51:14] <Trav198423> ahh okay i'm using 1.5.2
[16:52:38] <Trav198423> crap, that fixed it!
[16:52:50] <Trav198423> who would have thought
[16:53:23] <eddiemonge> i would have
[16:53:38] <zivester> does anyone know any good tutorials about monitoring .scroll() while still having a fairly responsive UI?  I'm seeing some lag in firing my function on every scroll()
[16:53:45] <Trav198423> eddiemonge: lol, true. thanks mate you're a champ
[17:01:30] <thejohnfreeman> does jquery provide a utility to turn any JavaScript object into an observable that could be used with things like .on()?
[17:05:16] <kenyabob> Can I anyone help me figure out what is controlling the hover effect on the bottom half of this screen? http://themes.allur.co/prolific/
[17:07:41] <eddiemonge> kenyabob: i find its best to view source
[17:08:09] <kenyabob> eddiemonge: Ive been looking over it, I just can't see where the effect is being triggered
[17:08:22] <kenyabob> and the effect is called, so I can grab the right script
[17:08:55] <aroman> lol
[17:09:04] <aroman> inspect element ftw?
[17:09:45] <kenyabob> eddiemonge: (sorry, closed me window, not a rage quit)
[17:10:00] <fof> http://pastebin.com/7NeDwvcL
[17:10:25] <cpaq> I want to alert(this.ID), know what I mean, I wanna see the id of the current object?  What is correct syntax please?
[17:11:13] <fof> just from a quick inspect
[17:11:26] <ngharo> cpaq: this.id
[17:11:27] <b0x> console.log
[17:11:42] * b0x frowns upon alert()
[17:11:57] <eddiemonge> cpaq: or $(".class").attr("id")
[17:11:58] * Time2303 frowns at b0x
[17:12:39] <cpaq> alert($(this).attr('id'));
[17:12:42] <cpaq> says undefined
[17:13:11] <Time2303> same scope as id?
[17:14:23] <cpaq> nevermind guys, I need to think for myself for a bit, thanks though
[17:23:24] <cpaq> I have <div id='me'><img src=# /></div>, I wanna select as: $('#me > img').attr('src', 'image.jpg'); So what I am asking is how do I select the image element that is child of a div by the name of me
[17:24:42] <eddiemonge> huh?
[17:25:10] <cpaq> eddiemonge, I think I got it correct there
[17:25:45] <cpaq> $('div#me > img) selects the img element contained with <div id='me'><img src=#></div>
[17:26:52] <eddiemonge> $("#me").children("img")
[17:27:11] <eddiemonge> faster
[17:27:19] <eddiemonge> id's by themselves are fastest
[17:27:27] <RandalSchwartz> $('#me img') would suffice
[17:27:35] <RandalSchwartz> for all img that are beneath
[17:27:42] <RandalSchwartz> if it needs to be immediate children...
[17:28:09] <eddiemonge> not as fast though
[17:28:42] <RandalSchwartz> ahh - > is children
[17:28:44] <RandalSchwartz> just like css
[17:29:01] <RandalSchwartz> $('#me > img')
[17:29:09] <fof> read that avoiding sizzle when possible is good
[17:29:13] <RandalSchwartz> that's dangerous though if anyone ever inserts a layer in between
[17:29:35] <fof> (for speed)
[17:29:56] <RandalSchwartz> don't prematurely optimize :)
[17:30:06] <RandalSchwartz> I doubt you'd see the difference in practice
[17:30:23] <cpaq> thx guys
[17:30:57] <fof> yeah, it's treated like a bit of a footnote on jqfundamentals
[17:31:56] <cpaq> if you #me is a javascript variable, as in var jvar="#me"; then it would go $(jvar '> img')
[17:32:07] <eddiemonge> well if you insert stuff, of course stuff is probably going to break
[17:32:17] <eddiemonge> cpaq: +
[17:32:24] <eddiemonge> jvar + "> img"
[17:32:59] <cpaq> oh yeah, eddiemonge thanks
[17:34:28] <cpaq> You know, I am getting my element ID using a function, and in Chrome it gets http://localhost/compX/#me, but I am thinking, might it be different for different browsers and if the site is loaded on different servers, cause extracting the #me is easy enough if I count up to the last /
[17:34:47] <eddiemonge> RandalSchwartz: id say 50% improvements are good pretty much all the time
[17:35:58] <eddiemonge> cpaq: window.location.hash
[17:36:54] <cpaq> eddiemonge, thx
[17:38:45] <cpaq> eddiemonge, sweet that hash works perfect
[17:39:25] <RandalSchwartz> it's pretty unlikely that that one change will make your entire app go 50% faster
[17:39:53] <RandalSchwartz> again - premature optimization
[17:39:58] <cpaq> ok, I did it then, instead of loading the high res pic that is fancybox() overlaid, it only load if a person clicks to overlay, otherwise the src=#
[17:40:02] <RandalSchwartz> beware of :)
[17:41:40] <eddiemonge> theres premature optimization and then theres knowing what will be faster for not much of a downside
[17:43:04] <eddiemonge> knowing what best practices are
[17:57:15] <yamahaalex37> where do you think the future of MVC web apps resides? PHP or Javascript?
[17:57:31] <fof> i think the advice was good, so long as he wont go through all his code and spends hours over a few millseconds :)
[18:00:13] <RandalSchwartz> I certainly hope PHP is *not* the future of web apps. :)
[18:00:35] <RandalSchwartz> ... http://tnx.nl/php.jpg
[18:00:48] <jpk> Is there an event that fires when an element changes size because it's content changed?  For instance, when I $('#some_div').html(...) and the stuff I'm putting in #some_div causes it to expand.
[18:02:06] <eddiemonge> yamahaalex37: yes, front end and backend
[18:03:13] <yamahaalex37> ok so js
[18:03:22] <eddiemonge> thats not what i said
[18:03:31] <fof> php is like a caked back-end
[18:03:35] <eddiemonge> rails is like unicycle with no seat
[18:03:50] <eddiemonge> python is like a tank with no viewports
[18:04:07] <eddiemonge> jpk: no
[18:06:24] <fof> rather a tank with no viewports than a caked back-end or unicycle with no seat
[18:07:20] <yamahaalex37> eddiemonge, then what did you say
[18:07:23] <jpk> eddiemonge: Hm, gotcha.  So if I wanted to run some code when it changed size, I'd have to fire a custom event every time I .html()ed it?
[18:09:22] <eddiemonge> yamahaalex37: i said front end and backend
[18:10:08] <eddiemonge> jpk: yes
[18:10:10] <yamahaalex37> eddiemonge, but what were you referencing? was that a response to my question
[18:10:49] <eddiemonge> "where do you think the future of MVC web apps resides? PHP or Javascript?"
[18:11:16] <eddiemonge> you cant have a frontend without a backend or a backend without a frontend
[18:11:30] <eddiemonge> well you can but itd be hard and youd be relying on other's services
[18:12:16] <ShawnRisk> How do I make two divs visible when I click on a button?  I can get one, but everywhere I read seems really hard to get two of them.
[18:14:18] <eddiemonge> $("div1").show(); $("div2").show()
[18:14:30] <eddiemonge> $("div1, div2").show()
[18:14:46] <eddiemonge> $("div1").add("div2").show();
[18:14:54] <eddiemonge> fadeIn()
[18:14:59] <eddiemonge> slideDown()
[18:15:03] <eddiemonge> toggleShow()
[18:15:11] <eddiemonge> show("fast")
[18:16:06] <yamahaalex37> eddiemonge, so you were answering: PHP or Javascript? with front end and back end
[18:16:07] <yamahaalex37> confused?
[18:16:26] <eddiemonge> im not confused
[18:16:40] <fof> ShawnRisk: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/sthvf/
[18:19:25] <ShawnRisk> fof: what if I am using, <a href="javascript:toggleDiv('price-group');">Add to Basket</a> and function toggleDiv(divId) { $("#"+divId).toggle(); }
[18:19:48] <eddiemonge> ShawnRisk: dont you inline js. thats just dirty
[18:20:01] <fof> inline js in html is not easy to maintain
[18:20:09] <Eviltwin> It's not only dirty, it's downright wrong
[18:20:13] <Eviltwin> And evil
[18:20:14] <Eviltwin> And bad
[18:20:21] <Eviltwin> Distilled badness
[18:21:33] <ShawnRisk> okay thanks
[18:23:56] <ShawnRisk> fof: how would I toggle this instead of just showing this?
[18:24:07] <eddiemonge> ?toggle @ ShawnRisk
[18:24:08] <bot-t> ShawnRisk, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/

[18:25:01] <nod00> can someone help me debug my jquery?
[18:25:21] <fof> it's ok, have a look at jqfundamentals if you're interested
[18:26:17] <fof> i really liked it
[18:26:33] <coldhead> nod00: can you be more specific?
[18:27:36] <nod00> is there anything wrong with these two lines? It gives me 0 everytime even though I have several divs with that class
[18:27:41] <nod00> var x = $('.hidden').toArray();
[18:27:42] <nod00> alert(x.length);
[18:28:05] <nod00> can i even store it into x like that?
[18:28:36] <fof> http://jsfiddle.net/sthvf/2/
[18:28:41] <fof> nod00 ^
[18:29:36] <eddiemonge> ?alert
[18:29:37] <bot-t> Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[18:29:55] <nod00> thanks fof
[18:29:58] <fof> length is property of query object, so you need to wrap it with $()
[18:30:30] <eddiemonge> no its not.
[18:30:36] <eddiemonge> length is pure javascript
[18:30:46] <eddiemonge> can be used on an array
[18:30:55] <eddiemonge> and jQobjects are array-like
[18:32:02] <fof> yes it works unwrapped, ignore me nod00
[18:32:22] <fof> your problem was something else
[18:33:28] <nod00> lol im kinda new to jquery, but your solution lead me to my problem. I didnt have:
[18:33:30] <nod00>  $(function() {
[18:33:59] <nod00> im guessing its not going to do anything unless I tell it to do so...
[18:35:15] <fof> yes thats short-form for $(document).ready (dom ready)
[18:35:24] <nod00> i see
[18:35:34] <nod00> i keep forgetting to use that =/
[18:36:28] <coldhead> never use the short form
[18:36:30] <coldhead> ever
[18:36:40] <coldhead> unless you are sure no one else will see the code
[18:36:59] <coldhead> because every time you use it some child will see it an join #jQuery to ask what the difference is
[18:37:14] <coldhead> and everytime that happens my inner child falls down some stairs
[18:37:29] <coldhead> and my inner housekeeper has to scrub the blood off the stairs
[18:37:51] <fof> sorry (dom ready) isnt related to the code, it would be (handler)
[18:39:12] <fof> if they dont know jq they may be equally confused in long or short-form :p
[18:41:00] <ShawnRisk> fof: does this code have to be on the same pages?  I can't add the jquery code to another page?
[18:41:20] <coldhead> fof: so let's just confuse them with one thing :P
[18:46:53] <fof> ShawnRisk: you can link to an external js file wherever
[18:48:19] <ShawnRisk> fof: I did and get this error: TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating '$('#addshow').on')
[18:48:36] <theBrettman> hey guys. got a fun challenge... is there someway to manage a table in the console from another site that's not mine so I can sort the results?
[18:49:10] <theBrettman> I'm sure there is but not sure what's available, prolly  more than one way but if there's something designed specifically for it...
[18:49:39] <fof> ShawnRisk: should probably follow a jquery tutorial introducing the basics
[18:51:56] <ShawnRisk> fof: okay
[18:52:10] <ShawnRisk> fof: I tried the code in your fiddle and this works
[18:55:26] <theBrettman> and I mean without a plugin, btw...
[18:57:15] <StevenCodes22> www.stevencodes.com/
[18:59:02] <coldhead> StevenCodes22: you should capitalize "Js/Jquery" as "JS/jQuery"
[18:59:05] <coldhead> it bugs some people
[18:59:18] <StevenCodes22> coldhead:  will do
[19:00:07] <coldhead> cool, you have custom paste and IRC in the header
[19:00:14] <adam007> hello any people kan help me ?
[19:00:33] <coldhead> adam007: can you be more specifc?

[19:02:26] <adam007> http://jsfiddle.net/andrewboudreau/XQcXf/39/ opie-x last night help me Indonesia time :D
[19:02:35] <coldhead> can you just put the whole site on jsfiddle?
[19:02:37] <coldhead> then it will work
[19:02:39] <coldhead> case closed
[19:03:17] <coldhead> okay so this works great
[19:03:31] <coldhead> are you sure jQuery is being included on your local version?
[19:03:37] <eddiemonge> are just jsfiddle as your site!
[19:03:41] <coldhead> are you using localhost and not file:/// ?
[19:04:09] <adam007> i already use local and file but it is still not work,, and i already include latest jquery,,
[19:04:10] <adam007> wait
[19:04:18] <coldhead> StevenCodes22: i was all excited about the bird images and then http://www.stevencodes.com/854 :(
[19:04:33] <coldhead> are you sure you are including it CORRECTLY
[19:05:25] <StevenCodes22> coldhead:  yeah I know I got reupload some posts just moved servers
[19:05:40] <coldhead> ah cool
[19:05:41] <ShawnRisk> fof: I did follow jquery tutorials and still not getting anything
[19:05:49] <coldhead> lemme see when they're up StevenCodes22!
[19:06:42] <eddiemonge> ShawnRisk: maybe its time to go out into the real world to get some?
[19:07:09] <adam007> http://pastebin.com/ahbLv18C here i use in my local
[19:07:11] <eddiemonge> adam007: are you putting your code in a doc.ready() block?
[19:07:16] <ShawnRisk> eddiemonge: some what?
[19:08:05] <adam007> in where ?

[19:11:53] <eddiemonge> ShawnRisk: did you look at see ? ftj
[19:11:54] <bot-t> ShawnRisk, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[19:15:35] <ShawnRisk> eddiemonge: yes, but I am unsure how to fix this even with reading that page.
[19:16:41] <eddiemonge> fix what?
[19:19:45] <Rockfang> howdy all
[19:20:17] <ShawnRisk> eddiemonge: I am getting this error: TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating '$('#addshow').on') on this line:  $('#addshow').on('click', function() { })
[19:22:41] <eddiemonge> ShawnRisk: there should be more to that line than that
[19:23:39] <eddiemonge> ShawnRisk: what version of jquery are you using?
[19:23:54] <theBrettman> anyone know how I can add scripts to pages through the console?
[19:23:55] <ShawnRisk> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/sthvf/3/
[19:24:07] <theBrettman> like add jquery and ui to a page?
[19:24:25] <eddiemonge> theBrettman: why?
[19:24:53] <eddiemonge> ShawnRisk: again, what jQ version
[19:25:07] <ShawnRisk> eddiemonge: I am using jQuery 1.2.6
[19:25:16] <Vorspire> Oo
[19:25:34] <eddiemonge> ShawnRisk: thats why
[19:25:36] <theBrettman> so I can sort tables I find on webpages
[19:25:43] <ngharo> theBrettman: var d=document;var h=d.getElementsByTagName('HEAD')[0];var j=d.createElement('SCRIPT');j.type='text/javascript';j.src='http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.js';h.appendChild(j);
[19:25:53] <eddiemonge> you cant just decide to use new stuff with an olddddddddddddddddddddddd jQuery version
[19:25:59] <theBrettman> nice!
[19:26:21] <eddiemonge> theBrettman: thats silly. or you could get the jqueryify plugin
[19:26:34] <theBrettman> it doesn't add ui tho
[19:26:53] <ShawnRisk> eddiemonge: hahaha, I didn't, I forgot to tell people in here what I was using.  How do I make this work with 1.2.6?
[19:27:01] <eddiemonge> you dont
[19:27:05] <eddiemonge> why dont your upgrade?
[19:28:06] <eddiemonge> i mean seriously, 4 years old: http://docs.jquery.com/Release:jQuery_1.2.6
[19:28:32] <tash> I want to programmatically create a textbox when someone chooses an option from a select, and put that textbox in a <div> on my page. Can someone help me out?  So far, I've got $('#myID').change(function() {  });  I just don't know what to put in the curly's :(
[19:29:22] <eddiemonge> ?append @ tash
[19:29:23] <bot-t> tash, .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[19:30:08] <theBrettman> I got tampermonkey for chrome and a script from userscripts.org but it doesn't automatically add it. idk if I run a function from the script or what. be nice if they included the usage on the scripts page. like how hard is it to say "just run runscript() in your console"?
[19:35:19] <ShawnRisk> eddiemonge: you were right
[19:42:02] <tash> eddiemonge: thanks, that is getting me in the right direction.
[19:42:38] <tash> I am able to create the textbox I want now.  But, it isn't showing up in the source of the page. I want to be able to get the value of that programmatically created textbox when I submit my form.
[19:44:45] <nickelnick> hey all am i just being silly here or what? im trying to select this. <span id="3" class="voteCount">1</span> with $('span#'+ modelId +'.voteCount')
[19:45:22] <nickelnick> i'm trying to get the value from the id=3 of class voteCount
[20:10:55] <Whirl3d> Evenin' all. Here's a quickie: could someone advise me on the use of $.map with an array rather than a jquery object? I have a array of objects (each object contains a regex and an error msg) and a value that I want to test each regex against, appending the error if it fails..
[20:39:42] <tash> so if I programmatically create a textbox onChange of a select, and do either .append or .html within a <div>, how can I get the value of the textbox I created if it isn't showing up in the page source?
[20:42:48] <biffy_> do you give it an id, any way to select it using a selector?
[20:46:57] <lucasreis3000> hello
[20:47:14] <lucasreis3000> someone know how can i Animate scrollLeft? and increment this?
[20:49:19] <lucasreis3000> nobody?
[20:50:41] <coldhead> did you try googling for "jquery animate scrollLeft" ?
[20:50:55] <coldhead> there are hundreds of pages just waiting to talk you through it!
[20:51:01] <lucasreis3000> yes
[20:51:10] <lucasreis3000> but i don't see the increment way
[20:51:40] <coldhead> $('thing').animate({scrollLeft: '+=200px'})
[20:51:45] <coldhead> check the docs for animate
[20:51:48] <coldhead> it's something liek that
[20:51:50] <coldhead> ?animate
[20:51:51] <bot-t> .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[20:52:02] <lucasreis3000> i try this
[20:52:05] <lucasreis3000> but didn't work..
[20:52:08] <lucasreis3000> I don't know why
[20:52:15] <lucasreis3000> the animate function works for Links?
[20:52:20] <lucasreis3000> or only for buttons?
[20:52:21] <b1lly> lucasreis3000: what are you trying to do
[20:53:26] <coldhead> animate works for anything with CSS, pretty much
[20:53:45] <lucasreis3000> http://www.agencialego.com.br/clientes/teste54/
[20:53:47] <lucasreis3000> look
[20:53:49] <lucasreis3000> see the arrows
[20:53:52] <lucasreis3000> in the right and the left?
[20:54:07] <lucasreis3000> when I click in this…i want to roll the page to the left '200px' or more..
[20:54:52] <Algo> I don't know how to use autocomplete, even after reading docs :<
[20:55:25] <coldhead> i don't think you're using this scrollSmooth thing correctly, lucasreis3000
[20:55:37] <coldhead> it looks like you're telling the <a> to scroll
[20:55:43] <lucasreis3000> yes...
[20:55:45] <coldhead> and surely it's some content you want to scroll
[20:55:47] <coldhead> not the arrows
[20:56:10] <lucasreis3000> but if i erase scrollSmooth?
[20:57:16] <coldhead> you didn't even mention scrollSmooth
[20:57:23] <coldhead> you asked about animate and scrollLeft
[20:57:30] <coldhead> i had to find scrollSmooth myself
[20:57:44] <eddiemonge> smooth scroller. isnt that a song?
[20:57:59] <biffy_> no, you are thinking of smooth criminal
[20:58:14] <lucasreis3000> but
[20:58:21] <lucasreis3000> scrollSmooth make what i want to do?
[20:59:00] <coldhead> i hope so
[20:59:23] <lucasreis3000> well...
[20:59:24] <lucasreis3000> how?
[20:59:27] <tash> biffy_: yes, I give it an ID
[20:59:33] <tash> it just doesn't show up when I view source
[20:59:59] <biffy_> it wont. the dom is not updated during the life cycle of the page. well it is, but the source is not
[21:00:13] <tash> ah
[21:00:19] <biffy_> so if you add a textbox with id 'newtb' you can find it with $('#newtb')
[21:00:22] <Algo> can anyone help me understand how to use autocomplete in jquery?
[21:00:30] <tash> biffy_: I shall try that now.
[21:00:52] <biffy_> tash: if you still need help jsfiddle an example
[21:01:00] <tash> biffy_: sure, np
[21:01:38] <tash> what's the easiest way to test....with my select I did a .change, but will a .change work for a textbox?
[21:02:05] <lucasreis3000> coldhead ?

[21:05:53] <lucasreis3000> coldhead*
[21:06:03] <lucasreis3000> now I remove the smothScrool to the site?
[21:06:05] <coldhead> good luck lucasreis3000
[21:06:05] <lucasreis3000> right?
[21:06:11] <coldhead> yes, you don't need that crap
[21:06:15] <lucasreis3000> ty!
[21:06:18] <lucasreis3000> lets go to test.
[21:08:53] <lucasreis3000> strange
[21:09:12] <lucasreis3000> if I remove smooth scroll all the jquery in the page stops to work.
[21:09:28] <coldhead> uh oh
[21:09:51] <lucasreis3000> very strange
[21:10:00] <lucasreis3000> wtf is that?
[21:10:22] <coldhead> maybe you removed too much?
[21:10:31] <coldhead> are you seeing any error messages in the console?
[21:11:03] <coldhead> Whirl3d: if you still need help with your map() can you put what you have up on jsfiddle?
[21:11:27] <lucasreis3000> no O.o
[21:11:57] <coldhead> leave it in?
[21:12:00] <coldhead> and fix it later?
[21:13:03] <duryodhan> I am trying to create a slideshow which fades out  current slide and fades in the new slide http://jsfiddle.net/XPydk/2/ .. only problem is the user is scrolled to the top of the slideshow. Any ideas on how I can avoid that? I thought min-height would fix it
[21:13:36] <lucasreis3000> coldhead I need to fix that...
[21:14:10] <coldhead> i understand
[21:14:57] <lucasreis3000> if I don't remove smoothScroll, your script will not work?
[21:15:23] <coldhead> what i wrote doesn't use smoothScroll
[21:15:30] <coldhead> so it shouldn't matter
[21:15:46] <coldhead> you will need to remove the line in your code that uses smoothScroll
[21:15:54] <MontyCarleau> Hey guys.  If I want to modify a CSS class, is there any way of modifying the class so that the changes propagate, as opposed to selecting all members of the class and having the change applied to each of them?
[21:16:30] <lucasreis3000> well
[21:16:31] <lucasreis3000> removed
[21:16:36] <lucasreis3000> but don't work yet
[21:16:49] <coldhead> MontyCarleau: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/622122/how-can-i-change-the-css-class-rules-using-jquery
[21:17:08] <kara_sweets> can someone please explain to me what "Core" refers to if someone references "var Core = window.Core"
[21:18:17] <lucasreis3000> coldhead see the website?
[21:18:35] <coldhead> i don't see the code i wrote in this site, lucasreis3000
[21:18:43] <coldhead> when i run it from the chrome web console it works
[21:18:52] <coldhead> and i am enjoying a smooth scrolling experience
[21:19:05] <coldhead> such as i usually have to pay a lot of money for
[21:19:29] <coldhead> kara_sweets: it looks like they're creating a local copy of a global variable called Core
[21:19:34] <coldhead> but i don't know what Core is
[21:19:37] <coldhead> could be anything
[21:19:50] <coldhead> it's just badly named, that's all i can tell
[21:19:51] <lucasreis3000> when you open my website in chrome
[21:19:55] <lucasreis3000> works?
[21:20:10] <kara_sweets> oo ok
[21:20:29] <coldhead> i don't know what to test, lucasreis3000
[21:20:51] <lucasreis3000> well
[21:20:52] <coldhead> it seems to
[21:20:54] <lucasreis3000> click on the arrows..
[21:20:56] <coldhead> i can get to the contact form
[21:21:00] <lucasreis3000> but didn't work..
[21:21:16] <coldhead> the arrows don't do what i my code told them to do
[21:21:22] <coldhead> but i don't see you using my code
[21:21:27] <coldhead> so i am not surprised
[21:22:27] <lucasreis3000> no?
[21:22:29] <lucasreis3000> i use
[21:22:32] <lucasreis3000> look for jquery.anchor
[21:24:35] <coldhead> cool
[21:24:41] <coldhead> get rid of the first function
[21:24:52] <coldhead> just use the ones after "i suggest"
[21:25:03] <coldhead> and give the <a>'s classes like i suggested
[21:25:09] <coldhead> so they can have different functions
[21:25:16] <coldhead> <a class="left" href="#">
[21:25:24] <coldhead> and <a class=right" href="#">
[21:25:26] <coldhead> and it should work
[21:25:39] <coldhead> you probably want it to scroll more and faster
[21:25:42] <lucasreis3000> i already make this...
[21:25:47] <lucasreis3000> look to the line
[21:25:49] <lucasreis3000> 270
[21:25:50] <lucasreis3000> and 272
[21:26:38] <infid> in jquery, does wrapping $() around any element allow you to use jquery's methods on it? For example, if i have a variable named mousemoveVar, can i do $(mousemoveVar).position(); ?
[21:26:45] <coldhead> cool thanks lucasreis3000
[21:27:01] <coldhead> now just get rid of the first function in anchor.js
[21:27:06] <coldhead> the one that beings $("a[href^=#]").click(function () {
[21:27:18] <coldhead> that selector is too general
[21:27:52] <lucasreis3000> yes
[21:28:06] <lucasreis3000> this is for what
[21:28:07] <lucasreis3000> ?
[21:28:28] <coldhead> this is for making it better
[21:28:33] <coldhead> okay the reason it doesn't work now
[21:28:34] <coldhead> is
[21:28:49] <coldhead> you are loading anchor.js before the <a>s have loaded in the html
[21:29:00] <coldhead> you need to either move the <script> to the bottom of the page
[21:29:04] <coldhead> so the <a>s are loaded already
[21:29:05] <coldhead> OR
[21:29:08] <coldhead> use ?ready
[21:29:08] <bot-t> .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[21:29:23] <conancat> hey guys!
[21:29:29] <coldhead> wrap everything in anchor.js with $(document).ready(function () { .... });
[21:29:49] <lucasreis3000> ah
[21:29:50] <lucasreis3000> yes
[21:29:59] <lucasreis3000> wait
[21:30:15] <coldhead> do i have to? i'm getting terribly tired and bored
[21:31:44] <lucasreis3000> well done
[21:31:46] <lucasreis3000> see there
[21:31:59] <lucasreis3000> but
[21:32:02] <lucasreis3000> its a kind of bug
[21:32:03] <lucasreis3000> you see?
[21:32:16] <lucasreis3000> i think this is a conflictt with smooth scrool
[21:32:41] <coldhead> yes you need to get rid of smooth scrol
[21:32:52] <coldhead> it is throwing an error in the console
[21:33:02] <lucasreis3000> yes
[21:33:08] <lucasreis3000> but see the animation
[21:33:13] <lucasreis3000> scrolls more than 200
[21:33:25] <coldhead> yes, i think that might be smooth scroll
[21:33:31] <coldhead> get rid of smoothscroll
[21:33:38] <coldhead> and we can talk about any remaining bugs
[21:34:37] <lucasreis3000> ok
[21:36:50] <conancat> hi guys!
[21:37:01] <coldhead> hello, yes
[21:37:09] <conancat> not sure if this is the right place to ask, but anyone has experience with YouTube API?
[21:37:23] <conancat> i'm having this problem that the first video that loads the player gets all the necessary methods --
[21:37:32] <conancat> http://i.imgur.com/0cI4h.png
[21:37:40] <conancat> but the second video that loads doesn't -- http://i.imgur.com/qc8gX.png
[21:37:49] <conancat> and this problem only occurs in certain webkit browsers on certain OS and i can't pinpoint why it happens
[21:37:51] <conancat> :(
[21:38:57] <lucasreis3000> cold head why the page are flashing when i click in the arrows?
[21:39:20] <coldhead> i do not know, lucasreis3000
[21:39:28] <coldhead> oh
[21:39:32] <coldhead> maybe you need return false;
[21:39:36] <coldhead> in the click functions
[21:39:52] <lucasreis3000> returni false?
[21:40:00] <lucasreis3000> in the end off every click?
[21:40:06] <donCams> no return no exchange
[21:40:14] <coldhead> at the end of both of them yes lucasreis3000
[21:40:18] <lucasreis3000> ohhh
[21:40:20] <lucasreis3000> i put
[21:40:22] <lucasreis3000> works
[21:40:24] <lucasreis3000> man...

[21:40:38] <coldhead> you are welcome, lucasreis3000
[21:40:44] <coldhead> i hope your site is a success, it looks very nice
[21:40:44] <theBrettman> what's the selector to find an element with certain text in it?
[21:40:46] <lucasreis3000> and look up for bugs
[21:40:55] <lucasreis3000> thanks coldhead
[21:40:55] <coldhead> conancat: i think you need to post this to the youtube dev forum
[21:41:04] <coldhead> you might find someone there who can help
[21:41:15] <coldhead> and if it's a bug with youtube those guys will need to fix it for you
[21:41:27] <adam007> http://jsfiddle.net/andrewboudreau/XQcXf/39/ why this script not work in local
[21:41:37] <coldhead> ?:contains @ theBrettman
[21:41:38] <bot-t> theBrettman, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[21:42:04] <lucasreis3000> I'm going to sleep

[21:42:18] <coldhead> goodnight lucasreis3000
[21:42:48] <coldhead> adam007: we can't tell why is not work on local unless we can see the code you us on local
[21:44:37] <conancat> i see! thanks coldhead for the pointer
[21:44:48] <conancat> i'll go look out there :D
[21:45:10] <adam007> coldhead this (http://pastebin.com/9f6BTv9D)
[21:45:11] <coldhead> the dev team seem pretty responsive :)
[21:45:36] <coldhead> adam007: <script type="text/text/javascript">
[21:45:40] <coldhead> that might be your problem
[21:45:52] <coldhead> browsers will ignore that because what is text/text/javascript?
[21:47:22] <adam007> changed but still same
[21:47:58] <coldhead> adam007: add alert("YES THIS IS WORKING") inside the script tag
[21:48:04] <coldhead> to make sure it is actually working
[21:48:27] <ngharo> hello, yes this is dog
[21:48:52] <coldhead> HELLO DOG
[21:49:01] <adam007> added and i can see the alert
[21:49:36] <coldhead> okay thank you!
[21:50:17] <coldhead> adam007: in the pastebin you showed me
[21:50:30] <coldhead> line 68-71
[21:50:45] <coldhead> that runs a function for each of the matching elements
[21:50:53] <coldhead> i don't think there will be any matching elements at that point
[21:50:58] <coldhead> because the page has not loaded yet
[21:51:07] <conancat> hello dog lol
[21:51:10] <coldhead> you need to wrap them in $(document).ready(function () {...
[21:51:16] <coldhead> ?ready @ adam007
[21:51:16] <bot-t> adam007, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[21:51:28] <adam007> http://pastebin.com/SQ5kNWVZ
[21:51:41] <adam007> thats ?
[21:52:35] <adam007> the script is coded by opie-x
[21:53:55] <coldhead> adam007: http://pastebin.com/diff.php?i=q2BSELL9

[21:56:12] <coldhead> just make the change i made
[21:56:26] <coldhead> so jQuery doesn't do any of that code until the DOM is "ready"
[22:06:46] <adam007> i have 2 image, each image hve name image1bw, image1cr, image2bw and image2cr... if i hover image1bw the image will change to image1cr. and after i click image, and without hover image the image permanently change to image1cr,  <<< that is already on the script

[22:55:55] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ adam007
[22:55:56] <bot-t> adam007, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[22:56:02] <Eviltwin> Err
[22:56:04] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ adam007
[22:56:04] <bot-t> adam007, Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[22:56:09] <Eviltwin> I always forget my shortcuts
[22:58:51] <adam007> http://jsfiddle.net/XQcXf/41/
[23:01:27] <adam007> eviltwin i want the image when i click the first image,, and after i click second image, the image i can hover and unhover
[23:01:35] <adam007> i mean un active click
[23:02:25] <adam007> Eviltwin you there ?
[23:04:01] <feathersanddown> I know is not related, but someone may know the answer, how to disable genius bar in youtube embed thumbs ?
[23:04:39] * coldhead changes the channel name to #jQuery-and-YouTube
[23:05:06] <feathersanddown> *disable = hide
[23:05:54] <coldhead> CSS?
[23:06:21] <adam007> coldhead to who you chat ? if me,, i use jquery
[23:06:34] <Eviltwin> adam007: Is this what you were looking for? http://jsfiddle.net/XQcXf/42/
[23:07:19] <coldhead> adam007: you don't need any of my "help" if Eviltwin is on your case
[23:07:59] <coldhead> i'm the doctor nick to his doctor hibbert
[23:08:00] <Eviltwin> I'm kinda like 0.00004% here
[23:08:15] <coldhead> mmm, floating point
[23:09:31] <adam007> Eviltwin : no, if i click first image, it will change permanently, but after i click second image, the first image can change to the first condition ( i can hover the image)
[23:09:48] <Eviltwin> So is it supposed to flip back or what?
[23:10:10] <adam007> flip back,,
[23:15:55] <defendguin> http://pastie.org/3524080   I'm trying to bind an event to the click of a list view item in JQM and it was working for a while but all of a sudden it stopped working  pasted is the click handler and the function that builds the list items that the click handler is supposed to be binding to
[23:16:17] <defendguin> please let me know if you see anything obvious
[23:16:50] <Eviltwin> adam007: More like this? http://jsfiddle.net/XQcXf/43/
[23:17:55] <defendguin> can something be getting in the way of the click handler or should it eventually fire?
[23:18:18] <Eviltwin> If the click event's propagation is stopped somewhere then yeah
[23:18:52] <defendguin> hmmm
[23:19:35] <defendguin> well all of the them have a href=#event which switches them to another page
[23:19:36] <adam007> eviltwin you are best :) thx for that :D
[23:20:31] <adam007> defen you want like tab ?
[23:22:04] <defendguin> Eviltwin: figured it out i had a handler on the 'pagecreate' of the #event page and and when i changed that to a 'pageshow' it allowed the event to fire
[23:23:12] <Whirl3d> Evenin' all. Is it appropriate to use $.map in this manner: I have an array of objects, each object contains two attributes: reg (regexp) and msg (an error msg if regexp fails). I wondered if it was a good idea to use map like: $.map(validationList, function () {var rule=this, reg=rule.reg, isvalid=reg.test(val);  return isvalid?null:rule.msg;};
[23:25:25] <Eviltwin> Why do that when you can do function() { return this.reg.test(val) ? null : this.msg } instead?
[23:25:29] <Eviltwin> All that var clutter
[23:25:33] <Cork> Whirl3d: you might want to have a look at grep see $.grep
[23:25:52] <Eviltwin> Yeah, true, that might be a better method
[23:27:54] <adam007> Eviltwin why i test in local it is not working ?
[23:29:00] <Eviltwin> Because either you didn't copy it correctly or you didn't properly clear your cache
[23:29:03] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, yeah. I was trying to make it obvious what I was trying to do, so I hear ya. Cork, I looked up grep (actually,  google didn't like $.grep...for some reason) and I'm not sure how that applies.
[23:29:37] <adam007> opss sory :D i forget to add $(document).ready(function () { :D
[23:29:45] <Cork> Whirl3d: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/
[23:29:47] <adam007> but it is work fine now :)
[23:30:50] <Whirl3d> weird that Google didn't list that at all when I searched for $.grep, huh? Thanks cork, I'm reading it now
[23:32:54] <adam007> any way thanks eviltwin :D
[23:36:04] <Whirl3d> Cork, I am glad to know about grep, but the examples given deal wtih filtering multiple values in an array. I want to apply multiple regexp to the same value and only return the ones that fail....It seems like grep should work, but I'm just not quite getting it yet...
[23:37:49] <Algo> cesaro Eviltwin http://jsfiddle.net/e8XJh/ first item always undefined...it really shouldn't be doing that...because its telling me it can't find something...but I print it out and it's there... I've run out of ideas... I can't squash this bug
[23:38:44] <Cork> Whirl3d: if you just want to return parts of the original array, then ya you need map; if you have two arrays its doable
[23:38:47] <Cork> (and simpler)
[23:39:02] <Cork> so ya, it depends on your structure
[23:40:17] <Whirl3d> okay, so then one last thing: within a $.map(array, function () {    "this" refers to the current element in the array, right?
[23:40:28] <StevenCodes221> Whirl3d:  mmhmm
[23:43:13] <Whirl3d> StevensCodes221, thx for the reply. Cork thx for the help and info. Is there any easy way to determine if something is a regexp or a function? In otherwords, in my validation array, some of the elements are going to be functions and some are regexp...any easy way to know which is which?
[23:46:18] <Xotix> hi
[23:56:34] <Xotix> http://jsfiddle.net/DLrbw/ why are the edit icons not exactly at the left top corner of the images?
