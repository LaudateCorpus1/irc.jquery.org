[12:47:16] <znf> say I have a bunch of links with I'm adding /after/ document is ready (via ajax), can I somehow bind an event (ie: click() { e.preventDefault() }) before I create them?
[13:00:31] <znf> ie: https://jsfiddle.net/Znuff/9bpLuvcj/2/
[13:01:32] <znf> ah, delegate
[13:01:33] <znf> doh
[13:08:31] <robertmaxrees> use .on()

[13:14:02] <Starship808> hi :) i'm looking for a wizard/steps plugin that allows me to create steps with multiple options. most plugins require me to select something and then click "next". i want the next step to appear once an option is selected
[13:14:47] <robertmaxrees> there's a good chance that one of the ones you've looked at has a way to do that.
[13:16:36] <Starship808> i havent found one
[13:16:54] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing a few of the plugins out and we can take a look? :)
[13:17:35] <Starship808> thats the most popular i think http://www.jquery-steps.com/
[13:18:08] <Starship808> thats an interesting one as well https://oguzhanoya.github.io/jquery-steps/
[13:18:27] <Starship808> i dont want to spam in 20 link now ^^
[13:19:56] <Starship808> maybe i am looking for the wrong keywords
[13:25:13] <robertmaxrees> you could likely wire up the behavior you're looking for pretty trivially.  just catch clicks/changes and then run .click() on the "next" button.
[13:30:46] <Starship808> yeah
[13:31:00] <Starship808> thought there must be something that can do this out of the box
[13:32:19] <robertmaxrees> it's kind of an unusual ask if i'm honest.
[13:32:40] <Starship808> i dont think so
[13:32:50] <robertmaxrees> it's a UI antipattern :)
[13:33:10] <Starship808> it depends on the use case
[13:33:19] <robertmaxrees> what's your use case? :)
[13:34:19] <Starship808> a wizard with 3 steps, each step includes 3 options presented as icons. i want to go to the next step when i select an icon. why would i want to select the icon and then click next. thats one useless click
[13:34:47] <robertmaxrees> that's not why you include the next button - you include it in the event that the user mis-clicked.
[13:34:57] <robertmaxrees> and would like to change their selection.
[13:35:14] <Starship808> you can always go back
[13:35:24] <robertmaxrees> then you're penalizing the user for making a mistake.
[13:35:41] <robertmaxrees> in my experience, you want to let them confirm before moving on.
[13:35:44] <Starship808> no i am penalizing the user who makes the right click
[13:35:47] <Starship808> with an extra click
[13:35:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:36:02] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[13:37:08] <Starship808> take tinder, you can swipe left and right
[13:37:15] <Starship808> would you implement a next button? Lol
[13:37:22] <robertmaxrees> that's a very different use case.
[13:37:37] <robertmaxrees> that's part of what makes tinder unique.  your use case is very different.
[13:38:07] <Starship808> well i dont agree on that
[13:38:10] <robertmaxrees> your use case is configuration, not snap judgements.
[22:04:33] <engaged> If I have a variable like number = “3 (10%)” and I just want to get the “3” part into a new variable how can I get it… the string is always in the format: X (Y%)
[22:09:35] <pavonia> Use a regex
[22:09:47] <pavonia> But this isn't really a jQuery question
[22:40:31] <primitivMedia>     $("body").on("click", ":not('.twitter') a.js-remove-list-item", function() {
[22:40:35] <primitivMedia> any ia what im doing wrong
[22:40:40] <primitivMedia> it still targets .twitter
[22:43:56] <primitivMedia> ?
[22:49:16] <pavonia> That targets any a.js-remove-list-item element that has an ancestor which is not of class twitter
[22:58:34] <pavonia> Always a pleasure to help when people are like that :/
