[02:10:04] <oik> im using PeerJS trying to make a one to many connections, i want to, remove streams from receivers when local close the cam. Anyone who can help me with PeerJS
[13:39:16] <rbo> trying to utilize this piece of code, I have https://gist.github.com/thunatos/75d760a3525bdcbdaff1012ba35bdeca and trying to change the contents of button.find('.far fa-heart').addClass9'.fas.fa-heart') but for some reason that piece of code never changes.
[13:56:58] <shoky_> rbo dont use dots in addClass()  it's not a css selector
[17:56:00] <rbo> hey, I asked a question earlier, sorry my irc client timed out.
[17:56:27] <rbo> basically the HTML isn't changing when I click a button here: https://gist.github.com/thunatos/75d760a3525bdcbdaff1012ba35bdeca the html is the spam class listed.
[17:56:53] <rbo> should be easy, I am just not finding a solution.
[17:57:56] <rbo> ohh I think I see the issue.

[18:02:24] <rbo> hmmm. nope
[18:09:14] <rbo> I'm totally stumped. even running $(this).find($('.far fa-heart')).removeClass('.far fa-heart').addClass('.fas fa-heart'); doesn't change it also.
[18:12:33] <rbo> ok, well just calling `button.removeClass` and `button.addClass` works
[20:43:03] <physikoi> Hi #jquery. It seems that `$("form").serialize()` does not include the form name, or am I doing something wrong? This is the way I'm doing it now, but I'm wondering if there's a better way.: https://pastebin.com/raw/StLQDBeG
[20:52:29] <shoky_> physikoi: form names are not something that is used really. no reason for serialize() to add it
[20:52:45] <shoky_> it serializes the same things that a regular form submit would, more or less
[20:58:35] <physikoi> i guess you mean aside from targeting. but i hear ya. I probably just need to rethink how I'm handling forms in the first place
[23:32:57] <robertmaxrees> rbo fwiw your code had a few issues about selectors and the like.
[23:33:27] <robertmaxrees> for starters, your .find() was off - I think you wanted $(this).find('.far .fa-heart')
[23:33:35] <robertmaxrees> if .fa-heart is a child of .far, that is.
