[01:14:09] <hellyeah> hmm
[01:14:16] <hellyeah> jquery 3.0.0 is on the way huh
[01:16:42] <mdev> hope they don't strip more features
[01:17:24] <hellyeah> strip?
[01:17:29] <hellyeah> what did you strip?
[01:18:15] <mdev> i'm sure lot of things, one of which that comes to mind is browser detection code they had, but I was more referring to
[01:18:26] <mdev> jQuery 2.x has the same API as jQuery 1.x, but does not support Internet Explorer 6, 7, or 8
[01:18:52] <mdev> cool let's go down that slippery slope!
[02:00:03] <hellyeah> anyone around_
[02:00:14] <hellyeah> how can move "ok" to the titlebar http://jsfiddle.net/tyhctecq/3/
[02:23:11] <hellyeah> hey anyone around

[02:30:43] <hellyeah> humm
[02:30:52] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/tyhctecq/6/
[02:31:12] <hellyeah> this should work
[02:31:36] <hellyeah> or try this http://jsfiddle.net/tyhctecq/7/
[02:31:40] <hellyeah> what is console told you
[02:31:44] <hellyeah> it worked on my side
[02:31:58] <AcidBeard> event is not defined
[02:32:22] <hellyeah> everything works fine here :D
[02:32:48] <hellyeah> i dunno what can i say :D
[02:36:36] <AcidBeard> I have gotten in a lot of trouble for saying that to my boss.  >_>
[02:36:38] <AcidBeard> LOL
[02:37:04] <hellyeah> can be browser issue
[02:37:42] <AcidBeard> What are you using?
[02:39:35] <AcidBeard> Works in chrome
[02:40:40] <AcidBeard> So you want this: in the title bar? Button lara tıklayarak renkli alanları animasyonlu bir hale gtirebilirsiniz. Renkleri eşleştitrken butonun yanında ki yazının rengine göre seçimi yapabilirsiniz.
[02:40:44] <hellyeah> chrome
[02:41:07] <AcidBeard> Or do you want the icon to show in the title bar?
[02:41:13] <hellyeah> you open this by clicking image button
[02:41:25] <hellyeah> yeah hand icon in the titlebar
[02:44:53] <AcidBeard> $("link[rel=icon]").attr("href","http://i.imgur.com/2yuQih2.png");
[02:45:07] <AcidBeard> That'll update the favicon
[02:46:09] <hellyeah> why do we update favicon?
[02:46:30] <AcidBeard> That's the icon in the title bar
[02:46:50] <AcidBeard> ..or am I missing something?
[02:47:05] <hellyeah> actually i put close icon myself to the title bar
[02:47:24] <hellyeah> i have a button which pop up another pop up window
[02:47:32] <AcidBeard> You mean the title bar of the pop up window or the <title>Title Bar</title>
[02:47:33] <hellyeah> i want to move that image button to the title bar
[02:47:41] <AcidBeard> Ohhh
[02:47:45] <hellyeah> .ui-dialog-tit
[02:47:47] <hellyeah> .ui-dialog-title
[02:48:03] <hellyeah> i want to move image button to the ui-dialog-title
[02:48:30] <hellyeah> i can save some space
[02:51:39] <JZA> I want to get an XML parsing in a cascading fashion, so that the children nodes are under the parent node.
[02:52:18] <JZA> atm i only get a whole page, and I cant seem to organize it as different table blocks.
[02:52:20] <JZA> http://jsfiddle.net/8mxbju5b/
[02:52:28] <JZA> here is some code of the XML parse through JQuery
[02:52:53] <JZA> my issue is that find() gets everything on the XML and I need to do partial retrievals through aloop.
[02:53:10] <AcidBeard> hellyeah: Sorry, I'm not very familure with jQuery UI, but using .find may get you going in the right direction
[02:57:02] <codedecay> what are you trying to retrieve JZA
[02:57:57] <JZA> is more about presenting the xml in the right fashion
[02:58:50] <JZA> should be <h2>Route Title <span> $232</span></h2> <table> destination1, 2,3,...</table> <h2>Route Title2.... etc
[02:59:20] <JZA> instead I get 1 huge table with all the destinations, and AFTER I get the titles, even if in the code the titles are output first
[02:59:24] <JZA> and then the routes.
[02:59:59] <JZA> so 2 things, 1: getting the titles to display before the desintations, and 2nd getting the monolitical table to be intercalated with the title criteria.
[03:01:15] <neruda> im struggling to get autocomplete select function to insert selected value into another dynamically created input field, please help: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7937c8db70a24835cab6
[03:01:49] <neruda> logging to console shows selector is correct cant imagine why its not working, new field appears blank though
[03:03:10] <hellyeah> thank you
[03:07:41] <tokam> has anyone yet worked with this plugin? https://vox.space/files/jquery/classybox/
[03:07:47] <tokam> I do not get how to group images.
[03:28:29] <tokam> I am having issues with this website. If you click on the image above the text Tudaz I see 2/6 i the light box but I only have 5 images.

[04:34:33] <cyberbrai> How to give image source in corenerStone
[04:34:40] <cyberbrai> anyone know
[06:44:56] <Whirled> good morning all
[07:21:06] <kegster> If I have an illustration that's large, is there a way to navigate around the image by zooming in and roating around, etc (like prezi.com) ?
[09:00:59] <serses> i have a problem with Jquery.If i hover on Test 3 first subtab it doesn't get updated even if i'm hovering over it : https://jsbin.com/vubujojezo/edit?html,css,js,output
[09:08:03] <arc_> for some reason if you hover it does nothing, but if you hover and then move to another .subtab it updates
[09:08:51] <arc_> but only on test3
[09:10:04] <serses> yes
[09:10:26] <arc_> that makes me think it's an html error but i don't see any
[09:10:37] <serses> i mean it works for the first 2 tabs
[09:10:51] <serses> but on the 3rd when i try to hover on the first subtab it does nothing
[09:10:59] <serses> even if the color changes
[09:11:36] <arc_> actually
[09:11:51] <serses> it doesn't update the ul below only if i move to far left
[09:12:14] <arc_> test1 and test2 behave the same. the difference is that you have to move outside the element to hover over .subtab for test3
[09:12:46] <arc_> if you change to test2 and go around the outside, it will do the samet hing
[09:12:48] <serses> yes
[09:13:52] <serses> but on test 3 i can update only if i move far left from the element
[09:18:12] <arc_> is this updating your page when i change it o_O
[09:18:22] <serses> it was me
[09:18:23] <serses> sorry
[09:18:40] <arc_> it's fine, i'm just wondering if you're seeing what i'm doing
[09:19:11] <serses> nope
[09:19:15] <arc_> okay
[09:19:45] <arc_> yeah idk this is pretty strange
[09:22:13] <neruda> hi struggingling with autocomplete's select callback, it wont populate a dynamically created input: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7937c8db70a24835cab6
[09:22:22] <neruda> any help appreciated
[09:22:57] <neruda> field is created but remains blank even though logs show both field selector and ui.item.value are both set correctly
[09:46:20] <kegster> Has anyone taken a large scale vector and moved around on a div or something (canvas maybe?) like a presentation sort of? like prezi.com? If so or not, how could I achieve this? Is there a simple way or what not? Basically I could just focus on certain spot for step 1, then step 2 transitions by zooming out and over and rotating to another part of the large SVG
[10:22:57] <fofaf> hello
[10:23:11] <fofaf> how can i add itemprop property to an image added my jquery backdrop?
[10:27:41] <shoky_> neruda: what part exactly is not working? can you make a jsfiddle
[10:43:50] <neruda> shoky_: the dynamically created input appears so I know the select function is executing, but the ui.item.value does NOT appear as the the value of the new field
[10:47:05] <shoky_> neruda: by new field i am guessing you mean newSelectedOffenseRow.. but where are you setting this new field's value?
[10:51:31] <shoky_> neruda: also how you're building this selector seems off..  "#header[offense]["+selectedOffenseFormFieldIndex+"][charge]"
[10:51:48] <shoky_> id's should be unique
[10:52:20] <shoky_> and number attributes are weird, if not invalid
[10:57:20] <printForever> can I do this... someVariable = document.createElement('ul').setAttribute('id', 'thisIsId');
[11:00:46] <shoky_> printForever: you can do it, but setAttribute returns undefined so it won't be very useful. but with jquery you can do  someVariable = $('<ul>').attr('id','thisIsId');
[11:01:13] <printForever> shoky_: should I do it in two rows?
[11:01:29] <printForever> I'm confused, because phpStorm is telling me that I'm duplicating the variable
[11:01:47] <printForever> iKnow I'm duplicating it... I need to assign the bloody ID
[11:02:07] <shoky_> printForever:  var someVariable = document.createElement('ul');  someVariable.setAttribute('id', 'thisIsId');
[11:02:09] <printForever> and you're right about undefined, that's why I came here to ask
[11:02:29] <printForever> yup, thats how I wrote it first time around
[11:02:42] <printForever> and before checking it, I got a message from phpStorm that I'm duplicating it...
[11:02:55] <printForever> that... phpFuokStorm
[11:03:32] <shoky_> doesn't sound like it had to do with the setAttribute call
[11:03:43] <printForever> it did...
[11:03:47] <printForever> thanks!
[11:04:16] <printForever> aaaa now I get it
[11:04:21] <printForever> I separated them by comma
[11:04:26] <printForever> thats why it appeared as duplicated
[11:04:29] <printForever> ugh
[11:05:43] <neruda> shoky_: id's are all unique when i run it, indexes are because its part of a complex/nested form hash
[11:06:31] <neruda> shoky_: im using rails and the id's are based on the form builder convention (simple_form)
[11:08:37] <printForever> NotFoundError: DOM Exception 8: An attempt was made to reference a Node in a context where it does not exist.
[11:09:02] <printForever> I created the element, I assigned the ID and when I want to appendChild to it, I get this
[11:11:31] <printForever> what am I doing wrong?
[11:13:40] <shoky_> neruda: well, can't really help you without seeing what's actually happening and what element you're setting the value of. in your code nothing shows that you're setting the value of that new field
[11:20:36] <shoky_> printForever: show your code
[11:21:02] <printForever> shoky_: I'm trying to do this one on my own
[11:21:25] <printForever> but logically thinking
[11:21:51] <printForever> I have DIV with ID, and I want to append UL to it, then I want to add LI elements to UL.
[11:21:56] <DeltaHeavy> printForever: Yeah but if you want some help, you need to show us the relevent code else we can't really understand your issue.
[11:22:24] <printForever> DeltaHeavy: correct, I just wanted to think out loud first, so you can tell me that I suck
[11:22:28] <printForever> :)
[11:22:35] <DeltaHeavy> printForever: Ok, gotcha ;3
[11:22:49] <printForever> so my idea was, to getElementByID and find that DIV
[11:23:16] <printForever> after that I createElement('ul'), assign ID to it (because of styling), and save it as variable
[11:23:57] <printForever> then, I go in the loop FOR each LI element, and at the end of the loop, I appendChild LI to UL
[11:24:19] <printForever> and in the last step, I append the UL variable (now with all the LI's) to the DIV
[11:24:40] <printForever> and... somehow... it goes fine until it needs to appendChild LI to UL variable
[11:25:04] <printForever> wait, is that the problem? I'm trying to append InnerHTML to variable?!
[11:25:31] <printForever> shoky_ and DeltaHeavy :)
[11:25:48] <shoky_> yes? want us to tell you you suck again?
[11:26:02] <printForever> :D and provide some sort of explanation
[11:26:05] <printForever> what I did wrong
[11:26:10] <shoky_> we have no idea what you did
[11:26:19] <printForever> but I just explained it all
[11:26:20] <DeltaHeavy> printForever: This is #jquery. You might want to ask your question in ##javascript if you want to go about it that way though if you want to do it the #jquery way that'd be MUCH easier.
[11:26:26] <shoky_> your explanation is not what you did
[11:26:31] <DeltaHeavy> I get what he's trying to explain.
[11:26:45] <shoky_> the error you're getting is about your code, not your explanation
[11:26:55] <shoky_> think logically, yes?
[11:27:36] <printForever> let me make fiddle
[11:27:47] <DeltaHeavy> shoky_: I think he gets that. I think he's trying to figure out what he's doing wrong.
[11:27:56] <DeltaHeavy> printForever: Why aren't you using jQuery to do this sorta stuff?
[11:27:58] <shoky_> then he shouldn't highlight us
[11:28:05] <shoky_> if he doesn't want our help
[11:28:18] <shoky_> but he's making a fiddle, so all is well
[11:28:27] <DeltaHeavy> shoky_: He wants help, he just wanted to explain it a bit before us butting in.
[11:28:34] <printForever> I wanted to learn the basics... I'm OK with jQuery, but I wanted to do it like in the good ol days
[11:28:36] <DeltaHeavy> Chill yo beanz dwag
[11:28:50] <printForever> yeah
[11:29:02] <DeltaHeavy> printForever: Ain't nothing wrong wiht that. Such questions may be better suited to ##javascript though I'm more than happy to help here.
[11:29:09] <printForever> I thought if I explain my logic it would help me realize where I fuoked up
[11:29:16] <printForever> right on
[11:29:19] <shoky_> but who said your logic is where you fucked up
[11:29:33] <shoky_> your exdplanation seems fine
[11:30:02] <ashgotti> Hello all. I need a bit of help with a simple bit of code. http://pastebin.com/9BPw5VG6 I have select field that I want to use as a basis for populating one of two fields. It works but the problem is if user selects option A to populate field A, it does it but if they choose their selection to option B, it populates field B but field A obviously is still populated. How do I undo the first population?
[11:34:10] <printForever> http://pastebin.com/m4nnCdN9
[11:34:41] <printForever> the data for showSomeThing is being served from PHP...
[11:35:12] <shoky_> printForever:  yes the problem is you're calling appendChild with an html string instead of a dom node
[11:35:26] <printForever> Oh! I was right?! :)
[11:35:29] <printForever> what do I get?
[11:35:36] <printForever> did I won anything? prize? :D
[11:35:49] <printForever> how do I correctly append it?
[11:37:38] <shoky_> you can create the li with createElement and set its .innerHTML, or  build an html string and set the ul's innerHTML,  or just create all those elements with createElement :P
[11:38:10] <shoky_> you can only .appendChild a dom node, e.g. something created with createElement, like you correctly did with adding the ul to the div
[11:40:47] <shoky_> ideally you'd be using some templating library
[11:44:04] <printForever> right, understood
[11:44:10] <printForever> I'm getting better
[11:45:52] <DeltaHeavy> Depends on what you're doing. Often a templating library is overkill.
[11:55:11] <printForever> I'm using createElement to create the LI and then I will add innerHTML to it, which would then allow me to go through all of them and populate UL
[11:55:25] <printForever> which will in the end populate the DIV
[12:02:20] <ashgotti> Can $(this) refer to two different elements if they're nested? I.E I have an event attached to a dropbox so in the function $(this) refers to that, but then I have an .each on another element within that function, can I set $(this) to apply to the other element in the .each?
[12:02:48] <ashgotti> You can see the sample code here http://pastebin.com/9BPw5VG6
[12:03:21] <ashgotti> I could have sworn it was working 5 min ago (maybe time to walk away from it today) and now it just returns my select element, not the element in the .each
[12:11:56] <ashgotti> I'm so stupid..I was completing the wrong field.
[12:27:00] <krebbit> hello everyone
[12:27:29] <krebbit> I runned into a big problem, not sure whats the best solution to this but let me explain the situation
[12:28:12] <krebbit> i have a tab plugin so when somone clicks on it it display contant automatically. Problem is the the content does not have the same length.
[12:29:02] <krebbit> so when somone clicks on tab 3 lets say, and then goes to tab 5 , the content on tab5  does not start from the top but more like in the middle
[12:29:13] <krebbit> does anyone know how to fix this ?
[12:29:53] <printForever> krebbit: use CSS to set the same lenght
[12:30:08] <krebbit> how can i do this, could you help ?
[12:30:50] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody in and around Toronto Ontario?
[12:47:57] <printForever> krebbit, well, you need to set the correct width to the tabs
[12:48:36] <DeltaHeavy> You shouldn't use JS for that.
[12:48:50] <DeltaHeavy> display: table; table-layout: fixed       then on the children    display: table-cell
[12:48:52] <DeltaHeavy> anyway brb
[12:50:20] <krebbit> yeah i actuall was able to solve this by inserting anchor tag  so like this <li><a href="#a">category5</a></li>
[12:50:34] <krebbit> now all the tabs work fine and goes to the tab
[12:50:39] <krebbit> there is another problem
[12:50:49] <krebbit> same problem but not the same
[12:51:28] <krebbit>   <li><a href="#hey" class="navTo">HOME</a></li>
[12:51:52] <krebbit> then i have another one like this but with different href atribute
[12:52:16] <krebbit> so now when i navigate from one page to another the content does not start from the top
[12:52:34] <krebbit> but more like when the page was being set up before
[12:52:53] <krebbit> im using <section> if that helps
[13:25:39] <krebbit> hello im stilling having the same problem, could someone help somehow fix this issue ? Thank YOU
[14:04:50] <fission6> how do i hide one field if another field/dropdown has a certain value selected?
[14:41:36] <JZA> hi I need help trying to make this loop work
[14:44:50] <arthurvr> JZA: which one?
[14:45:46] <JZA> I need to iterate through an xml and present headings and tables. The headings work without an issue, but Jquery dumps everying on a single table.
[14:46:02] <JZA> I would create the table inside of the subloop but then I am having issues with the AppendTo
[15:50:12] <haroldjfks> hello, in a span id "total_price" there is eg. £48.97 ...i need to get it, replace £ with euro and do a math with the number only... so var text = $('#total_price').text(); BUT then ? thanks
[15:53:22] <haroldjfks> anyone here, please?
[15:56:14] <JZA> yeah
[15:56:34] <JZA> .get()
[15:57:47] <JZA> http://api.jquery.com/replacewith/
[15:59:04] <haroldjfks> JZA: i need to replace the £ sign only.. not everything
[15:59:40] <haroldjfks> and do a math with 48.97
[16:00:39] <JZA> dunno. JQuery surf the DOM, not really deal with strings.
[16:01:00] <JZA> but you could do it with Javascript and just replaceWith()
[16:01:04] <haroldjfks> and also, the result goes into another div...but that is not a problem, the problem is to get the number only
[16:01:47] <haroldjfks> how to get 48.97 only?
[16:19:44] <shoky_> haroldjfks: text.slice(1)
[16:24:08] <haroldjfks> I did it with this: var sd = $('#total_price_carta').text(); AND var number = Number(sd.replace(/[^0-9\.]+/g,""));
[17:36:48] <grill> yo
[17:36:56] <grill> how do you guys usually handle touch events?
[17:42:07] <rcyr> Awkwardly.
[17:51:50] <Whirled>  lol @rcyr
[17:52:27] <rcyr> :)
[17:52:44] <grill> tru
[18:53:30] <pantsofchocolate> i for the life of me cant remember something, whats the proper way to write the jquery selector for an object that will be replaced by ajax, so like a select field named test
[19:28:54] <ICA> anyone up? i donate a beer :D
[19:30:34] <Crucials> ill accept a beer
[19:32:58] <ICA> Crucials: you mind helping me adding the toggle-function of http://jillix.github.io/jQuery-sidebar/ from bottom to 75% of width - then ill spend even a shot
[19:33:00] <ICA> :)
[19:36:10] <Crucials> hard to say, would have to look at the code somewhere i suppose
[19:36:54] <Crucials> seems to be a static width though
[19:36:58] <Crucials> so you should be able to mess with that
[19:37:10] <Crucials> look for somewhere that says "270"
[19:37:14] <Crucials> might be your first clue
[19:37:39] <ICA> im not pretty good in tagging - time to learn - i do project manamgement
[19:38:18] <ICA> question is, i would like to add a tag into an img src
[19:38:26] <ICA> so you click on a img, and then the sidebar opens
[19:42:19] <gambl0re> which is better flickr or 500px
[19:55:32] <Whirled> ICA, did you get your question answered?
[19:55:43] <ICA> no sir
[19:56:08] <Whirled> So you just want to open an already defined sidebar when you click an image, correct?
[19:56:11] <ICA> trying to get it done- if you want to join me it would be pretty nice ^^
[19:56:32] <ICA> i am about to insert code first
[19:56:40] <ICA> and then make the sidebar open when you press on logo
[19:56:54] <ICA> then i will try to add an irc webclient into sidebar / for visitors
[19:56:58] <ICA> thats the goal
[19:56:59] <ICA> = )
[19:57:08] <Whirled> Now that's trickier. LOL
[19:57:14] <ICA> :D
[19:57:20] <ICA> i am pretty ambitious person

[20:00:51] <Whirled> bah. that sidebar script needs some work. it should be using CSS transitions rather than animate...maybe fallback to animate.

[20:03:02] <ICA> http://jillix.github.io/jQuery-sidebar/ ?
[20:26:36] <ICA> Whirled

[20:27:33] <ICA> i dont know how to add the trigger into a img
[20:27:40] <ICA> -    <img src="/logo.png" class="sidebar bottom">
[20:27:49] <ICA> whats wrong?
[20:29:08] <Whirled> $(
[20:29:30] <Whirled> you are getting the sidebar confused with the button to open it.
[20:29:38] <Whirled> the image isn't the sidebar
[20:34:11] <ICA> im a little further
[20:34:13] <ICA> ^^

[21:39:35] <Whirled> definitely could be done better, but it doesn't extend the jquery namespace, and uses css for hw acceleration.
[21:47:06] <ISmithers> Hi all, I am using jQuery to animate a button hover state. I'm doing it by adding my hover state styles to a class, and using .toggleClass to translate between them.
[21:47:19] <ISmithers> Found that solution online, and it works - except for nested elements.
[21:47:49] <Whirled> and except for touch-based interfaces
[21:47:55] <Whirled> that don't have :hover
[21:48:04] <ISmithers> They don't have hover states, so that is a non-issue.
[21:48:15] <ISmithers> Yeah. So there isn't a problem there is there, unless I'm missing something?
[21:48:49] <Whirled> When desigining UI, it's generally not a good idea to rule out the single larges and fastest growing interface
[21:48:53] <Whirled> but it's your code
[21:49:03] <ISmithers> What do you mean, its not ruled out?
[21:49:31] <ISmithers> There are styles applied for mobile controls, specifically for that platform.
[21:49:35] <Whirled> have you tried the :hover pseudo class in css?
[21:49:45] <ISmithers> Anyway...
[21:49:56] <ISmithers> I can translate styles smoothly on the parent element that has the class change applied to it, but how do I handle compound changes.
[21:50:25] <ISmithers> ie For a li > a > span. The css just snaps into being, rather than smoothly animates via jquery toggleClass like on the parent element.
[21:50:38] <Whirled> You will have to paste your code to jsfiddle and setup a working example.
[21:50:58] <ISmithers> Its fine, I'll work it out myself. Probably quicker.
[21:51:05] <Whirled> whatever
