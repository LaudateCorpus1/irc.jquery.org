[00:01:21] <djam90> How do you balance the need for code to be seperated to page specific code, along with the need for minify and concat to speed up the website? If I concat and minify then it can break some pages if certain things like Dropzone are not present on all those pages. How do you guys handle this?
[00:12:00] <YamakasY> morning guys
[00:12:26] <YamakasY> is it true I cannot call the jquery lib for domain.tld from static.domain.tld ?
[00:12:36] <YamakasY> because of relative paths ?
[00:15:32] <Cork> YamakasY: uh, what?
[00:15:44] <Cork> if you mean load the resource, the sure you can
[00:15:54] <Cork> if you mean something else; you need to rephrase it
[00:19:41] <YamakasY> relative path issue ?
[00:21:43] <dddh> YamakasY: jsonp or cross-domain?
[00:23:34] <YamakasY> dddh, crossdomain
[00:26:05] <Cork> YamakasY: loading jquery isn't limited by cross domain
[00:26:15] <Cork> YamakasY: again you need to rephrase the question
[00:28:54] <YamakasY> Cork, I thought the same, but we have issues with it
[00:30:29] <Cork> YamakasY: again can you rephrase the question?
[00:30:46] <Cork> its too ambiguous and too little info to answer
[00:31:06] <Cork> YamakasY: before you do you can't get help
[00:31:44] <Cork> YamakasY: only answer i can give that doesn't assume a tone is "possibly"
[00:32:49] <YamakasY> Cork, I know, testing out atm realtime debuggin ;)
[00:33:31] <Cork> YamakasY: why are you asking question if you don't want to get an answer?
[00:33:48] <YamakasY> Cork, just a sec, I cannot multitask I´m a guy ;0
[00:34:11] <YamakasY> we can change it but our ajax request needs to be changed all than
[00:34:33] <Cork> ook so the question is about ajax and not jquery loading?
[00:35:01] <Cork> *sigh* i will ignore your question until you share enough info to actually know what the f* you have problem with...
[00:35:46] <tinix> hi, can someone help with this? i'm having trouble binding to some dynamically created content: http://jsfiddle.net/rced7kp1/
[00:35:47] <YamakasY> Cork, you are free to respond or not :)
[00:36:07] <Cork> YamakasY: please stop waisting ppls time...
[00:36:25] <YamakasY> Cork, I don´t a question is a question, it can be asked
[00:36:33] <YamakasY> we see something else atm, can happen
[00:36:48] <Cork> YamakasY: "i have a problem what is the cause" IS waisting ppls time
[00:37:13] <Cork> don't ask if you don't intend to fill in the area of what is problematic
[00:37:22] <YamakasY> Cork, I didn´t hear other ones complain, so be nice
[00:37:29] <Lebbe_> I complain
[00:37:38] <Lebbe_> you need to flesh out your question
[00:37:38] <YamakasY> Lebbe_, you cannot as I send you beer ;)
[00:38:02] <Lebbe_> what do you mean when you write "call the jquery"? it doesn't make sense
[00:38:08] <YamakasY> yes as we see soemthing else happening atm I cannot I said, but Cork doesn´t see that
[00:38:26] <Cork> * YamakasY!*@* added to ignore list.
[00:38:28] <YamakasY> all our calls do /js/foo/bla.js
[00:38:32] <Lebbe_> are you using google translate?
[00:38:43] <YamakasY> nope
[00:38:45] <tinix> jquery's phone number is 555-java obviously, and he's calling them lol
[00:38:51] <Xatenev> Cork: :D haha
[00:39:07] <Xatenev> people keep pissing you off these days whoa Cork? :P
[00:39:08] <Cork> man i can't stand inconsiderate idiots
[00:39:23] <YamakasY> the fun is Cork will never win as I have a bouncher so change names or whatever
[00:39:24] <mooncup> I just can't stand idiots full-stop
[00:39:29] <Cork> the last few days ppl things everyone is there for there sake
[00:39:43] <YamakasY> Cork, no, you think that way
[00:39:46] <Xatenev> Yea followed the chat
[00:39:48] <Cork> i'm here to help, not your personal slave
[00:40:01] <YamakasY> hehe, did I claim you ? no
[00:40:04] <Xatenev> YamakasY: just try to ask a question in the way as you would write on SO without being downvoted
[00:40:05] <Xatenev> :D
[00:40:28] <YamakasY> Xatenev, as I said, I cannot ask further atm as we see something else
[00:40:36] <tinix> so can someone help with this? http://jsfiddle.net/rced7kp1/ it seems so trivial… there must be something simple i'm missing. :(
[00:40:39] <YamakasY> so please stop asking me to ask further!
[00:40:50] <Cork> tinix: what event handler?
[00:41:08] <Cork> tinix: also don't prefix ids with tag names
[00:41:16] <Lebbe_> YamakasY: if your jquery files is on static.domain.com and you want to use them on an html page in domain.com you have to write out the whole domain in the <script> tag's href-attribute
[00:41:17] <Cork> your slowing down the selector for no good reason
[00:41:32] <Lebbe_> like href="http://static.domain.com/jquery.js"
[00:41:41] <Lebbe_> not href="jquery.js"
[00:41:50] <tinix> okay fair enough, but that's not the issue. and there's only one table on the page i'm working with anyway, so it's irrellevant
[00:42:00] <YamakasY> Lebbe_, yap merci
[00:42:09] <tinix> thanks for the tip though
[00:42:18] <Cork> tinix: that was an *also* please answer the question
[00:42:40] <tinix> what do you mean?
[00:42:45] <Cork> tinix: what event handler? <--
[00:43:00] <Cork> you have a few in there witch one isn't working for you?
[00:43:06] <tinix> can't you read the code? "hidden"
[00:43:12] <tinix> it has a commnt
[00:43:17] <tinix> saying it doesn't work
[00:43:24] <tinix> line 33
[00:44:18] <Cork> so editable fire hidden events?
[00:45:15] <tinix> yes
[00:45:36] <tinix> it works on the first static row that is there at page-load
[00:46:38] <Cork> tinix: bootstrap editable uses triggerHandler
[00:46:43] <Cork> those event doesn't bubble
[00:46:49] <Cork> so you can't delegate the event handler
[00:47:11] <tinix> ahh
[00:47:12] <tinix> hmm
[00:47:57] <Cork> tinix: http://api.jquery.com/triggerhandler/
[00:48:05] <Cork> third point in the bullet list
[00:48:15] <tinix> yes
[00:48:39] <Cork> not sure why they use triggerHandler instead of trigger
[00:48:59] <Cork> sounds like a silly restriction to me
[00:49:19] <Cork> (and causes inconsistency)
[00:49:23] <tinix> https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/5318
[00:49:25] <tinix> :)
[00:49:26] <tinix> blah
[00:49:34] <tinix> so backwards
[00:49:37] <tinix> i agree
[00:50:03] <Cork> uh
[00:50:23] <Cork> in those cases you prefix the event, not preventing delegation -_-'
[00:52:11] <tinix> i wonder if thre's some other event i can hijack, hmm. something hacky like set a global variable, then use that to know whether i've bound an event alrady, and then use something like keypress to bind the hidden event once.
[00:52:42] <Cork> most likely no
[00:52:43] <tinix> or is there another way to know when an element is removed from the DOM?
[00:52:56] <Cork> not cross browser
[00:53:05] <tinix> i only need to support chrome
[00:53:08] <Cork> MutationObservers can do in
[00:53:15] <tinix> and webkit
[00:53:18] <Cork> but it is quite new and far from cross browser
[00:53:20] <tinix> safari etc
[00:53:26] <Cork> ?g mdn mutationobserver
[00:53:28] <b-ot> Cork: MutationObserver - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[00:53:47] <Cork> tinix: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver#Browser_compatibility
[00:53:57] <Cork> so chrome 26+ and safari 6+
[00:54:28] <Cork> hmm that is actually starting to be feasible cross browser!
[00:54:34] <Cork> only ie11 is a bit tight
[00:57:05] <Uhkis> we want sparta!
[01:07:56] <tinix> so i ended up just patching x-editable js to use trigger() instead of triggerhandler() for that even that i need to hook.
[01:08:02] <tinix> it works :)
[01:08:07] <tinix> thanks for the help!
[01:18:48] <ThoMe> hiho
[01:18:51] <ThoMe> good morning?
[01:18:58] <Uhkis> good day
[01:19:31] <ThoMe> i would like open a dialog (ui) when in the url url.de/blub/group.php#addGroup
[01:19:41] <ThoMe> how i can check if #addGroup in the url?
[01:19:52] <Cork> window.location.hash
[01:21:38] <ThoMe> ah, easy. thank your Mr. Cork :)
[01:21:52] <Cork> heh np (no need for the mr ;) )
[01:22:03] <ThoMe> :P
[01:22:11] <Uhkis> your highness better? :-)
[01:22:15] <Cork> lol
[01:24:16] <DRSK> http://wpbin.io/g8h3o0 what downsides are there besides <= IE9 won't work?
[01:24:45] <ThoMe> Cork: emm. and when i two times click to group.php#addGroup ?
[01:24:49] <ThoMe> works only one times.
[01:25:09] <Cork> ThoMe: the second doesn't cause a reload
[01:25:11] <ThoMe> when i load my page.
[01:25:16] <Cork> as it is taken as a hashchange
[01:25:19] <Cork> there is an event for that
[01:25:22] <ThoMe> hm. ok
[01:25:23] <Cork> ?g mdn hashchange
[01:25:25] <b-ot> Cork: WindowEventHandlers.onhashchange - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers.onhashchange
[01:26:01] <Cork> ThoMe: you might want to use a query instead
[01:26:09] <Cork> ?dialog=addGroup
[01:26:14] <ThoMe> hm. ok.
[01:26:21] <ThoMe> and how i can get this varaible? :-)
[01:26:22] <ThoMe> in jquery?
[01:26:41] <ThoMe> example groups.php?todo=addGroup
[01:26:49] <Cork> window.location.search
[01:27:10] <Cork> you would have to parse the query string though
[01:27:29] <Cork> and core jquery doesn't provide any helping functions for that
[01:27:36] <Cork> there are several plugins though (if you need it)
[01:34:38] <pothepanda> hello
[01:40:09] <pothepanda> this guy in try.jquery.com speaks like a robot. anyone else had the same feeling ?
[01:41:25] <Uhkis> so what?
[01:43:14] <pothepanda> nothing its just kind of strange at the beginning
[01:43:33] <pothepanda> Uhkis: is it you ? :D
[01:43:49] <Uhkis> lol no :)
[01:52:12] <DRSK> Cork » any chance you could provide some feedback on that gist/paste thingy regarding *detection*?
[01:52:37] <Cork> DRSK: you would have to reask the question
[01:52:38] <DRSK> Basically I don't care about IE<9 but I was wondering if there are any other downsides or issues with it
[01:52:44] <DRSK> http://wpbin.io/g8h3o0
[01:53:03] <Cork> ah
[01:53:29] <Lebbe> is there a way i can make jquery "understand" a ordinary javascript object as representing a DOM node or selector?
[01:53:33] <Cork> media queries
[01:53:54] <Lebbe> like $({magicfield: selectorOrDomNode})
[01:54:09] <Cork> DRSK: that is what those calls was meant for
[01:54:11] <DRSK> Maybe I should check for window.matchMedia first, and if that exists I'd go with it, if not fallback onto user agent sniffing thingy to "make sure" we're covered?
[01:54:15] <Cork> not sure what the question is
[01:54:28] <Cork> if they aren't supported, then ya that is a problem
[01:54:40] <Cork> but there isn't really much other that can cause a problem
[01:54:41] <DRSK> Well, I need to know if the user is on a device and/or small screen and I was hoping those two vars could help me out
[01:55:04] <Cork> Lebbe: you mean like $(node) ?
[01:55:26] <DRSK> Ah, how do I make a quick check if window.matchMedia is a "thing"? document.createElement something, I can't recall really :p
[01:55:32] <Cork> DRSK: yes like i said, that is what they are for
[01:55:48] <Lebbe> Cork: well the problem is that we use $(foo) many places in codebase, where foo is a dom node
[01:56:15] <Lebbe> but we also overload foo with properties, which we shouldnt, because that is really bad practice
[01:56:41] <Lebbe> so no foo is just a ordinary javascript object, but code who does $(foo) doesnt work
[01:56:59] <Lebbe> i was thinking about doing something like this, but this is hurting my eyes
[01:57:11] <Lebbe> http://jsfiddle.net/lebbe/x12b9cvd/1/
[01:57:38] <Lebbe> where the field .tlxNode is the DOM Node
[01:58:09] <Lebbe> it also crashes with the widget factory, when it tries to extend $ etc
[01:59:28] <Cork> Lebbe: uh why?
[01:59:32] <Lebbe> well
[01:59:39] <Cork> just do $(foo.flxNode, foo)
[01:59:46] <Lebbe> no
[02:00:01] <Lebbe> because we have $(foo) thousands of places in our code
[02:00:07] <Lebbe> and $(selector, foo) etc
[02:00:09] <Cork> oook?
[02:00:23] <Cork> ok backup what are you trying to do?
[02:00:26] <Lebbe> and at the same time overload foo with property fields
[02:00:31] <Cork> why do you want to replace foo with an object?
[02:00:47] <Lebbe> and at the same time overload foo with property fields
[02:00:53] <Cork> why do you want to replace foo with an object?
[02:01:00] <Lebbe> and at the same time overload foo with property fields
[02:01:10] <Cork> that isn't an answer
[02:01:13] <Lebbe> well
[02:01:18] <Cork> its a solution you picked
[02:01:22] <Cork> nit why
[02:01:28] <Cork> *not
[02:01:30] <Lebbe> because I dont wont these devs working here overwriting the DOM Node API all the time
[02:01:39] <Lebbe> causing bugs that are difficult to chase
[02:01:52] <Cork> again what are you trying to do?
[02:01:53] <Lebbe> I find code like
[02:01:59] <Lebbe> foo.remove = function() {}
[02:02:12] <Cork> $(foo).data('remove', function() {})
[02:02:16] <Lebbe> and then $(foo).appendBefore other places
[02:02:35] <Cork> no need to reinvent the weal
[02:02:43] <Lebbe> Cork: I dont think you understand that I am trying to refactor ten thousands of lines of codes in hundreds of web pages
[02:02:43] <Uhkis> or the wheel!
[02:02:56] <Lebbe> that are badly written
[02:03:25] <Cork> Lebbe: so somethign is already expecting the node.remove() code to work?
[02:03:30] <Lebbe> because they use a dom node as a javascript object
[02:03:37] <Lebbe> all over
[02:03:44] <Lebbe> it is their "framework"
[02:03:52] <Cork> that sucks kinda badly...
[02:03:55] <Lebbe> yes
[02:04:30] <Lebbe> so when refactoring the code, I was wondering if we could stop using a dom node, and using a js object instead
[02:04:37] <Cork> i would prob go about a search and replace instead of patching like this
[02:04:42] <Lebbe> but then we have the problem with $(foo) etc
[02:04:52] <Cork> cause this will just move the problem to be on plugins using $ instead
[02:04:55] <Lebbe> I was but my boss just told me no
[02:05:04] <Lebbe> because it takes time
[02:05:33] <Cork> a sed takes that much time??
[02:05:42] <Cork> i would guess at ~ 1h top
[02:05:43] <Lebbe> if it was so simple
[02:05:47] <Lebbe> as a sed
[02:05:50] <Lebbe> i would have done it
[02:05:52] <Cork> it is
[02:05:52] <Lebbe> moments ago
[02:05:57] <Cork> i've done it
[02:06:05] <Cork> for quite complex drupal sites
[02:06:26] <Cork> and yes sites (plural)
[02:07:10] <Lebbe> they have stuff like getElement(baseRef+".amountDebit", foo).disabled
[02:07:25] <Cork> ok?
[02:07:27] <Lebbe> and other custom js functions
[02:07:37] <Cork> still  don't see how that affects it
[02:07:42] <Lebbe> $(selector, foo)
[02:07:44] <Lebbe> $(foo) etc
[02:07:51] <Lebbe> how do I sed that?
[02:08:04] <Cork> the problem you explained is that they add custom functions to the dom node
[02:08:18] <Lebbe> that is just part of the problem
[02:08:32] <Cork> just search for those function calls and replace .<function name> with .data('<match>', data);
[02:08:36] <Lebbe> they also use it as a dom node
[02:08:36] <Cork> it isn't that hard
[02:09:43] <Lebbe> i dont understand
[02:09:51] <Lebbe> why would that work
[02:10:01] <Lebbe> when you pass in this foo object to the function
[02:10:11] <Cork> cause .data stores the function in a cache inside jquery
[02:10:15] <Cork> assosiated with the node
[02:10:19] <Cork> not ON the node
[02:10:29] <Cork> meaning you remove the problem you talk about
[02:10:36] <Lebbe> but following your description it would become
[02:10:41] <Cork> and you won't have to monkey patch jquery
[02:11:06] <Lebbe> your description doesnt suit my explanation
[02:11:11] <Lebbe> getElement(baseRef+".amountDebit", foo).disabled
[02:11:22] <Lebbe> there isnt a "." in front of that function call
[02:11:32] <Cork> ug, yes there is
[02:11:36] <Cork> if .disalbed is the function
[02:11:40] <Cork> foo isn't a function
[02:11:42] <Lebbe> ...
[02:11:48] <Lebbe> getElement is a function
[02:11:56] <Cork> ok but that isn't on the dom node...
[02:11:56] <Lebbe> disabled is a property on the returned element
[02:12:06] <Cork> so doesn't have anything to do with the problem you asked about
[02:12:13] <Lebbe> i am talking about replacing foo, the second argument
[02:12:19] <Cork> but why?
[02:12:24] <Lebbe> getElement is a function who again uses jquery on foo
[02:12:30] <Cork> ok?
[02:12:47] <Lebbe> ...
[02:13:11] <[Non]> hey when i get the mouse location
[02:13:13] <Cork> your set on that you have to replace the variables content from a node to an object to keep extra data
[02:13:16] <[Non]> is it same on every screen sizes?
[02:13:19] <Cork> and i can't see why
[02:13:34] <Cork> .data() was added to the framework for exactly that kind of reasons
[02:13:46] <Lebbe> it isnt to keep extra data
[02:14:05] <Cork> uh, then we are back at square one
[02:14:12] <Cork> why do you need to replace the node with an object?
[02:14:21] <Lebbe> I dont need to do it
[02:14:36] <Cork> ...
[02:14:50] <Cork> point is, its a bad idea, find a different one
[02:14:56] <Lebbe> ok let me try to explain what is going on (even if this isnt wasnt was I asked for, I simply asked for some specific feature in jquery)
[02:15:05] <pothepanda> i know there must be a way to change the drop down options of a jquery ui selectmenu right ? can anyone please show me how ?
[02:15:10] <Cork> you will just move the problem from what ever you try to solve to plugins instead
[02:15:14] <Cork> as it will break those
[02:15:21] <Lebbe> every page in our system has a "function initialize(scope)" which initializes stuff on the page
[02:15:38] <Lebbe> all page-specific functions and fields are stored on the "scope" variable
[02:15:54] <Lebbe> the scope variable is also a DOM Node, the scope of the DOM the page is loaded within
[02:16:03] <Lebbe> (I know this is a shitty pattern, tell me about it)
[02:16:16] <Cork> not too silly yet
[02:16:24] <Lebbe> regularely they get bugs, because they do stuff like scope.remove = function() { ... }
[02:16:31] <Lebbe> overwriting the DOM Node API
[02:16:40] <Cork> hint ^ .data()
[02:17:00] <Lebbe> and this is done in thousands of lines of code in hundreds of web pages
[02:17:27] <Lebbe> so I want "scope" to be an object instead of an DOM Node
[02:17:36] <Lebbe> so we wont have to change so much code
[02:18:09] <Cork> and there is where you will get problems
[02:18:11] <Lebbe> this isnt regular code you can grep or sed, "scope" is also used as variable names etc in other places, and the fields on "scope" changes from page to page
[02:18:21] <Cork> you will just move the problem to jquery plugins
[02:18:28] <Cork> so instead move the functions to the data cache
[02:18:33] <Cork> and you will FIX the problems instead
[02:18:41] <Lebbe> but I cannot do that with a sed
[02:18:45] <Cork> sure you can
[02:18:47] <Lebbe> no
[02:18:48] <Lebbe> ...
[02:20:09] <Lebbe> how would you write a sed that recognizes "scope.randomFunctionName = function() {}" and is not too eager
[02:20:35] <Cork> firstly is the indentation aligned correctly?
[02:20:48] <Lebbe> no, I cannot assume that
[02:21:10] <Lebbe> sometimes there is not intendation within function initailize(scope) { here }, other time it is
[02:21:11] <Cork> well then you would have to run the code through a tool that parses the js
[02:21:18] <Cork> and ya that makes it a bit harder
[02:21:35] <Cork> another option is to define a helper object that does the translation
[02:21:57] <Cork> defineProperty can make a function that handlers = <value>
[02:22:03] <Lebbe> and then we of course have the case of calling these functions
[02:22:06] <Lebbe> which is done like thise
[02:22:08] <Lebbe> this*
[02:22:32] <Lebbe> <a onclick="getScope(this).randomFunctionName()">
[02:22:48] <Lebbe> which also have to be sed-ed and replaced
[02:23:35] <Cork> another option is to just use .dataset
[02:24:03] <Cork> s/.randomFunctionName/, dataset.randomFunctionName
[02:24:21] <Cork> ?g mdn dataset
[02:24:23] <b-ot> Cork: HTMLElement.dataset - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement.dataset
[02:24:24] <pothepanda> anyone can please help me change the drop down options of a jquery ui selectmenu ?
[02:25:03] <Lebbe> Cork: thanks for the help, i have to eat now :(
[02:25:22] <Cork> pothepanda: you mean the display value or what?
[02:26:08] <Lebbe> s/.randomFunctionName/ is precisely what I dont want to do, it isnt much better than manually writing all changes myself
[02:26:17] <Lebbe> there are hundreds of functions with different names
[02:26:49] <Uhkis> and that is why regex has groups
[02:27:05] <Cork> ok so do s/foo.([^\(]+)/foo.dataset.$1/ then
[02:29:28] <pothepanda> Cork: i have 2 selectmenus, pass a function to change event for selectmenu1 so i can update selectmenu2 options/elements, but i cant find a way to change these options
[02:29:48] <Cork> "change options" means?
[02:30:10] <pothepanda> Cork: change the elements of the selectmenu
[02:30:56] <Cork> and by selectmenus you mean the menu widget?
[02:31:03] <pothepanda> Cork: when you click a select menu, there is a drop down with a few elements (<options> in a normal <select>)
[02:31:05] <Uhkis> $('#selectmenu2').html('<option>1</option>');
[02:31:28] <Cork> ok, then you just replace the dome elements like Uhkis shows
[02:31:32] <pothepanda> yes the SelectMenu jquery-ui widget
[02:31:45] <Cork> it doesn't use <option>
[02:31:51] <pothepanda> yea
[02:31:56] <pothepanda> will it refresh ?
[02:32:16] <Cork> ah, now i understand why i'm so confused
[02:32:23] <Cork> i've missed the new widget!
[02:32:44] <Cork> pothepanda: so replace the option elements
[02:32:47] <Cork> and call http://api.jqueryui.com/selectmenu/#method-refresh
[02:33:33] <Cork> (i don't use jqui much so i often miss new widgets)
[02:36:47] <gtristan> This http://api.jquery.com/keyup/ does not say anything about the return value of the handler... should it be assumed that returning false stops the bubbling ? or does it also prevent the default ?
[02:36:56] <pothepanda> Uhkis: Cork : it works !!
[02:37:01] <pothepanda> thank you guys :D
[02:37:16] <pothepanda> May the force be with you !
[02:37:29] <Cork> gtristan: don't return anything
[02:37:38] <Cork> use event.preventDefault() or event.stopPropagation()
[02:37:55] <Cork> if you want to exit early use return; (no value at all)
[02:38:03] <gtristan> Cork, alright... I'm just seeing it in someone's random code so that made me curious
[02:38:09] <pothepanda> Cork: btw, if you not using jquery much so often, what do you use ?
[02:38:24] <Cork> gtristan: return false works the same as it does in native js handlers
[02:38:37] <Cork> gtristan: but return false is a gigantic pain in the back side
[02:38:44] <gtristan> alright :)
[02:38:49] <Cork> if you ever need to extend the features of a page
[02:39:14] <Cork> pothepanda: jquery != jquery-ui
[02:39:27] <Cork> pothepanda: i mainly use the slider and the dialog from ui
[02:39:28] <pothepanda> Cork: so you meant the jquery-ui, alright
[02:39:32] <Cork> and to the rest natively
[02:39:44] <gtristan> it's also utterly awkward to look at code which does a conditional { if (event something) return false; ... } without returning something else after
[02:39:46] <Cork> (and most of the time with very little dependency on js)
[02:40:05] <gtristan> presumably not returning anything is the same as 'return undefined'
[02:40:13] <gtristan> but ugh </shudders>
[02:40:14] <Cork> gtristan: it is
[02:41:05] <Cork> pothepanda: that said i have quite the respect for the jqui team there widgets is normally very well made
[02:41:28] <Cork> with the exception of accordion that is a gigantic failure
[02:42:36] <gtristan> this is the weird code in question that I found: http://jsfiddle.net/alforno/4A9N8/
[02:42:41] <gtristan> but another question...
[02:42:54] <gtristan> what is the correct way to test key codes with jquery ?
[02:43:11] <Jardayn> well
[02:43:12] <Cork> ui has a reference object
[02:43:14] <gtristan> surely the e.which || e.keyCode is garbage ;-)
[02:43:15] <Jardayn> look if they work or not o_O
[02:43:23] <Cork> in jquery you kinda have to do it on your own
[02:44:30] <Cork> if((e.keyCode || e.which) == $.ui.ENTER)
[02:44:36] <Cork> opps
[02:44:44] <Cork> if((e.keyCode || e.which) == $.ui.keyCode.ENTER)
[02:46:12] <Cork> gtristan: fyi: a new nicer check is comming to js
[02:46:12] <gtristan> err... so (e.keyCode || e.which) will not simply evaluate to 'true' or 'false' ?
[02:46:18] <Cork> e.key == 'Enter'
[02:46:30] <Cork> ?eval true
[02:46:39] <Cork> hmm no bot
[02:46:53] <Cork> gtristan: if the first value is falsy it gives you the second
[02:47:11] <Cork> and undefined is falsy so it means if the first value doesn't exist it gives you the second
[02:47:18] <gtristan> Cork, neat JS feature I didnt know
[02:47:36] <Cork> gtristan: i don't think it is even stable yet
[02:47:39] <Cork> but it is comming
[02:47:45] <gtristan> sooo... /me needs to find the definitions of keycodes
[02:47:54] <Cork> yup
[02:48:03] <kumarkrati> does anyone know how jquery ui sortable works internally?
[02:48:12] <gtristan> this has them: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent.keyCode
[02:48:33] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent.key
[02:48:35] <gtristan> Cork, so (e.keyCode || e.which) is basically the numerical value
[02:48:38] <Cork> for reference :)
[02:48:45] <Cork> gtristan: yes
[02:48:47] <gtristan> not the string one
[02:48:47] <gtristan> ok
[02:49:02] <Cork> $.ui.keyCode is an object jquery-ui provides
[02:49:15] <Cork> its { ENTER: 13 } for example
[02:49:23] <Cork> its just so you don't have to have magical number
[02:49:32] <Jardayn> lol
[02:49:33] <gtristan> wow, and that page shows them all different on different OSes
[02:49:33] * dddh is still playing with jsonp ;(
[02:49:34] <gtristan> ewwww
[02:49:44] <Cork> yup
[02:49:49] <Jardayn> A teacher from Utah had sex with 2 students, they called their relationship "A teacher with benefits"
[02:49:51] <gtristan> of course, makes sense I guess
[02:49:53] <Jardayn> lol
[02:49:57] <Jardayn> and then she got sued. lol
[02:50:03] <dddh> want to request page from another domain
[02:50:21] <Cork> gtristan: they aren't implementing .key for the fun of it
[02:50:25] <Cork> it is quite badly needed
[02:50:41] <Cork> though that said
[02:50:49] <Cork> most keycodes is the same cross os:es
[02:50:51] <gtristan> yeah... as a GTK+ guy, I know the pain of cross-platform key codes
[02:51:10] <gtristan> but hey, at least we managed to make it work with a header file and symbolic #defines :-S
[02:51:13] <kumarkrati> Is it possible to put the div to its cloned div position?
[02:51:17] <gtristan> seems we did better than the web :-S
[02:51:32] <Cork> kumarkrati: the what?
[02:51:49] <Cork> gtristan: the web predates it :)
[02:52:16] <Cork> gtristan: do you only care about visible keys?
[02:52:35] <Cork> String has a function that can help if you do
[02:52:50] <gtristan> I care about whatever causes 'entry activation' (like both ENTER and KeyPad ENTER)... and I care about ESCAPE
[02:52:53] <kumarkrati> I am trying to create a child of a parent div by pressing tab key.
[02:53:03] <gtristan> whatever means that "I'm done editing this thing"
[02:53:17] <Cork> ah
[02:53:19] <gtristan> TAB could be useful in the future
[02:53:31] <Cork> so the opposite
[02:53:37] <Cork> ya, been there done that
[02:53:38] <gtristan> especially if I want inline tab completion
[02:53:39] <Cork> isn't fun
[02:54:24] <kumarkrati> so I am  creating a clone of the div x and changing its left position. but after doing that I want the div x to take this new position
[02:54:54] <Cork> kumarkrati: is the element absolute positioned before you clone it?
[02:55:22] <Cork> if yes, then just insert it before the old element and it should work
[02:55:30] <kumarkrati> no relative position but I am setting the clone position absolute
[02:56:20] <kumarkrati> I want the old element to take the position of cloned element
[02:56:28] <Cork> kumarkrati: btw why replace the original?
[02:56:36] <Cork> just clone it and position the clone instead
[02:56:52] <Cork> then you can just grab the .position() of the parent and use that
[02:57:19] <kumarkrati> quite interesting ok
[02:57:34] <Cork> uh .position() of the original
[02:57:36] <Cork> not parent -_-'
[02:58:53] <kumarkrati> jquery ui sortable works in the same manner, but it doesnt changes the left position of the element but somehow manages to put it at the cloned position? Do you know how we can do that?
[02:59:06] <gtristan> Cork, for reference, the definitions from jquery you mentioned $.ui.KeyCode.ENTER etc... those are only in jqueryui ?
[02:59:15] <gtristan> or they are also in base jquery ?
[02:59:32] <Cork> kumarkrati: if you don't set the positions of an element it gets the position of where the element would originally be at
[02:59:55] <Cork> so if you insert it at a place where it would have the correct left position and not setting a left value
[02:59:59] <Cork> it will be where you want it
[03:00:15] <Cork> gtristan: its in jqui yes
[03:00:24] <Cork> $.ui <-- hints at that
[03:00:30] <gtristan> yeah that's what I thought
[03:00:41] <Cork> gtristan: http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.js
[03:00:57] <Cork> depending on your screen size you might have to scroll down a little
[03:01:24] <kumarkrati> ok cool I will try that thanks
[03:01:28] <gtristan> yes I see some constants there
[03:01:48] <Cork> no not constants
[03:01:55] <kumarkrati> I am using this plugin to create nested sortable functionality - https://github.com/ilikenwf/nestedSortable
[03:02:24] <gtristan> Cork, keyCode: { ... } <-- not constants ?
[03:02:37] <gtristan> they are modified for some browsers later on in the file ?
[03:02:37] <Cork> no its just properties in an object
[03:02:44] <Cork> nothing prevents you from replacing the value
[03:02:53] <Cork> $.ui.keyCode.ENTER = 10;
[03:02:57] <FinStick> hi, I need help with getting a select drop down box to auto open. Thanks
[03:03:16] <gtristan> and no later if (browser = IE8) $.ui.keyCode.ENTER = 42;
[03:03:23] <gtristan> somewhere in the file ;-)
[03:03:40] <Cork> not in jquery-ui no
[03:03:59] <Cork> some plugin you're loading could technically do it
[03:04:10] <Cork> though... hopefully not
[03:04:27] <gtristan> ok well, for now I'll just roll with those definitions
[03:04:40] <gtristan> see if anything explodes ;-)
[03:04:52] <Cork> heh
[03:08:45] <Lebbe> Cork: that regex has so many false positives in this codebase it would be easier punching the code changes manually with my nose
[03:09:15] <Cork> Lebbe: i can't write a matching regex as i don't know what it needs to handle
[03:09:25] <Cork> all i meant with it is that it is perfectly possible
[03:25:35] <ami_> Hello everyone!
[03:26:03] <ami_> Is there any technique to run jquery script on server side...
[03:27:03] <Cork> ami_: node.js
[03:27:29] <ami_> Thanks!
[03:27:42] <ami_> But I don't know node.js
[03:27:55] <stompdaroach> google does
[03:27:55] <ami_> Anything in rails..
[03:28:24] <kumarkrati> without changing left position is it possible to move a div on top of another div?
[03:29:41] <ami_> its a script which would run every 10 seconds...
[03:29:54] <OnceMe> My jquery lib loads for 350ms
[03:30:02] <OnceMe> is that normal? non-cached version, cached is 333B
[03:30:09] <OnceMe> and loads 30ms
[03:30:28] <OnceMe> I am using s3 & cloudfront from amazon, is that normal for them
[03:31:27] <ami_> Any suggestions guys!
[03:32:05] <Cork> ami_: rails is ruby, and not js
[03:32:24] <Cork> so no you can't run js in ruby without a js interpreter
[03:34:43] <OnceMe> any help for me?
[03:34:52] <OnceMe> jquery loading only lib for 350ms is too much ;(
[03:38:31] <Cork> OnceMe: load time is a server question not something we can help with
[03:42:12] <Lebbe> I found a way to fix it that doesn't involve changing thousand of lines of code (with magic or by hand)
[03:42:25] <OnceMe> Cork:yes but I use cdn
[03:42:31] <OnceMe> and its weird that takes too long?
[03:42:39] <Lebbe> instead of using a object, I use a function that returns $(domnode)
[03:42:52] <Lebbe> $(foo) will then do as usual
[03:43:14] <Cork> OnceMe: would depend on the cdn
[03:44:03] <OnceMe> I use the best S3 aws, with cloudfront to re-distributed file to the best edge locations
[03:44:16] <OnceMe> but for some reason, I load jquery from US server, when Im in EU
[03:44:20] <Cork> but nothing in the size of jquery dictates that loading time no
[03:44:22] <OnceMe> and Im sure aws have servers in EU
[03:44:27] <OnceMe> Cork:what?
[03:44:46] <OnceMe> maybe that I load it via https?
[03:44:51] <Cork> OnceMe: what i'm saying is you would have to ask someone who knows the cdn specifically
[03:45:04] <Cork> as it isn't a none specifc cdn question
[03:45:32] <Cork> nothing in the library it self forces that it should take that time to load
[03:47:12] <fas3r> Hello,
[03:47:35] <fas3r> Does "AJAX asynchronious" request is deprecated ?
[03:48:03] <Cork> fas3r: the other way around
[03:48:12] <Cork> sync is depricated
[03:48:35] <Robdgreat> interesting. I knew it was not recommended, didn't realize it was deprecated
[03:48:35] <Cork> the async: false option is deprecated
[03:48:36] <Lebbe> only "on the main thread" though
[03:49:19] <Cork> and sync calls is as deprecated in core js as it will ever get
[03:49:28] <Cork> in that it won't get any new features
[03:49:34] <Cork> and is frozen it time
[03:49:41] <Cork> all new features is async only
[03:49:54] <fas3r> Cork : ok great. thank you :D
[04:04:01] <fas3r> what is the best way to intercept "submit" event ? should I use  .on('submit','#form_name_element_id', function (e) { ... } .. or direct   .submit(function(e) { .... } ?
[04:07:26] <Cork> fas3r: depends on if the form is dynamically added or not
[04:08:23] * pothepanda dives to javascript world
[04:08:47] * pothepanda suffocates very fast, finds no escape route and dies.
[04:25:00] <pothepanda> using pattern attribute on a textbox, how can i catch the event of failed input ?
[04:30:57] <sahbeewah> you stop using the pattern attribute and proceed to validate as if it didn’t exist
[04:32:24] <Cork> pothepanda: you could bind the invalid event
[04:33:33] <pothepanda> Cork: thanks, but probably i will not use it, just realized there is a way to put a message there
[04:34:50] <delboy1978uk> how to get the folder name the js file is in?
[04:35:04] <Cork> delboy1978uk: js don'
[04:35:11] <Cork> delboy1978uk: js don't have files or folders
[04:35:25] <delboy1978uk> then where do you put a js file?
[04:35:35] <Cork> you don't
[04:35:42] <Cork> you serv them by a webserver
[04:35:49] <Cork> and the server knows where to find it
[04:35:53] <delboy1978uk> so it doesn't go in /public/js on your server?
[04:35:56] <Cork> (normally by a folder structure)
[04:36:05] <Cork> depends on the server
[04:36:08] <delboy1978uk> yes. In jquery, how do i get that folder?
[04:36:28] <Cork> all js knows is that it sends a string (absolute url) to the server and gets the script text back
[04:36:48] <delboy1978uk> so a js file can never tell where it came from
[04:36:57] <Cork> the string could just be super-script-acronym.buu for all js cares
[04:37:08] <Cork> delboy1978uk: js don't have files, like i said
[04:37:14] <Cork> you have an execution scope
[04:37:31] <Cork> but that doesn't indicate where the code was loaded from (it does indicate what domain it was from)
[04:37:38] <Cork> but this isn't exposed to content js
[04:38:42] <Cork> delboy1978uk: if the script is loaded with a <script> tag you can find that script tag and grab the url from there
[04:38:51] <Cork> but there isn't any reference in js it self
[04:39:24] <delboy1978uk> i have a jquery plugin, https://github.com/delboy1978uk/flipswitch In the plugin options, I hard coded my plugins image assets to /js/flipswitch/img/switch.png. however i tried out bower for js package management and it dumps it in a different folder
[04:40:04] <delboy1978uk> so i'm looking for a way to get the js files location so i can dynamically change the folder
[04:40:15] <Cork> you can't really do that sainly
[04:40:26] <Cork> you can get the image related to the currently loaded page
[04:40:29] <Cork> but that is about it
[04:40:58] <Cork> delboy1978uk: best option is to expose an option for image location
[04:41:05] <Cork> for the plugin
[04:42:16] <delboy1978uk> yes it can be manually set, just hoped for a nice solution that didnt care where the js file was, and could find the image relative to the js file
[04:43:10] <Cork> as js doesn't have a location, that isn't possible
[04:44:44] <Uhkis> maybe switch the image location information to css side?
[04:45:01] <Cork> ah, good point
[04:45:13] <Cork> ... i always do that my self why didn't i think of that >_<'
[04:45:25] <Cork> delboy1978uk: use background images and set classes for the different images
[04:45:35] <Cork> that would remove all the need to have this in js
[04:46:23] <Uhkis> Cork: maybe all these weird debates have taken out all your life force
[04:46:49] <Cork> Uhkis: or i'm too deep into what i'm doing and isn't really focusing...
[04:48:57] <Uhkis> :)
[04:49:03] <cjsnoekatwork> Hi! :)
[04:49:32] <cjsnoekatwork> Might be the wrong place to ask.
[04:49:47] <cjsnoekatwork> Im learning jQuery (who's not, we learn everyday right?)
[04:50:01] <cjsnoekatwork> And I created a super simple slider
[04:50:06] <cjsnoekatwork> Looking for some code review
[04:50:08] <cjsnoekatwork> It works fine
[04:50:16] <cjsnoekatwork> But I'm curious of better ways
[04:50:28] <cjsnoekatwork> Maby if anyone has the time to look, code is @stack http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/77479/super-simple-jquery-slider
[04:51:31] <Uhkis> you're defining that function in a loop, don't
[04:53:23] <cjsnoekatwork> Uhkis -> how should I do it then?
[04:54:12] <nossgingmmuc> Hello, I wish to validate a form on submit before I actually send it. Can I do this without having to use ajax?
[04:54:37] <cjsnoekatwork> onsubmit="validate()"
[04:54:38] <Cork> nossgingmmuc: sure
[04:54:48] <Cork> cjsnoekatwork: no, not use event attributes
[04:54:49] <Cork> ever
[04:54:59] <Cork> not==don't
[04:55:00] <cjsnoekatwork> Ah great, I can learn something here :D
[04:55:26] <nossgingmmuc> since my inputs are inside a <form> tag and the method is post, it submits the form when I hit the submit button.. as expected.
[04:55:27] <Cork> nossgingmmuc: just bind a submit event on the form and do the validation from there
[04:55:31] <nossgingmmuc> You are saying I can halt this action?
[04:55:35] <Cork> nossgingmmuc: you can do this with jquery.validation
[04:55:44] <Cork> nossgingmmuc: yes you can
[04:55:55] <Cork> event.preventDefault() will block the submit
[04:56:25] <Cork> $('form').on('submit', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); });
[04:56:33] <nossgingmmuc> I will try it
[04:56:36] <Uhkis> ?demo @ cjsnoekatwork
[04:56:37] <b-ot> cjsnoekatwork: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:56:53] <Cork> ?g jquery.validation
[04:56:54] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery Validation Plugin | Form validation with jQuery → http://jqueryvalidation.org/
[04:57:04] <Cork> nossgingmmuc: you might want to have a look at that one ^
[04:58:06] <nossgingmmuc> its good shit Cork?
[04:58:16] <Cork> nossgingmmuc: it is very commonly used
[04:58:44] <nossgingmmuc> however, am not sure I need a hefty plugin to validate two inputs
[04:58:46] <nossgingmmuc> numeric and a-z
[04:58:49] <nossgingmmuc> :-)
[04:58:55] <Cork> so unless you're conferrable writing the validation in an efficient way you might want to have a look at it
[04:59:16] <Cork> nossgingmmuc: what is the browser support requirements?
[04:59:28] <Cork> if it is a fairly modern browser you could just use native form validation
[04:59:52] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/Constraint_validation
[05:00:37] <Cork> it has quite hefty requirements for ie though (ie10)
[05:00:57] <nossgingmmuc> Cork: all of them!
[05:01:03] <Cork> but if you're ok with that it should do what you need
[05:01:10] <nossgingmmuc> everything but IE < 8
[05:01:19] <Cork> ah
[05:01:29] <Cork> so ie8 and 9 would be the only problem
[05:01:42] <nossgingmmuc> The only way to kill IE is for us web devs to stop supporting it
[05:01:48] <Cork> nossgingmmuc: don't forget you HAVE to have server side validation either way
[05:02:03] <nossgingmmuc> I'll let php handle that :-)
[05:02:04] <Cork> so you might just let that handle ie < 10
[05:02:08] <nossgingmmuc> yeah
[05:02:11] <nossgingmmuc> ie < 11
[05:02:17] <Cork> and do the nicer validation
[05:02:30] <cjsnoekatwork> b-ot Uhkis my script does work. There is no issue. I want to know if this is the best way to do this. Just to become a better programmer. Code is http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/77479/super-simple-jquery-slider
[05:02:30] <Cork> if that is enough you could do all you need with just form field attributes
[05:04:14] <Cork> <input type="text" required pattern="^[a-z]+$">
[05:06:46] <Uhkis> cjsnoekatwork: but it would be so much easier to review with a demo
[05:07:20] <Uhkis> cjsnoekatwork: for example, jquery ui calls this slider: http://jqueryui.com/slider/
[05:11:44] <cjsnoekatwork> Uhkis, I can put it in jsfiddle if you like?
[05:12:29] <Uhkis> cjsnoekatwork: well i'm off really soon but others might like
[05:44:58] <piwip> why is function b(o,i,l,r){i=document;l='script';r=i.createElement(l);r.src=o;i.getElementsByTagName(l)[0].parentNode.appendChild(r)} bad practice?
[05:45:05] <piwip> people say it's bad
[05:45:06] <piwip> why
[05:45:16] <delboy1978uk> Cork: I got the path of my script! http://pastie.org/9831381
[05:45:29] <Cork> piwip: could you pb the unminimized format?
[05:45:49] <Cork> if you actually write code like that then... YES that is horrible practice
[05:46:04] <piwip> it's a function that creates a script tag to load in scripts
[05:46:52] <Cork> delboy1978uk: as long as noone adds a script after your one...
[05:46:58] <Cork> cause then you break >_<
[05:47:08] <piwip> why?
[05:47:18] <delboy1978uk> will it?
[05:47:33] <piwip> oh was about other thing
[05:47:35] <Cork> delboy1978uk: you query for all script tags in the page and crabs the last one
[05:47:40] <Cork> so yes
[05:48:08] <delboy1978uk> that goes inside my script, and doesnt go in doc ready so runs the second it loads, you think it will be ok?
[05:48:12] <Cork> piwip: if you want help you need unminimized code
[05:48:29] <Cork> delboy1978uk: depends
[05:48:56] <Cork> delboy1978uk: i would prob have an id on the script tag instead
[05:49:01] <Cork> would remove the risks
[05:49:52] <delboy1978uk> yeah but then down to everyone using my plugin to remember that
[05:49:56] <HumanBeing> yo, trying to use jqeury script at http://keith-wood.name/countdownRef.html#since   It works at first (shows clock) but then stops after TypeError: inst.options undefined
[05:50:12] <delboy1978uk> what if i check for part of the filename?
[05:50:49] <Cork> delboy1978uk: you could do document.querySelector('script[src*="my-script.js"]')
[05:51:09] <Cork> though i still think this is a sub optimal solution
[05:51:11] <Cork> but what ever
[05:52:49] <Cork> delboy1978uk: Uhkis pointed out, i would have directed you to using a css files instead
[05:52:58] <Cork> its a much cleaner solution then this
[05:53:32] <Cork> delboy1978uk: just load the images through the css file and make sure it is next to the image folder (or in it) and you will get the relative path correct without sniffing
[05:54:01] <Cork> its by far the better solution
[05:55:22] <KnightsOfNi> How do you use a protection token in a form that is submitted with ajax?
[05:55:55] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: just include the token in the ajax call
[05:55:55] <KnightsOfNi> I keep getting method not allowed unless I make a crsf check not necessary
[05:56:03] <Cork> its normally just a hidden field
[05:56:12] <Cork> so if you serialize the form you would get it by default
[05:56:21] <KnightsOfNi> oh ok
[05:58:56] <cjsnoekatwork> If someone might be able to help
[05:58:57] <cjsnoekatwork> http://jsfiddle.net/pov0fw15/
[05:59:02] <cjsnoekatwork> As you can see
[05:59:14] <cjsnoekatwork> Image fades, it should loop forever
[06:01:09] <Cork> cjsnoekatwork: you shouldn't call setTimeout like that
[06:01:29] <Cork> your creating a race condition for every animation
[06:01:38] <Cork> and just happens to avoid breaking things
[06:02:35] <Cork> cjsnoekatwork: you should use the callback from fadeOut instead
[06:02:55] <Cork> else if for some reason the browser makes a hickup in the animation things will break
[06:19:32] <cjohnson> setTimeout calls will always execute in order tho
[06:19:43] <cjohnson> note I haven't read the full code
[06:20:09] <Cork> yes they will, but they won't always execute with the delay you give them
[06:20:48] <Cork> and they also do the animation even when the page isn't visible (wastes cpu and power)
[06:20:53] <cjohnson> right but the order will still be the same, so even if there's an extra long delay it still happens
[06:20:55] <Cork> so it is over all a bad choice
[06:21:19] <cjohnson> I agree probably not the best way to do it but I just don't think it would be a race condition
[06:21:23] <Cork> cjohnson: except it might trigger before the animation is complete
[06:21:43] <cjohnson> how?
[06:21:46] <Cork> cjohnson: jquery animations is done by lots of timeout triggers
[06:22:00] <Cork> and you set a timeout for one second
[06:22:07] <cjohnson> but they work similar to setTimeout right -- at the end of the day at *least* 1000 ms will have gone by
[06:22:12] <Cork> no
[06:22:16] <Cork> it works with ticks
[06:22:22] <Cork> so it fires over and over again
[06:22:40] <cjohnson> ticks? are you sure? not RAF?
[06:22:40] <Cork> you don't have a guarantee they will all trigger before your timeout
[06:22:52] <Cork> that is why you have a callback for jquery animations
[06:22:57] <Cork> it is MEANT for this
[06:23:00] <cjohnson> seems like performance would be poor if it moved via ticks
[06:23:04] <cjohnson> I totally agree with you there
[06:23:16] <cjohnson> I'm just saying I'm not convinced it wouldn't actually work here, even in a hiccup
[06:23:30] <Cork> cjohnson: ticks is a jquery abstraction
[06:23:35] <cjohnson> wat
[06:23:39] <Cork> it grabs the time the animation should take
[06:23:47] <cjohnson> a tick is a JS concept
[06:23:53] <cjohnson> usually 4ms minimum between ticks
[06:23:57] <Cork> and then it gives a tick count based for how far along that animation it should be
[06:24:12] <Cork> based on how much time has passed
[06:24:20] <Cork> its so animations have a constant speed
[06:24:51] <Cork> it has to do it with timers cause else it would frees the page and the animation wouldn't happen
[06:24:59] <Cork> (as js is single threaded)
[06:25:26] <Cork> but you never ever want to fire two timers and expect them to run at the same time
[06:25:27] <cjohnson> so you do know that a "tick" is an actual JS concept right? and you're saying jquery implemented something entirely unrelated, also called ticks, on top of this?
[06:25:35] <Cork> cause you can't make that assumption
[06:25:41] <cjohnson> no but you can fire two timers and expect them to run in the order you triggered them
[06:25:44] <cjohnson> always
[06:25:55] <cjohnson> setTimeout(a, 1000) setTimeout(b, 1000) a always runs first
[06:26:07] <Cork> cjohnson: no the ticks is ontop of jquerys animation function
[06:26:26] <cjohnson> http://javascript.info/tutorial/events-and-timing-depth
[06:26:33] <Cork> cjohnson: yes but setTimeout(a, 200) setTimeout(a, 200) setTimeout(a, 200) setTimeout(a, 200) setTimeout(a, 200) setTimeout(b, 1000)
[06:26:44] <Cork> well where the a is called from inside a
[06:26:46] <FofG> hmm, guess i didn't know enough JS to know that if i call input.val() and assign that to a var and then call input.val('') that the variable will now be ''
[06:26:49] <Cork> what will fire first?
[06:26:50] <Erwat> where can i ask grunt related questions where they can get answers?
[06:26:54] <Erwat> #grunt is very dead
[06:26:58] <Cork> you don't know
[06:27:03] <Cork> THAT is the problem i talk about
[06:27:41] <cjohnson> Ok that's true. but still, read that page I linked
[06:27:43] <Cork> FofG: string isn't references
[06:27:43] <cjohnson> ticks are a JS concept
[06:27:50] <cjohnson> not jquery
[06:27:51] <Cork> cjohnson: i know
[06:27:52] <cjohnson> ok
[06:28:01] <Cork> but it is also a jquery animation concept
[06:28:03] <FofG> Cork: ah i see.
[06:28:47] <FofG> is there a way to immediately clear the input but still "save" the input value?
[06:28:55] <cjohnson> what you wrote would do that FofG
[06:29:02] <cjohnson> var a = input.val(); input.val('');
[06:29:09] <cjohnson> a holds the val, input value is empty
[06:29:09] <Cork> cjohnson: but if you have knowledge enough to argue about that you should know you should be using requestAnimationFrame
[06:29:12] <Cork> and not setTimeout
[06:29:31] <cjohnson> I actually don't know much about RAF or when it's totally appropriate
[06:29:37] <cjohnson> I never do anything that performant in the browser
[06:29:58] <cjohnson> just that it happens more often than you can trigger with setTimeout
[06:30:04] <cjohnson> and you should keep its body slim
[06:30:19] <Cork> cjohnson: and that setTimeout causes quite a preformance loss
[06:30:42] <Cork> cause it often happens more often then the browser is actually drawing
[06:30:44] <cjohnson> hrm, now that's not true. it depends entirely on your code
[06:30:58] <Cork> cjohnson: ok, start the time and move to a different tab
[06:31:02] <Cork> wait for 20 seconds
[06:31:10] <cjohnson> the page I linked to helped me understand how to efficiently use setTimeout better
[06:31:14] <Cork> your timers will have fired 18 times more then the browser has drawn
[06:31:27] <cjohnson> ok, but that doesn't = performance loss
[06:31:30] <Cork> or rather it has modified the dome 18 times for no reason
[06:31:34] <Cork> it is
[06:31:38] <cjohnson> it *can*
[06:31:41] <cjohnson> but depends on your code
[06:31:47] <Cork> cause you take up cpu times that the browser could have used for better things
[06:31:57] <cjohnson> depends if you intend to do that or not
[06:32:07] <cjohnson> I get what you're saying
[06:32:12] <Cork> its the reason why they keep mocking with slowing down timers in background tabs
[06:32:16] <cjohnson> but it's not as universal as "setTimeout causes performance loss"
[06:32:20] <Cork> cause ppl write lousy timer looks
[06:32:22] <Cork> *loops
[06:32:32] <Cork> cjohnson: for animations, it is
[06:32:39] <cjohnson> sometimes.
[06:32:40] <cjohnson> :P
[06:32:46] <cjohnson> but again I get what you're saying
[06:32:46] <Cork> buth for your page and others
[06:32:52] <Cork> *both
[06:32:54] <cjohnson> it's just not universally true. often true, but not universally
[06:33:22] <cjohnson> I wonder how the RAF polyfills work
[06:33:22] <Cork> if you ever do animations without requestAnimationFrame you will get performance loss yes
[06:33:35] <Cork> it falls back to setTimeout
[06:33:56] <cjohnson> yeah I'm sure but does it do anything smart to avoid the issue you were talking about before
[06:34:05] <cjohnson> you *can* get performance loss
[06:34:10] <cjohnson> again, depends on your code
[06:34:45] <Cork> cjohnson: polly fills? no none
[06:35:01] <Cork> cause it can't hook into the render engines info
[06:35:02] <spm_draget> I am using jssor slider - not sure if this is part of jquery. But maybe someone knows the answer: The slidshow seems to be always on top. I cannot position a div over it, z-index values seem to be ignored.
[06:35:14] <Cork> that is why request animation frame is so important to use
[06:56:27] <stephen> spm_draget: Is it in flash?
[06:56:48] <stephen> spm_draget: if so, look up WMODE
[06:58:19] <mrchrisman> I need to build an image collage feature using Javascript and it must be compatible with IE6+.  Basically, I need to be able to drag and drop images from a grid onto a canvas where they can be resized and rotated.  Is this easily possible with Jquery considering that I need IE6 support?
[06:58:52] <cjohnson> I can't believe people still need to support IE6 :(
[06:59:27] <mrchrisman> This product will be used in China, so It needs to
[06:59:32] <mrchrisman> Depresses me too
[06:59:47] <Cork> mrchrisman: rotate will be hard
[06:59:55] <Cork> ie doesn't have any good support for that
[07:00:04] <mrchrisman> Cork: I could exclude the rotate function for just IE
[07:00:07] <Cork> ie < 9 i mean
[07:00:28] <Cork> then sure it would be possible
[07:00:36] <mrchrisman> moving around and resizing are the most important aspects.
[07:00:42] <Cork> look into jquery ui draggable
[07:01:03] <mrchrisman> Cork: could you do it? do you want to? how much would you charge?
[07:01:04] <Cork> well resize should be simple, it works out of the box with <img> tags
[07:01:29] <Cork> mrchrisman: if you want freelance you're in the wrong channel
[07:01:45] <mrchrisman> I just wondered if it was possible
[07:01:47] <Cork> its is a support channel for coding question
[07:01:52] <Cork> it is
[07:01:56] <mrchrisman> cool
[07:02:08] <Cork> ie supports 90dec rotation
[07:02:11] <Cork> but not more then that
[07:02:22] <Cork> (location 1-4)
[07:02:31] <Cork> or 0-3 don't remember
[07:02:41] <mrchrisman> Cork: do you know of a freelance javascript channel?
[07:02:43] <Cork> its part of the css filter option they have
[07:03:08] <Cork> #freelancers
[07:04:46] <mrchrisman> thanks
[07:04:50] <Cork> np
[07:04:57] <cjsnoekatwork> Cork, how should I do it then? What function should i use?
[07:05:12] <mrchrisman> Cork: there's no-one there
[07:05:22] <Cork> cjsnoekatwork: context?
[07:05:29] <Cork> mrchrisman: not sure then
[07:05:40] <mrchrisman> Cork: you just guessed, right?
[07:05:59] <Cork> mrchrisman: i know there is a few channels, but i don't remember the name
[07:06:04] <Cork> the one i gave you is one of them
[07:06:11] <cjsnoekatwork> The javascript slider
[07:06:54] <Cork> wow... i had that long argument with cjohnson and thought it was you >_<'
[07:07:10] <Cork> cjsnoekatwork: i suggest reading through that convo XD
[07:07:18] <Cork> its quite full with info about how to do it right
[07:07:39] <Cork> cjsnoekatwork: but at the very least use the callback for fadeOut instead of adding an extra setTimeout after
[07:08:07] <Cork> the requestAnimationFrame is good if you do, but requires deeper knowledge about js

[07:36:38] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know if I can have one version of jQuery effect a page globally, then have another version effect everything that's a child of a specific selector?
[07:37:20] <cjohnson> DeltaHeavy: you can load two jquerys using noConflict I believe
[07:38:03] <DeltaHeavy> Wouldn't I have to update a gigantic amount of existing references to '$' though?
[07:39:33] <cjohnson> Maybe I don't understand your problem
[07:39:54] <cjohnson> you can load jquery within a closure, overwrite $ only inside that closure, and only use that jquery there
[07:39:54] <DeltaHeavy> I have a website running on jQuery 1.7.x
[07:39:59] <cjohnson> without destroying the global window.$
[07:40:16] <cjohnson> er noconflict within a closure I guess? I don't really remember the exact syntax
[07:40:19] <DeltaHeavy> I have some stuff from a vendor that's loaded via an XHR request that requires jQuery 1.11.x and they're bitching that we're using the wrong version of jQuery.
[07:40:27] <DeltaHeavy> When we upgrade to 1.11.x it breaks other things on that page
[07:40:37] <cjohnson> I mean, the obvious solution is to fix the page
[07:40:41] <cjohnson> and use the latest jquery
[07:40:42] <cjohnson> :P
[07:41:05] <cjohnson> but yeah your vendor could write their code to not suck and load its own dependencies without clobbering the rest of the site
[07:41:28] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, we've been telling them to just use an iframe but one of their devs is claiming iframes are deprecated even after throwing the HTML5 spec at them.
[07:41:31] <DeltaHeavy> And this site isn't even on HTML5.
[07:41:37] <DeltaHeavy> French Canadians...
[07:42:07] <StanAccy> nothing like telling your paying clients that they are wrong
[07:42:48] <DeltaHeavy> I wouldn't mind if they weren't wrong and stubborn about it.
[07:42:56] <DeltaHeavy> It's like "Here's proof as objective fact" "...no"
[07:43:13] <cjohnson> they don't need to use an iframe to not clobber your code
[07:43:27] <cjohnson> link them to this http://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/
[07:43:44] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, I've used that before when working on a site that also used prototype
[07:43:53] <cjohnson> yep, it'll work here too
[07:45:04] <graphettion> So you can keep the data from page to page without an iframe with .noConflict?
[07:45:15] <graphettion> .noConflict()*
[07:45:21] <maddtech> The company that we use for our CMS is the same way.  They load a version jquery that is at least 3 versions old and typically everything I write is with the latest version.  They don't care to update at all.
[07:45:26] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, I think I'm just going to push for that.
[07:46:33] <graphettion> maddtech: They have a migration plugin for that.
[07:46:38] <cjohnson> graphettion: yes. loading jquery only overwrites window.$. If you use noConflict, you can restore the value of window.$ and put the variable wherever you like
[07:46:51] <cjohnson> thus not impacting any other code
[07:46:52] <graphettion> maddtech : https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/#readme
[07:47:09] <maddtech> Awesome, thanks.
[07:47:20] <graphettion> Holy crap, cjohnson
[07:47:21] <graphettion> ty
[07:48:19] <DeltaHeavy> cjohnson: You expect too much from corporate programmers lol
[07:48:31] <DeltaHeavy> It's really fustrating working with some of these people.
[07:48:57] <graphettion> lol
[07:49:12] <cjohnson> yeah I know how that goes :P but sometimes you reach the right dev on the other end who can actually solve the issue
[07:49:21] <DeltaHeavy> Naw, these people are gigantic bitches
[07:49:30] <Cr0vaX> sorry to post again, but got no answer for this, When I click "editar pedido" button I want the user to confirm or cancel, so I change the content of "botoes" class with 2 buttons "cancelar" and "confirmar", then I want to catch the "cancelar" event in order to show "editar pedido" button, but it submits the form, what am I doing wrong? http://jsfi
[07:49:30] <Cr0vaX> ddle.net/6x556tf2/
[07:49:36] <cjohnson> but I would seriously investigate updating your code
[07:49:37] <DeltaHeavy> And a lot of my co-workers are back-end snob who think JS is "scripting" and not "programming"
[07:49:47] <DeltaHeavy> cjohnson: THat would cost tens of thousands of dollars to update.
[07:49:54] <DeltaHeavy> Tons of regression testing
[07:49:57] <DeltaHeavy> Teams of people
[07:50:03] <Cr0vaX> PS: I'm using bootstrap and jquery
[07:50:26] <cjohnson> do you work at facebook?
[07:50:28] <LukePOLO> I have a really interesting issue where im calling an AJAX call,  url: '/experiment/save',  and while theres an iframe on the page it uses that URL instead ...anyone ever run into this ?
[07:50:32] <DeltaHeavy> cjohnson: Nope
[07:50:41] <cjohnson> I can't imagine updating jquery would really cost all that much unless your application is facebook-sized
[07:50:50] <cjohnson> maybe in a worst case scenario
[07:50:54] <DeltaHeavy> cjohnson: Well it breaks shit in tons and tons of places.
[07:51:07] <cjohnson> well, right, you can't just drop-in-and-replace
[07:51:09] <DeltaHeavy> Plus any change requires QA to go through the ENTIRE site with tens of thousands of pages for regression testing.
[07:51:13] <cjohnson> you'll have to migrate deprecated methods to use new stuff
[07:51:18] <cjohnson> but that's mostly find-and-replace
[07:51:27] <cjohnson> how are your tests not automated with an app this large?
[07:51:31] <DeltaHeavy> And over a month of regression testing.
[07:51:33] <DeltaHeavy> Nope
[07:51:34] <DeltaHeavy> Sadly
[07:51:37] <DeltaHeavy> Hail corporate
[07:51:39] <cjohnson> haha fuck
[07:51:44] <DeltaHeavy> Been bitching about that too
[07:51:52] <DeltaHeavy> This is also an IE8 only issue
[07:51:57] <DeltaHeavy> I say, if you use IE8 don't expect shit to work
[07:52:01] <DeltaHeavy> And you should probably kill yourself =/
[07:52:15] <akkufomk> ^^
[07:52:29] <DeltaHeavy> Well apperently changing jQ isn't an option
[07:52:38] <DeltaHeavy> Feel like I might as well jerk off the rest of the day lol
[07:52:56] <DeltaHeavy> Doesn't help that IE8 doesn't offer any sane sort of way to troubleshoot
[07:54:36] <graphettion> DeltaHeavy: Think of it this way, job security ;)
[07:54:50] <DeltaHeavy> Not really
[07:54:58] <DeltaHeavy> I'm on contract and if they're not confidant in us they won't renew it
[07:55:06] <DeltaHeavy> Yet at the same time they're being utterly retarded
[07:55:10] <DeltaHeavy> The vendor mainly
[07:55:14] <DeltaHeavy> They're snobby assholes
[07:55:25] <graphettion> Ah.
[07:55:27] <DeltaHeavy> Which is par for the course for literally every god damn company I've worked with from Qubec lol
[07:55:31] <DeltaHeavy> Quebec*
[07:56:17] <graphettion> Pig and chicken principle
[07:56:21] <graphettion> Ugh!
[07:56:48] <DeltaHeavy> No idea what that is lol
[07:57:11] <graphettion> DeltaHeavy : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicken_and_the_Pig#Agile_project_management
[07:58:13] <DeltaHeavy> No, the PM wouldn't get his contract renewed either
[07:58:21] <DeltaHeavy> The PM loves me and wants me on all his projects lol
[07:58:32] <DeltaHeavy> Or you talking about the 3rd party vendor?
[07:58:41] <graphettion> 3rd party vendor
[07:58:49] <graphettion> Not much you can do I guess.
[07:58:50] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, aids and cancer upon them
[07:59:02] <DeltaHeavy> They dare fill me with IE8 rage and stick around ot see what happens?
[07:59:03] <graphettion> Yeah, they aren't really committed. You are.
[07:59:06] <DeltaHeavy> I'll end them =/
[07:59:13] <DeltaHeavy> IE8 rage is the most powerful force in the universe.
[07:59:33] <graphettion> Make Darth Vader look like a baby.
[07:59:37] <DeltaHeavy> Besides for IE6-7 rage of course but those days are long gone besides in China and look at their suicide rate =/
[07:59:49] <graphettion> IE6 is dead completely
[07:59:53] <graphettion> No support
[08:00:11] <graphettion> IE7 is low but still out there
[08:00:39] <graphettion> When you have a population like China, suicide rates are not surprising.
[08:04:47] <TweedleDee> if I had an input id="blah" would the javascript focus be what I'm looking for to put the user inside that field, IE; $(
[08:04:58] <TweedleDee> '#blah').focus()
[08:05:21] <TweedleDee> guess I could have just tried it... lol apparently lazy
[08:19:40] <Cr0vaX> When I click "editar pedido" button I want the user to confirm or cancel, so I change the content of "botoes" class with 2 buttons "cancelar" and "confirmar", then I want to catch the "cancelar" event in order to show "editar pedido" button, but it submits the form, what am I doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/6x556tf2/
[08:30:46] <DeltaHeavy> I have jQuery 1.7 included at the top of a web page. I'm only able to add jQuery 1.11 AFTER 1.7 and I want $/jQuery = 1.7 and a deferred reference to = 1.11. How is this possible?
[08:42:54] <KaneCohen> Guys, does anyone know who can i talk to about restoring password on http://bugs.jqueryui.com?
[08:43:52] <Meir`> KaneCohen, is there something wrong with http://bugs.jqueryui.com/reset_password ?
[08:45:36] <KaneCohen> Meir`, dunno, but i've tried it and didn't receive email with new password. It might be possible that i've used some odd email when signing up.
[08:47:20] <KaneCohen> Meir`, i'm not sure that i even used email when signing up as it's an optional field
[08:54:05] <StanAccy> when using jsfiddle to debug some jquery code, is it possible to see the results of a form submit?
[08:54:37] <StanAccy> my jquery code is attempting to append some additional form data on a hidden field within the form but Im not receiving it server side
[08:56:01] <BillCriswell> StanAccy: You can do console.table($(this).serializeArray()); e.preventDefault(); in the forms submit event.
[08:56:18] <StanAccy> BillCriswell: Oh thanks!
[08:56:23] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[08:59:36] <gnarf> StanAccy: check out http://requestb.in/ also
[08:59:46] <gnarf> you can create one and then set your form target there
[09:00:04] <robertmaxrees> oooh.  that's a neat one.
[09:01:07] <StanAccy> gnarf: Thats neat, thanks
[09:01:24] <StanAccy> its not showing post params though
[09:03:13] <robertmaxrees> StanAccy are you sure that you're correctly appending the inputs to the form and doing so before it submits?
[09:03:40] <BillCriswell> gnarf: Snazztown.
[09:03:47] <StanAccy> robertmaxrees: I dont know :-) Hence why Im debugging it :-)  Does .submit() send everything within the form?
[09:03:49] <gnarf> StanAccy: yeah it is: http://requestb.in/14b9u0m1?inspect
[09:04:03] <robertmaxrees> .submit() submits the form, yes.
[09:04:08] <gnarf> StanAccy: .submit() sends non-disabled form elements
[09:04:52] <robertmaxrees> adding the hidden inputs to the form on the submit event doesn't necessaqrily work.
[09:04:59] <StanAccy> so what am I doing wrong here: http://jsfiddle.net/5TMBJ/15/
[09:05:30] <StanAccy> Im expecting to receive "this is a test" in the post
[09:05:31] <gnarf> a) using an onclick
[09:05:37] <robertmaxrees> the form is submitted before the inputs have a chance to get appended.
[09:05:46] <gnarf> b) yuor form isn't method="post"
[09:05:48] <robertmaxrees> also bind to the form's submit event
[09:06:01] <StanAccy> oh duh... thanks gnarf
[09:14:08] <StanAccy> ok Im still not seeing post params from this: http://jsfiddle.net/5TMBJ/23/    What am I missing here?
[09:14:41] <robertmaxrees> you need to prevent the submit event, modify the form, then resubmit.
[09:14:55] <StanAccy> I thought .submit() fired before the actual real submit ?
[09:14:59] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:15:10] <StanAccy> its intercepting the event?
[09:15:19] <StanAccy> but Im seeing the request made to the remote URL
[09:15:25] <robertmaxrees> the submit is firing before your JS runs.
[09:15:40] <StanAccy> its not - I can see the browser info set in the textfield
[09:15:50] <robertmaxrees> but it's not included in the post, right?
[09:15:54] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: You sure about that?
[09:15:54] <StanAccy> correct
[09:16:43] <StanAccy> is on('submit',...) equivalent to .submit( ... ); ?
[09:17:05] <robertmaxrees> .submit() uses .on('submit') under the hood.
[09:17:51] <slax0r> is JS sensitive for clients decimal point settings?
[09:18:43] <StanAccy> ok, if I remove all the JS and submit the 1 input element form to requestb.in I dont see any post params either
[09:19:05] <BillCriswell> StanAccy: http://requestb.in/znl01azn?inspect I got this with http://jsbin.com/yasomezawu/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:20:04] <StanAccy> bah, then why isnt the simlpe text field not being sent in my example.
[09:21:43] <StanAccy> BillCriswell: I added an input element (type="text") to your example - I see the two hidden fields there, but not the input element I added
[09:21:44] <devkinetic> hey i have a bit of a silly question. I have a coda slider with a tabbed navigation of hash links. I need to modify it so when the user clicks the active tab (after selecting it in the first place) it instead sends them to a url I specify. Can I bind a click function within another click function?
[09:23:07] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5TMBJ/26/ this works.
[09:23:10] <robertmaxrees> give the input a name.
[09:23:36] <StanAccy> oh, of course!
[09:23:41] <StanAccy> robertmaxrees: Thanks
[09:24:33] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: The resubmission isn't needed.
[09:24:39] <robertmaxrees> aye - i see that now.
[09:24:42] <robertmaxrees> i always get leary though.
[09:24:45] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Word
[09:25:00] <robertmaxrees> i might be conflating this with ajax submissions.
[09:25:04] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: haha yeah, would be cooler if it was like "beforeSubmit" or something.
[09:25:25] <robertmaxrees> devkinetic you can do that, but it's not a good idea.
[09:25:30] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener instead.
[09:30:55] <devkinetic> robertmaxrees: thanks assuming you mean .delegate() ?
[09:31:14] <robertmaxrees> the delegated syntax of .on()
[09:31:25] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('event', 'child', function() {});
[09:31:51] <robertmaxrees> where 'parent' is an ancestor element that exists on pageload and 'child' is the element you care about.
[09:32:39] <devkinetic> robertmaxrees: gotcha. thanks so much!
[09:50:29] <athan> If I have a query with multiple results, how could I grab the first child of all those results?
[09:51:17] <robertmaxrees> "a query" = "a selector"?
[09:51:42] <robertmaxrees> 'cause that'd be .eq(0)
[09:52:38] <athan> robertmaxrees: In theory, yes :P. Right now, it's `$("someElem").children()`
[09:53:00] <robertmaxrees> ah, then a jquery collection.  yeah, just slap .eq(0) on the end of that.
[09:53:13] <robertmaxrees> or .first()
[09:57:52] <athan> robertmaxrees: I think I actually want a `map .first()`, if that makes sense :\
[09:57:59] <athan> I want the first child of all those children
[09:58:24] <robertmaxrees> you can do that.
[09:59:04] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple.
[09:59:16] <athan> without lodash?
[09:59:22] <robertmaxrees> jquery has a map function.
[09:59:27] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/map/
[09:59:31] <athan> oh!!
[09:59:38] <athan> beautiful, thank you :)
[09:59:41] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[10:05:12] <richardje> if i have a url, something/#anything how can i store 'anything' in a js var
[10:12:23] <robertmaxrees> var thePageHash = window.location.hash;
[10:12:44] <robertmaxrees> unless it's apart of a string, then it's var theHash = someString.split('#')[1]
[10:39:29] <subleq> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2012 anyone have a workaround for that?
[10:39:54] <subleq> I guess I could monkeypatch _evalUrl but I'd rather not
[11:07:45] <sweet2k4> i want to chnage the href of an <a> element with the class productBack, this seams not to work
[11:07:45] <sweet2k4> $('productBack').prop('href', '/wp-content/themes/fixclip/images/6-pack-baksida-sv.jpg');
[11:08:18] <robertmaxrees> $('.productBack')
[11:08:19] <BillCriswell> sweet2k4: You forgot the .
[11:08:43] <sweet2k4> BillCriswell: were?
[11:08:48] <sweet2k4> oh
[11:08:50] <sweet2k4> thnaks
[11:08:52] <BillCriswell> sweet2k4: Where robertmaxrees said.
[11:09:21] <sweet2k4> stupid misstake, thanks for poiting it out
[11:14:35] <athan> Hmm, `.change()` doesn't seem to get called for <select> nodes :\
[11:15:45] <Sal> in what event should i do DOM changes?
[11:15:54] <robertmaxrees> Sal huh?
[11:16:07] <BillCriswell> athan: How are they changing?
[11:16:21] <Sal> now i'm doing it in document.ready, but i still see some screen changes after the page has been displayed
[11:16:47] <robertmaxrees> athan http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/57zq4bzy/
[11:17:05] <athan> BillCriswell: I'm just trying to capture any UX changes to the current selected value
[11:17:05] <robertmaxrees> Sal are you making those changes?
[11:17:14] <Sal> for rxample, i need to hide some stugg depending on some var values, where should i do it so that the page that comes out is already set correctly?
[11:17:34] <athan> robertmaxrees: Hmm... I'll give it a go :) Thank you!!
[11:17:39] <Sal> stugg=stuff
[11:17:52] <Sal> robertmaxrees, yep
[11:18:19] <robertmaxrees> Sal then fix up your logic to run your code in the right order.
[11:18:27] <Snerf> any idea how to change the color of an option in a  <select> which has a different color:  The dropdown shows the color, but not when the item is actually selected.
[11:19:06] <BillCriswell> Snerf: Like, a default select element?
[11:20:07] <Snerf> BillCriswell.. when an item is selected , the color jsut remains black, not the color that the actual option has (red)
[11:20:26] <Snerf> which does properly show with the drop down clicked
[11:20:30] <BillCriswell> Snerf: A default select element though? Like <select> ?
[11:20:30] <Sal> robertmaxrees, let me explain better, i need to get the fixed toolbar height so that i can set the body padding-top
[11:20:40] <Snerf> BillCriswell, aye
[11:20:40] <Sal> i do it all in document.ready()
[11:20:50] <Sal> but sometimes, i see the page move down
[11:21:07] <Sal> thats because padding gets applied after page was displayed
[11:21:26] <robertmaxrees> Sal why is the padding applied after?
[11:21:34] <Sal> have no idea
[11:21:50] <robertmaxrees> something seems off here.
[11:22:01] <Sal> all i do is: $('body').css("padding-top", appbarHeight + 'px');
[11:22:14] <Snerf> BillCriswell - http://jsfiddle.net/qmtu9uej/1/
[11:22:32] <hlvwrk> BillCriswell for president!
[11:22:33] <BillCriswell> Snerf: Those doesn't work at all in chrome.
[11:22:45] <robertmaxrees> Sal is the code reading the height placed after the code setting it?
[11:22:55] <BillCriswell> hlvwrk: No way, too much stress plus not intelligent enough.
[11:23:03] <Snerf> BillCriswell, it works if I change the css for the entire select, not per item
[11:23:10] <hlvwrk> too intelligent, you mean.
[11:23:18] <hlvwrk> you're giving politicians way too much credit
[11:23:18] <hlvwrk> :x
[11:23:28] <BillCriswell> hlvwrk: Haha.
[11:23:33] <robertmaxrees> fwiw my parents both served in public office hlvwrk ;)
[11:23:37] <Sal> nop
[11:23:49] * hlvwrk nopes right out of this conversation.
[11:23:54] <hlvwrk> sorry robertmaxrees .
[11:24:02] <Sal> robertmaxrees, http://i.imgur.com/LJfQIca.png
[11:24:07] <robertmaxrees> generalizations are funny like that.
[11:24:11] <hlvwrk> true.
[11:24:12] <BillCriswell> Snerf: Styling <select> elements never goes smoothly.
[11:24:24] <robertmaxrees> Sal that's not helpful.
[11:24:24] <hlvwrk> i don't like most politicians though, so it's nothing personal.
[11:24:27] <robertmaxrees> something is off here.
[11:24:38] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk like i said, generalizations are funny like that.
[11:25:02] <Snerf> BillCriswell, yes, but its doable ;)
[11:25:19] <hlvwrk> robertmaxrees most generalizations become generalizations for a reason.
[11:25:20] <hlvwrk> ;P
[11:25:36] <robertmaxrees> eeeh.  i'll leave it at that.
[11:25:40] <Sal> anyway, all iwanted to know is if the document.ready the correct event to do it
[11:26:06] <BillCriswell> Snerf: There's little to no consistency across browsers though.
[11:26:12] <robertmaxrees> Sal $(document).ready(); is when the page is "ready" - all markup basically exists and layout is basically done.
[11:26:24] <Snerf> BillCriswell, ya, true enough. What do you suggest?
[11:26:37] <Sal> and shown?
[11:26:50] <robertmaxrees> Sal not necessarily.  that fires before all assets have loaded.
[11:26:58] <robertmaxrees> well, it CAN fire before all assets have loaded, like images.
[11:27:16] <Sal> so thats it
[11:27:33] <Sal> there's really no event that fires when page is loaded but not shown
[11:27:34] <robertmaxrees> why are you setting that css in your JS?
[11:27:49] <robertmaxrees> Sal the load often fires after the page is displaying.
[11:28:00] <robertmaxrees> document ready -> window load
[11:28:15] <Sal> ok
[11:28:31] <robertmaxrees> $(window).load(function() { /* everything has loaded */ });
[11:28:39] <BillCriswell> Snerf: I'd go with something custom if I absolutely had to.
[11:28:51] <Sal> i'm doing it in js because if the user uses a fixed application bar, all the body should be moved down
[11:29:03] <Snerf> BillCriswell, ty
[11:29:05] <Sal> so i just check to see what classes he has used in html to do it
[11:29:17] <robertmaxrees> Sal you can apply that in CSS instead.
[11:29:49] <Sal> and also, the application bar can change side when the tab bar is displayed or when a sub fixed header is displayed
[11:30:01] <Sal> robertmaxrees, how?
[11:30:09] <BillCriswell> Snerf: http://tympanus.net/Development/SelectInspiration/index.html lots of fun ones here if you feel like going a little nuts.
[11:30:25] <Sal> o mean, if the class is on the application bar div, how can that effect the body tag?
[11:30:33] <robertmaxrees> sibling selectors, etc.
[11:30:48] <Sal> example?
[11:31:08] <robertmaxrees> for what?
[11:31:09] <Sal> lets say that its: <div class="appbar">
[11:31:21] <robertmaxrees> can you give an example of your markup?
[11:31:24] <Sal> .appbar ???? {...}
[11:31:26] <robertmaxrees> so i can give a pertinent example.
[11:31:49] <robertmaxrees> oh, you're styling the body tag?
[11:31:50] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[11:32:01] <robertmaxrees> i'd rething your styles personallu.
[11:32:01] <Sal> yes
[11:32:02] <robertmaxrees> but meh.
[11:32:12] <robertmaxrees> i guess JS is your only recourse there.
[11:32:25] <Sal> why? how would you do it?
[11:32:38] <Sal> apply a top margin to the page container?
[11:32:49] <Sal> instead of the body?
[11:33:01] <robertmaxrees> without seeing exactly what you;re doing it's hard to say.  if you've got a fixed position nav, top margin to the page container or something similar probably makes the most sense.
[11:33:25] <Sal> but aint body already a page container?
[11:33:44] <robertmaxrees> you love flexibility when styling it like this.
[11:33:47] <robertmaxrees> *lose
[11:34:04] <Sal> ok, i get it
[11:34:36] <Sal> so, i should apply top margin on the next same level div
[11:34:42] <Sal> and that should be the page container
[11:34:48] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[11:34:55] <graphettion> Is there a way to use jQuery to hold data when going from one page to another without using an iframe or ajax? For example, I have a quiz with a question on each page. When I click next, the variable would be erased.
[11:34:56] <robertmaxrees> or however you're styling it.
[11:35:18] <robertmaxrees> graphettion cookies or localstorage can persist the data.
[11:35:25] <Sal> but this will not make it change when i show other toolbars in the application bar
[11:35:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:36:00] <graphettion> robertmaxrees: kk, cool, I'll look into localstorage - thanks!
[11:36:39] <Sal> in the appbar, i have: actionbar (with action icons), tab bar (with tabs) and list subheader bar
[11:36:52] <Sal> all these bars could be activated depending on whats on the page
[11:37:03] <Sal> so, i think only js could do it
[11:37:32] <robertmaxrees> i can't visualize your markup based off descriptions of your UI.
[11:37:50] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you need to rethink how you're applying styles/classes/etc.
[11:39:07] <desophos> "[$jq(li).html() for (li of $jq(itemContainer).find('ul.mods li'))]" gives me "TypeError: $jq(...).find(...)['@@iterator'] is not a function"
[11:39:24] <desophos> can i not use listcomps with jquery or am i doing something wrong?
[11:39:52] <desophos> er... array comprehensions ;)
[11:40:18] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[11:40:21] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[11:41:00] <desophos> trying to get an array of the .html() of each element returned from a query selector
[11:41:12] <robertmaxrees> .map()
[11:41:35] <robertmaxrees> specifically, http://api.jquery.com/map/
[11:44:15] <desophos> alright got it, thanks robertmaxrees; i guess the answer is that i cannot use array comprehensions with jquery?
[11:44:22] <robertmaxrees> you can, sort of.
[11:44:47] <robertmaxrees> the "array indexes" are all plain DOM nodes though.
[11:44:56] <robertmaxrees> so you can't access jquery methods without re-wrapping them.
[11:45:19] <robertmaxrees> you can use .eq(i) to get the jquery wrapped versions instead, but that's a little funky.
[11:46:32] <desophos> hmm... ok
[11:46:48] <robertmaxrees> that make sense?
[11:46:55] <Absolute0> Can I speed up this select: $this.parents('.form-group').find(':input:not([disabled])').prop('checked', true).change(); ?
[11:47:04] <Absolute0> It's slow when there are a lot of boxes.
[11:47:31] <Absolute0> it was the change...
[11:47:39] <robertmaxrees> Absolute0 look at using .closest() instead of .parents() and look at using a .filter() instead of :input:not([disabled]).
[11:48:00] <robertmaxrees> also see what logic the change event is firing.
[11:48:03] <Absolute0> .change was the culprit
[11:48:18] <BillCriswell> Can you check a disabled element?
[11:48:28] <Absolute0> BillCriswell: you can.
[11:48:32] <BillCriswell> Weird.
[11:48:50] <desophos> robertmaxrees: by "array indexes" you mean the iterator values?
[11:49:16] <robertmaxrees> desophos i guesS?  trying to understand how you were iterating in the first place.
[11:49:49] <desophos> doesn't an array comp iterate over the array you give it?
[11:50:15] <robertmaxrees> your code hardly makes sense.
[11:50:37] <robertmaxrees> for (li of $jq(itemContainer).find('ul.mods li')) isn't a valid way to iterate over an array in the first place.
[11:50:40] <BillCriswell> I figured you'd need to .disable = false; before you can switch it.
[11:51:01] <desophos> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Predefined_Core_Objects#Array_comprehensions
[11:51:10] <desophos> i was trying to use one of those
[11:51:26] <robertmaxrees> i hope you're not planning on using those in production.
[11:51:46] <robertmaxrees> but the jquery object isn't an array, only array-like, so you can only sort of treat it like an awway.
[11:52:03] <desophos> 1. why not? 2. i see

[12:05:36] <mazda3jquery> Got a question. I need to search and highlight text across tags <div>t</div><div>e</div><div>s</div><div>t</div>  They could be spans or who knows what else. I found this post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19710158/jquery-highlight-pieces-of-text-in-an-element-across-tags but it doesn't provide a working solution :| Here is a jsfiddle of what i need to match:  http://jsfiddle.net/a9wsj97u/
[12:12:21] <mazda3jquery> Anyone?
[12:13:21] <rocky> anyone have a favourite select box jquery widget ... one that allows to either select one of the items in the dropdown or enter a custom value?
[12:13:27] <MeXTuX> I have a menu with 11 items. 10 items have submenus. When I see the web page on mobile I need to scroll down the menu but when I do this items start to expand. To prevent this I need to know when the event is a tap or a swipe. Is this possible?
[12:13:36] <rocky> most widgets i've seen so far only let you type stuff in to filter the actual dropdown
[12:14:37] <BillCriswell> mazda3jquery: I might have something...
[12:15:54] <BillCriswell> mazda3jquery: Nevermind.
[12:15:57] <BillCriswell> Just read closer.
[12:16:09] <mazda3jquery> Seems to be a nearly impossible problem
[12:16:57] <BillCriswell> mazda3jquery: The word being across different html nodes is weird.
[12:17:27] <mazda3jquery> It is a document displayer plugin and it formats colors and other styles into html to display like that.
[12:17:43] <mazda3jquery> Unfortunately thats the way it is.
[12:18:25] <BillCriswell> mazda3jquery: http://jsbin.com/nesefa/2/edit?html,js,output did this a while back, but probably won't help much haha
[12:20:14] <mazda3jquery> Yea, im not sure if there is an already made solution to this problem. Coding it by hand will be extremely difficult as well.
[12:20:40] <BillCriswell> mazda3jquery: So you'd need to highlight that string across all those lines?
[12:22:35] <BillCriswell> MeXTuX: What event are you using to open the menu?
[12:23:05] <mazda3jquery> Yes, it would need to act as though it was a line of text. Normally its floated left so its inline like 1 word or sentence. To the user its there.
[12:23:44] <MeXTuX> BillCriswell: click
[12:24:10] <BillCriswell> and clicks are firing as you're scrolling?
[12:25:09] <MeXTuX> Yes. Tested on an iPhone
[12:26:19] <BillCriswell> hmm, something sounds off.
[12:26:34] <MeXTuX> Yes. Do I need to include jQuery Mobile to use swipe event?
[12:27:18] <BillCriswell> I thought you meant swipe as like scroll down the page?
[12:27:37] <BillCriswell> Well, you said it was triggering on scroll.
[12:32:19] <MeXTuX> http://npaste.com/ni6oyw    Food item has many suboptions and when user tries to swipe items expand. Can that be fixed with jQuery?
[12:33:00] <Es0teric> question — when sending an ajax request to a form, how would you go about creating a blackhole for the second request?
[12:33:55] <Es0teric> in other words i just want one form submit, i dont want to user to be able to submit multiple times
[12:34:46] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Disable the submit button after the submit event.
[12:35:14] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: would .one() work too?
[12:35:35] <BillCriswell> That wouldn't keep a form from being submitted more than once.
[12:37:27] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Though... disabling the button might allow the keyboard to still submit multiple times.
[12:37:56] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: yeah.. so should i just disable enter and the submit button on success?
[12:38:45] <BillCriswell> Might need to do something like  and if (!$form.data('submitted')) { $form.data('submitted', true); } else { event.preventDefault(); }
[12:39:15] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: I wouldn't disable enter, I'd just set a variable letting you know the form was submitted. On the form element itself makes the most sense to me.
[12:41:02] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: so then do i hide the form if the var i set is true?
[12:41:18] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: That's up to you.
[12:45:28] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: have you used twitter bootstrap modal?
[12:45:38] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Can't say I have.
[12:45:53] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: ok so then how do i set something to delay and then toggle another function?
[12:46:24] <Es0teric> for instance, on success of this post request (ajax) i want to delay this function from executing after 10s
[12:47:08] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: is that settimeout ?
[12:47:41] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: You want to renable after success?
[12:47:56] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: no, i am hiding the modal on success but i want to show the message before its hidden
[12:48:01] <Es0teric> the “success” message
[12:50:32] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees shoky i feel like such an idiot for last night. I totally got the hash working with, like, no work at all.. i needed to clear my head
[12:50:38] <robertmaxrees> it's cool :)
[12:50:43] <robertmaxrees> and happens all the time.

[13:21:46] <igcewieling> I'm still not all that good with javascript.   I have a snippet of code I found online and am still trying to understand one specific thing.  The code is here http://jsfiddle.net/uL84jk37/  Wouldn't the variable clonedHeaderRow would be overwritten on every iteration of the .each() ?   If so why not declare the variable inside the function instead of the parent scope?
[13:22:33] <robertmaxrees> igcewieling it should be in that each.
[13:22:40] <robertmaxrees> is it access outside of that each?
[13:23:03] <robertmaxrees> *accessed?
[13:23:05] <igcewieling> robertmaxrees: No.
[13:23:21] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that var should be in that each - try moving it there and see if it still works.
[13:23:58] <igcewieling> robertmaxrees: thanks for the help, glad to know something which looked wrong to me was actually wrong.
[13:24:12] <robertmaxrees> there might be a reason for it, but I can't think of one.
[13:24:15] <robertmaxrees> you're catching on though.
[13:24:22] <robertmaxrees> most people don't learn abotu scoping for a long time.
[13:26:16] <igcewieling> robertmaxrees: I've dabbled in a number of languages over the years so I've encountered variable scopes before.   javascripts is a bit odd though.
[13:26:32] <robertmaxrees> javascript's is probably the simplest imo.
[13:46:27] <mazda3jquery> Guys, how can i compare if( "" == "" )
[13:46:33] <mazda3jquery> it always returns false for empty strings

[14:07:28] <nobitanobi> How can I use toggleClass to switch between two classes, if the classes are in a variable? I have tried toggleClass(myFirstClass mySecondClass) but no luck
[14:07:49] <robertmaxrees> nobitanobi put a comma between them.
[14:07:52] <robertmaxrees> maybe?>
[14:08:02] <nobitanobi> that's not what the doc says
[14:08:24] <robertmaxrees> oh, should be myFirstClass + ' ' + mySecondClass
[14:08:33] <robertmaxrees> though that's kind of an implicit use of that function
[14:09:30] <nobitanobi> yeah...
[14:09:54] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid it personally.

[14:28:46] <mrbubbles> hey guys. I have a for loop. I’m trying to do a fadeout, change the data and then fade in again so I’m using a callback on the fadeout. The problem is that it doesn’t seem to do the fade in again? is the fadeOut callback somehow erased by the for loop?
[14:31:22] <Omar-> ?paste mrbubbles
[14:31:35] <Omar-> hmmm b-ot is ignoring mw
[14:31:37] <Omar-> me*
[14:31:47] <Azrael_-> hi, i've got a problem validating my form. this is the rule i add. it returns a json-object with "answer"=>"true" but the form never submits. if i remove the rule it works just fine. any ideas? http://pastebin.com/NdsBCBb5
[14:31:49] <Omar-> mrbubbles can you create a fiddle?
[14:33:18] <mrbubbles> This is my function: http://pastie.org/9832303
[14:33:57] <mrbubbles> So it iterates through the data set, checks for a div with that class. if it finds one it checks whether the value is changed, then it should fade the element out, change the value and fade it in again..
[14:34:17] <mrbubbles> But for some reason it doesn’t fade in. It correctly outputs the elements to change to the console
[14:43:22] <Dimoff> I have a form which has to be rendered only if js is enabled, in my head I have a redirect wrapped in a <noscript> tag. However, a user can turn off his javascript after the page has loaded. Is there a way to fix this?
[14:44:17] <Omar-> mrbubbles I checked the code, it looks fine
[14:44:23] <Omar-> are you getting any errors?
[14:44:40] <mrbubbles> Nope :(
[14:44:47] <Omar-> Azrael_- maybe "rule" is causing an error
[14:45:14] <Azrael_-> mind to explain?
[14:45:17] <Omar-> mrbubbles I tried to reproduce the issue http://jsfiddle.net/wfkespLd/
[14:45:21] <robertmaxrees> mrbubbles the code doesn't wait for the fade to happen - the loop keeps trucking.
[14:45:38] <Omar-> Azrael_- check your console.log for any errors
[14:46:09] <mrbubbles> What’s strange is that I’m using this to poll. When the page first loads it runs the function and it’s updating all of the values on the page without error. it’s only when I change the value that the API is sending (which should trigger a single value on the page to fadeout, change, fadein that it doesn’t fade in again
[14:46:25] <Azrael_-> Omar-: console.log is empty. this is the ajax-result: {"rows":[],"answer":"true"}
[14:49:00] <mrbubbles> robertmaxrees, Omar-: aaah thanks that may explain it
[14:49:13] <mrbubbles> robertmaxrees: is there anything I can do to make the fadeout work? i like the effect :)
[14:50:28] <robertmaxrees> callbacks.
[14:50:41] <mrbubbles> but I’m using a callback on the fadeout
[14:50:45] <robertmaxrees> animations are async.
[14:50:47] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[14:50:54] <robertmaxrees> no clue then.
[14:51:02] <robertmaxrees> without seeing it and really spending some time on it.
[14:52:10] <Omar-> Azrael_- I'm looking at .rules() function http://jqueryvalidation.org/rules/
[14:55:21] <mrbubbles> Strangely, the last div that is being updated ends up with a random value in it if I use a fadeOut callback. if I just do a straight value replace (without any animation effect) it works fine but the callback makes it have a random value
[14:55:39] <mrbubbles> well, not random, it’s the datestamp (created_at) value of the object - weird!
[14:56:29] <Azrael_-> Omar-: i mostly do it similar to this: http://www.sitepoint.com/jquery-ajax-validation-remote-rule/
[14:58:05] <linagee> What's the best way to do draggable rows? Is there already a standardized way to do this, or should I use a library like this? https://github.com/isocra/TableDnD/blob/master/dist/jquery.tablednd.js
[14:58:38] <Omar-> Azrael_- http://jqueryvalidation.org/remote-method/
[14:58:44] <Azrael_-> ok, found the problem: i returned a json-object but the validation only accepted true/false
[14:58:44] <Omar-> reading this too
[14:59:04] <Omar-> Azrael_- glad you got it solved
[14:59:11] <Azrael_-> thanks for the feedback
[14:59:17] <Omar-> np :)
[15:15:43] <stangeland> when i click add arrow button first time, canvas is placed on top of image. but when i press it second time its placed below the image. why is it not placed on  top of the first canvas? http://jsfiddle.net/hdqbckcx/61/
[15:22:15] <Ayelis> Try positioning absolute instead of relative?
[15:25:36] <Ayelis> It happens the first time because the Vader image div is set to absolute, but the arrow div is not so all arrows after the first are appended to the bottom. Setting the arrow div to absolute fixes the issue for me.
[17:53:40] <jim_j> hi
[17:53:59] <jim_j> what's the best way to delete a div and recreate it to refresh a call within it?
[17:56:53] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:56:57] <robertmaxrees> like a javascript call?
[17:58:12] <jim_j> robertmaxrees, yes, like for an ad, I want to refresh it on click on the page
[17:58:28] <jim_j> is it better to detach or remove the div and recreate it to force a new ad call?
[18:02:26] <robertmaxrees> some ad calls have a "refresh" dingus available
[18:03:31] <jim_j> this is for an onclick event, they have that too?
[18:05:31] <robertmaxrees> i'd check the documentation.
[18:05:38] <robertmaxrees> because all ad call systems are different.
[18:05:49] <jim_j> thanks
[18:49:16] <jimjim> how do I pass this into .then (response)? http://pastebin.com/h6XHwaMa
[18:51:56] <shoky> jimjim: what do you mean?  according to the error message, @store is undefined
[18:55:09] <shoky> jimjim: also i'm not sure but i think you're doing .bind(this) on the return value from .then()  instead of on the function you're passing
[18:56:34] <shoky> jimjim: tho i think you can just use the fat arrow => and it does it automatically for you
[18:59:35] <RegisMark5> Does anyone know why this is getting stuck? : http://jsfiddle.net/0h31v02n/1/
[19:00:25] <RegisMark5> Right now I want this to toggle back and forth and it seems to get stuck.
[19:02:59] <shoky> RegisMark5: because after clicking on Read More, it does element.html(readLessHTML);  putting the readLess link but it doesnt set another handler on this new element
[19:03:25] <Snerf> RegisMark5, the readmore function only runs once
[19:03:37] <shoky> RegisMark5: doing $('.selector').on('click', ... )  only adds an event listener on the specific elements found at that point
[19:03:52] <shoky> (not on any future element that might match that selector)
[19:05:12] <RegisMark5> To get it to run whenever those links are clicked, how should I set up the event?
[19:05:23] <shoky> you can either move to just hiding/showing elements instead of replacing them, or use event delegation like here:  http://jsfiddle.net/0h31v02n/3/
[19:05:58] <RegisMark5> Perfect
[19:06:08] <RegisMark5> Thanks guys
[19:06:50] <shoky> RegisMark5: this is probably a bit more robust.. in case you call readmore() on multiple elements.. http://jsfiddle.net/0h31v02n/5/
[19:41:11] <RegisMark5> It's done! http://jsfiddle.net/0h31v02n/7/
[20:00:54] <igcewieling> I've not seen this before.  clonedHeader = $(".sticky_header", this);    "this" is the element to clone, but what is the selector '.sticky_header' doing in there?
[20:01:55] <shoky> igcewieling: that's the same as   clonedHeader = $(this).find(".sticky_header")    (it doesn't clone anything)
[20:03:20] <igcewieling> Hmm.. perhaps I should find better examples of what I'm looking for 8-|
[20:04:20] <igcewieling> ah, there is clone call later in the code.
[21:55:42] <khon> Hi
[22:02:31] <nights> hi
[22:02:57] <nights> this is part of some javascript that is loaded async
[22:02:59] <nights> $("#page").on("click", ".purchase_button", function(event)
[22:03:06] <nights> it refuses to respond to the click
[22:03:36] <nights> i've used this technique a thousand times before, yet this instance doesnt work... any ideas why?
[22:05:12] <nights> oh, and it's not loaded async
[22:06:06] <nights> but the .purchase_button element is
[22:53:24] <gtristan> jquery documents .click() as an event triggered when the mouse button is pressed and released (which is the normal "click" behavior in most UI toolkits I know of)...
[22:53:39] <gtristan> My question: How do you get the mouse button 'press' event ?
[22:56:18] <Uhkis> trying to do something evil?
[23:19:05] <Cork> gtristan: the mousedown event?
[23:21:24] <gtristan> Cork, yeah I was just told the name of that in #javascript... now I'm trying to get it to actually work ;-)
[23:21:38] <gtristan> any constraints to actually receiving mousedown events that you know of ?
[23:21:49] <Cork> nope
[23:21:55] <Cork> it works much the same as click
[23:22:34] <gtristan> maybe you have to handle it on the innermost element, otherwise it gets eaten up... and stores the down state getting ready to fire a click at button release time ?
[23:22:44] <Cork> nope
[23:22:51] <gtristan> but it's documented to bubble indeed :-/
[23:22:52] <Cork> it bubbles just like click
[23:23:47] <gtristan> I receive it
[23:24:04] <gtristan> I see, my code just isnt working if I handle mousedown, unrelated problem
[23:34:50] <gtristan> Cork, any idea how to get out of this: http://jsfiddle.net/7qr6v3cs/16/ ?
[23:34:58] <gtristan> I know the fiddle is a mess... sorry :-S
[23:35:17] <gtristan> basically the problem is... I need to commit/cancel when the input loses focus
[23:35:57] <gtristan> and if I $().show() the <input> from inside $().mousedown ({ ... })... then I get the sequence: mousedown, focusin, focusout
[23:36:08] <gtristan> before the <input> is ever on screen
[23:36:45] <Cork> uh, how do you focus the input?
[23:38:55] <gtristan> $(input).focus() ?
[23:39:02] <gtristan> that should only focus in no ?
[23:39:18] <gtristan> in my real code I also select the text
[23:39:39] <Cork> sure, but it doesnt
[23:39:49] <Cork> the widget never gets editable
[23:41:43] <gtristan> not sure I get it... http://api.jquery.com/focus/ does have a note to only ever set focus on visible elements
[23:41:59] <gtristan> it needs to be after the reflow or smth ?
[23:42:22] <gtristan> setTimeout (function () { $(input).focus () }, 0); ?
[23:43:03] <gtristan> .focus() does not focus the input ? ... /me thoroughly confused now
[23:58:13] <Cork> gtristan: you can't focus an input that isn't visible
[23:58:49] <gtristan> Cork, with various definitions of visible
[23:59:10] <Nijjan1> -h Who likes this game ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ELS9t3jd8k
[23:59:18] <gtristan> Cork, the setTimeout (function () { ... }, 0) approach fixes it
[23:59:26] <Nijjan1> hey
[23:59:33] <Nijjan1> guys
