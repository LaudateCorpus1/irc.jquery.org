[05:49:51] <troop> cannap, hi. actually i have a question on stackoverflow may i share my link?

[05:50:49] <cannap> ah
[05:50:52] <cannap> this is not a problem
[05:50:59] <cannap> you can post what ever you want
[05:51:01] <cannap> when you need help
[05:52:17] <cannap> can you not add the blur stuff on the outer elements?
[05:52:48] <cannap> like when its active in the input add a listener to body
[05:52:51] <cannap> check what is clicked
[05:52:57] <cannap> and then do the stuff when clicked outside
[05:53:03] <cannap> e.currentTarget or something
[05:53:08] <cannap> check is not the same field
[05:54:05] <cannap> like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/152975/how-do-i-detect-a-click-outside-an-element
[05:57:12] <troop> im looking
[06:02:18] <troop> cannap, so do you mean use outter element's click event instead of input's blur?
[06:02:20] <troop> am i right?
[06:03:14] <cannap> sure
[06:03:18] <cannap> why not
[06:03:20] <troop> alright now i am trying
[06:03:30] <cannap> just add click on the body and check its not the input
[06:03:32] <cannap> as example
[06:03:44] <cannap> when you have focus on the input add a click or something on the body
[06:03:50] <cannap> then when click check if not the input
[06:03:53] <cannap> sry my english sucks hard
[06:04:33] <troop> i understand
[06:06:58] <troop> cannap, thank you! it works for me

[16:36:08] <segurb> hello, how to filter out elements from array by class
[16:48:47] <Captain_Ramius> OK, I surrender. Why is $('#calendar').fullCalendar() "not a function"?
[16:49:38] <Captain_Ramius> (Using fullcalendar.io on jQuery 2.1.3)
[16:57:34] <shoky> Captain_Ramius: either it wasn't loaded properly, or jquery is included twice, or other reasons..
[16:58:13] <Captain_Ramius> Thanks, shoky. That's what I was thinking but I'm having trouble pinning it down
[16:59:40] <shoky> share a live link, or reproduce the issue in a jsfiddle
[17:00:29] <Captain_Ramius> http://pastebin.com/KNGhzxpc
[17:00:51] <Captain_Ramius> I think my <script> loads are all buggered up
[17:06:21] <shoky> Captain_Ramius: that's not really what i asked for ;p and seems fine here  http://jsbin.com/giqoxotumu/1/edit?html,js,output
[17:07:23] <Captain_Ramius> Also here: https://jsfiddle.net/GandalfTheWhite/d37Lmx0f/
[17:07:34] <Captain_Ramius> which works fine!
[17:08:17] <shoky> right..
[17:19:13] <bjsnider> i've got a Uncaught TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'length' in
[17:19:28] <bjsnider> i'm json_encoding it, and then json.parse-ing it
[17:19:48] <bjsnider> it's just a frigging string, it won't allow $.each
[17:19:59] <bjsnider> what would i use instead of $.each?
[17:29:55] <shoky> to do what..?
[17:47:26] <bjsnider> append to an element
[17:50:09] <andywww> you know like on windows’ explorer and mac’s finder you can click on a file, hold shift and click on a file further down and it will highlight all files between the two.. is it possible to do that with a list of checkboxes?
[17:51:03] <andywww> or rephrased, what would be the best way to select a number of checkboxes in a list without having to click each and every box?
[18:02:54] <arc_> sure, it's possible. look up how to do keyboard shortcuts in javascript, but you'll have to just check if shift is being held when somebody clicks a checkbox. when somebody checks a box without holding shift, store the index of that box, then when they shift-click another box, just select .slice(lowindex+1, highindex-1) and check them
[18:02:57] <arc_> something like that anyway
[18:04:21] <arc_> and he leaves
[19:08:42] <bjsnider> how do i select the value of a string in a json response?
[19:09:02] <bjsnider> $(response['name']) isn't working
[19:11:24] <snover> what do you think that is supposed to do?
[19:26:37] <bjsnider> select the string called name
