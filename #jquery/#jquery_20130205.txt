[00:03:38] <dblosevn> hey, if I have 2 items with the same class but one hidden and one visible if I call .toggle on the class it should inverse them right?
[00:04:42] <dblosevn> just wondering if something else is wrong because its definitely not toggling either element
[00:05:42] <dblosevn> I would assume theres not much I could do wrong with this line $('.toggle-main').toggle();
[00:11:07] <greek> Cork: I had to add the tab manually using something like this: $("div#tabs").append("<div id='tab" + num_tabs + "'>Tab " + num_tabs + "</div>"); Any idea why this isn't mentioned in the docs? Anyhow thanks for the help yesterday.
[00:27:19] <devslash> hi
[00:27:36] <devslash> before i ask my question, is anyone actively here
[00:43:54] <Cork> greek: no, no idea
[00:44:16] <Cork> greek: i don't use that plugin my self, i just looked into the code and located why it warned
[00:44:39] <greek> Cork, ok cool. Do you know of who I should chat to regarding the doc?
[00:44:53] <Cork> no clue actually
[00:44:55] <greek> Issue tracker was my best bet
[00:45:12] <Cork> but it should prob be a bugs.jqueryui.com or something
[00:45:18] <greek> Ok thanks
[00:45:39] <Cork> interesting :d
[00:45:47] <Cork> that domain actually exist ^^'
[00:46:19] <greek> Well played
[00:46:19] <grafi> magical
[00:47:30] <Cork> well i based it on what jquery uses
[00:58:10] <computer2000> offtopic but anyone knows a good intro to frontend performance debugging with chrome web inspector?
[00:58:13] <koopajah> Hey everyone! I have a small issue with Opera and I don't understand what happens. I'm loading a form in an iframe with colorbox. When clicking on a button I want to reload the parent page with new arguments in URL so I was using this:    window.top.location.search = $.param(newUrlArgs);      It works in chrome or FF but in Opera it reloads the URL of the iframe
[00:58:22] <marcules> Good Morning :)
[00:58:35] <molavy> hi, i have two div   with overlap  , when i drag an item to one div , in position of overlapping, behind object trigger drop too,
[00:58:35] <molavy> i just want front object detect drop
[00:58:35] <molavy> but both object detect drop and item add to both div
[00:58:52] <molavy> how can i prevent behind div trigger drop
[00:59:38] <koopajah> molavy > is one of the div nested in the other one ?
[01:00:09] <molavy> no, next to first div
[01:01:02] <molavy> koopajah, any idea?
[01:01:03] <marcules> Even if it is a shot in the blind - have you properly closed the divs?
[01:01:32] <molavy> yes
[01:01:51] <koopajah> molavy > Nope, I was thinking of the "greedy" option of droppable() but divs must be nested. I guess you need to have a variable indicating when an element has been dropped already, then if you receive the event drop in the second just cancel it ?
[01:08:14] <devslash> I'm working on this code http://jsfiddle.net/PL4av/ if you click on the music heading it shows artist 1. how can i dynamically add artist 2 to the end of this list ?
[01:08:31] <computer2000> good morning world, please can anyone point me to an introduction to frontend performance debugging with chrome web inspector?
[01:09:45] <devslash> any idea ?
[01:12:37] <devslash> is anyone here
[01:15:03] <koopajah> computer2000 > have you read this : http://www.igvita.com/slides/2012/devtools-tips-and-tricks ?
[01:15:25] <computer2000> koopajah: thx!

[01:18:50] <a55t3risk> @devslash: I would just use $('ul').append
[01:21:20] <fluff_> anyone here good with boostrap?
[01:22:13] <divout> @fluff_ i use it sometime
[01:22:44] <fluff_> divout: im learing, but i have a question

[01:22:58] <mazzachre> I can't get ellipsis text-overflow to work for this one http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/C64Pm/1/ I can figure out it is because the inner div is not cut off at the end of the containing one... but what to do?
[01:23:35] <fluff_> divout: i was reading the tutorial http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#buttonDropdowns, and i see they show like 6 buttons with 6 different colors. Mine is just white. http://jsfiddle.net/qUR76/13/

[01:24:22] <Alina-malina> Hello all! Anyone please help me with jquery uploadify, i install it on my website and it is working, but when i upload 10 files it start working with errors and some files disapear while uploading, please i need to qeue this files and upload then one by one and not all together, how is that possible please help me i am almost 15 hours cant work this out:(((
[01:25:42] <divout> fluff_: checkout the source code of buttons, you need to add classes like 'btn-primar' to  '.btn'
[01:25:58] <fluff_> divout: oh ok thank u
[01:26:13] <fluff_> divout: where do i see all the colors. btn-primary is blue.
[01:26:43] <divout> fluff_: checkout the source code with dev tools
[01:27:52] <fluff_> thank you everyone
[01:28:14] <Alina-malina> anyone?
[01:30:04] <koopajah> Alina-malina > have you tried asking directly on their forum ?
[01:30:15] <Alina-malina> whose forum?
[01:30:23] <koopajah> uploadify ?
[01:31:53] <Alina-malina> oh i mean blueimp not uploadify sorry
[01:32:39] <Alina-malina> http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/   this is the upload system, but when i hit STart upload  it upload all files at once, i want them to upload one by one
[01:34:05] <koopajah> Alina-malina > have you read the documentation ? https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Options  There's the option "limitMultiFileUploads"
[01:34:19] <koopajah> and the other one "limitConcurrentUploads"
[01:35:17] <Alina-malina> dear koopajah thank you for this, but i dont want to limit the number of uploads i want to load for example 10 files and it upload them one by one
[01:36:40] <koopajah> Alina-malina > Have you read the documentation of the two options or not ?
[01:37:09] <Alina-malina> i read it but i dont understand where i should change the options of limitConcurrentUploads
[01:37:19] <koopajah> Alina-malina > "limitConcurrentUploads" : To limit the number of concurrent uploads, set this option to an integer value greater than 0.     So I guess you want to put 1 here to upload file one by one ?
[01:37:53] <Alina-malina> yes thank you Koopajah, but where is this limitConcurrentUploads located? in main.js? i cant find the js file to make the changes
[01:39:11] <Alina-malina> oh i found it, just a second i will try it and come back
[01:39:19] <koopajah> Alina-malina > you must pass this option when you initialize the plugin
[01:39:26] <koopajah> not change it in the source !!
[01:39:41] <Alina-malina> where to pass?
[01:40:00] <Alina-malina> in html?
[01:40:31] <koopajah> Alina-malina > https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/API Check the "options" part
[01:48:37] <divout> //answer_tomyself_myself here is localisation files http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/tags/latest/ui/i18n/
[01:52:38] <Alina-malina> <koopajah>  no i dont get it sorry, should i make chances in jquery.fileupload.js? i change there to 1 but it is still working with errors
[01:57:11] <nbe> hi, I have an issue I was hoping someone could help me with. I have a jquery function listening to a text field with $("#id").on("input"). This works fine. However, I have a Clear search function that does $('#id').val(""). However, this does not trigger the first function. Do I have to trigger this manually?
[01:57:50] <kvarley> I'm posting to a PHP file via $.ajax and JSON is returned, what's the best way to loop through the returned JSOn contained in the "data" variable
[01:58:20] <tlkr> nbe, val() will nto trigger the input event
[01:58:42] <tlkr> use .trigger('input');
[01:59:06] <nbe> tlkr: thanks, I'll give that a shot! :)
[02:00:04] <nbe> tlkr: worked like a charm, many thanks!
[02:00:11] <tlkr> no worrys
[02:00:59] <rogd> hello
[02:01:41] <rogd> how can i make a autocomplete text field update other fields with a multidimentional array from the server?
[02:03:45] <Alina-malina> <koopajah> ok now it is working but rewriting the first image with the same name and after it work fine, i really dont understand this is some mystery for me
[02:06:02] <rogd8> i got dc
[02:09:14] <RET> http://jsfiddle.net/eWJUf/
[02:09:27] <RET> any ideas? mission is in comment of js part :)
[02:09:39] <blade_bobji> ret: whats wrong
[02:10:06] <RET> i need some help on selecting "sister" elements in a change function
[02:10:23] <Cork> RET: why not do a selection for all of them
[02:10:35] <Cork> and then just reuse the object?
[02:11:03] <RET> mhm, and how to filter only these in the same parent fieldset?
[02:11:41] <RET> in the change function i need to check if any field of the same type in the parent fieldset is filled
[02:11:43] <Cork> hmm
[02:12:10] <EdwardIII> hey
[02:12:24] <EdwardIII> how come jquery doesn't store data-* attributes when an element is detached and re-attached to the dom?
[02:12:28] <Cork> RET: well you could do .filter(function() { retturn this.parentNode == parent; })
[02:12:55] <RET> Cork: its not the direct parent :(
[02:13:11] <Cork> then $(this).closest('fieldset')[0]
[02:13:14] <RET> and in my example the parent is the div in the fieldset i want to check
[02:13:31] <RET> mhm
[02:13:37] <Cork> that just changes what element to search for
[02:14:11] <blade_bobji>  someone please help me. im building my website and im playing around with twtter bootstrap button drop up menus. whne you put your mouse over a link in the menu, the blue background doesn't go the full way. can somone please help , my website is http://lolplanet.net/
[02:14:13] <RET> and how to select the elements with the same selector (without repeating the selector itself?)
[02:16:26] <xec> EdwardIII: i thought it did - do you have a demo?
[02:18:24] <RET> is there a function that returns the used selector?
[02:20:40] <Cork> RET: yes, but its kinda internal
[02:20:54] <RET> $(this).selector is empty
[02:21:12] <Cork> ah
[02:21:17] <Cork> you can't run it on this
[02:21:21] <Cork> as this is just a dom element
[02:21:26] <EdwardIII> xec: you're right, must be something specifically wrong with my code. here an example is of it working fine: http://jsfiddle.net/HSC6M/
[02:21:30] <Cork> you have to run it on the original jquery object
[02:22:15] <RET> ah okay :(
[02:22:49] <EdwardIII> xec: hrm weird, it is actually working ok in my local code, but i don't see the data-* attributes in inspect element on chrome
[02:23:06] <xec> EdwardIII: are you using the .data() method to store data?
[02:23:07] <Cork> EdwardIII: $el.detach().prependTo('#container'); <-- detach makes little sense as you already attach it to an element
[02:23:25] <Cork> (an element can only have one parent)
[02:23:34] <xp_prg2> hi all, I have some embed code from a site that does live streaming, I want to dynamically put this in my web page I don't understand the easiest way to do this, I know what the <script>stuff</script> ends up putting in the web page which is an object, do I use document.createElement('object'); ?
[02:23:40] <EdwardIII> xec: yeah
[02:23:59] <xec> EdwardIII: ok - .data() does not write to data-* attributes
[02:24:09] <EdwardIII> xec: ... whoa
[02:24:18] <xec> it does, however, read them - once
[02:24:25] <EdwardIII> mind = blown
[02:24:39] <xec> ?data
[02:24:46] <Cork> bots down
[02:24:48] <xec> ?NOBOTSNACK
[02:25:17] <EdwardIII> Cork: i'm trying to move an element so i figure i need to detach it first?
[02:25:22] <Cork> no
[02:25:32] <Cork> attaching moves unless you clone the element
[02:25:38] <RET> Cork: ok then ill extract the selector to make it everywhere the same where i need it
[02:25:40] <RET> thnaks
[02:25:45] <RET> *thanks
[02:26:00] <Cork> EdwardIII: and that might actually be what you want?
[02:26:04] <EdwardIII> Cork: ah ha, i didn't realise that
[02:26:09] <Cork> get a new dom element without its data?
[02:26:17] <EdwardIII> Cork: nope, i want to keep the data
[02:26:28] <Cork> and your example does?
[02:26:33] <Cork> (at least for me)
[02:26:55] <EdwardIII> Cork: sure - i see why you're confused, i was just working up an original example under the assumption it didn't, then was suprised when it did
[02:27:03] * Cork nods
[02:27:28] <EdwardIII> really i'm just trying to move elements around in a ul
[02:27:36] <Cork> EdwardIII: btw, the jquery data store uses the dom elements internal id (not the id attribute) to find the data you store
[02:27:42] <EdwardIII> but i want to be able to reset them to their original position too
[02:28:13] <Cork> you could use hasData?
[02:28:23] <Cork> to see if it has been moved, and if it has, don't overwrite it
[02:28:56] <Cork> ah, wait that only checks if it has any data
[02:29:22] <EdwardIII> this is what i have so far: http://jsfiddle.net/dVFax/
[02:29:25] <Cork> so $(this).data('biscuits') !== undefined
[02:29:58] * Cork nods
[02:30:26] <EdwardIII> although that reset should have hasData instead of just checking for true, because sometimes an element can have index of 0
[02:30:32] <EdwardIII> so thanks for that pointer!
[02:30:43] <Cork> hasData is wrong
[02:30:53] <Cork> you want to check the specific value
[02:31:04] <Cork> data('old-index') === undefined
[02:31:17] <Cork> cause else its enough if anyone adds any data value to the element
[02:31:25] <EdwardIII> right you are
[02:31:42] <Cork> well it was me who said it wrong from the start ^^'
[02:31:52] <rogd8> how can i make a autocomplete text field update other fields with a multidimentional array from the server?
[02:35:11] <EdwardIII> ok i've got a test case here where my code isn't working as i'd expect, if i click cornholio, then butthead i'd expect cornholio to go back to the bototm of the list: http://jsfiddle.net/dVFax/1/
[02:35:41] <koopajah> Hey everyone! I have an issue with "window.top.location.search" in Opera from within an iFrame. Can someone help me with this please?
[02:35:53] <Cork> rogd8: tried looking at the documentation?
[02:36:06] <rogd8> theres lots of it
[02:36:19] <Cork> uh http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/ <--
[02:36:28] <Cork> "Multiple values"
[02:37:11] <Cork> koopajah: if you want help ask the question, not for a persion
[02:37:14] <Cork> *person
[02:37:50] <Cork> koopajah: that means ask the full question instead for waiting for someone to ask for the details
[02:38:12] <rogd8> ah
[02:39:49] <koopajah> Cork > sorry yeah. So I'm loading an iframe with colorbox. When I click on a button in the iframe I want to reload the parent page, changing its URL arguments. "window.parent.location.search = $.param(urlArgs);" works in Chrome and FF but in Opera if reloads the iframe URL in the parent page. I have no idea why
[02:40:48] <Cork> koopajah: prob a limitation in the browser
[02:41:22] <Cork> it always works against the current window object
[02:41:35] <koopajah> Cork > What do you mean  ?
[02:42:47] <Cork> koopajah: that window.parent.location uses window as its owner window
[02:43:05] <Cork> so it picks the wrong url
[02:43:13] <Cork> btw, this is just me guessing
[02:43:20] <koopajah> Cork > not really no because if I alert window.parent.location.pathname  it displays the proper URL
[02:43:37] <Cork> ya, but thats returns
[02:43:42] <Cork> not when it sets it internally
[02:44:13] <Cork> simplest way to solve that would prob be to use sendMessage and do the change on the parent page instead
[02:44:15] <EdwardIII> hrm i'm confused, my code is looking sexy to me
[02:44:21] <bad> my bootstrap dropdown menubar hover doesn't show the full length and therefore is bugging. whats the solution: http://uploadnow.org/image/344240-snapshot6.png
[02:44:36] <koopajah> Cork > yeah but still no. Setting window.parent.location to a new URL works fine. it's setting window.top.location.search that does not work
[02:44:38] <Alina-malina> Everyone, i have  blueimp installed on my website and with koopajah help i figure out my problem, but now i have another one, when i do multiupload, the file which is on the first qeue it rewrite the name to second one and then continue to name them, please tell me what i am doing wrong?? http://imgur.com/qJAsnjl
[02:44:47] <Cork> koopajah: but if you want to know more exactly you should try asking in #opera instead
[02:45:04] <Cork> as it sounds like a bug in there system
[02:45:12] <koopajah> Cork > I've tried, but no answer. Same on StackOverflow! But thanks for checking anyway
[02:45:45] <Cork> koopajah: didn't really check, just compared it to what i know of the globals structure used by the open source platforms
[02:45:53] <Cork> as in != ie and opera
[02:48:55] <Alina-malina> if i upload them one by one it work without problem, but if i use start upload button it rewrite the second file with first one and then continue working perfectly, please anyone help me
[02:49:02] <Alina-malina> http://imgur.com/qJAsnjl
[02:49:42] <Alina-malina> it seems like it is trying to upload the first 2 images at once and then continue to upload one by one? why is that?
[02:50:02] <milligan> if I change the html of a div to contain an <input type text, shouldn't the text be submitted with the containing form upon submission?
[02:50:22] <Cork> milligan: if it has a name yes
[02:50:56] <Alina-malina> something paranormal in my problem:(
[02:51:06] <koopajah> milligan > did you give a "name" to your input ?
[02:51:28] <milligan> koopajah, yep.
[02:51:28] <Alina-malina> <koopajah> Please help!
[02:51:53] <koopajah> Alina-malina > I don't know sorry, try asking on stackoverflow or mailing the person providing the plugin
[02:54:27] <milligan> koopajah, Cork , it's a bit strange. I have an onclick method that changes the html from an <a href to an <input text .. and back if the user clicks a cancel button. That works perfectly, and values are retained through them both. However, when I submit the form and iterate the submitted keys, I cannot see the <input field being sent.
[02:55:10] <Cork> milligan: might be you run your selector before the new input field is there
[02:55:20] <bad> Cork: are u good with bootstrap
[02:55:24] <Cork> milligan: could you fiddle it?
[02:55:29] <Cork> bad: not really
[02:55:38] <bad> cork: ok
[02:55:39] <Cork> i've used it a bit, but not much
[02:55:43] <bad> cork: ok
[02:56:04] <milligan> Cork, the selector does its job .. and the field gets created with a value as expected. It's only when I click the submit button the value is lost.
[02:56:46] <koopajah> milligan > can you show the code creating the input ?
[02:56:52] <milligan> Yep, one sec
[02:57:43] <milligan> koopajah, Cork , these are the two methods that enable/disable stuff, and change the html. http://pastebin.com/3hF9pdQu
[02:58:17] <milligan> Cork, koopajah , those two methods work as intended. I think. At least visually and values are retained as I want.
[03:01:24] <Cork> milligan: but you're removing the input field
[03:01:42] <Cork> when you do disableItem
[03:01:55] <milligan> Cork, yep. But I don't disable items on the submit.
[03:02:02] <Cork> ah
[03:02:15] <Cork> though that pb doesn't help much
[03:02:27] <Cork> the generated dom structure before submit is whats needed
[03:02:37] <Cork> is the submit ajax or plain html?
[03:02:42] <bad> any1 good with bootstrap?
[03:02:43] <Cork> s/html/http/
[03:02:48] <milligan> plain form submission
[03:03:02] <milligan> <input type=submit submitting contained form.
[03:03:04] <Cork> ya, then check the generated dom structure in an inspector
[03:03:27] <Cork> to make sure the input field is inside the <form> tag
[03:03:39] <Cork> and that its really still there when you do the submit
[03:04:06] <Cork> cause thats basically the only thing that could cause that
[03:06:18] <keirlav87> i have an object method which returns an integer, however when place the methods value into a variable, the method itself turns into a property of the returned value, if that makes sense?
[03:06:27] <milligan> hmmm .. It looks like I might be losing a </form> on the way .. but it's there in my code. An interesting search indeed :) I'll be back with my result.
[03:06:44] <keirlav87> obj.method = function() { return 128; }
[03:06:52] <keirlav87> var int = obj.method()
[03:07:06] <keirlav87> obj.method is no longer a function - it is an integer containing the number 128
[03:07:12] <keirlav87>  property*
[03:07:36] <Cork> your looking for var int = obj.method; ?
[03:08:18] <Cork> js> var obj = { method: function() { return 128; } }; var int = obj.method(); print(obj.method); print(int);
[03:08:22] <b-ot> Cork: function () {
[03:08:27] <Cork> uh...
[03:08:37] <Cork> man, that bot is stupid...
[03:08:43] <Cork> js> var obj = { method: function() { return 128; } }; var int = obj.method(); print(int);
[03:08:46] <b-ot> Cork: 128
[03:08:52] <Cork> js> var obj = { method: function() { return 128; } }; var int = obj.method; print(int);
[03:08:54] <b-ot> Cork: function () {
[03:12:55] <milligan> Cork, in the dom explorer, the form appears to close itself before including any elements. When running the page, it executes fine, submitting all items but the newly generated one. (DOM: <form ...></form><tr> elements.... </tr>)
[03:13:30] <keirlav87> basically i want var int to contain the value returned by my objects method while still retaining the method in the object

[03:13:59] <jnhghy> Hi, I have a script that runs in about 1min-1min20sec. All this time the page is white. I'd like to place a progress bar that will last 1min30sec and that will go away when the script is ready to display the content. is this possible?
[03:15:30] <NoWired> jnhghy, try to show a gif image of "loading" before, and when all is visible, hide it
[03:16:19] <jnhghy> NoWired, how can I display a gif image on a page before the php code is totally run? usually images are the last to load....
[03:16:40] <keirlav87> the php or js?
[03:17:02] <NoWired> is php or js? I think that it was on js ...
[03:17:20] <jnhghy> sorry, the script that takes a lot of time is in php
[03:17:40] <jnhghy> my mistake :)
[03:17:44] <keirlav87> what does the script do?
[03:18:00] <NoWired> jnhghy, see "ob_start" on php.net
[03:18:33] <jnhghy> generates some charts, verifies some entries and all this starting beeing called from another page throw window.open, it should be only a progress bar and a confirmation message ....
[03:18:45] <jnhghy> NoWired: thanks for the point out
[03:18:45] <keirlav87> Cork: did i explain clearly the issue i was having, sorry i didnt really understand the example you were trying to show me
[03:19:49] <keirlav87> a minute is a long time for a user to wait - can your script not be broken down into smaller modules and use ajax to fetch data?
[03:20:06] <molavy> i want when a user click on item animate drag show up and item go to an droppable object,how can i show drag animation when a user click on item that has draggable method
[03:20:41] <milligan> Cork, found the problem. I have messed up my dom, pretty much.
[03:21:05] <NoWired> I see this tool on internet http://davidlynch.org/projects/maphilight/docs I need something like this, but, when I try to use the "tools" for convert a svg to a html image, I allways get the same error "pyparsing is required", someone knows any tool like this?
[03:34:43] <liox_> hello, can anyone tell me why this error? Error: Permission denied to access property 'toString'
[03:34:45] <Alina-malina> http://imgur.com/qJAsnjl  please help, i tried their google-forum and wrote to its author, but there is nothing new, it seems like it is trying to upload the first 2 images at the same time
[03:36:41] <gazzwi86> I'm looking for a plugin to create a dial like this one: http://tutorialzine.com/2011/11/pretty-switches-css3-jquery/
[03:36:56] <gazzwi86> but this one is a little bit buggy on mobile / touch devices
[03:38:15] <mazzachre> http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/C64Pm/1/ Is it possible to get the "ellipsis" to work as expected on this?
[03:38:38] <Cork> keirlav87: sorry got busy
[03:39:32] <Cork> keirlav87: that is what you should have normally, unless you actually replace the method on the original object
[03:40:07] <Cork> keirlav87: so the problem your explaining doesn't match what you say you do -- it can't cause that problem unless the js engine is really broken
[03:40:23] <Cork> keirlav87: so check so you really never modify the original object
[03:41:15] <keirlav87> yeah sorry i figured it out, I was overwriting the object by doing var newObj = oldObj;  newObj.value = oldObj.method() - really silly!
[03:41:29] <keirlav87> not exactly that but you get the gist :p
[03:41:36] <Cork> mazzachre: you would have to add spaces to the element instead of moving an element
[03:41:45] <Cork> :)
[03:41:48] <Cork> classic
[03:42:19] <Cork> and yes, i've been there my self a few times ^^'
[03:43:41] <keirlav87> my understanding is that creating a variable that contains an object already in existence points to the same piece of memory as if you were amending the object itself?
[03:43:57] <keirlav87> my limited understanding i should say :p
[03:44:51] <molavy> i want when a user click on item animate drag show up and item go to an droppable object,how can i show drag animation when a user click on item that has draggable method
[03:50:02] <c00kiemon5ter> hmm, if I am poking at localStorage a key that may be missing
[03:50:06] <c00kiemon5ter> I get null
[03:50:12] <c00kiemon5ter> should I compare with == or === ?
[03:50:43] <Cork> keirlav87: variables that is an object is a reference to an object yes
[03:51:00] <Cork> keirlav87: so js object variables is close to pointers in other languages
[03:51:16] <Cork> (the variable only holds a memory location, not the actual data)
[03:54:32] <Misan> hi
[03:54:52] <Misan> jquery allows to select also classes, right?
[03:58:11] <Misan> so I can do something like $(function() { $( ".resizable" ).resizable(); });   to create a toolset
[04:01:44] <Cork> Misan: yes you can select most every selector you can use in a css file
[04:02:26] <Misan> oh, thank you cork, Do i have to put that function within a $(document).ready(function() {}); or no function at all?
[04:03:19] <Cork> Misan: depends on where you call it
[04:04:00] <Misan> well, I assign the class resizable to one of my content elements :o
[04:05:05] <Cork> uh
[04:05:16] <Cork> are you running the code from a script tag in the header
[04:05:19] <Cork> from an event
[04:05:32] <Cork> or from the bottom of the body element?
[04:05:38] <Misan> bottom :)
[04:05:46] <Cork> then no you don't need the wrapper
[04:06:08] <Misan> Ah I see.
[04:06:45] <Alina-malina> anyone please help me with my issue? http://imgur.com/qJAsnjl
[04:07:00] <Cork> Misan: that wrapper is for waiting for DOMContentLoaded or Load (in DOMContentLoaded doesn't exist)
[04:07:16] <Misan> Yep that makes sense :)
[04:07:20] <Cork> Misan: and if you add the code to the bottom of the page, it won't be parsed until that happens
[04:16:01] <mazzachre> Cork: Uhm... Add spaces? So something like adding padding-left to the inner div?
[04:17:40] <mazzachre> If I set height: 0 on something, is it still considered shown? So it will still have a width etc?
[04:20:54] <mazzachre> Cork: Hmm.. padding does not help... I am not sure I follow what would be the idea? You say it is a classic, I have not found anything to help me... But maybe I am not searching well?
[04:21:59] <iaj> Have you guys any tricks upon the sleeve to prevent forms to be submitted twice?
[04:35:40] <Cork> mazzachre: no not paddin
[04:35:49] <Cork> mazzachre: i meant litteral spaces
[04:35:53] <Cork> &nbsp;
[04:36:11] <mazzachre> o.O
[04:36:26] <Cork> and yes that makes what your trying to do hard
[04:36:32] <mazzachre> How to... uhm...
[04:37:19] <mazzachre> Uhm... Could I perhaps set the size? Somthing like container width - how much I move the contained left?!
[04:37:25] <mazzachre> width...

[04:51:42] <NoWired> someone knows any application to create an interactive map for a image, to can use it with javascript?
[05:00:29] <pingec> Why won't $.grep() work on an object that stores key-value pairs?
[05:00:35] <pingec> http://jsfiddle.net/Sk5uS/
[05:00:42] <pingec> While $.map seems to iterate fine
[05:04:11] <Anticom2> pingec not sure but you're feeding it with an object and not with an array
[05:04:23] <Anticom2> maybe .grep() doesn't accept objects
[05:04:39] <the_dark_knight> join #pythonindia
[05:04:44] <pingec> I know that
[05:04:47] <the_dark_knight> join #pythonindia
[05:04:57] <pingec> I just wonder why .map would and .grep not
[05:05:57] <Anticom2> hmm jsfiddle is slow as hell
[05:06:15] <Anticom2> am i the only one?
[05:07:23] <pingec> Anticom2 I noticed that too yesterday
[05:07:34] <pingec> It was even unavailable for 15minuts
[05:07:41] <Alina-malina> Nevermind i solve everything, thank you for everyone who tried and helped to me!
[05:09:49] <Anticom2> http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/jsfiddle.net :(
[05:10:37] <geiregjo> :p
[05:10:40] <geiregjo> here also
[05:11:10] <Anticom2> hoewver pingec try this http://pastie.org/6056667
[05:11:19] <Anticom2> i'm rly not sure what's going on but maybe that'll help
[05:11:34] <Anticom2> oh and good lord get a proper console and don't use alert ;)
[05:11:45] <brantje> jsfiddle down?
[05:11:52] <Anticom2> thank's captain obvious :D
[05:11:57] <Anticom2> seems like, yea

[05:12:35] <the_dark_knight> Hi, Using this - http://www.bpaste.net/show/BTh8t25mRpX5R72KDjCN/ data and converting it to something like - http://www.bpaste.net/show/sCXXOr4rxoBuA9oIebyE/ . I wan't to design a UI like http://jsfiddle.net/ultraloveninja/xBxa4/5/ . How do I do that? any ideas. Please help
[05:20:04] <Anticom2> so your data is hierarchical the_dark_knight ?
[05:22:04] <Anticom2> if so, i recommend dynatree http://wwwendt.de/tech/dynatree/doc/samples.html
[05:24:11] <drcable> Hey, I'm using the jquery UI .autocomplete() function on a page served from localhost:8080, with the source option set to a a string to be used as a url, as per the docs.  The set url is another page on localhost:8080. I'm getting cross-origin errors when the autocomplete makes it's requests- code: http://pastebin.com/P0A8GQee and error: http://pastebin.com/KiHL0Xe0 . Am i missing something?
[05:24:36] <the_dark_knight> Anticom2: what input does it take?
[05:24:54] <Anticom2> afaik it has an ajax module
[05:25:33] <Anticom2> the_dark_knight http://wwwendt.de/tech/dynatree/doc/dynatree-doc.html#h4.2.4
[05:28:05] <Teduardo> hey hey, is there any way to add the selected="selected" tag onto an item in a <Select> based on the .val?
[05:29:00] <brantje> if val == $('.selector')attr('selected','selected')
[05:29:06] <Anticom2> $('select option[value=WHATEVERIWANT]').attr('selected', 'selected');
[05:29:20] <brantje> indeed
[05:29:23] <Anticom2> :P
[05:29:28] <systemfault> Using prop is sexier.
[05:29:36] <brantje> xD
[05:29:38] <Anticom2> ty
[05:29:47] <the_dark_knight> Anticom2: Basically I will only have lenght 2 hierarchy. here ex. 3 folders, folder1, 2, 3 having any number of files. But these folders won't have folders inside them. All I have is the table from my db - http://www.bpaste.net/show/BTh8t25mRpX5R72KDjCN/. How do I covert that data to json http://www.bpaste.net/show/sCXXOr4rxoBuA9oIebyE/
[05:30:15] <Anticom2> Teduardo keep in mind that you've got to use .removeAttr('selected') to kind of unselect it again... doing .attr('selected', '') won't do the trick
[05:30:37] <Teduardo> Does anyone have an example? i'm piss poor with jquery/javascript =)
[05:30:49] <the_dark_knight> Anticom2: after I have the data, I will be able to implement it dynatree
[05:31:11] <Anticom2> the_dark_knight read the api docs of dynatree to get your array in php to the required structure... then do "echo json_encode($myData);"
[05:31:40] <liox_> someone already used the plugin SmoothDivScroll?
[05:31:41] <systemfault> Teduardo: $('#mySelect option[value="10"]').prop('selected', true);
[05:32:43] <geiregjo> Anyone with some JQM grid experience?
[05:33:04] <geiregjo> I'm creating a list with listitems that contain a 3 column grid
[05:33:23] <geiregjo> The 2 outer columns have a fixed with but the middle column should take up the remaining space
[05:33:30] <Anticom2> Teduardo trial and error shall be your example ;)
[05:33:42] <geiregjo> | A | BBBBBBBBB | C |
[05:34:03] <geiregjo> I can set the fixed width of A and C but B just takes the space it needs
[05:34:11] <geiregjo> i doesn't take the 100%

[05:34:43] <krusty_ar> hi all, what would be a nice way to write an each loop that "chains" a series of $.ajax() calls in a when().then() construct? all the examples I find just explicitly pass the promises to when()
[05:34:55] <Anticom2> since so many ppl asket about truncating text: http://www.examplet.buss.hk/jquery/truncator.php in case someone of those is reading this. just found that one by accident. looks sexy
[05:35:05] <alexises> hi
[05:35:20] <systemfault> krusty_ar: You use then for that, when is for parallel calls
[05:35:33] <krusty_ar> systemfault: yes I understand the promise part
[05:35:44] <alexises> i would like to know if a select have an option with the '' value
[05:35:47] <alexises> howto do this
[05:35:58] <alexises> i know the corresponding select with his id
[05:36:18] <krusty_ar> systemfault:  just looking for a way to use when() when the promises are generated inside a loop, let me gist that for you
[05:36:39] <alexises> i have try this : $('#id option:value=\'\').length
[05:36:43] <systemfault> alexises: Try $('#my-select option[value=""]').length > 0
[05:37:01] <alexises> thenks ;)
[05:37:07] <Misan> grr.. on codepen and jsfiddle,  resizable works... in my own websites - it does not D:
[05:37:51] <Anticom2> Misan checked firebug?
[05:38:42] <krusty_ar> systemfault: https://gist.github.com/krusty/4714507 nevermind the current callback to get, what I want is to create a new callback when _all_ ajax calls finish
[05:38:57] <Anticom2> oh and Misan clear ur cache... just recently had a caching problem that cost me 2 hours where i was trying to find the issue with my scripts... in the end it turned out that ff cached the old crap and i didn't get to see the working bits
[05:39:23] <Misan> thank you, will check that
[05:39:26] <Anticom2> krusty_ar is that even possible?
[05:39:32] <systemfault> krusty_ar: I would use .map with $.when.apply
[05:39:35] <Anticom2> since it's async
[05:39:38] <krusty_ar> Anticom2: yes, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[05:39:58] <systemfault> krusty_ar: Need an example?
[05:40:03] <Anticom2> hrr hrr
[05:40:06] <krusty_ar> systemfault: I think so
[05:40:51] <Teduardo> systemfault: thanks that is so choice
[05:40:57] <Misan> no Anticom2, still not working.  I could send you a testcase :P but I fear that would work
[05:40:58] <krusty_ar> systemfault: you mean store all promises in an array and pass that to when? that was my first idea actually, does when accepts the array or I need to explode it?
[05:41:28] <Anticom2> Misan checked ur network tab to make sure jq get's loaded properly and u don't have a typo in your src?
[05:41:46] <Misan> it does load
[05:42:23] <Anticom2> hmm
[05:42:25] <Anticom2> i'm puzzled
[05:42:27] <krusty_ar> Anticom2: I strongly recommend this book to anyone that already feels comfortable with js http://pragprog.com/book/tbajs/async-javascript
[05:42:27] <systemfault> krusty_ar: Yeah, that's what I mean… but no it doesn't accept an array by default but JS has something for that
[05:42:28] <systemfault> krusty_ar: It's .apply
[05:42:33] <krusty_ar> you are right
[05:42:43] <systemfault> krusty_ar: So, $.when.apply(myArrayOfPromises).done(…….
[05:42:53] <Anticom2> krusty_ar is it on amazon?
[05:43:05] <krusty_ar> thank you very much systemfault
[05:43:05] <systemfault> krusty_ar: You're welcome
[05:43:10] <systemfault> Errr.. i meant.. $.when.apply(null, myArrayOfPromises).done(…….
[05:43:54] <krusty_ar> Anticom2: I don't think so, but the pragmatic programmers are good people, you can give them your card number :D
[05:44:53] <Anticom2> krusty_ar wanted to add it to my whish list
[05:45:04] <krusty_ar> good point :D
[05:45:06] <Anticom2> but i might take a look at it anyway :)
[05:50:26] <Misan> Anticom2, do you maybe wan't to take a look on the website I applied resizable? I just can't find out what the problem is :P it all loads properly.
[05:52:07] <Misan> I am puzzled aswell
[05:53:15] <Quest> iam using http://keith-wood.name/datepick.html and am new to javascript. how can i make the inline calendar appear onclick on an image or div?
[05:56:22] <fris> how can i tell if pjax is working on a site
[05:57:01] <systemfault> You look at your web inspector?
[05:57:27] <Quest> me?
[05:57:45] <systemfault> fris :/
[05:57:58] <Quest> k
[05:58:17] <Quest> is my question too difficult?
[05:58:53] <systemfault> Quest: No, too basic...
[05:59:08] <systemfault> Quest: It's written in the documentation, the "invocation" tab
[05:59:29] <systemfault> See on that tab the "From an Image only" code
[05:59:34] <fris> systemfault where should i be looking in inspect element?
[05:59:46] <systemfault> fris: Do you use chrome?
[06:00:00] <fris> ya
[06:00:16] <systemfault> Then open the web dev tools on the "Console" tab
[06:00:47] <systemfault> Right-click anywhere in the white area then make sure you click on "Log XmlHttpRequests"
[06:01:11] <Quest> systemfault,  no no. i need it to appear on an image/div click.
[06:01:17] <systemfault> fris: So now, if you leave the console open, everything an ajax call is made, you'll see it
[06:01:20] <Quest> systemfault,  not date picking. but for inline
[06:02:10] <systemfault> Quest: Then I don't understand the question, sorry
[06:03:43] <Quest> systemfault,  I dont want to pick a date. i just want the calendar to appear when the user click on an image or div
[06:04:23] <systemfault> It's a datepicker… not sure what else it's supposed to do..
[06:04:37] <systemfault> If you want a calendar then look for a calendar plugin
[06:05:04] <Quest> systemfault,  see Inline datepicker (div/span):      in the introduction tab.
[06:05:06] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/2SgSs/ guys would this be betetr done with canvas/svg?
[06:05:39] <Quest> systemfault,  Its displaying a calendar. right? i want the same thing but only appearing on a click on a div/ image
[06:05:43] <systemfault> Quest: Then click the "Show Code" button beside it?
[06:05:53] <Pal> Hi Hi...how to get date and times based on timezone. My current  date and time is Date {Tue Feb 05 2013 19:27:17 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)}
[06:06:05] <Quest> systemfault,  yes. but how to make it appear on a div click?
[06:06:09] <Pal> How can is see US HST time.
[06:06:19] <Anticom2> nFFF depends on how you want to deal with compatibilty
[06:06:30] <systemfault> Quest: Add the code to a click event handler?
[06:06:48] <Anticom2> i'd love to do canvas/svg but we got to maintain IE6 support and i couldn't find anything
[06:06:53] <Anticom2> so i went with image maps aswell
[06:06:56] <Quest> systemfault,  yes. i think that was my question. how to do that?
[06:06:58] <nFFF> Wait the images dont even load
[06:07:00] <nFFF> moment
[06:07:03] <Pal> or  PST  time. GMT +15
[06:07:07] <Pal> or  PST  time. GMT +05
[06:08:44] <systemfault> Pal: Usually, you would send the date from the server in a nice format like ISO8601 then on the client, you could use a nice date/time lib like moment.js to localize your "time"
[06:08:56] <systemfault> Pal: Not sure if that helps.
[06:09:08] <shomon> hi, what is the best way to restrict entry to 2 fields within a textbox? I want people to only be able to enter numeric year/month in it
[06:09:22] <shomon> as it's within drupal I cant' get it working unless it's a textbox or some standard element...
[06:11:25] <Pal> ISO8601 format like GMT or enterally  diff
[06:11:48] <Pal> Right now i following GMT
[06:12:12] <manuelbieh_> is there a way to have an event handler temporarily "deactivate" other event handlers without completely unbinding them?
[06:12:18] <sCoRpi> shomon: you could register a keydown event maybe and check the length of the input
[06:12:34] <sCoRpi> shomon: but you should definitely add serverside validation
[06:12:44] <manuelbieh_> $('a.specialTreatment').on('click', handler1);
[06:12:45] <manuelbieh_> $('a').on('click', handler2);
[06:13:27] <manuelbieh_> is it possible to have handler2 not executed when handler1 has already been called?
[06:13:30] <shomon> sure, that's fine.. but ages ago I saw something in jquery that let you restrict entry to text fields according to "__/__" for example - so only 2 in each
[06:14:54] <Quest> systemfault,  yes. i think that was my question. how to do that?
[06:15:46] <systemfault> Quest: 1) Learn how to write a click handler  2) Call the calendar function from within it 3) … 4) Profit!
[06:16:29] <Quest> 4.?
[06:17:00] <shomon> I'm more interested in 3)
[06:22:41] <koopajah> manuelbieh_ > did you check stopImmediatePropagation() ?
[06:23:37] <maiagallo> if I have something like <div><label>foo</label>bar</div>, how can I change bar, without touching the label and its contents? thanks
[06:24:45] <systemfault> maiagallo: You can't without pure JS..
[06:25:03] <systemfault> maiagallo: If you can change the markup… put bar in a span or something
[06:26:29] <maiagallo> systemfault: I can change the markup. If there's no easy way to do this with jquery I guess that that's how I should go... thanks!
[06:28:36] <Quest> systemfault,  <div onClick="datepick({onSelect: showDate})"> doesnt work
[06:28:56] <systemfault> Quest: You really need to learn Javascript… the jQuery
[06:29:02] <systemfault> s/the/then
[06:29:20] <Quest> s/the/then?
[06:30:07] <systemfault> means: substitute "the" with "then" in my last sentence.
[06:31:24] <Quest> oh
[06:32:00] <NodeX> onClick :(
[06:32:17] <Quest> onclick
[06:32:33] <NodeX> dont use inline handlers, they're bad
[06:32:50] <Quest> NodeX,  nor does <div onclick="datepick()"> help
[06:33:03] <NodeX> that's an INLINE handler
[06:33:08] <Quest> NodeX,  iam new the JS and i didnt wrote the calender code. so what should i do?
[06:33:22] <NodeX> reference it and bind to it
[06:33:27] <Quest> NodeX,  i want that calender to appear when a div is cliced
[06:33:40] <Quest> NodeX, how
[06:34:12] <NodeX> <div id="somediv"></div> ..... <script>$(document).ready(function(){$("#somediv").click(function(){datepick();});})</script>
[06:35:04] <Quest> hm
[06:35:24] <manuelbieh_> koopajah stopImmediatePropagation works fine, thank you!
[06:35:46] <NodeX> and don't listen to systemfault : he is retarded and has no clue what he is doing
[06:38:21] <Quest> NodeX,  did that. but not working on click
[06:40:00] <Quest> NodeX, http://pastie.org/6059672
[06:40:48] <NodeX> $("#somediv").datepick();
[06:40:50] <NodeX> instead
[06:43:45] <Quest> NodeX,  now its visible regardless of click  <script>$(document).ready(function(){$("#somediv").datepick();})</script>
[06:46:06] <Quest> NodeX,  you there?/
[06:46:20] <AdamPDotty> <script>$(document).ready(function(){$("#somediv").click(datepick);});</script>
[06:48:31] <Quest> AdamPDotty,  now if i click somediv, no calender appears
[06:49:16] <Quest> http://pastie.org/6059927
[06:51:55] <Quest> NodeX,  AdamPDotty  what could be wrong?
[06:54:51] <Misan> Anticom2, I found what's the matter
[06:54:57] <Anticom2> tell me
[06:55:26] <Misan> because I do post requests to that container, it will overwrite the handles jquery-ui set for it :P
[06:55:51] <Anticom2> aw
[06:55:54] <Anticom2> awkward
[06:56:06] <Misan> yup, which is why it worked in the testcase
[06:59:57] <Quest> AdamPDotty,  NodeX  this doesnot work either <script>$(document).ready(function(){$("#somediv").click(datepick({onSelect: showDate}));});</script>
[07:00:22] <AdamPDotty> cant work with brackets
[07:00:36] <AdamPDotty> datepick() is the result of the datepick-function
[07:01:04] <AdamPDotty> if you want it like that, you have to wrap it with anonymous function(){}
[07:01:29] <AdamPDotty> (inside click() )
[07:02:44] <Quest> hm
[07:04:16] <systemfault> Quest: Something like $(document).ready(function(){$("#somediv").click(function() { datepick({onSelect: showDate}); } );});
[07:04:36] <systemfault> Quest: See the extra "function() {"         "}" ?
[07:08:54] <juha_> if datepick is jquery plugin, you need $(this) in front of it
[07:10:48] <roger_padactor> how would I get a dive that is something like <div class="bla" role="main">
[07:11:28] <systemfault> roger_padactor: Is "bla" on more than a single element?
[07:11:44] <AdamPDotty> role is not HTML, right?
[07:11:52] <systemfault> adajad: WAI-ARIA
[07:11:52] <roger_padactor> systemfault: yes… but role="main" isn't
[07:12:07] <systemfault> roger_padactor: Then $('.bla[role="main"]')
[07:12:13] <roger_padactor> thanks
[07:12:13] <AdamPDotty> div[role=main]
[07:12:38] <systemfault> oops, sorry adajad, I meant AdamPDotty
[07:12:42] <adajad> :)
[07:13:37] <systemfault> We should all be using WAI-ARIA in our code for acessibility… (I never do though…)
[07:18:30] <BillCriswell> I really don't feel like working today.
[07:18:37] <BillCriswell> This is weird.
[07:19:22] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/2SgSs/5/ you think this would be better done in canvas or svg?
[07:19:27] <systemfault> BillCriswell: I can't see what's weird with that :/ It happens to me at least once a month
[07:19:41] <nFFF> Using image maps, if the user clicks the jacket, adn we load a new jacket onto the map, it could ahve different co-ordinates
[07:21:24] <systemfault> nFFF: I did something similar for work.. I ended up using "targets" on the clothes that could be hovered to get info
[07:21:37] <systemfault> Using normal DOM, no canvas/svg
[07:28:14] <seutje> roger_padactor: are you a reference to that ace ventura character?
[07:28:29] <roger_padactor> yes
[07:28:41] <seutje> isn't that podactor?

[07:29:33] <systemfault> seutje: Whoa, I thought it would be longer

[07:36:28] <Quest> NodeX, whats #somediv and #the-div-you-want?
[07:36:35] <Nicocs> Hello
[07:36:37] <frankstallone> Anybody ever play with Apple maps.apple.com to get a web site to pop up to the native Apple Maps? Having an issue where, on an iOS6 device, the maps.apple.com url goes to Google Maps lol
[07:37:22] <NodeX> somediv is the div you're BINDING to and the-div-you-want is the DIV that the DATEPICKER will be run on
[07:37:36] <Nicocs> I'm trying to use this: http://jsfiddle.net/bgrins/ctkY3/ in here http://www.quoteroot.com/test/i.php but when i pick a color its hex value is not dislpayed
[07:37:36] <Quest> hm
[07:38:19] <Quest> NodeX,  i did that but that loads the calender in the-div-you-want on page load. (regardless of click)
[07:38:41] <NodeX> wtf
[07:38:58] <systemfault> lol
[07:39:01] <NodeX> [14:34:06] <NodeX> <div id="somediv"></div> ..... <script>$(document).ready(function(){$("#somediv").click(function(){datepick();});})</script>
[07:39:09] <NodeX> when did that ^^ get changed into that last shit?
[07:39:17] <tomasm-> hi, is there a way using jquery to make an android app, entirely (mostly) in Jquery? I have some raw json data from a server  I just need to present in charts, lists, graphs (line or bar or pie), etc.
[07:39:30] <NodeX> <div id="somediv"></div> ..... <script>$(document).ready(function(){$("#somediv").click(function(){$("#the-div-you-want").datepick();});})</script>
[07:39:37] <NodeX> use that
[07:39:46] <systemfault> tomasm-: How about a webpage? :(
[07:40:44] <Quest> NodeX, http://jsfiddle.net/q5x6d/3/
[07:40:47] <tomasm-> systemfault, I'm just concerned about seeing it clearly enough on my android phone, and having an easy link to it from my app menu....
[07:40:54] <tomasm-> and maybe auto-authentication if thats possible
[07:41:15] <tomasm-> webpages I've seen always were tiny, and i had to zoom in.
[07:41:33] <systemfault> tomasm-: Before they were not made for mobile
[07:41:47] <systemfault> tomasm-: You have control over the viewport if you want
[07:41:54] <Quest> NodeX,  oh. thanks. now your works too
[07:42:06] <systemfault> tomasm-: You can even disallow resizing.. stuff like that.
[07:42:35] <systemfault> tomasm-: http://developer.android.com/guide/webapps/targeting.html
[07:43:11] <tomasm-> systemfault, so you mean i'd open this tool through chrome instead of it's own app?
[07:43:59] <jonez> is there a way to use jqueryui.datepicker and allow it to select a year more than 10 years in the past? I tried setting minDate to "-20Y" and it did not accept it.
[07:44:16] <systemfault> tomasm-: That's what I had in mind… and of course, that means automatic support for iphone/windows phone 8/etc
[07:44:37] <systemfault> tomasm-: If you don't want that.. android probably has a webview that you can use.
[07:44:53] <systemfault> tomasm-: You'll need to write a bit of java though
[07:44:54] <Teduardo> I have a list of IP addresses in a table, each IP address has it's own <tr>, at the top of the page I have a search box when the user starts typing I would like it to only show rows that match the search input. Does anyone know of an example on the web that can help me with this?
[07:45:33] <tomasm-> systemfault, so webview embeds a webpage in an android app?
[07:46:04] <systemfault> tomasm-: I haven't personally used the android sdk webviews.. but all toolkits have something like that.
[07:46:13] <systemfault> http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html
[07:46:28] <kurund> hello all, I am trying to $.parseJSON(), it works fantastically in all browsers except IE8/9, any pointer how to fix this or any other workarounds.. thanks
[07:47:57] <tomasm-> systemfault, so you're saying i could theoretically make it for the web and have a very primitive layout (just a dropdown menu at the top for different sections) and use the viewport specs to size it properly?
[07:48:49] <systemfault> tomasm-: I wouldn't say "primitive" as you can have pretty advanced functionalities…. but touch-friendly.
[07:49:25] <tomasm-> yeah i just mean compact. does jquery have much functionality for multi-level menu systems?
[07:49:36] <tomasm-> on mobile devices
[07:49:58] <systemfault> Take a look at jquery mobile… but I haven't used it.
[07:50:07] <dcherman> kurund: what's not working - a ?demo would help as well
[07:50:31] <dcherman> bah, lazy bots not here - a demo at http://jsfiddle.net/
[07:50:36] <jonez> I got my answer... google'd it.
[07:52:48] <asker> hey guys, is it possible to select all elements not having a certain class?
[07:52:57] <tomasm-> oooh, i like jquery mobile.... maybe just what i needed.
[07:53:06] <asker> $('.listelement <not having>.sleect')
[07:53:10] <asker> something ike that
[07:53:20] <Brodingo> :not(.class)
[07:53:23] <dcherman> asker: $( ".listelement" ).not( ".select" )
[07:53:59] <tomasm-> systemfault, thanks
[07:54:37] <systemfault> $('.listelement:not(.select)') also
[07:56:24] <tomasm-> anyone know of a good jquery-based (probably html5 underneath) graphing library that would work ok on jquery mobile (an android phone)? last I used was a flash-based charting system
[07:56:36] <asker> hmm it doesnt work
[07:56:38] <jChristoph> I'm curious if anyone has any recommendations for a decent/good tag cloud plugin that is jQ 1.9 compliant/compatible?  The one I'm currently using is fairly old and I think the original author is just letting it die.
[07:56:51] <asker> its dom, how to make it "on"?
[07:57:26] <NoiseEee> jChristoph: ideally its on github or something and you fork it and do a favor for everyone if possible
[07:57:34] <NoiseEee> jChristoph: to be brutally honest
[07:57:52] <NoiseEee> thats how plugins will become 1.9 compat
[07:58:44] <asker> some has an ideA?
[07:59:21] <roger_padactor> if I wanted to get a some element with classes .thing .title.click   i would look for #('.thing .title .click')?
[07:59:32] <EdwardIII> hey, i'm trying to use masonry but even if a brick is display: none, it still gets it's height/position calculated which i don't want, i just want it to be invisible heh
[07:59:53] <kamoricks> roger_padactor: ".thing.title.click".
[07:59:54] <jChristoph> NoiseEee, appreciate the honesty.  If I couldn't find one (and so far, the search has been fruitless), I was going to just modify what we have (which isn't on git -- I might add it, though)
[08:00:05] <kamoricks> roger_padactor: In CSS, a space is the "any decendent" operator.
[08:01:29] <alias> hi
[08:01:34] <Androidnewbe198> Hi

[08:01:50] <Androidnewbe198> can you guys see what im typing ?
[08:01:57] <alias> no
[08:02:08] <Androidnewbe198> alias good
[08:02:50] <fuzai> How do I change a form text field from read only to not with query?
[08:03:01] <Androidnewbe198> I am trying to get row sibling from given row but I would like to get only the first set so row siblings
[08:03:03] <fuzai> jquery, sorry my auto correct keeps getting it
[08:03:27] <Androidnewbe198> so if i have <tr title="1"></tr><tr title="2"></tr><tr title="2"></tr><tr title="1"></tr><tr title="2"></tr>  given i have reference to the first row i would like to get the siblings with title="2" up to the secod tr with title="1"
[08:03:47] <roger_padactor> kamoricks: does that also work using jquery? so If i wanted to get all a tags that are inside <div class="thing"><p class="title"><a class="title"> .. $(div.thing p.title a.title) ??
[08:04:06] <kamoricks> roger_padactor: Yes.
[08:04:14] <roger_padactor> thanks
[08:05:32] <fuzai> <input id="simple" type="text" readonly="readonly"> how do i remove readonly?
[08:05:51] <ggherdov> hi all. How do I merge two objects in js? Can one do that? example: o1 = {'foo': 'bar'} ; o2 = {'apple': 'tomato'} , and I'd like to get o3 with {'foo': 'bar', 'apple': 'tomato'}
[08:06:09] <systemfault> fuzai: $('#simple').prop('readonly', false);
[08:06:15] <fuzai> ty system
[08:06:29] <systemfault> ggherdov: Look at $.extend
[08:06:58] <kamoricks> Also look at Object.create().
[08:07:24] <systemfault> ggherdov: var final = $.extend({}, o1, o2); IIRC
[08:07:38] <ggherdov> systemfault: ok thanks. $ is jquery specifi, right?
[08:07:42] <systemfault> yes
[08:07:45] <ggherdov> kamoricks: thanks
[08:08:03] <systemfault> Object.create is nicer but not supported on bad browsers
[08:08:22] <ggherdov> systemfault: I see
[08:11:03] <Androidnewbe198> so anyone knos if it's possible to do what i am trying to do?
[08:14:02] <Androidnewbe198> in short i am trying to get first set of row siblings matching the title condition
[08:14:22] <codepython7771> Is this valid code? jQuery(document).ready(function(){ jQuery("#slide-list").remove();  });
[08:14:53] <codepython7771> it works - or is there a better way to write it?
[08:14:53] <BillCriswell> codepython7771: Looks fine to me.
[08:15:13] <BillCriswell> $(function(){ $('#slide-list').remove(); });
[08:15:38] <BillCriswell> Androidnewbe198: You could do like... $('tr[title=foo]').siblings()
[08:15:47] <codepython7771> BillCriswell: how do i remove it after 10 seconds of load?
[08:16:09] <BillCriswell> codepython7771: Not so much better, just shorter.
[08:16:12] <niix> what's wrong with this? http://hastebin.com/pepitesuqu.js
[08:16:25] <BillCriswell> codepython7771: setTimeout().
[08:17:37] <yoloswag420> http://dpaste.org/naI69/ <- anyone see why I might be getting "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'tablesosrter'"?
[08:18:02] <codepython7771> BillCriswell: nice, thanks
[08:18:13] <Androidnewbe198> BillCriswell but that would get me all the syblings with given title right ? but I just want the first set. Becaus I migh have 3 next siblings with this titile then one with different title and again some siblings with the same title but I just want the first set.
[08:19:22] <BillCriswell> codepython7771: No problem.
[08:19:46] <BillCriswell> Androidnewbe198: Tough to follow.
[08:19:57] <roger_padactor> hmm Im trying to select an a tag that has class="title click" but my selector $('a.title.click') isn't getting it… $('a.title') works  $('a.click') doesn't either.
[08:20:23] <Xeon06_> Hey guys
[08:20:29] <Xeon06_> Can anyone explain to me why this works? http://jsfiddle.net/9TRCX/
[08:20:44] <BillCriswell> roger_padactor: Not sure why that wouldn't work.
[08:20:52] <Xeon06_> I'm using on("submit") on a div that contains a form. I figure it should only work on the form itself?
[08:21:08] <roger_padactor> hmmm there is an extra space between the two classes does that matter?
[08:21:12] <BillCriswell> Xeon06_: YEs.
[08:21:26] <Xeon06_> BillCriswell: but that's not what happens here http://jsfiddle.net/9TRCX/ it works regardless
[08:22:02] <BillCriswell> Xeon06_: Oh, I was wrong. Didn't expect that.
[08:22:19] <NoiseEee> Xeon06_: the event bubbles, right?
[08:22:22] <Androidnewbe198> BillCriswell ?
[08:22:37] <BillCriswell> Androidnewbe198: I'm just having trouble following what you're trying to do.
[08:24:35] <BillCriswell> roger_padactor: Don't think the space should matter.
[08:24:44] <roger_padactor> hmmm very odd
[08:26:39] <yoloswag420> http://dpaste.org/UPOet/ Does anyone see a reason why this would be giving me "...has no method 'tablesorter'"?
[08:26:46] <Androidnewbe198> BillCriswell I know i having trouble explaining it
[08:26:50] <Androidnewbe198> my self
[08:27:57] <BillCriswell> roger_padactor: http://jsfiddle.net/ZPkCr/ got it working here.
[08:28:59] <roger_padactor> hmmm
[08:29:22] <roger_padactor> I'm doing a chrome extension… might be why...
[08:29:22] <BillCriswell> Don't ask my why I named the class red and used the color black lol.
[08:29:58] <Xeon06_> NoiseEee: Never thought of event bubbling like that...
[08:31:09] <Brodingo> yoloswag420 first of all, awesome nick. you should get rid of duplicate IDs. and consider putting all your javascript before </body>
[08:31:30] <BillCriswell> lol
[08:31:49] <Brodingo> if its giving you that error it means $ is not getting extended with .tablesorter()
[08:33:19] <yoloswag420> Brodingo: I assume you're talking about the duplicate nav for the div and ul? Also, moving that snippet to <head> didn't make any changes.
[08:34:00] <Brodingo> yes and i meant moving them from head to right before the body end tag
[08:34:29] <Brodingo> also a live demo would be tite
[08:37:37] <FunnyLookinHat> Hey guys - trying to make my AJAX JSON responses more secure by prepending while(1); to them, but in so doing I realized I'll have to parse the JSON differently... is there a jQ extension that already does this?

That icon needs change when the image is refreshed (Should have access to which image is displayed).
[08:38:54] <yoloswag420> Brodingo: also with this, I'm not seeing any errors (not sure where to look I suppose with jsfiddle) but it's also still not sorting
[08:44:09] <Teduardo> Howdy, can someone take a quick look at this and maybe suggest a better way to do it? http://jsfiddle.net/TFBVn/

[08:44:57] <scriptraptor> Hi guys I'm using $.ajax - the path has a php error on it (no database selected) but because I'm using js i'm getting no PHP error msg. any idea how to fix this?
[08:45:22] <kurund> any alternatives to $.parseJSON ?
[08:46:33] <NoiseEee> scriptraptor: send back a fail response
[08:46:47] <scriptraptor> with .fail()?
[08:47:02] <NoiseEee> scriptraptor: well have your PHP page return a proper error message, ie: a bad header
[08:50:16] <scriptraptor> NoiseEee: tried a few things but still nada, could you elaborate on what you mean in case i misunderstood
[08:52:05] <NoiseEee> scriptraptor: first of all, your PHP script should be checking for errors/exceptions, and should be sending back an appropriate response (ie: 4xx header)
[08:54:33] <scriptraptor> NoiseEee: the problem is with the PHP missing a require() can't see anything here that relates to replace die() msg: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes
[08:55:38] <NoiseEee> scriptraptor: the answer is "proper error handler on the PHP site"
[08:55:42] <NoiseEee> s/site/side
[08:55:46] <NoiseEee> you never just die()
[08:55:58] <NoiseEee> you handle the error properly/gracefully
[08:56:10] <yoloswag420> http://jsfiddle.net/CQcRy hm, why isn't this table sort working?

[08:57:56] <BillCriswell> You have a </tbody> in the middle of a table.
[08:58:15] <yoloswag420> whaaa
[08:58:25] <codepython7771> I want to add "<a id="tray-button"><img id="tray-arrow" src="img/button-tray-up.png"/></a>" inside a <div id="controls"> and add CSS to tray-button. How can i do this on page load?
[08:58:31] <nFFF> systemfault, did you sue image maps?
[08:58:36] <nFFF> use**
[08:59:28] <scriptraptor> NoiseEee: this is first attempt at AJAX so i'm trying to do it all properly
[08:59:31] <yoloswag420> BillCriswell: It seems that after fixing that is't behaving the exact same, and throwing now erros
[08:59:34] <BillCriswell> yoloswag420: http://jsfiddle.net/CQcRy/2/ no errors there now.
[09:00:23] <systemfault> nFFF: Nope, only <a> with a "target" image
[09:00:40] <systemfault> nFFF: Used absolute positioning for positioning them
[09:00:44] <nOStahl> hi guys I'm trying to do a toggle with a div as a button but the div just auto hides when I refresh the page hehe
[09:01:24] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/2SgSs/5/ , the different parts of the outfit (jacket, trousers), are being loaded as seperate images, and area defined by a html map. The end goal is a user clicks the jacket, and can load a new jacket, but the new jacket will obviously be slightly different shape, so we would need a new html map for each jacket. Can SVG or Canvas intrinsically handle this, or would we still
[09:01:24] <nFFF> need to define areas for new shapes/items
[09:01:37] <yoloswag420> BillCriswell: the one you posted, it was sorting for you?
[09:01:41] <nFFF> systemfault, the issue is as above ^^, new items will be loaded, and the jacket shape might change
[09:01:51] <systemfault> Ah!
[09:02:09] <nFFF> with maps we can define the boundries of new item of clothing
[09:02:21] <BillCriswell> yoloswag420: No, but there wasn't errors. I just assumed there's more shit you need to set up.
[09:02:23] <nFFF> but was wondering if svg or canvas could intrinsically handle this
[09:03:04] <systemfault> nFFF: I guess that svg would be better than canvas for that
[09:03:32] <systemfault> nFFF: As you can have shapes that easily referencable since they're part of a DOM
[09:03:41] <systemfault> *that are easily.
[09:03:54] <red_trumpet_> Hi
[09:04:14] <systemfault> nFFF: Is browser support an issue? I mean, do you have to support IE8?
[09:04:27] <nFFF> not particularaly
[09:04:35] <nFFF> although ie,8 im unsure about
[09:04:39] <nFFF> 6/7 dont care
[09:04:45] <nFFF> have you heard fo kinetic.js?#
[09:04:52] <nFFF> http://kineticjs.com/
[09:05:56] <systemfault> nFFF: No, looks nice though
[09:06:32] <nFFF> http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/labs/html5-canvas-shape-tango-with-kineticjs/
[09:06:40] <nFFF> this is basically more functionality then what i need
[09:06:47] <nFFF> replace random objects with clothing items
[09:07:08] <nFFF> the questionsis how would you draw them so they line up eprfect, the clothing items that is
[09:07:10] <scriptraptor> NoiseEee: i'm using try/catch and php header but nothing happening still
[09:07:20] <nFFF> with .png's you can just use position absolute in css
[09:07:21] <scriptraptor> am i doing something wrong?
[09:08:18] <nOStahl> is there anything wrong with this code… http://pastebin.ca/2310943
[09:08:24] <nOStahl> its short
[09:08:44] <NoiseEee> scriptraptor: well actually missing a bad require() in a PHP script is a fatal error, uncatchable.  fix it!
[09:08:45] <systemfault> nFFF: Look at the kinetics documentation
[09:13:41] <mandarks> hey guys, how can i get a relative elements absolute positioning
[09:13:48] <mandarks> ??
[09:14:18] <EdwardIII> markatto: $('#elem').position() ?
[09:15:10] <mandarks> cheers
[09:16:42] <fuzai> http://pastie.org/6066322  <-- i'm getting $(…).prop not a function.  Could someone explain to me why when I click my button that .prop doesn't work?
[09:17:21] <scriptraptor> NoiseEee: how am i to know if there is a fatal error via ajax call when i'm not told there's a problem with the script? especially if ajax call is expecting a specific format (json) then i can't return anything but that
[09:17:46] <NoiseEee> scriptraptor: a require() failing in php is a special case, its a FATAL ERROR
[09:17:52] <systemfault> fuzai: You're using a 1960's version of jQuery?
[09:18:05] <NoiseEee> scriptraptor: a script like that would have to be fixed before ever being deployed in the real world
[09:18:08] <fuzai> i'm pretty sure its 1.9
[09:18:14] <fuzai> i'll look into it
[09:18:17] <scriptraptor> NoiseEee: i'm googling loads to see ways around this and only ob_start is coming up
[09:18:27] <systemfault> fuzai: If so, try using .removeAttr('readonly') instead
[09:18:33] <scriptraptor> NoiseEee: yes. but that's why the error reporting is there, to fix that
[09:18:35] <fuzai> ok ty
[09:18:37] <NoiseEee> scriptraptor: its an error that simply would not exist in real world reporting.
[09:18:42] <NoiseEee> s/reporting/production
[09:18:55] <scriptraptor> so how can i fix in production without an error being thrown
[09:19:05] <NoiseEee> scriptraptor: fix the require()  ##php
[09:19:18] <scriptraptor> that's the not the point i know to fix the require
[09:19:26] <scriptraptor> how am i supposed to know that's the problem?
[09:19:28] <fuzai>  * jQuery JavaScript Library v1.3.2 wow ok ty
[09:19:35] <scriptraptor> there's no error thrown with the ajax call
[09:19:36] * fuzai shakes head
[09:19:39] <systemfault> fuzai: That's prehistoric :P
[09:19:43] <NoiseEee> scriptraptor: looking in your error logs as a server admin.
[09:19:53] <NoiseEee> scriptraptor: require() is not a typical errors or application error at all
[09:20:05] <fuzai> boy i hope i don't upgrade this and it breaks everything else :p
[09:20:28] <NoiseEee> scriptraptor: something like  try { $user->update($stuff); } catch (Exception ($e) { //HERE WOULD GO XHR/AJAX RESPONSE OF BADNESS }
[09:20:57] <scriptraptor> tried that, with require in the try block
[09:21:03] <NoiseEee> scriptraptor: require() is just not a case where its even handle-able because there's a fundamental, uncatchable error.
[09:21:23] <scriptraptor> in which case you're suggesting error log only
[09:21:24] <NoiseEee> scriptraptor: please stop or continue this nonsense in ##php.  REQUIRE() IS A FATAL ERROR
[09:21:36] <NoiseEee> the script simply does not run / get processed
[09:21:59] <scriptraptor> with you
[09:26:06] <scriptraptor> NoiseEee: at risk of annoying you now, let's say it wasn't a fatal error, instead echo $var_doesnt_exist_yet or something, -- since i can't get error display in ajax file would you build your try/catch around it and only run if all is ok?
[09:27:16] <NoiseEee> scriptraptor: as a backend programmer, you need to handle errors properly.  perhaps that is just something like if(!isset($varShouldExist)) { //send error stuff back to XHR })
[09:27:20] <NoiseEee> scriptraptor: none of it is magic
[09:28:47] <EdwardIII> hrm i want to use 'html' in the jQuery UI modal title property, but any html i put in seems to get escaped heh
[09:29:13] <EdwardIII> seems like it's getting it's entites encoded which i don't want
[09:30:54] <scriptraptor> NoiseEee: it's not my errors. it's trying to upgrade the php version and implement new features, so catching errors is kinda important so i can debug
[09:31:11] <NoiseEee> scriptraptor: you do that on the backend.
[09:31:17] <scriptraptor> this code is like 13yo+
[09:31:29] <fuzai> Whooo hooo
[09:31:44] <fuzai> gosh i should have came and just asked that before i wasted an hour verifying my syntax
[09:31:48] <fuzai> thank you :)
[09:32:07] <scriptraptor> how do i send the error stuff back in your instance btw? as json [if it expects json] or as bad HTTP/4xx?
[09:32:29] <NoiseEee> scriptraptor: you dont bring your 13-year-old script up to date by using XHR on it and seeing what it returns.
[09:32:36] <Palanivel-js> Hi Hi ....Any one have idea about converting GMT 5.5 Date() into GMT 4.0 Date().....Please share your ideas if you know.......'i tried google but not able to find the exact result....
[09:32:38] <NoiseEee> scriptraptor: im sorry, maybe someone else can help you further.
[09:35:49] <scriptraptor> NoiseEee: so what i gather from you is error reporting and XHR don't go together well, and apart from gracefully handling what i can i need to check the error log? (i'll leave you alone now)
[09:36:40] <NoiseEee> scriptraptor: "error reporting" means so many different things.  is there a fatal error on the backend?  is there a logic error in your app?  is there a server problem?
[09:36:58] <NoiseEee> all are examples of "error reporting"; you need to handle them separately/gracefully/applicably
[09:37:38] <NoiseEee> is the server down, or are you trying to access restricted info, or delete a user that can't be deleted, for example
[09:38:18] <thisboy> Anybody know the steps I gotta take to get this jQuery + Isotope thing working on mobile? http://home.no/dwaynie/test/
[09:38:31] <thisboy> Showing up blank :/
[09:39:39] <scriptraptor> NoiseEee: delete user example is a great example. you could handle that as json or HTTP, but it makes more sense to send unique json if that is what the XHR is expecting?
[09:39:51] <Teduardo> is it normal for prototype to break jquery on the same page?
[09:43:12] <nOStahl> hey guys I'm having trouble with this bit of code http://pastebin.ca/2310943  can anyone identify if its correct or not
[09:43:35] <NoiseEee> scriptraptor: I tend to treat the "delete user" example as a succesful HTTP response, ie: still a 200 response... I tend to put logic errors in something like  $response['status'] = "fail"; $response['error'] = "Cannot delete that user because X" and check for that on the JS side.  the backend creates the erros message/reason etc
[09:45:23] <scriptraptor> so since $response is an array would you do something like json_encode to pass back to the XHR (expecting json), or would $response be available on the original script now?
[09:45:41] <Teduardo> is there a better table sorting plugin than Tablekit that doesn't require prototype that anyone is aware of?
[09:45:58] <Kambfhase> nOStahl: well, it lints. I guess the .html("<") might be a problem though
[09:46:07] <NoiseEee> scriptraptor: i'd do something like: header('Content-type: application/json'); echo json_encode($output);   but again thats more for ##php
[09:46:13] <nOStahl> it lints?
[09:46:13] <Kambfhase> try &lt;
[09:46:19] <Kambfhase> http://www.jslint.com/
[09:46:50] <scriptraptor> NoiseEee: thanks, i think you've covered it
[09:47:05] <NoiseEee> scriptraptor: okay good!
[09:47:51] <kurund> I am getting invalid character error using $.parseJSON on IE 8/9, any help please..
[09:48:03] <naeluh> heeeyyy eeevveerryybbooddyy!!!
[09:48:09] <Kambfhase> kurund: jsonlint.com
[09:48:33] <Mottie> Tedurado: you can use jQuery and prototype on the same page, just make sure jQuery has noConflict() mode set.
[09:48:43] <Kambfhase> ?a @ naeluh
[09:49:03] <naeluh> Kambfhase: just saying hello
[09:49:15] <Kambfhase> WELL; HELLO THEN
[09:49:18] <Mottie> Tedurado: There is tablesorter and dataTables, and a multitude of other sorters that don't require a javascript library
[09:49:50] <kurund> Kambfhase: thanks checking ..
[09:50:00] <nOStahl> Kambfhase: what its doing is making my div #hide_sidebar   auto hide upon refreshing the screen
[09:50:15] <Teduardo> Mottie: I did var $j = jQuery.noConflict and then i replaced all $ with $j and it is freaking the hell out on me =)
[09:51:03] <Mottie> Tedurado: LOL, it might be easier to just do this in the document ready function: $j(function($){ /* code goes here using $ only }):
[09:51:05] <nOStahl> I'm trying to rip some code out of another place that has this working and applying it to my own
[09:51:20] <nOStahl> a div that has background image and id of hide_sidebar
[09:51:22] <Teduardo> nevermind I didn't do it properly
[09:51:29] <Teduardo> now that i replaced all of the $ with $j it works.
[09:51:38] <nOStahl> when clicked it hides the #sidebar div and expands the main div next to it
[09:51:39] <Mottie> YAY!
[09:51:43] <Teduardo> still dont really want to load prototype; i wonder why she did that
[09:52:10] <Teduardo> seems like there must be a better table sorter
[09:52:23] <Mottie> Teduardo: like I said there are a lot of sorters out there
[09:52:53] <Teduardo> tablekit i guess did everything completely automatically which is probably why she used it
[09:54:05] <kurund> Kambfhase: my json object is something like {'content': "large html..."}, on the server side json_encode method is used
[09:54:53] <kurund> Kambfhase: IE does not allow be to copy entire html in http://jsonlint.com/
[09:55:09] <Kambfhase> please paste your JSON
[10:07:54] <inv3nt0r> Hi everyone. I'm having problems with IE7/IE8 (go figure) and the  $(window).resize()  handler...
[10:08:07] <inv3nt0r> The short of it is that it doesn't do anything :) Any thoughts?
[10:11:22] <naeluh> Kambfhase: HEY THANKS -  hey i have this fiddle and I want it to run smother like this page does it, not sure why I am getting so much gitter on my scale - here is the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/cAd4D/1/ and here is the page that I am trying to get to http://unfold.no/#/people how the it looks when you hover over the people
[10:12:02] <SillyTalker> is there a good way to refresh part of a website (a <script>) ?
[10:12:51] <Kambfhase> SillyTalker: I dont think you can "refresh" a script
[10:13:24] <SillyTalker> Kambfhase: are you sure of it?
[10:13:44] <Kambfhase> I mean, once the code has run you cant 'unrun' it
[10:14:02] <SillyTalker> so what happens when you reload a webpage?
[10:14:25] <SillyTalker> this script i talk about is javascript that just outputs some html content
[10:14:29] <SillyTalker> a few divs
[10:15:22] <SillyTalker> the reason i want to do this is because i use this: http://www.fasw.ws/faswwp/non-jquery-page-transitions-lightweight/
[10:15:23] <Kambfhase> naeluh: you might want to update your jQ version
[10:15:40] <SillyTalker> and since i use it the chat applet i have on my site doesnt load anymore until i refresh the entire page
[10:15:45] <SillyTalker> so i figured maybe there was a better solution
[10:15:47] <naeluh> Kambfhase: ok yeah I didnt think of that
[10:15:52] <SillyTalker> else i will jsut get rid of the transitions
[10:15:55] <Kambfhase> naeluh: by "smoother" you mean slower?
[10:17:17] <naeluh> Kambfhase: I feel like the h1 shakes as it scales are you getting that ?
[10:18:44] <Kambfhase> It appears quite smooth to me, but its buggy
[10:19:33] <naeluh> Kambfhase: it just seems like on the http://unfold.no/#/people the text is so stable ? ok yeah which bugs? thanks
[10:20:14] <Kambfhase> hover over a face, ctrl+tab to leave the tab, move the mouse, go back.
[10:21:22] <naeluh> ok
[10:21:28] <naeluh> I did that
[10:21:46] <naeluh> it was still scalled
[10:21:49] <naeluh> scaled
[10:22:02] <Kambfhase> yeah, you can scale up all faces :D
[10:22:39] <Kambfhase> You could turn this into an easteregg, if someone scales up all faces, some message is displayed
[10:23:40] <naeluh> Kambfhase:  haha yeah your right about that
[10:25:04] <fission6> anyone have a rec for input widgets?
[10:25:16] <Kambfhase> What plugins do the cool kids use nowadays for templating?
[10:25:25] <systemfault> handlebars
[10:25:26] <`WarpKat> on jquery-ui 1.8.10, tabs worked great, and with the newer 1.10 or even 1.9 and the supporting jquery (the latest stable), there's a small gap between the tab and the encompassing UL...so it doesn't look seemless.  someone else posted a screenshot of what i'm explaining.  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11658776/jquery-ui-tabs-styling-removing-a-small-space-gap-between-tabs-and-content-and-r
[10:25:44] <`WarpKat> i'm wondering if there's a way to get rid of that gap - the old versions of the ui didn't do this
[10:27:06] <naeluh> Kambfhase:  is there a way I could more stability on the text or would that just be css?
[10:27:22] <naeluh> or will fixxing my bugs help ?
[10:27:29] <Kambfhase> dunno
[10:28:03] <naeluh> Kambfhase:  ok well thanks
[10:29:31] <Kambfhase> systemfault: thanks. I'mm gonna dive into that
[10:30:35] <systemfault> Kambfhase: If you want something super simple… take a look at the underscore templates
[10:36:41] <Kambfhase> I'm not a big fan of underscore
[10:41:51] <fission6> why not?
[10:41:58] <fission6> you can try lo dash
[10:42:07] <fission6> anyone have an input widget lib rec
[10:44:09] <vinmassaro> i'm trying to check if images on my page have a title attribute, then want to use use .each() to do something to each image, with no luck
[10:44:27] <codepython7771> how do i read EXIF from jpeg in jquery?
[10:44:38] <jrajav> My expert opinion is that you're doing something wrong vinmassaro
[10:44:54] <Kambfhase> Well, I dont see, why i should use a utility lib anyways. It makes the code hard to read
[10:45:16] <Kambfhase> codelahoma: good luck with that. I dont think, there is a plugin for that.
[10:45:16] <jrajav> Um.. because it makes it.. easier to read?
[10:47:17] <inv3nt0r> Anyone have any thoughts on why the $(window).resize(function) handler doesn't fire in IE7?
[10:47:20] <jrajav> The equivalent vanilla Javascript for stuff like _.where, _.uniq, _.clone, etc. is a lot of needless boilerplate that's easy to screw up, and it isn't obvious what some loop that checks conditions is doing versus a simply named method
[10:47:50] <jrajav> Underscore is very useful for that and I wish more people would use it effectively (or at least modularize their own code sanely)
[10:48:15] <thang> vinmassaro: you could use a selector like: $('img[title]')
[10:48:33] <vinmassaro> jrajav: i'm finding that if i do an if check for the title attribute, I'm unable to use $(this) to reference the matched images since that is returning the title attribute
[10:49:11] <jrajav> An if check for the title attribute?
[10:49:21] <jrajav> As thang just mentioned you can match attributes with selectors
[10:49:29] <Kambfhase> I am not arguing against its functionality. I am rather arguing against its functional core.
[10:49:35] <Kambfhase> _.filter(_.map(someName,function(e){return e.value+"foo";}),Boolean) << whats wrong here?
[10:50:18] <jrajav> Turns out you can write bad functional code just like you can write bad imperative code
[10:50:21] <jrajav> How about that, huh?
[10:50:47] <Kambfhase> Yeah, JavaScript, where is the |> Operator?
[10:51:03] <Kambfhase> That would be useful
[10:51:05] <bil`> I'm having some trouble with .delay() not actually delaying. Here's the chain             $('div.sys-alert').removeClass('active').delay(1000).remove();
[10:51:25] <Brodingo> bil` delay is for animation queue
[10:51:29] <Brodingo> try setTimeout
[10:51:31] <bil`> ah
[10:51:32] <bil`> k
[10:51:46] <Kambfhase> I think someName.map(...).filter(...) is much more readable
[10:51:58] <systemfault> It's more difficult to write bad functional code I think
[10:52:00] <kamoricks> It is, but it also has poorer browser support.
[10:52:36] <systemfault> Because the enforced referencial transparency makes the refactoring easier :D
[10:53:04] <Kambfhase> A browser that does have [].map can go fuck itself
[10:53:10] <jrajav> Also, Javascript wasn't really built for functional code. It seems like it on the surface with its great first-class function support, but as soon as you go any deeper than one or two filters you quickly run into issues with variadic arguments
[10:53:18] <jrajav> And 'this' but that gives you trouble no matter what
[10:53:22] <vinmassaro> jrajav: how can i use $(this) on line 3 to target the matched images? https://gist.github.com/vinmassaro/51ba83a37d4f1c96581b
[10:53:57] <jrajav> vinmassaro: Did you see what we said?
[10:54:06] <jrajav> vinmassaro: You should be matching the title attribute with an attribute selector
[10:54:50] <thaifood> How can I get line 24 of this code to return the ID when I click on it please?  I'm using $('#accordion').click(function() {   for the entire accordion to capture the click but need to return the actual div I clicked.  In this example I should get "rpt_dvc" returned.  http://fpaste.org/4JGo/
[10:55:38] <Kambfhase> thaifood: event.target.id
[10:55:57] <thaifood> literally ?
[10:56:14] <thaifood> currently i was trying  $('#accordion').click(function() { alert(this.id); });
[10:56:20] <Kambfhase> with event being the first argument of the event handler
[10:56:30] <thaifood> no sure what you mean
[10:56:40] <niix> What is a better way to call my methods? http://hastebin.com/nokulacake.js
[10:56:45] <thaifood> so instead of my alert....?
[10:56:47] <Kambfhase> $('#accordion').click(function(event) { alert(event.target.id); });
[10:56:51] <thaifood> ahhh
[10:56:55] <thaifood> thx, i'll give it a go
[10:57:43] <Kambfhase> niix: you shall not define variables in an if-block! CROCKS LAW #5
[10:58:05] <kamoricks> But what if we want the variable to be scoped to the if-block?
[10:58:17] <jrajav> Variables don't scope to blocks in Javascript
[10:58:22] <jrajav> Even if you want it REALLY bad
[10:58:29] <jrajav> Variables have function scope
[10:58:30] <niix> right, function based scoping
[10:58:42] <Kambfhase> niix: You shall use Semicolons. CROCKS LAW #3
[10:58:44] <thaifood> looks great,  thanks !
[10:58:49] <vinmassaro> jrajav: sorry, my jquery-fu is weak. Using img[title] and then $(this) with .each still doesn't work to hit those original img elements
[10:58:55] <jrajav> And all variable declarations act as if they were hoisted to the top of the first level of function they appear in
[10:58:55] <niix> Kambfhase: sorry man, I'm not using the semi-colons
[10:59:11] <niix> But can you assist me in another way to call my methods?

[11:02:52] <ryannielson> Does anyone know of any plugins that add the swipe from left and right panes like in facebook? Looking for something that allows peeking by pulling out and holding, stuff like that.
[11:03:04] <amaroks> Hello, I have a string that is HTML, How do I extract content of#myspan <span id="myspan">value</span> ?
[11:04:39] <naeluh> ryannielson: something like this http://iosscripts.com/iosslider/
[11:04:40] <BillCriswell> amaroks: $(stringOfHTML).find('#myspan')
[11:05:16] <ryannielson> naeluh: I meant more like a hidden pane that slides out from the left or right on edge swipes.
[11:05:30] <fission6> how do i get the value of a radio input field?
[11:05:31] <BillCriswell> .text();, sorry.
[11:05:42] <BillCriswell> $(stringOfHTML).find('#myspan').text() amaroks
[11:05:57] <amaroks> BillCriswell: Thank you
[11:05:59] <naeluh> ryannielson: on mobile or desktop?
[11:06:01] <amaroks> Life saver
[11:06:18] <ryannielson> naeluh: Mobile, for a responsive site
[11:06:52] <BillCriswell> amaroks: No problem.
[11:07:07] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/efamex/1/edit what I used to make sure it works.
[11:07:08] <Kambfhase> niix: Wenn du willst, kann ich eine andere Grammatik verwenden welche ich wohl besser beherrsche. Aber dann könnte es an der Verständigung hapern. Dennoch nett von dir, dass du mich auf meine Fehler hinweist.
[11:07:19] <naeluh> ryannielson: are you talking about a menu ?
[11:07:44] <niix> Kambfhase: heh thanks
[11:08:23] <naeluh> ryannielson:  I bet this can do what you need with some additions http://foundation.zurb.com/off-canvas.php
[11:08:35] <ryannielson> naeluh: Yes, menu or any other kind of hidden content really. Mainly menu
[11:09:06] <naeluh> ryannielson:  try that off canvas i think it could do it http://www.zurb.com/playground/off-canvas-layouts
[11:10:16] <ryannielson> naeluh: Hmm, I have something similar working. Just the swipe left/right isn't pretty binary. It'll be cool to be able to drag it part of the way and have it snap open or closed depending on how far the drag was.
[11:11:45] <kryl> hi, how to replace input submit button with an image with jqm ?

[11:17:31] <fschuindt> Kambfhase: hum, thank you, I will try this
[11:28:42] <ryannielson> naeluh: Hmm, not much better than my solution. Perhaps I'll just settle with the more binary swiping to open/close menus. Thanks for your help though

[11:37:19] <frankstallone> Question: iOS6 w/ jQuery Mobile: How do I include an external website but keep the header/footer chrome for the app I am building? rel="external" goes full screen and has no more back button.
[11:46:17] <NickNack> does anyone know why, my function only loads when the page is refreshed, it doesnt load the 1st time on the page? http://pastebin.com/sXcp85vR
[11:47:29] <Brodingo> NickNack probably has to do with the image being loaded
[11:47:53] <Brodingo> instead of doc ready try $(window).load(fn)
[11:49:19] <NickNack> hmm no, that didnt work =/
[11:49:28] <rideh> issue with globalEval(), my code doesnt seem to get triggered off events on page. Anyone mind taking a look? http://m.runyonsurfaceprep.com/calculators
[11:49:38] <NickNack> im wondering if the image is still loading when the person clicks on the button
[11:50:08] <NickNack> could that be a possible problem?
[11:50:20] <Brodingo> well something you need to be cautious of is making calculations on things that need to download
[11:50:31] <Brodingo> you're setting the src and immediately trying to get the width of it
[11:50:54] <NickNack> well not immediately, but it should load fairly quickly
[11:51:05] <Brodingo> no, in the code its immediate
[11:51:06] <NickNack> im almost thinking i might have to redo it in ajax
[11:51:25] <Brodingo> at least something that takes into account when the image is done
[11:51:50] <NickNack> what do you suggest i should try?
[11:51:54] <Brodingo> you can use .load() on an $('<img>')
[11:51:58] <systemfault> Right...
[11:52:06] <systemfault> Set a load handler THEN set the src
[11:52:23] <systemfault> The width/height will be available inside the load handler
[11:53:19] <ravenzz> you should always do that
[11:53:43] <NickNack> hmm ok, let me see what i can do then
[11:54:26] <ravenzz> and maybe consider to handle failures
[11:57:00] <jackjackw> theory question: how would you achieve something like pinterests photowall using jquery?

[11:57:31] <NickNack> ^^
[11:57:31] <tw2113> for the actual display
[11:57:59] <tw2113> how you load the images is kind of preference
[12:00:05] <jackjackw> thanks guys, saved me a bit of googling :)

[12:07:29] <mowol> your favorite carousel plugin? :) I need to show several divs beside eachother and then slide to the sides. I use serialScroll atm, but its cycle parameters goes all the way to the left instead of sliding to the left block by block
[12:08:02] <Brodingo> jcarousel is ok
[12:08:38] <jsemko> i like cycle for lighter carousels, caroufredsel for more config options
[12:09:19] <Brodingo> cycle is a slideshow, not carousel
[12:09:32] <maxmoore14> I'm trying to extend the jqm dialog widget - here is my progress - http://jsfiddle.net/dZYmJ/5/
[12:09:52] <maxmoore14> goal is to created a method to easily show chained dialogs
[12:10:20] <maxmoore14> and add them to the DOM programattically
[12:10:37] <mowol> Brodingo you are right, but it was the only plugin i had some experience with :) But ill try jcarousel. thanks
[12:10:58] <Brodingo> good luck
[12:11:10] <maxmoore14> nearly working, but when the top most dialog closes, it doesn't open the previous one, it goes all the back to the original loading page
[12:11:24] <maxmoore14> problem is in the state hash I think - really not sure
[12:13:00] <maxmoore14> FYI - I'm using jqm 1.3 rc1
[12:14:50] <maxmoore14> I'm also open to alternative methods of chaining dialogs if someone has a better idea
[12:15:42] <Engin> is there a reason why jq still does not include cookie support ?
[12:16:07] <Engin> there's a convenient jq plugin for it. what is a good way to manage cookies ?
[12:16:37] <ajpiano> because there's a plugin for it
[12:16:43] <ajpiano> that's why it isn't in jquery core
[12:17:31] <Engin> i happen to need in every project, so it might be very well in the core, well. so the plugin is the preferred way, alright.
[12:18:33] <ajpiano> yep
[12:18:49] <ajpiano> there are a lot of things that "i always use" that don't apply to everybody
[12:18:53] <ajpiano> thus they don't go in core
[12:22:14] <Engin> hahaha see the github repo of the cookie plugin ? 2845 stars, 978 FORKS for 92 sloc :)
[12:22:33] <systemfault> Lines of code is a bad metric.
[12:23:00] <tw2113> i don't need cookie support in jQuery, why should i have to download the code for it
[12:23:47] <Zzaichik> cookies!! om nom nom nom

[12:25:11] <maxmoore14> anyone able to help me work on a jqm dialog widget - http://jsfiddle.net/dZYmJ/5/
[12:31:24] <sunbeam> http://pastebin.com/c74srFBV
[12:31:28] <sunbeam> whats wrong with this code?
[12:31:48] <sunbeam> i need for each input checkbox in each .one-checkbox-select check if either yes or no is selected
[12:31:52] <sunbeam> and not both
[12:32:10] <Kambfhase> you can just .change() and bind to all. no need for .each()
[12:32:29] <bil`> whats the default timeout length for .ajax()
[12:32:31] <sunbeam> Kambfhase: can you tell me how my code should like like in that case?
[12:32:53] <maxmoore14> sunbeam: use prop() for checkbox state, not attr()
[12:33:17] <maxmoore14> sunbeam: http://jqapi.com/#p=prop
[12:33:26] <Kambfhase> http://pastebin.com/B8kJzUtt
[12:33:54] <systemfault> Kambfhase++
[12:34:10] <maxmoore14> regarding chained dialogs, this is my goal: http://jsfiddle.net/6TYyX/
[12:34:14] * Kambfhase leveled up.
[12:34:37] <maxmoore14> I'm open to any method of accomplishing it - my best effort so far is this - http://jsfiddle.net/dZYmJ/5/
[12:34:58] <maxmoore14> but I need help please - any jqm widget experts avail?
[12:35:00] <Kambfhase> sunbeam: btw, why not go for radiobuttons?
[12:35:07] <sunbeam> Kambfhase: i know, thanks
[12:35:11] <sunbeam> ehm wish of my client :(
[12:35:23] <Kambfhase> okay :S
[12:35:51] <sunbeam> Kambfhase: the problem is, why this code is not ok
[12:36:02] <sunbeam> is because i have many .one-checkbox-select with input fields
[12:36:09] <sunbeam> so i can only select one yes or no
[12:36:16] <sunbeam> while i should be able to select 6 yes or no's
[12:36:31] <Kambfhase> a) you have a syntax error, b) there is no need for .each()
[12:38:18] <Kambfhase> maxmoore14: WTF, your code gives me a syntax error in jquery-1.9.0.js Line 3811 :o
[12:43:02] <maxmoore14> Kambfhase: yeah, I think I'm passing an invalid function reference maybe
[12:43:06] <maxmoore14> not quite sure
[12:43:22] <maxmoore14> I can strip out a bunch of the code if you like
[12:43:30] <maxmoore14> but do you see what I'm trying to do?
[12:45:06] <Kambfhase> delete the ); on the very last line
[12:45:51] <Deas> ya, delete the sad face, why would we ever want to have one? :O
[12:46:52] <Kambfhase> onclick="starttest()" ? Why do people still use this ancient technique?
[12:47:19] <Mottie> because it still works
[12:47:56] <maxmoore14> http://jsfiddle.net/dZYmJ/9/
[12:48:18] <Deas> what Mottie said and because it's easiest
[12:48:21] <systemfault> Kambfhase: Because most programmers are copy/pasters..
[12:48:23] <maxmoore14> I was just being lazy when putting together the sample
[12:48:32] <systemfault> Kambfhase: They copy/paste crap codes from t3h interw3bs
[12:48:54] <Kambfhase> mor like: They copy/paste crap codes from w3schools
[12:48:59] <systemfault> They don't take time to analyze it.. to understand it in order to become more proficient programmers.
[12:49:01] <thisboy> anybody know why this crashes my mobile applewebkit browser? $("#link").click(function(){ $("#container").slideToggle(); });
[12:49:17] <systemfault> thisboy: Looks harmless
[12:49:30] <thisboy> systemfault: hmm
[12:49:41] <thisboy> systemfault: maybe i should replace slideToggle with slideDown or maybe just show?
[12:49:47] <thisboy> this is jquery and not jquery mobile though
[12:49:55] <systemfault> TIAS :/ There's no way for us to know
[12:49:56] <Deas> systemfault & Kambfhase; since you two seem to know oh so much about this, do tell how you think the world should use instead of 'onclick=' :)
[12:50:09] <systemfault> Deas: In jquery, you'd use .on
[12:50:20] <Engin> any idea why today's trend is towards web content is in the middle rather than utulizing our wide screens ? (like twitter)
[12:50:21] <systemfault> Deas: They're event listeners
[12:50:33] <Deas> systemfault: and if your not using jquery? (:
[12:50:46] <tw2113> Engin, because the mobile revolution happened
[12:50:51] <systemfault> Deas: addEventListener and a shim for IE<9
[12:50:53] <tw2113> we were going huge, but then we went tiny
[12:50:56] <Kambfhase> The _only_ legit reason to use onclick is when you develop for Netscape 3
[12:51:37] <sonotos> Kambfhase: maybe some of them did...
[12:52:22] <tw2113> got it, be skeptical of any new tutorials using onclick=""
[12:53:22] <Engin> tw2113: thing you design for desktop NEVER works well for mobile.
[12:53:33] <Engin> you'll end up with a mobile version anyway.
[12:53:49] <systemfault> That's why you should start the opposite way..
[12:53:57] <systemfault> Mobile to desktop :P
[12:54:01] <Engin> :)
[12:54:06] <tw2113> at least that's why they argue to work from small to big
[12:54:23] <Engin> seriously though, the trend for the last decade is wider aspect rations yet web design trend insists on narrow designs
[12:54:38] <Engin> FB gave up and widened up
[12:54:41] <Kambfhase> ok, I am off.
[12:55:05] <tw2113> i still keep my browser window at 1024px wide
[12:55:09] <Engin> twitters bootstrap encourages narrow design too, and people seem to LOVE bootstrap
[12:55:34] <Engin> BTW, I'm not talking about anything wider than that, but if there's a wider screen just fluidly use it.
[12:55:59] <Engin> obviously if your site _requires_ anything more than 1024, it's no good either.
[12:56:19] <tw2113> depends on project need
[12:56:33] <tw2113> businesses/companies seem to want to target absolutely everyone
[12:56:36] <tw2113> so you have a limit
[12:56:48] <tw2113> and still end up going down to IE7 or so
[12:56:55] <nightstriker> Hello
[12:57:10] <tw2113> and 10 year old monitors that are neither flat, nor wider than 1024x768
[12:57:51] <b-ot> tw2113: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It's not just you! http://to IE7 or so is down! (ETIMEDOUT)
[12:58:02] <tw2113> lols
[12:58:07] <tw2113> silly b-ot
[12:58:17] <systemfault> Engin: I don't see it that way...
[12:58:36] <systemfault> Engin: Greater than 1024px width websites make sense...
[12:58:55] <systemfault> I really like the idea of responsive web design
[12:59:06] <Gho5t> Someone created a function to create a styled input and added it to jquery's prototype. When I call it on 2 textboxes, all of the events only work on the last textbox because the function's context is set to that one. Do I need to make a copy of the function or something?
[12:59:55] <nightstriker> I m havimg an issue i was hopimg to get some help i hava a js string thats in svgbase64 and im trying to post it back to csharp. Im using asp.net with an aspx page.
[13:00:18] <Mottie> nightstriker: any of that related to jQuery o.O
[13:00:33] <systemfault> Gho5t: Go see that someone and tell him to fix his code?
[13:00:36] <maxmoore14> ok, here is a really pared down version (no lazy onclick, I swear!) - http://jsfiddle.net/dZYmJ/13/

[13:08:10] <nightstriker> Wrong window
[13:21:08] <maxmoore14> ok - this runs for sure - you can definitely see the problem here - http://jsfiddle.net/dZYmJ/14/
[13:21:22] <maxmoore14> the first click opens a dialog
[13:21:42] <maxmoore14> then click on OK in the dialog to open a 2nd dialog successfully
[13:22:05] <maxmoore14> then click on OK to close the 2nd dialog and it goes back to the main page
[13:22:35] <maxmoore14> trying to figure out how to have it step back through the hierarchy
[13:23:24] <maxmoore14> from the jqm docs, it sounds like this behavior should already be built into the dialog widget, but I can't get it to work
[13:24:16] <maxmoore14> should I not be using data-rel: "back" on the close button?
[13:24:52] <maxmoore14> should I use $(element).dialog('close') instead? or $.mobile.back()?
[13:33:44] <maxmoore14> anybody free? I really need some help with this
[13:34:11] <maxmoore14> I can't be the only person who needs to chain dialogs, right?
[13:34:20] <fission6> are there any tools jquery has to use url query params to prepopulate a form?
[13:37:04] <maxmoore14> fission6: I wrote this method which I use http://jsfiddle.net/bTDxk/
[13:37:36] <fission6> maxmoore14: thanks, i want to repopulate some form fields based now what a user filled out from the referring page
[13:37:53] <maxmoore14> you could take the set of params and search for matching form element ids or names
[13:38:01] <fission6> yep
[13:38:10] <fission6> there are only 3 so i may just be explicit with the mapping
[13:38:12] <fission6> not to pain full
[13:40:44] <maxmoore14> fission6: if you convert the set to an array of name/value pairs, you could quickly loop through them all
[13:40:57] <fission6> well, its a bit tricky
[13:41:09] <fission6> i need to set the value on a radio select
[13:41:32] <maxmoore14> yeah, different input types will be a headache
[13:41:36] <fission6> so i think i need to query for input[name="whatever"] and then check it
[13:41:54] <fission6> .attr('checked', true);
[13:42:13] <lanken> I have a collection of elements which can be reached by a selector. I want to the value in a certain attribute -- each has a different value for this attribute
[13:42:48] <lanken> I was thinking it might be something like $(".blah").attr("data-j", $this.attr("data-j")) , but it's not working
[13:43:13] <lanken> I've been trying variations on "$this" with no luck
[13:45:01] <Brodingo> lanken that was kind of hard to follow
[13:45:19] <Skrewtape> Hi!  This code:  http://jsfiddle.net/Skrewtape/kM4Ug/  Works just fine in chrome, but in safari it looks pretty crappy; when the pane closes downward, it leaves all kind of ugly lines all over.  Any ideas how to resolve that issue in Safari?
[13:45:24] <lanken> Brodingo: I'm trying to increment the value in an attribute
[13:45:47] <lanken> Brodingo: so like .attr("data-j", "data-j"++)
[13:46:09] <Skrewtape> Works fine in Firefox too
[13:46:16] <Brodingo> does it have to be in the dom? why not just have that in your script?
[13:47:14] <lanken> Brodingo: there are some other functions which depend on these "data" values. The elements that carry them are table cells, and the data value is the cell's coordinates in the table.
[13:47:57] <lanken> Brodingo: if there's a better way of adding metadata to a dom element (so that it can be picked up when that dom element is referenced later) I'd be glad to switch.
[13:48:44] <jrockjiggz> data is great for that
[13:49:51] <djQuery> anyone figured out how to get the footer to appear at the bottom of the screen in jquery mobile?
[13:50:09] <djQuery> instead of scrolling off http://jsbin.com/tipper/8/edit
[13:50:24] <maxmoore14> lanken: something like this should work...
[13:50:25] <maxmoore14> $('.blah').attr('data-j', function(i, val) { return parseInt(val)++; });
[13:50:44] <lanken> maxmoore14: thanks! I was just starting to reach the "function" part of the .attr api page
[13:50:54] <JesperA> djQuery why use jquery for that, thats easy in html + css
[13:50:55] <lanken> maxmoore14: this is definitely the way to go :)
[13:51:13] <djQuery> JesperA, cause I suck at css lol
[13:51:41] <maxmoore14> djQuery: fixed footer
[13:52:20] <djQuery> need the first <div data-role="content"> to scroll and the footer to stay at the bottom of the page
[13:52:27] <maxmoore14> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/#/demos/1.2.0/docs/toolbars/bars-fixed.html
[13:55:55] <lanken> maxmoore14: fyi, the ++ doesn't work in "return" statements. switched to +1 and it's good.
[13:56:26] <maxmoore14> cool, glad you got it working
[13:56:37] <NoiseEee> lanken: because its been incremented afterwards.  you could alternatively switch it to ++var
[13:57:52] <djQuery> lanken, oh and instead of using attr("data-j") you might look into using .data("j")
[14:00:14] <lanken> djQuery: thanks, I'll look into it more at some point. It would be nice to have them not stored as Strings, and I bet it would improve performance too.
[14:03:02] <djQuery> maxmoore14, still scrolling off the page http://jsbin.com/tipper/10/edit
[14:04:34] <maxmoore14> djQuery: too much code, cut it down the piece you are testing
[14:04:34] <b-ot> maxmoore14: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It's not just you! http://the piece you are testing is down! (ENOTFOUND)
[14:05:00] <djQuery> maxmoore14, think its data-position="fixed"
[14:09:21] <djQuery> maxmahem, that did it
[14:11:26] <maxmahem> djQuery: glad to here it.
[14:11:31] <maxmahem> er hear it.
[14:17:55] <maxmoore14> based on the new 1.9 widget inheritance features, if I enable event handlers with _on, will _off be called automatically from _destroy?
[14:30:09] <neataroni> how do i give an input type text the current date (or something else just created in js on that page load) as a default?
[14:36:37] <thisboy> http://home.no/reddvinylene/test/ -- Anybody know why this Beyonce seamless fluid image Masonry (http://metafizzy.co/blog/beyonce-seamless-fluid-image-masonry/) crashes on mobile (AppleWebKit)?
[14:37:37] <bradmaxs> I keep getting a 500 internal server error with jquery ui autocomplete.  It works great on an Apache server but not on Windows, which is what I am using for this site. Any ideas?
[14:38:42] <tsalb> can anyone take a look at my jsfiddle? bit of a newbie here http://jsfiddle.net/grQwP/4/
[14:47:36] <fuzai> hey does anyone know of a custom alert box for query?
[14:47:51] <fuzai> sorry my auto correct keeps getting it
[14:48:14] <twk3> @tsalb within the change function the scope will be set to the input that was changed. You can use $(this).closest('[id$=test]') to find your div, and then scope the rest of your queries to that.
[14:49:17] <coldhead> ?modal
[14:49:27] <coldhead> oh, not-t :(

[14:53:08] <_julian> hi
[14:53:33] <_julian> is there an event like $.ready, which is fired when all loading caused by $(somelement).html is completed?
[14:55:10] <SparkOrb> hello, im having trouble with login box. it is disappearing when page fully loads. supporting jquery file is correctly declared, site with this issue http://shortefilms.com
[14:59:59] <coldhead> _julian: you could use .load() to bind a handler to the elements you are adding with html()
[15:00:04] <b-ot> coldhead: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[15:00:06] <coldhead> buuut it's probably only useful for images
[15:00:47] <_julian> coldhead: well yes, it's about images actually. but I would need to have an event when all images which are part of what I load with $(topelement).html() are loaded
[15:00:55] <nVee> hey guys, can someone help me with how I will gain access to the html of a label located before an input field?
[15:01:25] <coldhead> _julian: let me show you a little code that might help, please hold
[15:04:20] <sunbeam> whats the easiest way to set in jquery that textarea cannot be resized?
[15:04:34] <_julian> coldhead: doing something like $(".inner").load() which selects all my images works, but it's a bit crappy as the handler is called fr each image then. I only need one global completed event
[15:04:48] <tsalb> so im using parent().children('selector')...is there a more efficient way of doing this.... http://jsfiddle.net/grQwP/6/
[15:07:25] <coldhead> _julian: http://jsfiddle.net/9nt5L/
[15:07:28] <coldhead> how's that look?
[15:08:47] <SparkOrb> cool coolhead
[15:09:01] <coldhead> thanks sparksy!
[15:09:30] <_julian> coldhead: looks good. let me try it :)
[15:10:08] <sunbeam> whats the easiest way to set in jquery that textarea cannot be resized?
[15:11:28] <bobinator60> is anyone interested in taking a quick look at something? i can't get .append( someHTML ) to show up. https://gist.github.com/rbpasker/4716924
[15:11:50] <bobinator60> the line is question is 23
[15:12:10] <jrockjiggz> sunbeam: $('textarea').css({ resize: 'none' });
[15:12:18] <coldhead> jrockjiggz++
[15:13:48] <nVee> hey guys, I have the following code $(selected_form).find(":input").each(function() { ... } which works great but I want to add another condition to the each to only select fields which does not have a class called 'exclude'
[15:13:50] <sunbeam> jrockjiggz: thnx
[15:13:55] <nVee> is there a way to do this with the selector?
[15:14:19] <coldhead> .find(':input:not(.exclude)')
[15:15:01] <_julian> coldhead: thanks, it works :)
[15:15:14] <coldhead> hooray! have fun with that _julian
[15:15:20] <coldhead> name one of your kids after me
[15:15:25] <_julian> :)
[15:15:49] <_julian> hm. stop. it worked once. but after a reload it fails... mhmh
[15:16:41] <bobinator60> no takers on my gist?
[15:16:43] <nOStahl> hi guys, I got this http://pastebin.ca/2310943  does anything strike you as wrong in this code
[15:19:31] <Kocho> hey everyone! I have a grid of 15 products and then each of those has 6 configurations which I'd like to streamline somehow. Does anyone have any recommendations for a slider or something that comes out when one of the 15 is picked to then show the 6 configurations?
[15:24:42] <Kocho> hrmm maybe like an accordian
[15:43:55] <nVee> hey guys, I want to focus on the first input field which as a class called 'validator_element_error'. I tried the following but it does not appear to work, any ideas? $(selected_form).first("input.validator_element_error").focus();
[15:50:19] <c00kiemon5ter> nVee, i don't think first() takes an argument
[15:50:44] <c00kiemon5ter> $("input.validator_element_error").first().focus()
[15:54:28] <nVee> excellent thank you c00kiemon5ter
[15:54:54] <nVee> on focus, is there some sort of effect where I can slow down the focus (almost so that you can see the page scroll to the focused position?)
[16:05:34] <czytacz> hi
[16:07:38] <czytacz> i've written some code: http://pastebin.com/g4cLx6Sg and i'd like to have the commented out function to start working right after the "each" function finishes working. I have tried to put it in several places, with no effect :( Any ideas?
[16:08:26] <c00kiemon5ter> $("..").attr({ 'class' : 'your-value' });
[16:09:42] <czytacz> c00kiemon5ter: u're talking to me?
[16:09:54] <c00kiemon5ter> probably, not sure what you're trying to do
[16:10:46] <czytacz> the function in line 13 is fine itself. The prblem is that it is called before each() function finishes working
[16:11:24] <xec_> czytacz: the each is inside a click handler
[16:11:29] <c00kiemon5ter> yeah
[16:11:43] <c00kiemon5ter> the attr() will run once the document is loaded
[16:11:55] <c00kiemon5ter> each() will run once that selected item is clicked
[16:12:34] <c00kiemon5ter> http://pastebin.com/1HyDFubG you may want this ?
[16:12:36] <czytacz> that's right. But i don't know where to put this function.
[16:13:40] <xec_> czytacz: if you want it to execute immediately after the .each() then move it immediately after the .each() :P  what exactly is
[16:13:58] <xec_> what exactly do you want it to do? *
[16:14:42] <czytacz> c00kiemon5ter: no, your solution, which i tried earlier makes the function work on each loop. I want it to be called AFTER all the iterations have completed
[16:14:57] <c00kiemon5ter> ah
[16:15:34] <xec_> czytacz: then put it after
[16:15:49] <c00kiemon5ter> http://pastebin.com/RjWPAc7G like that :P
[16:16:04] <c00kiemon5ter> arg
[16:16:44] <czytacz> http://pastebin.com/MUUDqppE like this?
[16:17:02] <czytacz> well, this I've tried too
[16:17:14] <xec_> okay
[16:17:36] <xec_> what do you expect to happen, and what happens instead?
[16:17:37] <sampaka> i would like to call scrollto when click on a link <div id="gotostep3">LInk<a href="#"></a>  $('#gotostep3 a').click.scrollTo( {top:'1100px', left:'0px'}, 800 ); - clicking on a just goes up to page#
[16:17:38] <czytacz> the class is switched right after i click
[16:18:06] <xec_> you want it to happen after the animations?
[16:19:14] <shoky> think he wants http://pastebin.com/50zrvihw
[16:19:24] <czytacz> when i click, the opacity animation starts. I want to switch the class AFTER all animations finish working. I presume that the class is switched after all animations have STARTED without waiting for them to finish
[16:19:50] <shoky> actually  dont think that'd work for that tab array
[16:20:55] <xec_> yeah, it's an array of collections rather than just a collection
[16:21:07] <czytacz> shoky: didn't work
[16:21:09] <xec_> a bit redundant
[16:21:24] <shoky> czytacz: cause your array is weird :\
[16:21:33] <czytacz> what do You mean?
[16:22:00] <shoky> what xec_ said
[16:22:25] <xec_> czytacz: try var tabs = $(".a1, .b2") etc instead of var tabs = [$(".a1"), $(".b2")]
[16:22:27] <czytacz> I have 12 elements on page, described by classes. How am i supposed to point to them otherwise?
[16:22:43] <czytacz> okay, will try that
[16:23:10] <xec_> or if they all have a common classname just do $(".myCommonClassname")
[16:23:52] <xec_> (in case you didn't know, you can have multiple classes on any element)
[16:24:50] <czytacz> xec_: I know, but I didnt want them to be called in default order. That's why I did it with tab
[16:25:34] <czytacz> I'll put the code to jsfiddle
[16:26:18] <shoky> you can still do $('.commonClassName').promise().done(...)  after your .each()
[16:26:35] <coldhead> _julian: that is the classic "images from cache don't fire a reload event" problem
[16:27:17] <czytacz> shoky: okay, will try that
[16:29:40] <xec_> czytacz: i'm off to bed, good night! listen to shoky, he knows his shit ;)
[16:29:55] <shoky> nite xecy
[16:30:01] <sampaka> how do i select <a class="gonext">Link</a> => is it $('.gonext')?
[16:30:08] * xec_ hugs shoky
[16:30:17] <systemfault> sampaka: You win.
[16:30:20] <sampaka> ;)
[16:30:21] <sampaka> great
[16:30:26] <systemfault> sampaka: Selectors works like CSS
[16:30:45] <czytacz> xec_ thanks
[16:31:20] <sampaka> so now i want that when i click on the link something is triggerd => is it $('.gonext').click()
[16:32:39] <tw2113> ?on
[16:33:33] <systemfault> Bad bot!
[16:33:51] <systemfault> sampaka: For everything related to event… use .on
[16:34:00] <tw2113> it must be off spending all its $()
[16:34:27] <sampaka> ok
[16:34:33] <tw2113> b-ot, i am disappoint!
[16:36:44] <czytacz> shoky: changing to var tab = [$(".a1, .b2, .c4, .b1, .a4, .c3, .b3, .a2, .c2, .a3, .c1, .b4")]; made all elements animate at once
[16:37:17] <shoky> czytacz:  remove the [ ]
[16:37:42] <shoky> czytacz: and just do tab.each(...)
[16:37:50] <czytacz> okay
[16:37:58] <shoky> czytacz: but that might have the ordering problem you were talkin about
[16:38:16] <czytacz> yup, it does :(
[16:38:53] <czytacz> shoky: now it animates in sequence but the default one
[16:40:22] <shoky> czytacz: ya so you can leave it how you had it before.. might have better advice if i knew more about what yer doin there
[16:40:38] <czytacz> almost done with jsfiddle
[16:42:08] <czytacz> http://jsfiddle.net/CmEjS/
[16:43:10] <czytacz> I want to make the blocks dissapear first and after that make my big block arrive
[16:44:33] <shoky> so the fiddle works the way you want it to work?
[16:44:54] <shoky> er or the block appears too early?
[16:45:07] <shoky> you didnt do .done(function(){ ... })
[16:45:10] <czytacz> too earlyu
[16:45:27] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/CmEjS/1/
[16:45:51] <Ziggy`> Looks pretty neat
[16:45:57] <sampaka> $('.gonext').on("click", function(){alert('HELLO');}); there is no alert when clicking on my link <a href="#" class="gonext">link</a> - any idea?
[16:46:01] <czytacz> YES
[16:46:26] <czytacz> shoky: that's the case :D
[16:46:43] <czytacz> now it does what i wanted it to
[16:47:03] <Ziggy`> sampaka: Does the .gonext element exist on the page on load, or are you appending it to the dom later on?
[16:47:15] <sampaka> its on the page
[16:47:25] <Ziggy`> What jQuery version?
[16:47:31] <tw2113> shoky, who gave you permission to be helpful? :P
[16:47:52] <sampaka> ziggy: 1.4.4
[16:48:00] <digitalmediaguy> I am so stuck on this error: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'counter'…. AHHHH…. I've included the plugin… i can see it in the source… I then initialize the plugin in a script that's called AFTER the include of the plugin… what am I missing?  :-(
[16:48:36] <shoky> ;p
[16:49:00] <Ziggy`> sampaka: That's pretty old..
[16:49:11] <Ziggy`> sampaka: I'm not even sure if .on was available in jQuery 1.4 ?
[16:49:18] <systemfault> nope.
[16:49:22] <sampaka> ok so just click?
[16:49:38] <Ziggy`> go with .delegate I guess with jQuery 1.4.4
[16:49:43] <Ziggy`> But I'd seriously look into upgrading
[16:50:02] <Ziggy`> Or just go with .click if the element already exists in the DOM.
[16:50:08] <sampaka> it comes with drupal so i dont want to change this
[16:50:12] <sampaka> ok
[16:50:25] <sampaka> how would be the correct syntax .click()
[16:50:48] <Ziggy`> http://jsfiddle.net/z5HnN/
[16:50:51] <czytacz> shok: you have no idea how much time I've wasted looking for solution. I had no idea about promise().done() function. Thanks again :D
[16:51:18] <Ziggy`> sampaka: You need to do a return false there in the end if you don't want the visitor to actually visit the href of the anchor tag.
[16:51:43] <Ziggy`> But what i put up ought to work for jQuery 1.4.4
[16:51:55] <shoky> np czytacz
[16:52:07] <tw2113> just use the google cdn copy of jQuery for your drupal site
[16:52:12] <tw2113> get rid of the stock version
[16:52:22] <czytacz> shoky: it also resolves some of my other problems, which I wanted to walk around with sth like delay(). But it would suck a bit
[16:52:24] <sampaka> ziggy: thanks a lot
[16:52:32] <sampaka> it works
[16:53:34] <Ziggy`> np
[16:59:53] <czytacz> gnight everyone

[17:56:06] <rideh> Need some help with a project of mine. http://m.runyonsurfaceprep.com/calculators choosing a product and fillout out its form should trigger the js that has been loaded via globalEval() but it doesn't seem to work. Any tips on breaking this down?
[18:07:23] <leaetmika> hi i am doing an ajax load , to load refresh part of my page
[18:07:34] <leaetmika> the only thing is that the script on the page loaded is not executed
[18:08:17] <rideh> leaetmika: sounds similar to my situation, you have to use eval() on the code or globalEval()
[18:09:04] <leaetmika> @rideh where exactly ?
[18:10:19] <rideh> well.. in my situation you can look at lines 62-65 of my app.js file m.runyonsurfaceprep.com/js/app.js
[18:10:45] <rideh> and i see the code being loaded in my browser tools but it doesnt seem to register its event handlers as i'm expecting - it doesnt get triggered
[18:11:56] <c00kiemon5ter> you should both try a console.log(..) and check if the code reaches that point
[18:14:08] <leaetmika> @c00kiemon5ter just try when I run my page by itself i can see he log from the document ready , but the page is loaded via the load function () whatever is inside the doc ready is never called
[18:14:18] <rideh> c00kiemon5ter: mine does, as it evalutates the content replacement in the next line. though i guess i could just put a simple "console.log" inside the global Eval
[18:15:21] <MarkyC> How can I select a <p> with class "myClass" that is a child node of a <td> element?

[18:25:26] <ogk1000> anyone? plz plz
[18:26:12] <letterpress> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/z-index
[18:27:05] <rideh> ogk1000: thats a builtin via bootstrap. http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#affix
[18:27:27] <ogk1000> what
[18:27:31] <rideh> ogk1000: looks like they are using affix plugin
[18:27:40] <ogk1000> bootstrap??
[18:27:44] <ogk1000> its a few lines of JS I think
[18:28:48] <ogk1000> I'm thinkng I need a way to listen when the moving sidebar hits the bottom, change the position to absolute from static, then add a top margin thats the difference more or less
[18:28:54] <ogk1000> just not sure how to detect when it hits the bottom
[18:30:14] <rideh> ogk1000: its a plugin already out there. https://github.com/traversal/affix-for-jquery
[18:30:54] <ogk1000> thx let me check it out
[18:33:13] <MarkyC> rideh: I need to get /this/ td's specific p.myClass
[18:33:23] <MarkyC> not all td > p.myClass
[18:33:55] <MarkyC> rideh: something like $(this).children('p.myClass')
[18:38:54] <ogk1000> TBH rideh that seems way too heavy for what im tryign to do
[18:40:24] <jrockjiggz> $('p.myClass',this)
[18:42:54] <MarkyC> jrockjiggz: That didn't work, but passing 'this' as a parameter to the onMouseOver method allowed me to select it and not get undefined returned
[18:43:07] <MarkyC> jrockjiggz: Thank you very much.
[18:43:15] <mduvall> hi is there a way to determine which properties on the window object are non-native?
[18:51:51] <leaetmika> @rideh did you find a way to run the document ready on the page loaded via ajax ?
[18:52:10] <rideh> dont use document ready :) why would you need to do that
[18:52:49] <rideh> once it evals it should run it and assign triggers if i understand properly
[18:53:29] <leaetmika> i never used eval before not sure where to use it in my case
[18:54:09] <leaetmika> I  am loading an entire middle div via JQuery Ajax call and I simply want to run $(document).ready on the loaded page
[19:01:26] <letterpress> leaetmika what are you trying to do? do something after the ajax section loads?
[19:02:11] <leaetmika> yes the only thing is that all of my code is on the page loaded don't want to move all the code from every page loaded to the page that load everything
[19:02:16] <leaetmika> does that make sense for you ?
[19:02:39] <leaetmika> in my page header.php I do the load function for each page of my website
[19:02:53] <leaetmika> on each page i have the document.ready function with some code
[19:03:15] <leaetmika> when i run the page by itself the code is called but via the pad function it does not
[19:03:17] <letterpress> not really, sorry! was that a yes? so, you need to do something after the ajax call returns successfully?
[19:04:06] <leaetmika> yes basically after the ajax call is successful i have to run the document.ready of the page loaded
[19:05:16] <letterpress> well, you can't run document ready.
[19:05:36] <letterpress> but perhaps both document ready function and the ajax success function can both call the same function
[19:06:02] <letterpress> …if i understand you correctly.
[19:06:53] <leaetmika> if header.php load welcome.php via the load function can i create a function in welcome.php that i will call from header load callback ?
[19:09:26] <leaetmika> @letterpress can i do something like that
[19:09:27] <leaetmika> http://jsfiddle.net/EcXzK/
[19:10:22] <leaetmika> not sure that $this refer to the page and can be used to call a js function
[19:10:24] <letterpress> that makes more sense. i think so?
[19:10:53] <letterpress> yeah i have no idea what $this or $next is, but i sure hope you do!
[19:11:36] <leaetmika> @letterpress yes sorry
[19:11:37] <leaetmika> http://jsfiddle.net/EcXzK/1/
[19:11:41] <leaetmika> custom var
[19:12:03] <leaetmika> but can you confirm that $this.init() will call the init function in the loaded page >
[19:12:05] <leaetmika> ?
[19:12:10] <leaetmika> is it the right syntax ?
[19:13:49] <letterpress> um, i'm not sure what  "this" is, would like recommended reading on how to organize javascript?

[20:25:24] <nesoi> anyone here use JQM?
[20:31:01] <naeluh> nesoi: yeah I know a bit about have you seen this http://jquerymobile.com/test/
[20:40:20] <nesoi> naeluh : thanks. I'm trying to display a contacts list in a phone app, and I'm finding that in older phones it hardly scrolls at all... it's super extra ultra slow. I'm wondering if there's anything that can be done about that?
[20:41:45] <systemfault_> Define: older phone
[20:41:50] <naeluh> nesoi: have you looked at the supported platforms list http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/about/platforms.html
[20:41:59] <systemfault_> Pre-smartphone era?
[20:42:01] <naeluh> yeah which phones
[20:42:23] <fat> systemfault: are u good with boostrap?
[20:42:36] <systemfault_> fat: I used it once… for a CMS
[20:42:43] <systemfault_> So I'm not an expert.
[20:42:49] <naeluh> does this count http://hearinginformed.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/rotary-phone.jpg
[20:42:54] <naeluh> haha
[20:42:56] <systemfault_> :D
[20:43:21] <fat> systemfault: well i loaded bootstrap.css into my website but it stuffed up all the font sizes and font settings. is there bootstrap css file without the base text settings?
[20:44:08] <naeluh> fat: you can adjust the setting on the download page
[20:44:24] <fat> naeluh: ok looking now
[20:44:33] <systemfault_> fat: Not that I know of… bootstrap is more like a thing you start with
[20:44:54] <naeluh> fat: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/customize.html
[20:45:10] <fat> naeluh: should i uncheck all the base stuff
[20:45:40] <naeluh> fat: that would be a good start but I think you have to experiment  to get what you want
[20:46:18] <fat> naeluh: i alreayd have my base stuff (eg heading 1 heading 2)
[20:47:00] <naeluh> fat: ok but I think in bootstrap theres a main override for alot of the font stuff
[20:47:13] <fat> naeluh: what does that mean. sorry im new to css
[20:47:16] <systemfault_> Just adding bootstrap in the middle of a project is asking for trouble.
[20:47:22] <naeluh> haha
[20:47:31] <naeluh> yeah
[20:48:13] <nesoi> naeluh : this is android 2.3.3 which is supported
[20:49:51] <naeluh> fat: actually there isnt maybe just unminifiy the css and just change the items you need too but that can be scary
[20:50:21] <fat> naeluh oki
[20:50:50] <fat> naeluh: do i use the minified version?
[20:52:25] <naeluh> nesoi: Id look in here and see if theres a pending bug or solution to the issue if not maybe maybe post an issue you may have found a bug here is the got repo https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile
[20:52:38] <naeluh> git*
[20:53:33] <naeluh> fat: use minfy at the end when your done you can minify your script here http://www.cssminifier.com/

[21:25:15] <systemfault_> No such thing as a constant in JS… just assign a variable to the window object..

[21:36:19] <PalJQ> Hello
[21:52:00] <polm23> Question: I'm looking at code that gets a selection before the DOM is ready and trying to figure out why it works
[21:52:12] <ChrisBolton> Is there a way to do a toggleClass passing two parameters that way if I click an element once it's icon-chevron-up, click it again it becomes icon-chevron-down.
[21:53:15] <danheberden> ChrisBolton: just call it twice
[21:53:28] <micz123> hi a newbie here, want to ask a question: is jquery.data() is reliable enough across browsers (especially IE)? Because i read in the docs (since I dont really know what it means, I assume it means jquery.data() wont work on IE)--> Note that this method currently does not provide cross-platform support for setting data on XML documents, as Internet Explorer does not allow data to be attached via expando properties.
[21:53:44] <danheberden> ChrisBolton: or you can pass multiple into toggleClass
[21:54:16] <danheberden> .toggleClass( 'icon-chevron-down icon-chevron-up' )
[21:54:27] <danheberden> and assuming that one or the other was already added
[21:55:06] <ChrisBolton> danheberden: So if one of them was already selected then it'll switch to the other?
[21:55:49] <tw2113> <a class="icon-chevron-down" href="#" id="foo">Bar</a>
[21:56:16] <tw2113> $('#foo').toggleClass('icon-chevron-down icon-chevron-up');
[21:56:27] <tw2113> first click would rmeove the down, but add the up
[21:56:34] <tw2113> second click would remove the up and add the down
[21:58:30] <ChrisBolton> tw2113 & danheberden: Thanks.
[22:00:12] <ChrisBolton> It works perfectly.
[22:13:08] <djQuery> tw2113,  <a class="icon-chevron-down" href="#" id="foo">Bar</a> $('#foo').toggleClass('icon-chevron-up');
[22:13:28] <djQuery> tw2113, that should be good enough if the icons are the same size
[22:15:45] <djQuery> ChrisBolton, ^^
[22:16:44] <ChrisBolton> djQuery: Thanks.
[22:24:01] <rideh> need help http://m.runyonsurfaceprep.com/calculators after selecting product globalEval is called and while most of it works event for form submission does not get prevented. How can I ensure that the eval'd code that gets fired runs properly?
[22:26:34] <lethjakman> hey, I have a $("#object").click and the second someone touches it it'll load execute the code inside of it. this is turning out to be a problem when they're scrolling.
[22:26:39] <lethjakman> is there something better to use?
[22:31:32] <PalJQ> Hi ...Atleast tell about how to convert "02/06/2013 12:00" to US or UK Local date time
[22:32:30] <PalJQ> Please share if you have any idea about that....
[22:33:00] <systemfault_> 1) you use UTC time on the server
[22:33:09] <PalJQ> Yes
[22:33:18] <systemfault_> 2) You use moment.js to convert it to the current user's locale
[22:33:22] <systemfault_> 3)...
[22:33:25] <systemfault_> 4) Profit!
[22:34:29] <coldhead> you can't convert that time to another timezone until you decide what timezone it's in originally
[22:35:37] <rideh> lethjakman: example site?
[22:38:04] <systemfault_> coldhead: That's why UTC is sexy
[22:38:31] <tw2113> UTC is almost as sexy as that JSON guy
[22:38:48] <systemfault_> O_O
[22:38:52] <rideh> i hate time, why can't it be base 12 like everything else….  :P
[22:38:52] <PalJQ> @coldhead my req is i have a set off "01/31/2013 19:34" date and time format and then i  having dropdown which list off  country with time zone's.......Based on time zone i wanna convert the date time list
[22:39:06] <PalJQ> now this is possible or not
[22:39:38] <systemfault_> Sure.. you'll need to add/remove the hours yourself.
[22:41:28] <coldhead> alert('This site works best when you are in Greenwich, UK');
[22:42:14] <systemfault_> Haha
[22:42:25] <PalJQ> @systemfault i am not get
[22:42:36] <systemfault_> You're POST then?
[22:42:44] <systemfault_> badum tish...
[22:43:00] * Cork gives systemfault_ a drum
[22:43:19] <rideh> would someone help me figure out what is going on with my issue? Im still learning how to debug all of this event driven stuff. http://m.runyonsurfaceprep.com/calculators select a calculator, it fires a globalEval() that loads some JS in to interrupt the normal form post. It's not working though although other code called in globalEval() is working properly.
[22:44:48] <Cork> rideh: eh... why are you using globalEval?
[22:45:16] <rideh> Cork: can probably get away with eval, but since it wasnt binding to prevent default on the form submission event i tried stepping up to global
[22:45:18] <coldhead> yeah globalEval was the death knell for my high hopes of being any assistance
[22:45:39] <Cork> rideh: i meant eval at all is a scary thing
[22:45:42] <coldhead> why are you using any kind of eval
[22:45:52] <Cork> rideh: as that opens up to executing anything
[22:46:27] <rideh> All ears on how i can get around it, each of those products requires js specific to the product
[22:46:28] <coldhead> it's also hellish for scoping
[22:46:28] <Cork> there normally isn't a reason to use eval
[22:46:58] <coldhead> js specific to the product for me usually means <script src="appname.js"> specific to each product
[22:47:11] <Cork> rideh: so why don't you just send the response as js instead of json (that actively prohibits active content)
[22:48:01] <rideh> i could make individual js instead of storing it in the db but wouldnt it still have to be called with eval as the product gets chosen
[22:48:03] <coldhead> Some people when faced with a problem think "I know, I'll use JSON". Now they have unexpected token.
[22:48:13] <JBlitzen> Haha
[22:48:17] <coldhead> getScript() when the product gets chosen
[22:48:30] <rideh> can i not do that against the field in the db?
[22:49:15] <rideh> the problem is that without pre-loading functions and matching forms for each of these products and then hide/show them on selection i need a way to bring in new code on the fly that targets the same form template
[22:49:43] <rideh> also I want to be able to manage updates to the scripts (vendor changes mix ratio) through the front end of the site instead of updating files on server
[22:49:44] <Cork> rideh: that is getScript
[22:50:04] <rideh> can i not .getScript against a field in a response?
[22:50:19] <Cork> you send json back
[22:50:24] <Cork> opps soryr
[22:50:26] <Cork> *sorry
[22:50:30] <rideh> ultimately i want to re-write how this is done but right now we ahve a trade show going on
[22:50:31] <Cork> you send javascript back not json
[22:50:34] <rideh> and i need to get this working quickly
[22:50:39] <rideh> it is temporary..
[22:50:54] <Cork> rideh: shouldn't be much work to get it done right
[22:51:02] <rideh> cork beyond my skill to do quickly
[22:51:02] <Cork> just remove the json server side
[22:51:08] <Cork> and then just use getScript
[22:51:11] <Cork> the reset should just work
[22:51:34] <Cork> as your sending javascript stringifided in json
[22:51:41] <Cork> and thats just dumb
[22:52:19] <rideh> i'd like to create a schema for each product that identifies what formulas can be used for calculating costs, then rehydrate this populating fields to be used by the js function as hidden elements and determinging proper formula as well as labels. but until i can figure out a smooth way to do that, i'm kinda hacking it
[22:53:18] <rideh> Cork:  even if i change how that is working, what would that change about the form submit event not getting handled?
[22:53:22] <Cork> rideh: well, be warned that eval has lost of weird characteristics, and your problem might just come from that
[22:53:33] <rideh> Cork: ah, thats what i was looking for
[22:53:47] <Cork> rideh: you remove the unknown of what variables are in your scope and a few other ugly things
[22:54:57] <Cork> rideh: also the problem is most likely in the code you send as the response
[22:55:10] <Cork> so its hard to debug for third party
[22:55:44] <rideh> Cork: yeah i'm trying to shoehorn it abit, its the same code that gets used on the product pages where the form shows up a bit differently. here's a link to an example: http://m.runyonsurfaceprep.com/products/510826bd172679eda6dd1c12
[22:56:23] <rideh> i hadn't adequately planned to be using the js on the fly like i am now. Origionally it was happening server-side
[22:56:33] <Cork> you mean the Product "Page Calculator Widget Submit - Update Quantity" section?
[22:56:41] <rideh> yes
[22:58:27] <JBlitzen> I want a sortable list where each item is also draggable to a separate div area
[22:58:39] <JBlitzen> This appears to exceed jquery-ui's abilities
[22:59:02] <JBlitzen> Closest thing seems to be to sort it by hand
[22:59:28] <JBlitzen> So that any drop back on that list panel appends the item back in its proper location
[22:59:42] <Cork> js> "1" * "1" * (undefined / undefined) * "1"
[22:59:44] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[22:59:49] <Cork> js> print("1" * "1" * (undefined / undefined) * "1")
[22:59:52] <b-ot> Cork: NaN
[23:00:01] <Cork> rideh: ^ thats what your calculating
[23:00:26] <Cork> #depth and #min doesn't exist on that page
[23:00:38] <rideh> Cork ? it calculates just fine, interesting how did you get that?
[23:01:03] <Cork> $('#depth').length == 0
[23:01:06] <Cork> in a console
[23:01:06] <rideh> the button updates with proper values for the prouct selected, but clicking the button unfortuantely doesnt update the value in the floating input to the right
[23:01:22] <Cork> and im talking about this page http://m.runyonsurfaceprep.com/calculators
[23:01:45] <rideh> ah, depending on which product you choose there are differnt variables used. some are width, length, depth, some are not
[23:01:51] <rideh> which is why the form and js have to change together
[23:02:05] <Cork> not really, but what ever
[23:02:35] <Cork> you could base the formulas on what element exists, and have just one function do it all
[23:02:56] <Cork> and that would most likely be easier to maintain
[23:03:00] <rideh> how would i do that?
[23:03:06] <rideh> thats really what i'm trying to achieve
[23:03:23] <JBlitzen> Oh, my code actually does sort the list, it just appends at the end instead of in the middle
[23:03:33] <Cork> if($('#depth').length == 0) { /* no depth so don't use it */ }
[23:03:55] <Cork> then just use a sum variable and do it step by step
[23:04:42] <Cork> var sum = 0; if($('#depth').length > 0) { sum *= $('#depth').val() / $('#length').val); }
[23:05:07] <Cork> opps an extea closing parentheses
[23:15:00] <martisj> is it possible to console.log out all events that fire on an element?
[23:15:18] <rideh> ok, i dont have time to refactor all of these products and get them updated as well as changing the way it all loads. I can generate js files for the products and change to using getScript(). It really needs a refactor but I don't have time to do it thoroughly as it needs.
[23:16:12] <rideh> why is getScript safer than eval()?
[23:17:47] <gf3> `evil
[23:17:49] <b-ot> gf3: eval is evil! Don't! Read: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2003/11/01/53329.aspx and http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2003/11/04/53335.aspx
[23:18:09] <JBlitzen> Oh wait
[23:18:15] <JBlitzen> I don't have to do this dynamically at all
[23:18:23] <JBlitzen> I'll be running it in ajax anyway
[23:18:35] <JBlitzen> Which I suppose is a different type of dynamic but whatever
[23:19:03] <JBlitzen> Hell, so I'm already to the json
[23:19:09] <JBlitzen> Man, jquery-ui is great
[23:19:11] <Cork> martisj: no, not without calling something that does it
[23:19:28] <Cork> martisj: that said, most development tools in browsers has options to log all events
[23:19:39] <martisj> Cork: alright thanks :)
[23:19:46] <Cork> though that normally generates HUGE amounts of logs
