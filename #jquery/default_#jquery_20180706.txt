[02:21:05] <anli> Why do Google Chrome take 1 second to initialize? I do not run tabs.
[02:21:32] <anli> Does it care about the urls in my bookmarks toolbar?
[02:21:56] <Cork> it is quite a lot of gunk it needs to read in the profile
[02:22:21] <Cork> (cookies, history, bookmarks certificates, blacklists...)
[02:58:20] <OnceMe> I am using flex like this from yesterday http://jsfiddle.net/teuvfo7d/7/ and when I add dynamically text with jquery boxes expand just fine, however when I remove the text dynamically, size of content class remains the same, can I somehow reset it or some other method?
[03:01:06] <Cork> OnceMe: hmm, that actually looks like a rendering bug in the browser...
[03:01:43] <OnceMe> :(
[03:01:45] <OnceMe> damn
[03:01:59] <OnceMe> any way to fix the bug on a css/jquery side?
[03:02:26] <OnceMe> can I reset height
[03:02:31] <OnceMe> when I rem text?
[03:03:14] <OnceMe> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/teuvfo7d/11/
[03:03:20] <OnceMe> hmm not reseting height as I can seee
[03:03:22] <OnceMe> :(
[03:03:32] <Cork> OnceMe: http://jsfiddle.net/teuvfo7d/13/
[03:04:57] <OnceMe> hmm
[03:11:23] <OnceMe> thanks
[03:11:28] <OnceMe> any idea why is this bug in browser?
[03:11:56] <Cork> though that said if you used flexbox instead of height: 100% that problem most likely wouldn't happen
[03:12:25] <Cork> but ya it is a bit too much mixture of things for me to grock where the problem comes from
[03:12:29] * Cork afk
[03:38:59] <dipak> I have two files, parent.html and child.html. child.html includes parent.html in it using jquery load(). now I want to change the element of the parent.html in child.html. How do it? It's like overriding feature in other programming languages.
[08:47:38] <hollusion> i have a naming question
[08:48:02] <hollusion> my table has checkboxes for each row and the head row has one to toggle all rows at once
[08:48:31] <hollusion> i put the code that applies the on click event logic into a function called toggleRows()
[08:48:48] <hollusion> but the function does not really "toggle" it only sets the events
[08:49:07] <hollusion> shall i name it togglifyRows? toggleableRows? or how would you name it?
[08:49:30] <hollusion> (strange question i know, just lokking for some ideas)
[08:50:39] <pavonia> rowClickHandler?
[08:50:54] <pavonia> toggleHandler?
[08:51:24] <hollusion> so a function that applies the click logic but does not do anything actively on exectution should be FooBarHandler()?
[08:51:28] <preference> checkboxToggler()
[08:51:36] <hollusion> thats nice
[08:51:45] <preference> or rowActiveToggler()
[08:51:58] <AdamPDotty1> selectAll() ?
[08:52:10] <hollusion> it does not actively select all on execution
[08:52:20] <hollusion> but i like what preference suggested, thank you
[09:18:41] <SaraDR> Hi humanoids! .. Since there is a document ready function, is there one that runs the code before anything else, or is that entirely handled by the DOM order of the script elements/imports?
[09:19:04] <Cork> SaraDR: ready is called in order
[09:19:15] <Cork> so if you want to go before you need to put it first
[09:21:37] <SaraDR> Cork, what I mean is something that runs before ordinary <script> tags, even if they are before the current in the DOM.
[09:21:47] <Cork> no
[09:22:03] <Cork> script tags are taken as the html parser finds them and handed to the script engine
[09:22:06] <SaraDR> Wouldn't have thought so, but was worth the shot. :(
[09:22:14] <SaraDR> Thank you anyhow!
[09:22:28] <MikeD_> how can something run before script tags?
[09:22:49] <MikeD_> isn't that server-side script?  :p
[09:22:50] <hollusion> inlince
[09:22:56] <hollusion> inline scripts
[09:22:56] <Cork> ex through the old event beforeScriptExecution that mozilla used to have :)
[09:23:50] <MikeD_> you mean like code in an attribute of a tag?  that's crazy
[09:24:01] <Cork> and it won't run before script tags
[09:24:15] <hollusion> MikeD_, it used to be en vogue in the old days
[09:24:16] <hollusion> :P
[09:24:20] <Cork> scripts run in parse order, there are no way around that unless you use libs that reorder it
[09:24:56] <MikeD_> hollusion: so did leaches and hacksaws as medical practice ... we stopped using them for ... reasons.
[09:25:09] <hollusion> correct :)
[09:25:19] <hollusion> well leaches still have a medical use though
[09:25:27] <hollusion> even hacksaws
[09:25:41] <hollusion> shouldve picked another example :)
[09:26:14] <MikeD_> the only other quack science I was thinking of was too difficult to put into words for irc
[09:27:37] <Cork> MikeD_: homeopathy?
[09:27:40] <MikeD_> most of the rest of the ignorance from the dark ages involves the church, and i don't like to mess with them in a public forum
[09:28:40] <MikeD_> homeopathy would be like Amish web development?
[09:29:04] <Cork> lol
[09:40:34] <hollusion> bloodletting
[09:40:37] <hollusion> that shit was metal af!
[09:41:00] <hollusion> (and stupid of course)
[10:13:18] <MikeD_> i thougt that was what the leeches was for
[10:54:52] <hollusion> bloodletting is literally draining blood through cutting open vains
[10:54:56] <hollusion> to get rid of "bad blood"
[16:12:23] <blakespot_wrk> re
[16:12:35] <blakespot_wrk> Can someone help me simply these two lines ?
[16:13:00] <blakespot_wrk> Note that .section-right is a distant parent or, say, a great grandparent of the class listed after it in line 2
[16:13:14] <blakespot_wrk> $('.flex-promo-text .promo-content').find('a').addClass('decor');
[16:13:24] <blakespot_wrk> $('.section-right .flex-promo-text .promo-content').find('a').removeClass('decor');
[16:14:44] <blakespot_wrk> I only want to add .decor to items under .flex-promo-text .promo-content if they are not descended from an element classed .section-right
[16:25:33] <robertmaxrees> blakespot_wrk can you setup a fiddle?
[21:07:20] <JohnDoe2> $.each(localStorage, function(key, value) { ... }); shows everything I need but it also spits key, getItem(), setItem()... all the functions. Any way to restrict that?
[21:13:46] <pavonia> What are trying to do?
[21:13:50] <pavonia> +you
[21:20:28] <shoky> [...Array(localStorage.length).keys()].reduce((o, i) => ({...o, [localStorage.key(i)]: localStorage.getItem(localStorage.key(i))}), {})
[21:20:32] <shoky> :-\
[21:54:05] <how2hack> hi, i've got a problem, i'm getting a type error 'steUp' when trying to pass $('#element').val() post data directly to the $.post shortand, is this not possible or am i doing something wrong?
[21:54:28] <how2hack> as post data*
[21:56:24] <how2hack> $.post( '/post', { element: $('#element').val() } ) is this possible? or do i have to put it into a variable?
[21:57:23] <how2hack> nvm there was a typo
[23:17:09] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/7ah5dbux/2/  event is not getting require result
[23:32:32] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/7ah5dbux/2/  event is not getting require result
[23:34:10] <Rockwood> any active here?
[23:42:28] <ryan_ford> in your html you have '.box' you want 'box'
[23:43:27] <Rockwood> yes
[23:43:32] <Rockwood> now another issue
[23:44:23] <Rockwood> this.text() is not valid syntax?
[23:44:36] <Rockwood> ohh
[23:44:45] <ryan_ford> this.textContent works
[23:45:58] <Rockwood> console.log($(this).text());  works for me
[23:46:03] <Rockwood> ryan_ford, thanks
[23:47:20] <ryan_ford> apparently, `this` is a regular js object in this case, so if you wanted to do it the jquery way, you would need to wrap this `$(this).text()`
[23:48:45] <ryan_ford> whenever your working with `this` and having unexpected results, it's usually a good idea to do a quick `console.log(this)` and make sure you know what you're working with
