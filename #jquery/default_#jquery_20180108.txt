[05:59:48] <Devi8> How do I grab all of the content between h2 elements?
[06:03:07] <Cork> Devi8: wrap the content in an element like a span or a div
[06:03:41] <Cork> Devi8: alternatively you would have to drop down to node and use a treewalker and check the text nodes
[06:04:05] <Cork> (i don't recommend that)
[06:04:36] <Devi8> Yeah, I was afraid of that. Thanks for your help.
[06:16:38] <Devi8> I'm trying to create a simple multiple level menu based on H2, h3, etc. within an article element. But the problem is that it's hard to determine when an h3 element exists in the content after an h2 element, and so on.
[06:23:22] <Devi8> How about this: Is there an easy way to determine the "level" of header so h3 would be 3?
[06:24:31] <senaps> does setTimeout() block?
[06:25:55] <pheonixsu> I am trying to capture the event thrown by Scrollspy without any success using - $('#navbar').on('activate.bs.scrollspy', function() { console.log('sparkle, sparkle'); });
[06:28:21] <Cork> Devi8: no
[06:28:31] <Cork> senaps: no, it is by definition async
[06:30:04] <Cork> pheonixsu: do you have a link to the lib or something like that?
[06:30:13] <senaps> Cork, im creating a list of objects, i don't know the length of them, i show them and give'em a timeout to remove from the Array, is that the correct way to do it?
[06:30:43] <Cork> senaps: you mean you only want to show them one at a time?
[06:31:11] <Cork> (aka show one wait the timeout show another one)
[06:31:55] <senaps> now, i query the server every 5 seconds and show all the result that has come back, i just set the remove-time for each of them.
[06:31:58] <senaps> no!
[06:32:39] <Cork> then you don't want to block i sounds like
[06:33:14] <Cork> either just add them and then start a timer after the loop
[06:33:27] <Cork> or what you're doing right now
[06:33:54] <senaps> https://jsfiddle.net/ryauecs7/  this is the code, i have access to each object, and it has a delete function.
[08:13:20] <Levin^> good morning
[08:13:40] <Levin^> I'm updating my current code, so I did a to-do list here:
[08:13:47] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ZvvXbJ?editors=1010
[08:14:23] <Levin^> what I need to do: if <p> have two or more <a>, show it as a slider
[08:14:45] <Levin^> I am a newbie, so I will need some help on making the code
[08:15:31] <Cork> is the page static or are you getting it from an ajax request or something?
[08:16:01] <Cork> also by slider do you mean a slideshow?
[08:16:07] <Cork> or a form field slider?
[08:24:28] <Levin^> Cork: all the content will come from a feed, automaticallt
[08:24:48] <Cork> Levin^: what updates the page then?
[08:24:57] <Levin^> unfortunately, we don't have direct access to that feed, so we can only treat it like that
[08:25:03] <Cork> cause modifying the html if something else is writing it won't work
[08:25:32] <Levin^> Cork: its already working on this page:
[08:25:33] <Levin^> http://34.234.87.242/releases/impulsionada-pelo-evento-grand-depart-dusseldorf-2017-a-capital-estadual-dusseldorf-segue-rumo-ao-ano-esportivo-de-2018-e-talvez-o-campeonato-europeu-de-2024/
[08:25:39] <Levin^> sorry for the long link
[08:26:40] <Levin^> if you notice, this page have three <a> going to images, but after the document is ready, it will only show one image
[08:27:54] <Levin^> the slider I found is quite simple, its link is commented on my fiddle
[08:30:26] <Levin^> what I need for now is to actually show all the images that aren't showing up
[08:30:50] <Cork> Levin^: you need to modify the code that writes the html
[08:30:55] <Cork> you can't really solve this separately
[08:31:02] <Levin^> in the first <p> in my fiddle, note that I added three image links, but it's only showing one
[08:31:07] <Cork> (cause every time it updates it will overwrite your changes)
[08:31:39] <Levin^> Cork: it won't update in the same post
[08:32:00] <Levin^> the feed creates new posts every time it updates, so the posts will remain mostly static
[08:32:11] <Cork> but you still need to be told when it updates
[08:32:23] <Cork> so again it need to hook into it
[08:32:55] <Levin^> I don't understand why my solution is a problem
[08:33:13] <Levin^> it is working, can't you see it?
[08:33:20] <Cork> Levin^: your code will run on page load, but the next time it updates your code won't run
[08:33:30] <Cork> so it will be missing for the new content
[08:33:48] <Cork> unless you get notificed of the changes the other script does
[08:34:02] <Levin^> the script runs in every post automatically
[08:34:12] <Cork> every post...?
[08:34:15] <Levin^> wordpress is configured to do it
[08:34:29] <Levin^> didn't you notice I was using wordpress?
[08:34:35] <Cork> so this isn't using ajax then
[08:34:57] <Levin^> well, my code works
[08:35:03] <Cork> sigh...
[08:35:17] <Cork> most likely (from me guessing) cause you do full page reloads
[08:35:27] <Cork> something i asked about from the start and you said you used ajax...
[08:35:31] <Levin^> I just need to make it interpret two of more <a> inside the <p>
[08:36:25] <Levin^> no, I didn't say ajax
[08:36:42] <Levin^> the pages do not use ajax
[08:38:38] <Levin^> should I do it like, if ($linkImage.length) convert the html to img, as arrays?
[08:38:54] <Levin^> how do I write that?
[08:43:36] <MikeD_> Levin^: what are you trying to do?
[08:47:54] <Levin^> MikeD_: inside my fiddle there's an explanation:
[08:47:57] <thykka> Levin^, this? https://codepen.io/anon/pen/VyyrWK
[08:47:58] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ZvvXbJ?editors=1010
[08:48:34] <Levin^> thanks thykka, I will read your code :D
[08:49:09] <MikeD_> it's funny that you call it a fiddle when posted to codepen
[08:49:46] <Levin^> I thought a fiddle is any kind of shared piece of code lol
[08:50:09] <Levin^> how should I call that?
[08:50:13] <MikeD_> https://jsfiddle.net/
[08:50:17] <Levin^> I know
[08:50:28] <thykka> jsfiddle -> fiddle, codepen -> pen
[08:50:34] <Levin^> oh lol
[08:50:52] <MikeD_> :)  i know it's an insignificant point, but that's what we do
[08:51:05] <Levin^> now I understand that "a pen by captain anonymous"
[08:51:07] <thykka> yes, i think we should debate this for at least 40min
[08:53:17] <Levin^> oh, you removed all the text at once lol
[08:53:53] <Levin^> I thought my comment on my pen would explain enough
[08:54:10] <Levin^> but I needed to remove the text only if the <p> had images inside
[08:54:19] <thykka> oh, right
[08:54:51] <thykka> then this https://codepen.io/thykka/pen/yppPvw
[08:55:29] <Levin^> ok :)
[08:56:16] <Levin^> when I grow up, I wanna be as fast as you
[08:56:30] <Levin^> jquery is mandatory in my area
[08:56:33] <Levin^> :/
[08:58:03] <MikeD_> btw, note that thykka used if($linkImages.length > 0)  ... i think that's better/cleaner to read than if($linkImages.length)
[08:58:24] <Levin^> I noticed that
[08:58:39] <Levin^> and had the same conclusion
[08:58:52] <MikeD_> i'm having a hard time convincing my team of that
[08:59:33] <thykka> it's the kind of thing that's fun to shorten out, but at some point it'll bite someone's ass :)
[08:59:34] <Cork> lots of developers care more about number of characters they need to type then the readability of the code (something your normally do a lot more)
[08:59:38] <MikeD_> they seem to like to do if( foo )  and i never know what "foo" is - object, string, array, etc.  and whatever it might be, it might be that they're checking for undefined
[08:59:39] <AdamPDotty1> it is a distraction
[08:59:55] <Cork> *you normally
[09:00:20] <thykka> considering how few people really remember all the edge-cases of JS converting values into boolean..
[09:00:31] <AdamPDotty1> If length is undefined I expect greater trouble than that
[09:00:37] <MikeD_> the one person keeps writing "foo.length > 0" when he's checking a string... but for me, ".length" implies an array, so that's weird too
[09:01:14] <Cork> MikeD_: hmm i do that one quite a lot though
[09:01:25] <thykka> foo.split('').length :P
[09:01:28] <thykka> but eh
[09:01:31] <Cork> lol
[09:01:35] <MikeD_> yeah, it's fine... i just trip over it
[09:02:09] <Cork> ya, when code syntax changes from different parts of the code you normally trip over it
[09:02:16] <Cork> doesn't really matter much why it differs
[09:02:22] <Levin^> lol
[09:02:54] <Cork> i hit one of my colleges over the head about that all the time
[09:03:16] <Cork> as he always writes things how he things it should be structured instead of following the style guidelines *sigh*
[09:04:02] <Levin^> how do people learn jquery today
[09:04:08] <Levin^> only by reading the docs?
[09:04:18] <Cork> learn.jquery.com ?
[09:04:22] <Levin^> hm
[09:04:40] <Levin^> let me get that link lol
[09:04:54] <thykka> jquery has a decent reference, that's pretty much all I use
[09:05:30] <AdamPDotty> I use Cork :-)
[09:07:43] <Levin^> oh, many of my references already came from that site lol
[09:14:29] <Levin^> thykka: I don't understand function(i, p)
[09:14:58] <Levin^> p is being used as a variable, right? what about i?
[09:16:35] <Levin^> index?
[10:53:09] <thykka> Levin^, index, yes
[10:53:51] <thykka> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/
[11:34:09] <Levin^> do I need to close a tag inside .append()?
[11:34:24] <taplar> no, you're appending dom nodes, not html
[11:34:32] <Levin^> hm
[11:48:37] <Levin^> I'm not sure how to get the URL of the images I have in my selection
[11:48:38] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/Vyyyyx?editors=1010
[11:49:05] <Levin^> in the JS tab, line 28
[11:49:34] <Levin^> I need to get the images of HTML tab, lines 13, 14, 15
[11:50:45] <Levin^> which means, I will make those three images as background-image of the <div id="slider"> created via jquery
[11:51:58] <taplar> $("div#slider ul li") is a global lookup
[11:52:36] <taplar> it's going to find all the lis in that ul
[11:53:28] <Levin^> I'd need to make it create as many li as it's available inside the <p>, in the HTML tab
[11:54:17] <Levin^> in the first occurence, there are 3 images inside the <p>
[11:55:14] <Levin^> thereby it will create 3 <li>
[11:55:37] <taplar> so you'd want to loop over the images found
[11:55:54] <Levin^> yes
[11:56:23] <Levin^> I have a loop above, but I'm not sure on how to make it with .css
[12:07:32] <taplar> the outer loop is on the p elements, not the images
[12:11:15] <jayjo> WHen I get some json back from a server, I am trying to create some dom elements of bootstrap cards with checkbox inputs on them in order to build the next request. I'm actually using d3 for this right now (there are visualizations elsewhere on the page). Using .data() is an easy way to create an element for each piece of data returned, but I know jquery is built exactly for this. Is there a way to either
[12:11:21] <jayjo> automatically create an element for each data object in an array with jquery?
[12:23:30] <Levin^> taplar: I got to make the loop, but I'm struggling with the background-image
[12:23:32] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/Vyyyyx?editors=1010
[12:24:12] <taplar> so i'm going to repeat what i said before
[12:24:14] <taplar> $("div#slider ul li") is a global lookup
[12:24:55] <Levin^> what does that mean?
[12:25:01] <taplar> what does that selector say?
[12:25:29] <Levin^> to select every div#slider ul li it can find
[12:25:35] <taplar> yep
[12:25:49] <taplar> and then you're changing the results background.  -all- of them
[12:25:58] <Levin^> yes
[12:26:04] <taplar> don't you just want to set the one you just made?
[12:26:47] <Levin^> I want to make each <li>'s background to correspond to the three <a> inside the first <p>
[12:26:51] <taplar_lunch> ideally, you'd create your li, set stuff on it, then append it.  not append it and then look it up
[12:27:01] <taplar_lunch> bbs
[12:37:31] <taplar_lunch> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/baajGr?editors=1010
[12:40:49] <Levin^> I understood what you said
[12:41:03] <Levin^> if I append, I can't get the previous content
[12:41:32] <taplar_lunch> ?
[12:44:23] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/XVVBdG?editors=1010
[12:44:32] <Levin^> this way it's easier to see the slider working
[12:45:26] <Levin^> I must change the value at the live 29 to get the data from line 13 to 1 of the HTML tab
[12:45:33] <Levin^> line*
[12:45:42] <Levin^> 13 to 15
[12:45:50] <taplar_lunch> maybe fix line 29 first?
[12:46:40] <Levin^> that's my goal
[12:47:02] <Levin^> I'm testing if I can use .attr to get the URLs
[12:47:50] <taplar_lunch> you can do direct property access off of the
[12:47:53] <taplar_lunch> 'b' variable
[12:48:59] <Levin^> I created the b variable, but I don't completely understand its functionality
[12:49:20] <taplar_lunch> http://api.jquery.com/each/
[12:49:32] <Levin^> thanks
[12:50:48] <taplar_lunch> the bottom most example shows the second argument being accepted
[12:51:56] <Levin^> the yellow squares
[12:59:05] <naftilos76> Hi, is there a fast way to get elements that have a data- sort_id attribute that equals from 4 up to 16 ? I can do it with find("...").each();
[13:00:05] <taplar_lunch> find on a tagName/class and then filter on the data element
[13:03:14] <naftilos76> taplar
[13:03:38] <taplar_lunch> hi hi
[13:03:43] <naftilos76> taplar_lunch, tagname is div and will always be div
[13:03:45] <Levin^> taplar_lunch: I'm still not getting the correct syntax
[13:03:46] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/XVVBdG?editors=1010
[13:03:58] <Levin^> line 28
[13:04:38] <taplar_lunch> $('div').filter(function(){ var sortId = $(this).data('sort_id');  return sortId > 3 && sortId < 17; });
[13:05:06] <taplar_lunch> Levin^: don't do that.  just do b.href
[13:05:14] <Levin^> uh
[13:05:36] <taplar_lunch> you're not doing anything else with it that requires it to be a jQuery object.  Changing it to a jquery object just for method access is unnecessary
[13:06:24] <taplar_lunch> also the css is expecting a string for that concatenation, not an object
[13:06:53] <Levin^> a string? then how do I make it work?
[13:07:01] <taplar_lunch> what did you comment out?
[13:07:20] <Levin^> just a sample background
[13:07:28] <taplar_lunch> but a url, right?
[13:07:33] <Levin^> yes
[13:07:46] <taplar_lunch> so, what on the 'b', a <a> link, looks like that?
[13:08:34] <Levin^> um
[13:08:49] <Levin^> $img = $("<img>").attr("src", b.href);
[13:08:58] <taplar_lunch> you don't need that image
[13:09:12] <taplar_lunch> all you are doing is taking that static url in the css, and replacing it with a variable of the url
[13:09:21] <taplar_lunch> which exist on ...
[13:09:44] <Levin^> $(a)?
[13:09:55] <taplar_lunch> except you don't need the $()
[13:10:22] <taplar_lunch> b.href is your url
[13:10:43] <Levin^> if I change to a.href, how do I refer to the other function?
[13:10:55] <Levin^> or I don't
[13:11:05] <Levin^> I should find b again?
[13:11:06] <taplar_lunch> you're variable is 'b'
[13:11:16] <taplar_lunch> what other function?
[13:11:36] <Levin^> I meant the line 8
[13:13:11] <Levin^> just $img = b.href; ?
[13:13:39] <Levin^> cool
[13:13:40] <Levin^> lol
[13:14:01] <Levin^> but the logic is boiling in my brain lol
[13:14:20] <Levin^> the .each comes from $linkImages
[13:14:36] <Levin^> the b is like a handler
[13:14:43] <Levin^> I see. lol
[13:14:44] <taplar_lunch> it's just a variable name
[13:15:17] <taplar_lunch> just like function x(man, cat){}  x('bob', 'kitten')
[13:15:22] <taplar_lunch> it can be whatever
[13:15:58] <taplar_lunch> as the api states, each() will pass in the index, element
[13:16:02] <Levin^> people use only one letter because they want
[13:16:08] <Levin^> it could be anything hmm
[13:16:15] <taplar_lunch> because developers are used to trying to make their code small
[13:16:21] <Levin^> I see
[13:16:26] <taplar_lunch> but it's not an issue with javascript if you minimize and uglify
[13:16:40] <taplar_lunch> which is why you should do those two and describe your logic in a readable fashion
[13:16:48] <taplar_lunch> instead of short naming things
[13:16:52] <Levin^> hm
[13:17:30] <hellyeah> hey
[13:17:35] <taplar_lunch> aloha
[13:17:43] <hellyeah> how goes
[13:17:58] <taplar> same as normal, :)
[13:18:06] <hellyeah> usual
[13:18:12] <hellyeah> same old same old
[13:18:23] <hellyeah> finally i return to field
[13:18:33] <hellyeah> i am writing code again YAY
[13:18:39] <taplar> awesome
[13:22:23] <hellyeah> i have one question as usual
[13:26:58] <hellyeah> i just want to update a column when you click edit button. Try to set contenteditable true but i cannot select the element it seems. Can you help me out? First time i work with vertical table https://jsfiddle.net/whf74gvk/5/
[13:27:47] <taplar> you want to make the fields in the column editable?
[13:28:50] <hellyeah> yes
[13:28:57] <hellyeah> contenteditable exist for that
[13:29:02] <taplar> so first you need to know which column you're in right?
[13:29:21] <hellyeah> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/contentEditable
[13:29:28] <hellyeah> yes
[13:29:32] <taplar> well, there are at least a couple ways to do this
[13:29:32] <hellyeah> event.target
[13:29:47] <hellyeah> this is the column i clicked
[13:29:54] <taplar> you can get the index of the cell in the row, so you know which column you need to manipulate in the other rows
[13:30:01] <hellyeah> as you see some columns have class "uupdatablefield"
[13:30:07] <taplar> or, you could give them all an individual class for each row and select on that
[13:30:20] <hellyeah> i picked second way it seems
[13:30:43] <taplar> ok, so you could put that class as a data attribute on the buttons
[13:30:52] <taplar> and then it's a quick lookup using that value as a class
[13:31:34] <hellyeah> data attr or class
[13:31:36] <hellyeah> btw
[13:31:49] <hellyeah> w3c reported us,ng data attr in td is a mistake
[13:31:49] <taplar> on the button i'd make it a data attribute
[13:31:54] <taplar> on the cells i'd make it a class
[13:32:05] <hellyeah> i see
[13:32:19] <hellyeah> i dont need updatablefield on button
[13:32:27] <hellyeah> i guess
[13:32:43] <taplar> it's not going to be just one class
[13:32:52] <taplar> you would have a specific one for each column
[13:33:27] <hellyeah> that i have
[13:33:32] <hellyeah> on seperate columns
[13:33:46] <hellyeah> is that what you meant right?
[13:34:03] <taplar> i don't see that in the fiddle you provided
[13:34:27] <hellyeah> humm
[13:35:06] <hellyeah> <td class="updatablefield">4</td><td
[13:35:14] <hellyeah> you didnt see that?
[13:35:25] <taplar> only on the last two tds, and that's not unique per column
[13:35:49] <hellyeah> last two columns you can update
[13:35:56] <hellyeah> does it have to be unique?
[13:36:00] <taplar> then why do you have edit buttons under the other ones?
[13:36:01] <hellyeah> i didnt understand that
[13:36:27] <hellyeah> thats a good question
[13:36:32] <hellyeah> this is just an example
[13:36:41] <hellyeah> but i need to avoid that too
[13:36:51] <hellyeah> thats good point to emphasize
[13:37:06] <taplar> if you want me to offer advice about an issue you have, don't provide an example with things that don't mirror the desired result, :)
[13:37:27] <taplar> cause i'm going to assume you want those fixed
[13:37:56] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:38:02] <hellyeah> what is your advice?
[13:38:16] <hellyeah> i guess create edit button dynamically
[13:38:22] <taplar> make your fiddle look like what the end result should look like
[13:38:30] <taplar> then ask about the broken parts
[13:38:46] <taplar> or not really the end result
[13:38:54] <taplar> make it look like what your actual issue looks like
[13:39:27] <taplar> does your actual code have those edit buttons under all the columns?
[13:40:45] <hellyeah> all columns can be updatable actually
[13:40:56] <hellyeah> here https://jsfiddle.net/whf74gvk/6/
[13:41:20] <taplar> ok, so now the class needs to be unique per column
[13:41:33] <taplar> if you are going to bypass the positional logic
[13:42:05] <hellyeah> you man different class for per column?
[13:42:20] <hellyeah> mena?
[13:42:22] <hellyeah> mean*
[13:42:24] <taplar> "unique per column"
[13:42:41] <taplar> is unique an unknown word?  yes.  different
[13:43:00] <hellyeah> different class for each column
[13:43:03] <taplar> unique = without duplication
[13:43:03] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:43:22] <hellyeah> okey butin that case i need to change my logic right
[13:43:42] <taplar> if you didn't have to change your logic, you wouldn't be working on a problem, eh?
[13:44:16] <hellyeah> actually this logic is working when table is horizontal
[13:44:52] <taplar> so there isn't a problem
[13:45:12] <hellyeah> you mean like that
[13:45:14] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/whf74gvk/7/
[13:45:35] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/whf74gvk/8/
[13:45:37] <taplar> yes and no
[13:45:41] <taplar> unique "per column"
[13:46:00] <taplar> those are just unique
[13:46:40] <taplar> do you understand the "per column" requirement?
[13:46:48] <hellyeah> each column
[13:46:54] <hellyeah> right
[13:46:59] <taplar> so what has to change?
[13:47:05] <hellyeah> each column has different claass
[13:47:20] <taplar> but within each column?
[13:47:48] <hellyeah> i guess not
[13:47:58] <taplar> no you're on the right track
[13:47:59] <hellyeah> can you explain "per column" in more detail?
[13:48:10] <taplar> i'm just trying to get you to verbalize what is desired
[13:48:45] <hellyeah> i just try to change the value of column
[13:48:47] <taplar> a unique class per column, means the class in each column is different, but with in each column they are ...
[13:49:00] <hellyeah> by selecting that column with class information
[13:49:21] <hellyeah> so you mean
[13:49:33] <hellyeah> 1,2,3,4,5 | 1,2,3,4,5 | 1,2,3,4,5
[13:49:35] <hellyeah> ?
[13:49:56] <taplar> | signifying the end of a row?
[13:50:16] <hellyeah> yes
[13:50:29] <taplar> so look back at my sentence ending in ...
[13:50:32] <taplar> finish that sentence
[13:50:38] <Neo4> i don't knwo about you are speaking
[13:50:46] <taplar> a unique class per column, means the class in each column is different, but with in each column they are ...
[13:50:55] <taplar> oh different person
[13:51:03] <hellyeah> i would say they are same
[13:51:06] <Neo4> hellyeah: each column has his own class, and you can choose all data from there
[13:51:21] <taplar> so with that sentence, does what you gave with the | match?
[13:52:04] <hellyeah> i would say YES
[13:52:10] <taplar> so do it!
[13:52:23] <Neo4> hellyeah: yes, what do you want to select? Say more understandably question, probably we can help you
[13:52:38] <taplar> Neo4: he's working through it.  please let him work at it.
[13:52:43] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:53:04] <Neo4> ok
[13:53:18] <hellyeah> taplar,  https://jsfiddle.net/whf74gvk/9/
[13:53:44] <taplar> yep, but please use tidy to remove the unnecessary whitespace
[13:53:47] <taplar> it's hard to read
[13:53:50] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah btw you don't have jquery included on there and you're missing quotes around click
[13:53:54] <hellyeah> i am sorru
[13:54:49] <hellyeah> taplar, robertmaxrees  https://jsfiddle.net/whf74gvk/11/
[13:55:07] <hellyeah> i will be more careful next time taplar
[13:55:08] <taplar> ok, so now you got your classes on the columns
[13:55:18] <hellyeah> yes
[13:55:19] <taplar> it's not a problem, it's just hard to read like i said
[13:55:25] <Neo4> hellyeah: don't understand what you want to do on click event.
[13:55:30] <hellyeah> dude
[13:55:33] <hellyeah> let me
[13:55:35] <Neo4> hellyeah: I'll help
[13:55:39] <robertmaxrees> Neo4 taplar's already got it :)
[13:56:01] <taplar> so now you have an identifier that matches for each column
[13:56:02] <hellyeah> i have classes yes
[13:56:02] <robertmaxrees> you can read the logs at http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/latest.log.html to get a sense of what he's trying to accomplish.
[13:56:16] <taplar> so now we need to tie each class to the button related to it
[13:56:19] <Neo4> hellyeah: use this $('td.your_needed_class').each(function(event){});
[13:56:29] <hellyeah> Neo4,  stop please
[13:56:49] <robertmaxrees> Neo4 you're just confusing him now.
[13:57:08] <hellyeah> actually i am focusing on taplar
[13:57:11] <Neo4> hellyeah: I see you have main problem you don't understand how reach needed eleemnt
[13:57:17] <dimi1947> I am trying to get the values of cheked input boxes but I cannot....while one is 0 and the other is 1 I get 0 and 0...here is the code:https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/n04odgff/18/
[13:57:23] <hellyeah> Neo4,  i will ignore you
[13:57:37] <hellyeah> you don listen people
[13:57:37] <Levin^> I applied my code on my page (it's a long link, sorry):
[13:57:40] <Levin^> http://34.234.87.242/releases/impulsionada-pelo-evento-grand-depart-dusseldorf-2017-a-capital-estadual-dusseldorf-segue-rumo-ao-ano-esportivo-de-2018-e-talvez-o-campeonato-europeu-de-2024/
[13:57:45] <Neo4> hellyeah: ok :) I'll silence
[13:57:46] <Levin^> it's the slider
[13:57:50] <hellyeah> Neo4,  same attitude
[13:57:58] <taplar> lets just work on the issue
[13:58:08] <robertmaxrees> brb
[13:58:18] <Levin^> if you inspect it, you'll notice it's duplicating the elements several times
[13:58:39] <hellyeah> taplar,  i am reading
[13:58:45] <hellyeah> ah
[13:58:46] <Levin^> the jquery is here: http://34.234.87.242/wp-content/themes/salient-child/js/scripts.js
[13:58:48] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:58:49] <hellyeah> okay
[13:58:54] <hellyeah> i read your sentence now
[13:59:08] <Levin^> lines 110 to 201
[13:59:11] <taplar> and what did i say earlier you could use on the button to specify the value?
[13:59:44] <hellyeah> we need to tie each class to the button related to it
[13:59:57] <taplar> and how can we do that?
[14:00:08] <hellyeah> thinking about that
[14:00:24] <hellyeah> ah okey i see
[14:00:37] <hellyeah> so edit will have related column class
[14:00:49] <Neo4> hellyeah: you want when you press edit to pop up windows and edit those column data? Your edit button should has name of column class, use data attribute for it
[14:00:49] <taplar> yup, but how?
[14:00:54] <hellyeah> first edit button have updatable1 class
[14:00:58] <hellyeah> like that
[14:01:07] <taplar> use a data-* field instead
[14:01:18] <hellyeah> Neo4,  stop man
[14:01:24] <taplar> class makes sense on the columns, because you want to select them
[14:01:33] <hellyeah> i will do something now
[14:01:39] <Neo4> hellyeah: oh, ok, but this is simple task.... very simple, it's basics
[14:01:40] <hellyeah> just give me a sec
[14:01:42] <taplar> but on the button, data-* makes more sense because you are applying non-standard information to the element.
[14:07:00] <hellyeah> taplar,  i tried this https://jsfiddle.net/whf74gvk/12/
[14:07:44] <taplar> i'm looking at your edit buttons, but i don't see the class defined on them any where
[14:08:59] <hellyeah> i just supposed i assigned class to related edit button dynamically
[14:09:05] <hellyeah> is it false assumption?
[14:09:16] <taplar> for now, not dynamically
[14:10:12] <hellyeah> than my edit button should have class updatablefield1... updatablefield5 all of them
[14:10:15] <hellyeah> ?
[14:10:28] <taplar> but as a data field
[14:10:37] <hellyeah> why data btw?
[14:10:51] <taplar> because it is a singular value that will be used to find other things
[14:10:55] <taplar> class is a list
[14:11:02] <taplar> or can be a list
[14:11:52] <taplar> it's like if you had something like
[14:11:58] <Neo4> hellyeah: for you it will useful get class using $(this).data('class') for example
[14:12:09] <taplar> <tr data-user="Me" data-name="Jim" data-age="11">
[14:12:35] <Neo4> inside click event callback function
[14:12:46] <taplar> it doesn't make sense to make those classes.  data fields let you define the values on the element in a way that associates the data to what they are
[14:13:21] <hellyeah> taplar,  so https://jsfiddle.net/whf74gvk/13/
[14:13:44] <taplar> looks like an old fiddle.  they all have the same class again
[14:14:12] <taplar> and why did you put all the classes on each edit button?
[14:14:20] <hellyeah> sorry wrong one
[14:15:25] <hellyeah> taplar,  https://jsfiddle.net/whf74gvk/15/
[14:15:48] <taplar> alright, so explain this: data-field="updatablefield1 updatablefield2 updatablefield3 updatablefield4 updatablefield5"
[14:16:47] <taplar> i'm going to click an edit button, and then i'm going to use the value in the data-field to know which class to look up
[14:16:59] <taplar> how can i perform that logic with that ^
[14:20:23] <hellyeah> why click didnt work
[14:20:24] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/whf74gvk/18/
[14:20:40] <hellyeah> oh
[14:20:50] <taplar> you going to answer my last couple questions?
[14:21:14] <hellyeah> by selecting correct element
[14:21:26] <hellyeah> i mean
[14:21:27] <taplar> given what you have the field set as, how?
[14:21:34] <hellyeah> selecting element with correct way
[14:21:42] <taplar> given what you have the field set as, how?
[14:22:01] <hellyeah> can you be more clear?
[14:22:10] <taplar> data-field="updatablefield1 updatablefield2 updatablefield3 updatablefield4 updatablefield5"
[14:22:32] <hellyeah> with data-field
[14:22:37] <taplar> how do i know if i click the first edit button, that i should select the updatablefield1, if the field is set like that
[14:22:45] <taplar> no dude
[14:22:56] <taplar> the purpose of the field is to tell you which -specific- value to use
[14:22:58] <hellyeah> you can check
[14:23:10] <hellyeah> with if
[14:23:14] <taplar> no dude
[14:23:24] <taplar> why do you need an if?
[14:23:38] <taplar> you just tell it which value to use.  you don't give it multiple values.  that defeats the purpose
[14:23:44] <hellyeah> sorry
[14:23:50] <hellyeah> you just go up with closest
[14:23:58] <taplar> closest is the tr
[14:24:01] <hellyeah> and find thhe element in that row
[14:24:10] <taplar> and now you're falling back into positional logic
[14:24:24] <taplar> i'm going to stop trying to help if you're not going to listen
[14:24:55] <hellyeah> okey
[14:25:02] <hellyeah> let me focus again
[14:25:43] <taplar> what's the purpose of the data-field?
[14:26:09] <hellyeah> purpose of data-field is to know which spesific class you use
[14:26:27] <taplar> alright, so fix that part
[14:27:07] <hellyeah> when you click edit button
[14:27:20] <hellyeah> you have to get class attribute
[14:27:25] <taplar> y?
[14:28:13] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:29:30] <hellyeah> actually i dont know
[14:29:44] <taplar> so fix your markup first and then lets talk about it
[14:31:28] <hellyeah> jsiddle didnt report anything to me
[14:32:21] <taplar> taplar
[14:32:21] <taplar> what's the purpose of the data-field?
[14:32:28] <taplar> hellyeah
[14:32:28] <taplar> purpose of data-field is to know which spesific class you use
[14:32:34] <taplar> taplar
[14:32:34] <taplar> alright, so fix that part
[14:32:48] <taplar> o.o
[14:33:57] <hellyeah> so each td will have data-field attribute?
[14:34:12] <taplar> where did you read that?
[14:34:26] <hellyeah> my mibnd stopped
[14:34:28] <hellyeah> sorry
[14:34:37] <taplar> i'm really having a hard time understanding how you keep jumping to different places
[14:34:52] <taplar> the data-field is on the edit button
[14:34:57] <hellyeah> yes
[14:34:58] <taplar> that's the issue we were talking about
[14:35:02] <hellyeah> yes
[14:35:13] <taplar> so.... where did tds come from?
[14:35:23] <hellyeah> i dont know anyway
[14:35:38] <hellyeah> you mean button can have one data-field
[14:35:40] <hellyeah> ?
[14:35:50] <taplar> dude ...
[14:36:33] <hellyeah> hm
[14:37:10] <taplar> https://imgur.com/UaDySeQ
[14:37:43] <taplar> the data-field tells you which specific class you need to select, when you click the button
[14:37:52] <hellyeah> yes
[14:37:55] <hellyeah> thats it
[14:38:03] <hellyeah> okay
[14:38:05] <hellyeah> yeah
[14:38:08] <hellyeah> shit
[14:38:11] <hellyeah> sorry
[14:38:14] <taplar> so fix your markup to be that
[14:38:44] <hellyeah> damn it
[14:38:48] <hellyeah> okay
[14:38:51] <hellyeah> i am stupid
[14:38:56] <hellyeah> now i got it
[14:41:35] <hellyeah> is it smt like that https://jsfiddle.net/whf74gvk/19/
[14:42:04] <taplar> almost!
[14:42:13] <taplar> data('data-field') .  take off the data- part of the key
[14:42:19] <hellyeah> i dont know it must be psychological
[14:42:20] <taplar> data() does that automatically for you
[14:46:48] <hellyeah> okay
[14:47:15] <hellyeah> select the element
[14:50:50] <hellyeah> it should work https://jsfiddle.net/whf74gvk/20/
[14:51:25] <taplar> what selector are you using?
[14:51:46] <hellyeah> td
[14:51:52] <taplar> ?
[14:52:04] <taplar> find($class)
[14:52:09] <taplar> what is $class?
[14:52:21] <hellyeah> $class is updatablefield1 for example
[14:52:30] <taplar> is that a tag name/id/class ?
[14:53:00] <hellyeah> it seems it is just a string there
[14:53:10] <taplar> they're all strings
[14:53:19] <taplar> but what does it refer to?  tag/id/class ?
[14:53:33] <hellyeah> must be tag
[14:53:40] <taplar> what -should- it be?
[14:53:49] <hellyeah> class
[14:53:56] <taplar> so how do you fix that?
[14:54:13] <hellyeah> wrapped with $ ?
[14:54:25] <taplar> what is the syntax of a class selector?
[14:54:41] <hellyeah> $('.smt')
[14:54:49] <taplar> ^^^
[14:55:13] <hellyeah>  $('.' + $class)).attr('contenteditable', true);
[14:55:19] <taplar> :)
[14:56:04] <hellyeah> okay
[14:56:06] <hellyeah> damn
[14:59:14] <hellyeah> taplar,  sometimes i am stoned
[14:59:27] <taplar> no comment, :P
[15:01:05] <hellyeah> one way or another
[15:01:09] <hellyeah> it is gonna be good
[15:07:08] <hellyeah> taplar,  this is i am after https://jsfiddle.net/whf74gvk/22/
[15:07:46] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah what do you notice with all of those button handlers?
[15:07:46] <taplar> k
[15:08:37] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees,  is it bad practice?
[15:09:05] <robertmaxrees> nah, they're all just super similar.  i woudln't worry too much about it.
[15:13:24] <hellyeah> yeah it is simple
[15:13:34] <hellyeah> funny thing is i can do some harder stuff
[15:13:39] <hellyeah> anyway
[15:13:53] <hellyeah> after struggling too much this is just adoptation
[15:14:05] <hellyeah> i just started new position with better salary
[15:14:12] <hellyeah> it is my first project at work
[15:14:22] <hellyeah> i already gt my second project
[15:14:30] <hellyeah> hope it goes well
[15:36:19] <taplar> woot woot, green jasmine test
[15:38:56] <robertmaxrees> noice
[15:40:21] <hellyeah> wat
[15:40:35] <taplar> my javascript tests went green
[15:42:56] <Levin^> is there any security issues on creating DOM elements on jquery?
[15:43:17] <taplar> is this related to your text() thing the other day?
[15:43:31] <taplar> err, html()
[15:43:46] <Levin^> yes, my boss went concerned bout that
[15:43:59] <taplar> like i said then.  if jquery has a security issue, then javascript has an issue
[15:44:07] <taplar> you just have to be aware of what the methods do
[15:44:47] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:45:21] <robertmaxrees> Levin^ where the data coming from when you use .html()?
[15:46:00] <Levin^> robertmaxrees: from the jquery itself
[15:46:05] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:46:18] <robertmaxrees> what are you passing to .html() ?
[15:46:19] <Levin^> .append, .html, etc
[15:46:34] <robertmaxrees> those methods alone are not dangerous - it's about what you pass them.
[15:46:45] <taplar> iirc, it's a select with an option that has escaped html, and then they are taking that value and appending it to a div or something, getting the value with html() and html is unescaping it, causing the script to execute on append
[15:46:50] <Levin^> <div>, <a>, <p>
[15:46:54] <Levin^> tags like that
[15:47:14] <robertmaxrees> Levin^ right, but are the bodies of those tags originating from user input?
[15:47:27] <Levin^> no
[15:47:33] <Levin^> from a RSS feed
[15:48:00] <robertmaxrees> so if the RSS feed itself becomes compromised, that's the attack vector.
[15:48:07] <Levin^> I see
[15:48:21] <robertmaxrees> jquery itself isn't inherently insecure in this case.
[15:48:29] <Levin^> then it's as safe as their feed system
[15:48:35] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[15:48:37] <Levin^> ok
[15:48:52] <taplar> and as safe as your logic implemention
[15:48:54] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:49:52] <taplar> nothing programming wise, i believe it is safe to say, can honestly say "use me, and don't worry about security"
[15:56:51] <Levin^> I'm quite concerned with backend panguages, like php
[15:56:58] <Levin^> languages*
[15:57:22] <taplar> how so?
[15:57:22] <Levin^> because I see lots of people telling other people to properly sanitize their code
[15:57:36] <taplar> you mean sanitize their data?
[15:57:51] <Levin^> err
[15:58:01] <taplar> you can't trust the user
[15:58:15] <taplar> you have to perform validations
[15:58:19] <Levin^> I meant code, but now I don't exactly know anymore
[15:58:56] <Levin^> you sanitize user input data, is that how it works?
[15:59:11] <taplar> you sanitize anything that may have invalid values
[15:59:23] <taplar> because you not only want to protect yourself, but your users
[15:59:26] <Levin^> hm
[15:59:41] <taplar> an attacker could send in data that is meant to harm your system
[15:59:53] <robertmaxrees> like a script tag that you then write back out to the page.
[15:59:56] <taplar> or, they may send in data, that does nothing to you, but when you return it to another user, does something harmful
[16:00:02] <robertmaxrees> that script tag can do all sorts of nasty stuff.
[16:00:24] <Levin^> hm
[16:00:48] <robertmaxrees> this is why you sanitize data on its way in and out.
[16:00:58] <Levin^> I see
[16:01:40] <Levin^> you also said nothing programming wise can be trusted as secure
[16:01:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:02:01] <taplar> inputs from users
[16:02:10] <taplar> or from data sources
[16:02:20] <taplar> anything that 'could' be corrupted
[16:02:24] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:02:41] <robertmaxrees> an rss feed could theoretically get hijacked.
[16:02:46] <Levin^> I heard couple days ago about a vulnerability envolving computer processors
[16:02:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:02:56] <robertmaxrees> Meltdown and Spectre
[16:03:18] <taplar> iirc, most of the browsers are already patching for it
[16:03:21] <Levin^> and every system that uses those processors are prone to those vulnerabilities
[16:03:32] <robertmaxrees> Levin^ that's a whole different beasty.
[16:03:33] <robertmaxrees> *beasty
[16:03:36] <robertmaxrees> wtf hahahaha
[16:03:50] <taplar> you're a fan of the boyz.  it's ok
[16:03:53] <Levin^> oh, so that's their names
[16:03:58] <Levin^> lol
[16:04:00] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, browser vendors are already patching, OS vendors are patching, intel released a patch....
[16:04:53] <Levin^> I thought those vulnerabilities couldn't be patched by software
[16:04:59] <Levin^> hm
[16:05:26] <robertmaxrees> the js-based attacks can be mitigated.
[16:06:17] <Levin^> that's good
[16:08:57] <robertmaxrees> https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/01/03/mitigations-landing-new-class-timing-attack/
[16:09:52] <robertmaxrees> the important thing, tho, is that this is simply one class of attack.
[16:10:05] <robertmaxrees> there are many others that I'd be more concerned with tbh.
[16:12:18] <pr0xy__> Hey Guys
[16:12:27] <pr0xy__> how can I force select in a data list?
[16:12:40] <robertmaxrees> pr0xy__ could you clarify?
[16:13:34] <pr0xy__> I have a html data list, and I want to force user to select a option of the list
[16:13:48] <robertmaxrees> do you want to notify them on submit of a form or something>?
[16:14:06] <pr0xy__> Yes, it's a form
[16:14:45] <pr0xy__> in the data list there are customers, and users must select one of them
[16:14:50] <pr0xy__> sorry for my bad english
[16:16:46] <ceiba_> yo
[16:16:55] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/pewfp0wf/ this is the simple way to make sure they entered something pr0xy__
[16:16:56] <taplar> hello
[16:17:10] <robertmaxrees> you could easily expand that to include checking if the value matches at least one of the options.
[16:18:24] <pr0xy__> can you explain how? @robertmaxrees
[16:18:46] <robertmaxrees> pr0xy__ you could use .filter() on the options.
[16:18:55] <robertmaxrees> pass it a function that checks the value and see if it matches.
[16:19:01] <robertmaxrees> if you get 1 element, you're g2g
[16:19:33] <pr0xy__> okay thanks robertmaxrees , I will try
[21:41:24] <milk> newb question - https://wiki.thingsandstuff.org/Living - why isn't the .click on line 3212 triggering the menu sublevel hide?
