[04:08:57] <iaj> Hi folks! i got a question -- when I want to create a "lever pulldown effect" that is associated with a certain actoin with jQuery-- does anybody know a viable solution for that?
[04:09:05] <iaj> *action
[05:15:43] <jquery_noob> hey guys
[05:15:58] <jquery_noob> I can select an element using document.getElementById but not via jQuery selector
[05:16:01] <jquery_noob> what gives?
[05:16:09] <jquery_noob> it's a td element
[05:17:28] <localh0st> jquery_noob: what is the question?
[05:17:40] <jquery_noob> what gives?
[05:17:42] <jquery_noob> haha i'm kidding
[05:18:00] <jquery_noob> how is it possible that I can select an element via document.getElementById but not via $('#id')
[05:18:20] <jquery_noob> I am doing this through the browser console
[05:20:22] <localh0st> jquery_noob: this is core DOM function, I guess jquery is using this as well in the backend
[09:59:32] <Caspan> Question i have the following site 3bit.io that lets me drag and drop files onto it to upload
[09:59:49] <Caspan> I have an event listiner on the background image to handle this
[10:00:23] <Caspan> but i want to pop up a cool drop you file here background so the user knows they can drop a file on the site when they drag it
[10:00:38] <Caspan> jsut some feed back so the user know they can drop a file there
[10:00:57] <Caspan> is there a simple way to replace the background image with a new one when you drag a file onto it?
[10:01:53] <Caspan> ver dimple example but somethign like an image like this
[10:01:53] <Caspan> https://liberty.service-now.com/drop%20files.PNGx
[10:02:00] <Caspan> very simple example *
[10:03:16] <Caspan> another example  http://ajaxuploader.com/images/drag-drop-file.gif
[10:05:33] <Caspan> what my idea solution is to have a DIV 100% VH by 100% vw that is hidden that the listener is on, then have it show with a z-order of 2 when a file is dragged to the browser then hides when dropped or cancled
[10:07:52] <Caspan> $(document).on('dragover', function(e) {  ?? i am assuming that
[10:09:02] <TViernion> Morning all
[10:32:24] <localh0st> Caspan: 15:59 < Caspan> I have an event listiner on the background image to handle this
[10:32:37] <Caspan> localh0st: ok
[10:32:49] <Caspan> it will handle the file drop
[10:33:08] <Caspan> but i can move the listener to another object if needed
[10:33:52] <localh0st> Caspan: if you have a listener, does this listener allows you to detect the event when your file is dragged over the image?
[10:33:55] <Caspan> $(document).on('dragover', function(e) {}); that only seems to fire when i hover over page elemets but not on the background for some reason
[10:34:15] <Caspan> localh0st: I am using SimpleAjax Uploader script
[10:34:18] <Caspan> I dont think so
[10:34:27] <Caspan> its a minified code
[10:34:31] <localh0st> Caspan: because it's listener set on complete document...
[10:34:41] <Caspan> and i dont want to alter their code for future update considerations
[10:34:48] <localh0st> $(document).on('dragover', '#backgroundImage', function(e) {});
[10:35:05] <localh0st> maybe this will work?
[10:35:10] <Caspan> localh0st: Okay, humm
[10:35:25] <Caspan> I want this listener to detect the second a file is dragged tot eh page anywhere
[10:35:40] <Caspan> they it will make the div display
[10:35:44] <Caspan> then*
[10:35:56] <Caspan> can i put it on body then?
[10:36:20] <jost> Hi! I want to test asyncronous functionality using QUnit - say I want to check that a promise is resolved after something happens. I can do that using 'assert.async()'. But if the promise is not resolved, the test should fail. But instead, it hands infinitely... here is an example which just hangs the test run: http://dpaste.com/1YZE1XB
[10:36:41] <jost> Is there some way to put a timeout on the done function or something?
[10:38:25] <localh0st> Caspan: I don't undestand this:
[10:38:26] <localh0st> hover over page elemets but not on the background
[10:38:32] <Caspan> sorry
[10:38:36] <localh0st> what is page elements and what is the background?
[10:38:37] <Caspan> let me explain better
[10:39:00] <Caspan> i want this even  to trigger the second a file is dargged onto the page anywhere
[10:39:16] <Caspan> event*
[10:40:06] <Caspan> file is dragged to page, fire function... , file leave page, fire function, file is dropped, fire function
[10:41:26] <Caspan> so basically liten for file dragged to document, if it is show a div that is hidden, if file is dropped, hide element, if file drag is canceled or leaves hide div
[10:42:22] <Caspan> but i can only get $(document).on('dragover', function(e) {}); to file it i hover a file over an element
[10:42:30] <Caspan> to fire*
[10:42:44] <Caspan> but does not fire when hovered over the BG
[10:43:10] <JorgeChavezH> morning
[10:43:17] <Caspan> i want it to fire if a file is dragged anywhere in the document
[10:43:20] <Uhkis> Caspan: try $('*')
[10:44:08] <Caspan> okay that works
[10:44:14] <Caspan> its that not a bit intense though
[10:44:25] <Caspan> adding a listener to every element?
[10:45:43] <WhirledPress> Caspar, when you want that behavior draw a div over the entire document and add the linstener to the div.
[10:46:04] <taplar> i wonder if $(document.body) would behave differently than document
[10:46:37] <Caspan> taplar: testign
[10:46:43] <Caspan> WhirledPress: Thats a good idea also
[10:46:53] <Caspan> allow click through
[10:48:00] <Caspan> taplar: same result, only fires when you go over page elements
[10:48:06] <Caspan> like buttons and images
[10:48:10] <taplar> booo
[10:48:23] <Caspan> i think WhirledPress idea is the proper way to do it
[10:48:41] <Caspan> put a skirt over the page with the listiner on it with click through enabled
[10:48:44] <taplar> i'm not sure you idea of click through will work
[10:49:10] <Caspan> sure CSS  pointer-events: none
[10:50:00] <taplar> so if you have a button under an overlay with the pointer-events: none, the button can still be clicked?
[10:50:07] <Caspan> yep
[10:50:11] <taplar> interesting
[10:50:13] <Caspan> from what i undersatnd
[10:50:27] <WhirledPress> So you are capturing a click event when the file is dropped?
[10:50:57] <taplar> if you get that to work, let me know.
[10:53:03] <localh0st> Caspan: so now, you have to decide if the file was put onto page or not?
[10:53:32] <Caspan> localh0st: there will be a listener when the file is dropped
[10:54:04] <localh0st> ok
[10:54:05] <Caspan> file dragged over the page coversing div will fire event to show the drop div
[10:54:14] <Caspan> page covering div*
[10:54:31] <Caspan> that div will show up with the "Drop you file here logo crap"
[10:54:46] <Caspan> the listener for a dropped file will be on that div
[10:55:06] <Caspan> then hide it once dropped and reset back to normal
[10:55:08] <Caspan> easy LOL
[10:55:32] <localh0st> yeah, you have a couple of events to cover still
[10:58:46] <WhirledPress> Plus you could handle the mouseover event to disable the file catcher div's events because mouseover shouldn't fire if drgover does
[10:59:02] <Caspan> taplar: got to 3bit.io
[10:59:15] <Caspan> i have the skirt over it now adding pointer-events: none; lefts me click through it
[10:59:23] <Caspan> works nice
[10:59:35] <Caspan> now i can add listeners to that skirt
[10:59:52] <Caspan> hopefully it will see the file darg with pointer-events: none; set..
[11:01:48] <Caspan> haha
[11:01:50] <Caspan> catch 22
[11:02:09] <Caspan> so with pointer-events: none; set it does not catch things being dragged over it
[11:02:28] <Caspan> but if i remove the CSS for pointer-events: none; it works perfect
[11:02:37] <Caspan> but then i cannot click on anythign on the page
[11:03:10] <WhirledPress> can you check if mouseover is fired (than it must not be dragging), so disable it?
[11:03:29] <Caspan> good call
[11:03:31] <Caspan> checking
[11:04:33] <Caspan> nope
[11:04:37] <Caspan> damn
[11:04:38] <WhirledPress> and in order for dragover to work, you have to lose focus
[11:05:32] <WhirledPress> and dragging over a file  doesn't register focus on the document till you drop the file. So perhaps you can only enable the skirt with you lose focus on the doc
[11:05:42] <Caspan> I am suprised ther eis not a listiner built in to listen for drags to the window
[11:07:35] <Caspan> I love coding :)
[11:07:43] <Caspan> all the little problems and learning
[11:10:48] <Caspan> seems like everyone's examples all have a single element for dragging the file over to cause the event to trigger
[11:11:27] <WhirledPress> I personally think that's best. It sucks when you grab the wrong file and accidentally let go over the main window...then it uploads.
[11:11:48] <WhirledPress> It's better to have a designated area that if I change my mind, I can release the file wihtout it transfering.
[11:11:58] <Caspan> well i can do that also
[11:12:11] <Caspan> make a div show and only the center you can drop on it
[11:12:43] <Caspan> I just want to give user feed back as they drop a file onto the page that this is allowed
[11:12:52] <Caspan> like the way google photos does it
[11:13:00] <Caspan> maybe i need to peak at their code
[11:15:07] <Caspan> well i know '*' works for now
[11:15:18] <Caspan> I just dont like adding listeneres to ever single element
[11:16:06] <Caspan> i can add the listener to the background and just hope they dont drag into the window over an elemetn
[11:16:09] <WhirledPress> None of the mouse events happen when you drag a file over an inactive window. It has to be inactive to grab the file. What event activates the window when you drop the file?
[11:16:32] <Caspan> no it fires as soon as you ddrag the file over it it focuses again
[11:17:06] <WhirledPress> not here it doesn't...It just says copy+ until I release the file
[11:17:39] <Caspan> go to 3bit.io
[11:17:44] <Caspan> opne the developer console
[11:17:55] <Caspan> and drag a file to it you shoudl get TEST
[11:18:03] <Caspan> dar a file to the page sorry
[11:18:07] <Caspan> err
[11:18:24] <Caspan> drag a file to the page, console should say test as you drag it over the BG
[11:18:29] <WhirledPress> When I have the file over the page, but haven't rreleased the mouse button, there's no way for th epage to know
[11:18:57] <WhirledPress> I could be dragging to any tab I have open.Chrome is still inactive at that point.
[11:19:06] <Caspan> not sure i can see it working in Chome right now, as you drag the file over the browser window it focus it
[11:19:43] <WhirledPress> I'll try to capture a screen shot. brb
[11:19:49] <Caspan> event is firing as expected for me
[11:19:56] <Caspan> NP
[11:20:07] <Caspan> but only when its dragged over the BG
[11:20:16] <Caspan> so that will wokr for me
[11:21:31] <valenpo> hello
[11:21:56] <valenpo> Anyone know how to use theme roller for old one 1.8.24 ?
[11:23:48] <Caspan> WhirledPress: there got it to work
[11:23:58] <valenpo> With 1.8.24?
[11:24:01] <Caspan> try it now, drag a file to the page and it will turn white
[11:24:25] <Caspan> that div shows and now i just need to add my drop listener to that page and then hide the page once dropped
[11:24:38] <Caspan> sorry hide the div once dropped
[11:28:16] <Caspan> bingo go it working but its a bit flakey
[11:28:30] <Caspan> drag a file on the skirt/overlay shows
[11:28:38] <Caspan> drop the file it uploads
[11:28:44] <Caspan> and skirt goes away
[11:29:02] <valenpo> Anyone?
[11:29:05] <Caspan> sorry i keep calling it a skirt.. overlay goes away
[11:55:30] <Caspan> WhirledPress: try it now.. all working for me 3bit.io, drag a file over you see the message, drag it off it disapears, drop the file it upload and overlay goes away!
[11:55:33] <Caspan> i love coding!
[14:15:06] <taplar> it's so slow in here, you'd think it was monday..... or tuesday
[14:15:18] <MassDebates> or friday
[15:27:31] <taplar> maybe i should start trolling S.O. with some "Maybe you should ask the chatroom" comments
[15:31:04] <Caspan> jquerry is dead is why..
[15:31:11] * Caspan ducks....
[15:31:31] <Caspan> it has been quiet evywhere on IRC
[15:31:32] <taplar> if only
[15:39:13] <Valduare|Work> hmm how do you keep jquery from continually appending a variable to the url if you refresh the page
[15:40:08] <robertmaxrees> Valduare|Work jquery doesn't do that by default.
[15:41:44] <Valduare|Work> hmm
[15:42:07] <Valduare|Work> i need a way to add a variable to url when someone submits a form so the variable shows up on the confirmation page :P
[15:42:43] <MikeD_> how are you submitting the form?
[15:43:23] <Valduare|Work> its some form plugin on wordpress site
[15:43:41] <taplar> you could always use sessionStorage/localStorage instead of the url
[15:44:30] <MikeD_> if the form uses "GET" method, then it's already added to the url... if it's using POST then the content is in the post payload, your server can respond with whatever details it wants to marshal into the output
[15:46:08] <Valduare|Work> the form is set to redirect to a custom url after submission
[15:46:25] <Valduare|Work> so there’s prob nothing in post available still ?
[15:46:43] <Valduare|Work> i’d assume its processing it to save in db with whatever action they use and then redirecting after that
[15:47:30] <MikeD_> heh, this reeks of the third party marketing stuff we used to do at my former employer  :)
[15:50:26] <robertmaxrees> Valduare|Work why not save info to the user session server-side instead?
[15:50:57] <MikeD_> sounds like he's agnostic to the form plugin and its internals
[15:51:27] <Valduare|Work> ya dont want to mess with the plugin itself
[15:51:52] <MikeD_> so if the response page is supposed to say "Thank you $firstname" then you probably could get away with Taplar's local storage suggestion
[15:52:00] <Valduare|Work> just adding a unique number thats saved in the db to check against before displaying anything on the confirmation screen
[15:52:35] <MikeD_> unique numbers are harder to manage than you'd think
[15:53:06] <MikeD_> sure, you can just "plus one" to get another but how do you know how many others have already "plussed one" ?  :)
[15:53:29] <taplar> what's the purpose of the number?
[15:53:40] <Valduare|Work> ya there’s nothing in post just checked
[15:54:07] <MikeD_> transaction confirmation number really should be generated by the server (imo)
[15:54:16] <Valduare|Work> it is generated by the server
[15:54:23] <Valduare|Work> and saved into the db
[15:55:39] <MikeD_> is the redirect happening with a server redirect or javascript on a intermediate page?
[15:56:16] <Valduare|Work> part of the plugin
[15:56:56] <taplar> is it you or the plugin that is putting the thing in the url?
[15:57:13] <Valduare|Work> i am
[15:57:31] <taplar> on the client side?
[15:58:13] <Valduare|Work> i dont know the best practice for handling this hhe
[15:58:38] <taplar> on the client side?
[15:58:52] <Valduare|Work> i wrote a php function thats generating the numbers and using ajax to insert it into a hidden element on the form
[15:59:38] <taplar> and then your client js is taking that form element and putting it in the url?
[15:59:40] <Valduare|Work> and then was using jquery to add it to the url to pass it to the confirmation page then i can on the php side get the variable from the url to compare against the db
[16:00:03] <robertmaxrees> sounds like he could attach it to the user session in the backend and call it a day (shrug)
[16:00:05] <taplar> ya, so instead of doing that you could set it as a localStorage or sessionStorage variable to be used
[16:00:15] <taplar> or server session, either
[16:00:31] <Valduare|Work> its just a case of me not knowing whats possible and then starting to write code heh
[16:01:54] <taplar> http://php.net/manual/en/book.session.php     https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage
[16:05:28] <Valduare|Work> hmm that may be what im looking for
[16:45:56] <FatBoyXPC> I have some bootstrap tabs with a datatable report in each tab. Each one of these reports has a download to excel button on it. It appears as though the first tab that loads is the only set of export buttons that will work.
[16:46:21] <FatBoyXPC> If I try switching tabs and clicking on the excel button, nothing happens. Any ideas?
[16:48:28] <robertmaxrees> repeating IDs or anything like that?
[16:49:26] <FatBoyXPC> Not that I can tell, no. I just checked the relevant hrefs in the nav-tabs and the relevant id's for the tab panes
[16:49:55] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see it then.
[16:53:48] <FatBoyXPC> robertmaxrees: That's the tough part. I can't easily duplicate this in jsbin, and there's some sensitive data so I can't really give you a login. I'm not sure how I can show you
[16:54:22] <FatBoyXPC> The developer I'm replacing did a lot of autowiring type stuff to make loading stuff into datatables "easier" - but I'm of the firm opinion he just made things more complicated as I've never had so many problems getting data to display w/DT.
[16:54:48] <robertmaxrees> i might head to the datatables forums in that case.  there's a good chance somebody there could help.
[16:57:00] <FatBoyXPC> Does the table have to be visible during initialization of table tools in order for them to work? Found an old SO Post that seems relevant to this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32369369/bootstrap-tabs-with-datatables-tabletools
[16:57:58] <FatBoyXPC> I'll give this a shot
[17:04:31] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea haha
[17:04:35] <robertmaxrees> never really used DTR
[17:04:37] <robertmaxrees> *DT
[17:05:48] <taplar> lucky man
[17:06:41] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[17:09:25] <FatBoyXPC> taplar: so true
[17:09:53] <FatBoyXPC> I just need to find the initialization code for dt buttons
[19:20:16] <raisen> is there a way to retrieve the complete callback off an element's animate function? I need to end the animation by using stop() but I want to hold off to call the complete callback until later on.
[19:45:06] <raisen> I created a jsfiddle for my question here: https://jsfiddle.net/9Lb8bejt/3/
[19:54:12] <cdwSymfony_> Hello...
[19:54:35] <cdwSymfony_> So I have a question... Give me a minute and I can gist what Ia m doing....
[19:56:50] <cdwSymfony_> This is a simplified pastebin of what I am trying to accomplish. https://pastebin.com/t2nnkiWM
[19:57:37] <cdwSymfony_> What I am trying to do is to grab the first column of the the two rows, take those and wrap them with a TR, then wrap those TR's with a Table.
[19:58:29] <cdwSymfony_> The end goal is to create a small table to absolute position on top of the the existing columns so that if the table scrolls the table to the left, the column will remain frozen.
[19:59:42] <cdwSymfony_> What I a finding is that in my little JS block, I grab the column heads, clone them, but the value in $rows never contains my wrapped TDs.
[20:00:09] <cdwSymfony_> CAn someone quickly spot what I am missing?
[20:01:10] <cannap> no
[20:01:16] <cannap> where is the real example
[20:01:25] <cannap> https://jsfiddle.net/
[20:04:36] <cdwSymfony_> sorry been a LONG time since I asked for help with jQuery related issue. https://jsfiddle.net/so0dxskg/
[20:05:23] <cannap> hm
[20:05:31] <cannap> you miss some declarations
[20:05:31] <cdwSymfony_> as the fiddle shows, head1head2 are the straight TD's they aren't being wrapped by the B tags.  I have tried B and TR.  And no go.
[20:05:55] <cdwSymfony_> I am missing some var's aren't I?
[20:06:04] <cannap> var =
[20:06:29] <cdwSymfony_> still no go.
[20:06:36] <cannap> what
[20:06:42] <cannap> this is js not php
[20:07:04] <cdwSymfony_> I use $variable to represent jquery wrapped values.
[20:07:27] <cdwSymfony_> it's a convention I picked up some time ago.
[20:07:50] <cannap> 	var  $columns = $('td.colhead').clone();$
[20:07:53] <cannap> 	var  $columns = $('td.colhead').clone();
[20:10:20] <cdwSymfony_> changed the variable names to be without $, no change.  I think the issue is around line 4, but I am not sure what is wrong with it.
[20:11:26] <cdwSymfony_> I have tried that line $("<br></br>").wrap(columns); and as it is in the fiddle.  Still no workie.
[20:13:16] <cdwSymfony_> https://jsfiddle.net/so0dxskg/2/ last fiddle I tried.
[20:16:18] <cannap> can you make https://paste.laravel.io/p4wwy this
[20:16:26] <cannap> to how it should look
[20:16:31] <cannap> before and after
[20:17:41] <cdwSymfony_> You want just the HTML structure I Want to end up with?  Okay.
[20:19:04] <cdwSymfony_> This is what I ultimately am looking to accomplish https://paste.laravel.io/Rorrg
[20:19:36] <cdwSymfony_> That table will eventually be statically positioned over the existing column.
[20:21:01] <cdwSymfony_> So if my understand of the jquery .wrap() function is that the elements given in the collection should be wrapped with the value passed as a parameter.  IT would appear that I cannot do that with detached html.
[20:21:18] <cdwSymfony_> html that has not be inserted into the DOM yet.
[20:22:01] <cdwSymfony_> Am I right?
[20:22:19] <cdwSymfony_> If that is the case is there a more approrpiate approach to do this?
[20:25:35] <nikio_> how to check if a character is visible
[20:25:48] <nikio_> so all the alphanumeric and typical symbols
[20:25:52] <cannap> wait
[20:25:55] <nikio_> but not spaces and other stuff
[20:26:09] <cannap> @cdwSymfony_, you want just add other table at the end=?
[20:26:30] <cannap> from the td
[20:26:32] <cdwSymfony_> A table that is built ONLY with the valus from the first column.
[20:26:57] <cdwSymfony_> Yes, I am trying to create a frozen column that will stay in place when a user scrolls left/right.
[20:27:35] <cdwSymfony_> I am actually trying to build a frozen column and a frozen row.  The frozen row is already in place, the column is a lot trickier.
[20:28:12] <cdwSymfony_> sorry project I am working on that I cannot share the layout that I am building.
[20:36:04] <cdwSymfony_> @canonp Figured it out finally https://jsfiddle.net/so0dxskg/4/
[20:36:07] <cannap> https://jsfiddle.net/so0dxskg/5/ so ?
[20:36:13] <cdwSymfony_> Not as neat and tidy as I would like.
[20:37:58] <cdwSymfony_> That is actually closer to what I awas looking for... So instead of using the wrap, take the html from the tds.  I can live with that.
[20:38:04] <cannap> https://jsfiddle.net/so0dxskg/6/
[20:38:26] <cannap> not sure which one is faster
