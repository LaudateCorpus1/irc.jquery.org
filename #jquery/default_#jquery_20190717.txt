[04:56:05] <sixfingeredamish> Hi everyone
[05:00:23] <sixfingeredamish> I'm using Jquery to read html data attributes to display photos, text, etc.
[05:08:05] <sixfingeredamish> This works fine (working example: https://mejai.netlify.com/projects)
[05:08:37] <sixfingeredamish> However, on another page, I have the exact same set-up except with search, but it won't work (https://mejai.netlify.com/search)
[05:08:49] <sixfingeredamish> I wonder if this is related to document.ready?
[05:08:58] <sixfingeredamish> All related code here: https://codeshare.io/5QLekQ
[05:59:59] <Cork> sixfingeredamish: firstly, never put scripts below body
[06:00:09] <Cork> scripts should be at the very end of body or in head
[06:00:27] <Cork> and if you put it inside body you should skip the .ready call
[06:02:22] <sixfingeredamish> I see
[06:02:29] <sixfingeredamish> Let me try to fix that
[06:03:19] <sixfingeredamish> Oh, are you talking about the codeshare link?
[06:04:06] <Cork> i'm talking about https://mejai.netlify.com/search
[06:04:53] <sixfingeredamish> I've just tried moving script inside body. This doesnt seem to solve the problem
[06:05:10] <Cork> it wasn't one or the other, it was multiple errors
[06:06:19] <sixfingeredamish> Oh no
[06:07:52] <Cork> so if you use .ready you should have the script in head
[06:08:07] <Cork> or it should be at the end of body, with no .ready wrapper
[06:08:39] <Cork> (the ready wrapper isn't needed as the elements will exist in body as it is parsed by then)
[06:08:50] <sixfingeredamish> Currently, I trying with no .ready at the end of body.
[06:09:03] <sixfingeredamish> Still doesn't seem to work hmmm
[06:10:25] <sixfingeredamish> The only difference between the 2 pages is that on the projects page, everything is pre-populated. Whereas on the search page, they are added afterwards. Would this have an effect on the Jquery hover stuff?
[11:49:25] <z1haze> if I am using $.ajaxSetup({ data: { csrf_token: $('[name=csrf_token]').val(); } }); will this query the dom for that value for each ajax reqest or only the one time?
[11:50:33] <robertmaxrees> only once.
[11:50:42] <z1haze> shoot
[11:51:21] <z1haze> other question -- is there a way i can query the dom for the ajax setup to verify the data that is been setup?
[11:51:38] <z1haze> im not getting the field added like i expected
[11:51:51] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[11:51:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:52:08] <robertmaxrees> why not just set it in the ajax calls directly?
[11:52:12] <robertmaxrees> two birds w/ one stone.
[11:52:35] <z1haze> because there's a ton of them
[11:52:58] <robertmaxrees> make a function to handle that part for you.
[11:53:10] <z1haze> but then youd still need to call that function in every ajax request
[11:53:18] <z1haze> why would you recommend against the setup?
[11:53:19] <robertmaxrees> i mean abstract out the ajax calls entirely.
[11:53:23] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:53:23] <z1haze> ah
[11:53:35] <robertmaxrees> > has bug caused by ajaxsetup
[11:53:43] <robertmaxrees> > questions why doing it a different way would be better
[11:53:44] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[11:53:51] <z1haze> ..
[11:54:02] <z1haze> its caused likely by me making a mistake
[11:54:29] <robertmaxrees> the issue is that you're trying to do something with ajaxsetup that it's not really meant to do :)  just abstract out your ajax calls and modularize things.
[11:56:15] <z1haze> ok, well that was what i was hoping to understand more. what is it supposed to be used for, if theyt give you access to the data object
[11:56:43] <robertmaxrees> it gives you access to everything.
[11:57:17] <robertmaxrees> for what it's worth, even the docs say you shouldn't use it: https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/ -> "Description: Set default values for future Ajax requests. Its use is not recommended."
[11:58:17] <z1haze> ah, ok
[11:58:27] <z1haze> so using ajaxSetup entire is not recommended?
[11:58:41] <robertmaxrees> ...
[11:58:53] <z1haze> that's what im reading on this page
[11:58:54] <robertmaxrees> the api page itself literally says "Its use is not recommended."
[11:58:58] <z1haze> yep
[11:59:04] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:22:14] <z1haze> hey robertmaxrees, been working on this function that wraps all my async calls.. but having trouble with a clone() and appendTo.. nothing seems the debugger doesnt append the data https://bpaste.net/show/6yX-
[14:22:18] <z1haze> can you take a peak?
[14:22:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:23:22] <z1haze> ok, nevermind
[14:23:39] <robertmaxrees> erm
[14:23:52] <robertmaxrees>  "nothing seems the debugger doesnt append the data" is where you lost me
[14:24:17] <z1haze> ok, my assumption is that line 14 will add an element to $form
[14:24:26] <z1haze> that is not happening in the debugger when watching $form
[14:24:44] <z1haze> assuming line 14 executes, which it does.
[14:24:55] <robertmaxrees> how are you watching that via the debugger?
[14:25:05] <z1haze> putting $form in the 'watch'
[14:25:18] <robertmaxrees> that may or may not actually do what you expect heh
[14:25:37] <z1haze> i guess not, but either way the request fails
[14:25:44] <robertmaxrees> so back up.
[14:25:47] <z1haze> its adding multiple csrf_tokens to elements onthe page too
[14:25:51] <z1haze> sure
[14:26:23] <robertmaxrees> putting a var in the watch of a debugger won't necessarily watch for, say, appends to a DOM node afaik
[14:26:54] <z1haze> wouldnt $form.serialize() take the updated field though?
[14:26:59] <robertmaxrees> i'd do a console.log($form.find('[name=csrf_token]')); there.
[14:27:08] <z1haze> ok
[14:27:10] <robertmaxrees> that should,m but I'd have to see this in action.
[14:28:19] <robertmaxrees> also
[14:28:43] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm was confused by some of your code formatting.
[14:28:44] <robertmaxrees> nbm
[14:28:46] <robertmaxrees> *nvm
[14:29:12] <z1haze> i hate how nested it is, but struggled to avoid duplication otherwise
[14:29:46] <robertmaxrees> the juggling of $form between being either an object or a jquery object is a big part of that :)
[14:30:02] <z1haze> yeah
[14:30:15] <z1haze> need to be able to call this and just send a javascript object as data though
[14:30:23] <z1haze> ok so i logged in
[14:30:34] <z1haze> its not what i expected.. its a object of 7 length
[14:30:42] <robertmaxrees> what is?
[14:30:50] <z1haze> with 7 csrf_fields
[14:31:05] <z1haze> ill be back, gonna see what's up
[14:31:08] <robertmaxrees> i thought you were looking at csrf_token?
[14:31:09] <robertmaxrees> 'k..
[14:35:01] <z1haze> i think i see what's up
[14:35:19] <z1haze> earlier i am doing a $('[type!=checkbox]', $form) which turns my form of length 1 into a jquery collection
[14:35:30] <z1haze> what i really want to do is filter out checkboxes
[14:35:37] <z1haze> can i do that and still have a single jquery object?
[14:35:52] <robertmaxrees> "filter out" as in remove the checkboxes from the jquery collection?
[14:36:01] <z1haze> yeah, but not from the dom
[14:36:07] <z1haze> the reason is because this:
[14:36:25] <robertmaxrees> $form = $form.filter('[type=checkbox]');
[14:36:27] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:36:39] <z1haze> right but that doesnt be a single jquery object anymore
[14:36:43] <z1haze> right?
[14:36:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:36:57] <z1haze> hm
[14:36:57] <z1haze> ok
[14:37:03] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[14:37:15] <z1haze> $form needs to be literally a <form> object wrapped in jquery. so the jquery object will have a length of 1
[14:37:22] <robertmaxrees> oh
[14:37:26] <z1haze> if i do filter, its going to convert $form into a bunch of elements
[14:37:31] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:37:36] <robertmaxrees> you're mixing concepts up.
[14:37:40] <z1haze> ok
[14:37:40] <robertmaxrees> that filter won't do anything heh
[14:37:52] <z1haze> well, my current example does that
[14:37:54] <z1haze> $('[type!=checkbox]', $form)
[14:37:57] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:38:03] <z1haze> im looking at it now..
[14:38:08] <robertmaxrees> that's giving you a collection of all child nodes that aren't that type.
[14:38:10] <z1haze> at gives me a jquery collection, yeah
[14:38:12] <robertmaxrees> not a single form element.
[14:38:12] <z1haze> that's not what i want
[14:38:15] <z1haze> exactly
[14:38:23] <z1haze> i want the single form element but no checkboxes
[14:38:25] <robertmaxrees> you can't have a jquery object that's tied to the DOM still but exclude some particular child nodes.
[14:38:35] <z1haze> dang
[14:38:39] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to clone the form, then remove those children from that clone.
[14:38:40] <robertmaxrees> BUT
[14:38:43] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing that?
[14:38:54] <robertmaxrees> why not just filter out the checkboxes later when you're trying to consume it?
[14:39:34] <z1haze> backend behaviors with checkboxes, it expects true/false, verses on/undefined
[14:39:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:40:02] <z1haze> normal html checkboxes. when sent in a form, they pass 'on'
[14:40:18] <z1haze> if unchecked, that dont get any value passed
[14:40:22] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to swap out the checkbox values to be something different?
[14:40:24] <z1haze> out backend expects 'true' and 'false'
[14:40:29] <z1haze> im already doing that
[14:40:38] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to fix your backend imo :)
[14:40:40] <z1haze> im adding hidden inputs, then removing them when done
[14:40:44] <z1haze> well, salesforce.. cant do
[14:40:56] <robertmaxrees> iirc you can but it's been a while.
[14:40:58] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[14:41:12] <z1haze> i didnt know you worked on commerce cloud
[14:41:22] <robertmaxrees> wait are you submitting this stuff via ajax?
[14:41:26] <z1haze> yes
[14:41:57] <robertmaxrees> in that case, build your own serializer and fix this issue in there.
[14:42:09] <robertmaxrees> instead of trying to modify the dom.  transform data, not the page :)
[14:44:54] <z1haze> heh
[14:44:59] <z1haze> what even is the logic to serialize a jquery object
[14:47:23] <z1haze> well this ought to be fun
[14:51:37] <z1haze> https://jsfiddle.net/z1haze/7jyne8hu/1/ something like this seem ok? at least for starters.. still gotta do the checkbox stuff but is this basically what happens?
[14:51:58] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec.  busy
[14:52:04] <z1haze> ok, im wrong anyway
[14:53:04] <z1haze> actuallyi think i am right console.log($form.find('[name=csrf_token]')); the data just needed input
[14:53:53] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you want .prop not .attr :)
[14:55:13] <z1haze> https://jsfiddle.net/z1haze/7jyne8hu/3/ this should do checkboxes
[14:55:25] <robertmaxrees> swap attr for prop
[14:55:26] <z1haze> and sure. what's attr for
[14:55:36] <robertmaxrees> prop reads the DOM property.
[14:55:41] <z1haze> ah cool
[14:55:54] <z1haze> https://jsfiddle.net/z1haze/7jyne8hu/4/ i think this does it? that wasn't too bad
[14:55:55] <robertmaxrees> attr reads the markup attribute, which won't reflect the actual state.
[14:56:19] <robertmaxrees> even better.
[14:56:25] <z1haze> any tips on this one?
[14:56:27] <robertmaxrees> although you could use .map() here.
[14:56:46] <z1haze> can you map a jquery collection? i alwys forget what you can/cant do
[14:56:50] <z1haze> like i know you can't do .some()
[14:57:08] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/map/ :)
[14:57:47] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kutewh0p/2/
[14:57:51] <z1haze> is there a .join() then?
[14:58:01] <z1haze> ah
[14:58:02] <z1haze> .get()
[14:58:05] <z1haze> ok that's what i missed
[14:58:15] <robertmaxrees> the .get() converts it to a normal array, like the docs point out.
[14:58:17] <z1haze> darn, i had it all but the .get() exactly the same
[14:58:27] <robertmaxrees> "As the return value is a jQuery object, which contains an array, it's very common to call .get() on the result to work with a basic array."
[14:58:47] <z1haze> neat.
[14:58:53] <robertmaxrees> are you planning on doing anything else with this serialize?
[14:59:03] <robertmaxrees> beyond sending it via ajax
[15:02:13] <z1haze> good for object? https://jsfiddle.net/z1haze/ewv7xsk6/
[15:02:19] <z1haze> no
[15:02:22] <z1haze> not at this time anyway
[15:02:30] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[15:02:59] <robertmaxrees> that works....
[15:03:10] <robertmaxrees> the new function, I mean.
[15:03:10] <z1haze> you always have these cryptic ....
[15:03:19] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:03:28] <robertmaxrees> i get confused when people are vague about what they're asking.
[15:03:47] <z1haze> well i mean we were on the topic of serializing objects for ajax calls, werent we?
[15:03:58] <robertmaxrees> what are you asking, specifically?
[15:04:02] <z1haze> you gave me a suggestion on the jquery one, so i thought youd do that same for this one
[15:04:06] <robertmaxrees> the fiddle you just linked functions as I would expect.
[15:04:19] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean style wise?
[15:04:31] <z1haze> yeah, code review, whatever
[15:04:41] <robertmaxrees> aaaaaaaaaah and the "no" and "not at this time anyway" were in response to my "are you planning" question?
[15:04:43] <z1haze> just asking for your experienced jquery opinion
[15:04:48] <robertmaxrees> *javascript ;)
[15:04:52] <z1haze> correct
[15:04:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i got real lost there.
[15:05:11] <z1haze> let's just call it good then
[15:05:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's what I'd do.
[15:05:13] <z1haze> thank you
[15:05:18] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:05:19] <robertmaxrees> 'k
[15:05:24] <z1haze> i appreciate it
