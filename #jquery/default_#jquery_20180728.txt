[02:28:51] <Sangeet> can anyone suggest me 10-15 programs which everyone should do after getting basic/intermediate knowledge of Jquery?
[04:39:39] <W0LF> I'm trying to stop PACE.js from firing on my autocomplete search bar here - kobejet.com - I'm trying the ajax: false, etc. rules from https://github.hubspot.com/pace/, but none seem to do the trick
[04:42:35] <Woet> W0LF: and what is your jQuery question?
[05:15:28] <W0LF> Woet: I don't understand why I had to change/hack the pace.min.js file directly to get the "restartOnRequestAfter: false" command to work. I made a drupal-friendly js file to do it, and tested it with an alert (which worked), but the settings didn't work
[05:25:00] <Woet> W0LF: still not seeing any jQuery relevance

[06:46:23] <pavonia> If the server doesn't allow that, you have to use your own server as a proxy
[09:05:53] <momomo> $().first() exists ... but is there a $().nth(n) as well?
[09:17:51] <pavonia> momomo: .eq(n)

[21:32:56] <how2hack> does ajax .done() wait for the request to finish, right?
[21:33:58] <how2hack> if so then i can't figure out why sometimes when i refresh the page, some code at the end does not get executed... i put a console.log() and i cannot see it in the console
[21:34:17] <how2hack> has this ever happened to anyone?
[23:11:11] <neo4> pavonia: ;)
[23:20:48] <how2hack> is $.each() synchronous right?
[23:23:45] <how2hack> sometimes (on page refresh) ajax .done() skips code after $.each(), is that normal?
