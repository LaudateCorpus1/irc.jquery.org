[17:07:26] <errorous> Hello. A WP website I'm working on is using jq 1.12.4. Now, I'm trying to unbind() input event from #toolset-maps-distance-center , but no luck. neither in the code nor from console
[17:07:32] <errorous> https://sandbox.realty360view.com/
[17:07:36] <errorous> any ideas why?
[17:08:42] <errorous> tried jQuery('#toolset-maps-distance-center').unbind( 'input' ); both in console and in code near the </body>, but no go. Also tried the very same selector that's being used to attach event to said element, still no luck
[18:13:42] <shoky_> errorous: maybe the event listener was not added with jquery
[18:14:04] <shoky_> errorous: in this case, seems it was added by google maps autocomplete lib
[18:14:19] <errorous> shoky_`it's not. it looks like vanilla js addEventListener
[18:14:35] <shoky_> errorous: nope
[18:14:38] <errorous> shoky_how can I remove it?
[18:14:47] <errorous> I just wanna disable autocomplete
[18:14:51] <shoky_> i mean, google maps is proabbly using a vanilla js listener, yes
[18:14:55] <errorous> autosuggestion, whatever it's called
[18:16:43] <shoky_> umm
[18:16:54] <shoky_> jQuery('#toolset-maps-distance-center').replaceWith( jQuery('#toolset-maps-distance-center').clone(false) )      could work ;p
