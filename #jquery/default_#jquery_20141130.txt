[02:58:29] <SixDev> Do anybody know whay I have to do implement jquery in my commercial site?
[03:40:11] <MatixYo> Hi
[03:44:43] <MatixYo> I wonder, does jquery .on() prefix events like visibilitychange?
[03:48:12] <MatixYo> And if so, then does it bind events with all vendors or it chooses the right one?
[03:48:47] <MatixYo> And if so, then does it bind events with all vendors or it chooses the right one?
[03:50:55] <MatixYo> Anyone?
[03:55:51] <MatixYo> Or do you need a plugin for that?
[06:33:47] <Ayub> I am trying to post jquery ajax form, none of my call backs are being invoked
[06:33:54] <Ayub> could some one assist me ?
[06:34:42] <Woet> Ayub: make it reproducible on www.jsfiddle.net
[06:36:14] <Ayub> Woet: I am submitting it to localhost, not sure if I can do that in www.jsfiddle.net below is my pastebin
[06:36:17] <Ayub> woet:http://pastebin.com/7js53Wtw
[06:36:59] <Ayub> Woet: submit works..only thing is the response gets downloaded..
[06:45:34] <Ayub> Woet: with chrome it works
[06:50:43] <Ayub> Woet:could you please check this http://jsfiddle.net/sz6k9fa4/1/
[06:52:10] <Woet> Ayub: please make it reproducible.
[06:52:51] <Ayub> Woet: I created the jsfiddle..it works in chrome but not in ie
[06:53:03] <Woet> your jsfiddle doesn't work in any browser.
[06:54:41] <Ayub> Woet: let me check
[07:06:39] <Ayub> Woet: you could try this http://jsfiddle.net/sz6k9fa4/9/
[07:09:17] <Woet> Ayub: so processJson is not being called? for which browsers?
[07:09:25] <Woet> if it's IE, what does their debugger say?
[07:09:33] <Ayub> let me check it
[07:09:46] <Ayub> In IE I see that the response is being downloaded
[07:09:50] <Ayub> like a file
[07:11:48] <Woet> probably because of a JS error.
[07:13:33] <Ayub> Woet: console does not have any errors though..let me verify again
[07:17:16] <Ayub> Woet: no console error or js error
[07:17:22] <Ayub> not sure what might be the issue
[07:18:09] <Woet> i don't have IE so I can't test it for you
[07:18:18] <Woet> does complete() fire?
[07:20:02] <Ayub> Woet: let me check it out
[07:21:42] <Ayub> Woet: no it does not get fired
[07:24:06] <Ayub> Woet: thank you for looking in to my issue
[07:24:13] <Ayub> I will try to debug it later..
[09:52:33] <giuseppesolinas> hello
[09:52:58] <giuseppesolinas> how can I fire an event when an input type=file is done with the upload?
[09:54:33] <giuseppesolinas> is there any plug-in that handles multiple file uploads? (for example a gallery) with image preview, replacenent and deletion?
[09:54:37] <giuseppesolinas> thanks in advance
[09:56:06] <systemfault> How is a input type=file even related to the actual process or uploading?
[09:56:14] <systemfault> Uploading is done when a form is sent.. or by using "ajax"
[10:00:04] <giuseppesolinas> systemfault, some show progress, I can listen fot input change on an input text, l mean to fire an action when the input has done loading the image
[10:00:36] <systemfault> giuseppesolinas: Could you write an example on jsfiddle.net or something?
[10:31:12] <nathaneltitane> hey :)
[10:31:44] <nathaneltitane> question: how do i force html hrefs with a _blank target to open with the use of jquery?
[11:50:36] <reynierpm> hi shoky and good afternoon see I continue working on the script you made and I change take a look here http://jsbin.com/ruxidaxuxu/1/edit?js,output the problem is that arr4 is not equal than arr1, arr2 and others so for that reason the code with arr4 fails and I need a workaround here, the only solution I found was check on { ids[obj.pais.id] = obj; } for obj.pais if not present like in arr4 then transform it to { ids[obj.id] = obj; } but I do not kn
[12:20:49] <doug64k> giuseppesolinas: inputs don't load images do they?
[12:20:55] <CssN00b> Is there such thing as a javascript developer and a jquery developer?
[12:21:05] <doug64k> CssN00b: yes
[12:21:37] <CssN00b> hmm
[12:21:48] <doug64k> the first might write js code that runs in places other than browsers. a jquery developer would know how to create jquery plugins (for example)
[12:23:35] <doug64k> there is some overlap where they use different tools as well. jquery's deferred is not the same as the promises that a javascript dev might use
[12:59:31] <tocka> hi guys.. just wanted your opinion, if anyone of you has worked with google maps. What library would you suggest using?
[13:00:31] <tocka> Websites functionality would be something like http://bit.ly/1tBU2R6
[13:39:21] <d0de> is there a way I can represent numbers as high as 2^128 as integers and do arithmetic on them without losing accuracy?
[13:59:39] <mikesm> Hello, I have a problem with this sortable list: http://jsfiddle.net/p6jv2e8q/
[13:59:50] <mikesm> It is not possible to drag the first item to the bottom
[14:01:22] <mikesm> I believe jquery sortable waits until the cursor holding the sortable div is at least half way past any other sortable div before it reverses the order of the 2 divs in the DOM
[14:02:31] <mikesm> Is there a way to make it so that it will switch the order of the 2 divs when a certain percentage of the div being dragged crosses another div, rather than basing it off of the cursor position?
[14:03:57] <mikesm> http://jsfiddle.net/p6jv2e8q/1/
[14:07:12] <mikesm> http://jsfiddle.net/p6jv2e8q/4/
[14:09:39] <Duvdevan> where's shoky?
[14:36:20] <darrenlooby> http://jsfiddle.net/po6v6r1p/
[14:36:27] <darrenlooby> Can anyone help me?
[14:37:19] <giuseppesolinas> darrenlooby, what's wrong?
[14:38:41] <darrenlooby> I've added a quick note on the fiddle, but basically - I'm struggling at trying to find the index of an element relative to the body
[14:43:52] <kevireilly_> darrenlooby: a simple approach would be adding a property to each item that indicates your intended index such as data-index and .data(‘index’)
[14:44:41] <darrenlooby> I was thinking as much, but I did wonder if there is a way I can just traverse it correctly... if that's even possible.
[14:45:58] <kevireilly_> darrenlooby: quick example http://jsfiddle.net/po6v6r1p/4/
[14:47:20] <sammych1> as long as the list is static
[14:47:28] <kevireilly_> true
[14:48:31] <kevireilly_> could turn the index determination into a function called when new items are added/removed, but surely there is a better way
[14:49:18] <sammych1> if you have the data source, just query that instead?
[14:49:19] <riccardo_> hi
[14:49:22] <darrenlooby> The list will be static for now, but I don't want to tie myself in.
[14:50:35] <darrenlooby> Nope. No data source. It's all written in HTML. It's all lazy written by people with no access to or skillset with jquery or javascript generally
[14:52:05] <riccardo_> why when I do the target.remove() it doesn't delete the html of the target ? (that is the link that I click)
[14:52:06] <riccardo_> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/cd0757724cc6a2e4e6bf
[14:52:13] <marcusmoore> Hello. I'm having trouble with a potentially dumb problem. Do sortable lists have to have a number? I have two lists connected and I want to be able to submit the items that are dragged from one side to the other. I don't care about the order, just id values. Any thoughts?
[14:52:26] <marcusmoore> I am using the serialize method.
[14:54:05] <kevireilly_> darrenlooby: http://jsfiddle.net/po6v6r1p/5/
[14:54:38] <kevireilly_> darrenlooby: is determined based on all .item’s at time of click
[14:58:39] <darrenlooby> kevireilly, THANKS!
[14:58:51] <kevireilly_> no problem
[14:58:59] <darrenlooby> I've been pissing around for ages. So simple! :D
[14:59:40] <kevireilly_> haha yeah I forgot you could provide a selector to the index method, reviewed the documentation real quick
[15:03:21] <decx> isnt that another lookup?
[15:06:00] <kevireilly_> prolly
[15:07:02] <decx> normally you cache that items collection
[15:07:10] <decx> so you can do items.index(this) too
[15:07:32] <kevireilly_> yeah that makes sense, guess the focal point on the last example was evaluation at click time for dynamic content
[15:07:51] <decx> good point
[15:08:38] <kevireilly_> but a similar concept could be implemented to cache it when the content changes
[15:39:45] <kingfisher64> can anybody tell me how to do a fadein after a set amount of seconds for a caption on a slideshow? I'm finding that because the slides all load in one it only works on the first piece of text as the effect is applied onload. I'm a jquery newbie. Many thanks
[15:50:28] <linagee> if I have a class selector $(".myClass") and then do a .next() on it, what happens if more than one thing in the DOM tree has that class?
[15:50:29] <kwizzles> how can i let animate set display to none, instead of display to block (i do animation of position and opacity), callback functinos seem not to work, eg $(this).animate({ opacity: 0, top: "+=400px", always: function() {console.log('anim complete');}, 200);
[15:50:44] <kwizzles> nothing in console
[15:54:35] <linagee> ah. n/m. instead of being an array of matches to that selector, it will be an array of the next match on each of those.... (this is probably a way simple concept. :) )
[15:58:22] <kwizzles> why don't i get the alert here? http://jsfiddle.net/pn7vwb0x/1/
[16:02:39] <afmza> why on earth would my $.put stop working/not recognised?
[16:03:35] <afmza> nvm i was missing the jquery extension
[17:34:40] <Sherafff> what's the equivalent of list($var1, $var2) = myfunc(); in javascript?
[17:51:07] <afroradiohead> what does list($var1, $var2) = myfunction() do in php?
[17:57:13] <systemfault> array destructuring
[18:02:03] <reynierpm> how do I check if a element exist in a array and if not push it to the array?
[18:04:24] <systemfault> You would use .indexOf, if it returns -1 then it means that the element was not in the array
[18:05:48] <reynierpm> so something like this selectedIdsSelFab.indexOf(searchValue) === -1 will work?
[18:06:09] <systemfault> Yup, if it returns -1 then push it in the array
[18:06:17] <reynierpm> ok thanks
[18:54:56] <cjohnson> Sherafff: there's this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment
[18:55:15] <cjohnson> very little support yet tho
[19:02:20] <Larado> can some1 tell me why the typeahead search results appear if you move the mouse it dissapears http://bit.ly/1tG4JnV
[19:12:01] <Onionnion> If I get an array of jQuery objects by doing something like 'var foo = $("form input")' and I iterate through it by doing for(var i=0; i<=foo.length; i++), why does foo[i].addClass() report as undefined if the input has no value?
[19:14:09] <systemfault> Your code doesn't make sense. A pure DOM node doesn't have .addClass
[19:14:39] <systemfault> And seriously, NOBODY using jQuery iterates on node using a dumb for statement
[19:16:19] <Oka> Onionnion: $.each http://jsfiddle.net/Oka/298z896z/
[19:18:01] <Oka> Actually, http://jsfiddle.net/Oka/298z896z/1/ for both syntax styles
[19:20:22] <Onionnion> aha, got it, thanks, sorry
[19:22:15] <Bryzzle> Anyone able to get the javascript command window in Sublime text 2 for Mac users to appear and work properly?
[19:22:47] <Bryzzle> I am trying to create a build that will execute my javascript codes
[19:40:28] <BillCriswell> Bryzzle: Like Tools > Build System > New Build System?
[19:40:36] <Bryzzle> Yes
[19:40:55] <BillCriswell> So that's the answer you were looking for?
[19:50:18] <BillCriswell> Ok
[20:16:48] <Bryzzle> @BillCrisWell you there?
[20:17:33] <Bryzzle> I actually was looking for the code to create a new build system I can use for javascript code.
[20:22:05] <BillCriswell> Bryzzle: Not sure I'm following.
[20:22:52] <BillCriswell> Like gulp or grunt?
[20:22:58] <Bryzzle> Bill
[20:23:34] <Bryzzle> I may be asking a useless question. With that being said, I am unfamiliar with Sublime Text 2.
[20:23:51] <Bryzzle> Is there already a way to run javascript code naturally in Sublime text 2?
[20:24:06] <Bryzzle> Or one must created a javascript build?
[20:24:22] <Bryzzle> @BillCriswell
[20:24:48] <BillCriswell> Bryzzle: What kind of javascript?
[20:25:04] <Bryzzle> I just want to run the most basic.
[20:25:08] <Bryzzle> Console.log(“hello world”);
[20:25:47] <BillCriswell> and where would you want that to output?
[20:27:16] <Bryzzle> In Sublime text.
[20:27:32] <Bryzzle> @BillCriswell , I want to be able to see the console in sublime text 2.
[20:32:35] <BillCriswell> Bryzzle: The console in sublime text is python. To use javascript I'd have to google around.
[20:33:12] <robertmaxrees> the console is more for making plugins and shit, isn't it?
[20:33:21] <robertmaxrees> like, not really for an REPL?
[20:33:26] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[20:34:00] <Bryzzle> Oh
[20:34:17] <BillCriswell> Bryzzle: http://calebgrove.com/articles/js-console-sublime-text could be useful to do what you want, but not sure why you want to do that.
[20:38:29] <BillCriswell> I just got it set up with node if you're curious.
[20:39:09] <BillCriswell> I guess that could be useful for a scratch.
[20:46:42] <robertmaxrees> how goes BillCriswell?
[20:47:26] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: It's good, put a bunch of those sticky christmas decals on my girlfriends dad's windows tonight and that was oddly therapeutic.
[20:48:23] <robertmaxrees> well that's neat.
[20:49:17] <BillCriswell> Yeah. I came up with some clever ways to get them on easier since I feel the need to do that for everything.
[20:49:34] <robertmaxrees> you're a programmer - it's in your nature.
[20:50:08] <BillCriswell> by the time I found a quality approach I was all out of decals.
[20:52:14] <robertmaxrees> sounds about right.
[20:54:43] <BillCriswell> Packing my lunch all week next week.
[20:54:50] <BillCriswell> BIG BOY TIME
[20:54:54] <robertmaxrees> ballin'.
[20:55:02] <robertmaxrees> what's on the menu.
[20:55:33] <BillCriswell> Turkey and Cheese / PB&J / Chicken
[20:58:24] <robertmaxrees> shit.  eating better than i am.
[21:10:04] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Haha
[22:34:54] <GoSox> So can I have something like an onkeyup event handler, that tells it's parent form to submit, then have a submit event handler that handles that submit?
[22:35:13] <GoSox> this would be part of a search-as-you-type search box
[22:36:13] <cjohnson> you could do that. $this.closest('form').trigger('submit') or so
[22:36:44] <GoSox> but i mean... it will work? i pretty much know how to code it, i just want to make sure there's not some piece of the puzzle i'm missing, that will cause it to not work
[22:37:10] <cjohnson> .trigger('submit') will trigger a submit on the given node if that's what you're asking
[22:37:25] <cjohnson> including any event handler you have bound to that event
[22:37:59] <GoSox> i know MAC address search tools aren't particularly sexy. But as far as those tools go, this is definitely going to be the sexist one of the bunch :P
[22:51:35] <root3d> i am trying out this very cheap templating trick ... but template isn't visible on html , do i need to append or embed html https://gist.github.com/igauravsehrawat/03be3636dc21d1c195a7 ?
[23:03:34] <GoSox> so whats the best event to use on a text input, if I want to fire event on every keystroke when typing in the box, or if info is pasted into the box, via keystroke shortcut or using the edit menu (no keystrokes at all) ?
[23:08:23] <jop008> Anyone a good language selector for jquery mobile? Country + flag would be great
[23:08:38] <jop008> I googled but no good results
[23:15:51] <GoSox> .change( ) only fires when a text box is de-selected, is there a better event to use that doesn't wait?
[23:16:11] <GoSox> i know i can do keyup but that won't trigger for pastes and siri-input, which i assume works just like a paste
[23:16:31] <GoSox> should i just do two different triggers, a change and a keyup?
[23:16:36] <GoSox> or is there a better single event to use?
[23:21:49] <Jattenalle> GoSox, you bind keyup and change, there's no other way to do it
[23:21:55] <GoSox> ok
[23:22:11] <Jattenalle> to catch paste/autofill you'd need to just check it
[23:22:18] <Jattenalle> in an interval or somesuch
[23:22:24] <GoSox> .change() doesn't catch a paste?
[23:22:29] <Jattenalle> it does not
[23:22:32] <GoSox> hm
[23:22:35] <GoSox> bummer
[23:22:44] <GoSox> oh right, because you haven't deselected
[23:22:56] <Jattenalle> but there's .on('change paste keyup'), function(){  });
[23:23:10] <Jattenalle> still wont catch all weirdness though
[23:24:02] <Jattenalle> GoSox, you can also try .on('input', ...
[23:24:08] <GoSox> wait so, what WILL a .change() catch, that a .keyup() won't, when we're talking about a simple text input?
[23:24:10] <Jattenalle> not sure how supported that is on handhelds though
[23:24:30] <Jattenalle> .change only triggers when a textbox loses focus, not while typing
[23:24:37] <Jattenalle> .keyp triggers while typing as well
[23:24:43] <Jattenalle> keyup*
[23:24:51] <Uhkis> keyup doesn't handle repeated keys
[23:25:11] <GoSox> right, so i can't think of a case where a .change() will catch input that .keyup() has not
[23:25:20] <Jattenalle> Uhkis, it will as soon as you let go of the key
[23:25:45] <GoSox> 'input' seems to work well, ill have to test it on more browsers to see if it has issues
[23:26:04] <Jattenalle> GoSox, yeah input is the new way to do it, but browser support
[23:26:13] <Jattenalle> especially on handhelds, is "bad"
[23:26:14] <Jattenalle> :P
[23:26:18] <Uhkis> Jattenalle: yes, but then you can be hundreds of keys behind :P
[23:26:36] <GoSox> well handhelds aren't an issue for me tonight, it just has to work very well on desktops
[23:27:07] <Jattenalle> Uhkis, no no, we dont care about the value of the keyup event.. since it's run on a textbox.. you just check the textbox content, the value of the event is irrelevant in this case.. so even if keyup only triggers once after you've held down "aaaaaaaaaaa" the textbox will hold the correct data, and that's what you'd use
[23:27:14] <GoSox> for handhelds, ill probably use a more traditional search box anyway, one where you enter data and submit,r ather than search as you type, since you generally won't see the search results anyway
[23:27:16] <Jattenalle> Uhkis, so yeah, doesnt matter 90% of the time
