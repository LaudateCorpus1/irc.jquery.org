[00:00:02] <Clorith> I'm thinking a .each() and then an if check should suffice, didn't spot any other methods
[00:00:12] <Cork> $(td).find('input, textarea').val()
[00:00:28] <Clorith> Do you use .val() with textareas though?
[00:00:34] <Cork> yes
[00:00:44] <Cork> .val is not the same as .value
[00:00:44] <b-ot> Cork, memorised “val”.
[00:00:48] <Clorith> awesome, saves me a lot of time :D
[00:00:59] <Cork> its a smart function for form elements
[00:01:18] <Cork> b-ot: forget val
[00:01:18] <b-ot> Cork, I have forgotten “val”.
[00:01:21] <Cork> ...
[00:19:19] <May> Hi! Does anyone have an advice on how to properly store a number of positive integers (what kind of data structure) and how to encode them into a string which a user can save/paste to "load" some settings?
[00:20:13] <systemfault> A javascript object and JSON.stringify
[00:21:00] <May> Oki Doki. JSON.stringify is part of jQuery or do i need another lib for that?
[00:21:12] <systemfault> It's part of all recent browsers...
[00:21:23] <systemfault> For IE7 and lower, you will need json2.js
[00:22:11] <May> Ah OK. Thanks a lot! :)
[00:24:10] <kzrdt> hi
[00:24:45] <kzrdt> is this ' $(this).next(".showrome") ' correct?
[00:24:57] <kzrdt> I don't succeed to make it work
[00:25:17] <majd> Hey #jquery - what's the difference between $("select").append("<option val='1'>option 1</option>") and  $("select").append($("<option val='1'>option 1</option>"))    ??? which is better?
[00:26:02] <systemfault> The first one.. the second one makes a useless call
[00:27:29] <majd> systemfault: a colleague insists that it should be the second one, since that way you're manipulatnig an object within an object...
[00:27:56] <May> kzrdt i guess that depends on your case? That one would try to select the following element which has the class "showrome".
[00:28:05] <May> If i'm not mistaken.
[00:28:35] <systemfault> majd: Your colleague is wrong… There's no advantage to do it that way.
[00:29:13] <majd> systemfault: good to know! thanks.
[00:29:32] <tw2113> don't forget to tell your colleague off about it
[00:29:44] <tw2113> remember "some guy on the internet said you're wrong, there's no benefit"
[00:30:12] <systemfault> Haha
[00:31:05] <tw2113> say it with a serious voice, so they know you mean business
[00:34:02] <majd> lol, he'll appreciate it, i'm sure
[00:34:50] <dogarrhea2>  data: { name: "John", location: "Boston" } })  inside an ajax call.  If the request is GET, can i interpret this to be similar to ?name=John&location=Boston ???
[00:35:18] <kzrdt> May: yes that's that :S
[00:36:44] <tw2113> that would be the nature of a GET request dogarrhea2
[00:37:23] <dogarrhea2> tw2113: the thing is i don't know that there's some magic going on underneath which translates name: and location: to get parameters
[00:37:49] <tw2113> key/value
[00:38:10] <dogarrhea2> since you know, name: is a javascript atribute/variable/whatever it is and "john" is a string and name=John is something else as well
[00:40:35] <tw2113> it's able to distinquish between keys and values in the request
[00:43:03] <dogarrhea2> what if i do someKey:hahaThisIsAnArrayOfObjectsTakeThat
[00:43:20] <tw2113> you'd break the internet
[00:43:26] <tw2113> aka i dunno, try it and see
[00:44:04] <blackspotwiggins> dogarrhea2, someKey[]=firstarrayelement&somekey[]=secondarrayelement
[00:44:13] <blackspotwiggins> aka an array
[00:44:23] <blackspotwiggins> your backend should parse it correctly
[00:44:26] <dogarrhea2> firstarrayelement doesn't look like an object though
[00:44:27] <blackspotwiggins> so dont worry about it
[00:47:23] <dogarrhea2> hrm. i see an attribute named prOnly. i wonder if they mean "public relations only" or something with pr0n like characteristics.
[00:47:46] <dogarrhea2> anyways. good night
[00:47:52] <dogarrhea2> time to do some other things
[01:07:15] <May> I doubt that there is a ready to use "please map each bit of that number to an option in that array"-function, is there?
[01:19:45] <hik> hi, do you know a function in jquery transform this number  1234 at 1 234 ? Thinks
[01:29:50] <shoky> ?js var n = 1234; [parseInt(n/1000), n%1000]
[01:29:56] <bot-t> shoky: [1, 234]
[01:32:45] <houman> Hi, under $(document).ready(function () {	}  I have a call like this $(".typeahead").typeahead({	
[01:32:47] <houman> 	    source: function (query, process) { ... } });     How can refactor the content into a function call, so that I have something like this at the end: $(document).ready(function () {  $(".typeahead").typeahead(myMethod) }
[01:33:37] <blackspotwiggins> houman, var myMethod = { source: asdblah }
[01:37:25] <houman> blackspotwiggins: Not as var please, as function: function myMethod() {}
[01:40:23] <blackspotwiggins> houman, then you'd have to call $(".typeahead").typeahead(myMethod())
[01:40:33] <blackspotwiggins> i dont really see the difference, you need to pass an object in there anyway
[01:46:31] <houman> blackspotwiggins: Thanks. Its hard to explain it here: Please check the paste code: http://pastebin.com/w0XFB76J  line 6 contains too much code, I would like to refactor it into a function like line 4 and line 1 respectively.  Do you know what I mean now?
[01:49:57] <shoky> houman: why not  function mySource(query, process) { ... };   then $(".typeahead").typeahead({ source: mySource })
[01:50:19] <houman> great let me try this
[01:51:07] <rahmen> Hi! Is there any way of sending an ajax-request with a new session? something like xhrFields:{withCredentials:false} ? I've tried removing the cookie also but with no success. Also tried some with the ajax headers properties.. anyone who knows how to do this?
[01:54:02] <houman> shoky: thanks a lot. It works. Much cleaner now. :)
[01:56:03] <shoky> houman: cool. remember you can always put a named function in place of an anonymous one
[01:56:38] <Eviltwin> And you can always put an expression that evalutes to an expression in the place of an anonymous function
[01:56:51] <Eviltwin> evaluates to a function*
[01:57:01] <houman> yeah, the { source : function() } confused me. :))
[02:04:24] <j0zef> hi all
[02:04:56] <j0zef> is there a way to just add plain CSS to the dom?
[02:07:09] <rahmen> j0zef: Not sure, but you can put the CSS in your css-file and add classes to the elements instead. That makes your CSS more edit friendly in the future.
[02:07:36] <j0zef> rahmen: thanks
[02:08:22] <shoky> if you really want you can $('<style> body { color: red } </style>?????????????????????????????????????????').appendTo('head');????
[02:08:29] <shoky> oops.
[02:09:06] <shoky> well.. $('<style> body { color: red } </style>').appendTo('head');
[02:09:19] <DrMabuse> hello
[02:10:07] <DrMabuse> i have an issue anyone can tell me why this not work in FF jQuery(window).resize(function () {alert('test')})
[02:16:23] <DrMabuse> no one ß
[02:16:25] <DrMabuse> ??
[02:19:26] <DrMabuse> sorry anyone can tell me how use the window resize ?
[02:19:32] <DrMabuse> event
[02:19:38] <ak> hm
[02:19:38] <DrMabuse> pls
[02:20:16] <DrMabuse> jQuery(window).resize(function(){{alert('test)}) not working
[02:20:37] <ak> $(window).resize(function() {console.log('resize triggered'); })  i think should work
[02:21:08] <Eviltwin> DrMabuse: It usually helps when curly braces and quotes are matched
[02:24:19] <DrMabuse> it will be more useful when i load the js rigt x)
[02:27:09] <xnotte> why this does not remove <div id="marcacaoTop"><a id="voltarPaciente"> ?  $("#marcacaoTop").remove("a#voltarPaciente"); ?
[02:27:21] <rich97> I have a really weird problem. I'm doing `$('#selector').click(function(e) {e.preventDefault();})` but it doesn't seem to do anything to stop the default event...
[02:34:46] <jammsen> i got a get request that returns 2 divs with seperate IDs
[02:35:06] <jammsen> is there a way to access that directly? or do i have to set a hidden div with the html data?
[02:35:14] <jammsen> and get then the content?
[02:48:39] <kurrataW_> i have form with checkbox and jabascript that should show some hiden fields if checkbox is checked. what i am/could be doing wrong that ebent isnt binded to checkbox? http://pastebin.com/HKys2cVA
[02:48:49] <Cork> ?.filter @ jammsen
[02:48:50] <bot-t> jammsen, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[02:49:41] <jammsen> ok ty
[02:49:44] <Cork> kurrataW: you should NEVER do <tag>#id
[02:49:53] <Cork> it just makes the selector slower for no reason what so ever
[02:50:03] <Cork> nothing is more specific then an id
[02:50:59] <juha_> always use #id, unless there's puppies, always use puppies
[02:51:37] <Cork> juha_: actually verry often classes is better then id's
[02:51:38] <kurrataW_> well but it still doest bind event to that checkbox for some reason
[02:51:57] <Cork> kurrataW: was about to type the rest of the answer :)
[02:52:22] <Cork> kurrataW: your prob binding the event before the html is added to the dom
[02:52:27] <Cork> so the selector doesn't match anything
[02:52:35] <juha_> Cork: puppies are even better
[02:53:01] <Cork> juha_: its really unpredictable in selectors ;P
[02:53:23] <juha_> Cork: yeah, it takes some time to house train them
[02:53:25] <Cork> the might jump, or bark or pee on the corner of the carpet
[02:53:29] <blackspotwiggins> document.getElementByPuppies
[02:53:30] <blackspotwiggins> :)
[02:53:49] <kurrataW_> Cork: i have it in $(document).ready(function(){})
[02:54:08] <Cork> kurrataW: if your adding the html though ajax it doens't matter
[02:54:23] <Cork> *doesn't
[02:58:23] <davetarmac> hey guys - I'm still having some bother with getting a script working how I need it working http://jsfiddle.net/SSQM9/
[02:58:51] <davetarmac> Currently, the text changes as needed on hover, but when I mouseOut, the text doesn't revert back to old text.
[02:58:57] <davetarmac> Anyone free to lend a hand?
[03:00:26] <BinaryKitten> davetarmac where in the code is the oldtext?
[03:01:47] <davetarmac> BinaryKitten: That's certainly what is missing - but I'm not sure how to revert it back
[03:02:23] <davetarmac> BinaryKitten: I've just changed the script so you can see what I did have (see the commented line: http://jsfiddle.net/SSQM9/1/
[03:02:51] <davetarmac> The problem is that there is a drop down (the reason for the qtip-hover class addition
[03:03:14] <Cork> davetarmac: you should be doing it with dom elements and classes instead
[03:03:19] <Cork> one min let mi show you
[03:03:23] <Cork> mi==me
[03:03:25] <davetarmac> ok Cork
[03:03:36] <davetarmac> Thanks :)
[03:04:11] <davetarmac> In that case, just so you know it is part of a ul list, and .mainmenu-advice is an <a>
[03:04:22] <Cork> davetarmac: http://jsfiddle.net/SSQM9/2/
[03:04:51] <umberleigh> i'm trying to take a string of telephone numbers, separated by newlines and turn it into a JSON string. is there a better way of doing this than exploding the string into an array, then manually constructing a JSON string?
[03:04:56] <davetarmac> hmm - might not be able to do it that way is the problem
[03:05:11] <umberleigh> haven't done anything with JSON before, so i'm a n00b at this
[03:05:13] <davetarmac> Cork: the site I'm trying to get this working on is http://allenbridge.launcharea.co.uk/
[03:05:43] <davetarmac> Cork: and if you hover over the Advice menu item, you'll probably get a better idea of what I'm trying to achieve
[03:06:54] <Cork> davetarmac: so you want to change the label of the menu when you hover a child element?
[03:07:37] <davetarmac> It will change the label when you're over itself, the child elements and then change back when mouseOut from self and child elements
[03:07:49] <Cork> if so then just make <span class="new"></span> and replace its content with the text from the child your hovering
[03:07:53] <Cork> the rest should work the same
[03:08:22] <davetarmac> it's a Drupal site, so I don't have access to change the markup sadly
[03:08:26] <Cork> ah
[03:08:31] <Cork> that makes it harder
[03:08:32] <davetarmac> which is why I'm trying to do it this way
[03:08:38] <davetarmac> yup - finding that :)
[03:08:50] <Cork> you could wrapp the content of the links with a span
[03:08:54] <Cork> and add the spans you want
[03:09:16] <Cork> only other option is to store the old context from the dom as your replacing it
[03:09:23] <rahmen> Is there any way of sending an ajax-request with a new session? something like xhrFields:{withCredentials:false} ? I've tried removing the cookie also but with no success. Also tried some with the ajax headers properties.. anyone who knows how to do this or if it's possible or not?
[03:09:51] <davetarmac> Cork: I don't understand the 2nd option yo umention
[03:10:40] <Cork> davetarmac: ex have a variable that you replace with a serialized form of whats in the link element
[03:11:04] <Cork> davetarmac: though means the browser has to reflow the dom everytime you hover the menu
[03:11:07] <Cork> and that makes it slow
[03:11:30] <Cork> (it has to reparse the content too, and thats another bad point)
[03:11:46] <davetarmac> Hmm - if there no way we can extend the script I'm mangled together to change the off state?
[03:12:17] <Cork> my suggestion was this:
[03:12:22] <Cork> keep the css
[03:12:35] <Cork> but add the extra spans from js
[03:13:20] <davetarmac> oh right, so dynamically adding the spans when the page is ready?
[03:13:40] <Cork> html('<span class="old">' + $this.html() ' +</span><span class="new"></span>');
[03:13:59] <Cork> bah a bit of typo there
[03:14:29] <davetarmac> would it be easier to do it on the fiddle so I can see it working?
[03:14:41] <Cork> sure
[03:14:45] <Aamir> anyone have any idea about alternative of window.opener in ie8?
[03:17:38] <Cork> davetarmac: http://jsfiddle.net/SSQM9/3/
[03:19:20] <davetarmac> Ahh - I see
[03:24:22] <davetarmac> Cork: added that to the site (as it seemed to work), but it doesn't
[03:24:31] <davetarmac> saying Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[03:35:16] <majd> good afternoon! What could be some reason that the minWidth and maxWidth (and height) options in my .dialog() are not working? All other options i tried work just fine...
[03:36:08] <davetarmac> Cork: figured the issue - there was a dodgy char at the end of the script. Fixed that now.
[03:36:53] <davetarmac> Cork: however, whilst the text does change back on mouseOut - it doesn't stay as the new text for the mouseover on child elements
[04:02:22] <majd> I'm loading content into a .dialog() from ajax requests. It's probable that the content of the dialog will be larger than the screen size, so i want the dialog to have a maximum width of, say, 90% of the window size
[04:02:47] <majd> i can't use maxWidth because it works on resize, and is not checked when the content changes
[04:03:00] <majd> what should i be doing to get the behaviour i wanted?
[04:05:42] <mariuscc> any clue why $(document).ready(function(){ would give ReferenceError: $ is not defined even if jquery is included at bottom of page?
[04:12:17] <ph88> try including it in the HEAD section of your html
[04:26:02] <radiodario> yeah what's this fashion of putting all the JS at the bottom?
[04:26:33] <radiodario> still it should be suficcient if you include jquery before the script where you use it
[04:26:45] <radiodario> so potentially they could both be at the end of the page
[04:35:18] <Cork> radiodario: sync vs async script loading
[04:37:13] <NexHD> hi
[04:37:30] <NexHD> how i add a count variabile?
[04:40:25] <radiodario> Cork: async isn't supported everywhere
[04:48:41] <Cork> radiodario: it is, and async in the form that the scrip files doens't have to be loaded and parsed before the body tag is shown
[04:48:52] <Cork> *script
[04:49:55] <Cork> and (but i'm not completely sure here), i think theres at least plans to fetch the files async, but run them syncronically
[04:50:22] <Cork> radiodario: script tags in the header has a lot of legacy that needs to be kept to not break old pages
[04:52:01] <peterschmidler> I have a container with many small thumbnails, that I want to fadeIn(500), but instead of fading in it just pops up. I f I deminish the amount of thumbnails, it works again. What can I do about it?
[05:05:10] <jocke12> i am creating a faceted search, and on each facet selection, i use ajax to retrieve new data, and pushstate to set the correct url. however, on the back button, no javascript is ran and i cannot update the search results, using the new url generated. how do i solve this?
[05:16:13] <rahmen> Is there any way of sending an ajax-request with a new session? something like xhrFields:{withCredentials:false} ? I've tried removing the cookie also but with no success. Also tried some with the ajax headers property.. anyone who knows how to do this or if it's possible or not?
[05:20:20] <chilversc_> meh, finally browsers are looking at implementing source code maps
[05:20:39] <chilversc_> I'm sure I said about 2 years ago javascript needs something equivilent to PDBs and got laughed at :)
[05:21:35] <CodesStuff> chilversc_: Why is that being looked into? :\
[05:21:40] <CodesStuff> Also, do you have a link?
[05:26:34] <chilversc_> CodesStuff: http://www.netmagazine.com/news/mozilla-and-webkit-support-source-maps-111311
[05:26:42] <chilversc_> and http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/
[05:27:17] <chilversc_> its being looked into for exactly the reason I initially said, often the JS you see in the browser isn't the original source, its been minified, or the original source was coffeescript or java
[05:27:46] <CodesStuff> ah
[05:38:15] <Jon47> that'll be cool for developers writing coffeescript or something
[05:40:53] <sunbeam> hi, i need the css of a site where the css file is minified (no linebreaks) Is there a way to convert this to a file with linebreaks? Or one that's at least readable
[05:41:22] <chilversc_> Jon47: or those using GWT, or those that use say requirejs + browserfy + minification
[05:41:39] <dean[w]> Hi guys. The draggable UI component allows you to define a grid which it will snap to. I want it to snap to a grid on the droppable instead. So it will snap to a grid on a pre-defined area
[05:41:46] <radiodario> sunbeam: you could use vim with a regular expression where you substitute ; for ;\n
[05:42:03] <radiodario> :%s/;/;\n/g
[05:42:08] <radiodario> that should do it
[05:42:08] <sunbeam> thanks lets try
[05:49:44] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How come $("#tabdetails_" + idarray[1]).text("&laquo; Verberg tab details"); doesn't show the &laquo; symbol correctly?
[05:50:49] <photofroggy> hi
[05:51:02] <photofroggy> can jquery be used to set css for elements that are not yet in the DOM?
[05:51:14] <photofroggy> and don't exist anywhere
[05:53:36] <AdamPDotty> froggy: like in live() ?
[05:53:48] <photofroggy> live()?
[05:54:30] <sahbeewah> ecky--ptang-zoob, because .text treats the string as plain-text... use html() instead
[05:54:42] <sahbeewah> photofroggy, yes you can...
[05:55:00] <Jon47> photofroggy: I don't think jquery is a good fit for that but i recommend checking out jss: https://github.com/Box9/jss
[05:55:20] <Jon47> it dynamically writes css to the stylesheets on the page
[05:55:27] <spots> hi
[05:55:41] <spots> does anyone know how to generate a json string with jquery?
[05:56:26] <photofroggy> live might be the thing I'm looking for
[05:56:28] <sahbeewah> spots, JSON.stringify
[05:56:45] <spots> sahbeewah: thanks
[05:58:04] <Jon47> photofroggy: live is deprecated, and it's for event handling, not stylng..
[05:58:33] <photofroggy> oh
[05:58:53] <photofroggy> I don't really fancy adding another dependency, but jss seems pretty small
[05:59:50] <photofroggy> thanks for the link, Jon47
[06:00:15] <Jon47> dependencies are great
[06:00:22] <Jon47> you don't need to re-invent the wheel every time
[06:00:37] <photofroggy> download sizes increasing are not so great
[06:00:42] <photofroggy> *is
[06:01:38] <Jon47> hehe, i guess you gotta choose then
[06:01:50] <Jon47> more features ~= more code
[06:01:56] <photofroggy> yup
[06:02:03] <sahbeewah> jss seems like the most useless plugin, why would you use that, in any context, ever?
[06:02:29] <photofroggy> to set styles for elements that don't exist yet.
[06:02:49] <photofroggy> Unless you can provide a better solution using jQuery, then jss seems perfect for the task.
[06:03:08] <photofroggy> also; it's not a jQuery plugin.
[06:03:14] <Jon47> i use it for dynamically adding/modifying style rules to elements in a WYSIWYG style CMS page
[06:03:56] <sahbeewah> set styles for elements that don't exist... use CSS
[06:04:01] <sahbeewah> classes
[06:04:09] <photofroggy> uh, after page creation
[06:04:18] <photofroggy> can't really use CSS in this case.
[06:04:33] <sahbeewah> why not?
[06:04:54] <photofroggy> Because I'm receiving data from a stream and setting styles based on that.
[06:04:57] <Jon47> tell my why it's useless in my case
[06:05:14] <Jon47> i need the user's input before i change anything, and when i do get that input, i want to change it in real-time without page refreshes
[06:05:43] <photofroggy> Jon47: if the elements are already there then jQuery may suffice.
[06:05:57] <photofroggy> but, probably not, if you're using jss
[06:06:09] <sahbeewah> You add classes to the new elements that have pre-existing style in the css
[06:06:26] <photofroggy> nope
[06:06:26] <sahbeewah> if you need to derive the style based on the new information, you can use .css()
[06:06:32] <photofroggy> not appropriate
[06:06:44] <photofroggy> the class name is determined after page loading.
[06:07:01] <Jon47> jquery sets inline styles, so it does not perfectly mimic actually changing style rules in the css
[06:07:13] <photofroggy> there's no way to do what I need to do through plain CSS
[06:07:21] <sahbeewah> that's why you add additional classes to the element
[06:07:53] <Jon47> the precedence would be different in my case, plus it's a lot more performant to modify one element in a stylesheet than potentially hundreds int he DOM
[06:08:26] <photofroggy> ? I've already considered my options in jQuery. The only way to do it with jQuery would be really inefficient in comparison to setting a style instantly in jss.
[06:08:28] <bot-t> photofroggy, Couldn't find "I've already considered my options in jQuery. The only way to do it with jQuery would be really inefficient in comparison to setting a style instantly in jss." in jQuery Docs.
[06:08:45] <photofroggy> oops
[06:08:57] <photofroggy> sorry about the bot thing
[06:09:14] <Jon47> you're all right
[06:10:52] <Jon47> photofroggy: for comparison, there is a jquery plugin to do basically the same thing: http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/11/jqueryrule.html
[06:11:05] <subdesign> is it possible to count how many img tags are rendered on the screen (i load images fron hd, so there is time for count) ?
[06:12:23] <photofroggy> Jon47: Not everything needs to be a jQuery plugin.
[06:12:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How do you style lists with Jquery UI ? I have the plugin correctly included and all... but suppose I want to style an <ul> ... What to do to get this done?
[06:12:47] <Jon47> photofroggy: heh, agree.  I like jss better, but i wanted to give you as much perspective as i could
[06:12:51] <photofroggy> Jon47: And to be honest it doesn't look like jQuery.Rule adds anything I'd actually use
[06:12:52] <smatt> How do I run a section of JS only if the file name of the current page == blah.html please?
[06:12:54] * ecky--ptang-zoob is confused
[06:13:05] <photofroggy> Jon47: well, nothing over what jss does.
[06:13:30] <photofroggy> Honestly it surprises me that this kind of thing isn't built into jQuery.
[06:13:55] <Jon47> eh, jquery is more about dom management
[06:14:03] <photofroggy> fair
[06:14:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Anyone?
[06:14:32] <Jon47> it's got lots of other features of course but they've got to be careful with how far they go with those, to avoid getting too cumbersome and large
[06:14:33] <photofroggy> ecky--ptang-zoob: $('ul').css()
[06:14:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> photofroggy: with Jquery UI i mean... already got a theme
[06:14:56] <Jon47> subdesign: it is possible to bind a handler to the "load" event for images, but it will only fire for images that are downloaded (ie, not for images loaded from cache)
[06:14:58] <photofroggy> ecky--ptang-zoob: ignore me then
[06:15:06] <johey> How can I get .contents() as a string without filtering out html tags?
[06:15:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ...
[06:15:17] <subdesign> Jon47, thx
[06:15:33] <subdesign> should i use "on"?
[06:15:38] <johey> .contents().text() filters out html tags, and .contents.html() is empty.
[06:16:00] <blackspotwiggins> johey, .html() ?
[06:16:03] <Jon47> subdesign: i think i read recently about a library that will simulate "load" events for all images but i can't remember where i saw that..  maybe paul irish's twitter feed or somethin..
[06:16:03] <johey> .contents().html() is undefined, I mean.
[06:16:03] <b-ot> johey, memorised “contents().html()”.
[06:16:13] <photofroggy> lol
[06:16:20] <AdamPDotty> .beer
[06:16:23] <subdesign> ok good point
[06:16:53] <johey> blackspotwiggins: b-ot: I need the contents of a text node, with html tags intact.
[06:17:27] <AdamPDotty> text node with html tags?
[06:17:37] <pachet> ^what i said
[06:17:43] <photofroggy> johey: .html()
[06:17:57] <johey> photofroggy: It's undefined.
[06:18:09] <photofroggy> johey: yeah, because you're calling it on .contents()
[06:18:11] <AdamPDotty> hehe
[06:18:15] <photofroggy> johey: which it is not a method of
[06:19:18] <johey> Ok. So how can I get a node as a string, with text representation of its html?
[06:19:28] <photofroggy> .html()
[06:20:53] <johey> photofroggy: Ah. That simple. :)

[06:23:48] <eip56> morning
[06:25:03] <mcnesium> hi i have this problem with jq mobile listview refreshing. it just doesnt do it. heres the code: http://pastie.org/4668074
[06:25:07] <mcnesium> firebug says "cannot call methods on listview prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'refresh'"
[06:25:10] <mcnesium> what does that mean?
[06:26:41] <Gho5t> it sounds like you're calling methods on the widget before it's been initialized
[06:27:52] <pachet> eip56: late response, but good morning!
[06:28:32] <eip56> No worries :-)  Im still drinking muh coffee so your right on time
[06:29:00] <mcnesium> Gho5t: how do i have to initialize it? i created the element and appendet child elements to it.
[06:29:22] <Gho5t> I don't see you creating the widget in your paste
[06:30:00] <Gho5t> it's probably as simple as $('#game-list').listview();
[06:30:08] <Gho5t> before your call to refresh
[06:30:45] <kevc> probably a very basic question, but any idea when I use $(html).find('div') on a string representation of an html document that has a div element immediately inside <body> it doesn't find that div?
[06:31:39] <subdesign> Jon47, i rephrase my question, can I anything do with elements before they are fully loaded?
[06:36:29] <toddWork> so my "array" looks like this in console: [Object, Object] but when i do "typeof", it comes back "object"
[06:37:00] <ajpiano> welcome to javascript
[06:37:11] <CodesStuff> wat
[06:37:12] <b-ot> C students in stronger algorithm theory mush as functional languages do. JS too imature ATM but it will catch up :D
[06:37:12] <ajpiano> ?eval typeof []
[06:37:16] <bot-t> ajpiano: "object"
[06:37:25] <toddWork> but, i can pop and push, so it is an array, correct?
[06:37:36] <ajpiano> toddWork: typeof any array in js yields object,
[06:37:43] <ajpiano> if you want to check if it's an array, use see ?isArray
[06:37:44] <bot-t> jQuery.isArray(obj): Determine whether the argument is an array. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isArray/
[06:37:45] <toddWork> ok, that's fine; it just effects my actual question.
[06:37:51] <toddWork> ah, thanks.
[06:38:02] <ajpiano> or $.type(foo) == "array"
[06:38:03] <toddWork> but, i need to set that array to a cookie and then re-read it.
[06:38:07] <ajpiano> ?$.type
[06:38:08] <bot-t> ajpiano, jQuery.type() - Determine the internal JavaScript [[Class]] of an object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.type/
[06:38:09] <mcnesium> Gho5t: i see. that helped. thx
[06:38:34] <ajpiano> toddWork: serialize it to JSON to store it, unserialize it when you read it back out
[06:38:50] <toddWork> ok. thanks.
[06:39:13] <toddWork> i was confused because i had an "object", but, it's not a JSON object.
[06:39:24] <ajpiano> ?g there's no such thing as a "JSON Object"
[06:39:35] <bot-t> ajpiano, No results found for 'there's no such thing as a "JSON Object"'.
[06:39:42] <Anticom> hi all
[06:40:00] <ajpiano> toddWork: http://benalman.com/news/2010/03/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-json/
[06:40:12] <toddWork> JSON "style" object as opposed to an array "style" object?
[06:40:18] <ajpiano> no
[06:40:24] <rahmen> Is there any way of sending an ajax-request forcing a new session? I've tried xhrFields:{withCredentials:false}, tried removing cookies and tried to manipulate the ajax headers property.. nothing seems to work =/ anyone who knows how to do this or if it's possible or not?
[06:40:26] <Anticom> i'm looking for a menu plugin, that can be hidden like that snippet here http://www.webresourcesdepot.com/sliding-top-menu-with-jquery/ but is a little more generic, dynamic and pettier
[06:40:27] <ajpiano> arrays can be serialized to json as well
[06:40:50] <ajpiano> ?eval JSON.stringify( [ {abc: "def"} ] );
[06:40:50] <bot-t> ajpiano: "[{\"abc\":\"def\"}]"
[06:41:26] <Anticom> rahmen so you mean like actually forcing the server to start a new session, or do you "just" want to remove the session cookie?
[06:41:38] <toddWork> cool. thanks ajpiano
[06:42:19] <rahmen> Anticom: Whatever that enables two requests simultaneously from the same script
[06:42:45] <rahmen> Anticom: Internet explorer does this by default, but firefox uses the same session.
[06:42:54] <Anticom> rahmen you can run two instances at the same time
[06:43:03] <rahmen> how?
[06:43:05] <Anticom> so at the end of the day you want to remove the cookie
[06:43:23] <Anticom> rahmen well just by placing two ajax requests next to each other
[06:43:53] <Anticom> but if your serverside script is depending on the cookie, that's a pitfall
[06:43:57] <rahmen> Anticom: that doesn't work with firefox...
[06:44:00] <rahmen> it's not
[06:44:23] <toddWork> to serialize an array, should i be using $(myArray).serialize()?
[06:44:24] <rahmen> Anticom: the script uploads a file and then pings the server to see the progress
[06:44:53] <Anticom> rahmen so you're adressing two seperate scripts?
[06:44:58] <toddWork> ?serializeArray
[06:44:58] <bot-t> .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[06:45:10] <Anticom> rahmen let me fiddle for a moment :D
[06:46:23] <rahmen> Anticom: The javascript goes to two serverside pages (on the same server).. on of the requests takes a long time, the other one doesn't. In FF the short one has to wait for the long one to finish, in IE it gets the result right away. Sure, go fiddle! :P
[06:46:44] <rahmen> one of the requests...*
[07:00:42] <Anticom> rahmen hmm i feel kinda dumb... lol why does setInterval throw Reference error: getStatus() undefined?!
[07:00:43] <Anticom> window.setInterval
[07:00:47] <Anticom> http://jsfiddle.net/rtJfj/ *
[07:02:12] <triptec> hello, I'm wondering if there's someone who got some productive input on a problem, I'm using a lot of ajax and jquery and set up a lot of listeners. This makes my js files look bad and I don't like to develop in them. a php framework called phproad that uses something like onclick="obj.ajax_replace('#some-div','/some/action/');" inline, I don't particularly like inline js like that and was thinking along the lines <div class="ajax-replace"
[07:02:13] <triptec> data-action="/some/action" data-replace="#some-div"> and then have a more general listener that would read the data attributes and do something nice. I'm not sure this is a good idea or if there's someone that have solved this in another neat way.
[07:02:17] <rahmen> Anticom: donno, do function() { getStatus(); } instead :P
[07:02:41] <Anticom> rahmen no i'm curious about that... that's how callbacks in setInterval usually work :O
[07:02:48] <toddWork> i need to get from this string: "[stuff]" to this array: [stuff]
[07:03:13] <toddWork> oops, got it.
[07:03:51] <rahmen> Anticom: well that's not part of my problem anyway :P
[07:04:09] <Anticom> but i'm not going to ignore problems with workarounds
[07:04:23] <rahmen> ^^
[07:04:24] <danzik17> Anticom: it's not a workaround - the signature you're using is bad.  use a function.
[07:04:37] <danzik17> its a form of eval
[07:04:44] <Anticom> danzik17 um... i'm referencing a function?!
[07:05:36] <danzik17> Anticom: in string form yes.  run your code through any linter and it'll complain about that.  rather, you could just do setInterval( getStatus, 1000 )
[07:05:36] <Anticom> danzik17 so what exactly is the problem? i just don't get it ._.
[07:06:53] <danzik17> Anticom: the problem is that you should seek to avoid eval, and using the correct form of the code fixes your problem in this case.
[07:06:59] <Anticom> thank's danzik17 got it now :)
[07:07:22] <Anticom> danzik17 didn't use setInterval for like years
[07:07:27] <Anticom> rahmen  http://jsfiddle.net/rtJfj/1/
[07:07:29] <Anticom> so there you go
[07:07:38] <Anticom> besides broken appending to the event log it's all working just fine
[07:09:32] <rahmen> Anticom: Yeah it seems so... =/ so... what could be the difference?
[07:10:10] <Anticom> rahmen http://jsfiddle.net/rtJfj/2/ fixed it
[07:10:15] <rahmen> Anticom: I use JSONP for the pinging since it's cross domain
[07:10:25] <Anticom> rahmen since i didn't use your code i can't tell the difference
[07:10:37] <rahmen> Anticom: :)
[07:10:38] <Anticom> rahmen aha
[07:10:39] <dsmart1> hey there, short question. i want to get acces to the "value" f the selected object.and write this to a input field. how can i get acces to this value? post will follow
[07:10:45] <Anticom> um... jsonp has to be synchronus
[07:10:48] <Anticom> @ rahmen
[07:10:56] <Anticom> that's why your script is pausing
[07:11:00] <Anticom> at least afaik
[07:12:01] <rahmen> Anticom: but it works in IE... :P
[07:12:10] <Anticom> that's because IE is bullshit?!
[07:12:18] <faraway> Anticom, rahmen: jsonp is async
[07:12:26] <Anticom> is it?
[07:12:27] <Anticom> hm okay
[07:12:35] <Anticom> then there might be an issue with your implementation
[07:12:59] <Anticom> rahmen i'd recomend to copy my code and adapt it for your project
[07:13:23] <dsmart1> http://jsfiddle.net/uhTfS/4/
[07:13:33] <Anticom> faraway a there's the twist. jsonp doesn't support synchronus ;)
[07:13:41] <faraway> Anticom: jep ;)
[07:14:35] <Anticom> dsmart1 your outer selector is not present in your html ;)
[07:14:44] <Anticom> oh my bad
[07:14:46] <Anticom> it is
[07:15:06] <dsmart1> "foobar" input is working fine
[07:15:18] <rahmen> Anticom: well... it's not much to copy... I do a form.submit() for the post into an iframe. Then I have the same loop with a simple ajax request.
[07:15:20] <dsmart1> but i want to get the value of the selected
[07:16:19] <Anticom> iframes :-!
[07:16:58] <rahmen> Anticom: What I've noticed is that IE gets a new session id when doing ajax requests. To stop this I think withCredentials: true works (but didn't test it). However, to make this cross domain post I need to ping the server to get the progress of the upload. I get the progress with IE and not with FF. So I want FF to act like IE does.
[07:17:28] <Anticom> rahmen code properly instead ;)
[07:18:52] <rahmen> Anticom: it's the only way if I want to do it cross domain and support IE
[07:19:23] <rahmen> Anticom: at least that I know of
[07:19:34] <rahmen> if you know another way that works, plz tell me :P
[07:20:02] <Anticom> never did css, can't help you with that i'm afraid
[07:22:46] <rahmen> Anticom: well I'm pretty sure this is the way to go... but you never know :) anyway.. if it's posted by an iframe or not shouldn't matter. Or maybe I'm wrong about this...?
[07:23:34] <faraway> rahmen: if you need to do a cross domian post you have different possibilities that depends on the situation.
[07:23:41] <Anticom> dsmart1 http://jsfiddle.net/uhTfS/7/
[07:24:27] <faraway> rahmen: either like you saied with the iframe and sending an jsonp request to the server and do long time polling tho get the progress
[07:24:54] <faraway> rahmen: if you own the server where the request comes form you could do some url rewriting/proxy thing
[07:24:57] <Somatt> when clicking on the top menu, slideDown() is supposed to happen but the element just shows straight away. ANy idea why ? http://www.lindicible.com/temp/lyxor/home.php
[07:25:20] <faraway> rahmen: if you can limit the browser versions that are used you can use cors
[07:25:25] <Anticom> dsmart1 btw: you can use .val() anyway instead of .text(), since jq is smart enough to grab the text, if the value attribute is missing
[07:25:50] <Anticom> Somatt what does firebug tell you?
[07:26:08] <rahmen> faraway: I can not manipulate the server, what browsers are limited if I use cors? I need at least IE8+, FF and Chrome.

[07:27:12] <Babak__> hi. I have some problems woring with jqgrid edittype:'select', can someone help me please?

[07:27:18] <dsmart1> @Anticom some ideas?
[07:27:19] <barraponto> am i missing something?
[07:27:33] <Anticom> dsmart1 i posted link to solution already ...
[07:27:43] <Somatt> Anticom: I get an error about jquery and an img not found. Second is not relevant, first is probably due to a too high error level
[07:27:48] <Anticom> Somatt oh and clicking what top menu?

[07:29:05] <dsmart1> thx
[07:30:49] <Anticom> Somatt my firebug tells me, there's no handler registerered to any event at all on the links

[07:32:04] <rahmen> faraway: ok, so this is a solution to the iframe-stuff? It makes it possible to send a cross domain post without using an iframe. But I will still have to poll the server for progress, right? Doesn't that mean I will end up with the same problem?
[07:32:14] <Anticom> Somatt what does ">" do?
[07:32:20] <Anticom> never saw that before tbh :D
[07:32:37] <Somatt> it's direct child selector

[07:39:54] <dean[w]> I have a really peculiar issue with jQuery UI draggable. I drag my item to it's sortable (droppable) area, and "sometimes" it kinda reverts back to it's position, then is swung back across the page to the correct position it should have been dropped in, in the first place. Why?
[07:40:40] <rahmen> faraway: ok, so this is built into the browsers? I'm suspicious... why didn't I find this earlier? What's the catch? :)
[07:41:33] <BillCriswell> ajpiano: #jsmovies is fun.
[07:41:50] <ajpiano> yea! it turned out better than i expected
[07:42:14] <BillCriswell> I've done 4... maybe I should do some actual work.
[07:42:18] <BillCriswell> That's not fun, though.
[07:42:27] <dean[w]> Here is a demo of the suspicious behaviour. Drag about 10-20 words and you will see it happen once. The word will kinda go back to it's original position, and then correct move to where im trying to drop it: http://jsfiddle.net/F4bzh/
[07:42:33] <jscheel> Hi everyone. I'm trying to defined jquery draggables on elements inside of an iframe. Everything works for the first drag, but after I drag an element once, I can't drag it again. Here's a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Cd3pP/3/
[07:43:11] <granden> Anyone know of a plugin that could do what in2media.dk does on there small images on there startpage?
[07:43:11] <chilversc_> rahmen: note, that was slightly incorrect, the SO post said "estimated length" but Content-Length has to be exact
[07:43:16] <granden> Where it splits them in half
[07:43:23] <granden> and then puts them together again?
[07:45:44] <faraway> rahmen:  i just look at this some months before cause i thought of how to use it with jquery but then the project was stopped until end of this year so i didn't do more research. so i can't tell you ;)
[07:46:07] <rahmen> faraway, chilversc: oh... this can be abused by a third party... the information I retrieve is not public. Doing it this way enables javascripts on other sites to fetch data from the server my script fetches data from, since the user is authenticated there.
[07:46:38] <rahmen> do you agree on this or am I thinking wrong?
[07:47:02] <chilversc_> rahmen: uh, hard to say, that doesn't really explain the scenario very well
[07:47:10] <rahmen> ^^
[07:47:50] <faraway> rahmen: as long as you don't use https you are not save ;)
[07:48:03] <chilversc_> rahmen: the first problem the other server will have is cross-origin requests
[07:48:17] <rahmen> faraway: doesn't matter in this case. The user is still authenticated?
[07:48:50] <rahmen> chilversc_: but that's what this method allows - that server can do exactly as I do it with CORS
[07:49:05] <chilversc_> if the user isn't on an up to date browser the other site might be able to use the old override property setter or array class trick, then use a <script> tag to pull the data, if it allows a get request
[07:49:21] <faraway> rahmen: well like chilversc_ said without knowing the scenario it is hard to guess
[07:49:28] <jscheel> hmm, it looks like the stop event is never fired
[07:49:31] <chilversc_> rahmen: but CORS lets the server control and decide which other domains are allowed to accesses it directly (and bypass cross-origin)
[07:49:57] <chilversc_> rahmen: if the server is doing JSONP then it comes down to what the server does to prevent any random site submitting a JSONP request
[07:50:20] <rahmen> chilversc_: yeah but I will not know where the script is executed from :) I will not know beforehand
[07:51:02] <rahmen> chilversc_: I mean that I can not make a lookup list for all servers that I allow to make the xss request
[07:51:05] <codepython777> I've a page that shows up as rendered by crocodoc, but it wont let me print it -- or copy image gives me a black image
[07:51:11] <codepython777> how can i get the original file?
[07:51:19] <jscheel> here's an updated fiddle showing that stop is not fired when dragging elements inside of an iframe: http://jsfiddle.net/Cd3pP/4/
[07:52:26] <rahmen> chilversc_, faraway: The script will be executed from a random domain that the server won't know. <-- that's the scenario :)
[07:52:48] <chilversc_> rahmen: well then by definition if you're saying you're going to enable CORS for any domain, and not filter/whitelist them, then you're saying you'll allow any external site access so long as the user has authenticated
[07:53:13] <rahmen> chilversc_: yep, that's why I can't choose that option
[07:53:32] <rahmen> and that's why I'm an iframe
[07:53:35] <rahmen> using an*
[07:53:36] <faraway> rahmen: well how do you identify the client how is he authed ?
[07:53:58] <rahmen> faraway: username and password and https
[07:55:17] <faraway> rahmen: with the http authenticate header or with session id ?
[07:56:35] <pangelovski> hi
[07:56:38] <rahmen> faraway: I authenticate and get a token that I send for each request
[07:57:42] <rahmen> faraway: why are you asking? :)
[07:57:59] <pangelovski> im getting some json data, and one of the "fields" is a subcategory. since i have about 70 rows, I'm wondering if there is some functionality to get all unique subcategories
[07:58:06] <faraway> rahmen: just to get the complete scenario ;)
[07:58:19] <pangelovski> like sql's distinct
[07:59:35] <faraway> rahmen: so you have a script that should be included on a page. you want to make sure that other scripts on the page won't be able to access your server. so your original idea was to use the main code (with the token) in an iframe. so that it cannot be exploited
[08:01:08] <rahmen> faraway: not other scripts on the same page.. I don't want to enable Access-Control-Allow-Origin because I don't know what to whitelist.
[08:02:07] <asker> hey guys, im cant get to the vars of a funtion out of a child function, http://jsfiddle.net/2trtB/ could you help me pls
[08:02:16] <defaultro_> hey guys, we have this api which uses http to submit changes. Unfortunately, the data I need is not returned in the object yet(in the works). However, the data I need is in the http response. Is that possible to grab?
[08:02:53] <rahmen> faraway: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * <-- this would make scripts on _any_ page be able to access information from the server with the clients credentials.. so that's no good :)
[08:05:30] <faraway> rahmen: thats true, but if every request is handled by a script which delivers the file or handles the requests, you can validate the request with the token you submit
[08:06:34] <rahmen> faraway: hmm... maybe you have a point.. got to think a bit :)
[08:07:02] <faraway> rahmen: the problem is you need to make sure that the token is not readable by the other scripts, which can be painful because the are some ways to get data on Object create even if you are not the owner of the Object because of some browsers bugs/features
[08:08:45] <rahmen> faraway: you mean that scripts in one tab can read information in another tab?
[08:10:29] <faraway> rahmen: no that other script included in the same page could be able to get the token and to requests
[08:12:52] <tintin> Is facebook a business?
[08:12:52] <rahmen> faraway: Ok, but that's cool, these scripts will not be spread to everyone but only trusted servers.
[08:13:00] <tintin> Does facebook use jquery?
[08:13:10] <tintin> Or Does facebook use regular javascript?
[08:13:16] <makkura> I'm having a problem catching modifier keys. I'm using .keyup to catch control and alt keypresses. I'm trying to use them individually, not as part of a key combination. These work as intended in chrome and firefox in linux. Every windows version of chrome and firefox I've tried it on, though, it doesn't trigger unless a key combination is pressed with that modifier.
[08:13:55] <rahmen> faraway: feels like it's their problem if they go to a random page and enter their credentials :P
[08:14:31] <faraway> rahmen: well depends on the scenario ;)
[08:15:03] <tintin> Does facebook use jquery? Or Does facebook use regular javascript?
[08:16:35] <rahmen> faraway: well, a scenario like that won't exist I think. I think it's secure enough.
[08:17:38] <rahmen> faraway: however, a solution to the FF vs IE thing would be best for me since then I don't have to reconstruct my code...
[08:23:17] <Palanivel> Hi Hi.............. i declared var aa = []  ............ i want to store in this variable like [{ "abc","10"},{"asd","20"}]...........
[08:23:29] <Palanivel> it's possible in jquery
[08:24:06] <Clex> Palanivel: aa.push()
[08:24:32] <Palanivel> i wanna store dynamically as object in array
[08:25:57] <makkura> Palanivel: You need to declare your object {} and then you push that object into the aa array like Clex said. aa.push(bb};
[08:26:08] <Palanivel> @clex..........if am using push means it,s creating like array..............aa = ["abc","10","asd","20"]...........but i waan to store spe
[08:26:56] <faraway> rahmen: just that you know it: http://jsfiddle.net/HumxB/4/
[08:27:07] <NoiseEee> ?eval var aa = []; var b = {dog:'ralph',cat:'meowie'};aa.push(b); b;
[08:27:09] <bot-t> NoiseEee: {"dog": "ralph", "cat": "meowie"}
[08:27:11] <makkura> var aa = []; var bb = {x:2, y:2}; aa.push(bb); // aa => [{x:2, y:2}]
[08:27:14] <NoiseEee> ?eval var aa = []; var b = {dog:'ralph',cat:'meowie'};aa.push(b); a;
[08:27:14] <bot-t> NoiseEee: ReferenceError: a is not defined

[08:27:17] <bot-t> NoiseEee: [{"dog": "ralph", "cat": "meowie"}]
[08:27:41] <faraway> rahmen: that's why i said you need to be able to trust the page.
[08:27:53] <makkura> That's a handy bot feature. ^^
[08:28:26] <Palanivel> @makkura..........i ill try and get back to u...........thankzzzzzzzzzzzz
[08:28:38] <Clex> People are weird.
[08:29:42] <faraway> rahmen: if you don't know which scripts are loaded on the page then there could be a script that listens to your whole communication
[08:31:07] <makkura> Just reiterating my issue in case someone has some insight on it:
[08:31:13] <makkura> I'm having a problem catching modifier keys. I'm using .keyup to catch control and alt keypresses. I'm trying to use them individually, not as part of a key combination. These work as intended in chrome and firefox in linux. Every windows version of chrome and firefox I've tried it on, though, it doesn't trigger unless a key combination is pressed with that modifier.
[08:33:53] <sjeijk> is there a way to target a new window and have target that window for _blank links ?
[08:35:45] <faraway> sjeijk: you open a new window and as soon as it is open you want that all links with target blank are opend in this wndow ?
[08:36:06] <sjeijk> kindof yes
[08:36:08] <Palanivel> @makkura..........i am declared var aa = "abc"; var bb = "10" var cc = { aa,bb}......means it's showing some html tag error ......may i know what is the problem
[08:36:17] <sjeijk> at least my client wants that
[08:36:44] <sjeijk> having his home page open all the time, and when some1 click a pdf open another window for only pdfs
[08:37:09] <sjeijk> so when I open 10 pdfs, that pdf will only be visible in that page instead of 10 new windows
[08:37:54] <Palanivel> @bot-t.............may i know what is the problem
[08:38:22] <faraway> sjeijk: so why don't you set target=_blank for the pdfs ?
[08:38:45] <sjeijk> faraway, then when he opens 10 pdfs he has 10 open tabs
[08:38:57] <sjeijk> he wants 1 tab for the pdfs
[08:39:15] <faraway> sjeijk: target=pdf ?
[08:39:23] <sjeijk> is that valid?
[08:39:48] <rahmen> faraway: yeah, but I think it's good enough. it's a lot worse with scrips on other pages :) I guess the form is annoying my ajax calls in ff: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/473038/post-versus-ajax-call I'll try to fiddle it
[08:39:53] <faraway> sjeijk: you can use anyname for the target the newly opend tab/window has this name/id and all other links with that target will open there
[08:40:52] <Palanivel> @makkura..........am getting like this error.............SyntaxError: invalid object initializer
[08:41:02] <sjeijk> oh nice faraway tx!
[08:41:23] <makkura> Palanivel: be sure each line ends with a ; and if you have multiple lines (such as multiple declarations) on the same line, end each one with a ;
[08:41:59] <dogarrhea2> u know what's great about 3 day weekends?
[08:42:03] <dogarrhea2> it's already the middle of the week
[08:42:07] <Palanivel> @makkura..........in console only am trying........but it showing erroe
[08:42:21] <makkura> Palanivel: Otherwise your object needs some properties.. {aa,bb,cc} isn't valid because it isn't an array
[08:42:37] <Palanivel> @makkura..........i wanna make the key and values as dynamic.........that's y
[08:42:53] <makkura> Palanivel: {property: value}  so you could do {aa:'aa'}
[08:43:20] <makkura> Palanivel: but what you're giving it is a string.. you're not giving it a pair
[08:43:38] <Palanivel> @makkura..........then how to make it dynamic
[08:44:00] <Palanivel> @makkura..........b'coz am stroing as strinh
[08:44:21] <Palanivel> @makkura..........b'coz am storing as string
[08:44:34] <Palanivel> @makkura..........any other way
[08:44:39] <dshap> hey all - i'm using jQuery promises and i'm in a situation where the callback in my $.when() is being fired only when the ajax request completes very quickly.  if i use an ajax request that takes a couple seconds, then the $.when() callback is not being fired.  i'm very new to the whole deferred/promise concept and i have no idea what would cause this to happen.  any ideas?  p.s. i'm using an internal framework that creates the pro
[08:44:39] <dshap> - it may be the source of the problem
[08:45:19] <dogarrhea2> does jquery support any reflection like construct?
[08:46:15] <makkura> Palanivel: well.. if these are just strings.. why not make a multidimensional array instead?  [["aa","bb"],["cc"]] ?
[08:47:17] <Palanivel> @makkura..........ya u r correct..............
[08:47:17] <b-ot> Palanivel, no U r correct..............
[08:47:27] <faraway> dogarrhea2: what do you mean with reflection like construct (accessing function names with a string) ?
[08:47:40] <dogarrhea2> yes
[08:47:53] <dogarrhea2> here we are using haxe. and compiling to javascript and using reflection
[08:48:04] <dogarrhea2> but of course, the code looks like gibberish
[08:48:13] <makkura> Palanivel: That way you don't need a property name and you can still group things in the same secondary array if they need to be together (i'm guessing that's why you were wanting an object)
[08:48:34] <subdesign> anybody know what is the plugin that can scroll large one-page sites?
[08:49:28] <faraway> dogarrhea2: well instead of $(".some .selector").append(...)   you can always do $(".some .selector")["append"](...) or $(".some .selector")[funcNameVar](...)  but thats a js feature not jquery
[08:49:52] <Palanivel> @makkura..........ya i  ill try in arrray itself and if any issue i will let u know
[08:49:52] <b-ot> Palanivel, no U know
[08:50:12] <faraway> dogarrhea2: if this is your question
[08:51:11] <klj613> if i have `var foo = $('.foo', container);` how can i make var foo select newly created .foo's ? is that possible or do i ahve to use $('.foo', container) everywhere
[08:54:07] <Gho5t> klj613: if you are binding an event handler to them you can use .on
[08:55:34] <klj613> Gho5t, i know. just i pass a variable 'modal' to several functions. but that modal might be replaced with another one.
[08:55:41] <Phoenixz> Good morning, Using jquery, and jquery mobile... I want to load some jquery libs specifically for ONE page of my mobile site, not all. Now, I have seen that JQM will not process <head> for subsequent pages, so I seem to have 2 options: 1: Load all scripts in page one (causing me to load lots of JS that might never be used, waste of bandwidth) or 2: Load the scripts in the body, risking the problem of libs not being available at all.. Are there any
[08:55:42] <Phoenixz> better solutions for this?
[08:55:53] <klj613> var modal = $('.modal', container); functionName(modal);
[08:57:03] <Gho5t> then I guess you'll have to pass the new list when an item is added to the collection
[08:57:06] <Gho5t> that's my guess though
[08:57:10] <Gho5t> might be something better
[08:58:01] <klj613> i guess i make a function like modalGetter();
[08:58:08] <klj613> just something better obv :P
[08:59:05] <faraway> klj613: you could use .not and .add to manipulate the existing result set, if it is because of the references to it
[09:00:13] <klj613> faraway, ok thanks
[09:00:45] <Gho5t> or *gasp* a global variable
[09:00:55] <Gho5t> window.modals..etc
[09:01:09] <faraway> klj613: ah sorry. my fault, it does not manupilate the set itselfe
[09:01:42] <klj613> lol. i was going to go with a function to get the modal anyway :)
[09:06:01] <jetsaredim> need some help with the jquery tabs ajax demo

[09:33:10] <Gates> i wrote a script that flips content around based off sorts and filters

[09:33:44] <Gates> any suggestions. I need to make it so the content under it (title+dec) have different wording on different sorts
[09:33:45] <Gates> http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/7u34J/
[09:34:02] <BBanet> Can anyone tell me if it's more appropriate to use ajaxStop of the Deferred object to handle an event on complete of a series of ajax requests?

[10:09:22] <Phoenixz> Good morning, Using jquery, and jquery mobile... I want to load some jquery libs specifically for ONE page of my mobile site, not all. Now, I have seen that JQM will not process <head> for subsequent pages, so I seem to have 2 options: 1: Load all scripts in page one (causing me to load lots of JS that might never be used, waste of bandwidth) or 2: Load the scripts in the body, risking the problem of libs not being available at all.. Are there any
[10:09:23] <Phoenixz> better solutions for this?
[10:10:27] <FunnyLookinHat> Phoenixz, Loading libs in the body is fairly standard nowadays I believe...  the html5 boilerplate specifically encourages it even
[10:10:58] <FunnyLookinHat> If I were you I'd just have an array of libs and loop through them at the end of your page render, and append the extra ones you need on the specific pages that require them/.
[10:11:12] <FunnyLookinHat> ( speaking from a frame]work perspective - you could obviously just statically add them )
[10:13:25] <crankharder> for a widget I want to initializer some evnets on $('body'), but only one time, not more than once if the widget is invoked multiple times. how can i do that?
[10:21:15] <Phoenixz> FunnyLookinHat: Thats a new one.. Well, problem one is that I'd need to load CSS and JS from a host in a different domain.. I already added getStyle (basically a jQuery extension that does the same as getScript, but for CSS) and both fail due to different host restrictions
[10:21:48] <FunnyLookinHat> Right - you'll have to include them as tags within your body
[10:21:57] <FunnyLookinHat> and they have to be there in the original response.
[10:22:04] <FunnyLookinHat> Or else you'll have to mirror them locally.
[10:23:01] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: can you give me an example of deferred when you get a chance?
[10:23:08] <someprimetime> i've never used it nor do i know what to use it for
[10:24:24] <Phoenixz> FunnyLookinHat: Would it then, maybe, be an idea to just include the <script> and do a timeout check on if $.photoSwipe exists or not?
[10:24:35] <Mr_Grim> hey. whats the easiest way to get the width/height of an image <img /> ?
[10:24:40] <Phoenixz> like, wait 1 second, check... if it doesnt exist yet, wait another second and try again?
[10:25:14] <FunnyLookinHat> Phoenixz, I guess?  It sounds to me like you should really be hosting the library locally
[10:25:29] <FunnyLookinHat> Also
[10:25:43] <FunnyLookinHat> If you do everything within $(function() { } ); you shouldn't have any issues then with elements loaded in body
[10:25:53] <FunnyLookinHat> They're all there by the time that runs.
[10:26:03] <FunnyLookinHat> And if you get a 404 - well then you're SOL anyways :D
[10:26:44] <someprimetime> FunnyLookinHat: except if it's an image...
[10:26:52] <someprimetime> in which case you'd use $(window).load(function(){
[10:26:56] <someprimetime> but that's just nitpicking.
[10:26:56] <FunnyLookinHat> someprimetime, Right - but this is a script
[10:27:01] <FunnyLookinHat> You're absolutely right though :)
[10:27:26] <someprimetime> Mr_Grim: are you the imgur mr grim or an imposter?
[10:27:31] <FunnyLookinHat> someprimetime, sounds like you should be answering this question!  I'm no jQ master... I just know enough to get by....  :D
[10:27:34] <someprimetime> i'm thinking the latter
[10:27:44] <FunnyLookinHat> Chances are an imposter.
[10:28:05] <FunnyLookinHat> Step #1 to imgur: know how to use .width()
[10:28:16] <someprimetime> ha! +1
[10:28:18] <FunnyLookinHat> Step #2: .height()
[10:28:49] <FunnyLookinHat> Mr_Grim, Unless you've manually resized it ( i.e. with a css attribute or style value ) you just use .width() and .height()
[10:29:27] <FunnyLookinHat> If you're trying to do some fancy ajax'd resizing and stuff - the best thing to do is load the image off-screen ( i.e. position:absolute; left: -99999px; ) and then do a .width() and .height() to get the dimensions
[10:29:37] <FunnyLookinHat> Then resize as you want it and set the position back to relative and remove the left param
[10:29:38] <FunnyLookinHat> etc.
[10:33:23] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: I have four examples for you
[10:33:48] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: First one makes 10 AJAX requests at once that take different amounts of time
[10:34:02] <Mr_Grim> got it
[10:34:05] <Eviltwin> And you want to run something only once all of them are finished
[10:34:07] <Mr_Grim> i had to use the Image Object
[10:34:07] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/GxfTv/
[10:34:10] <Heather_> Is there any function that does the opposite of the data() function? i.e retrieving attribute data?
[10:34:37] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Second is how you can take a list of URLs and download them one at a time, then do something when that's finished: http://jsfiddle.net/GxfTv/2/
[10:35:42] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: The third is the same as the second except it's encapsulated into a "worker" which, like the second one, keeps doing the next thing in the queue until its empty then triggers a deferred
[10:35:50] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/GxfTv/3/
[10:36:33] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: oh wow
[10:36:40] <someprimetime> this would have come in handy with the photo uploader that i made awhile ago
[10:36:45] <someprimetime> thanks for the examples
[10:36:47] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: The fourth is the same as the third except there's now two workers that are both working to empty the queue meaning there are two requests going at any time until the queue is empty and once the final request is complete, it triggers a deferred
[10:36:51] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/GxfTv/4/
[10:37:28] <someprimetime> oh that's what you use `when()` for too...
[10:37:36] <someprimetime> TIL
[10:37:38] <someprimetime> thanks!
[10:38:06] <Eviltwin> $.when(A, B) is a deferred that gets resolved once both A and B are resolved
[10:38:12] <digitalcakestudi> is there a save_post action for only custom post types?
[10:38:29] <digitalcakestudi> for example save_{customposttype} ?
[10:42:44] <digitalcakestudi> durp sorry wrong chan
[10:45:27] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: thanks again
[10:47:12] <Gabriel> how can I obtain the value of $('#tabs a[href="#tab2"]'); ?? it's supposed to be #tab1, #tab2, #tab3

[10:48:26] <Eviltwin> Uh
[10:48:30] <Spikes> I'm not sure what do you want, thought
[10:48:35] <Gabriel> var clickedTab = $('#tabs a[href="#tab^"]');
[10:48:35] <someprimetime> don't use those sizzle selectors
[10:48:35] <Spikes> though*
[10:48:36] <Gabriel> ?
[10:48:50] <someprimetime> maybe you want $.each()?
[10:49:08] <Spikes> someprimetime, why not?
[10:49:08] <Eviltwin> Perhaps this is what you're looking for? http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[10:49:17] <someprimetime> Spikes: they're kinda jenky imo
[10:49:29] <Spikes> someprimetime, i've never used them, so was interested
[10:51:06] <DarkKnightCZ> hi, is it possible to modify css attribute (margin) of class, which currently isnt in any element
[10:51:37] <Eviltwin> DarkKnightCZ: You mean change the definition of the class itself so that anything that has or gets that class will have the new margin?
[10:51:48] <DarkKnightCZ> Eviltwin: yes
[10:52:05] <Eviltwin> It's possible in some browsers but jQuery won't really help you with it
[10:52:34] <DarkKnightCZ> well, i need it only in chrome

[10:53:47] <Eviltwin> DarkKnightCZ: It involves digging into the style sheet objects: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/document.styleSheets
[10:54:14] <DarkKnightCZ> hmm, thanks
[10:54:47] <Eviltwin> DarkKnightCZ: Try using the Web Inspector to look at document.styleSheets[0].rules
[10:55:30] <Shadow> Hi, can anyone help with this please. <option value="1" class="cat_checkbox" type="checkbox" id="1_box" name="box[]" /> If I do a this.className I get cat_checkbox. How do I get the name. I tried this.name but it didn't work.
[10:56:04] <Eviltwin> Shadow: Look at .getAttribute('name') in JavaScript or .attr('name') in jQuery
[10:57:34] <jtw> testing...is this working?
[10:57:44] <CodesStuff> mhmm
[10:57:52] <Kit-10> depends on what this is
[10:58:08] <Shadow> Eviltwin: thank you
[10:59:01] <Guest60386> anyone could help please?
[11:00:02] <someprimetime> jtw: no
[11:04:37] <CharlieBrown_Nar> howdy!
[11:05:12] <slick-> hello, i have this code http://jsfiddle.net/tjYt5/ with counter i, but i would like to do counter[category] = counter[category] + 1
[11:05:15] <slick-> like a python dictionary
[11:05:21] <slick-> does anyone know how i can implement this
[11:06:51] <Eviltwin> slick-: Which counter?
[11:07:06] <slick-> so there are different categories
[11:07:13] <slick-> and everytime an item has been added of that category
[11:07:16] <slick-> i wanna keep count of it
[11:07:17] <Eviltwin> I don't see where the current counter is?
[11:07:20] <Eviltwin> Is it "i"?
[11:07:21] <slick-> yes
[11:07:50] <slick-> so where it says ( i+1 ), i want it to be counter[category] + 1
[11:07:51] <Eviltwin> Well what Python calls dictionaries, JavaScript calls objects
[11:07:55] <slick-> oh
[11:08:00] <Eviltwin> var mydict = {};
[11:08:10] <Eviltwin> mydict.foobar = 3;
[11:08:17] <Eviltwin> mydict["foobar"] = 3
[11:08:19] <gkatsev> java calls maps/hashes, php calls associate arrays
[11:08:32] <Eviltwin> mydict[somevariable] = 3
[11:08:36] <Eviltwin> And so on
[11:08:54] <Eviltwin> Java calls it a map everywhere, no?
[11:08:58] <Eviltwin> Perl calls it a hash
[11:10:14] <slick-> awesome thanks
[11:10:31] <Raydiation> how do i get the first child element of a <div> and but only if its an img tag?
[11:11:20] <Gho5t> $('div img:first-child')
[11:13:02] <CharlieBrown_Nar> Has anyone every tried to perform an element "position()" (such as a modal dialog to the center of the window)  using a transition effect or an animation?
[11:13:34] <jtw> does anyone know of a good marketplace online where I can hire a jquery coder to fix a small bug?
[11:13:39] <CharlieBrown_Nar> I can't find anything on the forums on that. Maybe I should use chainnin?
[11:14:43] <Guest60386> How could i make that that div's are always diffrent meaing they increment themslef in order to make the reply function working?
[11:15:44] <jtw> I'd like to do this, and pay for it, today
[11:15:45] <Gabriel> anything wrong with this syntax $('#tabs a[href="'window.location.hash'"]').tab('show');  ?
[11:16:54] <Eviltwin> Guest60386: http://jsfiddle.net/d6KEh/
[11:17:17] <Eviltwin> Gabriel: Yes
[11:17:35] <Gabriel> it works but it breaks my script after
[11:19:04] <CharlieBrown_Nar> $('#modalOverlay').position({
[11:19:04] <CharlieBrown_Nar> my: "center",
[11:19:04] <CharlieBrown_Nar>  at: "center",
[11:19:04] <CharlieBrown_Nar>  of: window
[11:19:04] <CharlieBrown_Nar> }) can this be animated while doing the positioning?
[11:19:23] <Gabriel> what is wrong with it Eviltwin?
[11:21:05] <darkfrog> hey guys, I'm trying to use jQuery UI's "dialog", but I'm trying to scroll the body content to the bottom
[11:21:17] <darkfrog> anyone know how I might accomplish that?
[11:21:22] <Guest60386> Eviltwin, thank you, i will just check how it works on the website now
[11:23:42] <Phoenixz> I need to use jQuery to load javascripts from another domain. I am on "http://m.mextl.dnsdynamic.com/foobar.html"  and I need to get the file http://192.168.0.106/cdn/photo/photo.css  To avoid "is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin" problems I added the header "Access-Control-Allow-Origin:http://192.168.0.106" but this does not seem to work (I get the error anyway).. What am I doing wrong here?
[11:25:28] <NoiseEee> 192.168.0.106 is a local IP Phoenixz; nothing should stop you from loading http://elsewhere.org/file.css
[11:25:38] <timforgach> Hello everyone. Does anyone have experience with using datepicker, using droppable items?
[11:25:57] <Phoenixz> NoiseEee: Actually I am on elsewhere, and I want to load something from 192.168.0.106...
[11:26:04] <Phoenixz> But I still get the access restriction error
[11:26:21] <Raydiation> Gho5t: wouldnt that get me the first img in a div
[11:26:26] <Raydiation> no matter where it is?
[11:26:30] <NoiseEee> Phoenixz: how are you loading it?  and like i say... 192.168* is local to your actual network, and is not available on the internet
[11:26:37] <slick-> does anyone know why my mydict counter isnt working http://jsfiddle.net/p2TMr/
[11:26:52] <Gho5t> Raydiation: no $('div img:first') would do that
[11:27:01] <Raydiation> Gho5t: ty
[11:27:09] <Gho5t> yep
[11:27:55] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ slick-
[11:27:56] <bot-t> slick-, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[11:28:17] <Phoenixz> NoiseEee: I use jquery $.get() to load the file.. and 192.168.0.106 is actually my own machine, though in production, it wll be another server on the internet (and it won't be 192.168.something, it will be cdn.somehost.com)
[11:28:32] <Gabriel>                     $('#tabs a[href="'lastTab'"]').tab('show');  anyone know why I'm getting a SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list error ?
[11:28:32] <Eviltwin> slick-: Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/p2TMr/1/
[11:28:53] <slick-> <3
[11:28:55] <slick-> thank you god bless
[11:29:59] <NoiseEee> Phoenixz: look into jsonp
[11:30:14] <Phoenixz> Gabriel: You might need to escape one of the ' or "
[11:30:29] <Gabriel> with \ ?
[11:30:54] <Phoenixz> NoiseEee: But isnt Access-Control-Allow-Origin designed to do just this... ?
[11:31:01] <CodesStuff> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ruby%20on%20the%20rails
[11:31:08] <Phoenixz> Gabriel: yes
[11:31:10] <CodesStuff> Check the definitions for laughs
[11:31:28] <NoiseEee> Phoenixz: sure, if you control the server you're requesting from and send appropriate headers
[11:32:26] <Phoenixz> NoiseEee: Its actually the other server that has to send these headers?
[11:33:21] <Phoenixz> weird.. It made sense to me that I would tell the browser what external resources are allowed.. If another server of which I have no control is telling "hey, I am allowed for your page", would that not open up a can of worms, security wise?
[11:35:27] <NoiseEee> Phoenixz: it could yes, but one could just allow access from specified domains lets say, instead of *.   you might want to load it via proxy/backend, or just add a new element (<link>) and set the src to the css file you want.
[11:36:30] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hi, I'm using JQUERY UI tabs... Does anyone know how to make a tab that links to an external url, rather than loading content into the tab?
[11:37:06] <CodesStuff> maybe onclick="return false;"?
[11:37:09] <CodesStuff> or prevent default
[11:37:14] <CodesStuff> the document.location redirect
[11:38:29] <Phoenixz> NoiseEee: Yeah, tought about adding just the new element, but the problem there is that then I will not know if the file is loaded or still in the process of loading..  But again, what I do not understand entirely is where I should add the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.. Should that header be added to my page (as I do right now) or should it be added to the CSS file  (and later on also JS files) I am trying to add to the page?
[11:40:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> hmm
[11:41:27] <NoiseEee> Phoenixz: tbh i've never done what you're doing; i'm pretty sure you need to specify jsonp in your jquery/xhr request; you can read https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP_access_control for more info perhaps?
[11:41:52] <makkura> Just reiterating my issue in case someone has some insight on it:
[11:42:00] <makkura> I'm having a problem catching modifier keys. I'm using .keyup to catch control and alt keypresses. I'm trying to use them individually, not as part of a key combination. These work as intended in chrome and firefox in linux. Every windows version of chrome and firefox I've tried it on, though, it doesn't trigger unless a key combination is pressed with that modifier.
[11:45:20] <wachpwnski> why does my ajax request work, and then after the first success it returns nothing?
[11:48:44] <chuwiey> Hi all, if I have <form action="bla" id="x" name="x"><input ...> <button type="submit" form="x"> </form> and I use $('form#x').on('submit', function(e) {...} ) - but nothing happens when I click the <button> - what might be the probelm?
[11:49:06] <NoiseEee> chuwiey: your console.log might know
[11:49:33] <wachpwnski> on submit never worked for me
[11:49:33] <chuwiey> NoiseEee: nothing showing.. not even the console.log('we've submitted') i've put right after the start of the event...
[11:51:12] <wachpwnski> chuwiey: should be .subumit( handler )
[11:51:19] <timforgach> Does anyone know of an easy way to dump jQuery object info?
[11:51:39] <chuwiey> wachpwnski, NoiseEee: if I do .on('click') for the button itself, it works of course.. but then I can't create a generic $.post() for all the forms with a .serialize()... I tried .submit(handler) but that didn't work either...
[11:51:41] <wachpwnski> $('form#x').submit( function() { … } )
[11:52:24] <wachpwnski> can you jfiddle your code?
[11:52:47] <chuwiey> wachpwnski: not easily.. but you can go to http://www.gofish.io
[11:53:40] <wachpwnski> chuwiey:   what is this? <script src="http://www.gofish.io/assets/js//libs/modernizr-2.5.3.min.js?v=1346871198"></script>
[11:53:40] <wachpwnski> <script src="http://www.gofish.io/assets/js//libs/less-1.3.0.min.js?v=1346871198"></script>
[11:53:46] <wachpwnski> js//libs ?
[11:54:27] <chuwiey> wachpwnski: those are fine.. it's just a problem with some backend defines..
[11:54:32] <chuwiey> still everything works
[11:54:49] <chuwiey> the script is in script.js
[11:54:51] <chuwiey> :)
[11:55:00] <chuwiey> line 32
[11:57:04] <Aristata> How can I serialize a group of inputs that are not in a form?
[11:57:14] <Phoenixz> NoiseEee: Am I then really the only one loading JS from another host?
[11:58:35] <Eviltwin> Phoenixz: Wait, what's going on now?
[11:58:37] <Eviltwin> I just got back
[11:59:40] <Phoenixz> Eviltwin: I have a site on http://a.com, and I want to load CSS and JS files from http://b.com using $.get .....
[11:59:55] <Eviltwin> Why $.get?
[12:00:01] <Eviltwin> Why not by adding a <link> or <script> tabg?
[12:00:04] <Eviltwin> tag*
[12:00:06] <Phoenixz> Eviltwin: To avoid the origin limitation, in my page on a.com I added the HTTP header Access-Control-Allow-Origin
[12:00:08] <Eviltwin> With a href or src respectively
[12:00:13] <Phoenixz> Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://b.com
[12:00:14] <Phoenixz> basically
[12:00:58] <Phoenixz> Eviltwin: Problem with the link and script tag is that I don't know when the files will be loaded.. I don;t know if I can already start doing the JS.. I could do something with timeouts and check if a certain $.method is available, but that's not very pretty..
[12:01:13] <Phoenixz> Eviltwin: Plus, I'd still don't know if the CSS is loaded already or not..
[12:01:23] <Eviltwin> Scripts have an onload
[12:01:30] <Eviltwin> I believe links do too in modern browsers
[12:01:36] <Phoenixz> Eviltwin: If there is a way to confirm that the content of a <link> or <script> is loaded, I'll use that..
[12:02:04] <Phoenixz> Eviltwin: Besides that, right now its just outright curiosity.. How do I use this Access-Control-Allow-Origin header?
[12:02:30] <Eviltwin> Phoenixz: It's explained here: http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/
[12:02:40] <Phoenixz> Eviltwin: From what I've read, and what makes sense, is that my webpage tells the browser from where I can get my resources.. So in my PHP I added the header tag that does Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://b.com\
[12:03:04] <Phoenixz> But from what I understand now, and what makes little sense to me, I have to add this header to each resource on b.com...
[12:03:41] <Phoenixz> Also, Access-Control-Allow-Origin works on all mobile browsers? say, iphone3, androids, etc? (yes yes, I'll google)
[12:03:50] <Eviltwin> Phoenixz: I'd suggest looking here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5750696/how-to-get-a-cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors-post-request-working or here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5584923/a-cors-post-request-works-from-plain-javascript-but-why-not-with-jquery
[12:05:11] <wachpwnski> chuwiey:  http://jsfiddle.net/TUdK6/  <- that is all you should need.
[12:06:20] <chuwiey> wachpwnski: if i'm not mistaken the only difference here is that you added a div around the hidden input field?
[12:06:37] <wachpwnski> chuwiey: also noticed your php is not handling an array that is coming $_POST vars probably.
[12:07:07] <Phoenixz> Eviltwin: Will do so, thanks a lot!
[12:07:18] <chuwiey> wachpwnski: ? (the backend function currently handling the submit is just an echo...
[12:07:35] <chuwiey> wachpwnski: is the div really the issue?
[12:08:44] <danzik17> Phoenixz: alternatively, it looks like using $.getScript ( or preferably something like RequireJS ) should work for your use case
[12:09:18] <wachpwnski> chuwiey: div should not be an issue.
[12:09:43] <chuwiey> wachpwnski: right, then what is the difference between your example and my script? how come mine doesn't work whereas yours does... ?
[12:09:49] <Chuguniy> Hey guys! Can someone help me with a transition effect, here is a code http://pastebin.com/R8JiX8yp The thing is that it is working almost as I need, but not quite, load('transition.html') is not loading, I'm asuming because later in the code I load another .html wich is being loaded in the begining.
[12:10:03] <wachpwnski> chuwiey: I don't even know where you script is, looking at the source
[12:10:33] <chuwiey> i'll jsfiddle ...
[12:17:05] <Cork> Chuguniy: what you code does is: 1. queue to load 'transition.html', 2. stop the load and queue to load 'home.html', 3. start the animation of the container to opacity 0 and height 214px
[12:17:34] <Cork> Chuguniy: if you chain actions after an animating call its not delayed until the animation ends
[12:19:21] <Chuguniy> Cork: Thanks. So how do I separate those loads?
[12:19:29] <Cork> Chuguniy: so container.animate({}, 1500).animate({}, 1500).load('transition.html'); container.animate({}, 1500).animate({}, 1500).load('home.html');
[12:19:31] <Cork> becomes container.load('transition.html').load('home.html').animate({}, 1500).animate({}, 1500); container.animate({}, 1500).animate({}, 1500);
[12:19:53] <Cork> and the loads doesn't wait for eachother they cancel the first one
[12:20:02] <Cork> Chuguniy: you need to use callbacks
[12:20:08] <Cork> ?.load
[12:20:09] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/

[12:20:36] <Cork> ah
[12:20:37] <Eviltwin> Meh
[12:20:40] <Cork> Eviltwin: thx
[12:21:16] <Cork> Chuguniy: same with the animations that needs to call another command when they'r done
[12:21:19] <Cork> ?.animate
[12:21:20] <bot-t> .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[12:21:28] <Cork> [complete] <--
[12:22:16] <Chuguniy> Cork: Thank you, will read all the info and try to make it.
[12:22:56] <Cork> Chuguniy: to be a little more technical; animations needs to use events (timer events or animation evens or similar)
[12:23:15] <Cork> Chuguniy: that means they execute semi async
[12:23:37] <Cork> so an animation won't ever do any animation until the function you queue it in has ended
[12:23:52] <Cork> everything that happens sync in the function will ALWAYS have ended first
[12:26:37] <Chuguniy> Cork: ok, will look into that.
[12:38:59] <Heather_> whats the most convenient way to display content of variables etc in jquery? In PHP we have var_dump($var);
[12:39:57] <wachpwnski> Heather_:  that's a good one. console.log()
[12:40:43] <Gho5t> console.dir() in chrome
[12:41:29] <Gho5t> (in addition to console.log)
[12:42:48] <Heather_> does either of them require to be in some sort of function or can it be seperate? and where in the browser does it show? Like to know what to expect before trying
[12:43:04] <NoiseEee> console.log works anytime.
[12:43:13] <NoiseEee> what you choose to send to it depends on scope, natch
[12:43:29] <Heather_> okay

[12:43:53] <tw2113> would jquery/js be able to remove target attributes? :D
[12:44:52] <Trisox> hellow

[12:46:28] <jetsaredim> is there a way to set a collapsible accordion widget to all collapsed
[12:46:33] <Eviltwin> jacoluta: Change setInterval... to timer = setTimeout..., add clearTmeout(timer) before that line but inside the if, add var timer; before line 1
[12:46:38] <defaultro_> form.find("select[name='dir']").hasClass(".wdt").val()?
[12:46:41] <defaultro_> Is that correct?
[12:46:43] <Trisox> on mouse over they do get used
[12:46:54] <Eviltwin> defaultro_: No
[12:47:01] <defaultro_> oh
[12:47:21] <Eviltwin> Are you looking for <select name="dir" class="wdt">?
[12:47:25] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/AeyMN/7/
[12:47:26] <defaultro_> yes
[12:48:00] <defaultro_> there are  <select name="dir" class="xhg">  too
[12:48:01] <Eviltwin> Try form.find("select.wdt[name='dir']")
[12:48:11] <defaultro_> but I don't want xhg
[12:48:38] <Trisox> tw2113: can you take a look
[12:48:38] <Trisox> ?
[12:49:05] <defaultro_> Eviltwin: That's what I am using. That's how I found out we have multiple name="dir"
[12:49:13] <defaultro_> but I donly need wdt value
[12:49:24] <jacoluta> Eviltwin: i want to continue to happend tho while Mx < document.width - 50

[12:53:12] <defaultro_> how can I reference exactly to class=wdt
[12:53:27] <defaultro_> what is wrong with this? form.find("select[name='dir']").hasClass(".wdt").val()
[12:53:34] <Eviltwin> defaultro_: http://api.jquery.com/class-selector/
[12:53:45] <Eviltwin> defaultro_: see ?hasClass
[12:53:45] <bot-t> defaultro_, .hasClass(className): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[12:53:55] <Eviltwin> It takes a class name (no .) and returns true or false
[12:53:59] <Eviltwin> Which does not have a .val() method
[12:54:06] <lahwran> how would I filter a query based on whether elements have an attribute equal to something?
[12:54:06] <defaultro_> got it
[12:54:12] <lahwran> where that something is in a variable
[12:54:52] <lahwran> that is, I would want to do $("... .x[something='" + variable + "']')
[12:55:00] <defaultro_> this should work then, form.find("select[name='dir']").(".wdt").val(), correct?
[12:55:00] <lahwran> but that won't work because of escaping
[12:55:25] <Gho5t>  form.find("select[name='dir'] .wdt").val() = correct
[12:55:39] <defaultro_> wow, :D
[12:55:53] <defaultro_> so it needs to be inside inside the same space
[12:56:06] <lahwran> thoughts?
[12:56:07] <defaultro_> thanks a lot!!!
[12:56:09] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ defaultro_
[12:56:10] <bot-t> defaultro_, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[12:56:16] <Gho5t> $(..select whatever is in here...)
[12:56:16] <Trisox> stupid!!!
[12:56:18] <Trisox> omg
[12:58:48] <jaystar42> hey all, I think I found a bug with the .index() method
[12:59:00] <lahwran> anyone?
[12:59:03] <lahwran> :<
[12:59:22] <ajpiano> jaystar42: if you think you have a jquery bug, please supply a test case on jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com
[12:59:25] <ajpiano> so that someone can diagnose it
[12:59:28] <jaystar42> yup: http://jsfiddle.net/eHFuD/
[12:59:32] <ajpiano> awesome
[13:00:00] <jaystar42> seems index() without params can sometimes return a 1-based index instead of 0-based
[13:00:23] <jaystar42> the jsfiddle i pasted is one such case
[13:00:33] <ajpiano> i don't think that's what's going on here
[13:00:56] <ajpiano> but i may be wrong
[13:00:59] <jedimind> yeah thats not it at al, you're getting an element index without specifying scope
[13:01:12] <jedimind> so $(this).index is jut an index of ALL elements, including the span at the top
[13:01:23] <ajpiano> yeah
[13:01:24] <ajpiano> ^^
[13:01:32] <ajpiano> index with no args is index among its siblings
[13:01:32] <jedimind> http://jsfiddle.net/eHFuD/1/
[13:01:33] <jedimind> see
[13:01:43] <ajpiano> not index amongst siblings-of-same-tag
[13:01:44] <ajpiano> :)
[13:02:06] <jedimind> yay i got something right!
[13:02:08] <ajpiano> jaystar42: but good on you for coming and checking here first before filing and having a testcase ready to go :)
[13:02:40] <jaystar42> so it doesnt matter that $(this) refers to a div element?
[13:02:41] <jedimind> especially keeping with the styling of all jquery testcases :)
[13:02:44] <Eviltwin> jaystar42: http://jsfiddle.net/eHFuD/2/
[13:02:46] <Eviltwin> jaystar42: Correct
[13:02:54] <Eviltwin> It's the index within the parent element
[13:03:00] <jaystar42> thats silly.
[13:03:04] <Eviltwin> No, it's not
[13:03:07] <ajpiano> how is it silly, it's exactly what the docs say
[13:03:27] <ajpiano> also, how could what you're be proposing be done feasibly
[13:03:30] <Trisox> hey ajpiano
[13:03:46] <ajpiano> any time you pass a dom element, figure out every one of its characteristics, and then find its index among the siblings that matches those characteristics
[13:03:56] <Eviltwin> It's far more reasonable than to insist it be the index within the elements of that tag name within the parent
[13:04:09] <jedimind> my brain hurts, ive had to code a pretty complex UI in like 48 hours
[13:05:02] <Eviltwin> You can use $(elem).parent().children("div").index(elem)
[13:05:26] <Eviltwin> And $(parent).children("div").eq(index) to do what you're trying to do
[13:05:48] <Eviltwin> Or $(elem).prevAll("div").length
[13:05:53] <Eviltwin> That might actually be faster
[13:06:49] <ajpiano> i would do it like this http://jsfiddle.net/eHFuD/4/
[13:07:02] <Eviltwin> Fine, do it the fast way
[13:07:28] <jaystar42> i find it silly that $(this)'s siblings can be of any 'type' instead of the same 'type' (div)
[13:07:42] <Eviltwin> jaystar42: Then you don't understand how the DOM works
[13:07:49] <jaystar42> i do
[13:07:50] <Eviltwin> All of this is document
[13:07:53] <jaystar42> i just think its silly
[13:07:55] <Eviltwin> You've added unreasonable assumptions
[13:08:08] <ajpiano> jaystar42: that's like saying you think it's silly that my sister is my sibling even though i'm a dude
[13:08:08] <jaystar42> i do that often it seems
[13:08:15] <Eviltwin> Children of an element can be heterogeneous
[13:08:18] <ajpiano> siblings means one thing, you want it to mean something else
[13:08:37] <jaystar42> ok, instead of siblings, i should be using a different descriptor
[13:08:46] <ajpiano> jaystar42: right
[13:08:47] <jaystar42> semantics ftw
[13:08:54] <ajpiano> that's why set.index( elem ) always works
[13:09:11] <ajpiano> get all the things you want the set to consist of, and ask where in that set the particular element is
[13:09:18] <ajpiano> then they don't have to be siblings or anything
[13:09:24] <someprimetime> ajpiano you still on javascript jabber?
[13:09:38] <ajpiano> wat is javascript jabber, i don't think i've ever been on that
[13:10:08] <Eviltwin> I should go to one of the jQuery conference / meetup things
[13:10:11] <someprimetime> oh woops
[13:10:14] <Eviltwin> Actually meet some of you guys in person
[13:10:18] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: you should commmmmmmmmmme to the dev summit
[13:10:22] <someprimetime> thought your last name was oneal
[13:10:27] <someprimetime> there is a guy named ajoneal on there
[13:10:32] <Eviltwin> No, it's Piano
[13:10:36] <ajpiano> haha
[13:10:37] <someprimetime> never bothered to look him up; assumed it was you
[13:10:43] <someprimetime> it's really piano? hah
[13:10:47] <Eviltwin> Not really
[13:10:47] <ajpiano> no it isn't
[13:10:50] <someprimetime> i thought you just liked playing piano or something
[13:11:07] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: you in NYC?
[13:11:23] <someprimetime> fwiw http://javascriptjabber.com/ is js jabber
[13:11:24] <someprimetime> podcast
[13:11:40] <Eviltwin> Chicago area but will likely be in the Palo Alto / Menlo Park after next summer
[13:11:47] <someprimetime> word
[13:11:51] <someprimetime> i live in oakland but work in SF
[13:11:57] <someprimetime> i'll buy you a beer for all the help you've given me
[13:12:10] <someprimetime> or maybe take you out for dinner and a movie
[13:15:19] <Eviltwin> Hah, .index() uses .prevAll().length
[13:17:27] <jaystar42> ok im outie, thanks for the help and insights
[13:20:34] <jetsaredim> how come when i copy the elements from the default theme's roller page i get the formatting but not the rollover effects
[13:22:21] <rhizmoe> a friend needs a basic programming oriented js tutorial, is resig's khan stuff sufficient?
[13:22:45] <Eviltwin> I usually tell people to see ?learn
[13:22:46] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[13:22:58] <Eviltwin> The first link there points to all different types of tutorials that speak at different levels
[13:23:15] <Eviltwin> Gives you a choice so you can find what works best for you
[13:24:22] <Flam9> When I'm loading data into a div dynamically, sometimes the div won't get a scrollbar
[13:24:33] <Flam9> is there anyway to refresh the height so it knows to put one in?
[13:24:41] <Flam9> I have it set to overflow-y:auto
[13:25:04] <Eviltwin> overflow-y: scroll?
[13:25:30] <Flam9> I don't want it permanently in and even with overflow-y:scroll it wont get the scrolling part
[13:25:44] <Flam9> because it doesnt recognize that the content height > container height
[13:25:52] <Flam9> if it helps, im using jquery ui
[13:26:22] <Eviltwin> Is it being loaded into a jQuery UI widget?
[13:27:17] <Flam9> yes into ui-layout-center
[13:27:20] <Flam9> and then into #tabs
[13:27:37] <Flam9> basically its the tab panel on tab click
[13:27:53] <Flam9> tab panel data gets loaded in but it doesnt recognize the height inconsistency
[13:29:36] <Flam9> Is there some method to just redetect the height?  I'm thinking of doing $('.panel').height(  $('.panel).height() )
[13:29:37] <Flam9> lol
[13:30:07] <Eviltwin> What happens if you make it switch to a different tab and back?
[13:30:17] <Flam9> it fixed
[13:30:19] <Flam9> fixes*
[13:31:02] <Flam9> I think its because i modded show/hide code (which was messing with map events) to position:absolute; left:-10000px.  So when a tab is brought back in it's not like show() in which things are recalculated
[13:31:24] <Eviltwin> Oh
[13:31:28] <Eviltwin> Try .tabs("refresh")
[13:32:41] <Flam9> No such method refresh for tabs widget instance..
[13:33:28] <Eviltwin> Maybe I'm looking at old code then
[13:33:37] <Flam9> http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#method-widget
[13:33:52] <talntid> Anyone familiar with this plugin? http://tinyurl.com/jquerymodifier
[13:34:42] <Eviltwin> Yeah, I was looking at jquery.ui.tabs.js from jQuery UI 1.9pre
[13:34:48] <Flam9> ah
[13:35:11] <Flam9> I was using that previously but it has content duplication issues
[13:35:17] <Flam9> when you ajax load content into tabs
[13:35:30] <Eviltwin> I'm mostly okay with the blackboxness of jQuery (although I still poke at the source sometimes) but I just can't stand it for jQuery UI
[13:35:39] <Eviltwin> I always turn to the source to see what's going on
[13:36:19] <Flam9> I feel the same way.  This company I just started working for is already in too deep with jquery ui so I'm struggling to do whatever I can lol
[13:36:43] <Eviltwin> Well, I would look at jquery.ui.tabs.js from the unminified source
[13:36:53] <Eviltwin> And see what's going on with the height
[13:37:25] <Flam9> I guess that's my last option now, thx
[13:43:05] <New0> hi everyone, is there a UI framework to style css with cross-browser compatibility?
[13:43:22] <Eviltwin> CSS is style
[13:44:01] <New0> browsers (IE 6/7/8, Firefox 2/3, Opara 9, Safari and Chrome)
[13:44:18] <Eviltwin> Dear God, why IE 6?
[13:44:31] <New0> well my job require that
[13:44:37] <Eviltwin> Everyone is or has deprecated it
[13:44:44] <Eviltwin> Including Microsoft
[13:44:47] <Gho5t> yeah
[13:44:55] <Gho5t> you should really rethink that
[13:45:05] <Gho5t> that is an added cost
[13:45:11] <New0> and i know it's style. but i am sure that is a UI frame work with jQuery
[13:45:23] <Eviltwin> Welcome to jQuery UI
[13:45:26] <Eviltwin> jqueryui.com
[13:45:28] <Gho5t> for widgets
[13:45:31] <Gho5t> not layout
[13:45:34] <New0> what is added cost?
[13:45:45] <Gho5t> browser hacking for ie 6
[13:45:56] <New0> Eviltwin, tnx. didn't know there is such a channel
[13:45:56] <Gho5t> most ppl do IE 8+ nowadays
[13:46:20] <Flam> New0: Maybe you mean a CSS framework, like twitter's bootstrap or 37signals foundation
[13:46:38] <jedimind> 37signals foundation?
[13:46:39] <New0> Flam, maybe
[13:46:54] <jedimind> you mean zurb's foundation ?
[13:46:54] <Flam> sorry Zurb**
[13:46:57] <Flam> Not 37signal woops
[13:47:00] <New0> i just want to use some framework that i can do style cross-platform
[13:47:44] <Flam> New0: There are a lot of things to aleviate the struggle of making things cross-browser, but no fool proof method.
[13:48:25] <New0> Flam, ok, maybe i will just try the simple way :)
[13:48:29] <New0> Thank all anyway :)
[13:48:37] <Flam> I recommend you at least use LESS or SASS
[13:48:54] <Flam> so you can write mixins (small chunks of code that can be reused anywhere)
[13:49:02] <Flam> so you dont have to keep re-typing all the vendor prefixes
[13:49:19] <Flam> It has other benefits too
[13:49:36] <Flam> Sass + foundation is my CSS utility belt :P
[13:50:24] <Gho5t> yes SASS and LESS rock
[13:50:33] <Gho5t> hard to go back after
[13:50:49] <starsinmypockets> http://www.jubileeschool.net/ Anyone know why the page shifts when Projects & Activities is highlighted
[13:53:08] <Chuguniy> How to triger .animate() besides puting it into .click()?
[13:54:43] <Chuguniy> For example I need to animate some div when the function is called (animate code is in this function).
[13:56:35] <zsoc> Chuguniy: .when() ?
[13:57:03] <Flam> starsinmypockets: doesn't shift for me..
[13:57:22] <Flam> ctrl+f5 the page
[13:59:26] <starsinmypockets> Flam - tx.. what does ctrl+f5 do?
[13:59:44] <MistuhKurtz> force refreshes
[14:00:00] <MistuhKurtz> you can also do ctrl+shift+r or cmd+shift+r in any browser besides IE
[14:03:50] <Chuguniy> I got this code http://pastebin.com/neu29bvj if I use .css() instead of .animate() everithing is working.
[14:06:09] <timforgach> Has anyone used multiDatesPicker? I am trying to customize it and having issues.
[14:07:06] <zsoc> chuckhar_, http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[14:07:43] <chuckhar_> Chuguniy: ^^ meant for you
[14:08:19] <Chuguniy> yes, I understood ;)
[14:08:27] <Heather_> question: what does it mean when firebug says an img status is : "304 not modified"? Im having problem using these with jquery functions.
[14:09:15] <chuckhar_> Heather_: it's an HTTP status that means that the asset (img, js, css, etc) hasn't changed since the browser downloaded it, so it can use the cached version rather than redownload the entire file again
[14:09:20] <zsoc> Heather_, Nothing really
[14:09:26] <Heather_> okay
[14:09:31] <zsoc> right, what he said, heh. it's not an error
[14:09:42] <chuckhar_> Heather_: see section 10.3.5 here: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html
[14:10:14] <Heather_> Is there anything that could be wrong except my js if an img does not trigger a function? Tripple checked html tags.
[14:10:20] <Heather_> with the image
[14:10:33] <NoiseEee> and img trigger a function?
[14:10:37] <NoiseEee> s/and/an?
[14:11:16] <Heather_> an
[14:11:22] <Heather_> image*
[14:11:33] <zsoc> try again lol
[14:11:55] <Heather_> if a function is not triggered by clicking an image
[14:12:25] <NoiseEee> ?debug
[14:12:26] <bot-t> Firebug: http://www.getfirebug.com/ or Firebug Lite (for non-firefox browsers): http://www.getfirebug.com/lite.html plus Debug: http://benalman.com/projects/javascript-debug-console-log/
[14:12:40] <zsoc> also the element inspector built into chrome is nice
[14:12:43] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ Heather_
[14:15:05] <someprimetime> i won't use SASS until it stops being dependent on ruby
[14:17:14] <Eviltwin> https://github.com/visionmedia/sass.js/
[14:19:41] <MistuhKurtz> Is SASS usually compiled at run-time or on deployment someprimetime, Eviltwin?
[14:21:39] <Eviltwin> MistuhKurtz: Usually compiled when you change it
[14:21:47] <Eviltwin> So it only has to be compiled once
[14:21:52] <MistuhKurtz> ah okay
[14:23:36] <MistuhKurtz> so the ruby dependency isn't a huge deal...still inconvenient though.
[14:27:36] <Aristata> $('.tagged-resources table .option input.custom_role').length is returning 4, but when I try and do $('.tagged-resources table .option input.custom_role').each only one input os being iterated through, what am I doing wrong?
[14:28:06] <Eviltwin> No idea, make a jsfiddle
[14:28:22] <Aristata> This is a little too meta for that unfortunantly
[14:28:49] <Eviltwin> If you can't reproduce a problem, we can't help you
[14:29:07] <Eviltwin> If you can't isolate it, it would take a lot more effort for us to help you and so we're less likely to
[14:34:24] <someprimetime> MistuhKurtz: precompiled and usually minified
[14:34:49] <someprimetime> although LESS has some sort of compile on the fly thing i believe that compiles in the users' browser which is retarded
[14:52:23] <michaelb> hey, can't find solutions on google and dont know if this is a good channel to ask, but on webkit for some reason when I use "-webkit-user-select: none" to disable selection on a large DOM, many events (such as .mousemove) get extremely slowed down. firefox works fine. Any ideas?
[15:17:22] <FunnyLookinHat> Anyone here used ezpz hint?  https://github.com/enriquez/ezpz-hint ?  Having trouble getting fields to double check if they're not blank after changing them with .val()
[15:17:49] <FunnyLookinHat> I had tried using a loop with .focus().blur()
[15:20:54] <diverdude> i use twitter bootstrap to attach a js like this: <a class="help-block collapseblock" data-target="#albumpwdpholderedt" data-toggle="collapse" href="#">text</a> <div id="albumpwdpholderedt" class="collapse">...</div> I need to react on shown and hidden events. How do i attach those to my collapsable element?
[15:33:27] <diverdude> i use twitter bootstrap to attach a js like this: <a class="help-block collapseblock" data-target="#albumpwdpholderedt" data-toggle="collapse" href="#">text</a> <div id="albumpwdpholderedt" class="collapse">...</div> I need to react on shown and hidden events.

[15:38:23] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[15:38:37] <coldhead> good morning telstra user
[15:38:37] <b-ot> coldhead, you have one new message, say “read” to me when you wish to read it.
[16:13:31] <triptec> hi, I'm trying different ways to simpleify my ajax handling and stuff, I'd like some input on this http://pastebin.com/iSjqHHnN
[16:22:53] <eliransapir> anyone used apptopia.com before to sell their app?
[16:23:54] <gaxar77> Hey guys!
[16:24:52] <gaxar77> I was wondering, what are the advantages of using the GUI elements from jQuery (I think there is a plugin or something)?
[16:25:11] <coldhead> triptec: i don't see an easy way to simplify this. this.dataData is awkwardly named but that's about all i got
[16:25:26] <coldhead> gaxar77: as opposed to using what?
[16:26:14] <coldhead> the advantage to using them versus writing your own equiavlents from scratch is that it saves you time and testing
[16:26:54] <gaxar77> Yeah. My only problem is that when I choose not to reinvent the wheel I feel kind of cheap and lazy and less acomplished.
[16:27:12] <gaxar77> But I was really just wonderring how you place the ui elements on the page.
[16:27:21] <coldhead> bollocks to that, gaxar77
[16:27:22] <triptec> coldhead: yeah some of the naming is almost stupid, but is there any other cleaner way to do this? or du you maybe know of a lib that works something like it?
[16:27:31] <coldhead> invent new and better and previously uninvented wheels
[16:27:35] <coldhead> the old wheels are boring
[16:27:41] <rgr> whats the syntax to access an object field where the field name is in a string variable
[16:27:41] <gaxar77> yeah, that's true.
[16:27:57] <silverwind> rgr:Like an array
[16:28:26] <coldhead> triptec: i'm not sure i follow, you have this in a few dozen lines of code already
[16:28:34] <coldhead> i'd be very pleased with myself if this works
[16:28:39] <coldhead> and i'd get on with my life
[16:28:47] <rgr> oh ffs, of course. I had the wrong name in the var... lol. sorry.
[16:31:41] <triptec> coldhead: well it's not very complete, but the thing where I can set the event type and url and stuff in the html is what I'm after since I hate having a lot of different $().click().change() etc in my js for every input that has ajax
[16:32:17] <coldhead> i see how it works, triptec
[16:32:28] <coldhead> i haven't seen any libs that do similarly
[16:32:35] <coldhead> let you specify event types in the markup
[16:32:37] <coldhead> it's interesting
[16:33:04] <coldhead> if you blur your eyes it's kind of getting back to onclick="javascript:..."
[16:33:15] <coldhead> except the actual behaviour is still separated
[16:33:59] <triptec> yeah, but if I use that my colleagues will hit me with a bat
[16:34:13] <coldhead> do they have any better ideas?
[16:34:34] <coldhead> ajpiano: you know of anything like this http://pastebin.com/iSjqHHnN ?
[16:34:52] <silverwind> triptec: You should be using forms..
[16:35:09] <coldhead> :D
[16:35:09] <triptec> have it in the js but I hate that so I was hoping someone had done something like this before
[16:35:10] <silverwind> triptec: That would make your code a bit cleaner.
[16:37:04] <gaxar77> Okay, so I am guessing that with the jQuery UI, you put certain kinds of elements on the page, and then you bring them to life by calling a jQuery function, correct?
[16:37:05] <triptec> silverwind: the problem with that is i use yii and their form classes and I haven't found a simple way to add the data to input fields
[16:37:22] <coldhead> that's about right, gaxar77
[16:37:32] <gaxar77> That's cool.
[16:37:41] <coldhead> check out the jQuery UI demos
[16:37:46] <gaxar77> I am.
[16:37:49] <gaxar77> They are cool.
[16:37:50] <coldhead> you can see the look and the feel and source
[16:37:58] <coldhead> and the possombilities
[16:38:06] <silverwind> triptec: I see
[16:40:19] <Heather_> could someone help me understand what went wrong here: http://pastebin.com/9Rfyfuiu
[16:41:27] <silverwind> Heather_: The server returns an error.. could be because of you... or the server.
[16:41:34] <silverwind> Heather_: Check the status code.
[16:42:49] <silverwind> Heather_: Basically, the server sent back a html response and the JSON parser tried to parse it... and since it cannot, you got an exception
[16:43:05] <Heather_> okay got it ty
[16:50:56] <grantg> http://i.imgur.com/f44m3.png just fucking happened
[16:52:27] <grantg> Everybody out, the internet is over. The Secret Service have to search every nook and cranny for the fucker who did this.
[17:01:56] <coldhead> thanks for stopping by, grantg, really enjoyed your input
[17:02:07] <catcher> ha
[17:02:20] <gaxar77> So, if I change the html content dynamically while jQuery is treating it as a widget, will the whole thing continue to function as expected?
[17:03:32] <coldhead> depends on what exactly you change
[17:03:36] <coldhead> it's usually one of those
[17:03:37] <coldhead> ?tias
[17:03:38] <bot-t> Try It And See
[17:03:40] <coldhead> scenarios
[17:04:14] <gaxar77> oh ok
[17:52:35] <gpraysman> Hey guys - have any of you ever used Apptopia to sell you mobile app(s)?
[17:57:49] <gpraysman> Also, if you were to sell a mobile app, what platform would you use? Or would you broker the deal yourself with the a potential buyer?
[17:58:46] <coldhead> if i went to the trouble of making an app i would release it for free so as many people could enjoy it as possible
[17:58:57] <coldhead> but that's not likely to happen because i am very old and tired
[18:07:57] <gaxar77> Hmm, it doesn't really look like jQuery has a lot of UI elements.
[18:13:16] <ibodi> http://jsfiddle.net/5tSzM/6/
[18:13:27] <ibodi> it always shows correct on above.
[18:13:52] <ibodi> however in my local, sometime shows 00002 ; sometimes shows correct. i m not sure what's going on
[18:14:17] <MistuhKurtz> gaxar77, perhaps the jQuery UI library would be what you're looking for? :)
[18:14:22] <ibodi> if uncomment //if (s==...) line, always shows correct result. a
[18:14:25] <ibodi> any idea ?
[18:14:40] <coldhead> ibodi: http://jsfiddle.net/5tSzM/7/
[18:14:46] <sunbeam> any ideas why article:last-child doesn't work?
[18:14:49] <sunbeam> while last-child works on any other element?
[18:14:54] <coldhead> you can't do default arguments in JS like that
[18:15:01] <wookiehangover> ibodi: listen to coldhead
[18:15:09] <wookiehangover> cause I was just typing that
[18:15:13] <wookiehangover> this isn't ruby
[18:15:54] <ibodi> coldhead: u r genius. however my original header == pad0(s,len=3)
[18:16:10] <ibodi> ok i m testing again ...
[18:16:12] <snover> wookiehangover: really, ruby is the go-to language you picked for default parameters? :P
[18:16:28] <coldhead> this isn't perl6
[18:16:34] <coldhead> this is sparta
[18:17:05] <coldhead> sunbeam: do you have a test case for that? it sounds interetesting
[18:17:20] <wookiehangover> snover: yes, cause its like the one other language I write consistently and it has that
[18:17:22] <wookiehangover> what of it
[18:19:08] <ibodi> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/5tSzM/8/
[18:19:16] <ibodi> coldhead: could u pls fix again ?
[18:19:52] <Heather_> Not a good idea writing html tags inside php files is it? Seems like the php iterations I cause problem with javascript. Only the html tags that are in the first iteration are affected by javascript. What the best approach to this? I like using loops to display e.g images with same options but different src attr.
[18:20:26] <ibodi> coldhead: in my local, if i uncommend //if (s==... it will be always correct.
[18:20:44] <ibodi> coldhead: otherwise, sometimes return 5 digit, sometime return 6 digits
[18:21:42] <cheesypoof20> Ever since v1.8 I always see "Unknown property 'box-sizing'.  Declaration dropped." in Firefox console. It's not in my CSS, so it's because of jQuery. Anyone have an explanation for this, or if I should report as a bug.
[18:22:10] <snover> you should definitely not report it as a bug because it is not a bug.
[18:22:11] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/5tSzM/10/
[18:23:23] <ibodi> coldhead: yeah. jsfiddle.net always correct. i might rewrite pad0 using loop... in a sec..
[18:24:19] <cheesypoof20> well atleast explain your reasoning...
[18:24:52] <ibodi> coldhead: cool! sound like fixed. by: if (!len) len=3 :)
[18:25:28] <ibodi> coldhead: thanks again. saved handful of my hair from losing .
[18:26:25] <jetsaredim> if i'm loading content into a tab via ajax, would it be possible to use an accordian inside that page?
[18:28:45] <ibodi> coldhead: so enc(str='',key='') need to be: enc(str,key) ?
[18:29:40] <ibodi> enc(str='',key=''){...}
[18:33:10] <coldhead> you have to test for undefined vars inside the function, ibodi
[18:33:14] <coldhead> and assign defaults yourself
[18:33:16] <coldhead> manually
[18:33:18] <coldhead> like a cave man
[18:33:20] <coldhead> i am sorry
[18:34:00] <ibodi> coldhead: ok. thanks
[18:58:54] <gaxar77> No I mean the jQuery UI library demo doesn't seem to show a lot of widgets.
[19:49:49] <ibodi> a='018'; b=20; how to make a+b = 38 ?
[19:50:26] <ibodi> parseInt seems not working in this case ?
[19:51:11] <ibodi> solved. parserInt(a,10) works now.
[19:51:16] <coldhead> bam!
[19:51:22] <coldhead> good work
[19:51:40] <ibodi> wow. i m really newbie to js. coldhead
[19:53:25] <coldhead> and JS isn't exactly coming to meet you half way
[19:53:40] <coldhead> that aspect of parseInt is not obvious
[19:53:59] <coldhead> you should use jshint to help you find you way around, ibodi
[19:56:24] <ibodi> coldhead: thanks. sometime use var, sometime without var also work. what is good way ? var a=1 ; or just a=1?
[19:56:47] <coldhead> always always always use var
[19:56:58] <coldhead> you can only not use var when you know exactly what you are doing
[19:57:06] <coldhead> and even then people will probably beat the crap out of you
[19:57:11] <coldhead> don't make those people angry
[19:57:14] <coldhead> var all the things
[19:58:02] <ibodi> oh. i thought only postgreSQL guys are over strict.
[19:58:18] * CmdrTallen agrees with coldhead
[19:58:19] <ibodi> ok i will add var when it is var.
[19:59:30] <coldhead> without var it becomes a global variable
[19:59:44] <coldhead> global variables did 9/11
[20:00:18] <tw2113> :O
[20:00:36] <ibodi> ha.. that's interesting. now i know how to make a global var. :D
[20:00:49] <tw2113> or how not to
[20:01:18] <ibodi> as i m just going to ask howto: swap(&a,&b){...}
[20:02:23] <ibodi> coldhead: wow. thanks again. i got many variables same name. that's scaring. im going to add var to all of them when need.
[20:03:24] <ibodi> coldhead: but within a function(){ a=2} should no hard outside that function ?
[20:03:36] <ibodi> no harm*
[20:06:14] <ibodi> coldhead: tested. has harm.
[20:08:28] <diverdude> I have this piece of code: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/344508412 but i really don't understand how line 7 and 10 are working. It seems its just a && operator performed on a variable and the result of some jquery-stuff which is not used for anything. But if i comment out the 2 lines the code does not work as expected. So how are those 2 lines supposed to be read?
[20:15:35] <Blaster> hey how do you turn off an event then turn it back on with the same handler that it was originally turned on with?
[20:16:27] <roasbeef> diverdude: looks like it gets the text stored in the data-on-hidden/active, then checks that it isn't blank and if so sets the text for the collapsible to that value
[20:22:25] <_zoggy_> roasbeef, yes
[20:23:39] <ibodi> coldhead: is this valid string: var str='.{}[]()@#$%&!?|=*+~^`:;,';
[20:24:24] <ibodi> coldhead: do i need to backslash any char in above string ?
[20:25:45] <_zoggy_> ...
[20:26:50] <Eviltwin> Blaster: var disabledEvents = {}; function disableEvent(type) { disabledEvents[type] = true; } function enableEvent(type) { disabledEvents[type] = false; } function disablable(fn) { return function(e) { if(disabledEvents[e.type]) return; fn.apply(this, arguments); } $(".foo").on("click blur", function() { ... });
[20:27:26] <Blaster> Eviltwin: Thank you but I was hoping for something a tad more elegant,
[20:27:28] <Eviltwin> Err $(".foo").on("click blur", disablable(function() { ... }));
[20:28:45] <Blaster> Can't I use a combination of on/off to enable and disable handlers?
[20:31:00] <Eviltwin> Blaster: What's the usecase?
[20:31:02] <Eviltwin> Why are you trying to do this?
[20:31:56] <jetsaredim> is there a way to cache the open tab when using the tab widget?
[20:32:05] <Blaster> i linked up left and right arrow keys to simply click my pagination buttons (next and prev page) but if I hold down one of the arrow keys it creates a loop rather than scrolling several pages
[20:32:21] <Blaster> that might not be clear enough for you tho
[20:33:01] <Blaster> it's like I need to turn off the keydown event until the next page has loaded by AJAX and then reenable it
[20:33:39] <Blaster> I guess I should maybe just do on() and off() and put the handler inside a function
[20:34:23] <Eviltwin> It's faster to use an if(...) return; in your handler than use .on() and .off() if the number of times you want to attach and detach it is high
[20:34:27] <Eviltwin> Which it sounds like it is
[20:34:45] <Eviltwin> Since you basically want to .off() every time the event fires and then some time later .on() again
[20:35:26] <Blaster> so you mean set some sort of var to true and then check that it's true, then set to false after event has fired?
[20:35:40] <Blaster> or something like that, might not have said it right
[20:35:45] <Blaster> but I think I get the premise
[20:39:19] <Blaster> when you use $(elem).click();  to fire a click event on that element, is there a way to have a callback, or should you just use the next line in your code?
[20:39:34] <Eviltwin> To have a callback for what?
[20:40:59] <Blaster> once the event has been clicked I guess
[20:41:09] <Eviltwin> ??
[20:41:17] <Eviltwin> Events can't be clicked
[20:41:22] <Blaster> once the event has been fired
[20:41:30] <Blaster> i guess it's fired immediately
[20:41:35] <Blaster> sorry i'm confused haha
[20:46:17] <Blaster> i sorted out my issue, worked great
[20:46:22] <Blaster> thanks for the tips
[20:56:43] <coldhead> ?eval '.{}[]()@#$%&!?|=*+~^`:;,';
[20:56:43] <bot-t> Cannot send to #$%&!?|=*+~^`:;,';.
[20:56:50] <coldhead> interesting
[20:57:01] <coldhead> ?eval '.{}[]()@#$%&!?\|=*+~^`:;,';
[20:57:01] <bot-t> Cannot send to #$%&!?\|=*+~^`:;,';.
[20:57:02] <ibodi> coldhead: i tested . this string is js safe.
[20:57:10] <coldhead> it breaks bot-t
[20:57:14] <ibodi> ha
[20:57:27] <Eviltwin> ibodi: Between '' you can use any character that is not \ or ' and get the literal representation
[20:57:33] <Eviltwin> If you want a ' you need to do \'
[20:57:44] <Eviltwin> Same hold for "" with \ and "
[20:58:06] <ibodi> yeah. i had 88 chars except ' " < > / \
[20:58:10] <ibodi> so it is safe
[21:07:18] <roasbeef> yeee hawww just finished the tuts plus jQuery tutorial, feeling like I just got some new boots
[21:09:08] <coldhead> happy new boots, roasbeef
[21:31:13] <tash> i'd like to add the values of  a column in my html table, but there are many td's
[21:31:38] <howardgrigg> hi guys - I am using .sortable to allow drag and drop on a ul - is there a way that I can have a button on each li that sends it to the top?
[21:32:09] <shoky> howardgrigg: most def
[21:32:59] <howardgrigg> i figure each li would have a div that runs the function when clicked but I'm just not sure what function that would be
[21:33:53] <tash> shoky: I can do a foreach ( .each ) on all the td's in a table right? Like $( '#table-id td' ).each(function() {}); right?
[21:34:52] <shoky> howardgrigg:  something like..  $(this).prependTo('ul')
[21:34:53] <Gabriel> anyone figured how to validate select fields generated by chzn-select ?
[21:35:13] <shoky> howardgrigg: or maybe $(this).closest('li').prependTo('#theList')  or whatever
[21:35:50] <shoky> tash: ey
[21:35:51] <shoky> ye
[21:36:07] <howardgrigg> shoky, ill give it a go
[21:36:19] <tash> shoky: strange, didn't seem to work ...
[21:36:36] <shoky> didn't? and now?
[21:37:30] <tash> this should log to the console "X" as many times as there are <td>'s right? http://pastie.org/4672087
[21:37:35] <tash> nothing logs to the console at all.
[21:38:23] <shoky> that should work yes, if the selector fits the current DOM.
[21:39:13] <shoky> but why all these 'should', just make a fiddle :\
[21:39:59] <amccloud> is there a way to get the height of an element including the box-shadow
[21:40:15] <howardgrigg> shoky, worked perfectly :)
[21:40:26] <tw2113> worked for me tash
[21:40:35] <tash> strange ..
[21:40:38] <tash> i'll tinker some more
[21:40:44] <tw2113> http://jsbin.com/erihoc/1/edit
[21:41:21] <ibodi> coldhead: how do u feel about js ? i just built a function works perfect, all correct result. however since i tested with special chars, then it works only when special char is presented.
[21:42:14] <ibodi> coldhead: it returns error when it tested with : func('abc') --- cashed somewhere ?
[21:42:22] <ibodi> cached.
[21:43:00] <ibodi> coldhead: however it always works with special chars eg func('abc 中 xyz etc')
[21:43:12] <coldhead> that's really weird, ibodi
[21:43:18] <coldhead> it works great in my imagination
[21:43:24] <coldhead> do you have the code somewhere we can look?
[21:43:35] <ibodi> coldhead: yeah. where should i upload ?
[21:43:50] <shoky> intarwebz
[21:44:18] <tw2113> my brain
[21:44:35] <coldhead> can you put it on jsfiddle?
[21:44:38] <shoky> bbbrrr a in zzzznz
[21:44:38] <coldhead> that's been good to us so far
[21:44:45] <ibodi> coldhead: ok let me have a try ...
[21:45:13] <tw2113> i need to figure out why Firefox Aurora is constantly giving me "a is undefined" errors in console
[21:45:57] <coldhead> window.a = true && 'case closed';
[21:48:12] <ibodi> coldhead: is it a good idea? i created a js.encrypt() and use php to decrypt. so you need php files as well.
[21:48:31] <coldhead> we don't care about the php stuff
[21:48:35] <coldhead> and can't help anyway
[21:48:48] <tw2113> peeachepee?
[21:49:00] <coldhead> peeHAYCHpee
[21:49:13] <ibodi> coldhead: ok i upload .js. and maybe you can have a look. 196 lines .too big ?
[21:49:41] <tw2113> haych? what are you? redneck?
[21:49:49] <tw2113> good ole southern boy?
[21:49:55] <tw2113> oh wait, you're new here
[21:50:19] <tw2113> i can forgive you?.this time
[21:51:31] <ibodi> coldhead:  md5.js was downloaded from someone else. pretty mature and correct.
[21:52:52] <coldhead> i never actually say the letter H out loud
[21:52:54] <coldhead> so we're safe
[21:55:03] <ibodi> coldhead: would it because i put too many "var" ? it was working beautifully.
[21:56:48] <tw2113> i should probably get to work on some stuff that i have due as "beta" tomorrow
[21:56:52] <coldhead> ibodi: maybe!
[21:57:05] <coldhead> you only need to use var the first time you mention a variable
[21:57:14] <coldhead> then it is local from that point onwards
[21:57:24] <ibodi> coldhead: ok i m going to have a double check ..
[21:57:29] <coldhead> this is too much code for me to debug, ibodi
[21:57:34] <coldhead> i am heavily pregnant at the moment
[21:57:56] <ibodi> coldhead: yeah. u r right . i m going to debug myself.
[21:58:48] <coldhead> good luck ibodi
[21:58:59] <coldhead> you might like to feed the code to jshint to see if it finds any bugs
[21:59:12] <ibodi> ok
[22:32:26] <Guest79085> Hello does anyknow how to make somehting like, when sombady leaves a comment as a link, and if i try to hover over the link it would display the preview for that link as image ?
[22:57:29] <ibodi> coldhead: ok fixed. because i forgot to put this line in html file: <meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html; charset=utf-8'>
[22:58:00] <ibodi> coldhead: sometime a small issue take time to debug -- happily i guessed right. now work again.
[22:58:26] <coldhead> oh good work, ibodi !
[22:58:31] <coldhead> encoding stuff is hard
[22:59:02] <ibodi> coldhead: i make a php enc by myself. and i translated into js today.
[22:59:07] <ibodi> made*
[22:59:23] <coldhead> that's very cool
[22:59:49] <ibodi> coldhead: i thought u r a big boy! jEE - a girl here.
[23:00:14] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[23:00:34] <ibodi> that's cool2
[23:05:17] <ibodi> coldhead: howto spend the rest of life ?
[23:05:43] <coldhead> just waiting for death i guess
[23:05:48] <Guest79085> ibodi hey
[23:06:25] <Guest79085> coldhead are you busy?
[23:07:59] <shoky> Guest79085 i'm pretty sure you'd need a serverside solution for that
[23:08:40] <ibodi> coldhead: shut up eyes 1 hour a day, and one day you will see a much colourful world inside than outside, better than waiting for death.
[23:09:23] <sjeijk> good morning
[23:09:26] <ibodi> coldhead: you do not need to wait for death. as it always comes after birth.
[23:09:55] <ibodi> coldhead: ok have a great day. thanks again. see u next time - hopefully i m still alive.
[23:16:18] <Guest79085> shoky hmm i see so thats something complicated
[23:19:09] <Eviltwin> I think you'd need something like this: http://www.shrinktheweb.com
[23:20:53] <Guest79085> Eviltwin the thing is, when the user is going to post a comment all the links would be random
[23:21:51] <Guest79085> so i dont know what kind of link somone is going to post
[23:22:13] <Eviltwin> So you'd use an API to generate it on the fly
[23:23:37] <Guest79085> ohh i see now so i would have to use some  kind of third party product in order to make this happen
[23:23:38] <subdesign> whats the diff. scrollTo, localScroll and serialScroll plugins? same author..
[23:26:13] <howardgrigg> hi guys - I'm using preprendTo and appendTo to more li items to the top or bottom of a ul. Is there a way to get them to animate to the top or bottom rather than just instantly change?
[23:26:24] <howardgrigg> *move
[23:26:55] <Cork> howardgrigg: not with those commands
[23:27:27] <Cork> howardgrigg: you would have to grab the position and height of the ul, make the li absolute
[23:27:47] <Cork> animate its position to the new one, then change it back and append/prepend it
[23:28:01] <howardgrigg> ah k
[23:28:18] <howardgrigg> hmm sounds like too much effort lol thanks though
[23:28:48] <Cork> its actually sounds harder then it is
[23:28:54] <Guest79085> ok so this is the jsfiddle, i would like to make the button work outside of the div but it only works when its inside :this button here  <input type="button" class="reply"
[23:29:05] <Guest79085> http://jsfiddle.net/d6KEh/2/
[23:29:55] <Cork> Guest79085: what do you want it to do when its "outside" it?
[23:30:18] <Cork> and how is it positioned if its outside?
[23:31:07] <Guest79085> on load i want to hide the div so there is just the reply button and when the user click on that button it opens
[23:31:10] <Guest79085> but
[23:32:03] <pHero> hello guys, got a lil question, how do i trigger a close event on my datepicker
[23:32:10] <Guest79085> each of them have to work unique, so when the person is choosing that one comment it does not affect others
[23:32:13] <Cork> Guest79085: make an example in the jsfiddle of how the html would look
[23:32:23] <Guest79085> ok Cork
[23:33:17] <Cork> pHero: trigger a close event for an event listner or triggering that the datepicker actually closes?
[23:34:01] <pHero> hmm well
[23:34:13] <sly_> hi jquery
[23:34:19] <pHero> out.println "\$(\"#${name}\").datepicker({"
[23:34:19] <pHero> 		out.println "onClose: function(dateText, inst) {"
[23:34:27] <pHero> i have a function like this on my datepicker
[23:34:50] <Cork> hmm thats even trickier
[23:34:50] <pHero> and would like to trigger that event like
[23:34:58] <pHero> $('#dueDate').trigger('close')
[23:34:59] <Cork> thats not an event listner thats a ui event callback
[23:35:13] <Cork> trigger doesn't know about those
[23:35:20] <pHero> hmm ok
[23:35:33] <pHero> do u have any suggestions
[23:35:50] <Cork> you could save the object and call obj.onClose? :)
[23:36:10] <pHero> how do u mean save the object? o_0
[23:36:15] <sly_> Can something tell me how can I edit the autocomplete positioning
[23:36:16] <pHero> it is created..
[23:37:23] <sly_> When I page is at the button the autocomplete will be hidden I Want to display at top / bottom so that it will be visible at any cost
[23:37:38] <Cork> var obj = { onClose: function(dateText, inst) { } }; $(name).datepicker(obj); obj.onClose('', null)
[23:37:44] <Cork> pHero: ^
[23:38:29] <pHero> Cork thanks ill check that out
[23:38:34] <Cork> pHero: though that said, if you want to trigger datepickers close event try
[23:38:47] <Cork> .datepicker('show').datepicker('hide')
[23:39:04] <pHero> hmm interesting idea
[23:39:05] <Cork> that should trigger it
[23:39:07] <pHero> will do thanks
[23:39:30] <Guest79085> Cork, now when the div is hidden, when the user clicks on the reply it should open that div (but only one) and then if he chossed to open another one it would do the same thing, so each one is kinda unique http://jsfiddle.net/d6KEh/4/
[23:42:38] <Cork> Guest79085: you mean something like http://jsfiddle.net/d6KEh/5/ ?
[23:43:15] <Cork> or if you don't want the closest at all http://jsfiddle.net/d6KEh/6/
[23:44:23] <Guest79085> Cork YES ! i dont know how can i thank you
[23:44:42] <Guest79085> :)
[23:45:00] <Cork> heh np
[23:45:17] <howardgrigg> hey, using sortable how can i get the positions updated whenever there is a change to the order - kind of like this http://jsfiddle.net/HgAQu/1391/
[23:45:38] <howardgrigg> but with all positions updated not just the one that has been moved
