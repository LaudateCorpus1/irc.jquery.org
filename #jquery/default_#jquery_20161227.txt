[00:05:56] <Cypris> jquery.post().done() is there a way to use what would be "data" in $.post(...).done(function(data) {...}); but not as a parameter of function()?
[01:53:12] <Potato__> Hello
[01:53:32] <Potato__> Just a quick question
[01:54:57] <Potato__> I am going to use the JQuery but I want the JQuery UI as well. Do I need to add both to the website or do I just need one?
[04:19:48] <lemonsparrow> amazing tech talk on node.js eventloop.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoAo_cet3x8 explains the eventloop so effortlessly and clearly :)
[04:43:10] <Cypris> Lets I have a function which calls Promise.resolve for an ajax request and also includes a then(), how can i return the value from then() to the function which is currently being excuted so it can return that value to code that called it?
[05:09:27] <systemfault> Cypris: Do you have an example? Some code you could show to help us understand your issue
[05:09:52] * Cypris sighs
[05:10:40] <Cypris> A buddy of mine clearly introduced me to something that is not only wayyyyy above my head, but would require massively recoding my app. I think I need an asprin.
[05:12:46] <systemfault> :/
[05:13:36] <Cypris> Oy.. If i can only access a value that is set inside the promise that means i need to convert all of my sync. code to be async by way of putting everything inside of Promises. systemfault, can you... promise... to blow my brains out in about 10 minutes? lol
[05:14:01] <systemfault> :p
[05:14:25] <systemfault> If I can help, I will
[05:14:40] <Cypris> im not even sure where to begin
[05:15:11] <Cypris> but on a good note.. You mark the first person to respond to one of my questions in the last year or so. (on freenode in this channel)
[05:15:29] <Cypris> i feel like there should be confetti.
[05:15:33] <Cypris> and cake.
[05:16:20] <systemfault> ;)

[09:27:04] <jquery575> Hi, how do I loop it after 5 seconds ---> http://jsfiddle.net/XZXLk/112/

[10:30:10] <jquery446> Hello guys
[10:30:13] * hlve slaps jquery446 with a trout.
[10:30:17] <jquery446> Anyone can answer this question:
[10:30:18] <jquery446> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41312786/remove-link-on-scroll
[10:30:27] <jquery446> Would be much appreciated
[10:37:26] <taplar> that's really strange
[10:37:46] <hlve> you're really strange, :)
[10:37:56] <taplar> you seem to keep ignoring the fact that duplicate ids are invalid markup
[10:38:52] <taplar> hlve: true dat, :)
[10:40:40] <jquery446> The setup that I have I can change it to suite it better for the fucntion
[10:40:47] <jquery446> it desont need to be exact like this
[10:46:45] <taplar> if they scroll down you want to remove links?
[10:53:16] <jquery446> Yes thats right
[10:53:57] <jquery446> Lets say that there is 5 images and 5 links. Everytime you scroll to a div, I want a link (first link for instance) to be remove
[10:54:31] <taplar> you want all other links to show, except for the one already in view
[10:54:46] <taplar> so you can jump to "other" things
[10:55:57] <jquery446> yes
[10:56:47] <jquery446> Lets say I have 5 images and 5 links. When you scroll to image 1, link 1 would be removed. Scroll to image 2, link 2 would be removed etc
[10:58:17] <taplar> right, so conceptually you'd have a scroll handler on the body or a container of the elements.  and you'd find which one had a position in the view of 0 or less and of those take the one with the smallest distance from 0 and that would be the element you'd find the related link to to hide
[10:59:35] <jquery446> yeah, Thats the idea. I have tried in 3 days now and nothing I was looking for :( Would be you be able to answer it on stackoverflow please?
[11:00:17] <taplar> currently at work so i can't spend much time on there.  you should look into figuring out how to calculate that scroll number first
[11:03:58] <jquery446> okei, I have done that already, but removing links are issue. And since I cant reference a ID to remove, it raises more issues :(
[11:04:14] <jquery446> I hope you could take a time to look at when you are free. Thanks :)
[11:04:29] <taplar> id's aren't the only way to select things
[11:04:49] <taplar> you can select by a class and filter by other things such as data elements or other attributes

[11:08:15] <jeffrin> hello all
[11:08:39] <xdevnull> Hello people
[11:09:15] <xdevnull> In event delegations. $("table").on("click", "td", function() {}); does the event goes up from table to body to the window? or it stop bubbling in the "Table" ?
[11:09:15] <jeffrin> how to make the following code work... http://pastebin.com/WeAEXygW
[11:09:41] <taplar> xdevnull: event bubbling is not changed with delegation
[11:10:15] <jquery799> If I click reset button I want to reset the bingo ---> http://jsfiddle.net/FloydPink/KHLtw/
[11:12:02] <fuchstronaut> jquery799: i dont see a reset button
[11:12:56] <xdevnull> taplar i mean does the upper parents of "table" get notified?
[11:13:11] <jquery799> http://jsfiddle.net/KHLtw/787/
[11:13:15] <jquery799> missed to save =)
[11:13:30] <jquery799> fuchstronaut  http://jsfiddle.net/KHLtw/787/
[11:13:45] <xdevnull> jquery799 you script caused my browser to crash xD
[11:13:55] <xdevnull> your*
[11:14:13] <taplar> xdevnull: if the event in question would not stop bubbling in whatever handler you have if were not delegated, it will act the same with a delegate event handler
[11:14:37] <jquery799> Yes, thats another problem, when it reached MAX which is 4 right now, the script crash
[11:16:25] <jquery799> http://jsfiddle.net/KHLtw/789/
[11:18:33] <fuchstronaut> jquery799: http://jsfiddle.net/KHLtw/790/
[11:20:05] <jquery654> right now if you reach 4 number, the next will crash ---> http://jsfiddle.net/KHLtw/789/
[11:20:29] <jquery654> how to stop the random calculate if the max number is reached ?
[11:23:33] <jquery708> did some fixed it?
[11:48:36] <traptrip> I'm having a little trouble attaching a live mouseenter event handler for a dynamically generated element. my code looks somewhat like http://pastebin.com/ENzLN2T8 - am I asking too much of jQuery here or am I missing something?
[11:49:41] <taplar> where is your event handler?
[11:49:42] <traptrip> I'm attaching a handle for $('.splash a.video-link'), which is defined in $visibleSlide.attr('data-caption')
[11:49:47] <traptrip> handler *
[11:50:36] <traptrip> the handler looks like http://pastebin.com/iUCHbhiy
[11:51:16] <taplar> are you calling those bindings before the new elements are created?
[11:51:31] <traptrip> yes, the bindings are defined in $(document).ready()
[11:51:56] <traptrip> but I thought the whole idea of live bindings are that they are automatically tracked and attached by jQuery?
[11:51:59] <taplar> then I would suggest you change those to be delegate bindings instead, so new elements will also be affected by them
[11:52:04] <taplar> those are not live
[11:52:10] <traptrip> ah, I see
[11:52:44] <traptrip> I'm reading: As of jQuery 3.0, .delegate() has been deprecated. It was superseded by the .on() method since jQuery 1.7, so its use was already discouraged.
[11:52:58] <taplar> right, you should use on
[11:52:59] <traptrip> I'm assuming you are referring to something else?
[11:53:06] <taplar> no, on() has a delegate version
[11:53:16] <traptrip> oh I think I remember ..
[11:53:23] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[11:54:10] <traptrip> I've actually done this before but totally forgot
[11:54:12] <traptrip> thank you
[11:55:42] <traptrip> works now
[11:56:03] <taplar> awesome
[13:54:17] <Forbidd3n> I am using autocomplete="off" but form fields are still remembering and showing saved usernames and passwords. Is there a way to disabled this via scripting?
[13:55:02] <duch_kazatel> just usernames and passwords?
[13:55:39] <duch_kazatel> because https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Securing_your_site/Turning_off_form_autocompletion#The_autocomplete_attribute_and_login_fields talks about that.
[13:57:00] <duch_kazatel> Forbidd3n ^
[13:58:48] <Forbidd3n> duch_kazatel: autocomplete="new-password" isn't working either
[13:59:15] <duch_kazatel> "If a site sets autocomplete="off" for username and password input fields, then the browser will still offer to remember this login, and if the user agrees, the browser will autofill those fields the next time the user visits the page."
[13:59:45] <duch_kazatel> also, w/r/t new-password: "[...] support for this has not been implemented in all browsers yet."
[13:59:59] <duch_kazatel> why don't you want the browser to save passwords?
[14:01:58] <Forbidd3n> duch_kazatel: I have a user management concept so when they go to create a new user it is filling the data in with my username and password so I have to remove that to create a new user everytime
[14:04:18] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[14:05:49] <Forbidd3n> The only thing I can think of is to create new-user and new-pass field names and modify my server side code to accept that
[14:05:54] <duch_kazatel> eh.
[14:05:56] <Forbidd3n> What a hassel...!
[14:06:15] <duch_kazatel> i'd just highlight the text in the field so if they start typing it gets replaced.
[14:06:29] <Forbidd3n> yeah, but that will get confusing to the user
[14:06:33] <duch_kazatel> nah.
[14:06:41] <duch_kazatel> most users will know what's going on
[14:06:45] <Forbidd3n> depending on the "dumb-user"
[14:06:57] <duch_kazatel> lol
[14:07:00] <duch_kazatel> it'll be fine.
[14:07:22] <taplar> the dumb user puts the lotion on its skin
[14:12:23] <Forbidd3n> duch_kazatel: hmm, no matter what I change the field to in the new user form it is still saving it
[14:12:24] <Forbidd3n> WTF!
[14:12:53] <duch_kazatel> you're fighting against a pretty standard browser feature.
[14:13:48] <Forbidd3n> ok so what you are recommending is that when they select that field to automatically select all text so when they start typing it removes the existing text
[14:13:58] <duch_kazatel> that's one way to do it.
[14:14:46] <Forbidd3n> another way
[14:14:48] <Forbidd3n> ?
[14:15:06] <duch_kazatel> use js to stop the autofille.
[14:15:13] <duch_kazatel> lots of google search results out there.
[14:15:26] <Forbidd3n> duch_kazatel: that is the route I tried to take, but wasn't successful
[14:15:35] <duch_kazatel> then show us.
[14:15:39] <Forbidd3n> I tried jquery to set the value = ''
[14:15:50] <duch_kazatel> great - show us the code you used.
[14:15:54] <Forbidd3n> on document ready I did $('#username').val('');
[14:15:59] <duch_kazatel> lol
[14:16:03] <Forbidd3n> lol?
[14:16:04] <duch_kazatel> mind making a fiddle?
[14:16:15] <duch_kazatel> sorry, keep trying to get you to actually show a complete example.
[14:17:16] <Forbidd3n> duch_kazatel: no need for a fiddle. there is an input field id, username and I have - $(document).ready(function(){ $('#username').val(''); });
[14:17:22] <duch_kazatel> ...
[14:17:31] <duch_kazatel> okay good luck then.
[14:17:53] <Forbidd3n> duch_kazatel: how is a fiddle going to reproduce my issue when the password on the field being saved is local to me
[14:18:10] <duch_kazatel> gives us something to play with.
[14:18:16] <duch_kazatel> and the ability to try different things.
[14:18:22] <duch_kazatel> helps me confirm your markup and other things.
[14:18:30] <duch_kazatel> and then we can find a solution!  it's pretty rad.
[14:18:48] <taplar> code sharing.  such a communist
[14:18:49] <Forbidd3n> duch_kazatel: but there is no way to reproduce the scenario unless you have an account on fiddle and logged into is and storing the creds in the browser
[14:19:07] <Forbidd3n> duch_kazatel: I showed the markup.
[14:19:12] <duch_kazatel> (shrug) still gives me something to play with.
[14:19:15] <Forbidd3n> Just a simple html input element
[14:19:25] <duch_kazatel> awesome!  so you're like 80% of the way there!
[14:19:27] <duch_kazatel> good news :)
[14:19:54] <duch_kazatel> but it sounds like i'm wasting your time. sorry :< good luck though!  i know you'll figure it out.
[14:20:21] <Forbidd3n> duch_kazatel: it removes the values on submit but the initial load it doesn't. My markup is correct. Do you have anything online that you know of that shows how to remove the content in the field on load when autocomplete is set
[14:20:54] <duch_kazatel> A quick google search returned a few SO questions on the subject and some related stuff.
[14:21:09] <Forbidd3n> duch_kazatel: and I have tried a few of them with no success
[14:21:13] <duch_kazatel> oh ok.
[14:21:15] <duch_kazatel> dunnmo then. sorry!
[14:38:08] <duch_kazatel> today is dragging.
[14:38:53] <taplar> yup
[17:33:14] <taplar> bah, missing classes
[17:38:24] <duch_kazatel> gross
[17:39:07] <taplar> go to upgrade a jar and can't find stuff.  annoying
[17:39:49] <duch_kazatel> ew.
[18:01:56] <Kinesthetic> Anyone good with WordPress wp_get_image_editor? Problem with crop method on wp_get_image_editor. Using jQuery guillotine plugin to get data from the front-end. Here is the code : https://codepaste.net/qs5qu6 | https://codepaste.net/earrtq
[18:03:19] <duch_kazatel> Kinesthetic so is the issue with the backend or the frontent?
[18:07:56] <Kinesthetic> Both, something between getting the 'scale' factor to translate image size then crop. The x,y reference co-ordinates should change with respect to zoomed-in or zoomed-out image, but they ignore the zoomed dimensions of the image
[18:08:08] <Kinesthetic> duch_kazatel, ^
[18:08:42] <duch_kazatel> ah, so your problem is specifically with getting the cropped coords to respect the zoom level?
[18:12:21] <Kinesthetic> duch_kazatel, yes. that should be the primary issue I could think of. Cropped image fails to 'scale' first
[18:14:10] <duch_kazatel> sorry, i'm lost again.  good luck :()
[18:18:49] <Kinesthetic> duch_kazatel, thanks still (:
[18:19:42] <duch_kazatel> fwiw is sounds like your problem is with your php side, not your jquery side.
[18:25:00] <Kinesthetic> duch_kazatel, could you suggest any other lean or popular alternatives to guillotine plugin?
[18:25:10] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[18:25:31] <duch_kazatel> let me clarify: i think the issue exists as apart of your backend.
[18:25:41] <duch_kazatel> but maybe i'm wrong (shrug) gotta jsfiddle or something?
[18:25:59] <Kinesthetic> duch_kazatel, everything works fine if I skip zooming on image
[18:26:19] <Kinesthetic> Let me setup a fiddle for you
[18:26:29] <duch_kazatel> - so have you logged out the data you get from when you're zoomed?
[18:26:39] <duch_kazatel> and are you zooming the browser?
[18:27:36] <Kinesthetic> duch_kazatel, yes log reports all the proper values
[18:27:57] <duch_kazatel> okay - so then it sounds like the php side of things isn't doing what you're expecting.
[18:28:15] <duch_kazatel> so a jsfiddle wouldn't really help.
[18:28:17] <Kinesthetic> Zooming browser, no..what? :D
[18:28:48] <duch_kazatel> heh, you can zoom your browser in and out.  just clarifying.
[18:29:28] <Kinesthetic> duch_kazatel, yes but how is that useful to crop user uploaded images. I am not using any iframes or something :)
[18:29:38] <duch_kazatel> i'm not saying it is.
[18:29:48] <duch_kazatel> i was trying to clarify and understand the problem.
[18:30:01] <duch_kazatel> but what you're telling me makes it sound like your php isn't doing what you expect.
[18:30:08] <Kinesthetic> Haha I get you. Here is nice demo of the jquery plugin with reference values
[18:30:10] <Kinesthetic> http://guillotine.js.org/
[18:30:17] <duch_kazatel> heh.
[18:30:54] <duch_kazatel> so yeah either way it sounds like your server-side isn't working properly.
[18:31:03] <duch_kazatel> maybe make sure that takes the values you're getting properly.
[18:31:36] <Kinesthetic> duch_kazatel, it's been 2 days and this thing is driving me crazy. I am cluless now XD
[18:31:57] <duch_kazatel> have you tried ##php?
[18:32:06] <Kinesthetic> duch_kazatel, I double checked for the values on backend side
[18:32:20] <duch_kazatel> and you're getting the correct values sent to the server, right?
[18:32:21] <Kinesthetic> duch_kazatel, yes I did with no one interested, lol
[18:32:39] <Kinesthetic> Yes, I get the correct values to the server side
[18:32:44] <duch_kazatel> right so the issue is that this is a great place to get support for jquery.  your problem is with a php.
[18:32:47] <duch_kazatel> *with php
[18:33:41] <Kinesthetic> Awh, I was hoping I could do something with jquery to skip the server side issue. But ok :'(
[18:33:58] <duch_kazatel> if the server isn't cropping things correctly, you're kind of SOL.
[18:34:55] <Kinesthetic> duch_kazatel, like guillotine draws the visible area of the image to html5 canvas, may be I could write that data to an image file?
[18:34:59] <taplar> i'd have to ask what another group is doing.  i know they are doing cropping in the browser.
[18:36:08] <Kinesthetic> taplar, what do you mean? xP
[18:36:30] <taplar> i'm texting one of the guys now to see if he remembers
[18:36:48] <Kinesthetic> taplar, oh, great! thanks
[18:38:48] <taplar> https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropper
[18:39:47] <taplar> i love scm, :D
[18:39:52] <duch_kazatel> hah
[18:41:24] <Kinesthetic> taplar, I tried cropper before moving to guillotine, cropper has similar issues :(
[18:41:52] <duch_kazatel> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[18:42:33] <Kinesthetic> duch_kazatel, How do you do that, what irc client are you on? XD
[18:42:52] <duch_kazatel> https://textfac.es/ - click then paste
[18:43:06] <Kinesthetic> taplar, duch_kazatel I am gonna give cropper another go. It was more promising than guillotine ^^
[18:43:26] <Kinesthetic> duch_kazatel, that's super cool XD
[18:44:32] <duch_kazatel> sure.

[19:18:00] <Aven> hi
[19:18:08] <duch_kazatel> good afternoon!
[19:21:19] <Aven> I understand we make namespaces like this (function() { })()
[19:21:24] <duch_kazatel> sort of.
[19:21:33] <Aven> what's the point of passing (jQuery) in the end?
[19:21:39] <duch_kazatel> that's more how you create a one-time use scope.
[19:21:56] <Aven> hmm
[19:21:58] <Aven> meaning?
[19:22:06] <duch_kazatel> a namespace isn't a scope.
[19:22:14] <Aven> ah
[19:22:17] <duch_kazatel> :)
[19:22:30] <Aven> so how would you access such a scope? if you pass jQuery
[19:22:40] <duch_kazatel> errr, wrong question :)
[19:22:46] <Aven> it would be a namespace if it was var myNamespace = (function... ?
[19:22:48] <duch_kazatel> you want to know why you'd pass jquery to an IIFE.
[19:23:03] <duch_kazatel> nope.  where'd you read that iifes are namespaces?
[19:23:50] <duch_kazatel> either way, i assume you mean something like https://bpaste.net/show/5e4b92460c9c ?
[19:24:49] <Aven> yeah but the code I'm looking at doesn't have document.ready
[19:24:58] <Aven> but it does use jQuery
[19:25:01] <duch_kazatel> sure, but it has the first and last lines, right?
[19:25:19] <duch_kazatel> (function ($) { /* your code here */ })(jQuery);
[19:25:56] <Aven> yes for sure
[19:26:17] <duch_kazatel> yeah so that's basically "aliasing" jQuery for you.
[19:26:34] <duch_kazatel> it makes sure you can use $ as a "shorthand"
[19:27:07] <Aven> ah
[19:27:38] <Aven> so it's making your own jquery?
[19:27:44] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[19:27:49] <duch_kazatel> just assigning the name,
[19:28:04] <Aven> cause when I use the jquery library by linking it... I don't need to do that
[19:28:09] <Aven> I could use $ directly
[19:28:13] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[19:28:30] <duch_kazatel> what do you mean "by linking it"?
[19:28:34] <Aven> meaning... I do something like <script src="jquery.js">
[19:28:37] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[19:28:40] <duch_kazatel> you still have to do that.
[19:28:48] <duch_kazatel> you still have to include jquery.
[19:28:57] <Aven> but then I could do $(document) directly without need to create a iife
[19:29:05] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[19:29:19] <duch_kazatel> if you want to use jquery, you have to include it.
[19:30:16] <Aven> but I mean, what's the point of doing (function($){})(jQuery)
[19:30:26] <Aven> can't you use $ directly in there without it?
[19:30:41] <Aven> cause I can use $(document).ready.. directly
[19:30:41] <duch_kazatel> if nothing else has overwritten it.
[19:30:55] <duch_kazatel> something else could be using $.
[19:30:55] <Aven> ah
[19:31:14] <Aven> well that explains how to fix issues I've had in the past, lol
[19:31:26] <duch_kazatel> iifes are also useful because you don't have to wait for document ready to declare functions and stuff.
[19:31:40] <Aven> ah nice
[19:32:26] <duch_kazatel> so you declare a bunch of stuff and then use it in the nested doc ready as necessary.
