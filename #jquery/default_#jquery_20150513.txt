[00:07:55] <MarkProffitt> I want to make sortable/draggable list that allows vertical insertion but can add items at the same level horizontally.  How should I go about it?
[00:08:34] <MarkProffitt> Sortable works perfectly for the vertical.  But I need to be able to have items that are equal.
[00:44:14] <forQuery> $(document.getElementById('#id') ) vs  $("#id")
[00:44:19] <forQuery> i just did a jsperf on these
[00:44:28] <forQuery> over 2x faster for the first one, with same result
[00:46:12] <Cork> forQuery: compare $(document.querySelector('#id')) if you want to make a fare comparison
[00:47:19] <Duvdevan> jQuery is made by Mossad and CIA
[00:47:24] <Duvdevan> it's a join operation of the two
[00:48:01] <Duvdevan> in some less degree Russian FBS and Pakisanian ISI were involved, as well as MI5/6 and BND, in a more less amount of involvement
[00:48:02] <Duvdevan> ;)
[00:49:42] <Cork> O_o
[00:49:48] <Cork> uhhh
[00:50:12] <Cork> Duvdevan: cut back on the drugs there
[00:50:23] <Cork> you're tripping a bit hard
[00:50:34] <Duvdevan> it's not drugs man
[00:50:39] <Duvdevan> it's a stronger bosnian coffe
[00:50:42] <Duvdevan> and a green tea
[00:50:53] <Duvdevan> maybe that mix is producing a drug effect?
[00:50:54] <Uhkis> so it's the lack of drugs that keep you stable?
[00:51:04] <Duvdevan> I don't do drugs dawgs
[00:55:45] <Duvdevan> it's just coffe and green tea
[00:58:58] <Duvdevan> btw brothers and sisters
[00:59:03] <Duvdevan> is John Resig Jewish?

[01:31:32] <Xatenev> Anybody familiar with the google maps api?
[01:34:30] <FilipNortic> Xatenev: it's often best just to ask the question you want answer to and see if anyone answer it or maybe directs you elsewhere
[01:34:58] <Xatenev> Well I got a google map here, and onclick the red dot I wnat to show the routing panel :]
[01:35:10] <Xatenev> digging through the docs https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference right now but didnt find anything yer
[01:35:14] <Xatenev> yet
[01:41:28] <Xatenev> Nobody an idea? :|
[01:42:44] <FilipNortic> seems so. there is a google channel on freenode and likely a google-maps channel if it's important try any of them
[01:43:15] <Xatenev> im in there already :p
[01:44:43] <FilipNortic> well if they don't answer you there it's not likely anyone here will their api docs are huge...
[01:46:21] <Xatenev> yep
[01:51:52] <dimi1947> suppose I have an id=from_wednesday....is there anyway I can use the getElementById method but target only the text that is after the underline(the weekname)
[01:53:43] <Kartagis> heh, I copy/paste the said-to-be working example on jsfiddle, change the ID, hit JSHint and I get several errors
[02:01:48] <flexpaint> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ed268f284683f2047bd5 did i do this textfill function right? new to js
[02:01:53] <flexpaint> field-parent is a class
[02:10:58] <kokut> Hello, jQuery('.main-container').css('padding', '0', 'important'); is not adding the !important to the property, is there any other way of doing it that actually works?
[02:11:00] <flexpaint> https://jsfiddle.net/aq3hcr3c/ anyone use this? kind of confusing
[02:13:37] <kokut> nvm found a fix with jQuery('.main-container').attr('style', 'padding-bottom:0px !important');
[02:28:59] <thedonut>  Hello, I'm using jQuery inview (https://github.com/protonet/jquery.inview) and want to use it to fade in LI's each, as they are visible, I've got it working on all of them, but not individually http://pastebin.com/HPhvYfLz
[02:32:59] <doug16k> thedonut, all but not individually?
[02:33:13] <doug16k> doesn't make sense
[02:36:49] <thedonut> doug16k: I want them to come in one by one, if that makes sense, as they are visible, at the moment, the whole block of LI's comes in at the same time
[02:56:02] <phpcoder> hello everybody
[02:56:12] <phpcoder> guys i have a problem...i have this code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4fdbc3c021d4fd47fcc4
[02:56:28] <phpcoder> i set chosen() to all the elements of the page with specific classes
[02:56:37] <phpcoder> the problem is that i also need to set chosen()
[02:56:40] <phpcoder> to element loaded via ajax
[02:56:43] <phpcoder> how can i do that?
[02:58:16] <nikhil_> phpcoder: i guess you could use a wrapper element and bind to it via .on('event', function() {...})
[02:59:28] <nikhil_> im not sure of the exact syntax of .on() but the idea is you bind (sorry there must be a better word for that, i'm a python guy) to an element you know will exist for the whole life of the page and look for events on that
[02:59:33] <nikhil_> phpcoder: ^^
[02:59:55] <phpcoder> nikhil_, i can trigger an event
[03:00:04] <phpcoder> and i can add this code to this event
[03:00:14] <phpcoder> so everytime i call this event
[03:00:24] <phpcoder> i will have all the elements updated
[03:00:38] <nikhil_> yup, or code to just update part of the config that you need to based on the ajax event that just fired and succeeded
[03:00:47] <thedonut> Nobody any ideas on mine? :(
[03:01:11] <phpcoder> nikhil_, thanks
[03:04:30] <nikhil_> phpcoder: an example of how i use on(), it might not be best practise but i bind to all the rows in the table which have .itemDelete and that works even though i reload the html for the table via ajax
[03:04:33] <nikhil_> https://dpaste.de/f18F
[03:06:30] <phpcoder> nikhil_, where you bind() ?
[03:06:37] <phpcoder> i mean where you update it?
[03:07:18] <nikhil_> phpcoder: line 19 html is injected from json response
[03:07:52] <nikhil_> but the click is still bound at the top on line (1) where on() is used
[03:08:02] <Cork> nikhil_: delegating the event handler IS best practice
[03:08:13] <Cork> so ya, you're good there
[03:08:26] <nikhil_> Cork: i was talking about my injecting template variables and inlining javascript ;)
[03:08:39] <phpcoder> Cork, creating custom event?
[03:09:04] <Cork> creating custom events isn't uncommon
[03:09:12] <nikhil_> probably not necessary
[03:09:15] <Cork> jquery-ui does it all over the place
[03:09:33] <Cork> you should do it with discretion though
[03:09:41] <phpcoder> wait
[03:09:43] <phpcoder> i mean https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b57e68c7c261f6c0f881
[03:09:44] <Cork> it should always be events from user actions
[03:09:48] <phpcoder> i have create page:update event
[03:09:54] <phpcoder> sowhen i need to update page
[03:10:01] <phpcoder> id do .trigger('page:update')
[03:10:04] <phpcoder> wrong way?
[03:10:08] <Cork> eh...
[03:10:29] <Cork> well it isn't horrible, but using a callback would prob be better
[03:11:31] <phpcoder> Cork, the problem here is that i have differet part of my code that do ajax call
[03:11:38] <phpcoder> so i have to add a callback on each of them
[03:11:45] <Cork> not really
[03:11:46] <phpcoder> so for this case i have created ONE event
[03:11:52] <phpcoder> that i call always
[03:12:07] <Cork> you just need a global event object
[03:12:13] <Cork> or rather callback object
[03:12:22] <Cork> and to it register the callbacks you want ($.callback)
[03:12:37] <Cork> and then just do gcallbacks.update.fire(data)
[03:12:47] <phpcoder> what do you mean with "global event object" ?
[03:12:50] <phpcoder> uh interesting..
[03:13:21] <Cork> window.gcallbacks = { update: $.Callbacks() }; gcallbacks.update.add(me);
[03:13:27] <Cork> gcallbacks.update.fire(data)
[03:13:40] <Cork> that i would see as a cleaner solution
[03:13:45] <phpcoder> but in this case i always have to do       gcallbacks.update.fire(data) <--- on each ajax call                     like i did with .trigger('page:update')
[03:13:48] <phpcoder> ah ok
[03:14:00] <Cork> yes you would
[03:14:17] <Cork> its just that you don't fire events on the dom for things that doesn't really matter to the dom
[03:14:28] <phpcoder> ah ok
[03:14:29] <phpcoder> perfect
[03:14:53] <Cork> if it instead was an event for a specific element has been updated
[03:14:57] <Cork> i could agree with it
[03:15:05] <Cork> (but then it shouldn't bubble)
[03:16:18] <phpcoder> ok
[03:16:21] <phpcoder> thank you !!
[03:27:16] <user> Anyone know of a jquery plugin that makes a resposive lightbox that supports videos using the video tag?
[03:33:07] <Koushik> Hello everybody.
[03:35:13] <thedonut> is it possible to use multiple selectors when identifying them for an each? For example: $('.recipe_steps li', '.video', '.somethingelse').each
[03:37:28] <Cork> thedonut: you mean you want to have separate groups looped by each?
[03:37:37] <thedonut> yeah
[03:37:40] <Cork> or just select all of them and loop over them?
[03:38:03] <thedonut> I just want to be able to do the same thing for 3 or 4 groups, without writing them on 3 or 4 times
[03:38:25] <Cork> thebigkiwi: so just combind the selector and loop all of then
[03:38:32] <Koushik> In my project I am having a form containing huge amount of information. This form doesn't contain any file type field. In the current implementation, we have used ajaxSubmit call of jquery form plugin. Thait is working fine but the current requirement tells us to implement readyState in ajaxSubmit call and keep provision so that we cand get amount of form data getting transferred to server. After I googled, I found some code to add 
[03:38:34] <Cork> $('.recipe_steps li, .video, .somethingelse').each
[03:39:13] <Cork> Koushik: separate the question from the backstory
[03:39:25] <thedonut> Cork: Thanks
[03:39:30] <Cork> scanning through a gigantic blob of test to see what the question is takes a lot of time
[03:39:47] <Koushik> ajaxSubmit call and I have used uploadProgress callback to get the amount of information transferred to the server. But none are found to be working.
[03:40:03] <Cork> ah
[03:40:12] <Cork> progress requires support server side
[03:40:31] <Koushik> What kind of..
[03:41:48] <Cork> the server needs to send the processing responses
[03:42:47] <Koushik> Do we require Comet or any other technology like that to be implemented in order to get uploadProgress going?
[03:42:57] <Cork> no
[03:43:15] <Cork> but you might have to use a separate request parser
[03:43:34] <Cork> as the build in php one requires to parse the complete request before it can process anything
[03:45:12] <Koushik> The project is a j2ee project and we are having server side action classes implemented to process the request.
[03:46:24] <Koushik> Would you please suggest me any source where I can find detail discussion in this topic.
[03:49:42] <Cork> no i can't
[03:49:55] <Cork> i've only needed it once
[03:50:55] <Koushik> What's about adding readyState option in ajaxSubmit?
[04:03:48] <flexpaint> how can i use textfill to use divs instead of spans? https://jsfiddle.net/xypL1Lkg/
[04:06:27] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/knv2huby/1/ why am I getting missing semicolon on line #3?
[04:10:34] <decx> your input doesnt have a name attribute and you  end a propertylist with ;
[04:16:09] <Macaveli> Is it possible to  add URL params like #success on page load?
[04:17:01] <Cork> sure
[04:17:11] <Cork> window.location.hash = 'success'
[04:18:52] <Koushik> How to add readyState option in ajaxSubmit call?
[04:24:13] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/knv2huby/1/ why am I getting missing semicolon on line #3?
[04:24:29] <Kartagis> oh, sorry decx. you replied
[04:24:39] <Cork> Kartagis: you can't define an object like that
[04:24:53] <Cork> (in es5 that is)
[04:25:28] <Cork> Kartagis: simplest solution is to use serialize() instead
[04:34:02] <xqo> hi, can you make an object iterable without using ES6?
[04:34:26] <Cork> xqo: for in isn't es6
[04:34:33] <Cork> or just use $.each
[04:36:54] <xqo> Cork i want to do this, line 18 http://jsfiddle.net/k1wkxy5p/
[04:37:29] <Cork> xqo: no getters doesn't exist in es5
[04:37:46] <xqo> Cork line 3 is ES6?
[04:37:56] <Cork> line 4
[04:38:08] <Cork> and yes line 3
[04:38:32] <Cork> there's been several interactions of it since es5
[04:38:39] <xqo> oh, thank you very much. then I can just use ES6 to make my object iterable i suppose!
[04:39:34] <Cork> xqo: you could just do what jquery does though
[04:39:50] <xqo> waht does it do?
[04:41:13] <Cork> xqo: http://jsfiddle.net/8109oouw/
[04:41:40] <xqo> Cork people keep linking me this though, its not a problem? http://perfectionkills.com/how-ecmascript-5-still-does-not-allow-to-subclass-an-array/
[05:03:20] <Xatenev> Cork: do u know the google maps api a bit maybe?
[05:03:41] <Cork> i haven't used it in years
[05:03:49] <Xatenev> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3268099/what-is-openinfowindowhtml-and-gpolygon-in-google-maps-v3 I found this example it does exactly what I want , now I wanna add the event listener on the marker
[05:03:57] <Xatenev> it says .addListener(yourOverlay
[05:04:14] <Xatenev> yourOverlay should be the marker in my caes :\
[05:04:18] <Xatenev> case :\, how do I get it?
[05:05:01] <Cork> Xatenev: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/icon-simple
[05:06:02] <Xatenev> Cork: how does this help me xd
[05:06:17] <Xatenev> Its an extension here
[05:06:17] <Cork> Xatenev: that is how you add event handlers for markers
[05:06:19] <Xatenev> I dont have something like var marker
[05:06:20] <Cork> (last line)
[05:06:50] <Xatenev> But he does something else
[05:06:57] <Xatenev> I want the event handler for the marker, he doesnt do that
[05:06:58] <Xatenev> o>o
[05:07:13] <Xatenev> he initializes the map on window load
[05:07:20] <Xatenev> I want to show the routing panel onclick the marker
[05:07:27] <Cork> Xatenev: check around on the developer page
[05:07:36] <Xatenev> yea im searching through
[05:07:38] <Xatenev> but im unable to find anything xd
[05:07:41] <Cork> it usually have the info you need (though you need to dig a bit)
[05:07:47] <Xatenev> its just so huge xd
[05:08:03] <Cork> heres some more info https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/rectangle-event
[05:08:16] <Xatenev> the problem is
[05:08:21] <Xatenev> all examples create the marker by JS
[05:08:33] <Xatenev> I got an extension here which does it somewhere, so I have to retrieve the marker again :X
[05:08:37] <Cork> anyway i can't help you much, cause i would have to read there documentation to say anything
[05:08:57] <Cork> but like always i would be careful with so comments
[05:09:09] <Xatenev> yup
[05:09:09] <Xatenev> ^^
[05:09:19] <Xatenev> it looks like I want atleast
[05:09:19] <Xatenev> xd
[05:09:22] <Xatenev> like what I want atleast*
[05:09:50] <azanc> Cork: Hi Cork, you helped me 70% yesterday - here i did a summary of my needs http://pastebin.com/PP2RbfnE so you can link to the yesterday facts.  With your help I succeed creating this button with this effect here http://jsfiddle.net/vvjj8/6638/ but the same code do not work here http://www.vedelago.gov.it/TestNewsletter2.html . Yesterday i tried all my best to replicate the click() effect on Chrome DevConsole but i do not how to change the JS loop it seem
[05:09:51] <azanc> to get into.. =/
[05:10:01] <Cork> ugg
[05:10:13] <Cork> azanc: i'm not going to plow through that blob
[05:12:10] <azanc> Cork: that’s because of my bad explanation or too much confusion? Even if i asked you if you eg: accept BTC or some kind of revenue i can pay to you ? ty for the answer BTW
[05:12:38] <Cork> azanc: i already have a full time job (actually more then a full time ;P)
[05:12:53] <Cork> that is why the question needs to be quick to grasp
[05:13:19] <Cork> leave explanations for follow up questions if needed
[05:13:41] <Cork> (yes it takes longer, but it means i can answer you at all)
[05:14:26] <jonez> greetings. I have a question. I am using a jquery plugin called ion.rangeslider. I have it set up the way I want except that the value is in a "property" vs. an "attribute" and I don't know how to access it. please help :)
[05:14:59] <Cork> ?paste @ jonez
[05:15:20] <Cork> sigh what have they changed the command to now...
[05:15:26] <Cork> `paste @ jonez
[05:15:36] <azanc> Cork: ok ty, - with your last 3 msg you mean to do just one question at a time , did i get right? Or you would suggest me freelancer kind of site for a small “fix” like these (3days i get lost in docs & eg: stackoverflow)
[05:15:37] <Cork> jonez: put the code in jsfiddle.net
[05:15:50] <milka1> hello guys, have a problem, im quite new in jquery and doing internship, anyone might help?
[05:15:55] <jonez> I am using ionslider
[05:15:59] <milka1> doing menu for mobile website
[05:16:01] <Cork> azanc: this channel is for getting help so YOU can fix something
[05:16:08] <Cork> if you want someone to do it for you then ya, wrong place
[05:16:24] <decx> looks like you never include jquery ui
[05:16:31] <decx> and several other libs
[05:17:14] <decx> @azanc
[05:17:40] <decx> start using the console and you see tthat you have a bunch of type errors too
[05:17:41] <FilipNortic> the ones fiddle include for you maybe
[05:18:12] <decx> what was that slideshow with the "how to learn to debug"?
[05:19:13] <milka1> http://codepad.org/V9Pyzpo1 <-- so i have this, and what i want is to have .nav_menu slide down when i push the button and when i push it again to go back in "(top: -205px;)", but when i closing it slides up and down again. My tutor is off today, can anyone help me or give some reference?
[05:19:14] <shoky> `ftj
[05:19:15] <b-ot> shoky: Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[05:19:22] <decx> right
[05:19:25] <decx> that's it
[05:19:40] <azanc> decx: So I don’t know the best way to Debug (as yesterday in decConsole i add a event listener on mouse click but did not get any idea about the js it invokes). so decx, you were saing that in this page www.vedelago.gov.it/TestNewsletter2 seems to miss some jquery href?
[05:19:48] <decx> read that site
[05:19:55] <decx> become 1337
[05:20:08] <FilipNortic> yes when I learned to use console.log instead of alert I found myself asking less stupid questions in here
[05:21:05] <milka1> im not about debugging
[05:21:10] <milka1> im about giving me some reference
[05:21:19] <milka1> i am still very new to jquery anyway :)
[05:21:30] <Kartagis> Cork: I was trying to work from http://board.phpbuilder.com/showthread.php?10364921-RESOLVED-Calling-a-php-function-on-onBlur-event-of-a-textbox&p=10912476&viewfull=1#post10912476 (jquery part)
[05:23:05] <jonez> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/gxgjavb3/
[05:24:39] <Cork> jonez: ok, and the question is?
[05:25:34] <jonez> how do I access the "property" called value? I tried $("#slide").value
[05:25:54] <jonez> I also tried making a var, and then tried to access foo.value (object property) to no avail
[05:25:55] <Cork> that is a very plugin specific question
[05:26:05] <Cork> jonez: it isn't a plugin property
[05:26:11] <Cork> it is a plugin option value
[05:26:28] <Cork> and they might not even expose it
[05:26:43] <jonez> there must be a way else the slider would be useless :)
[05:26:48] <jonez> ty for your help, I'll dig a little more.
[05:27:00] <Cork> it might expect you to keep your own copy
[05:27:44] <Cork> jonez: have you had a look at http://ionden.com/a/plugins/ion.rangeSlider/demo_interactions.html ?
[05:32:13] <donm2> hi has anyone worked with google maps api ?
[05:35:12] <azanc> I have explicitly added these 2 script <script type='text/javascript' src='//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js'></script>
[05:35:13] <azanc> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.8.18/jquery-ui.min.js"></script> directly on the <head> of my test page (see above) .
[05:36:07] <azanc> decx: if it was for me, i look through http://fixingthesejquery.com/ and now i am open with devConsole (with Breakpoints on mouse click)
[05:36:51] <azanc> and it loop through this eventHandle   => if ( !eventHandle ) {
[05:36:52] <azanc> 			elemData.handle = eventHandle = function( e ) {
[05:36:53] <azanc> 				// Discard the second event of a jQuery.event.trigger() and
[05:36:55] <azanc> 				// when an event is called after a page has unloaded
[05:36:56] <azanc> 				return typeof jQuery !== "undefined" && (!e || jQuery.event.triggered !== e.type) ?
[05:36:58] <azanc> 					jQuery.event.dispatch.apply( eventHandle.elem, arguments ) :
[05:36:59] <azanc> 					undefined;
[05:36:59] <azanc> 			};
[05:37:03] <Cork> ugg
[05:37:08] <Cork> don't paste code in the channel
[05:37:34] <azanc> Cork: ok sorry (thought was 1 line)
[05:37:42] <milka1> whats the best website for code paste?
[05:37:47] <Cork> no it was 7 lines
[05:38:20] <Kartagis> milka1: try jsfiddle.net
[05:38:27] <Kartagis> one of the best
[05:39:17] <decx> it's simple the best, du du du du better than all the rest du du du
[05:39:58] <milka1> thanks!
[05:40:10] <milka1> can i ask a really novice question? :\
[05:41:11] <milka1> https://jsfiddle.net/29h6e7pp/ <--- whats wrong in my syntax?
[05:41:22] <azanc> milka1: 1st google then here you can ank. Cork would reply “don’t ask to ask”
[05:41:36] <azanc> talk*
[05:41:40] <milka1> ok
[05:42:03] <shoky> function(attributes()".nav_ins", ".nav_sel")
[05:42:47] <donm2> hi has anyone worked with Google Maps Api - I want to move marker on the map based on coords from ajax poll - is this possible at all?
[05:43:25] <shoky> donm2: yes
[05:44:37] <donm2> Shoky: is there any pointers on how this can be acchieved ? is it via setPosition ?
[05:46:20] <decx> your marker has a method setPosition
[05:46:27] <decx> you feed it latlng
[05:46:54] <shoky> donm2: sounds right, why don't you try
[05:48:57] <elsevero> what’s the equivalent of var $container = $(‘.container’); using jQuery ?
[05:49:20] <shoky> that looks like jquery, elsevero
[05:49:36] <elsevero> meaning jQuery instead of “$”
[05:49:39] <shoky> or maybe you mean this?  var $container = jQuery('.container')
[05:49:57] <decx> you should never have to do that though even when you noconflict
[05:51:41] <donm2> decx : thanks now I got it.
[05:52:20] <donm2> Shoky - I was trying to read the docs to work it - to see what methods I have to work with.
[05:52:56] <azanc> decx: i’ve EventBreakpoint-ed on the working js fiddle (that enter in Jquery 1.7.2 script ) , and checked it exist on my test page. The 2 resources i think are in conflicts are in these first 2 lines http://pastebin.com/MnYi0x0W
[05:53:23] <shoky> donm2: that's the best way to go
[05:54:48] <decx> you have it working in a fiddle, sort out whatever your backend does and it'll work
[05:55:31] <Silmarilion> is there a way to override jquery ajax before send method?
[05:56:21] <Silmarilion> I want to add some logic which will execute always in beforeSend, for all my ajax requests
[05:57:58] <shoky> `api ajaxSetup
[05:57:58] <b-ot> shoky: No matches.
[05:58:05] <shoky> `api jQuery.ajaxSetup
[05:58:05] <b-ot> shoky: jQuery.ajaxSetup(): Set default values for future Ajax requests. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/
[05:58:43] <azanc> decx: i know i have to do this , the problem is that right now i am not able to “backend” , i am a novice and , even if i ty for your last link, i lost myself in official docs last 2days and a half =/ . Any tip ? (at worse, to contact someone?)
[05:58:47] <Silmarilion> tnx
[06:01:29] <PCatinean> hey guys, I do element.val('bla') but it does not trigger change
[06:01:32] <PCatinean> element is a select
[06:01:37] <PCatinean> and the change event is not triggered
[06:01:40] <PCatinean> any advice?
[06:01:43] <decx> you have to trigger manually when you use val()
[06:01:55] <PCatinean> ah really? any other way I can do to change the val and trigger also?
[06:04:38] <Cork> PCatinean: .val(newValue).trigger('change')
[06:04:44] <PCatinean> ahh ok
[06:04:53] <PCatinean> thank you!
[06:06:10] <Guest6746> could anyone tell me why I dont get the val() of the textbox passed into the method? $('#txtStreetAddress1').dawaautocomplete({ params: { postnr: $('#txtPostalCode').val()
[06:06:37] <cordovafan8> Hello. I am looking for a way to defer the pageshow event firing until after some deferred object resolves. Is there a way to do this? I see some information about preventDefault, but I'm not sure if that stops the page event order completely
[06:11:46] <azanc> decx: “sort out whatever your backend does and it'll work” - other than re-reading http://fixingthesejquery.com/ would you advice me other “more kind of step by step” resources for my spec problem? ty
[06:21:48] <decx> azanc, well this is an integration problem and not a jquery problem, i dont know what your script loader does, i dont know how you load jquery ui. too many unknowns
[06:29:05] <Tennis> Im having problems with removing elements based on obscure ID's
[06:29:16] <Tennis> it was working before with rather obscure ID's
[06:29:33] <Tennis> stuff like id="Martin | 321 "
[06:29:54] <Cork> ouch
[06:30:10] <Tennis> and it was working at selecting and removing the elements with the specific ID but now I'm gettin this error code. Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #Martin Service | 324
[06:30:18] <Cork> $('#Martin\ |\ 321').remove() should work
[06:30:25] <Cork> i think
[06:31:06] <decx> pipes huh, weird
[06:31:36] <Cork> Tennis: http://jsfiddle.net/bvroqyk3/
[06:31:43] <Cork> and lots of spaces
[06:32:11] <decx> haha
[06:32:20] <Tennis> cool so its not the obscurity of the Id's. there's 3 of us working on this and I think someone elses code has broken mine
[06:32:51] <Cork> Tennis: well it looks like someone has abused id as an attribute to store values in
[06:33:07] <Cork> it was rather populare to abuse all defined attributes back in the xhtml days
[06:33:21] <Cork> i've seen both id, rel, class and style abused
[06:33:36] <Cork> (the worst was hands down the style >_<)
[06:33:53] <decx> how do you even use style for that
[06:34:06] <decx> justwrite stuff in there and then element.style to get it?
[06:34:13] <Cork> attr('style')
[06:34:18] <Cork> then split it on {}
[06:34:23] <Cork> and run that through JSON.parse
[06:34:26] <decx> haha
[06:34:34] <decx> that's a paddlin
[06:34:34] <Cork> ya, it was horrible
[06:34:46] <Cork> it spew errors in the console
[06:35:02] <Cork> "unknown property {order_number"
[06:35:13] <Cork> *sigh*
[06:35:54] <Cork> basically ppl did anything to be able to get there old html 4 page validate in xhtml validators
[06:36:06] <Cork> that meant removing order_number="" attributes
[06:36:36] <Cork> (and then they served the page as html anyway so...)
[06:36:40] <decx> well what are you gonna do when you want that sweet 88x31 button
[06:37:24] <Cork> i still wonder what would have happened to xhtml if ie didn't kill it
[06:37:38] <Cork> (ie10 was the first ie browser to fully support it)
[06:37:53] <decx> xtra-html with mandatory blink tags
[06:38:44] <cordovafan8> Why might jquery mobile not respond to clicks for a long time, then suddenly do all the clicks on the next click event?
[06:39:12] <cordovafan8> for instance a page appears unresponsive, so I click aroudn trying things, ..nothing
[06:39:19] <decx> arschmitz ping
[06:39:23] <cordovafan8> then all of a sudden one of the links works
[06:39:41] <cordovafan8> but when i click the link to go back to the page that was unresponsive
[06:40:02] <cordovafan8> I get there briefly, but it takes me to the next link I clicked while it was unresponsive
[06:40:10] <cordovafan8> and so on in a loop
[06:49:19] <HarryMilnes> Hello, I have an issue right now with urls.. I'm trying to apply a url to a background-image using inline styles but when it's appended to the page the url slashs get replaced with spaces
[06:49:28] <HarryMilnes> Has anyone had this issue before?
[06:49:53] <FilipNortic> cordovafan8: do you execute something heavy?
[06:50:11] <Cork> HarryMilnes: could you make a jsfiddle?
[06:50:18] <HarryMilnes> Sure
[06:50:23] <Cork> cause that sounds a bit strange
[06:51:32] <elsevero> anyone used masonry js plugin ?
[06:51:52] <Cork> ?ask @ elsevero
[06:52:02] <Cork> ah, right the info bot is broken
[06:52:11] <Cork> elsevero: don't ask to ask, just ask the question
[06:52:37] <Xatenev> elsevero: ye
[06:52:46] <cordovafan8> FilipNortic: not that I know of
[06:52:51] <decx> `ask
[06:52:51] <b-ot> decx: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:53:07] <Xatenev> ah
[06:53:12] <Xatenev> `paste
[06:53:12] <b-ot> Xatenev: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:53:41] <cordovafan8> FilipNortic: I had an e.preventDefault in my pagebeforeshow to try and defer pageshow, but it seems to have just messed everything up
[06:53:48] <elsevero> Cork: Xatenev: I’d like to update height of a masonry container
[06:53:55] <decx> what was wrong with ? as a marker, i have to jump through hoops to write `
[06:55:38] <Macaveli> Any suggestions on adding an "*" before the <small> tag via jQuery? <label for="personal_info[ZINSS_NUMBER]">Numéro NISS <small>(Ex. 90092313364)</small></label>
[06:56:30] <decx> use css
[06:56:48] <decx> small:before { content: "*" }
[06:57:34] <Macaveli> decx I can't really execute that via jQuery or can I?
[06:57:42] <decx> you write that in your css
[06:57:58] <FilipNortic> cordovafan8: well then there is no general answer you'll have to try and repoduce it in a fiddle
[06:59:31] <juppppp> Hi, i've got a question about jQuery.validation in combination with jQueryUI and unobtrusive
[06:59:34] <cordovafan8> FilipNortic: I think it was just the weird e.preventDefault. But I'm trying to have the pageshow event deferred until after a deferred object
[06:59:40] <Macaveli> decx the * is dependend on other values :)
[06:59:58] <elsevero> Cork: Xatenev: https://www.dropbox.com/s/qsw39q27e6lw4bw/MasonExpand.mov?dl=0
[07:01:26] <HarryMilnes> It works on there but not on my page
[08:01:17] <JulianUU> hello
[08:01:56] <JulianUU> i have a weird parent node problem when cloning a JQM page div with a form inside
[08:02:11] <JulianUU> it would be absolutely fabulous if someone could help me with this :)
[08:08:02] <JulianUU> the problem: the copy of the form inside the clone still has the original page div as its parent element
[08:08:38] <JulianUU> does anyone have any idea what causes this problem or how to solve it?
[08:13:32] <JulianUU> strangely, i only get the wrong parent when i ask for it inside my scripts… when i try asking .parent() from the console, i get the correct answer
[08:19:19] <JulianUU> but i now realise i should ask this another time when i have more time to wait for the answer
[08:19:44] <decx> there's rarely people giving support for jqm unless arschmitz is around
[08:19:59] <JulianUU> oh thanks for pointing that out
[08:20:10] <arschmitz> decx: im always around if you ask
[08:20:20] <JulianUU> oh
[08:20:21] <arschmitz> or will be back soon
[08:20:24] <decx> that was a camouflaged ping
[08:20:25] <decx> ^^
[08:20:29] <arschmitz> lol
[08:20:55] <JulianUU> arschmitz, could you help me with the problem i described above?
[08:21:39] <arschmitz> JulianUU: i would need some sort of code example of what your doing
[08:21:48] <arschmitz> because what your describing does not seem correct
[08:22:00] <JulianUU> i would hope it isn’t correct :P
[08:22:06] <arschmitz> lol
[08:22:23] <arschmitz> could you make a simple jsbin example or similar i could look at?
[08:22:55] <arschmitz> JulianUU: i have some vague ideas of what your issue could be but with out some idea of exactly what your doing in terms of calls i cant say
[08:23:49] <JulianUU> well maybe i can just type some very brief example code in here (i’m absolutely willing to do something a bit more elaborate, but not now because work ended officially 25 minutes ago)
[08:24:12] <arschmitz> JulianUU: could you at least put the code in a gist instead
[08:24:15] <arschmitz> much easier to read
[08:25:14] <JulianUU> ok, but it won’t be working code yet
[08:25:18] <arschmitz> thats fine
[08:30:28] <arschmitz> JulianUU: i need to run to the store ill be back in 15-20 minutes
[08:30:57] <JulianUU> aww that’s a shame… but ok i’ll wait
[08:36:25] <JulianUU> arschmitz: https://gist.github.com/jgonggrijp/1b581f19a79913d94aba
[08:39:03] <JulianUU> arschmitz: i’m getting tea now, should be back within 6 minutes
[08:42:33] <shoky> JulianUU: you're not passing the event object to diagnostics().. and you shouldn't be using on__ attributes
[08:43:16] <JulianUU> that’s a mistake in the gist, not in my code
[08:43:28] <JulianUU> but thanks for having a look at it :)
[08:43:49] <shoky> well.. show your code then if you want us to find mistakes in it and not in your gist ;p
[08:44:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[08:44:27] <Xatenev> shoky: rofl
[08:44:42] <JulianUU> very funny, but you would get lost in my code, i would have to reduce it to something compact first and i don’t have time for that now
[08:44:53] <shoky> ok let's find mistakes in your gist then
[08:44:55] <Xatenev> JulianUU: Well but thats how u create a testcase
[08:44:58] <robertmaxrees> JulianUU that's generally what we ask for - a test case.
[08:45:02] <Xatenev> :)
[08:45:06] <robertmaxrees> you reduce everything down to the actual problem you're having.
[08:45:19] <JulianUU> i know that
[08:45:35] <JulianUU> i was hoping i could cheat a little now
[08:46:02] <JulianUU> arschmitz said he/she had an idea what it might be, i hope my gist could be enough for now to confirm that suspicion
[08:47:02] <shoky> JulianUU: anyway even adding the event to the call it seems to work fine http://jsfiddle.net/08nssk0c/   no JQM here of course, though your issue doesn't sound jqm-related
[08:48:31] <arschmitz> JulianUU: yeah im with shoky here that looks right ( after changes he mentions ) and nothing in jqm should effect that
[08:48:43] <jcrawford> anyone that can tell me why the error is being triggered from an ajax call? I put the url in my browser and it works just fine outputting the json data... http://jsbin.com/jupamesaka/1/edit?html,console,output
[08:49:34] <jcrawford> i get no error message just "" and xhr.status = 0 when debugging
[08:50:01] <JulianUU> sigh alright i understand i’ll have to create a reduced testcase
[08:50:08] <JulianUU> see you again next week
[08:50:13] <robertmaxrees> what
[08:50:16] <robertmaxrees> i'm making one for you now.
[08:50:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[08:50:39] <JulianUU> lol that’s a joke i suppose?
[08:50:47] <JulianUU> or do you know the problem?
[08:50:55] <robertmaxrees> this is a pretty simple test case to make.
[08:51:04] <robertmaxrees> not sure why you think it's so difficult.
[08:51:17] <JulianUU> it takes time
[08:51:19] <arschmitz> robertmaxrees: ha ha i was making into one too
[08:51:31] <shoky> what's wrong with mine ;(
[08:51:35] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/f08L1reg/1/
[08:51:36] <shoky> oh no jqm
[08:51:47] <robertmaxrees> err http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/f08L1reg/2/
[08:51:50] <JulianUU> i have hundreds of lines of code and i need to figure out what lines need to be included so i can leave out everything else
[08:52:00] <robertmaxrees> JulianUU look at what i just pasted.
[08:52:00] <JulianUU> and my workday ended 50 minutes ago
[08:52:03] <jcrawford> i could use some assistance too with an ajax request posted above, that's a working sample showing the error or lack of error received :D
[08:52:20] <robertmaxrees> jcrawford one sec.
[08:52:34] <jcrawford> robertmaxrees: no worries thank you :D
[08:52:39] <JulianUU> robertmaxrees: thanks but the button in the cloned form doesn’t log anything
[08:53:18] <robertmaxrees> JulianUU i was late to the party, buuuut....
[08:53:35] <robertmaxrees> that's just giving you an example of what a reduced test case might look like.
[08:53:44] <JulianUU> also, it’s really nice that you guys are trying to create a test case for me, but shouldn’t it be based on my code and reveal the same error i’m experiencing?
[08:53:47] <robertmaxrees> not sure what actual problem you're having.  just pointing you in the right direction :)
[08:54:02] <JulianUU> i know what a test case is
[08:54:10] <JulianUU> i was just trying whether i could skip that work
[08:54:10] <shoky> jcrawford: you're getting a cross-domain error, issue with your cors header
[08:54:16] <JulianUU> it turned out i couldn’t, my bad
[08:54:31] <jcrawford> hmm makes sense from the bin but i am getting nothing on my local server which is not xdomain
[08:54:42] <jcrawford> the ajax isn't even firing there, which is odd in itself
[08:54:49] <JulianUU> robertmaxrees: see above
[08:54:51] <arschmitz> JulianUU: if your around for a few minutes im almost done with a real test case

[08:55:00] <robertmaxrees> JulianUU i can read ;)
[08:55:11] <robertmaxrees> jcrawford i'm getting an empty response from your server on a fiddle.
[08:55:15] <JulianUU> robertmaxrees: alright just wan’t sure whether you had seen it
[08:55:23] <robertmaxrees> jcrawford it's a CORS issue.
[08:55:31] <shoky> jcrawford: you have this header twice:  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
[08:55:32] <decx> man julianuu just struck the support motherlode, shoky, robertmaxrees AND arschmitz
[08:55:34] <jcrawford> robertmaxrees: even when on the same domain/server?
[08:55:38] <shoky> jcrawford: seems that's the problem
[08:55:42] <robertmaxrees> decx++
[08:55:49] <shoky> heh
[08:56:02] <jcrawford> shoky: you mean in the server response or the request?
[08:56:08] <shoky> jcrawford: response
[08:56:19] <robertmaxrees> jcrawford http://jcrawford.heytix.com/mobile_ticket/?security_code=65147508c1 - the response is an entire page, not some JSON.
[08:56:36] <jcrawford> right, that's the HTML page that does the ajax request robertmaxrees
[08:56:49] <robertmaxrees> the xhr is pulling the entire page.
[08:56:50] <robertmaxrees> not json.
[08:56:52] <jcrawford> the url for the data that the ajax request calls is http://jcrawford.heytix.com/guestlist/checkin/api/tickets/qrcode/65147508c1
[08:57:26] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing that request fire.
[08:57:34] <JulianUU> arschmitz: i’m grateful that you’re trying to do the work of creating the test case for me
[08:57:36] <shoky> jcrawford:  The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header contains multiple values '*, *', but only one is allowed.
[08:57:48] <arschmitz> JulianUU: well one major problem right off
[08:57:52] <jcrawford> ok checking into that now
[08:58:04] <robertmaxrees> jcrawford also you're using an ancient version of jquery.
[08:58:10] <arschmitz> when you copy the page your doing it post enhancement so your cloning and appending a visible page
[08:58:14] <JulianUU> but in case it’s going to turn out not to represent my problem, please let it rest for now… i’m starting to be convinced i’ll have to create a testcase myself
[08:58:15] <jcrawford> robertmaxrees: correct nor was I hence why i went to the bin then saw it firing there and getting the coors issue :D
[08:58:19] <arschmitz> so after you have 2 visible pages
[08:58:26] <jcrawford> robertmaxrees: nah i just selected that in the drop down
[08:58:36] <JulianUU> arschmitz: i clone while the page is invisible, forgot to mention that
[08:58:38] <jcrawford> with .ajax doubt the version matters it's been around since forever
[08:58:41] <JulianUU> but yes, post-enhancement
[08:58:45] <robertmaxrees> jcrawford http://jcrawford.heytix.com/mobile_ticket/?security_code=65147508c1 this page uses an ancient version.
[08:58:55] <jcrawford> ah heh yea
[08:59:00] <jcrawford> not up to date
[08:59:02] <arschmitz> JulianUU: you cant clone a page post enhancment
[08:59:11] <arschmitz> there is data stored durring enhancment
[08:59:12] <robertmaxrees> arschmitz++
[08:59:20] <arschmitz> and now that data is pointing to the original pagr still
[08:59:26] <JulianUU> aha, now we’re talking
[08:59:31] <JulianUU> so what should i do instead?
[08:59:44] <shoky> "onsubmit" is enhanced?
[08:59:49] <arschmitz> no
[08:59:54] <JulianUU> no, #original
[09:00:00] <shoky> welp
[09:00:09] <arschmitz> and he is clonging #original
[09:00:09] <JulianUU> that’s a JQM thing, for the record
[09:00:23] <shoky> onsubmit is?
[09:00:28] <JulianUU> no, enhancement
[09:00:30] <arschmitz> no before onsubmit
[09:00:31] <shoky> ah k
[09:00:59] <JulianUU> lol
[09:01:03] <arschmitz> JulianUU: why are you cloneing the page to begin with is my first question
[09:01:40] <JulianUU> because i have two pages with the same layout, but with different functions and linked from different places in the navigation hierarchy
[09:01:50] <w0jt_> Hi. I try to use csv file with select2 plugin. I've got this file localy in the same path as index.html. Is there any way to use data from that file using Select2 in index.html?
[09:02:07] <robertmaxrees> JulianUU then you need to treat them as separate pages.
[09:02:22] <JulianUU> it’s also convenient if they can hold different data (dynamically loaded) in parallel
[09:02:23] <robertmaxrees> w0jt_ not without a webserver.
[09:02:35] <JulianUU> robertmaxrees: so i should duplicate a lot of html code?
[09:02:44] <robertmaxrees> JulianUU you should use a templating system.
[09:02:51] <robertmaxrees> that's what they're for.
[09:03:19] <JulianUU> can’t, it’s going to be wrapped up in a phonegap application so it has to be entirely static html
[09:03:41] <robertmaxrees> if you can use javascript, you can use a templating system :)
[09:03:46] <robertmaxrees> even underscore has one.
[09:04:13] <JulianUU> ah there you have a point :)
[09:04:17] <JulianUU> i’ll look into that, thanks
[09:04:31] <robertmaxrees> do that instead.  much better choice than cloning elements.
[09:04:34] <flashpoint9> It's been a sec since I wan in js, I am trying to get an image height from a div and then set the height attribute of that div with the images height, there are multiple divs on one page, here is the code I have but it is setting the same height for all divs, can anyone help with that? http://dpaste.com/385DB65
[09:04:45] <JulianUU> still, i wonder what would be the way to clone it without problems? i mean, just out of interest
[09:04:48] <w0jt_> robertmaxrees: thanks
[09:05:01] <arschmitz> JulianUU: so my suggestion is a template
[09:05:09] <arschmitz> even if its just in your js file and not a whole system
[09:05:12] <arschmitz> however
[09:05:17] <JulianUU> yes i’ll try that route, thanks
[09:05:20] <arschmitz> if you really really want to clone
[09:05:32] <robertmaxrees> JulianUU you'd have to do a lot of gross .clone(true, true) recursive stuff i'm guessing.
[09:05:38] <arschmitz> do it in before you load jquery mobile
[09:05:54] <arschmitz> and store it in a var
[09:05:56] <robertmaxrees> flashpoint9 you want  $(this).height(backgroundImageHeight); i'm guessing.
[09:05:57] <shoky> flashpoint9: sounds like you want to use $(this)  inside myfunction to get only the stuff relevant to the current element its running on
[09:06:29] <flashpoint9> Ok ill give that a try, thanks
[09:06:30] <shoky> e.g. $(this).find('.field-whatever').attr('height')
[09:06:35] <JulianUU> arschmitz: that sounds tricky! JQM is included in the head, the page itself is in the body, so i can’t really clone the page before JQM loads?
[09:06:53] <arschmitz> sure you can
[09:07:05] <arschmitz> put a script before jqm that runs on document ready
[09:07:08] <JulianUU> robertmaxrees: i tried .clone(true, true) but to no avail
[09:07:12] <arschmitz> it will do exactly what you want
[09:07:36] <JulianUU> but how do i know it will outrun JQM’s ready handler?
[09:08:10] <robertmaxrees> JulianUU right, notice my extra bit about needing to do a bunch of recursive work for that to happen right.
[09:08:38] <arschmitz> JulianUU: first in first out
[09:08:38] <JulianUU> ok point taken, that sounds arduous indeed :)
[09:08:44] <arschmitz> jqm needs to wait for doc ready too
[09:08:52] <arschmitz> and if you register your handler first
[09:08:54] <arschmitz> it runs first
[09:09:08] <JulianUU> that’s great, i didn’t know JS offered that guarantee
[09:09:16] <arschmitz> js is sync
[09:09:53] <JulianUU> ok i think i know enough for now
[09:10:03] <JulianUU> thanks a lot folks :)
[09:10:13] <JulianUU> especially robertmaxrees and arschmitz of course
[09:10:36] <arschmitz> JulianUU: glad i could help
[09:10:49] <flashpoint9> shoky: I got it working with this code, thanks :) http://dpaste.com/15AY6R5
[09:10:51] <JulianUU> i’ll report back next week to let you know how i ended up solving this
[09:11:21] <shoky> flashpoint9: uhm no probs. that code doesn't seem to be doing much though :P
[09:11:45] <flashpoint9> yea, I can do a lot more with js, its just my lack of mastery of 'this'
[09:11:56] <flashpoint9> always gave me trouble
[09:11:56] <shoky> heh i just mean, the code you pasted doesn't do anything
[09:12:01] <robertmaxrees> flashpoint9 'this' is the invocation context.
[09:12:20] <flashpoint9> oh shoot
[09:12:24] <flashpoint9> back to the drawing board
[09:13:09] <robertmaxrees> jquery likes binding 'this' to the element you're working with.
[09:21:06] <flashpoint9> shoky: http://dpaste.com/0ZX46WE
[09:21:17] <flashpoint9> That is working now, thanks for the input
[09:21:46] <robertmaxrees> flashpoint9 you could move that .each() into the plugin btw :)
[09:22:13] <shoky> flashpoint9 that still doesn't do anything except console.log ;p
[09:22:48] <flashpoint9> shoky: ah yes, but it is returning the right values, ill set it with attr
[09:22:57] <flashpoint9> robertmaxrees: thanks ill refactor! :)
[09:23:11] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/0gqomlw/ like so.
[09:23:27] <flashpoint9> robertmaxrees: sweet!
[09:37:47] <Mathuin> I have a question about qtip1 (no, I can't upgrade right now) and Selenium.  I have a Django app that uses a qtip as a loading icon, and I want to write a test that does something _after_ the qtip is hidden, but I don't know how to write the selenium test.  Suggestions?
[09:38:22] <robertmaxrees> selenium allows you to force a wait last i checked.
[09:38:29] <robertmaxrees> it's not elegant but it's there.
[09:38:32] <Mathuin> I dont' know the locator upon which to force the wait.
[09:38:47] <robertmaxrees> i thought you could just say "wait"
[09:39:17] <Mathuin> The 'wait' only waits for the page itself to load.
[09:39:29] <Mathuin> The page finishes loading, but the javascript is doing stuff.
[09:39:37] <Mathuin> While the javascript is doing stuff, the loading icon is displayed.
[09:39:43] <Mathuin> I can't click on anything else until the icon goes away.
[09:39:50] <robertmaxrees> i thought htere was a "wait x seconds" option.
[09:40:11] <Mathuin> I have only seen "wait until this thing is done".
[09:40:45] <Mathuin> http://pgd.science.oregonstate.edu/search/ if you're interested, click 'submit' at the bottom, see the pretty plot, click 'Statistics', and you'll see the qtip of which I speak.
[09:42:43] <robertmaxrees> https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/ExpectedConditions.html#presenceOfElementLocated-org.openqa.selenium.By-
[09:42:47] <robertmaxrees> can't you just wait.until(ExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocated(By.cssSelector(".qtipTHinger")));
[09:43:39] <robertmaxrees> i could be totally off base though.  our QA team has a few different libs at play sooo.
[09:44:16] <Mathuin> I don't know much javascript, I do Python normally. :-)
[09:44:26] <robertmaxrees> except selenium is Java ;)
[09:44:46] <Mathuin> selenium is, but I use the Python bindings and PhantomJS to get stuff done.
[09:44:50] <Mathuin> It's a mess, all around. :-)
[09:46:07] <Mathuin> The qtip is referenced in the template as $('#stats').qtip and it is hidden by using $('#stats').qtip('hide') but nothing else shows up in the HTML side of things.
[09:46:33] <Mathuin> If qtip 2 is a drop-in replacement *and* there's an easy answer on how to test for presence and absence of a qtip in Selenium, that'd be worth doing righ tnow.
[09:50:44] <robertmaxrees> Mathuin i'd try #selenium
[09:51:15] <Mathuin> Okay, I'll do that.  I'll lurk in here in case I end up upgrading to qtip2.
[09:51:37] <robertmaxrees> should be a pretty easy update.
[09:51:55] <Mathuin> Nothing has been easy with this app.  The production instance is running Django 1.3.7 still. :-)
[09:52:38] <robertmaxrees> heh, i'd rather that then coldfusion ;)
[09:53:58] <Mathuin> Indeed.
[10:14:14] <bttf> I'm trying to figure out how to recreate this effect for my website: http://metcreative.com/demo_viewer/index.php?theme=santone
[10:14:36] <bttf> It seems like a combination of fadein, and animating css position?
[10:15:02] <robertmaxrees> pretty much.
[10:17:34] <ceramicskulls> Anybody in here work with Foundation's data-equalizer?
[10:21:11] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskulls maybe not but that doesn't mean we can't help :)
[10:23:22] <ceramicskulls> Hey robertmaxrees ! Alright, I'll throw it out there: http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/equalizer.html - Visit this page and resize it to under 900px, then scroll to "responsive equalizer", the panels do not stay the same height even though they're suppose to?
[10:24:56] <robertmaxrees> looks like a media query problem?
[10:25:20] <uskerine> hi, I have a tiemstamp string that was created with moment using moment().format('DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm'). Is it possible to reformat that to 'DD/MMMM/YYYY HH:mm' ?
[10:26:05] <ceramicskulls> Well, it's being created through JS
[10:26:06] <ceramicskulls> https://github.com/zurb/foundation/blob/master/js/foundation/foundation.equalizer.js
[10:27:07] <ceramicskulls> maybe it is a query problem, I'll keep digging into it, but I was just wondering if anybody else knew how to fix this issue before I spent time looking into it lol
[10:27:18] <decx> it does what it's supposed to
[10:27:28] <decx> qualize containers on large up which is 1025
[10:27:33] <decx> equalze
[10:28:33] <ceramicskulls> Yea, but I set it to medium-up and it's still the same issue
[10:29:13] <ceramicskulls> the css gets switched to "height: inherit;"
[10:33:42] <cordovafan8> I have a very general question: What are some common pitfalls that might make a jq/jqm app slow down when doing changepage or ajax? Somehow I think I've made a speed regression in my code and I have no idea where to start
[10:34:26] <robertmaxrees> is the ajax being run synchronously?
[10:34:38] <robertmaxrees> are you doing a lot of DOM manipulation on page instead of against a fragment?
[10:34:44] <robertmaxrees> are you doing a lot of intensive operations?
[10:35:26] <cordovafan8> so I've removed the sync call
[10:35:36] <cordovafan8> but I'm still getting a slowdown
[10:35:51] <robertmaxrees> have you tried profiling to see where your code is spending the most time?
[10:36:36] <cordovafan8> other than console.log. no, is there an easy way to do that via console?
[10:36:55] <robertmaxrees> what browser are you in?
[10:37:21] <robertmaxrees> because all major modern browsers I can think of all have some kind of profiling tool available.
[10:37:56] <cordovafan8> chrome
[10:38:59] <cordovafan8> oh I can record cpu profiles
[10:39:02] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.chrome.com/devtools#timeline
[10:39:03] <robertmaxrees> also this.
[10:43:02] <cordovafan8> hrmm can't get anything to show up there
[10:43:43] <robertmaxrees> you have to hit "record"
[10:43:45] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/timeline
[10:43:57] <robertmaxrees> also this: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/profiles
[10:44:44] <cordovafan8> oh duh
[10:44:57] <cordovafan8> it looks like a grey circle, had no idea it was record
[10:46:28] <cordovafan8> thanks
[10:46:32] <cordovafan8> by the way robertmaxrees
[10:46:44] <cordovafan8> I am trying your deferred suggestion
[10:46:58] <cordovafan8> but it doesn't rendeer the page correctly because I can't defer the pageshow event
[10:47:03] <cordovafan8> so I have to abandon it
[10:47:22] <cordovafan8> unfortunate, because it is nice
[11:06:05] <combilombi> Hi, I'm having trouble with a userscript. I wish to remove all the <wbr> elements from a webpage before having another function run on the changed content however it fails when it comes to try to read what was once a wbr element. I've tried using a callback and even just delaying the second function with setTimeout but the problem persists. I was originally using the extension tampermonkey to run the script on the page but have 
[11:06:07] <combilombi> -after being unable to reproduce the bug when running it in a jsfiddle. Here's the relevant section of the code I'm using: http://pastebin.com/tH24t0ds
[11:09:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:10:23] <robertmaxrees> your question cut off.  try distilling it down to like 2 sentences.
[11:10:47] <uskerine> if an <input> value is changed while it is part of a hidden div, does it changes its value?
[11:11:04] <robertmaxrees> uskerine should, yeah.
[11:11:07] <uskerine> ok thanks
[11:11:11] <uskerine> it is another issue then
[11:11:36] <kevireilly> uskerine: should be able to inspect the present value in dev tools after changing it to verify
[11:11:50] <robertmaxrees> depending on how you're changing it, you can't do that.
[11:11:51] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[11:12:05] <uskerine> that's good idea
[11:12:07] <uskerine> thanks
[11:13:15] <robertmaxrees> except that doesn't work...
[11:13:27] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/45VfrZ4.png
[11:14:09] <kevireilly> oh! obviously not what i was expecting haha
[11:14:14] <robertmaxrees> :)
[11:16:12] <combilombi> robertmaxrees: Erm... I guess the best way to distill it is to say that to my knowledge $('wbr').remove() should complete before another function runs after it, yet when the second function does run it fails in a way that would suggest it had been using the original page content
[11:16:37] <robertmaxrees> what suggests that?
[11:17:46] <combilombi> That when it logs the node list in the console it returns 'undefined' for what was originally a wbr node, before trying to do stuff with it and failing.
[11:18:33] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see an example of it failing to understand what the issue is.
[11:20:33] <combilombi> robertmaxrees: that's fair. Erm... Are you willing to run it as a userscript? As I said, the issue doesn't occur when running it in a fiddle
[11:20:42] <robertmaxrees> i guess?
[11:22:17] <kevireilly> robertmaxrees: interesting, it is part of the HTML spec and totally makes sense since `value` would commonly be the default value. Nice lil caveat. But yeah logging the present value definitetly works
[11:22:41] <robertmaxrees> kevireilly and jquery edits the DOM, instead of the markup.
[11:22:48] <robertmaxrees> that's how i normally think of it.
[11:23:37] <combilombi> robertmaxrees: Thanks, here's the script: http://pastebin.com/CaiLNa9w which you'll want to run using your browser's equivalent of greasemonkey. An page to run it on is: http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/37584364/
[11:24:29] <robertmaxrees> wat
[11:24:49] <robertmaxrees> fwiw jquery isn't available on that page.
[11:25:22] <kevireilly> robertmaxrees: adding attributes and what not are reflected though
[11:25:31] <robertmaxrees> kevireilly if you use .attr()
[11:25:35] <robertmaxrees> .prop() on the other hand...
[11:25:39] <combilombi> The userscript pulls it in with the // @require line
[11:26:10] <kevireilly> robertmaxrees: yeah hrm, same with .data
[11:26:21] <robertmaxrees> .data() caches data elsewhere to keep things speedy
[11:26:23] <ceramicskulls> decx still here? http://jsbin.com/qizuzeliyo/1/edit?html,output
[11:26:33] <robertmaxrees> combilombi this is some unusual code.
[11:26:41] <robertmaxrees> $.each($(v)[0].childNodes, function(index, node) {
[11:26:50] <robertmaxrees> why not use a recursive function to do what you want instead?
[11:27:02] <kevireilly> robertmaxrees: hrm .prop(‘class’, ‘foo’) worked though not a great idea
[11:27:33] <combilombi> It's more than likely that I'm utterly failing to abide by best practises...
[11:29:46] <robertmaxrees> so what are you actually trying to do here?
[11:30:12] <combilombi> What do you mean? It is recursive. It takes the post content element and iterates through the child nodes, if they're a text node then it checks if it contains zalgotext and wraps it accordingly, if it's not then it calls the function on the element
[11:30:22] <robertmaxrees> that's not recursive.
[11:30:24] <snopt> how to test jQuery code?
[11:31:00] <robertmaxrees> oh i see where you're doing that now.
[11:31:05] <combilombi> Well, overall goal is wrap any zalgotext (or other unusual charactersets later on) with pertinent tags
[11:31:09] <robertmaxrees> snopt whatcha mean?
[11:31:19] <robertmaxrees> combilombi ... why?
[11:31:38] <robertmaxrees> you're aware you can't technically create random tags, right?
[11:33:18] <snopt> robertmaxrees: I do jquery site development and try to run unit tests but doesnt work
[11:33:32] <robertmaxrees> snopt which unit tests?
[11:33:44] <combilombi> Sure, it's actually just to put the page in a better state for a program someone else is writing to parse and convert to LaTeX with the intention of making an ebook. The <zalgo> tag is to provide their program with a way to easily recognise and convert it since zalgotext just loses the odd characters otherwise
[11:33:59] <snopt> "node: command not found"
[11:34:06] <snopt> when running mocha
[11:34:20] <robertmaxrees> snopt sounds like you need to get mocha support then.  maybe try #mocha?
[11:34:31] <robertmaxrees> hrm not an actual channel.
[11:34:35] <arthurvr> snopt: Pretty much has it right into the error message, nodejs isn’t installed on your system.
[11:34:41] <arthurvr> try #node.js
[11:34:43] <gtristan> snopt, random tidbit I've been running into...
[11:34:50] <robertmaxrees> ^ there you go.
[11:34:57] <gtristan> snopt, is some systems install node.js as the wrong thing
[11:35:04] <combilombi> It's not to make the page itself more readable or somesuch (though the created tags can be used to recolour the text with css to act as a visual indicator of it's success)
[11:35:07] <gtristan> or fail to install a symlink to it as /usr/bin/node
[11:35:17] <snopt> arthurvr: reccomended way to download it?
[11:35:38] <arthurvr> snopt: I could answer that but jQuery relatence is zero so let’s move to #node.js.
[11:36:18] <snopt> Understood
[11:36:26] <snopt> will PM you, arthurvr
[11:36:29] <arthurvr> please don't
[11:36:45] <snopt> node.js then?
[11:36:50] <arthurvr> #node.js, yes :)
[11:36:53] <robertmaxrees> combilombi http://fixee.org/paste/lskcjaq/ try this real quick.
[11:36:55] <snopt> okay then
[11:37:02] <snopt> bye
[11:37:13] <arthurvr> seeya snopt
[11:38:23] <combilombi> robertmaxrees: that fails in the same manner
[11:38:50] <combilombi> (and was essentially what I originally tried to do before using callbacks or delays)
[11:39:14] <uskerine> despite you can change the value of a input element when it is hidden, when using bootstrap dialog, you must change it once it has been shown (function onshown instead of with function onshow), for some reason it does not work it you change it during "onshow"
[11:39:29] <uskerine> if*
[11:39:45] <robertmaxrees> uskerine iirc bootstrap clones the original element and shows the cloned version instead.
[11:39:49] <robertmaxrees> i could have that wrong though.
[11:39:51] <combilombi> On that note, my understanding was that $('wbr').remove(); should complete fully before the next like of code is executed. Is this true?
[11:40:04] <robertmaxrees> combilombi yes.
[11:40:30] <uskerine> that would explain it
[11:40:41] <uskerine> I also had a rough time to discover autodestroy: false
[11:41:21] <ceramicskulls> robertmaxrees - actually found a bug
[11:41:26] <ceramicskulls> : l
[11:41:38] <robertmaxrees> with what?
[11:41:41] <snopt> interview question lately: how many different ways to do a document.ready using jQuery are there?
[11:41:54] <robertmaxrees> snopt easy
[11:42:04] <arthurvr> snopt: TBH, that’s a stupid interview question.
[11:42:05] <ceramicskulls> The issue I came in asking about earlier - just spoke with some one over at the zurb-foundation channel and definitely a bug lol
[11:42:14] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskulls well there you go.
[11:42:21] <shoky> only appropriate answer is *rolls eyes*
[11:42:37] <snopt> arthurvr: robertmaxrees: if it's that easy, how many? I can come up with quite a bit.
[11:42:48] <shoky> infinity, or thereabouts
[11:43:02] <robertmaxrees> snopt 3 for the "official" ones.
[11:44:03] <snopt> robertmaxress: which ones? jQuery(fn), jQuery(document).ready() and?
[11:44:36] <robertmaxrees> $(function() {});, $(document).ready(function(){});, and technically $().ready(function() {});
[11:45:01] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/ready/ "All three of the following syntaxes are equivalent:" - check out that bit.
[11:45:32] <arthurvr> $.when($.ready).then(fn) is another one :) but hey, as I said, stupid questsion.
[11:45:39] <arthurvr> and I can’t spell
[11:45:49] <robertmaxrees> arthurvr hah, that's right they promisified it.
[11:47:34] <snopt> wow fancy one arthurvr
[11:47:51] <snopt> why the **** would I use that signature lol
[11:48:00] <robertmaxrees> because promises are awesome.
[11:48:12] <arthurvr> ^
[11:49:04] <snopt> 4 then?
[11:49:12] <robertmaxrees> at least.
[11:49:18] <robertmaxrees> there are other options.
[11:49:30] <robertmaxrees> it's kind of a silly question tbh.
[11:49:51] <arthurvr> if you only count the ones considered as ”official” yes (from what I can tell). If you scroll through the source of that module in jQuery core you’ll see that there are plenty of other ways.
[11:49:54] <arthurvr> though, exactly what robertmaxrees said.
[11:50:09] <arthurvr> wouldn’t know why that question would make sense to anyone.
[11:50:14] <uskerine> there are much more stupid questions
[11:50:33] <arthurvr> yeah some interviewers just tend to ask stupid questions.
[11:50:34] <uskerine> "where would you like to be in the next 5 years?"
[11:51:23] <arthurvr> Well, there’s at least some kind of thinking behind that one.
[11:51:34] <snopt> another question?
[11:51:36] <snopt> qunit related?
[11:52:04] <shoky> ?
[11:53:10] <snopt> why doesn't my assert.notOk work fine (chrome on windows)
[11:53:14] <arthurvr> version of qunit?
[11:53:23] <snopt> 0.17 out of the top of my mind
[11:53:27] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/commit/f61926d3c45fc511842a8b04139afa044ad60636
[11:53:37] <arthurvr> available since 0.18.
[11:54:10] <snopt> this arthurvr is a hero
[11:56:49] <snopt> why isn't that mentioned on the API docs page? Do I open a ticket at the qunit trac tracker?
[11:56:58] <arthurvr> 1 minute
[11:57:21] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/api.qunitjs.com/issues/98
[11:58:34] <snopt> I don't know how you do this but you rock arthurv.
[11:58:40] <arthurvr> yw snopt
[11:58:45] <snopt> more questions?
[11:58:58] <arthurvr> I gotta leave but there’s still a 759 others in here ;)
[11:59:02] <arthurvr> ask away
[12:05:54] <uskerine> a bit offtopic but still a good place to ask: I am noticing that modifying HTML and using CTRL+F5 to get the updated .html does not always work, any idea why that might happen?
[12:20:35] <combilombi> robertmaxrees: Anyway, do you have any suggestions for what might be causing the issue? I tend to just look through forum answers to solve the problems I run into but I really don't know where to start in this instance
[12:26:04] <Guest13> Hey all, trying to get autocomplete to work with text that may have entities in it, I have the list showing proper now by extending the render function, but when clicking item in list it adds to the search box with entities
[12:26:06] <Guest13> https://gist.github.com/4895686a5d81717ec6d1
[14:52:34] <rejns> here's jsfiddle example http://jsfiddle.net/CVrFU/, i need to know why blueorder and bluetext function have after changing css return this
[14:55:04] <rejns> please help
[15:01:22] <robertmaxrees> lookin'
[15:01:33] <rejns> ty
[15:01:54] <robertmaxrees> simply you want to know why it has return this; ?
[15:01:59] <rejns> yes
[15:02:00] <rejns> at the end
[15:02:06] <rejns> of the function
[15:02:10] <rejns> im new to programming
[15:02:46] <rejns> maybe it's silly question
[15:02:49] <robertmaxrees> check this out: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/CVrFU/620/
[15:02:57] <robertmaxrees> see the issue?
[15:03:23] <rejns> i see that but i dont get it why
[15:03:46] <rejns> css is changed in the function
[15:03:55] <rejns> why it has to return each object
[15:04:05] <robertmaxrees> notice how the text doesn't change in my version?
[15:04:09] <robertmaxrees> just the border?
[15:04:11] <rejns> yes
[15:04:53] <robertmaxrees> 'this' is kind of complicated, but basically, when inside a plugin it refers to whatever you selected.
[15:05:25] <robertmaxrees> if you don't return it, the next thing you try to chain into that plugin (like blueText() ) can't run.
[15:05:39] <robertmaxrees> because if you don't return anything, there's nothing to run it on.
[15:06:00] <rejns> this in this case means each div right?
[15:06:23] <robertmaxrees> in this case, the 'this' object is what was retuyrned by $('.blue')
[15:07:32] <rejns> so
[15:07:38] <rejns> if there was no chain
[15:08:02] <rejns> moment
[15:08:10] <rejns> ...
[15:08:18] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:08:32] <rejns> oh
[15:08:33] <rejns> i get it
[15:08:39] <rejns> if there was no chain
[15:08:46] <rejns> there's no need tor return
[15:08:48] <rejns> this
[15:08:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah, if you didn't want to chain the methods, you don't return anything.
[15:08:53] <robertmaxrees> BUT!
[15:09:03] <uskerine> I have a bootstrap dialog which uses a hidden DOM form. That hidden DOM form includes AJAX submit button and it displays another Bootstrap Dialog to specify that "user has been updated". Is it possible to close the first dialog (the one which used the DOM form) once the user clicks on the second one?
[15:09:16] <robertmaxrees> most jquery plugins return this; or something like it because that's the convention.
[15:09:46] <rejns> i see it works
[15:09:50] <rejns> with or without
[15:09:55] <rejns> so there's no loss
[15:09:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:09:58] <rejns> if we return
[15:10:02] <rejns> this
[15:10:15] <rejns> if there's no chain of course
[15:10:16] <robertmaxrees> right - if you stop returning this, things will break if you try to method chain.
[15:10:28] <robertmaxrees> that's a really common pattern
[15:10:30] <rejns> man, i'm really grateful for this
[15:11:01] <robertmaxrees> uskerine check the bootstrap docs - there's a way to close modals programatically.
[15:11:30] <rejns> that's my first time using irc... ill be back for more :)
[15:11:36] <rejns> thank you again
[15:11:49] <uskerine> uhm I think I have to create the dialog first, assign it a name and then .show and .hide it
[15:11:55] <robertmaxrees> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals-methods
[15:12:01] <robertmaxrees> right, you need to be able to target it.
[15:12:09] <robertmaxrees> but otherwise, you just .modal('hide')
[15:12:29] <uskerine> actually I am using this dialog,  http://nakupanda.github.io/bootstrap3-dialog/
[15:12:37] <uskerine> I am not 100% sure if it is the same as in standard bootstrap or not
[15:13:09] <robertmaxrees> then you just do .hide();
[15:16:10] <noober03> can someone please tell me why my change is not firing when i upload a file by clicking on the image? http://jsfiddle.net/tk7okgtr/
[15:16:47] <robertmaxrees> don't use online event handlers for one.
[15:18:41] <robertmaxrees> noober03 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tk7okgtr/1/
[15:18:47] <robertmaxrees> you want something like this instead.
[15:20:52] <uskerine> I finally did this robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/1dr9KbwX
[15:20:53] <noober03> not sure why but the alert is not working
[15:21:00] <uskerine> so in the second dialog I can refer to the first one and close it too
[15:21:01] <robertmaxrees> noober03 open your console.
[15:21:04] <robertmaxrees> it explains it.
[15:21:41] <robertmaxrees> noober03 the first issue was that the function isn't defined before you try to use it, so it breaks.
[15:21:49] <robertmaxrees> that's also why you don't use inline event handlers in js.
[15:21:59] <noober03> nevermind i see you changed it to a console.log
[15:22:47] <noober03> robertmaxrees: how would i be able to get the file name from this upon upload?
[15:25:17] <JesusTheHun> hi ! is there a way to get the output of a loading page using ajax ? I mean I have a page which take a while to execute, and I would like to inform the visitor of the progression, so I made the page print "updateMessage(some info)", but of course jquery wait the page fully loaded to execute "success" function
[15:25:22] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tk7okgtr/2/ noober03
[15:25:46] <robertmaxrees> JesusTheHun there's a "beforesend"
[15:26:20] <noober03> cool thanks @robertmaxrees
[15:26:47] <robertmaxrees> JesusTheHun but otherwise you're kind of SOL if the page takes a while to download.
[15:26:53] <vivekananda> hey everyone
[15:27:19] <robertmaxrees> hey vivekananda
[15:27:22] <JesusTheHun> SOL ?
[15:27:29] <robertmaxrees> "shit outta luck"
[15:27:29] <vivekananda> asked this in js but seems delayed and its a js/jquery question but related to site dev. hope someone can point me to correct reading
[15:27:45] <vivekananda> I have login/registration working. The steps are 1. user enter data 2. use js ( using ajax POST) to confirm user and get user data. 3. Show logged in page with data. Keeping mobile friendliness in mind , which is a better approach for step 3.  a) get data in the ajax.success in the js and then from the same js call html elements and change them  b) get data in js and then POST to self page with new data ( this will use
[15:27:45] <vivekananda> php in the page to change) 3. anything else
[15:28:04] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda huyh?
[15:28:18] <robertmaxrees> that's a lot of text.  can you clarify what your question is?
[15:30:06] <noober03> I have a string = "this is a string \n new line needed", is there a way to interperet the newlines as newlines instead of just part of the string?
[15:30:36] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, :(. lemme try. choose between jquery ( post on self page with data) vs jquery ( just hide show divs with new data). Using this for google login.
[15:31:24] <robertmaxrees> you're really asking "should i just show/hide things or load them from my server"
[15:32:03] <robertmaxrees> to which i point out that if the stuff is just being shown/hidden, it's not really requiring a login.
[15:32:16] <robertmaxrees> so you should ship it from the server only if the user is authenticated.
[15:32:30] <JesusTheHun> robertmaxrees: I've tried this to see how it goes : https://gist.github.com/JesusTheHun/b94c97286adc916c17d8
[15:32:38] <JesusTheHun> but it doesnt go at all ^^
[15:32:50] <JesusTheHun> I see the first console log, and then, nothing
[15:33:10] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, okay lemme explain a little more. User is authenticated and the jquery callback has obtained user data. NOw, how do I display this data ? The choices come in here
[15:33:23] <robertmaxrees> by pushing that data into the page.
[15:33:34] <robertmaxrees> using templates, or reloading the page, or any number of techniques.
[15:34:07] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, yeah so my concern is , which approach helps with 1. speed 2 mobile friendly
[15:34:10] <vivekananda> in that order
[15:34:39] <vivekananda> would help if you gave me a little detailed workflow of how to do it
[15:34:40] <robertmaxrees> returning data via ajax, using templates, and rendering things out.
[15:34:46] <robertmaxrees> there's no detailed workflow...
[15:34:49] <robertmaxrees> it's that simple./
[15:35:48] <robertmaxrees> the "mobile-friendly" part is more about reduing network overhead and applying some sane CSS>
[15:36:16] <robertmaxrees> bootstrap can take care of the latter, the former would be best handled using ajax to ship the data you need and the client-side templating to update the page.
[15:36:39] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, the rendering part is a little confusing for me at the moment. I am on the index.php page and jquery is also here. I have the values in the jq call back. Now do I render a fresh index.php ? do I do a post on self ? do I post on temp.php and post back to index.php ?
[15:36:55] <robertmaxrees> you render client-side.
[15:37:05] <robertmaxrees> using all sorts of tools: underscore does templating.
[15:37:13] <robertmaxrees> there's also handlebars, moustache, etc.
[15:37:18] <robertmaxrees> you could build your own, even.
[15:37:30] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, if you just need to update a few small things on the page, just one-shot those changes.
[15:37:41] <robertmaxrees> or load a whole new page made for people who are logged in.
[15:38:32] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, would help if could get examples for rendering (will search ) . But more importantly should I do this without jquery. I want the site to load within a second and I see that more jq is causing slowing
[15:38:54] <robertmaxrees> then you're doing something inefficiently.
[15:39:02] <vivekananda> jq slows things right ?
[15:39:07] <robertmaxrees> jquery itself doesn't really introduce performance problems.
[15:39:12] <vivekananda> hmmm
[15:39:14] <robertmaxrees> unless you're not careful.
[15:39:31] <vivekananda> omyy that is a big if and quite diasporic
[15:39:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:40:44] <vivekananda> umm wrong word. I meant that is quite a blanket area to cover ( being careful I mean ) :(
[15:40:45] <robertmaxrees> what all are you doing when the user logs in?
[15:41:06] <uskerine> vivekananda, just in case it helps, I started by downloading a bootstrap template and implementing simple backend AJAX service to retrieve data
[15:41:07] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, I am simply following the google plus sign in on their site. I have the values in the callback
[15:41:21] <vivekananda> uskerine, I have bootstrap
[15:41:23] <uskerine> and for authenticate the user it is best to rely on HTTP server auth
[15:41:25] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda right, but what does any of this have to do with anything?
[15:42:38] <uskerine> vivekananda, by bootstrap template I am not refering to just bootstrap, but to those html templates based on bootstrap. you have lots of examples and IMHO is easy to follow the patterns and implement just the AJAX calls you need
[15:43:29] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, so after I get the user logged in and his info in the callback , now I have to show the 'logged in ' page to the user. I am trying to figure if I should just show hide particular divs or render a fresh new page . If the latter, what happens to the former. Do two pages exist with ssame names ?
[15:43:57] <robertmaxrees> new page i'd argue.
[15:43:58] <vivekananda> uskerine, any links you like ?
[15:44:03] <robertmaxrees> unless you drive it like an SPA.
[15:44:26] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, whats an spa?
[15:44:32] <robertmaxrees> single page application.
[15:44:43] <vivekananda> uskerine, any links to places / workflows/ tutorials that you remember ?
[15:44:49] <uskerine> http://startbootstrap.com/
[15:44:59] <uskerine> if you choose a tempalte you feel it might fit
[15:45:11] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, I am trying to make this mobile friendly too so single page would help right ?
[15:45:29] <uskerine> it will somehow force you to follow a pattern on how to implement your application
[15:45:41] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wct0vbca/ for an example of underscore templating.
[15:45:42] <uskerine> and I think it will make things easier, at least it did for me
[15:45:56] <robertmaxrees> and single page can help if done right.
[15:48:09] <vivekananda> I have more question about other jquery functions but will tackle one at a time. For now will look at the bootstrap thing
[15:48:19] <vivekananda> and the underscore templating
[15:48:29] <robertmaxrees> what other functions?
[15:50:07] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, other sections for the page but that is for later.
[15:50:16] <vivekananda> I am currently on this problem
[15:50:28] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:50:29] <robertmaxrees> ooookay
[15:50:33] <robertmaxrees> also: api.jquery.com
[15:50:41] <robertmaxrees> and learn.jquery.com - these are GREAT resources.
[15:50:52] <vivekananda> uskerine, that link is nice. The problem is I will have to change the whole page for implementing all that
[15:51:00] <uskerine> at the beginning jQuery and AJAX and when to do what is a bit overwhelming
[15:51:02] <vivekananda> would have to start from scratch
[15:51:11] <uskerine> specially those concepts on authentication
[15:51:27] <uskerine> be sure that you understand HTTP authentication, you can start with just that
[15:51:35] <vivekananda> uskerine, I already have the authentication and sessioning mostly :) . I am just trying to figure out the final rendering.
[15:51:41] <uskerine> your web server can handle the authentication of your users
[15:57:14] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, a naive question. you said I should render a new page. supposing I do what url does this page get ? I mean usually I either post or get a page which has a name and url but this page wont have any right ? or will it just retain the url the page just before it had ?
[15:57:52] <robertmaxrees> i'd use myurl.com/login
[15:58:12] <robertmaxrees> but this all really depends.
[15:58:59] <tasaif> vivekananda: are you using any kind of framework?
[15:59:03] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, I guess I will have to look at examples of how rendering is done using jquery. Does the process include a redirect or a url
[15:59:11] <vivekananda> tasaif, nope :(.
[15:59:15] <robertmaxrees> use a framework duder.
[15:59:26] <robertmaxrees> something like react or backbone.
[15:59:30] <robertmaxrees> or, hell, even angular.
[15:59:32] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, yeah. going to port this to drupal as soon as I get it working
[15:59:32] <robertmaxrees> just use something.
[15:59:36] <tasaif> what serverside language do you know?
[15:59:43] <vivekananda> mostly php
[15:59:44] <robertmaxrees> client-side framework mano.
[15:59:46] <robertmaxrees> not sure serverside
[16:00:14] <tasaif> have you used composer?
[16:00:22] <vivekananda> drupal would be fine right for framework requirements ?
[16:00:23] <robertmaxrees> *sure = just
[16:00:29] <vivekananda> for both sides right ?
[16:00:40] <robertmaxrees> drupal's a server-side framework i though
[16:01:07] <tasaif> looks like drupal is a cms
[16:01:27] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, yeah I guess. it is good for cms / cds / framework
[16:01:32] <vivekananda> hopefully would be okay
[16:01:37] <robertmaxrees> right, i'm familiar with it.
[16:01:40] <robertmaxrees> you need a client-side setup, too.
[16:01:52] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, I am using bootstrap
[16:01:54] <robertmaxrees> though depending on what you're making, drupal isn't the best choiuce probably.
[16:01:57] <vivekananda> but nothing like a full framework
[16:02:08] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, why is that ?
[16:02:23] <tasaif> https://packagist.org/packages/panique/php-login
[16:02:32] <robertmaxrees> if you want to do an SPA, you need a way to quickly and easily expose data in JSON.
[16:02:40] <robertmaxrees> not sure if drupal fits that bill.
[16:02:50] <robertmaxrees> basically you have an entire CMS but not actually use it.
[16:04:45] <vivekananda> tasaif, that is a very nice link. Though it won't help with scalability would it ? I don't want to start something and then have to redo the whole thing again for a bigger userbase ( if happens)
[16:06:49] <vivekananda> tasaif, they mention to use laravel or something for a more complicated system :(
[16:07:00] <vivekananda> and that is another learning curve isn't it
[16:07:05] <tasaif> laravel is a framework
[16:07:23] <vivekananda> tasaif, but so is the one you sent me ( panique )
[16:07:24] <tasaif> php-login is for logging in with php
[16:07:37] <tasaif> that's true, but it seems very minimal
[16:07:42] <vivekananda> ok
[16:07:59] <tasaif> are you familiar with mvc?
[16:08:56] <tasaif> panique I think is the name of the user, huge is the name of the package
[16:14:31] <vivekananda> tasaif, I am familiar with mvc yep. I used it during my java projects to create a couple of games ( checkers )
[16:14:45] <vivekananda> I haven't used it at all with ref to web dev though
[16:15:00] <robertmaxrees> you could also do an FRP project.
[16:15:12] <vivekananda> frp ?
[16:15:18] <tasaif> fibre reinforced plastic
[16:15:20] <robertmaxrees> functional reactive programming
[16:17:47] <vivekananda> uskerine, a question for you . Again naive. I liked one of the templates on that site. I don't however know how to use it. I mean I see that a live demo has things showing up . So what do I do after download esp with the sections on the left as -- charts , tables , forms etc ? I am guessing the demo itself isn't useful just shows how I can call functions from the libraries downloaded to create my own pages ?  but what if
[16:17:47] <vivekananda> I want to retain parts of the demo page? copy and paste ?  http://ironsummitmedia.github.io/startbootstrap-sb-admin-2/pages/index.html
[16:18:18] <pauled> Hi anyone on ipad/iPhone? want to try if autoplay on <audio> tag work?
[16:18:41] <robertmaxrees> don;'t use autoplay.
[16:18:55] <pauled> robertmaxrees: why? http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/pp92LLz6/
[16:19:09] <robertmaxrees> isn't it annoying when you visit a page and it starts making noise for no reason?
[16:19:56] <tasaif> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azl5jxcXCZk
[16:21:22] <pauled> robertmaxrees: it was a request from <jrkie> (but they left before). The code is not supposed to be publicly published. Can be used in a greasemonkey userscript
[16:22:25] <pauled> tasaif: haha I saw it in TV. love it
[16:23:36] <pauled> Web 1.0 from 90's with many gif and popup
[16:26:09] <tasaif> (^^)ｂ
[16:26:18] <robertmaxrees> pauled people still do that kind of stuff aaaaallll the time hahaha
[16:28:57] <pauled>  yeah I hate that kind of site. Thanks to nojs extension
[16:30:03] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:30:11] <pauled> ^^
[16:30:26] <robertmaxrees> i'll never understand why people willingly turn off JS still.
[16:30:54] <tasaif> you're being tracked
[16:30:58] <tasaif> your cookies will never be the same
[16:31:05] <robertmaxrees> oh noez
[16:31:14] <robertmaxrees> (i work in ecommerce, so I know aaaalll about tracking ;)
[16:31:16] <pauled> you don't understand, then I can give you a couple of site that will bloat your session
[16:31:25] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[16:31:36] <robertmaxrees> Yes, obviously i don't understand.  that MUST be the problem.
[16:31:47] <tasaif> I think the solution for a bloated session is to get a better computer
[16:32:06] <robertmaxrees> i think the solution is to not try to run 500 tabs at once.
[16:32:33] <tasaif> or visit… unsavory… sites
[16:32:40] <tasaif> because of all of the popups
[16:32:45] <pauled> I think the solution is to turn off the js by default and allow trusted site one by one
[16:33:02] <tasaif> that's a good point
[16:33:04] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:33:07] <robertmaxrees> uh okay
[16:33:41] <tasaif> and then you end up allowing js on all of the sites you visit
[16:33:57] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:34:19] <pauled> js is not necessary to just read a couple of texte
[16:34:21] <robertmaxrees> unless you're not rocking AV and a firewall (and you really should be), i can't see a good reason to not leave JS on.
[16:34:28] <pauled> some site abuse of JS
[16:34:42] <robertmaxrees> sure - don't go to those sites in the first place.
[16:35:12] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, for my earlier question about what happens if I echo html code as a new page . What will the new page url be ? will it be the same as the earlier page or will it change ?
[16:35:36] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda it should change and be setup so when the user visits that same url, they go to the same place.
[16:36:04] <vivekananda> umm didn't get your line.
[16:36:22] <robertmaxrees> if you're changing the page the user is on, you should update the URL accordingly.
[16:36:52] <robertmaxrees> however, don't forget the other side of that equation - if the user visits that same url directly, instead of browsing to it, the correct content should load.
[16:37:43] <pauled> robertmaxrees: what do you think about this site elementaryos-fr.org
[16:38:04] <pauled> robertmaxrees: please look it with dev tool
[16:38:24] <robertmaxrees> pauled why am i going to that site in the first place?
[16:38:26] <robertmaxrees> like, what is it?
[16:39:19] <pauled> no is not of course, but this site crashed my session because too many js
[16:39:32] <pauled> and is not the first one
[16:39:44] <robertmaxrees> not getting that at all.
[16:40:20] <robertmaxrees> not a well built site, but certainly not the worst i've seen.
[16:40:24] <pauled> ohh !! they changed his site
[16:41:38] <robertmaxrees> you sure it wasn't that your browser wasn't bugged?
[16:41:47] <robertmaxrees> or you weren't using a bad plugin or something?
[16:42:14] <pauled> hmm not sure if they changed the core of the site but the layout changed
[16:42:41] <pauled> but one thing not changed, is the number of js included
[16:42:52] <pauled> a lot
[16:42:52] <robertmaxrees> right.  who cares?
[16:43:11] <robertmaxrees> what browser are you running?  and is it up to date?
[16:43:11] <tasaif> clearly pauled cares, stop being mean
[16:43:15] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, my question / confusion is when 'rendering' using js or php I merely do an echo. Where do I change a url during doing that ?
[16:43:35] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[16:43:51] <robertmaxrees> you have to manage it yourself if you're going to dynamically load things.
[16:44:00] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you need actual separate pages on your server instead.
[16:45:31] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, if I have separate pages on the server then I will just be 'getting' that page rather than 'building' and then 'rendering' it right ?
[16:45:52] <robertmaxrees> instead of ajax, you would simply navigate like usual, correct.
[16:46:43] <vivekananda> building = building using templates with correct values. But if I build and the page is too big and complicated then :( . would be messy ! ( hence templates for parts I guess)
[16:46:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:46:56] <robertmaxrees> you don't use any templating at that point.
[16:47:00] <robertmaxrees> you can't do anything client side.
[16:47:03] <robertmaxrees> you're purely server-side.
[16:49:15] <vivekananda> hmm ok.  instead of navigating on the server side to the correct page , if I decide to build and render then the 'building' cannot happen on the client side ( as you said above). So supposing I built a new page on the server ( with templates) and now have to send this new page to client side ( to js ) to be rendered , how do I do that ? ( from inside js)
[16:50:30] <vivekananda> I can send a json containing all the html code but what do I do with the json on the js
[16:51:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:51:49] <robertmaxrees> you're really confused.
[16:52:09] <robertmaxrees> at that point, you might as well not do an SPA at all since there's no reason not to.
[16:52:40] <robertmaxrees> *there's no reason to do one i mean.
[16:56:26] <tasaif> http://mashable.com/2014/04/04/php-frameworks-build-applications/
[17:05:50] <combilombi> robertmaxrees: I believe I have finally identified the issue. By removing the wbr elements I am left with nodelists that have adjacent text nodes. When I subsequently set the html of the containing element to a version with a string wrapped in zalgo tags it has the effect of 'merging the text nodes' which means that the actual nodelist is now shorter than the one the script is iterating through, causing it to try to access a non
[17:06:33] <combilombi> As such I am able to solve this issue simply by making it reset the html of each element before I then have the second function go over it (using: $('.postContainer blockquote').each(function(i,v){ $(v).html($(v).html()); }); )
[17:07:14] <combilombi> Anyway, problem solved, just thought I should let you know.
[17:08:31] <pauled> robertmaxrees: 40 *.js for a web site that acts as a blog that seems a little excessive. http://i.imgur.com/HeiGsJL.png
[17:09:29] <robertmaxrees> combilombi that cut off for me, but glad you figured it out.
[17:09:44] <robertmaxrees> PaulCapestany meh.  some people do that.
[17:09:48] <robertmaxrees> doesn't really change my point earlier.
[17:09:58] <robertmaxrees> err, pauled
[17:10:37] <pauled> not counting unused css
[17:10:40] <combilombi> Did it? What's the max char length for posts then? I'm using the webclient if that makes a difference, but it has it's own max post length
[17:12:07] <robertmaxrees> combilombi "causing it to try to access a non"
[17:12:12] <robertmaxrees> that was the last part of the first one.
[17:12:19] <robertmaxrees> i can also impose my own length limit ;)
[17:18:25] <combilombi> robertmaxrees: Ah, it cut off "-existant node." then. That aside, is there a more appropriate way to wrap text in tags than doing setting the html of the parent element to the html.replace('string', 'tag wrapped string') that I'm using currently? I believe changing the nodeValue directly simply has the tags appear as text in the page
[17:19:01] <combilombi> (Whilst that wouldn't actually be an issue for the use-case I have in mind I'd rather know for future reference)
[17:23:19] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, yes I am confused about that particular point but did my question make any sense above ?
[17:23:37] <robertmaxrees> no because you're got the entire concept inside-out.
[17:23:51] <robertmaxrees> combilombi sorry i don't really remember your  issue at all.
[17:25:38] <combilombi> robertmaxrees: oh, it was ploughing through a webpage and wrapping zalgotext in <zalgo> tags so that an offline program could convert the downloaded page into a LaTeX document and handle zalgotext more easily.
[17:25:47] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[17:25:56] <combilombi> The issue was that it was breaking after removing the wbr elements for unapparent reasons
[17:26:15] <robertmaxrees> you want to .html($(whatever).html().replace()) probably.
[17:26:17] <robertmaxrees> something like that,
[17:26:41] <combilombi> Well, that's what I'm doing. I was just wondering if there was a more appropriate way, best practises etc
[17:27:29] <robertmaxrees> not invent tag names.  otherwise, you really don't have much of a choice.
[17:27:49] <robertmaxrees> well, even if you don't, injecting tags into strings is always a PITA - there's not "non-hacky" way to do it.
[17:28:06] <snover> “it was ploughing through a webpage and wrapping zalgotext in <zalgo> tags so that an offline program could convert the downloaded page into a LaTeX document and handle zalgotext more easily.” solving the important problems in #jquery tonight i see. :)
[17:28:12] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[17:29:01] <combilombi> Fair enough. Thinking about it, could one change the value of the node.nodeName to change what element it represents?
[17:29:16] <robertmaxrees> that's not really applicable in this case.
[17:29:24] <combilombi> snover: Oh, well, you know how it is... The trivial is always more fun
[17:29:50] <snover> you can split text nodes you know
[17:29:58] <snover> but not with jquery
[17:30:03] <robertmaxrees> that's another way.
[17:30:10] <robertmaxrees> but the entire thing is going to be kind of hacky imo.
[17:30:21] <combilombi> robertmaxrees: In terms of the element I want to change it to being an invalid one or simply not being able to change a node type that way?
[17:30:29] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, let me break down my question into what i know and what I don't. perhaps that would be better. From the client if I want to navigate to a page say a.php on server I just 'get' the page via ajax on js or simply href to it from html. This part I know. But if said a.php is not present on server persistantly but I rather create the contents of a.php on the server then do I create a fresh new file also with a
[17:30:29] <vivekananda> name a.php and paste the contents in them and then redirect to it or do I just send that html content to the client js and ask it to render
[17:30:51] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda too generic a question.
[17:30:54] <robertmaxrees> go read about SPAs.
[17:31:25] <robertmaxrees> and/or about templating.  server-side and client-side.
[17:31:26] <combilombi> snover: How would splitting the text nodes aid in wrapping the text in tags?
[17:31:27] <vivekananda> okay then tell me this. Are both doable ? esp is the latter doable ? if so how
[17:31:29] <robertmaxrees> that really sounds like what you need.
[17:31:33] <vivekananda> okay
[17:31:38] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda that's out of the scope of the channel.
[17:31:50] <vivekananda> hmmm okay. you are right
[17:31:51] <robertmaxrees> you're asking basic application architecture questions at this point.
[17:32:32] <vivekananda> although my question still is how to use jquery to 'render' or 'show' a page when it has the contents to the page in a variable
[17:32:38] <vivekananda> but yeah I guess should read
[17:33:21] <BuenGenio> Why is jQuery better than MooTools?
[17:34:15] <rcyr> BuenGenio: Community... a shitload of plugins
[17:34:19] <BuenGenio> Apart from the fact that MT is not publicly maintained
[17:34:30] <snover> combilombi: var zalgoNode = document.createElement('zalgo'); var nodeToReplace = node.splitText(startOffset); nodeToReplace.splitText(endOffset); nodeToReplace.parentNode.replaceChild(zalgoNode, nodeToReplace); zalgoNode.appendChild(nodeToReplace);
[17:35:00] <BuenGenio> rcyr, valid point about plugins, but how about semantics?
[17:35:16] <snover> BuenGenio: it’s not better. it’s different.
[17:35:47] <rcyr> BuenGenio: jQuery has some warts but is overall enjoyable to use.
[17:35:49] <BuenGenio> does anyone have any idea where JS is going in the next few years?
[17:36:13] <snover> i don’t think anyone has cracked time travel yet.
[17:36:28] <snover> combilombi: you could also use range api if the content you want to wrap is potentially mixed elements & text
[17:36:40] <robertmaxrees> BuenGenio i argue jquery is "better" isasmuch as i think most people grok the api a little quicker than mootools.
[17:36:47] <robertmaxrees> it also gets out of my way more and lets me gsd.
[17:37:08] <BuenGenio> i.e. Is there anything that MT or JQ still have to crack or invent in the context of modern browser apps?
[17:37:16] <rcyr> BuenGenio: My crystal ball sucks... but I wouldn't be surprised if there's a return to DOM in the future
[17:37:20] <snover> BuenGenio: why are you asking all of these questions
[17:37:52] <BuenGenio> robertmaxrees, valid argument, but I'm finding it harder to grok jQuery than MT  :)
[17:37:53] <snover> combilombi: var range = document.createRange(); range.setStart(startNode, startOffset); range.setEnd(endNode, endOffset); range.surroundContents(document.createElement('zalgo'));
[17:38:14] <BuenGenio> snover, because I can? :)
[17:38:17] <robertmaxrees> BuenGenio you're asking the wrong questions.
[17:38:21] <combilombi> snover: Ah, I see, thanks for the pointers.
[17:38:27] <rcyr> BuenGenio: So you dislike jQuery and try to rationalize that "hate"?
[17:38:44] <snover> glad to use my skills and experience for a worthwhile cause.
[17:38:48] <combilombi> Anyway, I've run out of problems so I'll bid you all thanks and farewell now
[17:38:49] <robertmaxrees> most people don't use jquery for modern browsers.  we use jquery because we need to support old/a wide variety of browsers.
[17:38:51] <BuenGenio> rcyr, I'm not here for a flamewar (though that'd be nice)
[17:39:02] <robertmaxrees> flamewars are not nice because they're incendiary.
[17:39:23] <robertmaxrees> after having used both MT and jq, we abated mt.
[17:39:24] <BuenGenio> robertmaxrees, who says "incendiary" is bad?
[17:39:25] <snover> i don’t know, robertmaxrees, when i’m paying attention they give me the opportunity to kick people
[17:39:28] <rcyr> There's no flamewar to have here.
[17:39:32] <snover> so it’s not all bad
[17:39:37] <robertmaxrees> snover :) eeexactly.
[17:39:46] <robertmaxrees> BuenGenio trolling isn't really tolerated here.
[17:39:51] <BuenGenio> meh
[17:39:56] <robertmaxrees> if you want to have a discussion, that's fine.
[17:39:57] <BuenGenio> who said trolling?
[17:40:06] <robertmaxrees> flamewars are a source of trolling.
[17:40:09] <BuenGenio> a discussion is all I'm after
[17:40:10] <snover> butts
[17:40:17] <robertmaxrees> and that's fine.
[17:40:18] <BuenGenio> I was jk about flamewars
[17:40:47] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[17:40:48] <snover> better doesn’t mean anything. tools are tools. does it make your job easier or harder? easier -> yay, use it. harder -> boo, stop using it.
[17:40:52] <BuenGenio> basically, I recognise the fact that jQ has won the community war
[17:41:18] <BuenGenio> but I'm not quite clear on where MT had started to lose it?
[17:41:18] <robertmaxrees> BuenGenio sure.  and jquery is great for those of us trying to accomplish things instead of fighting the DOM API differences.
[17:41:39] <BuenGenio> because functionalitywise jQ & MT are very similar
[17:41:42] <BuenGenio> right?
[17:41:45] <robertmaxrees> ish yeah.
[17:41:49] <snover> no
[17:41:55] <BuenGenio> why not?
[17:42:05] <robertmaxrees> MT had a slightly higher learning curve.  it also stomped all over global prototypes.
[17:42:49] <BuenGenio> robertmaxrees, global prototypes? how is MT.hide() different from jQ.hide() ?
[17:42:52] <BuenGenio> (element)
[17:42:56] <rcyr> BuenGenio: Might be sizzle that killed MT
[17:42:59] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:43:14] <robertmaxrees> they modified the string prototype, for instance
[17:43:26] <BuenGenio> how?
[17:43:35] <robertmaxrees> added some weird regex methods to them.
[17:43:38] <rcyr> Being able to select node by CSS selector was a huge improvement over anything else
[17:43:43] <robertmaxrees> rcyr++
[17:43:55] <robertmaxrees> that was a big one.  and not having to consider if it'll be a collection or a single element.
[17:44:00] <BuenGenio> I love Slick tbh
[17:44:10] <robertmaxrees> the MT $() vs $$() was always a pain imo.
[17:44:44] <BuenGenio> e.target.getParent('.menu-dropdown~>li') for exammple
[17:45:01] <BuenGenio> robertmaxrees, well, i've always been used to MT $ and $$ :)
[17:45:12] <robertmaxrees> BuenGenio right - how much experience do you have with jquery?
[17:45:24] <BuenGenio> and I have a lot of "one would say 'legacy'" code using $ and $$ which is based on MT
[17:45:31] <robertmaxrees> i did, too :)
[17:45:45] <BuenGenio> robertmaxrees, I'm open-minded but I'm finding it hard to jump the paradigm
[17:45:49] <BuenGenio> I use both
[17:46:01] <BuenGenio> but there are some things I really like about MT - e.g. Classes
[17:46:07] <BuenGenio> and Implements
[17:46:09] <BuenGenio> and Extends
[17:46:10] <robertmaxrees> i did an abatement of MT a few years ago in our applications and honestly, while i see some of MTs strengths, i think it got some things wrong.
[17:46:12] <robertmaxrees> like classes haha
[17:46:14] <BuenGenio> it's like OOP
[17:46:23] <robertmaxrees> *classical oop.
[17:46:30] <robertmaxrees> which imo has no place in javascript.
[17:46:42] <BuenGenio> lol that's just a POV, right? :)
[17:46:51] <BuenGenio> with all due respect
[17:46:52] <BuenGenio> :)
[17:46:53] <robertmaxrees> the language doesn't support traditional classes at all.
[17:46:55] <robertmaxrees> sooo...
[17:46:59] <robertmaxrees> why try to fake them?
[17:47:12] <robertmaxrees> people fight against the language instead of working with it and playing to its strengths
[17:47:23] <BuenGenio> it does support prototyping, which is way better than some OOPs
[17:47:25] <BuenGenio> no?
[17:47:38] <robertmaxrees> behavior delegation is neat, sure, and abused.
[17:48:20] <BuenGenio> robertmaxrees, it's not fighting against the language itself, it's about the approach. Extending natives vs. own classes
[17:48:28] <robertmaxrees> why?
[17:48:34] <robertmaxrees> why are those the only two options?
[17:48:41] <robertmaxrees> why not take a more functional approach?
[17:48:51] <rcyr> jQuery is more functional than OO
[17:49:22] <rcyr> jQuery is pretty much a monad :P (1+ point for using the M word)
[17:49:25] <BuenGenio> robertmaxrees, functional gets messy really quickly
[17:49:32] <BuenGenio> classy is neater
[17:49:32] <rcyr> BuenGenio: Opposite.
[17:49:37] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[17:49:43] <BuenGenio> no?
[17:49:53] <rcyr> BuenGenio: Don't confuse "functional" and procedural
[17:50:01] <BuenGenio> ah
[17:50:04] <rcyr> I mean... don't mix the two.
[17:50:05] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:50:21] <robertmaxrees> BuenGenio all my latest projects have been done with a more functional style and i regularly am told that my code is "beautiful" and "more readible"
[17:50:22] <rcyr> Procedural is crap (As far as I'm concerned)
[17:50:27] <robertmaxrees> yeah it is.
[17:50:33] <robertmaxrees> data flow is where it's at.
[17:50:53] <tasaif> masturbatory semantic arguments
[17:50:58] <tasaif> is where it's at
[17:51:06] <robertmaxrees> that was actually a legitimate correct, tasaif
[17:51:13] <robertmaxrees> *correction
[17:51:33] <BuenGenio> it's all about discipline no?
[17:51:45] <BuenGenio> a lot of jQ plugins use Element.hide()
[17:51:45] <robertmaxrees> BuenGenio in some ways.  and not reinventing the wheel.
[17:51:52] <robertmaxrees> $(element).hide()
[17:52:44] <BuenGenio> what if I don't want to apply .hide() to all Elements
[17:53:02] <robertmaxrees> .filter() the one you want.
[17:53:04] <BuenGenio> or what if I want to have different .hide()
[17:53:19] <BuenGenio> .filter() is weird
[17:53:22] <robertmaxrees> write a plugin or use .animate9) or whatever.
[17:53:31] <robertmaxrees> .filter() is great!  it's like the native filter.
[17:54:22] <TheDoudou> hi any one can help me plz
[17:54:35] <robertmaxrees> TheDoudou just ask your question if you have one.
[17:54:39] <BuenGenio> ok, so the biggest issue I've had with JQ, coming to realise it, is that anything returned by, say filter(), doesn't automatically have the extended functions
[17:54:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:55:04] <robertmaxrees> sure they do.
[17:55:04] <TheDoudou> robertmaxrees not simple question
[17:55:16] <BuenGenio> so say .filter('.class') just returns an element, not an element with all jQ functions
[17:55:23] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[17:55:25] <BuenGenio> no
[17:55:26] <BuenGenio> ?
[17:55:32] <tasaif> doesn't filter return a list of dom objects?
[17:55:36] <BuenGenio> yes
[17:55:39] <robertmaxrees> filter returns a jquery object.
[17:55:40] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[17:55:44] <BuenGenio> but they're just plain elements
[17:55:47] <tasaif> so?
[17:55:53] <robertmaxrees> they're jquery-fied elements.
[17:55:57] <BuenGenio> and also, what if I want to get an array of elements, and say addClass to them?
[17:56:14] <BuenGenio> in jQ you have to do $$('.array').each(function(...)))
[17:56:16] <robertmaxrees> then just .addClass() against the filter results
[17:56:18] <robertmaxrees> nope...
[17:56:26] <BuenGenio> in mt, you just $$('.els').addClass('active')
[17:56:50] <tasaif> #hatersgonnahate #didntdohw #gotoschool
[17:57:20] <BuenGenio> :)
[17:57:28] <TheDoudou> i use this https://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/ and this http://textextjs.com/ but when i put the textarea in the JS upload textarea not work (work fine out)
[17:57:29] <BuenGenio> ok, I might have been wrong there
[17:58:00] <deosama_> Does anyone know of a way i can get a user's location down to within 100 feet from their IP?
[17:58:03] <TheDoudou> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/index.html i put the textarea in bloc ligne 144
[17:58:26] <tasaif> deosama_: call the isp
[17:58:41] <deosama_> tasaif: hmm... seems a bit too slow
[17:59:00] <BuenGenio> ok, Ima read up on jQ
[17:59:01] <tasaif> no other choice
[17:59:24] <TheDoudou> robertmaxrees not simple
[17:59:57] <BuenGenio> but I think formerly I didn't used to be able to do something like this: jQuery('.form-control').removeClass('active')
[18:00:25] <BuenGenio> it'd have to be jQuery(jQuery('.form-control')[0]).removeClass('active')
[18:00:36] <rcyr> deosama_: I don't think it's possible to get that level of precision out of an ip
[18:00:41] <BuenGenio> I may be wrong though
[18:01:13] <TheDoudou> any one understand my problem ?
[18:01:26] <rcyr> BuenGenio: I'm don't want to be mean or anything... but it looks like you never seriously used jQuery
[18:01:31] <deosama_> rcyr: do you know of another way to do it? It can be within 500 feet for all I care (at the moment), but what I'm getting from my browser, and just a tracert is COMPLETELY wrong (not even the right city)
[18:02:03] <BuenGenio> rcyr, I would even agree with you. But jQ docs are a bit confusing
[18:02:07] <rcyr> deosama_: geoip lookups is pretty much the best you can get without GPS coordinates
[18:02:10] <robertmaxrees> BuenGenio huh?
[18:02:13] <robertmaxrees> they're really clear.
[18:02:22] <BuenGenio> ok, hold on
[18:02:26] <BuenGenio> looking up
[18:02:57] <robertmaxrees> notice where it says "returns" in the upper right of stuff?
[18:02:59] <BuenGenio> so you go to http://api.jquery.com/
[18:03:11] <robertmaxrees> rarely, but sure.
[18:03:31] <BuenGenio> and it expands "Deprecated"  for some reason
[18:03:37] <deosama_> rcyr: you're basically talking about this... right: http://www.w3schools.com/htmL/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_geolocation
[18:03:45] <robertmaxrees> all submenus are fully expanded, BuenGenio
[18:04:14] <rcyr> deosama_: No, that's browser geolocation... if you can get the users to accept the prompt, it's the most precise measurement you can get.
[18:04:36] <rcyr> deosama_: geoip lookups are server-side
[18:04:37] <robertmaxrees> also: lol w3schools
[18:04:41] <deosama_> rcyr: gah, that's even MILES away from my real location...
[18:05:01] <deosama_> robertmaxrees: hey man, what's wrong with w3schools? They have some good stuff on there.
[18:05:01] <BuenGenio> ok http://api.jquery.com/category/events/browser-events/
[18:05:08] <BuenGenio> only 3 events???
[18:05:15] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:05:24] <rcyr> BuenGenio: jQuery supports all the events via the .on method
[18:05:32] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[18:05:51] <TheDoudou> i think i know where my problem but I do not see how to solve it
[18:06:09] <BuenGenio> ok, maybe I'm just biased
[18:06:18] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, use .on() - you can bind to any event with that.
[18:06:40] <BuenGenio> it's like - I'm good with languages, but I don't want to learn chinese, because I think it's ugly...
[18:06:47] <robertmaxrees> you'll see if most (if not all) of the event bindings that they're actually shortcuts to .on()
[18:06:57] <robertmaxrees> you're just getting used to jq.  it's all good :)
[18:07:19] <BuenGenio> so .on is like .addEvent() in MT?
[18:07:31] <robertmaxrees> iirc, yeah - http://api.jquery.com/on/
[18:08:17] <robertmaxrees> yeah, very similar concept.
[18:08:30] <robertmaxrees> .on() supports doing delegated listeners out of the box pretty easily, too.
[18:09:15] <BuenGenio> robertmaxrees, well MT supports delegation via addEvent('click:element', function()} too....
[18:10:20] <BuenGenio> ok, so what's there in jQ that I can use as a Class, as it were, without affecting other elements?
[18:10:47] <BuenGenio> e.g. some Forms I want to exhibit specific functionality, while others I don'
[18:10:48] <BuenGenio> t
[18:10:59] <BuenGenio> class-based?
[18:12:55] <tasaif> $('form.class-name').on(function(){do stuff})
[18:13:46] <tasaif> sorry
[18:14:14] <tasaif> $('form.class-name').on(event, function(ev){do stuff})
[18:14:25] <robertmaxrees> "some forms"
[18:14:33] <robertmaxrees> how are you differentiating those forms?
[18:15:05] <tasaif> (presumably with classes)
[18:16:16] <robertmaxrees> yeah i'd need to see an example.
[18:16:23] <robertmaxrees> but you could just do $('.class-name').on9"
[18:16:31] <robertmaxrees> *.on('submit', function() {});
[18:16:48] <robertmaxrees> if you're sharing that class, you can include the tagname in the selector, though that's derty.
[18:16:52] <BuenGenio> yeah, as in that I can apply a class to specific elements, rather than extendng every element's prototype with a class that I only need to use once...
[18:17:08] <TheDoudou> robertmaxrees trying after
[18:17:09] <robertmaxrees> you're not extending any element's prototype btw.
[18:17:21] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't extend built-in prototypes.
[18:17:45] <robertmaxrees> and if you mean soemthing like "apply .on() to specific elements", you can do that all sorts of ways.
[18:17:47] <robertmaxrees> classes, filter, etc.
[18:18:10] <BuenGenio> well, how do you explain jQuery('#datetime').datepicker({..}) ?
[18:18:22] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[18:18:31] <robertmaxrees> that writes in a bunch of html and binds an event listener to some things.
[18:18:32] <BuenGenio> for all I know I could do jQuery('input').datepicker
[18:18:44] <BuenGenio> every element in jQuery is extended
[18:18:47] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:18:52] <robertmaxrees> that's not how that works.
[18:18:53] <BuenGenio> with date picker for example
[18:19:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you're really confused about what jquery is doing under the hood.
[18:19:14] <BuenGenio> perhaps
[18:19:15] <tasaif> datepicker is a plugin
[18:19:23] <BuenGenio> yeah
[18:19:24] <BuenGenio> it is
[18:19:31] <tasaif> you can write a plugin if you want, but you generally don't need to
[18:19:34] <robertmaxrees> it writes html to the page and binds some event listeners.
[18:20:02] <tasaif> and gives you the $().blegh
[18:20:17] <robertmaxrees> $('input').datepicker() would try to run that function on each input element on the page.
[18:20:25] <uskerine> if I define a javascript object in "foo.js", can I reference later in "bar.js" ? $.getScript( "foo.js"); $.getScript("bar.js");
[18:20:55] <robertmaxrees> uskerine if the object is defined in the global scope, yes.
[18:21:08] <uskerine> I am defining a datatables object in foo.js and there is a function in bar.js where I would like to reuse that datatables to force a refresh
[18:21:34] <uskerine> if object is defined under $(document).ready(function(){ .... } ) does that apply?
[18:21:43] <robertmaxrees> that's not in the global scope.
[18:21:57] <robertmaxrees> if it's defined in a function, it's scoped to that function.  you can't access it outside of that function.
[18:22:33] <uskerine> I see
[18:24:01] <uskerine> I guess that while using .load,  there is no need to include the jQuery foo related stuff in "$(document).ready" function, right?   $('#mainContent').load('html/foo.html', function() { $.getScript( "js/foo.js"); } )
[18:24:38] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:24:55] <TheDoudou> my problem if with i put http://textextjs.com/manual/examples/tags.html this in this bloc https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/index.html#L144 the field is normal it does not receive the tag script
[18:25:26] <TheDoudou> (outside this bloc template it's ok)
[18:25:42] <uskerine> I am loading http dynamically via the .load method
[18:25:57] <uskerine> but I also load jQuery related stuff to that html code
[18:25:58] <robertmaxrees> TheDoudou huh? can you make a fiddle?
[18:26:18] <robertmaxrees> uskerine that's a bad idea
[18:26:20] <robertmaxrees> don't re-load jquery.
[18:26:27] <TheDoudou> fiddle ?
[18:26:37] <TheDoudou> not understand sorry (speak french)
[18:26:44] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/
[18:26:49] <robertmaxrees> set up an example here.
[18:27:07] <TheDoudou> ho oki ^^
[18:27:15] <TheDoudou> wait
[18:27:32] <uskerine> robertmaxrees, what would you suggest then?
[18:27:47] <robertmaxrees> not loading entire pages like that.
[18:27:49] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i go.
[18:28:42] <uskerine> uhm
[18:35:19] <BuenGenio> yeah, what is $. ?
[18:36:02] <BuenGenio> also, why did everyone go for the  $ selector ? :)
[18:36:14] <BuenGenio> including MT...
[18:42:40] <TheDoudou> i can make in jsfiddle it's too big lol
[18:48:27] <TheDoudou> why if with i put http://textextjs.com/manual/examples/tags.html this (teaxarea field) in this bloc template https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/index.html#L144 the field is normal it does not receive the first script
[19:59:04] <TheDoudou> it's ok
[20:22:10] <checkit> Hey guys... I'm having trouble chaining $("<a />").data("test", "true"); http://jsfiddle.net/v4xk9z25/
[20:37:06] <checkit> Hey guys... I'm having trouble chaining $("<a />").data("test", "true"); http://jsfiddle.net/v4xk9z25/
[20:38:40] <BillCriswell> checkit: What are you expecting?
[20:39:25] <checkit> <a href="bla" id="bla" data-test="true">Hello World</a>
[20:39:59] <BillCriswell> There's no <a> in the fiddle you posted..
[20:41:39] <checkit> $("<a />").attr("#").data("test", "true").text("Hello")
[20:42:02] <BillCriswell> .attr('#') means nothing
[20:42:18] <BillCriswell> You'd need to do like .attr('href', '#')
[20:42:19] <checkit> that was a bad paste... attr("id", blabla....
[20:42:26] <BillCriswell> or better yet .prop()
[20:42:39] <checkit> Oh right. Forgot about prop...
[20:42:55] <checkit> Should I just append "data" via prop as well?
[20:43:25] <BillCriswell> no, you should use data
[20:44:49] <BillCriswell> checkit: http://jsfiddle.net/v4xk9z25/1/ like this
[20:44:50] <BillCriswell> ?
[20:52:39] <checkit> BillCriswell: Oh. Sweet! Thank you.
[20:55:28] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[20:57:12] <checkit> BillCriswell: What about something like this. Trying to blend your solution into the application snippet. http://jsfiddle.net/v4xk9z25/2/
[20:59:29] <BillCriswell> It works but I find it hard to read.
[21:22:57] <checkit> BillCriswell: Sorry... Had to take the dog out. Anyway, I also find it hard to read but for the purpose of the example. And it's not working as far as I can see.
[21:47:38] <TheDoudou> ok work fine :D
[22:29:15] <dimi1947> I am ussing append() to insert content to the DOM...the problem is that append,each time is called inserts the same content repeadetly...I want an overwite of content....should I use another method...better for this?
[23:06:34] <phelix> I have a selector... ul.sf-menu > li > a > ul > li > a.active so when it finds that a.active I need to add a class to ul.sf-menu > li --> The first parent li.. how would i go about doing that?
[23:08:10] <phelix> can you do like parent('li').parent('li') ?
[23:19:15] <needshelp> Can I prevent `.css()` from adding `px` to a specific value? Maybe based on the CSS property I'm setting?
[23:19:35] <arthurvr> !api jQuery.cssNumber @ needshelp
