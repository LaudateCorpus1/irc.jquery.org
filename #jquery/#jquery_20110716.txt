[00:30:04] <grandy> hello, does anyone know where i'd find docs about something like this:  $(document).bind({"post:/hello", function(e, o){}})
[00:33:25] <grandy> does anyone know if its' a call back after the post resturns or if it's called at the momemnt the post first occurs?
[00:38:50] <r500> http://pastebin.com/xWvzJniv any help on  this?? i want to get values from dropdown

[00:53:15] <versatiletech> r500: post your code on jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net
[00:56:29] <DannyZB> remember how I nagged you about all sorts of noob jQuery nonsense?
[00:56:59] <versatiletech> ??

[00:58:12] <r500> versatiletech: sorry this one   http://jsfiddle.net/QGyH6/16/
[00:58:17] <versatiletech> r500: what is it that you want to do?
[00:59:05] <DannyZB>  alert(selectedAItems); -> this isn't gonna work
[00:59:45] <r500> i want to get selected values from all those three list box  in a variable seperated by commas; as it does for checkboxes
[00:59:50] <r500> versatiletech:
[01:00:23] <DannyZB> r500 : are you familiar with the javascript function split?
[01:00:34] <DannyZB> or join *
[01:01:15] <r500> DannyZB:  The min thing is that i am not able to  retrieve selected value  of those three listboxes
[01:01:19] <r500> main*
[01:01:23] <DannyZB> array.join(separator) -> as in selectedAItems.join(',')
[01:01:26] <DannyZB> oh
[01:01:29] <DannyZB> one sec
[01:01:55] <DannyZB> whats the problem?
[01:02:12] <DannyZB> $("#some_checkbox").val() returns "on" or "off"
[01:02:46] <DannyZB> input[name='abc[]']:selected -> this I didn't get .. why are you only selecting checked ones?
[01:03:10] <r500> DannyZB:  the code works for checkboxes;  it alerts the value d selected checkboxes; but the same thing doesnt work with ropdowns
[01:03:55] <r500> input[name='abc[]']:selected  == with that i wanted to get selected value from dropdown array
[01:04:02] <r500> DannyZB:
[01:04:31] <r500> correct me plz, m not that familiar with jquery
[01:05:06] <DannyZB> ok 1 sec
[01:05:17] <harshada_> hey m making ajax call on form submit.. when i put breakpoint its execute fine.. but other time not giving proper output.. any idea?
[01:07:03] <r500> DannyZB:  ok
[01:10:04] <versatiletech> r500: do you have firebug installed?
[01:10:21] <r500> versatiletech:  yup
[01:10:26] <versatiletech> http://jsfiddle.net/b4CCH/
[01:10:32] <versatiletech> open up the console
[01:10:43] <versatiletech> click on the test_dropdown button
[01:10:56] <r500> ok
[01:11:21] <r500> versatiletech:  and?
[01:11:26] <r500> nothing happened
[01:11:54] <versatiletech> r500: should say something in your console
[01:12:09] <versatiletech> selects [option, option, option]
[01:13:24] <r500> versatiletech:  error lst os not define
[01:13:25] <r500> d
[01:13:37] <versatiletech> and before that?
[01:13:40] <r500> oops sorry

[01:14:36] <DannyZB> 4500
[01:14:38] <DannyZB> r500*
[01:14:39] <DannyZB> works now
[01:14:52] <r500> versatiletech:  ya it gives tat
[01:15:05] <versatiletech> now check everything
[01:15:08] <DannyZB> you don't treat a select as a checkbox
[01:15:10] <DannyZB> *
[01:15:21] <DannyZB> you get the val of the -select- -> not it's items
[01:15:33] <versatiletech> I mean check the checkboxes and choose different values
[01:15:59] <r500> DannyZB:  ok ill try
[01:16:08] <DannyZB> I already did it
[01:16:35] <r500> DannyZB:  thats COOL :D
[01:16:39] <r500> ya u did
[01:16:42] <r500> thanks :)
[01:16:57] <DannyZB> I also fixed the checkboxes
[01:17:01] <DannyZB> it's :checked not :selected
[01:17:03] <DannyZB> no prob
[01:18:48] <r500> DannyZB: oops.. ya its checked.. while  playing with dropdowns i made the mistake .. u saved my head :p
[01:20:00] <RobertV> say i have two divs, #foo1 and #foo2, and i bind() keypress to #foo1. how does jquery determine which DIV gets the keypress? is there some kind of focus model in the DOM?
[01:22:53] <RobertV> i guess it only makes sense for focusable elements
[01:23:07] <DannyZB> makes sense .. test it
[01:23:40] <RobertV> that's the point, how would you test it
[01:23:58] <RobertV> divs don't recieve selection focus
[01:24:05] <DannyZB> make 2 divs .. one makes an alert ("div 1") the second ("div 2")
[01:24:07] <DannyZB> yes they do
[01:24:13] <DannyZB> you need to set their focus index
[01:24:14] <DannyZB> 1 sec
[01:26:40] <DannyZB> you need to set the tabindex property
[01:26:46] <DannyZB> once you set it a div is focusable
[01:26:51] <DannyZB> I use it extensively in my app
[01:27:07] <DannyZB> ie <div tabindex="100"></div>
[01:27:22] <RobertV> cool. never heard of it before
[01:27:42] <RobertV> was just checking out .focus()
[01:29:05] <DannyZB> maybe you guys can help me out .. where can I find people who like using new software? ie I'm putting my app in initial beta and I need several dozen users
[01:29:38] <RobertV> what market?
[01:31:27] <DannyZB> It's file storage / sharing through facebook
[01:31:31] <DannyZB> the regular user
[01:31:48] <DannyZB> I use jquery to make most common file types work through the app directly
[01:41:03] <innociv> http://pastebin.com/mFcW453m I'm getting this error in my code.  It's an apple webkit thing, not my code.. I don't get how I'm supposed to discern anything from this. It's giving me "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL"
[01:41:48] <DannyZB> it is your code ..
[01:41:57] <DannyZB> it means you have an error in your javascript syntax
[01:42:21] <nir0> guys is there any way to fadeOut with element stays on the page invisible, keeping reserved space for it
[01:43:23] <DannyZB> one sec where is this code from anyway?
[01:43:44] <DannyZB> where does webkit have php anyway ><
[01:43:47] <nir0> so it will fadeOut, everything after element will not go higher (in my case i got a vertical list)
[01:44:09] <DannyZB> yes
[01:44:35] <nir0> danny
[01:44:42] <nir0> who are u talkin to?
[01:44:48] <DannyZB> you
[01:44:48] <innociv> I bet I do, but where? ;/
[01:45:06] <innociv> Bad error.  Bah
[01:45:10] <DannyZB> when using fadeOut it eventually sets css "display:none" , and what you need is "visibility:hidden"
[01:45:23] <DannyZB> one sec I'll check if theres a jquery function for that
[01:46:16] <DannyZB> anyway you can always use $("#element").css("visibility","hidden");
[01:46:25] <nir0> with animation
[01:46:29] <nir0> right?
[01:46:38] <DannyZB> found it
[01:46:39] <DannyZB> yes
[01:46:46] <DannyZB> $("#element").animate({opacity:0})
[01:47:44] <nir0> duration?
[01:48:25] <DannyZB> or even better $("#element").animate({opacity:0},duration,"linear",function(){$(this).css("visibility","none");});
[01:49:26] <DannyZB> please note that invisible items that have flash in them still accept mouse clicks in it
[01:50:27] <nir0> sure, i'm trying to implement blinking of admin menu item, so manager will  see that new message need a review
[01:50:56] <DannyZB> oh so no prob
[01:52:41] <nir0> if (obj.css("opacity") == "0") {obj.animate({opacity:100})}else {obj.animate({opacity:0})} provides strange effect though: it fades out, but after that just sets opacity back to 100
[01:52:54] <innociv> == 0 not == "0"
[01:53:05] <innociv> and I think it's 1.0 not 100
[01:53:15] <DannyZB> yea
[01:53:18] <DannyZB> 1.0
[01:53:24] <Double_Rainbow> hello
[01:53:30] <Chib> hello
[01:53:36] <DannyZB> and I don't think javascript should have a problem with "0"
[01:53:37] <Double_Rainbow> i want to display a progress bar that never ends
[01:53:44] <nir0> thanks, 1.0 fixed that
[01:53:51] <DannyZB> what do you mean by never ends?
[01:54:08] <nir0> "0" and 0 both works
[01:54:11] <DannyZB> where is the loop in that anyway?
[01:54:11] <Double_Rainbow> i just goes on continually, until the whole 110 mb download ensd
[01:54:25] <DannyZB> and why don't you use a final function to wait for the first effect to finish?
[01:54:41] <DannyZB> jquery is multi-threaded ... one effect doesn't wait for the previous to finish
[01:54:44] <Double_Rainbow> please just give me the progress bar
[01:55:00] <DannyZB> so just use an animation you don't need javascript ...
[01:55:02] <Chib> woah!
[01:55:18] <Chib> just give it to him damn you man!
[01:55:47] <Double_Rainbow> i am using Sencha, and it needs to download a huge number of css / js files before it does anything important on the screen. So i need a progres bar to tell the user to calm down
[01:55:55] <DannyZB> don't swear kid :) nir0 -> I'll send it to you in a sec
[01:55:57] <Double_Rainbow> now where can i find a jquery one
[01:56:21] <DannyZB> double_rainbow ->http://www.ajaxload.info/
[01:56:29] <DannyZB> get a gif animation there .. it's simpler
[01:56:43] <Double_Rainbow> DannyZB: hmm, never thought of that
[01:57:03] <y2gay> can anyone tell why this slider http://version-x.coalatreecom.tnfn.stackablehost.com/ has those margins between the images, when it uses the same code as this slider http://coalatree.com

[02:02:26] <grandy> hello, anyone ever seen this before:  $(document).bind({"post:/hello", function(e, o){}})
[02:02:56] <grandy> anyone know if it's a "before" trigger on the post or if it's a callback?
[02:04:00] <nir0> DannyZB: says something about missing )
[02:04:24] <grandy> DannyZB: ?
[02:06:19] <nir0> DannyZB: nvm u just mistyped functiom function
[02:11:54] <grandy> DannyZB: ahh ok do you know the answer to my question by any chance
[02:11:54] <grandy> ?
[02:11:57] <sorush20> hi this doens't make sense to me
[02:11:59] <sorush20> $('.menu li:has(ul)', this).hover{function() {.css(visibilty:visible;)});
[02:12:10] <sorush20> am I making mistake here?
[02:13:40] <DannyZB> grandy : nevery seen anything like that in my life
[02:13:45] <DannyZB> never*
[02:14:07] <grandy> DannyZB: you're lucky :)
[02:14:17] <DannyZB> probably lol
[02:14:23] <DannyZB> $('.menu li:has(ul)', this).hover{function() {$(this).css(visibilty:visible;)});
[02:14:27] <DannyZB> to sorush20
[02:15:14] <DannyZB> $('.menu li:has(ul)', this).hover{function() {$(this).css("visibility","visible);});
[02:15:17] <DannyZB> fix*
[02:15:36] <DannyZB> whats "this" anyway?
[02:17:15] <nir0> DannyZB: one more question
[02:17:32] <DannyZB> ?
[02:17:41] <nir0> DannyZB: how do i make that keep blinkin more than once
[02:20:53] <EDK> i am having an error on it..
[02:20:54] <EDK> Firebug's log limit has been reached. 0 entries not shown.		Preferences	
[02:20:54] <EDK> $("#carousel").jcarousel is not a function
[02:20:54] <EDK> [Break On This Error] initCallback: mycarousel_initCallback
[02:21:12] <sorush20> DannyZB: thanks,, didn't work but its my mistake..
[02:21:13] <EDK> but this function exist...
[02:21:49] <sorush20> this is the full code
[02:21:50] <sorush20> $(document).ready(function(){ $('.menu li:has(ul)', this).hover{function() {$(this).css("visibility","visible");});});});
[02:22:05] <pr0ton> in javascript, if i'm writing a call
[02:22:06] <pr0ton> **class
[02:22:12] <pr0ton> how do i call other public functions?
[02:22:30] <pr0ton> normally, you'd define a function like  this.pubfun = function() { ... }
[02:24:53] <DannyZB> nir0:
[02:25:04] <nir0> y
[02:25:14] <DannyZB> let me think about it for a sec heh
[02:25:27] <DannyZB> hmm how about recursion?
[02:25:51] <DannyZB> you know how to use recursion right?
[02:27:50] <DannyZB> nir0: the simplest way is just putting a callback for another blink inside the callback
[02:27:56] <DannyZB> it's ugly but it's simpler and works
[02:28:58] <DannyZB> the other solution is creating a function blink(object) that when it fades in / out it calls itself again and passes (i-1) until it gets i=0 ( with i being the number of blinks * 2 )
[02:29:12] <DannyZB> blink (object, i ) *
[02:29:45] <RikudoSennin> is there a plugin to switch between table cells via drag-drop?
[02:30:41] <DannyZB> RikudoSennin: wild guess > try $("tr","#sometable").sortable();
[02:30:48] <DannyZB> it requires jQuery UI though
[02:31:07] <RikudoSennin> DannyZB: not necessarily from the same row/column.
[02:31:26] <RikudoSennin> cell 1,2 can be switched with cell 5,3
[02:35:24] <DannyZB> Ihttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/82259/html-drag-and-drop-sortable-tables
[02:35:40] <DannyZB> RikudoSennin:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/82259/html-drag-and-drop-sortable-tables see if you can find an answer there
[02:39:55] <RikudoSennin> http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#display-grid
[02:40:15] <RikudoSennin> this one is ALMOST what I want, but I want to drag it onto another cell and that they'll swap placeses
[02:40:19] <RikudoSennin> places*
[02:40:24] <DannyZB> thats what it does
[02:40:27] <DannyZB> it's not a table though
[02:41:06] <DannyZB> if you want a "swapping" effect you can use a placeholder class
[02:41:41] <pr0ton> is there something i need to know about the dialog?
[02:41:56] <RikudoSennin> DannyZB: no, it doesn't swap between the cells, it sorts them
[02:42:03] <pr0ton> i mean, why doesnt this work $('<div ..> <div /> <div /> </div>').dialog( ... );
[02:42:04] <RikudoSennin> it inserts "1" between "3" and "4"
[02:42:09] <pr0ton> i mean, two divs inside a dig
[02:42:11] <pr0ton> **div
[02:42:13] <RikudoSennin> while I want "1" to replace "3"
[02:42:15] <pr0ton> but i'm writing from scratch
[02:42:41] <DannyZB> oh .. I dunno
[02:43:27] <RikudoSennin> pr0ton: what are you trying t odo?
[02:43:42] <RikudoSennin> a dialog can't operate on 2 elements
[02:43:44] <RikudoSennin> it requires one
[02:43:50] <RikudoSennin> give one an ID and use it.
[02:44:07] <RikudoSennin> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/ << see here
[02:44:09] <pr0ton> i need to insert some HTML markup
[02:44:16] <RikudoSennin> then use .append
[02:44:26] <pr0ton> RikudoSennin, ok
[02:44:48] <pr0ton> append to what?
[02:44:49] <DannyZB> RikudoSennin : you can probably do it with a drop callback , too tired to think of the specifics at the moment
[02:44:56] <sorush20> I have a problem with brakets and curly brackets
[02:45:07] <RikudoSennin> $('body').append('<div id="wrapper" />); $("#wrapper").append('<div id="dialog" />');
[02:45:31] <DannyZB> you use $("td","#droptable").droppable({ondrop:function(){//swapplaces}});
[02:45:34] <RikudoSennin> sorush20: don't worry, they have a problem with you too
[02:45:43] <pr0ton> lol
[02:45:48] <DannyZB> heh
[02:46:14] <DannyZB> drop:function *
[02:46:26] <sorush20> what would be the best way to learn jquery
[02:46:41] <djQuery> ?101@sorush
[02:46:41] <bot-t> sorush, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[02:46:50] <djQuery> ?jqf@sorush
[02:46:50] <bot-t> sorush, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[02:47:13] <djQuery> sorush20: if you dont know javascript start with the first one
[02:47:21] <DannyZB> RikudoSennin -> now I recall I already did something like that ... you make every table cell a droppable and a draggable
[02:47:33] <DannyZB> \then in the drop callback you clone each of them in place of the other
[02:48:02] <djQuery> ?draggable
[02:48:03] <bot-t> djQuery, UI/Draggables/draggable - http://docs.jquery.com/UI/draggable
[02:48:06] <RikudoSennin> look
[02:48:12] <djQuery> ?ui.draggable
[02:48:12] <bot-t> The jQuery UI Draggable plugin makes selected elements draggable by mouse. http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/
[02:48:17] <RikudoSennin> what I'm doing is a schedule application
[02:48:27] <RikudoSennin> the app fits people into appointments
[02:48:32] <RikudoSennin> and then displays the final result
[02:48:51] <RikudoSennin> if the human operator isn't happy with the results, he can simply drag/drop and swap between dates and times
[02:49:07] <DannyZB> RikudoSennin: I just gave you the answer
[02:49:08] <RikudoSennin> it should also submit autmatically to a database, but let's put that aside for the moment
[02:49:31] <RikudoSennin> can you elaborate on then in the drop callback you clone each of them in place of the other?
[02:49:44] <sorush20> is it okay to talk about possible costs? what would a jquery developer who was also able to use java script well charge perhour , the upper and lower end?
[02:49:47] <RikudoSennin> how do I know its place?
[02:49:53] <DannyZB> $("td","#schedule").droppable({drop:function(){/* swap places */}).draggable();
[02:50:09] <RikudoSennin> sorush20: depends on what you are doing and to what extent
[02:50:11] <DannyZB> the drop function accepts a variable that points to the object being dropped
[02:50:21] <DannyZB> and the object being dragged is very simply $(this)
[02:50:39] <DannyZB> then do your thing .. clone both of them in place of the other and delete the original
[02:50:51] <sorush20> RikudoSennin: so the hourly rate is variable according to the project...
[02:51:09] <DannyZB> you also have all the data you need to make an ajax call -> you can revert everything if the ajax calls produces an error
[02:51:09] <RikudoSennin> I understand the theory, can you make a quick example DannyZB ?
[02:51:18] <DannyZB> hmm in a sec
[02:51:33] <RikudoSennin> sorush20: well, if you are making a gigantic project or an applet for a small page, there is a difference yes.
[02:52:14] <sorush20> RikudoSennin: doctors charge a rate lawery a rate , I just thought developers would too..
[02:52:34] <RikudoSennin> sorush20: it's really up to you
[02:52:41] <schu> hi there. i am looking for a image flip plugin (like http://www.frontlineshop.com/Brands/Diesel/Products.html?onc=BRANDS) - can anyone point me in the right direction?
[02:53:08] <RikudoSennin> it also depends on factors like "do you want it to work on ALL browsers?" "do you want maximum efficiency if your page is watched often" etc
[02:53:19] <sorush20> is there anywhere I can post my project and get quotes.. anyone know ?
[02:53:58] <sorush20> http://freelanceauctions.com/index.html
[02:54:07] <sorush20> would anyone recommend this?
[02:54:21] <RikudoSennin> schu: there are tons of those
[02:54:30] <RikudoSennin> what did these guys use?
[02:55:02] <DannyZB> RikudoSennin : http://pastebin.com/dTaQ5jJb
[02:55:07] <schu> RikudoSennin: i know there are lots of different image flip, gallery or lightbox scripts but i need exactly that functionality which builds (as far as i could find out) on prototype
[02:55:15] <DannyZB> it's a basic example , you add the effects you want
[02:55:42] <DannyZB> in my example I used a class for table cells , you can just do the $("td","#thetable") thing
[02:57:50] <DannyZB> btw, to prevent weird twitches of the screen you can hide the cloned objects until the originals are removed
[02:59:51] <RikudoSennin> DannyZB: http://jsfiddle.net/G4f3H/
[02:59:54] <RikudoSennin> doesn't seem to work
[03:00:38] <DannyZB> draggable-cell -> where do you see anything of that class?
[03:00:41] <DannyZB> one sec I'll fix it
[03:01:10] <RikudoSennin> my badd
[03:01:11] <RikudoSennin> http://jsfiddle.net/G4f3H/2/
[03:01:19] <RikudoSennin> here, works but faulty
[03:01:43] <DannyZB> O
[03:01:50] <DannyZB> I'm looking at it
[03:03:52] <RikudoSennin> also, it seems like cells that have been swapped can't be reswapped
[03:04:06] <KingDosser> I am having a problem with manipulating an element loaded using AJAX. I am adding html to an element then trying to resize that element. I do a console.log of the html before I call the resize function and it has the correct html but it wont reset it.
[03:04:38] <RikudoSennin> KingDosser: I don't understand your problem
[03:04:46] <RikudoSennin> can you jsfiddle it?
[03:05:15] <RikudoSennin> or at least paste it?
[03:05:25] <DannyZB> RikudoSennin: I think there is no clean solution for this ><
[03:05:34] <DannyZB> you need to make the clones draggable again
[03:05:59] <DannyZB> and remove stuff that the ui.draggable adds
[03:06:16] <RikudoSennin> but why does it set it in the wrong place?
[03:06:40] <DannyZB> because I'm cloning an object being dragged
[03:06:44] <DannyZB> it has position properties
[03:06:54] <RikudoSennin> oh, I see
[03:06:55] <DannyZB> better off just copying the text inside it and leaving the elements intact
[03:06:58] <DannyZB> I got it all wrong
[03:07:17] <RikudoSennin> yes, but there might be some metadata involved with the elements
[03:07:27] <RikudoSennin> I haven't decided yet
[03:07:30] <DannyZB> so copy that metadata
[03:07:55] <RikudoSennin> I mean stuff in rel attribute or in data-stuff attributes
[03:08:52] <DannyZB> or you can just remove the "ui-draggable ui-droppable ui-draggable-dragged" classes , the positioning properties and use .draggable.droppable again
[03:09:04] <DannyZB> it isn't pretty but it's a way to do it , I don't think there is a better way
[03:09:41] <DannyZB> other than that the code stays intact
[03:09:45] <RikudoSennin> so basically we're making each cell draggable and droppable, and when one is dropped on another, the actio is reverted, the text and metadata is saved somewhere else, and then swapped between the cells, and then call an ajax to save it in the database
[03:10:16] <DannyZB> in essense , yes
[03:10:26] <DannyZB> essence*
[03:12:32] <RikudoSennin> I'll give it a shot
[03:12:46] <DannyZB> if you want to save it in the database you can save the data in a variable , switch the cell content with an ajax-loader and revert it if the ajax fails
[03:13:36] <DannyZB> it works I've done it before .. can't remember where I put the code
[03:25:17] <sharat87> hello, the keydown event does not seem to be working from a textarea, in firefox (using 5), but works fine in chrome. example http://jsfiddle.net/addyosmani/xEfSD/ ... what's wrong?
[03:25:25] <RikudoSennin> DannyZB: what is the instance of the dragged element and what's the instance of the dropped-on element?
[03:25:47] <DannyZB> RikudoSennin : dropped on ($(this) ) being dropped (ui.draggable)
[03:27:17] <RikudoSennin> good
[03:27:18] <RikudoSennin> http://jsfiddle.net/G4f3H/5/
[03:27:22] <RikudoSennin> there is some progress made :D
[03:29:07] <DannyZB> cool .. you're almost done
[03:30:19] <KingDosser> RikudoSennin: http://pastie.org/private/mnyhyaufxgkiy6pb1xdzmg Here you go :)
[03:30:44] <RikudoSennin> was just done myself :)
[03:30:46] <RikudoSennin> http://jsfiddle.net/G4f3H/6/
[03:31:13] <RikudoSennin> KingDosser: wassat?
[03:31:39] <RikudoSennin> DannyZB: http://jsfiddle.net/G4f3H/6/ :)
[03:31:52] <RikudoSennin> KingDosser: I think you confuse me with someone else :P
[03:32:59] <KingDosser> RikudoSennin: http://pastie.org/private/mnyhyaufxgkiy6pb1xdzmg Here you go :)
[03:33:03] <KingDosser> Sorry
[03:33:13] <RikudoSennin> lol :P
[03:33:15] <KingDosser> You said you don't understand my problem, like 40 mins ago. :)
[03:33:25] <KingDosser> I am having a problem with manipulating an element loaded using AJAX. I am adding html to an element then trying to resize that element. I do a console.log of the html before I call the resize function and it has the correct html but it wont reset it.
[03:33:33] <RikudoSennin> oh xD
[03:34:31] <DannyZB> nice stuff .. I'm bookmarking it man heh
[03:34:44] <RikudoSennin> DannyZB: :P still has room for improvement though
[03:34:55] <RikudoSennin> I want neat animations and stuf
[03:36:12] <RikudoSennin> DannyZB: I think of faking it, create bogus elements with the same stylings and values, animate it to absolute positioning, and then delete them once the value transfer was completed
[03:36:24] <DannyZB> RikudoSennin : no need for that
[03:36:32] <DannyZB> you have built-in effects in jquery
[03:37:02] <RikudoSennin> I know that, but since the inner HTML is getting swapped, and not the element itself, I can't really animate the actual element
[03:37:09] <RikudoSennin> so I need to use a clone
[03:37:11] <DannyZB> yes you can
[03:37:18] <DannyZB> use the jQuery transfer effect
[03:38:00] <DannyZB> $("#mini" + dialogID).effect("transfer",{ to: "#dialog" + dialogID, className: "do-dialog-transferring" },300,function(){ 			$("#dialog" + dialogID).switchClass("do-dialog-hidden",""); -> an excerpt from my code
[03:38:12] <DannyZB> the first element is the one being transferred
[03:38:19] <DannyZB> to is the element being transferred to
[03:38:29] <DannyZB> className is the class moved from one to the other
[03:38:46] <DannyZB> and then there is the callback for when the animation is complete
[03:38:50] <RikudoSennin> DannyZB: that's neat, is there any way to transfer more then the frame?
[03:38:59] <RikudoSennin> like the entire cell?
[03:39:06] <DannyZB> I don't think so .. but it would be ugly anyway
[03:40:52] <DannyZB> instead of 300 use a longer animation time like 600 and for the class use a class without background with a border: 1px dashed black
[03:44:35] <RikudoSennin> http://jsfiddle.net/G4f3H/8/
[03:44:36] <RikudoSennin> hmmm
[03:44:51] <RikudoSennin> @ DannyZB
[03:45:01] <DannyZB> wtf lol
[03:45:07] <DannyZB> something to do with the code probably
[03:45:28] <RikudoSennin> no, it's because the cell is actually there
[03:45:34] <RikudoSennin> draggable, positioning, remember?
[03:45:56] <RikudoSennin> also, it seems like the draggable isn't complete until AFTER the transfer
[03:46:00] <RikudoSennin> which isn't all that nice
[03:46:43] <DannyZB> I can think of ways to fix this
[03:46:48] <DannyZB> but i say .. instead
[03:47:04] <DannyZB> just switch the content of the cells with a gif-loader until the database update is complete
[03:47:13] <DannyZB> it would look more elegant
[03:47:55] <RikudoSennin> something like this..
[03:59:50] <KingDosser> Any ideas RikudoSennin?
[04:02:50] <DannyZB> KingDosser : do him a favor repost a question
[04:02:58] <DannyZB> the question *
[04:06:47] <quesor> Can anyone recommend a plugin which will scroll a line of text back and forth within its fixed width container if the text is too long to fit in the container.
[04:06:48] <RikudoSennin> DannyZB: http://pastie.org/2222030
[04:07:10] <RikudoSennin> DannyZB: where ajax-handle.php currently only has sleep(5); echo "OK!";
[04:08:40] <DannyZB> quesor : there is a non-standard element called marquee which is compatible with all browsers which does just that
[04:08:49] <DannyZB> <marquee> text scrolled </marquee>
[04:09:15] <quesor> DannyZB: marquee is the keyword Im using alright but Id rather stay away from the tag in favour of a plugin
[04:09:29] <RikudoSennin> quesor: there is a tag called marquee
[04:09:35] <RikudoSennin> a plugin called marquee*
[04:09:37] <RikudoSennin> check it out
[04:09:47] <DannyZB> http://jscroller.markusbordihn.de/
[04:09:48] <RikudoSennin> can work on a div as well
[04:10:05] <DannyZB> RikudoSennins : I didn't get the problem
[04:10:30] <RikudoSennin> I was referring to this one actually http://remysharp.com/demo/marquee.html
[04:10:36] <RikudoSennin> DannyZB: no problems, yet. :P
[04:10:48] <DannyZB> sure (:
[04:12:05] <pr0ton> what is the difference between keypress and keydown?
[04:12:40] <quesor> Ive looked briefly at the marquee one. The potential problem I am forseeing is that this animates regardless whereas Im ideally looking for something which only osciallates back and forth if the text cant all fit at once.
[04:13:06] <DannyZB> quesor : that shouldn't be a problem
[04:13:49] <DannyZB> just make sure that if the object is smaller than the parent element you put enough padding for it to not animate(ie nowhere needed to move)
[04:14:06] <DannyZB> or you can just check with javascript whether it requires animation in the first place
[04:14:15] <quesor> True
[04:14:21] <quesor> right, thanks\
[04:17:27] <KingDosser> I am having a problem with manipulating an element loaded using AJAX. I am adding html to an element then trying to resize that element. I do a console.log of the html before I call the resize function and it has the correct html but it wont reset it. http://pastie.org/private/mnyhyaufxgkiy6pb1xdzmg Here you go :)
[04:17:38] <KingDosser> @DannyZB and RikudoSennin
[04:22:30] <espressive_> Hi everyone
[04:23:03] <espressive_> Wondering if I am correct about something regarding jQuery
[04:23:41] <espressive_> Am I correct that just a we can shorted $(document).ready(function() { }); to $().ready(function() { });
[04:23:43] <RikudoSennin> DannyZB: alright
[04:23:46] <RikudoSennin> this is my final version
[04:23:47] <RikudoSennin> http://pastebin.com/Y8qqrEcR
[04:24:11] <espressive_> We can actually shorten that to $(function() { }); or is there a small difference I am not currently noticing?
[04:24:26] <RikudoSennin> espressive_: no difference
[04:24:42] <espressive_> ah, so even less typing ;)
[04:24:45] <RikudoSennin> DannyZB: while handler contains:     sleep(2);     echo mt_rand(0,1);
[04:25:26] <espressive_> Any reason why the use of this syntax is not more widely known or have I been sleeping under a rock?
[04:25:52] <RikudoSennin> espressive_: it was added later on, but it is widely used.
[04:26:26] <espressive_> ah ok, sweet. Picked it up in the jQueryUI source
[04:27:13] <espressive_> Seemed to mapped accordingly in the jQuery Core Source so I did couple of tests and it works as expected
[04:27:16] <espressive_> very cool
[04:27:16] <espressive_> thanks
[04:30:20] <DannyZB> RikudoSennin : I'm thinking about starting a public source-repository
[04:30:34] <RikudoSennin> doable
[04:30:35] <DannyZB> would fir there
[04:30:38] <RikudoSennin> a plugin maybe
[04:30:39] <DannyZB> fit*
[04:35:57] <espressive_> Anyone started or know off a NPM type system for jQuery plugins?
[04:36:26] <espressive_> npm with node is just awesome
[04:43:58] <Kivi_> is there a string underscore function in jquery, e.g MyString => my_string
[04:49:28] <theartisan> is there anywhere i can find an up to date list of jquery team members?
[05:30:05] <daniel2011z> whats the correct function to register a response to clicking on a radio button? tried .click() but that didn't work.
[05:38:42] <DannyZB> daniel2011z: yes it does
[05:39:07] <daniel2011z> DannyZB: ok, i'll double check my code. Thanks.
[05:39:12] <DannyZB> $("#radio-button").click(function(){ do something });
[05:41:38] <Stue> hey everyone
[05:41:58] <Stue> cool stuff uhh?!!
[05:42:45] <daniel2011z> # is for class right?
[05:42:52] <daniel2011z> no its id
[05:43:15] <Zeddy> Does anyone know why the jquerymobile channel is DEAD?
[05:43:33] <Zeddy> are they giving in to similar frameworks or are they just lazy chatters
[05:44:12] <Zeddy> one would think that jquerymobile and similar solutions would be growing like crazy, but based on the dead support channels it seems that people are not using it
[05:45:13] <DannyZB> daniel2011z : $(".class-something") is for class
[05:45:20] <DannyZB> $("#id-something") is for id
[05:45:27] <DannyZB> jquery uses css selectors
[05:45:34] <DannyZB> all css selectors are valid jquery selectors
[05:45:44] <DannyZB> even those not supported by the active browser
[05:46:09] <DannyZB> jQueryMobile is in alpha .. it's barely functioning in most platforms
[05:46:15] <DannyZB> I would check in on the forum instead
[05:49:03] <DannyZB> ok I take that back -> initial beta
[05:49:08] <DannyZB> but give it some time it's gonna be great
[05:49:39] <daniel2011z> DannyZB: how to do an alert?
[05:49:57] <Zeddy> i've been using it for quite some time and it has performed just fine in previous projects even though it is in Beta
[05:50:00] <DannyZB> alert window?
[05:50:04] <DannyZB> alert("alert something");
[05:50:10] <Zeddy> But this transition thing makes no sense
[05:50:16] <DannyZB> Zeddy : it barely works in opera mobile
[05:50:22] <DannyZB> same goes for opera mini
[05:50:33] <Zeddy> i don't really care about the non default browsers
[05:50:38] <Zeddy> they can suit themselves :P
[05:50:50] <DannyZB> Opera mini has a 30% mobile market share
[05:50:58] <DannyZB> thats like ignoring internet explorer
[05:51:11] <Zeddy> Which i usually prefer doing
[05:51:32] <DannyZB> thats your problem lol
[05:51:38] <DannyZB> Opera mini is an excellent browser
[05:51:49] <Zeddy> What makes Opera mini so great that 30% of the mobile users rather install it over the default browsers if it has lacking support for standard technologies :F
[05:52:16] <DannyZB> what makes it great?
[05:52:24] <DannyZB> its fast
[05:52:25] <DannyZB> it supports 99% of desktop websites
[05:52:27] <DannyZB> its efficient
[05:52:28] <DannyZB> it's stable
[05:52:40] <DannyZB> anything else?
[05:52:49] <tomh> hey guys, is there a version of jquery for jquery mobile without support for IE etc?
[05:53:44] <daniel2011z> DannyZB: confirmed that .click() doesnt work for radio buttons.
[05:53:56] <DannyZB> doesn't make sense
[05:53:59] <Zeddy> i think the default browser on my android can be consides fast, supports 99% of desktop websites, efficient and stable aswell
[05:54:14] <Zeddy> i see no point in installing a third party software to replace it
[05:54:26] <DannyZB> most people don't have android
[05:54:32] <DannyZB> and for android there is opera mobile
[05:54:41] <Zeddy> opera mini was great when the smartest phone on the market was a symbian with a really crappy browser
[05:54:43] <DannyZB> which is even better -and- supports nearly every browser feature
[05:54:54] <khaan> hi everybody
[05:55:54] <DannyZB> Zeddy remember that most people still don't have smartphones
[05:56:45] <Zeddy> If i want to develop for them i will use Qt, not web technologies
[05:56:50] <DannyZB> $("input[@name='rdio']").change
[05:57:06] <DannyZB> apparently radio buttons don't register click events in some browsers
[05:57:09] <DannyZB> wasn't used to it
[05:57:14] <DannyZB> you're right
[05:57:22] <DannyZB> Zeddy : thats an option , sure
[05:57:25] <Zeddy> i was a Qt developer for a couple of years, then they pretty much killed its future and decided to start developing for future devices rather then dying ones
[05:57:44] <BlaDe^> Hey guys - here's my code: http://pastie.org/private/tfoxeu47wh7ocavss1iwgw
[05:57:53] <BlaDe^> basically, you click a <td> and it opens a popup with that text so you can edit it and save via ajax
[05:57:57] <Zeddy> and the future is so fucked up atm that i decided to go with web-apps rather then going with a specific platform
[05:58:07] <BlaDe^> how do I save the clicked td so I can update the content of it after the save is complete?
[05:58:37] <DannyZB> Zeddy : I'm a programmer and work in web-development right now .. solely because jQuery is a joy to use
[05:58:41] <DannyZB> so simple , elegant
[05:58:49] <DannyZB> same goes for Qt
[05:58:56] <DannyZB> the best development platforms out there
[05:59:03] <Zeddy> yep, so it was
[05:59:04] <Zeddy> :p
[05:59:18] <Zeddy> well it still is, but not for mobile development
[05:59:43] <Zeddy> Anyways, if theres anyone even remotely familiar with jquerymobile, have a look: http://www.kokonniemi.fi/guide/index.php/view/map/1/1
[05:59:59] <daniel2011z> DannyZB: more bad news .change()
[06:00:14] <daniel2011z> DannyZB: more bad news .change() doesn't work either...
[06:00:19] <DannyZB> it does
[06:00:20] <DannyZB> one sec
[06:00:32] <DannyZB> http://www.techiegyan.com/2008/07/09/using-jquery-check-boxes-and-radio-buttons/
[06:00:36] <DannyZB> check that page out
[06:01:24] <DannyZB> Guys .. what would get you to check out my facebook app?
[06:01:42] <Zeddy> A link?
[06:02:11] <DannyZB> apps.facebook.com/diskonline
[06:02:18] <DannyZB> http://apps.facebook.com/diskonline
[06:02:23] <DannyZB> all built around jQuery
[06:02:30] <DannyZB> no IE7 support yet
[06:03:25] <DannyZB> too tired to write the help documents right now heh if you have any questions just ask
[06:03:46] <daniel2011z> DannyZB: thanks. the jquery doc should be updated to explain you need to do more than just use selectors to get radio buttons to work
[06:04:13] <DannyZB> sure no problem man
[06:04:38] <Zeddy> ugh
[06:04:43] <Zeddy> Please select folder to upload to
[06:05:04] <DannyZB> lol I know most errors aren't with alert boxes
[06:05:15] <DannyZB> this is one of the last ones I didn't change
[06:05:17] <DannyZB> still beta (:
[06:05:28] <DannyZB> you need to create a folder
[06:05:30] <Zeddy> But you should force users to create the folder before allowing them to upload if its mandatory to have a folder for upload
[06:05:54] <DannyZB> thats exactly why I rather let guys like you have access first
[06:05:59] <DannyZB> I'll make sure to do it today
[06:06:13] <DannyZB> if you want I can give you 2.5gb instead of the regular 1.5gb
[06:06:17] <Zeddy> Is it possible to have modal dialogs in facebook btw?
[06:06:17] <DannyZB> all I need is for you to use it
[06:06:24] <DannyZB> nope
[06:06:27] <DannyZB> I coded them myself
[06:06:28] <Zeddy> thats a shame
[06:07:15] <DannyZB> there's a reason for that
[06:07:21] <DannyZB> facebook has a very strict security model
[06:07:31] <DannyZB> inter-frame access can help scammers
[06:08:24] <BlaDe^> How can I figure out the index of a <td> within a <tr> ?
[06:08:33] <BlaDe^> my selector is: $('#table-1 .fileboxtd td:not(:first)').click(function() { });
[06:08:43] <BlaDe^> I want to know if i click the 2nd, 3rd or 4th td
[06:08:46] <ajpiano> BlaDe^ $(this).index()
[06:08:56] <BlaDe^> oh, that easy huh :-), thanks
[06:09:05] <motaka2> How to get all check box elements inside a div ??
[06:09:29] <BlaDe^> motaka2 $('div input[type=checkbox]') ?
[06:09:34] <DannyZB> Zeddy : what do you think?
[06:12:09] <DannyZB> btw did what you said no more dialo
[06:12:11] <DannyZB> dialog *
[06:12:12] <daniel2011z> DannyZB: still can't get .change() to work on radio button. i'm using IE8 :S
[06:12:47] <DannyZB> daniel2011z : those code snippets are usually correct,  check if you made a mistake elsewhere
[06:13:24] <daniel2011z> DannyZB: hmm... seems ok.... i'll jsfiddle and show you.
[06:14:09] <Zeddy> DannyZB, i like it, i just think the upload dialog is a bit messy for the eye, it takes a while to notice the upload part of the dialog since its following the same color scheme as the main page, i would try to make the dialog stand out more
[06:14:39] <Zeddy> modal would have been a good solution but i get why its not possible, but making the dialog itself darker or giving it a more colorfull background could help a bit
[06:15:09] <Zeddy> also, i'd like to see a (X) somewhere on the dialog
[06:15:15] <DannyZB> I'm planning to give the display titles a blue-ish background
[06:15:18] <DannyZB> there is an X
[06:15:21] <DannyZB> on the top right
[06:15:24] <Zeddy> took me a few seconds to find where i close / minimize it, especially since ESC didn't do it :p
[06:15:42] <Zeddy> DannyZB, i don't see it :D
[06:15:52] <DannyZB> you found it eventually?
[06:15:53] <Zeddy> ill put up a screenshot
[06:15:57] <DannyZB> sure
[06:16:04] <DannyZB> what browser are you using?
[06:17:00] <Zeddy> http://img842.imageshack.us/img842/4308/diskonline.jpg
[06:17:03] <Zeddy> chrome, latest version
[06:17:25] <Zeddy> the only way to close it was using the arrow below the dialog
[06:17:30] <Zeddy> not close, but minimize
[06:17:52] <DannyZB> I'm using chrome .. weird
[06:18:05] <DannyZB> ohhhh that dialog
[06:18:12] <DannyZB> I thought you were talking of the file displays
[06:18:21] <DannyZB> you just need to click the upload bar below to close it
[06:18:29] <Zeddy> Chrome 12.0.742.122
[06:18:32] <DannyZB> I guess it's not as obvious as I thought
[06:18:37] <daniel2011z> DannyZB: confirmed it worked in jsfiddle but not locally on my IE8 :(
[06:18:56] <Zeddy> my point, it wasn't obvious at first, but if you use it on a regular basis it would not be a problem
[06:19:09] <DannyZB> daniel : did you set the callback before or -after- the element was created?
[06:19:15] <DannyZB> sure man
[06:19:28] <DannyZB> I'll just put a minimize button for people who don't get it
[06:19:43] <DannyZB> check out the image viewer I built
[06:19:47] <DannyZB> zoom+pan
[06:19:58] <Zeddy> yeah i tried it out, works nice
[06:20:12] <DannyZB> on the left there is something I call "disks"
[06:20:17] <DannyZB> it's made for sharing
[06:20:18] <daniel2011z> DannyZB: umm the script is in the header so before.
[06:20:31] <DannyZB> daniel : you must set a callback after the element is created
[06:20:49] <DannyZB> ie inside $(document).load(function(){ set everything here } );
[06:21:02] <DannyZB> Zeddy: you drag and drop files to those "disks"
[06:21:14] <DannyZB> and you'll be able to send them to friends in the near future
[06:21:27] <DannyZB> images in albums get compressed there with an option to download the original
[06:21:44] <daniel2011z> DannyZB: the element is registered on DOM ready function...
[06:22:16] <fabiobik> Hi guys
[06:22:27] <DannyZB> there is no way your code is correct if it doesn't work
[06:22:32] <DannyZB> do you use a javascript debugger?
[06:22:55] <fabiobik> how to reload or refresh an specific area of an page?
[06:23:13] <DannyZB> if you click the "lock" icon a folder is made public
[06:23:20] <DannyZB> I need to make that more obvious though lol
[06:23:32] <fabiobik> example on table if i delete an record, do the refresh
[06:23:38] <fabiobik> but only on the table
[06:24:11] <DannyZB> fabiobik : no simple way to do that
[06:24:13] <danny2011zz> sorry got dced
[06:24:17] <DannyZB> what you want is ajax
[06:24:52] <DannyZB> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[06:25:14] <DannyZB> daniel : I don't know , probably some sneaking error
[06:25:17] <DannyZB> use a javascript debugger
[06:25:28] <DannyZB> preferebly FireBug + FireQuery
[06:26:35] <DannyZB> Zeddy : seen any weird shit happen with the app:?
[06:28:15] <danny2011zz> do ID have to unique for the element/tag or unique among all element tags?
[06:28:59] <DannyZB> what do you mean?
[06:29:11] <DannyZB> you have an element id , element classes and an element type
[06:29:15] <DannyZB> those are the 3 basic selectors
[06:29:25] <DannyZB> an element id needs to be unique
[06:29:34] <DannyZB> classes can be spread among many elements
[06:29:51] <danny2011zz> unique for that tag or all HTML tags?
[06:30:10] <DannyZB> for that tag
[06:30:14] <DannyZB> otherwise whats the use?
[06:30:39] <danny2011zz> eg. <h1 id="foo"></h1><h2 id="foo"></h2>
[06:30:46] <danny2011zz> is that fine?
[06:30:53] <motaka2> how can I understand if a check box is selected ?
[06:31:04] <DannyZB> no
[06:31:07] <DannyZB> absolutely not
[06:31:23] <DannyZB> if anything then <h1 class="foo"></h1><h2 class="foo"></h2>
[06:31:34] <sinuc> howdy
[06:31:45] <DannyZB> $("#checkbox").is(":selected")
[06:31:54] <danny2011zz> DannyZB: right so has to be unique among all tags.
[06:32:00] <DannyZB> yes
[06:32:38] <DannyZB> Zeddy: thanks anyway
[06:33:20] <sinuc> could someone be so kind and point out ones "favorite" blowfish library to shorten my search? :)
[06:34:53] <motaka2> DannyZB: is this query right  ?
[06:34:55] <motaka2> checkBoxes = $('table.shls-search-res input[type=checkbox]').is(":selected");
[06:35:16] <DannyZB> yes
[06:35:25] <DannyZB> if shls-search-res is the table class
[06:35:39] <DannyZB> one sec what are you trying to accomplish?
[06:35:46] <DannyZB> you want all selected checkboxes?
[06:35:57] <motaka2> Danny yes
[06:35:57] <DannyZB>  [16:34] <motaka2> checkBoxes = $('table.shls-search-res input[type=checkbox]:selected');
[06:39:05] <motaka2> DannyZB: It gives me an emty array
[06:39:24] <DannyZB> are any of the checkboxes selected?
[06:40:02] <DannyZB> and how do you know it's an empty array?
[06:42:01] <motaka2> DannyZB: Yes there are some selected and I use console.log(checkboxes);
[06:42:21] <DannyZB> jsfiddle it
[06:42:26] <DannyZB> your errors are too cryptic
[06:45:39] <motaka2> DannyZB: I cant make it work with jsfifddle , so many external resources that cant be addeed to it
[06:45:54] <DannyZB> look .. the code is correct
[06:45:58] <DannyZB> you made a mistake elsewhere
[06:46:27] <DannyZB> try console.log($('table.shls-search-res input[type=checkbox]').length)
[06:46:32] <DannyZB> maybe you got the selectors wrong
[06:48:39] <motaka2> DannyZB: look at this from line 60s :  http://pastebin.com/RxFRQWJy
[06:49:45] <DannyZB> you get a 0 length?
[06:49:48] <motaka2> console.log(length) gives me zerro
[06:50:02] <motaka2> DannyZB: Yes, it gives me 0
[06:51:29] <DannyZB> open it with a debugger seriously
[06:51:32] <DannyZB> is probably some hidden error
[06:52:06] <motaka2> DannyZB: This is the correct form:   checkBoxes = $('table.shls-search-res input[type=checkbox]:checked');
[06:52:16] <DannyZB> one sec
[06:52:20] <motaka2> it must be checked not selected
[06:52:22] <DannyZB> you are using :selected for checkboxes
[06:52:25] <DannyZB> exactly!
[06:52:26] <DannyZB> lol
[06:52:45] <DannyZB> thought you were using radio buttons at first
[06:52:59] <motaka2> DannyZB: Thank you, since I dont know mch about jquery , your helps give me the clues
[06:53:36] <DannyZB> sure man
[06:53:39] <DannyZB> btw
[06:53:45] <DannyZB> stackoverflow.com is your friend
[06:53:50] <DannyZB> loads of jQuery answers there
[06:54:14] <motaka2> thats greate I will use it more, if not filtered
[06:55:51] <motaka2> DannyZB: is this right ?  selectedShlsIds[checkBoxesCounter] = checkBoxes[checkBoxesCounter].value;
[06:56:32] <DannyZB> no
[06:56:39] <DannyZB> the selectedShlsIds array is shorter
[06:56:59] <motaka2> DannyZB: line 76 http://pastebin.com/RxFRQWJy    gives me undefined , dont know why
[06:58:02] <DannyZB> checkBoxes[checkBoxesCounter].val()
[06:59:07] <BlaDe^> this is a bit of a longshot but any ideas why: $('input[value=' + edit.data('contact') + ']').parent().find('td').eq(edit.data('index')-1).text(edit.val());
[06:59:15] <BlaDe^> works in every browser except IE9 ?
[06:59:42] <DannyZB> check the explorer console?
[06:59:50] <motaka2> DannyZB: firebug says:   checkBoxes[checkBoxesCounter].val is not a function
[06:59:51] <motaka2> [Break on this error] selectedShlsIds[checkBoxesCounte... = checkBoxes[checkBoxesCounter].val();\n
[07:00:05] <DannyZB> sometimes explorer browsers are more sensitive to earlier syntax errors
[07:00:15] <black_warlock> anyone good with asp and jq who can help me setting up progress bar ?
[07:00:24] <BlaDe^> DannyZB no errors are there
[07:00:29] <black_warlock> for an uploader?
[07:00:42] <DannyZB> no errors doesn't mean no issues
[07:00:52] <BlaDe^> sure, but I have no idea how to find issues in the developer tools in IE
[07:01:17] <black_warlock> use Firefox
[07:01:26] <DannyZB> oh I know why *
[07:01:28] <BlaDe^> but it works in firefox......
[07:01:36] <DannyZB> checkBoxes[checkBoxesCounter].value -> this isn't a reqular array , it's a jquery list
[07:01:48] <DannyZB> use checkBoxes.eq(checkBoxesCounter).val()
[07:02:31] <BlaDe^> black_warlock it works in firefox and chrome
[07:02:34] <bjensen> what plugin do people use now a days to add the placeholder attribute on inputs when viewed in IE7?
[07:02:42] <motaka2> DannyZB: Cache problems , now works fine
[07:03:03] <DannyZB> motaka2 : get used to it , explorer browsers are very sensitive
[07:03:10] <DannyZB> mostly those are not errors
[07:03:17] <black_warlock> IE7 ?????????? :O
[07:03:38] <DannyZB> I hate IE7 ><
[07:03:41] <black_warlock> its the worsest browser ever seen , microsoft has retired it !
[07:03:45] <DannyZB> Just drop support for it
[07:03:50] <DannyZB> no it's not
[07:03:53] <DannyZB> IE6 hands down
[07:04:07] <black_warlock> its bugged like the hell and nobody should be using it for security issues
[07:04:34] <bjensen> thats not really an answer I can use. I have paying customers who use IE7 :)
[07:04:36] <DannyZB> it's bugged like hell? it -IS- hell
[07:04:52] <DannyZB> I'm gonna add support for it eventually
[07:05:04] <black_warlock> infact microsoft has distribuited IE8 free
[07:05:04] <DannyZB> now I just leave the "f you get another browser in nice language" thing :)
[07:05:30] <motaka2> I HATE MICROSOFT< AND YOU ALL DO TOO, JUST CONFESS!!
[07:05:52] <DannyZB> I don't hate microsoft
[07:06:00] <DannyZB> I merely wish gates a slow and miserable death
[07:06:34] <stan> i've used a selector to find a textbox - $('#mytextbox') - how do i then get the plain javascript textbox object?
[07:06:51] <DannyZB> $("#mytextbox")[0]
[07:07:11] <black_warlock> well who still uses ie7 is a newb ! and they shouyld not be able to open any other website correctly
[07:07:50] <black_warlock> css render engine sux also
[07:09:20] <motaka2> black_warlock: Lots of people use IE6 in my country
[07:09:36] <black_warlock> o my gawSH !
[07:09:51] <black_warlock> where do you leave africa ^_^ ?
[07:10:05] <black_warlock> live*
[07:11:10] <black_warlock> ie6 , it means plp are using win 98 ?
[07:13:50] <mecode> how can i access the name of an object's property? For example, say i have * object.properties: {propertyA: {name: 'propertyAName'}, propertyB: {name: 'propertyBName'}} * How can I then alert to the screen "propertyA"? Not propertyA's properties, but literally the name of the key.
[07:14:37] <black_warlock> 'name=pip'
[07:14:54] <ajpiano> for (k in object.properties) { alert(k); }
[07:16:00] <poppiez> hi, I'm doing some JS for ipads. I've attached a gesturechange evt like this: $(document).bind( 'gesturechange', function( e ) { console.log( e ); } ); however, my event parameter is undefined. anyone know why?
[07:19:18] <poppiez> works if I do window.ongesturechange = function( e ) { console.log( e ); }; so it must be a jquery prob
[07:23:04] <poppiez> problem also confirmed here: http://j-query.blogspot.com/2010/05/using-jquery-for-iphoneipad-pinch-zoom.html - can't find a fix on google
[07:25:33] <poppiez> oh, apparently you have to use e.originalEvent.scale instead of e.scale. weird
[07:26:20] <ajpiano> poppiez: yeah, jQuery doesn't move a lot of arbitrary properties onto jQuery.Event
[07:26:59] <ajpiano> poppiez: if you want it to transfer onto the event
[07:27:00] <poppiez> ajpiano: good to know. I wish I knew an hour ago ;-)
[07:27:01] <ajpiano> you can try doing
[07:27:24] <ajpiano> jQuery.event.props.push("state");
[07:28:08] <bjensen> hmmm Im looking at the source of https://github.com/dciccale/placeholder-enhanced ..shouldnt it just be enough to include the script? I cant get it working in IE7 but the demo does.. The demo init is here: https://github.com/dciccale/placeholder-enhanced/blob/master/js/demo.js but I dont see anything related to binding etc in it
[07:29:52] <motaka2> $drawBtn = $("#selected-units input['type=button']");   how to check if $drawBtn is empty or not ?
[07:30:16] <bjensen> motaka2: check the length
[07:30:31] <ajpiano> motaka2 input[type='button']
[07:30:36] <ajpiano> not ['type=button']
[07:30:41] <Zol> When do you know/how can you tell that all images in a selection have loaded correctly?
[07:30:59] <Zol> Can you make a callback to animate images as they finish loading?
[07:31:09] <poppiez> ajpiano: neat! I wasn't aware of that possibility
[07:31:42] <ajpiano> Zol: basically, you just have to use the images .load callback
[07:31:52] <ajpiano> but it can be tricky because that doesn't always fire for cached images
[07:31:54] <ajpiano> https://gist.github.com/268257
[07:32:44] <Zol> Gehr.. ajpiano - thanks!
[07:38:22] <Zeddy> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/transition-not-working-correctly-on-android-when-using-mobile-changepage-page-id
[07:39:19] <motaka2> do we have something like in_aaray in javascript ?
[07:39:39] <ajpiano> ?inArray @ motaka2
[07:39:40] <bot-t> motaka2, jQuery.inArray(value, array): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[07:50:14] <soldo33> ive got this file upload button, and the user clicks on it to select a file to upload. At that point I want the upload to commence in a browser popup window (not DHTML layer type dialog), this seems to be problematic, as in not possible?
[07:53:08] <soldo33> because the file upload field is on the parent page, i can't just have the upload in a popup window, the reason i want that is because the upload can continue while the user navigates away
[07:55:19] <soldo33> I could indeed put the upload field inside the popup, but that means the user presses the upload button, gets presented with a popup, they then have to press another button which opens another popup for  selecting the file, its kind of ugly
[07:56:29] <dannyzb> why would that be a problem?
[07:56:39] <dannyzb> set "target=_blank" in the upload form
[08:00:07] <soldo33> I will try that, I assumed that the upload would still execute in the parent window (thereby locking it up) and the response would be in another window, but i have not tested it
[08:07:12] <BlaDe^> Can anyone see why this works on every browser except ie 7, 8 and 9: http://jsfiddle.net/p7EGq/2/
[08:18:26] <dannyzb> why the hell would you use input value as a selector
[08:18:40] <dannyzb> obviously explorer is interpreting the value differently which is reasonable
[08:18:47] <dannyzb> pick a selector that doesn't change as easily
[08:19:53] <BlaDe^> dannyzb you're wrong
[08:20:09] <BlaDe^> there's nothing wrong wit using an input value as a selector, and it doesn't change - it's a static value.
[08:20:20] <Anticom> hi all
[08:20:22] <dannyzb> well as a fact I changed it
[08:20:23] <dannyzb> and it work
[08:20:25] <dannyzb> worked*
[08:20:32] <dannyzb> in IE8
[08:20:33] <BlaDe^> dannyzb yes I said it works, just not in IE
[08:20:35] <Anticom> what encoding is $.ajax() using?
[08:20:40] <dannyzb> I tried it in IE
[08:21:15] <BlaDe^> dannyzb do you have chrome frame or something?
[08:21:19] <dannyzb> NO
[08:21:21] <dannyzb> IE8
[08:21:24] <BlaDe^> "The property is read/write for all objects except the following, for which it is read-only: COL, COLGROUP, FRAMESET, HEAD, HTML, STYLE, TABLE, TBODY, TFOOT, THEAD, TITLE, TR."
[08:21:34] <BlaDe^> their docs state .innerhtml of a tr is readonly
[08:21:42] <dannyzb> well .. it works for me
[08:21:49] <BlaDe^> apparently you're the only one :S
[08:21:57] <dannyzb> ...
[08:22:04] <dannyzb> many standards are not followed
[08:22:11] <dannyzb> one sec
[08:22:14] <BlaDe^> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/155426/why-does-ie-give-unexpected-errors-when-setting-innerhtml
[08:22:16] <dannyzb> td isn't in that list
[08:22:28] <BlaDe^> but if the tr is readonly do you think you can write to the td ?
[08:22:34] <dannyzb> yes !
[08:22:35] <dannyzb> of course
[08:22:41] <dannyzb> it has nothing to do with it
[08:22:55] <dannyzb> the innerhtml of tr is readonly to prevent display errors
[08:22:59] <dannyzb> obviously it can cause issues
[08:23:06] <dannyzb> with TD's there shouldn't be an issue
[08:23:34] <BlaDe^> I have ie9, if i set it to ie7 or 8 browser mode it doesn't work
[08:23:44] <ajpiano> BlaDe^: put the input inside of a TD
[08:23:46] <ajpiano> ffs.
[08:24:05] <BlaDe^> oops, yeah. That's not good :-)
[08:24:08] <BlaDe^> but I don't think it's causing my issue
[08:24:42] <BlaDe^> or... not
[08:25:13] <dannyzb_> ><
[08:25:24] <BlaDe^> well, that was unexpected :-) thanks ajpiano
[08:25:34] <dannyzb_> what was the solution?
[08:25:39] <dannyzb_> my internet died for a sec
[08:26:06] <dannyzb_> s
[08:26:14] <BlaDe^> the top input wasn't in a td
[08:26:16] <BlaDe^> ie doesn't like that
[08:27:19] <dannyzb_> why would you put an input in a tr?
[08:27:27] <dannyzb_> use colspan=""
[08:27:28] <necromancer> does anybody here use an MVC framework for their JavaScript?
[08:27:43] <necromancer> like backbone or knockout
[08:27:45] <necromancer> if so, which one?
[08:28:06] <ajpiano> Backbone
[08:28:08] <ajpiano> like a bawwse
[08:35:31] <necromancer> ajpiano: is that the framework i "should" be working in if i want to do jQuery?
[08:35:35] <necromancer> ;)
[08:35:47] <ajpiano> well the really lovely part is really
[08:36:01] <ajpiano> the amount of actual like 'jQuery' you write becomes really minimal
[08:36:12] <MaximusColourum> with backbone?
[08:36:17] <ajpiano> yeah
[08:36:20] <MaximusColourum> I've never heard of either of those.
[08:36:25] <MaximusColourum> I'll have to check'm out
[08:36:27] <ajpiano> backbone is the bomb
[08:36:37] <necromancer> well here's the thing
[08:36:40] <MaximusColourum> like a bawwse you said, ?right
[08:36:45] <ajpiano> indeed
[08:36:48] <necromancer> i was using Typo/Rails for my blog but i really got tired of hacking it
[08:36:53] <necromancer> so now i want to use jekyll
[08:36:56] <ajpiano> i'm on my 3rd backbone app in like 4 months
[08:37:01] <ajpiano> ah
[08:37:02] <necromancer> but now that i'm using jekyll it's a little harder to "partialize" everything out
[08:37:11] <ajpiano> i've been meaning to try out jekyll for a particular project
[08:37:15] <necromancer> and i thought of a really good ajax-based UI that also falls back to just a regular blog UI
[08:37:29] <ajpiano> so you'd want like templated out areas
[08:37:29] <MaximusColourum> dreamer
[08:37:30] <necromancer> yeah it's pretty cool once you get the hang of it
[08:37:33] <necromancer> yeah basically
[08:37:38] <ajpiano> yeah backbone is so much win for that
[08:37:40] <necromancer> MaximusColourum: not quite. it's all in the markup :)
[08:38:01] <ajpiano> cause you can just build all your html snippets up as templates using whatever templating engine you like
[08:38:55] <ajpiano> and then create Backbone views from them... and then delegation is really terse and organised on those views
[08:39:39] <MaximusColourum> I know, I was playing around necromancer
[08:39:55] <necromancer> ajpiano: yeah that's what i was really excited about
[08:40:19] <ajpiano> necromancer: it's amazing how quickly you can prototype an app and in such little code
[08:40:29] <ajpiano> as when you use backbone with router and localstorage shim for backbone
[08:40:38] <necromancer> the way i see it, jekyll takes care of the site's architecture and the "model" layer (which also includes the content), and backbone is the view & controller.
[08:40:41] <necromancer> err not backbone
[08:40:44] <necromancer> javascript/jquery
[08:40:59] <necromancer> oh shit you're right ajpiano
[08:41:14] <necromancer> i could probably make a non-working index.html right now to see how this UI is going to work
[08:41:24] <ajpiano> yeah, i'd encourage you to
[08:41:49] <ajpiano> cause then you can just load in pretend data into localstorage
[08:42:08] <ajpiano> and then you're good to go when real live data with the same schema gets connected
[08:42:45] <ajpiano> necromancer https://github.com/jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage
[08:42:47] <ajpiano> whoops
[08:42:55] <ajpiano> https://github.com/ajpiano/Backbone.localStorage :D
[08:43:07] <necromancer> why do i need a shim for that? doesn't chrome support localstorage?
[08:43:20] <ajpiano> yeah ofc
[08:43:21] <necromancer> (this is just for a personal site so no one's seeing it but me)
[08:43:36] <ajpiano> what that adapter does is makes it so you can write Backbone models and collections to localstorage
[08:43:42] <necromancer> ooooohhhh okay
[08:43:46] <necromancer> like activerecord ;)
[08:43:51] <ajpiano> so when you do like var Post = new Post().save() it goes somewhere
[08:44:00] <Toidi[Away]> How can I find out if $(this).text() has "blah" in it?
[08:44:04] <ajpiano> mine does sessionStorage too and doesn't leak globals
[08:44:07] <ajpiano> like the one it's forked from :p
[08:44:20] <ajpiano> Toidi[Away], $(this).text().indexOf("blah") > -1
[08:44:48] <ajpiano> or just if (~$(this).text().indexOf("blah")) { }
[08:47:37] <motaka2> is this right ? /msg NickServ identify <password>
[08:47:58] <motaka2> is this right ?   if( !$.inArray ( selectedShlsIds[counter] , selectedShlsIds ) )
[08:49:22] <Anticom> is there a simple way to get GET-parameters from the url in jq?
[08:49:43] <ajpiano> Anticom: there's nothing directly in jq for parsing it unless you use say, the BBQ plugin
[08:49:48] <necromancer> Anticom: nah, but there's a simple way to get it in Javascript
[08:49:53] <necromancer> like pure javascript
[08:49:59] <ajpiano> yeah, what necromancer said
[08:50:10] <Anticom> *feature request* (:
[08:50:29] <Anticom> necromancer okay so how can i do that in js?
[08:50:44] <necromancer> Anticom: window.location returns the entire URL
[08:50:56] <necromancer> so just parse that out for the GET values
[08:51:08] <necromancer> you're gonna have to parse it twice, once for "?" to separate the vars from the host
[08:51:15] <necromancer> and then once for "&" to separate the key-value pairs
[08:51:30] <necromancer> so you'll be left with an array of strings like "key=value"
[08:51:41] <necromancer> then you can parse that for "=" and get the second result, and you got your value
[08:51:52] <ajpiano> well not technically
[08:52:03] <necromancer> eh i'm just kinda doing it from memory at this point :)
[08:52:13] <ajpiano> he can start with window.location.search :p
[08:52:23] <necromancer> wait
[08:52:24] <necromancer> what
[08:52:29] <motaka2> is this right ? if( !$.inArray ( selectedShlsIds[counter] , selectedShlsIds ) )
[08:52:36] <ajpiano> window.location got properties
[08:52:44] <necromancer> omg..
[08:52:48] <necromancer> you gotta be kidding me
[08:52:50] <necromancer> i never knew that
[08:52:50] <ajpiano> necromancer: not only that
[08:52:52] <necromancer> is that new?
[08:52:56] <ajpiano> every single anchor element has the same properties
[08:53:07] <ajpiano> DOME == BLOWN
[08:53:09] <ajpiano> no
[08:53:16] <motaka2> no one for me /
[08:53:18] <motaka2> ?
[08:53:45] <necromancer> motaka2: try it
[08:53:46] <ajpiano> looks fine to me motaka2
[08:53:59] <ajpiano> well... i mean
[08:54:02] <ajpiano> it isn't a valid if
[08:54:08] <necromancer> ajpiano you definitely just blew my dome
[08:54:10] <ajpiano> if isn't a function
[08:54:11] <necromancer> f'real
[08:54:30] <motaka2> ajpiano: but it doesnt prevent to inser duplicated data
[08:54:32] <ajpiano> necromancer: ya it's really awesome like if you have to... rewrite links to be a different domain or something like that
[08:54:54] <ajpiano> motaka2: debug
[08:55:06] <Anticom> ajpiano, necromancer thanks
[09:03:19] <motaka2> how to check to see if a variable is undefined?
[09:03:32] <necromancer> motaka2: typeof var == 'undefined'
[09:03:49] <necromancer> that works for other things to like 'number' or 'object' or 'string'
[09:08:25] <motaka2> how can we add a cell at end of an array ? array_pop  etc ?
[09:08:28] <Edokter> hi there. can anyone help with jquery animation?
[09:10:40] <motaka2> How can I insert members in an array in jscript ?
[09:12:37] <motaka2> no help ?
[09:12:48] <DefV> array.push(member)
[09:12:53] <DefV> array.unshift(member)
[09:14:06] <necromancer> motaka2: ##javascript is for pure JS questions as well, and plus they are better equipped to tell you how to write proper JS
[09:14:30] <Edokter> Am I correct to asume that slideUp store the element's original height somewhere?
[09:15:29] <necromancer> Edokter: yeah, CSS. ;)
[09:15:57] <necromancer> Edokter: i would assume that too but if i were you, i'd save that height value before the slideUp()
[09:16:26] <Edokter> actually, I'd like jquery to forget that height.
[09:17:32] <Edokter> here's what Im trying to do... I have an UL that I slide up, change class that turns it into a holizontal list, then slide out horizontal.
[09:18:08] <Edokter> but it only slides out until the ul's original width, then jump to the desired width.
[09:18:42] <Edokter> (same goes for height in reverse)
[09:23:16] <Edokter> so I'm looking for a way to make the animation use the element's *new* dimensions
[09:28:35] <motaka2> does this peace of code prevents me from inserting duhttp://pastebin.com/NxajHMMq
[09:28:40] <motaka2> http://pastebin.com/NxajHMMq
[09:31:06] <motaka2> no one there?
[09:32:17] <Iarfen> Hi
[09:32:47] <Iarfen> How I can execute a event when the user uses the keyboard to move around the options in a select??
[09:33:20] <Iarfen> I make a function that executes when the user clicks on the option, but I need that this function executes too when the user moves the options around the keyboard
[09:34:00] <motaka2> does this peace of code prevents me from inserting du http://pastebin.com/NxajHMMq
[09:41:11] <whateverb> Is it possible to set speed for animate() function? and not in milliseconds..if I use anchor slider then its not moving smoothly with milliseconds
[09:42:59] <pickels> How can I focus to an input field when it gets created? I have a library other than jquery creating an input field.
[09:51:19] <onykage> would it be insainly difficult to display a sliders value on the slider button using jQueryUI?
[10:03:43] <Fox`> how are you supposed to post data with an & in using ajax?
[10:03:58] <onykage> you dont use &
[10:04:05] <onykage> $.post()
[10:04:41] <Rhoxus> Serialze your form before sending
[10:04:53] <Fox`> what's the difference between post() and ajax()?
[10:05:34] <onykage> does anyone know how to put a value of a slidebar onto the sliderbutton using the UI slider() ??
[10:06:57] <onykage> ajax(); is a generic call statement for ajax related operations, post(); is a vanilla function to specifically perform a post call to some sort of backend
[10:07:35] <onykage> http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/
[10:08:35] <onykage> and yes as Rhoxus stated you may benefit from using serialize instead of a static post call
[10:09:28] <onykage> isnt there a ui channel?  anyone know the name of the channel?
[10:18:39] <lastk> sadmicrowave : yo, I have found this lib SheepItForm but it dont work with the jquery.mobile lol I'm not lucky haha
[10:19:23] <onykage> does anyone know a way to attach a value to the uiSliderHandle?
[10:26:35] * abjorn wiggles
[11:22:36] <pr0ton> guys i needed to ask something. has anybody of you used asana?
[11:22:48] <pr0ton> i want to have two sections. one would be scrolling, the other would be fixed
[11:46:21] <Phelms215> Hey, can I do .. #DivIDinput[name="otherSourcesAmount"]
[11:46:37] <Phelms215> to get the input field otherSourcesAmount in the div id DivID
[11:49:02] <onykage> is it possible to assign an id to the slider handle or a unique class perhaps?
[11:49:32] <pr0ton> Phelms215, yes
[11:49:55] <pr0ton> i think it's #DivID input[name="otherSourcesAmount"]
[11:50:28] <pr0ton> sorry
[11:50:32] <pr0ton> #DivID > input[name="otherSourcesAmount"]
[11:50:41] <pr0ton> if you meant, input contained inside a div with DivID
[11:51:10] <pr0ton> onykage, can you rephrase your question?
[11:51:17] <pr0ton> you want to assign an id to a div?
[11:52:38] <onykage> pr0ton: i was wondering on the slider ui, if there is a way to give it some kind of unique identifier, such as an id or class so when you have multiple sliders all in the same form/page you can augment a single slider and not all sliders on the page
[11:52:57] <pr0ton> sure you can
[11:53:11] <pr0ton> .attr('id', yourId);
[11:53:12] <onykage> pr0ton: im trying to make the slider handle display the slider value
[11:53:36] <pr0ton> maybe something like "slider" + sliderCount++;
[11:53:43] <onykage> pr0ton: ty ty let me try that
[11:54:07] <onykage> pr0ton: didnt think about the attr() .. *slaps self*
[11:54:15] <pr0ton> onykage, haah, it's ok
[11:55:58] <onykage> pr0ton: ok wait, the only way i can find to access the sliderHandle is via the class, thus if I use attr() like that it will give all sliders the same ID
[11:58:21] <onykage> pr0ton: http://pastie.org/2223628
[11:58:47] <pr0ton> nope
[11:58:50] <pr0ton> you can use a trick
[11:59:05] <onykage> pr0ton: oh, do tell
[11:59:40] <pr0ton> var count = 0; $('.slider').each( $(this).attr('id', 'slider-' + count++); }
[11:59:45] <pr0ton> sorry
[11:59:51] <pr0ton> .each( function() { ... } );
[11:59:57] <onykage> yea yea
[12:00:00] <onykage> gotcha
[12:00:15] <onykage> lemme give that a shot
[12:10:16] <necromancer> you guys know of any backbone.js screencasts?
[12:14:06] <Fernandos> necromancer: I've not seen them, but have seen that there are some one sites with RoR background
[12:14:50] <necromancer> hmm
[12:14:57] <necromancer> not sure if that would help me
[12:15:07] <necromancer> i'm trying to build a rich ajax UI with a jekyll-powered blog
[12:16:26] <Fernandos> and what's the problem?
[12:17:36] <Fernandos> better don't consume examples but make some examples. you could run through the backbone.js tutorial if you that's what you look for.. http://arturadib.com/hello-backbonejs/
[12:26:44] <onykage> pr0ton: each() worked great
[12:27:06] <pr0ton> onykage, good to know :)
[12:29:50] <onykage> pr0ton: toss me a pp link in priv and i'll toss you a beer
[12:31:05] <pr0ton> pp link?
[12:31:44] <pr0ton> onykage, pp link?
[12:31:55] <onykage> paypal email
[12:37:39] <ch3mical> Posted this late last night, but here it is again. In case anyone was wondering, I found a work around for sending XML with namespaces in jQuery AJAX requests... https://plus.google.com/112556850082362131447/posts/1apok7SvMFF
[12:45:29] <stan> when i do $('#myform').submit(function() { blah; }) does jquery use the form's onsubmit attribute?
[12:51:35] <Techdeck> hey guys, anyone knows how do I detect whether a certain css property is supported or not? specifically I want to check if text-overflow: ellipsis is supported
[12:51:44] <djQuery> stan: it binds to the onsubmit yes
[12:52:08] <djQuery> Techdeck: ?.support
[12:52:21] <djQuery> ?.support@ Techdeck
[12:52:22] <bot-t> Techdeck, jQuery.support: A collection of properties that represent the presence of different browser features or bugs. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/
[12:52:48] <djQuery> Techdeck: dont think it is as complete as it could be though
[12:53:05] <Techdeck> awesome, thank you!
[12:54:32] <gnarf> http://www.bramstein.com/projects/text-overflow/ @Techdeck (2 seconds on google)
[12:54:33] <djQuery> Techdeck: you might have better luck with see ?modernizr
[12:54:33] <bot-t> Techdeck, a feature detection javascript library that determines support for all sorts of html5 and css3 goodness. http://modernizr.com
[12:54:34] <Techdeck> hmm, I don't see that specific css property there :(
[12:55:14] <djQuery> gnarf: hey budy
[12:56:01] <Techdeck> I don't see how to detect that css property in that plugin
[13:06:15] <mbutubuntu> hello folks, I've a strange behaviour with a callback function; I've 2 divs with class='foo'; if I run $('.foo').fadeOut(function(){alert("hello")}); I get two alerts... I'm not using .each() so it's strange that the callback is executed n times as n divs
[13:07:06] <pr0ton> mbutubuntu, check in console what $('.foo') returns
[13:07:08] <pr0ton> it returns a list
[13:07:13] <pr0ton> i think each is implict
[13:07:51] <pr0ton> it is indeed implicit
[13:07:56] <mbutubuntu> so how to treat a class as a single object with only a single callback execution?
[13:08:06] <pr0ton> $('.foo:first') ?
[13:08:43] <pr0ton> since there n candidates, you need to choose which one right?
[13:08:50] <mbutubuntu> pr0ton, I need to fadeOut all 'foo' but I need to execute only a single callback :-)
[13:09:19] <mbutubuntu> even triggering an event it will trigger the event two times...
[13:09:45] <pr0ton> mbutubuntu, i dont understand actually
[13:09:59] <pr0ton> ok i think i do
[13:10:33] <mbutubuntu> pr0ton, I need to make an action on more elements calling only a single callback when all elements are altered
[13:10:41] <pr0ton> maybe a hacky way would be to set a variable, called = false;
[13:10:58] <pr0ton> then inside call back run if (!called) { called = true; //do whatever }
[13:11:17] <pr0ton> define called outside in local scope of the place where u call the fadeOut
[13:11:22] <mbutubuntu> ok, I thought jquery had something integrated
[13:11:33] <pr0ton> mbutubuntu, thats why i said, 'hacky' ;)
[13:12:11] <mbutubuntu> yes... often hacking is the better way :-)
[13:12:31] <pr0ton> anyway this is the intended behavious
[13:12:35] <pr0ton> **behaviour
[13:12:45] <pr0ton> i'm not sure if there is anything 'integrated' in jquery
[13:12:50] <pr0ton> depends how you define it though
[13:29:01] <tallisman> How would you guys simulate function overloading in javascript? :p, Theoretically you can use arguments keyword.. but is this the way to go?
[13:29:22] <snover> yes.
[13:30:26] <tallisman> @snover, thanks ^^
[13:33:58] <TheIronSky> OY!! SNOVER
[13:34:10] <snover> what?
[13:34:18] <TheIronSky> I had no idea you still existed
[13:35:08] <clarkbox> snover you can also use pass a single argument that is an object with multiple (optional) parameters
[13:35:13] <clarkbox> thats how jquery does it
[13:36:04] <clarkbox> that way you dont need to worry about order
[13:37:38] <snover> clarkbox: first, I don’t know why you are saying that to me; second, that isn’t simulating function overloading, that’s just creating a function that accepts a hash map
[13:37:47] <snover> a good idea but not what was being asked
[13:38:30] <systemfault> There's no overloading in JS
[13:38:48] <systemfault> You _can_ dispatch depending on the type of arguments
[13:39:00] <systemfault> Most jQuery plugins does it.
[13:39:02] <snover> key word “simulate”
[13:40:09] <snover> TheIronSky: there is a reason that I have a low profile :P
[13:40:31] <TheIronSky> snover: and that would be?
[13:41:13] <snover> because I’m working on other things, and because questions like these drive me a little crazier each time
[13:41:20] <systemfault> Haha
[13:42:26] <TheIronSky> You're not the only one - I've had my fair share of 'bat f*** insane" moments
[13:45:10] <TheIronSky> one time when i was high on cough medicine i lost all cognitive grasp of the existance of time and realized that time is relative to one's level of consciousness which explains why time can go quickly or slowly at the same time depending on the level of occupation stimulating the consciousness and this cough medicine stimulated my consciousness to a point that time was condensed into a...
[13:45:11] <TheIronSky> ...single moment
[13:50:56] <djQuery> anyone got a idea on how to store globals for a ui.widget factory plugin?
[13:51:44] <Fernandos> djQuery: loading a json config probably is elegant..
[14:00:03] <tuv> most table plugins interpret a large number with commas in it as a string, breaking sorting :( - using datatables here
[14:41:10] <mikeycgto> so script tags (in HTML5) don't need a type attribute anymore
[14:41:23] <mikeycgto> does anyone know how this is going to behave in IE? mainly IE7/8?
[14:42:00] <gnarf> ?tias @mikeycgto
[14:42:01] <bot-t> mikeycgto, Try It And See
[14:42:02] <BinaryKitten> mikeycgto if you worry about older browsers then don't rely on HTML5
[14:42:07] <gnarf> but
[14:42:24] <gnarf> Just FYI - jQuery test suites are written without type="text/javascript"
[14:42:52] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/blob/master/test/index.html
[14:43:01] <gnarf> and they work fine in IE6/7
[14:43:27] <gnarf> wow
[14:43:33] <gnarf> is there really no closing </html> on that doc
[14:43:35] <gnarf> I suck
[14:43:37] <gnarf> ...
[14:43:40] <ch3mical> lawl
[14:43:42] <mikeycgto> lol
[14:43:52] <mikeycgto> k cool, was just curious
[14:44:19] <mikeycgto> not to worried about IE6 since, we don't support it
[14:45:05] <gnarf> wee fixed: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/blob/master/test/index.html
[14:45:06] <gnarf> ;)
[14:48:53] <ne7work> Hello all, I have one question where is the official place to learn javascript?
[14:48:57] <ne7work> It is jquery.com ?
[14:50:07] <BinaryKitten> ne7work jquery isn't javascript.. jquery is written in javascript..
[14:50:11] <gnarf> ?101
[14:50:12] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[14:50:16] <ne7work> I mean
[14:50:23] <ne7work> jQuery, not JavaScript
[14:50:23] <gnarf> ?leanring
[14:50:23] <BinaryKitten> :)
[14:50:25] <bot-t> gnarf, Learning jQuery - Tips, Techniques, Tutorials - http://www.learningjquery.com/
[14:50:25] <ne7work> my mistake
[14:50:39] <bot-t> ne7work, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[14:50:40] <ne7work> well for what is jquery.com?
[14:50:43] <gnarf> nice job bot-t
[14:51:17] <ajpiano> ne7work,uh for distributing it, hosting documentation, forums, etc etc
[14:51:19] <tuv> most table plugins interpret a large number with commas in it as a string, breaking sorting :( - using datatables here. is there a way around this? i.e. keep the commas and get correct sorting
[14:51:21] <BinaryKitten> jquery.com is the central hub for jquery
[14:51:26] <ajpiano> we are in the process of converting the book i just linked you to into a learning site
[14:51:29] <ajpiano> but it is not complete yet
[14:52:37] <ne7work> well can I learn from http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page ?
[14:53:25] <BinaryKitten> you can probably ne7work
[14:53:25] <Iarfen> Hi
[14:53:37] <ne7work> okay thanks guys
[14:53:39] <ne7work> goodnight all
[14:53:39] <BinaryKitten> ne7work how is your javascript?
[14:53:52] <ne7work> well I don't know, but JavaScript is easy?
[14:54:12] <BinaryKitten> i would recommend learning javascript
[14:54:15] <Iarfen> How I can make that everytime I call a Ajax function jQuery displays a image (or a text) (to say "loading...") and that when the ajax calls finished that image or text dispears??
[14:54:19] <BinaryKitten> jquery is simple in comparison
[14:54:28] <ne7work> okay I'll see tomorrow
[14:54:32] <ne7work> now I go to sleep
[14:54:34] <ne7work> goodnight guys :)
[14:54:42] <Iarfen> I need to make it for all ajax calls at the same time, to not make it everytime I use an Ajax call to make the code more easy to write on
[14:54:42] <BinaryKitten> ?ajaxstart @ Iarfen
[14:54:43] <bot-t> Iarfen, .ajaxStart(handler): Register a handler to be called when the first Ajax request begins. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStart/
[14:54:55] <Iarfen> ok ty
[14:54:55] <BinaryKitten> ?ajaxend @ Iarfen
[14:54:56] <bot-t> Iarfen, jQuery.ajax() - Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[14:55:04] <BinaryKitten> urm lol
[14:55:10] <BinaryKitten> ?ajaxstop @ Iarfen
[14:55:19] <BinaryKitten> it's something like that lol
[14:55:54] <BinaryKitten> Iarfen  with ajaxStart it triggers on ANYthing
[14:56:12] <BinaryKitten> so you bind it on the element you want to show or interact with
[14:56:30] <Iarfen> but I can't make that it works for all elements??
[14:56:41] <Iarfen> I have the same image to use for all the cases
[14:57:04] <BinaryKitten> eg $('#ajaxLoadImg').ajaxStart(function() { $(this).show(); });
[14:57:32] <BinaryKitten> it will trigger for ALL ajax requests
[14:57:39] <BinaryKitten> not just for ones targeting that elem
[14:57:46] <Iarfen> ok ty
[14:58:02] <BinaryKitten> see http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/global-ajax-event-handlers/ for the full list
[15:01:31] <PhonicUK> howdy all
[15:02:12] <PhonicUK> What would you guys call this type of UI element? http://i.imgur.com/4qIJM.png
[15:02:25] <PhonicUK> I'm pretty sure they're called breadcrumbs, not sure if there's another name/convention for it
[15:03:18] <ajpiano> yup
[15:03:28] <PhonicUK> cool
[15:03:35] <PhonicUK> i'm writing myself a nice breadcrumb plugin for jquery
[15:03:39] <alaing> yeah wassup ppl
[15:03:59] <BinaryKitten> define breadcrumb plugin
[15:04:25] <alaing> cheese and lettuce with extra mayo
[15:04:26] <BinaryKitten> what is doing/going to do
[15:05:14] <alaing> going to eat it
[15:05:37] <PhonicUK> BinaryKitten, this markup + code ( http://pastebin.com/mQa4m1aV ) produces the breadcrumbs in that image
[15:06:00] <PhonicUK> working on making it highlight properly now on mouseover
[15:06:16] <BinaryKitten> PhonicUK  what does it do that CSS doesn't
[15:06:50] <PhonicUK> with just CSS you'd have to add a bunch more elements for the joints between elements, and the first/last element
[15:06:58] <PhonicUK> so it makes it easy
[15:08:16] <BinaryKitten> ok. most of the situations i deal with breadcrumbs in are link based ..
[15:08:23] <BinaryKitten> does the plugin support that?
[15:08:49] <PhonicUK> you'd just drop <a> tags inside the spans
[15:08:57] <PhonicUK> so it doesn't prelude using links
[15:10:47] <PhonicUK> ive just switched to using ul and li instead of div and span though, definitely better
[15:11:53] <BinaryKitten> PhonicUK  would recommend make a default.. but allow customisation
[15:12:20] <PhonicUK> i likely will
[15:12:32] <PhonicUK> its more about making the presentation easy rather than any actual logic
[15:12:47] <PhonicUK> the only tricky logic is switching the right images out when the user hovers
[15:12:58] <PhonicUK> or rather, switching to the right part of the sprite
[15:14:28] <BinaryKitten> use spritecow
[15:14:36] <BinaryKitten> and css classes
[15:14:48] <PhonicUK> ive just made the sprite and classes by hand
[15:15:27] <PhonicUK> where the arrow overlaps the element coming after it, that part is actually a single image
[15:15:32] <PhonicUK> so there need to be 3 different images for it
[15:15:38] <PhonicUK> none highlighter, one before, and one after
[15:16:33] <Iarfen> when I use ajaxStart, how I can access to the x and y property of the element where is loading the ajax (if there's one)?
[15:27:11] <BinaryKitten> Iarfen  have you checked the event.target?
[15:27:21] <Iarfen> ok ty
[15:28:39] <BinaryKitten> it's hard because it's not a traditional event
[15:34:00] <justicefries> hello gentlemen
[15:38:04] <BinaryKitten> justicefries what about the rest of us? don't we get a hello?
[15:38:47] <justicefries> let me consider it.
[15:38:51] <justicefries> hello. :)
[15:38:53] <justicefries> ladies.
[15:42:45] <snover> BinaryKitten: http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gentlemen
[15:43:35] <snover> GENTLEMEN.
[15:44:40] * BinaryKitten doesn't find that an amusing meme
[15:45:08] <BinaryKitten> pangs of the whole "omg girls on the intarwebs" rubbish
[15:46:39] <snover> BinaryKitten: it is what you make of it. if you decide it is misogynistic, that is your choice
[15:47:28] <BinaryKitten> heh I like how it's my choice
[15:48:28] * BinaryKitten returns to being quiet.. as the subject is rapidly going off topic
[15:50:25] <justicefries> wookiehangover: sup
[15:51:23] <wookiehangover> yo
[15:54:07] <justicefries> NO DEAD PIXELS ON THIS ONE
[15:54:08] <justicefries> thus far
[15:55:17] <wookiehangover> yay
[15:55:45] <wookiehangover> multiple jst templates in 1 file now
[15:55:46] <wookiehangover> https://github.com/wookiehangover/jquery-tmpl-jst
[15:55:48] <wookiehangover> yay
[15:56:36] <justicefries> i've decided I don't like mustache/handlebars.
[15:56:40] <justicefries> fwiw
[15:56:58] <justicefries> in fact it offends me.
[15:57:06] <wookiehangover> running out to best buy to get some v-games
[15:57:08] <wookiehangover> be back soon
[15:57:12] <justicefries> what're you getting?
[16:12:46] <PhonicUK> woo my breadcrumb plugin works :D
[16:12:51] <PhonicUK> its finished more or less
[16:13:09] <BinaryKitten> cool
[16:15:52] <PhonicUK> < 5K of images, 2.76K of css+js before minification
[16:22:05] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/2hwnv/ ... On update it is checking if( $this.parent().hasClass('stage-buffer') )  how does body hasClass('stage-buffer') ?
[16:22:18] <innociv> It should only return true if dropped between the orange lines
[16:23:19] <BinaryKitten> innociv you forgot var for $this
[16:23:19] <innociv> or rather..
[16:23:23] <innociv> oh
[16:23:51] <BinaryKitten> that might get confused as to what it is meant to be
[16:24:16] <innociv> well it's still returning that stage-buffer is the parent to stage-group that aren't children of stage-buffer
[16:24:24] <innociv> If you drop them under the numbers instead of between the lines
[16:26:05] <BinaryKitten> ok give me a moment
[16:27:07] <innociv> I think I see the problem actually
[16:27:25] <BinaryKitten> what do you think it is?
[16:27:30] <innociv> Yeah nvm
[16:27:37] <innociv> it's how I'm using the each
[16:28:01] <BinaryKitten> what was your intent?
[16:29:17] <innociv> Ugh.  Yeah that's what I was about to say. http://jsfiddle.net/2hwnv/8/  When you drop a group onto stage-group that is within stage-buffer, I want to have stage-buffer removed and a new <div class="stage-buffer"><div class="stage-group"></div></div> added before and after it.
[16:29:43] <innociv> and relist the numbers at the top of each group.
[16:29:56] <innociv> Seems simple but I'm fumbling on it.
[16:30:09] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/2hwnv/9/
[16:30:15] <BinaryKitten> was a small change i just made
[16:30:28] <BinaryKitten> that was before i saw your update here
[16:31:12] <innociv> Yeah
[16:32:01] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/2hwnv/11/ does the insertAfter fine, but it closes all the other .stage-buffers
[16:33:01] <innociv> well I sort of know something, hang on
[16:33:22] <BinaryKitten> still wondering if you've lost the context of this
[16:33:30] <BinaryKitten> * of "this"
[16:34:39] <innociv> No
[16:41:56] <innociv> I got it
[16:42:04] <innociv> But there is one other thing I need that I can't figure out.
[16:42:45] <BinaryKitten> what's that?
[16:43:33] <innociv> When you click on one of those narrow grey boxes, .piece, I need to make a new <ul class="group">/* <li> for the clicked piece, and all pieces to the right of it</li>*/</ul> that is being sorted.  Right now if you click any piece you're sorting the entire group, which should only happen when clicking the first piece
[16:43:58] * tuv loves datatables.net
[16:45:16] <PhonicUK> I abuse display:table-cell far too much ;\
[16:45:54] <systemfault> PhonicUK: Nothing's wrong with that... as long as you don't intend to support less than IE8
[16:46:13] <PhonicUK> good point, I haven't tried it in IE7
[16:46:21] <systemfault> Won't work at all.
[16:46:40] <PhonicUK> its annoying, using inline-block with 0 margin+padding doesn't give the result I want
[16:46:49] <PhonicUK> i.e. the elements aren't perfectly next to eachother with no gaps
[16:47:05] <systemfault> Would floats work?
[16:47:12] <PhonicUK> that's a point
[16:47:13] <PhonicUK> i'll check
[16:47:18] <systemfault> It should
[16:47:37] <PhonicUK> aside from the text now being in the wrong position, it's fine
[16:47:50] <PhonicUK> you can't use vertical-align:middle on a block :(
[16:48:06] <systemfault> Do you have an example online?
[16:48:12] <systemfault> I might be able to help
[16:48:13] <PhonicUK> i can put one up
[16:48:15] <PhonicUK> give me 1 sec
[16:49:32] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/qG2ss/11/ got the first part working.  Now I need the breaking up groups to work
[16:49:36] <PhonicUK> i've not given myself create directory permission on my own FTP -__
[16:49:41] <systemfault> :P
[16:49:41] <PhonicUK> derp
[16:49:45] <innociv> And I need to combine groups of same types..
[16:51:17] <innociv> wait what hte hell.
[16:51:37] <PhonicUK> uploading...
[16:52:25] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/qG2ss/13/ if you drag one between the empty lines, then back into another group, it screws up..
[16:53:24] <innociv> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'clientTop' of null jquery-1.6.2.js:8639
[16:54:48] <PhonicUK> systemfault, http://phonicuk.com/Breadcrumb/index.html
[16:54:51] <PhonicUK> see the breadcrumbs
[16:55:12] <PhonicUK> when i use table-cell and vertical-align:center, the text fits nicely in the middle
[16:55:55] <PhonicUK> (also, what do you think of my plugin? :)
[16:56:16] <systemfault> PhonicUK: add: line-height: 34px to .breadcrumb_e
[16:56:35] <systemfault> What is your plugin?
[16:56:55] <PhonicUK> the thing that creates the breadcrumb
[16:57:07] <PhonicUK> look at the markup thats there :)
[16:57:07] <systemfault> Ahhh, thought it was some jqueryui thing
[16:57:14] <PhonicUK> nope, thats what i made
[16:57:25] <PhonicUK> fits in nicely with jquery-ui doesn't it?
[16:58:13] <PhonicUK> only problem i've got is the image in the first crumb isn't at the correct place
[16:58:24] <PhonicUK> but if i put text in that crumb, it is
[16:58:26] <systemfault> I like it :)
[16:58:41] <PhonicUK> i could just be lazy and position-absolute it
[16:58:46] <PhonicUK> eh, relative rather
[16:58:49] <systemfault> The line-height: 34px should have fixed the text.
[16:58:53] <PhonicUK> indeed
[16:59:00] <PhonicUK> just not any inline images
[17:01:32] <PhonicUK> systemfault, sticking a margin on the image worked well enough without feeling too hacky
[17:01:33] <PhonicUK> http://phonicuk.com/Breadcrumb/index.html
[17:02:09] <beute> hi all, i need a little help knowing how the jquery UI calendar picker function works. reason being, i need a way to make a time picker, similar to the one used on google.com/calendar
[17:02:22] <systemfault> PhonicUK: Looks nice.
[17:02:28] <PhonicUK> ty :)
[17:02:37] <PhonicUK> i'm probably going to make it freely available
[17:02:43] <PhonicUK> some CC licence
[17:06:34] <misterm> beute: what exactly do you need help with?
[17:07:24] <beute> misterm: like the date picker function works, i need to know how it auto hides when a field is not focused and the div itself is not in focus... but a div cant have a focus so i dont get how it works
[17:07:53] <misterm> beute: download jQuery UI and check out the source
[17:08:12] <beute> it is too confusing, lol
[17:08:14] <beute> i need laymens terms
[17:08:59] <misterm> beute: Im still not clear on what you're stuck on, sorry
[17:09:35] <misterm> beute: what div do you mean?
[17:09:45] <beute> misterm: ok, if u try to use the jquery ui datepicker (as seen here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/) you can click in the form field and it will fade in a div... which is the calendar
[17:09:59] <misterm> beute: yea
[17:10:07] <atxq> heys guys, how can I append at the beginning f a tag?
[17:10:21] <misterm> beute: should be pretty easy to replicate with an input and .focus() and blur()
[17:10:40] <beute> misterm: you can lose focus of the form field, and the calendar will still stay appeared. (IE. click somewhere in the calendar, and it will lose focus of the form- calendar stays)
[17:10:56] <beute> misterm: but if you click anywhere else on the page, another field... whatever it may be... the calendar will then hide.
[17:11:14] <beute> misterm: that exact functionality is what i want to replicate ^^
[17:11:47] <misterm> beute: do you have a prototype?
[17:12:03] <beute> yes i was working on one yesterday but i cant get the logic right
[17:12:26] <beute> http://jsfiddle.net/mxwK2/3/
[17:12:30] <misterm> your best bet is to put the prototype up in a jsfiddle or something and get help making incremental improvements
[17:13:29] <misterm> beute: ok and what precisely is the problem here
[17:13:47] <beute> that small example will be part of an entire website...
[17:14:47] <ProLoser|Mobile> anyone here use modernizr?
[17:14:50] <beute> misterm: now the problem is- i need to hide that timepicker field when either the timepick form loses focus AND the timepicker div is not in focus... but div's dont have that functionality of "being in focus"
[17:15:26] <misterm> beute: ok, well the first step would probably be to attach a blur listener to the input
[17:16:06] <beute> misterm: ok so, $('timepick').blur(function() {
[17:16:43] <misterm> beute: yea, and then you just need to determine if the popup is in use, and not hide the popup if it is
[17:17:14] <beute> misterm: how can i determine if a div is on focus?? lol my big dilemma of div's cant have a "focus" functionality.
[17:17:19] <misterm> beute: tbh I'm not sure precisely what jQuery UI does, but you could use things like mouseover, click listeners, etc to detrmine if the popup is being used
[17:17:37] <misterm> beute: well you seem intent on wether or not it's in "focus" when it seems like what you really[#jquery] jQuery UI does, but you could use things like
[17:17:52] <misterm> *really want is wether it's in use or not
[17:18:22] <beute> does this help any? i got this from another code
[17:18:45] <beute> misterm: http://pastebin.com/pe86wtun
[17:19:44] <beute> misterm: in that code, #sliderwrap is an element like #timepicker and .clock is a button
[17:19:48] <misterm> beute: this is just a tiny bit of code taken out of context, so no it's not terribly useful....but it looks like it's part of something implementing what Im telling you to do
[17:20:58] <beute> misterm: i feel like that does the function i need, or will guide me to the right place. but i dont understand it completely
[17:21:32] <misterm> beute: well yea, like I said...it looks like something like what I'm telling you to do
[17:22:00] <misterm> beute: you just need to ask yourself what it means for your user to be interacting with your popup and then not hide it if that is happening
[17:22:40] <beute> hmm
[17:25:22] <beute> misterm: thanks again for the help ive got to go out somewhere but i feel like i should have this figured out tonight
[17:26:20] <misterm> beute: np
[17:52:32] <PhonicUK> wooo its official
[17:52:33] <PhonicUK> sort of
[17:52:33] <PhonicUK> http://code.google.com/p/jquery-breadcrumb/
[17:53:48] <coldhead> good work, PhonicUK !
[17:54:21] <PhonicUK> seen it in action?
[17:55:21] <coldhead> trying to!
[17:56:05] <PhonicUK> http://phonicuk.com/Breadcrumb/index.html
[17:57:15] <compufreak> Why so many li's?
[17:57:29] <PhonicUK> there aren't that many in the original source
[17:57:43] <PhonicUK> it has to insert a load before/after the actual elements
[17:59:05] <BinaryKitten> PhonicUK instead of taking the li and inserting more
[17:59:14] <BinaryKitten> take the contents and manipulate it
[17:59:33] <PhonicUK> i'd have to add more elements inside it still
[17:59:44] <BinaryKitten> otherwise you're breaking compatability for screen readers and other accessibility items
[17:59:56] <BinaryKitten> inside the li isn't an issue
[18:00:30] <BinaryKitten> $(li).children().wrapAll('div') ?
[18:01:01] <PhonicUK> i'll check it out later
[18:01:48] <PhonicUK> What do you think appearance wise?
[18:02:08] <BinaryKitten> appearance is ok
[18:02:32] <BinaryKitten> PhonicUK does it still work under 1.6.2?
[18:03:05] <PhonicUK> yup
[18:03:14] <compufreak> Looks good, you could also try psuedo elements with fallback to jquery
[18:03:27] <compufreak> css :before and :after
[18:03:45] <PhonicUK> hmm
[18:04:07] <PhonicUK> could be doable
[18:05:14] <coldhead> any you thought your work was done, PhonicUK :)
[18:05:22] <coldhead> and*
[18:05:26] <PhonicUK> nah i knew this was just a quick thing that i'd come back to
[18:05:34] <PhonicUK> works well enough for now that im happy to let people use it
[18:05:42] <BinaryKitten> a good plugin author is never happy
[18:05:47] <PhonicUK> lol
[18:05:48] <snover> I like your decision to ignore rules about variable declarations and just let that tc go right to the global scope, PhonicUK
[18:05:50] <coldhead> yeah i hate people with screen readers too
[18:05:53] <coldhead> trouble makers!
[18:05:57] <compufreak> Phonic: might be worth a look http://jsfiddle.net/westonruter/eAVp2/
[18:06:00] <coldhead> blind people GET OFF THE INTERNET
[18:06:01] <snover> you’re a rebel with a cause!
[18:07:41] <PhonicUK> :P
[18:08:27] <BinaryKitten> PhonicUK take note that we care enough to tell you these things
[18:08:32] <PhonicUK> indeed
[18:09:22] <ziggles> Would anyone mind helping me out with this? http://pastie.org/private/ctwe6ersbkgpp5iiynjkq   I've been flying through work all day and have been stuck on that issue for like 30 minutes  :/
[18:09:48] <ajpiano> ziggles: see ?forloopscope
[18:09:48] <bot-t> ziggles, http://forum.jquery.com/topic/binding-event-to-element-dynamically#14737000000958061
[18:11:25] <ziggles> ajpiano: checking.
[18:11:34] <PhonicUK> i hate javascript sometimes xD
[18:11:51] <ajpiano> ziggles: ok, i pretty much am sure it is what the problem is :)
[18:11:57] <systemfault> Javascript is concentrated fun
[18:12:26] <ziggles> LoL
[18:12:36] <ziggles> ajpiano: Dang. i think this is it.
[18:12:46] <PhonicUK> tada, put everything in a namespace to be nice
[18:12:52] <ziggles> ajpiano: would you suggest i replace BOTH for loops with $.each ?
[18:13:48] <ajpiano> it looks like you'll have to
[18:13:59] <ziggles> ajpiano: k... rewriting it now. thank you
[18:14:04] <ajpiano> welx
[18:14:29] <PhonicUK> BinaryKitten, i take it these are all the same folleys made by most who first write a plugin?
[18:14:37] <BinaryKitten> even me
[18:14:54] <BinaryKitten> though i'm not sure it's most..
[18:15:00] <BinaryKitten> like ajpiano wouldn't have
[18:15:12] <BinaryKitten> but that's because he's unicorn powered
[18:15:18] <ajpiano> haha
[18:17:38] <PhonicUK> its funny, im more proud of this tiny little plugin than some of the huge peices of software i've written that have taken hundreds of man hours
[18:18:06] <coldhead> because you like the elegance of this?
[18:18:12] <PhonicUK> yeah
[18:18:24] <coldhead> cool :)
[18:19:25] <BinaryKitten> it feels like you're bending some big thing to your will right PhonicUK?
[18:19:40] <PhonicUK> indeed, but its still weird considering the scale of things
[18:19:42] <BinaryKitten> even if you're still working on it at 2am
[18:20:31] * BinaryKitten = Brit also
[18:21:48] <BinaryKitten> currently i'm having fun coverting a pdf table into an ini file
[18:22:41] <coldhead> ew
[18:22:50] <BinaryKitten> which part coldhead?
[18:22:58] <coldhead> the whole project!
[18:23:04] <coldhead> HOW DID THAT ARISE
[18:23:11] <BinaryKitten> royal mail postage rates
[18:23:19] <coldhead> ah! si si si
[18:23:23] <coldhead> well defended
[18:23:38] <coldhead> i will discard my analogies then
[18:23:48] <BinaryKitten> ini file to pull the values easily in ZF
[18:24:21] <BinaryKitten> i'll be posting a blog post with a component to help with weight based shipping
[18:24:35] <BinaryKitten> but meh
[18:25:12] <PhonicUK> i should sleep
[18:25:22] <BinaryKitten> heh 2:25am.. i agree
[18:25:25] <BinaryKitten> good night PhonicUK
[18:25:35] <PhonicUK> I don't want to though xD
[18:25:39] <PhonicUK> i want to work on some other project now..
[18:25:59] <PhonicUK> i have to stop myself from doing my day-job work during the weekend
[18:26:05] <PhonicUK> doesn't help that i work from home 3 days a week
[18:26:44] <operhiem1> I'm trying to get a div that only scrolls down to encompass new lines if it's already at the bottom. As evident from my jsfiddle is http://jsfiddle.net/TEbSP/3/ , my atBottom() always returns false. I got it from http://yelotofu.com/labs/jquery/test/scrollbottom.html , where it seems to work. What am I missing?
[18:27:30] <PhonicUK> operhiem1, if each new line is in its own element, you could just check if the last element is visible?
[18:28:30] <operhiem1> PhonicUK: That makes sense for this application, but in the full program HTML is loaded from a server, so it wouldn't work there.
[18:28:44] <operhiem1> Oh I misread
[18:28:55] <operhiem1> That does seem like it would work, yes.
[18:28:58] <coldhead> i combat that separate accounts on my gombuters, PhonicUK
[18:29:02] <coldhead> that with*
[18:29:24] <PhonicUK> operhiem1, it's what i do for a running server log in one of my web apps
[18:29:40] <PhonicUK> so it only keeps scrolling down if you're at the bottom
[18:30:01] <allbad_> howdy
[18:30:43] <allbad_> quick question about sortable jquery ui widgets:
[18:30:56] <allbad_> what are you guys doing to make the sort persistent?
[18:31:54] <coldhead> allbad: ajax and a db on the server
[18:32:52] <PhonicUK> night everyone
[18:33:50] <allbad> i like db too (was my first thought)... any other methods y'all are using?
[18:34:02] <dwarder> why this doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/qqXyX/3/
[18:34:26] <coldhead> allbad: http://diveintohtml5.org/storage.html
[18:34:45] <dwarder> upon <select> change i want radio button change it's state ...
[18:35:02] <dwarder> anyone has an idea why it doesn't work
[18:36:45] <dwarder> please take a look
[18:37:19] <operhiem1> PhonicUK: I made a try at that, but it seems I'm missing something as it now always returns true: http://jsfiddle.net/TEbSP/5/
[18:37:31] <allbad> coldhead: that looks interesting... i hadn't thought about client-side storage
[18:37:32] <ajpiano> dwarder: .checked isn't something you can set on a jQuery object
[18:37:49] <operhiem1> Relevant lines are var last = $('#messages-pane li').filter(':last');
[18:37:49] <operhiem1>     return last.is(':visible');
[18:38:00] <coldhead> what other alternatives could there be, allbad? db on the server or db on the client...
[18:38:13] <ajpiano> operhiem1, just do .last() instead of .filter(":last")
[18:38:42] <ajpiano> dwarder, do .attr("checked", "checked") instead of checked = true;
[18:39:23] <dwarder> ajpiano: thank you
[18:39:33] <operhiem1> Good, last() exists. I wonder why I didn't see it the first time. :\
[18:39:44] <allbad> true; file vs. database.  i've already got a database in my app so that makes sense.  if however i didn't....
[18:40:01] <operhiem1> Using last() doesn't change its behavior, though, so it's still always returning true.
[18:40:16] <allbad> for say a webpage aggregator w/ no need for database, then maybe server-side file
[18:40:50] <ajpiano> operhiem1: there are better ways to detect if a container is scrolled to the bottom :)
[18:41:03] <ajpiano> let me figure out one of them for you
[18:41:03] <ajpiano> :p
[18:41:23] <operhiem1> ajpiano: I'd love to hear them. I was trying http://yelotofu.com/labs/jquery/test/scrollbottom.html but something was wrong with the way I was doing it and it was always returning false.
[18:45:11] <coldhead> serverside file storage doesn;'t scale
[18:45:18] <coldhead> and it always fucks up somehow
[18:45:31] <coldhead> mostly when your indian ISP chmod's the directory wrong for no good reason
[18:46:53] <coldhead> not that i'm bitter
[18:53:29] <allbad> :
[18:53:30] <allbad> :)
[18:54:03] <ajpiano> operhiem1, how's this suit ya
[18:54:04] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/TEbSP/8/
[18:54:22] <ajpiano> operhiem1: there's kind of a fundamental problem here which is that animatiing the container triggers more scroll events, and so on and so forth
[18:54:39] <ajpiano> but that seems to be at least a worthwhile test of if it is close to the bottom
[18:55:28] <operhiem1> that it does, thank you!
[18:57:00] <operhiem1> Wow, this is more Javascript than I've worked with: so msgPane is now an object for the scroll handler?
[18:57:33] <ajpiano> no
[18:57:44] <ajpiano> var foo = $("#foo")
[18:57:49] <ajpiano> so you are referencing a jQuery object
[18:57:58] <ziggles> ajpiano: im sorry to bother you again, but is there anyway u could give me some direction on how i'm supposed to be using each?
[18:58:06] <ajpiano> since jQuery objects are chainable,it means that every jquery method also returns a jQuery object
[18:58:21] <operhiem1> so the assignment is for the messages pane, and the registration of the scroll handler is irrelevant to what's returned?
[18:58:23] <ziggles> ajpiano: is my json object not formatted correctly?  Maybe that's it.  http://pastie.org/private/ctwe6ersbkgpp5iiynjkq
[18:58:24] <ajpiano> so var foo = $("#foo").click(function() {});
[18:58:32] <operhiem1> okay
[18:58:54] <operhiem1> And why did you write it that way?
[19:00:26] <ajpiano> ziggles: $.each(data, function(i,def) {    $.each(def.arrayified_character_list, function(j, character ) {  //...//    });             })
[19:00:43] <ajpiano> operhiem1: because every time that you do $("#ajQuerySelection") it is a DOM query
[19:00:56] <ajpiano> which is a fundamentally expensive operation that you should limit doing to when you actually need to get the elements
[19:00:56] <operhiem1> Ah, saving on calls for the cost of memory.
[19:01:09] <ajpiano> yep :)
[19:01:28] <ajpiano> by the same logic, you could probably remove the .height() call from inside of the atBottom check
[19:01:53] <ajpiano> so that you don't get the container height on every scroll, which is, again, a perf sink for no reason, cause the container's height isn't changing
[19:02:51] <ajpiano> ziggles: in jQuery.each, the index and the item are passed as arguments to the iterator function, so the first step where you do var foo = collection[index] isn't necessary anymore
[19:03:33] <ziggles> ajpiano: i somewhat see that now... it hink what threw me was that in the link you gave me showing .each the person had been demonstrating by ONLY passing the index...
[19:03:43] <ziggles> he was alerting out numbers i think after counting an array...
[19:03:51] <ajpiano> ah, sorry bout that
[19:03:55] <ajpiano> ?jQuery.each
[19:03:55] <bot-t> jQuery.each(collection, callback): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[19:04:37] <BinaryKitten> heh .each is my nightmare
[19:04:41] <ziggles> ajpiano: no no, not ur fault at all...   i just was confused because i googled and saw people using index, item and thought it didnt apply to me
[19:05:02] <ziggles> ajpiano: let me try out the example you gave me.
[19:08:08] <ziggles> ajpiano: on this line: $.each(def.arrayified_character_list, function(j, character)   it results in an error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[19:08:35] <ajpiano> hum you know what i could just make a live demo and everyone's life easier, give me one sec
[19:09:07] <BinaryKitten> heh
[19:10:11] <BinaryKitten> ajpiano want to see some rather nasty code?
[19:10:40] <ajpiano> ziggles yeah that was my mistake, misread the json
[19:12:38] <ajpiano> ziggles http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/TDFhK/
[19:14:04] <BinaryKitten> ajpiano have a laugh and cringe by reading this: http://jsbin.com/ofubop/edit
[19:14:22] <ajpiano> sweet jebus
[19:14:50] <BinaryKitten> heh
[19:15:08] <BinaryKitten> i particularly like the if (index >= viewCount) bit
[19:15:11] <ziggles> ajpiano:  thank you! checking it out.
[19:15:45] <BinaryKitten> ajpiano small q you might be able to answer..
[19:15:54] <BinaryKitten> if you create an element without appending it to the dom
[19:16:02] <BinaryKitten> and append items to it from the dom..
[19:16:11] <BinaryKitten> do they get removed from the dom?
[19:16:36] <ajpiano> i do beielve so
[19:17:08] <BinaryKitten> it's a remove though rather than a detachment.. so you would lose bound events?
[19:17:46] <ajpiano> if you're doing $("#foo").appendTo( offDomElemReference) i don't *think* you'd lose handlers
[19:18:10] <BinaryKitten> better to be safe and detach 1st?
[19:18:22] <brylie_> I would like to create a drag and drop canvas where I can insert an item based on the mouse position. How can I use jQuery to insert an element via a right click menu?
[19:19:01] <ajpiano> BinaryKitten: not sure, just test first :)
[19:19:07] <BinaryKitten> ok..
[19:19:28] <BinaryKitten> tying to best fix that mess

[19:21:11] * BinaryKitten loves group/groupEnd
[19:21:41] <ziggles>  here's a follow up question... In the event i do something like this: http://pastie.org/2224998   does doing the initial look up and assigning it to a var help with performance at all?
[19:22:04] <ziggles> LOL!  ftj start image is the bomb
[19:22:10] <ajpiano> yes.. but you can also chain all three of those
[19:22:15] <ajpiano> so it's the same savings
[19:22:23] <ajpiano> also
[19:22:25] <ajpiano> that's me at the age of 3
[19:22:26] <ajpiano> :D
[19:22:31] <BinaryKitten> ziggles in this case there is not much difference. but make sure you use the var keyword
[19:22:45] <BinaryKitten> otherwise you could be creating an unwanted global var
[19:23:01] <ziggles> OH ok.  so var gets scoped and cleaned up when it's done i assume
[19:23:22] <BinaryKitten> var something; = local scope
[19:23:56] <BinaryKitten> otherwise it goes up the parent tree to find the 1st instance of it
[19:23:59] <ziggles> ajpiano: i thought ur childhood hair was awesome... But if you are adamjsontag.com then it's definitely MORE awesome now.
[19:24:12] <ajpiano> haha yeah it's been a journey
[19:24:13] <BinaryKitten> if it hit's window, and not found it by then; it will create it at the window scope
[19:24:15] <ziggles> BinaryKitten: got it.
[19:25:11] <BinaryKitten> ziggles good thing about var keyword is tht it's comma delimeted.. var item1=1,item2=2, etc=etc;
[19:25:30] <ziggles> ajpiano: the most gangster js company? LoL... damn.  cursive and everything!
[19:25:41] <ziggles> http://bocoup.com/ check source on this page. that's awesome
[19:25:49] <ajpiano> hahah yeah that be us
[19:26:23] <ziggles> BinaryKitten: ahhh i see.  I've seen coffeescript compiled js come out with all definitions on top like that.  kind of nice so you know everything that's going on right up front.
[19:26:56] <BinaryKitten> it's also a lint recommendation for JS
[19:28:44] <ziggles> BinaryKitten: ajpiano great talking with you guys... i need to go eat but thank you again to both of you guys.
[19:28:50] * BinaryKitten wonders how long it is before bocoup.com starts using articles and sections

[19:33:03] <vladikoff> hey BinaryKitten
[19:33:24] <BinaryKitten> hey
[19:34:28] <Mkop> at http://api.jquery.com/offset/, someone posted a comment, "If I apply offset() twice the second time the element is offset relative to its old position and not relative to the document. Is that normal?"
[19:34:36] <Mkop> does anyone know of a workaround for this issue?
[19:38:23] <coldhead> that sounds like a bug
[19:39:55] <Mkop> omg, this is driving me crazy. commenting/uncommenting lines 226/227 changes  the behavior of line 225
[19:40:05] <Mkop> how is that even possible?
[19:40:35] <Mkop> I think it's something to do with asynchronous nature of console.log
[19:41:04] <Chibby_> does anyone know if there's a way to check if a checkbox is checked or not?
[19:41:27] <coldhead> ?w heisenbug @ Mkop
[19:41:29] <bot-t> Mkop, Unusual software bug - Unusual software bugs are a class of software bugs that are considered exceptionally difficult to understand and repair. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unusual_software_bug
[19:42:00] <Mkop> heisenbug is a good word.
[19:44:10] <Mkop> a coworker once told me about a heisenbug he had where the System.out.println() call changed the timing of the code enough for a password generation function to have enough entropy or something. without it, it occasionally failed randomly
[19:44:34] <coldhead> programming is hard :(
[19:44:58] <wookiehangover> coldhead knows
[19:46:13] <Chibby_> lol, Schrödinbug, what nonsense!
[19:46:31] <Mkop> Shroedinger's bug?
[19:46:35] <BinaryKitten> yep.
[19:46:47] <BinaryKitten> the actual bug changes upon inspection
[19:46:49] <Mkop> can't ever know if it's alive or dead
[19:47:17] <Mkop> in a moment I will push my code to bitbucket and unleash a heisenbug finding competition
[19:47:37] <Chibby_> no, that was something else BinaryKitten
[19:47:59] <Chibby_> Schrödinbug is trying to claim that a bug can manifest itself simply by looking at the source code
[19:48:09] <BinaryKitten> ah
[19:48:49] * BinaryKitten heads to sleep
[19:49:41] <Mkop> https://bitbucket.org/mkopinsky/bananagrams/src/57dbd86755a8/js/bananagrams.js
[19:50:45] <Mkop> there are two bugs I'm hunting right now: 1) .offset() doesn't seem to be working quite right on line 227. 2) (the heisenbug) - line 225 has different output based on whether lines 226-227 are commented or not
[19:52:17] <Mkop> http://mkopinsky.aishdas.org/bananagrams/ if you want a live copy
[19:58:58] <Chibby_> ah i worked it out: .is(':checked')
[20:03:05] <delinquentme> any ideas on how i might test for this ??  http://pastie.org/2225094
[20:03:47] <Mkop> delinquentme: huh?
[20:04:12] <Mkop> explain?
[20:05:07] <delinquentme> Mkop, so i check the color on the class
[20:05:18] <delinquentme> it returns with that rgb string on line 2
[20:05:32] <delinquentme> so i want to run a test to see if that selector is colored that color
[20:05:37] <Mkop> there is no line 2.... did you send the right link?
[20:06:25] <delinquentme> updated
[20:06:35] <delinquentme> apparently pastie doesnt like '>>>'
[20:06:40] <delinquentme> wow ..
[20:06:41] <delinquentme> or that
[20:06:42] <Mkop> new link?
[20:07:22] <delinquentme> http://pastebin.com/1zFMa0aY
[20:07:26] <delinquentme> yeah that pastie failed
[20:08:13] <Mkop> do you have a live example?
[20:08:13] <delinquentme> nm got it!
[20:08:16] <Mkop> try without the "s
[20:08:19] <delinquentme> yeahh
[20:08:26] <delinquentme> just one set of quotes << nub mistake
[20:08:31] <Mkop> the "s are added by the console probably
[20:09:04] <delinquentme> yeahhh
[20:09:35] <Mkop> out of curiosity - why are you dynamically doing color checking?
[20:10:22] <Mkop> sounds like a) it's easily breakable (what if the color is '#ff0000'?), and b) possibly indicative of weird/bad design
[20:12:36] <Mkop> delinquentme: ^^
[20:13:06] <delinquentme> yeahhhh i was wondering about browser presentations of the color
[20:16:13] <zivester> how does one animate to a specific background color and then back to the original color? must I first figure out what the background of the element is?
[20:16:40] <dualcore> zivester: with the .animate function but you need to us the jquery ui
[20:16:46] <dualcore> use*
[20:17:06] <dualcore> zivester: http://jqueryui.com/demos/animate/
[20:19:32] <DeathRayDragonLu> okay, i can't beleeeeeve it, but i actually fired up adium because i couldn't find the damanswer online
[20:19:55] <DeathRayDragonLu> regarding .delegate — i get it, i get it
[20:20:14] <zivester> i have o.animate( { backgroundColor: '#00FF82' }, 500).animate( { backgroundColor: what_should_this_value_be? }, 500);
[20:20:19] <DeathRayDragonLu> it's performant over multiple bindings to many elements
[20:20:51] <DeathRayDragonLu> but, what's better if you have many elements of different kinds that do different things with differnet events?
[20:21:08] <DeathRayDragonLu> just use .bind (or .click or .whatever) ?
[20:21:21] <DeathRayDragonLu> or can i use .delegation with multiple selectors?
[20:21:23] <DeathRayDragonLu> something like:
[20:21:38] <dualcore> zivester: with hex such as #000000 or rgb or an html color value
[20:22:25] <DeathRayDragonLu> $("#parentEl").delegate("li, .prev, .next, #someOtherSelector", "click", function() { … });
[20:22:49] <DeathRayDragonLu> and then use $(event.target).closest() to find out which element has been clicked...
[20:22:54] <DeathRayDragonLu> That's redundant, yes?
[20:23:03] <DeathRayDragonLu> Since delegate is already doing that?
[20:25:24] <dualcore> DeathRayDragonLu: i can't help you with that but you may want to setup an example of what you're trying to do on http://jsfiddle.net to show the others and help assist in getting an answer
[20:25:56] <DeathRayDragonLu> yeah, yeah… i guess i can go to that trouble… :p
[20:26:32] <dualcore> you can just wait for someone to respond but it wouldn't hurt in the mean time
[20:26:53] <DeathRayDragonLu> I think the event delegation in this chat room is bubbling slowly… :p
[20:30:00] <dualcore> DeathRayDragonLu: can you re-explain what you're trying to do overall?  i'm having trouble following.  i also have not used .delegate before though but i can take a look
[20:31:06] <DeathRayDragonLu> s'okay — i'm using jsfiddle
[20:31:13] <DeathRayDragonLu> i think it might be easier to explain
[20:32:11] <Mazenwrq> hi
[20:33:06] <Mazenwrq> can any one help me?
[20:44:45] <Mkop> Mazenwrq: if you ask a question, maybe we can help you.
[20:50:13] <xsamurai> any reason why this http://jsfiddle.net/wg6Hk/ would not work in my  code but work fine on jsfiddle
[20:50:56] <xsamurai> *works
[20:58:19] <Mkop> xsamurai: why are you using id="2"? why not a meaningful name?
[21:10:03] <DeathRayDragonLu> okay dualcore…still around? http://jsfiddle.net/bfhDp/23/
[21:10:30] <DeathRayDragonLu> I figure correct usage of $.delegate is important enough to go to the trouble of building out this working example.
[21:10:40] <DeathRayDragonLu> Try clicking on the different links...
[21:10:47] <DeathRayDragonLu> I mean elements.
[21:10:48] <ajpiano> Marakxum
[21:10:51] <ajpiano> whoops
[21:11:07] <ajpiano> DeathRayDragonLu: you could do a lot of things
[21:11:13] <DeathRayDragonLu> hey ajpiano
[21:11:14] <ajpiano> 1) you could have an object to do the look ups on
[21:11:22] <ajpiano> 2) you could toggle a simple class on the elements
[21:11:29] <ajpiano> and just have css that corresponds to elem.someClass
[21:11:36] <ajpiano> and so it gets the properties you want
[21:11:41] <DeathRayDragonLu> oh it's not the animation i'm actually concerned about
[21:11:44] <ajpiano> without having to keep any style information in your thing
[21:11:52] <DeathRayDragonLu> ignore the properties — that's just illustrative
[21:12:15] <DeathRayDragonLu> I'm more concerned about whether I should be using .bind or .delegation in cases like this
[21:12:15] <ajpiano> why are you so concerned about using delegate only once
[21:13:10] <DeathRayDragonLu> Because it seems more efficient — when I looked under the surface using firebug, it attaches multiple events if I use multiple delegate calls.
[21:13:18] <DeathRayDragonLu> Not sure I'm making sense.
[21:13:34] <ajpiano> i think you're seeing a bottleneck where there isn't one
[21:13:34] <DeathRayDragonLu> This is an edge case, but I think it illustrates what I'm trying to understand.
[21:13:41] <systemfault> You're not :/
[21:13:45] <ajpiano> in any case i am showing a way to reduce the code a bit
[21:13:53] <systemfault> You should have a delegate per element :/
[21:13:59] <ajpiano> but yeah
[21:14:07] <DeathRayDragonLu> That's my question, right there systemfault
[21:14:14] <ajpiano> trying to reduce the "number of functions" by having a gigantic function that switches case and blah blah blah
[21:14:18] <ajpiano> in the name of "efficiency" is kind of backwards
[21:14:27] <DeathRayDragonLu> Why not just use .bind then?
[21:14:40] <DeathRayDragonLu> sorry, that was to system, not you ajpiano
[21:14:43] <DeathRayDragonLu> I get your point
[21:14:57] <DeathRayDragonLu> so using case doesn't help
[21:15:00] <systemfault> DeathRayDragonLu: event delegatation is usually useful in 2 cases
[21:15:05] <DeathRayDragonLu> Right
[21:15:09] <DeathRayDragonLu> I know those two cases.
[21:15:15] <DeathRayDragonLu> For new elements.
[21:15:17] <systemfault> Ah ok :P
[21:15:25] <ajpiano> why not use bind? because you're still only binding one event, instead of N events per thing int he container
[21:15:29] <systemfault> 1) For sets of same elements.
[21:15:30] <DeathRayDragonLu> And for multiple elements, such as huge lists or table td's.
[21:15:45] <systemfault> 2) When the content of some element changes all the time.
[21:15:46] <DeathRayDragonLu> yup
[21:15:50] <DeathRayDragonLu> right
[21:16:05] <DeathRayDragonLu> So I realize I'm *really* digging here, ha.
[21:16:08] <DeathRayDragonLu> But...
[21:16:41] <DeathRayDragonLu> In normal usage, where you're just adding, say, click events to random things around the page.
[21:16:52] <DeathRayDragonLu> (Not multiples of lists or tds)
[21:17:10] <DeathRayDragonLu> and where the page isn't going to change a lot (such as adding and destroying elements)
[21:17:25] <DeathRayDragonLu> What's more effecient? .delegate or .bind?
[21:17:34] <DeathRayDragonLu> *efficient
[21:17:36] <systemfault> bind.
[21:17:43] <DeathRayDragonLu> Okay, awesome.
[21:17:49] <DeathRayDragonLu> I wondered such.
[21:18:07] <ajpiano> marginally
[21:18:13] <DeathRayDragonLu> Exactly.
[21:18:13] <systemfault> Right
[21:18:27] <DeathRayDragonLu> It hadn't occurred to me until today, because…well…delegate is such a tricky thing to get anyway.
[21:18:48] <DeathRayDragonLu> So I once used this technique (the jsfiddle one I posted) on a project I did...
[21:18:53] <DeathRayDragonLu> thinking it was best...
[21:18:58] <systemfault> DeathRayDragonLu: If you understand bubbling, event delegation is fairly easy to understand
[21:19:02] <DeathRayDragonLu> when the site was simple enough to just go with .bind :p
[21:19:29] <DeathRayDragonLu> Yes, it's easy to understand, but not necessarily what's more efficient.
[21:19:45] <DeathRayDragonLu> I still don't get *why* .bind is more efficient, but I believe you, ha.
[21:19:54] <DeathRayDragonLu> Because it's what I suspect.
[21:20:00] <DeathRayDragonLu> *suspected already.
[21:20:01] <systemfault> DeathRayDragonLu: Because there's no bubbling
[21:20:03] <ajpiano> cause you don't have to quote unquote "wait" for the event bubbling to happen
[21:20:09] <DeathRayDragonLu> ah
[21:20:11] <DeathRayDragonLu> okay
[21:20:14] <DeathRayDragonLu> simple enough
[21:20:15] <DeathRayDragonLu> ha
[21:20:43] <ajpiano> DeathRayDragonLu: i feel like in the switch case example thing you had
[21:20:46] <systemfault> That's why with delegate, you should always add a context when possible.
[21:20:47] <ajpiano> even though it wasn't switch case...
[21:20:53] <DeathRayDragonLu> right
[21:20:54] <systemfault> (Or .live)
[21:20:58] <DeathRayDragonLu> blegh
[21:20:58] <ajpiano> any MARGINAL perf boost you pick up by binding fewer handlers at the outset
[21:20:58] <DeathRayDragonLu> ha
[21:21:15] <DeathRayDragonLu> .live ftw!
[21:21:17] <ajpiano> is probably nullified by checking e.target.nodeName 6 times per handler on any one of those 6 elements
[21:21:25] <DeathRayDragonLu> right
[21:21:25] <systemfault> DeathRayDragonLu: It's the same thing :P
[21:21:32] <DeathRayDragonLu> ahhhh
[21:21:34] <systemfault> .live .delegate..
[21:21:34] <DeathRayDragonLu> ha ha ha ha ha
[21:21:43] <DeathRayDragonLu> NOT
[21:22:01] <ajpiano> DeathRayDragonLu live is event delegation on the document with a more "magic" api
[21:22:09] <DeathRayDragonLu> yeah
[21:22:13] <systemfault> ajpiano: You can specify a context
[21:22:19] <ajpiano> i'm well aware
[21:22:19] <systemfault> AFAIK.
[21:22:20] <ajpiano> :p
[21:22:23] <systemfault> :)
[21:22:32] <DeathRayDragonLu> except less performant and does't … uh … whatjamacallit
[21:22:44] <ajpiano> oh FYI DeathRayDragonLu if you like doing this style of binding
[21:22:46] <DeathRayDragonLu> chain
[21:22:48] <ajpiano> you should checkout Backbone :p
[21:22:56] <systemfault> DeathRayDragonLu: Only the initialization is less performant AFAIK
[21:23:04] <DeathRayDragonLu> i've heard of it and have yet to take a full look
[21:23:12] <systemfault> DeathRayDragonLu: But who cares about the performance of something that is executed _once_
[21:23:19] <ajpiano> it lets you write like, the delegated handlers in the style you want
[21:23:20] <DeathRayDragonLu> zactly
[21:24:05] <DeathRayDragonLu> btw, ajpiano — funny thing — i was just looking at bocoup loft pics at alman's site
[21:24:11] <DeathRayDragonLu> saw one w/ you
[21:24:11] <ajpiano> http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#View-extend
[21:24:18] <DeathRayDragonLu> how's that for scary small world
[21:24:22] <ajpiano> haha yes , i work there :p
[21:24:25] <DeathRayDragonLu> i work right around the corner from you
[21:24:29] <ajpiano> oh no way
[21:24:33] <DeathRayDragonLu> on farnsworth
[21:24:44] <DeathRayDragonLu> ifactory
[21:24:48] <DeathRayDragonLu> .com
[21:24:55] <ajpiano> built in boston
[21:24:58] <ajpiano> wutt
[21:24:59] <ajpiano> :p
[21:25:01] <DeathRayDragonLu> lol
[21:25:06] <ajpiano> i live in new york though
[21:25:15] <ajpiano> so i don't even know where farnsworth is
[21:25:23] <DeathRayDragonLu> i gotta wrap my mind around this backbone thing
[21:25:35] <DeathRayDragonLu> lol it's literally right around the corner from you
[21:25:38] <DeathRayDragonLu> you know metro?
[21:25:44] <DeathRayDragonLu> it's that side street
[21:25:49] <ajpiano> oh haha yeah
[21:26:03] <DeathRayDragonLu> worst place to eat on el planet
[21:26:13] <DeathRayDragonLu> (guilty)
[21:26:16] <ajpiano> haha i'm obsessed with SPORTELLO
[21:26:22] <DeathRayDragonLu> yup yum
[21:26:30] <ajpiano> i don't even see the point of eating anywhere else when i'm in boston
[21:26:36] <DeathRayDragonLu> lol
[21:26:52] <systemfault> ajpiano: Do you use backbone?
[21:26:58] <ajpiano> systemfault: yea
[21:27:08] <systemfault> ajpiano: Does it work well for you?
[21:27:10] <DeathRayDragonLu> hey — who built backbone?
[21:27:11] <delinquentme> so im looking to just run a function
[21:27:15] <delinquentme> not with a $(this)
[21:27:18] <ajpiano> systemfault: yeah, i really like it
[21:27:21] <delinquentme> or any kind of selector
[21:27:28] <delinquentme> just take code within the function .. and run it
[21:27:48] <delinquentme> http://pastebin.com/1SYuXbG8 << this is the code
[21:27:51] <ajpiano> it's nice to just have a consistent pattern and strategy for implementing client side stuff and orienting it around the actual data you're presenting, instead of just like slapping a bunch of jQuery onto a page
[21:27:52] <ajpiano> :p
[21:27:59] <delinquentme> im not sure why parsability or sovren_insights isnt running
[21:28:02] <ajpiano> DeathRayDragonLu, jeremy ashkenas
[21:28:09] <DeathRayDragonLu> cool
[21:28:14] <DeathRayDragonLu> ness
[21:28:15] <ajpiano> delinquentme: uh, get rid of the .d
[21:28:19] <ajpiano> the period
[21:28:33] <ajpiano> you don't call a function by putting a period in front of it... unless you're like, chaining jquery methods
[21:28:55] <systemfault> ajpiano: I'll check it :)
[21:29:19] <ajpiano> yeah take it for a spin :)
[21:29:31] <delinquentme> being told that its no defined
[21:29:51] <ajpiano> well maybe the functions are not globally available
[21:30:07] <ajpiano> being as i'm not your DOM they are certainly undefined to me, and they are undefined in this snippet
[21:30:26] <DeathRayDragonLu> hey random side note about possible (jQuery?) shims and -whatzit-transform css...
[21:30:52] <DeathRayDragonLu> i know there's a "transformie" shim out there
[21:30:54] <DeathRayDragonLu> but it's like
[21:31:00] <DeathRayDragonLu> so not
[21:31:06] <DeathRayDragonLu> fully loaded
[21:31:16] <ajpiano> lol
[21:31:39] <DeathRayDragonLu> Has anybody thought through if it would even be *possible* to mimic transition?
[21:31:51] <DeathRayDragonLu> transition is pretty powerful
[21:31:58] <DeathRayDragonLu> changing colors and all that jazz
[21:32:25] <DeathRayDragonLu> -ms-transition: boo
[21:32:26] <ajpiano> have you seen https://github.com/rpflorence/CSSAnimation
[21:32:38] <ajpiano> not quite the same thing, but probably a good place to build it into if you're insane enough to try
[21:32:38] <ajpiano> lol
[21:32:43] <DeathRayDragonLu> ah, rad
[21:32:49] <DeathRayDragonLu> i am insane
[21:33:01] <DeathRayDragonLu> but not as insane as you bocoup types :p
[21:33:10] <DeathRayDragonLu> frawnch
[21:33:15] <ajpiano> haha well i certainly wouldn't ;p
[21:33:40] <DeathRayDragonLu> i actually started githubbing something out, but I'd be too embarrassed to show it at this point
[21:33:51] <DeathRayDragonLu> maybe if i get it more polished i'll come back and mention it again
[21:34:03] <ajpiano> ha
[21:34:06] <ajpiano> yea
[21:34:14] <ajpiano> have you seen the work on jQuery.color
[21:34:22] <DeathRayDragonLu> ah rad!
[21:34:24] <DeathRayDragonLu> no!
[21:34:26] <DeathRayDragonLu> where?
[21:34:28] <ajpiano> has some pretty flexible stuff that works in old IEs
[21:34:43] <ajpiano> http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/31/jquery-color-v2-beta-1-released/
[21:34:59] <DeathRayDragonLu> sweet
[21:35:15] <DeathRayDragonLu> hsla!
[21:35:18] <systemfault> ajpiano: Do you think jQuery.template is usable now? I mean.. for real projects.
[21:35:26] <ajpiano> systemfault: no
[21:35:46] <ajpiano> the only thing constant about it is that it is in flux
[21:35:47] <systemfault> Is there something I could use instead?
[21:35:50] <DeathRayDragonLu> lol
[21:35:51] <systemfault> Ah :/
[21:35:52] <ajpiano> yeah
[21:35:57] <DeathRayDragonLu> backbone
[21:35:58] <ajpiano> i've been using handlebars on projects recently
[21:35:59] <DeathRayDragonLu> lol
[21:36:07] <ajpiano> http://handlebarsjs.com
[21:36:22] <DeathRayDragonLu> Oops! Google Chrome could not find handlebarsjs.com
[21:36:23] <ajpiano> http://www.handlebarsjs.com
[21:36:33] <ajpiano> lol good job strob
[21:36:34] <ajpiano> :p
[21:36:54] <ajpiano> DeathRayDragonLu backbone is templating-engine-agnostic :)
[21:37:18] <systemfault> Checking ;)
[21:37:32] <DeathRayDragonLu> i c i c
[21:37:43] <danieliser> i have a sortable/droppable list.. It saves the order to dB on update, but when i drag a draggable to it the update function triggers but doesnt pass on the new item or its position
[21:37:44] <DeathRayDragonLu> does one use it in concert w/ … say … node.js ?
[21:37:45] <ajpiano> systemfault: it's kind of like mustache templates but like
[21:37:50] <ajpiano> the api is way improved
[21:38:08] <ajpiano> DeathRayDragonLu: one can use it with node,
[21:38:14] <DeathRayDragonLu> yar
[21:38:19] <ajpiano> but it was built originally for client side
[21:38:25] <DeathRayDragonLu> there's this whole are there i'm way behind on
[21:39:32] <DeathRayDragonLu> well #folks
[21:39:41] <DeathRayDragonLu> gotta go rest
[21:39:46] <ajpiano> gnite
[21:39:47] <systemfault> gn :)
[21:39:53] <DeathRayDragonLu> thx for el help
[21:40:13] <systemfault> Have le good night
[21:40:17] <DeathRayDragonLu> ha
[21:40:22] <DeathRayDragonLu> thumbs up
[21:40:52] <systemfault> ajpiano: What do you think of require.js? I've use YUI3 in the past which has a similar loader
[21:41:41] <ajpiano> i enjoyed using it
[21:41:51] <ajpiano> would use again
[21:42:04] <ajpiano> i like the way it forces you to organise stuff
[21:42:11] <ajpiano> and handle text dependencies as wel
[21:42:51] <ajpiano> systemfault: basically i had a project at work where i was like, ok , i'm gonna learn backbone and require
[21:42:55] <systemfault> Good, because I'll be on a new project at work soon and I want to know what should be used :)
[21:42:55] <ajpiano> and i did,
[21:43:09] <ajpiano> and i am well off for the wear !
[21:44:36] <systemfault> :)
[21:46:19] <systemfault> Haha, I love this http://i.imgur.com/09d2m.jpg
[21:46:25] <danieliser> how can i serialize the sort order of a sortable when dropping a draggable from another list?
[21:46:41] <danieliser> i have to add it then resort to make it save..
[21:46:52] <ajpiano> systemfault: hahahaha
[21:47:26] <xDROPx> hahaha
[21:47:44] <zivester> how does one copy all the data() from one element to another... (or have it reference the other data)?
[21:48:08] <danieliser> when i drop a new item on it it triggers the update function but serialzing the sortable doesnt pick up the newly added item.
[21:48:24] <xDROPx> zivester: $(element).clone()
[21:48:37] <ajpiano> danieliser, you can just write some method that iterates over the children of the container and creates a strucutre you can use
[21:48:47] <ajpiano> zivester $("#foo").data(  $("#bar").data() ) ;
[21:49:15] <zivester> ajpiano: ah tx
[21:49:33] <danieliser> ajpiano: so manually serialize it? is the dropped item not initialized in the sortable list when the update fires?
[21:50:02] <ajpiano> i'm not sure :/
[21:51:01] <pl0sh> I have a list of items with a class called delItem, then I have $(".delItem").live("click",delItem); but I just want to call the function just once, for the item selected, but it executes the function as many times as items..
[21:51:04] <pl0sh> any ideas?
[21:51:52] <ajpiano> hum, that sounds erroneous
[21:51:55] <ajpiano> got some live code
[21:51:56] <ajpiano> ?
[21:52:15] <pl0sh> let me see..
[21:53:32] <pl0sh> http://jsfiddle.net/uByzp/
[21:53:57] <ajpiano> can you put the html and such there so that it actually works and i can see it doing what you said
[21:55:01] <pl0sh> http://jsfiddle.net/uByzp/1/
[21:56:08] <systemfault> Works fine.
[21:56:11] <pl0sh> hmm, here works just fine :S
[21:56:11] <pl0sh> http://jsfiddle.net/uByzp/3/
[21:56:21] <pl0sh> then, it should be anything else..
[21:56:24] <pl0sh> thanks..
[21:56:29] <systemfault> :P
[21:56:32] <pl0sh> haha
[21:56:44] <ajpiano> href javascript is a mean old bastard
[21:56:49] <pl0sh> really?
[21:56:57] <ajpiano> he's probably trying to get the jqueries off his lawn
[21:56:59] <ajpiano> yea
[21:57:01] <pl0sh> do you recommend a simple # ?
[21:57:01] <ajpiano> it's badnews
[21:57:16] <pl0sh> or what's better?
[21:57:27] <ajpiano> personally if i have an <a> that i don't want it do anything but be useful in javascript
[21:57:31] <ajpiano> i use <a tabindex=0>
[21:57:41] <systemfault> ajpiano: You still get the cursor?
[21:57:42] <gf3> or <span>
[21:57:52] <pl0sh> alright
[21:58:00] <systemfault> span sucks semantically.
[21:58:05] <pl0sh> yup!
[21:58:14] <gf3> systemfault, so does <a>
[21:58:15] <pl0sh> a for the a's ;)
[21:58:24] <ajpiano> systemfault: no, you lose a bit of the default styling
[21:58:41] <ajpiano> but in a lot of those cases i find you aren't using text anyway, it's like an <a> that you're just using with a background image or whatnot
[21:58:46] <gf3> systemfault, <a> is for a semantic relationship between documents
[21:58:54] <systemfault> ajpiano: That's why I still use href="#" :( but use event.preventDefault();
[22:00:21] <pl0sh> gf3 you're right
[22:00:38] <gf3> I wonder if one could use a button that has been styled to look like a link
[22:00:43] <pl0sh> semantically speaking, in my case I should use a button..
[22:00:45] <ajpiano> gf3: tabindex is supported on <a> though
[22:00:56] <ajpiano> but button yeah, would be the best choice
[22:01:13] <systemfault> I often forget about the button tag
[22:01:22] <pl0sh> lol
[22:01:26] * gf3 pushes ajpiano's button
[22:01:46] <gf3> boop
[22:01:53] <ajpiano> chrome doesn't seem to mind <span tabindex=0> though lolz
[22:02:41] <ajpiano> beep bop
[22:02:47] <coldhead> i doubt you actually laughed out loud at that
[22:03:06] <gf3> coldhead, he did
[22:03:10] <gf3> I was there
[22:03:16] <ajpiano> you're right i continued i observing my monklike silence
[22:03:18] <coldhead> i sit corrected
[22:03:19] <ajpiano> YOU WEREN'T
[22:03:21] <ajpiano> YOU'RE NEVER THERE FOR ME
[22:03:27] <ajpiano> :'|
[22:03:31] <gf3> I WAS THAT ONE TIME
[22:03:45] <ajpiano> we'll always have that one time
[22:03:55] <gf3> mmm
[22:05:05] * gf3 takes coldhead back behind the middle school and gets him pregnant
[22:05:17] <systemfault> Eww
[22:05:25] <coldhead> brown love <3
[22:05:30] <pl0sh> btw, I solved the problem..
[22:05:35] <gf3> brown babies?
[22:05:36] <systemfault> pl0sh: Good :)
[22:05:38] <pl0sh> it wasn't of course something related to jquery :D
[22:05:42] <coldhead> israel palestine?
[22:05:53] <systemfault> Windows Linux?
[22:05:54] <gf3> too soon
[22:08:45] <systemfault> Hmm, I should go see the last Harry Potter
[22:08:46] <systemfault> :/
[22:08:58] <systemfault> I already know the ending though... Harry Wins.
[22:09:11] <gf3> rude
[22:09:26] <systemfault> I don't know... Just guessing
[22:09:37] <systemfault> I'd be surprised if he died.
[22:39:56] <danieliser> i want to add a popup box with a text field during the drop function of a droppable. i want to use this similar to a confirm box. It needs to interupt the drop function until they hit ok
[22:40:12] <danieliser> then use the value they submitted in the drop ajax call
[22:47:01] <Jester831> hmmm, what hook runs during the post edit init
[22:47:47] <Jester831> whoops
[22:56:29] <danieliser> i want to add a popup box with a text field during the drop function of a droppable. i want to use this similar to a confirm box. It needs to interupt the drop function until they hit ok
[22:58:42] <Chibby_> can't you run it with drop: function(event, ui) { ... }
[22:59:08] <Chibby_> from the events tab here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/
[23:08:19] <foxhoundz> is the .html() method an alias for innerHTML property?
[23:08:41] <Cork[home]> foxhoundz: not exactly, but mostly
[23:08:57] <Cork[home]> it does some saftly checks, and prevents some memory leaks
[23:09:08] <Cork[home]> it also supports adding dom objects
[23:10:49] <systemfault> afaik, it uses innerHTML when possible, if not it reverts to the documentFragment method.
[23:11:55] <foxhoundz> I see
[23:11:58] <foxhoundz> thanks for the info
[23:13:58] <varsen> anyone around?
[23:14:30] <systemfault> No, all dead :(
[23:15:21] <Shazer2> i'm here
[23:15:26] <Shazer2> slowly becoming the next mark zuckerberg
[23:15:34] <danieliser> Chibby_: thats where im wanting it.. i have an ajax call there but before i run that i want to get text from the user.
[23:15:53] <dr0id> Shazer2: can you include me ?
[23:16:31] <danieliser> Shazer is your project public?
[23:16:46] <systemfault> Shazer2: Why would you want to be that asshole?
[23:16:46] <Chibby_> danieliser: can't you just run the alert before the ajax call in that same function?
[23:16:54] <systemfault> Shazer2: I'd just take his money :P
[23:17:20] <danieliser> yea but i need the box to include a text box and require the user to type something..
[23:17:47] <danieliser> confirm is yes/no and alert is an ok.. neither offers a form field
[23:17:55] <systemfault> Then make one.
[23:18:12] <danieliser> talking to me?
[23:18:15] <systemfault> Yeah
[23:18:25] <varsen> I have a user interface that i want to build with two two rows of tabs   one set of tabs on the bottem and one on the top.   ---   I will mouseover the tabs and they will have descriptions
[23:18:48] <danieliser> i can easily make a modal but how can i make it interupt the function until the form is filled?
[23:18:59] <webBuilder> I have to question friend, the first one is I have jQuery on the client side that receives xml file but if the xml is empy or null it should trigger some action, how do I tell jQuery when xml is empy ?
[23:19:26] <webBuilder> <databable/> it means is empty for jqery ?
[23:19:29] <systemfault> danieliser: You don't, when you would press on "ok/send/whatever", it should call a callback
[23:19:43] <systemfault> danieliser: And in that callback, you would start the ajax transaction
[23:19:44] <varsen> the issue is i want to use jqueyUI but i don;t know how to seperate the function of the tab() function
[23:19:47] <Shazer2> dr0id: include you in?
[23:19:52] <Shazer2> danieliser: sort of
[23:20:06] <Shazer2> systemfault: he is inspirational/you watched the social network and got the wrong impression
[23:20:21] <systemfault> Shazer2: That he's a fucker?
[23:20:22] <dr0id> as a partner
[23:20:32] <danieliser> systemfault: this is in a function attatched to the drop event on a droppable
[23:20:39] <systemfault> Shazer2: A good programmer without ethic?
[23:20:53] <Shazer2> systemfault: umad 500 million users? and billions of dollars?
[23:20:54] <Shazer2> ok.
[23:20:56] <danieliser> Shazer2: info?
[23:20:57] <Shazer2> dr0id: PM.
[23:21:07] <Shazer2> danieliser: not atm
[23:21:09] <Shazer2> nothing big yet
[23:21:11] <ezrafree> can anyone tell me how to get the images in this content slider to automatically show the first one again without rewinding? http://jsfiddle.net/rSpeJ/

[23:22:01] <ezrafree> i imagine the "rewinding" is happening because of the scrollTo i am using...
[23:22:25] <ezrafree> is there any other way to just make it constantly loop? using the cycle plugin or something?
[23:22:25] <Shazer2> same shit
[23:25:52] <ezrafree> anyone have any thoughts on where i should even start? hehe
[23:36:28] <webBuilder> guys how can I can know in jQuery if an xml is empty ?
[23:36:47] <danieliser> try console.log()
[23:38:03] <webBuilder> danieliser, what do you mean
[23:38:11] <webBuilder> danieliser, are you talking to me ?
[23:39:23] <dr0id> yes
[23:39:53] <webBuilder> dr0id, can you guys please put the name of the people you guys talking to
[23:39:54] <danieliser> webBuilder: yea.. if your using firefox and firebug you can use console.log(whatever you want to see here).. it will output it to the browser logs
[23:40:05] <dr0id> LOL
[23:40:45] <webBuilder> danieliser, my goal is not to see the outcome on firefox, what I want is on the actual code if it gets empty xml to fire something
[23:40:50] <webBuilder> so how do you do that
[23:41:10] <Shazer2> with console.log webBuilder
[23:41:27] <danieliser> no he means in the code.. if its empty do this
[23:41:43] <webBuilder> danieliser, yep you got it :)
[23:43:15] <webBuilder> so everyone, no one did something that I'm trying to do ?
[23:44:29] <danieliser> try $(xml).find("response").children().size()
[23:44:40] <snover> ffs, don’t use size()
[23:45:09] <webBuilder> thank you danieliser I'll try it right now
[23:45:11] <danieliser> sorry try if($(xml).find("response").children().size()
[23:45:11] <danieliser> > 0){
[23:45:37] <webBuilder> danieliser, yep that what I was trying to do :)
[23:46:14] <danieliser> your xml will almost never be empty.. will have the xml container.. so this checks to see if there are any children of that container
[23:48:34] <gnarf> ?eval ~~(-2.3)

[23:48:46] <danieliser> webBuilder: that work for you?
[23:49:27] <JigABoot> I spent three nights on Neverland Ranch when I was 13!  Michael Jackson and I had so much fun cuddling in bed, climing trees, and riding gokarts.  One day when we were climbing a tree, he yanked down my shorts and underoos!  Then he proceeded to tap his hard 8 inch cock on my cheeks, spit in my crack, and slowly slip it in.  It hurt at first, but then I got this raging woody!
[23:50:48] <webBuilder> danieliser, your code is correct but is not getting to the else statment which mean 'response' is not accurate so I have to do the log thingy to see what I'm receiving from the server
[23:50:57] <webBuilder> danieliser, thank you so much for your help
[23:51:59] <danieliser> webBuilder: no worries.. what i gave checks if its not empty.. try == 0 to check if it is empty
[23:52:42] <webBuilder> danieliser, I did if >0 do this else do that
[23:52:52] <webBuilder> danieliser, the else do that part is not working
[23:53:08] <webBuilder> is not even getting inside the do that "else" part
[23:53:10] <webBuilder> strange
[23:56:46] <webBuilder> sorry computer froze
