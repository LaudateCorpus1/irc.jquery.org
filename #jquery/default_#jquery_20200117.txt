[17:58:51] <impliednude> I use an embedded iframe, I need to monitor the on click of a button. the iframe is from a different domain. any way to check if an element has been clicked?
[17:59:37] <impliednude> or no?
[18:41:10] <morenoh11> Cork: thanks for the raf fix. totally works now
[22:38:09] <blaster> hey guys I am trying to change the context of this in the foo() function to be that of the button (using $.proxy), but this doesn't seem to be working: https://jsfiddle.net/z2c8n1vd/
[22:38:23] <blaster> Context in the function remains as the window object.
[22:40:20] <blaster> "this"
[22:53:17] <shoky_> blaster:  it'd be  $.proxy(foo, this)()
[22:54:03] <shoky_> or just  foo.call(this)
