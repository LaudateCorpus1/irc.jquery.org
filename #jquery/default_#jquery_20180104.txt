[04:29:04] <sine0> when you addClass in jquery, and that class always exists will it skip it, or will it continue to stack/add the classes
[04:32:20] <thykka> sine0, it won't add a duplicate classname
[04:36:32] <sine0> ok thanks.
[05:13:18] <sine0> what am i doing wrong: if (b <= dayLimit && b !< 0){
[05:13:43] <moveax> console.log([b, dayLimit])
[05:14:12] <moveax> !< is used for "not smaller then 0"?
[05:14:18] <moveax> i would do >= 0
[05:14:28] <sine0> ok
[05:15:29] <thykka> !(b < 0) or b >= 0, not !<
[05:15:35] <moveax> iirc !< is not a valid operator, but i may be wrong
[05:15:55] <thykka> it's not
[05:16:07] <moveax> yeah, couldnt find it in the docs too
[05:16:41] <thykka> kinda curious how you ended up trying to use !<
[05:16:47] <moveax> ^
[05:17:21] <sine0> because im just having a go in all areas, Im not fully reading docs im just tryign to get things done, php,jquery,html,css,python
[05:17:43] <sine0> so my techniques and code is blasphemus so i apolagise
[05:18:15] <moveax> well at least the basics as variables, operators and control structures are important in every language
[05:23:48] <kvoz> Hi. I have a td with two divs. One div containing text, the other div containing a <select>. The select is hidden, and becomes visible when you click the text, and the text hides. And when you change the select, the select disappears and the text value changes to whatever you selected. My problem is that in some browsers, for some people, whenever you expand the select it just immediately closes again and you are unable to make a selection. I am unable to
[05:23:49] <kvoz> reproduce the problem on my computer so I am having a hard time figuring out what the problem is. Any ideas?
[05:24:27] <thykka> are you using an event to hide it?
[05:25:04] <thykka> i.e. 'select' or 'change'?
[05:25:48] <kvoz> change yes
[05:25:58] <thykka> did you ask those users which browser they're using?
[05:26:41] <kvoz> some are using chrome, some firefox. It works for me in both
[05:26:50] <thykka> operating system?
[05:27:01] <kvoz> Heavily varied. For me arch linux
[05:27:08] <thykka> do you have a link to the problematic page?
[05:27:24] <thykka> i could take a quick look with Browserstack
[05:27:28] <kvoz> Sorry no it's a company page
[05:27:40] <thykka> can you reproduce it in jsfiddle.net?
[05:28:24] <kvoz> I can try, give me a few minutes
[05:29:28] <thykka> I'm gonna go get some lunch, be back soon
[05:40:30] <kvoz> https://jsfiddle.net/czoat503/
[05:51:33] <MickeySoFine> Morning!
[05:52:23] <MickeySoFine> I'm trying to do PUT with $.ajax() but I'm finding that its not sending the payload as JSON
[05:52:49] <MickeySoFine> its setting the content type to Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
[05:53:07] <MickeySoFine> any way I can just get it to post as JSON?
[05:53:38] <MickeySoFine> I tried setting the contentType to application/json but that then causes the data to be passed as a query string
[05:59:37] <sine0> how can I add aria-required="true"
[06:00:05] <sine0> what are they called elements or something
[06:01:21] <sine0> selectors.
[06:32:29] <thykka> attributes?
[06:32:43] <thykka> $('.thing').attr('aria-required', 'true')
[06:43:16] <sine0> thanks thykka
[06:43:51] <sine0> also I have .blur set, you suggested on change which works, but also how can I make it load when the page loads ?
[06:46:12] <sine0> $('#g_type').trigger('blur');
[06:46:12] <sine0> ?
[06:47:32] <thykka> .blur sounds like a class selector.. what exactly are you attempting to do?
[06:51:54] <sine0> I have used on('change' function
[06:52:14] <sine0> I thought I cold trigger .blur()
[07:17:50] <sine0> I have conditions where a text input needs abc. when it has abc another field appears. however when I use jQuery to val("abc") it does not 'trigger' it and have the desired affect
[07:18:07] <sine0> If i manually write it, it works.
[07:23:36] <pastebin> http://jsfiddle.net/7kjjphc2/
[07:24:09] <pastebin> Not sure what im doing wrong. If i select Radio, it disables the correct one - but if i afterwards press i.e 24V, it removes all the other ones that where previously disabled.
[07:25:24] <sine0> i found my solution: jQuery('#input_46_6').val("abc").change();
[07:33:44] <pastebin> Anyone that knows what im doing wrong here?
[07:38:36] <thykka> pastebin, can you elaborate?
[07:38:45] <pastebin> Certainly
[07:38:53] <pastebin> First step you select Radio or IWC
[07:39:40] <pastebin> Say you select Radio, that removes "IWC" option under "Monteringskit" and also "1/2" 80 meter IWC" so they get disabled
[07:39:47] <pastebin> So far, so good!
[07:40:12] <pastebin> Next, you want to decide the voltage that the sytem will run on, they should ONLY affect the bottom checkboxed under "Vinda".
[07:40:34] <pastebin> If you select 12V or 24V under "VÃ¤lj Volt", the previously disabled checkboxes, will now become enabled again.
[07:40:44] <pastebin> I hope i explained it clearly :D
[07:41:34] <thykka> well, yes, but why do your event handlers attach to *all* radio-type inputs?
[07:42:13] <pastebin> Because i'm super new to jquery and trying my way ;)
[07:42:23] <pastebin> input[type="radio"] i guess you mean that part?
[07:42:53] <thykka> yes, well.. when you press radio #4, all of these handlers execute, and they all re-evaluate the attributes based on .val() == n
[07:43:04] <thykka> and if val() !== n, it sets the attibute to false
[07:43:42] <thykka> also..
[07:43:49] <thykka> attributes don't generally have a "false" value
[07:44:08] <thykka> if you want to unset an attribute, it should be omitted
[07:44:19] <pastebin> input:radio[name="radio"] could i use that method then?
[07:44:22] <thykka> disabled="false" is still disabled
[07:44:26] <pastebin> Ah
[07:44:42] <thykka> use .removeAttr('disabled') instead
[07:45:48] <pastebin> wait, this jquery is brand new to me - gona try and see if i can get it to work!
[07:46:12] <thykka> also, i think the logic you're implementing here could be expressed a lot more clearly
[07:46:28] <pastebin> Oh? I'm just trying to find a simple way to set it all up.
[07:46:43] <pastebin> I'll have a basic section that will define the rest of the options.
[07:46:54] <thykka> "simple" should mean "as legible as possible"
[07:47:01] <pastebin> Yes
[07:48:12] <pastebin> Being brand new to jquery (js overall!) will probably mean it will be somewhat messy no matter what i do :)
[07:48:40] <thykka> yes, that's okay
[07:49:26] <pastebin> hmmm
[07:49:32] <pastebin> I think i got it to work with my code tho
[07:49:32] <thykka> instead of having value="1", value="2" etc., why not value="Radio", value="IWC" etc.? That way there's less mental mapping required
[07:49:38] <pastebin> yeah, i changed that :)
[07:50:30] <thykka> and since the event listeners are only relevant to particular radio buttons, why not restrict them to the relevant radio buttons?
[07:50:38] <pastebin> http://jsfiddle.net/7kjjphc2/1/
[07:50:43] <pastebin> Done!
[07:50:51] <thykka> yes, much better
[07:50:52] <pastebin> Not sure how to implement the .removeAttr('disabled') tho?
[07:51:20] <thykka> an if-clause would probably be fine
[07:52:05] <pastebin> thykka - i know how i would approach it in PHP, but JS is too new :D
[07:52:28] <thykka> if($(this).val() == "iwc") { $('input.radio').attr({'unchecked', 'unchecked'}); } else { $('input.radio').removeAttr('unchecked'); }
[07:53:00] <pastebin> ah, much better yes!
[07:53:36] <thykka> (this also saves one DOM selection compared to what you had)
[07:53:43] <thykka> ((marginally faster ;))
[07:53:58] <pastebin> Yeah, and a bit tidier code overall ;)
[07:54:59] <pastebin> if($(this).val() == "iwc") { $('input:radio[name="styrning"]').attr({'unchecked', 'unchecked'}); } else { $('input:radio[name="styrning"]').removeAttr('unchecked'); }
[07:55:04] <pastebin> Am i doing this wrong?
[07:55:08] <thykka> I learned PHP after JS, so my PHP probably looks freakishly functional to most PHP devs :P
[07:55:27] <pastebin> At least you learned both parts, i only learned PHP :D
[07:55:33] <thykka> looks right to me, does it work?
[07:55:42] <pastebin> Hmm, dont think so! Lemme try again
[07:56:04] <thykka> ah.. $('input.radio'), not $('input:radio')
[07:56:15] <thykka> : usually signifies a pseudo-class
[07:56:34] <pastebin> $('input.radio[name="styrning"]').attr({'unchecked', 'unchecked'}); like that instead?
[07:56:48] <pastebin> http://jsfiddle.net/7kjjphc2/2/
[07:56:54] <pastebin> Nope, unless i'm missing something?
[07:59:41] <thykka> more like this, maybe? http://jsfiddle.net/7kjjphc2/3/
[08:00:00] <pastebin> ahhhh
[08:00:07] <thykka> although I made a tiny mistake there
[08:00:11] <pastebin> Oh?
[08:00:32] <thykka> line 6 should only have one parameter; .removeAttr('disabled') and not .removeAttr('disabled', 'disabled')
[08:00:54] <thykka> soo.. this http://jsfiddle.net/7kjjphc2/4/
[08:03:29] <pastebin> Awesome!
[08:03:30] <pastebin> http://jsfiddle.net/7kjjphc2/5/
[08:03:45] <pastebin> In the part "Vinda" for example
[08:03:49] <pastebin> Can i do that?
[08:03:56] <pastebin> class="vinda 12v"
[08:04:25] <pastebin> So i can disable EVERYTHING that is 12v or 24v
[08:04:33] <thykka> yes, that means you have two classes; "vinda" and "12v"
[08:04:36] <thykka> although..
[08:04:37] <pastebin> Yeah!
[08:04:45] <thykka> not sure if classnames are allowed to start with a number
[08:04:53] <pastebin> Oh
[08:06:08] <thykka> or maybe it's okay
[08:06:21] <thykka> IDs had some such restrictions
[08:06:42] <pastebin> In CSS, identifiers (including element names, classes, and IDs in selectors) can contain only the characters [a-zA-Z0-9] and ISO 10646 characters U+00A0 and higher, plus the hyphen (-) and the underscore (_); they cannot start with a digit, two hyphens, or a hyphen followed by a digit. Identifiers can also contain escaped characters and any ISO 10646 character as a numeric code (see next item).
[08:06:49] <pastebin> including... :O
[08:07:19] <pastebin> Could just go with "volt12" and "volt24" to be safe ;)
[08:16:54] <pastebin> thykka - It works PERFECT! thank you! I owe you a beer!
[08:19:10] <thykka> hehe, no problem :)
[10:16:42] <fas3r> Hello
[10:16:54] <taplar> kon'nichiwa
[10:21:15] <fas3r> how should I define the data attribute when creating and appending a element dynamically like this : https://pastebin.com/8HdQgqZa .  Should I define data as an object/array with curly bracket like : data: { name: val, ... } ?
[10:22:11] <taplar> not sure.  if i had to guess i'd assume the key would need to be the 'data-key' format
[10:22:16] <taplar> but you can try and se
[10:23:33] <fas3r> taplar: ok will do
[10:33:22] <rhelic> anybody here use JQXGrid?  Is it possible to change a grid's properties after it's already been rendered?  let's say I want to change the grid height, row height, font size, etc
[10:35:49] <rhelic> oh, should have googled harder, looks like .refresh() also refreshes the settings & properties
[10:58:05] <poboy> will someone help me?  I need to change the options in a dropdown list based on another dropdown list.  jsfiddle won't accept PHP ?
[10:58:40] <taplar> jsfiddle is just client side scripting
[10:58:46] <taplar> what is your issue?
[10:59:48] <poboy> based on the value the user selects in dropdown 1 I need to change "vendors_agency" here for the next dropdown        foreach ($results['vendors_agency'] AS $vendor)
[11:00:23] <poboy> dropdown one may be set to vendors_other  or something, in which case I need dropdown 2 to say foreach ($results['vendors_other'] AS $vendor)
[11:00:37] <poboy> not sure how to change this dynamicall
[11:00:38] <poboy> y
[11:01:23] <taplar> fiddle what you are trying please
[11:03:42] <poboy> https://jsfiddle.net/n0r22xL0/
[11:05:29] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/n0r22xL0/1/
[11:09:18] <poboy> taplar did you change anything?
[11:09:44] <taplar> i took out the first id on the report_vendor selector
[11:09:49] <taplar> since it wasn't in your fiddle
[11:13:59] <poboy> how do I change $results['vendors_agency']  to $results[someVariable] through jquery?
[11:14:32] <taplar> you don't.  that's in the php
[11:15:25] <poboy> guess I'll have to ask someone else to do this for me.  sucks.
[11:15:51] <taplar> you understand that javascript and php live in different worlds, right?
[11:16:45] <poboy> yes
[11:17:19] <taplar> so if you want something in javascript from php, you have to make a network request to the php script and have the script return it
[11:18:09] <poboy> we use returned.results on stuff to make data available in javascript.  I just really really suck at this stuff
[12:32:41] <poboy> so I did an array_merge to combine everything into 1 array and was hoping to only display the results that matched the vendorType but I'm guessing this doesn't work due to my lack of understanding of this vs $(this) ??  https://jsfiddle.net/n0r22xL0/2/
[12:33:37] <poboy> also thinking I may try option name="<?php echo $vendor['vendorType'];?>"  instead of id="<?php echo $vendor['vendorType'];?>"
[12:36:16] <taplar> the 'this' inside the each is an option
[13:07:46] <poboy> yeah, i want to hide those options if the id doesn't match
[13:08:50] <taplar> hiding options isn't a good idea.  not all browsers, namely IE, respect hidden options
[13:09:04] <taplar> they won't show, but they will still show a white space where the option was
[13:09:10] <taplar> iirc
[13:44:25] <poboy> any thoughts on how I should handle this?  Just give up?
[13:46:14] <taplar> can you share out a fiddle with the generated markup, rather than the markup with the php in it?
[13:59:14] <poboy> there are thousands of records so I pared that part down and changed the names in case this is a privacy violation or anything.  https://jsfiddle.net/67y76ra9/1/
[13:59:40] <taplar> so first off, you can't repeat ids
[13:59:47] <poboy> i know
[13:59:50] <taplar> ids are unique identifiers
[14:00:02] <taplar> if you are going to repeat an identifier, make it a class
[14:00:20] <poboy> not sure how the guy was able to do that before but it worked.  that's why I was thinking of using name or something instead of id
[14:00:46] <poboy> either way, i need something that will function.  that markup shows the display:none    but the options still display
[14:01:34] <taplar> i don't see them in chrome
[14:01:42] <poboy> correct
[14:01:46] <poboy> I don't see them either
[14:01:58] <poboy> in my project, the markdown says display:none yet I see them
[14:02:07] <poboy> in the fiddle I do not see them
[14:04:33] <robertmaxrees> what does the style pane tell you?
[14:04:43] <robertmaxrees> wonder if you've got some weird CSS conflict going on.
[14:05:55] <poboy> I tried adding !important to display none but that did nothing
[14:06:49] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/67y76ra9/2/
[14:07:46] <taplar> actually that could be slightly different
[14:08:52] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/67y76ra9/3/
[14:08:55] <poboy> I do see select:not(:-internal-list-box) {     overflow: visible !important; }
[14:09:11] <poboy> it says "user agent stylesheet".  that's in the style pane
[14:09:44] <robertmaxrees> which browser?
[14:10:49] <poboy> chrome
[14:14:08] <robertmaxrees> got any special plugins or anything?
[14:17:23] <poboy> sure.  maybe a couple dozen or so.  Not sure which ones would affect this
[14:17:56] <robertmaxrees> also: you have a doctype on your page, right?
[14:19:49] <poboy> on devtools > elements there is doctype at the top
[14:19:57] <robertmaxrees> in the actual page source.
[14:20:08] <robertmaxrees> the dev tools might be lying to you :)
[14:20:28] <poboy>  <!DOCTYPE html>  on page source.  it's greyed out, not sure what that means
[14:21:04] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[14:21:13] <robertmaxrees> i'm starting to wonder if it's a plugin or invalid markup.
[14:21:45] <poboy> plugins are bootbox, bootsrap-select, bootstrap-slider, bootstrap-tables, bootstrap-wysihtml5, datepicker, daterangepicker, iCheck, input-mask, jQuery, JQueryUI, jsPanel, select2, slimScroll, timepicker, jquery.form.min, uploader
[14:22:17] <robertmaxrees> i mean browser plugins.
[14:22:18] <poboy> there is another place in this project where we do something similar and display:none works
[14:29:50] <robertmaxrees> fa
[14:29:53] <robertmaxrees> woops wrong window.
[15:19:58] <taplar> oooooooh, i'm a rebel just for kicks yeah
[15:22:31] <robertmaxrees> my band is thinking about covering that.
[15:25:44] <taplar> same octave?
[15:26:20] <robertmaxrees> aye - though none of us dudes can sing it.
[15:26:30] <taplar> lol
[15:26:37] <robertmaxrees> luckily our lead singer is a woman
[15:27:02] <taplar> i swore it was a lady for a few days
[15:27:25] <robertmaxrees> dude i thought the same thing until like 2 weeks ago.
[15:27:40] <taplar> but as it turns out, you can't trust the mustache dawning singers
[15:27:48] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[15:28:10] <taplar> and the other one who for some reason hates shirts
[15:28:27] <robertmaxrees> in that band you mean?
[15:28:40] <taplar> different band, the one who sounds like macy gray
[15:29:20] <taplar> i haven't heard the song on the radio in a bit, need to find it
[15:29:22] <robertmaxrees> ooooh yeah
[15:29:58] <taplar> but i saw him performing on like the late show or something, shirt less.  and granted he's jacked, but I was like, come on.  your song is awesome.  put on a shirt
[15:30:09] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[15:30:13] <robertmaxrees> it's childish gambino.
[15:30:23] <robertmaxrees> he's ridiculous.  just what he does.
[17:52:23] <taplar> slow day
[17:55:03] <robertmaxrees> yah...
[17:55:05] <robertmaxrees> *yeah
