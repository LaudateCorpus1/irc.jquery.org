[05:20:52] <JosefDe> Hi guys. I'm having a problem with qtip: https://jsfiddle.net/4edopo7j/5/
[05:21:08] <JosefDe> The problem is, that when I hover over the last column, the 2 qtip's overlay over each other
[05:21:51] <JosefDe> Is there a better way of preventing it than assigning the qtip-information to the single <td>'s instead of the <tr>?
[05:23:48] <JosefDe> If it would be possible to put the <td>'s into a container, it would be easy, but that's not possible in HTML
[06:06:23] <JosefDe> Can anyone help me please?
[06:06:36] <JosefDe> How can I achieve, that qtip follows my mouse inside the table?: https://jsfiddle.net/4edopo7j/5/

[07:11:41] <Azitrex> is there any easy to use library for manipulating a complex json , for example i want to replace / add new / remove item by a path
[09:53:17] <aro> i am using a few libraries that have this jquery factory stuff at the beginning, like this: https://github.com/inuyaksa/jquery.nicescroll
[09:53:24] <aro> but i keep getting that the function is undefined?
[09:53:33] <aro> but when i run it in my console it works
[09:57:56] <aro> i get this on page load: global.js:3970 Uncaught TypeError: $(...).niceScroll is not a function
[12:02:43] <shakil> I need some help regarding jquery css
[12:03:13] <shakil> can anybody help please?
[12:05:44] <Uhkis> not until you ask an actual question
[12:07:28] <shakil> Uhkis: I added css via jquery. It works fine when The page is loaded. but it does not reflect the logics when I resize the window on desktop
[12:07:38] <shakil> but if i reload after reisizing. it works..
[12:08:05] <shakil> i mean it does not changes css values when i'm resizing the window. on the fly
[12:08:11] <Uhkis> are you using the resize event?
[12:08:18] <shakil> nope
[12:08:24] <Uhkis> show some code
[12:08:32] <shakil> http://pastebin.com/GXh0tcNM
[12:09:51] <Uhkis> yeah, you need to use resize event to update those values, otherwise they stay the same as when the page was loaded
[12:10:26] <shakil> Uhkis I should wrap the whole code within resize event?
[12:10:32] <shakil> window.onresize?
[12:11:12] <Uhkis> you kinda need both, resize doesnt happen on normal load afaik
[12:11:32] <shakil> i see
[12:12:18] <shakil> so the code should be both in document.ready and window.resize?
[12:13:07] <Uhkis> at least the parts that need to update those size values
[12:13:19] <shakil> i see
[12:13:23] <shakil> Thank you buddy
[13:11:09] <shakil> can somebody please check this code
[13:11:15] <shakil> http://pastebin.com/svQtSzGq
[13:12:05] <shakil> it says during onresize when the browser is less than 640px wide, append 'small' to body
[13:12:11] <shakil> but it shows many 'small' to body
[13:12:17] <shakil> like 8-9
[13:12:21] <shakil> same for the big
[13:12:27] <shakil> behaves eerily
[13:13:51] <shakil> why does this happen?
[13:40:53] <decx> shakil: resize happens a lot you have to be real careful
[13:47:03] <shakil> decx: you mean other scripts are resizing the window and they are taking affects on my onresize code?
[13:48:03] <decx> no i mean your resize code keep repeating the same thing even when it's not needed
[13:53:28] <shakil> decx: yes
[13:53:33] <shakil> is there any way to fix this?
[13:53:59] <decx> use media queries in css instead
[13:54:22] <shakil> it's a dynamic menu
[13:54:36] <decx> so?
[13:55:32] <shakil> when the screen is under 640px and user clicks a button it open up a form with animation
[13:55:42] <shakil> when the screen size is above that
[13:55:56] <shakil> it opens up another form with animation, when a user clicks a button
[14:00:30] <decx> still seems weird
[14:00:39] <decx> i might have come up with something tho
[14:04:57] <decx> shakil: check this out https://jsfiddle.net/decx/h89L6g6q/
[14:05:07] <decx> i call it, completely pointless js media query
[14:06:33] <shakil> decx it's cool
[14:06:38] <shakil> might solve my problem
[14:06:44] <shakil> gotta try this way
[15:11:07] <antonio_> Hi! Is this right place to ask help with jquery?
[18:47:31] <blitz206> Hi guys, I am sure you have passerby's come in and out of here asking for help! Is there a particular way to request someone to look at something?
[18:56:49] <Starburst> Nope blitz206, just go ahead and ask the question!
[18:57:42] <blitz206> Thanks Starburst!
[18:58:13] <blitz206> I am having trouble implementing fuzzy timestamps using the timeAgo plugin, they simply don't seem to be updating
[18:58:50] <blitz206> I can paste code in JS Fiddle if it helps
[19:37:16] <aro> i am using a few libraries that have this jquery factory stuff at the beginning, like this: https://github.com/inuyaksa/jquery.nicescroll
[19:37:21] <aro> but i keep getting that the function is undefined?
[19:37:25] <aro> but when i run it in my console it works
[19:37:28] <aro> i get this on page load: global.js:3970 Uncaught TypeError: $(...).niceScroll is not a function
[19:42:43] <deryco> aro: had similar issue once because of loading jquery twice
[19:44:37] <aro> hmm
[19:44:41] <aro> ill check
[19:44:51] <aro> is there a way to check to see if jquery loads twice?
[19:45:01] <aro> when i execute the plugin from my console - it works though
[19:45:03] <aro> thats whats weird
[19:49:02] <aro> it appears to only be loading once
[19:50:31] <deryco> is the function you using in  a ready function
[19:50:53] <aro> yeah
[19:51:20] <aro> however, if i load the script manually after the page is loaded using $.getScript('http://cdn.d.digital2go.com/js/nicescroll/jquery.nicescroll.js');
[19:51:22] <aro> it works fine
[19:51:27] <deryco> Did you try screaming at your monitor yet?
[19:51:32] <aro> yeah several times
[19:51:38] <deryco> Damn that usually works
[19:52:10] <aro> however, when i load it using <script> tags, it fails
[19:52:12] <aro> i dont know why
[19:53:56] <aro> and even when i do a <script src="http://cdn.d.digital2go.com/js/nicescroll/jquery.nicescroll.js"></script> it fails
[19:54:43] <aro> even though i see it loading in the network tab
[19:54:54] <deryco> is loading after jquery is loaded
[19:54:58] <aro> yes
[19:55:03] <aro> jquery loads in the preceeding scripe
[19:55:05] <aro> script
[19:57:32] <aro> and it only does it on my dashboard page
[20:00:44] <deryco> gist it
[20:01:52] <aro> what do you want me to gist
[20:01:57] <aro> the plugin?
[20:02:37] <deryco> the dashboard page
[20:03:55] <aro> https://gist.github.com/barrychapman/2f2766c280b4cdb20e49654c1ea9bc99
[20:04:29] <aro> the plugin and call to the plugin are both in global.js
[20:04:37] <aro> jquery is in the d2go.jq.js
[20:07:40] <deryco> aro: Line 486 <script type="text/javascript" src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js"></script> .. second jquery load
[20:07:50] <aro> waaaaaaaaaat
[20:07:53] <aro> !@#^
[20:08:12] <aro> fuckin highcharts
[20:08:14] <aro> good god
[20:08:15] <aro> thank you
[20:08:20] <deryco> yw
[20:08:28] <deryco> make sure thaqt was it
[20:09:40] <aro> i cant find it in my code anywhere
[20:09:50] <aro> highcharts must be including it
[20:10:49] <deryco> they must be but that's most likely whats causing your problem
[20:13:37] <aro> annnnd its fixeD :D
[20:13:39] <aro> thank you so much
[20:13:42] <aro> id never have found that
[20:16:27] <deryco> yw
[20:23:09] <deryco> aro: I think I see you on the cake channel sometimes...just realized on jquery hah
[20:35:50] <z1haze> anyone know if in highcharts you can update the tooltipformat on an existing chart
[22:44:24] <droptone> question: I have a 2 column, 7 row static table where the second column has select dropdown boxes on every row. I'm trying to write some code that detects if one of the select boxes changes...
[22:44:28] <droptone> and if so, checks the values of the other 6 select boxes and if the value of the changed select box matches the value of any of the rows, it flips the other row back to the default "Disabled" value
[22:44:34] <droptone> does anyone have an example of anything like that?
[22:44:43] <droptone> I've been browsing stack overflow for 2 hours
[23:12:35] <deryco> droptone...https://gist.github.com/anonymous/18bf3e7ce029b272fadce936e434adb4
[23:12:53] <deryco> droptone: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/18bf3e7ce029b272fadce936e434adb4
[23:14:18] <droptone> Checking that out, thank you
[23:17:57] <droptone> testing
[23:19:14] <droptone> hmm, it's not working. Oh, I have to set the class of the select boxes to match this, not the table.
[23:19:19] <droptone> altering.
[23:20:34] <droptone> yup, still no effect. Hmm.
[23:21:04] <droptone> Does it matter if the code appears before or after the table?
[23:21:11] <deryco> hang on I fucked that up...gist your select box html
[23:21:33] <droptone> well it's a Rails 4.2.x project so I'll have to gist the HTML generated. One sec
[23:21:40] <deryco> thats fine
[23:22:26] <droptone> with the table, each select box has the class pait_type
[23:22:36] <droptone> why is this not generating the source, heavens.
[23:23:32] <droptone> it's probably because I'm using an AJAX call to pull API data and load the rest of the page.
[23:23:37] <droptone> Let me create a generic table
[23:26:04] <droptone> christ.
[23:26:29] <droptone> Well if you throw up any generic table with a select box that'll do, at least 2 rows for testing and the first item in the options for select being "Disabled"
[23:26:55] <droptone> Yeah, the way I have this coded using an AJAX call to load the tables prevents me from viewing page source
[23:27:09] <droptone> No clue why that's the case
[23:27:23] <droptone> The browser is rendering it
[23:27:28] <droptone> obviously
[23:27:57] <droptone> What's missing with that code you gisted? I set the class of the select boxes to match the class specified
[23:30:20] <droptone> Ok, console.log indicates it's detecting the change but I'm getting a TypeError
[23:30:29] <droptone> 	
[23:30:30] <droptone> typeof length === "number" && length > 0 && ( length - 1 ) in obj;
[23:33:08] <droptone> This is the line generating the TypeError: $.each('.cl_pait_url_type', function(key, val) {
[23:36:34] <droptone> So the .each looping through the other values in the select boxes throws a TypeError
[23:39:38] <deryco> droptone: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f0ed7e05b61cc7ed34838be6cfcceada
[23:39:40] <deryco> try that
