[04:20:18] <mertyildiran_> Hi, I'm trying to use jQuery UI's Autocomplete component but I have an issue. On hover is pretty smooth but on mouse leave (opposite of hover) it seems it has a little bit delay like 1-2 seconds for changing its CSS. What could be the reason and how can I fix that? My jQuery and jQuery UI versions are 1.12.1.
[04:25:13] <Cork> mertyildiran_: autocomplete don't have a hover/out event handler as far as i remember
[04:25:39] <Cork> mertyildiran_: could you make a jsfiddle showing the problem you have?
[04:27:00] <mertyildiran_> Cork: the issue is present in this SO answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45662200/show-image-in-jquery-ui-autocomplete/45662449#45662449
[04:27:38] <mertyildiran_> Cork: both of his snippets in the answer have the same issue
[04:28:09] <mertyildiran_> Cork: hover is smooth and perfectly fine, hover/out has a delay.
[04:30:15] <mertyildiran_> Cork: the other answer has also the same issue: https://stackoverflow.com/a/45663256/2104879
[04:32:11] <mertyildiran_> both of the answers are using a function called `.autocomplete( "instance" )._renderItem` and injecting some custom HTML into results to display images, so maybe that's the problem that jQuery cannot handle properly?
[04:35:19] <mertyildiran_> actually the first snippet in the top answer has not `_renderItem` but the issue is present there too.
[04:40:19] <mertyildiran_> Cork: OK never mind I realized that the transition between the results are smooth but the only hover/out from the complete UI element some delay which is acceptable. Ty for help! :)
[05:19:23] <sudobash74> Hey if I can select a button with let button = $("button:contains('Text')"); why can't I do an .addEventListener to that?
[05:19:46] <sudobash74> like button.addEventListener(event, function, option);
[05:19:53] <Cork> you can, you just need to unwrap the raw dom element
[05:19:57] <Cork> or just use .on()
[05:20:22] <sudobash74> well if I use on, can I call an outside js function?
[05:20:32] <sudobash74> which would be the best option?
[05:20:44] <Cork> "call an outside js function"
[05:20:48] <Cork> what does that mean?
[05:23:17] <sudobash74> Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/3ff458e810525433f80821f8f6608366/pasted.txt
[05:23:31] <sudobash74> gah the formatting..
[05:24:10] <Cork> use jsfiddle if you want to show some code
[05:24:36] <sudobash74> it's complicated because it's cordova and I can't load the entire cordova bridge is jsfiddle
[05:24:38] <sudobash74> in*
[05:24:54] <Cork> ya, but you don't need to either
[05:24:58] <sudobash74> yea true
[05:25:14] <Cork> either way i don't understand what you mean by outside js
[05:25:17] <sudobash74> I think I know where I am going wrong, but what did you mean by unwrap the raw dom element
[05:25:19] <Cork> as it either is js or it isn't
[05:25:27] <Cork> jquery are just helper functions in normal js
[05:25:36] <Cork> so if you run in javascript then it would work just fine
[05:25:42] <Cork> (you do need a dom though)
[05:25:54] <sudobash74> Hmmm yea but then I have something like this that separate's the app code from some functions:
[05:25:55] <sudobash74> (function () {    var app = {
[05:26:14] <sudobash74> and I am trying to call functions that are outside of that
[05:26:17] <sudobash74> from within it
[05:26:55] <sudobash74> and then also from within another function like .click(function() { callfunc() });
[05:27:15] <sudobash74> but that callfunc() is outside the var app {}
[05:27:45] <Cork> (function() {})() is just scoping
[05:28:00] <Cork> it is just so variables and functions defined inside it doesn't exist outside
[05:28:18] <Cork> and ya, if you want to access somethign from inside you can't unless you export it to the outer namespace
[05:28:36] <sudobash74> but the ones outside are global correct, so should be accessible within entire script?
[05:28:43] <sudobash74> ahhh
[05:28:54] <Cork> if it is defined outside you can access it inside just fine ya
[05:29:07] <Cork> just like how it works with any functions
[05:29:07] <sudobash74> hmmm but I can't for some reason
[05:29:16] <sudobash74> yea that's what I thought
[05:29:30] <sudobash74> maybe the names being the same is messing with it, I'll try to change that
[05:29:42] <sudobash74> I always get undefined function
[05:29:43] <Cork> window.exportName = function() {} would export it from the scope to the global scope
[05:29:53] <Cork> (same with any other value)
[05:30:10] <Cork> sudobash74: some environments "fake" same namespace
[05:30:17] <Cork> but are actually on different processes
[05:30:27] <Cork> then you can't ever export functions across them
[05:30:36] <sudobash74> LoL that was it apparently, the function names on the outside conflicted with some names inside
[05:30:43] <Cork> not sure how cordova works, but it isn't related to using jquery or not
[05:30:53] <sudobash74> or at least my IDE indicates it's supposedly fixed
[05:31:20] <sudobash74> no not at all, I just use jquery because it is provided by what I am using and makes selecting elements clean AF
[05:31:44] <Cork> uh, that isn't what i said...
[05:31:59] <Cork> i said if you have scope problems from cordova you should take the question there
[05:32:06] <Cork> cause jquery don't affect that at all
[07:41:04] <mertyildiran> How do I get the input field value in source of jQuery UI Autocomplete? Here is my current state of JS: https://jsfiddle.net/v6nadtg0/
[07:42:18] <mertyildiran> I tried to use $(this) but it's not a reference to the input field in source. The two `console.log($(this))` indicates completely different things
[07:42:44] <Cork> mertyildiran: you shouldn't access the element from inside source it isn't the correct isolation
[07:43:47] <Cork> if you want to modify the search use http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-search
[07:43:54] <mertyildiran> Cork: actually I'm trying to achieve this: https://jsfiddle.net/9csLap57/
[07:44:14] <Cork> that is what request is for
[07:45:00] <Cork> request.term specifically
[07:45:23] <mertyildiran> Cork: OK how am I suppose to get the value of the input field and pass it to `source:` from `search:`?
[07:45:34] <Cork> see what i just typed
[07:46:12] <Cork> mertyildiran: also read the Function type here http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[07:47:54] <mertyildiran> Cork: thanks a lot! You're a saint! :)
[07:57:59] <jquery565> Hi
[07:58:51] <jquery565> I have a query r.e. latest stable release 3.4.0, it's currently broken my cloud releases and I can't pinpoint why based off the release notes
[07:59:00] <jquery565> The errors it shows in the console are;
[07:59:03] <jquery565> main.min.js?v=1555324261312:2 jQuery.Deferred exception: e is not a function TypeError: e is not a function
[07:59:21] <jquery565> Has anyone had anything similar or know how to fix this?
[07:59:23] <Cork> recommend to not use the min version
[07:59:29] <Cork> for debugging
[07:59:44] <Cork> then you can get the actual usfull line number to look at
[08:06:28] <jquery565> The problem code is:  e.console && e.console.warn && t && Se.test(t.name) && e.console.warn("jQuery.Deferred exception: " + t.message, t.stack, n)
[08:06:40] <jquery565> but this does not give much indication of whats specifically broke
[08:07:05] <jquery565> I will re-read release notes but cannot see in my code where it uses deferred
[08:09:25] <Cork> line number?
[08:12:55] <jquery565> 1895 Deferred.exceptionHook
[08:19:40] <Cork> eeeh... 1895 is sizle element filters...
[08:20:46] <Cork> but it sounds like you're talking about window.console && window.console.warn on line 3840
[08:20:51] <Cork> s√• you don't have a window object
[08:20:55] <Cork> so *
[08:21:11] <Cork> (not running in a browser?)
[08:22:14] <jquery565> apologies, yes 3840
[08:22:20] <jquery565> just looking at non min version now
[08:22:24] <jquery565> I'm running it in Chrome
[08:23:15] <Cork> alternatively that is just a catcher for an error in the promise
[08:23:34] <Cork> so check in the error stacktrace for the second source
[08:24:08] <jquery565> I wish I had more detail but that is literally all the console has given me
[08:24:28] <jquery565> he.Deferred.exceptionHook	@	main.min.js?v=1555324261312:2
[08:24:36] <jquery565> It worked fine in 3.3.1
[08:24:39] <jquery565> No code has changed
[08:24:51] <Cork> ya, but again your running with minified code
[08:25:03] <Cork> you're doomed to have problem finding the cause when you do that
[08:26:13] <Cork> replace them with unminified copies and put a breakpoint where you get exception from and back step out until you get to you're code and you most likely have the source
[08:26:28] <Cork> then it is just about figuring out what is doing something wrong there
[08:27:41] <jquery565> Cheers, I'll reference https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.0.js instead and set some breakpoints
[08:27:56] <Cork> don't forget main.js
[08:31:54] <jquery565> What's odd is I can't replicate any errors locally but I can on Azur
[08:31:57] <jquery565> Azure*
[08:33:27] <Cork> might be a latency race cause
[08:33:56] <Cork> the only way to find the cause is to try to reduce what code you run and see when it stops having problems and then go from there
[08:35:54] <jquery565> Ok cheers
[09:42:01] <jquery565> @Cork - I figured out it's bootstrap causing the issue, jquery is a dependency of bootstrap and is forcing the latest version of jquery.
[09:42:32] <Cork> forcing? you mean it injects it it self?
[09:43:38] <jquery565> We use bower to manage front end libraries, and we use bootstrap, and for bootstrap to work it depends on jquery
[09:44:02] <Cork> ah, and you can't lock jquery's version??
[09:44:16] <jquery565> Trying to find a way at the mo but no luck so far
[09:45:23] <Cork> have you tried https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35273782/how-to-force-bower-to-install-a-certain-version-of-dependency ?
[09:45:36] <Cork> (i don't use bower so can't help much)
[09:49:10] <remyo> Hey all, I'm trying to figure out how to adjust this example so it accepts partial searches. For example, if you typed "Johnathan" it'd filter the correct table, but if you typed "John [space]", it won't. Can anyone point me in the right direction for what I'm trying to do?
[09:49:12] <remyo> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/OGOLaG
[09:52:59] <Cork> remyo: what exactly in what you just said doesn't work now?
[09:53:57] <remyo> Cork: I'm trying to figure out how to get partial filtering. For example, if I typed john [space] testing, I'd like it to return the table with johnathan testing
[09:54:18] <remyo> Part of the trouble is I lack the vocab to know what to look for
[09:54:23] <Cork> ok so you want to match separating on space
[09:54:29] <remyo> Yep!
[09:54:51] <Cork> you would have to either split the input string on space and then find rows where each array element exists in the row
[09:55:00] <Cork> or convert the input string to a regex
[09:55:35] <Cork> (though the later would only work if you are ok with "testing john" not finding Johnathan Testing
[10:00:16] <remyo> I'll look into that, thanks Cork
[10:09:01] <jquery565> Managed to specify the specific jquery dependency directly without it going to the latest
[10:09:06] <jquery565> Cheers for your help today Cork
[10:09:13] <jquery565> Site's working again now :)
[10:10:21] <Cork> remyo: just some playing but... https://jsfiddle.net/0wcq6Ljd/3/
[10:10:32] <Cork> jquery565: nice
[10:11:07] <remyo> Cork: You sir are a true American hero
[10:11:07] <Cork> remyo: opps left a debug line https://jsfiddle.net/0wcq6Ljd/5/
[10:11:21] <remyo> I was trying to figure this out myself and was only getting so far
[10:11:30] <Cork> and another one https://jsfiddle.net/0wcq6Ljd/6/

[14:55:23] <mertyildiran> Hi, this autocomplete implementation works perfectly fine and generates elements with ui-menu-item-wrapper class in a page. But in another page it just generates <li class="ui-menu-divider ui-widget-content"><div></div></li> https://jsfiddle.net/418q0Lhy/
[14:55:40] <mertyildiran> What could be the reason? Seems like something is missing but I couldn't figure it out
[14:56:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:56:22] <robertmaxrees> so it's generating elements with that class in both cases?
[14:58:13] <mertyildiran> robertmaxrees: I have updated the fiddle, please take a look https://jsfiddle.net/418q0Lhy/1/
[14:58:30] <robertmaxrees> could you clarify your problem statement? :)
[14:58:36] <robertmaxrees> as-is it doesn't make sense.
[14:59:05] <robertmaxrees> ah, i see.
[14:59:08] <mertyildiran> first of all my setup is quite complex and I don't know how to make it into a jsfiddle.
[14:59:17] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[14:59:24] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it in action.
[14:59:28] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[14:59:39] <mertyildiran> robertmaxrees: no console errors
[14:59:54] <mertyildiran> robertmaxrees: let me share a screenshot, wait please
[15:00:21] <robertmaxrees> a screenshot won't really help but ok lol
[15:01:17] <robertmaxrees> a simplified test case would be ideal - don't need any of the select code, could swap out the source for a static one.
[15:01:28] <robertmaxrees> could probably remove 90% of what's there.
[15:01:42] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pms7h986/
[15:01:44] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[15:06:25] <mertyildiran> robertmaxrees: OK this is the working one https://i.ibb.co/9qQHpBm/Screenshot-20190415-220416.png and this is the broken one https://i.ibb.co/9Nv0snW/Screenshot-20190415-220444.png
[15:06:35] <robertmaxrees> i'm not saying i don't believe you.
[15:06:45] <robertmaxrees> but screenshots of dev tools don't really help :)
[15:07:21] <mertyildiran> robertmaxrees: OK what information do you need?
[15:07:55] <robertmaxrees> without seeing it in action it's really hard to help.  a simplified test case would be best.  you could likely remove 90% of what's in that fiddle to get there.
[15:08:27] <mertyildiran> by the way whenever I click somewhere on the browser(even in the developer tools) the autocomplete box disappears. How can I prevent that?
[15:08:31] <robertmaxrees> also: i'd triple check to make sure your code is even on-page.  make sure it's showing up in the "sources"panel
[15:08:39] <robertmaxrees> one thing at a time pls :)
[15:09:39] <mertyildiran> robertmaxrees: I mean I want to share the exact same HTML content but I cannot copy it since it disappears. Is there a way to freeze developer tools' Elements tab?
[15:09:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:10:02] <robertmaxrees> super confused lol
[15:10:12] <robertmaxrees> but https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9606671/how-to-disable-closing-of-datepicker-on-jquery-ui-datepicker
[15:11:23] <mertyildiran> robertmaxrees: I don't know how to use the same method with jQuery UI Autocomplete :/
[15:11:56] <robertmaxrees> did you even try? :)
[15:12:12] <robertmaxrees> iirc the autocomplete api has a similar method.
[15:13:40] <robertmaxrees> but showing me the end result isn't really going to be helpful.
[15:13:49] <robertmaxrees> we're clear on what the issue is, but it's hard to know why.
[15:57:40] <mertyildiran> robertmaxrees: I solved the problem. Autocomplete cannot bind itself to classes like this $(".face-index").find("input:first").autocomplete(... instead you have to use id to pick a single element $("#face-index-456d72a5-158c-4554-864f-5debf9b381ef").find("input:first").autocomplete(...
[15:57:59] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make any sense.
[15:58:09] <mertyildiran> robertmaxrees: that's a strange behavior isn't it? Like I do not expect such a thing form jQuery
[15:58:12] <robertmaxrees> console.log($(".face-index").find("input:first").length) - what do you get?
[15:58:41] <mertyildiran> robertmaxrees: 3 there are 3 elements/pictures that I see
[15:58:52] <robertmaxrees> so did you do the console log?
[15:58:54] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:59:12] <mertyildiran> robertmaxrees: just like the screenshots that I sent to you
[15:59:19] <robertmaxrees> aaaand one more time
[15:59:25] <robertmaxrees> did you do that console.log i just shared?
[15:59:27] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:00:23] <robertmaxrees> back
[16:00:27] <mertyildiran> robertmaxrees: welcome back again :) yes I run that console log and I get 3
[16:00:42] <robertmaxrees> then something else is the issue
[16:01:02] <robertmaxrees> bbiab meeting
[16:52:51] <robertmaxrees> what a day
[16:59:28] <mertyildiran> robertmaxrees: :) what was that meeting?

[17:12:41] <NitroLiq> Hi all, looking for a little help. I have a button that is cloning a block of form elements (2 selects, an input and textarea). So far so good. Where I'm running into trouble is with the IDs on each input. How can I increment them dynamically when I'm not cloning them individually?
[17:13:06] <NitroLiq> Basic pen is here: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/jRaGEd?editors=1010
[17:14:04] <robertmaxrees> :|
[17:14:07] <NitroLiq> Cloning works. Max limit of 5 clones work. Clearing the cloned inputs works. I just need to sort the IDs
[17:14:41] <robertmaxrees> var theClone - $('.meal-request-block:first').clone();
[17:14:58] <robertmaxrees> totalCount = $('.meal-request-block').length;
[17:14:59] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[17:18:39] <NitroLiq> Not sure what you're getting at other than create vars for everything to make it cleaner.
[17:18:53] <robertmaxrees> then incremebt the totalCound and set the new ID.
[17:18:59] <robertmaxrees> *increment
[17:19:22] <NitroLiq> But it's on the individual inputs not the cloned container
[17:19:42] <NitroLiq> Oh wait
[17:19:55] <robertmaxrees> :) you can move those selectors around as need be.
[18:01:20] <beshoo> what is the CORRECT way to use jquery  to "sendKey" to an input box which will trigger browser default as when you use the keyboard ?
[18:01:44] <robertmaxrees> you don't use jquery for that :)_
[18:02:09] <beshoo> What is the Advice ?
[18:02:48] <Gh0st_Preacher> woops.
[18:08:22] <beshoo> robertmaxrees , what is your advice ?
[18:08:32] <beshoo> and can JavaScript do that ?
[18:08:33] <robertmaxrees> native JS
[18:09:05] <beshoo> My question , will that refelct to the dom ?
[18:09:19] <robertmaxrees> so back way, way up
[18:09:23] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to do that?
[18:10:27] <beshoo> Well, it is a challenge with our team.
[18:10:41] <beshoo> to type via javascript and  trigger browser default
[18:10:54] <beshoo> not only change the value of the textbox
[18:11:59] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/12187302
[18:12:54] <beshoo> what is the selector ?
[18:13:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:13:13] <beshoo> $(".input")
[18:13:25] <robertmaxrees> don't use jquery for this/
[18:14:28] <beshoo> so i need to focus on the input and run that code
[18:16:53] <beshoo> how can i select the element ?
[18:18:01] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/focus
[18:18:13] <robertmaxrees> document.querySelector or document.querySelectorAll
[18:18:17] <robertmaxrees> then use .focus()
[18:18:21] <robertmaxrees> then dispatch the event,
[18:18:30] <robertmaxrees> head over to ##javascript for more assistance :)
[18:57:50] <beshoo> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/z46wcbr0/1/
[18:58:32] <robertmaxrees> ok?
[18:59:15] <beshoo> is that correct ?
[18:59:17] <robertmaxrees> so what have you tried?
[18:59:28] <beshoo> but nothing appear in the input
[18:59:41] <beshoo> document.querySelector('textarea').focus();
[18:59:44] <beshoo> as you adviced
