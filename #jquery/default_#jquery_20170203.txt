[01:15:50] <slax0r> morning
[01:18:12] <leaJr> Hello
[01:19:07] <leaJr> I want to change my button text using javascript:$('#btnsub').value = 'Save'; void(0); but my button text not changed
[01:19:42] <leaJr> How to change button text via url?
[01:30:15] <Cork> leaJr: jquery uses functions
[01:30:31] <Cork> value would create a property on the object created by $() and not do anything
[01:30:42] <Cork> http://learn.jqeury.com/
[01:30:50] <leaJr> Cork, thanks
[01:32:17] <leaJr> In my <button> element i use javascript:$('#btnsub').html('Save'); void(0); and its work button text changed, but in my input type button is not work
[01:33:17] <leaJr> Input type button i also use value = 'save' and val('save') but still not work
[01:35:08] <Cork> leaJr: i would recommend learning to write modern javascript and stop putting it in the html
[01:35:27] <Cork> the javascript: syntax is out of the 90's and very messy
[01:36:20] <Cork> also button elements doesn't have urls
[01:37:59] <slax0r> not with the ES20xx anymoar!!1oneone
[01:38:11] <leaJr> Cork, this i need in my android webview app with javascript interface enabled, that script will run from android webview app, webView.loadUrl("javascript: ... ");
[01:38:38] <Cork> <_<'
[01:38:55] <Cork> there must be a cleaner way to do that...
[01:40:01] <leaJr> in <button id=""> element, is work using .html('Save');
[01:40:16] <leaJr> I have no idea in input type button
[01:42:50] <leaJr> Its something like run javascript from browser address bar
[01:43:06] <Cork> something browsers doesn't support anymore
[01:44:12] <leaJr> .html('save'); is work in chrome browser
[01:47:33] <leaJr> javascript:alert('save'); will show alert, but in chrome we need to type manually, (javascript: ...)
[01:48:14] <leaJr> Something like that, but in my case i need to change my input type button
[04:23:29] <akshat> Hello everyone, I was looking out to try for GSOC this time, and jquery interests me a lot. Can anyone help me to get started?
[04:27:53] <Cork> akshat: https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students https://contribute.jquery.org/
[04:28:05] <Cork> akshat: also ask in #jquery-dev might be a good idea
[04:52:43] <akshat> Cork: Thank you !
[06:25:51] <PeterPorka> Hi all, i have got a problem when removing a dom element with the scroll position, when i remove the first section (w&h 100%) the scroll position has to be 0 but it jumps to the middle
[06:27:35] <Cork> PeterPorka: wait, are you saying the scroll possition jumps DOWN when you remove an element?
[06:28:17] <Cork> that it jumps up, is a fairly common problem, but i've never seen it go down
[06:29:33] <PeterPorka> Cork: it should jump up to 0 but i have to scroll to top 0, setting a timeout with 200ms with $(window).scrollTop(0); works but it's not really cool cause you can see the jump
[06:29:50] <Cork> O_o
[06:30:08] <Cork> is it on 0 when you remove the element?
[06:30:19] <PeterPorka> nope its somewhere in the middle
[06:30:23] <Cork> ah
[06:30:32] <Cork> well the page doesn't scroll up automatically
[06:30:35] <PeterPorka> yes
[06:30:43] <Cork> it gets pushed up when the page hits the end of the page
[06:30:55] <Cork> what happens is it hits the when but not enough to push it to 0
[06:31:04] <Cork> so ya, you will have to scroll it manually
[06:31:17] <PeterPorka> i have a listener to a scroll position if its reached the i remove the element and add a fixed menu after that it the scroll position should be 0
[06:31:18] <Cork> shouldn't need to do that with a timer though
[06:32:01] <PeterPorka> i dont want to use a timer
[06:32:19] <PeterPorka> but remvoing the el and set scroller to 0 does not work
[06:32:23] <Cork> adding or removing elements doesn't modify the scroll position as long as the page end isn't hit
[06:33:04] <Cork> sounds like you have some other code changing the scroll position then
[06:34:13] <Cork> btw remember that scroll events are async
[06:34:20] <Cork> the browser fires them "when it gets time"
[06:34:38] <Cork> so you won't get an update each time the page scrolls
[06:34:45] <PeterPorka> http://pastebin.com/Ai5U2UJ8
[06:34:48] <PeterPorka> thats the code
[06:35:13] <PeterPorka> after display none i need to reset the scroll position to 0
[06:35:13] <Cork> uh
[06:35:23] <Cork> that is setting the potion of the fixed element
[06:35:25] <Cork> not scroll
[06:35:41] <Cork> anyway afk lunch
[06:35:56] <PeterPorka> yes i delete the part with the scroll position cause it did not work
[06:50:13] <OS-18137> why does my $.each loop fail? http://pastebin.com/raw/baBcQQ7m
[06:54:01] <OS-18137> ok, when i removed .append from the chain, i now get a single .html insertion, with the variable 'v' containing the value [Object, Object]
[07:09:09] <Cork> OS-18137: its .append() or .html() not .append.html()
[07:09:34] <Cork> OS-18137: .append() and .html does basically the same thing except .html runs .empty() before
[07:25:39] <OS-18137> Cork: thanks, cool i didnt know that about .html(). i figured out that i wanted to use .append, and now i have this http://pastebin.com/raw/kT0WckQb, which looks like this https://ibin.co/3B7OkfiLG3BE.png
[07:26:30] <OS-18137> looks like i need to iterate again using $.each so i can get to the data within each elements.object
[07:27:27] <Cork> OS-18137: also what you prob want to do is $('#content').html($.map(myObj.elements, function(v, i) { return $('<div>', { text: v })[0]; }))
[07:28:04] <Cork> it adds the elements without doing a reflow for each loop (appending in a loop on an element that is attached to the page is expensive)
[07:28:56] <Cork> OS-18137: you could do that from the v variable in the first loop
[07:29:33] <Cork> btw, use jsfiddle.net, then you can create a running example, and not just a code dump
[07:32:24] <OS-18137> Cork: very cool, thanks. that $.map within .html() is really clever, and does the trick for iteration. for some reason i havent got v actually printing, the div's are empty
[07:32:50] <Cork> OS-18137: could you generate a jsfiddle?
[07:33:01] <OS-18137> & thanks for the tip about jsfiddle
[07:33:13] <OS-18137> sure thing one sec i'll drop the link once its set up
[07:38:46] <OS-18137> ok here it is Cork https://jsfiddle.net/be1sbkc1/
[07:42:58] <Cork> OS-18137: https://jsfiddle.net/be1sbkc1/2/
[07:43:22] <Cork> the map was meant to replace the each loop
[07:43:27] <Cork> not be called inside it :)
[07:44:06] <OS-18137> lol, rad. thanks so much
[07:44:18] <OS-18137> :) skills
[07:57:09] <OS-18137> night
[08:03:25] <stennowork> good day, is there a difference between $.ajax(foo).then(callback); and $.ajax(foo).done(callback); ?
[08:03:52] <Cork> yes
[08:04:07] <Cork> .then will replace the content of the deferred callback
[08:04:50] <Cork> $.ajax().done(function(data) { data == "hello" }).done(function(data) { data == "hello" })
[08:05:02] <Cork> $.ajax().then(function(data) { data == "hello" }).done(function(data) { data == undefined })
[08:05:23] <stennowork> i see, thanks!
[08:05:30] <Cork> $.ajax().then(function(data) { data == "hello"; return "world"; }).done(function(data) { data == "world; })
[08:05:59] <Cork> so i recommend using .done unless you explicitly need to modify what other callbacks get
[08:06:07] <stennowork> right, thank you
[08:07:09] <Uhkis> and you can chain multiple thens, right?
[08:07:15] <Cork> yes
[08:07:29] <Cork> and interleave
[08:07:41] <Cork> .then().always().done().then().done()
[08:07:46] <Uhkis> but then() again question had ; after it
[08:08:03] <stennowork> interesting
[08:08:08] <Cork> ya, i rappidly typed it out a bit messy
[08:08:19] <Cork> didn't really think it mattered much
[08:08:23] <Uhkis> i bet taplar would've appreciated that joke!
[08:08:42] <stennowork> hm what if then returns a promise itself?
[08:08:47] <stennowork> a deferred
[08:08:59] <Cork> stennowork: i think jquery 3+ handles that
[08:09:09] <Cork> as deferred is promise compatible
[08:09:26] <stennowork> do we have A/+ promises in jq 3?
[08:09:29] <Cork> but haven't tested that so can't say for sure
[08:14:35] <stennowork> i should just get async/await working and then with modernizr polyfills
[08:37:00] <dglambert> morning
[08:37:09] <shambat> honest question: is jQuery still the simplest way to add REST-client functionality to an app?
[08:42:14] <stennowork> there is fetch now
[08:42:32] <stennowork> not 100% sure what you mean with rest-client functionality
[08:42:44] <stennowork> the ability to send ajax requests to the server?
[08:43:00] <shambat> stennowork: what you get with $.ajax pretty much
[08:43:10] <stennowork> https://davidwalsh.name/fetch
[08:43:40] <stennowork> also see http://caniuse.com/#search=fetch
[08:43:53] <stennowork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API
[08:44:34] <Cork> stennowork: fetch is very very new
[08:44:43] <Cork> i'm not even sure it is fully speced yet
[08:44:45] <stennowork> yes, thats true
[08:45:06] <stennowork> its in the living standard
[08:45:11] <stennowork> https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/
[08:45:24] <Cork> doesn't mean it is fully speced yet :)
[08:45:37] <stennowork> it doesn't? :|
[08:45:39] <Cork> shambat: also there is a plugin for jquery to add restful functions
[08:45:53] <Cork> no, they add the basic functionally and then add additional features later
[08:47:25] <shambat> what is the main advantage of fetch? the underlying implementation uses promises in fetch, which is better for async?
[08:47:48] <Cork> that and it gives you 3xx server responses
[08:47:56] <Cork> something that was transparently hidden in xhr
[08:48:05] <Cork> (-was +is)
[08:48:28] <stennowork>  another advantage is that you have a lean and clean way for ajax requests without having to rely on jquery
[08:48:32] <Cork> and it has no sync format at all
[08:48:50] <Cork> well xhr isn't that hard to use
[08:49:00] <Cork> so if you want a none jquery way you can use that
[08:49:22] <stennowork> true enough, but the question was about 'the simplest way'
[08:49:34] <Cork> the simplest way is still $.ajax
[08:49:38] <shambat> it's been a couple years since I've made a JS app, so I wanted to check in to see what the latest was
[08:49:43] <stennowork> i.e. something simpler than $.ajqax
[08:49:46] <stennowork> $.ajax(
[08:49:48] <stennowork> argh
[08:50:23] <Cork> how can it be simpler the $.ajax(url, { type: 'DELETE' }).done().fail() ?
[08:50:30] <Cork> it is quite minimal :)
[08:51:54] <stennowork> fetch(url, { method: "DELETE"}).then().catch();
[08:52:27] <Cork> that would be equal, not simpler :)
[08:53:53] <stennowork> but if the support was good enough, i'd use fetch instead of jquery $.ajax because $.ajax... needs jquery :P
[08:54:21] <Cork> true, though you could make a limited jquery version with basically just ajax
[08:54:32] <stennowork> stiiillll :P
[08:54:44] <Cork> ya, i get you
[08:54:47] <stennowork> ^_^"
[08:54:53] <Cork> have a look at pure xhr
[08:54:59] <Cork> it isn't THAT horrible
[08:55:04] <stennowork> true enough
[08:55:30] <Cork> i often use it directly, though i often use jquery cause of readability
[08:55:45] <Cork> so i kinda don't have to worry about "just for $.ajax :D)
[08:55:51] <stennowork> :)
[08:56:11] <shambat> yeah I', taking over some code and the previous person has implemented get/post/put etc using raw xhr ... which works I suppose
[08:57:06] <Cork> ya, it is much easier to leave over a project based around jquery then raw js
[09:13:24] <budfox> Hiya! Can anybody suggest ways to simplify this d3.js financial chart? https://jsfiddle.net/askhflajsf/o5tcgL98/ (http://d3fc.io/)
[09:15:37] <budfox> Oops that was meant for #javascript
[09:29:16] <DexDeadly> anyone here familiar with datatables
[09:29:58] <DexDeadly> able to help me with a quick question
[09:39:17] <Uhkis> DexDeadly: just ask.
[09:40:15] <stennowork> a better way to do (a ? a : b) would be (a || b), right?
[09:40:57] <stennowork> eep
[09:41:03] <stennowork> that was for ##javascript too >_>
[09:46:28] <MikeD_> stennowork: no, that's not "better"
[09:46:50] <stennowork> MikeD_, why not?
[09:48:14] <MikeD_> there are some edge cases with falsey values of a that you you actually did want to be assigned
[09:48:45] <stennowork> but that'd be the case for a ? a : b too
[09:48:48] <MikeD_> so the ternary can be more explicit about  a === undefined ? a : b; rather than a is falsey
[09:49:04] <stennowork> so more precise, (a !== false) ? a : b
[09:49:15] <stennowork> and that wouldn't work for a || b
[09:49:18] <stennowork> i see now, thanks
[09:49:19] <MikeD_> what about when a is undefined
[09:49:50] <MikeD_> so i wasn't saying that it's not useful, but they're not 100% interchangeable - know why and you'll be ok.
[09:50:23] <shoky> what values of a would make them different?
[09:51:48] <stennowork> ternary allows for an explicit condition
[09:51:52] <MikeD_> if you are using a || b to mean the first non-false (and also not undefined) value, then you're fine
[09:51:58] <stennowork> OR is implicit falsey
[09:52:01] <stennowork> || that is
[09:52:06] <shoky> you asked about the condition being just `a` though
[09:52:15] <stennowork> true
[09:52:16] <shoky> a||b vs a?a:b
[09:52:24] <MikeD_> if you are using it as a naive way to say first defined value, you can get wrong results when a is defined, but 0, false, NaN, etc.
[09:52:29] <shoky> can't think of any case where those would not be equivalent
[09:52:37] <stennowork> if i just consider falsiness (which i actually do), a || b should be shorter
[09:52:45] <MikeD_> yes, i was oversharing perhaps
[09:53:54] <MikeD_> ok, i was 'triggered' calling one "better" than the other  :p
[10:43:17] <EugenA> anybody using requirejs? cannot use fusejs
[11:36:40] <bel3atar> How do I make jQuery wait for an async call in jqXhr.beforeSend ?
[12:11:55] <graingert> bel3atar: you can't
[12:18:30] <rockwood> graingert: https://jsfiddle.net/wwvxf3dg/  my alert not working
[12:18:48] <rockwood> where i am doing mistake
[12:18:53] <graingert> ...?
[12:19:04] <robertmaxrees> rockwood need to add jquery to that fiddle.
[12:19:17] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wwvxf3dg/2/
[12:19:22] <graingert> rockwood: don't use <a href for a button
[12:19:24] <graingert> use <button
[12:19:37] <graingert> rockwood: use codepen or plunker
[12:19:45] <robertmaxrees> why not jsfiddle?
[12:22:11] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) welp
[12:22:49] <rockwood> graingert: in <a tags .click not works ?
[12:23:00] <graingert> rockwood: it's semantically incorrect
[12:23:05] <graingert> use <button for butten
[12:23:06] <robertmaxrees> rockwood it does, but you're trying to use button styles on links.
[12:23:09] <graingert> <button for button
[12:23:14] <graingert> <a for anchors
[12:23:23] <graingert> use the tools for what they're for
[12:23:27] <robertmaxrees> rockwood click works on anchors just fine, but it's not what you want here.
[12:24:24] <robertmaxrees> you also didn't include jquery in your fiddle so it's not going to work either way.
[12:24:34] <rockwood> robertmaxrees: actually i wanna use ajax on click for update data in php
[12:24:42] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[12:25:03] <robertmaxrees> the binding itself is pretty consistent.
[12:30:20] <rockwood> robertmaxrees: https://codepen.io/cyberia/pen/apGKrg
[12:30:54] <robertmaxrees> same problem duder.
[12:30:58] <robertmaxrees> not including jquery in the pen.
[12:31:41] <robertmaxrees> and use a button instead.
[12:31:53] <robertmaxrees> https://codepen.io/cyberia/pen/apGKrg?editors=1010
[12:42:29] <rockwood> robertmaxrees: still the issue https://codepen.io/cyberia/pen/ggzjMx
[12:42:53] <rockwood> robertmaxrees: still  same issue https://codepen.io/cyberia/pen/ggzjMx
[12:43:06] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:43:13] <rockwood> alert is not working
[12:43:13] <robertmaxrees> still not jquery included duder.
[12:43:15] <robertmaxrees> same problem.
[12:43:16] <robertmaxrees> each time.
[12:43:39] <robertmaxrees> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/dNejpX
[12:49:17] <rockwood> code is working here but not working my real pages
[12:49:25] <robertmaxrees> any console errors on your page?
[12:49:34] <robertmaxrees> do you create that element via js somehow?
[12:49:34] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[12:49:35] <rockwood> no error there
[12:50:10] <robertmaxrees> try checking to see if the element exists when you do the binding.
[12:56:55] <rockwood> robertmaxrees: https://paste.ee/p/AdNdq
[12:58:12] <rockwood> <script src="http://localhost/admin/dist/js/jquery-2.2.0.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[12:58:30] <robertmaxrees> that 404ing for you?
[12:58:36] <robertmaxrees> and is that before your code?
[12:59:55] <rockwood> robertmaxrees: no error
[13:00:11] <robertmaxrees> does that element get created via js?
[13:00:17] <rockwood> my all other things are very fine to mee
[13:00:19] <robertmaxrees> or is it there on pageload?
[13:00:32] <rockwood> yes jquery
[13:00:40] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[13:00:46] <robertmaxrees> try using a delegated listener instead.
[13:00:47] <rockwood> means
[13:01:03] <robertmaxrees> basically, jquery can't bind to an element before it exists.
[13:01:16] <robertmaxrees> check out http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[13:06:02] <rockwood> robertmaxrees: $('#upsub').on( "click",function  i did but still same issue
[13:06:24] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:06:35] <rockwood> ?
[13:06:37] <robertmaxrees> $('#upsub') needs to be a parent that exists on pageload.
[13:06:42] <robertmaxrees> and you're missing the second arg.
[13:06:47] <robertmaxrees> you skipped to the first example ;)
[13:07:07] <robertmaxrees> $('someparenthere').on('click', '#upsub', function() {});
[13:07:30] <rockwood> but my others functions are working fine for me
[13:07:42] <robertmaxrees> sounds like race conditions.
[13:07:51] <rockwood> and i did same there
[13:08:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah, race conditions.  sounds like you're beating it sometimes and not others.
[13:11:19] <rockwood> robertmaxrees: thanks but i can't solve i will try morning its very late night
[13:11:37] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:11:38] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[13:23:58] <TubbyTommy> I'm trying to stop a form submission from actually sending data to a server, so I'm returning false "return false;" in the .submit() event handler for the <form></form> that it's attached to but I still get an XMLHttpRequest cannot load xxxx error, how can I stop the XMLHttpRequest from going through?
[13:27:11] <robertmaxrees> mind showing your code?
[13:29:02] <TubbyTommy> Sorry, I just realized the problem. I needed to hit SHIFT-F5 in my browser is all, it works.
[13:29:06] <TubbyTommy> Thank You
[13:29:17] * TubbyTommy slaps himself in the face 
[13:59:11] <quechon> i have this html code https://hastebin.com/ewudicodaz.xml im trying to the .cSub to show when replysub is click now the problem is that when that button or link is click all of the .cSub show i just want one to show  https://hastebin.com/tehupotilo.js
[14:00:39] <taplar> commentcontainer is the parent to all things
[14:01:11] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:01:22] <robertmaxrees> you're going to that container and then finding all .cSub elements.
[14:01:57] <quechon> ok i see
[14:02:41] <quechon> which one should i use
[14:02:59] <robertmaxrees> looks like the element you want is the child of a sibling element.
[14:16:37] <quechon> robertmaxrees: i get what you are saying but somehow cannot get it to work meaning dont know what elements to use
[14:17:04] <robertmaxrees> link again?
[14:17:44] <quechon> https://hastebin.com/ewudicodaz.xml https://hastebin.com/tehupotilo.js
[14:18:56] <robertmaxrees> okay, so see how csub is a sibling of that  <div class="col-md-12"> ?
[14:19:26] <robertmaxrees> where that div is an ancestor of the element you care about.
[14:19:40] <quechon> yes
[14:20:09] <robertmaxrees> so you want to .closest() to that parent, then grab the .next() element.  even better, give that col-md-12 another class that describes what it is.
[14:20:39] <robertmaxrees> even better than that, wrap a container around the both of those elements to group them semantically and give that a good class and use that for the .closest() instead.
[14:20:43] <robertmaxrees> then you don't need the .next()
[14:21:22] <quechon> ok sir let me work on that
[14:27:37] <quechon> thanks a lot got it to work forgot how important divs are
[14:28:19] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[15:00:06] <ckb> Hey there… Any reason why $(“el”).width(‘375px’); would apply a width of 378px?
[15:12:19] <Darmani> Hi everyone. I have a jQuery confirm in one of my forms but even if a user clicks cancel it still submits.
[15:12:24] <Darmani> Don't know why.
[15:12:46] <taplar> ckb: i would think the inline would have a width of 375, but any margins/borders/padding might inflate an inspection.
[15:13:24] <ckb> taplar: ah borders!
[15:16:49] <Darmani> nvm I got it.
[15:58:41] <TubbyTommy> My click event handler isn't getting called when I click on an <a></a> element using jQuery. I set the event handler using the onclick="" attribute of the <a></a> because that's the way it was shown to me. F12 tools in Chrome show the handler is set but I don't know what crazy stuff jQuery/jQuery.mobile is doing behind the scenes.
[15:59:06] <ckb> TubbyTommy: make sure there’s an href on the anchor. Ran into that one the other day
[15:59:59] <TubbyTommy> Yep it's on both, one is href="#" the other goes to a different <div data-role="page">
[16:00:44] <taplar> TubbyTommy: you should bind your click handler with jQuery rather than inline.  jQuery doesn't know anything about inline bindings
[16:01:05] <TubbyTommy> really? Google Chrome shows it as being setup
[16:01:15] <TubbyTommy> in the VM or whatever
[16:01:43] <TubbyTommy> VM5600 = (function(event){callEdit(0);})
[16:02:27] <taplar> i'm not saying it does not work.  i'm saying it is an older way of binding that has limitations vs binding in the logic
[16:03:04] <TubbyTommy> I agree, I still wonder why it doesn't work
[16:03:24] <taplar> i'd have to see a code snipplet to investigate
[17:32:12] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[18:00:01] <taplar> this week flew
[18:10:30] <mlt-> How would I go about $.ajax that is supposed to receive both json and javascript to execute?
[18:11:00] <mlt-> It seems that I can achieve either one but not both... so far
[18:11:32] <mlt-> What do I specify in dataType and/or accepts?
[18:49:51] <quechon> im trying to show  a textarea but cannot get to show the one below the the element im clicking https://hastebin.com/igitiducuz.js https://hastebin.com/ewudicodaz.xml
[19:56:30] * ekkis greets everyone
[19:56:50] <robertmaxrees> whuddup
[19:56:50] <ekkis> I want to subordinate the submission of a form on a promise and I'm not sure quite how
[19:57:20] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[19:57:27] <ekkis> so I have $('#myform').submit(function() { return functionThatReturnsAPromise(); })
[19:57:32] <ekkis> how can I do it?
[19:57:48] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:57:55] <robertmaxrees> so you wnat to submit when the promise resolves?
[19:57:58] <robertmaxrees> orrr...?
[19:58:16] <ekkis> I want to prevent submission should the value resolved by a promise be negative
[19:58:29] <robertmaxrees> you cannot do that.
[19:58:43] <robertmaxrees> you have to hand the submission itself over to that resolve.
[19:58:43] <ekkis> so before allowing submission, I go check on something and if that eventually resolves to true, then great, otherwise, prevent submission
[19:58:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah, doesn't work that way.
[19:59:26] <ekkis> but when I do $('#myform').submit(function() {...}) I'm installing a handler that gets triggered by some user event... so how do I do it?
[20:00:17] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to use .on() and .trigger()
[20:00:39] <robertmaxrees> when you trigger the event when your thing resolves, you can pass in an extra param that you check for in .on()
[20:00:56] <ekkis> .on('submit', ...) how is that any different from .submit(...)?
[20:01:15] <robertmaxrees> .submit() is just a covenience method for .on('submit')
[20:01:29] <ekkis> oh... so my handler always fails but if my promise resolves to true then I manually submit
[20:01:34] <robertmaxrees> yes
[20:01:47] <robertmaxrees> but also
[20:01:48] <ekkis> and how do I prevent my handler that always resolves to false from preventing my manual submission?
[20:01:56] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/ - you can pass extra params.
[20:02:06] <robertmaxrees> you pass those params via trigger.
[20:02:06] <ekkis> ah
[20:02:07] <ekkis> right
[20:02:14] <robertmaxrees> so if they don't exist, preventDefault().
[20:02:19] <robertmaxrees> if they DO, allow it to happen.
[20:02:21] <ekkis> I didn't finish reading your previous statements... a semaphore
[20:03:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah sorry.  i do that sometimes :)
[20:03:07] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:04:58] <ekkis> so... $('#myform').submit(function() { if (semaphore) return true; myPromise.then(function(res) { if (res) { semaphore=true; $('#myform').submit(); } }); return false; }
[20:05:14] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to use .on() in this case.
[20:05:38] <ekkis> though in that case semaphore is a global var and not particular to the specific request... how?
[20:05:39] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/ - see that data option?
[20:05:53] * ekkis looks
[20:05:57] <robertmaxrees> read prior statement - you're passing it in via .trigger()
[20:06:07] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[20:06:16] <robertmaxrees> also see the extraParameters here.
[20:06:36] <ekkis> oh... very cool
[20:06:42] <ekkis> let me see if I can compose it...
[20:07:25] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#passing-data
[20:07:27] <robertmaxrees> ekkis ^
[20:07:36] <robertmaxrees> this is more specific to what you're looking at.  give that a gander
[20:08:16] <ekkis> so... $('#myform').on('submit', semaphore, function() { if (semaphore) return true; myPromise.then(function(res) { if (res) { semaphore=true; $('#myform').trigger('submit', true); } }); return false; })
[20:08:56] <robertmaxrees> something like that.
[20:09:09] <robertmaxrees> it's been a while.
[20:09:11] <robertmaxrees> check the docs.
[20:11:44] <ekkis> oh... I see... so it would be more like... $('#myform').on('submit', function(event) { if (event.data.semaphore) return true; myPromise.then(function(res) { if (res) { $('#myform').trigger('submit', {semaphore: true}); } }); return false; })
[20:11:56] <ekkis> I think that would work... I'll give it a try
[20:12:01] <ekkis> complicated
[20:30:32] <TubbyTommy> What does "plug-in only" mean?
[20:33:08] <TubbyTommy> http://api.jquerymobile.com/button/
[20:34:06] <TubbyTommy> I'd say about 90% down the page (since the webmaster has never learned about URL fragments) it talks about the refresh option. It looks like both a function and an argument to the butt() function. This page is very confusing.
[20:43:06] <quechon> with sibling
[20:43:32] <quechon> how to select the element after the element using the sibling
[20:44:42] <quechon> sibling shows me all the elements before and after  i just need the one after
[20:52:02] <TubbyTommy> Sounds like a CSS question
[21:00:52] <cannap> yea go back in css
[21:00:53] <cannap> how :D
[21:01:08] <cannap> ah miss read sry
[21:02:54] <TubbyTommy> jQuery mobile is doing some crazy stuff with buttons, it's like yeah we know there are already HTML 5 elements called buttons but were going use other elements and pretend their buttons.
[21:04:15] <TubbyTommy> It's like going into a hardware store and buying a hammer because you need a screwdriver. So you treat the hammer like it's a screwdriver. *face palm*
[23:27:29] <rockwood> https://paste.ofcode.org/r87B6ebxRuEwupAYPebmLA  alert not working for me
[23:29:34] <rockwood> in first ajax code i m wanna call another ajx this my motto to use inside another jquery function
