[00:19:38] <borracciaBlu> hi all. Apparently jqueryui https://download.jqueryui.com/download is down i got 502
[00:57:41] <Cork> borracciaBlu: ya, it happens every few months, you can get the base themes from http://code.jquery.com/ui/
[11:41:10] <AntoineDTD> Hello guys i do have a problem with an on click action:
[11:41:10] <AntoineDTD> i made a pastie => https://pastebin.com/WmuFMBd8
[11:41:10] <AntoineDTD> Could someone help me please ?
[11:44:12] <Uhkis> no we can not, until you tell us what the problem is
[11:46:35] <AntoineDTD> Uhkis > ok :) i put the problem in the pastie but i can put it here again :) i just did not want to spam here. My problem is when i click on the button i handle an ajax call for a PHP verification but the call is strange. I can see the call in dev tool, i can se the header with my param but i can't get any result no echo nothing... and worst the cal makes 3 differents calls one on the target php page and 2 on the index page with an e
[11:46:35] <AntoineDTD>  "blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control"
[11:50:13] <Uhkis> oh sorry, i stopped reading after the jquery code ended
[11:50:34] <AntoineDTD> Uhkis > No it's ok :) no problem that's already kind to help
[11:52:41] <Uhkis> the problem is that server you're posting to. it needs to accept requests from where you're posting from. in general requests need to be on the same domain
[11:52:58] <Uhkis> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS more info on that
[11:53:52] <AntoineDTD> yes i saw that on google but my problem is ajax was workign perfectly ... and i am on local server with EASY PHP DEV SERV
[11:54:28] <Uhkis> and the call to multiple pages is probably because lines #61 or #62 starts redirecting
[11:55:40] <Uhkis> the error clearly states that you're posting to some actual domain, probably because of the redirect on 61/62 in the php code
[11:56:00] <Uhkis> so check those for hardcoded address
[11:57:58] <AntoineDTD> ok i have to test more to find what s goin on
[11:59:14] <AntoineDTD> Thank you Uhkis
[12:11:35] <AntoineDTD> Uhkis => If the problem is on server side that mean i should have CORS error in any Ajax call we are ok ?
[12:11:58] <AntoineDTD> Because i ve just tested another ajax call and it's work perfectly ... no problem no error no multiple calls... just perfect
[15:38:53] <ezio> how can I enumerate, recursively, all the elements of an object and get a call back?
[15:39:07] <ezio> iterate over sorry
[15:39:13] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:39:23] <robertmaxrees> got some example markup?
[15:40:22] <robertmaxrees> ezio
[15:42:18] <ezio> I just mean in JavaScript.
[15:42:35] <robertmaxrees> got an example object then?
[15:42:56] <ezio> is there something like, $.forEach that ... recurses through an object
[15:42:58] <ezio> uhh
[15:43:03] <robertmaxrees> $.each()
[15:43:08] <robertmaxrees> though it's not recursive.
[15:43:11] <ezio> { foo: { bar: 42 } }
[15:43:48] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you'll need to recurse that yourself.
[15:43:51] <robertmaxrees> Not too hard luckily.
[16:01:31] <AntoineDTD> Hello guys, is it possible to identify if an element's html() is changing ? $el.on('change' ... is a trigger so it works only on an action from client. But how to detect changements into the element ?
[16:06:34] <robertmaxrees> You mean an input element's value?
[16:06:41] <robertmaxrees> AntoineDTD that's kind of an antipattern, for what it's worth.
[16:06:59] <AntoineDTD> no a div. For example let's imagine you wanna know each time a countdown is changing ?
[16:07:16] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you *can* do it, but it's not a good idea.
[16:07:20] <AntoineDTD> you wanna triggered each time countdown is changing
[16:07:36] <AntoineDTD> how can you do that ? :) even if it s a bad idea ? :)
[16:08:00] <robertmaxrees> it's not something you can do with jquery ;)
[16:08:19] <AntoineDTD> i thought it was just a $('mydiv').on('change', ... but not
[16:08:38] <Waldkauz> Why don't you add a handler to the thing that is changing the countdown?
[16:08:53] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:09:05] <AntoineDTD> Waldkauz if i could i wouldn t ask :)
[16:09:34] <AntoineDTD> imagin you have a marquee for example lol you get content but no access to script
[16:09:38] <robertmaxrees> is it not a page you own/maintain?
[16:09:51] <AntoineDTD> imaginE*
[16:11:58] <Waldkauz> Well, the thing you are looking for is MutationObserver
[16:12:22] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[16:12:36] <robertmaxrees> head to ##javascript if you want help with that :)
[16:12:57] <AntoineDTD> no it 's ok i just found :)
[16:12:57] <AntoineDTD> $('body').on('DOMSubtreeModified', 'mydiv', function(){
[16:12:57] <AntoineDTD>   console.log('changed');
[16:12:57] <AntoineDTD> });
[16:13:01] <AntoineDTD> works perfectly
[16:13:05] <AntoineDTD> thanks guys
[16:13:06] <robertmaxrees> please don't paste code here.
[16:13:08] <robertmaxrees> and don't use that.
[16:13:18] <AntoineDTD> sorry for the past
[16:13:25] <AntoineDTD> E*
[16:13:26] <robertmaxrees> AntoineDTD that's deprecated.
[16:13:31] <robertmaxrees> don't use DOMSubtreeModified
[16:13:41] <AntoineDTD> working on my serv ^^ ;Ã 
[16:13:55] <robertmaxrees> it's not going to work forever, and it's inconsistent between browsers.
[16:14:26] <AntoineDTD> if it's the only way to do it :)
[16:14:31] <AntoineDTD> no choice
[16:14:43] <robertmaxrees> but hey, if you want to come back here in a few months complaining about bugs and needing help, you call.
[16:14:46] <robertmaxrees> *your
[16:14:54] <robertmaxrees> or use mutationobersvers and do it the right nway.
[16:14:58] <robertmaxrees> *way
[21:44:24] <robertparkerx> how could I get the text of the li containing the anchor .next-submenu and place it in .parent-text https://jsfiddle.net/wzu9a1pt/
[21:44:39] <robertparkerx> well really just get the text on click is what I want to know
[21:44:48] <robertmaxrees> so which is it?
[21:44:49] <robertmaxrees> :)
[21:45:28] <robertparkerx> get the text of the li containing the anchor .next-submenu
[21:45:39] <robertparkerx> it should be Utrymningslarm
[21:46:15] <robertmaxrees> why not just render the html with a class on that LI in the first place?
[21:46:28] <robertmaxrees> instead of doing some kind of convoluted filtering process for it?
[21:47:12] <robertparkerx> I don't understand robertmaxrees
[21:47:48] <robertmaxrees> <li class="submenu-link-container">Utrymningslarm <a class="float-right next-submenu" href="#">></a>
[21:48:07] <robertmaxrees> now you just need to select $('.submenu-link-container') and do w/e :)
[21:48:49] <robertparkerx> I want the text so I can display it in the heading for the next paged-like sub-menu
[21:48:52] <robertmaxrees> or are you trying to get the text of the <li> when you click on the link?
[21:48:57] <robertparkerx> yes
[21:49:19] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.  very different request.
[21:49:27] <robertparkerx> is it .prev() ?
[21:49:30] <robertmaxrees> no.
[21:49:36] <robertmaxrees> .closest('li');
[21:49:41] <robertmaxrees> prev() is for siblings.
[21:50:03] <robertmaxrees> .closest() starts at the current element and then enumerates through all ancestors until you get a match.
[21:52:08] <robertparkerx> https://jsfiddle.net/wzu9a1pt/1/ it grabs all text
[21:52:37] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[21:52:47] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to exclude the text in the anchor?
[21:53:12] <robertparkerx> I just wanted Utrymningslarm for instance because it's next to the next-submenu
[21:53:24] <robertparkerx> I see why it is all now
[21:53:40] <robertmaxrees> wrap the label in a span like <span class="submenu-label">Utrymningslarm</span>
[21:53:46] <robertmaxrees> then .closest().find() it.
[21:53:47] <robertmaxrees> bam
[21:53:55] <robertparkerx> I just thought of that
[21:53:56] <robertparkerx> :D
[21:54:24] <robertmaxrees> heh
[21:54:49] <robertmaxrees> just be aware this isn't going to necessarily be the cleanest way to do this.  if you can, restructure this so you don't need to dynamically swap out titles like that.
[21:57:22] <robertparkerx> What would be the best structure
[21:57:38] <robertparkerx> I'm just trying to prepare for a task that is coming up
[21:57:49] <robertparkerx> I've never done a mobile menu like this
[22:00:25] <robertmaxrees> how many "levels" deep will the menu go?
[22:00:34] <sydbarret> i have 2 select option elements one for states and other for states. They are pulled from tables in db. Any code that display city based on state select?
[22:01:28] <robertmaxrees> sydbarret you could pretty easily render that server-side and then show the proper city dropdown based on what state is selected.
[22:01:31] <robertmaxrees> pretty trivial to dol
[22:01:35] <robertmaxrees> *do
[22:02:00] <sydbarret>  is that with jquery?
[22:02:18] <robertmaxrees> that question doesn't make sense lol.
[22:02:22] <robertmaxrees> is *what* with jquery?
[22:02:47] <sydbarret> dont start with paranoid questions
[22:02:51] <sydbarret> paste a sample code
[22:02:56] <robertmaxrees> lolno.
[22:02:59] <robertmaxrees> i'm not being paranoid.
[22:03:05] <robertmaxrees> your question doesn't make sense as phrased.
[22:03:11] <sydbarret> all i know is i have to use .change
[22:03:26] <robertmaxrees> so get the server-side portion figured out.
[22:03:27] <sydbarret> but i dont know how to recover data from db in jquery to populate city
[22:03:30] <robertmaxrees> render your dropdowns.
[22:03:40] <robertmaxrees> you don't use jquery to "recover data from db"
[22:03:42] <sydbarret> the dropdowns are already populated
[22:03:45] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[22:03:57] <sydbarret> im telling you im pulling them from table
[22:04:06] <sydbarret> but city should refresh
[22:04:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:04:10] <sydbarret> based on state
[22:04:24] <robertmaxrees> so you have one dropdown per state, right?
[22:04:25] <sydbarret> so if i choose tx it shouls appear houston, austin and so on
[22:04:32] <sydbarret> yes an another for city
[22:04:51] <sydbarret> and table database hase both columns
[22:04:53] <robertmaxrees> sorry - one city select dropdown for each state.
[22:05:01] <robertmaxrees> don't care about your DB necessarily.
[22:05:08] <robertparkerx> I guess this works https://jsfiddle.net/a05d7qvu/
[22:05:29] <robertmaxrees> sydbarret so you have 50 "city" select dropdowns, yes?
[22:06:12] <sydbarret> let me show you a pic
[22:06:19] <robertmaxrees> sydbarret code or nothing.
[22:06:23] <robertmaxrees> pictures are unhelpful :)
[22:06:35] <robertmaxrees> robertparkerx that's one way to do it, though you'll have to make that append logic a little more robust.
[22:06:52] <robertmaxrees> aaah nvm - i see what you're doing in that back button click.
[22:07:48] <sydbarret> so table is https://pasteboard.co/JevcoYi.png
[22:07:57] <robertmaxrees> i'm not clicking that :)
[22:08:18] <sydbarret>  thats my template https://pasteboard.co/JevcMlE.png
[22:08:37] <sydbarret> the table defines the set for each city based on state
[22:10:07] <sydbarret>  so i need something like this
[22:10:08] <sydbarret> $("#first-choice").change(function() {
[22:10:09] <sydbarret>   $("#second-choice").load("getter.php?choice=" + $("#first-choice").val());
[22:10:09] <sydbarret> });
[22:10:20] <sydbarret> but i dont know php
[22:10:20] <robertmaxrees> please don't paste code directly into the channel.
[22:11:05] <robertmaxrees> so yes or no: do you have all 50 city select dropdowns rendered onto the page at pageload?
[22:12:10] <sydbarret> they are not 50 cities
[22:12:14] <robertmaxrees> jfc
[22:12:24] <robertmaxrees> the dropdowns that contain the cities for each state.
[22:12:41] <robertmaxrees> so you'd have one "city" dropdown for each "state".
[22:13:00] <sydbarret> see the template pic
[22:13:04] <robertmaxrees> no thanks :)
[22:13:11] <robertmaxrees> doesn't really help answer any of my questions.
[22:13:13] <robertmaxrees> good luck!
[22:13:16] <sydbarret> im telling you i have
[22:13:22] <sydbarret> only the individual lists
[22:13:27] <sydbarret> on each dropdown
[22:13:30] <sydbarret> they are not related
[22:13:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:13:40] <sydbarret> the table is what relates them
[22:14:09] <robertmaxrees> i dunno how to help you when your tact is to ignore my questions :)
[22:14:15] <robertmaxrees> but hey, you do you :)
[22:14:30] <sydbarret> im explain ing you
[22:14:34] <sydbarret> but you dont understand
[22:14:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:14:38] <robertmaxrees> there it is.
[22:14:45] <sydbarret> show sample
[22:14:48] <robertmaxrees> 1: demand code.  2: insult people.
[22:15:02] <robertmaxrees> also: i can't "show sample" if I can't figure out wtf you're trying to do.
[22:15:16] <sydbarret> ok so whats your question
[22:15:20] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[22:15:33] <robertmaxrees> from what i can cobble together, you'd like to make some kind of ajax call to your server each time somebody selects a state?
[22:15:34] <sydbarret> do you know flask ?
[22:15:44] <robertmaxrees> nope.  and this wouldn't be the right place to talk about it anyway.
[22:15:48] <sydbarret> rogerts exactly
[22:16:02] <robertmaxrees> but also: if you're looking to do ajax like that, output json from the server for those calls.
[22:16:04] <robertmaxrees> not markup :)
[22:16:25] <sydbarret> so ajax is not jquery?
[22:16:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?  where did I say that.
[22:16:55] <robertmaxrees> you can do ajax using jquery.
[22:17:07] <sydbarret> ok yes you got the point
[22:17:08] <robertmaxrees> there's an entire $.ajax() even :)
[22:17:47] <Waldkauz> Completely unrelated comment: proper nouns should be capitalized :>
[22:18:02] <robertmaxrees> not helpful right now Waldkauz ;)
[22:18:09] <sydbarret> i send from the server in dictionary form which i think is similar to json
[22:18:16] <robertmaxrees> it needs to be in JSON.
[22:18:24] <robertmaxrees> javascript doesn't speak python.
[22:18:24] <sydbarret> yes i can convert it
[22:18:34] <robertmaxrees> you need to convert it server-side and send JSON.
[22:18:42] <sydbarret> yes and then?
[22:19:08] <robertmaxrees> so on change, send a get request via ajax with the state, return the city data to the client, and then render that into a dropdown.
[22:19:43] <sydbarret> yes those are 3 lines of code that you must have somewhere
[22:19:54] <robertmaxrees> lmao.
[22:20:04] <sydbarret> or in jquery
[22:20:05] <robertmaxrees> 1: it's more than 3 lines.
[22:20:10] <sydbarret> doc what should i for
[22:20:12] <sydbarret> look for
[22:20:20] <robertmaxrees> 2: just giving it to you doesn't help you learn.
[22:20:30] <sydbarret> i got the idea
[22:20:36] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/on/ event listener
[22:20:51] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ ahax
[22:20:52] <robertmaxrees> *ajax
[22:21:25] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery2 making elements :)
[23:08:56] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees still there?
[23:09:15] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[23:09:24] <robertmaxrees> can also just ask questions to the channel in general :)
[23:09:52] <sydbarret> in ajax what i post reaches to the server but as  empty
[23:09:55] <sydbarret> how can i trace it
[23:10:12] <robertmaxrees> how do you know that it's empty?
[23:10:26] <robertmaxrees> also: why are you using post instead of get? :)
[23:10:42] <sydbarret> i have to post the state chosen
[23:10:49] <sydbarret> so i can get the city in return
[23:10:57] <robertmaxrees> You can use GET for that.
[23:11:14] <robertmaxrees> which is much more appropriate given the action you're trying to take - but we can tackle that later.
[23:11:20] <robertmaxrees> relatively trivial change.
[23:11:34] <robertmaxrees> sorry - back to my original question: how do you know that it's empty?
[23:11:38] <robertmaxrees> can you share your code?
[23:11:47] <robertmaxrees> not a screenshot, but an actual paste of the code.
[23:12:21] <sydbarret> https://pastebin.com/iA1HUY4z
[23:12:49] <sydbarret> and on my server i have
[23:13:00] <sydbarret> @app.route('/get_city_for_state', methods=['POST'])
[23:13:07] <sydbarret> state_selected = request.json['data']
[23:13:11] <robertmaxrees> by the way - $(this).children("option:selected").val(); can literally just be $(this).val() :)
[23:13:33] <sydbarret> so when I choose it i get an error  on my server
[23:13:33] <robertmaxrees> so what's "empty" here?
[23:13:54] <sydbarret> in this line state_selected = request.json['data']
[23:14:02] <sydbarret> i get
[23:14:04] <sydbarret> TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable
[23:14:05] <robertmaxrees> well, yeah.  you're not necessarily posting json.
[23:14:12] <robertmaxrees> it's a form body.
[23:14:42] <sydbarret> so request['data'] would do_
[23:14:42] <sydbarret> ?
[23:14:50] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea how flask works.
[23:16:14] <robertmaxrees> even better, use a get request: https://dpaste.org/jy5f
[23:16:25] <robertmaxrees> then do  @app.route('/get_city_for_state', methods=['GET'])
[23:16:58] <robertmaxrees> and then request.args.get('selectedState')
[23:17:11] <robertmaxrees> if I'm reading this SO answer correctly.
[23:17:56] <sydbarret> and also i have to change the type to GET in ajaz_
[23:18:25] <robertmaxrees> yes - just like i did for you in that dpaste :)
[23:20:11] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees ok once i solve this and saying i have #city how do i populate the city?
[23:20:37] <robertmaxrees> you'll use .then() off the ajax call, pass it a function, and go to town from there.
[23:21:19] <robertmaxrees> the exact mechanics depend on how you ultimately formatted your JSON to get sent to the client.,
[23:21:41] <robertmaxrees> which is hopefully just a JSON array of citites.
[23:30:35] <robertmaxrees> get that ajax call working yet?
[23:31:23] <Waldkauz> No pressure, please
[23:31:42] <robertmaxrees> heh
[23:50:48] <sydbarret> robertmaxree got it working with POST
[23:50:55] <sydbarret> but im having trouble in the database end
[23:50:56] <robertmaxrees> lol k
[23:51:04] <robertmaxrees> oh, bummer. no clue how to help there.
[23:51:26] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees and to the code you paste the the 2 lines that are missing
[23:51:26] <robertmaxrees> i would head to a channel about flask/python to get help from there.
[23:51:36] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[23:52:02] <sydbarret> yes where does it return the cities as json in ajax
[23:52:11] <sydbarret> so i can populate the other dropdown
[23:52:19] <sydbarret> put a seudocode at least
[23:52:29] <robertmaxrees> you're confused :) - your server needs to return the JSON array of cities.
[23:52:42] <sydbarret> yes but to the ajax right?
[23:52:47] <robertmaxrees> and you don't "return" it out of the ajax - like I said, you use .then() and pass it a function to handle the data.
[23:53:07] <sydbarret> i dont know  what is .then()
[23:53:45] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax(/* your options here */).then(function(theDataFromTheServer) { /* handle the response data here */ });
[23:54:40] <robertmaxrees> the code that you use to transform the data from the server will go in that function.
[23:55:51] <sydbarret> the  "handle the response data here" is what i mean
[23:56:01] <robertmaxrees> can you be more specific?
[23:56:08] <robertmaxrees> you mean how do you turn it into html?
[23:56:34] <robertmaxrees> and put it into that dropdown?
[23:56:41] <sydbarret> yes
[23:57:07] <robertmaxrees> so earlier I said "the exact mechanics depend on how you ultimately formatted your JSON to get
[23:57:07] <robertmaxrees> sent to the client.,
[23:57:38] <robertmaxrees> ie I don't know what that code will look like without seeing the actual data you're sending back from your server.
[23:59:29] <robertmaxrees> also: continuously asking for "examples" or "psuedocode" for things like this is pretty counterproductive - you should focus on learning how to do this stuff yourself :)
