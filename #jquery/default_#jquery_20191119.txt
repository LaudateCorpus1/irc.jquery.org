[09:59:19] <dimi1947> Cork:are you here?
[10:38:51] <viniciusb> Hi
[10:52:32] <tona> Hello everyone, is there one way effient instead to use innethtml in javascript , my content is around one full page and I need to update it dynamically
[11:46:08] <dimi1947> ara ajax requests by definition async?
[11:46:45] <shoky> dimi1947: that is 99.99999% correct. so for all intents and purposes, yes
[12:32:03] <dimi1947> I was facing this problem https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24639335/javascript-console-log-causes-error-synchronous-xmlhttprequest-on-the-main-thr
[12:33:29] <dimi1947> I solved it with this code https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/2nvkg5tb/
[12:34:11] <dimi1947> so if all ajax requests are async than why use the code above to solve my problem
[12:34:59] <shoky> dimi1947: because this was the 0.000001% that is not async :(
[12:36:03] <shoky> best solution is to not let jquery parse html with <script> tags in it
[12:36:11] <dimi1947> first of all...are you familiar with the problem presented in stack overflow
[12:36:12] <dimi1947> ?
[12:36:30] <shoky> possibly..
[12:38:58] <dimi1947> so in other words you are saying not to use ajax request to load content from the server with script tags in it...is this what are you saying
[12:39:29] <dimi1947> ?
[12:39:34] <shoky> yes
[12:40:42] <shoky> either load simple html snippets ,  or e.g. JSON data
[12:43:35] <dimi1947> for some code to function though in the page where the content is loaded these scrcipt tags are needed...since JS files are imported with them
[12:44:08] <shoky> load it in the original page html
[12:44:13] <shoky> not through ajax
[12:46:23] <dimi1947> how...using a plain hyperlink for example?
[12:46:42] <shoky> <script>
[12:47:55] <dimi1947> shoky...add some details please
[12:51:43] <shoky> dimi1947: i just meant a regular <script src="file.js">  tag..
[12:51:54] <shoky> in the original page's html
[12:52:10] <shoky> instead of in the ajax response
[14:10:55] <dimi1947> I allready use script tags in my origginal HTML page...that is the weird thing...despite being there...the code in the imported(with AJAX) html...needs the script tags in the imported HTML..I hope you understood
[14:11:45] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 come again?  maybe try forming that as a question instead? :)
[14:12:52] <dimi1947> give me some time think it over how to formulate the above in a question...so to be clear enough
[14:13:26] <robertmaxrees> do you mean you're importing html via ajax, and that html has script tags that aren't running?
[14:14:28] <dimi1947> ...no...
[14:16:00] <dimi1947> give me a min
[14:21:34] <dimi1947> take a look at my original HTML first  https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/2nvkg5tb/ line 13(HTML goes in there) line 15,16 the srcipt tags
[14:24:30] <dimi1947> The HTML that gets imported has a search box...the handler for that box is found on sup_admin.js
[14:25:23] <dimi1947> in order for the handler to be functional the imported(with ajax) html MUST have the script tags...and that is the problenm
[14:26:17] <dimi1947> I must avoid putting script tags as we said in the imported HTML...it is needed though so that the search box is functional
[14:29:45] <robertmaxrees> what's your JS??
[14:36:37] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947
[14:39:07] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 because what you likely really want is a delegated event listener.
[15:01:26] <dimi1947> delegated event listener...???
[15:02:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah - you bind on an ancestor element that exists on pageload and then use a different signature for .on()
[15:02:11] <robertmaxrees> read https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events and https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[15:04:11] <robertmaxrees> and no, you can't *just* use .on() - you have to make some other minor changes, as well.
[15:12:23] * robertmaxrees plays the jeopardy think music
[15:15:33] <dimi1947> So..you are saying that If I use delegation there will be no need for using script tags in the imported HTML...is that correct?
[15:15:45] <robertmaxrees> no
[15:16:10] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying that using a delegated handler will solve your event binding issues.
[15:16:31] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what all of your code looks like so i don't know if there's other stuff going on in there.
[15:17:59] <dimi1947> we have to continue tommorow...I cannot continue now...I must leave...I hope you will remember the discussion tommorow
[15:18:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:18:18] <robertmaxrees> i probably won't :)
[15:18:23] <robertmaxrees> enjoy!
[16:41:53] <devslash2> how do you get the value of an option dropdown using $(this) in jquery
[16:41:58] <robertmaxrees> .val()
[16:42:35] <devslash2> thats not correct that doesnt work $(this).val() returns an empty string
[16:42:49] <robertmaxrees> lmfao
[16:43:12] <robertmaxrees> actually, it IS correct: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3yj1r94z/
[16:43:14] <robertmaxrees> show your code.
[16:43:31] <devslash2> console.log($(this).val())
[16:43:48] <robertmaxrees> what does your html look like?
[16:43:55] <robertmaxrees> what does your binding look like?
[16:44:22] <devslash2> I fugred it out
[16:44:23] <devslash2> this works
[16:44:24] <devslash2> $("option:selected", this).val()
[16:44:27] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[16:44:33] <devslash2> why not ?
[16:44:45] <robertmaxrees> if $(this).val() doesn't work, you have other issues you need to address.
[16:45:04] <devslash2> this also works: $(this).find('option:selected').text();
[16:45:15] <robertmaxrees> that's identical to your other version, but also not the same.
[16:45:23] <robertmaxrees> text() and val() are two different things./
[16:47:02] <robertmaxrees> *not the same as what you want.
[16:48:28] <devslash2> seems to work just fine
[16:49:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:50:04] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: okie. good luck :)
[16:57:04] <jiffe> I have a need to have a webpage with a fixed sized list and another 'grab bag' list with a set of items that I can drag in and out of positions in the fixed list, anyone know of a jquery plugin or similar that might do something like this?
[17:02:38] <robertmaxrees> google search shows a ton of options
[17:08:04] <jiffe> what are you googling for?
[17:08:28] <jiffe> I've looked at a number of options around sortables, none of which matched what I was looking for really
[17:08:44] <robertmaxrees> well, first off - does it have to use jquery?
[17:08:59] <robertmaxrees> 'cause https://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable/
[17:09:23] <jiffe> yeah that's one of the ones I looked at
[17:09:57] <robertmaxrees> i guess i'm unclear about your "fixed sized list"
[17:10:00] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean by that?
[17:10:53] <jiffe> I mean a list that shows say 10 empty spots that I can drag items into and out of to fill or create vacancies
[17:11:13] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you put in more than 10?
[17:11:25] <jiffe> not possible since there are only 10 spots to fill
[17:11:47] <robertmaxrees> so just do nothing?
[17:11:52] <robertmaxrees> return it back to the "source" list?
[17:11:58] <jiffe> yeah
[17:12:39] <robertmaxrees> very likely you'll have a hard time finding something that does that out of the box.
[17:14:28] <robertmaxrees> brb
[17:18:03] <robertmaxrees> back
[17:18:21] <robertmaxrees> so you'd need to configure it a bit, but that lib i linked should get you most of the way there.
[17:25:34] <jiffe> yeah I think I might be able to work with this
