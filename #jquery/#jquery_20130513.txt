[00:00:08] <Cork> and no style can't be done in html
[00:00:39] <Cork> <input style="display: none;"> or <input class="hide">
[00:02:11] <anze_031> ok so if i use style="display: none" so also it will submit the value of radio button
[00:02:28] <Cork> depends on the browser
[00:02:37] <Cork> ie won't submit hidden form elements
[00:03:05] <Cork> (hidden as in not visible none type="hidden" elements)
[00:03:40] <lemonsparrow> Cork: what would be the advantage of adding a form over it ? also how can I separate out the $("#pub").click(function()  from the  document.ready loop ?
[00:04:18] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you can't really separate out that section, as it has to run after you've added the form
[00:04:53] <Cork> lemonsparrow: among other things the form is needed for accessability tools, and for normal functionality of the browsers
[00:05:05] <lemonsparrow> Cork: so u mean it will have to be within the document.ready ? can't I bind it with anyother event or some other api? like window.load or something ?
[00:05:17] <Cork> there is no reason not to have the form, and plenty of reason to have it
[00:05:45] <lemonsparrow> Cork: but #justAdoubt my functionality now is workign fine across all browsers without form too ?
[00:05:54] <Cork> lemonsparrow: well you could have a callback solution where you define a callback handler and it's called from inside
[00:06:01] <Cork> but other then that; no
[00:06:16] <Cork> lemonsparrow: that depends on what you mean by works fine
[00:06:18] <lemonsparrow> Cork: could u show me that in my code itself.. would be explanatory
[00:06:32] <Cork> yes, clicking it with a mouse works, but every thing else about submitting it is broken
[00:06:36] <lemonsparrow> Cork: functionality works fine.. and I use firebug for accessibility of dom elements
[00:06:57] <lemonsparrow> Cork: u mean http request using other means ?
[00:07:04] <Cork> uh... accessibility is for ex. vision impaired users
[00:07:08] <Cork> not for dom inspection...
[00:07:20] <coldhead> poor enerel
[00:07:22] <coldhead> didn't get no loving
[00:07:53] <lemonsparrow> coldhead: oh k
[00:08:58] <anze_031> so tell me how can i hide radio button as well as whose value submitted to the form by jquery ?
[00:09:36] <Cork> anze_031: best way to submit a value if you don't want it visible is through a <input type="hidden"> field
[00:09:57] <anze_031> <input type="radio"?
[00:10:18] <Cork> <input type="hidden">
[00:10:23] <anze_031> how can i pass type="hidden"
[00:10:30] <Cork> just set it in the form
[00:10:33] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok lastly https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/5566379 given this code, what is the best way to move this submit method outside of document.ready? could u show me that callback example u mentioned on code ?

[00:13:05] <Cork> ah... i totally miss read that :x
[00:13:05] <tw2113> cat keeps knocking it over
[00:13:26] <Cork> i thought "why the hell are you pissing on your cat" :D
[00:13:51] <tw2113> i chased her briefly until i caught her, then threw her under the faucet in the tub for a moment
[00:13:59] <tw2113> if she's wanting water so badly

[00:18:06] <anze_031> thanks cork
[00:18:28] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you would have to define a deferred variable outside the ready (at the beginning there) and then create a promis, then fire that promis when you know the element has been added
[00:18:53] <Cork> and if things gets added after it's fired they will execute directly
[00:19:14] * tw2113 gives Cork $5 to go with that credit
[00:19:31] <tw2113> and a starbucks gift card
[00:19:36] <Cork> credit?
[00:19:57] <Cork> ah the link :D
[00:20:27] <Cork> well anze_031 didn't seam to know what he was doing at all...

[00:21:01] <Cork> that's a bit harsh
[00:21:25] <tw2113> yeah, i'm not happy with a cat, thus a bit moody
[00:21:30] <tw2113> and when in a mood, i get mouthy

[00:25:26] <coldhead> hahahah
[00:30:22] <tw2113> coldhead, could you explain to me again Schrodinger's API?
[00:31:23] <coldhead> sure, it always returns the data you need as long as you never call it
[00:31:37] <coldhead> it has to be sufficient to know that it would return the results IF you requested them
[00:31:45] <coldhead> but you can't actually request them
[00:31:48] <coldhead> that's a trap for young players

[00:44:35] <lemonsparrow> Cork: defined variable in line 1 https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/5566379
[00:47:32] <Cork> lemonsparrow: sorry forgot they have renamed the one i though if to callbacks
[00:47:37] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[00:47:51] <Cork> $.Callbacks( "once" ); is what you want
[00:47:55] <lemonsparrow> Cork: well something interesting... what is a js promise ? :)
[00:47:56] <motaka3> Cork: I still am wretelig with that problem
[00:48:10] <Cork> uh sorry and memory
[00:48:32] <Cork> lemonsparrow: it's basically a way to let you chain callbacks
[00:48:41] <Cork> lemonsparrow: and it's not part of js, its part of jquery
[00:48:46] <Cork> motaka2: what problem?
[00:49:07] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok thanks... how to add the callback for my submit function.. could u show me pls.. I am relatively new to js and jquery :( https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/5566379
[00:49:37] <Cork> var added = $.Callbacks('memory once');
[00:49:51] <Cork> and in after you've added the elements do added.fire();
[00:50:20] <Cork> and the code that needs to run after the elements has been added does added.add(function() { /* the dependent code run here */ });
[00:54:38] <lemonsparrow> Cork: is this correct ? look at line 1, 14, 15 and 34-43
[00:54:43] <lemonsparrow> Cork: https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/5566379
[00:55:09] <Cork> ya, that should work
[00:55:42] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok thanks :)
[00:56:09] <lemonsparrow> Cork:  $.Callbacks('memory once'); what is this memory once ? random name to identify callback ?
[00:56:51] <coldhead> it's quite poetric
[00:57:18] <Cork> lemonsparrow: read the documentation page
[00:57:27] <Cork> `api jQuery.Callbacks

[00:57:33] <clorith> I'm trying to "log" the DOM path of an object in an iframe (same domain), so far I've managed to make it all trigger and such on iframe interaction but for some reason my loop through the objects is turning up empty every time: http://jsfiddle.net/LZraB/
[00:58:19] <lemonsparrow> clorith: got it :)
[00:58:26] <lemonsparrow> Cork: got it
[00:58:54] <Cork> clorith: this is not part of the current document, i suspect that is what happens
[00:59:03] <Cork> though i would have to check to see though
[00:59:44] <clorith> Hmm, without a this how would one identify the clicked object though =/
[00:59:59] <coldhead> there is a good hurl album called "not a memory"
[01:00:03] <coldhead> just FYI
[01:01:15] <Cork> clorith: http://jsfiddle.net/LZraB/1/
[01:01:53] <clorith> you, my good sir, are a genious :D
[01:02:06] <clorith> Thanks, hadn't even thought of lookign into the content of the event it self in that way
[01:02:41] <Cork> clorith: also http://jsfiddle.net/LZraB/2/
[01:03:11] <Cork> you should always run preventDefault the first thing you do in an event handler (if you want it to stop the event)
[01:03:21] <Cork> else there is a risk that the event will fire before you stop it
[01:03:37] <clorith> Oh, I thought it'd never fire till the trigge rwas done running
[01:03:42] <clorith> Good to know, cheers =)
[01:04:05] <Cork> clorith: i've had that problem bite me more then once
[01:04:13] <Cork> mostly on submit events though
[01:05:18] <DRWhite> hi folks, I have an issue.. JQuery Mobile is not ini8tializing properly on page load at times. It gets stuck with a stuffed up layout.
[01:05:23] <DRWhite> Any way to fix?
[01:05:49] <coldhead> i'd be checking the html is valid first
[01:05:56] <coldhead> just an old junky hunch
[01:10:57] <motaka3> Hello using $.ajax I get some html content including several <script src="..."></script> , the problem is the html content itself contains some javascript code that it needs first thos <script>s to load. So I wonder how can I insert the html after thos <scripts> are functional
[01:11:23] <coldhead> put it in a separate JS file and do .getScript, motaka3
[01:11:37] <coldhead> JS in your HTML is >: |
[01:12:13] <Cork> and ya, jquery does some fiddeling with inline js too
[01:13:36] <motaka2> coldhead: No other way I can runt it in html content, the javascript comming in HTML is using some PHP enviromet variable to setup <script>s
[01:14:45] <coldhead> gross
[01:14:57] <coldhead> in that case you might have to put it in some other tag like <skript>
[01:15:11] <coldhead> or <script type="text/deferred">
[01:15:13] <ravenzz> Given something like this http://jsfiddle.net/3cH9q/ I need to define an order of importance for retrieving the target-id. is 1) this.hash 2) $(this).attr('data-modal') 3) $(this).data('modal').id a good one?
[01:15:19] <coldhead> or <p style="display:none">
[01:15:27] <coldhead> and then pull it out, stick it back in an actual script
[01:15:32] <coldhead> fortunately i have to go home now
[01:16:25] <Cork> ravenzz: $(this).data('modal').id isn't valid
[01:16:45] <Cork> that would be data-modal="{id: 1}"
[01:17:01] <ravenzz> well var data = $(this).data('modal') || {}; if (data.id) { }
[01:17:06] <Cork> ravenzz: $(this).data('modal-id') is data-modal-id
[01:17:18] <ravenzz> I know
[01:17:45] <ravenzz> Cork oh is data-modal="{id: 1}" legit?
[01:17:51] <Cork> yes
[01:17:55] <ravenzz> I mean will it be parsed into a js object?
[01:18:05] <Cork> or you might have to use escaped json, i don't remember
[01:18:10] <Cork> yes
[01:18:44] <clorith> So I just realised the iframe I'm trying to play aroudn wit his loaded in later, there's just a container div around it, which makes my click event not trigger at all on it, not even with .on()
[01:18:48] <clorith> gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
[01:18:52] <ravenzz> Cork only when I retrieve it with data() I guess?!
[01:19:26] <Cork> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/S65zY/
[01:19:34] <Cork> ravenzz: yes
[01:19:36] <ravenzz> Cork however I am more concerned about the relevance order... something like the css specificity
[01:20:03] <ravenzz> maybe the inline data attr should win over the href's hash
[01:20:15] <Cork> ravenzz: what relevance order are you talking about?
[01:20:40] <ravenzz> Cork the user could set the target id in different ways
[01:20:54] <Cork> then hash should always win
[01:21:06] <ravenzz> using a data- attribute or appending the hash to the href
[01:21:15] <acriax> Hi, I'm trying to identify the cause of a slow-loading page (unresponsive script). Chrome dev tools reports that the page has up to 5909 event listeners. Is this crazy much or does that sound like a normal amount?
[01:21:37] <Cork> acriax: crasy much
[01:21:42] <ravenzz> Cork k
[01:22:10] <Cork> acriax:  you're most likely useing a $(selector).event when you should be using a delegated event listener
[01:22:22] <ravenzz> Cork actually I am trying to enstablish a link between the triggers and the modal, do you think that it is a good way to do it?
[01:22:24] <motaka2> Cork: is this possible: <script type="text/deferred" src="..."></script>
[01:22:46] <acriax> Cork: I've been trying to use $(document).on('click', 'element', function{}) as much as possible though
[01:23:06] <ravenzz> I mean the Modal could be called (open) by anything that trigger uiModalRequested
[01:24:19] <Cork> motaka2: it causes the browser to no see the tag as javascript
[01:24:38] <motaka2> Cork: What about the src ?
[01:24:59] <Cork> acriax: still sounds like you're doing it somewhere
[01:25:47] <Cork> motaka2: if the script is external but you have it in the html, it won't EVER run before the html
[01:26:17] <acriax> Cork: Well, I checked a random complex-looking site on the net, and they had about 6800 dom-objects. This page has half a million. Think that might be part of the problem :P
[01:26:23] <Cork> motaka2: the script will load async, and the html will (unless it's crasy complex) always load before the js has even been grabbed from the server
[01:26:25] <motaka2> Cork: So what should I do, I am getting crazy it's the sixth day
[01:26:46] <Cork> acriax: dom objects != event listeners
[01:27:17] <Cork> damn...
[01:27:23] <acriax> someone tripped on the cord
[01:27:47] <Cork> motaka2: you only have one choice regex out the script from the html before you parse it
[01:28:05] <Cork> motaka2: then getScript it, and in the callback from that script call add the html to the page
[01:28:58] <motaka2> for each call I have several jsPaths
[01:29:43] <Cork> motaka2: and jsPaths is what loads the js or what?
[01:30:35] <motaka2> no lemme show you an example , may I PM you ?
[01:30:51] <Cork> i prob won't have time to look at it
[01:31:05] <motaka2> So I can't ?
[01:31:15] <Cork> it's no point
[01:32:43] <clorith> Is there a trick I can do when the <iframe> tag doens't exist to begin with on my page and it is added in after the DOM is ready, I've attempted $("iframe").contents().on('click', function() ); which doesn't trigger
[01:33:26] <Cork> clorith: you can't add event listeners to a document that doesn't exist, so no
[01:33:36] <Cork> and events doesn't bubble from one document to another
[01:35:17] <clorith> Hmm, seems that the iframe isn't added till everything else is done, I guess I could do a delay and check for it, if not found, try again until it's there
[01:35:41] <clorith> Not the very best approach, but doable as the delay shouldn't be more than a few milliseconds
[01:35:46] <Cork> that's racy
[01:35:58] <Cork> only safe option is to listen for the load event on the iframe
[01:36:20] <clorith> how would I do that when the iframe tag doens't exist to begin with though
[01:36:42] <Cork> you could have to add an event listener to the element before it's added to the page
[01:36:58] <Cork> so yes, you would have to track down where that happens, and most likely modify the code
[01:37:17] <Cork> but everything else will break depending on where it's loaded
[01:37:40] <clorith> yeha i know where it's loaded in, unfortunately editing that isn't an option
[01:38:23] <Cork> if you have a syncronus code flow from that point it could be safe to add the event listener from where you are
[01:44:01] <clorith> So I set up an interval
[01:44:06] <motaka2> Cork: on local machin it works but not on remote machine, on local in firebug I see request like:  http://localhost/currentweb/NoonDreams/plugins/cal/lang/calendar-en.js?_=1368433996543  but I dont see such a request in remote machine althogh on bot machines I see <script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"http:\/\/noondreams.com\/shared\/plugins\/cal\/jalali.js\"><\/script> returned as a json result
[01:44:22] <clorith> checks every 200 ms for my content (it works really well, the initial 200ms delay is all that was needed really)
[01:44:36] <clorith> although if you are having connection issues or whatnot it'll wait till the iframe is there
[01:44:54] <Cork> motaka2: might be server config
[01:45:05] <lejocelyn> is {} a valid json?
[01:45:09] <Cork> clorith: yuck, that is really horrible...
[01:45:15] <Cork> lejocelyn: yes
[01:45:29] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse('{}')
[01:45:31] <bot-t> Cork: {}
[01:45:39] <motaka2> clorith:  checks every 200 is my answer?
[01:45:42] <clorith> Cork: Unfortunately I'm not familiar wit hthe approach you were speaking of, I didn't know there was a way to wait for a dom object ot appear without a timer
[01:46:24] <Cork> clorith: you would have to find where the other code adds, it and get notified when it happens and from there bind a .load event on the iframe
[01:46:35] <Cork> motaka2: no it's a different matter
[01:46:38] <clorith> But I had to do it one way or another just ot test that it was possible to interact with this at all if I managed ot wait long enough before initiating the iframe selector
[01:47:12] <Cork> timers for things like this is not the solution; and especially not an interval
[01:47:31] <motaka2> Cork: So what should I do?
[01:47:51] <Cork> you can get congestion, so you trigger multiple times in a low
[01:47:53] <clorith> But how would I get notified of it hapenign without editing the edisting code that generates the iframe to begin with?
[01:47:57] <Cork> and it can be quite horrible
[01:47:57] <clorith> (as editing it isn't an option)
[01:48:23] <Cork> clorith: if the code adding it is that bad that it doesn't let you interact with it at all, you shouldn't use it
[01:49:05] <Cork> motaka2: you would have to check the responses, xss, headers
[01:49:18] <Cork> it's most likely in one of those places where it differs
[01:49:22] <motaka2> Cork: I prefer to sucide
[01:49:36] <Cork> ex you might have an old link to localhost left on the live site or something
[01:50:51] <clorith> Cork: Not sure if I can interact wit ht or not to be honest, I suspect I can't
[01:51:36] <Cork> then get it fixed, or replace it; just hacking around it is... not a nice solution
[01:52:04] <clorith> I know it isn't idea lto hack around anything at all
[01:52:12] <clorith> How would I know if this thing is interactive?
[01:52:22] <Cork> reading the code?
[01:53:02] <Cork> you should find code to handle callbacks or similar if it is written in a way worth keeping
[01:54:15] <lejocelyn> is there a way, when the user refreshes the page, to know what are the data that are put by the browser into the forms ?
[01:54:40] <Cork> lejocelyn: you would have to wait for load and check
[01:54:56] <Cork> and no there isn't an event specifically for that
[01:55:12] <Cork> and browser is sometimes picky about what it let you do with that data
[01:55:27] <clorith> yeah ok, this thing has no callbacks then, at least not for the iframe bit =/
[01:55:51] <lejocelyn> for instance, I do check data when the user focusouts on some forms, but it, during the registration process, the user refreshes the page, it could bypass some checks
[01:55:56] <Cork> is it adding it async, or can you handle it after the call to it?
[01:56:32] <Cork> lejocelyn: you could handle that though the page load event handler
[01:56:44] <lejocelyn> ah true
[01:56:46] <Cork> lejocelyn: also be sure to make an additional validation server side
[01:56:50] <clorith> it's async (hence why my previous attempts failed, as my js is loaded last of everything on the page)
[01:57:02] <Cork> you should never depend on js for securing the validity
[01:57:30] <Cork> clorith: the iframe content is async, yes, but that doesn't mean the adding of the iframe it self has to be
[01:57:46] <clorith> wait
[01:57:50] <lejocelyn> I do validation on the server side but I prevent the user to submit data if the data on the form aren't correct (email already on the database, etc.)
[01:57:50] <Cork> and what you need is access to the iframe before its content is loaded
[01:57:56] <clorith> this could possibly be a callback and i'm not realizing it
[01:58:06] <lejocelyn> same, on the server side
[01:58:15] <Cork> lejocelyn: good, just checking :)
[01:58:19] <lejocelyn> and same on the database constraints :)
[01:58:23] <clorith> https://gist.github.com/Clorith/5567046
[01:58:33] <clorith> would the e.resolveWith(d) be said callback or am I dumb
[01:58:42] <zulu-gula> what would be the best plugin for touch devices for jquery core 1.4.4?
[01:58:54] <Cork> clorith: yes, that is a deferred element
[01:59:03] <mazzachre> Is there somewhere where I can test a post in some way? (I need  to be able to use the post values of a form to generate a simple page, to test something)
[01:59:13] <Cork> clorith: e is what you want access to

[02:02:52] <lejocelyn> I really dislike the HTML multiple select form, any ideas how to have a better one ? I could do with checkbox actually

[02:03:42] <Cork> and a list of <input type="checkbox">
[02:03:44] <nickster> Hey everyone
[02:03:54] <nickster> I need some jquery help
[02:03:59] <Cork> (and <label>)
[02:04:05] <Cork> ?ask
[02:04:05] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:04:06] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:04:28] <lemonsparrow> Cork: is it necessary that the callback.add() code should be places above callback.fire() ? no ryt ?
[02:04:38] <Cork> no
[02:04:42] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[02:04:46] <Cork> that is the point of once and memory
[02:05:42] <nickster> I'm capturing the input of users as they type. and it's supposed to get into another function when they click a button that appears on a modal
[02:05:52] <nickster> but it just skips function
[02:06:09] <nickster> it enters it but does not capture the keypressess in the function
[02:06:33] <lemonsparrow> Cork: that is what I was abt to ask u.. I ready the flag description for once and memory but I got confused.. could u explain in simple sentence.. why we use memory and once from https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/5566379 this example perspective ?
[02:07:21] <Cork> lemonsparrow: 'once memory' means that if you use add before fire has been called, it's added to the queue list
[02:07:35] <Cork> if it's added after the fire is called, it's just called directly
[02:07:59] <lemonsparrow> Cork: then in my case https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/5566379 I am calling fire before add
[02:08:19] <Cork> no you're not
[02:08:30] <Cork> add happens before ready
[02:08:41] <soee> hi, is it possible to assign some function to container that will track changes in this container (for example some content is added into it) and if new content shows up inside container do some actions ?
[02:08:42] <Cork> your missing the async nature of events
[02:09:03] <nickster> https://gist.github.com/nicksterx/5567095
[02:09:03] <Cork> soee: no you can't; at least not cross browser
[02:09:09] <nickster> That's for my problem
[02:09:15] <nickster> Doesn't need to be cross browser
[02:09:23] <nickster> just chromium
[02:09:33] <Cork> ?p @ nickster
[02:09:33] <bot-t> nickster, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:09:41] <Cork> please make a working example
[02:10:00] <lemonsparrow> Cork: yeah I got it... I missed the document.ready part there.. I just looked at the order of code placement.. u r ryt.. document.ready will execute after add :) thanks
[02:10:03] <Cork> working in the form that ppl can see what the code and content is currently doing
[02:10:43] <Cork> lemonsparrow: but honestly, the point of that callback form is that it would work no-matter what order they're called
[02:10:57] <Cork> so it doesn't really matter
[02:11:18] <lemonsparrow> Cork: that's ryt but the only thing I was keen to understand was the flag part of callback.. memory once..
[02:11:33] <Cork> ryt?!?
[02:12:23] <lemonsparrow> Cork: right* (shortform)
[02:12:27] <lemonsparrow> Cork: :)
[02:12:32] <Cork> -_-'
[02:12:58] <lemonsparrow> Cork: and lastly wouldnt my code work as it is with var added = $.Callbacks(); instead of var added = $.Callbacks('memory once');   ?
[02:13:52] <Cork> lemonsparrow: it would but as i don't know where you intended to add the lower section (as you wanted to move it out of the ready section i took for granted you wanted it in another file)
[02:14:38] <lemonsparrow> Cork: no it is in the same file.. I put it just below the document.ready block.. so now it would look in order similar to this https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/5566379
[02:14:54] <Cork> uh...
[02:15:00] <soee> when documenting function if attribute might be of different types (string or array) how should i mark it? as {mixed} for example ?
[02:15:02] <lemonsparrow> Cork: look at line 1, 15 and 34
[02:15:10] <Cork> if you have it right there, why not just have it in the ready section instead??
[02:15:40] <lemonsparrow> Cork: u mean why not just put it inside document.ready itself  right ?
[02:15:45] <Cork> yes
[02:15:52] <zulu-gula> are gestures captured by jquery ui 1.10?
[02:15:53] <Cork> your adding a lot of overhead for no reason
[02:16:03] <lemonsparrow> Cork: that was how it was before.. my lead asked me to move it outside of the document.ready :D
[02:16:12] <Cork> -_-'
[02:16:19] <Cork> then tell you're lead it can't
[02:16:28] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I dont know why he wanted that.. he is offline too.. sometimes he behaves wierd.. I know
[02:16:31] <lemonsparrow> Cork: :D
[02:16:31] <Cork> cause it depends on the flow in it
[02:16:56] <lemonsparrow> Cork: are we losing something if we bring it outside of document.ready
[02:17:01] <Cork> lemonsparrow: adding a callback to call from the event to right be able to put it right after the event handler is just stupid
[02:17:17] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you're making the code complex for no reason what so ever
[02:17:33] <Cork> there is a cost, but that part is mostly memory
[02:18:02] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I know.. I will tell him I have done what he wanted.. ie bring it outside of document.ready but I have done something stupid for no reason :D
[02:18:17] <nickster> http://jsfiddle.net/Mx4Zv/
[02:19:04] <Cork> nickster: what happend to the js?
[02:19:40] <lemonsparrow> Cork: there is something wrong in ur sentence "adding a callback to call from the event to right be able to put it right after the event handler is just stupid"
[02:20:09] <nickster> @Cork I'm not sure I'm working on fixing it
[02:20:33] <lemonsparrow> Cork: pls correct ur sentence :D
[02:20:51] <Cork> adding a callback, to use it straight after the event handler, instead of moving it up 3 lines and have it in the handler is just stupid
[02:21:03] <Cork> lemonsparrow: and no don't take my sentence
[02:21:18] <Cork> you have to understand the problem and express it your self
[02:21:30] <noaXess> morning
[02:21:31] <Cork> else you have lost the argument before it has even started
[02:23:02] <noaXess> is do some data load over jquery, normal way.. on the data there is a iframe wich loads a MHT file... compressed html report file.. if the iframe is loaded and i navigat away from it, the iframe stay's on top but just in IE.. if i click then at the div where the content is loaded, the iframe goes away...
[02:23:37] <nickster> I'm trying to figure out how to run functions after completion of the first
[02:23:44] <nickster> I know jquery has deferred
[02:23:48] <nickster> but I'm not sure how to use it
[02:23:51] <Cork> noaXess: sounds like you have a rendering bug
[02:23:57] <nickster> and I've tried using a call back
[02:24:05] <noaXess> Cork: but where? IE?
[02:24:08] <Cork> yes
[02:24:19] <Cork> try the normal hacks and see if it helps
[02:24:21] <noaXess> hm.. how to make a workaround, instead of load the whole page
[02:24:36] <Cork> zoom: 1; fixes loads of bugs in ie
[02:24:37] <Cork> :)
[02:24:47] <noaXess> Cork: ?
[02:24:55] <Cork> it's usually the first thing i try adding to an element that bugs in ie
[02:25:00] <Cork> and most of the time it fixes it
[02:25:00] <lemonsparrow> Cork: i understood it.. let me correct ur sentence "adding a callback to call an event handler from the event instead of adding it directly inside the event block is so stupid "
[02:25:05] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ^^ correct ? :0
[02:25:25] <noaXess> Cork: so zoom is a normal element attribute? so add it to the iframe?
[02:25:46] <Chel> can anyone say, why i get this erorr when im tring to build jquery-ui ? https://gist.github.com/dee938f457a247b389bf
[02:26:02] <Cork> lemonsparrow: well i would prob rather argue that it makes the code complex for no gain
[02:26:21] <Cork> noaXess: its a css rule
[02:26:23] <lemonsparrow> Cork: yes it does.. and it breaks the flow and no additional benefit
[02:26:30] <noaXess> Cork: ok
[02:26:35] <Cork> and you might add it to the iframe, or to the div that doesn't render correct
[02:26:44] <Cork> where you need to add it might differ from bug to bug
[02:27:01] <Cork> lemonsparrow: exactly that is the point of it
[02:28:26] <lemonsparrow> Cork: but as per ur sentence.. isnt click() and eventhandler.. document.ready isnt an event handler at all
[02:28:50] <lemonsparrow> Cork: adding a callback, to use it straight after the event handler, instead of moving it up 3 lines and have it in the handler is just stupid... I just dont get it..
[02:28:53] <lemonsparrow> Cork: :-/
[02:29:00] <Cork> lemonsparrow: doc ready is an event handler + some more
[02:29:18] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok :)
[02:29:19] <Cork> it is a compatibility callback around domcontentloaded with load fallback
[02:29:34] <Cork> and a Callbacks() to make it trigger after the events has triggered
[02:29:52] <Cork> ?g mdn DOMContentLoaded
[02:29:52] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I think in ur sentence we need to assert more by adding handler ITSELF before is just stupid.. right  ? :)

[02:30:22] <Cork> lemonsparrow: i'm not going to dictate you're argument, frankly it is your problem
[02:30:42] <Cork> my part is just to cry over ugly hacks
[02:32:07] <nickster> anyone have tips on getting $document.keypress(function(){}); to work in multiple functions after each execution
[02:32:13] <lemonsparrow> Cork: hahaha.. was just having some good time with you.. chill :) thanks a lot for all ur help mate... learned a lot just by talking to u :)
[02:32:18] <nickster> of a function
[02:32:48] <Cork> nickster: call the functions in the inline function?
[02:32:53] <Cork> or what do you mean?
[02:33:00] <nickster> Mines a pretty ugly hack :(
[02:33:31] <freannrak> how come this doesn't submit my form? http://dpaste.de/OeTCb/
[02:35:11] <Cork> freannrak: try moving focus out of the select element
[02:35:49] <freannrak> Cork: I just discovered it was because I used hide() the save button
[02:35:51] <Cork> i never remember if select trigger change before blur or not
[02:36:12] <Cork> ah, ie?
[02:36:22] <freannrak> $('#change_language_button').hide();
[02:36:27] <Cork> it's the only one kinky about submit buttons as far as i know
[02:36:27] <freannrak> if I uncomment this, it works
[02:37:11] <noaXess> Cork: zoom doesn't solve it :(
[02:37:27] <Cork> noaXess: pity it was worth a shot
[02:37:52] <noaXess> Cork: yeah.. hint's are good ;).. try next.. with z-index
[02:38:04] <Cork> true :)
[02:39:42] <soee> what would be the best way to check if function argument is and array ?
[02:40:52] <noaXess> Cork: no chance.. hm.. convert mht to png will be nice ;)
[02:41:11] <Cork> :)
[02:41:27] <Cork> soee: $.isArray()
[02:41:36] <Cork> ?.isArray
[02:41:37] <bot-t> jQuery.isArray(obj): Determine whether the argument is an array. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isArray/
[02:41:57] <soee> ok thank you
[02:43:56] <soee> ok one more question what si the best way to throw some error ?
[02:46:13] <Cork> ?eval throw("error")
[02:46:15] <bot-t> Cork: uncaught exception: error Execution error in .
[02:46:24] <Cork> :)
[02:46:37] <Cork> if you actually want to throw execution error that is
[02:46:47] <Cork> else you prob want to have a callback solution instead
[02:47:12] <soee> Cork, what i want is to accepr only string or array
[02:47:24] <soee> if parameter is of different type than hrow some error
[02:47:35] <nickster> The call back solution doesn't really work
[02:47:43] <nickster> for me at least
[02:47:49] <nickster> I want the modal in the middle of it
[02:48:54] <soee> to check if parameter is a string i should use $.type( "test" ) === "string"
[02:48:56] <soee> ?
[02:50:01] <Cork> ?eval function b(a) { if(typeof(a) !== "string" && typeof(a) !== "object") { throw "wrong type"; } }; b(1)
[02:50:02] <bot-t> Cork: uncaught exception: wrong type Execution error in .
[02:50:23] <Cork> replace typeof == "object" with $.isArray
[02:50:48] <noaXess> checkout this.. inside a div i have this:http://paste.ubuntu.com/5660752/ in FF, clicking on the button does replace the content of the div (modulOutputName) correctly. clicking on the button in IE9, does show the new content, but the iframe with the mht report is still there, until i click inside the div itself, above the mht report, see screenshots before click: http://i.imgur.com/z0zPyKf.png, after click: http://i.imgur.com/hRwbXTy.png
[02:52:34] <soee> Cork, thank you
[02:53:00] <lolmaus> I've got an element's CSS styles set with jQuery. How do i remove those styles so that default styles from the CSS files are applied?
[02:53:50] <Cork> lolmaus: you can do that by setting an invalid value to the inline css
[02:53:58] <seutje> removeAttr('style')
[02:54:06] <noaXess> btw. above problem is in IE9 not in IE8.. seams any IE9, ajax, jqeury issue..
[02:54:07] <Cork> lolmaus: though most of the time it's better to use a class if you can
[02:54:18] <lolmaus> seutje, thank you
[02:54:26] <seutje> just blow em all out to space!
[02:54:33] <lolmaus> Cork, i'm resizing elements, can't use classes.
[02:54:57] <Cork> then do something like .css('height', '')
[02:55:00] <seutje> nothing a behavior() can't fix :P
[02:55:04] <seutje> JK!
[02:55:08] <Cork> <_<'
[02:55:15] <seutje> k, I'll go away, sry
[02:55:20] <Cork> seutje: have you heard of css variables?
[02:55:25] <Cork> (it's part of css4)
[02:55:39] <Cork> it will implement support for js in css :/
[02:55:41] <seutje> yeah, with the grossest syntax ever
[02:55:54] <seutje> u can already use calc()
[02:56:08] <seutje> `caniuse calc
[02:56:09] <b-ot> seutje: You can use calc() as CSS unit value with: Internet Explorer 9, Firefox 4, Chrome 19, Safari 6, and iOS Safari 6. http://caniuse.com/#search=calc
[02:56:09] <Cork> no i meant var-js: alert("hello");
[02:56:21] <seutje> oh what?
[02:56:26] * seutje barfs
[02:57:11] <Cork> seutje: and then you do eval(el.style.var.js)
[02:57:21] * seutje runs away screaming
[02:57:41] <seutje> that + web components and debugging a silly syntax error will now take 3 weeks

[02:59:18] <zulu-gula> I would like to change html of dynamically loaded element, it's ajax loader

[02:59:36] <Cork> noone will ever find it!

[03:06:06] <Cork> the spec ya
[03:06:19] <Cork> but the announcement came two days ago
[03:06:49] <Cork> so browsers are now required to implement support from blocking the user
[03:07:10] <Cork> so the user agent has became a double agent
[03:23:44] <lolmaus> What's the simpliest way to convert a number to percentage? E. g. `.75` -> `75%`?
[03:24:17] <Cork> ?eval Math.floor(.75 * 100) + '%'
[03:24:18] <bot-t> Cork: "75%"
[03:24:51] <Cork> you could prob do (.75 * 100) + '%' too
[03:24:58] <Cork> ?eval (.75 * 100) + '%'
[03:24:58] <bot-t> Cork: "75%"
[03:25:37] <Cork> ?eval (.7555 * 100).toFixed(2) + '%'

[03:25:41] <Cork> ?eval (.7555 * 100).toFixed(0) + '%'
[03:25:42] <bot-t> Cork: "76%"
[03:25:48] <Cork> lots of ways :)
[03:26:49] <lolmaus> So there's no built-in function for that neither in Javascript nor in jQuery?
[03:27:41] <Cork> why would there be?
[03:27:57] <Cork> can't be much more compact then (variable * 100) + '%'
[03:30:10] <lolmaus> Cork, well, it's kinda common task
[03:30:18] <Cork> not really
[03:30:35] <Cork> it is on some pages, but most pages never need it
[03:30:57] <Cork> as it is only for presentation
[03:31:21] <caddoo> basic question about jQuery objects, I have this snippet of code here, http://www.pastey.org/view/c5c8666d
[03:31:31] <caddoo> the return doesn't contain the style attribute 'background' how comes?
[03:31:59] <Cork> you're returning the content of the div, not the div
[03:32:11] <caddoo> oh yes
[03:32:23] <Cork> and also if that is all you need, just create a plane string instead
[03:32:28] <caddoo> ok
[03:32:34] <Cork> as you're using the string form anyway
[03:41:22] <CausaMortis|zZz> hi, iḿ trying to insert json into a page before it is loaded. Using document.delegate() and the pageshow event I can execute the ajax needed to fetch my data but for some reason the jquery mobile styling is not applied
[03:41:35] <CausaMortis|zZz> im working with phonegap and jquery mobile. Any suggestions?
[03:42:08] <charl-oc> dont do it
[03:42:26] <charl-oc> jquery mobile with phonegap = quite slow
[03:42:46] <CausaMortis|zZz> Ive been told
[03:42:48] <charl-oc> slower than jquery mobile on a mobile website
[03:42:57] <CausaMortis|zZz> dont have the time to make it differently
[03:43:15] <CausaMortis|zZz> and the resources I find on building phonegap applications are rubbish
[03:43:29] <charl-oc> Phonegap is fine
[03:43:32] <charl-oc> we use it alow
[03:43:36] <charl-oc> alot
[03:43:56] <CausaMortis|zZz> well, could you perhaps point me to a decent resource that explains how to build a phonegap application
[03:44:00] <CausaMortis|zZz> i didnt come here to start a flame wark
[03:44:02] <CausaMortis|zZz> war*
[03:44:34] <charl-oc> http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.7.0/guide_getting-started_index.md.html#Getting%20Started%20Guides
[03:44:52] <charl-oc> with that you should have a sample app running in less than an hour
[03:45:25] <charl-oc> at the left there is the API reference which explains with samples for almost every platform it supports
[03:45:40] <CausaMortis> ive the docs, they arent very useful to me
[03:45:53] <charl-oc> what dont you get right?
[03:46:33] <charl-oc> ...and for what platform are you trying to dev?
[03:46:47] <CausaMortis> I dont understand how the navigation works, I dont feel like writing the javascript and css for things like side panels etc
[03:46:59] <CausaMortis> and it doesnt tell me anything about handling the ajax requests
[03:47:41] <CausaMortis> any platform supported by phonegap. I just need it to simulate a native environment
[03:47:47] <CausaMortis> all the data is fetched from a remote webserver
[03:47:48] <charl-oc> Phonegap only gives you access to native features, for layouting etc, you can use jquery mobile (if you want)
[03:48:02] <charl-oc> Ajax you can do normally with Jquery
[03:48:12] <CausaMortis> well im using jquery mobile
[03:48:29] <CausaMortis> and the styling is not applied when I fetch the json
[03:48:44] <CausaMortis> sec, setting up my laptop :) so you can see some of the code
[03:48:58] <charl-oc> Do you build uis from data you get with ajax calls?
[03:49:14] <CausaMortis> yes but im not depending on the ajax navigation system
[03:50:10] <charl-oc> okay, so you probably see your data, it just doesnt look right, right?
[03:50:40] <CausaMortis> correct :) it seems like the data isnt loaded early enough or vice versa
[03:51:06] <CausaMortis> i can see it, but, for example, generating a listview doesnt apply styling
[03:51:23] <charl-oc> nope, im sure you have it right, you probly just forget to tell jqm to make a "widget" from your data
[03:51:48] <charl-oc> example you have to do something like $("ul").listview("refresh");
[03:52:02] <charl-oc> which will then reapply the styling to your new listitems you added
[03:52:09] <CausaMortis> I remember trying that last night :) lets see if that works
[03:53:27] <charl-oc> You might also want to add them hidden to the dom, then refresh it, and then display it, else you might see some flashing
[03:57:14] <charl-oc> here is (what i think) is a nice example of data retrieved from ajax, and added to the page, its page we did for a univercity mobile app http://nimo.opencollab.co.za/mdot/wp/wapad/news
[04:00:10] <CausaMortis> cheers :) appreciate your input
[04:00:14] <CausaMortis> <- on phone atm
[04:00:20] <charl-oc> cool, have fun

[04:56:43] <texinwien> http://jsfiddle.net/Vn9Pn/ - what am I forgetting here?
[04:57:04] <texinwien> I set the input value with .val(), then submit the form, the input's value isn't submitted with the form.
[05:01:01] <ENK|2> if I put $("a[href $='.jpg']") I get <a href.....jpg> how I get <a href="http://youtube.com/....zzz> ?
[05:01:31] <ENK|2> I try $("a[href $='.youtube.com']") but not work
[05:05:31] <seutje> ENK|2: read the docs, [foo$=] is for "ENDS WITH"
[05:05:42] <seutje> use *= for "contains"
[05:07:13] <ENK|2> ok thanks $ end * begin
[05:09:37] <seutje> texinwien: spec says disabled input elements cannot be "successful" which means they aren't valid for submission
[05:10:03] <seutje> texinwien: see http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.12.1 && http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#successful-controls
[05:10:13] <texinwien> seutje - right, noticed that just now. thanks for pointing it out.

[05:22:21] <jedrek> now that as of 1.8 jQuery.load() is deprecated, what's the replacement?
[05:24:03] <sacho> have you checked the docs?
[05:24:14] <xec_> jedrek: .on("load", ...) ? :P
[05:24:47] <jedrek> so it's just the shortcut that's been deprecated?
[05:25:52] <jedrek> sacho: believe it or not, that's where i found out it's deprecated
[05:27:49] <koneko> afaik all shorthand event methods are being gradually moved to .on(event, fn)
[05:28:11] <koneko> and that's probably what's the deprecation about
[05:28:38] <sacho> "This method is a shortcut for .on('load', handler)." from the docs.
[05:29:58] <koneko> Exactly

[06:09:58] <zissou> im trying to post .html() to another page
[06:11:21] <zissou> if i put that string in an object and alert its property it outputs the html
[06:11:49] <redshark50> Hello all
[06:11:51] <zissou> but dont know how to pass it to .post(). when i access the $_POST on the target page id shows just byteArray()
[06:13:15] <zissou> do i have to define data types somewhere, or encoding, or mime type ? im stuck
[06:13:24] <redshark50> I've been using .remove() with jquery 1.6 and on upgrading to jquery 1.9 .remove seems to have stopped working
[06:13:34] <redshark50> any ideas?
[06:13:37] <zissou> a shove in a right direction would be much appreciated
[06:14:54] <zissou> redshark50, probably a PEBKAC. it should work
[06:42:11] <jo_> 'morning #jQuery.
[06:55:02] <TheWarden> Hi, I have the following code that on a keydown event for this given form field it captures the key code and if its 9 (tab key) then change form field focus to a specified form field. This code does work as it does change the form field focus but not the the form field I've asked it to focus on. It always focuses on the form field below
[06:55:17] <TheWarden> the one I wanted it to focus on. How can I fix this?
[06:55:22] <TheWarden> https://gist.github.com/thewarden/bd64628de54a62cf3ed4
[06:59:06] <TheWarden> The one thing I've just noticed is, if I tell it to set focus to the form field above I then will get the form focus on the one below which in this case is what I require. However, why is this behavior occurring? Shouldn't the focus go to the form field I'm telling it to go to?
[07:04:01] <Mottie> @TheWarden: Try setting the elements tabindex attribute instead
[07:07:00] <TheWarden> Mottie: So your saying that I need to define the tabindex first on the form element and then the focus() should work?
[07:07:34] <Mottie> @TheWarden: nope, you won't need the focus() code then
[07:08:30] <Mottie> @TheWarden: here is a reference: http://webcheatsheet.com/HTML/controll_tab_order.php
[07:09:38] <TheWarden> Mottie: well I think in this case I will still need to use focus() as I'm creating a loop to make it easier and quicker to input data. I don't believe there is a way to create a loop using the tab index attribute.
[07:11:31] <Mottie> @TheWarden: well it does loop, but the loop includes the browser controls as well... in that case you'll need to capture the tab on "keydown" and prevent default
[07:12:13] <Mottie> TheWarden: event.preventDefault(); somewhere in the code
[07:13:09] <Mottie> TheWarden: also in your snippet, you don't need to check the keyCode, jQuery normalizes event.which, so just check that
[07:15:16] <Mottie> TheWarden: I added a comment to your gist
[07:17:22] <aphperson> I am trying to make a little container to slide (or animate?) all of my divs (containing images) across from one side of the container, then existing out the left side.  Is there anyone who could point me in the right direction of what I am actually looking for in terms of jquery?
[07:17:33] <TheWarden> Mottie: oh okay, thanks that works great now.
[07:18:20] <TheWarden> Mottie: so I'm not sure I entirely understand this. Why must I do event.preventDefault(); in order to get the focus to the correct form field?
[07:18:51] <Mottie> TheWarden: that prevents the default functionality of the tab key (choosing the next tabindex)
[07:20:37] <TheWarden> Mottie: Oh I see so when I try to send it to something else it messes that up and may send it to the wrong form field like I was experiencing. Okay, I get it now. Thanks for the help.
[07:20:55] <Mottie> TheWarden: No problem! :P
[07:21:24] <ruby_on_tails> does anyone got any clue if jquery can animate pseudo elements ?
[07:25:51] <gxl> Is it possible to use jquery to fetch a block of html (specific element and children) from an external page, then append it to an element on the current page?
[07:26:46] <BillCriswell> ruby_on_tails: This goes into things pretty clearly: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5041494/manipulating-css-pseudo-elements-using-jquery-e-g-before-and-after
[07:27:06] <BillCriswell> gxl: external as in on another page on your site or another page on a different site?
[07:27:11] <shadyKhan> does anyone have experiance with jquery cookie?
[07:27:37] <BillCriswell> shadyKhan: What's the situation?
[07:28:05] <shadyKhan> let me pastebin it really quick BillCriswell
[07:28:31] <shadyKhan> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/8Dr98/
[07:28:45] <shadyKhan> i have the cookie on null at start on click of a button it changes it to true but when i refresh the page it goes back to null
[07:28:50] <Mottie> gxl: Check out the load() function: http://api.jquery.com/load/#loading-page-fragments
[07:29:00] <BillCriswell> shadyKhan: unquote null.
[07:29:09] <gxl> BillCriswell: Yes, within my own site. Trying to accomplish an ajax like request without a server side component. I have a list of news. When headline is clicked, I would like it to fetch the chunk of markup for the news, then append it to a element on the page that I am on already without a page redraw.
[07:29:21] <BillCriswell> or just do if($.cookie('SpashVisit'))
[07:29:37] <BillCriswell> I mean if( ! $.cookie('SpashVisit'))
[07:30:02] <gxl> Mottie: Will check it out. Thank you.
[07:30:04] <BillCriswell> gxl: $('.container').load('/other.html #foo ul')
[07:30:10] <shadyKhan> BillCriswell: ill try it out thanks
[07:30:16] <BillCriswell> shadyKhan: No problem!
[07:32:02] <TheWarden> What is the best way to add a new row with data to a table?
[07:34:31] <Mottie> TheWarden: that question is too vague - data from where? where is the row added? how many rows?
[07:35:25] <TheWarden> Mottie: The data for the new row would be taken from three form fields and it would only be one row added at a time. The row would be added to the end of the table.
[07:37:28] <TheWarden> btw, in this use I'm doing there is only one going to be one tbody tag
[07:38:36] <TheWarden> I'm thinking something like this, $('#myTable > tbody:last').append('<tr>...</tr><tr>...</tr>'); but I'm not sure if that is the best approach.
[07:38:52] <BillCriswell> TheWarden: You don't need :last
[07:39:07] <TheWarden> mmm except that has more than one row, I would only need one.
[07:39:15] <TheWarden> BillCriswell: Oh?
[07:39:59] <BillCriswell> If there's only one tbody like you said then last is useless. The .append() will automatically add it before the end of the tbody.
[07:40:11] <TheWarden> or should I be doing something like $('#myTable'.find('tbody').append('<tr><td></td><td>....</tr>');
[07:40:27] <theresajayne_> I am having problems getting UI tabs workging, any suggestions http://jsfiddle.net/Xfz4s/
[07:40:28] <BillCriswell> Splitting hairs at that point.
[07:40:54] <BillCriswell> $('table tbody').append('<tr><td>foo</td</tr>') would be fine.
[07:40:55] <Mottie> TheWarden: one sec, I'm making you a jsFiddle
[07:41:16] <theresajayne_> http://jsfiddle.net/Xfz4s/1/
[07:41:24] <theresajayne_> saw an error still no luck
[07:42:48] <Mottie> TheWarden: try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/RpqrG/
[07:43:24] <Mottie> TheWarden: I used $('table > tbody') in case you have nested tables... just remove the ">" if you don't
[07:43:50] <theresajayne_> this is frustrating, even the examples are not working http://jsfiddle.net/59X2s/
[07:44:29] <theresajayne_> hmm works in 1.9 but not the version we use....
[07:44:38] <Mottie> theresajayne_: those fiddles aren't loading jQuery or jQuery UI
[07:44:51] <TheWarden> Mottie: okay, thanks.
[07:45:00] <BillCriswell> theresajayne_: You need UI. http://jsfiddle.net/59X2s/2/ Here you go.
[07:45:04] <Mottie> TheWarden: no problem!
[07:57:40] <stygyan> hello
[07:57:43] <wad3> Good morning. I'm having a jQuery issue and could use some help. We're sending an encrypted cookie back server-side to be decrypted to then display the logged in user some data from our internal database. When making the call you can see the cookie being sent in the ajax call, server response gets a '200' but never is able to read the cookie.
[07:58:52] <pachet> sounds like a backend problem
[08:01:56] <wad3> Not an issue with having to make a cross-domain request?
[08:02:19] <mac_nibb1et> Anyone here using select2 ?
[08:02:43] <mac_nibb1et> It's going absolute nuts for me giving me a height of 30000px on the mask element
[08:02:50] <Z3R0> wtf...
[08:03:05] <Z3R0> why 30,000px ?
[08:03:14] <mac_nibb1et> that what i want to know :)
[08:03:24] <Z3R0> oh it's going nuts
[08:03:32] <Z3R0> thought it was going nuts BECAUSE you set the height to 30000px
[08:03:41] <mac_nibb1et> ha
[08:03:45] <Z3R0> I was like... uh change it ?
[08:05:06] <mac_nibb1et> OH SCrew me sideways
[08:05:16] <mac_nibb1et> i forgot rel="stylesheet" on the link for the css
[08:05:28] <Tygerr> can anyone help me with a warper for my jquery ui slider?
[08:05:49] <Mottie> warper?
[08:05:55] <mac_nibb1et> wrapper*
[08:06:04] <Tygerr> yeah typo

[08:09:59] <zulu-gula> how can I stop this animation?
[08:13:45] <d0100> getting an iframe´s content() is very problematic... $("#frame").contents().find('*') doesnt return anything, only when called inside a click() event
[08:14:38] <Mottie> d0100
[08:14:48] <Mottie> d0100 make sure the iframe is loaded first
[08:15:09] <d0100> it´s inside a  $("#frame").ready()
[08:16:05] <Mottie> d0100: shouldn't that be "load()" instead of "ready()"?
[08:16:38] <d0100> if its ready isnt it loaded?
[08:18:16] <d0100> logging to console find(´*´) returns <html>, <head> and <body>
[08:18:23] <d0100> instead of every element
[08:20:34] <Mottie> d0100: don't take my word on this, but I'm pretty sure you'll need to use load... ready usually just means the dom is loaded, but I don't think it's optimized for iframes
[08:21:11] <d0100> indeed
[08:21:13] <d0100> works now
[08:21:17] <d0100> wierd
[08:22:40] <dcherman> d0100: you're using the parent page's jquery on an iframe with .ready()?
[08:23:15] <d0100> yeah
[08:23:20] <d0100> but changed it to load
[08:23:23] <d0100> now it works
[08:24:00] <dcherman> d0100: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L799-L821 - that's why it doesn't work and load does.   you'd have to load a separate version of jQuery in the iframe for .ready to work.
[08:24:46] <d0100> oh, good to know, thanks

[08:40:39] <dannyzb> thats the header , thats where all the loading happens

[08:44:12] <dannyzb> in chrome *
[08:47:18] <d0100> dannyzb, I would start by only calling some scripts

[08:47:33] <d0100> dannyzb, and adding one by one
[08:47:44] <dannyzb> I don't even use those scripts
[08:47:45] <lyaer_> $('ul.files').on('click'   works, but $('ul.files li').on('click'  do not
[08:47:52] <dannyzb> they were piled on by the theme
[08:48:01] <dannyzb> would have a hard time adding one-by-one
[08:49:05] <d0100> Im guessing the .button is from jquery UI?

[08:58:28] <Z3R0> you didn't load a library
[08:58:29] <Z3R0> ;)
[09:00:36] <redshark50> 1.9.1, it's loaded elsewhere
[09:00:53] <Z3R0> yea, just saying you didn't load it in the fiddle
[09:01:00] <redshark50> rgr
[09:01:05] <Z3R0> btw, isn't live deprecrated in 1.9.1 ?
[09:01:16] <Z3R0> I think they switched to .on()
[09:02:06] <redshark50> sweet, will give it a go
[09:02:07] <Derimagia> Z3R0 live was deprecated in 1.7, removed in 1.9 yeah
[09:02:29] <myosotis> jQuery('selector_for_element_that_already_exists').on('click', 'selector_for_element_that_is_dynamically_created', function() {});
[09:02:33] <Z3R0> yea so if he's using live() in 1.9.1 then he'd have to switch it to .on()
[09:02:36] <myosotis> to replace .live
[09:02:49] <redshark50> bang. thanks chaps!
[09:03:08] <Z3R0> :)
[09:03:31] <redshark50> if only I'd known about this channel 6 months ago :)

[09:07:19] <dannyzb> can the foundation js library interfere with jQuery?
[09:08:48] <goddard> has anyone gotten google maps to load off an ajax call?
[09:09:03] <goddard> http://jsfiddle.net/gTqs3/
[09:27:22] <Vasa> is there a neat way (without simpley putting if within the event itself) to disable a certain event temporarely such as 'resize'  such as this one:$(window).on("resize", document, function(){
[09:27:58] <Vasa> like simpley disable the whole 'resize' branch?
[09:30:24] <islalobo> Hello, I am using the jquery maphilight module for a drupal site to create a map and a list of content that when the user mouses over the image or the list item a part of the image highlights. I can get the image to highlight, but when I try to use the same coordinates to allow the list item highlight the same are it will not highlight
[09:30:36] <NoiseEee> Vasa: no, you have to cancel the event via listener / the event itself
[09:30:46] <islalobo> You can see the code we are using here: http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/72313/using-js-maphilight-module-and-trying-to-trigger-a-hilight-from-an-external-ele
[09:31:12] <Vasa> NoiseEee: do you think putting the event to the state of OFF and then back ON would be an overkill compared to the other way of just placing an IF ?
[09:31:46] <islalobo> Here is the documentation I was following for the jquery plugin to allow mouse ober trigger from an external element http://davidlynch.org/projects/maphilight/docs/demo_simple.html
[09:34:15] <clov3r> islalobo: what's the js code?
[09:34:21] <islalobo> ^^ Anyone?
[09:34:54] <islalobo> Ah!  clov3r
[09:35:00] <islalobo> one second
[09:36:57] <islalobo> clov3r https://github.com/kemayo/maphilight/tree
[09:37:25] <clov3r> islalobo... no... what's YOUR js code look like?
[09:39:53] <islalobo> clov3r I don't have any of my own. My knowledge of jquery is limited so I installed a module to implement the maphilight jquery plugin and I added the plugin to my libraries. I followed the documentation of the plugin in all the steps I have taken. The only code that we have is a bit of html http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/72313/using-js-maphilight-module-and-trying-to-trigger-a-hilight-from-an-external-ele
[09:41:13] <islalobo> The code to implement the trigger of a highlight from an external trigger is posted in the documentation, but I am not sure what to do with that
[09:41:21] <islalobo> The documentation is here: http://davidlynch.org/projects/maphilight/docs/demo_simple.html
[09:44:43] <dannyzb> how do I check if jQuery is defined twice?
[09:47:28] <BillCriswell> dannyzb: Not sure you could...
[09:47:34] <wer0ckz> Help please. I'm using window.clipboardData && clipboardData.setData - textarea linebreak is not working on IE. FireFox works fine. Please see my jsfiddel: http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/tBhD4/
[09:47:49] <dannyzb> I'm using Zurb Foundation + jQuery/UI + drupal
[09:47:55] <dannyzb> and for some reason they all butcher eachother
[09:47:57] <dannyzb> no idea why
[09:48:06] <BillCriswell> What kind of error are you getting?
[09:48:50] <dannyzb> all sorts of them
[09:48:53] <Mottie> dannyzb: you can check to see if window._$ is defined
[09:49:01] <dannyzb> it is
[09:49:05] <dannyzb> well thats the wierd thing
[09:49:15] <dannyzb> drupal adds jquery.js and so does foundation
[09:49:32] <dannyzb> when I remove the drupal jquery.js all my functions say jQuery is not defined
[09:49:38] <dannyzb> and it actually is included !
[09:49:52] <wer0ckz> Help please. Line break issue for IE only. Please see my jsfiddel: http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/tBhD4/ - Screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/7jgvh5ixp/
[09:49:53] <Mottie> dannyzb: so you are loading more than one copy
[09:50:05] <dannyzb> The moment I remove the second copy everything breaks
[09:50:08] <dannyzb> it's bizzare
[09:50:47] <Mottie> dannyzb: when you load a second copy of jQuery, all the plugins loaded between the first and second are associated with the first copy.
[09:51:04] <dannyzb> I know ...
[09:51:13] <dannyzb> Thats why I'm trying to remove the second one
[09:51:44] <Mottie> Add a conditional
[09:52:22] <Mottie> dannyzb: use something like this instead: <script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="js/jquery.min.js"><\/script>')</script>
[09:53:06] <BillCriswell> wer0ckz: Try \r\n instead of \n\r
[09:53:39] <islalobo> any ideas? clov3r?
[09:54:59] <Mottie> wer0ckz: clipboardData isn't supported cross browser, have you looked into using zeroclipboard (https://github.com/jonrohan/ZeroClipboard)?
[09:55:15] <clov3r> so islalobo, you have the jquery code active?
[09:55:59] <clov3r> as on the demo page?
[09:57:09] <wer0ckz> <BillCriswell> wer0ckz: Try \r\n instead of \n\r <- which part should i insert \r\n ?
[09:57:32] <islalobo> clov3r should I add that code directly to the page? or the jquery plugin?
[09:57:43] <BillCriswell> Actually, try pasting into something besides notepad.
[09:58:22] <wer0ckz> it works on notepad++ but notepad.exe there's a linebreak issue
[09:58:27] <wer0ckz> can it still be fixed?
[09:58:34] <clov3r> well not directly... you should edit it to reflect your own page structure
[09:58:47] <clov3r> but you can put it anywhere that it'll be executed
[09:59:25] <clov3r> inside a script on the page, inside jQuery(document).ready( function() {<code>} );
[09:59:34] <clov3r> do you understand what that does and why you need it?
[09:59:53] <clov3r> the highlight is triggered by a javascript "mouseover" event
[10:00:24] <clov3r> and that jquery snippet with the squidhead demo, simply triggers the mouseover events on the highlight area, when you mouseover the link area
[10:00:27] <clov3r> make sense?
[10:00:33] <clov3r> islalobo ^
[10:04:12] <wer0ckz> Help please. Line break issue for IE only. Please see my jsfiddel: http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/tBhD4/ - Screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/7jgvh5ixp/
[10:04:32] <islalobo> clov3r I get the {<code>} part I have something like:  $('#ancon').mouseover();
[10:04:33] <islalobo> }).mouseout(function(e) {
[10:04:33] <islalobo>     $('#ancon').mouseout();
[10:04:45] <islalobo> (which I took from the documentation directly)
[10:05:06] <clov3r> oh
[10:05:22] <clov3r> probably your problem lies in the fact that you have more than one element with id "ancon"
[10:05:22] <Mottie> wer0ckz: this irc is to help with jQuery, not fix notepad... there really isn't much we can do
[10:05:38] <clov3r> <area id="ancon" ... >
[10:05:48] <clov3r> <li><a id="ancon" ...>
[10:05:55] <clov3r> islalobo ^
[10:06:24] <islalobo> But I thought that I was supposed to use the same id="" to highlight the same coordinates? I am misunderstanding something
[10:06:36] <clov3r> nope
[10:06:37] <WebDragon|laptop> http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.javascript.jquery the mailing list tracking seems to have fallen off around 2010 -- did the mailing list just go away or something ?
[10:06:46] <wer0ckz> Mottie: i was wondering if its possible to insert a '\n' or '\r\n' somewhere on my code
[10:06:55] <clov3r> call the anchor <a id="ancon-trigger">
[10:07:31] <clov3r> then $("#ancon-trigger").mouseover( function() { $('#ancon').mousover() ...
[10:11:16] <WebDragon|laptop> suden invasion of people all with tails makes me nervous
[10:15:37] <mehwork> If my only current reason for not using jQuery Mobile is that I need a 100% custom "look and feel" (e.g., my own style for layout, buttons/menus/widgets, and css in general); is that enough reason to not use jQuery Mobile or is there a way to completely customize the look and feel of it?
[10:16:05] <islalobo> clov3r okay, I get that. Now I have http://pastie.org/7903422
[10:16:32] <islalobo> But it still doesn't work. Defined within <script type="text/javascript">
[10:16:48] <clov3r> ...
[10:17:10] <clov3r> do you actually have an element with id="squidheadlink" ?
[10:17:42] <islalobo> no, no
[10:18:04] <didiergm_> mehwork I use JQM for what it provides me and I also created several custom widgets (painted on canvas) like an horizontal thermometer and a semi circular gauge
[10:18:05] <islalobo> Sorry that was posted from an old crtl+copy
[10:18:17] <didiergm_> mehwork and both work together fine
[10:18:41] <didiergm_> mehwork it depens how much 'own' look and feel you need
[10:19:09] <didiergm_> mehwork the navigation part is excellent the split in pages is also excellent several facts could be of use to you
[10:19:21] <clov3r> islalobo: try this http://pastie.org/7903430
[10:19:39] <clov3r> you had a type in "mousover" (try "mouseover")
[10:20:23] <mehwork> didiergm_: i mainly need more custom looking side-bar/panes
[10:21:14] <didiergm_> mehwork panels are left up to you to customize; JQM provides the mecanism to open/slide and cose; the inner content is yours
[10:21:28] <didiergm_> s/cose/close/
[10:22:30] <didiergm_> mehwork: jqm has also done a lot of work (like JQ at it's own level) to iron out browser diffs
[10:22:57] <didiergm_> mehwork: to *me* it lloks like a waste not to stand up on their shoulders - but to each is own I suppose
[10:23:23] <islalobo> clov3r I have this: http://pastie.org/7903448
[10:23:28] <didiergm_> s/lloks/lloks, s/each is/each his/
[10:23:42] <islalobo> I just changed <script type="tect/javascript"> to <script>
[10:23:59] <mehwork> didiergm_: well my concern is that i just don't know enough about jqm yet. I know the basics, but it's  very possible that it's possible to do what i need to with it. Sometimes i think it might take a lot of work to get it to work but the alternative is using Sencha Touch or something that's also very hard to use
[10:24:50] <clov3r> ok islalobo, now wrap the jquery code inside $(document).ready(function() { <$('#ancon-trigger')...> });
[10:24:57] <wer0ckz> Help please. Line break issue for IE only. Please see my jsfiddel: http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/tBhD4/ - Screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/7jgvh5ixp/ - is it possible to insert something like '\n' or '\r\n'?
[10:26:10] <didiergm_> mehwork: I hear what you say - I had the same question in my mind not so long ago. implementing panels is not that hard, have a quick play with it I think it will be time well invested. JQM is a completely thought out environment I found Sencha to be complex and lacking. but then again this is *my* opinion; not trying to foce-feed you
[10:27:29] <islalobo> clov3r like this? http://pastie.org/7903465
[10:28:33] <didiergm_> mehwork: they also have so clever tricks up their sleeves : a nice set of adaptative layout based on device size, which is a real pain to implement manually. the downside is that with the upcoming 1.4 release you'll have to be more & more clever and well versed in CSS - they are replacing a lot of js with CSS - for the better (smaller and leaner code) but will require a much higher knowledge of CSS to actually alter
[10:29:05] <didiergm_> mehwork: but that' isnot JQM specific; I think that's the way most tools are going
[10:29:15] <mehwork> didiergm_: i see
[10:29:44] <mehwork> didiergm_: so the bottom line is that JQM isn't just limited to 'basic' phone apps, it's really able to do everything sencha touch can do, just in a different way?
[10:30:20] <clov3r> islalobo, sorry i'm clearly not being very good with my psuedo-syntax
[10:30:24] <clov3r> like this: http://pastie.org/7903475
[10:32:29] <didiergm_> mehwork: the first app I wrote and delivered with JQM is a B-to-B app where technicians in a plant a taking measures offline on running systems. Back in the office they reconnect the tablet, upload the data to a server which generates maintenance reports . not your basic  phone app I should think :)
[10:39:11] <neuroserpens> so... I'm trying to send a formdata containing an image through $.ajax, I set processData to false so it doesn't throw that "illegal invocation", but now i'm getting a http://localhost:9898/uploadpics?[object%20Object] and i want the request to be /uploadpics?fd=[object%20Object]
[10:39:38] <neuroserpens> i need key value... not just value
[10:40:42] <webstormer> you should probably not set processData to false then
[10:42:13] <webstormer> http://pastebin.com/N7wgbN64 -- does anyone know why in keyup event under the first if the extractSSNDigits function is defined, but in the else if block it's undefined? it's the strangest error
[10:43:55] <webstormer> http://pastebin.com/N7wgbN64 -- does anyone know why in keyup event under the first if the extractSSNDigits function is defined, but in the else if block it's undefined? it's the strangest error
[10:46:07] <islalobo> clov3r I think yours is much much better than my own. I put in your suggestion but it still isn't working — do you think it might be the plugin missing something? ——> http://pastie.org/7903539
[10:46:35] <clov3r> do you have a live example?
[10:46:45] <clov3r> is the plugin working correctly otherwise?
[10:47:50] <mehwork> didiergm_: cool, well i meant 'basic' more in the sense of "look". Like everything seems to be big buttons and menus as far as UI in JQM, but maybe i've only seen the out-of-the-box demos
[10:51:14] <islalobo> clov3r we are using it on a drupal site http://develgobernabilidad.idl.org.pe/content/riesgos-y-recursos-preventivos-del-delito-lima-metropolitana-y-el-callao
[10:51:34] <neuroserpens> so... I'm trying to send a formdata containing an image through $.ajax, I set processData to false so it doesn't throw that "illegal invocation", but now i'm getting a http://localhost:9898/uploadpics?[object%20Object] and i need the request to be /uploadpics?fd=[object%20Object]
[10:51:51] <islalobo> The highligh works on the image (the coordinates are off, but I am waiting to fix them until I get everything working and have the map in a better resolution)
[10:52:04] <islalobo> the list item doesn't do anything :(
[10:52:38] <webstormer> nevermind to my question above
[10:52:55] <NoiseEee> neuroserpens: you don't need that request, "fd" is bunk unless you turn it into something the backend can use
[10:56:48] <clov3r> islalobo: my bad, jquery has not been assigned to $
[10:56:50] <clov3r> try http://pastie.org/7903571
[10:57:51] <islalobo> clov3r!
[10:58:04] <islalobo> You were so helpful!
[10:58:09] <clov3r> is works?
[10:58:10] <clov3r> ;)
[10:58:14] <islalobo> That enabled it to work!
[10:58:16] <clov3r> glad to hear it :)
[10:58:20] <islalobo> clov3r++
[10:58:43] <islalobo> clov3r++
[10:59:05] <islalobo> Twice because it was really great of you to help me, even though my javascript knowledge isn't the best!
[11:00:12] <Qtax_> making a plugin, what's a good way/"api" to set a plugins configuration?
[11:00:49] <Gho5t> following the docs
[11:02:04] <Qtax_> i mean default options
[11:02:25] <Gho5t> you set them in the options array
[11:02:26] <Qtax_> not set for a specific element
[11:02:29] <Gho5t> like the docs say
[11:02:39] <neuroserpens> nice... i don't get even an "i don't know"
[11:02:44] <Qtax_> that array is used per selector tho?
[11:03:01] <NoiseEee> neuroserpens: you don't need that request, "fd" is bunk unless you turn it into something the backend can use
[11:03:46] <Gho5t> Qtax_: yes, per instance
[11:04:07] <Qtax_> so how would you nicely set the defaults?
[11:04:27] <Gho5t> I don't get what you're asking
[11:04:39] <neuroserpens> NoiseEee: the backend requires key value... if i leave it that way I only get a string called object that has a value of nothing
[11:04:47] <Gho5t> you set  the defaults and every instance gets the same defaults
[11:04:52] <Gho5t> that's what...defaults are for
[11:05:48] <NoiseEee> neuroserpens: then you need to supply a key/value pair, not the string "[Object object]"
[11:05:55] <NoiseEee> neuroserpens: so start there
[11:06:20] <Qtax_> the default settings which are used by the plugin. the example in the docs don't change the defaults used. it only passes the options used for the current elements selected.
[11:06:34] <Gho5t> it merges them
[11:06:57] <Qtax_> without changing the defaults.
[11:07:02] <Gho5t> man
[11:07:06] <Gho5t> I'm out
[11:08:48] <Qtax_> by using $.fn.name.defaults, oki
[11:10:01] <neuroserpens> NoiseEee: i AM doing that... in the ajax data field I have {fd: formd}... and formd is the formdata object
[11:12:46] <neuroserpens> NoiseEee: I'm not passing a string... The server ends up understanding it as a string because I had to set processData to false...
[11:12:56] <neuroserpens> NoiseEee: As if it is a key to no value
[11:15:27] <NoiseEee> neuroserpens: i guess i'm unclear as to what your issue is
[11:15:57] <neuroserpens> NoiseEee: I need to find a way to make the request contain a key to that value
[11:16:12] <neuroserpens> NoiseEee: That behaviour is normally handled by processData
[11:16:24] <neuroserpens> NoiseEee: But I had to set it to false so I can send a formdata object
[11:16:34] <shoky_> neuroserpens: i think you need  to send just formd
[11:16:48] <neuroserpens> crap man I explained why that doesn't work
[11:17:07] <shoky_> you just said you're sending {fd: formd}
[11:17:11] <shoky_> not formd
[11:17:21] <neuroserpens> oh you mean that
[11:17:46] <neuroserpens> shoky_: just tried it... same thing
[11:18:20] <shoky_> and it needs to be a POST
[11:18:26] <shoky_> not a get
[11:19:35] <brombomb-w> Does anyone have a work around for calling a method on a widget before initialization?  Just upgraded to 1.9 and it's a major breaking change.
[11:20:18] <dcherman2> brombomb-w: how does that make sense?  you're calling a method on something that essentially doesn't exist
[11:20:47] <brombomb-w> becuase in the past it was doing a no-op which was perfect in my scenario
[11:21:10] <brombomb-w> it allowed me to shortcut a lot of logic and just liberally apply method calls
[11:21:20] <brombomb-w> multiple video player instances per page
[11:21:55] <dcherman2> brombomb-w: so then just duck punch whatever logic you want into $.fn.yourwidget.  if no widget exists on an element, make it a no-op
[11:21:56] <neuroserpens> shoky_: it was a post... only difference is that I wasn't seeing the cause of the error
[11:22:18] <neuroserpens> I changed to get to see how it was sending this crappy request
[11:22:57] <brombomb-w> I don't know what you mean by "into" dcherman2 ?  There's no methods available in the Widget factory to extend
[11:27:11] <dcherman2> brombomb-w: you'll probably need to tinker with this a bit, but here's a base to start from: http://jsfiddle.net/B3xpE/
[11:32:35] <saml> hey, can I do <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.0.min.js"  >   ?  or that's not cdn?
[11:37:07] <noaXess> can anybody help in a workaround for this issue? https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/145
[11:40:26] <wad3> Hola
[11:50:59] <atula> haven't done a lot of front-end lately since I'm deep in python land
[11:51:08] <atula> what do you guys think about angularjs?
[11:51:27] <atula> I've sent one of my guys to deal with some front-end stuff wit angularjs and he's doing: https://ncryptedcloud.atlassian.net/browse/WEBAUD-3
[11:51:30] <atula> sorry
[11:51:31] <atula> worry link
[11:51:40] <atula> this: http://pastie.org/private/ln7gr9btkxoalkc3zas8q
[11:51:43] <atula> that's the source
[11:51:58] <atula> that's like sprinkling javascript in the dom
[11:52:06] <atula> it's confusing to me heh
[11:52:08] <atula> any thoughts?
[11:52:08] <ali4ever4> hey anyone have thought of making a server side jquery !!! may be with nodeJS , just an idea came to my mind but don't know if someone have actually worked on it
[11:53:22] <reed1> ali4ever4: That's a cool idea, but there's no DOM on the server. What would such a jQuery do without a DOM to search?
[11:55:15] <ali4ever4> reed1, well asp.NET treat DOM elements as serverside controls depending on viewstate data, something similler could be created where the server side controls will be controlled by server side jquery and it will make better integration between server side and client side elements of the website
[11:57:16] <reed1> ali4ever4: Cool, thanks for elaborating. I don't know much about asp.NET, but that sounds neat :)
[11:59:19] <Guddu> Could someone help taking a look at http://dpaste.com/1152630/ for any obvious performance issues in my code? This code works fine on Chrome but on IE it takes 10 times more time (upto 2 minutes or so) in executing :-(
[12:00:28] <ali4ever4> reed1, thanks
[12:06:07] <paulvd> there is a very ugly hover coming here http://cardinalwebsolutions.net/bestinboating/boat-types/deck-boats/ can anyone figure it out which file it is in and which function
[12:06:22] <paulvd> hover over the images
[12:07:50] <aflag> hello. I want to make a modal contact form. What do you advise me to use?
[12:10:14] <Zzaichik> I like colorbox.js
[12:14:44] <reed> Guddu: My internet skipped, if you replied to me in the last 5 min.
[12:15:14] <Guddu> reed sorry. I did not get any message from you either.
[12:15:24] <Guddu> Looks like you got disconnected
[12:15:40] <Guddu> I hope to hear your suggestions
[12:15:42] <reed> Guddu: Last thing I said: It doesn't look like you're doing anything terribly uncouth, except lots of .each. Which IE are you testing on? IE8 and below are just… slower at some stuff
[12:15:44] <reed1> Guddu: It doesn't look like you're doing anything terribly uncouth, except lots of .each. Which IE are you testing on? IE8 and below are just… slower at some stuff
[12:16:03] <Guddu> reed IE7 was part of this test
[12:16:12] <Guddu> IE8 is much much better
[12:16:30] <Guddu> Firefox even better
[12:16:33] <Guddu> Chrome best
[12:16:44] <Guddu> Have not tested on Opera or Safari yet
[12:16:58] <verymickey> hey guys. quick question.. jquery is loaded ( i see it in firebug as loaded) but i am getting $ is not defined errors.. any idea where to look or what might be killing it?
[12:17:17] <BillCriswell> verymickey: You're trying to use it before it's loaded probably.
[12:17:58] <verymickey> BillCriswell i am getting the error on the $(document).ready(fucntion)… bit is there something i need to do before that?
[12:18:12] <BillCriswell> verymickey: Just make sure jQuery is loaded.
[12:18:20] <BillCriswell> Before you call that.
[12:18:31] <verymickey> ok. thanks
[12:19:07] <BillCriswell> You can't do <script> $(document).read(function(){ /* Doin stuffs */ });  </script> <script src="jquery.js"></script>, must be the other way.
[12:20:09] <verymickey> BillCriswell ok ill move the include to the top of my template and see if that helps (probably will)
[12:20:22] <verymickey> but i thought best practice was to put the includes at the bottom on the page.
[12:20:38] <sunbeam> Anye notepad++ users in here?
[12:20:49] <spokenn> Hello, I want a text input to slide and display text input #2 after a user enters a value and presses "go"
[12:20:49] <BillCriswell> verymickey: It is.
[12:21:00] <spokenn> Can anyone help me accomplish this with a simple addition form
[12:21:06] <spokenn> I use notepad++
[12:21:15] <neuroserpens> windows... eww
[12:21:22] <verymickey> BillCriswell ok i getcha.. guess i just need to remove the in page jquery
[12:21:53] <BillCriswell> verymickey: <script src="jquery.js"></script> <script> $('.foo').addClass('bar'); </script> </body>
[12:21:53] <verymickey> yup yup I'm with you now.
[12:22:01] <BillCriswell> verymickey: If you're keeping jQuery in your footer you don't need to do $(document).ready
[12:23:27] <sunbeam> spokenn: how can i use arabic RTL ?
[12:23:31] <verymickey> BillCriswell i think the problem is that I am loading jquery in footer.. but my view pages have document.ready stuff in them (which is getting combined with my templates.. but appearing higher in the page.
[12:26:30] <verymickey> BillCriswell everything working again now that its properly ordered, thanks for pointing out the obvious to me :)
[12:27:44] <BillCriswell> verymickey: No problem!
[12:27:56] <BillCriswell> Just check the error logs and it should hopefully get you going quick!

[12:29:33] <hcker2000> if I have a jquery mobile question should I ask in here or in jquerymobile-dev?
[12:32:19] <funhouse> Hi there, just wondering if anyone can recommend a good text shadow plugin?
[12:35:34] <cardguy1000> I'm having an issue retrievingg data from a $.each.  I have a php page which returns an object that contains success,message,payload.  Payload is an array of objects.  I'm having problems accessing the object values.  http://pastebin.com/wf9y8M3z in this paste the alert returns undefined.  However, as you can see in the comment below the code the console.log of value does have escrowID
[12:38:32] <hcker2000> in jquery mobile
[12:38:50] <hcker2000> I'm trying to hookinto a button that opens a pannel
[12:39:36] <cardguy1000> I'm guessing it is interpreting value as a string instead of an object?
[12:40:22] <hcker2000> im targeting the panel just by setting a href="mypanelid"
[12:40:24] <hcker2000> and that works
[12:40:40] <hcker2000> but I need to do some ajax and what not to determin if the panel should indeed open or not
[12:42:11] <hcker2000> cardguy1000, im assuming whats coming back from your ajax is json?
[12:42:36] <cardguy1000> hcker2000: yeah, looks like I had to to $.parseJSON
[12:42:59] <cardguy1000> Didn't realize that was necessary if it was valid json
[12:43:28] <hcker2000> cardguy1000, in the newer versions of jquery it should not be necicary to do that
[12:44:01] <NoiseEee> are you providing the correct headers on the JSON response?
[12:44:09] <cardguy1000> hcker2000: I'm using 1.9.1
[12:44:48] <hcker2000> cardguy1000, odd maybe it is the headers though I never have had to send any thing special back
[12:44:58] <hcker2000> normally i will just echo out the json string
[12:45:23] <shoky_> it looks like a json string embedded in another json string. jquery is parsing the ajax data fine
[12:46:40] <cardguy1000> raw dump of json http://pastebin.com/gFh13Spn
[12:46:46] <cardguy1000> jsonlint says it's valid
[12:46:53] <shoky_> yes see,
[12:46:58] <shoky_> payload is an array of json strings
[12:47:40] <cardguy1000> ah
[12:47:43] <cardguy1000> indeed it is!
[12:47:44] <hcker2000> yup that will cause the problem right there
[12:47:49] <cardguy1000> thank shoky_
[12:47:51] <shoky_> if you want it to not be json strings you'd need:   {"payload": [{"escrowID":"101", ...
[12:49:16] <cardguy1000> object in php has a getJSON which is string, so yeah need to probably return that as an array so json_encode works right.  make sense.  Thanks.
[12:54:25] <hcker2000> So any one got any thoughts on how to hook into my link that opens a panel and prevent it from opening said panel under some conditions?
[12:59:45] <titustheox> Ciao belli
[13:00:53] <titustheox> hi to all
[13:01:03] <shoky_> hcker2000: handle the click event on the link and preventDefault() on the event argument to preven tit
[13:01:07] <shoky_> prevent it*
[13:01:53] <titustheox> dear all, i'd like to write javascript code to make ircbot, please can you tell me where i can find a guide
[13:01:54] <titustheox> ?
[13:02:38] <hcker2000> shoky_, one would think that would work but it does not
[13:02:48] <hcker2000> shoky_, let me put together an example
[13:04:43] <shoky_> hcker2000: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/6bDem/
[13:10:18] <funhouse> Does anyone know of any good text shadow plugins that actually work? Google doesnt.
[13:10:43] <hcker2000> shoky_, thats not really using jquery mobiles panels
[13:10:45] <goddard> how can i access objects or array in my variable that looks like this Object {businessData: Object, businessLocation: Array[2], businessAttachment: Array[1]}
[13:11:12] <goddard> i tried data.businessLocation and console.log that and it is undefined, but when i just console.log(data) it outputs what i just pasted
[13:12:01] <hcker2000> shoky_, every time I added the panel markup the fsfiddle tanks
[13:13:11] <funhouse> goddard: goddard are you sure there is data in Array[2] ?
[13:13:14] <hcker2000> shoky_, I'm specifically talking about these http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.0/docs/widgets/panels/
[13:13:34] <goddard> funhouse, that is a print out of data
[13:13:35] <funhouse> goddard: because it should work.
[13:13:47] <goddard> funhouse, thats what i thought
[13:14:11] <funhouse> goddard: that's what it's out putting?
[13:15:00] <funhouse> goddard: if you are using console.log(data) it should be showing the data inside rather thatn 'Array[2]'
[13:15:01] <goddard> funhouse, Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'businessLocation' of undefined
[13:15:21] <funhouse> goddard: probably issue with your data.
[13:15:31] <goddard> 					console.log(data);
[13:15:31] <goddard> 					console.log(data.businessLocation);
[13:16:19] <funhouse> goddard: what is it supposed to output?
[13:16:33] <goddard> funhouse,?
[13:17:13] <funhouse> goddard: what is 'businessLocation' supposed to be?
[13:17:26] <funhouse> goddard: are you sure it's even set?
[13:17:54] <goddard> funhouse, nevermind i figured it out
[13:17:59] <goddard> funhouse, it was a caching issue
[13:18:28] <uGoMobi> hcker2000: you can open the panel dynamically
[13:18:31] <funhouse> good now I just need to find a text shadow plugin that works.
[13:20:00] <hcker2000> uGoMobi, got an example?
[13:21:07] <uGoMobi> hcker2000: $( "#panelid" ).panel( "open" );
[13:21:13] <uGoMobi> hcker2000: http://api.jquerymobile.com/panel/#method-open
[13:21:40] <hcker2000> uGoMobi, got it I missed the api link at the top thanks
[13:21:44] <uGoMobi> just use <a href="#" id="myid">Link to open panel</a>
[13:22:14] <uGoMobi> hcker2000: yw
[13:22:50] <rdg> what would cause a .change() to only fire on page load and never when someone is selecting a value from a drop down
[13:25:10] <paul> Hey guys, hopefully this is a good place to ask this (if not, please kindly direct me to a better place to ask) : I'm currently working on my first website (besides a couple simple proof of concepts), and it's for a couple photographers, who want to share a 'home page' where you click on either one of their pictures to go to their respective main sites. This isn't the part i have problems with, rather, its that they both have particular req
[13:25:10] <paul> uests, and these are things i THINK i should be using jQuery for (or php.. honestly don't know): Both of them want some kind of protection for their uploaded photos, emails set up for the two of them (which i guess is probably done through the webhost?), and one of them wants a 'temporary secure area' where a customer has ~6 months access to an online gallery of photos that no one else has access to. Any suggestions for how i should go abou
[13:25:10] <paul> t these? and if jQuery is the right tool for any/all of these?
[13:26:46] <adamsilver> how can I get the p which has text starting by "Powered by"?
[13:26:48] <rdg> example of my change not firing except on load - http://pastebin.com/sph37Ecs
[13:27:21] <NoiseEee> paul: stuff on the backend, PHP or other language; front-end UI etc, jquery.
[13:29:07] <paul> NoiseEee: Okay. Still learning what all that is about. So would you say PHP for private gallery access, jQuery for the photo protection, webhost for the emails??
[13:30:32] <rdg> typo in that link i had - http://pastebin.com/v5i8zwC8
[13:32:02] <NoiseEee> paul: php for everything you've mentioned really
[13:37:12] <adamsilver> is this syntax correct: $("p:contains('Powered by')").hide() ?
[13:39:35] <clov3r> adamsilver: yes
[13:40:41] <clov3r> $("p:contains('Powered by')").hide()
[13:40:55] <clov3r> http://jsfiddle.net/mF23b/ ^^
[13:43:40] <adamsilver> clov3r: thanks but why it's not hiding this: http://pastebin.com/W8Rfdc9K
[13:44:17] <clov3r> adamsilver: not sure try the jsfiddle ^
[13:45:05] <shoky_> hcker2000: seems jqmobile panels has a bug with jquery 2 or smth
[13:45:08] <rdg> will jsfiddle not give you the error of why it's failing to run
[13:45:11] <shoky_> hcker2000: anyways,  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/6bDem/4/
[13:45:56] <clov3r> rdg: console.log?
[13:46:00] <eddiemonge> adamsilver: is that paraggraph added to the page dynamically?
[13:46:53] <rdg> thank you
[13:47:14] <eddiemonge> adamsilver: http://jsfiddle.net/mF23b/2/
[13:47:35] <shoky_> hcker2000: or maybe you want .open() instad of .toggle()
[13:47:48] <rdg> http://jsfiddle.net/nVMVk/   thoughts on why that won't alert when i make selections?
[13:49:27] <shoky_> rdg: $('.boc-questions').change(updateCodes());   is wrong
[13:49:48] <rdg> ..... what's wrong about it?
[13:49:57] <shoky_> rdg: i suppose you want .change(updateCodes)  but the argument to updateCodes will be the event object
[13:50:20] <rdg> that's fine, i just want it to get into the method first.. that'd be a victory
[13:50:23] <rdg> it's only running on page load
[13:50:23] <shoky_> rdg: updateCodes()  executes updateCodes right away
[13:50:55] <shoky_> and puts the return value as the change handler.. not what you'd want
[13:51:23] <rdg> that's fine, i'll figure that out once it starts firing as expected and i can firebug it
[13:51:30] <rdg> but what about it keeps it from firing when selecting something
[13:51:46] <shoky_> rdg: also.. you have the wrong class name there
[13:52:50] <rdg> egadz
[13:54:31] <shoky_> hcker2000: oh nvm, i see you got a better answer
[13:56:58] <rdg> http://jsfiddle.net/nVMVk/3/  ok rewritten a bit but still only fires on page load
[14:01:54] <shoky_> rdg: you're still doing updateCodes()
[14:02:22] <shoky_> $('.boc-questions').change(updateCodes());   is the same thing as:
[14:02:39] <shoky_> var x = updateCodes();  $('.boc-questions').change( x );
[14:02:52] <tw2113> totes the shokes aka shoky_
[14:02:56] <rdg> sorry, i missed that in your comment
[14:03:13] <rdg> is that so jquery can pass its own arguments?
[14:03:17] <rdg> by calling  x(event)
[14:03:26] <shoky_> no..
[14:03:42] <shoky_> updateCodes()  means execute updateCodes now, and return some value from it
[14:03:44] <rdg> btw - that fixed it, I appreciate it. but I don't understand why that was the issue
[14:03:50] <rdg> oooh
[14:03:56] <rdg> shit. yea. that makes sense. i'm dumb.;
[14:04:02] <rdg> thank you for the help
[14:04:07] <shoky_> np
[14:05:11] <rdg> so how do I know which is triggering this event?
[14:05:34] <shoky> using this or $(this)
[14:05:35] <rdg> i see event.currenttarge .. can I just  $(event.currenttarget).val() that
[14:05:38] <rdg> ah ok
[14:06:00] <shoky> this === event.currentTarget  usually
[14:06:05] <maxmoore14> was $.mobile.initializePage() removed from jquery mobile?
[14:06:05] <shoky> in an event handler anyway
[14:06:56] <maxmoore14> if I set $.mobile.autoInitializePage = false; in the mobileinit event, how do I then trigger the page initialization?
[14:13:11] <shoky> maxmoore14: seems fine to me  http://jsbin.com/ifakiw/2/edit
[14:15:00] <wer0ckz> Help please - http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/Z29du/1/ - UI Dialog - i added dialogClass: 'dialog1' for a specific dialog and its affecting all dialogs. All dialog should have .ui-dialog-titlebar-close {visibility: hidden;}
[14:17:06] <shoky> wer0ckz: like i told you yesterday, if you don't .dialog('destroy') the old dialog instance, then it will keep the settings from the old one when you call .dialog({...}) again
[14:17:46] <wer0ckz> i see. i'll try again. thank you
[14:18:31] <wer0ckz> shoky: which part should i insert .dialog('destroy') ?
[14:19:07] <rdg> shoky: ===  being not same type but same object
[14:19:07] <wer0ckz> got it
[14:19:08] <wer0ckz>                     $(this).dialog('close').dialog('destroy');
[14:21:26] <Es0teric> i have a question -- instead of chaining methods.. isnt it possible for me to just pass the value of the result from the callback into a new instance?
[14:21:45] <maxmoore14> shoky: thanks
[14:23:02] <shoky> wer0ckz:  i would do it more like this..  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Z29du/2/
[14:23:22] <eddiemonge> Es0teric: ?
[14:23:26] <wer0ckz> thank you it's all working shocky
[14:23:43] <wer0ckz> i thoight dialog('close') should do the strick. i realized i need to destroy it too
[14:23:55] <Es0teric> eddiemonge basically what i am saying is that i want to avoid massive chaining of methods -- what is the best way to approach that?
[14:24:02] <shoky> rdg: === being same type and same value
[14:24:43] <shoky> wer0ckz:  you only need destroy if you're using the same element. there's no need to use the same element, or set the content in javascript

[14:29:41] <phillipadsmith> Anyone have a few moments to take a look at this snippet and let me know why the timeout isn't having any impact? https://gist.github.com/phillipadsmith/35fbfd70a206f1690d3c
[14:30:53] <shoky> phillipadsmith: what impact are you expecting?
[14:31:13] <phillipadsmith> shoky: I'd like the next call of poll() to happen after the timeout
[14:31:24] <phillipadsmith> Right now, it's firing on 'complete'
[14:31:33] <shoky> phillipadsmith: that's not what the timeout option of $.ajax is for..
[14:31:34] <phillipadsmith> so it's a bit excessively polling
[14:31:42] <eddiemonge> phillipadsmith: your timeout is 300 seconds?
[14:31:50] <phillipadsmith> shoky: I didn't think so either, but it was being used in an example
[14:31:53] <Z3R0> I think you want something like setTimeout() ?
[14:31:55] <shoky> phillipadsmith:  setTimeout
[14:32:08] <Z3R0> and create an infinite loop to Poll() every X seconds
[14:32:22] <Z3R0> or setInterval()
[14:32:33] <eddiemonge> or not setInterval
[14:32:34] <phillipadsmith> eddiemonge: naw, I was just making 100% sure it wasn't working ;)
[14:32:44] <Z3R0> o.o
[14:32:54] <phillipadsmith> So, I'm trying to follow the "long polling" pattern
[14:33:27] <shoky> complete: function() { setTimeout(poll, 10000); }
[14:33:42] <phillipadsmith> shoky: ah, okay, that's what I was after I think...
[14:33:45] * phillipadsmith goes to try that
[14:33:59] <Z3R0> ah that makes more sense lol
[14:35:08] <phillipadsmith> shoky: bingo! Many thanks to you sir.

[14:39:35] <phillipadsmith> eddiemonge: yes, looked at that.
[14:40:53] <eddiemonge> phillipadsmith: two things: passing in the html stuff as an object can be cleaner and you dont need to do pass in the $() part to an append

[14:52:07] <boytoy> eddiemonge: trying to migrate from https://github.com/viljamis/ResponsiveSlides.js which has fade as default, but it's not as nice and clean as swipejs and it's not mobile so
[14:55:22] <eddiemonge> with a name like ResponsiveSlides its not mobile-friendly?
[14:55:43] <shoky> maxmoore14:  i donno bout all that phonegap stuff but.. .then(setTimeout(function () { app.phoneGapInit(); }, 100));   is wrong
[14:56:06] <shoky> maxmoore14:  should be .then(function() { setTimeout(...) })
[14:56:24] <maxmoore14> shoky: ah, ok
[14:56:30] <maxmoore14> I'll try that now
[14:58:05] <boytoy> eddiemonge: i reckon touch-friendly was what i was gonna say
[14:59:28] <KWhat_Work1> If I need to select an element dynamically added, do I need to do something special first?
[14:59:50] <eddiemonge> KWhat_Work1: no
[15:00:22] <funhouse> eddiemonge: thank you but doesnt work in IE9
[15:00:59] <eddiemonge> funhouse: a lot of things dont work in ie9, or ie8, or ie7, or ie10
[15:01:02] <funhouse> eddiemonge: thats why I was looking for a plugin.
[15:01:52] <funhouse> Well would be nice if users stopped using that browser but 15-30% of users still using that garbage.
[15:02:33] <eddiemonge> http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/
[15:04:11] <tw2113> does css text shadow not suffice? ignoring IE8 and down
[15:04:18] <tw2113> doesn't IE9 support it natively?
[15:04:19] <eddiemonge> http://www.impressivewebs.com/css3-text-shadow-ie/
[15:04:33] <eddiemonge> http://www.impressivewebs.com/css3-text-shadow-ie/
[15:04:46] <eddiemonge> sorry, meant http://caniuse.com/#search=text-shadow tw2113
[15:05:03] <tw2113> it's me being an ass, but if your ux completely fails without some text shadow, that's bad design
[15:05:21] <boytoy> tw2113: lulz
[15:05:32] <tw2113> dang, even IE9 doesn't support it
[15:05:42] <tw2113> i hadn't looked lately
[15:11:52] <funhouse> thank you eddiemonge checking
[15:30:47] <TheWarden> Hi, I have the following code that toggles highlighting (selects) of a table row, https://gist.github.com/thewarden/cdcbaee26cc244fe3049. It works fine, however when I dynamically add a new table row to the table that new row is not  selectable. I can't even seem to have it invoke the .click event.
[15:30:52] <TheWarden> what could I be doing wrong?
[15:31:41] <TheWarden> the only difference from the table rows that were there to start with and the ones that are added dynamically is that those new table rows are added dynamically. If they exist before hand there is no issue.
[15:38:29] <TheWarden> there, I've add a sample of the table without the thead and tfoot.
[15:38:31] <TheWarden> https://gist.github.com/thewarden/cdcbaee26cc244fe3049
[15:59:20] <TonkaTruck> Anyone know of a tiny js serializer that does this https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/serialize.js ?  I need something without jquery dependency.
[15:59:27] <TonkaTruck> Thought this would be a GREAT place to ask.
[16:00:03] <min|dvir|us> TonkaTruck: why do you need something with a jQuery dependency?
[16:00:35] <TonkaTruck> I'm going to assume you meant without.  It's for a third-party widget and this is on the server side of an easyxdm implementation.
[16:00:48] <TonkaTruck> "provider" side.  Trying to keep things light is all.
[16:02:51] <TonkaTruck> oh I found one.
[16:19:08] <JohnnyCache> Question:
[16:19:21] <JohnnyCache> Is there any way to "apply" a given querystring on a form?
[16:19:57] <JohnnyCache> like i have a form with firstname (text), lastname (text) & accept agreement (checkbox)
[16:20:18] <JohnnyCache> and i have querystring like "firstname=a&lastname=b&agree=1"
[16:20:41] <JohnnyCache> and i want to load the page and then "autofill" the form with those details
[16:20:52] <sacho> There's no built-in function.
[16:20:58] <JohnnyCache> any plugin?
[16:21:13] <anew_> what is it called when you hover ur mouse over an image and it shows u the full size image in a popup
[16:22:17] <anew_> please jesus
[16:22:44] <min|dvir|us> anew_: he's dead, dude.
[16:22:50] <anew_> noooooooooooo
[16:55:42] <frb> This is likely a very simple question, but not one I can figure out: http://jsfiddle.net/sN63r/1/ Why does clicking the first link cause the function to happen, but not the second?
[16:55:58] <frb> I cannot change the markup of the page, unfortunately, but need to bind a function to _both_ elements.
[16:59:10] <min|dvir|us> frb: that's not how you use IDs.
[16:59:22] <min|dvir|us> The markup must be changed, or use a different selector.
[17:00:05] <frb> It should be a class
[17:00:12] <frb> Unfortunately this is how the markup is already
[17:00:15] <frb> It's a user script
[17:00:34] <min|dvir|us> Then use a different selector.
[17:01:01] <min|dvir|us> frb: hint: $('[id="x"]');
[17:01:18] <frb> thanks min|dvir|us :)
[17:02:29] <thekracker> hello, can someone help me find out what is wrong with my js list sorting? i'm trying to sort an array of distances numerically but it seems to be doing it wrong, putting 11.8 after 1.5 but before 3.1
[17:03:27] <thekracker> my code for the sort is here: http://pastebin.com/LmS77eDy
[17:16:57] <shoky> thekracker: seems fine to me  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/m7LzE/3/
[17:17:21] <shoky> thekracker: except that you're sorting floats and non-floats in opposite order
[17:19:37] <shoky> but i guess you wanted that, nvm
[17:29:48] <relipse> is there a way to gray out a checkbox (but it is still enabled and working normally?)
[17:35:20] <jtbandes> it seems that if I specify "done" or "complete" function for a .animate() call, then the .promise() will never finish... is this expected? how should I get around it?
[17:38:11] <shoky> jtbandes: that's not expected.. can you post a jsfiddle or some demo?
[17:41:53] <min|dvir|us> jtbandes: use promises.
[17:41:53] <min|dvir|us> .animate().done().promise();
[17:42:46] <jtbandes> shoky: ahh... I discovered the problem
[17:42:52] <jtbandes> my "done" function has $(this).remove()
[17:43:01] <jtbandes> which apparently cancels the promise
[17:48:40] <innociv__> http://jsbin.com/ofapew/1/edit I'm trying to use jsPlumb to connect two points.  Those green dots, to the top of a black border box.  You can see it is making a green dot end point to where the line should go, but the line doesn't go there.
[18:04:50] <shoky> innociv__:  http://jsbin.com/ofapew/6/edit
[18:05:06] <innociv__> Ohhhhh
[18:05:09] <innociv__> You're amazing.
[18:05:29] <shoky> all i did was read through http://jsplumbtoolkit.com/doc/setup
[18:06:12] <innociv__> I read some examples and such and missed that.
[18:06:51] <abjorn> this fucking day guys
[18:06:53] <abjorn> i had a day
[18:06:55] <abjorn> let me tell you
[18:08:35] <innociv__> Tell us.
[18:08:37] <innociv__> We're listening
[18:09:26] <abjorn> Oh...I...wasn't actually going to.
[18:09:50] <abjorn> Mainly because a total 0 of it has to do with jQuery (I know, that hasn't stopped me before, but it's a long story).
[18:09:53] <innociv__> You said to let me tell you
[18:09:59] <abjorn> Well
[18:10:00] <abjorn> I lied
[18:10:07] <innociv__> I'll never trust you again.
[18:10:14] <abjorn> you probably shouldn't
[18:10:33] <abjorn> Rule 1: The abjorn lies
[18:13:34] <mike_f> Might anyone know if there is an event I need to bind to other than hashchange which will be triggered in IE when I push F5 with a #! in my URL?
[18:13:54] <mike_f> In chrome, if I reload a #! page, I get the hashchange event.
[18:14:48] <abjorn> you should get hashchange even in IE >= 8
[18:14:59] <abjorn> there's shims out there for older browsers
[18:21:47] <coldhead> rough day, abjorn
[18:22:07] <abjorn> yes, though I suppose with some upsides
[18:22:16] <coldhead> like bacon?
[18:22:18] <coldhead> and butterflies?
[18:22:28] <abjorn> well, no, not quite
[18:32:44] <anew_> anyone doing any kind of webcam recording and upload with jquery
[18:32:45] <anew_> ?
[18:33:11] <lenswipee> anew_: are you making a porno site?
[18:33:23] <anew_> lol
[18:33:24] <anew_> no
[18:33:34] <lenswipee> anew_: ok
[18:33:39] * lenswipee afk
[18:33:46] <coldhead> hahaha
[18:34:04] <anew_> lol
[18:34:09] <abjorn> lol
[18:34:42] <anew_> is an iphone camera considered a webcam or is that different also
[18:35:53] * lenswipee is back
[18:36:11] <lenswipee> anew_: I think iphone is considered a smart phone.
[18:36:54] <anew_> lol
[18:37:26] <lenswipee> anew_: You got girls lined up with smart phones?
[18:37:46] <anew_> i swear it's not for porn
[18:37:57] <lenswipee> anew_: OK
[18:38:21] <anew_> any reasonable answers in the room tho?  anyone ever do any camera work with jq ? or is this a job for something else
[18:39:14] <cardguy1000> say you want to further limit the this object in a $.each(function{….}); how would one go about doing this?  For example say you iterate the rows so that a tr element is your this.  Now you want to apply some action to the td:last. Something pseudo like $('this td:last').somefunction();
[18:39:24] <coldhead> anew_: i guess you want to use webRTC
[18:39:33] <coldhead> but i don't know if that has recording capabilities
[18:39:56] <anew_> thx coldhead will get started looking at ths
[18:39:58] <lenswipee> coldhead: hi brotha
[18:40:23] <coldhead> hey girl
[18:41:07] <mAx--> .c
[18:43:25] <cardguy1000> is find() the correct function maybe?
[18:44:46] <coldhead> cardguy1000: you would generally do your filtering before the each(), so the function is then as simple as possible
[18:44:56] <coldhead> $('tr').filter(':last').each(...)
[18:45:07] <coldhead> that's a terrible example, $('tr:last') would be neater
[18:45:15] <coldhead> you may also want to use ?map
[18:45:26] <coldhead> `api map
[18:45:26] <b-ot> coldhead: .map(): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[18:45:31] <coldhead> thanks for nothing, bot-t
[18:47:36] <cardguy1000> thanks I will check out map.  Trying to make the function reusable so initial filter might not work out that well.
[18:48:17] <coldhead> you could just do if (! $(this).is(':last-child')) return; maybe
[18:48:26] <coldhead> or words to that effect
[18:51:06] * coldhead np: mission of burma - trem two
[18:55:02] <tpayne> anyone here successfully used ZeroClipboard?
[18:55:39] <coldhead> for certain definitions of success, sure
[18:59:25] <madprops> i'm still waiting for a flashless clipboard manager >_<
[18:59:40] <coldhead> good luck with that
[19:00:14] <abjorn> http://images.t-nation.com/forum_images/2/0/20c9c_ORIG-op_will_deliver.jpg madprops in a year
[19:04:56] <tpayne> coldhead: I can't get mine to work how i want it to. I want to control when it actually copies
[19:05:07] <tpayne> maybe if i understood what's going on, i can manipulate it correctly
[19:06:28] <coldhead> i don't think it supports that, tpayne
[19:07:25] <coldhead> https://github.com/jonrohan/ZeroClipboard/blob/master/docs/instructions.md
[19:07:33] <coldhead> it really wants an element to bind a click handler too
[19:07:38] <tpayne> ok i'll play around with it, whatever it is, this is a super hack the way it works
[19:07:47] <coldhead> and i GUESS because it's flash you can't trigger the click from jQ
[19:08:38] <tpayne> ha, this is nuts
[19:08:51] <tpayne> the transparent flash movie receives the click event, wow
[19:09:21] <tpayne> no wonder this doesn't work, or only works when i click twice, ha. Ok thanks, now that i know how it works, i can do my own hacking
[19:10:25] <coldhead> good luck little buddy
[19:55:22] <JohnnyCache> any idea how to catch "unexpected token" error (js, chrome) at line 1? :(
[19:57:48] <reed1> JohnnyCache: jsfiddle it, please
[19:58:42] <JohnnyCache> reed1: n/m found it, thanks :)
[19:59:45] <reed1> snooooow problem
[19:59:52] <reed1> sounded like a pretty easy find
[20:00:05] <JohnnyCache> had href="javascript:void()"
[20:00:08] <JohnnyCache> forgot the 0
[20:00:09] <JohnnyCache> -.-
[20:01:57] <coldhead> with his arms upstretched
[20:02:13] <reed1> JohnnyCache: I've never seen this void(0) thing, just looked it up. Why wouldn't one just have an <a> with no href? or href="#"
[20:02:48] <coldhead> href="#" is definitely preferred
[20:04:34] <reed1> coldhead: word
[20:04:52] <JohnnyCache> coldhead: yeah, but the thing is that "#" scrolls to top and i dont want it
[20:05:04] <JohnnyCache> unless you have a nice way to avoid it
[20:05:11] <coldhead> then write some more JS to preventDefault when the href="#"
[20:05:22] <coldhead> still far better than pissing a million bits of useless JS into your HTML
[20:06:10] <JohnnyCache> coldhead: how about that: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/134845/href-attribute-for-javascript-links-or-javascriptvoid0 ?
[20:07:56] <coldhead> who are you going to believe, some guy on IRC or some guy from some karma whoring site?
[20:08:11] <coldhead> me i'd get out of web stuff entirely and shoot for landscape gardening
[20:08:51] <JohnnyCache> hehe
[20:08:56] <reed1> "karma whoring site" hah love it
[20:09:07] <tw2113> reddit?
[20:09:44] <JohnnyCache> well, i consider myself as an expert at js but i believe you always can learn more if you're hungry for that :)
[20:10:00] <richcollins> Can you use slideDown to hide something?
[20:10:23] <richcollins> I'd like to have an element slideDown and be hidden while another slideDown to replace it
[20:10:35] <richcollins> sort of like an odometer
[20:11:42] <reed1> richcollins: Afraid I don't understand. Can't see an odometer that way
[20:12:01] <richcollins> reed1: As one element slides down another slides in from above to replace it
[20:12:51] <coldhead> JohnnyCache: the opinion of many in #jQUery is that having ANY JS in your HTML is a Bad Thing
[20:12:57] <coldhead> and basically everyone who is right agrees with me
[20:13:26] <reed1> coldhead: You are a master arguer. JohnnyCache you have your work cut out for you.
[20:13:56] <reed1> richcollins: Is what you're imagining kind of like a scrolling billboard?
[20:14:14] <tw2113> gross inline js
[20:14:19] <coldhead> you see?
[20:18:35] <reed1> I agree with coldhead, but only because i want to be right
[20:19:29] <aMoniker> Does anyone know if it's possible to bind a specific scope when using $(element).trigger('whatnot'); ?
[20:19:40] <reed1> ya!
[20:19:43] <reed1> use $.bind!
[20:19:55] <tw2113> ?on
[20:20:06] <aMoniker> reed1, tw2113: I'm using on
[20:20:06] <tw2113> the bot fails me doesn't it
[20:20:13] <coldhead> `api on
[20:20:13] <b-ot> coldhead: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[20:20:19] <coldhead> we're making do without bot-t
[20:20:33] <aMoniker> ah ok, I think I see where my mistake is, nm :)
[20:21:33] <reed1> I see where my mistake was too, my answer didn't make any sense :)
[20:23:34] <reed1> Are there docs for the channel bot(s)?
[20:23:55] <coldhead> kinda https://github.com/gf3/IRC-js
[20:24:42] <reed1> Oh i meant for the house bots' library
[20:25:33] <coldhead> the bot who is offline is much better documented http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_bot_commands
[20:25:36] <coldhead> hope that helps :D
[20:26:00] <reed1> gotcha
[20:28:05] <coldhead> good chat everyone, let's take a short break
[20:30:02] <aMoniker> so I'm using $('form.variations_form').on('whatnot')
[20:30:11] <aMoniker> which works for all those forms on the page
[20:30:27] <aMoniker> but then I .clone(true, true) one of those forms, and put it in a lightbox
[20:30:39] <aMoniker> at which point it no longer receives the 'whatnot' event
[20:31:47] <reed1> clones won't get the event handlers
[20:31:52] <reed1> (to my knowledge)
[20:32:14] <reed1> oh i see this now
[20:32:31] <reed1> Learning somethin new every day :-D
[20:32:51] <coldhead> aMoniker: if you just have one handler for all your forms then you can probably use delegation
[20:33:16] <coldhead> $(document).on('whatnot', 'form.variations_form', ... )
[20:33:28] <aMoniker> coldhead: that didn't seem to be working either
[20:33:28] <coldhead> obviously you should use something more specific than document
[20:33:39] <coldhead> it works fine in my imagination :(
[20:33:44] <coldhead> i'm so happy there
[20:33:49] <coldhead> and so young
[20:37:14] <aMoniker> I'm using $('body').on('click', 'something');
[20:37:30] <aMoniker> and in that handler getting a $variations_form, and doing $variations_form.trigger('whatnot');
[20:37:50] <aMoniker> if I keep the 'whatnot' handler on body, this refers to body, and not the form
[20:38:03] <coldhead> it sounds like you want it on the form
[20:38:12] <coldhead> but HOW are you binding the event handler for the form?
[20:38:18] <coldhead> with an undelegated on?
[20:38:24] <aMoniker> when I did $('body').on('whatnot', 'form.variations_form')
[20:38:29] <coldhead> oh right
[20:38:34] <coldhead> then i'd expect that to work
[20:38:35] <aMoniker> it wasn't receiving the event at all
[20:38:42] <coldhead> and if it didn't i would go and cry
[20:39:05] <coldhead> you do realise that the 'whatnot' handler won't be run by triggering 'click'
[20:39:09] <coldhead> of course you do
[20:39:53] <aMoniker> $form_variations.trigger('whatnot');
[20:40:02] <reed1> jsfiddle? <3
[20:40:26] <aMoniker> could it be because I'm using clone(true, true) on the form and putting the clone into a lightbox?
[20:41:40] <coldhead> if you're using delegation it shouldn't matter where you put the form
[20:41:44] <coldhead> or how you obtain it
[20:41:57] <coldhead> if there is a form in body then the delegated handler should fire
[20:43:03] <coldhead> i second the call to jsfiddle
[20:43:20] <ValsiS> Hello

[22:02:44] <lovesh> is there some jquery plugin to get these kind of transition effects as on this link http://www.think.eu/people/article/lee-allen#lee-allen-anchor
[22:05:56] <innociv__> transit has a lot
[22:13:46] <kinesis> i need to make a button (id="b_hint") interface with a jQuery function that calls .ajax and pulls from a PHP script. How? .click doesnt work
[22:15:57] <coldhead> lovesh: it looks like a customised version of masonry/isotope
[22:16:05] <lovesh> @innociv__ Can you tell me some specific one for this or maybe somewhere where i can look for it
[22:16:17] <coldhead> kinesis: how does it not work?
[22:16:21] <coldhead> can we see the code?
[22:17:02] <kinesis> ill mess with it. i have to hack harder.
[22:19:40] <coldhead> kinesis: http://jsfiddle.net/EhRWB/
[22:19:42] <coldhead> totes works for me
[22:20:00] <coldhead> hail to thee, Eviltwin
[22:24:00] <lovesh> coldhead: I am new to jquery ui. Can you tell me how can i modify that to achieve the desired behavior?
[22:24:26] <kinesis> $("b_hint").click(function(){ alert("warning");
[22:24:38] <coldhead> kinesis: you need #b_hint for an id
[22:24:45] <coldhead> # == id
[22:24:59] <kinesis> i thought that was for divs. ok
[22:25:03] <coldhead> lovesh: it is not part of jQuery UI and it is not easy to modify it to act like that
[22:29:04] <kinesis> http://jsfiddle.net/hEyCQ/
[22:29:08] <kinesis> that is the fiddle
[22:33:16] <coldhead> this looks good to me, kinesis
[22:33:28] <coldhead> when i change the URL to '/' to get it to load from jsfiddle it works
[22:33:31] <coldhead> i mean, the data doesn't work
[22:33:36] <coldhead> but an ajax request is made
[22:38:33] <kinesis> the alert doesnt pop up
[22:39:58] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/hEyCQ/2/
[22:39:59] <coldhead> it does for me
[22:40:03] <coldhead> do you have jQuery included?
[22:40:45] <kinesis> i got it to work. ok
[22:41:05] <coldhead> great stuff
[22:51:10] <kinesis> it does nothing on my scrpt when i click hint. it works on js fiddle though, odd
[22:52:02] <coldhead> do you see any errors in the console?
[22:52:17] <coldhead> i need a fix cos i'm going down
[22:52:46] <kinesis> no
[22:52:57] <kinesis> im infirefox, it has this cool 3d view.
[22:53:07] <kinesis> but debugger says nothing really.
[22:53:34] <coldhead> try putting the alert() outside the click handler
[22:53:38] <coldhead> just in the main JS
[22:53:41] <coldhead> see if that shows
[22:53:55] <coldhead> is your code wrapped in $(document).ready() ?
[22:54:07] <kinesis> ok ill do that
[22:54:26] <kinesis> im rusty on my jquery
[22:54:27] <coldhead> you can also try pasting your code into the console and seeing if it works there
[22:57:46] <kinesis> [22:57:26.178] SyntaxError: missing ; before statement @ http://127.0.0.1/beergame/js/beergame.js:9
[22:58:14] <coldhead> that sounds like the error to be investigating
[22:58:33] <coldhead> http://www.jshint.com/
[22:59:04] <kinesis> http://jsfiddle.net/hEyCQ/3/
[22:59:14] <kinesis> i updated it. is that correct sructure and syntax?
[22:59:58] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/hEyCQ/4/
[23:00:01] <coldhead> `api ready
[23:00:01] <b-ot> coldhead: .ready(): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[23:00:15] <coldhead> thanks b-ot
[23:00:42] <kinesis> oh i forgot function
[23:02:02] <coldhead> yes

[23:13:18] <prageck> Hi!
[23:13:21] <chee> Hi!
[23:14:33] <prageck> How can I get the offset of an element relative to the window?
[23:14:38] <prageck> I have tried using element.offset().top - $( document ).scrollTop()
[23:15:00] <prageck> It works if an element is relative but It wont work for a fixed element
[23:16:10] <coldhead> prageck: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3714628/jquery-getting-location-of-element-relative-to-window
[23:18:01] <enerel> Heeeelp
[23:18:28] <prageck> coldhead: Hey, I think this method will not work if the element is fixed
[23:19:04] <enerel> http://jsfiddle.net/tZ4YQ/ start date change back is not affecting end date
[23:19:06] <prageck> For example I want to find the top offset of the input box of a facebook chat popup
[23:19:55] <prageck> coldhead: Since its offset().top is always fixed, I can not subtract the scrolltop value from it
[23:20:32] <hlve> Hey guys :S
[23:20:42] <chee> Hey hlve S:
[23:20:51] <hlve> How goes your Monday night? :o
[23:20:54] <coldhead> i don't know anything about that prageck, it's my first day using jQuery
[23:21:02] <noaXess> morning
[23:21:09] <hlve> true.
[23:21:19] <prageck> coldhead: Oh, thanks anyways.
[23:21:40] <prageck> Anyone?
[23:21:50] <chee> it's everyone's first day using jQuery
[23:22:04] <tw2113> my first day isn't till tomorrow
[23:23:17] <hlve> new job?
[23:23:28] <tw2113> no, for using jquery
[23:23:31] <hlve> Ah
[23:23:37] <hlve> well, enjoy!
[23:23:39] <hlve> it's fun.
[23:24:00] <tw2113> i know :)
[23:24:07] <noaXess> does anybody use different ui themes on same side, webapp?
[23:27:43] <coldhead> i don't understand, enerel
[23:27:51] <coldhead> the way it behaves now makes sense to me
[23:28:06] <coldhead> if i book may 15 i can checkout may 16
[23:28:24] <coldhead> if i change may 15 to may 17 checkout goes to may 18
[23:28:28] <coldhead> all good
[23:28:29] <coldhead> case closed
[23:30:40] <coldhead> enerel: oh i see, you need to add some code to change the "disable" stuff in the checkin dateChange handle
[23:30:43] <coldhead> handler*
[23:30:46] <coldhead> capiche?
[23:30:49] <coldhead> great work everyone
[23:30:50] <coldhead> case closed
