[00:05:30] <silv3r_m00n> hi there
[00:05:54] <silv3r_m00n> i need to remove the first N occurences of a selection, $('.class').first(100).remove()  something like that, how ?
[00:06:11] <Cork> ?api slice
[00:06:11] <b-ot> Cork: .slice(): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[00:09:21] <anli> I want to take a dom structure and put in an iframe (change parent), trying $iframe.find('body').html(foo); without success
[00:09:39] <Cork> ?.contents
[00:09:46] <Cork> ?api contents
[00:09:46] <b-ot> Cork: .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[00:09:51] <anli> ah
[00:09:56] <Cork> anli: iframes are a separate document
[00:10:02] <anli> yes
[00:15:04] <anli> I need to detach before appending to something else, right?
[00:19:18] <Cork> i suspect you need to serialize it
[00:19:38] <Cork> cause it is dom object from a foraging dom document
[00:19:51] <anli> Maybe I should reuse the html then
[00:20:05] <anli> Not tampering with the dom
[00:20:39] <anli> To not seek for problems
[00:21:22] <anli> Will also give less code
[00:21:52] <anli> Because I need to put the content back from the iframe under certain circumstances, then I only need to .hide and .show it
[00:29:07] <sammych> arschmitz: are you there buddy?

[01:25:40] <dreamhawk> Hello, this should be an easy one for you .. :) I append x number of images, and i want to caption them with capty (i use getJSON to get data and append to div), but how can i initialize capty on the appended data?
[01:27:09] <airdem> hi guys
[01:27:51] <WG1337> Hi! Anyone knows a nice plugin that would allow me to add 2 or more input fields with a single click?
[01:28:24] <doug65536> WG1337:  you don't need a plugin, that's very easy
[01:28:26] <Cork> dreamhawk: you mean you want to set an attribute on the img tag or what?
[01:30:01] <doug65536> WG1337: $('#somewhere').append($('<input>').attr('name', 'something').addClass('someclass'))
[01:30:51] <Cork> or simply $('#somewhere').append('<input name="something"><input name="something">')
[01:31:08] <WG1337> So this will insert an input tag inside #somewhere block?
[01:31:20] <Cork> append, but ya
[01:31:26] <Cork> you can use prepend too
[01:31:45] <doug65536> WG1337: yes, at the end. there are various ways to control where the new object will go
[01:34:06] <WG1337> Ok, thanks, will try it out!
[01:36:16] <doug65536> silly me. earlier I was baffled why jquery didn't have a json encoder. duh! JSON.stringify :D
[01:36:40] <Cork> :)
[01:36:47] <dreamhawk> Cork: yeah, i have .append("<img src='' alt='foo' id='d' />"), then i want $("#d").capty() on all the appended images
[01:37:22] <Cork> dreamhawk:  $("#d img").capty()
[01:37:42] <airdem> can you guys suggest a frameowrk for working with canvas?
[01:39:10] <Cork> airdem: depends on what you want to do
[01:40:00] <airdem> Cork, an app for designing rooms
[01:40:19] <Cork> so you want a frameword for creating objects or what?
[01:40:24] <dreamhawk> Cork: hmm, got "Selector invalid or missing!"
[01:40:53] <Cork> dreamhawk: oh missed that you have id on the img tag
[01:41:11] <Cork> dreamhawk: id's are uniq you can't have them on multiple elements
[01:41:13] <airdem> Cork, yes creating obj and moving them in a "room"
[01:41:26] <Cork> airdem: not sure there is one
[01:41:54] <dreamhawk> Cork: ooh.. thank you
[01:41:56] <airdem> Cork, found fabricjs and kineticjs but im not sure what i want :P
[01:57:22] <tankblergh> hey hey! Does anyone know any way of debugging a site on an iPad?
[01:57:49] <tankblergh> works on every desktopbrowser and andriod, but not IOS
[01:58:06] <seutje> ?g remote debugging ios
[01:58:06] <b-ot> seutje: Enable Remote Debugging with Safari Web Inspector in iOS 6 ... â†’ http://moduscreate.com/enable-remote-web-inspector-in-ios-6/
[01:58:32] <tankblergh> aha, thanks, I'll take a look
[01:59:03] <tankblergh> christ, you need a mac
[01:59:09] <tankblergh> ok
[01:59:13] <seutje> tankblergh: u can also remotely debug android or anything else on the webkits
[02:00:08] <tankblergh> so I can debug chrome on ipad remotely without a mac?
[02:00:28] <seutje> not entirely sure, but I do believe so
[02:00:34] <Ericx2x> I have a JS slider on one of my pages. But then I try adding some more JS that made light boxes. The lightboxes JS screwed up my slider JS... http://jsfiddle.net/wK5ED/
[02:01:03] <Ericx2x> If i remove the <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script> line from my JS the slider works but the light boxes dont
[02:01:19] <Ericx2x> and vice versa if i keep the same line of code the lighboxes work but the slider doesnt
[02:01:28] <Ericx2x> anyone know how to get both working?
[02:01:45] <seutje> or wait, isn't iOS chrome just a UIWebView instead of a real chrome?
[02:02:20] <tankblergh> it appears so from something I'm reading now
[02:02:33] <seutje> yeah... crApple can be like that
[02:03:32] <tankblergh> ok, thanks for the help, maybe I can find someone with mac around here somewhere :)
[02:04:15] <anew> so if i am using append() on a php form
[02:04:29] <anew> does the html from append not get sent to the server when the user submits?
[02:04:32] <anew> it shows in the DOM
[02:04:36] <anew> but i cant get the POST variable
[02:04:37] <seutje> Ericx2x: I don't see the slideshow code anywhere
[02:04:58] <Cork> anew: the html is never sent, but yes the values will be grabbed in a normal submit
[02:05:14] <anew> cork i mean since it is appended after the page has loaded
[02:05:27] <Cork> anew: doesn't matter
[02:05:34] <anew> hmmm ok
[02:05:38] <remybach> anew: double check that you're appending with a name attribute.
[02:06:12] <anew> thx
[02:06:45] <Ericx2x> seutje the slideshow script is at the bottom
[02:07:33] <Ericx2x> basically i think i have too much js on one page
[02:07:36] <seutje> you know, there's a reason jsfiddle has 3 inputs that are labelled accordingly
[02:08:00] <seutje> horseshit, gmail runs 17 times that amount
[02:08:24] <Ericx2x> well the issue is one piece of js code is screwing up the other
[02:08:34] <Ericx2x> the way i had it before is that i had both js code on different pages
[02:08:48] <Ericx2x> but then i realized i wanted them both on one page
[02:08:54] <Ericx2x> then the slider stopped working
[02:08:57] <Ericx2x> when i tried that
[02:10:51] <seutje> I can't even find where you include the nivo slider library
[02:11:25] <Ericx2x> lol i cant either
[02:11:28] <Ericx2x> but it works
[02:11:37] <Ericx2x> i'm not sure why i dont need to include the library somewhere...
[02:11:47] <Ericx2x> oh i think that might be related to my issue
[02:12:05] <seutje> :|
[02:12:17] <Ericx2x> isnt there something that has <script> not needing to be included?
[02:12:23] <Ericx2x> like older versions required the include
[02:12:39] <Ericx2x> the new version doesnt?
[02:12:46] <seutje> sry, what?
[02:12:57] <seutje> browser magically know what libraries you're going to use?
[02:13:04] <Ericx2x> yea
[02:13:20] <seutje> cool, this really is the future
[02:16:52] <seutje> Ericx2x: nivoSlider requires jQuery 1.7 or above btw
[02:17:03] <seutje> took me a while to find it
[02:17:20] <seutje> it's hidden behind the download link, instead of in the actual documentation
[02:17:38] <seutje> good thing I searched the source instead :/
[02:17:55] <Ericx2x> thanks
[02:17:57] <Ericx2x> give me a sec
[02:18:02] <Ericx2x> tinkering about
[02:19:19] <Ericx2x> dang
[02:19:25] <Ericx2x> i figured out the issue sort of
[02:19:48] <Ericx2x> the js code for the slider is a different fersion of jquery
[02:19:52] <Ericx2x> than the other js code
[02:20:15] <seutje> yeah, that's what I was suspecting
[02:20:49] <Ericx2x> anyone know of some work around?
[02:54:57] <doug65536> Ericx2x: it is possible for more than one version of jquery to coexist on a page, if you must
[02:55:05] <doug65536> Ericx2x: use .noConflict()
[02:56:10] <doug65536> Ericx2x: when "your" jquery loads, jquery saves a backup of $ and JQuery internally. Calling jQuery.noConflict() restores that backup to the old values and returns a reference to the new jquery
[02:57:32] <doug65536> Ericx2x: so you can do var $2 = JQuery.noConflict() and your version of jquery can be used using $2 instead of $, while existing code can happily keep using JQuery and $
[03:07:02] <Ericx2x> doug65536 thanks for the help i'm still a bit confused on how the coexist can happen
[03:07:11] <anew> http://pastebin.com/8fpdbNbi can anyone help here, this append works, but when i submit the form there is no POST variable for it !
[03:07:51] <doug65536> Ericx2x: noConflict rolls back the changes it made to window.$ and window.jQuery, then returns "itself" so you can store it to whatever you like (instead of $)
[03:08:15] <doug65536> Ericx2x: I'm making a demo fiddle
[03:08:19] <Ericx2x> wait
[03:08:23] <Ericx2x> let me start one
[03:08:56] <harryhcs> hey, i have a droppable div, inside it there is also a img. I don't want the image indie it to be droppable, how would I do this?
[03:11:12] <Ericx2x> doug65536 http://jsfiddle.net/9Cc8B/2/
[03:13:24] <daslicht> wht event getss fired when a user confirms a file selection in a file dialog ?
[03:13:39] <daslicht> when he hes 'open'
[03:15:25] <Cork> change if i remember correctly
[03:15:42] <airdem> why is wrap() not working here? http://jsfiddle.net/mncGV/
[03:16:21] <daslicht> yeah its change , i just tried it , thanks Cork!
[03:17:05] <airdem> oh i have to wrap after append...
[03:17:17] <Cork> airdem: cause you first append it to the li, then move it to the ul
[03:17:29] <Cork> so the li gets left behind
[03:17:38] <airdem> thank you for explaining
[03:17:59] <Cork> airdem: you prob want to do $('<li />').append(floor[i]).appendTo instead
[03:18:35] <doug65536> Ericx2x: you have roughly the right idea
[03:18:51] <doug65536> Ericx2x: noConflict restores its backup of $ and jQuery and returns itself
[03:19:04] <doug65536> Ericx2x: something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/9Cc8B/6/
[03:19:11] <doug65536> not sure which plugins require which versions
[03:19:48] <Ericx2x> doug65536 thanks i'll try to poke around w/ this
[03:19:49] <doug65536> just lightbox requires the old jq?
[03:19:55] <Ericx2x> yes
[03:22:42] <doug65536> Ericx2x: ok, so load the old jq, then load the lightbox plugin, then do the noconflict, then load the new one, and whatever normal version plugins, and it should work. that's how it is supposed to work anyway, with correctly implemented plugins
[03:23:20] <doug65536> Ericx2x: the plugin author documentation is crystal clear about properly handling $
[03:23:22] <Ericx2x> ok give me a few minutes
[03:25:50] <Cork> airdem: just throwing it out there http://jsfiddle.net/mncGV/2/
[03:26:16] <Ericx2x> doug65536 what do you mean by plugin author documentation
[03:26:34] <airdem> Cork, thank you
[03:26:36] <doug65536> Ericx2x: the jquery documentation for people that make jquery plugins
[03:27:32] <doug65536> Ericx2x: if you step through this code, you can see that it is setting a click handler in each different version, all on the same page http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/v4uyG/8/
[03:28:57] <doug65536> I'll add your really old version to test it
[03:30:43] <anew> is selectingn from a drop down "change" jq event ?
[03:30:44] <hellyeah> hey
[03:30:56] <hellyeah> where is jquery 1.10.1 appearently jsffidle use this.
[03:31:01] <hellyeah> And i need that file
[03:31:42] <Ericx2x> hellyeah: 	<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.1/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[03:31:49] <Ericx2x> not sure if that works tho
[03:31:57] <Ericx2x> doug65536 I'm still confused
[03:32:25] <Ericx2x> http://jsfiddle.net/9Cc8B/8/
[03:32:28] <Ericx2x> that still doesn't work
[03:32:31] <doug65536> Ericx2x: this works for me http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/v4uyG/12/
[03:33:07] <doug65536> Ericx2x: <script src="js/page-load.js" type="text/javascript">$1.6.1 =    jQuery.noConflict();    </script>    <-- doesn't make sense
[03:33:29] <doug65536> Ericx2x: do that in a script tag with no src
[03:33:47] <Ericx2x> oh
[03:34:05] <Ericx2x> i dont need to load those src?
[03:34:22] <doug65536> do the $1.6.1 =    jQuery.noConflict();  in its own script tag
[03:34:38] <doug65536> you can't just throw code into a script with a src
[03:34:57] <Cork> $1.6.1 won't be a valid variable name
[03:35:06] <Ericx2x> oh ok
[03:35:09] <doug65536> yeah, that too :)
[03:35:32] <Cork> $1_6_1 is the closest you can get
[03:36:07] <doug65536> if you had a gun to your head, window["$1.6.1"] would work :D   but don't
[03:36:51] <Cork> >_<
[03:40:54] <anew> cork what is the js event for selecting a drop down
[03:40:56] <anew> change /
[03:41:09] <Cork> ya
[03:41:20] <Cork> anew: that or click
[03:41:32] <anew> weird
[03:41:33] <anew> k thx
[03:42:32] <Ericx2x> Still not sure what I'm doing wrong here..
[03:42:32] <Ericx2x> http://jsfiddle.net/9Cc8B/10/
[03:42:55] <hellyeah> Ericx2x:  it worked
[03:43:22] <doug65536> Ericx2x: you have noconflict twice
[03:43:28] <gadago> hi, Im trying to apply some css to this jquery validation script but having no luck http://www.magicedit.com/EasyFormValidationwi.cl It seems it adds class="required error" to the input field when the script runs
[03:43:52] <Ericx2x> ok i need to wrap my brain around this more
[03:43:53] <Ericx2x> sec
[03:43:58] <doug65536> Ericx2x: that effectively makes jQuery not work, only $ works
[03:44:10] <gadago> I just want to change the background to red if it fails, but the #contactform.required.error I'm using doesn't seem to apply anything
[03:44:13] <gadago> any ideas?
[03:44:27] <anew> http://paste.ee/p/hDvtd is that right for selecting from a drop down?
[03:44:29] <anew> not getting anything
[03:44:34] <doug65536> Ericx2x: remove the one in the javascript section, keep the script tag one
[03:44:44] <gadago> the validation itself seems to be working, it's just the css not applying
[03:45:24] <xqo> can you .each more than one thing? like $.each($("#button_sort_by_name")+$("#button_sort_by_price")) or something like that?
[03:45:44] <anew> weird it works in fiddle hmmm
[03:45:46] <Cork> Xgc: $.each($("#button_sort_by_name").add($("#button_sort_by_price")))
[03:45:47] <Ericx2x> doug65536 http://jsfiddle.net/9Cc8B/11/
[03:45:54] <Ericx2x> still not what i want tho
[03:46:10] <doug65536> Ericx2x: you still aren't doing it right...
[03:46:10] <Ericx2x> its not workign like it should
[03:46:26] <Cork> Xgc: through you prob want $("#button_sort_by_name").add($("#button_sort_by_price")).each()
[03:46:30] <Ericx2x> oh hold on let me reread what you said and double check
[03:47:03] <doug65536> Ericx2x: 1) load old jquery, 2) load old jquery plugins, 3) do the noConflict, 4) load the new jquery, 5) load the new jquery plugins if any,    now, when initializing old jquery plugins, use the old jquery $1_6_1
[03:47:31] <doug65536> Ericx2x: the way you have it, you use new jquery to initialize old jquery plugin
[03:47:43] <Ericx2x> ok thanks give me a while
[03:49:36] <doug65536> Ericx2x: to be crystal clear: you loaded nivoslider as a plugin to 1.6.1, then in your code, you use 1.9.1 to try to initialize nivoSlider, which can't work
[03:51:35] <doug65536> Ericx2x: picture it this way: when a plugin loads, it loads into the last jquery to load. that's why I'm telling you that it matters what order you do it
[03:52:03] <doug65536> Ericx2x: if you had to you could switch the references around and make it load a plugin into any one, but why bother
[03:53:13] <doug65536> Ericx2x: or more precisely, when a plugin is loaded, it plugs itself into whatever jQuery is referring to
[03:54:30] <Ericx2x> Ok, that's beginning to make sense now.
[03:54:41] <Ericx2x> however i'm tinkering w/ it and i still dont have both working... http://jsfiddle.net/9Cc8B/12/
[03:55:13] <doug65536> nivoslider is still using the wrong $
[03:55:31] <doug65536> use: var slider = $1_6_1('#slider');
[03:55:47] <Ericx2x> oh ok
[03:56:04] <doug65536> oh wait
[03:56:13] <doug65536> no, you put nivoslider after 1.9.1
[03:56:16] <doug65536> so that is right now
[03:56:25] <Ericx2x> oh okay..
[03:56:28] <doug65536> leave it as $('#slider')
[03:56:31] <Ericx2x> ok
[03:56:48] <Ericx2x> give me a sec
[03:56:59] <Ericx2x> i think it might be working correctly but the lightbox is acting strange
[03:57:34] <doug65536> well, maybe lightbox isn't written properly...
[03:57:40] <doug65536> you could reverse it...
[03:58:00] <Ericx2x> yeah not sure why the lightbox doesnt work
[03:58:03] <Ericx2x> ill try reversing it
[03:58:12] <doug65536> if you put <script type="text/javascript"> $1_9_1 =  $.noConflict();   </script>   after jquery 1.9.1 then $ and jQuery will be 1.6.1
[03:59:49] <Ericx2x> do you mean like so? http://jsfiddle.net/9Cc8B/13/
[04:00:01] <Ericx2x> now the lightbox works but the slider doesn't..
[04:00:52] <doug65536> Ericx2x: more like this http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/9Cc8B/15/
[04:01:28] <doug65536> Ericx2x: you might want page-load.js up after 1.9.1 - I have no idea what that is
[04:02:02] <doug65536> I'll add some comments to hopefully make it make more sense
[04:02:10] <Ericx2x> page-load is for the lightbox
[04:03:12] <Ericx2x> do i need to add $1_9_1
[04:03:14] <doug65536> Ericx2x: do these comments help http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/9Cc8B/16/
[04:03:16] <Ericx2x> on each $
[04:03:21] <Ericx2x> for the bottom script?
[04:05:07] <doug65536> Ericx2x: what is the point of that getelements stuff?
[04:05:09] <Ericx2x> yay, works :-)
[04:05:14] <Ericx2x> and i understand it now too.. lol
[04:05:15] <doug65536> Ericx2x: isn't that what jquery is for?
[04:05:19] <doug65536> cool
[04:06:18] <Ericx2x> thanks for pointing that out
[04:06:33] <Ericx2x> i guess the getelements stuff was some code from someone else
[04:06:38] <Ericx2x> i removed it and it works still
[04:07:27] <Ericx2x> by the way doug65536 did you manage to find work?
[04:07:35] <doug65536> not yet :(
[04:07:47] <Ericx2x> :(
[04:07:58] <Ericx2x> have you attempted to tap into resources?
[04:08:28] <doug65536> what do you mean?
[04:08:32] <Ericx2x> i noticed you have been helping a lot on this channel
[04:09:02] <Ericx2x> someone may realise that and give you an offer or opportunity
[04:09:34] <doug65536> yes, I've had a few people say they're going to give me contract/freelance work, but none has actually happened yet
[04:10:00] <Ericx2x> i've heard stories of people getting hired thru irc
[04:10:13] <Ericx2x> but i think it was something more niche
[04:10:28] <Ericx2x> like irc for a specific company or service
[04:11:13] <Ericx2x> try seeing whats around your area
[04:11:20] <Ericx2x> craigslist your area
[04:11:25] <doug65536> it's really good exercise on here. solving random problems / debugging through stuff is a fast way to gain expertise
[04:11:38] <Ericx2x> yeah
[04:12:09] <hazardous> hi
[04:12:09] <Ericx2x> i should be spending more time here
[04:12:12] <Ericx2x> i plan to in the future
[04:12:13] <doug65536> I worked pretty much for free with a couple of guys, with promises of paid work... we'll see
[04:12:20] <hazardous> may possibly be out of scope, but how can i strip off the first six characters from an ajax response
[04:12:25] <doug65536> I did some pretty complex stuff
[04:12:32] <hazardous> not really characters, but 'XPXX\x04\x01'
[04:12:38] <hazardous> can i do a .replace() if it's always going to be that?
[04:12:45] <doug65536> hazardous: don't do that
[04:12:53] <doug65536> hazardous: fix the problem, not the symptoms
[04:13:05] <doug65536> hazardous: but if you must, .substr(6)
[04:13:29] <hazardous> doug65536: what do you mean
[04:13:33] <hazardous> oh, it's out of my control
[04:13:42] <hazardous> i'm just reading another datasource
[04:13:53] <clime> hey can you set body height like this? $('body').height(200); It doesn't quite work for me.
[04:13:57] <doug65536> hazardous: you're sure it's always 6 characters?
[04:14:02] <hazardous> it's always going to be XPXX\x04\x01
[04:14:33] <doug65536> hazardous: then do var my_result = JSON.parse(my_json.substr(6))
[04:14:41] <hazardous> ok, thanks
[04:14:56] <hazardous> \x04 and \x01 are one char each right?
[04:15:01] <doug65536> right
[04:15:16] <hazardous> \uXXXX is the multichar?
[04:15:28] <doug65536> no, it's one character too
[04:15:41] <doug65536> a character has no relationship with bytes
[04:15:48] <doug65536> 1 byte != 1 character
[04:15:53] <doug65536> in utf8 anyway
[04:16:21] <clime> this kinda works $('body').width(100); but this doesn't $('body').height(100);
[04:16:24] <doug65536> 1 character MAY be 1 byte though
[04:16:49] <doug65536> in a string, a character is a character, you don't care how many bytes it would be in utf8
[04:20:11] <doug65536> hazardous: it depends on how you got that information... it may well be a \ followed by a u followed by 4 characters, which is 6 characters just for \u0000  but in source code \u0000  is one character
[04:21:32] <doug65536> js> print('XPXX\x04\x01'.length)
[04:21:41] <b-ot> doug65536: 6
[04:22:15] <doug65536> js> print('\u1234'.length)
[04:22:23] <b-ot> doug65536: 1
[04:24:54] <doug65536> hazardous: ^
[04:25:17] <doug65536> clime: define "works". what were you expecting?
[04:26:26] <sl33k> hi
[04:26:54] <sl33k> Please how can I target: <a class="accordion-toggle"> in jquery? this fails: $("a .accordion-toggle") :(
[04:27:20] <clime> doug65536: not sure. i expect some change in style but I guess it is nonsense to set values lower than window height/width
[04:27:26] <slax0r> no space between a and .
[04:27:58] <slax0r> if you put a space it means you're searching for a child element of <a> with that class
[04:28:02] <doug65536> sl33k: with the space, you are saying, find children of a that are class accordion-toggle
[04:28:38] <ohcibi> does anyone know an api for the <video> events.. i'm interest in the timeupdate event and what arguments are passed to the callback
[04:28:58] <sl33k> doug65536: would i need to do this? $("a .accordion-toggle *")
[04:29:46] <slax0r> sl33k, see my reply..
[04:30:10] <slax0r> space = children
[04:31:07] <doug65536> sl33k: what slax0r is saying is, you need to remove the space.
[04:31:10] <clime> fdoug65536: I am loading an iframe to a jquery dialog and I try to set the dialog sizes appropriate to the loaded content. the problem is I don't know how to read height of the content I have loaded
[04:31:37] <doug65536> clime: is the iframe src in the same domain as your page?
[04:31:41] <clime> doug65536: yes
[04:33:56] <clime> doug65536: If I read size of the iframe itself after the content has been loaded. I get the right values and it works. But then if, in iframe I navigate to a page that contains almost no content (only some text and button) I want to make the whole dialog smaller. The problem is that iframe still has size set from the previous content so I can't use that.
[04:34:28] <doug65536> clime: well, I don't think you can do that reliably. it's ugly, but when I do that I simply poll
[04:35:10] <doug65536> clime: like, every 2 seconds, "reach into" the iframe and get the document size
[04:35:18] <doug65536> and adjust the iframe itself
[04:35:54] <doug65536> why I think you can't do it reliably: when you get the load event, the iframe may be about to run some code that changes the size
[04:36:41] <clime> doug65536: well that is another thing. I believe (hope) that all the javascript from iframe is done after load event is spawned. Is that correct
[04:36:54] <doug65536> clime: is it? I don't think so. why would it be
[04:37:38] <doug65536> clime: it probably is, but you don't know... unless you do know
[04:38:07] <doug65536> in theory, the load event would bubble out into the page containing the iframe after the iframe document processes load
[04:38:16] <doug65536> that is just speculation though
[04:38:44] <ph88> does someone here know about select2 ?
[04:39:02] <doug65536> do events bubble up out of iframes like that? maybe, I haven't seen any documentation that says for sure
[04:39:42] <clime> doug65536: Well not sure, I am trying to confirm this information for a few hours already.
[04:39:56] <doug65536> clime: you know what really causes trouble? if you set the src of the iframe in the html, then you never know which document is going to "win" the race
[04:40:35] <doug65536> clime: I think there is a race condition. you can miss the load event if you don't set the src after hooking onload. if you set onload in the html, that will always work
[04:40:54] <clime> doug65536: i see. Well I construct the whole iframe from js and also I set src from there and bind to the load event.
[04:41:15] <doug65536> clime: ok, then first do your onload, THEN set the src attribute
[04:41:34] <clime> doug65536: cool,that makes sense
[04:42:09] <doug65536> at that point, it's somewhat safe to assume that you get your load event from the iframe after the iframe's code gets it
[04:42:59] <clime> doug65536: thanks.
[04:43:07] <doug65536> I am not sure about anything though. that seems to work for me - I might be superstitious about iframes because of past weird experiences :D
[04:43:31] <seutje> doesn't the window fire load in the parent document
[04:43:38] <seutje> granted they're not xdomain
[04:43:56] <clime> doug65536: it makes sense from what I have read before
[04:44:27] <doug65536> seutje: sure, but if you have src in the html as a hardcoded attribute, can't the iframe load fire before you get your outer document load?
[04:45:04] <doug65536> seutje: this assumes you don't have onload="something()" in the html
[04:45:26] <doug65536> seutje: and the outer document's onload tries to setup onload on the iframe
[04:45:39] <doug65536> seutje: see what I'm getting at?
[04:46:40] <doug65536> seutje: I could have sworn that I've "missed" the iframe load event
[04:47:38] <g33kyboi> hi there
[04:48:26] <sl33k> hi...kind i mix jquery and javascript together? I want to have a javascript function reinit some html components in my page
[04:48:37] <slax0r> sure
[04:48:37] <sl33k> because those doms werent present initially
[04:48:49] <sl33k> i mean register event handlers
[04:48:52] <slax0r> jquery IS javascript
[04:48:54] <doug65536> sl33k: what? jquery is javascript
[04:49:01] <seutje> doug65536: I always assume people don't use event handler attributes
[04:49:12] <slax0r> wow doug65536 really? are we like connected in some way? :P
[04:49:13] <doug65536> seutje: yes, me too
[04:49:40] <doug65536> slax0r: lol
[04:49:43] <sl33k> doug65536: like is this valid? http://pastebin.com/R4CDBA5F
[04:50:03] <slax0r> sl33k should be
[04:50:10] <slax0r> jsut run it, and check console for errors
[04:50:15] <slax0r> if it works, it's valid
[04:50:21] <seutje> cause jQuery never fails silently :P
[04:50:23] <doug65536> sl33k: why would you think it isn't?
[04:50:30] <slax0r> I really need to stop writting multiline answers :/
[04:50:44] <doug65536> sl33k: not happy about the missing ; but seems right at a glance
[04:50:51] <slax0r> seutje, when it fails, something doesn't work
[04:50:54] <seutje> sl33k: http://pastebin.com/KVFRaVJa you're welcome
[04:50:56] <sl33k> because when i try it, i get the function is not defined in chrome browser as error. also, it doesnt alert
[04:51:15] <doug65536> sl33k: you're probably running it too soon...
[04:51:27] <interop_madness> i have a problem with a $.ajax() call. it calls to a webservice which returns JSON data (which i have verified to be valid JSON) with Content-Type set to application/json, but still the $.ajax() call returns with a parser error.
[04:51:32] <seutje> missing a ) at the end
[04:51:33] <seutje> at least
[04:51:43] <seutje> indenting properly will show you this
[04:52:14] <doug65536> sl33k: it's not valid
[04:52:28] <interop_madness> is there some bug in jquery 1.10.2 in terms of JSON parsing or does jquery.ajax() only support a subset of JSON?
[04:52:58] <doug65536> sl33k: FTFY http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/k6TeE/
[04:53:23] <interop_madness> i'm leaning towards the bug being somewhere in jquery because the request usually works, only for certain request parameters the parser error occurs
[04:54:00] <doug65536> sl33k: however... you may need to move initActionDropDown outside the $(function() ...
[04:54:27] <doug65536> sl33k: $(function() { ... this stuff runs AFTER the document is ready ... });
[04:54:43] <seutje> made jshint cry :(
[04:55:11] <doug65536> sl33k: if that code is in <head> then it will run before anything on the page exists, so wrapping it like I described delays its execution until after the document is ready
[04:55:45] <sl33k> doug65536: it is ajax. i dont have access to head
[04:56:01] <sl33k> but the named function is in head already
[04:56:03] <doug65536> interop_madness: it's you.
[04:56:12] <seutje> the undefined function error was prolly due to the braces mismatch
[04:56:17] <doug65536> interop_madness: there's no way it's jquery
[04:56:23] <sl33k> 2) pls how can i access the "this" variable here: $("a.accordion-toggle").click() within the click function
[04:56:36] <sl33k> the element that caused the click
[04:56:39] <seutje> you type it out?
[04:56:47] <doug65536> interop_madness: php on server side? php is legendary for putting unexpected crap in the output on error
[04:57:08] <seutje> sl33k: what do u mean by "access" you can just go this.someproperty
[04:57:09] <sl33k> seutje: type what out? this doesnt work: this.attr('class', 'accordion-toggle active');
[04:57:12] <interop_madness> doug65536, other than that, i can only suspect character encoding issues
[04:57:19] <interop_madness> but it literally happens only in one special case
[04:57:34] <seutje> sl33k: this is a reference to the DOM element that triggered it, DOM elements don't have an attr method
[04:57:39] <sl33k> seutje: should it work please?
[04:57:42] <interop_madness> i could make the server return Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf8 instead
[04:57:51] <seutje> sl33k: jQuery collections do, so you first need to cast it to a jQuery collection by going $(this)
[04:57:59] <seutje> $(this).attr(...) works fine
[04:58:00] <sl33k> seutje: please what can i do.  oh that!
[04:58:08] <doug65536> interop_madness: you asked if it is possible for it to be a jquery bug -- well, I'd say that is 0% possibility. if you could show the actual server output or give me a link I can try to debug
[04:58:18] <seutje> that was odd
[04:58:29] <clime> I am going to set sizes manually from the content I load. Don't know how to do it another way:    $(function() {         if (window.parent) {             $('body').attr('data-box-width', 300);             $('body').attr('data-box-height', 200);         }     });
[04:58:32] <sl33k> didnt know that...just doing a quick hack. this solves my first problem. the function part though still doesnt work
[04:58:38] <seutje> if you change your mind halfway a sentence you're typing, u can just remove that bit and type something else
[04:58:45] <seutje> no need to go all post scriptum
[04:59:29] <clime> and then read those data attrs when I construct the iframe.
[04:59:43] <doug65536> clime: NEVER use .attr to set data
[04:59:48] <doug65536> clime: use .data
[05:00:12] <seutje> unless u actually want to set the attribute
[05:00:13] <doug65536> clime: jquery has a cache and won't even look at the attributes 2nd time
[05:00:25] <seutje> like when ur trying to grab it with something that isn't jQuery
[05:00:46] <sl33k> seutje: that for me? i dont understand
[05:01:07] <clime> doug65536: why? I do it quite for some time already and it always worked. I read it then with attr('data-box-height')
[05:01:12] <seutje> nah, was related to .data and .attr('data-foo')
[05:01:20] <seutje> clime: less performant
[05:01:23] <doug65536> clime: if you mix .data and .attr it will screw up
[05:01:32] <seutje> you're doing DOM manipulation when you probably shouldn't be
[05:02:07] <clime> seutje: I am aware of that but sometimes I want to use jquery selectors on data attrs and then I need to set it with attr
[05:02:25] <seutje> yeah, so like I said "unless you actually want to set the attribute"
[05:02:35] <clime> In this particular case, I don't need it, true, but also I am not very concerned about performance here
[05:02:37] <seutje> if you're just trying to toss data around, use the internal cache
[05:03:17] <doug65536> clime: .data('foo') reads the attributes right? WRONG! it does the first time, and from then on it looks at its internal cache
[05:04:30] <clime> doug65536: I am aware of that
[05:04:49] <doug65536> clime: ok, when I see .attr('data... it's a red flag for me :)
[05:05:24] <sl33k> seutje: is there an if statement in jquery. this hack doesnt work http://pastebin.com/NdwMLHWf
[05:05:44] <sl33k> cos it seems i cant register jquery dom events in advance
[05:05:54] <seutje> ?on
[05:06:01] <seutje> bot? :(
[05:06:09] <doug65536> sl33k: $("a.accordion-toggle active")   <--- doesn't make sense
[05:06:10] <seutje> sl33k: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[05:06:26] <seutje> sl33k: http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[05:06:38] <seutje> sl33k: http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[05:06:50] <sl33k> doug65536: was trying to achieve toggle
[05:06:59] <doug65536> sl33k: there is no "active" html tag
[05:07:22] <doug65536> sl33k: and there definitely isn't a child element of the anchor that is <active>
[05:07:31] <sl33k> X_X
[05:07:35] <sl33k> should have been .active
[05:07:37] <sl33k> ?
[05:07:48] <doug65536> sl33k: that would make sense... sure
[05:07:49] <seutje> $('a').on('click', '.accordion-toggle', function(e) { $(this).toggleClass('active'); });
[05:08:17] <doug65536> sl33k: however, it evaluates that selector once - it won't magically run different handlers based on whether it has class active
[05:08:24] <seutje> basically, register a handler on all links, if they have the accordion-toggle class when being clicked, toggle the active class
[05:08:39] <sl33k> seutje: sleek!
[05:08:41] <sl33k> elegant!
[05:09:01] <seutje> might be better to bind to a single element higher up
[05:09:02] <seutje> like
[05:09:06] <doug65536> sl33k: don't .attr('class'...  use addClass, removeClass, toggleClass
[05:09:12] <sl33k> seutje: any reason you use single semi colon>
[05:09:20] <seutje> $('body').on('click', 'a.accordion-toggle', function(e) { $(this).toggleClass('active'); });
[05:09:36] <seutje> what?
[05:09:44] <seutje> I used 2
[05:09:46] <clime> doug65536: can understand why. The thing is when I set data like this in the iframe: $('body').data('box-width', 300); I can't seem to read in the load event like this: frameElem.contents().find('body').data('box-width') - it returns undefined. With attrs it worked for me. I know I should understand what I am doing here but I don't.
[05:09:58] <seutje> one after toggleClass() and one after the on()
[05:10:29] <seutje> clime: cause they're using a different jQuery object
[05:10:36] <doug65536> clime: yes, if you have two separate jQuery instances (the outer document's and the iframe document's) then yes it does throw some complexity into it
[05:10:43] <lotus> hey, given a string like "Happy" I want to return "<span hidden>H</span><span>x</span><span>x</span><span>x</span><span hidden>a</span>...." and so on where each letter of happy is produced inside a hidden span and followed by visible "x" inside their own span (where x is actually a random character, but that's just charAt(Math.random())) -- Ideally, I'd like to do this on two or three lines.  I've done it here:  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6365323  I jus
[05:10:46] <amitprakash> Hi, for a page containing some jquery, i have a $.post function.. how do I ask the $.post to post it to the same url as the page loaded
[05:10:55] <doug65536> clime: as long as you don't rely on .data if you used .attr, you'll be ok
[05:10:55] <clime> i see
[05:10:56] <lotus> Is it possible to do such a thing in jQuery with just a couple of lines?
[05:11:02] <clime> cool!
[05:11:08] <sl33k> seutje: that code doesnt work for me
[05:11:19] <seutje> sl33k: are you running old jQuery?
[05:11:59] <seutje> clime: you can get at the jQuery object inside the iframe by calling it's global reference on that window object
[05:13:05] <doug65536> lotus: sounds like you are trying to do something malicious
[05:13:22] <seutje> clime: like frameElem.contentWindow.jQuery('body').data('box-width')
[05:13:29] <lotus> doug65536: not really, no.  I wrote the code to solve a programming interview question.  I'm trying to make it more elegant.
[05:13:37] <seutje> that way, you should be using the same jQuery object and thus the same internal cache
[05:13:40] <lotus> amitprakash: window.location.href
[05:14:18] <lotus> amitprakash: $.post({url: window.location.href });
[05:14:38] <lotus> doug65536: If I were trying to do something malicious, would you be more or less likely to help?  xD
[05:14:41] <doug65536> lotus: so put Happy with each letter in a span and have H a p p y all invisible, and put 5 visible x's after each letter?
[05:15:13] <lotus> doug65536: a random number of x's, and an arbitrary string.  "happy" was just an example.
[05:15:26] <doug65536> lotus: lol, I'm making a fiddle
[05:15:50] <interop_madness> doug65536, it seems that the error is thrown in a subsequent call. some $.ajax() calls before, the json contains a value with "??". what's curious is that a later request fails because of this, i.e. if i remove the "??", the later request works
[05:15:55] <lotus> doug65536: baller.  I'm really curious.  The "defuzzing" part was really easy... just .find("span[hidden]").text()
[05:16:07] <amitprakash> lotus, must I specify the url? Why doesn't it work like a form in which action attribute isn't set?
[05:16:09] <lotus> wondering if I over-thought the fuzzing part
[05:16:24] <ph88> does someone here know about select2 ?
[05:17:00] <lotus> amitprakash: url is a required parameter, according to the docs
[05:17:32] <lotus> interop_madness: reading that made me feel "oh, race condition" but I didn't think about it too much...
[05:17:57] <dcope> is there a way to add an event handler for all items on a page even if they're added after a page load, which is where im attaching them nwo?
[05:18:02] <lotus> ph88: I've used select2
[05:18:05] <lotus> ph88: what's up?
[05:18:27] <lotus> dcope: use jquery's "on" method... I think it binds dynamically?
[05:18:58] <grafi> lotus dcope only if you use it correctly, bind the handler to a parent thats always present on the page
[05:19:03] <ph88> lotus do you know which method i should use to load 100 items with ajax ?
[05:19:09] <lotus> grafi: ahh, yes thank you
[05:19:13] <ph88> there is ajax and initSelection ... i don't get the difference
[05:19:16] <lotus> grafi: <3
[05:19:17] <interop_madness> lotus, race condition? is it possible that two or more $.ajax() requests are sent before the first response arrives and then the .fail()-handler for the wrong request is invoked in case of an error?
[05:19:32] <grafi> dcope $(parentSelector).on('click', '.classForDynamicallyAddedItems', functio() {})
[05:19:38] <lotus> interop_madness: ajax is async, so yes.  make sure you use callbacks correctly
[05:19:45] <dcope> grafi: like $(document).on('click', '.edit-btn' func() { }); ?
[05:19:51] <dcope> grafi: thanks
[05:19:52] <amitprakash> lotus, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ documentation mentions url (default: The current page)
[05:20:05] <grafi> dcope exactly, you might want to choose a closer parent though
[05:20:16] <lotus> amitprakash: ah, then I'm not sure.  I just saw that it looked like a required parameter from the function string definition at the top of the page
[05:20:18] <grafi> dcope but this should work fine regardless
[05:20:35] <interop_madness> lotus, i use $.ajax().done().fail().always(). what do you mean by "correctly"?
[05:20:39] <lotus> amitprakash: at the least, you _could_ use window.location.href -- but only if the default isn't being done nicely
[05:21:09] <amitprakash> lotus, I could but that is redundant as per focs
[05:21:10] <amitprakash> docs*
[05:21:11] <lotus> interop_madness: I'm just guessing.  I didn't see your paste or anything.  I would probably put the second ajax call in the first one's callback to make sure that it doesn't happen.
[05:21:30] <amitprakash> Currently, it posts to the current url/[object Object]
[05:21:53] <dcope> grafi: awesome, that worked
[05:21:54] <lotus> amitprakash: that's quite fun.  Not sure :)
[05:22:02] <ph88> lotus:  can you review me select 2 snippet ?
[05:22:18] <lotus> ph88: sure gist it
[05:22:38] <lotus> amitprakash: what's your code look like?
[05:22:54] <lotus> doug65536: any luck?  :)
[05:23:28] <clime> seutje: ye that works. thank you!
[05:23:46] <doug65536> lotus: almost there
[05:23:58] <grafi> dcope: cool!
[05:23:58] * lotus is excited.
[05:24:06] <clime> seutje: frameElem[0].contentWindow.jQuery('body').data('box-width')     (frameElem is jQuery object in fact)
[05:24:27] <interop_madness> lotus, i have a suspicion (see relevant code snippet here: http://pastie.org/8276993 ): is it possible that defOptions has been overwritten by the second request when it is used by the fail()-handler of the first request?
[05:25:45] <lotus> interop_madness: any reason you used $.extend and not just a normal object?
[05:25:48] <amitprakash> lotus, okay.. so it seems using $.ajax works, but $.post/getJSON etc explicitly assume the first parameter to be a url
[05:25:53] <doug65536> lotus: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/QdVPS/8/
[05:26:02] <amitprakash> overriding how its parent function $.ajax works
[05:27:22] <interop_madness> lotus, the whole thing is done inside the function  getAJAXData: function (options) {
[05:27:22] <interop_madness>  ...}. meaning: allow defaults for some fields of options
[05:28:14] <interop_madness> the user e.g. might call  getAJAXData({url: "foo" }), then the rest of defOptions will be applied, except for url
[05:29:16] <doug65536> lotus: you could get fancy and s.split('\n') then make separate paragraphs for each thing
[05:29:49] <clime> still I would like to avoid setting that attrs but I can't seem to find a way. e.g If I do this in the load event: frameDoc.find('body').width() I get zero. height is ok but width is zero. I think it is because the content somehow derives its width from dialog size. So it probably won't work If i try to set dialog size based on content size xD
[05:30:05] <clime> frameDoc is frameElem.contents()
[05:30:25] <lotus> doug65536: but no way to repeat an expression n times, then?  You'd have to use a loop?
[05:30:47] <seutje> clime: oh, my bad, I have a tendency to prefix jQuery object with a dollar sign
[05:30:51] <doug65536> lotus: at an interview, I would focus on writing clear, readable code, not tricks
[05:30:55] <seutje> like var $this = $(this);
[05:31:18] <clime> seutje: ye it reminds me of php so I try not to do that xD
[05:31:42] <lotus> doug65536: Agreed.  I think my version is very readable and clear.  But I did want to do it on one line if it was sane and possible.  The de-fuzzer was really easy
[05:31:51] <seutje> it beats re-wrapping jQuery objects though
[05:33:25] <doug65536> lotus: if the interviewer has any sense, he will focus on these things: 1) can I read the code? 2) is the code vulnerable to XSS attacks? 3) any redundant DOM lookups? 4) everything has 'var? 5) not polluting global namespace? etc...
[05:34:57] <lotus> doug65536: 3, 4, and 5 could you elaborate?
[05:35:09] <lotus> 3: why needs a var?
[05:35:14] <lotus> erg
[05:35:25] <lotus> 4: redundant dom lookups should be cached in a variable instead?
[05:35:28] <doug65536> don't do selector lookups repeatedly
[05:35:31] <doug65536> yes
[05:36:18] <lotus> 5) make sure function names are prefixed, or are members of an object
[05:37:01] <lotus> Someoen said I should attach my functions to the prototype instead of how I did it in the constructor.  I'll have to do that before I send it off.  I'm not sure if it's just Fuzzer.prototype.method = function() or if I do it inside the constructor somehow.  Any thoughts on that one?
[05:37:06] <doug65536> here's why the interviewer cares: 1) can the other devs work on this guys code? 2) will this guy write vulnerable code? 3) will this guy write slow code? 4&5) will this guys code cause bugs?
[05:37:58] <lotus> doug65536: thank you, sir.
[05:38:01] <ph88> lotus: it seems that the select2 box is opened on page load, how can i make it start closed ?
[05:38:33] <lotus> ph88: that's strange, I've never had it start out expanded before.
[05:38:44] <clime> I would for sure fail no two. Didn't even know you can attack javascript with xss
[05:40:03] <lotus> I know that I have to use nonces in PHP... and encrypt my cookies... :P  but that's about it.
[05:45:51] <spobat> sorry
[05:46:03] <spobat> i somehow just crashed the wlan access point
[05:46:19] <spobat> whatsoever, why isn't the correct width printed here? http://jsfiddle.net/FK8tq/ :/
[05:47:17] <seutje> clime: classic XSS vulnerability is assuming hash parameters are safe
[05:47:29] <seutje> for instance, using them directly to construct markup
[05:47:44] <spobat> ok, first need to addi t ok
[05:47:46] <spobat> add it ok
[05:48:20] <lotus> seutje: smart!
[05:48:31] <clime> seutje: oh I see
[05:48:42] <lotus> seutje: just like $_SERVER['php_self'] in a form variable.
[05:48:56] <seutje> lotus: or any  $_GET
[05:49:19] <lotus> seutje: I love you.  No homo.
[05:49:49] <seutje> for instance, if you were to like $(',img src="' + window.location.hash + '" />'); and someone sent another person a link with like http://example.com/#alert('lolXSS')
[05:50:11] <seutje> that open brakcet went a bit awry, but u get the point
[05:50:54] <lotus> aye.  Cookie theft, or browser exploit, or even simply button clicking could ensue at that point
[05:52:01] <lotus> seutje: say you wanted to use the hash.  How would you do it?
[05:52:04] <le_gars> hello, how can I update a form with the serialized query string values im sending?
[05:52:42] <lotus> ahh, this question is right in line with the whole conversation about XSS xd :)
[05:53:34] <le_gars> Im sending the whole form with ajax and post as method. Im serializing the form and the in the request catch the values and update the dom with eventual input errors?
[05:53:51] <le_gars> Im banging my head against the wall herew
[05:54:18] <lotus> le_gars: any reason you're not pulling out the values first using .val() and then passing them along as distinct data params?
[05:54:37] <le_gars> lotus: ignorance?
[05:54:41] <le_gars> :)
[05:54:56] <lotus> le_gars: well I mean if you have a dynamic number of form parameters, that could be a reason
[05:55:20] <lotus> maybe.  Not sure if you can pass an array or an object to a .post data param
[05:55:29] <lotus> well, besides the object that the data param _is_...
[05:56:52] <le_gars> well I the number of form parameters is not dynamic in that sense, I have a 3 input fields, name email and such and one hidden field with a stored value
[05:57:13] <seutje> lotus: I did? o.O
[05:58:29] <le_gars> these Im sending to the server with an ajax call. So I serialize the form values and do a post with them. What I have noticed is that if there any errors in the inputs I cant update the form witht them.
[05:58:40] <lotus> var email_value = $('input[name="email"]').val();  $.post({url:http://www.asdf.com,{email: email_value}}); or somesuch
[05:58:44] <lotus> le_gars: ^
[05:58:50] <lotus> seutje: I mean say you wanted to use the hash safely
[05:59:01] <lotus> seutje: would you have to use string functions to parse it?
[05:59:09] <le_gars> hm ok
[05:59:09] <seutje> lotus: make sure it's patterns are what you expect
[05:59:12] <seutje> its*
[05:59:13] <le_gars> Ill try that
[05:59:25] <lotus> seutje: ahh, so alpha-numeric or what-have-you
[05:59:27] <seutje> lotus: like, don't use it directly, but parse it first
[05:59:30] <lotus> no parens, no curly braces
[05:59:38] <lotus> no quotes...
[05:59:43] <lotus> angle brackets...
[06:00:18] <seutje> like if you're expecting an image path, check if it can be considered a valid url
[06:00:29] <seutje> jQuery does some guarding against this
[06:00:55] <seutje> if your selector doesn't start with '<', yet still contains something that looks like html, it'll throw an error
[06:00:55] <pi3r> Hi guys
[06:01:28] <pi3r> I have a question about JqueryUI#autocomplete. Is it possible to have the source target in the select callback?
[06:01:36] <lotus> seutje: thank you :)
[06:01:54] <pi3r> like the current input being autocompleted
[06:03:26] <pi3r> ok it's "this"... dumb me... sorry guys :D
[06:03:49] <interop_madness> i've got a $.ajax() request with dataType=json for which the server returns some json wherein some value equals to "??". a subsequent request fails with cryptic errors (specifically, the error is raised in line 8567 of jquery.js v1.10.2). said subsequent request, when called isolated, works fine...
[06:04:30] <interop_madness> ...the whole thing seems to have to do with http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12326. i tried setting Content-Type:application/json and Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8, to no avail
[06:05:12] <interop_madness> since the data is json and the json serialization is done by.NET JavaScriptSerializer, i am out of ideas where the bug is, if it isn't inside the jquery library
[06:05:55] <interop_madness> i have verified that the "??" value triggers the later error. remove it, and everything works fine
[06:06:03] <lotus> happy hacking, all.  Peace out.
[06:06:41] <interop_madness> the actual error raised is: jQuery.error( callbackName + " was not called" );
[06:08:20] <rjcousineau> Hi, i'm trying to scroll a page to the bottom and then jump to the top and repeat.  here is working example: http://jsfiddle.net/DxUFw/ -- Problem is there is a delay at the end..  i don't understand why?  Also, if you look at console there are 2 log messages, instead of one.  any idea why?
[06:14:40] <interop_madness> what did it for me was setting jsonp:false for the ajax request...
[06:17:56] <icedburg> hey guys, new here. I have a technical (custom) wysiwyg text editor question
[06:21:18] <juboba> Hey, how can I prevent the effect to occur if I quickly hover in and out? I would like to use .animate() http://jsfiddle.net/NKC2j/4/
[06:22:25] <Cryp71c_> juboba, there's probably a way to cancel a jquery animation.
[06:22:39] <Cryp71c_> juboba, http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[06:22:55] <Cryp71c_> You can't "prevent" it, but you can stop the animation on mouseout.
[06:23:10] <Cryp71c_> IF there is no running animation, blindly calling .stop() shouldn't cause any problems afaik.
[06:23:20] <slax0r> juboba, use hoverIntent plugin
[06:23:29] <slax0r> it enables a delayed mousein/mouseout
[06:24:44] <dcope> hey all, i have another question. is it possible to call a function that that is an event handler but somehow pass it a refernce to an object so $(this) works?
[06:25:22] <NoiseEee> dcope: code example / jsfiddle
[06:25:39] <dcope> wat
[06:26:16] <dcope> what do you need a test case for?
[06:26:26] <dcope> i have function foo() { ... } that gets called when a link is clicked from .on();... i'm wondering if i can call foo manually and pass it a link so $(this) will be valid inside of foo()
[06:26:48] <NoiseEee> it would never be 'this'
[06:27:05] <NoiseEee> you could pass the element, or you can look into .proxy() depending on your situation, which is why i asked about a code sample
[06:28:32] <NoiseEee> dcope: offhand, it would probably make more sense to pass ev.target from your .on() call, so that your foo() function can accept any element
[06:28:39] <NoiseEee> (and therefore your manual call would work)
[06:29:37] <dcope> i see
[06:29:40] <dcope> that will work -- thanks
[06:29:50] <NoiseEee> np
[06:31:25] <pranavrc> Hi. I'm not able to read a remote xml file in an ajax function. Local files work. Is this because of the Same Origin Policy or something? Is there a fix?
[06:32:36] <NoiseEee> pranavrc: offhand, yes, that's SOP in action... your fix would be getting your backend to get the xml file, and return it
[06:33:17] <pranavrc> NoiseEee, alright, thanks
[06:37:40] <vanquish349> hey, very new to javascript. if i wanted to create about 10 or so links which scroll down the page like http://pastebin.com/Mp8iwKHP how should it be done? should i just copy and paste it several times and change the data to make it work, or is there a better way to do it which is a lot smaller?
[06:38:22] <Ericx2x> i'm beginning to hate myself
[06:38:48] <Ericx2x> i have just realized i've contributed as being one of the people who says "i'm new to javascript can you please do my work for me"
[06:38:57] <Ericx2x> with learning hardly anything
[06:39:05] <Ericx2x> time to change my ways
[06:39:21] <Ericx2x> i think i'm going to become a chinese farmer budist
[06:39:27] <Ericx2x> monk
[06:40:33] <ddssc> when doing $.post , what is the datatype for default POST body , like param1=value1&param2=value2 ?
[06:40:41] <ddssc> text ?
[06:43:48] <vanquish349> Silent Channel GO!!!
[06:46:22] <pranavrc> NoiseEee, is there a workaround to do this from within js/jquery itself? Fetching the xml file and using its contents? Or can it only be done from the backend?
[06:47:03] <doug65536> ddssc: do you mean multipart/form-data?
[06:47:16] <NoiseEee> pranavrc: nope, its still on another machine right?  even if it was on the client machine, the user would need to select if first via <input type='file'> before JS/jquery could read it.
[06:47:33] <doug65536> ddssc: or application/x-www-form-urlencoded
[06:48:00] <pranavrc> NoiseEee, ah shoot
[06:48:56] <doug65536> ddssc: file upload forms would need to be multipart/form-data but simple url encoded form posts would be application/x-www-form-urlencoded
[06:50:42] <ddssc> doug65536: thanks
[06:52:10] <doug65536> vanquish349: don't copy/paste code. period. you can do $(document).on('click', 'a[target]', function(ev) { ... here, $(ev.target) is what they clicked ... });
[06:52:39] <vanquish349> doug65536: yes i know you should never do it, i was just trying to explain my situation
[06:52:56] <vanquish349> learn't that from coding c and python
[06:53:05] <doug65536> vanquish349: ok good :)
[06:53:54] <doug65536> vanquish349: you don't have to attach the event all the way up at document - just as long as it's something that is the parent of all of those links, one handler can handle them all
[06:54:46] <vanquish349> doug65536: with this, if i were to create a sperate link that links to an external place, would it cause issue or?
[06:54:48] <doug65536> vanquish349: it works because events "bubble" up to each parent until the document
[06:56:05] <doug65536> vanquish349: yes it would. you need to make it identifiable... by binding the handler on a parent where you know all the childrens a[target] will need to be handled, or by adding a class name with some meaning and replacing the a[target] with .someClassName
[06:56:44] <Bloomberg> Good morning guys!!
[06:56:45] <vanquish349> doug65536: i think i need to go read up on classes, haven't used them before
[06:57:00] <doug65536> vanquish349: not classes like C++ classes. classes like CSS
[06:57:10] <vanquish349> ohhh
[06:57:29] <Bloomberg> Someone has worked with Jtablet Jquery plugin?
[06:58:23] <nicholas-c> Hey folks. Just a quick one. How would I go about fetching the original CSS value for a div?
[06:58:29] <doug65536> vanquish349: <a class="something somethingElse etc">XX</a>   <-- has 3 classes
[06:58:40] <vanquish349> doug65536: ok
[06:58:53] <doug65536> vanquish349: you can give a purpose to something with a class, as well as styling it
[06:58:55] <Cork> nicholas-c: "original"?
[06:59:15] <Cork> nicholas-c: there is no original css
[06:59:23] <nicholas-c> Cork: At the moment I have a div that animates to a new left: position when you .hover
[06:59:39] <Cork> nicholas-c: you can remove inline css and get what something else is setting on it, but that is it
[06:59:42] <nicholas-c> on mouseexit I want it to return to the position before animate took place
[06:59:44] <doug65536> nicholas-c: .css({left:''})
[07:01:06] <vanquish349> doug65536: so if i had a class to all the links which i require the function on, do i just set the selector to be what exactly?
[07:01:25] <doug65536> vanquish349: .theClassName
[07:01:29] <vanquish349> ok
[07:01:31] <nicholas-c> doug65536: That returns it to the far left but not to where the CSS said originally
[07:02:53] <Cork> nicholas-c: that means you have the original position inline
[07:03:00] <Cork> nicholas-c: and then the dom don't have the info
[07:03:08] <Cork> nicholas-c: you need to store it before you change it
[07:03:12] <vanquish349> doug65536: so would it be like   $(document).on('click', .hlink, function(ev) {
[07:03:20] <vanquish349> or more like $(document).on('click').hlink, function(ev) {
[07:04:47] <NoiseEee> vanquish349: $(document).on('click','.hlink',function() {})
[07:04:53] <vanquish349> ok
[07:05:11] <NoiseEee> vanquish349: but if .hlink is always a certain element,  like an a,  a.hlink would be more performant
[07:05:26] <NoiseEee> and certainly if you don't truly need it on document, use a better parent
[07:05:27] <vanquish349> ok
[07:06:40] <nicholas-c> Cork: Thanks, now I have stored the original position it's all good. Thanks man (You too doug65536 <3)
[07:06:50] <doug65536> nicholas-c: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/GPgun/ :D
[07:09:06] <doug65536> nicholas-c: best way to model it in your mind is, if there is a style= on the element, it overrides the css. setting the css to '' on the element removes that override and lets the css "flow into" the element

[07:15:39] <seutje> tbh, idc, this might as well be #javascript, just less useless
[07:16:17] <doug65536> vanquish349: are you sure the anchors have class="Hlink"
[07:16:36] <doug65536> vanquish349: or at least Hlink in there
[07:16:40] <vanquish349> doug65536: yes,
[07:17:00] <doug65536> vanquish349: is there enough content for it to be able to scroll that far?
[07:17:12] <doug65536> vanquish349: it won't force it past the bottom
[07:17:24] <vanquish349> yes, i added extra content exacctly for that reason

[07:23:37] <doug65536> Bloomberg: looks ok
[07:23:47] <doug65536> Bloomberg: what's wrong? did you check browser console?
[07:24:08] <Bloomberg> Yes, always show me the same result
[07:24:17] <vanquish349> doug65536: the problem now is the location at which it is going to, before i would just <h1 id="location">
[07:24:32] <vanquish349> though it doesn't try and go to that location
[07:24:34] <Bloomberg> I have like ten options for filtering, and always show me the same result
[07:24:46] <clime> is it possible to hide jquery dialog when there is redirection going on in its iframe and show it just after the content has been loaded? Is there something like beforeLoad?:)
[07:24:57] <doug65536> remove 'a' from filter and just put '.Hlink'
[07:25:12] <doug65536> vanquish349: ^
[07:25:18] <vanquish349> ok
[07:26:02] <doug65536> vanquish349: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/Prdw4/3/
[07:26:55] <vanquish349> doug65536: i still can't get it to scroll to the correct place, i am sorry i am so stupid by the way
[07:26:57] <petey> has anyone had any experience with http://responsiveslides.com ?
[07:27:00] <petey> Is this where I would ask that question?
[07:27:17] <doug65536> vanquish349:  you aren't stupid
[07:27:28] <rogeruiz> petey: what's your question about?
[07:27:44] <doug65536> vanquish349: it scrolls, but not to the correct place?
[07:27:45] <lotus> hey, is it possible to accomplish this task more elegantly?  https://gist.github.com/ShadesOfLight/6365820  I was given this task for a programming interview tryout: chili.fuzzproductions.com/quizzes/js1  the question was embedded in the <span hidden> tags, and it reads: Elegantly unscramble this message with jQuery using the space provided.  Then write the scrambler that made it.  The answer is an object with global scope that can scramble and un
[07:27:48] <petey> I can't seem to get the navigation to work rogeruiz
[07:28:19] <lotus> doug65536: don't answer!  xD
[07:28:22] <petey> I'm looking at the defaults and usability, I have the thumbnails working, the photos fade, but the arrows don't show up and all I see is Previous/Next at the bottom
[07:28:28] <lotus> doug65536: I'm trying to get multiple people's feedback.
[07:28:34] <doug65536> lotus: sure
[07:28:37] <clime> I guess ill do it just by binding to each <a href> on click in the iframe and to each form on submit.
[07:29:12] <vanquish349> doug65536: it trys to scroll straight up, if i try a link which doesn't have a ID tag it does the same thing, so i think it can't recognise the way i am defining the target or something.
[07:30:01] <AlVal> Hi , trying to call an api which returns some simple json using getJSON , and display it as a simple html table. can anyone show me what I've got wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/zyUGj/
[07:30:14] <doug65536> vanquish349: ah, I think I know what's going on
[07:30:26] <doug65536> vanquish349: do you have Hlink on a parent of things?
[07:30:41] <AlVal> idiot explanation would be really appreciated, I'm very much a beginner
[07:30:46] <vanquish349> doug65536: no?
[07:31:07] <NoiseEee> AlVal: you don't get to make an ajax/xhr call to alval.serveftp.com:82 unless your script is running on alval.serveftp.com:82
[07:31:10] <rynkan> I got a bunch of image-layers on top of each other, they form a room togheter by some layers being transparent where others are not. can i somehow get which layer was clicked?
[07:31:19] <doug65536> vanquish349: do you have it on a website I can debug?
[07:31:33] <vanquish349> hmm
[07:31:39] <petey> rogeruiz: http://jsfiddle.net/totalmajor/SHKR8/
[07:31:41] <vanquish349> doug65536: give me a minute
[07:31:43] <doug65536> vanquish349: /msg doug65536 and I'll debug the real site
[07:31:50] <doug65536> vanquish349: if you want
[07:31:52] <petey> I can't get it to load right now but give me a sec
[07:32:00] <AlVal> NoiseEee: I can call that url in a browser and get the json from any location
[07:32:02] <NoiseEee> rynkan: $(someParentOfTheImageLayers).on('click',function(e) { var clickedElement = $(e.target); });
[07:32:03] <vanquish349> doug65536: yeah, that sounds good
[07:32:06] <rynkan> like making an image only "clickable" where the image is not transparent?
[07:32:14] <NoiseEee> AlVal: yep, but you don't get to do it from JS
[07:32:28] <AlVal> NoiseEee: ah, thanks - can I manually give it the json somehow?
[07:32:31] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript @ AlVal
[07:32:42] <AlVal> NoiseEee like paste the json in?
[07:32:44] <NoiseEee> AlVal: you can have your backend/server retrieve it from that location, and send it back to your JS
[07:32:53] <rynkan> NoiseEee: yeah
[07:32:56] <NoiseEee> AlVal: i guess if that JSON will never ever change?
[07:33:12] <AlVal> Noisee: I just want to prove that my script works
[07:33:22] <AlVal> ill be running it from an allowed location eventually obviously
[07:33:32] <NoiseEee> AlVal: 'an allowed location' = what?
[07:33:46] <AlVal> from a server without the restriction that jsfiddle has
[07:33:57] <NoiseEee> AlVal: its not a JSfiddle restriction, its https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[07:34:26] <rynkan> I just cant figure out how I can "click trough" one layer not not another. or am i going at this the wrong way?
[07:34:45] <doug65536> AlVal: it's a restriction enforced by browsers to prevent abuse of ajax
[07:34:57] <NoiseEee> rynkan: yeah you can't "click through" something; if the image is transparent, even though you can *see* what's below it, you're still clicking the one on top
[07:35:00] <AlVal> NoiseEee: arent remote apis regularly called like this?
[07:35:20] <NoiseEee> AlVal: either they are set up to use CORS, or the backend gets it (like I explained)
[07:35:57] <rynkan> NoiseEee: mm. i figured that was the case. any way i can make this work some how?
[07:36:08] <Bloomberg> doug65536: man you has worked with this plugin before?
[07:36:11] <doug65536> AlVal: if the page doing the ajax is the same domain as the server responding to the ajax, yes it works
[07:36:18] <doug65536> Bloomberg: no
[07:36:35] <NoiseEee> rynkan: not offhand :|
[07:37:09] <Bloomberg> Oh, is that I want to know if the filtering must to have another function to DB
[07:37:53] <rynkan> im so fracked
[07:38:04] <AlVal> NoiseEee: how does this work then http://jsfiddle.net/pU86z/
[07:38:24] <NoiseEee> AlVal: jsonp and/or CORS
[07:38:38] <NoiseEee> AlVal: but its up to the people who created the API to allow/implement such a thing
[07:38:58] <NoiseEee> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP @ AlVal
[07:39:12] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/HTTP/Access_control_CORS @ AlVal
[07:40:27] <AlVal> NoiseEee: thanks - is there a way to tell if my api supports it, or did you somehow notice that it doesn't?
[07:41:55] <NoiseEee> AlVal: less about the API, more about the server its running on, and I presume something like serveftp.com doesn't allow such a thing
[07:42:08] <AlVal> NoiseEee: the server's mine
[07:42:26] <NoiseEee> so you can look into how to implement CORS/jsonp to make it work, if you like
[07:42:33] <NoiseEee> AlVal: but understand it puts your server at a bit of a risk
[07:42:38] <AlVal> anyway, I'll get past that hurdle later - I can run the script from the same server
[07:42:48] <AlVal> more importantly, the bit thats harder for me, is getting a working script!
[07:42:53] <NoiseEee> AlVal: the safer alternative is to have your backend run to get it.  and if you're doing that ^^ then the ports must match as well
[07:43:34] <AlVal> so can I just paste some json into my jsfiddle and have getJSON pick it up locally?
[07:43:43] <AlVal> rather than actually calling my url
[07:43:56] <AlVal> so I can validate the rest of the script's workings
[07:44:29] <NoiseEee> sure, just do data=<yourJson> afaik
[07:44:29] <clime> iframes are trciky
[07:45:33] <NoiseEee> AlVal: straight up i'll tell you your current code will not do what you want. you need to use a callback;  "data" is not available to you when its run (nor is it even defined).  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/ look at the examples.
[07:46:34] <AlVal> NoiseEee: I started out with the flickr example on that page
[07:47:19] <NoiseEee> AlVal: review the example then :)
[07:47:47] <NoiseEee> note the .done() handler
[07:48:02] <AlVal> then , because that example is specific to images, tried to merge in this advice http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1051061/convert-json-array-to-an-html-table-in-jquery which was more specific to processing json text into html lists
[07:48:37] <NoiseEee> AlVal: all i can say is look harder, and good luck. you have no callback defined.
[07:49:45] <doug65536> Bloomberg: where did you get the server side code for that? from tutorial or your own
[07:50:21] <Bloomberg> I adapt the script from the web
[07:51:26] <Bloomberg> really is very weird because always I select a diferent option and show me all the records
[07:51:32] <doug65536> Bloomberg: did you try getting the data in your browser by putting the ajax url in address bar?
[07:52:09] <doug65536> Bloomberg: problem is probably with server side code if I had to guess
[07:52:37] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/iTEsiK/1/edit
[07:52:50] <Bloomberg> this is all the script that does the filtering process
[07:53:35] <doug65536> Bloomberg: did you put a breakpoint in there and make sure it calls that click handler?
[07:53:51] <Bloomberg> yes.
[07:53:51] <AlVal> NoiseEee : will paypal $20 for a solution :D
[07:54:09] <Bloomberg> And the options show me the option filter ok
[07:55:23] <doug65536> Bloomberg: someone should tell this jtable guy that we don't have 640x480 monitors anymore
[07:55:51] <BillCriswell> AlVal: You can do it pretty easily with a loop and a '<td>' + filtered_fields.join('</td><td>') + '</td>'
[07:56:12] <doug65536> Bloomberg: I hate the stupid scrolling areas in his page
[07:56:23] <Bloomberg> I believe all the problem is here   ::::    $('#content-files-table').jtable('load',{ 				typeContact: infoData.value 			})
[07:56:34] <doug65536> Bloomberg: so do I
[07:57:11] <Bloomberg> doug65536: me too
[07:57:11] <doug65536> if I didn't have to peek though this goofy little scrolling area in this stupid page I would know already if that is the problem
[07:57:11] <Bloomberg> jaja
[07:57:12] <rogeruiz> petey: I'm taking a look at your fiddle now
[07:57:23] <petey> ok
[07:57:49] <rogeruiz> petey: http://jsfiddle.net/SHKR8/4/ I have the slider working, but the styles are all jumbled
[07:58:08] <petey> Okay cool, give me a sec
[07:58:17] <rogeruiz> the reason it was failing originally was the ID that you were calling it on was not the one in you HTML
[07:58:21] <AlVal> BillCriswell: $20's yours then if you can do it so easily :D
[07:58:31] <doug65536> Bloomberg: where does "typeContact" come from
[07:58:39] <doug65536> I don't see that parameter anywhere
[07:59:00] <AlVal> I probably should have come in here pretending it was some type of contest to get the most efficient shortest solution to the problem, and I'd have got 10 workin answers by now haha
[07:59:30] <petey> rogeruiz - I'm going to update with my styles but I have to step away from the computer for a few minutes
[07:59:34] <BillCriswell> AlVal: Why are you focused on shortest?
[07:59:50] <Bloomberg> for example "Hoteles"
[08:00:06] <NoiseEee> AlVal: really, read the documentation, look at the examples you yourself pasted and note the differences.
[08:00:12] <Bloomberg> So, I need that show me all records with that typecontact
[08:00:19] <fish9370> hello!
[08:00:32] <doug65536> Bloomberg: so that isn't in the example?
[08:00:54] <doug65536> Bloomberg: how am I supposed to find the problem without seeing the server side code
[08:01:23] <Bloomberg> What do you believe that is the problem?
[08:01:34] <AlVal> NoiseEee: I found one big difference all right, theirs works. in the text example I merged in, I thought the "data" was required, was something to do with the difference between doing it for images and text
[08:01:40] <doug65536> I believe that you aren't getting the parameter in your code
[08:02:00] <AlVal> BillCriswell: I'm not.. was just saying I probably could have coerced full working solutions out of you guys using that kind of approach!
[08:02:00] <Bloomberg> how is that ?
[08:02:11] <doug65536> Bloomberg: but I have no idea whatsoever, I don't even know what language you are using on server
[08:02:25] <Bloomberg> PHP
[08:02:51] <doug65536> Bloomberg: ok, well don't show me some entirely 100% different code and ask me if I see the problem. his site has ASP
[08:03:03] <fish9370> sombody help me
[08:03:10] <doug65536> are you reading $_GET['typeContact'] in there somewhere?
[08:03:20] <NoiseEee> AlVal: again, a big hint is "callbacks" (look at the .done on the examples compared to yours)
[08:03:24] <AlVal> NoiseEee: it's not that I'm averse to reading the documentation, it's that the documentation assumes an existing level of competence that can take a lot of time to reach, and for someone who may never touch jquery again, is it worth me investing that much time?
[08:03:33] <NoiseEee> AlVal: unfortunately this is a 'we help you' channel, not a 'we do it for you' channel
[08:03:47] <Bloomberg> no
[08:03:51] <NoiseEee> anyhow good luck AlVal :)
[08:03:53] <AlVal> NoiseEee: but you've spoonfed me enough to pique my interest again
[08:04:03] <AlVal> so I'm gonna go back and work with the pointers youve given me
[08:04:25] <Bloomberg> This is the value bringing  :::   $('.left-menu-a').click(function(e){ 		var infoData = {value: $(this).data('info')};
[08:04:56] <doug65536> Bloomberg: that code does literally nothing
[08:05:31] <fish9370> i need write plugin with no DOM connection. how? i need link
[08:05:34] <Bloomberg> Yes , becasuse when I add the alert(infoData.value); show me the option needed
[08:05:40] <Bloomberg> because*
[08:05:42] <doug65536> Bloomberg: it wraps a jquery wrapper around the thing you clicked, reads the data-info attribute, stores it in infoData, then, the function returns, and it throws it away
[08:06:29] <doug65536> Bloomberg: anyway, unless you want to show me your php, it's a waste of time ...
[08:06:48] <grafi> wrappering the wrapperer into wrappering wrapperers
[08:06:57] <doug65536> I have a car here. can you tell me how to remove the cylinder head? I can't tell you what manufacturer the car is though
[08:07:33] <pranavrc> how do I select tags that contain a specific child tag using find()?
[08:08:26] <tw2113> $('#container').find('tag');
[08:08:46] <doug65536> pranavrc: $('...selector for those children...').each(function() { $(this).closest('...selector for the parent...') ... }) ?
[08:08:48] <tw2113> or are you trying to select the parent instead of the kids?
[08:09:18] <pranavrc> trying to select the parents
[08:10:45] <doug65536> pranavrc: my code finds all the potential children, then searched its parents for the closest parent that matches the other selector. this will do as you describe
[08:11:19] <pranavrc> doug65536, implementing that, thanks!
[08:13:05] <doug65536> Bloomberg: what are you reading from $_GET ?
[08:13:26] <Bloomberg> can we speak inside?
[08:13:34] <doug65536> Bloomberg: oh didn't notice
[08:14:14] <BillCriswell> AlVal: I got distracted. Are you trying to do this? http://jsbin.com/iCOQA/1/
[08:15:41] <AlVal> BillCriswell: yes! assuming that output that was formed based on json input
[08:16:44] <BillCriswell> rows can be a json object as well. Damn near the same thing.
[08:16:51] <BillCriswell> In this case, at least.
[08:17:50] <fish9370> thanks
[08:18:21] <BillCriswell> I'm a dumb ass. I was just going crazy with .apply and .call when pick took an array.
[08:18:56] <BillCriswell> AlVal: http://jsbin.com/iCOQA/2/ there you go, updated.
[08:19:44] <BillCriswell> I wish underscore was included in jQuery. Love that shit.
[08:22:57] <AlVal> BillCriswell: looks like that will work with my json, have stuck some of my json in there - see http://jsbin.com/iCOQA/3/
[08:23:23] <BillCriswell> Sweet.
[08:24:11] <AlVal> BillCriswell: but if I look at the json output from my api, it has some other stuff wrapped around the json
[08:24:18] <AlVal> see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18375362/simplest-way-to-grab-data-using-jquery-getjson-from-this-api-and-present-it-in-a
[08:24:42] <AlVal> i.e. at the beginning an extra {     "data":
[08:24:55] <AlVal> and at the end an extra ,      "message": "",      "result": "success" }
[08:25:01] <AlVal> do I need to worry about these wrappers?
[08:25:44] <BillCriswell> Yes. It changes the structure of the data. It should not return this sometimes. You'd want to do _.each( response.data, function(show){}); etc.
[08:26:33] <BillCriswell> AlVal: http://jsbin.com/iCOQA/2/
[08:26:56] <BillCriswell> Er, more clear with the variable names: http://jsbin.com/iCOQA/4/
[08:28:57] <AlVal> BillCriswell: and I assume I can replace the pasted json with a getJSON(url) (I'll run the api serving the json on same server, port etc)
[08:29:09] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:29:53] <BillCriswell> So you'd do like $.getJSON(url, function(result){ /* Code I provided */ });
[08:30:21] <AlVal> BillCriswell: pm me your paypal email - I owe you $20
[08:31:39] <boytoy> AlVal: how about you add a few zeros to that :P
[08:32:01] <BillCriswell> AlVal: I don't have a paypal account, so it's all good.
[08:32:22] <BillCriswell> I appreciate the offer though.
[08:32:58] <AlVal> hmm I'd send bitcoins, but I tried to buy them once, and it was a complete pain in the ass, being in the uk , I gave up in the end
[08:33:24] <AlVal> boytoy: sure, but I'd expect extras
[08:33:30] <AlVal> jeez that sounded seedy
[08:33:31] <BillCriswell> AlVal: It's no trouble at all. jQuery and underscore did the pain in the ass parts.
[08:35:08] <AlVal> yeah I see some underscore script referenced, will read up on it
[08:35:30] <BillCriswell> AlVal: It's very useful.
[08:36:01] <lemonsparrow> for (i=0,j=1,k=2;i<10,j<20,k<30;i++,j+=2,k+=3) {}
[08:36:10] <lemonsparrow> How many loops does the above sample code perform?
[08:37:59] <tw2113> i'd cheat and add my own separate counter and check its value at the end
[08:38:52] <BillCriswell> Would it just be 10?
[08:38:57] <BillCriswell> Being pretty lazy there.
[08:39:21] <BillCriswell> Yeah, 10, duh.
[08:39:33] <BillCriswell> What's the point of the question?
[08:41:09] <_br_> Silly question. I want a piece of text to fadeout, change and then fadein again. But $('#ele').fadeOut().text( "New text" ).fadeIn() looks weird. What am I doing wrong?
[08:42:41] <BillCriswell> _br_: You want to use the callbacks here.
[08:43:11] <_br_> BillCriswell: Hm, I see, didn't know, thanks.
[08:43:37] <BillCriswell> $('#ele').fadeOut(function(){ $(this).text( "New text" ).fadeIn(); }) I think would make it more smooth for you.
[08:45:09] <talntid> those look the same to me
[08:45:45] <_br_> BillCriswell: nice, trying that, thank you
[08:47:02] <BillCriswell> talntid: The first one won't wait for the fadeOut to complete.
[08:48:56] <_br_> BillCriswell: Works perfectly and is exactly what I was looking for, thanks.
[08:49:05] <BillCriswell> _br_: Sweeeeeet.
[08:49:15] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[08:51:30] <CthdrlCo_> status: pulling my friggin hair out. can anyone look to see why I'm getting a Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded? http://jsfiddle.net/ywGSR/
[08:51:43] <CthdrlCo_> it was working fine up to yesterday
[08:52:11] <CthdrlCo_> sometimes I get that error...most of the time it crashes the browser...and the kicker is that it's not doing anything crazy
[08:53:46] <talntid> Did you debug this in browser and see the info? Chrome -> open web inspector -> Sources tab -> Click on bottom button 'pause on exceptions' and see the reason?
[08:54:08] <dcherman> CthdrlCo_: you are binding an event handler for `submit`, and then calling `submit` in your event handler.  what's wrong with that picture :)
[08:55:27] <CthdrlCo_> dcherman: .........................Gah! the rest of my hair thanks you

[08:56:11] <lukissimo81> i am a beginner!!
[08:56:31] <lukissimo81> is possible an help?
[08:57:18] <NoiseEee> lukissimo81: i'd guess the first step would be asking an actual question

[09:01:18] <lukissimo81> the script is supersize
[09:01:22] <talntid> sorta creepy....
[09:03:28] <darkfrog> in jQuery UI Dialog I'm setting zIndex to 5000 and it still appearing underneath things with a lower z-index.  Is there something I'm missing or is the functionality broken?
[09:04:14] <Whirl3d> Is there any way using jquery UI to do accordians within accordians?
[09:04:38] <rogeruiz> no problem petey. any clues to what it was?
[09:04:50] <Whirl3d> Or can anyone recommend an outline plugin with collapsible elements?
[09:05:07] <petey> rogeruiz, so when I was first trying to figure out the slider, I would manually put in the nav controls, etc.
[09:05:27] <lukissimo81> unfortunately know little about programming
[09:05:30] <petey> It turns out it was as easy as removing the default stylesheet, setting my own controls and styling the elements that were generated, if that makes sense
[09:08:01] <lukissimo81> for my question? no answer?
[09:08:43] <HypnotiX> hello, can someone explain why this works http://jsfiddle.net/dU2cf/148/ and this doesnt ? http://jsfiddle.net/dU2cf/149/
[09:09:38] <alexr2> I'm having an issue with ajax https requests.  I'm on an https site, making a request to the same site, and I'm getting a notification saying that it's insecure content.  Any tips?
[09:12:14] <Cork> HypnotiX: wfm
[09:12:29] <HypnotiX> sorry what? :)
[09:12:36] <Cork> Works For Me
[09:12:54] <HypnotiX> but they are different
[09:13:13] <Cork> sure the second one has different delays for each li
[09:13:23] <HypnotiX> the effect in the first one is the one i want, but i dont understand why i have to use i*200 for the delay
[09:13:27] <Cork> while the first one waits 200 ms then shows all
[09:13:56] <HypnotiX> how does the value of i change on each loop, it increases by one ?
[09:13:58] <Cork> HypnotiX: $('li').each(function() { $(this).delay(200) is the same as $('li').delay(200)
[09:14:16] <Cork> HypnotiX: yes, it is the index in the array
[09:14:27] <Cork> so first it is 0 * 200
[09:14:31] <Cork> then 1 * 200 and so on
[09:15:09] <HypnotiX> i dont understand why is the the index
[09:15:17] <HypnotiX> it*

[09:15:35] <HypnotiX> ah ok thanx :)
[09:15:43] <juboba> Hey, how can I prevent the effect to occur if I quickly hover in and out? I would like to use .animate() http://jsfiddle.net/NKC2j/4/
[09:16:07] <Cork> juboba: you would have to use timers to delay the animation a little
[09:16:07] <rogeruiz> petey: yup, makes sense to me. it's always best to see what the plugin generates
[09:16:19] <Cork> and cancel the animation on out
[09:16:34] <juboba> uhmm
[09:16:42] <Cork> juboba: there are plugins for this

[09:21:56] <maxmoore14> can someone help me with jquery mobile page caching? http://jsbin.com/IkIZUyI/1/edit?js
[09:22:10] <anew> is there any way to use append() without having it automatically generate closing tags ?
[09:22:33] <maxmoore14> I'm currently using kind of a stupid hack to force each page to re-init every time
[09:22:44] <NoiseEee> anew: whats the problem/issue?
[09:22:45] <maxmoore14> obviously that is pretty slow
[09:22:57] <NoiseEee> anew: perhaps you are seeing to append to something else, then append *that* ?
[09:23:11] <Cork> anew: what are you trying to do?
[09:23:22] <Cork> anew: why would you want to generate invalid html?
[09:23:33] <anew> i mean i just need to $('..').append('<form....>');
[09:23:40] <anew> but it ends up with </form> every time
[09:23:40] <maxmoore14> not sure how I can force it to reload dynamic data that I load during pageinit without removing the page from the cache
[09:23:47] <anew> cork because i'm closing it later in the dom
[09:23:55] <anew> i dont want to close it at the exact moment i'm using append
[09:23:57] <maxmoore14> or not cache - dom I should say
[09:24:03] <Cork> anew: you would have to wrapAll the elements you want inside
[09:24:09] <Cork> anew: dom sin't html
[09:24:16] <Cork> anew: dom is built from html
[09:24:20] <Cork> you don't have tags there
[09:24:29] <anew> whatever the semantics are - i'm using </form> later
[09:24:30] <NoiseEee> anew: then create your elements, then append them to the form, then append the form.
[09:24:35] <anew> and dont want to use it in that exact moment
[09:24:37] <Cork> anew: you can't
[09:24:52] <NoiseEee> anew: you're missing the issue / re-read what i just typed.
[09:25:07] <Cork> anew: $(elements that should be inside).wrappAll('<form/>')
[09:25:15] <anew> i cant do what u say nnoiseee
[09:25:18] <anew> otherwise i would do that
[09:25:33] <Cork> anew: then you can't create dom
[09:25:40] <anew> i need it to come later specifically
[09:25:42] <NoiseEee> anew: then insert into the form you created
[09:25:45] <Cork> anew: you would have to create html, and when you are done parse it
[09:25:47] <anew> there must be somewhere to not create </form> every time
[09:25:55] <NoiseEee> anew: no. you're just not grasping the concept.
[09:25:56] <Cork> anew: you don't you create a dom node
[09:26:01] <Cork> it's not the same thing
[09:26:13] <Whirl3d> After searching the googlesphere for hours, I am unable to find a simple jquery plugin that allows both nestable and collapsible contents. Any suggestions?
[09:26:27] <Cork> anew: dom is a tree structure, and they have parents and children
[09:26:29] <anew> so could u explain the concept then please
[09:26:36] <anew> yes
[09:26:37] <Cork> anew: no tags, no opening and closing, just references
[09:26:51] <NoiseEee> anew: both cork and i have, several times.  what is your specific issue / what are  you trying to do?
[09:27:05] <Cork> anew: if you want to handle it as html, create a string
[09:27:14] <Cork> then you can use tags
[09:27:22] <anew> create a string then append(string); ?
[09:27:27] <Cork> yes
[09:27:37] <anew> ok let me try that thx
[09:27:38] <Cork> var newHTML = '';
[09:27:46] <Cork> newHTML += '<form>'
[09:27:51] <Cork> newHTML += 'other content'
[09:27:57] <Cork> newHTML += '</form>'
[09:28:08] <Cork> $(parent).append(newHTML)
[09:28:29] <anew> but leave out newHTML += '</form>' this line tho right
[09:28:32] <anew> for me specifically
[09:28:34] <anew> let me try this thx
[09:28:36] <Cork> anew: no
[09:28:39] <anew> wut
[09:28:44] <Cork> when you get to append, you need to have valid html
[09:28:50] <NoiseEee> if you're creating a big string though, you'd get more mileage / better performance in pushing each 'string' to an array, and then joining it
[09:28:51] <anew> ok so then this wont work
[09:28:59] <anew> i need to not have the closing tag
[09:29:11] <Cork> anew: dom can't represent that
[09:29:13] <NoiseEee> anew: you mean you dont want valid html?
[09:29:14] <Cork> it is not possible
[09:29:29] <NoiseEee> anew: still waiting for some type of use case / explaining wtf youre trying to do
[09:29:29] <anew> hmmm
[09:29:44] <anew> noiseEee please.. .ur nto helping
[09:30:09] <anew> argh damnit i dunno then
[09:30:15] <Cork> anew: when you do the append what the browser does is parse your string, and start to build a dom fragment
[09:30:33] <Cork> anew: this would contain a form element, and normally a list of input elements
[09:30:46] <Cork> the input elements would reference the form element as it's parent
[09:30:50] <Cork> that is how you get the structure
[09:30:53] <anew> yes
[09:30:59] <Cork> there is no close
[09:31:03] <Cork> just pointers
[09:31:38] <anew> ok have to see what else i can do here fack
[09:31:40] <anew> thx cork
[09:31:54] <Cork> [form internalid=1 parent=null] [input parent=1][input parent=1] and so on
[09:32:46] <Cork> and appending the form is just [form parent=id-of-element]
[09:32:55] <maxmoore14> speaking of DOM issues... anyone familiar with jqm pages? http://jsbin.com/IkIZUyI/1/edit?js
[09:33:58] <maxmoore14> I realize what I am doing is slow/dumb, just not sure how to force reloading of dynamic content on each visit to page
[09:38:15] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Kind Crimson is an awesome choice today.
[09:38:19] <BillCriswell> King*
[09:45:59] <Bloomberg> guys!!, I have attached the filtering rows in my jtable jquery plugin
[09:46:43] <Bloomberg> the first options works perfect, but there so on is attached and show me the same option selected in the first time.
[09:48:29] <fonko> guys is there anyway to escape single quotes of a javascript:somescript() that executes through the url?
[09:48:45] <Bloomberg> how can I destroy the data selected in a click function
[09:49:08] <fonko> because internet explorer transforms this cuts my link when finding javascript:(function(){$('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: $(\'#feed_footer1\').offset().top }, 2000);})();
[09:49:12] <fonko> sorry
[09:49:23] <talntid> Bloomberg closing the browser will do it
[09:49:24] <fonko> ie transform this javascript:(function(){$('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: $(\'#feed_footer1\').offset().top }, 2000);})();
[09:49:26] <fonko> into this
[09:49:36] <fonko> javascript:(function(){$('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: $(
[09:49:41] <fonko> javascript:(function(){$('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: $('
[09:49:54] <Bloomberg> Obviously, but without to close the browser

[09:54:33] <petey> its all the code for smooth scrolling and scrollto using bootstrap
[09:54:39] <petey> but i can't get an external link to work
[09:54:44] <petey> it just doesn't do anything
[09:54:50] <petey> i removed the data-slide portion but with no luck
[09:55:16] <bongjovi> Anyone have any experience with the latest version of masonry? Getting TypeError: item.hide is not a function when I try to use the hide method.
[09:55:27] <Haprog> petey: there is no html code?
[09:55:34] <anew> cork are you still there
[09:55:41] <petey> haprog, hold on a sec
[09:56:21] <petey> you can see a live example at http://hubbardinn.com
[09:56:22] <talntid> and the easing plugin isn't loaded
[09:56:27] <petey> there's a lot of plugins
[09:56:44] <petey> right now if you click "BOOKINGS", a about:blank opens up instead of the link
[09:56:57] <Haprog> petey: you should include some relevant html code in the fiddle to isolate the problem and be able to fiddle with it. that's the point of jsfiddle.
[09:57:20] <talntid> also, you are trying cross original stuff
[09:57:24] <talntid> that's a no-no
[09:57:28] <petey> Huh?
[09:57:36] <talntid> Blocked a frame with origin "https://www.youtube.com" from accessing a frame with origin "http://hubbardinn.com".  The frame requesting access has a protocol of "https", the frame being accessed has a protocol of "http". Protocols must match.
[09:58:00] <Haprog> petey: right now you have a fiddle that doesn't do anything. there's just some javascript code, but the result view is empty.
[09:58:12] <petey> Yeah I saw that error, tried googling it but something on stackoverflow said that's its osmething on googles end
[09:58:17] <talntid>     <div class="flex-video about-video"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JZqvP7pig8Q?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
[09:58:20] <talntid> chang ethat to...
[09:58:23] <petey> talntid do you have any resources on how I can fix that?
[09:58:26] <anew> http://pastebin.com/nHQw54bA can someone help me with this, should this be creating closing tags as well ?
[09:58:27] <talntid>     <div class="flex-video about-video"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/JZqvP7pig8Q?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
[09:58:50] <Haprog> gtg ->
[09:59:04] <BillCriswell> anew: I'd imagine the browser would add it automatically to keep you from screwing shit up.
[09:59:15] <petey> Ah easy enough, talntid - thanks
[09:59:24] <mink> Any easy way to remove part of object, if I have only reference to this?
[09:59:33] <anew> yeah but i need to not have it added... according to this question it should be working? right? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12948853/how-do-i-force-jquery-append-to-not-automatically-close-a-tag
[09:59:36] <anew> billcriswell ^
[10:01:59] <BillCriswell> Why don't you want it added? If you close it yourself it won't automatically close it... I feel like you're approaching something oddly.
[10:03:44] <anew> billcriswell i am closing it later
[10:04:00] <anew> i have a js tab set up, that cycles thru forms, i just need it closed later
[10:04:01] <BillCriswell> You might be putting in malformed HTML then.
[10:04:03] <anew> not at this exact moment
[10:04:26] <anew> i dont understand tho, why does it work for the guy on stackoverflow
[10:05:27] <Cork> anew: yes
[10:05:33] <Cork> (still here)
[10:05:43] <anew> cork i'm trying to do what this guy did http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12948853/how-do-i-force-jquery-append-to-not-automatically-close-a-tag
[10:05:47] <anew> http://pastebin.com/nHQw54bA
[10:05:47] <anew> here
[10:05:49] <anew> but not working ?
[10:06:25] <Cork> anew: if you check the response, the resulting html string is complete
[10:06:50] <anew> but i see his last tag is <tr>
[10:06:53] <anew> so he is not closing it in the append
[10:07:10] <Cork> and that will result in an <tr></tr> in the serialized html
[10:07:24] <Cork> noway around that
[10:07:28] <anew> mmm
[10:07:29] <anew> k
[10:07:30] <anew> damnit
[10:07:31] <anew> thx
[10:08:07] <BillCriswell> My brain.
[10:10:35] <hazardous> am i allowed to ask jqui question here
[10:10:36] <hazardous> or only jquery core
[10:11:49] <Cork> hazardous: this is the channel for jquery, ui, and mobile
[10:12:17] <Cork> though how fast you will find someone with an answer will vary :)
[10:12:31] <hazardous> haha
[10:12:44] <hazardous> any chance you know how i can do some kind of mutex on tooltips?
[10:12:52] <hazardous> if i mouseover more than one within a short while (like <200ms)
[10:12:57] <hazardous> i end up with ten tooltips open all over each other
[10:13:04] <hazardous> basically lock all other tooltips from running until one returns
[10:13:21] <Cork> sounds like something depending on how it does it's handling
[10:13:28] <hazardous> you wrote the handling code :P
[10:13:41] <hazardous> it's pretty much an ajax callback, and i guess it's async
[10:13:46] <Cork> ah
[10:13:49] <Cork> link?
[10:14:07] <hazardous> i dont have it online, but the js is uh
[10:14:23] <hazardous> http://sebsauvage.net/paste/?6659c5fb3b4a213a#fqk7wUV1yZ3cHSs1aXfKn1pgIcOxVzhtkdENHGsjZEY=
[10:14:53] <Cork> hmm no i didn't write that, i answered question about how to do it though :)
[10:15:07] <hazardous> haha
[10:15:20] <Cork> hazardous: you could for example check if there is any tooltip visible when the get callback triggers
[10:15:22] <hazardous> but yeah, should i be setting some global var or something and unsetting it during the callback
[10:15:23] <Cork> and hide them
[10:16:45] <Cork> hazardous: another solution that MIGHT work, is to have a close event and store the xhr object
[10:17:02] <Cork> hazardous: and if close is called while the ajax call is active, abort it
[10:17:27] <Cork> so something like $(this).data('request', $.get(...));
[10:17:42] <Cork> close: function() { $(this).data('content').abort(); }
[10:18:10] <Cork> hazardous: though i haven't tested that, so not sure if it works
[10:18:30] <hazardous> hm
[10:19:18] <Cork> opps
[10:19:29] <Cork> data('request') in the close section, not content
[10:22:11] <maxmoore14> anyone familiar with jqm pages? http://jsbin.com/IkIZUyI/1/edit?js
[10:30:47] <petey> how can I target an external link with an if statement?
[10:30:58] <petey> http://jsfiddle.net/uukpR/3/
[10:31:15] <petey> that function finds the #logo > div, once you click it, it'll call goToByScroll and scroll down to that area
[10:31:28] <petey> My problem is that I have 2 external links in the #logo > div area
[10:31:36] <petey> I just don't know how to target those external links in an if statement
[11:00:56] <Swayz> Hey, how can I replace (what kind of selector) the entire contents of the web page with .html()
[11:01:21] <anew> so i have a select being created with .append
[11:01:28] <anew> then i am tring to on('change'...
[11:01:32] <anew> that append
[11:01:40] <anew> but not working, can change work on an append ?
[11:02:50] <Swayz> stop tryin to steal my show anew
[11:03:44] <anew> wut
[11:03:54] <Swayz> my question 1st lol
[11:04:03] <anew> is this your first time in irc
[11:04:46] <NoiseEee> Swayz: presumably you'd just replace what was in <body>, no?
[11:04:53] <NoiseEee> Swayz: either way, fairly bad idea
[11:04:58] <Swayz> buncha jquery noobs up in hurr >_<
[11:05:00] <NoiseEee> anew: code sample on fiddle
[11:05:06] <anew> yeah
[11:05:30] <Swayz> NoiseEee, agreed!  I wish it was the body ;/
[11:05:56] <NoiseEee> Swayz: you don't get to replace all of the html. load a new page.
[11:06:06] <Swayz> thought so
[11:17:42] <anew> wrapall and wrapinner seem almost the same thing?
[11:17:58] <anew> and wrap! lol
[11:25:18] <BlaDe^> hi, can i ask about handlebars here?
[11:31:05] <rogeruiz> question about event testing with qunit. is there a reliable way to test complex events like orientationchange or resize with qunit? or would it just be easier to abstract that code out and pass a context to my testable js?
[11:51:17] <Bloomberg> How can I refresh the page automatically when a record is created in jtable jquery?
[11:54:58] <Krinkle> rogeruiz: Yeah, QUnit is for unit testing, not integration testing. So you shouldn't be binding like on('change', function () { logic; }) and testing whether that logic gets executed if you change the input field because that is (partly) testing whether the browser fires the event at all, which you should be assuming, and simulatniously it forces you to trigger the event just to test the logic.
[11:55:41] <Krinkle> Instead you'd probably bind like on('change', some.method) or on('change', function (e) { e.preventDefault(); some.method(this.value); }) and test some.method directly
[11:55:51] <rogeruiz> yeah. that's what I figured
[11:56:07] <rogeruiz> hmm okay. thanks Krinkle
[11:56:11] <Krinkle> yw

[12:49:11] <grafi> still the same :D
[12:49:17] <grafi> so whats your problem then? ^^
[12:58:02] <rainabba> In the following, console shows undefined. I imagine it's because when setTimeout fires, v isn't defined (not actually passed through as I intended) because of the async nature of setTimeout. If so, is there a way to accomplish this without an intermediate array to store the items to be acted agains? The point is that I want this to occur at a fixed pace and it feels like I'm close:
[12:58:02] <rainabba> jsfiddle.net/J3cgw/ or  $('selector').each(function(i, v) {  $(v).attr('tt',   window.setTimeout(function(v) {    console.log(v);    }, 150)  )  })
[12:58:15] <rainabba> http://jsfiddle.net/J3cgw/
[12:58:56] <nicetry> I have an area of my page that is scrollable.  Is it possible with javascript or jQuery to tell if an element in that area is visible? (not visible as in the css property but see-able in terms of scrolling)?
[12:59:13] <Whirl3d> what cryptic css do I have to add to my li elements to give them an "expand" triangle using jquery UI?
[12:59:53] <rainabba> nicetry: Here's the general idea: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/487073/check-if-element-is-visible-after-scrolling
[13:00:08] <nicetry> rainabba
[13:00:14] <nicetry> rainabba: thank you!
[13:00:31] <shoky> rainabba: why are you setting an attribute's value to the return value from setTimeout..?
[13:00:35] <rainabba> Whirl3d: You can use a jquery treeview add-on OR css. It's not really both.
[13:00:57] <rainabba> shoky: Short answer: Automated testing
[13:00:59] <rainabba> :)
[13:01:32] <grafi> rainabba what are you trying to accomplish... the code strikes me as odd
[13:01:44] <shoky> rainabba: okz. no argument is passed to the setTimeout callback. just remove the v from the argument list..
[13:01:55] <rainabba> I've dumbed down the question considerably after much effort get to the point (the undefined object reference in the siteTimeout callback)
[13:02:52] <rainabba> shoky: Gotcha!
[13:03:39] <rainabba> Gotta think of execution from the inside out compared to how I was thinking of it.
[13:05:27] <shoky> i'd re-think the whole approach.. to whatever it is you're doing ;p
[13:06:11] <anew> i know with html5 you can attribute an input outside a form to a specific form - can i do this with jquery ?
[13:08:33] <shoky> anew: it's just a "form" attribute, no?
[13:08:58] <anew> shoky i mean i have an <input> outside of my <form /> tags, i cannot move it to inside the form
[13:09:02] <anew> can i include it with jq ?
[13:09:30] <rainabba> shoky: TaDa! http://jsfiddle.net/J3cgw/1/
[13:10:10] <shoky> anew: if the browser supports the html5 form attribute, you can .attr('form', 'formId')
[13:10:27] <anew> ya i need to make it compatible with other browses
[13:10:31] <shoky> anew: jquery doesn't change how the browser handles forms
[13:10:32] <anew> wonder if there is another option
[13:10:38] <NCS_One> hi
[13:10:41] <anew> $('input:not(form input)').addClass('test');
[13:10:43] <anew> i can do this ?
[13:11:09] <shoky> don't see why not..
[13:11:21] <anew> let me try
[13:11:46] <rainabba> shoky: Actually, a bit better: http://jsfiddle.net/J3cgw/2/
[13:12:39] <shoky> rainabba: er, whatever dude ;P
[13:12:44] <rainabba> From that you can likely figure out my intention (parse objects on the page then act against them in a timed sequence, in an async manner (to simulate user input).
[13:12:56] <rainabba> shoky: You know you love me. You don't have to pretend.
[13:13:04] <rainabba> Thanks once again for the help.
[13:13:06] <shoky> ;D
[13:13:46] <NCS_One> how can I prevent this complete function from running twice? http://jsfiddle.net/YXtcR/
[13:16:40] <shoky> NCS_One: http://jsfiddle.net/YXtcR/1/
[13:21:19] <NCS_One> shoky: thanks
[13:22:57] <nooneelse> Hi everyone, I"m using $.ajax and success: function(){} inside that function it returns true or false, but, that $.ajax call is inside another function which do not return the true or false of the success function inside, how can I get it ?
[13:23:11] <Raydiation> any reason why this doesnt perform a GET request? http://jsfiddle.net/tXfHK/
[13:23:26] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/czhF8/ can i do this?  i'm trying to append an input when the user clicks a form submit
[13:23:36] <anew> status-submit-button1 is a button to submit a form
[13:23:41] <anew> but i'm not seeing post value citychangevalue
[13:24:43] <nooneelse> Raydiation, the test username and password are wrong
[13:25:20] <Raydiation> nooneelse: yes, but it should perform a request
[13:25:34] <shoky> Raydiation: it does
[13:25:47] <Raydiation> i dont see any in firebug
[13:25:56] <shoky> GET https://cloud.w1r3.org/index.php/apps/news/api/v1-2/version HTTP/1.1
[13:26:04] <NoiseEee> Raydiation: how else do you think you're being prompted for a user/pass?
[13:26:19] <nooneelse> NoiseEee, good point
[13:26:20] <Raydiation> i want to send them as headers
[13:26:26] <Raydiation> user + pass
[13:27:05] <nooneelse> again
[13:27:11] <nooneelse> the username and password are wrong
[13:27:12] <nooneelse> https://test:test@cloud.w1r3.org/index.php/apps/news/api/v1-2/version
[13:27:18] <nooneelse> this doesn't work
[13:27:21] <nooneelse> not even if I type
[13:28:04] <Raydiation> hm
[13:28:18] <nooneelse> does the "test" user exist or you just replaced for posting ?
[13:28:21] <Raydiation> this is the error "[Exception... \"Access to restricted URI denied\"  code: \"1012\" nsresult: \"0x805303f4 (NS_ERROR_DOM_BAD_URI)\"  location: \"http://localhost/news-mobile/www/vendor/jquery/jquery.js Line: 7774\"]"
[13:28:30] <Raydiation> nooneelse: yes
[13:28:40] <nooneelse> yes what ?
[13:28:46] <Raydiation> replaced for posting
[13:28:50] <nooneelse> oh ok
[13:29:06] <NoiseEee> well try the url in the format nooneelse suggested, with the correct user/pass
[13:29:22] <Raydiation> tried that, getting the error above
[13:31:15] <NoiseEee> Raydiation: and can you log into plain' ol https://cloud.w1r3.org/index.php/apps/news/api/v1-2/version with the user and pass?
[13:31:28] <Raydiation> yes
[13:31:38] <Raydiation> curl works too
[13:34:43] <NoiseEee> i wonder if passing the user/pass that way messes with what the browser thinks is same origin policy or osmething
[13:35:05] <Raydiation> i pass it as a seperate argument in the config object
[13:35:09] <Raydiation> not in the url
[13:35:30] <NoiseEee> so you didn't try the URL in the format nooneelse suggested then?
[13:35:55] <Raydiation> i did
[13:35:59] <Raydiation> doesnt work either
[13:36:09] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/czhF8/ can i do this?  i'm trying to append an input when the user clicks a form submit
[13:36:12] <anew> can anyone help me out on this one
[13:36:48] <anew> please
[13:36:53] <anew> trying to append an input to a form on submit
[13:38:07] <NoiseEee> anew: just clone the existing input (which if i followed you earlier, one exists) into the form, then submit it
[13:38:17] <NoiseEee> anew: but watch the submit event, not a button's 'click' event
[13:38:18] <anew> i got it... i missed the /> at the end
[13:38:24] <anew> oh should be submit?
[13:38:27] <NoiseEee> yes.
[13:38:35] <anew> why?
[13:38:48] <anew> ah if a user hits enter
[13:38:53] <grafi> because you can submit a form with something else than a click
[13:38:58] <NoiseEee> yep ^^
[13:38:59] <anew> ya
[13:39:03] <anew> thx man
[13:39:03] <NoiseEee> and you're really talking about the form, not a button.
[13:39:30] <anew> not sure what you meant by clone the existing input tho? what i'm doing will work wont it ?
[13:40:31] <myosotis> anew, http://jsfiddle.net/czhF8/1/
[13:41:39] <SuperrMann> Is there any reason why my sscript is loading really slow using winows load and document.ready just doesnt work it
[13:41:45] <SuperrMann> is there any reaosn why?
[13:41:48] <anew> whoa
[13:41:54] <anew> that's a lot more code myosotis
[13:42:27] <anew> why do the bottom part ?
[13:43:31] <myosotis> a lot more code??
[13:43:34] <daslicht> lol
[13:43:53] <myosotis> the first part is to set up a self executing function expression so we don't have to worry about whether the site maintainer has turned on jquery.noconflict
[13:43:59] <anew> ok 7 lines lol but why is it needed ?
[13:44:30] <myosotis> second part is to not execute javascript on dom elements that have not been loaded yet
[13:44:44] <myosotis> and the other 3 lines do what you were asking
[13:45:38] <myosotis> and I left your code in since it doesn't do anything *shrug*
[13:45:55] <PKKid> Is there a way to add a small hook into ALL ajax requests?
[13:46:06] <anew> wait so lines 1-4 do nothing? lol
[13:46:20] <myosotis> that was the fiddle you pasted
[13:46:24] <PKKid> ie: If any ajax request returns a special HTTP status code, I want to redirect to the login page.
[13:46:25] <myosotis> that was YOUR code
[13:46:31] <myosotis> you should have 0 questions about that part.
[13:46:36] <anew> yeah i mean it works over here
[13:46:38] <anew> i just left out the html
[13:47:11] <anew> btw one question
[13:47:14] <anew> why the preventdefault
[13:47:28] <myosotis> to keep this example form from actually submitting
[13:47:32] <anew> yeah figured
[13:47:34] <anew> ok thx man
[13:47:46] <PKKid> Or perhaps, if the ajax request returns an HTTP redirect.. I want to TOP level page to redirect, not the jquery ajax call to get the contents of the redirected page and return that.
[13:50:06] <daslicht> the example is getting errors here
[13:50:43] <anew> btw ... what are u guys doing when js doesnt load yet or properly
[13:50:44] <myosotis> PKKid, you can set the 'statusCode' property of a jquery ajax request, along with a function to run on that statuscode: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:50:51] <anew> for example if someone ninja clicks on a form... when the page is loading
[13:50:56] <anew> it screws everything up
[13:51:18] <myosotis> you could hide the form, and not display it until your javascript is set up
[13:51:23] <anew> true good idea
[13:51:27] <myosotis> or better yet, make the form work without javascript first
[13:51:30] <PKKid> myosotis, Thats perfect, but is there a way to link this into all the places I use $.ajax (as there are about 30 places I'd have to update if i do that)
[13:51:43] <anew> yeah i have that, but it basically makes the user click to go to another page
[13:51:45] <anew> which i hate
[13:51:48] <anew> would rather make them wait
[13:52:40] <PKKid> Ahh, it looks like I can use $.ajaxSetup()
[13:52:45] <myosotis> PKKid, that's out of my league, but I bet you could just alter the jquery prototype or something
[13:53:03] <PKKid> myosotis, This might be what I want: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/
[13:53:19] <myosotis> looks that way
[13:53:46] <anew> damnit... when i change to on("submit", it doesnt work
[13:53:49] <anew> but on("click", does
[13:53:59] <SuperrMann> can someone assist with a jquery window load problem i am having
[13:54:23] <daslicht> SuperrMann: post a fiddle
[13:54:26] <SuperrMann> http://www.niceicdirect.com/epages/NICShop.sf/en_GB/?ObjectPath=/Shops/NICShop/Products/5090 <<when someone opens this link, its forever for the image to move down so the tabs can move down
[13:54:32] <SuperrMann> is there any reason why?
[13:55:15] <daslicht> "when someone opens this link, its forever for the image to move down so the tabs can move down" ?
[13:55:20] <daslicht> i dont understand that sentence
[13:55:58] <ipc9> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'lightBox'
[13:56:52] <daslicht>     $('#gallery a').lightBox(); TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating '$('#gallery a').lightBox()')
[13:57:05] <myosotis> anew, you have to listen for the 'submit' event on a FORM element
[13:57:35] <SuperrMann> when i open the link, the image on the left hand side (the product image) has a jquery function called elevateZoom. At the current time, the tabs (description and Video) are currently on top of the product image
[13:57:43] <anew> oh
[13:57:44] <SuperrMann> after when the image has loaded, the tabs move down
[13:57:44] <anew> duh
[13:57:45] <anew> thx
[13:57:57] <ipc9> SuperrMann: use the developer tools in your fav browser and look at the console output...you got junk flying everywhere
[13:58:27] <daslicht> SuperrMann: i see
[13:58:43] <SuperrMann> ipc9 firebug fine?
[13:59:01] <PKKid> $.ajax can take 200:function() { ... } as an argument?
[13:59:03] <daslicht> just have a look at the browser console
[13:59:08] <ipc9> i prefer chrome, but sure
[14:01:03] <daslicht> SuperrMann: so you want that the tabs are not jumping doqn after load ?
[14:01:10] <dshap> Hey all - does anyone know why I might be getting Access-Control-Allow-Origin errors when trying to fetch a ".svg" file via jQuery/ajax, but I can run "curl -H 'Origin: http://mysite.com' http://cdn.mysite.com/my_file.svg" and it works just fine? it seems that the browser is canceling the request before it is even made? Chrome dev tools doesn't show me any response headers...
[14:01:52] <SuperrMann> daslicht what i want is the tabs to be located at the bottom of the product, it should never move, the image should load itself.
[14:02:04] <daslicht> SuperrMann: since teh page isnt responsive, you could just position the tabs absolute
[14:02:19] <daslicht> so that they are NOT dependant of the image above
[14:02:37] <SuperrMann> the image size varies on different products (automatic scaling)
[14:02:47] <daslicht> ohh i see :/
[14:02:49] <SuperrMann> so there might be a giant gap between the image and the description
[14:02:58] <daslicht> that suxx
[14:03:00] <daslicht> :)
[14:03:09] <SuperrMann> it does :(
[14:04:04] <daslicht> built a better :)
[14:04:09] <daslicht> build
[14:04:52] <Whirl3d> Isn't there a treeview-esque nested accordian-esque jquery plugin that isn't just for file structures?
[14:04:56] <SuperrMann> whats the different between document ready and windows load?
[14:09:17] <daslicht> http://4loc.wordpress.com/2009/04/28/documentready-vs-windowload/

[14:12:08] <SuperrMann> daslicht thanks for that. any other ideas to fix this issue?
[14:13:03] <daslicht> SuperrMann: Load the upper container and once its ready the other ?
[14:14:06] <daslicht> SuperrMann: Have you tried to view you page without js enabled? You will see that the tabs are ABOVE tghe upper area
[14:14:25] <daslicht> I woudl try to make it looking good without js enabled either maybe :)
[14:16:21] <daslicht> niceic.css:2074

[14:16:45] <rook2pawn> is there a way to .changePage('#foo?bar=3') in jquerymobile?
[14:17:05] <rook2pawn> the querystring is not getting propogated over
[14:17:39] <daslicht> SuperrMann: the conteiner above is pushing down yoy tabs after its ready initialized
[14:19:37] <SuperrMann> daslicht do you know how i can fix this? just looking at the css, it seems fine to me
[14:20:09] <daslicht> i dont know how to fix it , i just try to inspire you , have you looked at the page without js enabled?
[14:20:48] <SuperrMann> yeah, its weird, the css is not defined for it to be on the image
[14:22:38] <daslicht> when i navigate teh tabs teh page is also jumping
[14:22:48] <daslicht> since the scrollbar is shown :_)

[14:39:47] <ecurtis> hi, I was looking at adding the Widget Logic plugin which I have used in the past but it has not been updated in 8 months. Any alternate suggestions?
[14:40:05] <lorfds> anyone know of a good widget for updating images on a page
[14:40:40] <lorfds> each page is for a specific product, and each product can have multiple images
[14:40:47] <lorfds> i want the images to be user editable
[14:40:56] <lorfds> so you can delete/update/add an image
[14:41:18] <ecurtis> lorfds: perhaps Nextgen gallery
[14:41:46] <lorfds> is it useable outside wordpress?
[14:42:10] <ecurtis> lol, I am sorry, I was accidently giving you a wp answer

[14:51:12] <javalover> hello coding community I just wanted to share with you a tool I just picked up that has officially changed my life
[14:51:30] <fission6> anyone have code structure advice for https://dpaste.de/5W42A/
[14:51:42] <javalover> http://www.1space.dk/executor/index.html  this tool is an updated version of the run tool we have, I actually searched for this because I wanted to be able to google things faster
[14:52:15] <javalover> this guy idk who he is or why he did this, but it's incredible, I just set this thing up so that I can swap between windows using custom shortcuts, so like for irc ctrl shift I
[14:52:35] <javalover> I can literally hop into firefox, back to irc, back to notepad in a matter of miliseconds
[14:52:53] <javalover> and to top it all off, if I push ctrl R, an elite window shows up where I can google anything, or type in the url I want to test
[14:52:55] <doug65536> fission6: missing semicolon on line 15 and 17
[14:53:19] <javalover> i sware alt tabbing is a thing of the past, this tool makes life amazing
[14:53:21] <doug65536> fission6: shouldn't those be >=
[14:53:38] <javalover> now it does take some time to setup, but if you're willing trust me when I say it's worth it
[14:53:57] <javalover> imma also link you to the alt tab tool someone created for it, as it's a beast
[14:54:11] <javalover> http://executor.fr.yuku.com/reply/3543/Switch-between-active-applications#reply-3543
[14:54:27] <fission6> thanks doug65536 any pother general stuff
[14:54:31] <javalover> now hold on while i calculate 2 + 2 cuz it's fun lol
[14:55:17] <doug65536> fission6: the ifs could be reversed and else put before the if (percent >= 50) {
[14:55:43] <fission6> what would that offer
[14:55:48] <fission6> performance, readability?
[14:56:27] <doug65536> fission6: readibility is fine. performance is fine
[14:56:31] <fission6> yea
[14:56:36] <fission6> could use switch
[14:56:38] <fission6> whatever
[14:56:38] <fission6> works
[14:56:59] <doug65536> switch can't be used
[14:57:25] <doug65536> well, not without hurting readability
[15:00:37] <doug65536> ['progress-orange', 'progress-green'][progress/25>>0-2] || 'progress-red';    :D
[15:00:39] <doug65536> but no
[15:01:44] <doug65536> fission6: clever and unreadable ['progress-orange', 'progress-green'][(progress/25>>0)-2] || 'progress-red';
[15:01:58] <fission6> yea
[15:02:01] <fission6> ha
[15:05:20] <anew> so i'm making an ajax call and using on('click'... on an element from that ajax call
[15:05:29] <anew> why do i have to put the on inside the success of the ajax
[15:05:34] <anew> i cant just put it anywhere ?
[15:05:57] <doug65536> anew: the .ajax call returns long before the result is received
[15:06:11] <anew> what do u mean
[15:06:36] <doug65536> anew: .ajax starts the request in the background and returns immediately
[15:06:52] <anew> yes... but why cant i use click events outside the ajax call?
[15:06:55] <anew> for examle
[15:07:05] <anew> i am .append() in the success of the ajax call
[15:07:22] <doug65536> anew: because that code hasn't run yet?
[15:07:23] <anew> but whatever i append i cannot do anything to, unless i put the jq code inside the success as well
[15:07:51] <anew> no but after i append, i still cant do anything unless what i want to do is specifically inside the ajax
[15:08:10] <doug65536> anew: you're wrong
[15:08:22] <anew> rly i jus tried it... works inside not outside
[15:08:58] <doug65536> anew: well, I can't see the code but what you are saying is ridiculous: "I can't use .on outside an ajax call"
[15:09:16] <guest______> Hi can someone tell me how to use .fadeOut to hide all of the webpage then .fadeIn to show only one part?
[15:09:38] <doug65536> anew: I can believe, "I can't use on on something that doesn't exist"
[15:09:50] <doug65536> anew: (yet)
[15:10:29] <doug65536> anew: if you show code I'm sure I can explain what's happening
[15:11:01] <richwestcoast> as of late iv become the worlds biggest miley cyrus fan
[15:11:08] <richwestcoast> i just love her
[15:12:13] <anew> k
[15:12:30] <doug65536> anew: if you accept that the ajax call won't run until later - you can attach an event handler early to a parent of where the new thing will be created
[15:12:36] <kanja> what does a selector that starts with + mean?
[15:12:45] <kanja> $("+ ul")
[15:13:19] <guest______> i tried to use var progArr = []; var progNum = 0;   progArr[0] = "<div1>";      $("*").fadeOut();      $("#"+progArr[progNum]).fadeIn();    (this is supposed to allow a dynamic "next" button)
[15:14:01] <EHLOVader> Has anyone in here dealt with Select2 or even potentially chosen having performance issues in IE8?
[15:14:09] <javalover> oh my god this tool is amazing!
[15:14:11] <doug65536> kanja: not sure what that would mean. A + B normally means, match where B comes after A
[15:14:30] <EHLOVader> hoping for something, but i am going through the code and updating selectors to use tags and not just classes
[15:14:34] <EHLOVader> hoping it would help
[15:14:42] <guest______> i also hardcoded the div that i want to fade in but it still doesnt work
[15:14:46] <doug65536> kanja: as siblings, not parent/child
[15:14:50] <kanja> doug65536: right yeah - I'm looking through someone else's code
[15:15:10] <kanja> and they have a bunch of selectors like  $("> ul", this).slideToggle();  or                             $("+ ul", this).slideToggle();
[15:15:17] <kanja> and I've never seen that before
[15:15:23] <doug65536> kanja: ah
[15:15:37] <doug65536> kanja: that uses the 2 parameter form of $()
[15:15:45] <kanja> right a scoped selector
[15:15:58] <kanja> is the + smart enough to apply to the scope of the selector?
[15:16:09] <doug65536> kanja: ok so $('+ a', this)  would mean  <whatever this is> + a
[15:16:14] <kanja> yeah ok
[15:16:16] <kanja> that makes sense
[15:16:43] <doug65536> kanja: I guess! I've never tried it but that's the only thing that would really make sense to me
[15:17:16] <kanja> yeah
[15:19:45] <anew> http://pastebin.com/MKebG9tJ doug65536
[15:20:06] <anew> line 1-4 does not work... but if it's inside the success of the ajax
[15:20:08] <anew> it does
[15:23:04] <doug65536> anew: well yes, because #city-profile1 doesn't exist yet. however, you can do $('#nbody').on('click', '#city-profile1', function() ....   early
[15:23:37] <anew> i see
[15:23:43] <anew> so if i do that outside the ajax
[15:23:44] <anew> it's ok
[15:23:44] <anew> let me try
[15:25:45] <anew> oh sweet that worked
[15:26:05] <anew> thx
[15:26:10] <doug65536> anew: yw
[15:30:42] <Dreamer3> does jquery really have no built in way to scroll a certain element into view?
[15:30:59] <doug65536> Dreamer3: it does - it specially handles scrollTop
[15:31:40] <Dreamer3> that doesn''t sound ike what i want
[15:31:46] <Dreamer3> i want to scroll the page to "#section"
[15:32:13] <doug65536> $(document.body).animate({scrollTop: $('#section').offset().top})

[15:38:16] <Dreamer3> thanks
[15:41:33] <PhaseCode> Hey guys I'm having some trouble, http://jsfiddle.net/LDXJS/1/ if you click inside the textbox the save button appears and change the text inside the textbox, then click anywhere in the box and the save button goes away, however, upon clicking on the text box again it reverts the changes, can I get any help?
[15:42:02] <rook2pawn> i want to share a URL in the form of #foo?bar=3 .. but the querystring gets eliminated in jquerymobile (bar=3)
[15:43:15] <rook2pawn> particularly when I am going to .changePage('#foo?bar=3')
[15:44:51] <doug65536> rook2pawn: did you see my reply?
[15:44:58] <doug65536> rook2pawn: put the hash after the query parameter
[15:45:05] <doug65536> rook2pawn: ?bar=3#foo
[15:45:31] <rook2pawn> .changePage('?bar=3#foo') results in going to /?bar=3
[15:45:57] <doug65536> rook2pawn: why do you have ? in your hash. that's asking for trouble imho
[15:45:58] <rook2pawn> the #pageid is totally lost if you put it after the querystring
[15:46:20] <say2joe> its probably parsing it as a hex number?
[15:46:39] <say2joe> or, its using a regexp with /w+
[15:46:49] <say2joe> or [A-z0-9-_]
[15:47:14] <doug65536> shouldn't you urlencode the ?
[15:47:41] <rook2pawn> that has nothing to do with it
[15:47:44] <doug65536> nevermind, I guess you don't need to
[15:47:58] <doug65536> rook2pawn: ok sounds like you got it all figured out them
[15:47:59] <rook2pawn> ?bar=baz i just used 3 as an example
[15:48:24] <doug65536> rook2pawn: why ?
[15:48:40] <doug65536> rook2pawn: you know what '?' means in a url, right?
[15:49:03] <rook2pawn> it indicates the beginning of a query parameter
[15:49:07] <rook2pawn> what about it
[15:49:16] <doug65536> exactly, so why is that after the hash
[15:50:03] <rook2pawn> because the location i am going to is designated by #foo refined by the query parameter ?bar=baz
[15:50:21] <doug65536> ok, then do that. good luck
[15:50:44] <rook2pawn> well, that's what im asking about
[15:50:58] <rook2pawn> jquerymobile is elimnating the query portion
[15:51:04] <doug65536> you're telling me that it has nothing to do with it
[15:51:24] <doug65536> can you eliminate the ? just to humor me?
[15:51:34] <doug65536> that's my first suspicion
[15:52:03] <doug65536> someone thought they were writing fast code and just searched for ? or something
[15:53:24] <doug65536> encodeURIComponent('?')
[15:53:25] <doug65536> "%3F"
[15:53:30] <snover> so itâ€™s just jmobile?
[15:53:41] <rook2pawn> yes, this is just jquerymobile related
[15:53:47] <doug65536> rook2pawn: try encoding/decoding your hash through encodeURIComponent
[15:53:52] <snover> woooooooooooooooooooooooooowoooooooosh
[15:54:01] <doug65536> decodeURIComponent
[15:56:26] <doug65536> rook2pawn: you are putting the hash there with location.hash / location.replace('#...')  right?
[15:56:58] <rook2pawn> no, i am using jquerymobile's internal changePage function
[15:57:24] <doug65536> where does the hash come from then>
[15:57:47] <rook2pawn> have you not worked with jqm before?
[15:58:13] <doug65536> ignoring you
[16:03:21] <PhaseCode> Can anyone help me?
[16:05:29] <Whirl3d_> PhaseCode, your mother logged in and said you should come home...no more video games...no one can help you...  what's your question?
[16:05:36] <PhaseCode> Hey guys I'm having some trouble, http://jsfiddle.net/LDXJS/1/ if you click inside the textbox the save button appears and change the text inside the textbox, then click anywhere in the box and the save button goes away, however, upon clicking on the text box again it reverts the changes, can I get any help?
[16:05:42] <PhaseCode> hahaha thats funny tho xD
[16:06:45] <Whirl3d_> PhaseCode, turn off you click handler after you active the textbox
[16:07:33] <PhaseCode> How would I do that? stopPropagation?
[16:08:04] <iaj> Hm can someone see my mistake?  I want to have default values for input fields, but if someone leaves the field empty.. the default values should be restored.
[16:08:08] <iaj> http://bpaste.net/show/127291/
[16:08:11] <Whirl3d_> actually change you handler to focus()...i'll show you gimme a second
[16:08:21] <PhaseCode> Thank you!
[16:14:26] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/LDXJS/2/
[16:16:49] <PhaseCode> Whirl3d_: I want it to save tho :(
[16:20:55] <Whirl3d_> Save where?
[16:21:13] <Whirl3d_> Why have a save button if it's not going to clear if you Don't press save?
[16:21:15] <doug65536> Whirl3d_: if they click won't blue happen before button click?
[16:21:21] <doug65536> blur*
[16:21:46] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/LDXJS/2/
[16:22:21] <doug65536> Whirl3d_: the blur fires before the button can even start to be pressed
[16:22:33] <sammych> arschmitz: you here, buddy?
[16:22:36] <Whirl3d_> I removed the blur event
[16:22:49] <doug65536> Whirl3d_: oh well you posted same link though
[16:23:00] <Whirl3d_> jsfiddle didn't update?
[16:23:08] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/LDXJS/3/
[16:23:11] <PhaseCode> Whirl3d_: Sorry, when you hit the save button its supposed to get rid of the button and keep the text
[16:23:15] <doug65536> you didn't copy the url
[16:23:28] <Whirl3d_> Must've missed it. LOL
[16:23:38] <doug65536> yeah I've done that before :)
[16:23:40] <Whirl3d_> Now it's not working. LOL
[16:24:22] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/LDXJS/4/

[16:24:48] <jhoffmcd> can i use the success function with ajax to reload a section of php/html?
[16:25:12] <jhoffmcd> I'm sending a new variable via POST, and need it to change the content
[16:25:59] <doug65536> jhoffmcd: yes
[16:26:07] <doug65536> jhoffmcd: .load
[16:26:23] <doug65536> jhoffmcd: or .html, or something - depends
[16:27:19] <jhoffmcd> doug65536: thanks! ill research both and see what I can come up with
[16:27:31] <doug65536> PhaseCode: there is a placeholder attribute that shows text in empty fields http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/LDXJS/6/
[16:27:43] <doug65536> PhaseCode: may not work in all browsers though
[16:30:14] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/LDXJS/9/
[16:32:16] <PhaseCode> Wow nice Whirl3d_!!! Thank you so much!
[16:39:46] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/LDXJS/18/
[16:40:03] <Whirl3d_> PhaseCode, now you can revert, save and clear...lol
[16:45:03] <jp-> when i specify an effect, puff, for example on a jquery-ui dialog via the show option, the dialog appears in the top left corner and when the effect completes it then centersâ€¦ any idea what might be causing this, is it a known issue? can't dig out much searching.
[16:45:54] <PhaseCode> hey what method would I use to have javascript code execute when the page is done being loaded?
[16:46:01] <PhaseCode> I've tried .ready but its executing too soon?
[16:46:07] <PhaseCode> or when a element is done being loaded
[16:46:23] <Whirl3d_> $(function () {   your code });
[16:47:00] <Whirl3d_> jp- create a jsfiddle to duplicate the problem
[16:48:06] <PhaseCode> Okay, one more question Whirl3d_: how about when an element is seen on the page?
[16:48:27] <PhaseCode> like if they were to scroll into a div and I want a pop-up
[16:48:29] <Whirl3d_> "seen on the page"...what do you mean by that
[16:48:56] <Whirl3d_> Okay that's trickier You need a plugin called something like "inView" or ...
[16:49:09] <Whirl3d_> it helps determine if an element is in the viewport
[16:49:44] <Whirl3d_> http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/viewport
[16:49:46] <Whirl3d_> maybe?
[16:52:35] <Whirl3d_> but why assign the click handler only when in the viewport. It doesn't do anything until you can see it..
[16:53:23] <jp-> i can't reproduce it because it set a position: fixed rule for .ui-dialogâ€¦. and I have no idea why i did that.
[16:53:28] <jp-> anyway, that was the problem.
[16:53:41] <Whirl3d_> jp- great.
[16:54:01] <jp-> may have had something to do with scrolling the page.
[16:54:52] <jp-> that was it, to keep the dialogs in view when scrolling.
[16:55:08] <doug65536> PhaseCode: undo redo? http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/G3BjY/
[17:05:18] <Whirl3d_> which element scrolls when the page scrolls? $(document.body) doesn't fire the scroll event. is it $(document)?
[17:06:31] <retran> http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[17:06:59] <retran> you mean $(window).scroll(function () { /*do somethin*/})
[17:07:20] <PhaseCode> I came up to a alternative solution just now
[17:07:21] <PhaseCode> I didn't realize
[17:07:25] <PhaseCode> theres a timeout function
[17:09:20] <PhaseCode> You guys are great!
[17:09:33] <PhaseCode> Thank you so much! One day I will be able to join you guys in the guru ranks <3!
[17:12:01] <Whirl3d_> anybody got a good solution for knowing when scrolling has stopped on the window? Or should I just check the mouse events on an interior element that scrolls?
[17:14:19] <PhaseCode> http://jsfiddle.net/yhnKR/10/
[17:14:20] <PhaseCode> Try that
[17:14:23] <PhaseCode> Whirl3d_
[17:15:12] <Whirl3d_> PhaseCode, brilliant. thanks
[17:20:26] <PhaseCode> Thanks Whirl3d_!!
[17:26:28] <Whirl3d_> I wonder if you could extend jquery to have scroll2 (callback, config) {     where config.start=start callback() and config.stop=stop callback and config.timeout would be delay before calling timeout?
[17:28:42] <PhaseCode> You could
[17:28:47] <PhaseCode> you would have to write a wrapper for it
[17:35:00] <Whirl3d_> I can get the stopped callback to work, but not the start
[17:37:11] <Whirl3d_> got it...
[17:37:18] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/yhnKR/13/
[17:37:39] <Whirl3d_> wonder why $.fn.scroll isn't setup like that by default
[17:40:01] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/yhnKR/14/
[17:40:19] <Whirl3d_> fades the document on scroll start, fades back in on scroll stop...
[17:43:46] <doug65536> I wrote you a plugin http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/EMhCt/
[17:44:37] <doug65536> Whirl3d_: ^
[17:45:52] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/yhnKR/15/
[17:46:01] <Whirl3d_> looking now.
[17:47:21] <Whirl3d_> I added $("element").scrollStart() and $("element").scrollStop() callbacks to $("element").scroll2();  LOL this is fun
[17:48:23] <doug65536> fixed it to handle changing the timeout properly http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/EMhCt/10/  (by calling .scroll2(n) again)
[17:48:38] <sweb> how can i get desire output like this http://jsfiddle.net/tyCFU/
[17:49:10] <doug65536> Whirl3d_: your plugin will break if $ is not jquery
[17:49:10] <sweb> i need to merge values in array recursive with jquery ... but same key will overwrite second object
[17:49:25] <Whirl3d_> sure, but that's an easy fix...right?
[17:49:37] <sweb> http://jsfiddle.net/tyCFU/1/
[17:50:05] <doug65536> Whirl3d_: and your variables aren't scoped. just some constructive criticisms :)
[17:50:54] <doug65536> Whirl3d_: you should use custom event, so they will bubble like real events
[17:51:06] <Whirl3d_> custom event?
[17:51:13] <doug65536> .trigger
[17:51:14] <b-ot> doug65536: broadcasting an event out
[17:52:12] <doug65536> neat, why was b-ot so quick? normally it takes forever to get a response :)
[17:53:11] <doug65536> sweb: extend doesn't do that
[17:53:24] <sweb> doug65536: how can do that ?
[17:53:25] <doug65536> sweb: it won't magically merge together array contents
[17:53:49] <doug65536> sweb: b[2] will overwrite a[2]
[17:54:10] <sweb> doug65536: yeap problem's  that
[17:58:01] <clime> hey, with $.on, what to do If I have a jquery object for the second parameter (the selector) and the string?. I want to limit the event only to a certain descendant of the jquery object.
[17:58:24] <clime> *and _not_ the string
[17:58:28] <doug65536> sweb: your desired is wrong, look at this code's console output http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/tyCFU/3/
[17:58:46] <doug65536> I think it's wrong...
[17:59:03] <doug65536> sweb: wait, what am I thinking...
[17:59:43] <doug65536> sweb http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/tyCFU/4/
[17:59:56] <clime> I guess I need to perform checking in the handler unless there is a way to convert jquery object back into selector string.
[18:02:49] <clime> hmm I can see there is a property prevObject.selector...maybe I could use that
[18:03:44] <doug65536> clime: why not just put the handler right on the object?
[18:04:24] <sweb> doug65536: ty
[18:07:41] <clime> doug65536: because i am stupid xD, thx
[18:09:09] <doug65536> clime: if you *really* had to uniquely identify something, you could use .data('uniqueid', ++unique_id)  then use '[data-uniqueid=' + unique_id
[18:09:18] <doug65536> + ']'
[18:29:36] <sweb> i wanna desire out put http://jsfiddle.net/weumf/
[18:57:52] <Zackko> How can I grab the <script> element itself using jQuery? Ex: <script>jQuery("<â€” This Script Element â€”>");</script>
[19:02:10] <sparr> I have a collection of elements, all with a stroke attribute. I want a list of those attribute values. How might I get that?
[19:10:03] <wrp6> I've got a particularly difficult bug to solve with one of my pages; one of my callbacks is being fired arbitrary number of times, the number of which actually seems to increment whenever I refresh
[19:10:18] <wrp6> But I was just curious if there is a way to determine how any functions are attached to a particular $.Callbacks() instance
[19:10:24] <wrp6> via .add()
[19:13:30] <doug65536> wrp6: what do you mean by "refresh"
[19:14:28] <doug65536> wrp6: you probably need to .remove before you .add
[19:15:46] <wrp6> refresh the page
[19:15:56] <wrp6> It is probably not a problem diagnosable with anything i've said
[19:16:08] <wrp6> I just wanted to know if it's possible to determine how many callbacks have been regeistered
[19:16:24] <wrp6> (refresh the page, or re-load it directly, for that matter. Very odd)
[19:16:31] <doug65536> wrp6: I looked through the docs... it wasn't clear how to get that
[19:16:41] <doug65536> what about callbacks.length
[19:17:01] <doug65536> just a guess
[19:17:38] <wrp6> Ah, i'll tr yhtat
[19:21:11] <shoky> it's not possible to get at it, wrp6
[19:38:09] <tw2113> feel like smacking a bitch shoky ?
[19:42:10] <Whirl3d_> doug65536, I am not sure how to do what you said to do...can't even remember what that was. All I know is this is not working: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/yhnKR/33/
[19:42:51] <doug65536> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'scrollTimer' of undefined
[19:43:08] <Whirl3d_> tell me about it.
[19:43:09] <Whirl3d_> lol
[19:43:27] <doug65536> don't stick random stuff in this...
[19:43:38] <doug65536> use $.data(this, 'someName', 'my_value')
[19:43:42] <Whirl3d_> random stuff?
[19:44:09] <Whirl3d_> yeah. why didn't you like the version that used all temporary variables?
[19:45:14] <doug65536> I'm just going by jquery plugin guidelines
[19:45:26] <doug65536> for plugin authors
[19:45:44] <doug65536> you should also "namespace" your data
[19:45:52] <doug65536> "someName.somePluginName"
[19:46:09] <clime> Whirl3d_: hey that error is caused because "this" has changed the context in resetTimer
[19:46:42] <Whirl3d_> clime, I hate that version. It's like trying to stick a marshmallow in a parking meter.
[19:47:24] <Whirl3d_> though messy, this version works: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/yhnKR/15/
[19:47:43] <Whirl3d_> still needs tweaking...considerable tweaking..
[19:47:56] <tw2113> not twerkin'
[19:48:24] <Whirl3d_> I live in Atlanta, I know twerkin when I see it. LOL
[19:48:54] <clime> Whirl3d_: that version seems cleaner
[19:49:04] <clime> i mean by code look
[19:49:26] <Whirl3d_> but doug65536 has a point in so much as it's not namespaced, not up to coding standards.
[19:49:44] <Whirl3d_> the other version was a lame attempt at namespacing, etc.
[19:50:18] <clime> doug65536: well he is pro. He probably has different point of view.
[19:50:46] <clime> i mean Whirl3d_: xD
[19:50:56] <digitalice> hi!
[19:51:05] <digitalice> hello!
[19:51:17] <clime> well maybe he would code it nicely with namespace and stuff :)
[19:51:17] <Whirl3d_> digitalice, hello
[19:51:49] <digitalice> hey, got a question over here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18479105/show-more-less-items-using-jquery
[19:52:01] <digitalice> no big deal
[19:52:30] <doug65536> clime: I wrote one already. not the same as whirl3d's though. it gives you a "debounced" scroll2 event after the scroll has stopped for some specified time http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/EMhCt/10/
[19:53:08] <doug65536> clime: whirl3d's also gives you a "scroll started" and "scroll stopped", I think
[19:55:16] <clime> doug65536: looks nice, i even understand it a bit
[19:56:26] <rook2pawn> is there a way to use parameters in #pages in jquerymobile?
[19:56:50] <doug65536> clime: still trying to break my c_naming_convention habit and start using camelCase every time :)
[20:02:21] <digitalice> anyone? :D
[20:09:42] <rook2pawn> doug65536: hi
[20:09:42] <digitalice> Whirl3d_: nobody ...
[20:11:37] <Whirl3d_> doug65536, I have made the executive decision that what works, works. Period. I am sick of messing with this tonight. Here's my latest failed attempt at namespacing or whatever: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/yhnKR/42/
[20:20:08] <Whirl3d_> digitalice, what are you trying to do?
[20:20:33] <digitalice> Whirl3d_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18479105/show-more-less-items-using-jquery
[20:20:36] <digitalice> that
[20:21:12] <Whirl3d_> tell ya what, you work with me and I'll work with you. Your stackoverflow question doesn't make sense to me. So tell me in plain terms what you want
[20:21:13] <digitalice> is there any jquery plugin that does this: http://jsfiddle.net/cUUfS/179/ ?
[20:21:32] <Whirl3d_> I don't know all the jquery plugins. You example seems broken to me
[20:21:41] <digitalice> Whirl3d_: cool
[20:21:49] <Whirl3d_> I click on a button and they all disappear
[20:22:31] <digitalice> Whirl3d_: what? really?
[20:22:56] <Whirl3d_> I can't really tell what you are trying to accomplish.
[20:24:09] <digitalice> Whirl3d_: It works for me :S
[20:24:25] <digitalice> Whirl3d_: i've got a bunch of elements
[20:24:39] <digitalice> and I want to show them by stages
[20:25:03] <digitalice> first 10, then press "show more" and then 10 more ...
[20:27:42] <Whirl3d_> gimme a minute
[20:28:21] <digitalice> Whirl3d_: ok :)
[20:40:05] <Whirl3d_> I give up. jsfiddle causes my browser to lockup and turn 50% opacity for a good 5 seconds every 30 seconds. Anything I type during that time --complete mess. jsfiddle has really just become the worst. I can't even use it any more.
[20:41:06] <digitalice> Whirl3d_: :S
[20:41:20] <digitalice> Whirl3d_: works fine for me ...
[20:41:34] <digitalice> Whirl3d_: wtf
[20:42:42] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/cUUfS/189/
[20:43:39] <Whirl3d_> that's the bloated verbose mode so see how it works. but it could be done in a line or two
[20:50:07] <digitalice> Whirl3d_: cool, thanks, I'll check it out :D
[20:56:06] <Whirl3d_> digitalice, here's a shorter version: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/cUUfS/197/
[20:57:41] <doug65536> Whirl3d_: I love jsfiddle. it works 100% perfect in chrome in my experience
[20:58:02] <doug65536> Whirl3d_: in FF there are some issues
[20:58:39] <doug65536> if FF would fix some of their silly performance bugs, it would make an ass of chrome. FF has WAY faster javascript
[20:59:49] <Whirl3d_> In Chrome (cool novo) I get port error on jsfiddle...
[21:01:06] <abjorn> probably a plugin
[21:01:13] <abjorn> adblock gives me that all the time
[21:03:00] <Whirl3d_> I used to be a huge jsfiddle fan, but the latest versions just don't work for me. I prefer jsbin by far
[21:03:41] <doug65536> I don't like it at all. reasons: crappy autoindent and syntax highlighting
[21:04:35] <Whirl3d_> but realtime updates wins hands down.
[21:06:12] <doug65536> what do you do? go lookup a cdn for jquery every time you make a jsbin?
[21:06:21] <doug65536> then type out a script tag manually?
[21:07:21] <Whirl3d_> I say include library...
[21:07:28] <Whirl3d_> It adds it for me...
[21:07:34] <Whirl3d_> along with css for jquery UI
[21:07:48] <Whirl3d_> it's a menu option
[21:08:45] <Whirl3d_> and when I had a problem with it, I reported it on git and within 24 hours, the author replied and had it fixed. jsfiddle, not so much.
[21:29:05] <hazardous> prbaobly weird but is it just me or is slideDown and fadeIn on a lot of elements smooth on chrome but jerky on ff
[21:31:45] <Blacklite> probably
[21:31:48] <Blacklite> chrome is very smooth
[21:31:55] <doug65536> compare my 3d slider between chrome and ff http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/aTsyS/
[21:32:47] <doug65536> linux FF is awful!
[21:43:32] <hazardous> i'm on windows ff, dual monitor side by side
[21:43:40] <hazardous> using javascript new Date()
[21:43:46] <hazardous> my chrome entire clalback completes in 463ms
[21:43:49] <hazardous> firefox takes 2844ms
[21:43:54] <hazardous> which is mostly spent just frozen
[21:43:57] <hazardous> until the entire page pops out at once
[22:04:12] <Whirl3d_> are you using css transforms?
[22:05:28] <Whirl3d_> You could do your slidedown and fadeIn with css transforms and limit the js needed while taking advantage of hardware accelleration
[22:06:45] <Whirl3d_> anybody any good with snap scrolling?
[22:48:52] <neworder> Hi guys
[22:49:01] <neworder> I need to make a product comparison table like this
[22:49:22] <neworder> http://tabletnation.com/compare
[22:50:01] <neworder> Is there any tutorials you can refer me to
[22:50:22] <neworder> I tried googling but didn't find anything useful yet
[22:50:55] <neworder> In particular, the product column is dynamically added
[22:51:31] <neworder> I'm not sure how to do that
[23:29:09] <Whirl3d_> Hello all. Kinda quiet in here tonight.
[23:29:46] <thump_> yes
[23:40:47] <Whirl3d_> Can someone help me to figure out some math?
[23:41:42] <Whirl3d_> I have a scrolling div with equal sized divs in it. I need to know which div has the greatest percent of itself showing at any given moment.
[23:50:51] <neworder> I need to make a product comparison table like this
[23:50:56] <neworder> http://tabletnation.com/compare
[23:51:02] <neworder> Is there any tutorials you can refer me to
[23:51:15] <neworder> In particular, the product column is dynamically added, I'm not sure how to do that
[23:51:33] <Whirl3d_> Not really, neworder. I've used that site and it's complicated.
[23:52:26] <doug65536> Whirl3d_: area = width * height. but you mean you need to detect how much is clipped off and use visible area?
[23:55:10] <grafi> you must have some idea where to start neworder, no?
[23:55:26] <neworder> yup
[23:55:37] <grafi> so start from there?
[23:55:37] <grafi> ^^
[23:55:39] <neworder> dynamically add rows using jquery
[23:55:56] <neworder> but I'm not sure how to sort though
[23:56:07] <doug65536> neworder: I looked at the page in element debugger. they simply add new <td> elements to each row
[23:56:19] <neworder> Ah I see
[23:56:32] <neworder> The product information is all loaded dynamically or upon page load
[23:56:40] <neworder> I have to load lots of products
[23:56:52] <neworder> so do I have to do it using ajax?
[23:57:01] <grafi> yup
[23:57:06] <grafi> i you want
[23:57:07] <grafi> ^
[23:57:10] <grafi> if
[23:57:40] <doug65536> neworder: you don't have to do anything, but ajax will prevent having to load everything up front
