[00:02:41] <bacobart> Mark_2, http://kreaturamedia.com/layerslider-wordpress-full-width-slider/
[00:03:50] <Mark_2> thanks for the link, but i don’t think it is the same slider.
[00:04:32] <bacobart> http://demo.qodeinteractive.com/bridge/wp-content/plugins/LayerSlider/static/css/layerslider.css?ver=5.2.0
[00:04:37] <bacobart> look at the header, it mentions that site
[00:05:07] <bacobart> also http://demo.qodeinteractive.com/bridge/wp-content/plugins/LayerSlider/static/js/layerslider.kreaturamedia.jquery.js?ver=5.2.0
[00:05:11] <bacobart> so i'm pretty sure it's the same
[00:05:20] <Mark_2> oh.
[00:07:01] <Mark_2> i should probably just run HTTrack to get it
[00:12:33] <bacobart> its a commercial plugin, so you should pay for it, or find something else to use :)
[00:14:22] <Mark_2> it’s very hard to make even the navigation menu. and i don’t know why it is so hard.
[00:15:06] <Mark_2> seems to be about 50% of the websites from design industry are using the exact same menu bar.
[01:01:16] <enigmabomb> Robdgreat: Thank you! That was it!
[01:16:40] <cuci> hi guys I'm trying to submit a form like so: http://jsbin.com/gucizuvelu/1/ but e.preventDefault does not get executed on submit. Any ideas why?
[02:18:29] <Chulbul> Is there anyone with whom I can discuss about HighCharts.js ?
[02:32:43] <sammych2> Thoughts: for brainstorming and general idea scribbling including EML diagramming, is using a graphics tablet a bit of a 'waste' or overkill instead of using paper and pen?
[02:45:42] <Chulbul> what kind of chart should be used to display ranks on daily basis, lowest rank must be highest on the graph but right now highest value is showing on the top?
[03:02:00] <rb__> Hi, I need an advice, I'm an experienced back-end dev, and have basic understanding of JS and jQuery and used both multiple times for simple front-end interactions! Now I'm developing an app that's a bit heavy on async server-side validation, I'v read "javascript, the good parts" to better my understanding, and took some courses on Ember and Angular, and still feel like instead of offering a hand of help,
[03:02:11] <rb__> these frameworks wanna take over my whole front-end (which I'm not proficient enough to let them do), I'v also just started looking at Backbone! You see, all I need is a "better" and more "modular" jQuery to help with heavy ajax requests and "organized" DOM manipulations, Any recommendations if I wanna get started soon without having to learn a WHOLE framework?! Thanks
[03:05:11] <bacobart> rb__: have a look at knockoutjs
[03:05:20] <bacobart> it's mvvm for the frontend
[03:05:35] <bacobart> kinda like ember/react/angular but less heavy imho
[03:06:28] <rb__> bacobart, thanks, I'll give it alook, hope it's what I'm looking for!
[03:07:07] <bacobart> well i'm a backend dev too and found knockout easy enough to get started with but also powerful enough to get done what i need from it
[03:07:11] <bacobart> but yeah ymmv :P
[03:08:00] <rb__> bacobart, have you tried backbone? if so how was your experience?
[03:08:14] <bacobart> no i havent, i've looked at ember/react/angular
[03:08:25] <bacobart> found those either weird or too heavy
[03:09:29] <rb__> Alright, I'll give knockout a look, thanks man!
[03:09:34] <bacobart> in knockout you don't manipulate the dom yourself, you just update your viewmodel (a js object)
[03:09:38] <bacobart> and knockout takes care of updating the dom
[03:09:56] <rb__> Oh, that's interesting
[03:10:04] <rb__> sounds like what I'm looking for
[03:10:30] <rb__> What were the resources that helped you get started the most?
[03:10:37] <bacobart> their website and stackoverflow :p
[03:10:41] <bacobart> their documentation is pretty good
[03:10:50] <bacobart> enough to get you started in my experience
[03:11:17] <rb__> Alright, I'll give it a look. Happy new year!
[03:11:24] <bacobart> cheers, you too

[05:55:47] <cuci> hi guys I'm trying to submit a form like so: http://jsbin.com/gucizuvelu/1/ but e.preventDefault does not get executed on submit. Any ideas why?
[05:57:55] <Omar-> cuci no jquery is linked in your jsbin
[05:58:12] <Omar-> and you have to wrap your code in $(function () { your code });
[05:58:23] <Omar-> or $(document).ready(function () { code });
[05:58:33] <cuci> ah! Sorry I'm new to this
[06:01:54] <cuci> Omar-: http://jsbin.com/toyedoquli/1/edit
[06:01:58] <cuci> Is this better?
[06:04:20] <Omar-> cuci http://jsbin.com/hajupitola/1/edit?html
[06:06:50] <DevAntoine> hi
[06:07:03] <DevAntoine> what's the best way to listen for dom manipulations?
[06:07:12] <DevAntoine> I want to trigger an event when a table's row is removeed
[06:07:15] <DevAntoine> -e
[06:08:41] <Omar-> DevAntoine I dont think you can find a cross-browser solution
[06:09:02] <Omar-> I once read such an event is in development phase
[06:09:40] <Omar-> or create your custom event upon removing a row
[06:09:42] <arschmitz> Omar-: DevAntoine: mutation observers
[06:09:58] <Omar-> arschmitz ready for production?
[06:10:15] <arschmitz> Omar-: depends what you support
[06:10:16] <DevAntoine> Omar-: oh yeah, I'll just fire a custom event :)
[06:10:23] <Omar-> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[06:10:46] <arschmitz> yup
[06:11:35] <Omar-> Feature	Chrome	Firefox (Gecko)	Internet Explorer	Opera	Safari
[06:11:36] <Omar-> Basic support	18 WebKit
[06:11:36] <Omar-> 26	14 (14)	11	15	6.0 WebKit
[06:11:39] <arschmitz> if you care about ie at all its basicly not an option but its been around for quite a while everywhere else
[06:11:44] <Omar-> what a mess
[06:11:47] <Omar-> sorry
[06:12:10] <Omar-> the page says IE 11 supports it
[06:12:19] <arschmitz> yes
[06:12:29] <arschmitz> but generally if you support ie its more then just 11
[06:12:44] <Omar-> yea maybe
[06:12:57] <Omar-> its good to know about it anyway
[06:13:00] <Omar-> thanks arschmitz
[06:13:07] <DevAntoine> yeah, I'll read it anyway, thanks
[06:13:31] <arschmitz> DevAntoine: Omar-: there are some polyfills out there but iv never used any of them.
[06:15:55] <Omar-> arschmitz does Android devices remove external page from DOM when naviagting to custom selectmenu (dialog)
[06:16:21] <arschmitz> all devices do removal the sam
[06:16:33] <arschmitz> and nothing is removed when going to a custom select
[06:17:07] <arschmitz> when the page the the custom select is on is removed the dialog for the select will also be removed
[06:17:08] <Omar-> it shouldn't be removed when navigating to a dialog page
[06:17:19] <Omar-> but looks like cordova has something to do
[06:17:20] <Omar-> http://stackoverflow.com/q/27712803/1771795
[06:17:36] <Omar-> DOM remains as is http://plnkr.co/edit/130gyA7RJUhUqZ7xaGAf?p=preview
[06:18:38] <Omar-> I meant when I navigate from form.html to custom-select dialog, form.html remains in DOM although it's an external page
[06:18:46] <Omar-> which is the correct behavior
[06:18:58] <arschmitz> it should remain
[06:19:04] <arschmitz> custom select will never remove a page
[06:19:05] <Omar-> but in that link, form page is removed
[06:19:07] <arschmitz> and it does remain
[06:19:19] <Omar-> yea I know
[06:19:21] <arschmitz> no its not that works fine?
[06:19:25] <Omar-> so could be a corova issue
[06:19:33] <Omar-> cordova*
[06:19:41] <arschmitz> will the person does not even have a test page
[06:19:50] <arschmitz> so its more likely an issue with their code
[06:20:52] <Omar-> I asked him to test code on a different platform
[06:21:11] <Omar-> to make sure its a cordova problem
[06:21:31] <Omar-> arschmitz btw, he uses MPM
[06:21:43] <Omar-> which is even weirder
[06:22:10] <Omar-> once he opens selectmenu, form gets reset, so I thought page is being removed from DOM
[06:22:36] <arschmitz> I have no idea if he thinks its a bug he should open an issue with a test case
[06:22:50] <arschmitz> we have team members from cordova that will look at it
[06:49:40] <pdcmoreira> guys, can i do var x = null; y.append(x) ?
[06:49:58] <pdcmoreira> does it throw an error or just ignore the x?
[07:07:29] <Mark_2> happy new year everybody!
[07:07:40] <elmo06060> I think my wordpress theme includes jscript, I use a lightbox plugin - if I add the latest google API for jscript to a plugin, my lightbox stops working....a conflict perhaps?
[07:07:56] <Mark_2> keep using old version?
[07:08:27] <elmo06060> I dont use the google API for old version, i didnt begin using it, it must of been automatically used with the lightbox plugin
[07:08:43] <elmo06060> should I be getting the folder path of the already used jscript and use that
[07:08:45] <elmo06060> for my new plugin?
[07:08:50] <Mark_2> i just downloaded few wordpressed theme
[07:08:57] <Mark_2> with my hacking tool.
[07:09:11] <Mark_2> the owners are depressed
[07:13:32] <nikio_> why doesnt this work guys? its he jquery datepicker widget
[07:13:34] <nikio_> http://jsfiddle.net/akzt1reb/
[07:17:14] <bacobart> you're using the wrong jquery lib i think
[07:17:33] <shoky> nikio_: the jsfiddle link to jquery ui is bad for that version of jquery.  works ok here http://jsfiddle.net/akzt1reb/1/
[07:17:56] <bacobart> http://jsfiddle.net/akzt1reb/2/
[07:17:57] <bacobart> hah
[07:18:02] <bacobart> too slow :P
[07:18:46] <nikio_> shoky and bacobart  both +10 for the right solution
[07:19:07] <nikio_> !plus bacobart, shoky
[07:19:24] <noober> hello.  is there a way to know if a function is triggered on a curtain event?
[07:20:33] <noober> this is my case --   $('#' + my_selector).on("keydown", function(e) { alert(do i exist?)
[07:21:49] <nikio_> bacobart, shoky http://jsfiddle.net/akzt1reb/4/ , note that i only took away the h2 line.. and look the datepicker gets ugly.. white gaps appear
[07:22:13] <noober> i am trying to bind events on a page in jquery that i am initiating but i cant because when i bind, the elements are not there yet
[07:22:18] <nikio_> compare it to this where the first line stays in
[07:22:19] <nikio_> http://jsfiddle.net/v19tsz3m/1/
[07:22:52] <nikio_> how can the lack of that line (<h1>jQuery datepicker skins</h1>)   cause white gaps to appear?
[07:23:15] <noober> so i tried using setInterval and runing the binding code until i know it is binded), so how can i know it is binded?
[07:23:45] <shoky> nikio_: what white gaps are you talking about?  it looks the same, just without the title..
[07:23:55] <bacobart> i see the whitegaps too
[07:24:03] <bacobart> idk why they're appearing
[07:24:07] <shoky> oh
[07:24:17] <shoky> i see now
[07:48:18] <nikio_> yeah : /
[07:48:23] <nikio_> argh
[07:54:26] <Cr0vaX> hi there
[07:55:09] <StanAccy> WHen debugging a page with jquery timed events on it, is there a way to freeze the page so that I can inspect the page state before a timer/animation completes?
[07:56:55] <nikio_> shoky, bacobart could it be because the h1 causes the body to believe something exists so it renders something, but without it doesnt, because the div is initially empy.. only ones the dom is loaded does the js load the datepicker
[07:58:57] <shoky> nikio_: seems like a chrome rendering bug to me, has to do with the margin after the header
[08:03:45] <shoky> nikio_: the white color itself comes from the "background: #eee" in your css, btw
[08:22:28] <Cr0vaX> http://jsfiddle.net/1agarfch/3/ I'm trying to submit JSON.stringify($row) of bootstrap-table using AJAX, but when I do it it says parseerror, any clue? (sorry the button Opções doesn't show the options)
[08:23:48] <Uhkis> Cr0vaX: missing jquery
[08:24:18] <robertmaxrees> Cr0vaX asl, try to console.log($row); right before that and share that data here.
[08:24:26] <robertmaxrees> *also
[08:24:33] <Cr0vaX> ok, will try, ty
[08:28:49] <_DB> sup guys
[08:29:48] <_DB> how can I run a .each on a array like this [Object, Object] 0: Object , item: 1 , name: "Standard Beacon" , qty: 40
[08:31:01] <robertmaxrees> wut
[08:31:38] <robertmaxrees> share an actual example.
[08:32:18] <_DB> im trying to run a .each for a array  thats formatted  0: Object [ item: 1 , name: "Standard Beacon" , qty: 40]
[08:32:25] <robertmaxrees> that's a strange array.
[08:32:27] <robertmaxrees> and not valid.
[08:32:42] <_DB> well its coming from my session data
[08:32:49] <_DB> taht iset up for a shopping cart
[08:32:50] <robertmaxrees> paste a copy of your data in a fiddle.
[08:32:54] <robertmaxrees> because that's not a valid js array
[08:33:14] <_DB> what data?
[08:33:21] <_DB> the incoming data from the request?
[08:33:26] <robertmaxrees> 0: Object [ item: 1 , name: "Standard Beacon" , qty: 40]
[08:33:43] <robertmaxrees> that's not a valid thing in js.
[08:33:50] <_rgn> looks lik you're console.logging arguments
[08:33:55] <robertmaxrees> ^
[08:34:02] <_DB> it is
[08:34:05] <_DB> lol
[08:34:32] <_DB> how can I get what the array actually looks like?
[08:34:39] <robertmaxrees> console.log(JSON.stringify(theObject))
[08:34:46] <robertmaxrees> replace theObject with whatever you've got.
[08:35:23] <_DB> [{"item":1,"qty":40,"name":"Standard Beacon"},{"item":2,"qty":50,"name":"Beacon+"}]
[08:35:32] <robertmaxrees> so that's an array of objects.
[08:35:47] <_DB> yeah
[08:35:57] <robertmaxrees> okay - and what do you want to do with it?
[08:36:30] <_DB> well I want to grab each qty and add it to a variable
[08:36:38] <_DB> so I figured id have to iterate through it
[08:37:03] <robertmaxrees> nah.  use the native .map()
[08:37:25] <robertmaxrees> well, there are a few different ways to do it.
[08:38:04] <_DB> yeah I know
[08:38:08] <_DB> I could use a for
[08:38:15] <_DB> or .each
[08:38:17] <robertmaxrees> don't use a jquery method to do it, either way.
[08:38:45] <_DB> perhaps I should just send over the total I want in the request ?
[08:38:52] <_DB> and save myself trouble
[08:39:58] <robertmaxrees> or use a .reduce.
[08:40:02] <robertmaxrees> tons of easy ways to do it :)
[08:40:34] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qm8bb4dv/1/
[08:43:17] * PenguinMan98 appears
[08:46:45] <_DB> robertmaxrees just wondering does reduce only work when there are only 2 object in that array?
[08:46:50] <_DB> because I currently have 3
[08:48:08] <robertmaxrees> Did You Try?™
[08:48:09] <kegster> i have an html textbox type number, and i have a max value, but that max value set is overridden when the user types in the number. so, how can i restrict to the spinner only?
[08:48:50] <_DB> yeah I got NAN
[08:50:47] <robertmaxrees> sec
[08:51:30] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qm8bb4dv/2/
[08:51:47] <robertmaxrees> you can do it in one fell swoop with reduce, but i'm lazy and can't remember how,
[08:52:07] <robertmaxrees> oh and those are IE9 and above only btw.
[09:06:15] <PenguinMan98> kegster: $('input field').on('input', function(){ if( this.value < $(this).attr('max') ) this.value = $(this).attr('max') });
[09:06:44] <PenguinMan98> perhaps?
[09:07:01] <PenguinMan98> oh, make that a >
[09:08:00] <kegster> i did onkeydown return true ;)
[09:08:07] <kegster> worked fine. :D
[09:08:15] <robertmaxrees> don't return for cases like that.
[09:08:26] <robertmaxrees> explicitly prevent the default or whatever.
[09:09:05] <_DB> ok
[09:09:26] <PenguinMan98> $('input field').on('input', function(){ this.value = (this.value > $(this).attr('max')) ? $(this).attr('max') : this.value.parseInt() });
[09:09:44] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you use parseInt
[09:09:46] <PenguinMan98> perhaps?
[09:09:56] <robertmaxrees> parseInt(this.value, 10)
[09:09:58] <PenguinMan98> derp. I'm not looking at docs again
[09:10:11] <robertmaxrees> and might want to use .prop() instead of .attr()
[09:10:23] <PenguinMan98> What's the difference?
[09:10:38] <_DB> robertmaxrees cool it works thanks bud
[09:10:48] <robertmaxrees> object properties vs markup attributes.
[09:11:01] <PenguinMan98> I don't get it
[09:11:02] <robertmaxrees> one sec, let me show you.
[09:11:05] <PenguinMan98> ok
[09:11:19] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1ckeh195/
[09:12:56] <xinming> Just question on juqery-ui, If we want to define site link and reuse all the color from jquery-ui, How do we code the css class please?
[09:13:17] <xinming> will class with ui-state-default automatically handle the ui-state-hover when we hover the mouse on the link?
[09:13:34] <xinming> Or, what is the better way to achieve that? I mean reuse the existing jquery theme
[09:13:39] <xinming> for text links
[09:15:23] <kegster> robertmaxrees, did you mean that for me?
[09:15:25] <kegster> no return
[09:16:05] <PenguinMan98> robertmaxrees:  I look at your demo and am more convinced I wanted .attr(
[09:16:50] <robertmaxrees> for PenguinMan98
[09:17:01] <robertmaxrees> and i still suggest .prop(), but ok.
[09:17:33] <robertmaxrees> put another way, you're already doing this.value ;)
[09:18:34] <PenguinMan98> But thanks, now I understand the difference
[09:18:58] <robertmaxrees> access objects, not markup.  that's the way I look at it.
[09:21:04] <PenguinMan98> ( I think)
[09:21:26] <xinming> Anyone here would clarify my confusion please?
[09:21:50] <xinming> will class with ui-state-default automatically handle the ui-state-hover when we hover the mouse on the link? Or, I have to write js myself to handle all these ?
[09:21:51] <robertmaxrees> xinming you want to know how to reuse jquery ui styles?
[09:22:03] <robertmaxrees> xinming have you tried?
[09:22:24] <PenguinMan98> IIUC: The attr( gets its value from what was present in the DOM at page load.  But the browser creates an internal object to represent that input field and that's what prop( looks at.  When I change the input, it changes that object but not the DOM which is why .prop( changes to the new value but .attr( does not.
[09:23:03] <PenguinMan98> do I get it?
[09:23:16] <robertmaxrees> PenguinMan98 basically.  when you access/edit properties on DOM nodes, you just access them like properties on other objects.
[09:24:38] <PenguinMan98> kegster: yeah, I think he meant you
[09:25:03] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah that was for you kegster
[09:29:20] <Sal> hi
[09:31:08] <Sal> does anyone know a plugin or other js lib that can let me swipe/drag a centered <div> if on smaller screen size it goes out of right screen edge?
[09:31:12] <xinming> robertmaxrees: Yes, I want to reuse the ui styles in my pages.
[09:31:21] <Sal> i saw a lot of sliders or carousels...
[09:31:34] <Sal> but they all work with more than 1 panel/child/item
[09:31:38] <xinming> robertmaxrees: and I tried. I was thinking what is the best practise to re-use the ui from jquery. eg, bg-color font-color etc...
[09:32:21] <Sal> all i need is to be able to swipe or drag element to the left if on smaller screens it falls out on right side
[09:33:06] <Sal> i itred doing it manually using hammer.js, but i got problems vecause of the div centered on normal size screens
[09:33:18] <Sal> itred=tried
[09:34:10] <xinming> I read the doc here,  http://api.jqueryui.com/theming/css-framework/   And after my test, It worked when I add classes according to jquery-ui naming. It worked, But I don't know how to do it with best practise.
[09:37:41] <nikio_> shoky did u try to fix it
[09:37:41] <nikio_> ?
[09:40:23] <PenguinMan98> kegster: http://jsfiddle.net/kh1avg6p/1/
[10:06:20] <jeffreylevesque> is there a nice open source graphing utility? I prefer a set of nice API, where my application can generically create a two, or three dimensional graph, rather than use a GUI interface
[10:06:37] <tw2113> d3.js does graphing
[10:08:26] <jeffreylevesque> I'm considering using https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib
[10:08:41] <jeffreylevesque> but, wasn't sure if there was a better equivalent, that jquery could do instead
[10:10:16] <jeffreylevesque> i was even looking into other languages, like C++. Seems matplotlib is more heavily contributed.  I also was looking into d3.js
[10:10:37] <jeffreylevesque> it seems matplotlib and d3.js seem like good choices?
[10:11:05] <tw2113> matplotlib looks to be python, d3 is javascript
[10:11:14] <robertmaxrees> kidn of depends on your needs.
[10:16:50] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: would be cool to be js/jquery - since that would decrease server load
[10:17:02] <jeffreylevesque> but, would be cool to keep logic on the backend
[10:28:51] <shoky> nikio_: yeah, didn't find a good way really.. you can make it less ugly by changing that #eee background to fit that gradient
[10:29:44] <nikio_> shoky i used it on my website which was dark
[10:29:48] <nikio_> but the gaps were white
[10:29:55] <nikio_> but i found a better datepicker with timepicker too
[10:30:00] <nikio_> http://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/
[12:01:52] <PenguinMan98> There
[12:01:55] <PenguinMan98> Finished
[12:02:58] <PenguinMan98> I started from a simple bootstrap pagination utility and wrote the solution myself.
[12:03:03] <PenguinMan98> Screw DataTables
[12:05:11] <PenguinMan98> I started with this: http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/example-widget-bootstrap-theme.html
[12:05:33] <PenguinMan98> It wasn't quite 'ripe'
[12:05:48] <PenguinMan98> but I was able to fix most of that pretty quick.  Then extend it for date filtering
[12:06:54] * PenguinMan98 pats himself on the back.  Should probably put this solution up somewhere to get my name out there.
[12:07:14] <SomeT> hi
[12:07:21] <SomeT> can anyone help me with some jquery code?
[12:07:29] <PenguinMan98> That's what we do. What's up?
[12:07:41] <SomeT> http://jsfiddle.net/SomeT/AX35A/35/
[12:07:52] <SomeT> I am trying to change the text value of the buttons to a colour instead
[12:08:03] <SomeT> I only just started learning :)
[12:08:17] <SomeT> I think my code is a mess
[12:10:09] <tw2113> everyone thinks their own code is a mess
[12:10:36] <SomeT> I think I might be going the wrong way about this with JQx buttons
[12:10:49] <PenguinMan98> Not me. I think my code is beautiful. It just doesn't work.
[12:10:51] <SomeT> because I have created a circular button on top, perhaps compatibility here is my issue
[12:12:23] <robertmaxrees> SomeT $("#jqxButton")[0].value = template: "danger"; that doesn't make any sense.
[12:12:30] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting template: "danger"; to do.
[12:12:52] <SomeT> to change it to red
[12:12:58] <SomeT> I was reading on the jqxbutton site
[12:13:08] <PenguinMan98> http://jsfiddle.net/AX35A/43/
[12:13:16] <PenguinMan98> I cleaned it up a little
[12:13:21] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/AX35A/44/
[12:13:34] <PenguinMan98> So, to turn it red, perhaps you want to give it a class?
[12:13:52] <SomeT> class = button?
[12:14:00] <SomeT> sorry I am beginner, could you please elaborate
[12:14:07] <robertmaxrees> you can add another class.
[12:14:14] <robertmaxrees> .addClass();
[12:14:36] <PenguinMan98> In the html you can style buttons using class="someclass1 someclassb etc"
[12:14:45] <robertmaxrees> "text value to a color instead" is where we're probably getting tripped up.
[12:14:54] <robertmaxrees> could you clarify what you mean?
[12:14:59] <PenguinMan98> Using jQuery, you can add and remove those classes to change how the style appears
[12:15:23] <SomeT> yes I want to replace the text completly with a colour instead
[12:15:37] <SomeT> I do not want any text on the button
[12:15:41] <robertmaxrees> so you'd do .text('') to clear text.
[12:15:41] <PenguinMan98> So if your css had a .danger{ background-color: red;}
[12:15:55] <robertmaxrees> then use .addClass() to add a class that changes the color.
[12:16:03] <PenguinMan98> Then instead of changing the .val(), you change the .addClass( 'danger' );
[12:16:09] <SomeT> makes sense
[12:16:17] <SomeT> just where does that go into the Jquery code, lol
[12:16:22] <SomeT> sorry I ask stupid question
[12:16:29] <PenguinMan98> Add this to the css
[12:16:30] <PenguinMan98> .danger{ background-color: red;}
[12:16:31] <robertmaxrees> your conditional.
[12:17:02] <PenguinMan98> Then replace the .val( 'danger' ) with .addClass( 'danger' );
[12:17:14] <robertmaxrees> he still needs the .val('').
[12:17:29] <PenguinMan98> .val('').addClass('danger');
[12:17:37] <robertmaxrees> swap those
[12:17:41] <robertmaxrees> .val() returns a string.
[12:17:56] <PenguinMan98> ah
[12:17:59] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/AX35A/49/
[12:18:01] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[12:18:29] <PenguinMan98> beautiful
[12:18:59] <robertmaxrees> even better - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/AX35A/53/
[12:19:28] <SomeT> ok before looking at thos
[12:19:37] <SomeT> and to give an idea of what I am trying to do in more detail
[12:19:38] <SomeT> http://jsfiddle.net/SomeT/AX35A/52/
[12:19:39] <SomeT> I done that
[12:19:45] <SomeT> I am trying to toggle between green and red
[12:19:50] <SomeT> I believe it should work
[12:19:53] <SomeT> but its not :'(
[12:20:05] <robertmaxrees> you need to .removeClass() as well.
[12:20:23] <SomeT> so just add that in after else right?
[12:20:30] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:20:33] <robertmaxrees> for each conditional.
[12:20:34] <PenguinMan98> http://jsfiddle.net/AX35A/54/
[12:20:41] <PenguinMan98> like so
[12:20:53] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/AX35A/55/
[12:21:00] <robertmaxrees> don't keep selecting things if you can avoid it.
[12:21:16] <SomeT> makes sense
[12:21:23] <SomeT> its like I have to toggle it within each section
[12:21:26] <SomeT> I need more sleep
[12:21:45] <PenguinMan98> Once you give the element a class, it has it until you remove it
[12:21:54] <SomeT> thanks so much all!
[12:22:01] <SomeT> happy new year as well I guess
[12:22:05] <PenguinMan98> np.  You too!
[12:22:22] <SomeT> I am trying to build this as a feature of a social network I am building, I know a bit about other stuff
[12:22:30] <SomeT> but this is the first time I have ever used jquery
[12:22:33] <SomeT> its not hard
[12:22:37] <SomeT> just gets a tad confusing
[12:22:53] <PenguinMan98> Best of luck to ya
[12:23:46] <SomeT> thanks!
[12:24:17] <SomeT> does anyone know how you save stuff on jsfiddle?
[12:24:24] <SomeT> I try ctrl s but it saves whole sit
[12:24:27] <SomeT> I am signed up
[12:24:36] <robertmaxrees> the save button
[12:24:41] <robertmaxrees> don't need to be signed up.
[12:25:03] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/9HasVcJ.png
[12:25:34] <SomeT> I dont have that button
[12:25:44] <robertmaxrees> lolwut
[12:25:45] <robertmaxrees> you should.
[12:25:52] <PenguinMan98> use the 'update' button
[12:25:53] <SomeT> I have update instead
[12:25:56] <robertmaxrees> oh, "update"
[12:25:58] <robertmaxrees> yeah - use that.
[12:25:59] <robertmaxrees> same thing.
[12:26:02] <PenguinMan98> lol
[12:26:07] <robertmaxrees> well, sorta the same thing ;)
[12:26:15] <SomeT> thanks again!
[12:26:20] <PenguinMan98> save when you're making a new one
[12:26:22] <PenguinMan98> update after that
[12:28:00] <SomeT> its just when I goto: http://jsfiddle.net/user/dashboard/
[12:28:07] <SomeT> its says: You don't have any fidddles yet
[12:28:58] <PenguinMan98> Are you a guest? Or did you sign up?
[12:29:02] <SomeT> signed up
[12:29:05] <SomeT> its weird
[12:29:15] <PenguinMan98> But the fiddle you created before, you made as a guest?
[12:29:57] <SomeT> I think so actually
[12:30:08] <SomeT> I am best just creating a new fiddle
[12:30:30] <PenguinMan98> copy pasta
[12:31:04] <SomeT> thanks
[12:38:11] <robertmaxrees> scala is breaking my brain a little.
[12:39:53] <SomeT> what is scala based on?
[12:40:51] <SomeT> no wonder its hurting your brain, lol
[12:40:52] <SomeT> Influenced by
[12:40:52] <SomeT> Eiffel, Erlang, Haskell,[3] Java, Lisp,[4] Pizza,[5] Standard ML, OCaml, Scheme, Smalltalk, Oz
[12:41:06] <SomeT> I noticed Lisp in there though, seems a strange choice
[12:41:18] <SomeT> I always see that as the american version of Prolog
[12:41:32] <robertmaxrees> lisp/scheme are pretty influential.
[12:41:34] <robertmaxrees> haskell, too.
[12:42:27] <SomeT> I have only really used Prolog
[12:42:32] <SomeT> and not even that much
[12:42:45] <SomeT> Lisp is also quite challenging to get running properly in Windows I have found
[12:42:55] <robertmaxrees> which one?
[12:43:30] <robertmaxrees> 'cause there are like 4 dialiects these days.
[12:44:11] <robertmaxrees> Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, and one other i can't remember.
[12:44:22] <robertmaxrees> clojure is easy to get running since that's on the JVM
[12:44:25] <SomeT> I think I tried one called LispStick
[12:44:33] <SomeT> can't remember whixh one  it was based on
[12:44:53] <SomeT> http://www.iqool.de/lispstick.html
[12:45:13] <robertmaxrees> Common Lisp.
[12:45:15] <SomeT> I actually hate doing all my coding/programming in windows
[12:45:25] <robertmaxrees> I like it just fine personally.
[12:45:25] <SomeT> I am only doing it because my university requires it
[12:45:30] <SomeT> and the laptop was free
[12:45:46] <SomeT> maybe my knowledge is not enough yet, also I have a short temper
[12:45:52] <SomeT> I give up to easily
[12:46:04] <robertmaxrees> how long have you been coding?
[12:46:08] <SomeT> erm
[12:46:22] <SomeT> its a difficult questin to answer
[12:46:43] <SomeT> I would say I am a false beginner who has been coding on and off inbetween uni work for about a year
[12:47:01] <SomeT> I think I have only just got HTML 5 and a bit of Python down, but its better than nothing
[12:47:14] <SomeT> I have messed around with a few other languages as well
[12:47:29] <robertmaxrees> so still pretty fresh
[12:47:42] <SomeT> yep
[12:47:54] <SomeT> I hate it, but I need the university degree
[12:48:00] <SomeT> it gets in the way a lot
[12:48:12] <robertmaxrees> i didn't need the degree and i'm doing fine
[12:48:13] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:48:21] <SomeT> its computer science as well, next year we are studying Java and programming in more detail
[12:48:33] <SomeT> so I am looking forward to a whole year of being unemployed and doing pure programming
[12:48:40] <SomeT> which country you from?
[12:48:43] <robertmaxrees> US
[12:49:01] <SomeT> UK
[12:49:11] <Robdgreat> pluto
[12:49:12] <robertmaxrees> dunno anything about the environment over there.
[12:49:17] <SomeT> you have more oppurtunity for tech in that country trust me, haha
[12:49:30] <SomeT> I have been going to Berlin for the past few years for networking my city is so dead
[12:49:49] <SomeT> but the startup/tech scene as only just started to get going in the past year or so
[12:50:18] <SomeT> and now I feel like a false beginner german british hybrid trying to make my way in a weird rare job based industry
[12:50:38] <robertmaxrees> i'd get out of that "false beginner" mindset.
[12:50:40] <robertmaxrees> you're just learning.
[12:50:59] <SomeT> I stopped for 13 years or so
[12:51:10] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[12:51:14] <robertmaxrees> just a bit of a gap to work with :)
[12:51:33] <SomeT> but I agree, I try not to classify myself and just get on with it
[12:51:47] <SomeT> a gap, more like a grand canyon ;)
[12:51:56] <robertmaxrees> hah
[12:52:02] <SomeT> last thing I coded was visual basic
[12:52:06] <SomeT> 13 years ago
[12:52:27] <SomeT> I tried to find somewhere where I could pick up where I left off, closest I got was pure basic which helped a bit
[12:52:28] <Robdgreat> programming hasn't changed that much, if languages have
[12:52:37] <robertmaxrees> ^ this
[12:52:45] * Robdgreat the Insightful
[12:52:50] <robertmaxrees> we've just made things a little easier in some ways.
[12:52:52] <SomeT> yeah I agree, tthing I like the most I feel like computers definitly work a lot better than they used to , haha
[12:52:54] <Robdgreat> I'm here all week, folks
[12:52:55] <SomeT> exactluy
[12:57:11] <SomeT> whats the best version of jquery to use for my site?
[12:57:15] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[12:57:20] <robertmaxrees> what browsers do you need to support?
[12:57:24] <SomeT> all of them
[12:57:30] <robertmaxrees> then the latest 1.x
[12:57:35] <robertmaxrees> 1.12.1 i think it is.
[12:57:47] <SomeT> 1.11.2?
[12:57:49] <robertmaxrees> 1.11.2 actually.
[12:57:54] <SomeT> ok thanks
[12:57:59] <robertmaxrees> same features as 2.1.3, just different browser support.
[12:58:08] <robertmaxrees> version 3 is bringing sanity to the naming convention.
[12:58:54] <tw2113> SomeT, are you already supporting the reported browser that Microsoft is shipping with Windows 10?
[12:59:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:01:44] <SomeT> no
[13:01:52] <SomeT> http://jsfiddle.net/SomeT/1qojj3Lv/5/
[13:01:59] <SomeT> my code no longer works when I save it
[13:02:03] <SomeT> can't see why its going wrong
[13:02:09] <robertmaxrees> open up your console
[13:02:48] <SomeT> it mimics this one perfectly: http://jsfiddle.net/SomeT/AX35A/69/
[13:03:05] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[13:03:41] <SomeT> in jsfiddle?
[13:03:44] <SomeT> I don't have console
[13:03:48] <robertmaxrees> your browser console.
[13:03:54] <robertmaxrees> hit f12 on your keyboard.
[13:04:02] <robertmaxrees> that'll open your dev tools.
[13:04:05] <robertmaxrees> click "console"
[13:04:15] <SomeT> ah sorry
[13:04:25] <SomeT> ok done
[13:04:31] <robertmaxrees> see the issue?

[13:05:52] <robertmaxrees> also, check out my latest fiddle.
[13:06:27] <SomeT> ok
[13:06:28] <SomeT> thanks
[13:07:54] <SomeT> works now
[13:13:45] <SomeT> I have been thinking about doing a login system in jquery
[13:13:51] <SomeT> but I think I am better of sticking to php?
[13:14:05] <SomeT> I can't see any benefit of juery in this respect
[13:15:04] <robertmaxrees> you wouldn't be able to anyway
[13:15:25] <SomeT> good
[13:20:14] <SomeT> do I use compressed jquery or uncompressed for use on my site?
[13:21:23] <robertmaxrees> compressed on live
[13:21:38] <SomeT> on live?
[13:21:41] <SomeT> whats that?
[13:22:13] <robertmaxrees> your live site.
[13:22:38] <SomeT> ah sorry
[13:22:39] <SomeT> tired
[13:22:40] <SomeT> lol
[13:22:58] <SomeT> is it possible to embed jquery into a php page?
[13:23:29] <robertmaxrees> you use a script tag for that.
[13:23:46] <SomeT> thanks
[13:23:49] <SomeT> I just googled
[13:23:52] <SomeT> dont know why I asked here
[13:23:58] <SomeT> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5669018/how-to-use-jquery-and-php
[13:24:23] <robertmaxrees> don't generate javasript with php btw
[13:25:03] <SomeT> why?
[13:25:12] <robertmaxrees> separations of concern.
[13:25:16] <robertmaxrees> and you don't need to.
[13:25:17] <SomeT> if my login system were to use php though
[13:25:21] <SomeT> how do I get around that
[13:25:21] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter.
[13:25:43] <robertmaxrees> what's a case where you think you'd need to generate javascript code?
[13:25:53] <SomeT> quite a lot
[13:25:54] <SomeT> I reckon
[13:26:04] <SomeT> only using php for the frame as it would be
[13:26:06] <robertmaxrees> rarely if ever
[13:26:12] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:26:17] <SomeT> I am confused
[13:26:25] <robertmaxrees> why would youneed to generate javascript code with PHP?
[13:26:50] <SomeT> when your saying javascript do you mean jquery as well?
[13:27:00] <robertmaxrees> jquery IS javascript.
[13:27:12] <SomeT> exactly
[13:27:15] <robertmaxrees> by "generate" i mean "dynamically write".
[13:27:27] <SomeT> ok but I am confused, logically speaking I create a login system
[13:27:29] <robertmaxrees> as in, you would never use php to dynamically write javascript.
[13:27:29] <SomeT> then on the user page
[13:27:38] <SomeT> it displays something in jquery
[13:27:49] <SomeT> so I need to display such user pages on html?
[13:27:55] <robertmaxrees> the js can be "static" so to speak.
[13:28:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah you should write out with html.
[13:28:10] <SomeT> it will still be as secure I suppose
[13:28:15] <SomeT> I think?
[13:28:15] <robertmaxrees> err.
[13:28:15] <SomeT> lol
[13:28:25] <robertmaxrees> how would you write out the page otherwise?
[13:28:42] <robertmaxrees> PHP generates output - commonly that output is HTML.
[13:28:42] <SomeT> I dont understand your question
[13:28:52] <SomeT> yes I was going to say something similar to that
[13:28:58] <SomeT> a php page is similar to an html page anyway
[13:29:05] <robertmaxrees> it outputs HTML anyway :)
[13:29:07] <SomeT> so I could have a body for php and html in the same page?
[13:30:02] <SomeT> then put the jquery script within the html body
[13:30:44] <SomeT> ?
[13:31:01] <robertmaxrees> link the script uising a script tag.
[13:31:05] <robertmaxrees> just like you did jquery.
[13:31:27] <robertmaxrees> your PHP and your JS should basically know nothing about one another.
[13:31:41] <SomeT> I show you what I do in a moment
[13:31:48] <SomeT> or 30 mins
[13:32:19] <robertmaxrees> lol it's a language agnostic concept either way.
[13:33:24] <SomeT> I think I get you
[13:33:35] <SomeT> but tbh first time I have tried combining so many languages in one page
[13:35:09] <robertmaxrees> just focus on having your php generate valid html.
[13:35:22] <SomeT> not following you
[13:36:22] <SomeT> http://pastebin.com/FsJX338k
[13:36:25] <robertmaxrees> PHP generates output - generally used for text.
[13:36:27] <robertmaxrees> *html
[13:36:38] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:36:39] <robertmaxrees> example
[13:36:41] <SomeT> then add <script> tags for the jquery code within the html
[13:36:42] <robertmaxrees> *exactly.
[13:36:52] <SomeT> NOT the php
[13:36:58] <robertmaxrees> in the head or just before </body>, yeah
[13:37:05] <SomeT> exactly yeah
[13:37:10] <SomeT> but php falls within body?
[13:37:12] <SomeT> is that right
[13:37:21] <robertmaxrees> i don't knwo anything about PHP
[13:37:27] <robertmaxrees> all I know is PHP outputs stuff.
[13:38:01] <robertmaxrees> the resultant html doesn't know anything about the PHP though.
[13:38:06] <SomeT> exactly
[13:45:19] <SomeT> does anyone know if there is a way of doing this without jqxbutton?
[13:45:24] <SomeT> for example using pure css button
[13:45:29] <SomeT> or does that make it to complex?
[13:45:33] <robertmaxrees> do what?
[13:45:50] <SomeT> ok so at the moment I have
[13:45:51] <SomeT>   $("#jqxButton").addClass("green");
[13:45:51] <SomeT>         $("#jqxButton").removeClass("red");
[13:45:55] <robertmaxrees> woah
[13:45:58] <robertmaxrees> don't paste into the channel.
[13:46:03] <SomeT> oops
[13:46:04] <SomeT> sorry
[13:46:08] <robertmaxrees> and why do you keep ignoring the changes I made?
[13:46:15] <SomeT> what changes?
[13:46:21] <SomeT> where?
[13:46:28] <SomeT> this is the first time I have used jsfiddle
[13:46:38] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1qojj3Lv/6/
[13:46:47] <robertmaxrees> I kept linking you to these changes.
[13:47:07] <SomeT> sorry about that
[13:47:41] <robertmaxrees> that's off the one with the broken lib links.
[13:47:46] <SomeT> ahh so I see you have put this.addclass?
[13:47:56] <robertmaxrees> also var $jqxButton = $('#jqxButton');
[13:48:05] <robertmaxrees> what is jqxbutton giving you?
[13:48:20] <SomeT> well it was initially to help me with the styling of the button
[13:48:28] <SomeT> but I don't think I need those aspects really
[13:48:35] <SomeT> just struggling to get my head round the html
[13:48:49] <robertmaxrees> all depends on what you want the button to look like and do.
[13:49:25] <SomeT> exactly how it does now
[13:49:45] <SomeT> I knoww you can do it in css like so: http://jsfiddle.net/josedvq/Jyjjx/45/
[13:49:57] <robertmaxrees> then do it that way.
[13:49:59] <SomeT> however get a bit confused that if you want it to toggle rather than linking
[13:50:03] <SomeT> it does not work so well
[13:50:08] <SomeT> or at all
[13:50:09] <robertmaxrees> easy.
[13:50:19] <robertmaxrees> that's where the js comes in.
[13:50:53] <SomeT> lost again now
[13:51:18] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/josedvq/Jyjjx/45/ - when you click, what do you want to have happen?
[13:51:43] <SomeT> for the circle to interchange between red and green
[13:51:46] <SomeT> upon each click
[13:51:51] <SomeT> so you click once it changes red
[13:51:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you can use javascript to control that part.
[13:52:15] <SomeT> but I already have that with my jquery script just dont wanna use the jqxButton
[13:52:25] <SomeT> as its commercial I can't afford it
[13:52:32] <robertmaxrees> then use the other example.
[13:52:46] <SomeT> what the css round button?
[13:52:50] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/josedvq/Jyjjx/45/
[13:52:53] <robertmaxrees> yes
[13:53:13] <SomeT> I have no idea how
[13:53:21] <robertmaxrees> let me show you :)
[13:53:26] <SomeT> thats how I ended up using jquery
[13:53:29] <SomeT> because it was easier
[13:53:40] <robertmaxrees> you use javascript and css for that part.
[13:53:43] <robertmaxrees> let me show you.
[13:53:44] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[13:53:50] <SomeT> thanks!
[13:55:32] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Jyjjx/2349/
[13:55:53] <robertmaxrees> oh wait.
[13:56:21] <robertmaxrees> eh, close enough.
[13:56:23] <robertmaxrees> you get the idea.
[13:56:25] <robertmaxrees> not perfect.
[13:56:49] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Jyjjx/2350/ this is closer to what you want.
[13:56:59] <SomeT> thanks
[13:57:12] <SomeT> yeah pretty much perfecty
[13:57:29] <SomeT> the critical thing thats bugging me though why javascript and not jquery to achieve that
[13:57:37] <robertmaxrees> jquery IS javascript.
[13:57:46] <robertmaxrees> if you're writing jquery, you're writing javascript.
[13:58:30] <Tawre> robertmaxrees, isn't there a gem for jquery for rails?
[13:58:35] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:58:46] <robertmaxrees> you might be thinking about the asset pipeline thing.
[13:59:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah, those are just to simplify including jquery in your project.
[14:00:06] <SomeT> ah makes sense
[14:00:07] <SomeT> thanks
[14:30:08] <Tawre> happy new year Cork
[14:30:16] <Tawre> thank you for your awesome help
[14:38:01] <SomeT> I am off
[14:38:02] <SomeT> cya
[15:28:26] <Jattenalle> happy new years
[15:38:29] <robertmaxrees> so quiet today
[16:12:30] <asarch> http://convos.by/
[16:12:45] <asarch> This jQuery app seems to be broken
[16:12:53] <asarch> (Buttons are not actually working)
[16:13:50] <robertmaxrees> okay
[16:13:55] <robertmaxrees> (that's not a "jquery app" btw)
[16:14:12] <asarch> Oh
[16:14:22] <asarch> Ok
[16:14:29] <robertmaxrees> that's a full-stack client/server setup.
[16:14:55] <robertmaxrees> submit an issue at their repo if you want to let them know something is busted.
[16:15:11] <asarch> Ok
[16:15:23] <asarch> Thank you
[16:15:27] <robertmaxrees> sure
[16:15:29] <asarch> Thank you very much :-)
[16:16:19] <bl4ckdu5t> I have this line of code $('[id^="edit_department"').on("ajax:success", (e, data, status, xhr) ->
[16:16:26] <bl4ckdu5t> it's a coffescript
[16:16:44] <robertmaxrees> i can sort of tell what that's trying to do.
[16:16:59] <bl4ckdu5t> works well on chrome but then I discovered my firefox console complained that unrecongnized expression
[16:17:09] <bl4ckdu5t> Syntnax error
[16:17:14] <robertmaxrees> coffeescript doesn't run natively in browsers.
[16:17:19] <bl4ckdu5t> *Syntax
[16:17:19] <robertmaxrees> need to compile it to javascript first.
[16:17:27] <bl4ckdu5t> It's compiled
[16:17:38] <robertmaxrees> then what does the compiled code look like?
[16:17:41] <bl4ckdu5t> so it's complaining about the selector
[16:18:16] <robertmaxrees> ah i see it now.
[16:18:25] <bl4ckdu5t> return $('[id^="edit_department"').on("ajax:success", function(e, data, status, xhr) {
[16:18:33] <robertmaxrees> you didn't close it.
[16:18:36] <robertmaxrees> $('[id^="edit_department"]')
[16:19:01] <bl4ckdu5t> and chrome ignored this
[16:19:19] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) probably a sizzle issue.
[16:20:06] <bl4ckdu5t> it's been fine on chrome
[16:20:20] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't really mean much.
[16:20:23] <bl4ckdu5t> Thanks anyway. FF is now cool with it
[16:20:34] <robertmaxrees> chrome is generally pretty bad about compliance.
[16:20:47] <robertmaxrees> also - i'd give those elements all a class and select on that instead.
[16:21:52] <bl4ckdu5t> it was a loop. Rails convention. It adds the id to input elements automatically
[16:22:08] <bl4ckdu5t> I prevent ids when I can because of the level of specificity
[16:22:26] <robertmaxrees> partial attribute selectors like that are slow - that's why i'd avoid it.
[16:22:32] <bl4ckdu5t> so each input was like edit-input-1
[16:23:46] <bl4ckdu5t> A lot of classes starts making code lose sexiness
[16:23:58] <robertmaxrees> just need one class in this case.
[16:24:04] <robertmaxrees> and don't go for sexy code, go for good code.
[16:25:06] <bl4ckdu5t> I think a sexy code == good code
[16:25:58] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:26:15] <robertmaxrees> "good code" uses the tools, and uses them well.
[16:26:27] <robertmaxrees> partial attribute selectors are bad.
[16:27:33] <bl4ckdu5t> I will google to get more conviction and re-adjust
[16:27:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:28:00] <robertmaxrees> or just use classes for what they're meant to do and keep things easy (shrug)
[16:31:02] <bl4ckdu5t> I'll try to
[16:35:03] <asarch> http://img.ctrlv.in/img/15/01/01/54a4961f515a5.png
[16:35:54] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[16:36:28] <robertmaxrees> asarch that's something for the maintainers of the repo to figure out and fix.
[16:37:21] <bl4ckdu5t> asarch: you IRC from the web?
[16:38:03] <robertmaxrees> they're trying to get some kind of full-stack system running.
[16:52:15] <asarch> It's a local web server for an IRC session bl4ckdu5t
[16:52:24] <asarch> Yeah, I already report it
[16:52:46] <asarch> ...robertmaxrees
[16:52:50] <asarch> :-)
[17:03:40] <enigmabomb> Im having a problem where my code isnt being executed, but I have no errors. Nothign works, not even console.log
[17:03:46] <enigmabomb> How do I trouble shoot something with no error messages?
[17:03:51] <enigmabomb> Jquery is being included
[17:06:55] <shoky> you can show us..
[17:14:05] <robertmaxrees> 5 bucks says your console is foltering.
[17:14:07] <robertmaxrees> *filtering
[17:22:38] <lampd1> heya! are there better ways to do this? https://gist.github.com/reidblomquist/797dee5c18d437b43005
[17:26:10] <robertmaxrees> which part?
[17:27:09] <lampd1> well, i was thinking there'd be a better way to observe it
[17:27:15] <lampd1> but looking at it now im not sure it could be much better
[17:27:35] <lampd1> (i.e. having a conditional check outside of the scroll event listener)
[17:27:37] <robertmaxrees> there are some minor changes you could make that'd make it better
[17:28:04] <lampd1> mind making a revision so i could see?
[17:28:10] <lampd1> i don't js much
[17:28:11] <lampd1> :P
[17:28:23] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/sgmptq8/
[17:28:40] <robertmaxrees> also, you might want to attach to the window scroll event, not the document.
[17:32:14] <lampd1> cool, thanks robertmaxrees
[17:32:30] <lampd1> why switch to window for scroll event?
[17:32:40] <lampd1> cross browser compatibility?
[17:33:57] <robertmaxrees> because that's the thing that's scrolling ;)
[17:34:42] <lampd1> cool :) thx
[17:35:15] <lampd1> but i'll still want to do document.scrollTop() corrent
[17:35:31] <lampd1> nvm using window for that too
[17:35:34] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:42:57] <Bryzzle> hey
[17:42:59] <Bryzzle> brb
[17:47:26] <harty83> is there a way to have scroll: false on draggable but then enable scroll on the clone after drop?
[20:18:15] <bonhoeffer> i have a $(form).submit() that doesn’t seem to be running — any troubleshooting options?
[20:18:57] <wa5ted> bonhoeffer: look at the api documentation and run some console.logs
[20:19:43] <bonhoeffer> yeah — i have a bunch of console.logs — which help, but clicking on the button which is supposed to trigger form submission seems to do nothing, but generate the console logs
[20:19:57] <bonhoeffer> https://gist.github.com/tbbooher/31c46f7f9caea12118e6
[20:20:11] <bonhoeffer> this works on my localhost, but not in production
[20:24:56] <bonhoeffer> goodness — it works now — just by adding console logs . . .
[20:26:22] <bonhoeffer> or only works for the first submission
[21:12:25] <Chulbul> Is there a better way to find max value from this json like this -> [[1418860800000,1],[1419206400000,2],[1419292800000,3],[1419379200000,1],[1419465600000,1],[1419638400000,5],[1419724800000,7]], I want max value from second index that is 7.
[21:14:24] <Harrit>  happy new year!
[21:17:08] <Chulbul> happy new year
[23:11:51] <Mark_2> does anybody have any idea how to emulate this website’s main page (word rotator, and the slides) http://themeforest.unitedthemes.com/wpversions/brooklyn/demo9/

[23:32:57] <jqmnoob> hi guys. i am trying to find a reliable way of activating functions when i switch pages using jquery mobile
[23:34:14] <jqmnoob> when using "$( document ).on( "pagecreate", "#advance_search", function() { " i only get the first time i get to that page
[23:34:37] <jqmnoob> if i go back and enter again, it does not fire
[23:34:55] <jqmnoob> i also tried pageinit
[23:35:01] <jqmnoob> no dice
[23:36:01] <jqmnoob> the only thing that seems to be functioning reliably here is var page = $(':mobile-pagecontainer').pagecontainer('getActivePage')[0].id;
[23:36:15] <jqmnoob> which gives me the current page
[23:36:43] <jqmnoob> i am puting it in a setInterval loop to know which page i am on
[23:36:56] <jqmnoob> iknow there must be a better way.
[23:46:58] <aracodex> hello all, happy new year, just wanted to verify if _.property is working for u guys
