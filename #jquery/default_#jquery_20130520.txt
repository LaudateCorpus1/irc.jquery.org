[00:00:14] <Cork> ericelliott: that's not true
[00:00:33] <bananasdoom> <script>

[00:00:38] <bananasdoom> 		  });
[00:00:40] <bananasdoom> 		});
[00:00:42] <Cork> delegate isn't deprecated, just as little as .bind .click or the other
[00:00:42] <bananasdoom> 	</script>
[00:00:47] <bananasdoom> Sorry for spamming
[00:00:49] <Cork> bananasdoom: don't dump your code in the channel
[00:00:59] <ericelliott> Cork: From the jQuery docs: "As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method." http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[00:01:14] <Cork> superseded yes !== deprecated
[00:01:23] <bananasdoom> really sorry for spaming
[00:01:28] <Cork> it means if you use delegate it will use on internally
[00:01:39] <Cork> but there is no plans for removing delegate or no need to
[00:01:41] <sahilsk> ericelliott: thanks but  am  using 1.9 for now. So, i'm not worry about depreceation. However, thanks for the fact. I'll keep that in mind in future
[00:01:51] <Cork> as it is a simple shim to support it
[00:02:00] <sahilsk> Cork: :( how to bind it then? little clue please
[00:02:04] <bananasdoom> Cork: have I done it correctly
[00:02:06] <Cork> sahilsk: it isn't deprecated
[00:02:19] <Cork> bananasdoom: no
[00:02:26] <bananasdoom> ok
[00:02:41] <Cork> you you queue the ajax call run .cycle and then you get the data from index
[00:02:47] <Cork> you need to use the callback to load
[00:03:17] <Cork> sahilsk: the point is that delegate has nothing to do with it
[00:03:29] <ericelliott> Cork: Deprecation doesn't mean that there are immediate plans to remove the feature. It means that you should avoid the feature -- generally *because it has been superseded*.
[00:04:00] <sahilsk> Cork: yes, i can see. But i want to bind event to "select" elements  found under current context.
[00:04:03] <Cork> ericelliott: yes, but superseded isn't the same as deprecated
[00:04:24] <Cork> it just means it is *the preferred function*
[00:04:26] <ericelliott> Cork: what is the practical difference here?
[00:04:27] <Cork> nothing else
[00:04:39] <ericelliott> Cork: you're describing deprecation.
[00:04:44] <ericelliott> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation
[00:05:01] <Cork> no deprecate means you should AVOID it cause it will soon be removed
[00:05:09] <Cork> it a HUGE difference
[00:05:41] <bananasdoom> Cork: so do I go "load("index.html #InnerContentDiv", function()"
[00:05:47] <ericelliott> Cork: no, it doesn't always mean that it will soon be removed. See HTML tags which are not removed a decade after deprecation.
[00:05:48] <Cork> bananasdoom: yes
[00:05:59] <bananasdoom> Cork: Thanks
[00:06:07] <Cork> ericelliott: html is an exception as nothing is never removed there
[00:06:13] <ravenzz> that I define a special event say foo, an alias and a noConflict function for it. Would this work $(elem).on("foo", doSomething); $.fn.foo.noConflict(); ? or the noConflict invocation will break $(elem).on("foo", doSomething); ?
[00:06:14] <Cork> *is ever removed
[00:06:15] <sahilsk> Cork: how should i refactor this? $(this).parent().delegate(  .. should it be   $(this)...i don't know. do i need create global variable to store 'select"
[00:06:36] <ericelliott> Cork: From the first paragraph of the deprecation wikipedia page: "Deprecation is a status applied to a computer software feature, characteristic, or practice indicating it should be avoided, typically because of being superseded."
[00:06:47] <ericelliott> Cork: that's exactly the case with .delegate()
[00:06:47] <ravenzz> bad time to ask a question :p
[00:06:54] <Cork> sahilsk: so you want to grab the parent of the element skBringDropSelection is run on?
[00:07:08] <Cork> ericelliott: no it's not
[00:07:19] <ericelliott> Cork: It's not just HTML. It's anything that follows the open/closed principle.
[00:07:30] <sahilsk> <span> which i've added  dynamically over  skBringDropSelection . Yes, what you said.
[00:07:31] <Cork> "practice indicating it should be avoided, typically because of being superseded." is not correct for delegate
[00:07:41] <sahilsk> Cork:  <span> which i've added  dynamically over  skBringDropSelection . Yes, what you said.
[00:08:19] <Cork> ericelliott: if delegate is deprecated so should bind, click and all the other too
[00:08:26] <Cork> it has NO COST to support it
[00:08:31] <ericelliott> Cork: that's exactly correct for delegate. I quoted the jQuery docs and referenced the bit that says essentially that. I've cited two sources to support my argument. You've basically said, "no, you're wrong". I'm done with you.
[00:09:21] <Cork> ericelliott: when the jquery lib deprecate a command it is called deprecated, delegate IS NOT
[00:09:53] <Cork> it is superseded, with a new command but there is NOTHING preventing you from using the old one'
[00:10:09] * MickRip beats up ericelliott
[00:10:14] <Cork> it is supported, it will keep beeing supported
[00:10:21] <Cork> it IS NOT deprecated!
[00:10:31] <sahilsk> Cork: any idea?
[00:10:57] * ericelliott kicks MickRip in the shins and steals his guitars
[00:11:01] <MickRip> aaaaa
[00:11:17] <Cork> sahilsk: you need to delegate the event listener to a parent outside the dynamic span then
[00:11:17] * ericelliott plays "Mr Nipple"
[00:11:31] <Cork> delegate can't work up the tree, just down
[00:12:12] <sahilsk> so, if  the selector element should change to "span select"
[00:12:13] <sahilsk> ?
[00:12:22] <Cork> sahilsk: also skBringDropSelection can't run on an element that doesn't exist
[00:13:07] <Cork> $(document).delegate('select', 'focusout'
[00:13:28] <Cork> or another element is you have an existing parent to the select already
[00:13:38] <sahilsk> Cork: no. I doon't want the event on all "select" .
[00:13:48] <ericelliott> MickRip: I have your old mods, and I WILL release viral videos of duck porn with MR soundtracks.
[00:14:04] <Cork> sahilsk: then you need to replace it with an EXISTING parent
[00:14:24] <Cork> you can't use $(this).(future existing-but-not-yet-existing-parent)
[00:14:40] <sahilsk> $(this).delegate(" existing future" ..??
[00:14:50] <Cork> if it is a child
[00:14:56] <Cork> so ex for future option elements
[00:16:13] <bananasdoom> Cork: so I need to go "$("#OuterContentDiv").load("index.html #InnerContentDiv", function() { $('.slideshow').cycle...
[00:16:21] <Cork> yes
[00:16:41] <sahilsk> problem is , $(this) is child here and i want the event to a element who is its sibling.. <span class=
[00:16:59] <Cork> sahilsk: do you have another parent in the page?
[00:17:07] <Cork> if not, then you need to bind it on document
[00:17:34] <sahilsk> i'ts like this :  <span class='future'>  <input class='existing'> <select class='future'> </span>  and i  $(this) pointing to  <input class='existing'>.  I want event to attach to <select class='future'.
[00:17:44] <Cork> ex. $(document).delegate('span select', 'focusin')
[00:18:06] <Cork> you can't do that
[00:18:13] <MickRip> ericelliott: hahahaha, YES! Always wanted to do that
[00:18:15] <sahilsk> Cork: this is the problem. any hind would be great
[00:18:21] <sahilsk> *hint
[00:18:30] <Cork> sahilsk: add a wrapper around the section
[00:18:39] <Cork> use it as a prarent
[00:18:39] <kostodo> will .click() work if an element is behind another element?
[00:18:41] <Cork> *parent
[00:19:06] <Cork> kostodo: you mean covered?
[00:19:08] <Cork> no
[00:19:12] <kostodo> yeah
[00:19:20] <bananasdoom> Cork: It does not work :( well the way I have done it
[00:19:26] <Cork> no you can only click the top most element
[00:19:28] <kostodo> Cork: is there another method I could use?
[00:19:28] <sahilsk> Cork: okeah
[00:19:42] <ericelliott> Cork: Just for fun... "As of jQuery 1.7, the .on() method is the preferred method for attaching event handlers to a document."
[00:19:45] <Cork> kosibar: z-index, make the element top most
[00:19:57] <ericelliott> Cork: From http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[00:19:59] <bananasdoom> http://pastebin.com/qiiarv8X
[00:19:59] <Cork> ericelliott: yes, never said anything about that
[00:20:08] <bananasdoom> my code ^
[00:20:15] <Cork> but deprecated means something completely difference
[00:20:28] <JohnnyCash^^^> guys
[00:20:30] <Cork> a command that is deprecated means it will be removed in a future release
[00:20:33] <kostodo> Cork: I can't. Its a flex slider slideshow and the next/prev handlers are top most
[00:20:37] <JohnnyCash^^^> anyone knows a plugin to change HUE of a picture?
[00:20:53] <kostodo> Cork: I want to fire an action when any area of the slideshow is clicked
[00:20:56] <ericelliott> Cork	ericelliott: "if delegate is deprecated so should bind, click and all the other too"
[00:21:11] <bananasdoom> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4143227/jquery-change-hue-saturation-gamma-of-img
[00:21:18] <ericelliott> Cork: 'click' is a shortcut for .on('click' ...
[00:21:20] <Cork> ericelliott: sigh... but THEY ARE NOT!!!
[00:21:22] <Cork> sigh
[00:21:34] <Cork> they would have a deprecated mark if they where
[00:21:36] <Cork> man...
[00:21:36] <JohnnyCash^^^> bananasdoom: thanks but those are really do that
[00:21:48] <bananasdoom> ??
[00:21:58] <kostodo> Cork: any idea?
[00:22:44] <Cork> kostodo: you would have to bind the click element on the top most element, and check it's x y position and calculate it from that
[00:23:05] <Cork> the event object has the mouse current position
[00:23:37] <bananasdoom> If someone could please read my code snipit and point out what I am dooing wrong that would be awsome http://pastebin.com/qiiarv8X
[00:23:40] <kostodo> Cork: would have no idea how to do that
[00:24:05] <Cork> kostodo: then the only other option would be to have the element ontop
[00:24:33] <ericelliott> Cork: You're right.
[00:25:30] <MickRip> bananasdoom: I don't think you have enough brackets
[00:26:13] <MickRip> bananasdoom: no, you have too many :O
[00:26:32] <bananasdoom> yep
[00:27:10] <bananasdoom> MickRip: But .load wont work
[00:27:12] <Cork> bananasdoom: is #InnerContentDiv containing the .slideshow?
[00:27:19] <MickRip> bananasdoom: You are missing a curly bracket. I'd probably intent it properly
[00:27:24] <Cork> });); <--
[00:27:30] <MickRip> *indent
[00:27:41] <ericelliott> {{{'Never too many brackets'}}} // valid JS
[00:27:44] <ericelliott> I'm so helpful.
[00:27:44] <Cork> should have been });
[00:28:06] <bananasdoom> thanks
[00:28:38] <MickRip> bananasdoom: put it into jsfiddle and hit tidy, that'll probably help validate that a little bit (or auto indent in your IDE and watch where it falls over)
[00:29:06] <bananasdoom> MickRip: will do
[00:29:56] <ericelliott> MickRip: http://ericleads.com/2013/05/stampit-0-3-released/ and http://ericleads.com/2013/05/qconf-0-1-2-released/ -- I've been busy.
[00:30:42] <MickRip> ericelliott: no, I've been writing my MVP php framework - it's ready for prod though. So I might node it soon. I've apparently get a soundtrack to finish for a TV show so I'm conflicted, aaa
[00:32:17] <MickRip> ericelliott: I also know nearly nothing about node except what it does.
[00:33:09] <funhouse> Is it possible to specify x,y coords with animate() ?
[00:33:56] <MickRip> funhouse: top/left absolute positioning?
[00:35:25] <funhouse> MickRip: what I'm asking is, it seems I can only specify how many px to move left/top I want to specify exact coord, I guess I need to figure out where currently element is then find target element
[00:36:46] <dnsdds> Apparently $("<htmltags><stuff></stuff><foo /></htmltags>") produces an unrecognized expression problem in jQuery 2.0.0 and 1.9.1. However, not problems in 1.x edge, 2.x edge, 1.8.3 or 1.7.2
[00:37:05] <dnsdds> Is there any syntax for the same thing that wouldn't cause issues in any version?
[00:37:54] <Cork> dnsdds: do you have spaces at the beginning of the html string?
[00:38:08] <dnsdds> Cork: Probably. Is that an issue?
[00:38:12] <Cork> cause as you showed it it shouldn't break
[00:38:23] <Cork> dnsdds: there is currently a bug in jquery yes
[00:39:29] <dnsdds> Cork: So it should go away if I just $.trim() ?
[00:39:50] <Cork> if it's caused by that yes
[00:43:52] <kostodo> How would I make jQuery set cursor to "hand"
[00:43:53] <kostodo> ?
[00:44:14] <bananasdoom> I must be really slow becasue I cant figure out how to murge .cycle() into .load()
[00:44:17] <Cork> set a class with the cursor you want
[00:44:18] <bananasdoom> cycle
[00:44:26] <bananasdoom> http://pastebin.com/XExfL9mB
[00:48:42] <Cork> dnsdds: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13223
[00:48:49] <Cork> sorry for the delay took me a while to find the bug
[00:50:36] <dnsdds> Cork: Seems like a dumb bug to have, but using $.trim certainly did fix it! Thanks!
[00:50:50] <Cork> dnsdds: it is fixed, already, just not released yet
[00:51:17] <Turaylon> Hi all, someone have ever used the multidatepicker plugin extention for datepicker? ( http://multidatespickr.sourceforge.net/ )
[00:55:03] <dnsdds> Cork: Now, as a part of a plugin, I'm creating an element like this:  var element = $("<div></div>"); and then .appending the variable. However, when the plugin is used multiple times on one page, any events I bind to the variable only happen on the last instance. Would you how to fix that? :)
[00:55:29] <Cork> dnsdds: bind on a static parent
[00:55:34] <Cork> and use delegation
[00:56:06] <dnsdds> Cork: Human English, please?
[00:56:24] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[00:57:21] <dnsdds> Cork: I know about that, but does that alone fix it? What's the "static parent" part?
[00:57:24] <kc8qvp> cd
[00:57:28] <kc8qvp> whoops :)
[00:57:53] <Cork> dnsdds: <div id="container"></div> $('#container').append(div)
[00:58:03] <kc8qvp> cd
[00:58:06] <Cork> <_<
[00:58:09] <kc8qvp> lol, sigh :/
[00:58:20] <Cork> it's still not a terminal
[00:59:04] <dnsdds> Cork: fhh, I don't really have a static parent like that; I'm actually using this code to create the very wrapper inside of which I .append and .find and .bind all sorts of things
[00:59:38] <kostodo> How can I animate toggleClass?
[00:59:51] <Cork> dnsdds: then you either have to run the event binder separatly for each element, or bind it on $(document)
[01:00:12] <Cork> kostodo: jquery-ui has that support built in
[01:00:16] <Cork> else you need a plugin
[01:00:23] <kostodo> which plugin?
[01:00:36] <sahilsk> Cork: I did what you said and it's working as expected. Thanks the help. However, any clue why am not seeing user passed options. allowEmpty should be true  but it's always picking from settings
[01:00:38] <sahilsk> http://jsfiddle.net/sahilsk/93Dgt/
[01:01:39] <Cork> kostodo: not sure if there is an already built plugin with just that code from jquery-ui
[01:02:20] <kostodo> Not in Drupal 7
[01:03:47] <Cork> kostodo: you could download jquery ui with just the effect core
[01:03:53] <Cork> and you would get those function calls
[01:04:07] <JosephFerano> hello people, I have a table and I would like to have divs or something be added to the end of the table next to the respective td (it's an error message per row), how can I achieve this?
[01:04:12] <Cork> kostodo: http://jqueryui.com/download
[01:04:40] <Cork> JosephFerano: you can't have divs next to td's in a table
[01:04:44] <Cork> it's not valid
[01:04:56] <JosephFerano> right, so what's the best way of achieving this then?
[01:05:13] <JosephFerano> thanks for helping me btw
[01:05:25] <Cork> you could try setting the td to an offset parent and use position absolute
[01:05:38] <Cork> but i don't remember if that works; i have a vage memory it isn't
[01:05:45] <Cork> *doesn't
[01:06:23] <Cork> alternative options would be adding extra td's i guess
[01:06:48] <Cork> or using javascript and positioning the elements based on the values from the td's (i really don't like that solution though)
[01:08:21] <JosephFerano> how could I add an extra td while keeping all other rows transparent?
[01:08:44] <Cork> ooh...
[01:09:07] <Cork> colspan is the best i could suggest :/
[01:09:31] <JosephFerano> ok
[01:09:52] <JosephFerano> I'd have to look into it because I'm writing out the tds with javascript
[01:10:29] <Cork> JosephFerano: http://jsfiddle.net/mb4hy/
[01:10:55] <JosephFerano> oh I see
[01:10:58] <Cork> the td can't be an offset parent, but you can wrap the content in a span or div and use that
[01:11:00] <JosephFerano> that would work great, thanks
[01:11:35] <JosephFerano> let me try it out, one second
[01:17:25] <dnsdds> Cork: I don't really understand how I would go about doing that; It's a plugin, so I can't really touch the other instances and binding to document and delegating doesn't solve the problem that the variable (being the only reference to what I've created) refers to the latest one, not the current one
[01:18:02] <Cork> dnsdds: could you show the code you have problem with?
[01:18:43] <dnsdds> Cork: https://github.com/groenroos/minimalect/blob/master/jquery.minimalect.js
[01:20:07] <dnsdds> Cork: Line 52 and onwards, basically
[01:20:29] <Cork> dnsdds: and is the keyup the problem or what?
[01:21:27] <dnsdds> Cork: So far the click on line 83; clicking on any dropdown opens the last dropdown
[01:21:36] <JosephFerano> Cork: I see where it's messing up for me, it's important to have the content of the td wrapped around a div right?
[01:22:10] <Cork> dnsdds: so you have multiple dropdowns in the same wrapper?
[01:22:38] <Cork> JosephFerano: content of the wrapped in a div, not around the div; but yes
[01:22:50] <JosephFerano> cool
[01:22:52] <Cork> like i said before the td can't be an offset parent
[01:23:01] <Cork> so you need another element to take that role
[01:23:10] <Cork> like a span or a div
[01:23:28] <dnsdds> Cork: No, the wrapper is a single dropdown, and it's created separately for each dropdown. See the problem in action here; http://jsfiddle.net/groenroos/Juhne/36/
[01:23:52] <Cork> dnsdds: the how would you leak between the dropdowns?
[01:24:24] <dnsdds> Cork: What do you mean?
[01:24:25] <Cork> ah
[01:24:40] <Cork> dnsdds: are you sure you want $(this) and not this.element?
[01:25:04] <Cork> oh, wait thats m.element
[01:25:10] <Cork> hmm
[01:25:40] <Cork> dnsdds: well as you bind the event listener on the wrapper, the event wouldn't happen on another plugin dropdown
[01:25:52] <Cork> so somewhere you leak so you only have one reference
[01:26:02] <Cork> ex. like a missing var
[01:27:05] <dnsdds> Gah... I don't even have a clue what I should be looking for
[01:27:24] <Cork> dnsdds: where are you expanding the dropdown?
[01:28:08] <dnsdds> Cork: line 83 binds it, calls toggleChoices on line 173, which then goes to line 180 for showChoices
[01:29:55] <paulvd> hello, i have a div in a page with an image, which is moving across the screen. is there any way i can shrink the image as it goes up and expand as it comes down?
[01:30:26] <Cork> dnsdds: uh... why didn't i see this the first time i looked...
[01:30:41] <Cork> dnsdds: line 49 is the problem
[01:30:44] <Cork> m is global
[01:31:04] <dnsdds> Cork: hurp derp
[01:31:10] <Cork> so every time you initialize a new instance of the plugin you overwrite it
[01:31:19] <bananasdoom> Cork: sorry to bother you again but I cant seem to get this to work, I have added the function but it wont load :( have I done the function wrong again? http://pastebin.com/qiiarv8X
[01:31:45] <Cork> paulvd: sure, use an img tag and just change it's width and height
[01:31:56] <lexflex3000> does anyone here have experience with the plugin CarouFredSel?
[01:32:09] <paulvd> Cork...i know that
[01:32:19] <paulvd> i want to shrink the image as it moves up the window
[01:32:23] <paulvd> and expand as it moves down
[01:32:24] <paulvd> :)
[01:32:34] <Cork> yes, and i just told you how you do it...
[01:32:42] <paulvd> change its width and height huh
[01:32:47] <dnsdds> Cork: Well that was blatantly idiotic of me. Thank you for your patience :)
[01:32:55] <paulvd> so i will change it for animation ??
[01:33:03] <Cork> yes
[01:33:43] <Cork> bananasdoom: have you verified that the load succeeds?
[01:33:49] <paulvd> you are not getting what i am trying to achieve
[01:34:05] <bananasdoom> paulvdL: CSS animation
[01:34:29] <Cork> paulvd: if you want to change an image size, cross browsers an <img> tag where you change it's sizes is the only way
[01:34:44] <Cork> you can do it with transform, but then you lose all older browsers
[01:35:27] <bananasdoom> cork: the .load() works
[01:35:48] <Cork> bananasdoom: and the selector in the callback matches elements?
[01:35:55] <paulvd> i will make a fiddle hold on
[01:36:02] <Cork> oh, wait
[01:36:06] <Cork> your missing the $
[01:36:19] <Cork> ('.slideshow').cycle({ fx: 'fade'}) => $('.slideshow').cycle({ fx: 'fade'})
[01:37:37] <bananasdoom> Cork: YES YOU ARE AWSOME!!!!!
[01:38:38] * bananasdoom Basks in Corks awesomeness
[01:41:21] <sahilsk> how do i get selector text?  i mean $(".classOne, .classTow"). I want to access to know which class trigger and want to output the same on console.
[01:42:48] <Cork> in a plugin?
[01:43:09] <Cork> this.selector
[01:45:31] <sahilsk> Cork: naah. am getting empty string with $(this).selector
[01:46:05] <Cork> you can't use it in an event
[01:46:20] <sahilsk> $(".skBringDropSelection, .skBringDropSelection01  ").bind("change", function(){     var oldClass =  $(this).attr("class");     console.log( this.selector );
[01:46:33] <sahilsk> how to get .skBringDropSelection name?
[01:46:48] <Cork> you can't
[01:46:57] <sahilsk> oh..
[01:46:58] <sahilsk> :(
[01:47:05] <Cork> cause when change fires there is no connection between the selector and the event
[01:47:27] <sahilsk> i see..
[01:47:33] <Cork> $(".skBringDropSelection, .skBringDropSelection01  ").selector === ".skBringDropSelection, .skBringDropSelection01  "
[01:47:54] <Cork> in bind this is an element, not jquery
[01:48:01] <Cork> and $(this) doesn't have a selector
[01:54:31] <paulvd> Cork: see this fiddle
[01:54:32] <paulvd> http://jsfiddle.net/u39pK/1/
[01:54:44] <paulvd> i want to shrink the image as iamge moves up
[01:54:50] <paulvd> proportionate to the way it moves up
[01:54:55] <paulvd> like the more up the more smaller
[01:54:58] <paulvd> did you get it now/
[01:55:39] <Cork> so change it's width and height...
[01:56:54] <Cork> you have explained the question enough before, if you want to scale an image change it's dimensions
[02:00:51] <ravenzz> if I define a special event say foo, an alias and a noConflict function for it... Would this work $(elem).on("foo", doSomething); $.fn.foo.noConflict(); ? or the noConflict invocation will break $(elem).on("foo", doSomething); ?
[02:01:38] <Cork> ravenzz: $.fn.foo has nothing to do with noConflict or the event
[02:01:44] <paulvd> my god
[02:01:56] <paulvd> PROPORTIONATE to the position, the more up the more smaller
[02:02:06] <paulvd> hwo can i change height and width manually lol
[02:02:11] <paulvd> i can change it through css
[02:02:19] <paulvd> but then it be same height and width
[02:03:55] <ravenzz> Cork I forgot to mention that I also define an alias function for the special event
[02:04:00] <ravenzz> $(elem).foo()
[02:04:06] <ravenzz> that's why noConflict
[02:05:07] <anli_> Sometimes, when I have appended my element, I can use css('height'), or use .height() on it, but sometimes, that will give me 0, how come?
[02:05:16] <Cork> ravenzz: noConflict still doesn't make sence
[02:05:17] <anli_> It uses a class btw
[02:05:33] <Cork> ravenzz: it's for releasing the jquery object, not functions on it
[02:05:35] <anli_> The class foo, and I have .foo { height: 90px; } in the css file
[02:06:05] <ravenzz> Cork in my case it is for releasing the foo fn
[02:06:21] <ravenzz> meaning that you can restore the previous one if exists
[02:06:44] <ravenzz> $(elem).foo(); $.fn.foo.noConflict()
[02:07:00] <Cork> ravenzz: you can't do that
[02:07:08] <Cork> noConflict is for jquery not functions
[02:07:13] <ravenzz> -.-
[02:07:18] <Cork> $ or jQuery nothing else
[02:07:19] <anli_> I have problems reading the css of an appended object if the script is running upon a clean cache, the next time I access the webpage, it works
[02:07:27] <ravenzz> Cork let me show you some code
[02:07:31] <anli_> Is it a firefox bug then?
[02:08:35] <ravenzz> Cork http://pastie.org/7933341
[02:09:08] <Cork> anli_: ....
[02:09:13] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[02:09:16] <anli_> :)
[02:09:37] <Cork> ravenzz: your creating a function called noConflict that does something completely different...
[02:09:45] <Cork> i would say thats a BAD idea
[02:10:01] <ravenzz> uhm maybe it is useless
[02:10:06] <ravenzz> but why it is a bad idea?
[02:10:42] <Cork> cause the one reading the could and not knowing about your plugin would react the same way i just did...
[02:11:55] <ravenzz> should I drop it then?
[02:12:05] <Cork> i would rename it
[02:12:13] <Cork> if you feel you need it
[02:12:33] <Cork> not sure what it would help with though
[02:13:04] <Cork> cause if you run the noConflict call your plugin wouldn't work as the call would be gone right?
[02:13:15] <Cork> so... what edge case would it fix?
[02:13:19] <ravenzz> Cork well that was my question
[02:13:35] <ravenzz> since the event is asynchronous
[02:13:37] <Cork> i would prob try to reduce the number of function names i expose
[02:13:49] <Cork> and instead put them behind a broker
[02:13:55] <ravenzz> I was wondering what is going to happen if I invoke noConflict
[02:13:58] <Cork> that way you get less risk of a conflict
[02:14:35] <Cork> you would remove the functions from the jQuery object $ points to
[02:16:15] <ravenzz> Cork to be more specific I am not concerned about $.fn.foo but $.event.special.foo
[02:16:47] <ravenzz> I mean I am pretty sure that if I restore the old $.fn.foo it will work (the even)
[02:16:49] <Cork> $.event.special.foo would be undefined if it wasn't defined before your plugin defined it
[02:16:50] <ravenzz> event*/
[02:17:27] <ravenzz> but if I restore $.event.special.foo too probably it is going to break
[02:18:02] <Cork> i find the entire code a bit weird so...
[02:18:07] <ravenzz> you know what, I am going to drop it
[02:18:22] <ravenzz> if the developer is that stupid to
[02:18:27] <Cork> cause if you're really lucky jquery has used special to find events and then when it tries to clean up...
[02:18:35] <ravenzz> assign click to jqre.eventName
[02:18:44] <ravenzz> is not a problem of mine
[02:19:02] <Cork> huh?
[02:19:19] <Ritzton> I am sorry would you know how with ejs to escape html but to replace \n by <br /> ?
[02:19:50] <Cork> replace(/\n/g', '<br>')
[02:20:18] <ravenzz> Cork the special event name is holded into an object obj.eventName = "foo"; $.event.special[obj.eventName] = {}
[02:20:48] <Cork> ravenzz: but why are you defining special event code for basic events??
[02:20:58] <ravenzz> if someone changes the eventName's value to "click" I guess it is going to mess up everything
[02:21:41] <Ritzton> Cork> have you ever used EJS ?
[02:21:52] <Cork> not sure what ejs is
[02:21:54] <Cork> so no
[02:22:14] <ravenzz> Cork I needed a resizeEnd event, so I created a special event
[02:22:18] <ravenzz> I need*
[02:22:30] <Cork> ravenzz: but why do you need special?
[02:22:41] <Cork> you want to face resizeEnd based on something else?
[02:22:45] <Cork> *fake
[02:22:59] <ravenzz> sure
[02:23:03] <ravenzz> resize
[02:23:04] <Ritzton> Cork> http://jsdoc.info/visionmedia/ejs/ and <%= code.replace(/\n/g', '<br>') %> does not work
[02:23:07] <ravenzz> the resize event
[02:23:17] <anli_> Strange, sometimes, I cannot use .css on a newly appended element...
[02:23:23] <Cork> if you're plugin just does a $().trigger('resizeEnd') it would work without special
[02:23:25] <anli_> Will not get anything
[02:24:06] <ravenzz> Cork sure, but $(window).on("resizeEnd", fn) is handy
[02:24:32] <Cork> ravenzz: sure, but i still question, why do you need special?
[02:24:34] <ravenzz> I pmd you the source
[02:24:36] * hawtin photoshop dutty calling(@_@)
[02:25:00] <ravenzz> Cork how do you define a custom event then?
[02:25:01] <sahilsk> how to get all strings wtih pattern  "color_xxx"? http://scriptular.com/#(color_%5Ba-zA-Z%5D%2B)%7C%7C%7C%7Ci%7C%7C%7C%7C%5B%22skBringDropSelection%20color_NA%20color_NOK%22%5D
[02:25:15] <Cork> ravenzz: most of them don't need to be defiend
[02:25:22] <Cork> ravenzz: specially not if they are global
[02:25:38] <Cork> $(window).on('resize', function() { $(this).trigger('resizeEnd'); })
[02:25:56] <Cork> thats all you need to create a resizeEnd event on window
[02:26:00] <ravenzz> Cork ok but I want to make a plugin out of it
[02:26:14] <Cork> so run that one line of code in the plugin then
[02:26:54] <ravenzz> and it would be great if it can be bound on any elem
[02:28:03] <Cork> that is a little tougher as the trigger all listeners is removed in 1.9+
[02:28:28] <kostodo> Which library would I need for toggleClass UI to work?
[02:28:38] <ravenzz> there is a plugin by ben alman that enables the resize event forelements other than window
[02:28:43] <Cork> kostodo: uh... i answered that like 2h ago...
[02:28:44] <ravenzz> for instance
[02:29:33] <kostodo> Cork: yes but I can't find ONLY the toggleClass event
[02:29:45] <Cork> kostodo: i answered that too
[02:29:52] <kostodo> its in effects core?
[02:29:57] <Cork> yes
[02:30:21] <Cork> its like 100 lines of code including comments
[02:30:55] <Cork> (give or take didn't count it)
[02:31:33] <Cork> ravenzz: well you can trigger a resize event on all elements when the window is resized
[02:31:55] <Cork> but it is A LOT harder to make it valid when the content in the page changes for some reasons
[02:32:27] <Cork> ex from a sibling going from position relative to position absolute for example
[02:32:55] <ravenzz> maybe with a special event one can also benefit of event delegation?
[02:33:09] <Cork> not really
[02:33:38] <Cork> only thing you get with special is that you get extra function calls when the element is added through jquery (and removed and trigger is called)
[02:35:08] <ravenzz> I see
[02:41:32] <Cork> ravenzz: but yes, if you want to be able to fire the resize event on any element on the page, you need special
[02:43:57] <kostodo> Cork: <script type="text/javascript" src="ui/jquery.effects.core.min.js?v=1.8.7"></script> is loaded but if I do classToggle('classname', 1000); nothing works
[02:44:07] <kostodo> classToggle('classname') works however
[02:49:17] <Cork> kostodo: wfm http://jsfiddle.net/jxF7f/
[02:55:58] <kostodo> Cork: hmm works in jsfiddle but not on my page.
[02:56:18] <Cork> make sure you have the code loaded before you try to use it
[02:58:40] <kostodo> Yeah it's definitely loaded
[03:00:13] <kostodo> Cork: see private msg. Idea is that when apartment slideshow (.flexslider img) is clicked it attaches class called .full-width to .group-left .group-middle and .group-right
[03:00:48] <kostodo> Within that row
[03:00:59] <kostodo> You will see on that page that effects library is loaded
[03:01:17] <Cork> kostodo: don't randomly pm ppl
[03:01:28] <kostodo> Cork:  I only sent you the URL.
[03:01:32] <Cork> and no i don't see it as i have pm disabled
[03:01:33] <roy_raider> hi ! I have a small problem with the .show('slide' ….. it display my <li> with "list-item", I want them as "block"
[03:01:38] <roy_raider> how can i fix that ? :D
[03:02:04] <Cork> roy_raider: hide them with .hide() and set the block in the css file
[03:02:33] <roy_raider> yes i already hide them with .hide('slide'….
[03:02:48] <roy_raider> hmm ok i will change the CSS maybe ! ;P
[03:02:58] <Cork> roy_raider: i meant the initial hide
[03:03:09] <Cork> don't have display: none; in the css file
[03:03:35] <Cork> cause then jquery have to fall back to the default for the display it goes to
[03:03:55] <roy_raider> oh it's work, ok thanks Cork it was easy finally.
[03:04:11] <kostodo> Cork: OK. well.
[03:04:15] <roy_raider> i though it was an option ! :P
[03:07:48] <lexflex3000> I'm working on a project that contains an image carousel, what is a good plugin to do this: http://i.imgur.com/z5Lu17F.png
[03:08:11] <lexflex3000> or would you simply code something yourself?
[03:08:45] <lexflex3000> the framework used for the projecti s bootstrap
[03:09:48] <coldhead> lotta people just use this, lexflex3000 http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/examples/static_auto.html
[03:10:50] <JosephFerano> is there a way to do this?
[03:11:00] <JosephFerano> $(".error-message").get(index).hide();
[03:11:39] <JosephFerano> that spits out an error message
[03:11:46] <coldhead> JosephFerano: you want eq() instead of get()
[03:11:52] <JosephFerano> ok, thank you
[03:11:54] <coldhead> get returns the actual dom element
[03:11:57] <coldhead> with no jquery magic
[03:12:01] <coldhead> and hide() is jquery magic
[03:13:04] <lexflex3000> coldhead: are there other options that are not beta versions?
[03:14:08] <coldhead> lexflex3000: google can give you many many many many more options
[03:14:19] <coldhead> but jcarousel is a beloved and trusted favourite
[03:14:31] <coldhead> if you fear the beta, use the previous version of jcarousel
[03:14:31] <lexflex3000> oh, ok.. see that's why I'm asking here
[03:14:45] <coldhead> which was the beloved and trusted favourite of yesteryear
[03:14:49] <coldhead> and not beta
[03:14:53] <lexflex3000> google is one thing but I'd rather hear it from experienced jQuery people what they would use..
[03:15:08] <lexflex3000> are there other beloved and trusted favs?
[03:15:26] <coldhead> some people like the fancy stuff like nivoslider
[03:15:35] <coldhead> but jcarousel looks more like your screenshot
[03:15:45] <coldhead> or you CAN write it yourself
[03:16:21] <lexflex3000> coldhead: can I configure jcarousel to look exactly like my shot?
[03:17:06] <coldhead> yes, that should all just be a matter of CSS
[03:17:10] <coldhead> no JS needed
[03:17:18] <coldhead> once you get it working of course
[03:17:26] <coldhead> if i were you i'd use jcarousel
[03:17:32] <coldhead> but it's up to you!
[03:18:17] <lexflex3000> coldhead: yes I think I'll give it a shot, I tried carouFredSel but it didn't work at all
[03:19:05] <coldhead> that is the worst name for a jquery plugin that i have ever heard
[03:20:25] <lexflex3000> coldhead: how would I go about making this responsive?
[03:20:57] <lexflex3000> I'm using bootstrap so with different browser sizes it will be different image sizes
[03:23:12] <coldhead> hmm, i might use a different carousel then
[03:23:47] <lexflex3000> coldhead: any suggestions?
[03:23:52] <coldhead> yes
[03:23:53] <coldhead> http://filamentgroup.com/lab/responsive_carousel/
[03:24:03] <coldhead> haven't used it yet but filament group do fine work
[03:25:11] <coldhead> might take some messing around to make it show 3 at once
[03:27:42] <lexflex3000> coldhead: it seems like a slider
[03:28:37] <lexflex3000> none of the examples are actually a carousel in the sense that there are multiple images
[03:29:16] <the-noob> hello, can someone please point me to an example of resizing multiple elements with 1 handler ?
[03:29:26] <coldhead> i guess i use the terms carousel and slider interchangeably
[03:29:41] <coldhead> i am not sure what exactly is involved in a responsive carousel
[03:29:48] <coldhead> but i bet it's hard to do well
[03:29:56] <the-noob> what I want is for multiple images to resize when the first one (a specific one) is resized
[03:30:02] <coldhead> i will bow out lest someone else has a better idea
[03:30:43] <coldhead> the-noob: $('.some-common-class').css('height', some_new_height);
[03:31:54] <the-noob> and width, but not sure if that's the only thing needed.. will play a bit with
[03:31:56] <lexflex3000> you're probably right, it's hard to have it work properly
[03:38:57] <innociv_> If I had [true, false, true], or rather an array that isn't entirely trues, what would be the best way to return false?
[03:39:12] <innociv_> Funny thing, if I try to return false in a filter, it doesn't actually return false.
[03:42:18] <Cork> !$.inArray(false, arr)
[03:42:53] <innociv_> Oh yeah.
[03:42:55] <Cork> or $.inArray(false, arr) === -1
[03:43:12] <Cork> i would prob prefer the last one
[03:44:55] <innociv_> Actually I figured out a better way.  checking the length of the array I used to push those trues to begin with, not pushing false, and seeing if array length is the same. Array length has to be the same for all cases to have passed.
[03:45:43] <Cork> ya, that would be a better way
[03:47:34] <adibhanna> hey, i'm getting some data from database, converting it to JSON, and then printing some fields on the screen using jquery. i need to encode the text because it's in arabic windows-1252. how can i do that ?
[03:48:19] <Cork> adibhanna: you should always use utf8 to not get that problem
[03:48:52] <adibhanna> i'm using utf8, but the data i'm getting from the database is not utf8
[03:48:56] <adibhanna> so i need to convert it
[03:49:01] <Cork> that is kinda what i mean
[03:49:07] <Cork> *meant
[03:49:18] <innociv_> You need to change the DB to utf8
[03:49:21] <Cork> you have to find a javascript lib that can do something similar to iconv
[03:49:30] <Cork> or ya, fix the server end
[03:49:52] <Cork> ?g javascript iconv
[03:49:53] <b-ot> Cork: ashtuchkin/iconv-lite · GitHub → https://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite
[03:50:14] <Cork> adibhanna: ^
[03:50:16] <adibhanna> alright guys, thank you
[03:50:21] <adibhanna> i'll check that out
[03:50:22] <Cork> though the correct fix is to fix the server
[03:51:07] <Cork> cause ascii decode and encoding every character in the text is quite horrible waist of speed
[03:53:27] <ServerSage> Hey folks, I'm looking for a plugin to allow <option> tags to support multiple lines of text.  My google prowess seems to be failing me, any suggestions?
[03:54:08] <Cork> ServerSage: you would have to look for one of the many select box replacements
[03:54:20] <Cork> you can't make a normal select support multiple lines
[03:56:29] <Cork> ServerSage: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu for example
[03:58:11] <ServerSage> Cork: Billiant, thanks!
[03:58:29] <innociv_> With regexp, how do I match the start and end of something?  Say I want to select foo and bar from "blah blah (start-mark)foo(end-mark) blah blah (start-mark)bar(end-mark) etc" and maybe chang it to "blah blah FOO blah blah BAR etc" for example.
[03:58:34] <Cork> ServerSage: not sure what state the selectmenu is in though
[03:58:36] <innociv_> Must I tokenize? Or is there regexp for that?
[03:58:41] <Cork> ServerSage: but there is other examples out there
[03:59:27] <ServerSage> Cork: It's a start point.  I've already looked at 4 or 5 others, but seem to be coming up short on ones that support multiple lines of text.
[03:59:48] <Cork> innociv_: /\(start-mark\)(.*)\(end-mark\)/g if the engine supports none greedy regex at least
[03:59:58] <Cork> innociv_: else you need to use look-ahead
[04:00:18] <innociv_> As in, old ECMA versions won't support it?
[04:00:55] <Cork> `js> print('works')
[04:01:00] <b-ot> Cork: works
[04:01:31] <Cork> `js> print("blah blah (start-mark)foo(end-mark) blah blah (start-mark)bar(end-mark) etc".match(/\(start-mark\)(.*)\(end-mark\)/g)
[04:01:34] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[04:01:37] <Cork> eh...
[04:01:39] <jita> I want to parseint out of "(1)" string, what would be the most efficient way to that ?
[04:01:41] <innociv_> Cork, that regexp matched the begining one to the very end one
[04:01:44] <Cork> opps
[04:01:47] <Cork> `js> print("blah blah (start-mark)foo(end-mark) blah blah (start-mark)bar(end-mark) etc".match(/\(start-mark\)(.*)\(end-mark\)/g))
[04:01:49] <innociv_> so "(start-mark)foo(end-mark) blah blah (start-mark)bar(end-mark)"
[04:01:50] <b-ot> Cork: (start-mark)foo(end-mark) blah blah (start-mark)bar(end-mark)
[04:01:53] <innociv_> Yeah
[04:03:15] <innociv_> That's not good~ Whatdo?
[04:04:03] <Cork> hmm i'm no sure javascript supports look ahead
[04:04:19] <mattyh88> hey, i'm using modernizr to load jQuery and my own app.js. But the thing is, code in my app.js gets executed when script is ready. How can I let it execute when document is ready as I'm getting values from the html dom. Thanks
[04:04:47] <innociv_> Ah well
[04:05:00] <Cork> js> print("112233445566".match(/5(?!6/))
[04:05:03] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[04:05:05] <Cork> nope
[04:05:18] <Cork> innociv_: can you adjust the marker?
[04:06:00] <innociv_> I have the marker as [[foo]]
[04:06:14] <Cork> js> print("112233(smark)4455(emark)66".match(/\(smarg\)([(]+)\(emark)/))
[04:06:17] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[04:06:19] <innociv_> I can do what I want by tokenizing. It's jsut way more code
[04:06:25] * Cork officially hate b-ot

[04:07:24] <Cork> bah
[04:07:37] <innociv_> Yeah
[04:07:51] <innociv_> What you can do is have a match function, and that returns the position, and you can look ahead then
[04:08:10] <innociv_> I think indexOf looping is faster, anyway
[04:10:41] <Cork> ya
[04:11:19] <innociv_> lastIndexOf for each, slice, recursive loop.
[04:14:11] <the-noob> anyone knows how can I trigger an update for a 'draggable' ?
[04:14:33] <the-noob> I have a container with a draggable div and the container is resizable
[04:15:06] <the-noob> I need to 'update' the draggable to stay in the container constraint on resize
[04:18:17] <dumbdell> hey
[04:18:27] <dumbdell> whos around today?
[04:19:30] <amaroks> Hey
[04:20:17] <dumbdell> hi amaroks
[04:21:51] <amaroks> Hi dumbdell , whatsup
[04:22:02] <dumbdell> http://jsfiddle.net/rDLUk/142/ <-- any ideas why in that code, the timing is running as millisecs when i specify it as seconds ...
[04:23:40] <dumbdell> my theory: i have a feeling css() is some how chomping the "duration" vars last character off the string so the underlying functionality assumes  millisecs
[04:24:12] <amaroks> dumbdell: not very good at that, maybe Cork can help
[04:24:50] <dumbdell> ok yes good old cork should know ;)
[04:30:45] <dumbdell> for those that helped last time.. the clock is acurate down to the second/ms now, and it keeps the right time all time, and the performance is as good as the css animation subsystem is .. no cooky timers trying to force its hands hehe excuse the puns
[04:32:24] <dumbdell> and compare the cleanlyness of the code to http://apps.eky.hk/css3clock/
[04:35:06] <the_kick> hi there, would .find('div.row.price'); find ALL matching elements, or just the first?
[04:36:24] <the_kick> its ok i read the manual
[04:36:25] <the_kick> :P
[04:41:48] <dumbdell> only thing is with it.. it needs focus/blur too work so you can correct the animation .. because of the whole animation buffering crap when the tabs not active.. but i cant get focus/blur to cooperate on jsfiddle
[04:42:24] <Baseer> Hello
[04:42:33] <Baseer> I need to disable a tab,
[04:43:02] <Baseer> when I click the relevant tab content shouldn't be displayed.
[04:43:10] <Baseer> does any body can help me plz?
[04:46:53] <zissou> when i send data to the same site with ajax. do i need to have the page to refresh for the server side code to kick in?
[04:47:31] <zissou> i mean i do. i know it works then but i have a feeling im not following best practice...
[04:48:35] <dumbdell> zissou that kind of defeats the point of ajax.. if you wanted to refresh the page after ajax completes you can just do document.location or something
[04:49:16] <sacho> zissou, your question doesn't make sense in the regular ways you would be using ajax requests
[04:49:18] <zissou> sure but i need to send a query
[04:49:30] <zissou> i mean $_GET variable
[04:49:45] <zissou> then php knows what to do using conditionals
[04:50:24] <dumbdell> jquery has specific ajax get function
[04:50:28] <dumbdell> has a^
[04:51:12] <zissou> i can have a short script doing what i want and that one being called with ajax
[04:51:38] <zissou> that script being in a different file
[04:51:48] <Baseer> Help Plz,
[04:52:09] <amaroks> Baseer:  can you put your code on jsfiddle.net
[04:52:09] <Baseer> how can I deactivate one tab in tabbed navigation,
[04:52:27] <zissou> i was wondering... how do people use ajax to logout? they have a script that does that on the server side which is called with ajax right?
[04:52:38] <Baseer> Well, it's very simple, I have copied form Bootstrap website,
[04:53:00] <amaroks> Baseer:  without seeing code no one will be able to help you
[04:53:21] <amaroks> zissou: the same way you logout without ajax, call a URL that destroys session
[04:53:28] <Baseer> <ul class="nav nav-tabs" id="myTab">
[04:53:29] <Baseer>   <li class="active"><a href="#home">Home</a></li>

[04:53:34] <Baseer>   <li><a href="#settings">Settings</a></li>
[04:53:35] <Baseer> </ul>
[04:53:37] <Baseer>  
[04:53:38] <Baseer> <div class="tab-content">
[04:53:40] <Baseer>   <div class="tab-pane active" id="home">...</div>

[04:53:46] <Baseer> </div>
[04:53:47] <Baseer>  
[04:53:49] <Baseer> <script>
[04:53:50] <tra> please don't paste to the channel ever again
[04:53:50] <Baseer>   $(function () {
[04:53:52] <Baseer>     $('#myTab a:last').tab('show');
[04:53:52] <hXm> dafuq
[04:53:53] <Baseer>   })
[04:53:55] <Baseer> </script>
[04:54:08] <zissou> amaroks, i needed to hear that from smn here to be sure... tnx
[04:54:46] <amaroks> zissou: he will most likely tell you same thing, you will see
[04:54:52] <Baseer> Ok,
[04:54:54] <Baseer> http://jsfiddle.net/FZwnJ/
[04:54:57] <zissou> isnt there a bot that puts guys like baseer into order?
[04:55:22] <zissou> amaroks, you said it? im confused.. and that's fineeee
[04:55:48] <zissou> isnt that what baseer just did called flooding?
[04:56:51] <amaroks> zissou: No, maybe new to IRC chat and he didnt know about jsfiddle or any other sites
[04:57:21] <amaroks> Baseer: You need to include bootstrap jquery plugin and you are also missing some CSS
[04:57:23] <Baseer> I know what jsfiddle is,
[04:57:40] <Baseer> yes, I have included in my local files,
[04:57:48] <Baseer> the question is very simple,
[04:57:56] <Baseer> it doesn't need too much dialog,
[04:57:59] <amaroks> Baseer: We don't see your local files, if its simple then solve it...
[04:58:25] <Baseer> how can I deactivate a tab?
[04:58:30] <zissou> i can see his local files 3:)
[05:00:20] <zissou> Baseer, removeClass('active')?
[05:01:03] <Baseer> No, I want to disable the tab,
[05:02:16] <zissou> $('.tab-content').eq(?).remove() ?
[05:02:29] <zissou> or addClass('disabled')
[05:02:35] <amaroks> Ba
[05:02:40] <zissou> where you put visibility hidden
[05:02:42] <miCSu> quitted already
[05:02:45] <zissou> or display none
[05:02:49] <zissou> aha
[05:03:02] <zissou> i see that now
[05:03:26] <zissou> i think he was a prick

[05:26:46] <zorro__> Any jQuery mobile developers here? :)

[05:57:13] <Nytician> Hi there, I'm having an issue with text appearence in my canvas any idea whats causing it to stretch? : http://img9.imageshack.us/img9/4893/issue.png
[06:01:28] <JohnnyCash^^^> Got a question: I want to build  a little script in jQuery that the end-user can pick 2 colors for a stripes shirt and change them. Any idea how to do that?
[06:01:41] <JohnnyCash^^^> jQuery/JS*
[06:08:32] <peder> JohnnyCash^^^: maybe http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/ ?
[06:09:23] <JohnnyCash^^^> peder: picking colors is not the problem
[06:09:24] <Famic> is there a shortcut to get all attributes starting with a specific string ?
[06:10:34] <peder> JohnnyCash^^^: then, what is?
[06:10:51] <JohnnyCash^^^> peder: http://palletown.net/tf/tf/check.png
[06:11:02] <JohnnyCash^^^> i want to do like: 1&3 = white, 2&4 = black
[06:11:29] <SDr> any suggestions on how to disable browser-side javascript injection into the page?
[06:15:35] <peder> JohnnyCash^^^: guess loading the image in a canvas and then use the canvas drawing routines to fill the sections
[06:15:54] <peder> http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/tutorials/html5-canvas-shape-fill/
[06:17:10] <JohnnyCash^^^> the thing is that i have a few examples of shirts and i can't set waypoints to each of them
[06:27:05] <peder> JohnnyCash^^^: found this link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10069171/canvas-change-colors-of-an-image-using-html5-css-jshttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/10069171/canvas-change-colors-of-an-image-using-html5-css-js
[06:27:12] <peder> sorry.. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10069171/canvas-change-colors-of-an-image-using-html5-css-js
[06:27:40] <peder> not sure if it helps directly, but its a start
[06:28:03] <freannrak> I'm trying to get the next/prev input field to show when a link is clicked, but it only displays 1 fields because the prev() doesn't get me the the correct element. Should I loop all inputFields and check for the display:none? http://jsfiddle.net/erkarl/EbNnE/14/
[06:34:42] <Nytician> to do text with javascript, like user input do I have to code it myself to check what keys are pressed etc?
[06:55:49] <lobbin> Any idea to fix our performance problem we're seeing with checkboxes inside list views?
[06:56:04] <lobbin> I did a jsfiddle describing the problem: http://jsfiddle.net/bZYJq/22/
[07:01:46] <mintux> i have string array that i want sort them depends on case sensitive how could i do that ?
[07:07:03] <mintux> ok i found sort() and it works for me
[07:11:11] <c4ptnh00k> lobbin: I looked into your code and to help with performance to you mean load time?
[07:11:14] <houser> Why is the defaultOptions undefined? http://jsfiddle.net/jyXqN/ ?
[07:13:46] <c4ptnh00k> houser missing a semicolon?
[07:13:49] <shoky> houser:  this.defaultOptions = {};    'this' is just the jquery object that you ran .pluginname() of
[07:13:59] <shoky> that's not what you wanna do
[07:14:37] <houser> shoky, what is a better way to do it?

[07:15:31] <shoky> no, no
[07:15:38] <shoky> very bad
[07:16:12] <shoky> especially not putting 'var' before 'self' that's just asking for trouble
[07:16:35] <c4ptnh00k> nuke the global scope
[07:16:56] <BillCriswell> pew pew

[07:21:26] <lsfc1914> I have buttons (each with id) and information in paragraph (also each with id) for each of the buttons. I want when clicking on a button to show/hide the related paragraph. How can I do this for all the buttons no matter how many are they?
[07:24:21] <oliveiraev> do with classes, or data-attributes
[07:24:23] <dabear> lsfc1914: http://api.jquery.com/delegate/ for handing events on all buttons. inside that event handler, "this" refers to the current button. so $(this).parent().find("p:first").show() might do what yo uwant. remember, just an aexample, ha to be adopted to work on your site..
[07:24:35] <oliveiraev> <button data-toggle="target-id">
[07:25:14] <oliveiraev> $('button[data-toggle]').click(function () { var target = $(this).data('toggle'); $('#' + target).toggle(); });
[07:25:23] <dabear> man, my spelling was way off there
[07:26:01] <c4ptnh00k> dabear: can you show us an aexample? lol j/k
[07:26:08] <BillCriswell> Ir you could just  make data-target a selector string so you don't need to append the '#' and it leaves it open to plenty of possibilities.
[07:26:30] <dabear> c4ptnh00k: can you at least _try_ your self
[07:26:34] <BillCriswell> s/Ir/or
[07:26:53] <dabear> I hate it when people expect others to do their work for them
[07:27:09] <c4ptnh00k> Agreed
[07:27:47] <BillCriswell> Doing other peoples work is the only fun I have at work.
[07:27:57] <BillCriswell> Don't take this from meeeee
[07:28:17] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: careful using #selectors everywhere as it can make managing elements invasive
[07:28:56] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: disregard I just got what you were saying
[07:29:24] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: 'tis all good.
[07:29:27] <c4ptnh00k> sorry still early hear so eyes and ears not quite functioning all the way yet
[07:29:34] <c4ptnh00k> hrer
[07:29:36] <EdwardIII> don't suppose anyone can point me in the direction of a plugin that lets you see a stack trace for JS errors? i'm seeing something that looks like a call to use a normal DOM object like a jQuery object, but no clue where that's happening
[07:29:38] <c4ptnh00k> here dang it
[07:29:54] <EdwardIII> IE just points me to the line in jQuery core where it's trying to use the object heh
[07:30:04] <c4ptnh00k> EdwardIII what browser to you develop in?
[07:30:16] <EdwardIII> sorry i meant in IE
[07:31:16] <c4ptnh00k> well I suggest using chrome or ff. In Chrome dev tools will allow you to step through each js and in ff I use firebug(does the same) Im not sure what IE has to offer
[07:31:25] <dabear> EdwardIII: maybe firebug lite is better there, dunno
[07:31:45] <dabear> firebug lite works in IE
[07:32:07] <c4ptnh00k> well there you have it
[07:32:08] <EdwardIII> awesome, i'll check it out
[07:32:14] <EdwardIII> dabear: problem only occurs in IE
[07:32:24] <EdwardIII> that wonderful little gem of a web browser
[07:32:42] <dabear> EdwardIII: DID YOU READ WHAT I WROTE?
[07:32:53] <c4ptnh00k> lol
[07:33:01] <BillCriswell> EdwardIII: A trailing , is usually what bites me in the ass luckily.
[07:33:04] <EdwardIII> dabear: YES
[07:33:14] <dabear> EdwardIII: <dabear> firebug lite works in IE
[07:33:17] <EdwardIII> dabear: apologies, that previous comment was meant for c4ptnh00k
[07:33:38] <c4ptnh00k> wait what?
[07:33:46] <EdwardIII> BillCriswell: yeah i've seen that plenty too, doesn't seem to be the case here though, it's not a syntax error
[07:33:55] <BillCriswell> Ah.
[07:34:10] <c4ptnh00k> that makes no sense... o.O
[07:34:15] <Kn|t3> not particularly a jquery question, but I am asking since I could not get much help in other channels.
[07:34:16] <Kn|t3> http://jsfiddle.net/h6zCN/1/
[07:34:31] <Kn|t3> why does this does not allows me to focus the child div "world"
[07:34:48] <Kn|t3> ** this not **
[07:35:19] <c4ptnh00k> well its a css propblem in which you have to chain your selectors for child elements
[07:36:01] <BillCriswell> Kn|t3: I'm assuming since .t is no longer the focus there's no way it can focus on .p
[07:36:04] <c4ptnh00k> not really a jquery question but http://stackoverflow.com/questions/632100/apply-css-style-to-child-elements
[07:36:52] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: Not sure you understood that question either. :-p
[07:37:03] <Kn|t3> BillCriswell: Sorry? but tabIndex is set, right? so the focus should travel correctly, no?
[07:37:26] <BillCriswell> If it's not visible I couldn't imagine it would? I'd have to play with that a lot.
[07:37:40] <Kn|t3> it is visible when parent is focused.
[07:37:50] <c4ptnh00k> wait.. He said that child elements not getting focus right?
[07:38:00] <Kn|t3> it has something to do with visibility I know - i just cannot put my finger on it.
[07:38:08] <Kn|t3> FYI, http://jsfiddle.net/h6zCN/2/ works.
[07:39:22] <Kn|t3> c4ptnh00k: right.
[07:44:37] <BillCriswell> Kn|t3: http://jsfiddle.net/h6zCN/7/
[07:45:11] <BillCriswell> I think c4ptnh00k was actually leading you down the right path, I just read wrong... it's also early here!
[07:45:49] <c4ptnh00k> ty
[07:46:12] <Kn|t3> BillCriswell: Thanks! Can't believe I was doing such a mistake. Anyways, looks like it still fails in Firefox :(
[07:46:36] <BillCriswell> I wish I could trust that :focus stuff a little more ahha
[07:47:06] <Kn|t3> BillCriswell: Is there a better way? I don't want event listeners on FOCUS.
[07:47:19] <c4ptnh00k> TONS of options
[07:47:42] <Kn|t3> c4ptnh00k: which of them?
[07:48:14] <c4ptnh00k> if you use jquery I'd suggest using click. then you can pass in arguments based on situation
[07:48:32] <c4ptnh00k> css is powerful, but not programmatic
[07:48:49] <c4ptnh00k> sort of an all or nothing sometimes
[07:49:15] <Kn|t3> c4ptnh00k: I would really want to avoid the event listeners for things like focus.
[07:49:56] <Kn|t3> c4ptnh00k: btw, click won't really work if I focus by keyboard.
[07:50:07] <screamingbanshee> perhaps the target or targetRelated of the event right before it
[07:51:23] <Kn|t3> btw I find that setting opacity might work - its a hack but works for my case.
[07:51:37] <Kn|t3> opacity:1 when :focs
[07:51:39] <Kn|t3> :focus*
[07:52:07] <c4ptnh00k> one way or another it will have to based on some sort of event handler
[07:52:28] <c4ptnh00k> either focus or hover or w/e
[07:52:50] <Kn|t3> c4ptnh00k: true - browser is doing it already, attaching another event handler looks heavy to me.
[07:53:16] <Kn|t3> c4ptnh00k: anyways, I think I will go with the opacity thing for now and come back if I face issue again :)
[07:53:20] <Kn|t3> Thanks c4ptnh00k and BillCriswell
[07:53:29] <BillCriswell> Kn|t3: No problem.
[07:53:32] <c4ptnh00k> np
[07:54:59] <c4ptnh00k> you have to stay focused ...
[07:58:11] <FrameFever> how can I retrieve margin-left?
[07:58:16] <FrameFever> the current value
[07:59:19] <c4ptnh00k> http://api.jquery.com/css/
[07:59:44] <c4ptnh00k> FrameFever: That should answer everything
[08:00:16] <xnotte> how can i cycle throw the first value of the row ? like row[0] ? http://jsfiddle.net/kXvRu/
[08:01:31] <FrameFever> ohh I can directly call css("margin-left")? I thought I have to use $("div").outerWidth(true) -  $("div").innerWidth()
[08:02:43] <c4ptnh00k> pretty much
[08:04:26] <FrameFever> c4ptnh00k: I need to get the calculated value of the margin-left
[08:04:48] <FrameFever> css("margin-left") this will return a "100px" I can not to calculation with this
[08:06:05] <c4ptnh00k> $(elem).css('marginLeft') <-- should give you the rendered margin left for the element
[08:07:10] <FrameFever> c4ptnh00k: this seemst to be still a string value returing
[08:07:16] <FrameFever> how can I get a number value?
[08:07:27] <clov3r> parseInt( val )
[08:07:57] <c4ptnh00k> it is a number px is a unit of messure just parse it if you dont want it added

[08:11:15] <FrameFever> c4ptnh00k: how can I convert it to a number?
[08:11:49] <clov3r> Framefever: parseInt( $(elem).css('marginLeft') )
[08:12:06] <c4ptnh00k> FrameFever: look up parsing. something like * $(elem).css('marginLeft') *
[08:12:25] <FrameFever> look up parsing?
[08:12:30] <c4ptnh00k> well yeah listen to clov3r
[08:12:38] <FrameFever> clov3r: is the margin value always a integer?
[08:12:43] <FrameFever> or can it be also a float value?
[08:13:01] <Blubsi> yeah my explanations suck sometimes ^^,alright so there's a page with several divs,those divs havean an id or class.What I do atm is navigate to those divs with scrollTop: $(".wrapper").eq($this.index()).offset().top,now I want to check if the user is on top of a div and change the background-image of body
[08:13:24] <clov3r> yep it can be a float.
[08:13:32] <c4ptnh00k> its a number
[08:13:33] <clov3r> but it'll render as an int
[08:13:40] <c4ptnh00k> it can be whatever you want it to be
[08:13:48] <clov3r> because there's only a finite number of pixels
[08:14:19] <clov3r> but you can parseFloat() too if that's your cuppa tea
[08:15:24] <FrameFever> c4ptnh00k: where can I find this information, that there is a difference betwenn css("margin-left") and css("marginLeft"); ?
[08:15:56] <clov3r> Blubsi: $( '#yourdiv' ).on("mouseenter", function() {..})?
[08:15:59] <c4ptnh00k> Bulbsi: look herer first http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12392669/how-to-determine-if-top-of-div-is-within-screen-view-using-jquery
[08:16:24] <Blubsi> Ty c4ptnh00k
[08:17:03] <c4ptnh00k> this is if you just want to know if the div is within the viewable area of the screen maybe you can use that.
[08:17:42] <Blubsi> yeah that's what i was looking for :)
[08:18:28] <c4ptnh00k> Bulbsi: Glad I could help with my impecable google skilz
[08:18:39] <Blubsi> c4ptnh00k my google skills suck
[08:18:51] <BillCriswell> Meeting are just getting worse and worse.
[08:18:52] <Blubsi> can't find shit if I search for it :D
[08:19:17] <c4ptnh00k> Bulbsi: saaalgood
[08:19:32] <clov3r> BillCriswell: or you're getting smarter and smarter... making the meetings all the more unbearable :p
[08:19:38] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: my company banned me from meetings lol
[08:20:04] <Blubsi> lol
[08:20:14] <Blubsi> my company's meetings are when we all go out to smoke
[08:20:30] <clov3r> c4ptnh00k: any tips? :D
[08:20:37] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: I was excused for a while fro them as well. It was a beautiful time.
[08:21:12] <c4ptnh00k> clov3r: Confuse them lol. That generally works for me. THen just get your work done.
[08:21:39] <wilkinsmc> fuck
[08:21:44] <wilkinsmc> of course my site only works in IE 9
[08:21:47] <wilkinsmc> not IE 8
[08:21:53] <wilkinsmc> it's not rotating things at all
[08:21:56] <wilkinsmc> son of a penis
[08:21:57] <BillCriswell> clov3r: I don't mind meetings as long as they pertain to me. When I'm in a meeting for a half hour and I'm not involved in anything it's just pointless.
[08:22:14] <clov3r> oh yeah
[08:22:18] <clov3r> i feel ya buddy
[08:22:27] <deepy> wilkinsmc: http://devopsreactions.tumblr.com/post/49501668537/testing-interface-on-internet-explorer
[08:22:36] <wilkinsmc> ie8 comes installed on every i7 installation standard
[08:22:40] <wilkinsmc> i'm basicall screwed
[08:22:47] <wilkinsmc> i wonder if there's an easy way to fix it
[08:22:52] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: I get a lot of "we need to listen to you more" followed by a whole lot of not listening.
[08:22:54] <wilkinsmc> maybe IE has its own way of rotating
[08:23:22] <wilkinsmc> lol
[08:23:40] * clov3r chuckles
[08:23:44] <clov3r> sounds like my wife
[08:24:57] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: That's about the truth. I spend far too much time explaining in meetings. I prefer doing so one day I just raised my hand and said, " Can I get some work done?"
[08:25:55] <c4ptnh00k> dang punctuation
[08:26:03] <c4ptnh00k> doing,
[08:27:07] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: My boss would be so pissed if I did that.
[08:27:46] <c4ptnh00k> Eh then my friend you are in a marriage
[08:28:28] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: Haha, sure feels lke that sometimes.
[08:32:20] <wilkinsmc> shit
[08:32:24] <wilkinsmc> it won't even load in ie7
[08:32:38] <wilkinsmc> i'm going to make a page that tells people to update their ie if they have 7
[08:32:40] <wilkinsmc> becuase wth
[08:33:33] <xnotte> how can i cycle throw the first value of the row ? like row[0] ? http://jsfiddle.net/kXvRu/
[08:37:22] <clov3r> xnotte: i'm not sure, but i would recommend trying it with real test data...
[08:38:45] <xnotte> clov3r i'm trying with real data, but i can't pass it all to jsfiddle. i tried row[0] but doesnt work

[09:08:37] <Wamer> i need to ignore all other touch events except the one i want currently ..
[09:08:49] <c4ptnh00k> wamer: blur()

[09:21:54] <anli> Is it possible to create a client side image picker?
[09:24:22] <Joe_____> Hey all, I need some advice. I am working with table data and i want to be able to click a <td> and use the value of the td later, how can i store the value of the <td> so i can do a $('tr').hide and then a $('tr:contains(clickedValue)').show()?
[09:25:05] <clov3r> Joe: just store the value in a variable?
[09:25:32] <wilkinsmc> can't seem to set a css value only for ie8
[09:25:40] <wilkinsmc> addclass doesn't seem to change anything
[09:25:49] <kjy112> hello
[09:25:57] <anli> Hm, would be nice to read files directly from disk into <img> tags
[09:26:11] <Joe_____> clov3r: I tried that but I guess i don't know how to store/set the variable correctly
[09:26:15] <clov3r> var data; $('td').click(function() {data = $(this).text();});
[09:26:16] <kjy112> anyone knows an image transformation script that works off transforming the image?
[09:26:55] <lord4163> Hello!
[09:26:56] <Eviltwin> I would imagine that image tranformations would be accomplished by transforming an image.
[09:26:57] <Joe_____> clov3r: i will try that, I tried something very similar but not exact
[09:27:08] <kjy112> interactions transformation
[09:27:21] <kjy112> there is draggable, droppable, resizable, selectable, and sortable
[09:27:24] <kjy112> no transformable
[09:27:49] <Eviltwin> Well transform is about 100x more vague than any of those others
[09:27:59] <Eviltwin> Can you be any more specific?
[09:28:01] <kjy112> i am sorry
[09:28:05] <kjy112> more of Rotatable
[09:28:07] <kjy112> blah
[09:28:22] <kjy112> similar to this https://code.google.com/p/jqueryrotate/downloads/detail?name=jQueryRotateCompressed.2.2.js&can=2&q=
[09:28:30] <Eviltwin> But not that?
[09:28:39] <kjy112> but looking for something that has the similar effect as the jQuery UI's resizable
[09:28:54] <NickNack> I have somewhat of a problem im not sure how to solve it, but im using jquery ui slider and I have 3 different values on the slider 15 30 and 40, when the slider is at 30 the handle doesnt land in the middle, it looks like its at about 60% but if i changed my max value of 40 to 45 the handler lands in the middle. Any suggestions how I can go about making this in the middle without changing my max value? http://jsbin.com/ayabad/2/edit
[09:29:14] <kjy112> where you literally able to resize off an image by clicking on right corner, but instead for rotatble
[09:29:24] <kjy112> maybe i am not explaining it correctly
[09:29:59] <Joe_____> clov3r: Thanks! that was easy...I just brain farted that one is all....I was doing that and trying to verify it worked in console by doing a console.log(data) but i was putting the console.log(data) after the click function instead of inside of it, and then wondering why it was undefined, lol
[09:30:37] <Eviltwin> NickNack: http://jsbin.com/ayabad/4/edit
[09:30:57] <bambu> var ret = frames['upload_target'].document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0].innerHTML;
[09:31:04] <bambu> That in jquery would be:
[09:31:43] <NickNack> Eviltwin: ahh, thanks man
[09:33:54] <clov3r> bambu: not sure about frames; but document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0].innerHTML; would be $('body').eq(0).html();
[09:33:59] <bambu> Iget a permission denied,\
[09:34:27] <clov3r> and i reckon the eq(0) is unnecessary, as there is only likely to be one body...
[09:34:36] <bambu> $('#ut').contents()    where #ut is an iframe
[09:35:38] <bambu> I think it violates  same origin policy ?
[09:36:10] <clov3r> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/364952/jquery-javascript-accessing-contents-of-an-iframe
[09:37:02] <bambu> http://www.openjs.com/articles/ajax/ajax_file_upload/response_data.php
[09:37:34] <bambu> I set the form's target to the iframe, which actually works pretty well!
[09:37:53] <bambu> Now when I try to retrieve the response, I get error.
[09:38:03] <clov3r> ...
[09:38:06] <wilkinsmc> mother fucking ie 8
[09:38:12] <wilkinsmc> i need to style it and nothing else
[09:38:18] <wilkinsmc> but -msfilter doesn't work with jquery?
[09:38:19] <wilkinsmc> FUCKJKK
[09:38:25] <bambu> The reason I'm doing all of this is because cross domain doesn't work with AJAX, as in POST to a.domain.com from domain.com
[09:38:33] <clov3r> as in you post the form submit to the iframe url?
[09:38:47] <clov3r> yep
[09:38:51] <clov3r> proxy?
[09:38:56] <bambu> ;P
[09:39:12] <bambu> No httpd.conf access
[09:39:38] <bambu> but for some reason he got it to work, i guess the browsers implemented stricter security?
[09:40:00] <bambu> Even his code returns error :p
[09:40:52] <clov3r> can you use a php script to forward the cross-domain request?
[09:41:34] <clov3r> that'll give you a performance hit probably, but haven't heard of another way yet...
[09:41:40] <bambu> The setup us basically domain.com and dynamic.domain.com where domain.com is completly static Apache server.
[09:42:16] <clov3r> change the setup to domain.com/dynamic ?
[09:42:42] <bambu> As in Apache proxy or rewrites?
[09:44:58] <clov3r> something like that maybe
[09:45:07] <clov3r> it's not really a jquery issue any more
[09:45:25] <bambu> :)
[09:45:38] <bambu> I'm sticking to a Jquery solution
[09:46:53] <clov3r> well then you'll need to find a way to mirror the cross-domain request
[09:49:04] <bakers> Is there a way to set the css display of an element to the default for that tag type?
[09:49:09] <bakers> i.e. inline, block, etc
[09:49:28] <wilkinsmc> i hope my site will work with back versions of chrome and firefox. Only tested with new ones.
[09:49:30] <tripflex> inherit ?
[09:49:49] <c4ptnh00k> Bakers just use the tag selector
[09:50:10] <tripflex> wilkinsmc, browsershots.org
[09:50:24] <c4ptnh00k> div { param:value;}
[09:52:06] <wilkinsmc> in your experience, does chrome and firefox have good legacy support for the last sixish years?
[09:52:24] <wilkinsmc> already had to jump through hoops for new version of ff
[09:52:28] <tripflex> eh 6 years geez
[09:52:38] <tripflex> normally ff and chrome support is good
[09:52:40] <tripflex> it's IE that sucks balls
[09:53:10] <wilkinsmc> nice
[09:53:22] <wilkinsmc> ya, having to do deal with matrix to rotate in ie 8
[09:53:31] <wilkinsmc> and also had to search for an hour to get rid of black background on pngs
[09:53:37] <wilkinsmc> after already uploading my site live
[09:53:38] <wilkinsmc> lol
[09:53:49] <wilkinsmc> IE Doesn't work good locally for some reason
[09:53:58] <wilkinsmc> activex nonsense and throwing variable errors
[09:54:09] <pfFredd> I'm making a simple web app that needs to remember the users, would making anonymous userid's with a related uuid in the database and storing this uuid in local storage on the device be a good strategy to do this? As it's so simple and to keep it straight forward I want to avoid all the user login-stuff
[09:56:54] <xnotte> clov3r i'm trying with real data, but i can't pass it all to jsfiddle. i tried row[0] but doesnt work
[09:57:10] <xnotte> how can i cycle throw the first value of the row ? like row[0] ? http://jsfiddle.net/kXvRu/
[09:58:27] <clov3r> xnotte:write up a working jsfiddle where data is defined
[09:58:43] <wilkinsmc> I hope my SEO doesn't get penalized for having a partially working site
[10:03:32] <wcabral> hey, quick question (hopefully).. way to make a containers height adjust when you show or hide a <div>?
[10:03:49] <c4ptnh00k> wilkinsmc: whats your IE problem and how does it pertain to jquery. I will try to help
[10:04:30] <c4ptnh00k> wcabral: are you looking for the slide method?
[10:05:17] <wcabral> I have some simple code that when you check 'yes' on the radio button it reveals a div. But once it slides to reveal content it pops back to the original size leaving the new content out of the container
[10:05:49] <wcabral> I'm already using the slideToggle method, just need to have the container adjust
[10:06:35] <c4ptnh00k> so you are saying your outer/parent container is not resizing?
[10:06:46] <wcabral> yeah
[10:07:14] <wcabral> Be better to make you a jsfiddle?
[10:07:37] <c4ptnh00k> add this before the close tag of your parent div <div style="clear:both;"></div>
[10:08:18] <c4ptnh00k> that fix it?
[10:08:48] <wcabral> putting it in now, one sec
[10:09:41] <wcabral> no, still popping back to original height
[10:10:00] <c4ptnh00k> yup then we need some jsfiddle
[10:10:55] <wcabral> http://jsfiddle.net/eaNr8/
[10:11:16] <wcabral> There's the fiddle (apologies for the sloppiness)
[10:11:19] <insel> a very basic question, but i cant google it because i havent the right keywords: "how can i change a <p> by using the page in order to "adress" it?" p.e.: $('#my_p').text('new text'); on <section id="page1" data-role="page">
[10:11:33] <wcabral> So if you click sign up now under the
[10:11:39] <wcabral> "Priority
[10:12:03] <wcabral>  Click on "Are you located outside of the US?"  and it will pop
[10:15:05] <Hmmz> Hello World!
[10:15:11] <Hmmz> Does anyone use BaseX?
[10:17:17] <c4ptnh00k> wcabral: http://jsfiddle.net/c4ptnh00k/FeyUQ/
[10:17:45] <c4ptnh00k> adding what I told you to fixed it. You must have put it in the wrong container
[10:17:48] <Hmmz> I'm just wondering how to test XPath with BaseX.
[10:19:41] <wcabral> you are awesome :)
[10:19:45] <wcabral> thank you very much
[10:19:54] <c4ptnh00k> no problem man
[10:20:16] <c4ptnh00k> the slided div just needed a place to live
[10:20:37] <madabyss> Hey Guys. I have input mask setup on a phone number field. I'm loading content via ajax and defining the mask $("input#phone").mask(bla); in the orginal content document ready function. Mask isn't working. Thoughts?
[10:21:58] <wcabral> I coulda sworn I put it where you did.
[10:22:15] <wcabral> Either way, much appreciated
[10:22:42] <c4ptnh00k> no problem man
[10:24:02] <bambu> lol
[10:25:16] <bambu> I'm not sure if its Firefox only, but you can use document.domain=domain.com;  on sub.domain.com and domain.com to allow cross domain requests and DOM access :p
[10:31:15] <jimi_> Can I get .load() to follow a 302
[10:34:25] <jimi_> or, can i use a full url like http://foobar/baz
[10:35:02] <motaka2> Is it possible to use $.when with an array of functions ?
[10:38:30] <BillCriswell> motaka2: Yeah, check out .apply
[10:39:10] <BillCriswell> motaka2: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4878887/how-do-you-work-with-an-array-of-jquery-deferreds should help a lot
[10:40:44] <motaka2> BillCriswell: I dont understand anything from deffereds callback etc I hav an array of javascript urls and I want to load them using $.ajax with caching true, and then use the ajax retrived html in the same request as I get the js paths, is that possible with $.when ?
[10:42:18] <BillCriswell> motaka2: Do you want to do something with the response from EACH or them or wait till they're all complete then do something?
[10:42:48] <BillCriswell> from EACH of them*
[10:44:48] <motaka2> BillCriswell: I want them to be all loaded and then do something with it - that means I send an ajax request to the server in response I get a json of with three (or four) elements: 1. array of css urls 2. array of js urls 3.html 4. inline js that need those js urls loaded first
[10:45:55] <patrickod> is there a way to attach .ajaxError for cross domain requests? I'm trying to catch errors but neither the error: callback in .ajax or .ajaxError are being called it seems.
[10:46:15] <patrickod> or rather I can't seem to silence the error showing up in the javascript console
[10:48:08] <c4ptnh00k> um have you looked into unobtrusive validation?
[10:48:12] <wilkinsmc> they should have a show at the county fair called the amazing cross-browser compatability guy
[10:48:46] <c4ptnh00k> ... cross-browser? or cross-generation
[10:49:18] <wilkinsmc> it's just crazy to me that you have to jump through hoops to get opacity to work in ie8
[10:49:19] <c4ptnh00k> because it is my opinion that anyone who writes for ie7 are responsible to why it still exists lol
[10:49:29] <c4ptnh00k> or ie8 for that matter
[10:49:35] <wilkinsmc> i'm hoping i don't have to make my site work with it
[10:49:44] <wilkinsmc> i don't think many people still use it, right?
[10:49:56] <motaka2> BillCriswell: Are you there ?
[10:49:57] <wilkinsmc> ie7 came out in 2006
[10:50:10] <wilkinsmc> so i guess if people are on xp and never upgraded their IE :/
[10:50:15] <wilkinsmc> which is possible for my customer base
[10:50:15] <c4ptnh00k> they use it because stuff still works on it. you take that away and people stop using it
[10:50:31] <wilkinsmc> well, not immediately
[10:50:38] <BillCriswell> motaka2: So you do /get/1.json, /get/2.json, /get/3.json and from each response of those you want to add some elemts to an array for you to do things with?
[10:50:39] <c4ptnh00k> eh close enough
[10:51:13] <motaka2> BillCriswell: lemme show you some code
[10:51:37] <c4ptnh00k> point is I shouldnt be held back on developing html5 pages with css3 and jquery just because people are "reluctant" to upgrade
[10:52:25] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: Would be nice to say "fuck those people" for sure.
[10:52:57] <myosotis> not everybody that uses IE is clueless =/ some are simply unfortunate
[10:53:09] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: I wish that we could, I wish we could
[10:53:33] <c4ptnh00k> myosotis: I have no problem with ie9/10
[10:53:43] <BillCriswell> Yeah, it's typically not their choice to stick with legacy IE.
[10:53:54] <BillCriswell> I should use IE5.5 just for fun.
[10:54:03] <c4ptnh00k> oh god
[10:54:34] <c4ptnh00k> i think i just heard a tear drop from some retired developper because someone thought of his product
[10:54:47] <BillCriswell> haha i've debugged IE5.5
[10:55:02] <BillCriswell> Darkest times of my life.
[10:55:08] <BillCriswell> And that was just HTML & CSS.
[10:55:33] <c4ptnh00k> i'm not "new" to this game, but I have to say that would be before me.
[10:55:34] <myosotis> I feel the same as most of the people in here... but going back to the dark ages on occasion is unfortunately the nature of this sort of work
[10:56:11] <c4ptnh00k> well I am about to embark on one of the most satisfying parts of my work day.
[10:56:18] <c4ptnh00k> lunch
[10:56:23] <c4ptnh00k> cyall in a few
[10:56:35] <rael> cya
[10:56:36] <BillCriswell> have a ood one.
[10:56:41] <BillCriswell> good eve
[10:56:44] <BillCriswell> even*
[10:58:23] <BillCriswell> I have this script I need to run... and I'm just delaying it cause if it doesn't work completely I'm going to punch myself in the face.
[10:59:03] <clov3r> backup
[10:59:19] <clov3r> just backup everything
[10:59:40] <BillCriswell> clov3r: I can't even destroy anything. I just don't want to see an error haha
[10:59:59] <clov3r> oh well if that's all...
[11:00:18] <clov3r> quit belly-aching :P
[11:00:24] <BillCriswell> EXACTLY.
[11:00:27] <BillCriswell> Ok, I'm going to do it.
[11:00:39] <clov3r> what's it do?
[11:00:40] <clov3r> :P
[11:00:44] <BillCriswell> I hope 20,000 API requests are enough cause i don't feel like putting in code to throttle it
[11:00:55] <Pavlov> i have a case where an image might error out/fail to load because of the network going down or app suspension happening -- whats the best way to re-load that image on resume?
[11:00:59] <BillCriswell> moves from products from a CSV into a bigcommerce store using their API.
[11:01:20] <BillCriswell> I tested it on a product and it worked well... but the data in the CSV makes me nervous.
[11:01:38] <Pavlov> just $("img").each(function(i,e) { if (!e.complete) { e.src=e.src }}) or somesuch?
[11:01:44] <clov3r> good luck
[11:02:18] <BillCriswell> Ah just remembered something I need to add to it.
[11:03:11] <vsync_> shine on you
[11:03:41] <clov3r> pavlov: seems like it would work... but i read something the other day about safari not supporting .complete...
[11:03:52] <clov3r> not too sure about that tho
[11:04:07] <Pavlov> ah, hm
[11:04:23] <Pavlov> this is in a phonegap app, basically trying to fix a race against app suspend
[11:06:27] <Pavlov> looks like it is there now
[11:07:29] <wilkinsmc> so only like 1% of people use ie7
[11:08:04] <wilkinsmc> think i'm just going to point people using ie7 to an html page that says, "upgrade your Internet explorer to the newest version before viewing this site. You'll be glad you did"
[11:08:14] <wilkinsmc> or something like that
[11:08:39] <clov3r> wilkinsmc: where do you come up with these flashes of brilliance?
[11:09:35] <wilkinsmc> I feel like a modern day thomas edison
[11:32:23] <5EXAANRUK> Hey everyone, I am running into an issue where I am making a method call above the method definition in my js file.  In Chrome, the js runs without issue but in Firefox it throws an error saying "method x is not defined."  So it seems like Chrome is somehow loading the entire js file and then executing method calls where Firefox is executing the file top to bottom without an initial load.  https://gist.github.com/louism2/5614220
[11:32:49] <lord4163> Does anyone know why I am getting this error? Uncaught TypeError: Property 'location' of object [object global] is not a function. The page doesn't fully load either. I'm using the window.location js function.
[11:32:50] <5EXAANRUK> How should I think about this fact?  Is firefox "correct" or is chrome "correct"?
[11:45:03] <bakers> Is there a way to get SCREEN resolution, vs Window resolution?
[11:45:13] <bakers> I want to see if my users are running their browsers maximized or not
[11:45:17] <azazel91> can somesome suggest a good wysiwygi html editor for a forums im doing
[11:51:58] <amaroks_> bakers: tried screen.width?
[11:54:19] <BillCriswell> screen.width vs window.innerWidth could work.. but you may need to account for scroll bars and shit.
[11:54:37] <jimi_>  when i remove the break on line 26, this code stops working, can someone help me diagnose it? http://pastie.org/7935878
[11:54:39] <hexacode> anyone know if i can animate to a named css selector from my css file?
[11:54:39] <azazel91> anyone know of a good text editor for a forums
[11:55:17] <BillCriswell> hexacode: jQuery UI has something for that built in I believe.
[11:55:37] <BillCriswell> hexacode: http://jqueryui.com/toggleClass/ I think this is what you're asking for atleast.
[11:55:43] <hexacode> thanks
[11:56:17] <ccmonster> hey folks, question: I have a twitter bootstrap page, that has tabs. Each tab has some buttons. I want to check that all my button groups have something selected, and if so, proceed to the next tab
[11:56:40] <ccmonster> not sure what the best process to check this on click is
[12:00:34] <hXm> hello, someone know where can i ask about tinymce for jquery or javascript?
[12:02:07] <BillCriswell> ccmonster: So you start on tab one, you make sure something is actually checked, then go to tab 2?
[12:02:15] <ccmonster> yea.
[12:02:43] <ccmonster> basically, i think the flow should be, on click, check if all btn groups have something filled, and if so, proceed to next tab
[12:03:09] <Synthead> how can I make an event handler run a function that already exists?  I'm going to pass a str to the function too
[12:03:28] <BillCriswell> ccmonster: http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#event-beforeActivate looks like a good place to put the logic into.
[12:03:34] <bambu> Hi
[12:04:00] <ccmonster> does twitter bootstrap use the jquery ui ?
[12:04:05] <BillCriswell> Dammit.
[12:04:28] <JosephSilber> Synthead: $('#el').on('click', function (){ otherFunction('someString') });
[12:04:42] <BillCriswell> ccmonster: Missed that detail.
[12:04:55] <Synthead> JosephSilber: I have to create a function that calls another function?
[12:05:06] <c4ptnh00k> whatsgoingon?
[12:05:26] <JosephSilber> Synthead: unless you can use the native bind
[12:05:36] <Synthead> JosephSilber: how?
[12:05:59] <JosephSilber> Synthead: $('#el').on('click', otherFunction.bind($, 'someString'));
[12:06:18] <JosephSilber> But bind is only supported from IE9 and above (though you could polyfill it).
[12:07:05] <JosephSilber> Synthead: here's a polyfill: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind#Compatibility
[12:09:30] <shoky> there's $.proxy
[12:09:32] <lasha> anybody here code their own image panner?
[12:10:37] <JosephSilber> shoky: AKAIK, proxy doesn't allow you to set arguments; it only binds the context.
[12:10:56] <shoky> jQuery.proxy( function, context [, additionalArguments ] )
[12:12:53] <JosephSilber> shoky: the documentation doesn't mention it, but now that you say so I checked the source, and you're absolutely right.
[12:13:06] <shoky> i just copied that from the docs
[12:13:22] <JosephSilber> Synthead: $('#el').on('click', $.proxy(otherFunction, $, 'someString'));
[12:13:28] <BillCriswell> ccmonster: You'd have to basically check $('.tab-pane.active').has(':selected').length when the tab switches... but I don't see anyway easy way to stop the tab from being selected.
[12:13:47] <ccmonster> I think I know what ot do
[12:14:21] <BillCriswell> bootstraps tabs jus aren't built with that kind of functionality in mind.. but it's should be doable with some cleverness.
[12:14:57] <JosephSilber> shoky: you're right. That's weird. I always use jqapi.com for jQuery docs, but now it seems they're a little outdated: http://www.jqapi.com/#p=jQuery.proxy
[12:17:01] <BillCriswell> It's amazing how sublime guesses what the hell i want for tab completion lol
[12:18:35] <lasha> BillCriswell: it's bases it off of what you commonly use
[12:19:01] <BillCriswell> lasha: It's really accurate with it though.
[12:19:59] <BillCriswell> ppronu [TAB]  finds $prostores_products_numbers very easily, I understand how it does it, just like how well it's executed I guess.
[12:20:49] <BillCriswell> like used to tab completion working only from the start of the string, this does a lot more than that.
[12:39:14] <wilkinsmc> I have a complex animation of an arrow rotating and moving position
[12:39:21] <wilkinsmc> i don't know if i can even get it to work in ie8
[12:43:05] <SpinachHead> I am using animate to move marginTop  -= 70px on an image and it slides up fine.  But, then when I animate again with marginTop -=70px the image slides downwards instead of up.  The strange thing, is that If I use a div instead of an image, the second animation slides up, not down like the image does.  Any ideas?
[12:43:49] <SpinachHead> firebug even shows the margin-top changing to -140px on the second animation but the image still slides down instead of up
[12:45:06] <pachet> can you replicate this in a fiddle?
[12:48:38] <lasha> if something is already fadedout
[12:48:41] <lasha> and you apply .fadeOut()
[12:48:49] <lasha> will actually do anything in the background?
[12:49:17] <lasha> wondering this because i have a .fadeOut happening on mousemove, and want to know if it's an actual performance hit….
[12:59:37] <funhouse> In case anyone is wondering the best library for animations I have found is greensock.
[13:01:08] <shoky> in case anyone is wondering, i'm in my boxers
[13:07:38] <c4ptnh00k> do not fret shoky. noone was wondering
[13:08:17] <s5fs> shoky: that wouldn't so interesting if you weren't typing from a public library terminal
[13:10:10] <c4ptnh00k> well adam you should not be spying on people
[13:10:12] <shoky> well the channel is logged, just in case someone will take an interest in the future
[13:14:13] <c4ptnh00k> sooo bored. come on 5 oclock
[13:32:21] <s5fs> shoky: haha! I envision a future where someone mines irc logs to determine historical online clothing trends
[13:35:53] <cambazz> hello, can i safely change all $(someselector).attr('someattr') to $(someselector).val('someattr') even if the someselector is not a form element, and someattr can be anything, like rel or sid
[13:38:53] <afrance> I don't think attributes and values are the same thing so I don't think you can.
[13:39:39] <shoky> cambazz: no way
[13:40:15] <shoky> unless i'm misunderstanding "safely"
[13:40:49] <cambazz> shoky: it was something like, if i do will it work in IE7 8, etc.
[13:40:59] <shoky> .attr and .val are totally different
[13:41:00] <cambazz> val is for doing it with form values right?
[13:41:04] <cambazz> ok
[13:41:05] <shoky> so no you can't do that, not in any IE
[13:41:08] <shoky> or any browser
[13:41:10] <cambazz> where can i read about that
[13:41:15] <shoky> ?attr
[13:41:15] <b-ot> shoky: used for setting attributes on the HTML tag
[13:41:19] <shoky> `api attr
[13:41:20] <b-ot> shoky: .attr(): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[13:41:22] <shoky> `api val
[13:41:25] <b-ot> shoky: .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[13:41:54] <cambazz> ok, i am migrating a huge site from jq1.7 to 1.9.1, actually i am almost done, it was hard work
[13:43:18] <c4ptnh00k> this is why modularity is so important
[13:43:32] <shoky> word
[13:45:02] <andres_> ..
[13:46:06] <c4ptnh00k> Well now I have a question. Could anyone clarify closure.. or point me in the direction of some GOOD documentation?
[13:47:51] <freannrak> c4ptnh00k: https://developers.google.com/closure/
[13:47:58] <Sh4d0> check it out
[13:48:08] <Sh4d0> http://www.webteam.co/oranje

[13:48:57] <Sh4d0> fyi - all that's in the body is one div! ;)
[13:49:35] <c4ptnh00k> Sh4do was meaning js closure but thanks for trying to help
[13:50:05] <wilkinsmc> most people use ie 8
[13:50:08] <wilkinsmc> unfortunately :(
[13:50:41] <dabear> ?mdc closure

[13:52:17] <c4ptnh00k> google chrome does actually rule the web browsers right now. just barely but they do
[13:52:23] <quietschie> hi, sry, i just can't think at the moment...how do i add content between a given <tr> </tr> pair?
[13:53:10] <Sh4d0> and win8 w/ ie10 will hopefully put the rest of the ie family 6 feet under...
[13:53:56] <c4ptnh00k> quietschie: if it has a selector $("selector").html( stuff to append );
[13:54:11] <quietschie> thanks
[13:54:28] <quietschie> it's gettin' late :)
[13:54:44] <c4ptnh00k> yurp

[13:57:52] <Aristata> I have a text field I am setting the value to $('#text_field').val('value') but it is not changing the text on the field, even though $('#text_field').val() == 'value' Has anyone experienced this before?
[14:01:09] <quietschie> c4ptnh00k:sry to bother u again...but html seems to override what stood there. is there also some function that puts it to the end of everything inside?
[14:02:50] <quietschie> Aristata: have u tried to console.log($('#text_field'));
[14:03:24] <Aristata> Yeah
[14:03:40] <Aristata> All that does is show me the text field I already know is there
[14:04:23] <quietschie> browser cache?
[14:04:49] <c4ptnh00k> quietschie: .append() http://api.jquery.com/append/
[14:05:57] <quietschie> thanx again...i think i should quit now
[14:06:50] <c4ptnh00k> lol no problem
[14:12:48] <dylan9or> hey guys, anybody on?
[14:12:55] <c4ptnh00k> yup
[14:13:10] <dylan9or> cool, just wanted to know how to do this in jQuery... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15425087/jquery-get-text-between-two-br-elements
[14:16:11] <c4ptnh00k> lol read it
[14:19:34] <dylan9or> c4ptnh00k: i did.. doesn't explain jQuery. prev() doesn't behave the same as previoussibling
[14:20:03] <shoky> dylan9or: $('#code_block').contents()  will get you all nodes in the <pre> including text nodes
[14:21:31] <dylan9or> shoky: thanks, doesn't seem to work here. http://jsbin.com/uxiyum/2/edit
[14:22:05] <dylan9or> shoky: it should say "This is line 4
[14:22:08] <dylan9or> "

[14:38:33] <pfFredd> I'm making a simple web app that needs to remember the users, would making anonymous userid's with a related uuid in the database and storing this uuid in local storage on the device be a good strategy to do this? As it's so simple and to keep it straight forward I want to avoid all the user login-stuff
[14:39:40] <vsync_> gaping_security_hole()
[14:40:48] <Conti> JQM formatting question. HTML5 number input field type, I want to make it X characters wide - JQM makes it full width no matter what. Solutions?
[14:41:57] <Gazpacho> pffred: are you making this web site for production use?
[14:54:50] <nashant> Hey guys. Can anyone tell me why the transition animation isn't working with this  http://jsfiddle.net/ub3UD/3/
[15:00:02] <c4ptnh00k> nashant: whats not working? looks good to me
[15:01:43] <shoky> nashant: check the console
[15:02:36] <nashant> it dopesn't seem to animate. Just pops up and down in size instantly
[15:03:14] <shoky> nashant: getting a 404 on jquery.isotope.min.js
[15:03:40] <nashant> yeah, it's gone down for a min
[15:03:45] <nashant> It seems to keep doing that tonight
[15:04:03] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/ub3UD/82/
[15:05:04] <nashant> They're identical, no?
[15:05:41] <c4ptnh00k> everything is animating on my screen
[15:05:43] <shoky> one gets a 404, other doesn't
[15:05:46] <shoky> for me at least.
[15:06:01] <shoky> i changed the url for isotope js
[15:06:12] <shoky> and.. it's animating
[15:06:47] <nashant> you get a 0.8s transition?
[15:06:51] <c4ptnh00k> yes
[15:07:04] <nashant> Why the hell don't I?
[15:07:16] <nashant> Using Chrome?
[15:07:36] <c4ptnh00k> wait the resize or the movement
[15:07:39] <c4ptnh00k> ?
[15:07:40] <shoky> yah
[15:07:42] <nashant> the resize
[15:07:46] <nashant> the movement is fine
[15:07:56] <nashant> the resize doesn't animate
[15:08:10] <shoky> might've mentioned which animation you're talking about
[15:08:20] <nashant> sorry
[15:08:36] <nashant> would have been a good idea
[15:08:42] <shoky> it animates the resize 1st time
[15:09:28] <nashant> doesn't even do it first time for me
[15:14:09] <delinquentme> so it seems that I'm not sending out a field from within a form ... The issue might be that I'm dynamically adding the field ... is there a way to update which field should be sent on an ajax post?
[15:15:05] <c4ptnh00k> thats it
[15:15:15] <c4ptnh00k> its when its dynamically added
[15:16:19] <pfFredd> Gazpacho, yeah it will be public.. any other suggestions as to how to avoid having to integrate a login?
[15:16:29] <cambazz> hello, i had an error reporting function attached to ajax methods such as: error: function(XMLHttpRequest, textStatus, errorThrown) {nerror('adhatirlat.remindForm', this.context.data, this.type, this.url, XMLHttpRequest, textStatus, errorThrown);}}); it used to work before upgrade
[15:16:39] <cambazz> now seems that this.context.data is not defined
[15:16:53] <cambazz> or rather this.context is not
[15:17:54] <Gazpacho> there must be a way to avoid having users log in. All the other sites probably require log-in just because they don't know better. yes, that must be it.
[15:18:09] <shoky> nashant:  actually, what are you expecting to see resize smoothly?
[15:18:42] <nashant> shoky: I'm expecting the height and width to smoothly transition
[15:18:48] <shoky> nashant: why?
[15:18:59] <nashant> I had it at one point, but then I lost it and can't get it back
[15:19:12] <shoky> nashant: i see there's only a height transition on the container
[15:19:15] <cambazz> i would like to access the data of an ajaxcall, from an error method.
[15:19:17] <shoky> not on the items themselves
[15:19:40] <shoky> and i do see this transition happening on the container, when you enlarge the first item
[15:21:07] <nashant> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/ub3UD/83/
[15:21:14] <nashant> That's on the items as well, no?
[15:22:58] <shoky> nashant: no, but even if it were the right selector, it wouldn't animate it. you're not changing the width/height
[15:23:03] <shoky> you're hiding one element and showing another
[15:25:30] <nashant> shoky: just a mo. editing it to be closer to what I've got
[15:29:34] <nashant> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/ub3UD/84/
[15:29:58] <nashant> it seems to be animating the height when adding selected, but that's it
[15:31:08] <shoky> nashant:  only the container's height is animated:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/ub3UD/85/
[15:31:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> does any one have tips for hwo to make faster ajax responses
[15:32:21] <nashant> oh
[15:32:36] <nashant> shoky: any idea how I would go about making the items transition properly?
[15:32:37] <shoky> nashant:  here's what happens if you actually animate the items themselves: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/ub3UD/86/
[15:32:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause it takes a few seconds for a value to be returned im basically using html form -> jquery -> php -> jquery (callback)
[15:32:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> nice to see you shoky
[15:33:07] <shoky> nashant: seems to fuck up the container's animation ;p
[15:33:22] <nashant> yeah
[15:33:27] <nashant> That's what was happening before!
[15:33:34] <Whirl3d> oooh! Shoky cussed!
[15:33:45] <nashant> It MUST be possible to do both!
[15:34:15] <izzaboo> hello
[15:34:15] <shoky> hi Rohan_Bhangui
[15:34:24] <izzaboo> anybody have time for a newbie question?
[15:34:28] <shoky> and whirly
[15:34:35] <izzaboo> about reflowing tables?
[15:36:33] <izzaboo> hokay. well maybe i'll come back
[15:36:47] <Whirl3d> Izzaboo, since you are new, let me give you a hint
[15:37:04] <Whirl3d> if you wanna ask a question, don't waste it on asking if you can ask. Just ask the question
[15:37:43] <Whirl3d> We'll probably be more inclined to help. And it's not you, it's just you can only answer that same question so many times in one day before going batty..Ask shoky. He's always batty.
[15:38:10] <shoky> i'm batman
[15:38:46] <shoky> or so i like to whisper in dark alleys
[15:38:55] <Whirl3d> that was you?
[15:38:58] * Whirl3d blushes
[15:39:10] <shoky> schwingggg
[15:41:44] <boytoy> lulz what
[15:46:19] <cambazz> hello, i have a question about dragable/droppable in jq ui. i have a <ul><li> .. structure where i want to drag and drop li's. but what I want is when user drags and drops witin that ul, the li's to exchange positions
[15:47:06] <Whirl3d> cambazz, rather than having them reorder by inserting the draggable?
[15:48:08] <Whirl3d> cambazz, sounds like maybe you could capture the drag event and turn all of the items not being dragged into droppables so that when you drop it on another element, the event is fired and you swap them out.
[15:51:04] <cambazz> Whirl3d: i think i figured it out, but i used to use sortable with revert: true, placeholder: 'ui-state-highlight'
[15:51:12] <cambazz> now seems we got no placeholder functionality
[15:52:37] <boytoy> Hey, how to make jQuery Mobile's panel widget launch when you hover its trigger? Just like the new Google+? http://jsfiddle.net/WCP4F/
[15:52:59] <Whirl3d> is there such a thing as hover in mobile?
[15:53:13] <Whirl3d> How would you do that, place your finger really close, but don't touch it.
[15:54:34] <boytoy> Whirl3d: hehe
[15:55:14] <boytoy> Whirl3d: just a little treat for my desktop users i guess
[15:57:13] * boytoy starts slamming his fiddle around
[15:57:19] <Whirl3d> cambazz, what if you didn't actually change the position of the li elements, only of their content. So when you dropped, it would revert to it's original position and then swap just it's contents?
[15:57:48] <Whirl3d> boytoy, did you try using the hover method on trigger element?
[16:00:22] <boytoy> Whirl3d: hmmm
[16:00:39] <boytoy> for the first time in my life i think i actually did it on the first fiddle!
[16:00:46] <boytoy> http://jsfiddle.net/WCP4F/1/ what do you think man
[16:00:47] <boytoy> ?
[16:02:26] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/WCP4F/2/
[16:03:12] <boytoy> close.. should exit when going "out" from the panel itself, not just the trigger
[16:03:21] <boytoy> Whirl3d: wow.. quite neat
[16:03:52] <Whirl3d> so don't bind hover, just bind mouseover
[16:07:30] <boytoy_> Whirl3d: could your fiddle cover the use of hoverintent and something like http://jsfiddle.net/WCP4F/3/ ?
[16:07:44] <systemfault> The problem with mouseover is that the handler is going to be called a lot of times AFAIK
[16:08:05] <systemfault> You might want to consider mouseenter instead (That's what .hover uses)
[16:08:09] <boytoy_> working as it should now although the code is very ugly
[16:08:45] <boytoy_> systemfault: currently using hoverintent to account for slight possible user delays, am very fond of using it for dropdown menus
[16:09:01] <systemfault> :)
[16:09:52] <boytoy_> * slight possible user off-hovers
[16:13:39] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/WCP4F/5/
[16:13:54] <Whirl3d> strange that. It says moused out even though it clearly is not.
[16:16:03] <Assim_Build> is there a way to use a dynamically generated dom object for a draggable helper instead of a clone? http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/DMedb/2/
[16:19:15] <Assim_Build> (I haven't coded the logical boxes, just the "Name" general filter (only left one for simplicity)) if you change the draggable helper to "clone" it will show a helper with the text "Name" but I'm wondering if I could show an image of the div that will be generated
[16:24:53] <cambazz> hey so i am doing drags and drops. when i drag and drop something i can get what i am dragging, but i have to find where i am dropping to
[16:25:38] <boytoy> Whirl3d: perhaps just stick to http://jsfiddle.net/WCP4F/3/ ?
[16:26:03] <Assim_Build> cambazz: have you looked at this example? http://jqueryui.com/droppable/
[16:28:02] <Whirl3d> boytoy, click on the button when the panel is open
[16:30:26] <boytoy> Whirl3d: thats impossible
[16:32:18] <hawtin> http://jsfiddle.net/melbourne/ctagH/6/ I need to have an active state for every navigation btn like on hover state , is that possible and if it is can someone please just implement one example just so I can see how the thing works with removeClass cause I have no idea.. just add all clases to addClass and removeClass? thats it?
[16:34:37] <hawtin> I know its dumb but I am new/bie in js
[16:37:39] <poseidon> How can i add a div to the dom.  ie I have a form which a person can add a post and it show up under previous posts.
[16:38:14] <shoky> hawtin: isn't that what you're doing?  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/ctagH/7/
[16:38:55] <delinquentme> on a jquery AJAX post ... what determines whether a error function or success function is used?
[16:39:00] <delinquentme> is it the 200 code?
[16:39:06] <hawtin> shoky I meant when selected
[16:39:22] <shoky> meaning?
[16:39:38] <hawtin> with active no matter what page you're on the left border will be red all time
[16:40:04] <hawtin> so I want to have a distinct color like the hover state :| hope Im clear this time
[16:40:12] <shoky> not really
[16:40:26] <shoky> you want it to persist between page loads?
[16:42:23] <hawtin> well you see the left red border on first button.. that will happen if you are on any other page(=any other button), but I want to have different colors not just that red that applies to all of the buttons
[16:43:50] <shoky> shrugs
[16:45:45] <shoky> btw, id's should be unique
[16:45:54] <hawtin> you have 2 buttons home and news. when you are at home page the left red border will appear, if you move to news the left red border will appear ( I just want to have different colors for every page ) , and I've asked if it is that simple just add more classes to .addClass and then add them to .removeClass too ?
[16:45:59] <hawtin> yes
[16:46:10] <hawtin> cause for the moment I have a class for all of them that red left border
[16:46:32] <shoky> donno man, if you want another color, put another color
[16:47:01] <hawtin> no, again, i want multiple colors multiple classes
[16:47:10] <hawtin> :D
[16:47:11] <shoky> then do that
[16:47:19] <rbs> Is there a way to call $('myForm').submit(); (to using the action/method defined on form tag) and get the result data into a variable to send to a div?
[16:47:38] <hawtin> well, I've asked how? add classes to .addClass and .removeClass
[16:47:39] <hawtin> ?
[16:47:48] <hawtin> that simple?
[16:48:02] <shoky> addClass will add classes
[16:48:06] <shoky> it's that simple.
[16:48:29] <hawtin> ok will come back with results:)
[16:48:31] <Assim_Build> is there a way I could make the helper for a draggable a dynamically generated dom object? or is there a better approach to this? http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/DMedb/3/ (try dragging 'Name' onto the dotted box)
[16:49:52] <shoky> Assim_Build: http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-helper
[16:50:14] <shoky> Multiple types supported:  Function: A function that will return a DOMElement to use while dragging.
[16:50:47] <Assim_Build> oh the function...call it a skitoma, I had that very page already open but was blind to my answer :S
[16:51:13] <Assim_Build> shoky: thanks
[16:55:24] <hawtin> shoky I've tried but failed miserably..
[16:56:12] <hawtin> I mean no change, the active class still overrides all classes I've added
[16:56:43] <cambazz> how do i hide everything inside a div?
[16:57:02] <f00f> hide the div
[16:57:22] <cambazz> well i dont want to hide the div, i want to hide the children of a div
[16:57:30] <cambazz> rather children of an li
[16:57:40] <f00f> you can use .children() and .hide() for example
[16:58:14] <f00f> look at the tree traversal docs
[16:59:57] <shoky> hawtin: then fix your css.. maybe you want this, i donno:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/ctagH/8/
[17:01:41] <hawtin> you clearly didnt understood what I needed cause you just changed the color of the border :)
[17:02:06] <shoky> clearly
[17:02:57] <shoky> i didnt change any color, i just made the active ones use the same css as the :hover ones, now it's not just red. that's the most i managed to understand from you
[17:03:22] <shoky> you said: I just want to have different colors for every page
[17:04:25] <shoky> and: any other page(=any other button)
[17:04:52] <hawtin> yes but I want them to show when they are selected
[17:05:20] <hawtin> not when they're not :) like if you're on page x to show color x on that button - the rest leave the be;
[17:05:28] <shoky> there are no pages there
[17:05:31] <shoky> only one page
[17:05:34] <shoky> let's start with that.
[17:06:24] <hawtin> can I give you a prv message to enter my site with a user and password to see what Im talking about..
[17:06:50] <shoky> ok
[17:15:58] <Antaranian> hi ladies
[17:20:07] <mixel> hi baby
[17:39:04] <wilkinsmc> is there any way in jquery to target -ms-filter for css?
[17:40:25] <JosephSilber> Just use the regular .css() function, and pass it `-ms-filter`
[17:40:55] <JosephSilber> If you're using a newer version a jQuery, you don't even have to worry about vendor prefixes, just use .css('filter')
[17:41:13] <wilkinsmc> 1.7.1
[17:41:22] <wilkinsmc> i tried but doesn't seem to be working
[17:41:33] <wilkinsmc> $me.css('-ms-filter', "'progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Matrix(M11=0.98480775, M12=-0.17364818, M21=0.17364818, M22=0.98480775,sizingMethod='auto expand')'")
[17:42:05] * hawtin @ gone
[17:50:47] <lenswipe> hey guys
[17:50:55] <lenswipe> could someone help me fix my execution path?
[17:50:56] <lenswipe> http://pastebin.com/6BgTM8jL
[17:51:16] <lenswipe> I'm trying to check a password async and alter the form data depending on the result
[17:51:28] <lenswipe> but because it's async im having problems with setting a variable from the jquery callback
[17:51:28] <lenswipe> :/
[17:52:19] <shoky> do things in the callback.
[17:52:37] <shoky> dont put any code after the $.ajax() call
[17:52:59] <shoky> because that's just making the illusion (for you) that it will run after the async ajax is finished
[17:53:01] <lenswipe> nevermind - I fix it
[17:53:07] <lenswipe> i fixed it*
[17:53:19] <lenswipe> i passed async: false into the $.ajax object
[17:53:31] <shoky> :'-(
[17:53:53] <lenswipe> shoky, it can't go in the callback because I want the form to submit anyway if the person doesn't type anything in the password fields
[17:53:55] <shoky> that's the bad lazy way to do it
[17:54:03] <shoky> you can go in the callback.
[17:54:04] <lenswipe> it's the only way to do it in this situation
[17:54:06] <lenswipe> i can't l
[17:54:08] <shoky> no, it's not.
[17:54:10] <lenswipe> let me explain why
[17:54:14] <lenswipe> please let me explain
[17:54:22] <shoky> you can always submit the form manually later
[17:54:27] <lenswipe> list
[17:54:28] <shoky> form[0].submit()
[17:54:28] <lenswipe> listen*
[17:54:40] <lenswipe> it's a user account settings page
[17:54:46] <lenswipe> the person submits the form
[17:55:24] <shoky> so you want the page to freeze up if the connection is a bit whack ?
[17:55:28] <lenswipe> if they type something in the old password field then it assumes they want to change their password, it then checks to make sure that that password is correct, if it is then it checks the new password against confirm new password, if THEY match then it adds that to the post data
[17:55:52] <lenswipe> if they don't type anything in the password box then I want to just submit the form without the password fields
[17:55:58] <shoky> whatever.
[17:56:31] <lenswipe> the problem with putting it in the success callback is that the effect would mean that the person would have to confirm their old password just to update their name
[17:57:29] <lenswipe> i was going to use success:function(){} if their password was right and error: function(){} if it wasn't but I wanted to submit the form anyway so I considered using complete: function(){}
[17:57:37] <shoky> i haven't followed your logic but nothing about it calls for async: false
[17:58:16] <lenswipe> shoky, the problem with using the complete callback is that I need to pass the password field into it from the success callback which to the best of my knowledge isn't possible
[17:58:26] <lenswipe> so that's why I went with async: false
[17:58:56] <shoky> as long as you're happy
[17:59:03] <shoky> i'm ok with it
[17:59:34] <lenswipe> okay
[17:59:43] <shoky> hope your users will be :P
[17:59:43] <lenswipe> out of interest - what would you recommend instead?
[17:59:58] <lenswipe> shoky, user(singular) - it's an admin panel for me and my GF
[18:00:03] <lenswipe> but yeah, what would you do instead
[18:00:31] <shoky> doing things in callbacks, and maybe using promises to make the callbacks a bit nicer to work with
[18:00:40] <lenswipe> promises?
[18:00:55] <shoky> but since i didnt follow your logic at all, i dont really have concrete advice for you
[18:01:23] <shoky> `g jquery deferreds eric hynds
[18:01:24] <b-ot> shoky: Using Deferreds in jQuery 1.5 - Eric Hynds → http://www.erichynds.com/blog/using-deferreds-in-jquery
[18:01:36] <lenswipe> shoky, what is a promise?
[18:01:40] <shoky> $.ajax() returns a promise
[18:02:01] <shoky> promise is smth you can call .done()  and .fail() and .always() on
[18:02:21] <lenswipe> ok
[18:02:30] <shoky> similar to the 'success', 'error', and 'complete'  that are specific to ajax requests
[18:02:33] <JosephSilber> shoky: Technically, $.ajax returns a jqXHR object, which implements the promise API.
[18:02:33] <lenswipe> ah
[18:02:36] <lenswipe> ill look at that
[18:02:37] <lenswipe> brb
[18:02:40] <shoky> but internally they just use promises
[18:02:57] <shoky> JosephSilber: i know.. a jqXHR is a promise, amongst other things
[18:03:08] <shoky> i didnt want to discuss the other thigns now
[18:04:30] <Zxurian> can something akin to this be done without separate animate calls?$('.colorBar').animate({      left: $(this).attr('data-left')+'%', }, 1000); (
[18:04:51] <Zxurian> (provide each element with .colorBar will have a different .attr('data-left') value)
[18:08:44] <JosephSilber> Zxurian: $('.colorBar').each(function (){ $(this).animate({      left: $(this).attr('data-left')+'%', }, 1000); });
[18:09:10] <shoky> $(this).data('left')  plz
[18:09:11] <Zxurian> thanks. was leaning towards that, just wasn't sure if there was a way to do it without the .each()
[18:09:35] <shoky> with .css() it could be done. not with .animate()
[18:11:04] <JosephSilber> shoky: how could you possibly do that without .each?
[18:11:45] <JosephSilber> Zxurian: can't you just rely on CSS transitions? then you'll just add a class and be done with it.
[18:11:59] <JosephSilber> Zxurian: unless obviously you have to support oldIE
[18:12:14] <shoky> JosephSilber: with .css?   $('.colorBar').css('left', function() { return $(this).data('left') })
[18:12:21] <Zxurian> hm... that might be a better solution
[18:12:26] <shoky> sorry, forgot the +'%'
[18:18:39] <JosephSilber> shoky: right. Forgot about the implicit loop there....
[18:19:08] <shoky> best loops are the ones you dont have to write :D
[18:19:13] <Zxurian> +1
[18:19:56] <cambazz> hello, so i am almost done with draggable, and achieved what i need. the thing is in some cases when i drag an item, item is offsetted, below pointer like 200px
[18:19:59] <cambazz> i wonder why
[18:20:37] <MickRip> cambazz: should be a css thing
[18:20:44] <MickRip> cambazz: *could (not should)
[18:21:14] <shoky> cambazz: could be padding getting in the way, maybe some other css thing like MickRip says. a demo would help
[18:22:29] <MickRip> cambazz: also, could be a big diff. between some cases and all cases :P
[18:25:09] <Zxurian> the css for .colorBox should just be "transition: left 1s ease;" right? I didn't think I needed vendor prefixes the transition property
[18:27:36] <Joseph_Silber> Zxurian: you do need vendor prefixes, just not for IE.
[18:28:06] <Zxurian> hm.. weird, using firefox, and with firebug, -moz-transition auto-replaces with transition
[18:29:04] <Joseph_Silber> Zxurian: webkit anf gecko have both removed their vendor prefix from transition, but only veru recently. You still need it for the majority of browsers in the wild.
[18:31:37] <Zxurian> roger, thanks for the heads up
[18:31:50] <lenswipe> do you guys know if it's valid to pass an object into $.ajax as form data?
[18:32:51] <shoky> lenswipe: let's check the docs  ( http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ )
[18:33:04] <shoky> lenswipe: data  Type: PlainObject or String
[18:33:16] <shoky> lenswipe: Data to be sent to the server. It is converted to a query string, if not already a string.
[18:33:25] <shoky> lenswipe: Object must be Key/Value pairs
[18:34:08] <Joseph_Silber> Why does jQuery include a JSON parser, but not an encoder?
[18:37:53] <shoky> Joseph_Silber: one reason could be, that it's because jquery NEEDS a json parser, but not an encoder
[18:37:58] <shoky> internally, that is.
[18:38:28] <shoky> and if it already has it, why not make it public
[18:38:49] <shoky> just a guess.
[18:41:10] <Gazpacho> the creator of jquery was firmly against pulling things into it that other people suggested because it would be "nice"
[18:41:38] <Gazpacho> remember people have to download the thing
[18:41:50] <jimi_> shoky, what is the difference between the jquery json parser and javascript's JSON.parse?
[18:41:52] <shoky> also in jquery 2.0.0 $.parseJSON points straight to JSON.parse
[18:41:57] <jimi_> oh
[18:43:05] <shoky> jimi_ before 2.0 it would use JSON.parse if available, otherwise it'd make sure it's JSON with regex and then it'd parse it by eval()ing it as javascript
[18:43:18] <shoky> (not actually eval(), but same)
[19:06:30] <kedarm> To ensure that an element is always visible, I am implementing a strategy: $(this).show(); $(this).parents("div").show(); I believe it works as expected. What is a better way?
[19:06:56] <Joseph_Silber> shoky: Why is that needed? Even IE8 supports JSON natively
[19:11:26] <shoky> Joseph_Silber: IE7 doesn't
[19:11:57] <Joseph_Silber> shoky: I was asking about 2.0, which has dropped support for IE < 9
[19:12:32] <shoky> Joseph_Silber: it's not needed there. but 2.0 is advertised as having the same API as 1.9
[20:10:10] <boytoy> Trying to launch a jQuery Mobile panel on hover (for desktop) like the new Google+ using hoverIntent: http://jsfiddle.net/WCP4F/9/
[20:10:13] <boytoy> But is there a way to move the scroll bar from the main window to the panel itself (like Google+)? Because if it's in the main window, the panel will collapse once off-hovered.
[20:21:07] <mk> :)
[20:21:52] <mk> $("#item").on("load", function(e){ var f = "red"; }); alert(f);
[20:22:02] <mk> What am I doing wrong?
[20:24:01] <tw2113> variable is out of scope
[20:24:17] <mk> So what do you recommend to fix this?
[20:24:20] <Joseph_Silber> You're alerting f before it's available. Move the alert statement inside of the event listener
[20:24:32] <min|dvir|us> Is it possible to resolve/reject a $.Deferred with another promise?
[20:24:33] <fatmandown_> hello everyone. i'm trying to pass an html-to-php array (checkbox named posts[]) to my jquery $.ajax call and i can't figure out what to use as the data: portion
[20:24:34] <Joseph_Silber> mk: $("#item").on("load", function(e){ var f = "red"; alert(f); });
[20:24:43] <mk> Then
[20:25:18] <mk> function hello() { $("#item").on("load", function(e){ var f = "red"; return f; }); }
[20:25:27] <mk> var f = hello();
[20:25:44] <Joseph_Silber> fatmandown_: Just use an array. jQuery will serialize it for you: data: {posts: ['a', 'b', 'c']}
[20:26:14] <Joseph_Silber> mk: You can't return anything from there. That's just not how events work. They run asynchronously.
[20:26:41] <fatmandown_> Joseph_Silber: should I call it posts or posts[]:
[20:26:42] <fatmandown_> ?
[20:26:45] <mk> So how do I create such a function that returns a  value from a .on()
[20:26:59] <min|dvir|us> mk: that's not how it works.
[20:27:02] <Joseph_Silber> fatmandown_: Just posts. jQuery will do the rest.
[20:27:09] <mk> ...
[20:27:16] <mk> So I just repeat my code?
[20:27:27] <min|dvir|us> mk: how did you get that from what I said?
[20:27:42] <mk> Let me post my full code.
[20:27:57] <Joseph_Silber> min|dvir|us: Can you be more specific? What do you mean by resoving one with the other?
[20:28:05] <Joseph_Silber> resolving*
[20:28:20] <tw2113> make a jsfiddle out of it mk
[20:28:28] <fatmandown_> I assigned the checked boxes to an array, and gave it posts:array; as data, but it still breaks everything...hm.
[20:28:38] <min|dvir|us> Joseph_Silber: I want the promise to depend on the next promise.
[20:29:03] <Joseph_Silber> min|dvir|us: That's what then is for. Whatever you return from then will be used firther down in the chain...
[20:29:05] <mk> http://bambulabs.org/sky/
[20:29:45] <min|dvir|us> Joseph_Silber: could you explain?
[20:30:09] <Joseph_Silber> min|dvir|us: If you'll explain your use case it'll be easier to explain.
[20:30:28] <min|dvir|us> bambu: see that $(document).ready(function(){}) block?
[20:30:32] <min|dvir|us> All your code should be in there.
[20:31:16] <bambu> Sure, I got to clean up a bit :p
[20:31:31] <min|dvir|us> Joseph_Silber: I made a Deferred which I am rejecting conditionally.
[20:31:56] <min|dvir|us> If I don't reject it, though, I want it to exactly reflect another deferred.
[20:32:22] <min|dvir|us> I'm comparing passwords; if the passwords don't match, I reject; otherwise, I do asynchronous stuff that returns a promise.
[20:32:29] <min|dvir|us> I want that promise to be reflected in the original.
[20:33:50] <Seldon75> I know this is a noob question, but in order to use .tooltip() do I need something other than jquery and jquery-ui js and css linked on the page?
[20:34:57] <Seldon75> in my header is http://pastebin.com/TimTbtqD
[20:35:14] <bambu> min|dvir|us,
[20:35:48] <Seldon75> and when i do jQuery( "#count_1" ).tooltip({ content: "Awesome" }) it fails silently
[20:36:50] <min|dvir|us> Seldon75: "silently"
[20:37:01] <min|dvir|us> Are you sure your JS console is open, which is the first step of any web dev?
[20:37:04] <Seldon75> it doesnt give an error, but there's no tooltip on the element
[20:37:07] <Seldon75> yes
[20:37:10] <Seldon75> in Chrome
[20:37:17] <Seldon75> i'm issuing that command in the console
[20:37:38] <min|dvir|us> Seldon75: is the DOM modified?
[20:38:14] <Seldon75> no, but the method call does return the element count_1
[20:40:00] <Joseph_Silber> min|dvir|us: var dfd = $.Deferred();
[20:40:00] <Joseph_Silber> if ( ! validPassword() ) {
[20:40:00] <Joseph_Silber>     dfd.reject('Wrong password.');
[20:40:00] <Joseph_Silber> }
[20:40:00] <Joseph_Silber> else {
[20:40:01] <Joseph_Silber>     var jqXHR = $.post() // ...
[20:40:03] <Joseph_Silber>     
[20:40:05] <Joseph_Silber>     jqXHR.done(dfd.resolve).fail(dfd.reject);
[20:40:07] <Joseph_Silber> }
[20:40:18] <min|dvir|us> Joseph_Silber: nice, thanks.
[20:40:40] <Seldon75> so there should be no other files I need to link?
[20:42:07] <bambu> So I'm not sure of i understand this...
[20:42:51] <bambu> .on's return function has its own scope, the fsend() function has its own scope, and document has its own
[20:43:03] <min|dvir|us> bambu: JS is function-scoped.
[20:43:40] <bambu> If I want to create a function that uses .on in it,  I need to return the data from .on's return() function to my fsend() function, right?
[20:44:24] <min|dvir|us> bambu: if you want to create a function that uses `.on` and "return" something from it, have your function accept a function, which you call when you want to return.
[20:44:35] <min|dvir|us> This is the continuation-passing style (CPS).
[20:46:08] <bambu> Look at my code, do you seethe idea?
[20:46:28] <min|dvir|us> bambu: are you listening to me?
[20:47:26] <bambu> ...
[20:48:06] <min|dvir|us> bambu: I'll try to make this as clear as I can.
[20:48:24] <min|dvir|us> You want to return sp[1].split(";")[1], right?
[20:48:39] <Tamborine> so jquery animate say's it uses the "swing" easing by default....... what other easing options does jquery have out of the box?
[20:49:03] <min|dvir|us> Tamborine: see $.easing.
[20:49:20] <TuxBlackEdo> I am trying to do a iframe that adjusts it's height based on the content inside the iframe, it works fine, however when I try to expand/collapse a div on the iframe's page it doesn't account for this... how would I go about fixing this? I was thinking I would setinterval and call the resizing iframe function again?
[20:49:29] <bambu> shhh
[20:49:54] <min|dvir|us> TuxBlackEdo: no.
[20:50:02] <min|dvir|us> TuxBlackEdo: from within the iframe, $(document).resize().
[20:50:25] <TuxBlackEdo> where would I put that...?
[20:50:26] <min|dvir|us> That's the event handler you want. Then pass a message to the outer document, which resizes the <iframe>.
[20:50:30] * TuxBlackEdo is a noob
[20:50:39] <min|dvir|us> TuxBlackEdo: in some <script> within the iframe.
[20:51:07] <min|dvir|us> Or if you have a reference to the iframe's document from the outer context, you can use $(iframeDocument).resize(evtHandler);.
[20:52:05] <TuxBlackEdo> oh ok, i'll try that
[21:01:58] <bambu> http://bambulabs.org/sky/
[21:02:02] <bambu> Works beautiful :)
[21:02:24] <bambu> TY min
[21:02:36] <min|dvir|us> bambu: you didn't learn anything.
[21:02:49] <min|dvir|us> You worked around the problem rather than through it.
[21:03:24] <bambu> min|dvir|us, I decided that tonight getting it working was more important.
[21:03:31] <min|dvir|us> bambu: fair enough.
[21:04:45] <bambu> I also realised that the other things I need to implement are GET requests, so I'm looking at using <script></script> so I'll still learn what you said about CPS
[21:05:09] <min|dvir|us> bambu: you're going to have to if you want to do most things in JS.
[21:05:12] <TuxBlackEdo> min|dvir|us, so I have found the place in the iframe where the toggle event is called (to collapse/expand additional content) i got an alert set on it when i click it.. so what should I call when this happens to let (i am using "jquery iframe auto height" from github)
[21:05:14] <min|dvir|us> (BTW most people don't use the term CPS.)
[21:05:34] <min|dvir|us> TuxBlackEdo: that's not where you want to put your code.
[21:05:46] <min|dvir|us> You want to resize the <iframe> when the contents resize, not when something triggers a content resize.
[21:06:19] <min|dvir|us> From within the iframe's document: $(document).resize(function () { passMessageToParent(newSize); });
[21:07:16] <TuxBlackEdo> may I PM you? it would mean so much to me and i would be forever grateful
[21:07:24] <min|dvir|us> No.
[21:09:33] <bambu> :p
[21:12:18] <TuxBlackEdo> hah
[21:12:26] <TuxBlackEdo> I figured it out using setinterval
[21:12:29] <TuxBlackEdo> so much better
[22:04:53] <insel> how can i call $.get in a function and return the fetched data ... http://pastebin.com/RjyEHcXV ... kind of "push" data from inner function on level up
[22:08:04] <ryorky1> are there any jquery dropdown plugins that allow a submit input to be included as one of the items
[22:08:09] <ryorky1> ?
[22:09:16] <Derimagia> insel you can't because ajax runs async, do the logic in the callback if you can and if you REALLY can't you can set async = false but that will stop all JS execution until it has returned
[22:18:42] <insel> in the "inner" function, it is "waiting" and i m getting data. i really cant believe that its not possible to let a function "wait" for a function that "waits" for a function that "waits". ...  and the same thing with less 1 "depth" (a function "wait" for a function that "waits") is possible.
[22:19:08] <min|dvir|us> insel: don't fight it.
[22:19:30] <min|dvir|us> insel: 'waiting' is a terrible, terrible curse in programming.
[22:19:43] <insel> so call it async or what ever
[22:19:52] <min|dvir|us> insel: exactly. That is completely different than waiting.
[22:20:41] <min|dvir|us> insel: sleep(10); do_stuff(); means that for 10 seconds, nothing else can happen.
[22:20:48] <insel> but giving it an other name doesnt solve the problem ;)
[22:21:06] <min|dvir|us> insel: whereas setTimeout(function () { do_stuff(); }, 10000); means stuff can happen, but in 10 seconds do_stuff is called.
[22:21:12] <min|dvir|us> insel: it's not another name, it's a completely different paradigm.
[22:22:01] <min|dvir|us> (Equivalently: `setTimeout(do_stuff, 10000);`)
[22:22:18] <insel> so is async not "waiting for data" ... bref... is there a way to call a async function in async function in a async function
[22:22:37] <kevireilly> insel: this is a pretty neat library for dealing with various asyncawesomesauces https://github.com/caolan/async/
[22:23:05] <min|dvir|us> insel: async is more like letting data come to you.
[22:23:25] <min|dvir|us> "Oh, here's data, now we can do stuff."
[22:24:02] <min|dvir|us> Sync is waiting for data. "Is there data? No, keep waiting. Oh, there's data now? We can do stuff."
[22:24:09] <kevireilly> var doStuff = function(callback){ /* do stuff and call the callback when we're done */ callback(passStuff); doStuff(function(newStuff){ /* i got reached after doStuff was done doing it's stuff */ });
[22:24:30] <kevireilly> doh.. forgot to close out the function definition with }); after callback, but yeah
[22:24:42] <min|dvir|us> insel: so you know, any synchronous I/O is pretty much broken by design.
[22:24:48] <min|dvir|us> In any language.
[22:25:01] <min|dvir|us> sys.stdin.readline() // broken
[22:26:33] <insel> kevireilly: was that an answer to my pastebin?
[22:27:46] <kevireilly> insel: just showing an example of a simple self defined async function
[22:28:13] <min|dvir|us> kevireilly: it's not really async unless there's a call to the event loop.
[22:28:14] <kevireilly> but now i see your example and your'e already doing that haha
[22:28:23] <min|dvir|us> For example:
[22:28:54] <min|dvir|us> >> (function (callback) { callback('asdf'); })(console.log);
[22:29:18] <min|dvir|us> (Not async.)
[22:30:14] <min|dvir|us> $.ajax and setTimeout are both async because they exit the stack frame.
[22:30:21] <min|dvir|us> They rely on the event loop.
[22:31:35] <insel> i feel like ordering meat and getting a lesson about "growing" pigs
[22:31:52] <insel> "but but sir i m still hungry"
[22:32:55] <vsync_> fucking glasses, got stepped on
[22:32:59] <vsync_> by me
[22:33:02] <vsync_> :(
[22:35:45] <kevireilly> crapcakes.. my hard drive reached zero kb free haha
[22:36:50] <kevireilly> insel: now that i can type again, the problem is probably that you need to pass data as an argument to afterLoad(); lie afterLoad(data); Also, you may just want to do return afterLoad(data); at the end there instead
[22:40:37] <kevireilly> min|dvir|us: ah i see what you're saying, but you might do something inside of doStuff (such as that that is actually async, perhaps several things, before returning the result to some other mystical callback
[22:42:07] <insel> kevireilly: thx.. thats it
[22:42:33] <kevireilly> insel: no problem
[23:45:29] <Zxurian> does anyone know of a jQuery plugin that will animate a group of elements and fan them out? (closest thing I can describe is the dealing of cards playing Windows Solitare)
[23:56:55] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/cMJqn/1/ how do i get pretime lenght to be synced, and not read whats come from the dom?
[23:57:06] <lenswipee> hi, this line of code was working, but appears to not work anymore. Does anyone know why? $select.val(jQuery('option:first').val());
[23:57:53] <lenswipee> $select refers to a drop down menu
[23:58:24] <lenswipee> i get blank when alerting jQuery('option:first').val()
