[00:34:15] <dimi1947> is there an equivalent of PHP's rtrim in jquery/JS...I just want to remove the last 2 characters from a string?
[00:37:28] <Uhkis> string.replace(/..$/, '');
[00:51:37] <Nyterax> jQuery(this).stop().animate({backgroundPosition: "center 39px"}); why doesn´t this work?
[00:52:29] <Nyterax> it´s centered already btw
[00:52:54] <Nyterax> i want to animate the 2nd value
[01:02:12] <dimi1947> I have some DOM elements(in the markup) that when document.ready are hidden....the problem is that the user for a fraction of a sec sees them and then they are gone from view.....is there anything I can do to prevent this effect?
[01:04:15] <Nyterax> I do the same thing and don´t see them.
[01:04:36] <Nyterax> is it the first thing you do on document.ready?
[01:04:52] <dimi1947> what is the first thing?clarify
[01:06:58] <dimi1947> the browser reads first the markup and then the code inside document.ready....that is the reason I see them
[01:07:10] <dimi1947> and I am trying to fund a solution to it
[01:08:49] <Uhkis> how about this magical thing called css?
[01:11:48] <Nyterax> well, if you spend fraction of a sec doing other stuff before you get to hiding the elements part, then that´s the problem
[01:57:39] <jedrek> i'm trying to use append to append a form field to a form thrice. it works the first time, but each next append attempt fails

[01:59:21] <jedrek> and now it works
[01:59:31] <jedrek> ok, i'll do that next time
[02:07:18] <manivenkat> Hi
[02:09:54] <christoph_> is it possible to update the on click listener ?
[02:10:11] <christoph_> if add on click multiple times each of this listeners would be called
[02:19:14] <christoph_> or even better can you search via $ selector in a special dif
[02:19:15] <christoph_> div
[02:20:42] <Xatenev> christoph_: what is ur problem
[02:21:46] <christoph_> i am dynamicly adding jquery ui buttons (and i want to register a on click listener) to the button icons
[02:21:55] <Xatenev> christoph_: u shouldnt ask about a possible solution but about your actual problem "https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem"
[02:21:56] <Xatenev> yea
[02:21:59] <Xatenev> are u searching for .one?
[02:22:01] <Xatenev> https://api.jquery.com/one/
[02:22:54] <christoph_> mhh that shouldnt work
[02:23:10] <Xatenev> Idk u just wrote "if add onclick multiple times each of this listener would be called"
[02:24:03] <christoph_> mhh would be cooler if i am able to seach via $ in a special div
[02:25:20] <Xatenev> $('.divClass').find() ?
[02:26:35] <christoph_> i need to check :D
[02:27:24] <christoph_> jeah that should work thanks

[04:20:06] <delboy1978uk> on a mobile i need to replace a select element with a button, and when i click that button for the select to be activated, can anyone help?
[04:20:21] <delboy1978uk> i’b
[04:20:23] <delboy1978uk> oops
[04:20:45] <delboy1978uk> ive got the button displaying on mobile only, and the select is hidden
[04:21:04] <slax0r> why not use a existing plugin?
[04:21:20] <delboy1978uk> i thought i could do this sort of thing $('#mobile-sort-button').click(function(){  $j('#sort-by').click(); });
[04:21:54] <slax0r> is the <select> element hidden?
[04:22:19] <delboy1978uk> yes
[04:22:20] <slax0r> and seriously, don't reinvent the wheel http://www.unheap.com/?s=dropdown
[04:22:31] <slax0r> well, if the select is hidden, the options are hidden
[04:22:47] <delboy1978uk> slax0r: cheers for that link!
[04:22:53] <opalepatrick> I am trying to use a json object in the data array for charts.js but get nothing - without an error. http://pastebin.com/8jCvKU3t - I have also pasted the console output. Is it because it is still an object? I suspect I need a proper numeric array?
[04:23:06] <delboy1978uk> its mainly for iphone, you know they use that scrolly wheel type thing?
[04:23:31] <slax0r> yeah, you tap the select element and their ugly overlay jumps up
[04:23:51] <slax0r> but I don't know if I would go replace that
[04:23:59] <slax0r> people are kind of used to that
[04:24:08] <decx> what's ugly about it
[04:24:34] <slax0r> the whole ios is ugly :)
[04:24:39] <slax0r> it's a personal thing ;)
[04:24:53] <decx> isn't it the saem as in android
[04:25:03] <decx> you click a select and it has a fullscreenish list
[04:25:13] <slax0r> did I say that android does it pretier?
[04:25:24] <slax0r> don't turn this into a my d is bigger than yours argument...
[04:25:28] <decx> i like the fullscreen list
[04:26:35] <decx> why do you map an array into an array opalepatrick?
[04:28:04] <opalepatrick> tbh I left that in but I was hoping that I might get a numeric array from that. I know it has done nothing. Me misunderstanding object arrays and numeric arrays
[04:28:20] <opalepatrick> decx
[04:28:38] <decx> but according to your log your response cost is already that
[04:29:18] <opalepatrick> so that is a proper numeric array, decx?
[04:29:31] <decx> sure
[04:29:42] <delboy1978uk> slax0r: im not replacing that, i just want the boring looking select to look like a button, so i made a button that when clicked, clicks the select element (which is hidden). was hoping the iOS wheel thing would appear
[04:30:06] <slax0r> ah, now I get it
[04:30:25] <decx> i dont think that'll work if you select is hidden
[04:30:34] <decx> but you could use appearance
[04:30:38] <opalepatrick> OK, decx, that is good to know. So now I have to work out why the array is not being spit out when the var is used in charts.js - different problem
[04:30:38] <decx> or what it's called
[04:30:53] <slax0r> delboy1978uk: is it to make the select element look entirely different, or just to get rid of the ios styles on it?
[04:31:24] <decx> depends opalepatrick do you wait until your feed is loaded to call the charts function`?
[04:31:31] <slax0r> because a css rule -webkit-appearance: none; will get rid of it
[04:32:07] <slax0r> and then you can apply your styles
[04:32:12] <slax0r> so you maybe wont need a button
[04:32:31] <slax0r> if you want to do it like you do now, you must not hide the <select> element
[04:32:39] <slax0r> you could use position to position it off screen
[04:32:46] <slax0r> then maybe it chould work
[04:34:02] <opalepatrick> decx, I did previously, but now I do http://pastebin.com/pVSVwerr (costs in the first data call is producing nothing)
[04:35:07] <decx> does it do something if you just add an array instead of costs?
[04:36:09] <opalepatrick> sorry decx - this is the full code, but yes it does produce if I print the array. The second call is just that and it is fine.
[04:36:12] <opalepatrick> http://pastebin.com/mLd308WX
[04:36:16] <delboy1978uk> slax0r: heres what i have http://jsbin.com/kovajuvubi/1/edit?html,js,output
[04:37:28] <decx> i mean just for testing, if you add an array by hand does it fire?
[04:37:40] <decx> drawing to the canvas
[04:39:03] <decx> it does http://jsfiddle.net/nrjwwL2w/
[04:39:16] <slax0r> delboy1978uk: https://github.com/eduardolundgren/jquery-simulate/blob/master/jquery.simulate.js
[04:39:20] <slax0r> take a look at this
[04:39:27] <slax0r> it will enable you to do .simulate("mosuedown")
[04:39:35] <slax0r> select expands on mousedown not click
[04:39:48] <slax0r> but dunno if this will work for iphone
[04:39:55] <decx> it expands on focus
[04:40:02] <decx> no it doesnt
[04:40:04] <decx> ^^
[04:41:02] <delboy1978uk> interesting
[04:41:09] <opalepatrick> decx, I feel like a complete a**e - I thought it was not spitting out anything as the output looked very similar to the second cal on its own and I never noticed that the scale had changed
[04:41:31] <decx> nelson *haha*
[04:41:33] <delboy1978uk> ive actually found a solution on my new works old website lol
[04:42:11] <delboy1978uk> they make the label into a button shape, then remove all styling from the select and get it over the top of the label
[04:42:18] <opalepatrick> So it is working - decx - goodness knows how long that has been OK
[04:42:38] <opalepatrick> thanks decx
[04:48:29] <opalepatrick> just got that cockney rhyming slang decx :-)
[04:48:54] <slax0r> delboy1978uk: that's a nasty hack :D
[04:49:58] <decx> probably one of the weirdest things
[04:50:07] <delboy1978uk> lol not really, it uses the same element, and responsively changes solely through css. quite nice, really
[04:50:17] <decx> or should i say one of the beardest wings
[05:10:37] <delboy1978uk> awesome, it actually works incredibly well slax0r
[05:11:04] <decx> that's not a hack
[05:11:08] <Ankabout> I have something very strange... A selector is working in jsfiddle, but not on my site...
[05:11:09] <decx> that's just labels being awesome
[05:11:22] <decx> ?ftj
[05:11:23] <b-ot> decx: Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[05:11:35] <Ankabout> $(this).parent().siblings(".my-dv").show();  should work to select a DOM's "uncle" right?
[05:11:57] <decx> if it works in fiddle then you have a problem somewhere else
[05:12:02] <decx> but yes
[05:12:37] <Ankabout> http://jsfiddle.net/Lt63g41f/
[05:12:53] <Ankabout> that's the fiddle. I thought maybe there's some situation where this line of code might not work
[05:13:21] <decx> console.log all the things
[05:13:37] <mocsrox> given a dom element, how can one do a 'subselect' into that element?
[05:13:58] <decx> who in the what now?
[05:14:22] <delboy1978uk> $(‘#mydiv’).find(‘.innerdiv’)
[05:14:32] <delboy1978uk> mocsrox: something like that?
[05:15:19] <mocsrox> delboy1978uk: well i have the dom element.. lets say from something like var myElem = $('#some_id > .some_class')[0]
[05:15:38] <Ankabout> Oh I'm such an idiot... Found it.
[05:15:40] <mocsrox> now i would want to use myElem but select into it
[05:15:46] <Ankabout> My eyes were deceiving me
[05:16:08] <decx> myElem isnt a jquery object
[05:16:14] <mocsrox> e.g. $(myElem) but now find all .myFooClass from that
[05:16:28] <decx> if you just want the first .some_class in #some_id then use .eq(0)
[05:16:34] <delboy1978uk> $(myElem).find(‘.myFooClass’)
[05:16:40] <mocsrox> ah.
[05:16:44] <mocsrox> so
[05:16:59] <mocsrox> using .find is basically like the selector but just different syntax?
[05:17:18] <decx> it's like element.querySelector()
[05:17:25] <decx> in native
[05:17:25] <delboy1978uk> yeah if you already have a jquery object it lets you drill down deeper
[05:17:33] <mocsrox> perfect!
[05:17:45] <decx> still, why the [0]
[05:17:45] <mocsrox> thanks guys
[05:18:13] <mocsrox> decx: basically i want to loop over a certain query
[05:18:24] <decx> so?
[05:18:42] <mocsrox> oh you mean why not use .each
[05:18:45] <mocsrox> or something like that?
[05:18:50] <decx> not at all
[05:19:11] <decx> why get the vanilla element out of your jquery collection just to wrap it again for find?
[05:19:26] <mocsrox> m.
[05:19:29] <mocsrox> yeah thats true.
[05:45:02] <Brachamul> decx: thanks, that did it
[05:49:39] <tirengarfio> I  have an infinite carrousel inside the deep red area. The problem, when I clear the cache _sometimes_ the pictures are not show, any idea? this is the site: www.mytravelbanners.com
[05:49:58] <tirengarfio> I download the code from here: http://www.catchmyfame.com/jquery/infinitecarousel3/demo/d1.html
[05:51:12] <xelim> tirengarfio: when are you initializing the slider. document.ready?
[05:51:50] <tirengarfio> even using document ready (I tried it on my local computer) the images are not loaded sometimes..
[05:52:28] <xelim> tirengarfio: have you tried to init it on window.onload
[05:52:34] <tirengarfio> no
[05:52:37] <d[10]> https://jsfiddle.net/wxc1jsw4/ that jquery insert class .navbuttonnew but the propertie inline-block no...
[05:52:38] <tirengarfio> I will try it right now
[05:54:58] <dimi1947> I have an object like this one https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/wpnakf9e/5/ line 51
[05:55:25] <dimi1947> I can access it like this days.monday
[05:55:26] <d[10]> <li style="display: list-item;" class="navbuttonnew">
[05:56:29] <dimi1947> is there a way I can access it like this: days.weekday  where weekday is a var with the value of monday....I tried and I cannot...also this var is string type
[05:58:14] <tirengarfio> xelim, it seems it is working ok with window.onload
[05:58:57] <xelim> tirengarfio: that is happening because the images may not be loaded when you are initing the lib
[05:59:20] <xelim> window.onload makes sure that all the content is loaded and after that fires the event
[05:59:33] <xelim> keep that in mind ;)
[06:00:21] <flobin> so in an eventlistener you can specify a function to run, right? is it possible, in that function, to add a class to the element that the event listener was listening to? or am I thinking too complicated?
[06:00:43] <flobin> as in, I want to add a class to an input field on focus and remove it on blur
[06:01:01] <xelim> flobin: yes
[06:01:11] <flobin> I guess I could just do $(input).click?
[06:01:13] <xelim> you can do that ...
[06:02:15] <flobin> or rather $(input).focus($(this).addClass(“someclass”)); would that work?
[06:02:36] <xelim> flobin: no
[06:03:06] <xelim> $(input).focus(function() {$(this).addClass(“someclass”)});
[06:03:12] <xelim> that will work
[06:03:32] <flobin> oh right, thank you!
[06:12:32] <d[10]> https://jsfiddle.net/wxc1jsw4/2/ that jquery insert class .navbuttonnew but the propertie inline-block no...
[06:12:38] <d[10]> on console it's give
[06:12:48] <d[10]> insert automatic <li class="navbuttonnew" style="display: list-item;"></li>
[06:13:48] <xelim> d[10]: that is because of the fadeIn
[06:14:13] <d[10]> xelim: what i do ?
[06:16:57] <xelim> d[10]: $('.navbutton li').fadeIn(function() {(this).css('display', 'inline-block');});
[06:17:22] <xelim> but i suggest you refactor your code and use span elements or divs
[06:22:29] <ajf-> so is there a roadmap or anything that shows what to expect from jQuery 3 '
[06:22:30] <ajf-> ?
[06:31:33] <d[10]> xelim: ok, i want use .addClass, but is not possible in that css
[06:36:20] <cordovafan8> Hi. Is there an issue calling multiple asynchronous ajax calls with $.ajax() ? I'm seeing something odd. I will load a page, which has several delegated ajax calls, and if I load another page before those ajax requests are  complete, the ajax calls performed by the new page will be significantly slower. Am I missing something to make these functions truly async?
[06:46:08] <delboy1978uk> cordovafan8: if your server is doing some heavy work with each request then yes there could be a delay
[06:47:20] <delboy1978uk> for instance in my old work, a property place, they had a ‘draw a search’ ajax call where you could draw a polygon on the google map and it would find properties in that area.
[06:47:23] <cordovafan8> delboy1978uk: it's definitely not server side delay. The scripts execute in less than 1s, but I'm seeing a 2s additional client side delay
[06:47:56] <cordovafan8> go on, sorry I didn't mean ton interrupt
[06:48:01] <cordovafan8> to*
[06:48:02] <delboy1978uk> however, they didnt stop the zoom in and out on the map, and you could crash the server by drawing a box around the entire uk lol
[06:48:32] <delboy1978uk> and anyone else on another machine, their request got slow too
[06:48:41] <cordovafan8> hah
[06:48:44] <delboy1978uk> :P
[06:48:58] <delboy1978uk> but if its a 1s query that obviously isnt your problem
[06:49:22] <cordovafan8> so is the recommended practice to kill all incomplete ajax requests when you no longer need them?
[06:49:35] <cordovafan8> that seems extreme
[06:50:03] <delboy1978uk> ive never done that, so i’m not sure!

[06:57:39] <c0d3n4m3> Hey all, has anyone used jCrop here before?
[06:58:18] <microhaxo> How can i modify this waituntilexists extension to have a number of attempts timeout?   https://gist.github.com/buu700/4200601   I tried doing this: http://paste2.org/avApI1A7  but it re-assigns attempts variable every loop.
[06:59:08] <c0d3n4m3> I seem to be having a mac only issue, with jcrop_api.destroy being undefined.
[07:14:17] <xelim> microhaxo: where are you incrementing your attempt count?
[07:15:01] <microhaxo> xelim, i just figured it out: http://paste2.org/8dKWXVzb
[07:15:14] <microhaxo> I am only worried about concurrent calls, hopefully they are each new instances..
[07:18:02] <xelim> microhaxo: this points to the window object
[07:18:19] <xelim> so this.attempts is the same as window.attempts
[07:18:31] <microhaxo> is that bad?
[07:19:18] <xelim> first of you don't need that variable to be global
[07:19:35] <xelim> just define it locally `var attempts=0;`
[07:20:32] <xelim> and if you have several object using this extension ... they will use the same attempt variable
[07:20:43] <OnceMe> when I click on button and show new input field, its not focused

[07:42:42] <pagios> can someone check what is wrong with my jquery?
[07:42:43] <microhaxo> xelim: http://paste2.org/fE2CeF7K
[07:42:44] <pagios> http://pastie.org/10219421
[07:42:55] <pagios> the event does not fire
[07:43:25] <jedrek> demo?
[07:43:31] <jedrek> i mean, put it on jsfiddle
[07:44:00] <pagios> jedrek: it uses this library https://github.com/Mottie/Keyboard/wiki/Setup
[07:44:09] <pagios> duno how to put it on jsfiddle with it
[07:44:46] <xelim> pagios: it fires on my fiddle
[07:44:59] <pagios> the keyboard too?
[07:45:20] <xelim> pagios: http://jsfiddle.net/162wazj1/
[07:45:32] <xelim> no the keyboard is not defined
[07:45:34] <jayjo> What should be the limiting factor when I have an ajax call check the status of something every 5 seconds or so - is it bad for the client machine or should I be worried about my server accepting too many requests and getting bogged down?
[07:45:39] <xelim> i'm testing it on chrome
[07:45:47] <d[10]> Does anyone know any function that does the effect .click show or hide ?
[07:46:10] <xelim> microhaxo: should it be called only once?
[07:47:47] <microhaxo> Well, sometimes the dom isn't ready and doesn't find the element, so i wanted to give it a few attempts before giving up. It works but when i do it to a few elements eventually it just never goes into the function even though the result has data.
[07:48:52] <xelim> microhaxo: if (attempts >= allowedNumberOfAttempts) {window.clearInterval(window.waitUntilExists_Intervals[this.selector]); $this.data('wait-attempts', 0);}
[07:48:59] <xelim> have you added this?
[07:50:49] <microhaxo> Yes, i basically took the whole fiddle
[07:52:15] <limpc> hi, is there a limit on the type of content you can append to a page using .append() ?
[07:52:25] <pagios> xelim: should the html file  be loaded on a webbrowser? coz i am trying on a local file
[07:52:34] <limpc> im obtaining some html via an ajax call, and am trying to append it to a div. but nothing appears. it's a complex html structure
[07:53:29] <limpc> er nm figured out my problem
[07:53:40] <xelim> pagios: what do you mean local file?
[07:54:40] <xelim> microhaxo: hmm ... well it shouldn't do that
[07:55:43] <microhaxo> xelim: its something goofy. What im doing is highlighting words and am clicking next, next etc. When i get to the end it should go back to the top and re-highlight. The selector is called but the function never gets executed.. Really frustrating,.
[07:55:57] <d[10]> https://jsfiddle.net/po67dvb4/ why i need two click to see the effect ?
[08:00:37] <xelim> microhaxo: that probably has to do with the attempts ... try tracking the attempts
[08:00:52] <Xatenev> d[10]: ?
[08:01:05] <Xatenev> cause the ul is noot hidden
[08:06:47] <MikeD_> var meas = $(evt.target).  .find('.value');   console.log( JSON.stringify(meas) );  I see an obect with properties 0,1,2,3... 17 (as I expect) but those objects are {}  <-- can someone explain what that means? (i'm confused)
[08:07:56] <decx> what's the event target?
[08:08:14] <MikeD_> a button i clicked on to start that function
[08:08:31] <decx> well check if that's actually the target
[08:08:45] <decx> the target is whatever you clicked
[08:08:56] <MikeD_> var meas = $(evt.target).closest('.tester').find('.meas').find('.value');
[08:09:04] <decx> ah with a a closest
[08:09:06] <decx> there you go
[08:09:13] <MikeD_> ?
[08:09:22] <decx> fiddle up
[08:10:09] <MikeD_> can you tell me why my expectation of non-empty objects was wrong?
[08:12:40] <cordovafan8> Does anyone know if overlapping asynchronous ajax queries could delay one another?
[08:13:02] <kackl_000_> Can anyone give me direction on resizing a select to 80%
[08:13:44] <kackl_000_> When I try width:80% as an inline style it doesn't even work
[08:15:37] <MikeD_> http://jsfiddle.net/acmzf66d/
[08:16:08] <MikeD_> kackl_000_: does the parent have an explicit width?
[08:17:22] <kackl_000_> MikeD_, no it does not.  I'm assuming you are saying that is necessary for the percentage to work?
[08:18:38] <d[10]> Xatenev: i dont understand
[08:19:38] <d[10]> Xatenev: hidden?
[08:21:47] <kackl_000_> MikeD_, nevermind it looks like it was a quoting problem
[08:21:50] <d[10]> https://jsfiddle.net/po67dvb4/ why i need two click to see the effect ?
[08:22:42] <MikeD_> decx: can you explain now that I made an example?
[08:23:42] <decx> well that's not empty now is it
[08:24:08] <MikeD_> "0":{}  <-- is that not an empty object?
[08:24:38] <Wildling_IceCrea> Hi. If I've got the following code  `function foo(){ var x = 1; getSomethingByPromise().then(function() { console.log(x); }  }` - x will be undefined. why? and how could I rearrange the code so that I could reach the x variable from inside the then-function?
[08:25:14] <BillCriswell> Wildling_IceCrea: Interview question?
[08:25:17] <MikeD_> damn, now i see... i have to wrap the object in $( )
[08:25:54] <Uhkis> {} is an empty object
[08:25:59] <Wildling_IceCrea> BillCriswell: nope, just trying to figure out why my code started breaking after introducing promises
[08:26:00] <sadtaco> It's not in the scope of the promise.
[08:26:10] <sadtaco> I forgot how to fix it
[08:26:10] <robertmaxrees> Wildling_IceCrea you mean like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L3d2vqqj/
[08:26:15] <robertmaxrees> because your code wasn't valid before.
[08:26:30] <MikeD_> shouldn't your promise resolve with some data?
[08:26:37] <robertmaxrees> ^
[08:26:39] <MikeD_> shouldn't the handler function accept some data?
[08:26:48] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily, but generally.
[08:26:56] <Wildling_IceCrea> robertmaxrees: exactly like that
[08:27:05] <decx> i dont even get what stringify on an element is supposed to do?
[08:27:05] <MikeD_> well right, if you WANT data, you should expect to handle some :P
[08:27:26] <Wildling_IceCrea> MikeD_: ususally, but I removed it since the data was irrelevant in this case
[08:27:37] <Wildling_IceCrea> *usually
[08:27:46] <kackl_000_> When I do google searches for jquery mobile I find good documentation for old versions like this one for example: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.0rc2/docs/forms/selects/ where it's very thorough with text.  Is there an equivalent source for 1.4.5 docs?  I see the demos like this: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/selectmenu/ but it's jsut examples and no explinations
[08:27:48] <robertmaxrees> Wildling_IceCrea that should work, either way.
[08:28:07] <MikeD_> decx: i just wanted to see it.  i think JSON.stringify() makes assumptions about jquery objects that aren't exactly the same as jquery assumptions
[08:28:14] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquerymobile.com/ kackl_000_
[08:28:23] <decx> it'll return empty on meas.get() just as well
[08:28:25] <MikeD_> http://jsfiddle.net/acmzf66d/1/
[08:28:45] <Wildling_IceCrea> robertmaxrees: should work without any data returned from the promise, yes. But what about the scoping? how do I access x?
[08:28:57] <robertmaxrees> Wildling_IceCrea you should have access to x.
[08:29:01] <robertmaxrees> let me triple check though.
[08:29:23] <kackl_000_> robertmaxrees, Maybe I'm missing it.  Cause I did look there but say I want to find the select form item for example I didn't see it there
[08:29:50] <robertmaxrees> kackl_000_ you mean http://api.jquerymobile.com/category/all/ ?
[08:30:22] <kackl_000_> robertmaxrees, thanks!  I see it now
[08:30:27] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L3d2vqqj/1/ Wildling_IceCrea
[08:32:38] <d[10]> https://jsfiddle.net/po67dvb4/ why i need two click to see the effect ?
[08:36:52] <Wildling_IceCrea> robertmaxrees: damn, you're right. x is accessible... must be some other issue with my real code
[08:37:07] <Wildling_IceCrea> thanks for the help
[08:40:36] <robertmaxrees> Wildling_IceCrea something tells me you're setting x to the return of an async function.
[08:42:40] <robertmaxrees> d[10] are you trying to have this toggle the visibility of something?
[08:53:15] <kackl_000_> I can't seem to get a placeholder value working, any tips? http://jsfiddle.net/9zf13d6g/
[08:53:50] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9zf13d6g/1/
[08:55:08] <kackl_000_> Thanks robertmaxrees
[08:55:34] <robertmaxrees> check out the section titled "placeholder options" here for more - http://api.jquerymobile.com/selectmenu/
[08:56:08] <microhaxo> I've got a fun one. Jquery selector finds a result but the dom isn't quite done loading content in, my addClass never gets applied.. Any suggestions? It doesn't happen all the time but if i ajax in a decent amount of content then call addclass on an element, it finds it but doesn't reflect it in ui.
[08:56:35] <robertmaxrees> microhaxo run your stuff in the done() callback of the ajax call.
[08:56:47] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax().done(function() { /* your code here */ });
[08:57:02] <kackl_000_> robertmaxrees, I think the documentation is wrong because it says "An option with a data-placeholder="true" attribute. (This allows you to use an option that has a value and a textnode as a placeholder option)."
[08:57:16] <robertmaxrees> kackl_000_ you weren't using it correctly.
[08:57:18] <robertmaxrees> the docs are right.
[08:57:28] <microhaxo> robertmaxrees: I am.
[08:57:44] <robertmaxrees> microhaxo then something else is up.
[08:57:51] <robertmaxrees> kackl_000_ let me poke again.  one sec.
[09:02:15] <kackl_000_> robertmaxrees, let me know what you come up with.
[09:02:18] <robertmaxrees> hrmmm..
[09:02:21] <robertmaxrees> something here isn'
[09:02:25] <robertmaxrees> *isn't adding up.
[09:02:41] <kackl_000_> It was driving me crazy
[09:05:46] <robertmaxrees> kackl_000_ this looks like a problem with jsfiddle maybe?
[09:06:14] <kackl_000_> I had same problem in my development environment
[09:06:21] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8j58od0n/1/
[09:06:26] <robertmaxrees> docs work just fine.  no clue.
[09:06:48] <kackl_000_> Maybe jquery version?
[09:07:07] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't matter, but maybe it does?
[09:07:30] <Lencl> hello
[09:07:44] <rubyonrailed> I'm using the numeric jquery plugin to only allow numeric entrys in some inputs.  So I have something that looks like this: `$('.pir").numeric();`  This works fine for most of my .pir inputs, but I render some via Ajax and numeric does not work with them.  How can I expand it to work with ajax rendered inputs?
[09:08:03] <Lencl> if a user clicks anywhere on $('body')... I want to do function A. but I want to give an exception for element <div>
[09:08:06] <robertmaxrees> rubyonrailed initialize them in your .done() of the ajax call.
[09:08:07] <Lencl> what's the best way ?
[09:08:28] <rubyonrailed> robertmaxrees: Thanks
[09:08:47] <dimi1947> is there any way I can check in an element is visible or not?
[09:09:15] <robertmaxrees> Lencl use $('body').on('click', function(e) { }); and check if $(e.target).is('.yourDiv') or $(e.target).closest('.yourDiv')
[09:09:25] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 sure.  lots of ways
[09:09:38] <dimi1947> tell me one...

[09:10:12] <Lencl> ah ok thanks
[09:10:56] <dimi1947> thanks robertmaxtrees
[09:11:19] <dimi1947> is there an easy way typing user names here in this client?
[09:11:31] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 what client are you using?
[09:11:39] <dimi1947> HydraIRC
[09:11:41] <robertmaxrees> most clients offer tab autocomplete.
[09:12:20] <ddod> Weird request: How do I generate a jquery selector string (e.g. '#elem') from an element (e.g. $(elem)) without any assumptions that there will be an element ID or other simple identifying features?
[09:12:28] <robertmaxrees> ddod huh?
[09:12:53] <dimi1947> I see that but it is inconvenient to cycle through all the username till I find which I want....anyway if this is the only way...so be it
[09:13:09] <ddod> robertmaxrees: If I have an element in my code, say $(elem) and want to reference it as a string, say $('div:nth(4)')
[09:13:12] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 you can usually start typing the name and then tab complete from there.
[09:13:39] <dimi1947> yes that is beetter
[09:13:41] <dimi1947> thanks
[09:13:44] <robertmaxrees> ddod you already have the object - why are you trying to reselect it?
[09:13:58] <ddod> for templating into a string for an onclick event
[09:14:05] <robertmaxrees> ddod wat
[09:14:12] <dimi1947> thanks robertmaxrees testing testing
[09:14:16] <ddod> converting to html
[09:14:18] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need to do that.  can you setup a fiddle showing what you're doing?
[09:15:07] <d[10]> [12:40] <robertmaxrees> d[10] are you trying to have this toggle the visibility of something?
[09:15:07] <ddod> robertmaxrees: okay, so if I am generating the html, could I generate it as jquery nodes that each have an onclick listener before I append them to the dom?
[09:15:09] <d[10]> what ?
[09:15:26] <robertmaxrees> d[10] your question barely made sense.  i was trying to understand what you're trying to do.
[09:15:36] <robertmaxrees> ddod you shouldn't give them onclick listeners directly
[09:15:41] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener insted
[09:15:58] <ddod> what do you mean?
[09:16:06] <decx> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/

[09:16:17] <d[10]> robertmaxrees: When the page loads I need to give 2 clicks in button
[09:16:30] <robertmaxrees> d[10] right, what's the original intent of your code?
[09:16:32] <decx> ?delegate should be a thing
[09:16:43] <robertmaxrees> `delegate
[09:16:47] <robertmaxrees> hrmmm...
[09:17:01] <d[10]> robertmaxrees: give 1 click on button...
[09:17:19] <d[10]> robertmaxrees:  run the code
[09:17:23] <robertmaxrees> d[10] that's not what i'm asking.  what is the original intent of your code?  hide/show something?
[09:17:42] <d[10]> the first click, u need give 2 clicks to load correct ul
[09:17:43] <d[10]> https://jsfiddle.net/po67dvb4/
[09:17:54] <robertmaxrees> ... i give up duder.
[09:18:03] <d[10]> robertmaxrees: hide and show
[09:19:41] <robertmaxrees> so first off, start here: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/po67dvb4/2/
[09:19:49] <robertmaxrees> invert your logic - bind the listener the right wayl.
[09:20:15] <ceramicskull> Is there a jquery for hire?
[09:20:31] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull assuming you mean a developer, this isn't the right place.
[09:20:45] <ceramicskull> I meant to add channel
[09:20:57] <ceramicskull> but my brain told my finger to hit enter before hand
[09:21:02] <d[10]> robertmaxrees: wait
[09:21:14] <robertmaxrees> d[10] so now you can troubleshoot like this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/po67dvb4/3/
[09:21:20] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull huh?
[09:21:37] <ceramicskull> So let me re-phrase, is there a jquery developer for hire channel? lol
[09:22:03] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull there's no such thing as a "jquery developer" :) either way, check out a freelance channel?
[09:22:51] <robertmaxrees> the problem with looking for devs on freenode is that the network is more geared towards OSS and similar projects, so looking for someone to pay can be a bit of a challenge.
[09:23:24] <ceramicskull> well it is open source, but I just need help displaying some data, it pops out in the console log fine, but when
[09:23:47] <ceramicskull> I try to append to a div, it comes back null ._.
[09:23:49] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull if you want help writing it yourself, this is the right place.
[09:23:54] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, head over to #freelance.
[09:25:46] <ceramicskull> Currently it's an optimizely application - they let you download a CSV of the data, but I'm trying to make it display rather than download.
[09:27:22] <robertmaxrees> not sure you can do that without a server of your own.\
[09:27:36] <robertmaxrees> need to serve up the file instead of prompting the user for a download.
[09:29:46] <d[10]> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/po67dvb4/3/
[09:29:49] <d[10]> wrong code
[09:29:53] <d[10]> dont run
[09:30:05] <robertmaxrees> i'm aware it doesn't do what you want it to - try debugging it from there :)

[09:31:10] <Uhkis> thanks for ruining irc :|
[09:31:23] <robertmaxrees> d[10] open your console and go from there.
[09:31:24] <gambl0re> if (!$(event.target).is('button')) { ---- does the ! = not ?... if event.target is not a button?
[09:31:43] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re yep.
[09:33:15] <gambl0re> does this work? ($(event.target) != ('button'))
[09:33:20] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:33:23] <robertmaxrees> need the .is() there.
[09:33:25] <gambl0re> but why?
[09:33:33] <robertmaxrees> because ('button') evaluates to a string.
[09:33:41] <robertmaxrees> $(event.target) is a jquery object.
[09:33:47] <decx> even $('button') wouldnt cut it
[09:33:52] <robertmaxrees> ^ yep.
[09:33:53] <decx> you see $() != $()
[09:33:59] <robertmaxrees> yep yep.
[09:34:30] <damasceno> Does anyone know how to create a scroll if the number of lines is bigger than X? I know I can create it using scrollTop: $("#posts_view").scrollTop(10) but I need to declare if the amount of lines in the table is bigger than 5 (For example) create a scroll. Thanks.
[09:34:32] <decx> the native way isnt that complicated either
[09:34:40] <decx> if (event.target && event.target.nodeName == 'BUTTON')
[09:35:10] <robertmaxrees> damasceno do what now?
[09:35:13] <robertmaxrees> you mean table rows?
[09:35:22] <decx> is this still about the tooltip?
[09:35:31] <decx> changing channels i see ^^
[09:35:43] <gambl0re> (!$(event.target).is('button'))     --- this is comparing a jquery object to a string? so you have to use .is()
[09:35:51] <d[10]> robertmaxrees: i can't ;X
[09:35:55] <decx> damasceno: http://jsfiddle.net/t4s7Ly3v/2/
[09:35:59] <d[10]> i'm trying but is hard
[09:36:08] <decx> damasceno: specifically tt.style.top = this.offsetTop - sidebar.scrollTop + 'px';
[09:36:32] <gambl0re> if ($(event.target).is('button'))       ---- would this work if i wanted to check if event.target is a button?
[09:36:35] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re that's checking if $(event.target) matches that selector.
[09:36:40] <robertmaxrees> d[10] what are you confused by?
[09:36:50] <Uhkis> this decx and his vanilla code
[09:37:01] <decx> they asked the question in another channel
[09:37:01] <damasceno> decx: thanks mate! thanks!
[09:37:13] <d[10]> robertmaxrees: it's correct code
[09:37:13] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[09:37:16] <d[10]> ;/
[09:37:19] <robertmaxrees> d[10] it's not actually.
[09:38:23] <d[10]> robertmaxrees: you said of getattributenode() ?
[09:38:23] <gambl0re> .is('selector')???
[09:38:34] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re check the docs, duder.
[09:38:40] <robertmaxrees> d[10] huh?
[09:39:08] <d[10]> robertmaxrees: you speak of getattributenode() ?
[09:39:14] <d[10]> it's the error on console
[09:39:21] <robertmaxrees> d[10] what?
[09:39:26] <robertmaxrees> i didn't say anything about that.
[09:39:31] <robertmaxrees> your code obviously doesn't work :)

[09:41:49] <ceramicskull> robertmaxrees
[09:42:00] <robertmaxrees> ugh jsbin.
[09:42:12] <decx> more like hasbeen amirite
[09:42:16] <decx> o/
[09:42:19] <decx> \o
[09:42:25] <robertmaxrees> (boom)
[09:43:04] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull so what's supposed to break here?
[09:43:58] <jQuery> so I'm using java query version 1.5 and would like to add order to jQuery.cssNumber how I can I do that with not causing issues in version bigger than or equal to 1.10 please answer me
[09:44:10] <robertmaxrees> jQuery it's not "java query"
[09:44:14] <robertmaxrees> and you need to update.
[09:44:15] <arthurvr> Java query? Our things is called jQuery and is all about javascript.
[09:44:17] <decx> hey that's a new one
[09:44:33] <ceramicskull> well, I want to append that data in html
[09:44:43] <decx> what you mean is java quarry
[09:44:43] <ceramicskull> but when I do, it comes back null
[09:44:45] <decx> that's just minecraft
[09:44:58] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull show me where it does that.
[09:45:03] <robertmaxrees> because i'm seeing the data in the console.
[09:45:11] <robertmaxrees> show me a broken version, basically.
[09:45:13] <robertmaxrees> brb
[09:45:15] <ceramicskull> Ah ok
[09:45:26] <arthurvr> jQuery: If there’s something preventing you from updating (I’d like to know what?) but it’s as easy as jQuery.cssNumber[‘order’] = true; that won’t cause issues in later versions.
[09:46:11] <jQuery> so jQuery isn't java query? abbr for javascript query then?
[09:46:47] <randomguy1> never seen javascript abbreviated to java
[09:46:53] <randomguy1> that'd just be confusing
[09:47:42] <jQuery> I don't get this whole confusion. My co worker told me jQuery is short for "java-query"
[09:47:45] <snover> trolol
[09:47:59] <randomguy1> just roll your eyes and carry on your day
[09:47:59] <jQuery> arthurvr: I'll try that line
[09:48:13] <snover> to be fair to your coworker they are probably accidentally correct
[09:48:28] <snover> there was a java library that existed before jQuery called jquery
[09:48:36] <d[10]> robertmaxrees: no error's on firebug
[09:48:47] <arthurvr> Yes there was. 10 years ago.
[09:48:49] <ceramicskull> robertmaxrees nvm im an idiot thanks
[09:49:20] <jQuery> sorry for the noobish question I'm just new to ember development.
[09:49:47] <HoNgOuRu> hi, I have a problem getting an attribute from a row... If I try the selector in the firebug console it works, if I do from the function file it doesn't ...
[09:50:05] <arthurvr> trolllll
[09:50:12] <HoNgOuRu> I want to access the tr of the td clicked, but the table is inside a div
[09:50:30] <randomguy1> HoNgOuRu: console log the object itself and make sure you are getting it selected.  It may not exist at the time that function executes
[09:50:58] <HoNgOuRu> randomguy1, but I made sure of running after document ready
[09:51:04] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees, are you still there?
[09:51:15] <randomguy1> HoNgOuRu: is the element created dynamically?
[09:51:15] <HoNgOuRu> I load the table and then click the td
[09:51:21] <HoNgOuRu> randomguy1, yes
[09:51:40] <HoNgOuRu> I didn't took that into consideration
[09:51:55] <randomguy1> HoNgOuRu: you got a fiddle or something we could look over?
[09:52:01] <dimi1947> besides checking the visibility of an element with is(:visible) what other ways are available?
[09:52:05] <HoNgOuRu> It could be that... so firebug console works with already loaded content
[09:52:13] <HoNgOuRu> mmm...
[09:52:22] <robertmaxrees> back
[09:52:30] <HoNgOuRu> Ill try to fix it if its only order of functions
[09:52:30] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 that's how you do it.
[09:52:33] <ceramicskull> yea dont worry about it lol
[09:52:38] <randomguy1> HoNgOuRu: k
[09:52:46] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 otherwise, what's up?
[09:52:56] <ceramicskull> I missed the . in my selector
[09:52:57] <ceramicskull> D:
[09:53:04] <dimi1947> you mean what is the problem I am facing
[09:53:11] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 yes.
[09:54:04] <dimi1947> well I am not sure if you can  help me...it relates with a backbone plugin about validation....i just want the va;idation to run only if the element in question is visible
[09:55:28] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 if it's possible to setup a simplified test case i'd suggest it, otherwise it sounds like you need to rethink your approach.
[09:56:12] <dimi1947> what do you mean...rething my approach...can you be more specific?
[09:56:34] <randomguy1> what is the use case for not validating hidden elements?
[09:57:10] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you're misapplying something.
[09:57:31] <robertmaxrees> like, why doesn't .is(':visible') work in this case?
[09:58:22] <HoNgOuRu> randomguy1, I write the table
[09:58:26] <HoNgOuRu> with ajax
[09:58:40] <dimi1947> probably there must be an issue with the plugin
[09:58:42] <HoNgOuRu> inside the document ready function
[09:58:59] <randomguy1> HoNgOuRu: ok, so if your trying to access it outside of the done() callback, it wouldn't be guarenteed to be there yet
[09:59:06] <randomguy1> err success()
[09:59:38] <HoNgOuRu> done() ?
[09:59:44] <HoNgOuRu> Im new to jquery
[09:59:44] <randomguy1> success
[09:59:59] <HoNgOuRu> oh.. from the ajax call
[10:00:12] <randomguy1> $.ajax({ url: "blah", data: {}, success: function(data){ /* whatever */}})
[10:00:31] <randomguy1> yeah
[10:00:40] <HoNgOuRu> I use simple js to do the ajax
[10:00:48] <HoNgOuRu> and then execute document ready
[10:01:01] <HoNgOuRu> and then the click event inside jquery
[10:01:45] <randomguy1> can you create a fiddle por favor?
[10:01:47] <randomguy1> !paste
[10:01:47] <b-ot> randomguy1: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:02:09] <HoNgOuRu> ok
[10:04:03] <HoNgOuRu> randomguy1, https://jsfiddle.net/9tv5fms4/
[10:04:54] <randomguy1> oh
[10:04:59] <randomguy1> don't use attr to get data elements
[10:05:03] <randomguy1> use data()
[10:05:16] <randomguy1> and leave off the data- prefix on the key
[10:06:48] <HoNgOuRu> randomguy1, it works in the console
[10:07:15] <robertmaxrees> "it works" is always terrible reasoning.
[10:07:19] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem here?
[10:07:42] <randomguy1> he's getting a null when trying to get his data attribute on a click event it seems
[10:08:02] <robertmaxrees> var rowID = $(this).closest('tr').attr('data-fila-id'); this line?
[10:08:15] <randomguy1> that's my assumption
[10:08:36] <robertmaxrees> uh, that code won't work unless you use a delegated listener.
[10:09:02] <HoNgOuRu> robertmaxrees, that line works ok when trying from the firebug console
[10:09:11] <robertmaxrees> right, because that's after the content has loaded in.
[10:09:16] <HoNgOuRu> but doesn't when running from the browser
[10:09:17] <robertmaxrees> you cann't bind to things that don't exist.
[10:09:22] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[10:09:32] <randomguy1> he's saying the click event isn't being attached, as the element does not exist yet when you try to bind
[10:09:49] <robertmaxrees> right
[10:09:58] <randomguy1> so the logic works
[10:10:05] <robertmaxrees> but the binding doesn't.
[10:10:06] <randomguy1> but it doesn't actually execute
[10:10:11] <HoNgOuRu> ok, so that is why it works with undefined result when switching td with #tabla
[10:10:24] <HoNgOuRu> cause div id=tabla exists
[10:10:26] <robertmaxrees> kind of.
[10:10:26] <HoNgOuRu> ok
[10:10:34] <robertmaxrees> read the page i linked.
[10:10:40] <robertmaxrees> it explains it.
[10:10:40] <HoNgOuRu> robertmaxrees, ok
[10:10:53] <HoNgOuRu> robertmaxrees, randomguy1 thanks for your help...
[10:10:58] <HoNgOuRu> I'LL BE BACK !
[10:11:15] <randomguy1> hey, have some faith, you may not need to, :)
[10:13:28] <HoNgOuRu> is $().click(function the same as $().on('click', function()      ???????
[10:13:35] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[10:13:37] <HoNgOuRu> ok
[10:13:42] <robertmaxrees> the former actually uses the latter under the hood.
[10:13:46] <robertmaxrees> but thats not a delegated listener.
[10:13:55] <HoNgOuRu> no no.. I know
[10:14:06] <HoNgOuRu> It was just one thing on my mind
[10:14:09] <robertmaxrees> just making sure :)
[10:20:12] <gambl0re> if (event.target == this) {    ----.target  is referring to the selector?
[10:21:53] <decx> target is whatever you clicked
[10:22:24] <gambl0re> i mean (this) is referring to the selector..
[10:22:39] <randomguy1> unless it's a delegate
[10:22:43] <decx>  that's the element
[10:22:52] <gambl0re> event.target is checking to see if its the selected element.
[10:23:16] <gambl0re> randomguy1 why are you always trying to confuse things..
[10:23:27] <randomguy1> not black and white, :)
[10:23:36] <decx> if you have a span in a div and you have a clickhandler on your div but click the span then this is the div, but e.target is the span
[10:24:58] <gambl0re> 'this' is the div
[10:25:11] <gambl0re> span == div
[10:25:19] <randomguy1> $(selector).on('click', function(){ /* this is the selector */});
[10:25:24] <randomguy1> $(selector).on('click', function(){ /* this is the selector */});
[10:25:33] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/ush7tmqv/
[10:25:33] <randomguy1> $(selector).on('click', '.red', function(){ /* this is the red selector */});
[10:27:06] <randomguy1> so only doing logic if event.target == this would prevent delegates for processing, unless the delegated element was what caused the event
[10:27:11] <gambl0re> if(event.target == this) {}....event.target is whatever you clicked. this is the selector? coreect/incorrect?
[10:27:26] <decx> it's pretty obvious n the fiddle i posted isnt it
[10:27:34] <HoNgOuRu> I tried $('td').on('click','td',function and  $('#tabla').on('click','td',function .... don't work
[10:28:02] <gambl0re> am i right or wrong?.
[10:28:34] <randomguy1> HoNgOuRu: what element are you inserting the table into?
[10:28:52] <randomguy1> are you just adding it to the body?
[10:28:57] <randomguy1> or does it have a container element
[10:29:14] <HoNgOuRu> div id="tabla"
[10:29:28] <gambl0re> holy cow...cant even get a simple answer. thanks anyways.
[10:29:47] <decx> i gave you an example
[10:29:57] <randomguy1> so your ajax inserts the result into <div id="tabla"></div> which exists already when the page is loaded?
[10:30:45] <HoNgOuRu> I generate the table and its rows from php
[10:30:53] <HoNgOuRu> inside a div
[10:30:58] <HoNgOuRu> with id tabla
[10:31:14] <HoNgOuRu> randomguy1, yes to your question.
[10:31:54] <randomguy1> ok so the delegate would be something like: $('#tabla').on('click', 'someselector', function(){ /* do your stuff */ });
[10:31:59] <ramsub07> hello guys, I'm using $.post() to post data to a URL. My backend is in such a way that it will return a file as a response to the POST. how do i get the file and trigger a download ?
[10:32:13] <randomguy1> ajax doesn't play nice with downlods
[10:33:06] <randomguy1> two solutions would be to do an actual form submit to the back end, which will do the download, or have the ajax return a rediret url that you can open in a new window or an iframe
[10:33:19] <randomguy1> (hidden) iframe
[10:33:44] <randomguy1> others may know fancier ways
[10:35:39] <HoNgOuRu> randomguy1, it doesn't work...
[10:35:58] <randomguy1> what's the event handler your using?
[10:36:04] <HoNgOuRu> I tried $("#tabla").on("click","tr",func...
[10:36:18] <randomguy1> what's your func...
[10:36:18] <HoNgOuRu> sorry tr not, td
[10:36:32] <randomguy1> update your fiddle?
[10:36:44] <HoNgOuRu>  $("#tabla").on("click", "td", (function() {
[10:36:44] <HoNgOuRu>                 var rowID = $(this).closest('tr').data('fila-id');
[10:36:44] <HoNgOuRu>                 alert(rowID);
[10:36:44] <HoNgOuRu>               }));
[10:36:50] <HoNgOuRu> :)
[10:37:38] <randomguy1> uh, shouldn't matter, but take off the () around the function.  comment your var and alert lines and do a console.log and make sure that happens when you click the item
[10:37:54] <HoNgOuRu> ok
[10:39:00] <HoNgOuRu> randomguy1, I did it... just prints undefined
[10:39:06] <randomguy1> but it happens
[10:39:15] <HoNgOuRu> it actually calls yes, but only the #tabla
[10:39:31] <HoNgOuRu> Im not sure the td is called ever
[10:39:41] <randomguy1> do console.log(this) and see what that is
[10:40:22] <HoNgOuRu> randomguy1, its the td
[10:40:26] <HoNgOuRu> so it works
[10:40:29] <HoNgOuRu> now
[10:40:54] <randomguy1> now start stepping, next do $(this).closest('tr')[0]
[10:41:15] <HoNgOuRu> why $(this).closest('tr').data('fila-id) shows undefined ?
[10:41:28] <randomguy1> try $(this).closest('tr')[0]
[10:41:33] <decx> tr might be missing the data attribute
[10:41:38] <randomguy1> if it does print it, make sure that data element is there
[10:42:50] <randomguy1> and just to make sure it has been said, it should be data-fila-id="something" on the tr, but you look it up with data('fila-id')
[10:42:52] <HoNgOuRu> randomguy1, I know what was wrong now
[10:43:07] <HoNgOuRu> I think it was the data() function
[10:43:19] <HoNgOuRu> I did data('fila-id')
[10:43:23] <HoNgOuRu> undefined
[10:43:41] <HoNgOuRu> now if type attr('fila-id') works.
[10:43:52] <randomguy1> look at my last statement
[10:44:26] <HoNgOuRu> randomguy1, no, I took out "data-" from the php
[10:44:32] <randomguy1> you need it on the element
[10:44:35] <randomguy1> just not in the lookup
[10:44:38] <randomguy1> if you use data()
[10:45:19] <HoNgOuRu> again, the tr has fila-id="something" not data-fila-id="something"
[10:45:27] <randomguy1> you need the latter
[10:45:37] <HoNgOuRu> data-fila-id ?
[10:45:38] <HoNgOuRu> ok
[10:45:40] <randomguy1> yes
[10:45:42] <HoNgOuRu> ok
[10:45:48] <decx> you're not allowed to add attributes willy nilly
[10:45:55] <decx> that's what data-* is there for
[10:46:03] <decx> so people stop abusing the rel attr
[10:46:11] <decx> poor rel
[10:46:15] <randomguy1> lol
[10:46:21] <decx> been screwed from all angles over the years
[10:46:25] <HoNgOuRu> I got it now
[10:46:29] <randomguy1> :)
[10:46:30] <HoNgOuRu> I understood what you said
[10:46:33] <HoNgOuRu> its kinky
[10:46:49] <randomguy1> well just think about it, data() only collects attributes starting with data-*
[10:46:51] <HoNgOuRu> so if use data() remove use the parameter without 'data-'
[10:46:56] <randomguy1> so it's an unnecessary prefix for the lookup
[10:46:58] <HoNgOuRu> if use attr the whole thing
[10:47:07] <decx> without double entendre i don't survive irc
[10:47:22] <HoNgOuRu> randomguy1, ok, this sucks bad !
[10:47:37] <randomguy1> that's a 'feature', :P
[10:47:41] <HoNgOuRu> things are easier in c
[10:48:04] <decx> it makes sense when oyu get the gist of it
[10:48:34] <HoNgOuRu> randomguy1, so why shouldn't be using attr() ?
[10:48:48] <randomguy1> i'll defer that to others
[10:49:26] <HoNgOuRu> I'll stick to attr. I preffer both sides with the same name
[10:49:32] <decx> if you call the data() method then the dataset of the element will be saved in $._cache this gives more options for data like functions, element references or whatever you want
[10:50:16] <HoNgOuRu> decx, I see...
[10:50:24] <HoNgOuRu> so its better to use data() ?
[10:50:27] <decx> yes
[10:50:38] <HoNgOuRu> ok
[10:50:41] <randomguy1> prop() and data() :)
[10:50:56] <decx> right attr() has very limited usecases
[10:51:33] <HoNgOuRu> ok... Im reading attr vs data now... thanks
[10:55:47] <HoNgOuRu> if I use data-filaID and data(filaID) it doesn't work, but If I do data-fila-id and data(fila-id) it does.. WTF
[10:56:03] <randomguy1> the keys go all lowercase i believe
[10:56:09] <HoNgOuRu> ok
[10:56:28] <HoNgOuRu> you guys are quicker than google
[10:56:46] <randomguy1> you remember the problems, ;)
[10:57:06] <decx> it's a limitation of the dataset domstringmap
[10:59:27] <decx> dashes aren't valid in keys so stuff-stuff becomes stuffStuff
[10:59:43] <randomguy1> didn't know that one
[10:59:44] <decx> jquery normalizes that as best as it can, what a chump
[11:00:07] <decx> champ*
[11:00:16] <randomguy1> lol
[11:00:27] <randomguy1> very diverse typo
[11:00:34] <decx> not even a typo
[11:00:45] <decx> i'm just so inclined to use negative words
[11:00:46] <randomguy1> freudian?
[11:41:00] <os-11258> I have a json response being sent to a javascript for parsing, and populating a form based on output from a php script; however JSON.parse(json) doesn't seem to want to do anything; neither does $.parseJSON(json). will someone take a look: http://pastebin.com/2s4izDg0
[11:41:34] <rindolf> Hi all.
[11:41:54] <os-11258> hi rindolf
[11:42:18] <shoky> os-11258: with dataType: 'json' you should already be getting a json object. no need to parse it
[11:42:31] <rindolf> os-11258: how are you?
[11:42:53] <os-11258> oh duh. thanks shoky
[11:49:23] <Respek> hi all, I have a bit of psuedo code on line 12 of this fiddle, that I'm having a hard time solving. http://jsfiddle.net/respek/d1e9j8dn/3/
[11:49:42] <Respek> essentially I just want to take the existing placeholder, and prepend a space, if the browser is firefox
[11:50:25] <Respek> I'm like 90% of the way there, but how does one save the placeholder attr to a string, prepend a space and then set it to be the placeholder?
[11:51:41] <randomguy1> Respek: try $(selector).prop('placeholder', $(selector).prop('placeholder') +' ');
[11:52:08] <Respek> well that
[11:52:19] <Respek> 'd be appending a space, but maybe that's the ticket!
[11:52:30] <randomguy1> oh, prepend
[11:52:45] <randomguy1> swap order of +' '
[11:52:55] <Respek> and I think it'd be attr, not prop no?
[11:53:08] <randomguy1> see if prop works, if so, prefer prop
[11:58:18] <Respek> no dice
[11:58:36] <Respek> I guess another way to ask is, how does one save the placeholder to a variable
[11:58:36] <randomguy1> prop and attr don't work?
[12:00:47] <randomguy1> um, one thing, on your fiddle, your selecting textareas and password fields, but not text fields, which is what your html in that fiddle has
[12:03:09] <randomguy1> also your ' ' += placeholder, += isn't valid there.  just +
[12:04:17] <Respek> sorry, I updated it, here's the latest: http://jsfiddle.net/respek/d1e9j8dn/7/
[12:11:39] <randomguy1> Respek: http://jsfiddle.net/d1e9j8dn/9/
[12:11:52] <randomguy1> man fiddle is being slow for me for some reason
[12:11:58] <randomguy1> one of the cdn links is snailing
[12:12:08] <Respek> randomguy1 I was just updating too, maybe that's why http://jsfiddle.net/respek/d1e9j8dn/10/
[12:15:28] <Respek> randomguy1 not sure why it adds another line break though...
[12:15:42] <randomguy1> which one? 9 or 10?
[12:15:48] <Jqueer> Hi guys, was wondering if you guys could help me with the bxSlider library. I'm quite a newbie but i need to have a clickable li, with the same amount of li's as there are images. These images are added through a CMS. could anyone help?
[12:16:38] <Respek> randomguy1 nvmd
[12:16:41] <Respek> thanks for the help!
[12:16:47] <randomguy1> sure
[12:20:08] <Jqueer> anyone?
[12:21:33] <HoNgOuRu> randomguy1, hi
[12:21:34] <HoNgOuRu> again
[12:21:40] <HoNgOuRu> I got another question
[12:21:40] <randomguy1> yo
[12:22:08] <HoNgOuRu> Im clicking the td, and getting the cell, emptying it, and append an input type=text
[12:22:13] <HoNgOuRu> it works...
[12:22:17] <cjwelborn> Jqueer: it helps to pastebin your code (smaller is better) to show where you're at with the problem.
[12:22:38] <HoNgOuRu> but when I click the field to edit, it reruns the td selector
[12:23:03] <HoNgOuRu> Im saving the txt previous to appending the input field and rewriting the value to it
[12:23:06] <HoNgOuRu> so I can edit it
[12:23:08] <randomguy1> HoNgOuRu: two ways
[12:23:15] <HoNgOuRu> maybe I didnt make myself clear
[12:23:26] <HoNgOuRu> Im all ears
[12:23:38] <Respek> can someone help me understand what is happening on line 8 here? http://jsfiddle.net/respek/d1e9j8dn/10/ I don't recognize the use of !$(this).val()
[12:23:47] <randomguy1> HoNgOuRu: in your click handler, you can check if your $(this).hasClass('something') to see if it has a class that is on your input field, and if so, cancel the event
[12:23:51] <NoiseEee> HoNgOuRu: query the event... did it happen on a form element / textbox?  if so, cancel
[12:24:07] <randomguy1> HoNgOuRu: or attach an event to the input of click and cancel the propagation
[12:24:36] <Jqueer> cjwelborn here is my code http://pastebin.com/gBgn2EQp
[12:24:44] <HoNgOuRu> randomguy1, didn't get last line
[12:24:49] <randomguy1> like NoiseEee said, i'd probably do it in the existing one
[12:24:52] <cjwelborn> Respek: if the value attribute is empty, then do the stuff. (!value, or 'not value').
[12:25:06] <randomguy1> does your input have any classes on them?
[12:25:34] <randomguy1> or NoiseEee  can you do $(this).is('input') ?
[12:25:38] <HoNgOuRu> NoiseEee, I click a td, with pure text.. I save that text empty the td, and append an input text field
[12:25:44] <Respek> cjwelborn oh thanks!
[12:25:51] <HoNgOuRu> randomguy1, no...
[12:26:10] <NoiseEee> HoNgOuRu: and your issue is that clicking the input fires the TD handler, correct
[12:26:26] <HoNgOuRu> I suppose, cause the new text shown is cleared
[12:26:54] <HoNgOuRu> so, adding some kind of flag would help
[12:27:01] <HoNgOuRu> and remove it afterwards
[12:27:17] <NoiseEee> HoNgOuRu: sure you can do that, or understand event bubbling.
[12:27:24] <HoNgOuRu> maybe adding an attribute to the td, like editing
[12:27:26] <HoNgOuRu> or something
[12:27:27] <randomguy1> i need to play in a fiddle, if you can do $(event.target).is('input') you could evaluate that
[12:27:46] <NoiseEee> HoNgOuRu: no, query the event in the handler and if it happened on an <input>, then cancel the event / don't do anything
[12:28:02] <HoNgOuRu> ok
[12:28:29] <HoNgOuRu> how do I ask if it happened on an input ?
[12:29:44] <randomguy1> yeah!
[12:30:00] <randomguy1> use $(event.target).is('input') and only do your logic in your handler if that is false
[12:30:06] <NoiseEee> https://api.jquery.com/event.target/ @ HoNgOuRu
[12:30:33] <randomguy1> or actually $(event.target).is('td') == true, white listing
[12:30:50] <NoiseEee> yeah but that can be tricky
[12:30:55] <NoiseEee> esp. if you click on text in the td
[12:32:14] <randomguy1> i wonder if it would be better to bind to the actual elements and do it with one()
[12:34:33] <flexpaint> https://jsfiddle.net/eLsfc6cj/ how can i make this update the inline styling when main-wrapper resizes
[12:35:05] <flexpaint> without a page refresh
[12:36:22] <tasaif> best html/css/js editor for beginning developer on MacOS?
[12:36:47] <randomguy1> flexpaint: move your variable logic inside your functions
[12:36:56] <randomguy1> that way it re-evaluates on the event
[12:37:02] <randomguy1> as it is, it gets it and is static
[12:37:15] <randomguy1> https://jsfiddle.net/eLsfc6cj/1/
[12:37:19] <cjwelborn> Jqueer: I would probably use a Document Fragment, building a <a><li> for every image on the page, and then attach the doc frag to your list. Untested: http://pastebin.com/00nwn4ar
[12:37:24] <HoNgOuRu> NoiseEee, thank you...
[12:37:30] <HoNgOuRu> now one more thing
[12:37:38] <flexpaint> randomguy1, thank you. i appreciate it
[12:37:39] <HoNgOuRu> NoiseEee, the textfield is not editable
[12:37:44] <Jqueer> document fragment? forgive my ignorance
[12:37:56] <decx> why do you use jquery to make a square box
[12:38:11] <decx> that's probably one ofthe more ridiculous things
[12:38:18] <randomguy1> Jqueer: a variable of a dom element like var x = $('<div>')
[12:38:32] <Jqueer> ahh okay
[12:38:33] <randomguy1> Jqueer: so long as it is not attached to the actual dom it is a 'fragment'
[12:42:24] <Jqueer> like this? $object.find('.inner ul li').click.each(function(index){                 console.log($index, "List!");                              })
[12:42:24] <KyleKoder> http://jsperf.com/new-audio-vs-document-createelement-audio is this var a = new Audio(); a plugin or something?
[12:42:28] <KyleKoder> I can't find a tutorial on it
[12:42:53] <randomguy1> !paste @ Jqueer
[12:43:02] <randomguy1> still broken eh?
[12:43:07] <randomguy1> !paste
[12:43:07] <b-ot> randomguy1: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:46:23] <cjwelborn> Jqueer: that would be great if the list was already built. To built it, check my link above (i meant for the id to be on the <ul> element though). After it is built dynamically you can handle the clicks however you want.
[12:46:24] <KyleKoder> is the new Audio(); part of jquery? or is it sometype of plugin?
[12:46:34] <cjwelborn> to build it*
[12:46:43] <KyleKoder> http://jsperf.com/new-audio-vs-document-createelement-audio seeing it on here
[12:46:50] <decx> it's part of html5
[12:47:19] <decx> ?mdn audio
[12:47:20] <b-ot> decx: <audio> - HTML (HyperText Markup Language) - Mozilla Developer ... → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio
[12:48:12] <tasaif> Giving Komodo Edit a shot
[12:48:26] <KyleKoder> is it only for firefox then?
[12:48:29] <Jqueer> sorry i didn't notice the previous link as it was on a new line! thanks for your help cjwelborn
[12:53:33] <Jqueer> hi again, does the lnk actually have to link somewhere?
[12:56:44] <randomguy1> Jqueer: link could go to "#" which would do nothing
[13:00:17] <randomguy1> 'nuff fun for me.  later all
[13:13:54] <kackl_000_> When I transition from a page it's flashing a non styled version (bulleted list) for a second before the transition.  Any tips?
[13:19:25] <decx> do you give it a new class on load?
[13:22:26] <kackl_000_> It's just two pages in a single html and an anchor which points to the #pagename.  It looks like it's something to do with the push panels I have, as it's their content it's showing briefly.  Maybe my position in dom
[13:22:26] <gambl0re> when you do somethingl like this... var $greeting = $('div.greet'). that means i can use the variable name instead of the selector but why do i have to put the $ in front of the variable name?
[13:22:26] <decx> you dont
[13:22:26] <notchris> gambl0re: It caches the instance of the variable
[13:22:26] <decx> people just do that to remember it's a jquery collection
[13:22:28] <gambl0re> i could just put var x = $('element') ?
[13:22:35] <decx> yes
[13:22:51] <kackl_000_> Yeah, looks like it's because the panel wasn't in the page tags.
[13:23:00] <gambl0re> i see...ok thanks
[13:23:43] <gambl0re> is it best practice to put the $ in front of the variable name?
[13:23:49] <kackl_000_> When you want to reuse a piece of code say a navigation bar, what's the best way to do this?  Currently I set it to a php variable and echo it, but wondering if there is a better way
[13:24:06] <NoiseEee> gambl0re: some people do it to keep straight what is a plain JS variable, and what is a jquery object
[13:24:24] <decx> duh repeat much
[13:24:27] <notchris> kackl_000_: This is #jquery
[13:24:53] <gambl0re> i see. its just used to distinguish between jquery objects and javascript variables. got it.
[13:25:07] <NoiseEee> repeat many much
[13:25:11] <NoiseEee> * 3
[13:25:13] <decx> i dont like the look of it
[13:25:25] <NoiseEee> me neither
[13:26:45] <kackl_000_> notchris, I know.  But wonder if it's still relevant to this channel.  Say I have a <div data-role='footer'><h3>Something here</h3></div> that I want to repeat on each page.  Wondering how this is best accomplished
[13:27:01] <decx> this is for jquery mobile?
[13:27:06] <kackl_000_> yeah
[13:27:13] <decx> bye
[13:27:18] <kackl_000_> oh
[13:27:21] <decx> hehe
[13:27:33] <decx> sorry, but that just means i'm tuning out ^^
[13:27:35] <kackl_000_> I see, this is #jquery not #jquerymobile
[13:27:40] <decx> na it's cool
[13:27:57] <decx> topic says it's fine
[13:28:10] <kackl_000_> kk
[13:29:00] <kackl_000_> I thought I felt a kick coming :)
[13:29:31] <decx> unlikely in here
[13:29:34] <decx> only spammers
[13:30:28] <notchris> kackl_000_: When you repeat content, jquery has “each” which is helpful
[13:30:45] <notchris> But if you’re trying to repeat a header on each page
[13:30:49] <notchris> I would include it as a template
[13:30:52] <notchris> Similar to how WP does
[13:31:02] <decx> no idea what jqm does
[13:31:10] <notchris> decx: jQuery mobile?
[13:31:18] <decx> that's what this is about
[13:31:25] <decx> read much?
[13:31:27] <decx> ^^
[13:31:40] <kackl_000_> I mean I don't think it's specific to jqm per say
[13:31:51] <kackl_000_> but just curious how others do this
[13:31:55] <notchris> decx: tl;dr
[13:32:15] <notchris> kackl_000_: You create a main template and then include your Header and Footer as templates within in
[13:33:30] <pauled> Hi, I am looking function to limit length on element, I found this but it doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/q6zuzqu5/1/
[13:34:01] <decx> the keyword you are looking for is truncate
[13:34:25] <pauled> I know the condition is wrong, but in the blog post, the comment are positive
[13:34:30] <pauled> thanks decx
[13:34:39] <pauled> I will google this
[13:35:03] <decx> there's also a css property
[13:35:10] <pauled> really?
[13:35:12] <decx> overflow: ellipsis or something
[13:35:17] <decx> but it finicky
[13:35:37] <notchris> pauled: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substr
[13:35:37] <notchris> ?
[13:35:45] <pauled> it will work on <a>?
[13:35:55] <decx> works on everything
[13:35:59] <pauled> thanks notchris
[13:36:09] <notchris> $(‘a.class’)
[13:36:17] <notchris> as your selector, or without a class
[13:36:25] <decx> you want to check how many chars your element can hold and then create a substr index from that
[13:36:29] <NoiseEee> pauled: dont forget to check on the length of the text in your "if" clause
[13:36:48] <NoiseEee> right now you're checking the length of a jquery object
[13:36:48] <decx> and you want to add your full text as title attribute because otherwise it would be stupid
[13:37:08] <notchris> pauled: And don’t forget to append some sort of elipsis or something
[13:37:16] <notchris> So that the user knows it was truncated
[13:37:21] <notchris> If it’s something visibile
[13:37:23] <pauled> yes
[13:46:12] <ceramicskulls> robertmaxrees - here? :l
[13:56:31] <xniz> if some data is loaded by the load method, will the loaded data use the styles I have outlined in my .css file?
[13:58:12] <decx> sure
[13:58:52] <xniz> Alright.
[14:04:10] <ceramicskulls> Why is it printing out the result twice? http://jsbin.com/fusibiziha/1/edit?html,js,console,output it spits it all out into the first UL, then in the second UL is correct?
[14:06:22] <decx> i looked at it then saw the last 8 lines js and noped out
[14:06:47] <decx>  });          });                  });      });    });  });}
[14:08:14] <xniz> well... the load method didnt work for me >.<
[14:08:49] <ceramicskulls> > _ >
[14:09:02] <xniz> I'm trying to load the #index section inside of pages.html into the #page element by loading the HTML mark up dynamically
[14:09:25] <xniz> No go.. I'm starting to wonder if my hosting is screwing things up
[14:09:35] <decx> console log your response
[14:10:20] <ceramicskulls> decx sorry, it's all under a click function, but it's happening in optly.get(resultEndpoint) lol
[14:13:51] <spottieOttie> i cannot fucking believe this slider is 1300 lines of code for jquery
[14:14:09] <spottieOttie> a simple go from a to b, with thumbnail pagination,is 1300 fuckign lines of code, how the fuck is that even possible
[14:15:04] <decx> scripts that try to appeal to a broad audience have many edgecases, options and variants. that's why a succinct script that only does what you need is something you pay someone for
[14:16:25] <spottieOttie> i mean i look through and its absurd. calculus was finger painting compared to this, how is so excessive and annoying all the if else declaration, just fucking slide the div from A TO B, holy fuckski bud
[14:16:43] <decx> well just do it yourself then duh
[14:16:52] <decx> it's not rocketscience
[14:17:08] <spottieOttie> it tries to present itself as such
[14:17:10] <ceramicskulls> decx http://jsfiddle.net/kVdZG/591/ for each object in data I want to create a ul, then within each ul I want to dump the data from parent object
[14:17:44] <spottieOttie> a slider should be 10 lines of code. 20 tops. this ridiculous
[14:18:33] <xniz> has anyone here worked with the load method ? I am trying to load dynamic page data but it seems to not want to work
[14:18:40] <ceramicskulls> now it's dumping the data into two correct ul, but the first ul still has both objects data, while the second ul has the correct data.
[14:19:04] <azi> i have a map. i want click on image specific area first click change colour red, second click change colour green, third click change colour blue. like image mapping. any one know solution? if the color transparent very good
[14:19:06] <xniz> oh crap :/
[14:19:27] <xniz> aha fixed :D
[14:20:49] <decx> ceramicskulls: you want an array of your objects, these 2 {},{} are not related
[14:21:50] <decx> there you go http://jsfiddle.net/kVdZG/592/
[14:23:16] <ceramicskulls> decx ++++++
[14:23:57] <decx> notice how we now append all the li to the ul before attaching it to the active dom
[14:29:32] <ceramicskulls> decx, yes I saw that, thanks a lot for the help
[14:30:09] <ceramicskulls> earlier today I struggled to get it appended, but that was because I forgot the . for the selector lol found that out after asking ; p
[14:31:22] <pauled> decx: I tried with css: http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/pugqtffm/
[14:31:44] <pauled> decx: the problem's it truncate everything inside the element
[14:35:14] <decx> what else is it supposed to do?
[14:37:37] <pauled> trying to truncate "<a>A CM Kingscrusher-YouTube<pan>2127</span></a>" into "<a>A CM Kingscrushe...<pan>2127</span></a>"
[14:38:01] <decx> well that just depends on the width
[14:38:19] <pauled> I don't think so
[14:39:19] <decx> also your button click has weird stuff in it again
[14:39:33] <pauled> trying with jquery doesn't work
[14:39:35] <decx> i mean how often are you gonna write this.text()
[14:39:41] <decx> ^^
[14:39:48] <pauled> ^^ don't know what is wrong with each()
[14:41:40] <pauled> i don't understand, there can be many user_link element with a length superior
[14:42:02] <decx> 'this' doesnt have the method .text()
[14:43:26] <pauled> you mean i am mixing variable text with the utilities text()?
[14:43:39] <pauled> may be that is wrong
[15:06:46] <DietDrK> I have a hack for getting the text of a <g> element in an SVG graph. EdgeText = $(this).parents().children('text')[0].textContent; . How to set EdgeText=''; when that text is not set so I don't get "Cannot read property of undefined"... ?
[15:07:16] <DietDrK> Oh, I'd check the length of $(this).parents().children('text').length() ?
[15:07:21] <decx> var edgetext = $().... || ''
[15:07:54] <decx> if the first thing is false then use the one after || basicly
[15:08:12] <DietDrK> It's not false here, it's Cannot read property of Undefined
[15:08:16] <DietDrK> uncaught TypeError
[15:08:25] <decx> well that's because tehre is no length()
[15:08:28] <decx> only length
[15:09:47] <DietDrK> I went with:    if (EdgeText = $(this).parents().children('text').length > 0) {   var EdgeText = $(this).parents().children('text')[0].textContent; } else {  EdgeText = '';  }
[15:10:11] <DietDrK> ignore the first assignment and that's what I went with
[15:10:11] <decx> no
[15:26:19] <pauled> it is possible to keep into span not truncated? http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/8k3wwzL9/
[15:30:36] <decx> just wrap your text
[15:30:40] <decx> and apply it to that
[15:30:52] <decx> otherwise you will have to deal with textnodes
[15:33:49] <pauled> I don't how I can do that
[15:34:13] <decx> you can do it
[15:36:16] <pauled> I meant I don't see how :)
[15:36:50] <decx> you'Re killing me here
[15:37:22] <decx> take it, http://jsfiddle.net/8k3wwzL9/1/
[15:38:35] <pauled> thanks a lot :)
[15:53:14] <pauled> decx: I don't understand 'this.title = this.textContent;'
[15:53:32] <decx> it's a petpeeve of mine
[15:53:43] <pauled> ah yes I see
[15:53:43] <decx> if you truncate i still want to read everything if i want to
[16:06:15] <gambl0re> what does is this line doing? "if ('#switcher').is(':hidden')"
[16:06:32] <robertmaxrees> nothing
[16:06:39] <gambl0re> whats :hidden
[16:06:44] <robertmaxrees> if ($('#switcher').is(':hidden')) {} would do something.
[16:06:48] <robertmaxrees> we told you earlier.
[16:07:13] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/hidden-selector/
[16:07:31] <gambl0re> element....but :hidden is not a element
[16:07:42] <robertmaxrees> that's a selector.
[16:07:50] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery hidden
[16:07:51] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: :hidden Selector | jQuery API Documentation → https://api.jquery.com/hidden-selector/
[16:07:55] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:09:16] <gambl0re> is() can either be an element or a property value?
[16:09:30] <decx> !g jquery is
[16:09:31] <b-ot> decx: .is() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/is/
[16:10:11] <gambl0re>  Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments.
[16:12:44] <gambl0re> if ($('#switcher').is(':hidden')) {} ..... id switcher is checking to see if there any selectors that are hidden?
[16:12:51] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:13:03] <robertmaxrees> it's checking to see if #switcher matches that selector.
[16:13:11] <robertmaxrees> in this case, :hidden
[16:13:48] <robertmaxrees> .is() checks if a jquery object matches some criteria.
[16:14:15] <robertmaxrees> it could be against another objects, against a selector, etc.
[16:15:25] <gambl0re> ok...thanks
[16:24:02] <ChrisBinge> Could anyone lend some eyes and help me figure out why this function doesn't calculate correctly the first time, but works after several firings (on resize)
[16:24:03] <ChrisBinge> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30563880/function-doesnt-fire-on-load-but-works-on-resize?noredirect=1#comment49199221_30563880
[16:25:53] <robertmaxrees> fwiw http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nz7h2858/57/
[16:29:14] <robertmaxrees> also: document ready might be at odds with css rendering?  not sure.
[16:29:20] <ChrisBinge> maybe
[16:29:48] <ChrisBinge> because on fiddle it seems to work, but if I change the dimensions of the container and run it, it doesn't resize the text until I resize the window
[16:33:32] <Lencl> when Im using jquery mobile, I put <form></form> and then it wrapps a div around it with CSS
[16:33:51] <Lencl> is there a way to specify jquery mobile not to touch certain elements?

[16:35:26] <Lencl> ah thank you
[17:02:17] <tx> Hey guys, is there any way to go to a line in a textarea via matching a string?
[17:02:32] <tx> So if "foo" was on line 7, it would move the cursor to line 7?
[17:09:09] <robertmaxrees> tx i know you can move the cursor to a specific position, not sure about a "line" though, since that's ephemeral.
[17:09:23] <tx> position works too
[17:09:37] <tx> but can I move to a position by string match
[17:10:06] <robertmaxrees> you could find the position pretty easily.
[17:10:21] <robertmaxrees> you can get the starting index of a string usually.
[17:33:26] <ignotus> who abara
[17:33:45] <abara> what?
[17:34:10] <Guest42426> sorry. I was learning IRC.
[17:34:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:35:13] <abara> better register your nickname dude .-.
[17:35:42] <Guest42426> yup. Learning how to do that. Thanks for advice!
[17:48:39] <tx> hmm
[17:48:46] <tx> I've set the cursor position in a text area
[17:48:51] <tx> but it doesn't visually go to that area
[17:48:57] <tx> it stays where it originally was
[17:49:40] <Mo0O> hi there
[17:49:49] <Katronix> Greetings all, can someone look at the code here: http://fixee.org/paste/96lv643/ is it written correctly to handle ID's that start with viewdetails such as viewdetails1, viewdetails2, etc?
[17:51:37] <Mo0O> do you know if it's possible to fire a function when an element has a given class?
[18:34:56] <blindMoe> Anyone know of a plugin that will detect when a user is trying to scroll higher than scrollTop 0?  Basically I want to be able to react when they scroll all the way to the top then try to scroll further.  I know I can use the mousewheel plugin to do it but am curious if there are others

[20:00:23] <spottieottie> you see at the top how the top 2 arrows when clicked are navigating to an entirely new page?
[20:00:38] <spottieottie> a new url,  is this being done with AJAX, the smoothness of the transition?
[21:21:51] <jedrek> wow, I got jesus spam off someone on this channel...
[21:34:33] <shoky> yuhp
[22:11:25] <nezZario> is this not correct: #profile_list option[value='280'] ?
[22:11:40] <nezZario> I'm trying to select the <option> under the <select id="profile_list"> with the value of 280
[22:21:31] <nezZario> nevermind, got it.
[22:38:34] <tash1> Talow or arc_ you guys around?
[22:43:13] <pauled> How I can unminify .js in chrome dev tools?
[22:44:15] <pauled> ah I found it
[22:52:34] <Chulbul> Im getting 422 Unprocessable Entity 	while using ajax jquery , how to get its response for tihs status code ..? success method is not workign ..  what else it there/
[22:56:51] <tash> I'm 99.9999999999% sure I've got something wrong in here. https://jsfiddle.net/1nrasxup/7/  It isn't working on my site, and I'm pretty sure it's because I'm not exactly sure how to find each instance of the classes I'm searching for to run the if condition.
[22:57:43] <tash> When the page loads, if the reference textfield or the qty textfield either have a value, but the other doesn't, want to highlight reference textfield for that <tr>
[22:59:57] <arc_> $(this).find('qty') will find nothing if you are in reference, and find the field you are in if you are in quantity
[23:00:28] <arc_> so it's either null, or equivalent to $(this)
[23:00:53] <arc_> you still want $(this).closest('tr').find('qty')
[23:02:28] <arc_> er find('.qty') sorry. it's late here
[23:03:21] <tash> arc_, thanks I shall try
[23:03:26] <tash> what time where you are at?
[23:03:58] <arc_> 2am
[23:04:37] <arc_> this is never going to work in jsfiddle though, because you don't have default values for the fields and this only runs when the page runs
[23:05:18] <arc_> i don't know how you are invoking this function on your actual site
[23:06:35] <arc_> it works for me if i add a default value to the html
[23:06:43] <arc_> https://jsfiddle.net/1nrasxup/8/
[23:09:32] <tash> arc_, yeah when I started messing with it on jsfiddle I realized that
[23:09:42] <tash> But, it is working correctly now on the actual site
[23:09:48] <arc_> okay
[23:09:49] <tash> thanks, appreciate the help ( again )
[23:09:53] <arc_> np
[23:10:05] <tash> go to bed haha, damn you are right, it is late!
[23:10:12] <arc_> i was about to :p
[23:10:13] <arc_> good night
[23:13:10] <tash> night
