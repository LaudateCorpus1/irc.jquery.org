[02:49:58] <shadowswalker> Hello, How would I remove the combobox applied to a select element ?
[02:50:48] <Cork> "the combobox"?
[02:52:48] <shadowswalker> Cork: the bootstrap combobox
[02:53:03] <Cork> => ##bootstrap
[02:54:09] <shadowswalker> Cork: sure..
[05:18:34] <littlebit> hi people, i use jquery to convert the data that is being entered in a form to json string and then execute an http post call to my asp.net project. my project receives the call and the data but for some reason the error parameter of jQuery.ajax is being triggered in the middle where I'm processing the post request.
[05:18:43] <littlebit> is there a way how to debug this?
[05:20:29] <Cork> littlebit: is the http post done with jQuery.ajax?
[05:20:39] <Cork> or is it a .net function?
[05:21:12] <Cork> cause debugging is by finding what is calling .ajax when it shouldn't
[05:21:21] <littlebit> Cork: it is jQuery.ajax
[05:21:35] <Cork> then it most likley means you call .ajax multiple times
[05:22:53] <littlebit> Cork: this is my jquery code dpaste.com/20J5KD3
[05:23:09] <littlebit> Cork: ok, is there a way how to check that?
[05:23:27] <Cork> that is just the post call, that isn't what calls it
[05:23:38] <Cork> what calls it is what you need to check
[05:30:58] <littlebit> Cork: is there a default timeout in jQuery.ajax?
[05:31:06] <Cork> no
[05:31:21] <Cork> call timeout is up to the server
[05:31:30] <littlebit> Cork: ok
[05:32:26] <Cork> unless you explicitly set one in the ajax call that is
[05:35:51] <littlebit> Cork: I have looked in the network traffic of chromium, in the networksection I see that my request is being given the status '(canceled)' of type xhr. Initiated byajax.send
[05:35:59] <littlebit> * by ajax.send
[05:36:45] <Cork> littlebit: i would recommend to start looking at your code instead of looking at the network end
[05:37:19] <Cork> you might end up having to debug it from there later, but it is normally easier to stat there
[05:38:11] <littlebit> Cork: ok
[05:38:14] <littlebit> Cork: thx
[15:54:55] <znf> anyone has any idea how is Facebook doing this styled "Stop!" in the console? https://i.imgur.com/Sl6p3HI.png
[15:56:27] <taplar> probably a ##javascript question
[16:08:44] <shoky> znf:  console.log('%cHey sup', 'color: #bada55; font-size: 20px');
[16:09:16] <znf> interesting, where can I read more about %c ?
[16:09:22] <taplar> woah
[16:11:28] <shoky> znf: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console#Styling_console_output    and examples here  https://hackernoon.com/styling-logs-in-browser-console-2ec0807dc91a
[16:13:51] <znf> ah, I was reading https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/log

[19:17:16] <ColdKeyboard> Is it possible to capture hotkey press when page is not focused? i.e. I have another application open?
[19:17:34] <ColdKeyboard> I'm trying to fetch data from DigiKey.com and then paste it in CAD
[19:18:10] <ColdKeyboard> Doing Alt+Tab back and forth defeats the purpose of the app
[20:34:53] <pavonia> No, for a good reason
[21:15:15] <grkblood13> is there a way to handler similar to ajaxprefilter I can use for cross origin images?
