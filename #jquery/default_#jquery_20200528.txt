[06:59:02] <banshi> hello all
[07:53:40] <banshi> who can tell me what does this code do?

[08:33:53] <mad_moses> Hi
[08:34:23] <mad_moses> Can I load with jquery or javascript an external javascript after a specifiv event (For example an user has clicked into an input field?)
[08:38:39] <Cork> mad_moses: yes you can load extra javascript after the page has loaded
[08:38:59] <Cork> you have two options: 1. create a script tag and give it the src for the extra javascript
[08:39:14] <Cork> 2. load the javascript as a string an eval the content
[08:39:48] <Cork> (the later is what $.ajaxScript() does, but i don't recommend it if you ever want to prevent inline script with csr)
[08:46:27] <Cork> banshi: it takes a jquery object and does toString() on in and sends that as json to a server and updates the page based on the response
[08:46:52] <mad_moses> Cork: you mean, I have to create the script tag programmatically?
[08:47:02] <Cork> mad_moses: yes
[08:47:11] <Cork> it isn't that hard though
[08:47:40] <Cork> $(document.head).append($('<script>', { src: url }));
[08:47:48] <mad_moses> Cork: okay, can I create my script tag in the dom like that <fakescript src="..."> and just rename the tag to make it easier?)
[08:48:03] <Cork> mad_moses: why?
[08:48:20] <mad_moses> Cork: thought it will be easier
[08:48:31] <Cork> check what i just wrote
[08:48:47] <mad_moses> Cork: yes this looks really easy.
[08:49:20] <Cork> note though that is untested code written from memory so it might have some bugs
[08:50:12] <mad_moses> Cork: I want to load an image slider at the end of my website dynamicaly with your idea. I just want to load it if the user is scrolling down until a specific area of the website. Do you also know how to solve this?
[08:50:45] <Cork> mad_moses: just load the scripts you need but don't initialize it until you need it
[08:50:59] <Cork> it isn't worth it to fetch a remote script later
[08:51:17] <Cork> unless you use a really badly written; i guess you mean slideshow
[08:51:31] <mad_moses> Cork: okay and how can I initialize it until I need it?
[08:51:53] <Cork> you would have to check the scroll event and check when it gets close to the scrollHeight
[08:52:50] <mad_moses> Cork: okay thank you, I will try to find some examples
[08:52:55] <Cork> if it is the full page you want to check (document.documentElement.scrollHeight - self.scrollTop() - document.documentElement.clientHeight <= trigger)
[08:53:23] <Cork> if it is scrolling a sub element you want to check elm.scrollHeight and elm.clientHeight instead
[08:53:24] <banshi> Cork: Did you notice '<==== HERE' in source code? I'm getting that alert. And it looks like: 'error' \r\n 'undefined'
[08:53:39] <banshi> Cork: why can I get that error?
[08:54:08] <Cork> banshi: i suspect it is cause jquery fails to serialize the jquery object
[08:54:23] <Cork> cause you can't give a dom element to ajax and expect it to know what to do
[08:55:05] <Cork> or a jquery selection of dom elements as it is in this case
[09:05:47] <banshi> Cork: hmm, it's weird
[09:06:12] <Cork> what is?
[09:13:13] <banshi> Because it is code of default checkout.tpl from https://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=cms/download/download&download_id=47
[09:14:09] <Cork> banshi: well then you have to check for something like a transport extension or similar thay have for converting jquery objects to *something*
[09:14:15] <Cork> either json or param
[09:14:23] <Cork> cause by default what you do there doesn't work
[09:14:26] <banshi> opencart 2.3.0.2   FILE: /upload/catalog/view/theme/default/template/checkout/
[10:21:08] <Hoppelhase> What CSS attribute do you have to set for an element such that .fadeIn() undoes it? display: none works for normal text, but for <li> elements the label is not faded in
[10:24:09] <banshi> Hoppelhase: transparency?
[10:24:49] <Hoppelhase> I tried with opacity: 0 too, but that doesn't fade in the elements at all
[10:27:23] <Hoppelhase> MWE https://jsbin.com/xiguxinuxa/edit?html,css,js,output
[13:36:49] <Cork> Hoppelhase: haven't checked how 3.x does it but at leats 1.x used to require .hide() to be called as it sat an internal value used by the different slideDown, fadeIn, show(<time>) methods
[13:37:12] <Cork> but i suspect it is still the requirements
[13:40:51] <Hoppelhase> What would be the recommended solution then, such that the elements are hidden when the documents load?
[13:41:17] <Cork> use $(function() { $('').hide(); })
[13:41:30] <Cork> it will hide the element before first render
[13:42:25] <Cork> the reason for the internal value is that the elements is hidden with display: none, and then the original display value is lost so the show methods can't set the correct display value
[13:42:48] <Hoppelhase> Wouldn't that still show them as long as the document loads?
[13:43:21] <Cork> depends on how long it takes for the orignal html (not external resources) to load
[13:43:36] <Cork> yes if you have a several k long table for example it won't work
[13:44:55] <Cork> but browsers has a DOMContentLoaded event and it is fired when the body is generated and before the page gets rendered
[13:45:14] <Cork> that is among other things what $(func) uses
[13:45:23] <Cork> so it will update the dom before it gets rendred
[13:45:59] <Cork> (unless the load max time hits and the browser renders even if the end of body haven't been found in the stream)
[13:46:12] <Cork> but, ya that rarely happens
[13:48:10] <Hoppelhase> This is what I have now: https://jsbin.com/xiguxinuxa/edit?html,css,js,output
[13:48:28] <Hoppelhase> It basically does what I want, though it seems like a reimplementation of .fadeIn()
[13:49:58] <Cork> also note that it will break if the page loses focus, ex by the user switching tab
[13:50:30] <Cork> actually sorry no delay uses animation frame too so that actually works as it should
[13:50:44] <Cork> if you had used setTimeout instead you would have had the problem
[13:51:12] <Hoppelhase> What would happen in this case?
[13:55:00] <Cork> https://jsbin.com/xiguxinuxa/3/edit?html,css,js,output
[13:55:19] <Cork> bah it didn't save...
[13:55:35] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/d2v6yp8b/
[13:57:19] <Cork> and just to show you don't get any flicker https://jsfiddle.net/d2v6yp8b/1/
[13:59:05] <Cork> Hoppelhase: another advantage with this solution instead of display: none, is that the page isn't broken for ppl who visit with javascript disabled
[13:59:25] <Cork> they would just not have the animation
[14:00:57] <Hoppelhase> Okay, thanks
[14:01:49] <Hoppelhase> And what would have been the problem with using setTimeout?
[14:02:21] <Cork> jquery uses animation frame to make animations smother
[14:02:34] <Cork> its an event the browser fires when it is about to render an update to the page
[14:03:07] <Cork> if one stagers animations with setTimeout that isn't delayed by animation frame
[14:03:28] <Cork> and say the tab is out of focus for a minute all the animations will fire at the same time
[14:03:47] <Cork> as all setTimeout would have ticked of, but none of the delayed animation frames
[14:04:05] <Cork> so the staggering would be gone
[14:04:56] <Cork> this caused a ton of problems for alot of slideshow plugins for jquery as they expected animations to happen every 10ms no matter what
[14:05:35] <Cork> and as browsers change setTiemout min value to 100ms when a tab is in a background and no animation frame... ya, they brake badly
[14:05:56] <Cork> forced jquery to back out animation frame support for several versions
[14:10:38] <Hoppelhase> I see
[14:10:58] <Hoppelhase> Cork: Btw, are you a jQuery dev?
[14:11:28] <Cork> no, been using it since just after 1.0 though :)
[14:12:20] <Hoppelhase> Okay :)
[14:12:42] <Cork> has read through the source code several times and followed some of the bugs in there bugtracker
[14:14:05] <Hoppelhase> Yeah, I've seen you answering based on source code knowledge several times, that's why I thought
[14:15:15] <Cork> i've had a policy that i don't adopt a lib into a page unless i feel confortable taking over maintanence of it if the current maintainer dropped it
[14:15:39] <Cork> so i always read through the lib before deciding if it is ok to use
[14:16:01] <Cork> something that graphically looks very nice can be a nightmare inside
[14:17:07] <Cork> beautytip.js is a good example of that... it was where i learned to inspect the code before accepting a lib
[14:17:16] * Cork shudders
[14:17:46] <Cork> http://dillon-sellars.github.io/BeautyTips/
[14:17:53] <Cork> the code is utterly horrible
[14:18:39] <Cork> and i my fool started using it, and when the maintainer dropped it i had to update it to keep the page working
[14:22:00] <Hoppelhase> Hhm, I see a lot of calculations there, but at least they seem structured into several smaller functions  https://github.com/dillon-sellars/BeautyTips/blob/master/jquery.bt.js
[14:23:11] * Hoppelhase needs some coffee
[14:24:03] <Cork> its the spagetti code that btOn that is the problem
[14:24:31] <Cork> the entire plugin is basically in one gigantic "show" function
[14:26:09] <Cork> btOn is something like 900 lines or so if i remember correctly
[14:27:31] <Cork> but ya, haven't read it in like 6 years so it is getting a bit hazy
[16:36:00] <amalgameate> hi, does anyone know if it's possible to bring up the mobile keyboard when you focus an input via jquery?  when i do $("#ele").focus(), the field gets outlined in blue for ioS but the keyboard remains hidden until the user manually focuses the input.
[17:30:22] <Plazma> so is jQuery still useful if you're using a complete front end framework like Vue?
[22:17:23] <phelix> I am trying to track down an error in chrome console " Uncaught SystemError: Unexpected token '.' " but to the right of this when trying to track down where this is actually coming from it says :formatted:1 and this is it. I assumed that would mean its in the <head> of the html. But clicking on this it takes me to the source page and it's all empty. Trying to figure out how to track down what might be causing this error.
[22:29:46] <Hoppelhase> phelix: For what file?
[22:30:29] <phelix> Hoppelhase: It doesn't show. Just simply says :formatted:1
[22:30:58] <Hoppelhase> Well, something must be triggering it? Or does it also show up when you open the console?
[22:32:32] <phelix> It is showing in the console, this error message.
[22:33:43] <Hoppelhase> Always?
[22:34:00] <Hoppelhase> You start chrome, open the console and it's there?
[22:35:03] <phelix> yes exactly
[22:35:10] <phelix> well at this webpage.
[22:35:18] <Hoppelhase> ...
[22:35:49] <phelix> https://alcoholscreeningarizona.com
[22:36:11] <Hoppelhase> Is this question related to jQuery in any way? If not, you should probably ask in a better suited channel
[22:36:29] <Hoppelhase> I'm off. Good luck!
