[00:53:35] <_3by8> Trying to figure out why this code doesn't execute: https://gist.github.com/threebyeight/ee919704291dc7121418168a9048455f for reference, the site is here: http://73.203.24.128:3000/
[02:44:01] <_3by8> I have a script set up to trigger on click and check if a Bootstrap modal event happens but I am having this issue where the code triggers even if I haven't clicked on the button that is supposed to trigger the event. All it's doing is checking if the modal is closed which is the other part of the trigger so it's like the button is staying clicked. Is there a way to clear the button click after I do it?
[02:44:07] <_3by8> Or maybe after the event fires?
[03:11:48] <_3by8> Can someone help me figure out why a particular jQuery event won't turn off?

[04:48:56] <dariolap> Hi all, how i can check if src of image ends with "img.png" ?
[04:50:16] <AdamPDotty> img.src.substr(-7) == "img.png"
[04:50:44] <dariolap> Thanks AdamPDotty
[06:10:34] <nknaresh> hi match [1] in jquery replace what should i add . i am doing as $(textpool).replace(/[1]/g,'[2]');  but it is replacing only [1] it is replacing 1 form whole html
[06:26:52] <jakob_> jquery mobile question: Using a panel widget, the ui-panel-dismiss element overlaps with the panel and grays out the whole screen. I was expecting it to only gray out the content. Any apparent reason why this would happen?
[06:53:38] <ccmonster> I'm setting up this component incorrectly, any help appreciated - https://gist.github.com/anonymous/03145a62bdf85b6aef6642f3108a3c1f
[07:24:09] <maasha> I have two sortable lists that are connected. When dragging from one list to the other list, what attributes determines the insertion place?
[07:25:18] <maasha> item.index() or placeholder.index()?
[07:26:46] <maasha> hm, both have identical values even if I drop before or after the one item in the list.
[08:04:19] <harry1> trying to add an int to a vaaible: +endTime.getSeconds()+endIn+3600
[08:04:27] <harry1> it concatenates though
[08:04:41] <harry1> how do i force it to accept the figure as an int
[08:07:04] <Uhkis> parseInt()
[08:07:53] * Woet parses Uhkis 
[08:11:27] <harry1> Uhkis: i did aleady try that but i think it gave the same output, let me try gain
[08:12:59] <harry1> confirmed - it still treats it as a string
[08:13:47] <Uhkis> then all your variables are not parseInted yet
[08:31:51] <maasha> hm, this syntax is bad   $(event.target + ' li:eq(1)') - what to write?
[08:48:38] <AdamPDotty> We have to guess there: $(event.target).find('li').eq(1)
[09:12:19] <htmlend> I've been struggling with figuring this out for days. If any one can show me how to get the description to display in the lightbox when the image is clicked that would be love https://jsfiddle.net/g1n2nnr6/11/
[09:33:31] <vladb> hello. Is jQuery.proxy available in nodejs? I'm getting "jQuery.proxy is not a function"
[09:49:31] <shoky_> vladb: are you actually running it in node? or in a browser via browserify/webpack ?
[09:52:44] <shoky_> vladb: if in a browser, then it should be available.. if you're in node.. you probably should be using cheerio instead of jquery
[09:53:08] <shoky_> and you can just use javascript's .bind instead of $.proxy anyway
[09:53:28] <shoky_> both in browser and in node
[09:55:21] <vladb> shoky_: I'm using it in node. Had some issues with .bind that led me to $.proxy
[10:11:25] <shoky_> better to fix those issues, then
[10:25:46] <taplar_busy> htmlend: i had shared this late friday https://jsfiddle.net/g1n2nnr6/13/
[10:30:26] <htmlend> taplar_busy: I am sorry, I had to go out and was not back till around 6:30pm EST on friday. I tried search to see if anyone mentioned my name in the chat but didnt see any mentions. I appreciate that!
[10:31:04] <htmlend> taplar_busy: The plugin author made an update to fix it as well https://github.com/coldfumonkeh/gallerificPlus/issues/1#issuecomment-223970894 Definetly going to study your solution and his :)
[10:41:31] <flashl> is it possible to combine tab widget with accordian widget?
[10:43:15] <decx> yeah
[10:43:24] <decx> you get a taco-rdian which is delicious
[10:53:06] <ExoUNX> greetings
[10:53:12] <ExoUNX> so I was in here before
[10:53:34] <AdamPDotty> and ate a taco-rdian?
[10:53:40] <ExoUNX> could someone provide a onclick() vs on() example so I can compare?
[10:53:53] <AdamPDotty> Sure, you could.
[10:53:59] <ExoUNX> was in here before asking questions about on() *

[11:53:10] <adavia> Is it possible to remove each previewed file using a multiple input file?
[11:53:31] <adavia> Or maybe i have to reset the whole input?
[11:57:48] <linad3rr> hi im having a problem combining those two functions, they both work but separate, could take a look at it please http://pastebin.com/2bipJmtV
[12:04:20] <linad3rr> anyone know whats the best way to do this?
[12:05:17] <decx> not like this
[12:05:49] <decx> so you want to animate scroll to hash and also collapse?
[12:05:59] <linad3rr> yes
[12:06:06] <linad3rr> because of the phone version..
[12:06:21] <linad3rr> when i separate those two functions everything works on desktop
[12:06:31] <decx> only use line 20
[12:06:33] <linad3rr> but on phone it does not since it has the menu button
[12:06:38] <decx> 17-22 is useless
[12:06:54] <linad3rr> oh ok let me try
[12:11:16] <linad3rr> decx but the problem is that on the nav bar does not close when clicking on the link
[12:11:39] <linad3rr> it does scroll down to specific part of the page from the anchor tag
[12:12:01] <linad3rr> but the menu should hide
[12:12:34] <decx> reproduce and fiddle
[12:13:35] <linad3rr> ok give me few minutes, thanks for helping me
[12:21:16] <taplar_busy> kinda slow for a monday
[12:32:10] <linad3rr> decx this is something that im using, for some reason it wont make the button open the menu but its probably the fork website, i have the html there and everything that im using http://paste.asmcbain.net/b80507d9/edit#html
[12:32:46] <linad3rr> tried to use jsfdiddle but it wont allow to paste me anything there
[12:44:48] <linad3rr> decx what do you think about this ?
[12:46:48] <taplar_busy> does 'this.hash' include the '#' in it?
[12:47:24] <linad3rr> taplar_busy yes
[12:47:52] <linad3rr> the href with just # is the back to home (top of the page)
[12:51:55] <linad3rr> those are two functions that im using one for smooth scroll and one for closing the menu button(mobile) http://pastebin.com/0453r330
[12:52:17] <vacho> hello everyone
[12:52:32] <linad3rr> i think if its possible to to make it so it scrolls down and then the nav menu will close
[12:52:48] <taplar_busy> so is it scrolling now, but not closing?
[12:52:53] <linad3rr> yes
[12:53:02] <taplar_busy> your returning false at the end of that first handler
[12:53:09] <vacho> I am facing following problem. When submitting checkboxes names[] where nothing is checked...the variable is not included in my post request. I am hoping there is a way to at least post an empty variable name='' so I can know nothing has been checked.
[12:53:13] <taplar_busy> that kills the event from propagating
[12:53:28] <linad3rr> hmm so what should i do taplar_busy
[12:54:08] <linad3rr> maybe its possible to hide it with css or something
[12:54:08] <taplar_busy> are there any links that would go through the second handler and not the first?
[12:54:37] <linad3rr> yes there is more links
[12:54:42] <linad3rr> let me give you the html
[12:55:00] <taplar_busy> vacho: that's a browser thing.  no value means none checked
[12:55:29] <vacho> taplar_busy: yes it sure is..I am hoping I can "correct" this behavior with jQuery. I need to know that nothing has been checked
[12:55:40] <taplar_busy> but you do...
[12:55:42] <taplar_busy> lol
[12:56:04] <taplar_busy> there is never a case where a value was not checked and it's sent to the server, in regards to checkboxes
[12:56:13] <vacho> taplar_busy: I do..if I check for the variable in my script. I am looking for a more dynamic solution where I don't need to check.
[12:56:16] <taplar_busy> you just check if it is on the request or not on the backend
[12:56:45] <taplar_busy> anything you do on the front end is going to take more work than a simple existance check
[12:57:04] <vacho> taplar_busy: Yes.. but instead of checking for 9 different checkboxes, I rather solve it where it sends me an empty request, and I can then update my DB with an empty value
[12:57:22] <linad3rr> taplar_busy maybe this will help a little bit with the html http://pastebin.com/5YucbLrF
[12:57:53] <linad3rr> vacho you should check it on the server side always
[12:58:13] <taplar_busy> linad3rr: personally i'd keep both bindings, and just add the close logic to your first one as well
[12:58:29] <taplar_busy> call the same method from both places to close
[12:59:03] <linad3rr> could you help me with this ?
[12:59:38] <taplar_busy> first try extracting our your inline method to your second binding and give it a name
[12:59:52] <taplar_busy> and use that method name in your second binding
[13:00:04] <taplar_busy> $('nav').on('click', 'a', theFunction);
[13:00:13] <vacho> taplar_busy: my solution is sound, I just need this implemented.
[13:00:35] <vacho> linad3rr: I am checking for it
[13:00:56] <linad3rr> taplar_busy one moment
[13:03:37] <linad3rr> taplar_busy im actually confused
[13:03:43] <taplar_busy> sup?
[13:04:03] <linad3rr> do i keep those two functions the way the are and create a 3rd one ?
[13:04:28] <taplar_busy> nope, your extracting the method used in the second one into a named function
[13:04:46] <taplar_busy> copy it, paste it else where, name it, and then use that name where it's definition currently is
[13:05:03] <taplar_busy> we're just doing this so it's reusable
[13:05:09] <linad3rr> ok one moment
[13:07:48] <linad3rr> taplar_busy something like that http://pastebin.com/nWMijedU
[13:07:52] <linad3rr> ?
[13:08:38] <taplar_busy> yeah, but you took out the function entirely.  there isn't a name function 'hiddingFunction'
[13:10:10] <linad3rr> taplar_busy so i should basically leave the "theFunction" where it was before instead of naming it on my own
[13:10:35] <taplar_busy> https://jsfiddle.net/ejxh4uuw/
[13:10:51] <taplar_busy> btw you have/had two doc readies around your second binding
[13:11:08] <taplar_busy> $(document).ready() and $(function(){}) are both doc readies
[13:11:17] <taplar_busy> only need one, provided your logic is above your body
[13:12:00] <linad3rr> oh, let me try this, i did not understand it, like i see what you mean now
[13:16:38] <linad3rr> taplar_busy its very close
[13:16:49] <linad3rr> like it almost works
[13:17:05] <taplar_busy> so i assume it still works on the links that do not go through the first binding?
[13:17:17] <linad3rr> it works when clicked on home
[13:17:23] <linad3rr> it will close the navbar
[13:17:30] <linad3rr> but on those other 3 links
[13:17:34] <linad3rr> it wont close
[13:17:42] <taplar_busy> alright, so now in your first binding, call that method right before the return false
[13:18:50] <linad3rr> one moment
[13:21:53] <Ty_> Hey what
[13:22:00] <Ty_> what's goin' on guys? *
[13:23:06] <linad3rr> taplar_busy http://pastebin.com/rErWuWYc
[13:23:21] <linad3rr> it did insert it on line 14 take a look
[13:23:24] <linad3rr> but nothing
[13:23:26] <linad3rr> same thing
[13:23:38] <linad3rr> it works for home link but not the rest
[13:23:41] <taplar_busy> no, not binding.  call it
[13:23:51] <Ty_> Currently trying to get a lightbox working with dynamic content and can't seem to figure out what is going wrong. When you click the image it opens it, but it doesn't allow you to close by clicking again: http://codepen.io/TyStelmach/pen/NrPzZg?editors=0010
[13:24:53] <taplar_busy> uncomment it down below, leave that how it was, and just directly call that method in the first binding
[13:26:02] <trick2g> how can i access functions inside a (function($){ outside of it?
[13:26:13] <linad3rr> one moment
[13:27:34] <Ty_> trick2g take a look at this link, I think this is what you're after: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3402877/calling-a-function-defined-inside-jquery-ready-from-outside-of-it
[13:27:35] <taplar_busy> trick2g: if you declare them inside that closure they are scoped to it.  you would have to assign them to a variable outside of that scope to access them outside that function
[13:30:37] <trick2g> how is (function($) different than $(document).ready(function () ?
[13:30:48] <trick2g> https://jsfiddle.net/pxdyt58k/
[13:31:00] <trick2g> this is the render function i want to access in another part of my code
[13:31:01] <linad3rr> taplar_busy can you look at this http://pastebin.com/pmcmyTPc it works, but for some reason when i click home it will close but not scroll to the top
[13:31:10] <linad3rr> so now it works for 3 links..
[13:31:11] <linad3rr> :)
[13:31:39] <Antraxis> im looking for client side javascript library to send proper oAuth request and which is not 70kB size
[13:31:48] <taplar_busy> trick2g: (function($){}(jQuery)); is just an IIFE that takes jQuery as an argument so you can use $ inside there without conflict
[13:32:09] <taplar_busy> document ready is a method to delay execution until the DOM is loaded.
[13:32:17] <taplar_busy> IIFEs do not wait
[13:32:26] <taplar_busy> as per the first "I" :)
[13:33:04] <taplar_busy> linad3rr: home shouldn't scroll.  due to your ':not([href=#]' condition
[13:33:46] <linad3rr> taplar_busy yeah it jumps right to the top
[13:33:53] <linad3rr> but with mobile
[13:34:04] <linad3rr> version it wont now
[13:34:08] <trick2g> taplar_busy: ok, so can i access the renderer function outside of (function($)?
[13:34:09] <linad3rr> anyway to fix this
[13:34:24] <taplar_busy> trick2g: which function?
[13:34:26] <Ty_> What is causing my image in my lightbox to open (in seemingly a new window) as opposed to the overlay? http://pastebin.com/67iiPMBt  |  http://codepen.io/TyStelmach/pen/NrPzZg?editors=0010
[13:34:36] <trick2g> taplar_busy: i linked the code.
[13:34:41] <jose3_> hey guys, can someone help me with a jquery ajax callback
[13:35:03] <taplar_busy> linad3rr: you'll have to mess around with it.  i can't help to much today.  i can only browse a little, :)
[13:35:17] <jose3_> I have an ajax call to run a php script, in the success action I want to assign a variable
[13:35:45] <linad3rr1> taplar_busy i will be back
[13:35:47] <jose3_> I know I need to do a call back or make async false, but I can't gigure out how I can get my callback to give me a variable
[13:35:56] <linad3rr1> if the battery dies
[13:36:07] <linad3rr1> so if it dc me it means my battery dies
[13:36:19] <jose3_> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f467959bde924ead89f72ffa7adf0729
[13:36:25] <Antraxis> jose3_: you want to get variable from ajax call?
[13:36:34] <jose3_> yes sit
[13:36:46] <Antraxis> i liek this line:
[13:36:47] <Antraxis> result = result;
[13:36:51] <jose3_> hha
[13:36:55] <taplar_busy> jose3_: your callback will not give 'back' a variable.  it has no where to go back to.  your callback will need to call a method to do whatever it needs to do with the variable
[13:36:59] <jose3_> thats me just figuring out whats going on
[13:37:09] <Antraxis> omg
[13:37:15] <Antraxis> you just discovered javascript
[13:37:23] <Ty_> lol
[13:38:37] <taplar_busy> jose3_: http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[13:39:26] <trick2g> taplar_busy: https://jsfiddle.net/pxdyt58k/ so, anyway to access this function outside of it?
[13:39:35] <trick2g> any way^
[13:39:39] <taplar_busy> trick2g: i'm not sure what your asking
[13:40:09] <trick2g> i'm trying to run the renderer function outside of (function($){
[13:40:22] <taplar_busy> oh, no
[13:40:27] <taplar_busy> it's scoped to that function as it is
[13:41:05] <taplar_busy> also that IIFE doesn't make sense.  window !== jQuery
[13:41:45] <taplar_busy> if your wanting to use window like jQuery and there are other developers on your team, your going to confuse the h* out of them
[13:44:15] <Ty_> taplar_busy: when you get a sec could you help me figure out how I could link a dynamic image to a lightbox?
[13:44:53] <taplar_busy> Ty_: i can't help much today.  got a lot of stuff going on at the office.  lunch break for now, ;)
[13:45:16] <taplar_busy> there are others though that can possibly help
[13:46:18] <Ty_> dang, alright man have a good lunch :p
[13:58:59] <Ty_> I'm trying to make a lightbox with dynamic content and keep getting a "Resource interpreted as Document but transferred with MIME type image/jpeg: " error when setting the a href to the same link as the image's src
[13:59:09] <Ty_> any ideas on how to get around this?
[14:01:13] <trick2g> is there any possible way to reload a canvas from jquery
[14:01:18] <trick2g> without redrawing it
[14:13:57] <decx> that doesnt make sense
[14:42:52] <jquery627> HELLO?
[14:44:34] <AwkwardCough> Hello
[14:45:39] <jquery627> ive tried looking online for a solution to this ajax thing and still cannot find a solution
[14:46:46] <jquery627> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7d6c6e154f188905325aa66081cd52ac
[14:47:38] <jquery627> On success I call the show_result function. That functions contents fire off fine. But, how come I can't just assign it to a variable for later use?
[14:48:01] <jquery627> moreover, how do i store it for later use
[14:49:51] <rogger_h> hey guys whats the diffrence between postman post and jquery ajax post like that type: 'POST', data: {           data    : JSON.stringify(object)   }
[14:50:08] <rogger_h> when i post using postman extension the server is not getting the data but from the ajax it is
[14:50:41] <AwkwardCough> jquery627: have you tried just setting it to a variable you create outside the ajax scope?
[14:52:05] <jquery627> yes- but i believe that I am having an asynchronous response problem?
[14:52:33] <jquery627> but yes- at the top of the file (that isnt in that gist) i have var result=null
[15:03:41] <jquery627> ok
[15:03:53] <jquery627> Well i came up with a shitty solution that works well enough for me
[15:05:17] <ales> hello, best site for jquery learning?
[15:06:05] <jquery627> https://www.codeschool.com/ has a nice jquery tutorial
[15:09:25] <AwkwardCough> it is more for questions you need help with
[15:09:50] <AwkwardCough> jquery627: what did you end up doing?
[15:10:04] <jquery627> well I lied
[15:10:11] <jquery627> Im confused as to what is going on
[15:11:25] <AwkwardCough> are you getting errors in console?
[15:12:16] <jquery627> Well... I did what you said to do?? and put it in the success action
[15:12:16] <ales> thanks jquery627
[15:12:24] <jquery627> But I feel like that shouldn't work
[15:13:03] <jquery627> because A) it didn't before and B) everyything on google says you need a particular setup unless you tell the ajax async=false
[15:13:18] <jquery627> ales: no problem
[15:14:00] <jquery627> OK nm it doesn't work now
[15:14:29] <AwkwardCough> so you are creating the var outside of the ajax call and setting it in the success call?
[15:14:32] <jquery627> so here was my hack from earlier. instead of just defining a global empty var i defined: var ajaxResult=[];
[15:14:50] <jquery627> then on sucess I did: ajaxResult.push(result);
[15:16:00] <jquery627> BUT- the problem with doing this is that my array is a giant PHP print_r array
[15:16:07] <jquery627> as a string though
[15:16:32] <jquery627> ["Array (     [0] => Array         (             [Contact.LastName] => BOB             [Contact.FirstName] => Michael             [ContactId] => 2946         ) .........."
[15:16:47] <jquery627> its not a real array, but a string that looks like an array
[15:17:40] <geri> hi, how can i call a function when my jquery dialog resizes?
[15:18:28] <AwkwardCough> jquery627: so you do not want the entire document but just parts of it?
[15:19:35] <AwkwardCough> geri: http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#event-resize
[15:20:40] <jquery627> AwkwardCough: I am not quite sure what you mean? Yes, I do want all the data that comes back from findattendees.php
[15:24:18] <AwkwardCough> sorry i guess I am also confused you want all the data but its just really large amount of it?
[15:27:36] <geri> AwkwardCough: dialogresize also works
[15:28:38] <shoky_> jquery627: you can store it in a variable for later use, but you gotta make sure that the use is really later and not before the ajax is even succesful, i.e. a timing issue.  promises might make this nicer e.g.  var request = $.ajax(...);  then anywhere you want:  request.done(function(result) { ... })
[15:29:31] <jquery627> yes my data is kind of large but it depends. In this instance i have 600+ entries w/ an fname lname and ID
[15:29:43] <shoky_> jquery627 and btw you should return a json response, not a weird php syntax
[15:30:13] <jquery627> shoky_: Do you know of any good documentation for promises?
[15:31:14] <shoky_> jquery627: jquery docs, learn.jquery.com, and i like this oldie but goodie https://web.archive.org/web/20150210131509/http://www.erichynds.com/blog/using-deferreds-in-jquery
[15:31:38] <jquery627> alright then- down the rabbit hole we go
[15:31:42] <jquery627> thanks
[15:32:43] <jquery627> hahaha that link is from the waybackmachine- Nice
[15:33:47] <shoky_> yeah it wasn't working back when i saved it i guess, seems ok now tho http://www.erichynds.com/blog/using-deferreds-in-jquery
[15:38:04] <jquery627> so... I essentially call this whenever I want ?
[15:38:07] <jquery627> ```$.when( doAjax(), doMoreAjax() )   .done(function() {     console.log( 'I fire once BOTH ajax requests have completed!' );   })```
[15:39:16] <shoky_> that'd work
[15:40:22] <shoky_> i mean, doesn't seem related to your issue, but it's useful anyways
[15:46:04] <jquery627> OKAY
[15:46:07] <jquery627> I am very close I think
[15:47:09] <jquery627> But- this is firing on page load: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4dc3de1b3075177aa9c2145e994e9caa
[16:03:44] <Antraxis> what you guys would say if..
[16:04:08] <Antraxis> i write special tags for web browser for making wordpress themes with special tags through REST api
[16:04:36] <Antraxis> like <wp-api>I am: <b>{ user.name }</b></wp-api>
[16:11:16] <Neobenedict_> anyone know a *lightweight* way to replicate https://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[16:11:40] <Neobenedict_> ie. does not involve including the entire jqueryui library
[16:12:31] <Antraxis> Neobenedict_: ...
[16:12:46] <Neobenedict_> ...?
[16:12:47] <Antraxis> Neobenedict_: pure draggable plugin + code "close" button on your own?
[16:13:17] <Neobenedict_> well yeah that would work but if anyone knew a library for these sort of things
[16:13:33] <diamonds> is it just me or does search not work at all? http://api.jquery.com/?s=remove
[16:13:41] <diamonds> I just get basically everything as result
[16:13:53] <Antraxis> Neobenedict_: this are windows i coded on my own: http://prettyminimal.com/projects/os-desk/window0.2/
[16:14:38] <decx> you'll find that all these have the word remove in their body diamonds
[16:14:50] <diamonds> :/
[16:14:58] <diamonds> jquerrrryyyyyyy
[16:15:04] <diamonds> is the website on github?
[16:15:39] <diamonds> cuz that sugs. if there's a 100% match on a fn name it should yield that as first result
[16:15:48] <diamonds> anyway :)
[16:16:28] <decx> well the docs are just wordpress
[16:16:34] <decx> just a filter for search would suffice
[16:29:48] <bango2> im trying to use focus() on the first input in a bootstrap modal. focus runs fine, the selector is right, but focus doesnt actually happen
[16:30:54] <Ty_> Why is it that when I try to dynamically load an animated gif, it breaks the URL?

[17:52:12] <compact> you sir, are a champion
[17:52:16] <compact> thanks heaps
[18:44:44] <SimonT> got a possibly weird issue.. I'm looking at some code that is calling $("form").serialize() on a timer to reload a graph. The weird thing is that if a select (dropdown) is open and an item you're hovering over an item, the hoverover item is now "selected" even though it hasn't been clicked
[18:45:13] <SimonT> not sure if that's JS or jQuery and/or if there's a way to get the only truely selected item
[18:46:44] <SimonT> quick demo.. http://jsbin.com/xuceyajugo/edit?html,output
[18:47:06] <SimonT> open the dropdown and hover over the second item
[18:48:24] <shoky_> SimonT: doesn't happen for me, in chrome
[18:49:26] <shoky_> SimonT: ya i see it happens in firefox tho
[18:50:57] <SimonT> doh.. should have tested in Chrome..
[18:51:02] <SimonT> shoky_: thanks
[18:51:22] <shoky_> pretty stupid behaviour in ff
[18:51:47] <SimonT> yeah, no kidding. kinda old bug too: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=393494
[18:52:31] <shoky_> yah
[18:53:04] <shoky_> doesn't seem like that'll get fixed.. ever ;p
[18:54:18] <SimonT> ah well, pretty minor issue in the app I'm looking at
[18:54:26] <SimonT> thanks again
[19:09:18] <johnny> hi
[19:10:36] <johnny77> hi
[19:51:19] <XwZ> hi, I have a question about function like .prepend, .append, ...
[19:52:18] <XwZ> I would like to move a div in the dom but without recreated it, I saw the .clone() function but the div contains a youtube player and I don't want to reload the video
[19:52:23] <XwZ> any idea ?
[20:28:44] <jquery006> hi, if the value of an input box ends with two "?", e.g. "test_string??", then make an ajax POST request to the server, it is read by the server as "test_stringjQuery21008741796859540045_1465258897217"
[20:29:00] <jquery006> how can I prevent this?
[20:33:52] <jquery006> prior to making the ajax request, if I console.log the value of the string, I correctly get "test_string??"
[20:34:06] <jquery006> so there's something the ajax request is doing to it
[21:15:15] <geri> hi
