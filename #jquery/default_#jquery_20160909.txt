[00:30:42] * xdevnull CPU dead
[02:50:03] <stevenm> is there anything built into jquery (e.g. something where I can just source ajax.google..) which can sort html tables?
[03:25:25] <Cork> stevenm: $('#table tbody').html(.$('tr').sort())
[03:25:41] <Cork> you most likely want to give sort a function to target a column or something like that
[04:13:04] <Xatenev> Hi
[04:13:14] <Xatenev> I gotone case whree I do $.post("someUrl?test&abc")
[04:13:25] <Xatenev> and another one where I do $.post("someOtherUrl?test&moreParams=1")
[04:13:36] <Xatenev> for the first case, the URL in the fired ajax query looks correct
[04:13:40] <Xatenev> in the 2nd, the '&' is encoded like &amp;
[04:13:47] <Xatenev> and so - the ajax request doesnt work anymore.
[04:13:55] <Xatenev> Why does it work for one and not for the other?..
[04:15:03] <Cork> Xatenev: why do you put the data in the url for posts?
[04:15:15] <Cork> just include them in the post data
[04:15:26] <Xatenev> Idk I like to mark ajax requests with a get param
[04:15:27] <Xatenev> instead of a post param
[04:15:29] <Xatenev> like ?ajax=1
[04:15:45] <Xatenev> Its still weird it works for one and not for the other...
[04:15:47] <Cork> you already have a http header for that
[04:16:37] <Cork> X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
[04:17:11] <Xatenev> hm
[04:17:12] <Xatenev> true
[04:17:20] <Cork> anyway make sure the environment you execute the js in doesn't do html escape
[04:17:23] <Xatenev> Tbh I dont use http headers too much.
[04:17:29] <Xatenev> probably very bad from me lol
[06:06:16] <codecutt_> why is this not working? $(htmlString).find('.post').data('list', 'test');
[06:08:26] <slax0r> what's not working?
[06:08:42] <codecutt_> data content is empty
[06:08:56] <slax0r> .data() does not manipulate dom
[06:09:06] <codecutt_> how do i add it?
[06:09:25] <codecutt_> i need to add the srting 'test' to the data field 'list'
[06:09:25] <slax0r> does console.log($(htmlString).fidn(".post").data("list")); print "test" in console?
[06:09:43] <codecutt_> data-list is at present empty
[06:09:50] <codecutt_> i'm trying to add it
[06:09:55] <codecutt_> value
[06:10:28] <slax0r> just add the console.log I gave you after setting it
[06:10:40] <slax0r> .data() will not change the dom, but will set the data
[06:10:45] <slax0r> so you should be able to read it
[06:11:00] <slax0r> if you want it visible in the dom, use .attr() with the combination of .data()
[06:11:27] <codecutt_> can i see an example?
[06:12:49] <codecutt_> nvm
[06:35:36] <andywww> i understand that, should i pass jquery into an iffe, i would be making it localised to that partucular functions execution environment but what benefit do i get from this?
[06:35:43] <andywww> iâ€™m struggling to understand it
[06:40:33] <codecutt_> If i do $('.foo').attr('data-boo', post.jsonArray) in node it shows up as data-boo='[object Object],[object Object]' instead of boo='[object Object]'
[06:40:56] <codecutt_> object that i am saving is a array of json object
[06:41:26] <codecutt_> how do i do this correctly?
[07:18:27] <Duikb00t> What was again that trick to select the current clicked item? http://kopy.io/eQyqI
[07:18:44] <Duikb00t> When I now execute my toggle, all content shows up
[07:18:51] <Duikb00t> I only want the one where the button is clicked
[07:28:49] <Cork> Duikb00t: trick??
[07:29:01] <Cork> the currently click element is $(this)
[07:29:10] <Duikb00t> fixedit
[07:29:19] <Duikb00t> $(this).parent().children(".address").slideToggle(500);
[07:29:54] <Cork> uh, why not just $(this).siblings()?
[07:30:00] <Cork> uh, why not just $(this).siblings('.address)?
[08:19:47] <codecutter> I'm retrieving a list of "Car" Object from Server throught ajax. Each Car has a array of "Comment" property. I'd like to paginate the Comment Array at the client side, therefore I need to save th comments for each car somewhere. I can put it somewhere in the Car Node using data attribute. When I need the list I can just find the specific car node and get all its comments.  I'm not sure if there is  a more efficient method. Any suggestions?
[08:30:45] <Cork> codecutter: that is about as efficient as it gets
[08:31:28] <codecutter> Cork: you suggest I place it in a data attribute?
[08:32:01] <codecutter> jokers over at #javascript are suggesting i use a library for this.
[08:32:17] <shoky_> .data(),  not data attribute
[08:32:30] <codecutter> are ther not the same?
[08:32:32] <codecutter> they*
[08:32:42] <decx> dataset only holds strings, data() can be everything
[08:32:51] <Cork> data attributes is a string connected to the dom node
[08:33:02] <shoky_> nope.  except that .data() reads from data-attributes once if they exist
[08:33:14] <Cork> .data stores the references in an object inside jquery
[08:33:55] <Cork> so all you need to do is carElm.data('comments', data[]...comments)
[08:34:00] <shoky_> you never want to store data in the DOM (and .data() doesn't store data in the DOM)
[08:34:03] <codecutter> here is how I am currently doing it ...<div class='foo' data-boo="key, jsonObject">
[08:34:24] <Cork> codecutter: that is for when you need to send it from server side
[08:34:35] <Cork> you don't need to do that when you create it client side
[08:34:41] <Cork> actually, you should avoid it
[08:34:43] <shoky_> var newDiv = $('<div class="foo">');  newDiv.data('boo', ...);
[08:34:52] <codecutter> I am getting the object from server
[08:35:00] <Cork> ya, but not the html
[08:35:26] <codecutter> i see
[08:36:00] <Cork> also you can do it as $('<div>', { class: 'foo', data: { comments: [] } });
[08:37:32] <codecutter> out of curiosity where does data() actually store the object?
[08:37:52] <decx> same place where everything else is parked
[08:37:53] <shoky_> in js memory
[08:38:11] <decx> $._data
[08:38:15] <shoky_> same place this is stored:  var foo = 'bar';    :P
[08:38:15] <Cork> codecutter: an internal reference inside jquery
[08:38:25] <Cork> $._data is still a function referencing it though
[08:38:49] <Cork> the object uses the jquery expando string it adds to every element
[08:38:53] <Cork> (as a key)
[08:39:09] <Cork> the rest is just a normal javascript object
[08:39:55] <decx> isnt the key the node itself
[08:40:00] <shoky_> heh, expando always makes me chuckle
[08:40:08] <shoky_> decx nope, it's a property on the node
[08:40:14] <shoky_> termed expando :S
[08:41:36] <shoky_> (the name of the property is random, something like jQuery2375897893)
[08:42:42] <Cork> decx: no
[08:42:59] <Cork> decx: you can't use a node as a key
[08:43:41] <Cork> it uses the value from elm[jQuery.expando]
[08:43:46] <Cork> (as key)
[08:44:09] <Cork> jQuery.expando is just the unique jquery key it uses to reference it self on dom elements
[08:46:44] <decx> watch me use that node as a key https://jsfiddle.net/mh0884on/ ;)
[08:49:30] <shoky_> IE11+ :P
[08:50:18] <decx> apparently the polyfill is just 2 linked arrays
[08:51:59] <codecutter> Cork: I am creating a html template for each post, I need to attach .data() each 'template', not sure if this works? http://pastebin.com/ApVnj5wD
[08:52:32] <Cork> codecutter: no
[08:52:36] <Cork> you can't do it to html
[08:52:47] <Cork> though why do you need it as html?
[08:53:05] <Cork> just attach it after the html parsing
[08:53:11] <codecutter> what do you suggest?
[08:53:12] <Cork> and just send the parsed dom forward
[08:54:10] <codecutter> that will defeat my original goal appending all posts with a single append, instead if attaching each node one by one, no?
[08:54:15] <shoky_> er, why would you need to .bind($self)  btw..  using $self instead of `this` is a way to avoid having to .bind(this)
[08:54:27] <shoky_> .bind($self)   makes `this` === `$self` inside
[08:54:31] <Cork> codecutter: no, you can append nodes in one go
[08:54:38] <Cork> codecutter: it doesn't have to be strings
[08:54:38] <shoky_> bad code whatever the purpose
[08:55:12] <codecutter> shoky: that was leftover, will remove it
[08:55:15] <Cork> ehm... *append elements*
[08:55:18] <Cork> it isn't nodes
[08:55:27] <codecutter> right.
[08:56:29] <codecutter> how would append array of mustache template in one go?
[08:56:47] <codecutter> say i have an foo which contains bunch of mustache templates
[08:57:07] <codecutter> and i need to append it to .foo with one go
[08:57:19] <codecutter> actually me show the entire thing
[08:57:22] <codecutter> hang on..
[08:57:26] <codecutter> let me*
[08:57:32] <Cork> codecutter: you don't
[08:57:38] <Cork> you parse the templates into nodes
[08:57:38] <codecutter> go on...
[08:57:44] <Cork> ...
[08:57:53] <Cork> you parse the templates into elements
[08:58:03] <Cork> then you build and array of elements
[08:58:13] <Cork> and just .html(arr) or .append(arr)
[08:59:14] <decx> are these nodes that should be included all in the same place or what?
[09:00:14] <Cork> else having them as a string wouldn't make a difference
[09:00:20] <decx> just write your own virtual dom and do tree diff, who needs react right
[09:00:30] <decx> o/
[09:08:19] <codecutter> it's way more complex than it but I managed to strip down to show what i'm doing http://pastebin.com/wpUjjpa0
[09:08:26] <codecutter> than it shows*
[09:08:49] <codecutter> actually slightly more complex than it seems
[09:10:10] <codecutter> there maybe some typos but thats becuase I edited it the actual to strip it down so ignore parameter differences and other typos that exists
[09:10:57] <codecutter> there maybe some typos, thats becuause I edited the script to strip it down to bare minimum so ignore parameter differences and other typos that exists
[09:10:59] <codecutter> *
[09:11:50] <codecutter> function on line 27 returns a mutache template
[09:12:15] <codecutter> line 22 then return the html as string
[09:12:38] <codecutter> line 12 is where all posts are merged into a single string
[09:12:50] <codecutter> insert in line 5
[09:15:55] <codecutter> What i'm i doing wrong?
[09:16:36] <Uhkis> using pastebin instead of jsfiddle for one =)
[09:17:59] <codecutter> jsfiddle is for troubleshooting
[09:18:09] <codecutter> my question is more about the design
[09:18:16] <codecutter> scripts runs
[09:18:25] <codecutter> with no errors
[09:29:58] <codecutter> Cork: how would you 'parse' a mustache template into an element?
[09:30:13] <codecutter> can i see an example?
[09:30:56] <Cork> codecutter: $($.parseHTML(output_from_template_engine))
[09:31:58] <Cork> then you can just do newElements = newElements.add($.parseHTML()) until you have processed it all
[09:32:10] <Cork> and newElements should be a jquery element with all of the elements
[09:32:40] <Cork> alternatively, if the template only have one outer element you can use an array
[09:32:59] <Cork> var arr=[]; arr.push($.parseHTML(output_from_template_engine))
[09:33:13] <Cork> and then when you're done just do $('#target').append(arr)
[09:33:28] <Cork> (or $('#target').html(arr))
[09:33:51] <codecutter> htmlTemplateArr.push($($.parseHTML(htmlTemplate)));  -> [n.fn.init, n.fn.init, n.fn.init, n.fn.init]
[09:34:41] <codecutter> Cork: ^
[09:35:11] <Cork> codecutter: you combined the top options
[09:35:16] <Cork> read the array example again
[09:35:31] <Cork> (hint no $())
[09:36:47] <codecutter> htmlTemplateArr.push($.parseHTML(htmlTemplate)); .-> [null, null, null]
[09:37:34] <Cork> codecutter: you need to parse the template first
[09:37:47] <Cork> the result from the templating should be put into the array
[09:38:31] <codecutter> htmlTemplate contains the actual template
[09:38:35] <codecutter> let me print out
[09:38:39] <codecutter> 1 sec
[09:39:27] <codecutter> htmlTemplate -> [li]
[09:39:36] <Cork> that isn't a template
[09:39:41] <Cork> that is a list of elements
[09:39:46] <codecutter> oh
[09:40:00] <codecutter> that means i already have the elements, not to parse
[09:40:03] <codecutter> :)
[09:40:05] <Cork> ya
[09:40:07] <codecutter> no need*
[09:40:21] <Cork> you just have to reference them with jquery and attach the data
[09:41:14] <codecutter> hang on
[09:41:31] <codecutter> why is the array giving me? [n.fn.init[1], n.fn.init[1], n.fn.init[1], n.fn.init[1], n.fn.init[1], n.fn.init[1], n.fn.init[1]]
[09:41:49] <codecutter> but the variable gives me an element?
[09:41:58] <codecutter> i'm placing the variable in the array
[09:42:01] <codecutter> hmm
[09:44:15] <Cork> codecutter: you shouldn't store the jquery wrapped element
[09:44:21] <Cork> use jquery to target the element
[09:44:31] <Cork> then use the original raw dom element to push it into the array
[09:44:32] <codecutter> what does that mean?
[09:45:25] <Cork> var newEntry = input; $(newEntry).data('foo', bar); arr.push(newEntry);
[09:45:36] <codecutter> line 2, 4 http://pastebin.com/cdrwpEsS
[09:46:11] <Cork> ah, so preparePostHtmlTemplate gives you a jquery object
[09:48:08] <codecutter> not sure why it would behave like that, variable seems to print element, but the array printts out the object
[09:48:23] <codecutter> how do i fix this?
[09:48:33] <Cork> codecutter: you don't really fix it
[09:48:38] <Cork> just use the other option
[09:48:51] <codecutter> what option will that be?
[09:48:51] <Cork> use .add and merge the jquery objects
[09:50:06] <codecutter> can i see an example?
[09:51:04] <Cork> i gave you one when we talked about it
[09:51:34] <codecutter> let me scroll up
[09:52:59] <codecutter> Cork: not sure which line you referring, can repaste it?
[09:53:25] <Cork> it starts with "then you can just do"
[09:53:30] <Cork> it is more then one line
[10:06:07] <codecutter> Cork: I can't seem to get it to work what kind of object is newElements?   "newElements = newElements.add($.parseHTML()) "
[10:06:15] <codecutter> is it n array?
[10:06:24] <Cork> codecutter: it is the one you call htmlTemplate
[10:06:42] <Cork> (though the name is very wrong)
[10:07:03] <codecutter> i know
[10:07:07] <codecutter> misleading
[10:07:14] <Cork> and $.parseHTML() is just the call to the template function
[10:09:05] <codecutter> Cork: how me http://pastebin.com/HFtMsytL
[10:09:08] <codecutter> show*
[10:09:28] <Cork> you need to store the result
[10:11:44] <codecutter> if i place it in an array (using push) in line 2 i get this [n.fn.init[1], n.fn.init[1], n.fn.init[1], n.fn.init[1], n.fn.init[1], n.fn.init[1], n.fn.init[1]]
[10:16:07] <codecutter> htmlTemplateArr.push(jQuery.parseHTML(htmlTemplate)); -> [null,null,null]
[11:23:02] <newsoft> Hi all
[11:23:52] <newsoft> I have a jQuery widget i made and i'd like to do something when this.element is resized. attached resize event for element, but it's never fired ?
[11:26:01] <newsoft> I dont want to bind on window, as resize could be triggered by parent div resize (widget inside a grid column)
[11:47:35] <flashpoint9> Im trying to add an event listener to an input, I want to check for the value and if larger than 9 do some stuff but its not working http://paste.ofcode.org/vXiFR4bbt6KGmGdvN2Pj2J
[11:48:48] <flashpoint9> Wait nevermind, the ID is changing on the page...
[11:49:22] <taplar> sidenote: var quantity = $('#edit-quantity').val();
[11:49:26] <taplar> var quantity = this.value
[12:48:19] <_August_> can someone take a quick look at my function? I am trying to call a function on a time at line 141 and 95 and i keep getting this error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'hasOwnProperty' of undefined" any suggestions? http://pastebin.com/K5ELpSuM
[12:49:26] <robertmaxrees> so it's the get_notes call that's busted?
[12:49:50] <robertmaxrees> what's ajax_trans do?
[12:49:51] <_August_> yeah when the time out goes into effect on line 141
[12:50:06] <_August_> basically ajax post callback
[12:50:22] <robertmaxrees> right so your code is tossing that shiz around soooo
[12:50:53] <_August_> hmm
[12:50:57] <robertmaxrees> 5bux says if you check your stack trace it'll be related to that.
[12:50:58] <_August_> i think i might know whats wrong
[13:04:53] <taplar> republicans
[13:04:59] * taplar goes back to eating
[13:05:03] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaa
[13:38:25] <zalem-developer> anyone here?
[13:38:55] <taplar> nah
[13:39:07] <taplar> sup?
[13:40:08] <zalem-developer> i have a noob question for jquery
[13:40:18] <taplar> my favorite kind
[13:40:42] <hamdjan> hi
[13:40:50] <taplar> bonjour
[13:41:26] <zalem-developer> i have an asp.net mvc application
[13:41:48] <zalem-developer> i have some jquery that makes a call to a method in a controller
[13:43:02] <zalem-developer> the url is correct and the 'data' is correct.   if i use data : { function () {return kendo.ui.ComboBox.requestData<blah><blah>).prop('id')}}  it works
[13:43:40] <zalem-developer> if i add another item to 'data'...and another parameter in my controller...it doesn't pass in the correct value....instead of the text...i get  [object Object]
[13:43:55] <robertmaxrees> probably passign the other item incorrectly.
[13:44:02] <robertmaxrees> show us what the actual code looks like :)
[13:44:09] <taplar> can you show an example of your ajax call?  hard to see with it one line like that
[13:44:27] <zalem-developer> one sec....on another computer because my damn job blocks everthing
[13:44:27] <taplar> seems like you got an extra {} around your method call there
[13:46:36] <zalem-developer> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/376948d265f1147800928d2e001e21fb
[13:46:52] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[13:47:06] <robertmaxrees> wait what.
[13:47:10] <robertmaxrees> what are you getting server-side?
[13:47:43] <robertmaxrees> beacuse what you're defining here is a function named text.
[13:47:49] <zalem-developer> i inherited this...i didn't write it
[13:47:59] <robertmaxrees> is this the original code ooorrr..?
[13:48:15] <zalem-developer> the original code just had
[13:48:26] <robertmaxrees> so show us the functioning version.
[13:48:33] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:48:55] <zalem-developer> data : { function () {return kendo.ui.ComboBox.requestData........prop('id')};}
[13:49:08] <zalem-developer> i need to send it another parameter to the controller
[13:49:17] <zalem-developer> controller method
[13:49:22] <robertmaxrees> that really doesn't make sense.
[13:49:24] <robertmaxrees> that defines a function.
[13:49:47] <zalem-developer> what doesn't make sense
[13:49:48] <taplar> .requestData........prop('id')  <-- that alone is a syntax error
[13:50:16] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:50:19] <robertmaxrees> that code is invalid.
[13:50:23] <robertmaxrees> share the actual functioning version :)
[13:50:32] <zalem-developer> ok
[13:50:34] <zalem-developer> one sec
[13:51:32] <ngharo> dont yall think this is what he's getting at: http://paste.debian.net/816117/
[13:51:45] <robertmaxrees> he's claiming that doesn't work.
[13:51:57] <taplar> i'm reserving my think for the moment
[13:52:02] <ngharo> hah
[13:52:40] <robertmaxrees> (all about the learning experience, yo :)
[13:53:26] <zalem-developer>  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/adf34ae7ac2b9b7ad49a87f3b9d1eb19
[13:53:30] <ngharo> i learn best by example but i realize not everyone does
[13:53:52] <taplar> yeah, i agree.  i don't see how that was working
[13:53:59] <robertmaxrees> i get it now.
[13:54:02] <taplar> unless the back didn't use the text at all
[13:54:14] <robertmaxrees> 5 bucks says that data thing takes a callback to fetch the data.
[13:54:27] <robertmaxrees> zalem-developer $.ajax() and this are not the same at all.
[13:54:36] <ngharo> does jquery eval the data function there?
[13:54:37] <robertmaxrees> you can convert to use plain ol' ajax, but it'll require a different setup.
[13:54:37] <taplar> ah
[13:54:47] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't do much of anything in this case.
[13:54:53] <robertmaxrees> this is all kendo.
[13:55:08] <zalem-developer> ok
[13:55:12] <ngharo> oh ya, duh
[13:55:19] <robertmaxrees> i'm giggling at $('#approver-lookup').prop('id')
[13:55:31] <ngharo> haha
[13:55:31] <taplar> :)
[13:56:00] <robertmaxrees> zalem-developer other than the code being a little weird, why not just update what's there?
[13:56:18] <robertmaxrees> make that callback return an object with your props.
[13:56:58] <zalem-developer> it may not be ideal...i'm a mobile developer and this was dumped on me...and i'm just trying to find a workaround.  i don't care what it should be or why it's working when it shouldn't.....and that's what i'm trying to do...i need to send another parameter to the controller action
[13:57:23] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have a kendo question then ;)
[13:57:34] <robertmaxrees> eirther way, make that callback return an object with two props.
[13:57:56] <zalem-developer> yeah...i don't know why it goes haywire when i try to add an additional parm
[13:58:10] <robertmaxrees> because you're adding it wrong ;)
[13:58:11] <taplar> well it looks like it's returning a single 'something'
[13:58:19] <taplar> whatever requestData() returns
[13:58:23] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[13:59:53] <zalem-developer> yes, it's returning an IEnumerable list of object....i think what i can do ..try to figure out what i want to do in 'success'..versus jack around w/ it on the server
[13:59:58] <robertmaxrees> http://www.telerik.com/support
[14:00:03] <robertmaxrees> this is what you want.
[14:00:53] <zalem-developer> robert, i appreciate your help but i can do without the sarcasm today....i just hope you don't get a mobile app thrown in your lap and someone responds by calling contact apple support
[14:00:59] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[14:01:04] <robertmaxrees> i'm not being sarcastic.
[14:01:07] <robertmaxrees> i'm being 100% serious.
[14:01:12] <zalem-developer> ok
[14:01:12] <zalem-developer> cool
[14:01:22] <zalem-developer> and i did send in a request to them!  :)
[14:01:25] <robertmaxrees> great!
[14:01:28] <zalem-developer> waiting on the response
[14:01:35] <zalem-developer> but i appreciate your help
[14:01:42] <zalem-developer> and that i'm serious about
[14:02:02] <robertmaxrees> dunno why you assumed i was being sarcastic.  sounds like your frustrated.
[14:02:13] <zalem-developer> i am
[14:02:20] <zalem-developer> not going to explain....
[14:02:23] <zalem-developer> who'd listen!
[14:02:28] <zalem-developer> but i appreciate your help
[14:02:29] <taplar> i am
[14:02:37] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you could declare an object set to that value and then create a prop on that obkject afterward.
[14:03:03] <robertmaxrees> like https://bpaste.net/show/8dfe053e20ee
[14:03:31] <robertmaxrees> but hey maybe my sarcasm is too much ;)
[14:03:48] <taplar> you can do the '.' set on an IEnumerable ?
[14:04:01] <robertmaxrees> this is a js object.
[14:04:06] <robertmaxrees> not the backend.
[14:04:10] <taplar> ah, gotcha
[14:04:14] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:04:26] <taplar> i was confused on that bit, :)
[14:04:32] <robertmaxrees> word
[14:05:19] <zalem-developer> sorry..just got pulled in on a damn conference call
[14:05:31] <robertmaxrees> look at that bpaste
[14:07:26] <zalem-developer> oh yes, i saw it
[14:07:27] <zalem-developer> and i will try it
[14:07:36] <robertmaxrees> no guarantee it'll work, but you get the idea.
[14:07:49] <robertmaxrees> also follow through with the kendo folks because there may be a better way to get what you want.
[14:08:17] <taplar> yeah. like maybe changing the selector to match both the elements
[14:08:22] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:08:47] <taplar> what are your two selectors?
[14:09:19] <taplar> '#approver-lookup' and ?
[14:09:57] <zalem-developer> guys, i'm sorry.....i'm on a conference call...and it's rare to find help on here
[14:10:03] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:10:33] <zalem-developer> i'm on a conference call..and a user is in the middle of the damn dessert and can barely hear him
[14:10:40] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[14:10:48] <taplar> do you usually come in here on the weekends?  usually there are people in here willing to offer help
[14:10:54] <zalem-developer> no no
[14:10:59] <zalem-developer> been a very long time since i came on here
[14:11:05] <robertmaxrees> he means the dude he's trying to help maybe?
[14:11:19] <zalem-developer> they block all kinds of stuff and i'm on a borrowed laptop
[14:11:26] <zalem-developer> connected to the adjacent hotel's wifi!
[14:11:45] <taplar> hear that
[14:12:02] <zalem-developer> but i don't want you guys to think i'm pissed or sarcastic at you guys
[14:12:05] <taplar> my place's vpn blocks tons of stuff
[14:12:16] <robertmaxrees> zalem-developer just relax.  it's all good :)
[14:12:35] <zalem-developer> that's like the 10th time someone told me to relax today
[14:12:47] <robertmaxrees> you're just acting really angry at us.
[14:12:53] <robertmaxrees> :) it's all good though.
[14:12:59] <zalem-developer> sorry guys...misdirected anger/frustration
[14:13:22] <taplar> just like my many users who fill out feedback tabs, ^_^
[14:13:40] <robertmaxrees> taplar knows the struggle.
[14:15:14] <AwkwardCough> ^ no kidding
[14:15:16] <taplar> i only say that cause today was interesting viewing some of the feedback.  you'd think the world was ending
[14:15:49] <robertmaxrees> we have all our customer feedback into a chat room and watch it in real time.
[14:15:55] <zalem-developer> the signature of my method in my controller is ActionResult ApproverLookup(string text)
[14:16:00] <zalem-developer> what should I change it to
[14:16:04] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[14:16:07] <robertmaxrees> that's .net land
[14:16:07] <zalem-developer> if i use robot's pase
[14:16:10] <zalem-developer> ok
[14:16:30] <taplar> can we go back to my other question?  what are the two selectors you have?
[14:17:16] <zalem-developer> taplar...i don't know what you mean by that
[14:17:18] <zalem-developer> i'm sorry
[14:17:28] <taplar> '#approver-lookup' is the existing one, but your trying to add another
[14:17:32] <taplar> what's the other one?
[14:18:09] <zalem-developer> i'm trying to add another parameter to the controller that's called on the .net side
[14:18:26] <robertmaxrees> heh taplar i wouldn't push it.
[14:18:27] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:18:34] <robertmaxrees> something tells me he's not too worried about that part ;)
[14:18:42] <taplar> k
[14:19:56] <zalem-developer> no i'm not
[14:19:59] <zalem-developer> thanks for the help guys
[14:20:11] <robertmaxrees> lol good luck mang.
[14:20:13] <taplar> what does an array look like in .net?
[14:20:18] <taplar> string[] ?
[14:20:34] * taplar googs
[14:21:29] <taplar> sweet got it right
[14:21:31] <AwkwardCough> if memory serves, thats what they are like string[] arrayname
[14:21:39] <taplar> it's still similar to C
[14:22:13] <taplar> you did .net ?
[14:22:28] <antraxis> should i use controller or directive in angular to create custom ui element?
[14:22:52] * taplar double checks that this is still the jquery room
[14:23:12] <robertmaxrees> antraxis i'd ask in a channel about angular.
[14:23:20] <antraxis> i asked
[14:23:22] <antraxis> no response
[14:23:28] <robertmaxrees> you spammed a bunch of different channels at once ;)
[14:23:34] <robertmaxrees> and that doesn't change the topic of this channel :D
[14:23:45] <antraxis> yeah and as you can notice, no response anywhere
[14:24:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:24:17] <taplar> i guess asking a doctor and asking a vet the same question about your dog should net you the same answer...
[14:24:18] <Yepp> my .on('click') does not fire when element is clicked. But if you do trigger('click), .click() on the console the event callback is fired
[14:24:30] <Yepp> it's just the real click itself that does not get it fired
[14:24:36] <robertmaxrees> Yepp have another element over it?
[14:24:49] <Yepp> nope, attached the handler to itself
[14:24:50] <robertmaxrees> like, if you right-click it and inspect, does the element itself actually get selected?
[14:24:52] <antraxis> taplar: thanks for philosopihcal support
[14:25:06] <taplar> :D one of my many roles here
[14:25:07] <Yepp> yes
[14:25:22] <robertmaxrees> Yepp no idea then.  i'd have to seeit
[14:26:15] <disputin> I have a table with cells (td) that may or may not contain divs, I'm trying to create a selector that will select the <td> text, but not the contents of the divs with class visible-xs
[14:26:46] <taplar> do the tds have text outside of those divs?
[14:27:02] <disputin> some might just be tds with text and no divs
[14:27:18] <taplar> ok, so it's not going to be mixed within a given td
[14:27:35] <disputin> no a td either has text or divs
[14:27:51] <AwkwardCough> so no mixed cases of a td having both?
[14:27:57] <disputin> nope
[14:27:58] <robertmaxrees> can you show us an example disputin?
[14:28:05] <Yepp> robertmaxrees: tried to remove all js codes and still does not work
[14:28:08] <Yepp> here btw: http://www.hastebin.com/afuyevaniy.django
[14:28:35] <Yepp> even tried calling the id itself instead of the cached one but still no luck
[14:28:58] <robertmaxrees> Yepp can you share the rendered html?
[14:29:05] <robertmaxrees> js doesn't read django templates :)
[14:29:45] <Yepp> that's laravel's blade :v anyway you just gave me an idea. I'll look in to the rendered one
[14:30:58] <robertmaxrees> hah i wasn't even paying attention.
[14:30:58] <disputin> http://pastebin.com/6tX4nwz6
[14:31:08] * AwkwardCough googles laravel's blade....disappointed not an actual sword
[14:32:28] <robertmaxrees> i'd tackle this a little differently tbh.
[14:33:22] <robertmaxrees> i'd get each td's text and then just remove the stuff that matches the TDs.
[14:33:25] <robertmaxrees> err, those divs.
[14:34:13] <disputin> the problem with the div content is repetitive and when I get the text both divs are mixed together
[14:34:25] <disputin> for one td
[14:34:29] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't matter :)
[14:34:47] <disputin> oh?
[14:34:52] * disputin is all ears
[14:35:09] <robertmaxrees> you can .each() over those divs and do a .remove();
[14:35:16] <robertmaxrees> err, .replace() with an empty string.
[14:35:33] <disputin> ok thanks, let me look at thatâ€¦
[14:35:46] <robertmaxrees> i'll give you the freeby since it can seem a little stanky
[14:36:15] <taplar> i'm trying this along those lines, but it's not working yet https://jsfiddle.net/m3tu8qhc/
[14:38:35] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/m3tu8qhc/1/ seems to work
[14:40:08] <robertmaxrees> that works.
[14:40:35] <robertmaxrees> oh my idea was flawed.
[14:40:43] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/m3tu8qhc/2/
[14:43:21] <zalem-developer> is robert there??
[14:43:30] <robertmaxrees> lots of people are here.
[14:43:41] <robertmaxrees> can ask questions to the channel :) people will help if they can :D
[14:43:45] <zalem-developer> robert!
[14:43:51] <zalem-developer> your suggestion worked!!!!!!
[14:44:38] <robertmaxrees> cool
[14:44:44] <robertmaxrees> i'd still ask the kendo folks.
[14:44:48] <robertmaxrees> but neat
[14:45:05] <zalem-developer> phuck them...hate that stuff
[14:45:08] <zalem-developer> but thanks to you and the other guy
[14:45:09] <robertmaxrees> erm
[14:45:18] <robertmaxrees> you're using kendo, so you'll want to ask anyway :)
[14:50:01] <rjCousineau> Hello, how come jsfiddle.net doesnt let $( function(){}) jquery work on a fresh fiddle?
[14:50:18] <rjCousineau> do you have include jquery as an external resource?
[14:50:30] <disputin> https://jsfiddle.net/m3tu8qhc/3/  I'm not sure this works, it's showing div's regardless of the class
[14:50:43] <disputin> I'm trying to select only one class
[14:51:36] <robertmaxrees> rjCousineau there's a dropdown for it.
[14:51:54] <rjCousineau> robertmaxrees: now i see it.. thanks!
[14:53:16] <taplar> disputin: what do you mean 'showing' ?
[14:53:47] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/m3tu8qhc/5/
[14:53:51] <rjCousineau> Hello. I have nested checkboxes and I'm trying to migrate the check event to it's children.. It works, but buggy and I'm not sure why.  I made a fiddle. https://jsfiddle.net/5uk4fnyn/1/
[14:53:54] <zalem-developer> taper...thanks for your help earlier
[14:54:04] <taplar> np man
[14:54:38] <robertmaxrees> rjCousineau you want prop, not attr
[14:55:00] <rjCousineau> robertmaxrees: wow, thanks!
[14:55:27] <robertmaxrees> always use prop.  there are very rare cases that you want to use attr()
[14:55:50] <taplar> that could be reduced btw
[14:56:00] <taplar> this.checked is what your using as the last boolean
[14:56:05] <taplar> essentially
[14:56:25] <robertmaxrees> even better, you don't need the if/else
[14:56:33] <rjCousineau> yea?
[14:56:42] <taplar> $(this).closest('li').find('input[type=checkbox]').prop('checked', this.checked);
[14:56:48] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:57:02] <rjCousineau> money
[14:57:33] <taplar> one of my programmer pet peeves, lol.  if ( x == y ) return true; else return false;
[14:57:40] <rjCousineau> taplar: nice, it works
[14:57:44] <robertmaxrees> boom
[14:58:58] <rjCousineau> thanks
[15:04:22] <taplar> if i might suggest something though
[15:04:51] <taplar> i might suggest putting a class on the parent checkboxes and bind on those, either directly or as a delegate
[15:05:06] <taplar> cause with your current logic, it's going to be doing extra work for the child checkboxes
[15:05:12] <taplar> with 0 results
[15:05:19] <taplar> s/results/changes
[15:05:19] <b-ot> Correction, <taplar> with 0 changes
[15:07:46] <taplar> or instead of going up to the li, go down to the ul li

[17:50:22] <tona> ok
[18:06:35] <taplar> *coughinlineblockcough*
[19:01:03] <BrendyBum>  is this correct syntax for setting css property and value variables in js? document.getElementById.style.setProperty('--left', '$leftposition');
[19:01:56] <robertmaxrees> document.getElementById('someId').style.left = someVariable
[19:03:09] <BrendyBum> robertmaxrees: ty
[19:04:23] <robertmaxrees> fwiw there's  ajquery way as well.
[19:05:10] <robertmaxrees> in the spirit of the room ;)

[22:56:16] <b1tchcakes> how can I do this: $('name=filter_times[1][to_time]').val('13:00');
[22:56:29] <dni-> m i the really only one left??? ;d
[22:56:40] <b1tchcakes> it's multi select name I'm trying to get

[22:56:59] <dni-> i think your selector is wront
[22:57:30] <dni-> ^^
[22:57:40] <b1tchcakes> <input name="filter_times[1][is_active]">
[22:57:51] <taplar> put quotes around the name
[22:58:02] <dni-> looks strange

[23:01:05] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/0bbk2fmm/
[23:01:18] <b1tchcakes> I'm actually using it to change the value of a dropdown select.  would I do it the same?  it's not altering it.
[23:01:42] <taplar> the value you set the select to has to exist as a value="" on an option
[23:02:59] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/0bbk2fmm/1/
[23:03:27] <b1tchcakes> ahh.  got it.  thanks so much.
