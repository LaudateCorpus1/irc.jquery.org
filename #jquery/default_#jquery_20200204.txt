[03:15:09] <Bluerate>  hello all, I have icon link when i clicked it should open the main menu but it opened when double-clicked .. how to open it with one click?
[03:24:04] <Cork> Bluerate: you most likely bind the handler on a click so the first click is lost
[03:24:29] <Cork> but hard to say without seeing the code

[13:06:57] <GSL> What is the preferred way of getting private reports of security issues in jquery-ui?
[13:07:49] <z1haze> does .always get called on jqxhr.abort()?
[13:27:23] <taplar> z1haze https://jsfiddle.net/s2zvwd8p/  always should happen on resolve/reject, and that appears to include aborts.
[13:34:48] <z1haze> thank you
[14:02:41] <taplar> woah, did the network drop or something?
[14:46:51] <rocketmagnet> hi everyone, can someone help me and tell me what's wrong with https://jsfiddle.net/7Laspwv4/ ?
[14:47:16] <rocketmagnet> i mean https://jsfiddle.net/7Laspwv4/1/
[14:49:54] <taplar> rocketmagnet that doesn't look like it contains any jQuery
[14:50:02] <rocketmagnet> i know
[14:50:33] <taplar> ##javasript
[14:50:35] <rocketmagnet> i thought maybe have time, #javascript is in a discussion
[14:50:37] <taplar> ##javascript
[15:19:39] <rocketmagnet> i get no reply at ##javascript and i'm new to js and i'm not able to find something with google or duckduckgo that helps me further
[15:20:15] <mrnicej> How to get output like it says here --> https://jsfiddle.net/dw7zg0sb/
[15:20:58] <taplar> mrnicej an actual array or an object with those keys?
[15:21:21] <taplar> because `array` there is an object, not an array
[15:23:40] <taplar> also keep in mind your fiddle isn't going to function with your trs not being in an actual table
[15:24:41] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/t1kq5s8z/
[15:25:16] <mrnicej> the output should be like.... 1: {apple: "3"} and then another 2: {strawberry: "3"}
[15:25:38] <taplar> Yeah, again, that still doesn't make that object an array
[15:26:43] <mrnicej> taplar: thats correct way
[15:26:55] <taplar> ?
[15:26:56] <mrnicej> thx so much
[15:27:01] <taplar> sure
[15:27:37] <mrnicej> taplar: thx for the table fix also :D  haha missed that
[15:28:00] <taplar> yeah, trs on their own are not recognized by the browser. so the selector would not find them

[17:38:51] <zdgrtftfdrtguopm> Hi. Is it true that use of the method .keypress() is no longer recommended ?

[21:45:10] <advorak> hi there.
[21:53:53] <advorak> I'm not sure if this is jquery-specific or javascript-specific .. I'm using pushState and location.href .. https://gist.github.com/advorak/fcac53d0e7cfa2f2b870ecdcfbf11482
[21:54:55] <advorak> When the user hits the "back" button, I want it to reload the content as the URL replaced by window.history.pushState() ...
[23:00:45] <ButtDog> On thre launch modal here: file:///home/m3/Desktop/canva/HTML/modal-popovers.html  $(#'myModal') to be specific. How can I prevent it from closing when people click outside of it?
[23:09:50] <ButtDog> I found a solution actually. data-keyboard=false and data-backdrop=static didn't work, but e.preventDefault(); on the modal click worked
