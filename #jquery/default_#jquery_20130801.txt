[00:14:30] <dbcclarke> Hey, Can someone help me on inserting a JQplot on my webpage? I've tried the example code here http://www.jqplot.com/docs/files/usage-txt.html but it still doesn't work.
[00:17:50] <sammych> An unexpected token ")" was found following "blah".  Expected tokens may include:  ")"
[00:18:10] <sammych> gee. thanks for your help
[00:32:46] <jeremy--> I want to grab a LI by selector and .appendTo() but also create the UL around it at the same time
[00:33:40] <jeremy--> is it possible to mix html and selectors in the $("selector").appendTo
[00:48:57] <FND> I just realized an inconsistency with `.data`: http://jsfiddle.net/fzFvH/ -- is this a known issue (kinda hard to search for existing tickets)
[00:56:58] <jokke> hello!
[00:57:51] <jokke> i'm using select2 for a project and i wonder if it's possible to change the id of the input element. currently it is s2id_autogen1
[00:59:02] <xec_> jokke: that seems like a strange thing to want to do
[00:59:15] <xec_> may i ask why?
[00:59:18] <jokke> sure
[00:59:32] <jokke> it's a rails project and by convention the id should be something else
[00:59:49] <jokke> im using it to select (or create) tags
[01:00:07] <xec_> is the plugin creating the id?
[01:00:14] <jokke> seems so
[01:00:31] <jokke> http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/#documentation
[01:00:43] <jokke> i couldn't find anything regarding the id
[01:02:06] <xec_> in the example code on that page, the IDs look predefined
[01:02:30] <xec_> does your input have an ID to start with?
[01:02:41] <jokke> its not an input in my case
[01:02:49] <jokke> its a div that select2 turns into an input
[01:02:50] <celediw> hello
[01:03:57] <xec_> jokke: are you posting the form using ajax or just letting the browser handle it?
[01:04:08] <jokke> no ajax
[01:04:18] <jokke> its in a form that gets posted
[01:04:40] <jokke> the existing tags are defined on page load
[01:05:24] <xec_> tags?
[01:05:39] <jokke> yes its a cms and content should have tags
[01:05:51] <xec_> as in html?
[01:05:54] <jokke> like in a blog
[01:05:55] <jokke> no
[01:06:04] <jokke> kind of like categories
[01:06:08] <xec_> i see
[01:06:15] <jokke> they are stored in a db
[01:06:33] <xec_> why are you using a div instead of an input?
[01:07:48] <celediw> need help ppl, my script working in ff but not in chrome. The problem is that i need to use async:false option.
[01:07:54] <jokke> normally one would use a select tag but then it does not support adding new items
[01:08:13] <jokke> thats why i need to use a div
[01:08:50] <xec_> that doesn't make much sense - in what way does a div "support adding new items" and a select not
[01:09:09] <jokke> well select2 _turns_ the div into an input
[01:09:53] <xec_> yes, i got that part, would it do that if it was an input already?
[01:09:53] <jokke> believe me i tried using a select and would've been happy if it had just worked
[01:09:57] <jop008> Anyone works with https://github.com/nolimits4web/Swiper#swiper-200---updated-on-june-22-2013?
[01:10:16] <xec_> jokke: any chance you could make a live demo?
[01:10:17] <jokke> xec_: worth a try
[01:10:30] <jokke> i don't think so
[01:10:50] <jokke> i'll try with input first
[01:12:21] <xec_> i mean, you *could* probably change the ID, but you might break something (if the plugin generates IDs, it probably uses them for something, and if the div already have the proper ID, you can't use it again on the same page)
[01:14:23] <xec_> celediw: so it's a timing issue? do you have a demo?
[01:14:45] <jokke> xec_: https://paste.xinu.at/6G6JwU/haml
[01:14:47] <jokke> this
[01:14:51] <jokke> gets turned into
[01:15:13] <celediw> xec_: yep, http://jsfiddle.net/Geqbb/4/
[01:15:24] <celediw> it's not exactly code but close
[01:16:05] <celediw> problem is that chrome "freeze"
[01:16:17] <celediw> when firefox not the same way
[01:16:50] <xec_> celediw: does the console say anything?
[01:16:56] <xec_> celediw: line 31 looks wrong
[01:17:10] <jokke> https://paste.xinu.at/nWyy/html
[01:17:12] <jokke> this
[01:17:27] <xec_> celediw: success option takes a function, you can't just type code there
[01:17:35] <celediw> no, when i add consol.log to steps it works ok
[01:17:54] <celediw> sorry, my bad. But as i write it's only exaple of idea
[01:18:04] <xec_> jokke: i'm not too familiar with haml, can you post the generated html?
[01:18:21] <jokke> i did :)
[01:18:31] <jokke> second paste
[01:18:41] <xec_> jokke: that's from the DOM, not html, right?
[01:18:54] <xec_> jokke: i.e. transformed client side after plugin has run?
[01:18:59] <jokke> sure
[01:19:08] <xec_> well, what does the html look like
[01:19:28] <xec_> what does the server send to the browser
[01:22:41] <celediw> I've also post about my problem at jquery community on G+ but didn't get any answer till now
[01:23:30] <jokke> xec_: something like this: https://paste.xinu.at/iAU/html
[01:24:12] <jokke> haml isn't really that complicated
[01:24:22] <xec_> it might not matter, but that html doesnt look valid to me
[01:24:28] <xec_> input is a void element
[01:24:41] <xec_> you can't put a script inside it ...
[01:24:46] <jokke> hm
[01:24:59] <jokke> seems like i can :D
[01:25:14] <xec_> the browser is probably just ignoring the </input>
[01:25:24] <jokke> hm
[01:25:36] <jokke> well i also tried with a div
[01:25:41] <xec_> valid html isn't everything though
[01:28:49] <xec_> jokke: there's also a missing ")" after the doc ready function
[01:29:00] <jokke> well i just wrote that down
[01:32:18] <miCSu> I'm getting data via ajax from confluence rest api to another site but while I'm processing links, the link title is given as an attribute while in xml format and it breaks the scandic chars when changing to json format, is there anything I can do to fix chars like Ã¶ ? already tried changing the contentType charset utf-8, iso-8859-1, iso-8859-15, windows-1252 etc
[01:40:50] <celediw> miCSu: do you check when chars breaks ?
[01:41:11] <celediw> maybe json get it broken
[01:41:21] <miCSu> it's already broken from rest api output
[01:42:03] <miCSu> propably because it's originally an attribute
[01:44:08] <xec_> miCSu: if you get broken output from the server, you need a server-side fix (anything else will be a hack)
[01:44:27] <miCSu> ok
[01:45:20] <xec_> if there are a limited set of characters, and you don't have access to the server code, you could "fix" it with a simple string replace
[01:46:10] <xec_> setting a charset won't help if it's already broken
[01:50:02] <celediw> xec_: do you saw priv chat from me
[01:57:03] <xec_> celediw: yes but it's a bit messy and i'm a bit busy. the demo you posted is useless (because it's not your actual code and id doesn't do or demonstrate anything)
[02:00:34] <celediw> xec_: i understand, but becouse of ajax request it can't be functional
[02:01:13] <rose_> in my project iam using openseadragon.it uses many overlays.one overlay is made fixed by overriding its css properties.it works fine in the browser.But inside the mobile all overlays can be seen except the fixed one.when i avoid  the mobile meta tags  it can be seen.but my app is  a mobile app.how could i fix this problem?
[02:02:07] <xec_> celediw: you can fake it with timeout, or check out the "ajax requests" button in jsfiddle
[02:03:30] <marcules> rose_, you could overrule it - and apply your own inline css... I know it's ugly :D
[02:08:00] <Doggie52> In this snippet (http://pastebin.com/Xbr63qRN), what does '$editables' refer to? Is that a variable? I thought it would just be 'editables' in that case, if it was a jquery selector that one had saved.
[02:08:46] <Doggie52> I'm confused about there being a dollar sign in front of the name
[02:08:51] <xec_> Doggie52: some people prefix variables with $ to indicate it's a jquery object
[02:08:56] <Doggie52> Ohhh
[02:09:01] <Doggie52> So it's just a naming convention basically?
[02:09:05] <xec_> yes.
[02:09:07] <Doggie52> Ah
[02:09:09] <xec_> personally, i never do that :P
[02:09:09] <Doggie52> Thanks for that
[02:09:18] <Doggie52> Me neither :D but then again I didn't know
[02:09:26] <rose_> marcules the overlays are recieved from json
[02:16:28] <initself> my buttons both seems to do the same thing?
[02:16:29] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/YkUeM/1/
[02:16:30] <initself> any ideas?
[02:21:37] <SargoDarya> initself: hide_quotes_total_amount('toggle')
[02:22:03] <SargoDarya> is that right?
[02:22:20] <initself> something is messed up
[02:22:50] <initself> SargoDarya: i think it is?
[02:23:04] <SargoDarya> ok, what should happen when?
[02:23:12] <initself> good question
[02:23:25] <initself> basically, on start, both should run and hide
[02:23:51] <initself> after that, when one is clicked, show all of the rows and then hide or show only the rows pertaining to that button
[02:25:32] <SargoDarya> hm, do you know which button does something wrong?
[02:26:46] <initself> seems like the values get out of alignment or something
[02:26:56] <initself> it's hard to make my fiddle show what i mean
[02:31:31] <initself> i wonder if :eq is totaly wrong
[02:36:02] <zulu-gula> how to hide field collection in display suite when collection is empty/
[02:36:03] <zulu-gula> ?
[02:42:34] <snorti> when i have a [object HTMLTableRowElement] in a "var tr" is there a way to jump on the one bevore?
[02:43:24] <sonOfRa> .prev() returns the previous sibling
[02:44:14] <sonOfRa> <tr id="1"></tr><tr id="2"></tr><tr id="3"></tr>---$("#2").prev() should give you the tr with id 1
[02:44:33] <initself> SargoDarya: http://jsfiddle.net/YkUeM/9/
[02:44:56] <initself> clicking "Show Converted Quotes", you can never get 'C'
[02:45:14] <initself> clicking "Show Quotes < $250", you can never get 'B'
[02:45:42] <initself> actually, that's not quite right, either!?
[02:46:39] <SargoDarya> if (value <= total_amount) { check++; }
[02:47:00] <SargoDarya> all things checked get toggle()
[02:47:09] <SargoDarya> total_amount = 250
[02:47:22] <initself> the confusion is just about what happens when you click one button and then the other.....
[02:47:22] <SargoDarya> the buttons says Show quotes < $250
[02:47:46] <initself> the toggle buttons work great in and of themselves
[02:48:05] <initself> wait...
[02:48:13] <initself> yes.
[02:48:33] <SargoDarya> Did it click?
[02:48:36] <initself> so when, it starts, it suppresses anything with a value in 'Order Number'.
[02:48:46] <initself> It also suppress anything < 250.00
[02:49:14] <initself> If you click, Show Converted Quotes, it will display anything with a value in 'Order Number' but also keep displaying 'D'
[02:50:06] <initself> god dammit
[02:50:13] <initself> i can't get to the end of the thought.
[02:50:19] * initself might be too tired.
[02:50:50] <SargoDarya> Pro-Tip: Scribble the flow on a piece of paper. Then translate the paper into code.
[02:50:58] <SargoDarya> It really helps when you do complex things like this
[02:52:07] <initself> the behavior i want is: start supressing both, if you click 'Show Converted Quotes', it means 'Show Converted Quotes NOT < 250'.
[02:52:15] <initself> instead it shows all of them.
[02:52:50] <SargoDarya> Would be better to do stuff like this with angular.js.
[02:52:54] <SargoDarya> So much easier.
[02:53:01] * initself looks.
[02:53:21] <SargoDarya> Your code does only one thing without regarding the other thing
[02:53:31] <initself> that looks like some serious overhead.
[02:53:35] <initself> SargoDarya: yes.
[02:53:49] <initself> it needs to regard the other thing, at least i konw that!
[02:54:16] <SargoDarya> Well, from looking at the code it doesn't do that so you need to do make same flags
[02:54:53] <initself> exactly
[02:55:14] * initself experiences dejavu.

[05:03:49] <shahin8r> Anyone know how to tweak the responsiveness of this bxslider plugin? I would like to whenever the full width of the element is not displayed it would disappear so it just shows the elements that it can fully show. See this: http://bxslider.com/examples/carousel-dynamic-number-slides
[05:11:09] <shahin8r> nvm, managed to do this good enough with media queries
[05:11:47] <airdem> blur() and change() seem to be identical
[05:12:15] <airdem> is there a "true" .change() event? that doesnt wait for losing focus to get fired?
[05:12:47] <samuelchan> airdem: use keyup
[05:13:03] <airdem> but im not pressing any key
[05:13:08] <airdem> still?
[05:13:29] <samuelchan> so...if you're not pressing anything, why do you want change to get fired?
[05:13:34] <samuelchan> or you just want to fire the change event?
[05:13:45] <samuelchan> in which case, just go $el.change()
[05:13:56] <airdem> im using a <datalist>
[05:14:00] <samuelchan> which is a shortcut for .trigger('change')
[05:14:10] <airdem> and i want to fire an event every time the datalist changes the value of another input field
[05:14:48] <airdem> shouldnt matter whether i click on a datalist <option> or select it via pressing enter
[05:16:27] <samuelchan> just call change() from whereever you need it to be caled
[05:17:02] <airdem> its not working
[05:17:09] <airdem> it only gets fired after losing focus
[05:17:26] <airdem> keyup works if i select an option via enter
[05:17:32] <airdem> but not if i select it via mouseclick
[05:17:41] <airdem> tryed click, doesnt work
[05:17:42] <__machine> is there any way to get the value of the `width` CSS attribute that is applied from a CSS class, or null if there is no width defined in css (instead of the automatic element width)?
[05:18:11] <airdem> __alex, .css('width')
[05:18:25] <airdem> __machine,

[05:19:30] <samuelchan> airdem: http://jsfiddle.net/fHxyJ/
[05:19:32] <__machine> airdem: that gives the current calculated / dynamic width when no width is actually defined in css
[05:19:49] <airdem> __machine, no, it gives the css witdh
[05:19:58] <airdem> .width gives the calculated
[05:20:20] <snorti> airdem: no i tried dat
[05:20:22] <snorti> hm
[05:21:03] <snorti> airdem: can you show me an example http://jsfiddle.net/CqgYb/
[05:22:59] <airdem> snorti, http://jsfiddle.net/CqgYb/2/

[05:27:28] <airdem> __machine, http://jsfiddle.net/97Nan/3/ ??
[05:29:34] <snorti> airdem: why you add a new feature. try to set it in my function. i aint get rid of it
[05:29:41] <__machine> airdem: that doesnt help me... i want to detect when the select element (or any other element that is by default sized automatically to fit its content) either has a `width` defined or doesnt... when there is a width defined, no problem .css('width') gives me that... but when there is no width defined, .css('width') still gives me the calculated width
[05:30:26] <airdem> __machine, .hasAttr('width')
[05:30:59] <__machine> airdem: thats checking an html attribute not a css `width` ?
[05:31:14] <__machine> and a css width might be defined inline, or in a class or with an #id etc
[05:31:21] <airdem> __machine, use classes
[05:31:26] <airdem> hasClass()
[05:32:00] <snorti> airdem: you aint get rid of it too?
[05:32:36] <airdem> snorti, in your click function use $(this).prev()
[05:32:48] <snorti> no wont work
[05:32:50] <snorti> airdem
[05:32:55] <snorti> try it
[05:33:18] <__machine> then i need to hard code every element that has a width with another no-op class, or know all class names that define a width in advance, and i still have no way of working out if some arbitrary elements on a page have a width defined in css or not

[05:39:05] <joe_______> hey guys i have a Question: I have an Ajax.post that returns Data. now when that Data returns null i want the parent function to return; and thus stop working. Is there a way to do that?
[05:39:14] <airdem> samuelchan, http://jsfiddle.net/fHxyJ/1/
[05:39:27] <slax0r> joe_______, can you show us some code?
[05:39:28] <airdem> check the input hidden. the value is not set if you use your mouse to select an option
[05:39:37] <joe_______> yes one sec
[05:41:25] <airdem> snorti, http://jsfiddle.net/CqgYb/7/
[05:41:29] <joe_______> slax0r: http://pastebin.com/6KL8rZtd
[05:41:45] <airdem> samuelchan, see what i mean?
[05:42:24] <samuelchan> just checking it out
[05:42:59] <airdem> i need an event that fires on click on option
[05:43:13] <slax0r> joe_______, have you replaced continue with return?
[05:43:19] <airdem> or on change on input without losing focus
[05:43:29] <joe_______> yes sorry that was my stupid idea to fix it =)
[05:43:36] <joe_______> that only returns for the succes function though
[05:43:41] <joe_______> not for the "parent function"
[05:44:10] <samuelchan> airdem: does this work for you http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16027746/jquery-event-when-html5-datalist-option-is-clicked
[05:44:13] <slax0r> ah, so after ajax, there is some more code?
[05:44:17] <joe_______> slax0r: i got it =)
[05:44:21] <joe_______> yes
[05:44:33] <joe_______> basically what this does is to generate a dropdown from the database to the frontend
[05:44:45] <joe_______> if there is no data found i dont want it to generate the dropdown
[05:44:59] <slax0r> well, since ajax success is more or less a callback, it might be hard to do that
[05:45:01] <joe_______> so now i set the Array to =null; and if its null {return;}
[05:45:10] <slax0r> place the code bellow ajax into a separate function and call it from ajax success
[05:45:19] <joe_______> also a good idea
[05:45:40] <airdem> samuelchan, woah didnt knew about the input event. thanks man
[05:46:17] <joe_______> thanks for your help slax0r

[05:54:43] <dannydagger> is it possible to disable some js functions for mobile devices?
[06:10:57] <KeyboardNotFound> why first example works with ok result but second dont http://pastebin.com/sXTwF2DD ?
[06:14:23] <zChris> KeyboardNotFound. i think that it is becouse ('p') return a set of elements and the other works on a single element, but im no expert
[06:19:29] <lduros> hi I have an object literal with methods, and in one of the methods I add a callback as 'that.myCallback', in an options {} object. The issue is that then "this" inside the callback function isn't tied to the object anymore
[06:19:42] <lduros> so it says this.anotherFunction is undefined when the callback is triggered
[06:19:47] <lduros> is there a way to work around this?
[06:19:57] <lduros> I could use bind() maybe but then I don't think it would work in IE8
[06:20:50] <dcherman2> lduros: see ?proxy
[06:21:03] <dcherman2> worthless bot - http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[06:21:04] <lduros> proxy?
[06:21:05] <lduros> ok
[06:21:42] <lduros> dcherman2: so i would have to pass $.proxy(that.callback, that)?
[06:22:12] <dcherman2> lduros: looks like it, yup
[06:22:26] <lduros> ok trying
[06:23:58] <motaka2> can anyone tell me if I can write this code any better?   http://codepaste.net/gqstng ?
[06:24:23] <motaka2> can anyone tell me if I can write this code any better(according to code organazation)? http://codepaste.net/gqstng
[06:27:21] <boytoy_> At my text truncator at http://jsbin.com/okahum/39/edit -- why does it fail to unhide the other paragraphs after clicking "read more"?
[06:37:57] <Whirl3d> I never know the best way to handle this: I have a series of "sections" run sequentially in a vertical manner. Each "section" takes up the full viewport so that only one section is visible at a time.
[06:38:49] <Whirl3d> Because I am sliding the element that holds the selections, I am not sure if I should store the "current section" value or just slide the element and determine the current based on it's relative offset ?
[06:49:10] <xec_> Whirl3d: i would guess storing the current is better, in case the viewport changes size you can correct it
[06:49:22] <Raydiation> could it be that scrollHeight works differently in firefox than chromium?
[06:49:27] <Raydiation> i cant get them to return the same value
[06:50:46] <Whirl3d> xec_ thanks for the reply. I am trying something different to check it out. What if I used the "current' class to indicate the "current" section and then just animated it's parent by the top offset of the current section each time.
[06:51:14] <Whirl3d> so it would be like you said, accounting for multiple size sections if needed
[06:51:19] <Whirl3d> or changes in viewport
[06:54:46] <DeltaHeavy> Is the old version of $.ajax()'s '.always()' method the 'always: function()' ?
[06:56:02] <xec_> DeltaHeavy: try complete:
[06:57:43] <Whirl3d> I am trying to write a function that accepts a single parameter that may be undefined, boolean, or a function. How do I determine if it's a function?

[07:04:15] <Abraxsi> Hi Guys. I've written a few jQuery plugins. I'd like to know if there are any tools or guides for writing an API so people can use my widgets?
[07:04:31] <Abraxsi> jQuery UI widget factory plugins ^
[07:05:10] <Abraxsi> in fact, probably drop the word plugins. I've written a few Widgets :-)
[07:07:50] <Abraxsi> #join node.js
[07:08:19] <Abraxsi> hmm. how do i open another channel in this web irc thing...
[07:08:44] <sammich>  /join?
[07:09:07] <Abraxsi> nice one, cheers
[07:11:54] <MrS1lentcz> hello, i have a troubles with ajax. ajax method is trowing fail callback, but in browser developer console i can see, response has code 200 and valid JSON content... what can be wrong?\
[07:12:54] <iredmedia> Many things. Nobody will list them. Post code in a pastebin or gist and someone will be glad to help you out :)
[07:13:59] <sammich> well, chances are since you wrote it, you're wrong :p
[07:14:22] <BillCriswell> MrS1lentcz: Is it sending the right response headers?
[07:15:56] <MrS1lentcz> BillCriswell: headers are ok: http://pastebin.com/866cBd9Y
[07:16:06] <MrS1lentcz> line 17. is response
[07:17:00] <MrS1lentcz> BillCriswell: and json content i checked with json validator and it was ok
[07:18:29] <BillCriswell> MrS1lentcz: Can you post your exact call?
[07:18:42] <BillCriswell> $.ajax() or whatever.
[07:18:58] <MrS1lentcz> BillCriswell: i am using "$.ajax({url: myUrl}); only...
[07:19:35] <BillCriswell> .done doesn't fire?
[07:21:27] <MrS1lentcz> BillCriswell: i am so sorry, i have to go, i will be lattter, thank you for your time..
[07:21:55] <BillCriswell> Okie dokie.
[07:21:57] <xec_> he will be what?
[07:22:10] <BillCriswell> Your guess is as good as mine.
[07:22:32] <BillCriswell> He must have hit the turbo button typing "later" and forgo the here.
[07:22:42] <BillCriswell> forgot the "here".
[07:24:33] <xec_> he skipped a word and tried to make up for it with extra T's i suppose :)
[07:28:38] <mappy> how can i save the content all id 'name' and after a page refresh append them to their correct 'name'?
[07:28:46] <mappy> i have example here http://jsfiddle.net/bMmpj/
[07:29:13] * xec_ cries
[07:29:21] <BillCriswell> lol
[07:29:31] <BillCriswell> mappy: You can't use the same id more than once.
[07:29:35] <Whirl3d> If I want to ge the relative top position of an element in a sequential list of items is it better to use   el.position()["top"];   or el.css("top");
[07:30:30] <xec_> .css() will just read the css property afaik
[07:30:37] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d: el.offset().top can work.. I assume there's a positive to using this approach...
[07:30:46] <mappy> if i used different ids, how can i do it using jquery?
[07:30:46] <BillCriswell> I cant think of it right now, though.
[07:31:06] <xec_> mappy: what are you really trying to do
[07:31:15] <mappy> that is what im trying to do lol
[07:31:20] <mappy> just save the last content
[07:31:26] <mappy> into a new page refresh
[07:31:28] <xec_> save to what?
[07:31:41] <mappy> an array/variable or something
[07:31:49] <BillCriswell> mappy: You can give them all the same class and do like... var names = $('.someClassName').map(function(){ return $(this).text(); }); and save the content of names to a cookie or something. It sounds like your approach is way off and should probably talk this out with xec_ though.
[07:31:49] <mappy> it refreshes every 15 seconds
[07:32:13] <mappy> like
[07:32:39] <mappy> i did $('#name').html( $('#name').html + var );
[07:32:44] <mappy> but only saved for the first id
[07:32:56] <mappy> i tried doing loops but kinda lost with jquery lol
[07:33:09] <BillCriswell> ... What you're showing me and what you're trying to do seem unrelated.
[07:34:06] <xec_> mappy: usually, when you want something to persist through page refreshes, you save it server-side
[07:34:28] <Whirl3d> BIllCriswell, doesn't $.fn.offset() give the page position, where as $.fn.position() gives the item's relative position to it's parent?
[07:34:28] <xec_> mappy: if you really need to do it client-side (why?) you can look at cookies or localstorage
[07:34:40] <Whirl3d> ?.position
[07:34:50] <Whirl3d> I miss bot-t
[07:34:57] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d: Yes. Think that's the case.
[07:35:27] <xec_> Whirl3d: yes, that's correct
[07:37:07] <BillCriswell> mappy: http://jsfiddle.net/bMmpj/1/ would get you all the names in a comma separated list.
[07:39:23] <Mosselman> hey guys. I am making a small jquery plugin for use in my app. Within it I am binding on clicks on buttons. Inside of those event handlers 'this' will obviously reference the buttons that were clicked rather than the element that my plugin was matching to. How would you reference the plugin's matched element within a handler?
[07:39:26] <Mosselman> here is a code example:
[07:39:27] <Mosselman> http://pastie.org/8196869
[07:39:36] <BillCriswell> Never really ooked at localStorage.. seems pretty fun.
[07:40:26] <Mosselman> BillCriswell: It can be, I myself use http://amplifyjs.com/api/store/ so that I don't have to worry about some browsers that don't support localStorage
[07:40:41] <Mosselman> BillCriswell: There are too many inconstancies and plain non-support issues.
[07:41:17] <BillCriswell> seems nice
[07:41:22] <mappy> BillCriswell, this is what i was trying to do http://jsfiddle.net/bMmpj/2/ but again it doesnt work because it only gets the first #name i believe
[07:41:41] <BillCriswell> mappy: You can't use the same id more than once.
[07:41:45] <mappy> yeah i know
[07:42:05] <xec_> which begs the question, why are you still doing it?
[07:42:55] <BillCriswell> mappy: You should start over, explain your goal exactly.
[07:43:08] <mappy> well that is lol
[07:43:10] <mappy> thats all i have
[07:43:58] <mappy> like store/save all <td>, settimeout goes off, new data is shown and append the saved <td> from last refresh
[07:44:06] <xec_> mappy: $.get() is not a page refresh btw
[07:45:26] <mappy> well its getting the info from index.php
[07:45:33] <mappy> but a bad way to refresh page i guess
[07:45:46] <xec_> yes, but its NOT a page refresh, which is why you threw us off
[07:45:56] <xec_> mappy: if you want to append something, have a look at .append() instead of using .html()
[07:48:06] <jop008> any help on this?? http://pastebin.com/7SZYMeuV
[07:48:56] <BillCriswell> Mosselman: I find it hard reading coffeescript. I gave it a go thougg. Wouldn't superDuper element just be this in the plugins scope?
[07:49:22] <xec_> mappy: http://jsfiddle.net/bMmpj/3/
[07:49:58] <xec_> mappy: is something like that what you were trying to do? (using an interval instead of your $.get() for demonstration)
[07:50:02] <Mosselman> BillCriswell: sorry about that, I could render to javascript, but then it compresses things more.
[07:50:16] <mappy> yes but only for the names
[07:50:18] <BillCriswell> Mosselman: Not your fault. Different strokes for different folks haha
[07:50:20] <mappy> not the whole table
[07:50:34] <xec_> mappy: be more specific, you want to what?
[07:51:27] <mappy> i only want it to 'save' the all <td> and append it to the same <td> after it refreshs
[07:51:30] <prbc> does someone knows a good fullscreen slideshow compatible with jquery 2.x?
[07:51:30] <Mosselman> BillCriswell: As for the scope. Well the issue is that within the handler of the click I'd still like to be able to reference the SuperDuper element, even though `this` is referring to something like `#superDuper span`
[07:51:39] <Mosselman> In this example of course.
[07:52:03] <mappy> so if a name changes for the <td>, it would be like
[07:52:09] <mappy> Kevin(new name) John
[07:52:42] <xec_> mappy: what does the response from the server look like?
[07:52:54] <BillCriswell> Mosselman: You can save SuperDuper element to a variable and just use that in the callback.
[07:53:09] <mappy> its an entire html page
[07:53:14] <mappy> with a <table>
[07:53:17] <mappy> exactly the same
[07:53:20] <Mosselman> BillCriswell: the issue then is that if I have more than 1 of them the last one is always the one that ends up in the variable
[07:53:22] <mappy> as you see on that jsfiddle
[07:53:50] <xec_> mappy: and what is the goal of your application?
[07:53:52] <BillCriswell> Mosselman: You have to return this.each
[07:54:03] <xec_> mappy: are you trying to monitor for changes?
[07:54:18] <mappy> yes
[07:54:27] <xec_> allright, now we're getting somewhere :)
[07:55:10] <Mosselman> BillCriswell: I do that in the init function. But in the callback of the click I'd just want to reference 1 of the 'super dupers' namely, the one that has the span that was clicked on.
[07:55:38] <xec_> mappy: so you can start with changing from IDs to classes, right?
[07:55:48] <BillCriswell> Mosselman: Do you just want to find the closest parent .x ?
[07:55:55] <BillCriswell> s/Do/So *
[07:56:07] <xec_> mappy: then loop through the classed tds and store the names in an array. are you with me so far?
[07:56:28] <mappy> ok
[07:56:30] <Mosselman> BillCriswell: no, the span here is just an example, in reality the path and tag of the 'super duper' element could be completely different for each of the super duper elements
[07:56:32] <mappy> yes i un derstand
[07:56:39] <xec_> you know how to do this?
[07:56:44] <Mosselman> BillCriswell: I am thinking of using some sort of closure pattern
[07:56:50] <dmsuperman> How can I inspect a form's submit handlers assigned by jquery in 1.9/2.x? $._data($elem, 'events') no longer apepars to work
[07:56:58] <mappy> not really lol i dont have any jquery experience
[07:57:02] <Mosselman> BillCriswell: What I have seen as well is storing the callbacks in the $(this).data
[07:57:11] <xec_> mappy: did you see the code BillCriswell gave you earlier?
[07:57:15] <mappy> yes
[07:57:17] <mappy> still have
[07:57:30] <xec_> returned a comma separated list, because of the .join()
[07:57:44] <xec_> mappy: if you remove the .join() you got an array saved up instead
[07:58:08] <mappy> ok i understand
[07:58:29] <BillCriswell> Mosselman: I'm just not following you.
[07:59:43] <xec_> mappy: okay, and then you can do the same with the received html inside the $.get() callback
[08:00:00] <xec_> mappy: then you should have two arrays, one with the old names and one with the new, right?
[08:00:06] <Mosselman> BillCriswell: Ok lets say my match-call looks like so:  $('span, div, .someSpinner, #the_content')
[08:00:26] <BillCriswell> Mosselman: Okie dokie.
[08:00:27] <mappy> do i really need a second array? because after .get() everything will change
[08:00:52] <mappy> couldnt i just get the current html and just append the old one
[08:00:57] <Mosselman> BillCriswell: there should be a way to always have a reference to the originally matched element I think
[08:01:19] <xec_> mappy: don't do the .html() bit, don't let anything change yet. we will first compare to see if anything changed and then give notice where the changes happened
[08:01:24] <BillCriswell> Mosselman: The original collection of elements?
[08:01:59] <xec_> mappy: dont let the $.get() call update the page, i'll get to that
[08:02:03] <Mosselman> BillCriswell: no just the one that we are currently binding calls for
[08:02:14] <mappy> xec_ we don't need really need to check if a change happened
[08:02:26] <mappy> because i'm really dealing with numbers here so they will change every page refresh
[08:02:27] <BillCriswell> Mosselman: Why is that important if it's this?
[08:02:29] <Mosselman> inside each of the matched elements is a 'span' lets say, when I click that span, inside the click_handler I want to say:   $super_duper
[08:02:50] <Mosselman> BillCriswell: well it isn't `this` because `this` references the button rather than the `super_duper`
[08:02:57] <Whirl3d> will pg.siblings('.current')) return the the sibling of pg with the current class?
[08:03:20] <Mosselman> `super_duper` being one of the originally matched elements that contains the span that was just clicked :P
[08:03:35] <Whirl3d> or do I have to do pg.parents().first().find(".current")
[08:03:47] <xec_> mappy: this is why i'm asking what you're *really* trying to do - what did you mean when you said "Kevin(new name) John" - what do you really want to display
[08:04:12] <mappy> thats exactly what it to do lol
[08:04:16] <mappy> except its with numbers
[08:04:35] <xec_> so you want "43(new name) 18" ?
[08:04:39] <mappy> instead of names it'll be like
[08:04:49] <mappy> 500 30
[08:04:59] <mappy> 500 being the new number
[08:06:06] <BillCriswell> Mosselman: http://jsbin.com/ajirah/1/edit here is some code I set up a while ago to help understand plugins a bit... but notice the counters next to the text areas that are dynamically added. I put a click on them to reference the element they were "attached through" I guess. I think this is what you're going for?
[08:07:14] <Whirl3d> http://jsbin.com/ulolid/1/
[08:07:25] <prbc> does someone knows a good fullscreen slideshow compatible with jquery 2.x?
[08:08:24] <Whirl3d> Basically, I have a vertical collection of "section" elements in a vshuttle holder. Each "section has a horizontal series of "pages" in a "shuttle" holder. Using the arrows, I should be able to navigate by scrolling left and right for pages, up and down for sections.
[08:08:53] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d: That's a blank page.
[08:09:19] <Whirl3d> jsbin has been really acting up lately. Lemme login and see if it loses everything.
[08:09:41] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d: Yeah, I always get that red "work not saved" message.
[08:09:47] <Mosselman> BillCriswell: yeah thats the pattern I meant with attaching the class to the data attribute of the matched element.
[08:10:03] <Mosselman> BillCriswell: so that is an answer to my question :) thanks
[08:10:09] <BillCriswell> Mosselman: Sweet.
[08:10:25] <BillCriswell> Mosselman: To be honest, sometimes programming talk confuses me.
[08:10:34] <BillCriswell> Even though I can kind of do it.
[08:10:44] <Mosselman> BillCriswell: I had seen the pattern described by Addy Osmani in his book (online) but wondered if there was another way. But this looks pretty legit.
[08:14:29] <xec_> mappy: http://jsfiddle.net/bMmpj/4/
[08:15:18] <mappy> yeah this is exactly
[08:15:26] <xec_> mappy: do you understand all this code?
[08:15:41] <mappy> a little
[08:15:50] <mappy> i see you are looping to get all the .names
[08:15:56] <mappy> from htmlReturned variable
[08:16:43] <mappy> i understand it mostly just didnt know how to do with jquery
[08:16:44] <xec_> yes. passing a html string straight into the $() function will create a DOM tree that is not part of the page
[08:17:17] <xec_> mappy: the code I wrote *is* jquery... what do you mean?
[08:17:49] <mappy> no i meant like i understand it lol i wouldnt be able to do it because i dont have enough exp with jquery
[08:18:33] <mappy> i have a question tho
[08:18:35] <mappy> for the page refresh
[08:18:44] <mappy> what hsould i use if not .get()
[08:19:15] <Whirl3d> http://jsbin.com/ideraq/1/
[08:19:22] <okt1> Can I push an array into an array?
[08:19:28] <Whirl3d> sorry it's so ugly.
[08:19:53] <okt1> Or should I refactor and be pushing an object into an array?
[08:20:12] <xec_> mappy: you are not doing a page refresh, stop saying that ;) $.get() is one of the ways to do ajax requests, which is fine
[08:20:27] * Whirl3d consults my magic ball to see what the situation is for okt1...
[08:20:27] <mappy> ok
[08:20:48] <xec_> mappy: it lets you fetch server data *without a page refresh* which is why i want you not to confuse the terms ;)
[08:21:44] <xec_> okt1: depending on what your goal is, arrays in arrays can be completely viable
[08:22:40] <boytoy_> Hello lovers! =)
[08:22:50] <xec_> okt1: we would need more details to make any sort of proper recommendation ;)
[08:23:17] <xec_> s/proper recommendation/wild guess
[08:23:20] <okt1> I'm sending a POST request to the PHP script, I have a form with all kinds of potential data, checkboxes, radios, inputs, just wanting a way to only send the data that is filled out. So I was filling a data array with the data and sending it using an AJAX call.
[08:24:06] <boytoy_> At this text truncator: http://jsbin.com/okahum/39/edit -- why won't it unhide the other paragraphs when clicking "read more"?
[08:24:09] <boytoy_> $(this).closest('.articles').find('p').not(':first').show(); didn't seem to do the trick.
[08:24:18] <Whirl3d> JSON?
[08:24:42] <boytoy_> Whirl3d: me?
[08:24:54] <Whirl3d> no, sorry, looking now
[08:25:13] <boytoy_> That would be so cool man
[08:26:31] <okt1> If I send it as JSON, I'd have to decode it on the PHP side? Does JSON data get encoded as a part of the POST request?
[08:26:33] <Whirl3d> I dont think you click handler is setup right
[08:27:00] <Whirl3d> First, you don't want to setup click handlers on the entire document.
[08:27:39] <DeltaHeavy> okt1: Nope, in PHP you need to do something like    $descriptiveVariable = json_decode($_POST['yourJSON']);
[08:27:39] <boytoy_> Whirl3d: What should I do instead? Yeah I always was a bit skeptical to that part
[08:27:58] <Whirl3d> Second, you have setup the selector for the click event handler to select only the single #readmore element...or perhaps you have several #readmore's which is a problem. (# selects by id)
[08:28:29] <boytoy_> Whirl3d: Cool, yeah there should be 3 readmores
[08:28:32] <Whirl3d> change the "#readmore' to ".readmore' and use $("article").on('click", ".readmore")....
[08:28:51] <Whirl3d> make sure your readmores are classed not id=readmore...
[08:29:06] <boytoy_> marvellous one sec
[08:30:15] <boytoy_> Whirl3d: oooooh oh oh oh :)
[08:30:16] <okt1> DeltaHeavy: So I'd just construct an object on the client side and return that object as the value for the data: key of the ajax request? How do you define the yourJSON reference?
[08:30:53] <boytoy_> Whirl3d: i think that did the trick man =)
[08:30:57] <DeltaHeavy> okt: yourJSON is just the key you gave your JSON value in your 'data' object assuming you're using $.ajax()
[08:31:31] <Whirl3d> wait. Found a couple of other issues. Gimme just a minute
[08:32:44] <boytoy_> Whirl3d: nice
[08:32:59] <boytoy_> Whirl3d: too bad the examples at http://jrvis.com/trunk8/ don't work with the latest jquery :/
[08:33:46] <Whirl3d> boytoy_, is there any reason you aren't using the <article> element?
[08:34:10] <boytoy_> Whirl3d: no reason feel free to change
[08:36:23] <xec_> boytoy_: i'll tell you what's wrong for $1 and a high five
[08:36:32] <xec_> actually, forget the dollar
[08:37:15] <xec_> your <a> is removed by the "revert" method, which invalidates the element, so you can't do $(this).closest() after the fact because "this" doesnt exist anymore
[08:37:19] <boytoy_> xec_: ill give you a high five np
[08:37:49] <xec_> boytoy_: just move the "revert" after the .closest() line, and you're golden
[08:38:10] <boytoy_> xec_: wow what a catch ;p
[08:38:19] * boytoy_ showers xec_ with high fives
[08:38:20] <xec_> of course, Whirl3d does have a point regarding the ID should be unique
[08:38:22] <okt1> DeltaHeavy: Thanks, right track now!
[08:38:32] <boytoy_> yup
[08:38:49] <Whirl3d> boytoy_ do they add a class to the truncated paragraph to make it easy to select?
[08:38:53] * xec_ high fives everyone before he goes home
[08:39:12] <DeltaHeavy> ok1: No problem. And as a tip, check your JS is working 100% first. I always just make my php file 'exit (print_r($_REQUEST));' and try with a bunch of inputs depending on what I'm doing.
[08:39:25] <DeltaHeavy> That way you don't make things more complicated while you still may have an issue you're overlooking.
[08:39:51] <okt1> DeltaHeavy: Very much my workflow. :)
[08:40:18] <boytoy_> Whirl3d: not that i know of
[08:40:41] <boytoy_> xec_: later dawg
[08:40:54] <DeltaHeavy> NIce, all this "test drive development" stuff is honestly such utter garbage. Incremental devving is the way to go.
[08:40:57] * boytoy_ locks the revision at http://jsbin.com/okahum/45/edit
[08:43:10] <shoky> boytoy_: you're adding a click handler to $(document)  for each article. take that outside of the loop
[08:43:42] <jop008> any good carousel touch slider with images working 2gether with jquery mobile?
[08:44:04] <boytoy_> shoky: cheers man =D
[08:44:17] <Whirl3d> boytoy, I have a typo somewhere....I think. It's not finding the article elements.
[08:44:50] <shoky> boytoy_: also your $(window).resize  isn't doing anything. this === window  inside
[08:45:10] <boytoy_> oooh
[08:45:16] <boytoy_> shoky: lemme take that one out as well
[08:45:32] <shoky> it still won't do anything if you take it out
[08:45:37] <boytoy_> yeah :/
[08:51:52] <boytoy_> shoky: isnt the resizable function enough anyway?
[08:52:10] <shoky> boytoy_: no idea what you're doing with that resizable stuff
[08:52:58] <shoky> nor do i know what .trunk8()  does
[08:54:01] <okt1> If I wanted a combined selection of $("input[type='text']") , $("input[type='textarea']") , $("input[type='select']") how do I string these together?
[08:54:05] <Whirl3d> http://jsbin.com/okahum/46/
[08:54:07] <boytoy_> shoky: basically it's "smart truncation". that resizable / window resize stuff is from the bottom of http://jrvis.com/trunk8/ which should handle responsive truncation..
[08:54:45] <boytoy_> but yeah it doesnt work anymore.. im trying to fix now though
[08:55:11] <shoky> boytoy_: but.. do you want these paragraphs to actually be resizable?
[08:55:21] <Whirl3d> boytoy_ can't you just reinitialize on resize?
[08:55:22] <shoky> as in, the user can drag and resize them..
[08:55:40] <boytoy_> shoky: hmmm.. actually no..
[08:55:41] <Ansikt> okt1 $("input[type='text'], input[type='textarea'], input[type='select'], ")
[08:55:50] <boytoy_> Whirl3d: yeah I think that's the way to go!
[08:55:56] * boytoy_ removes jquery ui resizable
[08:55:57] <okt1> Ansikt: simple enough... thanks...
[08:56:12] <Whirl3d> http://jsbin.com/okahum/46/
[08:56:18] <Ansikt> that being said, the attribute selector is pretty inefficient, and if it's possible for you to use a class for this, I'd recommend it.
[08:57:14] <boytoy_> shoky: you mentioned this === window  inside, could you elaborate on that please?
[08:57:37] <shoky> boytoy_:  $(window).resize(function() {  console.log(this === window)  })
[08:57:43] <shoky> will log true
[08:58:06] <okt1> Ansikt: So I'd be better off listing a class for each of the inputs all in the markup? Is it really that big of a hit?
[08:58:23] <shoky> but you were doing $('p:first', this)   which is $(window).find('p:first')    window is not an element, you can't query it like that
[08:58:58] <dabear> okt1: $("input").filter( function(){  return ["textarea","select", "text"].indexOf(this.type)+1  })
[08:59:08] <dabear> faster:p
[09:00:20] <boytoy_> shoky: Aha, yeah that makes sense
[09:00:37] <boytoy_> Whirl3d: is that why you asked if trunk8 adds a class to truncated p's?
[09:00:44] <Ansikt> okt1: Depends on how often you need to do the selection, I suppose.  Class names can be optimized to use getElementsByClassName, which is a bit of a loss.
[09:01:18] <Ansikt> dabear:  Is that really faster than the way sizzle does it?
[09:01:22] <Whirl3d> I can't remember. That was minutes ago. You thik I have an attentionspan that long. LOL
[09:01:40] <dabear> Ansikt: time it
[09:01:56] <Ansikt> dabear: good idea.
[09:03:15] <boytoy_> :)
[09:05:24] <shoky> boytoy_: why are you doing all that stuff with hiding the <p>s anyway
[09:05:31] <shoky> isn't that what the plugin is for
[09:06:15] <boytoy_> shoky: nope it only seems to truncate one p at a time, not a bunch of them
[09:06:33] <shoky> boytoy_: of course it'll only truncate a <p> if you run it on a <p>
[09:06:39] <shoky> boytoy_: http://jsbin.com/okahum/50/edit
[09:06:46] <boytoy_> shoky: i think i see what you mean by that window querying thing you mentioned..
[09:06:55] <boytoy_> ooh whats that!!
[09:07:41] <boytoy_> oh my oh my :D
[09:08:14] <Ansikt> dabear: You're right.  It is faster, like 1/3 faster.
[09:08:21] <dabear> http://jsperf.com/jquery-test-sizzle-vs-filter
[09:08:23] <dabear> yep
[09:08:35] <Ansikt> Based on my unscientific test on some random stack overflow page
[09:08:45] <boytoy_> thats absolutely gorgeous shoky beautiful
[09:08:55] <Ansikt> var i=0;var startTime = new Date().getTime(); while (i < 2000){jQuery("input").filter( function(){return["textarea","select", "text"].indexOf(this.type)+1});i++;} console.log(((new Date().getTime() - startTime)/1000) + ' seconds');
[09:09:02] <Ansikt> vs
[09:09:02] <Ansikt> var i=0;var startTime = new Date().getTime(); while (i < 2000){jQuery('input[type="textarea"], input[type="select"], input[type="text"]');i++;} console.log(((new Date().getTime() - startTime)/1000) + ' seconds');
[09:09:06] <dabear> jsperf is better
[09:10:21] <Ansikt> eh, either way it gave me what I wanted.  Ran it on this page:
[09:10:23] <Ansikt> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10524315/how-to-invoke-formhandler-thru-ajax-directly
[09:10:31] <Ansikt> on chrome
[09:11:06] <J18dk> Can anyone help me why following don't work -> http://9l.dk/nfolder/ - Can't figure it out :/
[09:13:40] <J18dk> Can'
[09:15:15] <Ansikt> j18dk: picker has a dependency on jQuery UI, if I'm reading this right.
[09:16:08] <DeltaHeavy> J18dk: Regardless if you get the help or not, I ain't trying to bitch at ya but you'll get far better results from people trying to help you if you clearly lay out what your problem is and pastebin relevant code, preferably in a single message :p
[09:17:28] <J18dk> Gives good sense, oh, trying to find a timeDate pivcker to use with that versions :\
[09:18:38] <dabear> Ansikt: manual filtering will always be faster, as you don't have to do as much work as sizzle does ( sizzle needs to handle more edge cases, and sizzle code is larger than my filtering..)
[09:19:06] <naeluh> yo!
[09:51:40] <aMoniker> Is there a way to add snap-to-grid while in the middle of dragging a draggable?
[09:51:58] <aMoniker> I'd like for an element to drag normally until it's over another element, then it should start snapping to a grid
[09:59:44] <jop008> is there a way to detect with .slde() the oritentaion of the swipe?
[09:59:52] <jop008> is  it thru right or to left?
[10:01:46] <dougb> There is a bug with using mouseenter/mouseleave on Opera when you have one window (window A) partially on top of the window with the jQuery mouseenter/mouseleave code (window B) and you move your mouse from window B to window A, window B still thinks your mouse is on the window
[10:02:10] <aMoniker> dougb: Opera is bad.
[10:02:14] <dougb> I've made a little jsfildde here to test: http://jsfiddle.net/TuU4M/embedded/result/ this doesn't happen in any other browser...has anyone run into this before?
[10:02:54] <dougb> aMoniker: I agree...i need to see if somehow there's a way to figure out how to fix this
[10:03:06] <aMoniker> dougb: don't support opera
[10:03:17] <aMoniker> how many of your users run it?
[10:03:25] <zmode> hi. i'm trying to chain a couple of POST requests with ".then()", but i get this "postRows(...).then is not a function" error. here's the relevant code http://sprunge.us/WfBU
[10:03:57] <dougb> aMoniker: users are going to use opera regardless, and part of the process requires they're on the page so i'm seeing if they've moved there mouse off the window
[10:04:47] <aMoniker> dougb: what's the browser share for opera for your app?
[10:05:16] <dougb> it's low, around 16k of the 3.1 mil in the past month
[10:07:42] <naeluh> hey all I am having an issue getting this to work I am trying to get the value of the datepicker and format it but wont do it http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/UbMve/
[10:08:05] <aMoniker> dougb: man, we stopped supporting opera at 1%... you're at 0.5%
[10:08:26] <naeluh> for some reason the <div id='date'></div> just stays the same ?????\
[10:09:16] <dougb> aMoniker: i know, the thing is the end user gets 'rewarded' for engaging, so it just bugs me that there is a workaround with Opera and with no other browser
[10:09:38] <dougb> I'll file a bug for Opera and see what happens
[10:10:23] <naeluh> its weird cause I had it workign yesterday
[10:11:50] <aMoniker> dougb: good luck
[10:13:05] <naeluh> weird right ?
[10:14:15] <sainaen> naeluh, first of all, you can't have two elements on the page with the same id.
[10:14:53] <naeluh> sainaen: interesting .. ok let me see
[10:14:53] <naeluh> thanks
[10:15:56] <aMoniker> sainaen: you can, but it confuses things
[10:16:09] <naeluh> yeah that didnt change anything
[10:16:15] <duch_kazatel> aMoniker it's not valid HTML.
[10:16:26] <aMoniker> duch_kazatel: sure, but all browsers will render it
[10:17:17] <duch_kazatel> yes, because they're forgiving.  they'll then try to interpret wtf your styles and js then mean, leading to inconsistent results.
[10:17:29] <naeluh> yeah its weird the variable is getting passed to the alert but not to the var ds = ...
[10:17:31] <sainaen> aMoniker, well, you *can* do anything you want and browser will try to deal with it, but id should be unique: http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-html5-20121025/global-attributes.html#the-id-attribute
[10:17:52] <aMoniker> sainaen: oh, I know the spec, I'm just saying you can do it if you so choose.
[10:17:58] <naeluh> I swear to god I had this workign yestreday
[10:18:06] <aMoniker> styling will work, but js usually has trouble with multiple ids
[10:18:08] <duch_kazatel> you never should "choose" to do it is what i'm saying.
[10:18:28] <aMoniker> duch_kazatel: you should never eat sugar
[10:18:36] <duch_kazatel> *sigh*
[10:18:44] <aMoniker> duch_kazatel: start running, fatty!
[10:18:50] <naeluh> I dont each sugart
[10:19:02] <naeluh> sugar
[10:19:20] <naeluh> hey but so is there any reason why I cant get that .val
[10:20:03] <sainaen> naeluh, do you want to write something like that: http://jsfiddle.net/UbMve/1/ ?
[10:23:25] <sunbeam> I would like to add a link to a page, when that link is clicked I want google to translate the page to the language i define in the onclick
[10:23:32] <sunbeam> any idea how i can best do this?
[10:23:34] <naeluh> wow so all I had to was add that function jesus I fell like an idiot
[10:25:56] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam i'd dig around and look for what sort of URL the translate for websites setup is looking for, then dynamically craft away.
[10:27:11] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: i tried but can't really find
[10:27:49] <duch_kazatel> do the links go to pages you control?
[10:28:13] <sunbeam> how do yo umean?
[10:29:13] <duch_kazatel> do you own the pages you're linking users to?
[10:29:23] <duch_kazatel> could you maybe integrate google translate for websites?
[10:30:49] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: i do  yes
[10:31:00] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: its just simply on my website
[10:31:11] <duch_kazatel> http://translate.google.com/manager/website/?hl=en
[10:32:13] <sunbeam> i dont want google to do it
[10:32:16] <sunbeam> i want to do all with javascript
[10:32:22] <sunbeam> so that the link im on doesnt change
[10:32:28] <duch_kazatel> aaaah
[10:34:28] <sunbeam> that should be possible aswell with google translate
[10:37:11] <sunbeam> Google Translate API is no longer free.
[10:37:11] <sunbeam> wth
[10:41:13] <naeluh> in jquery ui is it possible to onSelect and onClose ?
[11:33:33] <Whirl3d> Okay, I am defining a click handler method that I apply to some buttons with ".on('click",clickHandler); and the last part of clickHandler checks to see if the buttons should be disabled or not by calling "check Buttons"
[11:34:16] <Whirl3d> nvm, I got it I think.
[11:50:00] <ernston> hey
[11:50:19] <duch_kazatel> hello
[11:50:35] <ernston> i am trying to change a href with jquery
[11:50:45] <ernston> it doesnt appear to be working as expected though:
[11:50:51] <ernston> $(".gallery li a").attr("href", 'img/shops/'+json.shops[currentItem].shopImg +'.jpg').appendTo("href");
[11:51:20] <duch_kazatel> what's the deal with the "appendTo" in there?
[11:51:29] <naeluh> ahhh!
[11:51:39] <ernston> i guess thats the problem
[11:52:11] <ernston> damn still cant find the image
[11:59:30] <naeluh> hey anyone see why in here http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/wheqK/ when I click continue I get a Uncaught ReferenceError: checkRequired is not defined  its weird because when I dont use jsfiddle it works ?
[12:02:12] <BillCriswell> naeluh: You don't have checkRequired defined.
[12:03:09] <naeluh> BillCriswell: ok I guess maybe  I am doing something different in the other files
[12:03:30] <BillCriswell> naeluh: Yes.
[12:04:02] <BillCriswell> You need to look for something like var checkRequired = function(){..} or function checkRequired(){...}
[12:05:07] <naeluh> found it
[12:05:19] <naeluh> it was defined in another file
[12:05:26] <naeluh> thanks BillCriswell
[12:05:29] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[12:07:08] <ernston> how could i count the number of images with a certain string in it?
[12:07:15] <feens> is there a clean way to access a controller's resource/factory object (specifically the url) from a directive?
[12:08:52] <feens> shoot…wrong room
[12:13:26] <BillCriswell> ernston: You can use filter.
[12:13:57] <BillCriswell> Or just $('img[src*=substring]').length actually
[12:17:03] <Whirl3d> Total mind melt for a second...var theClass='.someClass'; var theCollection=$(theClass);  error?
[12:17:27] <ernston> that will allow me to counter the number of .jpgs  that start with   today_
[12:19:21] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d: Nothing jumping out at me.
[12:20:07] <BillCriswell> ernston: Are paths in the src?
[12:26:31] <BillCriswell> ernston: Did you reply? I was disconnected for some weird reason.
[12:26:47] <BillCriswell> ernston: http://jsbin.com/ufodoy/1/edit can do what you want I believe.
[12:27:35] <BillCriswell> However, if you just have src="today_whatver.jpg" you can do $('img[src^=today][src$=jpg]').length
[12:30:01] <sunbeam> I would like to add a link to a page, when that link is clicked I want google to translate the page to the language i define in the onclick
[12:30:09] <sunbeam> I want to have this done with jquery only, not php or link change etc
[12:30:19] <sunbeam> so that the page link won't change to an external domain
[12:32:04] <BillCriswell> So you just want the result of this page basically? http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=auto&tl=ar&u=http%3A%2F%2Fbackbonejs.org%2F
[12:33:50] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: correct, but without the frame on top
[12:33:56] <e563e57> Hi, can anyone recomend a book on how to solve this type of problems, in my app (web app) i have 50 items, and each item takes around 500ms to retrieve from server (excluding http time). Is it a good idea to make 50 HTTP requests? or shall i split up the data etc
[12:34:03] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: and without going to an external domain
[12:34:38] <BillCriswell> They have a translate API, but it's not free.
[12:34:57] <BillCriswell> https://developers.google.com/translate/
[12:35:23] <sunbeam> I read that yea
[12:35:24] <sunbeam> how come?
[12:35:40] <sunbeam> I don't feel like paying any of this
[12:36:17] <blindMoe> $20 for 1Million characters translated doesn't seem like a hard price to pay
[12:36:27] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: It's a valuable service.
[12:36:47] <NoiseEee> "I don't feel like paying any of this" said everyone in generation Y
[12:36:53] <blindMoe> hehe
[12:37:03] <sunbeam> generation Y :D ?
[12:37:35] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: http://www.microsoft.com/web/post/using-the-free-bing-translation-apis maybe
[12:37:58] <BillCriswell> That post is terrible
[12:38:03] <BillCriswell> but it says it's free.
[12:38:07] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: haha.
[12:38:29] <BillCriswell> Oh shit I'm generation Y. =(
[12:38:38] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: i think i use bing yea
[12:38:50] <NoiseEee> generation lost
[12:38:51] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: Then get crackin. =D
[12:39:14] <blindMoe> BillCriswell: I think I am on the custp of X / Y so I am pretty sure I get the worst of both sides
[12:39:17] <e563e57> Noone know of such a book?
[12:39:17] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: I never looked this up before... but it seems I am both X and Y
[12:39:25] <BillCriswell> blindMoe: Haha same here.
[12:39:28] <BillCriswell> Early 80s
[12:39:31] <blindMoe> yeah I am 80
[12:39:32] <ernston> thx
[12:39:40] <BillCriswell> ernston: Welcome!
[12:39:46] <NoiseEee> well you should both/all read Generation X
[12:39:59] <ernston> had to get shower am melting
[12:40:00] <BillCriswell> Generation X just sounds cooler. I'm calling myself that.
[12:40:09] <blindMoe> NoiseEee: I don't want to know anything more about my generation
[12:40:09] <BillCriswell> ernston: Programming does that to a man.
[12:40:30] <naeluh> whia
[12:40:32] <naeluh> whoa
[12:40:32] <BillCriswell> Was there a generation W?
[12:40:45] <naeluh> gen a
[12:40:55] <naeluh> sumeria
[12:41:12] <ernston> BillCriswell am using json
[12:41:20] <ernston> am not setting each img attr
[12:41:29] <ernston> i want jquery to do that for me
[12:41:43] <BillCriswell> ernston: If you have the JSON just filter out the images before you add them?
[12:41:56] <ernston> ok you lost me
[12:41:59] <sunbeam> Aren't there any other good page translation plugins?
[12:42:00] <NoiseEee> e563e57: assuming you're saying "i have 50 items to get via XHR/ajax",  a much better approach would be to have all those 50 items in an object on page load to lookup/query on demand instead of via XHR.
[12:42:06] <sunbeam> That are free
[12:42:14] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: Google
[12:42:19] <BillCriswell> Google it*
[12:42:26] <sunbeam> I can't barely find any
[12:42:33] <ernston> am trying to count the amount in the folder then generate the list
[12:42:40] <ernston> based on the amount found
[12:42:44] <BillCriswell> ernston: You can loop through the json object and get the number of images instead of adding them to the DOM and then counting them.
[12:43:06] <ernston> i have set 1 value in the json data as shopImg
[12:43:10] <ernston> thats a prefix
[12:43:25] <ernston> eg: testshop_1.jpg
[12:43:45] <ernston> btw this is for a mobile web app
[12:43:54] <sunbeam> http://jquery.bunkerhill.com/
[12:43:57] <ernston> doesnt require a connection though
[12:43:58] <sunbeam> This looks pretty good BillCriswell
[12:43:58] <BillCriswell> ernston: Just go for it.
[12:43:58] <e_876rfh> NoiseEee, thanks for the reply
[12:44:12] <sunbeam> however, I think bing will eventually also charge for their service
[12:44:24] <e_876rfh> But if each item takes 500ms to load, so 500ms x 50, thats a lot to wait for a user
[12:44:31] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: Exactly.
[12:44:47] <NoiseEee> e_876rfh: "to load" from where?
[12:44:55] <NoiseEee> e_876rfh: you mean via ajax?
[12:44:59] <e_876rfh> yes sir
[12:45:00] <maxmoore14> this is pretty basic, but not sure what I am missing: http://jsbin.com/evuyuy/1/edit
[12:45:18] <e_876rfh> The items is on a server
[12:45:27] <maxmoore14> I think I can't call each() the way I have it written
[12:45:30] <e_876rfh> For example, how does Instagram and such apps solve this type of problems?
[12:45:32] <maxmoore14> any suggestions?
[12:45:46] <e_876rfh> Id like to read a book that discuss this type of problems
[12:45:52] <e_876rfh> if it exists
[12:45:56] <blindMoe> e_876rfh: with massive caching and nice loading screens ;)
[12:45:57] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: http://jquery.bunkerhill.com/
[12:46:01] <sunbeam> Do you know wth they do here?
[12:46:05] <sunbeam> I mean the text is not selectable
[12:46:25] <e_876rfh> blindMoe, you mean caching-on-server?
[12:46:34] <BillCriswell> maxmoore14: Think you want $.each( $.extend({}, obj1, obj2), function(){ ... });
[12:46:39] <e_876rfh> But do you know any text, ebook, book or whatever that discuss this type of things
[12:46:45] <e_876rfh> Because I need this type of stuff to my app
[12:47:31] <NoiseEee> e_876rfh: what i'm saying is, junk ajax entirely, put the object in your document at page load
[12:47:43] <BillCriswell> maxmoore14: I may  be wrong. Nevermind.
[12:47:56] <maxmoore14> BillCriswell: yeah, that didn't work either
[12:47:58] <NoiseEee> e_876rfh: var thingToQuery = { item1:'stuff about item 1',item2:'stuff about item 2'}
[12:48:13] <e_876rfh> But those things are not static
[12:48:24] <e_876rfh> Its dynamic content from the server NoiseEee
[12:48:50] <NoiseEee> e_876rfh: why are you concerned about 50 instead of 1?
[12:49:02] <e_876rfh> Its like this, simplified, each item has a name and a value, the name is fast to get, but lets say the value takes 1 second to calculate server-side
[12:49:02] <maxmoore14> BillCriswell: got another stab at it?
[12:49:19] <e_876rfh> And in my application, I need to show those 50 items in a list
[12:49:28] <e_876rfh> user clicks it, and user sees the value
[12:49:33] <BillCriswell> maxmoore14: http://jsbin.com/evuyuy/2/edit Shooting for this?
[12:49:45] <e_876rfh> now, shall I retrive the names, show them, and then start fetching the values
[12:49:46] <e_876rfh> OR
[12:50:00] <e_876rfh> shall i load one item one-by-one and fill the list as they are downloaded
[12:50:10] <NoiseEee> e_876rfh: i'm not getting the issue. why don't you return all 50 at once then?
[12:50:18] <NoiseEee> e_876rfh: why would you get one at a time?
[12:50:19] <e_876rfh> because then the user would wait 50 seconds
[12:50:37] <NoiseEee> e_876rfh: one XHR request returning 50 items / keys in the object / etc
[12:51:01] <e_876rfh> yes but on the server, which outputs the data
[12:51:06] <maxmoore14> BillCriswell: yeah, that's pretty good, thanks
[12:51:11] <e_876rfh> it takes 1 second to calculate each one of these values
[12:51:19] <BillCriswell> maxmoore14: I think the issue is using this in your code?  You need to pass like..function( key, value ).
[12:51:26] <e_876rfh> SO if I return them all at once, i would need to wait 50 sec, and then retreive a list of all of them
[12:51:28] <e_876rfh> got it?
[12:52:04] <NoiseEee> e_876rfh: hmm i suppose, the red flag for me is that I can't think of many things that take 1 second to calculate in 2013 offhand
[12:52:21] <NoiseEee> e_876rfh: perhaps you should look into DB optimization / profiling whats happening on the server?
[12:52:37] <e_876rfh> that is also true, but its quite large db scripts that are being runned
[12:52:52] <iredmedia> NoiseEee: is correct.
[12:53:03] <NoiseEee> e_876rfh: even so, i bet there's a bunch of optization you can do on that SQL side.
[12:53:16] <e_876rfh> yes but unfourtanly I cant do that
[12:53:18] <e_876rfh> but
[12:53:29] <e_876rfh> lets say I could to that
[12:53:37] <e_876rfh> WOuld you still return them all at once?
[12:53:43] <maxmoore14> BillCriswell: do you have a link to the docs for that function?
[12:54:01] <maxmoore14> I only see http://api.jquery.com/each/
[12:54:01] <BillCriswell> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[12:54:54] <maxmoore14> oh, wait, nevermind, I see
[12:55:04] <NoiseEee> e_876rfh: not sure really. assuming that was fixed and each query took a lot less, probably... otherwise one-at-a-time, but whats the point of that if the user has to wait for each thing regardless?  just a UI update / showing that things are happening?
[12:55:31] <e_876rfh> yeah
[12:55:46] <e_876rfh> But one at the time is 50 separate HTTP requests
[12:55:53] <e_876rfh> Isnt that a bad praxis generally?
[12:55:56] <iredmedia> Yes
[12:55:58] <NoiseEee> e_876rfh: yes
[12:56:21] <NoiseEee> e_876rfh: are all 50 calculations really that dynamic you couldn't preload them?
[12:56:35] <NoiseEee> e_876rfh: otherwise return 50 items via a single xhr query
[12:56:47] <e_876rfh> i cannot unfourtanly handle the database
[12:57:06] <e_876rfh> another developer is in charge of that
[12:57:14] <NoiseEee> tell him/her to do her job :)
[12:57:18] <e_876rfh> haha
[12:57:20] <NoiseEee> profile profile profile
[12:57:43] <e_876rfh> but for example, again, the instagram app
[12:57:49] <e_876rfh> in their "Explore" subpage
[12:57:56] <NoiseEee> e_876rfh: but your best answer is 50 items in one XHR query, and a ncie little 'loading' animation to keep the user occupied, ostensibly with a note right now that says "this might take a while! hang in there"
[12:57:57] <e_876rfh> one images at once appear
[12:57:59] <iredmedia> Lazy loading?
[12:58:11] <e_876rfh> How do they do that?
[12:58:12] <iredmedia> Lazy loading is different then sequentially loading 50 items
[12:58:24] <iredmedia> Everytime you need more images, they load another "page" or set
[12:58:24] <e_876rfh> Is instagram using lazy loading?
[12:58:41] <iredmedia> e_876rfh: yes. Lazy loading just means loading things on a 'need to know' basis
[12:58:50] <NoiseEee> e_876rfh: yeah thats what it does.  doesn't load items until they're scrolled into viewport / just before theyr'e in viewpot
[12:58:54] <iredmedia> Like, "i've scrolled to the bottom of the page, give me more"
[12:58:56] <NoiseEee> s/spelling errors/corrections
[12:58:59] <e_876rfh> yeah thats great
[12:59:17] <e_876rfh> Id like to read more about those techniques, and with javascript
[12:59:22] <e_876rfh> thats why I asked about some book or so
[12:59:30] <NoiseEee> good books are hard to come by.
[12:59:32] <e_876rfh> but you guys dont know any off hand?
[12:59:40] <e_876rfh> I learnt backboneJS which I will use
[12:59:56] <NoiseEee> javascript in general i'd try http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[13:00:24] <NoiseEee> as far as best practices in web development, not sure if i know of one.  john resigs "javscript ninja" is really good too, if you can get past the title
[13:00:33] <NoiseEee> best practices often change, irc is a good resource ;)
[13:00:37] <e_876rfh> true
[13:00:47] <e_876rfh> I took some inspiration from instagram as u probably understood
[13:00:50] <e_876rfh> because they have a lot of data
[13:00:58] <e_876rfh> and even if i dont use their app much
[13:01:02] <e_876rfh> I think they have a really amazing app
[13:01:08] <NoiseEee> yes but its loaded as needed / on demand, which sounds a bit different than your goal
[13:01:09] <e_876rfh> its really responsive and fast
[13:01:17] <e_876rfh> Is it realy on demand?
[13:01:40] <NoiseEee> yeah, why load all 500 images in a persons library if they can only see 10 at a time... that kidn of thing
[13:01:49] <e_876rfh> ye
[13:02:17] <maxmoore14> thanks BillCriswell
[13:02:22] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[13:02:36] <NoiseEee> and if you're interested in app speed / perception, http://addyosmani.com/blog/gone-in-sixty-frames-per-second/ is a good read
[13:02:55] <NoiseEee> sorry actual link is http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/06/10/pinterest-paint-performance-case-study/
[13:07:34] <astropirate> Anyone know of a web store that sells jquery Ui themes?
[13:08:08] <NoiseEee> cant you roll your own themes based off of existing ones or something astropirate?  of all the places to spend money...
[13:08:34] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to skin?  a wordpress install?
[13:34:15] <astropirate> duch_kazatel, no creating an application with lots of UI widgets and such
[13:34:27] <astropirate> UI tingy magingies
[14:04:48] <dwarder> why does it return false? http://jsfiddle.net/mPaqa/
[14:06:44] <dabear> dwarder: http://regexpal.com/
[14:06:46] <dabear> use it
[14:07:25] <dwarder> i forget about one space
[14:07:28] <duch_kazatel> or http://www.debuggex.com/?re=&str=
[14:16:42] <timbozeman> how could i run       history.pushState({}, null, '/page2');        with a jquery .once()? i r confused
[14:17:30] <dwarder> how event is called on which you paste a text or click on tooltip with the text you entered before that is provided by your browser
[14:18:05] <dwarder> into input field
[14:19:04] <dwarder> is it 'paste'?
[14:19:44] <dwarder> in .on() can i enter two events?
[14:19:52] <dwarder> on which it fires up?
[14:23:03] <duch_kazatel> you mean can you bind two seperate events?
[14:23:11] <dwarder> i.e. $('#bla').on({'keypress','paste'}
[14:23:12] <duch_kazatel> *to two seperate events
[14:23:34] <dwarder> i want the same code run
[14:23:39] <dwarder> on this two events
[14:24:41] <duch_kazatel> the docs are here: http://api.jquery.com/on/ - they say this for the events: "One or more space-separated event types and optional namespaces, such as "click" or "keydown.myPlugin"."
[14:25:31] <dwarder> so it is:
[14:25:50] <dwarder> i.e. $('#bla').on('keypress paste'
[14:25:56] <dwarder> right?
[14:26:16] <duch_kazatel> did you try?
[14:26:27] <dwarder> one moment
[14:27:36] <duch_kazatel> $(selector).on('mouseenter click', function(){}) will work.
[14:27:53] <dwarder> dabear: doesn't work with the browser tooltip
[14:28:31] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: is it a 'paste' event?
[14:29:05] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to bind an event to when somebody pastes something?
[14:29:31] <duch_kazatel> like, via their keyboard?
[14:29:38] <Forbidd3n>  Is it better to put disabled on each element or use jquery to apply disabled to all elements in the form?
[14:29:47] <Forbidd3n> I want to disable the entire form
[14:29:56] <sunbeam> Does anyone know a good free jQuery / Javascript based translation tool?
[14:30:11] <duch_kazatel> Forbidd3n - if the user doesn't have javascript, what happens with the second method?
[14:30:31] <Forbidd3n> so I would say put it on each element
[14:30:57] <duch_kazatel> that's generally the safer method - if the "default state" is to have it all disabled, the markup should probably reflect that.
[14:31:00] <Forbidd3n> or put in a filter that checks if js is enabled and if not don't display page and give error
[14:31:10] <Forbidd3n> ok thanks
[14:31:17] <duch_kazatel> how would you check if JS is enabled?
[14:31:21] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: you know there is a feature in google chrome which 'suggest' you something you've already entered in such fields
[14:31:56] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: when you click(or select by keyboard) this suggestion it doesn't get fired by 'paste'
[14:32:21] <duch_kazatel> dwarder: ah, you need to look to see what that event is - i don't know what it is.
[14:33:25] <duch_kazatel> dwarder: I'd look here for more info - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8548533/any-event-triggered-on-autocomplete
[14:34:38] <duch_kazatel> brb
[14:36:22] <Gmac_> after my form is submitted with ajax. if there were mistakes they get higlited in red… but all my on(click events stop wokring
[14:40:46] <sunbeam> Does anyone know a good free jQuery / Javascript based translation tool?
[14:42:12] <duch_kazatel> Gmac_ - you'll need to either manually re-bind or use event delegation.
[14:47:35] <timbozeman> does chrome not work with if(something != '')   ?
[14:51:06] <Gmac_> duch_kazatel got any exampoles?
[14:51:45] <duch_kazatel> for what, rebinding the event?  do exactly what you did when you first bound it - you should setup a callback in the event that the form did not successfully submit.
[14:52:15] <duch_kazatel> for event delegation, check out the on method from jquery
[14:53:14] <Gmac_> i use the on method
[14:53:39] <andrew9184> is there a way to check if addClass animation is done ?
[14:54:03] <Gmac_> I'm using gravity form so it takes care of the ajax
[14:54:13] <Gmac_> …ill just have to shut ajax off for this form...easier
[14:54:58] <duch_kazatel> Gmac_ read the docs about "direct and delegated events" - you basically set on the parent container, but supply a selecter to try to match the events against.
[14:55:34] <Gmac_> yeah I've down that but how would that help once the page reload from ajax
[14:55:37] <Gmac_> but not a real reload
[14:56:13] <duch_kazatel> the parent node you bind to can't reload.
[14:56:47] <duch_kazatel> hell, even bind to window (though avoid this if you can)
[14:57:49] <duch_kazatel> you'd wind up with something $('body').on('click', 'li a', function(){console.log($(this)});
[14:58:03] <needloveadvice> hey guys i'm looking for a thumbnail rezise formula that will allow me to fit into a single frame
[14:58:21] <needloveadvice> I.E. i have a 240 x 160 px frame & want any photo to fit
[14:58:32] <needloveadvice> now if the photo is too big I just want to adjust it so it can be seen
[14:58:43] <needloveadvice> i'm just not sure how to do this
[14:58:58] <duch_kazatel> like, in a real frame?
[14:59:09] <needloveadvice> it's a div frame with overflow none
[14:59:22] <needloveadvice> so no matter how big the pic is, it makes it 240 x 160
[14:59:29] <needloveadvice> but I just want to make it a good thumbnail
[14:59:48] <duch_kazatel> so you want it to *fit* in a 240x160 without stretching/distorting?
[15:00:11] <needloveadvice> yeah
[15:00:23] <needloveadvice> and also get a nice view of what the photo probably looks like
[15:00:36] <duch_kazatel> what's that second part about?
[15:01:49] <duch_kazatel> as far as a solution, you'll have to calculate the height/width of the image, figure out which is smaller, then apply a 100% size to that dimension.
[15:02:18] <duch_kazatel> that make sense?
[15:04:38] <needloveadvice> it does
[15:04:41] <needloveadvice> and that's kinda what i do right now
[15:04:45] <needloveadvice> it's just centering it that's the problem
[15:05:16] <duch_kazatel> either set text-align: center; on the parent container, or set the image to display: block; and then margin: 0 auto;
[15:05:32] <duch_kazatel> can't remeber vertical alignment, but it's fairly trivial iirc.
[15:19:57] <Ontolog_> is there a method like .closest() but that searches in the other direction (i.e., descendants instead of ascendants)?
[15:20:05] <duch_kazatel> .find()
[15:20:22] <duch_kazatel> or .children(), depending on what you're looking for.
[15:21:27] <Ontolog_> no
[15:21:43] <Ontolog_> those don't include the jquery object's selected nodes
[15:22:42] <duch_kazatel> oh, you want to begin with the selected element.
[15:23:44] <duch_kazatel> try this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8961770/similar-to-jquery-closest-but-traversing-descedents
[15:24:32] <PhaseCode> Hey guys, I'm trying to create an accordian style effect on my tables see => http://jsfiddle.net/NkuVq/ can anyone give me some pointers I've tried everything :(
[15:26:29] <duch_kazatel> PhaseCode - there's no jquery in there.  what are you looking for?
[15:27:36] <PhaseCode> Everything I've tried doesn't work
[15:27:48] <PhaseCode> I've done #[tableName]).accordian()
[15:27:54] <PhaseCode> or the actually headers and stuff
[15:27:55] <duch_kazatel> what do you mean by "accordion style effect"?
[15:28:11] <PhaseCode> http://jqueryui.com/accordion/
[15:28:54] <PhaseCode> I want to use the Round Initial and Round 2 to open and close the data in the table
[15:32:05] <duch_kazatel> you need to custom bind to the "click" event on that particular cell to then run according on a custom area of the table, which might not work the way you want it to.
[15:32:29] <sunbeam> Has anyone ever used Google Translate API?
[15:35:07] <pzuraq> hey, for some reason I can't get .focus() to work on a specific circumstance. I'm using ember, and this happens when I change routes in a specific way.
[15:35:20] <pzuraq> jquery finds the element I want to focus just fine, but it doesn't actually focus it
[15:35:30] <pzuraq> anyone ever had this issue before?
[15:35:56] <Whirl3d> is the element disabled??
[15:36:52] <pzuraq> no, and I've tried setting a timeout on the function too
[15:36:59] <pzuraq> it might be ember doing something weird
[15:48:14] <steveoh> if i were to do $('.things').blur() would it blur all things
[15:48:29] <steveoh> or do i have to foreach them
[15:50:47] <axsuul> Anyone know of a simple js library that does modals
[15:51:09] <Gmac_> i have a method on('change')
[15:51:18] <Gmac_> i want to trigger it on page load
[15:51:28] <Gmac_> i used trigger('change') and i get nothing
[15:56:49] <pzuraq> haha figured it out!
[15:57:21] <pzuraq> Whirl3d: Because I was doing my function to switch routes when a tab was hit, the tab changing focus was messing things up
[15:57:29] <pzuraq> prevent tabbing event and bam, works fine
[15:57:31] <sonOfRa> steveoh, try it and see
[15:57:38] <steveoh> good advice
[15:57:43] <steveoh> hard to tell with blur'
[15:57:53] <steveoh> thanks though
[15:57:57] <steveoh> why not just answer the question
[15:58:00] <sonOfRa> then try with something else
[15:58:01] <steveoh> would have been less words
[15:58:13] <steveoh> do you not know?
[15:58:46] <sonOfRa> I might know, I might not know. But you aren't learning anything if I tell you
[15:58:58] <steveoh> i'm learning that you're a douche bag
[15:59:10] <steveoh> :)
[15:59:16] <steveoh> if you don't know stfu
[15:59:25] <steveoh> if you do know, say yes or no, and guess what. I learn!
[16:00:04] <sonOfRa> oh, insulting people is definitely the way to go if you're asking them for help
[16:00:24] <steveoh> you act as if you've helped me?
[16:00:37] <steveoh> you're wasting our time
[16:01:54] <tw2113> i'm wasting my own time, i won't give sonOfRa the pleasure
[16:02:30] <Gmac_> ohhh drama
[16:03:08] <sonOfRa> steveoh, you will have noticed by now, that you have wasted more time in this discussion, than it would have taken to simply try it out
[16:03:11] <duch_kazatel> steveoh you're going to have to try anyway - why is it a problem to try it multiple times?
[16:04:02] * steveoh resists urge to feed the hairy trolls
[16:04:09] <duch_kazatel> wat
[16:04:16] <duch_kazatel> that's not what "troll" means.
[16:04:30] <steveoh> i don't need you guys to help me by saying TIAS. thanks but no thanks
[16:04:49] <sonOfRa> what a douchebag Oo
[16:05:02] <duch_kazatel> what the fuck.
[16:05:14] <duch_kazatel> why do people come into these rooms and act like we owe them the world?
[16:05:24] <tw2113> we don't?!?!?!
[16:05:34] <duch_kazatel> you ask for OUR help, then give us shit when we offer it?
[16:06:00] <duch_kazatel> talking about steveoh - just strange

[16:07:31] <freebirD2> I've tryed it all, please, anybody, it's pretty simple
[16:08:09] <duch_kazatel> wat
[16:08:13] <reppard> var array = ["one","two"];  array.indexOf("two");  // Anyone know why chrome would return 4 or 5 for this?  Like its concating one string
[16:08:23] <reppard> works fine in firefox and IE
[16:08:53] <duch_kazatel> reppard - chrome returns 1 for me.
[16:09:00] <sonOfRa> var array = ["one","two"];  array.indexOf("two");
[16:09:00] <sonOfRa> 1

[16:09:26] <PhaseCode> Hey guys, so I'm trying to get the accordion effect to work on my table but I can't get it to do the effect, any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/NkuVq/1/
[16:19:15] <serapath> hi
[16:19:24] <serapath> how do i add an element to the DOM?
[16:19:40] <serapath> is it possible to "clone" an existing element?
[16:20:51] <duch_kazatel> dude, i can use google and get exatly what you want.
[16:21:30] <dualcore> http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[16:23:09] <reppard> duch_kazatel: i just tried and it does for me too
[16:23:24] <reppard> i'll have to show you the code i'm working with in a gist or something
[16:24:17] <serapath> ah perfect, thx
[16:24:20] <reppard> http://jsfiddle.net/reppard/hCDMW/
[16:24:31] <serapath> i found a code snippet which used Clone() instead of clone(), thats why it didnt work
[16:24:36] <reppard> so something like that, if status is "Expired" it returns 28
[16:27:58] <PhaseCode> Hey guys, so I'm trying to get the accordion effect to work on my table but I can't get it to do the effect, any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/NkuVq/1/
[16:29:37] <duch_kazatel> reppard - status and color in that example aren't arrays.
[16:30:20] <reppard> duch_kazatel: how so?
[16:31:14] <duch_kazatel> wait your declaring it weird 1 sec.
[16:31:15] <reppard> I am a ruby programmer so this js shit is new to me
[16:31:19] <duch_kazatel> aaaah
[16:31:19] <duch_kazatel> haha
[16:31:33] <duch_kazatel> that explains it :)
[16:31:46] <reppard> i thought i declared them as global variables
[16:32:09] <duch_kazatel> so when you declare vars in JS, you don't need to cast them the way you did - for an array, you can do:
[16:32:12] <duch_kazatel> var status = ['ConditionalSale', 'Deactivated', 'Expired', 'Incomplete', 'Live', 'Pending', 'Preview', 'Sold'];
[16:32:27] <duch_kazatel> the square brackets do the rest of the magic for you.
[16:32:39] <reppard> i tried that as well with the same result
[16:32:49] <reppard> thats how i'm use to declaring them actually =)
[16:33:29] <reppard> ruby is expressive as well but i thought i would try it that way to make sure it was an array
[16:34:04] <reppard> i mean, []+[] is empty string for christ sake
[16:35:25] <serapath> is this not possible? $('#targetGroup').append($('#targetGroup .popup').clone());
[16:36:03] <serapath> i have <div id="targetGroup"><input class="popup></div>
[16:36:04] <duch_kazatel> reppard - one sec.
[16:36:54] <duch_kazatel> try this: http://jsfiddle.net/JjxmR/
[16:36:56] <duch_kazatel> that do what you want?
[16:37:44] <serapath> damn, doesnt work :/
[16:38:09] <duch_kazatel> serapath - the code snipped you supplied is invalid.
[16:38:56] <serapath> chrome dev tools do not complain
[16:38:58] <duch_kazatel> reppard -checkout my last jsfiddle
[16:39:02] <serapath> but it doesnt work
[16:39:08] <reppard> duch_kazatel: it works in that fiddle
[16:39:10] <reppard> thats for sure
[16:39:11] <duch_kazatel>  <div id="targetGroup"><input class="popup></div> is not valid markup.
[16:39:23] <reppard> but not in my page
[16:39:27] <serapath> yes, there is more stuff to it
[16:39:33] <serapath> just wanted to reduce it to its basics
[16:39:37] <duch_kazatel> you're missing a quote in that sample.
[16:39:41] <serapath> yes i know
[16:39:44] <serapath> typo
[16:39:50] <duch_kazatel> and reppard - you have a table wrapping around those trs, right?
[16:40:06] <serapath> but with that quote, it still does not work
[16:40:43] <reppard> duch_kazatel: yes i do, i inspect element and see the classes (generated dynamically in php)
[16:40:47] <duch_kazatel> serapath what do you get when you run the javascript you supplied earlier.
[16:41:12] <duch_kazatel> reppard - but is there a table wrapping those?
[16:41:14] <reppard> if i do a console.log on status.indexOf(thisStatus) it returns freaking 28
[16:41:22] <serapath> <div id="targetGroup></div>
[16:41:39] <serapath> oh, forgot to mention, that i remove the existing <input
[16:41:44] <serapath> ah maybe i provide a pastebin
[16:41:49] <duch_kazatel> serapath please do.
[16:41:57] <duch_kazatel> actually use jsfiddle.
[16:41:57] <reppard> duch_kazatel: yes there is a table wrapping them
[16:42:15] <duch_kazatel> and reppard - hrm.  that sounds odd.  any errors in the js console?
[16:42:21] <reppard> not one
[16:42:25] <reppard> works fine in firefox
[16:42:28] <reppard> and IE
[16:42:34] <duch_kazatel> but not chrome?
[16:42:39] <reppard> no chrome
[16:42:44] <reppard> and oddly enough no safari
[16:42:49] <reppard> strangest shit ever
[16:42:54] <duch_kazatel> sounds like webkit maybe?
[16:43:41] <reppard> thats what i was thinking, i didn't think it would screw up standard array functionality though
[16:44:17] <duch_kazatel> actually, webkit doesn't handle the JS.
[16:44:29] <duch_kazatel> but maybe the DOM creation step is broken.
[16:44:34] <duch_kazatel> because of something invalid.
[16:45:11] <serapath> http://pastebin.com/t1r4FTyN
[16:45:47] <reppard> thats possible
[16:45:51] <reppard> it is a dumb iframe
[16:46:01] <serapath> ah typoe
[16:46:07] <serapath> the class general doesnt exist, instead its popup
[16:46:15] <serapath> i correct it
[16:46:59] <reppard> i'll keep digging, thanks for the help duch_kazatel
[16:47:35] <serapath> http://pastebin.com/7cb3B0cD
[16:48:27] <serapath> its simple: i save a reference to a DOM element, clone that DOM element, remove the original DOM element and append the cloned one
[16:49:47] <serapath> i expected the result to be <div id="targetGroup"><h4>Target Group</h4><input id="123" type="text" name="123" class="popup tm-tag tm-targetGroup tm-group"></div>
[16:50:01] <serapath> why is it not? what am i doing wrong?
[16:50:23] <serapath> btw: var myID = 123;
[16:55:54] <shoky> serapath:  seems fine http://jsfiddle.net/ftHfn/
[17:04:48] <serapath> ok
[17:08:29] <serapath> shoky: but it doesnt work :-(
[17:08:31] <serapath> fuck
[17:08:35] <serapath> what am i missing?
[17:08:56] <shoky> serapath: works fine in the fiddle. can't help you with a problem i can't see
[17:10:02] <serapath> http://pastebin.com/ub5TPw9T
[17:10:05] <serapath> thats my real code
[17:10:11] <serapath> what is different?
[17:13:15] <serapath> ah, found one mistake, but didnt fix it
[17:13:16] <serapath> http://pastebin.com/Kg04K1Xe
[17:13:28] <serapath> instead of append(tm) i now use append(tm.element)
[17:13:31] <serapath> but still the same error
[17:13:36] <serapath> or unexpected behavior
[17:14:13] <serapath> any idea?
[17:14:58] <duch_kazatel> is tm.element a valid dom element?
[17:15:09] <serapath> its created in the if
[17:15:11] <serapath> right?
[17:15:22] <shoky> serapath: why tm.element
[17:15:26] <duch_kazatel> (i'm not even looking at your code)
[17:15:29] <shoky> tm is an element already
[17:15:32] <serapath> line 19
[17:15:43] <shoky> line 19 doesn't change tm
[17:15:58] <serapath> ah damn, seems as something is wrong :P
[17:16:12] <shoky> anyways, tm will only get assigned to if the "if" in line 15 is entered
[17:16:23] <shoky> otherwise, you won't append anything on line 23
[17:16:24] <serapath> i should add tagManagers[myID], not tm or tm.element
[17:16:25] <serapath> fuck
[17:16:26] <serapath> :P
[17:17:02] <shoky> yeh
[17:17:06] <Whirl3d> on line 19, should taManager(myID) be there?
[17:17:13] <serapath> fuck, still doesnt work
[17:17:33] <serapath> shit, should be tagManagers
[17:17:36] <serapath> not tagManager
[17:17:38] <serapath> d'oh
[17:17:44] <Whirl3d> serapath, if the admins catch you cussing this much, they'll likely kick you.
[17:18:00] <Whirl3d> What about the ()
[17:18:22] <serapath> ah no
[17:18:26] <serapath> tagManager is actually correct
[17:18:33] <serapath> anyway, shouldnt chane a thing, because i dont use it
[17:18:35] <shoky> he's calling an external function, it seems
[17:18:40] <Whirl3d> is tagManager a function
[17:18:54] <Whirl3d> k
[17:18:58] <serapath> yes, its from http://welldonethings.com/tags/manager
[17:19:05] <serapath> it actually creates the tagManagers behavior
[17:19:09] <shoky> serapath: if you got a problem, reproduce the issue on jsfiddle
[17:19:11] <serapath> however it does that
[17:19:31] <serapath> thats often easier said then done, because the project is huge and it would take a lot to reproduce it
[17:19:40] <serapath> actually i use slickgrid with several thousand lines of code
[17:19:43] <serapath> and it reads that
[17:19:56] <serapath> every line in the table can have its own editor modal
[17:20:01] <serapath> where one element is that tag manager
[17:21:20] <serapath> actually, does this look like a valid DOM element?
[17:21:21] <serapath> [input#a000000133.popup input-small tm-tag tm-targetGroup tm-group, prevObject: jQuery.fn.jQuery.init[1], context: document, jquery: "1.9.1", constructor: function, init: function…]
[17:21:37] <shoky> looks like a jquery object wrapping an input
[17:21:47] <serapath> its what chrome dev tools give me when i do console.log(tm) and console.log(tagManagers(myID))
[17:21:49] <serapath> so its the same for both
[17:22:17] <serapath> so whatever that clone() thing gives me
[17:22:22] <serapath> its stored in tm
[17:22:34] <serapath> and its stored in tagManagers(myID).element
[17:22:45] <serapath> i update the pastebin
[17:22:52] <duch_kazatel> sera - use jsfiddle.
[17:22:52] <reppard> exit
[17:22:53] <duch_kazatel> seriously.
[17:22:53] <shoky> whatever. stop spamming your thoughtstream
[17:22:54] <Whirl3d> when you select a class of elements and apply the clone method does it just clone one? or all of them?
[17:23:03] <serapath> http://pastebin.com/2Q8UbwzW
[17:24:01] <serapath> i cant see the difference between that code and jsFiddle you gave me
[17:24:08] <shoky> serapath: use jsfiddle. it's not fair that only you get to see the problem. it's highly annoying, rude, and a waste of time
[17:24:09] <serapath> i see the jsFiddle works
[17:24:20] <serapath> ok i try
[17:26:50] <shoky> uhm serapath.. your input doesn't have a popup class
[17:27:04] <shoky> at least in the last pastebin
[17:27:33] <codecookie> shoky
[17:27:48] <shoky> codecookie
[17:27:53] <codecookie> I don't understand, on facebook they do this
[17:28:02] <codecookie> the photo has same exact dimensions but for one of them they go left:-33px;
[17:28:07] <codecookie> and for the other left:0px;
[17:28:19] <codecookie> this is when they post an album & it has extra photos
[17:28:28] <shoky> wtf does this have to do with me
[17:28:32] <codecookie> it's bugging me so much, how are they able to do this
[17:28:34] <codecookie> cuz i'm wondering
[17:28:39] <codecookie> how would they know to format 1 vs the other
[17:28:50] <shoky> no idea what you're talking about
[17:28:59] <codecookie> ok so if you go to a facebook users timeline
[17:29:07] <codecookie> it has an album post & shows the main photo & 3 other photos
[17:29:10] <shoky> emphasis on "if"
[17:29:20] <codecookie> you've never been?
[17:30:33] <shoky> sure have. ugly shit
[17:30:47] <codecookie> you don't like facebook?
[17:31:39] <shoky> nope
[17:43:57] <codecookie> ok so heres my question then
[17:44:21] <codecookie> is there any jquery object recognition, I don't want it to recognize a face I want it to recognize an object in the photo
[17:44:37] <duch_kazatel> wat
[17:44:44] <codecookie> so if the pic is of a water bottle & it has a grass field in the background, I want it to zoom in on the water bottle
[17:44:51] <codecookie> or atleast put the water bottle in the middle
[17:45:09] <duch_kazatel> why would you want to do that in jquery?
[17:45:10] <codecookie> so I guess foreground object recognition
[17:45:19] <codecookie> i'm asking if a plugin exist
[17:45:38] <duch_kazatel> probably not because why would you want to do that?
[17:45:50] <codecookie> so on a thumbnail of a photo
[17:45:51] <Whirl3d> I don't think that technology has been mastered yet...
[17:45:57] <codecookie> it just shows the good part of the photo
[17:46:15] <duch_kazatel> codecookie you're talking about responsive images.
[17:46:16] <codecookie> instead of cutting it off to much to left or right
[17:46:22] <codecookie> this exist?
[17:46:26] <Whirl3d> NOw there are lots of custom zooming image galleries, but you select the zoom location or the mouse does
[17:46:41] <codecookie> it's just on facebook it looks like they do it..
[17:46:47] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:46:57] <codecookie> when you post an album with photos, it adjust the photo
[17:47:00] <codecookie> so it's cropped properly
[17:47:05] <wer0ckz> help about nodejs please.
[17:47:13] <duch_kazatel> that's not a jquery effect more than likely.
[17:47:19] <codecookie> wellw hat is it?
[17:47:22] <duch_kazatel> wer0ckz go to #nodejs
[17:47:23] <codecookie> how do they do this shit lol
[17:47:31] <duch_kazatel> backend image processing.
[17:48:06] <Whirl3d> either that or 99% of the photos  on the planet have the content in one of two composition rules: rule of thirds or just centered.
[17:48:08] <codecookie> what should I look for?
[17:48:22] <codecookie> whirl, they do something because
[17:48:32] <codecookie> on some posts it's like -33px; and then on others it leaves it 0px
[17:48:34] <codecookie> sometimes -36px
[17:48:37] <duch_kazatel> codecookie they're probably not using off the shelf processing for that.
[17:48:38] <Whirl3d> why don't you ask #facebook
[17:48:38] <codecookie> something is changing the var
[17:48:51] <codecookie> well what could it be then duch?
[17:48:59] <duch_kazatel> they wrote the software in house.
[17:48:59] <Whirl3d> depends on the source image
[17:49:14] <codecookie> well they're not doing this by hand
[17:49:20] <codecookie> so some computer is analyzing it
[17:49:22] <duch_kazatel> ....
[17:49:23] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[17:49:29] <duch_kazatel> they probably wrote software that's doing this for them.
[17:49:30] <Whirl3d> in your example. the source images were probably 10 px (5 on each side) different
[17:49:51] <codecookie> and you can check this?
[17:50:30] <codecookie> the source images
[17:50:32] <codecookie> were exactly the same
[17:50:41] <duch_kazatel> huh?  i'm not saying with 100% certainty, but it's likely that they wrote this software internally.  i can almost tell you with 100% certainty this is not done client-side.
[17:51:00] <Whirl3d> and certainly not Jquery
[17:51:05] <codecookie> hmmm
[17:51:07] <duch_kazatel> DEFFO not using jquery.
[17:51:11] <codecookie> idk like I found this
[17:51:25] <codecookie> http://code.google.com/p/resize-crop/
[17:51:42] <codecookie> but then that's actually cropping the photo whereas on fbook they simply move the photo
[17:52:09] <duch_kazatel> *sigh* what's the problem you're trying to solve?  are you just curious or are you trying to implement something?
[17:52:47] <codecookie> i literally want the photos just to look normal
[17:52:56] <codecookie> and I thought maybe i'm just out of the loop
[17:52:59] <Whirl3d> http://designshack.net/articles/css/focal-point-intelligent-cropping-of-responsive-images/
[17:53:23] <duch_kazatel> then do what everybody else does - tell users to constrain images themselves.
[17:53:27] <codecookie> whril that looks nice
[17:53:39] <codecookie> is that real I have yet to look at the code
[17:54:28] <codecookie> i think imma use focal point
[17:54:30] <codecookie> that thing is sick
[17:54:58] <Whirl3d> http://croppola.com/
[17:56:43] <codecookie> holy crap!!
[17:56:51] <codecookie> guess what, although I loved what you posted
[17:57:03] <codecookie> the original that I sent you guys had a kittens example
[17:57:13] <codecookie> and i checked the code, it's exact output of fbook
[17:57:31] <codecookie> http://resize-crop.galik.it/
[17:57:37] <codecookie> mystery solved imma use this
[17:57:54] <codecookie> thx for just talking me through that, you guys rock
[17:58:18] <codecookie> also learned a bunch of new cool stuff, such as focal point imaging thx so much !! :-)
[17:58:48] <duch_kazatel> you are aware that library doesn't do what you think it does, right?
[18:07:15] <codecookie> duch, it might not do exactly what I want
[18:07:24] <raj> I miss you shoky
[18:07:39] <codecookie> but it's enough to just crop something
[18:09:15] <shoky> i miss me too, raj
[18:09:38] <shoky> but u moar

[19:23:56] <mrconfused786> http://jsfiddle.net/2JeKc/
[19:24:30] <mrconfused786> why is it undefined on line 22
[19:27:42] <mrconfused786> figured it out

[20:02:06] <ses1984> it doesn't seem to do that for me, but i would like to do that but i'm not sure how
[20:05:56] <delinquentme> https://gist.github.com/delinquentme/6137227
[20:06:10] <delinquentme> so is there a way to directly reference the obj im testing there in the first line?
[20:06:23] <delinquentme> self.text() doesnt do it ... so I'm simply repeating the query
[20:19:43] <delinquentme> var rowComment = $(this).find('.commentField').text() != '[Click to edit]' ? $(this).find('.commentField').text() : "0";
[20:19:46] <delinquentme> more eloquent way?
[20:26:48] <VectorX> in chrome dev tools, if you select an element is there a way to see js events attached to the element similar to the css ?
[21:46:08] <tds5016> hey. If I wanted to use fittext with requirejs... how would one go about doing such a thing?

[22:57:16] <paolo> Question: when doing .focus() is it normal that the cursor is not showing (on an input box)
[23:49:23] <jamen> hi guys,
[23:49:34] <jamen> I find there is something wrong with the .attr() method in jquery version 1.10.2 and 1.9.1
[23:49:53] <jamen> I try the code below, when changing the radio selection, $('#option_1').attr('checked') is always 'checked'.
[23:50:02] <jamen> But when using jquery-1.8.3, there is no such bug.
[23:50:10] <jamen> Can anyone tells why?
