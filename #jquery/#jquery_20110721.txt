[00:00:05] <Whirl3d> just a lot of can't read property nodetype of undefined
[00:00:33] <Demia> Whirl3d: as far as i can tell thats unrelated
[00:01:39] <djQuery> fixed it
[00:01:47] <Demia> djQuery: good, what was it?
[00:02:58] <djQuery> the table didnt have an id so when accessing the scheme.Tables[undefined]
[00:03:07] <djQuery> used .index() instead
[00:03:35] <Demia> ah okay just curious.
[00:03:43] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/apesih/12/
[00:04:27] <Demia> djQuery: odd still not draggable for me
[00:04:46] <djQuery> browser?
[00:04:57] <Demia> djQuery: latest chrome beta
[00:05:03] <djQuery> same here
[00:05:13] <Demia> hm..
[00:05:20] <djQuery> you have to grab it by the header at the top of the table.
[00:05:28] <djQuery> as the actual rows are sortable
[00:05:58] <Demia> i tried everywhere, it seems like the tables are not really getting any jquery applied to them at all for me
[00:07:25] <djQuery> realy???????? does the resize handle need a 1001 zindex? it shows up when you drag one element on top of another
[00:08:11] <Demia> djQuery: i got nothing.. seems odd, no errors.
[00:11:05] <coldhead> botsyyyyy
[00:11:11] * coldhead hugs bot-t 
[00:11:11] * bot-t hugs coldhead back
[00:12:03] <bot-t> Sorry guys, had a doctor's appt.
[00:14:47] <coldhead> i hope everything's okay lil buddy
[00:14:52] <coldhead> lumps :(
[00:17:25] <coldhead> i think we need a startup that uses clojurescript exclusively
[00:18:17] <systemfault> But why....
[00:18:25] <systemfault> Bunch of hippies. :/
[00:18:31] <systemfault> Coffeescript is way nicer
[00:18:46] <coldhead> coffeescript looks like pseudocode!
[00:18:53] <systemfault> But hipsters need something else now that coffeescript is more popular
[00:18:56] <coldhead> at least with () it looks like programming
[00:19:28] <timing> clojure? wtf is that
[00:20:05] <systemfault> clojure is a dialect of LISP running on the JVM
[00:20:13] <TeddyMurray> any jquery nuts awake? :)
[00:20:16] <systemfault> clojurescript.. you can guess what it is.
[00:20:45] <timing> okay
[00:21:32] <TeddyMurray> systemfault, coudl you help me with a jqueryui slider problem?
[00:21:48] <systemfault> http://memegenerator.net/instance/8966434 :)
[00:21:58] <systemfault> TeddyMurray: I can't help with that, sorry
[00:22:06] <TeddyMurray> darn D:
[00:22:14] <TeddyMurray> well, maybe its more a logic error..
[00:23:57] <xeranas> Morning,
[00:23:57] <xeranas> I have newbie question: How I can call function from iFrame window? (working with modal dialog but bit stuck..)
[00:24:43] <systemfault> xeranas: If the page in the iframe is not on the same domain, all hope is lost.
[00:24:57] <xeranas> it same domain
[00:25:59] <xeranas> I looking how to make submit data in modal dialog and press 'submit' and then it close
[00:31:53] <RenaKunisaki> hey, why does jQuery.getJSON('http://127.0.0.1:11112/') request a file named 127.0.0.1:11112 from the current domain? can I not put an absolute path here?
[00:33:24] <Anticom> hi all
[00:33:44] <Anticom> i've got a problem with my autocomplete: http://pastebin.com/ZKwHPX7t
[00:34:09] <Anticom> the list won't show up... firebug console output looks like there is some issue with mapping the data
[00:34:28] <TeddyMurray> could someone explain this syntax? $('.edit-slider-next a', parent_item).bind()
[00:35:05] <Anticom> TeddyMurray http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[00:35:10] <TeddyMurray> not the bind method
[00:35:19] <Anticom> what else then?
[00:35:20] <TeddyMurray> the 'element', parent-element
[00:35:22] <Whirl3d> same as $(parent_item).find('.edit-slider.....
[00:35:27] <TeddyMurray> is it like, in relation ?
[00:35:29] <TeddyMurray> ahh
[00:35:39] <Whirl3d> $(item, something) is like find item in something
[00:35:49] <TeddyMurray> thanks
[00:35:57] <Whirl3d> np
[00:36:48] <TeddyMurray> for some reason, my bind('click', function(event) { is getting called twice, even though
[00:36:51] <TeddyMurray> im only clicking once
[00:36:51] <TeddyMurray> lol
[00:37:13] <Anticom> maybe, you've got two elements selected
[00:37:14] <Whirl3d> are you stopping propogation by returning false or e.preventDefault();?
[00:37:46] <TeddyMurray> yea i am, even though i didn't know what it was until you just otld me
[00:37:47] <TeddyMurray> lol
[00:38:30] <TeddyMurray> mind if i pastebin some code, Whirl3d ?
[00:41:15] <Whirl3d> sure.
[00:46:23] <TeddyMurray> Whirl3d, http://pastebin.com/K58bWcCA
[00:46:28] <TeddyMurray> and http://bilalaldawah.com/edit.html
[00:46:48] <TeddyMurray> basically -- when an element is added to the scrolling pane, the next and previous buttons start going twice
[00:46:52] <TeddyMurray> instead of just once
[00:47:41] <Whirl3d> Actually, it appears to only do that where you added the card
[00:47:42] <TeddyMurray> line 378 is the bind('click' code
[00:47:54] <Whirl3d> if you add the card in the middle, it skips one in the middle.
[00:48:10] <TeddyMurray> try adding it to the beginning
[00:48:10] <Whirl3d> so it goes from 3 to 5 rather than 3 to the newly inserted 4
[00:48:45] <TeddyMurray> if you drag the little scroll thing though, works fine D:
[00:51:37] <TeddyMurray> the thing that confuses me the most though, is that if i put an alert('') in the bind('click' its called twice
[00:51:40] <TeddyMurray> when i click once lol
[00:52:08] <TeddyMurray> is there some way the slideTo method is calling back to the bind?
[00:55:28] <Whirl3d> not seeing slideTo
[00:55:58] <TeddyMurray> line 335
[00:56:22] <TeddyMurray> maybe too much code? should i post only relevant parts?
[00:56:58] <Whirl3d> Pfew, it is a lot of code to look at. LOL Maybe a jsfiddle with just the problem parts?
[00:58:08] <TeddyMurray> okie
[00:59:13] <VasilisWong> test
[01:02:05] <RenaKunisaki> tickle
[01:02:19] <dr0id> giggle
[01:06:06] <crab> if i do $('foo').click(function () { ... }), can i later fetch the function i bound to click on foo?
[01:09:51] <RenaKunisaki> OK, now I have getJSON() making a request to the server, I can see it, the reply comes back, but the success callback never fires and Firebug shows the request body being empty. what gives?
[01:11:53] <Whirl3d> incorrect filetype declaration maybe?
[01:11:57] <Whirl3d> docType, sorry
[01:12:06] <RenaKunisaki> doctype in a JSON file?
[01:12:30] <Whirl3d> It's late here. I thought I read Ajax. LOL Sorry
[01:12:44] <TeddyMurray> ugh, Whirl3d i can't get it to work in jsfiddle D:
[01:13:27] <Whirl3d> TeddyMurray, I still don't think it is firing twice as much as it's skipping something.
[01:14:00] <Whirl3d> can you animate the page to slide on click...then it would be obvious if it was clicking twice
[01:14:12] <Whirl3d> like it does with the slider
[01:14:25] <djcoin> Hi folks
[01:14:42] <Whirl3d> Hi
[01:14:44] <TeddyMurray> Whirl3d, that might fix my problem actually
[01:15:04] <TeddyMurray> instead of making it calculate the margins.. just silde over just like the slidebar
[01:15:20] <Whirl3d> I would even use the same function to be sure
[01:15:21] <TeddyMurray> im sure its like some type of "remainder" that's making it jump back and forth
[01:15:30] <djcoin> I was wondering, is there to add a callback on a trigger not to the end, but to insert anywhere in the queue of callback waiting to be triggered ?
[01:15:40] <djcoin> s/is there/is there a way/
[01:15:54] <Whirl3d> djcoin, perhaps you could look at custom queue's
[01:16:02] <Whirl3d> ?queue
[01:16:03] <bot-t> .queue([queueName]): Show the queue of functions to be executed on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[01:16:16] <djcoin> oh thanks
[01:16:28] <Whirl3d> Yeah!  Bot-t is back. Good checkup I take it.
[01:16:53] <RenaKunisaki> OK, so it calls .error(), but how do I figure out what the error is
[01:17:08] <djcoin> Btw, my use case is: I have a submit form button bound at the beginning. And on some occasion I need to stop the submitting action if some fields contain errors or so
[01:18:21] <xeranas> how I can call function on parrent window by clickink element which is inside iFrame (domain is same)
[01:18:50] <port101> hi
[01:19:31] <Whirl3d> djcoin, it sounds as though you just want to disable the submit button until certain criteria are met.
[01:20:05] <dreamdisorder> Hi all i am having issues installing jquery in drupal 6 can some one take me through a step by step i think my issues is where the library is supposed to be....i did some reaserch on this and found that there may be an issue with how the module folder is named with an underscore verses a period ...any takers ?
[01:20:36] <Whirl3d> <--no drupal knowledge here. sorry
[01:21:24] <coldhead> seutje is the jQuery/drupal guy
[01:21:29] <coldhead> he's aroundn't
[01:21:43] <djcoin> It may look like this, but in fact its a bit complicated. What I want to do, It may not be user friendly, is that: when someone validate an autocomplete field, I want to make sure, he did not type garbage. I check that when he presses enter on the field, which trigger both a change on the field (that i want to check) and then immediatly after a submit
[01:22:06] <djcoin> If the field is filled with garbage, i want to reset it, and not to trigger the submit
[01:22:11] <dreamdisorder> thanks Coldhean let me try and find him
[01:22:13] <djcoin> otherwise, submit the form
[01:23:09] <djcoin> Does it make sense ?
[01:23:33] <Whirl3d> so, you want the submit to fire when the person presses enter on the field?
[01:23:34] <coldhead> garbage is hard to detect
[01:24:00] <Whirl3d> One man's garbage...
[01:25:00] <Whirl3d> So make a fake submit button, bind the click event to validate the form, then call the submit action
[01:26:18] <coldhead> ?nopm @ dreamdisorder
[01:26:18] <bot-t> dreamdisorder, Please keep all questions and code in the channel so everyone has a chance to help and benefit. Only privately message someone if he/she specifically requests it, e.g. for cyber.
[01:26:38] <djcoin> Im not sure to get what you meant Whirl3d
[01:26:53] <djcoin> But in fact, the real problem is: when the person presses enter on the field
[01:27:04] <djcoin> it triggers both: a change in the field
[01:27:04] <TeddyMurray> debugging is so time consuming.. and you never know how long it will take
[01:27:10] <djcoin> and the submit action
[01:27:14] <djcoin> I didnot choose that
[01:27:32] <coldhead> TeddyMurray: if debugging is the process of removing bugs then programming must be the process of adding them
[01:27:37] <TeddyMurray> lol
[01:27:54] <Whirl3d> <--true for me. The more I program the more bugs I make
[01:28:38] <coldhead> true for everyone!
[01:28:42] <Whirl3d> djcoin, you are gonna have to show us some code at this point. Maybe you could make a fiddle with an example.
[01:28:53] <coldhead> and home time is when you start adding more bugs than features per hour
[01:29:27] <djcoin> Whirl3d: ok because hitting enter triggering both change on the field and submi is a behaviour that should not happen ?
[01:29:27] <Whirl3d> Wait, you add features? Not just bugs? I knew I was doing something wrong
[01:29:28] <TeddyMurray> Whirl3d,
[01:29:50] <Whirl3d> yes, TeddyMurray,
[01:30:06] <TeddyMurray> http://bilalaldawah.com/edit.html i made it so it resets the slider value, and the pane margin-left when it adds a new one
[01:30:26] <TeddyMurray> but -- as you can see -- the margins are off when you go over by a little bit, and the slider count is off too
[01:30:32] <Whirl3d> djcoin, if the focus is being shifted to the submit button and the user presses enter, it could fire the button
[01:30:50] <djcoin> Thats not whats happening
[01:31:09] <djcoin> what is*
[01:31:26] <TeddyMurray> i think the problem is like some "remainder" on the margin
[01:31:53] <Whirl3d> TeddyMurray, if you drag the item with the slider, the margins are messed up if you let go anywhere inbetween cards
[01:31:56] <Whirl3d> right?
[01:32:04] <TeddyMurray> yeah
[01:32:07] <Whirl3d> But next and prev cards don't animate at all.
[01:32:18] <Whirl3d> Where does it slide the content?
[01:32:19] <TeddyMurray> what do you mean by animate? .animate()?
[01:32:36] <TeddyMurray> slideTo(dir) line 337
[01:32:43] <Whirl3d> brb checking
[01:32:46] <TeddyMurray> ty
[01:33:20] <kggle> Hey guys, i get some error like this "$("a[rel^='prettyPhoto']").prettyPhoto is not a function" why this message appears? thanks!
[01:33:21] <Whirl3d> do you mean line 337 in pencils.js?
[01:33:53] <merlin1978> Any have experienced jquery $('#msgdlgTxt').text("Successfully updated "); not working?
[01:34:11] <Whirl3d> sorry, I just saw the falshcard script. LOL chekcing it now.
[01:34:37] <TeddyMurray> flashcard
[01:34:37] <TeddyMurray> ah
[01:34:47] <TeddyMurray> okay =], ty for helping Whirl3d i really appreciate it
[01:37:21] <Anticom> in what case will be the error event triggered instead of the success event, although the script responded to the ajax request?
[01:38:12] <Anticom> "[object Object]parsererrorSyntaxError: invalid labe" <-- those are the errors i get
[01:38:51] <bjhaid> please is it possible for me to load a page and let it automatically minimize on page load, and pop-up a dialog when an event is triggered?
[01:39:13] <Anticom> bjhaid why don't you simply use jq ui dialog?
[01:39:29] <xeranas> inside iFrame i call $(window.parent.document).myParrentWindowFunction() but firebug say that function cant be found (at least in right format I'm trying reach that function?)
[01:40:44] <bjhaid> Anticom: i am using the UI dialog, but I want a page to trigger my page externally and when my page loads, it should minimize and the jquery-ui dialog should display only when the desired event it triggered, (the second part works, minimizing the page on page load is what i dont know if i can combine with the dialog)
[01:42:01] <TeddyMurray> Whirl3d, im testing something but maybe this will help you
[01:42:29] <Anticom> bjhaid http://www.boutell.com/newfaq/creating/windowfeatures.html and http://www.devshed.com/c/a/JavaScript/Controlling-Browser-Properties-with-JavaScript/ might help you
[01:42:34] <TeddyMurray> i removed the slideTo in the two prev and next buttons, and replaced it with var sliderCurrentValue = scrollbar.slider( "option", "value" );scrollbar.slider( "value", sliderCurrentValue + 10 );
[01:42:34] <TeddyMurray>       
[01:42:36] <Anticom> dunno, wether jq offers something natively
[01:42:48] <TeddyMurray> so now it slides like the bar on top does, but
[01:42:56] <djcoin> I thought there way an "events" method to get events associated to an element oO
[01:42:59] <djcoin> I cant find it
[01:42:59] <TeddyMurray> alignment is still a bit off
[01:43:19] <Anticom> how can jquery complain about a parse error, when the returned json-object is valid? =(
[01:43:22] <Anticom> i don't get it
[01:44:54] <edzjins> hi
[01:45:08] <bjhaid> Anticom: thanks, let me read up
[01:46:08] <safzouf> Hi all
[01:46:32] <safzouf> is it possible to put the jqzoom windows inside the bigImage ?
[01:47:03] <safzouf> and make it move to another corner if the mouse gets next to.
[01:47:35] <bjhaid> Anticom: something just crossed my mind, what if I made the size of the page the smallest size? and dialog pops-up when an event is triggered
[01:47:36] <bjhaid> ?\
[01:48:13] <safzouf> any hints about jqzoom
[01:48:23] <bot-t> bjhaid, jQuery API - Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/
[01:48:34] <Whirl3d> TeddyMurray, is it possible that $("prev",editbar).bind("click" ....is actually being bound to the prev button and not the anchor. If so, then the anchor would be the eventTarget and it would fire first, then the anchor's parent would fire and stop prop.
[01:49:29] <Whirl3d> in your click handler, console.log(event.target) to see which item is the target. If it shows two targets (cause it's firing twice) we can go from there
[01:51:23] <TeddyMurray> ok
[01:51:49] <TeddyMurray> says <a href='#next'>etc..
[01:51:58] <TeddyMurray> only once
[01:53:21] <Anticom> bjhaid just give it a try
[01:53:42] <bjhaid> Anticom: thanks
[01:53:44] <catcatcat> Hi, I am using jquery fomr validation plugin: http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/ it works all fine, but my whole page is in one form and i have 3 logins (it is .net) hitting submit on one of the submit buttons, it validates also other others. is there any other way to do it?
[01:54:51] <TeddyMurray> i don't think its being called twice, Whirl3d, i think it might be because of the percentage... when there's five elements
[01:55:01] <TeddyMurray> it needs to move by 25, 6 elements, uhh
[01:55:04] <TeddyMurray> whatever 100 / 6 is
[01:55:16] <TeddyMurray> 17%
[01:55:37] <TeddyMurray> im still trying like.. a hundred different things though
[01:55:38] <TeddyMurray> lol
[01:56:16] <Whirl3d> So, I don't understand why you are using percentages instead of whole number coefficients?
[01:56:43] <Whirl3d> Why not keep track of the current card and then next adds the width of one card to the margin of the previous card
[01:57:06] <TeddyMurray> well, im working with someone elses code, but im willing to change anything here
[01:57:28] <TeddyMurray> i think current_page is the current card
[01:57:37] <Whirl3d> Then the only thing that changes is the endpoints ...rather than 0-100 being your range, you'd have 0-5 or 0-6 and then multiply that by the width of the card
[01:57:58] <TeddyMurray> ohhh
[01:58:18] <Whirl3d> then, you'd add a card and it would become 0-7
[01:58:19] <TeddyMurray> so set the range for the slider to be zero through card_count
[01:58:26] <Whirl3d> that's what I would try
[01:58:28] <TeddyMurray> kk im gunna try it now
[01:58:35] <TeddyMurray> *crosses fingers*
[01:58:40] <Whirl3d> Then it makes it easier for the slider as well.
[01:58:52] <adioe3> hi guys. how do i get the slider's options inside a "create" event function? (create : function(event,ui){...}) ?
[01:59:00] <Whirl3d> Round to the nearest whole number multiple of the location of the slider and slide to that number times the width
[02:00:23] <TeddyMurray> hmm, so i need to call the slider() constructor every time a card is added or deleted?
[02:00:45] <TeddyMurray> or wait, i can do scrollbar.slider('max',card_count);
[02:00:58] <Whirl3d> I am not really familiar with your slider script.
[02:01:19] <TeddyMurray> http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#method-option
[02:01:44] <TeddyMurray> that logically makes sense though, you're a good programmer lol
[02:02:11] <TeddyMurray> to be able to deduce that, with little knowledge of the code y ou're looking at
[02:02:23] <coldhead> Whirl3d++
[02:03:51] <coldhead> whatever happened to codeputty
[02:05:02] <Whirl3d> {blush} thx.
[02:05:19] <Whirl3d> I would use the slider example for controlling tabs.
[02:05:50] <TeddyMurray> good idea!
[02:05:51] <TeddyMurray> lol
[02:05:58] <Whirl3d> Because the slider jumps from position to position, you don't have the continuous sliding thing going on that would cause margin errors
[02:06:00] <TeddyMurray> maybe my brain is just broken, i can't think out of the box
[02:06:08] <TeddyMurray> i get stuck on a problem like this, and don't look for "other" solutions
[02:06:14] <bjhaid1> please how do I autoclose a jquery in response to an if condition (e.g. if a == a)
[02:06:24] <Whirl3d> Well, using someone else's code is tricky.
[02:06:39] <Whirl3d> So, you are doing fine
[02:07:26] <clockwize> hey guys, how would I get the height of the window viewport?
[02:08:51] <TeddyMurray> yeah i think all this margin stuff is retarded :)
[02:08:57] <TeddyMurray> i thought it was retarded when i seen'd it
[02:09:08] <coldhead> $(window).height()
[02:10:55] <kez> hello , anyone available ?
[02:11:16] <Cork> ?ask @ kez
[02:11:16] <bot-t> kez, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:11:56] <kez> I want to fade an element inserted in DOM with after() , my line is :  jQuery('#cnp').after(error_div).fadeIn('slow');  , but it obviusly doesnt work
[02:16:32] <Cork> kez: what isis error_div ?
[02:16:48] <kez> Cork: its just a js var
[02:16:49] <Cork> is it html, a new dom element or an old dom element?
[02:16:57] <coldhead> i believe isis is the egyptian goddess of the moon
[02:17:08] <Cork> (that is is it in dom or not been added yet
[02:17:09] <Cork> )
[02:17:29] <kez> its a newly added html
[02:17:36] <Cork> ok
[02:17:41] <kez> and I want to insert it with a fade effect
[02:18:00] <Cork> kez: jQuery('#cnp').after(jQuery(error_div).hide()).fadeIn('slow');
[02:18:13] <Cork> oh wait, no
[02:18:19] <Cork> sorry
[02:18:31] <kez> hmm , wait , you're on to something
[02:18:32] <Cork> kez: is #cnp visible or not?
[02:18:38] <kez> I'll make an jquery object
[02:18:57] <Cork> ya
[02:18:59] <kez> yes it is , maybe jQuery('#cnp').after(jQuery(error_div).fadeIn('slow'));
[02:19:14] <kez> hmm
[02:19:25] <Cork> kez: you need to save it before you add it to the dom
[02:20:04] <Cork> var $error_div = jQuery(error_div).hide(); jQuery('#cnp').after($error_div); $error_div.fadeIn('slow');
[02:20:07] <Cork> should work
[02:20:25] <kez> ok thanks , will try
[02:24:36] <kez> yep , making it a jquery obj and applying the necesarry methods , and later inserting it into DOM was the key , thanks Cork
[02:25:46] <xeranas> hmm, do my situation is very complex? I still can't figure out how close my model dialog from inside iFrame:/
[02:35:04] <pr0ton> anybody has used qtip2 ?
[02:41:16] <D_INS> Hi, I have problem with JQM and GoogleMaps. http://pastebin.com/eKB1y34Z - here is my code. The problem is map is showing only if <div id="map_canvas"></div> is in body part. I want to add header and footer, map is not showing. pls help
[02:42:52] <pr0ton> D_INS, can you post it on jsfiddle.net ?
[02:44:14] <D_INS> pr0ton, sec
[02:46:07] <coldhead> sure is pissing down
[02:48:28] <D_INS> pr0ton this is first time using jsfiddle.net. http://jsfiddle.net/HL9SB/
[02:48:45] <juria_roberts> heyy  can any1 guide me 2 a css irc?
[02:48:56] <pr0ton> juria_roberts, #css
[02:49:17] <juria_roberts> pr0ton: thanks
[02:49:29] <pr0ton> D_INS, there are some problems
[02:49:39] <pr0ton> firstly you're including jquery_mobile too early
[02:49:42] <pr0ton> i see this in console
[02:49:59] <pr0ton> Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[02:50:00] <pr0ton> fiddle.jshell.net:70Uncaught ReferenceError: initialize is not defined
[02:50:18] <pr0ton> don't you have to include jquery mobile afterwards or something?
[02:50:37] <pr0ton> another problem is
[02:50:54] <pr0ton> that you dont need onload="initialize();"
[02:50:59] <pr0ton> that function is not in global scope
[02:51:26] <pr0ton> oh sorry, it is
[02:52:36] <_axx> Hey everyone :) Just a simple question, if i have something link $('.item').html(); how can i select items from the html afterwards?
[02:53:02] <_axx> .item hast something links <div class="item"><h1>Welcome</h1><span class="welcome">Hello World</span></div>
[02:53:10] <_axx> links = like
[02:53:40] <pr0ton> D_INS, no ; after mapOptions
[02:53:47] <pr0ton> myOptions **
[02:54:02] <pr0ton> shouldnt matter thought, JS does some retarded thing of adding ;s
[02:55:18] <D_INS> proton: i change the order of jquery and jqerymobile.js but this not help, also add ; after myOptions
[02:55:41] <pr0ton> D_INS, yeah
[02:55:43] <pr0ton> wait let me see
[02:56:33] <pr0ton> got it
[02:57:07] <pr0ton> http://jsfiddle.net/HL9SB/2/
[02:57:17] <pr0ton> you've to set a style on the map_canvas div
[02:57:21] <pr0ton> specifying a height and width
[02:57:38] <pr0ton> either through an inline style or through a predefined CSS rule (class / id etc)
[02:58:03] <D_INS> 10x proton, but how to make 100% width and height
[02:58:05] <silv3r_m00n> is there a method to clear all inputs of a form ?
[02:58:19] <pr0ton> width:100%; height:100%;
[02:58:43] <pr0ton> oh wait.
[02:59:22] <pr0ton> D_INS, i think you've to mention height manually
[02:59:26] <pr0ton> width maybe a %
[02:59:30] <pr0ton> not sure, ask on #css
[02:59:39] <D_INS> 10x proton
[03:00:22] <pr0ton> what is 10x ?
[03:00:27] <D_INS> thanks :)
[03:00:37] <pr0ton> ok, np
[03:02:19] <pr0ton> what is the event when a user is typing in the input field?
[03:02:28] <pr0ton> focus and unfocus dont work that well
[03:03:51] <JimXL> onkeyup maybe?
[03:04:15] <silv3r_m00n> hi there form1 is a form element , form1.reset() is not clearing the form , any idea why ?
[03:04:47] <coldhead> maybe your premise is flawed
[03:05:25] <silv3r_m00n> coldhead: me ?
[03:05:57] <coldhead> no, your premise
[03:06:03] <coldhead> maybe form1 isn't really a form
[03:06:18] <silv3r_m00n> it was created like this >> var $form = $(elem).closest('form')
[03:06:26] <silv3r_m00n> where elem is a input tag
[03:07:13] <dmarkey> is there a way to set up a universal handler when a $.post or $.get returns a 500
[03:07:24] <silv3r_m00n> its a jquery object
[03:08:23] <JimXL> Clearing form is a bit tricky.  Suggest you use the jQuery form plugin and use its clearForm or resetForm functionality. It takes care of most of the corner cases.
[03:08:45] <JimXL> s/form/forms/
[03:09:03] <silv3r_m00n> JimXL: why doesn't the reset function work ?
[03:09:35] <coldhead> you need to use $form[0].reset()
[03:09:43] <coldhead> or $form.get(0).reset()
[03:09:54] <JimXL> It doesn't handle all elements well.
[03:09:55] <coldhead> to get at the actual DOM element's method
[03:10:12] <silv3r_m00n> hmm
[03:10:16] <silv3r_m00n> ok
[03:10:34] <JimXL> Besides coldhead is correct.
[03:10:53] <silv3r_m00n> JimXL: so isn't that a better approach than using the plugin ?
[03:11:13] <JimXL> If it works, yes but for some form elements it doesn't work as well.
[03:12:10] <coldhead> it's better to avoid forms all together :)
[03:14:19] <silv3r_m00n> JimXL: like which ones ?
[03:14:21] <silv3r_m00n> coldhead: why ?
[03:15:00] <JimXL> I don't know for sure, I've just read that somewhere.
[03:15:07] <coldhead> because they can be tricky!
[03:15:09] <TeddyMurray> what does maximum call stack exceeded mean?
[03:15:09] <JimXL> Didn't question the source.
[03:15:15] <TeddyMurray> infinite loop of some sort?
[03:15:21] <JimXL> Possible recursion.
[03:16:03] <x29a> hi people, is it possible (using jquery) to prepare some textfile and send it to the user to download? one would need to set headers to octet or something, then present the file. or other possibilities to "export" data?
[03:16:32] <TeddyMurray> is there a way to see what methods its recusring through
[03:16:42] <x29a> debugger, breakpoint
[03:16:49] <JimXL> firebug.
[03:25:44] <silv3r_m00n> coldhead: forms are tricky ? what to use then ?
[03:26:00] <gizero> Hi. I'm trying to call .button() on all buttons in a specific form. Why isn't this working: $("#myForm :button").button()?
[03:26:39] <nail_> x29a: I don't think that's possible with pure javascript, but you can take a look at https://github.com/dcneiner/Downloadify
[03:26:42] <mattp_> why is there no job board on the jquery.com site!
[03:27:21] <x29a> nail_: ya, stumbled over that already. also, one can create a dataURI, but that is bound to the GET limits
[03:27:46] <x29a> nail_: i guess im bound to a server then for my export feature, thanks though
[03:37:52] <adioe3> does anybody know how do i extend a widget's _create() method (i.e. also calling the original _create() alongside the new one) ?
[03:39:51] <Cork> adioe3: save the original function in an internal variable
[03:41:14] <adioe3> Cork, well, overriding _init() seems to work fine so I don't know if I should bother with that.
[03:41:55] <enoj> hey guys - do you know if it is possible to bind an event for "ctrl+f" hotkey? I need to expand some divs in order to show some more text that should be searchable in the browsers on-page search
[03:41:57] <Cork> adioe3: it depends on when you want your code to execute
[03:42:07] <Cork> adioe3: as those don't have the exact same meaning
[03:43:27] <adioe3> Cork, I'm trying to extend the slider widget and would like to add some more code to the creation function (i.e. i want it to add some input boxes for the values)
[03:45:04] <Cork> adioe3: well that sounds like the _create is where it belongs
[03:45:37] <Cork> adioe3: as the _create event happens before _init, so you would send the create event before everything is there
[03:46:24] <adioe3> Cork, ok, but how do I call the old _create() method and then add my code?
[03:46:38] <adioe3> because I want to add stuff after the slider is created
[03:48:07] <Cork> adioe3: var org_create = $.ui.slider.prototype._create; $.extend(true, $ui.slider.prototype, { _create: function() { org_create(); } });
[03:48:27] <Cork> (don't forget your plugin wrapper around that)
[03:48:49] <Cork> that is (function($) { })(jQuery);
[03:49:50] <adioe3> ok, thanks
[03:51:17] <Cork> adioe3: you can remove the "true, " in the extend call if you never add objects to the prototype
[03:51:23] <Cork> (most likly you don't)
[03:54:21] <TeddyMurray> hi, im getting maximum stack call http://pastebin.com/wFWUSFSg -- i know why its doing it
[03:54:28] <TeddyMurray> but im not sure how to get that functionality without becoming recursive
[03:54:37] <TeddyMurray> if a tab is clicked, it needs to update the slider
[03:54:46] <TeddyMurray> if the slider is slid, or value changed, it needs to update the tab
[03:55:41] <Cork> TeddyMurray: you have to make sure the slited is initiated before you call "value"
[03:55:57] <Cork> *slider
[03:56:20] <TeddyMurray> it is initialized
[03:56:29] <Hooloovoo> Hehe i just got a maximum stack call too. I ignored it cause it works. =P
[03:56:50] <TeddyMurray> Hooloovoo, mine stops execution, what browser?
[03:57:12] <TeddyMurray> Cork, it is initialized cause that line isn't called till later in the script
[03:57:17] <Hooloovoo> chrome
[03:57:33] <silv3r_m00n> I want to add a method to a dom object , is this wrong >> elem.redraw = function() { ...... }  ?
[03:57:38] <Hooloovoo> I don't have a clue what it even means and i don't get it in FF.
[03:57:41] <silv3r_m00n> I later try to call it like elem.redraw();
[03:57:52] <TeddyMurray> it means two methods
[03:57:55] <TeddyMurray> keep playing tag with each other
[03:58:04] <TeddyMurray> recursion
[03:58:18] <Hooloovoo> silv3r_m00n: Looks good.
[03:58:31] <silv3r_m00n> Hooloovoo: but it doesn't work :(
[03:58:35] <TeddyMurray> a() { b(); } b() { a(); } -- recursion
[03:58:35] <TeddyMurray> :P
[03:58:38] <Hooloovoo> TeddyMurray: Ahh i see.
[03:58:48] <silv3r_m00n> TeddyMurray: me ?
[03:58:52] <Hooloovoo> silv3r_m00n: You have some code?
[03:58:54] <TeddyMurray> no silv3r_m00n sorry
[03:58:56] <TeddyMurray> not you
[03:58:57] <TeddyMurray> XD
[03:59:01] <silv3r_m00n> oh
[03:59:26] <TeddyMurray> silv3r_m00n, you mean like using classes in javascript?
[03:59:42] <silv3r_m00n> my code is something like this http://codepad.org/6uNl6EOb
[03:59:50] <TeddyMurray> i dont think you can put it on the DOM object, i think you need a javascript object
[03:59:52] <silv3r_m00n> next thing is elem.redraw();
[03:59:55] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: never add functions to the doom
[04:00:00] <Cork> *dom
[04:00:04] <silv3r_m00n> then what should I do ?
[04:00:05] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: use .data
[04:00:10] <Cork> ?.data
[04:00:16] <silv3r_m00n> can we store functions using data ?
[04:00:18] <silv3r_m00n> example ?
[04:00:24] <Cork> sure
[04:00:46] <Cork> $(select).data('my_func', function() {}); $(select).data('my_func')();
[04:00:51] <Hooloovoo> Cork: Why can't you extend the jquery functions?
[04:01:04] <silv3r_m00n> let me try
[04:01:04] <Cork> Hooloovoo: yes but that would be global
[04:01:14] <Cork> cause each time you run $() it creates a new instance
[04:01:24] <Cork> so a function added to the selector will be lost
[04:01:26] <Hooloovoo> Cork: But what about using the sub() function?
[04:01:49] <Cork> Hooloovoo: sub?
[04:02:05] <Hooloovoo> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.sub/
[04:04:16] <Cork> Hooloovoo: well its still the same
[04:04:29] <Cork> it would still be global for all elements used with that selector
[04:04:45] <Cork> Hooloovoo: if you use .data it will belong to that specific element
[04:04:57] <Cork> so not the same usage senario
[04:05:40] <Cork> actually i don't really see the need for that function
[04:06:13] <Cork> either its global or not, why create a separat function with some additional prototype functions
[04:07:18] <silv3r_m00n> Cork : by the way , why should I add functions directly to DOM ?
[04:07:33] <Cork> cause it might cause leakages
[04:07:40] <Cork> and its bad coding standards
[04:08:33] <Cork> thats why jquery exists the way it is, and not like some other calls functions directly on the dom
[04:08:44] <Cork> *other frameworks and calls
[04:11:44] <silv3r_m00n> hmm ok
[04:22:23] <kostodo> How can I say "hide" all children of "foo" other than child x
[04:22:24] <kostodo> ?
[04:26:00] <pr0ton> whats the best plugin for doing slideshows?
[04:27:07] <kostodo> pr0ton: .cycle
[04:27:33] <pr0ton> kostodo thanks, i will take a look
[04:28:21] <pr0ton> kostodo, i want like, left and right buttons
[04:29:33] <pr0ton> ok, all is good
[04:51:45] <Paveloosha> Hi.. how to detect divs whose attribute rel='something' ?
[04:52:53] <enoj> hey guys - do you know if it is possible to bind an event for "ctrl+f" hotkey? I need to expand some divs in order to show some more text that should be searchable in the browsers on-page search
[04:53:36] <Paveloosha> is it possible?
[04:54:32] <D_INS> Hi again, I have one more quesion. When I open my page directly, this works fine, but when i open this page from somewehre ( by using $mobile.changepage..) it says that 'initialize is not defined'. my code is         $('.sss').live('pageshow', function (event, ui) {
[04:54:32] <D_INS> 			initialize();
[04:54:32] <D_INS>         });
[04:56:36] <Paveloosha> Got it guys.. $("div[rel='something']") .. :)
[04:56:41] <Paveloosha> nice
[04:59:08] <Paveloosha> Now another question arises.. how to detect whose attribute not equal to 'something' ?
[04:59:16] <scott_nz> hi all, weird IE thing happening with jQuery selectors and video tag. following gist shows what is going wrong https://gist.github.com/1097054.  what am i miss understanding?
[05:00:04] <scott_nz> Paveloosha: :not
[05:01:53] <Paveloosha> syntex?
[05:02:36] <scott_nz> Paveloosha: http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[05:02:49] <Paveloosha> Thanks scott_nz :)
[05:03:04] <scott_nz> Paveloosha: you want to apply to the set of elements that do equal
[05:04:00] <schmuu> i have a big big string and i want to hold the text-part after the simple word "found wordlwide:"
[05:04:04] <schmuu> how can i do that?
[05:05:38] <Black> Hello all
[05:05:43] <Jakey> no
[05:05:52] <Cork> schmuu: regex match
[05:05:54] <Jakey> i don't like heelo
[05:06:18] <Paveloosha> scott_nz, a little confusion.. will it be $('div:not[:"something"') ?
[05:06:20] <schmuu> Cork: can u show me the regex for this?
[05:06:51] <Paveloosha> or $('div:not[:rel')?
[05:07:22] <Black> Jakey: everyone's problems :)
[05:07:48] <D_INS> can somebody help me pls?
[05:07:57] <Cork> schmuu: your_string.match(/found wordlwide:([^ ]+)/)
[05:08:10] <Cork> it will give you an array with the matches
[05:08:35] <scott_nz> Paveloosha: you may want .not()
[05:08:52] <scott_nz> Paveloosha: all things but not the ones that match
[05:09:16] <Cork> schmuu: btw if it can accure multible time add g after the last /
[05:09:40] <schmuu> ok
[05:09:56] <Cork> schmuu: btw that will match things like found wordlwide:hello
[05:10:03] <Cork> not found wordlwide: hello
[05:10:16] <schmuu> an when i want to get the part bevore found worldwide?
[05:10:18] <Paveloosha> suppose all the $('.myDiv') whose attribute 'rel' not equal to 'something' ..
[05:10:36] <Paveloosha> scott_nz,
[05:10:36] <Cork> schmuu: thats actually harder
[05:10:41] <schmuu> hm
[05:10:53] <Flynsarmy> is jquery mobile worth using yet or still too buggy?
[05:11:33] <Black> I would like to use jQuery tooltip plugin to turn to titles in Tip acronym tags (titles contain the html directly), so I tried: "$("#caca[title]").tooltip();" but it blocks all JQuery in my page, is this normal? For your help, by advance, thanks
[05:11:38] <Jakey> yes its useable Flying_Cow
[05:11:42] <Jakey> yes its useable Flynsarmy
[05:11:53] <Flynsarmy> Jakey: any noticable bugs?
[05:11:56] <scott_nz> Paveloosha: $(parent).children().not('rel[something]')  might be one way
[05:12:03] <Jakey> no Flynsarmy
[05:12:13] <scott_nz> Paveloosha: try a few things out like that
[05:12:22] <schmuu> Cork: can u get rid of it?
[05:12:31] <Paveloosha> okay, trying..
[05:12:57] * Flying_Cow looks at the blinking mIRC window.
[05:13:28] <TeddyMurray> $('.edit-scroll-menu').find('li')
[05:13:31] <TeddyMurray> is this correct syntax?
[05:13:36] <TeddyMurray> err
[05:13:37] <TeddyMurray> $('.edit-scroll-menu').find('li').each(function(){ alert($(this).val()); });
[05:13:47] <TeddyMurray> or would it be .html() maybe?
[05:15:23] <Paveloosha> <scott_nz>, I am using it like this.. $('.tourdiv').not('rel[open]').hide(); ............. It is hiding all the $('.tourdiv') ..
[05:15:45] <gizero> I'm trying to call .button() on all buttons in a specific form. Why isn't this working: $("#myForm :button").button()?
[05:17:20] <si458> hi people
[05:17:31] <schmuu> Cork?
[05:17:33] <si458> i cant seem to get the .load working with ie9
[05:17:41] <si458> is the an issue with jquery and ie9 :s
[05:17:45] <Cork> schmuu: ya?
[05:18:01] <schmuu> did you know that too?
[05:18:44] <Cork> schmuu: look ahead is more time then i can spend on a regex statement right now sorry
[05:19:07] <schmuu> k
[05:19:14] <si458> when i issue the .load to a div ('#mainpage').load('menu/main.php'), it is just blank? but in firefox, chrome it displays!
[05:19:18] <si458> what am i doing wrong???
[05:19:26] <Cork> schmuu: but thats what you want regex look ahead
[05:19:53] <schmuu> yes, thx
[05:20:42] <Cork> schmuu: btw one more question
[05:20:58] <Cork> schmuu: by before did you mean before the find word?
[05:21:05] <Cork> or include the text?
[05:21:16] <schmuu> before
[05:21:18] <Paveloosha> $(".tourdiv[rel='open']") .......... This is working... what if I need the opposite like not equal to "open" ?
[05:21:32] <motaka2> is this cause an image to stream from server?   $("div#draw").html('<img src="'+imgPaths.line+'"/>');
[05:22:04] <Cork> motaka2: that causes the browser to load an image file from the server ya
[05:22:13] <Cork> not really stream though
[05:22:33] <motaka2> Cork: But I cant see the image
[05:22:52] <Cork> motaka2: is the path correct
[05:23:01] <Cork> look in the net tab of your debugger and see
[05:23:05] <Paveloosha> wooooooooooops.. I got it ... we can use "!=" to do that...
[05:23:06] <Cork> (and check what happens in the dom)
[05:23:37] <si458> its ok ive fixed my bug :)
[05:23:47] <si458> just updated my jquery and suddenly started working ???
[05:23:49] <si458> :s
[05:25:51] <motaka2> Cork: You where right Instead of giving the url I was givin the real path as src
[05:31:03] <nail_> schmuu: .match(/(?:(.*?)\s*)?found worldwide:\s*(.*)/) , so for "foo bar found worldwide: baz quux" you'll have "foo bar" in [1] and "baz quux" in [2], and for "found worldwide: baz quux", that will be undefined in [1] and "baz quux" in [2]
[05:33:08] <schmuu> nail_: great
[05:36:34] <TeddyMurray> does anyone know how to hide the tab menu in jquery tabs?
[05:36:36] <TeddyMurray> jqueryui*
[05:38:05] <nail_> $('.ui-tabs-nav').hide() ? not sure if that's what you meant
[05:39:59] <TeddyMurray> maybe!
[05:40:00] <TeddyMurray> lets see!
[05:40:01] <TeddyMurray> ;D
[05:44:28] <GeO`> hey guys
[05:44:36] <GeO`> I am facing a bug with jquery UI effect shake

[05:44:59] <GeO`> click a couple of times on the square, and its position will be reset to 0,0
[05:45:13] <GeO`> you have to click while it's shaking
[05:46:16] <grkblood13> im currently using this code to toggle certain divs where $i is a number but this code isnt dynamic at all because I have to have one of these scripts listed for each div, is there a way to use regex to make it so that I only have to list the script once? http://pastebin.com/iU0Giu4X
[05:47:29] <coachz> I have a page with a lot of drop downs with class "foo".  Is there a way I can set the background color of the ones that have value "Test"  ?
[05:48:07] <nail_> GeO`: I'm not sure about the bug, but http://jsfiddle.net/TAMCG/1/ fixes this as it won't be able to cumulate clicks
[05:49:07] <GeO`> thanks ill look into one(), I didn't know about it
[05:51:32] <motaka2> console.log(clickedObj); gives me  [div#id_shls_1841.selected-units-items] in firebug , how can I get 1841 out of it ?
[05:51:39] <JSM87> Hi, I have a form which has some code to run in onsubmit="RUN CODE HERE". How can i using jquery remove what ever is currently set to run in the onsubmit="" and replace it with some new code to run?
[05:52:03] <JSM87> I tried attr('onsubmit') but that didnt work
[05:52:38] <Cork> JSM87: unbind('submit')
[05:53:07] <motaka2> no answer?
[05:53:14] <JSM87> Cork: So like this $("#managePagesForm").unbind('submit').submit(function(e) {NEW CODE
[05:53:16] <grkblood13> anyone?
[05:54:05] <eml> I'm hiding and showing some content inside a container. $().children('.message_container').detach(); (also tried .hide())  and then showing using $().append('lots of html'); This all works fine except that in the now detached content there was <a link>Some stuff</a>. When I hover over the area where that link was I still get a new cursor and clicking on that area follows the link. Ideas?
[05:54:15] <Cork> JSM87: yes
[05:55:26] <motaka2> Cork ?
[05:55:48] <mdeboard`> Is there a idiomatic way of doing nested $.each iterations
[05:56:07] <JSM87> Cork: That doesnt seem to be working...
[05:56:16] <coachz> How can I loop through all my selects that have class "foo" and change BG color of those with value "test" please
[05:56:20] <JSM87> After I rnu the unbind submit, the onsubmit that was originally there is still running
[05:56:25] <eml> I'm so stupid. nevermind.
[05:56:26] <JimXL> motaka2 Use a regular expression possibly
[05:56:56] <coachz> do i use .each() ?
[05:56:59] <motaka2> JimXL: the current problem is to find the id ogfthe element
[05:57:26] <JimXL> coachz  var ar = $('.foo'); will give you an array of all lists with that id.  Then loop through them.
[05:57:51] <coachz> it's a class
[05:57:56] <coachz> same thing ?
[05:58:05] <JimXL> sorry I meant class
[05:58:07] <scott_nz> ANyone have any ideas why IE isn't being stupid with css selectors with video tags? https://gist.github.com/1097054
[05:58:08] <JimXL> Not id.
[05:58:10] <keir> JSM87L use $('select.foo').each()
[05:58:24] <coachz> keir,  that's my question
[05:58:37] <keir> sorry
[05:58:38] <keir> lol
[05:58:56] <mdeboard`> Is there a idiomatic way of doing nested $.each iterations, e.g. http://dpaste.com/573234/
[05:59:19] <JimXL> motaka2 try alert(clickedObj.id);
[05:59:24] <mdeboard`> where logDates is a nested array i.e. [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]]
[05:59:58] <motaka2> JimXL: what about this one?  clickedObj.attr("id");
[06:00:08] <JimXL> Maybe, try it.
[06:00:22] <keir> but yes something like $('select.foo').each(function(){ var abc = $(this).val(); if ( abc = test ) { $(this).css('background-color', '#000000') }; });
[06:00:26] <JimXL> Depends on how you got the clickedObj
[06:01:12] <JimXL> do a console.dir(clickedObj) and see if it has and id property
[06:01:47] <coachz> keir, if i use    $('select.foo').each()    how do i set the BG color of it if it has value "test" please
[06:02:10] <JimXL> coachz look up about 5 lines
[06:02:11] <motaka2> JimXL: alert(clickedObj.id); gives me undefined : this is clicked object , when I click on anobject , the handler does thsis :  click =function(){removeThis($(this))}
[06:02:25] <coachz> thx !
[06:02:40] <keir> i just gave you the code coachz
[06:02:43] <motaka2> JimXL: So I thinck clickedobj is a jquery object
[06:02:47] <keir> $('select.foo').each(function(){ var abc = $(this).val(); if ( abc = test ) { $(this).css('background-color', '#000000') }; });
[06:02:50] <coachz> testing now,  you guys rock
[06:03:15] <JimXL> OK
[06:03:29] <keir> one point, put ' ' around test
[06:03:35] <coachz> k
[06:04:54] <keir> and obviously change '#000000' to whatever colour you'd like :P
[06:04:55] <nail_> and == :)
[06:05:21] <burg> hello. if there are 10 siblings in a container, and i click on a sibling, how can i know which one is? (like nth sibling)
[06:05:49] <coachz> yes
[06:06:09] <JimXL> motaka2 check out this: http://jsfiddle.net/kYfkg/1/
[06:06:33] <nail_> burg: .index()
[06:06:45] <JimXL> burg give them each a unique id is one way
[06:06:59] <motaka2> JimXL: thank you i have the problem solved the new problem is to find something like php explode in jquery
[06:07:43] <JimXL> use split

[06:10:09] <ksk239> $('#container').append($('<div id="row'+i'"></div>);
[06:10:23] <ksk239> how do i do this/
[06:11:17] <motaka2> JimXL: thank you
[06:11:18] <KuW8t> i have to parse a special table out of an HTML stack. im new in jquery. whats the best way here?
[06:12:01] <motaka2> how to unset an element of an array in jquery ?
[06:13:04] <JimXL> ksd239, first learn to use paste, then consider the DOM methods document.createElement, document.createTextNode, etc.
[06:13:53] <Anticom> KuW8t simply give the table a class then you can select it using $('.tableclass').children('tr' /*would be the rows*/).children('td')
[06:14:32] <nail_> motaka2: to "unset" as in "set as undefined" use delete, to "unset" as in "remove", use .splice (that's pure js, not jquery)
[06:15:14] <KuW8t> Anticom: only the first td have a class name
[06:15:22] <motaka2> nail_ i look for a way to remove an element of an array , does jquery have an API for that ?
[06:15:44] <Anticom> then simply use $('.classOfYourTds')
[06:15:50] <Anticom> .html() to get the content
[06:15:59] <Anticom> .html(content) to set it
[06:16:16] <JimXL> motaka2 no need for a jquery API since javascript does it
[06:16:44] <motaka2> JimXL: Thank you , i have it done using javascript
[06:16:44] <KuW8t> yes but my problem is that not every td have this class name
[06:16:48] <motaka2> splice
[06:16:50] <JimXL> jquery doesn't try to duplicate the functionality of javascript unneccessarly.
[06:16:54] <KuW8t> i need to get children back
[06:17:11] <KuW8t> and take the table
[06:18:09] <KuW8t> parent
[06:20:01] <KuW8t> Anticom: $('.classOfTheFirstTd').parent().parent().html(htmlString) like this?
[06:20:28] <Anticom> that would replace the whole table with htmlString
[06:20:40] <KuW8t> oh
[06:21:10] <KuW8t> htmlString is my HTML stack
[06:22:59] <donCams> hi. I have searched far and wide but I haven't found the answer. I want to preload an external html page into an iframe inside a hidden div. When it's done loading, I will perform some animation then display that hidden div with its contents. anybody got an idea how to do this?
[06:25:40] <D_INS> Question: When using $.mobile.changePage , the function that i want to exectue onload is not executing
[06:27:24] <Aamir> D_INS:  ask in #jquerymobile

[06:35:07] <erichynds> NCS_One: the same one you call it on
[06:36:13] <Anticom> KuW8t just tell me what you want to do
[06:36:28] <KuW8t> ok

[06:36:45] <KuW8t> ^^
[06:39:25] <NCS_One> erichynds: thanks
[06:39:44] <KuW8t> i have an htmlString, there is an table with no classname. but the first td have a classname. i want to get the hole table.
[06:39:56] <KuW8t> Anticom: this is what i want in short
[06:40:01] <Woet> KuW8t: http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[06:40:11] <Woet> oh, i'm sorry, i didn't read your messages above
[06:40:12] <Woet> ignore me
[06:40:22] <NCS_One> is there a way to determine the action toggle() made?
[06:40:35] <KuW8t> Woet: yes but i think too that parent is an solution here
[06:45:22] <freakyfractal> i'm getting a weird error.. only in firefox. i'm using ajax to $.post() to a script that checks if username is available. it works in chrome, but not in firefox... firebug console: registration_form is not defined ----- but it is!
[06:46:05] <grkblood13> where does this code need to go to use it? http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/regex-selector-for-jquery/
[06:46:06] <freakyfractal> the post data is: { username: registration_form.username.value }
[06:46:55] <jbrokc> using the hotkeys plugin (https://github.com/jeresig/jquery.hotkeys), how do i bind an action to a key being *held*? keypress != holding a key
[06:50:31] <JimXL> freakyfractal Why don't you reference it with a jquery selector
[06:53:46] <freakyfractal> JimXL: let me see... OK.
[06:53:58] <freakyfractal> thanks.
[06:54:24] <dbugger> hey guys. If I click a menu full of <li><a>...</a></li> and id like to find out when i click on a <a>, in which position the <li> is inside the list. how can I do that??
[06:55:34] <dbugger> Ive tried making "$.inArray($(this).parent(), $(this).parent().siblings());", but it doesnt work :(
[06:59:20] <keir> have you tried using index() ?
[07:03:36] <keir> try something like > $('li > a').click(function() {  	var position = $(this).parent('li'); 	alert('Index: ' + position.index($('ul')) + ');  });
[07:05:35] <k0rnel> hey guys. someone using -o-transition in opera?
[07:05:45] <k0rnel> http://jsfiddle.net/Af2Gy/1/ doesn't work for me
[07:06:01] <Segaja> hi, how can i get the amount of elements in a json object?
[07:08:10] <Segaja> ah never mind my question
[07:09:32] <keir> dbugger: check this out, is this what you need? http://jsfiddle.net/CuU9F/
[07:10:23] <dbugger> keir, it doesnt work :S
[07:10:28] <keir> what do you get?
[07:10:33] <dbugger> nothing
[07:10:34] <dbugger> no alert box :d
[07:10:48] <keir> try this sorry maybe i didnt update :P
[07:10:49] <keir> http://jsfiddle.net/CuU9F/1/
[07:11:57] <keir> is it working?
[07:12:18] <dbugger> lol
[07:12:19] <dbugger> so easy :D
[07:12:21] <dbugger> thanks :D
[07:12:27] <keir>  :) no problem
[07:12:55] <jbrokc> why doesn't this work like i think it should? $.each(".foo", function (index, value) { console.log "hello!"; });   ?
[07:13:21] <keir> it looks like you are using the function before selector?
[07:13:38] <jbrokc> oh, i know why
[07:13:39] <keir> surely it should be $('.foo').each(function..
[07:14:25] <nail_> and you miss () around "hello"
[07:14:43] <jbrokc> yeah
[07:15:12] <jbrokc> how do i get a boolean value for checking the value of an attribute? that  is $(el).isAttribute("height", "20px") ?
[07:15:43] <keir> ah sorry $.each() is not the same as $(selector).each() :P
[07:18:02] <jbrokc> is there a variation of attr that returns a boolean?
[07:18:03] <coachz> keir, i finally wade through my coworkers code to set the BG color.  The BG is being set for all values though my console.log shows different numeric values.   https://gist.github.com/e4cdd67278b27274b7e5
[07:19:49] <keir> just put an if around the attr selector?
[07:19:49] <coachz> it should only set the BG color when the value is '3'
[07:20:00] <keir> coachz: is that not happening?
[07:20:09] <coachz> it's setting for all values
[07:20:52] <keir> do you have a live example I could see?
[07:21:03] <coachz> i don't, this site is a site from hell
[07:21:29] <coachz> this looks right though ?      https://gist.github.com/e4cdd67278b27274b7e5
[07:22:12] <keir> ah i think you need if ( abc == '3' )
[07:22:27] <coachz> sec phone
[07:23:06] <keir> you have if( abc = '3' )
[07:24:04] <dbugger> if I make a fadeOut on an array of elements, and I want to call a function ONE TIME in the call back, how can I do it??
[07:25:48] <coachz> fixed it
[07:25:52] <coachz> nicely done sir keir
[07:25:57] <coachz> thanks a lot
[07:25:59] <keir> coachz: haha your welcome :)
[07:26:24] <coachz> very appreciated
[07:27:46] <cub> hey
[07:27:50] <keir> can you give example of your fadeout code dbugger?
[07:28:19] <dbugger> $("div").fadeOut(function() { call_me_only_once(); });

[07:35:03] <atrigent> and I've been able to do it when no mouse buttons are being held down
[07:35:19] <atrigent> but it doesn't seem to work when the left mouse button is being held down (i.e. something is being dragged)
[07:35:27] <keir> cub: what is happening
[07:35:49] <cub> i think i know what it is
[07:36:08] <cub> that visible element stuff only works for toggle
[07:36:09] <cub> i guess
[07:36:18] <cub> when i set it to toggle it sets to hidden or shown
[07:36:25] <cub> Even though i was already doing that
[07:36:28] <KuW8t> data = $('.TextMBlack').parents('table:first').html(data);
[07:36:33] <cub> with hide() ad show()

[07:36:48] <KuW8t> both no result
[07:39:42] <cub> figured it out
[07:39:48] <cub> nobody helps in this channel though, loL anyway bye
[07:46:16] <nail_> atrigent: I think mouseleave will only be triggered when you release the button, if you want something to launch at the very moment the mouse leave (while the button is pressed), you could bind to "mousemove" and check whenever e.pageX or e.pageY goes negative
[07:46:51] <nail_> but that's an expensive handler
[07:46:59] <atrigent> nail_: yeah, I did try that and it does work
[07:47:09] <atrigent> but yeah, I was just wondering whether there's a better way
[07:47:15] <atrigent> I mean, I have to handle mousemove anyway
[07:47:26] <atrigent> so it's not too bad
[07:48:31] <atrigent> kinda dumb that it doesn't get fired when the button is held down though
[07:49:00] <grkblood13> how do i return the numerical portion of this regex? http://pastebin.com/wf4zPWtV
[07:49:12] <grkblood13> c1 is where im trying to do it
[07:50:46] <dethkrieg> grkblood13, although i dont have an answer, this site is helpful for testing: http://gskinner.com/RegExr/
[07:50:56] <dethkrieg> it lets you test regex real time
[07:51:41] <grkblood13> id*
[07:51:46] <grkblood13> the regex isnt the problem i dont think, its the handleing of the captured it
[07:51:58] <grkblood13> i dont know how to pass the current id
[07:52:42] <dethkrieg> in your code, '#userstatus_+c1' does not resolve the value of c1
[07:52:48] <jbrokc> in a jquery object, how do I get rid of any child nodes within the parent element?
[07:52:51] <dethkrieg> wouldn't you need to take c1 out of quotes?
[07:52:51] <oxez> well nvm I figured it out, apparently 'item' is a reserved keyword or somethinig in IE
[07:52:55] <phlp> ?js "UserList_123".match(/^UserList_([0-9]+)/)
[07:52:56] <bot-t> phlp: ["UserList_123", "123"]

[07:57:00] <grkblood13> its saying the id is undefined
[07:57:29] <grkblood13> i think i got it

[07:59:10] <shesek> When using deferred.pipe, what's the recommended way to change a resolved status to a reject status?

[08:02:07] <BillCriswell> grkblood13: matches = 'test_123'.match(/(\d+)$/); then matches[0] will have the 123.
[08:03:46] <grkblood13> i forgot to add 'this' this.id works

[08:09:19] <aot2002> Ahhh
[08:09:20] <jmanley501> the documentation for the tabs needs to be updated to remove the spinner section or at least say it doesn't work with 1.18.14
[08:09:23] <sadmicrowave> :)
[08:09:41] <jmanley501> so how does one do a spinner or loading.... in 1.8.14
[08:10:02] <aot2002> But you do realize that I'm hovering a link which is changing the object bar above it... so references to this will change what's hover'd
[08:10:39] <aot2002> sadmicrowave,
[08:11:01] <seutje> $(this).prev() ?
[08:11:36] <sadmicrowave> aot2002, I did not realize this...which object bar are you talking about in your fiddle?
[08:11:59] <aot2002> menuHomeBar gets changed when menuHome link is hovered
[08:12:01] <seutje> the mouseout uses the key
[08:12:07] <aot2002> Hence why I was referencing each object
[08:12:59] <aaronfay> Has anyone seen anything in jQuery that will behave like the SelectButtonView seen here: http://demo.sproutcore.com/sample_controls/ (under 'Panes')
[08:13:27] <seutje> aot2002: why are u using HRs?
[08:13:38] <seutje> aot2002: why not just give the elements a top border?
[08:13:48] <sadmicrowave> aot2002, in your html you could add ref='' attributes to your tags and inside your callback do a css change on the reference tag
[08:13:49] <seutje> you could just ditch the table altogether then
[08:13:54] <aot2002> uhh cause I'm an idiot
[08:14:14] <sadmicrowave> lol
[08:14:15] <seutje> oh, I see
[08:14:21] <aot2002> lol
[08:14:23] <seutje> carry on
[08:14:46] <BillCriswell> You just have to traverse the dom. Say you have <ul><li id="one">One</li><li id="two">Two</li></ul> and you do $('#two').hover() if you want to access #one you can do $(this).prev() to access one or $(this).next() to access #three
[08:15:07] <aot2002> ahh nice
[08:16:59] <sadmicrowave> aot2002, I don't even see what you are trying to change displaying in your fiddle results pane...
[08:17:19] <aot2002> It's a bar that sits above the link
[08:17:36] <sadmicrowave> and you want it to turn green whenever any of the links get hovered on?
[08:17:43] <aot2002> yes
[08:17:49] <sadmicrowave> omg
[08:17:50] <aot2002> I didn't add css formatting for the bar
[08:18:15] <aot2002> I'm going to change to the top border
[08:18:28] <sadmicrowave> it doesn't matter you can leave it if you want
[08:19:00] <sadmicrowave> actually no, change it to top border, that would make much more sense
[08:19:44] <BillCriswell> aot2002: You're using an <hr> in a table cell above another to create a top border?
[08:19:55] <sadmicrowave> yes he is
[08:20:07] <seutje> aot2002: this what ur after? http://jsfiddle.net/evxvS/
[08:20:19] <BillCriswell> aot2002: Damn dude.
[08:20:28] <seutje> sry I didn't use javascript though
[08:20:37] <aot2002> seutje,  That is exactly what I need
[08:20:52] <seutje> why u gotta make it so hard on urself?
[08:20:58] <seutje> (and the browsers trying to render it)
[08:22:25] <aot2002> seutje, ha I wish I knew I started with just css and then no one could answer how to do it in the css channel
[08:22:40] <aot2002> so I reached for jquery assuming it couldn't be done
[08:22:56] <BillCriswell> aot2002: Are you sure you asked in #css?
[08:23:05] <aot2002> Yes a few days ago
[08:23:40] <sadmicrowave> aot2002, here it is with js http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/PCx8S/2/
[08:24:17] <sadmicrowave> incase you wanted both methods
[08:25:00] <seutje> aot2002: the css channel is almost as worthless as the php channel, and that's saying a lot!
[08:25:15] <sadmicrowave> lol seutje++
[08:25:51] <seutje> no place like #jQuery :')
[08:26:24] <sadmicrowave> gay
[08:27:11] <sadmicrowave> :P
[08:27:17] <seutje> hmz, my clearfix was lacking content, not that a clearfix is rly needed here http://jsfiddle.net/evxvS/1/
[08:28:28] <aot2002> it's sad that that channel has gown down the drain thank you all for the details wow impressive
[08:29:27] <seutje> aot2002: u'll wanna adjust those css selectors to be specific to your menu container though
[08:29:48] <aot2002> Doing that part now but it's better then where I was at
[08:33:17] <seutje> ^^
[08:33:50] <Flower21> Hi all, i need help if thats possible
[08:34:22] <Flower21> I want to know how to call a function in a jquery file, from an html file <script ... )
[08:34:38] <Flower21> on img#hover for exemple
[08:35:32] <Vaevictus> on FF it works, but on IE/Chrome it appears that .position() and .offset() return 0,0 for coords of an option tag
[08:36:06] <jmanley501> Can any one help me do a Spinner / Loading... for tabs in jQuery 1.8.14?
[08:36:32] <Vaevictus> i'm trying to scroll a multiple select box, but it doesn't seem i can determine the option's position...
[08:36:40] <jmanley501> I have the tabs setup but the spinner: option is depreciated, so trying to do it manually with beforeLoad and can't figure it out
[08:42:59] <burg> when i click an element, how can i find out how many siblings are before that element?
[08:43:45] <Whirl3d> Good morning all.
[08:43:50] <aaronfay> burg: index()?
[08:46:31] <burg> aaronfay, doesn`t work
[08:47:07] <burg> aaronfay: http://codepad.org/XLyTNcUp this code generates an error
[08:47:33] <aot2002> seutje, sadmicrowave, BillCriswell,  thanks again it's working well :)
[08:47:40] <BillCriswell> No prolemo
[08:47:48] <seutje> any time :)
[08:48:01] <Whirl3d> try $(this).index('.pagenum > div');
[08:48:10] <aaronfay> burg: try $(this).index()
[08:48:45] <Vaevictus> if anyone cares, example code illustrating the .position() bug/incompatibilty for IE/Chrome, works in FF, well documented.
[08:49:06] <Vaevictus> at http://vaevictus.net/foo.html
[08:49:10] <burg> aaronfay, thank you
[08:50:01] <Whirl3d> aaronfay, if you don't provide a selector in index, doesn't it return the index of the selected item relative to it's siblings?
[08:51:00] <aaronfay> Whirl3d: unsure
[08:52:48] <Whirl3d> I think that you have to include the selector in index (though I am not sure either) to be sure that you are getting the right collection of "siblings"...in other words, if you have three divs and four anchors under the same parent and you get the index of a div without a selector, it will be index out of 7. With a selector will be index out of say 4 (anchors)...
[08:53:25] <aaronfay> Whirl3d: so $(this).index('div')
[08:53:48] <Whirl3d> I think so, that's what it looks like from the documentation
[08:53:58] <Whirl3d> but it's a little sketchy
[08:54:04] <burg> one more question: this code: $('.pagenum > div')[index].addClass('active'); generates this error: Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'addClass' --- why?
[08:54:23] <aaronfay> Whirl3d: if there's only one type of element in the siblins list there's nothing to worry about
[08:54:35] <Whirl3d> aaronfay, true.
[08:54:51] <Whirl3d> burg, using the [] notation changes the collection to the dom literal element
[08:55:04] <nail_> burg: you want .eq(index), not [index[ which returns the raw element
[08:55:13] <Whirl3d> $("something")[3] returns a dom element, not a jquery object
[08:55:18] <aaronfay> burg: $('.pagenum >div:eq(' + index + ')').addClass
[08:55:41] <aaronfay> burg: you want the jQuery-wrapped object, not the dom element
[08:56:11] <Whirl3d> aaronfay, can you explain ('+ index +') to me? It may be the exact thing I am look for (and have been for a while)
[08:56:53] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: its basic javascript string concatenation
[08:56:54] <aaronfay> Whirl3d: http://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/ , just concatenating the index var into the selector
[08:58:28] <Whirl3d> sorry, I guess I have never seen "+ index +" before. I thought eq() took an integer argument.
[08:59:38] <janthony> Is there a way through standard html to have a form submit after selecting an option from a select dropdown in a form, or do you have to do this through javascript?
[08:59:41] <aaronfay> Whirl3d: id does, but the selector is a string literal, like ' div:eq(3)', if var bar = 3; then we need to do 'div:eq(' + bar + ')'
[09:00:18] <aaronfay> Whirl3d: Make sense?  dynamic selectors...
[09:00:19] <Whirl3d> That is cracking me up.
[09:00:20] <Whirl3d> lol
[09:00:35] <Whirl3d> I totally was thinking that + index + was some cool css selector. LOL
[09:00:54] <Whirl3d> I see now. I'm still just waking up here.
[09:01:02] <aaronfay> No worries
[09:01:18] <aaronfay> janthony: javascript, on the change event of the select
[09:01:24] <phlp> Whirl3d: there is also this $('.pagenum > div').eq(index)
[09:01:47] <janthony> aaronfay: like onchange="this.form.submit()"? or should I do it through jquery?
[09:02:09] <Vaevictus> janthony: standard html? onchange uses javascript :D
[09:02:12] <aaronfay> janthony: that should work, your preference really.  If you want to do more verbose checking/validation first, then use a function
[09:02:14] <Whirl3d> that's what I thought he was doing, so $(".pagenum > div").eq(+ index +) looked wild..but I was wrong
[09:02:25] <janthony> aaronfay: Ok, thanks!
[09:02:51] <aaronfay> Whirl3d: div:eq and ().eq() do the same thing
[09:03:26] <Vaevictus> janthony: as a rule of thumb: jquery is for making things easier to code and more compatible... hard to get easier than "this.form.submit()"
[09:03:44] <janthony> Vaevictus: Yeah, makes sense. Thanks!
[09:04:55] <Whirl3d> sure, I got that. I missed the part where you were creating a string like: var selector=".pageNum>div.eq("+index+")"...then $(selector)...I thought you were using this css notation that someone mentioned the other day...like $("div.pagenum ++") or something that I can't remember
[09:05:34] <Whirl3d> It was a css-based selector that basically said, choose the next item of the same class and it looked weird but elegant. I'll look it up in the logs
[09:05:47] <aaronfay> Whirl3d: no worries, I was being eccessively silly, .eq() would have sufficed, without the confusion :)
[09:06:33] <Whirl3d> some coke or some coffee on this end would have made it much simpler as well. LOL
[09:07:29] <blup> anyone played with the flickr api before? ive succeeded in getting the image id's, but not sure how to turn that into urls...
[09:07:33] <Whirl3d> I have a series of images in a folder and I simply want to select the next image, give one image that has the class "active". What is the best way to do that?
[09:07:57] <Whirl3d> *div not folder..
[09:10:39] <Whirl3d> $('img.eq('+$('img.active').index()+1%$(img).length+')');    ?
[09:11:52] <z0ned> i am trying to determine if a radio button on my form id "step2Form" is checked or not, how can i do this?
[09:12:35] <aaronfay> Whirl3d: wow, for sanity I would break that out into a couple lines :)
[09:12:57] <aaronfay> Whirl3d: why the modulo?
[09:13:42] <Whirl3d> It simplifies the numbering so that you don't have to check if it's greater than the total or less than zero.
[09:13:51] <z0ned> if ($('#step' + step + 'Form input[name=step' + step + ']'.is(':checked')))
[09:13:55] <z0ned> doesn't work :(
[09:14:09] <Whirl3d> But I think I got it backwards, I think its $("img").length%$("img.active").index()
[09:15:19] <aaronfay> z0ned: close your select before .is > ]').is
[09:15:38] <phishbot> jeez, the recommended hotel for jQueryBoston is expensive
[09:15:46] <eddiemonge> yup
[09:16:06] <z0ned> ahh, of course.
[09:16:08] <z0ned> aaronfay: thanks
[09:16:09] <Whirl3d> will there ever be a jqueryAtlanta?
[09:16:22] <z0ned> been staring at that for five minutes trying to figure out what was wrong lol
[09:17:25] <aaronfay> hmmm, will there every be a jQueryCalgary :);
[09:23:19] <Xeon06_> Is it normal that ui-helper-clearfix be declared twice with different "display" values? http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css
[09:25:39] <Sora_> hiya
[09:31:21] <ch3mical> Xeon06_: define "normal"
[09:31:41] <Xeon06_> ch3mical: Is it supposed to be that way?
[09:32:22] <ch3mical> Xeon06_: I'm sure there's some reason for it
[09:36:36] <eddiemonge> Xeon06_: yes. there are some browsers that you have to display it inline then switch to display block for it to work right
[09:36:55] <Xeon06_> eddiemonge: Cool, thanks
[09:37:17] <eddiemonge> its the same with floats in ie
[09:42:18] <Xeon06_> Anyone have any idea why a tab's tab containers (the ul) would have a huge height for no apparent reason?
[09:42:36] <jbrokc> how would i get all elements with class "foo" who's parents aren't "bar" ?
[09:43:03] <jbrokc> err - aren't id "bar"
[09:46:32] <sorush20> hello again, I'm tring to get this menu to .slideDown , would anyone say its more my css problem or my jquery script sorushnazari.dnydns.org
[09:46:33] <aaronfay> jbrokc: maybe $('.foo').not($('.foo').parents('#bar')); ?
[09:46:44] <aaronfay> jbrokc: just a guess, untested
[09:47:14] <aaronfay> Xeon06_: are you using a browser with a css console?
[09:47:24] <ryanprior> if I'm in a $(selector).each() loop, how can I tell whether $(this) is the last object in the set?
[09:47:28] <Xeon06_> aaronfay: Yep, Chrome
[09:47:44] <ajpiano> jbrokc: $(".bar").not(function() { return $(this).closest("#foo").length; });
[09:48:02] <aaronfay> Xeon06_: good on ya, can you inspect the elements?  in the 'Elements' view you should be able to find the one with runaway margin/padding...
[09:48:16] <ajpiano> ryanprior, var foo = $(".something");  foo.each(function(i, el) { if (foo.length == i) { // the last one  }  })
[09:48:30] <Snugug> Does anyone have any experience with Colorbox and could answer a super quick question for me?
[09:48:52] <Xeon06_> aaronfay: Sure. I can see it's computed height is set to 631px, but not where
[09:48:55] <ryanprior> thank you ajpiano
[09:49:10] <kborchers> ?demo @ Xeon06_
[09:49:11] <bot-t> Xeon06_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:49:36] <aaronfay> Xeon06_: not in the tabs constructor?  did you copy and paste the code from somewhere?
[09:49:54] <Xeon06_> kborchers: The problem is located somewhere else in the big project. I can't reproduce it on a smaller scale. I'm trying to find ways to debug that
[09:50:02] <TeddyMurray> question about jqueryui tabs -- is there a way to remove a tab without knowing its index?
[09:50:05] <Xeon06_> aaronfay: $("#tabs").tabs();
[09:50:19] <k1t> is this a legit statement: $.get("redirectSubmittedFalse.php").delay(5000); ?
[09:50:32] <TeddyMurray> $("#tabs").tabs( "remove" , index );
[09:50:35] <k1t> sorry to paste code in channel - seemed short enough.
[09:50:36] <aaronfay> Xeon06_: neat.
[09:50:44] <TeddyMurray> but i don't know the index, but i know what div its called from
[09:50:51] <TeddyMurray> is there a way to get the index?
[09:51:03] <ajpiano> k1t, no, it definitely isn't
[09:51:09] <ajpiano> (valid code)
[09:51:16] <ajpiano> the code was def short enough to paste :)
[09:51:28] <aaronfay> Xeon06_: not sure I can help more, sorry.
[09:51:30] <k1t> ajpiano: lol
[09:51:34] <ajpiano> k1t, delay is for pausing between queued things
[09:51:40] <Xeon06_> aaronfay: Thanks
[09:51:45] <k1t> ajpiano: yeah like animations
[09:51:48] <k1t> kinda figured that :(
[09:51:50] <ajpiano> if you want to do something 5 seconds after the ajax call completes, do setTimeout in the ajax callback
[09:52:07] <k1t> Ah
[09:52:36] <TeddyMurray> can someone help me with removing a tab from jqueryui tabs?
[09:52:51] <k1t> ajpiano: im looking at at docs for ajax() but I don't see any timeout stuff
[09:52:52] <TeddyMurray> i have a form within the tab, but the index isn't fixed it changes
[09:53:06] <ajpiano> k1t, it's not in the docs for ajax
[09:53:15] <k1t> Oh in the Callback
[09:53:17] <k1t> d'oh
[09:53:18] <k1t> sorry
[09:53:54] <ajpiano> TeddyMurray: you have a reference to the actual tab element or panel you want to remove though, right?
[09:54:40] <TeddyMurray> yeah, i do
[09:54:47] <ajpiano> the tab or the panel?
[09:54:54] <TeddyMurray> the div within the tab
[09:54:58] <ajpiano> ok
[09:54:58] <kborchers> TeddyMurray: are you creating them in the standard way with a tags that link to the pane div id's? if so you could do $("#tabsContainer").tabs("remove", $("#tabsContainer").find("a[href='#"+yourDivID+"']").parent().index()); untested but should be close
[09:55:11] <Briareos1> is there a way to retrieve the nesting <form> element from a selected input in jQuery?
[09:55:23] <Briareos1> i mean this.parent() is fine, but I want to support <form><div><span>jj<input ../></span></div></form> (just an example)
[09:55:24] <ajpiano> i'm doing something similar kborchers but a little less stringy
[09:55:28] <TeddyMurray> kborchers, can't do that because there are tabs being inserted and deleted all the time
[09:55:33] <erichynds> Briareos1: "this.form"
[09:55:46] <TeddyMurray> so the index will change
[09:56:17] <TeddyMurray> wait.. maybe.. let me test what you just said
[09:56:25] <bjhaid> hi, please how can i use an if statement to check for the last item in a div tag
[09:56:28] <ajpiano> TeddyMurray: wait a sec
[09:56:32] <TeddyMurray> okay ajpiano
[09:56:35] <kborchers> TeddyMurray: wait to see what ajpiano says, probably better
[09:56:49] <kborchers> that was just quick off the top of my head
[09:56:59] <TeddyMurray> thanks kborchers and ajpiano
[09:57:04] <TeddyMurray> preeeeeciaateee itttt
[09:57:06] <TeddyMurray> lol
[09:58:54] <Whirl3d> I thought you could use modulo to cycle through a series of items so that it would repeat without having to do limit checks.
[09:58:59] <ajpiano> TeddyMurray: var tabsElem = $("#yourTabsElement"), index = tabsElem.data("tabs").panels.index( $(divYouHaveAReferenceTo).closest(".ui-tabs.panel") );  tabsElem.tabs("remove", index);
[09:59:50] <TeddyMurray> O.OOOOOO
[09:59:53] <kborchers> ajpiano: so pretty :)
[09:59:57] <TeddyMurray> closest? never seen that method before
[09:59:59] <ajpiano> TeddyMurray: the important detail here being that you can get the internal jquery object of panels, and find the closest panel to the element you actually have, and then call the .index method on that cached jquery object of panels and use that
[10:00:00] <TeddyMurray> thank you, i will test it now
[10:00:21] <ajpiano> hehe kborchers :D
[10:00:22] <kborchers> always forget about data
[10:00:40] <Briareos1> erichynds: I am only getting "undefined" with that (and some variations I just tried ...)
[10:01:07] <erichynds> Briareos1: all inputs in a form should have a "form" property that references.. the form. but you can also try $(this).closest("form")
[10:01:50] <Assimilater> i'm just trying to make a plain button with an x on it and appearing to fail miserably: http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/L6hDG/4/ I'd like what displays on themeroller for the icons but i can't figure out how they made it short of adding all those classes manually
[10:02:01] <Briareos1> erichynds: apparently I was in the wrong location for this to call. thanks for the hint!
[10:03:51] <TeddyMurray> ajpiano, using tabs remove will also delete it from the DOM rightg?
[10:03:58] <TeddyMurray> not just.. hide it or something
[10:04:01] <ajpiano> YUP
[10:04:03] <TeddyMurray> kk
[10:04:17] <TeddyMurray> almost done adapting to my envrionment
[10:04:21] <TeddyMurray> hey that's like evolution
[10:04:28] <ajpiano> LOL i was about to say
[10:04:31] <ajpiano> i'll let darwin know
[10:04:33] <TeddyMurray> lolol
[10:04:41] <pYr0x> hi... is it possible to center the jquery UI dialogbox in a div container?
[10:05:27] <Ezequiel_> so i'm using this little script to get resolution-specific stylesheets in IE http://css-tricks.com/6206-resolution-specific-stylesheets/
[10:06:17] <Ezequiel_> i have tried to adapt that code to get resolution specific JS, but changing the attr to src
[10:06:25] <Ezequiel_> it's not working
[10:06:29] <Ezequiel_> can anyone tell me why?
[10:07:01] <Assimilater> anyone know how to make a button that looks like the li's on the framework icon ul on themeroller with something like .button()? or was it just hard coded css?
[10:08:36] <Cork[home]> Ezequiel_: you mean loading a js through link?
[10:08:47] <Ezequiel_> no
[10:08:50] <Ezequiel_> script tag
[10:09:03] <Ezequiel_> you select it via id
[10:09:13] <Ezequiel_> or can script tags have ids?
[10:09:17] <Whirl3d> could someone help me with this simple task: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/9GpZa/30/
[10:09:33] <Cork[home]> Ezequiel_: they can but you can't change a src thats already in the head
[10:09:45] <Ezequiel_> damn
[10:09:48] <Cork[home]> Ezequiel_: thats pointless as the code will already be loaded
[10:09:55] <Cork[home]> use the script loader
[10:09:57] <Ezequiel_> i trid using head.append
[10:10:00] <Cork[home]> ?.loadscript
[10:10:00] <bot-t> Cork[home], jQuery.getScript() - Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[10:10:04] <TeddyMurray> ajpiano, weird
[10:10:06] <Ezequiel_> oooohhhh
[10:10:08] <TeddyMurray> its saying -1 is my index
[10:10:09] <Ezequiel_> loadscript?
[10:10:09] <TeddyMurray> when im at 0
[10:10:12] <Ezequiel_> didnt know that one

[10:10:20] <freeed> Whirl3d: $('.active').removeClass(next().fadeIn
[10:10:23] <Cork[home]> what ever :=)
[10:10:39] <TeddyMurray> actually, it says -1 wherever i am
[10:10:53] <freeed> Whirl3d, oops, $('.active').removeClass('active').next().fadeIn(500).addClass('active')
[10:11:12] <TeddyMurray> i will pastebin, ajpiano
[10:11:35] <TeddyMurray> http://pastebin.com/HXmKcCfV
[10:11:52] <Ezequiel_> thanks
[10:12:18] <Whirl3d> freeed, thanks. But what about when you get to the end and you want to start over?
[10:12:41] <Cork[home]> Ezequiel_: np
[10:13:02] <Ezequiel_> do i have to use a full url?
[10:13:11] <Ezequiel_> or can i just do js/custom.js
[10:13:14] <Ezequiel_> ?
[10:13:25] <Cork[home]> Ezequiel_: its relative to the document, same as all urls
[10:13:32] <Cork[home]> so / http or local
[10:13:34] <Cork[home]> all works
[10:15:27] <pYr0x> hi... is it possible to center the jquery UI dialogbox in a div container?
[10:15:53] <Ezequiel_> it's not loading, darnit
[10:16:25] <tomasm-> anyone familiar with jeditable, or know how I can get it to recognize newlines as html breaks (<br>)? I want to have something with multiple paragraphs
[10:16:31] <ajpiano> TeddyMurray: uh, where is "deleteDiv" coming from
[10:16:31] <kborchers> pYr0x: why would you want to do that. dialogs are meant to be displayed above all other content without being affected by that content
[10:16:39] <TeddyMurray> var deleteForm = $(this).parents("form:first");
[10:16:47] <TeddyMurray> oh.
[10:16:48] <TeddyMurray> duh.
[10:16:58] <rson_> is there a pre-baked iframe shimming things over browser plugins for IE?  i've seen bgiframe but it only tests for ie6 and I can't verify if it works or not.
[10:17:04] <Cork[home]> Ezequiel_: hmm do you get a get call to the server at all?
[10:17:11] <pYr0x> kborchers: i have a div container on the left side.. and the dialog box should be into them
[10:17:14] <pYr0x> centered
[10:17:17] <rson_> er, a pre-baked solution for shimming*
[10:17:17] <Ezequiel_> im not sure
[10:17:22] <Ezequiel_> gimme a sec
[10:17:38] <Assimilater> anyone know how to make a button that looks like the li's on the framework icon ul on themeroller with something like .button()? or was it just hard coded css?
[10:18:10] <Ezequiel_> http://pastebin.com/Sztttf6i
[10:18:20] <Whirl3d> freeed, you tease! I'm trying to get .next() to cycle to the first element when it reaches the last....any suggestions?
[10:18:20] <Ezequiel_> is there anything wrong with this code?
[10:18:32] <Cork[home]> pYr0x: dialogs don't have that functionality revield by default
[10:18:44] <kborchers> pYr0x: well, if you calculate the absolute center of the div, you could use that combined with the width of the dialog to position using the position option
[10:18:56] <Cork[home]> pYr0x: but the underlying dragable has an option container that you can set
[10:19:32] <pYr0x> ok
[10:19:33] <TeddyMurray> okay, ajpiano, should i change it from the form to the parent div?
[10:19:34] <pYr0x> thx
[10:19:42] <TeddyMurray> let me paste what i ahve now, its still saying -1
[10:19:56] <djQuery> getting a weird error with .tmpl when trying to add a new record. http://jsbin.com/apesih/15/edit
[10:19:59] <TeddyMurray> all i did was change that variable name
[10:20:03] <ajpiano> TeddyMurray: you have to *Get* the index of the element in the dom
[10:20:05] <djQuery> click on the Add Table button
[10:20:24] <freeed> Whirl3d: if ($('.bgPanel img.active').length() > 0) { var obj = $('.bgPanel img.active') } else { var obj = $('.bgPanel img:nth-child(0)') } $(obj).removeClass('active').next().addClass('active').fadeIn(500)     probably a cleaner way, but tis what came to mind.. to check for active, if not (end of the loop) it should grab the first child.
[10:20:41] <ajpiano> TeddyMurray: you need to debug
[10:20:57] <ajpiano> TeddyMurray: console.log( tabsElem.data("tabs").panels )
[10:21:01] <ajpiano> see if it's finding the panels properly
[10:21:02] <ajpiano> etc.
[10:21:04] <TeddyMurray> kk
[10:21:06] <ajpiano> oh dude
[10:21:06] <TeddyMurray> ty
[10:21:08] <ajpiano> TeddyMurray
[10:21:10] <TeddyMurray> yes?
[10:21:17] <ajpiano> .closest(".ui-tabs-pane")
[10:21:20] <ajpiano> .closest(".ui-tabs-panel")
[10:21:26] <TeddyMurray> ah ha
[10:21:44] <ajpiano> yeah my bad, typo
[10:21:51] <ajpiano> well
[10:22:08] <ajpiano> sorta ;)
[10:22:24] <TeddyMurray> still says negative 1, let me debug
[10:22:39] <roger_padactor> im having trouble getting this working.  $('#container').append($('<div id="bla">....</div>'));  console.log($('bla'));  i get nothing as if it wasn't added
[10:22:54] <freeed> Whirl3d, might be worth it to look for something similar to find() that will loop back to element 1 if there is no next sibling.
[10:22:58] <ajpiano> roger_padactor cause $("bla") doesn't do anything
[10:23:01] <ajpiano> $("#bla")
[10:23:09] <ajpiano> roger_padactor, furthermore, it's better to just do
[10:23:19] <TeddyMurray> ajpiano, it shows the 5 div's, edit-item-1,edit-item-2,edit-item-3,etc
[10:23:23] <ajpiano> var div = $("<div id='bla'>").appendTo("#container")
[10:23:31] <ajpiano> TeddyMurray: you don't have to console log that
[10:23:31] <Whirl3d> freeed, thanks for your help. this should work great: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/9GpZa/36/
[10:23:34] <TeddyMurray> does not include the menu headers
[10:23:36] <ajpiano> the problem was the selector in closest
[10:23:54] <TeddyMurray> i changed the selector, its still saying -1
[10:24:02] <TeddyMurray> posting updated code
[10:24:14] <freeed> roger_padactor, dont forget the pound sign; console.log($('#bla'))
[10:24:39] <roger_padactor> yeah. i tried both ways still nothing.. must be something that is messing it up
[10:24:41] <Cork[home]> Ezequiel_: its getScript
[10:24:45] <Cork[home]> not getscript
[10:24:50] <TeddyMurray> http://pastebin.com/CrhsbfUv
[10:24:53] <Ezequiel_> ......
[10:24:54] <Ezequiel_> ah
[10:25:06] <wathek> Hi all
[10:25:07] <Cork[home]> Ezequiel_: and you don't need to do parseInt
[10:25:13] <Cork[home]> width() is always a number
[10:25:43] <Ezequiel_> okay
[10:25:45] <TeddyMurray> just debugged $(deleteForm).closest(".ui-tabs.pane") ajpiano
[10:25:49] <TeddyMurray> its returning null
[10:25:50] <Ezequiel_> the parsint wasnt my idea
[10:25:50] <TeddyMurray> hmm
[10:25:52] <ajpiano> dude
[10:25:54] <ajpiano> TeddyMurray
[10:26:04] <Ezequiel_> is that why the script prepends my div a million times?
[10:26:12] <ajpiano> .ui-tabs-panel
[10:26:13] <wathek> I got a problem with the selector I'm using $('.myclass[data-prod=' + $(this).attr('data-prod') + ']')
[10:26:14] <ajpiano> is the class
[10:26:20] <ajpiano> you need to find the closest one of
[10:26:25] <ajpiano> ?closest @ TeddyMurray
[10:26:25] <bot-t> TeddyMurray, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[10:26:25] <wathek> but the problem is when the value of my selector contains spaces
[10:26:33] <TeddyMurray> lol oops, i didn't see the period
[10:26:47] <TeddyMurray> thought you were changing panel to pane
[10:26:48] <freeed> roger_padactor, oh, derp :) $('#container').append('<div id="blah"></div>')   console.log($('blah'))
[10:26:48] <TeddyMurray> XD
[10:26:55] <ajpiano> no, i pressed enter one strike early
[10:27:09] <TeddyMurray> lol
[10:27:09] <ajpiano> freeed, roger_padactor that won't work
[10:27:29] <freeed> aj, no?
[10:27:40] <Cork[home]> Ezequiel_: well you shouldn't really load a script file depending on the screen sice
[10:27:50] <TeddyMurray> works like a charm ajpiano
[10:27:54] <TeddyMurray> thanks a lot :D
[10:28:00] <Ezequiel_> darn
[10:28:02] <TeddyMurray> and i learned a new method
[10:28:03] <TeddyMurray> woot
[10:28:05] <Fernandos> has anyone experience with jquery in coffescript?
[10:28:06] <Cork[home]> Ezequiel_: as each time the resize event triggers you will load a new file
[10:28:07] <TeddyMurray> 100exp
[10:28:17] <Ezequiel_> thing is, i want to leave a specific JS file out of the mobile version of my site
[10:29:09] <tra> what is the best way to shuffle an array or shuffle an ul's li elements orders?
[10:29:12] <roger_padactor> ajpiano: yeah doesn't want to work. div is returning as  []
[10:29:29] <jbrokc> ajpiano: your method for filtering out parents works great. thanks! i don't understand the .length return though
[10:30:00] <Ezequiel_> alright, how can I remove a JS file depending on screen size?
[10:30:14] <Ezequiel_> then it doesn't matter how many times it executes
[10:30:14] <Cork[home]> Ezequiel_: you can't really
[10:30:17] <kborchers> Ezequiel_: check out http://yepnopejs.com/
[10:30:17] <howdoilol> How can I make cross domain GET request (I want to check if my server is up and alive)
[10:30:33] <tra> howdoilol: jsonp could do the trick
[10:30:35] <Ezequiel_> .....
[10:30:47] <freeed> ajpiano, roger_padactor: http://jsfiddle.net/e4kTS/1/
[10:30:48] <wathek> how can I do when I'd like to select tag using the value of one attribute and that that attribute contains space ? .class[attribute=value]
[10:30:52] <Ezequiel_> again, Responsive design insists on making my life harder
[10:31:04] <Cork[home]> Ezequiel_: i think this might actually be the time to do browser sniffing
[10:31:14] <Cork[home]> Ezequiel_: detecting the os type
[10:31:18] <Ezequiel_> yeah
[10:31:25] <Ezequiel_> ive been thinking on that
[10:31:25] <Cork[home]> not sure theres another way to do this right
[10:31:34] <Ezequiel_> alright
[10:31:37] <ajpiano> freeed: yeah, it works if you include the # :)
[10:31:38] <Ezequiel_> well, thanks for all your help
[10:31:39] <howdoilol> tra: I'm getting 403 with jsonp. I need a plain GET request to just get the response code
[10:31:53] <Cork[home]> Ezequiel_: but i mean checking in js, not from the server
[10:31:59] <Ezequiel_> i know
[10:32:03] <Ezequiel_> UA sniffing
[10:32:04] * Cork[home] nods
[10:32:07] <Ezequiel_> argh
[10:32:07] <ajpiano> freeed, roger_padactor this is preferable, imo http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/e4kTS/2/
[10:32:12] <tra> howdoilol: using a proxy then?
[10:32:54] <howdoilol> tra: can it be done in plain javascript if it's not possible with jQuery?
[10:32:55] <Ezequiel_> that'll make testing a bit harder
[10:32:59] <Ezequiel_> but i know it'll work
[10:33:01] <freeed> aj, nice.. didn't know appendTo returns the new object like that. thanks for the tip.
[10:33:06] <howdoilol> tra: or is just impossible by nature
[10:33:31] <ajpiano> freeed, yeah it's way preferable to creating an object and then requerying the dom to get it
[10:33:57] <tra> howdoilol: well some servers don't support jsonp. make a simple php-script that will make the request for you and call it with $.ajax
[10:33:59] <freeed> dood you still rockin that giant fro? :p
[10:34:21] <Cork[home]> Ezequiel_: there is actually another option
[10:34:32] <Cork[home]> Ezequiel_: screen.width
[10:34:41] <Ezequiel_> .......
[10:34:45] <Ezequiel_> alright?
[10:34:55] <Ezequiel_> got a link to a tutorial or something?
[10:35:08] <Ezequiel_> oh wiat
[10:35:11] <howdoilol> tra: this is not possible for me (system requirement), I have an offline html file and I want to check if user can reach the host from his machine by "ping-ing" the server. Can it be done somehow with jQuery?
[10:35:11] <Cork[home]> Ezequiel_: its just the screen size of the device
[10:35:13] <Ezequiel_> screen.width
[10:35:26] <Ezequiel_> depends on monitor size doesn't it?
[10:35:29] <Cork[home]> yes
[10:35:33] <Ezequiel_> again, difficult to test for
[10:35:38] <Ezequiel_> but probably very effective
[10:35:45] <Cork[home]> well its basically what you do in your css
[10:36:17] <tra> howdoilol: might get tricky. i usually have gone around the crossdomain restrictions by using a php proxy.
[10:36:19] <Ezequiel_> will resizing my browser show me the changes?
[10:36:25] <Cork[home]> no
[10:36:31] <simple__> I need help understanding what this means....  I'm getting a 304 Not modified response when i run a "GET" request, and the data is not being processed by my script,  Is there a way to modify the headers that are sent so i stop getting 304?
[10:36:50] <howdoilol> tra: this restriction is created by jQuery or by the browser itself?
[10:37:16] <Ezequiel_> meh
[10:37:25] <Ezequiel_> i'll probably go with UA sniffing
[10:37:31] <Ezequiel_> that at least i can test with
[10:37:35] <Cork[home]> heh
[10:38:11] <tra> howdoilol: implemented in all browsers -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[10:38:46] <howdoilol> tra: what a joke... whatever, thanks for your help, good bye
[10:38:58] <tra> what a joke :D
[10:39:14] <tra> problem solved
[10:39:26] <Snugug> How can I remove easing from an animate function?
[10:39:39] <TeddyMurray> hey ajpiano
[10:39:44] <TeddyMurray> i think its actually $( ".edit-scroll-content" ).tabs( "option", "length" )
[10:39:47] <TeddyMurray> im gunna try that now
[10:40:12] <TeddyMurray> oh, that isn't in the code you gave me
[10:40:15] <TeddyMurray> i move things around too much..
[10:40:16] <TeddyMurray> :P
[10:40:41] <ajpiano> i have no idea what you're on about
[10:40:52] <ajpiano> jbrokc: .length returns 0 or a number
[10:41:13] <ajpiano> jbrokc, .not(fn) removes from the set anything that returns a truthy value from the iterator
[10:41:17] <jbrokc> ajpiano: right, but how does that evaluate to .not ?
[10:41:19] <ajpiano> like, length being
[10:41:22] <ajpiano> 1
[10:42:45] <Whirl3d> snugug, what kind of animation function?
[10:42:56] <robertoss> hey im looking for something that will tell me which element is closest to the top of a scrolling div, the idea is to update a 'page number' onscreen as i scroll, like having 'currently viewing'. Like in MS word as you scroll through pages and it says what page youre, possible?
[10:43:10] <Snugug> Whirl3d: plain animate. I'm trying to add a terminal-esque cursor to the end of one of my divs
[10:43:27] <Snugug> using .animate and opacity with a duration, but it fades in and out instead of blinks like a terminal cursor does
[10:43:37] <Nicolas_Leonidas> does anyone know a decent Jquery Tree?
[10:43:42] <Whirl3d> it shouldn't have easing unless you specify it, I believe
[10:44:12] <Whirl3d> $("something").animate({left:"-30px"},3000) should move to the left 30 px without easing
[10:44:33] <Snugug> Whirl3d: And yet it fades between opacity 1 and opacity 0
[10:45:05] <Whirl3d> $("something").animate({opacity:0},3000) should do the same = no easing
[10:45:16] <grkblood13> I'm having an issue in an older version of fixefox where the toggle function isnt working expecting, Ive put together a test file here: http://pastebin.com/x10YwBnL
[10:45:20] <Snugug> Hmm, I'm going to try using hide instead
[10:46:08] <Whirl3d> I know there was a bug in either hide or fadein/out in 1.6...you might want to check to see if that bug is resolved. I am sure it is, I just haven't checked.
[10:46:41] <freeed> Snugug, linear is the default easing method of .animate()
[10:46:51] <Whirl3d> $("something").hide(3000, "easeLinear") might work. It might not be "easeLinear"
[10:47:03] <Snugug> freeed: Hmm...
[10:47:21] <freeed> to animate anything there must be a speed / time.
[10:47:45] <Snugug> freeed: I don't want to animate, I really just want to toggle between hidden/shown at a set interval
[10:47:55] <freeed> errrr distance / duration would be more accurate
[10:48:07] <freeed> then use .hide() and .show()
[10:48:16] <Whirl3d> ^^
[10:48:19] <Snugug> That's what I'm doing now
[10:48:59] <Whirl3d> using .animate and opacity with a duration, but it fades in and out instead of blinks like a terminal cursor does
[10:49:05] <Whirl3d> direct quote
[10:50:09] <orolo> im stuck on an issue. i'm testing to see if a key exists in an object: if ( myObject[0][foo]) . if foo doesn't exist, the script should just continue w/out throwing an error, right?
[10:50:31] <roger_padactor> how would you detect if text inside of a div has gone over the overflow point when its hidden?
[10:51:45] <freeed> orolo, yep. it simply would return false and the logic would continue beyond that condition.
[10:52:25] <orolo> freeed: thx.
[10:52:32] <freeed> roger_padactor.. special :p you'd have to grab the .height() of the parent container, then check if the .top() of a child element is larger than that pervious height. .. i think :\
[10:53:21] <ringotwo> roger padactor is a bad man
[10:54:30] <Snugug> This is what I'm doing and it's not working, thoughts?

[11:08:03] <djQuery> so no-one knows templates enough to give me a hand?

[11:14:01] <tomasm-> can anyone recommend an inline resizer tool for images on a webpage? I upload an image and have a default width/height to fit on the page but want to be able to adjust it sometimes, ie smaller or bigger...
[11:14:03] <aot2002_> any idea's for something like jquery-imagefit-plugin that works in IE or all browsers?
[11:15:50] <aot2002_> tomasm-, something like this http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/image-scale
[11:16:31] <tomasm-> aot2002_, does that just fit the available container, or can the user resize it arbitrarily using handles?
[11:16:58] <djQuery> tomasm-: see ?ui.resizeable
[11:16:59] <bot-t> tomasm-, The jQuery UI Resizable plugin makes selected elements resizable (meaning they have draggable resize handles). http://jqueryui.com/demos/resizable/
[11:19:10] <tomasm-> djQuery, yes, but i wonder if the handles can be made to look like whats used traditionally for images (ie the little white boxes with a dashed-border in between)
[11:20:30] <djQuery> tomasm-: believe it has options to change what the handles are
[11:21:22] <djQuery> ?lmgtfy jquery image resize plugin@tomasm

[11:25:24] <ch3mical> Ok, who wants to help me figure out this autocomplete issue? http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/Nj2Ur/
[11:26:02] <ch3mical> I'm doing the exact thing I see on the demos page, but it isn't working for me
[11:26:26] <djQuery> ch3mical: catalogs needs to return a label and id prop not a value and guid
[11:26:50] <ch3mical> The demo uses "value" and the other properties shouldn't matter
[11:26:50] <skiz> ch3mical: surely you have looked at the js console? there is a typeerror
[11:27:02] <ch3mical> Yeah, exactly
[11:27:11] <ch3mical> But the demo does the same thing and it works
[11:27:30] <ch3mical> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#xml
[11:27:42] <roger_padactor> i have a button on click it adds a dive to another area, then when im done i remove it by clicking on it. if i clikc on the same button to add it back it wont add it back in. seems to only run once. although it seems like its there when i do a console.log
[11:28:02] <ch3mical> Also look at http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data for another example of the object literal array
[11:28:31] <TrIpNI> :--o
[11:28:43] <ch3mical> As you can see in both cases "value" is a property, but the other properties are not looked at by the autocomplete widget itself
[11:29:06] <ch3mical> And in all cases (including mine) the "source" is an array of object literals
[11:29:09] <kborchers> ch3mical: when you do stuff like that though, you have to write your own _renderItem
[11:29:36] <ch3mical> Oh, is that what I missed?
[11:29:41] <ch3mical> I hadn't noticed that
[11:29:52] <kborchers> believe so
[11:29:57] <ch3mical> Thanks kborchers, I'll try that
[11:33:21] <crab> if i do $('foo').click(function () { ... }), can i later fetch the function i bound to click on foo?
[11:34:03] <djQuery> crab: if you give the funciton a name
[11:34:28] <pl0sh> crab you should do something like this: $('foo').click(function () { aFunction() });
[11:34:34] <djQuery> function myclick(e){}    $('foo').click(myclick);
[11:34:40] <pl0sh> then you could call the aFunction( ) later..
[11:35:24] <kborchers> pl0sh: why create an anonymous function then call your other function when you can just pass the function like djQuery did ^^
[11:36:37] <pl0sh> kborchers yes, I actually do it as djQuery did, I just wanted to show that this way is possible too..

[11:37:29] <crab> the point is of course that i don't know at that point what function is handling the click

[11:38:48] <djQuery> crab: ajpiano has some excelent tips in there
[11:39:18] <stefancrs> hi, I'm using the scrollable plugin in jquery tools, displaying three divs at a time, for some reason, it wants to scroll TWO items on the first scroll (but keeps to one item at a time afterwards). this is the html used: http://pastie.org/2249825, and I initiate the scrollable with 	$(".toutable").scrollable({ circular: true,  easing: "swing", speed: 700 });
[11:39:20] <djQuery> jaequery: you corgot the closing }
[11:39:24] <stefancrs> any ideas?
[11:39:41] <jaequery> basically im trying to just regex match a word if it contains "{blabla}" , where word = "Hi my name is {blablabla}";
[11:39:49] <crab> uhm, ok. thanks anyway.
[11:40:06] <ajpiano> djQuery you're passing an undefined object to tmpl on line 110 of your script i believe
[11:40:24] <jaequery> im asking just on the regex part
[11:40:25] <AfroTurf> does .find("selector",true) return boolean?
[11:40:37] <ajpiano> djQuery, if i were you, i would just do scheme.Tables.push(table); and then $("#tbltmpl1").tmpl(table);
[11:40:44] <mipo> hi
[11:40:50] <ajpiano> instead of trying to read it back off the array, you have a local ref already
[11:40:50] <mipo> how's everything?
[11:41:54] <djQuery> ajpiano: doing $('#tbltmpl').tmpl( table).appendTo($tablearea) generates the same error
[11:42:13] <ajpiano> odd
[11:42:21] <djQuery> and I thought doing scheme.Tables[scheme.Tables.length] = table was actualy faster than .push
[11:42:22] <djQuery> ?
[11:42:39] <ajpiano> i don't know about faster there, but clearly push is PLENTY fast
[11:42:49] <ajpiano> and way less ugly imo
[11:42:58] <systemfault> Right.
[11:43:13] <djQuery> ajpiano: actualy giving it the local object causes it throw an error that Indexes is not defined
[11:43:24] <systemfault> And you can do sexy things with .push, like a in-place .concat :P
[11:43:42] <ajpiano> djQuery: wait, why are you creating table as a global
[11:43:43] <ajpiano> :/
[11:45:24] <djQuery> ajpiano: because I forgot to put var there. thats fixed now
[11:45:29] <ajpiano> ah
[11:46:22] * djQuery need to write up the bug with menubar
[11:46:24] <ajpiano> man i really do not like the jquery tmpl api
[11:46:24] <ajpiano> :/
[11:46:39] <djQuery> ajpiano: reading up on knockout.js right now
[11:46:52] <ajpiano> djQuery: i've been using handlebars for templating on my last few projects
[11:46:59] <hazamonzo__> hey folks. How might i attach a new table row <tr><td>hello</td></tr> to the end of my existing table? Im trying tr:last but that seems to add the row after the last td in the last row...
[11:47:32] <djQuery> ajpiano: does it have databinding built into it as well or is it just a view like tmpl?
[11:47:39] <ajpiano> hazamonzo__: $("#yourTable tbody").append("<tr><td/></tr>")
[11:47:53] <ajpiano> just a view
[11:47:54] <AfroTurf> $("div").has("span") how do i get this to return a boolean?
[11:48:01] <AfroTurf> or something similiar
[11:48:18] <hazamonzo__> ajpiano: Genius. Thank you :)
[11:48:21] <stefancrs> there are also some weird issues with the circular behaviour, it's almost as if the scrollable plugin isn't really properly picking up my items, but I don't see why it shouldn't
[11:48:38] <jaequery> ajpiano: im also working on templatingright now, coincidentally, what exactly is handlebars?
[11:48:41] <ajpiano> AfroTurf: check it's length
[11:48:44] <jaequery> and how is it so far for you?
[11:48:54] <ajpiano> http://www.handlebarsjs.com/
[11:49:03] <ajpiano> it's nice, i've liked it
[11:49:03] <AfroTurf> ajpiano: aah thats right thanks
[11:49:06] <roger_padactor> problem add div to a container. once added I add a click for the container to remove the div. if I click on the container, the div gets removed. i click to add the div back in, it doesn't get added to the dom. even though in the console if I log the variable it says its the div.  if i inspect the container element it is not there.  however, the first time I click to add the div it is in the html inspection.
[11:49:27] <jaequery> oh wow, thats exactly what i been looking for
[11:49:40] <jaequery> except, i wanted my template placeholders to be just,  {bla}, and not {{bla}}
[11:49:41] <ajpiano> it's like mustache just the api is considerably better
[11:49:51] <ajpiano> you can customise the delimiter
[11:50:20] <ajpiano> i think
[11:51:06] <jaequery> argh and one thing i hate about all these template engines is their way of looping/if/etc
[11:51:12] <jaequery> why cant they just let you do that in javascript?
[11:51:33] <ajpiano> jaequery: underscore's templates let you just write js in the templates
[11:51:40] <erichynds> ejs lets you do that as well
[11:51:52] <ajpiano> but i'm pretty sure that executing arbitrary JS inside of a template is considered a security risk
[11:52:02] <ajpiano> and tbh, it comes out pretty ugly
[11:52:18] <ajpiano> having to use handlebars helpers kinda enforces some discipline on your
[11:52:22] <jaequery> does handlebar let you have your own javascript code?
[11:52:41] <jaequery> i tried jade, and it was, nightmarish
[11:52:57] <ajpiano> jaequery: it lets you write helpers
[11:53:08] <ajpiano> thinkvitamin.com/code/handlebars-js-part-2-partials-and-helpers/
[11:53:32] <jaequery> and yeah, underscore is ugly
[11:55:29] <jaequery> i am creating views more and more with javascript lately, i just need a real javascript-driven template engine
[11:55:42] <jaequery> is there none like it?
[11:55:50] <ajpiano> jaequery: have you seen weld?
[11:55:59] <ajpiano> it's a very different approach
[11:56:30] <ajpiano> https://github.com/hij1nx/Weld
[11:56:37] <stefancrs> wtf, it's only when I set the scrollable to be circular that it's buggy
[11:56:58] <stefancrs> jaequery: check out mustache as well
[11:57:00] <ajpiano> jaequery: it doesn't do the whole declarative blocks of "html" with delimiting
[11:57:12] <ajpiano> mustache is painful
[11:57:47] <stefancrs> I haven't used it but it seems awesome for php/.net, might be different in js though
[11:58:00] <stefancrs> but it's a good thing it's so cross platfor
[11:58:00] <stefancrs> m
[11:58:34] <ajpiano> it's really verbose compared to handlebars and makes certain basic tasks really kludgy
[11:58:56] <stefancrs> no-one has any idea why scrollable (jQuery tools) would have problems with scrolling this while being circular? http://pastie.org/2249825
[11:59:02] <ajpiano> like if you want to print out the key name of something in an object.... you have to convert it to an array of {name: "keyname", value: "value"}
[11:59:22] <ajpiano> vom
[11:59:44] <LakWork> ajpiano are there any drawbacks to 'littering' a page with CSS class definitions? Does it have a noticeable affect on lookups?
[11:59:50] <ajpiano> huh
[11:59:56] <LakWork> err not definitions, rather uses
[12:00:16] <ajpiano> are you asking if using css is a performance hit
[12:00:17] <ajpiano> :p
[12:00:18] <LakWork> i.e. if i have a bunch of elements with 3 or 4 classes on that is that going to affect how fast the sizzler engine works?
[12:00:24] <ajpiano> no
[12:00:29] <LakWork> someone over on efnet claims it can be
[12:00:32] <LakWork> i doubted it
[12:00:59] <ajpiano> sounds like nonsense hearsay FUD to me
[12:01:01] <tsmart> I have a jquery selectors question: how come I get a different result if I do jQuery('form#all') and jQuery('form')[1]
[12:01:07] <tsmart> they both look thike the form I want
[12:01:09] <LakWork> good to know
[12:01:12] <tsmart> but one is a jQuery object
[12:01:23] <tsmart> the first one nad hte second is not
[12:01:36] <tsmart> how do I get the form in the first way without the jQuery object stuff?
[12:01:43] <ajpiano> tsmart: because doing array style dereferncing on a jquery object gets you a dom element
[12:01:49] <ajpiano> use .eq(0)
[12:01:51] <ajpiano> or .first()
[12:02:23] <tsmart> mainly ajpiano I don't want a jQuery object
[12:02:33] <ajpiano> oh whoops misread
[12:02:36] <tsmart> you see in a plugin I grab the form and set a variable on it
[12:02:41] <tsmart> on the DOM object called temp
[12:02:49] <tsmart> if I grab te jQuery object
[12:02:52] <tsmart> I can't acccess the variable
[12:02:59] <tsmart> but if I do it the index way I can
[12:02:59] <ajpiano> $("#all")[0] or... document.getElementById("all")
[12:03:10] <ajpiano> also... it's not good to set arbitrary properties on dom elements
[12:03:14] <ajpiano> that's what jQuery.data is for
[12:03:28] <tsmart> ajpiano, YES!
[12:03:30] <tsmart> that was it
[12:03:38] <tsmart> jQuery.data?
[12:04:37] <ajpiano> http://api.jquery.com/data/ http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/ http://jqfundamentals.com/book/index.html#example-4.2
[12:05:12] <tsmart> thank you ajpiano

[12:06:28] <ddsdns> Can you use jQuery to handle text dropped onto an element?

[12:07:00] <freeed> ddsdns, sure.
[12:07:28] <PhanLord> does anyone know a way of decoding a 16bit grayscale PNG image in javascript (i want to do my own conversion from 16bit gray top RGB)
[12:07:55] <PhanLord> right now browser loads tha timage fine but it presents me onyl with RGB pixels :(
[12:08:07] <PhanLord> i know its not jquery question :)

[12:08:36] <GeO`> hi
[12:08:56] <GeO`> I have bound a function to an element on click()
[12:08:57] <ddsdns> freeed: How?
[12:09:09] <GeO`> can I somehow make as if this element was clicked ?
[12:09:26] <GeO`> like simulate the element has been clicked, so my function is fired
[12:09:59] <freeed> ddsdns, would need more info about what you're doing.. but quickly .text() or .html() might be what you're looking for.
[12:10:14] <voogzy> GeO` .trigger('click')
[12:10:17] <voogzy> or something like that :)
[12:10:33] <GeO`> I love jquery
[12:11:00] <voogzy> GeO` http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[12:12:25] <n20> GeO`: .trigger(): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type.
[12:12:33] * n20 tries the life as a bot.
[12:13:19] <GeO`> perfect
[12:13:22] <GeO`> thx
[12:14:38] <kborchers> GeO`: fyi, .click() is a shortcut for trigger("click"); see ?click
[12:14:38] <bot-t> GeO`, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[12:14:50] <ddsdns> freeed: If you highlight some text, you can drag'n'drop the text into a text input. If I drag'n'drop the text onto say, a div or an a, can I get the text that was dropped onto the element?
[12:15:12] <ch3mical> So, specifying a custom _renderItem didn't make it work... kborchers
[12:15:30] <kborchers> ch3mical: link?
[12:16:07] <ch3mical> http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/Nj2Ur/1/
[12:16:11] <freeed> ddsdns, oh.. well you'd probably need to use the jquery ui drag and drop to actually add that text to the element in question, then .text() would be able to output said text.
[12:17:12] <kborchers> ch3mical: just fyi, this doesn't fix your issue but ui does not support 1.6.x yet. still looking though
[12:17:53] <ch3mical> Did not know. I've actually been using it with 1.6.1 for a while now
[12:17:59] <ch3mical> Since it was released, actually
[12:18:21] <kborchers> ch3mical: i think most stuff works ok but you will run into some things here and there
[12:18:34] <ch3mical> I'll keep that in mind
[12:19:14] <shiftins> is there a way to tell if $(document).ready() was fired as result of backbutton vs. page load?
[12:19:55] <shiftins> or, any other reliable way to tell if the page is rendered as result of back button instead of page load?
[12:20:05] <GeO`> how did I do without jquery...
[12:20:10] <ch3mical> shiftins: I don't know, but I'm guessing if there was a way you would find it on the event object
[12:20:15] <ddsdns> freeed: I have a search box that is displayed only after you click a "show" link. Could people drop text onto the "show" link and it'd go into the search box?
[12:20:40] <tomasm-> shiftins - not sure, but maybe you can set a variable onLoad and then when you go back, it might be set already? i could be wrong
[12:21:08] <freeed> ddsdns, probably with jquery ui like I mentioned. Don't see why not :p
[12:21:13] <tomasm-> shiftins, i know form fields stick when you go back, so maybe a hidden form field?
[12:22:44] <shiftins> i have been playing with the form fields to handle this..
[12:23:06] <shiftins> i saw an unexpected behavior.. set to blank, onReady give it a value..
[12:23:14] <shiftins> user clicks away, and then back.. it has the value still
[12:23:28] <ries> Gents, if I have this <a class="myHover">my target</a><div>my div to show</div>  And I out a mouseover event on all tags with the class myHover. What is the best way to find the first div after the a tag?
[12:24:05] <shiftins> but then, using the javascript console to location.replace(location.href) didn't reset the value, however using the console to document.location.href=document.location.href did reset to the original blank state..
[12:24:16] <shiftins> so logically the flow was working correctly..
[12:25:00] <shiftins> but when using inline script to document.location.href=document.location.href the form field wasn't getting reset..
[12:25:35] <lotjuh> sometimes your browser fills out your old values
[12:25:47] <freeed> ries $('a.myHover div')   or in your over function $(this).find('div')
[12:25:59] <shiftins> yea, I know.. that's why using form fields for this sucks ;)
[12:26:06] <lotjuh> idd (-=
[12:26:32] <lotjuh> I believe you can tell your browser not to cache them though, with an attribute to the form fields
[12:26:52] <ries> freeed: I was fooling around with : eventObject.currentTarget.parent().next();
[12:27:30] <systemfault> ries: Why .parent()?
[12:27:41] <ch3mical> kborchers: no luck?
[12:27:42] <systemfault> ries: The div is not just after it?
[12:28:03] <kborchers> ch3mical: almost there. may not be exactly what you want but should get you on the right track. just a sec
[12:28:05] <shiftins> ch3mical: ready() doesn't return an event object
[12:28:19] <ries> systemfault: I thought it would make sense... apparently not :)
[12:28:35] <ch3mical> shiftins: Global event object?
[12:28:46] <shiftins> let me see
[12:29:17] <systemfault> ries: Why not just .next() ?
[12:29:17] <ch3mical> kborchers: thanks, I appreciate the assistance
[12:30:08] <kborchers> ch3mical: your map was causing issues so i took that out. changed catalogName to value which i think was the goal of your map and then messed with your _renderItem. also, i think you have to specify your own focus and select as well http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/Nj2Ur/2/
[12:30:16] <ries> systemfault: if that works, it's good for me.. I am not so much of a jquery guru and know what functions there are available (for some reason my IDE doesn't do auto-completion)
[12:30:17] <ries> ç
[12:31:57] <ch3mical> ries: I don't know of any editor that autocompletes jQuery functions, just FYI
[12:32:01] <orolo> anyone know a way to discover if a string includes a url and then make that a hyperlink based on itself?
[12:32:37] <ch3mical> orolo: use .match and .replace and refer to http://regular-expressions.info for how to match a URL
[12:32:52] <orolo> ch3mical: thanks.
[12:32:58] <tbranyen> orolo: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-replacetext-plugin/
[12:33:23] <ch3mical> tbranyen: overkill
[12:33:50] <tbranyen> ch3mical: depending on where he's doing that, its most certaintly not overkill
[12:34:12] <tbranyen> but thats cool your foresight grants you such immeasurable confidence to call it overkill
[12:34:12] <ch3mical> To each his own
[12:34:29] <ch3mical> Wow, testy
[12:34:33] <ries> ch3mical: properly a stupid question, but where can I read what functions are available?
[12:34:52] <ch3mical> ries: api.jquery.com
[12:36:08] <zanberdo> I have a question about using blockUI. I'm trying to call $.blockUI from within a function but I continue to get an error "$.blockUI is not a function", yet I can verify that I'm loading both jquery and blockUI scripts. I'm not sure what more I need to be looking for to resolve this.
[12:36:43] <ries> ch3mical: ok, now it makes sense :)
[12:36:56] <ch3mical> :)
[12:39:27] <orolo> thanks for the help: stumbled on this: http://jmrware.com/articles/2010/linkifyurl/linkify.html
[12:40:26] <ch3mical> Np
[12:41:51] <KuW8t> after "data = $('.TextMBlack').parents('table:first').html(data);" the data.length is 0... but there is a hit! what happens here!?!
[12:45:38] <impi> hello #jquery. is there a way that i can run my functions with .delegate on page load? i find it difficult to choose my events...clicks here hovers there..
[12:45:42] <kborchers> ch3mical: here you go http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/Nj2Ur/6/
[12:46:30] <ch3mical> Awesome, thanks :)
[12:46:57] <ch3mical> So what part of this explains why I couldn't get it working? Was it the focus/select events?
[12:48:07] <kborchers> ch3mical: focus/select, _renderItem was a little off, and you were using $.map incorrectly so your array was messed up causing the object has no function "source" error or what ever it said
[12:49:04] <ch3mical> kborchers: strange, I had testing the map function outside of this and it was producing the object array seemingly perfect
[12:49:11] <ch3mical> I wonder what the difference there is
[12:49:22] <erichynds> impi: trigger() then event after you bind it
[12:49:24] <ch3mical> Between using this or n (as in your example)
[12:50:25] <impi> erichynds, thanks man, i was reading over trigger but when you said it now the penny dropped
[12:50:34] <kborchers> ch3mical: yeah, not sure. logging your array looked ok but caused the error. i think there was something wierd with the objects' prototypes in the array but couldn't track down exactly what. just followed the docs for map and it worked ;)
[12:50:42] * erichynds picks up the penny
[12:50:49] <impi> lol
[12:50:51] <ch3mical> Ah.. interesting
[12:51:23] <ch3mical> Thanks again
[12:51:26] <kborchers> np
[12:55:20] <err0r_> hello, is there a way of jquery to detect the hover of an select form option?
[12:56:28] <kborchers> err0r_: i don't think that works but you can always try it and see ?hover
[12:56:29] <bot-t> err0r_, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[12:57:53] <err0r_> do you know if its possible to add a background image to a select option kborchers?
[12:58:41] <impi> mmm i think i dont understand something, i have a function that fires on page load: this one: http://pastebin.com/qBkvAecM but now how will i run that function with delegate? do i use trigger on page load, to call a click which then get's picked up by deletgate?
[12:59:03] <kborchers> err0r_: don't think so natively but see http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu Still in development but you can start from there and build it yourself
[13:00:02] <ries> is this the recommended way to copy the contents of one div to a other? $('#productpreview').html($('myOtherDiv').html());
[13:00:12] <ries> I am currently having some flickker going on
[13:00:20] <kborchers> ?clone @ ries
[13:00:20] <bot-t> ries, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[13:00:36] <ries> let me try that...
[13:09:31] <ch3mical> kborchers: for some reason when I implement your example into practice, it's poping up the list, but I can't select anything
[13:10:24] <ries> Hmmm same flicker
[13:11:26] <impi> if i have my counter function, and i have named it headerCounter, and i do my ajax calls, how can i call headerCounter(); afterwards? at the moment i get headerCounter is not defined
[13:11:46] <kborchers> ch3mical: hmm, you have a link i can see?
[13:11:57] <kborchers> ries: same question ^^
[13:12:03] <ch3mical> kborchers: also, items are appearing that don't match the entered text
[13:12:08] <ries> kborchers: reading back...
[13:12:20] <ch3mical> kborchers: I'll have to put it on jsfiddle, hold on
[13:12:32] <kborchers> ch3mical: ok
[13:12:40] <kborchers> ?demo @ ries
[13:12:40] <bot-t> ries, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:13:54] <ries> kborchers: I see what the problems is already, it's the image that isn't loaded yet and thus doesn't have a size
[13:16:21] <ch3mical> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/Nj2Ur/7/ oddly enough, it's even worse in jsfiddle, the ui styles aren't being applied to the list
[13:16:55] <ch3mical> kborchers: it's when you mouse over the list that non-matching items get inserted
[13:17:14] <kborchers> ch3mical: that's just because you have to include the css in resources (the styles part)
[13:17:25] <ch3mical> It worked before
[13:17:31] <ch3mical> Oh
[13:17:33] <ch3mical> Hmm
[13:17:34] <kborchers> cuz i added them ;)
[13:17:49] <sadmicrowave> testicles
[13:18:25] <ch3mical> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/Nj2Ur/8/
[13:19:06] <kborchers> ch3mical: what are you trying to do here $('#test').autocomplete("search", $(this).val()); in focus?
[13:19:21] <kborchers> that is what's breaking it
[13:19:32] <err0r_> why doesn't this work? $("option").hover($("#test").print($(this).attr("id")));
[13:19:40] <ch3mical> That pops up the list when you focus the input (or used to until I/we started messing with mapped values)
[13:19:49] <err0r_> <option id="lol">Test</option>
[13:19:58] <kborchers> ?hover @ err0r_
[13:19:58] <bot-t> err0r_, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[13:20:00] <ch3mical> ?print
[13:20:01] <bot-t> ch3mical, Print | jQuery Plugins - GridNic is a simple jQuery plugin for the people who needs listings on their websites. It supports AJAX, paging, sorting and supported by many output options like Printer, MS Word, MS Excel, Acroba... http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/print
[13:20:09] <kborchers> err0r_: you're doing it wrong
[13:20:24] <err0r_> how would i do this kborchers?
[13:20:32] <ch3mical> err0r_: see ?hover
[13:20:33] <bot-t> err0r_, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[13:20:34] <kborchers> ?rtfm @ err0r_
[13:20:34] <bot-t> err0r_, http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page is your friend
[13:21:29] <err0r_> i understand that but i dont understand how to print the element in the div of the id?
[13:22:19] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, lol rtfm
[13:23:16] <sadmicrowave> I like how the bot's reply was somewhat more politically correct
[13:23:34] <kborchers> err0r_: you have to provide to functions to hover, that's your first problem. second problem, print doesn't exist and i don't get what you're trying to do there
[13:23:52] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: yeah, the bot keeps me from cursing directly at people ;)
[13:24:02] <sadmicrowave> lol, always a good thing
[13:24:20] <err0r_> basically when someone hovers over each option, i want it to show an image beside the select form element, each select will have a different imge
[13:24:36] <sadmicrowave> .show() .hide()
[13:24:52] <kborchers> err0r_: ^^^
[13:25:11] <kborchers> but that only works if you can actually bind hover to option elements which i don't think you can
[13:25:11] <err0r_> i need it to be dynamic though, so id will have the image name in it
[13:25:18] <sadmicrowave> err0r_, or, .css('display','block')/.css('display','none')
[13:25:42] <sadmicrowave> err0r_, $( myVar ).hide()
[13:25:48] <bodisiw> i'm trying to specify Accept: text/json in my $.ajax call, yet somehow Chrome seems to send 'Accept: */*' anyway... any ideas?
[13:27:12] <kborchers> bodisiw: are you using Accept or accepts (accepts is the correct option)
[13:27:56] <sadmicrowave> kborchers++ I just looked that up
[13:28:24] <bodisiw> kborchers, actually im using accepts: 'text/javascript' as well as headers: {'Accept': 'text/javascript'}
[13:28:46] <Matt`> would it be considered a bug if .slideUp() / .slideDown() does exactly the same as .hide() / .show()?
[13:28:49] <bodisiw> kborchers, along with dataType: 'jsonp', which seems to override my accepts parameter...
[13:29:32] <kborchers> bodisiw: hmmm, i've never messed with accepts so not sure what's up there
[13:30:43] <phlp> bodisiw: try accepts: { js: 'text/javascript' }
[13:31:38] <bodisiw> phlp, still sends 'Accept: */*' :-/
[13:33:03] <klj613> rather than using /qualifications?type=HE then /qualifications?type=FE etc. if i get all the objects using JSON, what is a appropriate way to filter them?
[13:34:24] <kborchers> ch3mical: sorry got distracted. you are confusing your focuses, or is it focusi :p  ... http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/Nj2Ur/9/
[13:34:38] <kborchers> or foci
[13:34:42] <kborchers> whatever
[13:35:25] <phlp> bodisiw: accepts: { 'jsonp': 'text/javascript' }
[13:35:38] <sadmicrowave> gotta love typo's that result in emoticons.. (:{)
[13:35:46] <sadmicrowave> just did that in another room
[13:35:47] <sadmicrowave> lol
[13:35:59] <ch3mical> kborchers: Oh, no shit.. I'm surprized I did that
[13:36:01] <ch3mical> lol
[13:36:01] <bodisiw> phlp, no effect :-/
[13:36:07] <Vendethiel> Why jQuery.UI.Datepicker.fn.setDate()
[13:36:16] <Vendethiel> resets yearRange ?
[13:36:42] <deanclkclk> question re .removeClass
[13:37:04] <deanclkclk> if I'm using toggleClass inside an onClick event
[13:37:37] <ch3mical> kborchers: the only thing not working now is when I select something the value in the input isn't setting. lol
[13:37:42] <deanclkclk> before the onclick...there's a  $('#test').addClass("test") right
[13:39:08] <kborchers> ch3mical: hmmm
[13:39:45] <kborchers> deanclkclk: huh?
[13:40:04] <ch3mical> I know why
[13:40:13] <ch3mical> It's not ui.item.value it's just ui.item
[13:40:43] <kborchers> ch3mical: doh!
[13:40:46] <sadmicrowave> ch3mical, ui.item.value is undefined
[13:40:59] <ch3mical> sadmicrowave: way ahead of you :) thansk though
[13:41:02] <ch3mical> thanks*
[13:41:07] <sadmicrowave> fo sho
[13:42:47] <Matt`> what the hell
[13:43:06] <Matt`> why does fadeIn() work fine while slideDown() just shows the content?
[13:43:24] <ch3mical> kborchers: ok, so now that that works... the problem with ui.item is that now I don't have the value of guid, which was the point of the mapping.. how do we get ui.item to = the object, not just the value from the object
[13:43:24] <ch3mical> ?
[13:43:57] <ch3mical> Basically I need to use that value in the select event
[13:44:04] <ch3mical> ui.item.guid
[13:44:56] <kborchers> ch3mical: change item.value in the first data call in _renderItem to just item. then change your select back to ui.item.guid
[13:45:07] <ch3mical> kborchers: ah ok
[13:45:23] <ch3mical> Got it
[13:45:26] <kborchers> or back to ui.item.value if you want the value displayed but guid will be accessible for somethin else
[13:45:56] <roger_padactor> can you do $div.children('div.myclass a'); ?  If you can its not working for me :)
[13:46:31] <ch3mical> kborchers: yeah that's what I did. Thanks
[13:46:44] <ch3mical> And NOW it works beautifully
[13:47:03] * kborchers cheers
[13:47:12] <ch3mical> Thanks a mil
[13:47:15] <kborchers> np
[13:47:49] <ch3mical> I also changed the focus event to focus and click, in case you were wondering, so the input doubles as a select in functionality
[13:49:01] <klj613> http://jsfiddle.net/zY2Jk/ <-- why filter not working? either displays 0 or 25 altho i dno where 25 coming from
[13:49:16] <kborchers> ch3mical: so keyboard focus works, makes sense
[13:49:27] <kborchers> you shouldn't need click though
[13:49:35] <kborchers> focus is focus
[13:49:50] <ch3mical> With focus it only showed the list when you first click it, not on a subsequent click (without bluring first)
[13:50:03] <kborchers> duh, ok that makes sense
[13:50:08] <ch3mical> :)
[13:51:04] <kborchers> though, you may want to change your search val to "" otherwise, i think the menu will be limited to an already selected item if they click again
[13:51:09] <ch3mical> Also, this: http://goo.gl/m2wqv
[13:52:42] * klj613 feels invisible ;D
[13:52:52] <ngharo> klj613: qualifications is not an array
[13:53:13] <ngharo> in fact its all fubard
[13:53:18] <nohorse> I'm trying to edit the icons-18-white.png sprite file to hange the colors from white to grey.  when i do new file is all pixilated.  I'm ising PIMG to edit the file.  have we see this before?
[13:53:25] <ngharo> should be [{type:"HE"},{type:"FE"}]
[13:53:25] <rubyruy> what's the most idiomatic way to check if a jQuery result is empty for use in if statements?
[13:53:32] <rubyruy> just $(...).length > 0 ?
[13:53:35] <nohorse> ... to change the colors...
[13:53:36] <ngharo> rubyruy: length, yes
[13:53:49] <kborchers> rubyruy: just .length as 0 is falsy
[13:53:58] <rubyruy> rightoh
[13:54:02] <rubyruy> it doesn't read as nice :(
[13:54:29] <klj613> ngharo: first time using jsfiddle, and my json is loaded via http request which is on LAN (development..) -.- etc
[13:54:54] <ngharo> klj613: well that's not valid json
[13:54:59] <kborchers> i guess, but it's an unnecessary comparison rubyruy
[13:55:11] <rubyruy> no i mean checking length
[13:55:32] <rubyruy> it offends my dainty aesthetic sensibilities! :p
[13:56:06] <ngharo> $.fn.nil? = function() { return this.length; }
[13:56:08] <ngharo> or somethin
[13:56:15] <rubyruy> $(...).empty or a boolean-returning version of .filter() or something... not acutally worth bothering with too much
[13:56:21] <rubyruy> just checking there wasn't something i was missing
[13:56:36] <wesbos> ao. Is it possible to bind to an element within an iframe? same domain of course
[13:57:16] <ryanneufeld> wesbos: you'd need to do it from within the iframe itself
[13:58:03] <sadmicrowave> wesbos, within the js for the page inside the iframe...
[13:58:21] <wesbos> ryanneufeld sadmicrowave dang, I dont have access to that page
[13:58:29] <sadmicrowave> sol then
[13:58:31] <wesbos> .contents() can only change style
[13:58:34] <wesbos> right?
[13:59:28] <sadmicrowave> how is .contents() different from .html()
[13:59:29] <sadmicrowave> ?
[13:59:50] <sadmicrowave> (I've never used .contents so I'm not being sarcastic)
[13:59:54] <dimitris5> can you help me debug a javascript slider? for some reason scroll bars appear. Here it is http://home.dakulov.eu:85/ituts.gr/
[14:00:08] <wesbos> sadmicrowave .contents can get the dom of a iframe http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[14:00:32] <sadmicrowave> and .html() wont do that also?
[14:01:07] <sadmicrowave> hmm
[14:01:40] <gp5st> $("iframe").contents().find("#settings_form") isn't finding settings_form. contents returns a Document, the markup looks fine, i'm not sure what i'm doing wrong
[14:02:18] <ngharo> ($("iframe").contents()).find( ... ) mayhaps
[14:02:27] <ngharo> $($("iframe").contents()).find( ... ) oops
[14:02:35] <gp5st> hmmm
[14:03:29] <wesbos> sadmicrowave I think its so tou can manipulate the iframe
[14:03:49] <wesbos> sadmicrowave check the demo: http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[14:03:52] <gp5st> no, that didn't work ngharo
[14:04:08] <sadmicrowave> wesbos, I was looking at that already, interesting
[14:04:26] <gp5st> it's wrapped in a $('iframe').ready(function(){ ... }); sorry, i'm still learning jquery:-\
[14:04:35] <sadmicrowave> I hate iframes and avoid using them, so I'm not going to be much help
[14:04:52] <gp5st> i do to, but the guy who wrote this used them:-\
[14:05:17] <wesbos> sadmicrowave yeahh :\ they have their place and this is a situation where I need to use one
[14:05:37] <sadmicrowave> well good luck
[14:05:59] <wesbos> sadmicrowave thanks, I'll let you know if its possible, somehow i dont think it is
[14:06:06] <sadmicrowave> if anyone has the answer it'll be the peeps in here
[14:06:52] <wesbos> Just googled it and found my own stackoverflow question :|
[14:07:27] <sadmicrowave> paste it in here, maybe someone can help if they have more code to view
[14:07:37] <wesbos> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6782447/bind-to-element-within-an-iframe-same-domain
[14:07:57] <wesbos> I wonder if I can bind to a local link and then trigger a fake click within the iframe..
[14:08:38] <sadmicrowave> you said its on the same domain?
[14:08:55] <wesbos> yep
[14:09:12] <sadmicrowave> why is it that you don't have access to the iframe page's script?
[14:10:23] <wesbos> working for a client with fairly tight security
[14:10:54] <ryanneufeld> And you want to manipulate the contents of an iframe for them
[14:10:59] <ryanneufeld> conflicting ideas methings
[14:11:02] <ryanneufeld> *thinks
[14:11:02] <gp5st> this is maddening, there are no errors, the iframe seems to be loaded correctly:(
[14:11:04] <sadmicrowave> lol
[14:11:12] <phlp> wesbos: http://jsfiddle.net/aLFp9
[14:11:15] <sadmicrowave> wesbos, hmm, well, as said before, good luck
[14:11:32] <wesbos> phlp yeah css works, but does it bind?
[14:11:51] <gp5st> how do i know if it's actually getting the right contents or if it's just returning a blank doc
[14:12:07] <gp5st> a blank doc would make sense, but i don't know it would
[14:12:49] <wesbos> phlp http://jsfiddle.net/aLFp9/2/ oo
[14:12:51] <phlp> http://jsfiddle.net/aLFp9/3
[14:13:03] <phlp> ;)
[14:13:17] <thebignoise> var tags = ["funny", "cool", "nice"]. but i can call .each on tags anyone know why?
[14:13:26] <thebignoise> can't call*
[14:13:43] <wesbos> phlp okay so its possible, just need to apply to mine which is a dynamically loaded iframe
[14:13:46] <wesbos> thanks guyzzz
[14:14:02] <gnarf> thebignoise: $.each( tags, ...
[14:14:13] <gnarf> thebignoise: array's don't have a function "each"
[14:14:18] <gnarf> thats why you can't call it
[14:14:18] <phlp> wesbos: i cant get it to work with the full path, even if it's the same domain. maybe it has to be relative?
[14:14:21] <thebignoise> gnarf: ah! yes now i remember. THANK YOU
[14:14:58] * gnarf knocked that one out of the park!! *raises hands and runs around the bases, pointing out friends in the stands along the way*
[14:15:00] <wesbos> phlp ahh that might be it..
[14:15:14] <wesbos> hrmmmm
[14:15:16] <gp5st> i guess it just wasn't waiting long enough:-\
[14:15:32] <thebignoise> gnarf: wait but that treats tags as one object
[14:15:47] <gnarf> thebignoise: are you trying to use "this"
[14:15:52] <thebignoise> and return the whole array.
[14:15:53] <gnarf> cuz if you are
[14:15:55] <thebignoise> gnarf: nope
[14:16:03] <gnarf> of course it returns the whole array
[14:16:04] <gnarf> ?each
[14:16:05] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/

Other objects are iterated via their named properties. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[14:16:42] <thebignoise> gnarf: well shit how to i make it an iterate-able object
[14:16:44] <thebignoise> or can't you
[14:16:59] <gnarf> ?js var tags = ["funny", "cool", "nice"]; $.each( tags, function( index, tag ) { console.log("gnarf is "+ tag ); });
[14:17:00] <bot-t> gnarf: "gnarf is funny""gnarf is cool""gnarf is nice"["funny", "cool", "nice"]
[14:17:09] <gnarf> note the final array is the return value
[14:17:13] <gnarf> what are you expecting?
[14:17:54] <thebignoise> gnarf: thats works great. but why is the purpose of the index argument?
[14:18:05] <thebignoise> key value type thing
[14:18:13] <grid_> hey
[14:18:13] <thebignoise> ?
[14:18:15] <gnarf> ?js var tags = ["funny", "cool", "nice"]; $.each( tags, function( index, tag ) { console.log("gnarf is "+ tag); });
[14:18:16] <bot-t> gnarf: "gnarf is funny""gnarf is cool""gnarf is nice"["funny", "cool", "nice"]
[14:18:18] <gnarf> yeah
[14:18:22] <gnarf> 0,1,2
[14:18:30] <gnarf> you can use $.each on objects too
[14:18:36] <thebignoise> gnarf: very cool thank you
[14:19:36] <gnarf> ?js $.each({ thebignoise: "learning", gnarf: "teaching", ajpiano: "lurking" }, function( idx, val ) { console.log( idx + " is " + val ); });

[14:20:07] <thebignoise> gnarf: LOL
[14:20:15] <ajpiano> it's true

[14:20:32] <thebignoise> gnarf: ah yes!
[14:20:36] <gnarf> and "narf" was what pinky from pinky and the brain said
[14:20:43] <ryanneufeld> narf
[14:20:52] <ryanneufeld> are you thinking what I'm thinking Pinky?
[14:20:55] <gnarf> gnarf is just my last name backwads, cuz I'm old school like that
[14:21:14] <gnarf> backwards*
[14:21:28] <ryanneufeld> frang?
[14:21:31] <gnarf> if coldhead were awake, he'd joke about my last name being "backwads" now
[14:21:42] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: good to know you can read backwards
[14:21:44] <gnarf> :)
[14:21:51] <ryanneufeld> do I win something?
[14:22:16] <gnarf> nope
[14:24:32] <ryanneufeld> daw
[14:24:35] <ryanneufeld> that's not fun
[14:24:43] <ryanneufeld> this should be fun
[14:25:05] <ryanneufeld> frang is an interesting last name, never seen it that way before
[14:25:38] <ryanneufeld> that one
[14:29:30] <wesbos> sadmicrowave phlp woo, got it :)
[14:31:32] <wesbos> It had to to with triggering it on the ready event for the iframe
[14:31:54] <hadees> I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong here, http://pastie.org/private/ucvzv6pcfbcc3sxjyk9g  i've put in a bunch of alerts and I can never get the code to run when I change the select
[14:32:44] <mrittman> hey guys I'm trying to get an Animated Collapsible Div script to work
[14:32:53] <mrittman> http://www.info2gousa.com/displaypress
[14:33:17] <mrittman> on that page if you click on Packages on the right sidebar
[14:33:36] <mrittman> where it says "This text should be hidden"
[14:33:47] <mrittman> and the toggle doesn't work
[14:34:33] <mrittman> any geniuses wanna check it out?
[14:34:45] <garbagegod> hey guys, if you look at http://wilsoncomputer.com/staging/w/s/ and you click on (2) computer repair near the fold you see how its transitioning
[14:35:02] <garbagegod> how can i stop it from doing that and have the second one slide in aligned to the first one?
[14:37:49] <garbagegod> anyone
[14:37:52] <garbagegod> cmon gaize :3
[14:39:55] <SinnerNyx> is there some jquery method that will take an entire form and give me a data string in preparation for an ajax request?
[14:40:26] <djQuery> ?.serialize@sinnernyx
[14:40:26] <bot-t> sinnernyx, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[14:40:38] <SinnerNyx> wow, that's perfect
[14:40:44] <SinnerNyx> thx djQuery
[14:40:50] <djQuery> SinnerNyx: theres also see ?serializearray
[14:40:50] <bot-t> SinnerNyx, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[14:40:55] <danheberden> SinnerNyx you might also like
[14:40:59] <danheberden> ?serializeObject
[14:40:59] <bot-t> Whereas jQuery’s built-in .serializeArray() method serializes a form into an array, .serializeObject() serializes a form into an (arguably more useful) object. http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#serializeobject
[14:41:25] <danheberden> garbagegod perhaps you should see ?slides
[14:41:26] <bot-t> danheberden, slides | jQuery Plugins - jQuery.slideBanjo - is a plugin, that shows pretty slides at your site. http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/slides
[14:41:33] <SinnerNyx> :S o wow. that's alot. I really only need the form for now, but i'll prolly need those in the future
[14:43:17] <djQuery> danheberden: nice code on that
[14:43:26] <djQuery> should be very fast
[14:43:38] <danheberden> djQuery heh, this should be faster
[14:43:44] <danheberden> ?g danheberden serializeObject
[14:43:45] <bot-t> danheberden, jQuery Plugin: .serializeObject() | danheberden - http://danheberden.com/jquery-plugin-serializeobject-2011-04-01/
[14:44:07] <djQuery> danheberden: it was the serializeobject source that I was lookin at
[14:44:40] <danheberden> djQuery ya, ben's uses $.param - mine doesn't
[14:44:43] <danheberden> two different plugins
[14:47:21] <RichardLynch> Backend guy here. Be gentle.  Any idea how our former former former front-end vendor managed to make the "Program Overview" tab here http://www.purdueonlineprograms.com/landing not flip into sight on IE8?
[14:47:34] <RichardLynch> The jQuery looks reasonable to these naive eyes, but I'm lost at sea here.
[14:47:56] <garbagegod> danheberden: slides?
[14:48:04] <geekbuntu> backend? o.0
[14:48:32] <garbagegod> geekbuntu: he means PHP > any form of js
[14:49:04] <RichardLynch> I write PHP and validated HTML with "wire-frame quality" css.  Somebody with layout skills can skin it any way they want...
[14:49:28] <garbagegod> yeah, us backend guys gotta stick together...
[14:49:33] * garbagegod high fives RichardLynch
[14:49:53] <RichardLynch> Alas, they've made me use Drupal and keep hiring vendors who are even more challenged than I, and that's saying something....
[14:50:12] <danheberden> RichardLynch i think you've found the source of your problems
[14:50:39] <RichardLynch> I've toyed with jQuery, and like how it brings order out of chaos, but ...  No clue why this wouldn't "just work"
[14:51:10] <garbagegod> so does anyone know whats up with my issue?
[14:51:18] <garbagegod> its probably alot simpler than Richards :P
[14:51:22] <RichardLynch> They have a new guy who seems to be competent.  He's neck-deep in other bigger problems, and they need this fixed today, so turned to me out of sheer desperation. :-)
[14:51:22] <geekbuntu> garbagegod, phew....
[14:52:39] <garbagegod> nobody D:
[14:53:07] <garbagegod> its probably something everybody who is moderately experienced with js known
[14:53:10] <garbagegod> knows*
[14:53:20] <RichardLynch> I might as well take a shot at it, while I'm here... :-) restate?
[14:53:37] <thebignoise> is there a way to remove something from the end of a string
[14:54:12] <thebignoise> im updating an input field but the last part of the string. it looks like text, text, text, text,
[14:54:15] <RichardLynch> thebignoise: Google for javascript substring?
[14:54:17] <thebignoise> i dont want that last ','
[14:54:19] <garbagegod> RichardLynch: http://wilsoncomputer.com/staging/w/s/ if you click on computer repair near the fold i want to make it stop transitioning underneath the other one...
[14:56:06] <danheberden> ?eval "test, test, test,".slice(0,-1);
[14:56:07] <bot-t> danheberden: "test, test, test"
[14:56:15] <danheberden> thebignoise ^
[14:56:31] <phlp> RichardLynch: if you replace $(".tab-content2").show() with this $(".tab-content2").show().children().eq(1).show() the tab will show up on ie8
[14:56:39] <thebignoise> danheberden: ah very cool thanx
[14:57:17] <Mass^Zero> Hey people, I have a quick question; Is there any way to instantly hide something on page load, so it's not even shown shortly? IE seems to not want to do that when using .css("display","none"). :<
[14:58:06] <RichardLynch> Mass^Zero: You'd have to have it be display: none; in html/css BEFORE your jQuery kicks in, I should think...
[14:58:07] <scorphus> Mass^Zero: style="display: none;"
[14:58:17] <danheberden> Mass^Zero if that css rule isn't working for you, you got something else messing it up
[14:58:39] <Mass^Zero> Yes, but... if I do it in actual CSS/HTML, people blocking JS won't get the content.
[14:58:54] <Mass^Zero> As I slide it
[14:58:56] <danheberden> ?modernizr @ Mass^Zero
[14:58:57] <bot-t> Mass^Zero, a feature detection javascript library that determines support for all sorts of html5 and css3 goodness. http://modernizr.com
[14:58:57] <Mass^Zero> To make it visible
[14:59:06] <Mass^Zero> :O
[14:59:08] * Mass^Zero checks
[14:59:10] <danheberden> .no-js .whatever { display:block }
[14:59:16] <danheberden> .js .whatever { display:none; }
[14:59:38] <danheberden> or however you kids are doin it these days
[14:59:42] <RichardLynch> Mass^Zero: What percentage of people surf these days without JS?... I have no idea really.
[14:59:56] <Mass^Zero> Well, my best bud is one of those guys. :P
[15:00:01] <Mass^Zero> And danheberden, thanks, I'll try.
[15:00:44] <danheberden> Mass^Zero you could also build the js part as easy as $(document).ready( function() { $( document.body ).removeClass('no-js') }); or something
[15:01:00] <danheberden> and add the class no-js to your body tag
[15:02:18] <RichardLynch> phlp: WIll try that.  THANK YOU!!!
[15:02:53] <stuffmc> Hi
[15:03:13] <stuffmc> funny enough, I just discovered "alert()" in jQuery :-)
[15:03:28] <ngharo> 0_o
[15:03:30] <stuffmc> i had always used console.write and fauxconsole on IE
[15:03:37] <stuffmc> but how do you clear it?
[15:03:53] <stuffmc> like ⌘ K in the console
[15:04:18] <ngharo> huh
[15:04:26] <stuffmc> otherwhise lines are just adding and adding and adding
[15:04:51] <ngharo> non crappy browsers have a clear button on the console
[15:05:41] <danheberden> um - alert in jquery?
[15:05:58] <ryanneufeld> ?jsisjs @stuffmc
[15:05:59] <bot-t> stuffmc, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[15:06:13] <ryanneufeld> alert is one of those
[15:09:14] <stuffmc> ryanneufeld: you're actually not answering my question at all :D
[15:09:26] <stuffmc> all I want to know is a simple way to clear this "alert"
[15:09:36] <stuffmc> of course I can look for the html node and remove it…
[15:09:38] <ryanneufeld> click on the okay button
[15:09:51] <ryanneufeld> alert() is a native window for the browser
[15:10:14] <ryanneufeld> and it halts the execution of your script
[15:10:29] <ryanneufeld> there is no alert in jQuery
[15:10:47] <stuffmc> $("alertbox").remove() for example
[15:11:06] <ryanneufeld> stuffmc: I think you're confused
[15:11:07] <djQuery> ?ftjq
[15:11:07] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[15:11:09] <RichardLynch> stuffmc: In theory, you could find the node that has the JS that has the alert and change the innerHTML to alter the JS to not have the alert...  I think.
[15:11:25] <stuffmc> maybe it's a plugin in the project
[15:11:33] <RichardLynch> stuffmc: But your better bet is to find the alert() in your source and get rid of it there....
[15:11:55] <ryanneufeld> stuffmc: it is possible that someone has overridden the alert() function
[15:12:01] <ryanneufeld> which is very naughty of them
[15:12:14] * djQuery waggles finger
[15:13:51] <stuffmc> yeah maybe… but I found what I was looking for
[15:13:56] <stuffmc> ttyl guys….
[15:14:01] <stuffmc> thanks.
[15:14:41] <danheberden> remove alerts with js- kids these days
[15:17:19] <ngharo> wonder what he found
[15:17:24] <ngharo> probably confirm() hah
[15:19:53] <thebignoise> im using $.post -- the file I am posting too i want to be able to use a redirect in that is it possible
[15:20:14] <thebignoise> b/c right now it just adds the redirected page to the current page
[15:21:12] <ngharo> set window.location.href in your $.post callback to point to your new url
[15:21:38] <ngharo> but really, you'd may as well not even use ajax then
[15:22:05] <thebignoise> ngharo: yeah ik but the way i have finagled it i see no other way
[15:29:54] <thebignoise> is there a way to only use part of $.post data that gets returned?
[15:36:30] <alphabravo> Hi. quick question: when using slideDown, do i have to do something initially to keep a div hidden? i want it to slidedown on click, but the div is show when the page loads. any help?
[15:38:46] <danheberden> alphabravo hide it via your css? e.g. display:none
[15:40:13] <alphabravo> thanks....that was simple i feel kinda stupid i didn't think of that lol
[15:46:42] <miwillhite> hi
[15:47:17] <miwillhite> I'd like to fire an ajax request…then only fire subsequent requests after it has returned…whats the best way to go about that?
[15:47:48] <miwillhite> my first thought is to make all calls synchronous until that one finishes, then set back to async…but I don't like that
[15:49:35] <miwillhite> nm, I have an idea
[16:06:04] <rocksprout> $('input[name]:nth-child(5)') doesn't seem to take?  can I put ':' after ']'?
[16:12:36] <bobbobbins> hey, can someone help me out...i have 3 vars, metrics, intervals and years...metrics seems to be ok, but intervals and years puts a null value in the first spot of the array and i can't figure out why: http://jsfiddle.net/4tc3c/1/
[16:12:57] <iguana007> hello everyone
[16:14:12] <asymetrixs> is there a place for feature requesting? i need the datepicker to be configureable for something like: dateOrientation = 'UTC/client/GMT+1)' and so on. so that the client date is overwritten by the setting made
[16:15:02] <rocksprout> asymetrixs, yes please :>
[16:15:07] <Techdeck> hey guys, what's the difference between keyUp and keyDown?
[16:15:49] <Prometheus> Techdeck: one is triggered when you press a key down, and the other when the key is released? :o
[16:16:16] <Techdeck> up is why it's released?
[16:16:18] <Techdeck> when*
[16:16:26] <iguana007> can anyone please help me, with JSON parsing? https://gist.github.com/8d6397fc2c06e59cb075
[16:16:34] <bobbobbins> any help, i can't see it for the life of me
[16:18:08] <asymetrixs> rocksprout, you know what i mean? with currentDate i can overwrite the initial value, but today is friday 1 am, jul 22. and UTC is thursday 23 am jul 21, to the 'today' value shown by the datepicker is the client date, but i'd like to be it the UTC 'today'
[16:20:14] <saimon69> greetings, do anybody have problem with jquery, jQl firefox 5 and caching?
[16:21:33] <rocksprout> you can always do $().datepicker().click(function(){set_date_on_click})
[16:22:01] <rocksprout> unless I got you all wrong :>
[16:22:59] <asymetrixs> hm i just want the highlight of today set on UTC today, not client today :)
[16:23:22] <asymetrixs> the highlight of the field, so datepicker must think, it's base is utc not local client time
[16:23:33] <iguana007> can anyone please help me, with JSON parsing? https://gist.github.com/8d6397fc2c06e59cb075
[16:23:40] <rocksprout> ah :/  weird.. that should be a bug :>
[16:23:47] <rocksprout> get more attention that way too
[16:24:22] <rocksprout> oh wait... you *want* a bug.   see, I'm here to get help, not give it.  <remembers his place>

[16:26:37] <asymetrixs> ah lol :D
[16:27:09] <timrc> question: I'm trying out the menubar() widget and I'm getting "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'nodeType' of undefined" for menu items with only a top level item -- has anyone else seen this?
[16:27:16] <AaronJake> Hey, can someone help me for a minute im kinda stuck >_<
[16:28:43] <iguana007> saimon69: seems to be ok
[16:28:45] <saimon69> in my ff 5.0.1 jquery got loaded last not first and all scripts stop working despite the jQl
[16:29:01] <AaronJake> Is it possible to place a Jquery popup over a Jquery image roundabout? I can show you my design if required.. Would appreciate it if someone could show me my mistake as its been bugging me for the past hour.
[16:29:12] <iguana007> saimon69: try disable ff plugins
[16:29:34] <iguana007> can anyone please help me, with JSON parsing? https://gist.github.com/8d6397fc2c06e59cb075
[16:30:14] <saimon69> trying now
[16:30:40] <AaronJake> Saimon69, any chance you could assist me with my problem :\
[16:31:55] <iguana007> saimon69: maybe your problem is in that jQl thing
[16:33:09] <chovy> what's a good way to fade content in when using replaceWith( htm ); ?
[16:33:32] <chovy> i tried el.hide().replaceWith( htm ).fadeIn(); but that was ignored.
[16:33:43] <AaronJake> Question - Is it possible to place a Jquery popup over a Jquery image roundabout? I can show you my design if required.. Would appreciate it if someone could show me my mistake as its been bugging me for the past hour.
[16:36:15] <saimon69> well what is the roundabout?
[16:37:28] <saimon69> iguana007: now main script works with add-on off wonder what might ocnflict
[16:37:50] <AaronJake> saimon69: Its easier to show you; http://new.mmudev.info
[16:39:13] <AaronJake> the roundabout holds a number of images and on click of images which arent at the front spins round to show you the next image. Im trying to pull up a pop up from the Read More link but it seems the read more popup wont blackout the roundabout and its sitting behind it rather than over the top of it
[16:39:36] <saimon69> well you should make sure that the overlay and the popup got a z-index insanely high i guess
[16:39:58] <chovy> z-index: 1
[16:40:03] <AaronJake> how high would i be aiming for roughly?
[16:40:10] <AaronJake> z-index is set to 1 at the moment
[16:40:52] <timrc> has anyone used the jqueryui menubar ?
[16:41:14] <saimon69> pop up and overlay might say above 10000
[16:41:36] <saimon69> test on firebug with the styles until they dont stand up
[16:41:42] <Vendethiel> ITS OVER NINE THOUSANDS
[16:42:13] <AaronJake> Ah problem solved! Thank you saimon!
[16:42:51] <AaronJake> My last issue with this
[16:42:57] <AaronJake> is the background fade.
[16:43:06] <AaronJake> Im assuming z-index once again to overlay the roundabout?
[16:43:13] <chovy> if i have a string of html, is it possible to hide it before I add it to the dom?
[16:44:15] <mattp_> whats the name of that jquery minimal subset
[16:44:20] <mattp_> klepto or something? google is failing
[16:44:29] <AaronJake> All done, cheers for the help guys
[16:44:37] <saimon69> iguana007: bad luck firebug is conflicting on ff 5 :(
[16:44:53] <Vendethiel> saimon69: not here.

[16:54:46] <SinnerNyx> ok I have a grid of checkboxes. Anytime any 3 checkboxes are checked I want to disable all of the unchecked checkboxes. When one of the 3 checkboxes is unchecked I want to enable all of the checkboxes again. All the checkboxes are in a single div
[16:55:28] <SinnerNyx> I use $('.divclass input').children(':checked') to select all the checked inputs
[16:56:08] <SinnerNyx> when the length is >3, I disable all of the checkboxs not checked [$('.divclass input').children(':not(:checked)')
[16:56:50] <SinnerNyx> but when the change event is triggered on a checkbox, $('.divclass input').children(':checked') does not include the checkbox currently being selected.
[16:56:58] <SinnerNyx> how can I account for this checkbox?

[16:59:57] <SinnerNyx> when the change event of a checkbox is triggered using $(':checked') does not include the checkbox currently being checked, or does include the checkbox being unchecked. how can I fix this?

[17:04:39] <gnarf> solidus-river: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L277-407
[17:05:59] <solidus-river> k, so i have to find out where the hell the set up these handlers.. sigh.. this jquery code is a mess, they have like.. pseudo object oriented code. they split up the ui elements into classes but then they didnt really name them what they did and didn't stick to the whole object thing
[17:06:41] <coldhead> time to refactor with backbone.js?
[17:06:42] <AaronJake> Hmm..
[17:06:50] <solidus-river> are there special triggers associated with $
[17:06:54] <AaronJake> It seems i can only add one pop up in my recent news section >_<
[17:06:56] <solidus-river> * $(document)
[17:06:59] <AaronJake> Anyone know a way around this?
[17:07:06] <coldhead> use different IDs
[17:07:25] <AaronJake> So i'd need new CSS id's also?
[17:07:37] <gnarf> solidus-river: not really, all the "live" events are bound there
[17:07:39] <coldhead> maybe!
[17:07:44] <gnarf> thats kinda the only special thing
[17:07:47] <coldhead> or use classes
[17:07:50] <coldhead> you can use both
[17:07:59] <gnarf> but you can bind "global" events to $(document)
[17:08:09] <AaronJake> Id still have to add repeating code into the css for this to work though wouldnt i
[17:08:16] <gnarf> and things will bubble up to it
[17:08:32] <solidus-river> gnarf: thanks, he must do that in one of these classes
[17:11:11] <coldhead> AaronJake: repeating CSS usually means you should just be using a class
[17:11:16] <coldhead> and giving all elements that class
[17:11:31] <gnarf> or using the comma selector
[17:11:43] <coldhead> you can also give the elements IDs to distinguish them
[17:11:52] <coldhead> much as this walrus mustache distinguishes me
[17:12:03] <gnarf> coldhead's a pimp
[17:12:10] <Paganini> nice, do you use a beardtrimmer?
[17:12:23] <AaronJake> Hmm.. i tried your method coldhead, doesnt appear to work..
[17:12:30] <coldhead> aw nuts
[17:12:33] <coldhead> sorry AaronJake
[17:12:39] <coldhead> it's only my first day using jQUery
[17:12:41] <gnarf> ?p
[17:12:42] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:12:55] <coldhead> paste that shit and someone sharp like gnarf can save your bacon
[17:15:10] <AaronJake> gnarf, can you help me for a few minutes if thats possible?
[17:17:59] <AaronJake> coldhead, within saying your idea didnt work. The Jquery set up would have to be edited also. But in doing so would result in having to duplicate the file contents also..
[17:18:37] <coldhead> web stuff is hard
[17:18:48] <gnarf> ?p @AaronJake
[17:18:48] <bot-t> AaronJake, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:19:12] <AaronJake> So your idea could work but it would either require more files, or duplicating the contents and editing the title names
[17:19:34] <solidus-river> does .ajax(request) return the data gotten from the request?
[17:19:47] <AaronJake> bot-t, for which file?
[17:19:47] <bot-t> AaronJake, Yes - definitely.
[17:19:51] <coldhead> no solidus-river
[17:20:01] <gnarf> for the problem?
[17:20:02] <coldhead> you provide a function that handles that data
[17:20:10] <gnarf> AaronJake: bot-t is a bot
[17:20:12] <coldhead> and it runs when the data is available
[17:20:17] * coldhead hugs bot-t 
[17:20:17] * bot-t hugs coldhead back
[17:20:18] <AaronJake> Ah lol!
[17:20:21] <coldhead> HE HAS FEELINGS
[17:20:30] <gnarf> i never implied he didn't
[17:20:44] <gnarf> bot-t: do you have feelings?
[17:20:44] <bot-t> gnarf, Concentrate and ask again.
[17:20:48] <AaronJake> gnarf, the problem could be in 1 of 3 files.
[17:20:50] * gnarf thinks really hard
[17:20:53] <gnarf> bot-t: do you have feelings?
[17:20:54] <bot-t> gnarf, Ask again later.
[17:21:00] * gnarf gives bot-t the finger
[17:21:13] <gnarf> AaronJake: then find the problem, then ask for a solution
[17:21:35] <AaronJake> i know the issue but im not sure on the solution gnarf.
[17:21:43] <gnarf> then make a demo of the issue
[17:21:56] <gnarf> or explain it really fn well
[17:22:00] <AaronJake> http://new.mmudev.info
[17:22:07] <AaronJake> recent news section
[17:22:14] * gnarf doesn't click links that don't start with a pastebin
[17:23:07] <qom2> I have this: http://jsfiddle.net/YFgAe/ and I'm wondering how to go about to get the information into a piece of php, like this: http://pastebin.com/EPHegRPh ?
[17:23:28] <Back2Basics> anyone know of a website that will show you browser renderings of websites?  (screenshots from firefox 3,4,5, safari, chrome etc..)
[17:23:49] <coldhead> you hurt his feelings, gnard
[17:23:53] <coldhead> lol gnarfd
[17:24:31] <gnarf> qom2: not quite sure what you mean
[17:24:51] <gnarf> you mean like when you click on one it would call some php script via ajax?
[17:25:10] <qom2> nope, open the console and drag and drop in the jsfiddle
[17:25:31] <qom2> and you'll see that you'll get the id of the divs and also what position (or menu order) that they have
[17:25:50] <qom2> I need to loop through these results and post them to the backend, via the php snippet I also pasted
[17:25:59] <qom2> but I'm drawing a blank on how to do it
[17:26:08] <Back2Basics> Looking for a few good browsers.  Do you get a webpage back or a big error page when you visit http://glassroom.org  (trying to fix some language independent stuff)
[17:26:15] <gnarf> qom2: aha
[17:26:19] <saimon69> aaronjake: what exactly are you trying to build?
[17:26:27] <gnarf> qom2: there is a neat function in ui sortable called "serialize"
[17:26:36] <gnarf> but you're gonna wanna change your id's around a bit for it to work
[17:26:43] <gnarf> also starting an ID with a number is illegal ayway
[17:26:44] <gnarf> ?valid id
[17:26:45] <bot-t> ID attributes must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods ("."). http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#h-6.2 - furthermore, IDs are unique, meaning only one element in the DOM can have a given ID at any time
[17:26:55] <qom2> hm
[17:27:04] <qom2> the id is generated by wordpress, so not much I can do there
[17:27:06] <Vendethiel> id with . ?
[17:27:10] <Vendethiel> is that really a good idea ?
[17:27:20] <gnarf> might i suggest "attachment-2232" as your id
[17:27:45] <qom2> could work :)
[17:28:14] <gnarf> qom2: http://jsfiddle.net/YFgAe/
[17:28:21] <gnarf> if you do something like that
[17:28:45] <gnarf> sortable.sortable( "serialize" ) will give you a string suitable for passing to the "data" of an ajax call
[17:28:58] <gnarf> like "attachment[]=2002&attachment[]=2012"
[17:29:15] <qom2> well, I don't need ajax for this particular thing though
[17:29:20] <gnarf> PHP will pick those up as $_POST["attachment"] = array( 2002, 2012 );
[17:29:29] <gnarf> qom2: if you want to pass it to PHP you do
[17:29:36] <gnarf> or
[17:29:47] <solidus-river> does calling a div auto show it?
[17:29:54] <gnarf> a <form> on the page
[17:29:58] <gnarf> that you populate
[17:30:02] <AaronJake> saimon69, im relatively new to jquery so im just trying things out for my site
[17:30:04] <solidus-river> what could possibly the the point of this code
[17:30:15] <solidus-river> $("#some_div_element");
[17:30:36] <gnarf> to waste time solidus-river?
[17:30:43] <gnarf> is there a ; before it?
[17:30:44] <gnarf> :)
[17:31:00] <solidus-river> nope
[17:31:01] <solidus-river> lol
[17:31:02] <qom2> gnarf: even if I do a php function with the js inside?
[17:31:39] <solidus-river> is there anything wrong with calling an ajax request from an ajax request?
[17:32:32] <gnarf> qom2: of course
[17:32:39] <gnarf> qom2: js runs on the browser
[17:32:46] <gnarf> php runs on the server
[17:33:24] <qom2> right
[17:33:40] <qom2> but what about serialize, you were saying: PHP will pick those up as $_POST["attachment"] = array( 2002, 2012 );
[17:33:45] <qom2> but where does the "position" come in?
[17:34:33] <gnarf> foreach ($_POST["attachments"] as $index =>$id) {  // $index == 0; $id == "2002"; // $index == 1; $id == "2012"; }
[17:36:53] <qom2> not sure that I'm following, where did $index and $id come from?
[17:36:59] <qom2> sorry if this is basic stuff..
[17:37:09] <systemfault> more than basic..
[17:37:25] <saimon69> aaronjake: you can have a pop-up skeleton and populate it with AJAX from a DB
[17:38:16] <AaronJake> sounds interesting to have.. Ill look into that in the morning, thanks again saimon69
[17:38:57] <Paganini> apologies as I'm a novice, but I've been messing about with ajax myself and I can't quite understand how to use .submit() to gather the form information and post it back to the same page :/ I managed to get jquery to show a completed message but it didn't post correctly. Any tips?
[17:39:02] <coldhead> boo photoshop boo
[17:39:21] <erichynds> Paganini: pastie what you have so far
[17:42:17] <Parserror> Does jQuery have any array sorting methods that are "aware" of data types? For instance, if I passed it an array of dates and told it to sort them could it do it by itself or would I need to inform whatever function that they were dates?
[17:43:38] <erichynds> Parserror: jquery doesn't have a method to sort an arbitrary array
[17:43:42] <qom2> gnarf: thanks for taking time, will see if I sort things out eventually
[17:43:45] <erichynds> you have to do that urself
[17:43:51] <Paganini> http://pastie.org/2251433
[17:43:59] <gnarf> qom2: it is (basic stuff)
[17:44:04] <gnarf> qom2: don't be sorry
[17:44:15] <Parserror> erichynds: ok, thanks for clarifying
[17:44:18] <gnarf> qom2: arrays are indexed from 0 -> array's length - 1
[17:44:48] <Paganini> erichynds oops sorry I missed out "var formInput = $(this).serialize();" after the function call
[17:44:58] <erichynds> Paganini 1 sec
[17:45:07] <Paganini> thanks
[17:45:24] <gnarf> Parserror: javascript has a sort function
[17:45:31] <gnarf> ?mdc Array.sort
[17:45:33] <bot-t> gnarf, sort - MDN Docs - Sorts the elements of an array in place. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[17:46:02] <gnarf> Parserror: If compareFunction is not supplied, elements are sorted by converting them to strings and comparing strings in lexicographic ("dictionary" or "telephone book," not numerical) order. For example, "80" comes before "9" in lexicographic order, but in a numeric sort 9 comes before 80.
[17:46:36] <gnarf> so, if the string represntation of the thing you are sorting is going to sort right
[17:46:40] <gnarf> you don't need a sort fn
[17:46:45] <gnarf> otherwise you do
[17:46:56] <Parserror> gnarf: ok, awesome :)
[17:47:24] <erichynds> Paganini http://pastie.org/2251445
[17:51:23] <Paganini> erichynds, Thanks, however I don't quite understand how form works without it being declared as a dom?
[17:52:06] <erichynds> $('#contactForm') returns a jquery object which is set to the variable "form", Paganini
[17:52:48] <erichynds> in fact, you can replace $(this) with form inside the slideUp handler as well.
[17:52:54] <erichynds> they all refer to the same DOM node
[17:52:57] <Paganini> ah I see, thanks :)
[17:53:11] <Paganini> does that mean you can have multiple forms and cycle through them in a form[$i] array?
[17:53:43] <erichynds> you could modify the selector to select all forms you want to target, and jquery wil ldo the rest
[17:53:48] <erichynds> no need to loop yourself
[17:54:07] <Paganini> I see, thanks :)
[17:55:36] <solidus-river> i'm defining a function in a widget, i want to reference another function from the widgit in the success method of an ajax call called from a function of that widgit, is this.functionname() valid?
[17:56:45] <solidus-river> wait, maybe if in the function prior to the ajax call i define var t = this, then reference that
[17:58:43] <solidus-river> yep gettin somewhere
[18:00:48] <solidus-river> is that data returned from the request automatically parsed as a json object if it is a valid json object?
[18:01:25] <garbagegod> can someone please give me a hand with something
[18:01:35] <solidus-river> whats up garbagegod?
[18:02:07] <garbagegod> http://wilsoncomputer.com/staging/w/s/ if you click on the text by #2 and you see the way that it transistions with the second slide all under the first one until the transition is finished
[18:02:16] <garbagegod> thanks for answering so quick btw :)
[18:02:42] <garbagegod> is there a way i can make it so it just goes right to left smoothly without slide 2 being forced under slide 1 during the transition?
[18:02:51] <solidus-river> garbagegod, i suspect this is a css issue
[18:03:01] <solidus-river> did you clear a float after you made slide1 and then you put in slide 2?
[18:03:09] <solidus-river> if so slide 2 will be under slide 1 untill slide 1 is removed
[18:03:23] <garbagegod> interesting
[18:03:27] <garbagegod> ill play with it a little bit
[18:03:30] <garbagegod> thank you so so much
[18:04:15] <solidus-river> np, extra eyes always help
[18:05:22] <garbagegod> very true :D
[18:11:12] <Iarfen> hi
[18:11:37] <Iarfen> how I can know if a input type='file' has an image selected?? I need to do it with jQuery
[18:12:20] <erichynds> you can't
[18:12:35] <erichynds> well, i guess you could get the value and parse the extension after an image is selected
[18:12:38] <garbagegod> solidus-river: actually my slides are positioned relatively
[18:14:04] <digitalfiz> hey guys im having a weird error i cant find an answer for
[18:14:07] <digitalfiz> Uncaught TypeError: Object function (a){return a.nodeName.toLowerCase()} has no method 'toLowerCase'
[18:14:38] <garbagegod> i tried floating them but the same thing still happens :(
[18:15:23] <aghouseh> floating can touch butts imo
[18:15:32] <garbagegod> hahaha]
[18:15:45] <garbagegod> i bet the solution to this is actually really simple
[18:16:03] <garbagegod> and as soon as i figure out what it is I'm going to be like how did i not realize that
[18:19:37] <garbagegod> if one of you were to attempt to recreate a successful model of my specific application or if you have seen something like it in the past is there specific css positioning required for it?
[18:19:40] <aghouseh> larfen: you could check the file extension, but short of uploading the file adn checking the type
[18:20:04] <garbagegod> i cant go to bed until i figure this out and its like 10 :P
[18:22:48] <aghouseh> garbagegod: you should probably just have a 'sled' of sorts
[18:22:58] <aghouseh> garbagegod: with a containing div that has overflow:hidden
[18:23:17] <aghouseh> and all of the child divs floated next to each other
[18:24:04] <garbagegod> thats a good idea
[18:24:11] <digitalfiz> grr!
[18:24:37] <aghouseh> also, that functionality looks exactly like the 'coda' slider style
[18:24:41] <aghouseh> http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Coda-Slider
[18:26:27] <garbagegod> aghouseh: nice! ill just use that if need be. you're a real lifesaver thanks
[18:26:41] <aghouseh> sure thing. gl!

[18:47:37] <digitalfiz> someone please help
[18:47:52] <coldhead> ?p @ digitalfiz
[18:47:53] <bot-t> digitalfiz, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:47:58] <coldhead> show us what you're doing to trigger that
[18:48:15] <digitalfiz> $('#tabs').tabs();
[18:49:07] <coldhead> and uh would there be some hTML involved?
[18:51:12] <digitalfiz> http://fixee.org/paste/i8m4wo4/
[18:51:44] <erichynds> i bet if i put that html in jsfiddle with $('#tabs').tabs() it'll work perfectly
[18:51:54] <erichynds> ANY TAKERS
[18:51:55] <digitalfiz> maybe
[18:52:15] <digitalfiz> maybe its a bug in the jquery theme maker
[18:53:19] <coldhead> maybe everything is going to be okay forever
[18:53:43] <erichynds> maybe i'm not wearing any underwear
[18:53:56] <coldhead> that's a promising start
[18:53:58] <aot2002__> coldhead, you would think he would take down thickbox website
[18:54:22] <coldhead> aot2002__: i think he forgot the password :(
[18:58:15] <digitalfiz> coldhead, im not using any extra code its just the jquery ui+theme roller and it is only messing with that html code i pasted the rest of the code is out of scope per se
[18:59:24] <coldhead> ajpiano: help a brother with a UI/tabs problem?
[18:59:36] <coldhead> i don't know enough about tabs to help sorry digitalfiz
[18:59:47] <digitalfiz> :/
[18:59:48] <coldhead> also i am having a leg removed without anaesthetic
[18:59:55] <digitalfiz> awesome
[19:00:05] <digitalfiz> working on some man points?
[19:00:36] <coldhead> not the way i'm crying and screaming i'm not
[19:00:44] <erichynds> rofl
[19:00:52] <digitalfiz> if no body knows your screaming it still counts
[19:00:57] <erichynds> digitalfiz: you must have other code going on there
[19:01:21] <digitalfiz> erichynds, yeah its lots of code but the error goes away when i remove the tabs line
[19:01:22] <erichynds> or perhaps a version of jquery and jquery ui that aren't compatible w/ each other
[19:01:35] <digitalfiz> also everything else works but the tabs for to #something instead of switching tabs
[19:02:05] <digitalfiz> i thought that but i included the one that comes with the theme roller package to make sure
[19:02:12] <erichynds> are there multiple elements with that id in ur html?
[19:02:27] <erichynds> what version of both are you using?
[19:03:19] <digitalfiz> jquery-1.5.1.min
[19:03:27] <digitalfiz> jquery-ui-1.8.14.custom.min
[19:03:48] <digitalfiz> i just made the theme roller theme
[19:03:58] <erichynds> themeroller doesn't play a part in that error
[19:04:27] <coldhead> that's the wrong jQuery for that UI version
[19:04:56] <digitalfiz> it cam packaged with  the ui from themeroller...
[19:04:59] <digitalfiz> came*
[19:05:11] <coldhead> heh
[19:05:16] <coldhead> maybe it's fine then
[19:05:20] <coldhead> MAYBE EVERYTHING IS FINE
[19:05:26] <digitalfiz> maybe
[19:05:35] <coldhead> i thought UI was secretly precious about versions
[19:05:40] <coldhead> but i've never used UI
[19:05:45] <coldhead> and it's only my first day with jQuery
[19:05:57] <erichynds> O_O
[19:06:06] <digitalfiz> ive never had issues with it before
[19:06:16] <digitalfiz> i have had issues with themeroller before but not this one
[19:06:18] <radiantstatic> I'm attempting to redo my nav concept with jquery instead of mootools because I just can't get the timing right when the drop down pulls up and the horizontal slide closes. I don't know much about jquery but I was looking for some insight on where to start. queue() perhaps? http://jsfiddle.net/radiantstatic/4MWRp/15/
[19:07:46] <coldhead> digitalfiz: best thing to do would be to get a working demo up at jsfiddle
[19:07:50] <coldhead> then someone can use a debugger on it
[19:07:58] <coldhead> or you might find the problem while setting that up
[19:08:10] <coldhead> otherwise people have to try to solve it in their imaginations
[19:08:16] <coldhead> and when i imagine it, it works

[19:19:38] <digitalfiz> coldhead, it works fine in jsfiddle :/
[19:19:48] <coldhead> so like erichynds said...
[19:19:57] <erichynds> digitalfiz how's that problem?
[19:19:59] <coldhead> SOMETHING ELSE, SOMETHING ELSE
[19:20:06] <erichynds> wat
[19:20:11] <coldhead> just link to jsfiddle from your site
[19:20:15] <coldhead> and send people there
[19:20:21] <erichynds> you have some js that is conflicting with it

[19:20:41] * styol loves periodically catching nuggets of coldhead wisdom
[19:20:59] <coldhead> you should try my audio book
[19:20:59] <erichynds> digitalfiz remove shit from ur scripts until it starts to work

[19:21:09] <digitalfiz> erichynds, im trying to track it down now its just weird that its effecting it like this
[19:21:17] <digitalfiz> yeah thats what im doing
[19:21:33] <styol> link me up, im getting that shit
[19:29:26] <garbagegod> is there anything like coda except more simple and less terrible?
[19:29:52] <garbagegod> my experience with coda is that if you dont use it exactly as it was designed to be used it breaks
[19:30:09] <garbagegod> and i need to be able to customize the links and whatnot without having to hide the default arrows and stuff
[19:30:09] <digitalfiz> omfg
[19:30:19] <digitalfiz> erichynds, coldhead it was greybox
[19:30:37] <coldhead> just as erichynds++ predicted
[19:30:43] <coldhead> good job everyone
[19:30:48] <erichynds> what is greybox
[19:31:00] <digitalfiz> lame version of facebox
[19:31:35] <erichynds> facebox is the worst
[19:31:35] <garbagegod> anyone? quick
[19:31:52] <digitalfiz> i like facebox lol
[19:31:54] <styol> garbagegod: not sure, i only use it for code.. you referring to its rendering or something?
[19:31:59] <erichynds> YOU WOULD
[19:32:22] <digitalfiz> it has never caused any conflicts for me and always worked exactly as it was supposed to
[19:32:43] <DjTommy2> hey guys, I have an issue, I have a page in which i use .load('page.php') into a <div>, i am trying to call a function from the main page (index.php) from the child page, but parent.Function() does not seem to be working
[19:32:47] <garbagegod> styol1: whenever i use dynamicArrows:false, and dynamicTabs:false, it breaks and just says loading
[19:33:11] <garbagegod> im really frustrated its impossible to do this simple task correctly and simply
[19:33:20] <garbagegod> considering its basically what jquery was made for
[19:33:21] <styol> garbagegod: what are referring to?
[19:33:24] <garbagegod> but i digress
[19:33:28] <erichynds> DjTommy2 are you using iframes?
[19:33:31] <garbagegod> styol: coda slider?
[19:33:42] <styol> garbagegod: me talking bout coda editor, sorry bout that
[19:33:56] <garbagegod> fuck
[19:34:25] <DjTommy2> no i am loading the page into a <div> e.g; $('.dcontent').fadeOut('slow', function() { $(this).load("ajax.php?"+param, function() { $(this).fadeIn('slow') }) });
[19:34:58] <garbagegod> this slider is going to kill me
[19:35:55] <garbagegod> isnt there anything else out there like coda slider?

[19:54:52] <tucan> HI, I'm experiencing some inconsistencies with my jquery slider on http://jleesoft.com/cardones/   could someone take a look?
[19:55:24] <tucan> upon several refreshes, the slider breaks
[19:56:18] <eubey> tucan works fine for me, windows 7, chrome 12
[19:56:37] <tucan> eubey: please test in firefox 3
[19:56:53] <tucan> and be sure to refresh a couple of times
[19:57:02] <tucan> to see the inconsistencies
[19:57:47] <eubey> tucan, only have ff4 installed but it works fine there too
[19:58:46] <tucan> eubey: me and a couple testers are noticing an out of place image on the right, let me take a screenshot
[20:00:36] <imsky> who's going to boston?
[20:02:20] <tucan> eubey: http://jleesoft.com/cardones/Untitled2.png  thats whats happening to us on some refreshes
[20:06:31] <graphikz> hey - I'm having some trouble to get the top part of the list to collapse after you open it in IE (http://home.irollbitches.com:3000/#leasing).. works fine in everything else. any ideas?
[20:06:32] <eubey> tucan wish I could help you but i'm relatively new myself. only thing I coudl suggest is try a different slider plugin. Nivoslider is pretty nice. (http://nivo.dev7studios.com/)
[20:07:32] <dualcore> how can you count the number of an element?  http://jsfiddle.net/NqvYr/
[20:09:15] <imsky> dualcore: http://jsfiddle.net/NqvYr/1/
[20:10:00] <dualcore> imsky: perfect thank you
[20:10:05] <imsky> np bud
[20:33:03] <dualcore> can you interrupt an animation ?
[20:33:21] <djQuery> dualcore: you can see ?.stop
[20:33:22] <bot-t> dualcore, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[20:33:24] <dualcore> like have it stop before it is finished and trigger another function
[20:33:33] <dualcore> thank you djQuery
[20:34:36] <djQuery> dualcore: very usefull in hover animations so that if you move in and out quickly it doesnt keep flasign for a few cycles when ur done
[20:35:57] <dualcore> yes this is exactly what i wanted to do thank you djQuery

[21:07:26] <DjTommy2> im trying to call a function in a parent window from a child <div> content that i loaded via ajax/jquery any ideas? parent.functio() is not working
[21:09:21] <Whirl3d> Hey guys, what kinds of things could make it so that I couldn't click on an anchor (or any element) inside of a div and how do I check for something like that?
[21:09:50] <seancurtis> Whirl3d: can't click on it?
[21:09:55] <seancurtis> as in nothing happens when you do
[21:09:57] <Whirl3d> I checked for bound click handlers on the parent items, none existed.
[21:09:59] <seancurtis> or you don't get the pointer cursor?
[21:09:59] <Whirl3d> right
[21:10:19] <Whirl3d> Can't click. Like form fields will focus with the tab, but not clicked on
[21:10:24] <seancurtis> return false or preventDefault would stop default link behaviour
[21:10:35] <seancurtis> Whirl3d: that sounds like something hidden is overlaying it
[21:10:47] <Whirl3d> How do I figure that out, I wonder?
[21:10:53] <seancurtis> inspect via firebug
[21:11:10] <seancurtis> actually disable styles first
[21:11:15] <seancurtis> that'll tell you if it's JS or CSS
[21:11:18] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I have been trying that with Chrome Developer Tools and don't really see anything.
[21:11:22] <seancurtis> or disable JS first
[21:11:23] <seancurtis> either or
[21:11:26] <Whirl3d> seancurtis, great idea
[21:11:35] <Whirl3d> thanks for your help. Will do that right away
[21:11:38] <seancurtis> if it's CSS and your project is small
[21:11:47] <seancurtis> just comment out blocks of CSS until you find the offending one
[21:11:53] <seancurtis> if the Chrome inspector isn't helping
[21:13:59] <Whirl3d> here is the rough, rough rough draft, but it shows the issue. Not that I expect you to look, but it demonstrates the point (click on Contact, for example). I'll start disabling css--thx for your help
[21:14:06] <Whirl3d> http://www.bharveylawfirm.com/main2.html
[21:15:52] <esparkman> Whirl3d: what's the issue
[21:16:09] <radiantstatic> whats the best way to have a horizontal accordion?
[21:16:38] <Whirl3d> Can't get the form fields to focus on click. Can't get the pdfs to download in "cases" can't get the field in the maps page to focus....it's like something is stealing the click event
[21:16:58] <Whirl3d> Nothing in the page is clickable. I'm sure it's something silly
[21:17:19] <seancurtis> Whirl3d: works for me
[21:17:27] <Whirl3d> Really?
[21:17:28] <seancurtis> oh
[21:17:30] <seancurtis> the menu works
[21:17:33] <seancurtis> but the page doesn't
[21:17:41] <Whirl3d> right. there's the rub
[21:18:03] <Whirl3d> can't even click the scrollbar
[21:18:16] <Whirl3d> Must be something overlaying it, but I am not sure what that could be
[21:20:46] <seancurtis> Whirl3d: don't use z-index :)
[21:20:48] <seancurtis> it's really bad
[21:21:05] <seancurtis> the problem is z-index: -100 on .mainContent .contentPanel
[21:21:07] <Whirl3d> Yeah. I figured as much. How else do I handle it
[21:21:22] <seancurtis> well you shouldn't need to use it at all
[21:21:43] <seancurtis> build the page block-by-block - think of where the layers would be and what sits on what
[21:21:45] <Whirl3d> I have five images that I need to have the "next" image each time load on top of the other
[21:22:35] <Whirl3d> So, rather than fading out one image and fading in the replacement, it fades in an image on top of the old one and then hides the old one
[21:22:57] <Whirl3d> And this cycles for each page click.
[21:23:31] <seancurtis> yeah I saw
[21:23:52] <radiantstatic> Does anyone know if there is a simple way to have a horizontal accordion?
[21:24:10] <seancurtis> radiantstatic: maybe look for some plugins - plenty of accordion ones aroudnd
[21:25:31] <esparkman> seancurtis: http://www.slidedeck.com/
[21:25:39] <Whirl3d> seancurtis, the zindex on the main content was the problem for the clicks. I removed it and now the bg images are gone. LOL I hate CSS, btw. Even if I were better at it (which I admittedly am not), I'd still hate it.
[21:27:42] <Whirl3d> Thanks for your help also. And feel free to make any suggestions, comments, etc. This was a last minute project that I picked up yesterday, so I am kind of rushing through it.
[21:28:05] <seancurtis> Whirl3d: what browsers are you supporting?
[21:28:37] <Whirl3d> As many as possible, hopefully. Right now just Chrome and Firefox...but I hope to make them all work one day
[21:39:44] <dorigentoo> hi
[21:40:49] <Whirl3d> hi there
[21:41:10] <dorigentoo> I'd like to write a condition to insure the client is able to load a complex design via javascript smoothly, otherwise I'd display a simple list. Which criteria would you use for this test ?
[21:41:26] <Whirl3d> huh?
[21:41:49] <Whirl3d> "complex design"?
[21:42:48] <dorigentoo> given a list of objects received as json data, I'd be able to display them as a simple list, or in something more beautiful (like 3d circle). The last one will require more cpu usage
[21:42:58] <dorigentoo> sorry I don't express myself very well :/
[21:43:25] <Whirl3d> You're doing fine....So you want to know how to ensure that it goes smoothly?
[21:43:35] <dorigentoo> yes
[21:43:36] <Whirl3d> Maybe by preloading the elements?
[21:44:38] <dorigentoo> hmm I guess I don't look in the good direction. There are obviously some clients who won't be able to see the design correctly, but it's a css issue and not js, sorry
[21:44:52] <fourcolors> hi, I'm having a really hard time inserting a div after an id. I'm trying to insert a div after an id called "row_content" http://pastie.org/2252174
[21:44:59] <fourcolors> not sure why it's not working
[21:45:17] <fourcolors> shouldn't this code insert my div right after the "row_content" div?
[21:45:32] <Whirl3d> you need the "<" in front of your text area
[21:45:58] <Whirl3d> $("<textare[name='listing[....
[21:46:03] <fourcolors> oh!
[21:46:03] <Cork> fourcolors: you need to escape your selector
[21:46:24] <Cork> 	
[21:46:24] <Cork> $("textarea[name='listing[job_description]']")
[21:46:26] <Cork> opps
[21:46:35] <Cork> $("textarea[name='listing\[job_description\]']") should work
[21:46:45] <Whirl3d> really?
[21:46:49] <Cork> ya
[21:46:53] <snover> you do not need to escape stuff inside quotes
[21:47:10] <Whirl3d> wow, I thought you always had to use $("<textarea ...
[21:47:13] <Cork> in a css selector you do
[21:47:15] <snover> no
[21:47:17] <snover> you don’t
[21:47:23] <Cork> i've always had to at least
[21:47:38] <Cork> (did it last a few mins ago)
[21:48:02] <snover> http://jsfiddle.net/sE3nF/
[21:48:08] <Whirl3d> <--never escaped a selector personally...course that's not saying much.
[21:48:40] <fourcolors> ok im really confused now
[21:48:45] <fourcolors> escaping didn't work
[21:48:47] <Cork> snover: wierd
[21:49:01] <KingDosser> Hey, I am having trouble calling a plugin on an element that is getting loaded by an ajax call.
[21:49:10] <KingDosser> http://pastie.org/private/qrcyxn73bvp7lu8ea0t5iq Here is my code... that textarea resize isnt working.
[21:49:16] <snover> not weird :)
[21:49:18] <Whirl3d> did you try enclosing actual html in the selector by adding the <> around the tags
[21:49:24] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/rkSPE/
[21:49:39] * gnarf backs up snover
[21:49:44] <fourcolors> Whirl3d: ya, that didn't help
[21:49:45] <gnarf> with the pure CSS test
[21:49:46] <gnarf> :)
[21:49:55] <snover> you’re always behind me gnarf
[21:50:06] <Cork> snover: what i meant is it's never worked for me
[21:50:07] <gnarf> but not when it counts?
[21:50:08] * coldhead faps
[21:50:16] <fourcolors> this command works just fine         $("textarea[name='listing[job_description]']").addClass("error_input");
[21:50:22] <Cork> snover: i've written it like that, and then had to add the escapes to make it work
[21:50:35] <fourcolors> which I use just before this other one im trying to do
[21:50:50] <KingDosser> Hey coldhead
[21:50:59] <snover> Cork: An old Sizzle had some bug, perhaps
[21:51:04] <fourcolors> i just need to navigate the html ... and insert a div
[21:51:19] <Cork> snover: ah, might be
[21:51:33] * Cork tests on is current project again :)
[21:51:42] <Cork> it started way back in 1.2 so... :D
[21:52:20] <fourcolors> hum.. so everything looks good to you guys with $("textarea[name='listing[job_description]']").parent().after("<div class='error_text'>can't be blank</div>");
[21:52:43] <KingDosser> Hey, I am having trouble calling a plugin on an element that is getting loaded by an ajax call. http://pastie.org/private/qrcyxn73bvp7lu8ea0t5iq Here is my code... that textarea resize isnt working.
[21:53:20] <Cork> snover: heh and so it does :)
[21:53:30] <snover> so what whats?
[21:53:38] <Cork> snover: that cleans up the code nicly ^^
[21:54:27] <coldhead> hey Dosser
[21:54:37] <Cork> fourcolors: just a side note, you should try moving over to a more modern way of handling floats
[21:55:00] <Cork> (without using clear)
[21:55:01] <snover> yeah, x87 is so old school
[21:55:17] <fourcolors> Cork: how are floats handled now?
[21:55:34] <Cork> fourcolors: wrap them in a container with overflow: hidden;
[21:55:52] <KingDosser> How's it going coldhead ?
[21:56:01] <snover> cork wattttt
[21:56:04] <fourcolors> Cork: ok. Thanks for the tip
[21:56:08] <Cork> np
[21:56:39] <coldhead> pretty tensely, KD
[21:58:29] <Cork> fourcolors: back to your original problem http://jsfiddle.net/8TeZH/1/
[21:58:31] <Cork> wfm
[21:59:18] <coldhead> something about maps?
[21:59:46] <fourcolors> Cork: hum.. I must have some js somewhere messing stuff up
[21:59:50] <fourcolors> ill have to try and find it
[22:00:19] <KingDosser> coldhead: :) Got a sec to give me a hand ?
[22:01:21] <coldhead> potentially!
[22:01:30] <coldhead> it would be a left hand and it has some blood on it
[22:02:51] <coldhead> MECHANICAL!
[22:02:53] <coldhead> ORGANIC!
[22:05:42] <KingDosser> @coldhead: I am having trouble calling a plugin on an element that is getting loaded by an ajax call. http://pastie.org/private/qrcyxn73bvp7lu8ea0t5iq Here is my code... that textarea resize isnt working.
[22:05:59] <KingDosser> That isn't very well worded.
[22:06:42] <coldhead> i get the general idea KD
[22:07:24] <KingDosser> :)
[22:07:26] <coldhead> you don't have the ajax call here
[22:07:29] <coldhead> i have no context
[22:07:44] <KingDosser> Okay sec
[22:08:44] <KingDosser> Refresh bud :p
[22:09:31] <bobbobbins> http://jsfiddle.net/4tc3c/1/ can someone take a look at this...i have two vars that are getting assigned an undefined as the first spot in their array, but they shouldn't...they're called intervals and years
[22:12:08] <Cork> bobbobbins: aare you doing something like resetting them in spdiData?
[22:12:38] <bobbobbins> nah, i checked the var before it hits that and the undefined is already there
[22:12:46] <Cork> hmm
[22:13:16] <Cork> bobbobbins: where do you find its undefined?
[22:14:11] <coldhead> that doesn't look too bad, KingDosser
[22:14:21] <bobbobbins> Cork: http://207.228.238.25/spdi/Special_Ed_Starting_dev_server_David.html
[22:14:23] <KingDosser>  coldhead: The code?
[22:14:25] <coldhead> the only obvious problem i can see is that $(this) might not mean what you want it to mean
[22:14:34] <coldhead> in your autoResize() call
[22:14:37] <bobbobbins> theres a working demo, you can see that the first spot in the array is undefined
[22:14:47] <bobbobbins> if you view the console
[22:15:13] <KingDosser> coldhead: The thing is, when I execute it in firebug it fully works.
[22:15:31] <Cork> bobbobbins: you've just added undefined to the first value in the array :)
[22:15:42] <bobbobbins> i did?
[22:16:00] <bobbobbins> how did i do that?
[22:16:04] <coldhead> http://pastie.org/private/16xeprsfmszvzzvdzonvua
[22:16:22] <coldhead> KingDosser: hmm, what about if you wrap the call to autoResize in a setTimeout
[22:16:34] <coldhead> to give the AJAX a couple of milliseconds to complete
[22:16:58] <KingDosser> coldhead: what if the user has a REALLY slow connection though?
[22:17:27] <snover> if only there was some sort of callback
[22:17:38] <snover> but I guess javascript doesn’t have functions
[22:17:45] <Cork> bobbobbins: $('div#widget1').attr('interval') == undefined
[22:18:06] <Cork> first time to go into the if statements thats what you add to your array
[22:18:26] <coldhead> maybe it isn't the timing, KingDosser
[22:18:32] <coldhead> try the pastebin i linked
[22:18:41] <coldhead> without the $(this)
[22:19:02] <bobbobbins> Cork: i don't see that in my code anywhere
[22:19:06] <Cork> bobbobbins: lol sorry
[22:19:19] <KingDosser> $question_input ?? lol
[22:19:57] <Cork> bobbobbins: when you add to intervals you use metrics.length
[22:20:05] <bobbobbins> ohh
[22:20:08] <Cork> bobbobbins: and when that happens your at length 1
[22:20:15] <Cork> so first one will be undefined
[22:20:35] <bobbobbins> so i need to do metrics.length-1
[22:20:43] <Cork> yes
[22:20:47] <bobbobbins> Cork, thanks!
[22:20:52] <Cork> np
[22:21:39] <KingDosser> Not working coldhead
[22:22:29] <ruby_on_tails> how to create step animation ?
[22:23:10] <ruby_on_tails> $(".navigation-1").each(function(){	$(this).fadeIn('slow').delay(4000);  }); something like this
[22:23:13] <ruby_on_tails> it doesnt work obviously
[22:23:38] <ruby_on_tails> the first class found should fade in first, then after 4000t the second one should fade in, then the 3rd one, with intervals in between
[22:26:20] <ruby_on_tails> i dont want to create nested calls
[22:26:21] <coldhead> KingDosser: then either try a setTimeout or add console.log() messages through your code to see what is firing when and with what value
[22:26:25] <ruby_on_tails> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6151874/jquery-step-by-step-animation like this one
[22:26:37] <coldhead> so like console.log('Got to this next part with this', this)
[22:26:56] <coldhead> falcom punnnnch
[22:27:15] <ruby_on_tails> wonder palmmmm
[22:28:29] <ruby_on_tails> coldhead: how can i pause execution in a .each() loop ?
[22:28:47] <ruby_on_tails> $(".navigation-1").each(function(){ $(this).fadeIn('slow');  setTimeout("pause();", 5000); }); this doesnt work either
[22:29:00] <gurumelo> ?.tooltip
[22:29:02] <bot-t> gurumelo, Tooltip | jQuery Plugins - Display a customized tooltip instead of the default one for every selected element. The tooltip behaviour mimics the default one, but lets you style the tooltip and specify the delay before display... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/tooltip
[22:29:50] <styol> ruby_on_tails: if it did work i think all those elements would still do the exact same thing
[22:30:02] <ajpiano> ruby_on_tails, 1 sec, ill make something for ya
[22:30:06] <ruby_on_tails> styol: yes i want all of them to fade in but one after the other
[22:30:18] <ruby_on_tails> and i dont want to manually put nested callbacks n number of times
[22:30:48] <KingDosser> coldhead: Where would I add the setTimeout?
[22:31:00] <coldhead> around the bit that isn't working
[22:31:11] <coldhead> its a really crappy fix, KingDosser
[22:31:22] <KingDosser> thats what i was thinking
[22:31:22] <coldhead> it's desparate measures
[22:31:28] <coldhead> desperate*
[22:31:41] <coldhead> if you use weird random plugins that's what happens sometimes
[22:31:41] <KingDosser> console.log('Got to this next part with this', this) - This throws serrors
[22:31:54] <coldhead> my god
[22:32:00] <coldhead> it's not very controversial
[22:32:12] <coldhead> you might have bigger problems :(
[22:34:42] <ajpiano> ruby_on_tails http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/8xr6N/
[22:34:45] <KingDosser> coldhead like?
[22:34:56] <coldhead> like not having a web browser?
[22:35:06] <coldhead> because console.log() should run fine
[22:35:08] <ajpiano> ruby_on_tails: the key is not to loop at all, but rather to have each calback fire the fade on the next element in the set
[22:35:11] <coldhead> and this should always be something
[22:35:22] <coldhead> ?eval console.log('not a problem', this)
[22:35:23] <bot-t> coldhead: "not a problem" <global object>
[22:35:32] <coldhead> see, even without a browser, no problemo
[22:39:02] <ruby_on_tails> ajpiano: hmm
[22:39:30] <ruby_on_tails> ajpiano: i understand the loop but not the way you call it and the braces around
[22:39:47] <ajpiano> ruby_on_tails it's from here http://paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/
[22:40:14] <ajpiano> ruby_on_tails there is no loop
[22:40:26] <ajpiano> it creates a function and passes a jquery object into it
[22:41:01] <ruby_on_tails> ajpiano: recursion i meant
[22:41:06] <ajpiano> the function grabs the first element in the set, fades it in, and then in the callback, it resets the collection to be everything after that element, and if there is anything in the new collection, it passes that collection to the named function
[22:41:14] <ajpiano> at which point it ^^^ ... [repeat]
[22:42:43] <ruby_on_tails> ajpiano: thats fine
[22:42:55] <ruby_on_tails> but the end - ($("div")) whats that for ?
[22:43:13] <KingDosser> coldhead: I get missing : after property id if I put inside the functio.
[22:43:17] <KingDosser> function. *
[22:44:08] <ajpiano> ruby_on_tails that's passing the collection into the function
[22:44:17] <ajpiano> ruby_on_tails just as you can create a function
[22:44:21] <ruby_on_tails> thats a weird sntax
[22:44:21] <ajpiano> function foo() {}
[22:44:26] <ajpiano> and then exectute it
[22:44:27] <ajpiano> foo()
[22:44:31] <ajpiano> you can also create a function and execute it
[22:44:35] <ruby_on_tails> then why didnt they do it this way ?
[22:44:39] <ajpiano> (function foo())();
[22:44:41] <ruby_on_tails> foo();
[22:44:45] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[22:44:55] <ruby_on_tails> aah
[22:44:55] <ruby_on_tails> ok
[22:44:56] <ruby_on_tails> got it
[22:45:18] <ajpiano> (function foo() {})() that is.
[22:45:19] <ajpiano> but yea
[22:45:30] <ajpiano> cause it's more baller this way,
[22:45:47] <Cork> and in some cases you just want to create a scope
[22:45:57] <Cork> (then you skip the function name)
[22:46:00] <ruby_on_tails> ajpiano:       (elem = elem.slice(1)).length && fade(elem); and what syntax is this ?
[22:46:07] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: hmm
[22:46:18] <ajpiano> ruby_on_tails, you can use a && in javascript as an if test
[22:46:26] <ruby_on_tails> umm
[22:46:27] <ruby_on_tails> okk
[22:46:28] <snover> CONDITIONAL
[22:46:29] <snover> ajpiano
[22:46:30] <ajpiano> if (foo) { bar(); }
[22:46:30] <snover> geez
[22:46:35] <snover> “if test”
[22:46:38] <snover> you noob
[22:46:52] <ajpiano> ahahahahaha
[22:47:01] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: var result = (function() { var temp_testing; ... return temp_testing })();
[22:47:05] <snover> oshiiii
[22:47:09] <ruby_on_tails> if(foo()) {bar(); }  === foo() && bar(); ?
[22:47:10] <ajpiano> :D
[22:47:21] <ajpiano> ruby_on_tails yup
[22:47:22] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: hmm
[22:47:30] <ruby_on_tails> ok
[22:47:32] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: that way if you need to do lots of variables and things it won't polute the rest of the function
[22:47:43] <ruby_on_tails> got it
[22:48:15] <gnarf> && returns left side if falsy, right side if truthy, right side is not evaluated if left side is falsy
[22:48:40] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: use it qute a lot when i extend $.browser.support
[22:48:53] <gnarf> || returns right side if left is falsy, left side if it is truthy - right side not evaluated when left is falsy
[22:51:48] <ruby_on_tails> got it
[22:51:50] <ruby_on_tails> works now
[22:51:52] <ruby_on_tails> cool
[22:51:56] <ruby_on_tails> too many new syntaxes to learn
[22:52:40] <gnarf> er truthy at the last part of the || description
[22:52:49] <gnarf> whatevs
[22:53:07] <gnarf> truthiness!
[22:59:48] <coldhead> KingDosser: paste the borked version?
[23:07:13] <dilvie> are there any known issues with trying to get the color property with .css?
[23:26:08] <denysonique_> dilvie: no
[23:26:20] <denysonique_> I don't think so
[23:26:27] <KingDosser> coldhead: http://pastie.org/private/wwbqgksigkvegu69mqguq
[23:28:04] <ruby_on_tails> $(".movedown").animate({margin-top: '-10px'}); whats wrong with this ? i get a "missing : after property id"
[23:31:16] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: 'margin-top'
[23:31:27] <Cork> you can't have spae or dash in key names
[23:31:27] <ruby_on_tails> whats wrong with that ?
[23:31:36] <Cork> you need to make it a string
[23:31:36] <ruby_on_tails> thats a valid css attribute ?
[23:31:47] <Cork> but not valid js keys
[23:31:54] <ruby_on_tails> umm
[23:31:56] <ruby_on_tails> then what to do ?
[23:31:58] <Cork> .animate({'margin-top': '-10px'})
[23:31:58] <ruby_on_tails> margintop ?
[23:32:05] <ruby_on_tails> ok
[23:32:06] <Cork> marginTop works too
[23:32:12] <Cork> either use the js key
[23:32:17] <Cork> or make them strings
[23:34:06] <silv3r_m00n> on a form , I want to disable submission on pressing Enter key in any input tag , what is the best way to do this ?
[23:35:22] <Cork> $(<your form> input).bind('keypress', function(event) { event.stopPropagation(); });
[23:36:10] <silv3r_m00n> hmm
[23:37:25] <silv3r_m00n> doesn't work , my code is $('#idle_dialog form input').bind('keypress', function(event) { event.stopPropagation(); });
[23:37:42] <Cork> try keyup then
[23:37:58] <Cork> i'm not sure what even the form triggers on
[23:37:59] <coldhead> KingDosser: you can't just drop a console.log anywhere
[23:38:01] <Cork> *event
[23:38:03] <coldhead> it's a statemnet
[23:38:20] <coldhead> you can probably fake it there with ignorethis: console.log(etc),
[23:38:33] <coldhead> and that will give that key the value returned by .log()
[23:38:48] <silv3r_m00n> none of keyup and keydown , keypress work
[23:42:25] <KingDosser> Sorry coldhead.. what do I do?
[23:42:47] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: just checked again, keypress should work
[23:43:11] <silv3r_m00n> I had to do this if(event.which == 13) { return false; }
[23:44:40] <coldhead> KingDosser: http://pastie.org/private/swb61zgjwa3rdnifuf4q
[23:46:25] <KingDosser> Cheers coldhead: Now, what should I be telling you from this?
[23:47:51] * seutje hugs coldhead
[23:49:24] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: hmm, looks like submit and keypress isn't related in the event queue
[23:49:34] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: look like i remembered wrong
[23:52:20] <silv3r_m00n> ok
[23:53:34] <KingDosser> coldhead: I have tested it at all points throughout the function.
[23:58:22] <silv3r_m00n> I need all submittable inputs of a form , is this correct >> $form.find('input[type=text] , textarea , select , input[type=checkbox]:checked , input[type=radio]:checked')   ?
[23:58:33] <silv3r_m00n> I need it since I would be submitting via ajax
