[00:00:01] <kevireillyy> davidmahoney: var myarray = [{ foo: 'bar' }, { beep: 'boop' }]; var temp = ["1", "0"]; var newarray = []; for (var i in temp) { newarray.push(myarray[temp[i]]); } myarray = newarray; console.log(myarray);
[00:00:04] <innociv> ... oh it's -1-1?
[00:00:16] <raj> what's that mean?
[00:00:30] <innociv> so 40 should be 0.11111?
[00:00:46] <sacho> no.
[00:01:03] <sacho> please read the description of the parameter. This is kind of off-topic.
[00:02:38] <raj> so anyone with knowledge of 'paste' event?
[00:02:53] <Cork> raj: whats the problem?
[00:02:55] <davidmahoney> why are you using a associative array I could get your code to work maybe modify the jsfiddle
[00:03:05] <raj> I'm seeing weird solutions like http://stackoverflow.com/a/13964699/997624
[00:03:18] <davidmahoney> http://jsfiddle.net/ytBqG/5/
[00:03:27] <sacho> raj, what's weird about that?
[00:03:28] <raj> http://stackoverflow.com/a/6035265/997624
[00:03:32] <davidmahoney> hey Cork
[00:03:34] <raj> oops
[00:03:40] <raj> oh, yes, that one
[00:03:55] <raj> http://stackoverflow.com/a/2242485/997624
[00:03:58] <raj> and that
[00:04:13] <davidmahoney> http://jsfiddle.net/ytBqG/6/ could you help me out how would I update myarray with the new order
[00:04:20] <Cork> raj: the clipboard data isn't provided crossbrowser yet
[00:04:28] <raj> the second one there promises to give me the data before pasting I think
[00:04:32] <Cork> raj: so hacks are used to try to compensate
[00:04:39] <raj> isn't jquery that hack?
[00:04:45] <Cork> no
[00:04:53] <Cork> paste is just an event
[00:04:55] <raj> http://stackoverflow.com/a/6035265/997624 is reliable?
[00:05:01] <Cork> jquery isn't doing anything special for paste
[00:05:19] <Cork> it's not supported cross browser
[00:05:22] <TheEternalAbyss> trying to find the right channel here.. is there a specific channel for macs and issues/troubleshooting for them?
[00:05:36] <raj> it gives an IE solution and an "other browsers" solution though
[00:05:37] <Cork> raj: see the last comment
[00:05:50] <Cork> "It looks like Firefox doesn't allow clipboard operations... – maerics May 17 '11 at 18:55"
[00:05:55] <raj> oh, no ff
[00:05:56] <raj> gotcha
[00:06:14] <Cork> it is supported in really new versions of firefox if i remember correctly
[00:06:37] <raj> then I'll use it
[00:06:41] <Cork> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=407983
[00:07:00] <raj> users just won't get a nice feature till they update their ff
[00:07:04] <Cork> it's in firefox 22 (12 weeks in the future)
[00:07:08] <raj> not a mandatory feature though
[00:08:11] <raj> hmm, or maybe I'll do the delay till jquery gets this patch in
[00:08:20] <Cork> what?
[00:08:26] <Cork> why would jquery have a patch?
[00:08:42] <Cork> this is a browser event; it has little to nothing to do with jquery
[00:09:27] <raj> but just the way jquery gets info about an event, such as the value, won't this be a useful feature?
[00:09:44] <raj> ev.keyCode on keypress, for example
[00:09:49] <Cork> the info is in the original event object
[00:09:54] <Cork> nothing special in jquery for it
[00:10:31] <raj> the value of the item in the clipboard
[00:10:52] <davidmahoney> hey Cork when you get a sec if you could help that would be awesoem
[00:11:10] <Cork> and that is native browser standard objects
[00:12:05] <raj> so jquery doesn't access browser objects?
[00:12:33] <Cork> jquery is mostly just helper to make dom selection and manipulation simpler
[00:12:35] <tw2113> davidmahoney, hasn't cork's help done anything yet?
[00:12:40] <raj> what about a fileupload?
[00:12:46] <Cork> that's about it
[00:12:55] <Cork> well that's a plugin
[00:13:05] <davidmahoney> tw2113 Cork has helped alot
[00:13:06] <Cork> i talk about core features
[00:13:06] <kevireillyy> davidmahoney: http://jsfiddle.net/ytBqG/7/
[00:13:14] <raj> hmm
[00:14:58] <davidmahoney> kevireillyy: what is the 10 for?
[00:15:30] <Cork> davidmahoney: 10 base
[00:15:41] <Cork> i's to get a decimal value
[00:15:42] <kevireillyy> radix or something
[00:15:48] <Cork> yes
[00:16:06] <davidmahoney> awesome kevireilly thank you
[00:16:57] <davidmahoney> keviReillyy: Do you know why the box looks all weird when it get moved around
[00:17:44] <tw2113> nargles
[00:19:44] <kevireillyy> davidmahoney: no problem. min-height 12em maybe?
[00:20:23] <kevireillyy> for fun, define a specific height and/or min-height
[00:23:21] <raj> Cork, how can I modify an existing event?
[00:23:33] <Cork> modify?
[00:23:51] <Cork> you mean change the code in the event callback?
[00:24:02] <raj> actually, I'm not even sure how to do anything like that
[00:24:19] <raj> up till now, I make scripts into plugins by doing (function($) {})
[00:24:47] <raj> up till now, I make scripts into plugins by doing (function($) {$.fn.pastecontent = function(options) {})})
[00:25:06] <Cork> i'm still not sure what the question is
[00:25:12] <raj> oh sorry
[00:26:13] <raj> how can I incorporate http://stackoverflow.com/a/6035265/997624 as a plugin that provides `pastedText` in the data object carried by the event
[00:26:32] <raj> ...the event being the `paste` event
[00:26:51] <davidmahoney> that worked thanks so much guys
[00:27:01] <Cork> well you could create a fake event, and trigger it from your plugin
[00:27:20] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:27:23] <Cork> or you could use jquery spacial event handling to premodify it before the callback
[00:27:53] <Cork> *special
[00:29:18] <raj> I like the latter
[00:29:32] <raj> globals?
[00:30:05] <raj> oh, no, that's ajax
[00:30:23] <raj> ok, better question
[00:30:46] <raj> how would you use the SO code?
[00:30:53] <raj> if you needed the paste content
[00:31:02] <raj> or clipboard content I should say
[00:31:43] <Cork> raj: ed #jquery
[00:31:43] <Cork> <raj> oh, no, that's ajax
[00:31:50] <Cork> bah
[00:31:53] <Cork> WRONG...
[00:31:57] <Cork> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/blob/master/src/event.js#L111
[00:32:27] <raj> not sure what you mean?
[00:32:44] <Cork> raj: that is how you define special event handlers
[00:32:52] <Cork> use that to define paste as special
[00:33:22] <Cork> and then use document.addEventListener to get the original event hand manage it before triggering jquery's event handlers
[00:33:50] <raj> ok, this is way over my head
[00:33:56] <raj> i'm using a timeout
[00:33:59] <Cork> another example you can check in the jquery library is focusout and focusin events handling
[00:46:24] <raj> Cork, if in the paste eventhandler I create a change listener to a text input, does it have enough time to set and start listening before the paste?
[00:46:45] <Cork> create a change listener?!?
[00:47:13] <Cork> no, you should never create a listener in an event
[00:47:31] <Cork> at least not for the same element
[00:49:12] <raj> and then turn it off in the eventhandler of the change event
[00:49:18] <raj> or maybe .one()
[00:49:22] <raj> why's it baD?
[00:51:29] <gavimobile> hi folks, im trying to sync this page with both elements. is this possible? http://motekpc.com/test/new1/index3.php#
[00:51:48] <gavimobile> when I say page I mean pager (pagination)
[00:52:08] <raj> gavimobile, what elements?
[00:52:18] <gavimobile> raj: the two carousels
[00:52:30] <gavimobile> one of them fade and one of them slide
[00:52:50] <raj> I only see 1
[00:52:57] <gavimobile> the left and right arrows work for both of them, however the paginations on the button only works for one of them
[00:53:01] <gavimobile> I want it to work for both of them
[00:53:19] <raj> oh, I see
[00:54:29] <gavimobile> is this something the channel can help me with, or is this a core issue which must be taken up with the author of the carousel?
[00:55:29] <raj> gavimobile, it looks like only 1.jpg and 2.jpg are linked by those
[00:56:18] <gavimobile> no, only the pink section is working with the pagination
[00:56:36] <gavimobile> I want the black section to work also with the pagination
[00:56:47] <raj> ah, i see
[00:57:31] <gavimobile> raj: note how they both work with the next and previous arrow, but only one of them work with the pagination buttons on the bottom center
[00:57:43] <raj> gavimobile, got a link to the docs for carousel?
[00:57:53] <gavimobile> Sure
[00:58:17] <gavimobile> http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/demo/pager.php
[00:58:31] <gavimobile> raj: this is what I did http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/demo/pager.php#adv-custom
[00:59:08] <gavimobile> no, I did something similar, let me find it
[00:59:11] <gavimobile> but this is the plugin
[00:59:33] <raj> class="cycle-slideshow" maybe?
[01:00:30] <gavimobile> raj: that's the default class it uses, but I don't know how to add custom jquery to the code like I did on the top in the script section
[01:00:54] <Kasimir> gavimobile: why have you separated the two sliders?
[01:00:58] <raj> callback
[01:01:20] <gavimobile> Kasimir: cause I want them to have separate effects
[01:01:28] <raj> http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/api/#Events
[01:01:39] <raj> http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/api/#events
[01:02:10] <raj> if that's what you mean
[01:02:53] <gavimobile> raj: check out these first two paragraphs http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/api/#auto-init   but for paging I don't know how to do it like in the example in the second paragraph using the script tags
[01:03:25] <raj> what do you mean?
[01:03:28] <raj> you just add the class
[01:03:28] <Kasimir> gavimobile: you havent defined the pager on the image slider
[01:03:32] <gavimobile> raj: I believe the link you sent me is what I need, I just don't know the jquery code to apply it to what I have
[01:03:41] <gavimobile> rather than using the html code
[01:03:46] <Kasimir> gavimobile: as its a custom pager
[01:04:05] <palominoz> Hello. I currently need to track changes to js models on specific attributes. is there any pattern that i can take advantage from?
[01:04:15] <gavimobile> so how do I do a custom pager via <script type="text/javascript">xxx</script>
[01:04:27] <darkmutt> can i do something like $(".horizontal .vertical").animate or do i have to go $(".horizontal") $(".vertical")
[01:04:28] <tw2113> Cork, it's time to do something drastic
[01:04:37] <gavimobile> I think I can apply it to what I have right now between lines 10 and 15
[01:04:42] <gavimobile> http://pastebin.com/yPjRbUDK
[01:04:46] <seutje> palominoz: u mean event handling on arbitrary objects? or do u mean DOM mutation events?
[01:04:51] <gavimobile> but I don't know how
[01:04:56] <Kasimir> gavimobile: No, just add the datat-cycle-pager="#custom-pager" part to the image slider and see if it does the trick
[01:05:13] <gavimobile> Kasimir: I did that, but then it makes 8 paginations
[01:05:30] <gavimobile> it will add a whole set of 4 which is inaccurate
[01:05:45] <gavimobile> id rather do this via jquery script
[01:05:52] <gavimobile> it'll prob be cleaner
[01:06:06] <Kasimir> gavimobile: hmm, seems like its not meant to be used like that then
[01:06:09] <palominoz> seutje: i have business-logic models that are in a fixed state, and I would like to track wether it has been changed from the original state
[01:06:46] <gavimobile> Kasimir: well I was able to sync both carousels together via jquery.. nothing like that was mentioned for this plugin in the docs, but I was able to suceed
[01:06:52] <palominoz> seutje: ex: user 'admin' changes its name to 'administrator' => admin.modified() => true
[01:07:05] <gavimobile> but now the jquery is becoming a bit more complex to edit the few lines that I did which made it work
[01:07:41] <Kasimir> gavimobile: There is a slider called roaylslider that could do the work for you, but thats a pay to use licensing
[01:07:58] <gavimobile> I did this $('#slideshow, #slideshow-1').cycle({prev: '.prev-1', next: '.next-1' }); which allows me to change the effect on both carousels when clicking the next and previous
[01:08:28] <gavimobile> Kasimir: there's a million of different sliders online and I've tried many of them
[01:08:44] <gavimobile> this one is very light weight and I was hoping I can get it working
[01:08:48] <palominoz> Hello. I currently need to track changes to js models on specific attributes. is there any pattern that i can take advantage from?
[01:09:07] <gavimobile> im so close, this is the only thing left for me to complete this carousel
[01:09:25] <Kasimir> gavimobile: There is millions out there but royalslider is the only one I have come across which works out of the box and is reliable
[01:09:51] <seutje> palominoz: what are you creating the models with?
[01:09:55] <Kasimir> gavimobile: you would probably need to tweak how the pagination works on the slider
[01:10:21] <gavimobile> Kasimir: :-(
[01:10:53] <gavimobile> im looking at the royalslider's website. I see the demos, but which one do you think is closets to mine?
[01:11:14] <palominoz> seutje: they are simple js objects, though they have been build w/ Classy http://classy.pocoo.org/
[01:11:26] <palominoz> seutje: yeah, dont blame me =D
[01:11:47] <palominoz> seutje: *built
[01:12:02] <Kasimir> gavimobile: It needs a bit of css to make it work for you, but it allows different tweening for different elements
[01:12:25] <Kasimir> gavimobile: also if you could do a jsfiddle of the current slider and I can take a look if I can fix it
[01:12:28] <gavimobile> can you send me a link of the demo your looking at
[01:12:57] <gavimobile> let me check jsfiddle
[01:13:06] <darkmutt> .offset().left
[01:13:22] <darkmutt> this is from the left but left of what? browser window? container obejct or this object?
[01:14:11] <gavimobile> Kasimir: in jsfiddle when it goes from the last slide to the first, it goes backwards.
[01:14:15] <gavimobile> can it be set to infinite
[01:14:17] <gavimobile> ?
[01:14:24] <gavimobile> to make it look like the slides never end?
[01:14:35] <gavimobile> im looking here http://jsfiddle.net/pioul/ba5jh/4/
[01:14:40] <seutje> palominoz: I usually have my class trigger events at certain points when changing attributes so I can catch them from outside of the class, but I don't know if this is the optimal solution
[01:15:11] <gavimobile> found it
[01:15:14] <gavimobile> http://jsfiddle.net/juddlyon/Q2TYv/10/
[01:15:47] <Kasimir> gavimobile: not sure if you know what I mean, paste your code into a new fiddle so I can try to fix it
[01:16:11] <Kasimir> gavimobile: its full of people testing stuff, no out of the box solutions for you
[01:16:23] <gavimobile> Kasimir: ohh,I thought fiddle was a different type of slider
[01:16:48] <gavimobile> do I need to be a member
[01:16:48] <gavimobile> ?
[01:17:06] <Kasimir> gavimobile: its a frame to test javascript and html and css
[01:17:26] <Kasimir> No gavimobile, but if you aint you cant delete it after
[01:22:49] <gavimobile> Kasimir: done http://jsfiddle.net/gavimobile/UmxVn/9/
[01:29:05] <raj> I don't understand why it's not working
[01:29:17] <raj> I can't even user setTimeout to get the value of the paste
[01:29:25] <raj> supposedly, after it should have been pasted
[01:32:03] <gavimobile> raj: you talking to me?
[01:32:16] <raj> no, sorry gavimobile
[01:32:29] <raj> talking to God
[01:32:31] <gavimobile> :-(
[01:37:17] <raj> can someone tell me a failsafe way to get a pasted value?
[01:38:16] <fabioportieri> best way to check a string for a valid filename for windows?
[01:39:40] <pierlooqup> is it possible to select via data attributes regardless of the value? I'm thinking something like $('*[data-attributeName="*"]) â€¦ but doesn't work
[01:39:56] <screamingbanshee> Yes, pierlooqup
[01:40:49] <screamingbanshee> $(selector).data(setname) returns that dataset value or ''
[01:42:03] <screamingbanshee> Or to select elements with that dataset item, like this:
[01:44:10] <screamingbanshee> like this - $("[data-name]")
[01:49:17] <pierlooqup> screamingbanshee: thankyou
[01:49:27] <screamingbanshee> yw :)
[02:11:34] <Stefan_home> is there something wrong with this line of code? $("#cloud-files-table input[name="cloud_options"]").css({"border": "1px solid red"});
[02:12:22] <Cork> "cloud_options"]") <--
[02:12:43] <Cork> you'r using the same quote type in your string as you start the string with
[02:12:54] <Cork> $('#cloud-files-table input[name="cloud_options"]')
[02:12:55] <screamingbanshee> \"
[02:14:18] <screamingbanshee> Things I like about jQuery: jquery is nicer. Possibly the nicest
[02:15:49] <Cork> nicer? nicer then what?
[02:15:55] <raj> http://paste.ofcode.org/W45vLcE6fCMj97aRjrRvyh always gives me a blank value for `val`
[02:15:58] <raj> ''
[02:16:05] <raj> what am I missing?
[02:16:25] <fabioportieri> can you suggest a good enough regex for filename validation in windows?
[02:16:26] <Cork> setTimetout(function() { myFunc(ev) }, 100)
[02:16:39] <fabioportieri> wrong chan srry
[02:16:42] <raj> really?
[02:16:44] <raj> why Cork ?
[02:17:15] <Cork> setTimeout(func(), 100) would only work if func was function func() { return function() {}; }
[02:17:22] <Cork> as func() executes there
[02:17:25] <Stefan_home> Cork: Thanx
[02:17:31] <Cork> and setTimeout takes a function pointer
[02:18:33] <raj> wow, interesting
[02:18:43] <Cork> raj: alternatively you can do setTimeout(myFunc, 100) but then you can't pass ev
[02:18:49] <raj> gotcha
[02:18:54] <screamingbanshee> Just, an observation that the assholery quotient in jquery is drastically lower. (Just witnessed some jerkishness go down elsewhere I don't care to repeat that makes it very obvious)
[02:19:37] <Cork> screamingbanshee: ya, the atmosphere in here is nice
[02:19:38] <tommy34543> hello
[02:21:18] <raj> thank you Cork!
[02:21:55] <raj> I was stuck on that for a while
[02:26:30] <darkmutt_> is there a way to select something in jquery alike to $(".a !.b") or do i have to use has class and ifs??
[02:26:53] <Cork> $('.a').not('.b')
[02:27:14] <darkmutt_> that'll work thanks
[02:27:39] <Cork> you can do $('.a:not(.b)') too but it is a bit slower
[02:32:34] <Stefan_home> How should I let this piece of code, just alert me once? (I have several checkboxes in that form)
[02:32:37] <Stefan_home> http://pastebin.com/Hqwkp5z6
[02:34:23] <fabioportieri> i'm attaching a click handler to a link that is supposed to open a modal dialog in redactorJs.. inside it, if a certain condition fails i make it return false and i do e.preventDefault() + stopPropagation but still after that the modal dialog shows.. am i missing something?
[02:37:41] <fabioportieri> http://pastie.org/7752057
[02:40:19] <fabioportieri> ?
[02:41:38] <chrisTech> I have this: http://jsfiddle.net/XhnF8/ What I want to do is use :-o-prefocus so background only turns red in Opera. I have no idea how to add it to my jquery. Any ideas, or is this not possible? :)
[02:44:17] <Cork> chrisTech: you would have to do ua sniffing and use an if case
[02:44:39] <Cork> (btw why do you want the background to be special in opera?)
[02:45:53] <chrisTech> Cork, it's not really background, that was just an example to simplify things.
[02:46:29] <Cork> chrisTech: the prefixes is going away, so you can't use those to target a specific browser
[02:47:12] <Cork> (and normally you should use feature testing instead of ua testing)
[02:48:27] <chrisTech> Cork, what do you mean feature testing?
[02:56:19] <fabioportieri> i wonder how to unbind redactor modal opening
[03:02:34] <Cork> chrisTech: if you need to do the sniffing cause something doesn't work in opera
[03:02:41] <reload> hey! can anyon hrlp with this code?
[03:02:41] <reload> http://jsfiddle.net/5LVE9/
[03:02:50] <Cork> chrisTech: then you should test for that feature that doesn't work instead of testing for opera
[03:02:56] <reload> is should by it self click on it self evers 2 sec
[03:03:05] <reload> 3sec
[03:03:36] <Cork> reload: you bind a new event listener on the button every 3 sec not trigger it
[03:04:25] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/5LVE9/1/
[03:12:38] <fabioportieri> damn
[03:14:25] <fabioportieri> i'm looking at the code but can't see where the event handlers for toolbar buttons are defined
[03:20:07] <fabioportieri> found it: button.click($.proxy(function()
[03:20:18] <fabioportieri> still why my e.preventDefault() doesn't work?
[03:28:06] <bluesm> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM/EventTarget.addEventListener
[03:28:10] <bluesm> sorry
[03:28:46] <fabioportieri> uhm if i unbind it then how to rebind
[03:37:06] <fabioportieri> i need refactoring redactor js for that since it doesn't use named handlers
[03:38:34] <darkmutt_> var vertical = $(".vertical").not(".horizontal");
[03:38:37] <darkmutt_> is this wrong somehow??
[03:38:53] <lemonsparrow> hi I have a javascript line if (!dwr.util.getValue('revisedName') === ' ') this code block isnt entering when I give === when I give == it enters the block... but when I checked the typeof(dwr.util.getValue('revisedName')) and typeof(' ') both returned string then why isnt === working ?
[03:42:31] <fabioportieri> uhm aniway i have a question about the usage of feature testing vs useragent testing.. i'm looking at redactorJs code, and if i took this line as example: if ($.browser.mozilla) 	{ this.$editor.focus(); } (inside buildButton()) i wonder how that should be translated using features.. i imagine the need for that is cause on firefox  the editor doesn't get autofocused after a button click event, here the redactorJs code: http://past
[03:43:22] <darkmutt_> var vertical = $(".vertical").not(".horizontal");
[03:43:25] <darkmutt_> is this wrong somehow??
[03:47:16] <fabioportieri> darkmutt_: no
[03:47:49] <darkmutt_> that's weird then fabioportieri cause as soon as i changed to using this variable in my code instead of the whole structure it stopped working :/
[03:53:49] <Stefan_home> Finally i've got alerting once working.. http://jsfiddle.net/fDRHZ/
[03:54:16] <Stefan_home> Now, could someone give me a hint how to do the same, once there isn't any checkbox elected anymore?
[03:58:10] <Aamir> Stefan_home:   (this.checked && $notify) || ( $("#cloud-files-table input:checked").length == 0 ) ?
[03:59:31] <Stefan_home> Aamir: hmmm
[04:00:04] <Stefan_home> Aamir: You mean instead of the if ($this.checked && $notify) {?
[04:00:26] <Aamir> I am answering your last question
[04:00:51] <Stefan_home> aah
[04:00:59] <Stefan_home> Aamir, going to fiddle with it
[04:01:01] <Aamir> your questions is not clear though :/
[04:01:03] <Stefan_home> thanks for the hint
[04:01:14] <Aamir> question*
[04:02:24] <Surkow|laptop> good afternoon
[04:05:16] <Surkow|laptop> I have a question about jquery animations combined with translate3d resulting in images disappearing in firefox (v18) and getting stuck in chrome and an earlier version of firefox (v17)
[04:05:21] <Guddu> Dear friends....I am initializing my JQqery Date picker to have a image for button but the image is never rendered. All i see is a Simple Text InputField. Please help. This is how I am initializing my datepicker
[04:05:21] <Guddu> $( "#id_from_date" ).datepicker({dateFormat: 'dd/mm/yy',buttonImageOnly: true, buttonImage: "{{STATIC_URL}}/images/datepicker.png"});
[04:05:44] <Surkow|laptop> I have made an example page to show this behavior: http://surkow.dyndns.org/test/content/
[04:05:53] <darkmutt_> why won't this work after i changed into a variable??
[04:05:53] <darkmutt_> http://jsfiddle.net/LDMhB/
[04:06:38] <Surkow|laptop> my question is if this is a bug in jquery (because this approach worked with a fading slideshow) or that I somehow made a grave javascript mistake
[04:07:15] <Surkow|laptop> the moment you press "pause/play" the images disappear
[04:08:10] <Surkow|laptop> the only problem is that I perform .removeclass on the pause/play button while moving images with the help of css transform
[04:08:33] <Surkow|laptop> if I don't alter the play/pause button the images stay visible
[04:08:41] <Surkow|laptop> (or not stuck with different browsers)
[04:11:32] <Guddu> Please look at this JFiddle to see my problem
[04:11:33] <Guddu> http://jsfiddle.net/fgt8U/
[04:11:43] <Guddu> I am initializing my JQqery Date picker to have a image for button but the image is never rendered. All i see is a Simple Text InputField. Please help.
[04:12:29] <Surkow|laptop> Guddu, the image loads fine
[04:12:38] <Surkow|laptop> but not in the code
[04:12:40] <Surkow|laptop> hmm
[04:12:41] <darkmutt_> please look at my fiddle too
[04:12:41] <darkmutt_> http://jsfiddle.net/LDMhB/
[04:13:14] <Guddu> Surkow|laptop, The image is not loading next to the input field as I was expecting it :(
[04:13:27] <Surkow|laptop> darkmutt_, what exactly is wrong?
[04:13:53] <darkmutt_> before i changed into the var vertical = $(".vertical").not(".horizontal")
[04:14:02] <darkmutt_> it would scale the images in the offset corretly
[04:14:09] <darkmutt_> afterwards that stopped happening at all
[04:16:39] <Guddu> Could it be due to a missing CSS or something? The text field has a class of hasDatepicker . . . Please help
[04:18:02] <Surkow|laptop> darkmutt_, you don't assign the classes you are using
[04:18:38] <Surkow|laptop> Guddu, I haven't used the datepicker before
[04:18:47] <Surkow|laptop> it simply ignores the image
[04:18:50] <Surkow|laptop> it is no css problem
[04:18:59] <darkmutt_> yeah i do surkow the classes have one red one green border on the purpose of noticing that easily
[04:19:02] <Guddu> Ok. THanks Surkow|laptop . . I hope someone else can help me
[04:19:30] <Surkow|laptop> darkmutt_, $(".vertical") --> what do you think this does?
[04:20:17] <Surkow|laptop> do you assign these classes afterwards?
[04:20:40] <Surkow|laptop> because if you do, do you think this variable is updated automatically?
[04:20:42] <melvinram> on http://tentrental.net/, for the element .ngg-widget, I'm trying to use the cycle2 plugin and add the continuous effect to it http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/demo/continuous.php but right now instead of having them scroll together, it's just doing it one by one
[04:20:51] <melvinram> How would I fix this?
[04:21:08] <darkmutt_> that's a selector aaaaaaaaaand that's a point but my point is why when i marked it without the variable using what's on the right side of the equation mark it worked fine
[04:21:24] <darkmutt_> ohhhh that's how it works ok
[04:21:46] <Surkow|laptop> it stays empty
[04:23:55] <darkmutt_> http://jsfiddle.net/LDMhB/1/ though now as i had it before that var
[04:24:06] <darkmutt_> the images get all glitchy and weird sizes appear...
[04:25:19] <Surkow|laptop> the glitching happens because the mouseover changes
[04:27:58] <darkmutt_> don't get why to be honest:/ Surkow|laptop
[04:28:22] <Surkow|laptop> I don't see right away what goes wrong
[04:28:25] <Surkow|laptop> you'd have to debug it
[04:28:30] <Surkow|laptop> like I was doing with my problem
[04:28:44] <Surkow|laptop> I already isolated what trigger my problem
[04:28:48] <Surkow|laptop> by creating a minimal case
[04:28:55] <Surkow|laptop> *triggers
[04:29:04] <Surkow|laptop> but I have no clue why my issue happens either
[04:30:41] <Stefan_home> Aamir: Could it be that you meant ( $("#cloud-files-table input:checked").length === 0 ) instead of the ( $("#cloud-files-table input:checked").length == 0 ) ?
[04:32:36] <Aamir> Stefan_home:  both should work
[04:33:19] <Aamir> Stefan_home:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/359494/javascript-vs-does-it-matter-which-equal-operator-i-use?answertab=active#tab-top
[04:38:14] <melvinram> on http://tentrental.net/, for the element .ngg-widget, I'm trying to use the cycle2 plugin and add the continuous effect to it http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/demo/continuous.php but right now instead of having them scroll together, it's just doing it one by one. Any ideas on how to fix?
[04:40:58] <Surkow|laptop> melvinram, I'm not familiar with that plugin
[04:41:05] <Surkow|laptop> you'll have more luck asking a more specific question
[04:46:07] <melvinram> Surkow|laptop: don't know what's wrong so can't ask a more specific question, either than to say that it should string together the links/image but it's showing them one at a time
[04:46:57] <Surkow|laptop> I normally don't use plugins, I build these things myself
[04:47:10] <Surkow|laptop> I'd have to go jump into the plugin and dissect it
[04:47:13] <Surkow|laptop> before I could give you an answer
[04:47:32] <Surkow|laptop> since I'm stuck with my own problem, I don't think I'll have time for that ;)
[04:47:42] <darkmutt_> not(".vertical").not(".horizontal")
[04:47:56] <darkmutt_> shouldn't this select whatever div's are not vertical or horizontal class?
[04:48:17] <melvinram> Surkow|laptop: k
[04:48:38] <Surkow|laptop> I'm guessing it selects all objects that do not contain the vertical class
[04:48:56] <Surkow|laptop> and then those remaining ones are selected on not containing the horizontal class
[04:49:26] <Surkow|laptop> although I wouldn't try doing it that way, it's not specific enough
[05:06:04] <Guddu> I get an error "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'onSelect'"
[05:06:18] <Guddu> THis is despite that the method is documented on Date Picker http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-onSelect
[05:12:56] <fabioportieri>  i have a question about the usage of feature testing vs useragent testing.. i'm looking at redactorJs code, and if i took this line as example: if ($.browser.mozilla) 	{ this.$editor.focus(); } (inside buildButton()) i wonder how that should be translated using features.. i imagine the need for that is cause on firefox  the editor doesn't get autofocused after a button click event, here the redactorJs code: http://pastie.org/775
[05:19:39] <Stefan_home> Now, is there anyway I could get rid of the $notify variable in here, or make my code a bit more efficient? http://jsfiddle.net/fDRHZ/2/
[05:33:36] <Stefan_home> Aamir: You still around to have a look at my code here? http://jsfiddle.net/fDRHZ/3/
[05:33:37] <Qdest> http://jsfiddle.net/2b3GK/6/ <-- could someone take a look and help me figure out how to improve the logic when moving items? Basically I'm trying to move X items X steps in Y direction. So if 5 items are visible and there's 8 total, it should, when hitting "up" move 5 items up viewing the 3 that are left... and prevent one from going further.
[05:34:27] <Stefan_home> Aamir: Could you imagine a way to get rid of the $notify var, but keep the functionality the same? Or make my code a bit more efficient?
[05:48:29] <ddlk> Hi.
[05:49:17] <ddlk> Anyone know how to get the Date header before an ajax been sent?
[05:50:45] <Cork> don't think you can
[05:50:50] <Cork> as the browser sets it
[05:51:11] <Cork> you might be able to set it you're self though
[05:51:37] <ddlk> Chrome didn't let me do this.
[05:51:52] <ddlk> need the date header to calculate a signature
[05:59:06] <lenswipee> Cork: hi, how do i trigger a dialogue box to open on the server-side (PHP)?
[06:01:20] <fabioportieri> feature testing is a bitch
[06:02:24] <darkmutt_> why ask about php on jquery lenswipee ?
[06:03:14] <lenswipee> Cork: hi, how do i trigger a jQuery UI dialogue box to open on the server-side (PHP)?
[06:03:25] <lenswipee> or anyone
[06:03:47] <fabioportieri> the question doesn't really make sense
[06:05:38] <lenswipee> OK, how to auto open the box when a page loads
[06:07:56] <fabioportieri> have you seen the examples in the docs?
[06:08:41] <lenswipee> where fabio?
[06:11:20] <Stefan_home> lenswipee: Did you even tried to google that at all?
[06:11:53] <TigerParket> i have <ul class="menu"><li><ul class="menu"><li><ul class="menu"><li></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul> and i want to add a class LastChild to the last ul.menu child - how can i do it with jquery ?
[06:12:05] <fabioportieri> lenswipee: there are examples in the jquery ui site, correct?
[06:12:28] <lenswipee> fabioportieri: not about auto triggering
[06:12:54] <fabioportieri> lenswipee: you asked how to open your widget on page load
[06:13:32] <fabioportieri> and i'm sure there are examples about that on the docs
[06:14:05] <lenswipee> i'll check again but me no see
[06:14:24] <fabioportieri> something like $(document).ready(function() {   $("#stuff").stuff(); });
[06:16:21] <lenswipee> that is not auto triggering.
[06:16:34] <fabioportieri> that is what you asked about
[06:16:53] <fabioportieri> i don't know what do you mean by auto triggering
[06:21:21] <lenswipee> I think Cork knows.
[06:21:59] <kai> hi folks. I've got a webapp where I allow users to upload text-based files, and I'd like to do some sanity checking prior to uploading the file to the server. is there a way to do this?
[06:24:25] <Surkow|laptop> hmm, I think I finally figured out what went wrong. Can anyone who has firefox above v18 test if there is a transform (sliding) in the following page after pressing pause? http://surkow.dyndns.org/test/content/
[06:24:46] <Surkow|laptop> I'm using a firefox 18 nightly version which can't update due to glibc issues
[06:24:58] <Surkow|laptop> so I guess I stumbled onto an old transform bug
[06:25:04] <Surkow|laptop> it doesn't appear to happen with chrome
[06:25:16] <develkar> hello all, this is my first time here. So, I apologize in advance for my mistakes. I am creating a trying to make a player responsive using jquery. My function is like this : http://pastebin.com/KRJNV9jz
[06:25:30] <lenswipee> ok, how about how to call a function when a class is present?
[06:25:42] <develkar> this works with some bugs onresize, but I want to call the function onload as well
[06:25:46] <JohnBo> Surkow|laptop, transforming alright
[06:25:47] <develkar> how can this be done?
[06:26:18] <Surkow|laptop> JohnBo, what happens if you press pause when there is a transform happening?
[06:26:37] <Surkow|laptop> in v18 firefox it results in a disappearing division
[06:27:12] <lenswipee> $('.foo').function() {}; //does not work, invalid syntax
[06:27:49] <JohnBo> Surkow|laptop, Disappearing division? Nothing happens, the transform finishes then its paused.
[06:27:50] <lenswipee> $('p.foo').function() {}; //does not work, invalid syntax
[06:28:04] <Surkow|laptop> JohnBo, thanks - I mistakenly assumed it was a bug in my code
[06:28:10] <Surkow|laptop> turns out it's a bug in firefox..
[06:28:17] <kai> lenswipee: I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to do
[06:28:31] <JohnBo> Surkow|laptop, No problems, yeah transforms are never fun
[06:28:37] <Aamir> Stefan_home:  http://jsfiddle.net/fDRHZ/5/
[06:28:52] <lenswipee> kai: i'm trying to call a function when <p class="on"> is present in html
[06:28:56] <Surkow|laptop> JohnBo, do you perhaps know a fallback for browsers who can't deal with these transforms?
[06:29:44] <kai> lenswipee: $('.foo').func() calls func() on the return of $('.foo'), which should be a list
[06:30:00] <JohnBo> Surkow|laptop, Not that I can think of, no :(
[06:30:05] <kaichanvong> Cool name kai :)
[06:30:20] <kai> where 'on' means a member function of the object returned by $('.foo')
[06:30:22] <Surkow|laptop> hmm ok
[06:30:27] <kai> kaichanvong: :)
[06:30:49] <kai> lenswipee: do you want to call your function once or for every element?
[06:30:56] <lenswipee> kai: 'on' is a class name of <p>
[06:31:08] <kai> lenswipee: I meant my sentence...
[06:31:30] <lenswipee> kai: if html page is loaded and has <p class="on"> then call a function
[06:31:47] <kai> lenswipee: $('.foo').func() calls the func() memeber function of the list returned by $('.foo')
[06:31:51] <lenswipee> kai: call once on page as there is only one
[06:32:03] <kai> which is most likely not what you want
[06:32:42] <lenswipee> kai: i tried $('.on').function(){ //code } and it not work
[06:32:50] <lenswipee> invalid syntax
[06:34:10] <fabioportieri> lenswipee: if ($('.on').length > 0) func(); perhaps?
[06:34:23] <kai> lenswipee: so something like "if ($('.foo').length > 0) { do_something(); }"
[06:34:44] <lenswipee> fabioportieri: well done! that worked
[06:35:50] <lenswipee> and thank you kai
[06:36:46] <fabioportieri> who wants to help me understand feature testing
[06:36:54] <fabioportieri> i have a testcase

[06:45:37] <develkar> hello all, this is my first time here. So, I apologize in advance for my mistakes. I am creating a trying to make a player responsive using jquery. My function is like this : http://pastebin.com/KRJNV9jz
[06:45:42] <develkar> this works with some bugs onresize, but I want to call the function onload as well
[06:45:44] <develkar> how can this be done?
[06:48:58] <fabioportieri> develkar: put your function inside $(document).ready(function() {   //here });
[06:49:21] <caddoo> If jqueryui is loaded on the page already. but doesn't include slider and buttons. How could I add them without breaking things.
[06:49:31] <caddoo> I can't change the original jqueryui loaded by the page
[06:49:42] <develkar> fabioportieri, thanks I will post back the result immediately
[06:49:55] <fabioportieri> any help with $.proxy? http://pastie.org/7753035
[06:51:17] <develkar> fabioportieri, I tried that , replaced the comment with the function call but the changes weren't applied
[06:51:47] <fabioportieri> caddoo: iirc in jquery ui you can choose your components when downloading it so first thing i would try is to download only the componenet needed. not sure if the core is still required to be downloaded tho
[06:52:39] <develkar> fabioportieri, I also tried with $(window).load(function() {  //here }
[06:52:49] <develkar> but still the code isn't getting applied
[06:53:05] <develkar> I did an alert call inside the function to make sure it is being called
[06:53:24] <fabioportieri> develkar: get firebug and console.log stuff inside your function and or inside document.ready so you will see what's wrong
[06:53:53] <fabioportieri> repaste code so we can see if something is wrong
[06:56:16] <fabioportieri> nevermind my last question isolved it, but still if someone want to help me understand features
[06:56:28] <develkar> fabioportieri, the code is here : http://pastie.org/7753060

[06:57:05] <develkar> I tried to output the a string in console.log() but that wasn't being called
[06:57:12] <fabioportieri> develkar: function () <- that space is no good
[06:57:14] <develkar> that means the function is not called at all
[06:57:56] <develkar> fabioportieri, I'm sorry I am from Drupal background so using those coding standards
[06:58:10] <fabioportieri> remember that's js not php
[06:59:03] <develkar> right, I will keep that in mind

[07:44:28] <Surkow|laptop> the most important bits you might be interested in are the switch function and next, previous

[07:47:27] <Surkow|laptop> if the current number is larger than the number of images available
[07:47:33] <Surkow|laptop> it simply starts over again

[07:50:57] <Assim_Work> this works in firefox, but not chrome: http://dot.aquaveo.com/index.php?q=sMap.php. Click on the bottom right button above the map labeld HY-8. It appears that in chrome the .click method used on lines 148 and 150 of smap.php don't trigger the change method on line 155? any adeas why, or is there a better approach I should use?
[07:52:23] <Assim_Work> it appears to be quite erratic on when it triggers appropriate methods and it doesn't from clicking around I'm having a hard time discerning a pattern in failures
[07:53:34] <daanavitch> any photo slider recommendations?
[07:53:41] <daanavitch> something really really simple
[07:54:25] <cwatson> daanavitch: http://bxslider.com/ ?
[07:54:28] <Assim_Work> daanavitch: I have never used it but I've heard good things about Nivo Slider: http://dot.aquaveo.com/index.php?q=sMap.php
[07:54:34] <Assim_Work> sorry, wrong link
[07:54:49] <Assim_Work> http://dev7studios.com/nivo-slider/
[07:54:53] <Assim_Work> clipboard fail, lol
[07:55:04] <sunbeam> whats the best way to toggle check all checkboxes with a certain class?
[07:55:33] <Assim_Work> sunbeam: $('checkbox.myClass').click()
[07:55:45] <daanavitch> Assim_Work: nivo is too heavyweight for what I need
[07:56:06] <Assim_Work> daanavitch: k, i'm not sure then, sorry
[07:56:13] <Aamir> Stefan_home: np :)
[07:56:21] <sunbeam> Assim_Work: no i mean toggle
[07:56:22] <sunbeam> and check them all
[07:56:33] <Stefan_home> Aamir: :-) Thank you, once again
[07:56:44] <cwatson> daanavitch: http://bxslider.com/ ?
[07:59:54] <Assim_Work> sunbeam: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/ugsN9/3/
[08:00:16] <daanavitch> cwatson: gonna try it out, thanks
[08:01:17] <sunbeam> nvm sorruy Assim_Work
[08:01:18] <sunbeam> yes
[08:01:35] <sunbeam> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4177159/jquery-toggle-checkboxes-on-off
[08:01:37] <Assim_Work> sunbeam: also depending on preference instead of !$().is() you could just use $().not()
[08:01:38] <sunbeam> Assim_Work: that
[08:02:18] <sunbeam> how do I detect if any checkboxes are checked inside a class?
[08:02:22] <Assim_Work> sunbeam: unless you're trying to avoid triggering events .click() will do the same thing
[08:03:04] <Assim_Work> sunbeam: $('.myclass:checked').length > 0
[08:03:48] <fabioportieri> if i do this button.on("click.default",$.proxy(this.defaultCallbackForButtons(key,s), this)); then to unbind i'm supposed  to do $('.redactor_btn_image').off('click.default');, right?
[08:05:02] <sunbeam> Assim_Work: i also need to prevent default behaviour
[08:05:04] <sunbeam> for example
[08:05:16] <sunbeam> if there are any checkboxes checked
[08:05:21] <sunbeam> and the master checkbox is clicked
[08:07:18] <sunbeam> so basically I need to detect if not all checkboxes with a certain class are checked
[08:07:30] <sunbeam> if all, do usual behaviour (means uncheck them all)
[08:07:52] <sunbeam> if not all, uncheck them all but also uncheck the master checkbx
[08:09:04] <Assim_Work> sunbeam: so it sounds like you figured it out from the stack overflow, am I wrong? if not maybe make a fiddle to help visualize what you're trying to do?
[08:16:08] <dimaursu16> guys, how can I bring up the keyboard of a tablet on some event?
[08:16:30] <dimaursu16> I know how to bind events, but I have no idea what I need to call for the keyboard...
[08:16:43] <dimaursu16> I have both jquery and jquery mobile...
[08:16:51] <ablomen> dimaursu16, focus an input field?
[08:17:28] <tomshreds> Hi! I'm using lazy loading in a container. But for some reason the first images don't get loaded until I scroll a little. Any way of triggering the first ones? thanks
[08:17:34] <dimaursu16> hmm..but the element I want the focus to be is <canvas>
[08:17:39] * tomshreds I use this one http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload
[08:17:47] <dimaursu16> not sure if that is posible...
[08:18:30] <SynchronE> hi everyone
[08:18:52] <SynchronE> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox seems to be broken
[08:19:12] <ablomen> dimaursu16, i don't think so, but you can capture the events on the input and use these to do stuff on the canvas can't you?
[08:19:15] <bluesm> Hey.
[08:19:27] <bluesm> Does .data automatically parse json strings ?
[08:20:10] <SeanJM> I have a few scripts that are bound to $('html') -- and I'd like to not have conflicts. So far, one script kills the other, :-(
[08:21:21] <bluesm> @bluesm  When the data attribute is an object (starts with '{') or array (starts with '[') thenÂ jQuery.parseJSONÂ is used to parse the string; it must followÂ valid JSON syntaxÂ including quoted property names.
[08:22:44] <dimaursu16> ablomen, hmm... I'm not sure...that canvas is filled with images from guacamole...
[08:24:24] <fabioportieri> how can i pass event argument in a named handler?
[08:24:32] <ablomen> dimaursu16, how does mexican food affect your script?
[08:26:01] <ablomen> dimaursu16, anyway, focusing on an input should bring up the keyboard, you could fire a focus event on something else after that if you wish
[08:26:29] <ablomen> but my work day is over, time for beer

[08:31:32] <Ryan-Woods> with ie8 that is
[08:31:42] <Ryan-Woods> it works in ie9+
[08:31:52] <Ryan-Woods> Can anyone offer a moment of assistance?
[08:33:45] <fabioportieri> nobody?
[08:34:07] <d3d3d3> seems so
[08:34:15] <BillCriswell> fabioportieri: I'm not too familiar with $.proxy, but what would s be?
[08:34:30] <fabioportieri> BillCriswell: don't mind .proxy, assume it's not there at all
[08:34:45] <fabioportieri> s is a variable defined in that scope
[08:35:06] <fabioportieri> and the handler recognizes s fine, is e the issue
[08:35:18] <Ryan-Woods> $('<input>').attr('type', 'text').attr({ 'Id': 'searchAttribute_' + attributeData['Id'], 'size': 100 }).html(($(this).attr('Name'))).data('SearchCriteria', attributeData);        this line is failing in ie8 but not 9 or 10, is there something that is obvious to someone else as to why it won't work?
[08:35:33] <BillCriswell> fabioportieri: Sadly I'm not too familiar with what you're tyring to do and a bit busy, but you can do this: http://jsbin.com/ifagig/1/edit
[08:36:25] <oakdog8> Hey, I'm not sure I'm doing this 100% correctly. I have a few images and I want to show a caption for each one when a user hovers.

[08:58:52] <cwatson> Almost got it, dang it - http://jsfiddle.net/AxURN/14/
[08:59:06] <sunbeam> Assim_Work: somehow
[08:59:48] <BillCriswell> oakdog8: You don't even really need to loop through them ( with your code ). You can do something along the lines of $('img').on('mouseover', function(){ /* Some code to show a caption, could grab the images alt tag or something */ })
[09:01:59] <furyFoo> Hello everyone .
[09:02:00] <furyFoo> I'm trying to trigger action A if my var value is 1,2,4,5,7,8 or action B if the value is 3,6,9;
[09:02:00] <furyFoo> Any indication on how to do that without using a bloated switch statement ?
[09:02:18] <oakdog8> BillCriswell: Well, there are other images on the page. I just want to do it for a specific set. And the captions are each their own div that has some HTML/CSS, so I can't just store it as alt-text. Right now the function works, except for the fact that every image I hover over shows the div for item4.
[09:03:09] <BillCriswell> oakdog8: So $('.captioned-things img').on('mouseover', fn);
[09:03:25] <BillCriswell> How are the divs related to the img?
[09:04:44] <afrance> furry: how many values are you talking about and how many to exclude?  just the 9 with three excluded?  Just do a simple if else...
[09:05:45] <oakdog8> BillCriswell: Each div is a sort of caption, but I want them all to show in the same place. So there's a little caption box and the text changes when you roll over different images
[09:06:15] <BillCriswell> furyFoo: $.inArray().. or if number is divisible evenly by three.
[09:08:32] <BillCriswell> furyFoo: So if( foo % 3 === 0 ) { b(foo); } else { a(foo) }
[09:08:51] <furyFoo> Thanks i was already on it .
[09:09:20] <furyFoo> But then i just realized that i could use a remainder but that would solve only half the issue . Basically i have a 3 x 3 grid formed of 9 divs . If the user clicks 1 or 2 then #3 is set modified , if #3 is clicked then #2 is moddified
[09:09:32] <BillCriswell> oakdog8: Where are the captions relative to the image through? Is there anything associating the two? Placement in the DOM, classnames? Etc?
[09:09:35] <furyFoo> And the action is the same for each row .
[09:10:26] <oakdog8> BillCriswell: I've given them IDs like #item1-img and #item1-text, but otherwise there isn't anything associating the two
[09:11:46] <BillCriswell> oakdog8: Are they in the same order as the images?
[09:12:42] <oakdog8> No, but I suppose they could be. Each text div is just one after another with display:none by default, and the images are in column wrappers
[09:13:19] <afrance> Why not just set the caption to something like data-caption on the item your hovering then set the contents of the div you want to display to the value of the hovered items data-caption?
[09:13:49] <afrance> Why mess around with a whole other set of divs just to hold the caption?
[09:14:30] <BillCriswell> They have HTML  in them from what I understand.
[09:14:40] <BillCriswell> Not that it would stop it from working, but could be icky.
[09:17:48] <oakdog8> afrance: that's a nice suggestion
[09:18:19] <afrance> hmm.. then are the hovered items and the caption wrapped in something? IE: <div class="wrap"><img><div class="caption</div></div> you could use closest and just get the closest div.caption?
[09:19:37] <oakdog8> Yeah right now it's like <div class="item-text">HTML caption</div> for all the captions, and then <div class="img-column"><img class="item-img">...</div> for a few columns
[09:20:29] <BillCriswell> oakdog8: http://jsbin.com/ivubul/1/edit would work, but far from ideal readabilty wise.
[09:22:19] <oakdog8> BillCriswell: thanks. Any insight into why my original script didn't work? Every image shows something on hover, but it's always the same text (last one in the array)
[09:22:41] <BillCriswell> oakdog8: Sounds like a typical closure issue.
[09:23:28] <BillCriswell> Yeah, that's the issue. Never create functions inside loops.
[09:23:57] <NoiseEee> http://www.mennovanslooten.nl/blog/post/62 @ oakdog8
[09:24:09] <lejocelyn> do I need to do a $.parseJSON(data) on the data from a success ajax ??
[09:24:53] <oakdog8> aha, that looks quite helpful, NoiseEee. Thanks guys.
[09:25:34] <BillCriswell> lejocelyn: It depends on the dataType that's set.
[09:25:48] <lejocelyn> json
[09:26:00] <BillCriswell> You're good then.
[09:26:22] <BillCriswell> oakdog8: No problem.
[09:27:12] <lejocelyn> thanks BillCriswell
[09:27:32] <BillCriswell> Would I use "then" or "than" there? "You're good, then".
[09:28:12] <BillCriswell> lejocelyn: No problem!
[09:28:48] <shoky> then!
[09:29:37] <BillCriswell> shoky: That's what my gut tells me, but isn't there kind of a comparison happening though?
[09:30:27] <BillCriswell> good
[09:30:31] <Andrew_R> than == comparison, then is for everything else
[09:32:19] <BillCriswell> Andrew_R: Yeah.. probably thinking about it too much.

[09:36:50] <sunbeam> hi, i'm looking for a way to get all <tr> that have a td.check input taht is :checked
[09:36:53] <sunbeam> any idea how I can best do this?
[09:38:04] <afrance> Is that typo on type something you just pasted in or typed in?
[09:39:01] <davidmahoney> anyone know
[09:41:38] <Ebonwumon> I have a page with two divs of class "wc-cal-event" but the selector $('.wc-cal-event') only returns the first one.
[09:41:46] <Ebonwumon> any idea what might be the cause?
[09:41:56] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: look for <td>s that have inputs that are checked as your initial selector, then .each() them to find the .closest tr and record them
[09:42:19] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: ok will try thanks
[09:55:04] <afrance> cwatson: I think you need to take a different approach.  For example, instead of adding and subtracting 632 from each movement from the left, set the left using 632 * the current slide.  Set your slidecount using the count of <li>s, etc...
[09:55:29] <pfFredd> afrance, thanks! didn't see it

[09:55:50] <b-ot> Ebonwumon: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:59:37] <clov3r> assim_work: can't see the php code
[10:01:04] <clov3r> on chrome for me, clicking the button toggles the button itself, while on firefox it toggles that button and the "showall/show only selected"
[10:01:12] <clov3r> not sure if it should do anything to the map
[10:02:21] <Assim_Work> clov3r: so the php is mostly irrelevant, the key issue is the post data getting sent to php. Clicking on HY-8 should hide all the markers (or show them)
[10:02:57] <Assim_Work> clov3r: also when you click on one of the twelve lower calcs, if they're all selected or all not selected it should adjust the top right two buttons appropriately as well
[10:03:14] <Assim_Work> clov3r: each click of any of the 12, or top right two or top left three should send an ajax call
[10:04:25] <Assim_Work> and ofc appropriate post data should be sent, if show all is selected than calcSelect won't be sent as a key, otherwise it will
[10:04:44] <Assim_Work> another thing chrome is not doing....
[10:06:33] <shoky> davidmahoney: do you mean like this?  http://jsfiddle.net/ytBqG/11/
[10:07:42] <davidmahoney> shoky: yes how did you do that?
[10:08:38] <shoky> davidmahoney: changed the css. main stuff was changing the boxes from table-cell to inline-block, then worked around that
[10:29:35] <davidmahoney> shoky: I have jquery question
[10:30:29] <davidmahoney> so I am using $('button').one(click,function) whenever I go in that function I lose my global variable
[10:30:42] <davidmahoney> I think because it is a callback
[10:48:06] <davidmahoney> can anyone help me out http://pastebin.com/tTS0HLwG
[10:48:31] <davidmahoney> so what is happening is the global array's data is going to crap in the update function
[10:51:07] <bluesm> If I look for ID
[10:51:33] <bluesm> I should use just the $("#my-id")
[10:51:51] <bluesm> Not  $("#mycontainer").find("#my-id")

[10:54:10] <TigerPar_> hello folks
[10:54:48] <TigerPar_> I really need ur help, i have a tree like this http://jsfiddle.net/f6MNQ/2/ and i need to add a class .product to each product
[10:55:56] <NoiseEee> TigerPar_: you can't get that marked up in any nicer way?  if not, look at :contains
[10:56:27] <TigerPar_> NoiseEee it's marked up with Drupal menu block :/
[10:57:35] <NoiseEee> $('li:contains("Product")').addClass('product'); @ TigerPar_
[10:58:07] <TigerPar_> NoiseEee its only an example products have a dynamic name
[10:58:16] <NoiseEee> actually that gets too much hold on
[10:58:32] <TigerPar_> NoiseEee products are everytime the last li on a category
[10:58:44] <TigerPar_> each category will have at once a product
[10:59:05] <davidmahoney> anyone good in closure of callbacks I think that is where my problem is
[10:59:06] <TigerPar_> I just dont know how to select all ul.menu last li
[10:59:22] <NoiseEee> TigerPar_: well that's rather useless as you don't have "category" defined in any way (ie: with a class)
[10:59:55] <NoiseEee> TigerPar_: but that direction would only highlight the last <li>Product</li>
[11:00:04] <davidmahoney> http://pastebin.com/EZdanqyv
[11:00:14] <TigerPar_> NoiseEee its ok for me to hilght products
[11:00:16] <TigerPar_> only
[11:00:21] <davidmahoney> i think line 11 I think I am might be doing that worng
[11:01:08] <NoiseEee> TigerPar_: but in <ul class='menu'><li>Product</li><li>Product</li></ul> you want both <li>s right? not just the last?
[11:01:34] <TigerPar_> NoiseEee yes
[11:01:56] <NoiseEee> not gonna happen really, as far as i can tell, sorry
[11:02:15] <TigerPar_> i tried several ways for two hours :)
[11:02:30] <TigerPar_> sure ?
[11:02:41] <TigerPar_> I think with jquery everything is possible
[11:02:47] <TigerPar_> it will just be longer
[11:02:49] <davidmahoney> NoiseEee any good with closure in javascript
[11:02:49] <TigerPar_> or in two lines
[11:03:39] <NoiseEee> TigerPar_: well i can't see how you'd differentiate between a subcategory and a product.
[11:05:16] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/f6MNQ/3/ @ TigerPar_
[11:05:53] <TigerPar_> You see
[11:05:56] <TigerPar_> You're the hero
[11:06:04] <TigerPar_> that's exactly what i was tryin to do
[11:06:08] <TigerPar_> with .last and .has
[11:06:16] <TigerPar_> this way is better
[11:06:18] <TigerPar_> thanks

[11:17:55] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: thanks
[11:18:04] <sunbeam> where does el stand for ;) ?
[11:18:39] <Brodingo> element
[11:18:40] <NoiseEee> the element of the collection you're iterating over.
[11:19:11] <sunbeam> ah
[11:19:42] <wilkinsmc> brodingo: oic
[11:20:02] <davidmahoney> do Ihave to make function inside the for loop for the closure
[11:20:29] <Brodingo> wilkinsmc yeah, box-shadow: 2px 0 0 #000, -2px 0 0 #000
[11:21:32] <wilkinsmc> if i add any more it seems to take away the first
[11:21:33] <shoky> davidmahoney:  you don't need that function inside the loop, in your case. you only need to do that if you have an asynchronous callback nested inside the loop
[11:21:53] <wilkinsmc> so far i have: -webkit-box-shadow: 3px 3px 4px #000;
[11:21:58] <davidmahoney> shoky i is always the last number
[11:23:01] <shoky> davidmahoney: it's always the last number where?
[11:23:28] <NoiseEee> davidmahoney: read over http://www.mennovanslooten.nl/blog/post/62 a little closer
[11:23:41] <NoiseEee> seems you're very close :)
[11:23:41] <Brodingo> wilkinsmc http://jsfiddle.net/Brodingo/jnDQd/
[11:24:13] <NoiseEee> back to work
[11:24:22] <davidmahoney> I have been reading that I thought I was doing it righ
[11:25:11] <wilkinsmc> got it to work, sorta
[11:25:55] <shoky> davidmahoney: where are you seeing that i is the last number ?
[11:25:55] <NoiseEee> davidmahoney: if you take it to a workable fiddle maybe it will be easier
[11:26:26] <davidmahoney> it works fine in the jfiddle I don't why
[11:26:53] <davidmahoney> shoky: in the console
[11:27:21] <Andrew_R> can anyone give me an idea how to resize the custom drop down box correctly here? http://jsfiddle.net/msQL8/
[11:27:27] <wilkinsmc> awww ya
[11:27:33] <wilkinsmc> got it to work like a boss
[11:29:12] <Brodingo> woooo
[11:32:31] <cwatson> Now start twerkin'
[11:32:31] <davidmahoney> figured it out it didn't like using indexOf
[11:32:52] <davidmahoney> I have no idea why but it is working now
[11:34:34] <ravenzz> Andrew_R the custom select width is setted by the plugin
[11:35:15] <Andrew_R> ravenzz: yes I know, I need to resize it somehow
[11:35:44] <Andrew_R> in my real code, the container is a percentage based width that will resize when the browser is resized
[11:36:12] <ravenzz> I see, well I think that you could actually set its width to auto
[11:36:21] <ravenzz> auto !important
[11:37:13] <OneBraveHog> if I have a javascript include stores in ../../myscript.js     what does the ../../ infer ?  two directories up from root ?
[11:37:24] <OneBraveHog> sry wrong chan
[11:37:27] <PerlWebDev> no
[11:37:28] <OneBraveHog> meant this for javascript
[11:37:42] <PerlWebDev> 2 directories up from where ever your CWD is set to
[11:38:17] <Andrew_R> ravenzz: that might work, if I also change the plugin code to use absolute positioning for the new elements it creates instead of setting the width of the input manually
[11:38:59] <Andrew_R> *manually = inline
[11:42:41] <ravenzz> Andrew_R yeah
[11:44:01] <ravenzz> Andrew_R anyway my policy is style the select with CSS3's appearance property and fallback to the native one when it is not supported
[11:47:48] <shoky> Andrew_R: http://jsfiddle.net/msQL8/1/
[11:50:51] <ravenzz> shoky he has a fluid layout which means that setDimensions should be called on resize multiple times :\
[11:54:48] <shoky> ravenzz: yah css is better, but that's how the plugin he's using works..
[11:55:29] <Andrew_R> ravenzz, shoky: I think it will work: http://jsfiddle.net/msQL8/2/
[11:56:18] <ravenzz> Andrew_R that's what I was talking about :) and "downvoting"
[11:56:47] <Passionate> hello , i am having very strange problem . jQuery(document).ready(function($) { } is not working . but (function($){ $("select").select2(); })(jQuery) is working property . Please help
[11:57:06] <Andrew_R> yeah I understand your objects to it
[11:57:38] <Andrew_R> for CSS only to work though, I'd have to wrap every <select> with a container with a specific width I want (percentage or px width)
[11:58:39] <Passionate> Anyone ?
[11:58:53] <ravenzz> Andrew_R I don't think so..let me try
[12:00:19] <Andrew_R> The HTML that replaces the <select> has to be sized to the same dimensions. $().width and $().css('width') both only give you values in px, even if the width is set to a percentage
[12:00:34] <clov3r> Passionate: you have the right brackets / ;'s
[12:00:35] <clov3r> ?
[12:01:16] <Passionate> yes, i missed here .. but that's not the issue
[12:01:29] <delboy1978uk_> whats the best image crop plugin for jquery?
[12:01:34] <Passionate> clov3r,
[12:01:40] <shoky> `demo @ Passionate
[12:01:40] <b-ot> Passionate: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:01:51] <ravenzz> Andrew_R hold on
[12:01:58] <Passionate> ok
[12:01:59] <Andrew_R> ravenzz: thank you
[12:02:26] <OneBraveHog> anyone use Jquerymobile here ?
[12:02:42] <OneBraveHog> chan says invite only
[12:04:04] <ravenzz> Andrew_R holy crap you can't :P the dropdown list is not child of .ufd
[12:04:41] <ctienrsg> Hope not offtopic: Can someone tell me if the javascript tutorials on codeschool are worth the money they want?
[12:04:51] <ravenzz> maybe it is shared by the dropdowns :\
[12:05:46] <Andrew_R> ravenzz: yeah it's tricky, percentage sized selects weren't really thought out in this plugin
[12:07:00] <Passionate> sorry, it very complex to show live example . it will be very helpful if you just tell me when this type of problem occurs ? shoky , b-ot ...
[12:07:25] <Andrew_R> ravenzz, shoky the window.resize using .data('ufd').setDimensions() is working in my code, except it's registering a couple errors in the console in IE.
[12:07:34] <sebumd> is there something special about making an ajax request and returning a JSON object that contains "AuthResult"?  My response is:
[12:07:35] <sebumd> {"AuthResult":"fail"}  and it's calling the "error" callback function when I call $.ajax...
[12:07:36] <shoky> Passionate:  cant be helpful if you cant show the actual problem. (and your description wasnt clear at all)
[12:08:37] <Andrew_R> apparently my select doesn't have .data('ufd') right away (and window.resize is being called automatically because it's loaded via ajax)
[12:08:38] <shoky> sebumd: i don't believe there's anything special like that..
[12:08:43] <Andrew_R> yes, lots of complications...
[12:09:14] <ravenzz> ctienrsg which one?
[12:09:54] <sebumd> shoky: is there something else that I can request to get more debugging info?  its via mobile so I can't just console.log stuff.  request.responseText is always my "success" or "fail" and the erorr callback is always called
[12:10:32] <sebumd> shoky: the same request in chrome gives me a 200 response tho, nothing weird about it..
[12:10:42] <shoky> sebumd: responseText is success or fail?  that doesn't look like json
[12:10:44] <ctienrsg> ravenzz: thought of those: http://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript
[12:11:09] <ctienrsg> anyone who tried this already?
[12:11:20] <shoky> sebumd: do you see JSON in the devtools network tab, looking at the actual request?
[12:11:24] <sebumd> shoky: yeah, my response is DEFINITELY {"AuthResult":"fail"} but request.responseText in my error callback is always the key of authresult
[12:11:40] <ravenzz> ctienrsg I'd like to suggest you to start with eloquentjavascript.net and then http://jqfundamentals.com/ ! Those are good resources. Later you could practise and review your knowledge on Codecademy or websites like Codeschool if you like. You'll notice that you know MORE than what they teach.
[12:11:48] <sebumd> shoky: Its a phonegap app so debugging is difficult...
[12:12:47] <ctienrsg> ravenzz: thank you for the link. I will try it
[12:12:51] <ajpiano> ctienrsg: you can always do the http://try.jquery.com if you want to see what the codeschool courses are like
[12:12:53] <sebumd> shoky: so if my result is {"AuthResult":"asdasdfdsfsdf"}, request.ResponseText will be "asdasdfdsfsdf"
[12:13:02] <sebumd> and it's always in the error callback for some reason!
[12:13:07] <ctienrsg> ajpiano: did this already :)
[12:13:12] <ajpiano> ah, what'd you think
[12:13:31] <ctienrsg> very good for absolute beginner
[12:13:47] <shoky> sebumd: i dunno.. what does your ajax code look like..
[12:14:31] <ctienrsg> but i will try the thing ravenzz suggested probably. And without writing much code myself I won't get the experience anyways
[12:14:33] <shoky> sebumd: also, what happens when you send back {"Bla":"bla"}
[12:15:32] <sebumd> shoky: http://pastebin.com/3X3B6Gxk   changing the key from "AuthResult" to something else is difficult because it's in .NET and I don't know .NET that well...was written by someone else :/
[12:15:34] <davidmahoney> this is crazy replacing a element in string
[12:15:36] <ravenzz> ctienrsg hehe read a bit about js and jQuery and start a dummy project so that you can practise
[12:16:31] <harpal> I have two div, when page is scrolled up I would like to overlap second div on first div. reverse for scrolled down. how to achieve that?
[12:16:34] <ctienrsg> already many nice ideas for my favourite open source projects :) But efficient learning will be necesary
[12:16:40] <davidmahoney> shoky: am I crazy this should work righthttp://pastebin.com/rYK3vnzn
[12:16:44] <davidmahoney> http://pastebin.com/rYK3vnzn
[12:17:26] <davidmahoney> it is replace a value in a array
[12:17:31] <ctienrsg> harpal: you thought about z-index?
[12:17:40] <davidmahoney> it is not complicated
[12:18:20] <shoky> sebumd: eh, an alert won't necessarily show you the actual string.. also.. what's status and error?
[12:18:58] <harpal> ctienrsg: Yes z-index I have applied, but how would I know that its scrolled up or down and stop overlap if its completely overlap to first div?
[12:20:11] <ctienrsg> I recently had a problem which differed a bit (it was a sidebar on an entire page at which guys here helped me much)
[12:20:33] <ctienrsg> But maybe its close, wait a second for pastebin
[12:20:36] <sebumd> shoky: the datatype is html, so it SHOULD show me the whole string, right?  alerting both status and error give me the string?  weird as hell, right?
[12:21:39] <shoky> sebumd: no, alerts in general are not reliable for showing strings.. what do you mean, it gives you the string? ?
[12:22:06] <sebumd> shoky: yeah it gives me the value of the key "authresult" it seems...i know alerts aren't good but it's all i have in phonegap easily
[12:23:19] <sebumd> shoky: thanks for the help, pulling this request out of phonegap and into a flat html file i can test in chrome i guess..
[12:23:45] <ctienrsg> harpal: doesnt work for some weird reason but u get the code: http://jsfiddle.net/DZTUF/
[12:23:47] <shoky> sebumd: sry donno anything bout phonegap ;S
[12:24:39] <shoky> davidmahoney: i donno what yer doing there. make a jsfiddle if you want me to see if something should "work"
[12:25:07] <davidmahoney> all it is replacing a index in a string
[12:25:17] <davidmahoney> I don't know why this is getting complicated
[12:25:32] <davidmahoney> arrya[index] = 'whatever';
[12:25:33] <diamonds> $('&nbsp;')
[12:25:38] <diamonds> ^this throws
[12:25:39] <diamonds> why
[12:25:43] <diamonds> how avoid
[12:25:47] <shoky> davidmahoney: if its not complicated, reproduce it in a jsfiddle.
[12:26:10] <harpal> ctienrsg: I understand that code. but that will overlap image directly, I would like to overlap as per scrolling. so if you scroll few  then it will overlap few pixels like that.
[12:26:14] <diamonds> http://jsfiddle.net/LagAC/
[12:26:25] <citizen_stig> hi, how select all <li> without <a> inside it?
[12:30:17] <diamonds> http://jsfiddle.net/LagAC/
[12:30:40] <clov3r> citizen_stig: one way could be $('li').filter($('li a').parent('li'));
[12:30:46] <fikst> diamonds, what are you trying to do?
[12:31:07] <diamonds> fikst: http://jsfiddle.net/LagAC/
[12:31:09] <diamonds> sorry
[12:31:17] <diamonds> if($(selectedHTML).not('ul,li').html() !== null)
[12:31:31] <diamonds> something like this, test for if it's only uls & lis
[12:32:02] <fikst> so what are you doing with the &nbsp;?
[12:32:04] <BillCriswell> citizen_stig: $('li:not(:has(a))') as also work.
[12:32:05] <ctienrsg> citizen_stig: can you post the entire li  thing?
[12:32:24] <diamonds> fikst: if the document only contains an &nbsp; apparently
[12:32:27] <BillCriswell> Sounds like something right off a kitty website.
[12:32:29] <diamonds> it's content I hadn't anticipated
[12:32:57] <Assim_Work> this works in firefox, but not chrome: http://dot.aquaveo.com/index.php?q=sMap.php. Click on the bottom right button above the map labeld HY-8. It appears that in chrome the .click method used on lines 148 and 150 of smap.php don't trigger the change method on line 155? any adeas why, or is there a better approach I should use? it appears to be quite erratic on when it triggers appropriate methods and it doesn't from clicking around I'm having a hard t
[12:33:51] <citizen_stig> ctienrsg: yes, 5 seconds
[12:34:52] <ctienrsg> citizen_stig: you best try the ideas of clov3r, diamonds and BillCriswell first :)
[12:36:10] <citizen_stig> ctienrsg: http://pastebin.com/Nem3SDGb
[12:36:14] <citizen_stig> i'll try
[12:36:36] <diamonds_> fikst: I did not expect a document with only &nbsp;
[12:36:37] <ctienrsg> wait a second
[12:36:39] <diamonds_> fikst: thoughts?
[12:36:52] <ctienrsg> i think you make it too complicated, citizen_stig
[12:37:35] <fikst> diamonds, selectedHTML = '&nbsp;' ?
[12:38:07] <ctienrsg> $('#tours > li:odd') citizen_stig
[12:38:09] <ctienrsg> try this
[12:38:09] <shoky> diamonds_: maybe..  $( $.parseHTML(selectedHTML) ).not('ul,li')
[12:38:10] <citizen_stig> BillCriswell: looks like it works
[12:38:31] <clov3r> shocking :)
[12:39:12] <ctienrsg> I mean of course ul instead of #tours :o
[12:39:23] <shoky> diamonds_ tho i donno why you're doing .html() !== null
[12:40:05] <shoky> diamonds_ you probably want .length > 0  instead
[12:41:32] <jim_j> hi all
[12:42:20] <jim_j> I have 2 forms on a page, and I want to be able to fill out certain fields on the second form when 'email' is filled out and tab is pressed on the first firm.  what's the best way to catch that event and update the second form?
[12:43:35] <fikst> jim_j, you'll want the blur event
[12:43:47] <citizen_stig> one more, i have text, a want to <a href="text">text</a>, how to do it?
[12:44:02] <subanomic> hi
[12:44:15] <subanomic> can I somehow move DOM elements around in the DOM structure?
[12:44:33] <fikst> $('<a href="'+text+'">'+text+'</a>')
[12:44:35] <jim_j> fikst, cool, so blur event and then assign the value for the 2nd form via manual assignment?
[12:44:57] <fikst> jim_j, yes
[12:45:04] <jim_j> fikst, thanks!
[12:45:18] <fikst> subanomic, all function that end in To will move dom element
[12:45:22] <fikst> like appendTo()
[12:45:34] <subanomic> thanks
[12:45:43] <shoky> also many that don't end in To
[12:45:56] <subanomic> and that moves the element and its child elements?
[12:46:30] <shoky> subanomic: yes
[12:46:33] <fikst> yes
[12:48:47] <ctienrsg> subanomic: dont read, just practise for a few minutes. Here is a guy who explains you AppendTo: http://try.jquery.com/levels/3/sections/2
[12:48:51] <jim_j> fikst, this might also be possible in just straight html5?
[12:49:19] <NoiseEee> jim_j: no, javascript.
[12:49:31] <jim_j> ok
[12:55:10] <sorush20> Hi all
[12:55:13] <sorush20> how are you?
[12:56:02] <subanomic> thanks ctienrsg that was helpful
[12:56:36] <sorush20> I need to know where I can post a problem and get some guidance about working on a project that will involve jquery
[12:57:42] <BillCriswell> sorush20: Here's as good as any.
[12:58:29] <ctienrsg> sorush20: shit on this computer boards. create a jsfiddle and ask here, this is very good channel
[12:59:24] <rebel_yell> hey guys have any of you used tag-it?
[12:59:38] <rebel_yell> im trying to append a tag instead of replace it
[12:59:49] <rebel_yell> 						$('#user_dash_list').val($('#user_dash_list').val() + ' ,' + $(":input[name='item[tags][]']").map(function () { return $(this).val(); }).get() );
[12:59:55] <rebel_yell> this is the code i have so far
[13:00:00] <rebel_yell> but it grabs all tags inputted
[13:00:07] <rebel_yell> and adds them each time
[13:00:10] <rebel_yell> instead of once
[13:02:48] <BillCriswell> rebel_yell: You can do $input.val(function(idx, originalValue ){ return originalValue + someOtherShit });
[13:03:08] <rebel_yell> ok will try it out
[13:03:13] <rebel_yell> whats idx>
[13:03:16] <rebel_yell> idx*
[13:03:28] <BillCriswell> The index of the element if you have to update a few.
[13:05:15] <BillCriswell> What do you guys think makes more sense if you want to only show items with certain properties, "filter" or "limit" ?
[13:06:43] <BillCriswell> I see "filter' everywhere, but when I think of "filter" I assume "filter out".
[13:07:59] <shoky> i'd go with filter. but in certain contexts could go with other stuff... depends
[13:09:10] <BillCriswell> Zappos uses filter for mobile stuff, "Narrow Your Search"  on the desktop site though, which I like a lot.
[13:10:28] <BillCriswell> I love thinking of this stuff, but it eats up so much time haha.
[13:12:04] <rebel_yell> 						$('#user_dash_list').val(function(idx, originalValue ){ return originalValue + $(":input[name='item[tags][]']").map(function () { return $(this).val(); }).get() });
[13:12:08] <rebel_yell> still doesnt work
[13:12:21] <rebel_yell> it grabs the first tag and the second tag
[13:12:39] <BillCriswell> rebel_yell: .get().join(', ') ?
[13:13:15] <NoiseEee> rebel_yell: try breaking it up into more than a one-liner and see if it helps you
[13:13:35] <NoiseEee> rebel_yell: that kind of one-line code is total garbage from a readibilty/usability perspective.
[13:13:37] <rebel_yell> i think the problem is in the map
[13:13:49] <rebel_yell> it grabs the first tag the first time
[13:14:02] <rebel_yell> but if i write another tag it will add both the first and the second
[13:14:35] <BillCriswell> rebel_yell: You're returning a string + array.
[13:15:24] <rebel_yell> how do i get just the strinf
[13:15:31] <rebel_yell> 						$("#fake_dash_list").val($(":input[name='item[tags][]']").map(function () { return $(this).val(); }).get())
[13:15:33] <rebel_yell> with this one
[13:15:37] <rebel_yell> it just appends them
[13:15:43] <BillCriswell> .get().join(', ')
[13:16:06] <rebel_yell> but it deletes the original value
[13:16:15] <rebel_yell> so what i need in psuedo code is this
[13:16:37] <rebel_yell> $("#fake_dash_list").val( this val + tags that user is inputting)
[13:19:10] <BillCriswell> rebel_yell: Just like I showed earlier: http://jsbin.com/axeram/1/edit
[13:20:33] <davidmahoney> any google maps experts in here
[13:22:17] <rebel_yell> but i dont have tags like that
[13:22:39] <davidmahoney> jquery question oh boy
[13:22:41] <BillCriswell> It's just an array.
[13:22:55] <BillCriswell> $(":input[name='item[tags][]']").map(function () { return $(this).val(); }).get() returns an array
[13:23:02] <BillCriswell> So you need to do: $(":input[name='item[tags][]']").map(function () { return $(this).val(); }).get().join(', ')
[13:24:17] <jim_j> if I have two forms with the name 'register'  how do I only run a validate on the 2nd form?  jQuery("#register").validate({
[13:24:30] <rebel_yell> im getting this now
[13:24:31] <rebel_yell> [object HTMLInputElement]
[13:24:50] <davidmahoney> so I have a string it is < div class = "balh><span><img src>Change this text</span></div>
[13:24:57] <BillCriswell> jim_j: You should only have one with an id of register.
[13:25:05] <davidmahoney> is there a way to just change that text
[13:25:22] <BillCriswell> jQuery('form[name=register]').eq(1).validate({}); would get the secon one, though.
[13:25:24] <davidmahoney> like how jquery would use innerHTMl = blah
[13:25:34] <jim_j> billcriswell, thanks!
[13:25:52] <jim_j> billcriswell, yes it's less than ideal
[13:25:57] <davidmahoney> cause O want to leave everything else along just change that text
[13:26:25] <BillCriswell> davidmahoney: Would have to go through the .contents() and find the text node of span.
[13:27:15] <davidmahoney> BillCriswell but it is a string .content() ?
[13:27:16] <BillCriswell> davidmahoney: $(string).find('span') would get you to the span
[13:29:01] <davidmahoney> and what would it return
[13:29:59] <BillCriswell> it would return the span with the image and the text node.
[13:30:22] <rebel_yell> 						$('#user_dash_list').val(function(idx, originalValue ){ return originalValue + ', '+ $(":input[name='item[tags][]']").get() });
[13:30:38] <davidmahoney> so how would I change the text node
[13:30:42] <rebel_yell> getting that [object HTMLInputElement]
[13:31:16] <BillCriswell> rebel_yell: That's not what I showed you earlier. You want to use .map() like you were earlier.
[13:32:10] <rebel_yell> so .map
[13:32:15] <BillCriswell> davidmahoney: You'd have to go through the contents and filter it out.
[13:32:44] <rebel_yell> 						$('#user_dash_list').val(function(idx, originalValue ){ return originalValue + ', '+ $(":input[name='item[tags][]']").map(function () { return $(this).val(); }).get() });
[13:32:52] <rebel_yell> where would i put the join>
[13:32:56] <rebel_yell> after the get
[13:33:03] <BillCriswell> I showed you at least 4 times.
[13:33:22] <rebel_yell> sorry im slow :(
[13:33:30] <BillCriswell> davidmahoney: $el.contents.filter(function(){ return this.nodeType === 3; });
[13:34:05] <davidmahoney> el being the string?
[13:34:32] <BillCriswell> el would be the jquery object span
[13:34:47] <BillCriswell> davidmahoney: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9956388/how-to-change-only-text-node-in-element seems helpful.
[13:35:23] <BillCriswell> davidmahoney: If you could get that text node into a span it's much easier.
[13:36:00] <davidmahoney> bill I think I can
[13:36:24] <rebel_yell> BillCriswell: 						$('#user_dash_list').val(function(idx, originalValue ){ return originalValue + ', '+ $(":input[name='item[tags][]']").map(function () { return $(this).val(); }).get().join(', ') });
[13:36:30] <rebel_yell> like that>
[13:36:33] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[13:36:46] <rebel_yell> still does the double inputs
[13:36:59] <davidmahoney> actually no I can't
[13:37:05] <davidmahoney> I need the image in there
[13:37:20] <rebel_yell> so my tag is books
[13:37:24] <rebel_yell> if i write hockey
[13:37:27] <rebel_yell> and then lol
[13:37:29] <rebel_yell> my end result is
[13:37:30] <rebel_yell> books, hockey, hockey, lol
[13:37:31] <davidmahoney> looking at that link bill everything looks like it from a div or something not a string
[13:37:50] <BillCriswell> davidmahoney: I was only trying to get you the text node.
[13:37:58] <davidmahoney> that is all
[13:38:02] <davidmahoney> I want
[13:38:06] <davidmahoney> var n = $(newcontent).find('span');
[13:38:07] <davidmahoney>                                      $el.contents.filter(function(){ return this.nodeType === 3; });
[13:38:14] <davidmahoney> I know that is wronf
[13:38:16] <davidmahoney> *wrong
[13:40:01] <BillCriswell> davidmahoney: http://jsbin.com/exevuy/1/edit if you could get just the text in the span wrapped in another span.
[13:41:11] <wilkinsmc> feelin like a boss
[13:41:58] <BillCriswell> rebel_yell: I'd need to see more of your code somewhere online.
[13:42:52] <rebel_yell> https://github.com/aehlke/tag-it
[13:43:19] <davidmahoney> I need that image in there since it is in the same container
[13:43:47] <BillCriswell> davidmahoney: It can still be in there.
[13:43:53] <davidmahoney> this is the field <div class="bpci-avatar"><s></s><i></i><span> <img src ="' + thumbnail + '"width="100px" height="100px">Stop '+(index+1)+'</span></div>'
[13:43:54] <BillCriswell> rebel_yell: I don't have time to read through that documentation.
[13:44:19] <rebel_yell> kk
[13:44:21] <wilkinsmc> any idea why my on the click event my window.location = 'Home.html'; goes to 'index.html' instead?
[13:44:22] <rebel_yell> no worries
[13:44:24] <davidmahoney> when i put in the other span it made look all messed up
[13:44:56] <BillCriswell> wilkinsmc: Redirects I'd imagine.
[13:45:08] <davidmahoney> maybe there is a way to modify that to use a second spam
[13:45:15] <wilkinsmc> the path works on the first hmtl file i made
[13:45:23] <wilkinsmc> how do i override redirects?
[13:45:45] <wilkinsmc> i'm clicking on the same button on another page of the site and want it to go to the same place as on the other page
[13:45:56] <davidmahoney> BillCriswell: is there a way to modify that
[13:52:28] <BillCriswell> davidmahoney: http://jsbin.com/exevuy/2/edit this works, but it's ugly as hell and maybe the only way with the markup like that.
[13:53:12] <TrentonDAdams> jQuery('#courseIndex-0').focus() does nothing in firefox for windows, but works in firefox for linux.
[13:53:14] <TrentonDAdams> Any ideas?
[13:53:48] <BillCriswell> TrentonDAdams: Try giving it a tabindex="-1" or something.
[13:55:49] <delinquentme> global vars.
[13:55:53] <delinquentme> window.varName?
[13:56:04] <delinquentme> im not getting access where I think I should be. tis the ish-shoe
[13:56:29] <TrentonDAdams> The tabindex doesn't work either, already been trying that. :(
[13:56:47] <TrentonDAdams> It must be some funky stuff happening in the browser, I'll keep looking at it.
[13:57:01] <BillCriswell> TrentonDAdams: What kind of element is it?
[13:57:56] <davidmahoney> billCriswell that didn't work
[13:58:08] <BillCriswell> I sent you a working example.
[13:59:32] <davidmahoney> Bill Criswell  I got it working
[13:59:39] <BillCriswell> Awesome.
[13:59:51] <davidmahoney> I have question why do we need to put the string in $()
[14:00:45] <BillCriswell> You can't do anything to it besides string functions if it's just a string.
[14:01:13] <davidmahoney> that was probably where I was going wrong before
[14:01:27] <davidmahoney> there is some much stuff I still have to learn about web dev
[14:01:59] <BillCriswell> davidmahoney: It's fun when the problems are challenging.
[14:04:58] <BillCriswell> Not so much when it's just a pain in the ass for no good reason, like your issue haha.
[14:05:25] <TrentonDAdams> BillCriswell: It's just a regular radio button
[14:05:39] <BillCriswell> TrentonDAdams: Ah.
[14:07:37] <BillCriswell> TrentonDAdams: http://jsbin.com/irecig/1/edit does this plain example work? Don't have windows to test on.
[14:16:58] <glaksmono> anyone is around?
[14:17:02] <glaksmono> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/ <-- why is this not recommended?
[14:18:08] <thomedy> im writing a jquery plugin... that is only for my portfolio it serves no function as its purpose has already been accomplished
[14:18:11] <thomedy> but...
[14:18:23] <thomedy> www.thinkrium.com/samples/customjqueryplugin
[14:18:40] <thomedy> why isn't clientX - this.offsetLeft giving me the correct  canvas position
[14:18:48] <thomedy> or cursor position in the canvas
[14:19:29] <cwatson_> ##jquery
[14:19:43] <cwatson_> oops, sorry
[14:21:22] <NoiseEee> glaksmono: uh, read the note?
[14:24:06] <TrentonDAdams> BillCriswell: No sir, that example does not work on firefox in windows, but does on linux
[14:24:37] <sunya7a> hi...could someone tell me which of these two is faster and why please? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5505576
[14:25:28] <TrentonDAdams> BillCriswell: I am referring to http://jsbin.com/irecig/1/edit
[14:26:16] <TrentonDAdams> BillCriswell: Doesn't work on IE either.
[14:26:22] <BillCriswell> Sucks.
[14:26:41] <NoiseEee> $('input:radio')[0].focus();
[14:26:48] <TrentonDAdams> Maybe I should quit web development?  After 10 years, stuff like that still pisses me off
[14:27:03] <TrentonDAdams> damn browser
[14:27:49] <TrentonDAdams> NoiseEee: that one works.
[14:28:07] <TrentonDAdams> But then, why won't an ID based jquery lookup work?
[14:28:14] <NoiseEee> TrentonDAdams: yeah keep it simple with natural JS.  .trigger() is used for events, no?
[14:28:52] <NoiseEee> TrentonDAdams: because [0] returns the actual DOM element with all its natural JS methods waiting to be used. without it, you're actually operating on the jquery object/collection
[14:29:24] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Think it's worthy of a bug report?
[14:29:47] <TrentonDAdams> Oh, interesting.
[14:30:09] <kaajo> Can anyone see why the CSS animation doesn't work when the red box disappears here http://codepen.io/sushimashi/pen/CIKpl
[14:40:51] <TrentonDAdams> BillCriswell: document.getElementById().focus(); also fails on firefox on windows but succeeds in linux
[14:41:31] <TrentonDAdams> BillCriswell: but works on IE
[14:41:35] <TrentonDAdams> lol, browser suck

[14:42:47] <norbert_> hi all, I'm using jquery's $.ajax (type POST), and it works in all browsers except IE (no matter which version)
[14:43:01] <raj> I'm trying to load a website with $.ajax({dataType:'html'})  but I get 'XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://www.somesite.com/' in the browser console
[14:43:05] <norbert_> is this a know issue, maybe someone here ran into this at some point and knows a fix/workaround?
[14:43:20] <adac> I'm doing an ajax request like this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5505688 but the "text" is not correctly submitted it is cut off. Do I have to set a special encoding?
[14:43:31] <raj> 'Origin mysite.net is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin
[14:43:33] <raj> '
[14:44:26] <kaajo> No one can help me with this http://mibbit.com/

[14:44:54] <kaajo> I need slide out animation via CSS but not working
[14:49:39] <raj> oh, i can't cross site
[15:04:17] <workmeh> it should be possible to make an SPA with JQM right?
[15:17:00] <Max-P> Hi, I have problem adding HTML5 elements through jquery in IE8. I'm trying to emulate the <template> tag on IE8, by just hidding them. <template>s added directly in the source works ok with html5shiv, but those added with jquery are completely messed up. Any idea?
[15:24:32] <PatrickMello> masters, have any way to open an modal in some function, and block the execution of this until modal is closed??
[15:25:07] <pachet> the execution of what now
[15:25:37] <pachet> Max-P: you have to declare unknown elements upfront so IE8 doesn't choke on them
[15:26:07] <pachet> ?g whatwg supporting new elements
[15:26:08] <b-ot> pachet: The WHATWG Blog â€” Supporting New Elements in IE â†’ http://blog.whatwg.org/supporting-new-elements-in-ie
[15:26:54] <PatrickMello> I have a callback from jquery file upload plugin.. this plugin have a formData callback.. I think about to open a bootstraop modal with some input values and wait to close this modal to return the formData values ...
[15:27:16] <PatrickMello> to continue with upload
[15:29:32] <Max-P> pachet, Yes, I have document.createElement('template'); on the top of my <head>. Those already in the page are fine, but those created by jQuery (like $('body').append($('<template>Im supposed to be hidden'));) are handled like the createElement trick never existed
[15:30:12] <pachet> are you sure the content is well formed otherwise
[15:30:21] <raj> How do I search an array of associative array objects for a string that may be within another string?
[15:30:46] <pachet> loop over them
[15:31:16] <raj> pachet, it's actually json
[15:31:20] <raj> is there not a faster way?
[15:31:26] <Max-P> pachet, Yes it is. I tried basically just the example I wrote, it is definitely well formed. It works on any browsers, except IE8. Even IE9 does it right
[15:31:29] <raj> then manually checking each k/v pair?
[15:32:00] <pachet> you could just regexp search the json string
[15:32:18] <pachet> but that would depend on your use case, whether you could make the assumptions necessary
[15:32:23] <Max-P> raj, If you have the json string, just use the .match() function of the property. But converting it from object to json string then check will be slower than looping all over it yourself
[15:32:55] <Max-P> raj: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match
[15:37:39] <raj> Max-P, I have access to a .json file
[15:37:56] <ribot> hi
[15:38:54] <Max-P> raj, Then use .match on the string, it's definitely the fastest way.
[15:42:49] <raj> Max-P, so once I find the string, how can I search for a different key within that object?
[15:43:09] <raj> (again, that object is one of many in an array)
[15:45:33] <Max-P> raj, So you need to find a key, but then you have to process what's inside that key?
[15:45:58] <Max-P> Then the only solution is to load it as an object and loop all over it recursively
[15:46:36] <raj> hmm ok
[15:47:06] <raj> Max-P, would it be faster to find the nearest { and }  in the string and get what's in btwn
[15:47:10] <raj> and then turn that into an object
[15:47:36] <raj> actually, it's not that big of a deal
[15:47:45] <raj> I'll just turn the whole thing into an object
[15:48:12] <Max-P> raj, it depends on the size of the object
[15:48:52] <Max-P> if you are processing a 30 Mb file full of data and only need a few bytes into it, yeah, finding the nearest {} is definitely faster
[15:49:50] <Max-P> If the file is somehow small (less than a megabyte or so), the extra work to find the tags, extract that AND parse it into an objet afterward probably isn't worth it
[15:50:06] <raj> I agree
[15:50:08] <raj> thanks for the talk :)
[15:50:51] <Max-P> And I'd question your design if you search in such a big file. Because searching the {} will take as much if not more time than just building the object, so it's usually not worth it at all
[15:51:11] <Max-P> parsing a JSON string = native code
[15:51:38] <Max-P> parsing it yourself = some virtual machine AND calling the JSON parser anyway after
[15:52:13] <Max-P> Even with all the optimizations in modern Javascript VMs, native code is still way faster
[15:54:31] <PeterBoy> I need help in implementing something
[15:54:41] <PeterBoy> http://jsfiddle.net/cc48t/
[15:54:49] <PeterBoy> Do I just copy paste that javascript into a file?
[15:55:31] <Max-P> PeterBoy, The answer to this question will always be "No!"
[15:55:43] <Max-P> Try to understand what you are doing first
[15:56:31] <Max-P> Yes you can copy and paste it. But make sure to change the relevant parts of it
[15:56:35] <PeterBoy> I know what it does.
[15:57:51] <raj> Max-P, how can I load a .json file from a website?
[15:58:40] <Max-P> raj, $.get
[15:58:50] <Max-P> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[16:00:03] <raj> it's not $.ajax({url:'http://someplace.com',dataType:'json'})} ?
[16:00:15] <raj> except with correct parens
[16:06:16] <PeterBoy> So how do I implement that javascript?
[16:10:20] <PeterBoy> I put the javascript inside a document ready function but it doesn't work. Do I have to have those css properties?
[16:15:11] <aeos> Hi, I am using datepicker with the onShowDay limiting the number of days shown, but when I select a day that is valid, the selected date style is not displayed. What might I be doing wrong?

[16:33:34] <delinquentme> naming conventions when talking about variables vrs functions
[16:33:44] <delinquentme> variables are..... ____ functions are ...... __________
[16:37:27] <raj> delinquentme, functions are sequences of instructions

[16:38:31] <raj> oh, btwn vars and functions?
[16:38:34] <raj> i think they're pretty similar
[16:38:38] <raj> they camelCase in js
[16:38:47] <delinquentme> so what are underscored in JS?
[16:39:20] <raj> I underscore as a greater separator than camelCase, if that makes sense
[16:39:30] <raj> I may use both in the same name
[16:40:10] <delinquentme> ....
[16:40:49] <delinquentme> my biome says thats bad practice no?

[17:27:21] <chrisTech> I've manage to make an image transtion smoothly from scrollable to fixed when user scrolls downward. The problem is when viewed from a Mac Chrome (latest version), it moves horizontally. What could I be doing wrong? Anyone? :)

[17:31:07] <chrisTech> Here's my code: http://pastebin.com/5vkqt6bg
[17:35:18] <raj> what's wrong with http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/p3EP6/ ?
[17:35:57] <shoky> raj: that site is not responding with jsonp
[17:36:10] <shoky> server needs to support jsonp for it to work
[17:36:18] <raj> yooo shoky
[17:36:19] <raj> :)
[17:36:27] <shoky> ey ;p
[17:36:30] <raj> shoky, what's with the syntax error?
[17:36:53] <shoky> raj: that's from trying to parse JSON as javascript code
[17:37:05] <raj> I am?
[17:37:09] <raj> where?
[17:37:13] <shoky> js> {"hey":"lol"}
[17:37:15] <b-ot> shoky: No output.
[17:37:39] <raj> and `data` is json?
[17:37:44] <raj> oh right
[17:37:48] <shoky> raj: that's what JSONP is, it's javascript. by setting dataType: 'jsonp' you're telling jquery to execute the response as javascript
[17:37:53] <shoky> well
[17:38:02] <shoky> not really, you're adding a <script> tag
[17:38:18] <raj> so shoky, why doesn't http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/p3EP6/1/ work?
[17:38:37] <shoky> raj: because of same-origin policy
[17:38:49] <raj> but I have crossDomain:true
[17:39:15] <shoky> raj: there is no way around SOP if the server doesn't support it. that's the point
[17:39:34] <raj> I see
[17:39:40] <raj> so i can't download a json file from a site
[17:39:57] <shoky> worst case, you can make a proxy on your own server
[17:40:14] <raj> serverside I do'nt have an issue
[17:40:19] <raj> I can access it from there
[17:40:24] <shoky> exactly
[17:40:26] <raj> but I was trying to do it in js on the fly
[17:40:39] <raj> without needing a call to my server
[17:41:10] <shoky> you can't, unless the server supports it
[17:42:34] <boytoy> Trying to hide my dropdown menu when clicking outside it (like in Gmail) -- anybody know what I'm doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/ndqKj/
[17:42:49] <raj> damn
[17:43:29] <boytoy> raj: what? u dissing my design homeboy?
[17:43:32] <boytoy> :p
[17:44:44] <lenswipee> hi peeps
[17:48:06] <coldhead> you again
[17:48:10] <coldhead> this keeps happening
[17:48:30] <shoky> boytoy: which of them should it close if they're both open..?
[17:49:05] <boytoy> shoky: good question i never really thought of that
[17:49:24] <boytoy> shoky: the last one that opened? sounds like a longshot though
[17:49:41] <shoky> boytoy: when you figure out what you want, ask again ;P
[17:50:42] <boytoy> shoky: my bad, only one menu should be open at a time
[17:52:28] <boytoy> So for what it's worth: How do I hide my dropdown menu when clicking outside it, and also make sure only one menu is open at a time? http://jsfiddle.net/ndqKj/
[17:52:48] <lenswipee> coldhead: and hello to you too :)
[17:54:04] <boytoy> lenswipee: you two know each other?
[17:54:31] <lenswipee> boytoy: only on #jquery
[17:54:50] <boytoy> ah ok
[17:57:06] <coldhead> that's enough
[17:59:10] <shoky> boytoy: here's one way.. prolly not the nicest http://jsfiddle.net/ndqKj/1/
[17:59:39] <lenswipee> hi, how much validation on client-side is really needed? is simply checking if fields aren't empty sufficient?
[18:00:39] <boytoy> shoky: really cool thanks a lot man
[18:00:50] <boytoy> it's for my niese's birthday party
[18:01:19] <boytoy> gonna add some balloons, couple of unicorns, maybe some gold glittering stars and im done
[18:04:03] <boytoy> shoky: cool it doesnt even use that plugin
[18:09:38] <coldhead> niece*
[18:10:18] <dylanm312> hello?
[18:10:22] <raj> hi
[18:10:36] <dylanm312> I can't seem to get the jQuery library to load
[18:10:46] <raj> what do you have so far?
[18:11:05] <dylanm312> I'm linking to Google's hosted libraries like so: <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.9.2/jquery-ui.min.js"></script>
[18:11:18] <raj> and what's it saying?
[18:11:27] <abjorn> mm pizza
[18:11:28] <raj> jquery-ui  isn't jquery, fwiw
[18:11:36] <dylanm312> No errors. It just doesn't work. I put this in my script.js file to test:
[18:11:37] <boytoy> coldhead: ah yeah
[18:11:37] <dylanm312> window.onload = function() {     alert("JavaScript works"); };   $(function() {     alert("jQuery works"); });
[18:11:47] <dylanm312> The JS test works, but not the jquery one
[18:11:57] <raj> dylanm312, you've loaded jquery-ui, but not jquery
[18:12:08] <boytoy> always trying to make a better man outta me :P
[18:12:16] <boytoy> like they say behind every strong man is a strong woman
[18:12:18] <raj> load jquery before jquery-ui
[18:12:22] <dylanm312> oh right! lemme fix that and let's see what happens
[18:12:36] <lenswipee> boytoy: it's stronger woman
[18:12:37] <raj> you don't even need jquery-ui possibly
[18:12:58] <lenswipee> boytoy: or stronger toywoman
[18:13:22] <dylanm312> ok I changed it to load jquery and it still doesn't work
[18:13:30] <boytoy> hehe
[18:13:46] <boytoy> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=toywoman nah it's not defined yet
[18:14:01] <boytoy> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=boytoy is though
[18:14:13] <coldhead> ?ud boytoy
[18:14:13] <b-ot> coldhead: boytoy: A guy friend that you have simply for the purpose of:    a)his company   b)sex    Boytoys are useful for making you feel sexy after your boyfriend breaks up with you. Similar to a booty call except the girl knows its not gonna go anywhere. (; â€” Man, am I tired, my boytoy came over last night...
[18:14:16] <raj> dylanm312, show me some code brotha
[18:14:25] <dylanm312> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
[18:14:33] <dylanm312> window.onload = function() {     alert("JavaScript works"); };   $(function() {     alert("jQuery works"); });
[18:15:10] <raj> try http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js
[18:15:41] <dylanm312> still nothing
[18:15:48] <raj> do you have a live site?
[18:15:49] <madprops> any trick to make a div (context menu) appear always inside the viewable window, so if it is opened near the bottom it is not chopped off?
[18:16:02] <dylanm312> yup, the site is up at http://parkmors.com
[18:16:16] <dylanm312> fyi, my last name isn't actually ParkMors, it's an inside joke
[18:17:00] <raj> not that inside, it says where the name comes from on the first page
[18:17:25] <dylanm312> oh right forgot about that hehe
[18:17:27] <dylanm312> :/
[18:17:41] <dylanm312> it's a work in progress
[18:18:05] <raj> dylanm312, try jquery 1.9
[18:18:15] <raj> oh
[18:18:16] <raj> nm
[18:18:18] <raj> i see the issue
[18:18:27] <raj> you're testing to see if jquery is loaded before loading jquery

[18:24:02] <coldhead> not cool, raj
[18:24:11] <coldhead> #jQuery has many women, leave them in peace
[18:25:08] <shoky> boytoy: because .find('ul') finds all of them
[18:26:13] <shoky> boytoy: maybe you meant .closest('li').find('ul').show()
[18:27:35] <boytoy> ah yeeeeeah
[18:27:44] <boytoy> aha-aha-ah yeeeeah
[18:27:54] <boytoy> scratch master vinyl, thank u bruv

[18:33:49] <boytoy> lenswipee: oh for sure
[18:34:34] <lenswipee> what party?
[18:34:56] <coldhead> if you have to ask you'll never know
[18:35:05] <coldhead> it's like the innermost secret of freemasonry
[18:38:36] <boytoy> lenswipee: gonna have this gathering at some tropical beach resort not too long from now ;)
[18:39:28] <boytoy> free food, free booze and free weed with an even male-to-female ratio
[18:39:37] <boytoy> good music
[18:39:43] <boytoy> and that fresh tropical breeze ;)
[18:40:01] <boytoy> there's a fund too apparently for those who aren't fortunate enough to pay for their own plane tickets
[18:40:15] <lenswipee> ah ha
[18:40:44] <lenswipee> sounds like it's really going to happen.
[18:41:01] <boytoy> no doubt
[18:41:04] <boytoy> stick around to find out when
[18:41:26] <lenswipee> you forgot to mention the private jet when naked women on board
[18:42:02] <boytoy> i dunno about that
[18:42:41] <boytoy> lenswipee: there's a lot of very rich people in this channel who owe most of their fortune to the help the received in here
[18:42:57] <boytoy> from what i know, they're the ones eager to see this thing happen
[18:43:08] <boytoy> * they received in here
[18:43:43] <lenswipee> How do I get invited on the 'free plane ticket' list?
[18:44:10] <lenswipee> memo to ops, please add me to this so called party.
[18:45:59] <relipse>  i've got a webpage when it shows up in my iphone it shows like half the page white and the other half small text, is there a way to start the webpage zoomed in?
[18:46:52] <boytoy> relipse: u mean like <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">?
[18:47:03] <relipse> that might work
[18:47:04] <relipse> thanks
[18:47:09] <boytoy> kewl
[18:47:29] <boytoy> relipse: hey dont forget https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll too
[18:49:20] <relipse> omgosh you rock!
[18:49:25] <relipse> it looks great now!
[18:49:30] <relipse> just gotta fix some minor issues
[18:59:01] <ddlk> My CORS AJAX with custorm header always got cancelled, (using jquery), anyidea?
[19:00:04] <shoky> you're always cancelling it?
[19:00:15] <shoky> that's my idea, anyways.
[19:01:07] <ddlk> If the ajax was made without any custom header, then every thing is OK
[19:01:47] <ddlk> but if there is a custom header, the preflight will be cancelled, I cannot tell it's by the browser or jquery
[19:07:20] <vita> hello
[19:07:36] <vita> i'm a newcomer
[19:07:45] <coldhead> vita: it's my first day using jquery
[19:07:47] <coldhead> welcome
[19:09:07] <coldhead> rabbit or habit
[19:09:19] <vita> habit
[19:09:55] <vita> i'm not  familiar with English
[19:12:33] <vita> Jquery members use this to connect?
[19:16:40] <vita> anybody here?
[19:17:09] <vita> help~
[19:21:56] <coldhead> yes vita
[19:22:05] <coldhead> just ask your question and someone will help you
[19:22:33] <vita> are you a contributer for jquery?
[19:22:41] <coldhead> no
[19:22:48] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[19:23:06] <voidpirate> nice! do you know JS?
[19:23:29] <coldhead> a little bit
[19:23:32] <coldhead> i know alert
[19:23:36] <coldhead> and while
[19:23:43] <coldhead> not for or closures
[19:23:48] <coldhead> not very well
[19:23:53] <voidpirate> what are closures?
[19:24:02] <voidpirate> I have not learned about them yet
[19:24:04] <coldhead> something to do with scope and privacy
[19:24:13] <coldhead> they're probably not important
[19:24:24] <vita> i learn for two month
[19:24:28] <vita> i like it
[19:24:42] <voidpirate> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Closures
[19:24:44] <coldhead> \o/
[19:24:54] <vita> and i want attend in the community
[19:25:02] <coldhead> thanks voidpirate i will read this
[19:25:12] <voidpirate> np
[19:25:21] <voidpirate> how is jquery going for you?
[19:26:21] <coldhead> it's nice, i like the css selectors and chaining
[19:26:57] <voidpirate> quite nice indeed, you reading a book?
[19:27:01] <abjorn> da qweries, runnin thru mah mind
[19:27:47] <coldhead> just tutorials and source code
[19:27:59] <vita> i uaually read the api
[19:28:38] <vita> how can i contrabute to the jQuery
[19:28:41] <voidpirate> you should check out the source :)
[19:28:49] <voidpirate> you can fork the project on Github
[19:29:04] <coldhead> vita: http://docs.jquery.com/Getting_Involved
[19:29:08] <coldhead> https://github.com/jquery/jquery
[19:29:11] <voidpirate> http://contribute.jquery.org/
[19:29:15] <vita> tks~
[19:29:57] <voidpirate> jquery is pretty easy to pick up
[19:30:21] <vita> you mean I should read the jQuery source code?
[19:30:21] <voidpirate> IMO I would learn the vanilla JS first
[19:32:08] <voidpirate> I always try to figure out why jquery works the way it does, and it helps alot
[19:33:10] <vita> how long do you use jQuery?
[19:34:34] <voidpirate> 2 years
[19:34:47] <voidpirate> JavaScript for almost 6
[19:35:36] <coldhead> i would hate JS without jQuery
[19:35:47] <coldhead> at least for DOM stuff
[19:35:51] <vita> Are you a member of jquery?
[19:36:04] <voidpirate> jQuery is just a library of JS
[19:36:11] <voidpirate> I am not
[19:36:59] <vita> do you have gtalk?
[19:36:59] <voidpirate> are you familiar with GitHub?
[19:37:08] <vita> yes~
[19:37:09] <voidpirate> never use it
[19:38:22] <vita> where are you from?
[19:39:13] <voidpirate> California
[19:39:23] <vita> China~
[19:39:35] <voidpirate> Your from Corvallis, OR, USA?
[19:40:18] <voidpirate> nevermind that is just the server we are on
[19:40:32] <vita> I want to attend to a foreign  open source comnity to learn
[19:40:58] <voidpirate> GitHub is a great learning resource, along with a book
[19:41:47] <vita> can i follow you on github?
[19:41:59] <voidpirate> sure if you can find me ;)
[19:42:13] <vita> read code on github?
[19:42:50] <abjorn> https://github.com/voidpirate ???!????
[19:43:19] <voidpirate> bingo!
[19:43:28] <abjorn> took me ages
[19:43:30] <vita> OK! I follwed you~
[19:43:35] <voidpirate> i know right :)
[19:44:01] <voidpirate> vita: cool
[19:44:24] <vita> html5-boilerplate is yours?
[19:44:33] <voidpirate> only forked
[19:45:25] <voidpirate> I fork and then delete stuff a lot
[19:46:16] <vita> do u have your repo?
[19:46:25] <voidpirate> ?
[19:47:09] <vita> repository
[19:47:17] <voidpirate> yes of what?
[19:47:50] <lenswipee> is the object returned by jQuery called the 'jQuery DOM object'?
[19:48:06] <vita> do you have the  repository written by yourself
[19:48:29] <voidpirate> I do have projects that I have written, but they are not open source
[19:49:33] <voidpirate> lenswipee: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1302428/what-does-jquery-actually-return
[19:49:42] <vita> yeah~    i will go to eat noon,  see you then~
[19:49:55] <lenswipee> voidpirate: just need to know the official name.
[19:50:44] <voidpirate> it just returns a jQuery object
[20:05:02] <graphettion> Sup folks?
[20:08:01] <voidpirate> graphettion: Hello
[20:15:09] <voidpirate> doesn't anyone write testing for jquery?
[20:15:17] <snover> what do you mean?
[20:16:34] <voidpirate> like a given set of requirements code should meet
[20:16:50] <voidpirate> I don't think it is needed though
[20:21:21] <lenswipee> what kind of requirements?
[20:23:27] <snover> that is the most ambiguous statement ever
[20:23:30] <snover> a set of requirements
[20:23:31] <snover> you mean like
[20:23:32] <snover> the unit tests
[20:23:34] <snover> and the coding conventions
[20:23:36] <snover> that already exist?
[20:30:33] <voidpirate> I know that is what I relized
[20:30:44] <voidpirate> sorry, carry on
[20:38:24] <relipse> http://goo.gl/rYzQU <-- watch this hidden camera interview
[21:02:38] <lenswipee> hi, does .find() look upstream and downstream of Document?
[21:02:54] <Cork> it searches through children
[21:03:05] <Cork> closest is for partents
[21:03:12] <Cork> `api find
[21:03:12] <b-ot> Cork: .find(): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[21:03:15] <Cork> `api closest
[21:03:17] <b-ot> Cork: .closest(): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[21:09:10] <lenswipee> Cork: ok
[21:09:45] <Gazpacho> wait so .closest doesn't do siblings and cousins?
[21:10:30] <Gazpacho> oh nm, i get it
[21:12:00] <Gazpacho> I hope someday I get a chance to read the code in jQuery that eliminates duplicates
[21:12:20] <voidpirate> why can't you?
[21:13:14] <Gazpacho> priorites
[21:14:56] <voidpirate> I hate those
[21:20:13] <lenswipee> `api dialogue
[21:20:13] <b-ot> lenswipee: No matches.
[21:20:16] <lenswipee> `api dialog
[21:20:18] <b-ot> lenswipee: No matches.
[21:20:24] <lenswipee> `api ui-dialog
[21:20:24] <b-ot> lenswipee: No matches.
[21:20:26] <Cork> Gazpacho: it's a simple for where new_array.push(elm1) $(elm1, new_array) == -1
[21:20:42] <Cork> ?g jquery dialog
[21:20:42] <b-ot> Cork: Dialog | jQuery UI â†’ http://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[21:21:13] <lenswipee> nothing works for me
[21:21:47] <Cork> Gazpacho: but it's only needed when it's a selection on multiple sources
[21:21:53] <Gazpacho> cork: didn't anyone ever tell you about spoilers?
[21:21:54] <Cork> like $('a').find()
[21:21:59] <Cork> :D
[21:23:10] <Cork> Gazpacho: actually i take that back
[21:23:16] <Cork> it has been rewritten now days
[21:24:05] <Cork> so it's handled directly by sizzle now
[21:27:08] <Cork> wtf
[21:30:03] <Z3R0> yo
[21:35:28] <Cork> ah, it's converting it to an array
[21:44:04] <Cork> Gazpacho: it has moved a bit but https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/master/sizzle.js#L755
[21:44:36] <Cork> so it's actually not jquery doing it anymore
[21:45:41] <relipse> in a select.change(function(){ }); how do i get the selected option's value and text?
[21:46:43] <Cork> var val = $(this).val() and $(this).find('option[value="' + val + '"]')
[21:47:21] <Cork> or $(this).find('option').filter(function() { return this.value == val; }) if you prefer that
[21:56:57] <relipse> how do i disable a submit button?
[21:57:25] <coldhead> $(':submit').attribute('disabled', 'disabled')
[21:57:44] <relipse> what does :submit do?
[21:58:00] <coldhead> ?:submit
[21:58:11] <darkc0de> Hi guys. Help please - http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/6yPgz/2/ <- how can i put a go back link so that the next  dialog box will go back to the previous dialog box. is it possible?

[22:15:39] <iaj> If theres an a tag, tahts starting with "My" .. would you guys hardcode a <span> around it to give it a certain color or would you do that via jQuery somehow?
[22:16:01] <coldhead> that's a dilly of a pickle
[22:16:08] <iaj> eg... I have a <a ...>My Account</a> and I want to have the "My" in a different color
[22:16:30] <iaj> but for 3 My's all together... dont think there will be more :D
[22:16:47] <ryanneufeld> iaj: use a span
[22:16:50] <coldhead> you need a span
[22:16:57] <ryanneufeld> CLOD!!!
[22:16:58] <coldhead> whether you do it in the HTML or add it with jQuery
[22:17:02] <ryanneufeld> long time to see buddy
[22:17:04] <coldhead> is what my sister calls "a matter for yourself"
[22:17:10] <iaj> ALright, thanks :)
[22:17:12] <iaj> Buddies.
[22:17:16] <coldhead> where you been all my life, ryanneufeld
[22:17:23] <ryanneufeld> Watching you
[22:17:25] <ryanneufeld> from afar
[22:17:30] <coldhead> oh god
[22:17:39] <ryanneufeld> I hear that a lot
[22:17:40] <coldhead> for what happened in the bathroom this morning
[22:17:42] <coldhead> please understand
[22:17:46] <coldhead> it was a misunderstanding
[22:17:48] <ryanneufeld> shhh
[22:17:48] <ryanneufeld> shhh
[22:17:52] <ryanneufeld> it's okay
[22:17:52] <coldhead> I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS HER HAIR
[22:18:05] <ryanneufeld> WHAT DID YOU THINK IT WAS?
[22:18:10] <coldhead> i thought it was mine
[22:18:16] <ryanneufeld> oh
[22:18:20] <ryanneufeld> that explains it then
[22:18:20] <coldhead> you have to agree that would make more sense
[22:18:23] <ryanneufeld> honest mistake
[22:18:26] <coldhead> if it were mine
[22:18:28] <coldhead> i know i know
[22:18:31] <coldhead> but it looked bad
[22:18:32] <ryanneufeld> happens all the time
[22:18:35] <coldhead> hours to clean
[22:18:37] <ryanneufeld> happened to me last week
[22:18:38] <coldhead> and i just left it
[22:18:42] <coldhead> ran down the fire escape
[22:18:55] <coldhead> i can't ever go back
[22:19:05] <ryanneufeld> I actually pulled the fire alarm to disguise a fart
[22:19:34] <ryanneufeld> looking back on it now, totally worth it
[22:19:37] <ryanneufeld> no one noticed
[22:19:46] <ryanneufeld> on that note
[22:19:48] <ryanneufeld> good night
[22:20:43] <coldhead> lovely to catch up, ryanneufeld
[22:20:47] <coldhead> and again: sorry
[22:22:01] <coldhead> there's a light in the wings hits a system of strings from the side while they swing; see the wires, the wires, the wires
[22:32:50] <coldhead> slayer's guitarist is dead?
[22:33:18] <tw2113> yup
[22:33:21] <coldhead> of a spider bite?
[22:33:25] <coldhead> that is SO METAL \m/
[22:33:47] <tw2113> i did a drastic thing last night coldhead
[22:33:54] <tw2113> you're the first person i'm going to tell
[22:33:57] <coldhead> wassat
[22:34:05] <tw2113> i took #html5 off my autojoin list for IRC
[22:34:19] <coldhead> woah
[22:34:27] <coldhead> you think html5 is dead?
[22:34:31] <coldhead> you're going back to xhtml?
[22:34:40] <tw2113> no
[22:34:50] <coldhead> you just hate those guys?
[22:34:59] <tw2113> mostly just an excessive tab that only shows people asking about semantics and questions they thing are html5 related
[22:35:23] <tw2113> overhype has people thinking anything js related is html5
[22:35:47] <tw2113> don't worry, #jQuery is still autojoined
[22:36:16] <therrell> Any jQuery.Masonry's users in here? If so, I'm wondering if anyone didn't like it's overlayed brick action on appended method before placement and found a solution.
[22:36:47] <Cork> tw2113: well not that strange as "html5" is marketing
[22:37:00] <Cork> so you will get a lot of buzz there
[22:37:03] <Cork> but not much else
[22:37:23] <tw2113> strangely enough, i can tolerate people asking general js questions in here
[22:37:38] <coldhead> i can't tolerate anything, especially latex or dairy
[22:37:59] <Cork> tw2113: well html5 is html, css, js, jquery, ajax, and things built on that like weblg and...
[22:38:12] <Cork> it's a kinda broad topic :)
[22:38:21] <tw2113> no kitchen sink?
[22:38:26] <tw2113> #specFAIL
[22:38:28] <coldhead> it's also that natty logo
[22:38:40] <Cork> tw2113: the spec is "html" not "html5"
[22:38:51] <tw2113> oh yeah
[22:39:02] <Cork> html5 is buzz html is the standard
[22:39:24] * therrell watches his question wash out into the sea...
[22:39:24] <ravenzz> no!?
[22:40:21] <wad3g> hola
[22:41:11] <ravenzz> html5 is candidate recommendation
[22:41:54] <Cork> ravenzz: the browsers implements the html live standard
[22:42:15] <Cork> w3c pushed for going html5, but the browsers won't do another revision
[22:42:47] <coldhead> lousy browsers
[22:43:30] <graphettion> I can't get the previous button to work! - http://jsfiddle.net/AxURN/20/
[22:43:38] <graphettion> Ugh!
[22:44:22] <Cork> ravenzz: this is what browsers implement http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/
[22:44:48] <ravenzz> Cork yeah, however the W3C has been working at extensions which can be implemented by UAs
[22:45:04] <Cork> ravenzz: thats kinda the other way around
[22:45:19] <Cork> whatwg has a live standard
[22:45:25] <Cork> it adds new things over time
[22:45:37] <Cork> but as w3c want a fixed set they need to have extensions
[22:46:46] <wad3g> Is anyone in here familiar with the CMS MojoPortal?
[22:46:47] <ravenzz> yah that's a good way to go I think
[22:47:13] <ravenzz> wad3g I am not, you should ask #web :)
[22:47:43] <Cork> ravenzz: basically whatwg live html gets a new set of features when more then 50% of the render agents support it
[22:47:44] <wad3g> I actually just asked in #web, it doesn't appear so
[22:48:04] <Cork> while w3c wants to set what features the browser should support
[22:48:20] <wad3g> My question is actually more of a web development question anyway, rather than a CMS question.
[22:48:58] <ravenzz> Cork yes I know, well without the W3C the WHATWG wouldn't even exists I think
[22:49:12] <Cork> ravenzz: why not?
[22:49:17] <wad3g> I need to send a cookie back to the server via AJAX
[22:49:36] <Cork> whatwg exist cause w3c went way to slow, so the browser went together and started a working group
[22:50:00] <magixx32> I have a wrapper div which contains two other divs whom i load images into and float left so they are side-by-side, the wrapper div has a max-height to resize the images and is set to overflow auto. i'm trying to get the wrapper div to get the total unknown width so that it will have correct left and right auto margins however when i try and get the width of the divs 0 is returned, any ideas why?
[22:50:07] <Cork> basically without whatwg we would still be using html4 now
[22:50:34] <Cork> (or broken xhtml)
[22:51:20] <magixx32> im doing console.log($("#imageDisplay img").width());
[22:51:58] <Cork> is the element part of the page when you run that?
[22:52:12] <Cork> the element has to get a page reflow to know it's sizes
[22:53:25] <magixx32> the image is loaded via ajax with $(".mainImage").html($("<img>").attr
[22:53:48] <magixx32> then i call the width
[22:54:08] <ravenzz> Cork that's true too but the idea of implementig features following a standard sounds better to me than, a couple of vendors decide what is good and what is not
[22:54:27] <magixx32> if i try to reference #leftImage or #leftImage img it still returns 0
[22:54:40] <ravenzz> that said I am happy that the whatwg exists, for the reason you said
[22:55:29] <Cork> ravenzz: not really; the spec and then browser implements it was ex css2.1, and... there still isn't a browser that implements all of that standard
[22:55:49] <Cork> ravenzz: css3, html, css4 is based on the features browsers implement
[22:56:51] <Cork> ravenzz: the difference is that one vendor propose something, the others try implementing it, and when two vendors has manage to implement the same proposed spec
[22:57:02] <ravenzz> Cork that's also because there still was too much competition between vendors
[22:57:05] <Cork> and without finding undefined behaviors
[22:57:08] <Cork> you have a standard
[22:57:39] <Cork> ravenzz: not really, it was cause the spec was written and then; this is what should be used and this is how it should work
[22:58:03] <Cork> the problem is; some of the specs from those times, just can't be implemented; at least not without slowing the browser down to a crawl
[22:58:06] <ravenzz> Cork a modular recommendation would work better than that imho
[22:58:40] <Cork> ravenzz: modular is what css3+ does, but it's still the same thing
[22:59:40] <Cork> except html just adds the new feature instead of posting a separate appendix extending the original page
[23:00:05] <ravenzz> that's good
[23:00:08] <Cork> so in css3 and css4 you have to run around over 5-7 separate documents
[23:00:15] <Cork> while html is just one spec; period
[23:01:18] <Cork> ravenzz: well you can get to know what's new from the revisions, and its much less risk missing something cause a later appendix overrules the old decision
[23:02:02] <Cork> for ex css2.1 and css3 conflicts, so you can't be compliant to both
[23:02:27] <Cork> (and ms used that in it's marketing for ie9)
[23:02:38] <magixx32> any other ideas as to what I'm doing wrong? This is what I'm suing
[23:02:38] <magixx32> $("#rightImage").html($("<img>").attr("src", "images/image.png"));
[23:02:38] <magixx32> console.log($("#leftImage img").width());
[23:02:38] <magixx32> <div id="imageDisplay">
[23:02:38] <magixx32> 	<div id="leftImage" class="mainImage"></div>
[23:02:39] <magixx32> 	<div id="rightImage"></div>
[23:02:39] <magixx32>   </div>
[23:02:44] <Cork> "the most css2.1 complaint browser on the market"
[23:02:47] <coldhead> it was better yesterday when you guys were talking about 3d maths
[23:03:00] <Cork> magixx32: don't dump things in the channel
[23:03:06] <Cork> use a paste site
[23:03:23] <Cork> ?p
[23:03:31] <Cork> `p
[23:03:34] <Cork> :/
[23:03:41] <ravenzz> ?paste
[23:03:41] <b-ot> ravenzz: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:03:45] <ravenzz> Cork that sucks, what I am more concerned about is the
[23:03:46] <Cork> ...
[23:04:11] <pingou> hi
[23:04:41] <ravenzz> fact that the whatwg goes fast, too fast maybe so features are not supported everywhere
[23:04:48] <pingou> when adding content to a collapsibleset via jquerymobile, I insert a data-role="button" that seems to be ignored
[23:04:56] <Cork> ravenzz: how can it go too fast?
[23:05:12] <Cork> a spec isn't accepted as published until all vendors agree
[23:05:44] <Cork> it goes into rc when all see it as ok, and out of rc when 50% supports it
[23:05:45] <ravenzz> Cork comparing to the w3c specs
[23:06:16] <graphettion> Help with previous going back to the end - slideshow - http://jsfiddle.net/AxURN/21/
[23:06:17] <Cork> ravenzz: where the browser implements it and 3-4+ years later w3c publish the spec
[23:08:55] <ravenzz> Cork I dunno, I hope that with IE10 things will change... but saying 50% supports it for me means Chrome and FF which have never been my concern
[23:09:05] <tw2113> i heard that the browsers are what determine the standards
[23:09:07] <tw2113> not the other way around
[23:09:23] <tw2113> didn't Microsoft come up with canvas originally?
[23:09:35] <tw2113> or was that Apple
[23:09:57] <ravenzz> apple
[23:10:04] <Cork> ravenzz: gecko and webkit and presto hads to have implemented it, and trident not oppose it
[23:10:25] <Cork> now days ya, its just webkit and gecko
[23:10:37] <tw2113> and soon...blink!
[23:10:46] <Cork> that's basically just webkit so no
[23:10:57] <tw2113> depends on where the Googs takes it
[23:11:00] <chuck8> hi guys
[23:11:03] <Cork> its gecko, trident, webkit and webkit-alike
[23:11:25] <Cork> tw2113: unless they go with rewriting it from scratch it will be webkit
[23:11:46] <Cork> tw2113: the problem isn't about "what it supports" but where it came from; what could cause a problem to implement
[23:12:08] <Cork> and the history of the engine matters more then the manage it
[23:12:08] <tw2113> i think it was paul irish that pointed out there's a nice handful of webkit versions out
[23:12:23] <Cork> *the who manage it
[23:12:23] <tw2113> saying "webkit" doesn't mean it's the same in ios/safari/chrome/android/etc
[23:12:48] <Cork> tw2113: in this context it does
[23:13:01] <Cork> when you test a webpage it it doens't
[23:13:14] <tw2113> depends on how far down you drill :)
[23:13:19] <Cork> not really
[23:13:44] <tw2113> http://paulirish.com/2013/webkit-for-developers/
[23:13:50] <tw2113> for those curious about what i say
[23:13:50] <Cork> the events flow is a similar way, how elements is generated is similar and so on
[23:14:22] <wad3g> I need some guidance on how to send a cookie back server-side using AJAX if any one has a moment
[23:14:32] <Cork> from a spec point of view you want clean house implementations, that comes from totally different angels
[23:14:46] <graphettion> Can someone help me with a slideshow?
[23:14:47] <graphettion> lol
[23:15:01] <Cork> wad3g: the cookie would be sent as long as it has been set for the domain
[23:15:07] <ravenzz> ok we should stop talking about browsers and help people:p
[23:15:32] <wad3g> Well it's cookie generated from a mod built for our CMS
[23:15:34] <graphettion> Pfff! Who helps people anymore? lol, jk
[23:15:56] <Cork> wad3g: well just set it in the header response to the page
[23:16:18] <ravenzz> graphettion any specific reason why you aren't using a plugin?
[23:16:43] <graphettion> I want to create it natively, seems faster that way with less code.
[23:16:47] <graphettion> Don't need extras.
[23:18:19] <ravenzz> graphettion I think size() is deprecated
[23:18:31] <ravenzz> you should use length
[23:19:27] <graphettion> ravenzz: Whoa! Used length and it's not working. Weird.
[23:19:40] <graphettion> nm
[23:19:54] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's all take a short break
[23:19:57] <graphettion> The right syntax might help.
[23:21:10] <nafg_> Test responsive design: https://rawgithub.com/nafg/5507310/raw/responsive.html#http://localhost:8080,0.6,1024x768,1600x1200
[23:21:18] <nafg_> Replace localhost:8080 with whatever
[23:21:41] <wad3g> I'm unfamiliar with cookies. Using Firecookie (I think that's what it's called), there are 5 cookies for the one session. Will I be able to send this based on an ID/name of the cookie?
[23:22:04] <nafg_> wad3g: Send it where?
[23:22:13] <voidpirate> nafg_: what is this?
[23:22:16] <wad3g> Send it server-side
[23:22:22] <ravenzz> graphettion -.- hold on
[23:22:40] <nafg_> wad3g: Aren't cookies sent automatically?
[23:22:42] <graphettion> ravenzz: Take your time, I'm in no hurry.
[23:22:57] <wad3g> All of them?
[23:23:02] <graphettion> ravenzz: I'm just frustrated I don't understand something this basic.
[23:23:19] <nafg_> wad3g: Why don't you look in firebug on the net tab.
[23:23:23] <nafg_> Or use chrome developer tools.
[23:23:43] <darkc0de> Hi guys. Help please - http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/6yPgz/2/ <- how can i put a go back link so that the next dialog box will go back to the previous dialog box. is it possible?
[23:23:44] <darkc0de> if you'll click the click me DIV, it should pop-up a dialog box - then try to click ok again - 2nd dialog box will pop-up. how can i make the 2nd dialog box to go back to the 1st dialog box? is it possible?
[23:23:48] <wad3g> The cookie I need to send is created from a modification. We'll decrypt the cookie server-side and populate a grid based on the UserId sent with the cookie
[23:23:49] <darkc0de> please help
[23:24:29] <nafg_> wad3g: what do you mean modification?
[23:24:46] <nafg_> IIUC cookies are standard headers.
[23:24:51] <coldhead> shoot me first
[23:25:02] <wad3g> We have a mod for our CMS to create this cookie that needs to be sent back server-side
[23:25:29] <wad3g> The cookie is the only thing we need to send in the request
[23:28:22] <wad3g> We're sending the decrypting and sending the cookie server-side for security purposes. I hate our CMS, so I just want to get this finished as this is not my job.
[23:32:17] <ravenzz> graphettion sorry i am back... I'll be back to you in a bit
[23:32:29] <graphettion> ravenzz: np
[23:55:59] <magixx32> why does this report the #leftimage img as 0 in the chrome console but correctly in the editor console: http://jsbin.com/anulug/2#tabs-2
[23:56:14] <magixx32> when i click browse
[23:56:19] <coldhead> some kind of bug?
