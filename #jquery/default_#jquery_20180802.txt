[05:26:22] <solsTiCe> hi. I have used jquery.flot library by the past to draw plot and chart. It's simple to use. Do you have any recommendation for a plot/chart library ?
[05:28:24] <pSouper> hey all o/
[05:29:16] <pSouper> does anyone know why javascript that works on the page doesn't work when for elements used as content in a modal? is it a binding thing
[05:49:03] <solsTiCe> pSouper: Is it on dynamicly added  element ? then you need to use jQuery.fn.on jQuery.fn.on:
[05:50:35] <pSouper> ah. so i was using document on ready but changed it to body on click
[05:50:41] <solsTiCe> https://api.jquery.com/on/#on-events-selector-data-handler
[05:50:50] <pSouper> which kinda got me started on the right track
[05:51:05] <pSouper> thanks solsTiCe - this really helps
[05:51:44] <pSouper> im not liking the 'body on click' solution and think your link will help find one i am more confortable with
[05:51:53] <pSouper> have good one dude o/
[08:39:52] <pSouper> i have a form, i need ot click a button to open a modal with a given part of tat form as the modal body
[08:39:52] <pSouper> my problem is that the jquery that works on the page no longer works now it's within the modal
[08:39:53] <pSouper> i think it's becasue the modal/content didn't "exist" when the javascript was called and so isn't bound.
[08:39:54] <pSouper> my problem is how to re-bind the content now it's in the modal
[10:07:33] <jastrzebski> hey guys, I'm creating an image like this $('#cropped-image').html('<img src="'+dataURL+'"/>');
[10:07:57] <jastrzebski> couple of lines later I'm trying to read naturalWidth of it using $croppedImage.prop('naturalWidth');
[10:08:29] <jastrzebski> $croppedImage is assinged like this var $croppedImage = $('#cropped-image').children('img'); and it works fine, tested with alert($croppedImage.attr("src"));
[10:08:48] <jastrzebski> but naturalWidth equals 0
[10:09:38] <jastrzebski> altought when I click the button (that triggers the code) again it displays me the right natural width
[10:09:40] <jastrzebski> any ideas?
[10:09:50] <taplar> is 'dataURL' an actual data url?
[10:10:01] <jastrzebski> it's base64 image
[10:10:12] <taplar> well, that's interesting
[10:10:40] <taplar> the only thing i can think of is, even though it is a data image, it possibly hasn't rendered yet, so the brower may not yet know what it's dimensions are
[10:10:40] <jastrzebski> fetching src attribute is working fine so I'm assuimg that html is already rendered
[10:10:57] <jastrzebski> I'll try to set timeout to test it I guess
[10:11:06] <taplar> getting the attributes from the dom doesn't necessarily mean it's rendered
[10:11:18] <taplar> r/attributes/properties/
[10:16:28] <jastrzebski> taplar: aye, window.setTimeout solved my problem
[10:16:54] <taplar> good deal
[10:17:12] <jastrzebski> I'm gonna try to wrap everything in .load function lol
[10:19:24] <jastrzebski> works now, thanks taplar
[10:19:37] <taplar> np
[11:36:56] <pSouper> im putting a few form fields to a modal but when i eit te fields and close the modal  those fields they have not changed
[11:37:45] <pSouper> it is possible that typing in form field doesnt change the data ?
[12:05:28] <ZeroWalker> is there no real function to generate cookies per see, do you have to write it manually in text form? (is that cause it's hijacking html?)
[12:25:10] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[12:25:30] <robertmaxrees> spam still isn't over?
[12:26:08] <ZeroWalker> you mean my questions;s?
[12:26:19] <robertmaxrees> nope/.
[12:26:26] <robertmaxrees> the network-wide spam attacks.
[12:27:08] <ZeroWalker> oh? i don't see anything
[12:27:22] <robertmaxrees> it's not in here because i set +r
[12:28:23] <ZeroWalker> not sure waht that does, are you a moderator or something?
[12:28:28] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[12:29:04] <robertmaxrees> +r makes it so people have to register to talk in the channel.
[12:34:24] <robertmaxrees> weeee
[12:42:50] <robertmaxrees> ZeroWalker what do you mean by yor cookie question?
[12:45:38] <royalty> if I have a js object like {'0': '#toggle-handle-reveal'}
[12:45:58] <royalty> how would i access the '0' key's value?
[12:46:17] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:46:23] <royalty> I tried var toggleItems = {'0': '#toggle-handle-reveal'};
[12:46:31] <robertmaxrees> royalty why would you use numbers as key values?
[12:46:40] <robertmaxrees> instead of an array?
[12:46:50] <royalty> they reflect keys of a value in a form
[12:46:53] <royalty> i mean
[12:46:54] <royalty> sorry
[12:47:05] <royalty> the object keys reflect form input values
[12:47:11] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[12:47:12] <robertmaxrees> wat
[12:47:21] <royalty> let's say i have a radio input
[12:47:33] <royalty> value 0 label No
[12:47:38] <royalty> value 1 label Yes
[12:47:58] <royalty> I want my object to mean if 0 is selected toggle this section
[12:48:23] <royalty> so I created an object like {'0': '#selectorofsection'}
[12:48:35] <robertmaxrees> i would use "yes" and "no" or something that isn't a number in that case fwiw.
[12:48:41] <robertmaxrees> but theObject[keyName]
[12:49:10] <royalty> I've tried both and I keep coming up with anything but #toggle-handle-reveal
[12:50:24] <robertmaxrees> show me in a fiddle?
[12:51:05] <royalty> okay give me a sec
[12:52:47] <royalty> ok i must be doing something wrong
[12:52:51] <royalty> heh because it works in my fiddle
[12:53:12] <royalty> it was as simple as i thought, something must be broken
[12:53:43] <ZeroWalker> well looking at how it says you create cookies, it seems you do stuff like "thing=bla, expire: date"
[12:54:20] <ZeroWalker> it's not actually some "createcookie(data,daysIntoTheFuture);"
[12:54:30] <robertmaxrees> ZeroWalker that's just the API you're given.
[12:54:49] <robertmaxrees> there are a ton of libraries for cookies.
[12:55:03] <robertmaxrees> you can always use one of those.
[12:59:29] <ZeroWalker> yeah i get that you can just hide it, i just thought it was, more mathematical i guess, not string based. As i guess the cookie literally has the date in text?
[12:59:31] <taplar> i assume spam is on going
[12:59:44] <robertmaxrees> "mathematical"?
[13:00:07] <robertmaxrees> ZeroWalker the cookie api is a little funky, sure, but easy enough to work with.
[13:00:49] <taplar> or use localStorage
[13:10:26] <ZeroWalker> not string based (seems to be very common in the HTTP world though). But if that's how it is it's fine, just got a bit confused by it as it looked weird, will play around with it a bit:)
[13:11:30] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:11:36] <robertmaxrees> heh - "http world"
[13:12:44] <ZeroWalker> or is it html? confusing the terms maybe lol, totally crap with that part, which i need to improve obviously as it's kinda hard not to use it on a website lol
[13:12:50] <ZeroWalker> one step at a time!
[13:13:11] <markh> we're all in an http world :)
[13:13:26] <robertmaxrees> HTTP/HTTPS are the protocols
[13:14:26] <ZeroWalker> ah right, so then those commands are in HTML
[13:14:30] <robertmaxrees> nope./
[13:14:32] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:14:37] <ZeroWalker> damn it
[13:14:43] <ZeroWalker> is there something else that starts with H?
[13:14:44] <robertmaxrees> the cookie object is apart of the DOM.
[13:14:53] <ZeroWalker> i thought DOM was part of HTML?
[13:15:12] <robertmaxrees> DOM is an API of sorts.
[13:17:11] <robertmaxrees> it's how JS can use the browser, sorta.
[13:17:28] <ZeroWalker> oh
[13:18:10] <ZeroWalker> well that made things weirder so that's something
[13:18:14] <robertmaxrees> short for Document Object Model
[13:18:17] <robertmaxrees> how so?
[13:18:17] <ZeroWalker> or well not weirder, different
[13:19:18] <ZeroWalker> well i had just assumed that DOM element stuff thing was all part of HTML, and then ther was javascript, css is confusing so i just see it as som fancy way to change styles and stuff for now
[13:19:47] <robertmaxrees> HTML is a different spec
[13:19:51] <ZeroWalker> but good to know it's not part of it, bad assumption
[13:19:52] <robertmaxrees> same with CSS
[13:19:59] <robertmaxrees> there's also CSSOM
[13:20:05] <robertmaxrees> which is like DOM, but for CSS
[13:20:15] <ZeroWalker> ah
[13:21:38] <ZeroWalker> kinda interesting, so many different specs that can operate with HTML like it does. Probably obvious stuff i guess
[13:21:44] <robertmaxrees> eh.
[13:22:07] <robertmaxrees> they don't necessarily "operate with html" directly.
[13:22:11] <taplar> ^^^
[13:22:26] <robertmaxrees> html, css, and js are all different kinds of files browsers can natively read.
[13:22:51] <robertmaxrees> the browser loads and parses those all differently.
[13:23:24] <robertmaxrees> they intermingle in the browser, but not as HTML, CSS and JS directly.
[13:23:32] <robertmaxrees> they all get translated.
[13:23:55] <ZeroWalker> well found some stuff that seems like a very hackish way to force html to respond the way you want it to via javascript etc. So i guess it's a lot of ductape
[13:24:05] <royalty> what's the deal with this? https://jsfiddle.net/b6f9hcjq/3/
[13:24:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:24:19] <robertmaxrees> ZeroWalker that doesn't make sense...
[13:24:34] <taplar> royalty: JSON expects " for the internals
[13:24:48] <taplar> {"key":"value"}
[13:24:51] <taplar> it doesn't like '
[13:24:52] <royalty> oh...
[13:25:00] <robertmaxrees> because JSON is not javascript ;)
[13:25:05] <royalty> good to know, heh
[13:25:08] <ZeroWalker> guess i explained it wrong, basically it looks hackinsh coming from a normal programing api when communicating between things
[13:25:20] <royalty> is there a way to set an object as a data property in html
[13:25:29] <robertmaxrees> royalty huh?
[13:25:32] <royalty> like
[13:25:34] <taplar> sure, data='{...}'
[13:25:40] <taplar> sure, data-key='{...}'
[13:25:47] <ZeroWalker> here some stuff i think can literally be writing to the html and then reloading or something, just to achieve the wanted result, you don't actually give a direct command to achieve something
[13:25:54] <royalty> <div data-id='{"wow":"how"}'
[13:25:59] <taplar> sure
[13:26:06] <royalty> oh, you just have to use single quotes
[13:26:10] <taplar> and jQuery data('id') will auto convert it to an object
[13:26:11] <royalty> and inside use double quotes
[13:26:13] <robertmaxrees> ZeroWalker js doesn't write to "the html" though.
[13:26:14] <ZeroWalker> at least that's how it feels like some things are done, maybe it's not like that at all?
[13:26:15] <robertmaxrees> you modify the DOM.
[13:26:34] <royalty> taplar, thanks, valuable info, do you know if it's not kosher as far as w3c standards to do that
[13:26:47] <royalty> set a data-attribute not using double quotes
[13:26:48] <taplar> it depends
[13:26:49] <ZeroWalker> but you can do stuff like, writing to the body etc right?
[13:26:57] <taplar> oh, that, no, don't worry about that
[13:26:59] <robertmaxrees> ZeroWalker that's modifying the DOM.
[13:27:02] <royalty> oh ok, lol
[13:27:03] <ZeroWalker> oh
[13:27:06] <royalty> taplar, thanks very much
[13:27:16] <robertmaxrees> JS interfaces with the DOM, not the markup.
[13:27:39] <taplar> royalty: though if possible I would say you might want to break out the object into individual data keys
[13:27:42] <ZeroWalker> i tohought that entire thing was HTML, that whole .html file if you will (or well not every part in it, but yeah)
[13:28:13] <robertmaxrees> the html is loaded, parsed, and rendered.
[13:28:15] <ZeroWalker> and i thought it loaded to memory or etc, and then javascript could modify that directly if it wanted to, then the browser would just think that the page lookd like that
[13:28:25] <royalty> taplar, it seems annoying because i have two key/value pairs that should be tied as they determine behavior
[13:28:36] <robertmaxrees> ZeroWalker i mean, basically.  except you're interfacing with the DOM.
[13:28:43] <royalty> i could define them individually but there may be many key/value pairs
[13:28:46] <robertmaxrees> you modify the DOM and the browser reflects those changes.
[13:29:00] <taplar> royalty: yeah, if there are variable keys it may make more sense just to put the object on there
[13:29:05] <royalty> ok
[13:29:11] <ZeroWalker> can i think of DOM as being the page in it's Live condition here?
[13:29:18] <ZeroWalker> rendered*
[13:29:23] <robertmaxrees> basicalyl.
[13:29:29] <robertmaxrees> plus some other features.
[13:29:36] <robertmaxrees> like the cookie api :)
[13:29:46] <ZeroWalker> okay that make sense
[13:29:55] <ZeroWalker> yeah thanks for reminding me, time to dig into that now;)
[13:32:54] <ZeroWalker> oh right now i remember why i wasn't doing that already, ttrying to get a good debuggin/autocomplete stuff going on in Visual Studio Code, so might as well ask here if anyone has any recommendations
[13:35:06] <taplar> in regards to what specifically?
[13:36:03] <taplar> debugging you can do in your browser and optionally with forced debugger; statements
[13:36:20] <taplar> but I'm unclear what specifically you're looking for autocomplete with
[13:40:59] <ZeroWalker> syntax(show errors in typing etc), autocomplete, would be nice with debugging in it somehow. While chrome is nice, it's not that fast when i have to write some change, go to chrome and reload (yes i am lazy, and do small changes to test stuff all the time)
[13:41:45] <ZeroWalker> would love to get php debugging working as well, but that seems like a to total pain so leaving that alone for now
[13:43:06] <taplar> you should have some basic syntax checks if you open the file (and it's a js file) and it recognizes it as a javascript file, or you change the type selection to be javascript.  There should also be some autocomplete, but I don't remember it autocompleting for jquery methods.
[13:44:35] <ZeroWalker> yeah i got that working, and it's the jquery, it seems that it Should work, seems to be a bit messy setting it up though. will see if i can solve it:)
[13:45:04] <ZeroWalker> i am sadly a syntax junkie, love these things;P
[13:46:31] <taplar> do you mean syntax or styling?  cause everyone has to be a syntax junkie
[13:48:21] <ZeroWalker> i guess it's styling then, i meant the "show live that this is incorrect syntax"
[13:48:38] <ZeroWalker> obviously you need correct syntax in the end though xd
[13:49:49] <taplar> yeah, it should have basic javascript syntax highlighting already
[13:51:43] <ZeroWalker> yeah it does, will say if i get jquery to work, so i can brag for a short moment
[13:56:55] <taplar> jQuery Code Snippets looks like it has quite a few of the methods in there
[13:59:18] <ZeroWalker> ah yeah saw that one, though is jQuery a thing? all my stuff seems to use $ and some stuff
[13:59:29] <ZeroWalker> not wirting jquery directly
[13:59:36] <taplar> both normally work
[14:00:09] <taplar> The global window variable is always jQuery.  If it is not running in noConflict mode, then the global window $ will also be jQuery
[14:02:26] <taplar> In cases that you are running in noConflict mode, you can use a document ready or a simple IIFE and pass jQuery in as $ and it doesn't make much difference
[14:12:17] <ZeroWalker> oh, a bit confusing, not used to the meaing of $ yet. I just use it cause the examples i see use them, so thought that's how you used jQuery
[14:13:35] <taplar> that's fine.  $ is a valid variable name, just like 'a' or 'b' would be.  For whatever reason, they choose to also use that character as their primary variable name in addition to their jQuery variable
[14:15:46] <ZeroWalker> yeah but didn't think it was even a variable, just saw it as part of the function name
[14:16:01] <taplar> it -is- the function name, :)
[14:16:22] <ZeroWalker> isn't it the object, like "this.function"
[14:16:46] <ZeroWalker> like it's not a free floating function, but it's owned by jquery (or window in this case?)
[14:16:49] <taplar> if you want to get technical, functions are objects in javascript
[14:17:01] <taplar> but $ is a reference to a function
[14:17:08] <taplar> the init function of the library
[14:17:59] <ZeroWalker> but wait, what's the global window variable then, isn't that $?
[14:18:13] <ZeroWalker> but so, does every function in your scrips exist within the global window?
[14:18:18] <taplar> it can be, if you are not in noConflict mode
[14:18:31] <taplar> but both $ and jQuery are global variables on the window object
[14:18:39] <ZeroWalker> haven't changed anything so if that's the deafault
[14:18:55] <taplar> window is the owner of all your methods
[14:19:04] <taplar> and objects
[14:19:13] <taplar> and those objects can own their own methods
[14:19:17] <ZeroWalker> oh i thought you meant that $ was the global window, like that was a thing (master owner so to speak)
[14:19:19] <taplar> at which point they are not global
[14:19:30] <ZeroWalker> okay that make sense
[14:19:51] <ZeroWalker> so basically, i can kinda see the window (your entire script?) as an instance
[14:19:57] <taplar> sure
[14:20:10] <ZeroWalker> nice ty
[14:20:11] <taplar> but window you can think of quite literally as your browser window
[14:20:23] <ZeroWalker> oh
[14:20:31] <taplar> DOM wise, that's what it's meant to represent
[14:20:34] <ZeroWalker> ah right think you can do window.close() and stuff
[14:21:38] <ZeroWalker> but $ is just a variable that points to init in jquery, and normally in javascript $ is Not used up by antything?
[14:21:43] <ZeroWalker> just to make sure i am not missing
[14:22:02] <taplar> it is not used by the language for anything specific, no
[14:22:28] <taplar> but jQuery isn't the only thing that has used $ before as it's global reference, which is why the noConflict exists
[14:23:27] <taplar> https://j11y.io/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery   <= this is what happens any time you call $(selector)
[14:25:25] <ZeroWalker> ah
[14:25:50] <ZeroWalker> hmm
[14:27:08] <ZeroWalker> wait, so $.post == jQuery.fn.init(post)?
[14:27:22] <ZeroWalker> looks wrong, not hte same access
[14:27:30] <taplar> try it and see.  type 'jQuery.post' in that input
[14:27:40] <ZeroWalker> oh, neat
[14:28:47] <ZeroWalker> hmm, find it kinda weird to read, i mean it gives me a function, but the function is nameless
[14:29:15] <ZeroWalker> i guess it's calling that function with a preset parameter
[14:29:43] <taplar> javascript doesn't require you to pass in the same number of arguments to a method
[14:29:49] <taplar> if you don't pass them in, they will be undefined
[14:32:12] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/63afom90/
[14:35:20] <ZeroWalker> that do make sense, that it has default parameters or something, but i don't get how it's accessed, i mean, the $ used ".post" but the function it shows is nameless, so i am guessing what's happening is something like $.send(post) ?
[14:36:06] <taplar> That's just how that site displays them.  It didn't put the $.post = part in there, or however jQuery assigns it, because you searched specifically for the method
[14:36:20] <taplar> It's showing you just the method
[14:38:21] <taplar> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.js
[14:38:41] <taplar> You can find the actual code block by searching for: jQuery.each( [ "get", "post" ]
[14:40:15] <ZeroWalker> ah
[14:41:07] <ZeroWalker> wlel that one looked even weirder lol, but it does at least show what's going on
[14:41:22] <ZeroWalker> quite hard syntax to wrap my head around
[14:41:34] <taplar> it takes a little bit
[14:41:42] <taplar> but lots of goodies to learn from
[14:41:48] <ZeroWalker> though most native javascript stuff seems to be fairly straightforward at least;)
[14:42:11] <ZeroWalker> yeah seems to be a ton of cool stuff that you can do if you know how to use it well
[14:42:26] <robertmaxrees> one of the nice things about JS is the language basics are actually pretty simple imo
[14:45:42] <ZeroWalker> and it kinda standard with the () {} things, that helps me a lot
[14:45:56] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:46:01] <ZeroWalker> i have a horrible time using python cause of that
[14:47:25] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:54:09] <robertmaxrees> ugh the smoke from that fire is really getting to me
[14:54:23] <taplar> what's going on?
[14:54:28] <robertmaxrees> the carr fire?
[14:54:59] <taplar> has it gotten closer to you?
[14:55:23] <robertmaxrees> redding's about an hour and a half away.  but the smoke has been traveling down this way for a while.
[14:56:04] <ZeroWalker> wait, a car is on fire, and is coming closer;S?
[14:56:21] <robertmaxrees> no - there's a large fire in nothern california called the carr fire.
[14:56:52] <robertmaxrees> over 115000 acres burned so far.
[14:56:54] <ZeroWalker> btw, jquery local or from their website, anything i should care about?
[14:56:59] <ZeroWalker> oh
[14:57:01] <robertmaxrees> ZeroWalker depends.
[14:57:03] <ZeroWalker> thought it was a typo
[14:57:06] <ZeroWalker> damn
[14:57:12] <ZeroWalker> that's a lot of fire
[14:57:29] <robertmaxrees> ZeroWalker by "from their website" do you mean from a CDN?
[14:57:46] <ZeroWalker> code.jquery.com
[14:57:49] <taplar> if jQuery serves a crucial part of your application, you should serve it from local
[14:57:58] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:58:19] <ZeroWalker> okay will download it then
[14:58:38] <ZeroWalker> not sure which version, but it seems min is the way to go, slim i think didn't work out for me
[14:58:43] <taplar> the point being, if a cdn goes down, you have to take into account how much that will affect you
[14:58:48] <robertmaxrees> ZeroWalker it depends.
[14:58:49] <taplar> if you don't write in a backup plan
[14:59:08] <robertmaxrees> ZeroWalker but the size differences really aren't that big of a deal tbh.
[14:59:29] <ZeroWalker> yeah was thinking of that, not something that would have a real affect on me per se, but meh why not
[14:59:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:00:02] <ZeroWalker> but i am guessing the biggest doesn't have something that's super useful in common cases
[15:00:23] <taplar> you lost me
[15:01:07] <ZeroWalker> the non-min == biggest
[15:01:15] <robertmaxrees> ... doesn't have?
[15:01:25] <taplar> non-minified is just the more readable version
[15:01:26] <robertmaxrees> that sentence doesn't make sense
[15:01:41] <taplar> but your browser doesn't need the human readable version
[15:01:46] <ZeroWalker> doesn't have, basically missing, not available
[15:01:52] <ZeroWalker> oh
[15:02:01] <ZeroWalker> so min is simply compressed
[15:02:06] <robertmaxrees> minified
[15:02:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[15:02:16] <ZeroWalker> okay, thought it was a trimmed version
[15:02:23] <robertmaxrees> that's slim
[15:02:33] <ZeroWalker> yeah thought that was was even more trimmed xd
[16:44:36] <robertmaxrees> oontz oontz oontz
[16:46:00] <robertmaxrees> let's see if it's any better now.
[17:54:41] <taplar> mehbeh
[17:58:09] <robertmaxrees> iiiiiiiinteresting.
[17:58:19] <taplar> mmm?
[17:58:45] <robertmaxrees> that the attacks seem to have subsided.

[19:00:26] <robertmaxrees> enjoy folks./
[20:06:52] <ZeroWalker> how do you get onprogress event to work when uploading a file using FormData?  It just gives one event and that's when it's completed
[20:08:00] <ZeroWalker> also, does it just keep buffering until the whole file is uploaded until it starts writing, cause it seems that way looking at the stats
[20:08:16] <Woet> ZeroWalker: jquery doesn't have an "onprogress" event.
[20:08:37] <Woet> ZeroWalker: XHR does though.
[20:08:42] <ZeroWalker> oh right, i am using that one yeah
[20:09:02] <ZeroWalker> as i was unsure if jquery had it, onyl saw success
[20:09:13] <Woet> ZeroWalker: can you share your code?
[20:09:21] <ZeroWalker> sure
[20:09:27] <Woet> ZeroWalker: be sure to defend it in beforeSend
[20:09:43] <ZeroWalker> what?
[20:10:04] <Woet> define *
[20:11:16] <ZeroWalker> note sure what you mean, the FormData?
[20:11:16] <ZeroWalker> http://paste.awesom.eu/pK2D&ln
[20:11:21] <ZeroWalker> there's the jquery part
[20:11:32] <Woet> oh, you're not using .ajax at all
[20:11:43] <Woet> not sure why this is a #jquery question then
[20:11:55] <Woet> but i'm pretty sure you should define .onprogress before .open
[20:11:57] <ZeroWalker> true
[20:12:08] <Woet> not sure though - i haven't touched XHR for years
[20:12:13] <ZeroWalker> oh, thought it was the opposite
[20:12:19] <ZeroWalker> well i can always try
[20:12:41] <ZeroWalker> are there alternatives, does ajax support something similar?
[20:12:52] <ZeroWalker> the progress events
[20:13:13] <Woet> theres an example at the bottom of https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15668339/can-onprogress-functionality-be-added-to-jquery-ajax-by-using-xhrfields that might work
[20:13:14] <ZeroWalker> or maybe you can while loop read it or something?
[20:17:20] <ZeroWalker> okay solved it, knew there was an upload version of the event, but i thought it was a separate object which i couldn't create, so thought it was some server side thingy that got called lol
[20:17:23] <ZeroWalker> thanks
[22:05:06] <zenox> hi, i'm trying to add a listener to all form inputs that do not have the class 'form_modified_ignore', this is my selector, but it's adding it to all inputs - what's wrong: $('form *:not(.form_modified_ignore)')
[22:13:45] <pavonia> By all input you mean even the ones no inside the form?
[22:14:39] <zenox> no, just ones inside the form
[22:15:32] <zenox> i have an input inside the form with that class, but it's still having the listener applied
[22:17:21] <pavonia> What events are you listening to?
[22:22:38] <zenox> changed, but that's irrelevant
[22:22:44] <zenox> the problem is with the selector
[22:25:23] <pavonia> Okay, with changed it's not the case but it could have been the event actually fired on another element than the expected as the selector is unnecessarily general
[22:27:22] <zenox> i know
[22:27:32] <zenox> but the problem is the selector
[22:29:37] <pavonia> Why not input:not(..)?
[22:32:50] <zenox> because it has to include selects and textareas
[22:35:30] <zenox> oh, that includes buttons as well :(
