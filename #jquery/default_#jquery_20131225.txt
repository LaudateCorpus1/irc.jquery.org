[00:14:26] <DarkGhost> http://devcollective.net/obie is there a plugin for an img slideshow but for text? http://devcollective.net/obie the very bottom with the blue arrows.. or is there a better method?
[03:43:37] <inthl> I have html-encoded strings in a json object, e.g. &uuml; for the character ü - now I am using that information out of this array to update an input field, which is e.g. $("input[name=address]" ).val(addresspool[$(this).val()].address);
[03:44:01] <inthl> where the name of the input is "company" and the json is addresspool - the selected index is $(this).val()
[03:44:27] <inthl> but unfortunately, it does not display that letter as ü then, but as &uuml; _within_ the input
[03:44:37] <inthl> is there a way to convert this ?
[03:46:00] <cusco_> you mean the value of a input does not convert html entities
[03:46:00] <cusco_> ?
[03:46:29] <cusco_> I guess I would lookup a js function just for that
[03:48:27] <inthl> google was not my friend, or at least, there is none. however, I'm beginning to think that this is not a good idea in case some address contains e.g. Moe's bar ...that would have a quote there which would be converted and might affect the page display
[05:22:43] <ali4ever4> how to select for elements NOT containing specific text
[05:24:41] <ali4ever4> its ok i got it
[05:24:54] <ali4ever4> :not(:contains(mytext))
[05:42:47] <_biff> hi
[05:43:03] <_biff> why do i get json parse error, however i get valid json object
[05:43:16] <_biff> i checked  with json validator
[05:43:33] <Woet> because your json validator does not use the same parsing as however you're parsing it
[05:43:36] <Woet> or you're giving it different json
[05:43:39] <Woet> ?demo
[05:43:39] <b-ot> Woet: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:43:43] <Woet> ^ _biff
[05:43:54] <_biff> ?:D different json?
[05:43:57] <b-ot> _biff: differentj.so - â˜º AVAILABLE
[05:44:29] <Woet> _biff: yes, for example you debug in the wrong place or you copy/pasted the wrong JSON to the json validator
[05:44:31] <Woet> please provide a demo
[05:44:58] <_biff> Woet http://pastebin.com/3pqvBLdv
[05:45:21] <Woet> how is that a demo?
[05:45:29] <_biff> itsnot that...
[05:45:31] <Woet> please read the actual message from b-ot
[05:45:33] <Woet> ?demo _biff
[05:45:38] <Woet> hmm
[05:45:39] <Woet> ?demo
[05:45:40] <b-ot> Woet: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:45:49] <Woet> create a /working/ demo
[05:45:55] <Woet> a pastebin is not a working demo.
[05:46:08] <_biff> ye i understand but i dont think that this is so cimplicated...
[05:46:11] <_biff> to udnerstand
[05:46:21] <_biff> *complicated
[05:46:40] <Woet> how does a pastebin of JSON data show me what is wrong with your code?
[05:46:46] <Woet> please create a working demo or figure it out yourself
[05:47:08] <Woet> if you don't want to put any effort into it then neither do I
[05:47:31] <_biff> what kind of code...im just separate the incoming data qwith jquery ...like with this $('#html_message').html(response.html_message);
[05:47:42] <Woet> i give up, good luck
[05:48:05] <Woet> if you can't follow simple instructions then there is nothing I can do
[05:52:25] <Kamuela> Merry Christmas!
[05:55:46] <_biff> Woet sorry but these parse error caused by the newline characters...how could i avoid them?...should i replace in db the newline and tabs with \n and \t?
[05:56:02] <_biff> or its also enough during query...
[05:58:25] <Woet> _biff: newlines are fine in JSON - http://jsfiddle.net/AYFRp/
[05:59:28] <_biff> woet i believe...but if i place one i get the parse error:)
[05:59:39] <Woet> then you are doing it wrong
[05:59:43] <Woet> i've asked you for a demo 2 times now
[06:01:08] <_biff> woet...
[06:01:38] <_biff> oh nothing...
[06:02:25] <_biff> Woet maybe we have misunderstoood...where do you place here linebreak?
[06:02:40] <Woet> you said its caused by newlines in your JSON
[06:02:42] <Woet> i said newlines in JSON are fine
[06:02:58] <Woet> i'm gonna ask you for the fourth time now, please create a demo of the problem so I can see whats wrong with your code
[06:03:01] <_biff> Woet sorry we have misunderstood
[06:03:11] <_biff> of course in the josn data shouldnt be linebreaks
[06:03:13] <_biff> or tabs
[06:03:25] <Woet> i'm gonna tell you for the third time now
[06:03:28] <Woet> newlines and tabs are fine in JSON
[06:03:30] <Woet> jquery parses it fine
[06:03:32] <_biff> woet i know but its complicated toi reprocude in jsfiddle my code
[06:03:38] <Woet> as shown in the jsfiddle i gave you
[06:03:42] <Woet> why?
[06:03:55] <Woet> just copy paste the relevant part of your code
[06:04:12] <Woet> if it's complicated then you should make it less complicated
[06:04:18] <_biff> Woet ok im trying again
[06:04:18] <Woet> parsing JSON is literally 1 or 2 lines of code
[06:04:38] <Woet> or just link to your site and explain how to reproduce it
[06:06:24] <_biff> woet... ok now its working...but how can i publish...
[06:06:37] <_biff> http://jsfiddle.net/72pa5/
[06:06:39] <_biff> Woet
[06:06:44] <_biff> so here is working
[06:06:49] <_biff> but in my code doesnot working
[06:06:52] <_biff> i got parse error
[06:06:56] <Woet> so there is another problem in your code
[06:07:00] <Woet> completely unrelated to the JSON
[06:07:01] <_biff> and this is the same josn what i get
[06:07:12] <_biff> ok but what the hell...
[06:07:22] <Woet> and that is why I told you to create a demo 20 minutes ago
[06:07:37] <_biff> this isnt a demo?:)
[06:07:40] <Woet> it is
[06:07:45] <_biff> ok so here it is:D
[06:07:45] <Woet> and once you did (after 20 minutes)
[06:07:51] <Woet> it's obvious that the problem is not in that code
[06:08:02] <Woet> we could have ruled that out way earlier if you just created a demo back then
[06:08:08] <_biff> but thereis not so much code realted to this aftzer this step...
[06:08:18] <Woet> apparently there is
[06:08:29] <_biff> im thinking
[06:08:39] <Woet> create a demo of all the code that is relevant
[06:08:43] <Woet> so i can see what causes the parse error
[06:09:16] <_biff> pfff.
[06:09:22] <_biff> yeah....
[06:25:30] <Velveeta> woet: i see you've met _biffâ€¦ i had the sme round n round with him yesterday about creating me a demo on a separate issue
[06:25:38] <Woet> interesting
[06:25:46] <Velveeta> another one that was "too difficult to make a demo out of"
[06:25:48] <Woet> he only took 25 minutes to create a 2 line fiddle
[06:25:55] <Woet> because "its complicated to reproduce"
[06:26:06] <Velveeta> which i made a demo out of in about 2 minutes once he gave me a pastebin, and showed that the problem wasn't in that code either
[06:27:03] <Woet> :D
[06:31:24] <_biff> :D
[06:32:03] <_biff> so u know me:)
[06:32:58] <_biff> Woet and Velveeta
[06:33:10] <Woet> i know you enough to ignore future questions, indeed
[06:35:19] <_biff> bad sign
[06:35:48] <Velveeta> it would help if it didn't take 20 minutes at a time of constantly asking you for a demo before you would whip one up for us
[06:36:10] <Velveeta> it doesn't matter how many times you ask a question over and over if we can't answer it without seeing a demo
[06:36:35] <_biff> i dont know why u think that i dont want to make an example...
[06:36:40] <_biff> a demo
[06:37:14] <_biff> im just thinking that time that wheter there is a "simple" stupid mistake what you know "right now"
[06:39:53] <_biff> this wouldnt be angularity(this is the right word in english?)
[06:40:06] <Velveeta> for 20 minutes you're thinking this? while asking the same question over and over?
[06:40:12] <_biff> of course u dont know what i know or what i dont know
[06:40:27] <Velveeta> in both our cases, you could have taken 2 minutes to make a demo and gotten an answer in 30 seconds
[06:41:02] <Velveeta> you're supposed to come asking questions when you've already spent a bunch of time trying to think through the problem, and are ready for 3rd party help, which we happily offer
[06:41:04] <_biff> Velveeta....öm yes thinking on the stupid little mistakes takes the longest time
[06:41:32] <Velveeta> but when you take upwards of half an hour thinking through your problem and stringing us along instead of just giving us something clear to work from, it eats up time that we could be helping other people instead
[06:42:00] <_biff> ok i understand
[06:42:55] <_biff> thank u all for your patience
[06:48:07] <lianzinho> guys, how can I get a list of all the javascript objects I'm currently working on my browser section?
[06:57:35] <Velveeta> lianzinho: you can examine the window object, it'll show you all globally-declared objects you have going onâ€¦ depending on your current scope, though, and the scope of other objects, there's not really a way to get 'all' objects...
[06:59:24] <lianzinho> Velveeta: yeah I sawâ€¦ I'm using the cycle plugin for a slideshow, and I needed to access some read only properties, but its buried inside it I have to inspect slider.data('cycle.opts').currSlide to get it
[06:59:58] <Velveeta> yeah, depending on how code is structured, you can sometimes force your way in like that, but not always
[07:01:14] <lianzinho> I was just trying to know where the object wasâ€¦ since the 'slider' bit is the selector wrapped in the jQuery $('.selector') but I couldnt
[07:01:29] <lianzinho> see the properties inspecting just the slider itself
[07:01:51] <Velveeta> gotcha
[07:02:13] <lianzinho> it would just show me its children
[07:23:03] <hfp> Merry Christmas all!
[07:27:17] <hfp> I have a question. I have a form in a Jquery modal dialog that I am using jQuery validation to validate. I would like that when the form is valid, the form itself disappears, the #processing div appears and the form to be submitted. I would also like that the result of formprocessing.php not be shown: I don't want the page to refresh at all. 1. I don't know where to put the jQuery code for the hiding and showing elements to be triggere
[07:27:17] <hfp> submission only once the form is valid and 2. I don't know how to prevent the php parsing script from refreshing the page. 3. Should I put anything in action="" for the form's html? Thanks for your help!
[08:14:03] <hfp> Relevant jQuery code: http://pastie.org/private/crrubalqjubrkqh37mhhjq, HTML: http://pastie.org/private/bniixorvdzesa3yvqly1ig
[08:20:55] <Velveeta> hfp: the php script doesn't have anything to do with whether the page refreshes or not.. to prevent that from happening, you need to receive the event object in your submit handler, and preventDefault() on it
[08:24:17] <hfp> Velveeta: This is what confuses me. What is passed to the submit handler? The form to be submitted? The event?
[08:24:27] <Velveeta> the event
[08:24:39] <Velveeta> http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[08:25:10] <hfp> Ok so I can do event.preventDefault(); event.submit(function() {my jQuery DOM things}); to achieve what I am trying to do?
[08:26:08] <Velveeta> nope, you would do event.preventDefault() to *prevent* the form from submitting through a regular fashion, which is what causes the page refreshâ€¦ you then have to submit the form via ajax yourself to get that data to your php script
[08:27:23] <hfp> Hmmm. So in my HTML I would need to put back action="foo.php", right?
[08:28:16] <hfp> This is confusing as well because the jQuery validation examples I saw all have empty action=""
[08:32:04] <hfp> I don't understand. This page http://jqueryvalidation.org/validate/ says that I have to do the form submit (ajax or not) in submitHandler. Yet Velveeta is saying to only have the preventDefault() there and do the actual submit elsewhere. There clearly is something I am missing to understand how to put it all together
[08:32:05] <Velveeta> you don't need any action if you're submitting your form via ajax
[08:32:54] <Velveeta> a lot of people may store the intended php script in the action tag so they can reference it programmatically in their ajax call, or so their form can degrade to default behavior in the absence of javascript, but you don't need anything in the action or method attributes technically, since you're not going to submit that form naturally
[08:33:26] <Velveeta> here's an example on how to get started with ajax form submissions: http://hayageek.com/jquery-ajax-form-submit/
[08:59:36] <Siecje> If I double click on "One" and click Delete the form is not actually submitted. I assume it is because I have a blur on the field. http://jsfiddle.net/rh6fD/13/
[09:14:56] <joroci> Siecje
[09:15:11] <joroci> it's not because of the blur it's because you are triggering a dblclick event
[09:15:16] <bigbugjava> I'm getting from server-side an object or an array (doesn't matter can get anyone of them), it contain, https://buckets..image.jpg, it happends onload of document, and I need to make an image slider on that load, it will be dynamic, and not preset like most, is it possible?
[09:16:09] <joroci> why not?
[09:16:49] <bigbugjava> joroci ?
[09:17:00] <joroci> why shouldn't it be possible
[09:17:21] <joroci> ?
[09:17:35] <bigbugjava> joroci I see all jquery image slider that are on gist and such, their html is already set with the links
[09:18:09] <joroci> you can create whatever html you want with js/jquery
[09:18:28] <Siecje> joroci: The blur triggers a double click event to toggle it back to a span
[09:18:53] <bigbugjava> joroci can you recommened me a good slider? easy to setup and has good enough tools?
[09:19:16] <joroci> i'm not familiar with any, but it's not hard to make one your own
[09:19:25] <joroci> on your own
[09:19:43] <joroci> Siecje so make a different function to make it a span
[09:19:49] <bigbugjava> na na na, thats nuts lol
[09:19:51] <bigbugjava> ;)
[09:20:08] <joroci> or do something before you trigger
[09:20:22] <joroci> got to my station gtg
[09:58:39] <filadome> can someone help me with some jquery code: http://jsfiddle.net/3Dp2L/
[09:59:00] <filadome> i want to keep atleast one file upload element available to allow multiple files
[10:29:05] <hfp> Why do I keep getting this: TypeError: $(...).preventDefault is not a function
[10:29:24] <hfp> I am trying to preventDefault() when submitting a form in a jQuery modal dialog using jQuery validation plugin
[10:29:43] <hfp> I am putting this in the validate() method under submitHandler
[10:37:17] <hugo_moss> hey velveeta you there
[10:39:34] <grafi> hfp paste code
[10:45:41] <hfp> jQuery: http://pastie.org/private/o0tlnarb8mdzqczrypcisq HTML: http://pastie.org/private/bniixorvdzesa3yvqly1ig
[10:46:03] <hfp> With this, it works except for the fact that preventDefault() has no effect and the page is refreshed to the php script
[10:46:39] <hfp> It doesn't throw any errors either
[11:17:26] <shoky> hfp: the validation plugin already prevents the default. and then you call form.submit() which calls the native submit on the form (without triggering an event)
[11:18:24] <hfp> shoky: Right. So where should I submit the form?
[11:18:43] <shoky> hfp: do you want it to actually submit, or not.?
[11:18:58] <hfp> I want it to submit but I don't want the page to refresh
[11:19:12] <shoky> submitting a form does a page refresh
[11:19:20] <shoky> you want to do an ajax request instead
[11:19:56] <hfp> with .ajaxSubmit() ?
[11:20:07] <shoky> for example
[11:20:15] <papepapes__> You can submit by AJAX then
[11:20:44] <hfp> Ok. So instead of form.submit() I put form.ajaxSubmit() ?
[11:20:59] <shoky> no
[11:21:11] <shoky> $(form).ajaxSubmit()  but only if you also included that plugin
[11:21:33] <shoky> jquery form plugin or smth
[11:21:49] <hfp> Ok, I'll have to include that plugin
[11:21:54] <papepapes__> why not get the values with $ and submit using $.post
[11:21:57] <shoky> or you can do it manually
[11:23:01] <shoky> $.ajax({ url: form.action, type: form.method, data: $(form).serialize() })    might work
[11:23:03] <hfp> I think what complicated a bit is that the actual submit button is defined using the .dialog() method. I have $('#form').submit() on click. I'm guessing this also overrides the submitHandler?
[11:23:20] <shoky> hfp no it uses that same handler i think
[11:23:42] <shoky> cause you're calling .submit() on the jquery wrapper, not on the native form element
[11:24:11] <hfp> I see. It's probably since the console.log I put on the submitHandler shows when pressing the button
[11:24:16] <hfp> probable*
[11:24:31] <hfp> Ok let me add the ajaxSubmit plugin and report back
[11:27:27] <hfp> Wow it finally works as I intended!
[11:27:31] <hfp> Thanks guys
[11:29:35] <Kamuela> I'm glad shoky could help, hfp
[11:31:31] <hfp> This triggered a somewhat related question: what is the difference between 1. a method and a function and 2. a plugin and a library?
[11:35:01] <DarkGhost> Merry xmas.
[11:35:04] <DarkGhost> http://devcollective.net/obie is there a plugin img slideshow but for text? http://devcollective.net/obie the very bottom with the blue arrows.. or is there a better method?
[11:35:31] <papepapes__> a function return something and a method does not
[11:35:47] <papepapes__> a plugin extends a system already functionning
[11:36:38] <papepapes__> a library is a code that serves a purpose and that can be used in many places and many different projects
[11:39:04] <shoky> hfp: a function is just any old function, you know what it is. "method" is usually used for functions that are fields of some object
[11:40:24] <shoky> and methods can return stuff just like functions can
[11:40:42] <papepapes__> well in your code you can BUT
[11:41:01] <papepapes__> Conceptually they are not the same
[11:41:14] <shoky> with regards to return values they're the same
[11:41:24] <shoky> .append is a method, it returns a value
[11:41:50] <papepapes__> what i try to put here is there is the code and the concepts
[11:42:09] <papepapes__> concepts are the same in other langages too like php, ruby...
[11:42:35] <shoky> i agree, just didn't understand the "return" part..
[11:42:39] <papepapes__> This is why it is important but in the code certain langages allow you to do
[11:42:40] <DarkGhost> http://devcollective.net/obie is there a plugin img slideshow but for text? http://devcollective.net/obie the very bottom with the blue arrows.. or is there a better method?
[11:42:51] <papepapes__> certain non orthodox things
[11:53:39] <DarkGhost> someonee I'm dieing ot nkow how to do this!
[11:53:50] <DarkGhost> i don't think theres an slide left/right animation though
[11:55:45] <papepapes__> DarkGhost: check CaroufRedSel
[11:57:08] <DarkGhost> wordpress?
[11:57:44] <papepapes__> Node, it is JS
[12:00:40] <Kamuela> I just realized that with HTML5 you can code servers in the web browser
[12:02:06] <papepapes__> it is impossible to code server in a browser
[12:02:10] <papepapes__> Ever
[12:09:45] <Kamuela> papepapes__: can't be. there are web sockets
[12:13:19] <papepapes__> Kamuela: websocket are made to communicate in both ways with a server unlike HTTP
[12:13:29] <papepapes__> You always need a server
[12:13:53] <papepapes__> this is why the browser is named a client
[12:14:39] <papepapes__> Even if you do not have your own server like when you use a cloud SAAS plateform, you always make requests to a server
[12:15:02] <papepapes__> HTTP === client request/server responds type of communication
[12:15:09] <Kamuela> papepapes__: you're telling me a web socket cannot setup a listening service on a port?
[12:15:26] <papepapes__> Kamuela: NEVER EVER !
[12:15:31] <papepapes__> sacrilege
[12:16:08] <Kamuela> You're saying sacrilege
[12:16:20] <Kamuela> Which means it is not a limitation of the web server
[12:16:23] <Kamuela> web browser*
[12:16:27] <papepapes__> a browser cannot open a port on system because it is an application
[12:16:42] <papepapes__> to open a port you need to access the system
[12:16:50] <papepapes__> which a brwser cannot do
[12:16:52] <Kamuela> Because it is a sandboxed application you mean
[12:17:01] <papepapes__> because it is just a simple app
[12:17:15] <papepapes__> even in a sandbox it cannot
[12:17:39] <papepapes__> security is my primary job so i know what i'm talking about
[12:17:58] <papepapes__> but coding got my soul
[12:18:46] <Kamuela> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket seems like a full socket that tunnels through port 80
[12:20:48] <papepapes__> Yeah the port 80 is the port on the server
[12:21:21] <papepapes__> the one the is refered too when you type www.domain.com with using :80
[12:21:52] <papepapes__> on localhost, when you setup a local server with nodejs you use port like 8080 for example
[12:22:11] <papepapes__> but on the internet 80 is the default port for web servers
[12:23:13] <papepapes__> you can check port numbers on the IANA website
[12:23:48] <papepapes__> if web browsers could communicate without using a server it would be peer to peer p2p man
[12:23:56] <papepapes__> and it would be awesome !
[12:24:32] <papepapes__> You can issue a p2p communicate in web browser with WEBRTC BUT
[12:24:59] <papepapes__> you still need to a server for the signaling part of the communication
[12:26:39] <Kamuela> Hmm, I probably wasn't clear with what I meant. WebSockets are HTML5 technology that allows you to achieve socket behavior in the browser. It is definitely something that requires a listening server.
[12:27:06] <papepapes__> Yep
[12:27:28] <papepapes__> It is used mainly to achieve two ways communications
[12:27:55] <papepapes__> because HTTP is only one way: A REQUEST got A RESPONSE and it's done
[12:28:08] <hugo_moss> im having a problem where, i am debouncing a touchmove event handler thats also a closure. inside the handler, it uses setTimeout.  However, ontouchmove, console.log says it has set the timer (which is very short=300ms) but the settimeout handler isn't executed, until i release my finger.
[12:28:24] <papepapes__> with websockets the server and the clien keep the connection open SO
[12:28:44] <papepapes__> the server can contact the client too at any moment
[12:29:16] <hugo_moss> when just creating a setTimeout, that monitors ontouchmove, the setTimeout is executed on every move, so I dont know, is it the closure thats causing this?
[12:29:33] <papepapes__> hugo_moss: have you tried to use _underscore or lodash
[12:30:00] <hugo_moss> no
[12:30:05] <hugo_moss> ill take a look at those
[12:30:12] <hugo_moss> but im using the debouncer from:
[12:30:23] <hugo_moss> http://unscriptable.com/2009/03/20/debouncing-javascript-methods/
[12:31:46] <papepapes__>  You should try the because they already have a debounce implementation
[12:33:30] <hugo_moss> ok
[12:35:01] <hugo_moss> do they have a custom builder?
[12:35:06] <nerium> Anyone know if it possible to add a loading screen for jquery mobile?
[12:35:29] <hugo_moss> ill just copy the function
[12:35:45] <papepapes__> hugo_moss:http://lodash.com/docs#debounce
[12:36:09] <papepapes__> hugo_moss: be sure to include the lodash library in your headers
[12:36:53] <hugo_moss> was thinking of using underscore
[12:37:17] <papepapes__> it's the same approach. You can one or another
[12:39:18] <hugo_moss> hmm they look pretty similar
[12:39:41] <hugo_moss> to what im using
[12:47:22] <hugo_moss> only difference being, underscore uses a timestamp, while the link uses clearTimeout
[12:48:37] <ravenzz> hugo_moss you don't need a library for that :)
[12:48:48] <papepapes__> yeah but if you only need to use the debounce stuff it does not make a difference
[12:49:07] <papepapes__> just use one , maybe the one with smallest footprint
[12:49:20] <papepapes__> and load it via CDNJS too
[12:50:16] <hugo_moss> how does it prevent it from being triggered if it doesn't call clearTimeout?
[12:50:23] <hugo_moss> it just sets timeout to null
[12:50:52] <hugo_moss> oh
[12:50:57] <hugo_moss> it just keeps setting the timeout
[12:51:06] <hugo_moss> with a new time into the future
[12:51:44] <ravenzz> jQuery should have its debounce and throttle functions
[12:51:48] <ravenzz> hugo_moss https://gist.github.com/Pushplaybang/3341936
[12:53:06] <hugo_moss> yea thats the one i was using from unscriptable
[12:53:15] <hugo_moss> the problem was though:
[12:53:19] <ravenzz> what's wrong with that?
[12:53:33] <hugo_moss> im having a problem where, i am debouncing a touchmove event handler thats also a closure. inside the handler, it uses setTimeout.  However, ontouchmove, console.log says it has set the timer (which is very short=300ms) but the settimeout handler isn't executed, until i release my finger.
[12:53:44] <hugo_moss> when just creating a setTimeout, that monitors ontouchmove, the setTimeout is executed on every move, so I dont know, is it the closure thats causing this?
[12:54:14] <hugo_moss> its not real-time
[12:54:51] <hugo_moss> the settimeout should occur 300 ms after ive stopped moving, (and another thing im doing is checking if the scrolltop has changed by a good amount)
[12:55:03] <hugo_moss> but its never triggered until i release my finger, instead of a touchmove
[12:55:13] <ravenzz> can you create a testcase on jsfiddle.net?
[12:55:15] <papepapes__> hugo_moss: i don't understand what you are trying to achieve
[12:55:39] <hugo_moss> ok
[12:55:49] <papepapes__> what is wrong with using the debounce of lodash or underscore
[12:56:53] <ravenzz> hugo_moss read this btw http://drupalmotion.com/article/debounce-and-throttle-visual-explanation
[12:57:16] <ravenzz> you may want to throttle that one
[12:58:09] <hugo_moss> http://jsfiddle.net/QBSU9/
[13:00:05] <hugo_moss> it works, it just isnt realtime
[13:00:23] <hugo_moss> i have to wait to release my finger for the settimeout callback to execute
[13:00:37] <hugo_moss> hey velveeta
[13:00:46] <Velveeta> hello hello
[13:00:48] <papepapes__> hugo_moss: you mean you have perf issues
[13:00:54] <ravenzz> mh
[13:00:57] <Velveeta> just finished eating a bunch of hamâ€¦. i'm almost ready for a nap
[13:00:59] <papepapes__> hello Velveeta
[13:01:02] <hugo_moss> perf issues?
[13:01:08] <Velveeta> heya papepapes__
[13:01:11] <ravenzz> hugo_moss why are you mixing up the debounce fn and your custom fn?
[13:01:15] <papepapes__> you said it is slow
[13:01:45] <hugo_moss> its delayed until i release my finger
[13:01:58] <hugo_moss> hey velveeta we were talking about the function that im using with your suggestion
[13:02:04] <hugo_moss> if you can take a look
[13:02:09] <Velveeta> sure
[13:02:15] <hugo_moss> http://jsfiddle.net/QBSU9/
[13:02:36] <hugo_moss> the only problem, is that on ios, it doesn't call the setTimeout callback until i release my finger
[13:02:49] <ravenzz> hugo_moss try to separate the two first
[13:03:01] <hugo_moss> they were separated in the beginning
[13:03:04] <ravenzz> it'll be easier to figure out what is going on there
[13:03:30] <Velveeta> yeah, with the continual running of your touchmove event to check those scrollTop values, you can scrap the debounce method in there
[13:04:30] <hugo_moss> ok
[13:05:20] <Velveeta> the debounce method was to try to just keep from running a callback for hundreds of touchmove events, but since those are hard to stop for a period of time because of minute little variations even when sitting still with your finger on the screen, you had to process them as they came in, to compare scrollTop values
[13:05:41] <Velveeta> so then in that case, if you're going to process them all anyway, there's no need to debounce the callback, you can just execute it immediately when the condition is right
[13:05:57] <hugo_moss> right
[13:06:56] <hugo_moss> now the only problem i had this was that, because new touchmoves would come in all the time, i had to add a check at the beginning to see whether to accept the new touchmoves or not
[13:07:12] <hugo_moss> so not to cancel the settimeout
[13:08:15] <Velveeta> depending on how fast they come in, you could have a counter running for each, and only process your checks based on a modulus operation, so like: if (++count % 10 === 0) { }
[13:08:24] <Velveeta> then you're only processing every 10th touchmove event
[13:16:56] <hugo_moss> ok ive changed it to this: http://jsfiddle.net/QBSU9/1/
[13:18:34] <hugo_moss> hmm same problem
[13:18:46] <hugo_moss> it doesn't seem to execute until you release the finger
[13:19:30] <Velveeta> you're still using a timeout, strip that out
[13:22:30] <Velveeta> hugo_moss: something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/QBSU9/2/
[13:42:14] <aolko> hey there
[13:42:38] <aolko> who can help me with jquery + xml?
[13:43:30] <aolko> ...anyone?
[13:43:49] <Velveeta> throw your question out
[13:43:59] <aolko> this http://pastie.org/8575890
[13:44:09] <tw2113> hold on, i'm connecting to the NSA to get your question
[13:44:36] <aolko> this code displays BOTH message and entry if there's a current entry AND older entry
[13:44:37] <Velveeta> tw2113: getNSAResults() should return a deferred promise that you can attach your callbacks to
[13:45:11] <tw2113> they didn't document that
[13:45:16] <tw2113> it's like they're into their secrecy
[13:45:20] <Velveeta> tw2113: they don't document much
[13:45:22] <aolko> it should work like this: if there are no current entries at all => display the message
[13:45:24] <Velveeta> well, "document"
[13:46:07] <tw2113> they document a lot, just not publicly
[13:46:32] <Velveeta> it should still be available via NSA.prototype properties
[13:46:55] <tw2113> sorry aolko i don't know a lot with parsing xml with js
[13:47:14] <Velveeta> parsing xml w/ jquery is about as simple as parsing html, that's one nice thing about it
[13:47:14] <aolko> any chance to try with current knowledge?
[13:47:25] <Velveeta> however, i don't understand what your question actually is
[13:47:33] <Velveeta> you threw out a snippet and said what it should do..
[13:48:23] <aolko> so, my current xml is like this http://pastie.org/8575907
[13:48:46] <aolko> so it contains today's and yesterday's entries
[13:48:53] <Velveeta> ok
[13:49:08] <aolko> and somehow output show both MSG and today's entry
[13:49:27] <aolko> it SHOULD show only today's entry
[13:49:43] <Velveeta> so how about you put this together into a jsfiddle example, it should be a lot easier to help you that way
[13:49:49] <Velveeta> as we'll be able to actually tinker with the code
[13:50:13] <Velveeta> but instead of using your ajax request to fetch your xml, just prepopulate a variable with the expected xml
[13:50:24] <Velveeta> and pretend like the code snippet is just executing your success function
[13:51:24] <aolko> alright
[13:51:44] <hugo_moss> it seems that ios is blocking my function call until touches are finished
[13:51:49] <hugo_moss> im not sure though
[13:52:29] <Velveeta> hugo_moss: it's not executing your function call at all during move events? because yesterday, you determined that the events were flooding in constantly during touchmove
[13:52:40] <hugo_moss> the console.log's do
[13:52:54] <hugo_moss> everytime i move, the console log prints,
[13:53:03] <hugo_moss> and its executing
[13:53:17] <hugo_moss> but the function calls all happen after i stop touching the screen
[13:57:14] <Velveeta> aolko: ok, this looks like what i think your jsfiddle should look like: http://jsfiddle.net/BXPdG/2/
[13:57:31] <Velveeta> hugo_moss: can you show the current version of your code?
[13:58:06] <hugo_moss> i think its something else thats causing this
[13:58:10] <aolko> so, my fiddle is not currently working, instead a working sample http://m1itv.ru/index.php#
[13:59:59] <Velveeta> aolko: so, using my fiddle, i can see that part of your problem is that you're looping through each program in the xml response, and either overwriting the contents of #list or appending to it
[14:00:11] <Velveeta> in the xml you provided, the first date matches, and the 2nd one doesn't
[14:00:39] <Velveeta> so the first time through the loop, it adds a new ul to #list, and the 2nd time through, it doesn't match, so it overwrites #list to show no data, so all you see at the end of the loop is no data
[14:01:08] <Velveeta> if i change the .html() call in the else branch of that statement to a .append instead, i get this: http://jsfiddle.net/BXPdG/4/
[14:01:22] <Velveeta> that includes a matching message for the first program element, and a no data message for the 2nd
[14:03:42] <hugo_moss> ok for some reason when i used document.ontouchmove= handlerfactory(); instead of $container.on('touchmove', handlerfactory()), it wouldn't work
[14:03:52] <hugo_moss> what the method does is lazyload reveal images
[14:04:04] <hugo_moss> when i changed it to $container.on, it works
[14:08:14] <Velveeta> so there was no handlerfactory in your previous code that i saw :D can i see an updated version?
[14:10:23] <hugo_moss> the handlerfactory is just debounce
[14:10:52] <hugo_moss> same, just named it that way when i said it
[14:11:03] <hugo_moss> handlerfactory() = debounce()
[14:11:07] <hugo_moss> but here is an updated fiddle
[14:12:11] <hugo_moss> http://jsfiddle.net/QBSU9/3/
[14:12:31] <hugo_moss> why would it be different if i used document.ontouchmove, and $container.on(touchmove
[14:13:06] <hugo_moss> or it should be window.ontouchmove?
[14:13:08] <Velveeta> well, for one thing, certain events don't bubble properly in ios, depending on whether they're attached to a child of he body, or the document itself
[14:13:20] <hugo_moss> ok
[14:13:30] <Velveeta> i know that click events don't fire on empty portions of the body, but will fire for empty portions of a child of body
[14:13:38] <hugo_moss> ok good to know
[14:13:49] <Velveeta> for all the shit apple got right over the years, they sure fucked up their mobile safari implementation
[14:15:07] <aolko> right
[14:15:28] <aolko> figured it out
[14:15:44] <Velveeta> aolko: oh yeah?
[14:16:04] <aolko> http://pastie.org/8575938
[14:16:09] <aolko> counts
[14:16:23] <Velveeta> ahhhh yes, there you go
[14:16:58] <aolko> and now, the harder thing http://prntscr.com/2dxo1u
[14:17:09] <aolko> same, BUT with time and progressbar
[14:17:19] <Velveeta> you could also do it without a count variable, if you started by emptying the element: $('#list').empty(); and then appended for each time through that loop, and after the loop, did a check for: if ($('#list').is(':empty')) { }
[14:17:21] <aolko> idk on this one ;)
[14:19:03] <aolko> seriously tho, how to add time checking? i.e. when entry1 time == entry2 time, hide entry1
[14:19:06] <Velveeta> aolko: i don't know what i'm looking at in that example, that's why fiddles are more preferable, they limit the scope of the problem
[14:19:48] <tw2113> Happy new year Cheese!
[14:19:49] <Velveeta> hugo_moss: so is it actually outputting stuff to the console with that method?
[14:19:53] <Velveeta> happy new year tw!
[14:20:05] <Velveeta> sometimes when i see your name, i think of an old bbs game, tradewars
[14:20:08] <Velveeta> that game was the shit
[14:20:22] <tw2113> others think tribal warfare
[14:20:28] <aolko> @Velveeta, it's a list of entries with times and a huge progressbar inside, AND when entry1 time == entry2 time etc, previous (1,2,3...) one grays out
[14:20:34] <Velveeta> i'm sure still others think time warner
[14:20:54] <Velveeta> aolko: but i don't see any of that, all i see is a noisey page with blinking things :D
[14:20:54] <tw2113> clearly i'm thinking ahead 100 years
[14:21:19] <tw2113> someday i'll be hip with my nick that I've used since 1999
[14:21:39] <Velveeta> i'm not sure when i started using velveeta, but i wanna say it was around 95
[14:21:58] <Velveeta> maybe one of these days, the good people at kraft foods will want to buy my twitter handle off of me
[14:22:29] <Velveeta> funny enough, on twitter, both velveeta and kraft don't belong to kraft foods, they're both owned by guys from austin tx that deal in web development stuff :D
[14:22:35] <aolko> (almost) same thing http://www.bbc.co.uk/tv/on-now
[14:23:29] <Velveeta> aolko: but that doesn't tell me anything that might help solving your problemâ€¦ showing me someone else's completed implementation doesn't show me any of the code you're trying to use to solve your own problem, or the data structure you're sending for it to parse
[14:23:39] <Velveeta> that's why i'm again going to ask you for a jsfiddle example
[14:25:46] <aolko> well, the thing is, i don't know how to make it like: time now = time1 => fadeout entry1, time now = time2 => fadeout entry2 etc
[14:26:21] <hugo_moss> i didnt put in place any console output for the method but i will in a sec.  but yeah its working, it lags only by a little and im performing the lazyload reveal on touchstart touchmove touchend and scroll.  the only time it doesn't reveal, is if you do a super fast swipe up, by the time the page scrolls down to those images, the touchmove, touchend, and scroll have already fired, scroll fires
[14:26:21] <hugo_moss> before the decceleration
[14:26:49] <Velveeta> hugo_moss: well that sounds like progress at least :D
[14:26:57] <hugo_moss> yeah thank you man
[14:27:01] <Velveeta> not a problem
[14:27:11] <Velveeta> aolko: it depends on what your data is structured like
[14:27:20] <hugo_moss> only problem is accounting for decceleration
[14:27:21] <aolko> same xml
[14:27:24] <Velveeta> i mean comparisons and fadeOuts are simple stuff
[14:27:29] <Velveeta> but i need more to go on than pseudo code
[14:27:38] <hugo_moss> and its pretty cool that it doesn't go really slow because of firing on all those events
[14:27:52] <aolko> as you've noticed, my xml pastie has <time>
[14:28:08] <Velveeta> hugo_moss: yeah that was one thing i was afraid of, calculating scrollTop constantly can sometimes bog down a client
[14:28:25] <Velveeta> aolko: yeah i just jumped back to that tab and saw it, so what are you trying to fade and when
[14:28:40] <Velveeta> you want to fade out any entries that match for the current time?
[14:28:59] <Velveeta> also, is it current date *and* time or just current time?
[14:29:26] <aolko> as time progresses and current entry "ends" (time = entry2) then fadeout entry1 and put entry2
[14:29:56] <Velveeta> so you mean after the items are displayed, as time progresses, without a page load, fade out items as their time comes around?
[14:30:29] <aolko> also, is it current date *and* time or just current time?  Well, if,say, it's 00:01 and all "yesterday" entries are "ended", then roll a next day entries
[14:30:31] <aolko> kind off
[14:30:33] <aolko> of*
[14:30:44] <aolko> >so you mean after the items are displayed, as time progresses, without a page load, fade out items as their time comes around?  yes
[14:32:19] <Velveeta> and how often are you wanting to fade them out? and when do you mean when 00:01 hits and yesterday's entries are ended, roll a next day entries? this is the problem with vague descriptions, it's easier for me if you attempt to write some code to demonstrate logically what you're trying to accomplish, and then let me tweak that to do what you're actually wanting to do, in a jsfiddle example
[14:32:40] <Velveeta> so you only want to display current day items in #list
[14:32:48] <Velveeta> and as their time rolls around, you want to fade them out
[14:33:00] <Velveeta> and when midnight hits, you want to display the next day's items?
[14:33:05] <Velveeta> with the same behavior?
[14:33:13] <tw2113> so much automation
[14:33:14] <Velveeta> am i understanding all of that correctly?
[14:34:00] <aolko> the "list" updates once in 5-10 minutes
[14:34:13] <aolko> or per minute
[14:34:34] <Velveeta> those items that i just spewed out, are they all correct? or am i off?
[14:34:34] <aolko> yes, you've got it right
[14:34:37] <Velveeta> ok
[14:34:41] <Velveeta> let me see what i can do
[14:34:51] <aolko> you know, like tv online schedules
[14:35:36] <DarkGhost> anyone know aobut this caroufredsel plugin?
[14:36:59] <tw2113> i dunno about anyone else, but it almost sounds better to have aolko auto-generate the xml, and then just parse through it and only display the nodes that are relevant to the current date
[14:37:22] <tw2113> the xml can be created regularly with a cron job
[14:37:24] <Velveeta> tw2113: that's what he's trying to do
[14:37:31] <aolko> but what about filling it with items?
[14:37:32] <tw2113> just checking
[14:37:34] <Velveeta> except that he's generating more than just the current day
[14:37:44] <aolko> oh,sorry
[14:38:46] <tw2113> the filling with items is before the js comes into play
[14:40:47] <g33kyboi> Hi there
[14:41:06] <aolko> hi
[14:41:12] <aolko> and merry christmas
[14:43:39] <g33kyboi> I am using google plus interactive post within my app. A user can either decide to share or cancel sharing an interactive post. Is it possible to detect which option the user clicked through jquery? (Why am curious is that the interactive post is rendered in an iframe and the iframe is generated by google). Thank you
[14:55:17] <Velveeta> aolko: here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/BXPdG/14/
[14:56:07] <Velveeta> i have the first item set to my local timezone just so i could test that it worked, you'll want to change it to your own to make sure it works for youâ€¦ within a minute, you should see the 1 item disappear (if you set it to the next minute from where you go, or an expired time)
[14:56:23] <Velveeta> also, at midnight, it will wipe the list altogether and reprocess the XML for the new current day
[14:56:29] <aolko> thank you
[14:57:12] <aolko> can we exchange skype? 'Cos i'm not a often visitor here
[14:59:55] <Velveeta> my only skype id is used for work, and i don't give it out on here, you'll just have to drop back in here ;)
[15:01:06] <aolko> well, alrighty then, i'll drop in, if there will be questions
[15:01:33] <aolko> but for now, should drop off, 3am, you know ;)
[15:29:51] <hugo_moss> velveeta: i think what im trying to do is impossible
[15:30:26] <Velveeta> i don't know that i would call it impossible, just difficult
[15:31:03] <hugo_moss> when the touchmove is triggered, it changes the background-images. i output a console log to show that. these background-images print in the console before, they are revealed on the screen
[15:31:17] <hugo_moss> when i release my finger, then the screen shows the new revealed images
[15:31:44] <Velveeta> yeah i'm not sure what you're trying to actually accomplish
[15:32:09] <Velveeta> i only have a couple of details so far, about comparing wanting to determine when scrolling stops during a touchmove
[15:32:17] <hugo_moss> the background images should show once i do a touchmove, not release the finger
[15:32:36] <hugo_moss> which is really a touchend
[15:32:52] <Velveeta> so this is what, an image lazy-load?
[15:32:59] <hugo_moss> im trying to show the images, on a touchmove, but apparently it does it on a touchend
[15:33:04] <hugo_moss> yeah
[15:33:17] <hugo_moss> im using mika tuupola's lazy load plugin on github
[15:33:31] <hugo_moss> and i made some changes
[15:33:32] <Velveeta> have you considered something like super scroll o rama? http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/
[15:33:51] <Velveeta> that might help you control the scrollability on touch devices with a little more precision
[15:33:53] <hugo_moss> i dont think its the plugin
[15:34:08] <Velveeta> it's not a plugin, it's an add-on library of sorts
[15:34:32] <hugo_moss> because the images should paint on the screen, as soon as the jquery.css background image changes
[15:34:39] <hugo_moss> from a placeholder, to the actual image
[15:34:56] <hugo_moss> and this is triggered on touchmove, however nothing happens until i release my finger
[15:35:02] <Velveeta> ios itself doesn't hide images when you scroll does it? because if it does, there's no gonna be a way around that
[15:35:15] <Velveeta> not*
[15:35:44] <hugo_moss> no it doesn't hide the images
[15:35:53] <hugo_moss> what do you mean by hide the images?
[15:36:03] <Velveeta> i mean you said something about the images disappearing during scroll i thought
[15:36:29] <Velveeta> maybe not, i think i was reading that wrong
[15:36:29] <hugo_moss> no they dont disappear, let me explain
[15:36:51] <hugo_moss> before the page is loaded, the divs are set with a background-image,
[15:36:53] <Velveeta> so you just need to know when an image is in the viewport, and then load its src
[15:36:58] <Velveeta> ok
[15:36:59] <hugo_moss> a placeholder
[15:37:03] <hugo_moss> those images show fine
[15:37:07] <hugo_moss> however all im doing
[15:37:36] <hugo_moss> is on a touchmove, check scrolltop, reveal background-image by setting the background-image to the actual image,
[15:37:47] <hugo_moss> using the jquery css
[15:37:50] <hugo_moss> method
[15:37:56] <Velveeta> got it
[15:38:11] <hugo_moss> but theres one more tidbit
[15:38:27] <Velveeta> so as the user scrolls, and new divs come into view in the viewport, you want to set their background-image url to actually load the image, and not before
[15:38:31] <hugo_moss> the update method that does this (which is in the touchmove handler after the scrolltop check)
[15:38:35] <arphen> The data variable/parameter keeps accumulating data, even though the server side only sends single objects. why? http://pastebin.com/uuFk4fBR
[15:39:10] <hugo_moss> is it checks if the images are in the viewport at the time of the touchmove, and then an event is triggered to switch background-images
[15:39:36] <hugo_moss> yea velveeeta
[15:39:42] <hugo_moss> that exactly it
[15:39:55] <hugo_moss> thats what im trying to do
[15:40:09] <Velveeta> so i'm looking at this pastebin, what do you mean the data variable/parameter keeps accumulating data?
[15:40:14] <Velveeta> which data variable? i see multiple
[15:41:23] <arphen> Velveeta, in both getjson calls
[15:42:00] <arphen> i know
[15:42:04] <Velveeta> right, that's multiple instances of 'data', so i'm curious what he means
[15:42:05] <arphen> it makes absolutely no sense
[15:42:17] <arphen> yeah both accumulate
[15:42:18] <Velveeta> oh, arphen === hugo_moss?
[15:42:25] <arphen> im not hugo moss
[15:42:27] <arphen> wtf
[15:42:49] <Velveeta> lol, he stopped talking and you started explaining his code, i was like "did he change names when i wasn't looking?"
[15:43:16] <arphen> ? i asked the data question ;)
[15:43:21] <arphen> they both accumulate
[15:43:40] <Velveeta> oh whoops.. people are starting to run together in my head
[15:43:54] <arphen> im debugging server side, and i can see only one object is being sent at a time
[15:43:54] <Velveeta> ok, so what do you mean both "accumulate"?
[15:44:13] <hugo_moss> http://jsfiddle.net/QBSU9/4/
[15:44:15] <arphen> but in my browser i start getting more and more objects, the more often i click the button
[15:44:16] <Velveeta> right, only 1 would be sent at a time, because those are separate calls to getJson
[15:44:21] <hugo_moss> thats basically the whole thing, its very simple
[15:44:32] <arphen> look.
[15:44:37] <arphen> ill show you
[15:44:47] <hugo_moss> i removed the methods that check if theyre in the viewport
[15:44:48] <Velveeta> arphen: of coruse you would, because you're constantly appending new items to those elements
[15:45:05] <Velveeta> each time you click, you trigger buildlist() for a container
[15:45:23] <Velveeta> and within that, the getJSON call's success callback appends a bunch of nodes to its respective container
[15:45:35] <Velveeta> so each time you click, you'll continue getting more elements appended to those containers
[15:45:44] <arphen> yes
[15:45:48] <arphen> but the funny thing is
[15:45:56] <arphen> when i do $(ELEMENT).html("")
[15:45:58] <arphen> and click
[15:46:07] <arphen> i get even more elements than before
[15:46:17] <Velveeta> ok, show me
[15:46:19] <arphen> as you can see im loggin the data object
[15:46:21] <arphen> http://imgur.com/UfrGpbB
[15:46:31] <arphen> and i can see data being really big
[15:46:50] <Velveeta> well that doesn't show me anything i can inspect
[15:47:22] <arphen> i know..
[15:47:29] <arphen> damn
[15:47:44] <arphen> so assuming i get one object per time
[15:47:51] <arphen> how can i clear all elements i added
[15:47:57] <arphen> is html("") good?
[15:48:33] <Velveeta> that's fine, yes, you can also use .empty() which has slightly less overhead
[15:49:59] <arphen> when i do html("") the elements all disappear
[15:50:06] <Velveeta> right
[15:50:08] <arphen> when i click once more i have one element than i used to have
[15:50:20] <arphen> just as if the "data" had been preserved somewhere
[15:50:43] <Velveeta> well, based on that code, i can assure you that data is being destroyed at the end of each callback, it's local to that callback scope
[15:50:58] <Velveeta> however, you might need to set some breakpoints, to make sure that the callback is only being called once
[15:51:29] <Velveeta> you might also need to check to make sure that any compiled markup variable is being cleared out, let me take another look at the code
[15:51:49] <arphen> yeah it makes no sense that a parameter would be persisted
[15:51:53] <arphen> its just ive been on this for an hour
[15:51:59] <arphen> i feel sad
[15:52:02] <Velveeta> oh yeah, here's your problem
[15:52:21] <Velveeta> actually maybe not
[15:52:31] <Velveeta> but in your TrainingEntry function that those getJSON callbacks call
[15:52:36] <Velveeta> all of your variables in that function are global
[15:52:47] <arphen> oh jesus
[15:52:53] <arphen> i need var in javascript to make it local right
[15:52:56] <Velveeta> yep
[15:52:59] <arphen> .......................
[15:52:59] <Velveeta> see if that clears it up
[15:53:01] <arphen> thank you
[15:53:17] <Velveeta> that may not be the issue because it looks like you're reinitializing all of them inside that function block
[15:53:19] <Velveeta> but it's worth a try
[15:53:31] <arphen> yes of course it will
[15:53:40] <arphen> because the "base" element keeps growing
[15:53:43] <arphen> i keep appending
[15:53:45] <arphen> its global
[15:53:48] <arphen> i append to base
[15:53:51] <arphen> it gets huge
[15:54:07] <Velveeta> right, but the first line is base = $('<div></div>').etc
[15:54:14] <Velveeta> so you're reinitializing it there
[15:54:22] <Velveeta> so that's why i say it may or may not do anything
[15:54:31] <arphen> it fixed it
[15:54:34] <arphen> js is just strange
[15:54:38] <Velveeta> woo hoo!
[15:54:47] <Velveeta> it's not strange, you just have to know the rules, like any other language
[15:54:55] <hugo_moss> cool
[15:54:58] <arphen> is it ok if i cry a little?
[15:54:59] <arphen> ^
[15:55:10] <Velveeta> you know what? it's christmas.. go ahead and cry a lot
[15:55:15] <Velveeta> splurge
[15:55:55] <arphen> i just went from writing django /python to writing js for ajaxalization
[15:56:08] <arphen> its like switching from a racecar to a carriage
[15:56:13] <arphen> its really dragging me down
[15:56:15] <hugo_moss> velveeta, did ya get that link i pasted
[15:56:23] <arphen> thanks for helping me.
[15:56:56] <Velveeta> arphen: no problemoâ€¦ and trust me, there are plenty of javascript racecars out there, some highly-tuned onesâ€¦ the problem is that there are a lot more javascript pintos out there to come across in the meantime
[15:57:06] <Velveeta> hugo_moss: yep, i got it, i'm a little lost in it :D
[15:57:13] <hugo_moss> ok
[15:57:17] <hugo_moss> i can explain
[15:57:39] <hugo_moss> theres a line that sets the touchmove handler to debounce()
[15:57:52] <hugo_moss> and that attaches the handler
[15:58:06] <hugo_moss> in debounce it checks if there was a scrolltop change > 0
[15:58:16] <hugo_moss> if there is, it calls update()
[15:58:23] <hugo_moss> and update() just checks if the images are in the viewport
[15:58:56] <hugo_moss> if the images are in the viewport, it triggers jquery.lazyload.appear, and which trigger the images to reveal themselves
[15:59:06] <hugo_moss> and just change the background-image using jquery css
[15:59:07] <hugo_moss> thats it
[15:59:10] <Velveeta> ok, got it
[15:59:33] <Velveeta> so i wonder if event broadcasts are frozen (outside of touchmove) during a touch drag
[16:00:20] <hugo_moss> whats the difference between a touchmove and touchdrag?
[16:00:36] <Velveeta> well i say touch drag, but i'm talking about the touchmove event
[16:00:46] <hugo_moss> ok
[16:01:28] <Velveeta> man, i'm watching a man vs food episode with a milkshake challenge, and it's calling out to the fattie in me
[16:02:16] <hugo_moss> kinda hungry myself, everywhere is closed though
[16:02:41] <Velveeta> i tried to go out earlier for some brown sugar, hit up 2 different grocery stores, one of them being walmart, both were closed
[16:02:55] <hugo_moss> yea
[16:02:56] <Velveeta> i could have sworn at least walmart would be open, they'd be open during the rapture
[16:03:03] <hugo_moss> yea
[16:04:10] <Velveeta> so how about this, let's test something
[16:04:23] <Velveeta> set an event listener on body to do something like this:
[16:04:42] <Velveeta> $('body').on('testevent', function () { console.log('fired'); });
[16:04:43] <nerium> Anyone knows if it's possible to add a loading page to jquery mobile?
[16:04:58] <Velveeta> and in your touchmove event, do this: $('body').trigger('testevent');
[16:05:09] <Velveeta> and see if it'll trigger custom events during a touchmove
[16:05:35] <Velveeta> nerium: i would *think* it was, but i don't know to be honest, i don't use jquery mobile
[16:06:22] <nerium> I would be nice to have a loading page that was displayed before the actual app was displayed
[16:07:01] <nerium> it's eather that or an wierd looking page (due to the lack of css)
[16:07:15] <Velveeta> nerium: you should be able to do something like that by having your page load in a 'loading' state, and on some event, swap out the loading content for the app
[16:07:26] <Velveeta> and then whatever designates your app as being ready, trigger that event
[16:08:28] <Velveeta> maybe have the first element in the page be something like <div class="loading"></div> and make that display a loading spinner, position absolute, left/top/right/bottom 0px, and zindex 100 or something, so it hides everything else
[16:08:36] <Velveeta> and then when the app is ready, just remove that element
[16:09:02] <hugo_moss> good idea velveeta
[16:10:39] <nerium> Velveeta: That should be fairly easy, thanks!
[16:10:49] <Velveeta> nerium: don't thank me yet! :D
[16:10:54] <Velveeta> but hopefully it'll work :)
[16:30:25] <hugo_moss> velveeta, it triggers normally on touchmove, what ive found out is that, when the images are not in the viewport, and i drag upward, the console.log says the background-images have been revealed, but once in the viewport, they dont show up until i release my finger.
[16:30:26] <hugo_moss> however,
[16:30:57] <hugo_moss> if the images are already in the viewport, and i do a touchmove, they reveal fine without having to release from the screen
[16:30:57] <Velveeta> interesting
[16:31:08] <Velveeta> that's so weird
[16:31:44] <Velveeta> and you get console.logs that it's setting the background-image fine right? even in the situations where they don't show up until you release your touch?
[16:31:55] <hugo_moss> yup
[16:32:30] <Velveeta> hmmm, sounds like it may just be a quirk of ios thenâ€¦ that sucks
[16:33:50] <_cb> How would I get the option at position 1 and option at position 3 from a select using jquery?
[16:35:17] <Zuige> _cb, can you clarify
[16:35:26] <Zuige> a select db query?
[16:35:35] <Zuige> options?
[16:36:09] <_cb> From <select></select>
[16:36:10] <Velveeta> $('#someSelectElement option:eq(0), #someSelectElement option:eq(2)')
[16:36:13] <Zuige> ahh
[16:36:25] <Velveeta> i'm assuming when you say position 1 and 3, you mean first and 3rd, it's 0-indexed
[16:36:35] <Zuige> use a jquery selectors
[16:36:51] <_cb> Velveeta didn't know about :eq, googling now. Thanks!
[16:36:59] <Velveeta> :)
[16:40:00] <hugo_moss> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20693568/safari-not-loading-images-outside-viewport
[16:40:04] <hugo_moss> i found this on stackoverflow
[16:40:14] <hugo_moss> gonna try background instead of background-image
[16:44:17] <Velveeta> interesting
[16:44:33] <Velveeta> definitely let me know how it turns out, i dump out enough knowledge here, i love when i can pick up something new for myself ;)
[16:45:16] <hugo_moss> nah doesnt seem to work
[16:45:52] <hugo_moss> frustratin
[16:46:43] <Velveeta> damn
[16:47:35] <hugo_moss> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13978126/unexpected-ios-safari-behaviour-when-dynamically-updating-viewport-meta-with-jav
[17:01:06] <tieTYT2> is there a way with jquery to check if an alert is being displayed?
[17:01:19] <tieTYT2> I'm writing a unit test using qunit
[17:15:51] <shoky> tieTYT2: there isn't a way to do anything while an alert is being displayed
[17:17:22] <tieTYT2> ah so I guess this will freeze things if I ever trigger this logic
[17:17:48] <tieTYT2> maybe I'll make a function that shows the alert and mock it out for the test
[17:18:03] <shoky> that, or don't use alerts ;P
[17:18:28] <tieTYT2> don't you think alerts can be useful sometimes?
[17:18:45] <tw2113> for actually getting feedback from users, sure
[17:18:47] <tw2113> not for debugging
[17:18:58] <shoky> sure, when you're too lazy to do something proper
[17:57:21] <hugo_moss> velveeta posted on SO: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20778318/ios-iphone-4s-not-repainting-dynamic-images-that-are-initially-outside-the-viewp
[18:00:15] <gnarf> hugo_moss: have you tried just using a class?
[18:00:34] <gnarf> also, have you tried pre-loading the image asset?
[18:01:11] <gnarf> hugo_moss: 9 times out of 10 if you are doing $().css() you're doing it "wrong" better to just .addClass and change the style in the stylesheet
[18:03:01] <hugo_moss> gnarf: yea its being lazy loaded, so i set the src attribute when creating a new img object, and then do it
[18:03:07] <hugo_moss> i havent tried using a class
[18:43:37] <Velveeta> gnarf: damnit, you keep turning up since the conferenceâ€¦â€¦.. with your damn, brilliant ideas
[18:44:35] <Velveeta> yeah, hugo_moss: you could make a css class with the background-image url intact, and a default unloaded class assigned to all, and then when within range, switch to the class w/ the background url intact
[18:45:13] <Velveeta> you could specify the background-image css class name as a data parameter and say: if (within_range) { $this.addClass($this.data('imageClassName')) }
[18:45:25] <Velveeta> gnarf: you beautiful person you
[18:46:08] <gnarf> Velveeta: â™¥
[18:46:12] <Velveeta> :D
[18:46:19] <gnarf> so cheesey?
[18:46:24] <gnarf> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[18:46:34] <tw2113> you're so gouda gnarf
[18:47:10] <Velveeta> wait a minuteâ€¦.
[18:47:22] <Velveeta> DID YOU JUST CALL ME A MUCH MORE DELICIOUS STRAIN OF CHEESE?!
[18:47:38] <tw2113> did i say your irc nick?
[18:47:40] <Velveeta> and by "strain of cheese" of course, i mean *actual* cheese
[18:47:41] <mjdugan14> $(this).addClass('velvet');
[18:47:53] <Velveeta> oh wait, you said gnarf
[18:48:02] <tw2113> suck it mild chedder
[18:48:15] <tw2113> trollolololol
[18:48:24] <codepython777> is there a jquery plugin that allows all users currently on a webpage to chat with each other?
[18:48:24] <Velveeta> don't you dare call me cheddarâ€¦ that implies actual cheese, which i fall far short of
[18:48:26] <gnarf> careful, we're getting a bit to sharp tw2113
[18:48:47] <Velveeta> codepython777: any such plugin would have to run through the server, which is highly subjective, so no
[18:49:02] <Velveeta> there's no direct peer-to-peer client-side framework like that *that i know of*
[18:49:13] <gnarf> codepython777: but I imagine there is some software-as-a-service site out there that does that
[18:49:17] <codepython777> Velveeta: is there one that can do this using a server
[18:49:27] <hugo_moss> hmm, i have like 50 images that are being lazy loaded, how could i add a class with a background-image
[18:49:39] <codepython777> I was looking at togetherjs that allows this between two viewers of a webpage, but not all users
[18:49:40] <gnarf> codepython777: there is probably an open source project as well - but
[18:49:53] <tw2113> people expect so much out of javascript these days
[18:50:03] <mjdugan14> codepython777: write it in python ;)
[18:50:24] <obert_> heh
[18:50:37] <obert_> write it! def icient()!!
[18:50:52] <gnarf> hugo_moss: consider making them via the javascript, and encoding the image data itself as a data-uri?
[18:50:55] <Velveeta> hugo_moss: it's definitely a massive undertaking, something you'd want to automate as part of your build process, to construct css with your background-image properties in them
[18:51:23] <Velveeta> codepython777: i don't personally know of a client-side direct drop-in plugin type of thing that would automate it
[18:51:23] <hugo_moss> ok
[18:52:08] <hugo_moss> wait you can do that?
[18:52:14] <mjdugan14> *sigh* I hate doing the WordPress theme hunt
[18:52:15] <Velveeta> do i just went over all of our shore excursion options with my kid, for our june cruise
[18:52:16] <hugo_moss> edit the stylesheets?
[18:52:21] <Velveeta> we're now watching "titanic"
[18:52:27] <Velveeta> because that's how i roll
[18:52:36] <hugo_moss> add css classes to the stylesheets
[18:52:37] <hugo_moss> ?
[18:52:47] <hugo_moss> or id's
[18:52:50] <Velveeta> hugo_moss: you can edit stylesheets during deployment, absolutely
[18:52:57] <hugo_moss> oh ok i didnt know that
[18:53:00] <hugo_moss> ok thanks i will try that
[18:53:03] <Velveeta> you can *technically* edit them during runtime, but i don't personally advocate that
[18:53:33] <obert_> use the pycsser!!
[18:53:38] <obert_> :D
[18:53:39] <Velveeta> hugo_moss: any of the css precompilers like less, styles, scss, etc are metalanguages on top of css which are output to css at build/deploy time
[18:53:41] <gnarf> hugo_moss: you can create a style element and append it to the head and set it's content as well - but why not do it with grunt or something -- most of the code you might need to do it is probably already in grunt-icons package
[18:53:45] <gnarf> `g grunt-icons

[18:54:05] <gnarf> http://filamentgroup.com/lab/grunticon/
[18:54:06] <hugo_moss> ok

[18:54:24] <obert_> :)
[18:54:49] <obert_> what a lovely indexing
[18:56:12] <Velveeta> i'm not familiar w/ pycsser, i'll take a look
[18:56:32] <Velveeta> always on the lookout for the next bleeding edge technology that *i* can actually bring to the table at work :D
[18:56:38] <obert_> hehe i doubt it is usefull in your case
[18:56:54] <gnarf> hugo_moss: though now that I'm looking at it
[18:57:09] <gnarf> hugo_moss: why aren't you just using an <img> ?
[18:57:34] <hugo_moss> hmm but if i used less or sass, how would you automate creating the background-image classes if the image background path is retrieved through javascript
[18:58:58] <hugo_moss> well i needed to use a div, because i had done a responsive layout that resized based on percentages, and when using an img, the img height would come out to 0, but not the div, it would work on some browsers but not on others,
[18:59:08] <Velveeta> hugo_moss: you could write some kind of deployment process script to automatically dump certain db variables to your css to be interpreted by less/sass if you had to
[18:59:15] <hugo_moss> and the sizes were inherited from parent to parent to parent
[18:59:16] <Velveeta> it certainly wouldn't be easy, but it's entirely doable
[19:00:00] <g33kyboi> how do I monitor when a cross-domain iframe is opened and closed? (The Iframe is initialized with a click on a button)
[19:01:00] <Velveeta> that's outside of my current comfort zone
[19:01:16] <Velveeta> gnarf: are you guys headed to jsconf in florida in 2014?
[19:01:40] <gnarf> Velveeta: not me personally
[19:01:45] <Velveeta> booooo
[19:01:58] <gnarf> some bocouper's though
[19:02:02] <Velveeta> all you people knew each other at jqconf austin
[19:02:07] <Velveeta> i felt like the low-brain in the room
[19:02:16] <Velveeta> this was my chance to be like "hey, i know that guy!"
[19:03:01] <gnarf> hugo_moss: you could also just write stylesheets in client side js
[19:04:26] <gnarf> hugo_moss: if you have the image data, paint it on a canvas, convert it to a data uri, and write it out to a stylesheet
[19:09:30] <mjdugan14> any design junkies? I'm stuck in an internal debate of menu placement ... http://imgur.com/xYllVhm  http://imgur.com/0JJ1QBV  http://imgur.com/xYllVhm

[20:37:33] <ravigehlot> I got JSON data returning. I need to pass it to a colorbox. However, I would need to loop over the result in order to show it? Any help? I got a dump of the data
[20:39:31] <jphase> ravigehlot: you can use something like var data = $.parseJSON(yourdata); and then loop through it with $(data).each(function(){ or something
[20:40:12] <ravigehlot> jphase: hummm
[20:40:31] <ravigehlot> jphase: would this work? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18901096/click-link-to-get-json-open-ajax-results-in-colorbox-window
[20:43:26] <jphase> ravigehlot: sort of... that's a method of setting HTML to a div and then telling colorbox to render that HTML, but you're working with a JSON object so you'll have to loop through that object and append the HTML/data based on how that object is formed
[20:43:41] <shoky> ravigehlot: you want to pass it as it is?  $.getJSON('/myurl').done(function(data) {  $('#myelem').colorbox(data) })
[20:44:23] <jphase> yeah it really depends on if your JSON object is just HTML or if it's got keys and vals and such
[20:45:08] <ravigehlot> shoky: You are here!!!
[20:45:23] <shoky> not for long
[20:46:39] <ravigehlot> shoky: I am getting JSON data using .AJAX. That works. When I dump the data, it's all Objects...within the Objects I got data. I need to show that data in a colorbox.
[20:46:50] <ravigehlot> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/7t6eE/1/
[20:48:17] <shoky> ravigehlot: what does the data look like. and what do you want to pass to .colorbox exactly
[20:49:30] <ravigehlot> shoky: The JSON data that is passed is a bunch of Objects. Within each object I got fields. I have a sample dump with the JSFiddle link I sent you.
[20:49:43] <shoky> i cant access that url
[20:49:45] <ravigehlot> shoky: on the color box, I need those fields
[20:49:59] <shoky> what do you mean, you need those fields?
[20:50:00] <ravigehlot> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/7t6eE/1/
[20:50:26] <shoky> ravigehlot: there's no json there. i can't access that url you have inside
[20:50:32] <shoky> asks for user/password
[20:51:59] <shoky> ravigehlot: and if you want to change something that'll appear in the colorbox content, you'll need to change the DOM
[20:52:00] <ravigehlot> shoky: I was hoping you could shed light without having access to it
[20:52:36] <shoky> ravigehlot: shed light? without seeing what data you're talking about? nah
[20:53:24] <shoky> just a sample of the data is enough..
[20:53:48] <shoky> anyway your colorbox code is showing the element #mardigras_events_colorbox
[20:53:56] <shoky> so you'll wanna add the fields to that element, i guess
[21:35:51] <tw2113> anyone happen to know why with jQuery UI, the first item in an accordion has a really high height?
[21:43:23] <Velveeta> i guess that would depend on the accordion and the first item wouldn't it? it's not like the first item in all cases is a super high height...
[21:43:44] <Velveeta> shoky!
[21:47:52] <tw2113> paragraphs Velveeta ?
[21:48:22] <Velveeta> i'm so drunk right now, please don't rely on what i say
[22:06:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[22:06:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> the 1 day of the year where its okay for Velveeta to off game
[22:11:01] <angelazou> hi I'm have a rather strange problem
[22:11:30] <angelazou> I have some elements in the page (not injected by ajax) that I would like to do something when on clicked
[22:11:51] <angelazou> I have a console message as the notification when its clicked
[22:12:18] <angelazou> problem is, when I click it, the console message get printed like 800 times and then I get a maximum call stack size exceeded
[22:13:39] <tw2113> yo angel
[22:13:43] <tw2113> yo angelazou
[22:15:51] <angelazou> hey tw2113
[22:15:53] <angelazou> got a demo here http://jsbin.com/icosUQO/1/edit
[22:16:44] <angelazou> ahhh...is it because the event bubbled up to the div above that caused this inifinite loop?
[22:17:52] <angelazou> yeah it was...
[23:25:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyone aroudn to help
[23:25:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> got a simple question
[23:25:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> i need to resize elements as page is resized
[23:25:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> probably have to use media queries
[23:25:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> the diea is kind of like a masonary concept
[23:26:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> *idea
[23:26:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> basically as page is resized the padd between items and the size of the items are shrunk
[23:26:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> rather scaled
[23:26:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> any ideas fora  starting point
[23:26:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> maybe a snippet
