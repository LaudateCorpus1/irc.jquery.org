[02:16:14] <Woodpecker> newbie here. Please dont kill me.
[02:16:44] <Woodpecker> hat would be the best identifier for these?  https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/sZwbWXvH/
[02:17:58] <Woodpecker> I need to perform a mouse click where these paragraphs are. does that work even if they are just nested in a larger button?
[02:30:00] <pavonia> Not clear to me what you are asking
[03:31:41] <Woodpecker> pavonia: dont worry. Im just wading through this. From what I gather, you would not be able to perform a click on those <p> tags using jquery.
[03:32:35] <Woodpecker> they are nested in this div tag however :
[03:32:35] <Woodpecker> <div class="TnvOCe k6Zj8d XraQ3b" role="button" tabindex="0" jsname="n1UuX" data-profileindex="6" data-pageid="103550932009993166000">
[03:33:47] <Woodpecker> now, question is whether I can use jquery to perform a click on this div. It is unclear after reading this:
[03:33:55] <Woodpecker> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6562407/what-does-role-button-mean
[03:40:00] <pavonia> Woodpecker: You can add event handlers to the surrounding div and also to the individual paragraphs. Have you looked at http://api.jquery.com/on/ ?
[03:41:11] <Woodpecker> pavonia: even though I am web scraping? And no I havnt. I will take a look.
[03:42:10] <pavonia> How is web scraping related here?
[03:45:26] <Woodpecker> pavonia: I might be using the term wrong, but I am loading a google account selection page, and I just want to click one of the options (see screenshot). Google throws a ton of gobbly gook in their html to make it more difficult. https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/BpMIbO1o/image.png
[03:49:46] <pavonia> You can't add it to the existing page, I guess
[03:50:22] <pavonia> I have to go anyway. Bye!
[03:50:41] <Woodpecker> pavonia: Right. Now I know that
[03:50:43] <Woodpecker> thanks
[08:00:29] <anli> Why cant I walk the element.offsetParent() chain until element.length == 0?
[08:00:42] <anli> Is the root element its own offset parent?
[08:35:57] <joja> hi everyone! i can t find a way to get the following to work: i want to change the src of an img and am doing this with attr('href', myVar) - the variable i have set before and it works fine BUT the problem is i call this through an .each function for multiple containers ... and therefore i would need to change the var name, because now all the containers get the same img src obviously ... and not the one from their own container.
[08:36:11] <joja> is this understandable what i am trying to do?
[08:40:35] <joja> https://jsfiddle.net/68vtpjgu/2/
[08:40:48] <joja> this is the structure i use
[08:41:29] <joja> with multiple containers though
[14:17:28] <dw1> i want to set a class on body when modals are shown. .on('show' or .on('hidden' don't seem to work for jquery 3.3.1. any recommendations?
[14:17:56] <dw1> must i hard code it before every show
[14:18:22] * dw1 hates having unnecessary brackets and one extra line of code :P
[14:23:18] <dw1> fine ill just add it to the .show and .hide callbacks
[14:26:42] <dw1> weird, that made them animate differently
[14:27:57] <dw1> apparently the default was 0 then went to 400 :S
[14:32:46] <dw1> see https://jsfiddle.net/cz569pwt/2/
[14:32:54] <dw1> default isn't 400 without paramters :S
[14:35:10] <dw1> so docs are wrong
[19:07:28] <indigoblue> Hey yall. I'm currently using animate and scrollTop: $("#elementID").offset().top
[19:07:41] <indigoblue> This works fine for the first few divs I create and scroll to,
[19:08:22] <indigoblue> but after about the fifth of sixth generated div, the scroll behavior breaks down and the scrollTop feature begins to erroneously scroll to incorrect areas of the screen whenever I issue the command.
[19:08:51] <indigoblue> Curiously enough, the regular scroll behavior is resumed when I scroll to the top of the page and then issue the scrollTop/animate command.
[19:08:57] <indigoblue> I will scroll to the correct section.
[19:09:25] <indigoblue> But if the page is near the halfway mark or further down, it will begin to erroneously scroll to another section.
[19:09:33] <indigoblue> Can anybody here tell me why this might be?
[19:10:26] <indigoblue> i'm passing the function the correct div/ID, and as far as I can tell there are no duplicate IDs. So I can't see a reason why it would scroll to another div
[19:11:46] <indigoblue> i think it might because my scrolling section is INSIDE another div?
[19:11:49] <indigoblue> might be*
[19:12:43] <indigoblue> nvm, I think i got it.
[19:12:46] <indigoblue> rubberduck for the win
