[00:17:25] <sachinaddy> *facing.
[00:19:46] <VectorX> hi, there is an autocomplete in the search area on this page, http://bit.ly/1ucnu2W  can someone tell me where i can find the code for it, i looked the .js files but cant seem to locate it
[00:35:07] <Lurzino> Hello everyone!!!! :-)))))
[00:35:15] <Lurzino> I have this sidebar.php code at http://pastebin.com/JrzvuF6b (obviously <script> and <style> are really respectively in a js file and in a css file)... just I am trying to clone and append the template inside <aside> but seems still invisible when it should be visible... why? any trick would be appreciated thanks :)
[00:46:32] <Lurzino> I have this sidebar.php code at http://pastebin.com/JrzvuF6b (obviously <script> and <style> are really respectively in a js file and in a css file)... just I am trying to clone and append the template inside <aside> but seems still invisible when it should be visible... why? any trick would be appreciated thanks :) the weird thing is if I remove the display:none then the clone().appendTo('aside') works and I can see the div...
[00:47:08] <sachinaddy> Plz someone help me regarding how to exclude weekends from jquery?
[00:47:16] <sachinaddy> jquery countdown
[01:05:42] <naprac> how can i play an 1sec audio tag so that it plays on every say 15 secs and waits for 3 sec?
[01:06:35] <naprac> i know how to play it on every 15 sec but don't know how to add a pause into it?
[01:39:19] <eskatrem> Hey, if I have a text area, can I show the cursor position on it *when it is not selected*?
[01:43:06] <beancurd> pretty sure you can do a .hover() on a text area, then do something if this not focus or something.
[01:45:41] <eskatrem> beancurd: ok, thanks, trying .hover() now
[01:55:07] <eskatrem> Yeah no, .hover is not what I want. I want to be able to display the cursor as if my text area was selected, even when it is not.
[01:56:59] <Cork> eskatrem: that depends on the system
[01:57:52] <eskatrem> Cork: the browser, you mean?
[01:58:03] <Cork> eskatrem: the browser and os
[01:58:09] <FilipNortic> if I try and set the value attribute for some elment that isn't suppuse to have it like an <a> tag and then want to access it am I down some pit fall of bad practice?
[01:58:39] <eskatrem> Cork: oh boy, I don't feel like going down that road.
[01:59:10] <Cork> eskatrem: for example in linux (firefox and chrome) it does what you talk about by default
[01:59:55] <Cork> FilipNortic: never ever EVER set unprefixed random values on dom elements
[02:00:00] <Cork> FilipNortic: use data-value
[02:00:07] <Cork> data- is specifically meant for random extra data
[02:00:13] <eskatrem> Cork: no, I am running Chrome on debian and I don't see the cursor when my text area is not selected.
[02:02:17] <Lurzino> Hello Cork
[02:03:06] <Cork> o/
[02:03:14] <Lurzino> I tried that you suggested yesterday and you can see the code at http://pastebin.com/JrzvuF6b but it didn't worked...still remains invisible...
[02:05:58] <Lurzino> (obviously I changed div to aside but nothing)
[02:08:12] <Cork> Lurzino: doesn't look like you clone the content
[02:08:29] <Cork> so it stays inside the template element
[02:08:53] <Cork> i can only guess though as it isn't running code
[02:09:53] <Lurzino> hold on.. I missed something in the pastebin... the piece of aside container
[02:12:56] <Lurzino> There you go Cork  http://pastebin.com/icGkKGvr , here you can see also the <aside> tags
[02:13:38] <Lurzino> as you can see the sidebar-template is invisible so I clone it and append with $('#sidebar-template').clone().appendTo('aside');
[02:13:39] <Cork> Lurzino: the aside doesn't have any special meaning
[02:14:04] <Cork> ah
[02:14:07] <Lurzino> yeah but I tried so following your jsfiddle sample to see if it would work
[02:14:12] <Cork> i thought you meant for the dialog
[02:14:28] <eskatrem> I tried to run $("#my-input").trigger("click") to show the cursor on that element - basically what I want is to simulate a click - but nothing happens/
[02:14:36] <Lurzino> no, the dialog is only an independent dialog window
[02:14:46] <Lurzino> which would be opened from js
[02:15:16] <Cork> Lurzino: inspect the cloned element and see what hids it
[02:15:45] <Cork> Lurzino: if you want me to help you need to make a live example
[02:15:52] <Cork> it isn't possible to debug dead code
[02:16:36] <jop008> hi firends I have a listview question this is my code http://pastebin.com/4sLpMhGf the list is shown but I can not search at the top of the list
[02:18:06] <Lurzino> Cork ok in a few I'll make a live sample
[02:25:40] <roxlu> hi guys, does someone knows if el.html('<h3>title</h3><p>test</p>'); works on IE8 ?
[02:26:35] <DeafGoose> does anybody know of a js slider with multiple images on the page similar to this? http://screencast.com/t/hXqf0XC7
[02:33:45] <brunoais> roxlu, why do you want to do like that?
[02:37:14] <roxlu> brunoais: I'm working on a survey result website where the user can filter the results; some of the results also change some HTML/text which is stored in a DB.
[02:37:34] <roxlu> brunoais: I could completely refresh the page, but I wanted to only update the elements which actually change
[02:37:52] <brunoais> why won't you just do that?
[02:38:09] <brunoais> make the individual elements add the attributes then place them in the DOM :)
[02:39:03] <roxlu> brunoais: what do you mean why? I mean using el.html(data.title); is a lot easier then generating all the separate HTML elements.
[02:39:45] <brunoais> suit yourself
[02:39:55] <brunoais> the maintainability is the one that suffers, though
[02:40:27] <roxlu> brunoais: I didn't ask for another solution, I asked if .html() would work in IE8. But I guess you meant to say "no it doesn't work in IE8" I guess
[02:40:42] <systemfault> roxlu: Why wouldn't it?
[02:40:47] <systemfault> roxlu: Have you tried it?
[02:41:06] <brunoais> roxlu, I'm trying to prevent you from reaching the hard to maintain code.
[02:41:39] <Cork> roxlu: .html() is just some wrapping around innerHTML so yes it should work fine in ie4 even
[02:41:42] <roxlu> brunoais: how is creating lots and lots of js code to generate html elements less work then using the html() function ?
[02:41:49] * roxlu really curious
[02:41:57] <systemfault> roxlu: Flexibility.
[02:42:25] <brunoais> roxlu, easier to read and more direct to understand what the "%$%"$ is happening there
[02:42:32] <Cork> creating the elements separately is slower though
[02:42:38] <Cork> quite a bit too
[02:42:40] <brunoais> Cork, that depends
[02:42:49] <roxlu> brunoais: your solution is not flexible at all
[02:42:49] <Cork> brunoais: no it actually doesn't :)
[02:42:59] <brunoais> really?
[02:43:04] <Cork> brunoais: yes
[02:43:05] <systemfault> roxlu: And doing something like foo.html('<h3>' + title + '</h3><p>' + content + '</p>'); isn't that much longer.
[02:43:08] <brunoais> are jsperf tests wrong there too?
[02:43:15] <roxlu> Cork: thanks, I did remember that IE had problems with generating option elements
[02:43:16] <Cork> cause innerHTML uses the stream parser in the browser
[02:43:20] <frank_o> http://drum.rory.ie/ js drum machine lol
[02:43:26] <Cork> so you hit a fast track
[02:43:29] <roxlu> brunoais: no I'm doing: foo.html(data.title)
[02:43:39] <systemfault> Cork: I've seen the opposite, creating nodes one by one is a LOT faster than innerHTML.
[02:43:59] <systemfault> Cork: innerHTML used to be super fast back in the days when JS was slow
[02:44:17] <Cork> systemfault: that sounds weird
[02:44:58] <frank_o> so do the example drum loops in that drum machine
[02:45:43] <brunoais> there are many tests but it is hard to find a good one
[02:45:46] <frank_o> but damn all the things you can do with js these days
[02:46:41] <systemfault> brunoais: Yeah… tons of bad tests on jsperf
[02:47:19] <frank_o> http://emberbeats.gavinjoyce.com/#/song/N4IgdghgtgpiBcIDKMAeBXCAbABACRmwEswBzHACgFkIAnANxJwHEIBPGAShABoQAXGFAAOAewQBOAKx8AxgAsIYMDCwBnBAG1Qa0ejAATBCADWRWSd4h6orOlgIAjHzWDhG%2BNuurRsovzYnAF8eUHofPwCEAAYQsIj%2FQPhY0O8sX0SYuLSMqOTs8PTIpJT4osz81MLcpMcChLzogDopevLGtprgqoaSzuLusq7KoYGRnLG6nvba%2ForSifm5junhheqx9d6s1cnlvt2lw5XRo9OTxYuNs8vZgF1s3X0jRDVIWjg%2BGzsHeGcQVwwdxac4HUE7cHja5XbZQ2FbGYQ25I6Fg5FwxHJFr7QbohFrHEYgnHNGolHwwn4zaUynYkkxOmQqkVKZMwmsvG0
[02:47:26] <frank_o> sorry y'all
[02:48:09] <frank_o> didnt realize it was that massive
[02:49:20] <brunoais> this one seems decent: http://jsperf.com/innerhtml-vs-createelement-and-appendchild/5
[02:49:33] <brunoais> in my browser, 2nd one wins
[02:50:03] <brunoais> oh wait. 3rd test is not valid
[02:51:56] <Cork> brunoais: http://jsperf.com/innerhtml-vs-createelement-and-appendchild/25
[02:52:06] <Cork> line 1 wins here
[02:52:13] <Cork> not but very much though
[02:53:32] <systemfault> Cork: The use case is unrealistic though… why would you use pure dom instead of innerHTML and build it node by node if the content is "static"
[02:53:42] <brunoais> Cork, 2nd one wins with me. 74K vs 85K
[02:54:10] <Cork> systemfault: ya, i agree
[02:54:35] <Cork> it also creates contexts and things it shouldn't test so ya...
[02:55:06] <brunoais> thamn!
[02:55:10] <brunoais> another broken test
[02:55:16] <brunoais> but I think I can do something usable from it
[02:55:31] <Cork> but i wonder why my chrome performs so horribly bad on that test...
[02:55:36] <Cork> *chromium
[02:55:48] <Cork> ~13,805
[02:55:58] <Cork> its around 6 times too low
[02:56:06] <brunoais> weird
[02:57:31] <systemfault> On my side.. for some reason, the number is higher on the second test but the first one "wins" (it's green)
[02:58:12] <sachinaddy> Can someone tell me please how to call two functions parallel in jquery. I m able to call one function.
[02:58:34] <Cork> systemfault: depends on the flux in the tests (the second number)
[02:58:35] <systemfault> sachinaddy: You can't do anything in parallel with JS. Please explain your problem.
[02:59:06] <Cork> sachinaddy: js is single threaded, so ya; not possible
[02:59:25] <Cork> you can use webworkers or make the code async
[02:59:35] <sachinaddy> ok systemfault, a moment please..
[03:00:14] <sachinaddy> so cork, is there any alternative method?
[03:00:25] <Cork> sachinaddy: the two i gave you
[03:00:46] <Cork> sachinaddy: you can make the code async by using setTimeout or sendMessage
[03:01:02] <Cork> or you can start a thread as a webworker
[03:01:06] <Cork> ?mdn webworker
[03:01:07] <b-ot> Cork: Using web workers - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Performance/Using_web_workers
[03:01:13] <brunoais> Cork, in that test, the code to remove nodes is wrong. It is assuming it is a static list, not a dynamic list... Sigh...
[03:02:20] <sachinaddy> Cork, shall I pastebin my source code to you? Just have a look.
[03:02:35] <sachinaddy> Can you tell how to start webworker
[03:14:45] <brunoais> Cork, http://jsperf.com/innerhtml-vs-createelement-and-appendchild/27
[03:14:51] <brunoais> does this seem a well made test to you?
[03:23:38] <systemfault> brunoais: Was using document.createTextNode and parentCreate.firstChild slower?
[03:24:15] <systemfault> Because the usual loop is while(parentCreate.firstChild) { parentCreate.removeChild(parentCreate.firstChild); }
[03:24:16] <brunoais> createTextNode method is slower than using textContent
[03:24:22] <systemfault> Ah ok, good to know
[03:24:38] <brunoais> it is just more flexible in specific situations
[03:25:23] <brunoais> systemfault, ^
[03:25:39] <uskerine> hi, i would like to add a link/button to remove the current row from a datatables. Any idea on how to detect which is the current row?
[03:31:45] <cubud> Hi all
[03:32:26] <cubud> I have an event object from a click event. It is triggered by a <th>, how do I find the owning table?
[03:33:08] <systemfault> cubud: $(this).closest('table')
[03:34:09] <cubud> Will $(this) be set to the <th> that triggered the event then?
[03:35:01] <systemfault> Yes
[03:36:22] <frosch> Hi! Does jQuery.Event support the creation of custom keydown events where some modifier key is set (not just the keyCode/which property)? For example Ctrl+Shift+s. Is there another way to simulate such an event?
[03:37:53] <decx> should only be in keypress
[03:37:58] <cubud> That's fantastic, thanks very much!
[03:39:07] <cubud> I see that calling toggle() on the table's tbody will fade it out and then resize the table - is there a way to make both happen at the same time?
[03:49:13] <uskerine> should this work inside an <a> tag?
[03:49:14] <uskerine> $('#newInvoiceListTable .deleteRow').click( function () {
[03:49:26] <uskerine> a has class deleteRow
[04:00:08] <cubud> Thanks systemfault
[04:24:07] <Snoopal> hey guys. im loading images via ajax. now i want them to be preloaded and after they are preloaded i want to be displayed. everything is fine but i dont know how i can find out when images are preloaded
[04:25:23] <papifabi> Snoopal> with load?
[04:25:35] <papifabi> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1977871/check-if-an-image-is-loaded-no-errors-in-javascript
[04:26:04] <Snoopal> wait i ll show you how i load the images
[04:26:42] <Snoopal> http://jsfiddle.net/77xu2/
[04:26:58] <Snoopal> what i do: i have an array which has the urls for each image
[04:27:05] <Snoopal> with image.src i try to preload them
[04:27:34] <Snoopal> my problem is now that i dont know when preload is done
[04:27:51] <papifabi> images[i].onload() ?
[04:30:47] <Snoopal> hmmm
[04:30:52] <papifabi> ?
[04:32:11] <Snoopal> just try to figure out how i could check easly if all images are loaded
[04:32:39] <papifabi> with a count
[04:32:48] <decx> you count all your images and for every load event you get you know one is loaded, when all are loaded then it's done
[04:33:23] <Snoopal> sounds like a plan! :)
[04:33:27] <Snoopal> thx
[04:34:11] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/QsLqw/ threw it together
[04:34:53] <papifabi> +1
[04:35:22] <Snoopal> thanks decx
[04:39:55] <papifabi> what do you think of w2ui lib gor GUI ?
[04:40:00] <papifabi> *for
[04:43:19] <VectorX> when clicking on a link on tha page, i need to display an elegant popup with some sublinks, should have a close button to close it, just want to get some suggestions if anyone seen some nice ones
[04:50:35] <md1985> Hi trying to get 2 data items var posTop ='352';  var posBottom = '471'; into a string like this '352,471' can anyone point me in the right place?
[04:51:07] <decx> posTop+','+posBottom
[04:57:53] <Cork> md1985: or [posTop, posBottom].join(',')
[04:58:18] <md1985> Cork: yeah tried that and it seemed to work fine
[04:58:35] <md1985> also decx that worked too
[05:04:36] <Mateo_> Hi everyone !
[05:04:47] <brunoais> hi
[05:09:00] <Mateo_> I have some trouble with jquery mobile. The behaviour of my listview is strange. It’s hard to scroll, it often opens the element instead of just scrolling
[05:09:05] <Mateo_> Is that a common issue ?
[05:09:42] <Mateo_> The webapp is tried on ios, on an iPhone5
[05:09:55] <Mateo_> as an app with phonegap
[05:24:33] <ph88> why doesn't jQuery give me a clean array here??    var selected = this.$el.find('input[class="subscribed"]:checked').map(function() {	return $(this).val();	});
[05:31:08] <decx> no idea but why are you using an attribute selector for a class
[05:32:01] <Cork> ph88: cause your using .map instead of $.map
[05:32:20] <decx> oh right this is backbone isnt it
[05:32:22] <Cork> ph88: $.map(this.$el.find('input[class="subscribed"]:checked'), function() { return $(this).val(); });
[05:32:53] <Cork> but ya input[class="subscribed"] looks wrong
[05:33:07] <Cork> should be input.subscribed
[05:53:05] <linux_daemon> totally different question: anyone knows what does 80% efficiency on a psu stands for? or at least point me on some usefull link...cause on google i found some technical data i dont understand...
[05:55:08] <brunoais> linux_daemon, are you sure that's a javascript question?
[05:55:33] <slax0r> brunoais: sure it is
[05:55:35] <linux_daemon> well i said on the beginning: totally different question...
[05:55:36] <slax0r> every JS has a psu
[05:55:36] <decx> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80_Plus
[05:55:50] <linux_daemon> decx, red it, cant understand it..
[05:56:06] <decx> marketing
[05:57:01] <linux_daemon> what i wanna know is: the total wattage of the components is ~380W, is a psu with 500W power and 80% efficiency enough for the system?
[05:57:31] <linux_daemon> thats the only thing
[05:58:39] <linux_daemon> cant find a darn nicely explained article on it...
[05:59:10] <slax0r> http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalculatorlite.jsp
[05:59:38] <slax0r> if this is a gaming setup, go for at least 750W
[05:59:41] <slax0r> you wont regret it later
[05:59:57] <slax0r> when you'll pop-in a second gfx card
[06:00:05] <slax0r> which you sooner or later will
[06:00:15] <slax0r> but srsly...javascript/jquery
[06:00:54] <linux_daemon> thanks slax0r...its not a gaming machine...
[06:08:20] <Lindrian> Does jquery cache the result of .find() and similar things?
[06:10:43] <aleray> hi, do you now any plugin like http://nicolasbize.com/magicsuggest/doc.html that doesn't require bootstrap? I'm mentioning this one because it allows for forbiding free entries
[06:10:45] <Cork> Lindrian: no you cache it by storing the result in a variable and reusing it
[06:11:16] <aleray> I'm looking for a widget that could help to build a list of existing users (to set permissions on a wiki)
[06:11:28] <Lindrian> Cork: alright..
[06:47:03] <cubud> jsfiddle.net website is great! :)
[06:47:30] <Cork> cubud: it is a bit buggy, but ya it is nice
[06:47:43] <ph88> thank you cork !
[06:47:46] <Cork> (especially selecting and copying text is buggy)
[06:47:58] <cubud> Can anyone tell me why clicking on something other than the popup window does not cause the alert to execute? http://jsfiddle.net/gMwfg/
[06:48:10] <Cork> ph88: np
[06:48:15] <ph88> Cork: what good is .map() then? if i have to use $.map() instead? it would have been nice to chain here
[06:49:07] <Cork> ph88: $().map(function() { return $(this).find('a').addBack().first(); }).show()
[06:49:11] <Cork> or something like that
[06:49:36] <Cork> ph88: basically if you want to build a jquery selection and run jquery functions on it
[06:50:20] <Cork> actually
[06:50:31] <Cork> ph88: $().map(function() { return $(this).data('ref'); }).show()
[06:50:35] <Cork> is prob a better example
[06:50:57] <ph88> Cork: yes i think i understand ... first you transform it with map()  but then you still want to chain it with jQuery  ... ok thx Cork
[06:51:10] <Cork> ph88: well no not really
[06:51:19] <Cork> it is for when you want to build a list of dom elements
[06:51:53] <Cork> where you can't really do it in one straight daisy chain
[06:51:54] <ph88> Cork: i think it's the same as $($.map())
[06:52:00] <Cork> ph88: it is
[06:52:14] <ph88> :P
[06:52:29] <Cork> but you asked what it was good for
[06:52:34] <Cork> not what it actually does :)
[06:52:48] <ph88> :P
[06:54:21] <cubud> If someone could take a look at the URL I pasted I'd really appreciate it
[06:54:34] <Cork> opps
[06:54:34] <ph88> Cork: do you use underscore sometimes ?
[06:54:34] <cubud> I am too much of a JQuery newbie to know
[06:54:51] <Cork> ph88: i do, but not often
[06:55:07] <ph88> ok cool .. i noticed function like .map are everywhere now :P
[06:55:25] <ph88> cubud: which popup window ?
[06:56:12] <cubud> If you click the (1) then one will pop up, click (2) and it will disappear and a new one will pop up, but when you click (3) I would expect an alert
[06:56:43] <Cork> cubud: you mean the fadeout handler?
[06:56:48] <ph88> cubud: tables in tables is not so nice .. but ok i'll have a look
[06:57:10] <Cork> uh sorry
[06:57:12] <Cork> focusout
[06:59:01] <Cork> cubud: also you bind the click handler on the popup too
[06:59:08] <Cork> so if you click it it will hide the popup
[06:59:13] <Cork> is that intentional?
[06:59:23] <ph88> cubud: i think the .popupInformation gets focus when you click on it, so it never has focus in the first place, so focusout doesn't work
[06:59:35] <kylerivers> Hello!  I would like to find a way manipulate rows (or list items) where they would automatically re-sort pr re-order themselves.  I have see where they can be manually re-sorted or re-ordered by the user, but I am looking for a way to do this automatically (onload or looping).  Any pointers on this would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!
[06:59:37] <Cork> no nothing gets focus
[06:59:43] <Cork> td doesn't keep focus
[06:59:52] <Cork> neither does table
[07:00:03] <ph88> i thought everything in html could get focus ^^
[07:00:14] <ph88> kylerivers: try jQuery datatables
[07:00:21] <Cork> only links, object, embed iframe and form elements
[07:00:37] <ph88> right ^^
[07:00:45] <Cork> hmm not sure about video and audio actually
[07:01:01] <cubud> In that case how would I detect that the user has interacted with another part of the page so that I can fade out the popup?
[07:01:40] <Cork> cubud: answer the other question first
[07:01:55] <Cork> cubud: also you bind the click handler on the popup too <--
[07:02:01] <Cork> so if you click it it will hide the popup <--
[07:02:04] <kylerivers> ph88: Thanks.   Any particular link, function
[07:02:13] <Cork> cubud: is that intentional?
[07:02:22] <cubud> Sorry, missed that. Click once it will show, click again it will hide, click another it will hide, click anything else at all it should hide
[07:02:35] <cubud> click twice = show then hide, click anywhere else = hide
[07:02:43] <Cork> and if you click the popup?
[07:02:59] <ph88> kylerivers: https://datatables.net/
[07:03:27] <cubud> it should hide
[07:03:31] <ph88> cubud: sounds like after popup has opened, just clicking anything should close the popup
[07:03:43] <cubud> ph88, that is exactly what I am trying to achieve
[07:04:00] <Cork> cubud: ok
[07:04:24] <ph88> cubud: i think for that you can do $(document).on('click', function() { $('.hasPopupInformation').fadeOut(); })
[07:04:51] <cubud> ah, I will try
[07:05:29] <ph88> perhaps you need to put a test in there if the popup is already visible or not
[07:05:33] <Cork> cubud: give me a min and i will give you a more optimized version
[07:05:45] <ph88> cubud: go to Cork for the more optimized version ;)
[07:05:52] <cubud> many thanks!
[07:06:05] <Cork> cubud: also you should prob try to update to moteratly modern version of jquery :)
[07:06:09] <Cork> 1.8 is quite old
[07:06:40] <cubud> Yes, I should really :)
[07:08:02] <cubud> I need to do the school run, will be back soon and read up for your reply :)
[07:12:02] <Cork> cubud: http://jsfiddle.net/gMwfg/1/
[07:12:30] <Cork> i THINK that should work as you want
[07:12:40] <BillCriswell> Very few things make me feel as dumb as Drupal.
[07:12:52] <BillCriswell> For even common shit.
[07:12:53] <Cork> BillCriswell: lol i feel you ^^
[07:14:16] <BillCriswell> Cork: How did a client ever log into the admin and not say "Please redo it".
[07:14:39] <Cork> XD
[07:14:40] <BillCriswell> s/ever/never
[07:14:55] <Cork> BillCriswell: they made a class like implementation pre php5
[07:15:02] <Cork> and it still follows that structure
[07:15:15] <Cork> so it is a bit mind warping
[07:16:00] <ph88> which version of drupal are you guys talking about ?
[07:16:03] <BillCriswell> Cork: It's brutal.
[07:16:11] <ph88> Drutal !
[07:16:13] <BillCriswell> ph88: 7.
[07:16:16] <Cork> ph88: history
[07:16:24] <Cork> i haven't used drupal much after 6
[07:16:27] <ph88> have you guys checked out Drupal 8 yet ?
[07:16:41] <BillCriswell> It's an admin only a programmer could love.
[07:16:46] <Cork> i only manage one drupal site now days
[07:16:51] <BillCriswell> so maybe I am not a programmer.
[07:16:51] <Cork> and it is still drupal 6
[07:16:56] <Cork> so no 8 here :)
[07:17:14] <BillCriswell> I hear 8 won't be ready for public for quite some time.
[07:17:50] <ph88> i checked it out the other day .. it runs and looks good .. but there is really nothing to find ... no themes, no modules, no manual, no nothing ... but it runs !
[07:18:10] <ph88> oh and they have yet to do the caching implementation on the backend (which is somethign you really want)
[07:19:08] <axilla> hi all, i'm trying to scale the size of a div based on height width percentage on button click(zoom in/zoom out).. can anyone tell me why this wouldn't be working.. what am i doing wrong here? i'm trying to increment the width of the background-size onclick https://gist.github.com/travisdmathis/ad1369870cdf8e501127
[07:21:48] <BillCriswell> axilla: Just use 100, not '100'. Also, you probably need a space before "auto".
[07:22:13] <axilla> BillCriswell: also would i say width ++ 5 or width + 5?
[07:22:15] <axilla> in JS?
[07:22:17] <BillCriswell> It's also kind of confusing to have $width since it's not a jQuery object, I'd just name it width.
[07:22:36] <BillCriswell> axilla: You can do width += 5 if you want.
[07:22:41] <axilla> i can just say var width = 100?
[07:22:46] <BillCriswell> axilla: Yes.
[07:22:59] <axilla> cool :) thx, just really diving deep into JS/Jquery
[07:23:14] <decx> "deep" ^^
[07:23:17] <BillCriswell> axilla: The biggest issue is the: $width + 'auto !important'); part.
[07:23:37] <BillCriswell> Right now it's setting CSS like background-size: 105pxauto !important;
[07:23:38] <axilla> decx: lol
[07:23:50] <BillCriswell> Actually, it's not even setting the px.
[07:23:52] <kylerivers> ph88:  I am not sure I am seeing what I need... can you throw me a bone?
[07:23:55] <BillCriswell> You'll need to add this as well.
[07:23:59] <decx> dont forget to use your cached $folder_image var
[07:24:09] <decx> instead of looking for it again
[07:24:16] <BillCriswell> axilla: $width + 'px auto !important';
[07:24:25] <axilla> ahh yea
[07:24:43] <BillCriswell> Having a number as a string is just asking for some hurting.
[07:25:01] <ph88> kylerivers: do you have your pedigree ?
[07:25:05] <BillCriswell> '100' + 5 = '1005', not 105 liek you'd expect.
[07:25:33] <decx> that's why i always - 0 first ;) /jk
[07:25:44] <ph88> kylerivers: what exactly are you looking for and can't find ?
[07:26:01] <Cork> BillCriswell, axilla: also !important is pointless in .css() calls
[07:26:26] <Cork> if a css rule uses !important then your later and lose (can't set anything)
[07:26:27] <axilla> hmmm
[07:26:32] <Cork> if nothing is using !imporant
[07:26:36] <BillCriswell> Cork: If he has an !important in the stylesheet it might not be?
[07:26:39] <Cork> then your inline so you always win
[07:26:52] <Cork> BillCriswell: no the stylesheet will win as it sets it first
[07:27:04] <axilla> yea, i think that's whats happening
[07:27:06] <BillCriswell> Ah, luckily never needed to do that.
[07:27:27] <Cork> basically, never use !important unless you want to make sure nothing can't ever change it
[07:27:36] <Cork> *can ever
[07:28:15] <Cork> most use of !important should be handled by either a rule defined later in the stylesheet
[07:28:20] <Cork> or a more specific selector
[07:28:28] <Cork> so you rarely need !important
[07:29:36] <kylerivers> ph88: I am looking for jquery or javascript that will allow me to create a re-ordering or resorting effect…  If you took the Sortable effect and made it automated in a loop basically - http://jqueryui.com/sortable/
[07:29:48] <kylerivers> My pedigree is not very impressive
[07:29:51] <kylerivers> :-)
[07:30:43] <ph88> kylerivers: ye oops that link i gave you is not really suitable .. i misunderstood your first question
[07:30:47] <decx> huh
[07:30:59] <kylerivers> ok
[07:31:01] <decx> like an automated sort animation?
[07:31:04] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/pp5ae/
[07:31:08] <kylerivers> thx… I was scratchging my head
[07:31:21] <Bloomberg> why when I put something in ths ajaxStop repeat the fnction many times
[07:31:23] <Bloomberg> ?
[07:31:31] <cubud> Many thanks Cork !
[07:31:38] <Cork> cubud: np
[07:31:39] <hxm> hello, is that possible to interact with popups? I want to open a popup, then login facebook or twitter and come back with the auth session
[07:32:09] <ph88> kylerivers: i think you just have to order the items yourself and possibly re-apply the .sortable plugin
[07:32:59] <kylerivers> but that does not seem like it would do the trick… achiveing an automated effect
[07:33:06] <kylerivers> looping I guess
[07:33:43] <heythere> hey guys i need to pass with beforesend: function 2 headers to an $ajax request... but it seems like I cant rly figure out whats the syntax for it
[07:33:50] <BillCriswell> Can you ever use important in .css() ?
[07:34:56] <Cork> BillCriswell: you can but it won't have any effect
[07:35:04] <Cork> it won't make the value invalid
[07:35:05] <ph88> kylerivers: so you want to take the position of all elements and then for each of them at the same time have a move animation to their new position ... i don't think that's in the sortable plugin perhaps try another plugin
[07:35:06] <BillCriswell> Cork: I don't even think jQuery sets it.
[07:35:11] <Cork> it dosen't
[07:35:18] <Cork> or actually...
[07:35:41] <decx> BillCriswell didnt you think of a usecase already? when your stylesheet has !important but you must override?
[07:35:53] <decx> and what do you mean it wont have an effect Cork?
[07:35:59] <kylerivers> ph88:  That's fine, can you make any recommendation??
[07:36:09] <ph88> kylerivers: this is how someone solved this problem from outsite jQuery UI sortable http://stackoverflow.com/a/12113159
[07:36:47] <Cork> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/9bQyt/
[07:36:48] <kylerivers> Oh great.  This looks like it could work'
[07:36:51] <BillCriswell> Cork: http://jsbin.com/katelaqi/2/edit?css,js,output This worked.
[07:36:53] <Cork> i actually spoke too soon
[07:37:02] <kylerivers> Thanks!  I will test it out!
[07:37:15] <BillCriswell> Cork: Yeah something didn't feel right about that so I had to test it haha.
[07:37:31] <decx> how is that a mystery? am i taking crazy pills here?
[07:37:35] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/35bKB/
[07:37:47] <BillCriswell> decx: This conversation isn't happening.

[07:38:13] <decx> i'm mad as hell and i won't take it anymore
[07:38:20] <decx> !!!1
[07:38:21] <BillCriswell> decx: Relax howard.
[07:38:49] <BillCriswell> His name is Howard in Network right?
[07:38:53] <BillCriswell> or am I making that up?
[07:39:02] <decx> i have no idea where the quote is coming from
[07:39:07] <decx> cultural osmosis
[07:39:41] <BillCriswell> decx: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS4aiA17YsM
[07:40:51] <Cork> BillCriswell: this one is a bit interesting http://jsfiddle.net/9bQyt/1/
[07:40:59] <Cork> so you can modify the style attribute
[07:41:08] <Cork> but not use the style property to do it >_<
[07:41:19] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/pp5ae/
[07:41:21] <BillCriswell> Cork: Hahaha
[07:41:43] <Cork> BillCriswell: so apparently jquery has a hack where it modifies the string
[07:41:47] <Bloomberg> the ajaxStop create a loop in the function
[07:41:57] <Cork> haven't seen that one as i've looked through the code
[07:42:13] <decx> ok now i can act smug when i use the quote BillCriswell thx :>
[07:42:26] <BillCriswell> decx: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxiT30N6ti4 this one is a lot better in my opinion
[07:42:44] <BillCriswell> Cork: Hopefully we never have to touch it haha
[07:43:04] <Cork> ya, the base statement still stands
[07:43:04] <BillCriswell> decx: Get the chills during that one.
[07:43:08] <Cork> "don't use !important"
[07:43:18] <decx> shit, i need one of those giant dimlit corporate meeting rooms with the tiny lamps on a long table
[07:43:57] <decx> only to say: this is the warroom, you can't fight here

[07:45:55] <decx> great scene, i'll have to watch that movie
[07:46:22] <BillCriswell> Get your name on The List with me! haha
[07:49:41] <Bloomberg> Instead to be fighting someone can help me!!
[07:49:44] <Bloomberg> s.o.s
[07:49:46] <Bloomberg> plz
[07:50:03] <BillCriswell> Now I'm watching Murrow speeches.
[07:51:12] <ph88> Bloomberg: what's up ?
[07:51:30] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/pp5ae/
[07:51:58] <Bloomberg> in the ajaxStop when I try of to do a post function creates a loop and repeat it many times
[07:53:39] <ph88> don't see any ajaxStop anywhere
[07:54:14] <Bloomberg> yes there I have comment it
[07:54:22] <Bloomberg> because creates a loop
[07:54:45] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/pp5ae/1/
[07:54:49] <Bloomberg> now is this
[07:55:52] <ph88> Bloomberg: oh it's a plugin ... i don't know about that plugin ^^
[07:56:42] <Bloomberg> ph88 : Is weird because, if I do just an alert works ok but with the post function creates the loop
[08:02:36] <heythere> so guys i have this http://jsfiddle.net/EfqAL/ but when i request something it does 2 requests... the 2ond request brings back the data but they are not stored in the csv any ideas?
[08:11:17] <heythere> noone ?:D
[08:15:32] <farn5w0rth> how do i check if a paragraph/div is greater than say 150 characters or 3 lines?
[08:29:37] <Becognize> hello there
[08:32:15] <Becognize> i need a little help solving a scope issue: at the start of my plugin (so it's in a function) i declare a var source=this to save the element calling the plugin. later in a sub function i call the 'source' variable. however it is now not referring to the initial object but the "this" equivalent in that function ! how come ?
[08:33:03] <decx> show code
[08:39:04] <Becognize> here is a sample (removed code to expose just the strange part): http://pastebin.com/jS7MCjwu
[08:40:53] <Becognize> when calling filterInit() , filterSource is not the initial element
[08:44:24] <uskerine> if I use a class selector $('.myClass'), and I generate later via other events a new HTML element of that class, would it react to $('.myClass') or it won't because event was defined before element?
[08:44:39] <uskerine> I am generating a new html element which is not reacting to that selector
[08:45:21] <BillCriswell> uskerine: $('.myClass') would only select elements that exist at the moment it runs and it would not dynamically add new elements as they're created.
[08:46:39] <uskerine> Thanks, that's what I was suspecting... I am dynamically generating rows in a datatablewith a "delete this row" <button> or <a>
[08:46:43] <uskerine> how would you implement that?
[08:47:22] <uskerine> btw, your CSS trick to edit the cells was fantastic
[08:48:16] <hip_> i have multiple buttons. at the moment a simple onClick is on them. i want to apply jquery,however i want to block the click on all my items,until the function for the click is finished,and then enable again. is there any easy way to do this?
[08:48:53] <aboudreault> emm, getting strange behavior with firefox ans ajax.
[08:50:11] <uskerine> parent elemnts
[09:08:05] <decx> hip_ have a block var that you test against when you fire a click
[09:09:05] <uskerine> inside this... $('#newInvoiceTable').on('click', 'a.deleteRow', function() {
[09:09:27] <uskerine> how would you detect the row number in which the clicked item is located? (it is a datatable)
[09:09:47] <BillCriswell> uskerine: The .closest() tr's .index()
[09:09:48] <uskerine> I am trying this without success var row = $('#newInvoiceTable').fnGetData( this );
[09:09:56] <uskerine> ok
[09:10:15] <BillCriswell> uskerine: Why do you want the row number though?
[09:10:38] <uskerine> I want to delete that row
[09:10:47] <BillCriswell> Oh ok.
[09:11:02] <decx> but the call is coming from inside the row
[09:11:06] <uskerine> if there is any other way of doing it, I am listening
[09:11:29] <BillCriswell> .closest('tr').remove()
[09:11:38] <BillCriswell> Not sure why you'd need the index?
[09:11:51] <BillCriswell> Might have jumped in late.
[09:12:49] <uskerine> that works
[09:12:56] <uskerine> but
[09:13:00] <uskerine> the datatables is not updated
[09:13:09] <uskerine> you are deleting the HTML
[09:13:20] <BillCriswell> Oh.
[09:13:32] <BillCriswell> DataTable seems very popular, but never used it.
[09:13:33] <uskerine> so for example "showing n registers", keep that register
[09:13:49] <uskerine> datatables is really great
[09:13:49] <duch_kazatel> http://datatables.net/examples/api/select_single_row.html - "table.row('.selected').remove().draw( false );"
[09:14:14] <uskerine> how can i make to replace that table.row('.selected') by
[09:14:21] <uskerine> table.row(the row of the item i just clicked )
[09:14:22] <uskerine> :)
[09:14:36] <uskerine> i already saw that example for selection
[09:15:32] <duch_kazatel> if the selected class is added to the tr, just run .parents('tr') on $(this)
[09:16:06] <uskerine> i will try that
[09:19:03] <uskerine> tried this, without success:
[09:19:07] <uskerine> $('#newInvoiceTable').on('click', 'a.deleteRow', function() {
[09:19:07] <uskerine>             $(this).parents('tr').addClass('selected');
[09:19:07] <uskerine>             $('#newInvoiceTable').row('.selected').remove().draw( false ); });
[09:19:23] <BillCriswell> uskerine: Do you have a demo up somewhere?
[09:19:32] <BillCriswell> You should really try to create a demo.
[09:19:37] <uskerine> yeah i think so :(
[09:20:05] <duch_kazatel> i love newrelic so much lately.
[09:20:55] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: The tutorial site?
[09:21:09] <BillCriswell> Wait, thinking the wrong thing.
[09:21:10] <BillCriswell> Nevermind.

[09:21:39] <BillCriswell> Sweet.
[09:21:42] <BillCriswell> Charts are always fun.
[09:21:46] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[09:22:27] <BillCriswell> Their site is nice.
[09:22:30] <BillCriswell> Has some personality to it.
[09:24:33] <decx> it's everywhere
[09:24:49] <decx> you only notice this stuff when you have to whitelist domains for js
[09:28:44] <BillCriswell> decx: That's a definite benefit to that.
[09:28:59] <BillCriswell> I am still too lazy for all that right clicking... plus I'm a Mac guy so you know how that goes.
[09:30:41] <decx> hehe
[09:31:36] <decx> there's a gambling aspect to it too though when you visit a new site: which one of these 50 domains do i have to whitelist to get full functionality
[09:32:05] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, that does not sound appealing to me.
[09:32:43] <duch_kazatel> my company is trying to get better about that.

[09:35:19] <BillCriswell> I should take up freelancing or some shit.
[09:35:21] <Crucials> thanks decx
[09:35:22] <duch_kazatel> Crucials $(window).height() should only get the viewport.  is your document valid?
[09:35:33] <BillCriswell> or maybe a part time job doing development.
[09:35:37] <Crucials> duch_kazatel: I'm not sure? How do I know? :(
[09:35:42] <duch_kazatel> do you havea doctype?
[09:35:45] <Crucials> yes
[09:36:25] <duch_kazatel> maybe validate it with the W3?  or use decx's solution.

[09:56:07] <Vivekananda> I am trying to unravel the mysteries of creating and using a dashboard by using already coded example. I am still unclear about certain parts and hope someone here can shed some light. It is a novice/naive question and hope you guys dont mind.   this is the page --- https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/smartadmin-responsive-webapp-WB0573SK0      with the live preview  here ---        http://wrapbootstrap.com/preview/WB0573SK0     . I wanted to know what
[09:56:08] <Vivekananda>  the sections under  'graphs'    , 'tables'   etc on the left side navigation bar are there for.   ie what will that section's use be in the dashboard
[09:56:34] <decx> well something's fucky, 6 slides á 300px and the viewport is calculated at 5040px, doesnt make sense fasdfasdf
[09:57:32] <fasdfasdf> decx: I know something`s fucky :) but what do u suggest to do :\
[09:58:01] <decx> i cant suggest anything, automated website builders literally derk er jerbs
[09:58:14] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda not sure waht you mean.
[09:58:31] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha.
[09:58:31] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda you mean what somebody would use those controls for?
[09:58:35] <duch_kazatel> decx++
[09:59:04] <BillCriswell> I don't feel threatened by WYSIWYG websites at all... yet.
[09:59:29] <BillCriswell> As soon as you need to do something a little out of the ordinary they fall on their faces typically.
[09:59:45] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't worry about them yet - they have a bit of starbucks effect to them imo.
[10:00:04] <decx> that's what the cashiers, the productionline workers, the hole diggers and the dishwashers thought
[10:00:25] <decx> soon the truck drivers
[10:00:32] <decx> then the high level devs
[10:00:33] <fasdfasdf> decx: :S
[10:00:41] <duch_kazatel> and we still have cashiers, production workers, and hole diggers :)
[10:00:43] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: yep kind of.  What I mean is that on the left nav  these sections are present ie 'graphs'  or 'tables'  but I dont understand why.  IF they are part of the documentation of how the dashboard was constructed then they should part of the readme  isnt it ?   I am guessing they are not just  'HELP'  or 'readme' but if I buy this dashboard then those sections can be  SOMEhow used by me.  So I am trying to understand what is their use
[10:00:46] <fasdfasdf> decx: maybe some trick with JS ans CSS?
[10:01:00] <decx> what width did you set per slide
[10:01:03] <decx> in your backend
[10:01:11] <antlong> is there anything built in to the jquery ui dialog function that would allow auto scrolling after x lines?
[10:01:57] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda graphs are greate for visualising data.  that's the entire point.  rolling numbers of things.
[10:02:21] <duch_kazatel> think Day over Day revenue or javascript error reporting or anything else.
[10:02:31] <duch_kazatel> tables are great for granular data breakdown.
[10:03:52] <fasdfasdf> decx: nothing, it made automaticlly
[10:04:06] <antlong> im looking to emulate screen in a dialogue that gets feed text from a function
[10:05:45] <duch_kazatel> antlong you want there to be a vertical scrollbar in a dialogue?
[10:05:58] <antlong> duch_kazatel yes, that has a limit of say 5 lines
[10:06:06] <antlong> duch_kazatel kind of like `screen` does
[10:06:24] <antlong> so no visible scrollbar, just the functionality of hiding previous lines i guess?
[10:06:54] <duch_kazatel> hard set a height or max-height and set text-overflow: hidden;
[10:07:39] <antlong> duch_kazatel oh good idea, thank you
[10:10:07] <antlong> duch_kazatel hmn, since the text is appended to the bottom, how would i make the newest lines visible and the oldest hidden?
[10:10:26] <duch_kazatel> antlong why do you need to retain the "oldest"?
[10:10:44] <antlong> duch_kazatel i new to retain the newest, but they're hidden since they're at the bottom
[10:11:02] <duch_kazatel> the replace the text in the container.
[10:11:08] <duch_kazatel> instead of appending it.
[10:11:48] <decx> what like a chat?
[10:12:10] <fasdfasdf> decx: here is the init: http://soomlamain.wpengine.com/wp-content/plugins/js_composer/assets/js/js_composer_front.js?ver=4.1.3
[10:12:36] <duch_kazatel> D:
[10:12:56] <decx> yeah i'll go ahead and stab a fork in my knees while i'm debugging site-composer generated js :>
[10:14:41] <decx> i'd say write a message to the good people at visual composer that their fork of bootstraps carousel is shite
[10:15:10] <antlong> duch_kazatel prepend seems to work
[10:17:18] <duch_kazatel> antlong right but why do you need to keep the other text?
[10:17:24] <duch_kazatel> instead of prepending or appending?
[10:21:49] <antlong> duch_kazatel i don't think i do. this is for scrolling combat text
[10:22:05] <duch_kazatel> antlong then just use .text()
[10:22:33] <duch_kazatel> unless you really need to keep a log of sorts, then use .append() and scroll the contents appropriately.
[10:22:52] <duch_kazatel> but if you're not going to include a scrollbar, there's not much of a point.
[10:23:43] <decx> position an element absolutely to the bottom of a parent element with overflow: hidden, now you can append and the latest line will always be at the same point on the bottom
[10:32:04] <antlong> duch_kazatel its mostly for cosmetics
[10:34:45] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[11:03:21] <tpyo> can someone fix my idiocy?
[11:03:21] <tpyo> http://jsfiddle.net/eLhB6/1/
[11:03:36] <tpyo> I seemingly don't understand how to .bind()
[11:06:32] <decx> i don't even get what you're doing
[11:07:07] <duch_kazatel> with saner formatting: http://jsfiddle.net/eLhB6/4/
[11:07:52] <decx> what does bind on a function do?
[11:08:32] <decx> oh there's native bind i forgot
[11:27:16] <BillCriswell> Slowest. Day. Ever.
[11:27:26] <duch_kazatel> word
[11:29:16] <BillCriswell> Standing desk without no AC is pretty terrible haha.
[11:29:19] <BillCriswell> Might be thin soon.
[11:29:38] <BillCriswell> Can't wait till this gets fixed. Dudes have been working on it all day.
[11:29:54] <duch_kazatel> the AC sitch?
[11:30:03] <BillCriswell> YEs.
[11:30:09] <duch_kazatel> D: the worst.
[11:30:14] <BillCriswell> Thinking about switching back to sitting as well.
[11:30:30] <duch_kazatel> just get a tall chair so you can switch back and forth
[11:30:46] <decx> we have just about the perfect weather, 19°c/66°f with a slight wind and no clouds
[11:31:02] <BillCriswell> Yeah, wonder if I could talk management into that.
[11:31:10] <decx> warm enough to be nice, and cold enough to still sit inside on a computer ^^
[11:31:11] <BillCriswell> I never asked for anything before, wonder what it's like.
[11:31:25] <BillCriswell> 66 is pretty ideal
[11:31:52] <BillCriswell> It's 87 here right now.
[11:31:52] <duch_kazatel> word mid to high 60's is awesome.
[11:32:13] <duch_kazatel> 73 here, we'll cap out at the low to mid 90's
[11:32:47] <BillCriswell> I need 75 or lower to function right.
[11:33:47] <BillCriswell> BBQ on Saturday, 81°. I hope it's not humid.
[11:59:42] <Rob______> Hi, all! I was wondering is someone could clear me up a bit about the jquery Draggable, and Sortable plugin. I am trying to build a jquery based TemplateBuilder (For my CMS system) but the snapping for the connectWith and connectToSortable are sometimes giving a bit of trouble. Any tips on how to tweak it? Maybe take caution on Paddings / Margins of Elements?
[12:00:47] <Rob______> i have also noticed, that once it has snapped once, it re-snaps easier than the previous times.
[12:00:54] <Rob______> In most cases. That is.
[12:09:43] <Rob______> Anyone^^?
[12:23:54] <dmsuperman> How can I specify a submit event for a form which contains a specific element at the document level? So something like this:  $(document).on('change', 'form :input[role="global-search"]', this, function(e) { });
[12:23:54] <Rob______> Hi, all! I was wondering is someone could clear me up a bit about the jquery Draggable, and Sortable plugin.

[12:24:43] <dmsuperman> s/change/submit/  Is there any way to do what I want inline or will I have to do $(document).on('submit') and then just check for the existence of the element in the event handler?
[12:26:14] <duch_kazatel> dmsuperman not following - could you clarify.
[12:27:07] <dmsuperman> duch_kazatel: I want to set an onsubmit event for a form which contains :input[role="global-search"], in a global way such that if the form is injected after page load the event handler still works
[12:27:33] <Rob______> use delegate, instead of on
[12:27:38] <duch_kazatel> use .on()
[12:27:41] <duch_kazatel> that's the right thing.
[12:27:43] <dmsuperman> so I want $(document).on('submit', 'form', function(){ if $(this).find(':input[role="global-search"]') alert('this'); });
[12:27:45] <Rob______> he is using on.
[12:27:47] <duch_kazatel> then  $(document).on('change', 'form :input[role="global-search"]', function(e) { }); should work.
[12:27:54] <duch_kazatel> right - .on() supports delegation in that syntax.
[12:28:02] <dmsuperman> Sorry I'm trying to bind to the form's submit handler here
[12:28:09] <dmsuperman> I made a typo in my first line, not change
[12:28:12] <duch_kazatel> Rob______ http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[12:28:14] * syntax .on()
[12:28:21] <duch_kazatel> "As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method."
[12:28:23] <Rob______> duch_kazatel; i know.
[12:28:49] <Rob______> but on event is only activated once, delegate is the replacement for live
[12:29:00] <duch_kazatel> dmsuperman then change the event name.  $(document).on('submit', 'form :input[role="global-search"]', function(e) { });
[12:29:16] <duch_kazatel> Rob______ the version of on he is using supports delegation.
[12:29:20] <dmsuperman> duch_kazatel: but that binds to the submit event of an input, not the form, which doesn't happen does it?
[12:29:21] <Rob______> ic.
[12:29:25] <duch_kazatel> he doesn't need to re-run the binding in that case.
[12:29:32] <Rob______> Alright,
[12:29:32] <decx> on != one
[12:29:34] <duch_kazatel> live() and delegate() are both superceded by on.
[12:29:48] <duch_kazatel> dmsuperman aaaah that's what you're saying.
[12:30:03] <dmsuperman> so maybe something like form:contains(:input[role="global-search"])
[12:30:06] <dmsuperman> is there such a selector?
[12:30:17] <Rob______> which version does "On" support delegation? I am using 1.10.2 from google api's and the on event that i bound to a selector did not precede upon appendation.
[12:30:19] <duch_kazatel> yep.  http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[12:30:28] <dmsuperman> hah perfect, nice. cheers
[12:30:30] <duch_kazatel> Rob______ you have to pass a second arg to the handler.
[12:30:36] <Rob______> that explains it^^
[12:30:40] <duch_kazatel> Rob______ .on() has been preferred for a loooong time.
[12:30:56] <duch_kazatel> $(parent).on('event', 'child', function(){});
[12:30:58] <dmsuperman> Oh wait, no this :contains seems to search for text. I want a selector which allows for a subquery
[12:31:01] <Rob______> ; that i know. Just didn't know how to activate delegation on On
[12:31:11] <BillCriswell> dmsuperman: .has() could work.
[12:31:17] <BillCriswell> Might be a :has as well, not positive.
[12:31:28] <duch_kazatel> or http://api.jquery.com/has-selector/
[12:31:32] <dmsuperman> aha! BillCriswell yep
[12:31:33] <duch_kazatel> yep - :heas()
[12:31:36] <dmsuperman> perfect :D
[12:31:36] <duch_kazatel> err, :heas()
[12:31:40] <duch_kazatel> wtf i cannot type today
[12:31:41] <dmsuperman> haha duch_kazatel
[12:31:49] <Rob______> Anyway! Im having a problem too; with sortable and draggable; connectWith and connectToSortable;
[12:31:56] <BillCriswell> There's a :has?
[12:32:07] <dmsuperman> indeed so
[12:32:09] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[12:32:12] <Rob______> Snapping doesn't really work well, Any idea why ? :/ Im trying to make a sitebuilder.
[12:32:21] <duch_kazatel> Rob______ can you show us what you have?
[12:32:31] <Rob______> hmm, is not gonna be easy. Let me think
[12:32:35] <BillCriswell> DuckDuckGo is great but searching for :has didn't go too well.
[12:32:45] <Rob______> i can show you the instantiation of all sortable / draggables.
[12:32:55] <Rob______> but its multiple files, so its hard to make a whole combipack
[12:32:57] <duch_kazatel> Rob______ that's not going to show us much =/
[12:33:08] <Rob______> i guess. What do you need?
[12:33:19] <duch_kazatel> a simple, function jsfiddle is generally preferred.
[12:33:25] <Rob______> ouch ^^ ehm
[12:33:29] <decx> should've use www.symbolhound.com BillCriswell
[12:34:10] <duch_kazatel> if that's not feasible (it generally should be), then maybe your problem's scope is too large?
[12:34:26] <BillCriswell> decx: Interesting.
[12:34:34] <BillCriswell> decx: Google was always ok with :has vs .has
[12:34:46] <Rob______> Noo, there are just too many elements needed for it to work on the same scope as i am currently developing on
[12:34:57] <Rob______> css / html / jquery
[12:35:03] <decx> it's only stack iirc but that's the first thing i click on anyway BillCriswell ;)
[12:35:03] <Rob______> oh
[12:35:05] <Rob______> and tinymce also
[12:35:14] <dmsuperman> google seems to do a much poorer job when searching for code stuff these days
[12:35:18] <dmsuperman> also no more +term
[12:35:31] <dmsuperman> "term" sometimes works but not always
[12:35:36] <Rob______> Would it be okay, for me to show you a live version, duch ?
[12:35:45] <BillCriswell> decx: SHould probably use devdocs.io more
[12:35:50] <Rob______> sec, ill try
[12:36:01] <BillCriswell> I wish chrome would open up my homepage for "New Tabs"
[12:36:18] <decx> i forgot about that
[12:36:51] <BillCriswell> decx: It's still awesome. I just too instinctively go to my search bar.
[12:37:31] <decx> i
[12:37:32] <Rob______> duch_kazatel, ill finish up one, gimme a sec.
[12:37:41] <decx> i'm trying to add it to my quicksearch
[12:37:51] <decx> but the search page isnt really exposed
[12:38:38] <decx> like: dev wrap in my adressbar brings me directly to the result
[12:38:43] <BillCriswell> decx: devdocs.io/#q=keyword
[12:38:54] <decx> ye just saw it
[12:39:33] <BillCriswell> I wish it would default to that if I typed like a ` first or something in my search bar in Chrome.
[12:39:53] <BillCriswell> but having it global for all my searches isn't practical.
[12:39:57] <antlong> Can anyone help me figure out a good way to implement health bars?
[12:40:37] <BillCriswell> antlong: A div with 100% width, as you get hit it goes down.
[12:40:56] <guzzlefry> I'd opt for a div within a div.
[12:41:00] <antlong> BillCriswell that's a very interesting solution, thanks
[12:41:01] <dmsuperman> divception
[12:41:05] <decx> i cant type ` without breaking my hand
[12:41:10] <BillCriswell> guzzlefry: Definitely.
[12:41:12] <decx> there we go, it's broken
[12:41:16] <antlong>  <div class="playerHealth" id="playerHP" width="100%"> ?
[12:41:23] <antlong> how would i do the coloring?
[12:41:26] <duch_kazatel> css
[12:41:27] <guzzlefry> <div id="health_bar"><div id="remaining_health></div></div>
[12:41:30] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha, well, something to signify I don't want touse google.
[12:41:43] <BillCriswell> or the default search engine.
[12:41:50] <decx> doesnt chrome have keyword search as well?
[12:41:56] <guzzlefry> antlong: set a background color for #remaining_health
[12:41:58] <decx> were you set a search page as a bookmark and set a key
[12:42:11] <decx> and then you can shortcut to that searchpage with teh key
[12:42:18] <guzzlefry> one second, to the fiddle!
[12:42:19] <dmsuperman> <div style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: grey;"><div id="health" style="background-color: red; width: 100%;"></div></div>
[12:42:21] <BillCriswell> decx: Hmmm...
[12:42:35] <decx> i have imdb blah, youtube blah, stack blah, reddit blah and more
[12:42:38] <dmsuperman> decx: It used to but now it just learns them automatically
[12:43:02] <dmsuperman> so if you type imd and the first completion is imdb.com and you hit tab it will show a little "imdb" icon at the left side and now you're searching imdb
[12:43:04] <decx> because they lost the traffic from the 0.0001% that used the feature
[12:43:08] <dmsuperman> assuming you've used the search form on imdb before
[12:43:09] <decx> searchtraffic
[12:43:10] <decx> ^^
[12:43:29] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha truth.
[12:43:55] <dmsuperman> for instance if I type "ama<tab>" it shows "Searching Amazon.com:"
[12:44:16] <decx> ah right
[12:44:21] <dmsuperman> just tested, works with devdocs :)
[12:44:33] <decx> yeah i prefer the manual control with bookmark keys
[12:44:35] <BillCriswell> There's an html5 <meter> element... never touched that though.
[12:44:39] <antlong> dmsuperman thanks a lot.
[12:44:46] <guzzlefry> antlong: http://jsfiddle.net/ Make sense?
[12:44:51] <antlong> BillCriswell yeah looks useful, i'm going to try that later.
[12:44:54] <dmsuperman> I think you can still do that but it requires the tab decx
[12:45:04] <guzzlefry> oh wait, I did something wrong :P
[12:45:05] <BillCriswell> guzzlefry: That didn't link to anything. =)
[12:45:10] <BillCriswell> Haha
[12:45:17] <Rob______> Man, i don't know how to work with this fiddler,. it can't find the tinymce cdn
[12:45:35] <duch_kazatel> Rob______ uuuuhhhh... that's a little too big of a scope...
[12:45:37] <guzzlefry> ...sigh
[12:45:38] <decx> ironically tinymce is all but tiny
[12:45:48] <guzzlefry> antlong: http://jsfiddle.net/LHFgM/
[12:45:50] <Rob______> duch_ told you
[12:46:14] <duch_kazatel> if you need tinymce to demonstrate your problem, something tells me you need to pair stuff down.
[12:47:00] <Rob______> well, not directly i guess. But i don't know, Tinymce could  impair some things. So it needs to be included.
[12:47:10] <duch_kazatel> wat
[12:47:11] <Rob______> Sec
[12:47:12] <duch_kazatel> it shouldn't.
[12:47:20] <Rob______> no, i know it shouldn't
[12:48:41] <antlong> guzzlefry so the idea is to adjust the width as the health goes down?
[12:49:02] <guzzlefry> yep
[12:49:09] <dmsuperman> antlong: yep, innerElement.css('width', healthPercentage + '%')
[12:49:14] <antlong> guzzlefry the div contents are empty?
[12:49:20] <guzzlefry> yes
[12:49:29] <antlong> nice thank you
[12:49:32] <antlong> halfway there then
[12:49:34] <guzzlefry> but I've set height/width so it shows up
[12:50:08] <antlong> do i set class on both divs?
[12:50:33] <antlong> height i mean\
[12:50:45] <dmsuperman> height on the inner should suffice
[12:51:08] <dmsuperman> or as the fiddle shows, height: 100% on the inner and a specific height on the container
[12:51:41] <BillCriswell> You could just set a height on the child and the parent will grow... which feels weird to say.
[12:51:45] <Rob______> duch_kazatel; can't get it to work on jsfiddle. Too much js
[12:52:07] <guzzlefry> My concern is that once the child's width is 0, won't it collapse?
[12:52:11] <guzzlefry> guess I can test :P
[12:52:21] <duch_kazatel> Rob______ hrm.  not sure how anybody can be of much help then.  maybe somebody else will have some ideas.
[12:52:36] <Rob______> ohhh right
[12:52:45] <Rob______> I had the initialization on tinymce ready xD
[12:53:05] <dmsuperman> seems to work fine guzzlefry
[12:53:09] <BillCriswell> guzzlefry: It would collapse if it was floating.
[12:53:30] <guzzlefry> ah
[12:54:06] <BillCriswell> Collapsing always annoys me.
[12:54:07] <Rob______> almost have it. The element unit is somehow stuck in the left side of the page...
[12:54:13] <BillCriswell> Fucking margin collapsing.
[12:54:39] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I wanted the margin on an element inside this element to be outside of it.
[12:55:04] <BillCriswell> Sure there's a good reason for it, but it still feels dumb.
[12:56:14] <Rob______> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/eW5cL/5/ got it to work, im not familliar with jsfiddle, first time i used it. The example shows very well, how a new "Grid" is hard to snap on the top.
[13:02:39] <duch_kazatel> ah i see what you're saying.

[13:06:41] <Rob______> duch_kazatel: A new Block is snapping easier on the Fiddle; the first snap is hard on the live example
[13:06:50] <antlong> BillCriswell ooo thanks BillCriswell
[13:07:56] <BillCriswell> antlong: SHould clear that interval at below 0.
[13:09:01] <decx> what a healthbar on an interval?
[13:09:18] <BillCriswell> I should have named it "time"
[13:09:21] <decx> no matter how bad you play, damage is done random in a certain interval
[13:09:23] <decx> :>
[13:09:44] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha, that would be time I am sure.
[13:09:54] <decx> buy the bonus pack now to only get hit every 2nd interval !
[13:10:05] <decx> send cv to ea mobile now
[13:10:10] <BillCriswell> On it.

[13:18:00] <Rob______> duch_kazatel; Any success?
[13:18:09] <duch_kazatel> Rob______ sorry got pulled away.
[13:18:15] <Rob______> I see; its ok=p
[13:18:50] <BillCriswell> antlong: Looks about the gist of it.
[13:19:41] <PerlWebDev> small issue that I'm having that is hard to track down. Attaching a datepicker to two text fields. Occasionally the IDs that it chooses to use for the fields ends up the same causing data entry to always go to the first field. Refreshing the page generally seems to fix the issue, but not sure why it is happening in the first place.
[13:20:09] <__joshua___> the jquery ui datepicker?
[13:20:20] <PerlWebDev> yup
[13:20:32] <PerlWebDev> 1.10.4 for jquery-ui
[13:20:37] <PerlWebDev> 1.9.1 for jquery
[13:20:45] <__joshua___> lemme have a look.  should definately not happen
[13:20:57] <duch_kazatel> Rob______ something tells me it's because you don't have a droppable area above that first grid.
[13:21:15] <Rob______> Droppable area above the first grid?
[13:21:38] <__joshua___> perlWebDev:  what element is the colliding id on?
[13:21:42] <Rob______> which "First? (The one that is already there once you refresh the page? )"
[13:21:46] <duch_kazatel> yes
[13:21:52] <Rob______> yes, there should be
[13:21:53] <duch_kazatel> Rob______ there's no spacing between the first "grid" and the padding on the container.
[13:22:04] <Rob______> I tried giving it 300px padding top
[13:22:06] <Rob______> didn't help
[13:22:10] <Rob______> Also tried it with margin
[13:22:21] <duch_kazatel> right - the padding and margin will only exacerbate the problem.
[13:22:25] <duch_kazatel> because you can't drop onto padded areas.
[13:22:30] <PerlWebDev> <input type="text" name="o.xxx_xxx_w1"> and <input type="text" name="o.xxx_xxx_w2">
[13:22:56] <Rob______> Okay, so.. How can i space it without paddings or margins?
[13:23:08] <PerlWebDev> each ends up with an id="sel_xxxxxxx" value. most times that is unique for each field, but sometimes it isn't
[13:23:49] <__joshua___> have you tried giving them explicit ids before hand?
[13:24:23] <PerlWebDev> no, because these pages are generated by other code. So any number of date/text fields might be outputted
[13:24:26] <duch_kazatel> probably a combo of using top and bottom css properties, and I'd consider creating a "droppable" area with a height/width above the topmost grid.
[13:24:47] <Rob______> yeah but that wouldn't solve the tree problem.
[13:24:52] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:25:00] <PerlWebDev> and this wasn't an issue until updating our site to use 1.10.4
[13:25:06] <__joshua___> PerlWebDev:  I think an id isn't applied by jquery ui if one exists.  so you could loop through and give each one an id based on a counter
[13:25:22] <Rob______> It allows nested drops; And for example; if i have 2 rows in 1 column, it would also be hard to drop in above the first row inside of a column
[13:25:40] <kev999> do any of you guys have experience of using blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload - I'm wanting to tag uploaded files with extra title information
[13:25:43] <Rob______> So i can fix the part that its easier to drop above the first grid, but then id still have the problem, inside the grid with other nested grids.
[13:25:52] <PerlWebDev> __joshua___: that is my understanding. I just didn't want to have to change our entire site for what seems like a bug in jquery/jquery-ui since it was working fine before.
[13:25:59] <Krisg> hi how can i display an image using jsp.. like if <bean:write name="test" property="isOK"/> displays an img that's Green.jpg if its true else the Red.jpg ?
[13:26:10] <duch_kazatel> Krisg wrong room.
[13:26:36] <duch_kazatel> Rob______ i don't see the problem of nested stuff, but that's going to be your problem - you need to have a "spot" available for you to drop things onto.
[13:26:43] <duch_kazatel> right now you don't have that.
[13:26:48] <__joshua___> PerlWebDev:  fair enough, but because you are doing $(selector).datepicker();  you can probably add the line $(selector).forEach(function(el){ $(el).attr(id, 'xxxxx'+counter++);});
[13:27:13] <Rob______> atleast i know the problem now :) thank you, Duch ill think of something, what are developers for right =) ?
[13:27:30] <duch_kazatel> Rob______ huh?  are you not the developer on this project?
[13:27:42] <Rob______> ofcourse i am ! haha, i wrote everything except the libraries myself
[13:27:57] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[13:28:08] <Rob______> im on my own on this one. Don't worry =p i didn't use copyrighted material; all mine
[13:28:17] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:28:24] <PerlWebDev> __joshua___: I'll look into updating the site. just thought I'd bring it up in case it is a minor bug hiding in jquery-ui somewhere
[13:28:26] <duch_kazatel> i'd make sure to read (and re-read) all the documentation on droppable areas.
[13:28:41] <Rob______> Alright :)
[13:28:52] <PerlWebDev> we were using 1.10.1 before and not experiencing this
[13:28:56] <__joshua___> PerlWebDev:  how easy is it to reproduce?
[13:29:03] <PerlWebDev> hard
[13:29:48] <PerlWebDev> which is why it has been a pain for me. I can see when it is happening, but since the id="" is added by jquery, it is something in code that I'm not familiar with.
[13:30:00] <__joshua___> will give it a brief try.  to give me an idea,  how many date elements vs how often?
[13:30:26] <PerlWebDev> less than 1% of the time for some users, but that includes the CEO, heheh. Normally only 2 date elements are on the page.
[13:30:53] <PerlWebDev> the rest of the text fields are for other types of data, so don't get the datepicker class
[13:30:57] <__joshua___> ok, so if I do 10,000 the odds will go up substantially
[13:31:15] <PerlWebDev> yup.
[13:31:25] <__joshua___> any reason you used 1.10.4 and not 1.11?
[13:31:55] <PerlWebDev> 1.10.4 was out at the time I was doing an update and this issue didn't show up until after it got out into the larger use audience
[13:32:05] <__joshua___> makes sense
[13:32:23] <PerlWebDev> and to be clear, that is 1.10.4 for jquery-ui
[13:32:43] <__joshua___> right
[13:33:08] <__joshua___> and 1.9.1 jq
[13:33:11] <PerlWebDev> haven't brought jquery up to date for our site. Still on 1.9.1
[13:33:17] <PerlWebDev> yup
[13:33:40] <Rob______> duch_kazatel; thanks for the help, till anothertime!
[13:35:27] <__joshua___> heh, 10k datepickers crashes my browser
[13:35:38] <BillCriswell> Oh no who's using 10K datepickers?
[13:35:45] <duch_kazatel> EVERYBODY! YAAAAAAAAAAY
[13:35:46] <BillCriswell> How did I miss that.
[13:36:04] <PerlWebDev> here's the JS that sets up the datepicker
[13:36:04] <PerlWebDev> http://pastebin.com/uu7CuBTH
[13:36:19] <PerlWebDev> in case that matters, like a bad option being passed in, heheh
[13:41:05] <__joshua___> all ids are sequential in my tests
[13:41:37] <PerlWebDev> are you adding the IDs yourself?
[13:41:45] <PerlWebDev> cause the jquery ones are all random
[13:41:56] <__joshua___> wait, the time looks like epoch in ms
[13:41:59] <PerlWebDev> "sel_51fQM/rR0T6Ow"
[13:45:36] <__joshua___> im getting dpxxxxxxxxxx http://jsfiddle.net/bPSLU/7/
[13:46:48] <PerlWebDev> so, the issue is that the code is attaching too fast and accidentally generating the same ID for the two fields?
[13:47:26] <__joshua___> but yours is a random string, right?
[13:47:30] <PerlWebDev> yup
[13:47:46] <PerlWebDev> generated by jquery using whatever method datepicker has
[13:47:49] <PerlWebDev> builtin
[13:48:13] <PerlWebDev> since the fields don't have an ID until $(selector).datepicker() is run
[13:48:24] <__joshua___> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/dQP9xTd9
[13:48:55] <__joshua___> oh, thats master.  lemme try older version
[13:50:15] <__joshua___> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/1-10-stable/ui/jquery.ui.datepicker.js line 143, the id will be uniq
[13:51:21] <__joshua___> same is the case in 1.10.4
[13:51:35] <__joshua___> is that definately the version you are running?
[13:52:06] <PerlWebDev> jQuery UI - v1.10.4 - 2014-04-02
[13:52:31] <PerlWebDev> and jQuery v1.9.1 | (c) 2005, 2012 jQuery Foundation, Inc. | jquery.org/license
[13:52:46] <PerlWebDev> are what show up in Firebug
[13:53:13] <__joshua___> well ids should be prefixed with dp _ + this.uuid, which inits to current time, i believe.   Is some other code applying ids?
[13:53:55] <PerlWebDev> that's a good question since I get sel_xxxxxxx for ours
[13:56:58] <PerlWebDev> alright. Thanks __joshua___. This has been very informative :)
[13:57:27] <PerlWebDev> going to dig deeper into our codebase and see what might be hiding in the deep recesses of this stuff
[13:57:42] <__joshua___> Good luck
[13:57:52] <__joshua___> just greping for 'sel_' might help
[13:57:57] <PerlWebDev> thanks. I really appreciate the help.
[14:02:36] <jrockjiggz> Hi, i'm trying to drag and image from the browser into another program in Windows.  It doesn't work.  Instead, a text url gets placed into the program.  Would anyone know anything about dragging out of the browser?
[14:12:59] <duch_kazatel> jrockjiggz what's the other program?
[14:13:27] <jrockjiggz> duch_kazatel, it's Nuance eCopy
[14:14:16] <duch_kazatel> and you can drag the image to your desktop just fine?
[14:15:45] <duch_kazatel> because i don't think that's something you can fix with jquery/javascript.
[14:20:42] <jrockjiggz> duch_kazatel, yes I can drag to the desktop, i'm going to look into dragging from the Canvas element
[14:21:15] <duch_kazatel> jrockjiggz your problem is with eCopy.
[14:21:16] <Johnathan1707> How can I wait to do something until several ajax calls are made and some formatting made to them? I've had a look at $.when().then() but it's not returning anything in the then part
[14:21:46] <jrockjiggz> duch_kazatel, if I drag from desktop into eCopy it inserts as an image
[14:22:05] <jrockjiggz> copy/paste worked aswell
[14:22:31] <duch_kazatel> jrockjiggz right.  that means that eCopy does not recognize the drag from the browser.
[14:22:41] <duch_kazatel> i would guess at least
[14:23:16] <Johnathan1707> This is a stripped down version of the code, https://gist.github.com/Johnathan/8f74d816d496f6e7c9a5, those two functions are performing an ajax request (completing and I can log the sata from them), doing some formatting then returning it but console.log gives me undefined
[14:35:40] <nervousMoose> I have an array of checkboxes (all named ft[]) with unique values. .serializeArray() only picks up the first value (the rest are ignored, whether they are checked or not) in IE8. Any idea why?
[14:36:48] <duch_kazatel> have a fiddle?
[14:37:16] <nervousMoose> It's a huge file, so I don't, sorry :( I was just curious if there was a known issue with serializeArray and IE8
[14:38:38] <duch_kazatel> i was looking for more of a simplified example.  "an array of checkboxes" is confusing. - can you use this as a starting point? http://jsfiddle.net/2ju63/
[14:38:42] <uskerine> how would you move a row in datatables?
[14:39:03] <__joshua___> move?  like reorder?
[14:39:05] <uskerine> like row 3 is moved to 2nd position (so 3 becomes 2 and 2 becomes 3)
[14:39:15] <nervousMoose> duch: Oh, true, let me type something up and see if I get the same behavior in jsfiddle
[14:39:22] <uskerine> but manually
[14:39:31] <uskerine> i would like to have a button to allow user reordering
[14:41:28] <__joshua___> uskerine:  google offers a few drag n drop (jquery sortable) plugins
[14:41:46] <__joshua___> also, you can clear, get data, reorder (with array splice n such) and setData
[14:42:00] <__joshua___> .fnClearTable();  .fnAddData(data); .fnDraw();
[14:42:30] <uskerine> i wouldn't need so much functionality as drag n drop
[14:42:44] <uskerine> i have managed to add rows delete them and edit cells
[14:43:23] <uskerine> is there any solution more simple to allow users moving rows up and down with buttons on the same row (maybe arrows, for example)
[14:44:54] <__joshua___> click handler on arrow, splice row out and in to data array, draw
[14:45:33] <uskerine> what do you mean by splice row out and in to data array?
[14:49:11] <diverdude> can something like this be done in jquery without lagging like this example does? http://alloyui.com/examples/diagram-builder/real-world/    basically i am looking for a qay to build simple block diagrams with just blocks and arrows to connect blocks
[14:55:01] <antlong> how would i add autoscrolling to a chat window? right now its set to overflow:scroll
[15:00:18] <duch_kazatel> antlong if i remember correctly decs gave you a solution for that earlier.
[15:00:26] <duch_kazatel> *decx
[15:01:10] <antlong> duch_kazatel this is for a chat window, the newest text is on the bottom, so i want to automatically scroll to the newest as it comes in
[15:01:13] <antlong> different problem i think
[15:01:29] <duch_kazatel> you can use a similar solution for it, but ok ;)
[15:09:53] <decx> no the position bottom thing doesnt scroll
[15:12:12] <decx> basicly you want scrollTop and prop
[15:12:20] <decx> scrollHeight
[15:12:31] <decx> antlong http://jsfiddle.net/decx/44BVe/
[15:13:12] <antlong> decx yes thats it, tyvm
[15:15:02] <hackal> Hello, I have a small problem somehow event.target.id is not working. http://jsfiddle.net/9MhTV/2/ here you can see that on first 2 boxes it wont alert ID but on third it will. I think it targets <p> tag how could I avoid that?
[15:17:47] <__joshua___> http://jsfiddle.net/9MhTV/4/ ?
[15:17:59] <decx> well the target is the p, and you dont need it, because this relates to the .box you clicked so use this.id
[15:18:20] <decx> also use console
[15:18:25] <decx> instead of alert
[15:19:05] <decx> or event.currentTarget like __joshua___ wrote, if you want to write all that
[15:20:06] <hackal> thank you for help decx __joshua___

[15:24:17] <fronix> I have a div like this <div class="lots of different classes"></div> I'd like to remove the class "different" using jquery, how can i do that?
[15:24:51] <duch_kazatel> .removeClass('different')
[15:25:09] <fronix> What happens is, the whole div gets removed
[15:25:21] <duch_kazatel> when you use .removeClass()
[15:28:57] <fronix> duch_kazatel, ahh was doing it alittle wrong. I get it now, thnx
[15:29:37] <antlong> decx im not sure I have control over changing what i need for that to work
[15:29:48] <antlong> decx you can check it out in action, www.multiverseminer.com click chat
[15:34:38] <douglas> for the .ajax method in query, how can I set the url as the next page of my website? Like right now I have paginated: localhost:3000/?page=1, localhost:3000/?page=2 and so on. what would I put in the url for this?
[15:35:12] <duch_kazatel> douglas check the querystring for the current page and add 1.
[15:37:33] <douglas> duch_kazatel: once I got the query string and added 1 to the page #, would the url just be "/?page=i" or "localhost:3000:?page=i"
[15:37:50] <douglas> sorry that second : should be a / after 3000
[15:38:00] <duch_kazatel> douglas i'd be explicit with the url, but you can do relative paths just fine.
[15:41:14] <duch_kazatel> i think.  i could be wrong about thgat.
[15:44:15] <surf2b1> When I load jquery it stops adding a new line. I would expect the result to be foo<br>bar<br>baz. What am I doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/K7ces/
[15:45:03] <decx> text() just gets the plain text
[15:45:27] <decx> html() for everything in there
[15:45:35] <Zzaichik> var text = foo.html();
[15:46:01] <surf2b1> it works with just plain JavaScript. See here: http://jsfiddle.net/q5445/
[15:46:26] <surf2b1> or am I just a newb and that code shouldn't even work
[15:46:47] <surf2b1> My real question is... how do I keep the new lines?
[15:46:55] <decx> that doesnt work, that just doesnt do anything
[15:48:17] <duch_kazatel> surf2b1 that throws an error - it's not working.
[15:49:09] <surf2b1> duch_kazatel: My bad. Realized that right when I posted. Do you know how I can get the text but keep the line breaks?
[15:49:24] <duch_kazatel> .html()
[15:49:30] <duch_kazatel> like decx just said.
[15:52:10] <douglas> can you put in divs to the .ajax url parameter? like in .load ?
[15:52:49] <duch_kazatel> douglas nope.
[15:52:53] <duch_kazatel> you need to give it a URL.
[15:53:28] <douglas> so If I just used .load instead of .ajax  I could load only a certain div of the page?
[15:53:32] <surf2b1> Thanks guys.. I guess this won't work with what I'm attempting to do though
[15:53:33] <surf2b1> http://jsfiddle.net/Xbzea/
[15:53:37] <surf2b1> any pointers?
[15:53:44] <duch_kazatel> douglas what are you trying to do.
[15:54:32] <duch_kazatel> surf2b1 woah what.  what are you trying to accomplish here?
[15:54:58] <douglas> create an infinite scroll. so upon my event listener being called- when the scroll bar reaches the bottom, I want a call to the next page (/?page=2), and append page 2's div contents to the same div on page 1
[15:55:00] <surf2b1> trying to only show the first letter of each word
[15:55:14] <Rob_> Hey, duch_kazatel, i did what you told me what it still isn't working, the dropzone is as big as it seems. It still isn't snapping; The fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/eW5cL/10/
[15:55:22] <surf2b1> but my replace is changing <br> to <__>
[15:55:42] <surf2b1> guess I could do another replace afterwards
[15:56:25] <duch_kazatel> Rob_ dunno what to tell you.  sorry.
[15:56:56] <duch_kazatel> surf2b1 wait are you trying to find html using a regular expression?
[15:57:35] <duch_kazatel> douglas you should be hitting an API endpoint that serves up the specific content you need instead of a whole page.
[15:58:09] <Rob_> Would someone else seem to know why the draggable element with connectToSortable isn't snapping easily on the top of the container? A fiddle; http://jsfiddle.net/eW5cL/10/
[16:00:00] <uskerine> I have this: '<textarea name="description" rows="1">'+sData[2]+'</textarea>',   where sData[2] contains <br />'s. How should those <br /> converted into break lines so textarea is properly populated? thanks
[16:00:16] <douglas> well yes, I don't want the whole page. just the content in a specific div. What do you mean by an API endpoint?
[16:01:01] <antlong> I'm having trouble finding what a variable is bound to, is there an easy way to search through everything?
[16:01:25] <antlong> this.category in this; is true though
[16:01:29] <antlong> so i know its in this somewhere
[16:02:44] <duch_kazatel> douglas you should have a way to serve up the specific content you need, instead of the whole page.
[16:03:06] <surf2b1> duch_kazatel: was trying to get text people input and output only the first letter of each word. Got it working but might not be the best way. http://jsfiddle.net/5jMJh/
[16:04:28] <duch_kazatel> douglas but i believe .load() has a way to select a specific element to pop in from your sourc epage.
[16:04:29] <djzn> the following validates an input form /^[a-zA-Z\s]+$/ , but restricts Cedilla, Atilde, and such latin characters... how do I do to unrestrict for Cedilla, Atilde and Agrave (Á, Ç, Ã) ?
[16:05:26] <duch_kazatel> surf2b1 you should probably grab the .html() and then iterate through the individual textnodes in it to get what you want.
[16:05:48] <surf2b1> thanks for the help.
[16:09:55] <douglas> duch_kazatel: ok so right now I have views that act upon url requests like /?page=2 routes to my index view. This index view loads a different set of elements into the view based on the url query string number. Are you saying that I should change this so that I have two views? one for the home page and the first set of elements, then an additional view for every call to /?page=x which just has the html of the content I want to load?
[16:10:54] <duch_kazatel> douglas basically.
[16:11:44] <douglas> duch_kazatel: orrrr I could use .load and just pick that specifc div right? Would this be slower/less efficient?
[16:11:53] <duch_kazatel> correct
[16:12:14] <duch_kazatel> your server and browser will have to do a bunch of extra work to get you the content you need.
[16:13:20] <douglas> ok so if I picked the first option, then do you think my home page view should automatically include the first elements? Or should it itself just call that view which just returns the elements to be paginated? I guess this is getting away from query a bit
[16:14:05] <duch_kazatel> your page view should be separate from the homepage view.
[16:14:31] <duch_kazatel> imo you should have an API that you can hit externally for that content, and then have a way to cann that internally, as well.
[16:15:08] <douglas> duch_kazatel: why is that necessary/desirable?
[16:15:08] <duch_kazatel> *can include that internall
[16:15:13] <duch_kazatel> separations of concern
[16:15:40] <douglas> but if no ones hitting it externally, then that isn't a concern right?
[16:15:56] <duch_kazatel> one is your generic page "wrapper", the other is your page content.  that way, when you later want to be able to call in that content via javascript, you can easily set that up.
[16:16:51] <duch_kazatel> (ie where you are now)
[16:19:11] <NaN> hi there
[16:19:25] <NaN> can someone help me to addapt this 'lock' method for the bootstrap modal to v3? http://jsfiddle.net/Sz7ZS/
[16:20:39] <duch_kazatel> NaN seems to work fine from here.
[16:31:46] <uskerine> hi, how can I select an entire HTML <div> area -no formatting/processing, raw string-? -I want to send the whole HTML content via ajax to the web server-
[16:32:28] <NaN> duch_kazatel: with bootstrap v3? :S
[16:32:46] <duch_kazatel> NaN are you including it there?
[16:32:53] <duch_kazatel> show me the broken thing, not a working thing.
[16:39:19] <louism2wash> Hey guys, does anyone have any experience testing ajax callbacks using jasmine?
[16:40:12] <BillCriswell> uskerine: You can do like $('#foo')[0].outerHTML I Think.
[16:58:31] <BillCriswell> decx: Ever watch Easy Rider?
[17:03:30] <BillCriswell> __joshua___: I saw you in #documentcloud helping someone with backbone. Do you find yourself looking at any other JS frameworks or do you mostly stick to that?
[17:13:41] <lsv> hey guys
[17:13:42] <lsv> uhhh
[17:13:53] <lsv> anyone about to help me with something silly? at least, I suspect it's silly
[17:13:54] <lsv> >_<
[17:13:59] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ lsv
[17:13:59] <b-ot> lsv: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:14:09] <lsv> done! ty
[17:14:35] <lsv> my question is using jquery.instagram.js to create a photo stream, however, I would like to Insert the stream as <a... images>
[17:14:58] <lsv> return $('<li>')
[17:15:00] <lsv> .append($('<a>')
[17:15:02] <lsv> .append($('<img>')
[17:15:04] <lsv> .addClass('instagram-image')
[17:15:06] <lsv> .attr('src', image_url))
[17:15:08] <lsv> );
[17:15:10] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ lsv
[17:15:10] <b-ot> lsv: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:15:17] <lsv> well i'm silly
[17:15:19] <lsv> ty duch
[17:15:20] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[17:15:23] <lsv> :)
[17:15:34] <lsv> hehe that's true, if pasted in fiddle another could reply with the fix and excplanation :)
[17:16:02] <duch_kazatel> even better - we can actually see what you're working with.
[17:16:27] <jaspertheghost_> helloso i have this function jsfiddle.net/mBqbF/1/?id=123&test=1  it did work but all of a sudden its not  can someone take a look
[17:17:09] <lsv> haha yea
[17:17:11] <lsv> understood, tyvm
[17:17:35] <duch_kazatel> jaspertheghost_ because window.location.search isn't what you think it is in jsfiddle.
[17:17:50] <jaspertheghost_> its not working on my computer either
[17:18:03] <jaspertheghost_> in firefox
[17:18:03] <duch_kazatel> do a console.log() of window.location.search
[17:18:22] <duch_kazatel> are you just trying to get querystring params?
[17:18:30] <jaspertheghost_> yep
[17:18:45] <duch_kazatel> http://stevenbenner.com/2010/03/javascript-regex-trick-parse-a-query-string-into-an-object/
[17:18:48] <duch_kazatel> just use this.
[17:19:25] <lsv> Hey all, I'm trying to remove the <li> from line 53 of the javascript, but it seems to break my DOM element, any thoughts? - Here's the fiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/kbB79/2/ - Thanks in advanced!
[17:19:41] <jaspertheghost_> thanks
[17:19:58] <duch_kazatel> lsv don't modify the plugin >.>
[17:20:25] <duch_kazatel> lsv if you HAVE to do it that way, change it to an a
[17:21:42] <jaspertheghost_> ReferenceError: anchor is not defined
[17:22:00] <duch_kazatel> wat
[17:22:20] <__joshua___> BillCriswell:  backbone at work, angular at home, atm
[17:22:28] <duch_kazatel> did you even read the article, jaspertheghost_ ?
[17:22:49] <jaspertheghost_> yes
[17:23:01] <duch_kazatel> then why'd you use anchor?
[17:23:17] <BillCriswell> __joshua___: How are you liking angular? Keep trying to get into but I keep losing interest.
[17:23:25] <jaspertheghost_> ahh
[17:23:26] <duch_kazatel> jaspertheghost_ try this instead: http://jsfiddle.net/3Kzcx/
[17:24:03] <__joshua___> BillCriswell: too much magic involved to make me want to use it more, frankly.  Im mostly doing to it for the xp.
[17:24:53] <BillCriswell> __joshua___: HAha I hear you.
[17:24:59] <lsv> return $('<li>')
[17:25:01] <lsv> .addClass('instagram-placeholder')
[17:25:02] <lsv> whoops sry
[17:25:02] <BillCriswell> And backbone?
[17:25:03] <lsv> ack!
[17:25:04] <lsv> .attr('id', photo.id)
[17:25:11] <duch_kazatel> don't paste into the channel, lsv
[17:25:31] <jaspertheghost_> still doesnt work
[17:25:45] <lsv> sry about that
[17:25:53] <lsv> duch - thanks, unfortunately i have to edit the plugin as I need the feed out of a list:(
[17:26:01] <lsv> i'll go around and remove the li from the DOM instead :)
[17:26:11] <duch_kazatel> lsv not sure what you mean, but ok.
[17:26:22] <duch_kazatel> jaspertheghost_ could you update that fiddle with the URL of your page?
[17:27:28] <jaspertheghost_> not sure what u mean
[17:27:49] <duch_kazatel> take the URL of your page, paste it into the fiddle, update the fiddle, and shoot it my way.
[17:27:56] <duch_kazatel> so i can see the url you're dealing with.
[17:28:19] <jaspertheghost_> http://jsfiddle.net/3Kzcx/3/
[17:28:49] <duch_kazatel> jaspertheghost_ because in jsfiddle the URL in the url bar is not the same URL as where the javascript executes.
[17:29:23] <duch_kazatel> pass around a string instead: http://jsfiddle.net/3Kzcx/4/
[17:30:22] <jaspertheghost_> that kind of defeats the purpose though… i have a page that will have variables passed to it in the URL … ill need to have JS grab them
[17:31:33] <BillCriswell> Man, Jack Nicholson looks like he's about 20 in Easy Rider.
[17:31:51] <BillCriswell> jaspertheghost_: It's just for a demo.
[17:33:10] <BillCriswell> jaspertheghost_: When you're actually using you'd essentially do var theURl = location.href
[17:33:28] <BillCriswell> Er, window.location.href
[17:33:50] <BillCriswell> or even window.location.search
[17:35:03] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[17:35:09] <duch_kazatel> nah window.location.href
[17:35:15] <duch_kazatel> make it easy.
[17:35:21] <freebirD2> hi, I've this multiselect, I'm trying to be able to have more than on the same page, it works, but there's a white stripe under each select, what am I missing please ?? http://www.pizzariadomcattione.com.br/multiselect/
[17:36:52] <duch_kazatel> welp
[17:37:53] <BillCriswell> jaspertheghost_: http://fiddle.jshell.net/3Kzcx/9/show/?foo=iamfoo&baz=iambaz
[17:37:58] <BillCriswell> Look at the console.
[17:40:17] <jaspertheghost_> thank you that worked
[17:40:31] <jaspertheghost_> the first function i put up worked before i went to maverick
[17:40:33] <jaspertheghost_> weird ..
[17:40:50] <jaspertheghost_> maverick and new Firefox version
[17:41:31] <BillCriswell> No idea why something like that would cause issues.
[18:38:19] <sadtaco> Is there something like :contains but more exact?  Like <p>foo</p><p>foo bar</p> $('p:contains(foo)'); is going to select both when I just want the first that's matched exactly
[18:41:21] <BillCriswell> sadtaco: Would need to use .filter() probably.
[18:41:46] <sadtaco> yeah. DAmn.
[18:41:52] <BillCriswell> $('p').filter(function(){ return $.trim($(this).text()) === 'foo'; }).addClass('only-foo');
[18:45:10] <sadtaco> well... That made odd as fuck results.
[18:45:24] <sadtaco> I see why it should work, but it's not.
[18:45:28] <sadtaco> Oh I know why :|
[18:46:16] <BillCriswell> sadtaco: Sweeet.
[18:47:09] <sadtaco> Nope apparently I don't know why. I thought it was my lack of trim and having some white space, but it's not, and no I can't jsfiddle.
[18:47:47] <sadtaco> Oh yeah I know what the other problem is..
[18:48:11] <BillCriswell> sadtaco: lol ok
[18:50:07] <BillCriswell> sadtaco: Case sensitivity?
[18:50:27] <sadtaco> Na.  I was replacing the contains with a filter and no selector for my a elements to begin with :P
[18:50:37] <BillCriswell> Good times.
[18:50:42] <sadtaco> When I should have been following the .find('a:contains(...)') with the .filter().
[18:50:56] <sadtaco> Real dumb.
[18:51:42] <BillCriswell> Happens.
[19:25:56] <Fraz> hi
[19:27:50] <Fraz> i have to sort some elements in a ui/browser app type thing im making. I need to produce an order on a timeline. Im currently getting all the keyframe elements from the timeline, checking their left position and sorting according to that
[19:27:57] <Fraz> does this sound like bad practice?
[19:29:05] <Fraz> keyframes can be added, but then dragged around, before or after keyframes that were added before
[19:37:55] <Ansikt> Fraz, if I understand what you're saying it sounds like you're reading data from the DOM, which is generally bad practice.
[19:42:42] <__joshua___> Fraz: you should seperate your model (pure javascript) and the view, (the dom).  you can read events from the DOM to update your model.
[19:55:01] <il>  hi all
[20:11:34] <freebirD2> please, how do I add a multiselect input with jquery please, going nuts already, here's my approach: http://pizzariadomcattione.com.br/addbut/
[20:14:18] <antlong> my function: https://dpaste.de/Tb7N doesn't include multiples of items, so if there's 3 wood, it will only do 1. how do i fix that?
[20:16:21] <antlong> sorry this is the whole thing: https://dpaste.de/Qkdo  how do i make it include all amounts of the items in the object, instead of only 1?
[20:19:21] <freebirD2> anybody could give me a help creating a multiselect input on the fly, please ? http://pizzariadomcattione.com.br/addbut/
[22:05:42] <antlong> is $("some-modal").replace("text") valid for clearing out the modal contents before appending?
[22:07:11] <akim> antlong, i would just do $("id").val("")
[22:07:31] <antlong> akim is there an onClose type function i can use?
[22:07:46] <akim> or $("id").removeChildren()
[22:08:03] <akim> antlong, i would look into jQueryUI for that
[22:08:08] <antlong> ok thanks akim
[22:09:41] <antlong> akim maybe append is wrong?
[22:09:58] <akim> what do you mean append is wrong?
[22:10:09] <antlong> akim i tried: $("#scavmodal").val("").append("You decomposed: " + removed);
[22:10:13] <akim> oh
[22:10:15] <akim> no
[22:10:16] <antlong> it just appended the message to the previous though
[22:10:28] <akim> $("id").removeChildren().append("..")
[22:10:37] <akim> i thought you mean clearing out a textbox input
[22:10:47] <antlong> akim perfect, thanks
[22:11:16] <akim> antlong, you could also try $("id").empty().append("..")
[22:11:17] <antlong> ugh wtf, removeChildren is not a function
[22:11:29] <akim> try empty()
[22:11:33] <antlong> on it
[22:11:58] <antlong> perfect, thank you
[22:12:30] <akim> np
[22:51:51] <jop008> what is the proper way to build a searchable listview using jqm 142?
[22:52:35] <Technodrome> i got a block of html i need to run, how can i do that with jquery
[22:52:52] <Technodrome> its a form, i need to post it, but i dont want to build the form with ajax stuff in jquery, i just want to run the submit
[23:09:56] <jyg> Hello, I have some click events based upon class selectors, $('.some-ccs-class-name').click(function() { ... });  which only fire off when there's more than one element referenced by the selector
[23:10:13] <jyg> I cannot figure out why one or many should make a difference
[23:10:19] <jyg> http://pastebin.com/AynBVrFG
[23:10:28] <jyg> the javascript is towards the bottom
[23:10:55] <jyg> the buttons which initiate the click events are .person-view-btn and .person-vcard-btn
[23:11:20] <jyg> neither work when there are only one element per each of those two classes
[23:14:02] <Cork> jyg: make a demo on jsfiddle.net
[23:18:15] <anli> I want to filter an array with an oneliner, does jquery give me that?
[23:19:04] <anli> Oh, javascript had it already
[23:50:23] <jyg> Cork, thanks for noticing.  I just figured it out.  JS was fine.  It was a buried error in the PHP.
