[00:21:14] <marandi> hi guys , i coded a menu that have sub menu too , now i wanna hide submenu when mouse is out of menu and SUBMENU area .. how can i do that ?!
[00:51:08] <Cork> marandi: use mouseleave on the li wrapping the ul
[00:51:30] <HelperW> Yo
[00:51:36] <HelperW> Anyone a suggestion for this one?
[00:51:36] <HelperW> http://imgur.com/a/RfTIV
[00:51:57] <HelperW> I would like every 'day' before and after a red day orange
[00:52:07] <HelperW> and not clickable. What is the best way to select theym?
[00:54:49] <marandi> Cork: hey .. i cant because the two div are separated from each other !
[00:55:11] <Cork> marandi: then you're in for a lot of pain
[00:55:30] <Cork> it is doable, but not fun
[00:56:07] <Cork> HelperW: please don't ask ppl to edit images
[00:56:10] <Cork> make a fiddle
[00:56:56] <marandi> Cork: really ? :( cant i use two condition for mouseleave trigger !
[00:57:13] <Cork> marandi: you can't use mouseleave at all
[00:57:21] <Cork> as it depends on parent > child relation
[00:57:25] <marandi> Cork: i mean mouse out !
[00:57:40] <Cork> you can use mouse out, that is basically what you have to do
[00:57:53] <Cork> and then you have to keep track of the states and do all the relation work manually
[00:58:12] <forgotmynick> Does anyone know what this does? $('.submit:not(.disabled)').click(function() {$(this).parent('form').submit();return false;});
[00:58:27] <marandi> Cork: take a look at this please ..
[00:58:30] <marandi> Cork: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/11364820
[00:59:01] <Cork> forgotmynick: someone using an element with the class submit to do what should have been <input type="submit"> or <button type="submit">
[00:59:24] <Cork> (and through that breaking lots of browser features)
[00:59:54] <Cork> marandi: ok?
[01:00:10] <Cork> marandi: you most likley can't use classes like that (unless you only have it on one element)
[01:00:49] <HelperW> Ok, excuse me Cork : http://jsfiddle.net/nFq7A/  There you go I made a dummy version
[01:01:19] <zylophone> so, i've been chopping and changing some code, and now get an error from jquery's file - "typeerror: invalid 'in' operand a
[01:03:12] <marandi> Cork: i only have it on one element but clearly this kind of jquery command works great .. :( !
[01:03:18] <marandi> Cork: what do u suggest !?
[01:04:00] <xec> zylophone: look at the stack, what part of your code is it breaking at?
[01:06:09] <Cork> HelperW: after is fairly simple http://jsfiddle.net/nFq7A/1/
[01:06:23] <Cork> HelperW: before isn't doable with pure css
[01:06:51] <HelperW> true but I want to disable all actions
[01:07:04] <Cork> what actions?
[01:07:10] <HelperW> the are made clickable in my Wordpress plugin
[01:07:15] <HelperW> And I would like to disable that
[01:07:27] <Cork> then  you would have to look into what the plugin does
[01:07:43] <HelperW> It's such a mess to find that out so many js lines
[01:08:02] <HelperW> look Oo http://paste.jesse-obrien.ca/BP
[01:08:41] <zylophone> xec: it's a foreach, due to some big changes, i didn't catch that i was asking it to .foreach on a string! thanks
[01:09:53] <xec> you mean .each() ?
[01:10:00] <forgotmynick> Cork, thank you:-)
[01:10:13] <xec> in any case, glad you got it sorted :)
[01:10:35] <Cork> forgotmynick: heh, np
[01:21:19] <MacTrash> Hi. Does https://jqueryui.com/sortable/ only work on lists or can I use it on a div with a number of <a> elements as well?
[01:24:25] <n-a-n> hi all
[01:24:32] <Polar_> MacTrash: Look at the examples right side, "portlets"
[01:25:09] <zylophone> in a .foreach, if you change v, does it actually change the source element?
[01:25:39] <MacTrash> Polar_: ahh, thanks
[01:26:22] <Polar_> MacTrash: full api documentation http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/
[01:42:14] <jquery> I'm trying to extract HTML from an external page using an Ajax Get call. Problem is the HTML gets returned before the external page has a chance to completely render. So there are critical piece missing. Anyone know a way around this?
[01:42:43] <Cork> jquery: render?
[01:42:51] <Cork> content doesn't render on ajax calls
[01:43:29] <jquery> The external page uses JS / Handlebars to show dynamic data.
[01:43:53] <jquery> My app pulls the HTML from the page before their script has time to load the data.
[01:44:12] <xec> that doesn't make too much sense.
[01:44:19] <Cork> jquery: 1. you can only append what is inside body
[01:44:33] <Cork> jquery: so you need to include the libs the external page depends on
[01:44:36] <Cork> in this case handlebar
[01:44:57] <Cork> secondly you don't have ready or load events when you append fragments
[01:45:02] <jonkristian> Hm, i need to group pictures, anyone know of a good solution? At first i was thinking drag picture into group but it seems all of the scripts i found relied on jquery-ui. Then I came across this: http://mnmly.github.io/select-switch/
[01:45:02] <Cork> so the js needs to be built for that
[01:45:18] <Cork> jquery: if you follow those two rules you should be able to get it working
[01:45:21] <jquery> So there's no way to extract the HTML that their system creates dynamically?
[01:45:22] <jonkristian> Maybe takes longer time to group each picture, does anyone have any other ideas?
[01:45:34] <Cork> jquery: no
[01:45:41] <jquery> Ouch
[01:45:42] <Cork> jquery: you could try using an iframe
[01:46:16] <Cork> though the browsers xss block might prevent you there
[01:46:23] <jquery> Thats an option, but I'd need to control the interaction with elements inside the iframe.
[01:46:48] <Cork> jquery: you can if xss isn't blocking you
[01:46:55] <jquery> We're using special chrome flags that remove the XSS security
[01:47:09] <Cork> jquery: you REALLY shouldn't do that
[01:47:26] <Cork> it is extremely unsafe
[01:47:33] <Cork> for your users
[01:47:45] <jquery> Its not a consumer app
[01:48:10] <jquery> Its a temp application for a PGA Tour event thats displayed on a touch screen.
[01:48:14] <Cork> jquery: as long as the app never ever touches a domain you don't control it is fairly ok
[01:48:26] <jquery> Pulls data on the PGA tournament from their website
[01:48:47] <Cork> but really you should do this with a request proxy instead
[01:49:06] <Cork> removing the xss protection is like asking to have your password leaked
[01:49:24] <Cork> or account stolen at some site and... so on
[01:49:43] <jquery> Cork: Does that apply if noone can access the application but us?
[01:49:51] <Cork> jquery: yes
[01:50:00] <Cork> if you ever load content you don't control
[01:50:15] <Cork> if you own 100% of all the js, html that is ever loaded you are fairly safe
[01:50:55] <Cork> else a simple XMLHttpRequrest can send any data you can access to anywhere on the net
[01:51:25] <jquery> You said an Ajax GET request only displays content inside the body?
[01:51:45] <Cork> jquery: no i said fragments can only contain body
[01:51:55] <Cork> meaning you can only append body sections from a page
[01:51:59] <jquery> Ah ok
[01:52:29] <Cork> but yes internet browser security depends on xss to work at all
[01:52:35] <jquery> Well... its working somewhat except on pages that load dynamic data
[01:52:55] <Cork> if you disable that you state that you trust that nothing you ever load will ever want to try to steal anything from you
[01:53:17] <Cork> and that includes you local lan
[01:53:31] <Cork> or file://
[01:53:39] <Cork> aka. A BAD idea
[02:09:44] <mgco3> where do i find the ajax-link behavior in jquerymobile?
[02:27:50] <SprkDev> Anyone know the answer to this question? https://github.com/styoe/croppic/issues/10
[03:06:58] <bigbugjava> Hi, I have this issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22564783/openshift-file-upload-directory-none-function , I have decided to change the code to formidable, The thing is I dont know how to do it, when I have tried it with no success, anyone can support me of that matter?
[03:07:39] <brunoais> if only it was the DOM...
[03:23:04] <k_sze[work]> When using jQuery.ajax, what happens if some of the entries in the data object are arrays?
[03:23:36] <k_sze[work]> e.g. {foo: ['a', 'b', 'c']}
[03:23:57] <k_sze[work]> would it be converted to a query like foo=a&foo=b&foo=c?
[03:26:29] <Cork> k_sze[work]: yes
[03:27:04] <Cork> k_sze[work]: >>> $.param({ a: [1,2,3] })
[03:27:04] <Cork> "a%5B%5D=1&a%5B%5D=2&a%5B%5D=3"
[03:28:43] <k_sze[work]> hmm
[03:28:58] <k_sze[work]> not sure if Django would readily recognize that.
[03:29:57] <Cork> k_sze[work]: you prob want $.param({ 'a[]': [1,2,3] })
[03:30:05] <Cork> "a%5B%5D=1&a%5B%5D=2&a%5B%5D=3"
[03:32:20] <k_sze[work]> Which means that, for this rather simple case, you suggest that I try to access the POST parameter as 'foo[]' or 'a[]' in Django, instead of as 'foo' or 'a'?
[03:33:12] <Cork> k_sze[work]: no i just suggested that many servers expect the params to be key[]=v1&key[]=v2
[03:33:22] <Cork> and that it converts it to key=[v1,v2]
[03:33:31] <k_sze[work]> oh?
[03:33:38] <k_sze[work]> didn't know that.
[03:33:41] <k_sze[work]> let me ask the Django guys.
[03:33:45] <Cork> php does that for example
[03:33:55] <Cork> java is freer on the subject
[03:33:58] <Cork> ruby don't care
[03:34:19] <Cork> go and python don't care :)
[03:34:56] <xec> don't care as in "doesnt work" or as in "works with [] or without" ?
[03:35:04] <Cork> later
[03:35:33] <Cork> the last two is a bit different, as it depends on what you use to parse the params
[03:35:53] <Cork> and ya.. by ruby i meant rack
[03:37:04] <singh_> hey
[03:37:40] <singh_> http://jsbin.com/gufesifu/4/edit plz check it. i want to change background images with imageslider.
[03:38:12] <Cork> sigh someone broke jsbin again -_-'
[03:38:53] <xec> singh_: what's stopping you?
[03:39:30] <singh_> @xec--- nothing.......
[03:39:44] <xec> awesome :) glad we got that sorted then
[03:39:44] <Cork> heh...
[03:39:49] <Uhkis> :D
[03:40:10] <Cork> have some music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9NF2edxy-M
[03:40:31] <Polar_> lol
[03:40:50] <xec> i've seen that before, love the expression on the guy to the far right
[03:41:35] <Cork> xec: you mean like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4LhCv7RY4E ?
[03:42:10] <xec> lol
[03:43:19] <xec> "heeey" "hooo"
[04:23:32] <msafi> Say, I have this jquery $element, and I want to select the first direct child <span> of this element. How can I do it?
[04:23:57] <Cork> children('span').first()
[04:24:07] <msafi> Cork: Thanks!
[04:26:50] <slax0r> and first non-direct child would be closest?
[04:29:11] <Cork> .find
[04:29:28] <Cork> slax0r: .closest searches in the other direction (parents)
[04:29:35] <slax0r> does closest traverses up...oh...
[04:29:58] <slax0r> yeah, makes sense actually :)
[04:30:15] <slax0r> but do you need the .first?
[04:30:27] <Cork> slax0r: else you get all spans
[04:30:32] <Cork> not just the first one
[04:35:40] <msafi> Anyone know how to remove an element from both the DOM and memory so that references to it will be undefined or null?
[04:36:06] <Cork> msafi: you can't
[04:36:10] <slax0r> that would be hard
[04:36:13] <Cork> you don't have control of memory management
[04:36:22] <slax0r> how are you supposed to know that you need to clear var myVar?
[04:36:47] <Cork> slax0r: that isn't the problem
[04:37:04] <Cork> slax0r: gc is what handles the memory freeing and you arn't allowed to control it
[04:37:14] <msafi> What if I did $element.remove(); $element = undefined
[04:37:20] <Cork> slax0r: the gc frees the memory when you don't keep a reference to it
[04:37:33] <Cork> msafi: that is how you make it possible for gc to free it yes
[04:37:53] <Cork> msafi: if $element is in a function that will happen automatically though
[04:38:11] <msafi> Cork: if element is in a function?
[04:38:28] <Cork> (function() { var $element = $(); })() <--
[04:38:36] <Cork> $element will be freed when the function exits
[04:38:58] <Cork> cause no accessable space has access to it
[04:39:07] <slax0r> Cork: doesn't javascript copy the element into a different memory address as other languages does when you assign a variable?
[04:39:28] <Cork> slax0r: not sure what you mean
[04:39:47] <msafi> slax0r: objects such as DOM elements are copied by reference
[04:39:55] <msafi> "copied"*
[04:40:09] <Cork> dom elements is never copied
[04:40:14] <Cork> they are only referenced
[04:40:20] <slax0r> Cork: in php normally when you do: $someVar = $someOtherVar that is coppied in memory, if you unset the $someOtherVar, someVar is still normally set
[04:40:34] <slax0r> ah, makes sense
[04:40:38] <msafi> >> 'hey'
[04:40:38] <doberman> slax0r, but not if it's an object. :)
[04:40:41] <Cork> slax0r: objects is always handled by reference
[04:40:49] <Cork> natives isn't
[04:41:09] <Cork> var a = 1, b = a; b = 3; a == 1
[04:41:15] <slax0r> don't think that's the case in php, you need to assign it with & so that it's not copied, but only the address is copied
[04:41:24] <Cork> var a = { val: 1 }, b = a; b.val = 1; a.val == 3
[04:41:28] <Cork> opps
[04:41:31] <Cork> var a = { val: 1 }, b = a; b.val = 3; a.val == 3
[04:41:55] <Cork> ya, php works closer to how java and c++ works
[04:42:19] <Cork> on the other hand you have pointers too so...
[04:42:23] <slax0r> oh, so that objects is always handled by ref is meant for js :)
[04:42:25] <Cork> there isn't a generic answer :)
[04:42:33] <Cork> slax0r: yes
[04:42:50] <Cork> you have to copy the keys+values from the old object to a new one if you want to "clone" it
[04:42:56] <Cork> that is what $.extend does
[04:43:25] <slax0r> I've been doing js for ages, but still don't know how exaclty it works :)
[04:43:37] <Cork> var a = { val: 1 }, b = $.extend({}, a); b.val = 3; a.val === 1
[04:44:10] <Voyage> this is what I am getting in response of an ajax call. how do I iterate it to get each value? http://pastie.org/9119564
[04:44:59] <Cork> Voyage: $.each(data, function(obj) { $.each(obj, function(key, val) {  }) })
[04:45:41] <Cork> why you have one date as key and one as value is beyond me though
[04:45:54] <doberman> Cork, why 2 $.each() ?
[04:46:06] <Cork> dobalina: to handle the { key:value }
[04:46:31] <doberman> Ah, ok :)
[04:47:08] <Voyage> Cork,  there is no key , val though, just array
[04:47:18] <Cork> Voyage: there is
[04:47:24] <Cork> [] <-- array
[04:47:34] <Cork> {"2014-04-28 14:35:21.0":"2014-04-28 14:35:21.0"} <-- object
[04:47:39] <Voyage> Cork,  oh. the key is the value
[04:47:44] <Cork> with "2014-04-28 14:35:21.0": as key
[04:47:46] <Cork> and "2014-04-28 14:35:21.0" as value
[04:48:01] <Voyage> {"2014-04-28 14:35:21.0":"2014-04-28 14:35:21.0"}
[04:48:07] <Voyage> ya
[04:48:24] <Cork> if you don't need older ie you can do something like obj.keys[0]
[04:48:36] <Cork> or you could just fix the weird json
[04:48:50] <Voyage> Cork,  I had a list of strings in serverside. I just wanted to send the list but I think i had to use objects/key values pairs insidte the list
[04:48:56] <Voyage> as json object
[04:49:05] <Cork> no need
[04:50:05] <Cork> Voyage: http://pastie.org/9119575
[04:50:09] <Cork> that is what you want
[04:50:42] <msafi> If I do $('body').append('<span id="target"></span>') Then $('#target').remove(), will $('body').find('target').length be 0 or 1?
[04:51:21] <Cork> msafi: .find('#target').length will be 0
[04:51:31] <Cork> .find('target') will always be zero
[04:51:33] <msafi> Yes, sorry, typo
[04:52:36] <msafi> But I don't know why my angular/jQuery code isn't working like that. It's still able to find the element, even after I've .removed() it...
[04:54:23] <xec> holy crap cork, i've been lost at youtube all day because of your link :P
[04:54:38] <xec> Cork: ended up here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJInVT9B4RI
[04:54:56] <Cork> lol
[04:55:11] <msafi> Oh, I see what's happening, previous unit tests are inserting more elements…
[04:55:24] <Cork> xec: cool
[04:56:55] <Voyage> Cork, I am doing it in java code
[04:56:57] <Voyage> Cork,  http://pastie.org/9119587
[04:57:22] <Cork> Voyage: remove like 16
[04:57:28] <Cork> and move date to line 17
[04:57:38] <Cork> well and remove line 15
[04:58:11] <Voyage> k
[04:58:58] <Voyage> Cork, ok, now I have a single array object. how do i itereate
[04:59:08] <Voyage> in client end
[04:59:25] <Cork> Voyage: $.each(data, function(date) {})
[04:59:58] <Cork> date will be the string
[05:01:31] <Voyage> Cork,  thanks
[05:01:48] <Cork> np
[05:17:52] <bberry> why do people wrap code in this: jquery(function($){ //code here })
[05:18:01] <bberry> what does that do exactly?
[05:19:44] <Cork> bberry: it is a short hand for ready
[05:19:52] <Cork> AND it makes sure $ is jQuery
[05:20:51] <Voyage> Cork,  in  $.each(data, function(date) {}) , what is the first data and what is the second data?
[05:20:58] <slax0r> jquery and jQuery are the same?
[05:21:11] <Cork> Voyage: datA and datE
[05:21:12] <Cork> :)
[05:21:50] <Voyage> oops
[05:21:51] <Cork> slax0r: no, i just assumed he made it lower case
[05:22:07] <Cork> or jquery is a variable defiend from noConflict()
[05:22:25] <bberry> Cork: gotcha. thanks :D
[05:30:22] <Voyage> Cork,  http://pastie.org/9119660
[05:32:16] <Cork> Voyage: ?
[05:32:47] <Cork> Voyage: btw you don't need to set value if the content of the option is the same
[05:36:41] <Voyage> Cork,  well it was not working out.
[05:36:47] <Voyage> the paste i mean
[05:37:04] <Voyage> Cork,  and I need to values to be exact as the content. (ignore that) :)
[05:37:52] <Voyage> it does not changes the html of the option box
[05:37:53] <Cork> Voyage: not sure what you mean
[05:38:29] <Cork> Voyage: make sure you don't have two elements with the same id
[05:38:40] <Voyage> k
[05:39:29] <Voyage> Cork,  not geting the alert either for.   $.each(response, function(date) {
[05:39:29] <Voyage>                        alert(date);
[05:39:58] <Cork> Voyage: before the each check alert(typeof(response))
[05:40:26] <Voyage> this works:  alert(response);
[05:40:35] <Cork> and you see all the values?
[05:41:01] <Cork> if yes, then your server is sending html not json
[05:41:03] <Voyage> it says string
[05:41:10] <Voyage> yes. I see values.
[05:41:17] <Cork> it needs to set Content-Type: application/json
[05:41:37] <Cork> else jquery won't know what data your sending and assuming it is plain text
[05:42:27] <Voyage> it says ["2014-04-28 14:37:59.0"]
[05:42:48] <Cork> ya, so it is a string
[05:42:49] <Cork> not json
[05:43:40] <Cork> you want setContentType("application/json");
[05:43:43] <Voyage> response.setHeader( "Content-Type:" , "application/json");
[05:50:44] <DarsVaeda> how well is the paste event supported? and where do I find documentation about it?
[05:51:25] <DarsVaeda> I try to do something .on('paste') but in firefox that only happens if I paste two times "change" works, it is an input textfield
[05:52:20] <Cork> DarsVaeda: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/cutcopypaste.html
[05:53:20] <Cork> ugg quirksmode need to update its charts :/
[05:53:23] <DarsVaeda> oh boy that is a lot of red
[05:53:42] <Cork> DarsVaeda: baiscally only opera
[05:54:20] <Cork> (is read i mean)
[05:56:08] <Voyage> working on it
[05:56:26] <DarsVaeda> hmm still does not really work, ah whatever I drop that idea I think
[05:56:50] <Cork> DarsVaeda: what doesn't work?
[05:58:15] <DarsVaeda> hmm actually it does
[05:58:22] <DarsVaeda>  /me scratches his head
[05:58:31] <DarsVaeda> hrm
[06:00:11] <Voyage> Cork,  type of response is object now. but it shows "0" on alert or insertion in option list. http://pastie.org/9119748
[06:00:57] <Cork> Voyage: wooops
[06:01:13] <Cork> Voyage: ya sorry $.each gives you index as the first argument to the function
[06:01:16] <Cork> not the value
[06:01:39] <Cork> Voyage: either do function(index, date) {}
[06:01:45] <Cork> or use "this" instead
[06:02:18] <Cork> Voyage: sorry for the mixup but i have a hard time remembering witch one of $.map and $.each gives value as the first argument :/
[06:03:15] <DarsVaeda> http://jsfiddle.net/7LSTh/1/
[06:03:53] <DarsVaeda> I made a fiddle, the event fires but it only loads on focusout seemingly
[06:05:37] <Voyage> Cork,  so I just replace $.each(response, function(date) {       with   $.each(response, function(index, date) {
[06:05:41] <Voyage> ?
[06:05:47] <Cork> Voyage: yes
[06:06:16] <Voyage> works. thx
[06:07:21] <Cork> DarsVaeda: paste fires BEFORE the value is in the field
[06:07:34] <DarsVaeda> ya just found out too
[06:07:35] <Cork> DarsVaeda: it is meant to allow the site to modify the data before it is added
[06:07:45] <Cork> ex. remove ms word formating
[06:07:54] <DarsVaeda> ah oky is there on for after the paste?
[06:08:00] <Cork> no
[06:08:04] <DarsVaeda> snap
[06:08:05] <Cork> but the content exist in event
[06:14:18] <Cork> DarsVaeda: there is another option though
[06:14:55] <Cork> DarsVaeda: http://jsfiddle.net/7LSTh/3/
[06:15:14] <Cork> DarsVaeda: don't handle it :D
[06:15:42] <Cork> though you might want to rate limit it
[06:16:12] <decx> there's a paste event?
[06:16:15] <decx> huh
[06:16:17] <DarsVaeda> what is input now?
[06:16:30] <DarsVaeda> I just found something with getting the clipboard text
[06:20:22] <Cork> DarsVaeda: its and event that fires on user input
[06:20:39] <Cork> kinda like keydown but after the value has been added to the field
[06:20:45] <Cork> decx: has been for a long time now
[06:21:35] <DarsVaeda> actually it seems to be fired when an element is changed through the ui
[06:21:46] <DarsVaeda> at least according to this page http://help.dottoro.com/ljhxklln.php
[06:23:10] <DarsVaeda> but anyway thanks :)
[06:23:10] <Cork> DarsVaeda: yes like keydown
[06:23:41] <Cork> DarsVaeda: also a simple rate limiter http://jsfiddle.net/7LSTh/5/
[06:25:17] <DarsVaeda> why limit it?
[06:26:21] <Cork> DarsVaeda: cause input fires after each character is typed
[06:26:45] <Cork> DarsVaeda: it is normally a good idea to wait until the user stops typing
[06:26:46] <DarsVaeda> ah didn't try that yet
[06:27:02] <Cork> 3000 was just a random number from me
[06:27:10] <Cork> 1000 or even less might be what you want
[06:27:11] <Cork> 500?
[06:27:24] <krambiorix> what am i doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/AGdjL/
[06:27:42] <Cork> but a limit is normally desired
[06:28:28] <Cork> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/AGdjL/1/
[06:28:33] <Cork> krambiorix: you don't use keys on arrays
[06:28:57] <DarsVaeda> your right, I don't want to get a phone call from google
[06:28:59] <DarsVaeda> again :D
[06:29:06] <Cork> lol
[06:29:53] <Cork> DarsVaeda: not so much that as you will exhaust the number of simultaneous connections
[06:30:14] <Cork> (depending on how fast the user types)
[06:30:32] <DarsVaeda> not that fast, at least these users ^^
[06:39:25] <krambiorix> Cork, thanks!
[06:39:33] <Cork> np
[06:44:36] <FernandoBasso> Why would var menuLat = $( '#menu-lat' ); var right = menuLat[ 0 ].style.right; work from firebug console, but not from my script? From the script, console.log( right ) just says "an empty string"...
[06:45:20] <Cork> FernandoBasso: you might run it before it is set
[06:45:41] <Cork> also you can just use  $( '#menu-lat' ).css('right')
[06:45:56] <FernandoBasso> .css() gives me px, and I need percentages.
[06:46:13] <FernandoBasso> Also, it is for sure being loaded after the page is fully loaded.
[06:46:27] <Cork> then it should work
[06:47:26] <FernandoBasso> I noticed that after I click the second in the button responsible for triggering the js, it does get the values. Let me double check my stuff here...
[06:47:50] <Cork> right
[06:48:02] <Cork> opps
[06:48:10] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/vex6L/
[06:48:15] <Cork> stypid clipboard...
[06:49:05] <FernandoBasso> http://www.senhormadrugada.com.br/mobile/evento/25/sunset-sessions-tardes-de-som-e-sol-beehive-cl <-- It should console.log() the value when clicking on the menu on ther far right.
[06:50:19] <FernandoBasso> The css is there: #menu-lat { right: -40%; }
[06:50:35] <FernandoBasso> Perhaps it only works if it is set inline.
[06:51:04] <FernandoBasso> Because after I click on the button, js does set it inline, which makes it work in the subsequent clicks.
[06:51:38] <FernandoBasso> Or I'll have to use some math to convert px to percentages, and use $('#menu-lat').css( 'right' );
[06:55:14] <FernandoBasso> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/vex6L/1/
[06:55:38] <Cork> FernandoBasso: that is in the stylesheet
[06:55:41] <Cork> not in .style
[06:56:04] <Cork> FernandoBasso: .style.right can only access inline style values
[06:57:14] <FernandoBasso> All right. Thanks.
[07:05:25] <sahbeewah> what's the best way to call a non-global function if you only have the name of the function (string)?
[07:06:00] <Cork> sahbeewah: do you have access to the function?
[07:06:15] <Cork> cause if it isn't in your scope you can't call it
[07:06:43] <sahbeewah> suppose you did
[07:07:22] <Cork> well best would be something like var funcs = {}; funcs.<name> = function() {}; funcs[str]();
[07:07:37] <Cork> if the function isn't on an object your only option is Function or eval
[07:09:00] <sahbeewah> can you elaborate on Function?
[07:13:05] <Cork> sahbeewah: is is basically the same as eval
[07:13:14] <Cork> except it gives you a function from the evaluation
[07:13:23] <Cork> instead of running it in place
[07:13:51] <Cork> var c = new Function(str + '()')); c()
[07:14:04] <Cork> vs eval(str + '()')
[07:15:41] <sahbeewah> i see. but that doesn't work
[07:15:54] <sahbeewah> only the eval way works in this situation i think
[07:16:12] <Cork> i don
[07:16:25] <Cork> *'t know the situation so can't say
[07:17:31] <sahbeewah> accidentally coded my way into this problem at work... needed to restructure to get around it
[07:17:37] <sahbeewah> here's a snippet: http://jsfiddle.net/7n98j/
[07:18:07] <Cork> sahbeewah: just change it a little bit
[07:18:52] <Cork> sahbeewah: http://jsfiddle.net/7n98j/1/
[07:19:58] <sahbeewah> hehe... yes, unfortunately you don't always get the luxury of modifying the structure like that
[07:20:13] <sahbeewah> so you need to work with what you have
[07:20:48] <Cork> sahbeewah: then create the object from the function names
[07:21:46] <Cork> funcs
[07:21:48] <Cork> bah
[07:21:51] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/7n98j/2/
[07:25:09] <sahbeewah> that's, pretty much the same thing
[07:41:23] <johnson_> hello
[07:41:43] <johnson_> i want to write a custom jquery plugin
[07:42:49] <johnson_> so i made a new file and added this to the file: (function($) { $.fn.validateTasklist = function() {     	 //validate here      }; }(jQuery));
[07:43:41] <johnson_> then i have a button and checks if it is pressed then it should call the plugin method
[07:43:58] <johnson_> how do i do that?
[07:46:37] <sahbeewah> johnson_, from the looks of it, you don't need a plugin. just use a function.
[07:47:01] <johnson_> but i have to use a plugin:/
[07:48:07] <sahbeewah> how did you intend on calling your plugin? on a form element?
[07:48:21] <bberry> if i am changing the src of an image, do i want to use prop or attr?
[07:48:23] <sahbeewah> or 'ul' element?
[07:48:36] <sacho> bberry, prop, usually
[07:49:20] <bberry> (jquery 2.0+)
[07:49:22] <bberry> kk
[07:49:27] <bberry> ty sacho
[07:53:33] <decx> shouldnt make any difference for changing src
[07:54:45] <dazaweb> would there be any reason that $.ajax could not find an endpoint such as http://devserver.com/documentation/business ?
[07:55:08] <Cork> dazaweb: no that is just a string to js
[07:55:23] <Cork> dazaweb: the browser might prevent you if the target is another domain though
[07:55:26] <Cork> (then your own)
[07:56:03] <dazaweb> Cork: yeah, it's not cors, it's actually giving me a 404, only from the ajax request, not if I navigate in browser, must be something else
[07:57:37] <Cork> dazaweb: the server might be checking for the xhr request header
[07:57:45] <Cork> and actively blocking it
[07:58:53] <dazaweb> Cork: K, i'll look into that but xhrField: {withCredentials:true} should manage that, correct?
[07:58:53] <thebope> I'm trying to disable a button. I have a function disableButton(button) { $(button).attr('disabled', true): } and a call disableButton('#button')
[07:59:08] <thebope> Following in the debugger, I see that the button seems to be identified and sent to the method properly
[07:59:11] <Cork> dazaweb: no
[07:59:15] <thebope> however the method does not disable the button
[07:59:24] <thebope> I've also tried addClass("disabled")
[07:59:47] <sahbeewah> thebope, $(button).attr('disabled', 'disabled'):
[07:59:56] <thebope> thanks sahbeewah I will try that
[08:00:21] <thebope> sahbeewah, conversely, can I use attr('disabled', 'enabled')?
[08:00:29] <Cork> dazaweb: jquery adds X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
[08:00:37] <Cork> dazaweb: the server can potetially look for that
[08:01:02] <Cork> sahbeewah, thebope: DON'T use attr for state changes
[08:01:04] <Cork> use prop
[08:01:16] <Cork> prop('disabled', true) / prop('disabled', false)
[08:01:20] <thebope> Cork okay
[08:01:26] <thebope> I'll try that, attr didn't work
[08:01:48] <Cork> attr works in browsers that check dynamic attribute changes
[08:01:52] <Cork> but not all browsers do
[08:02:33] <dazaweb> cork: cool thanks, i'll dive deeper. I have access to other endpoints on the server, so I would think all endpoint would work
[08:02:59] <Cork> dazaweb: the url is just a string to jquery
[08:03:03] <thebope> Cork, damn that's not working either
[08:03:05] <Cork> dazaweb: it doesn't care about the content
[08:03:12] <thebope> I'm using Chrome, which should be relatively modern
[08:03:23] <Cork> thebope: are you trying to toggle a jquery ui button or something?
[08:03:57] <thebope> <button id="button" class="btn btn-blue"> yada yada
[08:04:07] <thebope> I believe there are bootstrap styles associated with it
[08:04:15] <thebope> Or, I mean, I know there are
[08:05:29] <Cork> thebope: http://jsfiddle.net/JW39X/
[08:05:48] <Cork> thebope: ah, ya that is the same situation as if it was jquery ui
[08:06:06] <Cork> thebope: you most likely have to find a function in the plugin to call
[08:06:47] <thebope> Cork, hmmm
[08:06:55] <thebope> Your example works well
[08:07:06] <Cork> ya, but it is a native button
[08:07:19] <thebope> yea, I'm going to try to find out how the buttons being generated
[08:08:02] <Cork> thebope: http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#buttons-usage
[08:08:29] <thebope> Cork, oh sweet, thanks, let me try that
[08:08:30] <Cork> thebope: might just be that you have to style the disabled look
[08:08:35] <yash069> how to load local xml file using jquery ....
[08:08:47] <Cork> cause it looks like bootstrap uses the normal button
[08:08:54] <Cork> yash069: normally you can't
[08:08:54] <yash069> i tried $.ajax but its giving CORS error
[08:09:06] <Cork> yash069: you would have to use the <input type="file">
[08:09:32] <xckpd7> question: is this the most efficient way to do this? http://jsfiddle.net/sNh6c/10/
[08:10:03] <xckpd7> I'm basically checking window.scrollY on scroll and conditionally doing slideUp or slideDown
[08:10:38] <xckpd7> but I keep doing slideDown or slideUp when I don't need it. I just need it to execute when it crosses the threshold
[08:10:51] <Cork> xckpd7: use scrollTop not scrollY
[08:10:58] <Cork> not sure how cross browser scrollY is
[08:11:13] <xckpd7> ok
[08:11:39] <Cork> xckpd7: hmm actually
[08:11:49] <thebope> Cork, Yea I think that might be the case actually
[08:12:03] <Cork> xckpd7: scratch that, scrollTop IS scrollY on window ^^'
[08:12:17] <Cork> xckpd7: so ya, what your doing is as good as it gets
[08:13:11] <xckpd7> I wonder if instead of using greater than / less than
[08:13:33] <xckpd7> I could do one if it equals 500px, and the other if it equals 499px
[08:13:41] <xckpd7> that way nothing is executing at 900px
[08:15:05] <Cork> xckpd7: what is the 500px meant to be about?
[08:15:46] <forgotmynick> A button with the id opener uses this to bring up a box: $( "#opener" ).click(function() {$( "#contact-modal" ).dialog("open" );}); -- how can I get this dialog open from another button?
[08:16:16] <Cork> forgotmynick: $( "#opener" ).click()
[08:16:21] <forgotmynick> I have tried to use onclick event for <button> but I get "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token } "
[08:17:35] <Cork> then you need to fix the syntax error
[08:18:04] <forgotmynick> I see what I did wrong, I was using the wrong quotes :P
[08:22:34] <xckpd7> Cork: I want something to appear on the page. when the user scrolls 500px or so, I want the "something" to hide.
[08:22:46] <xckpd7> Cork: when they scroll back to 499px, I want the something to show again
[08:23:04] <xckpd7> so now I'm doing a conditional. if ( window.scrollY > 500 )
[08:23:20] <xckpd7> but that executes on 500, 600, 700, 800. I'm thinking about performanc
[08:23:45] <xckpd7> wondering if I can't just only check for 499 and 500 and be performance friendly
[08:24:13] <Cork> xckpd7: so you want it to show for every 500px?
[08:24:21] <Cork> or just when passing 500px from the top?
[08:24:45] <Cork> my question was where the 500px came from
[08:25:54] <xckpd7> arbitrary :)
[08:26:08] <xckpd7> just passing 500px from the top
[08:26:42] <xckpd7> it seems like scrollY won't always give all the points it passes... so I can't just do == 500
[08:26:44] <Cork> xckpd7: ok, the reason i asked was so you didn't want something like viewport height or something :)
[08:27:14] <Cork> xckpd7: ya, you can set a bool if you care a lot about performance
[08:28:45] <repxl> how to replace data from ajax so the on. "click" event don't get corrupted ...
[08:29:59] <Cork> xckpd7: http://jsfiddle.net/sNh6c/17/
[08:30:19] <Cork> repxl: corrupted??
[08:31:22] <repxl> Cork right now my $("#paginate a").on("click", function(e) event runs only once because i replacing the #paginate a with new updated so how to do it so my click event will work more than once.
[08:31:54] <Cork> repxl: read api.jquery.com/on
[08:32:04] <Cork> check the delegate section
[08:33:47] <repxl> Cork hmm i need this ? http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[08:34:01] <Cork> repxl: no you can do that with on too
[08:34:26] <repxl> Cork so use .on but use 3 params ("td", "click", function())
[08:34:40] <Cork> no check the doc :)
[08:34:52] <Cork> your almost there but the selector is the second argument
[08:37:02] <repxl> Cork $("#paginate").on("click", "a", function(e)   it still runs only once
[08:37:29] <Cork> repxl: if you replace #paginate you can't bind on it
[08:37:36] <Cork> as the listener will be removed when you replace it
[08:37:49] <Cork> you need to bind it on a static element
[08:39:21] <repxl> Cork ok works ..
[08:40:49] <duch_kazatel> goooood morning #jquery
[08:42:58] <StephenS> http://jsfiddle.net/hmelenok/WM6Gq/ this works only for one textarea, I have 10 textareas with class="realtext" so how can I make jquery to work for all 10 textareas.?
[08:44:22] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/WM6Gq/2/ updated StephenS to actually use jsfiddle's features :)
[08:44:42] <StephenS> I tried with getElementsByClassName method
[08:44:57] <duch_kazatel> StephenS are you using jQuery on the page?
[08:45:03] <duch_kazatel> or are you using raw javascript?
[08:45:06] <StephenS> Yes
[08:45:14] <StephenS> I use jQuery, but typed in js :)
[08:45:36] <duch_kazatel> then do $('.realtext').each(function(){});
[08:45:59] <duch_kazatel> or, if you use getElementsByClassName, enumerate over the returned collection of nodes.
[08:46:45] <duch_kazatel> also, don't call your javascript from your HTML like you were.
[08:47:05] <StephenS> give me example
[08:47:59] <duch_kazatel> use either $(document).on('ready', function(){}); or $(document).ready(function(){}); or $(function(){});
[08:48:12] <duch_kazatel> put your code in the curlies in any of those examples.
[08:48:17] <StephenS> not that ugh
[08:48:20] <StephenS> I know all those stuff
[08:48:25] <StephenS> I don't know how to make it expand in jQuery
[08:48:31] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[08:48:32] <Cork> StephenS: have you thought about just using a contentEditable field?
[08:48:41] <StephenS> no
[08:48:55] <StephenS> resize:none; in css.
[08:49:04] <StephenS> and html5 is not supported.
[08:49:18] <duch_kazatel> StephenS you can use normal javascript inside of the jquery document ready.
[08:49:35] <StephenS> yeah but its getting textarea by ID
[08:49:41] <StephenS> so only one textarea per page.
[08:50:13] <duch_kazatel> right - so make it use classes...
[08:50:31] <Cork> StephenS: http://jsfiddle.net/cAVwR/
[08:50:54] <Cork> :)
[08:51:53] <StephenS> you mean to make it inside css?
[08:51:55] <duch_kazatel> in fact, this doesn't even require enumeration of any kind...
[08:51:57] <StephenS> Good idea I must admit ;)
[08:52:09] <Cork> StephenS: the check the element in the html section
[08:52:16] <Cork> it isn't a textarea
[08:57:15] <repxl> lol
[08:57:21] <repxl> chrome don' support ajax
[08:57:31] <repxl> at least it support but u still see a little tiny refresh
[08:57:41] <repxl> only firefox is clean with zero refresh
[08:57:48] <repxl> did anyone noticed this ?
[08:58:26] <lior> hey so when I call this it only affects one of the arrows and not both (when both include the data attr) I tried it with a class too
[08:58:35] <lior> $("[data-arrowRight]").css("color","white");
[08:59:45] <lior> am I doing something wrong here?
[08:59:45] <duch_kazatel> repxl huh?
[09:00:10] <lior> huh?
[09:01:15] <repxl> duch_kazatel yea go to google try to type in something you search than scroll down where the pagination is and try to use it you will notice a small "refresh" when u look at the favicon     try the same thing in firefox and you will see a "clean no refresh"
[09:01:41] <duch_kazatel> repxl right - chrome notifies you via the icon that it's refreshing content on the page.
[09:01:45] <duch_kazatel> it's still doing ajax.
[09:02:05] <duch_kazatel> lior can you share your code?
[09:02:23] <lior> ya
[09:02:36] <repxl> duch_kazatel ye its doing that's why i was wondering ok since it is only notice purpose its okey thx ;)
[09:03:11] <lior> http://pastebin.com/C1cAKfjL
[09:03:36] <StephenS> hmm contentEditable="true" does not work for me on textarea.
[09:03:39] <lior> that is the html and jquery
[09:03:52] <duch_kazatel> !g mdn contentEditable
[09:03:53] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Content Editable - Web developer guide | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_Editable
[09:04:07] <StephenS> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/cAVwR/1/
[09:04:16] <duch_kazatel> lior this.$("[data-arrowLeft]") - what is this?
[09:04:32] <lior> this is the way I get to jquery
[09:04:39] <duch_kazatel> $("[data-arrowLeft]")
[09:04:40] <decx> that text area is totally contenteditable ^^
[09:04:42] <thebope> Cork, thanks for your help before, I got everything to work eventually
[09:04:42] <duch_kazatel> that should be enough.
[09:04:47] <duch_kazatel> brb
[09:05:02] <erming> Lets say I hook two "click" events on an object. Is there any way tag my events with some kind of name/ID. I need to be able to delete only one of them later on
[09:05:10] <erming> i can tag*
[09:06:15] <erming> nvm, found a solution (which was to _not_ use anon functions)
[09:07:31] <duch_kazatel> back.
[09:08:31] <lior> it doesnt work like that this.$ is the same as $ but besides that should I need to do anything else?
[09:08:57] <duch_kazatel> lior that's... really strange.
[09:09:09] <lior> yeah idk it is backbone
[09:09:22] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah, okay.
[09:09:33] <duch_kazatel> normally, you can just use the attribute selector and things work fine.
[09:09:40] <StephenS> got any idea why textarea does not expand?
[09:09:57] <lior> hm kk ill try some stuff out thanks
[09:10:17] <duch_kazatel> StephenS why are you putting contenteditable on something that doesn't need it?
[09:10:35] <tristan1990> Okay. I want to make an upload form that will upload word documents. When it is uploaded I want it to display in a nice grid - anybody any ideas where to start with this?
[09:10:39] <StephenS> textarea need it.
[09:10:49] <duch_kazatel> StephenS nope.  doesn't.
[09:10:57] <Ownix> tristan1990: what technologies are you using?
[09:10:57] <duch_kazatel> tristan1990 start with forms :)
[09:11:16] <StephenS> ?
[09:11:35] <tristan1990> Ownix duch_kazatel I've not decided what tech to use yet. Thinking just html/javascript/jquery
[09:11:46] <StephenS> oh
[09:11:46] <StephenS> ic
[09:13:07] <tristan1990> If I used this - http://www.dropzonejs.com/ - would it be difficult to display all uploaded items in a grid?
[09:13:25] <duch_kazatel> what are you displaying in that grid?
[09:13:32] <Ownix> tristan1990: you have to have a server to store the files on
[09:14:10] <tristan1990> I do have a server
[09:14:11] <brunoais> Ownix, That's when the files are uploaded, though
[09:14:17] <tristan1990> cpanel/apache
[09:14:27] <Ownix> cpanel...
[09:14:29] <Ownix> anyways
[09:14:30] <brunoais> tristan1990, in which language is the code in the server?
[09:14:41] <brunoais> the code that receives the files
[09:14:43] <Ownix> Yeah you can use dropzone but when you a drop a file it immediately starts uploading to apache
[09:14:44] <tristan1990> php
[09:14:53] <Ownix> er... not apache but the server the webpage sits on
[09:15:03] <Ownix> So youre going to have a PHP backend then?
[09:15:34] <brunoais> tristan1990, is that what you want? -> "drop a file it immediately starts uploading"
[09:16:00] <duch_kazatel> let's get more basic with it - tristan1990, what is your end goal?  what's the grid you were talking about?
[09:16:03] <tristan1990> ermm actually no thats not what I want. Sorry. I just liked how nice dropzone looked
[09:16:45] <brunoais> -_-'
[09:16:53] <brunoais> just copy the CSS, then
[09:18:03] <tristan1990> Okay, you may have some better suggestions for this. I have one document that a lot of people use across many schools in the UK. I'd like to make a "hub" for this so that people can download the "Master Document" and make changes to it, then upload it back to the site with their Name tagged on it. All the uploaded docs need to be displayed underneath the Master Document
[09:18:13] <duch_kazatel> google docs.
[09:18:22] <tristan1990> So people can remix the master document and other people can access it in an open source way
[09:18:33] <duch_kazatel> OR dropbox.  or some other system.
[09:18:57] <tristan1990> I don't want people to have some sort of login to do it, anybody should be able to submit a document
[09:19:22] <duch_kazatel> that's a highly ambitious project.  how are you going to manage merging things?
[09:19:28] <brunoais> and how do you expect the information about who uploaded to stay minimally correct that way?
[09:19:29] <decx> stick with google docs, anything like that you try to build from scratch is going to take hundreds of hours
[09:19:33] <brunoais> tristan1990, ^
[09:20:04] <tristan1990> Not bothered about merging things, its just about having a number of documents that people can use instead of the master
[09:20:15] <tristan1990> Is there a nice way I could embed google docs?
[09:20:33] <duch_kazatel> tristan1990 " its just about having a number of documents that people can use instead of the master" - huh?
[09:20:46] <decx> if you just want a master any versioning system will do
[09:21:45] <duch_kazatel> this is a great example of "don't reinvent the wheel"
[09:22:44] <tristan1990> Yes I'm starting to think so, i've been thinking of some inventive ways of doing this when actually Google Docs would do just fine. Do you know if there is a way for people to submit a google doc to my google docs folder on the website>
[09:23:03] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, or better: Make sure you know exactly what you want. not just some general ideas
[09:23:25] <brunoais> tristan1990, read the manual ;)
[09:23:31] <duch_kazatel> brunoais i think they know what they want, they just aren't aware of the stuff that goes into making something like that.
[09:23:40] <brunoais> Oh
[09:23:46] <tristan1990> brunoais what manual?
[09:23:57] <brunoais> tristan1990, google drive manual
[09:24:07] <brunoais> checkout the section about sharing
[09:24:14] <decx> i guess searching google docs docs isnt that fruitful
[09:24:17] <tristan1990> Okay will do, cheers
[09:24:24] <tristan1990> I'll try and find it
[09:24:39] <Brycetron> @duch_kazatel Good morning!
[09:24:40] <duch_kazatel> tristan1990 what is this whole system for?
[09:24:46] <duch_kazatel> good morning Brycetron
[09:25:42] <tristan1990> Its for a ICT/Computing curriculum in the UK. Basically somebody has written really good schemes of work to teach high school kids and we want to make it open source, so people can change and edit it, then share their version
[09:26:20] <duch_kazatel> tristan1990 yeah, you need something like google docs or even github for that.
[09:26:48] <tristan1990> I immediately thought github, although I don't think most people will know how to use it over the command line
[09:27:09] <tristan1990> most people using it will be school teachers, so it needs to be simple
[09:27:14] <duch_kazatel> there are also apps for the desktop.  if that's not the route you want to go, gdocs or any other similar service.
[09:27:21] <decx> google docs is pretty big on collaborative (collaboratorive?) document editing
[09:27:37] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, gitextensions does the job just fine ;)
[09:27:50] <brunoais> I've useing it for a while
[09:27:58] <brunoais> it is quite good and quite complete
[09:28:05] <brunoais> it does not have the really advanced stuff
[09:28:06] <duch_kazatel> they don't want collaborative document editing i don't think - they want to let people download a "master" file, edit it, and then upload the edited copy.
[09:28:12] <brunoais> but those are rarely used
[09:28:23] <brunoais> yeah
[09:28:24] <duch_kazatel> brunoais i prefer using the raw command line, but most teachers need a very simple point and click interface.
[09:28:33] <brunoais> true
[09:28:41] <brunoais> I usually use the GUI
[09:28:55] <brunoais> but, sometimes I jump in to the commandline
[09:29:04] <brunoais> depends on what I want and my mood :S
[09:29:07] <duch_kazatel> i always use the command line these days.
[09:29:08] <brunoais> *:)
[09:29:38] <decx> you got a pimple on your face
[09:30:03] <brunoais> ups
[09:30:06] <brunoais> :)
[09:30:07] <brunoais> there
[09:30:09] <tristan1990> I use the command line with git too, it's just whether people can submit google docs to me so I can display them nicely
[09:30:40] <duch_kazatel> tristan1990 that kind of system is going to require a little oversight i'll bet.
[09:30:59] <tristan1990> how do you mean?
[09:31:02] <tristan1990> oh
[09:31:06] <tristan1990> administering
[09:31:46] <decx> resurrect the concept of a mailing list
[09:32:08] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[09:33:08] <thebope> there are people who don't know how to use github through the command line?
[09:33:10] <thebope> blashphemy
[09:33:17] <thebope> blashphemy lol
[09:33:19] <thebope> blasphemy!
[09:33:26] <duch_kazatel> hahaha blash!
[09:33:36] <jrajav> blashpemy
[09:33:41] <thebope> bashphemy
[09:33:47] <thebope> more accurate ;-)
[09:33:50] <duch_kazatel> ++
[09:33:51] <duch_kazatel> that's awesome.
[09:34:07] <jrajav> bashphlegmy
[09:34:07] <tristan1990> GitHub really would be perfect for this
[09:34:15] <duch_kazatel> almost.
[09:34:21] <thebope> lol
[09:34:24] <tristan1990> Is there a web version of GitHub I can use on my site
[09:49:33] <waspinator> I'm trying to return get some json data working in jsfiddle but it seems to be returning an object instead of plain text. any ideas?
[09:49:34] <waspinator> http://jsfiddle.net/JmAWt/3/
[09:50:26] <duch_kazatel> you're getting json, not text?
[09:51:38] <waspinator> I'm getting a js object, but I just want plain text
[09:53:03] <waspinator> text with a header of 'Content-Type: application/json' is what fullcalendar expects
[09:54:14] <duch_kazatel> that seems really strange.
[09:55:06] <waspinator> that fullcalendar would want plain text instead of a js object?
[09:55:24] <duch_kazatel> that it would want text, but not have the content-type match
[09:55:52] <BillCriswell> That just confuses everything.
[09:56:54] <duch_kazatel> seriously.
[09:58:44] <waspinator> I must be misunderstanding it. but on my own development server I have a php function that returns http://pastebin.com/4B15S1S4 and it seems to work
[09:59:27] <duch_kazatel> that's not text, that's JSON.
[09:59:49] <duch_kazatel> well, technically it's an array of objects, but you get the idea.
[10:01:38] <waspinator> okay, so can I make jsfiddle emulate that response? I tried but it doesn't seem to poplate the calendar
[10:03:10] <xckpd7> question... how do I go about figuring out performance of certain things
[10:03:34] <xckpd7> how would I figure out what performance hit is running slideDown on something that is already slideDown?
[10:03:51] <xckpd7> or running slideUp on something that is already slid up?
[10:04:10] <waspinator> try firefox's profiler maybe
[10:04:51] <duch_kazatel> chrome has one, as we..
[10:06:42] <mi6x3m> hely jquery, is there a way to slide the footer ?
[10:06:46] <mi6x3m> an easy stable way
[10:06:53] <xckpd7> any resources on using chrome profiler? never done it
[10:07:08] <duch_kazatel> https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/cpu-profiling
[10:08:36] <waspinator> firefox version: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Profiler
[10:08:56] <duch_kazatel> firebug has one, as well.
[10:14:22] <waspinator> any ideas on how to return a JSON request in jsfiddle? the fiddle.jshell.net/echo/json/ url just gives me {}
[10:14:32] <waspinator> http://jsfiddle.net/JmAWt/3/
[10:15:45] <duch_kazatel> waspinator i'm seeing the echo contain the object you want.
[10:15:50] <duch_kazatel> are you looking in your console?
[10:16:59] <waspinator> yes, I see the object. but it's just being sent to console right now. I need it sent to a url where fullcalendar can read it from
[10:17:44] <waspinator> if you change the month in fullcalendar it will request new data, but the response will be {}
[10:26:53] <BillCriswell> I'm a fucking idiot sometimes.
[10:27:43] <BillCriswell> Assumed after including Hammer.js and jquery.hammer.js I'd be able to just do $el.on('swipe', function(e){ console.log(e); });
[10:28:00] <BillCriswell> But you need to do $el.hammer().on('swipe', .. );
[10:28:21] <duch_kazatel> :(
[10:28:23] <alwayslearning> I have a an AJAX JSONp request set up , but for some reason i keep getting an extra string added to my callback parameter and i don't know why: http://jsfiddle.net/7Heew/      The callback in the url request should simply be callback=jsonp, but instead its making a request like: callback=jsonp=jQuery19106556925822515041_
[10:28:37] <BillCriswell> One of them days.
[10:37:10] <shoky> alwayslearning:  http://jsfiddle.net/7Heew/1/
[10:40:44] <alwayslearning> thanks @shoky. It's good now but out of curiosity any idea why _:1398706737524 gets added as a parameter to the querystring ?
[10:42:19] <funkt> Hi there I am trying to find a way I can remove parts using jquery on window width sizes - For example I have colorbox gallery on desktop site but would love to remove this on mobile (window size) but I cannot seem to put my finger on it or find what I am looking for would anyone here have any ideas?
[10:42:29] <shoky> alwayslearning: jquery adds that by default for jsonp, so it won't get cached
[10:42:53] <shoky> alwayslearning: if for some reason you don't want it there you can set  cache:true
[10:43:10] <duch_kazatel> be careful with that caching because IE is STICKY with it.
[10:44:51] <tandroid> duch_kazatel, I'm kind of jumping in here, but I always get confused on when to cache variables and not.
[10:44:59] <tandroid> Do you know of any articles that explain that well
[10:57:19] <Jon47> tandroid: if you
[10:57:25] <Jon47> 'are ever going to make the query again
[10:57:28] <Jon47> it's better to cache it
[10:58:00] <tandroid> Jon47, Okay, that's kind of what I though
[10:58:03] <tandroid> *thought
[10:58:07] <tandroid> thanks!
[10:58:35] <Jon47> they're talking about request caching in ajax though
[11:00:39] <duch_kazatel> yeah not variable caching.
[11:03:00] <tandroid> Ah my bad.
[11:03:20] <tandroid> But it still made me wonder :)
[11:41:30] <funkt> Hi there I am trying to find a way I can remove parts using jquery on window width sizes - For example I have colorbox gallery on desktop site but would love to remove this on mobile (window size) but I cannot seem to put my finger on it or find what I am looking for would anyone here have any ideas?
[11:41:54] <duch_kazatel> funkt you want to use CSS media queries.
[11:42:04] <funkt> No
[11:42:07] <duch_kazatel> uh, why not?
[11:42:08] <funkt> I don't think I can
[11:42:24] <funkt> I mean I have a lightbox which pops out on full screen
[11:42:33] <funkt> I need to remove that class on mobile width
[11:42:47] <funkt> and I was thinking I could do it through jquery maybe?
[11:43:04] <duch_kazatel> ah you don't want to bind the handler when the screen is below a certain size?
[11:43:09] <funkt> But I cannot find anything through searching and searching
[11:43:24] <funkt> sorry what do you mean? lol
[11:43:44] <funkt> bind the handler sounds good - what would that involve?
[11:43:55] <duch_kazatel> do you want to prevent the thing from opening on mobile?
[11:43:59] <funkt> yes!
[11:44:02] <funkt> thats it!
[11:44:08] <duch_kazatel> do you want to hide the link entirely on mobile?
[11:44:18] <duch_kazatel> how does this gallery launch?
[11:44:23] <funkt> erm...
[11:44:33] <funkt> yes!
[11:44:34] <duch_kazatel> or lightbox or whatever.
[11:44:47] <funkt> hiding the link entirely on a width below say 700px
[11:44:52] <funkt> perfect
[11:44:54] <duch_kazatel> then use CSS.
[11:44:57] <funkt> hmm
[11:45:01] <funkt> lol
[11:45:13] <duch_kazatel> you want a media query to set display: none; on that link when the screen is below that size.
[11:45:19] <funkt> How do I do that with a lightbox class automated on a link
[11:45:25] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:45:39] <funkt> ok I have a CMS {wordpress}
[11:45:59] <funkt> all the links for nng gallery  have a class added to them called .colorbox for example
[11:46:13] <duch_kazatel> those are the links that launch the modal?
[11:46:33] <funkt> sorry you lost me again
[11:46:47] <funkt> modal - I dont know what that is?
[11:46:53] <duch_kazatel> "lightbox"
[11:47:48] <funkt> <a href="#" width="125" height="100" class="mycolorbox"> </a>
[11:47:55] <duch_kazatel> you have a bunch of links that launch your lightbox - these all share a class, right?
[11:48:01] <funkt> yes
[11:48:23] <funkt> so I was thinking I could remove the class on a certain width
[11:48:24] <duch_kazatel> right - so you use a css media query to set .mycolorbox{display:none;} when the screen is below 700px;
[11:48:34] <funkt> oh would that work?
[11:48:37] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[11:48:37] <funkt> lol
[11:48:43] <funkt> oh lol whoops
[11:48:43] <duch_kazatel> why wouldn't it?
[11:48:46] <funkt> cheers!
[11:48:52] <funkt> I don't know really
[11:49:02] <brunoais> I see everyone yellow
[11:49:07] <funkt> I guess I had not thought of that
[11:49:08] <brunoais> it's a string insight....
[11:49:14] <ragas> this is ugly, but i could figure out the pretty way to do it: jQuery(this).find("header").children("h1").children("a").attr("title");
[11:49:33] <brunoais> ragas, do you know the direct child selector?
[11:49:40] <duch_kazatel> just use .find
[11:49:55] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, he's already using .find
[11:50:00] <duch_kazatel> $(this).find('header h1 a').attr('title');
[11:50:02] <ragas> this.header.h1.a.title is what im trying to access
[11:50:06] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, NO!!!!
[11:50:11] <duch_kazatel> brunoais wat
[11:50:12] <brunoais> that's wnot equivalent
[11:50:21] <duch_kazatel> so?
[11:50:24] <ragas> i tried that, duch_kazatel
[11:50:28] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[11:50:29] <brunoais> $(this).find('header>h1>a').attr('title');
[11:50:30] <brunoais> that is
[11:50:32] <duch_kazatel> i'm going on lunch.
[11:50:40] <brunoais> I think jQ also accepts with spaces
[11:50:44] <ragas> > ? ok..
[11:50:49] <brunoais> $(this).find('header > h1 > a').attr('title');
[11:50:50] <ragas> spaces didnt work
[11:50:54] <brunoais> ragas, you know CSS, right?
[11:50:58] <duch_away> he's talking about the selector syntax.
[11:51:02] <duch_away> in the future, sharing code is neat.
[11:51:28] <brunoais> that's one of the most simple selectors CSS has
[11:51:38] <brunoais> it's even in CSS2 spec (I think the CSS1 also had it)
[11:52:04] <mousemke> what gets overwritten to give $('.aClass') the same behavior as $('.aClass').get()?
[11:52:36] <brunoais> I dunno what .get() is
[11:52:38] <brunoais> :S
[11:52:52] <brunoais> Oh
[11:53:09] <brunoais> is it to get an element from the pseudo-array of elements?
[11:53:34] <BillCriswell> mousemke: Not sure I'm following.
[11:53:35] <ragas> thanks, brunoais!
[11:54:44] <brunoais> mousemke, use $('.aClass')[0]
[11:55:45] <mousemke> we're building our own framework actually, with .get() it returns the result, but without it it returns the function
[11:56:19] <brunoais> mousemke, a framework that works with jQuery?
[11:56:28] <brunoais> don't change jQuery
[11:56:30] <brunoais> just don't
[11:56:35] <brunoais> terrible idea
[11:56:40] <mousemke> not the idea
[11:56:52] <mousemke> this is from scratch, but only with a few thing we need
[11:57:37] <brunoais> mousemke, are you sure on what you want?
[11:57:50] <brunoais> you don't seem to have a good idea on what actually you want
[11:58:09] <mousemke> the action would be similar to $('aThing') but that function by itself just returns the code
[11:58:29] <BillCriswell> mousemke: It sounds like you just want sizzle then
[11:58:37] <BillCriswell> mousemke: http://sizzlejs.com/
[11:58:46] <mousemke> thanks!
[11:58:51] <BillCriswell> It's what jQuery uses to select the elements.
[11:58:57] <brunoais> mousemke, you probably won't need sizzle
[11:59:04] <brunoais> that depends on the browsers you want to support
[11:59:13] <brunoais> sizzle is very slow, so use it wizely
[11:59:14] <BillCriswell> Could probably get away with querySelectorAll
[11:59:20] <brunoais> my idea too
[11:59:51] <mousemke> i am using query all.  the setup works beautifully, but it's just missing something
[12:00:07] <brunoais> mousemke, what's missing?
[12:00:16] <mousemke> almost like rewriting valueOf or toString
[12:00:24] <BillCriswell> I wish anything worked beautifully enough for me to say beautifully today. Touch events can blow me.
[12:00:32] <mousemke> we have all the power written but just don't know where to put it
[12:01:00] <brunoais> mousemke, eh... what?
[12:01:08] <mousemke> (different symbol, but for comparison)
[12:01:14] <mousemke> $ returns the code
[12:01:28] <mousemke> $('athing') returns code
[12:01:34] <brunoais> $ == jQuery
[12:01:38] <mousemke> $('aching').get() returns the value
[12:01:42] <brunoais> mousemke, you mean in jQuery?
[12:02:04] <BillCriswell> The value of an element which would be what assuming it's not an input?
[12:03:11] <mousemke> no.  i mean maybe the method that it overwrites on a basic level to return $(athing) as a value instead of the code after all the other methods are attached to it
[12:03:40] <BillCriswell> I swear I don't understand what the hell anyone is saying anymore.
[12:03:41] <brunoais> mousemke, what code?
[12:03:46] <mousemke> it returns code of the to level function, not the array-like object, although it exists
[12:03:52] <brunoais> it returns a pointer to a jQuery object
[12:04:49] <brunoais> mousemke, how much do you know about jQuery? How about the DOM?
[12:05:20] <mousemke> between a lot and not all?
[12:05:35] <Voyage> Hi, I have a little slow / long page that also shows garbage/non-well structured html html elements while it loads. then at the end those html elements get aligned or some get hidden. But this leaves an ugly page loading. Is it a good idea to show "loading" or some picture on blank page until it is fully loaded.? if yes, how in jQuery?
[12:05:48] <brunoais> mousemke, that didn't help
[12:06:13] <brunoais> Voyage, no, no
[12:06:15] <mousemke> yeah...  i'm gonna keep digging and come back in a bit
[12:06:24] <brunoais> the HTML itself should come neatly from the server
[12:06:26] <Voyage> brunoais,  ?
[12:06:30] <brunoais> why don't you just do that?
[12:06:48] <brunoais> HTML + CSS to a presentational look
[12:06:49] <Voyage> brunoais,  the html is neat but for e.g I make some menu.hide() at start, the load badly
[12:07:03] <brunoais> Voyage, why not apply some useful CSS instead?
[12:07:27] <Voyage> I already have, but while its loading, its visible. at load end, it gets hidden
[12:07:50] <brunoais> As a last resource, you could make an inline style (applied to a class) and then place those classes to the elements where it applies on load
[12:07:55] <BillCriswell> Voyage: I'd just show a spinner then when the document is ready hide it.
[12:07:55] <brunoais> do not show an empty page
[12:08:02] <brunoais> do not slow a page with full clutter
[12:08:09] <Voyage> BillCriswell,  hm. how?
[12:08:13] <decx> modernizr & no-js css
[12:08:18] <brunoais> Bah
[12:08:21] <brunoais> I hate those
[12:08:24] <brunoais> They ruin my time
[12:08:39] <brunoais> I prefer to see the page building itself
[12:08:44] <BillCriswell> If someone isn't using js they don't deserve the internet.
[12:08:57] <brunoais> BillCriswell, that's too wrong
[12:09:04] <brunoais> see twitter, for example
[12:09:10] <Voyage> BillCriswell,  hm. how to show spinner until page loads?
[12:09:13] <brunoais> they started as a website full of js
[12:09:14] <BillCriswell> Voyage: Create the element, add it to the body, show it over everything, then when the document is ready hide it.
[12:09:25] <Voyage> hm
[12:09:38] <brunoais> now they went back to progressive enhancement
[12:09:48] <decx> how do you add something when the document isnt ready
[12:10:04] <brunoais> Voyage, or you could go with what I told with the class that tells everything to hide
[12:10:09] <decx> with jq*
[12:10:13] <brunoais> now choose the one that applies best for the website
[12:10:35] <BillCriswell> decx: I have no idea.
[12:10:40] <brunoais> BillCriswell, if that's the way to go, why create an element at all?
[12:10:54] <brunoais> why not just placing it in the DOM directly from the server?
[12:11:28] <brunoais> Voyage, KISS (Keep It Simple)
[12:11:31] <pthreat>    $(".upload").click(function(){       $("._file").trigger("click");    }); Works great on a desktop web browser but fails to run on my smartphone for some reason
[12:11:33] <brunoais> HTML + CSS for starters
[12:11:35] <BillCriswell> brunoais: .container { display: none; } document ready display block it. Put the loading thing on the body lol
[12:11:37] <brunoais> js to make it dynamic ;)
[12:12:22] <brunoais> pthreat, any errors in the console of the mobile browser?
[12:12:41] <Voyage> brunoais, k
[12:13:01] <brunoais> Voyage, avoid using the .css() function
[12:13:13] <brunoais> use addClass and removeClass (or toggleClass) instead
[12:13:29] <pthreat> Good question ...  how do I pop out the console in the smartphone browser
[12:13:37] <brunoais> leave the .css() for stuff that is impossible to predict in advance
[12:13:55] <brunoais> pthreat, that depends on the browser. Search the interwebz ;)
[12:14:01] <decx> i've been using css extensively to get around adding -webkit- to transform on my markup game test and its performance surprised me
[12:14:26] <decx> css() that is
[12:14:27] <brunoais> decx, Don't rely that that works well
[12:14:46] <brunoais> classes are better because the browser itself is in control of that
[12:15:00] <brunoais> and it is easier to debug
[12:15:03] <brunoais> and test
[12:15:08] <decx> not argueing that, but the severe penalty to css() is a myth
[12:15:09] <brunoais> and modify, if required
[12:15:18] <brunoais> There's no severe penality
[12:15:18] <drej> .css() just does the same thing
[12:15:22] <drej> except it does it for you
[12:15:36] <drej> all youre doing is adding overhead of adding the styles with various prefixes to your dom
[12:15:37] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah dude don't you know anything.
[12:15:57] <decx> that's right i don't know everything
[12:16:04] <decx> wait what
[12:16:08] <brunoais> drej, not really
[12:16:12] <drej> not really what
[12:16:15] <brunoais> the browser still has to parse stuff
[12:16:15] <BillCriswell> decx: Why the hell not?
[12:16:30] <BillCriswell> Sounds like you're being lazy.
[12:16:33] <drej> yup
[12:16:45] <decx> BillCriswell seriously, i'm positively amazed how well that mark up crap turned out even on mobile
[12:16:51] <brunoais> with classes the CSS itself is ready to use and preparesed
[12:16:55] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Sg77m/show
[12:16:57] <drej> all im getting at is that he's not saving anything except not having to write the prefixes, hes' just using .css to do it for him, which adds a little bit of overhead
[12:17:01] <drej> .css()
[12:17:06] <drej> because it has to happen after the dom is ready
[12:17:07] <brunoais> you can affect loads of elements with just 1 class
[12:17:17] <brunoais> with .css() you are limited to 1.
[12:17:44] <brunoais> drej, "because it has to happen after the dom is ready" <- Wrong. DOMContentLoaded is not required before making changes
[12:17:49] <BillCriswell> decx: Niiiice.
[12:17:56] <BillCriswell> I'm simply too good at video games to play them.
[12:18:07] <drej> brunoais does it have ot wait for jquery to load and init?
[12:18:19] <drej> i dont understand what your argument is
[12:18:38] <brunoais> decx, the animation is soooo slooowwww
[12:18:41] <drej> that its somehow more efficient to use javascript to apply css styles to elements rather than css documents?
[12:18:43] <brunoais> are you using js to animate?
[12:18:58] <decx> it's actually buttersmooth here
[12:19:03] <brunoais> drej, it's better to leave CSS to do it's job
[12:19:06] <decx> was just a test for a game with markup
[12:19:16] <drej> brunoais no shit?
[12:19:25] <drej> its exactly what i said from the beginning
[12:19:27] <BillCriswell> You have to check your megabits.
[12:19:28] <brunoais> HTML, CSS and javascript are cumplices in the job
[12:19:30] <drej> anyway
[12:19:43] <brunoais> when you move all to js, you are just screwing yourself
[12:19:46] <BillCriswell> If you don't check your megabits you're in trouble.
[12:19:47] <decx> 60x4 css() / second
[12:19:50] <drej> mocing on
[12:19:51] <drej> moving*
[12:20:00] <drej> BillCriswell did you tweak your P-RAM
[12:20:14] <BillCriswell> Of course.
[12:20:29] <BillCriswell> PSU is running at a solid 9
[12:20:38] <drej> nice!
[12:20:47] <drej> BillCriswell wanna see my favourite selector of the day?
[12:20:52] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[12:21:07] <drej> button:not(:disabled) ~ div { }
[12:21:09] <BillCriswell> Honestly, that would be the highlight of my day. Becuase today is terrible.
[12:21:22] <brunoais> drej, interesting....
[12:21:24] * drej hugs BillCriswell 
[12:21:45] * Brycetron yo
[12:21:45] <pthreat> https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging
[12:21:50] <pthreat> You have to be fucking kidding me
[12:21:55] <drej> pthreat ?
[12:21:57] <BillCriswell> drej: Is that for like the same thing as highlighting a label when a check box is checked?
[12:22:15] <pthreat> I need to enable remote debugging in order to debug javascript on android?
[12:22:18] <brunoais> BillCriswell, does not seem like it
[12:22:25] <drej> sort of, i have some angularjs loading a page, and i have status of the load in a div, angular enables the 'continue' button when everything is done loading
[12:22:28] <brunoais> enabling and disabling dynamically can only be made using js
[12:22:31] <drej> so i jsut hide the status bars when its finished loading
[12:22:39] <brunoais> Oh
[12:22:51] <brunoais> I still think AngularJS is questionable
[12:22:52] <BillCriswell> drej: Got it.
[12:23:16] <brunoais> it requires the server to send broken DOM to the browser
[12:23:35] <pthreat> You have to enable remote debugging or use USB in order to debug javascript on android xD
[12:23:55] <brunoais> nice
[12:23:56] <pthreat> Best google prank so far
[12:24:03] * brunoais clap clap clap
[12:24:05] <pthreat> fuckers
[12:24:14] <BillCriswell> pthreat: That's the same with debugging mobile safari... You need a mac and USB.
[12:24:14] <pthreat> I'm hating google even more lately
[12:24:23] <pthreat> jesus christ
[12:24:31] <decx> yeah i'll just stick to chromes emulation
[12:24:43] <BillCriswell> I don't believe Windows Safari has the ability to do it... I could be wrong, though.
[12:24:49] <pthreat> That's what happens when you put fucking nerd assholes to do productive work
[12:25:20] <pthreat> Google Plus NEW FEATURE! Now you can use VI KEYS. WOW! Good work! Everyone will use them
[12:25:21] <BillCriswell> pthreat: Sheesh.
[12:25:34] <pthreat> Sure, my mom will totally go for jk
[12:26:24] <snover> there hasn’t been a windows version of safari for years
[12:26:25] <pthreat> decx: me too but there's a problem I can't detect with chrome emulation
[12:26:49] <BillCriswell> Chrome's touch emulation has been misleading me a lot lately.
[12:27:36] <brunoais> The touch is usually 1st the touch events and then the mouse down and up then the click event
[12:28:16] <pthreat> BillCriswell: I've been developing with crome emulation however I find it FAR from accurate. I literally have my phone sitting in front of me, I've set chrome to emulate my very same phone, I see different things in both
[12:29:07] <BillCriswell> pthreat: Yeah, it's mostly the touch events that are a little funny to me.
[12:29:33] <pthreat> For me, I see different things on the phone and in the PC
[12:30:52] <decx> they joys of progressive enhancement: "oh 50 bugs and edgecases in js behaviour on mobile? - eh, fuck it. the site still works"
[12:31:52] <brunoais> decx, I never got issues with what I make
[12:32:07] <brunoais> I've been using progressive enhancement for 6 years
[12:32:09] <pthreat> You know I'm getting angry when console.log starts to get aggressive
[12:32:31] <decx> or when it mysteriously doesn't log
[12:32:32] <pthreat> console.log("FUCKERS");
[12:32:35] <pthreat> haha
[12:32:48] <brunoais> pthreat, is that for real?
[12:33:03] <pthreat> brunoais: Yeah I get angry and type all types of insults
[12:33:26] <pthreat> or something that would make me laugh so I don't have to kill anyone such as console.log("donkey boner");
[12:35:13] <pthreat> brunoais: I'm assuming you don't get angry when stuff like I'm going through happens to you?
[12:35:42] <pthreat> adb logcat browser:V *:S h4x0r
[12:35:46] <brunoais> pthreat, maybe I'm already prepared for it
[12:35:59] <pthreat> haha yeah ...
[12:36:06] <brunoais> I don't remember getting really angry with native API's
[12:36:11] <Ownix> Can someone help me understand wht removeData() does not seem to work? http://jsfiddle.net/A6YQ4/
[12:36:13] <brunoais> they are quite simple and usually work
[12:36:14] <pthreat> I lose my edge really quick
[12:36:33] <brunoais> pthreat, I only get like that with high level API's like primefaces
[12:36:52] <brunoais> I'm completely p***ed that I have to use it
[12:36:56] <brunoais> while it is kinda broken
[12:36:58] <pthreat> I got it working, but I still think it's bs
[12:37:22] <pthreat> brunoais: haha yeah I guess we all lose it with something
[12:37:37] <brunoais> why can't I just use jsp, ffs!
[12:37:43] <brunoais> It's much simpler and easier to use
[12:38:05] <brunoais> Ownix, removeData() is deprecated
[12:38:15] <brunoais> oh wait
[12:38:16] <brunoais> nvm
[12:38:17] <Ownix> brunoais: what can I use instead?
[12:38:18] <decx> it's getting the attribute
[12:38:19] <Ownix> oh
[12:38:25] <brunoais> it's a jQuery method, not DOM method
[12:38:29] <decx> Ownix http://jsfiddle.net/decx/A6YQ4/1/
[12:39:20] <pthreat> brunoais: No errors dud
[12:39:21] <pthreat> dude*
[12:39:31] <pthreat> crap ....
[12:39:34] <brunoais> pthreat, which part is failing?
[12:39:42] <brunoais> Is there a click event being fired?
[12:39:47] <pthreat> yeah
[12:39:54] <brunoais> have you checked?
[12:40:08] <pthreat> Works at chrome in my desktop
[12:40:13] <pthreat>  $(".upload").click(function(){       $("._file").trigger("click");    });
[12:40:23] <brunoais> I'm asking if there's a click event being fired in the mobile
[12:40:54] <brunoais> the element with the class upload is having an event listener attached for the "click" event
[12:40:56] <pthreat> let me add some more code
[12:41:01] <brunoais> is there a click event in the mobile code?
[12:41:09] <brunoais> pthreat, jsfiddle it pls
[12:41:13] <pthreat> yeah sure
[12:41:16] <pthreat> it's pretty simple
[12:43:57] <pthreat> brunoais: http://jsfiddle.net/79q6H/ there
[12:44:06] <pthreat> Not something complex at all
[12:44:32] <pthreat> Just adding some style to the upload button instead of having the ugly-regular-file-input
[12:44:59] <brunoais> pthreat, tip: use the HTML's hidden attribute ;)
[12:45:40] <brunoais> pthreat, do NOT trust fileNode.value
[12:45:50] <brunoais> different browsers will do it differentely
[12:46:05] <brunoais> I think jQuery does not normalize this (please someone correct if I'm wrong)
[12:46:38] <pthreat> Oh yeah it's just for adding style I don't trust that at all
[12:46:59] <pthreat> In windows 8 for instance it will say c:\fakepath\whatever
[12:47:08] <pthreat> adds literally fakepath
[12:47:15] <pthreat> But I don't trust that so dont worry
[12:47:26] <brunoais> pthreat, use the files attribute
[12:47:28] <pthreat> It's just for showing the use rthat the file is ready to load
[12:47:40] <pthreat> brunoais: which one again?
[12:47:55] <brunoais> fileElement.files
[12:48:04] <brunoais> it returns a list of files
[12:48:10] <brunoais> you can work with that
[12:48:39] <brunoais> $(".upload").val(fileName);
[12:48:39] <PhaseCode> Can anyone figure out why Hello World still pops up after the class is removed? @ http://jsfiddle.net/m2P26/
[12:48:45] <brunoais> will do fine ;)
[12:49:18] <brunoais> pthreat, I think the code is breaking on mobile when you try to get the value of an input@file
[12:49:23] <brunoais> try removing that part of the code
[12:49:26] <pthreat> lets try
[12:49:31] <pthreat> good idea
[12:50:07] <duch_kazatel> PhaseCode because the binding has all ready occurred to that node. you'd have to manually remove the binding or use event delegation.
[12:50:11] <brunoais> PhaseCode, the border for both is the same
[12:50:48] <brunoais> Oh wait
[12:51:03] <brunoais> yeah, what duch_kazatel said. Sorry I misread
[12:51:15] <PhaseCode> duch_kazatel: Okay, I did http://jsfiddle.net/m2P26/2/
[12:51:24] <brunoais> PhaseCode, it works on a static node list
[12:51:31] <brunoais> jQuery works always on a static node list
[12:51:34] <brunoais> not a live node list
[12:51:49] <PhaseCode> Which stops the Hello World, but when I create a new element, do I have rewrite on click handler for the new element?
[12:52:05] <duch_kazatel> you need to use event delegation instead.
[12:52:18] <duch_kazatel> is there a static parent element these are all getting put into?
[12:52:24] <PhaseCode> Yes
[12:52:25] <brunoais> PhaseCode, better use event bubbling characteristics than doing that
[12:52:30] <brunoais> trust me on that
[12:52:36] <duch_kazatel> what's the ID/class on that parent?
[12:52:38] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, answer is better
[12:52:39] <PhaseCode> brunoais: Can I get an example?
[12:52:46] <PhaseCode> Let me write up the demo duch_kazatel
[12:52:49] <brunoais> PhaseCode, see the manual about the on() method
[12:52:52] <brunoais> there's examples there
[12:53:11] <duch_kazatel> $('parent').on('click', '.active', function(){});
[12:53:16] <duch_kazatel> where parent is the id/class of that container.
[12:53:31] <pthreat> $("._file").click(function(){alert("Yeah I'm clicked"});
[12:53:46] <pthreat> It even shows the alert brunoais but it doesn't displays the damn box hah
[12:54:05] <PhaseCode> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/m2P26/3/
[12:54:36] <danz> Hey there!  Can someone help me with trying to get a jQuery pop up confirmation box UI element from requiring a response before going to the code behind?
[12:54:37] <duch_kazatel> PhaseCode are you meanind to append to .parent?
[12:54:43] <PhaseCode> YES!
[12:54:45] <PhaseCode> http://jsfiddle.net/m2P26/4/ :)
[12:54:46] <PhaseCode> !!
[12:54:47] <PhaseCode> Perfect.
[12:54:51] <duch_kazatel> :)
[12:54:56] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[12:55:04] <PhaseCode> Thanks, duch_kazatel & brunoais!!
[12:55:07] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[12:55:10] <brunoais> yw
[12:55:19] <brunoais> pthreat, thamn
[12:55:27] <duch_kazatel> danz what specifically do you need to know?
[12:55:32] <pthreat> weird huh
[12:56:14] <danz> @dutch I have a jquery pop up that appears by calling a javascript function onchange of a selected dropdown element
[12:56:27] <brunoais> pthreat, try to remove everything from that event callback
[12:56:34] <BillCriswell> This day is never ending.
[12:56:35] <brunoais> then add vital piece by vital piece
[12:56:40] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell i hear that.
[12:56:43] <danz> However, the function returns a bool before a yes or no has been selected, calling the code behind anyway
[12:57:00] <pthreat> brunoais: that's what I did,, I only have     $(".upload").click(function(){       $("._file").trigger("click");    }); now, nothing else
[12:57:01] <duch_kazatel> danz use my full screenname without prepending/appending to it - my client will ping me.
[12:57:18] <brunoais> pthreat,
[12:57:24] <danz> OK thanks duch_kazatel - did that work?
[12:57:26] <brunoais> make sure that the click() method exists in the DOM
[12:57:33] <brunoais> ask javascript about it
[12:57:48] <duch_kazatel> danz perfect :) could you fiddle up the HTML and javascript side of things real quick?
[12:58:06] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell you have a good weekend?
[12:58:21] <danz> I can't share the HTML on my thing totally because I'm using a C#.net enviornment
[12:58:49] <danz> however duch_kazatel I can share some
[12:59:00] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I didn't do shit.
[12:59:00] <brunoais> danz, what does that stop you?
[12:59:02] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: You?
[12:59:08] <duch_kazatel> danz i know you are - the "codebehind" was the givaway.  an example would be helpful still.
[12:59:19] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell it was brutal.  a gig on saturday and then another on sunday.
[12:59:20] <brunoais> danz, just ask the browser for the HTML
[13:01:13] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Niiice.
[13:01:47] <brunoais> pthreat, is it in the DOM?
[13:01:52] <danz> <asp:DropDownList ID="ddAction" runat="server" AutoPostBack="True"                                  onselectedindexchanged="ddAction_SelectedIndexChanged" onchange="ddAction_ConfirmDelete(this);"> <asp:ListItem Text="Preview Draft Catalog..." Value="8" />                                 <asp:ListItem Text="Delete Draft" Value="5"></asp:ListItem>                                   </asp:DropDownList>
[13:01:57] <danz> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">     function ddAction_ConfirmDelete(ddAction) {         var selectedText = ddAction.options[ddAction.selectedIndex].text;         // TFS 3092 - DMZ - 04/11/14 - Make Delete Draft instead of just delete due to dropdown changes         if (selectedText == 'Delete Draft') {             /*             var rc = confirm('Are you sure you want to delete?')             if (rc) {                 
[13:02:00] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ danz
[13:02:00] <b-ot> danz: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:02:06] <duch_kazatel> don't paste in the channel please.
[13:02:12] <brunoais> danz, I said to ask ask the browser!
[13:02:23] * brunoais le sigh...
[13:02:25] <duch_kazatel> and copy the rendered markup from firebug/dev tools.
[13:03:12] <pthreat> brunoais: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6886605/shit.png
[13:03:15] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell yeah.  the gig on saturday was killer.  had a total blast.  i got the women bartending that night to dance on the bar and started playing behind my head at one point.  dropped a few jaws.  it was nice.
[13:03:19] <pthreat> brunoais: that's the phone debug
[13:03:45] <pthreat> So yeah the event is being triggered
[13:03:49] <BillCriswell> Good times. I really barely left my house.
[13:04:02] <pthreat> But the file selection box is not showing for some reason
[13:04:48] <brunoais> pthreat, do you know how to know if the method exists in the DOM?
[13:05:43] <pthreat> brunoais: Not really but the click event IS triggering
[13:05:48] <brunoais> pthreat, use this:
[13:05:48] <brunoais> http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/79q6H/1/
[13:06:43] <brunoais> pthreat, you have to distinguish between jQuery events and DOM events
[13:06:51] <brunoais> when you want to communicate with the DOM you need DOM events
[13:07:09] <brunoais> .trigger() does not necessarily fire a curresponding DOM event
[13:07:20] <duch_kazatel> "jquery events and DOM events" wut
[13:07:29] <duch_kazatel> aaaah you mean native vs non-native.
[13:07:30] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, welcome to jQuery
[13:07:35] <duch_kazatel> wat
[13:07:38] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, no
[13:07:40] <brunoais> that's different
[13:07:52] <brunoais> native events are events that are defined in the w3c spec
[13:07:56] <duch_kazatel> right.
[13:07:59] <brunoais> it's events like load and DOMContentLoaded
[13:08:05] <brunoais> you also have the custom events
[13:08:09] <brunoais> those are not native
[13:08:11] <duch_kazatel> right.
[13:08:16] <brunoais> and they live in the DOM
[13:08:26] <brunoais> then, in jQuery, you have the jQuery level events
[13:08:42] <brunoais> For those, the browser doesn't even know that they exist (or existed)
[13:08:56] <duch_kazatel> huh?  where did you get that from?
[13:09:04] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, read the source code ;)
[13:09:08] <brunoais> it's right there
[13:09:20] <brunoais> read the .trigger() method
[13:09:21] <pthreat> again, works in the pc but not in the smartphone
[13:09:29] <brunoais> pthreat, what does the alert() show?
[13:09:35] <pthreat> nothing
[13:09:43] <brunoais> pthreat, in both?
[13:09:54] <pthreat> In dsktop just triggers the box
[13:10:06] <BillCriswell> pthreat: What about .on('click touchend') ?
[13:10:23] <brunoais> pthreat, did you see my code?
[13:10:29] <pthreat> yep
[13:10:45] <brunoais> ups
[13:10:49] <brunoais> wrong event
[13:10:59] <pthreat> BillCriswell: The funny thing is that the click event IS being triggered, but I'm not presented with any file selection interface on my smartphone
[13:11:13] <brunoais> pthreat, http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/79q6H/3/
[13:11:19] <brunoais> try this one
[13:11:21] <brunoais> press the button
[13:11:29] <brunoais> an alert() should appear
[13:11:31] <BillCriswell> pthreat: What OS?
[13:11:52] <brunoais> pthreat, on chrome it should appear that it is native code
[13:11:58] <pthreat> Android I really don't know the version ...
[13:12:00] <pthreat> let me see
[13:12:05] <brunoais> on the mobile...
[13:12:16] <BillCriswell> pthreat: Does any other site allow you to select files from your device?
[13:13:05] <pthreat> The problem is not that it doesn't lets me, the problem is I want to style the upload input a bit because it sucks
[13:13:13] <pthreat> brunoais: nothing
[13:13:23] <brunoais> pthreat, nothing or no alert?
[13:13:34] <pthreat> nothing at all
[13:13:43] <brunoais> really?
[13:13:46] <pthreat> testing with alert("nothing");
[13:13:48] <brunoais> on that version 3 one?
[13:13:49] <pthreat> ya
[13:13:53] <pthreat> yep
[13:14:16] <pthreat> alert("nothing"); worked
[13:14:17] <pthreat> hah
[13:14:30] <brunoais> pthreat, http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/79q6H/4/
[13:14:32] <brunoais> v4
[13:14:38] <brunoais> this time I'm testing the input only
[13:15:21] <pthreat> brunoais: that one worked
[13:15:28] <brunoais> pthreat, what appeared?
[13:15:30] <pthreat> it's showing the function as native code, good deal
[13:15:36] <brunoais> that's good
[13:15:39] <pthreat> function click(){ [native code]}
[13:15:39] <brunoais> pthreat, on both?
[13:15:41] <pthreat> good
[13:15:46] <pthreat> let me see
[13:16:03] <pthreat> yeah both in desktop and mobile
[13:16:09] <pthreat> so ... do I use
[13:16:22] <pthreat> $("._file")[0].click();
[13:16:29] <pthreat> and that should do it ... I hope?
[13:17:00] <brunoais> try it
[13:17:06] <brunoais> I g2g for a while (about 1h)
[13:17:13] <brunoais> be back in a while
[13:17:19] <brunoais> I'll be able to help you a bit more if you need
[13:17:20] <duch_kazatel> pthreat that won't work.
[13:17:25] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, why?
[13:17:45] <pthreat> it doesn't
[13:17:55] <pthreat> duch_kazatel: you're right it doesn't works
[13:17:55] <pthreat> haha
[13:17:56] <duch_kazatel> accessing elements using array indexes gives you the DOM node, not the jquery object.
[13:17:56] <brunoais> then it's the phone that is blocking it, for some reason
[13:17:58] <duch_kazatel> welcome to jquery ;)
[13:18:05] <pthreat> LOL
[13:18:09] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, THAT'S THE POINT!!!
[13:18:15] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:18:16] <pthreat> so ... er
[13:18:18] <brunoais> that's why I used that
[13:18:23] <duch_kazatel> you can't run .click() unless it's a jquery object.
[13:18:59] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement.click
[13:19:02] <brunoais> welcome to the DOM
[13:19:15] <duch_kazatel> hah well i'll be.
[13:19:15] <brunoais> there's click() blur() and focus()
[13:19:30] <brunoais> for quite a while, tbh
[13:19:35] <brunoais> gotta go
[13:19:36] <brunoais> brb
[13:19:47] <duch_kazatel> i'm giving up for today.  this dude apparently hates me.
[13:19:53] <decx> whats happening here? why js for a button restyle
[13:20:09] <duch_kazatel> dunno but apparently i'm an idiot who doesn't know anything.
[13:20:17] <decx> so what's new then
[13:20:22] <duch_kazatel> D:
[13:20:26] <pthreat> decx: restyle of an input file
[13:20:29] <decx> jkluvu
[13:20:31] <decx> ^^
[13:20:33] <duch_kazatel> <3
[13:20:42] <pthreat> decx: I'll gladly do it through CSS if possible ....
[13:20:55] <pthreat> Last time I checked, it wasn't possible ...
[13:21:05] <decx> just wrap it in a label hide yo buttons and yo husbands and style the label with css
[13:21:06] <pthreat> Hey no need to fight
[13:21:13] <duch_kazatel> word.
[13:22:00] <duch_kazatel> does anybody else know anything about these "special jquery events" that apaprently exist outside the DOM?
[13:24:07] <decx> wat
[13:25:17] <pthreat> decx: it's not that simple I have to load one form or another if the file extension is of one type or another type
[13:25:19] <pthreat> heh
[13:25:25] <duch_kazatel> dude said  "you have to distinguish between jQuery events and DOM events" "when you want to communicate with the DOM you need DOM events" ".trigger() does not necessarily fire a curresponding DOM event"
[13:27:21] <decx> sounds like a misunderstanding of the dom based on the fact that native elements have their own set of functions
[13:27:51] <decx> you're so anal about wording sometimes, chill yo ^^
[13:28:25] <pthreat> So anyways ...
[13:28:34] <decx> why have different forms for filetypes?
[13:28:36] <duch_kazatel> no i'm really genuinely curious.  trying to understand what he was talking about.
[13:28:37] <decx> seems ridiculous
[13:28:48] <pthreat> decx: doesn't it
[13:29:24] <pthreat> The user has to load different data for different extensions
[13:29:36] <pthreat> the form changes
[13:29:49] <decx> oh you want to manipulate the data clientside
[13:30:13] <pthreat> No, the user uploads a file, I require different data depending on the file extensions
[13:30:28] <pthreat> extension*
[13:31:12] <decx> then i don't get it, the native behaviour of a file button is nice enough, do the rest serverside
[13:31:27] <pthreat> I need data from the user based on the file extension
[13:31:54] <pthreat> if it's one extension I need certain data, if it has another extension, I require other data
[13:31:57] <pthreat> and so on
[13:32:11] <pthreat> I can't guess that data even if I wanted to server side
[13:32:24] <decx> but that data is in the filename?!
[13:32:32] <pthreat> It isn't
[13:32:34] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah okay.  i get what he was saying now.
[13:33:56] <decx> well?
[13:34:21] <duch_kazatel> let me get up an example.
[13:36:13] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/x5L7R/3/
[13:36:17] <duch_kazatel> that's what he was talking about.
[13:39:33] <nhulea> hey is it possible to save an image from mobile safari to photo album on iphone ?
[13:40:16] <BillCriswell> Tap the image for like 2 seconds.
[13:40:23] <BillCriswell> Or hold or whatever.
[13:41:17] <pthreat> Mom is that you?
[13:41:39] <krambiorix> my ajax call returns a whole html page ... How can i remove all content from the page and add the returned html ?
[13:41:40] <nhulea> cause I am using canvastodataurl to create an image then I want to be able to save it to photoalbum ok BillCriswell I will try that I think it might be weird cause its canvas
[13:42:04] <BillCriswell> nhulea: Hmm.
[13:42:07] <decx> i just link to the base64 string support is good enough
[13:42:24] <BillCriswell> Yeah, don't see why not.
[13:42:26] <pthreat> it is
[13:42:45] <krambiorix> i tried with $(document).html(data.html);  but i get a jquery error : safeFrag = document.createDocumentFragment();
[13:42:49] <decx> it's nice and fast when to save screenshots you have canvas anyway
[13:43:07] <decx> whats up with that sentence
[13:43:09] <decx> yikes
[13:43:23] <decx> nice and fast to save screenshots, when you have canvas anyway :>
[13:43:51] <BillCriswell> I was wondering if you could do anything special with the "download" attribute but I guess not.
[13:43:55] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix is it possible for you to change the returned html?
[13:44:04] <decx> download attribute works nice nowadays
[13:44:06] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, could be, why?
[13:44:20] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix because what you're trying to do is slow and inefficient.
[13:44:24] <nhulea> yeah its weird when I link to it doesnt do anything I am not sure why http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/tVnx4/8/
[13:44:27] <nhulea> there is my code
[13:44:47] <decx> i use that too, to save base64 strings, nice filename and everything
[13:45:10] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, what i'm doing is , saving a new item on the page and my php saves it and returns the view... Is there another way to do it?
[13:45:13] <nhulea> http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/tVnx4/8/ if you pull it up in ios safari it it just crashes or doesnt do anything :(
[13:45:17] <pthreat> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EORH8Nx6FHU This is what I call a nice pit
[13:45:22] <krambiorix> *the modified view
[13:45:23] <nhulea> http://jsfiddle.net/m/abb/
[13:45:47] <nhulea> decx: yeah filesaver is really nice
[13:45:58] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix are you posting to a different URL?
[13:46:32] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, same domain
[13:47:18] <nhulea> decx: it works fine on a regular computer but then crashes out on mobile I wonder if my preload script is just too much for mobile safari to handle
[13:47:57] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix just have that page return only the stuff you need.
[13:47:58] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, how is it normally done?
[13:48:03] <krambiorix> ow
[13:48:53] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix depends - if you're posting to a different page in your app, just have that return the appropriate data.  if you're posting back to the current page, set a flag on the post to tell it to generate only the necessary bits.
[13:49:47] <hlvwrk> dumb question. how do you apply two properties in one call? self.$('.radioBtns').prop("checked": false, "disabled": true); isn't working
[13:49:48] <hlvwrk> >:/
[13:49:55] <hlvwrk> it's been one of those days
[13:50:00] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, okay thanks
[13:50:50] <hlvwrk> self.$('.radioBtns').prop("checked: false", "disabled: true"); ??
[13:50:51] <hlvwrk> maybe
[13:51:05] <hlvwrk> nawh
[13:51:08] <hlvwrk> thats not right
[13:51:09] <hlvwrk> :(
[13:51:31] <duch_kazatel> try .prop({"checked": false, "disabled": true})
[13:51:58] <hlvwrk> now i feel dumb
[13:52:04] <duch_kazatel> that work for you?
[13:52:07] <hlvwrk> sec.
[13:52:17] <hlvwrk> yeap
[13:52:28] <hlvwrk> thanks
[13:54:40] <nhulea> Is there a way on a pc to debug mobile safari probably not huh?
[13:54:51] <nhulea> cause my script keeps crashing safari
[13:55:52] <lericson_> nhulea: there is actually
[13:55:59] <lericson_> if you run os x
[13:56:09] <lericson_> not sure if safari on windows can do it, doubt it
[13:56:20] <nhulea> yeah I have pc I saw that web inspect through desktop
[14:03:39] <Voyage> hi
[14:03:50] <Voyage> is http://socket.io for java server side also?
[14:04:17] <duch_kazatel> java != javascript.
[14:04:26] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  socket.io is serverside
[14:04:34] <duch_kazatel> right.
[14:04:51] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  I mean what languages can I use for socket.io serverside?
[14:05:00] <duch_kazatel> javascript.
[14:05:07] <Voyage> javascript is client side langauge
[14:05:08] <nhulea> yeah thats node.js right ?
[14:05:11] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[14:05:12] <duch_kazatel> node.js
[14:05:17] <duch_kazatel> javascript is client and server now.
[14:05:28] <nhulea> try express.io
[14:05:34] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  so if I need to use socket.io on serverside, I HAVE to use node.js?
[14:05:48] <Voyage> nhulea,  why
[14:06:17] <nhulea> Voyage: http://express-io.org/ it will make your life al;ot easier
[14:06:35] <Voyage> k
[14:06:45] <duch_kazatel> Voyage if you want to use the official socket.io, you have to use node.js
[14:06:53] <Voyage> :(
[14:06:54] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, you will have to find a port of the server.
[14:07:01] <nhulea> but serioulsy its a combo framwork that has templating and soket and node all in one
[14:07:10] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  port of server? whats that?
[14:07:28] <duch_kazatel> a port where somebody took the code and made it work on whatever language you want.
[14:07:33] <nhulea> you hve to set app.js
[14:07:33] <linagee> does anyone know where I can get jqplot help? :-/
[14:07:46] <duch_kazatel> i'm sure somebody has tried porting socket.io to java
[14:07:53] <duch_kazatel> dunno why, but i'm sure it's out ther.e
[14:08:14] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  porting?
[14:08:36] <duch_kazatel> Voyage rewrote it in another language/for another platform.
[14:09:40] <linagee> trying to figure out how to get (labels?) for an axis instead of numbers
[14:09:58] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  oh so socket.io ports are available as good and as stable as node.js socket.io ?
[14:10:37] <duch_kazatel> Voyage i have no clue.
[14:10:48] <Voyage> ok
[14:16:51] <brunoais> "<duch_kazatel> dunno but apparently i'm an idiot who doesn't know anything." <- Since when?
[14:17:48] <duch_kazatel> i give up today
[14:18:04] <brunoais> "<duch_kazatel> dude said  "you have to distinguish [...] a curresponding DOM event"" <- Hum... sounds like I failed to explain correctly :S
[14:18:11] <duch_kazatel> no, i get what you meant.
[14:18:24] <duch_kazatel> i understood what you were laying down.
[14:18:26] <brunoais> decx, there's more into it than just set of attributes and methods ;)
[14:19:30] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, I can explain to you :)
[14:19:34] <brunoais> just ask away
[14:19:48] <brunoais> it's good to share knowledge ^^
[14:20:07] <duch_kazatel> dude really?
[14:20:11] <duch_kazatel> i all ready said i figured out what you mean.
[14:20:14] <duch_kazatel> thanks though.
[14:21:32] <brunoais> oyu are welcome
[14:21:43] <brunoais> I thought you hadn't understood :S
[14:22:17] <duch_kazatel> i'm in a pretty bad mood today and i took offense to your caps and the way you phrased a few things.
[14:22:19] <duch_kazatel> it's no big.
[14:22:40] <brunoais> Ah ok
[14:22:41] <brunoais> sorry
[14:22:47] <brunoais> I'm too effusive
[14:23:05] <brunoais> I write how I speak and I don't hold it in
[14:23:21] <duch_kazatel> you yell at people irl too?
[14:23:29] <duch_kazatel> over small, trivial things? ;)
[14:23:45] <brunoais> Sometimes, at the peek of excitement, yes
[14:23:48] <brunoais> weird but true
[14:24:07] <nhulea> is there a limit to how many images can be loaded in mobile safari?
[14:24:09] <thebope> duch_kazatel, I never want to see a comment calling yourself an idiot
[14:24:14] <thebope> I do that shit too, it's stupid, and it sucks
[14:24:24] <duch_kazatel> nah it's all good thebope.  just having a rough time of it lately.
[14:24:37] <thebope> Yea, I've been there for like the last eight months
[14:24:40] <thebope> slowly coming out
[14:24:44] <brunoais> I actaully forgot what I wrote in caps
[14:24:44] <thebope> I always take stuff out on myself
[14:24:51] <poolson>  any idea how this data is encoded? its returned from some ajax call
[14:24:52] <poolson> http://pastebin.com/DzvwZRz8
[14:24:54] <thebope> I couldn't scroll far enough up to see it brunoais
[14:25:04] <brunoais> Ok I found it
[14:25:12] <thebope> base64 poolson ?
[14:25:18] <poolson> nah i tried that
[14:25:19] <poolson> lol
[14:25:46] <thebope> yea theres barely any special characters
[14:25:47] <brunoais> poolson, base64 of base64?
[14:25:51] <thebope> but theres some really weird ones
[14:25:57] <thebope> like the O with the dot in the middle
[14:26:45] <thebope> poolson, my best guess is that it is a base 64 ina  different encoding than normal
[14:27:16] <thebope> it has uppercase and lowercase characters, numbers, and the O with the dot in it
[14:27:34] <thebope> that's 26 + 26 + 10 + 1 = 63
[14:27:40] <thebope> so I'm not sure what the last character is
[14:27:58] <PhaseCode> brunoais: One more quesiton, more CSS related @ http://jsfiddle.net/m2P26/7/ How would I stop it from going to a new line after the width is filled? I tried doing overflow:hidden;
[14:28:15] <thebope> and the ending being "xR243RXc=", indicates it ends in an off number of bits
[14:28:23] <thebope> because base64 is encoded with 6 bits per character
[14:28:27] <brunoais> text-wrap IIRC
[14:28:29] <brunoais> let me check
[14:29:20] <poolson> actually i just did base64 twice ... it seems to be perhaps on right track
[14:29:36] <thebope> thats pretty funny haha
[14:29:41] <poolson> lol
[14:30:03] <decx> PhaseCode white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden on your .parent
[14:30:07] <poolson> yah ill mess with it
[14:30:24] <brunoais> yeah, what decx said
[14:31:08] <PhaseCode> If I wanted to do scrolling via buttons, would this be on the right track?
[14:31:21] <PhaseCode> Ie, left and right
[14:31:22] <decx> but if you want to move your elements fluid you may want to wrap them and use parent as a viewport while you move your wrapper inside with translateX
[14:32:32] <PhaseCode> decx: Would I be able to get an example, or point me in the direction of using translateX?
[14:32:45] <PhaseCode> I haven't messed with CSS animations yet
[14:33:03] <decx> ok mom
[14:33:18] <brunoais> PhaseCode, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform
[14:38:23] <PhaseCode> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/m2P26/10/
[14:38:37] <PhaseCode> decx: .parent would move the whole thing, click the blue box :)
[14:40:04] <decx> you can also control scrollposition, but that's not as cool
[14:42:44] <PhaseCode> decx: Would I jsut want to transform move all the divs inside the parent?
[14:45:55] <decx> no
[14:46:19] <decx> PhaseCode http://jsfiddle.net/decx/m2P26/11/
[14:46:39] <PhaseCode> Now Thats fancy
[14:47:47] <decx> now you could check if position <= 0 and prevent going offscreen and other stuff easily
[14:48:06] <decx> without having to get the translateX first everything
[14:48:15] <nhulea> is there image limit in mobile safari?
[14:48:27] <decx> everytime*
[14:50:28] <melkor> I have a collection of <div>'s each with a <ul> in them. I get the divs by var divs = $("#div-container").find(".div-class"); But then I have an htmldivelement, and I cannot use find again.
[14:51:34] <brunoais> melkor, that's quite weird
[14:51:43] <brunoais> in that case, you can always re-wrap in jQuery
[14:51:54] <brunoais> *in any case
[14:52:14] <duch_kazatel> i'd figure out why that's happening imo.
[14:53:00] <runvnc> were the divs added dynamically
[14:53:45] <melkor> duch_kazatel: the reason I am getting an [object HTMLDivElement] instead of [object Object]
[14:53:48] <melkor> runvnc: yes.
[14:54:52] <runvnc> then just wrap it like $(resultdivel).find('.nextthing')
[15:02:15] <alwayslearning> hey guys I'm attempting to make an AJAX jsonp request http://jsfiddle.net/FdLLt/ but i'm receiveing an Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :  even though i receive a response and i can open it and see the data inside
[15:20:35] <alwayslearning> I'm attempting to make an AJAX jsonp request http://jsfiddle.net/FdLLt/ but i'm receiving an Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :  even though i receive a response and i can open it and see the data inside
[15:37:51] <thebope> alwayslearning, Thanks Obama!
[15:38:09] <duch_kazatel> lol
[15:38:31] <alwayslearning> lol, would vote for a fix
[15:39:23] <nhulea> #alwayslearning
[15:40:37] <krambiorix> when i remove a div , i want to remove also the hr just below it... How can i do that? http://jsfiddle.net/rrV2t/
[15:43:16] <thebope> krambiorix, is there a container element?
[15:43:44] <krambiorix> thebope, one for all the divs and hrs
[15:43:54] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/rrV2t/1/
[15:43:56] <decx> var mydiv = $('#mydiv'); mydiv.add(mydiv.next('hr')).remove()
[15:44:07] <duch_kazatel> or decx's solution.
[15:44:19] <thebope> way cleaner than anything I was going to come up with
[15:44:37] <thebope> Once grad school is done, I'm just going to read them there jQuery docs
[15:46:06] <alwayslearning> It seems that the JSONp data is not returning wrapped in the callback function even though i requested it as so http://jsfiddle.net/FdLLt/2/
[15:46:16] <krambiorix> decx, thanks!!
[15:50:40] <decx> looks like add is expensive and just 2 remove() is just a bit faster http://jsperf.com/add-remove-vs-2-remove
[15:57:18] <thebope> good night everyone
[16:01:44] <krambiorix> my jquery script is 350 KB, is that too much?
[16:07:30] <duch_kazatel> "No one uses jQuery"
[16:07:32] <duch_kazatel> lmao.
[16:08:15] <nhulea> so I need to optimize this preload script anythoughts ? http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/6PgMm/
[16:08:44] <nhulea> it basically fails on ios
[16:09:29] <duch_kazatel> holy shit
[16:09:53] <duch_kazatel> what all is that doing?
[16:10:41] <nhulea> it grabs 56 random images from imgur api and then converts them into base64 images thats about it haha
[16:11:24] <nhulea> but it only seems to work on a regular somputer
[16:11:27] <nhulea> computer
[16:11:33] <nhulea> no mobile not sure why
[16:11:46] <duch_kazatel> that slowed my computer way down.
[16:12:05] <nhulea> yeah I have to come up with a better way to do it I think
[16:12:09] <shwaiil> If we pass a fn to $() this works as an alias of $(document).ready () ?
[16:13:13] <duch_kazatel> $(function(){}); is basically the same, yes.
[16:14:11] <shwaiil> duch_kazatel ok. Since always ? Never did that myself and thought it was wrong
[16:14:15] <nhulea> I wonder if I am hitting some asset limit in mobile safari or something
[16:14:38] <duch_kazatel> shwaiil just about.
[16:14:50] <nhulea> or maybe js is just slowwer in mobile safari?
[16:15:28] <shwaiil> Duch_kazatel just about ? What do you mean. Always ?
[16:15:54] <duch_kazatel> for as long as I can remember.
[16:16:10] <shwaiil> Ok thanks!
[16:16:11] <nhulea> yep just crashed on my again
[16:16:23] <nhulea> mobile safari is so shitty
[16:16:28] <duch_kazatel> word
[16:18:40] <nhulea> I wonder what I could do to make the script work faster ?
[16:22:29] <nhulea> Maybe my loop could be faster if I didnt use $.each
[16:22:42] <HowardwLo> hi fellas! Whats the best way to ajax with django? I have seen a couple of ways to do it; with a full page request, with partial request…
[16:29:14] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo request only the fragment you need.
[16:29:49] <duch_kazatel> nhulea i'd start there maybe.
[16:30:20] <nhulea> duch_kazatel: with the loop ?
[16:30:38] <nhulea> I could do somehting for (){}
[16:30:48] <duch_kazatel> is it an array?
[16:30:56] <nhulea> yeah well it is
[16:31:14] <duch_kazatel> then do a simple for loop.
[16:31:16] <nhulea> the object actually has a size property and height and widht
[16:31:24] <duch_kazatel> wait what?
[16:31:26] <nhulea> see this is alot faster
[16:31:43] <nhulea> http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/6PgMm/1/
[16:32:01] <duch_kazatel> hah nice
[16:32:01] <nhulea> the apit returns an array of objects
[16:32:13] <duch_kazatel> ah, yeah okay.
[16:32:21] <nhulea> *api
[16:32:36] <nhulea> I am trying it now on my phone
[16:32:42] * nhulea crosses fingers
[16:33:32] <nhulea> duch_kazatel: have you ever tried that phonegap mobile debugger on jsfiddle I have never got it to work properly
[16:35:02] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:35:07] <duch_kazatel> i don't use phonegap :)
[16:35:18] <nhulea> oh maybe you have to use phonegap
[16:35:29] <nhulea> I thought it didnt matter it was for everything
[16:40:02] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:46:11] <nhulea> I thought you could debug regular jsfiddle code and wasnt dependent that it was phonegap code
[16:47:45] <duch_kazatel> what does phonegap have to do with anything?
[16:49:33] <nhulea> when you click the 3 lines in the menu of jsfiddle it give 2 urls the mobile url and the debugger and it has a header that says experimental in all caps service provided by phonegap thats what I am refering too
[16:51:00] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah
[16:51:05] <duch_kazatel> that sucker.
[16:51:10] <nhulea> yeah
[16:51:33] <duch_kazatel> that's so you can debug code on your phone via your desktop.
[16:52:41] <nhulea> yeah I would liek to use it cause I am able to get the pictures to load now but they wont save is it possible to save a Canvas.toDataURL(); in mobile safari ?
[16:53:21] <duch_kazatel> !ciu Canvas.toDataURL()
[16:53:26] <duch_kazatel> !g caniuse Canvas.toDataURL()
[16:53:26] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Sorry, I can't find anything on Canvas.toDataURL()
[16:55:05] <BillCriswell> Silly robot.
[16:55:23] <duch_kazatel> tricks are for kids
[16:55:51] <duch_kazatel> trix jesus christ i haven had those in forever
[16:56:21] <BillCriswell> They... are probably terrible for you.
[16:56:27] <duch_kazatel> truth
[16:56:35] <nhulea> remember life that shit was pretty good
[16:57:00] <BillCriswell> I was a Cocoa Pebbles dude myself.
[16:57:08] <BillCriswell> Free chocolate milk at the end.
[16:57:27] <duch_kazatel> hahahhaa
[16:58:04] <duch_kazatel> i liked cheerios as a kid.
[16:58:18] <BillCriswell> Hone Nut or the regular boring ones?
[16:58:44] <nhulea> cracklin oatbran mofos !!
[16:59:10] <nhulea> that was da bomb
[16:59:16] <duch_kazatel> the regular boring ones.
[17:00:49] <BillCriswell> Not sure I've had oatbran.
[17:01:08] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Not sure I've ever eaten regulat, we had a honey nut household.
[17:01:36] <BillCriswell> I'm reading the documentation for the Kiosk software we use at work... it is less helpful than I ever imagined.
[17:01:39] <nhulea> http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91FhGV8Jf5L.jpg
[17:02:01] <nhulea> which kiosk is that
[17:02:20] <BillCriswell> http://www.kioware.com/ this... thing
[17:03:13] <nhulea> jesus
[17:03:31] <BillCriswell> I really wish a kiosk could just be a giant iPad.
[17:03:56] <acidjazz> were not far from that
[17:04:12] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: Looking forward to it.
[17:05:27] <decx> i have a sneak peek on the new iphone
[17:05:37] <decx> http://i.imgur.com/x60bfvc.jpg
[17:05:56] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[17:05:58] <acidjazz> lol
[17:06:36] <duch_kazatel> "and here we see an apple user in the native habitat"
[17:07:21] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: Do you do kiosk thingies?
[17:23:08] <tucan> i have a responsive site that uses Bootstrap's responsive tables but on regular portrait view on mobile phones, it cuts off my third column and user has to touch scroll side ways to see it
[17:23:40] * Velveeta flies into the room on Falcor, and jumps down the instant they touch the ground!
[17:23:49] <acidjazz> BillCriswell: i have in the past
[17:23:53] <tucan> does it make more sense to show/hide via a button or maybe make the table automantically scroll?
[17:23:59] <acidjazz> BillCriswell: mess w/ touchscreen a lot / etc.
[17:24:34] <tucan> or maybe just even just an arrow that tells the user  to use their finger on the table
[17:25:29] <Velveeta> tucan: a demo on jsfiddle or something would be helpful for us to see what you're trying to deal with
[17:27:17] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: Touch screens are driving me crazy recently. I think it's mostly the kiosk software that's complicating things.
[17:27:38] <duch_kazatel> that's always been a funny word to me.
[17:27:39] <acidjazz> are you using a browser
[17:27:40] <duch_kazatel> "kiosk"
[17:28:38] <tucan> Velveeta: it's not exactly a jsfiddle but my table looks something like this screenshot http://i0.wp.com/jasonbradley.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/bootstrap-responsive-tables-mobile.png
[17:29:06] <tucan> as you can see there is a horizontal scrollbar when on small mobile screens
[17:29:31] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: It's IE11, but the kiosk software seems to be doing something really odd with the touch screen events. Things will work fine in IE11 when it's running regularly but in the kiosk just no luck.
[17:29:36] <Velveeta> is that scrollbar not enough of a sign to the user that there's scrollable content?
[17:29:36] <tucan> and user is expected to know that touch scrolling will reveal the third and fourth columns
[17:29:49] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha. I just want "full screen that can't be fucked with"
[17:29:59] <acidjazz> BillCriswell: oh so the touch events route through this software to the browser
[17:30:11] <acidjazz> thats fucked
[17:30:20] <tucan> in fact, on the iphone, the user doesn't even see the scrollbar until they actually start finger swiping, it's silly
[17:30:33] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: I think that's what's happening. I want to test some more things with it tomorrow.
[17:30:47] <tucan> so they don't know the content is there
[17:31:50] <tucan> Velveeta: well no, depending on the size of the table, they wouldn't ever see the scrollbar
[17:31:55] <Velveeta> well, i suppose you could have some kind of indicator to the user that there's no content off-screen, and just show/hide it based on media breaks so it doesn't display on screens larger than some pixel count
[17:31:59] <tucan> since it's located toward the bottom
[17:33:01] <Velveeta> the other option would be to fix the table so it didn't scroll off the screen
[17:38:07] <tucan> hmm maybe ill post a jsfiddle
[17:40:04] <BillCriswell> tucan: Are you trying for responsive tables?
[17:42:33] <xqo> how can i make my 100% width/height body element not flow out of the page like this? http://jsfiddle.net/tCwJX/
[17:44:26] <BillCriswell> xqo: http://jsfiddle.net/tCwJX/1/ could work.
[17:44:39] <tucan> BillCriswell: yes i use table-responsive with bootstrap at the moment
[17:45:09] <tucan> this is what my table looks like http://jsfiddle.net/gQvX2/
[17:45:30] <tucan> i have about 35 rows for each table
[17:45:41] <BillCriswell> xqo: Could just do http://jsbin.com/viqot/1/edit?html,css,output as well.
[17:46:13] <tucan> due to the nature of the content, i am not sure if i should rearrange or cut off the third column (small screens)
[17:46:40] <xqo> BillCriswell http://jsfiddle.net/tCwJX/2/ is what i really want
[17:46:43] <BillCriswell> tucan: http://css-tricks.com/examples/ResponsiveTables/responsive.php maybe?
[17:46:46] <xqo> the background-colors was just for testing
[17:47:15] <tucan> BillCriswell: I've seen that but I don't think it would look good
[17:47:39] <tucan> though it is a possibility
[17:48:53] <tucan> I'm thinking maybe there is a jquery solution where a button makes the table scroll to the right
[17:49:05] <BillCriswell> xqo: http://jsbin.com/viqot/2/edit?css,output ?
[17:49:22] <BillCriswell> tucan: Still seems kind of gross.
[17:49:22] <tucan> but we're talking about a select few of iphone users
[17:49:35] <xqo> BillCriswell yeah, thanks!
[17:49:41] <tucan> with < 360px width
[17:49:57] <tucan> yea
[17:50:04] <tucan> it might be overkill
[17:50:08] <xqo> BillCriswell how come the body stretches 100%, when it is not specified?
[17:50:14] <xqo> err in width, i mean
[17:50:22] <tucan> just to satisfy 5% of users
[17:50:35] <tucan> to include this button hide/scroll thing
[17:50:47] <BillCriswell> xqo: That's what block level elements do.
[17:50:52] <xqo> BillCriswell ok thank you
[17:50:57] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[17:53:19] <BillCriswell> tucan: Here is a better styled responsive table: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.3.0-beta.1/docs/tables/table-reflow.html
[17:53:47] <tucan> one other possibility is that i merge col2 and col3
[17:54:00] <tucan> and make it colspan
[17:54:12] <BillCriswell> tucan: That can work.
[17:54:41] <BillCriswell> tucan: Sadly, the only way I can see wide tables working is with the responsive table approach.
[17:57:11] <tucan> i meant rowspan
[17:57:39] <tucan> gonna try and see how that looks
[17:57:41] <BillCriswell> tucan: I understood haha
[17:57:53] <tucan> im thinking it would look ugly
[18:03:02] <nhulea> yo !
[18:03:49] <BillCriswell> ayy
[18:04:51] <Velveeta> tucan: when trying to design for smaller interfaces, you need to really focus on what is the important content to the user... are all of those columns necessary for the user? and if so, could they just be combined into a single column or 2 with more of a tiled apperance?
[18:06:03] <tucan> http://jsfiddle.net/gQvX2/3/
[18:06:14] <tucan> with rowspan it looks kinda ugly
[18:07:21] <tucan> maybe with some better styling it could look decent
[18:11:45] <tucan> it's better than scrolling but its still a bit questionable
[18:14:38] <tucan> the thing is the third column pronunciation is very important
[18:19:14] <acidjazz> anyone here good with IE9.. im having an object expected nightmare
[18:27:05] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: If I had it around I'd look... can you share the code? Maybe it's something obvious.
[18:29:03] <acidjazz> BillCriswell: http://iwantdolbyatmos.dolby.com/
[18:29:38] <BillCriswell> Where is the error coming from?
[18:29:50] <coldhead> from the internet
[18:31:11] <BillCriswell> I hear there's a lot of errors on that internet.
[18:32:27] <acidjazz> BillCriswell: IE9.. survey wont work.. its a clusterfuck of 'object expected'
[18:33:05] <coldhead> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BN2kt2HCMAA0_Z4.jpg
[18:33:28] <acidjazz> lol
[18:33:34] <acidjazz> whered u get that coldhead
[18:33:49] <acidjazz> im feeling that right now w/ ie9
[18:34:26] <BillCriswell> coldhead: lol
[18:36:00] <coldhead> it's from https://twitter.com/marick/status/460953552760733697
[18:36:01] <b-ot> coldhead: @marick: For @colinmbullock http://t.co/SwbhSJinnp
[18:41:48] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: What happens if you take the type="text/javascript" off those script tags?
[18:42:39] <acidjazz> off?
[18:42:45] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[18:43:32] <acidjazz> BillCriswell: nothin, still a nightmare
[18:47:18] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: Ah, duh.
[18:47:58] <acidjazz> BillCriswell: found something?
[18:48:37] <BillCriswell> Just thinking.
[18:48:48] <BillCriswell> How about trying 1.11 over 2?
[18:48:58] <acidjazz> watcha mean
[18:49:00] <acidjazz> jquery?
[18:49:26] <BillCriswell> YEs
[18:49:36] <acidjazz> ok
[18:49:38] <acidjazz> lemme try
[18:50:18] <BillCriswell> and if that doesn't do it, how about .prop('disabled', true|false); over .attr('disabled', 'disabled') or whatever
[18:50:43] <acidjazz> hmm nope onthin
[18:50:50] <k_sze[work]> erm, why does $('input:checkbox:checked').val() only return the value of the first match?
[18:51:12] <acidjazz> BillCriswell: ill try that next
[18:51:31] <BillCriswell> k_sze[work]: That's just how jQuery works. You'd want to loop through them all if you want each.. Do you want them in an array?
[18:51:35] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: Sweet.
[18:51:47] <k_sze[work]> BillCriswell: yes, I I want them in an array.
[18:51:55] <k_sze[work]> I know how to loop, of course.
[18:52:02] <BillCriswell> k_sze[work]: Right, understood.
[18:52:09] <BillCriswell> You could use .map.
[18:52:21] <acidjazz> nope same errors same line
[18:52:26] <k_sze[work]> but it just seems strange that jQuery makes a special case out of multiple <select>, but not checkbox.
[18:52:28] <acidjazz> line 19 of survey.js
[18:52:33] <BillCriswell> var checked = $(':checked').map(function(){ return $(this).value(); }).get()
[18:54:16] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: I didn't know it was down to a line.
[18:54:49] <acidjazz> BillCriswell: god knows where the bug really is w/ ie9
[18:55:49] <BillCriswell> If you just comment out both of those lines does the script still give you an error?
[19:07:40] <nhulea> hey so is ie gone for good now ?
[19:08:10] <tw2113> no
[19:08:18] <tw2113> you still have IE9-11
[19:08:22] <nhulea> http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/internet-explorer-glitch-leaves-computers-vulnerable-hackers/story?id=23503657
[19:08:37] <nhulea> haha
[19:08:38] <tw2113> and 9-11 will be patched
[19:08:52] <nhulea> I dont think they should patch them
[19:09:05] <tw2113> say you have a product that a bug is discovered in
[19:09:05] <nhulea> haha
[19:09:12] <tw2113> would you just abandon the project?
[19:09:15] <tw2113> or would you patch your shit
[19:09:40] <nhulea> I just wonder if ie is really worth keeping alive
[19:09:46] <tw2113> to Microsoft, it is
[19:09:53] <nhulea> yeah I guess your righht
[19:09:53] <tw2113> it's their product, 20 years old or so
[19:10:10] <tw2113> still has a nice marketshare
[19:10:14] <nhulea> aging like a fine wine
[19:10:35] <tw2113> they're learning from past mistakes with newer versions
[19:11:46] <tw2113> they just need to get people off of XP now, which is a bigger thing than just a browser version
[19:11:49] <nhulea> erd your right'
[19:11:51] <nhulea> wrd
[19:11:55] <coldhead> they've got good people like jdalton fixing their shit

[19:17:41] <coldhead> yes
[19:17:51] <tw2113> nhulea, truth is, long time ago coldhead had a running joke start with him where it's always his first day
[19:17:52] <coldhead> well, i think of the other coldhead as the different coldhead
[19:17:56] <coldhead> i'm the regular coldhead
[19:18:01] * tw2113 spoilers
[19:18:06] <coldhead> that wasn't a joke, tw2113
[19:18:08] <coldhead> >: |
[19:18:24] <coldhead> i can't believe you'd say a thing like that about a girl with no legs
[19:18:26] * nhulea mind b lowing up!!
[19:18:51] <coldhead_nhulea> yeah thats better
[19:18:59] <tw2113> she has arms yet, she'll be fine
[19:19:14] <coldhead_nhulea> this is my first day here what is jquery ?
[19:19:23] <coldhead_nhulea> haha
[19:19:50] <coldhead> coldhead_nhulea: you remind me of a young me
[19:19:54] <coldhead> earlier today
[19:19:59] <coldhead_nhulea> haha
[19:20:25] <bnovc> I'm getting "undefined is not a function" when I call $.find('tr').show(). The stack just says "native code" - what are some possibilities on what I'm doing wrong?
[19:23:29] <coldhead> bnovc: you don't generally call $.find()
[19:23:40] <coldhead> you more likely want $('tr').show()
[19:23:49] <coldhead> or $('table').find('tr').show()
[19:23:52] <bnovc> coldhead: ya, I was just trying to provide a sample case
[19:24:02] <bnovc> I really do <stuff>.find()... but $.find('tr') reproduces it
[19:24:22] <coldhead> can you show us the <stuff> ?
[19:24:28] <coldhead> $.find() is a different thing
[19:24:45] <bnovc> shouldn't $.find('tr') == $('tr') ?
[19:24:48] <coldhead> no
[19:24:53] <bnovc> oh, how is it different?
[19:24:54] <coldhead> $.find() is sizzle
[19:25:03] <coldhead> $('something').find() is jQuery
[19:25:36] <coldhead> $.find is something jQuery uses internally
[19:27:41] <coldhead> anyway what's everyone wearing?
[19:27:44] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[19:29:00] <bnovc> coldhead: thanks - removing $.find fixed it
[19:29:26] <coldhead> hooray!
[19:29:34] <coldhead> let's all take a short break
[20:12:22] <coldhead_nhulea> and were back !
[20:13:26] <Kamuela> welcome back
[20:36:03] <oow> quit
[20:47:56] <Sharperte> I have ap roblem with my javascript using jquery. The idea is to read from a text file line by line and display inside the Latest News red box of demo3 the lines and make them scroll up. Instead each few seconds its adding another new Latest News red box with all the text content of the text file. And not scrolling up only 2 lines each time.
[20:47:58] <Sharperte> https://gist.github.com/Csharper1972/11390229
[20:48:25] <Sharperte> You can see it on my site: http://newsxpressmedia.com/test.html
[20:49:04] <Sharperte> Each some seconds a new red box with Latest News is adding like append with the whole text file content and its not scrolling.
[20:49:14] <Sharperte> Where is the problem with the code ?
[21:02:18] <zlio> hello #jquery
[21:03:12] <zlio> need some help..
[21:03:21] <zlio> given the following code: http://pastebin.com/8qd0wRH3
[21:04:19] <zlio> clicking the 'bumper' button really fast messes up the switching of UP and DOWN. is there a better way to secure this? the code works as expected but I just wanna know if there's a way to prevent a clickbot from messing it up.
[21:09:08] <coldhead_nhulea> preventdefault?
[21:11:39] <coldhead_nhulea> zlio: http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/h8B2U/
[21:17:16] <zlio> thanks coldhead_nhulea, but the problem persists.
[21:17:47] <zlio> i guess im just being picky; I also like the way you wrote to be neater though, learned that at least :)

[21:30:40] <coldhead> snover: i've learned to stop trying
[21:30:43] <coldhead> snover: <3
[21:30:50] <snover> coldhead: good job!
[21:31:01] <snover> i hope someday to learn that too.
[21:31:15] <coldhead> wait, i learned it from you!
[21:32:29] <snover> then you learned wrong!
[21:32:39] <coldhead> >: (
[21:32:53] <snover> i feel that way too!
[21:56:09] <il> how can I continuously update the text of one element with the (continuously changing) text of another element with jquery?
[22:01:17] <Dub_yuh_tee_eff_> emacs rage mod
[22:24:34] <Gorakhpuriya> Hi, would you please tell me ... How can I load a new page on click on left and right arrow????
[23:18:33] <zizzl> Hey guys I have a few animation lines like $('#div').animate({'height':'98'}, 1000); how can I make each one run after the next rather than all at the same time
[23:23:11] <Cork> zizzl: you need to bind the next one from the complete callback of the previous one if they arn't on the same element
[23:23:51] <Gorakhpuriya> When I use the load, it is not load the an other page and give me "ReferenceError: load is not defined"??
[23:32:56] <brunoais> Gorakhpuriya, how are you using that?
[23:33:01] <brunoais> can I get a small snippet?
[23:33:56] <Voyage> Hi
[23:34:07] <Voyage> can anyone help me out with this small loop? http://pastie.org/9121993
[23:35:30] <zizzl> Cork, thanks bud
[23:36:13] <Cork> Voyage: define help
[23:36:16] <Cork> zizzl: np
[23:36:50] <Voyage> Cork,  :) the help required is written on line 9 and 17
[23:36:51] <brunoais> Voyage, do not use appendNode() on selectboxes
[23:37:03] <brunoais> use the add() method in the DOM
[23:37:15] <Cork> brunoais: append works just fine
[23:37:26] <coldhead> Voyage: you need quotes around your value=""s
[23:37:27] <brunoais> Cork, I have to read jQuery again -_-
[23:37:28] <coldhead> http://pastie.org/9122058
[23:37:34] <coldhead> hej Cork
[23:37:42] <Cork> o/
[23:38:14] <Voyage> brunoais,  Cork  the .append("<option value="+date+">       should output  .append("<option value="2014-04-28 14:37:59.0">        and not <option value="2014-04-28"
[23:38:30] <Cork> Voyage: drr coldheads comment
[23:38:32] <Cork> *see
[23:38:39] <brunoais> Voyage, then it's as Cork said
[23:38:40] <coldhead> Dr. Coldhead
[23:38:49] <brunoais> use apostrophe's
[23:38:55] <Cork> sir. coldhead :)
[23:40:17] <coldhead> Princess Coldhead, pls
[23:40:26] <Cork> lol
[23:41:02] <Voyage> coldhead,  how do I escape ""
[23:41:09] <Cork> \"
[23:41:17] <Voyage> "<option value=""+date+"">"+date+"</option>"
[23:41:21] <Cork> no
[23:41:24] <Voyage> "<option value=\""+date+\"">"+date+"</option>"
[23:41:24] <Cork> \" not "
[23:41:43] <Voyage> ?^
[23:41:43] <Cork> or just use ' for js strings :)
[23:41:55] <Voyage> ya, but if not ', then?
[23:41:55] <Cork> the later is correct ya
[23:42:04] <Voyage> k
[23:43:30] <brunoais> voyage, you can also use "'"
[23:43:33] <brunoais> like so:
[23:43:43] <coldhead> \y\o\u\ \s\h\o\u\l\d\ \e\s\c\a\p\e\ \e\v\e\r\y\t\h\i\n\g\ \t\o\ \b\e\ \s\u\r\e
[23:43:46] <brunoais> "<option value='"+date+"'>"+date+"</option>"
[23:43:49] <Voyage> brunoais,  if i dont want  ' ?
[23:44:33] <Cork> Voyage: ' has the same meaning as " so why do you hate it so much?
[23:44:52] <brunoais> meh...
[23:44:57] <brunoais> I'll be back...
[23:44:58] <brunoais> g2g
[23:45:46] <coldhead> have the best time, brunoais
[23:45:48] <coldhead> seriously
[23:47:59] <Voyage> Cork,  i have solved it with ' but I come from java, and theres no ' for strings in java.
[23:48:10] <Voyage> Cork,  I just wanted to be consistant
[23:48:16] <Cork> Voyage: this isn't java ^^
[23:48:27] <Voyage> ya. itss not
[23:48:38] <Voyage> Cork,  so its not possible with \"?
[23:48:44] <Cork> it is possible
[23:50:51] <Voyage> Cork,  thanks
[23:59:58] <CaptainQuirk> Hi there !
