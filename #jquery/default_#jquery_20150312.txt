[00:41:50] <DragonPunch> i have 3 boxes in jquery which im trying to do the toggle function to. when i click one it minimizes all 3 and pops all 3 back up when clicked again. I don't want all 3 to be toggled when I click on one. I want the one I clicked on to be toggled. How do you make this work?
[00:42:18] <Cork> ?paste @ DragonPunch
[00:42:18] <b-ot> DragonPunch: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:46:05] <DragonPunch> Cork: my code is too much and its in jade. ill jsut try to figure it out.
[00:46:26] <BinaryKitten> DragonPunch - usuall issue is that you're toggling the wrong items
[00:46:55] <markholmes> ?live @ DragonPunch
[00:46:56] <DragonPunch> well i have the same class on all 3 divs and im saying toggle the guy with the class .pee and everyone has .pee
[00:47:00] <BinaryKitten> i'm guessing you're doing this in an click event handler, if so the element that was clicked will be in the "this"
[00:47:20] <markholmes> so do :nth-child(1) or whatever it corresponds to
[00:47:31] <BinaryKitten> or $(this)
[00:47:46] <BinaryKitten> as you've clicked it.
[00:47:47] <markholmes> ^ smarter solution
[00:48:35] <alea123> anyone can help me with this problem?: http://pastebin.com/jTuLsihY <-- this loads not every time i call.. sometimes it does on the first pageload, sometimes only after i refresh the page... data_id is everytime set
[00:48:47] <DragonPunch> i do this
[00:49:02] <DragonPunch> $this.next('.pee').toggle();
[00:49:07] <DragonPunch> and it works like a charms
[00:49:10] <Woet> alea123: "sometimes" is not useful, it's not random. check your console.
[00:49:22] <Cork> alea123: what is the network response from the server?
[00:49:49] <BinaryKitten> DragonPunch good. not sure why you'd do that but sure
[00:49:50] <Cork> alea123: also ready inside the body isn't reliable in older ie
[00:49:55] <Cork> so that might be another cause
[00:50:13] <DragonPunch> idc for ie users. they are not my crowd.
[00:50:42] <DragonPunch> im making this for myself anyways. as long as it works on my laptop wee : )
[00:50:58] <Cork> DragonPunch: that is an attitude that should be avoided
[00:51:13] <Cork> it is what got us into the ie6 mess back in the late 90's
[00:51:29] <Cork> older ie, sure but all ie; not grate
[00:53:28] <DragonPunch> Cork: as long as it works on my laptop and looks pretty. weee :)
[00:53:40] <vinex08> anyone from sydney here?
[00:53:53] <DragonPunch> Cork: i will only share my code/projects with my friends thats about it.
[00:54:07] <DragonPunch> Cork: i'm not into the whole open source thing yet
[00:54:57] <DragonPunch> and my friends dont use ie C:
[00:55:47] <BinaryKitten> which browser do you use DragonPunch?
[00:55:58] <DragonPunch> lynx
[00:56:19] <BinaryKitten> since when does jQuery run in lynx?
[00:56:24] <DragonPunch> im busy coding atm : ) ill ttyl if i have more questions.
[00:57:09] <Cork> <_<
[00:57:13] <BinaryKitten> DragonPunch -  so, jQuery, Pidgin and probably the browser too. <-- can you guess how much of that is Open Source?
[00:58:17] <BinaryKitten> also, good luck DragonPunch - you have a good day now
[00:58:34] <BinaryKitten> morning Cork
[00:58:47] <BinaryKitten> it must be early as i'm trying to autocomplete "morning"
[00:59:39] <Cork> :)
[01:00:09] <BinaryKitten> i have 15 slides done
[01:00:28] <BinaryKitten> it's a mess lolk
[01:01:10] <alea123> Cork: console says it loads, but it doesnt... and its rly sometimes.. i guess its something with the browser cache... maybe a timestamp would help
[01:03:10] <Cork> alea123: you can set cache: false to $.ajax
[01:03:14] <Cork> and it will do it automatically
[01:03:19] <Cork> and ya, try that
[01:16:50] <alea123> Cork: timestamp didnt help
[01:17:03] <alea123> will try with cache = false
[01:22:38] <Cork> alea123: cache: false adds a timestamp
[01:22:48] <Cork> so if it didn't work adding it manually that won't work either
[01:30:42] <Omar-> good morning!
[01:35:36] <alea123> Cork: cache : false didnt help too.. i dont get it...
[01:45:26] <Cork> alea123: it means cache isn't related to the problem
[01:45:35] <Cork> alea123: i would suggest looking at the server logs
[02:08:52] <Omar-> how can I let draggable widget support touch events?
[02:09:00] <Omar-> in other words, replace mouse with touch
[02:09:04] <Omar-> I
[02:09:12] <Omar-> I've downloaded draggable widget only
[02:29:21] <alea123> Cork: missed that point.. will look into logs
[02:29:28] <alea123> thank you
[02:30:11] <emx> is there a function that returns me the same value as .css( 'width' ) but without "px"?
[02:30:25] <Cork> .width()?
[02:31:41] <Omar-> element.style.left == offset().left? or position().left?
[02:31:53] <emx> Cork, .width() is affected by box-sizing and returns the same value as css( 'width' ) only in certain circumstances.
[02:32:16] <Cork> Omar-: neither
[02:32:32] <Cork> style.left is the left css property
[02:32:40] <Cork> and has nothing to do with either offset or position
[02:32:59] <Cork> emx: if you want the raw css value you would have to parse the css value
[02:33:34] <emx> Cork, i just figured. thanks.
[02:34:40] <imolorhe> Hi
[02:35:05] <Omar-> Cork thanks :)
[02:35:31] <imolorhe> I am working on a site where I need to render a large number of elements, traverse through them and make changes.
[02:36:05] <imolorhe> The approach I have followed is to create the DOM elements and make all the necessary modifications to it before appending it to the DOM
[02:36:37] <imolorhe> However, the site performane is still slow
[02:36:45] <imolorhe> Any help on this would be appreciated
[02:37:14] <Cork> imolorhe: are you appending the elements as you go or collect them and append them all in one batch?
[02:37:28] <imolorhe> I collect them all and append at once
[02:37:51] <imolorhe> The appending part of the script doesn't take so long but traversing through the elements before appending it takes a while
[02:37:56] <Cork> have you done an analysis of where the time is spent?
[02:37:58] <imolorhe> And it affects the UI
[02:38:26] <imolorhe> The UI practically freezes during the duration of the traversing
[02:38:40] <Cork> well it isn't precitally, it does
[02:38:50] <Cork> the page isn't allowed to update while js runs
[02:39:46] <imolorhe> Yeah..its a list of checkboxes..I go through them one by one and based on some factors, I set the checked property as true or false
[02:41:07] <imolorhe> Hello?
[02:46:36] <imolorhe> Cork: so profiling the page, it seems most of the time is taken by the jquery find() function which I use to get each of the checkboxes I traverse through
[02:47:03] <imolorhe> within that, the time is taken by the querySelectorAll() function
[02:47:11] <Cork> so most likely you're selector needs to be optimized
[02:47:23] <Cork> cause it takes too much time to run
[02:49:38] <imolorhe> Cork: but how am I supposed to optimise the performance of querySelectorAll() ?
[02:50:00] <Cork> you don't optimize the code you need to optimize the selector
[02:50:04] <Cork> as in the string you give .find
[02:51:13] <imolorhe> ok so this is the line that performs the find operation: $filters.filter('[data-id="' + curFilter.id + '"]').find('input[value="' + curOption.id + '"]')
[02:51:26] <Cork> [data-id="' + curFilter.id + '"] <-- for one
[02:51:39] <Cork> that is the second slowest selector you can write
[02:51:46] <imolorhe> Really?
[02:51:53] <imolorhe> So how would I rather write it?
[02:51:54] <DelphiWorld> how is Cork doing?
[02:51:55] <Cork> it has to loop every element
[02:52:01] <Cork> then loop every attribute for those elements
[02:52:05] <Cork> find if the name matches
[02:52:10] <Cork> then check if the string matches
[02:52:24] <Cork> imolorhe: add a class or an id attribute
[02:52:27] <Cork> and select on that
[02:52:46] <Cork> find('input[value="' + curOption.id + '"]') might be a problem for the same reason
[02:52:58] <Cork> but it depends on how many input elements it has to loop
[02:53:14] <Cork> DelphiWorld: just fine
[02:53:25] <DelphiWorld> Cork: gtc!
[02:53:29] <DelphiWorld> gtk*
[02:54:04] <imolorhe> basically the time it takes depends on the number of elements to go through
[02:54:27] <Cork> that and how much you hit the browsers built in optimizations
[02:54:30] <imolorhe> Based on the little profiling I've done
[02:54:39] <Cork> id and classes has hash tables in the browser
[02:54:45] <Cork> so they are very fast to search for
[02:54:50] <Cork> [] doesn't
[02:54:56] <imolorhe> so basically I should replace the data attribute selectors with ID?
[02:55:06] <Cork> if the id is always unique yes
[02:55:14] <Cork> page globally unique that is
[02:55:16] <imolorhe> same as the input element?
[02:55:22] <imolorhe> Hmm..
[02:55:24] <Cork> yes
[02:55:27] <Cork> class works well too though
[02:55:34] <Cork> it is very close in speed to id
[02:55:59] <Cork> and if you have a unique id you can just do $('#the-id')
[02:56:01] <imolorhe> How do you recommend I make them always unique? I had an idea of creating a string for each but that can't always be guaranteed
[02:56:24] <Cork> imolorhe: if they aren't unique by design i would use a class instead
[02:56:58] <Cork> if they are unique, but might collide with unrelated ids
[02:57:07] <Cork> then ya put an identifyer infront
[02:57:55] <imolorhe> ok thanks
[02:57:58] <imolorhe> Will try that now
[03:14:28] <imolorhe> Cork: Hello :)
[03:15:22] <DelphiWorld> is there a way to load a twitter feed without twitterapi key?
[03:15:53] <Cork> DelphiWorld: not really
[03:16:05] <imolorhe> Performance improved 4x over
[03:16:12] <Cork> heh
[03:16:13] <DelphiWorld> Cork: ok so i'lle just look for a follow button...
[03:16:22] <Cork> i would say that is a nice start :)
[03:17:11] <imolorhe> Total time taken to traverse and render dropped from 8605ms to 2984ms
[03:17:33] <imolorhe> Yep...it takes that long
[03:17:34] <Omar-> DelphiWorld I dont think so, you will need a key
[03:17:49] <imolorhe> That is on IE Edge
[03:22:25] <imolorhe> Cork: No significant improvement on chrome
[03:23:20] <Cork> imolorhe: you could section up the new data in smaller chunks
[03:26:12] <imolorhe> Smaller chunks?
[03:26:27] <Cork> the new data you add
[03:26:39] <Cork> make each ajax chunk contain less data
[03:26:43] <Cork> and pull more times instead
[03:49:37] <youness1307> Hi every one I have a problem with a cross domain request in basic authentification,  can anyone help me?     Please https://www.refheap.com/98338
[03:58:02] <youness1307> No one?
[04:16:24] <Cork> youness1307: ppl helping in here do it out of there "free time"
[04:16:32] <Cork> so you might have to wait a little from time to time
[04:17:06] <Cork> youness1307: you can't do what you're trying to do if the server doesn't set cors headers
[04:17:10] <Cork> there is nothing you can do
[04:17:25] <Cork> (well except proxying it over another server)
[04:54:00] <jQuer-A> Hey Guys  I am trying to implement this "Moving Nodes" codepen in my wordpress but I can not seem to get it working
[04:54:01] <jQuer-A> http://codepen.io/thetwistedtaste/pen/GgrWLp
[04:54:16] <jQuer-A> Does somebody has some time to help me?
[04:55:28] <Cork> jQuer-A: you want to use it as a background or what?
[04:55:34] <jQuer-A> yes as background
[04:56:10] <Cork> make the canvas position absoulte
[04:56:26] <Cork> and put a container (or main?) element ontop through position:relative
[04:56:32] <Cork> that should be all you need
[04:57:47] <jQuer-A> I did Cork I think it's more the problem of the jQuery that it's not loading
[04:58:21] <Cork> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/JomMpG
[04:58:35] <Cork> well can't really help much there unless you have an example of the problem
[04:58:52] <Cork> and if you need help digging through wordpress html code i prob don't have the time
[04:59:48] <jQuer-A> Cork: Ok thx anyways, the theme says this when adding custom JS "To use jQuery code wrap it into jQuery(function($){ ... });" should I wrap the whole code in it?
[05:00:28] <Cork> jQuer-A: jQuery(function($) {}) is a way to call the ready function
[05:00:37] <Cork> and redefine the $ to be jquery
[05:01:16] <Cork> that might be good for what you need, but most likely you only need it for a portion of it
[05:01:38] <Cork> jQuer-A: an alternative is to wrap it in (function($) {})(jQuery);
[05:02:02] <Cork> that will just make sure $ is jquery, without also delaying everything with .ready
[05:02:10] <Cork> then you can run the ready where you need it
[05:02:17] <Cork> but that depends on what you need
[05:02:55] <jQuer-A> Cork: ok i'll try some of the options. the code, the function code from codepen should that be wrapped inside the code you just write up?
[05:03:07] <jQuer-A> or should I edit the function to the code what you just wrote
[05:03:18] <Cork> didn't look at it that much
[05:03:28] <youness1307> (youness1307) Hi every one I have a problem with a cross domain request in basic authentification,  can anyone help me?     Please https://www.refheap.com/98338
[05:04:20] <Cork> jQuer-A: line 73 should be changed to jQuery(function($) {
[05:04:23] <Cork> the rest should work as is
[05:04:32] <Cork> youness1307: already answered that a while back
[05:06:56] <youness1307> Hi Cork excuse me but I found no answer can you copy paste the answer please
[05:07:42] <Cork> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/default_%23jquery_20150312.log.html
[05:07:45] <Cork> search for your nick
[05:10:38] <jQuer-A> Cork: Well can't get it working, damn wp, but thx anyways for your help
[05:12:05] <Uhkis> damn damn damn that wp!
[05:14:47] <_eddy> hi guys i dont know how to do this so i need some ideas please. Basically i have a list of items on my site but the list it long up to 20. Anyways i want to make it slide left and right when some click on a button pointing to either left or right
[05:15:04] <DelphiWorld> css making me mad;(
[05:15:18] <DelphiWorld> how to center a element?
[05:15:35] <Cork> _eddy: you would have to bind keydown event handlers
[05:15:53] <DelphiWorld> youness1307: allé quité free mobile;-)
[05:15:53] <Cork> DelphiWorld: horizontally or vertically?
[05:16:06] <DelphiWorld> Omar-: tel Cork please your vision? :P
[05:16:33] <youness1307> Thanks Cork,  but it seems that domain allows cross domain
[05:16:53] <Cork> youness1307: you have cors headers in the response?
[05:16:57] <youness1307> Delphiworld j'y pense !
[05:17:02] <Cork> and it says it allows your domain?
[05:18:23] <DreamStiffler> anyone can help me with freemarker?
[05:18:28] <DreamStiffler> the channels dead
[05:18:32] <_eddy> Cork: how can i first make sure that only 4 items are shown on the first list? then the other will be in the sliding part
[05:19:30] <Uhkis> ?demo @ _eddy
[05:19:30] <b-ot> _eddy: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:20:09] <_eddy> Uhkis: if I had an idea of how to start i will create demo
[05:20:37] <Cork> _eddy: that is hard to answer generically
[05:20:43] <Cork> there are several ways to do that
[05:21:37] <youness1307> Cork if they ask for a login and a password they accept all domain no?
[05:21:44] <Cork> no
[05:21:59] <Cork> youness1307: the request you send has to get a cors header response
[05:22:06] <Cork> ?mdn cors
[05:22:07] <b-ot> Cork: CORs - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[05:22:33] <Cork> ex. Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://foo.example.com
[05:23:03] <Cork> if the browser doesn't see that header in the response, it will block you from accessing the data
[05:23:15] <Cork> (for good reason)
[05:24:35] <_eddy> Uhkis: image you have 20 image of shoes and you want to show them all. It will take over half of the web page so to stop this you want to show 4 at a time and if someone wants to see more then can then click on a left or right button to slide and show the next 4 then the next 4 and so on.
[05:24:40] <_eddy> That is what I wanna do
[05:26:01] <Omar-> Cork this is how I usually center an element hoz/ver .element { position: absolute; height: 50px; width: 50px; margin: auto; left: 0; top: 0; right: 0: bottom: 0; }
[05:26:09] <Uhkis> so you're looking for an image carousel
[05:26:24] <Cork> Omar-: there are normally better ways
[05:26:45] <Cork> ripping the content out of the text flow is often not what you want
[05:26:56] <Cork> but ya, it might be in some cases
[05:27:52] <Cork> so, not dissing the answer, just careful not to give a premature answer as the answer differ a lot depending where you want to do it
[05:31:26] <_eddy> Uhkis: maybe this is a better example http://wowslider.com/sliders/demo-59/demo.jpg
[05:31:37] <R13ose> If I have an image that is is only text and I want to scroll in the text within the image should I use the image or plain text?  Either way, how do I scroll in the text or image from the right?
[05:32:34] <_eddy> Cork: any ideas please?
[05:35:18] <Uhkis> _eddy: just pick one of those million sliders and be done with it?
[05:44:29] <JohnDow> anyone using zurb foundation? i'm from codeigniter, just joined here
[05:45:16] <JohnDow> menu icon is not showing up when used with codeigniter, but when used in a regular html file it would show up
[05:45:43] <JohnDow> css and js files are properly linked to my src and hrefs
[05:48:06] <Uhkis> how is this jquery-related?
[05:49:11] <JohnDow> isn't foundation's top bar is made with jquery? correct me if im wrong
[05:51:54] <R13ose> any thoughts on my question?
[05:55:03] <Oka> Could you repeat the question?
[06:01:51] <R13ose> Oka: Different question as I will solve the other one later.  I am having a hard time showing the right images at the right points.  Here is the code: http://pastebin.com/MePvGfnP
[06:04:11] <youness1307> Cors : that's the httpheader of servers response      HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized Date: Thu, 12 Mar 2015 13:01:19 GMT Content-Length: 0 WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=tnopendata Via: 1.1 192.168.203.92 (McAfee Web Gateway 7.3.2.8.0.17286), 1.1 pbluco02 Cache-Control: proxy-revalidate Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive Connection: Keep-Alive Proxy-support: Session-based-authentication
[06:04:58] <Cork> youness1307: well that is just that the auth data isn't correct
[06:05:04] <Cork> but ya, no cors header
[06:05:42] <Cork> and as you need a basic auth user and password it can't really be done from js, as you would have to expose the credentials to the visiting user
[06:08:36] <R13ose> Hi Cork
[06:09:57] <youness1307> Cork : It's a user and password for developers.  It's an api for requesting real time transport schedule
[06:10:23] <Cork> youness1307: yes, but it isn't a public user and password
[06:10:29] <Cork> cause then they wouldn't have to have it
[06:10:46] <Cork> so you are effectively planing to leak the credentials
[06:11:33] <Cork> youness1307: the system is designed for your server to make the connection
[06:11:38] <Cork> and the webpage to ask your server
[06:12:02] <Cork> not the webpage making direct connections from the visitors browser to there api
[06:19:21] <youness1307> Cork,  so If I understand I can do this kind of request throw a server but not on a client browser
[06:19:48] <Cork> youness1307: if you do it in js you are effectively asking the visitor to do it
[06:19:54] <Cork> you make the connection as them
[06:19:58] <Cork> (including there cookies)
[06:20:12] <Cork> and that is why cors normally forbit it
[06:20:15] <Cork> *forbid
[06:21:00] <youness1307> I want to develop a Firefox OS app,  only in jquery and html.  So I can't use this api in my context
[06:21:15] <Cork> hmm
[06:21:27] <Cork> ya, that's not a grate idea
[06:21:50] <Cork> i would recommend contacting the mozilla amo team and see if they have an idea for how to solve that
[06:22:23] <Cork> the solution migth be that the user has to get there own account
[06:22:32] <Cork> but there might be another option
[06:23:51] <ech0s7> how could i pass as argument from html a js object ?
[06:24:02] <ech0s7> https://jsfiddle.net/v1r1md91/
[06:24:17] <Cork> you don't pass arguments from html, html isn't a programming language
[06:24:19] <Cork> its a markup
[06:24:37] <Cork> ugg
[06:24:41] <Cork> and don't use event attributes
[06:24:49] <cordovafan8> Hello again. I have a jquery mobile 1.3 flip toggle switch slider set up, but I cannot seem to get it to work. I am trying to get a nice 'mobile options slider' (on/off) working, and I've followed the description here: http://api.jquerymobile.com/slider/ .  My slider is set up identically to the example they provide, but I see an empty select drop down in chrome. Is there another solution for a mobile-style flipswitch in jquery 
[06:26:52] <Cork> ech0s7: https://jsfiddle.net/v1r1md91/4/
[06:29:21] <youness1307> Thank you very much Cork for your help
[06:36:04] <Themaawaa> good afternoon
[06:36:10] <Themaawaa> Can someone help me with something?
[06:36:21] <Cork> ?ask @ Themaawaa
[06:36:21] <b-ot> Themaawaa: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:39:49] <Themaawaa> how do i get my scrolling thing to the right center?
[06:39:51] <Themaawaa> http://jsfiddle.net/nv6pez95/
[06:41:14] <hait> ech0s7: May be you're looking for this https://jsfiddle.net/v1r1md91/5/
[06:43:35] <BillCriswell> ech0s7: If that data is coming from an array of some sort I'd look it up instead of putting it in the element like that.
[06:45:51] <Themaawaa> Want to center scrolling text vertical and horizontal http://jsfiddle.net/nv6pez95/
[06:46:51] <BillCriswell> Themaawaa: Is it always one line of text?
[06:47:09] <Themaawaa> Not always no BillCrisswell
[06:49:12] <BillCriswell> Depending on your browser requirements this might be useful: http://zerosixthree.se/vertical-align-anything-with-just-3-lines-of-css/
[06:51:40] <Themaawaa> Hey Bill. I've already read this article but it proved no help. I'd specifically like to align the text to right center, but with scrolling elements (the js) but when I do that, the text doesn't use the given width for the scroll.
[06:59:37] <Cork> heh scary...
[06:59:42] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/t1qb0tsq/
[07:04:30] <cordovafan8> what is the recommended way to make a mobile options toggle slider in jquery mobile pre-1.4 ?
[07:05:13] <BillCriswell> Themaawaa: The text aligning right would just be text-align: right;
[07:06:19] <BillCriswell> Themaawaa: Why are you setting the width to 1440?
[07:12:20] <cordovafan8> does anyone know why this fiddle would not display correctly for me in chrome? http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/mp02u7ec/   The only difference I have is that the html elements (the select etc) are loaded into a div dynamically. I have tried calling .trigger("create") with no luck.
[07:12:43] <cordovafan8> err by not display correctly in chrome I mean my code does not, the fiddle appears to work correctly
[07:15:57] <Themaawaa> @BillCriswell   the width is that so it correctly displays the scrolling text on the page
[07:16:25] <bigstylee> cordovafan8 try $(document).ajaxCompleted(function(){$('#flip-1').slider()});
[07:18:32] <bigstylee> *$(document).ajaxComplete (omitt the 'd')
[07:18:47] <cordovafan8> bigstylee: my slider() call is already in the ajax success function
[07:19:14] <cordovafan8> $.get(blah, function() { $('#flip-1').slider(); }, failure); etc
[07:20:56] <NotHere> what's the best way to check if a jquery object is empty or not? $('#nonexistent').isEmptyObject()?
[07:21:15] <cordovafan8> bigstylee: to be clear, it seems like some jquery mobile styles are being applied, the slider just doesn't display like the documentation suggests. It appears as a select drop-down.
[07:21:21] <Cork> NotHere: length > 0
[07:23:56] <bigstylee> if its appearing as a select drop down then the styles are not being applied. either because they are not loaded correctly or because the element is not being intialised
[07:23:59] <cordovafan8> bigstylee: It looks like this in the end: http://imgur.com/p59hns1
[07:24:50] <bigstylee> does it look the same if you have js disabled and load the page?
[07:25:11] <cordovafan8> bigstylee: http://pastebin.com/y9nrnGxp << this is the resulting html
[07:25:19] <cordovafan8> I willl try to disable js good idea hang on
[07:26:02] <bigstylee> this looks like to me that you have not included the CSS on your page
[07:27:37] <cordovafan8> I was thinking this as well earlier, but how does that happen? It's a jqm application so all the js and css is included in the <head> of the first page, and that should be transferred?
[07:27:59] <bigstylee> do you have any other libraries on your page that could be colliding? the marked up you just provided is significantly different to the mark up in the fiddle
[07:28:00] <NotHere> thanks Cork
[07:29:05] <cordovafan8> bigstylee: unfortunately I have a few yes. There is bootstrap and jquery ui.
[07:30:10] <bigstylee> http://jqueryui.com/slider/ collision found
[07:32:02] <bigstylee> id suggest you redownload juqeryui http://jqueryui.com/download/ and omitt the slider widget
[07:32:41] <cordovafan8> bigstylee: argh, good find. Will the data-role="slider"  be overriden by jquery ui? It doesn't make any sense that they would use the same data role
[07:32:51] <cordovafan8> hrmm we're already using a custom one
[07:33:01] <cordovafan8> let me see if I can find the slider widget
[07:33:22] <bigstylee> its not the data-role, is the function slider() which is implemented by both libraries which is the issue
[07:34:25] <cordovafan8> well if I omit slider() it should be initialized anyway, and the same effect occurs, so I assume that there is some confusion about which widget to initialize
[07:34:54] <cordovafan8> is there a way to get a mobile-style flip-switch with jquery ui? Or a different way to do it with jqm 1.3 ?
[07:35:11] <cordovafan8> I am not married to the slider method, it just seems to be the only one I could find
[07:35:55] <bigstylee> https://github.com/aFarkas/jMediaelement/issues/17
[07:37:54] <cordovafan8> bigstylee: I am a bit beyond my depth here, would that code go in my initialization? (maybe on mobileinit)?
[07:38:57] <bigstylee> do you need the jqueryui slider functionality?
[07:39:29] <cordovafan8> bigstylee: no, I just need a basic flipswitch
[07:39:46] <cordovafan8> basically one of those mobile options you set to 'on' or 'off'
[07:39:52] <cordovafan8> but I'm stuck on jqm 1.3
[07:39:53] <bigstylee> so, remove it
[07:40:24] <cordovafan8> you mean remove the slider from jquery ui or use this aliasing method? I need jquery ui for other things
[07:40:36] <bigstylee> remove the slider from jquery ui
[07:41:19] <bigstylee> so when you download juqeryui you can select which widgets/components/features you want. select the ones you want and not slider. include in your project. done
[07:44:04] <vibrasfear> hey. how would i get the current state of an element i toggle()?
[07:44:07] <cordovafan8> bigstylee: unfortunately i don't really have that kind of control over the project. There might be other places that need the slider (it's a big project, so I am not 100%), and I don't really have permission to change the libraries at this time either, so I would really prefer not to have to do that?
[07:44:16] <skypce> hey guys, i have this site http://108.250.221.197:8082/   in responsive  mobile the last slideshow doesnt work , why ?* please thank you in advance
[07:44:26] <Cork> vibrasfear: current .is(':visible')
[07:44:30] <vibrasfear> ta
[07:44:45] <Cork> vibrasfear: i would prob recommend using toggleClass instead though
[07:45:11] <vibrasfear> and hasClass
[07:45:16] <vibrasfear> okay. why?
[07:45:40] <Cork> :visible check for css properties to try to guess if it is visible or not
[07:45:45] <Cork> a class is cleaner
[07:45:54] <Cork> and you can do more then just hide the element if you need
[07:45:56] <Cork> +to
[07:46:25] <vibrasfear> super, thx
[07:49:05] <bigstylee> can you change the order in which the js files are included?
[07:49:39] <Cork> sure, move the tags
[07:50:27] <bigstylee> yes Cork, question was aimed at cordovafan8 to help solve his problem
[07:50:39] <Cork> ah, lol
[07:51:13] <cordovafan8> haha
[07:52:06] <skypce> hey guys, i have this site http://108.250.221.197:8082/   in responsive  mobile the last slideshow doesnt work , why ?* please thank you in advance
[07:52:41] <vibrasfear> is there a chrome developer extension that allows for highlighting block level elements (just like in firebug...)?
[07:52:56] <vibrasfear> err, web developer addon, not firebug
[07:54:15] <cjohnson> you mean the thing that's built into chrome vibrasfear?
[07:54:20] <cordovafan8> bigstylee: I can, but I am running this application on cordova, which requires a pretty strict ordering of javascript files unfortunately. Anything before jqm will cause an issue with the bootstrapping. Is there no way to just call $.mobile('selector').slider() or equivalent?
[07:54:23] <cjohnson> when you mouse over an element in the dom inspector is highlights it on the page
[07:54:32] <vibrasfear> no not that one
[07:54:34] <vibrasfear> i found it
[07:54:45] <cjohnson> what do you mean out of curiosity
[07:54:49] <vibrasfear> there's a web developer addon for chrome that does what the firefox thing does
[07:55:02] <vibrasfear> it allows for adding a 1 px border around all block elements
[07:55:10] <vibrasfear> for layout debugging
[07:57:43] <jacquerie> vibrasfear, something like this? http://arqex.com/939/learning-much-javascript-one-line-code
[07:57:46] <bigstylee> try $('selector').mobile.slider();
[07:58:42] <cordovafan8> undefined :x
[08:00:16] <vibrasfear> ya
[08:00:27] <vibrasfear> thxie
[08:02:03] <R13ose> Hi
[08:04:01] <bigstylee> sorry, out of ideas
[08:04:48] <bigstylee> unadvised, but you could go into the jqm js and renamed jQuery.fn.slider = to something else
[08:06:18] <R13ose> Code: http://pastebin.com/pDyeyXTS Getting the first if to scroll in from the right and second if in from the left.  First works but second goes on forever and scrolls in from the right.  At moment second one only scrolling working not both at different times.  Any ideas?
[08:07:30] <Omar-> which is better when dragging an element. 1) update left & top values or use translate3d(x,y,z)?
[08:07:53] <Omar-> 1) update left & top values
[08:07:53] <Omar-> 2) use translate3d(x,y,z)?
[08:10:30] <Omar-> cordovafan8
[08:10:55] <Omar-> what's your problem with slider?
[08:11:00] <cordovafan8> bigstylee: YOU'RE A GENIUS. I can get it to display semi-correctly by aliassing the jquery mobile slider() to something else, then using it later (since jqm is loaded first for me, I can't do it the other way around). $.fn.mobileslider = $.fn.slider;  << before loading jq ui :D
[08:11:14] <cordovafan8> Omar-: It seems that jquery ui is overriding the slider() from jqm
[08:11:48] <cordovafan8> I don't have the option of swapping the order that the libraries load, or really replace the jq ui library so it doesn't contain the slider widget
[08:11:56] <cordovafan8> so bigstylee suggested aliasing the function
[08:12:02] <Omar-> cordovafan8 mixing ui and jqm is tricky
[08:12:08] <cordovafan8> so I am learning
[08:14:38] <Omar-> cordovafan8 I hope you're learning and not "suffering" with cordova :P
[08:14:58] <cordovafan8> a little bit of both
[08:14:59] <cordovafan8> :D
[08:19:30] <Omar-> good luck :)
[08:21:59] <vibrasfear> rumour has it jqm and ui are going to merge
[08:23:07] <imolorhe> Cork: now performing all the actions in 200ms :)
[08:23:09] <skypce> hey guys, i have this site http://108.250.221.197:8082/   in responsive  mobile the last slideshow doesnt work , why ?* please thank you in advance
[08:24:17] <Omar-> vibrasfear it's not a rumour, they are working on it
[08:29:15] <MikeD_> does $.map() honor the new order of an array after it's .sort()ed?
[08:29:57] <xec> MikeD_: i would assume so. try it?
[08:30:59] <MikeD_> i am trying it, and no matter which way i put:  return a > b; or return a < b; i get the same result
[08:32:23] <xec> maybe it's not getting sorted at all? try logging the array before and after sorting
[08:37:16] <cordovafan8> Omar-: do you know how to get rid of this ugly bar behind the <label> for the slider widget? http://imgur.com/o9vWvEt  << I'm again just using the standard code from the jquery mobile slider widget documentation for the flip toggle switch
[08:47:40] <zackiv31> is there a way to define jquery only to a scoped variable without copy/pasting the source code ?

[08:50:54] <frabblerock> I need to filter subcategories by checkbox
[08:51:00] <frabblerock> so for example, if you click dance
[08:51:05] <frabblerock> there is subcategories
[08:51:15] <robertmaxrees> if you need a freelancer, please go to a channel about freelancing.  not really appropriate for here :)
[08:51:25] <frabblerock> don't need a freelancer, just need help
[08:51:40] <robertmaxrees> you know what i mean though :)
[08:51:51] <cjohnson> you want somebody to write code for you, help is having somebody assist you with your code
[08:51:54] <frabblerock> if a user clicks "classes" hide all events under Dance except classes
[08:51:56] <cjohnson> if you don't want to write it you want a freelancer
[08:52:05] <frabblerock> that's not what I implied.

[08:52:18] <frabblerock>  need some help, I'd be willing to pay for it.
[08:52:19] <robertmaxrees> right, not the right place for that.

[08:52:33] <robertmaxrees> right.
[08:52:35] <frabblerock> I did not say

[08:52:58] <cjohnson> this isn't a channel for writing code for people
[08:53:16] <frabblerock> cjohnson - where did I say i need someone to write code for me?
[08:53:25] <cjohnson> the line above mine
[08:53:31] <frabblerock> right
[08:53:34] <mooncup> frabblerock: I'm doing a special deal this week
[08:53:37] <mooncup> 2 codes for the price of 1

[08:55:26] <KerDAnny> Hi guys, would anyone have any idea as to how to hide a <p> until a textbox on the same field has had text input?
[08:55:32] <KerDAnny> same page even
[08:55:39] <mooncup> KerDAnny: start it off hiden
[08:55:42] <mooncup> hidden
[08:55:51] <mooncup> then bind to the change / input events on the input field
[08:56:01] <KerDAnny> so just display none or set in the jquery?
[08:56:06] <robertmaxrees> display none.
[08:56:11] <mooncup> and when val().length > 0 show the p
[08:56:24] <robertmaxrees> or just if (val().length)
[08:56:27] <robertmaxrees> since 0 is falsy
[08:56:34] <mooncup> or that
[08:56:52] <KerDAnny> thanks guys
[08:56:56] <KerDAnny> will try it now!
[08:57:47] <R13ose> How do I make sure all the rules in this code are working: http://pastebin.com/X5jG0c4B  The last else if is the one that is not showing correct elements.
[08:58:01] <robertmaxrees> use a step debugger.
[08:58:21] <mooncup> or put a console log inside each if
[08:58:24] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 is a fantastic guide.
[08:58:28] <mooncup> and see what you get outputted to the console
[08:59:04] <randomguy> > 2050 is also >= 1350
[08:59:44] <robertmaxrees> that too.  once you hit >=1350 you'll never hit 2050
[08:59:45] <KerDAnny> never knew there was a jquery IRC, will probably use this more often now
[09:00:02] <robertmaxrees> also also you should cache your selectors since you're in a scroll event listener.
[09:00:03] <frabblerock> if anyone wants to HELP - please look here; http://pastebin.com/jjJez75Z
[09:00:51] <robertmaxrees> which part of this are you stuck on?
[09:01:08] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you have an entire task to figure out - have you tried breaking the problem down at all?
[09:01:41] <frabblerock> right now, it's filtering parent categories
[09:01:52] <frabblerock> the problem is filtering when selecting a child category
[09:02:14] <frabblerock> how to get it to hide events that are not of that child category, then show them again if the user unchecks that textbox.
[09:02:42] <frabblerock> hide events that are not of the child category WITHIN the parent category that is
[09:02:54] <R13ose> randomguy: thanks looking into that.
[09:02:57] <frabblerock> so the child categories is the part im stuck on
[09:02:59] <KerDAnny> how do i add css inside an if statement?
[09:03:08] <robertmaxrees> KerDAnny the way you do anywhere else?
[09:03:38] <frabblerock> i've looked into different plugins, like mixitup and isotype, but none of them really have any examples of filtering within a filter
[09:03:39] <robertmaxrees> frabblerock okay, so it looks like you need to create a custom filter here.
[09:03:50] <robertmaxrees> right, becuase that's not really what you want.
[09:04:01] <KerDAnny> so $(this).css()?
[09:04:07] <robertmaxrees> KerDAnny err, no.
[09:04:13] <robertmaxrees> paste an example.
[09:04:20] <robertmaxrees> frabblerock you need to be able to tag items with multiple categories.
[09:04:28] <KerDAnny> $(document).ready(function() {         if ($('display-after').val().length){             $(this).css('display: block').fadeIn();         }     });
[09:04:29] <robertmaxrees> the parent -> child relationship is arbitrary in this case.
[09:04:42] <robertmaxrees> KerDAnny still needs to be $('.display-after') in that case.
[09:05:09] <robertmaxrees> the 'this' objects (and by extension $(this)) has to do with functions and context.
[09:05:41] <frabblerock> an event will only have one parent and one sub
[09:05:50] <robertmaxrees> right, that's irrelevant.
[09:05:56] <robertmaxrees> you need to work around the way to filters work.
[09:06:41] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sure of the particulars of your given filtering system, but you need to make it so that selecting the parent selects every item with any subcategory under it OR have the ability to tag items with more than one "category"
[09:07:50] <KerDAnny> doesn't display still, nothing happens to the paragraph
[09:08:00] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle please :)
[09:09:16] <robertmaxrees> because you're missing the part about the event listener :D
[09:10:15] <R13ose> randomguy: Thanks that was the issue.
[09:10:35] <randomguy> R13ose: cool
[09:10:51] <ZadYree> Hello! having a <div data-foo data-bar="baz"></div>, when I trigger my action via JQuery with $('[data-foo]'), I would like to get the data-bar attribute value of the very div. Does it work to directly place $(this).attr('[data-bar]') ?
[09:11:08] <robertmaxrees> no.
[09:11:14] <robertmaxrees> $(this).data('bar')
[09:11:41] <ZadYree> aaahhh, nice!
[09:11:43] <ZadYree> thanks!
[09:11:48] <KerDAnny> here's the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/danjambur/1tj2L0c5/
[09:12:08] <robertmaxrees> cool, okay, so do you see the problem?
[09:12:12] <robertmaxrees> you're just checking when the page loads.
[09:13:13] <KerDAnny> I've changed it to onDOMready, still nothing
[09:13:22] <robertmaxrees> you want the document ready.
[09:13:29] <robertmaxrees> but that's  not the problem.  that just checks when the page loads
[09:14:03] <KerDAnny> i don't follow?
[09:14:05] <robertmaxrees> you need something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1tj2L0c5/1/
[09:14:37] <robertmaxrees> in the browser, you need to use event listeners to kick off stuff like this.
[09:15:21] <robertmaxrees> but this code doesn't work.
[09:15:23] <robertmaxrees> do you see why?
[09:16:05] <KerDAnny> can't say i do :(
[09:16:13] <robertmaxrees> $('display-after') doesn't work.  you need $('.display-after')
[09:16:24] <KerDAnny> oh god hahaha
[09:16:27] <robertmaxrees> the . in front of a word makes it a class lookup like in css.
[09:16:32] <Omar-> is there a way I can make this code better? http://pastie.org/private/7npx8dhrjq8llv3hz4v7fa
[09:16:33] <robertmaxrees> but even then it still won't work :)
[09:16:42] <KerDAnny> rookie move
[09:17:10] <robertmaxrees> .css() doesn't take a single string like that.  to set a css property, you do .css('property', 'value');  so in your case, it'd be .css('display', 'block');
[09:17:13] <robertmaxrees> or just use .show()
[09:17:42] <KerDAnny> thanks so much!
[09:17:53] <robertmaxrees> oh and use the css panel for css.
[09:17:53] <KerDAnny> easiest things to miss, i'll get the hang of it eventually
[09:17:56] <robertmaxrees> don't do inline styles.
[09:22:37] <KerDAnny> thanks. I've added a delay but it's not making any difference, why is that?
[09:22:49] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle.
[09:24:28] <KerDAnny> http://jsfiddle.net/danjambur/1tj2L0c5/
[09:24:43] <robertmaxrees> this is missing the updates :(
[09:25:41] <KerDAnny> https://jsfiddle.net/danjambur/1tj2L0c5/3/
[09:26:01] <robertmaxrees> so you want it to show and then fade it in?
[09:26:29] <robertmaxrees> ;) https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1tj2L0c5/5/ you want this.
[09:26:46] <KerDAnny> well just fade in after a delay
[09:26:57] <robertmaxrees> then you'll need to use a timeout.
[09:27:07] <robertmaxrees> .delay() only works on animation queues.
[09:27:54] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1tj2L0c5/6/
[09:30:48] <KerDAnny> i've added .timeout in place of .delay
[09:31:03] <KerDAnny> still just jumps in and no fade :(
[09:31:06] <robertmaxrees> right.
[09:31:08] <KerDAnny> sorry im a noob
[09:31:09] <KerDAnny> https://jsfiddle.net/danjambur/1tj2L0c5/3/
[09:31:09] <robertmaxrees> look at my last example.
[09:31:40] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1tj2L0c5/6/ is what you want.
[09:32:02] <decx> back to the full name again eh? you ARE prince
[09:32:11] <robertmaxrees> heh feeling better today.
[09:32:12] <decx> tomorrow it'll be ☃
[09:32:17] <robertmaxrees> had a rough weekend.
[09:32:35] <frabblerock> robertmaxrees
[09:32:40] <decx> bad gig?
[09:32:40] <frabblerock> if yout ake a look at the html
[09:32:51] <KerDAnny> thanks robert. Why is the 1000 outside of the closing }?
[09:33:02] <robertmaxrees> decx major family event.
[09:33:05] <decx> that's the syntax for settimeout
[09:33:14] <frabblerock> events have data-category="{{parent category}}" data-subcategory="{{child category}}"
[09:33:19] <robertmaxrees> KerDAnny because settimeout takes two arguments.  the first is the function, the second is the amount of time.
[09:33:30] <KerDAnny> ahhh.
[09:33:39] <robertmaxrees> window.setTimeout(function() {}, 1000)
[09:34:07] <rubyonrailed> I set up an autosave, but I don't want it to save from time.  On click seems to be very unreliable, what's the best way to autosave a form that users are using?
[09:34:44] <decx> push the contents into localstorage on change
[09:36:06] <MikeD_> fwiw, sort() function needs to return -1,0,1 not boolean true/false  (duh)
[09:36:24] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[09:37:19] <robertmaxrees> oooh hahahaha got tripped up?
[09:38:44] <rubyonrailed> decx: Thanks, dunno why i forgot about on change
[09:40:23] <jsc802> hello
[09:40:37] <RobotNinjaPS> I guess no one uses datetimepicker where you can also pick minutes right? just pick hours and write minutes IF needed by hand
[09:40:47] <jsc802> there is a dropdown menu in a page that does something dynamically when one of the options is selected by user
[09:40:53] <jsc802> how do i simulate that selection with jquery?
[09:41:04] <jsc802>  $('#element option[value="no"]').attr("selected", "selected");
[09:41:04] <jsc802>  does not work
[09:41:10] <robertmaxrees> abstract things out so you're not siumulating things.
[09:41:28] <jsc802> i dont have ability to modify their jquery code
[09:41:30] <robertmaxrees> *simulating
[09:41:34] <robertmaxrees> ew.
[09:41:37] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to use .trigger() then
[09:41:45] <robertmaxrees> .trigger('click') or whatever
[09:42:08] <jsc802> ok googling trigger select option
[09:42:32] <DeoSama> can anyone please explain to me why the this last if statement (if(flag)) isn't running in order?
[09:42:32] <DeoSama> http://pastebin.com/7MM53nwk
[09:42:38] <robertmaxrees> or .prop('selected', true); then .trigger('change'); on the parent select.
[09:42:41] <kavi> Hi am trying to use the slick jquery library in our website.When i use slidetoscroll attribute my browser crashes . other than everything looks good . any idea . y ?
[09:43:01] <robertmaxrees> "isn't running order" DeoSama?
[09:43:07] <kavi> the browser is crashing only when i click on the dots
[09:43:15] <DeoSama> it's running through the code, returning flag (which is true), loading the next page, and then running the if statement (or at least that's when i get the console.log())
[09:43:30] <Omar-> when an element is scaled "scale()" does it get its' position().left/top updated?
[09:43:41] <robertmaxrees> DeoSama fwiw the return doesn't wait for the $.get() to finish.
[09:43:48] <robertmaxrees> that's async.
[09:43:54] <DeoSama> hmmmm
[09:43:55] <robertmaxrees> same with the timeout.
[09:44:07] <DeoSama> how can i fix it? :(
[09:44:10] <robertmaxrees> you're basically building in a timeout plus have another async dealio running.
[09:44:21] <robertmaxrees> use deferreds.
[09:44:24] <robertmaxrees> brb
[09:53:22] <d10n-work> Why does $('<h1>foo</h1>').find('h1') return no results? http://jsfiddle.net/c1e3zf70/
[09:53:47] <robertmaxrees> .find() looks for child elements.
[09:54:01] <robertmaxrees> you're starting at the h1 - there are no child h1 elements of it.
[09:54:24] <d10n-work> ah, thanks
[09:56:05] <Omar-> what's the recommended time elapsed between double touches to determine whether it's a pinch or not?
[09:56:12] <d10n-work> Is there a nice way to find all the top-level H1 elements?
[09:56:12] <Omar-> 200 ms?
[09:57:02] <Omar-> d10n-work top-level related to which element?
[09:57:19] <randomguy> d10n-work: possibly $('h1').filter(function(){ $(this).children().length == 0 });
[09:58:01] <randomguy> d10n-work: possibly $('h1').filter(function(){ return $(this).children().length == 0; });
[09:59:02] <d10n-work> thanks randomguy, I think I'll settle with $('<div>' + topLevelTagString + '</div>').find :)         Omar- no context element, just an html string
[09:59:20] <randomguy> d10n-work: or if your searching a parent, $(selector).find('> h1')
[10:00:28] <R13ose> afk
[10:01:20] <cordovafan8> thanks to everyone who helped me with the slider business
[10:01:29] <cordovafan8> I have finally got a slider that looks good :D
[10:01:47] <DeoSama> robertmaxrees, awesome, thanks man! THat totally worked! :D
[10:09:13] <decx> i also have slider that looks good, his name is quinn mallory
[10:11:46] <Omar-> decx lol
[10:12:18] <Omar-> I have asked 200 questions so far, none of them was answered
[10:12:27] <Omar-> thank you #jquery!!!!
[10:12:55] <decx> and we've always thought there were no stupid questions
[10:13:13] <decx> jk, do you have a list?
[10:13:39] <robertmaxrees> lols
[10:14:02] * Omar- slaps decx around a bit with a large trout
[10:14:57] <Omar-> dont laugh robertmaxrees, you havent helped me today at all
[10:15:01] <Omar-> :P
[10:15:04] <decx> i've got boiling oil and breadcrumbs, thanks
[10:15:34] <Omar-> decx cooking is better than coding ;)
[10:16:04] <decx> both involve me doing the i have no idea what i'm doing dog meme
[10:16:09] <Omar-> what's the recommended time elapsed between double touches to determine whether it's a pinch or not?
[10:16:22] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:16:27] <Omar-> decx ^^ one of the "unanswered" questions, yet upvoted
[10:16:30] <decx> i use hammer for the heavy lifting
[10:16:30] <Omar-> robertmaxrees lol
[10:16:44] <robertmaxrees> pinch should always happen if you put two fingers down if a context menu hasn't opened.
[10:17:00] <Omar-> oh my bad
[10:17:08] <Omar-> I meant double tap
[10:17:57] <robertmaxrees> i'd say roughly 500ms, but play around and see what feels best to you.
[10:17:57] <Omar-> touchstart 1 => touchend 1 ===> touchstart 2 => touchend 2 ====> fire double tap
[10:18:18] <Omar-> http://jsbin.com/begudo/
[10:18:30] <Omar-> i used 300ms
[10:18:41] <robertmaxrees> play around with it and see what works.
[10:18:57] <Omar-> test it pls, I want your opinion,
[10:19:06] <robertmaxrees> uh i can't right now.
[10:19:09] <robertmaxrees> kind of at work ;)
[10:19:16] <Omar-> no problem :)
[10:19:36] <Omar-> a follow up question, should I fire it with a delay? setTimeout
[10:19:36] <decx> hammer uses 300ms as well
[10:19:59] <Omar-> decx thanks, 300ms is kind of reasonable
[10:20:12] <Omar-> do you know if hammer delays trigger the event?
[10:20:43] <Omar-> triggering*
[10:21:00] <robertmaxrees> check its source to find out?
[10:21:06] <decx> doesnt look like it
[10:22:03] <decx> well the source is extensive, all the more reason to not reinvent the wheel for touchevents ^^
[10:22:17] <robertmaxrees> oh hey what an idea :)
[10:24:22] <cordovafan8> hrmm
[10:24:33] <cordovafan8> looks like I can't use jquery mobile styling for this page
[10:25:03] <cordovafan8> does anyone know how to manually style a jqm flip toggle switch so that one option has a different background color?
[10:28:09] <tasaif> Hello #jquery
[10:31:22] <Omar-> cordovafan8 .flipswitch()
[10:31:35] <Omar-> it's different than .slider()
[10:31:39] <Omar-> hi tasaif
[10:31:56] <Omar-> decx I know hammer has it all, I'm doing this for fun
[10:32:07] <Omar-> and practice
[10:32:36] <decx> now i'm jelly because i havent been able to fun around for a while
[10:33:24] <Omar-> decx well, coding has become the only "escape" for me
[10:33:50] <Omar-> it's not my field nor is it my eductional background
[10:34:09] <Omar-> I work in marketing/sales
[10:34:14] <decx> cordovafan8 data-wrapper-class="customClass" on the element
[10:37:17] <DeoSama> http://pastebin.com/nc4JBscX
[10:37:42] <DeoSama> Could someone please look at this for me and tell me why i'm not getting flag returned if errorCode == null?
[10:37:54] <robertmaxrees> i told you why.
[10:38:04] <DeoSama> hmM?
[10:38:09] <DeoSama> i'm using $.deferred now?
[10:38:28] <DeoSama> var dfd = $.Deferred();
[10:38:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:38:35] <robertmaxrees> you misunderstood.
[10:38:38] <DeoSama> am i not doing it right?
[10:38:40] <robertmaxrees> return flag; on line 30, right?
[10:38:49] <DeoSama> well, any of them
[10:38:49] <DeoSama> haha
[10:38:55] <robertmaxrees> but that's the one that isn't right.
[10:39:01] <DeoSama> i just started throwing them in there because i want it to return anything other than "undefined"
[10:39:10] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:39:22] <robertmaxrees> basically, line 30 doesn't wait for anything.
[10:39:32] <robertmaxrees> and you can't return out of the .done() on the .get() call like that.
[10:39:35] <DeoSama> even though it's in dfd.done()?
[10:39:37] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[10:39:45] <DeoSama> oh
[10:39:47] <DeoSama> hmm
[10:39:49] <robertmaxrees> back out the deferred setup.
[10:39:55] <DeoSama> but the one in the if statement returns fine?
[10:40:06] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter.
[10:40:11] <robertmaxrees> you're convoluting things.
[10:40:15] <DeoSama> haha
[10:40:22] <robertmaxrees> the get call is async - the browser fires it and keeps going.
[10:40:28] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't wait for it to finish.
[10:40:39] <DeoSama> i need it to be sync though
[10:40:43] <DeoSama> i need it to finish. :(
[10:40:44] <robertmaxrees> no.
[10:40:55] <robertmaxrees> because then the browser will lock up.
[10:41:07] <robertmaxrees> any code that relies on it finishing should instead be in that done callback.
[10:41:25] <DeoSama> hm
[10:41:31] <DeoSama> ok
[10:41:42] <robertmaxrees> you just need to restructure things a little.
[10:55:34] <abailarri> Hello. Anyone know any way to have a navigation menu in the bottom of the screen in all screen sizes and when I move the scroll "dis-fix" the navbar? Suggestions?
[10:58:28] <skypce> hi, do you know way to fix the last bootstrap slider in mobile view: http://108.250.221.197:8082/
[10:59:14] <davidpardy> Hello. Why is setTime() not defined here? http://jsfiddle.net/q7000duo/4/
[10:59:57] <robertmaxrees> because you're trying to use it before it's defined.
[11:00:02] <robertmaxrees> use .on() instead.
[11:00:31] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/q7000duo/5/
[11:01:10] <davidpardy> gotcha, thank you. makes sense
[11:09:31] <DragonPunch> i have a quick question. i added a div with jquery using append(). however, when I go to the source it doesn't show the added div in the source.
[11:09:44] <DragonPunch> same with remove. if I remove a div, it does not take it out of the source for me.
[11:09:45] <robertmaxrees> when you do "view source"
[11:09:54] <tasaif> DragonPunch: put it in a fiddle
[11:10:01] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't include anything added/removed with js.
[11:10:11] <DragonPunch> tasaif: no you dont need jsfiddel for everything
[11:10:11] <robertmaxrees> use your browser's dev tools instead.
[11:10:31] <tasaif> DragonPunch: code speaks a thousand words
[11:10:59] <robertmaxrees> tasaif they can probably see the element added to the page.
[11:11:08] <DragonPunch> robertmaxrees: do you know the solution to this?
[11:11:16] <robertmaxrees> don't use view source to look at it.
[11:11:31] <robertmaxrees> that'll never work because that's only what the browser got from the server, never anything added via js.
[11:11:31] <DragonPunch> robertmaxrees: well duh. however, i'm trying to remove an added element.
[11:11:40] <robertmaxrees> you use your developer tools instead.
[11:11:48] <DragonPunch> robertmaxrees: idc about looking at the source, you're failing to see the piont.
[11:11:57] <robertmaxrees> then what's the point?
[11:12:17] <DragonPunch> robertmaxrees: how do you remove an added element if it doesn't show up in the html? becuase i'm appending a div and than trying to remove it however it doesn't work.
[11:12:18] <robertmaxrees> [2015:03:12:11:11:40] <robertmaxrees> you use your developer tools instead.
[11:12:18] <robertmaxrees> [2015:03:12:11:11:44] * aracodex_ (~aracodex1@58-7-97-112.dyn.iinet.net.au) Quit (Read error: No route to host)

[11:12:19] <robertmaxrees> woops.
[11:12:29] <robertmaxrees> paste that then.
[11:12:39] <robertmaxrees> becuase you should be able to target it it just fine.
[11:12:48] <robertmaxrees> it's an element like any other.
[11:13:34] <DragonPunch> i think this is a rather simple question
[11:13:40] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[11:13:44] <DragonPunch> Because it's dynamic content. You cant bind event likes the static  content, it's will not bind to the elements because they not appears at  the time you bind.
[11:13:46] <robertmaxrees> you interact with the element like any other.
[11:13:51] <robertmaxrees> right.
[11:14:04] <robertmaxrees> so if it's so simple, what aren't you understanding?
[11:14:12] <tasaif> http://badum.tiss.jpg.to
[11:14:43] <tasaif> this conversation would've been over an hour ago if you would just put it in a fiddle

[11:16:55] <DragonPunch> robertmaxrees: you failed to provide a concise answer to my question. of course i understand it now.
[11:17:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:17:11] <robertmaxrees> i didn't "fail" to do anything.
[11:17:25] <tasaif> > I need help

[11:19:22] <Cork> ya, same here
[11:19:43] <Cork> got the same shitty treatment from DragonPunch yesterday
[11:20:14] <Cork> and the same exact "punch line"
[11:21:17] <robertmaxrees> heh, anyway.
[11:22:54] <NoiseEee> DragonPunch -> /vampire.list
[11:23:06] <robertmaxrees> ^ this.

[11:23:54] <Bear10> does anyone know how to dismiss a bootstrap modal the same way they bring it in? toggle gives me a different animation than the one they use to bring it in
[11:24:45] <tasaif> Bear10: have you tried asking ##bootstrap ?
[11:24:55] <Bear10> ah i tried #bootstrap
[11:25:05] <robertmaxrees> what'd they tell you?
[11:25:14] <tasaif> dne probably
[11:25:19] <Bear10> tasaif: spot on
[11:25:29] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Haha. We should really keep that somewhere.
[11:25:31] <robertmaxrees> oooh i see now.
[11:26:17] <tasaif> how long is that list?
[11:26:27] <Cork> mine is ~15 ppl
[11:26:27] <robertmaxrees> longer and longer every day
[11:26:32] <Cork> true
[11:27:02] <BillCriswell> Cork: Oh you really keep one/ Awesome.
[11:27:34] <Cork> BillCriswell: ya, i used to have one integrated into the irc client so it marked the user and there text in light gray
[11:27:45] <Cork> to mark the line is uninteresting
[11:27:54] <BillCriswell> Haha
[11:27:55] <Cork> sadly.. haven't found a good way to do it outside of mirc :/
[11:28:13] <Cork> man i still miss mirc >_>
[11:28:54] <robertmaxrees> i love it, but i wish i could disable that dumb autocopy on click/drag bs
[11:29:18] <Cork> currently i use ignore instead, but it is not as good cause you miss the conversation, and that can be really bad
[11:29:31] <Cork> robertmaxrees: i think you can
[11:29:42] <Cork> though it was ~6 years since i used i last
[11:30:03] <Cork> (when i completely dropped windows)
[11:30:47] <robertmaxrees> i need to figure out lunch.
[11:31:07] <Cork> grab less complex food then :P

[11:48:56] <Robarelli> anyone using datatables editor? having issues using the bubble editor...when using a dropdown, the default value doesn't get selected
[11:49:40] <jim_j> hi
[11:50:22] <jim_j> I have a jQuery on copy event:  jQuery(document).on('copy', function(e) but I want to exclude copy of anything in a form field like an input box, how can I do that?
[11:52:20] <BillCriswell> jim_j: You can look at e.target and see if it's an input.
[11:53:44] <BillCriswell> jim_j: http://jsbin.com/qemabo/1/edit?html,js,output
[11:53:56] <jim_j> BillCriswell, thanks!  so:  if ( e.target.is( "input" ) )  ?
[11:54:25] <BillCriswell> jim_j: event.target is a regular element so you would need to do $(e.target).is(':input'); or something like that.
[11:54:40] <BillCriswell> :input would get like text areas and shit.
[11:54:59] <jim_j> thanks!
[11:55:11] <BillCriswell> No problem.

[12:04:15] <in_deep_thought> BillCriswell: chrome. thats the problem most of the time its fine and then sometimes it shows up
[12:04:39] <in_deep_thought> sometimes making the tables bigger (so that it has to get more elements) causes this
[12:04:54] <in_deep_thought> i think, it might just be coincidence though. could that cause this issue?
[12:05:20] <BillCriswell> in_deep_thought: I think you'd need to post a more complete example for us to have any idea what might occur.
[12:05:32] <in_deep_thought> I swear this is the example
[12:05:36] <in_deep_thought> its just inconsistent
[12:05:42] <in_deep_thought> can you at least explain what that error means?
[12:06:44] <BillCriswell> Too much recursion is how I think of it usually.
[12:08:05] <in_deep_thought> this is recursion. you mean too many cycles?
[12:08:40] <BillCriswell> Sure?
[12:08:57] <BillCriswell> I don't mean that rude I'm just bad with words.
[12:11:15] <tasaif> in_deep_thought: it never fails in the fiddle right?
[12:11:44] <in_deep_thought> no it does. Im trying to find a reliable way to replicate it
[12:12:19] <tasaif> does or doesn't?
[12:12:42] <DragonPunch> in_deep_thought: each browser has a hard coded stack size or memory exhaustion limit. when you exceed that limit it usually will give you that error. console.log in itself is a pretty expensive function.
[12:12:48] <in_deep_thought> does fail (sometimes). if it helps, the Uncaught range error has a drop down menu that lists the click_this command that it calls many times
[12:15:31] <DragonPunch> in_deep_thought: you can look at stack trace for a particular function or whole JS. you can also get this error when you import/embed the same JS file twice sometimes.
[12:26:59] <AlluringMe> Greetings!!!
[12:27:15] <AlluringMe> I wanted a bit of help with something
[12:27:22] <AlluringMe> I am working on
[12:28:17] <AlluringMe> How can I serialize the entire DOM to store to a DB
[12:28:31] <AlluringMe> I searched and found two answers
[12:28:31] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[12:28:38] <AlluringMe> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8914985/javascript-how-to-serialize-a-dom-element-as-a-string-to-be-used-later
[12:28:40] <robertmaxrees> that's an interesting problem.
[12:28:44] <robertmaxrees> why would you do that?
[12:28:44] <AlluringMe> http://jsfiddle.net/techbubble/pJgyu/7720/
[12:28:55] <AlluringMe> Let me try to explain
[12:29:31] <AlluringMe> I am coding a page where user gets to customize the interface
[12:29:53] <AlluringMe> He will also have textarea where he will be able to write notes
[12:30:17] <AlluringMe> So, when that user comes back, I want his styles, his text and everything else relevant loaded
[12:30:25] <AlluringMe> That's the idea.
[12:30:30] <robertmaxrees> storing all of that in a DB is not a good idea.
[12:30:44] <robertmaxrees> rather, storing the entirety of the document in a DB is not a good idea.
[12:30:54] <AlluringMe> Hmmm, I understand. It's offbeat
[12:31:03] <AlluringMe> any other ideas>
[12:31:06] <AlluringMe> *?
[12:31:06] <robertmaxrees> it's not just offbeat, it's inefficient.
[12:31:13] <robertmaxrees> i assume they're simply able to drag and drop things to predetermined spots?
[12:31:30] <AlluringMe> Not just that, they can do more
[12:31:40] <robertmaxrees> how much customization can they really do?
[12:31:46] <AlluringMe> For example .click function lets the user store text
[12:31:57] <AlluringMe> change the element style
[12:32:00] <AlluringMe> and so forth
[12:32:29] <robertmaxrees> that sounds more like storing small bits of customizations instead of the entire thing.
[12:32:30] <AlluringMe> plus the custom settings that apply to page
[12:32:56] <AlluringMe> What are my alternatives please
[12:33:11] <checkit> Hey guys... I'm having a little trouble with a dynamic form. Depending on a given selection a certain form is loaded onto the "stage". The problem is, I have several selectors set for input masking because, I believe, the newly create instance was not loaded into the DOM when the definitions on those selectors were set during page load. How can I correct this?
[12:33:16] <robertmaxrees> without seeing it, I'd say you need to just store a settings/customizations object for each user, AlluringMe
[12:33:17] <BillCriswell> in_deep_thought: It sounds like it's a plugin in Chrome that might be causing the issue then.
[12:33:32] <in_deep_thought> ill try it in other browsers, thanks BillCriswell
[12:33:39] <AlluringMe> That's lot of work for me haha
[12:33:52] <BillCriswell> in_deep_thought: Gfy in cognito in chrome (assuming no plugins run incognito(
[12:33:55] <robertmaxrees> AlluringMe programming is hard sometimes ;)
[12:33:59] <robertmaxrees> go with the right solution.
[12:34:13] <AlluringMe> I understand.
[12:34:14] <robertmaxrees> otherwise think about cases where there are redesigns and other tweaks outside of the end-user's control.
[12:34:20] <robertmaxrees> you'll end up with some massive headaches.
[12:34:38] <AlluringMe> Yes, I agree.
[12:34:40] <Wehgu> http://jsfiddle.net/k5z2uuha/
[12:35:07] <AlluringMe> I will just try working with individual elements. Thanks robertmaxrees
[12:35:20] <robertmaxrees> AlluringMe i'd still avoid storing markup in the DB if possible.
[12:35:35] <robertmaxrees> store things like the tagname and attributes for it.
[12:35:46] <AlluringMe> But
[12:35:58] <AlluringMe> Okay, I understand. That can be done
[12:35:59] <Wehgu> someone know if is ok the postData property
[12:39:21] <[Non]> how can i get current week dates ?
[12:39:25] <[Non]> i mean 7 days from now always
[12:40:01] <robertmaxrees> tons of google answers.
[12:40:11] <[Non]> oh robertmaxrees hi dude
[12:40:15] <[Non]> robertmaxre
[12:40:18] <[Non]> glad to find ypu
[12:40:28] <[Non]> i dont know if you ever remember but you did send to me a book
[12:40:31] <[Non]> about javascript
[12:40:44] <[Non]> that was free and there was a 2.version that was not free
[12:40:47] <robertmaxrees> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[12:40:52] <[Non]> do you remember that link? cuz i need it i lost :/
[12:41:29] <robertmaxrees> might have been eloquent javascript maybe?
[12:41:40] <[Non]> YES!
[12:41:43] <[Non]> eloquent yes!
[12:41:52] <[Non]> god damn
[12:41:55] <[Non]> (relieeef)
[12:47:56] <rubyonrailed> So I have this to code to add values and attributes to a hash. But I currently have a set of radio buttons, and it keeps grabbing the value of the last radio button in the set.  How can I make it grab the radio button that is selected?  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5767d1d5f24094a285f8
[12:48:06] <robertmaxrees> *object, not a hash
[12:48:30] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[12:48:57] <rubyonrailed> will do
[12:54:23] <rubyonrailed> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/upt1hL0b/  In the log, the value getting passed for the radios will always be the last one.
[12:55:48] <mwdev2> can anyone give me a hand quickly, i am trying to load a li a html page into a div on the current page. Just keeps opening new page right now http://jsfiddle.net/vyz4x4bv/1/
[12:56:42] <robertmaxrees> the last one what?
[12:56:50] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting that object to have in it?
[12:57:27] <robertmaxrees> rubyonrailed something here isn't adding up.
[12:58:02] <rubyonrailed> robertmaxrees: Under "Program Type" if you select "SW" The object has the value of "N/A". The last radio button in the group.
[12:58:18] <robertmaxrees> oooooh.
[12:59:20] <robertmaxrees> so as an aside custom attributes are a general no-no, and iirc autosave isn't a valid attr name.  in this case, it's doing exactly what you're telling it to do :)
[12:59:43] <robertmaxrees> you should probably enumerate over the TDs and find the selected option instead.
[13:00:05] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find("[autosave = true]").each() is what's causing your problem.
[13:00:19] <rubyonrailed> I see
[13:00:23] <rubyonrailed> now
[13:06:01] <rubyonrailed> robertmaxrees: Thanks for pointing that out to me
[13:06:12] <checkit> Hey guys... I'm having a little trouble with a dynamic form. Depending on a given selection a certain form is loaded onto the "stage". The problem is, I have several selectors set for input masking because, I believe, the newly create instance was not loaded into the DOM when the definitions on those selectors were set during page load. How can I correct this?
[13:06:26] <robertmaxrees> checkit correct what?
[13:07:00] <checkit> Predefined selectors don't work when I dynamically add elements to a page.
[13:07:07] <robertmaxrees> there's no way to fix that.
[13:07:17] <robertmaxrees> you have to select after elements are added to the page.
[13:07:45] <checkit> What if they do "already" exist on the page but are hidden and loaded into my "stage"?
[13:07:54] <robertmaxrees> then those selectors will work.
[13:08:23] <robertmaxrees> they won't work if you do things like clone them or something like that.
[13:08:38] <checkit> Right. Okay... So what is a work around for that?
[13:08:47] <robertmaxrees> select things after you put them into the page.
[13:09:05] <robertmaxrees> you cannot select things that don't yet exist.  there's no way around it really.
[13:10:32] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Consider this: https://gist.github.com/mrjonleek/226609245bfe45f9f9ce essentially <tr>'s are added to a table and clicking the X for instance does work
[13:10:41] <checkit> I can't get it to work like that for masking input.
[13:10:56] <robertmaxrees> you're convoluting things.
[13:11:09] <checkit> Yes
[13:11:11] <robertmaxrees> this event listener works because you're binding to document.  that object exists forever.
[13:11:16] <robertmaxrees> it's there.  nothing changes with it.
[13:11:27] <robertmaxrees> the masking plugin needs the elements to exist for it to work its magic.
[13:11:32] <robertmaxrees> there's no "delegated" version of that.
[13:12:08] <checkit> I see. Okay. So in the same function I'm using to construct the form (pull hidden elements to the stage) I need to set the selector for the input to masked after the element has been rendered.
[13:12:15] <checkit> ?^
[13:12:21] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:14:22] <checkit> Nice. Finally got it working. Thanks robertmaxrees!
[13:14:30] <robertmaxrees> fsho!
[13:14:37] <robertmaxrees> it was all you mano :)
[13:15:42] <xibalba> hi, i could use a little help with this gist of code. https://gist.github.com/RezaAmbler/b0dbba4992a9a962b889#file-review-html-L6 . On line 6, when that button is clicked I want to call the code starting on Line 8. It doesn't work when clicked, though it calls that analytics.track() method when the page loads.
[13:16:11] <xibalba> any help is appreciated
[13:16:12] <robertmaxrees> xibalba you can't use .on() like that.
[13:16:45] <robertmaxrees> it expects a function object - you're running the function on load and assigning the return to the .on().  you have two options.
[13:18:43] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/fg5l6fi/ both options are in here.
[13:19:07] <xibalba> ooooh
[13:19:10] <xibalba> thank you very much robertmaxrees
[13:19:24] <xibalba> i think the first option is easier on the eyes
[13:19:43] <robertmaxrees> i do, too :)
[13:19:57] <robertmaxrees> helps make things more modular.
[13:22:23] <xibalba> great it didn't blast all reviews into the tracking application on page load
[13:23:37] <xibalba> damn JS syntax is hard for me to read
[13:23:56] <robertmaxrees> oh?
[13:25:36] <xibalba> im just not use to it yet
[13:25:44] <robertmaxrees> you'll get there :)
[13:25:44] <xibalba> just started rereading on the topic, last time it was 10 years ago
[13:26:00] <DragonPunch> Can I do a jQuery AJAX with sub-domains or is that against the same origin policy?
[13:26:46] <robertmaxrees> that'd be cross-domain if you're not on the same subdomain.
[13:26:52] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you can set up CORS on domains if you want.
[13:27:05] <robertmaxrees> so you can do cross-domain.
[13:28:28] <Prometheian> My ajax callback seems to be firing, but it doesn't seem to be in the correct order. Is there some glaring part of JS I've managed to screw up? http://www.hastebin.com/cixojisozo.coffee
[13:29:52] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian what order do they need to run in?
[13:30:07] <xibalba> robertmaxrees, so while it doesn't trigger every single one on page load now. it doesn't seem to work when i click on it. http://fixee.org/paste/zanxtrk/
[13:30:25] <robertmaxrees> <a id="#review-29" isn't valid.
[13:30:26] <xibalba> i'm wondering does it have to do with the anchor being around the button that calss another data-target of the same name?
[13:30:28] <robertmaxrees> <a id="review-29" is
[13:30:32] <xibalba> oh
[13:30:34] <xibalba> doh
[13:30:36] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:30:51] <Prometheian> I need it to do the setupCookieLibrarySettings last, robert
[13:31:09] <Prometheian> json.js and cookie.js can go in either order
[13:31:36] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing getJSONLibrary(getCookieLibrary(setupCookieLibrarySettings)); is the broken one?
[13:32:04] <Prometheian> Yes
[13:32:07] <robertmaxrees> because the way that code works is it'll execute getCookieLibrary, then setupCookieLibrarySesstings, then getJSONLibrary
[13:32:09] <BillCriswell> http://updates.html5rocks.com/2015/03/increasing-engagement-with-app-install-banners-in-chrome-for-android fuck yeaahhhh
[13:32:16] <Prometheian> Oh... shit
[13:32:23] <robertmaxrees> because getCookieLibrary(setupCookieLibrarySettings) is just running it ;)
[13:32:27] <robertmaxrees> use deferreds here :D
[13:33:55] <robertmaxrees> that'll give you exactly what you want.
[13:34:23] <Prometheian> .success you mean?
[13:34:27] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:34:38] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[13:35:37] <robertmaxrees> you can also ditch your do "need" vars, too.
[13:35:47] <DragonPunch> robertmaxrees: Alright.
[13:37:12] <Vukan> hello, need some help with this short code http://pastebin.com/uHDMdQP4
[13:37:28] <Prometheian> need vars are for 'readability'
[13:37:35] <Vukan> line 10 works but line 9 doesn't. why??
[13:37:49] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian the deferreds will take care of all of that for you :)
[13:37:59] <Prometheian> kk, I'll check it out!
[13:38:04] <robertmaxrees> Vukan what about it doesn't work?
[13:38:17] <robertmaxrees> and please don't say "it doesn't run".
[13:38:41] <Vukan> robertmaxrees: it doesn't remove this hidden attribute from the class
[13:39:07] <robertmaxrees> Vukan and you put console.log($('#le-alert').length) before it to make sure it's finding it?
[13:39:32] <Vukan> hm, no
[13:39:34] <robertmaxrees> you also made sure that ID isn't duplicated on that page?
[13:39:43] <robertmaxrees> $('[id="le-alert
[13:39:53] <Vukan> i'm a begginer with JS. let me try this
[13:39:55] <robertmaxrees> * $('[id="le-alert"]').length to triple check.
[13:40:07] <Vukan> one thing more.
[13:40:23] <Vukan> this fires bootstrap alert div
[13:40:42] <Vukan> when datepicker field is selected
[13:40:55] <Vukan> and it works only first time i select the date
[13:41:35] <Vukan> next time it doesn't not show that bootstrap alert div
[13:41:53] <Vukan> but it does show alert from line 10
[13:41:58] <Vukan> every time
[13:42:26] <robertmaxrees> i'm not clear on what's broken.
[13:42:48] <AlluringMe> robertmaxrees
[13:43:09] <robertmaxrees> that's my name.
[13:43:14] <AlluringMe> haha hi
[13:43:29] <AlluringMe> Can you please look at something
[13:43:31] <AlluringMe> thanks
[13:43:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:43:52] <AlluringMe> I mean code I wanted to ask something.
[13:43:59] <AlluringMe> I need help
[13:44:08] <robertmaxrees> if you have a question, just ask it.
[13:44:13] <robertmaxrees> don't ask to ask.
[13:44:19] <AlluringMe> first, how do I share jfiddle code lol
[13:44:29] <AlluringMe> thanks
[13:44:31] <AlluringMe> I will
[13:44:33] <robertmaxrees> hit "save" and then copy the url and paste into here.
[13:44:39] <AlluringMe> ok sec
[13:44:47] <robertmaxrees> or hit "update" and copy/paste the URL.
[13:44:57] <Vukan> robertmaxrees: console.log($('#le-alert').length) shows up in console
[13:45:04] <robertmaxrees> and what does it give you?
[13:45:04] <AlluringMe> http://jsfiddle.net/ju3x167q/
[13:45:08] <Vukan> 1
[13:45:10] <AlluringMe> Wgat I am trying to do now is
[13:45:14] <AlluringMe> What*
[13:45:24] <AlluringMe> manipulate the dialog
[13:45:28] <AlluringMe> based on selection
[13:45:37] <robertmaxrees> Vukan try the other one - console.log($('[id="#le-alert"]').length);
[13:45:41] <AlluringMe> but it does not seem to work when I dynamically generate the content
[13:45:49] <AlluringMe> it works fine with static content
[13:46:18] <robertmaxrees> AlluringMe you need event delegation - you can't bind listeners to things that don't yet exist.
[13:46:25] <Vukan> this one gives me 0
[13:46:27] <Vukan> ??
[13:46:30] <AlluringMe> how do I do that please
[13:46:38] <robertmaxrees> Vukan - console.log($('[id="le-alert"]').length); sorry
[13:46:47] <robertmaxrees> AlluringMe also, don't use an ID for the modal body.
[13:47:09] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events AlluringMe read this.
[13:47:17] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ is another great resource.
[13:47:26] <AlluringMe> Okay thanks checking it
[13:47:26] <Vukan> robertmaxrees: this one gives 1 also
[13:47:27] <robertmaxrees> Vukan is is possible for you to make a fiddle?
[13:47:28] <AlluringMe> :D
[13:48:01] <Vukan> it's very much mixed with php framework code
[13:48:04] <trappar> I have two scripts which operate completely independently (separate copies of jQuery even), one is triggering a custom event, and for debugging purposes catching it. The other script is supposed to be catching it the same way. The triggering script catches it fine, but the non-triggering won't. In chrome I can see that the element has two event listeners which are identical. Anyone know why this might be?
[13:48:18] <robertmaxrees> Vukan then it's almost impossible to help. sorry.
[13:48:29] <Vukan> okay
[13:48:31] <cjohnson> trappar: code?
[13:48:35] <Vukan> robertmaxrees: thanks anyway
[13:48:50] <Vukan> any suggestion what to look for?
[13:48:57] <cjohnson> trappar: are they running on the same page? or is one running in a userscript/extension for instance
[13:49:06] <robertmaxrees> Vukan sounds like you have some issues with event bindings.
[13:49:33] <trappar> cjohnson: It's a bit complex since this is bundled code using webpack. One part is an embeddable javascript widget and the other is a page for configuring the widget. Both pieces of code are coming from the server - not userscript/extension.
[13:50:15] <trappar> cjohnson: I'd do a jsfiddle or something but considering the situation I don't think it's even possible to replicate there.
[13:50:36] <cjohnson> well ultimately you're just talking about 2 bits of code running on the same page right
[13:50:44] <trappar> Yep
[13:50:48] <cjohnson> boil the fiddle down to those 2 bits of code
[13:50:51] <cjohnson> make a reduced test case
[13:50:51] <Vukan> robertmaxrees: it bothers me that it works when i'm selecting date for the first time. but if i select new date on the same field than it doesnt trigger the code form the line 9
[13:51:08] <robertmaxrees> Vukan dunno how to help you man.
[13:51:16] <robertmaxrees> maybe try reading http://fixingthesejquery.com/ ?
[13:51:19] <Vukan> no problem ;)
[13:51:34] <tasaif> trappar: could you access the data supply and connect him up to the matrix?
[13:51:35] <cjohnson> it can't be that complicated if you're just talking about binding an event handler to a dom node and then triggering that event later
[13:51:49] <cjohnson> even if you can't get it working at least post the relevant bits to look at
[13:51:55] <trappar> tasaif: huh?
[13:52:04] <trappar> cjohnson: Yeah, one sec - working on it.
[13:52:09] <tasaif> opengl, ram swapping, the internet
[13:53:32] <tasaif> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg29TuWo0Yo
[13:53:40] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[13:54:43] <trappar> cjohnson: This is pretty much it. Ultra simple. https://jsfiddle.net/mx0tcu2e/2/
[13:55:13] <cjohnson> and they're both included right on the page right? no userscripts or anything like that
[13:55:29] <trappar> Correct
[13:55:33] <cjohnson> can you reproduce how you have your separate jquery copies set up here?
[13:55:42] <trappar> I don't think so
[13:55:52] <cjohnson> well how do you load the 2 copies?
[13:56:08] <trappar> They are packed into bundles with Webpack
[13:56:25] <trappar> So essentially they are both namespaced away from each other in anonymous functions
[13:56:31] <cjohnson> well how does webpack do it? can you look at its output?
[13:56:36] <cjohnson> thats what I mean
[13:56:56] <cjohnson> is it a modified jquery? jquery doesn't normally work nicely with module systems
[13:57:11] <trappar> It's unmodified
[13:58:01] <trappar> jQuery seems to be working fine so far. We have lots of code running on this system. Webpack supports AMD and CommonJS. I think jQuery supports the same via UMD.
[13:58:29] <cjohnson> unless its changed recently, jquery out of the box still works with the "globals" approach, not through a module
[13:58:53] <cjohnson> the reason I'm suggesting the 2 jqueries being an issue is that I'm not sure if custom events run through the DOM
[13:59:12] <cjohnson> if it uses an internal mapping, each jquery may be using a different mapping for events
[13:59:34] <cjohnson> I know for instance I've had issues using jquery talking from a userscript to a web page for that same reason
[13:59:36] <trappar> I'm guessing that is indeed the issue
[13:59:48] <cjohnson> I could trigger DOM events to go both ways but not for instance .data() calls
[14:00:22] <trappar> So perhaps if I use raw javascript events rather than jquery's event implementation it would work..
[14:01:50] <cjohnson> Maybe, worth giving a try
[14:01:57] <cjohnson> easy to test anyway
[14:13:09] <tasaif> is image rendering compatibility browser specific or is it part of a standard?
[14:26:05] <DragonPunch> jQuery AJAX recursively. Any thoughts on such implementation?
[14:26:51] <Omar-> hi
[14:32:31] <NoiseEee> DragonPunch: "promises / deferreds"
[14:35:26] <jfive> hello
[14:36:03] <jfive> if i am in a function like: $(document).on('click',function() { ... }); how could i figure out what element the user clicked to trigger the click event?
[14:36:43] <jfive> doing a console.log for $(this) just shows me #document
[14:37:22] <DragonPunch> jfive: Well, you're telling it $(document)
[14:37:28] <DragonPunch> So it's going return you #document
[14:37:42] <jfive> DragonPunch: correct, i realize that (hence my question, hehe)
[14:38:10] <DragonPunch> You need to be a little bit more specific with jQuery. It's not very smart.
[14:38:37] <DragonPunch> jfive: Say if you want the first child you would say $this.children();
[14:38:46] <DragonPunch> jfive: You kind of have to tell it what you want a little bit more.
[14:39:58] <jfive> well i am trying to close a flyout menu when the user clicks outside of the menu, but i'd like to set up some exceptions to the rule (so to speak)
[14:40:15] <DragonPunch> jfive: what you could do is find the position of where the user clicked on the page. Than find what's the closest element to that click.
[14:41:54] <jfive> perhaps i could do soemthing like $(document).not('.someclass')
[14:42:21] <DragonPunch> jfive: Well if you want to do that, you would define the area and the position that the flyout menu would appear in. Than you just say if I click somewhere outside that position make the flyout menu disappear. (I'm sorry if this is not very jQuery-ish. I'm more accustomed to writing organic Javascript)
[14:43:44] <jfive> hmm yeah the specific size of the flyout menu could change (this is a wordpress site and the "flyout menu" in this case is a bootstrap main menu navigation)
[14:47:10] <DragonPunch> jfive: you should just use a modal.
[14:47:52] <DragonPunch> jfive: they automatically do kind of what you're saying. i'm not too sure of the details. but, if you're making something novel, I would suggest using the method that I told you which requires math and the use of functions.
[14:48:10] <DragonPunch> jfive: and a little bit more work. ;)
[14:48:23] <robertmaxrees> you can check the event object fwiw.
[14:48:59] <robertmaxrees> $(document).on('click', function(e) { $(e.target) }); and all that.
[14:56:43] <cjohnson> the element the event was triggered on is "this"
[14:57:36] <robertmaxrees> except that $(document).on('click', function() {});, that isn't very helpful if what you want is where the click event "came" from.
[14:57:51] <cjohnson> are there cases where e.target != this?
[14:58:02] <tirengarfio> is it posible to know if the bottom of an element has reached a vertical position?
[14:58:27] <tirengarfio> when scrolling a fixed element I mean
[14:58:27] <cjohnson> you can get the element's offset plus its height
[14:58:35] <cjohnson> using .offset and .height
[14:58:39] <cjohnson> in the scroll event
[14:59:00] <robertmaxrees> cjohnson http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/syx7yacL/
[14:59:17] <cjohnson> ooooh I see
[14:59:31] <cjohnson> so this is the bound element not necessarily the one that triggered the event
[14:59:41] <cjohnson> neat
[14:59:56] <robertmaxrees> unless it's a delegated listener, in which case it's the second arg to the listener.
[15:00:07] <cjohnson> I never use bubbled events like that are they very common?
[15:00:15] <cjohnson> seems like delegated events cover everything I'd need
[15:00:23] <robertmaxrees> that technically IS a delegated listener ;)
[15:00:24] <tasaif> cjohnson: dynamic content
[15:00:35] <tasaif> if you don't want to rebind events on new objects
[15:00:41] <robertmaxrees> tasaif they mean vs $(document).on('click', 'a', function(){});
[15:01:02] <tasaif> right
[15:01:04] <robertmaxrees> $(document).on('click', function(e) {}); can be used similarly.
[15:01:13] <robertmaxrees> but it's not very common.
[15:01:20] <cjohnson> well sure but still. I never do $(parent).on('event'... unless I also include a selector as the second arg
[15:01:26] <cjohnson> was just wondering if that was uncommon
[15:01:33] <robertmaxrees> yeah it is.
[15:01:43] <robertmaxrees> explicitly using the delegated syntax is cleaner imo.
[15:02:44] <DragonPunch> jQuery AJAX is returning an object on success, how do you convert that into a text response if all that is being sent from the endpoint is 'hell yeah'?
[15:03:07] <tasaif> have you checked the object responseText ?
[15:03:09] <robertmaxrees> it already is text if that's all that's coming back.
[15:04:59] <DragonPunch> My server is just: res.send('hell yeah');
[15:05:08] <nitrospectide> is this syntax wrong? <script>jQuery("form.webform-client-form").css("background-color:#ff0000;");</script>
[15:05:20] <DragonPunch> tasaif: I just checked object.ResponseText; in an alert and there was no string.
[15:05:21] <robertmaxrees> nitrospectide yep - .css() takes two args.
[15:05:21] <cjohnson> if you don't have a dataType: 'json' jquery won't convert anything and it just gives you the string response
[15:05:38] <DragonPunch> cjohnson: dataType should be plain old html.
[15:05:40] <robertmaxrees> DragonPunch console.log(object); - whatdo you get?
[15:06:02] <robertmaxrees> nitrospectide that should be .css('background-color', '#ff0000');
[15:06:03] <cjohnson> DragonPunch: if that's what you put sure. what code are you using for the ajax request?
[15:07:09] <DragonPunch> http://hastebin.com/ejecoligep.hs
[15:07:12] <DragonPunch> yall can ping it.
[15:08:23] <cjohnson> try dataType: 'text'
[15:08:44] <DragonPunch> [object Object]
[15:09:17] <nitrospectide> robertmaxrees: And as long as I wrap that in <script>, I should be able to drop it into the middle of some markup?
[15:09:23] <tasaif> DragonPunch: http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/m8stfwxL/
[15:09:28] <tasaif> I get a security error
[15:09:34] <tasaif> maybe that's related?
[15:09:52] <DragonPunch> I get [object Object]
[15:09:59] <robertmaxrees> right, because it fails.
[15:10:07] <robertmaxrees> it's not successfully finishing the request.
[15:10:30] <robertmaxrees> it is erroring out, in other words.
[15:10:33] <DragonPunch> mmm. I think it's because I'm doing the request from localhost and not scribear.com so the Same Origin Policy is getting in the way.
[15:10:51] <robertmaxrees> it's not reporting a CORS issue.
[15:11:00] <tasaif> cross domain security
[15:11:07] <robertmaxrees> the response from the other server is successfully completing.
[15:11:09] <tasaif> we need bigger walls
[15:11:10] <robertmaxrees> it's just empty.
[15:11:29] <tasaif> all responses must present their identification papers
[15:11:51] <abailarri> Anyone knows a way for have a full screen image with a menu in the bottom?
[15:11:51] <DragonPunch> Well, it's using complete: which will trigger whether it succeeds or not. If you use success: it does it on success. complete: does it on either.
[15:12:02] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:12:05] <tasaif> All responses without 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' must where a special armband
[15:12:05] <robertmaxrees> well aware.
[15:12:13] <robertmaxrees> so it's failing.
[15:12:16] <cjohnson> I don't see the right header from your server
[15:12:26] <tasaif> s/where/wear/
[15:13:26] <tasaif> DragonPunch: do you control the server?
[15:13:41] <DragonPunch> Yes, I wrote them all.
[15:13:48] <robertmaxrees> you might need to enable CORS, though that might not be the right thing to do in your case.
[15:13:57] <tasaif> What type of server is it?
[15:14:01] <robertmaxrees> i'd use your network panel in your dev tools to check to see what's going on.
[15:14:42] <tasaif> thise needs to be somewhere
[15:14:42] <tasaif> header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *");
[15:14:45] <DragonPunch> NodeJS, setting header right now. To see if that's the issue.
[15:14:55] <tasaif> (that was for php)
[15:14:59] <robertmaxrees> not for everything fwiw
[15:15:05] <robertmaxrees> don't just set that and not think about it.
[15:15:20] <tasaif> at the very least it'll help identify the issue
[15:15:27] <robertmaxrees> sure, temporarily.
[15:15:48] <robertmaxrees> but suggesting people just enable CORS without helping them understand the ramifications of doing that is a little funky ;)
[15:15:49] <DragonPunch> header should be set now.
[15:16:02] <robertmaxrees> so test :)
[15:16:22] <tasaif> "f*** yeah"
[15:16:25] <DragonPunch> [object Object]
[15:16:31] <tasaif> data.responseText
[15:16:33] <robertmaxrees> use success instead of complete fwiw
[15:16:38] <DragonPunch> tasaif: okay, you got it.
[15:16:58] <robertmaxrees> or .done()
[15:17:16] <DragonPunch> Good job team.

[16:07:53] <mwdev2> wait woops
[16:07:59] <robertmaxrees> and JS ;)
[16:08:19] <mwdev2> that was wrong thing i copy pasted. no one had nswered my earlier questions and went back for wrong one

[16:09:22] <mwdev2> i think im retarded
[16:09:27] <mwdev2> lol
[16:09:29] <robertmaxrees> i already showed you what you need.
[16:10:02] <tasaif> step 1 is make things not an eyestore
[16:10:03] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/vyz4x4bv/3/

[16:11:19] <tasaif> oh, you're talking about his js?
[16:11:21] <mwdev2> awesome thanks, yeah when i copy pasted it from my code editor it was all messed
[16:11:28] <robertmaxrees> that too.
[16:11:50] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/vyz4x4bv/4/
[16:11:58] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:12:01] <robertmaxrees> i already did that.
[16:12:03] <robertmaxrees> i am not invisible.
[16:12:16] <robertmaxrees> oph you mean the markup.  w/e
[16:12:19] <tasaif> :p
[16:12:22] <mwdev2> why was the prevent default needed? is that something for href? i was reqriting all my code from the other day and was trying to work it from that code
[16:12:30] <tasaif> consolidation
[16:12:40] <robertmaxrees> mwdev2 you need it so the browser doesn't follow the clicked link.
[16:12:43] <tasaif> sorry that was not an answer, but a comment
[16:14:07] <mwdev2> robertmaxrees, ahhh thanks for the heads up
[16:22:39] <destinydriven> hey guys I have an issue. I'm trying to call function based on whether a PHP variable passed to returns bool true.  The same code that previously worked on a button click now doesn't run when called like this: http://pastebin.com/Y6rhp0H1
[16:23:04] <destinydriven> ignore line 29
[16:23:16] <robertmaxrees> try console.log(jsVars); first thing in that doc ready.
[16:23:28] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[16:23:33] <destinydriven> I get true
[16:24:02] <robertmaxrees> then if(jsVars.noHourlyRate === true){ et al won't work.
[16:24:05] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make any sense.
[16:24:07] <destinydriven> well  . . noHourlyRate = true
[16:24:13] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:24:32] <robertmaxrees> you need to use something to output JSON for you.
[16:24:46] <destinydriven> robertmaxrees, sorry, what I mean is that this section of code is being called
[16:24:46] <robertmaxrees> unless .$this->Js->object($jsVars) does that.
[16:25:18] <destinydriven> robertmaxrees, the jsVar is being set. I tested it with console.log(jsVars)
[16:25:31] <robertmaxrees> okay.  then what's the actual problem?
[16:26:11] <destinydriven> my probem is that I modified a function which was previously triggered by a click event
[16:26:28] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[16:26:41] <destinydriven> as can be seen in the code at bottom, only change I made was to try to trigger it based on jsVar
[16:27:10] <destinydriven> only error I get is a GET error for a sound file
[16:27:23] <robertmaxrees> can you setup a fiddle with the rendered HTML?
[16:27:27] <robertmaxrees> something here isn't adding up.
[16:27:28] <destinydriven> but that's just a path error
[16:27:42] <destinydriven> robertmaxrees, sure
[16:28:48] <robertmaxrees> and just include the function/s you're having problems with.
[16:31:32] <destinydriven> ok, I'm on it
[16:43:31] <destinydriven> robertmaxrees, http://jsfiddle.net/Lfjo8yxh/2/
[16:43:43] <destinydriven> I tried my best to replicate this
[16:44:30] <destinydriven> essentially, when button is clicked, notification shows up.    Same thing should happen on page load when noHourlyRate = true
[16:49:34] <destinydriven> robertmaxrees, here is a better version http://jsfiddle.net/Lfjo8yxh/7/
[16:50:03] <thomasreggi> Sorry to just jump into the convo like this. I'm having a bit of trouble. For some reason when I select something thats not in the DOM I get back null instead of an empty array.
[16:56:02] <destinydriven> robertmaxrees, see it works fine in the fiddle. But not on my live page
[16:56:30] <royalty> i have content bubbling in with ajax, how do i make it so that the content comes in smoothly
[16:56:33] <royalty> rather than just jumps in
[16:56:47] <royalty> i tried a css3 height transition but it doesn't seem to be working
[16:58:24] <decx> depends if you replace an area or add to a collection of items
[16:59:15] <royalty> decx, replace an area
[16:59:40] <royalty> code is pretty much replaceWith(newdatahere)
[17:00:22] <decx> overlay the old content with a container that starts at opacity 0 and position absolute and fade it in
[17:00:56] <royalty> thing is I have a spinner, you know that loading bar thing
[17:01:02] <royalty> which is in the middle
[17:01:12] <royalty> not sure if i should just remove it
[17:01:17] <decx> if you already have a spinner just replace the content
[17:01:28] <royalty> i already am but i just want the content to bounce in smooth
[17:01:30] <royalty> if possible
[17:01:51] <royalty> meh i might just skip this task
[17:02:05] <royalty> but i dunno i think it would b good practice for my ui skills
[17:02:22] <decx> your spinner is already a good enough ux element to signify an impending change in content
[17:02:29] <royalty> yeah true
[17:02:44] <decx> animating the content would be an alternative to that
[17:02:57] <royalty> yeah i'll stick with the spinner
[17:02:57] <decx> having both is just a waste imho
[17:03:11] <decx> and animating content in has to be super subtle
[17:03:16] <royalty> but they do want a way to close and open the existing content, that should be easy though
[17:03:19] <decx> to not get overbearing
[17:03:36] <royalty> decx, that makes sense, thanks yo
[17:04:10] <destinydriven> robertmaxrees, I have to head out now. Thanks for your time and assistance
[17:04:29] <destinydriven> Might be back in an hour or two
[17:10:22] <abailarri> Hello. I'm trying to create a mobile menu dinamically but I not get results. Any help please? https://jsfiddle.net/d6t6go68/1/
[17:12:21] <decx> it does what it says it does?!
[17:16:28] <abailarri> decx, do you tell to me?
[17:17:05] <decx> i have an imaginary friend, duuh
[17:17:56] <garethdaine> Folks, anyone know how to stop form.serialize() from caching?
[17:18:49] <decx> you want a live serialize?
[17:19:14] <garethdaine> I have a multipart form that users can remove and add elements too on a button click, the form is then submitted via .ajax using serialize(). but it an element is removed from the form and then submitted again, the old data is still being sent
[17:24:30] <garethdaine> Any ideas?
[17:25:17] <tasaif> can you put it in a fiddle?
[17:25:48] <tasaif> http://give.a.little.whistle.jpg.to/
[17:26:05] <decx> can't confirm
[17:26:52] <wast> how to get inv to #php ?
[17:29:59] <Woet> wast: it's ##php
[17:30:54] <tasaif> garethdaine: http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/fnpunnvv/2/
[17:30:56] <tasaif> works for me
[17:31:53] <garethdaine> tasif: This is my code mate http://kopy.io/WdyDD
[17:32:04] <garethdaine> tasaif ^^
[17:32:49] <garethdaine> Basically, users can add and remove form fields. Adding works fine, it’s when they’re removed that they still remain as part of the serialized form query string
[17:33:08] <tasaif> upon further inspection, the fiddle I sent you does not match your case
[17:33:10] <garethdaine> Do you think it might be because the .summary button is within the form itself?
[17:33:12] <tasaif> however this one does
[17:33:12] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/fnpunnvv/3/
[17:34:30] <tasaif> just noticed your new messages
[17:34:35] <tasaif> no, I don't think so
[17:35:25] <tasaif> I don't get it, where's the part where you're removing or adding stuff?
[17:35:40] <garethdaine> Well, I’m doing what you essentially do in your fiddle, the elements are being removed via a button click. They don’t exist when removed in the bookingForm var but serialize() remembers the data
[17:35:56] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/fnpunnvv/4/ works here too
[17:36:06] <garethdaine> http://kopy.io/CKN3P
[17:36:08] <decx> when removing and adding inputs of the same name with different val
[17:36:16] <garethdaine> Sorry ignore that
[17:36:46] <tasaif> maybe you have a stale reference to the form somehow
[17:37:20] <garethdaine> This is what’s removing the delegates array http://kopy.io/5SIxu
[17:37:45] <garethdaine> And it does indeed remove the element from the DOM
[17:39:03] <tasaif> (if the parent has a class on it, you can do .closest('.grand-parents-name')
[17:39:28] <tasaif> s/the parent/the grandparent/
[17:40:15] <garethdaine> Yeah, sure but it works for the moment. Thanks though.
[17:40:45] <garethdaine> If I console.log(bookingForm) the delegates array is gone
[17:41:04] <tasaif> can you recreate the problem in a fiddle so I can tinker with it?
[17:41:10] <garethdaine> but when I use serialize() directly after the assignment in the ajax request it’s in the string
[17:43:09] <hanek> Hey. I have a container and several different content divs that i need to swap based on what is clicked on a navigation without a page refresh. What would be the easiest way to do so?
[17:44:00] <tasaif> swap their contents
[17:44:14] <garethdaine> tasaif: Wouldn’t know where to begin to do a fiddle with this mate unfortunately
[17:44:41] <tasaif> ok
[17:45:27] <tasaif> what if you put: console.log($('#booking-form').serialize()) right before $.ajax
[17:45:44] <tasaif> is the unwanted data there?
[17:46:42] <tasaif> and what happens if you replace
[17:46:42] <tasaif> data: bookingForm.serialize(),
[17:46:43] <tasaif> with
[17:46:51] <tasaif> data: $('#booking-form').serialize()
[17:46:54] <tasaif> ,
[17:47:25] <tasaif> wait...
[17:47:50] <tasaif> it's not being cached
[17:48:26] <tasaif> could it be that you have a race condition and the ajax is being called before you remove the node
[17:48:30] <tasaif> ?
[17:49:45] <garethdaine> No becuase the button to remove the delegates array (or an item in it) is on a previous step of the multi form, the summary button is on that step, so you can only ever remove before submitting
[17:49:49] <garethdaine> Let me try your solution
[17:53:45] <garethdaine> Same scenario tasaif
[18:08:40] <tasaif> hanek: http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/s5g5uc5p/3/
[18:09:35] <hanek> tasaif: what's that? Not really what I was asking....
[18:10:01] <tasaif> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[18:10:47] <hanek> I just have a simple site and a container. Whenever I press on main in nav it should show only div #main, when I press on about in nav it should show #about
[18:10:53] <hanek> without any page refreshes
[18:11:37] <tasaif> you don't want to swap contents
[18:11:48] <hanek> I tried kook-swap plugin (http://kool-swap.joschaschmidt.de/demo/) and grabbing the ids from a separate html which had all the divs but it wasn't able to apply the default stylesheet to the loaded content
[18:12:15] <hanek> I don't?
[18:15:08] <tasaif> you want to ajax every time you visit a different nav item?
[18:15:34] <hanek> Yeah
[18:17:04] <hanek> So to put this more simple. I am working on foundation grid. I have 4 nav items (home,about,gallery,contact). Then I have a empty container and 4 divs that should go in the container when the respective nav item is clicked.
[18:22:14] <hanek> tasaif: whats the most reasonable solution for this?
[18:22:45] <tasaif> Well, personally, I wouldn't ajax different tabs of a page
[18:25:25] <hanek> How would you approach it then?
[18:26:00] <tasaif> I think I would aim for loading all of the tabs at once (assuming that weren't too much of a burden) in different containers
[18:26:12] <tasaif> then I would move between the containers
[18:27:42] <hanek>  you mean having them positioned out of the main container and then just pushing their position?
[18:28:38] <tasaif> Sure, if you wanted to do a sliding type of ui
[18:29:10] <tasaif> or you could hide a div and show the other div if you didn't care (although the abruptness might be jarring)
[18:29:17] <tasaif> or you could fade them in and out of view
[18:29:31] <tasaif> point being, I wouldn't want to put the load time in between tab navigations
[18:30:29] <hanek> So in a nutshell, if i click on about, it adds visible class to #about and display:none to all of the other divs, right?
[18:31:55] <tasaif> yea, why not?
[18:32:11] <tasaif> there's probably a library that does it for you though
[18:32:56] <hanek> Great, thanks! I'll look for it. Any suggestions?
[18:33:15] <tasaif> looks like you can use jquery tabs to do tabs
[18:33:22] <tasaif> I believe bootstrap also has it for you
[18:33:40] <tasaif> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tabs
[18:33:41] <hanek> I'm doing it in foundation
[18:33:53] <tasaif> you don't have to use the rest of bootstrap
[18:34:04] <tasaif> you can cherry pick what you want
[18:34:12] <hanek> Oh - foundation has it too!
[18:34:29] <hanek> Awesome, thanks for this!
[18:34:33] <hanek> ;)

[19:12:22] <R13ose> If I have a two divs on the same page that I want to scroll in from left and right, how do I do that?  Code: http://pastebin.com/22aQB541 I am using at the moment which is not moving either of the divs.
[19:20:55] <tasaif> R13ose: css man
[19:21:56] <R13ose> tasaif: the way I am doing this is wrong?
[19:22:09] <tasaif> it's not wrong, it's reinventing the wheel
[19:22:14] <R13ose> Ok
[19:22:25] <AoiC> I think css3 animations are not supported by older browsers though, are they?
[19:22:52] <tasaif> refer to http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-transitions for compatibility
[19:29:15] <tasaif> R13ose: something like this
[19:29:15] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/n0ht4m3s/2/
[19:29:31] <tasaif> there are problems with my code but you should be able to scavenge something from it
[19:29:47] <R13ose> tasaif: I am using pure CSS
[19:29:52] <R13ose> thanks for the help
[19:29:58] <tasaif> np
[19:30:37] <tasaif> R13ose: http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/n0ht4m3s/3/
[19:30:40] <tasaif> now with less things broken
[19:57:46] <R13ose> In this code: http://pastebin.com/nD8HaLUu the first display of top is getting this error in console: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined"
[19:57:51] <R13ose> How do I fix that?
[20:14:19] <jeffmjack> any ideas on why this isn't working?
[20:14:19] <jeffmjack> http://jsfiddle.net/jeffmjack/1skzqv3d/
[20:18:07] <R13ose> Mine seems to come and go and not show up all the time.
[20:28:53] <R13ose> jeffmjack: are you sure your alert line in jquery is correct?
[20:29:09] <R13ose> I am using CSS Animation but how do I make a div animate before I hide the div in jquery code?
[20:48:02] <R13ose> quiet room
[21:35:23] <tcpman> my jquery won't run..
