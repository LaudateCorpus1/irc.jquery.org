[01:01:58] <funka> hey i saw that crappy movie Inception and now all i can think about is $($);
[01:02:15] <funka> i even bought that shit on blueray and was SO disappointed
[01:02:29] <funka> (missed it while it was in the theatres, you know….)
[01:03:08] <funka> sorry, am ranting in the totally WRONG avenue here
[01:04:21] <funka> we all should know of course that $($) would do nothing important after the first doc-ready?
[01:13:06] <cods> Is there a way to find an element given its container and coordinate? Say a table with several <td>, I would like to find the td that contains given coordinate.
[01:15:14] <cods> (other than by iterating them -in an optimized way- to find it myself)
[01:21:17] <adam007> hello i want ask why this http://pastebin.com/XDnCctrK i already get the records from my database but why it not get to the table
[01:21:26] <adam007> anyone can help ?
[01:49:36] <Mulisak> .
[03:13:24] <danners> hey i am adding img elements in a loop to a document. i want to use the click: thing to add a onclick function to each element. in the function i want to call another function with the loop index as parameter. but this results that its the last loopindex for each element. how could i do this so it works? http://sprunge.us/ijjh
[03:14:04] <buu> I'm sure the answer involves closures.
[03:15:45] <shoky> danners: you need an inner function scope for your loop body:   for (i=0;i<TILENO;i++) { (function(i) {  ...  })(i) }
[03:17:05] <shoky> or use $.each, e.g.:   $.each(new Array(TILENO), function(i) { ...the loop body... })
[03:17:34] <danners> shoky: okay i will look into it thanks
[03:19:55] <danners> shoky: thanks a lot it works :)
[04:03:54] <ShawnRisk> how do I make the top item of a menu highlighted and the sublinks showing up when I click the sublink?  Click top link works but not clicking the sublinks.  Can I use one each function?  Current code:  $( "#topnav a" ).each( function () { if(url == $(this).attr('href')) { }
[04:04:40] <Kambfhase> ?p @ ShawnRisk
[04:04:41] <bot-t> ShawnRisk, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:06:50] <baps> Can anyone advise on how to reference the instance of this jShowOff plugin in this example? http://jsfiddle.net/b2wNR/4/
[04:07:52] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: http://jsfiddle.net/nBtz6/  The links are full urls but I am not using this for the example.
[04:11:14] <baps> I think that example is pretty incomplete, ShawnRisk.
[04:11:45] <ShawnRisk> baps: how come?
[04:12:46] <baps> The HTML just contains a li, and the script is referencing a ul and an element with a topnav id that doesn't exist.
[04:13:28] <Kambfhase> yeah :)
[04:14:12] <ShawnRisk> is this better: http://jsfiddle.net/nBtz6/2/
[04:15:03] <baps> Appears so. What is it that you're trying to achieve?
[04:16:16] <ShawnRisk> When I click any link the top menu item should be highlighted and the sublinks show up.
[04:17:49] <Kambfhase> you might want to use location.pathname
[04:18:45] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: okay but is this for absolute or relative links?
[04:19:12] <Kambfhase> well since you use relative, .pathname would be /info/
[04:19:42] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: in the example I using relative links but in the dev site I am using absolute.
[04:19:51] <Kambfhase> kk
[04:20:59] <ShawnRisk> would .pathname get /info/ and example.com/info/ if I did link either way?
[04:21:08] <Kambfhase> damn, my firebug stopped working with jsFiddle
[04:21:36] <ShawnRisk> I have to go in 9 mins
[04:27:50] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: thoughts?
[04:30:22] <ShawnRisk> I have to go
[04:30:57] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: I will be back on later, and if I see you I will get in touch thanks for the help.
[04:34:28] <kezabelle> Anyone know how to trigger a namespaced event without being bound to a selector? (ie, using $.event.trigger)
[04:35:47] <apdmatos> kezabelle why don't you want to bound an event to a selector?
[04:35:57] <kezabelle> because I don't know what it is
[04:36:23] <apdmatos> you can bind it to $(document)
[04:36:35] <kezabelle> yeah, that's what I'd have thought
[04:36:44] <apdmatos> anyway
[04:36:58] <apdmatos> have try to use $.trigger?
[04:37:08] <kezabelle> I moved from using el.bind() to document.delegate('el' …) with no success
[04:37:12] <kezabelle> http://pastebin.com/wAbue8hA
[04:38:08] <kezabelle> aside: this is using an old, 1.4 version of jQuery, not any of the new on() fancyness
[04:38:42] <apdmatos> hum ok
[04:39:12] <apdmatos> I think that does not work because jquery requires a selector
[04:39:21] <apdmatos> the $ or jquery function
[04:39:32] <apdmatos> is a constructor to jquery
[04:39:36] <apdmatos> object
[04:39:41] <kezabelle> yeah, I know
[04:39:54] <kezabelle> but I don't really see how to decouple the events otherwise
[04:40:16] <apdmatos> As far as I know, you need to have a selector there
[04:40:27] <apdmatos> There's a way
[04:40:46] <apdmatos> you can abstract the events from jquery
[04:40:58] <kezabelle> I tried throwing document in there, to trigger delegation. nada.
[04:41:10] <apdmatos> nada?
[04:41:20] <kezabelle> nothing :o)
[04:41:29] <apdmatos> are you portuguese? :)
[04:41:52] <kezabelle> no, I just know many words for nothing at this point, as I've been banging my head against this for ages ;)
[04:42:14] <apdmatos> lol nice :)
[04:43:03] <apdmatos> so you have tried to use $(document).trigger
[04:43:08] <apdmatos> and that worked right?
[04:43:13] <kezabelle> nope
[04:43:18] <kezabelle> failed miserably
[04:44:26] <apdmatos> how?
[04:44:27] <apdmatos> http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[04:44:47] <apdmatos> as you can see in the example they use trigger to execute click event
[04:44:49] <kezabelle> yeah linking the docs at this point isn't going to help :p
[04:45:07] <apdmatos> can you send me an example?
[04:45:32] <apdmatos> use jsfiddle
[04:45:34] <kezabelle> It'd probably take hours to figure out all the parts and put them in a jsfilddle.
[04:46:08] <apdmatos> I am asking you that because it seems to be a js problem
[04:47:44] <kezabelle> ugh, jsfiddle doesn't even provide jQuery 1.4 :s
[04:48:30] <apdmatos> include jquery 1.4 with a script tag
[04:48:34] <xec> kezabelle: tinker.io does
[04:48:57] <apdmatos> in html section
[04:49:12] <xec> or just use the resources option :P
[04:50:12] <deed02392> Hi guys, I'm trying to use the jAlerts plugin to displya a jAlert on the page load (for example containing a success message). I tried to implement this by putting out HTML with: $(function(){jAlert('Action completed successfully.');}); in a script tag, but it doesn't display
[04:50:13] <deed02392> $ = jQuery
[04:50:47] <Lucky--> deed02392: i use toastr works great, check it out
[04:51:02] <kezabelle> apdmatos: simplest example I can think of: http://jsfiddle.net/fkQbq/
[04:51:08] <Lucky--> https://github.com/CodeSeven/toastr
[04:51:16] <apdmatos> let me check it out
[04:51:16] <kezabelle> note that this is about 500 lines less than I have to wade through though ;)
[04:51:17] <deed02392> i've used that for another project, but my issue is it doesn't seem to be executing jAlert
[04:51:18] <Lucky--> demo: http://codeseven.github.com/toastr/
[04:51:30] <deed02392> I think perhaps because that function doesn't exist when it tries to run, which is why i wrapped it in $(function(){});
[04:51:31] <kezabelle> by all accounts, on load it should alert 3 times. :/
[04:51:32] <Lucky--> console.log it
[04:51:41] <Lucky--> or throw a debugger in there
[04:51:46] <Lucky--> debugger;
[04:51:58] <Lucky--> jsfiddle it, and ill take a look at it
[04:52:23] <kezabelle> life in jQueryland must've been so difficult before jsfiddle et al :D
[04:52:38] <deed02392> i don't get any errors in Firebug
[04:52:57] <deed02392> and it runs perfectly fine if I run jAlert('etc'); from the console
[04:53:01] <deed02392> it displays i mean
[04:53:07] <Kambfhase> ?p @ deed02392
[04:53:08] <bot-t> deed02392, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:53:09] <deed02392> but it's not displaying on the page load when I want it to
[04:54:30] <apdmatos> kezabelle I already know why that's not working
[04:54:32] <apdmatos> well
[04:54:39] <kezabelle> show off ;)
[04:54:57] <apdmatos> when you write this
[04:54:57] <apdmatos> $(document).delegate('div', 'click.test-me', function(event) {
[04:55:07] <deed02392> <script type="text/javascript">$(function(){jAlert('Action completed successfully.');});</script>
[04:55:18] <apdmatos> you are binding the event 'click.test-me' to div element
[04:55:21] <apdmatos> so
[04:55:21] <deed02392> this doesn't work, but jAlert('foo'); works when I run it from the firebug console
[04:55:34] <apdmatos> it will only be fired by this: $('div').trigger('click.test-me');​
[04:55:39] <kezabelle> well
[04:55:42] <deed02392> doesn't this have to do with the browser trying to run jAlert before it's loaded the plugin?
[04:55:52] <kezabelle> fairly certain I'm actually binding to document, but yes, essentially
[04:56:14] <kezabelle> (because delegate only attaches the listener to document, which ensures event.target matches the selector?)
[04:56:40] <Kambfhase> deed02392: I dont see a mistake there. weird.
[04:56:52] <kezabelle> sort of brings me back to the original question though: how the heck do I trigger an event when I don't know the selector? :/
[04:57:17] <apdmatos> lol
[04:57:30] <apdmatos> the selector is a html element
[04:57:31] <deed02392> It's valid to do this isn't it? I have other stuff in a $(function(){}); that's included in another JS file. Could that interfere with it?
[04:57:48] <apdmatos> if you want to trigger a global event
[04:57:59] <apdmatos> you should trigger it in document
[04:58:19] <apdmatos> but, it will only execute the handlers registered on document
[04:58:48] <apdmatos> it is like, when you attach an event to get a click event on an element
[04:58:50] <kezabelle> yes, which is what delegate does
[04:59:15] <apdmatos> no, delegate attaches an event to an element
[04:59:36] <apdmatos> in jquery events always have a context
[04:59:45] <apdmatos> aka, html element
[05:00:09] <deed02392> a-ha I worked around it
[05:00:26] <deed02392> I set the message to a var = ''; then in my included file which does the $(funtion(){}); stuff, I did jAlert(var);
[05:00:42] <deed02392> maybe you can't do  $(funtion(){}); more than once on a page
[05:01:00] <Kambfhase> yes, you can
[05:01:17] <deed02392> never mind, this is cleaner anyway
[05:01:20] <Kambfhase> :)
[05:03:29] <kezabelle> so I can merrily bind events to anything, but I can't then trigger them? sigh
[05:03:52] <apdmatos> no, that's not what I said
[05:04:05] <apdmatos> you can actually bind events to any dom element
[05:04:28] <apdmatos> and you can fired them all with the appropriate selector
[05:05:00] <kezabelle> which amounts to being unable to trigger them, because I don't know the selector.
[05:05:30] <apdmatos> why not?
[05:05:58] <kezabelle> because why should I even need to?
[05:06:21] <apdmatos> that's the signature of trigger function in jquery
[05:06:22] <apdmatos> trigger: function( event, data, elem, onlyHandlers ) {
[05:06:22] <apdmatos> 		// Don't do events on text and comment nodes
[05:06:22] <apdmatos> 		if ( elem && (elem.nodeType === 3 || elem.nodeType === 8) ) {
[05:06:22] <apdmatos> 			return;
[05:06:22] <apdmatos> 		}
[05:06:27] <kezabelle> I've namespaced an event. I want to trigger anything which is set up to listen to the event. Fire it!
[05:06:53] <kezabelle> but I can't, because without amassing every potential DOM node which is listening, it doesn't work.
[05:07:16] <apdmatos> there's an if to check if there's a html element to fire event on
[05:08:19] <apdmatos> kezabelle you have to think a little different
[05:08:35] <apdmatos> you can register the events, and you will trigger the events
[05:09:01] <kezabelle> evidence suggests not.
[05:09:06] <apdmatos> if you register all events to the same html element, and then trigger the events on the same html element
[05:09:09] <apdmatos> this will work
[05:09:23] <kezabelle> lol?
[05:09:30] <apdmatos> imagine
[05:09:51] <kezabelle> so to catch namespaced click events on a specific element somewhere in my DOM tree, I need to bind to document and do all the event matching manually?
[05:10:42] <kezabelle> aside: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/efe51cdf2049906788173390a9e9867f5a5ab47e/src/event.js#L274
[05:10:46] <apdmatos> jquery already handles click events for you
[05:10:51] <kezabelle> shouldn't that fire before the option to return undefined?
[05:11:42] <kezabelle> oh maybe it means global as in not namespaced
[05:12:43] <apdmatos> it will always return undefined
[05:12:43] <apdmatos> // don't do events on text and comment nodes			if ( !elem || elem.nodeType === 3 || elem.nodeType === 8 ) {				return undefined;			}
[05:12:50] <apdmatos> check line 291
[05:13:08] <apdmatos> but it does not mean it will not trigger the event
[05:13:12] <kezabelle> I know
[05:13:17] <apdmatos> in line 280
[05:13:21] <apdmatos> it will trigger the event
[05:13:23] <apdmatos> but
[05:13:40] <kezabelle> yeah, except it clearly doesn't, as demonstrated in the jsfiddle
[05:13:41] <apdmatos> it will not execute your event handler
[05:13:42] <FrameFever> Where can I connect to a mousemove event, that will get fired up when the mouse leaves the browser?
[05:13:52] <apdmatos> because it is binded to a dom element
[05:13:58] <apdmatos> and it is not a global event
[05:14:03] <kezabelle> so ultimately, if I want decoupled events, I have to attach everything to document, and test everything myself?
[05:14:42] <apdmatos> what do you mean with test everything myself?
[05:14:56] <kezabelle> well
[05:15:17] <apdmatos> I think that is the best approach to take
[05:15:27] <kezabelle> if I bind to document, every click will trigger it. So I then need to make sure the event matches, etc. Basically rewrite delegate because delegate doesn't work.
[05:15:30] <apdmatos> because in newer jquery versions
[05:15:38] <apdmatos> you have to provide an html element
[05:16:01] <apdmatos> kezabelle no
[05:16:23] <FrameFever> anybody?
[05:16:25] <FrameFever> any hint
[05:16:29] <apdmatos> if your event name is not 'click'
[05:16:33] <kezabelle> feel free to use that jsfiddle to explain apdmatos, because I don't see a fix otherwise
[05:16:44] <apdmatos> it will not be triggered by every click
[05:16:54] <apdmatos> ok
[05:17:04] <apdmatos> I will wirte an example for you
[05:17:08] <kezabelle> <3 thx
[05:18:42] <black_warlock> hello
[05:18:55] <kezabelle> ahoy
[05:19:04] <black_warlock> how do i set function and recall it inside the script ?
[05:19:10] <black_warlock> hell doesnt work
[05:19:37] <black_warlock> $(function pip (){alert('hello')}
[05:19:48] <black_warlock> how do i call this inside script ?
[05:19:57] <FrameFever> jastor: are you ok?
[05:20:48] <kezabelle> black_warlock: doesn't that shorthand into document ready?
[05:21:43] <black_warlock> nope
[05:21:46] <black_warlock> it is outside
[05:22:01] <Kambfhase> black_warlock: function pip(){ alert("hell0");} $(pip)
[05:22:08] <black_warlock> but i have to call function one time inside doc ready
[05:22:28] <kezabelle> what Kambfhase said
[05:22:45] <black_warlock> wtf doesnt work O.O
[05:22:53] <kezabelle> paste into jsfiddle?
[05:23:07] <black_warlock> doesn't that shorthand into document ready?
[05:23:12] <Kambfhase> what kezabelle said
[05:23:15] <black_warlock> ReferenceError: trigclick is not defined
[05:23:41] <apdmatos> kezabelle, check it out: http://jsfiddle.net/RyEHb/
[05:24:06] <kezabelle> hmmm
[05:24:13] <kezabelle> well, that's not the same, but it'd probably work
[05:24:14] <apdmatos> for custom events, I use the global document
[05:24:23] <kezabelle> yeah, so would I, if it were a custom event ;)
[05:24:28] <kezabelle> (which I guess it'll have to be)
[05:24:34] <apdmatos> for specific events, I use specific html element
[05:24:45] <kezabelle> (it's not, it's a click event, namespaced)
[05:25:08] <apdmatos> in your example, it were a custom event...
[05:25:13] <kezabelle> no it wasn't
[05:25:30] <apdmatos> $.event.trigger('click.mynamespace');
[05:25:41] <apdmatos> click.mynamespace
[05:25:42] <kezabelle> that's not a custom event? that's click, namespaced
[05:25:49] <apdmatos> this event does not exist on dom
[05:26:00] <apdmatos> well
[05:26:13] <kezabelle> yes, it does
[05:26:13] <kezabelle> http://docs.jquery.com/Namespaced_Events
[05:26:19] <apdmatos> in DOM events are identified by a string
[05:26:29] <apdmatos> and click.mynamespace, is different from click
[05:27:02] <kezabelle> Yeah, I rather assumed jQuery.Event objectrs handled that. Do they not? o_O
[05:27:10] <kezabelle> *objects
[05:27:35] <apdmatos> I think that namespaced events are custom events
[05:27:48] <apdmatos> let me check on source code
[05:27:52] <kezabelle> heh
[05:27:54] <kezabelle> sry :D
[05:28:24] <kezabelle> hmmm
[05:28:38] <kezabelle> looks like only live/die use rnamespaces
[05:28:52] <apdmatos> hum
[05:29:01] <apdmatos> looks like they handle ir
[05:29:03] <apdmatos> *it
[05:29:04] <kezabelle> which is what I guess handles splitting the namespace into parts
[05:29:44] <kezabelle> oh, that doesn't matter, delegate *is* live in 1.4
[05:30:36] <apdmatos> they handle it, but you have the same problem
[05:30:53] <apdmatos> they only be triggered on a html element
[05:31:34] <kezabelle> well I guess the point is that namespaced events are kind of useless, so I'll have to refactor everything to listen to some crap custom events :/
[05:32:03] <kezabelle> as if my code weren't previously horrible enough :D
[05:32:47] <apdmatos> lol
[05:33:29] <apdmatos> see that as an opportunity to make it beautiful
[05:33:42] <kezabelle> see, here's silly: that custom event you used on document, you put click. in front of it, it becomes a standard event, namespaced :/
[05:34:09] <kezabelle> please, beautiful would be if it properly decoupled events from specific domnodes for me :/
[05:35:04] <apdmatos> but you can decouple that
[05:35:11] <FrameFever> How can I prevent that a link is shown when I am with my mouse over a link?
[05:35:17] <apdmatos> build an object to abstract that
[05:35:24] <apdmatos> and inside that object
[05:35:33] <apdmatos> use jquery to register events for you
[05:36:18] <kezabelle> yeah I'm not refactoring something that works fine completely just to fix that :p
[05:36:41] <apdmatos> lol
[05:36:45] <apdmatos> ok
[05:36:51] <kezabelle> I don't like javascript *that* much :D
[05:37:02] <apdmatos> why?
[05:37:07] <apdmatos> I used to say that too
[05:37:40] <kezabelle> because I really dislike the language, and the tools available.
[05:37:45] <apdmatos> but when I notice, js was wonderful
[05:38:01] <apdmatos> it is really powerful
[05:38:04] <kezabelle> so?
[05:38:08] <kezabelle> plenty of things are powerful
[05:38:13] <apdmatos> lol
[05:38:16] <FrameFever> is anybody here able to help me?
[05:38:44] <kezabelle> But rather than digress into reasons I'd prefer never to write JS again, I'll just thank you for your help ;)
[05:39:08] <apdmatos> you are welcome :)
[05:41:47] <kezabelle> so far I'm at 15 lines of comments ranting about why I have to refactor this. Good thing it'll be minified :D
[05:42:19] <apdmatos> lol
[05:50:47] <Dragon707> Does someone know how to iterate throug a table and search the input elements ?
[05:50:51] <Dragon707> like: http://jsfiddle.net/RRasC/1/
[05:52:59] <pachet> FrameFever: replace the link with some other element that is styled to look the same
[05:53:06] <apdmatos> Dragon707 check this: http://jsfiddle.net/RRasC/2/
[05:54:45] <Dragon707> apdmatos: Ok, but what when i have 2 tables with settings: http://jsfiddle.net/RRasC/4/
[05:55:29] <FrameFever> pachet: style to look the same?
[05:55:55] <apdmatos> wait
[05:56:05] <apdmatos> let me write the example for you
[05:56:09] <Dragon707> ok :)
[05:57:14] <pachet> FrameFever: yeah, because as long as you're mousing over an anchor you're going to see that behavior
[06:00:58] <apdmatos> Gragon707 there you have it: http://jsfiddle.net/RRasC/7/
[06:01:40] <Dragon707> Works like a charm :-), thanks apdmatos
[06:02:16] <apdmatos> you are welcome ;)
[06:02:56] <FrameFever> pachet: can I simulate a link via a div?
[06:03:08] <FrameFever> than It muste be hidden I think
[06:03:32] <pachet> sure you can
[06:03:43] <pachet> just collate the href you want that div to follow somehow
[06:03:48] <kezabelle> apdmatos: so does it seem acceptable to you to bind a bunch of custom events to document, and then use .bind('click') on specific selectors to do $(document).trigger('my-custom-event')?
[06:03:50] <pachet> assign an onclick handler, and css hover rules
[06:10:19] <adam007> anyone here know where i can download jqgrid sample ?
[06:11:59] <Onkeltem> Hi all. How can I know width of an element which is hidden?
[06:12:48] <pachet> you can guess, but short answer is that you can't
[06:13:06] <Onkeltem> I have a <select> elemtn located in a tab which is hidden, but a plugin initialization  (chosen plugin) occurs before a user start clicking tabs
[06:13:12] <Onkeltem> any solution for this?
[06:13:19] <Onkeltem> pachet: thanks for the answer
[06:13:26] <cusco> hidden or display none?
[06:13:41] <pachet> the usual trick is to just have it outside the boundaries of the visible page
[06:13:44] <Onkeltem> let me check (but I'm its not displayed)
[06:14:04] <Onkeltem> pachet: with visibility hidden?
[06:14:15] <cusco> there is visibility hidden and display none
[06:14:16] <pachet> not even necessary
[06:14:23] <Onkeltem> and positioned absolutely i guess ,right?
[06:14:28] <pachet> just throw enough margin on it to make sure it's not visible
[06:14:29] <Onkeltem> to not affect flow
[06:14:38] <cusco> if its just visibility you can access its width
[06:16:23] <Onkeltem> Nah, not the case I think. Tabs are implemented here via <fieldset> elements, and only visible tab is displayed, while the rest have display: none...
[06:22:51] <adam007> hi all why when i want get data from database via php and phpgrid why im alway get this code Creating default object from empty value in
[06:23:02] <adam007> i see via firebug
[06:23:25] <guy> does jQuery have a method to return a computed width? ie. that would take into account -webkit-transform: scale()
[06:29:25] <Onkeltem> Maybe there is a shortcut function which makes this automatically like 1) moving (a copy of) element outside, 2) making it visible 3) measuring its size 4) rollback 5) return value?
[06:31:55] <adam007> any one here can help ? why phpgrid say this via firebug Creating default object from empty value in
[06:32:41] <guy> that has nothing to do with jQuery, now does it?
[06:35:48] <adam007> anybody can help me ?
[06:36:33] <guy> adam007: that was addressed to you.
[06:38:13] <adam007> guy i want create data table use jqgrid framework, but it always show this "Creating default object from empty value in" when i run in my localhost...
[06:38:29] <guy> adam007: that has nothing to do with jQuery
[06:40:02] <adam007> guy so where i can ask ? jqgrid is plugin use jquery too so i try to ask via this channel
[06:43:05] <onr> jQuery.ScrollTo still dominates the scrolling industry?

[07:07:23] <black_warlock> hu ?
[07:39:05] <cobra> hello, i have a site where i am using ajax for navigation, i have jquery in contact us page, which doesnt work if you click on it, but when you refresh the page, it works and scroller disappears, whats wrong with it http://whistlersfishandchips.co.uk/wordpress/
[08:02:47] <thomasgriffin> Let's say my target element is nested inside two <ul> elements. For each <ul> element that it is nested inside, I want to add a dash (-) before the target element. How can I do this easily without having to manually check and add the appropriate number of dashes?
[08:05:18] <qiau> is there an easy way to "black out" an entire website? i.e. change all css element color to the same?
[08:47:47] <abletony84> Hi, how do I switch between two images like on http://www.jpegmini.com/?
[08:48:58] <SmartTowel1> I'm using the jquery phototagger plugin for a project.  I wanna replace the prompts() that take a message from a user and replace them with a modal that has 3 inputs.  But I still want the flow to work the same.  So when they fill out the modal and submit (press ok) it should just continue at that point in the code.  So basically, is there a way to customize thr prompt() method and/or make my own version of it?
[08:50:31] <SmartTowel1> In the code now, var message = prompt(...).  Then more code runs after to add the tag.  I want the same behavior but instead of one input, for three inputs to be stored.  Either as message.one, message.two, message.three or some other way where i can access all three immediately after.
[08:50:40] <SmartTowel1> Any help on this would be appreciated :)
[08:57:42] <johnkpaul> SmartTowel1: sadly, other than the real prompt there's no way to have the value known immediately after
[08:57:52] <johnkpaul> javascript won't allow you to block like that in your own code
[08:58:13] <johnkpaul> that's probably why it uses prompt in the first place, because it's the easier way to go
[08:58:44] <SmartTowel1> ok. do u know if there is a way to style the prompt with custom styles at all?
[09:01:08] <johnkpaul> SmartTowel1: there is not
[09:02:56] <SmartTowel1> would a viable solution be to use ajax?  so when they finish drawing the tag, i will show the modal with three inputs and set hidden inputs with the top, left, height and width.  then on submit of the form i would use the ajax to save the tag.
[09:04:09] <johnkpaul> SmartTowel1: viable solution to what? if you add ajax, you're going to have the same issue, the data you need won't be accesible immediately after, you'll have to wait for a callback
[09:04:20] <johnkpaul> if you're willing to rewrite this to handle that, you don't need ajax anyway
[09:06:51] <SmartTowel1> johnkpaul, here is a fiddle with the section that i want to modify with the custom modal.
[09:06:52] <SmartTowel1> http://jsfiddle.net/Pnku3/
[09:07:57] <SmartTowel1> i know that we can't have the same behavior as the prompt(), so it will need to be altered to work with my '#saveTagModal' which is a 3 input form.
[09:08:30] <SmartTowel1> how would u do it?
[09:09:15] <johnkpaul> SmartTowel1: http://jsfiddle.net/Pnku3/1/
[09:11:24] <SmartTowel1> how do i check if its dismissed?
[09:12:30] <johnkpaul> SmartTowel1: depends on how you made your custom dialog
[09:12:40] <johnkpaul> it's up to you, if you're using jquery ui dialog, there's docs for taht
[09:13:44] <SmartTowel1> ok, i will try it out. appreciate ur help on this. thank u very much.
[09:14:15] <johnkpaul> SmartTowel1: no problem, have fun
[09:15:51] <abletony84> how come this works:
[09:15:51] <abletony84> var $stickyElementPos = $stickyElement.prev('h1').offset().top; $stickyElement.prev('h1').height();
[09:15:54] <abletony84> but not this?
[09:15:56] <abletony84> var $stickyElementPos = $stickyElement.prev('h1').offset().top;
[09:15:59] <abletony84> var $stickyElementPos += $stickyElement.prev('h1').height();
[09:16:14] <SmartTowel1> does the height return 0?
[09:17:03] <abletony84> SmartTowel1: not sure, getting Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token .
[09:23:38] <aslant> hi, does jquery work ok on iOS? Cos I've got issues with iPad. Separate delegated click event is firing on every element matching selector in hierarchy - i.e. it does not appear to be one propagated event

[10:13:54] <black_warlock> hi anyone ?
[10:14:03] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/pNePa/4/
[10:14:42] <black_warlock> i ve setted a button on the li that contains other ul
[10:14:59] <black_warlock> this corrispondence is not good
[10:15:46] <black_warlock> i wish to set the button with + or - reading if the ul is effectively hidden or visible
[10:16:18] <black_warlock> also without calling the toggle on click
[10:20:46] <black_warlock> how can i check if the css of one ul ul .css is display:none ?
[10:21:21] <black_warlock> i have tried with $(ul ul).css('display','none')==true
[10:21:40] <black_warlock> nobody knows ?
[10:24:41] <fruitwerks> Hey all... have in issue I can't figure out. I am trying to get at least a full list of my google contacts - or at least all in a specific group. If I do anything in the request other than a basic one, I get errors. I don't know if it is a jquery issue or something else....
[10:26:19] <fruitwerks> if the request is https://www.google.com/m8/feeds/contacts/default/full?access_token=blahblah it works, but I only get 25 contacts, if I try to add ?max-results=foo or anything else I get errors
[10:39:32] <fruitwerks> does anyone know how to modify headers with jsonp?
[10:45:53] <systemfault> jsonp is creating a <script> element and setting its src, you cannot modify headers… JSONP is a hack, nothing else
[10:52:20] <tomasm-> is there a way to rearrange the order that event handlers trigger? and can I get a list of what events are registered (even if just a hack) to an object?
[10:53:05] <tomasm-> I have a link that has two events... the problem is I need one to fire after the other
[10:55:07] <uSMS> I am iterating through a list of dom elements, and I need to get the attribute name from the current element, but this.attr('name') doesnt work.
[10:55:10] <uSMS> what do I need to do?
[10:55:39] <rmurphey> uSMS: this is the raw dom element -- use $(this) to turn it into a jquery object on which you can call the attr method
[10:56:06] <uSMS> ohhh ok
[10:56:38] <uSMS> thanks!
[11:15:53] <SmartTowel1> johnkpaul, im trying to implement the code u gave me earlier, but i dont know how to check if the modal has been dismised or not.
[11:16:02] <SmartTowel1> im using twitter bootstraps modal.
[11:17:28] <SmartTowel1> this is what i have currently.
[11:17:29] <SmartTowel1> http://jsfiddle.net/Edccf/
[11:17:37] <SmartTowel1> is this being implemented correctly thus far?
[11:19:20] <NoelB> I wrote a tiny JQuery function for "longPress" and it works really well.  However, I cannot figure out how to make it work with .on("longPress").  Can someone point me to documentation where I can learn how to create custom events for use with .on() ?
[11:19:39] <NoelB> currently i have to use $(selector).longPress() but i'd prefer to use .on()
[11:19:56] <ajpiano> http://benalman.com/news/2010/03/jquery-special-events/
[11:22:22] <NoelB> thanks so much ajpiano, this looks like exactly what i was looking for.  Do you have any recommendations for how to prioritize a longPress event so that it stops propagation for a standard click event on the same element ?
[11:24:20] <ajpiano> presumably by some tracking of a time differential between mousedown and mouseup, and using that differential to conditionally stop the propagation of the subsequent click
[11:25:36] <NoelB> if I don't stop propagation in the longPress, click still fires?  or should I perform a manual click trigger event if enough time hasn't elapsed when they mouseup ?
[11:25:43] <SmartTowel1> anyone know how i can check in an element has been dismissed?
[11:26:57] <black_warlock> dam who can help with this http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/pNePa/50/
[11:27:20] <caleb_io> black_warlock what are you trying to accomplish?
[11:28:02] <black_warlock> i m trying to make a functions that always check if ULs are visible or not
[11:28:16] <black_warlock> independently if i click button or not
[11:28:35] <black_warlock> it must change the + inside button
[11:28:51] <black_warlock> with - id the ULs are not hidden
[11:30:06] <ajpiano> NoelB: click is always going to fire, you just have to probably stop prop and preventDefault if the time threshhold isn't met
[11:31:12] <johnkpaul> SmartTowel1: you can bind to the 'hide' event of the boostrap modal
[11:31:33] <johnkpaul> $('#your_modal').on('hide', function(){})
[11:32:16] <SmartTowel1> yea, i was looking at that earlier
[11:32:36] <SmartTowel1> so would i still need to call deferred.resolve?
[11:33:04] <johnkpaul> SmartTowel1: yes, when the modal is dismissed, you need to resolve the deferred with the value that the person typed into your fake prompt
[11:33:53] <SmartTowel1> so deferred.resolve( $('#saveTagModal').val() )  <-- ?
[11:34:02] <SmartTowel1> like that?
[11:34:52] <johnkpaul> SmartTowel1: yes, if that's what the value you want in the message variable of your example to be
[11:35:20] <black_warlock> wtf doesnt work dam
[11:35:25] <black_warlock> it driving me crazyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
[11:36:36] <SmartTowel1> and when does deferred.then run?
[11:36:47] <johnkpaul> when you resolve the deferred

[11:56:43] <ryanneufeld> which probably isn't helping
[11:57:47] <ryanneufeld> My advice, get a static html page working the way you want
[11:57:51] <ryanneufeld> with the plugins you want
[11:57:57] <ryanneufeld> and then make that your WP theme
[11:58:31] <ronson> jquery is still coding, theres only so much u can plug and play :P
[11:59:13] <NoelB> @ajpiano or anyone else:  I have made a longClick special event.  Its purpose is to fire long click events, or a "clicked" event if the timer has not expired.  I'm struggling with how to make a generic longClick event where I can make many ".on('longClick','.someClass')" declarations.  Here is my jsfiddle, any help would be much appreciated!  http://jsfiddle.net/K66kF/
[12:00:16] <cobra> none of the scripts are loaded twice
[12:00:24] <cobra> you can see the source code
[12:00:25] <NoelB> the goal is to convert this to stop using .item, and to have it applied globally (or to the selector I specify in .on()
[12:01:13] <ryanneufeld> cobra: I'm looking at the resources in the webkit inspector
[12:02:08] <ryanneufeld> cobra: and you are wrong. I looked at your source and they *are* loaded more than once.
[12:02:47] <cobra> the jquery versions ?
[12:03:04] <ryanneufeld> FML
[12:03:34] <ajpiano> NoelB: i don't have a tonne of experience with the special events api, and that article kind of comes from a pre-baked-in-event-delegation phase
[12:04:22] <ajpiano> if you can stick around here for a bit you might get ahold of someone like ben_alman who can help give a lift
[12:04:27] <ajpiano> but probably not on the weekend :)
[12:05:18] <cobra> ?
[12:05:50] <NoelB> ah ok, thanks.  i tried using .on("longClick","*") but the thing fired 3 times lol
[12:06:32] <cobra> what FML
[12:08:26] <NoelB> oh @ajpiano I think I got it…  http://jsfiddle.net/K66kF/1/   Long pressing on the results box also fires correctly, woohoo.  Im just unsure about the quality/performance of my code.  ill see if I can find ben_alman on monday for help
[12:08:56] <ajpiano> awesome
[12:09:33] <cobra> see yet again
[12:09:43] <cobra> no real solution, only guess
[12:11:00] <black_warlock> the toggle() function works with visibility or with display ?
[12:11:01] <ryanneufeld> cobra: this channel is not here to do your work for you. You have been given help by one of the best JS devs I know of and that still doesn't seem to be enough for you
[12:11:39] <cobra> ryaan: i didnt ask for spoon feeding also, my simple question was, how to debug jquery and know what is causing the errors, thats all
[12:11:40] <ryanneufeld> cobra: I don't know what you're expecting, but I know I have personally told you some of your problems.

[12:13:35] <NoelB> Cobra, chrome also has a built-in inspector with console if you need to step in and out of scripts.  just right-click your page and hit "Inspect element" and it'll come up.
[12:13:53] <ryanneufeld> cobra: then simply dismissed the work of ajpiano who is one of the core jquery developers.
[12:14:07] <ryanneufeld> cobra: at what point have we not told you how to debug?
[12:16:48] <cobra> Noe: i did look into chrome as well, but there is nothing mentioned about the slideshow which is not function
[12:17:57] <cobra> ryaanneyfeld, you did help but you are showing me sites which i can see on google as well, and i tried firebug, wp enque scrip, everything but nothing's working and the thing is i don't know what the error is also

[12:18:08] <tetbert> how can I make it selected="true"?
[12:18:46] <ryanneufeld> tetbert: selected="selected" is the correct value for that attribute
[12:18:52] <ryanneufeld> tetbert: what iui?
[12:18:58] <ryanneufeld> *what is
[12:19:18] <brekfist> Hi guys. I'm trying to get colorbox working, and it all looks fine, overlay pops up, but there's no modal content. No js errors. Just not working. I'd be very grateful for another pair of eyes. http://bit.ly/Uke6v4
[12:19:20] <tetbert> ryanneufeld: iui is a mobile framework, like jquery mobile. it really demands selected="true" :/
[12:19:44] <ryanneufeld> tetbert: then you should file a bug report with them
[12:19:50] <tetbert> ryanneufeld: I can change it to selected="true" in the elements inspector, and iui picks it up.
[12:20:51] <tetbert> alright ryanneufeld. i'm going to use .setAttribute()
[12:21:12] <ryanneufeld> tetbert: though you should file a bug with iui
[12:21:21] <ryanneufeld> since selected="true" isn't the standard afaik
[12:21:47] <tetbert> i know its not
[12:21:55] <tetbert> but they would have a lot of documentation to update
[12:22:12] <ryanneufeld> and?

[12:26:50] <ryanneufeld> tetbert: the amount of work it takes to fix a bug should not stop you from filing it. If it means that the product could improve from fixing it. :)
[12:26:57] <brekfist> correction to the above: the content is there, just isn't made visible when colorbox runs.

[13:14:16] <UltraMC> To be more specyfic, selecting it from many items like: div class="ELEMENT_LISTY HIDE"><div class="TITLE" id="id_'.$id[$key].'">
[13:14:16] <hye> and do a selector with a click function
[13:14:29] <UltraMC> yeah they all have the same class-"TITLE"!
[13:14:39] <hye> $('.bla').click
[13:14:54] <UltraMC> hye Im cool with that but how to get id in there? :)
[13:15:08] <hye> $("#blah").click(function() {  alert("Handler for .click() called.");});
[13:15:16] <chris_cook> this.id
[13:15:18] <chris_cook> i think
[13:15:37] <hye> in the click event do:  $(this).attr('id');
[13:15:38] <chris_cook> $(this).attr('id') for definite
[13:15:56] <UltraMC> great! letm e test it
[13:17:01] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/pNePa/68/ need help with this funciton pls
[13:17:02] <UltraMC> Thank you hye, chris_cook !
[13:17:09] <black_warlock> checkbutt doesnt work
[13:17:19] <UltraMC> black_warlock, what is checkbutt?
[13:17:38] <black_warlock> UltraMC there is a fiddle man
[13:18:00] <UltraMC> black_warlock, you could describe more what exacly you desire, and what is not good there
[13:18:26] <black_warlock> a function that check if the ul are open and update text in the buttons
[13:18:57] <black_warlock> if ul are visibles then the button has - if are closed has +
[13:19:51] <black_warlock> in first instance , when you open the page it works
[13:20:11] <black_warlock> when you open one UL , the + becomes -
[13:20:18] <black_warlock> but not vice
[13:20:20] <black_warlock> why ?
[13:21:00] <black_warlock> this script its part of another bigger script that execut some actions of display and hide ULs
[13:21:29] <black_warlock> so i need a function that self check every time if UL are closed or opened
[13:27:05] <baps> Does anyone know how I'd reference the jShowOff instance in this example to make the slideshow animate to slide 2? It has a gotoAndPause function, but I can't reference the instace. http://jsfiddle.net/b2wNR/4/
[13:32:38] <UltraMC> black_warlock, I cant help you its to late. Sorry
[13:44:14] <black_warlock> UltraMC
[13:44:22] <UltraMC> Yes?
[13:44:35] <black_warlock> can you tell me on which properties act the .toggle89 ?
[13:44:42] <black_warlock> toggle()
[13:44:52] <black_warlock> display or visibility ?
[13:45:08] <UltraMC> black_warlock, it display:none/block
[13:45:09] <black_warlock> because i dunno why this script should work now
[13:45:35] <black_warlock> dam
[13:45:38] <black_warlock> its strange
[13:47:06] <black_warlock> why this damed button after the first click
[13:47:14] <black_warlock> give always block later
[13:47:24] <black_warlock> i setted an alert
[13:47:25] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/pNePa/83/
[13:47:43] <UltraMC> black_warlock, I dont want to be rude but your code looks messy. Anyway it changes it to -, but wont check back to +
[13:47:45] <black_warlock> but inspecting the html code , i see the ul properties change
[13:48:13] <UltraMC> black_warlock, before changing - o + change elements style back from block ;-)
[13:49:28] <eip56> what kind of event information do i get when i pass like $(img).each(function(e)
[13:49:31] <eip56> what would e give me
[13:49:41] <UltraMC> black_warlock, dont give up mate!
[13:50:26] <black_warlock> but that function is done from .toggle () UltraMC
[13:50:45] <black_warlock> it means toggle sux ?
[13:50:53] <UltraMC> black_warlock, I am mumbling right now is late as hell and Im dead
[13:51:00] <UltraMC> toogle is cool I use it all the time
[13:51:04] <black_warlock> nm
[13:55:09] <kickandrew> black_warlock:
[13:55:12] <kickandrew> http://jsfiddle.net/Znynm/
[13:55:54] <UltraMC> all hail kickandrew
[13:57:13] <black_warlock> why did you remove toggle ?
[13:57:20] <kickandrew> because you don't need it
[13:57:33] <black_warlock> so it s fukked that dam toggle
[13:57:43] <kickandrew> I don't much care for toggle.
[13:58:44] <kickandrew> it's limiting, and loses state in certain edge cases
[14:00:00] <black_warlock> gosh
[14:00:10] <imanc1> golly
[14:00:12] <black_warlock> it always loose state man
[14:00:33] <black_warlock> after 1st click its not able to read the css state
[14:00:45] <black_warlock> and i noticed it since 2 hours
[14:00:55] <black_warlock> was just strange dam
[14:01:07] <kickandrew> no, your code just wasn't doing what you wanted it to do
[14:01:13] <kickandrew> toggle works, but let css handle this case
[14:01:34] <black_warlock> look this
[14:01:36] <imanc1> i've built a custom select box, and progressively enhancing existing select boxes by replacing them with my udpated version.  The question I have is, how can I pick up/and trigger the events that have already been bound to original select list?
[14:01:59] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/pNePa/88/
[14:02:12] <black_warlock> the alert always give the ul display blocked
[14:02:24] <black_warlock> if inspect the html code you will see its not blocked
[14:03:02] <kickandrew> black_warlock enjoy the code man, that's all the feedback I have for you!
[14:03:18] <black_warlock> kk
[14:03:19] <kickandrew> imanc1: got a pastebin?
[14:03:24] <kickandrew> or jsfiddle rather
[14:03:38] <imanc1> I'll build one
[14:03:44] <kickandrew> jQuery has a .trigger function
[14:04:04] <kickandrew> so $(element).trigger('whateverevent')
[14:04:16] <imanc1> kickandrew: these are the custom selects I built (without the progressive enhancement tho) .. http://www.django-developer.co.uk/customselect/
[14:19:57] <upmauro> http://dpaste.com/815267/, why alert raise empty string :( ... ?
[14:21:27] <kickandrew> the html() method is used with the $('whatever') selector
[14:21:42] <kickandrew> you've defined imgStatus as the attribute of a selector
[14:22:08] <bot-t> .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[14:22:18] <bot-t> upmauro, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[14:22:46] <upmauro> kickandrew, huum.. thanks !
[14:23:39] <ryanneufeld> upmauro: html returns the html contents of the first item in the jquery collection you have
[14:23:50] <ryanneufeld> in your case you're attempting to get the html contents of an image tag
[14:23:58] <ryanneufeld> upmauro: can you see why that's a problem?
[14:24:30] <kickandrew> exactly, img tags are self-closing.  There's nothing within them.
[14:24:38] <Ontology> upmauro: You want to alert imgStatus.attr('src')
[14:24:57] <ryanneufeld> stahp u guise
[14:25:07] <ryanneufeld> I was trying to make him figure it out
[14:25:11] <ryanneufeld> :P
[14:25:15] <kickandrew> hahahh
[14:25:31] <Ontology> Yeah, which is frustrating some times.  Now he sees and now he can figure it out by looking at the real answer vs fake answer :P
[14:25:58] <upmauro> got it !
[14:30:07] <uSMS> I am using jquery draggable for drag and drop on on of my pages
[14:30:25] <uSMS> and to tell where it is dropped im using .offset
[14:30:41] <uSMS> and a bunch of if statements to put it into the correct place in the grid based on the pixels
[14:30:46] <uSMS> which is absurd.
[14:30:58] <uSMS> whats the best way to tell into which div something is dropped
[14:52:40] <Salt> so I'm trying to write a function which adds a hover class on li's to get around IE sucking, however I'm getting an error saying it's not supported by that element type, any ideas?
[14:58:02] <rmurphey> ?demo @ Salt

[15:03:05] <ink_> eze peoples
[15:03:12] <ink_> it's saturday night
[15:03:21] <ink_> hands up if you're short one social life
[15:03:23] <ink_> come one now
[15:03:27] <ink_> on*
[15:03:44] <ink_> jt
[15:03:59] <ink_> it's time for a little winos nursery rhyme
[15:04:09] <ink_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbl34S8RYI
[15:04:17] <ink_> have a little Tom Waits
[15:06:43] <ShawnRisk> Is there a way to do this: $(".usermedia div.not_friends || .usermedia div.is_friend").addClass("ctaSmall"); or do I have to create two different lines with this?
[15:07:12] <ink_> two lines
[15:07:25] <ink_> no i lie
[15:07:43] <ink_> that should return all matching elements
[15:07:54] <ink_> and thus add ctaSmall to not_ and is_
[15:08:09] <ajpiano> $(".usermedia div").filter(".not_friends, .is_friend")
[15:08:16] <ink_> ^^
[15:08:23] <ajpiano> you use a comma to do "OR" not double pipes
[15:08:24] <ajpiano> in selectors
[15:08:45] <ink_> i really much find another chan, it's quite rare i use jquery
[15:08:54] <ink_> ty ajpiano
[15:09:46] <ink_> i came here like 3 days ago to solve a specific issue and ive stayed ever since
[15:09:49] <ShawnRisk> ajpiano: thanks trying now
[15:11:26] <ajpiano> i came here like 4 and a half years ago to solve a specific issue and i've stayed ever since
[15:11:26] <ajpiano> :p
[15:12:06] <ShawnRisk> ajpiano: that doesn't work for me, just goes back to the style I had before.
[15:12:20] <ShawnRisk> this is the code now: $(".usermedia div").filter(".not_friends, .is_friend").addClass("ctaSmall");
[15:12:33] <ajpiano> debug it man
[15:12:47] <ink_> how does php handle format strings in wonder...
[15:13:17] <ink_> badly
[15:13:22] <ink_> appears to be the answer
[15:13:50] <ink_> pretending you're C is not allowed
[15:13:52] <ink_> when you
[15:13:55] <ink_> 're not C
[15:14:47] <Kenrick> hey everyone
[15:19:19] <ShawnRisk> I got this to work, it was my elseif statement, which is suppose to be else if
[15:20:06] <ink_> sup Kenrick
[15:20:27] <ink_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbl34S8RYI
[15:20:41] <ink_> perhaps ya got a little soul
[15:20:49] <ink_> but this aint no soul music
[15:20:59] <Noeble> question: I have a dragable object inside an iframe.. if I by accident happens to drag the mouse outside the iframe the draggable hangs up. WHen I pull my mouse back in the dragable objects moves by itself without me clicking on it. It stops when I click on it a second time
[15:21:05] <Noeble> anyone know why this is happening?
[15:21:20] <ink_> iframes are the devils work
[15:21:33] <ink_> i know because i work with em as well :-/
[15:21:41] <ink_> browser?
[15:21:47] <Noeble> chrome in this case
[15:22:41] <ink_> its a tall order
[15:22:46] <ink_> but can you jsfiddle it
[15:23:36] <ink_> tbh thats a bullshit rqst cos i've experienced the same thing
[15:23:49] <ink_> A) what ver jquery
[15:24:01] <Noeble> very hard, to much code and dependencies.. but its realyl just an iframe with an image inside. It works when within the iframe but as fast as I pull the mouse outside it hangs and the object will then automaticly follow my mouse when I get back inside the frame until I click again
[15:24:29] <ink_> yeah i kno
[15:25:12] <ink_> tell me Noeble
[15:25:13] <thinkerweb> Hi, I have an a few images, I want to click an image and have it appear fullsize and up in the z-index
[15:26:13] <ink_> thinkerweb: then do that
[15:26:29] <ink_> Noeble: is this desktoppery?
[15:26:35] <thinkerweb> $(".overlayclassimage").click(function() { $(this).attr({"z-index":"10"});... });?
[15:26:50] <Noeble> ink_: desktoppery?
[15:26:53] <thinkerweb> You think that would work?
[15:26:54] <ink_> or is there any "mobile" stuff involved
[15:27:03] <ink_> so tap events etc
[15:27:29] <thinkerweb> jquery mobile
[15:27:51] <ink_> one at a time
[15:28:13] <ShawnRisk> This code doesn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/nBtz6/2/  Suppose to happen is that if I click the sublinks or top link, the top link highlights and the sublinks are shown.  This works for the top link but not the sublinks.  Any ideas why?
[15:28:44] <ink_> Noeble: ?
[15:31:10] <Noeble> ink_: its just an ordinary webpage. I have a container that I let users upload a background and re-position it
[15:31:54] <Noeble> ink_: I think it would be solved if I could simulate a mouse release
[15:32:04] <Noeble> when I get outside the iframe
[15:38:09] <thinkerweb> how do you put your search directly in the url for google?  google.com/&q=test doesn't work
[15:43:35] <rmurphey> thinkerweb: https://www.google.com/search?q=test
[15:43:54] <thinkerweb> thx rmurphey
[15:44:22] <ShawnRisk> Any thoughts on my question?
[15:51:20] <gates> how does noConflict work? if theres 2 noConflicts on one page what happens?
[15:53:19] <gcpeters> I'm pretty sure noConflict just releases the $ variable, making it undefined
[15:54:53] <ShawnRisk> This code doesn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/nBtz6/2/  Suppose to happen is that if I click the sublinks or top link, the top link highlights and the sublinks are shown.  This works for the top link but not the sublinks.  Any ideas why?
[15:55:17] <gates> but i can do like var j = jQuery.noConflict(); ?
[15:55:42] <gcpeters> yea, it returns a ref to jQuery
[15:59:47] <black_warlock> im frieng
[16:05:32] <gates> gcpeters: it wont break anyone elses JQuery script?
[16:08:10] <florence_> hello... can anyone help to send the id of my autocomplete item when submitting the form http://jsfiddle.net/xyRrF/124/
[16:09:33] <gcpeters> gates: it could, if they rely on $ being a ref to jQuery, if it's a well written plugin they will be fine, if is some code else where use $ it will break
[16:18:53] <ShawnRisk> :(
[16:21:17] <florence_> =/
[16:21:43] <ShawnRisk> no one to answer questions
[16:22:18] <florence_> i see
[16:23:08] <gcpeters> ShawnRisk: when I click it tries to go to another page, when I hover I get the behavior you described, seems to work for me, chrome on mac
[16:23:58] <gates> if I have a website that has JQuery already loaded and i want to have a service that loaded a script that used JQuery, how to I ensure that my code and jquery lib loading will not mess up everything on the site?
[16:24:26] <ShawnRisk> gcpeters:The problem is that when click on the sublink it should go to another page, and than show the toplink highlights and the sublinks.  Yet it doesn't to do that, only when I click the top link it does that.
[16:25:18] <florence_> =/
[16:25:29] <gates> any ideas?
[16:25:43] <gcpeters> ShawnRisk: it's giving me 404 on the second page
[16:26:06] <ShawnRisk> gcpeters: yes because that is not a real page, it is an example.
[16:26:28] <ShawnRisk> gcpeters: I am using relative links there and in my dev site absolute links
[16:26:44] <gcpeters> gates: in your script you can just use the jQuery variable
[16:28:17] <gates> gcpeters: like this? dom.query = jQuery.noConflict(true);
[16:28:20] <florence_> any help?
[16:29:00] <gates> gcpeters: how do i know if i need to load jquery library?
[16:32:17] <ShawnRisk> gcpeters: do you understand what I am saying?
[16:33:48] <gcpeters> gates: if jQuery === undefined then jQuery isn't loaded, if you wrap your code in a self executing function you don't need to call noConflict, e.g. (function($) { $(document).ready(...);})(jQuery);
[16:34:05] <gcpeters> ShawnRisk: I don't think I do, sorry
[16:35:16] <ShawnRisk> gcpeters: I am not sure how to create an example that would work.  All I want to do is if you click any of the links, the top menu item for that is highlighted, and the submenu items show up.  Is that a better way to put this?
[16:35:22] <thinkerweb> I have a link: <a href="http://images.google.com/?q=porche" but when I follow it I reach google with the search term but not the results, you have to hit enter, how do I include enter in the url?
[16:36:24] <florence_> ShawnRisk:  u want something like this http://jsfiddle.net/xyRrF/29/
[16:37:24] <ShawnRisk> florence_: nope.  I want it so when you click the link, the topmenu item is highlighted and the submenu items show up.
[16:38:33] <ShawnRisk> florence_: the link could be a top menu item or the submenu item, but my original code works with the topmenu items but not the submenu items.
[16:40:00] <florence_> ShawnRisk:  u will have to setup a jsfiddle
[16:40:37] <ShawnRisk> okay let me try
[16:40:42] <gates> gcpeters: typeof(jQuery) == 'undefined'
[16:40:44] <gates> is that better?
[16:41:45] <gcpeters> gates: yeah
[16:45:14] <gates> gcpeters: is there documents on self executing?
[16:46:50] <ShawnRisk> florence_: I want something like this: http://designmodo.com/demo/jqueryaccordionmenu but if the sublinks go to another page, the topmenu item is highlighted and the sublinks stay open.
[16:46:53] <gcpeters> gates: yeah, you can google it, it's a common technique, but if it's something simple you can use jQuery like you use $, that maybe easier
[16:47:03] <ryanneufeld> gates: see ?iife
[16:47:04] <bot-t> gates, Immediately Invoked Function Expression: http://bit.ly/js-iife
[16:47:54] <gates> Thanks
[16:48:35] <ShawnRisk> florence_: does that help?  I mean it is a bit different to my situation but a little similar
[16:49:07] <gcpeters> my bad on the term

[16:54:46] <ShawnRisk> okay I think I am going to go as I can't figure out how to make a working example and no one understand me here
[17:27:20] <black_warlock> why it doesnt work  if($(this).has('ul li')){alert('yes has it');}else{alert('no hasnt it')};
[17:28:08] <black_warlock> need to verify the condition in which a <li> has <ul><li>
[17:30:04] <black_warlock> ?
[17:36:06] <HarryPitfall> .has('ul > li') isn't better?
[17:36:22] <HarryPitfall> and ul with at least one li as child
[17:36:50] <HarryPitfall> also, if($(this).find('ul > li').length) ...

[17:47:52] <Guest17980> does anyone see anything glaringly wrong with this ajax request? the success function is never called. http://jsfiddle.net/adamsilzell/jQdL4/
[17:49:52] <Kaltezar> Are you doing it cross-site ?
[17:50:14] <Guest17980> no, its local
[17:50:50] <Kaltezar> The HTML and JS are served on port 8080 ?
[17:52:32] <Guest17980> yea
[17:52:44] <Guest17980> It's trying to hit a tomcat server
[17:53:33] <Kaltezar> Did you try to simulate the request with curl ?
[17:57:08] <Guest17980> No, I'm not aware of curl
[17:57:13] <Guest17980> I'll look for that
[17:58:06] <black_warlock> florence_ what?
[17:58:19] <Guest17980> where do you get curl?
[17:58:56] <Kaltezar> Mmmh, on which OS are your ?

[18:03:51] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/acGRp/2/ please why this pop always yes it has it
[18:04:27] <black_warlock> i must find if the <li> has and <ul> with <li> inside
[18:04:39] <Kaltezar> Ok, so you should find a tool which allow you to simulate HTTP requests and check what the server is answering by simulating the AJAX request you send
[18:04:47] <Kaltezar> Maybe a tool like this one: http://soft-net.net/send-http-tool/

[18:06:02] <black_warlock> what is lenght ?
[18:06:07] <black_warlock> O.o
[18:06:11] <coldhead> it's the number of elements in the new set
[18:06:23] <coldhead> has() filters down the set to only the elements that match
[18:06:33] <coldhead> and if none of them match then length === 0
[18:06:35] <coldhead> which is falsy
[18:06:56] <coldhead> it's a common idiom, black_warlock. embrace it like a woman's love

[18:35:16] <Brooke> ejb: What do you mean? Like specifying an exact element?
[18:35:31] <ejb> i.e. $("meta[name="generator"][content^="WordPress"]")
[18:35:45] <ejb> w/o the quote conflict
[18:36:17] <ejb> I mean, based on two attributes of the tag
[18:36:18] <HarryPitfall> i believe that you can do in 2 steps
[18:36:46] <ejb> How?
[18:37:08] <HarryPitfall> $('meta[name=generator]').filter('[content^=WordPress])
[18:37:10] <HarryPitfall> $('meta[name=generator]').filter('[content^=WordPress]')
[18:37:35] <ejb> nvm, http://api.jquery.com/multiple-attribute-selector/
[18:37:40] <HarryPitfall> get all generator metas, and then filter
[18:38:43] <HarryPitfall> how, cool
[18:38:48] <HarryPitfall> a new trick!
[18:38:52] <HarryPitfall> :3 multiple selection
[18:39:10] <black_warlock> why the last function doesnt show the sub UL LI http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/acGRp/18/
[18:39:20] <black_warlock> onmouse over
[18:43:01] <chovy> can someone suggest a jquery library that will do autocomplete for tagging, much like stackoverflow uses?
[18:54:56] <coldhead> black_warlock: http://jsfiddle.net/acGRp/30/ ?
[18:55:35] <coldhead> i think you want find() instead of next() and your code was trying to select <ui> tags which i'm not sure are a thing
[18:55:56] <black_warlock> i did like this
[18:55:58] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/acGRp/29/
[18:56:15] <black_warlock> but hell this jq its impossible
[18:56:24] <black_warlock> every time things change
[18:57:19] <black_warlock> and why did you use show  .....
[18:57:23] <black_warlock> i dont understand
[18:57:32] <coldhead> because i am lazy, show() is less typing
[18:57:44] <black_warlock> im working with css changings
[18:57:56] <coldhead> show() changes css
[18:58:04] <cgcardona> checkbutt() nice
[18:58:11] <black_warlock> XD
[18:58:47] <black_warlock> i do it always on girls so it was nice to make a function in the name of it
[19:00:00] <black_warlock> it works
[19:00:06] <black_warlock> on your script also
[19:00:16] <black_warlock> i added $(this).find('ul').show(checkbutt());
[19:00:26] <black_warlock> and changed the sign
[19:00:33] <black_warlock> :P
[19:00:54] <coldhead> great job, let
[19:01:01] <coldhead> let's all take a 5 minute break
[19:02:46] <black_warlock> noooooooo
[19:02:51] <black_warlock> T_T
[19:03:42] <black_warlock> the checkbutt doesnt work on mouseout !!!! see ? it wanna stay always inside

[19:06:01] <chovy> i need a basic pattern for tagging something
[19:06:13] <black_warlock> tagging ?
[19:06:52] <chovy> I think i need to create a dropdown list of tags, when one is clicked, add that item to a visible list, and also adding it to a hidden field. When submit is triggered, send the hidden collection to the server.
[19:06:54] <black_warlock> o my gawd the bot search inside the jq website !
[19:07:42] <black_warlock> what do you use to register infos ? cookies ?
[19:08:53] <black_warlock> well thats not diffult to release
[19:09:27] <black_warlock> i must have something alreasy
[19:10:07] <black_warlock> watch this i used it for pictures
[19:10:21] <black_warlock> but should be fine  also for tags
[19:10:23] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/WFTVP/61/
[19:11:18] <black_warlock> you can set an html list and hidden input field 2
[19:11:30] <chovy> thanks
[19:12:06] <black_warlock> :P
[19:12:11] <chovy> so if i have an input field that i enter a tag in, and when they hit enter, it creates the tag in the ui...how do I handle the submit button?
[19:12:25] <chovy> both will get triggered.
[19:12:41] <chovy> i'm thinking i just have a <button> for saving the tags.
[19:12:45] <black_warlock> of course
[19:12:59] <black_warlock> register them all in a cookie
[19:13:02] <black_warlock> as preference
[19:13:14] <black_warlock> so when they come back will find their setting up
[19:14:05] <black_warlock> just set a function on button
[19:14:22] <black_warlock> .submit
[19:15:05] <chovy> k
[19:17:55] <black_warlock> add to the list  with left click remove from the list with right click thats funny
[19:32:36] <black_warlock> something like this
[19:32:41] <black_warlock> chovy http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/xrkdA/9/
[19:32:58] <HarryPitfall> I just hate <button> tags
[19:33:22] <HarryPitfall> <button> alone inside a form works exactly like <input type="submit">
[19:33:50] <HarryPitfall> I mean... button isn't just a button? to be clicked? standalone?
[19:34:37] <black_warlock> yep
[19:34:45] <black_warlock> it shoud not work in a form
[19:35:07] <black_warlock> if you dont attach .submit
[19:35:55] <HarryPitfall> afaik, if you use <button> inside a form
[19:36:03] <HarryPitfall> you need to use <button type="button">
[19:36:12] <HarryPitfall> a bit... WTF!
[19:42:44] <black_warlock> chovy
[19:42:48] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/xrkdA/14/
[19:43:13] <black_warlock> jere your map of tags
[19:44:22] <chovy> black_warlock: thanks
[19:44:39] <chovy> HarryPitfall: yeah. i noticed that as well. not sure why
[19:44:46] <chovy> they changed it in html5
[19:45:14] <black_warlock> hem
[19:45:16] <black_warlock> guys
[19:45:18] <HarryPitfall> basically, the button tag now can say the form action / method to submit the form
[19:45:32] <chovy> button has an action attribute?
[19:45:32] <black_warlock> you can give the aspect of a button to anything
[19:45:43] <HarryPitfall> so, you just have a blank <form>, and use two or more buttons to send the form to distinct actions
[19:45:54] <HarryPitfall> in html5, yes
[19:46:01] <HarryPitfall> button have action, method, etc...
[19:46:44] <black_warlock> just put the input submit and you will see the other butoons are indipendent
[19:47:44] <black_warlock> like when you put "submit" and "clear" form
[19:47:52] <chovy> this is news to me.
[19:47:57] <chovy> how well supported is it?
[19:48:14] <HarryPitfall> i don't know if it works
[19:48:20] <HarryPitfall> but i get a damn bug with it
[19:48:30] <black_warlock> show it
[19:48:46] <HarryPitfall> without the type="button"
[19:49:01] <HarryPitfall> i get the form submitted
[19:49:23] <HarryPitfall> I just remove the button, and changed to a std <a href="#"> with code attached
[19:49:51] <black_warlock> thats rite
[19:50:15] <black_warlock> you can also invent tags and give them the aspect of button
[19:50:24] <black_warlock> <butt></butt>
[19:51:36] <black_warlock> just remember this
[19:52:10] <black_warlock> if inside a form there isnt an input submit it will get the first button playable
[19:58:51] <dain> Test

[21:02:40] <EasyCo> Hey guys, quick one. I've been developing a jQuery widget using the widget factory. All is well except I've noticed that if I instantiate the widget more then once on any given page the last instantiation always overwrites any one preceeding it. It's my understanding that the widget factory took care of separating each instance in its own object. Is this right or am I tripping?
[21:13:54] <HarryPitfall> afaik, the widget creates a .data on the object to store the settings
[21:14:12] <EasyCo> Exactly
[21:14:24] <EasyCo> We'll I've dug a bit deeper and it is indeed working as it should but
[21:15:18] <EasyCo> I've got an object that gets assigned values and it's the specific object that doesn't seem to have more then one instance
[21:16:12] <EasyCo> The options object as defined in the widget does store a different version per dom.data() but not any other object
[21:25:36] <EasyCo> What am I missing here: http://jsfiddle.net/NrKVP/2/
[21:34:55] <dakta> Ok guys, I've got a doozie here: http://jsfiddle.net/kPMKu/
[21:36:39] <dakta> The purpose is to fade in a div (whose filler content may have to be loaded by ajax, but it's broken without that), then smoothly scroll the view to an anchor in that now-visible div.
[21:37:35] <dakta> Unfortunately, my test case isn't breaking the exactly same way my real page is breaking, just less dramatically.
[21:38:54] <dakta> http://jsfiddle.net/kPMKu/1/
[21:40:18] <dakta> EasyCo: uhm...
[21:41:52] <dakta> EasyCo: Looks like you've got a single instance of the widget being passed around instead of multiple instances being created...
[21:42:13] <EasyCo> dakta: So it seems
[21:42:25] * dakta doesn't know anything about jquery widgets
[21:42:51] <dakta> I wish my problem had such a simple test case...
[21:43:58] <EasyCo> dakta, what is the problem exacly
[21:44:03] <toothrot> i wonder why that doesn't write out to my firebug console
[21:45:32] <dakta> EasyCo: I've got some hidden content that I need to show then scroll to an anchor on. Seems simple, no?
[21:45:53] <EasyCo> Lemme have a looksee
[21:53:14] <dakta> EasyCo: uhm...
[21:53:21] <dakta> EasyCo: I found your problem.
[21:53:43] <dakta> EasyCo: What should be contained in an object called _global ?
[21:53:52] <EasyCo> Anything
[21:53:59] <dakta> EasyCo: Global stuff.
[21:54:18] <dakta> _glbl is global to every instance of the widget
[21:54:30] <EasyCo> dakta: That's just a random name I picked
[21:54:35] <EasyCo> Doesn't matter what it's called
[21:55:00] <dakta> Hmm?
[21:55:28] <dakta> oh wait, I misread my results...
[21:55:34] <dakta> hahahahaha, sorry EasyCo
[21:56:03] <dakta> my bad... what I get for writing things to the console and not indicating what they are in the .log
[21:56:45] <thinkerweb> any z-index scripts arounds?
[21:58:37] <dakta> EasyCo: wait a sec... http://jsfiddle.net/NrKVP/9/
[21:59:38] <dakta> EasyCo: Explain that, then. Looks like _glbl is actually shared by all widget instances.
[21:59:41] <EasyCo> http://jsfiddle.net/kPMKu/2/
[22:01:00] <dakta> EasyCo: hmm... it's still scrolling over, but what did you change?
[22:02:24] <EasyCo> dakta: Moved your location.hash = hash to the top
[22:02:26] <EasyCo> That's all
[22:02:56] <dakta> EasyCo: huh...
[22:03:22] <dakta> I'll try that change in my full page and see what happens
[22:06:17] <dakta> EasyCo: look at the console for this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/NrKVP/10/
[22:07:25] <EasyCo> Hmm, so basically as soon as it's nested it doesn't work.
[22:07:44] <gmclelland> This is probably really simple but I'm having a tough time understanding why this won't work.  If anyone could help, I would appreciate it. http://jsfiddle.net/gmclelland/MVLrT/
[22:07:58] <EasyCo> btw, you don't need to precede with a $ within a widget
[22:08:11] <EasyCo> So your var $this = this; is not neeed
[22:08:25] <gmclelland> When you click a tab it should open the panel and change the tab text to close with a close icon.
[22:08:26] <gmclelland> When you click the close icon it should revert the tab back to the original tab title.
[22:09:55] <EasyCo> gmclelland: You're only handling the situation for it to showtabclose
[22:10:23] <EasyCo> gmclelland: You need to toggle/detect its state then toggle the opposite
[22:10:26] <dakta> EasyCo: sorry, forgot to remove that, was testing a possible fix I found online for your problem.
[22:10:42] <EasyCo> dakta: No prob, just thought I'd tell ya
[22:11:08] <dakta> EasyCo: well, looks like my test case does not reflect my issue fully, since moving the location.hash line just breaks it slightly differently.
[22:11:25] <dakta> EasyCo: may I /msg ?
[22:11:42] <gmclelland> EasyCo Thanks, you mean use an if statement before it calls the toggle?
[22:17:15] <EasyCo> gmclelland: The problem is you need to store the initial state somewhere and currently you're just overwriting $tabText each time the button is clicked
[22:18:16] <gmclelland> EasyCo: that's sort of what I was thinking, but I'm not sure how get past it?
[22:18:39] <EasyCo> gmclelland: I think I'd use the .data() function
[22:18:48] <EasyCo> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
[22:19:17] <gmclelland> EasyCo: will look into that.  Thanks for the idea
[22:29:32] <thinkerweb> how do you manipulate z-index?
[22:30:04] <thinkerweb>  $(this).animate({ right: "0px"  }, 500); didn't work
[22:31:02] <EasyCo> $('.elem').css('z-index': '1000');
[23:08:04] <SP33D> Hello i am using lightbox for jquery it works normaly great

[23:09:16] <SP33D> any ideas what can cause that http://www.rasas-berlin.de/ ?
[23:09:41] <SP33D> i puted a click function in so it gets opened automaticly
