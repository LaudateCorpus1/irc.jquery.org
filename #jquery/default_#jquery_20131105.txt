[00:06:25] <Whiskey> pixelpimp: it won´t expend 3 of them in three diffrent widths
[00:06:30] <Whiskey> and have them equal sized
[00:08:26] <Serdar> okay I must set dom.disable_window_flip to false if this should work
[00:09:27] <Whiskey> Serdar? talk to me?
[00:13:22] <Whiskey> pixelpimp: i know why it don´t work the way i ask
[00:17:46] <Serdar> Whiskey, sorry, this was only an information about my problem before :)
[00:24:45] <grafi> whiskey how about you show some code/html oô
[00:30:02] <Whiskey> grafi: the code is here http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/bQR4d/4/
[00:30:33] <grafi> and you want to do what now?
[00:30:51] <Whiskey> you see in not work you have 1/2/3
[00:31:07] <Whiskey> the 1 should be equal sized whit the biggest 1 row and same gows for two and three
[00:31:16] <Whiskey> but them should not all be equal sized as the bigger
[00:31:19] <Whiskey> but them should not all be equal sized as the biggest
[00:33:15] <Whiskey> grafi: you get what i mean?
[00:33:21] <grafi> no :|
[00:33:30] <Whiskey> look at the first box
[00:33:33] <grafi> yup
[00:33:50] <Whiskey> you see that the last 3 is bigger then the first above
[00:33:54] <Whiskey> it should be same size
[00:34:22] <Whiskey> or if you look in the last box
[00:34:38] <Whiskey> the last 1 should set the size for first 1 / same gows for 2 and 3 as them are biggest
[00:34:47] <Whiskey> eqaul size
[00:34:55] <Whiskey> got it?
[00:35:23] <grafi> they are all equal width to me
[00:35:43] <Whiskey> impossible
[00:35:46] <Whiskey> give me a print screen
[00:35:51] <mr_c15> hello:)
[00:36:06] <Whiskey> what webbrowser do you use?
[00:36:22] <grafi> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/tables.JPG
[00:36:31] <grafi> we are talking about the 3 boxes, yes?
[00:36:38] <grafi> firefox
[00:36:55] <Whiskey> yeh you missing it
[00:36:59] <Whiskey> you need to click show baaa
[00:37:19] <Whiskey> thats why you don´t get it :D
[00:37:26] <Whiskey> its whats inside the box :D
[00:38:23] <grafi> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/tables_1.jpg like so?
[00:38:45] <Whiskey> yeh
[00:38:51] <Whiskey> thats the rows i want equal sized :)
[00:39:38] <grafi> so 1 and 2 would be bigger
[00:39:43] <grafi> in the second box
[00:40:08] <mr_c15> Can someone tell me what is wrog? Because when I append jquery 1.10.2 and jQuery Migrate 1.2.1 by http://someadresse.com I get an error "TypeError: e.attrHooks is undefined" in file jQuery Migrate but when I append the very same files with path like: "../js/libs/jQuery/jqueryFile.js" then everything is ok
[00:40:20] <Whiskey> the border show the size
[00:40:38] <Whiskey> the border should be same for the 1s and then for 2s and 3s so it 3 sizes it need to calculate
[00:41:22] <grafi> now you lost me ^^
[00:41:46] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/bQR4d/3/ <-- look at that
[00:41:52] <Whiskey> the first box show how it should look
[00:42:03] <grafi> sure
[00:42:35] <Whiskey> "#one {width: 86px;}/#two {width: 118px;}/#three {width: 126px;}" <-- that what i set in CSS you got it it 3 diffrent sizes for eatch number
[00:44:17] <Whiskey> so the biggest in one was 86 in two 118 and in three 126 <- thats what jQuery needs to find out
[00:45:00] <grafi> so why not do that?
[00:45:03] <grafi> :O
[00:45:35] <grafi> sounds to me like you just want to look at each column, see how wide it is and pick the biggest?
[00:45:45] <Serdar> how can I get the firefox/IE Icon blinking if a dialogbox opens?
[00:45:58] <Whiskey> yeh
[00:45:59] <grafi> Serdar ugh
[00:46:03] <Whiskey> correct
[00:46:04] <Serdar> in the taskbar I mean
[00:46:15] <grafi> Whiskey but that should be easy, what do you need help for?
[00:46:15] <Whiskey> grafi, i have no clue how you do that thats why :D
[00:46:23] <grafi> Serdar taskbar oô
[00:46:28] <Serdar> grafi, I tried something like window.focus(); but this didn't work :/
[00:46:44] <grafi> Serdar just dont :P
[00:46:53] <Serdar> it worked if I tried myWindow = window.open.. mywindow.focus();
[00:46:59] <Whiskey> grafi, i suck at jQuer
[00:47:23] <Serdar> grafi, how should I know that a new dialogbox appeared in one tab if I don't?
[00:47:27] <grafi> prime opportunity to learn Whiskey :P
[00:47:51] <grafi> Serdar why would you want to annoy the user if hes i not currently viewing the page?
[00:48:09] <grafi> its like playing sound-ads
[00:48:12] <grafi> *shivers*
[00:48:37] <Whiskey> grafi, is where you come in to the picure :)
[00:48:37] <Serdar> because he needs to accept or deny.
[00:48:38] <Serdar> and that fast.
[00:48:44] <grafi> Whiskey to teach you how to do it yourself :P
[00:49:12] <grafi> why oô
[00:49:45] <Serdar> somebody must accept it and that fast.
[00:49:57] <grafi> WHY
[00:49:57] <grafi> :D
[00:50:19] <Serdar> loosing time. if it is not accepted fast, I loose time :)
[00:50:34] <Whiskey> grafi, i have tryto lurn jQuery sometimes i use it so little so it would take me ages :)
[00:51:01] <Serdar> that's why I was looking for a popup which appears in front, no matter what the client does.
[00:51:19] <grafi> lets hope i have to never use that website
[00:51:26] <koneko> lol
[00:51:38] <Serdar> sure you don't. this is an intranet applciation
[00:51:49] <Serdar> why should I offer you something?
[00:52:35] <Serdar> I am already using an application like this but it is old using php and mysql and refreshs. I rewrite it to use websockets :)
[00:52:54] <Whiskey> grafi, just the code that are in the JS in the example is hard to understand :)
[00:53:25] <grafi> Whiskey is it working then?
[00:54:14] <koneko> Serdar, even if you get the icon to blink on Windows when something opens, I'm not sure how will it work on OS X and Linux, anyway - that's OS-specific, not a jQuery feature
[00:54:38] <Serdar> nobody is using something else than windows here.
[00:54:57] <koneko> Then just the last part of my message applies
[00:54:58] <grafi> its probably still not jquery specific
[00:55:05] <Serdar> I only need to cover IE, FF and chrome, that's all
[00:55:33] <koneko> It's not a jQuery feature to make a browser icon blink
[00:55:49] <Whiskey> yeh its wroking fine :)
[00:56:26] <grafi> Whiskey if its working what are we trying to do? :P
[00:57:18] <koneko> Serdar, you might use the notifications API, like when a new message gets to your Gmail inbox you get one, if you allowed the site to use them.
[00:57:24] <Whiskey> no i not that i asked fore
[00:57:28] <Serdar> then I don't understand why it works with when I do: var mywindow = window.open...; mywindow.focus(); but not with openDialogFunction(); window.focus(); or to ask different: is the dialogbox a window itself or a part of the whole page?
[00:57:39] <Whiskey> i have no clue how to build a function like that
[00:57:53] <grafi> Serdar http://alxgbsn.co.uk/notify.js/
[00:58:15] <koneko> Serdar, grafi or http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/notifications/quick/
[00:58:33] <grafi> koneko which is deprecated :P
[00:58:39] <grafi> :D
[00:58:47] <koneko> Oh, sorry!
[00:58:54] <grafi> thats what lead me to notify.js though
[00:58:55] <grafi> :P
[00:59:01] <Whiskey> i was hope i culd use "// JavaScript Table-Width" for that two, but it won´t work
[00:59:06] <koneko> I need to update my links
[00:59:10] <Serdar> is the article depricated or the whole api?
[00:59:17] <Serdar> err
[00:59:21] <Serdar> sorry learn to read
[00:59:50] <koneko> But then MDNS should be up to date: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/notification
[01:00:01] <Serdar> notify.js does not work with IE :/
[01:00:29] <grafi> i bet you are using ie 6 :D
[01:00:44] <koneko> Yeah, it doesn't
[01:00:45] <Serdar> no 10
[01:00:55] <Serdar> but it looks great on chrome
[01:00:59] <koneko> But it's the only thing you can really control with JS
[01:01:13] <grafi> well, you could maybe change the page title
[01:01:20] <grafi> that should be visible
[01:01:24] <grafi> if the tab is open
[01:03:57] <Whiskey> grafi, it would take me month to slove, not even sure i won´t lurn how to do it
[01:04:22] <grafi> not with that attitude
[01:04:24] <grafi> :P
[01:04:56] <Whiskey> well i know how useless i am on coding as i have do it for 6 years soon
[01:06:16] <koneko> Whiskey, gotta start 'lurnin' then
[01:06:47] <koneko> There's a whole lot of free online courses
[01:07:01] <Whiskey> yeh i have try someone of them some month ago did not do well
[01:07:13] <Whiskey> and i don´t lurn stuff i almost never use ether
[01:10:02] <Whiskey> try to google after a slotion but thats not easy ether
[01:17:13] <Whiskey> var theWidth = $("table").eq(0).find("tr > td:first").width(); $("table:gt(0)").find("tr > td:first").width(theWidth + "px"); <-- something like that should work
[01:23:30] <grafi> looks weird Whiskey :P
[01:24:35] <Whiskey> yeh thats why i need help :/
[01:25:46] <grafi> Whiskey http://jsfiddle.net/bQR4d/5/
[01:27:58] <Whiskey> that can´t be correct
[01:28:02] <Whiskey> what does that apply to?
[01:29:04] <Doqnach> Hey all, I have an issue with the jQueryUI themeroller where I can't download a custom theme (tried Opera/Firefox/Chrome) http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/#!zThemeParams=5d00000100ba05000000000000003d8888d844329a8dfe02723de3e5700bbb34ecf36ce5959f380e613cafa997b39424a52ffca05194f1d1c3e077aa4ac96e92487a70544631007f40870d1cc797e14f5bc62d0e72900510e0155843ac91ed052eae417c0cfdf1bf9a82654c50ab60b03412df948ee66accf7238e22c3853206fb2965c51179f0ff75527b62b05afbd3e3aa9
[01:32:46] <Whiskey> grafi: I have no clue how you have think whit that one as nothing work
[01:33:26] <grafi> works
[01:33:28] <grafi> ôo
[01:34:04] <Whiskey> not for me
[01:35:52] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/bQR4d/6/ <-- on that one
[01:36:05] <Whiskey> wtf
[01:36:40] <seutje> is that show button supposed to do something else every time you click it? o.O
[01:37:54] <Whiskey> http://oi43.tinypic.com/2m7tfo9.jpg <-- grafi are them equal sized in the box?
[01:38:48] <Whiskey> http://postimg.org/image/7gvhflvnf/full/ <--- that image are batter
[01:39:11] <Whiskey> grafi, not working last box is still unchanged
[01:39:23] <ndeeah> has anyone ever had problems with smoothdivcroll? it keeps scrolling very very very quickly to the right of the div whenever i hover over the right arrow
[01:39:33] <ndeeah> whereas when i hover over the left one it scrolls normally
[01:40:49] <Whiskey> grafi: or you most have miss understand me
[01:43:03] <Whiskey> grafi: http://postimg.org/image/rnuroeicl/full/ <-- look at that image
[01:44:11] <grafi> Whiskey slashing it up into what you already have will fuck things up ...
[01:44:23] <grafi> i see the old code you had in there ...
[01:44:39] <grafi> so thats not good
[01:44:59] <Whiskey> no we talk about the size on the tds inside the boxes
[01:45:02] <Whiskey> not size on the tables
[01:45:07] <grafi> then it seems to be buggy on its own still, when toggling the different tables, no idea how to fix that yet
[01:45:11] <Whiskey> what you changed was size on everything
[01:45:19] <grafi> when the tds grow, the tables grow also
[01:45:28] <Whiskey> the tds should not grow
[01:45:30] <grafi> i change the size of the cells
[01:45:33] <Whiskey> you see in the first image it works fine
[01:45:36] <grafi> the tds should not grow?
[01:45:49] <Whiskey> thats max width it need for that text
[01:45:49] <grafi> surely the tds have to grow
[01:45:51] <grafi> ...
[01:46:23] <grafi> [09:45:33] <grafi> sounds to me like you just want to look at each column, see how wide it is and pick the biggest?
[01:46:31] <grafi> thats exactly what that does
[01:46:32] <grafi> oô
[01:47:14] <Whiskey> yeh in three diffrent sizes as i told, but that won´t matter know its still get to big
[01:48:08] <Whiskey> not so bad at all
[01:49:13] <Whiskey> wonder why the border won´t fallow
[01:51:07] <YSY> Hi Guys, I'm trying to use the jquery-ui team's menu widget as an ipod\drilldown menu and there's no explanation on should I do it
[01:51:23] <YSY> on how should I do it*
[01:52:10] <Whiskey> there you go
[01:52:11] <grafi> Whiskey one problem of course is that we calculate with of a cell, but the amount of columns vries
[01:52:18] <YSY> the wiki page mentions it is possible while the API doesn't
[01:52:29] <grafi> that has to be taken into consideration
[01:56:52] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/bQR4d/9/ <-- grafi that is more correct
[01:56:57] <Whiskey> works perfect almost
[01:57:49] <grafi> then use it :p
[01:58:14] <Whiskey> grafi it only that you missad one detail
[01:59:41] <YSY> can someone please help me?
[02:00:00] <Whiskey> strange worked fine now hmm
[02:00:47] <Whiskey> its pefect thx alot grafi :)
[02:01:11] <grafi> np
[02:01:11] <YSY> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137997/Menu

[02:03:26] <grafi> YSY http://jamesarosen.github.io/jquery-ui/demos/menu/ios-menu.html like that?
[02:04:05] <YSY> yes, but the sliding is not very smove here
[02:05:03] <YSY> http://www.filamentgroup.com/examples/menus/ - see last demo
[02:05:18] <YSY> they moved the entire project to the jquery ui team
[02:06:04] <YSY> it seems on git that no one changed anything in the last 2 years
[02:06:15] <grafi> and thats not good?
[02:06:25] <grafi> if you want it use it, if not dont?
[02:06:40] <YSY> it doesn't work as described in the wiki
[02:06:48] <grafi> why not?
[02:07:01] <grafi> its slides and you can go back ...
[02:07:14] <YSY> the functionalists described doesn't work (breadcrumbs etc').
[02:07:53] <grafi> it does though
[02:07:55] <grafi> ...
[02:08:00] <YSY> 	◦	show a full breadcrumb in place of the back link
[02:08:01] <YSY> 	◦	change the location of the back link (above vs. below the menu)
[02:08:01] <YSY> 	◦	change the default back text (from "Back" to something else)
[02:08:01] <YSY> 	◦	set default breadcrumb text (i.e., "Choose an option:")
[02:08:01] <YSY> 	◦	select wether the menu should be context loaded, drop down or statically rendered
[02:10:14] <YSY> grafi?
[02:10:34] <grafi> what of those doesnt work?
[02:10:42] <grafi> works in the demo you provided
[02:10:43] <grafi> ...
[02:10:48] <YSY> breadcrumbs
[02:11:21] <grafi> but that works fine
[02:11:56] <YSY> where do you see it?
[02:12:04] <YSY> you are suppose to see it in the upper part
[02:12:08] <YSY> the path
[02:12:48] <grafi> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/bcs.JPG
[02:13:23] <YSY> you are looking on another project
[02:13:26] <Whiskey> grafi, i got one more problem
[02:13:38] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/bQR4d/12/ <-- in that one the first javascript it applays to all TDs right?
[02:13:38] <YSY> this is not the jquery ui menu widget
[02:13:45] <grafi> YSY i am looking at a link you provided oô
[02:15:11] <grafi> Whiskey what?
[02:15:44] <Whiskey> $(document).ready(function () {
[02:15:44] <Whiskey> var children=$("table:first").eq(0).find("td");
[02:15:50] <Whiskey> it applays to all TDs right
[02:15:55] <Whiskey> not just that table
[02:16:50] <seutje> heh
[02:17:01] <Whiskey> as it set the width for the TDs
[02:17:02] <seutje> $("table:first").eq(0) <- isn't that a bit silly?
[02:17:07] <seutje> the first of the first
[02:17:28] <Whiskey> i just played whit it
[02:17:31] <seutje> which is, by definition, the first of all... $('table').eq(0)
[02:17:35] <grafi> seutje yes :P
[02:17:51] <Whiskey> but still it will set all TDs to that width right
[02:17:51] <grafi> Whiskey it only finds tds in the first table
[02:17:52] <grafi> ._.
[02:18:03] <Whiskey> yeh :) but still set the width gloval
[02:18:04] <grafi> when you select all tds oô
[02:18:10] <seutje> the first of the first, actually
[02:18:11] <grafi> if not, then no
[02:18:12] <grafi> ...
[02:18:29] <seutje> I feel a highlander quote coming up for some reason
[02:18:29] <grafi> frist under equals?
[02:18:29] <grafi> :P
[02:18:32] <Whiskey> so how do i close so it only set width on the TDs in first table, set it to a class name maybe
[02:19:14] <seutje> $('table').eq(0).find('td').css('width', someNumber)
[02:19:31] <seutje> unless ur nesting tables and don't consider the nested ones as part of the first table
[02:21:34] <Whiskey> thats alot batter thx
[02:22:27] <seutje> love me a lot of batter
[02:24:57] <Whiskey> thx alot everyone for your time that sloved alot of problems
[02:27:39] <Whiskey> perfect
[02:49:25] <vsgill> anyone around?
[02:50:17] <Cork> ?ask
[02:50:18] <wodim> no
[02:50:18] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:50:33] <vsgill> :)
[02:50:40] <grafi> Cork gave it away
[02:50:41] <grafi> -.-
[02:50:52] <vsgill> I'm trying to create a nav menu with slidedown and push content, similar to this -> http://wellington.govt.nz/
[02:51:14] <vsgill> anyone know the best route? Is there one already out there, so should I just code it?
[02:53:27] <rivarun> hey #jquery. i have a couple of input elements that propagate changes to each other and an .on('change', ...) handler for one of the elements. i want the handler to fire even when the changes happens with .val() . here's a demonstration with more a readable description http://jsfiddle.net/ELb9z/1/
[02:55:55] <Cork> rivarun: no events fire when the browser changes something or the user does it
[02:56:06] <Cork> rivarun: when you do it in code you need to keep track of it your self
[02:56:24] <rivarun> Cork: that's what i figured. how would you go about doing that?
[02:56:40] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/ELb9z/2/
[02:58:22] <rivarun> Cork: oh. that's exactly what i was hoping for. but now i don't get any alerts for any change. do you?
[02:59:17] <slax0r> I get an Aw. Snap! from chrome :P
[02:59:21] <Cork> i didn't before either
[02:59:53] <rivarun> i do get them in my example when i change the second input
[03:00:14] <Cork> i get an error
[03:01:02] <rivarun> "too much recursion" is what firefox says
[03:01:31] <rivarun> which makes sense considering we're inside on('change',
[03:01:50] <Cork> ah, ya the first one is for change on the same element
[03:04:37] <Whiskey> i don´t get it
[03:04:59] <rivarun> well, i have to leave for a few hours and this is a low priority feature. i'll see if i can refactor the entire thing later. thanks Cork
[03:05:43] <Cork> and jsfiddle looks like it's taking a crap again...
[03:06:52] <Whiskey> -// JavaScript ReSizeBox -> jsfiddle.net/bQR4d/14/ -> that one are supose to resize the rows in table to same wdith but it dosen´t

[03:25:43] <__equinox>  window.addEventListener("load", setTimeout(performInitialSetup(), 10000), false);
[03:25:55] <__equinox> the 2nd one calls performInitialSetup() right away
[03:25:57] <Cork> uh, none of those should work saftly
[03:26:16] <Cork> your giving a timer id to an event listener
[03:26:17] <__equinox> hmmm
[03:26:28] <__equinox> so what is the best way then?
[03:26:30] <Cork> window.addEventListener("load", function() { setTimeout(function(){ performInitialSetup(); }, 10000) }, false);
[03:26:38] <__equinox> got it
[03:26:45] <Cork> window.addEventListener("load", function() { setTimeout(performInitialSetup, 10000) }, false);
[03:26:51] <Cork> those should both work
[03:27:12] <Cork> though why do you need to delay it from the load event?
[03:30:17] <__equinox> alright
[03:30:21] <__equinox> well that's the next question
[03:30:28] <__equinox> I wanted to do performinitialSetup
[03:30:35] <__equinox> when jQuery has been downloaded
[03:30:42] <__equinox> is there an event listener to do that
[03:32:29] <lianzinho> guys, I have an accordion, and would like to link to one of the entries such as when the user gets to the page, thus specific entry appears opened. Any general idea on how I could do that?
[03:33:21] <__equinox> anyone?
[03:34:42] <Cork> __equinox: if you load jquery async, you would have to depend on a third party to tell you when it is loaded
[03:34:58] <__equinox> Cork: if not?
[03:35:15] <Cork> then it is loaded on the next script in the page
[03:35:26] <Cork> no need to wait for an event
[03:35:51] <__equinox> here's how I am loading it at the moment
[03:35:56] <__equinox>   var element = document.createElement("script");
[03:36:04] <__equinox>  element.src = jQueryUrl;
[03:36:04] <Cork> that means async
[03:36:08] <__equinox> document.body.appendChild(element);
[03:36:13] <__equinox> yes
[03:36:20] <__equinox> so then do I just fire an event listener
[03:36:22] <__equinox> or?
[03:36:26] <Cork> element.onload = function() { alert('loaded'); }; appendChild()
[03:36:32] <Cork> no
[03:36:34] <Cork> no event listener
[03:36:47] <__equinox> well I want to have an eventListener
[03:37:17] <__equinox> is there a way
[03:37:25] <__equinox> so I have a listener that listens to this
[03:37:30] <Cork> well i guess you could do element.addEventListener('load', function() { alert('loaded'); })
[03:37:36] <Cork> though it is basically the same in this case
[03:37:52] <Cork> but you can't use jquery for obvious reasons
[03:38:03] <__equinox> no I mean
[03:38:07] <__equinox> instead of alert('loaded');
[03:38:13] <__equinox> I wanted to trigger an event
[03:38:14] <Cork> also remember that is you use addEventListner you need to use attachEvent for ie
[03:38:23] <Cork> __equinox: huh?
[03:38:58] <__equinox> okay, to make it more clear
[03:39:00] <__equinox> I have this
[03:39:03] <__equinox>   window.addEventListener("load", performInitialSetup(), false);
[03:39:07] <__equinox> but instead of 'load'
[03:39:10] <Cork> you can't do that
[03:39:19] <__equinox> I want this event to say 'when jQuery has loaded'
[03:39:22] <Cork> that will execute performInitialSetup() directoy
[03:39:28] <Cork> *directly
[03:39:49] <Cork> you need to pass a function reference to addEventListener if you want it to be a callback
[03:40:04] <Cork> (i said so before)
[03:40:19] <__equinox> but this is on a different file
[03:40:25] <__equinox> hence why I want to use listeners
[03:40:54] <Cork> ...
[03:41:07] <Cork> functionName() will execute the function
[03:41:10] <Cork> no matter when it is call
[03:41:12] <Cork> 'ed
[03:41:24] <Cork> you need to pass it as a reference and that is functionName
[03:41:28] <__equinox> okay
[03:41:31] <__equinox> so I have this
[03:41:35] <__equinox> window.addEventListener("load", function() { performInitialSetup(); }, false);
[03:41:40] <Cork> eh...
[03:41:44] <__equinox> instead of the event 'load'
[03:41:50] <__equinox> i want this performInitialSetup
[03:41:51] <Cork> window.addEventListener("load", performInitialSetup, false);
[03:41:51] <__equinox> to be fired
[03:41:59] <__equinox> when jQuery is finished downloaded
[03:42:10] <__equinox> I guess that's the main question
[03:42:12] <__equinox> how do I do that
[03:42:20] <Cork> as you are dynamically loading it after the fact it won't be included in the load event
[03:42:41] <Cork> your better of moving it to the callback form the script you inject
[03:42:51] <Cork> else you will trigger the code twice
[03:42:56] <__equinox> alright
[03:42:58] <Cork> once for the page and once for the script
[03:43:11] <__equinox> so replace that alert
[03:43:13] <__equinox> with  function() { performInitialSetup(); }
[03:43:15] <__equinox> right?
[03:43:27] <Cork> ...
[03:43:32] <Cork> are you even reading the responses?
[03:43:33] <Cork> NO
[03:44:02] <__equinox> I am reading the responses....
[03:44:07] <__equinox> what do you mean?
[03:44:16] <__equinox> so I should just do something like this right
[03:44:17] <__equinox>  element.onload = function() { performInitialSetup(); };
[03:44:21] <Cork> i've answered that question 3 times, and you are still not seeing it
[03:44:32] <Cork> element.onload = performInitialSetup;
[03:44:48] <__equinox> okay
[03:44:55] <__equinox> element.onload = performInitialSetup; it is
[03:45:09] <Cork> if you want to send a function as a reference
[03:45:12] <Cork> don't execute it
[03:45:19] <Cork> that means no ()
[03:45:35] <__equinox> I want to execute this performInitialSetup
[03:46:55] <slax0r> no you don't
[03:47:03] <slax0r> you want it executed when some element loads
[03:52:23] <__equinox> I want to execute this when jQuery has been loaded
[03:53:56] <__equinox> basically element.onload = performInitialSetup;  does not do anything right?
[03:53:59] <__equinox> Cork: ?
[03:55:35] <Cork> __equinox: it binds a callback for when the script has been loaded
[03:55:42] <Cork> and that is what you said you wanted
[03:55:53] <__equinox> I don't understand....
[03:56:10] <Cork> you wanted the function called when the jquery script was loaded
[03:56:12] <3JTAAMJAY> Hi all, I am creating dynamically add draggable using jquery. Here is the code http://pastebin.com/nfcsbaFc. I can add draggable frame dynamically. But only 1st frame set to draggable, next frames created after that are non draggable. i was following this example http://jsfiddle.net/Ty8uZ/5/
[03:56:35] <__equinox> yes..
[03:56:58] <__equinox> and element.onload = performInitialSetup; will call performInitialSetup when jQuery has been loaded?
[03:57:17] <Cork> it will be called when the script element.src is pointing to has been loaded
[03:57:36] <slax0r> I think he's loading it with <script>
[03:57:43] <Cork> yes
[03:57:52] <Cork> the element name "element" was from his code
[03:57:53] <__equinox> alright
[03:57:56] <Cork> he posted it a bit up
[03:58:07] <fuchstronaut> my event (onClick on <a>) reads the url hash, but it is too fast, the code is executed before the hash changes. any ideas how to fix that?
[03:58:08] <slax0r> oh, I didn't see it
[03:58:11] <slax0r> I'll shut up :P
[04:00:54] <mkoks> hey, I dont understand such fancybox behaviour:
[04:01:11] <mkoks> oh, damn enter.
[04:01:36] <Cork> fuchstronaut: you most likely want to listen to hashchange instead of click
[04:01:48] <fuchstronaut> yep, but how?
[04:01:52] <Cork> fuchstronaut: cause click will be on the url click not that the hash is changed
[04:01:56] <Cork> ?mdn hashChange
[04:01:57] <b-ot> Cork: hashchange - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/hashchange

[04:03:39] <hermiene> I have this: http://pastebin.com/6GHxh4x2
[04:04:32] <hermiene> My problem is that I'm using the id variable to do stuff to an array, but sometimes the value falls out of bounds. console.log()-ing the id reveals that once in a blue moon I'm getting an empty string back.
[04:05:18] <hermiene> Right now I'm doing a typeof check to see that array[id] != 'undefined', which works ok, but I'd like to know why this happens.

[04:07:24] <mkoks> so I have images gallery based on fancybox and some jquery and my problem is that when I am switching images inside fancybox (usual interface with 'left', 'right' arrows) and new image has loaded instead of previous one fancybox does not fit to image size (which is fine I guess) but it does when I open chrome dev tools for example? Why so?

[04:19:55] <ArSn> hi
[04:20:13] <ArSn> is there a common way to extend a given jquery plugin? (which I don't want to edit)
[04:20:26] <mkoks> SuperTyp, you can also replace picbool == false with simple !picbool
[04:21:02] <ArSn> I read stuff about $.extend(true, $[ namespace ][ pluginname ].prototype, extensionMethods); ... in Order to do that, but what would be the "namespace" for a function that is set to $.fn. ?
[04:36:12] <ph88> is it possible to get the response body in a 4** status code ajax request ?
[04:47:19] <seutje> ph88: u can access the entire jqXHR object in the error handler
[05:18:59] <Lee989> Hi all, Quick Q. I want to take an element and get a "value" from it. If its a form style element then use .val(), otherwise use .text() ... hows best to achieve this? I could get all form element names from w3c and create a huge listof $(this).is('elementtype') to use in an if condition.... but that seems a little overkill. Is there a way to check if val() is a valid method on a given element?
[05:20:14] <Clorith> just check if .val() returns anything, if not fallback to .text() ?
[05:21:43] <Lee989> i thought about that, since val() doesnt error. And the same with text() on form ele's just returns an empty string. It just felt "dirty", however if there's no other suggestions, i'll just go with it
[05:21:54] <Lee989> i need to stop being so anal about my programming :P
[05:24:49] <blewp> I have two, arrays, one with a list of all available items, and one with a list of all the users choosen items.. if i wanted to return a new array of available items with the choosen items removed, what would the best approach be?
[05:27:14] <vsgill> I have a hover event on a div, but when I hover out sideways or up it doesn't trigger my function
[05:27:28] <_rgn> blewp: you'd use _.without with underscore
[05:27:29] <vsgill> it does however when I move it out of the div from the bottom
[05:27:53] <vsgill> any idea?
[05:33:54] <Cork> vsgill: are you using mouseenter/mouseleave or hover ?
[06:03:30] <FernandoBasso> If I have var f = $('#form'); how can I get f.email, where 'email' is the 'name' attribute of the field?
[06:03:59] <Cork> f.find('[name="email"]')
[06:04:08] <FernandoBasso> I know I can do f[0].email. But what if I want f.email.hide() (I ge an error).
[06:05:27] <FernandoBasso> Okay, that will work then.
[06:06:17] <FernandoBasso> Cork: Thanks.

[06:07:34] <son> On a page with google analytics, there's a sample pixel looking like: http://www.google-analytics.com/__utm.gif?utmwv=0.0.0&utms=9999&utmn=123456789&utmhn=&something&something
[06:08:01] <son> I tried to query for that with jQuery("img[src*='google-analytics']")
[06:08:04] <Cork> that's a web bug
[06:08:16] <son> and got empty result
[06:08:21] <son> Why? :-(
[06:08:33] <Cork> ya, it is meant so you can track users with js disabled
[06:08:45] <Cork> they track them through the loading of that file instead
[06:09:49] <son> OK, still can I know why I could not query it with the syntax: jQuery("img[src*='google-analytics']") ?
[06:10:10] <Cork> you should
[06:11:58] <StanAccy> if I bind a click handler to an element, and then replace the target element with another element of the same ID, will the click handler still be bound, or is the association lost?
[06:12:30] <Cork> the event listener is added to the element
[06:12:45] <Cork> so if you remove the element all event listeners added to that element will be lost too
[06:13:05] <Cork> StanAccy: to clearify where you prob do the mistake
[06:13:08] <StanAccy> Cork: ok, thanks.  So Id need to use the on('click',selector,fn); variant
[06:13:22] <Cork> $() find elements .on() or .bind() or the rest loops that list of elements and do there work
[06:13:41] <Cork> StanAccy: then they will be around as long as the element you delegate the event listener to is around
[06:13:42] <StanAccy> Cork: I dont follow
[06:14:08] <Cork> StanAccy: $('selector') finds elements that matches that selector and builds an array of them
[06:14:16] <StanAccy> yep
[06:14:20] <Cork> what you run after that loops those elements
[06:14:43] <Cork> .on() or .bind() or .animate or so on
[06:14:50] <Cork> they don't do any searches them self
[06:15:05] <StanAccy> unless you uyse the 3 arg form of on() ?
[06:15:54] <Cork> no
[06:15:54] <Cork> that just means the event listener added to the target element
[06:15:54] <Cork> will look if event.target in the event matches the selector you pass to on
[06:15:54] <hugkid6> is there a way to use jquery and css to make an object rotate when it is clicked? I am fairly new and I don't know quite how to do it
[06:16:08] <Cork> the event is still on the element $() found
[06:16:23] <Cork> hugkid6: you only need css
[06:16:28] <StanAccy> yeh butn ormally when using the 3 arg form, you put that on() on something like the body
[06:16:45] <Cork> .rotate-me:active { transform: rotate(180deg); }
[06:17:07] <hugkid6> Cork: the thing isn't a link though, and I want it to animate
[06:17:09] <Cork> StanAccy: well no, but you add it to a static parent
[06:17:22] <Cork> hugkid6: well my point is you can do that with css3
[06:17:40] <Cork> hugkid6: and no you can't rotate elements without css3
[06:17:43] <hugkid6> Cork: but can you animate a css transform? And is it compatible cross-browser
[06:17:44] <Cork> except through <canvas>
[06:18:03] <Cork> hugkid6: it is cross browsers, if you accept new browsers
[06:18:23] <hugkid6> Cork: I do, users might not though
[06:18:40] <Cork> hugkid6: my point is you can't do it without it anyway
[06:18:51] <Cork> except in <canvas> like i said
[06:18:57] <Cork> and those are about the same limitations
[06:19:25] <Cork> you would have to resort to rastered gifs or similar if you want support for older browsers
[06:19:30] <Cork> (or flash)
[06:27:18] <StanAccy> Cork: Is there a way to detect orphaned click handlers like this?
[06:53:38] <__equinox> are there any other jQuery lazy load library aside from this one? https://github.com/tuupola/jquery_lazyload‎

[07:11:03] <antoon> Greetings lads
[07:15:52] <antoon> I'm having some trouble using jquery.animate() with the options { right: xxpx }, it simply doesn't animate at all
[07:16:15] <crash_> Hello, can anyone help me with the datepicker widget?  I had it working on a form field, but I've changed the form contents to be generated from an external javascript page, and now the datepicker won't work on it
[07:20:21] <antoon> http://jsfiddle.net/Ugj8L/1/ - when it triggers the effect for "right", it doesn't animate at all. But all the other ones work (left, top). Any ideas? :<
[07:24:31] <intellix> I know this is isn't particular to jQuery but it's a general frontend question.... using a custom font (TexGyreAdventor) and it doesn't seem to be centred vertically... is there something extra I should do with font-face to perhaps make it normal like the other fonts?
[07:25:55] <intellix> not sure if the issue is particular to Mac, but have it on a button but it's not quite centred properly -.-
[07:27:52] <intellix> it's like the glyphs are above the normal line, so they never centre properly vertically with anything
[07:28:33] <Erneston> hi
[07:29:17] <Jon47> intellix - you can try messing with line height but it might just be a peculiarity of that font..
[07:30:33] <intellix> damn.... I don't understand what it is with fonts..... thousands of £ in royalties and it's like it's a rocket science :P
[07:31:18] <Erneston> i have a concept but am not sure how easy it is to do
[07:31:34] <Erneston> typeface design is a science
[07:32:38] <jedimind> its an art!
[07:33:07] <Erneston> jedi can i get some help from you today
[07:33:07] <intellix> I don't know how to create fonts, but I'm sure it's easy enough to align them perfectly central
[07:33:09] <Erneston> :p
[07:33:27] <intellix> it's like they were just thrown in, completely out of centre
[07:33:54] <Erneston> depends on who made it
[07:33:58] <Erneston> anyone can make a 'font'
[07:36:58] <Serdar> hi I am using the tablesort plugin for jquery and got a strange effect
[07:37:32] <Serdar> if I predefine entries in my table, the sorting works well
[07:38:38] <Serdar> but if I add entries dynamically with .innerHTML += <tr> ...</tr> this does not work
[07:38:46] <Serdar> althrough they can be seen on page
[07:38:49] <Serdar> but not sorted
[07:46:00] <progman> I am looking for someone to make an html5/jquery timeline ui interface for me.  Please PM if interested
[07:51:08] <Erneston> there are website which do this for free
[07:55:03] <Tingle> If im using jquery - or almost only jquery inside a .js file - do I prefix the file with jquery.main.js for example?
[07:55:21] <Tingle> or is the jquery prefix for external plugins/libs that one uses made from jquery?
[07:56:13] <slax0r> up for you to decide, it's really just a filename
[07:56:35] <_rgn> Tingle: yes, for the latter question
[07:56:36] <Tingle> well I feel some kind of standard, all the plugins ive seen use that prefix
[07:56:37] <slax0r> if you're using a lot of files, which use purely jquery and pure js, then sure, you might want to distinguish them
[07:58:03] <Guest83494> 	$('#overlay').click (x) ->
[07:58:13] <Guest83494> console.log "It's been clicked like"
[07:58:49] <Guest83494> the console log occurs when the #overlay element is clicked, but also when the children of #overlay are clicked
[07:59:00] <Guest83494> how can I prevent this?
[07:59:28] <_rgn> check the target of the click event
[07:59:50] <Guest83494> _rgn: say again? ('#overlay').click (x) ->
[08:00:26] <LoneSoldier728> hey so question, what is better a form post or an ajax post? or is it a depends scenario?
[08:00:26] <LoneSoldier728> [10:57] <travisl> better is subjective
[08:00:40] <BillCriswell> Guest83494: You can do if( $(this).is('#overlay'))
[08:00:40] <LoneSoldier728> if it is a depends scenario - any pros and cons between the two... (i know one takes you to a new page)
[08:00:52] <LoneSoldier728> a user registering for an account for example
[08:01:00] <slax0r> LoneSoldier728: depends on the situation
[08:01:11] <Guest83494> BillCriswell: Right, I'll give that a go! Makes sense :)
[08:01:11] <slax0r> are you going to redirect the user afterwards to a whole new location?
[08:01:15] <slax0r> no use of doing an ajax call
[08:01:23] <slax0r> post the whole form and let the server side handle the redirect
[08:01:31] <LoneSoldier728> is it based soley on the redirect
[08:01:33] <LoneSoldier728> is that the difference
[08:01:39] <slax0r> no, not soley
[08:01:44] <slax0r> there might be other scenarios
[08:01:55] <LoneSoldier728> the benefit I see also, is that if it is ajax then they cannot resubmit a form by accident by hitting back
[08:01:56] <LoneSoldier728> ?
[08:02:12] <LoneSoldier728> thoughts on that?
[08:02:19] <slax0r> if your form submit will affect most of the page presented, also better to do a normal submit, than ajax it, and change almost 3/4 of the site with jquery
[08:02:26] <Erneston> is there a way to merge paragraphs ?
[08:02:37] <Erneston> i have 2 paragraphs, i wish to have a inbetween state
[08:02:38] <slax0r> resubmission is nowadays almost solved by browsers
[08:03:01] <BillCriswell> Guest83494: http://jsbin.com/oMOYOVa/1/edit?html,js,output should clear things up.
[08:03:09] <slax0r> Erneston: paragraph3.html(paragraph1.html() + paragraph2.html());
[08:03:13] <LoneSoldier728> ok, it makes sense. I rather do a form submit anyways, was just wondering if ajax was a possible solution. I am assuming ajax might be better for editing a profile
[08:03:24] <Erneston> that will merge then ?
[08:03:30] <Erneston> ill show you what i want
[08:04:03] <slax0r> LoneSoldier728: editing in example yes, when you only need to display that the profile has been changed, and want to leave the user on the same page
[08:04:31] <slax0r> or any other situation where you want the user to remain where he is, but want to record some data, and are not receiving back a whole bunch that you need to present on the page
[08:04:39] <LoneSoldier728> btw when you are able to just edit one field inline
[08:04:42] <slax0r> unless you can just display it somewhere
[08:04:50] <Guest83494> BillCriswell: Ah very nice, thanks
[08:04:52] <LoneSoldier728> and you have 10 felds is that 10 separate ajax calls
[08:05:02] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[08:05:03] <slax0r> well, if you want a on-the-fly edit of the profile, ajax is obviously the way to go
[08:05:12] <slax0r> you don't want to refresh the page each time a user edits an input
[08:05:46] <LoneSoldier728> right I am just saying if you want to allow for a user to edit just one field and onChange event or onfocus w.e the event is
[08:05:54] <LoneSoldier728> do you just call an ajax post then
[08:06:12] <slax0r> yeah
[08:06:23] <LoneSoldier728> or does it make more sense to not provide that because then it is a lot more server requests than necessary
[08:06:30] <LoneSoldier728> and it is better to just change it all to editable
[08:07:13] <slax0r> again depends...
[08:07:40] <LoneSoldier728> but it is multiple server requests right
[08:07:51] <Erneston> slax0r http://jsfiddle.net/Eb8Wd/
[08:08:07] <Erneston> i want to create <p> inbetween the start + end which merge characters
[08:08:28] <Erneston> so the 5 <p>'s inbetween start + end are dynamic
[08:09:22] <BillCriswell> Hm.
[08:09:23] <slax0r> LoneSoldier728: each ajax call is a server request, yes
[08:10:01] <slax0r> Erneston: not sure I understand
[08:10:20] <slax0r> do you want to concatenate the first and last paragraphs?
[08:10:33] <BillCriswell> Erneston: Do you want <p id="start">Start</p><p id="end">End</p> and then you just put 5 empty paragraphs between the two?
[08:11:10] <Erneston> let me start fresh
[08:11:18] <BillCriswell> Also, if you want that, would like to understand why.
[08:11:21] <Erneston> ideally the user inputs id="start"
[08:11:32] <BillCriswell> Haha, relying on the user.
[08:11:42] <Erneston> for now
[08:11:49] <Erneston> we will use a fixed variable
[08:12:01] <Erneston> basically after line 1 is complete
[08:12:17] <BillCriswell> "complete"?
[08:12:19] <Erneston> line 2 should be 90% line 1 and 10%  END
[08:12:31] <Erneston> am animating this
[08:12:45] <Tingle> another small question about file naming convention - I have this jquery lib called jquery.selectric.js - it comes with a css file, should I call that css file jquery.selectric.css as well? so I know it goes along with the js file?
[08:12:51] <Erneston> best to ignore animnation for now
[08:13:08] <Tingle> or remove the prefix
[08:13:13] <BillCriswell> Tingle: Ideally.
[08:13:16] <Erneston> i want to duplicate 'start' line
[08:13:23] <Tingle> ideally what
[08:13:27] <Erneston> but then change a few characters
[08:13:27] <BillCriswell> I would not remove the prefix.
[08:13:35] <Tingle> ok
[08:13:36] <Erneston> then repeat until the text is the END
[08:13:39] <BillCriswell> You know that CSS file belongs to the selectric plugin.
[08:13:42] <Erneston> does that make sense?
[08:13:48] <BillCriswell> to the jquery selectric plugin*
[08:15:04] <Erneston> so first of all how can i duplicate an element ?
[08:15:20] <BillCriswell> Erneston: .clone()
[08:15:23] <Erneston> thanx
[08:15:26] <Erneston> let me try this
[08:18:04] <bberry> how do selectors work for selecting everything.  Like i want to do $("#myDiv").removeClass("*");
[08:18:52] <BillCriswell> bberry: You can do .attr('class', '');
[08:19:19] <bberry> ah okay, that works too
[08:19:48] <bberry> i like that more actually bc the attr is more general
[08:20:03] <bberry> always forget about that >.<
[08:20:08] <Erneston> cloning working :)
[08:20:46] <Erneston> shit
[08:20:54] <Erneston> once you clone it it now has the same class/id
[08:21:16] <bberry> BillCriswell: so really what i was going to do before was $("$myDiv").removeClass("*").addClass("myClass");  Can instead i just do .attr('class',"myClass"); and that will replace all the other classes w/ myClass?
[08:21:37] <BillCriswell> bberry: Yes.
[08:21:44] <bberry> BillCriswell: Thanks :D
[08:22:06] <BillCriswell> Erneston: I'd try to avoid using id attributes in that case. Duplicate classes are fine.
[08:22:11] <BillCriswell> bberry: No problem at all.
[08:22:26] <Erneston> ill show you what i have
[08:26:08] <Erneston> http://jsfiddle.net/yjxpx/
[08:26:26] <Erneston> did clone ok, but now cant replace portion of second <p>
[08:26:49] <Bernardao> $(".js-show_message").on('click', function(){
[08:27:10] <Bernardao> $.get(url, function(data) {
[08:27:17] <Bernardao> $(this).removeClass('pending');
[08:27:46] <Bernardao> Anyone can help me why  "$(this) isn't refering to the element I'm clicking?
[08:28:05] <Erneston> this refers to the parent
[08:28:15] <Erneston> ?
[08:28:31] <Erneston> try the #id instead
[08:28:44] <Erneston> BillCriswell what am i doing wrong?
[08:29:07] <Bernardao> ok, thanks Erneston. I'll try it
[08:29:27] <BillCriswell> Bernardao: You would need to do something like var $this = $(this); outside the ajax call then you can use $this in the ajax call.
[08:29:35] <BillCriswell> this in the ajax call is not the element you clicked.
[08:30:52] <Bernardao> Thank you very much BillCriswell, it worked
[08:31:16] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[08:31:19] <Bernardao> yes, I was inside the ajax call, didn't noticed   :-)
[08:31:47] <BillCriswell> Bernardao: Yeah, a new set of eyes usually pick up on that stuff right away.
[08:31:59] <Bernardao> True!!
[08:32:46] <BillCriswell> Erneston: I'm not sure I'm following what you're trying to do. What's your desired input and output?
[08:33:59] <Erneston> input :This is where the user input entered message goes.
[08:34:12] <Erneston> output: All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
[08:34:16] <Erneston> i have cloned line 1
[08:34:33] <Erneston> in the jsfiddle you can see am trying to change the first character
[08:34:45] <Erneston> i am unable to change the cloned element
[08:34:58] <Erneston> then i will repeat this process until i reach the end text
[08:35:17] <Erneston> i need help changing the text of the cloned element please
[08:36:58] <Tingle> does $(document) and $(window) get a cached object or is that a selector and I should use var $document = $(document); ?
[08:37:28] <Erneston> i am trying to replace a character in the cloned string
[08:37:39] <joro> got a fiddle?
[08:39:18] <krambiorix> hi, can someone help me? http://pastebin.com/79HQgQbx
[08:39:40] <joro> with?
[08:39:49] <BillCriswell> Erneston: http://jsbin.com/AvEbaxI/2/edit?html,js,output might help a bit?
[08:40:30] <BillCriswell> Erneston: You can replace the anonmyous function inside .text() with your own function to do what you want.
[08:40:33] <Erneston> thx
[08:40:33] <krambiorix> joro i pasted the code in the pastebin
[08:40:43] <joro> yea
[08:40:47] <joro> but you didn't say the problem
[08:41:28] <krambiorix> joro, in the pastebin :D
[08:41:34] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: .data needs to be an object.
[08:42:37] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: There's no associative arrays in JS, only objects.
[08:43:04] <Erneston> BillCriswell are you a fan of the shining?
[08:43:13] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, but object properties can't start with a number ...
[08:43:44] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: They'd have to a string then.
[08:43:54] <BillCriswell> Erneston: Been a while since I seen it. =/
[08:44:32] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: http://jsbin.com/aWAWaDE/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:44:37] <Erneston> thats what my idea is based on
[08:44:51] <Erneston> this example is good however i can not duplicate more lines :s
[08:44:52] <Erneston> http://jsbin.com/AvEbaxI/3/edit
[08:45:14] <Erneston> i wish for 6 lines
[08:45:34] <BillCriswell> How are these 6 lines different?
[08:45:54] <Erneston> each text data is slightly different
[08:46:05] <krambiorix> BillCriswell,  that's great, thanks!!!
[08:46:33] <Erneston> input message, changes gradually line by line
[08:46:37] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[08:48:37] <PSR-Z3R0> just a simple question... I have a dropdown that when changed will either show a set of textboxes or another dropdown... I don't want to simply hide the elements because I want to serialize() the array what is the best option to "swap" the those items based on the selection ?
[08:48:49] <BillCriswell> Erneston: So you want like... "XXXXXXX" to become "YYYYYYY" with the first step being YXXXXXX and second being YYXXXXXX and so on?
[08:49:28] <PSR-Z3R0> BillCriswell sounds like a character swap to me lol
[08:49:34] <Erneston> yyeah :D
[08:49:47] <BillCriswell> Hiding an element wouldn't affect the serialization, are you saying you actually want it to?
[08:49:49] <Erneston> not in a linear order but yes
[08:50:01] <PSR-Z3R0> yes
[08:50:03] <Erneston> thats the concept :D
[08:50:06] <PSR-Z3R0> I do not want it to be serialized
[08:50:17] <BillCriswell> PSR-Z3R0: You can use the disabled attribute.
[08:50:23] <PSR-Z3R0> O.o
[08:50:29] <PSR-Z3R0> so if I disable and then hide?
[08:51:02] <BillCriswell> PSR-Z3R0: If you disable and hide it's like it doesn't even exist.
[08:51:09] <PSR-Z3R0> hmmmm interesting
[08:59:35] <BillCriswell> Erneston: http://jsbin.com/AvEbaxI/6/edit?html,js,output this is the approach i was thinking for you.
[09:01:29] <PSR-Z3R0> BillCriswell you there? http://paste.laravel.com/14PG // seems a little much for something basic no ?
[09:02:14] <PSR-Z3R0> it works though lmao
[09:03:57] <BillCriswell> PSR-Z3R0: Should be using .prop('disabled', true | false ) but it doesn't seem like too much to me.
[09:03:59] <Erneston> BillCriswell how does this look: http://jsbin.com/AvEbaxI/8/edit
[09:04:39] <Erneston> it works but the code looks bad
[09:04:51] <BillCriswell> Erneston: When you have variables with numbers at the end of the name you're probably not doing it well.
[09:06:27] <Erneston> can you help me tidy this up?
[09:06:37] <Erneston> i didnt know how to achieve this without repeating
[09:08:25] <BillCriswell> Erneston: Just repeat in a loop with a counter.
[09:08:49] <Erneston> oh god
[09:09:42] <Erneston> i am goingto have to come back to that
[09:09:52] <grafi> oô
[09:09:57] <grafi> you called for me?
[09:10:07] <Erneston> i orginally wanted user input, but its not recommended right?
[09:10:11] <grafi> hi BillCriswell how's it goin'
[09:11:01] <BillCriswell> Gooooood, you
[09:11:26] <BillCriswell> Erneston: user input is fine, just don't run it on your server before cleaning it.
[09:11:27] <grafi> dito
[09:20:25] <shwaiil> Hi
[09:21:40] <shwaiil> Q: It's possible to assign or bind a instance of an object to a data-attribute, is this correct ? Example, $('foo').data('myFoo', myObjectInstance) ? Thanks for looking!
[09:22:52] <Clex> shwaiil: it's correct.
[09:23:01] <shwaiil> Clex: thanks for looking!
[09:23:14] <Guest83494> how can I specify a hierachy (if that's how you spell it) with a selector?
[09:23:15] <shwaiil> Clex: is this a bad practice ? I don't know much about doing that
[09:23:30] <Guest83494> $(".foo" > ".bar")
[09:23:31] <Clex> shwaiil: no it's pretty cool.
[09:24:08] <Clex> Depends of your general design of course, but this specific thing is totally ok.
[09:24:32] <Clex> Guest83494: $('.foo .bar') for direct children<
[09:24:32] <Guest83494> I want to target the bar div inside foo
[09:24:42] <Guest83494> cool!
[09:24:46] <Clex> You can also do $('.foo').find('.bar') for deeper children.
[09:26:27] <Guest83494> Clex: How would the first example work with the 'this' keyword?
[09:26:43] <Clex> Guest83494: whre does this "this" come from?
[09:26:52] <Guest83494> eg. $( this '.bar')
[09:26:57] <Erneston> back again:
[09:27:02] <Clex> $(this).find('.bar')
[09:27:07] <Guest83494> ah okay
[09:27:10] <Erneston> click window and type, the hit enter and type some more : http://jsfiddle.net/SDqPq/10/
[09:27:12] <Guest83494> thanks v much
[09:27:19] <Clex> You're welcome.
[09:27:30] <Erneston> i only want it possible to be able to type one line, hit return once and user input is disabled
[09:30:31] <bekabug> what's the easiest way to get a function to scroll the page to an anchor?
[09:31:30] <bekabug> function scrollTo(hash) { location.hash = "#" + result; } isn't working
[09:34:40] <Erneston> anyone? i am trying to disable user input after the enter key is pressed
[09:36:23] <Guest83494> Clex: How can I chain these methods together to alter multiple html elements at the same time?
[09:36:58] <Guest83494> eg $(this).find('p').css("opacity" : 0)
[09:37:11] <Guest83494> say if I wanted 'this' to have its opacity changed to 0 as well
[09:41:19] <BillCriswell> Guest83494: $(this).add('p').css('opacity', 0); I think.
[09:42:11] <BillCriswell> Guest83494: Shouldn't setting it on just the parent be enough though?
[09:42:36] <BillCriswell> If you're doing $(this).css('opacity', 0) all its children are already hidden.
[09:43:27] <BillCriswell> bekabug: Do you just want it to jump to that id or do you want a slow scroll?
[09:44:07] <bekabug> i'd like it to scroll
[09:44:16] <bekabug> snappy scroll
[09:44:26] <bekabug> fast
[09:44:32] <bekabug> sorry too much coffee
[09:44:59] <BillCriswell> bekabug: Immediate or just fast?
[09:45:43] <Guest83494> BillCriswell: Okay, thanks...you're right that the children should be hidden as well. Maybe my code is a bit buggy
[09:46:55] <BillCriswell> bekabug: http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/ may be what you're looking for?
[09:47:01] <bekabug> just fast. it does need to scroll not just jump to the section
[09:47:37] <BillCriswell> Ok, then that link should definitely be what you need.
[09:49:59] <bekabug> thank you BillCriswell
[09:51:05] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/bQR4d/15/ <-- How can i get the rows in the example box to get equal width?`

[10:37:22] <Whiskey> yeh before i but i got it again :)
[10:38:45] <PSR-Z3R0> O.o
[10:38:52] <PSR-Z3R0> does javascript not accept 'string' keys for arrays?
[10:39:46] <sacho> PSR-Z3R0, what makes you think it doesn't?
[10:40:16] <PSR-Z3R0> either my syntax is wrong, or it just doesn't like me
[10:40:31] <PSR-Z3R0> and everywhere I have looked only shows integer keys
[10:40:38] <PSR-Z3R0> unless it's an object and not an array
[10:40:41] <sacho> Why don't you show your code, then?
[10:40:45] <sacho> arrays are objects.
[10:41:26] <PSR-Z3R0> well... I know I can do myArray['key'] = 'x';
[10:41:34] <PSR-Z3R0> but how can I define a full populated new Array
[10:41:42] <PSR-Z3R0> var x = new Array('key'=>'value')
[10:42:00] <PSR-Z3R0> ah
[10:42:03] <PSR-Z3R0> think I finally found it
[10:42:13] <PSR-Z3R0> var myArray = { 'key':value }
[10:42:17] <sacho> That's not an array.
[10:42:28] <PSR-Z3R0> seems to work as one
[10:42:28] <PSR-Z3R0> var myArray = { "abc":200, "xyz": 300}; alert(myArray["abc"]); // output: 200 - See more at: http://blog.xkoder.com/2008/07/10/javascript-associative-arrays-demystified/#sthash.6hYJTy5z.dpuf
[10:42:53] <sacho> Only if you use a definition of "array" that doesn't come from javascript.
[10:43:39] <sacho> { 'key': value} is an object literal
[10:43:45] <Whiskey> grafi: you still here
[10:43:49] <PSR-Z3R0> well how do you go about using Array() and creating key value pairs?
[10:43:56] <sacho> Why do you want to use an array?
[10:43:59] <sacho> Just use a plain object.
[10:44:07] <PSR-Z3R0> I don't have to was just curious
[10:44:12] <PSR-Z3R0> now that I found that other method it will work
[10:48:09] <PSR-Z3R0> o.o maybe I am missing something there...

[10:51:51] <gvdm> hello all, I'm using the simplemodal jquery plugin of ericmmartin.com (looks good eric) and I'm running into an issue, I point the plugin at a div and do .modal() but the created simplemodal-container does not contain that div but gets appended to the end of the page
[10:51:55] <gvdm> any ideas?
[10:52:14] <Whiskey> grafi: this is how it also worked
[10:52:15] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/bQR4d/16/
[10:52:46] <grafi> Whiskey isnt that what you started with?
[10:52:48] <grafi> ...
[10:53:47] <tubiz> am removing a class from an anchor tag and adding a new class to it. How can I target this new class onclick
[10:53:51] <Guest83494> hmm
[10:54:54] <BillCriswell> tubiz: $('.newclass').on('click', doSomething);
[10:55:57] <boink__> hi, I wonder if anyone can help me find the right selector / the bug in my code?
[10:55:58] <boink__> http://pastebin.sekati.com/?id=jqueryselectorproblem@926d0-524adf-t
[10:56:21] <Whiskey> hehe not really :)
[10:56:26] <tubiz> BillCriswell the new class is added dynamically
[10:57:08] <Whiskey> hoever it works but the result i get is wrong
[10:57:10] <Whiskey> i don´t get it
[10:57:49] <tubiz> BillCriswell it doesnt work
[10:58:12] <BillCriswell> tubiz: You confused me.
[10:58:50] <BillCriswell> I think you want $(document).on('click', '.newclass', doSomething);. I assumed by what you said first you would be adding the onclick event after the class was changed.
[10:59:20] <tubiz> yes
[11:00:08] <Whiskey> grafi: the width it set in both that one you provid and my is wrong
[11:00:51] <tubiz> BillCriswell so how will I do it
[11:01:36] <BillCriswell> tubiz: $(document).on('click', '.newclass', function(){ /* Do something */ });
[11:02:30] <Whiskey> its100px to mutch
[11:02:43] <grafi> Whiskey would you decide already if its working of not working ... seems like everytime you speak it one or the other oô
[11:04:01] <Whiskey> well i try to find the problem then i tthink i got it, but i think i finally got whats wrong
[11:04:08] <Whiskey> not why its got bigger but its equall
[11:06:11] <Whiskey> actully think i sloved it by change "var children=$("table").eq(1).find("td");" and "$('table').eq(1).find('td').css('width', maxWidth)" to table:visible
[11:06:53] <grafi> that looks like a very case specific solution though
[11:07:08] <grafi> change the order of your tables around and it will probably not work anymore
[11:07:15] <Whiskey> nope it wasen´t that not even if i remove code above it does it
[11:07:42] <Whiskey> so something give it wrong size
[11:08:27] <tubiz> BillCriswell I have an issue, the new class is added once a button is clicked, the action is being triggered once the namechangesis effected
[11:10:02] <BillCriswell> tubiz: http://jsbin.com/UvAdaHu/1/edit?html,js,output this help?
[11:10:36] <Whiskey> this really do my head
[11:12:11] <Whiskey> grafi let me show you the full example :D
[11:14:43] <Whiskey> grafi, http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/sCq78/ expand it and see what happens
[11:15:52] <BillCriswell> 12 Angry Men is such a classic.
[11:16:26] <jedimind> sure is
[11:17:04] <BillCriswell> 12 Angry Men and Seven are two movies I wish I could watch for the first time everytime.
[11:17:53] <BillCriswell> Would seriously get parts of my memory removed if it was possible haha.
[11:18:05] <jedimind> dont forget the usual suspects
[11:18:15] <Whiskey> expand the stupid fileinfo
[11:18:19] <BillCriswell> Absolutely.
[11:18:20] <Whiskey> and see how width it get :D
[11:18:43] <jedimind> Whiskey no shit?
[11:18:46] <BillCriswell> Memento would be another one if I was smart enough to understand it on my first viewing.
[11:18:47] <jedimind> thats what a table does
[11:19:10] <Whiskey> jedimind, its omre then widthest column in that table
[11:19:11] <Whiskey> and i don´t get why
[11:19:21] <jedimind> use your inspector and figure it out
[11:19:25] <jedimind> it has nothing ot do with jquery
[11:19:31] <jedimind> you're turning into a bit of a support vampire dude
[11:19:44] <Whiskey> well noithing in my CSS set it
[11:19:57] <jedimind> jquery is definitely not adding any widths to it
[11:20:53] <Whiskey> it does its in the jQuery
[11:20:57] <Whiskey> JavaScript ReSize <---
[11:21:08] <Whiskey> whitout that code it doesn´t happen
[11:21:55] <Whiskey> its allredy big hmmm thx for the noice wtf
[11:27:19] <googleyes> Hey Im using ajax() for a simple mailer script
[11:27:41] <googleyes> my trouble is, is that my ajax request is being handled by a different file than the one specified in my url parameter
[11:27:50] <googleyes> has anyone ever run into something like this?
[11:29:38] <googleyes> http://pastebin.com/NHpp47Lw
[11:30:25] <BillCriswell> Holy Email Validater Batman
[11:31:41] <BillCriswell> googleyes: You can do $(this).serialize() to get dataString in a much easier way.
[11:32:36] <googleyes> Ok thanks, but do you have any suggestions as to why it's firing the wrong php script?
[11:34:27] <googleyes> It's firing the contact page on my main directory, whereas I want it firing the script that is in the same directory as my js
[11:35:34] <BillCriswell> googleyes: Where does your js live?
[11:36:27] <Whiskey> Can´t find the problem :/
[11:36:30] <googleyes> well im using html5 boilerplate so its same directory just  /clinical/js
[11:36:51] <googleyes> Im thinking it could potentially be a php issue
[11:37:15] <googleyes> But I just started playing with ajax() so I figured i'd ask
[11:37:31] <BillCriswell> googleyes: "/clinical/mailer_script.php" would be from webroot.
[11:38:16] <googleyes> Yeah but its firing contact/index.php
[11:38:34] <googleyes> This makes no sense
[11:39:08] <BillCriswell> PHP is probably redirecting it. What if you just go to /clinical/mailer_script.php in your address bar?
[11:41:09] <googleyes> goes to the page, I even did a var dump to test
[11:42:02] <BillCriswell> googleyes: Anything in there that checks to see if it's an ajax request and does something weird
[11:42:02] <BillCriswell> ?
[11:44:04] <jax> shouldn't this set the value of an input, even if it is disabled? <input disabled id="#eh"> $('#eh').val('blub'); ?
[11:44:13] <googleyes> http://pastebin.com/meahBZDT
[11:45:35] <googleyes> What is weird is that it uses the  "to:emailaddress" from the correct php script and then sends it with the wrong php script with the wrong subject
[11:45:55] <BillCriswell> googleyes: Do you have some 404 redirect in there? Is /contact/ anywhere in your code>
[11:46:13] <googleyes> No where, not even in the body copy
[11:46:51] <BillCriswell> googleyes: What is #contact's action attribute?
[11:48:26] <googleyes> http://pastebin.com/RU3Ux9Vz
[11:48:38] <Whiskey> its the first table that mess it up
[11:48:47] <Whiskey> not sure if it reads size from it insted from the own table it should read
[11:50:01] <jax> eh figured it out
[11:50:31] <BillCriswell> googleyes: I bet your url is /contact?
[11:50:34] <Forbidd3n> How would you remove all td except first?
[11:50:49] <Forbidd3n> I tried this - $('#rate-plans tbody td').not(':first-child').remove();
[11:50:55] <googleyes> url on what?
[11:51:00] <BillCriswell> googleyes: Ah duh.
[11:51:08] <googleyes> on my ajax
[11:51:09] <googleyes> ?
[11:51:18] <BillCriswell> You want $('#contact').submit(function(event){ event.preventDefault(); .... });
[11:51:32] <BillCriswell> didn't notice you just had event.preventDefault() on there on its own.
[11:51:41] <BillCriswell> googleyes: No, just the URL the form is at is /contact
[11:51:48] <googleyes> OH
[11:51:53] <googleyes> good eys
[11:51:56] <googleyes> good eyes*
[11:52:55] <BillCriswell> googleyes: If you don't have an action on your form it'll just go to where you are, hence the /contact/index.php
[11:53:00] <Scoding> Hello, could anyone recommend a method for enscripting my small JS code? So it can't be just read easily
[11:53:51] <googleyes> oh well Im at clinical/ that's the thing, so it's still weird.. let me make sure this works
[11:54:19] <BillCriswell> Scoding: minify it.
[11:54:38] <BillCriswell> Scoding: http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/uglifyjs
[11:54:51] <Scoding> BillCriswell still fairly easy to decode it, what about when people use some code to add eval's and regex replaces
[11:55:14] <googleyes> Hmmm weird behaviors around these parts
[11:56:17] <BillCriswell> Scoding: http://www.javascriptobfuscator.com/Default.aspx maybe?
[11:56:38] <Scoding> Ill give it a try, thank you
[11:56:43] <BillCriswell> I'm just googling. Any reason why you want to be so secretive about it?
[11:57:47] <Scoding> The reason is secret
[11:58:01] <Scoding> In this project I have to encrypt my JS as best as possible :)
[11:58:35] <BillCriswell> Okie doke.
[11:59:47] <googleyes> Ok it's coming through.
[12:00:10] <jedimind> Scoding there's no real way to totally and fully encrypt your js
[12:00:23] <jedimind> if the browser can read it to apply it to the site... then anyone else can read it too
[12:00:58] <BillCriswell> googleyes: Sweeeeeeeeeeeeeet.
[12:01:32] <Scoding> jedimind I know, but hiding it from majority of unexperienced developers, these tools will do it
[12:02:19] <BillCriswell> Wouldn't you be more worried about an experienced developer getting their hands on it though?
[12:05:24] <Scoding> No, because people that may see it will be novice most likely
[12:06:23] <NoiseEee> Scoding: then they don't know what JS is, also your questions suggest something nefarious, so good luck
[12:06:46] <Scoding> NoiseEee all for fun, not for malicious reasons
[12:07:03] <snover> uh-huh.
[12:08:05] <Erneston> BillCriswell i got it working :)
[12:08:16] <BillCriswell> Erneston: Awesome.
[12:08:34] <Erneston> going to expand on it more so
[12:08:54] <adrian_lc> hi, best way to get all the <select> and <select multiple> separately?
[12:09:42] <BillCriswell> anildigital: select[multiple] and select:not([multiple]) perhaps?
[12:10:05] <BillCriswell> Why do I always answer a question with a fucking question mark.
[12:11:41] <BillCriswell> Andrevan: You could keep them all in one like... var $selects = $('select'); then do $selects.filter('[multiple]') or $selects.not('[multiple]')?
[12:11:57] <grafi> ?
[12:11:57] <grafi> :p
[12:12:00] <googleyes> thanks bill
[12:12:18] <adrian_lc> BillCriswell, yeah but that would be too complete queries, I think that doing a $('select') and then setting the multiple ones aside would be better
[12:12:55] <adrian_lc> is there any way I can do something like $(x).find but removing the found elements from that object?
[12:14:54] <sayd> using jquery.validate, is there a way if i have an array of name fields to validate there is at least one valid one?
[12:15:46] <BillCriswell> adrian_lc: http://jsbin.com/uVurUDU/1/edit?html,js,output maybe?
[12:16:40] <BillCriswell> If you're not crazy about that gues syou could go through each select and build the object yourself.
[12:16:59] <BillCriswell> Might be putting more effort in that it's worth though.
[12:17:29] <BillCriswell> in than it's worth*
[12:19:00] <MrPunkin> Alright, I have a function bound to window resize and it works when i actually resize the window. However, if I call $(window).trigger('resize') nothing happens. Shouldn't this trigger it the same?
[12:19:30] <adrian_lc> BillCriswell, looks good enough :) , thanks
[12:19:32] <BillCriswell> MrPunkin: Yes.
[12:19:38] <BillCriswell> adrian_lc: Woooooooord.
[12:22:42] <BillCriswell> MrPunkin: Accidentally change what window is at some point?
[12:23:12] <MrPunkin> I actually have it set with $(window).on('my.plugin.resize') and yet calling $(window).trigger('resize') or $(window).trigger('my.plugin.resize') does nothing.
[12:23:19] <MrPunkin> don't think so, calling $(window) in console shows right thing
[12:25:34] <BillCriswell> MrPunkin: I hink you want resize.something
[12:25:53] <BillCriswell> Errr ignore that.
[12:27:02] <BillCriswell> Or...
[12:27:48] <MrPunkin> BillCriswell: I think you are right
[12:27:59] <BillCriswell> MrPunkin: Maybe I am.
[12:28:08] <adrian_lc> BillCriswell, just found out I can do $selects.not($multiples); it should be just a bit better
[12:28:12] <MrPunkin> and actually that's what I have it as. Just double checked
[12:28:16] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/ociXuBO/1/edit?html,js,output was my experiment.
[12:29:24] <MrPunkin> that would have been too easy for me to have just had the event namespacing wrong… ugh
[12:29:46] <BillCriswell> adrian_lc: Ah yeah I always forget you can do that.
[12:31:29] <bekabug> I think what I want to do is really simple i'm just not sure how to address it. Can provide info for staging server if anyone has a moment to take a look. When i click on a staff member photo i want it to toggle the div containing their bio. the way i have it written now when i click on the photo ALL the bio divs toggle open lol
[12:33:50] <BillCriswell> bekabug: Are their phots in a parent container like a div?
[12:33:56] <bekabug> yes
[12:34:57] <bekabug> each photo and bio are wrapped in their own div
[12:35:40] <BillCriswell> bekabug: You might be better off putting the click event on that, then you can do like... $('.member').on('click', function(){ $(this).find('.member-bio').toggle(); });
[12:36:09] <BillCriswell> $(this) would be the container and find would look for the bio only inside that container.
[12:38:51] <bekabug> oooh
[12:38:53] <bekabug> ok
[12:40:18] <bekabug> BillCriswell: when i'm doing that how do it close the previous one if there's one open?
[12:40:50] <BillCriswell> bekabug: You can do $('.member-bio').hide()
[12:41:13] <bekabug> so put that first so if one is shown, hide it...yes?
[12:41:59] <BillCriswell> Yes. $('.member-bio').hide() // Hides them all
[12:42:17] <BillCriswell> then $(this).find('.member-bio').show();
[12:43:47] <bekabug> oooooo
[12:44:15] <BillCriswell> Here's a quick demo: http://jsbin.com/EKUriJe/1/edit?css,js,output
[12:44:40] <bekabug> nice!
[12:44:42] <bekabug> it works
[12:44:45] <bekabug> thank you :D
[12:45:19] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[12:50:09] <teufelChiCoder> hi everyone
[12:50:11] <teufelChiCoder> i'm using Jasny FileUpload - is there a way to limit what files user can pick in a file browser that pops up?
[12:50:15] <ChrisAntaki> hey
[12:50:27] <ChrisAntaki> I'm not familiar with that plugin
[12:50:32] <NoiseEee> teufelChiCoder: check with their support
[12:50:36] <ChrisAntaki> if it's based on Flash, than it's technically possible
[12:52:32] <teufelChiCoder> i looked through their support, couldn't find anything
[12:53:08] <drakythe> any tips on traversing to a parent elements immediate predecessor sibling? like I have a bunch of a links inside of li's, I need to grab the a of the li _before_ the one that gets clicked
[12:53:40] <ChrisAntaki> try $el.parent().prev()
[12:53:41] <ChrisAntaki> http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[12:54:34] <drakythe> ChrisAntaki: woo! I feel silly, dunno how I missed that one... thanks
[12:54:42] <AlexanderBB10> ladiela =) <3
[12:54:53] <ChrisAntaki> drakythe, np :)
[13:06:10] <cjm_> Hi Folks, what is the correct expression to keep a <div> in view?  I've tried $('div#cover-me').???($(window).scrollTop()) where "???" was scrollTop, and that is not working.  I'm not getting any movement of the <div>, but if I put an alert in the function, I get alerts.
[13:06:44] <BillCriswell> cjm_: Fixed positioning?
[13:07:29] <cjm_> BillCriswell, Hmm..  Positining is something I fail to understand, so it is easy to believe that my mistake is there.  I am using positin:absolute.
[13:07:53] <BillCriswell> cjm_: You probably want position: fixed
[13:08:21] <cjm_> BillCriswell, Stand by...
[13:11:39] <cjm_> BillCriswell, Nailed it!  Nice job.  Give yourself a raise.
[13:12:21] <glaksmono_> anyone know how to compile zepto with additional plugin?
[13:12:43] <BillCriswell> Haha, on it.
[13:12:50] <NoiseEee> glaksmono_: great question for #jquery
[13:17:04] <jamescarr> hmmm... how can I check to see if the only children in the current node are text nodes?
[13:19:16] <BillCriswell> jamescarr: You can check the nodeType, think you want 3?
[13:20:29] <jamescarr> I think so... isn't that a constant?
[13:20:46] <bakers> I accidentally committed to the wrong branch (did not push yet). What's the best way to revert it and put it on the correct branch
[13:23:05] <wicketn01b> When making a CORS-enabled ajax call with jQuery, the OPTIONS request comes back with a 200 OK response, and the response has Origin: mydomain.com header.  However, the subsequent GET request that gets made fails with a "Origin ... is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin".  Any ideas why?
[13:24:33] <BillCriswell> jamescarr: http://jsbin.com/aQodILa/1/edit?html,js,output ?
[13:25:27] <BillCriswell> hasAllTextNodes probably a better name.
[13:26:15] <ChrisAntaki> wicketn01b, that might be browser specific... is it possible to use JSONP?
[13:28:21] <bekabug> BillCriswell: can you take a look at this? staging example works but this jsbin one doesn't (i need css help and need to show someone the markup) http://jsbin.com/EPoHiYU/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[13:28:48] <wicketn01b> ChrisAntaki: well, we are trying to build a modern REST API.  Two of the reasons we picked CORS are (1) it's easier, and (2) it supports HTTP methods other than GET.  Yes, I suppose we can favor JSONP, especially if that's the only way to have cross-browser support for our API...
[13:29:33] <ChrisAntaki> modern is good
[13:32:07] <wicketn01b> modern is good, but must we sacrifice "modernity" (i.e., a by-the-book REST API) for cross-browser JavaScript support?
[13:32:40] <BillCriswell> bekabug: You didn't have jQuery included and fadeIn('blind', 600); is throwing an error. Check out the error console and that'll help out a lot.
[13:33:18] <bekabug> duhhhhhh lol
[13:33:34] <BillCriswell> Happens!
[13:34:18] <ChrisAntaki> wicketn01b, good question. There are many times when that's the case, but I'd have to do more investigation to comment on your specific case. Good luck though. :)
[13:35:25] <sky> hi, assuming I get a response of {} to my .ajax call, how can I then do something
[13:35:40] <sky> it doesnt seem to be the deferred fail
[13:39:15] <wicketn01b> ChrisAntaki: thanks.  is there any knowledge-base or issue that makes you think it is a browser-specific issue?
[13:40:09] <sky> ah hah
[13:40:10] <wicketn01b> My request/response can be seen here: http://pastebin.com/cM95H0nE
[13:41:03] <wicketn01b> sky: in your success callback, use one of these methods (1) http://bit.ly/XfC6SY (2) http://bit.ly/15FuZS5
[13:42:22] <sky> length?
[13:43:28] <wicketn01b> {} is a JSON object, not an array.  You must either iterate through the keys (as in option 1) or you must use a new library that turns the list of keys into an array where you can length (as in option 2)
[13:44:35] <NoiseEee> wicketn01b: s/JSON//
[13:45:31] <wicketn01b> right ^
[13:45:32] <sky> yea, im learning my way around this stuff. so maybe i should be returning something other than {} :)
[13:46:06] <wicketn01b> an empty object is not a great response
[13:46:08] <teufelChiCoder> anyone familiar with jQuery validationEngine plugin - https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine ?
[13:46:48] <sky> wicketn01b: im trying to handle empty responses // no results
[13:46:49] <teufelChiCoder> im using it in my form validation to make sure that time fields are filled out - and for time it uses sliders
[13:47:10] <sky> id be happy to learn a good pattern for this :)
[13:47:28] <wicketn01b> well, if you don't care about the body of the response, why even bother handling it?
[13:47:47] <teufelChiCoder> if user slides across and picks time, validation throws an error, but if user clicks on a slider and slide jumps to the clicked time, validation passes?
[13:48:00] <wicketn01b> sky: if you know your response is empty, all you need to handle success or fail.
[13:48:00] <teufelChiCoder> any advise on how to attach that validation to a slide effect?
[13:48:02] <sky> wicketn01b: the response is either a single result, a list of results, or nothing.
[13:48:44] <wicketn01b> sky: look for something you would expect in your response
[13:48:58] <sky> this is why I picked {} originally: (from api) The JSON data is parsed in a strict manner; any malformed JSON is rejected and a parse error is thrown. As of jQuery 1.9, an empty response is also rejected; the server should return a response of null or {} instead.
[13:50:24] <sky> wicketn01b: the point is im trying to learn how to build my app best fit for jquery, so for example, if I want to return an empty result, you are saying I should not use {} but thats what the api docs seem to tell me
[13:50:32] <wicketn01b> sky: if(response.payload.length==1) singleObjectBehavior(); else if(response.payload.length > 1) listBehavior();
[13:50:47] <sky> or maybe what I want is for the empty response rejection, is that the deferred fail?
[13:51:30] <wicketn01b> I'm not saying not to do it.  I was just asking why even bother if you're not using the response data.  In this case, you are indeed using the response data.  You need to check the response data to see if it has yor expected payload.
[13:51:53] <sky> yes, of course, im not new to all development unfortunately it may seem that way :)
[13:52:12] <raj> is there a better way to do `$('#something').data('somekey')['someotherkey']`
[13:52:13] <raj> ?
[13:53:45] <daum> hey guys when i get some data back from a ajax request, i'm trying to manipulate some of the html it sends back ie: $('tr:odd',returnedHtml).hide(), then later I want to set the modified html to an existing element ie $("#container").html(modifiedData)....I can't seem to figure out the proper way to do this.
[13:54:08] <daum> doh nevermind was a simple $(data) wrapper first
[13:59:08] <BillCriswell> raj: You could assign it to a variable and use dot notation I guess?
[13:59:14] <BillCriswell> Not sure that's "better" though.
[14:00:50] <BillCriswell> raj: Don't even need to assign it to a variable, that fails when you a have a numeric key though.
[14:01:30] <wicketn01b> sky: here is one way you might do it. http://jsfiddle.net/VvK4k/
[14:01:37] <raj> thanks BillCriswell
[14:01:43] <raj> Just thought there was a .data() way to do it
[14:01:45] <raj> built in
[14:01:49] <raj> but that's okay, just checking
[14:04:42] <wicketn01b> Can anyone help me figure out why this CORS-enabled ajax requests succeeds on OPTIONS requests but fails on the subsequent GET request?  http://pastebin.com/cM95H0nE
[14:06:36] <MrPunkin> Is there any reason at all why resizing the page would trigger my resize function fine but calling $(window).resize() or $(window).trigger('resize') doesn't? Does the page size actually need to change for it to trigger?
[14:20:15] <BillCriswell> MrPunkin: Stuff no luck, eh?
[14:20:25] <MrPunkin> no, but found a workaround
[14:20:40] <MrPunkin> that manually triggers the function for all my objects rather than relying on triggering an event
[14:26:07] <BillCriswell> Got it.
[14:53:57] <PSR-Z3R0> can someone explain to me why... var today = new Date(); console.log(today.getYear()); shows '113' ?
[14:54:48] <PSR-Z3R0> ah deprecated to getFullYear
[14:55:25] <PSR-Z3R0> and my other issue seems resolved... getMonth() is zero based :)
[15:01:01] <JFranks> Hmmm trying to use jQuery vs. JS .. But don't know why it fails on the .each() ?  http://jsbin.com/eNUzUpU/1/
[15:07:59] <shoky> JFranks: you didn't split it
[15:10:42] <ech0s7> hi
[15:10:44] <ech0s7> i have a problem
[15:10:57] <ech0s7> why $('#box_news_1') return me [] ?
[15:11:12] <ech0s7> in page html i have a div with id="box_news_1"
[15:11:36] <shoky> ech0s7: and what is $('#box_news_1').length  ?
[15:11:38] <ech0s7> and i have only 1 element with this id
[15:11:39] <JFranks> shoky: ahh thanks sir!
[15:11:50] <ech0s7> shoky: 0
[15:12:11] <shoky> ech0s7: then you don't have an element with that ID in the DOM. or the DOM is not ready yet
[15:12:28] <shoky> `demo @ ech0s7
[15:12:29] <b-ot> ech0s7: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:12:38] <ech0s7> i'm running this code in chrome console
[15:12:41] <ech0s7> with page created
[15:12:48] <shoky> jsfiddle it
[15:12:52] <ech0s7> ok
[15:13:54] <shoky> ech0s7: got your code inside $(document).ready( .. ) ?
[15:14:14] <shoky> (or at the end of <body> )
[15:15:34] <ech0s7> shoky: i think that should not be a problem this
[15:15:51] <ech0s7> because i'm try this javascript code from chrome console
[15:15:55] <shoky> oK
[15:15:57] <ech0s7> after that DOM is created
[15:16:00] <shoky> gotcha
[15:16:57] <shoky> ech0s7: uhm  what about $('box_news_1')  ;]
[15:17:12] <shoky> console has a built-in $  if you maybe didnt include jquery properly
[15:18:04] <shoky> so just in case.. console.log($.fn.jquery)
[15:18:36] <ech0s7> console.log($.fn.jquery)
[15:18:36] <ech0s7> 1.6 cordova.js:5638
[15:18:36] <ech0s7> undefined
[15:18:43] <shoky> there you go
[15:18:54] <shoky> no jquery
[15:18:58] <shoky> or at least not with $
[15:19:26] <shoky> oh sorry
[15:19:33] <shoky> i missed the 1.6
[15:19:59] <shoky> what's that cordova.js..? thought you were running this from the console
[15:20:58] <ech0s7> shoky: cordova.js is a library for phonegap application
[15:21:34] <shoky> yes.. why is it written in the console log?
[15:22:12] <shoky> nevermind.. jsfiddle/demo
[15:22:36] <ech0s7> https://www.dropbox.com/s/j0p9r91dgndbcjn/Screenshot%202013-11-06%2000.22.07.png
[15:23:04] <shoky> oks
[15:23:53] <shoky> so.. i donno phonegap/cordova, but in jquery if $('...').length === 0  then the element is not in the DOM
[15:25:14] <shoky> meaning it was never there, or it has been removed
[15:26:46] <ech0s7> console.log($)
[15:26:46] <ech0s7> function ( selector, context ) {
[15:26:46] <ech0s7> 		// The jQuery object is actually just the init constructor 'enhanced'
[15:26:46] <ech0s7> 		return new jQuery.fn.init( selector, context, rootjQuery );
[15:26:46] <ech0s7> 	}
[15:27:13] <walidvb> i saw a plugin recently that would change a div's class according to what is behind it, anyone knows?
[15:27:29] <shoky> ech0s7: that doesn't help. also don't paste in the channel, use jsfiddle or a pastebin
[15:31:41] <sayd> How would I use jquery-validation to check if multiple form values were valid?
[15:31:58] <sayd> like name="foo" x 10 an i want all them to validate
[15:35:33] <ech0s7> shoky: it's a console problem
[15:35:43] <ech0s7> because if i print this value with an alert
[15:35:49] <ech0s7> it say me the right value
[15:37:49] <shoky> ech0s7: console is better than alerts, so i donno what you're doing. show screenshots of the console.log and the DOM elements tab showing that element with the right ID.
[15:38:07] <shoky> or... make a demo
[16:32:45] <NaN> does some one know any plugin to do this > http://bootstrapformhelpers.com/phone/ but with custom patterns?
[16:52:58] <NaN> is it better to use 'input[name=foo]' or to use and id or a class?
[16:53:09] <NaN> any good pattern about selectors?
[16:54:03] <shoky> NaN: using id's and classes is generally faster
[16:54:44] <shoky> $('#some_id')   $('.some_class')   those are good patterns :p
[18:12:03] <Joey__> hi all, I do a (form).submit(handler) which works if I single click an element of type input, but it fails when it's called from ondblclick or onkeydown for enter
[18:12:12] <Joey__> am I missing something?
[18:14:20] <thinkxl> Joey__ you can't do it with onkeydown because that is for input or textareas elements
[18:14:35] <thinkxl> not sure about dbclick
[18:15:20] <Joey__> I'm reading this in the docs: Forms can be submitted either by clicking an explicit <input type="submit">, <input type="image">, or <button type="submit">, or by pressing Enter when certain form elements have focus.
[18:15:32] <Joey__> does that apply when called from code as well ?
[18:15:37] <Joey__> http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[18:15:53] <Joey__> i.e. I should first set focus to one of those elements ?
[18:16:11] <Joey__> and call it's click from a ondblclick / keypress
[18:16:52] <thinkxl> yes but
[18:16:58] <thinkxl> you need to target a button or a link
[18:17:00] <thinkxl> no tthe form
[18:17:20] <thinkxl> something like $(button).on('click', function(e) { $(form).submit() });
[18:18:07] <thinkxl> button.on('keydown', fn);
[18:18:24] <thinkxl> fn can be function(e) { $('form').submit(); }
[18:18:32] <thinkxl> should be*
[18:20:10] <thinkxl> http://pastebin.com/ci0QbFQu
[18:20:29] <thinkxl> but keypress, will submit the form each time the user type something inside the input
[18:20:48] <thinkxl> and that's not good, but not really know what you want to accomplish
[18:20:50] <Joey__> I check for enter in the keypress
[18:20:59] <thinkxl> ooh, sorry
[18:21:27] <thinkxl> then I think that you should add the method to the textarea
[18:21:30] <thinkxl> and check the keyCode
[18:21:41] <Joey__> I have a menu, it has a arrow button to go next after selecting a menu item, but you can also double click an item, press enter, or use a sliding motion
[18:22:12] <Joey__> they all work with postback, but now I need a long action, so I want to do a jquery polling thing, and then do a proper postback
[18:22:26] <Joey__> I don't have a text areay
[18:22:34] <thinkxl> I was thinking about a form, sorry
[18:22:40] <thinkxl> I didn't picture it right
[18:22:41] <Joey__> this menu works with arrow up/down and enter
[18:22:52] <Joey__> yeah it is a form, but not an input form
[18:23:50] <Joey__> just when you think you are almost done stuff like this creeps in
[18:24:02] <thinkxl> lol, yeah
[18:24:10] <thinkxl> can you set an example in jsbin.net
[18:24:18] <thinkxl> because I can't figure out what you want to do
[18:24:18] <Joey__> this is why a prefer desktop apps instead of css/javascript
[18:24:49] <thinkxl> different solutions for different situations (y)
[18:27:48] <Joey__> an example wouldn't be easy, wouldn't know how to extract it from what I have
[18:27:58] <Joey__> this is a screen shot of the menu though http://oi42.tinypic.com/2pony1s.jpg
[18:28:04] <thinkxl> let me see
[18:28:10] <thinkxl> I'm interested on what you are doing
[18:28:45] <Joey__> you can navigate with the arrows, after selecting an item, or use enter, doubleclick, or slide motion
[18:29:18] <Joey__> and now I'm adding an twirling animation for the right arrow when a lengthly operation is done before actually going "next"
[18:29:51] <Joey__> which works when you click the arrow, but not with the other methods because webapplications are a pain heh :)
[18:30:28] <thinkxl> oooooh I see
[18:31:13] <thinkxl> so you select something and want tu submit the form when dbl click the arrow
[18:31:14] <thinkxl> right?
[18:32:37] <Joey__> no the arrow you single click, but you can go to the page for the user by double clicking the area that is a rounded rect in the screenshot
[18:32:54] <Joey__> the logic is that a single click selects the item, a double click goes next
[18:33:21] <Joey__> you can also delete items, so that would be a single click to select it, and then an X in a circle appears before the next arrow
[18:33:24] <thinkxl> of course, I'm a dumb ass
[18:33:33] <thinkxl> weird so
[18:33:38] <Joey__> clicking that X shows a 'are you sure'
[18:33:38] <thinkxl> that works with click and not dblclick
[18:34:03] <thinkxl> that rounded grey area, what element is ?
[18:34:23] <thinkxl> it is a input?
[18:34:27] <thinkxl> a button?
[18:34:50] <Joey__> no just a div styled
[18:35:02] <Joey__> the only real input elements are the arrows at the bottom
[18:35:25] <Joey__> oh no, those are images heh
[18:35:49] <Joey__> there is no input element in this page
[18:36:05] <thinkxl> so you are trying div.on('dblclick', function(e) { form.submit(); }
[18:36:06] <thinkxl> ?
[18:36:23] <Joey__> yeah
[18:36:28] <Joey__> I'm using jQuery.post()
[18:36:34] <Joey__> inside the submit function
[18:36:55] <Joey__> do I need submit? can't I just do jquery.post without form submitting ?
[18:37:42] <Joey__> like in doubleclick call jquery.post(url, data)
[18:38:52] <Joey__> http://www.nomorepasting.com/getpaste.php?pasteid=39664
[18:38:57] <Joey__> it has some asp.net stuff in there
[18:41:18] <thinkxl> yes you can post without submit
[18:41:26] <thinkxl> I'm trying to figure out
[18:41:36] <thinkxl> btw what are you using for the UI?
[18:42:09] <Joey__> css?
[18:42:54] <Joey__> I'm not using a library (except for a popup from jquery)
[18:43:49] <thinkxl> it looks like topcat.io
[18:46:58] <Joey__> everything looks the same heh
[18:47:02] <Joey__> it's hard to be original
[18:47:22] <thinkxl> haha yeah
[18:47:23] <thinkxl> ok
[18:47:26] <thinkxl> that is the submit
[18:47:39] <thinkxl> you can do dblclick and call the post element without the submit
[18:47:49] <thinkxl> I mean the $.post function
[18:48:10] <thinkxl> div.on 'dblclick' function $.post
[18:48:15] <thinkxl> that doesn't work?
[18:51:48] <Joey__> I removed the submit stuff and now doubleclick, slide and enter work
[18:52:12] <Joey__> clicking the arrow does a postback now, but that should be fixable
[18:53:37] <Joey__> yeah return false fixed the postback
[18:54:54] <thinkxl> (y) cool
[18:55:00] <thinkxl> nice UI btw
[18:56:38] <Joey__> thanks, and thanks for the help
[18:56:46] <frank_o> With jQuery Mobile, anybody know why Masonry won't initialize on #page2 if I go to #page1 first and then click on the link to #page2? http://fiddle.jshell.net/frank_o/UQdJ3/show/light/ (works if you resize the window afterwards though)
[18:57:07] <frank_o> When going directly to #page2, however, everything works fine: http://fiddle.jshell.net/frank_o/UQdJ3/show/light/#page2
[18:59:05] <Joey__> your things get sized before the browser/element size is known ?
[18:59:43] <frank_o> Joey__: Good point
[19:01:45] <HIo> what's up
[19:01:48] <HIo> ?
[19:34:33] <Blaster> hey if you watch your console and type text into the input here, why is it always a character behind?  http://jsfiddle.net/4qc8H/
[19:41:02] <LaMakina> @Blaster , use keyup instead
[19:41:19] <LaMakina> the input hasn't been populated by your new keypress yet
[19:41:30] <LaMakina> http://jsfiddle.net/4qc8H/1/
[19:42:56] <Blaster> Thanks finally got it
[19:46:06] <Blaster> I am sending an AJAX request upon keyup for an input area, but it's lagging huge because it's sending a ton of AJAX requests.  How can I throttle it?
[19:47:23] <Blaster> I am making an autocomplete dropdown
[19:48:04] <Guest14134> what are you sending back from the ajax request?
[19:48:07] <LaMakina> how much data can you be sending .. ?
[19:49:31] <shiftins> I'm upgrading a bit of code to 1.10.x and I see a change in how events are stored in the data object..
[19:50:31] <shiftins> jQuery.data(node, 'events') used to list events
[19:50:52] <shiftins> is the list of events still available but in a different location?
[19:51:30] <shiftins> for example, of you had $(node).on('click', fn), jQuery.data(node, 'events') would retrun an object with each of the events
[19:52:38] <shiftins> it would be {'click', [0, delegate, etc]}
[19:53:00] <shiftins> anyone know if that data is still available.. this is a 1.7.x upgrade to 1.10
[19:59:14] <shiftins> ha, this is the comment in the code..
[19:59:45] <shiftins> #Users should not attempt to inspect the internal events object using jQuery.data..
[19:59:53] <shiftins> #it is undocumented and subject to change. But does anyone listen? No.
[20:00:05] <shiftins> :D
[20:22:55] <shiftins> $._data($0, 'events')
[20:23:22] <shiftins> err.. $._data(node, 'events'); the comment from 1.7 probably still applies.. but umm.. ;)
[21:02:06] <krz> whats the best way to get the basename and extension of a file?

[21:50:35] <spygame> hey guys, i'm doing a feature which requires the user to select multiple dates and times from the calendar without having to open and close the calendar for each selection
[21:50:39] <spygame> any ideas ?
[21:51:56] <sacho> "the calendar"?
[21:55:45] <spygame> sacho, yeah the calendar
[21:59:00] <spygame> sacho, like jquery ui datepicker but with time selection as well and i want to be able to select multiple dates without having to open/close the calendar
[22:00:33] <sacho> ok. Well, I haven't used jquery's datepicker, but you can presumably preempt clicks on the dates, preventing the close.
