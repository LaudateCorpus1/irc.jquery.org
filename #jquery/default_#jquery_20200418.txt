[13:52:58] <inthl> I am loading a document and once that's done, the ready event is being triggered. fine so far. now I want to use $.ajax to load some html text which in iself containts <script>$(document).ready(function() { .. and when doing this the ready event was already triggered - the mentioned code in <script> is being exeucted immediately, which is unwanted. using jQuery.holdReady() before the getScript call did not help. is there a way to revert
[13:52:58] <inthl> the ready state and simply call it later when I want to, using e.g. jQuery.ready() ?
[13:54:28] <Uhkis> how about wrapping your stuff in a function and calling that
[13:55:10] <inthl> well my issue is that the html code is actually for another site, where I would rather not change the source since this would require lots of work
[13:57:38] <inthl> Uhkis, I mean, is `reverting` this until it is manually triggered again even possible? all the docs for holdReady() are mentioning that the function is useless, once the ready event was triggered before
[14:01:28] <Uhkis> *if* you have control over that remote code, it's not a lot of work to wrap it up
[14:03:20] <inthl> well it is, (document).ready is occuring lots of times.
[14:03:50] <inthl> however, I think I'll have to look into it as it seems. what kind of wrapper are you suggesting?
[14:07:03] <Uhkis> replace all under document.ready with "function something()" and later you can just call document.ready(something);
[14:07:54] <Uhkis> then in your ajaxing one call that function
[14:09:00] <inthl> hm, but what if I have multiple $(document).ready(function() { in one .js file or within multiple included js files? this way I'd declare that function more than once
[14:11:55] <Uhkis> you shouldnt :D
[14:15:09] <inthl> well I'm running nuts on this since hours
[14:15:55] <inthl> the solution for this seems so easy - just don't execute stuff that is within document.ready until I say so, but there seems no way to do this once the event was triggered before
[18:38:37] <Guddu> I am using DataTables plugin. On each row of the table I have a button that makes an ajax call. This works fine on the first page of the table but when i go to second page and attempt the same click from there on nothing happens at all. No click events are registered as confirmed by an alert that i put on the click function. What could be wrong?
[18:53:22] <aquamen> If I have a .slideUp() that runs against a class that belongs to multiple elements, how do I run code after the *last* element has completed its slideup effect? It seems like using the built in complete callback runs the callback after every individual element completes its slideup instead of doing it once when theyre all complete
[18:59:10] <teamcoltra> Hey everyone, I am really bad with javascript / jquery but this demo is almost identical to what I need to do https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/ the problem is that php's json_encode wraps the object in an array like this [{"username":"teamcoltra"}] I was hoping to not mess with that side of things and figure out what I would need to do with
[18:59:10] <teamcoltra> the demo shown to have it deal with this?
[19:00:33] <teamcoltra> I feel like I must be exceptionally dumb here because googling "Jquery .getJSON php encode_json" and similar searches get me nothing related to this problem
[22:18:37] <dopie> exit
