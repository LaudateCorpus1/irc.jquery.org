[10:42:56] <whoozits> Could anyone point in the right direction as to why this isnt working: https://jsfiddle.net/9Lvohz26/
[10:46:23] <amikrop> How can I select all "p" elements, next in place of "this" (current "p" element)? Not that they are not necessarily siblings to each other (this gave me the hard time)
[10:46:43] <c_bluntish> hey, what does this mean?
[10:46:51] <c_bluntish> document.getElementsByClassName("close")[0];
[10:46:55] <c_bluntish> the [0] bit?
[10:47:09] <amikrop> c_bluntish: the first one of those selected
[10:47:20] <MassDebates> [0
[10:47:24] <MassDebates> [0] = first of an array
[10:47:24] <c_bluntish> ahh :)
[10:47:28] <c_bluntish> thank you
[10:47:42] <MassDebates> since the returned elements come in an array, a listing of the qualifying elements
[10:48:05] <MassDebates> amikrop, are you looking for 'nilla js or jquery way of selecting all p elements
[10:48:18] <MassDebates> and what do you mean by "next in place of 'this' (current 'p' element)?"
[10:48:25] <amikrop> MassDebates: jquery
[10:48:36] <MassDebates> maybe make a codepen with a series of p elements in the way that you're describing?
[10:48:46] <amikrop> MassDebates: i want to select all <p>s that are after the current one (they will not be siblings though)
[10:48:51] <MassDebates> okay.
[10:48:52] <MassDebates> ~
[10:49:26] <amikrop> we have the current one at $(this)
[10:49:54] <amikrop> nextAll() etc refer to siblings as far as I understood, that didnt help me
[10:50:16] <MassDebates> are tehre p tags before $(this) that exist but cannot be selected?
[10:50:26] <amikrop> that i dont want to select yes
[10:51:13] <laceupyrboots> hey, how would i express the state of an element i've applied .show() to? i'm trying to write a conditional essentially saying "if <div> is shown/.show() is applied on it, perform the following function"
[10:51:27] <MassDebates> amikrop, is the structure/layout of the p tags predicatble?
[10:51:33] <amikrop> MassDebates: no
[10:52:30] <MassDebates> Then you'll need a more complicated script that doesn't use a simple function of jquery
[10:52:30] <amikrop> $('p').filter(function (index) { index > $(this).index() } );  // this didn't work
[10:52:36] <MassDebates> some sort of loop that filters and selects throguh
[10:52:40] <amikrop> really is that so hard?
[10:52:52] <MassDebates> amikrop, those are weird circumstances that I've never had to fulfill.
[10:53:00] <MassDebates> amikrop, sorry bud.
[10:53:11] <amikrop> "all next <p>s" are weird circumstances? :P
[10:53:20] <MassDebates> That's not the entire circumstance.
[10:53:36] <amikrop> what part complicates it then? :)
[10:53:39] <MassDebates> "all next ps in an unpredictable layout/structure of code that aren't siblings of $(this)
[10:53:57] <amikrop> MassDebates: that are not *necessarily* siblings of this
[10:54:05] <amikrop> if they are we don't mind
[10:54:17] <MassDebates> I would traverse into some sort of container
[10:54:24] <amikrop> ok thanks
[10:54:25] <MassDebates> but I don't know what container it would be because the code is unpredictable.
[10:54:34] <MassDebates> You would need to provide an example
[10:54:43] <MassDebates> but there's no stock function in jquery that can do this. you will need a combination of a few.
[10:54:52] <MassDebates> nextall() doesn't do what you want, like you've said.
[10:54:57] <MassDebates> amikrop, I would need a codepen
[10:55:12] <amikrop> really, "all next <p>s that can be found anywhere in the document, structure is irrelevant"
[10:55:26] <amikrop> in case you didn't understand
[10:55:36] <MassDebates> Yeah, I don't know how to do that.
[10:55:42] <amikrop> ok thanks anyway :)
[10:55:55] <MassDebates> your best chance is making a codepen that I can lok
[10:56:01] <MassDebates> and incorporating your attempts and maybe I can repair
[10:56:05] <MassDebates> otherwise, stick around and wait
[10:56:18] <amikrop> I can't make a codepen cause the structure isn't known beforehand
[10:56:25] <pavonia> amikrop: May I ask what the use case for this is?
[10:56:27] <amikrop> I ll try to make a manual solution then
[10:56:40] <amikrop> pavonia: long story :)
[10:56:56] <MassDebates> lol
[10:57:04] <amikrop> anyway a manual solution won't be so hard to implement
[10:57:08] <amikrop> thanks again
[10:58:31] <MassDebates> amikrop, you could give $(this) a classname or arbitrary identifier
[10:58:35] <MassDebates> then find all p elements
[10:58:48] <MassDebates> then loop through the entire array, assigning classes to all of them before $(this)
[10:58:58] <MassDebates> and assigning different classes to all of them after $(this)
[10:59:12] <MassDebates> Then select that class.
[10:59:20] <MassDebates> (or just select from that selector query0
[11:00:09] <amikrop> thanks
[11:20:56] <c_bluntish> if I add css using .css({'color': 'black', 'font-weight':'bold'}) etc it seems to remove all of the other :hovor css I have in a file?
[11:22:24] <Woet> c_bluntish: .css doesn't affect CSS files, it just adds inline css.
[11:22:38] <c_bluntish> ah
[11:23:22] <Woet> well, not really in-line. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[11:24:47] <c_bluntish> ah, I think it was over writing my file css, I just set important! n it  worked :)
[12:53:36] <c_bluntish> hrm, why would an ajax response all of a sudden stop updating?
[12:53:44] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[12:53:45] <c_bluntish> no errors on console
[12:53:54] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you hit the url directly?
[12:54:06] <c_bluntish> the ajax url?
[12:54:15] <robertmaxrees> yes.  the url you're using to get data.
[12:54:22] <robertmaxrees> or is it a post?
[12:54:45] <c_bluntish> its a post
[12:54:56] <c_bluntish> and it does what it is meant to, redirects me to login
[12:55:10] <c_bluntish> the response txt is correct
[12:55:14] <robertmaxrees> so then what do you mean "stop updating"?
[12:55:23] <c_bluntish> response text is like this
[12:56:44] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:56:54] <c_bluntish> $('#man_user_id').val('13324'); $('#man_usr_fn').val('Some Name'); $('#man_usr_un').val('someuser'); $('#man_usr_pw').val('somepw'); $('#man_usr_dr').val('80'); $('#man_usr_mn').val('07777555555'); $('#man_usr_em').val('somememail@hushmail.com'); $('#man_usr_co').val('IT Manager'); $('#man_usr_ic').prop('checked', true);
[12:57:01] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[12:57:05] <c_bluntish> thats my response txt and it works
[12:57:11] <c_bluntish> did
[12:57:11] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:57:20] <c_bluntish> just decided to stop working
[12:57:23] <robertmaxrees> so you're sending back JS?
[12:57:33] <c_bluntish> yep :)
[12:57:44] <robertmaxrees> good luck heh.
[12:57:46] <c_bluntish> that wrong?
[12:57:51] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[12:57:55] <c_bluntish> why
[12:57:56] <robertmaxrees> you should send back just data.
[12:58:39] <c_bluntish> is there a reason?
[12:58:46] <c_bluntish> more secure I guess?
[12:59:20] <c_bluntish> ?
[12:59:57] <robertmaxrees> sorry - at work./
[13:00:07] <robertmaxrees> you want to separate logic from code.
[13:00:15] <c_bluntish> yes good point
[13:00:16] <robertmaxrees> you're sending over code - ajax should really just send data.
[13:00:24] <robertmaxrees> err, *logic from data hahaha
[13:00:29] <c_bluntish> I will rewrite it, but for now, why wont what I am doing work?
[13:00:36] <devi8> does .filter() return undefined or empty set if none of the elements match the filter params?
[13:00:38] <robertmaxrees> how are you running that code?
[13:01:05] <robertmaxrees> devi8 empty.
[13:01:23] <c_bluntish> I just eval(response)
[13:01:35] <c_bluntish> its only code to populate input boxes
[13:01:43] <robertmaxrees> oh yikes
[13:01:54] <c_bluntish> hehe security hole?!
[13:02:01] <robertmaxrees> performance and security hole.
[13:02:22] <c_bluntish> for whatever reason, its now not working, probably for the best
[13:02:40] <c_bluntish> the universe gave me a bug that made me think about what I was doing
[13:02:41] <c_bluntish> lol
[13:03:16] <robertmaxrees> brb
[13:03:32] <c_bluntish> np
[13:17:42] <AliG1000> This works fine: $("li.list[data-id='99']");  How do I correctly write it so that 99 is a variable. Double quotes, single quotes?
[13:17:48] <robertmaxrees> back.
[13:17:57] <robertmaxrees> AliG1000 well, back up :)
[13:18:31] <robertmaxrees> c_bluntish so yeah, youw anna send back JSON w/e .  don't make your server "render" javascript.
[13:18:37] <robertmaxrees> generating code like that is weird.
[13:19:02] <robertmaxrees> AliG1000 you can either use template strings or just string concatenation.
[13:19:16] <robertmaxrees> though I'm argue you want neither in this case since data attributes are sketch to select on.
[13:19:33] <AliG1000> thanks - I'll try them
[13:19:44] <robertmaxrees> use a .filter() instead.
[13:20:17] <robertmaxrees> $('.list').filter(function() { return $(this).data('id') === whateverIdYouWant });
[13:22:29] <MassDebates> robertmaxrees, there was a guy hat was asking a question
[13:22:32] <MassDebates> and I want to know how to do it
[13:22:36] <MassDebates> I was unable to answer his question
[13:22:36] <robertmaxrees> MassDebates?
[13:22:49] <MassDebates> Guy's name was amikrop
[13:22:50] <MassDebates> hold on
[13:22:53] <MassDebates> here's his query:
[13:23:04] <MassDebates> "How can I select all "p" elements, next in place of "this" (current "p" element)? Not that they are not necessarily siblings to each other (this gave me the hard time)"
[13:23:11] <MassDebates> what do
[13:23:12] <c_bluntish> robertmaxrees, I know what you mean, my approach is wrong, but server isnt really rendering js, its just sending b ack js and the browser is rendering it? I post process it before the browswer renders it?
[13:23:29] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating ideas
[13:23:46] <robertmaxrees> by "render" i mean "the server is generating code"
[13:23:52] <c_bluntish> ah ok
[13:24:00] <c_bluntish> render normaly applies to the display of items
[13:24:01] <robertmaxrees> data is fine, but avoid logic.
[13:24:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:24:08] <c_bluntish> will do
[13:24:09] <robertmaxrees> it's contextual ;)
[13:24:12] <c_bluntish> indeed
[13:24:27] <c_bluntish> I round my problem, had 2 inputs with the same id by mistake
[13:24:29] <robertmaxrees> MassDebates i'd need to see some markup to understand what they mean.
[13:24:40] <robertmaxrees> c_bluntish that'd do it.
[13:24:44] <c_bluntish> I am going to re-write it now to only return data
[13:24:45] <robertmaxrees> easy enough fix for cases liek that.
[13:24:50] <c_bluntish> indeed
[13:24:58] <robertmaxrees> and super easy to test.
[13:25:08] <c_bluntish> console and network in ff where 100% ok, i knew it was something silly
[13:25:12] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:25:20] <robertmaxrees> $('[id=whateverIdHere]').length
[13:25:31] <robertmaxrees> ^ if this returns anything other than 1, you'll have headaches.
[13:25:39] <c_bluntish> ah nice!
[13:26:07] <c_bluntish> is it possible to say foreach $('[id=*]').length
[13:26:09] <robertmaxrees> you can't use the regular id selector syntax since rthat always returns 1.
[13:26:13] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:26:16] <robertmaxrees> why would you?
[13:26:28] <c_bluntish> than I could show all id's and see if I have any dupes
[13:26:42] <robertmaxrees> easier way.
[13:26:49] <c_bluntish> go through the entire dom object and show id's that have length > 1
[13:26:59] <c_bluntish> ooooh an easier way
[13:27:05] <robertmaxrees> well, back up lol
[13:27:08] <robertmaxrees> your question is changing.
[13:27:15] <robertmaxrees> i'd start with something like:
[13:27:36] <robertmaxrees> var allIds = $('[id=*]').map(function() { return $(this).prop('id') }).get();
[13:27:44] <robertmaxrees> ^ this will get you an array of all IDs.
[13:27:54] <c_bluntish> awsome
[13:27:59] <robertmaxrees> then you can do w/e against that array.
[13:28:02] <c_bluntish> why did you use call .get
[13:28:25] <c_bluntish> calls the function?
[13:28:28] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:28:33] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/map/ -> "As the return value is a jQuery object, which contains an array, it's very common to call .get() on the result to work with a basic array."
[13:28:47] <c_bluntish> ah
[13:29:45] <c_bluntish> whats the diff between jquery.map and .map?
[13:30:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:30:09] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[13:30:28] <c_bluntish> I was reading your link and it said "If you wish to process a plain array or object, use the jQuery.map() instead. "
[13:30:37] <robertmaxrees> the docs explain.
[13:30:41] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:30:50] <dskull> Q: what's a good way to set a 10 second timeout on the $(element).on('load', function? (I'm using it to check if an image element I swapped in is loaded before proceeding and want to error after 10 seconds if not)
[13:30:52] <robertmaxrees> one is for plain arrays/objects, the othert is for jQuery objects.
[13:31:03] <robertmaxrees> dskull recursive function
[13:31:12] <robertmaxrees> that calls setTimeout on load.
[13:31:28] <c_bluntish> all hail robertmaxrees here to help out us noobs
[13:31:37] <c_bluntish> robertmaxrees++;
[13:32:11] <dskull> robertmaxrees, would that settimeout cause a 10 second delay regardless if the image loads in 1 sec?
[13:32:34] <robertmaxrees> dskull if you do it recursively, then no.
[13:32:46] <robertmaxrees> it'll be 10 seconds after the prior call finished.
[13:33:05] <robertmaxrees> there are ways to make it more consistent if you actually need every 10 seconds.
[13:35:09] <c_bluntish> hrm
[13:35:52] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:36:03] <dskull> hmm I'll play around with it, ideally it will run immideatly/on demand and if it takes longer than 10secs to load an image it'll assume there's a problem with the internet and hault the application
[13:36:41] <robertmaxrees> dskull you can do that, you'll just need to juggle timeouts.  which can be less than fun.
[14:34:38] <c_bluntish> is it possible to say in an ajax request, on the server side "if sending url does not have a given name / domain eg if sending site is not somesite.com, then ignore "
[14:34:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:34:57] <c_bluntish> hi again lol
[14:35:17] <robertmaxrees> "sending url"?
[14:36:06] <c_bluntish> when I post to a php file, can I say "if sending / posting url does not contain a given domain, then ignore" meaning I can only say process requests from a given url
[14:36:08] <c_bluntish> or domain
[14:36:13] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:36:18] <robertmaxrees> step back.
[14:36:25] <robertmaxrees> what problem are you trying to solve?
[14:36:31] <c_bluntish> so only process ajax requests sent to me from say google.com
[14:36:46] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:36:49] <c_bluntish> just trying to make it so if anyone tried to send an ajax request to a file it ignore it
[14:36:50] <robertmaxrees> or for your site, you mean?
[14:36:54] <c_bluntish> yeah
[14:36:58] <robertmaxrees> that's called CORS.
[14:37:01] <c_bluntish> only process requests from my url
[14:37:07] <c_bluntish> isnt that a beer?
[14:37:35] <robertmaxrees> so fun fact.
[14:37:44] <c_bluntish> ah thank you
[14:37:48] <c_bluntish> https://enable-cors.org/server_php.html
[14:37:50] <c_bluntish> :)
[14:37:53] <robertmaxrees> except.
[14:38:05] <robertmaxrees> that'll do the opposite of wehat you want.
[14:38:05] <c_bluntish> whn its not fun?
[14:38:19] <robertmaxrees> that'll allow any domain to access your stuff.
[14:38:22] <robertmaxrees> you want to restrict.
[14:38:32] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS
[14:38:58] <c_bluntish> ah superb!
[14:40:06] <c_bluntish> while ( robertmaxrees.chans['jquery'].chan.status.op==false){ robertmaxrees++;}
[14:45:28] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:28:38] <c_bluntish> how can I set the index of a <select> using jquery
[16:38:12] <purgedmoon> Anyone wanna take a look at this and tell me why the variable values are outputting correctly? I had it working yesterday then I borked it up somehow
[16:38:14] <purgedmoon> http://jsfiddle.net/k8zn7xrf
[17:12:56] <robertmaxrees> c_bluntish wrong approach :)
[17:13:01] <robertmaxrees> set using the valuye of the one you want.
[17:13:32] <robertmaxrees> purgedmoon can you be more specific and clarify?
[17:13:33] <c_bluntish> hi, yeah thanks for the advice, stack over flow is my friend :)
[17:14:10] <c_bluntish> one line of code :)
[17:14:20] <robertmaxrees> $('select').val('foo')
[17:14:22] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:14:27] <bravvve22> hello i have some website ,my dns provider add <iframe> to my site ,and i wan to add google adsense ,so there is many heads is it possible that i add it in the first head
[17:14:51] <purgedmoon> robertmaxress basically I made it to prevent a duplicate or a possible duplicate select value
[17:14:54] <robertmaxrees> bravvve22 maybe?  depends on a whole host of factors.
[17:15:03] <robertmaxrees> purgedmoon so how do i replicate your bug?
[17:15:12] <robertmaxrees> because i'm not clear what the problem is.
[17:15:29] <purgedmoon> ah, well lemme give you a new js fiddle sec
[17:15:39] <purgedmoon> http://jsfiddle.net/k8zn7xrf/5/
[17:15:51] <purgedmoon> So if you try to change select values youll notice some are disabled and some are not
[17:15:59] <purgedmoon> basically if you're able to create a duplicate its a bug
[17:16:19] <purgedmoon> ignore the fact it starts on a duplicate cause the failsafe doesn't work either
[17:16:33] <robertmaxrees> so compare the old code against the new.
[17:16:36] <robertmaxrees> what did you change?
[17:16:50] <robertmaxrees> oh, easy.
[17:17:13] <bravvve22> can take look www.chtaybou.com
[17:17:19] <robertmaxrees> :) yeah, just compare the code.  pretty obvious why the newer version isn't disabling things.
[17:17:57] <purgedmoon> I dont have the old code, I saved over it yesterday because i'm an idiot
[17:17:59] <robertmaxrees> bravvve22 with the way this is setup, it's not going to be that easy.
[17:18:00] <c_bluntish> yesh thats exactly how i did it, again robertmaxrees knows the score ... robertmaxrees+=10;
[17:18:18] <robertmaxrees> purgedmoon erm.  you just sent one that does what you want?
[17:18:34] <purgedmoon> it does some of what I want
[17:18:39] <robertmaxrees> so what DOESN'T it do?
[17:19:01] <robertmaxrees> because the newest version just needs you to uncomment 2 lines and it's back to normal.
[17:19:31] <purgedmoon> So for example, if you have Right 2 and Left 2 you shouldn't be able to change to right or left on either
[17:19:49] <purgedmoon> currently if its right 2 and Right 2 it doesn't let you change to left which it should
[17:19:57] <robertmaxrees> sure./
[17:20:05] <robertmaxrees> so this is all being done in an overcomplicated way :)
[17:20:06] <purgedmoon> also, logic should be applying to all of the selects not just some of them
[17:20:09] <bravvve22> robertmaxrees:can explain
[17:20:16] <robertmaxrees> can you modify the markup?
[17:20:29] <purgedmoon> Somewhat
[17:20:31] <robertmaxrees> bravvve22 that frame contains another frame that contains your site.
[17:20:40] <robertmaxrees> bravvve22 so you're really not going to have access.
[17:20:59] <robertmaxrees> purgedmoon can you at least add classes?
[17:21:03] <robertmaxrees> to the selects, i mean.
[17:21:11] <bravvve22> robertmaxrees:yes,but even with just 1 frame it does not work
[17:21:25] <robertmaxrees> bravvve22 because you have to access the parent frame.
[17:21:35] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/935127/how-to-access-parent-iframe-from-javascript
[17:21:43] <purgedmoon> ya I could add classes
[17:21:55] <bravvve22> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/935127/how-to-access-parent-iframe-from-javascript
[17:21:56] <robertmaxrees> purgedmoon i'm gopnna show you something that'll make this M<UCH easier.
[17:22:00] <bravvve22> ops
[17:22:04] <purgedmoon> sure :3
[17:22:06] <robertmaxrees> purgedmoon as a freebie.
[17:22:15] <robertmaxrees> well,. i show you a basic idea.  you can expand on it.
[17:22:49] <c_bluntish> purgedmoon, the more classes you add, the more one gets out of life and the more educated one becomes .... oh you mean DOM class's, pls disregards
[17:24:27] <purgedmoon> Haha I have been looking into some classes
[17:24:59] <purgedmoon> I think intro to programming is done in python here. I'd prefer a web dev class with emphasis on like node or something
[17:25:27] <robertmaxrees> the reason they use python is because the syntax and grammar are far easier for most to understand.
[17:25:42] <robertmaxrees> and the idea for intro to programming classes is to get you to think like a programmer.
[17:26:37] <robertmaxrees> purgedmoon so
[17:26:37] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c89rfkL6/1/
[17:26:44] <robertmaxrees> this is a very basic starting point.
[17:27:00] <robertmaxrees> instead of doing those crazy each combinations, extract your log.
[17:27:01] <robertmaxrees> *logic
[17:27:26] <robertmaxrees> ah wait, you care about pairings though.
[17:27:46] <robertmaxrees> soi really.
[17:29:58] <purgedmoon> Ya the sets matter
[17:30:52] <robertmaxrees> so something like http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c89rfkL6/6/
[17:30:56] <robertmaxrees> brb
[17:32:12] <c_bluntish> purgedmoon, you are right, the more classes the better :)
[17:32:38] <robertmaxrees> so now
[17:32:39] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c89rfkL6/8/
[17:32:43] <c_bluntish> nothing like hands on learning / training and studing theory etc :)
[17:33:30] <c_bluntish> robertmaxrees will confirm, best practice's + hands on + using eval(response) on jquery success = "great success"
[17:33:37] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:33:44] <c_bluntish> :)
[17:37:39] <purgedmoon> Your array returns the first setting then the other 2 as undefined
[17:38:06] <robertmaxrees> i got lazy with adding classes lol.
[17:38:41] <purgedmoon> I see, I'll give that  a try
[17:38:45] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c89rfkL6/13/
[17:39:33] <purgedmoon> This is pretty cool
[17:41:43] <robertmaxrees> get the idea?
[17:41:58] <robertmaxrees> this way you get structured data.
[17:42:10] <purgedmoon> ya
[17:42:29] <purgedmoon> I gotta see if I can do it though, I'm generating the form with a template engine
[17:42:47] <purgedmoon> So I gotta see if I can add classes in a similar way without redoing my tpl
[17:45:03] <robertmaxrees> you should be able to.
[17:45:07] <robertmaxrees> and add those "grouping" divs.
[18:07:04] <c_bluntish> meh, hate it when you dl a jquery addon and its regex is off
[18:07:22] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:08:06] <c_bluntish> https://jqueryvalidation.org its regex for checking valid email sucks, [string]'@'[string] is valid email
[18:08:13] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:09:49] <robertmaxrees> that's not necessarily *incorrect* fwiw.
[18:09:50] <c_bluntish> does not check it has a domain eg blah@blah is a valid email address
[18:09:50] <c_bluntish> yes it is! hehe
[18:09:50] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:09:50] <robertmaxrees> that's actually valid.
[18:09:50] <robertmaxrees> per ietf
[18:09:51] <c_bluntish> what do they know?
[18:09:51] <robertmaxrees> username@server is a valid email address without a TLD.
[18:09:51] <robertmaxrees> you just don't see that format very often any more.
[18:10:33] <c_bluntish> that isnt really valid, as the dns would not know where to route the email, as server is not a valid domain
[18:10:34] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating concepts :)
[18:10:34] <c_bluntish> no
[18:10:34] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[18:10:34] <c_bluntish> :p
[18:10:34] <c_bluntish> no!
[18:10:34] <robertmaxrees> original email implementations were intranet only.
[18:10:35] <robertmaxrees> the spec, therefore, assumes that you don't need a told if you don't need it.
[18:10:35] <c_bluntish> yeah, which is soo outdated, like omg!
[18:10:35] <c_bluntish> jk
[18:10:35] <robertmaxrees> you can still do custom internal domains without a tld.
[18:10:35] <robertmaxrees> so yes, uname@server is valid.
[18:10:35] <c_bluntish> meh
[18:10:36] <robertmaxrees> it, however, may not be valid for *your* use case.
[18:10:43] <c_bluntish> not valid outside of an intranet scope
[18:10:55] <robertmaxrees> that's not really the email spec's concern :)
[18:11:10] <robertmaxrees> if the provided one is insufficient, use your own :)
[18:12:29] <c_bluntish> well (having a moan here) modern day email format is understood to be <usr>@<domain>.<tld>, I think using an old intranet / ancient definition isnt applicable to modern day understanding of correct email ...
[18:12:32] <c_bluntish> </rant>
[18:12:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:12:39] <robertmaxrees> that's not old.
[18:12:46] <c_bluntish> tiz
[18:12:49] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[18:12:53] <c_bluntish> yeps
[18:12:54] <robertmaxrees> that's still a valid way to do things :)
[18:13:22] <c_bluntish> ok show me an email address I could send a message to that is <usr>@<domain> without a tld
[18:13:29] <robertmaxrees> again
[18:13:31] <c_bluntish> meh
[18:13:34] <c_bluntish> and pah
[18:13:39] <robertmaxrees> https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822
[18:14:48] <robertmaxrees> if you'd like your email validation to require a tld, feel free to override the default :) problem solved!
[18:15:08] <c_bluntish> NOT ACCEPTABLE!
[18:15:16] <c_bluntish> :)
[18:15:54] <c_bluntish> I know, I could override the default!
[18:15:59] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:16:33] <c_bluntish> still a rubbish definition for email
[18:16:38] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[18:16:47] <robertmaxrees> you realize that's the literal spec, right?
[18:16:50] <c_bluntish> im going to contact em, saying its naff see what they get send me back
[18:16:53] <c_bluntish> yes hehe
[18:16:56] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:17:04] <c_bluntish> lets see their response
[18:17:12] <robertmaxrees> LMAO
