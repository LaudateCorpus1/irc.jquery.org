[00:06:54] <jak2000> i have an array with 3 elements how to add 1 more element at the first position?
[00:48:46] <pavonia> array.unshift(elem)
[00:56:17] <jak2000> thx
[00:56:19] <jak2000> pavo..
[01:30:31] <tw2113> anyone awake? :D
[01:33:00] <tw2113> i have hover/touchevent issues with regards to links, trying to work out how to handle things.
[04:30:10] <Triffid_Hunter> hi all, having difficulties with a jquery-ui autocomplete. At http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source it says I can pass a list of {label: blah, value: blah} and it'll show the labels but place the value, however it seems to ignore the value. If I hook the 'select' event, ui.item has both label and value set to the same value, the text of the 'label' item I supply. my value is gone
[04:34:39] <Triffid_Hunter> any ideas how to make it use my value, like it says in the documentation?
[04:41:02] <Cork> Triffid_Hunter: the label is for the dropdown
[04:41:14] <Cork> the value is then returned as the result of the selection
[04:42:08] <Cork> you can include any arbitrary data in the object if you want, but only those two have predefined usages (you can access them in the formater function
[04:43:53] <Triffid_Hunter> Cork: yeah that's how it's supposed to work, but it's returning the label and ignoring my value
[04:44:11] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/qguv78pd/1/
[04:44:40] <Cork> (type ex. g)
[04:47:24] <Triffid_Hunter> Cork: hm it works there, howcome it won't work on my site?
[04:47:45] <Cork> cause you're doing something differently :)
[04:48:05] <Cork> make sure you haven't written Label for example
[04:48:18] <Cork> it _IS_ case sensitive
[04:48:40] <Cork> (same for Value)
[04:50:08] <Triffid_Hunter> Cork: https://bpaste.net/show/7041d9ca27da <-- code. yep I'm well used to case sensitive stuff
[04:50:42] <Cork> Triffid_Hunter: try reproducing the problem in a jsfiddle
[04:50:52] <Cork> basically all the recommendations i can give you
[05:01:26] <Triffid_Hunter> Cork: works in the jsfiddle, after I hammered on CORS for a while.. afaik my jquery-ui is the same version as jsfiddle (1.12.1) and I just updated jquery to 3.3.1
[05:01:33] <Triffid_Hunter> so I have no idea what's going on now
[05:02:04] <Cork> i would recommend adding a console.log(JSON.stringify(resultArray)
[05:02:11] <Cork> and reuse the exact same array
[05:02:18] <Cork> it is most likely there the problem comes from
[05:19:32] <Triffid_Hunter> Cork: ah I found it.. someone else on the project had put a *different* autocomplete on the same element name in another template file in a different directory, was overwriting my one :/
[05:24:46] <Cork> :)
[10:26:48] <WebDragon> any owlcarousel people here that could help me with a really weird bug, causing it to wrap the content twice ?
[10:27:22] <preference> WebDragon: i use owl carousel, but i'm not an expert.
[10:27:34] <preference> when you say "wrap the content twice", can you provide a jsfiddle?
[10:27:37] <preference> https://jsfiddle.net/
[10:27:50] <WebDragon> yeah neither am I. it's been working fine, but suddenly the live site gets wrapped twice and devel does not
[10:28:03] <WebDragon> preference: I can send you to the live and devel sites to compare the two instances
[10:28:21] <preference> ya, feel free to /query me if you'd rather not put it in here
[10:28:26] <preference> (channel is logged)
[10:28:30] <WebDragon> I'm pulling an instagram feed and wrapping it with owl carousel to get it to display in a particular way
[10:28:33] <WebDragon> sure one sec
[10:47:12] <mdunham> good mornign
[11:08:26] <jomofcw> Hello !
[11:09:54] <jomofcw> I'm using "$myRadio.prop('checked',true)" on a radio input. But it seems to do nothing : the element still no have the checked attribute and "$myRadio.prop('checked')" return me undefined... Am I wrong on the use of prop there, please ?
[11:10:24] <taplar> got a fiddle?
[11:10:32] <taplar> setting the prop would not affect the attribute
[11:16:55] <jomofcw> taplar hello !
[11:17:01] <jomofcw> Shit... in this test it works :/ : https://codepen.io/anon/pen/OErQra
[11:17:54] <jomofcw> OK I was wrong, the problem isn't about the checked prop, it's about the fact it doesn't proc the change event... is it normal ?
[11:18:06] <taplar> yep
[11:18:17] <taplar> events are triggered by user actions
[11:18:31] <taplar> if you want an event to happen because of a logical change, you have to manually trigger them
[11:18:42] <jomofcw> taplar, OK, thanks ^^ !
[11:19:07] <jomofcw> Work fine, thanks !
[11:19:14] <jomofcw> I have to go. Have a nice week end !
[11:19:34] <taplar> u2
[14:16:58] <sugardrunk> hello people, is there a nice way to prevent keyup event occuring when focuss is on the input field? I tried with .focus (for the ID) and .off("keyup") but it prevents even typing to the textfield
[14:17:07] <sugardrunk> *keyup events
[14:17:23] <robertmaxrees> sugardrunk what did you put in the .focus handler?
[14:17:25] <sugardrunk> as now my code is registering them all and preventing typing to the input field
[14:17:46] <robertmaxrees> wait huh?
[14:17:56] <robertmaxrees> you mean prevent keyup only when on a particular field?
[14:17:59] <sugardrunk> oh $("#id).focus(function){
[14:18:01] <sugardrunk> yea
[14:18:05] <sugardrunk> all the keyups
[14:18:15] <sugardrunk> as now I am counting all the keys and user can press them
[14:18:23] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:18:25] <sugardrunk> need to disable that when on focus
[14:18:30] <sugardrunk> on the input field
[14:18:31] <robertmaxrees> why not fix your binding to not listen on that input.
[14:18:41] <sugardrunk> but how
[14:18:48] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle and shoe me what you've got?
[14:18:50] <robertmaxrees> *show
[14:18:52] <sugardrunk> hmm
[14:18:55] <sugardrunk> maybe later a bit
[14:18:59] <sugardrunk> still a mes
[14:19:01] <sugardrunk> *mess
[14:19:02] <sugardrunk> :D
[14:20:13] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:20:29] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like your event handler might be bound to the wrong inputs?
[14:20:38] <robertmaxrees> kind of a strange request heh
[14:21:02] <sugardrunk> it is bound to the whole document like pressing a key and it checks it
[14:21:27] <sugardrunk> just need that disabled when input is focused :(
[14:21:31] <sugardrunk> but no idea what to do
[14:21:57] <robertmaxrees> aaaaah.
[14:22:53] <robertmaxrees> okay so.
[14:22:54] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/nva9m0we/1/
[14:23:02] <robertmaxrees> you have something like this, right?
[14:23:27] <robertmaxrees> (super simplified)
[14:23:52] <sugardrunk> yep
[14:24:44] <robertmaxrees> alright, so first off - you don't want to disable anything, you just don't want to run that logic when the even happens in a particular input.
[14:24:49] <sugardrunk> but the input is created dynamically... but I do get the console message of course
[14:24:56] <sugardrunk> yea true
[14:24:58] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:25:06] <sugardrunk> lol
[14:25:16] <robertmaxrees> so really, just check to see if the event happened within the input.
[14:25:41] <sugardrunk> hmm
[14:25:46] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:25:54] <sugardrunk> yea never met this "problem" before
[14:25:56] <sugardrunk> but ok :)
[14:25:58] <sugardrunk> I try that
[14:26:05] <sugardrunk> thanks
[14:26:06] <robertmaxrees> it's not terribly uncommon.
[14:26:33] <sugardrunk> yea
[14:26:45] <sugardrunk> long time since I programmed anything
[14:28:26] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/nva9m0we/5/
[14:28:30] <robertmaxrees> ^ freebie
[14:28:40] <sugardrunk> uh nice :)
[15:23:51] <sugardrunk> robertmaxrees: thanks, works now. needed to modify a bit and add return false;
[15:26:22] <taplar> you could also do a delegate on ':not(:input)'
[15:26:39] <sugardrunk> thanks, may check that :)
[15:29:44] <taplar> or i thought you could.  it's being weird for me
[15:30:57] <taplar> aah, nvm.  propagation is messing it up.  so you have to do that
[15:35:37] <robertmaxrees> ^'
[15:41:54] <robertmaxrees> so glad it's friday
[15:42:08] <taplar> yep
[15:43:06] <robertmaxrees> have a good week taplar
[15:43:06] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:43:17] <taplar> it's been weird
[15:43:28] <robertmaxrees> oh?
[15:43:43] <taplar> i heard mention of a11y on SO and was kinda like 'wonder what that is'.
[15:44:10] <robertmaxrees> ah!  accessibility is a big dead :)
[15:44:13] <taplar> and then the next day or something i just happened to be in an accessability video thing
[15:44:36] <taplar> and that after noon and the next day I was trolling youtube watching videos about it and aria and all that
[15:45:14] <taplar> i'm like a child again, lost in the wilderness of code, lol
[15:45:23] <jak2000> offtopic question about mysql/mariadb, accepted?
[15:45:24] <robertmaxrees> hahaha.
[15:46:07] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 eeeehhhh
[15:46:10] <robertmaxrees> depenmds?
[15:46:14] <robertmaxrees> *depends
[15:46:24] <taplar> idk anything about mariadb
[15:46:27] <jak2000> can ask? pls
[15:46:33] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 sure?
[15:46:40] <jak2000> i have this scenario: https://paste.debian.net/1031356/    my question is how to update mytable, columns: pzasbas and kgsbas  with data of mytable2 columns: pzasbas and kgsbas      the key is: mytable.impedidoid =mytable2.impedidoid2 and mytable.dfecha     =mytable2.dbasculafecha and mytable.icodprod = mytable2.ibasculaidprod2    any advice? thanks
[15:46:51] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:47:07] <robertmaxrees> ask in #mysql
[15:47:23] <taplar> so you are wanting to update table 1 with table 2 data, where two fields are equal?
[15:47:49] <jak2000> yes
[15:48:07] <jak2000> robertmaxrees banned from #mysql not know why i have years been banned :(
[15:48:10] <taplar> that's a fairly simple sql statement.  #mysql should definitely be able to help with that
[15:48:27] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 dunno what to tell you then :(
[15:48:41] <jak2000> ok, forget the question... thanks and understand
[15:48:56] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11709043/mysql-update-column-with-value-from-another-table#19346375
[15:49:00] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:49:23] <jak2000> ok, reding,
[15:49:36] <jak2000> return on a mooment... go to bedroom..
[15:49:38] <jak2000> thanks
[15:51:29] <taplar> i think my main concern right now is trying to understand how a11y or aria works with media queries
[15:51:56] <robertmaxrees> depends on the browser.
[15:52:13] <robertmaxrees> but most of the time, it's largely dependent on markup, not css.
[15:53:06] <taplar> well, the situation i'm thinking about is with my app.  i have a media query on there where if the user's screen width is < 360, i hide the app and show a message saying the app wants a min width of 360
[15:53:33] <taplar> i'm just not sure how that will play with screen readers.  then again, i'm thinking about someone resizing the app, which a normal app user would not be doing
[15:53:42] <taplar> though they could rotate
[15:54:16] <robertmaxrees> could always test it.
[15:54:36] <taplar> i definitely need to get some screen reader to test with
[15:54:50] <robertmaxrees> do you have an iphone
[15:54:51] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:54:54] <taplar> android
[15:55:08] <taplar> i thought about downloading ChromeVox, but I saw a lot of bad reviews for it
[15:55:39] <robertmaxrees> you have a built-in screen ready fwiw
[15:55:41] <robertmaxrees> *readee
[15:55:47] <robertmaxrees> wtf **reader
[15:55:53] <taplar> oh?
[15:56:00] <taplar> you mean windows narrator?
[15:56:18] <robertmaxrees> i thought oyu were talking about mobile.
[15:56:19] <robertmaxrees> my bad.
[15:56:23] <taplar> both, :)
[15:56:31] <taplar> android has a built in one?
[15:56:33] <robertmaxrees> ah - android has one built-in.
[15:56:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[15:56:48] <robertmaxrees> settings -> accessibility.  should carry over to the browser iirc.
[15:57:00] <robertmaxrees> https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2633135?hl=en
[16:10:44] <taplar> niice
[16:11:38] <robertmaxrees> one of my coworkers once worked at a place that had a blind engineer on staff that helped with this kind of stuff.
[16:12:23] <robertmaxrees> he's had some good info for uss.
[16:14:51] <taplar> yeaaaaah, it's terrible, lol
[16:15:32] <taplar> mmm, i didn't realize i was developing a d-do planner
[16:16:05] <robertmaxrees> hah
[16:17:51] <scetian> hi guys I am using this (https://github.com/collab-project/videojs-record) plugin to record video from browser. No I want to show a tooltip on its record button. Having a hard time doing this. Can anyone guide me in the right direction plz?
[16:22:27] <taplar> do you have any selector you can use to target the record button?
[16:22:42] <taplar> i'd look myself, but i'm not allowing anything access to my camera
[16:22:49] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:24:21] <scetian> yes the button has a particular class
[16:24:33] <robertmaxrees> then target that class.
[16:25:21] <scetian> yes I tried but i get this error: "Uncaught TypeError: f.getClientRects is not a function"
[16:25:38] <taplar> errr
[16:25:41] <robertmaxrees> are the controls canvas/svg?
[16:26:44] <scetian> no its plain html but theres a <video> tag which contains all of this
[16:27:17] <robertmaxrees> are you initing the tooltip before the button exists?
[16:27:31] <scetian> https://gyazo.com/7873607c9e3caf2b600e0809c83d9d50 screenshot of markup
[16:27:45] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[16:27:50] <robertmaxrees> doesn't answer my question :)
[16:28:30] <scetian> im sorry. but I dont see any canvas or svg tag in markup
[16:29:00] <robertmaxrees> my second question
[16:30:14] <scetian> oh sorry about that didnt saw that one. To answer your question, no im not. I initiate it after the player and all controls show up
[16:31:08] <robertmaxrees> have you console.log'd the length of the selector?
[16:31:25] <scetian> it shows the tooltip but outside the player area https://gyazo.com/f3a0018400f480002c48e64868674ade
[16:31:47] <scetian> umm no how to do that? and by selector you mean the record button right?
[16:32:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:32:25] <scetian> ok let me check
[16:32:38] <robertmaxrees> wait
[16:32:41] <robertmaxrees> wait wait wait
[16:32:49] <robertmaxrees> are you using jquery ui?
[16:32:58] <scetian> yep
[16:33:10] <robertmaxrees> i'ma guess a version pre 1.12?
[16:33:22] <robertmaxrees> with jquery 3.x ?
[16:33:34] <scetian> exactly
[16:33:38] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37914869/jquery-ui-error-f-getclientrects-is-not-a-function
[16:33:38] <scetian> you're right
[16:33:47] <robertmaxrees> that's why you're seeing that error.
[16:34:22] <scetian> oh.. thanks man :) I'll check
[16:34:33] <robertmaxrees> searching error messages is helpful sometimes ;)
[16:37:19] <scetian> actually I did and the link you sent is still opened in another tab but in the question I saw angular and I totally ignored it lol :P
[16:37:28] <scetian> but still bro thanks alot
[16:37:33] <robertmaxrees> rad
