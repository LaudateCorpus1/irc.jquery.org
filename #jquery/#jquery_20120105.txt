[00:01:49] <idan> Hey folks -- I'm trying to build a charting widget library on top of d3, this is my first time using widgets (vs plugins), gotta question:
[00:02:36] <idan> in plugins, I'd be passing the data to be charted in with the options dict, but with a widget, it seems like that's inelegant
[00:02:53] <idan> should I be passing the data as an arg to the widget's _create? Is that legal?
[00:03:06] <geoid> greetz
[00:04:27] <geoid> working with jquery.ui.selectable
[00:04:27] <geoid> ... how can I tell which <li> has been selected in a <ul> that is made selectable? Specifically I want to check whether a child of contained <li> has been clicked and stop the selectable event if so.
[00:04:41] <TahitiPetey> I'm using $.getJSON(url, function(data) { /*blah blah*/ }); to fetch a JSON object. It doesn't always succeed, but I *always* want a particular function to be run after the callback is received, regardless of whether it succeeds or fails. How would I do that?
[00:05:24] <idan> TahitiPetey: use .ajax
[00:05:49] <idan> getJSON is something of a shortcut, underneath it's doing .ajax with some default options.
[00:05:49] <TahitiPetey> idan: Okay, I'm guessing in that case I can provide a failure callback? Would I have to modify any other code, or would it still be fine?
[00:06:38] <idan> TahitiPetey: yup.
[00:06:52] <idan> Sorry, yes -- you do provide a failure callback
[00:07:10] <TahitiPetey> idan: Cool, thanks :). I'll take a look
[00:07:19] <idan> Effectively converting a getJSON to .ajax is just about setting the relevant arguments to .ajax
[00:08:54] <idan> TahitiPetey: specifically you want xhr.always()
[00:08:55] <TahitiPetey> So I would have to manually call $.parseJSON if I use $.ajax, correct?
[00:10:16] <idan> TahitiPetey: I think so, haven't tried.
[00:10:28] <TahitiPetey> Okay, I'll give it a shot. Thanks for the pointers :).
[00:10:31] <idan> It makes sense, ajax returns the raw response.
[00:10:49] <idan> TahitiPetey: no prob.
[00:13:20] <geoid> anyone here good with events?
[00:13:46] <patbam> i threw a knitting party once
[00:13:54] <patbam> badum dum
[00:14:08] <geoid> I'll take that as "yes, ask me, ask me!" :p
[00:14:28] <geoid> I'm fetching an event like so:
[00:14:29] <geoid> jQuery(taskFolder).data('events');
[00:15:05] <geoid> but console.log(event. isPropagationStopped() )   doesn't seem to exist
[00:15:09] <geoid> what am I missing?
[00:16:13] <geoid> the error says: has no method 'isPropagationStopped'
[00:17:49] <Zogot> put it in a line after it?
[00:17:53] <Zogot> ops
[00:17:54] <Zogot> ignore that
[00:18:06] <geoid> so how is it that my event doesn't have the expected methods once it's fetched?
[00:21:57] <geoid> anyone... anyone... :-/
[00:22:40] <geoid> or let me ask the question in a different way... how do I fetch a valid event object from an element?
[00:30:31] <c0mmunytj> ciao !list
[00:33:03] <Shagshag> Hello, cross domain ajax doesn't work with Opera, is there a way to make it works ? it works ok for FF, Chrome, Safary
[00:43:39] <demorose> hi
[00:54:21] <demorose> Do someone know a good tutorial (or a solution) to load content when user scroll to the bottom of a div (overflow-y: scroll).
[00:56:47] <geoid> what does the comma inside this do?
[00:56:48] <geoid> $(this.options.handle, currentItem);
[00:58:18] <TahitiPetey> geoid: That's the argument delimeter. It tells the function that you are now giving it a second argument, after the comma.
[00:58:39] <TahitiPetey> geoid: That's basic programming syntax, you might want to go through some programming tutorials.
[00:58:46] <geoid> yar.. I know that :)  but what does it mean in the context of $
[00:59:01] <geoid> i.e. what does jQuery do with the second argument?
[00:59:17] <TahitiPetey> geoid: Oh, look it up on the API.
[00:59:25] <TahitiPetey> API docs*
[01:00:29] <geoid> I did, of course. I only ask questions here when Google or API reference fails to enlighten.
[01:01:26] <geoid> I don't understand what this means from the API: "context: A DOM Element, Document, or jQuery to use as context"... what is this "context"
[01:07:09] <shesek_> geoid, I'm assuming you're talking about the second argument to $()? It sets the context in which to search for DOM element
[01:07:40] <shesek_> For example, $('p', div) would look for 'p' elements under the `div` element
[01:07:52] <geoid> ok, i c. thx
[01:08:06] <shesek_> Like what $(div).find('p') would do (in fact, it internally delegates there)
[01:16:12] <timing> Hi all
[01:16:32] <timing> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/2747 it looks like this bug is introduced again?
[01:22:06] <timing> FUCKING ANOYING ASS SPAM PROTECTION ON THE BTS!
[01:22:12] <Shwaiil> hi guys
[01:38:03] <Shwaiil> Q: is there any diference between using an anonymous function and .ready() ? On jquery docs, looks like its saying its the same?! Thank you!
[01:38:13] <Shwaiil> http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[01:40:42] <angelkoilov> Shwaiil: docs say .ready is for dom element
[01:42:01] <Shwaiil> angelkoilov: tks for looking
[01:42:31] <dharmesh> hello
[01:42:56] <dharmesh> anybody has single page application tutorial with asp.net
[01:43:55] <angelkoilov> try http://asp.net/
[01:44:42] <beeviz> uuuhm, any idea? i'm starting an $.ajax() request
[01:44:45] <Shwaiil> Q: On .ready or anonymous function, for a .show() call, I have it working when setting it in timeout only, check http://pastie.org/private/y2jjkyoejxas5wkoslbw
[01:44:51] <beeviz> the server http response is 200 OK
[01:45:02] <Shwaiil> the commented one works while the other doesnt. Anyone understand the reason for that ?
[01:45:06] <beeviz> but my success callback wont be executed but the error callback instead
[01:45:12] <Shwaiil> Tested with doc ready too
[01:45:12] <mehrdad_> i hate js
[01:45:34] <Shwaiil> angelkoilov: I would appreciate any comments on this one :) thats why I asked that above =)
[01:46:02] <dharmesh> how to load javascript on specified order
[01:46:32] <poppiez> I have this function: http://pastie.org/private/i1mxix4kqbqaoudg0atqw. firefox can't seem to handle this. it says img.complete is true for an image that has previously been fetched, and thereby returns right away but it still downloads the entire image. so loadImage fires the callback right away but it takes 2-3 secs before the image is ready. can anyone identify the problem?
[01:48:43] <angelkoilov> Shwaiil: do u manipulate these elements with js ?
[01:48:43] <angelkoilov> e.g. creating, changing classes....
[01:48:57] <Dunstkreis> also it could be a simple JS problem, not jQuery, could somebody tell me how to set the position of the actual viewport? i wanna go back to the top of the page after an ajax request ...
[01:49:29] <Shwaiil> angelkoilov: i'll disable js for awhile to test if its server side
[01:49:53] <angelkoilov> could be js too
[01:50:18] <angelkoilov> add console.log after selection
[01:50:26] <Shwaiil> angelkoilov: yeah..that was the issue
[01:50:38] <Shwaiil> its being manipulated client side
[01:50:43] <Shwaiil> so thats why I need the timeout :P
[01:50:58] <Shwaiil> thanks: )
[01:51:03] <angelkoilov> :)
[01:51:12] <angelkoilov> issue resolved
[01:51:18] <angelkoilov> will back to work :)
[01:59:45] <Anime> is there a way to prevent jquery setting display: block when fading in an element?
[02:06:45] <_johnny> hi guys, i'm trying to sort an array of objects based on a property, however this doesn't seem to change anything, no matter what i set my sort function to return (-1, 0, +1) http://jsfiddle.net/RjQFk/1/ any hints as to what i'm doing wrong?
[02:18:58] <Axsuul> what's a good plugin for keyboard shortcuts?
[02:21:02] <mattyh88> hey i have this piece of code: http://pastebin.com/jMpgJysW
[02:21:03] <mattyh88> but for some reason the class linethrough doesn't get removed from the label
[02:21:16] <mattyh88> when it's checked
[02:23:02] <lala> hi everyone!
[02:25:14] <geoid> mattyh88 what's with the "+ label" bit?
[02:25:58] <mattyh88> geoid: i use that for my radiobuttons also and seems to work there .. read it somewhere, don't know where anymore though
[02:26:27] <geoid> well do a console.log on your selector and make sure it's selecting.
[02:26:37] <geoid> that's almost certainly the problem
[02:26:58] <mattyh88> hm .. but won't it just try to remove the class from the element itself and not from the label?
[02:27:10] <mattyh88> i think that's what the + label part do
[02:27:14] <mattyh88> *does
[02:27:36] <geoid> it will remove the class from whatever it selects. So do console.log($('#template_agreement_external_speaker_independent:checked + label'))
[02:27:37] <geoid> to see what's being selected
[02:27:55] <geoid> that will show you the element it's trying to remove it from
[02:28:47] <mazzachre> A quick question... I have a custom implemented select, how can I make it hide the select list when the user clicks outside the element? Like a normal select list disapears when it looses focus.
[02:29:25] <edzjins> hi
[02:29:37] <geoid> mazzachre I would guess – make sure it has focus and then give it an event listener for unfocus.
[02:29:43] <lala> hi edzjins
[02:30:10] <edzjins> got a bug. link - http://www.latvenergo.lv/gramatas/gramata_34/
[02:30:17] <edzjins> go to page 42
[02:30:32] <mazzachre> geoid: But how do I make a list <ul> focus and unfocus? It is not a normal form element
[02:30:36] <edzjins> you see a part of page 43 to the right. a blue line.
[02:31:04] <edzjins> all the widths are correct, and margin-left is also correct, but i really can't figure out why it does like that.
[02:31:11] <geoid> mazzachre just do $('#myelement').trigger('focus');
[02:31:23] <geoid> I think
[02:33:13] <edzjins> anybody could know what is wrong, what do i have to do different?
[02:36:15] <mattyh88> geoid: i just see "[]" in the console.log
[02:36:30] <geoid> mattyh88 then your selector is broken
[02:36:50] <mattyh88> ah no sorry
[02:36:54] <mattyh88> i see [object object] now
[02:37:03] <geoid> you need to play with it till it returns the correct element
[02:37:17] <geoid> shouldn't be returning an object, should be an element.
[02:38:50] <shal3r> Is it ok if $('#select-field-with-no-selected-value').val() returns 'undefined' but with typeof 'string' ?
[02:39:19] <edzjins> anybody?
[02:39:53] <shal3r> edzjins, jo tarifi ir pārāk augsti
[02:39:57] <mattyh88> geoid: okay got the element when i delete the "+ label" but i'd like to remove a class from the label of course
[02:40:01] <mattyh88> i'll try some more
[02:40:05] <edzjins> lol, nepalīdzēja.
[02:40:33] <geoid> mattyh88 what is label? Is that a class or id?
[02:40:48] <mattyh88> the label of the element :)
[02:41:04] <shal3r> edzjins, i guess it's because of your actual width values like 1.666666667%
[02:41:05] <mattyh88> geoid: this <label for="template_agreement_external_speaker_independent" class="linethrough">onafhankelijke</label>
[02:41:19] <geoid> ok.. give me your working selector for the label's parent
[02:41:31] <edzjins> shal3r i changed them to fixed pixel values, still the same
[02:41:35] <woozly> how to check has element bind event or not?
[02:41:36] <mattyh88> geoid: the label's parent? :)
[02:42:03] <woozly> because I launch rebind events everytime when something changes... and it has 2 and more loops of event
[02:42:08] <geoid> mattyh88 paste your code into pastie.org m8ey, then I can help you
[02:42:29] <geoid> include the elements in question and the js code, as snippets is fine
[02:42:56] <shal3r> edzjins, your .pages element is 1px bigger than .page. Just try to set .page width to 940px
[02:43:28] <mazzachre> No effect, I don't get a focusout or blur event when I click outside my list.
[02:44:25] <geoid> mazzachre uize framework has this feature, I don't think jQuery supports it.
[02:45:08] <edzjins> shal3r, they're not fixed. i'm calculating them depending on window height, then assigning the same exact value to both .pages and .page
[02:45:53] <edzjins> there's a percentage version where you're looking, but i'm having the pixel version here on my localhost, and it's still the same
[02:46:51] <mazzachre> geoid: Hmmm, what to do then? Since I am using jqeury :)
[02:46:52] <shal3r> edzjins, anyway, in page 42 your actual width of .page is 929px while .page is 930px. That's there you see that blue line
[02:47:04] <geoid> mazzachre switch to uize :p
[02:48:02] <geoid> mazzachre google "jquery click outside"
[02:48:10] <geoid> you heard of them? Google.. they good. :p
[02:48:13] <geoid> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/152975/how-to-detect-a-click-outside-an-element
[02:49:46] <woozly> Huys
[02:49:47] <woozly> Guys
[02:49:53] <woozly> how to rebind events?
[02:50:12] <woozly> if I add new element which must to have click event listener
[02:50:46] <shal3r> woozly, run .bind() again or use .live()
[02:52:52] <AdvoWork> how can i check a variable is in the interval of a value? meaning if my check is 10, the values can be 10,20, 50, 1010, but not 15 if you get me?
[02:52:59] <Anime> use .on, not .live
[02:53:44] <udp> AdvoWork: value % 10 == 0
[02:56:08] <edzjins> shal3r, no, it's something else. ok, i'll just do something and hope it works in the end of the day.. thanks for help.
[02:56:54] <AdvoWork> udp, like: if(test % 10 != 0) { document.write("Value Not In Range");} ?
[02:57:07] <udp> sure
[03:10:51] <mazzachre> geoid: Ya, that sort of works... except when inside a modal dialog, where the clicks outside the window is already being ignored :) Well, I am handling it "sorta"
[03:13:52] <Trudko> guys I have existing element in which I want to change name attribute but because of IE bug I can't do it using prop but I have to use using text
[03:15:07] <Trudko> do I have to remember al attribues and then recreate it  -> var id = element.id ->$("<div id=" + id + " etc ...?
[03:15:52] <geoid> Trudko wtf?   can't you just do $('el').attr('name','newname');
[03:16:07] <Trudko> no I can't there is IE bug and jquery is not handling it
[03:16:23] <Trudko> at least not version I have to use
[03:16:34] <geoid> sheesh
[03:16:46] <geoid> well I think $('el').attr() will return all your attributes.
[03:22:18] <shesek> Trudko, you mean <input> type?
[03:22:30] <Trudko> shesek: ?
[03:22:54] <shesek> n/m
[03:24:40] <Trudko> n/m?
[03:28:57] <risky_s> hi, how do I check that a user had chosen a different item from a select box, however my select box is custom made of div's and ul?
[03:36:30] <john_12> hi, how do I check that a li has a value?
[03:36:54] <shesek> john_12, "has a value"?
[03:37:20] <timing> probably this: $('li').text() != ''
[03:37:22] <john_12> ?
[03:37:45] <timing> john_12: it's unclear what you mean with "has a value"
[03:37:51] <timing> when is a value a value :-)
[03:37:58] <john_12> i mean when you a a unordered list
[03:38:11] <john_12> you have <li value="1"></li>
[03:41:07] <iavana> hi all
[03:43:49] <timing> john_12: li doesn't allow value="" (i think there are some exceptions), anyway, $('li').hasAttr('value'); is to see if the element has that attribute
[03:44:27] <Zogot> Some new people here today.  Would love some feedback on http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/aFNwA/ and if there may be something i'm missing about Object Literals, primarily about how not to have a huge amount in the global namespace
[03:44:52] <john_12> cheers
[03:46:32] <ssj> can anyone tell me how can i find the max value of a drop down list?
[03:53:49] <udp> Zogot: what do you mean?
[03:54:56] <stanman246> hi i have several <tr parent="66">'s which i want to hide, how do i select them? $("[parent='66']").hide() doesn't work :(
[03:55:38] <havel> Has anyone got an example of jQuery form (ajaxForm) being used with history.js (or indeed pushState in general)?
[03:56:04] <udp> stanman246: I don't think you need those single quotes around 66
[03:56:33] <Zogot> udp:  Well it was my understanding(although I may be wrong, still quite new to this) that I'm putting everything under the global access, and there is a better way to segregate it (anonymous functions? namespacing?) although I couldn't find much about it in regards to the Object Literal way of doing JS
[03:56:57] <udp> Zogot: put it in a closure if you want
[03:57:10] <stanman246> udp, hmm... it keeps giving me a null typeerror...
[03:57:52] <udp> Zogot: something like http://jsfiddle.net/aFNwA/9/
[03:58:15] <udp> Zogot: then your var is local to the closure, and won't pollute the global namespace
[03:59:28] <Zogot> And if I want to reference it from another (for example, under the resize, due to the way that twitter bootstrap tabs handles its views, it causes the map to not show correctly, and I am current calling googelmaps.resize in the bootstrap js)
[03:59:38] <Zogot> Or does that mean it needs to be in the global?
[03:59:51] <JSM87> Hi guys, im using this plugin http://www.gmarwaha.com/jquery/jcarousellite/js/jcarousellite_1.0.1.js # I set the option auto:1 - My question is how can I create a button to dynamicically change the auto parameter? Can someone please help

[04:08:47] <CapsuleNZ> Hey guys
[04:09:03] <Zogot> Kingsy: isn't tabs a jquery ui?
[04:09:40] <Zogot> Oh, it is ticked, sorry didn't notice
[04:09:54] <iavana> i neetd help for my form any on can help me?
[04:10:29] <CapsuleNZ> I'm having a issue with .html(someHTMLElements); it's not 'evaluating' the the HTML, it's almost as if it's getting set as text, I need to change the elements inside of the parent <div>
[04:11:06] <aleray> hi, do you know any plugin that deals with zoomable content, like google maps but for html content ?
[04:11:21] <udp> Kingsy: I think you need the jquery UI CSS to have the elements hide
[04:11:30] <aleray> I know zoomooz but that is not exactly what I want I think
[04:13:06] <aleray> and to pan as well
[04:13:08] <udp> Kingsy: http://jsfiddle.net/jY3gB/1/

[04:14:43] <CapsuleNZ> Anyone?
[04:14:45] <CapsuleNZ> I'm having a issue with .html(someHTMLElements); it's not 'evaluating' the the HTML, it's almost as if it's getting set as text, I need to change the elements inside of the parent <div>
[04:14:57] <udp> ?demo @ CapsuleNZ
[04:14:58] <bot-t> CapsuleNZ, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[04:17:53] <CapsuleNZ> up7: http://jsfiddle.net/YgQhV/ there you go :)
[04:18:49] <Trudko> Guys I have input elemenet  and I need to change its name but I can't do it using attr/prop I need to do it using text. I guess i will need first to remember all of its attributes and make string out of it. How to do that<
[04:20:01] <udp> CapsuleNZ: are you sure that's the right html?
[04:20:10] <shesek> CapsuleNZ, some of your `start_text.charAt(i)` returns `<` and `>`
[04:20:19] <udp> CapsuleNZ: that HTML looks more like the output than the input
[04:20:36] <shesek> yes, probably because of that ^
[04:20:45] <shesek> your code doesn't make sense with that HTML
[04:21:05] <CapsuleNZ> shesek: udp: Let me upload the whole page :)
[04:21:14] <udp> CapsuleNZ: did you mean to do something like this? : http://jsfiddle.net/YgQhV/1/
[04:21:20] <shesek> and you should really constructor those elements using "real" DOM methods, rather than as raw HTML
[04:21:37] <CapsuleNZ> udp: yeah
[04:21:49] <CapsuleNZ> What changed?
[04:22:02] <udp> see above
[04:24:21] <shesek> BTW, you could just '<span style="opacity:0.3">' + Array.prototype.join.call(start_text, '</span><span style="opacity:0.3">') + '</span>'
[04:24:41] <jsomers> is there a jquery 1.3.2 alternative for the $.Deferred object introduced in 1.5?
[04:25:06] <shesek> jsomers, upgrading your code to work with 1.5?
[04:25:29] <jsomers> shesek: that's not possible
[04:25:49] <shesek> Its not tightly coupled to anything in jQuery, you can just use the code on your 1.3.2 (with $.Callbacks IIRC)
[04:25:49] <jsomers> it's the version that shipped with the CMS version I'm using and I can't upgrade it
[04:26:12] <shesek> you can't upgrade the CMS or jQuery?
[04:26:54] <jsomers> shesek: both, I don't have the time or budget to upgrade the CMS, and i tried upgrading jquery once, but some things didn't work anymore
[04:27:11] <jsomers> shesek: the code I need to get working is the following: http://pastebin.com/kmZFQNSN
[04:27:42] <jsomers> so I guess that should work through $.callback
[04:27:53] <shesek> jQuery is awesomely backward-compatible, those are probably issues that're quite easy to fix
[04:28:26] <shesek> you'll be better spending your time fixing the issues caused by 1.5 than trying to get that working (and still ending up with in old version)
[04:29:52] <shesek> even tho you don't really need Deferred there
[04:30:09] <AdvoWork> if i have the id of a element, how can i change the css for that, ie change it to float:left?
[04:30:47] <udp> AdvoWork: $('#myelement').css ('float', 'left')
[04:31:18] <shesek> jsomers, http://pastebin.com/Rj562mr6
[04:31:37] <shesek> but... again, it shouldn't be hard fixing the issues with 1.5. I highly recommend you to do so
[04:32:52] <jsomers> shesek: works like a sharm! thanks!
[04:33:39] <jsomers> I once tried updating to 1.7, (well, the latest) but some CMS features which I don't maintain did not work and we are planning to upgrade the entire website during the summer
[04:33:43] <shesek> jsomers, you welcome
[04:33:53] <jsomers> so I'd rather not spend time doing that right now
[04:35:06] <Schyzo> Is there a way to test if a function exists before executing it (to prevent errors for instance) ??
[04:36:34] <havel> Has anyone got an example of jQuery form (ajaxForm) being used with history.js (or indeed pushState in general)?
[04:38:04] <shesek> Schyzo, switching to CoffeeScript, than `obj.func?()` ?
[04:38:11] <shesek> :P
[04:38:22] <shesek> Just use an `if (typeof func === '
[04:38:29] <shesek> Just use an `if (typeof func === 'function') func()` or something
[04:42:51] <Schyzo> Thank you so much shesek !!!!
[04:43:08] <Schyzo> I have been looking for that answer for an hour now !
[04:43:36] <CapsuleNZ> udp: shesek: do you know of any ways to simulate a .draggable ?
[04:44:12] <shesek> simulate?
[04:44:49] <CapsuleNZ> shesek: 2 secs let me give you some context.
[04:47:32] <CapsuleNZ> shesek: http://frequenciesapp.com/v2/ I want to simulate the 'slider' before it shows the icon view
[04:47:37] <Kingsy> can someone take a look at this --> http://www.kingsy.co.uk/cooking4life/index.php/ <-- why is the second jquery slider not appearing in ie7 ?
[04:48:07] <CapsuleNZ> shesek: (if your quick you can drag the slider with your mouse before it auto 'unlocks')
[04:48:08] <Kingsy> or any version nof ie for that matter, as far as I can see?
[04:49:11] <Kingsy> actually, it works in 7, and not in 8..
[04:50:45] <Kingsy> it works in chrome too
[04:54:45] <havel> What is a nice way to convert a form into a get request URL?
[04:55:30] <Kingsy> in ie8 I get the error "undefined is null or not an object"
[05:00:06] <CapsuleNZ> shesek: anything?
[05:01:38] <edzjins> shal3r, you'll never guess what the problem was. the images had a bug in them, so I was fixing a non-existent problem since the beginning.. time well spent, lol.
[05:04:26] <jacobrask> Isn't $('input').prop('checked') supposed to check a checkbox?
[05:05:31] <silverwind> Nope
[05:05:42] <silverwind> Just returns its current state
[05:05:52] <jacobrask> oh, tried 'checked', true
[05:05:55] <Kingsy> does anyone have an idea about my problem? I just don't get it
[05:06:16] <jeffsmykil> I'm trying to position the UI Datepicker absolutely without the wonky offset stuff that it does.  Ive tried using this with no luck: $.extend($.datepicker,{_checkOffset:function(inst,offset,isFixed){return offset}});  I'm just trying to position via the css
[05:08:00] <CapsuleNZ> Anyone here want a quick job to earn a few $$ real quick?
[05:09:17] <jeffsmykil> CapsuleNZ: there is a freelance channel somewhere on freenode
[05:11:57] <shal3r> edzjins, what kind of bug?
[05:12:41] <edzjins> the one with the slideshow, you looked at it earlier.
[05:13:05] <coppa> automatic ajax navigation plugin http://jquery-css.com/automatic-ajax-navigation the idea is to automatically transform normal page-to-page navigation to ajax. this is mobiel friendly.
[05:13:15] <coppa> well if you have any feedback don't hesitate etc
[05:22:06] <jeffsmykil> erichynds:damn national grid shut my gf propane off two nights ago
[05:22:18] <erichynds> :||||
[05:22:22] <CapsuleNZ> jeffsmykil: what was the freelance channel?
[05:22:37] <erichynds> jeffsmykil: didn't think they were allowed to do that in the winter
[05:22:52] <jeffsmykil> THEY AREN'T
[05:23:01] <jeffsmykil> then they told her yesterday they cant make it out to today
[05:23:30] <erichynds> she doesn't use propane to heat her place, does she?
[05:23:50] <jeffsmykil> um... might be?
[05:23:56] <jeffsmykil> natural gas i thought
[05:25:17] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: why do you ask?
[05:25:24] <jeffsmykil> CapsuleNZ: I can't recall off hand
[05:25:26] <erichynds> cuz it's like 0 degrees out there
[05:25:33] <erichynds> so if she didn't have heat, that would be bad!
[05:25:36] <jeffsmykil> yeah i knw
[05:25:42] <jeffsmykil> shes freezing her ass off
[05:26:10] <jeffsmykil> she cant call the city of boston 1800 number
[05:26:18] <jeffsmykil> because it only accepts calls fro within mass
[05:26:24] <jeffsmykil> and her cellphone is illinois
[05:26:29] <jeffsmykil> her roommates is california
[05:26:34] <jeffsmykil> and her other roommates is south carolina
[05:27:51] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: kind of ridiculous, you would think national grid would know that that practice is illegal during the winter months
[05:28:12] <erichynds> yeah, that's dangerous
[05:28:33] <erichynds> doesn't surprise me though
[05:28:35] <erichynds> nat grid is the worst
[05:29:46] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: wonder if she can charge them the cost of running the space heater
[05:32:16] <innociv_> I'm having issues with using tinymce with my code.  Tinymce doesn't load synchronous, so if I try to call a command on it right after laoding it fails.  Is there some sort of .. do {} until(loaded()) type thing? :/
[05:33:56] <Matiasu> Hello
[05:36:02] <pom> Can I check if an element is in the users viewport?
[05:37:05] <innociv_> compare scroll height to element position
[05:41:47] <Zogot> Is there not an easier way to submit a form via ajax that doesn't including individually declaring the inputs in the data{} in the .ajax function
[05:41:59] <Zogot> include*
[05:42:15] <pom> Zogot: Yes, there is.
[05:42:23] <pom> form.serialize() can be put as data:
[05:42:46] <Zogot> form being the $('#formid')?
[05:42:49] <pom> var form = $('form#myform');
[05:42:53] <pom> Yes.
[05:42:56] <Zogot> great
[05:42:59] <Zogot> awesome sauce
[05:43:01] <Zogot> thanks a bunch
[05:54:10] <Matiasu> is there a way to automatically cancel any ajax request that is still loading?
[05:54:51] <_ramo> hi
[05:55:06] <Matiasu> I mean, I want just one request in any given moment
[05:55:15] <_ramo> how can i set the min date in jquery ui datepicker? currently the earliest year is just 2002
[05:58:08] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: can I PM you real quick
[06:00:33] <imc> hello!
[06:02:09] <imc> a jQuery Mobile question: I'm trying to port an existing site to jQuery Mobile, It has no ReST API and was using jquery slides + History.js to handle back/fwd browser buttons for navigating between slides history
[06:02:55] <imc> now I'm doing the same thing but instead of shoing a slide, I load a <div data-role="page"> into the current DOM and the use $.mobile.changePage($('#idofslidepage'));
[06:03:21] <imc> the problem is that the navigation history does not take into account pages loaded in this way
[06:03:32] <imc> any toughts?
[06:05:53] <shesek> but any particular reason you aren't just using plain HTML files and let jQuery Mobile handle the loading?
[06:05:57] <shesek> s/but//
[06:21:18] <jomofcw> How could I cancel an ajax call please ?
[06:22:26] <coppa> var call = $.ajax({.....;
[06:22:40] <coppa> and to cancel : a.abort();
[06:22:53] <coppa> call.abort();
[06:23:15] <coppa> you can't cancel a load() though
[06:33:57] <imc> shesek: reason: we already have the web app written using Lift framework and our slides are dynamically loaded through ajax
[06:34:58] <AziaBurgi> hello guys, i am new to jquery. i want a datepicker for a web app i am building. I have managed to get the calendar to appear and to output the selected date. however the date format is in the US format and I want the UK format. here is the code i am using: http://pastebin.com/wN2PBpes can you point me in the correct direction?
[06:34:59] <imc> shesek: I just overloaded the behaviour of the class that handle slides rendering and navigation to just fill the DOM with using data-roles divs and then use $.mobile.changePage for the transition
[06:35:12] <imc> not ideal, I admit
[06:37:07] <Ozembuch> guys  i get error Object expected in jquery.min.js line 16. Obviously problem is in my code, how do I find out where? Do i have have debug code from the start?
[06:37:22] <DynamicFail> If I had a div called #vid1 and I wanted to make it draggable could I just do: function init(){ $('#vid1'.draggable {containment: '#content', cursor: 'move', revert: true } ); }
[06:37:25] <DynamicFail> ?
[06:37:35] <uchuff> AziaBurgi: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#option-dateFormat
[06:37:36] <DynamicFail> Well I thought I should be able to, but it doesn't work
[06:37:41] <uchuff> dateFormat, not formatDate
[06:39:09] <AziaBurgi> aha!
[06:39:18] <AziaBurgi> thanks uchuff
[06:39:48] <AziaBurgi> i was about to start gnawing my own keyboard there :)
[06:44:13] <DynamicFail> Can you reference a div that already exists?
[06:48:20] <Schyzo> I am trying to dynamically refresh an image with the Jcrop plugin. I roughly work but I get a weird "preview"... So I guess I do not set the new image correctly. Can anybody help me out please ?
[06:48:26] <AziaBurgi> uchuff: it works in FF but not in chrome, any idea why?
[06:48:35] <NoiseEee> DynamicFail: div "called" #vid1?
[06:49:49] <AziaBurgi> nvm i got it
[06:49:52] <ilriso> Hi!
[06:50:04] <DynamicFail> NoiseEee, correct
[06:50:10] <DynamicFail> id=vid1
[06:50:22] <ilriso> Is it possible to trigger an event after an html5 video finishes playing? Like a youtube video and then it takes you to another url?
[06:50:45] <NoiseEee> DynamicFail: and you have jqueryui included? what is the error in your console?  can you recreate on jsfiddle?
[06:51:03] <NoiseEee> ilriso: popcorn.js helps with that kind of thing
[06:51:10] <gnarf> are you ever calling init() DynamicFail?
[06:51:18] <ilriso> NoiseEee: cool, thanks
[06:51:43] <jomofcw> coppa thanks ^^
[06:52:56] <gnarf> Ozembuch: if you put chrome debugger on "pause on execptions" it will give you a chance to look at the stack that lead to your error

[06:53:08] <voronika> ilriso: have you tried video.onended?
[06:54:08] <ilriso> voronika: nope, didn't know about that
[06:54:13] <DynamicFail> gnarf, called it...
[06:54:14] <DynamicFail> lol
[06:59:42] <DynamicFail> nvm... still doesn't work
[06:59:43] <DynamicFail> http://jsfiddle.net/ENfPM/
[07:01:48] <NoiseEee> DynamicFail: a) include jquery and the UI from the "choose framework" part of jsfiddle;  b) your JS needs to run *after* the DOM has finished rendering
[07:02:31] <NoiseEee> DynamicFail: http://api.jquery.com/ready/ and other methods, ie: moving your JS to the bottom of your page before </body>

[07:05:22] <ilriso> voronika: Could you help me if I set up a jsfiddle?
[07:08:23] <Frantic> guys, does anyone know why $().scrollLeft doesn't work on IE7?
[07:09:17] <JesperA> because its IE
[07:09:19] <JesperA> sorry
[07:09:40] <Frantic> ok, but isn't jQuery supposed to have a workaround?
[07:10:47] <Frantic> sry I don't mean to whine, I'm just debugging a script that uses scrollLeft and trying to determine if there's another option for IE or I should just use position:absolute and left: -Xpx;
[07:11:33] <ilriso> any idea on how to get this working? http://jsfiddle.net/gHFVv/
[07:11:50] <fris> Frantic maybe this solution http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5663525/jquery-animate-scrollleft-bug-in-ie-and-ff
[07:16:11] <Frantic> fris I don't think that's related to my issue
[07:16:34] <Frantic> I'm just trying to determine if .scrollLeft should work on IE7, and I'm confused since I can't find people mentioning it on google
[07:19:25] <mlechner> hi, I want items dropped into a list toi be removed if dragged out of the box the list is in. How to do this? It's an extension of the jquery-ui example about draggable and sortabel (http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/sortable.html). I want the items to be removed from the list of dragged somwhere far out (of a div).
[07:20:15] <geoid> has anyone worked with jquery.ui.dialogue?
[07:20:24] <geoid> I can't get even a simple demo to work.
[07:20:44] <geoid> can someone show me a jsfiddle example of how to use it?
[07:22:30] <mlechner> geoid: what did you try? examples can be found here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/  first initialize the elemant as dialog using dialog() and open it using dialog('open')
[07:22:48] <udp> geoid: remember you need the jquery UI CSS for them to function
[07:23:05] <ssj1> Uncaught Syntax error, unrecognized expression: '(')
[07:23:13] <geoid> I saw those examples but I can't get any of them to work locally. I just don't understand the basic mechanic of how it's supposed to work.
[07:23:15] <ssj1> umm can anyone tell me why am i getting that?
[07:23:33] <ssj1> i m using the contains selector
[07:23:53] <ssj1> to look for specific words or characters
[07:24:05] <ssj1> but when i try to look for ( or ) i get that terror
[07:24:09] <ssj1> that error*
[07:24:56] <mlechner> geoid: and you need the jquery-ui.js as well! pastebin what you are trying
[07:25:45] <DynamicFail> NoiseEee, The placement of my jquery is the problem with my code? or just for jsfiddle
[07:27:49] <ssj1> umm anyone?
[07:28:12] <ml-data> Hello. Im doing a .prepend() with two LI's to a UL-element. The second time i do the prepend() the LI's doesnt come first, theyre not prepended. Is that because ive modified the UL already and i have to update its index somehow?
[07:28:31] <PeterB> Can anyone tell me how to time two different JS calls - either in FF or Chrome please? Trying to work out which jQuery syntax is faster
[07:28:35] <geoid> mlechner http://jsfiddle.net/RYH4c/
[07:28:44] <Eviltwin> PeterB: jsperf.com :P
[07:29:05] <NoiseEee> DynamicFail: your code and the fiddle, i assume.  you can't manipulate the DOM or tell an element to be draggable before it's rendered and ready.  see the link I pasted about onready
[07:29:20] <geoid> ssj1 you're not making much sense :) try pastie your code and let us have a look
[07:29:26] <PeterB> Eviltwin: lovely thanks :D
[07:29:27] <geoid> ssj1
[07:29:27] <Eviltwin> PeterB: What are the syntaxes?
[07:29:50] <ssj> geoid
[07:29:54] <LordThumper> geoid: You need to download some images together with jQuery UI
[07:30:03] <LordThumper> These will be used for background etc
[07:30:27] <PeterB> Eviltwin: $('#myid').find('a.v-iframe:first') vs $('#myid').find('a.v-iframe')[0]
[07:30:33] <geoid> LordThumper I've got jQuery UI downlaoded and installed.
[07:30:34] <Eviltwin> Second is faster
[07:30:57] <LordThumper> geoid: Make sure the image files references are correct
[07:31:00] <Eviltwin> The $('#myid').find('a.v-iframe:first') actually runs $('#myid').find('a.v-iframe').first() after doing some processing
[07:31:09] <Eviltwin> So it still generates the same collection
[07:31:12] <geoid> LordThumper how?
[07:31:19] <ssj> http://pastebin.com/NjMKKPCQ
[07:31:23] <Eviltwin> But then there's an extra function call and extra overhead of the filters
[07:31:27] <ssj> thats the jquery
[07:31:44] <LordThumper> Wait, is the Dialog being displayed like in the jsfiddle?
[07:31:47] <PeterB> Eviltwin: thanks, the only issue with [0] is I then need to trigger a click event on the link, which wont' work
[07:31:48] <geoid> so which line is causeing the problem? ssj
[07:31:50] <LordThumper> Without backgrounds?
[07:31:57] <Eviltwin> PeterB: Use .eq(0)
[07:32:04] <geoid> LordThumper without styling in JsFiddle
[07:32:06] <Eviltwin> And it'll be a jQuery object of the first element instead
[07:32:18] <geoid> LordThumper but yes, looks the same locally
[07:32:30] <ssj> getting error in jquery.js
[07:32:32] <ssj> o.O
[07:32:37] <DynamicFail> NoiseEee, I added the ready function and still nothing
[07:32:37] <DynamicFail> http://jsfiddle.net/ENfPM/1/
[07:32:42] <LordThumper> Yeah then make sure you extracted the image files in the correct folder
[07:32:52] <LordThumper> Should be a subfolder in the styles directory
[07:33:00] <geoid> ssj then you need to add some console.logs in and narrow it down I think
[07:33:33] <Eviltwin> ssj: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide47
[07:33:44] <LordThumper> Mine is a folder called "images", think that's the default
[07:33:49] <PeterB> Perfect, thanks Eviltwin for your help!
[07:33:54] <LordThumper> Contains 15 images used for jQueryUI
[07:34:14] <ssj> http://pastebin.com/N992RSbr
[07:34:16] <geoid> LordThumper are images referenced relative to the location of the css file?
[07:34:20] <ssj> thats the errors
[07:34:45] <LordThumper> They are
[07:34:49] <geoid> ssj the only way to
[07:34:52] <AdvoWork> If i have: <legend id="added_products_text" >Added Products:</legend>  Any reason why  $("added_products_text legend").hide(); wouldnt hide it?
[07:34:58] <Eviltwin> ssj: Looks like you're using an invalid selector
[07:35:11] <Eviltwin> Probably around line 91 of MoveOR.js
[07:35:15] <ssj> umm
[07:35:18] <ssj> if u use
[07:35:23] <Eviltwin> Or something that's fed into it
[07:35:23] <NoiseEee> DynamicFail: at some point, you're going to have to look at your console and see what the errors are.  it makes fixing things easier.
[07:35:29] <ssj> words like Tree or anything else
[07:35:31] <ssj> it works
[07:35:39] <ssj> gives error with ( or )
[07:35:45] <LordThumper> BTW, make sure you use jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.css and the images from the same package
[07:35:46] <mlechner> geooid: $( "#dialog" ).dialog({ autoOpen: true, modal: true });
[07:35:50] <Eviltwin> ssj: Go to the first slide of that show and it explains how to debug
[07:35:50] <DynamicFail> I have firebug it doesn't say anything
[07:36:28] <ssj> using chrome to debug
[07:36:47] <LordThumper> Then reference jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.css, and you shouldn't have any trouble
[07:37:04] <mlechner> hi, I want items dropped into a list toi be removed if dragged out of the box the list is in. How to do this? It's an extension of the jquery-ui example about draggable and sortabel (http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/sortable.html). I want the items to be removed from the list of dragged somwhere far out (of a div).
[07:37:52] <Eviltwin> ssj: Set it to break on uncaught exceptions
[07:37:59] <Eviltwin> And then refresh
[07:38:00] <geoid> LordThumper I don't like to include all that css when I don't need it :(
[07:38:08] <geoid> makes the page slow
[07:38:13] <Eviltwin> When it hits the exception, it'll pause and show you all of the scopes
[07:38:27] <Eviltwin> Figure out what selector you're using that's bad
[07:40:06] <xckpd7> question: templating is supposed to separate code from markup. but what if I need to bold one of the words in a string?
[07:40:24] <geoid> LordThumper but your suggestion works.
[07:40:33] <geoid> thx
[07:41:18] <NoiseEee> DynamicFail: there were so many things wrong with the code, its kind of unbelievable / seems like you don't know what you're doing.  try to learn from http://jsfiddle.net/ENfPM/2/ and good luck
[07:41:33] <LordThumper> geoid: You need that css file for jQuery UI
[07:42:00] <ssj> $("table[class='maintable'] td:contains('(')").each(function(){  if use that
[07:42:03] <ssj> it gives error
[07:42:20] <ssj> $("table[class='maintable'] td:contains('Holly')").each(function(){
[07:42:24] <ssj> but works with that
[07:42:34] <LordThumper> If you want jQuery UI Dialog only you can deselect all other features from the website and download a package with only the features you want
[07:43:07] <ml-data> Interesting, have a look at the dom in firebug when prepending elements to a ul-element, http://jsfiddle.net/k6gDr/2/
[07:43:11] <LordThumper> Personally I use Fancy Box for modal popups
[07:43:42] <Shwaiil> Q: whats best to use .on() or .delegate() ? Thanks for looking!
[07:44:10] <Shwaiil> since last year I knew .live and .bind was substituted by .delegate (recomended instead)
[07:44:31] <Shwaiil> I've got a team mate here that says .on is better, but I didnt find any docs for .on()
[07:45:27] <Matiasu> j #css
[07:45:30] <Matiasu> whoops
[07:45:31] <mlechner> hi, how to change the jquery-ui example about draggable and sortable (http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/sortable.html) to make the items dragged into the list to be removable from the list if dragged somewhere far out (of a div)?
[07:45:47] <ml-data> Shwaiil: on() is supposed to replace bind() and delegate()
[07:46:11] <Shwaiil> ml-data: tks for looking, wheres docs for .on ?
[07:46:30] <ml-data> Shwaiil: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:46:36] <Shwaiil> tks
[07:46:36] <DynamicFail> NoiseEee, I guess I don't get based on what you said/posted why this works: http://jsfiddle.net/ENfPM/3/
[07:46:41] <ml-data> Shwaiil: np
[07:46:59] <Eviltwin> ssj: .delegate, .bind, and .live all call .on
[07:47:01] <NoiseEee> DynamicFail: for one, errors always (and did) show up in the console.
[07:47:01] <Eviltwin> Err
[07:47:07] <Eviltwin> Shwaiil: .delegate, .bind, and .live all call .on
[07:47:21] <NoiseEee> DynamicFail: you had syntax errors.
[07:47:22] <Eviltwin> Meaning .on is capable of doing all three and that it's one less function call if you use .on directly
[07:47:30] <NoiseEee> DynamicFail: syntax errors = no JS is going to run
[07:47:43] <DynamicFail> NoiseEee, What I just pasted actually works... I just did it a different way
[07:47:51] <DynamicFail> but I kept the jquery in the same location
[07:47:55] <geoid> LordThumper the dialogue seems to rely on the element already being present on the page. Is it possible to create the element with jQuery and then use dialogue on it? Can't seem to get that to work.
[07:47:56] <DynamicFail> I originally had it
[07:48:00] <Shwaiil> Eviltwin: hmm ok. I've allways used delegate because it was suposed to be the "thing" :P
[07:48:12] <ml-data> Shwaiil: on() is new in jquery 1.7
[07:48:30] <NoiseEee> DynamicFail: right, and thats fine now because you've wrapped it in the dom ready function, whereas before you didn't.  in general, best practice is to put all JS before </body> which is why I did what I did
[07:48:35] <ml-data> Shwaiil: thats why you've used delegate() :-)
[07:48:40] <Eviltwin> Shwaiil: Now if you do $(a).delegate(b,c,d) it calls $(a).on(c,b,d)
[07:48:48] <NoiseEee> DynamicFail: but your previous paste (v 1) had syntax errors. you need to use your console :)  good luck
[07:48:52] <Eviltwin> As of 1.7
[07:48:57] <Shwaiil> Eviltwin: ok
[07:48:59] <Shwaiil> tks
[07:49:10] <geoid> LordThumper got it working :) was trying to append it to document, which didn't work
[07:49:12] <Eviltwin> So there's no reason not to use .on unless you're writing for pre-1.7
[07:50:16] <Che-Anarc> I'm using: http://labs.juliendecaudin.com/barousel/ how can I pause / resume transitions?
[07:51:11] <mlechner> anybody? how to change the jquery-ui example about draggable and sortable (http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/sortable.html) to make the items dragged into the list to be removable from the list if dragged somewhere far out (of a div)?
[07:52:30] <geoid> anyone here used agility.js MVC?
[07:52:52] <Eviltwin> mlechner: I believe you can use the stop event
[07:53:04] <Eviltwin> And when it stops, check if it is outside the draggable/sortables
[07:53:08] <geoid> http://agilityjs.com
[07:53:10] <Eviltwin> And if so call .remove() on the element
[07:53:28] <LordThumper> mlechner: Can you create a duplicate on jsfiddle? Maybe someone can help
[07:54:31] <Shwaiil> Q: Let's say I have $(this), its a <a> element nested in <div><ul><li><a...><span...></li></div>. I usually see myself using .parent() and then children() to check for, let say <span>. what would be the best way to get an element in the same scope ? Thanks for looking
[07:55:15] <LordThumper> Shwaiil: siblings() ?
[07:55:28] <LordThumper> siblings("span")
[07:55:40] <Shwaiil> LordThumper: tks for looking. Is that using .next()
[07:55:42] <Shwaiil> etc ?
[07:55:49] <Shwaiil> I tryed it without success
[07:56:10] <Shwaiil> oh theres a method called sibilings tks
[07:56:11] <Shwaiil> i'll try that
[07:56:20] <Chib> o_O
[07:57:02] <Xotix> Does someone know a good javascript/prototype instruction? Not how to code but more like, javascript's protypal is like ...
[07:57:51] <Eviltwin> Xotix: Can you try rephrasing that and asking again?
[07:59:40] <sphinxxx> is there a way to reduce the small delay on page transitions in jquery mobile?  or is it just like that in the simulator
[08:00:14] <Xotix> Eviltwin:  i was looking for something like http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/
[08:01:20] <Eviltwin> Then use that
[08:01:26] <Eviltwin> Lots of great information in it
[08:01:37] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ Xotix
[08:01:38] <bot-t> Xotix, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[08:01:45] <Eviltwin> That first link also links to a lot of other good resources
[08:01:53] <Eviltwin> But JS Garden is my favorite for the advanced stuff
[08:02:25] <merlin1991> does someone know a tutorial for writing a plugin system where the client side code get's a stinglist of plugin names and according to that list loads scripts with getscript and calls some sort of initalization code on the script once loaded?
[08:02:55] <Tomas--> Let's say I have an array coming back that lists parameters that a user needs to enter to run a report, is it possible to loop through that array and create the necessary form elements to allow them to do so? For example, to run a report the month and year is needed so select boxes are dynamically created for month and year. Is this feasible?
[08:04:53] <Che-Anarc> I'm using http://labs.juliendecaudin.com/barousel/#ba_demos  a jQuery based transition effect... any1 know how to resume / pause on this?
[08:07:06] <Shwaiil> Q: Assuming I have a fnA(), I would like to run fnB() just after fnA() finishes. I remember something about queues or something (no clear memory). Can someone point me to the right info to get this working that way ? Thank you ;D
[08:07:17] <Xotix> thanks
[08:08:06] <Eviltwin> Shwaiil: In what context()?
[08:08:34] <Eviltwin> Are these synchronous functions
[08:08:56] <Shwaiil> Eviltwin: tks for looking! It's sync yeah :) But nice point, I remember how to use the async one
[08:09:09] <Shwaiil> but not the synchronous functions
[08:09:13] <Shwaiil> way of doing that
[08:09:14] <Eviltwin> fnA(); fnB() ?
[08:09:21] <Shwaiil> function_a()
[08:09:22] <Shwaiil> function_b()
[08:09:34] <jscheel> Shwaiil: http://api.jquery.com/deferred.promise/
[08:09:40] <jscheel> Shwaiil: or async.js
[08:09:59] <jscheel> https://github.com/caolan/async
[08:10:04] <pifantastic> Shwaiil: if fnA is synchronous, then you don't have to do anything special
[08:10:16] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/7acrU/
[08:10:18] <pifantastic> fnA(); fnB();
[08:10:27] <Shwaiil> pifantastic: ah ok
[08:10:37] <Shwaiil> I was confused then
[08:12:15] <Eviltwin> Most of the learning JavaScript resources I've seen assume a knowledge of some other programming languages
[08:12:32] <Eviltwin> JavaScript's not an ideal first language
[08:13:52] <geoid> Eviltwin try MVC in javascript... my head is spinning :S
[08:14:05] <gkatsev> eloquentjavascript.net is pretty good and doesn't assume prior knowledge
[08:16:43] <JamesTaylor> Hi all, is it possible to use a accordion in jqueryui in seperate table rows? the fiddle shows the working example from the website and the top part is my failed attempt at a solution between table rows: http://jsfiddle.net/NVadV/
[08:18:30] <DynamicFail> Is there a way to clone something but change the id?
[08:18:32] <Eviltwin> JamesTaylor: http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[08:18:37] <Eviltwin> Options "header"
[08:18:46] <dkoare> hi I have a problem with iteration in JSON
[08:18:51] <dkoare> someone can help me?
[08:19:18] <mlechner> Eviltwin: this took a while (sorry). My question was: how to change the jquery-ui example about draggable and sortable (http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/sortable.html) to make the items dragged into the list to be removable from the list if dragged somewhere far out (of a div)? have a look at http://jsfiddle.net/bJGgH/8/
[08:20:06] <DynamicFail> mlechner, have a function to handle if dropped in your delete area
[08:20:15] <ssj> Eviltwin fixed :D
[08:20:25] <ssj> switched to indexOf instead of contains
[08:22:24] <mlechner> DynamicFail: example?
[08:24:10] <DynamicFail> My helper is set to clone my div which has what I want it to do when I drag an object, but when i drop it, the clone and original are moved... how do I just drop the clone http://jsfiddle.net/m2YeQ/
[08:24:10] <JamesTaylor> thanks Eviltwin <3
[08:24:24] <DynamicFail> mlechner, get it in jsfiddle
[08:24:33] <geoid> any recommendations for handling forms with jQuery? Validation, ajax submission etc.
[08:24:47] <DynamicFail> also not that it is exactly your answer, but my paste I just did has how to call a function when you drop something
[08:25:01] <Eviltwin> see ?.serialize and see ?.serializeArray
[08:25:01] <bot-t> .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[08:25:01] <bot-t> .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[08:25:02] <YammYgirlcoding> guys, it's stupid, but I don't know how to reproduce this example from http://fancybox.net/, from the link "manual call". It looks black box to me!!
[08:25:41] <YammYgirlcoding> how they associated the manual2 to the images?
[08:25:42] <dkoare> hey, can you please help me understand how to iterate the attached JSON? I want to show per line - name, points - http://pastie.org/3131998
[08:26:42] <Korvin> Hey, I
[08:26:42] <Eviltwin> Is that what the JSON response looks like?
[08:26:53] <dkoare> yes
[08:27:13] <Eviltwin> Why is it serialized JSON within an array?
[08:27:29] <dkoare> I'm not sure what is the right way
[08:27:35] <Guest64291> Hey, I'm doing something that requires me to cache objects with some variables, right now I am simply pushing the object onto an array that contains different variables, however, I can't actually manipulate the object in the future
[08:27:47] <dkoare> but I do array.toJSON()
[08:28:04] <dkoare> and in order to combaine all together I do json_encode
[08:28:12] <dkoare> maybe there is another way
[08:28:16] <dkoare> you can tell me :)
[08:28:30] <YammYgirlcoding> so. can anyone show me how do I reproduce the manual call example from http://fancybox.net ?
[08:28:45] <Eviltwin> dkoare: You want it to look like this: http://pastie.org/3132014
[08:29:24] <dkoare> yes
[08:29:55] <ssj> how can i make characters like ] safe for posting ?
[08:29:55] <ssj> like ] convert it into %5D
[08:30:07] <Eviltwin> encodeURIComponent
[08:30:07] <`Korvin> Is there a good way to cache and access different dom elements?
[08:30:16] <dkoare> I'm new at Zend framework therefore I'm not sure how to coding it
[08:30:58] <ssj> ty Eviltwin :)
[08:31:49] <dkoare> I have some records.toJSON() and at the end I need to encode all together (json)
[08:33:28] <j`ey> how can I find if an elemnt is visiible?
[08:34:07] <dkoare> so can you help me here? :)
[08:34:45] <Eviltwin> I didn't see a statement of a problem
[08:34:56] <dkoare> there are 2 issues
[08:35:03] <dkoare> 1. the /" signs
[08:35:16] <Eviltwin> I don't know that that means
[08:35:24] <dkoare> 2. the ouptput is undefined
[08:35:37] <Eviltwin> Can you reproduce this issue at jsFiddle.net?
[08:35:55] <dkoare> you don't see any problem with my pastie?
[08:36:36] <Eviltwin> I told you you should change the way the JSON comes back from the server if you can
[08:36:36] <dkoare> how can I add there the JSON?
[08:36:55] <strtotime> is there a way to make jquery mobile apply theming to html appended to the DOM?
[08:37:35] <Eviltwin> dkoare: Can you change the JSON response?
[08:38:04] <dkoare> I'm not sure how, do you know php?
[08:38:15] <Eviltwin> The people in #php do
[08:38:38] <dkoare> it's for invite only
[08:38:48] <NoiseEee> ##php dkoare
[08:39:08] <dkoare> Cannot join channel (+r) - you need to be identified with services
[08:39:16] <NoiseEee> dkoare: register with nickserv
[08:39:16] <dkoare> I must register my name. right?
[08:40:54] <BinaryMaster> I am working on writing a widget when I set the default options var is $(this) in the scope and can I use it to pull data out of the element's tag?
[08:41:41] <Eviltwin> Have you read through this? http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[08:43:05] <BinaryMaster> honestly ... NO just going on my 15 years experience writing in other langs
[08:43:07] <BinaryMaster> :)
[08:43:09] <jamiemill> #jquery-ui is a bit sleepy so asking here:
[08:43:11] <jamiemill> Hi. I have a droppable <li> element that will not respond to draggable items at all, unless I set the draggable to use helper:clone. Any idea what could cause that?
[08:43:14] <BinaryMaster> guess I will go read
[08:44:04] <Eviltwin> BinaryMaster: I'm not sure how 15 years of experience in other languages is going to help you understand how to write a jQuery widget
[08:48:28] <ndee> is there an event when an element gets hidden?
[08:48:35] <Eviltwin> No
[08:49:13] <geoid> jQuery dialog... any way to change the classes on the buttons?
[08:52:06] <Eviltwin> geoid: Have you read through the options here? http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[08:53:06] <geoid> Eviltwin yes, couldn't find anything in there
[08:53:42] <Nicklas_> Can anyone tell me why when i click my tab ajaxstart works but if i go directly to that page ajaxstart doesnt work at all
[08:53:42] <Nicklas_> http://goo.gl/3x6fQ
[08:53:56] <Nicklas_> the spinner uses ajaxstart to work, but if you go directly to it it doesnt get ran
[08:56:53] <geoid> Eviltwin seems there's an undocumented option for passing a class to buttons if they are specified in array form
[09:02:57] <BreadMaker> hello everyone
[09:03:18] <Ungy> Hello I have a jQuery Dialog box showing up on Hover however in IE this cause the page to jump it makes the body longer before displaying does anyone have any good ideas of how I can force IE not to jump
[09:03:50] <BreadMaker> must be the z-index bug in IE
[09:04:45] <Ungy> possibly but Ihave seen it before on some dynamic forms I have made I used a overflow hidden to fix it before but in this case I cannot do that
[09:05:38] <Ungy> it is positioned relative so it should be pulled out of the standard box model but for some reason it is not
[09:06:43] <BreadMaker> mmm
[09:07:20] <BreadMaker> Ungy, can you show us the code in jsfiddle?
[09:08:42] <LekeFly> jQuery("a[rel=twipsy]").twipsy({ live: true  .. how do i seperate the parameters? :p
[09:10:59] <orentanay> I realize that .live is depricated, but I'm stuck w/ it for now. How do I kill a .live after it has been declared? thanks.
[09:11:14] <imc> quit
[09:11:28] <bot-t> orentanay, .die(): Remove all event handlers previously attached using .live() from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/die/
[09:11:37] <orentanay> nice, thanks.
[09:19:17] <jamiemill> I have a droppable <li> element that will not respond to draggable items at all, unless I set the draggable to use helper:clone. Any idea what could cause that?
[09:20:37] <ari5av> jamiemill: jsfiddle.net  see if you can reproduce the error
[09:21:25] <Ungy> BreadMaker woudl be kind of hard as it woudl require a very large amount of page code to show the error
[09:21:53] <jamiemill> ari5av: Thanks, but not sure I can reproduce easily outside this app. I think it's something to do with my particular markup or css, because I tried a draggable/droppable in the footer and it works as expected. Something about this particular element.
[09:22:40] <Ungy> jamiemill is the element created dynamically?
[09:22:51] <jamiemill> Ungy Yes
[09:23:04] <NoiseEee> jamiemill: have you played with the appendTo option?  maybe you need to append it somewhere other than <body>. console log ui.event and ui.helper (or for that matter 'ui' and 'event') and investimigate
[09:23:13] <Ungy> jamiemill by javascript?
[09:23:24] <jamiemill> Ungy Yes, via backbone.js. It has the 'ui-droppable' class so I know it's been initialised.
[09:23:55] <NoiseEee> jamiemill: also you can choose what makes it droppable via the 'tolerance' attribute
[09:23:57] <Ungy> hmm not sure then any specific positioning on that element
[09:24:09] <NoiseEee> jamiemill: hopefully i've given you enough to investimigate further
[09:24:31] <Ungy> crap this bug is making me angry
[09:24:43] <Ungy> I hate IE bugs
[09:25:12] <jamiemill> NoiseEee yes thanks will try fiddling with appendTo
[09:28:44] <Ungy> shit I think i have to get the height of the body set the css for body hieght and then supply overflow hidden to get rid of this bug then remove the hieght and make overflow visible again
[09:28:56] <Ungy> pardon my language but that is not cool
[09:29:21] <devc> Does anyone have solid SoundManager2 experience? I'm having a problem when loading the .js and .swf files that I can't figure out. Half the time the .swf is returning a 404 because the soundManager.url = './js/'; isn't being set before the js file creates the hidden flash div
[09:36:26] <sakasaliba> what should I fix in order to print the JSON name key?

[09:37:12] <hsbot> gf3: fix all the bugs
[09:37:36] <sakasaliba> it's getting the JSON lines, but how I choose a specific key?
[09:38:23] <Ungy> sakasaliba what kind fo key do you mean property?
[09:38:33] <sakasaliba> yes
[09:38:35] <Ungy> and have you already parsed the output?
[09:39:08] <StephenS> This is a debug mode, you got a problem with your form, it will try to help you, refresh when you think you nailed down the problem
[09:39:28] <Ungy> say you called it data after you parsed it data.propertyname or data["property"]
[09:39:30] <sakasaliba> you see the each()? there is an alert: it's printing me the json line - {"id":"22",.....}
[09:39:45] <StephenS> http://pastebin.com/bky4NVjE
[09:40:03] <StephenS> http://pastebin.com/KNrSAJCy
[09:40:26] <sakasaliba> Ungy - I've tried your way, the output is "undefinded" for some reason
[09:41:04] <sakasaliba>  Ungy - see here - http://pastie.org/3131998
[09:41:41] <sakasaliba> if I alert(val) only - this is json  {"id":"39",....}
[09:41:44] <Ungy> sakasaliba result = jQuery.parseJSON(result) that is important
[09:42:20] <Ungy> now your result is an array
[09:43:01] <sakasaliba> you are great!
[09:43:05] <Ungy> result[0].val
[09:43:20] <Ungy> result[i].val if yoru going through the array up to you
[09:43:36] <Ungy> anyways back to my crappy problem
[09:44:14] <sakasaliba> I'm trying now to do it as array
[09:44:22] <sakasaliba> (in order to study)
[09:44:32] <Ungy> it is an array that is what [] means
[09:45:10] <Ungy> [] = array {} = object in JSON
[09:45:47] <sakasaliba> where did you see []?
[09:46:12] <Ungy> , = delimeter for array and properties in JSON : =delimeter between property and it's value
[09:46:44] <sakasaliba> yes but in my pastie it's : and not =
[09:46:50] <StephenS> can someone help me please
[09:46:53] <StephenS> http://pastebin.com/KNrSAJCy
[09:46:56] <Ungy> sakasaliba yoru response is surrounded by []
[09:46:59] <StephenS> I get that error all the time, why?
[09:47:15] <sakasaliba> oh, got it
[09:47:30] <sakasaliba> if it would JSON it was {} ?
[09:48:15] <Ungy> sakasaliba please read what i said before
[09:48:36] <sakasaliba> if I get object {...} so it's JSON?
[09:48:42] <siovene> Hello.
[09:48:49] <sakasaliba> I'm not sure how it like as
[09:48:54] <Ungy> {} denotes object,  [] denotes array
[09:48:59] <sakasaliba> ok
[09:49:01] <madis> How to properly insert these notification scripts http://demos.9lessons.info/jnotification/index.php into my script http://pastebin.com/VBGkhpaf (instead of $('.success...........)
[09:49:06] <sakasaliba> thx
[09:49:08] <Ungy> Json can return any valid json both cases are acceptable
[09:49:19] <siovene> Occasionally, Chrome tells my that my GET ajax request is "canceled" (Network tab of developer tools). Does anybody have any idea why that could be?
[09:49:24] <Ungy> StephenS not enough information man
[09:49:31] <StephenS> what do you else need?
[09:49:38] <StephenS> whole validation script?
[09:49:51] <StephenS> or html code
[09:49:54] <Ungy> what is the error when is it called how is it called
[09:50:02] <StephenS> maybe something doesnt fit in there
[09:50:05] <StephenS> uhm
[09:50:07] <StephenS> like this:
[09:50:12] <madis> Oh, mustve overlooked Step.3
[09:50:16] <StephenS> This is a debug mode, you got a problem with your form, it will try to help you, refresh when you think you nailed down the problem
[09:50:24] <StephenS> thats just a message but I can change it
[09:50:48] <geoid> On this demo: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#modal-form
[09:50:48] <geoid> The modal form makes use of validation like checkLength() and checkRegexp()
[09:50:49] <geoid> Where do these methods come from?
[09:51:07] <Ungy> StephenS yeah I get that part but exactly how, where and when it is called matters
[09:51:48] <Ungy> geoid if you read teh code it says it comes from jQuery Validation extension
[09:52:12] <StephenS> when I submit a purchase
[09:52:14] <Ungy> I really dislike that one by the way it is not done very well
[09:52:22] <StephenS> all fields pass'd and I stil got that debug message
[09:52:42] <geoid> Ungy tx.. I'm reading the code, but I don't see that?
[09:52:55] <Ungy> ok Stephen now you submit what does that do submit the form and page reloads because of error or are you catching it in javascript before submission
[09:52:59] <geoid> aah.. spotted it
[09:53:18] <StephenS> catching it before js submission i think
[09:53:25] <StephenS> cause there is no error all fields are submitted good
[09:53:30] <Ungy> you think you mean you do not know?
[09:53:30] <StephenS> validated* I meant
[09:54:13] <StephenS> i know
[09:54:42] <Ungy> StephenS so tell me what is teh exact error you recieve
[09:54:52] <StephenS> This is a debug mode, you got a problem with your form, it will try to help you, refresh when you think you nailed down the problem
[09:55:10] <Ungy> that is yoru code is it not?
[09:56:19] <StephenS> its my error msg yes
[09:56:23] <Ungy> StephenS presumably you would want to check for existance of error before calling this
[09:56:33] <StephenS> yet there is no error
[09:56:46] <StephenS> so II dont know why it keeps saying that debug errror
[09:56:56] <Ungy> so what is the code that calls this debug(error)
[09:57:18] <whoever> hi all i am trying onChange of a combo box alert($(this.val)); . but all i seem to get in my alert is[object]  can someone assist
[09:57:54] <Ungy> stephenS well obviously your calling it when you shouldn't be or you need to add handling to take into account error coudl be null or have no length
[09:58:26] <StephenS> is there a way to debug this?
[09:58:30] <Ungy> whoever don't you mean val()
[09:58:35] <StephenS> which is ironic cause Im debugging a debug :D
[09:59:10] <Ungy> StephenS try this add if(error.length > 0 ) {} around teh whole function
[09:59:34] <Ungy> what I mean by that is inside the debug function itself
[09:59:51] <StephenS> http://pastebin.com/ALfv6iM2
[09:59:52] <Ungy> nothing shoudl happen if error.length is 0 correct?
[09:59:52] <StephenS> like that?
[10:00:10] <StephenS> well ya it should be bigger then 0 yes
[10:00:28] <StephenS> lol
[10:00:33] <StephenS> I literally meants add xD
[10:00:34] <StephenS> sec
[10:00:39] <Ungy> no better yet add the following lines at the begging of the function
[10:00:50] <StephenS> what do you mean by "if"
[10:00:51] <StephenS> sec
[10:00:57] <Ungy> if(!error) return;
[10:00:59] <fission6> any backbone.js supporters in here
[10:01:10] <Ungy> if(error.length == 0) return;
[10:01:18] <Ungy> then try it again
[10:01:36] <StephenS> http://pastebin.com/fh0HN0q1.
[10:01:39] <StephenS> http://pastebin.com/fh0HN0q1 Good?
[10:01:42] <Ungy> fission6 I have no idea what that is
[10:01:48] <whoever> Ungy: i tried .val() but the alert doesn't happen so i tried .val  and thats when i get [objeCt ]
[10:02:00] <sente> pastebin.com is like godaddy
[10:02:10] <sente> it's the most popular of the all the pastebins, and the shittiest
[10:02:12] <sente> makes sense
[10:03:09] <Jayflux> Anyone here on ie9 fancy checking a possible bug for me?
[10:03:16] <Jayflux> found a weird problem
[10:03:19] <Ungy> StephenS http://pastebin.com/4adeRcVn
[10:03:22] <whoever> Ungy: alert($(this.va()l));
[10:03:33] <Ungy> Jayflux which is?
[10:03:42] <whoever> Ungy:  should be alert($(this.va()l));
[10:03:59] <whoever> * move the l over befor the parens
[10:04:14] <Jayflux> Ungy ajaxstart crashes the browser after another ajaxstart runs, even when both are namespaced differently. Its only happening in ie9
[10:04:42] <Ungy> whoever alert($(this).val());
[10:05:10] <Ungy> JayFlux that is wierd
[10:05:23] <StephenS> Ungy nope
[10:05:27] <StephenS> still get the debug error
[10:05:40] <StephenS> should I just disable a error mode and just process it with inputs and all?
[10:05:52] <StephenS> I mean if it really doesnt give me a real error why would I use it anyway/
[10:06:05] <geoid> does jQuery.ui not include validate? Is it a separate plugin that I need to download?
[10:06:31] <fission6> any backbone.js supporters in here
[10:06:32] <Ungy> stephenSadd alert(error.length);
[10:07:04] <Ungy> geoid yes I don't like it very much but yeah you need to get it seperatly
[10:07:10] <velts> does anyone know how I jsonp works exactly?
[10:07:28] <hsparikh> hey folks - need some advice on jquery.Callbacks()
[10:07:33] <geoid> mootools has an awsome form validator - miss that :(
[10:07:36] <Ungy> velts do you know how fusion works exactly
[10:08:05] <Ungy> geoid there are lots of validators around google is yoru friend
[10:08:21] <geoid> Ungy is there one you would recommend?
[10:08:23] <Ungy> mines not done or I woudl give you it
[10:08:35] <velts> Ungy: yes I actually do
[10:08:36] <velts> http://bit.ly/xs7nRQ
[10:09:16] <Ungy> velts grand that is lots of information how about you limit yoru question a bit
[10:09:44] <velts> i am just wondering how with jsonp, crossdomain calls work
[10:10:18] <velts> do the server and client pass something back and forth?
[10:10:19] <whoever> Ungy: strange it doesn't work, but to make sure I am in the function i can alert("in function");
[10:11:05] <Ungy> velts http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-aj-jsonp1/
[10:11:23] <whoever> Ungy: for what it is worth  i have function(){alert("test");}
[10:11:55] <Ungy> whoever I don't know then I think you might want to just call a function and then get the val() there
[10:12:11] <whoever> Ungy: ok
[10:12:18] <whoever> Ungy: thx for tring
[10:13:08] <Ungy> whoerver well I get the val when calling a function no problem so I dunno maybe ont eh select box you are actually getting the property of the select rather then the option selected
[10:13:42] <geoid> so how do I get this validation thingy working? I've included the js lib via cdn, and included the form and code from the demo, but it don't work. Says checkLength() method doesn't exist
[10:13:46] <fission6> anyone here use backbone.js?
[10:14:01] <ajpiano> fission6: what's up.
[10:14:25] <geoid> doh.. it's there in the code.
[10:14:47] <fission6> ajpiano: curious to talk with someone who uses backbone.js or the like - do you use backbone actively
[10:14:49] <geoid> fission6 I've looked at it... not used it. Sounds gr8.
[10:14:58] <ajpiano> fission6: very much so
[10:15:36] <ajpiano> i've done almost every proj for the last like 9 months in backbone
[10:15:38] <Ungy> geoid do you see that validation.js being downloaded
[10:16:03] <fission6> do you find it leading to better structure for code maintence and ability to produce high quality single page apps?
[10:16:05] <fission6> ajpiano: ^
[10:16:11] <ajpiano> fission6: compared to what?
[10:16:18] <ajpiano> a big ol' mess of jqueries?
[10:16:21] <fission6> no using it i guess
[10:16:25] <fission6> not
[10:16:37] <ajpiano> yes, i do
[10:16:38] <fission6> have you considered any alternatives
[10:17:04] <ajpiano> um, i never really honestly considered spine.js cause it's basically the same thing
[10:17:12] <ajpiano> and i want to give ember.js a shot, but haven't yet
[10:17:36] <ajpiano> the appeal of ember over backbone, in theory, is the data-binding is a lot more automagic
[10:17:48] <fission6> ajpiano: are you using a template lib at all?
[10:17:51] <ajpiano> yes ofc
[10:17:54] <ajpiano> i prefer handlebars
[10:18:02] <href> handlebars <3
[10:18:04] <fission6> thats what i am using, handlebars
[10:18:15] <ajpiano> backbone/underscore gets underscore templates for free, but handlebars is really nice
[10:18:24] <ajpiano> fission6: a crucial part of also staying organised is not really backbone itself, per se
[10:18:25] <fission6> i was thinking handlebars, backbone, and jquery would be a nice stack on the client end
[10:18:40] <ajpiano> but using requirejs or another amd loader to write relatively small modules
[10:18:46] <ajpiano> with well defined dependencies, etc.
[10:18:55] <fission6> interesting
[10:18:55] <ajpiano> and limited surfaces
[10:19:09] <fission6> im also considering batman.js
[10:19:12] <fission6> which looks promising
[10:19:33] <ajpiano> there's also knockout.js too
[10:19:35] <ajpiano> i haven't tried either
[10:20:03] <Ungy> aren't most of those focused on different thing?
[10:20:38] <ajpiano> backbone/spine/knockout/ember/batman ?
[10:20:45] <ajpiano> i would say they are generally focused on the same task
[10:21:26] <geoid> what about agility.js
[10:21:27] <geoid> ?
[10:21:54] <ajpiano> the list goes on and on, i looked at agility the other day and found it relatively undesirable
[10:22:40] <geoid> ajpiano I looked at it and couldn't understand a thing. MVC makes sense to me in PHP, but I just can't wrap my head around it in JS.
[10:22:44] <fission6> backbone seems like well proven choice
[10:22:51] <fission6> i think i may run with it and handlebars
[10:23:19] <ajpiano> geoid: you have to give yourself a decent testbed project and a couple of weeks
[10:23:21] <ajpiano> to really let it sink in
[10:23:51] <ajpiano> geoid: the differnce is that most people with JS are used to like, modifying markup that's already there or clumsily creating more markup
[10:24:18] <ajpiano> but with the mvc paradigm in client side, you think more about the actual components and their relationships, and the html part is just how those concepts happen to be represent
[10:24:26] <fission6> ajpiano: thanks for the insight - i think ill run with backbone and handlebars, should keep the app cool for a yr
[10:24:33] <ajpiano> heh
[10:24:34] <geoid> so where does the HTML get produced?
[10:24:47] <geoid> I've got a perfect test bed, but I can't find the seam between where PHP serving HTML or JSON ends and where the JS MVC would start.
[10:24:47] <ajpiano> fission6: i'm writing a scrabble client in backbone right now, so i hope so :)
[10:25:08] <fission6> ajpiano: any public sites with backbone youve worked on
[10:25:16] <ajpiano> geoid: when you say "make me a new Thing", the thing itself has a view, which has a template
[10:25:43] <geoid> but is that template HTML? or javascript with .append('<div>')?
[10:25:46] <fission6> geoid: think RESTful webservices with the whole "app" digesting the services in js on the client side
[10:26:02] <ajpiano> the view and template work together to actually produce the html from the data in the Thing
[10:26:31] <fission6> ajpiano: anything public i can look at
[10:26:43] <geoid> ajpiano why was agility undesirable?
[10:26:46] <udp> geoid: I've gone to the extreme with my current project - the server serves JSON, Javascript and templates compiled into JS functions, and then *everything* is generated clientside
[10:26:50] <ajpiano> fission6: this gmail extension, i did most of the initial engineering for - but handed the code off a long time ago http://www.cirrusinsight.com/
[10:27:05] <ajpiano> fission6: this is the side proj i'm working on now: https://github.com/bocoup/Cor-
[10:27:32] <geoid> udp I don't even know what that means :)
[10:27:45] <ajpiano> fission6: also if you haven't seen https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc
[10:27:55] <ajpiano> addy does the same "todo" app in like, every mvc framework
[10:28:14] <fission6> damn any reviews or conclusions across each implementation ajpiano
[10:28:26] <ajpiano> geoid: the $$ thing, just the entire way it works, it doesn't appeal to me at all
[10:29:13] <ajpiano> fission6: i don't know if there are any "reviews" per se
[10:29:17] <Ungy> you know this sounds interesting I always just straight maipulate the dom via javascript using objects for all my data maybe I shoudl look into one of those
[10:29:31] <ajpiano> but at least with that project, you can get a sense of what the same fundamental task looks like in a large variety of flavours, and see which you like
[10:30:09] <fission6> true ajpiano
[10:30:24] <geoid> ajpiano nice link... busy cloning it
[10:30:26] <fission6> i mean backbone seems to be proven so i may just run with it and handlebars
[10:31:08] <geoid> fission6 maybe you should find your backbone and write your own bicycle.js for your handlebars.
[10:31:26] <geoid> :D
[10:31:51] <fission6> funny guyyy
[10:32:06] <fission6> but handlebars is a joke on mustache
[10:32:25] <fission6> maybe ill write foomanchu
[10:33:35] <andrew9183> lol
[10:37:03] <geoid> Ungy can't get this (*&^%&^&*^^ validation to work :@
[10:37:11] <geoid> :x
[10:38:37] <Ungy> geoid well man I dunno Ihate the freaking thing and will not use it cause frankly it is pretty bad
[10:38:45] <geoid> phew.. figured it out  8)
[10:38:53] <geoid> venting must've helped
[10:39:19] <siovene> Anybody can help on why very randomly and very rarely, I get an ajax request "canceled"?
[10:40:30] <Eviltwin> 'Cause you .abort() it randoml?
[10:40:34] <Eviltwin> randomly*
[10:41:03] <siovene> Eviltwin: haha no of course not.
[10:41:17] <Eviltwin> Well that was my last idea
[10:41:37] <siovene> I'll just get "canceled" in Chrome's dev tool Network tab, and the request won't hit the server.
[10:42:09] <Eviltwin> That's what happens with canceled requests
[10:42:10] <siovene> And it's so rare, I've seen it only once, while trying a couple hundred times.
[10:42:53] <siovene> Eviltwin: do you know if my error callback should be called in that case?
[10:42:55] <geoid> siovene could be some sort of timing issue - maybe you are recycling an instance of your request object?
[10:43:05] <Eviltwin> siovene: It should, yes
[10:43:36] <YammYgirlcoding> guys i'm getting error from firefox: $.fancybox is not a function. But jquery is loaded and fancybox script is loaded too. I put alert on both and they show.
[10:43:40] <YammYgirlcoding> what could it be ?
[10:43:45] <siovene> geoid: no, I'm not (at least not deliberately)
[10:43:59] <siovene> Eviltwin: ok, then I'll handle it there even if I don't know why it's happening.
[10:44:07] <geoid> nighty night d00dz
[10:44:55] <Ungy> YammYgirlcoding does fancy box require a jquery object?
[10:45:08] <ShaunR> anybody recommend a good simple slider, looking for one that can do both html slides or just images
[10:45:19] <Ungy> $(body).fancybox()
[10:45:36] <YammYgirlcoding> i think it does because it uses $ in it
[10:45:51] <YammYgirlcoding> i put that jquery.fn to see if it's loaded, and jquery is loaded.
[10:47:21] <eggnogg> If I have a #container with {margin:0 auto;} such that it is centered on my page, and I want to animate it to shift to the left hand side with .animate({marginLeft:"5px"}),  my container doesn't slide as it normally should.  it just blinks to the left.  The reason is because of auto.  Does anyone know of a way around this?
[10:48:16] <Eviltwin> eggnogg: .animate (without additional plugins) only animates numeric properties
[10:48:22] <Eviltwin> "auto" is not a number
[10:49:22] <eggnogg> Any idea how I can make it work with auto?
[10:49:44] <eggnogg> I don't want to have to control positioning of my elements with javascript
[10:50:11] <Che-Anarc> I'm using barousel a jQuery based transition effect... any1 know how to resume / pause transitions on this... its stops when I click on a thumbnail.
[10:50:17] <Eviltwin> What you need to do is determine what the margin-left is effectively right before you animate and set it explicitly to that
[10:50:30] <Eviltwin> And then animate
[10:50:45] <DynamicFail> Eviltwin, Is there a way a duplicate a div in a way that when you reference it you can distinguish it from the original?
[10:50:47] <eggnogg> I'll try thanks
[10:51:00] <Eviltwin> DynamicFail: How are you doing it now?
[10:51:05] <eggnogg> DynamicFail: give it an id
[10:51:19] <eggnogg> or iterate children
[10:51:19] <DynamicFail> I use a helper function with clone
[10:51:21] <AdonisSMU> Hi everyone
[10:51:25] <DynamicFail> http://jsfiddle.net/m2YeQ/
[10:51:27] <AdonisSMU> How are you all?
[10:51:42] <Eviltwin> DynamicFail: There's a "JavaScript" box for a reason
[10:51:48] <DynamicFail> Which I know is wrong, but I can't figure out a way to do it correctly.
[10:51:50] <DynamicFail> :)
[10:52:18] <DynamicFail> You can see I want to be able to drag and drop the box in Video and it still remain there in the top box.
[10:52:33] <DynamicFail> I get two items while dragging but when I drop they both get moved
[10:53:07] <eggnogg> just use a class .box and find this
[10:53:09] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/m2YeQ/1/
[10:53:19] <Eviltwin> That's how you should have done the jsFiddle
[10:53:32] <BinaryMaster> to test if a element has a child of a class would this work if( $(this).has('.selector').length > 0)
[10:53:58] <Eviltwin> BinaryMaster: Child or descendant?
[10:54:05] <BinaryMaster> child
[10:54:16] <Eviltwin> $(this).children('.class').length > 0
[10:54:32] <Eviltwin> Or simply if($(this).children('.class').length)
[10:54:47] <BinaryMaster> okay cool Thank you
[10:55:00] <Che-Anarc> Eviltwin   any ideas on my pause / resume issue?  :-Þ
[10:55:07] <Eviltwin> Since 0 is effectively false and every positive number is effectively true
[10:55:18] <Eviltwin> Che-Anarc: It's a plugin issue meaning that it's not really a jQuery issue
[10:55:23] <Eviltwin> And I have no familiarity with the plugin
[10:55:26] <DynamicFail> Thanks Eviltwin I'm new to Jquery and Jsfilddle
[10:56:15] <DynamicFail> Was the class stuff a solution to my problem?
[10:56:32] <Eviltwin> eggnogg's suggestion?
[10:56:35] <Eviltwin> I think so
[10:58:59] <kismee> Hello guys
[10:59:37] <AdonisSMU> question for you guys
[11:00:06] <AdonisSMU> I am using jquery to access a json object
[11:00:44] <Che-Anarc> (function ($) { $.fn.barousel = function (callerSettings) {........ settings.stopCarousel = 0;  })(jQuery);     is there any way to get settings.stopCarousel ?
[11:00:49] <AdonisSMU> However, when I try to set my variable equal to the results of the quiz.json
[11:01:01] <AdonisSMU> file that I am getting with $.getJSON
[11:01:05] <AdonisSMU> I get nothing
[11:01:07] <AdonisSMU> it failes
[11:01:10] <AdonisSMU> fails
[11:01:17] <Eviltwin> AdonisSMU: Can you show us the relevant section of code?
[11:01:21] <AdonisSMU> sure
[11:01:27] <andrew9183> Eviltwin: do you use backbone ?
[11:01:32] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: Nope
[11:01:46] <eggnogg> var topicList = $('#topicList');
[11:01:46] <eggnogg> 	var a = topicList.css("marginLeft");
[11:01:46] <eggnogg> 	console.log(a);
[11:01:49] <eggnogg> outputs 0
[11:01:58] <kismee> I have a ~selection~ issue with jquery, in a set of input (checkboxes), I'd like to apply some effects only on those which are checked, preview of issue here : http://jsfiddle.net/jJvEr/1/
[11:02:02] <Eviltwin> eggnogg: Because it's auto
[11:02:07] <AdonisSMU> http://jsfiddle.net/Astericky/XHDSm/
[11:02:13] <Eviltwin> You are going to have to figure it out, jQuery won't do it for you
[11:02:29] <Eviltwin> AdonisSMU: It's an asyncronous function
[11:02:32] <vithos> fancybox2 question: the transition animations on this gallery aren't working properly on this page http://tradeskillmaster.wikispaces.com/ReleasePreview but they work if i run it on this standalone copy of the gallery http://failsport.com/tsm/tsm.html any idea?
[11:02:38] <eggnogg> I tried with elem.style.margin(Left) to no avail also
[11:02:48] <Eviltwin> AdonisSMU: Take a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/uYeYN/1/
[11:03:03] <Eviltwin> It illustrates the difference between how an syncronous function is used an an asyncrounous function is used
[11:03:21] <Eviltwin> The letters after the //// give you the order things actually run in
[11:03:25] <Eviltwin> Starting with A
[11:04:42] <Eviltwin> AdonisSMU: It's not possible to have a function that returns the result of an asyncronous AJAX call
[11:04:52] <Eviltwin> var data = getData(); isn't possible
[11:04:59] <Eviltwin> You need to rework to use a callback function
[11:05:08] <Eviltwin> Something like getData(function(data) { ... })
[11:06:44] <AdonisSMU> Ohhh ok
[11:06:51] <AdonisSMU> I almost understand it
[11:07:03] <DynamicFail> Eviltwin, Any good books on web design/jquery?
[11:07:16] <Eviltwin> DynamicFail: I usually tell people to see ?learn
[11:07:16] <bot-t> DynamicFail, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[11:07:19] <DynamicFail> I want php/css selectors/ajax/jquery
[11:07:21] <Eviltwin> Some of those resources are also offered in paper
[11:07:36] <StephenS> !+paste
[11:07:37] <StephenS> !paste
[11:07:38] <Eviltwin> Don't know any good PHP books, ask ##php
[11:07:55] <Misiur> Hello. I've got question: is there method to retrieve class attribute (like margin) without actually creating element with this class?
[11:08:19] <madis> im sure there is
[11:08:24] <Eviltwin> CSS selectors aren't terribly complicated but the detais of their relative performance and precidence in stylesheets can be
[11:08:35] <Eviltwin> And when/how to use what CSS properties in which browsers

[11:10:16] <madis> How to change that code to just fadeOut(120) ??? http://pastebin.ca/2099742 - its part of jquery_notification plugin I'm using...
[11:11:34] <madis> test test
[11:12:15] <Misiur> Anyone knows the answer? I don't like creating ghost element just to get one attribute from styles
[11:13:10] <madis> jquery_notification_v.1.js script does just that, Misiur
[11:13:17] <madis> maybe you get some ideas from there
[11:13:28] <AdonisSMU> When I do this... http://jsfiddle.net/Astericky/XHDSm/1/
[11:13:30] <NoiseEee> Misiur: you want to query the stylesheet?
[11:13:48] <AdonisSMU> it doesn't actually return the data.results
[11:14:02] <udp> AdonisSMU: You can't do that
[11:14:16] <udp> the callback function will execute after your getQuizData function has returned
[11:14:25] <udp> and you're returning from the callback function, not getQuizData
[11:14:40] <udp> it's asynchronous, treat it as such
[11:15:09] <AdonisSMU> I get what you are saying but I don't know what you mean treat it like its asynchronous
[11:15:22] <udp> well, you'll never be able to call getQuizData in the manner you want
[11:15:26] <kismee> NoiseEee, worked like a charm, cheers. :)
[11:15:30] <udp> you will have to pass a callback function to it instead
[11:15:56] <AdonisSMU> Ok let me update and see if this is what you are talking about
[11:16:00] <udp> and whatever has to deal with the quiz data will have to run in that callback function
[11:16:04] * chee rs
[11:16:27] <jmoney> i.imgur.com/agjXW.jpg
[11:16:32] <NoiseEee> np kismee
[11:16:42] <AdonisSMU> ahh ic gotcha
[11:16:49] <AdonisSMU> I think
[11:17:17] <AdonisSMU> I wanted to define a variable to do something like var quiz = getData();
[11:17:27] <udp> yeah, you can't
[11:17:32] <AdonisSMU> but I can't do that so I have to do a
[11:17:34] <Misiur> NoiseEee: I have element with 2 classes, and when one is deleted, the settings from first class apply. I need to know some dimensions from first class before deleting second
[11:17:41] <udp> because there's no such thing as a blocking function
[11:18:10] <AdonisSMU> $.getJSON('quiz.json', callbackfunction)
[11:18:50] <Misiur> http://james.padolsey.com/demos/animateToSelector/ this seems quite nice
[11:18:53] <AdonisSMU> and so I will have to do all my work inside the callback funtion
[11:18:58] <udp> AdonisSMU: yes
[11:19:26] <AdonisSMU> udp: so my anonymous function is really an object with methods and stuff inside of it
[11:19:28] <AdonisSMU> is that okay?
[11:19:32] <udp> is a what?
[11:19:38] <udp> *blinks*
[11:19:40] <AdonisSMU> my callback function
[11:19:43] <udp> your anonymous function is a closure
[11:20:00] <udp> it will have access to your variables anyway
[11:20:17] <NoiseEee> Misiur: as long as the class styles are defined in a stylesheet, http://www.hunlock.com/blogs/Totally_Pwn_CSS_with_Javascript should get you there
[11:20:32] <NoiseEee> Misiur: you can retrieve/set styles
[11:20:40] <Misiur> NoiseEee: Cool, thanks
[11:22:30] <AdonisSMU> upd: so if I do something like http://jsfiddle.net/Astericky/XHDSm/3/
[11:22:45] <AdonisSMU> that's correct?
[11:23:20] <AdonisSMU> udp: so if I do something like this http://jsfiddle.net/Astericky/XHDSm/3/ it's correct
[11:23:28] <udp> AdonisSMU: erh... no
[11:23:35] <udp> well actually
[11:23:36] <udp> yeah why not
[11:23:50] <udp> why are you using functions like that though?
[11:24:08] <kavelot> shouldn't next('div') return just the next div?
[11:24:38] <AdonisSMU> udp: I'm not 100% sure actually sure bit ot
[11:24:48] <AdonisSMU> but it's how I've always done it
[11:25:05] <udp> AdonisSMU: just do what you want to do directly in the callback function
[11:25:22] <NoiseEee> AdonisSMU: move everything that depends on the xhr response to the callback
[11:25:57] <AdonisSMU> I just need the data from the callback function
[11:26:03] <AdonisSMU> That's it
[11:26:13] <AdonisSMU> I just want to get it out of there honestly
[11:26:21] <udp> AdonisSMU: wrong approach
[11:26:36] <NoiseEee> AdonisSMU: give http://www.mattlunn.me.uk/blog/2011/11/handling-an-ajax-response-in-javascript-with-or-without-jquery/ a read, for example.  you need to understand function execution and callbacks.
[11:26:37] <udp> the data belongs to the callback function, use it there (and call other things with it if you want)
[11:27:27] <NoiseEee> AdonisSMU: in your example, "return quiz" is executed (most likely) before any XHR response has been received
[11:27:46] <AdonisSMU> That's correct
[11:27:51] <NoiseEee> not to mention the inherent scope problems in your example
[11:27:53] <AdonisSMU> that's exactly what's happening
[11:28:05] <NoiseEee> AdonisSMU: i know thats whats happening, thats how JS works
[11:28:34] <NoiseEee> AdonisSMU: move things that depend on the received data to the callback.  do some googling, you'll grok it soon.
[11:28:52] <AdonisSMU> but everything depends on it...
[11:29:00] <AdonisSMU> everything depends on the data
[11:29:04] <udp> AdonisSMU: the code that initiates the request has to execute immediately
[11:29:08] <NoiseEee> so move *everything* to the callback.
[11:29:09] <udp> it can't hang around waiting for the callback to executre
[11:29:35] <xrated> or make every request synchronous and be awesome
[11:29:46] * NoiseEee tases xrated
[11:30:13] <AdonisSMU> Ok thanks guys... I will play with this some more and get back to you all... thanks for your help...
[11:31:37] <jscheel> is there a way to make droppable accept a draggable from the cursor position, vs the center of the draggable element?
[11:32:28] <elux> hey guys.. i have a textfield under #search, if i do .. $("#search").focus(function() { alert('test'); }  .. i get an infinite loop of alert boxes
[11:32:43] <NoiseEee> jscheel: see the "tolerance" option of the droppable
[11:32:45] <elux> i really just wanted to know when the initial focus is in place..
[11:32:55] <kryl> hi, how can I use modal with event ? for example if I success a POST I want to open a modal with thank you content ?
[11:33:02] <jscheel> NoiseEee: doh, thanks!
[11:33:08] <NoiseEee> np
[11:34:59] <elux> nevermind.. strange
[11:38:12] <madis> please help - how to change these two functions into a simpler fadeOut / fadeIn ones - http://pastebin.ca/2099756
[11:51:41] <Eviltwin> madis: Did you see ?.animate
[11:51:41] <bot-t> madis, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[11:51:50] <Eviltwin> The "complete" callback?
[11:52:09] <Eviltwin> It's called when the animation finished
[11:52:29] <Eviltwin> Which I supsect you're trying to accomplish with this setTimeout for the remove at line 10
[11:53:21] <Eviltwin> As a result, you could rework it so the chain starts with an animation
[11:53:31] <Eviltwin> Which means you could use .delay() instead of the setTimeout wrapper
[11:53:53] <Eviltwin> I don't think the parseInt's are necessary
[11:54:14] <Eviltwin> If you're trying to round the number to an integer, the proper function for that is Math.floor()
[11:54:33] <Eviltwin> But I'm not sure that's necessary
[11:55:19] <z0n3d> what's the proper way to empty an array?
[11:55:28] <NoiseEee> z0n3d: redefine it
[11:55:48] <Eviltwin> z0n3d: array.length = 0
[11:56:25] <Eviltwin> NoiseEee: redefining works unless there's another reference to it
[11:56:53] <Eviltwin> But it also means that the old one becomes garbage and a new one is constructed
[11:57:03] <Eviltwin> So I think this way is fater
[11:57:09] <Eviltwin> And more memory-friendly
[11:57:30] <NoiseEee> i suppose this is likely true
[11:57:43] <z0n3d> thanks :)
[11:57:44] <NoiseEee> but does the old one become garbage?
[11:58:21] <Eviltwin> In my case the elements that aren't referenced elsewhere become garbage
[11:58:37] <Eviltwin> In your case the elements that aren't referenced elsewhere and the array itself become garbage
[11:58:50] <Eviltwin> Including the memory used to store all of the pointers
[11:59:12] <Eviltwin> Unless his goal is to preserve other references to the array (not likely the case as he asked how to empty it)
[11:59:23] <Eviltwin> .length = 0 is almost certainly more efficient
[11:59:42] <NoiseEee> i see
[11:59:53] <Infinitas> does anyone know about how to make cross-domain ajax post work?
[12:00:08] <Eviltwin> Infinitas: see ?sop
[12:00:08] <bot-t> Infinitas, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[12:00:16] <Eviltwin> SOP can't be violated by AJAX
[12:00:37] <Infinitas> what about using CORS?
[12:00:43] <danzik17> Infinitas: is this on the internet or on an intranet?
[12:00:48] <snover> CORS is not available on all browsers
[12:00:53] <Infinitas> internet
[12:01:32] <Infinitas> well, as long as FF and a few others work it should be fine I think
[12:01:46] <danzik17> eh, you could write a silverlight app to do your POST for you, but JS support may be iffy
[12:02:38] <chrisalexthomas> hi, I'm having a problem with on() and perhaps it a misunderstanding on my part
[12:03:12] <austinbv> how gracefully does jquery upgrade?
[12:03:31] <chrisalexthomas> I've got $(".rate_list .table_actions").on("click","a.save",function(){...}) and when I click on an area of table_actions, this event fires, but I thought that it would only apply if I clicked any a.save internally to the table_actions div?
[12:03:39] <chrisalexthomas> but this isn't the case in my example and I don't really know why
[12:04:24] <chrisalexthomas> I've got a breakpoint on the first line of the method and it's firing when I click anywhere in the .table_actions div
[12:04:50] <danzik17> chrisalexthomas: can you make a jsfiddle
[12:05:10] <chrisalexthomas> hmmmm, I Dunno how tbh....
[12:05:39] <danzik17> you just type code in to it.  www.jsfiddle.net
[12:05:40] <NoiseEee> chrisalexthomas: $(el).on('click',function(ev) { var el = $(ev.target); console.log('you clicked on '+el); })
[12:06:09] <NoiseEee> chrisalexthomas: everything in the <div> will fire the click event; query the target to see if its something you care about.
[12:06:49] <danzik17> NoiseEee: why would you ever want to do that when you can a delegate selector instead?
[12:06:53] <NoiseEee> chrisalexthomas: alternatively, include the "a" stuff in your initial "on" selector
[12:07:08] <chrisalexthomas> NoiseEee: yeah I Got that part, but I thought if I did $(el).on("click",".selector",function(ev){}); it would only activate on elements inside "el" which matched .selector
[12:07:28] <chrisalexthomas> NoiseEee: what I am trying to do, is use delegated events, so I can automatically bind to clone'd nodes I create in my dom
[12:07:28] <Kzim> hi i would like the know how do count how much children of a div with a specific class name please
[12:07:57] <udp> Kzim: $('#my_div').children('.my_class').length
[12:08:09] <chrisalexthomas> Kzim: $(".selector_of_div").childre.....yeah ok, was typing that :)
[12:08:22] <crtazyarun> hi
[12:08:27] <udp> Kzim: do you want grandchildren etc to be included?
[12:08:29] <crtazyarun> arun
[12:08:35] <NoiseEee> danzik17: dump 'delegate' in >= 1.7
[12:08:40] <crtazyarun> what?
[12:08:55] <Kzim> udp: not necessary i think
[12:09:17] <Kzim> udp, chrisalexthomas  thanks a lot !
[12:09:30] <danzik17> NoiseEee: i meant delegate as in event delegation.  ( as an aside, i'm still planning to use .delegate over .on for style reasons )
[12:09:43] <DynamicFail> eggnogg, I have been looking, but I don't understand your advice
[12:10:13] <Kzim> udp: my mistake :( i need the grand children :(((
[12:10:24] <chrisalexthomas> danzik17: yes, maybe you can see, I'm trying to delegate here
[12:10:28] <chrisalexthomas> thats what the selector was for
[12:10:45] <NoiseEee> chrisalexthomas: but why bother your way?  with your way you have to write a seperate $(el).on statement for all the selectors you want to target, which might as well be the same as $(el.selector).on....  do the selector/different event stuff in the main delegation function
[12:11:09] <chrisalexthomas> $(".rate_list .table_actions").on("click","a.save",function(){}) << on every .table_actions, monitor "click" events on any child which matches a.save
[12:11:36] <chrisalexthomas> NoiseEee: because my elements might not exist at page load time, they might be created dynamically, then I'd have to add code to attach event handlers all the time
[12:11:40] <NoiseEee> chrisalexthomas: right, but now if that table needs a different event handler for an element, you have to write that whole line again, with a different selector
[12:11:47] <NoiseEee> chrisalexthomas: this is exactly my poing.
[12:12:02] <chrisalexthomas> NoiseEee: so I wanted to use event delegation to mean I can monitor any click on any future node or any node which already exists
[12:12:17] <NoiseEee> chrisalexthomas: i understand, you're going about it incorrectly
[12:12:21] <snagnever> hi! if i'm downloading a content to write inside a div, with ajax, this content must or must not have <html><head> tags?
[12:12:29] <chrisalexthomas> NoiseEee: well, I understood that delegation would mean I setup a pattern and it would apply it for me
[12:12:31] <xrated> snagnever, correct
[12:12:34] <chrisalexthomas> NoiseEee: oh ok
[12:12:41] <xrated> que pasa mufasas
[12:12:57] <NoiseEee> chrisalexthomas: $(el).on('click',clickDelegator);    where function "clickDelegator" figures out what was clicked by class, tag, etc etc...
[12:13:02] <danzik17> NoiseEee: i wouldn't be so sure.  your way will work, yes - you are going to end up with massive event handlers that won't be easily understandable with that style.
[12:13:08] <chrisalexthomas> NoiseEee: well, basically, if I create another a.save in a different .table_actions, I never want to attach event handlers explicitly, if I can do that
[12:13:08] <snagnever> xrated: which part is correct? :P NOT HAVING the tags?
[12:13:15] <xrated> Yes, not having the tags
[12:13:19] <snagnever> thanks ;D
[12:13:22] <NoiseEee> chrisalexthomas: i understand, yes thats what happens
[12:13:32] <chrisalexthomas> NoiseEee: well, thats not event delegation, thats simple events as jquery has had since the very beginning
[12:13:40] <NoiseEee> ...
[12:13:42] <NoiseEee> best of luck
[12:13:44] <xrated> What's the issue here
[12:14:01] <chrisalexthomas> NoiseEee: basically, if I had 10,000 nodes to attach that handler to, you're method would mean attaching 10,000 event handlers
[12:14:14] <NoiseEee> chrisalexthomas: no, its adding a *single* handler on the common parent
[12:14:19] <NoiseEee> chrisalexthomas: once, and one time only
[12:14:42] <chrisalexthomas> whereas I'm trying to attach a single event handler and then let the "sub-selector" determine whether the handler should run
[12:14:43] <NoiseEee> chrisalexthomas: then your "clickDelegator" function (or whatever) finds out what element in the parent was clicked, and if you care about it, do something.
[12:14:50] <danzik17> chrisalexthomas: no, that's not it.  using .on( "click" ) on the parent will still work since events will stil bubble.  NoiseEee is suggesting using an if or something to filter the element in the handler ( which i heavily disagree with )
[12:15:15] <Eviltwin> chrisalexthomas: Can you reproduce your issue in jsFiddle?
[12:15:21] <chrisalexthomas> yes, i understand what he has suggested
[12:15:25] <Eviltwin> If it's still an issue
[12:15:31] <Eviltwin> I just got back
[12:15:44] <xrated> What's the problem
[12:16:07] <DynamicFail> Eviltwin, I'm still not able to get that div to duplicate... I am having trouble following eggnogg's directions
[12:16:10] <NoiseEee> danzik17: unless im on crack, what i have defined is precisely event delegation.
[12:16:10] <DynamicFail> any ideas?
[12:16:11] <chrisalexthomas> but I understood that $(el).on("click",".subselector",function(){}); would ONLY fire when .subselector elements are clicked INSIDE el and would apply to any future node connected anywhere in any other node, so I would hnot have to explicilty create new event handlers
[12:16:15] <chrisalexthomas> I've got that part correct right?
[12:16:27] <danzik17> NoiseEee: where did i say it wasn't?
[12:16:41] <udp> chrisalexthomas: yes
[12:16:48] <chrisalexthomas> NoiseEee: yes, but manual delegation, it's delegation yes, but if everyone could do it that way, why bother with live() ?
[12:16:56] <chrisalexthomas> I mean, live is the predecessor to what I want
[12:17:07] <danzik17> chrisalexthomas: really, just make a ?jsfiddle
[12:17:09] <chrisalexthomas> I can do it the manual way yes, but I prefer to do it the new way, if I can do it
[12:17:17] <chrisalexthomas> danzik17: I am, but people are tlaking :)
[12:17:20] <JackStoner> Hello. I need to apply an attr on one element and when i click the next remove the attr on the previous element. How do i do this?
[12:17:25] <NoiseEee> chrisalexthomas: because you should be moving to "on".  live() is not the preferred means.
[12:17:28] <udp> chrisalexthomas: pretty sure .on() does what you want
[12:17:48] <chrisalexthomas> NoiseEee: I know, which is why I am trying to use on() which is the upgraded live()
[12:18:06] <NoiseEee> chrisalexthomas: and should you decide that something else in your table needs to do something when clicked, you now have to write (el).on("click",".aTotallyDifferentSelector",function(){});
[12:18:15] <Eviltwin> DynamicFail: Is this is a fiddle?
[12:18:39] <xrated> NoiseEee, what's wrong with that, exactly
[12:18:42] <Eviltwin> chrisalexthomas: jsfiddle.net be sure to set it to jQuery
[12:19:11] <Eviltwin> chrisalexthomas: The HTML section goes in the <BODY>, the JavaScript section goes in a <SCRIPT> tag in the <HEAD> and the CSS section goes in a <STYLE> tag in the <HEAD>
[12:19:28] <NoiseEee> xrated: nothing, but if you've got say 5 different 'clickable' things in the table, id personally put a single listener on the table and not set 5 different .on() handlers
[12:19:50] <xrated> I'd split them up for readability
[12:20:04] <danzik17> xrated: +50.  and testability.
[12:20:14] <DynamicFail> Eviltwin, http://jsfiddle.net/m2YeQ/1/
[12:20:15] <chrisalexthomas> NoiseEee: that is exactly the way I want it to be honest, it's what I want
[12:20:34] <chrisalexthomas> I don't want a massive click handler which also does my dirty laundry and perhaps drives me to work in it's space car :)
[12:20:35] <NoiseEee> fair enough
[12:20:47] <xrated> Using even delegation, it doesn't matter if there are 5 clickable things per row and there are 1000 rows, the event will bubble up. So it's not a huge memory whore or anything >.>
[12:21:09] <Eviltwin> DynamicFail: So what's your goal with this?
[12:22:21] <nickSwe> How do I set multiple options for a jQueryUI dialog at the same time? I know how to set ONE new option, but there should be a way to do multiple changes at the same time right? I.e. I want to change "option", "width" 700, "option", "height", 500      at the same time... Any idea?
[12:22:23] <DynamicFail> Eviltwin, When I drag the Video from the top bar, I want it to remain there, and just pull a copy. I eventually will have multiple lower bars, and I want to be able to drag and drop things from the top to the bottom.
[12:22:43] <NoiseEee> anyways chrisalexthomas, http://jsfiddle.net/PzwEh/
[12:22:47] <KBM> hey guys I'm having css issue when i do element.show(0, callback)
[12:22:56] <KBM> but when i do element.show()
[12:23:02] <KBM> no issues...
[12:23:25] <KBM> whats the default params for show() ??
[12:24:05] <KBM> or at any rate, i need a callback for when the show() in finished… any ideas?
[12:24:21] <Jon47> KBM lets see a fiddle
[12:24:37] <KBM> very large project.
[12:25:06] <KBM> what i can say for sure is, when i say: el.show() it works
[12:25:26] <KBM> when i try to put in a callback it messes up..
[12:26:18] <KBM> el.css('display', '')
[12:26:22] <KBM> also works
[12:26:31] <KBM> but like i said.. i need a callback :(
[12:26:40] <Eviltwin> DynamicFail: I haven't played with draggable/droppable/sortable much
[12:26:46] <Eviltwin> DynamicFail: But someone was in here earlier with this: http://jsfiddle.net/bJGgH/8/
[12:26:49] <Eviltwin> Might help
[12:27:17] <DynamicFail> sick
[12:28:03] <elux> can you guys recommend a way to parse a URI ? .. specifically the URIs in it ..
[12:28:08] <elux> is there something in jquery or something external?

[12:28:44] <schuranator> I have a dumb question. I'm trying to use custom markers for my google map. So I made a bunch of variables for the different markers. Now my issue is in the array of locations I have what marker should be used as a string but that doesn't work what would be the best way to get this to work?
[12:29:19] <Eviltwin> Entomo: Have you looked at this? https://github.com/allmarkedup/jQuery-URL-Parser
[12:30:03] <Entomo> I have not.  Why?
[12:30:09] <Eviltwin> Sorry
[12:30:16] <Eviltwin> elux: Have you looked at this? https://github.com/allmarkedup/jQuery-URL-Parser
[12:30:19] <Eviltwin> Wrong person
[12:35:36] <elux> thx
[12:35:50] <nickSwe> is there some way to set multiple options for a jQueryUI dialog at the same time, instead of repeating $("#formholder").dialog("option", "width", 400); and then $("#formholder").dialog("option", "height", 400); etc etc... Can you pass a array of options and values at the same time perhaps??
[12:37:09] <Olof> Hello, Im trying to implement som jquery into my website, and I am trying to pass variables between pages, using .load
[12:37:10] <Olof> http://jsfiddle.net/tT6sd/2/
[12:37:15] <Eviltwin> nickSwe: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138135/Widget-factory
[12:37:47] <Eviltwin> Likely .dialog("options", {"width": 400, "height": 400})
[12:37:56] <Olof> how should I pickup the variables? PM me =)
[12:38:36] <Eviltwin> Olof: I think you need to learn JavaScript
[12:38:41] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ Olof
[12:38:42] <bot-t> Olof, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[12:39:11] <nickSwe> Eviltwin: thanks!
[12:39:24] <DynamicFail> Eviltwin, I don't know how extensively you document these examples... but I changed it to English if you keep track of that sort of thing: http://jsfiddle.net/bJGgH/22/
[12:39:37] <Olof> okey So there is no easy solution for this? because this all the code I need
[12:39:45] <Olof> when it works the way I want
[12:40:07] <Eviltwin> DynamicFail: These aren't mine and I haven't started tracking them yet but I might soon
[12:40:14] <Eviltwin> I just remembered it from a few hours ago and searched my logs
[12:40:35] <DynamicFail> Its crazy how much he/she was able to do with so few lines
[12:40:52] <DynamicFail> I looked at some later updates and it was pretty nice
[12:41:31] <Eviltwin> Don't forget all the jQuery UI source code involved :P
[12:41:47] <Eviltwin> The total of jQuery UI is like 100k-200k
[12:42:30] <Olof> Eviltwin: do you know what I want to do?
[12:42:40] <Eviltwin> Olof: Nope
[12:42:56] <Olof> but you did look at my pasted example?
[12:43:03] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[12:43:13] <Eviltwin> ANd that's why I linked you that learn thing
[12:43:21] <Olof> okioki, but still
[12:43:37] <Olof> I just want to send a variable to get.php using .load
[12:43:39] <Eviltwin> Because I think there's some fundamental misunderstanding about JavaScript and jQuery syntax
[12:43:47] <Olof> are you saying thats not possible
[12:43:49] <Eviltwin> ?load @ Olof
[12:43:49] <bot-t> Olof, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[12:43:55] <Eviltwin> Err
[12:44:01] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[12:44:11] <Eviltwin> It shows all the options there
[12:44:12] <jscheel> join #css
[12:44:14] <jscheel> oops
[12:45:05] <Eviltwin> Olof: You'll see you can't specify query params for .load
[12:45:18] <Olof> hmm
[12:45:18] <Eviltwin> Olof: But it also tells you that .load works by using $.get
[12:45:41] <Eviltwin> And $.get does accept params
[12:45:43] <DynamicFail> I can't really figure out how to use what they did for my project
[12:45:46] <DynamicFail> but it's pretty nice
[12:46:06] <Eviltwin> Or maybe I misread the .load page and just lied to you
[12:46:16] <Eviltwin> Either way, RTFM :P
[12:46:28] <Olof> haha, ok will look into $.get instead
[12:46:41] <Eviltwin> DynamicFail: IMO, jQuery UI is kind of a clusterfuck
[12:46:56] <Eviltwin> It does a ton of stuff but wraps it all so tightly
[12:47:18] <Eviltwin> That you're kind of locked into their decisions about how these things would be used
[12:47:50] <DynamicFail> is there a jquery-ui
[12:47:53] <DynamicFail> room?
[12:49:14] <Eviltwin> There used to be
[12:49:21] <Eviltwin> Now it's "supported" here
[12:49:55] <DynamicFail> hmm
[12:59:42] <ProLoser|Work> anyone use tinymce?
[13:00:58] <devc> Anyone have SoundManager2 experience? My soundManager.url isn't being set all the time - intermittently - resulting in the swf file 404'ing, meaning no sound in IE/Firefox
[13:02:45] <kryl> how to get name value in <input name="efef"> ? this.name ??
[13:04:15] <scr3am> kryl: .attr('name')
[13:05:26] <kryl> scr3am, thx
[13:05:51] <scr3am> yq
[13:05:53] <scr3am> yw
[13:07:25] <Olof> Eviltwin: I can still not get variable sent to the php using post, http://jsfiddle.net/YsknT/
[13:07:34] <Olof> can you help my maybe?
[13:09:41] <mordof> Is there a particular reason why firebug isn't letting me load a page when it's active now using jquery? I keep getting - reference to undefined property jQuery.valHooks[this]
[13:10:10] <emilio> hi, somebody can help me ?
[13:10:26] <mordof> emilio: don't ask to ask, just ask
[13:10:35] <mordof> if someone can help you, they will
[13:10:49] <mordof> well - obviously other variables play a part.. but anyway - just ask, lol
[13:12:18] <emilio> this doesn't work for me: miTabla.$cabecera.append(str); but this yes: $(miTabla.$cabecera.selector).append(str);. Why ?
[13:12:46] <chrisvwebdev> Olof: what is in get.php?
[13:12:54] <mordof> emilio: pastbin your code please
[13:12:58] <mordof> relevant code
[13:13:29] <Olof> chrisvwebdev: stuff that needs a variable from prevoiusly page
[13:14:02] <emilio> 		var miTabla =  		{ 			'config': { 				contenedor: $("#miTabla") 			}, 			 			'init': function(config) { 				if (config && typeof(config) == 'object') { 					$.extend(miTabla.config, config); 				} 				 				miTabla.$contenedor = miTabla.config.contenedor; 				miTabla.$cabecera = miTabla.$contenedor.find('thead'); 				miTabla.crearEncabezado(); 			}, 			 			'crearEncabezado': function() { 				var str = '<tr>'; 				for(var i = 0; i < Ob
[13:14:05] <Olof> $_POST['x'], just waiting for x
[13:14:09] <emilio> ops wait
[13:14:29] <mordof> :\ heh
[13:15:26] <KWhat_Work> If I add a script tag to the dom it will not execute javascript in that tag correct?
[13:15:45] <mordof> KWhat_Work: why wouldn't it?
[13:16:01] <mordof> and how else would you expect it to execute?
[13:16:03] <KWhat_Work> mordof: idk because the page is has already been loaded
[13:16:25] <mordof> KWhat_Work: you're adding to the page - telling it to load something more. javascript is dynamic
[13:16:34] <mordof> yes, it will execute the script you add to the page
[13:16:44] <mordof> otherwise there would be no reason to add it to the page
[13:16:48] <KWhat_Work> ok so dom modifications will cause execution ... mmm will the ready event fire?
[13:17:01] <Eviltwin> Why would the ready event fire?
[13:17:10] <Eviltwin> The document is already ready
[13:17:37] <mordof> in some browsers it may work, in others it may not - that event isn't a good one to depend upon for many cases
[13:17:46] <chrisvwebdev> Olof: so this is rather obvious, but i assume you are doing and echo to see if the post var is in your php file?
[13:18:10] <mordof> Eviltwin: the ready event isn't specific to just the DOM loading initially. its *somewhat* supported in many other elements.. but often times browsers don't get it right
[13:18:42] <Olof> chrisvwebdev: yes, you are right
[13:18:43] <Eviltwin> What other elements in what other browsers?
[13:19:06] <mordof> KWhat_Work: I wouldn't rely on it, no. there are other ways to test for that though
[13:19:42] <Olof> but I only get "undefined variable 'x'"
[13:20:11] <WebDragon> heya folkz. got an interesting fancybox issue with chrome/ff -- the video (youtube link) example on fancyapps.com works just fine (and it works on my site in opera as well, just fine) but when in chrome, the video just opens -- not within an iframe
[13:20:15] <mordof> Eviltwin: images for one. I haven't looked into what browsers actually work with different sets of ready events for loading - I just avoid using it.
[13:20:27] <WebDragon> I don't know exactly what the problem is and nothing shows up in the console to explain why it doesn't do the iframe mode
[13:20:46] <WebDragon> the site is devel.santafemexicangrill.net - the video is at the bottom right
[13:20:53] <Eviltwin> mordof: Images have a "ready"?
[13:20:59] <Eviltwin> What does the "ready" even mean in that case?
[13:21:07] <Eviltwin> You're not talking about "load"?
[13:21:19] <WebDragon> opera, it opens in the fancybox. chrome, it takes you directly to the video on youtube's site but since it's embed-mode it opens as the full size of the browser window
[13:21:59] <WebDragon> been digging around the fancybox forum but can't find anything that specifically mentions my problem
[13:22:21] <chrisvwebdev> Olof: do you have firebug?
[13:22:30] <Olof> yes
[13:22:35] <Olof> just installed it
[13:22:40] <chrisvwebdev> open it and go to the Net tab
[13:22:44] <chrisvwebdev> then when you are there
[13:22:57] <chrisvwebdev> click on the XHR sub men selection
[13:23:03] <mordof> Eviltwin: maybe? it's possible I'm a bit behind in this area
[13:23:05] * mordof shrugs
[13:23:12] * WebDragon headscratches
[13:23:21] <chrisvwebdev> you should see the server response to your .post request there
[13:23:28] <chrisvwebdev> i have it working fine
[13:23:30] <chrisvwebdev> no problems
[13:24:08] <Eviltwin> mordof: DOMContentReady (what .ready() i sa shortcut for in jQuery) is the document-level event that indicates that the HTML has been parsed and the DOM has been created
[13:24:25] <Eviltwin> Before DOMConentReady, the document is empty
[13:25:09] <Eviltwin> "load" is once all images and other resources have been loaded
[13:25:21] <Eviltwin> DOMContentReady happens before load
[13:25:22] <Olof> chrisvwebdev: I have the lite version (only for chrome) dont think XHR is there...
[13:25:34] <chrisvwebdev> you need to grab firefox
[13:25:41] <chrisvwebdev> that will help.
[13:25:54] <Olof> oki...
[13:26:10] <chrisvwebdev> inside the xhr area, it shows the .post method is doing this:
[13:26:35] <chrisvwebdev> Parametersapplication/x-www-form-urlencoded            name John time 2pm Sourcename=John&time=2pm
[13:26:55] <chrisvwebdev> it is passing the "name" and "time" values i defined like this in my html:
[13:27:19] <emilio> hello, why this doesn't work for me: miTabla.$cabecera.append(str); and this yes: $(miTabla.$cabecera.selector).append(str); ?
[13:27:30] <chrisvwebdev> $.post("./get.php", { name: "John", time: "2pm" });
[13:27:38] <emilio> 	<table id="miTabla">
[13:27:38] <emilio> 		<thead></thead>
[13:27:38] <emilio> 		<tbody></tbody>
[13:27:38] <emilio> 	</table>
[13:27:43] <Eviltwin> emilio: miTabla.$cabecera is a DOM element in that case
[13:27:50] <chrisvwebdev> my php file does this:
[13:27:51] <Eviltwin> $(miTabla.$cabecera) makes it a jQuery object
[13:27:51] <chrisvwebdev> <?php
[13:27:51] <chrisvwebdev> 	echo $_POST['name'];
[13:27:52] <chrisvwebdev> ?>
[13:27:52] <bot-t> ...
[13:28:01] <Eviltwin> jQuery objects have methods like .append()
[13:28:03] <emilio> 		var miTabla =
[13:28:03] <emilio> 		{
[13:28:03] <emilio> 			'config': {
[13:28:03] <emilio> 				contenedor: $("#miTabla")
[13:28:03] <emilio> 			},
[13:28:28] <emilio> sorry about flood
[13:28:32] <mordof> emilio: paste your code to pastebin.com or some other pasting service, not the channel
[13:28:35] <chrisvwebdev> and firebug will show you the response in the XHR Tab.  things are looking as they should.  you need to look at firebug to see the response.
[13:28:41] <emilio> ok thx
[13:28:44] <Eviltwin> Someone can repeat my answer to him if he lost it
[13:28:45] <Eviltwin> I gotta  go
[13:28:54] <mordof> Eviltwin: yep
[13:29:01] <Olof> ok, chrisvwebdev  thanks, I will try it
[13:29:36] <chrisvwebdev> sure, it's easy.  your php echo will not show anything on the screen from the .post method
[13:29:37] <Olof> just gonna install this elephant browser :P
[13:30:08] <Olof> what, what do you mena not show anything?
[13:30:08] <chrisvwebdev> either way, firefox+firebug is your best bet at testing ajax requests easily
[13:30:26] <mordof> chrome's developer tools aren't all that bad either
[13:30:49] <chrisvwebdev> you will not see the echo on screen..  the post method will send data to the php file, then handle a response.
[13:31:19] <chrisvwebdev> you can't reference get.php and expect the value of X to print on the screen
[13:31:42] <emilio> hello, why this doesn't work for me: miTabla.$cabecera.append(str); and this yes: $(miTabla.$cabecera.selector).append(str); ?
[13:31:43] <emilio> http://pastebin.com/PgKftsXA
[13:31:52] <mordof> checking
[13:33:07] <Olof> ahha ok I get it, but $('#anyDiv').post... would fix this right?
[13:33:23] <Olof> and the echo will be visible
[13:34:13] <emilio> ok thx
[13:35:49] <deweydb> hi
[13:35:57] <deweydb> can someone please explain the difference between "> div > h3" and "div > h3" to me?
[13:36:05] <deweydb> from here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/sortable.html
[13:36:59] <emilio> dewydb i believe second one is less restrive
[13:37:21] <emilio> it returns more results
[13:37:33] <mordof> hm?
[13:37:39] <emilio> '>' for the first occurrence ?
[13:37:39] <mordof> right
[13:37:49] <Misiur> nope
[13:37:49] <mordof> deweydb: the > is for parent to child
[13:38:00] <mordof> so > is saying the div must be at the top level
[13:38:01] <Misiur> It gets only children divs
[13:38:55] <emilio> mordof did you see the paste ?
[13:39:13] <mordof> deweydb: in this case, the "> div > h3" is being applied to the #accordion parent, so it will only pick up the immediate div and h3 child
[13:39:24] <mordof> emilio: yes, but i still haven't figured out why that's the case - it should be working
[13:39:36] <emilio> :'(
[13:39:44] <emilio> I Knew!!!
[13:40:07] <mordof> deweydb: to give more detail, the div that's after the h3 WON'T be picked up by that selector since it's nested too deeply and isn't a direct child of #accordion
[13:40:13] <emilio> I believe it could be because of the version of jquery ?
[13:40:21] <mordof> emilio: doubtful
[13:40:53] <mordof> emilio: the way you're using .find has been available since 1.6
[13:41:12] <mordof> argh, why are you using 1.6.2, lol.. even still - it should be fine
[13:41:30] <emilio> lol
[13:41:47] <jtal> what do people like for tables?
[13:41:53] <emilio> I'm more than four hours with it
[13:41:58] <WebDragon> gahhh why is it doing this
[13:42:12] <chrisvwebdev> Olof:
[13:42:12] * WebDragon pokes chrome some more and pokes firefox on the roundabout
[13:42:23] <mordof> WebDragon: ?
[13:42:29] <chrisvwebdev> Olof: put this in your html file: 	$(document).ready(function(){
[13:42:29] <chrisvwebdev> 		$.post("./get.php", { name: "John"},
[13:42:29] <chrisvwebdev> 	  		function(data){
[13:42:29] <chrisvwebdev> 	    			alert("the server response: name="+data);
[13:42:29] <chrisvwebdev> 			});	
[13:42:29] <chrisvwebdev> 	});
[13:42:35] <WebDragon> whyinhell does this work properly in opera but not in FF/chrome
[13:42:47] <mordof> chrisvwebdev: don't paste to the channel please, paste to a pasting service
[13:42:49] <chrisvwebdev> put this in get.php:  <?php
[13:42:49] <chrisvwebdev> 	echo $_POST['name'];
[13:42:49] <chrisvwebdev> ?>
[13:42:50] <bot-t> ...
[13:42:54] <mordof> WebDragon: link?
[13:42:54] <chrisvwebdev> oh ok
[13:42:55] <chrisvwebdev> no problem
[13:43:04] <mordof> chrisvwebdev: thanks
[13:43:06] <WebDragon> mordof: devel.santafemexicangrill.net -- added a fancybox to a video link so it does the iframeing of the video.
[13:43:29] <WebDragon> mordof: click in chrome and it skips the fancybox and goes straight to the full-browser-width video and takes you off the website
[13:43:54] <WebDragon> nothing shows up in the console to explain, or if it does I'm missing it because it jacks me off the site before I can see anything
[13:44:01] <Olof> chrisvwebdev: thanks, its so easy to be blind when I look at the code
[13:44:20] <Olof> since im not using jquery
[13:44:26] <Olof> often
[13:45:52] <nickSwe> how can I make one character in a button text underlined? for example: text: "<u>L</u>ogin"   << that does not work, it will simply print out the <u> element, and not make it underlined (this is for showing which key is the button accesskey)
[13:47:32] <chrisvwebdev> @ Olof: no problem. as long as you get what you need.
[13:47:33] <chrisvwebdev> no worries
[13:47:59] <mordof> OH
[13:48:08] <WebDragon> mordof: you figured it out?
[13:48:08] <mordof> hmm
[13:48:48] <mordof> WebDragon: sorry, working on several things at once, lol
[13:48:53] <mordof> that wasn't in re: for what you asked
[13:48:53] <NoiseEee> nickSwe: http://jsfiddle.net/
[13:48:58] <mordof> but i'm checking that shortly
[13:49:03] <NoiseEee> nickSwe: http://jsfiddle.net/SJMZC/
[13:49:16] <WebDragon> mordof: oh okay :)
[13:49:49] <Funksmaname> hello - jquery noob here, just trying to create a simple mouseover action to reveal a lable, which works, except if you mouse over the lable area it bounces in and out... http://jsfiddle.net/Funksmaname/R6GHz/3/ any help much appreciated!
[13:50:10] <mordof> emilio: your 'config': contenedor: $("#miTabla") is being called before the DOM is ready i think..
[13:50:25] <nickSwe> NoiseEee: I am talking about jQueryUI dialog button... Not regular <button> element.
[13:50:36] <mordof> emilio: when i did console.log(miTabla.$cabecera); inside the function, it showed an empty result set - meaning no thead was found
[13:50:44] <mordof> emilio: so that's the most likely case
[13:50:44] <NoiseEee> nickSwe: sorry my ESP was off
[13:51:01] <mordof> that's why it works when you specify the selector in the init, because THAT part is being run after the DOM  is ready
[13:52:17] <emilio> wait i'm reading
[13:52:25] <mordof> emilio: it works fine if you define miTabla inside the ready call
[13:53:36] <emilio> xD
[13:53:40] <emilio> shit
[13:53:45] <emilio> thanks you a lotttttttttt
[13:54:36] <mordof> emilio: you're welcome :)
[13:54:41] <mordof> WebDragon: on to your problem, heh
[13:54:59] * WebDragon slides the carafe of DragonCoffee™ over to mordof 
[13:55:17] <Funksmaname> i'm guessing that when the P is being shown it's obscuring the a - which creates a mouseout? *confused*
[13:56:13] <mordof> Funksmaname: just read through your initial post and checking the link. on first guess without looking i'd say you've got an issue with event propogation where you don't want it
[13:56:21] <emilio> now i can go on with my life! lol!! thanks you mordof! bye!
[13:56:59] <mordof> Funksmaname: that jsfiddle has no mouseout?
[13:57:20] <Funksmaname> mordof: http://jsfiddle.net/Funksmaname/R6GHz/3/ ?
[13:57:29] <mordof> WebDragon: i'm going through the fancyBox code currently - never used it before so i have to make sure it's getting what it expects
[13:57:34] <mordof> Funksmaname: that's the one i'm looking at, yes
[13:57:39] <WebDragon> I really gotta watch that jquery debugging slideshare presentation when I actually have the calm surroundings around me so that I'm not surrounded by distractions
[13:57:42] <mordof> there's only a mouseover
[13:57:53] <Funksmaname> mordof: weird, this isn't the latest version...
[13:57:55] <Funksmaname> hold please
[13:58:18] <Funksmaname> mordof: http://jsfiddle.net/Funksmaname/R6GHz/5/
[13:58:19] <StPiere> is there some alternative to scrollLeft ?
[13:58:29] <WebDragon> mordof: if you go to http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/#examples and scroll down until you see "Youtube link" and click it in chrome, it works
[13:58:34] <Funksmaname> mordof: /3/ was latest on my screen but link was showing old one
[13:58:37] <WebDragon> no idea why it's not working now  on my own page
[13:58:53] <b-lew> What am I doing wrong here?
[13:58:54] <b-lew> http://jsfiddle.net/Rdt48/
[13:59:08] <WebDragon> demo page uses 1.7 and I
[13:59:12] <Funksmaname> mordof: it works if you mouse over the gray
[13:59:17] <WebDragon> 'm on 1.7.1 so that shouldn't be a problem
[13:59:28] <Funksmaname> mordof: but if you put mouse near the bottom it bounces
[13:59:29] <WebDragon> heya ben_alman -- ltns
[13:59:41] <ben_alman> yo
[14:01:24] <mordof> Funksmaname: yep, i was right - http://jsfiddle.net/R6GHz/6/
[14:01:42] <mordof> Funksmaname: there's a difference between mouseenter and mouseover, same with mouseout/mouseleave
[14:01:58] <mordof> Funksmaname: you'll want to research the difference - it has to do with event bubbling
[14:02:18] <Funksmaname> ooh
[14:02:20] <Funksmaname> ok
[14:02:25] <mordof> Funksmaname: the reason was that mouseover/mouseout are triggering on children of the anchor element as well as the anchor element itself
[14:02:41] <Funksmaname> bubbling is something i've not done since university :)
[14:03:01] <mordof> hm
[14:03:17] <Funksmaname> mordof: thanks a lot - that really helps
[14:03:25] <mordof> Funksmaname: you're welcome
[14:03:28] <Funksmaname> mordof: I'll read up
[14:04:53] <mordof> WebDragon: oh, i think i found your problem, heh
[14:05:14] <Guddu> Hi All....I need some help with creating a form which shows up as a secondary window when we click a button.....I want something similar to what they have in https://demo.phppointofsale.com/ ....if you go to that site and click login and then select items and then select add item you willl see the popup that I am talking about. I wanted to know how this popup was made. Is it using jscript or jquery or ajax? Please help.
[14:05:16] <mordof> WebDragon: don't add an src="" tag to a script tag that has inline javascript
[14:05:28] <WebDragon> mordof: doh!
[14:05:33] <mordof> WebDragon: it's loading the ENTIRE PAGE AGAIN inside that script section instead of your inline code
[14:05:41] <mordof> WebDragon: thus making your js not parse correctly :)
[14:06:12] <mordof> man i'm 3 for 3 on finding odd problems that are indirectly the cause, lol
[14:06:20] <mordof> :D
[14:06:32] <WebDragon> mordof: is it fixed now in chrome? (just updated mine and selinux found textrels so it won't start yet til I work around that)
[14:06:38] <WebDragon> :D
[14:07:10] <mordof> WebDragon: i didn't try it in chrome, lol.. i suppose i can check it
[14:07:39] <mordof> works in firefox now
[14:07:47] <mordof> checking chrome
[14:08:13] <WebDragon> yeah works in ff now (tried it on wine too)
[14:08:25] <mordof> what browser in wine?
[14:08:28] <WebDragon> Firefox
[14:08:41] <mordof> o.O
[14:08:48] <mordof> why would you run firefox in Wine?
[14:08:48] <mordof> what OS are you on?
[14:09:00] <mordof> works in chrome
[14:09:01] <WebDragon> Fedora
[14:09:12] <WebDragon> I run an extra FF in wine just for testing purposes
[14:09:19] <mordof> that's.. odd...
[14:09:27] <Columcille> quite
[14:09:31] <Guddu> Hi All....I need some help with creating a form which shows up as a secondary window when we click a button.....I want something similar to what they have in https://demo.phppointofsale.com/ ....if you go to that site and click login and then select items and then select add item you willl see the popup that I am talking about.

[14:09:34] <WebDragon> plus quickbooks doesn't want to see FF that's not running under what claims to be windows, mordof
[14:09:38] <WebDragon> very annoying
[14:09:52] <WebDragon> for the longest time I had to run IEs4Linux just to enter shit in quickbooks on fedora
[14:10:10] <mordof> you run quickbooks in fedora?
[14:10:10] <WebDragon> then they finally made it accessible to Firefox but it insists that it needs to run in windows :P
[14:10:13] <WebDragon> they still don't get it
[14:10:17] <WebDragon> no just the data entry
[14:10:33] <mordof> WebDragon: why don't you run a VM?
[14:10:44] <mordof> WebDragon: it sounds like it would solve a lot of your troubles, lol
[14:10:49] <b-lew> http://jsfiddle.net/Rdt48/ -> can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong here?
[14:11:02] <mordof> b-lew: checking
[14:11:08] <WebDragon> mordof: https://accounting.quickbooks.com/ in ff under linux
[14:11:11] <b-lew> Thanks mordof
[14:11:19] <WebDragon> it was (last I checked) warning about not running under not windows
[14:11:42] <WebDragon> mordof: because I only just need this for the browser, I don't need a whole vm just to do data entry in a browser window
[14:15:20] <Columcille> WebDragon: You can change the user agent Firefox reports to the website, make the site think you're running Firefox on windows
[14:15:21] <mordof> b-lew: what about is isn't working? there's a lot of garbage in here that shouldn't be in jsfiddle
[14:15:46] <WebDragon> Columcille: tried that. wasn't as effective as I'd hoped
[14:16:02] <b-lew> well I was trying to follow this tutorial... http://css-tricks.com/convert-menu-to-dropdown/
[14:16:18] <b-lew> I want a dropdown nav when my sites browser is smaller.
[14:16:22] <b-lew> is that possible?
[14:16:58] <b-lew> Sorr mordof, I should have included your handle above^
[14:17:00] <WebDragon> http://tinypic.com/r/ioop7a/5
[14:17:15] <WebDragon> tried opening it in opera linux. latest version
[14:17:24] <WebDragon> intuit is still way behind the curve
[14:17:33] <WebDragon> useless bloody loonies
[14:18:36] <b-lew> there might be an easier way to do this. I'm no jquery expert mordof
[14:18:38] <Guddu> Could someone help please
[14:22:11] <h1ll37> in jquery how simple would it be to include a script on every link that checked if that link linked to the current page and if so give it a different class? I'm trying to do something dynamically for a theming engine and don't hinki can do it extremely dynamically in php
[14:24:38] <mordof> b-lew: hmm. I would suggest placing the select in the HTML code and not appending it after. Use the CSS to hide it by default, and show it only under the media settings you wnat
[14:25:11] <mordof> b-lew: by appending it with js you make the mobile browser reliant on javascript (and jquery) which isn't always a good idea. Smart phones with better browsers are more common, but lower quality browsers are still out there
[14:25:54] <b-lew> I see so basically have 2 menus ?
[14:25:59] <b-lew> one with select and one without
[14:26:45] * mordof nods
[14:26:56] <mordof> then simply use CSS to determine which to show, and leave out the js
[14:27:05] <mordof> well, as much js as you can
[14:27:13] <mordof> old mobile browsers don't support js too well
[14:27:44] <b-lew> mordof. i'll take out the js
[14:27:52] <b-lew> yea i understand
[14:28:15] <b-lew> so if i have .nav_container ul li{ display: inline-block; }
[14:28:32] <b-lew> then in my query i'll put .nav_container ul     { display: none; }       	.nav_container select { display: inline-block; }
[14:28:36] <b-lew> whoops
[14:32:34] <Funksmaname> how would I add a negative margin equal to the height of the current p element outerHeight? :S
[14:32:36] <waffles> is there a way to specify which key has been pressed in the keydown() / keyup() methods?
[14:34:59] <Funksmaname> could I offset it from the top based on its outerHeight?
[14:47:18] <Funksmaname> i've managed to calculate the first matched P height and give it a neg margine equal to that, but how do I make it work on an element by element basis? (2nd set offsets the same height as first set like this) http://jsfiddle.net/Funksmaname/PHyQq/5/
[14:48:06] <Funksmaname> i tried putting inside each of the enter/leave functions but couldn't get it to work ;(
[14:49:05] <LekeFly> Any reason that this should work? <a class="link-wishlist wishlist" rel='twipsy' title='Legg i ønskeliste' href="<?php echo $this->helper('wishlist')->getAddUrl($_product) ?>" class="link-wishlist"><?php echo $this->__('Add to Wishlist') ?></a>
[14:49:55] <jedimind> uhm
[14:49:59] <jedimind> so thats html and php
[14:50:04] <jedimind> both of which are not even javascript, let along jquery
[14:50:12] <jedimind> alone*
[14:51:26] <Funksmaname> if you look at my jsfiddle, could you also explain why mouseenter slideDown is actually a slideUp visually (which is what it should be but seems counterintuitive??)
[14:52:43] <amaroks> I have a small slideshow here, it has 2iomages only, the first transmission round is cool the second is corrupted, anyhelp is appreciated :( https://thexlo.com/gentletouch/facebookapp/
[14:52:44] <LekeFly> jedimind: Yeah.. bad explanation.. using the jquery tooltip script from twitter boostrap
[14:52:53] <LekeFly> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#twipsy
[14:54:49] <amaroks> I have a small slideshow here, it has 2iomages only, the first transmission round is cool the second is corrupted, anyhelp is appreciated :( https://thexlo.com/gentletouch/facebookapp/
[14:55:10] <Funksmaname> i guess its slididng down from its point of origin negatively (upwards)...
[14:55:19] <amaroks> whats the fix?
[14:56:05] <zatan> Hi, has anybody of you are using pjax ? I am having issue by making all <li> clickable  http://dpaste.com/682397/   is there anyway to make all <li> or <div> clickables ?
[14:58:43] <amaroks> I'm really surprised from this chanel , I have been getting guys to help from groups with less than 50 people :( ere there are 1k but unfortunately its completely silent :(
[14:59:30] <Funksmaname> 999 of us are here for help :P
[15:00:23] <amaroks> then Could you please tell me how can I fix the issue :( I would really appreciate it
[15:00:30] <amaroks> Funksmaname
[15:00:48] <Funksmaname> no, i mean, 999 of us are here because we have a problem, and only 1 knows the solution... which isn't me...
[15:01:03] <pifantastic> amaroks: sup?
[15:01:10] <amaroks> I have a small slideshow here, it has 2iomages only, the first transmission round is cool the second is corrupted, anyhelp is appreciated :( https://thexlo.com/gentletouch/facebookapp/
[15:01:16] <Funksmaname> you probably know more than I do...
[15:01:16] <amaroks> pifantastic
[15:01:50] <pifantastic> amaroks: looking
[15:02:03] <amaroks> pifantastic: thanks
[15:02:19] <Cine> is there a way you can send a post that's not an ajax request?
[15:02:29] <Cine> without using a form?
[15:02:38] <pifantastic> Cine: no
[15:02:44] <Cine> :(
[15:03:58] <pifantastic> Cine, why?
[15:04:32] <Cine> well I need to post data to another page, but not through a form
[15:05:30] <pifantastic> Cine: why not?
[15:06:16] <pifantastic> amaroks: can you reproduce your problem using jsfiddle.net? that will make it easier for me to collaboratively code with you.
[15:07:27] <Funksmaname> pifantastic: would you take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/Funksmaname/dQ8y5/1/ please?
[15:07:44] <pifantastic> Funksmaname: what's your problem?
[15:08:07] <Funksmaname> pifantastic: i've managed to, once you hover once, margin the label correctly... but if I put it outside the function it ounly takes the first result
[15:08:29] <Funksmaname> pifantastic: and if i calculate it before sliding then it returns 1
[15:09:02] <Funksmaname> pifantastic: is there a better way to calculate the P outerHeight BEFORE hiding but inidividually to each element
[15:09:54] <lrvick> So if i create an element with a bind on it, then stick that element in a list, then render it from the list, the bind works. If i destroy the elements in the dom, then redraw from the list a second time
[15:09:57] <lrvick> it does not work
[15:10:12] <amaroks> pifantastic: does the same thing there :(
[15:10:20] <pifantastic> amaroks: cool, link?
[15:10:23] <lrvick> Here is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/L679L/2/
[15:10:40] <lrvick> the function getGallery, works a second time
[15:10:47] <lrvick> however the binds fail to run
[15:11:27] <lrvick> (click an album, click "gallery" at the top, then click another album)
[15:11:33] <lrvick> which calls gerGallery a second time
[15:11:50] <lrvick> and redraws from cache
[15:12:15] <amaroks> pifantastic: how do I get a link like that?
[15:12:43] <pifantastic> save the fiddle
[15:12:47] <pifantastic> and look at the url
[15:12:52] <pifantastic> amaroks: ^
[15:14:08] <mody_> pifantastic http://jsfiddle.net/j82FD/
[15:14:42] <pifantastic> lrvick: whynot just hide elements instead of destroying them?
[15:14:58] <pifantastic> amaroks: == mody_ ?
[15:15:09] <mody_> oh yes
[15:15:38] <lrvick> pifantastic: because then i can easily deal with them all in one go, and do per-page effects more easily for my intended implementations
[15:15:40] <lrvick> regardless
[15:15:47] <lrvick> this feels like it _should__ work
[15:15:50] <lrvick> im not sure why binds
[15:15:52] <lrvick> are not persistant
[15:15:54] <lrvick> across more than oen draw
[15:17:22] <pifantastic> lrvick: I imagine you are caching *references* to DOM elements that die when you call empty()
[15:18:23] <lrvick> well i store the jquery objects in an array, then populate them to the dom from the arraty
[15:18:26] <lrvick> then remove them from teh dom
[15:18:32] <lrvick> tehn redraw from that array a second time
[15:18:46] <lrvick> at that point it works fine
[15:18:49] <lrvick> but the binds no llonger work
[15:19:45] <fatninja> I am using Jquery Validation Class, when I have a simple input type='submit' , that thing works ! , when I have a button that is handled by jquery and does $("#myform").submit() it shows the errors ( if any ) , so the validation is working and the submitHandler of the validation works as well, but !  it does not post. wtf?
[15:20:39] <pifantastic> lrvick: Yeah I think empty removes events to prevent memory leaks.
[15:21:47] <mody_> pifantastic: so any idea?
[15:21:58] <pifantastic> mody_: looking
[15:23:47] <fatninja> Problem solved : submitHandler: function() { => submitHandler: function(form) {     ( curious that it worked even without it )
[15:24:10] <pifantastic> mody_: you are removing the 'active' class every time
[15:24:16] <pifantastic> mody_: which means it starts with the same element every time
[15:24:31] <mody_> okay and How do I fix that?
[15:26:16] <mody_> pifantastic: How do I fix that?
[15:26:24] <pifantastic> mody_: looking
[15:28:08] <pifantastic> mody_: second problem: next() is not going to get the next image
[15:28:44] <rottenrec1> is it a bad idea to remove the version number from the jquery/jquery-ui library filename to avoid having to edit all my views every time i upgrade from one version to another?
[15:29:18] <pifantastic> rottenrec1: I dont think it's a bad idea
[15:29:49] <rottenrec1> ok, good
[15:30:04] <rottenrec1> pifantastic: do you do that, or do you just leave the version numbers in?
[15:30:18] <pifantastic> mody_: third problem, you are closing tags with <a\>, which is not valid HTML
[15:31:01] <pifantastic> rottenrec1: I usually just have the file as "jquery.min.js"
[15:32:05] <rottenrec1> gotcha
[15:34:02] <pifantastic> mody__: http://jsfiddle.net/j82FD/7/
[15:34:25] <sphinxxx> can anyone point me to a jsonp tutorial that uses php on the back end?
[15:34:26] <pifantastic> mody__: A few things, fadeIn() and fadeOut() are easier than animating opacity (they do the same thing)
[15:35:16] <pifantastic> sphinxxx: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jsonp+php
[15:35:22] <pifantastic> first link
[15:36:23] <pifantastic> mody__: you might want to brush up on how DOM traversal works with jQuery, (next(), parent() etc)
[15:43:16] <alasdair64220> Hi,
[15:43:18] <alasdair64220> Today I've been learning about changes to attr() and prop() in jquery 1.61. I understand why prop is preferred to attr for getting the status.
[15:43:22] <alasdair64220> But it's not clear to me what I should do when I want to check the input box in my script. Should I do
[15:43:26] <alasdair64220>  $("input[type=checkbox]").prop("checked", true);
[15:43:28] <alasdair64220>  $("input[type=checkbox]").attr("checked", true);
[15:43:32] <alasdair64220> or something else, and why?
[15:43:58] <pifantastic> alasdair64220: $("input[type=checkbox]").attr("checked", "checked");
[15:45:10] <nickadeemus2002> or  $('#checkbox-id').is(':checked');
[15:45:34] <alasdair64220> and the same for disabling/enabling a checkbox?  e.g.
[15:45:36] <alasdair64220> $("input").attr("disabled", false); (to re-enable)

[15:47:47] <velts> if i am using a webservice not on my domain is there a way to make an ajax call from my localhost?
[15:48:19] <versatiletech> I'm trying to figure out how to override the search function of autocomplete since I'm using a combobox UI widget factory that depends on autocomplete. I passed in a search function into the autocomplete options as here http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/. This works only AFTER running the original search function. The problem is that I need to change a part of the original search function and I don't want to mess with jquery UI source code, ju
[15:48:19] <versatiletech> in case there's an upgrade that fixes a bug and then it wipes out all the changes I made.
[15:48:27] <velts> i would need to send authentication cookies in the request
[15:48:42] <versatiletech> nickadeemus2002: that doesn't check a checkbox, it only checks if it's checked
[15:48:55] <versatiletech> that's a lot of checks O.o
[15:49:21] <nickadeemus2002> ah. misread his request.  you are correct
[15:51:51] <versatiletech> velts: JSONP might be an option http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-aj-jsonp1/
[15:52:16] <versatiletech> I'm not sure about authentication cookies

[16:10:58] <andre-h> if i want to alert "hi" when i press A, how do i do that?
[16:11:28] <andre-h> and can i do it without jquery
[16:11:55] <_zoggy_> onkeypress
[16:12:00] <_zoggy_> yes, just basic javascript

[16:13:28] <LordThumper> Hey, which jQuery UI event is fired when a Sortable list is reordered?
[16:13:52] <alasdair64220> pifantastic: thanks for your help
[16:14:00] <LordThumper> Sort event is fired continuously while moving the sortable item
[16:14:23] <_zoggy_> LordThumper, http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[16:14:31] <_zoggy_> create ?
[16:14:49] <_zoggy_> stop ?
[16:15:06] <_zoggy_> actually update looks like what you want
[16:15:15] <andre-h> _zoggy_: I dont understand that at all
[16:15:29] <LordThumper> Ok let me check that
[16:15:47] <_zoggy_> andre-h, the keypress is just an event
[16:16:03] <_zoggy_> you then need to see what keypress happened and act upon that
[16:16:19] <_zoggy_> if you want a more abstract user friendly version, then use a jquery plugin that handles all the logic
[16:16:37] <andre-h> how do i make it do something on a specific key
[16:16:57] <LordThumper> Yeah think that's what i want :) Thanks alot
[16:16:59] <andre-h> how do i do it in any way?
[16:17:16] <LordThumper> It seems to be even firing two events if i move from one sortable list to another, just what i want
[16:17:20] <lrvick> Anyone have any idea why $.bind('click') does not work when an element is removed from the dom then put back again? http://jsfiddle.net/L679L/21/
[16:18:16] <andre-h> you can't link tutorials I cant understand them i havent slept for two days
[16:18:22] <lrvick> I am creating LI elements then putting them in a var. Then I $.each through them to put them in the DOM, then destroy them from the DOM, then put them back in the DOM a second time
[16:18:34] <lrvick> on the second time, the $.bind('click') is gone
[16:18:41] <lrvick> even though nothhing removed it
[16:18:47] <lrvick> so im really confused
[16:19:33] <LordThumper> $.bind binds to the element in the DOM during the execution of the commond I think
[16:20:04] <LordThumper> Try $(element).live('click', function () { } )
[16:20:29] <LordThumper> command*
[16:20:50] <lrvick> i thought live was deprecated?
[16:21:37] <_zoggy_> live is going to be. use on
[16:21:51] <LordThumper> No actually it is a new function
[16:21:53] <_zoggy_> ? .on
[16:22:07] <LordThumper> Oh nvm I was wrong
[16:23:52] <versatiletech> ha! I figured out how to do it. For anyone that ever needs to override a method in a jquery UI widget (including custom ones like combobox) and perhaps in other plugins as well without touching the plugin's source code you can do the following $('.selector-to-widget').data('the-widget-name' ).functionIWantToOveride = function( use, same, parameters, here ) { // my code here }
[16:24:31] <lrvick> http://jsfiddle.net/L679L/26/ $.on has the same problem
[16:24:33] <lrvick> :-(
[16:24:36] <lrvick> only works once

[16:48:41] <Funksmaname> http://jsfiddle.net/Funksmaname/74RS9/  how do I set up the position BEFORE showing the caption? once you hover once its right from then on ;9
[16:48:43] <Funksmaname> :(
[16:49:33] <Funksmaname> i had to put the var and css inside the slideDown function - which is too late, but before that the result is 1 until it's not hidden anymore :S confused
[16:50:00] <LordThumper> Ok this is driving me crazy
[16:51:08] <LordThumper> Is there a Sortable event that fires only when a Sortable list is sorted? ( that is the order changed )
[16:51:38] <LordThumper> Update is firing when a Sortable list is sorted, and a list item is dragged from one Sortable list to another
[16:55:14] <nicholasschulz> Hey. I need some inputs / comments on my newly designed main banner (the one with the bike). Any area of improvements? Pros and cons are appreciated :-)  Check it out: http://annenetasje.com/area21/testdrive.php
[16:57:37] <chee> i need to ask an off-topic question to some web developers who have worked from home or who have kept their own timesheets before, where would be a good place to do that
[16:58:02] <chee> i realise that what i have just asked is already one such question.
[17:03:46] <`korvin> is the recommended way to clear a textbox: $('textbox').val(''); ?
[17:05:33] <nicholasschulz> that works fine korvin
[17:06:32] <abjorn> imsky: Who has two thumbs and is getting promoted to developer? This guy.
[17:06:42] <imsky> awww shit son
[17:06:47] <imsky> congratulations 2 u
[17:08:02] <abjorn> thanks brah, unfortunately I don't start for a month
[17:08:13] <abjorn> they have to put a hold on it until the current chattech training classes are ready
[17:08:16] <abjorn> cause they need chattechs
[17:08:19] <imsky> lol
[17:08:23] <imsky> just put cleverbot in there
[17:08:26] <imsky> he'll take care of em
[17:08:28] <abjorn> which, considering how HELLISHLY BUSY it has been this week, makes a whole lot of sense
[17:08:52] <abjorn> pls, cleverbot will call them persons-of-the-african-american-variety
[17:09:00] <abjorn> I know because I've seent it
[17:09:20] <abjorn> http://gigaom.com/2012/01/05/node-summit-giving-node-js-the-business-treatment/ I liked node.js before it was cool.
[17:09:33] <imsky> hmm
[17:09:56] <imsky> i think i've only now, in the last 1-1.5 years, seen widespread commodity RoR support
[17:10:04] <imsky> how long will it take for node to become a commodity?
[17:10:12] <rknLA> hey, so i'm dynamically creating some anchors of a certain class and trying to bind a function to the click event of all of them.  is there a more efficient way to do this than unbinding all of the old $('.foo')s before $('.foo').click(somefunction) ?
[17:10:13] <hipsterjorn> 0.2 seconds from now
[17:10:14] <hipsterjorn> done
[17:10:27] <imsky> yeah about that
[17:10:30] <hipsterjorn> tbh idk why it's adopted so god damn quickly. it makes no sense to me
[17:10:38] <imsky> someone's pushing it commercially
[17:10:40] <imsky> same as rails
[17:10:53] <imsky> i dunno enough about the node community, i'm just assuming it's joyent
[17:10:56] <hipsterjorn> you can say the same about a lot of (failed) platforms
[17:11:03] <hipsterjorn> course those are usually pushed by microsoft, but you know
[17:11:05] <imsky> java's still around
[17:11:11] <imsky> php's probably the only one that's grassroots
[17:11:15] <imsky> even then...zend
[17:11:21] <hipsterjorn> psh zend doesn't count
[17:11:41] <imsky> i dunno, what do you think senor hipsterjorn
[17:11:45] <imsky> is node ready for everybody
[17:11:54] <imsky> considering the kind of dipshit questions you get in #jquery
[17:13:13] <hipsterjorn> dunno
[17:13:45] <railbait> Hello. I'm using a datepicker and wrote some logic in the beforeShowDay event that I'd like to fire off again when onChangeMonthYear. Basically I'd like to re-run the beforeShowDay code to apply styles to the dates.
[17:13:55] <hipsterjorn> considering I saw someone in #node.js talk about how globals were cool, I'm pretty sure node suffers from a case of jquery syndrome
[17:13:58] <railbait> Is there a good way to do that or a different approach i should take?
[17:16:55] <streblo> is there a reason why $.ajax will fire an error callback even if the server returns a 200
[17:18:29] <railbait> My bad, looks like it actually was executing
[17:18:38] <railbait> I think I had another error that was interrupting that method from running
[17:18:59] <railbait> life'shardbra
[17:22:25] <streblo> anyone?
[17:22:51] <streblo> response is 200 and the minmetype is application/json and the dataType for the request is json
[17:23:06] <streblo> the error callback is still being called
[17:23:25] <versatiletech> streblo: I think I've had that happen before but I can't remember what it was
[17:25:00] <versatiletech> streblo: there's three parameters given to the error function in $.ajax. You MIGHT be able to get your answer in one of those parameters.
[17:26:26] <abjorn> imsky: I like how not even 10 minutes after I was told I'm getting the dev position at work I get an email about a javascript programmer position in austin working for evernote.
[17:27:49] <imsky> abjorn: you'll see that pattern a lot in life
[17:27:58] <imsky> as soon as you have something, something else pops up
[17:28:08] <imsky> NEVER HAPPY
[17:28:56] <imsky> abjorn: i'm looking through old sql dumps right now. back in the day ('08, '09) i was writing about serverside javascript...it was more like a "wouldn't it be nice" thing
[17:29:18] <abjorn> rofl
[17:29:41] <imsky> wondering what the hell i was talking about
[17:30:44] <imsky> there were a couple of packages available back then
[17:30:47] <imsky> man
[17:31:27] <imsky> true story: http://almaer.com/blog/2008-year-of-server-side-javascript
[17:32:22] <imsky> right, there it is: http://jsext.sourceforge.net/
[17:32:30] <imsky> that was what really got me excited
[17:32:56] <imsky> check it out btw http://web.archive.org/web/20090107062334/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_JavaScript @ abjorn
[17:32:59] <versatiletech> uggghhh. The agony of having to deal with IE's "slow-as-molasses" javascript engine. >:(
[17:33:28] <nicholasschulz> Okay; something is wrong here… when i click the "buy" or "sell" they start jumping in FF. Take a look. http://annenetasje.com/area21/testdrive.php Any ideas on a fix?
[17:33:42] <nicholasschulz> Works fine in Chrome
[17:33:48] <nicholasschulz> and safari
[17:44:13] <railbait> Is there a way on a datepicker to determine the currently displayed month? You get "getDate", but if the user uses the prev/next buttons then that's off
[17:44:32] <railbait> I've considered tracking the left/right offset with the event that's triggered with prev/next but would prefer to not
[17:47:48] <cuppsy> Am I crazy, or is some special voodoo required to set the top/right on an absolutely position image?
[17:52:18] <LordThumper> Why is checking a checkbox through jQuery (Using $(element).prop("checked", true)) not firing 'change' event?
[17:52:52] <cuppsy> Nevermind, ignore that question. I'm a Grade-A moron.
[17:57:25] <Chib> LordThumper: For select boxes, checkboxes, and radio buttons, the event is fired immediately when the user makes a selection with the mouse, but for the other element types the event is deferred until the element loses focus.
[17:57:35] <Chib> that's what triggers change
[17:58:10] <nicholasschulz> Take a look at this in Firefox please: http://annenetasje.com/area21/testdrive.php When you click a link, the buttons start to move / jump…. ? whats that all about? works fine in chrome and safari
[18:00:10] <LordThumper> Chib I see, I am currently firing the 'change' event using .changed()
[18:00:23] <Eviltwin> changed()?
[18:00:48] <LordThumper> Sorry .change()
[18:02:38] <LordThumper> Eviltwin do you think that it is possible to do something like $(element).is('li:last-child > :checked')
[18:02:53] <LordThumper> The last list item that has a checked checkbox
[18:03:45] <Eviltwin> Where element is the OL/UL or above?
[18:04:03] <Eviltwin> Or you're trying to test if something is the last one that's checked
[18:04:20] <LordThumper> <ul><li><checkbox/></li><li><checkbox/></li></ul>
[18:04:50] <LordThumper> Yeah exactly, last checkbox in a li that is checked
[18:05:01] <LordThumper> in a ul *
[18:05:18] <Eviltwin> And what is "element"?
[18:05:28] <LordThumper> But the checkbox are not direct children of the ul, they are children of the li
[18:05:34] <LordThumper> li
[18:05:40] <brokenflipside> what is a good .live() alternative?
[18:06:08] <Eviltwin> brokenflipside: .delegate or .on
[18:07:18] <LordThumper> Ok I cleared it in my mind
[18:07:20] <thepro4ever> my $.ajax({ }); doesn't appear to be getting called i don't know what the hec is wrong with it and i've been racking my brain, http://codepad.org/Q42xF7AC
[18:07:32] <LordThumper> I just need to know if the checkbox is the last checked checkbox in an ul
[18:07:56] <streblo> Anyone know why $.ajax would fire the error callback if the response is a 200?
[18:08:11] <Eviltwin> LordThumper: You can use li:has(input[type=checkbox]:checked):last to get the one that is the last LI that's checked
[18:08:21] <Eviltwin> So you can .is it by doing this: http://jsfiddle.net/ePRQ5/
[18:08:28] <LordThumper> Awesome thanks Eviltwin :)
[18:08:35] <Eviltwin> Keep in mind that there are non-CSS3 selectors involved there
[18:08:47] <Eviltwin> So it can be slow if there are a lot of lis/checkboxes
[18:08:55] <thepro4ever> sorry here is the whole thing, can someone tell me what i did wrong, http://codepad.org/XI7VOBsG , when i do a check on the string being returned from the function it has value "NOTHING"
[18:09:25] <Eviltwin> thepro4ever: $.ajax is an asyncronous function
[18:09:50] <thepro4ever> Eviltwin: and I'm a stupid person
[18:09:58] <Eviltwin> Here's an example of a synchronous and an asynchronous function: http://jsfiddle.net/uYeYN/1/
[18:10:02] <thepro4ever> Eviltwin: can you tell me what that means
[18:10:14] <Eviltwin> Where the letters represent the order the code runs in
[18:10:21] <Eviltwin> Look at the two and compare
[18:12:59] <thepro4ever> so basically because it's asynchronous i won't know which part of the function executes first?
[18:13:27] <Eviltwin> No, you'll know that the code right after the $.ajax call runs before the success function
[18:14:15] <Eviltwin> You need to use a callback if you want your pass back data
[18:22:37] <thepro4ever> ok i think i have a better grasp, because it's asynchronous it's got some kind of timer/delay associated with it, so the code execution skips to the next line which is the end of my function to "return myString;"
[18:22:50] <thepro4ever> so it always returns "NOTHING"
[18:26:58] <thepro4ever> i have updated my ajax call with callbacks for the test and it still fails to give me an alert pop up, http://codepad.org/ViW9NhHL
[18:27:02] <sphinxxx> i have a problem where if i append <li> to a <ul> after the page has loaded, theres not the proper styling
[18:27:06] <sphinxxx> this is with jquery mobile lists
[18:30:08] <Eviltwin> thepro4ever: http://codepad.org/QZuqCVwa
[18:30:54] <thepro4ever> yeah i saw that i forgot to pull callback as an argument
[18:31:16] <thepro4ever> but i didn't try passing the string to another function
[18:35:39] <lessthanzero> I'm building a query that listens to the window hash, and working on the "back" functionality now. When I click back (and I log in the hash change event handler) I see my complete history in hash changes, which causes some havoc in my animations - any ideas?
[18:37:01] <lessthanzero> it's a simple enough callback that simple logs the current hash.
[18:46:26] <whoever> need some help i am tring to get the value of a combo box onchange but my alerts come up "undefined" or blank i have tried alert($(this).val()) , alert($("#soft_opt option:selected").val()) .  can someone assist
[18:50:02] <Jbud> Hey whoever
[18:50:13] <Jbud> You should switch to console.log()
[18:50:21] <innociv__> I'm having issues with using tinymce with my code.  Tinymce doesn't load synchronous, so if I try to call a command on it right after the command to load it, it say the tinymce doesn't exist.  Is there some sort of .. do {} when(loaded()) type thing? :/
[18:50:27] <Jbud> Much more powerful than alert() :D
[18:51:34] <lessthanzero> lol
[18:51:44] <lessthanzero> @alert
[18:52:35] <whoever> Jbud: console.log() ?
[18:52:48] <Jbud> Yep
[18:52:56] <Jbud> console.log($("#soft_opt option:selected").val())
[18:52:57] <Jbud> But
[18:53:13] <Jbud> Is the class on your combobox  soft_opt   ??
[18:53:38] <whoever> Jbud: its the id of soft_opt
[18:53:54] <Jbud> Id right
[18:54:26] <Jbud> :selected should work if I remember right
[18:54:33] <Jbud> oh but
[18:54:41] <Jbud> It might be .text() that you want off of it?
[18:55:01] <Jbud> Why don't you do a console.log($("#soft_opt option:selected"))  and see what comes up?
[18:55:33] <whoever> Jbud: i use.tet() i get the string that i have before my combox box, i wast the selected value as the user sees it
[18:56:02] <whoever> Jbud: where will console.log go ie output
[18:56:20] <Jbud> Try the console.log out
[18:56:28] <Jbud> You can searh the object directly from your console
[18:56:31] <Jbud> Oh
[18:56:34] <Jbud> I don't use IE tbh
[18:56:58] <Jbud> Chrome, Opera, Firefox and Safari have great functionality with the console
[18:57:06] <Jbud> But I think IE9+ has the developer tools that you can use
[19:00:34] <Gao> how do i get the first li in an ol
[19:01:23] <Gao> well how do i get all of them, but ordered
[19:01:42] <Eviltwin> $("ol li") is every li in every ol in document order
[19:01:59] <Gao> how do i count how many there are?
[19:02:06] <Eviltwin> $("#foo li") is every li inside the element with ID "foo"
[19:02:10] <Eviltwin> .length on the end
[19:02:15] <Eviltwin> $("ol li").length
[19:03:46] <Gao> can i do $("#foo ol li") ?
[19:04:02] <whoever> Jbud: i may have just figured it out
[19:04:07] <Eviltwin> That's every li in every ol inside the element with id "foo"
[19:04:24] <Jbud> whoever: thats great! :D
[19:05:05] <Gao> would it be faster to just do "#foo li" than "#foo ol li"?
[19:05:23] <tomato> right: get_the_post_thumbnail( $post->ID, 'post-thumbnail')  clearly has some special behaviour...
[19:05:47] <tomato> it stretches small images to fit the dimensions
[19:06:01] <tomato> oops wrong room sorry
[19:07:53] <Funksmaname> before an element is hidden (its the first thing in my script) it shows for a split second in IE and then dissapears - any way to fix that?
[19:08:38] <Eviltwin> Hide it with inline style="" or CSS instead of JavaScript
[19:08:39] <Gao> yes change it's css to display:none
[19:08:50] <Eviltwin> ?g FOUC @ Funksmaname
[19:08:52] <bot-t> Funksmaname, Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC) - http://bluerobot.com/web/css/fouc.asp/
[19:09:00] <Funksmaname> but i want it to show if theres no JX
[19:09:03] <Funksmaname> JS
[19:09:05] <Funksmaname> sorry
[19:09:10] <Gao> use noscript
[19:09:12] <Eviltwin> Then you're SOL
[19:09:33] <Funksmaname> thanks :P
[19:09:51] <whoever> Jbud: check pn
[19:09:54] <whoever> pm
[19:10:42] <Funksmaname> maybe its a side effect of jsfiddle/draft
[19:10:53] <Funksmaname> i'll tackle it when I actually build the page
[19:11:17] <marclemagne> does anybody know the best way to setup a file full of templates as scripts to be included on every page but (hopefully) cached by the browser so they don't get reloaded every page load?
[19:11:57] <Gao> so is $ in jquery a function?
[19:12:20] <Eviltwin> Yes, $ is a function
[19:12:39] <Gao> that's pretty cool i was always wondering what it was lol
[19:13:07] <Eviltwin> If you can call it, it's a function
[19:17:36] <Gao> how do i check if #foo ol li exists?
[19:17:50] <bartmax> check for length property
[19:17:53] <Eviltwin> $("#foo ol li").length == 0
[19:18:02] <bartmax> actually, $("#foo ol li").length === 0
[19:18:14] <Gao> ok
[19:18:17] <Eviltwin> It's less than half a nanosecond different
[19:18:18] <Eviltwin> :P
[19:18:33] <Gao> which one is faster?
[19:18:37] <Eviltwin> But you actually want $("#foo ol li").length > 0
[19:18:43] <bartmax> you should always avoid == and user ===
[19:18:45] <Eviltwin> If you want to test if it exists
[19:18:46] <bartmax> user = use
[19:18:54] <Eviltwin> bartmax: You know they mean different things, right?
[19:19:04] <bartmax> Eviltwin: yes
[19:22:26] <blahface> hi, where can I find the changelog for jquery? the jquery ui has a nice layout for its changle log at http://jqueryui.com/docs/Changelog is there a similar thing for jquery?
[19:23:26] <joshsmith> if I'm running validation on a form
[19:23:40] <joshsmith> how can I prevent submission and then trigger it?
[19:24:01] <joshsmith> I'm guessing that e.preventDefault and then trigger('submit') won't work
[19:24:58] <bartmax> joshsmith: $('form').submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[19:25:13] <bartmax> function doSubmit() { $('form').submit(); }
[19:25:29] <bartmax> joshsmith: you can also do return false
[19:25:40] <Eviltwin> blahface: Not exactly
[19:25:46] <joshsmith> can I trigger that submission after that e.preventDefault though, within the same scope bartmax
[19:25:46] <Eviltwin> There's this: http://blog.jquery.com/2011/11/03/jquery-1-7-released/
[19:25:53] <bartmax> joshsmith: sure.
[19:26:04] <joshsmith> I feel like I'd tried that before and it didn't work
[19:26:05] <bartmax> joshsmith: why u need to preventdefault then ?
[19:26:07] <joshsmith> let me retry here
[19:26:13] <joshsmith> bartmax: for custom validation
[19:26:23] <bartmax> so you can :
[19:26:49] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: Take a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/h54dd/
[19:26:59] <bartmax> $('form').submit(function() { // you code bla bla ... if(!validate){return false;} }
[19:27:17] <bartmax> reutrn false will prevent submition
[19:28:04] <joshsmith> this is creating an infinite loop it seems
[19:28:23] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: Look closely
[19:28:32] <joshsmith> what I'm doing
[19:28:34] <joshsmith> looking at yours now
[19:28:50] <Eviltwin> K
[19:29:06] <bartmax> if you submit inside a submit, you will have a loop yes
[19:29:25] <Eviltwin> bartmax: Not necessarily
[19:30:34] <Gao> it's not working >.> 	var sel = 'div#recentManga ol li:' + i;
[19:30:34] <Gao> 	alert($(sel).length);
[19:30:56] <Eviltwin> Is "i" a number
[19:31:10] <bartmax> li:3 ?
[19:31:14] <Gao> yeh
[19:31:17] <Gao> Error thrown at line 3, column 29304 in <anonymous function: m.error>(a) in https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js:
[19:31:17] <Gao>     throw new Error("Syntax error, unrecognized expression: "+a)
[19:31:19] <Eviltwin> That's not a valid selector
[19:31:23] <bartmax> didn't know that works
[19:31:33] <Gao> why not Eviltwin?
[19:31:34] <Eviltwin> What are yoy trying to do
[19:31:37] <Eviltwin> bartmax: It doens't work
[19:31:47] <Eviltwin> Gao: 'Cause it's not
[19:32:09] <Eviltwin> Gao: You're looking for "li:eq("+i+")"
[19:32:24] <Gao> i wanna get the first li
[19:32:25] <keybo> what is the hostname of my database server if i'm installing something to xampp locally, can anyone help me please?
[19:32:27] <Gao> and then the second onee
[19:32:44] <Eviltwin> Gao: http://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/
[19:33:08] <Eviltwin> keybo: How does that have ANYTHING to do with jQuery?
[19:33:38] <bartmax> i need someone with a valid us credit card to do me a favor. (no, it doesn't involve telling me any card information or spend money anywhere) ... i know it's akward but im desperate ;) i takes just 10 seconds... if anyone is willing to help, let me know. It's to subscribe to itunes match service.
[19:33:45] <keybo> Erm, where does it say all chat must expressly be related to jQuery?
[19:33:59] <Gao> ...
[19:34:08] <Eviltwin> keybo: In the name of the channel :P
[19:34:09] <bartmax> talking about jquery unrelated chats :)
[19:35:30] <keybo> you guys are generally very savvy people when it comes to this kind of thing, i'm making the safe assumption that at least afew people in here know about more things than just jQuery, despite the channel in which they are currently present :P
[19:35:54] <Eviltwin> We try to avoid off-topic noise
[19:36:29] <keybo> I don't think you speak for the room on that one, I've had some quite interesting off-topic chats in here on previous occassions :P
[19:37:11] <ajpiano> keybo: that rationale could be applied to almost every irc channel with a specific subject - however, it's equally unreasonable everywhere :)
[19:37:31] <ajpiano> keybo: a little bit of organic offtopic hapepning here and there is different than just asking how to configure unrelated stuff
[19:37:36] <keybo> anyway, cutting out the off-topic noise, can anyone help me with my problem?
[19:37:39] <ajpiano> because "hey it's computers!"
[19:37:40] <Gao> it's still giving me crap: var sel = 'div#recentManga ol li:eq(' + i + ')';
[19:37:40] <Gao> 	
[19:39:01] <ngharo> keybo: localhost
[19:39:10] <ngharo> gee that was a lot easier than flaming him :P
[19:39:17] <keybo> thanks ngharo :)
[19:39:26] <Gao> div#recentManga ol li:eq(1) <--- what's wrong with this
[19:41:38] <Funksmaname> can you prevent the default action for one click and then bring it back?
[19:41:38] <Gao> it's giving me an error
[19:42:18] <Gao> funks try storing it in a variable
[19:43:42] <Funksmaname> gao, is your thing not working due to index starting at 0? just a n00by guess
[19:44:31] <Gao> ah i found the error lol, it wasnt that
[19:48:00] <thepro4ever> this is crazy, my ajax call is calling my servlet which does an insert to the database once it's called and thats working but for somereason xhr.status is giving me an error code of 0
[19:48:16] <thepro4ever> i have no idea what to do for this because i'm new to web development
[19:58:11] <Gao> is there a way to store an array of strings in a cookie as an array? XD
[19:59:33] <ajpiano> Gao:  you can store it as a string and just translate it back and forth into an array using array join and split
[20:00:19] <Gao> yeh that's what i'm doing but how do i delimit each string without using a character that isn't in one of the strings? XD
[20:00:34] <Gao> ooh
[20:00:43] <Gao> can i use "\n"
[20:06:25] <Gao> sweet there are cookie arrays XD
[20:14:10] <deweydb> with jQuery-UI sortable is there a clean way to get the number of positions shifted in a list after the drop complete?
[20:15:16] <deweydb> i see that it returns ui.position.top but this variable seems to reflect how far the user moved the item, as apposed to the final position of the sorted item
[20:15:43] <kenperkins> has anyone ever heard of gziping data on the client before sending to the server with jquery
[20:17:34] <deweydb> ahhh ui.item.index()
[20:17:36] <deweydb> nevermind
[20:18:13] <deweydb> kenperkins: no, but that sounds pretty awesome.
[20:18:30] <deweydb> is that just for speed optimization?
[20:18:30] <kenperkins> well, I don't want to have to write it ;)
[20:18:39] <kenperkins> yea, we can send some pretty large payloads to the server
[20:18:50] <deweydb> what is the application?
[20:18:55] <kenperkins> so the performance diff between 50k and 5k (on a crappy connect) can be extreme
[20:19:14] <kenperkins> sending text to a server
[20:19:49] <deweydb> it seems pretty simple though TBH. just find a javascript function for Gzip
[20:21:58] <Guddu> Hi All...If you go to https://demo.phppointofsale.com and then login and then select items and then press on "Add new Item" then a new modal windows opens to enter details of the new item. Could someone please help me in understanding how this modal window works?
[20:22:08] <Guddu> Please
[20:27:34] <dr0id> I guess that's a question for Google.com ?
[20:29:01] <Hexasquid> Having a look
[20:29:17] <Hexasquid> What is your objective? Another modal window?
[20:29:27] <Hexasquid> Did you make this site?
[20:29:46] <Guddu> Hexasquid, I want to understand how this works. I would like to build something similar for my Web Application
[20:29:47] <Hexasquid> Or have you inheritied it?
[20:30:10] <Hexasquid> Ok... do you want to make your own or are you interested in using a plugin?
[20:30:30] <dr0id> I want to make my own, guide me
[20:31:06] <Guddu> Hexasquid, Thanks for helping out on this. I am just curious as to how this works. I am ok with making my own or using a goood plugin if it already exists........My end goal is to be able to show this form etc and use it in my Django powered application.
[20:31:50] <Guddu> I saw the source but I could not find any place where they button's submit action is happening and modal form launching etc etc. Totally confused regarding how it works.
[20:32:41] <Hexasquid> Hmm I want to direct you here: http://www.ericmmartin.com/projects/simplemodal/ which is a failry reliable off the shelf modal plugin.
[20:32:43] <Gao> how do i create a new li in an ol
[20:33:33] <Guddu> Thanks Hexasquid ....I saw that one too....I will be exploring that as welll.
[20:33:40] <Hexasquid> I really depends what you want to do. If I'm making a modal and i know it only has to do a few simple things I might make my own, otherwise I'd grab something like this where it's really quick to implement and it has a number of features
[20:34:36] <Hexasquid> $('ol').append('<li>') might do the trick
[20:34:48] <Hexasquid> Unless there is more than one ol
[20:34:55] <Hexasquid> Then you'll need to be more selective
[20:35:42] <Guddu> Hexasquid, However, I was intrigued how are they doing it in the website that i sent. Are they using javascript or jquery? And where is the action defined for clicking of the add buttton. Could not find anything relate din the source.
[20:36:05] <Hexasquid> Ok i'll take a look
[20:37:06] <Guddu> Thank Hexasquid The buttton has a link as https://demo.phppointofsale.com/index.php/items/view/-1/width~550 not sure how that leads to opening of modal form.
[20:40:45] <Hexasquid> thinkbox.js line 20
[20:40:52] <Hexasquid> thincbox.js line 20
[20:40:55] <Guddu> Hexasquid, Checking
[20:40:57] <Hexasquid> thickbox.js line 20
[20:41:00] <Hexasquid> woop
[20:42:14] <Guddu> Hexasquid, How did you figure this out? Could u please help me undesratnding the approach
[20:42:46] <Hexasquid> The <a> has a class of thickbox, when the document loads it is assigned a click handler that passes info about the <a> to another function
[20:43:06] <Hexasquid> Ok so I used the chrome inspector to examine the modal
[20:43:37] <Hexasquid> It has ids like TD_overlay, TD_window etc
[20:44:11] <Hexasquid> I noticed that there was a script called thickbox .. TB (oops, should have written TB above)
[20:44:19] <Hexasquid> So I started looking in there
[20:44:31] <Hexasquid> Also examined the <a> element for clues
[20:44:39] <Hexasquid> I has a class of thickbox
[20:45:27] <Hexasquid> In the tickbox scrit I searched for TB_overlay ... that was in a function identified as tb_show, guess it 'shows' thickboxes
[20:46:14] <Hexasquid> that's called by a function tb_init  which receives a paramenter domChunk ... ok, a reference to something in the DOM I guess
[20:47:07] <Hexasquid> aha, tb_init is called at document ready and passed a bunch of things including a.thickbox
[20:48:40] <Guddu> Hexasquid, It's making little more sense now to me :)
[20:48:53] <Hexasquid> So it looks like that thickbox thing will show a modal when you click on a 'a' with a class of '.thickbox'
[20:49:13] <Guddu> a.thickbox translates to a elemenet <a> which has a class thickbox right?
[20:49:31] <Hexasquid> Looks like it
[20:50:19] <Guddu> Hexasquid, One more...Where do the form fields come from?
[20:50:50] <Hexasquid> It also has an element in the modal called ajaxContent, I'm guessing the href attribute of the 'a' elem is used to provide a path to something that produced the form
[20:51:19] <Hexasquid> https://demo.phppointofsale.com/index.php/items/view/-1/width~550
[20:51:24] <Hexasquid> There
[20:51:29] <Hexasquid> No styling of course
[20:53:03] <Hexasquid> That's URL is the value of the href in the 'a' you click on. Its another page that spits out a form. Thickbox calls the page and puts the content in a nice modal box.
[20:55:30] <Guddu> Hexasquid, Thanks....It makes more sense now. Thanks for guiding my analysis.
[20:55:45] <Hexasquid> Anything else?
[20:56:50] <Guddu> Hexasquid, will wget be able to get the file used in https://demo.phppointofsale.com/index.php/items/view/-1/width~550?
[20:57:46] <Hexasquid> Errrr
[20:57:56] <Hexasquid> I'm not too familiar with wget
[20:58:02] <Hexasquid> Exactly what are you trying to do
[20:58:13] <Hexasquid> ?
[20:58:34] <Hexasquid> If it can retrieve content from a URL yes
[20:58:51] <Guddu> Hexasquid, I will get the file to experiemnt a little on my local machine
[20:58:54] <Hexasquid> Just like we can with our browser by dumpingthat url in the address bar
[20:59:16] <Hexasquid> It's not so much the file as it is the output of the server serving that file
[20:59:58] <Hexasquid> So you request the resource at the address -  the server will do a bunch of jazz and return the form
[21:00:36] <Hexasquid> But I'm not the right person to ask about wget
[21:00:45] <Hexasquid> What is our relationship to this site?
[21:00:50] <Hexasquid> *your
[21:01:12] <Guddu> Hexasquid, No relation. I just liked the way they have designed the site. I am working on a Django based application.
[21:01:20] <Hexasquid> Ok :)
[21:01:40] <Guddu> I am good at Django but anything that has to do with front end design bogs me down :( I understand little of Javascripts, JQuery, Ajax etc
[21:01:56] <Guddu> I don't even know which one of these are being used on this site....i guess all of them....
[21:02:05] <Hexasquid> All
[21:02:07] <Guddu> I see jquery and jquer.form includes though
[21:02:18] <Hexasquid> JQuery is just a javascript library
[21:02:48] <Hexasquid> And ajax is a means to make asynch requests with javascript
[21:03:03] <Guddu> Django has a template based system which generates HTML for the browser.
[21:04:18] <Guddu> If i decide to model my application ina  similar fashion then my template should generate a form which then would be thrown into the modal...Need to figue out how to do that now :)
[21:04:32] <Guddu> Thanks for the help and time you spent with me.
[21:04:44] <Hexasquid> No problem and good luck!
[21:05:03] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: never thanked you for that form help
[21:05:05] <Hexasquid> Ha to me the python would be the hard part
[21:05:42] <Guddu> Hexasquid, You good at designing apps as these i guess. with CSS etc
[21:06:05] <Hexasquid> That is how I make a living
[21:06:19] <joshsmith> Hexasquid: right on, brotha
[21:06:47] <Guddu> Hexasquid, If i need your consulting for my app how could i contact you?
[21:06:57] <Hexasquid> Well maybe not design, normally there are designers and UX people who design the thing. I just do the bit between the designer and the backend team
[21:07:12] <joshsmith> then some of us work on the entire stack
[21:07:16] <joshsmith> from design to sysadmin
[21:07:28] <Hexasquid> You can't - don't need any more work thanks ;)
[21:07:41] <Hexasquid> @josh glorious
[21:07:53] <Guddu> :-)
[21:08:02] <Hexasquid> You can always come to this channel though, lots of good people
[21:08:07] <Hexasquid> also #css
[21:08:30] <Guddu> Sure. Sounds goood. There are always people who are willing to guide.
[21:08:46] <Hexasquid> if we don't work together we're all gonna die
[21:08:52] <Guddu> :)
[21:09:15] <joshsmith> I only help for the internet points
[21:09:25] <joshsmith> I don't have broad philosophical reasons for doing so
[21:09:25] <Hexasquid> They mean the most of all
[21:09:36] <joshsmith> more rep, please
[21:10:14] <Hexasquid> ++rep
[21:10:18] <joshsmith> hey Hexasquid: you do any work with regex in JS?
[21:10:48] <Hexasquid> Occasionally. (worried face)
[21:11:02] <joshsmith> I'm not sure how to wrap this:
[21:11:09] <joshsmith> https://gist.github.com/1569114
[21:11:48] <joshsmith> any ideas?
[21:12:22] <Hexasquid> Sorry page not loading, i'm having a bad internet day
[21:12:28] <Hexasquid> refresh refresh
[21:12:33] <joshsmith> github isn't loading? weird
[21:13:05] <joshsmith> do I just do a forward slash?
[21:13:21] <Hexasquid> No it's probably on my end
[21:13:39] <Hexasquid> My NAS has probably turned on it's Bitorrent
[21:13:50] <joshsmith> well I'll cp here
[21:13:51] <joshsmith> [a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*@(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?
[21:13:57] <Guddu> Ok Hexasquid ....I will leave now. Thanks again for your help. Good Night
[21:14:30] <Hexasquid> No problem
[21:14:49] <Hexasquid> @josh woah
[21:15:18] <Hexasquid> what does that do?
[21:15:34] <Hexasquid> or what should it do?
[21:16:14] <joshsmith> oh, should I simply wrap in quotes?
[21:16:54] <joshsmith> no, that doesn't work
[21:17:07] <Hexasquid> That would make it a strong
[21:17:09] <Hexasquid> string
[21:17:14] <joshsmith> Hexasquid: it validates whether an email conforms to RFC 2822
[21:17:30] <Hexasquid> one moment
[21:17:36] <joshsmith> I'm not at all sure how to wrap regex properly
[21:20:52] <Hexasquid> @josh:   /[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*@(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?/.test('a@email.com');
[21:21:06] <Hexasquid> wrap in '/'s
[21:21:36] <Hexasquid> and use /yourregex/.test('the@email.com')
[21:22:01] <Hexasquid> try in in the chrome javascript console
[21:22:02] <joshsmith> Hexasquid: huh. that's what I had done and I thought it wouldn't work
[21:22:11] <joshsmith> because my texteditor is whack
[21:22:11] <Hexasquid> seems to wokr for me
[21:22:15] <joshsmith> yeah, it works
[21:22:18] <Hexasquid> rad
[21:22:25] <joshsmith> but now my editor doesn't render the rest of my JS correctly
[21:22:38] <joshsmith> syntax highlighting is all messed up
[21:22:39] <Hexasquid> what editor
[21:22:42] <joshsmith> TextMate
[21:22:53] <Hexasquid> Hmm how odd
[21:22:55] <ngharo> probably because there are unescaped '/'s in that regex... kinda suprised it compiles without escaping them
[21:23:11] <joshsmith> ngharo: how do I escape the /'s?
[21:23:22] <joshsmith> just double slash?
[21:23:39] <ngharo> well it may break if you do... but you to make literal use a forward slash
[21:23:41] <ngharo> \/
[21:23:42] <Hexasquid> errrrr I wouldn't think so
[21:24:04] <Hexasquid> That will very likey break it or change it
[21:24:14] <ngharo> yeah, prolly
[21:24:26] <joshsmith> it's working
[21:25:53] <Hexasquid> re = new RegExp(/[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*@(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?/);
[21:26:16] <Hexasquid> Maybe textmate would prefer it like that with parens around it?
[21:26:31] <Hexasquid> re.test('email@email.uk')
[21:27:23] <joshsmith> isn't declaring with new generally a bad practice?
[21:29:23] <Hexasquid> I don't know. I normally would just use the  literal anyway. I'm looking for a way it'll not mess up in your editor ;)
[21:29:40] <joshsmith> Hexasquid: nope, it chokes on the use of new, too
[21:29:55] <Hexasquid> Oh well, go with plan A then
[21:30:13] <Hexasquid> Curious about why declaring with new would be bad
[21:31:57] <joshsmith> using the built-in constructors are anti-patterns for several reasons
[21:32:05] <joshsmith> the book JS Patterns discusses it in detail
[21:32:20] <joshsmith> (and I can't remember the why clearly enough, just that I should always use literals)
[21:35:14] <joshsmith> thanks for your help Hexasquid and ngharo; heading to bed
[21:35:38] <Hexasquid> No problem good luck
[21:37:00] <ryanseddon> The regexp constructor does have the advantage of being able to create one base on user input
[21:40:10] <freedrull> my question is...........does background-color work with .animate?
[21:46:36] <freedrull> some people say you need jquery ui, some people say you need color plugin...
[21:52:57] <ngharo> color plugin iirc
[21:57:10] <freedrull> probably both
[23:08:38] <geraldyeong> Hi Everyone !
[23:08:45] <geraldyeong> wow its 7 am
[23:08:46] <geraldyeong> LoL
[23:10:28] <geraldyeong> wow its been such a long time since i've used IRC
[23:11:03] <sente> 2am here :)
[23:11:55] <geraldyeong> haha its 3 pm over here
[23:12:03] <geraldyeong> from the status sent ?
[23:12:06] <geraldyeong> sente* ?
[23:15:32] <sente> gernatech: you've done confused me
[23:15:42] <gernatech> oh
[23:15:43] <gernatech> sorry
[23:15:44] <gernatech> LoL !
[23:15:50] <gernatech> mac lion auto correct is really ridiculous
[23:15:55] <gernatech> auto corrects everything !
[23:16:07] <sente> damn macs
[23:16:13] <sente> so are you in australia?
[23:16:15] <gernatech> what i wanted to ask was, you from the states ?
[23:16:19] <gernatech> I'm over at singapore
[23:16:25] <sente> ahh, that makes more sense
[23:16:29] <gernatech> lmao.
[23:16:58] <sente> i thought you were talking about some IRC status that said it was 7am or something..
[23:17:02] <gernatech> Lmao
[23:17:03] <gernatech> nahh
[23:17:08] <sente> yeah, Boston, on the east coast
[23:17:13] <gernatech> nice boston
[23:17:19] <gernatech> i got a friend studying in boston now
[23:17:27] <gernatech> berkley music collage ?
[23:17:39] <gernatech> i would love to visit boston some day
[23:17:42] <sente> yeah, bekley school of music
[23:17:47] <sente> *berkley
[23:17:51] <sente> that's a good school
[23:19:07] <gernatech> yeah, was just talking to my friend awhile ago
[23:19:13] <gernatech> she was telling me she's on the dean's list
[23:19:32] <gernatech> i was like, "whattttt you're too cool, and you were saying there were a lot of other talented musicians"
[23:20:08] <gernatech> so Sente, you come here often ?
[23:21:57] <sente> i never leave
[23:22:01] <gernatech> omg
[23:22:02] <gernatech> LOL
[23:22:04] <gernatech> nice.
[23:22:08] <vladikoff> nice!
[23:22:24] <gernatech> I'm assuming everyone in this room is some sort of jQuery guru
[23:22:27] <gernatech> except for me
[23:22:30] <gernatech> lololol
[23:22:41] <sente> that's a bad assumption
[23:23:04] <sente> i'm certainly not a guru
[23:23:08] <gernatech> haha well I'm just fooling are
[23:23:10] <gernatech> ard*
[23:23:54] <gernatech> actually i was working on exploring wordpress,buddy press and also event press
[23:24:08] <gernatech> but i figured, #jquery should probably be on free node as well
[23:27:07] <gernatech> so what do you do sente ?
[23:28:18] <woozly> guys, how to select all inputs instead of textarea?
[23:28:32] <woozly> $('input:not(textarea)') - not working
[23:28:59] <BFranks_> I've been working with autocomplete using a JSON data source. The standard autocomplete needs me to split() the string I'm getting from JSON.parse(), but after that it works properly. When I tried to move on to the autocomplete with categories http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#categories I'm failing to get the 'data' array to split properly. (I'm array inept) :)
[23:29:59] <gernatech> woozly: what are you trying to do with selecting all inputs ?
[23:30:00] <sente> gernatech: I hack things in python for money and pleasure, more pleasure than money
[23:30:03] <vladikoff> woozly, try $("form :input:not(:textarea)");
[23:30:20] <woozly> vladikoff, thanks. ill try
[23:30:40] <gernatech> sente : wow. thats cool.
[23:30:46] <woozly> gernatech, I want to bind event listener ('keypress'), because when I push ENTER, it sends to form's action
[23:31:39] <gernatech> woozly : hmm, tricky, imo binding an event listener to all ur inputs sounds troublesome
[23:32:31] <gernatech> woozly: any luck with :input ?
[23:34:42] <gernatech> test
[23:36:00] <geoid> greetz
[23:36:01] <sente> gernatech: yeah I'm not complaining
[23:36:22] <geoid> there was a big discussion going down yesterday about javascript MVC frameworks.
[23:36:28] <geoid> like backbone.js
[23:37:00] <daslicht> sounds interesting
[23:37:06] <gernatech> what exactly about
[23:38:04] <geoid> question I had was about performance. Is it slower to fetch a page via a javascript MVC than via the normal php route - i.e. you are getting JSON from the server, pulling an HTML template from the server, and then populating content client side using the data.
[23:39:09] <gernatech> this is a good 1
[23:39:56] <gernatech> I'm guessing it won't be faster than the normal php route
[23:40:28] <sente> what is the "traditional php route"
[23:40:38] <sente> do you mean AJAX vs normal requests?
[23:41:29] <geoid> sente I mean that normally you serve HTML from php, so your app is built server-side and delivered to the client page by page. Whereas with javascript MVC you just get data from the server, and templates.
[23:41:30] <sente> regardless of what you mean, it's likely as fast, or faster, yes
[23:42:21] <sente> it really depends on the type of content you're loading
[23:42:53] <gernatech> wait I'm confused :S
[23:43:11] <sente> but I think it would be rare for the "MVC style" to be slower
[23:44:40] <gernatech> lol yeah
[23:46:40] <daslicht> anyone use jquery inconjunction with jsf ?
[23:47:01] <daslicht> wonder how good this works together
[23:48:38] <jstonne> geoid: I don't see how performance matters here. I think it's more of how codes are organized.
[23:49:08] <geoid> jstonne no good organizing your code well if it's a dog on the interwebs.
[23:49:16] <BFranks_> To put it in better terms, looking at the data format here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#categories   How should I split() this string  { label: "annhhx10", category: "Products" },{ label: "annk K12", category: "Products" }, etc.. ?  I've tried putting 5 spaces between the },     { and then split('     '); but that just gives me the raw data?
[23:49:38] <jstonne> geoid: Well it still boils down to making ajax calls.
[23:53:26] <jstonne> geoid: One of the things I find cumbersome, is how initial html content are served from servers, and subsequent html contents are generated by a json object + a client-side template, say, EJS.
[23:53:53] <jstonne> geoid: I haven't quite found a perfect marriage between those 2.
[23:54:10] <geoid> ya, agreed. Are you using a javascript MVC?
[23:54:51] <jstonne> geoid: Yes I've been mangling with jMVC in and out, then only to realize how Backbone is a lot cleaner.
[23:55:41] <geoid> agility.js seems to suggest that your body tag should start out empty, then you load everything in body using MVC
[23:56:48] <jstonne> This kind of practice have… limited use. Unless the entire app was supposed to be a…. web app.. from the ground up.
[23:57:12] <daslicht> how about creating html snapshots for the most recent "queries"
[23:57:35] <daslicht> than even search engines could very easy index "dynamic" pages
[23:58:40] <daslicht> why render a product list anytime new , just refresh the html snapshot after u added a new product :)
[23:58:42] <jstonne> daslicht: So the initial html content still gets served from the server anyway?
[23:58:59] <jstonne> daslicht: Ah I see.
[23:59:43] <daslicht> than we could reduce the ajax calls just on navigation
