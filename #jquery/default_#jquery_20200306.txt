[01:56:23] <jak2000> hi all
[02:06:54] <jak2000> any hand: https://jsfiddle.net/tekmd7gz/   how to get data-xrespcol_ value?
[02:11:49] <Guddu> Could someone please help me understand what this line of codes does here?
[02:11:50] <Guddu> table.buttons().container()
[02:11:50] <Guddu>         .appendTo( $('div.eight.column:eq(0)', table.table().container()) );
[02:11:53] <Guddu> https://datatables.net/extensions/buttons/examples/styling/semanticui.html
[02:12:44] <robertmaxrees> well
[02:13:11] <robertmaxrees> it's appending the result of table.buttons().container() to $('div.eight.column:eq(0)', table.table().container())
[02:14:30] <jak2000> hi robertmaxrees
[02:15:43] <robertmaxrees> hello
[02:17:04] <jphase> o/
[02:17:39] <jak2000> any advice? how to get get data-xrespcol_ value?  here my fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/tekmd7gz/
[02:17:56] <robertmaxrees> huyh?
[02:18:07] <robertmaxrees> .data('xrespcol_')
[02:18:16] <robertmaxrees> that's how to get the value of that dat attribute.
[02:18:53] <jak2000> i try: var xCol=$(`[data-xrespcol_"${widEmpleado}"`).find('.clSelRespo').text();
[02:18:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[02:19:18] <robertmaxrees> you mean how do you select on the value of a data attribute?
[02:19:48] <robertmaxrees> that's a weird thing to select on
[02:20:08] <jak2000> yes select/.... how to get the data value
[02:20:20] <jak2000> if you see exist 4 selects (in production i have 60)
[02:20:40] <robertmaxrees> .data(`-xrespcol_${widEmpleado}`)
[02:20:42] <robertmaxrees> ???
[02:20:54] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what you're asking.
[02:21:03] <robertmaxrees> trying simplifying your fiddle down to just the bare minimum.
[02:21:18] <Uhkis_> jak2000: maybe start with cleaning up those duplicate ids and use those instead for the selector
[02:21:26] <robertmaxrees> ^^ i guess?
[02:21:35] <robertmaxrees> like... your question doesn't really make sense.
[02:21:46] <jphase> jak2000: it sounds like you might need to loop through the elements that have that attribute to then do some conditions on it
[02:22:19] <robertmaxrees> or use .filter(function() {}) to get the one you want or something else.
[02:22:26] <jphase> ^
[02:22:54] <Uhkis> or tell us what you want to do instead of asking how to get the value
[02:23:05] <robertmaxrees> your question, as phrased, has been answered.  So it sounds like you want to do something that isn't what you're asking :)
[02:23:11] <robertmaxrees> might i suggest learn.jquery.com? :)
[02:23:27] <jak2000> :)
[02:23:35] <jak2000> always read jquery.com
[02:23:45] <robertmaxrees> * learn.jquery.com
[02:24:07] <jak2000> aum.....
[02:24:26] <robertmaxrees> ?
[02:24:41] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, DataTables is a great plugin.
[02:24:58] <robertmaxrees> lmao what even is tonight?
[02:25:08] <robertmaxrees> Guddu cool? :)
[02:25:18] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: it's morning what it is! :D
[02:25:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[02:25:35] <robertmaxrees> Guddu Ardbeg is great whisky.
[02:25:44] * jak2000 send 1 Budligth to robertmaxrees
[02:25:53] <robertmaxrees> Fans help me feel cooler.
[02:26:02] <robertmaxrees> Fender makes great guitars.
[02:26:08] <jphase> lol
[02:26:25] <robertmaxrees> I tell great jokes.
[02:26:39] <robertmaxrees> So anyway - what a night.
[02:27:19] <Uhkis> fender making great guitars would be a good example of a joke :D
[02:27:35] * jak2000 send 1 Coffe+Vodka to Uhkis
[02:27:48] <jphase> Hey now, Fender has made some good axes
[02:27:52] <Uhkis> no, don't ruin good coffee!
[02:27:55] <robertmaxrees> HEY WOAH.  My Strats would like to have a word with you.  As would Hendrix, both Vaughan brothers, and a crap ton of other people.
[02:28:08] <Uhkis> my LP says no
[02:28:13] <jphase> They're both great tone
[02:28:16] <jphase> very different
[02:28:20] <robertmaxrees> ^
[02:28:21] * jphase hands out green tea
[02:28:31] <robertmaxrees> Yeah, in that strats actually sound good and not muddy af.
[02:28:33] <robertmaxrees> jk
[02:28:40] <Uhkis> my strat wants to agree though
[02:28:43] <robertmaxrees> LPs have their place
[02:29:07] <robertmaxrees> tho Teles with 'buckers are a special thing, too.
[02:29:29] <jphase> Teles are ðŸ’£ diggity as well indeed! :)
[02:29:51] <Uhkis> yes, tele is the next guitar i'm gonna buy
[02:30:02] <Uhkis> gotta catch 'em all! :D
[02:30:10] <robertmaxrees> one of my favorite axes is a fender tele body with gibson 'buckers and a strat copy neck.
[02:30:19] <robertmaxrees> thing has TOAN
[02:30:34] <Uhkis> such frankenstein :)
[02:30:47] <robertmaxrees> such frankenstein, very jeff beck, wow.
[02:31:11] <robertmaxrees> cheapest guitar in my arsenal and was my number one for a minute.
[02:33:37] <Uhkis> yeah, price doesn't really mean anything
[02:33:43] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^
[02:33:44] <robertmaxrees> signed
[02:33:56] <Uhkis> or maybe defines instrument vs. collectable
[02:34:07] <Uhkis> rather have instruments :)
[02:34:20] <robertmaxrees> nah - i have a pricey "collectable" guitar that i play regularly.
[02:34:49] <robertmaxrees> KWS has a replica Hendrix Monterey Pop Strat that he also plays regularly.
[02:37:48] <Uhkis> hence the maybe
[02:37:59] <robertmaxrees> fair :)
[02:43:26] <jak2000> errro: https://jsfiddle.net/tekmd7gz/2/   jQuery line :14
[02:43:45] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 .data() is a jquery method.
[02:43:49] <robertmaxrees> you need a jquery object first.
[02:44:03] <robertmaxrees> it looks like you're trying to select an element based on a data attribute.
[02:44:45] <jak2000> yes
[02:46:18] <jak2000> also i try:var xCol=$(`[data-salary="${widEmpleado}"]`).val();   but return 0 the correct value is: 20
[02:46:41] <robertmaxrees> ðŸ™ƒ
[02:47:16] <jak2000> man i can change the salary with this way....
[02:47:20] <jak2000> would be same not?
[02:47:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[02:47:43] <robertmaxrees> you keep changing what you're trying to do.
[02:47:44] <Uhkis> jak2000: what are you trying to do? what is your goal?
[02:49:17] <robertmaxrees> I'ma leave y'all to it before I get more smarmy :) glhf all.
[02:49:53] <jak2000> 1) the user in the input (Salary Id:)type: 124  by sample, i go to row 124 (in this case first) and want get  data-xrespcol_     here new fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/tekmd7gz/5/   but get me a value of 3 (i think is the selected value)
[02:51:39] <jak2000> but i need the value of 20 (in this case)
[02:53:09] <Uhkis> so like this? https://jsfiddle.net/wh150t7o/

[11:49:36] <pennTeller> Hi guys, I have an array and would like to access all elements that are not the first and last. How could I do this?
[11:51:45] <pavonia> You mean from a query?
[11:53:38] <pennTeller> pavonia, Not a query. I have a table whose columns are described via an array. So if my table has 5 columns, the columns are described as [0,1,2,3,4].  I would like to "access" all elements from such array that are not the first or last. In python for example I would do it like this.   [0:-1]
[11:55:04] <pavonia> array = array.slice(1,-1)?
[11:55:35] <pennTeller> pavonia, that looks like what I need :) Let me test
[11:55:57] <pavonia> Or (1, -2) I guess
[12:02:54] <pennTeller> pavonia, thank you, I am still having some issues but your suggestion helped
[19:55:15] <Phruis> can you zoon the page with jquery?
