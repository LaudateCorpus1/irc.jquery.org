[01:22:57] <hd1> http://imeecoach.com/~hdiwan/links.cgi i'd like to turn the "Time" column in that output to ISO format... any ideas how to do about this? it's sourced from a log file that I can't change
[01:26:09] <Petazz> Hi! I'm trying to use the jQuery.floatThead but I'm getting a "undefined is not a function" somewhere deep in jquery. What can cause this and how could I debug it?
[01:34:37] <hd1> http://imeecoach.com/~hdiwan/links.cgi i'd like to turn the "Time" column in that output to ISO format... any ideas how to do about this? it's sourced from a log file that I can't change
[01:35:46] <amalloy> i have some jquery that generates dom elements like <a name="foo">...</a> at page-load time, but of course www.example.com/page#foo doesn't jump to that anchor, because it didn't exist when the page first loaded. is there a good way to scroll to the anchor/fragment point once it's ready?
[02:06:04] <brunoais> amalloy, why do you need to generate elements at page load?
[02:06:20] <brunoais> why won't you just send them to the browser when the browser reads the page?
[02:11:14] <amalloy> brunoais: it's someone else's "single-page app" sort of thing, that i just want to add this fragment-linking feature too; i can't rewrite the whole thing
[02:11:56] <brunoais> meh...
[02:12:12] <erming> amalloy: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6682451/jquery-animate-scroll-to-id-on-page-load
[02:12:12] <brunoais> stupid stupid single-page websites
[02:12:17] <brunoais> anyway
[02:12:44] <amalloy> thanks, brunoais
[02:13:54] <brunoais> amalloy, erming's link has the hack for it
[02:14:14] <brunoais> you just need to read the hash, though
[02:14:21] <brunoais> alternatively, I'd do differentely
[02:14:41] <brunoais> I'd read the URL and then It'd resend the user to the same URL
[02:14:49] <brunoais> that should make the browser go to the id
[02:15:04] <brunoais> In the jQuery option, it animates (which can go well or awfully wrong)
[02:15:26] <amalloy> oh, i misread who the link was from! thanks erming too
[02:16:12] <brunoais> I don't like to take credit for things I don't do <_<
[02:16:30] <brunoais> the opposite also evaluates true :)
[02:17:15] <erming> haven't been dealing with hashes before, but i think you can get it from the global variable: window.location.hash
[02:17:25] <brunoais> true
[02:17:33] <erming> like say, http://site.com/#anchor-id
[02:17:34] <brunoais> but older browsers just spit undefined
[02:17:41] <erming> window.location.hash would return "#anchor-id"
[02:18:08] <brunoais> nothing that a polyfill can't solve :D
[02:18:15] <brunoais> still...
[02:18:58] <erming> oh
[02:19:02] <erming> i love that google breaks in IE7
[02:19:02] <erming> :D
[02:19:36] <erming> brunoais: window.location.hash seems to work for IE7+
[02:19:57] <brunoais> erming, ok, sounds safe then
[02:20:02] <erming> setting it, the new "html5"-way, is probabably the cross-browser issues you're thinking about
[02:20:19] <erming> but just fetching it like that seems to work
[02:20:26] <brunoais> yeah, caniuse says it's safe
[02:20:36] <brunoais> maybe, yes
[02:20:51] <brunoais> I got used to use pushState(), though
[02:42:54] <joobie> guys, im doin this http://pastebin.com/cNz8htRR which finds a form with id of _xclick and then gives me the html within it
[02:43:05] <joobie> it works find, except how can i make it include the <form> element itself?
[02:43:22] <joobie> it's giving me the inner part of <form> but not <form> itself
[02:57:11] <joobie> hello?
[03:50:53] <io_____> hi i am trying to do something like url.indexOf('url1'||'url2) > -1   but it seems like it doesn t work using the OR in between the 2 urls, how to achieve that?
[03:56:20] <erming> io_____: you have to do it like this: if (url.indexOf('url1') > -1 || url.indexOf('url2') > -1)
[03:56:41] <erming> you see, doing what you just did with 'url1' || 'url2' => will always return 'url1'
[03:56:46] <io_____> erming: yes i get it ot there, i was ondering if there was a more elegant solution
[03:57:21] <io_____> erming: would be more comfortable to group the urls on an array and compare to the array
[03:57:31] <io_____> but it owrks like that..
[03:57:32] <erming> did that kind of thing some week ago, had the same thoughts :D
[03:57:56] <erming> but you could create a helper function
[04:05:41] <erming> io_____: http://jsfiddle.net/WuQw7/
[04:05:43] <erming> had some fund with it
[04:06:20] <erming> use it like: url.contains(url1, url2) // you can use unlimited parameters. the function returns true or false
[04:06:37] <io_____> erming: thank you I ll try that
[04:07:01] <io_____> do jsfiddles have a life span?
[04:07:31] <erming> i don't think it'll go away
[04:09:02] <decx> until piotr can't pay the bills anymore
[04:09:29] <decx> but maybe mozilla pays those *fingers crossed*
[04:10:58] <erming> io_____: i put it up here too: https://gist.github.com/erming/11317321
[04:12:11] <io_____> erming: thank you very appreciated, I am fixing some more stuff right now I ll get to it later on today
[04:12:13] <erming> man, GitHubs editor is alot better than the one on JSFiddle
[04:12:39] <erming> io_____: np! it was fun anyway :)
[04:12:40] <pragma-> defiantly
[04:13:03] <pragma-> your so rite. its alot more better.
[04:15:25] <erming> GitHub uses https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace
[04:15:29] <erming> JSFiddle: http://codemirror.net/
[04:15:42] <erming> if i got that right.. :>
[05:51:54] <n-a-n> hi all
[05:57:20] <Danielss89> Hi
[05:57:44] <Danielss89> When using .on should’nt dynamicly added documents still trigger?
[05:58:26] <Danielss89> for example, i have: $('.image-delete').on('click', function(e){… but if i add an image with that class and click it, nothing happens
[06:01:05] <brunoais> danheberden, you got the wrong idea
[06:01:17] <brunoais> that's not what you want
[06:01:56] <brunoais> The selector you want to use is of the DOM element(s) that will include the images
[06:02:26] <brunoais> then you use the 2nd param to specify the CSS selector of what you want, in this case, '.image-delete'
[06:05:20] <amunra> Is there a jquery plugin that has the similar effect that www.springpad.com uses on boxes while the user scrolls down the page?
[06:06:57] <erming> halp! I need to render alot of markup server-side, but I don't want the markup to be parsed by the DOM. However! I want to be able to read this "hidden" markup (think html-comments-ish) by jQuery. Anyone know a way to do it?
[06:12:40] <erming> found a solution: putting stuff inside <script type="text/html"></script>
[07:48:30] <melkor> What is a good way to scroll to an element?
[08:29:19] <StephenS> When I load html from external script, I cannot manage to load script, from src, actually I load it but it's loading very slow and page stuck, what to do?
[08:32:18] <BillCriswell> melkor: animate scrollTop on body to the top of the element you want to scroll to
[08:32:44] <StephenS> BillCriswell got idea for me?
[08:33:04] <melkor> BillCriswell: oddly enough scrollTop wasn't getting me anywhere. I installed a jquery plugin 'scrollIntoView'.
[08:33:22] <StephenS> Initialy I thought about $('.h').append("<script src='s.js'></script>"); //... $('.h').append(html);
[08:33:31] <BillCriswell> melkor: Might have been doing something weird.
[08:35:06] <melkor> BillCriswell: Yes. probably some simple mistake. I wasn't sure what scrollTop should do so I tried the plugin.
[08:40:21] <BillCriswell> StephenS: You want to load just a script then use that
[08:40:23] <BillCriswell> ?
[08:41:19] <StephenS> The thing is I have a index.php with scripts inside it, and div elements and such which use src="/js/somescript.js" and when I load with ajax from external.php into newdiv and append html to it, that sources on index.php are not applicable on that new data (html)
[08:41:45] <StephenS> Have no idea why, so I put javascript code into external.php when I append data to html.
[08:42:05] <StephenS> that works, but its very slow and inefficient and my website stuck when that call is made.
[08:42:59] <BillCriswell> It's very hard to tell what you're doing.
[08:43:13] <BillCriswell> Can you mock up your code at jsbin.com?
[08:43:15] <StephenS> Hmm
[08:43:19] <StephenS> really hard
[08:43:23] <StephenS> There is a lot of code there
[08:44:30] <StephenS> But what I do is, index.php contain maindiv and script src="myscript.js" which is applicable on maindiv and do some stuff on that dom, however when I load data to var html and do maindiv.append(html) that new div does not have script, so myscript.js is not working for new maindiv
[08:44:33] <StephenS> is that better?
[08:49:53] <BillCriswell> So the script is inside the element you want to do something on?
[08:51:16] <StephenS> BillCriswell yes
[08:52:12] <BillCriswell> If your code in a document ready? Ideally, you wouldn't be doing this. It's just messy.
[10:06:13] <StephenS> BillCriswell how to do it then? <div class="news">some news</div> <script>news script...</script>
[10:06:57] <BillCriswell> StephenS: You'd put this scripts into an external JS file and use it.
[10:07:00] <StephenS> in extern.php I have <div class="news">new news2....</div> and I pull it into index.php with append(html) so html contains that div and text, however news script will not apply to that new appended data BillCriswell
[10:07:04] <Taggnostr2> I have a table, and I want to join all the cells in the same column that are equal with a rowspan.  What selector/snippet could I use to find how many consecutive cells have the same value?
[10:07:10] <StephenS> yes that does not work
[10:07:33] <StephenS> actually works but it slows down website way too much
[10:08:19] <BillCriswell> StephenS: It does work. What are you trying to do with each news item?
[10:09:12] <BillCriswell> Taggnostr2: So all tds that have a rowspan of x?
[10:09:33] <StephenS> BillCriswell I have rate system so when someone clicks a rate, I need custom unique id, so I had to have script inside news div.
[10:10:09] <decx> huh
[10:10:38] <Taggnostr2> BillCriswell, like this: http://jsfiddle.net/3AscL/
[10:10:57] <BillCriswell> Taggnostr2: Ah.
[10:11:32] <Taggnostr2> BillCriswell, in other word I have to look at the cells in a column, see if there are consecutive cells with the same value and merge them by assigning rowspan to the first and deleting the ones with the same value underneath
[10:11:37] <Taggnostr2> words*
[10:11:56] <BillCriswell> Taggnostr2: I understand. Trying to think of a way to accomplish it.
[10:12:08] <BillCriswell> Well, a good way.
[10:12:25] <tandroid> Hey, I'm trying to add a span before each line of text in a paragraph. I found a stackoverflow solution where they add a span around each line, and I'm trying to modify it but with no luck.
[10:12:28] <decx> programmatically changing tables? good luck
[10:12:32] <tandroid> here is the stack overlflow solution http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4147080/can-i-wrap-each-line-of-multi-line-text-in-a-span
[10:12:34] <Taggnostr2> fwiw I'm using datatables -- I wonder if there's a way to do it from there directly
[10:13:14] <StephenS> BillCriswell I had for example elastic jquery addon in src on main index.php page and it didnt applied to textarea pulled via ajax (html).
[10:13:33] <tandroid> and here are my examples of before and after. span around each line: http://jsfiddle.net/TQu24/1/ span before each line(attempt): http://jsfiddle.net/7KkBD/
[10:13:40] <StephenS> so I had to include in extern.php and call that script again which is absurd.
[10:15:17] <Taggnostr2> BillCriswell, this is the table I'm working on: http://wolfprojects.altervista.org/patches.html
[10:16:18] <BillCriswell> StephenS: http://jsbin.com/begujazu/1/edit?html,js,output This might be helpful.
[10:17:14] <Taggnostr2> BillCriswell, found http://jsfiddle.net/djhU7/4/ on stackoverflow
[10:17:20] <StephenS> thank you
[10:17:52] <StephenS> BillCriswell but main problem remain.
[10:17:57] <BillCriswell> Taggnostr2: That's how I was going to approach it.
[10:18:09] <Taggnostr2> it has a fixed rowspan though
[10:20:17] <StephenS> BillCriswell I have for example:
[10:20:22] <StephenS> http://pastebin.com/aRvbf1kd do you see hidden close code?
[10:20:40] <StephenS> That code works on index.php but when I scroll and get this: $("#updates").append(html);
[10:21:03] <StephenS> and that data get appended to the ID: updates, when I hover over news, I don't get displayed that hidden close button.
[10:21:05] <StephenS> Do you understand my issue now?
[10:21:59] <StephenS> maybe id updates is not in correct form or something?
[10:22:55] <StephenS> BillCriswell any idea?
[10:23:04] <decx> i don't know about your other issues StephenS , but you can't do all that shit on window scroll
[10:23:22] <BillCriswell> StephenS: I think you want event delegation but if you could set up a simple demo of the html that's output and the javascript it would be much easier.
[10:23:26] <StephenS> decx what do you mean?
[10:23:27] <BillCriswell> Taggnostr2: Ah, good point.
[10:23:45] <decx> window scroll should only update existing values and call simple functions as it's constantly happening when users scroll
[10:23:57] <BillCriswell> Taggnostr2: Won't this code mess up when someone sorts the table?
[10:24:24] <StephenS> decx thats simulation of infinity scroll loop
[10:24:43] <StephenS> and scroll works, I used to have click event for a more button, but I changed it to the scroll, and that works fine.
[10:24:46] <decx> you deffo want to cache all these vars
[10:24:50] <Taggnostr2> BillCriswell, I hope it won't, but I will have to see
[10:24:58] <StephenS> I can change it to click morebutton again, but that is not my issue
[10:25:09] <BillCriswell> Taggnostr2: Try doing something minor to the table and see what happens first.
[10:25:16] <Taggnostr2> good idea
[10:25:17] <StephenS> my issue is, data which is appended to the ID: updates is not working for javascripts.
[10:25:40] <StephenS> so script news.js is not applicable to the id updates.
[10:25:43] <StephenS> I have no idea why.
[10:25:54] <jmoseman01> hey doesn't anyone know how to use the jquery validation plug-in
[10:25:56] <jmoseman01> ?
[10:26:04] <StephenS> you can see hiddenclose() function, it's in ready method
[10:26:40] <decx> i'm too lazy to debug load more script code, i'm just telling you that you have to keep your window scroll lean and mean or else your site will be sluggish
[10:27:47] <StephenS> ..
[10:32:55] <BillCriswell> StephenS: http://jsbin.com/gusagila/1/edit?css,js,output Does this help?
[10:33:30] <StephenS> no
[10:33:35] <StephenS> BillCriswell you don't understand
[10:33:40] <StephenS> the issue is when I call data via ajax
[10:33:53] <BillCriswell> StephenS: Right.
[10:34:03] <BillCriswell> Which is what I'm basically replicating with the setTimeout
[10:34:14] <StephenS> look at http://pastebin.com/aRvbf1kd
[10:34:17] <BillCriswell> You're tring to attach events to elements that don't exist.
[10:35:45] <StephenS> ?
[10:36:57] <StephenS> what is wrong with my code again/
[10:37:51] <StephenS> BillCriswell elements exists in my code
[10:40:45] <StephenS> BillCriswell here is html: http://pastebin.com/bASMbuQx
[10:41:03] <StephenS> as you can see there is hidden close, and I put that same html into extern.php and that script is not applicable.
[10:41:17] <StephenS> can you re-check what is happening? I'm unsure what you are trying to do..
[10:43:47] <StephenS> I think what you were trying to tell me, I need delegate.
[11:24:17] <relipse> who was the guy who made the spaceship game
[11:24:24] <relipse> i've come to find out i suck at making games and i need some help
[11:26:10] <sledgeDJ> need some help with this. have a page called index.php it should have some filter options. when the filter options are submitted the chart ont ha page should change. the chart is generated by a different page, chart.php   and appears on the first page (index,php) via ajax without reloading.  what is the best way to do this? is there any sample code online?
[11:28:45] <relipse> decx you there?
[11:43:15] <sledgeDJ> need some help with this. have a page called index.php it should have some filter options. when the filter options are submitted the chart ont ha page should change. the chart is generated by a different page, chart.php   and appears on the first page (index,php) via ajax without reloading.  what is the best way to do this? is there any sample code online?
[11:43:25] <sledgeDJ> basically i know how to make the php pages
[11:44:00] <sledgeDJ> i just dont know how to pass the GET variables from the form through the ajax and have it display the reults page on the first page without a rfresh
[11:47:28] <StephenS> sledgeDJ show some code
[11:49:15] <sacho> sledgeDJ, check out the documentation for load()
[11:50:23] <hpekdemir> hi all. is there any plugin which gives me a nice console like display on my websit?
[11:50:26] <hpekdemir> e
[11:51:00] <hpekdemir> or let me ask this way: I want to start a batch operation in the backend (on server) and want to display everything that happens with some nice log entries on the website
[11:51:29] <hpekdemir> like user clicks on button. backend starts and outputs "Preparing script...", "COnfiguring environment", etc.
[11:51:39] <hpekdemir> and all updated on website in almost real time.
[11:51:54] <hpekdemir> is long polling (comet) useful for this?
[11:53:12] <sledgeDJ> sacho: thanks load() looks great but what if i want to pass a bunch of info
[11:55:50] <StephenS> What is wrong with delegate in here: hidden-close button works and show on hover, however  textarea (.fulltext) on load is displayed, instead it should be hidden, and on button click, showed... can soeone look at up and help me: http://pastebin.com/wqJhqV6y
[11:56:10] <sacho> doesn't it have a data parameter?
[11:58:19] <sacho> why are you adding a click handler within your mouseover handler, stephens?
[12:03:53] <Taggnostr2> is there to loop through the elements returned by a selector in reversed order?
[12:04:03] <Taggnostr2> is there a way*
[12:05:24] <sacho> why do you need to loop through them?
[12:08:32] <Taggnostr2> sacho, I have a table with a few rows, I want to go from the last to the first, count how many cells on the same column have the same value, and then set a rowspan once I reach the one at the top
[12:09:55] <sacho> Why do you need to go from the last to first in this case
[12:10:16] <Taggnostr2> because the rowspan will be set on the one at the top
[12:10:42] <Taggnostr2> if I go from top to bottom, once I saw that there are e.g. 5 cells with the same values, I'll have to go back to the first and set it there
[12:10:50] <Taggnostr2> even though I guess I could keep a reference around
[12:11:00] <Taggnostr2> that might be easier actually
[12:14:04] <sledgeDJ> sacho: how do i pass the form in to the data variable in load()
[12:15:15] <sacho> check out serialize()
[12:15:31] <sacho> or you might be looking for serializeArray, I forget which
[12:16:48] <sledgeDJ> ok thanks
[12:17:27] <sledgeDJ> sacho: last question... What about if i want links to submit stuff to not just the form
[12:17:45] <sacho> well, the data you pass is a javascript object
[12:17:47] <sledgeDJ> how can i make the link also pass tot he load()
[12:17:52] <sacho> you can add anything you want to it
[12:19:57] <sacho> unf, serializeArray converts the data to such a weird format
[12:33:58] <StephenS> sacho what to add then
[12:34:17] <StephenS> because I need click function on that X button to hide that div
[12:35:00] <sacho> that's fine, but why are you adding it in the mouseover handler?
[12:35:26] <StephenS> because its set to display:none
[12:35:31] <StephenS> so I need to 1st to display it
[12:36:18] <sacho> you can attach a click handler to it beforehand just fine :)
[12:36:51] <StephenS> anyhow that is not the issue
[12:36:56] <StephenS> issue is with my textarea (class: fulltext)
[12:37:03] <StephenS> its showed when I click on link which call this function
[12:37:06] <StephenS> dunno why, can you check it?
[12:37:38] <sledgeDJ> i want to show you my coding issues but it seems jsfiddle doesnt support load()
[12:37:49] <sledgeDJ> how do i have jsfiddle load an external page?
[12:38:30] <sacho> off the jsfiddle domain? you won't be able to, really
[12:39:03] <decx> create another fiddle and load that
[12:39:04] <sledgeDJ> sacho: so how do i show you my issue then?
[12:40:01] <decx> like this: http://jsfiddle.net/decx/rqnLY/
[12:41:57] <Sajaki> hi, can i put multiple $(document).ready(function($){ } in the same page ?
[12:41:58] <decx> yes but they won't share scope
[12:54:19] <StephenS> so sacho decx any idea how to fix my tectarea?
[12:54:23] <StephenS> textarea*
[13:05:18] <decx> wasnt it lazy load earlier?
[13:11:29] <StephenS> decx it is
[13:11:39] <StephenS> that's why I'm trying to make events so I don't have to write all javascripts again in ajax_post.php (extern.php)
[13:11:53] <StephenS> <BillCriswell> You're tring to attach events to elements that don't exist.
[13:12:13] <StephenS> and he was right with that, I don't have elements, only htm lparsing when pulling data from ajax_post
[13:12:15] <phelix>  I am using jquery isotope. http://isotope.metafizzy.co/ Would anyone have an idea how I could limit the results to only display so many items ?
[13:15:01] <StephenS> to be precise I managed to work it out, however only when I hover my mouse in and out, decx code: http://pastebin.com/bGAtMa8i
[13:15:21] <StephenS> now my problem is which event to use (not mouseout) to make it hidden on default.
[13:15:30] <StephenS> thats just what I'm asking atm
[13:17:01] <codepython777> I've an index.html that I am planning to use to render 100s of slides. I'd like to code a search engine functionality into js. Whats a good library to use for this? (Apart from just using string search)
[13:30:52] <BillCriswell> That burrito was excellent.
[13:33:29] <StephenS> nice for you BillCriswell
[13:33:43] <StephenS> but I am having still the issue, I made a step forward though
[13:34:11] <StephenS> I make elements to attach events as you suggested, however textarea on load is not hidden when it should be, code: http://pastebin.com/bGAtMa8i
[13:34:23] <StephenS> Can you check it and see whats wrong BillCriswell ? Thanks.
[13:35:20] <tds5016> Hi all, I'm having a problem with setInterval https://dpaste.de/wgDs#L56,66,83,84,85,86,87
[13:35:45] <tds5016> it appears in my setInterval that for some reason the jquery extend is causing the value I'm setting with backbone not to be updated on a fetch.
[13:43:56] <Taggnostr2> how do I remove an attribute from an element?
[13:45:21] <BillCriswell> Taggnostr2: .removeAttr()
[13:45:27] <Taggnostr2> thanks
[13:45:45] <BillCriswell> StephenS: If you put it in jsbin I can mes swith the code. Just looking at the text is a pain.
[13:46:15] <BillCriswell> Taggnostr2: No problem.
[13:47:03] <StephenS> I just need instead of mouseout
[13:47:10] <StephenS> something which will trigger when textarea is loaded
[13:47:32] <StephenS> Also I don't quite understand how will I put multiple elements on load aja
[13:47:35] <StephenS> x
[13:48:02] <Taggnostr2> BillCriswell, it almost works: http://wolfprojects.altervista.org/patches.html
[13:48:08] <Taggnostr2> still chasing some bug here and there...
[13:48:43] <LeonardDa> Hi guys. I'm recursively displaying hidden <li>-Elements. Even though I use "0" as delay or "1" it is very slow. How can I make this faster?
[13:52:19] <BillCriswell> Taggnostr2: Niiice.
[13:52:25] <LeonardDa> ok fixed it
[13:55:10] <Taggnostr2> BillCriswell, and the last bug should be fixed now :)
[13:57:43] <BillCriswell> Taggnostr2: Glad you got it worked out.
[14:07:10] <oniMaker> Is there a way to use serialize() or serializeArray() with $.post to submit form values?
[14:07:55] <BillCriswell> oniMaker: You can use either with post.
[14:08:00] <ace_me> I have a google map in a canvas map and later after I zoom or pan the map I am opening a modal into which I would like to have the same map as before on the page.... I've thought th omve the html() content to modal but I am afraid that the canvas attribute of the existing map will not be updated if I do like this
[14:08:02] <oniMaker> BillCriswell: how so?
[14:08:20] <oniMaker> BillCriswell: I'd also like to add on to them
[14:08:27] <BillCriswell> $.post('/foo/add', $('#someForm').serializeArray(), function(){ });
[14:09:04] <BillCriswell> oniMaker: Then I'd do var data = $('#someForm').serializeArray(); and add to it like data.push({name:"new_field", value: "Some new value" });
[14:09:19] <BillCriswell> then $.post('/foo', data) obviously.
[14:09:33] <oniMaker> hmm ok
[14:09:51] <oniMaker> I vaguely recall somehow using $.extend with a serialize method
[14:11:09] <BillCriswell> oniMaker: serialize returns a string and serializeArray returns an array so not sure how you'd use $.extend() there.
[14:11:28] <oniMaker> yeah, not sure either... just something I thought I had done before
[14:11:33] <oniMaker> that would be most convenient
[14:11:41] <oniMaker> since I want to post an object of key/value pairs
[14:12:30] <BillCriswell> oniMaker: You could make your own object of values of you'd want from serializeArray pretty easily.
[14:12:48] <oniMaker> BillCriswell: yeah, I saw a couple functions out there for that too
[14:12:56] <oniMaker> thought I'd see if there was a builtin way though
[14:13:51] <BillCriswell> oniMaker: Not that I'm aware of. Always wondered why not, but the array is easy enough to work with that i never thought about it.
[14:14:08] <oniMaker> BillCriswell: ok, I'll give that a shot. Thanks!
[14:14:09] <BillCriswell> never worried about it*
[14:14:13] <BillCriswell> No problem.

[14:49:10] <jquery_> Hi.  Can anyone recommend a good, simple and lightweight notification plugin?  I need to display notifications in the top right corner of the screen when certain things happen.

[15:04:22] <michelem> hello folks
[15:04:37] <michelem> how do I add a ":invalid" pseudo-class when an input does not validate?
[15:14:35] <oniMaker> michelem: why not add an 'invalid' class
[15:15:02] <decx> michelem http://jsfiddle.net/decx/RkTq6/
[15:17:14] <michelem> decx: im confused
[15:17:41] <michelem> where does that setCustomValidity come from?
[15:17:59] <decx> the setcustomvalidity function is built in and sets a property which :invalid css relies on
[15:18:46] <michelem> I'm gonna try and use HTML5's "pattern" and leave old clients hit server-side validation
[15:19:31] <StephenS> Ding Dong
[15:19:42] <decx> note that you can'T apply that function to jquery objects
[15:20:11] <StephenS> note daAT
[15:20:46] <decx> with jq you have to do $('.checkit')[0].setCustomValidity('Nope') for a single or $('.checkit').each(function(){this.setCustomValidity('Nope')}) for multiple
[15:21:09] <decx> no idea if there's a jquery equivalent
[15:21:17] <erming> evening
[15:21:20] <decx> prop something
[15:22:20] <Horacsio> I need a colaborator. I will pay to solve an issue with jquery, ajax and WPML menu style issue.

[18:18:29] <zylophone> in a sortable, how is the height of a placeholder decided?
[18:18:51] <zylophone> i'm working with some code where the placeholder for one li is much bigger than another, and i'm trying to figure out why
[18:29:39] <TheJHNZ> o/
[18:30:05] <TheJHNZ> Is there a way to set a click event on a wrapper, but ignore clicks on elements inside the wrapper ?
[19:27:41] <BillCriswell> TheJHNZ: Yeah, just check the event.target.
[19:29:14] <BillCriswell> TheJHNZ: I imagine you don't want the event happening on any of the specified element's children, either?
[19:32:32] <BillCriswell> TheJHNZ: http://jsbin.com/cuzolere/1/edit?html,js,output Here is a small demo.
[19:36:32] <TheJHNZ> sorted it
[19:36:49] <TheJHNZ>  $("#edit-settings-form input:file").change(function (){
[19:36:53] <TheJHNZ> this worked
[19:37:05] <TheJHNZ> oh
[19:37:10] <TheJHNZ> that was another thing
[19:37:15] <TheJHNZ> i just put e.stopPropagation();
[19:37:17] <TheJHNZ> on the child
[19:37:37] <BillCriswell> Oh ok.
[22:14:11] <mipo> hi
[22:14:49] <mipo> this is my code: https://dpaste.de/Zte8 it got me this error: Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[22:17:08] <gry_> (resent from ##javascript) i have an embed element, how do i take a picture of what it is currently showing using jquery?
[22:26:47] <wa5ted> hi if i have some text in  a <p> and an img in an <img> in the same div, is it possible to set the max width of the <p> text to 800px and set the <img> width to say 1400px
[22:27:03] <wa5ted> just to clarify
[22:27:07] <acidjazz> do you want the image to bleed out of the p
[22:27:15] <acidjazz> or hide
[22:27:17] <wa5ted> the p tag and img tag are in the same containing div
[22:27:26] <acidjazz> oh img is not in p
[22:27:39] <wa5ted> acidjazz: ideally i would want the container to be 1400px and the image to fit to it
[22:27:47] <wa5ted> and then the text to remain at 800px
[22:27:56] <acidjazz> thats fine
[22:27:58] <wa5ted> i guess i could set the p tag width
[22:28:04] <acidjazz> yup
[22:30:46] <wa5ted> acidjazz: thank god i put the text in p tags
[22:30:54] <wa5ted> otehrwise id have to fix 100 pages
[22:30:56] <wa5ted> not fun
[22:31:11] <wa5ted> could have a program generate them for me i suppose
[22:31:20] <acidjazz> yes you should
[22:31:29] <acidjazz> check out php or node w/ jade
[22:31:43] <acidjazz> wa5ted: http://jade-lang.com/
