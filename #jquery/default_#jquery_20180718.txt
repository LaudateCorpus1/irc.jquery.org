[04:08:42] <Anamol> hello how do fadetoggle 2 divs ( 1 invisible when another visible)?
[04:09:18] <Cork> you mean a crossfade?
[04:10:46] <Anamol> https://jsfiddle.net/eofbjw57/1/
[04:10:55] <Anamol> nah just fade in and out
[04:11:07] <Anamol> making 1 div fade out and another div fade in
[04:11:36] <Cork> uh, you should never have .ready inside another function
[04:12:28] <Anamol> just did that cause it was creating problems inside my console
[04:12:32] <Anamol> $ not defined
[04:12:37] <Anamol> i updated it can u check
[04:12:47] <Anamol> https://jsfiddle.net/eofbjw57/8/
[04:14:42] <Cork> witch is suppose to be hidden?
[04:14:47] <Cork> (from the start)
[04:16:08] <Anamol> hmm
[04:16:28] <Anamol> i want to toggle 'Front end Developer' and ' Web Designer'
[04:16:45] <Anamol> when Front end developer is displayed web designer should be hidden
[04:17:05] <Anamol> and after certain time front end fades out and web designer fades in
[04:17:24] <Anamol> just the use of fadeToggle is enough?
[04:17:29] <Cork> so you want to show both, then hide web designer?
[04:17:43] <Anamol> nah web designer is hidden by default
[04:17:49] <Anamol> with the help of css
[04:17:55] <Anamol> i didnt just add in the js to show u
[04:18:01] <Anamol> fiddle*
[04:19:37] <Cork> Anamol: https://jsfiddle.net/eofbjw57/19/
[04:19:58] <Cork> the jump comes from Frontend Developer getting hidden when it hits opacity: 0
[04:20:21] <Cork> you might alternativley want to use animate({ opacity: 'toggle' }) instead
[04:20:31] <Cork> depending on what effect you're looking for
[04:20:48] <Cork> (or you can use css @keyframe and animate it there instead)
[04:22:01] <Anamol> last time i tried using toggle only
[04:22:04] <Anamol> with interval
[04:22:14] <Anamol> the jump didnt showed up
[04:22:21] <Anamol>  i just wanted some animations
[04:23:06] <Anamol> https://jsfiddle.net/eofbjw57/22/
[04:23:12] <Anamol> Cork check  this no jump
[04:23:42] <Cork> ya, but that isn't any animation either
[04:24:03] <Anamol> yep , can i add fade animation to this code?
[04:24:10] <Anamol> how can i*
[04:24:19] <Cork> yes, but then you will have the both element visible at the same time problem again
[04:24:35] <Cork> so what you want is a crossfade, like i asked about originally
[04:25:54] <Anamol> i had no idea about crossfade sorry
[04:25:58] <Anamol> how can i achieve it
[04:35:37] <Cork> Anamol: is something like this what you're looking for? https://jsfiddle.net/eofbjw57/39/
[04:35:57] <Anamol> exactly
[04:36:01] <Anamol> u did without jquery
[04:36:01] <Anamol> wow
[04:36:18] <Cork> the important part is the wrapper div and the absolute position
[04:36:32] <Anamol> its toggling pretty quick
[04:36:42] <Cork> just change the 2s to something else
[04:37:25] <Anamol> hmm not helping
[04:37:34] <Cork> sure it does
[04:37:37] <Anamol> animation css?
[04:37:40] <Cork> yes
[04:38:00] <Anamol> i made it 10s still toggling at same  speed
[04:38:25] <Anamol> nvm its working now
[04:39:06] <Anamol> thanks
[04:39:18] <Cork> you would have to dig into animation and @keyframes to make it do this correctly
[04:39:23] <Cork> this is just a quick hack
[04:42:33] <Anamol> ah okay
[05:35:30] <Minnebo> I have a mini website (bootstrap)
[05:35:47] <Minnebo> I have a home.php file and i'm trying to load a jquery file
[05:36:02] <Minnebo> <script src="my.js"></script> this is my query
[05:36:14] <Minnebo> But it will not load :<
[05:36:41] <Cork> Minnebo: are you serving the files on a webserver?
[05:37:36] <Minnebo> running XAMPP in my test environment
[05:38:18] <Cork> then don't use relative urls
[05:40:59] <Minnebo> it gets loaded according to debugger tool
[05:41:05] <Minnebo> guess my jquery is just wrong xD
[05:41:33] <Cork> the comment about using absolute paths is still important though
[05:41:43] <Minnebo> https://css-tricks.com/swapping-out-text-five-different-ways/
[05:41:51] <Minnebo> I'm using this now like the other scripts sec
[05:41:52] <Cork> cause when/if you start using multiple folders relative urls is hell
[05:41:58] <Minnebo> https://css-tricks.com/swapping-out-text-five-different-ways/
[05:42:02] <Minnebo> ow sry
[05:42:06] <Minnebo> <script type="text/javascript" src="../web/js/my.js"></script>
[05:42:13] <Minnebo> that is better right
[05:42:28] <Minnebo> (have put the file in that folder offcourse)
[05:42:41] <Cork> no, that is still relative
[05:43:02] <Cork> you should have something like <script src="/js/my.js"></script>
[05:43:21] <Cork> always give the location related to the root of the domain
[05:43:54] <Cork> cause else you will have to start changing urls based on the html resource location
[05:44:21] <Minnebo> ok
[06:05:45] <Minnebo> http://new.exabyte.be/
[06:06:10] <Minnebo> why is the collapse thing starting open? :(
[07:27:37] * AdamPDotty sees nothing no open
[07:27:51] <AdamPDotty> but it sounded like accessibility
[07:31:00] <jqueryBeginner> Can someone help me? https://jsfiddle.net/bh80g7dy/  Trying to find the element, there are hundreds like this in the practical application- but if I can get this much working I'll be OK
[07:31:33] <Cork> jqueryBeginner: don't use event attributes and it should be a lot easier
[07:33:13] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/bh80g7dy/2/
[07:35:45] <jqueryBeginner> Thank you Cork  :)
[07:36:11] <jqueryBeginner> This makes more sense, I think maybe I'm inept when it comes to reading the official documentation
[07:36:53] <Cork> jqueryBeginner: also you prob want to add some classes to those elements to make them easier to select
[08:31:35] <paulobrien> Good afternoon all
[08:32:05] <paulobrien> I'm seeing some load issues for cdn.jquery.com (connection interrupted), I was wondering if this is a known issue?
[08:34:15] <Cork> paulobrien: it might be a specific cdn node that has problem
[08:34:33] <Cork> unless you find someone from the same area it isn't likely you will find someone seeing the same problem
[08:34:47] <paulobrien> Yeah, I was wondering if that's the case
[08:35:24] <Cork> i don't know of any bug tracker or similar for infra issues so can't tell if it is known
[08:35:45] <Cork> i think the cdn is driven by a third party too so might not even be anything anyone is looking at; donno
[11:49:34] <MacroMan> If I have an .on('change blur', ...) on a text input, it fires twice when I change the value. Is there to ensure it only fires once?
[11:49:46] <MacroMan> I understand why it fires twice, but looking for a workaround
[12:02:41] <taplar> use 'input' instead
[12:03:01] <taplar> or just use change
[12:03:13] <taplar> depending on what you are trying ot do
[13:28:28] <robertmaxrees> oontz oontz oontz oontz
[13:28:45] * taplar dances
[13:31:36] <robertmaxrees> helluva week so far.
[13:32:07] <taplar> oh?
[13:32:39] <robertmaxrees> have to leave work early today and friday for gigs with the band, working on hiring a lawyer, dealing with the county
[13:32:41] <robertmaxrees> all sorts of fun.
[13:33:02] <taplar> ouch
[13:35:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah...
[13:35:05] <robertmaxrees> how's your week
[13:35:07] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:37:09] <taplar> fairly busy.  started working on adding the user interface for doing a background check to our app.  trying to burn semantic markup into my brain and testing the new pages with a reader.  fun, but time consuming
[13:38:27] <robertmaxrees> sounds pretty interesting actually.
[13:39:53] <taplar> it's interesting going from just using whatever works to actually trying to structure it properly.
[13:40:22] <robertmaxrees> especially with modern html
[13:41:13] <taplar> yeah.  and then listening to the page, you find places where you're like, ohhh, we need to inject a pause there possibly.  This thing could use some extra flavor text, and stuff
[13:41:32] <taplar> like, we have the disclosures separated into steps, which a visual person can see there are four of
[13:41:48] <taplar> but for a screen reader we have label text that makes it read it and then says "step # of 4"
[13:41:56] <taplar> so it's more friendly
[13:43:46] <taplar> i think that's the part i have the most fun with
[13:44:44] <robertmaxrees> accessibility is a big deal - amazes me more people aren't concerned with it.  we're getting started on considering it more for out stuff.
[13:44:55] <robertmaxrees> found any tools that havbe helped?
[13:46:25] <taplar> the chrome lighthouse audit is helpful with some stuff.  other than that i've just been trolling the w3c semantic pages, some youtube a11ycast videos, and there's another document we have bookmarked on the pairing station from w3c about accessibility practices.
[13:46:45] <taplar> and we're definitely using NVDA over the windows narrator cause it's just, in our opinion, easier to use
[13:47:02] <robertmaxrees> niiiiiiiice
[13:47:19] <taplar> https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/
[13:48:03] <robertmaxrees> are you still validating against the win10 narrator occasionally still?
[13:48:24] <taplar> i'm sure we'll go back with it at some point, but not yeah, nah
[13:48:48] <taplar> i'll try to hit it with nvda, narrator, and my android
[14:13:40] <how2hack> hi guys, quick question: i'd like to manually store server requests so i can reuse the variable instead of doing a request every time, so for normal html i just store it and then .html(variable), how about a $.getScript()?
[14:14:28] <robertmaxrees> you mean store the result of getScript?
[14:14:33] <taplar> You could always store the ajax promise and any time you need the result stick a then() on it.
[14:14:39] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[14:14:41] <how2hack> can i do var js = $.getScript('url') and then what do i do with the variable js?
[14:14:52] <taplar> robert pointed that out to me , :D
[14:15:00] <robertmaxrees> >:)
[14:15:52] <how2hack> hmm i don't know much about promise, can you give me an example please?
[14:16:05] <robertmaxrees> var theCall = $.getScript('url');
[14:16:22] <robertmaxrees> theCall.then(function(theData) { console.log(theData) });
[14:16:41] <how2hack> thanks!
[14:21:49] <how2hack> hmm do i need to use eval()?
[14:22:02] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:22:18] <robertmaxrees> back up - what are you using getScript for?
[14:22:35] <robertmaxrees> and why do you care about storing the result?
[14:22:39] <how2hack> to load swal() with localized string
[14:22:51] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:22:58] <robertmaxrees> are you dynamically generating javascript?
[14:23:30] <how2hack> no, the javascript code is in a php script, i just load the required script with localized data
[14:23:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:23:43] <robertmaxrees> that's dynamically generating JS.
[14:23:53] <how2hack> didn't know that :P
[14:24:05] <robertmaxrees> you should load the actual code once and then call out for your data as needed.
[14:24:31] <how2hack> hmmm that actually looks easier
[14:24:42] <robertmaxrees> because it is.
[14:26:31] <how2hack> thanks again, code improved :)
[14:39:35] <how2hack> in jquery is there a method to easily get content from server? like getScript? but this time is not an script, it is just simple output
[14:40:24] <how2hack> or the only way is with the shorthand $.get().done(function(data) { console.log(data) })?
[14:40:27] <taplar> $.ajax
[14:40:36] <taplar> or $.get, sure
[14:41:06] <taplar> $.getScript is a wrapper around ajax, which expects a script to be returned.
[14:41:53] <how2hack> yes, i was expecting something similar, as short as $.getScript
[14:42:18] <taplar> $.get, $.post are the other wrappers
[14:43:04] <taplar> $.get('url', function(data){ console.log(data); });
[14:43:29] <how2hack> does it expect a full url? or is it ok passing just '/url'?
[14:43:37] <how2hack> that's shorter :)
[14:43:47] <taplar> it needs a 'valid' url, :)
[14:44:01] <how2hack> so, is '/url' considered a valid url?
[14:44:20] <taplar> relative urls are valid urls
[14:45:11] <how2hack> ok thanks
[17:31:33] <gambl0r3> hello?
[17:31:47] <taplar> evening
[17:35:47] <triptrap> are favicons (apple-touch-icon and the like included) properly displayed if I dynamically load them?
[17:36:53] <taplar> i would assume so, though i'm not familiar with that icon library
[17:38:17] <triptrap> what icon library?
[17:38:35] <taplar> apple-touch-icon, where ever that is coming from
[17:39:34] <triptrap> that's just some proprietary apple stuff, it's basically a shortcut icon for a tablet or phone
[17:40:04] <taplar> ah, i see.  so like: <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="152x152" href="touch-icon-ipad.png">
[17:40:48] <triptrap> I'm doing some front-end optimization, trying to minimize the number of initial requests, and I would *love* to get rid of the 5+ different icon requests at the very start of my page load
[17:41:12] <triptrap> and then just push it back to when the more essential stuff is done, but I have to make sure that they're actually processed if I dynamically load them
[17:41:34] <taplar> not sure about that.  haven't messed with much apple stuff before
[17:42:02] <taplar> you might could try to defer them though
[17:42:05] <triptrap> well, my implementation will have to be browser-agnostic
[17:42:57] <taplar> for instance: <link rel="preload" as="style" href="//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans" onload="this.rel = 'stylesheet'">
[17:43:23] <triptrap> link tags don't support defer; it's a script-specific attribute
[17:43:43] <taplar> look at that markup i just pasted
[17:43:57] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content
[17:44:31] <taplar> one of the "as" values is "image"
[17:44:35] <triptrap> that's just another way of doing what I'm already doing, although my way has more granularity
[17:46:55] <triptrap> taplar, it's good thinking though, thanks
[17:48:11] <triptrap> but I built a little boot loader that will give me the opportunity to specifically time certain events. this preload feature doesn't seem to provide much control over prioritization
[17:48:30] <taplar> what do you mean time events?
[17:49:19] <taplar> yeah, all the preload does and prevents it from blocking the page rendering
[17:49:37] <triptrap> this one project I'm working on opens with a splash animation, and I will fetch certain resources at very specific moments so as to avoid laggy animation
[17:50:20] <taplar> but you're not trying to like rely on a request taking a certain amount of time or something, right?
[17:51:26] <triptrap> no, for this specific instance I've built a sequence of greensock tweens, and I then fire certain load requests in the greensock callbacks
[17:51:43] <taplar> cool
[17:52:26] <triptrap> so I can fire it off without having to load jquery or bootstrap first, as I don't really need them yet, plus I can completely prioritize the load order
[17:53:27] <triptrap> going to ditch bootstrap anyway -- css grid is finally here to stay :)
[17:53:48] <fas3r> how can I make the following function returning the final return and not a promise https://pastebin.com/NAbyKtxk
[17:56:01] <taplar> fas3r: you might want to ask ##javascript about that one
[17:57:03] <fas3r> taplar: not really I'm using $.post
[17:57:26] <taplar> in tandem with await, which is ES6 construct, iirc
[17:59:01] <fas3r> taplar: they will ask me to come here or to use XMLHttpRequest
[17:59:56] <taplar> i'm taking a quick look at it.  $.post returns a jqXHR, and await says it is used on a Promise in an async method.  so the jqXHR may not qualify as a true blue promise, not sure.
[18:00:20] <taplar> though i would hope it would
[18:02:48] <fas3r> taplar: nevermind  I will just remove async /await and stick to .done() .fail()
[18:04:15] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/ydzLmoj1/3/  it seems to work
[18:06:59] <taplar> but i'm out, later peeps
[18:07:03] <fas3r> taplar: yes but I want to skip the .then . I want x to be the result. in your example "input"
[18:15:21] <killmenow> Hey guys
[18:15:48] <killmenow> I'm looking for something kinda specific, google brings up nothing so I was wondering if anyone could help me out with an idea/suggestion
[18:15:57] <killmenow> Basically I have a stickied fixed menu following the scroll
[18:16:22] <killmenow> This stickied fixed menu has 10 - 20 items which are completely random, their width, length, and amount is different based on what the site owner inputs
[18:16:28] <killmenow> BUT
[18:17:09] <killmenow> I need to trace the position of  the active menu item, and create an invisible "dummy" div at the top of each site section
[18:17:54] <killmenow> But this dummy should be absolute, and be at the exact spot from the left as the active menu item... I'm not sure if that makes sense
[18:18:01] <killmenow> Here's a shitty drawing
[18:18:02] <killmenow> https://imgur.com/a/4dRumbz
[18:18:25] <killmenow> So white spots are menu items, only one is active at a time
[18:18:59] <killmenow> The dummy should be at the very top of a section but be spaced from the screen edge as much as the active menu item is
[19:03:38] <Haystack78> I'm trying to copy data from one field to another.  Would something as simple as this work? $("#id1").val($("#id2").val());
[19:04:20] <pavonia> What happend when you tried?
[19:05:56] <Haystack78> the application I'm wokring on tkaes like 5 minutes to start up because of all the database operations that have to happen.  I thought I might ask here if that syntax even makes sense before I tired it out.  Apologies if I offended anybody
[19:09:06] <pavonia> It seems fine to me, but you could easily check if it works in a fiddle
[19:09:27] <Robdgreat> and nobody's offended
[19:09:41] * Robdgreat speaks for others
[19:10:44] <Haystack78> thanks everybody
[19:17:32] <killmenow> I'm offended
[19:19:57] <Robdgreat> sure, now
[19:20:06] <Robdgreat> but were you 10 minutes ago?
[19:20:17] <Robdgreat> if so, you should have spoken up then
[19:20:20] <killmenow> Yeah
[19:20:26] <killmenow> I was too offended to type
[19:20:48] <killmenow> It took me 11 minutes to muster up the courage to write this
[19:21:50] <Robdgreat> a thousand pardons
