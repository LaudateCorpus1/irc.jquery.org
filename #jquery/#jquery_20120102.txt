[00:01:29] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[00:01:45] <Eviltwin> p3rsist: Please make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[00:02:00] <p3rsist> Eviltwin: Okey Thanks
[00:02:16] <Eviltwin> Try to focus on the specific issue, don't just paste in your 10,000-line site
[00:02:38] <Eviltwin> Ideally you shouldn't need more than about a dozen lines of JavaScript
[00:08:55] <p3rsist> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/NHHty/5/
[00:11:37] <Eviltwin> Do you ever...fade it back in?
[00:12:20] <Chib> no (:
[00:12:32] <aro> is there a way with jqueryui tabs, to display the loading animation INSIDE the tab content instead of in the actual tab itself?
[00:13:14] <Eviltwin> aro: I believe you do that by setting the tab contents
[00:13:27] <aro> setting the tab contents? okay
[00:13:28] <aro> thanks!
[00:17:00] <Cork> Chib: this might be what you want? http://jsfiddle.net/NHHty/7/
[00:20:49] <aro> hey
[00:21:00] <aro> Eviltwin: i don't have 'tab contents' for those ajax tabs
[00:21:04] <aro> where do i stick it?
[00:21:48] <aro> ui-tabs-1?
[00:29:35] <Chib> p3rsist: see what Cork said (:
[00:33:04] <aro> is there a way to hide the tabs content before it has been turned into tabs?
[01:00:57] <p3rsist> Thanks guys for help
[01:10:25] <Hackwar1> hi folks, is there a simple command to reset the zoom level on an ipad?
[01:19:21] <cheshair> http://dpaste.com/680186/ this returns always false. Am I missing something trivial?
[01:20:09] <tokam> Hi I am using the Jquery cdn. Since yesterday evening it seems to be slower.
[01:20:13] <tokam> Why is that?
[01:21:51] <systemfault> jquery has a cdn?
[01:21:59] <_ikke_> mediatemple
[01:22:13] <systemfault> Ahh, didn't know :/ I always used the google one.
[01:22:54] <juha_> i think everyone should use google
[01:24:03] <systemfault> Yeah... probably faster and the file is more likely to be cached.
[01:25:06] <cheshair> After using .slideToggle(), How can I know if the current item is now visible or not?
[01:26:18] <tokam> I have a reason for not using google.
[01:26:39] <systemfault> As long as it's not ideological, it's fine.
[01:26:56] <systemfault> (and understandable)
[01:27:24] <Dr4g> Hey guys, i'm looking for some help on an open source project's jQuery autocomplete feature. I need some callback customisation.. http://www.ppi.io/  --> Start typing into the search box.
[01:27:50] <Dr4g> The XHR (ajax) request wants response.suggestions array, but i need to pack a URL with each item too.. so I can redirect the user there after they choose the item.
[01:28:18] <Dr4g> This is the autocomplete plugin i'm using. www.devbridge.com/projects/autocomplete/jquery/
[01:32:07] <Dr4g> Can someone help? :-)
[01:36:10] <systemfault> ask :/
[01:36:13] <systemfault> Ahhh
[01:38:32] <systemfault> Just create your data array (Seems like a weird plugin...)
[01:47:59] <Marko_> Guys how do I find out what is implementation of on click  event from some listener. When I do alert(document.getElementById("inputTest").click); it returnes native code even when there is no onclick
[01:48:06] <Marko_> does Jquery has something to help<
[01:48:33] <Dr4g> systemfault: do you mean 'response.data' ?
[01:49:00] <systemfault> Dr4g: I think so, I just quickly looked at how that autocomplete works
[01:49:15] <Dr4g> systemfault: yes i'm not using 'minified' yet..
[01:49:20] <systemfault> data should be an array of url I guess (With index match the results)
[01:49:36] <Dr4g> i thought this much after 10 minutes ago i done some more debugging
[01:57:20] <HardP1> guys, how can i filter all <a> tags on a page and extract ones who's text begins with @
[01:58:38] <yan_nick> ?source delegate
[01:58:39] <bot-t> Line#3522 - "delegate: function( selector, types, data, fn ) { return this.live( types, data, fn, selector ); }" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#3522
[01:59:51] <yan_nick> hey guys can anybode tell me how can i add the delegate function in jquery 1.3?
[02:00:17] <systemfault> Oh shit :/ My condolences..
[02:06:22] <Cork> heh for web irc clinets
[02:06:30] <Cork> yay for
[02:06:53] <Cork> doing delegate isn't that hard
[02:06:54] <yogurt_truck> systemfault: lol
[02:07:10] <yogurt_truck> yan_nick: let me guess: Drupal dev?
[02:08:00] <systemfault> Can't you use .live for your specific case?
[02:08:21] <yogurt_truck> .live didn't exist back then i think
[02:08:47] <yogurt_truck> oh it did
[02:10:08] <Dr4g> Hey guys, if you look at the follow jquery.autocomplete callback function of adjustScroll() which gets called from moveDown() - it updates the search field's .val() on mouse key up/down which i want to disable..
[02:10:09] <Dr4g> https://github.com/ppi/website/blob/master/scripts/jquery.autocomplete/jquery.autocomplete.js#L354
[02:10:23] <Dr4g> is it possible to override ajustScroll() to stop this ?
[02:11:19] <Dr4g> the onKeyPress callback is calling this.moveDown() and not this.options.moveDown()
[02:11:21] <Dr4g> https://github.com/ppi/website/blob/master/scripts/jquery.autocomplete/jquery.autocomplete.js#L163
[02:11:29] <Dr4g> So i don't believe it's overridable.
[02:18:40] <Dr4g> I had to comment out line #365 :(
[02:20:50] <ruby_on_tails> i have keypress and keydown both tied to an element, but keypress isnt working, is there any such rule that it wont work with keydown ?
[02:20:57] <ruby_on_tails> shouldn't both the events get triggered ?
[02:21:07] <ruby_on_tails> keypress and keyup*
[02:21:47] <Cork> i think keypress doesn't trigger on all keys, but ya, they should both work
[02:22:08] <Cork> (all keys as in muted keys)
[02:23:45] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[02:24:05] <Dr4g> ruby_on_tails: if you're using opera, use el.keypress()
[02:24:14] <ruby_on_tails> on chrome
[02:24:17] <Dr4g> otherwise el.keydown() will suffice.
[02:24:25] <ruby_on_tails> i need to be able to activate keypress on all buttons
[02:24:47] <Dr4g> on the entire page?
[02:24:50] <Dr4g> or on an element
[02:25:09] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: http://jsfiddle.net/5ts5U/
[02:26:04] <ruby_on_tails> on a text area
[02:26:06] <ruby_on_tails> checking that lin
[02:26:15] <ximarin> hi, is there an easy way to get a multiple-select to a json? <option value="val1">detVal1</option><option... /> to [{"val":"val1", "detVal":"detVal1"}, {...}]
[02:26:16] <Dr4g> Cork: dont do that! that's nasty double callback, on a global DOM element. Only one function is required.
[02:27:22] <Dr4g> ruby_on_tails: keydown is good for you on your textarea. $('textarea').keydown(function(e) {   switch(e.keyCode) { .. }   });
[02:27:35] <ruby_on_tails> Dr4g: i have keydown applied already
[02:27:42] <Dr4g> ruby_on_tails: what's the problem?
[02:27:44] <ruby_on_tails> i need to apply keypress for an artificial caret movement
[02:27:51] <Dr4g> what's caret again
[02:27:58] <ruby_on_tails> the blinking |
[02:28:01] <Dr4g> right
[02:28:12] <Dr4g> so when they type |, you trigger keypress?
[02:28:18] <Dr4g> or trigger keypress, enters a |
[02:28:33] <ruby_on_tails> on no
[02:28:37] <ruby_on_tails> the blinking |
[02:28:48] <ruby_on_tails> which shows where the new character you type will appear
[02:28:50] <ruby_on_tails> not "|"
[02:29:15] <ruby_on_tails> when you click on a blank text input a caret appears
[02:29:21] <Dr4g> yes
[02:29:24] <ruby_on_tails> keydown does an ajax request to save the text, if i put the caret code there 1. caret doesnt move on long arrow hits, 2. excess ajax load
[02:29:59] <Dr4g> ruby_on_tails: ok, then i'm not sure - try posting on stack overflow.. gotta go, good luck
[02:30:12] <ruby_on_tails> Dr4g: np, thanks
[02:33:32] <Dr4g> ruby_on_tails: i had an idea..
[02:33:43] <Dr4g> nvm that wouldn't work x)
[02:33:47] <ruby_on_tails> :D
[02:33:48] <ruby_on_tails> np
[02:33:56] <Dr4g> seems like the client wants a fancy blinking char coz they're used to MSWord.
[02:34:11] <Dr4g> Just stick with the native functionality of the browser's DOM element.
[02:34:35] <Dr4g> and don't try to hack around it. You're just wasting needless coding hours.
[02:34:38] * Dr4g gone
[02:38:06] <ruby_on_tails> google doc does it
[02:38:12] <ruby_on_tails> i am making something for collaborative editing
[02:38:17] <ruby_on_tails> so need to show multiple carets
[02:38:24] <ruby_on_tails> which should obviously move
[02:39:57] <Dr4g> ruby_on_tails: ok then ur excused :)
[02:40:05] <ruby_on_tails> haha
[02:40:20] <ruby_on_tails> i inspected google docs, they are using some really complex/weird logic
[02:40:37] <ruby_on_tails> they are absolutely positioning a div, god knows how
[02:41:46] <zitter> can I bind :checked with live() ?
[02:42:01] <zitter> checked/uncheked
[02:43:12] <Cork> haven't tested, but i think so
[02:49:20] <zitter> ok, it works. but it works only if I change value becuase of live("change",function() I would like to copy at first with default value on textbox. Focus doens't work. Any hint?
[02:53:05] <zitter> sorry for messup code http://pastie.org/3111618 #Vehicle_assuredIsOwner is a checkbox. When checked it has to copy value. I've done with code in row 6. Is there another way?
[02:56:12] <xec> zitter: your comment says "copy value from Assured_name to Owner_name" but the code does the opposite, as far as i can tell
[02:57:36] <zitter> yes, sorry for that. the point is that I would like to copy using live()
[02:59:07] <emx> how do i remove the first element in a $( cssSelector )-result?
[02:59:34] <emx> (or how do i select all cssSelector but the first one?)
[02:59:53] <systemfault> Hmm
[02:59:54] <xec> what is your current selector?
[03:00:01] <systemfault> Perhaps that .slice(1) would work
[03:00:21] <emx> .class
[03:00:41] <emx> i guess slice() is the simplest one. thanks.
[03:00:58] <systemfault> You're welcome
[03:11:07] <zitter> solved in this way: http://pastie.org/3111675 JQuery is cool, but I'm not :(
[03:29:18] <Marko_> Guys how to find out if jquery object has onclick attached or not
[03:37:40] <Deafgoose> I have the following selector $("div[id^='post-'] div.entry-content").html() however inside div.entry-content theres a div.class that I would like to exclude from this selector, how would I go about doing this?
[03:51:49] <Marko_> Guys how do I find out what is implementation of on click  event from some listener. When I do alert(document.getElementById("inputTest").onclick); it returnes native code even when there is no onclick
[03:55:45] <eugenmayer> is there a way ( with 1.3 ) to find the "col header" using jquery? the html definition is using thead, but what about the dom represenation?
[03:56:01] <ablomen> thead
[03:56:15] <yogurt_truck> those damned theads
[03:57:15] <eugenmayer> ablomen: so the classic way, $('table thead th').each(..for every col )
[03:57:16] <eugenmayer> ?
[03:57:22] <ablomen> yes
[03:57:25] <eugenmayer> Thank you
[04:04:24] <Deafgoose> I have the following selector $("div[id^='post-'] div.entry-content").html() however inside div.entry-content theres a div.class that I would like to exclude from this selector, how would I go about doing this?
[04:06:27] <Peeter> Deafgoose: :not selector
[04:08:13] <Deafgoose> div[class^='entry-content']:not('div.classtoexclude') ?
[04:11:44] <rzec> let say I attach an event to 'keydown.namespace', is there a way to detect whether or not an event already exist on the event+namespace combination?
[04:11:58] <Peeter> More or less ye Deafgoose
[04:12:39] <Peeter> Ye rzec
[04:12:53] <Peeter> Do you use .live, .bind or .delegate ?
[04:13:07] <rzec> in this case I am using .bind
[04:13:45] <Peeter> To get the vents binded to that object, just use $(selector).data('events');
[04:16:27] <Marko_> Guys does jquery store informations about onclick listener for element<
[04:16:32] <Marko_> i need to find it out
[04:24:09] <gnagno> hello all
[04:25:57] <gnagno> my jquery script receives this json from the server: http://pastie.org/3111976 how can I add the content of comuni to a select?
[04:34:31] <eric357> How can I make jquery be loaded by the browser before my jquery-dependent custom code is loaded?
[04:35:55] <Cork> eric357: include it before your code in the page
[04:36:21] <eric357> my code starts with $(document).ready( function () {  and the browser promptly throws and "unexpected end of input" error
[04:36:41] <Cork> thats something else
[04:36:47] <Cork> thats a parser error
[04:37:11] <eric357> Cork: I have jquery included in the header and my custom code in the footer
[04:37:58] <Cork> ?p @ eric357
[04:37:59] <bot-t1> eric357, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:38:53] <RLa> eric357, is that wordpress?
[04:38:55] <eric357>  It's here: the code is here: http://pastebin.com/XTcP6Qfb but I can move it
[04:39:25] <eric357> RLa: no, actually just php with CodeIgniter
[04:39:48] <RLa> wordpress bans $ usage
[04:39:54] <Cork> eric357: i didn't meant the js
[04:40:03] <Cork> the js doesn't generate that kind of errors
[04:40:07] <Cork> its a parser error
[04:40:13] <Cork> try w3c validate
[04:40:57] <eric357> Cork: oh!  I see... here I thought the js was bad or something
[04:44:48] <Dr4g> how to stop the window.location.hash anchor from activating ?/
[04:45:08] <Dr4g> I want to scroll to a custom position, and i think the browser's default is overriding me (only sometimes, RACE condition?)
[04:49:50] <nicholasschulz> take a look at the scrollto plugin
[04:54:52] <Dr4g> nicholasschulz: i'm using it !
[04:55:02] <Dr4g> check here: http://www.ppi.io/api/show/PPI_Controller#m-hasPost
[04:55:03] <nicholasschulz> oh ok
[04:55:22] <Dr4g> it goes to isPost(), but it is actually hitting hasPost() but the Topbar is covering it.
[04:55:41] <Dr4g> So if you see my Javascript http://www.ppi.io/scripts/api.js
[04:57:02] <Dr4g> I'm subtracting 70px from the offset to bring it up the page.
[04:57:08] <Dr4g> but it's not firing ?
[04:59:26] <jQueryNoob> heya folks => i've got a quick question. Is there a way in jQuery i can create a sorted collection of some type?
[04:59:59] <Cork> jQueryNoob: collection of what?
[05:00:27] <jQueryNoob> right now.. i have a a bunch of divs etc. i'm manually going to use .each to go through em
[05:00:39] <jQueryNoob> and look for a particular value in some element.
[05:00:47] <jQueryNoob> i just wish to add that value to a sortable collection
[05:00:59] <Cork> array then
[05:01:00] <jQueryNoob> so i can then sort my ui divs
[05:01:05] <xarxer> Hellu.. Is it possible to use $("#comment_" + identifier) to choose element with a variable as a part of the name?
[05:01:08] <jQueryNoob> so i can sort an array?
[05:01:20] <Cork> xarxer: yes
[05:01:26] <xarxer> Cork: hmmm
[05:01:33] <xarxer> Then there's something else that's wrong..
[05:01:47] <Cork> jQueryNoob: array has .sort yes
[05:01:57] <jQueryNoob> oh *blush*
[05:02:14] <Cork> ?mdc array sort
[05:02:19] <bot-t1> Cork, sort - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Sorts the elements of an array in place. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[05:03:15] <jQueryNoob> @cork cheers mate.
[05:10:31] <lxsameer> how can i select tags that their id property starts with "debug_"
[05:16:39] <tcurdt> traversal question ... when I have: $('.page').each(function(i, el) { ... });
[05:16:58] <tcurdt> what's the easiest way to get the prev and next element on each iteration
[05:18:31] <ruby_on_tails> tcurdt: tru $(this).next() and $(this).prev()
[05:18:35] <ruby_on_tails> inside the loop
[05:18:51] <tcurdt> uh! awesome
[05:19:06] <tcurdt> thanks! will give that a try
[05:27:25] <gnarf> tcurdt: you mean the next match for .page ?
[05:28:08] <tcurdt> gnarf: yes ... just tried this in a fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/GsCkF/ ...but it's not quite right
[05:28:14] <gnarf> var pages = $('.page'); pages.each( function( index, element ) { pages.eq( index - 1 ) } );
[05:28:46] <Cork> uh... why .eq?
[05:29:03] <Cork> just do $(this).next()
[05:29:12] <Cork> opps sorry
[05:29:15] <gnarf> Cork: if the .page's are right in a row, sure
[05:29:16] <Cork> scratch that :)
[05:30:03] <gnarf> also, careful cuz .eq(-1) will give you the last element
[05:30:05] <gnarf> but
[05:30:13] <gnarf> .eq( length ) will give you nothing
[05:30:15] <gnarf> so like
[05:30:16] <gnarf> yeah
[05:30:40] <tcurdt> gnarf: ah ... ok ... but this works http://jsfiddle.net/GsCkF/1/
[05:30:51] <tcurdt> oh ... wait .. no
[05:31:10] <Cork> i would prob use for() instead of each
[05:31:18] <Cork> less overhead as you don't use it anyway
[05:32:03] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/GsCkF/2/
[05:32:19] <Cork> bah forgot a parantes
[05:32:43] <gnarf> Cork: now you have issues with prevEl and nextEl if you ever reference them in a closure function or whatever
[05:33:18] <Cork> gnagno: eq is zero based
[05:33:34] <gnarf> of course it is
[05:33:57] <tcurdt> hence the valid remark of gnarf about the .eq(-1)
[05:34:12] <Cork> ah, sorry ya, now i get you
[05:34:37] <gnarf> var prev = i ? pages.eq(i-1) : $(), next = pages.eq(i+1);
[05:34:48] <Cork> tcurdt: na it was about closure, i miss understood his remark
[05:35:21] <tcurdt> gnarf: can you elaborate about the closures - don't see the difference yet
[05:35:29] <tcurdt> in regards to closures
[05:35:36] <gnarf> tcurdt: for loops don't scope vars
[05:35:43] <Cork> tcurdt: .each has an inline function, for doesn't
[05:35:54] <gnarf> so like var prevEl and nextEl in cork's example are scoped to the "outer" scope
[05:36:07] <Cork> its what makes for faster, but its also has that drawback
[05:36:09] <gnarf> so if you were say, binding something on each element
[05:36:21] <gnarf> and wanted to reference the prev/next shit
[05:36:22] <tcurdt> that's what I was going to
[05:36:27] <gnarf> it would be wrong in the bound function
[05:36:59] <Cork> haven't prefed how much .each cost so its prob the best solution then :)
[05:37:17] <gnarf> so like
[05:37:18] <tcurdt> interesting ... I thought the scope would be the same because both have the "var" inside the loop ... guess I was wrong :)
[05:37:31] <gnarf> tcurdt: function's create scopes
[05:37:42] <gnarf> nothing (that you're prolly using) else does
[05:37:51] <tcurdt> *nod*
[05:38:00] <gnarf> also - Cork - re perf cost of .each()
[05:38:22] <gnarf> if you are worried about the perf of .each over a for loop, its probably something that you run a LOT
[05:38:45] <gnarf> in newer engines anyway, function executions aren't that expensive
[05:38:53] <tcurdt> performance is not an issue for me here
[05:39:13] <tcurdt> just trying to find a nice way to access the prev and the next element in the loop
[05:39:33] <gnarf> tcurdt: var prev = i ? pages.eq(i-1) : $(), next = pages.eq(i+1); will prolly work
[05:40:08] <Cork> gnarf: i would prob say = i > 0 ?
[05:40:13] <Cork> its more expressive and easier to read
[05:40:37] <tcurdt> gnarf: indeed it does
[05:40:57] <tcurdt> not as nice as I hoped but... ok :)
[05:41:09] <gnarf> tcurdt: not something you often need really...
[05:41:51] <tcurdt> TBH ... I need that quite often ... not just in js
[05:42:00] <tcurdt> but everything is relative :)
[05:42:19] <Marko_> yogurt_truck:  Hi still here? I have speudo code if I uncomment the commented line  listener does now work why? http://jsfiddle.net/68Nxh/
[05:43:35] <gnarf> Marko_: so like .html() does .empty() then appends new html
[05:43:41] <gnarf> so it unbinds any listeners on elements inside
[05:44:13] <Marko_> gnarf: ok so, if I need to change something with html  - i need to rename Ids and do some other stuff but I want listener to staz what should I do?
[05:44:24] <gnarf> you might want to consider using delegated events on the container instead
[05:44:35] <Marko_> what do you mean?

[05:45:16] <gnarf> so like instead of binding an event on the actual form inputs
[05:45:21] <gnarf> you can bind to the container
[05:45:33] <soee> hi, how can i add some style for each list element inside some container ?
[05:45:46] <gnarf> $(".container").delegate("input.something", "change", fn )
[05:46:30] <gnarf> if you're using jQuery 1.7, you should use .on() instead
[05:46:39] <gnarf> in which case its .on( event, selector, fn )
[05:47:10] <Marko_> gnarf:  yes and  what is container ? element which to which listener is attached to?
[05:47:30] <gnarf> Marko_: i dunno, some element in the parent chain
[05:47:33] <gnarf> that everything shares
[05:47:42] <gnarf> maybe the form iteself?
[05:47:44] <gnarf> perhaps a div?
[05:47:52] <gnarf> whatever it is doesn't make a ton of difference
[05:48:13] <Marko_> gnarf:  what I worry is that if it will stay independed of element, thats whz clone is great.
[05:48:34] <Marko_> I don't know for sure the structure of element I will clone or type of its listeners
[05:48:49] <gnarf> Marko_: sounds like a design flaw then
[05:49:03] <Marko_> gnarf: not really, it should it independent and reusable
[05:51:26] <Marko_> so I am not sure how does independce from element is design flaw
[05:52:09] <gnarf> Marko_: delegated events basically solve that problem for you, but like don't be using .html() to change something when you have better options
[05:52:15] <gnarf> .clone() can copy events
[05:52:25] <gnarf> just don't blow them up
[05:52:43] <gnarf> .html() is like a sledgehammer when you need an exacto knife
[05:52:46] <Marko_> unfortunally can't change that..
[05:53:42] <gnarf> Marko_: unfortunately i can't help then i guess
[05:53:54] <gnarf> maybe if you actually like stated a problem
[05:53:58] <Marko_> gnarf: delegeta will be element depend wont it, how to write sedlector otherwise...
[05:54:42] <snagnever> hi! i know it's not a jquery-related error, but i'm having a strange behavior on chrome when trying to access an object; http://pastelog.com.br/?q=1344
[05:54:56] <Marko_> or am I wrong gnarf>
[05:54:57] <Marko_> ?
[05:55:01] <snagnever> the object is defined, but it says it's not; it works fine on IE and FF
[05:55:21] <gnarf> snagnever: did you try console.log( status ) ?
[05:55:35] <gnarf> Marko_: i dunno, hard to read past all the typos ;)
[05:55:44] <snagnever> gnarf: it's [object] but status.tipos it says undefined
[05:55:54] <gnarf> snagnever: [object]?
[05:56:01] <gnarf> snagnever: are you using alert() to debug?
[05:56:07] * gnarf prepares to slap someone with a trout
[05:56:07] <snagnever> no, console.debug
[05:56:30] <gnarf> console.log( status ) - doesn't give you a tree you can navigate?
[05:56:37] <gnarf> an object with properties?
[05:56:40] <snagnever> [object Object]
[05:56:42] <gnarf> perhaps something else is status
[05:56:54] <gnarf> snagnever: sounds like someone tried adding a string to the object...
[05:56:56] <Marko_> gnarf You know what I mean. If i use delegate, it won't be general and I won't be able to pass it any part of dom.
[05:57:29] <snagnever> gnarf let me double check... but it works fine on ff and ie
[05:57:31] <gnarf> Marko_: exactly wtf are you doing that you need to pass it "any part of dom"
[05:57:50] <Marko_> cloning elements
[05:59:02] * gnarf sighs
[05:59:07] <gnarf> then just clone them
[05:59:13] <gnarf> it wont destroy listeners
[05:59:45] <Marko_> I know but unfort. I have to use html actually it's not even my code and I can't redo it at least , not the html part.
[05:59:54] <snagnever> gnarf yeah, it's somethign about the variable name, but only on chrome. it becomes a string for some reason
[06:01:29] <snagnever> gnarf thx, solved
[06:01:35] <snagnever> changed from 'status' to 'info' hehehe
[06:03:05] <gnarf> i'm so sick of that excuse - if its a problem, don't frickin use it - rewrite the bad code, or fix the bad plugin, or redesign it in such a way that it wont fail
[06:03:48] <gnarf> Marko_: ^^
[06:03:54] <Marko_> gnarf: not possible in kind of project I am working on and with amount of code that would need to be change.
[06:04:02] <gnarf> Marko_: sorry to head
[06:04:06] <gnarf> hear
[06:04:14] <Marko_> tell me about it, I am redoing someone else code.
[06:05:20] <Marko_> solution is not that bad actually gnarf , I will just make client responsible to add listeners after clonning.
[06:15:54] <soee> how can i put some text in firebug console ?
[06:16:38] <ravenzz> console.log()
[06:16:54] <ravenzz> `ftj @ soee
[06:17:02] <ravenzz> ?ftj @ soee
[06:17:15] <ravenzz> no bawt
[06:20:07] <BinaryKitten> gnarf, Marko_  i understand the pain there.. I've recently had to redo a spaghetti code from someone else. over 5000 lines in 1 js file and the system still didn't do it right
[06:21:38] <Marko_> BinaryKitten: ouch
[06:23:31] <BinaryKitten> yep definitely
[06:23:44] * BinaryKitten returns to work.
[06:30:36] <soee> how can i do somethin on selected elements only if they dont have XYZ class ?
[06:31:26] <BinaryKitten> $(selector).not('.class').doSomething
[06:31:29] <JKarsrud> ?not
[06:31:37] <BinaryKitten> bot's not here
[06:31:40] <JKarsrud> meh
[06:31:44] <JKarsrud> screw you bot-t
[06:31:50] <BinaryKitten> need to get a bot-t backup
[06:31:56] <JKarsrud> never here when I need him :(
[06:33:42] <soee> BinaryKitten, $(this).not(".separator") should return true or false ?
[06:34:06] <xec> no, it should return jquery collection
[06:34:16] <anticom> hi all
[06:34:37] <xec> if you want true/false, try .is()
[06:34:38] <Raydiation> is there a good way how to handle keyboard shortcuts? accesskeys
[06:34:48] <anticom> i've got an jq ui dialog wrapped into a function and i want that function to return certain things depending on what button was pressed
[06:34:55] <soee> xec, and how can i check i selected list item has some class or not ?
[06:34:58] <anticom> http://pastebin.com/wHP9Y2da (line 11 and 15)
[06:35:21] <anticom> but i'm always getting "undefined" back :/
[06:35:26] <anticom> any ideas on how to solve that?
[06:35:26] <xec> soee: with .is() - like: if($(this).is(".class"))
[06:35:52] <anticom> soee either .attr("class") or .class()
[06:36:05] <ravenzz> soee hasClass
[06:36:13] <Raydiation> yeah, hasClass
[06:36:29] <xec> hasClass works too
[06:36:59] <soee> do if i want to check if element doesnt have class i do: if(!$(this).hasClass(".class")) ?
[06:37:02] <soee> *so
[06:37:07] <xec> right
[06:37:57] <anticom> is there even a solution for my problem? :/
[06:38:40] <atxq> what would be a common way to count all the words inside an element, without counting the tags?
[06:39:13] <Raydiation> anticom: paste code pls
[06:39:24] <anticom> <anticom>http://pastebin.com/wHP9Y2da (line 11 and 15)
[06:39:40] <atxq> is there a better way than using $(this).length; in some way?
[06:40:17] <anticom> atxq why don't you split the string by " " (space) and count the number of elements in the array?
[06:40:32] <anticom> that would count the words instead of each letter
[06:40:52] <anticom> you could apply some map functions to filter empty elements and so on
[06:40:58] <anticom> or further split them on line breaks
[06:41:31] <atxq> makes sense spliting the string into an array, but is there a built-in function in jquery to handle this?
[06:41:42] <anticom> atxq even better
[06:41:46] <anticom> native js function ;)
[06:42:18] <anticom> http://www.tizag.com/javascriptT/javascript-string-split.php
[06:42:37] <atxq> thanks anticom, got to love the js fallback
[06:42:46] <shadykhan> what can i do to test my javascript/jquery skills?
[06:42:46] <anticom> that's the real power of jq
[06:42:52] <anticom> you can combine it any time
[06:43:05] <anticom> shadykhan help me with my project lol
[06:43:06] <anticom> jk
[06:43:09] <shadykhan> lol
[06:43:32] <anticom> shadykhan http://www.google.de/search?q=test+jquery+skills&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:de:official&client=firefox-a
[06:44:09] <Raydiation> anticom: how about passing a callback function to the button functions
[06:44:18] <Raydiation> anticom: altough i think that the dialog code just creates the dialog and binds the callbacks
[06:44:39] <soee> guys take a look: http://pastebin.com/4ZCx2uiX i want to have only elements that are no separatros but i have all list items always here
[06:45:17] <anticom> Raydiation could you set up a quick jsfiddle example please? i can't follow your thoughts :/
[06:46:29] <tokam> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.1.min.js
[06:46:34] <tokam> this does not work with https
[06:46:41] <tokam> Gateway timeout
[06:47:22] <anticom> tokam use google hotlink instead
[06:47:25] <anticom> that should work
[06:47:51] <anticom> or just download it :D
[06:48:42] <atxq> anticom, your suggestion would could the tags too, right?
[06:49:04] <anticom> what?
[06:49:24] <atxq> I need to strip the tags from the html() before split()
[06:49:47] <anticom> why are you looking at the whole html stuff when you only want to count the text?
[06:50:10] <anticom> atxq http://api.jquery.com/text/
[06:50:15] <atxq> seems like <img gets a count, as does alt="".
[06:50:30] <atxq> so instead of html() use text()?
[06:50:57] <anticom> if you want text use .text(), if you want html use .html()
[06:51:04] <anticom> depends on what exactly you want
[06:51:11] <atxq> thanks
[06:51:57] <eric357> Cork: et al: found my silly parser error - was missing the  ");" at the end of the script - *face palm*
[06:52:52] <atxq> yeah, html() returns 1000+, while text() returns 45. neither are right
[06:55:44] <anticom> dialog won't even show up in jsfiddle :O http://jsfiddle.net/BjSwz/1/
[06:56:02] <atxq> somehow $(this).text().split(" ").length; returns the wrong count
[06:56:05] <anticom> eric357 notepad++? :D
[06:56:28] <anticom> atxq it doesn't handle double spaces and linebreaks right
[06:56:47] <anticom> i'd store $(this).text().split() in a variable and perform various map functions with it
[06:56:53] <anticom> before counting
[06:57:25] <atxq> I am thinking that it is taking into account the img tags, etc.
[06:57:26] <eric357> anticom: no... actually a cut/paste error in vim
[06:57:33] <anticom> Raydiation http://jsfiddle.net/BjSwz/1/ :/
[06:58:45] <atxq> I am thinking that I need to strip out all tags before .length in order to get the correct count
[06:59:27] <tcurdt> hm ... what's wrong with doing: $('.swipe').each(function(i, el) { el.live("...", function() { ...
[06:59:38] <tcurdt> getting HTMLDivElement has no method 'live'
[07:01:10] <tcurdt> I think I know what's wrong ... but I am surprised
[07:01:38] <ravenz> $(el).live()
[07:02:08] <tcurdt> thanks, ravenz
[07:02:31] <ravenz> or just do $('.swipe').live()
[07:02:42] <JKarsrud> if you'
[07:02:45] <JKarsrud> oops
[07:02:55] <JKarsrud> if you're using 1.7, use .on() instead
[07:02:57] <atxq> so $(this).text() return text+ a bunch of line breaks. how can I get rid of the line breaks?
[07:03:23] <JKarsrud> split on \n?
[07:03:30] <tcurdt> ravenz: in this very case I need to iterate ... but thanks for the pointer
[07:03:36] <ravenz> k
[07:04:18] <atxq> split("\n")? I need regex, right?
[07:04:24] <anticom> atxq http://www.tizag.com/javascriptT/javascript-string-replace.php
[07:04:46] <anticom> don't forget to escape the backslash
[07:06:11] <ravenz> foo.replace(/\n\r/g/,' ');
[07:06:27] <ravenz> - the last /
[07:06:34] <ravenz> foo.replace(/\n\r/g,' ');
[07:06:35] <atxq> $(this).replace(/(\r\n|\n|\r)/gm,"");?
[07:07:19] <atxq> thanks guys
[07:08:55] <NoiseEee> on jqueryui droppables, what's makes something droppable on a specific region?  the x/y of the mouse or the x/y of the helper?
[07:10:05] <NoiseEee> "This event is triggered when an accepted draggable is dropped 'over' (within the tolerance of) this droppable."
[07:15:14] <NoiseEee> FYI, the answer is apparently http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/#option-tolerance
[07:31:13] <atxq> just wondering, is there a way to convert html() to text() and vice verses?
[07:32:27] <atxq> so $(this).html().text() should be possible, right?
[07:32:50] <atxq> not practical, but possible, right?
[07:35:29] <xec> atxq: not quite
[07:35:39] <xec> atxq: .html() will return a string
[07:36:01] <Dunstkreis> yes, was my first though too ! :)
[07:36:15] <xec> atxq: and you can't call .text() on a string
[07:36:19] <xec> would be my guess
[07:37:25] <xec> atxq: what are you trying to achieve with this?
[07:38:31] <atxq> just trying to figure out a practical way to remove only the tags from html()
[07:39:55] <atxq> sp <span>text</span> becomes text, img, hr, etc. disappear complete and only the text would remain
[07:40:31] <xec> doesnt .text() do that?
[07:41:48] <xec> atxq: maybe demonstrate your issue at jsfiddle.net if you want us to take a look
[07:44:09] <atxq> I basically want to string out all html elements, but was wondering if it can be done after calling html()
[07:44:25] <xec> why do you call .html()
[07:44:47] <xec> and by "string" i assume you mean "strip"
[07:45:02] <atxq> strip*, sorry
[07:45:37] <atxq> let me see if I can think of a practical situation
[07:46:51] <xec> i just don't see why you would call .html() if you don't want the html.
[07:47:29] <xec> however, if you already have a html string as input, and want to strip out the tags you could take a look at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5002111/javascript-how-to-strip-html-tags-from-string
[07:49:27] <xec> atxq: i think maybe all you want is $(this).text()
[07:51:51] <atxq> innerText makes sense. was more asking to see if there is a built-in function for this type of thing in jquery
[07:52:18] <xec> well..yes. .text() ....
[07:53:00] <atxq> more of a text() alternative for strings I guess
[07:53:25] <xec> did you read the link i gave you? $("<p>Hello, <b>World</b></p>").text()
[07:53:37] <xec> returns "Hello, World"
[07:54:22] <atxq> yeah, but was looking at the top example where they used js
[07:54:43] <anticom> anyone familiar with dynatree here?
[07:55:25] <xec> anticom: nope, but if you ask your question maybe someone will take a shot at it ;)
[07:55:41] <anticom> xec i want to edit the title of an existing onde
[07:55:43] <anticom> node*
[07:55:45] <_ramo1> hi
[07:55:54] <anticom> and the documentation doesn't say wether node.data.title is read only or not :/
[07:56:00] <anticom> i've tried it that way and failed
[07:56:56] <anticom> xec http://wwwendt.de/tech/dynatree/doc/dynatree-doc.html#h8.3
[07:57:12] <anticom> and there is no setter method for it >.<
[07:57:24] <anticom> or i'm simply blind
[07:57:26] <anticom> OOPS
[07:57:30] <anticom> got it :>
[07:57:37] <xec> :D
[07:57:39] <anticom> ctrl + f ...made my day :D
[07:57:58] <anticom> was scrolling till my fingers bleed but never thought of searching for setTitle() :D
[07:58:35] <xec> on the other hand, look at http://wwwendt.de/tech/dynatree/doc/dynatree-doc.html#h8.4.4
[07:58:51] <xec> it says you can set node.data.title and then node.render()
[07:59:00] <anticom> yea
[07:59:12] <anticom> but i've got another question concerning the nodes themself
[07:59:19] <anticom> maybe you can answer it straight away
[07:59:33] <xec> probably not
[07:59:42] <anticom> since jq objects have the data() method, does that apply for the nodes generated by that tree too?
[08:00:00] <anticom> i need to find a possibility to append data to the nodes
[08:04:19] <atxq> okay, so I want to strip out all the style and script tags on a return html().
[08:04:51] <atxq> I found that calling text() keeps the style data
[08:05:18] <atxq> and text(0 also keeps the js/jquery data
[08:07:14] <atxq> so I am think that I have to apply remove() to the html()
[08:07:26] <xec> atxq: maybe you can remove style and script before you do .text()
[08:07:35] <_ramo1> i'm using the autocomplete from jquer UI . in my repsone i get someting like {'productlabel', 'productid'}, but somehow in the autocompletion both is shown... the productlabel and the productid seperately.. i would like ot have the productlabel as alink with the productid as a parameter
[08:08:05] <xec> atxq: maybe something like .find(":not(style)") could work?
[08:08:19] <seutje> having a rly weird issue, throws an error saying a method isn't defined, but if I log it, it gives me the function
[08:09:11] <seutje> like http://pastie.org/3113039 but I guess that's not very helpful
[08:09:36] <tcurdt> I am using iscroll4 with jquery mobile. The page div has a jquery swipe event handler and all works fine. Now with iscroll4 on the page the problem is that the page div also gets the swipe event while iscroll should consume that event.
[08:09:54] <JKarsrud> seutje: wth, that'
[08:09:59] <JKarsrud> that looks weird
[08:10:25] <danzik17> seutje: pastebin or jsfiddle the code that's causing it.
[08:10:40] <JKarsrud> and self is the same in bot places amirite? I'm guessing those two lines are like that in the code as well, yeah?
[08:10:51] <atxq> so after removing the style/script tags, I want to strip out the remaining html tags. any suggestions?
[08:10:52] <tcurdt> how does a child div prevent events to bubble up?
[08:10:54] <JKarsrud> both*
[08:11:18] <JKarsrud> tcurdt: http://jqapi.com/#p=event.stopPropagation
[08:12:23] <seutje> http://pastie.org/3113055
[08:12:38] <seutje> JKarsrud: it's subsequent lines
[08:12:50] <seutje> and it worked before
[08:12:53] <seutje> afaik
[08:13:05] <pom> How can I get a function to call itself when it is done when it resides in jquery scope, like this: http://pastie.org/3113058
[08:13:31] <pom> Just getting not defined however I try to reference it.
[08:15:23] <danzik17> pom: don't use the eval form of setTimeout - use an actual function
[08:15:27] <mike817> i've got a console.log that isn't firing, but an ajax request immediately afterwards is.  any idea why?
[08:15:50] <seutje> pom: why not just use setInterval?
[08:16:07] <snover> ?g setinterval harmful @ seutje
[08:16:16] <snover> oh, no bot-t
[08:16:16] <snover> well
[08:16:20] <snover> seutje you know what to do!
[08:16:20] <seutje> leaks?
[08:16:42] <danzik17> setInterval swallows stack traces or something if i remember correctly?  forget the exact reason.
[08:17:05] <seutje> I see
[08:17:06] <snover> no, it has the potential to break all your world
[08:17:08] <pom> seutje: setInterval just keeps calling the function even if it fails or whatever, so it doesn't let me have the same control.
[08:17:14] <snover> over and over again
[08:17:33] <snover> catastrophically if you are trying to use it to poll for something
[08:17:41] <danzik17> snover: ah yea that makes more sense.  read about it a long time ago and haven't used it since - forgot why though.
[08:18:09] <snover> it isn’t even good for animation anymore, I should update that article
[08:22:31] <pom> danzik17: When I don't enclose the function name the timeout isn't enforced. It calls the function immediately.
[08:23:27] <danzik17> pom: don't add parens after the function name.  that's executing the function, you just want a reference to it.  setTimeout( switcher, 1000 )
[08:25:24] <danzik17> seutje: btw, i'm assuming you're calling new Drupal.behavior.scrollMenu?  if so, those functions should be on the prototype for the object, not the object itself
[08:26:31] <anticom> if i've selected some elements already can i use data without having to specify the elemnts again?
[08:26:42] <pom> danzik17: There we go. Thanks.
[08:26:42] <anticom> like $("selection").data(key, val)
[08:27:49] <danzik17> anticom: yes.
[08:27:53] <atxq_> since text() remove only the script and style tags, but not the data itself, I am having a problem
[08:28:14] <anticom> thx danzik17
[08:28:19] <mike817> i have a form which i'm validating and then submitting through form.submit().  is there a way to preserve the original submit button?
[08:28:54] <seutje> danzik17: Drupal.behaviors is iterated and they're all being called passing in the context of whatever it needs to be attached to
[08:28:58] <atxq_> so I want to get the html(), remove the style and script tags, then convert everything to text so I can count the words. Any ideas?
[08:29:24] <seutje> danzik17: why shouldn't they be on the object? there's only 1
[08:29:48] <seutje> but the error somehow went away
[08:29:59] <seutje> didn't even chhange anything, I'm going nuts
[08:30:39] <NoiseEee> anyone know if it's possible to use jqueryui autocomplete on an array of objects, or with data like http://jsfiddle.net/sGJNq/ (ie: nested)?  I can format the data to match autocomplete's limitations, etc...
[08:30:40] <seutje> think I need a break, thanks for the help guys! <3
[08:31:00] <NoiseEee> ie: search for "fluffy" or "rexie"
[08:33:38] <danzik17> seutje: if it's only 1 then that's fine.  its hard to tell the intended usage from just this example
[08:42:11] <min|dvir|us> I want to use the jQuery cycle plugin with a custom effect. How?
[08:42:25] <min|dvir|us> I tried overwriting fxFn but that doesn't seem to get read.
[08:43:22] <Dunstkreis> mike817, what do you mean with "preserve" ?
[08:44:29] <pom> Can I load an image from a server and only continue when the data has been fetched successfully with Image()?
[08:44:37] <Guest23761> Anyone else having problems with jQueryUI Buttons? - It keeps poping the error: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'button'.
[08:50:24] <anticom> http://wwwendt.de/tech/dynatree/doc/dynatree-doc.html#h8.4.3 that doesn't work without throwing any error :O
[08:51:40] <Guest> Can anyone help me with a jQeuryUI button problem? http://jsfiddle.net/eh6Nm/ <- It throws and error every time
[08:52:29] <NoiseEee> anyone know if it's possible to use jqueryui autocomplete with data like http://jsfiddle.net/sGJNq/ (ie: nested)?  I can format the data to match autocomplete's limitations, etc...
[08:55:09] <mike817> Dunstkreis: the submit button name and id
[08:55:22] <mike817> using form.submit() replaces that
[08:55:44] <anticom> NoiseEee see "Source Code" http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#default
[08:55:52] <anticom> "View Source" *
[08:56:03] <Dunstkreis> k, and you wanna hold the values for the next loaded page?
[08:56:37] <anticom> Guest what do you want to do?
[08:56:42] <mike817> i want to capture the submit click values before it gets replaced
[08:57:35] <anticom> Guest assuming this: http://jsfiddle.net/eh6Nm/1/
[08:57:38] <anticom> have to go
[08:57:39] <anticom> bb all (:
[08:57:41] <anticom> happy coding
[08:59:15] <pom> I'm trying to fade in an image below a <h1>. During the fadeIn() the <h1> dissappears for a moment. Anyone got a clue what is wrong? You can see for yourself here: http://dev.pomle.com/
[08:59:39] <Dunstkreis> mike817 i dont get the problem, you've got a form select it and add the handler!? $('form').submit( function() { ...do whatever you want, and return true to continue or false to cancel ...} );
[09:03:02] <NackNick> is it possible to remove a element within a iframe?
[09:03:46] <NackNick> for example im trying to remove all images within a iframe
[09:05:04] <NoiseEee> only if it obeys SOP, NackNick
[09:05:27] <NackNick> how do i check for that?
[09:09:03] <Eviltwin> ?sop @ NackNick

[09:13:31] <mgie> hi
[09:13:54] <NoiseEee> looking for ideas based on http://jsfiddle.net/sGJNq/1/ ... trying to find a way to move 'found' items <article>s in the autocomplete to the top of #holder;  not even sure ui autocomplete is the way to go, versus parsing info about each <article> itself on the fly?
[09:15:01] <Guest> Sorry - suddenly had several people at my door. lol - anticom : I wanted to make use of the jQuery UI to style my button elements- however it throws an error each try I try.
[09:16:17] <NoiseEee> ie: user types "1" and <article id='job_104'> and <article id='job_106'> move to the top of #holder
[09:16:33] <NoiseEee> (because 1 is in "18 hoover drive" and "146 Yonge Street" respectively)
[09:17:51] <Eviltwin> So rather than showing the autocomplete list, you just want to reorder the holder?
[09:17:59] <NoiseEee> Eviltwin: indeed
[09:18:11] <Eviltwin> Not sure if it's designed with that in mind
[09:18:22] <NoiseEee> Eviltwin: i agree,  it was just my first approach/idea
[09:18:31] <Eviltwin> I would take a look at events and options here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[09:18:35] <Eviltwin> See if anything looks like it migt work
[09:18:43] <Eviltwin> Possibly the open event
[09:19:06] <NoiseEee> alternatively i can just take what's in the <input> and then look through the text() of all <article>s  but i wonder if that will just be too slow
[09:19:24] <NoiseEee> i'm not sold on ui.autocomplete at all
[09:19:30] <NoiseEee> it was just my first 'similar' kind of though
[09:19:40] <Guest> This is my current problem: http://jsfiddle.net/eh6Nm/2/ anticom
[09:21:22] <NoiseEee> Eviltwin: considering http://jsfiddle.net/sGJNq/2/ is what It will really be like, do you think I should try my other option?  ie: onkeyup = search through all text() in options to find things, and if found, re-order <article>s?  seems intenseive
[09:22:04] <Eviltwin> A) Use throttling B) How long is the list?
[09:22:40] <NoiseEee> throttling = what, exactly.... and the list is about 20-50 <article>s long, with about 6 <spans> in each
[09:23:03] <NoiseEee> i was using JS before, because what renders the HTML can also render a JS object if that makes it easier
[09:23:44] <NoiseEee> ie: alternatively I can search something like  jobs = {104:{address:'18 hoover drive',priority:'high'},106:{etc}}
[09:23:55] <NoiseEee> so i have ton of flexibility, just not sure the correct approach
[09:24:41] <NoiseEee> and thinking out loud/looking for ideas
[09:26:20] <Eviltwin> NoiseEee: http://jsfiddle.net/7TBn2/1/
[09:26:22] <Eviltwin> Throttling
[09:26:35] <NoiseEee> ty
[09:26:49] <Eviltwin> Start typing
[09:27:37] <NoiseEee> i assume searching through a collection of JS objects will probably be faster than searching the .text() of each <article> so I'm leaning toward that at the moment ?
[09:27:50] <Eviltwin> NoiseEee: Absolutely
[09:28:40] <Guest> Anyone able to help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/eh6Nm/2/ ? :)
[09:28:51] <Guest> some error when trying to use the jqueryUI buttons
[09:29:13] <Eviltwin> You're not including jQuery UI
[09:29:16] <NoiseEee> Eviltwin: so maybe something along the lines of http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/ but with objects, or rendering arrays instead of objects.  anyways thanks for the ideas
[09:29:59] <Guest> js file?
[09:30:11] <Guest> checking the zip
[09:30:25] <Guest> ahhh... bloody hell.. lol thanks
[09:30:44] <Guest> I should get some sleep.. - cheers Eviltwin
[09:45:04] <Eviltwin> NoiseEee: http://jsfiddle.net/sGJNq/3/
[09:45:12] <Eviltwin> Pretty primative
[09:45:20] <Eviltwin> You can make improvements in the match callback
[09:45:34] <Eviltwin> The current method for matching is return query && text.toLowerCase().indexOf(query.toLowerCase()) >= 0;
[09:45:42] <Eviltwin> Case-insensitive exact substring
[09:49:06] <NoiseEee> wow Eviltwin thanks so much
[09:49:28] <NoiseEee> i'll also make it work with JS objects after all, a la http://jsfiddle.net/FRcvv/ but that was pretty quick searching
[09:50:11] <NoiseEee> ie, my data will most likely resemble that ^^ so i'll do the search on availObjs instead of the <article> list since it will be even faster, but I assume I'd have to iterate/search for values in the properties one at a time
[09:53:04] <min|dvir|us> http://jsfiddle.net/xS5Lb/1/ is not working right -- I want each image to fade into the next one. Inspect the <ul>'s children for debugging information.
[09:55:40] <min|dvir|us> Eviltwin: primitive, like prime, not like primate.
[09:56:05] <Eviltwin> min|dvir|us: 'Cause that was the real issue here :P
[09:57:02] <NoiseEee> also a grrrrreat way to ask for help :|
[09:57:09] <Eviltwin> Exactly
[09:57:43] <min|dvir|us> NoiseEee: ...? I have no idea what I did.
[09:57:50] <min|dvir|us> That's OK, you don't need to help if you don't want.
[10:00:53] <Che-Anarc> I'm having issues with asserting into DOM... it stops my jquery.jcarousel from working correctly... is there a correct way to be doing this - that I'm not complying with?
[10:01:38] <min|dvir|us> Che-Anarc: inserting?
[10:02:08] <Che-Anarc> Basically when I pre-create container <li>, <div>, etc...   and then populate then via script it works fine... but if I try to do the whole thing via script it doesnt work with transitions
[10:02:17] <Che-Anarc> min|dvir|us   yes inserting.
[10:02:50] <daslicht> hi
[10:03:33] <min|dvir|us> http://jsfiddle.net/xS5Lb/1/ is not working right -- I want each image to fade into the next one. Inspect the <ul>'s children for debugging information. Any thoughts?
[10:03:42] <daslicht> how does a simple delegate work ?
[10:03:44] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/TbRLr/3/
[10:03:47] <Eviltwin> Che-Anarc: You haven't given enough context
[10:03:56] <daslicht> i dont get it
[10:04:13] <Che-Anarc> Eviltwin  you mean in my descrition above of my problem?
[10:04:25] <Che-Anarc> description*
[10:04:49] <min|dvir|us> daslicht: ...? $('.playbutton').click(function() { alert('click'); });
[10:05:01] <Eviltwin> daslicht: http://jsfiddle.net/TbRLr/4/
[10:05:09] <daslicht> click only works with already existing elements
[10:05:13] <Eviltwin> daslicht: But I think you need to see ?learn
[10:05:13] <bot-t> daslicht, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[10:05:16] <Eviltwin> Big time
[10:05:22] <Eviltwin> alert.show?
[10:05:38] <Eviltwin> console.log
[10:05:42] <daslicht> ok i look on this
[10:06:10] <Eviltwin> Also see ?delegate
[10:06:10] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[10:06:25] <min|dvir|us> Back in the day we used to say "RTFM".
[10:06:26] <daslicht> i know i have read the doc either
[10:07:44] <daslicht> so u cnat add a event listener in pure js to a not existing element as it is possible with delegate ?
[10:08:01] <daslicht> onclick stuff wont help here
[10:08:08] <Eviltwin> onclick...
[10:08:11] <min|dvir|us> daslicht: jQuery is written in pure JS.
[10:08:12] <daslicht> NO
[10:08:25] <min|dvir|us> Therefore when using jQuery you are using pure JS.
[10:08:32] <daslicht> but you can : Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future,
[10:08:32] <Eviltwin> You can do the same thing delegate does but it takes a lot more code than in jQuery
[10:08:41] <daslicht> Future is the key word
[10:08:41] <Eviltwin> Which is why libraries do
[10:08:55] <Eviltwin> Make things that are a lot of code a lot less code
[10:09:00] <min|dvir|us> I believe he's trying to make the case that you should learn jQuery first?
[10:09:11] <Che-Anarc> http://pastebin.com/MhxQ2ZeX    that my code where... I'm having issues with DOM
[10:09:12] <Eviltwin> You absolutely s hould not
[10:09:13] <min|dvir|us> And actually it's quite reasonable.
[10:09:27] <Eviltwin> You need to learn advanced JavaScript first
[10:09:29] <min|dvir|us> Because without jQuery there is a lot of functionality that you just cannot make yourself.
[10:09:32] <min|dvir|us> Yeah, whatever.
[10:09:34] <daslicht> I know java
[10:09:51] <Che-Anarc> It inserts everything fine... but dynamically creating everything ceases all transitional functionality
[10:10:39] <min|dvir|us> daslicht: Do you want a B+?
[10:10:54] <daslicht> kepp on playing kidd
[10:13:02] <min|dvir|us> http://jsfiddle.net/xS5Lb/1/ -- I can see z-index is being set incorrectly on each child of .cycle.
[10:13:07] <min|dvir|us> Any thoughts?
[10:13:20] <Eviltwin> I think it's a plugin
[10:13:25] <min|dvir|us> Yeah, jQuery Cycle.
[10:13:25] <Eviltwin> Which means it's a plugin issue
[10:13:47] <min|dvir|us> I guess. Are you saying I shouldn't ask here?
[10:14:07] <__xor> hey guys :)
[10:14:12] <__xor> http://paulirish.com/2009/markup-based-unobtrusive-comprehensive-dom-ready-execution/
[10:14:18] <Eviltwin> I'm saying that if a plugin's not doing something you want it to, it's more likely than not that you'll have to edit the source to change it
[10:14:28] <Eviltwin> Part of the reason I rarely use them
[10:14:40] <__xor> I'm thinking of using that structure/pattern/whatever-you-want-to-call-it
[10:14:40] <min|dvir|us> Eviltwin: well, Cycle is very widely used and very actively developed.
[10:14:46] <MoTiOnXml> i need some suggestion here
[10:14:49] <min|dvir|us> I doubt that I can't do what I want to do in Cycle.
[10:14:50] <MoTiOnXml> :)
[10:14:59] <__xor> Anyone have any opinions on it?  Are there any popular frameworks/libraries for it yet?
[10:15:00] <MoTiOnXml> and good evening all \o
[10:15:31] <MoTiOnXml> i need to basically detect mousemove (i.e. realtime coordinates) when the pointer is over an element
[10:15:44] <Eviltwin> min|dvir|us: I suggest you read all the docs and the source
[10:15:50] <Eviltwin> Since I've never used it
[10:15:52] <MoTiOnXml> i.e. on hover, set a flag, then during mouse-move, check for flag and then do stuff
[10:15:58] <MoTiOnXml> is there a jQuery pattern for this?
[10:15:59] <__xor> What are you guys talking about?
[10:16:49] <min|dvir|us> Anyone familiar with jQuery Cycle?
[10:16:54] <MoTiOnXml> nopes
[10:16:57] <__xor> I've used it, yes.
[10:17:01] <__xor> A while back.
[10:17:12] <min|dvir|us> __xor: have you screwed with animIn/Out?
[10:17:30] <__xor> I don't know, let me see.
[10:17:44] <Eviltwin> min|dvir|us: What happens with the defaults
[10:17:56] <min|dvir|us> Eh?
[10:17:56] <__xor> Oh yeah, I remember those properties.
[10:18:03] <__xor> No, I didn't mess with them much.
[10:18:04] <min|dvir|us> http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/adv.html
[10:18:05] <MoTiOnXml> guys, i need your feedback on this scenario - i need to use the x/y coordinates when the pointer is over an element only (i.e. a droppable that i dynamically create)
[10:18:09] <MoTiOnXml> what would you suggest here?
[10:18:12] <min|dvir|us> That's a bunch of examples.
[10:18:18] <__xor> I usually use nivoSlider for the type of stuff I used Cycle for before
[10:18:19] <min|dvir|us> http://jsfiddle.net/xS5Lb/1/ is my problem.
[10:18:26] <MoTiOnXml> i mentioned the hover() function, that sets a flag, and then in mouse-move check that flag
[10:18:39] <MoTiOnXml> unless there-s a mouseover, that can filter using a selector basically
[10:18:52] <MoTiOnXml> anyone?
[10:19:23] <__xor> What? I'm trying to decipher what you're asking lol.
[10:19:34] <min|dvir|us> __xor: the problem is that each image doesn't fade into the next.
[10:19:39] <min|dvir|us> It only works sometimes.
[10:19:45] <min|dvir|us> It's a z-index issue.
[10:19:49] <Eviltwin> kmin|dvir|us: I
[10:19:51] <MoTiOnXml> right, you're busy :)
[10:19:52] <Eviltwin> Err
[10:19:54] <MoTiOnXml> i'll check back later :)
[10:19:55] <__xor> Are you sure?
[10:19:56] <Eviltwin> MoTiOnXml: Look at "var"
[10:20:03] <MoTiOnXml> Eviltwin: ?
[10:20:13] <MoTiOnXml> Eviltwin: var?!
[10:20:18] <__xor> min|dvir|us: What do you mean it doesn't fade into the next?
[10:20:24] <__xor> min|dvir|us: What is it doing instead?
[10:20:32] <__xor> MoTiOnXml: Scoping issue?
[10:20:34] <min|dvir|us> __xor: jumping directly into it.
[10:20:49] <__xor> min|dvir|us: Oh, so no animation?
[10:20:57] <Eviltwin> MoTiOnXml: Can you explain the issue further?
[10:21:01] <__xor> min|dvir|us: Just out of curiosity, but why aren't you using fadeIn() and fadeOut()?
[10:21:21] <MoTiOnXml> __xor: no, not an issue - basically when the user hovers over an element, i'd like to track x/y coordinates and show different arrows depending on which edge the pointer is
[10:21:25] <min|dvir|us> __xor: I'm using jQuery Cycle's built-in animation methods, with opacity CSS (cross-platform compatible).
[10:21:31] <MoTiOnXml> Eviltwin: as above :)
[10:21:32] <__xor> Eviltwin: Have you used that structure before? (the link I posted earlier)
[10:21:34] <min|dvir|us> __xor: It's what fadeIn and fadeOut use.
[10:22:04] <Eviltwin> I just coded a pure-JS fading slideshow that waits to transition until the images are loaded and loads them serially
[10:22:20] <__xor> min|dvir|us: I don't know enough about your particular situation to answer the question. I remember running into some issues with Cycle, which is why I switched to nivo.
[10:22:28] <__xor> min|dvir|us: I haven't used Cycle in quite a while.
[10:22:34] <MoTiOnXml> Eviltwin + __xor: basically when the user starts dragging, i'm creating a dynamic droppable - then, when the user is over that droppable i'd like to show "direction" arrows, depending on the closest edge vs. pointer
[10:22:42] <__xor> min|dvir|us: FYI, nivo shows arrows & markers.
[10:23:00] <MoTiOnXml> Eviltwin + __xor: all is nice and dandy, except for the hover-part, which i'd like to improve the implementation of
[10:23:19] <__xor> I don't know enough about it.
[10:23:33] <MoTiOnXml> __xor: talking to me? :)
[10:23:55] <__xor> Yes.
[10:25:02] <__xor> I'm going to kill my stupid ISP.
[10:25:13] <__xor> This is reminding me of @home from back in the 90s.
[10:25:28] <__xor> Paying $80/mo for a business-class connection that sucks.
[10:26:04] <__xor> Latency is jumping from 25ms to 3200ms+.  I could run to the server, say hello, and run back home faster than this.
[10:26:09] <Eviltwin> MoTiOnXml: http://jsfiddle.net/yKw4B/
[10:28:58] <Eviltwin> MoTiOnXml: I wrote that a while ago
[10:29:05] <Eviltwin> And it's not exactly what you're talking about
[10:29:32] <Eviltwin> But it uses a var as a "flag" between event listeners
[10:29:54] <__xor> How do I kick off someone that's using my nick
[10:29:55] <__xor> ?
[10:30:13] <Eviltwin> __xor: Is it reg'd?
[10:30:16] <__xor> Yes.
[10:30:22] <__xor> I own it, sheeeeeiyat.
[10:30:37] <fris> nickserv ghost

[10:36:26] <_xor> This was one of the few books I managed to save.
[10:36:35] <_xor> It still has burn marks on it and a ton of smoke damage lol.
[10:36:45] <fris> i think i have tricks of the graphics guru somewhere
[10:37:28] <_xor> werd
[10:38:58] <internetishard> Is there a difference in how http://eu.lee.com/#/campaign3 and nikefreeworld did their html5 paralax?
[10:39:55] <jedimind> nikefreeworld.com ?
[10:40:03] <jedimind> there's no paralax there from what i can see
[10:40:11] <internetishard> what would you call it?
[10:40:21] <fris> anyone use html5 local storage yet?
[10:40:24] <jedimind> you mean nike better world ?
[10:40:30] <jedimind> http://www.nikebetterworld.com/
[10:40:30] <internetishard> sorry, yeah
[10:40:56] <jedimind> internetishard, http://johnpolacek.github.com/scrollorama/  is a good library i found to handle that type of stuff
[10:41:10] <jedimind> we've used it on a few things, cant remember if that's the noe we used for better world
[10:43:12] <fris> nice work on nbw if you did it
[10:44:47] <jedimind> i was the lead front end person for it, my team did most of the work
[10:45:07] <jedimind> i worked for blast radius as their technical experience director, they're the AOR for Nike
[10:46:04] <fris> just freelance now?
[10:46:06] <MoTiOnXml> Eviltwin: checking your url
[10:47:00] <MoTiOnXml> Eviltwin: like i suggested
[10:47:17] <jedimind> fris, work for a different agency now, and do some freelance/contract work on the side
[11:14:04] <MoTiOnXml> Eviltwin: lol, mousemove has a selector that does exactly what i was looking for :)
[11:14:08] <MoTiOnXml> Eviltwin: that's too funny
[11:16:05] <jedimind> welcome to jquery
[11:16:18] <jedimind> there are so many times where ive just made up names to functions that i think should exist or events or whatever, and then they do
[11:16:33] <Eviltwin> MoTiOnXml: You mean $(window)? :P
[11:21:22] <MoTiOnXml> Eviltwin: no, i mean element.mousemove() actually just yield events when you move over the element :)
[11:21:38] <Eviltwin> Correct
[11:21:41] <Eviltwin> What'd you expect?
[11:22:09] <MoTiOnXml> i think i was under the impression that it was a global event, basically, that you'd use to check for "over your own element" :)
[11:22:59] <Eviltwin> Events don't really work that way
[11:25:10] <MoTiOnXml> Eviltwin: i know, i just completely forgot
[11:25:37] <laughahol> i'm using the filetree plugin ... i keep getting HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR after it loads the file list
[11:25:41] <MoTiOnXml> Eviltwin: thing is, i'm porting a lot of mootools code to widgets, and mootools (atleast the version i used previously), was not as mean and lean with events as jQuery is
[11:25:42] <laughahol> anyone know what i can do?
[11:29:05] <lugzer> hi
[11:35:12] <Mkop> stupid IE!
[11:35:21] <Mkop> errors without telling me why
[11:35:36] <Mkop> because [1,2,3,] is not a syntax error, it just causes messed up behavior
[11:39:07] <MoTiOnXml> is it okay to use the name "event" as an argument to a function?
[11:39:14] <lugzer> i've run into an issue when a form doesn't get submitted using this code: http://jsfiddle.net/6Xnwv/1/ -- the alerts are fired up fine, exactly when they should.. something wrong with .post().. anyone can give a hint?
[11:39:14] <MoTiOnXml> i was under the impression that event was a reserved word
[11:40:35] <Mkop> lugzer: do you have a working example (including html)?
[11:41:05] <Eviltwin> MoTiOnXml: event is not a reserved word
[11:41:20] <Eviltwin> lugzer: Might be helpful to see the form
[11:41:39] <lugzer> Eviltwin, Mkop, not really, it's kinda sensitive data.. but another thing i noticed is that when I've had the button inside the form, it was working as it should. I moved the button outside the form and it broke.. so perhaps something with this as well...
[11:42:03] <Eviltwin> Make sure there's nothing with id or name "submit"
[11:42:26] <lugzer> okay the button itself has the type="submit" - and it's a <button> tag btw
[11:42:37] <Eviltwin> The type is fine
[11:42:41] <Eviltwin> The id or name is not
[11:42:48] <Mkop> a submit button will submit the form that it's in
[11:42:53] <Mkop> if you move it outside the form.....
[11:43:07] <Mkop> then you need to explicitly submit the form
[11:43:18] <Mkop> (I think.... right?)
[11:43:36] <lugzer> Mkop, i do that with the help of jQuery
[11:43:48] <Mkop> so what is your .post(...) doing?
[11:44:19] <Mkop> oh, wait. that's not the problem
[11:44:31] <Mkop> the post is only triggered when you submit the form
[11:44:43] <Mkop> oh, wait.
[11:44:47] <Mkop> this is really hard without html
[11:44:55] <lugzer> Mkop, yes, .post is redirecting to an URL which does something and it's supposed to redirect back to '/'
[11:45:17] <lugzer> let me get some html in
[11:45:21] <Mkop> what is it actually doing?
[11:45:31] <lugzer> also, there are no errors in console, nor error logs...
[11:45:55] <Mkop> is the AJAX request firing?
[11:46:02] <Mkop> you are not doing anything once the result comes back
[11:46:10] <Mkop> no success callback
[11:46:58] <victorche> hey, someone to help me... i have a problem with setTimeout and 100% CPU :(
[11:47:15] <Eviltwin> victorche: You're making an infinite loop somewhere
[11:47:41] <victorche> Eviltwin: want to take a look? it is a short piece of code...
[11:47:54] <lugzer> Mkop, oh ok, so submit() needs to have a success callback? here's how the form is laid out http://jsfiddle.net/6Xnwv/2/
[11:48:00] <mike817> i have a form which i'm validating and then submitting through form.submit().  is there a way to preserve the original submit event details?
[11:48:05] <Mkop> no, not submit. $.post
[11:48:40] <victorche> Eviltwin?
[11:48:49] <Eviltwin> victorche: Sure
[11:48:53] <victorche> http://pastie.org/3114151
[11:49:08] <lugzer> Mkop, okay but when I had the button inside the form, it didn't require a success callback. it was redirecting to that url from .post() and then that function (PHP) was generating an XML file and doing a PHP redirect back to /
[11:49:14] <Eviltwin> Don't use strings for that
[11:49:21] <victorche> 2 small functions, to get the count of registered users and online users
[11:49:30] <Eviltwin> mike817: Take a look at: http://jsfiddle.net/h54dd/
[11:49:54] <Mkop> lugzer: my suspicion is that before you were submitting the form directly rather than via jquery
[11:50:19] <lugzer> Mkop, yeah I think you're right on that..
[11:50:28] <Eviltwin> victorche: Either use setInterval or pass the interval in
[11:50:36] <Eviltwin> victorche: This is a deprecated way of using setTimeout
[11:50:41] <mike817> Eviltwin: thanks, but i know how to do it with ajax. i'm looking to capture the original submit in this case since the form.submit() replaces it.
[11:51:16] <victorche> Eviltwin: can you give me a hint? Really don't know how to do it with setInterval
[11:51:49] <Eviltwin> victorche: http://pastie.org/3114173
[11:53:05] <quizme> hey
[11:53:25] <victorche> Eviltwin: so, still with setTimeout? but this way?
[11:53:51] <Eviltwin> It depends on what you're trying to do exactly
[11:54:01] <quizme> why you do FileReader.readAsBinaryString( profile_pic ) <-- is the loaded result the exact same thing as what is in the "profile_pic.png" file?
[11:54:18] <victorche> to get the count of the online and registered users... on the main page
[11:54:19] <quizme> "why" = "when"
[11:54:28] <victorche> without refreshing the page
[11:54:56] <Eviltwin> victorche: You might want this: http://pastie.org/3114195
[11:55:09] <victorche> Eviltwin: when looking at the index page, to see the online number of users
[11:55:18] <Eviltwin> quizme: I'd read the docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/FileReader
[11:56:07] <victorche> Eviltwin: thanks, really! But what of those two is better? Really have no idea :)
[11:56:36] <Eviltwin> victorche: The first one starts the AJAX every 8 seconds
[11:56:49] <Eviltwin> The second one waits 8 seconds between when the AJAX ends and the next begins
[11:57:08] <victorche> Eviltwin: thanks! will try now...
[11:57:53] <surfdue> i have a function defined with an each inside, how do i update that each for example with a 'live' to list each new object after an ajax request?
[11:58:07] <surfdue> for example ajax updated the #content div. I need to get the new li's inside the content div.
[11:58:51] <Eviltwin> What...?
[11:59:03] <surfdue> hey Eviltwin im not explaining this well let me try again :P
[12:00:40] <surfdue> Page loads, jquery loads content in through .load(), into a div #content this div contains li elements with a elements inside. Each a element has several spans with different classes. I need to find the one a (if it exists) with the span.name .html() == 'test'
[12:01:09] <surfdue> is there a way to find which a span.name's html == test without an each ?
[12:01:10] <Eviltwin> Does this have anything to do with events?
[12:01:23] <surfdue> Eviltwin: no its a function I am using to load "saved files"
[12:02:27] <surfdue> i guess I can use contains?
[12:02:43] <Eviltwin> At some point, an .each or effective equivalent will happen
[12:03:18] <Eviltwin> I believe :contains works on substrings of the text, not the HTML
[12:03:57] <surfdue> ah
[12:09:09] <surfdue> Eviltwin: contains appears to work for like <div>test</div>
[12:09:20] <surfdue> so it should work for <span class="name">test</span>
[12:09:24] <surfdue> atleast I assume so
[12:09:47] <Eviltwin> If you have <div id="foo">Hello, <i>World!</i></div>
[12:10:06] <Eviltwin> And try $("#foo:contains(<i>World!</i>)")
[12:10:16] <Eviltwin> It won't work
[12:10:29] <Eviltwin> But $("#foo:contains(World!)") should
[12:14:09] <eugenmayer> iam using the $('td:nth-child(<int>)').hide syntax to hide away columns. Now i also have row-header and the index seems to be wrong. Anyone has an advice?
[12:16:45] <riyonuk> When I animate a div to just have its width change on hover, the text inside, I cant select. How can I make it selectable?
[12:22:47] <mike817> is there a way to catch the submit button event data?
[12:23:14] <Mkop> ?.submit @ mike817
[12:23:16] <bot-t> mike817, .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[12:23:37] <Mkop> look at the parameters for that function
[12:24:33] <mike817> i have. apparently you can't console.log(eventData)?
[12:24:47] <Eviltwin> What?
[12:25:59] <eugenmayer> is there a way to do something like
[12:26:07] <eugenmayer> "the nth td or tr child?
[12:26:22] <eugenmayer> $('tbody td:nth-child(' + i + ')).hide()
[12:26:34] <eugenmayer> this leads to issues when you have row-header ( so tr )..
[12:26:58] <Eviltwin> That is the tds that are the nth child
[12:27:18] <Eviltwin> Not the nth td within the parent
[12:29:02] <mike817> is there a proper way to view the submit eventData?
[12:29:26] <Eviltwin> I don't understand the question
[12:29:34] <eugenmayer> Eviltwin: not sure i undestood you. I have col-headers. I  do some filtering on those thead th…and get the cellIndex of some of those thead th. Now i would like to hide all "cols" in th tbody..
[12:29:36] <Eviltwin> But I suggest you see ?.trigger and see ?.bind
[12:29:37] <bot-t> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[12:29:37] <bot-t> .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[12:29:55] <mike817> i want to see the contents of the submit() eventData
[12:30:10] <mike817> or is that only for passing data in?
[12:30:25] <eugenmayer> Eviltwin: basically this: http://jsfiddle.net/mLGT9/
[12:31:59] <eugenmayer> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/mLGT9/1/
[12:32:08] <eugenmayer> updated the example to be useable in this scope
[12:32:21] <eugenmayer> the current example should hide all non-header cols
[12:33:47] <Eviltwin> eugenmayer: http://jsfiddle.net/mLGT9/2/
[12:33:51] <Eviltwin> Take a look at that
[12:34:00] <Eviltwin> I think it might be what you're looking for
[12:34:09] <eugenmayer> Eviltwin: ill do, just an update : http://jsfiddle.net/mLGT9/3/ ( corrected and tidy )
[12:34:29] <nicholasschulz> stupid question, but I want to know…. What is DOM?
[12:34:38] <Eviltwin> nicholasschulz: It's the Document Object Model
[12:34:48] <Eviltwin> JavaScript operates on the DOM, not on HTML
[12:34:57] <nicholasschulz> Ah, ok :-) Thanks
[12:35:00] <Eviltwin> The DOM is a tree with things like .parentNode, .firstChild, .nextSibling etc.
[12:36:17] <mike817> after a form has been submitted, is it possible to tell which element triggered the submit event?
[12:36:47] <Eviltwin> Peek at http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[12:37:09] <jedimind> mike817, how are you submitting the form ?
[12:37:18] <jedimind> standard post/get or xhr ?
[12:37:40] <mike817> standard post
[12:38:08] <jedimind> the name/value of your <button> should get submitted as part of the post
[12:38:20] <jedimind> http://www.javascript-coder.com/html-form/html-form-submit.phtml
[12:39:01] <mike817> but i have two submit buttons and i want to find out which button submitted the form
[12:39:08] <Eviltwin> Bind to the buttons
[12:39:22] <jedimind> mike817, read the url i gave you?
[12:39:35] <jedimind> it gives you a very clear example of how to distinguish between the buttons
[12:40:00] <mike817> i'm not trying to catch it on the server side.
[12:40:17] <jedimind> oh then just bind an event to the buttons
[12:40:43] <jedimind> $('#button1').click(function() { do something }); $('#button2').click(function() { do something else })
[12:40:52] <mike817> basically i'm trying to figure out if there's a way to view the details of the submit event
[12:41:05] <jedimind> that's a basic exmple, if you want anthing more involved, do it on $('form').submit() and sniff out which button triggered the event
[12:41:26] <Eviltwin> mike817: "view"?
[12:42:23] <mike817> view, dump, etc. i want to see what usable data the submit event has so i can see if there was something to identify the trigger by
[12:43:34] <reative> hi, is it possible that jquer-ui selectbale works like checkboxes?
[12:43:41] <reative> selectable
[12:44:26] <Eviltwin> mike817: http://jsfiddle.net/qeseS/
[12:46:17] <jedimind> wtf does it make sense that jsfiddles layout is fucked in firefox?
[12:46:50] <jazzybee> $.getScript sets caching to false. If I set caching to true, will that have any effect on cross-domain scripts or only same-domain?
[12:47:10] <Eviltwin> Only same, I believe
[12:47:13] <Eviltwin> Unless it's adding a nonce
[12:47:15] <Eviltwin> Perhaps
[12:47:44] <jazzybee> Eviltwin: Any way to force caching on cross domain scripts? I use static.mydomain.com for CSS and JS
[12:47:53] <jedimind> www.pud.ca/misc/jsfiddle.png
[12:47:54] <jedimind> :(
[12:48:04] <Eviltwin> jazzybee: A nonce
[12:48:22] <Eviltwin> jedimind: Make sure your scripts aren't stopped in Firebug or something
[12:48:26] <jedimind> they're not
[12:48:39] <eugenmayer> Eviltwin: i simplified it a bit, but can get what i want. I .e.g want to hide all cols indexed "0"..http://jsfiddle.net/mLGT9/9/
[12:48:50] <jedimind> it was just a freak load i guess
[12:49:12] <mike817> Eviltwin: so is there a way to get the ID of the submit button that was clicked?
[12:49:55] <lugzer> Mkop, okay I think I kinda know what's going on with my form. it gets redirected to the URL which is supposed to perform some PHP work, and then get back. now it just gets there (form action is set to this URL) and doesn't go back. does this mean ajax form shouldn't have this action URL set?
[12:50:06] <jedimind> mike817, did you see your console after you submitted that example?
[12:50:06] <Eviltwin> eugenmayer: I don't understand what's going on here. Look at what I sent you and build on it
[12:50:16] <Eviltwin> mike817: Look at the second thing with the click and do that
[12:50:20] <jazzybee> Eviltwin: The documentaion for $.ajax() says it adds a nonce unless cache option is set to true. But it has no mention of same domain vs. cross domain
[12:50:47] <Eviltwin> ?tias @ jazzybee
[12:50:47] <bot-t> jazzybee, Try It And See
[12:50:57] <Eviltwin> Use Firebug or something
[12:51:15] <jazzybee> Eviltwin: So Firebug does not report scripts that are imported via getScript
[12:51:20] <jedimind> submitting / pulling via ajax cross domain requires you to have control over both environments
[12:51:24] <jedimind> so that you an establish cross-domain policies
[12:51:38] <Eviltwin> jazzybee: Firebug should report everything network
[12:51:47] <Eviltwin> If not, use Chrome or Safari
[12:51:54] <reative> http://jsfiddle.net/WsTtm/ how is it possible to select and deselect, like checkboxes?
[12:52:07] <Eviltwin> reative: What?
[12:52:24] <domcat1> what is the best api to get movie covers?
[12:52:48] <reative> i want to select multiple elements, and deselct them if i want
[12:53:22] <ravenzz> jedimind it work perfectly here
[12:53:34] <jedimind> your face
[12:53:38] <jedimind> i have no idea what you're referring to
[12:53:52] <ravenzz> jsfiddle on ff
[12:54:36] <reative> http://jsfiddle.net/WsTtm/ i can only select 1 item in this demo, i want to check item 2 and 4 and 5
[12:55:00] <jedimind> ravenzz, it loaded fine after a few hard refreshes, i mentioned it was a freak load probably
[12:55:20] <Eviltwin> reative: http://jqueryui.com/demos/selectable/
[12:55:20] <ravenzz> uh k I miss that
[12:55:29] <Eviltwin> Read the italic text just below the demo
[12:55:45] <jedimind> italic text is so hard to pay attention to
[12:56:02] <Eviltwin> This works like a list in a directory
[12:56:24] <jedimind> except you cant start the selection in the whitespace around the items
[12:56:25] <jedimind> :(
[12:56:47] <jedimind> but that's just as a result of that ul not being big enough
[12:56:49] <reative> Hold down the Ctrl key to make multiple non-adjacent selections. <- is not working
[12:57:01] <Eviltwin> It is working
[12:57:25] <reative> oh ok, but not in my demo
[12:58:06] <reative> is it possible to do this without the CTRL-key
[12:58:09] <reative> ?
[12:58:15] <Eviltwin> reative: It is working in the demo
[12:58:19] <Eviltwin> What operating system are you using?
[12:58:43] <reative> windows 7
[12:58:59] <Eviltwin> What's wrong with Ctrl then?
[12:59:27] <reative> the user don´t know what the Ctrl-key is
[12:59:49] <reative> they are old and hav no plan from pcs
[13:00:13] <Eviltwin> What?
[13:00:33] <Eviltwin> Ignorance isn't the solution
[13:00:47] <Eviltwin> If you want to make them "like checkboxes" use this: http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#checkbox
[13:02:28] <reative> ok thanks
[13:03:34] <jazzybee> Eviltwin: So this is interesting. It doesn't add a nonce at all. I haven't even set the caching parameter to true. So that's great.
[13:03:55] <jazzybee> I checked using Fiddler on Firefox and Chrome
[14:03:43] <_ramo> hi
[14:03:44] <aple> Anyone use Raphael JS?
[14:04:10] <jedimind> who's raphael and why does he get his own js ?
[14:04:24] <aple> NICE! *high five*
[14:04:34] <_ramo> how can i add a styling class to my <a> tag? is it like this: var a = $('<a>', {	        href: "http://myurls.com/" + item.value,	        text: item.label,	        class: "my-style-class"	    }); ?
[14:04:52] <Eviltwin> Um, sure
[14:05:23] <_ramo> Eviltwin: and how do i do that for labels?
[14:05:59] <usch> Hello. Is there a callback function for .attr? I would like to execute some code after an image was loaded which I set with $('img#myId').attr('src', 'http://foo/bar.jpg');
[14:06:12] <Eviltwin> usch: Use the .load event
[14:06:27] <Eviltwin> _ramo: How do you think?
[14:06:40] <_ramo> Eviltwin: i thought the label must refere to an element
[14:06:47] <_ramo> so the reference to the id of an element
[14:07:27] <aple> _ramo: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[14:09:43] <usch> Eviltwin, it works, thx!
[14:10:09] <Eviltwin> usch: .attr doesn't have a callback because the attribute is set immediately
[14:10:20] <Eviltwin> The effect of setting the attribute causes the image to load
[14:10:32] <usch> yeah, that's what I thought.
[14:10:43] <usch> Sometimes it's that easy :)
[14:20:23] <red__> I just want to know if jquery has its own json parser or if it uses eval
[14:20:32] <Eviltwin> It uses JSON.parse, I believe
[14:20:41] <Eviltwin> I don't believe there's an eval() anywhere inside jQuery
[14:20:45] <Eviltwin> As it is considered a bad practice
[14:35:50] <Forbidd3n> When I do console.log( $(this) ); on a file input field after change, it gives me the object of the input field and under context it has a value and it gives the entire full path of the file. How can I access that from within jquery?
[14:39:37] <jim334> !help
[14:40:39] <lugzer> when a checkbox is checked with jquery - $(this).prop('checked', true) - it seems that its state won't be recognized by .live('change').. is that correct statement?
[14:42:43] <jim334> Hi everyone. I'm having trouble with setting the value of an input field in an external window. The child window is opening multiple iframes...  http://jsfiddle.net/CZtNN/1/
[14:43:12] <Eviltwin> ?sop @ jim334
[14:43:13] <bot-t> jim334, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[14:44:33] <jim334> no chance of a workaround I suppose?
[14:45:22] <Eviltwin> A workaround for SOP?
[14:45:22] <Eviltwin> No
[14:45:29] <Eviltwin> It would be a massive security risk
[14:45:58] <jim334> Thanks for clearing that up :)

[14:49:54] <krambiorix> hi guys, i'm learning jquery, can someone says what this means: $("#calendarInside", '#Calendar').fullCalendar("refetchEvents");
[14:50:21] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ krambiorix
[14:50:21] <bot-t> krambiorix, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[14:52:41] <MoTiOnXml> Eviltwin: :)
[14:52:45] <MoTiOnXml> wee
[14:53:00] <MoTiOnXml> well, better gtfo out and catch some $l33p
[14:53:04] <MoTiOnXml> \o tomorrow
[14:55:04] <krambiorix> ok i will but what does it mean?
[14:55:30] <Eviltwin> .fullCalendar is a plugin
[14:56:01] <Eviltwin> $("#calendarInside",'#Calendar') means the element with ID calendarInside inside the element with ID Calendar
[14:56:06] <qom2> looking for something that gives the same effect that this page has: http://emilolsson.com/shop/demo/layers/ (if you resize the window the images/slideshow will adjust) ideas?
[14:56:58] <Eviltwin> It makes the collection of that element and then triggers the fullCalendar plugin method refetchEvents method on that calendar
[14:57:12] <Eviltwin> Kind of a lot going on
[14:57:30] <Eviltwin> Which is why I suggested you learn JavaScript and jQuery from the bottom up first
[14:58:26] <krambiorix> Eviltwin, ok thx!
[14:58:39] <Eviltwin> qom2: As much as people want it to be so, there aren't plugins for every specific feature you're looking for
[14:58:51] <krambiorix> Eviltwin, any suggestions where/how to start?
[14:58:54] <Eviltwin> qom2: This is one you're probably going to have to custom code for your situation
[14:58:59] <qom2> of course, I'm just wondering if anyone has come across something like it
[14:59:31] <Eviltwin> qom2: Probably combining $(window).resize(...) with $(window).height()
[14:59:47] <Eviltwin> Then selecting the necessary things that need to be resized
[15:00:05] <Eviltwin> And using the .height(...) (and possibly .width(...)) setter on them
[15:00:13] <qom2> resizing images ain't that hard, I'm just curious if it will be harder being that the images are in a carousel..
[15:00:18] <Eviltwin> krambiorix: Already linked it to you at least once

[15:00:55] <Eviltwin> qom2: You'll need to make them smaller than the window height so as to accommodate the carousel frame perhaps
[15:10:21] <wish^> Hi. Im using jquery to make a slideshow header but i cant seem to get it to work, it just shows me box with scrolls and all the pictures after each other as i scroll
[15:10:25] <wish^> any help is appreciated
[15:16:03] <wish^> anyone?
[15:16:46] <Eviltwin> Your question was incredibly vague
[15:16:53] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ wish^
[15:16:53] <bot-t> wish^, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[15:19:26] <LordThumper> Is there any way to create/fire custom events in Javascript/jQuery?
[15:19:47] <Eviltwin> Depends on what you want them to do and who you want to have pick them up
[15:20:36] <Eviltwin> You can't artificially create a browser event that will hit things bound with addEventListerner / attachEvent
[15:21:05] <LordThumper> I wanted to fire an event from some function. Then pick it up with jQuery
[15:21:08] <Eviltwin> But you can create an artificial jQuery Event that things bound with .on/.bind/.live/.delegate will pick up
[15:21:15] <Eviltwin> So fire it
[15:21:21] <Eviltwin> LordThumper: see ?.trigger
[15:21:21] <bot-t> LordThumper, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[15:21:32] <LordThumper> Awesome thanks Eviltwin
[15:22:08] <wish^> Eviltwin, can i pm you the url and you will see what i mean?
[15:22:19] <wish^> im 100% its a simple problem ive just never used jquery before
[15:22:25] <Eviltwin> wish^: I have to go shortly
[15:22:31] <Eviltwin> Are you using a plugin for this or are you coding it yourself?
[15:22:43] <wish^> i used an example online
[15:22:49] <wish^> and modified it
[15:24:43] <wish^> i have posted the code also on a pastebin
[15:24:50] <Eviltwin> Then please share publicy
[15:24:54] <Eviltwin> publicly*
[15:24:58] <Eviltwin> I may have to leave shortly
[15:25:44] <Eviltwin> Also have you ever used Firebug or the Chrome/Safari Developer Tools
[15:34:31] <wish^> My header on http://testing.w1sh.net is supposed to be a slideshow but its showing as if its not registering the jquery script.. :( any ideas?
[15:35:21] <Eviltwin> Looks like you're pretty new to JavaScript/jQuery
[15:35:39] <Eviltwin> So first question
[15:35:48] <Eviltwin> Is there a reason you have both jQuery and MooTools?
[15:36:01] <Eviltwin> Second, have you ever used a JavaScript Debugger
[15:36:12] <Eviltwin> Like Firebug or the Safari/Chrome Developer Tools
[15:37:19] <lugzer> hey, i'm trying to understand why .live() doesn't pick up a state change on the checkbox here: http://jsfiddle.net/Bh7ba/8/ -- any hints please?
[15:38:21] <wish^> yea im new to jquery idd
[15:38:34] <deed02392> hey guys, I think I have a race condition going on here, could someone advise on how I might get around it? at the moment I use this line of code within a span to update the contents of a span: http://pastebin.com/0C8GEasQ
[15:38:45] <deed02392> however occasionally i get the error that ajax is not defined
[15:38:54] <wish^> i dont understand why it is not working though
[15:39:05] <deed02392> how can i adapt this to perhaps wait for it to be defined before running?
[15:39:10] <wish^> http://jsfiddle.net/z4E3C/
[15:40:00] <Eviltwin> lugzer: The browser generates the change event on blur in most cases
[15:40:11] <Eviltwin> When the user leaves the input
[15:40:22] <Eviltwin> For example, a change doesn't fire on a text box until you click away from it
[15:40:24] <Eviltwin> Or tab away from it
[15:40:32] <wish^> is motools interferring with jquery?
[15:40:42] <Eviltwin> lugzer: You can do this: http://jsfiddle.net/Bh7ba/9/
[15:40:55] <systemfault> If both use the $ sign then of course they interfer with each other...
[15:41:06] <systemfault> Check for .noConflict()
[15:41:26] <Eviltwin> wish^: HAVE YOU EVER USED A JAVASCRIPT DEBUGGER?
[15:41:49] <Eviltwin> deed02392: What is "ajax"?
[15:41:59] <wish^> no eviltwin
[15:42:05] <lugzer> Eviltwin, yeah i was looking to trigger a change() on a checkbox somehow.. thanks for the tip!
[15:43:06] <Eviltwin> wish^: http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[15:43:09] <deed02392> oh sorry Eviltwin, it's an ajax object based off a class which came with the cms i'm using
[15:43:11] <Eviltwin> wish^: Follow that
[15:43:26] <deed02392> i also use jquery though
[15:43:35] <Eviltwin> deed02392: Where does that ajax object get defined?
[15:43:37] <Eviltwin> Some included file?
[15:43:41] <deed02392> yeah
[15:44:02] <Eviltwin> Is that included file included before the ones that use it?
[15:44:06] <Eviltwin> wish^: Also see ?learn
[15:44:06] <bot-t> wish^, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[15:44:15] <deed02392> yeah it is Eviltwin
[15:44:27] <deed02392> the line i pasted is inline with the site html
[15:44:33] <deed02392> within an element
[15:44:38] <deed02392> and the included file is in the doc head
[15:44:46] <Eviltwin> But below the <script> that includes/defines the ajax module?
[15:45:01] <deed02392> yeah
[15:45:08] <Eviltwin> Then I have no idea
[15:45:11] <Eviltwin> Maybe a bad module?
[15:45:16] <Eviltwin> Poorly designed
[15:45:22] <deed02392> well it only happens temporamentally
[15:45:29] <deed02392> that's why i think it's a race condition
[15:45:33] <deed02392> sometimes it doesn't happen, sometimes it does
[15:45:35] <deed02392> even on the same page
[15:46:50] <deed02392> but i could replace it to use jquery
[15:47:20] <deed02392> but on firefox at least it seems that script within elements can be executed before included javascript files are downloaded
[15:47:28] <deed02392> that's the main issue
[15:47:35] <wish^> eviltwin, says Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLDocument> has no method 'ready'
[15:47:41] <deed02392> is there some way to make it wait for it to be defined first
[15:47:49] <deed02392> rather than trying and failing if it's not yet defined?
[15:48:07] <systemfault> wish^: wrap it..
[15:48:26] <Eviltwin> wish^: See slide 8
[15:49:49] <JCDenton> Say I want to submit a form using jquery/ajax. This form is submitting using POST to a PHP script, which returns a "0" on failure, and "1" on success. How can I get the form to give an alert based on if a success or failed response was received, without having to reload the page?
[15:50:12] <GeO> hey guys
[15:50:14] <JCDenton> Or should I ask this in #javascript ?
[15:50:30] <Eviltwin> JCDenton: see ?.ajax
[15:50:30] <bot-t> JCDenton, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[15:50:36] <GeO> what's the best way nowadays to use sounds in a webpage with js ?
[15:50:41] <Eviltwin> JCDenton: see ?.serialize
[15:50:41] <bot-t> JCDenton, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[15:50:55] <JCDenton> Eviltwin, thanks
[15:51:01] <Eviltwin> GeO: There's still no great way if you want to start/stop/skip/replay etc.
[15:51:14] <wish^> hmm im confused
[15:51:48] <GeO> I don't need those options, it's just to say messages times to times, not a continueous stream
[15:51:57] <Eviltwin> wish^: Move the jquery include above the headerslide include
[15:52:07] <Eviltwin> If it's below, that means it's not defined when the headerslide is run
[15:52:10] <Eviltwin> This is JavaScript 101
[15:52:19] <Eviltwin> Which is why I think you need to see ?learn
[15:52:19] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[15:52:22] <Eviltwin> And start there
[15:52:27] <Eviltwin> And actually understand this stuff
[15:52:42] <Eviltwin> Instead of just shooting in the dark and hoping you hit your target
[15:52:49] <JCDenton> I really need to actually sit and learn Javascript.
[15:52:50] <deed02392> Eviltwin should I ask my question again in javascript?
[15:53:03] <Eviltwin> deed02392: If it's not jQuery-specific, then sure
[15:53:09] <Eviltwin> And I don't believe it is
[15:53:22] <deed02392> indeed
[15:54:37] <GeO> Eviltwin what's the lightweight alternative then?
[15:54:55] <Eviltwin> GeO: I don't think I implied there was one
[15:54:56] <GeO> I found http://www.jplayer.org/, jquery based, don't know if it's worth it
[15:54:58] <JCDenton> "Due to browser security restrictions, most "Ajax" requests are subject to the same origin policy; the request can not successfully retrieve data from a different domain, subdomain, or protocol."
[15:55:07] <Eviltwin> GeO: That's kind of heavy
[15:55:15] <JCDenton> Right then, I didn't know that. Can't use this then, bah
[15:55:15] <GeO> you said if you want to...I don't want it :p
[15:55:31] <Eviltwin> GeO: This is a question for #javascript
[15:55:46] <GeO> ok I'll try there, thank you
[15:55:52] <Eviltwin> JCDenton: You want to submit to someone else's server?
[15:56:11] <JCDenton> Eviltwin, Aye
[15:56:20] <Eviltwin> That's a security risk
[15:56:29] <JCDenton> Aye. I can see that.
[15:56:31] <Eviltwin> For all we know, you could be trying to crack a password
[15:56:47] <JCDenton> I didn't even think of that when I was asking
[15:58:07] <wish^> thanks alot Eviltwin, i should know this. since its kind of the same thing as with css style sheets
[15:58:18] <Eviltwin> Um...sure
[15:58:27] <wish^> honest mistake
[15:58:47] <Eviltwin> wish^: Which is why you should learn JavaScript instead of just shooting blindlg
[15:58:49] <Eviltwin> blindly*
[15:58:55] <wish^> yup
[15:59:39] * JCDenton has a really bad habit of shooting blindly.
[16:22:15] <aple> Is there any jQuery plugin that does camera panning effects?
[16:23:05] <aple> Not 3d, but... more like Flash... where the viewport is the scene and you can make stuff slide through?
[16:24:09] <Eviltwin> Do you have an example of what you're talking about?
[16:33:11] <aple> nevermind, found something awesome.
[16:35:04] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky ........
[16:35:05] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[16:35:22] <JCDenton> That creepy guy who uses a winking face after everything he says.  ;)
[16:35:33] <JCDenton> Oh
[16:35:35] <JCDenton> Wrong channel
[16:40:18] <z1000> if you hover main nav links 2-4 notice dropdown... I want the main button to stay highlighted normally would just use li:hover but that kills the fade effects.. was looking into parents() and parentsUntil() .. curious what is the best option you guys may recommend : http://ogkey.com/new/
[16:44:14] <ravenzz> z1000 css3?
[16:44:26] <z1000> eh?
[16:45:35] <ravenzz> you could use css3 to do that
[16:45:43] <ravenzz> (the fade effect)
[16:45:49] <z1000> is that the best approach?
[16:46:02] <z1000> too many people still on ie7/8?
[16:46:16] <ravenzz> uhm when I can do something avoiding js I am happy
[16:46:29] <z1000> unless it doesnt work for all users
[16:46:52] <ravenzz> for the ones that doesn't support those css3 features you can provide a js polyfill
[16:49:04] <ravenzz> z1000 here is an example http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6098856/using-modernizr-and-jquery-to-animate-if-css3-transitions-dont-exist#answer-6114103
[16:49:37] <z1000> hmm
[16:49:47] <z1000> could be good but not really what I need
[16:49:59] <z1000> I was thinking on subnav ul hover.. add a tempActive class to parent li
[16:50:08] <z1000> which hass css properties of !important
[16:50:30] <z1000> just not sure how to go up the ancestor chain to proper element
[16:51:41] <z1000> http://collabedit.com/2qxad
[16:51:55] <z1000> but that was only going to the ul not parent li .. any ideas?
[16:51:56] <aghouseh> im trying to set a global within a $.ajax success function to be accessed later on, but the variable is empty. what am i missing?
[16:54:21] <aghouseh> http://pastie.org/3115554
[16:54:31] <aghouseh> throws an error because $ban is undefined in that scope
[16:54:51] <LordThumper> Any way to change Sortable placeholder size according to the div height?
[16:57:07] <daleharvey> anyone think of an easy way to be able to opaquely read and write things like background attributes? - http://pastebin.me/d616f84b269b0e1deb8321437000602f
[16:58:22] <dark> what is the cleanest way to check if an object has a member x at all? a[x] != null maybe? (doesn't *need* to use jquery.. unless it has some function to aid with that)
[16:58:44] <dark> i'm afraid of hitting corner cases (of undefined vs. null or something like that)
[16:59:13] <daleharvey> typeof a.x === 'undefined'
[17:00:09] <dark> so actually if (typeof a[x] !== 'undefined') { a has member x; } ?
[17:10:04] <ravenzz> z1000 this is what I mean http://jsfiddle.net/F5jp5/
[17:10:59] <ravenzz> z1000 sorry this http://jsfiddle.net/F5jp5/1/
[17:11:11] <z1000> hmm
[17:11:12] <LordThumper> Is there any way to get which element is being sorted? I
[17:11:36] <LordThumper> During the "start" event handler if possible
[17:12:49] <z1000> seems cool but I could just use li:hover
[17:13:20] <z1000> ahh nm I see
[17:13:34] <z1000> in chrome its showing the fade.. thats cool but not widely supported enough? or use modernizer type thing?
[17:14:05] <LordThumper> $(event.target) and $(this) are not giving me the element being "dragged"
[17:14:25] <ravenzz> it is supported on chrome, ff, opera and ie 10+
[17:14:53] <ravenzz> so you could go for the css3 effect + modernzr solution
[17:15:14] <ravenzz> if you want the effect for IE<10
[17:15:56] <ale_> Hello, let's say I have a = new [ $('#abc').attr('id') ], how can I show content of a??
[18:07:52] <LordThumper> I am using jQuery UI Sortable. It is working correctly, however when I switch stylesheet, the item being dragged goes up by around 100px. The functionality is otherwise unaffected
[18:15:04] <LordThumper> Removing container had no effect..
[18:19:59] <LordThumper> Ok overflow-x: hidden was causing the problem
[18:28:28] <nutron> anyone know if there's a pre-made tool that would allow me to show say, a calendar week, with the center date zoomed in, and the other 3 on each side a normal size.. then as you click the arrows... the date in the center changes?  I've figured out how to create the slider .. just can't figure out how the magnified center would work..
[18:41:33] <eugenmayer> how could i do a logic and here: $('td:not([foo=bar]&&[foo==foobst)') =
[18:45:41] <eugenmayer> is there something like  >=1
[18:45:48] <eugenmayer> so great / lower then ?
[18:45:53] <eugenmayer> cant find it in the ref
[19:34:54] <vanillacake> hey quick question, I'm scanning through some jQuery code and it looks like this - http://www.screencast.com/t/8olesY6u1T  ... any idea how to make it into standard structured format?
[19:36:33] <vanillacake> hey quick question, I'm scanning through some jQuery code and it looks like this - http://www.screencast.com/t/8olesY6u1T  ... any idea how to make it into standard structured format?

[19:38:04] <smplstk> alternatively, just paste it into the JavaScript window on http://jsfiddle.net/ and hit 'TidyUp'
[19:38:20] <surfdue> best way to copy to clipboard?
[19:39:03] <smplstk> vanillacake: in aptana, if you select your code and right click, is there not a 'format' option, or something similar?

[19:44:13] <vanillacake> yeah it worked, now I just want to get my aptana to be able to format it
[19:44:23] <vanillacake> just looking up how to get to the error log now
[19:44:41] <vanillacake> and thanks for the help smplstk
[19:44:50] <smplstk> np, I'm sure aptana can do it.
[19:44:59] <smplstk> I'm not familiar enough with it.
[19:45:22] <vanillacake> yeah I agree, I tried the format before i asked in here but didn't see the error message so just need to sort a few things out and I should be good to go ;)
[19:45:27] <concernedcitizen> Decoy_: oh, I'm trying to show all the child and sub child elements that are below the parent element
[19:46:15] <smplstk> concernedcitizen: so they're already 'hidden', then?
[19:46:21] <concernedcitizen> yeah
[19:46:32] <Decoy_> They are hidden and you want to show them? E.g. $( all your stuff ).show(); ?
[19:46:33] <smplstk> concernedcitizen: http://api.jquery.com/hidden-selector/
[19:48:01] <smplstk> concernedcitizen: and then .show() as Decoy_ had mentioned, but it makes more sense to show/hide a parent element, rather than showing/hiding _ALL_ hidden .children()
[19:48:19] <concernedcitizen> ah!
[19:48:26] <concernedcitizen> I did do a show for the parent element
[19:48:34] <concernedcitizen> but apparently, the child elements do not show at all
[19:49:15] <Decoy_> how are they hidden?
[19:49:18] <smplstk> if they're set to 'display: none;' then showing _JUST_ the parent will not be enough to unhide them.
[19:49:51] <smplstk> a code/markup example would be very helpful
[19:52:27] <vanillacake> Has anyone ever installed the jQuery bundle in Aptana Studio 3?
[19:52:51] <smplstk> concernedcitizen: here's a little example, http://jsfiddle.net/DpTuc/
[19:53:36] <concernedcitizen> here's my paste http://pastie.org/3116203
[19:53:46] <vanillacake> this is what I'm dealing with right now.. http://bin.cakephp.org/view/2136482825
[19:54:44] <vanillacake> I'm assuming to fix it I have to install the Aptana Studio 3 jQuery bundle
[19:55:33] <smplstk> vanillacake: JSFormatter
[19:55:34] <surfdue> no body knows the best jquery copy 2 clipboard
[19:55:50] <smplstk> surfdue: you can't really do it with JUST JS
[19:56:18] <smplstk> surfdue: there's no way that's 100% effective cross browser
[19:56:26] <smplstk> surfdue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/400212/how-to-copy-to-clipboard-in-javascript
[19:56:46] <vanillacake> k I'll just use to the jsfiddle, I was hopping to get my aptana format working
[19:56:54] <smplstk> ?lmgtfy copy to clipboard in javascript @ surfdue
[19:56:54] <bot-t> surfdue, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=copy+to+clipboard+in+javascript
[19:57:35] <surfdue> that sucks
[19:57:44] <surfdue> smplstk: i seen all those..
[19:57:44] <concernedcitizen> smplstk: i think that hidden selector works
[19:57:45] <concernedcitizen> thanks.
[19:57:52] <surfdue> im in disbelief that you have to use flash..
[19:58:19] <smplstk> it is what it is.
[19:59:06] <surfdue> first thing i ever seen jquery not able to handle
[19:59:17] <surfdue> or javascript that is
[20:00:20] <smplstk> surfdue: it kind of makes sense when you think about it, if JS had access to clipboard you could technically 'nab' somebodies critical data
[20:00:38] <surfdue> smplstk: I can nab files from their computer :)
[20:00:40] <danzik171> has nothing to do with javascript not being able to do it, it's a security issue.  both IE and FF have config settings that enable clipboard access via JS, Chrome doesn't.
[20:00:50] <surfdue> smplstk: and upload them with jquery/ajax and they wouldnt even know
[20:00:54] <smplstk> bit.ly uses ZeroClipboart, FYI
[20:00:56] <surfdue> if I knew the exact location.
[20:01:08] <smplstk> surfdue: WAT
[20:01:27] <smplstk> no you can't.
[20:01:42] <smplstk> impossibru
[20:02:59] <surfdue> no possibru
[20:03:00] <surfdue> :)
[20:04:21] <smplstk> surfdue: JS is clientside, you can't access files from a user's computer with JS
[20:04:25] <smplstk> in the browser
[20:04:29] <smplstk> sorry brah
[20:21:26] <technojoe> Hello.  I'm wondering if something is a bug or not.
[20:22:12] <technojoe> When I goto http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/ and change the Font Size, it changes the font size inside the Tabs component, but not inside the Accordion component.
[20:23:39] <Eviltwin> technojoe: There's an explicit p { font-size 12px; } in base2.css on that page
[20:23:50] <Eviltwin> I'm not sure if it still applies if you download it
[20:25:34] <coldhead> ?tias @ Eviltwin
[20:25:35] <bot-t> Eviltwin, Try It And See
[20:26:05] <Eviltwin> coldhead: ...
[20:26:13] <Eviltwin> coldhead: Try that at technojoe
[20:26:36] <coldhead> ?tias @ everyone
[20:26:37] <bot-t> everyone, Try It And See
[20:26:42] <Eviltwin> Hah
[20:27:56] <technojoe> .ui-widget { font-family: Verdana,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 1.1em; } .ui-widget .ui-widget { font-size: 1em; }
[20:28:14] <technojoe> Sorry, I'm new to this.
[20:28:33] <technojoe> Do these seem to conflict?  I'm just a little sure which I should try chaning?
[20:28:36] <technojoe> *changing?
[20:28:47] <technojoe> *unsure
[20:29:16] <Eviltwin> ?g css selector specificity @ technojoe

[20:30:37] <technojoe> oooooo, thanks
[20:30:51] <coldhead> do you have firebug or chrome web inspector, technojoe? you can right click on an element and choose Inspect... and you should be able to see which rules are applied (and overriden) to that element. that will let you know what you need to change -- and you can edit it in the browser to TIAS

[20:46:56] <Naruto> hello
[20:47:12] <Naruto> i need this 2 query functions to be non - conflict please
[20:47:13] <Naruto> http://pastebin.com/00s54E2e
[20:48:51] <Naruto> any help?
[20:53:39] <Naruto> http://pastebin.com/00s54E2e   need to make the 2 functions non-conflict
[20:59:34] <coldhead> i don't see how they conflict, Naruto
[20:59:42] <coldhead> can you put a working demo up at jsfiddle?
[20:59:46] <coldhead> ?jsfiddle
[20:59:47] <bot-t> jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[21:00:41] <Naruto> http://carladawnbehrlenyc.com/shop/emma-top/
[21:01:39] <coldhead> i think this might be your problem, Naruto http://carladawnbehrlenyc.com/wp-content/themes/starkers-html5/zoom/js/jzomcore.js
[21:01:53] <coldhead> that's the js you're trying to include and it's 404
[21:03:48] <Naruto> ooh
[21:04:37] <Naruto> so, as the js file havent loaded, the tabs arent working? description|more info|some more info
[21:04:50] <coldhead> i'm not sure
[21:05:17] <coldhead> get jqzoom loaded properly and we'll take it from there
[21:07:01] <Naruto> ok
[21:07:36] <Naruto> check now please
[21:08:18] <Naruto> 1sec
[21:09:00] <Naruto> check it now
[21:09:58] <coldhead> the next problem i see is you are loading jQuery twice
[21:10:01] <coldhead> 1.6 and 1.3.2
[21:10:08] <Naruto> ok
[21:10:17] <coldhead> 1.7, rather
[21:10:32] <Naruto> check it now
[21:10:40] <Naruto> i'm using jquery 1.6
[21:10:52] <Naruto> js16.js
[21:11:01] <Naruto> thank you
[21:11:03] <Naruto> solved
[21:11:21] <coldhead> good work, Naruto
[21:11:30] <coldhead> i hope the rest of your project goes well
[21:11:59] <Naruto> yeah
[21:12:02] <Naruto> :)
[21:14:39] <bobbobbins> hey, im using jquery to load in some content via an ajax call, in that content is a pulldown menu with the id table_id...and i've added the code $('#table_id').on('change', function(){do some stuff here}); but it never triggers the onchange. Am i doing something wrong?
[21:16:53] <coldhead> the change event is for input elements in a form
[21:17:02] <coldhead> not for when a DOM node changes
[21:17:43] <coldhead> bobbobbins: can you just do the 'do some stuff here' bit in the ajax callback where you getch the content?
[21:18:07] <bobbobbins> coldhead: its a pulldown menu, it is a form element
[21:18:15] <bobbobbins> a <select>
[21:18:22] <bobbobbins> sorry if that wasn't clear
[21:18:25] <coldhead> i should say it's for when the value is changed by the user
[21:18:38] <coldhead> not when you change the possible things the user can change between
[21:19:00] <coldhead> you might be able to do a simple $('#table_id').trigger('change') in your ajax
[21:19:14] <bobbobbins> but the point is, i want it to go off when the user changes the <select>
[21:19:23] <coldhead> right right right
[21:19:28] <coldhead> that should utterly work then
[21:19:36] <coldhead> when the user changes the selected option
[21:19:37] <coldhead> BAM
[21:19:42] <coldhead> your change handler should fire
[21:19:59] <coldhead> try with something like 'click' instead of 'change'
[21:20:05] <coldhead> and then try clicking
[21:20:07] <bobbobbins> ok, let me try that
[21:20:09] <coldhead> see if that works at least
[21:22:01] <bobbobbins> that doesn't work either
[21:22:04] <surfdue> Eviltwin: plan on launching beta in the next few days if your still in
[21:24:08] <coldhead> do you have this online somewhere, bobbobbins ?
[21:24:26] <bobbobbins> no, unfortunately
[21:24:54] <bobbobbins> im thinking its because of the .load call, but it should work
[21:25:19] <coldhead> bobbobbins: i would check the selector, to make sure you're binding to the right thing
[21:25:36] <coldhead> and then i would ditch the ajax bit and just hardcode the html to see if it works there
[21:26:41] <bobbobbins> ok, let me try that really quick
[21:29:56] <boomsnapclap> hello world :)
[21:31:55] <boomsnapclap> quit
[21:36:07] <coldhead> i'm out of battery, bobbobbins, but the good Eviltwin et al will assist you pleasantly
[21:36:36] <bobbobbins> thanks for your help
[21:44:26] <bobbobbins> yeah, so its working without the ajax bit
[21:46:45] <bobbobbins> this is my load call, maybe im doing something wrong here that could be the problem?
[21:47:03] <bobbobbins> $("<div>").load("import-panel.html", {'data_file': fileObj.filePath, 'data_columns': response}, function() {$(".bigbox").append($(this).html());});
[21:47:29] <Eviltwin> bobbobbins: see ?.load
[21:47:41] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[21:48:04] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[21:48:10] <bot-t> bobbobbins, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[21:50:24] <bobbobbins> well it looks ok to me
[21:50:36] <bobbobbins> i just changed it though to not use the append...it still doesn't work
[21:57:16] <intellilogic> I want to clone something, but also put a <br /> in there, how can I do this?
[21:57:59] <Cork> var clone = $(elm).clond(); clone.append('<br/>')
[21:58:11] <Cork> opps
[21:58:16] <Cork> var clone = $(elm).clone(); clone.append('<br/>')
[22:01:39] <khmer_> var $clone = $(elm).clone().append('<br/>');
[22:01:43] <khmer_> same difference
[22:02:27] <surfdue> I need help with getting zclip working in a jqury dialog. I tried using a similar example from a question on stack overflow with no luck.. here is my code http://jsfiddle.net/JtjzA/1/
[22:02:37] <surfdue> sadly not having any luck :( no alert
[22:10:31] <surfdue> anyone?
[22:26:54] <surfdue> ps i fixed the issue
[22:46:36] <motaka2> I want to send ajax requests each 2 secs
[22:48:17] <LordThumper> Trying to set up an Asp.net Ajax Web Method, however getting "Request header field Content-Type is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers" exception in browser
[22:48:26] <donCams> hello there :)
[22:48:27] <LordThumper> What can the problem be?
[23:28:43] <g1c9> All files are loaded. firebug shows no errors. "modal() is not a function" on call
[23:28:50] <g1c9> what could cause this?
[23:29:11] <g1c9> using simplemodal.js, jquery, and jquery-ui
[23:29:25] <MoTiOnXml> you're not using $() around the element?
[23:30:58] <g1c9> [14:24:37.524] $("#basic-modal-content").modal is not a function @ http://piggybackrider.com/:209
[23:31:03] <g1c9> oops
[23:31:05] <g1c9> whatever
[23:31:32] <g1c9> ( yeah I am using $() )
[23:38:02] <SrPx> hey guys, how do i make jQuery.keydown to happen only once?
[23:38:37] <Cork> ?.one @ SrPx
[23:38:38] <bot-t> SrPx, .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[23:39:55] <gnarf> although that might not quite do what you want
[23:39:59] <SrPx> I mean, once until the key is released, so it wont repeat
[23:40:18] <gnarf> with a keydown you shouldn't get repeat events
[23:40:24] <Cork> keydown doesn't repeat
[23:40:28] <Cork> keypress does
[23:41:24] <Cork> keydown => keypres (loop with repeat interval) => keyup
[23:54:27] <g1c9> il paypal 5$ to anyone who can make the modal appear without breaking something else on piggybackrider.com
[23:54:40] <g1c9> so sick of this project
[23:55:07] <fotoflo> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation <--- is this the best way to do validation these days?
