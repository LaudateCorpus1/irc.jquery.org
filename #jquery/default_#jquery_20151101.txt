[10:35:46] <fas3r> hello
[10:36:27] <fas3r> can I use "push" with an array/obj define like this : var data = { } ?
[11:02:02] <acidjazz> so.. i have a page I want to load w/ my own loader that has a bunch of images loaded via <img>, i want to load them myself via HTML5 Image(), how do i get the <img> tag to only load them after ive cached them via JS?
[11:45:04] <hellyeah> hey
[11:46:16] <hellyeah> i have a script like that button click event is not firing. Can you tell me if you have any particular error or something i missed because i  didnt see any error on the console. http://dpaste.com/1AJSEEG
[12:03:51] <noncom|2> when i call $("#some-id").dropdown() to install some functionality on the component, do subsequent calls install more and more of this functionality or no?
[12:07:12] <noncom|2> if they do, how can i know how many instances are installed?
[12:12:43] <jonez> noncom|2, I would say, "yes" to your question. thus you need to check if it's already been installed before doing it.
[12:14:02] <noncom|2> jonez: do you know the way of knowning this? the plugin is this: https://github.com/CWSpear/bootstrap-hover-dropdown/blob/master/bootstrap-hover-dropdown.js
[12:14:24] <noncom|2> i suppose i should query some property somehow..
[12:14:28] <noncom|2> but what and how..
[12:15:14] <noncom|2> because when react updates my page, i have to reinstall the dopdown functionality on relevant elements, otherwise they won't work
[12:15:52] <noncom|2> (i'm having some dynamic html)
[12:16:24] <noncom|2> but it should not be reinstalled for react calls that don't actually ruin it, so it won't stack up, which is slowing the page down later
[15:32:53] <derekZero_> I found some code on css-tricks on smoothscrolling. Can someone help me understand the difference between the two hrefs in 'a[href*=#]:not([href=#])'?
[15:34:24] <derekZero_> Is that a before the href not referring to link, and actually an anchor?
[15:35:27] <derekZero_> #jquery I need you
[15:36:02] * derekZero_ this isn't the #jquery derekZero_ deserves, but it's the #jquery derekZero_ needs. 
[15:36:21] <derekZero_> #jquery... Gotham needs you.
[15:36:24] <decx> any link thats href contains # but is not just #
[15:36:48] <derekZero_> thx decx
[15:38:07] <derekZero_> So I need to create a smoothscroll function for each href?
[15:38:30] <decx> no idea
[15:39:44] <derekZero_> I'm trying to learn how to apply this https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/
[15:40:11] <decx> dont bother, it's a terrible script
[15:40:41] <derekZero_> You know a better smoothscroll technique?
[15:41:00] <decx> yeah dont do it
[15:41:10] <derekZero_> Why not?
[15:41:25] <decx> it's annoying and has no benefit
[15:41:50] <derekZero_> I think it would be a wise move with a fixed nav on a single page parallax site.
[15:42:36] <decx> a good parallax site won't happen with some script from css tricks
[15:42:56] <decx> what's it called
[15:42:58] <decx> waypoints.js?
[15:43:04] <derekZero_> ?
[15:43:12] <decx> that's a good lib i think
[15:43:12] <derekZero_> What's waypoints.js?
[15:43:48] <decx> also, i'd come back tomorrow, this channel is dead on weekends
[15:44:45] <derekZero_> decx could you give me your criticism for mid-development rapidscribe.org ?
[15:45:06] <derekZero_> It's missing a background image because the back-end of the host is down... meh
[15:45:27] <derekZero_> Behind the order form.
[15:46:15] <derekZero_> I think smoothsroll would be useful here, no?
[15:47:24] <decx> i hate all of it ^^
[15:48:14] <derekZero_> decx Do you have a url of a site you think does this better?
[15:48:48] <derekZero_> I appreciate your feedback.
[15:49:18] <decx> well there are tons of sites that follow this formula and i hate all of them
[15:49:35] <decx> here's an amazing example of a functional site based on this principle http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/27/world/greenland-is-melting-away.html
[15:49:46] <derekZero_> I'll take a look
[15:53:45] <derekZero_> decx Do you have an appreciation for parallax effects beyond zooming google maps, and video? I thought it was impressive. I'd be interested in pages that expand on it. Do you discourage objects moving around the screen in general?
[15:54:16] <decx> it's appropriate when it's a benefit to the point of the page
[15:56:27] <decx> or as a tour like here http://www.giampierobodino.com/ but almost never to convey some basic information
[15:56:39] <derekZero_> I'll take a look
[15:58:12] <derekZero_> That's really impressive
[15:58:19] <decx> there was some story that used it as a visual medium
[15:58:21] <decx> what was it
[15:58:24] <decx> boat something
[15:58:35] <decx> http://www.sbs.com.au/theboat/
[16:00:12] <derekZero_> thx I'll check it out
[16:03:37] <derekZero_> decx Also very impressive. What role do you think jQuery plays in building service-based sites?
[16:04:04] <derekZero_> Also, I feel very compelled to know what happens at the end of this story now...
[16:07:59] <decx> jquery plays its role by manipulating the dom in an easy accessible way ^^
[16:08:21] <derekZero_> Well that's certainly what it does.
[16:08:44] <decx> but moving stuff around based on scroll and user interaction is finicky business that requires a lot of effort
[16:08:56] <decx> unless you want some prebaked boring eyecandy
[16:11:22] <derekZero_> Sounds like the ideal is that the scroll effects be cohesive and point to the same thing... I like it.
[16:13:21] <decx> well, my ideal. a billion pages that use parallax and weird popins when you scroll them into view say otherwise ^^
[16:51:39] <redlizard> Greetings. Is there a way to trigger a piece of code when a particular DOM node is removed?
[16:51:44] <redlizard> I found a thread that refers to jquery-ui's "remove" event, but it appears to be completely undocumented.
[17:13:19] <ashgotti> Hello all. I need a bit of help populating fields based on other fields: I have applicants who can have multiple addresses. If they're spouses are added, I need to 1. create as many addresses as the applicant 2. populate the addressfields. Basically clone the applicant's addresses.
[17:14:00] <ashgotti> I'm thinking I'll look through the address wrappers and count how many there are, then add them. After that, I'm not sure how to Map them (1.A to 2.A, 1.B to 2.B, etc)
[17:19:34] <ashgotti> related question: Am I able to find an element based on it's value? Like find the parent div of the select field wiht the value 'foo'.
[17:21:48] <ashgotti> nm, I can use :input[value="foo"] in the selector
[17:25:04] <robhol> that... REALLY sounds like you're doing something weird
[17:27:06] <robhol> as for the mappings, it's a bit hard to tell also. Depends on how you've laid them out in the DOM itself, but generally you'd expect "element #2 in the first row corresponds with element #2 in the second row" or vice-versa :p
[17:28:28] <ashgotti> robhol: thanks, I always have trouble trying to explain what I'm trying to do. It's a loan application so I can apply and say that I'm married and my spouse is included. When I pick those options, another applicant is automatically added labelled as my spouse. (this works). Now what I'm trying to do is autopopulate my wife's residence fields as the same as mine.
[17:29:44] <ashgotti> It uses ajax to add multiple addressfields, so you click '+' and it adds another set of addessfields.
[17:30:58] <robhol> I'm not sure where ajax comes in, you mean you're adding them with js? Ajax usually refers specifically to doing HTTP requests
[17:31:44] <robhol> anyway, it's hard to get any more specific without looking at the code. jsfiddle seems to be the usual way for this channel
[17:32:00] <ashgotti> robhol: appreciate the help. It's tough to share code because I'm building this using Drupal
[17:33:25] <robhol> right. Type up a quick mock using the same basic structure then.
[17:36:57] <ashgotti> I'm breaking down everyting I need to do into small chunks to develop. I can count how many addresses the applicant has. I need to "click" the add button on the second applicant based on that number. Any idea how to use trigger with a number?
[17:39:44] <alberto> trigger with a number ?
[17:40:24] <ashgotti> I need to trigger 'mousedown' on a button X amount of times.
[17:40:41] <alberto> to submit something ?
[17:41:17] <ashgotti> Yes and no, every time the button is clicked, fields are added to my form.
[17:41:46] <alberto> based on a input type number/text ?
[17:43:17] <alberto> how do you determinate the number of time that this button need to be clicked ?
[17:43:25] <alberto> with a checkbox, input ?
[17:43:51] <alberto> after a form is submited ?
[17:43:58] <ashgotti> I use .length on the wrapper around addressfields so it returns the number of addresses
[17:44:25] <ashgotti> When the user checks "autofill addresses", I count the number of addresses and need to trigger the button that adds more fields
[17:45:22] <ashgotti> I may actually be getting somewhere using something like $(addresses).map(function(index){ });
[17:45:40] <alberto> ashgotti: in that case use each ... $('.yourclasstoidentifyaddrfield').each(function) { $("#idofyourbutton).trigger('click'); });
[17:46:28] <ashgotti> alberto: thank you! I'll try
[17:46:42] <alberto> ashgotti: in worst case a simple loop ...
[18:03:58] <ashgotti> hmmm any tips of chaining events with multiple ajaxcompletes? i.e click button (ajax fires), ajaxcomplete, click button (ajax fires again), ajaxcomplete
[20:18:16] <drkshadow> I'm doing $(node).position().left and getting values like 192, but position is supposed to be within the parent -- and I'm expecting this to be left-aligned (with a 2px margin). What's up?
[20:21:53] <drkshadow> Well I think I've figured that out. $(node).position().left + margin == $(node).offset.left. Possibly because floating element.. *shakes head*
[21:14:04] <VectorX> jQuery(".price[data-currency='"+currency+"'").each(function(){  but get Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: .currency-price[data-currency='euro'  in safari
[21:14:26] <VectorX> sorry .price[data-currency='euro'  in safari
[21:15:00] <drkshadow> well for one you're lacking the ]
[21:15:32] <VectorX> that would do it
[21:15:34] <VectorX> thanks
[21:48:23] <aro> i have a question regarding bootstrap, is this the right place to go
