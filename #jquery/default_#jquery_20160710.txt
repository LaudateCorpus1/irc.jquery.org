[00:05:25] <warden23> Hello :) Could someone please help me with how to select the top link if it has the same value as the bottom one? http://jsfiddle.net/n7VMY/18/
[00:06:08] <warden23> So if the href link (The DEF) with the value of 01 adds the red class to the Item 2 <a href="01"> at the top?
[00:06:17] <warden23> Not sure what I have done wrong?
[00:07:24] <warden23> Tried changing text() to if($info.val()==$thisdivlink.val()){ also but this just adds it to all of them lol
[00:08:29] <warden23> Sorry my markup was wrong forgot to add values to the top one: please view now: http://jsfiddle.net/n7VMY/19/
[00:13:30] <warden23> I'm sure I'm trying to select the 'value' from the links incorrectly?
[00:15:32] <warden23> I also tried the value selector like .num a[value] but that did nothing :(
[00:19:04] <warden23> Also tried this: if $(".num a[value]") == $(".mcdiv[value]") { $(this).addClass ( 'red' ); }
[00:19:26] <warden23> Any help is greatly welcome ;) even if it's just directional
[00:35:26] <Mark___> anybody want to create a cool site together? (supposdely better than reddit in everyway)

[12:43:01] <LeGorille> Hi, is there a way I can get the names of all element with id starting with a set of caracters ??

[12:46:05] <LeGorille> I really need your help guys

[18:06:49] * sportman waves
[18:07:15] <sportman> so i have a div with scrollable content inside on the start of user scrolling i want the div to expand with jquery animate
[18:07:44] <sportman> what i notice though if i use jQuery('#element').scroll(function to animate height here);
[18:07:52] <sportman> it stops scrolling as soon as the animation starts
[18:08:42] <sportman> is the solution just adding an extra div on top of the scroller? or is there a more elegant way?
[18:12:28] * sportman whistles a nice tune
[18:36:02] <sportman> my idea worked yay
[18:36:03] <sportman> bbl
