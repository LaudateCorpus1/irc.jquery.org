[06:55:59] <ksau> Hi, is the jquery forum down? https://forum.jquery.com/ shows issues with zodo.com...
[07:00:35] <ksau> Can anybody copy me...?

[15:23:40] <baruna> https://jsfiddle.net/zy8ub7f9/1/ < any idea why the $('#vsechny_data').submit(); doesn't work in the SubmitForm() ?
[15:24:48] <baruna> is the problem that I want to submit the form with a link though I have another <input type="submit" ?
[15:26:05] <baruna> I've found online that submit() doesn't work with either name="submit" or id="submit" but I don't have those
[17:27:15] <shoky_> baruna: you're navigating to a new url, after submitting the form, so it cancels the submit action (or part of it)
[17:28:11] <shoky_> also you should add an 'event' argument to your click handler function
[18:33:25] <baruna> well that's the idea, to submit the button and than to navigate to new url...
[18:53:09] <shoky> baruna: submitting a form is also navigation to a new url. you can't navigate twice at the same time. you might want to change the form submission to an ajax request, then navigate only after the ajax request is done
[18:56:04] <baruna> shoky: something like $.when( { SubmitForm } ).done(function( x ) {   var url = $('#last_link').attr('href'); window.location.href = url;}); ?
[18:56:28] <shoky> no.. that's not an ajax request
[18:56:53] <baruna> no idea, I'm not familiar with ajax at all :D
[18:58:32] <shoky> baruna:  $.ajax({url: ..., method: 'POST', data: $('#theForm').serialize()}).then(function() { window.location.href = ...; })
[18:58:39] <shoky> baruna: that _might_ work
[18:58:55] <baruna> shoky: thank you!!
[19:05:01] <baruna> shoky: doesn't work though
[19:06:20] <shoky> baruna: bummer.  donno what you did exactly
[19:06:37] <shoky> and what "doesn't work" means
[19:09:58] <baruna> shoky: well I apologize, I made some other typo.. it works!! thank you!!!
[19:10:13] <shoky> nice
[19:12:33] <baruna> I'm acutally surprised that it's much faster than "regularly" submitting the form via button
[19:12:43] <baruna> with no ajax
