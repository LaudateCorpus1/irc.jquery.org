[00:03:32] <Nebros> i have a request to the server, the server loads all data (this takes about 10sec) and make a render to response. the page itself display the data faster than one second. is it posible to let the server send fragments he have loadet?
[00:14:13] <Caelum> does ie8 not have bind?
[00:15:07] <Zak> Caelum: http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/
[00:15:09] <Zak> (no)
[00:15:29] <Zak> how do you solve that? shim it. https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim
[00:16:48] <Cork> Caelum: no
[00:17:09] <Cork> oh already answered :x
[00:20:21] <Cork> or just use $.proxy
[00:21:44] <Nebros> whn windows is loading, the mouse become a new symbol for background activity. can i implement a similar function for my page, when its loading?
[00:24:03] <tiphares> Cork imagesloaded worked perfectly!
[00:24:28] <Cork> tiphares: that was gnarf's tip
[00:25:03] <Caelum> oh fuck, jquery latest breaks on IE
[00:25:09] <octatone> Hey guys, anyone know how to work around the new 1.9 behaviors with .after, .before and replacWith when working with disconnect nodes (e.g. tamplating) ? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14374325/how-to-work-around-new-after-before-behavior-with-disconnected-nodes-in-jquer
[00:26:17] <gnarf> Caelum: you should be using jquery 1.9 for ie<9
[00:26:29] <gnarf> Caelum: jquery 2.0 is the "ES5" version of 1.9
[00:27:36] <Cork> oooh NICE
[00:27:58] <Cork> but didn't you mean ie<=9 ?
[00:28:20] <Cork> cause if my memory isn't failing me ie9 doesn't have addEventListener
[00:28:25] <tiphares> Cork right, thanks gnarf then!
[00:28:48] <Nebros> when windows is loading, the mouse become a new symbol for background activity. can i implement a similar function for my page, when its loading?
[00:28:51] <kerozene> Cork: ie <= 8 aren't supported. wasn't aware of a problem with 9
[00:29:00] <gnarf> octatone: .add() is the answer
[00:29:09] <gnarf> octatone: added a comment on the existing answer
[00:29:11] <Cork> kerozene: i don't clame anything it was more of a question
[00:29:28] <Cork> kerozene: it was purly from the ES5 comment
[00:29:46] <kerozene> gotcha
[00:30:01] <octatone> awesome gnarl, thanks :)
[00:30:06] <octatone> er gnarf
[00:30:23] <octatone> how about for replaceWith?
[00:30:32] <octatone> what would be an equivelent?
[00:30:36] <octatone> for a disconnected node
[00:30:38] <gnarf> on disconnected?
[00:30:45] <octatone> yeah
[00:30:46] <gnarf> if it doesn't have a parent, you can't really replace it
[00:31:12] <octatone> why does it need a parent, I literally want to replace the object
[00:31:21] <octatone> that seems silly
[00:31:25] <gnarf> append em all to a $("<div>") and replaceWith should work fine
[00:31:36] <octatone> that's write more code, not less
[00:31:41] <octatone> against the $ mantra
[00:31:42] <octatone> :P
[00:31:59] <gnarf> octatone: fiddle link?
[00:33:12] <gnarf> octatone: really tho using a $("<div>") ass a "workspace" and using .append() etc on it the .children().appendTo() makes a lot of sense
[00:33:15] <octatone> http://jsfiddle.net/octatone/Jxwfw/
[00:33:30] <octatone> that works fine in $ 1.8.3
[00:33:44] <octatone> but for 1.9 I have to create workspaces every time I want to work outside the DOM?
[00:33:50] <octatone> redonk
[00:35:09] <gnarf> octatone: so um
[00:35:18] <gnarf> why not just use $after ?
[00:35:55] <octatone> this is just an example fiddle, but I literally in some circumstances need to replace a disconnected node with another node
[00:36:13] <octatone> e.g. iterating over objects and replacing with templates, etc.
[00:36:23] <gnarf> octatone: I assume this disconnected node has a parent, or you wouldn't need to "replace" it, nor would you be able to use replaceWith on it
[00:36:32] <octatone> no it has no parent
[00:36:44] <gnarf> octatone: can you give a better use-case example then?
[00:36:44] <octatone> It could a template I am waiting to add to the dom
[00:36:44] <scathen^C> if you are replacing, why not just use the replacement?
[00:36:57] <gnarf> octatone: i see where you're coming from
[00:37:15] <gnarf> but i'm having trouble understanding how you could $node.replaceWith( ... ) to usefulness
[00:37:22] <gnarf> instead of $node = $after
[00:37:33] <dobalina> hey... is it possible that if jquery is referenced on a site pointing to the google cdn hosted version that if it's updated the site breaks?  ie. some functions stop working etc.
[00:37:42] <scathen^C> = is a replacement in this case.
[00:37:50] <dobalina> or is there supposed to be some sort of backwards compatibility ?
[00:38:15] <gnarf> dobalina: you shouldn't ever link to version /1/ ... use the "minor" numbers, 1.8 for instance
[00:38:46] <gnarf> dobalina: many features were removed in jQuery 1.9 - read the upgrade guide on the blog http://blog.jquery.com/2013/01/15/jquery-1-9-final-jquery-2-0-beta-migrate-final-released/
[00:39:03] <gnarf> dobalina: these features have been deprecated for a long time, but people still use them
[00:39:11] <octatone> Say I have a template that is compiled into some html, I convert it to a disconnect node.  I want to iterate over its children looking for some node that should be replaced with another generated template that is also disconnected.
[00:39:15] <gnarf> dobalina: there is a plugin called "migrate" which can help you find them
[00:39:18] <octatone> I can't do this anymore using replacewith.
[00:39:30] <gnarf> octatone: so "some node" that needs to be replaced has a parent now
[00:39:43] <gnarf> octatone: at least it seems like it does
[00:39:45] <Nebros> how can i implement a function like this: style="cursor: progress;" when my page is loading?
[00:40:18] <octatone> hrm, I'll see If i can find an example where it breaks and come back.
[00:40:26] <gnarf> octatone: better example on the fiddle would def help me here
[00:40:28] <octatone> anyway, thanks for the work around for .after gnarf
[00:40:32] <octatone> yeah, totally
[00:40:35] <gnarf> octatone: try to be "quickish" tho
[00:40:35] <octatone> bbiab
[00:40:37] <gnarf> :)
[00:40:43] <gnarf> im out in a few minutes
[00:40:50] <gnarf> wanted to go to bed :40 ago
[00:41:00] <dobalina> gnarf what sort of plugin?
[00:41:02] <gnarf> but been too busy with plugins.jquery.com stuff
[00:41:14] <gnarf> dobalina: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/
[00:42:46] <gnarf> dobalina: but you really shouldn't be using "version 1" of jquery, its not 100% api stable... use minor versions, those stay api stable (for the most part, except when we fuck it up)
[00:43:27] <mindis|wurk> yeah, i noticed. i upgraded from 1.8.0 to 1.8.3 and suddenly shit started blowing up
[00:44:01] <gnarf> mindis|wurk: within 1.8.x ? what broke?
[00:45:57] <Caelum> well jquery latest is blowing up on IE10 too for me, this line: //@ sourceMappingURL=jquery.min.map
[00:46:33] <Caelum> google says it's serving 1.9.0
[00:47:40] <gnarf> Caelum: um, that makes no sense, its breaking on a comment?
[00:47:42] <dobalina> gnarf - gotcha ... basically ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js will always point to the latest version right?  so it can break stuff on sites unless the code is updated...
[00:47:43] <czytacz> hi, is there a way to use toggle function for one class of many? I have an element that has class="class1 class2" and I want to toggle only class2
[00:48:00] <gnarf> dobalina: yeah, use /1.8/jquery.min.js for example instead
[00:48:14] <gnarf> czytacz: .toggleClass("class2")
[00:48:32] <czytacz> well, it didnt work.
[00:48:41] <czytacz> wait, Ill jsfiddle it
[00:48:41] <gnarf> ?doesn't work
[00:48:42] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[00:48:45] <gnarf> :)
[00:49:35] <mindis|wurk> gnarf i don't know unfortunately but iirc i got type errors at least
[00:49:49] <mindis|wurk> i already reverted back to 1.8.0
[00:50:04] <gnarf> mindis|wurk: thats a shame, i love to know when things break
[00:50:13] <gnarf> helps me spot other issues later
[00:51:44] <mindis|wurk> for my latest work (which is a rewrite of one of the projects that blew up with 1.8.3) i'm using 1.8.3 and no problems so far
[00:52:00] <czytacz> god, im stupid in the mornings
[00:52:31] <rindolf> Hi all.
[00:53:21] <czytacz> I started copying the code to jsfiddle and found out I had a style display:none for this class. I put it there yesterday during tests :)
[00:57:14] <Caelum> gnarf: that's what developer tools says
[00:57:40] <gnarf> Caelum: i wish i had ie10, i'd take a look at it
[00:57:43] <czytacz> but since im here, I have another question just out of curiousity. Is it possible to resize a div AND its content? I would like to have a similar effect to when I change the size of an image with animate function i.e.: animate({height:height, width:'0px'},500)
[00:57:58] <gnarf> Caelum: have you looked on bugs.jquery.com by chance?
[00:58:01] <rindolf> Caelum: hi.
[00:58:29] <gnarf> czytacz: animate can work on multiple elements at once
[00:58:54] <gnarf> czytacz: and there are ways to make css do that, like make the image 100%/100% and animate the container
[00:59:58] <Caelum> rindolf: hi
[01:00:04] <czytacz> gnarf: yes I know, but when there is text inside the div, it won't ger thinner, right? I can only make it smaller. What I want to achieve is to 'squeeze' the element
[01:00:21] <rindolf> Caelum: what's up?
[01:00:36] <gnarf> czytacz: so, you can do that with css3 transforms where supported
[01:00:57] <gnarf> czytacz: but i would suggest using css3 animations / transitions to pull it off as well
[01:01:01] <gnarf> instead of jQuery
[01:01:16] <gnarf> you can control animation/transitions with addClass/removeClass
[01:01:32] <czytacz> gnarf: well, that's the problem. This mus work on all leading browsers. css3 is not yet fully supported
[01:01:51] <gnarf> `caniuse transform
[01:02:08] <gnarf> http://caniuse.com/transforms2d
[01:02:29] <gnarf> czytacz: IE9
[01:02:30] <Caelum> gnarf: apparently it's just the .min.js the regular .js works fine
[01:02:41] <gnarf> Caelum: the "regular" doesn't have a source map
[01:03:06] <gnarf> Caelum: can you test loading those same files locally?
[01:03:13] <gnarf> save the .map too?
[01:03:18] <gnarf> i'm just curious now
[01:04:36] <Caelum> gnarf: after I make sure I don't fuck up our production website
[01:04:45] <Caelum> gnarf: that's more important
[01:05:01] <gnarf> Caelum: a) try only loading jquery in a blank page :)
[01:05:09] <gnarf> Caelum: see if error still happens
[01:05:15] <gnarf> don't want you testing on live - lol
[01:05:29] <coppa> hello people
[01:05:42] <czytacz> gnarf: unfortunately ie8 is still the case :(
[01:06:03] <Caelum> gnarf: the problem is probably these templates loading jquery twice
[01:06:19] <gnarf> czytacz: so, can your ie8 users get a slightly degraded form of the animation for their inferior browsers? :)
[01:06:56] <gnarf> czytacz: basically, it will look like poop if you try to do it without css transform2d at least
[01:07:56] <gnarf> czytacz: this is just speaking from experience.  I maintain the jQuery UI Effects code, and core animation code for the most part, so trust me :)
[01:08:56] <Nebros> is there someone with know a little about jquery AND django?
[01:09:27] <Suhana> nebros, I mix them a fair bit
[01:09:42] <czytacz> gnarf: i trust you :) I guess it'll have to wait then. It messes my plans a bit, but I have a plan for a workaround
[01:10:10] <Nebros> Suhana can i query you?
[01:10:19] <johanhar> I have got an object where I bind an element in the constructor to a function that is not in the prototype of that object. How can I pass along the context (this) to be the object so that the handler can say this.prop instead of context being the element bound? Thanks
[01:10:26] <Suhana> fire away Nebros
[01:10:59] <Nebros> what means fire away? ^^
[01:11:12] <Suhana> "yes"
[01:11:26] <Nebros> it make no sense when i translate it in german. xD but ok thx
[01:12:09] <aquatix> Nebros: i think it roughly translates to "geht loss"
[01:12:23] <aquatix> as in "just do it"
[01:18:32] <Cork> Nebros: i think one thing you could try look at for a similar meaning would be "free-fire"
[01:19:26] <Cork> less slang then fire away
[01:21:58] <Nebros> :)
[01:22:30] <Nebros> translation word by word want work here... :)
[01:23:07] <rootcoma> cant you set enctype using $.post()? I want to post a file.
[01:36:32] <szonek> any idea why slidedown('slow') shows all the content instantly instead of sliding it down? http://wieszjakjest.net/easy/ (click on "read more" in capabilities section)
[01:36:46] <szonek> it works just fine with other sections
[01:39:45] <czytacz> szonek: like I told you yesterday - in this section You change layout of elements and the right panel appears. This messes up the situation I guess
[01:44:06] <szonek> czytacz: yeah i guess, one workaround which i can think of is to hardcode the height of div after slidedown, but it's as elegant as i would like it to be
[01:44:26] <czytacz> szonek: this div is set to fade in. Maybe roll in would change sth
[01:45:04] <szonek> but it's not as elegant*
[01:46:53] <szonek> czytacz: probably i could mess a little bit with css, for example have overflow:hidden on containing div and try to do it this way
[01:47:23] <szonek> czytacz: but there's a problem with the right "read more ..." button
[01:47:47] <szonek> which would be cut off because of overflow:hidden
[01:48:47] <Caelum> what is "unexpected call to method or property access"
[01:55:55] <shoky> Caelum: what line's causing it
[01:56:19] <Caelum> shoky: appendChild inside jquery.js
[01:56:43] <Caelum> shoky: it's ok, it seems when I turn on script debugging half our site goes to shit anyway, I will deal with it another day
[01:57:16] <shoky> need to see the callstack for it
[01:58:55] <Caelum> the callstack functionality in IE8 is not very helpful
[02:13:53] <Ange7> hi all
[02:14:39] <Ange7> someone can say me why if i make var link = $('<a>'); link.data('foo', 'bar'); don't work ? (data not set...)
[02:15:51] <szonek> Ange7: make it $('a');
[02:16:07] <Ange7> i try
[02:16:37] <Ange7> don't work
[02:16:40] <Ange7> jquery 1.8
[02:18:27] <szonek> Ange7: var link = $('a'); jQuery.data(link, 'foo', 'bar');
[02:22:23] <Ange7> don't work szonek ... :x
[02:25:38] <szonek> Ange7: works for me, show me your source
[02:25:59] <szonek> Ange7: http://jsfiddle.net/bbF2B/
[02:33:25] <shoky> $('<a>') is fine..
[02:33:39] <shoky> and it works with that too:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/bbF2B/3/
[02:34:01] <shoky> if you're expecting it to add a data-XXX attribute to the element, then don't ;p
[02:34:23] <fairuz> Hi guys. Question on jQuery mobile. I have this error : cannot call methods on popup prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'close'. I don't quite understand why I have this error?  I do have data-role="popup" for the popup divs.

[03:06:53] <blackspotwiggins> vlad_starkov, just appendTo without copying should work
[03:07:05] <MoTiOnXml> clone doesn't move :)
[03:07:15] <vlad_starkov> blackspotwiggins: ok
[03:07:17] <vlad_starkov> Thnx!

[03:15:40] <Nece228> hi
[03:15:51] <Nece228> any good file uploading plugins with progress bars and stuff?
[03:39:10] <asker> hey guys i cant get the height of my viewport :(
[03:39:22] <asker> console.log($(window).height() + " " + $(document).height());
[03:39:40] <asker> output: 3020 3020 <-- my browser isnt 3020 height :(
[03:39:59] <asker> somebody has an idea?
[03:40:00] <mindis|wurk> sounds like the height of the page
[03:40:25] <asker> it is, but how i supposed to get the height of the viewport?
[03:43:44] <mindis|wurk> $(window).height() should return it. maybe your browser is doing it wrong?
[03:44:04] <asker> let me check it on ff, sec
[03:45:08] <asker> ff same
[03:45:36] <asker> $(window).height() -> 3020 window.innerHeight -> 611 (the proper height)
[03:45:37] <asker> hmmm
[03:47:27] <danielhq> febba
[03:50:45] <FernandoBasso> $('.menu').click(function() { console.log($(this) + '> .sub_menu'}). I want something like that, to match '.sub_menu' which are children of $(this).
[03:50:55] <FernandoBasso> That is not correct, just to illustrate.
[03:51:27] <shoky> ?children
[03:51:28] <bot-t> .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[03:51:30] <shoky> ?find
[03:51:30] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[03:52:19] <FernandoBasso> Got it. Thanks.
[03:52:23] <flat_eric> hey guys, do someone of u have an idea how to save the current view in fullcalendar to get back after creating an event. e. g. when i create an event in weekview, the page refresh and switch back to default-view (e.g. month view). after refreshing the page i wanna switch back to the previous view. i deliberated to save the current view in a sessionvar to use the method changeView after. is this possible? can someone help please? :)
[03:56:59] <juha_> i think it's funny that jquery.com uses version 1.4.2
[03:59:06] <Trisoxf> juha_: agreed
[04:07:52] <FernandoBasso> How do I prevent that the sub menu closes when I click on "Listar" or "Novo"? http://jsfiddle.net/2MHbt/
[04:08:49] <FernandoBasso> Because since the sub-items are inside <ul>, clicking on them is the same as clicking on <ul>. Am I right?
[04:10:03] <shoky> FernandoBasso: this is one way http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/2MHbt/1/
[04:11:56] <FernandoBasso> Cool. Thanks.
[04:12:13] <shoky> FernandoBasso: i prefer this tho  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/2MHbt/2/
[04:13:13] <shoky> er could be shorter http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/2MHbt/3/
[04:14:34] <flat_eric> someone any ideas please? :)
[04:15:14] <FernandoBasso> shoky: I couldn't come up with one single solution, and you comes up with three?! That is unfair. :D
[04:15:23] <FernandoBasso> s/comes/come/
[04:15:28] <shoky> ;]
[04:15:36] <shoky> i got more if you want ;D
[04:16:02] <FernandoBasso> shoky: Please, tell me what book you studied.
[04:16:17] <FernandoBasso> I want to learn the ways of the force too.
[04:17:58] <fairuz> Hi guys. Which one is better for a mobile app using jquery mobile? have different physical page (index.html / setting.html etc) or a single index.html with divs that has date-role="page" ? Thanks
[04:18:03] <shoky> FernandoBasso: its mostly cause i hang out here too much ;p
[04:23:30] <FernandoBasso> the one with .header makes the html more semantic too, I think.
[04:26:24] <shoky> yea, and bare text nodes like that are smelly
[04:27:11] <FernandoBasso> Agreed.
[04:28:00] <FernandoBasso> Thanks once more.
[04:28:47] <shoky> np
[04:32:24] <FernandoBasso> shoky: Your name will be history. You are going to show up in my commit message anytime someones sees the log for this commit.

[04:53:06] <Lipathor> i'm loading some content using .load() and CSS is not applied tp this content
[04:53:14] <Lipathor> stylesheet is already loaded
[04:53:31] <shoky> then it doesnt fit the css selectors you've used
[04:53:38] <Lipathor> it does
[04:53:53] <Lipathor> that was my first shot

[04:54:23] <Lipathor> and click >Blog
[04:54:54] <shoky> ok
[04:55:56] <shoky> and?
[04:56:33] <Lipathor> and css is not applied to blog posts
[04:56:40] <shoky> what css?
[04:56:44] <shoky> and what elements exactly
[04:56:49] <shoky> am i supposed to guess ;p
[04:56:59] <Lipathor> damn, you're right :)
[04:57:30] <Lipathor> eg. Jak bezboleśnie wprowadzić AteGood w życiu zapracowanego AteMe link
[04:58:06] <shoky> ok, what css isnt applied? where's the selector?
[04:58:22] <Lipathor> #app-home #wrapper.app-home-blog #core #blog-entries article header h1 a {
[04:58:22] <Lipathor>     color: #dbe11d;
[04:58:22] <Lipathor>     text-decoration: none; }
[04:59:05] <shoky> ok, #wrapper doesnt have app-home-blog class
[04:59:09] <shoky> so the selector is failing.
[05:00:04] <Lipathor> damn... gonna kill front-end-man
[05:02:00] <Lipathor> thanks shoky
[05:02:32] <Lipathor> i'll really kill him, or he will make next webpage using assembler
[05:34:31] <der_On> hi. i need to detect if the virtual keyboard on an ios device is active. I've got it working for android using the resize event, but ios does not work this way.
[05:36:58] <FernandoBasso> I have a left navigation menu. It has submenus that are opened and closed at users' will on click. However, when a sub-menu is clicked, it triggers an action that redirects the user to a certain page. How to make the 'page' remember which menus were open by the user, and keep them open after reloads?
[05:49:47] <masentinel900> Hello guys!!
[05:51:14] <masentinel900> I'm doing a jquery function for to show a div when the mouse is hover a tag, but now I want to put that when the mouse is not hover in the tag the div hidden
[05:51:45] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/DRwmh/
[06:02:24] <shoky> masentinel900: here's 2 ways  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/DRwmh/1/   http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/DRwmh/2/
[06:10:15] <masentinel900> shoky: see :: http://jsfiddle.net/kQZQe/
[06:11:17] <shoky_> masentinel900: that's wrong..
[06:11:23] <masentinel900> But I want can select an option of the div that show, but whe I hover in the div hidde
[06:12:55] <shoky_> english would be useful
[06:13:16] <shoky_> read what .hover does if you only give it one argument:
[06:13:19] <shoky_> ?hover @ masentinel900
[06:13:20] <bot-t> masentinel900, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[06:13:26] <shoky_> (go to that link)
[06:14:31] <shoky_> you can fix your last fiddle by changing 'hover' to 'mouseover'
[06:19:47] <masentinel900> <shoky_>: ok , ready. But how can I for that the div that show stay here when the mouse in over of there
[06:20:27] <shoky_> wat.
[06:20:58] <shoky_> put the html and css in the fiddle so i can see what you're talking about
[06:22:12] <fission6> whats a solid alternative to jsfiddle, its been pissingme off lately, anyone else?
[06:22:23] <shoky_> jsbin
[06:23:03] <shoky_> and jsfiddle has been pissing off many
[06:23:22] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/eySqM/
[06:23:27] <masentinel900> There is the script.
[06:23:37] <masentinel900> Is for may select an option of the div!!
[06:23:53] <fission6> shoky_ why is that, lately its just been a mess
[06:25:54] <komplex-> is there a JQ plugin that will let me use like templates that I can load into a page? I have a long form and need to add multiple fields to it for each client. I wanna do a plus or minus button for the user to add new fields to add more clients at once.
[06:26:09] <shoky_> fission6: i donno im not their spokesperson ;p
[06:27:10] <shoky_> komplex- there are tons of client-side templating libraries
[06:28:34] <shoky_> komplex- popular ones are mustache and handlebars
[06:29:29] <komplex-> shoky_ ahh! Thank you! I will check those out. I am more of a PHP guy and starting to get more into client-side coding.
[06:32:00] <komplex-> shoky_ was trying to do it in knockout but was having some issues. these libs you pointed me to are exactly what I need! thanks again!
[06:33:27] <shoky_> komplex-: i can probably help you with knockout issues ;p
[06:36:09] <NET||abuse> hi folks, i'm trying to debug an async post request to a dataset generator, but it's burried deep in an application process and it fires once and the process moves on, i have to roll back the applications data and re run the whole page request to get this one post to happen
[06:36:55] <NET||abuse> is there a way to take the request in chrome inspector and use that as the basis for some kind of postman like app that can take the params of the post and repeat the call at will?
[06:37:22] <NET||abuse> there's this thing int he context menu of chrome which says save as .har, but i'm not sure if there's any way to use that to reproduce the ajax call.
[06:37:42] <keirlav87> i am using resizable and draggable on the same div, but even though I have set maxHeight of resizable to 500, it won't resize anywhere below the bottom half of its bounding area, has anyone run across this problem before?
[06:38:35] <shoky> ?demo @ keirlav87
[06:38:41] <bot-t> keirlav87, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:43:05] <DeltaHeavy> I'm having an issue getting a div to stick to the top of a page. I'm using this plugin: http://labs.anthonygarand.com/sticky and this is the page I'm trying to apply it on: http://staging.decorgroupinc.com/store/firewood-bricks/index.php   The problem should be pretty obvious when you try to scroll. Anybody know how I can fix this?
[06:45:32] <keirlav87> http://jsfiddle.net/tBVPB/2/ < same result in jsfiddle - i can't resize my div past a certain point within its container even though it should be able to resize to the full height of the container
[06:47:59] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: what exactly is it that you want to be sticky?
[06:48:50] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: After grinding at this for ~2.5 hours I fixed it up. Thanks for your effort though!
[06:48:59] <DeltaHeavy> It was the 'Buy Product' banner
[06:49:17] <komplex-> shoky http://jsfiddle.net/eGWKS/ here is the fiddle for that problem I was telling you about. I can add the initial forms but after that the add and remove links dont work
[06:56:15] <DeltaHeavy> Is it good practice to put the event handler (assuming I'm talking about the right thing) in for every event? eg: $('#thing').click(function(e) {    Where what I'm talking about is 'e'
[06:56:26] <DeltaHeavy> Or should I only do it as needed?
[06:57:36] <jklaus> what is the difference between:  $('#id').attr('value','myvaluehere'); and $('#id)[0].value = 'myvaluehere';
[06:58:12] <jklaus> when I try to set the value of an input via attr('value'...) it doesn' ttake
[06:58:22] <shoky> one sets an attribute, the other a property
[06:58:22] <jklaus> visually at least
[06:58:37] <jklaus> ahhh
[06:58:40] <shoky> use .val() to set the value
[06:58:58] <jklaus> sob..
[06:58:59] <jklaus> lol
[06:59:31] <jklaus> shoky.. I feel rather stupid now
[06:59:33] <jklaus> but thanks!
[06:59:54] <shoky> dont.. attributes vs properties is pretty confusing
[07:00:59] <jklaus> shoky.. what is the exact difference?
[07:03:55] <shoky> in general, attributes are attributed to HTML tags like href here <a href="">, and properties are associated with the run-time DOM nodes (the in-memory objects)
[07:04:15] <keirlav87> can anyone spot why I cannot resize the div in this fiddle to a greater size than roughly half of the container div - it's supposed to be the full height of the container
[07:04:17] <keirlav87> http://jsfiddle.net/tBVPB/2/
[07:04:39] <shoky> many attributes get copied to their corresponding property, and browsers also copy back changes in properties to the attributes, so it can get confusing
[07:04:48] <Fenikkusu> Could I please get some opinions on this code? Primarily from a structure and best-practices point of view. http://jsfiddle.net/8dgpq/2/
[07:04:53] <Rajni> does someone work with iscroll4 jquery ?
[07:05:20] <shoky> but in general if you want to make to the DOM from javascript you do it by setting properties, not attributes
[07:09:43] <keirlav87> noone's going to come to my rescue with this resizing thing, are they? :p
[07:11:15] <shoky> i'm trying, keirlav87
[07:12:07] <shoky> first problem is that the div doesnt have any predefined dimensions
[07:12:10] <Fenikkusu> keirlav87, I may be mistaken on this but if memory serves me correctly, divs naturally shrink to the smallest size possible without any size specifications. Since your going off your master div size, my guess is that you need force the size of master, or instead use the window for the height.
[07:12:32] <keirlav87> thank you :) it's very perplexing for a noob like me, and i'm very appreciative of any help

[07:17:09] <naveko> hi everybody
[07:17:51] <shoky> keirlav87: it works ok like this http://jsbin.com/isekij/1/edit  but adding the 'helper' option causes it to fuckup
[07:17:57] <naveko> I keep getting an error message on this line of code: elem[ jQuery.expando ] = id = ++jQuery.uuid;
[07:18:43] <keirlav87> :I how strange
[07:18:48] <shoky> naveko: what error message? and what browser
[07:19:02] <keirlav87> but thanks, that will definitely do in a pinch
[07:19:03] <Trudko> If I want to know how tools like these are made http://store.nike.com/fr/fr_fr/product/free-run-id-running-shoe/builder/?debug=true what to look for? This is done in flash, what would be general concept if I wanted to do this in javascript?
[07:19:09] <naveko> shoky: IE7
[07:19:31] <naveko> shoky: that's what the client uses unfortunately
[07:20:24] <shoky> keirlav87: actually seems #p1boundingBox only needs 'width:100%' for it to work.. weird
[07:20:25] <true_techie> !doc
[07:20:26] <keirlav87> Trudko: i'm actually making a very simple version of this type of tool at the minute, albeit im at a very early stage
[07:20:48] <naveko> the error message is: Object doesn't support this property or method
[07:20:58] <shoky> naveko: what jquery version is that?
[07:21:06] <true_techie> is there a doc that talks about the selectors? it had a yellow content table
[07:21:09] <naveko> shoky: v1.4.4
[07:21:30] <shoky> naveko: ok.. no idea ;]
[07:21:47] <Trudko> keirlav87: do tell more :) what exactly are you trying to do? and what is oficial name for this type of apps so I can google it ? :D
[07:21:57] <naveko> shoky: no problem
[07:22:54] <keirlav87> i'm making a module for opencart that will enable users to create custom designed mug's, mousemats, tshirts etc within a fairly limited scope
[07:23:32] <shoky> naveko: do you know what line in your code is causing it?
[07:23:47] <keirlav87> shoky: thanks, very much appreciated
[07:24:06] <hugo_moss> how can you pass a function and its parameters from a function to another function?
[07:24:23] <naveko> shoky: I suspect something, but I am not sure
[07:24:58] <khmer> hugo_moss: if you want to bundle up a function and some of its parameters, google "currying"
[07:25:10] <hugo_moss> ok
[07:25:13] <hugo_moss> thank you
[07:25:29] <naveko> shoky: I think this must be it: http://pastebin.com/JcQX8N8Q
[07:26:34] <Trudko> keirlav87:  interesting, I am asking because I might need to get something like this done but for different item so could you give me some tips what to look for? (learning source)
[07:27:21] <Trudko> i do know javascript css etc I am not sure how would I approach such an app
[07:27:22] <shoky> ?g mdn bind @ hugo_moss
[07:27:23] <bot-t> hugo_moss, bind - JavaScript | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[07:34:28] <shoky> komplex-: you'll have to provide a simpler minimal testcase if you want help with that ko stuff.. also, the bottom 3 lines in the fiddle code are totally wrong
[07:35:03] <komplex-> shoky I will shrink down the forms and take a look at the btm code
[07:35:14] <shoky> the use of delegate is wrong
[07:35:25] <shoky> and ViewModel.removeChild(ko.dataFor(this));   is wrong
[07:35:36] <shoky> ViewModel  is not an object, it's a function
[07:35:55] <shoky> it's not the viewmodel instance, that is
[07:36:55] <shoky> also there's no removeChild function in the viewmodel
[07:37:28] <hugo_moss> thanks shoky
[07:37:30] <shoky> oh and there's no .removeChild elements
[07:37:33] <hugo_moss> i never knew about bind
[07:37:40] <hugo_moss> i heard of it
[07:37:44] <hugo_moss> but never used it
[07:37:57] <shoky> use teh bind
[07:39:57] <zafu> hi, can I compute the md5 sum of an image in javascript?
[07:40:35] <StanAccy> Im trying to copy text entered in to an <input> in to a <span> as the user types it.  However, my copying is 1 character delayed - see here: http://tinkerbin.com/B8TWHzjb
[07:40:49] <StanAccy> its like the event is firing before the value of the input has been updated - can I get around this?
[07:41:13] <hugo_moss> shoky what does the bind in jquery do
[07:41:13] <scar> is there any reason console.log($(".my-form").serialize()); inside of a ajax call that processes a form shwos a blank line in console? can't figure out why this isn't working haha.
[07:42:15] <scar> empty string
[07:43:17] <shoky> ?bind @ hugo_moss

[07:43:48] <komplex-> shoky cant seem to get the add / remove links working under the form dupes
[07:44:00] <melter> it looks like the new plugins.jquery.com site has a minor layout issue if the plugin has no description: http://plugins.jquery.com/tag/ui/
[07:44:07] <StanAccy> so when my keypress() event fires, how do I get at the value of the current text in an input element?
[07:44:37] <StanAccy> and not what the value was prior to the event firing
[07:45:54] <shoky> komplex-: the html there is fudged up.. dont click TidyUp ;]
[07:46:09] <shoky> man jsfiddle sucks :\
[07:46:56] <komplex-> shoky ahh! ok. lemme repaste it
[07:51:06] <shoky> komplex-: you need to give me a new link
[07:51:15] <shoky> jsfiddle needs help
[07:51:15] <komplex-> shoky.. oh ok!

[07:55:00] <Trudko> keirlav87: hmm? are you here
[07:55:38] <komplex-> shoky thats the thing… im not sure how to tell it to remove the fieldset by the remove link
[07:55:51] <shoky> komplex-:  there is no remChild function anywhere in your fiddle
[07:56:31] <komplex-> shoky i had removed them as they werent working… i had: self.remChild = function(item) {self.child.remove(item);}
[08:00:19] <shoky> probably you just need to reference $root.remChild  in your binding
[08:01:57] <shoky> komplex-: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/DYDWQ/3/

[08:34:25] <jklaus> what is the correct term to use to describe an object you get from this $('#id')  vs the object you get from this $('#id')[0] (or document.getElementById(id))
[08:35:12] <shoky> the first is a "jquery object" , the 2nd is a DOM node
[08:37:39] <jklaus> shoky, thanks.. trying to learn the terms
[08:38:39] <shoky> jquery objects "wrap" DOM nodes/elements

[08:39:23] <juria_roberts> jquery has onprogress and onComplete for upload what is there for before preogress?
[08:39:59] <BillCriswell_> Damn. I've multiplied.
[08:40:09] <shoky> Raydiation: neither of those options touch any headers, i believe
[08:40:32] <shoky> unless you mean something other than HTTP headers..
[08:40:40] <Raydiation> shoky: no
[08:40:58] <Raydiation> im trying to get fileupload via angularjs working, but i only find jquery solutions
[08:41:35] <shoky> shrugs
[08:41:35] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[08:42:19] <BillCriswell_> That face is so funny.
[08:42:26] <marlun> If I've got jquery object of an <ul> element and I want to get the <li> with a specific data-attribute, is $ul.children('[data-attr="value"]') the way that does least amount of work? I thought of find() first but that would search the <li> elements children too and I don't want that.
[08:43:43] <tlkr> marlun, you've just answered your own question.
[08:44:20] <tlkr> you are right
[08:45:11] <rjanja> marlun, if it was me I'd probably use filter() with a function that checks and compares the data() on the <li>'s. the speed difference isn't going to be that much.
[08:46:00] <marlun> ok, thanks! :)
[08:47:02] <tlkr> rjanja, why would you select all of the li's then filter them rather than just selecting the correct ones in the first place? I fail to see the point.
[08:49:20] <thaifood> Hi,  Anyone know how to lazy load with requirejs ?
[08:50:20] <rjanja> tlkr, either way you're traversing the dom
[08:51:29] <rjanja> tlkr, comparing the data via selector is only going to be a minor improvement at the cost of readability
[08:52:20] <fALSO_> Hi, anyone here users jQuery Validation ?
[08:52:30] <fALSO_> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[08:52:50] <fALSO_> the example shows that its possible to define the validations via css classes
[08:53:05] <fALSO_> but there isnt a list of the classes or how to use the ones that have arguments anyhere
[08:53:35] <fALSO_> anyone knows where i can get that?
[08:55:03] <tlkr> rjanja, my way you traverse the dom once, your way you traverse the same dom then apply a function to the results. The performance is not the issue as the different will be negligible. In what way is using a filter increase readability?
[08:56:01] <njasm> fALSO_, vai-te deitar
[08:56:09] <NoiseEee> i'm with tlkr

[08:57:23] <thisboy> Hello
[08:57:28] <Rajni> Can anyone help me.. im looking for a caroucel touch menu, i got iscroll4 working but when i drag something it triggers the click event, and i just want to trigger the click when the intention isnt to drag
[08:57:36] <rjanja> tlkr, I suppose you'd have to write it out both ways to see the difference, but it's going to look a lot clearer without a potentially 90-character width selector
[08:58:52] <andrew9184> is there a plugin that does this scrolling when you click the nav menu here: http://nissan.ca/vehicles/ms/pathfinder/en/index.html#interior
[08:59:53] <rjanja> tlkr, and as marlun was talking about making this comparison over and over, the elements would best be selected and stored, and the filter applied each time a new search needs to be executed
[09:00:01] <BillCriswell_> andrew9184: Looks like scroll spy. You can look into jquery waypoints.
[09:00:16] <thang> Rajni: i ran into a similar issue a while ago, what i ended up doing was capturing the drag event and preventDefault for the specific area i didnt want them dragging in
[09:01:33] <Rajni> im getting my head blown with this :( .. all the dragging stuff is ok, the clicking is the problem.. i need to click to drag and thats the problem
[09:03:05] <tlkr> rjanja, ok. He didn't specify the number of comparisons required, however I'll agree that in the case where multiple filters are required a filter would be more effective.
[09:03:15] <andrew9184> BillCriswell_: thanks, but I mean the actual scrolling when you click a div
[09:03:19] <andrew9184> i mean menu item
[09:05:44] <BillCriswell_> andrew9184: There's a scrollTo plugin that should help. You could accomplish it pretty easily without a plugin though.
[09:06:27] <rjanja> tlkr, well now that I look back I don't see him mentioning the need to search more than once. I suppose it might be just a personal preference then
[09:07:10] <tlkr> maybe we should have sex
[09:07:16] * tlkr goes too far
[09:08:10] <BillCriswell_> andrew9184: http://www.abeautifulsite.net/blog/2010/01/smoothly-scroll-to-an-element-without-a-jquery-plugin/ this is what I was thinking.
[09:09:02] <rjanja> tlkr, hehe well as with everything there's more than one way to get the result you're going for. here, you'll need to buy me dinner first
[09:12:06] <chrisbolton_> Looking for best practice. I've got a photo with comments listed under it. I'm currently limiting the comments to 5 with a link to display all comments. How would you handle that as I'd like it to be ajaxy (no page reloads)?
[09:12:20] <billy_ran_away> Can anyone help me finish my jQuery droppable drop function in this jsfiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/UMNcY/6/ I'm trying to be able to re-arrange the red blocks, but not on top of each other...
[09:26:47] <DukeDrake> hi
[09:27:19] <DukeDrake> how can I check wether one radio button from a group was selected at all?
[09:28:43] <Brodingo> ?checked
[09:28:43] <bot-t> :checked: Matches all elements that are checked. http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[09:30:45] <Trudko> keirlav87:  Hi, sorry I got to go before we finished our conversation are you here?\
[09:31:06] <DukeDrake> k =)
[09:31:23] <phiz> i want to do a .get() off of a parameter i have in window.location.search that i put in a variable already
[09:31:59] <phiz> so i have var blah = window.location.search $.get('get.php',{blah: 1}, ... );
[09:32:26] <phiz> but it is passing blah instead of the value of blah
[09:36:04] <BillCriswell_> phiz: Why do you want to pass the window location search as a key? Seems to be like you want { location: blah }
[09:37:31] <Aamir> anyone has idea about this:     rendered a string using jquery template. IE8: http://cl.ly/MFti (noSpacing)     vs FF: http://cl.ly/MF1h
[09:37:59] <on3pk> Hey guys, is it possible to use an outside javascript file in conjunction with jquery?
[09:38:15] <Aamir> ?getscript @on3pk
[09:38:15] <bot-t> on3pk, jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[09:39:16] <on3pk> Aamir, would that let me access functions in the outside library?
[09:39:35] <Aamir> wat???
[09:39:38] <BillCriswell_> on3pk: You can do that or just include it just like jQuery and use it.
[09:40:18] <on3pk> Hm.  Well, I mean, use the functions within a jquery event...
[09:40:55] <BillCriswell_> on3pk: Just pass what you need to the function.
[09:41:07] <on3pk> that works
[09:41:31] <BillCriswell_> $('form').on('submit', function(e){ functionFromOutSideScript(e);
[09:41:34] <BillCriswell_> });
[09:41:49] <BillCriswell_> That looks like a sad monster emoticon. I like it.
[09:50:29] <billy_ran_away> Can anyone recommend a jQuery plugin to rearrange this images in these grid columns pictured here: http://cl.ly/MEl0 ?
[09:51:25] <BillCriswell_> billy_ran_away: Rearrange?
[09:51:30] <Brodingo> billy_ran_away ummmm masonry maybe?
[09:51:55] <BillCriswell_> If you want them evenly distributed Masonry will definitely do the trick.
[09:52:08] <billy_ran_away> I mean letting the user do it. I've messed with sortable, but since I can many different sizes of the components it's a lot of extra work.
[09:52:26] <billy_ran_away> I'm letting the user decide where to mount those servers.
[09:53:40] <billy_ran_away> Brodingo: masonry is more about static arrangements right? Not letting the user arrange them dynmanically, additionally the user should be able to create "gaps"
[09:53:51] <Brodingo> afaik yes
[09:53:51] <billy_ran_away> Hence gridster doesn't really work for me either.
[09:54:55] <thaifood> I'm trying to get requirejs to lazy load my js files,  i'm loading the config file and I thought it would let me define module names and then load them with a require statement but i'm missing something.  http://fpaste.org/mf5i/
[09:58:42] <thaifood> oh got it
[09:58:48] <lonejack> Hi folks, can someone help me on how to build an horizontal menu by jquery 1.9.x? On the demo(http://jqueryui.com/menu/) it is shown a vertical type, thank you....
[09:59:22] <[jmc]> lonejack, tried making it wide and short?
[09:59:28] <billy_ran_away> lonejack: I'd check out Twitter bootstrap honestly...
[10:03:21] <lonejack> [jmc], consider me a newbie on jq. What do you mean for "wide". It this an option or you mean I've to set some tags in a specific way? Thank you
[10:05:06] <[jmc]> lonejack, I'm a newbie too :P but try this, if your menu is inside a <ul>, style that <ul> so that is expands horizontally more than vertically
[10:05:33] <[jmc]> in CSS, e.g., ul { width: 100%; }
[10:07:08] <lonejack> [jmc], okay. I tought was possible to this modifying some options on menu call
[10:07:13] <Brodingo> actually since ULs are block elements its more important so you have to make sure your list items are inline
[10:07:17] <lonejack> [jmc], thank you
[10:07:26] <Brodingo> i accidentally a word
[10:07:41] <keirlav87> is there a way to delay keyup so it will only fire if the time between keyups is say a second?
[10:07:56] <Brodingo> either inline, inline-block or floated
[10:08:03] <keirlav87> i don't want to bind to change, but don't want to fire every keyup if the person is a fast typer either
[10:08:11] <Brodingo> keirlav87 setTimeout
[10:08:22] <[jmc]> Brodingo, right
[10:08:38] <Brodingo> set a timeout and clear it on each new keypress
[10:08:47] <Brodingo> i believe this is referred to as debouncing
[10:09:12] <keirlav87> thanks guys
[10:09:26] <Brodingo> youre welcome guys
[10:11:20] <aro> is there a way to iterate over groups of radio buttons?
[10:11:43] <Brodingo> ?each
[10:11:43] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[10:11:48] <Brodingo> ?attribute selector

[10:12:43] <Brodingo> thaifood trying to show him the way, not mock him

[10:13:24] <thaifood> correct you are
[10:14:37] <star_prone> hi
[10:14:53] <star_prone> how can I add an event to an element added on the page using javascript?
[10:14:55] <rindolf> star_prone: hi.
[10:15:02] <rindolf> star_prone: by its ID.
[10:15:13] <rindolf> star_prone: it's not different than other elements.
[10:15:29] <rindolf> star_prone: but you need to add it to the DOM first.
[10:15:32] <star_prone> it is if the element didn't exist on the page when the page was loaded
[10:15:35] <star_prone> ok
[10:15:40] <star_prone> how do I do that
[10:15:41] <star_prone> ?
[10:15:59] <star_prone> I did it with append
[10:16:06] <rindolf> star_prone: $('#myid').onmouse(. ... )
[10:17:00] <Brodingo> ummm
[10:17:05] <Brodingo> ?on
[10:17:05] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:17:49] <Brodingo> rindolf its not just by ID and onmouse is not a jquery method
[10:18:10] <rindolf> Brodingo: OK, sorry, was inventing syntax.
[10:18:31] <star_prone> is not working with on
[10:18:32] <rindolf> Brodingo: and I know it's not just by ID - any CSS selector will do.
[10:18:45] <star_prone> I know that there is a way but I can't remeber it :((((
[10:19:16] <thaifood> Anyone here recommend a good lazy loader ?
[10:19:30] <Brodingo> rindolf for future elements you have to delegate to a parent container
[10:19:36] <Brodingo> err sorry, star_prone
[10:20:04] <Brodingo> otherwise it tries to direct bind to an element (that may not be there)
[10:20:06] <star_prone> how do I do that?
[10:20:45] <Brodingo> in the docs you can see an example of selecting a parents and then passing the element to be delegated to
[10:21:27] <Brodingo> $("#dataTable tbody").on("click", "tr", function(...)});
[10:31:01] <aro> thanks for all your input, sarcastic or not sarcastic, but you didnt answer my question
[10:31:20] <aro> i know how to use .each, i know how to use :radio, but what i want to do is iterate over blocks of radios at a time
[10:31:50] <aro> so say i have 3 checkboxes in a legend/fieldset - and i have 4 of thos efieldsets - i want to iterate over 4 objects essentially
[10:32:02] <aro> so that i can pick the 'selected' state of that fieldset and apply a class if necessary
[10:32:09] <Brodingo> but you said radios
[10:32:32] <aro> yes, am i not being clear?
[10:32:47] <aro> i dont want to iterate over individual checkboxes, i want to select a group of checkboxes
[10:33:05] <Brodingo> and how would you group them
[10:33:08] <aro> erm
[10:33:08] <aro> damn
[10:33:09] <aro> sorry
[10:33:11] <aro> raidio buttons
[10:33:14] <aro> not checkboxes
[10:33:17] <aro> force of habit
[10:33:43] <Brodingo> its ok, be careful with lots of line entries, you might get spam kicked
[10:33:55] <aro> noted :)
[10:34:39] <Brodingo> so im sure however youre grouping your radios theres a way to select them, pasting some code might help
[10:35:08] <aro> well, they have common name elements
[10:35:13] <aro> attributes*
[10:37:40] <Brodingo> so you really want to iterate over the fieldset and find the checked radio
[10:37:58] <Brodingo> non?
[10:44:05] <aro> Brodingo: yes
[10:45:27] <keirlav87> if i am taking the value of a textarea and placing it into a p is there any way to maintain linebreaks?
[10:46:33] <Trudko> hi keirlav87  , how did you trying to implement the tool for mug tshirt customization etc ? what should I  look for?
[10:47:03] <billy_ran_away> Anyone know of a good jQuery sortable type plugin that allows you to leave gaps between sorted items? I've been trying to do setup this jsfiddle, http://cl.ly/MFxk, to be able to arrange these guys on the rows, http://cl.ly/MEl0
[10:47:14] <aro> keirlav87: do a regex replace on newline chars and replace with <br/>
[10:47:21] <BillCriswell> kerozene: You can replace \n with <br>.
[10:48:14] <aro> Brodingo: the only problem is, i dont have fieldsets, they are in table rows
[10:49:25] <Brodingo> as long as theres a common parent element
[10:50:53] <aro> tr?
[10:51:07] <billy_ran_away> Hmm… I wonder if I could just set the draggables to be a grid and stop messing with li's as a grid...
[10:54:20] <aro> so is it better to iterate over the tr's?
[10:57:12] <iman> hi, I create a json request and send it to server successfully then i send a new json as result from server, but what I get as alarm is [Object] and what I get in firebug.Net is a json
[10:57:19] <iman> this is my code  			$.ajax({
[10:57:19] <iman> 				type : "POST",
[10:57:19] <iman> 				contentType: 'application/json;charset=UTF-8',
[10:57:19] <iman> 				url : "/"+chType,
[10:57:19] <iman> 				dataType : "json",
[10:57:20] <iman> 				data: JSON.stringify($("#accountChargeForm").serializeObject()),
[10:57:22] <iman> 				success : function(result) {
[10:57:24] <iman> 					var data = jQuery.parseJSON(+result);
[10:57:33] <iman>               		alert(data);
[10:57:33] <iman> 				},
[10:57:33] <iman> 				error : function (err){
[10:57:33] <iman> 					alert(err);
[10:58:05] <BillCriswell> iman: You shoudl paste that online somewhere.
[10:58:06] <iman> 				}
[10:58:06] <iman> 			});
[10:58:06] <iman> sorry, http://jsfiddle.net/7vpQg/
[10:58:16] <BillCriswell> Things like that put people into a blind fit or rage in here.
[10:58:42] <iman> BillCriswell: yes, I paste it here suddenly, sorry
[10:58:50] <raj> iman, use console.log() instead of alert()
[10:58:51] <iman> I paste it here http://jsfiddle.net/7vpQg/
[10:59:04] <BillCriswell> iman: Why +result? That's new to me.
[10:59:56] <iman> BillCriswell: it's wrong, i remove some character but I forgot to remove that
[11:00:14] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone im prototyping some functionality for a search form here
[11:00:15] <jarr0dsz> http://jsfiddle.net/N9weY/1/
[11:00:41] <jarr0dsz> anyone an idea how i could approach this? I could use a toggle div to show hide search_advanched but how about moving a div  to bottom of another div, or any other toughts?
[11:01:31] <raj> jarr0dsz, I'm not clear on what you want to do
[11:02:39] <iman> raj: it works in console.log(), what is different between console.log() and  alert()?
[11:02:49] <BillCriswell> jarr0dsz: It sounds like you want some CSS?
[11:02:58] <jarr0dsz> http://jsfiddle.net/N9weY/3/ forgot to add the jquery to jsfiddle
[11:03:06] <raj> iman, alert is not made for debugging
[11:03:26] <jarr0dsz> its not clear from my example? i want to click that grey block, than i replace search div with search_advanched ( show / hide )
[11:03:29] <iman> raj: thank you anyway dude
[11:03:31] <raj> don't know about browser internals to answer you properly though
[11:03:41] <jarr0dsz> then i want to move the grey #expand to bottom of search_advanched div
[11:06:03] <iman> raj: how can I find what is an object type with jquery
[11:06:21] <iman> raj: in java, there are something like, something.getClass()
[11:06:52] <Brodingo> ?g javascript typeof
[11:06:53] <bot-t> Brodingo, The typeof operator - JavaScript Kit - http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/determinevar2.shtml
[11:07:38] <jarr0dsz> ok it works somewhat now http://jsfiddle.net/N9weY/4/
[11:07:44] <iman> Brodingo: thank you :)
[11:08:04] <jarr0dsz> would i just be replacing that text on #expand div to "basic search" and i think its ok- any thougts on the example ( click the grey box )
[11:08:09] <Brodingo> yay
[11:08:13] <jarr0dsz> can i improve this ?
[11:09:47] <aro> is there a callback funciton for $.each that gets called when the collection is complete being iterated over?
[11:10:23] <Brodingo> well each is synchrous soooo
[11:10:25] <Brodingo> after?
[11:11:12] <BillCriswell> aro: If you're doing ajax requests in there and waiting for them to finish you might want to look into when().
[11:13:38] <Trudko> Guys I would like to create something like this http://store.nike.com/fr/fr_fr/product/free-run-id-running-shoe/builder/?debug=true but in pure javascript what should I use , does jquery provide enough tools for this? SOmeone recomended me using canvas
[11:15:30] <jarr0dsz> anyone knows how you can toggle text?
[11:15:37] <jarr0dsz> i find some examples on stack but they are vague
[11:15:45] <NoiseEee> what does 'toggle text' mean jarr0dsz?
[11:15:53] <jarr0dsz> like a reguar .toggleClass but that for text
[11:16:02] <Brodingo> Trudko with complex hit areas like that canvas might be a good choice
[11:16:03] <jarr0dsz> NoiseEee: so you can toggle between 2 text strings
[11:16:06] <BillCriswell> $('.elementWithText').toggleClass('visible')
[11:16:38] <Trudko> Brodingo by hit are you mean places where i can select and then change their color like for example laces on shoe in case of Nike?
[11:16:40] <raj> Trudko, nice example...I was thinking about a way to do this about a month ago
[11:16:50] <NoiseEee> jarr0dsz: you'd write your own function for that.
[11:16:54] <Brodingo> Trudko yes exactly
[11:17:05] <jarr0dsz> like http://jsfiddle.net/N9weY/5/
[11:17:14] <jarr0dsz> NoiseEee: so that if the box is red it shows "basic search"
[11:17:25] <Brodingo> or like nike you could use…. *shudder*…. flash
[11:17:25] <raj> Brodingo, what about the shadows, etc?
[11:17:28] <raj> it's not a solid color
[11:17:32] <Trudko> Broding could there be any problem with older browser? i foun some backard compatibility librariy but I am not sure if it worsk.
[11:17:45] <Trudko> raj  and did you do it ? :)
[11:18:01] <Trudko> Broding nah I dont know flash and mobile phones dont support it AFAIK
[11:18:05] <raj> Trudko, no I didn't, I was just pre-planning for a future project
[11:18:18] <jarr0dsz> NoiseEee: hmz could you point me in right direction how to write such a custom method?
[11:18:24] <alchemia> I will just leave this here http://rezoner.net/labs/calculate/
[11:18:25] <LindsayMac> Hey guys. I'm having a really dumb issue that cropped up when I had to put some JS in noConflic mode and need a little help again. I am getting NO errors at all and all javascript functions are working EXCEPT the biggest, most important one and that is my smooth scrolling
[11:18:32] <LindsayMac> http://www.millwrightsrestaurant.com/#team
[11:18:45] <LindsayMac> any help is HUGELY appreciated on this.
[11:19:09] <Trudko> raj did you came up with anything? where should I look for?
[11:21:17] <Brodingo> LindsayMac shits whack yo, show() be messin stuff up or somethin
[11:21:30] <LindsayMac> Brodingo:  show() is???
[11:21:33] <Trudko> btw isnt something like this already done in js?
[11:21:48] <Brodingo> seems like it, after the window loads things be changing around
[11:22:01] <Brodingo> then stuff just doesnt respond
[11:22:01] <LindsayMac> Brodingo:  the "show()" function is just to let the site load in the BG and then show
[11:22:39] <LindsayMac> Brodingo:  it was working before I had to activate the annoying obtuse WOOCOMMERCE plugin, which caused JS conflicts. It's now all in noconflict and not working on chrime, but working on FF
[11:22:53] <LindsayMac> also, it was working in ALLbrowsers before I activated the theme
[11:22:54] <LindsayMac> Brodingo:
[11:23:08] <Brodingo> this is a tangled web youve woven
[11:23:18] <LindsayMac> Brodingo:  i know.. i know.. and I learned my lesson on it for sure!
[11:23:55] <LindsayMac> but it DEFINITELY works in FF but not in Chrome.. and it seemingly has to do with some conflicts between the scripts in woocommerce because as soon as I deactivate that plugin, it all works again
[11:24:17] <LindsayMac> the lesson i learned is to leave the heavy jquery stuff to the pros and stick with back end dev
[11:25:00] <jarr0dsz> NoiseEee: this is what I came up with http://jsfiddle.net/N9weY/7/
[11:25:05] <thedjb> is it possible to bind a function to run AFTER an event fires .. i.e. <a id="test" onclick="alert('2')">test</a> $('#test').on('click', function(e){ alert('1'); }
[11:25:20] <jarr0dsz> im not that of jquery coder its only issue with that code is the text "advanched search" is also in the html
[11:25:34] <jarr0dsz> so duplicate, anyone idea how i could improve this?
[11:31:00] <LindsayMac> anyoen here? or did everyone leave? ha
[11:32:28] <TelFiRE> People idle
[11:32:46] <LindsayMac> i think it was a mass exodus..
[11:35:56] <raj> any aussie's?
[11:37:03] <BillCriswell> I've withstood the split.
[11:43:47] <mengu> hi. i have a callback function for a click event. and i do $.post in that function. however each time i click it, it runs $.post n + 1 times.
[11:44:08] <mengu> however when i do console.log, it only prints once
[11:44:15] <mengu> has anyone faced a problem like this
[11:46:43] <mengu> hmm, nope. console.log is also called n + 1 times.
[11:47:00] <danheberden> mengu: i suspect you are somehow re-binding the click handler
[11:47:14] <mengu> so the problem is, my click callback is being called more than once
[11:47:16] <danheberden> so that when you click, you're adding *another* click handler, so that next time it fires twice
[11:47:22] <danheberden> then 3 times
[11:47:25] <danheberden> etc
[11:47:31] <LindsayMac> Ahh i really have no answers for this! An entire chunk of JS will not work only in Chrome and only when another plugin is activated.
[11:48:40] <LindsayMac> I have my code wrapped in noconflict using jQuery(document).ready(function($) { and all works fine in noConlict mode, but when I activate this darn WP plugin it is somehow conflicing with my JS
[11:49:42] <Brodingo>  LindsayMac  are you actually aliasing jquery with noconflict?
[11:50:35] <Brodingo> or calling it before loading another $
[11:51:18] <LindsayMac> honestly, I'm just getting into javasript and a little confused abotu the different methods of working with conflicts
[11:54:00] <LindsayMac> Brodingo:  but basically I am justing making it use jQuery instead of $ which is what I was assuming was causing the conflicts
[11:54:00] <Brodingo> dear god there are a lot of js files here
[11:54:05] <djQuery> I am modifying jquery.ui.dialog   I am making the title button to work like the buttons option.
[11:54:17] <LindsayMac> Brodingo:  i know i know. a good majority of them are called by the woocommerce plugin and gravity forms plugin
[11:55:20] <Kalculus> So I have a string in a javascript variable.  How do I properly escape the single quotes (and any other characters) so that it can be used as a javascript string?   So basically, i have javascript generating HTML that has a link w/ javascript in it
[11:55:34] <djQuery> LindsayMac, if the plugins are initialized correctly there will be no ussie eliminating the global var $
[11:55:52] <djQuery> ^^ issue not ussie
[11:55:54] <LindsayMac> djQuery: not sure what you mean...
[11:56:13] <djQuery>  Brodingo:  but basically I am justing making it use jQuery instead of $ which is what I was assuming was causing the conflicts
[11:56:16] <Brodingo> Kalculus instead of doing that can you not do that? and use event delegation?
[11:56:53] <djQuery> sorry just joining so may be coming lat to the convo
[11:57:02] <LindsayMac> djQuery:  yea I dont know what you mean by initialized correctly.
[11:57:10] <LindsayMac> djQuery:  here's the issue in a nutshell:
[11:57:30] <LindsayMac> djQuery:  I have a site with a LOT of js going on. Its one of the first heavy JS sites i've ever done (i generally do back end stuff)
[11:57:36] <Brodingo> LindsayMac theres two errors if you look in the resources tab
[11:57:55] <LindsayMac> djQuery:  Everything works fine until I actually activate the woocommerce plugin, so I assume there's a conflict
[11:58:02] <LindsayMac> Brodingo:  there is? I am looking now
[11:58:17] <djQuery> link?
[11:58:31] <LindsayMac> djQuery: http://www.millwrightsrestaurant.com/
[11:58:37] <LindsayMac> Brodingo: I dont see an error there
[11:59:12] <LindsayMac> http://cl.ly/image/0O3Y3J2b4423
[11:59:44] <shader> does .load() use get or post when you provide data?
[12:00:08] <djQuery>  LindsayMac (function($){//plugin defined here }(jQuery)     this is how plugins are defined.
[12:00:29] <sisb> Any front-end developer students looking for an internship in this channel lol?  Bay area (San Mateo)  Pm me
[12:00:30] <Kalculus> Brodingo: I don't think so.  I don't think the event would be able to access the parameters
[12:00:59] <LindsayMac> djQuery:  but I dont see how I could control that seeing as the plugins are entirely separate from my "theme"
[12:01:05] <djQuery> I see no errors in the console related to javascripts
[12:01:09] <LindsayMac> and the plugins work fine on their own. I am certain it is issues with my code
[12:01:36] <djQuery> there are 2 webfont errors but no javascript errors
[12:01:37] <LindsayMac> ok yea. So the error thing ISN'T just me.. There are no errors, and that is why I'm really lost here
[12:01:54] <djQuery> so which part isnt working
[12:02:11] <LindsayMac> djQuery:  when you click on a link up top it should smooth scroll in to the proper location
[12:02:24] <LindsayMac> djQuery:  if you view it in FF you can see it working just fine BTW
[12:03:58] <djQuery> LindsayMac,  well in chrome it seems that most of the links at the top are not working dont have IE to test there
[12:04:42] <LindsayMac> djQuery: right. THAT is the problem. The links that don't work are the links that use the smooth scroll function
[12:04:55] <LindsayMac> (they link to a div ID and animate the scrolling effect)
[12:06:17] <djQuery> shader, not sure why dont you turn on the network tab of the dev tools in google chrome and test it real quick, sorry I just dont remember
[12:06:34] <djQuery> LindsayMac, not loading at all now
[12:06:35] <shader> good point
[12:07:05] <LindsayMac> djQuery:  the site isn't loading at all in general?
[12:07:31] <djQuery> LindsayMac, just getting the progressbar
[12:07:44] <LindsayMac> djQuery:  hmm thats odd. Its working for me. Try a refresh again?
[12:08:11] <djQuery> LindsayMac, came up that time
[12:08:32] <LindsayMac> its currently using CloudFlare and it's been glitchy and thinking abotu taking it off of that. It could have been that
[12:09:45] <LindsayMac> this is really confounding!
[12:12:17] <shader> djQuery: if you're interested, it's get without data and post with
[12:12:35] <djQuery> shader, cool thanks
[12:13:31] <djQuery> LindsayMac, sorry I gots no idears, I dont see any error messages regarding javascript when loading or when clicking
[12:13:44] <djQuery> back to hacking ui.dialog
[12:13:46] <LindsayMac> djQuery:  AHHHH thats not what I want to hear!! hah
[12:13:58] <LindsayMac> but thanks for looking.. i am SOOO darn confused
[12:14:32] <djQuery> LindsayMac, it kinda hard sometimes when everything runs in an iframe
[12:14:51] <LindsayMac> djQuery:  everything isn't running in an iframe?
[12:15:05] <LindsayMac> djQuery:  nothing is in an iframe (except a google map that I commented out)
[12:20:00] <LindsayMac> djQuery:  what made you think anything was inside an iframe?!
[12:20:08] <NoiseEee> LindsayMac: hard to make sense of a mess.  for one, you're loading "chosen" twice.  "chosen.jquery.min.js?ver=1.6.5.1" and   "chosen.jquery.min.js?ver=3.5"
[12:20:52] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  sadly that is the PLUGIN the client wants.. No me
[12:20:59] <NoiseEee> well you don't need it twice
[12:21:25] <NoiseEee> (at different versions, too, from what i can see)
[12:21:40] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  i know.. I need to get in to the plugin core and clean it.
[12:22:36] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  just found it and removed it
[12:23:30] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  i do agree that its a mess and needs a LOT of cleaning. It was my first attempt at a heavy jquery site and it failed. but it was working just fine and the back end actually works really well for the client. I just can NOT figure out why this plugin is causing such issues
[12:24:48] <djQuery> LindsayMac, my mistake
[12:25:25] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  any thoughts as to the cause of such a conflict? It literally onlyhappens with this woocommerce plugin active
[12:25:55] <LindsayMac> AND why its only happening in Chrome with no errors to help debug
[12:27:34] <tgodar> anyone had issues with datetimepicket reverting to 'today' when no value selected even though current selection is not 'today'?
[12:31:55] <djQuery> tgodar, ?demo
[12:32:06] <NoiseEee> i'm not sure LindsayMac.
[12:32:08] <djQuery> ?demo
[12:32:08] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:32:27] <tgodar> djQuery: ill try and recreate if I can't figure it out.  Thanks
[12:32:28] <LindsayMac> ahhhh this is going to drive me insane!
[12:33:10] <djQuery> LindsayMac, make a very simple demo then add the componenets one at a time
[12:33:36] <djQuery> LindsayMac, slapp it up on jsbin.com or something
[12:34:02] <LindsayMac> djQuery:  that is impossible because this is a wordpress install with plugins and a LOT of other stuff. I can debug right here, I just don't know where to look
[12:34:33] <LindsayMac> i've already tested ALL of the JS code and everything is triggering EXCEPT for the scroll function on the menu links and a scrollbar plugin for overflow of div containers
[12:35:21] <djQuery> does the plugin that you are using have a support forum?
[12:35:31] <iman> if(result.status == 0)  it means equal and what if three are there three equals if(result.status === 0) ?
[12:35:37] <LindsayMac> djQuery:  i've also disabled every plugin systematically and pinpointed it directly to this one specific area with this one specific aspect of the javascript in ONE use case (which is Chrome)
[12:36:07] <djQuery> you say that it stops working when you add a certain plugin check thier support site
[12:36:16] <LindsayMac> djQuery:  well there is the wordpress forum and the #wordpress IRC which I have already posted on, but I was pretty certain this is more of a javascript issue regarding MY code and not the plugin
[12:37:14] <LindsayMac> djQuery:  i told you. It conflicting with smething in a specific plugin and I have pinpointed it to this one specific plugin, but the plugin itself works therefore it is my code conflicting with their js.. I am pretty certain is it my code because I am relatively new and am still making mistakes.
[12:37:34] <LindsayMac> the chances of the plugin devs supporting this issue is sllim because its a JS / jquery issue and not a plugin issue
[12:38:16] <NoiseEee> and where is "your" script?
[12:38:46] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  the "scrollme" is the script that controlls the smooth scrolling area and custominit is mine as well
[12:39:01] <LindsayMac> the stuff in custominiti seems to be working fine. The tabbed content on the team page works, etc
[12:39:50] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  i thought maybe it was an order of operations type of issue where some scripts were being called in the wrong order.
[12:40:46] <NoiseEee> LindsayMac: well you might be reduced to throwing in some "debugger" statements or console.log in scrollme.js where things should be happening.  goooooood luck.
[12:41:05] <NoiseEee> LindsayMac: not sure if you've been over http://fixingthesejquery.com/ but its always worth a peak
[12:41:06] <NoiseEee> peek
[12:41:55] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  i've done some of that but I dont know that I know enough abotu what I am doing to make this happen
[12:42:24] <NoiseEee> trial by fire LindsayMac, you will soon know :P
[12:42:40] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  trial by SUICIDE in this case.. ah
[12:42:47] <LindsayMac> working with data is SOO much easiler
[12:42:51] <LindsayMac> easier*
[12:44:04] <NoiseEee> offhand my guess is that the events aren't even being detected at all by Chrome, ie: the wrong element is being observed.  so i'd start there.  see if the 'click' event is even being registered / function being called.
[12:44:36] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  ok.. So i would use a log event after the code that initializes the script for those top links?
[12:45:50] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  you know what else is strange.. in the scrollme.js i have some math scripts that calculate the pixel distance from the top of a container to the edge of the screen,.. Even THAT is working!
[12:46:26] <NoiseEee> LindsayMac: like on line 40?
[12:46:38] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  yea
[12:47:26] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  ok i put a breakpoint after the initialization for the links.. Its registering when I click!
[12:47:46] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  so its acutally seeing my clicking on the menu item as somethjing it's supposed to initialize. thats good news
[12:48:02] <NoiseEee> well carry on
[12:48:21] <NoiseEee> i mean now that you're in the debugger you can follow how the code is being interpreted, what its firing next / what its skipping over
[12:48:26] <NoiseEee> so hopefully you're on the right track
[12:48:29] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  well that means that the actual animation of the content in the window isn't happening. I dont know what to do about tha t
[12:49:32] <NoiseEee> LindsayMac: use the step-over / step-into buttons to see the rest of the execution
[12:49:37] <NoiseEee> that should lead you somewhere
[12:49:42] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  so I dropped the debugger down one line UNDER the "scrollTo" line and its making it there as well..
[12:50:09] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  i dont know what step over or step into buttons are
[12:50:12] <LindsayMac> but i'm looking
[12:51:09] <NoiseEee> LindsayMac: when your debugger is active, you can follow the code through the rest of the functions/methods etc
[12:51:36] <NoiseEee> LindsayMac:  http://fixingthesejquery.com/ has more tips about how to use the debugger effectively and goes over those things
[12:52:26] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide11 / http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide14
[12:52:30] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  ok yea sorry. I got ahead of myself
[13:02:23] <Fenikkusu> Could I please get some opinions on this code? Primarily from a structure and best-practices point of view. http://jsfiddle.net/8dgpq/2/
[13:04:45] <LindsayMac> Ok i'm getting closer NoiseEee
[13:05:11] <LindsayMac> now if I remove the "return false" line of code it will scroll down to the container's proper location but it still will not animate it
[13:09:02] <xec_> Fenikkusu: is this for some sort of game?
[13:09:44] <Fenikkusu> xec_, It's for a game, but not part of a game. Its the primary calculation for the stats of items in the game.
[13:10:28] <Fenikkusu> I'm making a helper WebApp, and want to be sure I'm following jQuery Practices as best I can. Just so much stuff I'm not sure where to go or what to believe.
[13:11:50] <xec_> Fenikkusu: hard to say what you could improve without understanding the purpose and flow, really. also looks like the indentation is a bit messy, perhaps from copypaste
[13:13:43] <xec_> the if undefined parts look a bit odd to me though, syntax wise i would probably do something like: $.fn.tf = $.fn.tf || {};
[13:14:17] <Fenikkusu> Well I c/p from notepadd++, using tabs as indent, so that may be the issue there. From a purpose standpoint, I will be a jQuery UI type web interface, that upon certain calls will call this method to get the results, as multiple sections of the UI will use the one function, and each section is it's own entity.
[13:16:31] <djQuery> wasnt there something in the newest ui.dialog about putting the dialog in a container?
[13:16:49] <djQuery> instead of just attaching it to document.body?
[13:17:08] <pamere> this is a weird one for me http://pastebin.com/M8vKfjQC If I just select files using the file selector and submit my page i can normally see the file array using a print_r in php ...However after clicking the button and the on click is fired there are there are no files coming to php anymore.
[13:17:11] <pamere> $(":button").on('click', function () seems to be the offending function but for the life of me I cant figure out why when a button is clicked and some manipulation takes place it will cause the files not to be passed through.any help will be much appreciated
[13:18:07] <kripster> could someone tell me how to move my label down so it is centered(vertically) to my textfield, thx http://jsfiddle.net/pnS87/35/
[13:20:54] <djQuery> kripster, figure the width of label, figure the width of the input,   margin = (inputWidth - labelWidth) /2
[13:21:38] <xec_> width?
[13:21:53] <xec_> wouldn't that do horizontal centering? :p
[13:22:18] <djQuery> xec_, well height instead of width
[13:22:50] <xec_> ok, but the input is inside of the label
[13:23:08] <xec_> have you looked at the code?
[13:23:25] <kripster> I'm confused lol
[13:23:31] <djQuery> by the way in chrome it allready looks that way
[13:23:36] <Fenikkusu> xec_, Wouldn't the overhead of reassigning using $.fn.tf = $.fn.tf be greater than just checking if it's defined?
[13:24:01] <kripster> I'm using chrome
[13:24:18] <kripster> if i use vertical-align?
[13:24:20] <xec_> Fenikkusu: it's just a reference, not a copy, so i doubt it
[13:24:41] <Fenikkusu> True...
[13:24:57] <djQuery> kripster, if you are trying to center it side to side just set the text to centered
[13:25:31] <djQuery> never mind I was looking at it wrong
[13:25:54] <kripster> djquery: nope doesn't make any difference
[13:26:56] <Fenikkusu> xec_, Thank you for your input. Would you say that if you define the context as being as I explained earlier, is this the proper syntax, or is there a better syntax, etc?
[13:26:59] <djQuery> kripster http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1554941/vertical-align-text-in-a-label
[13:27:13] <iman> do tou use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/CSS_Reference as CSS reference s?
[13:28:41] <LindsayMac> Holy cow I am REALLY REALLY stumped now. Just for the heck of it I de-registered all of the scripts loaded with the wordpress WooCommerce plugin and my javascript STILL wasn't working.. yet as soon as I deactivate the plugin, it works
[13:30:12] <LindsayMac> I really honestly have no idea now why this plugin isn't allowing my code to work
[13:30:14] <djQuery> kripster, hmph that didnt work either http://jsfiddle.net/pnS87/45/
[13:30:56] <kripster> i know i just tried it, lol, i thought this would be something simple
[13:31:41] <xec_> Fenikkusu: i can't really say. but another tip is to create a console object with a dummy log (and error and dir) method instead of checking for it before the call
[13:32:44] <xec_> Fenikkusu: you could do: window.console = window.console || { log: function(){} }; // stop IE from choking
[13:32:57] <kripster> does anyone know how to use vertical align properely for a label
[13:33:56] <xec_> kripster: not with a float like that, but css tables works: http://jsfiddle.net/pnS87/50/
[13:35:35] <xec_> kripster: or you could set the line-height of the label equal to the height of the input
[13:35:50] <Fenikkusu> xec_, Okay, thank you. I like the idea of doing the console object, but it does make it so it is more difficult for me to disable/enable on the fly. I prefer the method I have as it allows me to specify a debug (Not in the code you see), and thus control if any data is put out at all.
[13:35:53] <djQuery> xec_, ++
[13:35:54] <kripster> <xec_>: legend, thx
[13:37:04] <djQuery> xec_, kripster,   by the way this also works if you don't like   display: table
[13:37:05] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/pnS87/59/
[13:37:46] <xec_> djQuery: thats true, but the same issue, won't work with floats unfortunately :/
[13:39:09] <xec_> Fenikkusu: whatever floats your boat :) i'd say stick to whatever style works and you're comfortable with
[13:39:38] <xec_> unless you're part of a bigger team which enforces style ;)
[13:39:53] <dwarder> can anyone help me with removing a class http://jsfiddle.net/9LULP/
[13:40:47] <xec_> dwarder: http://jsfiddle.net/9LULP/1/ :P
[13:41:52] <dwarder> xec_: where have i mistaken, strange but this class seem to be already removed upon loading
[13:42:02] <dwarder> in your cod
[13:42:03] <dwarder> e
[13:42:26] <xec_> dwarder: yeah i just removed the call to .each() and called the function you wrote
[13:42:48] <Fenikkusu> xec_, Well I'm doing this for personal items, but trying to increase my knowledge for team sake. I just can't seem to find a widely selected method of building items. IE: Plugin Vs Widget, If Multiple Elements Do This, If One Instance, Do That, Etc.
[13:42:58] <xec_> dwarder: if it's clearer: http://jsfiddle.net/9LULP/2/
[13:43:42] * dwarder wonders why the button doesn't work
[13:43:48] <xec_> Fenikkusu: this is a good read if you haven't already: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[13:44:41] <dwarder> xec_: thanks
[13:44:58] <iman> do you know how can I change dialog's header direction?
[13:47:42] <Fenikkusu> xec_, Yes I've read through it before, Thank you. My big thing at this point is I've seen a good number of various patterns, IE: https://github.com/zenorocha/jquery-plugin-patterns, (who actually posted something earlier), but I can't seem to understand when each is best applied. Guess more digging is at hand, lol. Maybe I was to brain dead at the time.
[13:48:07] <woah> Hey, how do I get the jquery object an each() loop was run on from inside the loop?
[13:48:56] <Fenikkusu> And of course now I found something in the read me...go figure...
[13:49:01] <woah> right now i can only get each individual element in the set
[13:49:09] <woah> it's for this: http://jsfiddle.net/hu3dv/1/
[13:49:40] <woah> right now i have $(this).parent().css("width", "30%");
[13:49:44] <woah> setting the width
[13:50:11] <woah> i would like to replace it with a function that uses .length to get the appropriate percentage
[13:50:37] <woah> so i'd like to get $(".nav-tabs li a") from inside the each
[13:50:52] <woah> *expression not function
[13:53:40] <f0ster> so I am using $.ajax to post a form, am I getting a 500 response from the server but my error: function() my ajax declaration is never being called.. shouldn't a 500 response trigger my error fn ?
[13:53:59] <vrlogrs> hey guys
[13:54:05] <vrlogrs> need some drag-drop help again ..
[13:54:30] <vrlogrs> is there any way i can revert a dragged image from within the drop function?
[13:55:31] <vrlogrs> i cant get the accept function working and its peeing me off
[13:56:01] <vrlogrs> so, if there's any way i can revert a dragged element from within the drop function, it would be awesome
[13:57:50] <Es0teric> you can pass a class or id into .has() correct?
[13:59:06] <vrlogrs> im not sure what you mean :S
[13:59:39] <vrlogrs> i need to be able to check the dragged element within the dropped function and then decide if i want to drop it there, or revert it back
[13:59:50] <LindsayMac> I FIGURED IT OUT!
[14:00:01] <LindsayMac> i hate this site
[14:00:27] <LindsayMac> now, again, the scroller bar script isnt working, but I can work that out
[14:00:59] <Es0teric> LindsayMac didnt you used to be in the wordpress channel? o.O
[14:01:12] <LindsayMac> I can be in many channels Es0teric
[14:01:31] <Es0teric> well i wasnt saying that like... its a bad thing -- i just recall seeing you there LindsayMac
[14:01:44] <LindsayMac> yea but i didnt USED to be there. in fact, i am there right now
[14:01:52] <Es0teric> oh
[14:01:59] <Es0teric> i havent used wordpress since 3.3
[14:02:08] <Es0teric> so i havent been in there... for awhile
[14:02:42] <Es0teric> oh nvm, textual logged me in automatically in there
[14:02:42] <Es0teric> >.>
[14:06:22] <vrlogrs> any ideas guys? :S
[14:12:28] <iman> how can i get text between <button></button>, i used $(this).val but it doesn't work correctly
[14:12:37] <NoiseEee> iman: html
[14:12:39] <NoiseEee> or text
[14:12:54] <iman> thank you dear NoiseEee
[14:15:43] <Fenikkusu> xec_, when you mentioned the $.fn.tf = $.fn.tf || {}, what syntax operation call is the '||'. I've seen '|' before, but normally '||' is a straight or for boolean style comparisons...
[14:20:36] <gnarf> Fenikkusu: its "OR"
[14:20:40] <tds5016> hit here. I was wondering if someone could help me wout with a helper.....
[14:20:49] <gnarf> Fenikkusu: a || b returns a if it is truthy, b otherwise
[14:20:54] <tds5016> when I have a helper on draggable, and I use clone, the helper ends up being huge.
[14:21:05] <tds5016> is there a way to change the size without using a custom helper?
[14:21:18] <Fenikkusu> ...okay I feel stupid...
[14:21:22] <gnarf> Fenikkusu: the practice of var something = value || defaultValue; is generally called an "opti"
[14:21:24] <Fenikkusu> I should of known that
[14:22:26] <Fenikkusu> gnarf, Thank you
[14:22:28] <vrlogrs> anyone have any ideas for the drag-drop issue? :(
[14:24:35] <tds5016> vrlogrs: was that in reference to my question or a different one?
[14:25:14] <vrlogrs> different
[14:26:42] <rmill> var thing = thigy || otherThingy || orMaybeThisThingy || thisTimeForshure;
[14:27:21] <rmill> /s/thig/thing
[14:27:40] <Salt> so I'm trying to read the width of an element that is position fixed and 100%, but .width() and .css('width') both return 100 and 100px, any ideas on how to get the real width?
[14:29:02] <Salt> I suppose I can just use $(window).width() but that isn't really semantically related
[14:30:40] <vrlogrs> if you guys dont know .. could some1 please advise which channel could help me out please?
[14:30:52] <Es0teric> i am trying to check if theres a class in multiple img's... doing $('img').each(function() { console.log($(this)); is just returning an object but not multiple objects of the img elements });
[14:31:29] <Es0teric> ** $('img').each(function() { console.log($(this)); });  is just returning an object but not multiple objects of the img elements
[14:32:04] <Fenikkusu> Es0teric, .each is an iterator.
[14:32:20] <Es0teric> Fenikkusu yes i know.. i was trying to iterate through each <img>
[14:32:29] <Es0teric> because i thought thats the best way to do it...
[14:32:37] <FernandoBasso> I need to those visible .sub_menu elements to an array. But it adds almost always the same thing many times, and not the others. http://jsfiddle.net/2MHbt/7/
[14:32:46] <Fenikkusu> If that's what you are doing then yes, I believe that is the best way.
[14:33:08] <Fenikkusu> vrlogrs, Huh?
[14:33:22] <FernandoBasso> s/I need to/I need to add/
[14:33:32] <Salt> eh, that fix works, so I spose I'll use it
[14:34:11] <vrlogrs> Fenikkusu: yah?
[14:34:31] <Fenikkusu> vrlogrs, I'm not sure what you are asking.
[14:34:39] <vrlogrs> oh ..
[14:34:43] <vrlogrs> let me try again
[14:34:58] <vrlogrs> i am dragging an item onto a droppable element ..
[14:35:16] <vrlogrs> in teh drop function, i want to check if i want to allow the drop or revert the element back to where it was
[14:35:21] <vrlogrs> how can i do that?
[14:35:35] <Nece228> is this logically correct?:
[14:35:36] <Nece228> alert($(this).parent().parent().attr('src'));
[14:36:34] <Fenikkusu> FernandoBasso, is it possible that your issue is that you are running .push to push the collection of ids, rather than each individual id? You might try .filter(':visible').each(function(){nav_elems.push($(this).attr('id'))} instead, but I'm not completely sure.
[14:36:49] <Fenikkusu> vrlogrs, Sec
[14:36:58] <FernandoBasso> Fenikkusu: Thanks. I'll try.
[14:39:16] <FernandoBasso> Fenikkusu: Works. Now, I'll just code something to prevent adding ids that are already in the array. Thanks a bunch.
[14:39:16] <pyramid_aliens> why cant i select the image with closest()? http://jsfiddle.net/qvKAM/1/
[14:39:23] <Whirl3d> anybody know how to stop a fiddle that has gone mad and just keeps pushing range errors?
[14:41:55] <Fenikkusu> vrlogrs, without studying the code more, my guess is that you need to use start event to mark where the item was, then on stop event reset the position if in the wrong location. I've never personally worked with draggable, so I'm not quite sure if that is the best way or not.
[14:42:16] <Fenikkusu> Whirl3d, Close the window?
[14:43:06] <vrlogrs> thanks for taking the time Fenikkusu
[14:43:17] <vrlogrs> ive managed to come up with a simple hack that will suffice for now ..
[14:43:31] <vrlogrs> ill try it again when im a little less frustrated :)
[14:43:33] <vrlogrs> thanks
[14:43:49] <Fenikkusu> pyramid_aliens, Not sure, but it could be that you are using '[img]' instead of 'img', as I would think it would be.
[14:44:27] <pyramid_aliens> Fenikkusu, i think i already tried that
[14:44:36] <Fenikkusu> k, sec
[14:44:37] <pyramid_aliens> trying again...
[14:45:29] <pyramid_aliens> yep, doesnt work
[14:48:18] <Fenikkusu> pyramid_aliens, If I'm reading the docs correctly, then .closest will only return the closest of the parent hiearchy. Since your IMG is off the path of the parents path, it's not finding it.
[14:48:48] <pyramid_aliens> oooh
[14:50:40] <Fenikkusu> pyramid_aliens, Yes, doing  var parent = $(this).closest('.product-list'); Works.
[14:51:37] <Fenikkusu> So in theory you could do $(this).closest('.product-list').find('div.product-image > img'); or similar
[14:52:05] <CapMax> hi
[14:52:16] <CapMax> if jquery is loaded in no conflicts mode, how can i make named functions with it
[14:52:19] <CapMax> it
[14:52:20] <ewaibel> hi, i'm trying to use the jquery UI dialog and the 'appendTo' option, has anyone used this option before?
[14:52:32] <CapMax> jQuery(document).ready(function($){ etc
[14:52:34] <TelFiRE> woot for 1.9 and 2.0 :D
[14:52:37] <CapMax> how do i give that function a name
[14:53:06] <TelFiRE> So, if I just include 1.9 for ie8 and prior, most everything will work between the two but have better performance wherever 2.0 is supported?
[14:54:38] <Fenikkusu> CapMax, you may find it easier to sandbox jquery within an annomous function. (function($) { //..do stuff here...})(jQuery); Then $ always refers to jQuery and you don't need to do no-conflict.
[14:54:49] <pyramid_aliens> Fenikkusu, it worked :)
[14:54:58] <CapMax> Fenikkusu: im using it in wordpress, needs to be no conflicts
[14:55:32] <Fenikkusu> CapMax, when you sandbox it, scope comes into play. jQuery is locally scoped as $ specifically.
[14:56:01] <CapMax> i dont want to make any such modifications Fenikkusu, i just want an answer to my Q
[14:56:54] <pyramid_aliens> Fenikkusu, is there an opposite function to closest()? one that goes down instead of up the dom?
[14:58:16] <Fenikkusu> pyramid_aliens, the closest will probably be .next(), but it's near impossible to go specifically down when there are in theory innumerable possibilities, so if you need to go down, it'd be more efficent to specify what you want and use .find instead.
[14:58:44] <CapMax> nvm figured it out
[14:59:10] <Fenikkusu> .children iterates the immediate children, .find iterates all items underneath.
[15:00:33] <Fenikkusu> Unless of course I'm wrong and someone else is better familiar with js than I am. I'm more of a tinkerer that anything lol
[15:03:17] <pyramid_aliens> well i have to hit a button and then select elements next to the button. next() sounds like what Im looking for
[15:04:57] <Agamemnus> Hello.... how do you remove an element from a fancybox slideshow?
[15:05:07] <Agamemnus> Do you have to close the current fancybox and re-init?
[15:15:37] <Whirl3d> is the focus event triggered with the tab key?
[15:21:11] <tds5016> anyone use jquery touch punch?
[15:21:29] <tds5016> and if you do, has anyone founda  fix for the helpers showing up at the corner of the screne?
[15:27:01] <zoned> can i animate scrollLeft?
[15:27:20] <zoned> $('body').animate( { scrollLeft: 0 }, 1000 );    didn't do anything
[15:28:26] <xdjuj_> scroll left is not a CSS option
[15:28:44] <xdjuj_> You can animate CSS attribute
[15:29:22] <xdjuj_> You don't need to animte scroll, you already have a plugin to do that :
[15:29:23] <xdjuj_> http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[15:29:31] <xdjuj_> http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/
[15:29:36] <mehwork> is it bad practice to do $("#blah") instead of $(container, "#blah") ?
[15:29:40] <Ziber> So, I'm bored and writing a simple JQuery animation, but I guess I made some simple mistake. http://sandbox.jkode.us/miscJS/ - javascript console says "$ is undefined".
[15:31:11] <beancurd> Ziber: did you include jquery?
[15:31:30] <xdjuj_> beancurd as you can see by reading the source, yes :p
[15:31:31] <beancurd> before your script that is
[15:31:41] <beancurd> nah, haven't clicked it.
[15:31:42] <xdjuj_> Ziber the console is not saying anything but
[15:31:45] <Ziber> beancurd: Yeah. I have a local copy of it.
[15:32:00] <xdjuj_> You try to animate a property not defined on your span
[15:32:07] <xdjuj_> And a span is "inline"
[15:32:21] <xdjuj_> You should try on a block
[15:32:22] <Ziber> Hm?
[15:32:30] <beancurd> xdjuj_: 'did you include jquery' is like our version of "have you tried turning it off and on again?"
[15:33:55] <Ziber> So, ways to fix it?
[15:33:59] <xdjuj_> Ziber
[15:34:24] <Ziber> ?
[15:34:33] <xdjuj_> CSS > #daspan{display:block;position:absolute;right:0;top:0;}
[15:37:42] <Ziber> Uh huh, doesn't fix it. Actually makes the text disappear.
[15:38:20] <EyePulp> anyone have experience with requireJS and have opinions on it's downsides?
[15:38:39] <EyePulp> I like it, so I'm trying to figure out reasons to steer clear. =)
[15:41:25] <Ziber> Anyone? :/
[15:43:08] <Caelum> so the source map in .min.js breaks on IE if you include it twice
[15:43:24] <Caelum> now I need to fix our fucking templates so that we don't do that
[15:43:29] <xdjuj_> Ziber ==> http://jsfiddle.net/89p64/
[15:43:44] <Caelum> last night I just changed it to include the .js instead as a quick fix
[15:46:27] <Caelum> it would be so nice if .js files could just have some way to detect being loaded twice
[15:46:38] <xdjuj_> Ziber to be easier to read and understand => http://jsfiddle.net/89p64/1/
[15:47:06] <xdjuj_> Caelum that's not the JS that need that but the JS
[15:47:20] <xdjuj_> You should test before launching an effect maybe
[15:47:21] <xdjuj_> Like
[15:47:28] <Caelum> xdjuj_: hmm?
[15:47:46] <mehwork> is it bad practice to do $("#blah") instead of $(container, "#blah") or $(container).find('#blah') ?
[15:48:02] <Caelum> mehwork: you can only have one id on a page
[15:48:08] <Caelum> mehwork: so wtf does it matter?
[15:48:12] <xdjuj_> if( jQuery(".my_class").length ){ init_my_function = my_function(); }
[15:48:29] <xdjuj_> So Caelum if you don't have .my_class your function won't be load
[15:48:47] <Caelum> xdjuj_: I'm talking about jquery.min.js itself
[15:48:56] <xdjuj_> You can test it
[15:49:39] <mehwork> Caelum: i'm reading an article that says it's easier to test backbone apps that do that anyway
[15:49:58] <Caelum> what is backbone?
[15:50:17] <xdjuj_> Caelum =>
[15:50:18] <xdjuj_> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.21/jquery-ui.min.js"></script> <!-- ecriture direct d'appel à jquery -->
[15:50:18] <xdjuj_> <script type="text/javascript">!window.jQuery && document.write('<script src="theme/js/jquery-ui-1.8.22.custom.min.js"><\/script>')</script> <!-- fallback local si google HS -->
[15:50:31] <sonotos> hm when is ajax.success triggert? docu says "when the Ajax request completes successfully", but what's sucessfully? seems it even got triggert when i send statuscode 405
[15:50:46] <mehwork> Caelum: if you don't even know that you're not qualified to answer :p no offense
[15:51:01] <xdjuj_> Or for jQuery Caelum =>
[15:51:01] <xdjuj_> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-1.7.1.min.js"></script> <!-- ecriture direct d'appel à jquery -->
[15:51:01] <xdjuj_> <script type="text/javascript">!window.jQuery && document.write('<script src="theme/js/jquery-1.7.1.min.js"><\/script>')</script> <!-- fallback local si google HS -->
[15:51:36] <xdjuj_> sonotos success is when there's a connexion "ok"
[15:51:54] <xdjuj_> error is when no transaction like a 404
[15:52:43] <xdjuj_> mehwork FIND can't be better than #blah
[15:52:48] <sonotos> hm my success event got triggert with a 400 statuscode, so that should not be right?
[15:53:11] <Caelum> mehwork: I actually know jquery pretty well, so go fuck yourself, no offense
[15:53:36] <Caelum> xdjuj_: beautiful, thank you very much
[15:54:13] <Caelum> xdjuj_: this will save me from stupid template variable hacks
[15:54:20] <xdjuj_> Caelum another trick is to add a "hasJS" class on the body on you first call to jQuery
[15:54:31] <xdjuj_> jQuery("body").addClass("hasJS");
[15:54:54] <xdjuj_> So, you can FROM YOUR CSS apply style for jQUery purpose
[15:55:28] <xdjuj_> For example, not doing jQuery(".something").hide(); but in CSS => .hasJS .something{display:none;}
[15:55:49] <xdjuj_> If jQuery is not load, you won't have the .hasJS class, so the .something won't hide
[15:55:50] <sonotos> xdjuj_: ok my fault thx
[15:56:11] <xdjuj_> sonotos great :)
[15:57:41] <s0x> hey guys, can anyone give me a hint how to replace live() by on() ... on() is not working for new elements created some time in future :(
[15:58:08] <EyePulp> s0x: what's your code look like?
[15:58:17] <EyePulp> and your html if possible
[15:58:18] <Cronoh> it should work fine as lone as the element using .on() is a parent of the elements inserted later
[15:58:53] <xdjuj_> It works if you're not testing the presence of the element before
[15:59:47] <s0x> i used to use $("a.page-request").live("click", function(ev) {}), i've just replaced "live" by "on"
[16:00:28] <Cronoh> nah that wont work
[16:00:37] <EyePulp> s0x: is a.page-request getting created dynamically?
[16:01:26] <Cronoh> $('parent.of.a.page-request').on('click', 'a.page-request', function(e)) {});
[16:02:04] <EyePulp> s0x: pick a higher level container that a.page-request elements are getting put into.  $(document).on('click',"a.page-request", function(evt){});
[16:02:09] <EyePulp> doh -- too slow
[16:02:13] <s0x> ohh sweet :)
[16:02:25] <s0x> thx mate, thats the one :D
[16:03:00] <EyePulp> s0x: for efficiency, point to the container just above the place things are getting created.  don'
[16:03:08] <EyePulp> t point to $(document)
[16:03:35] <bambu> Hi
[16:03:36] <s0x> i see :)
[16:03:59] <EyePulp> takes less resources to watch a narrower part of the DOM, I suspect.
[16:04:07] <bambu> If I wanted to slide a div from the bottom left, to top right of the screen how would I do so?
[16:04:13] <Cronoh> events don't have to bubble up as far
[16:04:35] <EyePulp> Cronoh: so faster response?
[16:04:45] <Cronoh> yes better performance
[16:04:52] <EyePulp> interesting
[16:05:25] <Cronoh> bambu, animate?
[16:05:36] <EyePulp> I suppose that's more efficient than polling the selected dom area and asking "what's new?"
[16:05:38] <EyePulp> =)
[16:05:43] <bambu> Sure, not sure how I'd use it though.
[16:06:01] <EyePulp> bambu: google for jquery + .animate()
[16:06:02] <Cronoh> yes event based programming is much less resources needed
[16:06:22] <bambu> EyePulp: I understand, I'm looking at the docs right now
[16:06:43] <EyePulp> bambu: excellent.  what's your code look like?
[16:06:51] <bambu> ;)
[16:07:01] <bambu> I'm not sure the math to move it diagonally
[16:07:04] <bambu> Let me see here
[16:07:23] <Cronoh> use animate and change the location of the div using top/left etc
[16:07:43] <EyePulp> bambu: If memory serves you would simply give it src & destinations for top/left, and it would interpolate the path.
[16:07:59] <bambu> Not sure what the last part means
[16:08:01] <Whirl3d> Could someone explain what is happening here? If I have the text selected using select(), I am unable to tab to the next field. If I don't and tab to the next field, it doesn't select. Any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/hA4we/4/
[16:08:02] <bambu> I have code now.
[16:08:02] * EyePulp is too slow for this
[16:08:24] <Cronoh> my responses very casual ;P
[16:08:45] <bambu> I also was looking at, I did it in Vanilla JS, a way to go through all of the a:href's (getelementsbytagname) and listen for events on each oen :)
[16:09:39] <Whirl3d> bambu, use delegation for them so you only have to write one controller, not one for each
[16:13:21] <bambu> Whirl3d: Thanks, look into it
[16:14:07] <devslash> ive got a jquery related problem in my greasemonkey script. I have an element on a page named TimecardDetail. If I do alert(document.getElementById('TimecardDetail').rows.length)  it displays 32 which is correct. when I do alert($('TimecardDetail').attr('rows').length) it says that the object is not defined
[16:15:03] <Whirl3d> there is no html element "TimecardDetail"
[16:15:08] <devslash> there is
[16:15:21] <Whirl3d> Maybe #TimecardDetail or .TimecardDetail
[16:15:23] <devslash> oops i put a # in front of it
[16:15:27] <devslash> i tried all 3
[16:15:35] <devslash> i mean i forgot to type it here
[16:15:54] <devslash> im testing my GM script in Chrome and Firefox
[16:15:55] <Whirl3d> Attr.('rows") will give you a number
[16:15:59] <Whirl3d> not an array
[16:16:09] <freemind> hello mates, i'm loading some content in a <div> with jQuery load(), afterwards i fill some text() inside this div, but its disappearing instantly.. do i need to use callback function from load() to edit this loaded content?
[16:16:14] <Whirl3d> it will tell you the number of rows you have
[16:16:21] <devslash> shouldnt that be .attr('rows')
[16:16:29] <Whirl3d> and actually, just the number of rows the element as created with.
[16:16:45] <Whirl3d> devslash, thx.  LOL sorry
[16:16:59] <devslash> its returning undefined
[16:17:35] <Whirl3d> probably because you didn't define it. Which is normal. YOu want $("#TImecardDetail tr").length
[16:17:51] <devslash> i didnt define it
[16:18:11] <devslash> its an existing element on the page (not my site) that im trying to modify using GM
[16:18:21] <Whirl3d> right, when you setup your table, if it didn't have a "rows='  attr you won't get one
[16:18:27] <miskander> Hello, I am having a hard time with getting Jquery 1.9 and slideToggle to animate in FF
[16:18:33] <devslash> so what do i do ?
[16:18:41] <miskander> I reverted back to Jquery 1.4 and it magically works with that version, any advice?
[16:18:41] <Whirl3d> Just what I said!
[16:18:49] <Whirl3d> Select the rows and get the length of the selection
[16:19:08] <devslash> undefined
[16:19:10] <Whirl3d> $("#TimecardDetail tr").length
[16:19:24] <devslash> yup
[16:19:26] <Whirl3d> Then either TimecardDetail is not defined or defined more than once
[16:19:30] <coldhead> miskander: do you NEED 1.9?
[16:19:31] <Whirl3d> or it's not a table
[16:19:43] <Whirl3d> Undefined?
[16:19:52] <miskander> Would rather have the latest, any reason I would want to stay on 1.4?
[16:20:03] <coldhead> miskander: because it works for you :)
[16:20:16] <devslash> Whirl3d its defined like this: <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%" id="TimecardDetail" class="BorderLeftAlign">
[16:20:25] <Whirl3d> devslash, it shouldn't return undefined because even a selection with no results doesn't return undefined.
[16:20:27] <miskander> Yea, but then I will have to deal with missing APIs
[16:20:51] <miskander> Would rather get down to why 1.9 doesn't animate slideToggle
[16:21:35] <Whirl3d> $(".thereaintnoclass").length   will not return undefined, for example. You must have another error somewhere
[16:21:42] <miskander> It works on the query site just fine in my browser
[16:21:49] <miskander> so I have to be doing something wrong
[16:21:50] <devslash> no
[16:22:00] <devslash> its the way im referring to it that fucked
[16:22:03] <sahbeewah> oh cool when did 1.9 get released
[16:22:12] <Whirl3d> careful with the language, they'll kick ya
[16:22:17] <devslash> oh ok
[16:22:51] <Whirl3d> $("#TimecardDetail") will give you a jquery object with one table element in it.
[16:23:07] <coldhead> miskander: got a demo we can see?
[16:23:15] <coldhead> also miskander, does it work with 1.8 ?
[16:23:24] <devslash> ok
[16:23:25] <miskander> Nope, I just tried 1.8
[16:23:27] <miskander> working on demo
[16:23:32] <coldhead> thanks babe
[16:23:34] <Whirl3d> $("#TimecardDetail").find("tr") will give you a jquery object (kinda like an array) with the number of rows in it
[16:23:40] <devslash> alert($("#TImecardDetail")) returns an object in both chrome and firefox
[16:23:48] <Whirl3d> Which it should
[16:24:29] <Whirl3d> A complicated object because Jquery is wrapped around it . that's what $(selector) does. It wraps jQuery's creamy goodness around the object being selected
[16:24:43] <miskander> Code:
[16:24:44] <devslash> $("#TimecardDetail").find("tr") returns an object
[16:24:58] <Whirl3d> Which it should. That's an array-like jquery object again
[16:25:03] <star_prone> how can I uncheck a selected input type radio?
[16:25:05] <Whirl3d> that's what the $() does
[16:25:25] <miskander> https://gist.github.com/7279b5823de5fa3fcdfc
[16:25:36] <Whirl3d> alert ($("#TimecardDetail tr").length); should give you a number
[16:25:59] <devslash> ye i just figured that out
[16:26:04] <devslash> thanks
[16:26:07] <Whirl3d> np
[16:26:12] <miskander> Cant find a good place to host a demo coldhead

[16:35:37] <coldhead> miskander: i am seeing the same behaviour in fx and chrome, what's not working?
[16:35:51] <miskander> coldhead: no animatings
[16:35:56] <miskander> *animations
[16:36:15] <Whirl3d> $("#elem").animate({top:0, left:$(window).width()-$(#elem).width()}, 3000);
[16:36:37] <Whirl3d> forgot the second set of quotes, but you get the idea.
[16:37:22] <Whirl3d> pass the coordinates that you want to animate to as the first parameter in your animate call.
[16:38:22] <miskander> coldhead: are you seeing it animate in FF and Chrome?
[16:38:39] <bambu> I hear this from Jquery site "but we recommend that you use .on() for any new jQuery project"  So use .on() vs .delegate()   both work but on() is preferred i guess ...
[16:39:13] <Whirl3d> I was talking in general terms, not the delegate method.
[16:39:14] <Whirl3d> Sorry
[16:39:40] <coldhead> hmm
[16:39:44] <coldhead> no, no animation in either
[16:39:54] <coldhead> just trying to establish how browser dependent it was
[16:40:02] <coldhead> animating <tr>s is generally hard
[16:40:14] <coldhead> better to animate content within <tr>s
[16:40:22] <coldhead> having said that i am still struggling to make it work
[16:40:24] <Melsom> Hi, when I type in input-field "slider_h1", it should update html in div with class "title". How do I accomplish that with jquery? http://jsfiddle.net/c3n7k/1/
[16:40:36] <Melsom> Prev, next, parent, siblings.. driving me totally nuts :p
[16:40:38] <bambu> Whirl3d: I just read wayy too much, I suppose. I also take things too literally :p
[16:40:48] <bambu> http://pastie.org/5712438 Anyone have a comment on this?
[16:41:35] <Whirl3d> funny...we said to animate the top left and you animated the bottom right
[16:41:43] <miskander> coldhead: ok, I didn't realize animating TD was harder than another element
[16:42:06] <bambu> Whirl3d: Did you? I don't log, so no scroll back.
[16:42:15] <Whirl3d> by default, position is determined by top left, so it's best to animate by top left, imo.
[16:42:52] <Melsom> Anyone?
[16:42:54] <Melsom> :)
[16:42:54] <coldhead> miskander: yes, it's something you learn from bitter experience
[16:43:16] <miskander> I guess I am learning…. :P
[16:43:17] <Whirl3d> But it might still work. just pass them as properties of an object   {bottom:dh, right:dw}
[16:43:31] <AlbinoGeek> Does jQuery offer a good way to redirect the browser as if a POST form was submitted? (I know you can create, bind, then .submit a form; but that doesn't seem to function very well across browsers.)
[16:43:39] <Whirl3d> and use jsfiddle. It's so much better for this kind of thing
[16:45:12] <bambu> Whirl3d: JSfiddle wouldn't position the element to the bottom left, and so I did a little tinkering. The active code is on my server.
[16:47:55] <miskander> coldhead: might just switch to 1.4 since even nesting content within divs won't work
[16:48:24] <coldhead> yes i'm having that problem too, miskander
[16:48:28] <Melsom> Could anyone check this out? http://jsfiddle.net/c3n7k/1/ - div class "title" should be updated with slider_h1 value on keyup.
[16:48:44] <coldhead> if you had the energy you could use divs instead of tables and see if they behave better
[16:48:51] <Whirl3d> bambu, sure it will you just need css like I said.
[16:49:12] <miskander> unfortunately divs would multiple my work by 100 hours or so because of the silly design I have to match
[16:49:34] <miskander> might need more than a 6pack of beer for that :P
[16:50:19] <coldhead> miskander: i was also experimenting with opacity:0 and fadeIn()
[16:50:24] <coldhead> no dice there either
[16:50:30] <coldhead> probably some very simple fix that eludes me
[16:50:36] <coldhead> it's 100F/39C here today
[16:50:41] <coldhead> brain is a bit melted
[16:53:00] <bambu> Whirl3d: look here
[16:53:40] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: There's a much easier way, something that makes me actually hate jQuery for animations now;
[16:53:54] <coldhead> care to share?
[16:54:14] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: opacity:0 -> $(element).style.transition = '1s all';
[16:54:24] <AlbinoGeek> or CSS ' element { transition: 1s all } '
[16:54:32] <coldhead> oh wow
[16:54:34] <AlbinoGeek> Supported in EVERY browser (CSS2+)
[16:54:39] <coldhead> that's very broad
[16:54:41] <AlbinoGeek> You can even speciify linear, etc
[16:54:48] <coldhead> yeah, cool
[16:54:52] <AlbinoGeek> It will transition between any CSS state changes, such as opacity, height, width, etc
[16:55:14] <coldhead> someone *cough* should do a plugin for that
[16:55:20] <AlbinoGeek> ^ No plugin required.
[16:55:24] <bambu> http://jsfiddle.net/6sWLf/1/
[16:55:35] <bambu> My I must have missed it before.
[16:55:41] <AlbinoGeek> Instead of:  $(this).fadeIn();  -> $(this).style('opacity', 1);
[16:55:45] <AlbinoGeek> (to show)  etc.
[16:56:09] <bambu> I read the docs, tried it, but on my server it failed because I forgot jsfiddle uses the dropbox for cohssing jquery :p
[16:56:30] <AlbinoGeek> I don't use jsfiddle anymore, too many problems.
[16:56:33] <AlbinoGeek> Ever tried Tinker?
[16:56:34] <bambu> I also didn't call external Jquery in for test.html :p *slaps face*
[16:56:47] <bambu> I'm good, haven't yet a bug.
[16:56:59] <Melsom> Could anyone check this out? http://jsfiddle.net/c3n7k/1/ - div class "title" should be updated with slider_h1 value on keyup.
[16:57:03] <bambu> I prefer VIM or Emacs though.
[16:57:10] <AlbinoGeek> bambu: Try copying the share link in FF17.  You can't use any control+key since the browser hijacks the control key.
[16:57:23] <bambu> shhh
[16:57:25] <bambu> off topic.
[16:57:27] <djQuery> grrrr silly buttons http://jsbin.com/aluwum/2/edit       any idea why my buttons are appearing on different lines?
[16:59:17] <coldhead> AlbinoGeek: i meant a plugin to inject the relevant CSS for you
[16:59:26] <coldhead> so you don't have a CSS dependency
[17:00:24] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: CSS Dependancy?  What has jQuery turned into X_X
[17:00:41] <AlbinoGeek> CSS is core of a site... not just some additional thing you can go without
[17:01:32] <coldhead> but if you're using jQuery to do the animations... makes sense to have jQuery add the CSS for you
[17:01:36] <coldhead> it's a matter of taste
[17:01:44] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery, what would i know
[17:01:57] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Depends on the nature of the animation.
[17:02:02] <coldhead> nothing, i know nothing
[17:02:23] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Say you have a button that shows/hides a sidebar, it makes sense to have a .sidebarHidden class you just use jQuery to add or rmemove.
[17:02:43] <coldhead> yes, quite
[17:03:04] <djQuery> or even just toggles it
[17:03:42] <AlbinoGeek> djQuery: Yeah, .toggleClass
[17:04:13] <djQuery> I can never get buttons to look right
[17:06:27] <bambu> Any ideas?  Error: TypeError: $(...).on is not a function :: $("body").on("click", "a", function(){alert(1);});
[17:09:40] <Melsom> Could anyone help me out a little bit?
[17:09:49] <coldhead> ?ask
[17:09:49] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:10:01] <ghargoil> hehe
[17:10:06] <coldhead> we could already be helping you! :)
[17:10:14] <Melsom> http://jsfiddle.net/c3n7k/1/ - I have this code, and I'm trying to get slider_h1's value in div with class "title" on keyup.
[17:10:21] <Melsom> ... can't even explain it right.
[17:10:23] <ghargoil> I'm having some trouble figuring out how to call my function from jquery
[17:10:51] <ghargoil> I did $('<css selector>').click(myFunc(this));
[17:10:53] <ghargoil> but it doesn't launch
[17:10:58] <Melsom> On slider_h1 keyup, it should update .title with its value.
[17:11:00] <ghargoil> if I replace myFunc with what my func does... it works.
[17:11:12] <ghargoil> and if I call myfunc by itself, with the element, it works
[17:11:25] <Melsom> prev, next, parent, sibling.. can't seem to figure it out :/
[17:11:54] <ghargoil> Melsom: maybe a pastebin? :S
[17:12:00] <ghargoil> I should eat my own words too
[17:12:03] <Melsom> :)

[17:12:50] <Melsom> ghargoil: http://jsfiddle.net/c3n7k/1/
[17:13:02] <ghargoil> oh that is cool
[17:13:24] <coldhead> Melsom: http://jsfiddle.net/c3n7k/3/
[17:13:43] <ghargoil> I should probably run jsfiddle too
[17:13:44] <Melsom> its that simple, huh?
[17:13:46] <Melsom> damn..
[17:14:02] <Melsom> coldhead: thank you so much! :)
[17:14:16] <coldhead> very welcome
[17:17:09] <ghargoil> coldhead: do you think you can look at mine too?
[17:17:57] <coldhead> pastebin is a disincliner but sure
[17:18:13] <ghargoil> http://jsfiddle.net/kCjfv/
[17:18:16] <ghargoil> there, jsfiddle
[17:18:17] <ghargoil> :p
[17:18:22] <coldhead> merci
[17:20:11] <coldhead> ghargoil: http://jsfiddle.net/kCjfv/1/
[17:20:28] <coldhead> be lazier, use `this` and you don't have to try to pass it explicitly
[17:21:08] <ghargoil> coldhead: awesome!
[17:21:10] <ghargoil> thanks D
[17:21:12] <ghargoil> :D
[17:21:17] <coldhead> no problem, have fun
[17:21:17] <ghargoil> oh
[17:21:20] <ghargoil> and is there a way to err
[17:21:34] <ghargoil> tell which...... index of li I am receiving?
[17:21:40] <ghargoil> I mean, when you look at the children of ul
[17:21:56] <coldhead> ?index
[17:21:57] <bot-t> .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[17:22:27] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/kCjfv/2/
[17:22:54] <ghargoil> this jsfiddle thing is pretty cool
[17:23:17] <ghargoil> oh, how do I see the console log?
[17:23:17] <coldhead> certainly saves iterations
[17:23:29] <coldhead> open the web inspector console/firebug console
[17:23:41] <coldhead> view > developer tools in chrome
[17:23:42] * ghargoil reloads page/
[17:23:45] <coldhead> or right click inspect element
[17:23:48] <ghargoil> ahh
[17:23:48] <ghargoil> ok
[17:23:56] <ghargoil> nicee!
[17:24:00] <ghargoil> it even works for all the generic blahs
[17:24:48] <coldhead> is that bad?
[17:25:03] <ghargoil> no, its excellent
[17:25:04] <ghargoil> :D
[17:25:09] <ghargoil> I was worried it'd stumble
[17:25:59] <coldhead> oh good
[17:26:05] <coldhead> happy hacking
[17:26:06] <ghargoil> oh wait
[17:26:07] <ghargoil> hrm
[17:26:13] <ghargoil> no way to pass this explicitly?
[17:26:16] <coldhead> >_>
[17:26:20] <coldhead> why do you need to?
[17:26:21] <ghargoil> or thats very bad?
[17:26:25] <ghargoil> that sounds like its very bad
[17:26:25] <coldhead> `this` is the JS way
[17:26:25] <b-ot> coldhead, memorised “this`”.
[17:26:26] <ghargoil> lol
[17:26:30] <coldhead> oh thanks b-ot
[17:26:33] <coldhead> thanks for nothing
[17:26:38] * coldhead beats b-ot 
[17:26:43] <ghargoil> I want to deselect other lis
[17:26:44] <ghargoil> :p
[17:27:18] <ghargoil> wait
[17:27:19] <ghargoil> I think I got it.
[17:28:31] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/kCjfv/4/
[17:28:40] <coldhead> better to separate your CSS and your JS
[17:28:52] <coldhead> so if a designer needs to mess with the style they won't destroy the universe
[17:29:17] <ghargoil> yeah, I will do that
[17:29:26] <ghargoil> right now I'm trying to just get the functionality working
[17:29:29] <ghargoil> this is going into QT
[17:29:32] <ghargoil> and into a desktop app
[17:29:32] <ghargoil> :p
[17:29:40] <coldhead> oh wow, have fun with that
[17:29:43] <ghargoil> hehehe
[17:29:45] <ghargoil> so far so good
[17:29:51] <ghargoil> really... I'm starting to like QT alot
[17:30:05] <ghargoil> if you ever have to do something like that, I highly recommend looking into QT first :p
[17:30:19] <ghargoil> (plus, there are good bindings for pretty much any language you like)
[17:30:25] <coldhead> i hope it never comes to that
[17:30:54] <ghargoil> hehe
[17:31:02] <ghargoil> its my first time doing a desktop app
[17:31:04] <ghargoil> (with a UI)
[17:31:17] <coldhead> i'm happy it's going well
[17:31:27] <coldhead> i never meddle in those things
[17:31:31] <coldhead> know your limits
[17:31:40] <coldhead> i am limited to a text editor, and a browser if i really need it
[17:31:55] <ghargoil> hehe
[17:32:00] <ghargoil> hardcore
[17:32:16] <coldhead> i'm too old for new things
[17:32:20] <coldhead> like "gui"s
[17:32:28] <ghargoil> I too, prefer the console
[17:32:50] <ghargoil> my favorite type of programming is input file with numbers, output new file with new numbers :p
[17:33:22] <coldhead> you might be a mathematician
[17:33:30] <ghargoil> a crappy one
[17:33:31] <ghargoil> :p[
[17:33:42] <Fenikkusu> Has anyone ever done an AutoLoad type system with jQ or JS in general?
[17:33:54] <coldhead> you mean like requireJS Fenikkusu ?
[17:33:59] <coldhead> or yepnope?
[17:34:18] <Fenikkusu> coldhead, Possibly. I'm coming more from a PHP background. I'll take a look at those.
[17:34:22] <Fenikkusu> Thank
[17:34:24] <Fenikkusu> Thanks*
[17:34:59] <ghargoil> aw, no binding for QT and Javascript
[17:35:00] <coldhead> Fenikkusu: the yepnope author is on #jQuery if you need support
[17:35:23] <coldhead> ghargoil: https://github.com/arturadib/node-qt ?
[17:35:40] <ghargoil> nice, I guess there is :p
[17:35:46] <raj> besides starting `.find` with '>', is there a method to find just the next decendent of a parent? for example, trying to avoid doing `tbl.find('> tbody')` and would rather do `tbl.child('tbody')`
[17:36:09] <coldhead> ?children
[17:36:09] <bot-t> .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[17:36:12] <coldhead> that accepts a filter
[17:36:30] <SlexAxton> yepnope is ralphholzmann 's lib, right?
[17:36:30] <raj> so that's even messier the, no?
[17:36:51] <coldhead> i hardly think ralph would do a thing like that
[17:36:56] <ghargoil> also, coldhead: thanks a lot for the help earlier :D
[17:37:17] <coldhead> do you get notified for yepnope Slex? <3
[17:37:43] <SlexAxton> author* actually
[17:37:55] <coldhead> ahahaha
[17:38:07] <coldhead> i bet ben is hooked up for "plugin"
[17:38:43] <raj> nm, thanks coldhead
[17:38:45] <coldhead> raj: none of those are offensively messy to me
[17:38:54] <coldhead> but i am pretty sloppy i guess
[17:38:56] <raj> i misunderstood what you meant by filter
[17:39:11] <coldhead> oh, sorry, yes, selector not function
[17:39:16] <coldhead> i misled
[17:39:20] <coldhead> i am scum
[17:39:24] <raj> no worries
[17:39:45] <ghargoil> ?class
[17:39:46] <bot-t> .class: Selects all elements with the given class. http://api.jquery.com/class-selector/
[17:40:00] <raj> you usually are, but I see you solving people's actual issues today ;)
[17:40:17] <coldhead> good point, i'll stop that
[17:40:26] <raj> nono, I support this
[17:40:29] <raj> ++coldhead
[17:40:30] <coldhead> YIS CIN ALL GIT FARKED
[17:42:18] <ghargoil> so whats the difference between sizzle and jquery? is jquery built on sizzle?
[17:42:56] <coldhead> yes
[17:43:35] <ghargoil> ah cool
[17:49:50] <Fenikkusu> I'm going through the code of yepnope atm. I also glanced at requireJS. I'm noticing that both are using toString.call(fn) == '[object Function'. Is this a best practice thing? Why not use 'function' == (typeof fn)?
[17:50:10] <coldhead> SlexAxton: ^^
[17:51:44] <AlbinoGeek> How do I go about removing all functions set with .click .change etc on a jQuery object (or object(s)) before adding another?
[17:52:42] <AlbinoGeek> I've noticed that ther's a .unbind() but that seems to interfere with other things.
[17:54:38] <someprimetime> how can I get this to stop when it reaches the end of the right container? http://jsfiddle.net/RTyLa/2/
[17:54:41] <someprimetime> right now it's being jenny
[17:54:45] <someprimetime> s/nn/nk
[17:55:08] <b1lly> stop what
[17:57:06] <someprimetime> the sticky container
[17:57:09] <someprimetime> top left
[17:57:43] <b1lly> sec
[17:59:43] <djQuery> shouldnt this be able to close a dialog from a button in the dialog? $(this).closest('.ui-dialog').dialog('close');
[17:59:50] <jost> can anyone point me to a jQuery plugin that allow for a cross-browser way to do XSL transformations?
[18:00:19] <jost> All I found was last updated years ago
[18:00:37] <AlbinoGeek> In fact, .unbind doesn't appear to be unbinding it at all.
[18:00:39] <AlbinoGeek> Nor does .off
[18:01:40] <AlbinoGeek> URI: http://partshub.ca/home  Notice how the POST is called 1 time the first time, 3-4 times the second, and almost 9 the third?  Wtf?
[18:01:54] <someprimetime> bind/unbind just call on/off internally btw
[18:02:25] <AlbinoGeek> someprimetime: Well, neither seem to want to work sadly.
[18:02:37] <MiracleBlue> Hey guys
[18:02:48] <AlbinoGeek> And if I set the event once outside the recurse (ex: before the li exxist) then it doesn't bind at all.
[18:02:51] <coldhead> hey MiracleBlue
[18:02:56] <MiracleBlue> :D coldhead!
[18:02:57] <MiracleBlue> Sup

[18:04:44] <MiracleBlue> Why are you keeping a low profile though?
[18:04:54] <someprimetime> cold head can you scope my sticky div above please for no dollars and no cents because i'm broke
[18:05:01] <coldhead> so people won't give me tasks or feedback
[18:05:04] <MiracleBlue> Haha
[18:05:05] <MiracleBlue> Right, I see.
[18:05:13] <MiracleBlue> I'm at home sick.
[18:05:23] <coldhead> someprimetime: you know way more about this stuff than me
[18:05:34] <AlbinoGeek> C_C Nobody seems to have any idea what's going on as per my issue, that's unfortunate.
[18:05:38] <AlbinoGeek> I'm at a bit of a standstill atm.
[18:05:41] <thisboy> MiracleBlue: I thought coldhead was a girl?
[18:05:45] <someprimetime> agh sticky containers are my bane
[18:05:52] <MiracleBlue> thisboy: I dunno *shrug*
[18:06:04] <coldhead> it doesn't matter
[18:06:06] <MiracleBlue> I'm indifferent.  I call everyone dude and man.

[18:09:20] <b1lly> coldhead: ? :O
[18:09:51] <djQuery> $(this).closest('.ui-dialog').dialog("close");      Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on dialog prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'option'
[18:10:07] <b1lly> djQuery: what do you think that means?
[18:10:18] <djQuery> but doing a console.log does show the correct dialog
[18:10:54] <djQuery> dang I know what it is its expecting the close on the original iv
[18:11:16] <djQuery> div rather not the div that the dialog sorounds it with
[18:11:50] <coldhead> AlbinoGeek: http://jsfiddle.net/Q8PW4/ non?
[18:11:56] <someprimetime> b1lly: thanks *bowdown*
[18:12:16] <coldhead> b1lly: that fulsome praise is what i'm talking about <3
[18:12:22] <coldhead> ^^
[18:12:35] <b1lly> coldhead: O_O

[18:16:40] <MiracleBlue> Untz untz untz untz
[18:17:19] * EyePulp forgot about the thursday night rave.
[18:17:25] <EyePulp> dang it!
[18:17:38] <MiracleBlue> I'm having my own little rave in my studio :)
[18:17:42] <MiracleBlue> Working on new tunes.
[18:18:55] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Yeah, but what of http://partshub.ca/home ?
[18:19:04] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Page JS at the bottom.
[18:19:22] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Click on "Make" (quick parts find) to trigger.  Then select a make, model, etc.
[18:20:29] <b1lly> AlbinoGeek: fail
[18:21:07] <coldhead> AlbinoGeek: you seem to be using off() rather than off('click')
[18:21:11] <coldhead> i don't know if that works
[18:21:18] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Well, .unbind is supposed to unbind everything.
[18:21:24] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: off should do the same, no?
[18:21:31] <coldhead> not that i can see in the docs
[18:21:51] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: I'll switch that to off('click')  then... moment
[18:22:01] <coldhead> the signature for off() doesn't have any [optionals]
[18:22:02] <b1lly> .off(events [,selector]...)
[18:22:07] <coldhead> like unbind() does
[18:22:22] <coldhead> or rather it expects at least one
[18:22:30] <coldhead> it's not an alias for unbind()
[18:22:43] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Nope, it still calls it many tmies.
[18:22:49] <coldhead> gross
[18:23:09] <b1lly> AlbinoGeek: your using it wrong
[18:23:12] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Tried .off('click').on(exClick); and it still calls exClick numerous times when it's clicked.
[18:23:30] <b1lly> why are you rebinding it
[18:23:53] <AlbinoGeek> b1lly: Because if you bind before setting data, it doesn't exist ; nothing gets bound (so I can't bound it outside the POST).
[18:24:06] <AlbinoGeek> If I bind it normally, it binds numerous times; hence the off reset attempt.
[18:24:14] <b1lly> AlbinoGeek: what
[18:24:25] <b1lly> AlbinoGeek: what are you trying to do
[18:24:27] <coldhead> what about .off('click', exClick)
[18:24:36] <coldhead> to match the params to on()
[18:24:40] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: That's required too?  Alright, trying.
[18:24:43] <coldhead> it looks like it might care about that
[18:25:02] <b1lly> AlbinoGeek: just use $(document.body).on('click', 'selector', function() { .. });
[18:25:16] <AlbinoGeek> coldhead: Still does numerous times.
[18:25:23] <coldhead> i'm with b1lly, rebinding is icky
[18:25:34] <AlbinoGeek> b1lly: That works even if "selector" doesn't exist at all when I attempt to bind it?
[18:25:53] <b1lly> yeah
[18:25:59] <b1lly> thats the purpose of on...
[18:26:06] <b1lly> otherwise you use just bind :)
[18:26:14] <coldhead> $('body').on('click', '.something_that_doesnt_exist_yet', foo)
[18:26:18] <coldhead> works
[18:26:40] <b1lly> $(document.body) renders faster then $('body')
[18:26:56] <coldhead> no doubt, i was copying from the docs
[18:27:12] <b1lly> shigity shwaggg
[18:27:34] <b1lly> sometimes document.body doesn't work but it should be used when it can, in replace of $('body')
[18:27:51] <coldhead> $('something_closer_than_body') is preferred :)
[18:28:05] <b1lly> ^
[18:28:23] <coldhead> they should update the docs to encourage that
[18:28:34] <coldhead> although i do enjoy when BinaryKitten yells at people for it
[18:28:39] <coldhead> so maybe it's better this way
[18:28:52] <b1lly> AlbinoGeek: may I message you?
[18:29:10] <coldhead> you should let him, AlbinoGeek, b1lly is A++ cyber
[18:29:18] <sahbeewah> why are you binding and rebinding the same function
[18:29:27] <sahbeewah> unbinding
[18:29:57] <coldhead> sahbeewah: we wants to bind it once to every element after new elements are added
[18:30:05] <coldhead> and is now being encouraged to use delegation
[18:33:22] <AlbinoGeek> b1lly: ?  Sure message me, sorry I wans't here.
[18:33:31] <sahbeewah> i think the more glaring problem is that the part images on the website aren't being thumbnailed
[18:33:49] <sahbeewah> i shouldn't be downloading 2Mb on a page load
[18:33:54] <coldhead> in due course, sahbeewah
[18:34:06] <coldhead> make it work, then make it fast
[18:39:08] <MiracleBlue> Oh man
[18:39:17] <b1lly> Oh MiracleBlue
[18:39:29] <MiracleBlue> There's a massive bushfire going on to the east of where I live
[18:39:33] <MiracleBlue> Quite far east, but still.
[18:39:38] <b1lly> why are you home programming
[18:39:51] <MiracleBlue> My Facebook is now just full of posts from the CFA with emergency warnings for the towns over that way.
[18:40:04] <MiracleBlue> Well, I'm not under threat :) but still, it's a crazy fire day today.
[18:40:14] <b1lly> where you from
[18:40:18] <MiracleBlue> Australia.
[18:40:25] <b1lly> lovely
[18:40:29] <MiracleBlue> Yep

[18:42:47] <MiracleBlue> Yessir.
[18:42:53] <MiracleBlue> I'm in Melbourne.

[18:45:45] <MiracleBlue> Jesus
[18:45:50] <MiracleBlue> It's only 22 here
[18:46:27] <MiracleBlue> sahbeewah: It's turned out to be quite the fire season hasn't it?
[18:48:05] <sahbeewah> yeah apparently there's 84 bushfires happening simultaneously atm in nsw
[18:48:22] <sahbeewah> it's nice
[18:49:40] <MiracleBlue> Yeah man
[18:49:42] <MiracleBlue> Crazy.
[18:50:11] <coldhead> are you out west sahbeewah ?
[18:52:27] <MiracleBlue> coldhead: Where you from?
[18:52:49] <jost> Does anyone know a good jQuery plugin (or other JS-Script) that transforms an XSL-Transformation using the browser XSLT-Processor?
[18:53:01] <sahbeewah> somewhat west
[18:53:19] <coldhead> sydernee
[18:53:23] <coldhead> i'm in the CBD now
[18:53:26] <MiracleBlue> Hehe
[18:53:26] <coldhead> it's perishingly hot
[18:53:31] <MiracleBlue> Oh, syden-knee
[18:53:32] <coldhead> i wish we were all dead
[18:53:39] <coldhead> and i suspect we will soon have that wish granted
[18:53:39] <Fall> ha I'm on Kent St
[18:53:40] <MiracleBlue> I used to live n Janalli
[18:53:42] <Fall> not a bad walk
[18:53:49] <coldhead> 2000 represent!
[18:53:49] <MiracleBlue> I'm originally from Canberra
[18:53:50] <Fall> was only outside for 5 minutes all up
[18:53:55] <Fall> coldhead ^5
[18:53:56] <Fall> ;)
[18:54:36] <sahbeewah> i'm on bathurst st normally
[18:54:44] <sahbeewah> working from home today
[18:54:58] <coldhead> wise move
[18:55:05] <coldhead> i only came it because the office aircon is arctic
[18:55:09] <coldhead> i have frostbite
[18:56:21] <Fenikkusu> If I'm building a pluging, say $.fn.tf = {method : function(){}, method2 : function(){}}, is there an easy way to access method2 from method  without having to use $.fn.tf? IE, can I use $.fn.tf = {} then use var tThis = $.fn.tf and then follow with $.fn.tf.prototype = {}?
[18:59:50] <AlbinoGeek> <coldhead /><!-- What a short life -->
[19:00:18] <MiracleBlue> sahbeewah, coldhead: what work do you guys do?
[19:00:34] <popof_> jquery's animate() uses css3 animators right?
[19:03:36] <sahbeewah> webdev
[19:03:43] <sahbeewah> popof_, no
[19:04:13] <popof_> sahbeewah: oh. which then is faster?
[19:04:15] <popof_> sahbeewah: for say, animating a width
[19:04:38] <MiracleBlue> sahbeewah: Digital Agency type stuff?
[19:06:34] <sahbeewah> popof_, well considering jquery relies on css2, and css3 is native, i'd say css3
[19:06:40] <sahbeewah> don't quote me on that, i don't actually know
[19:07:15] <popof_> sahbeewah: hrm Ill look around, thanks!
[19:07:48] <sahbeewah> MiracleBlue, no it's something else, rather not say
[19:07:55] <MiracleBlue> sahbeewah: Ah ok, no worries :)
[19:08:06] <MiracleBlue> I used to work in digital agencies, nearly killed me.
[19:08:15] <coldhead> MiracleBlue: not very interesting social analytics stuff
[19:08:24] <MiracleBlue> Just got a new job developing eLearning software though
[19:08:29] <coldhead> i miss digital agencies, they have better parties
[19:08:34] <MiracleBlue> coldhead: I think everything is interesting
[19:08:37] <sisb> is .quickEach() or .each2() still relevant with the latest jQuery?
[19:08:43] <MiracleBlue> I just don't deal with stress too well
[19:08:49] <MiracleBlue> And Das are like pressure cookers
[19:09:12] <cusco> I dislike stress, but enjoy working underpressure
[19:09:23] <MiracleBlue> Ah yeah.
[19:09:29] <MiracleBlue> I know what you mean.
[19:09:45] <MiracleBlue> I don't enjoy working under pressure at all, but it is a good motivator.
[19:10:09] <cusco> problem with working under pressure, is organization
[19:10:50] <cusco> if you have that, its just the time you put into the keyboard
[19:11:26] <MiracleBlue> I'm not terribly good with time management.
[19:11:28] <MiracleBlue> I need to get better at it.
[19:15:52] <coldhead> i just like getting baked and being left alone
[19:16:00] <Fall> hmmm
[19:16:00] <coldhead> but there is no job that pays you to do that
[19:16:16] <coldhead> my human rights are being violated
[19:18:03] <tw2113> which human right is it that's getting violated?
[19:18:16] <coldhead> the right to be left alone and stoned
[19:18:25] <coldhead> it's in the bill of rights or something
[19:18:35] <grafi> is it?
[19:18:44] <coldhead> i am a stoner, i haven't checked
[19:19:04] <grafi> the correct answer would have been "i dont know and i dont care"
[19:20:07] * coldhead takes notes
[19:20:32] <grafi> as if
[19:20:56] <sisb> coldhead: send me your resume
[19:20:57] <coldhead> i have a fountain pen!
[19:21:03] <sisb> via pm
[19:21:13] <tw2113> i won't argue with those two about how they should be rights if not already
[19:21:20] <coldhead> why would i do that, sisb ? i want less work, not more
[19:21:37] <tw2113> getting paid at the same time would be, unless that was the job description
[19:21:41] <sisb> because this work involves being left alone more
[19:21:47] <on3pk> hm
[19:21:57] <on3pk> #form.submit() doesn't seem to do anything
[19:22:09] <grafi> that must be an interesting job sisb
[19:22:10] <coldhead> ahahah i appreciate the offer but i am overcommited
[19:22:15] <coldhead> +1 for hiring stoners from IRC
[19:22:26] <sisb> np still looking for another front-end person
[19:22:29] <sisb> :P
[19:22:52] <grafi> but do you really want a front end person who is constantly at [10]
[19:23:09] <sisb> grafi: it actually is an interesting project
[19:23:30] <sisb> grafi im not into reddit dialect, but sure
[19:23:48] <sisb> I only know that from the snoop dogg thread
[19:23:49] <grafi> and yet you know what im talking about
[19:24:59] <sisb> Shameless ad: Will hire stoners off IRC for good money and great fun in SF bay area! lmao
[19:25:26] <Fall> ;D
[19:26:02] <sisb> interns too
[19:26:14] <imsky> i only work for cashe mone
[19:26:25] <sisb> done dazzle
[19:31:54] <on3pk> hey guys... Can I call the submit function at the same time I stopped the default action of the submit button?
[19:32:22] <greg5green> yes
[19:32:28] <AlbinoGeek> b1lly Figured the issue :)
[19:32:46] <b1lly> WINNAR!
[19:35:28] <on3pk> greg5green, hm.
[19:35:32] <on3pk> I can't seem to get it to work
[19:36:25] <b1lly> get what to work
[19:36:26] <greg5green> on3pk, you are putting arguments in your .submit() call, right?
[19:36:35] <b1lly> you can stop it and call it yes
[19:37:03] <b1lly> .submit(function() { return false; })
[19:37:12] <greg5green> or you could
[19:37:32] <on3pk> http://pastie.org/5713160
[19:37:35] <greg5green> $('element').on('click', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $(this).submit(); }
[19:37:36] <on3pk> thats what I have
[19:37:40] <greg5green> );
[19:39:06] <grafi> maybe its an endless loop?
[19:39:21] <greg5green> on3pk, are you getting any errors in your console? Are any network requests 404'ing or something in your network tab?
[19:39:48] <on3pk> uhm, there is a 404 request, but, its unrelated to the form
[19:40:01] <on3pk> it also hasn't stopped any of the other functionality from working
[19:40:27] <sisb> Does the other functionality happen above the 404 line in the code and is this one below it?
[19:40:40] <on3pk> no, it is all below the 404
[19:41:23] <b1lly> just put return false;
[19:41:26] <b1lly> in an if condition
[19:41:45] <grafi> on3pk what is the element you are attaching the handler to?
[19:41:47] <b1lly> if (phone.length) { ... } else { return false; }
[19:42:02] <b1lly> on3pk: do what I said and you win
[19:43:14] <b1lly> just put return false after your $('#jQueryErrMsg')..
[19:43:58] <on3pk> b1lly, I have some bad news for you.  didn't work.
[19:44:10] <b1lly> oh woops
[19:44:24] <b1lly> change $('#submit').click
[19:44:26] <on3pk> grafi, I guess I'm using the $(#submitButton).click() to stop the form from being submitted in the first place, if thats wha tyou mean
[19:44:32] <b1lly> to $('form').submit(function(
[19:44:52] <b1lly> and remove that inner form submit
[19:45:39] <b1lly> http://jsfiddle.net/tXkKx/1/
[19:45:41] <b1lly> like that
[19:45:47] <b1lly> err
[19:46:03] <b1lly> http://jsfiddle.net/tXkKx/2/
[19:49:16] <on3pk> xchat froze
[19:49:31] <b1lly> http://jsfiddle.net/tXkKx/2/
[19:49:31] <b1lly> ^
[19:51:31] <on3pk> b1lly, that doesn't seem to stop the form from being submitted before the calculations are done
[19:51:39] <b1lly> it will
[19:52:48] <on3pk> b1lly, it doesn't seem to be setting the #e164 value
[19:53:32] <b1lly> idk what that function does
[19:54:22] <on3pk> well, what its supposed to do is set a hidden fields value...  Though it could also change the phone field's value as well...
[19:54:56] <idletask> Hello
[19:55:03] <on3pk> basically format a telephone number, then send the form on its merry way
[19:55:42] <idletask> New JQuery user (and JavaScript for that matter)... To select all elements of a certain class, is $(document).find(".class")?
[19:57:58] <b1lly> $('.class').
[19:58:59] <on3pk> b1lly, it also isn't alerting for me... :|
[19:59:01] <raj> when do I use .bind() and when .on() for 'clickoutside'?
[19:59:01] <idletask> b1lly: yes, that works too
[20:04:50] <b1lly> the selector may be wrong
[20:04:52] <b1lly> at the top
[20:06:43] <sisb> on3pk put  'e.preventDefault();e.stopPropagation();e.stopImmediatePropagation();' immediately after the ,function(e) {
[20:07:01] <b1lly> sisb: that's not required...
[20:07:08] <sisb> just to test it out
[20:07:22] <b1lly> sisb: not the problem
[20:07:34] <grafi> still not submitting then?
[20:08:00] <sisb> What is the problem?
[20:08:10] <b1lly> don't know what his markup looks like
[20:08:29] <grafi> its nice how you provide a solution and are now asking what the actual problem is ;)
[20:08:43] <b1lly> me?
[20:08:49] <grafi> no sisb
[20:08:49] <sisb> I thought I know what it was, guess not, and now it's way too far up in the chat
[20:08:55] <imsky> you don't need stopImmediatePropagation
[20:09:38] <imsky> pick one or the other
[20:09:51] <sisb> I didn't include it for a need
[20:10:02] <imsky> why did you include it then
[20:11:38] <sisb> To be helpful
[20:11:42] <on3pk> hm
[20:11:55] <on3pk> it looks like the remote javascript I was loading got messed up somehow
[20:12:11] <imsky> lol
[20:12:24] <imsky> it's not helpful when you don't know what the difference is
[20:13:10] <b1lly> http://jsfiddle.net/tXkKx/4/
[20:13:11] <sisb> How do you know I don't know what the difference is?
[20:13:30] <imsky> sisb: does stopImmediatePropagation call stopPropagation?
[20:13:58] <b1lly> that example works fine
[20:13:58] <sisb> Yes
[20:14:07] <sisb> That's not why I included it
[20:14:20] <sisb> Nor does it mean I don't understand it
[20:14:23] <b1lly> its not required so Idk what your aruging about
[20:14:43] <on3pk> so, what happened was it tried to format the number but, got messed up there
[20:14:57] <b1lly> fix your function
[20:15:04] <b1lly> problem solved? :D
[20:15:27] <on3pk> b1lly, looks like it!
[20:15:30] <on3pk> Thanks for your help
[20:15:43] <b1lly>  np
[20:18:21] <raj> I'm creating `function makeMenu(container, options) {var test = options['test'] || 'hello'}` ...however, if `options` is not passed to the function, what is the js way of handling this scenario?
[20:19:01] <b1lly> have you tried?
[20:19:10] <raj> obviously
[20:20:05] <b1lly> see #javascript
[20:25:48] <austinpray> hey guys
[20:25:52] <austinpray> hey guys
[20:28:18] <coldhead> hi austinpray
[20:28:40] <austinpray> How do you guys represent an image that you can click and view in a lightbox?
[20:29:03] <coldhead> you mean in the html?
[20:29:41] <coldhead> depends on the lightbox plugin but often it's <a href="big.jpg"><img src="small.jpg"></a>
[20:29:54] <austinpray> no I mean like user interface design
[20:30:10] <cusco> ?
[20:30:49] <austinpray> Like should I just put a little banner on it that says "view full image"
[20:30:50] <austinpray> or what?
[20:31:06] <austinpray> basically how do I make it clear to the user that they can click it and enlarge it
[20:31:52] <cusco> on mouseover, some resize effect?
[20:32:07] <cusco> so it animates, thus showing interactivity?
[20:32:15] <cusco> or border changing collor? dunno
[20:32:17] <b1lly> austinpray:
[20:32:17] <austinpray> but what about touch?
[20:32:27] <b1lly> alot of people use different ways
[20:32:52] <b1lly> put an icon on it
[20:32:55] <b1lly> :D
[20:33:04] <cusco> touch, just make it a incon touchy like
[20:33:18] <austinpray> yeah I'll just put a little icon in the top right
[20:34:10] <coldhead> magnifying glass
[20:35:04] <austinpray> aww yiss
[20:35:41] <austinpray> wow my girlfriend is smart
[20:35:50] <austinpray> "look at online shopping websites and see what they have"
[20:36:22] <Marcky> is it possible to send multiple object as options for jquery dialog?
[20:36:30] <madabyss> Hey guys - using juery mobile in conjunction with codeingiter. Submitting a form and want to use the native ajax funtionality but getting undefined as a result. When i use data-ajax="false" it works find.. how to circumvent?
[20:36:31] <b1lly> yes
[20:36:35] <b1lly> well
[20:36:37] <b1lly> no
[20:36:39] <Marcky> lets say I have buch of dialogs wich all have constantoptions
[20:36:46] <b1lly> differnt options?
[20:36:48] <b1lly> same options
[20:36:53] <coldhead> SAME
[20:36:59] <Marcky> constant options*
[20:37:18] <Marcky> so id like to do something like
[20:38:05] <Marcky> $("div").dialog("options",constansOptions,{other: noneConstantsOptions})
[20:39:06] <madabyss> (anyone) issue for madabyss^
[20:48:15] <madabyss> nm got it
[20:48:29] <coldhead> great work madabyss
[20:48:45] <madabyss> coldhead: haha.. thanks
[20:49:20] <Marcky> coldhead: do you have any ideas on how to solver my problem
[20:49:37] <Marcky> solve*
[20:50:00] <coldhead> i don't understand your problem
[20:50:25] <s34n> I have jquerymobile content that gets loaded via ajax and includes a popup.
[20:50:36] <Marcky> well you know jquery dialogs?
[20:50:44] <s34n> I trgger a create on the content so it all gets styled correctly
[20:51:09] <s34n> but the popup is whacky
[20:51:31] <s34n> 1/2 the time it displays without proper markup
[20:52:03] <s34n> the other 1/2 the time, it displays with completely wrong content, using the content of the hosting page instead
[20:54:03] <s34n> I shouldn't say there is not styling. It just isn't normal styling
[20:54:34] <coldhead> i've heard of it, Marcky
[21:00:16] <veQue> https://addons.mozilla.org/ this site wor for anyone?
[21:00:52] <Fenikkusu> If I use $.getScript(), and wish for my script to *pause* for a couple seconds and resume once loaded, how would I do this? Currnetly within my function, I'm thinking to call .getScript with a fail and done passed, then set a variable within these (Scoped in my function) to true when either method fires, then loop with a sleep call till the variable sets. Does this sound good?
[21:06:11] <coldhead> i've done something like that before, Fenikkusu
[21:06:16] <coldhead> it's nothing to be ashamed of
[21:06:25] <coldhead> veQue: yup
[21:06:33] <veQue> weird i say!
[21:06:42] <veQue> it workson my other computer too
[21:06:47] <veQue> i dont know what's going on
[21:06:59] <veQue> hope i've not been haked
[21:07:01] <coldhead> mozilla often has load balancing weirdness
[21:07:27] <coldhead> you can check in with their IRC network if you want to make enquiries
[21:08:20] <veQue> load balancing.. that's omething that would stop one computer from accessing the site and the one right next to it can have acess?
[21:08:25] <veQue> ok i'll do that
[21:08:26] <veQue> thanks
[21:08:39] <Fenikkusu> Well, I'm just trying to get the best method. I want my method to return true or false so that the actual execution pauses for a bit.
[21:10:03] <popof_> is this font discrepancy normal between win and mac? http://i.imgur.com/AXmtu.jpg
[21:10:16] <coldhead> Fenikkusu: might help to know why you want tat
[21:10:18] <coldhead> that*
[21:10:39] <coldhead> but if it's a hugescript i have used the callback for getScript to start polling for some var set in the end of the script
[21:10:48] <coldhead> so you can detect when it's loaded
[21:11:56] <Fenikkusu> Essentially I'm wanting an uber-light-weight requireJS with lazy loading.
[21:12:15] <Fenikkusu> At least that's what I'm aiming at.
[21:12:34] <coldhead> so you want to pause to give lazily loaded scripts time to run?
[21:12:46] <Fenikkusu> Essentially, yes
[21:13:17] <coldhead> tough problem, you can't be sure how long that will take
[21:13:27] <coldhead> and you make very small scripts wait the same time as the big ones
[21:13:48] <Fenikkusu> To a certain degree yes.
[21:14:08] <Fenikkusu> I'm just trying a proof of concept so may not even follow through with the idea.
[21:15:20] <coldhead> oh sure, it's a good exercise
[21:15:46] <coldhead> the folks who did require et al seem to have spent a lot of time on it
[21:17:05] <williamherry> hi, I am use jquery validation and I want to know if I can make one of my field not highlight, it is a file field and I hiddened it
[21:17:16] <williamherry> it will show again when highlight
[21:20:10] <coldhead> display:none!important; should fix that for you
[21:20:59] <williamherry> coldhead: thanks
[21:22:26] <williamherry> it works
[21:22:46] <coldhead> hooray!
[21:22:53] <coldhead> take me down to funky town
[21:23:34] <ghargoil> yeah! funky town!
[21:23:42] <ghargoil> I bought the album
[21:24:04] <coldhead> way to go
[21:24:06] <ghargoil> also, kinda not exactly jquery, but if you got a moment -- how do I get the current text in an input box? value doesn't get it :p
[21:24:16] <ghargoil> (value gets undefined)
[21:24:23] <ghargoil> and firebug shows undefined
[21:24:23] <coldhead> that ain't right
[21:24:30] <coldhead> $('foo').val() ?
[21:24:34] <ghargoil> hrmm
[21:24:36] <ghargoil> maybe val()
[21:24:38] <coldhead> if there's a val that should give you something good
[21:24:46] <coldhead> maybe your selector is borked?
[21:24:51] <ghargoil> aw yeah
[21:24:53] <ghargoil> val()
[21:24:53] <ghargoil> :D
[21:24:56] <ghargoil> thank you :D
[21:24:56] <macinchik> argh i am so annoyed w/scrollbars
[21:25:04] <coldhead> no problemo
[21:25:22] <macinchik> why mousedown but not mouseup
[21:25:36] <coldhead> who knows, man
[21:25:38] <macinchik> google is so perverse
[21:26:03] <coldhead> you bear such a likeness to someone i think i knew in the time when our time was running out
[21:34:36] <doncabrera> hi guys
[21:34:58] <doncabrera> hey there's a way to modify the doom and save it with file_put_contents()?
[21:35:12] <coldhead> lol doom
[21:35:38] <coldhead> $('html').html() should get you the current html for the dom
[21:36:02] <doncabrera> dom
[21:36:36] <Fenikkusu> Well...dang...looks like I can't reasonable do what I want. Any attempt I make will cause the browser to lock until the scripts load...
[21:37:09] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/R6QAE/
[21:37:35] <coldhead> Fenikkusu: did you check the code for require &c to see how they do it?
[21:37:55] <eubey> is there a performance difference in doing $("#something").find('h4'); vs  $("#something h4");   ?
[21:38:26] <systemfault_> The second is slower.
[21:38:43] <systemfault_> Unless of course, you already have a reference to #something in a variable.
[21:38:44] <eubey> interesting. why is that?
[21:39:01] <Fenikkusu> I've not seen it specifically, but require requires you to load everything initially. What I'm talking about is similar to PHP's sp_autoload_register method. I want it to load mid-execution and block that thread until it does.
[21:39:08] <systemfault_> eubey: Because the first one is two lookups… and two lookups is slower than a single one.
[21:39:22] <Fenikkusu> However, this potentially locks the browser down.
[21:39:30] <eubey> so the second would be faster then? systemfault_
[21:39:49] <systemfault_> eubey: Yes.
[21:39:59] <eubey> systemfault_: ok awesome, thanks!
[21:40:19] <coldhead> $('h4', $previously_saved_selection_by_id)
[21:40:29] <coldhead> how's yourself systemfault_
[21:40:32] <coldhead> nice underscore
[21:40:35] <coldhead> suits you
[21:40:39] <systemfault_> It happens :/
[21:40:49] <systemfault_> It's my first day, don't be mean
[21:41:02] <coldhead> Fenikkusu: there's very likely efforts similar to your dream on github
[21:41:09] <coldhead> systemfault_: mine too! samies!
[21:41:16] <Fenikkusu> True
[21:41:17] <coldhead> too slow
[21:41:25] <systemfault> :)
[21:41:27] <doncabrera> any god php chats?
[21:41:37] <systemfault> god php chats… not sure
[21:41:38] <doncabrera> good php chats here on freenode
[21:42:00] <Fenikkusu> ##php
[21:42:03] <systemfault> chats is nicer in french.. means cats
[21:42:05] <doncabrera> I can't get into #php, need to be registered or something
[21:42:14] <systemfault> doncabrera: register your nickname to nickserv
[21:42:32] <doncabrera> how do I do that?
[21:42:35] <doncabrera> it says its private actually
[21:42:45] <systemfault> Then try ##php with two ##
[21:42:47] <doncabrera> you must be 'invited'
[21:42:52] <tfittsy> send a /msg nickserv help
[21:43:01] <tfittsy> doncabrera: if you register your nick you can join.
[21:43:06] <coldhead> le chat noir
[21:43:07] <systemfault> If it doesn't work with ## then follow tfittsy's advice
[21:43:37] <doncabrera> register doncabrera
[21:43:39] <coldhead> there are no nice php chats, phpeople will generally disembowel you as soon as look at you
[21:43:42] <doncabrera> REGISTER doncabrera
[21:43:43] <coldhead> it's their way
[21:44:34] <Fenikkusu> coldhead's right, they can be brutal in ##php, especially TML, but he certainly knows he stuff.
[21:44:59] <systemfault> Ah php.. i hate its users more than the language itself :)
[21:45:00] <coldhead> i am banned from ##php
[21:45:08] <popof_> systemfault: o/
[21:45:19] <systemfault> s/users/most of its users  :P
[21:45:39] <popof_> left me hanging
[21:45:40] <systemfault> I hate myself for using it at work sometimes..
[21:45:42] <popof_> you'll hang for this
[21:45:44] <coldhead> i prefer the first formulation
[21:46:03] <doncabrera> registered. Thanks fellows.
[21:46:08] <systemfault> You're welcome
[21:46:12] <Fenikkusu> lol
[21:46:19] <doncabrera> I'm banned from stackoverflow
[21:46:23] <doncabrera> send the admin to fuck off
[21:46:31] <doncabrera> called him a patsy
[21:46:34] <systemfault> Not the best idea...
[21:46:36] <coldhead> we got an email from rasmus one day because we were exposing our notices and warnings publically. and he ended the email with "KILL ALL GYPSIES! WHITE POWER FOREVER!"
[21:46:48] <systemfault> lol
[21:46:59] <popof_> poor rasmus
[21:47:02] <popof_> his legacy is php
[21:47:12] <coldhead> i think he's proud
[21:47:17] <coldhead> (of his racial purity)
[21:48:12] <systemfault> I wonder if he will ever remove that stupid hebrew error message
[21:48:23] <systemfault> When you have a scoping issue
[21:49:07] <systemfault> T_PAAMAYIM_NEKDOTAYIM :P
[21:49:26] <coldhead> aw i like that bit
[21:49:39] <coldhead> makes me feel like i'm doing something exotic with the kabbalah
[21:49:47] <systemfault> :P
[21:49:50] <coldhead> instead of getting a record from  a database
[21:50:04] <tw2113> coldhead, you nerd
[21:50:17] <coldhead> we use joomla and that really makes everything bad about PHP disappear
[21:50:20] <tw2113> have you taped your glasses back together recently?
[21:50:39] <coldhead> not recently but i have tape at the ready
[21:50:54] <doncabrera> I'm trying to do the %0,0001 of what Mailchimp does
[21:51:00] <tw2113> *smashes an old pop bottle trying to make it sound like broken glasses*
[21:51:02] <doncabrera> with that "create your own template" thingly they hae over there
[21:51:05] <doncabrera> and campaign monitor too
[21:52:45] <coldhead> ambituous
[21:54:23] <coldhead> oh lord whisper low
[21:54:58] * greg5green rolls eyes
[21:55:12] * systemfault is legally downloading creative suite cs2 free from adobe.com (Hard to believe :P )
[21:55:25] <coldhead> doing some eye exercises there greg5green ?
[21:55:49] <greg5green> systemfault, what are you going to do when you try to open a file someone sends you? CS5 can't save anything less than CS4...
[21:55:51] * BinaryKitten yells at coldhead for suggesting she yells at people
[21:56:06] <systemfault> greg5green: At work, I have cs6
[21:56:19] <systemfault> greg5green: For personal projects, at home, cs2 is enough for me.
[21:56:22] <coldhead> hahahahha BinaryKitten  <33
[21:56:25] <greg5green> so you can make files at work that you cant open at home, cool
[21:56:27] <coldhead> it is ENDEARING
[21:56:39] <BinaryKitten> coldhead you're welcome.
[21:56:50] <tw2113> coldhead, is this person bothering you?
[21:56:50] * BinaryKitten returns to hunt for pain killers
[21:56:59] <tw2113> *gives BinaryKitten $()*
[21:57:05] <systemfault> greg5green: I usually don't have the time to work on personal projects at work :/
[21:57:06] <coldhead> we get along just fine tw2113, no boter
[21:57:09] <coldhead> bother*
[21:57:15] <tw2113> i was going to pay her for the fact
[21:57:17] * BinaryKitten shudders at $()
[21:57:30] <greg5green> systemfault: just making sure you knew that you can't open any file that you don't create at home
[21:57:35] <systemfault> Ahh ok :)
[21:58:34] <coldhead> her?! I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY WOMAN IN THIS CHANNEL
[21:58:45] <coldhead> ah gender
[21:58:54] <systemfault> You're a woman today?
[21:58:55] <tw2113> as if it matters
[21:58:59] <systemfault> ASL? PLZ!!!!
[21:59:05] <coldhead> may it continue to divide and intrigue us
[21:59:19] <coldhead> systemfault: I PM U
[21:59:26] <coldhead> WAT U WARE ON
[21:59:29] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[22:00:45] <b1lly> whos got bugs
[22:00:47] <b1lly> bugs bugs bugs
[22:00:50] <b1lly> NOMNOMNOM
[22:01:04] * tw2113 just got called a graphic designer in a message on $datingsite
[22:01:09] <tw2113> guess who's not getting a reply back
[22:01:32] <BinaryKitten> tw2113 message back politely and explain the difference
[22:01:40] <BinaryKitten> then tell them where to go
[22:01:47] <coldhead> it's so hard to explain the difference!!
[22:02:21] <BinaryKitten> designers make it pretty, developers make it work
[22:02:24] <coldhead> "it's like... if you go to a butcher... a designer will do the window display... and i am out the back making sausages"
[22:02:34] <tw2113> "I have a double major in Web Development and Graphic Design, however I don't really use the graphic design half much. My primary income comes from freelance web development work. I am pretty much a full time nerd. "
[22:02:45] <coldhead> that's cute
[22:03:01] <tw2113> i need to fix it, i'm no longer full freelance
[22:03:04] <coldhead> i am pretty much a full time stay at home mom with a job and no kids
[22:03:36] <obert_> i am a designer with programming problems
[22:04:02] <tw2113> lately i've been in debug mode all week, but my fun times involve actual code like php and jquery
[22:04:13] <systemfault> I'm a programmer with design problems
[22:04:32] <tw2113> i'm just me, it's my 2nd day
[22:04:33] <BinaryKitten> i'm a programmer with sysop grandeur
[22:04:33] <obert_> beham [cit.]
[22:04:37] <coldhead> i've got 99 problems but what is design, i don't even
[22:04:49] <BinaryKitten> oh and I'm batman as well
[22:04:50] <obert_> B.Behan [cit.]
[22:04:57] <tw2113> you mean the batman
[22:04:57] <coldhead> good footnoting there obert_, appreciated
[22:05:05] <coldhead> the goddamn batman
[22:05:06] <BinaryKitten> nah tw2113 not the, just a

[22:05:26] <systemfault> I'm batman!
[22:05:27] <obert_> coldhead: thanks ;) the original one was I am a drinker with writing problems
[22:05:32] * BinaryKitten has no clue whi that is
[22:05:47] <coldhead> it doesn't matter BK, just go with it
[22:05:59] <BinaryKitten> oh mick foley's hand puppet thing
[22:06:02] <coldhead> you poor fools still have friday to get through
[22:06:07] <BinaryKitten> not watched WWE since i was a kid.
[22:06:08] <tw2113> :D
[22:06:24] <tw2113> which is about how old your WWE time may be
[22:06:35] <tw2113> it was a good 14 years ago
[22:06:39] <obert_> just older than internet
[22:07:02] <BinaryKitten> I stopped watching before the mergers of the differnt ones..
[22:07:10] <BinaryKitten> anyway
[22:07:33] <BinaryKitten> now i've taken pain killers i'm going back to bed, at least i can get some semblance of a friday morning back
[22:07:40] <tw2113> night binary
[22:07:47] <coldhead> feel better BK!
[22:07:51] <coldhead> rest up for more yellin'
[22:07:55] <systemfault> Hmm have you seen that: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=PSY+curve
[22:08:09] <obert_> shessh it is friday
[22:08:40] <coldhead> that is an indecent amount of mathematics for a family channel
[22:09:49] <systemfault> :'( SOOORYYY
[22:10:22] <obert_> what is a coldhead? the contrary of hothead?
[22:10:39] <systemfault> hotfeet
[22:11:08] <obert_> asking about the meaning not about the word jokes related
[22:11:39] <obert_> hothead isn't someone easily irritable?
[22:12:49] <tw2113> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c1m2BAg2Sc
[22:12:49] <popof_> yeah it is
[22:13:02] <coldhead> don't pigeonhole me man
[22:13:14] <popof_> coldhead goes shush now
[22:13:25] <coldhead> YOU WISH BUDDY
[22:13:30] <obert_> mah, i give up
[22:13:34] <ghargoil> is it possible to uhh... take a long text string... in a span, and make it display only the first part?
[22:13:34] <popof_> back in the box you
[22:13:44] <ghargoil> or is that just crazy talk?
[22:13:45] <popof_> ghargoil: uh huh
[22:13:52] <coldhead> ghargoil: text-overflow: ellipsis
[22:13:58] <coldhead> but it needs a bunch of other stuff too
[22:14:05] <coldhead> and it doesn't work everywhere
[22:14:14] <ghargoil> I just need it to work in webkit
[22:14:19] <ghargoil> but, lemme look
[22:14:20] <ghargoil> :D
[22:14:20] <popof_> ghargoil: just constrain by dimensions (width / height) and use text-overflow
[22:14:29] <obert_> span {display:block;overflow: hidden;}
[22:14:32] <coldhead> it works in webkit
[22:14:41] <coldhead> how'd you dodge IE support?
[22:14:50] <ghargoil> its embedded in QT
[22:14:54] <ghargoil> which uses webkit :p
[22:15:03] <ghargoil> also, who uses IE anymore?
[22:15:09] <ghargoil> I almost feel bad, cause now Chrome is #1 :(
[22:15:13] <obert_> windows users
[22:15:15] <coldhead> oh right, that thing
[22:15:18] <ghargoil> beating FF
[22:15:46] <obert_> opera rules
[22:15:56] <coldhead> free software for free spirits
[22:16:26] <obert_> and free hotheads
[22:16:33] <ghargoil> obert_, popof_ -- thanks-- but now it makes a newline?
[22:16:40] <popof_> ghargoil: wut
[22:16:47] <popof_> ghargoil: put it up on jsfiddle.com
[22:16:48] <obert_> heh
[22:16:54] <obert_> tinkerbin!
[22:17:00] <ghargoil> hold on :p
[22:17:02] <tw2113> my browsers in the order that i root for them
[22:17:05] <coldhead> can you do text-overflow: ellipsis with display:inline-block ?
[22:17:08] <ghargoil> lemme just try elipsis real quick
[22:17:16] <tw2113> Firefox > Opera > IE > Chrome
[22:17:25] <ghargoil> oh, inline block works nicely
[22:17:28] <coldhead> you are a strange fellow michael
[22:17:35] <tw2113> deep down, i want IE to come back to some greatness
[22:17:45] <tw2113> and i want Opera to get 5% market share
[22:17:48] <ghargoil> tw2113: I'm not too sure on IE > Chrome, but yeah, otherwise :p
[22:18:00] <ghargoil> actually, I really *really* like Mozilla Nightly
[22:18:08] <coldhead> "except for the highly controversial and weird thing you said i agree with you"
[22:18:22] <ghargoil> coldhead: yeah, pretty much :D
[22:18:31] <tw2113> i've heard decent about IE10
[22:18:39] <tw2113> they're still in catchup mode though
[22:18:42] <ghargoil> yeah
[22:18:50] <ghargoil> I almost feel like Microsoft is better off putting their weight behind Firefox
[22:18:58] <tw2113> haha, they won't
[22:19:07] <tw2113> that's like Apple supporting something besides Safari
[22:19:10] <ghargoil> yeah, but it almost seems like a better play.
[22:19:14] <nightfly> Yeah, with the new metro apps they need their own engine.
[22:19:19] <coldhead> they're too proud
[22:19:24] <ghargoil> ah, yeah, metro
[22:19:26] <macinchik> it'll never happen
[22:19:34] <ghargoil> I think I might ... *might* enjoy metro :p
[22:19:40] <coldhead> also MS say that free software is like a cancer or AIDS or gypsies or something
[22:19:42] <ghargoil> but not there yet.
[22:19:45] <ghargoil> lol
[22:19:56] <ghargoil> I think microsoft is a bit more pragmatic than that
[22:20:03] <b1lly> gimme bugs
[22:20:06] <ghargoil> hehe
[22:20:13] <b1lly> i wanna build something
[22:20:16] <b1lly> does anyone have an open source project
[22:20:18] <b1lly> or idea
[22:20:19] <coldhead> "we used some GPL code and suddenly these gypsies were dumping burnt mattresses on our lawns"
[22:20:29] <obert_> ghargoil: http://www.webdevout.net/test?01J for example
[22:20:39] <coldhead> b1lly: touch support ? http://coldhead.github.com/kaleidos/ :D
[22:21:36] <b1lly> it shud be touch and drag
[22:21:37] <b1lly> right
[22:21:50] <coldhead> something like that
[22:21:56] <b1lly> that your project?
[22:21:57] <hariom> But on a click event on a set of classes associates respective DOM elements, I am showing a flash msg. Is there any way to deselect a particular class so when click occurs, there is no flash msg for that?
[22:21:58] <coldhead> i don't know anything about touch stuff
[22:21:59] <coldhead> yes
[22:22:12] <b1lly> look @ u
[22:22:13] <systemfault> coldhead: Cute, looks like butterfly wings.
[22:22:15] <ghargoil> sorry was looking away
[22:22:17] <ghargoil> reading up
[22:22:22] <hariom> Something like we have negation or '-' for not including a keyword in search engine search
[22:22:23] <coldhead> well spotted, systemfault
[22:22:42] <coldhead> ?:not @ hariom
[22:22:43] <bot-t> hariom, :not(selector): Selects all elements that do not match the given selector. http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[22:22:56] <ghargoil>  coldhead: cool
[22:23:00] <hariom> coldhead: ok, looking at it
[22:24:03] <ghargoil> obert_: maybe... hold on :p
[22:26:23] <ghargoil> obert_: I got it! but... now I have a different problem :D
[22:26:25] <b1lly> cold I just followed j00
[22:26:54] <ghargoil> so how do I make a horizontal scroll bar appear when the document window gets too small horizontally?
[22:26:57] <ghargoil> I dont want the text to wrap
[22:27:33] <b1lly> overflow-x: scroll ?
[22:27:48] <b1lly> erro
[22:27:52] <b1lly> overflow-x: auto
[22:30:06] <ghargoil> ok, thanks
[22:30:30] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's all take 5
[22:36:40] <coldhead> alright back to work everyone

[22:43:51] * coldhead thumps b-ot 
[22:47:50] <hesperaux> if I submit an ajax request, how do I use parts of the response in a callback? I want to show "operation succeeded/failed"
[22:48:12] <systemfault> parts of the response?
[22:48:42] <systemfault> Normally, you would use HTTP codes for that purpose with an optional body for details.
[22:50:06] <hesperaux> hmm
[22:50:45] <hesperaux> if the web server responded with some JSON, could i use that in my callback? if so, how can I access it?
[22:51:14] <systemfault> hesperaux: The response is passed to the .done handler
[22:51:54] <coldhead> .done(function (json_stuff) { if (json_stuff.status === 'success or whatever') { ... }
[22:51:58] <systemfault> var myAjaxTransaction = $.ajax(configurationHere); myAjaxTransaction.done(function(responseHere) { useResponse(responseHere); });
[22:52:21] <hesperaux> awesome
[22:52:24] * hesperaux tries it
[22:53:06] <coldhead> good luck babe
[22:57:12] <raj> coldhead, are you hitting on clients again?
[22:57:29] <hesperaux> is coldhead my g/f? otherwise, i'm not interested :)
[22:58:01] <raj> you should be so lucky
[22:58:22] <raj> guys here flock for coldhead's attention
[22:58:29] <raj> from all over the world
[22:59:15] <raj> his wit, his jq know-how, his whois
[22:59:43] <raj> he is a God among nerd
[22:59:46] <raj> *nerds
[23:00:03] <tw2113> he's the scum of the earth
[23:00:15] <coldhead> amen, preacherman
[23:00:19] <coldhead> and on that bombshell
[23:00:20] <raj> tw2113, don't you use his words against him!
[23:01:04] <tw2113> man, he left
[23:01:08] <raj> i know
[23:01:09] <tw2113> i had a good followup line
[23:01:11] <raj> i was just getting started
[23:01:28] <raj> oooh, nice, what was it?
[23:01:29] <tw2113> something about dried vomit on shoes being better looking and more motivated
[23:02:03] <raj> I dunno, I like being encouraging when he's been so helpful the past few days
[23:02:18] <raj> otherwise it's just a buncha wise-cracks
[23:02:30] <raj> positive reinforcement is what I was doing
[23:03:55] <tw2113> he knows i just tease
[23:03:58] <tw2113> in all seriousness
[23:07:08] <hesperaux> it worked!
[23:07:10] <hesperaux> thanks guys
[23:21:31] <Hermiene> What's the recommended way of doing event handling?
[23:21:42] <Hermiene> .on(), .live(), or .delegate(), or something else?
[23:22:36] <Hermiene> I'm using .click() now, and it doesn't work for generated content (or at least I /think/ that's the problem).
[23:25:59] <jrockjiggz> Hermiene: use on().
[23:26:46] <jrockjiggz> Hermiene: you are correct that when you bind using .click() it will bind to current elements in the DOM and does not account for elements that may appear in the future.
[23:27:18] <jrockjiggz> .on() is a hybrid of click() and live() and delegate().. when used correctly on() and off() is all you need
[23:27:27] <Hermiene> Ah, alright.
[23:27:33] <Hermiene> Thanks a lot. *rewriting...*
[23:28:24] <jrockjiggz> sure
[23:29:56] <Coderah> hey guys, i'm using the latest jquery-ui to toggle an element's visibility (using the blind effect through the ".toggle" method), during the animation it appears to override the font-size css property for no apparent reason, it returns to normal after the animation.
[23:30:48] <Hermiene> jrockjiggz: Hmmm, doesn't seem to work.
[23:31:01] <Coderah> actually.. it looks like it removes all of the css properties on the element (padding, font-weight, and font-size)
[23:31:09] <Hermiene> I'm using .empty() and .append() to add new content, though; should I be using something else...?
[23:31:44] <systemfault> Hermiene: .on is a do it all event handling function…. the catch is that it has two forms.
[23:32:13] <kerozene> Hermiene: to update the content fully? .html()
[23:32:17] <systemfault> $(selector).on('click', handler) is like using .click
[23:33:02] <jrockjiggz> $(container).on('click',selector,handler) is like using .live
[23:33:12] <systemfault> Right :D
[23:33:46] <Hermiene> Ok, so the selector there would be selecting within the context of container?
[23:33:49] <jrockjiggz> ;0
[23:34:19] <systemfault> Hermiene: container is a common parent element of the selector… it could be "document"
[23:34:22] <jrockjiggz> yes, considering the container is static and doesnt get replaced
[23:35:34] <Hermiene> Maybe I can save myself a lot of trouble... What I'm doing is I'm making a pagination thingy within tabs (using jQuery easy UI), but maybe there already is such a thing?
[23:35:47] <Hermiene> I tried googling some days ago, but found nothing.
[23:36:27] <Hermiene> So I have a <ul> which I go .empty() on, and then .append() the next page of <li>s to it, which all need to have click handlers on them.
[23:37:07] <jrockjiggz> use html() instead of empty().append()
[23:37:48] <jrockjiggz> and you can $('ul').on('click','li', function(){ /**/ });
[23:38:30] <jrockjiggz> im not too big on jquery ui, wouldnt be much help
[23:39:38] <Hermiene> jrockjiggz: Doesn't work even with .html() :-/
[23:40:22] <Hermiene> Oh wait, I think I see what's happening.
[23:40:33] <Hermiene> Easy UI is doing some funky things to the DOM
[23:41:19] <jrockjiggz> ?html
[23:41:20] <bot-t> .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[23:41:36] <jrockjiggz> ?replaceWith
[23:41:37] <bot-t> .replaceWith(newContent): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[23:44:56] <jrockjiggz> bot-t ;p
[23:45:52] <Coderah> anyone have any clue why ".toggle('blind')" would cause all css properties to be removed until the animation is over?!
