[00:06:57] <djam90> Guys - if sending some form data via AJAX, how do you handle an empty field? I have "Other Comments" and it can be empty, don't know whether to send to server just $('.comments').val() or check if any text and if not, send null, or what?
[00:13:42] <Cork> djam90: just use .serialize or .serializeArray and send that
[00:15:17] <kinesis> I want to $("").each every img within a post containing "single_post" identified by .single_post, .single_page in my .css file
[00:15:29] <kinesis> every img within those div class
[00:16:05] <Cork> $(parent).find('img:not(.single_post)')
[00:16:46] <kinesis> i want to do .each for each img inside div class .single_post, .single_page (from .css file)
[00:16:55] <kinesis> i want to resize the image by scaling it down..
[00:17:19] <Cork> uh
[00:17:19] <kinesis> This is for the mobile version of my site, where the image will extend past the screen if not cut down to size for the screen.
[00:17:29] <Cork> kinesis: => #css
[00:18:22] <djam90> Cork is that how you generally send form data via AJAX? I ususally create a JS object and send that
[00:18:38] <Cork> djam90: yes
[00:18:52] <Cork> that is explicitly why those functions exist
[00:18:56] <kinesis> So you can dynamically scale a image down to fit in a div
[00:19:00] <kinesis> all with CSS
[00:19:07] <kinesis> like height / width proportionate
[00:19:12] <Cork> => #css
[00:21:25] <djam90> Cork, I am confused. I have always done it using a normal JS object and never serialized the data. Does this apply to POST and GET?
[00:21:35] <Cork> both
[00:21:58] <Cork> djam90: those functions basically do the same thing, it just reduces the code duplication
[00:23:00] <djam90> Cork I don't get why it is code duplication. For instance, var data = { x: 100, y: 200 } and then in the AJAX request data: data, why serialize?
[00:23:26] <Cork> djam90: $.ajax(url, { data: $(form).serialize() });
[00:23:56] <Cork> it means you don't do each element selection and then .val()
[00:24:03] <Cork> so ya, it reduces code duplication
[00:24:12] <djam90> ahhhh!!!!!!! I see !
[00:24:14] <Cork> as it also handles hidden fields
[00:24:19] <Cork> and disabled fields
[00:24:36] <Cork> and duplicate fields with the same name
[00:24:40] <Cork> and so on
[00:25:32] <djam90> ok let me re-phrase my question and remove the word "form". My AJAX request is sending data that I have generated in Arrays. One of the values in my data to send is from a text field, which could be empty. How would you handle that?
[00:26:05] <Cork> ...
[00:26:14] <Cork> djam90: the answer still stands
[00:26:22] <Cork> if you plan to grab fields use serialize
[00:26:38] <Cork> and if you plan to append extra values use serializeArray
[00:28:27] <djam90> hmm, the data I am sending is quite specific and does not come directly from the form. For example, I am using data-id from my form checkboxes to get a specific value (as the value is the price but the data-id is the id)
[00:31:55] <djam90> Cork, this is how I am currently doing it: http://pastebin.com/7hA81HTS
[00:32:42] <djam90> so I grab the data-id from any checked checkboxes into an array. Then the chosen delivery radio value. Then the other comments textbox value
[00:58:50] <zagaza> hi! if I have a parent div containing a text.. and I have 3 other  divs containing different text.. what's the best way to update the parent div's text to the clicked other  div's text if I click on one of the other divs? http://jsfiddle.net/wg4mmz7b/
[01:02:20] <sahbeewah> zagaza: how many ways do you know to do this
[01:02:28] <zagaza> not one
[01:05:11] <zagaza> what made you ask sahbeewah?
[01:06:13] <sahbeewah> because you asked what the best way is - i’m not sure if you have no idea, or know many ways and are trying to micro-optimize to save milliseconds
[01:06:42] <sahbeewah> well to start, you should read up on what an event handler is, and specifically, what a click event handler is. and then google about what the .html()/.text() methods do, then you should have a good idea
[01:08:17] <zagaza> cool thanks

[01:23:46] <Cork> anyone feels this hit the mark? :D
[01:25:02] <mooncup> yes Cork
[01:25:08] <Cork> :D
[01:25:10] <mooncup> also somehow safari is my default svg veiwer
[01:25:25] <mooncup> and when I say safari I mean the windows one that hasn't been updated in like 2 years
[01:25:37] <javieresteban__> GUYS
[01:25:53] <mooncup> commitstrip is actually pretty good
[01:25:56] <javieresteban__> I have a gift for you :D
[01:26:02] <mooncup> they have a fair few comics I can symapthise with
[01:27:53] <kinesis> Why would the results of $("iframe.fancybox-iframe").height($(this).contents().find("body").height() differ from the actual height of the body in the DOM
[01:28:03] <kinesis> (of the iframe)..**
[01:28:04] <javieresteban__> http://pastebin.com/8iqk4aWa
[01:28:09] <javieresteban__> if you use KiwiIRC
[01:28:35] <Cork> kinesis: cause height is the viewport size of the body
[01:28:40] <Cork> not the overflow height
[01:29:06] <kinesis> Oh
[01:29:16] <javieresteban__> KiwiIRC Flooding EASY http://pastebin.com/8iqk4aWa
[01:29:20] <javieresteban__> With JQUERY
[01:29:30] <kinesis> So use something else then?
[01:29:38] <kinesis> i tried .css too.. I can try again though
[01:29:51] <Cork> scrollHeight gives you how much area you can scroll
[01:29:53] <kinesis> Oh, nvm (sorry confused functions)
[01:30:00] <Cork> if you then add height to that
[01:30:07] <Cork> you get the full height of the content
[01:30:30] <kinesis> so height + scrollHeight
[01:31:00] <Cork> might be outerHeight, not sure
[01:31:27] <Cork> if the result of height + scrollHeight is off by what looks like the padding of body
[01:31:32] <Cork> then you want outerHeight
[01:31:52] <javieresteban__> Guys, my gift for you http://pastebin.com/8iqk4aWa KiwiIRC Send Massive PRIVATE MESSAGE ( Web IRC Client )
[01:32:49] <kinesis> it worked with height  + outerHeight.. Thanks I would have never figured that out
[01:32:54] <Cork> javieresteban__: please stop spaming
[01:33:08] <javieresteban__> Cork this is only a gift :( sorry
[01:33:15] <Cork> javieresteban__: or i will have you kicked from the network
[01:33:28] <javieresteban__> okay, sorry Cork ;)
[01:33:44] <Uhkis> Cork: lol @ visual studio pic
[01:34:00] <Uhkis> yet another reason to avoid ms products ;)
[01:34:04] <Cork> :)
[01:34:15] <Cork> havne't used visual studio in many years
[01:34:33] <Cork> but i soooo recognized that feeling from back then
[01:34:41] <javieresteban__> this is jquery or visual studio channel ?
[01:34:59] <javieresteban__> cork i will have you kick from the network
[01:35:03] <Erwat> hey when writing a test that clicks a button and then tries to find out whether the button press landed it on the right page I can check a value, but the page change is animated so it doesn't happen instantly. Is using a timeout fine for testing?
[01:35:06] <Cork> ...
[01:35:07] <javieresteban__> please talk about jquery ;)
[01:35:10] <javieresteban__> jajajajaajjajajaja
[01:35:12] <javieresteban__> kidding
[01:35:32] <Uhkis> .
[01:36:28] <Uhkis> Cork: always had ssd when i've had vs installed so it's not that bad
[01:38:30] <Cork> Uhkis: well it was more the "uh you bound this file extension too?!?"
[01:38:31] <kinesis> If it is outerHeight cork does that mean my body padding is bloated orsomething is up with CSS? Because I need to trim these modals down they are long
[01:38:41] <Cork> and this predates ssd :)
[01:39:26] <Cork> kinesis: my comment about height vs outerHeight is that i'm not sure how it works for the top most element in a document
[01:39:34] <Cork> i rarely fiddle with iframes
[01:44:43] <Erwat> why are iframes so terrible
[01:45:01] <Cork> they aren't
[01:45:06] <Cork> if you load third party sites
[01:45:09] <Cork> they WAS though
[01:45:32] <Cork> scrolling lagged the content of the iframe behind
[01:45:44] <Cork> and dragging things above wasn't possible
[01:45:48] <Cork> and... so on
[01:53:40] <quyen> Hi
[01:54:01] <quyen> I have question, Who are there?
[01:54:35] <quyen> I using jquery 210. I cant used trigger
[01:55:11] <xec> ?demo @ quyen
[01:55:12] <b-ot> quyen: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:03:07] <disorder> hello people, I need help with my assignment.. the thing is, I want to have a click2clone something function that does basically this: I click on a div from the list (f.e. checkbox) and paste it to the second div by clicking, cloning the first clicked div into second one.. I have a jsfiddle link but it ain't doing anything because I have external variables linked but it could show you what I'm trying to do (I don't want to spam the channel with cp)
[02:03:22] <disorder> http://jsfiddle.net/0qo8qw0d/ so if anyone has any ideas, I'm open :)
[02:27:53] <djam90> Cork, I just realised something critical. I was trying to do an AJAX request instead of submitting a form so it takes me to the next page!
[02:32:21] <Silmarilion> I am returning this partial for my jqm app https://gist.github.com/anonymous/545053385e0cb70d3bc5 when I need to redirect to a page with ajax. The problem is that it doesn't work for some reason only in Firefox, instead of redirect the dom is hidden. Any clues?
[02:42:36] <djam90> How would I add additional data to a form submit?
[02:43:02] <djam90> I can do it in AJAX but I need it to do the traditional form submit and goto next page
[02:45:22] <ilhami> djam90 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2530635/jquery-add-additional-parameters-on-submit-not-ajax
[02:46:05] <djam90> ilhami, there must be a better way. I am appending an array of data and some strings. In AJAX I would just send an object
[02:46:38] <ilhami> well a better way, I don't know.
[02:54:04] <flam_> hi, how can i use once() with dynamic/live elements
[02:54:18] <djam90> I can't add extra inputs like that, I just can't. This is my current code: http://pastebin.com/Sp2FrKdL  I could do with passing through the data object as I don't want to use the values of checkboxes I am using data-id
[02:54:40] <flam_> something like $('body').on('click','.some-class',function() ...   but using once
[02:55:27] <sacho> do that and have .off() in the handler
[02:57:03] <djam90> I'm really struggling with adding an array of data to a form and submitting it
[02:57:59] <Cork> flam_: you can't
[02:58:39] <Cork> flam_: as delicated event handlers is for multiple elements it can't do what you asked for
[02:59:06] <Cork> flam_: the simplest way to do something like it might be to add a value with .data() on the element when the handler fires
[02:59:12] <Cork> and if the value is set don't do anything
[03:00:27] <flam_> well the thing is that for some reason drupal's retarded ajax forms make my event handlers execute multiple times, almost all of them have to be defined using $('parent-element').on('click','child-element',function() ... because the page is updated from the server
[03:01:26] <flam_> so i must somehow make it so that they aren't executed multiple times in a row
[03:01:41] <Cork> flam_: on('click', function() { if(!$(this).data('once')) { /* do your thing */ $(this).data('once', true'); } })
[03:02:01] <flam_> ok, i'll try that
[03:03:14] <jop008> From the server I got this string "AndrÃ©a TÃ¼rel" how to unescape this?
[03:05:15] <jop008> This "AndrÃ©a TÃ¼rel" must become Andréa Türel
[03:07:58] <jop008> decodeURIComponent(escape(cfield))
[03:09:10] <Cork> jop008: looks like the server sends the response with a none utf encoding
[03:09:26] <Cork> jop008: the by far simplest solution is to have the server send utf8
[03:09:48] <Cork> (you should always use utf8 for websites, both client side and server side)
[03:22:34] <djam90> Can I use .serializeArray() and add data to it and then submit that data as the form?
[03:23:07] <mooncup> yep
[03:24:39] <djam90> mooncup, how do I submit the form with the serializeArray().concat(myData) ?
[03:26:45] <djam90> I have my data in an Array. I use $(form).serializeArray() and then add my data in to it. How do I then submit this data as the normal form submission (NOT AN AJAX REQ)
[03:28:22] <Cork> djam90: you don't if you want to add data to a normal form submission you have to store the data as hidden fields in the form
[03:28:24] <djam90> I honestly can't figure this one out. All examples on the web show submitting the form data using AJAX and staying on the page
[03:28:41] <djam90> Cork I can't add it to hidden fields as I am only submitting CHECKED items
[03:28:55] <Cork> djam90: then you can't use normal form submission
[03:29:19] <Cork> though i don't understand why you feel you have to overcomplicate things like this
[03:29:34] <Cork> what you try to do client side is normally done server side
[03:29:57] <djam90> Cork I need to submit the form using normal form submission, via POST. I need to send the checked checkboxes, but I need their data-id attribute not their value
[03:30:15] <Cork> djam90: or just simply set disabled on the fields related to the checkbox when it isn't checked
[03:30:39] <Cork> djam90: so put the data-id value as value on the checkbox
[03:30:43] <Cork> and you would get what you want
[03:30:58] <djam90> I need the value to be the price though
[03:31:02] <Cork> <input type="checkbox" name="something" value="the id">
[03:31:06] <Cork> ok?
[03:31:12] <mooncup> what
[03:31:15] <Cork> not sure why that would matter
[03:31:23] <mooncup> >but I need their data-id attribute not their value
[03:31:27] <mooncup> why?
[03:31:29] <Cork> ya
[03:32:26] <djam90> mooncup because this is an online service booking form. And the value is their price, and the data-id is the service's ID so I can use it on the server in the next stage
[03:32:57] <Cork> djam90: so have the price as a hidden field
[03:33:04] <Cork> and the service id as a value on the checkbox
[03:33:15] <Cork> if the service id is missing ignore the price value
[03:33:24] <sahbeewah> djam90: you wouldn’t get the data-id if you submitted it through a standard form submit
[03:33:27] <Cork> also, you should prob not have the value be sent from the client
[03:33:41] <Cork> cause the user might fiddle with it
[03:33:43] <djam90> I am not sending the price through the form, just the ID
[03:33:49] <Cork> ...
[03:33:54] <djam90> guess I should switch them round
[03:33:55] <Cork> so just have the id as the checkbox value
[03:33:58] <djam90> yeah
[03:34:00] <mooncup> 12:33 < djam90> guess I should switch them round
[03:34:02] * mooncup claps
[03:34:21] <djam90> i think my brain sometimes thinks "i could switch them round but that is extra work"
[03:34:25] <djam90> need to slap myself
[03:34:34] <djam90> I have switched them and it works
[03:39:36] <djam90> thanks for the help guys and sorry I was not taking on board the advice straight away
[03:39:53] <djam90> I do have a tendency of over complicating things although I do make an effort to keep things simple
[03:44:29] <granden> Hi, anyone where who have some extensive experience with google maps?
[03:44:58] <granden> I would like to cerate a map with a autocomplete search field (so far successfull) but I also want to map up multiple markers on that map. And I dont know how to do that.
[03:47:57] <sahbeewah> i don’t think the google maps api docs gets any more straightforward, which part don’t you understand?
[03:51:58] <granden> sahbeewah: How to add multiple markers, I got my first code from google docs
[03:55:04] <sahbeewah> you get the section of your code that adds one marker, then you repeat that code …?
[03:57:35] <granden> sahbeewah: Yeah but if I'm going to add multiple markers with infowindows
[03:57:53] <granden> or if there is a api way to make it a link directly otherwise infowindows
[04:02:50] <sahbeewah> granden: can’t see the issue, you should post your code and what you’ve tried because you’re not making sense
[04:03:39] <granden> sahbeewah: Ok, I will do that
[04:30:51] <crazee> jqueryers! Question about ajax posting gzipped data
[04:31:23] <crazee> I can do it with curl: curl -XPOST -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" -H "Content-Encoding: gzip" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @Household.json.gz --compressed http://foo.couchappy.com/foo
[04:31:43] <crazee> But with jquery it is failing: http://pastie.org/9714192
[04:32:35] <crazee> The headers sent don't seem to match
[04:38:03] <Cork> crazee: as far as i know there isn't support for requesting the browser to gzip encode the data before submitting
[04:40:59] <zagaza> I know this is wrong.. but how do I select "this .child" ?  var str = $('.child').this.text();
[04:41:45] <Cork> zagaza: $(this).find('.child).text()
[04:41:57] <zagaza> thanks!
[04:42:20] <Cork> crazee: actually, correction the server announces if it allowed gzipped posts
[04:42:33] <Cork> crazee: and the browser does the compression automatically if it is
[04:42:55] <zagaza> hm cork weird didn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/wg4mmz7b/7/
[04:43:05] <zagaza> it doesn't update the string in the first box when u click one of the 3 childs
[04:43:20] <Cork> uh
[04:43:45] <Cork> they aren't children
[04:43:50] <Cork> they are siblings
[04:44:14] <zagaza> yeah true, but still :)
[04:44:42] <Cork> also the code doesn't make sense
[04:44:45] <Cork> you prob want this http://jsfiddle.net/wg4mmz7b/8/
[04:45:50] <zagaza> ah neat, thanks
[04:46:15] <crazee> Cork, really? When would the announcement happen?
[04:46:51] <Cork> crazee: in the post that shows the page as far as i know
[04:46:53] <zagaza> sorry but I gotta ask you one more completing newbie question, if I'd add a button to reset to the initial text, is there a way to do reset it to that?
[04:47:17] <Cork> crazee: though i've never tried this my self, but as far as i know that is how it works
[04:47:41] <Cork> zagaza: only if you saved it somewhere
[04:48:03] <zagaza> I see, thanks gonna try to figure it out
[04:49:05] <crazee> Cork, I'm not talking about compression from server to client, I'm talking about the other way around.
[04:49:13] <Cork> crazee: i know
[04:49:20] <Cork> that is what i talked about too
[04:50:25] <crazee> A client sends a request to a server, so there is no way for a server to tell the client what it can accept.
[04:50:45] <Cork> there is
[04:51:00] <Cork> if the post is to the same server you did load the page first from there
[04:51:15] <Cork> if it is a post to a different domain you have the preflight options request
[04:51:40] <Cork> but like i said, i haven't tested this my self so not completely sure this works
[04:52:41] <crazee> Sounds interesting, but I haven't seen it implemented anywhere
[04:53:08] <Cork> crazee: it should be as simple as sending the accept-encoding header on the response header
[04:53:17] <Cork> if that doesn't work then ya, not possible
[04:55:57] <crazee> Hmm, I could see how a preflight request could enable this - gzipped requests are a new feature in couchdb, I doubt they have implemented it like this, but I will check
[05:10:40] <Eckyecky> Hello, I am using this: http://www.croppic.net/ - problem is that it's not a dropzone. Is there a way to make it possible to drag and drop an image on the page without using a library such as dropzone.js ?
[05:11:45] <djam90> Why not just use Dropzone.js?
[05:12:05] <djam90> Is there a jQuery UI channel or can I talk about it here?
[05:14:44] <djam90> OK I'm gonna shoot my question anyway. I am using jQuery UI datepicker, and want to add some text into some of the fields. I did some Googling and found you can use CSS :after{ content: "text"; } but I wonder if this is the only way?
[05:15:46] <djam90> Or should I use something like http://keith-wood.name/datepick.html

[05:46:14] <dylan9o4> i dont get it
[05:48:42] <Eckyecky> let me check
[05:49:25] <Eckyecky> decx: did you use that with croppic?
[05:49:47] <decx> no
[05:50:01] <decx> the interesting part fo you i inside the loadend event
[05:50:13] <decx> this.result will be a base64 string of the iamge
[05:50:30] <decx> damn i cant write today
[05:50:50] <Eckyecky> that is a little over my jquery knowledge
[05:51:02] <Eckyecky> not sure how that listener works
[05:51:05] <decx> well there is no jquery :>
[05:51:22] <giuseppesolinas> does anybody use jquery fullcalendar?
[05:51:31] <Eckyecky> Mind if I send you a pm?
[05:51:37] <Eckyecky> want to offer something
[05:51:56] <decx> no thanks
[05:52:00] <decx> keep it in the channel
[05:54:49] <Eckyecky> sure
[05:55:33] <Omar-> gabriel_schulhof on beforechange event when you want to alter .toPage value when it's an object, it works only on first run of the framework. Later on, if you want to alter it, it works only when .toPage is a string. Is that normal?
[05:55:37] <Eckyecky> are you interested in making a script on jsfiddle to make croppic work with a dragged image? I can pay for it.
[05:55:59] <Eckyecky> I'm a little short on time to digg into this atm
[06:04:51] <decx> i'm busy myself and croppic doesnt look that grand to raise my curiosity ^^
[06:08:49] <Eckyecky> ok
[06:08:53] <Eckyecky> no problem
[06:09:44] <giuseppesolinas> does anybody use jquery fullcalendar? I'm getting all-day events if I render the event via ajax success callback with the exact same data
[06:25:23] <MikeD_> any suggestion for a simple clock/timer?  I'd like to count up since a reference datetime - i think what I'm looking for is so simple I should write it myself, eh?
[06:26:57] <MikeD_> jquery plugins tag clock and timer have a lot of options, I am hoping someone here has already done the investigation and wants to share
[06:29:17] <giuseppesolinas> how do I force a json boolean to be sent as boolean?
[06:29:42] <giuseppesolinas> I keep getting true because ajax sends 'false'
[06:29:55] <MikeD_> json is a string encoding - are you using a proper deserializer?
[06:30:16] <giuseppesolinas> MikeD_,  ehat do you mean?
[06:30:22] <giuseppesolinas> what
[06:30:34] <MikeD_> how are you turning the string back into an object?
[06:31:17] <giuseppesolinas> I've tried to JSON.parse before sending but no luck
[06:32:07] <giuseppesolinas> MikeD_, for all I know it's always an object
[06:32:22] <lolmaus> I need to filter a jQuery collection by two data attributes, e. g. `data-foo` and `data-bar`. I struggle to compose an appropriate selector for `$elements.filter()`.
[06:36:31] <giuseppesolinas> json boolean anyone?
[06:37:22] <carlton> DON'T PLAY WITH MY HEART
[06:37:42] <decx> lolmaus return $(this).data('foo') && $(this).data('bar') should do it
[06:41:23] <MikeD_> is there much difference between $('<span>').data('foo','bar'); and $('<span data-foo="bar">);
[06:41:46] <decx> the first one wont have the attribute in the markup
[06:42:00] <decx> but that isnt needed in most cases
[06:43:05] <MikeD_> is the .data() method 'better' in some sense of implementation agnostic vs knowing too much about how html uses data-* attributes ?
[06:45:12] <decx> when you do the second one and then later do .data('bar') it'll just create the cached dataset which would have been done from the start if you used data() directly
[06:46:31] <MikeD_> k thanks, I'll consistently use .data() directly then
[06:46:46] <decx> unless you want to use the native dataset yes
[06:46:54] <decx> ie console.log($('<span data-foo="bar">')[0].dataset, $('<span>').data('foo','bar')[0].dataset)
[06:48:04] <decx> thanks to the caching data() is pretty fast so native might not be needed even in performance depending situations
[06:48:54] <MikeD_> if performance is ever an issue, we'll have a thousand other optimizations to consider first  :)
[06:49:28] <decx> just another thing to consider if you use dataset anywhere
[06:50:30] <MikeD_> i feel like if you're going to use jquery at all, you might as well just depend on it
[07:05:52] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone! are there some smart jquery souls around here?
[07:05:58] <MikeD_> no
[07:05:58] <cjohnson> don't ask to ask
[07:05:59] <cjohnson> just ask
[07:06:01] <jarr0dsz> i try to tackle a fade prblem but havent been able to combine some examples
[07:06:11] <jarr0dsz> http://jsfiddle.net/zmehqcLb/ i try to fade in and fade out a div on scrolll
[07:06:27] <jarr0dsz> like on https://www.careerdean.com/?section=ama
[07:06:40] <cjohnson> what is your problem exactly?
[07:06:44] <jarr0dsz> but i have a basic fadein of jquery that is very short,  i want that long fading mechanism on that site but unable to get that
[07:06:49] <cjohnson> and/or add your HTML, right now this isn't a functioning fiddle
[07:06:52] <Nhuy> How can I to do a $(this) with the $(event.target) way?
[07:07:02] <cjohnson> Nhuy: hrm? what do you mean
[07:07:18] <jarr0dsz> so using the page location to determine the opacity somehow
[07:07:36] <Nhuy> <a onclick='my_function(event)'>click</a>
[07:07:51] <Nhuy> function my_function(event){...}
[07:07:55] <cjohnson> jarr0dsz: set the opacity CSS property based on the scroll position
[07:08:15] <jarr0dsz> cjohnson yes i also tried that the problem is i want to begin with transparant then fade into white ( for a top header )
[07:08:16] <cjohnson> you can use .css() to change the CSS properties and .scrollTop() to get the current scroll position
[07:08:18] <Nhuy> for get the events of that function I must to do some like $(event.target).html8);
[07:08:26] <Nhuy> for example for the html of that tag
[07:08:38] <Nhuy> but the $(this)how will be?
[07:08:39] <cjohnson> jarr0dsz: okay, so what is the problem?
[07:08:43] <jarr0dsz> cjohnson thank you yes in my jsfiddle im using that code to determine the position of the scroll
[07:08:46] <cjohnson> fade from 0 opacity to 100
[07:08:49] <jarr0dsz> my example is "to fast "
[07:09:02] <cjohnson> all you're doing is a toggle
[07:09:04] <jarr0dsz> if you scroll up and down its like 1 cm because im using a position of from 400 then use regular fade in
[07:09:12] <jarr0dsz> it should use the position of the screen instead, somehow
[07:09:17] <jarr0dsz> then it would become way more smooth
[07:09:22] <cjohnson> the "somehow" is how I just suggested ;)
[07:09:29] <cjohnson> using the css opacity property calculated based on scroll position
[07:10:41] <jarr0dsz> let me create a full jsfiddle with html and css to demonstrate
[07:10:48] <cjohnson> if you prefer
[07:10:58] <cjohnson> I get what you're saying
[07:11:02] <cjohnson> the site you linked demonstrates it
[07:11:11] <cjohnson> now you just have to try it
[07:13:37] <jarr0dsz> cjohnson http://jsfiddle.net/zmehqcLb/2/ like that
[07:13:46] <jarr0dsz> if you scroll down there is very small moment it fades in the header to black
[07:13:50] <cjohnson> right
[07:13:54] <cjohnson> so now, again, try what I suggested
[07:13:55] <jarr0dsz> i want more smooth based on the window location but no clue how ;p
[07:13:57] <cjohnson> stop using .fadeIn
[07:14:03] <cjohnson> set the css opacity based on the scroll position
[07:14:32] <jarr0dsz> could you give a headstart? im not quite sure how to approach that
[07:14:44] <jarr0dsz> using the scroll function again then get the position somehow
[07:14:46] <cjohnson> which part are you not sure about?
[07:14:53] <cjohnson> $(window).scrollTop() gives you current scroll position
[07:15:05] <cjohnson> $(element).css('opacity', number) lets you set the opacity to a certain number
[07:15:41] <lolmaus> I've got an <img> with the `src` attribute poiting at a non-existent location. The image is initially hidden. I receive an event that indicates that there's now a valid image at that location. How do i make the browser redownload the image?
[07:16:34] <cjohnson> lolmaus: try re-setting the src
[07:17:14] <jarr0dsz> ok reading the docs im getting something like scrollTop()
[07:17:20] <jarr0dsz> excuse http://jsfiddle.net/zmehqcLb/3/
[07:17:30] <jarr0dsz> but that does not quite work yet
[07:17:49] <cjohnson> scrollTop() is not a function
[07:17:55] <cjohnson> read what I wrote
[07:18:02] <cjohnson> I said $(window).scrollTop(), not scrollTop()
[07:18:55] <cjohnson> jarr0dsz: the next step is turning the scroll position into a percentage
[07:19:12] <cjohnson> jarr0dsz: you can do that by picking the height where you want it to be 0% opacity and divide that by the scroll position
[07:19:33] <cjohnson> so let's say you want 0% opacity at 500, you calculate opacity by doing 500 / $(window).scrollTop()
[07:19:45] <cjohnson> actually that would go from 0 to 100%, if you want it to fade out instead of in, you would want
[07:19:55] <cjohnson> 1 - ( 500 / $(window).scrollTop() )
[07:20:32] <cjohnson> sorry.... scrollTop / 500. not 500 / scrollTop
[07:21:00] <jarr0dsz> okay thank you not much of a jquery guru getting like http://jsfiddle.net/zmehqcLb/6/
[07:21:14] <djam90> Guys I have such a weird problem and I can't fix it :(  I am using this lib: http://keith-wood.name/datepickRef.html  and I am using this code to add some text on tomorrow's field: http://pastebin.com/6k1qdktA   the date == plusOneDay won't work. They are both typeof(object) and both have length of 53 chars and they are exactly equal strings but it doesn't work!!!!!
[07:21:28] <cjohnson> jarr0dsz: yep! you're getting there. But I told you wrong, it's 500 / scroll
[07:21:29] <jarr0dsz> like so http://jsfiddle.net/zmehqcLb/7/
[07:21:32] <cjohnson> damn there I go again
[07:21:34] <cjohnson> scroll / 500
[07:21:48] <cjohnson> yep, there you go
[07:21:48] <jarr0dsz> yes modified :) but it still does not fade to black though :(
[07:21:49] <decx> are you reinventing the sticky header wheel?
[07:21:56] <jarr0dsz> not sure what i miss there then
[07:22:26] <jarr0dsz> cjohnson now i expect tho get the header to fade to black and fade out when i scroll up
[07:22:36] <cjohnson> you have no #header_background...
[07:22:41] <cjohnson> check your HTML
[07:23:07] <jarr0dsz> ah yes sharp ;p http://jsfiddle.net/zmehqcLb/8/ but no go still
[07:23:22] <cjohnson> read your HTML
[07:23:23] <jarr0dsz> or does not use use . in jquery class names
[07:23:37] <cjohnson> there is *no* reference to a header_background of any kind
[07:24:19] <jarr0dsz> http://jsfiddle.net/zmehqcLb/9/ yeah right thank you so much ;P
[07:24:28] <jarr0dsz> its actually not that bad to do in the end :)
[07:24:38] <cjohnson> nope just a one-liner really
[07:24:42] <djam90> Look, they are the same :( Thu Nov 13 2014 12:00:00 GMT+0000 (GMT Standard Time)=======Thu Nov 13 2014 12:00:00 GMT+0000 (GMT Standard Time)
[07:24:51] <cjohnson> djam90: it's a date object, not a string
[07:25:02] <cjohnson> when you try to dump it, it gets turned into a string
[07:25:04] <djam90> why does it console.log to a string?
[07:25:05] <djam90> ph
[07:25:06] <djam90> oh
[07:25:06] <djam90> ok
[07:25:16] <cjohnson> because of the .toString() method on the Date object
[07:25:19] <jarr0dsz> now the only problem i have left cjohnson is that it should fade from transparant to white
[07:25:26] <jarr0dsz> not from black to white and back, any thoughts on how to go for that
[07:25:37] <cjohnson> change your background-color to white...?
[07:27:46] <djam90> cjohnson, thanks that made it work! Any idea why the onDate callback seems to run twice?
[07:27:53] <jarr0dsz> cjohnson no that won't work since its white by default
[07:27:56] <nix_fan> How to replace jQuery(this).prop('selected', true); with .click?
[07:27:56] <jarr0dsz> http://jsfiddle.net/zmehqcLb/11/ made background red
[07:28:00] <nix_fan> it simply doesn't work
[07:28:01] <cjohnson> jarr0dsz: I'm not sure what you're asking about then?
[07:28:08] <nix_fan> with just .click()
[07:28:09] <cjohnson> nix_fan: what do you mean
[07:28:22] <jarr0dsz> cjohnson the idea is that the header div is transparant to begin with and scroll *into* white when scrolling down
[07:28:26] <nix_fan> I want to use jQuery(this).click();
[07:28:34] <nix_fan> I have the element in 'this'
[07:28:41] <nix_fan> when I console.log
[07:28:52] <cjohnson> jarr0dsz: remove the 1- bit then
[07:29:06] <cjohnson> 1 - makes it 100 to 0, without that it's 0 to 100
[07:29:07] <nix_fan> [Log] <option value=​"1545" price=​"0">​BLACK​</option>​ (sienna-dress.html, line 5034)
[07:29:23] <cjohnson> nix_fan: okay, so use jQuery(this).click()? I'm not sure what you're asking
[07:29:25] <nix_fan> I want to trigger a natural click
[07:29:40] <cjohnson> that's correct. node.click() triggers a click
[07:29:41] <cjohnson> on node
[07:29:46] <cjohnson> if this is a node, this.click() works
[07:29:55] <cjohnson> jQuery(node).click() should work as well
[07:30:21] <cjohnson> if it's not working for you, paste your relevant html and js to jsfiddle
[07:30:52] <cjohnson> djam90: I don't even see anything in your paste that says onDate
[07:30:55] <cjohnson> or what that means
[07:31:03] <jarr0dsz> ah great :) thanks you
[07:31:40] <nix_fan> strange, it doesnt work
[07:31:54] <nix_fan> This works jQuery(this).prop('selected', true);
[07:32:10] <nix_fan> but jQuery(this).click(); doesn't
[07:32:24] <nix_fan> how is it even possible, since it's in the same place
[07:32:27] <nix_fan> and same node
[07:33:09] <nix_fan> do I have to use find?
[07:33:48] <cjohnson> node.click() will fire a click event
[07:34:06] <cjohnson> if it's not working, as I said above, paste the relevant HTML and JS into jsfiddle
[07:34:12] <cjohnson> so we can see what else it is causing the issue
[07:36:50] <soahccc> Is it possible to bind to the meta key on windows? I could understand that windows search overrides but even win+p or win+o seem to be ingored even though they have no action
[07:37:25] <cjohnson> I think the meta key is a modifier
[07:37:35] <cjohnson> you might be able to detect it but only when another key is pressed
[07:37:42] <cjohnson> same with ctrl, alt, etc
[07:37:46] <cjohnson> they don't trigger keypress events themselves
[07:39:20] <spudzee> I need help with this function. For some reason this is not working: $('#MENU2').click(function(){$('#MENU3').animate({width:'+=100';left:'-=100'},100);});
[07:39:23] <nix_fan> http://pastebin.com/U0gNpc3B
[07:39:29] <nix_fan> cjohnson:
[07:40:25] <cjohnson> nix_fan: what are you expecting?
[07:40:34] <nix_fan> a click
[07:40:34] <cjohnson> click events are not how you select options in a select box
[07:40:37] <nix_fan> on a option
[07:40:38] <cjohnson> it does trigger a click.
[07:40:44] <cjohnson> the click just doesn't do what you think it should
[07:41:16] <cjohnson> spudzee: "not working" is a useless statement
[07:41:31] <nix_fan> well I am in magento configurable products, I need it to generate a natural click to enable following dropdown
[07:41:44] <nix_fan> see my conundrum?
[07:42:04] <spudzee> It's freezing my jquery code
[07:42:10] <nix_fan> what shall I use instead to generate a change/click
[07:42:14] <nix_fan> ?
[07:42:23] <spudzee> If it's 'not working' I don't really know what else to call it
[07:42:49] <spudzee> anyways... is there anything wrong with this statement; syntax wise?
[07:43:03] <cjohnson> open your console
[07:43:07] <cjohnson> read your errors
[07:43:29] <decx> spudzee animates takes an object which is separated by , not ;
[07:43:34] <decx> animate()
[07:43:36] <decx> *
[07:44:03] <cjohnson> nix_fan: I suspect it would bind to the select's change event
[07:44:03] <spudzee> okay, thanks
[07:44:13] <cjohnson> nix_fan: but you would have to confirm that is the case
[07:44:23] <cjohnson> try triggering $(this).closest('select').trigger('change')
[07:45:24] <decx> you still need to change selectedIndex
[07:46:01] <cjohnson> also the if check on line 8 is redundant I think
[07:46:07] <cjohnson> maybe not, depends what you intend
[07:46:19] <cjohnson> but the :contains already checks that the value matches
[07:46:42] <cjohnson> I would just do
[07:47:00] <cjohnson> $(this).closest('select').val( $(this).val() ).trigger('change')  probably
[07:47:05] <cjohnson> instead of messing with selectedIndex directly
[07:47:12] <cjohnson> personal preference though
[07:49:54] <decx> where's the code
[07:49:58] <ilhami> anyone here? :D
[07:50:04] <decx> found it
[07:50:36] <cjohnson> ilhami: no
[07:50:45] <decx> yeah so jsut $('select').val(this.alt.trim()).trigger('change') or not
[07:51:21] <cjohnson> why all that instead of just this.value ?
[07:51:25] <cjohnson> that should always work
[07:52:13] <decx> triggering a virtual event on a native element in cumbersome
[07:52:23] <decx> is*
[07:52:24] <cjohnson> no I mean the .val() bit
[07:52:30] <cjohnson> why this.alt.trim() instead of this.value
[07:52:39] <decx> because this is an image?
[07:52:49] <decx> and images dont have values
[07:52:54] <decx> and the code had alt
[07:52:57] <cjohnson> inside the .each, this is the option
[07:53:01] <cjohnson> no?
[07:53:09] <decx> well this one line is in img.click
[07:53:24] <decx> none of that contains kerfuffle
[07:53:32] <cjohnson> ooh I see replacing the contains entirely
[07:53:39] <nix_fan> It's ajax I think so the nearest drop down gets populated according to the one I want clicked
[07:53:42] <cjohnson> makes sense
[07:53:56] <nix_fan> damn
[07:54:04] <nix_fan> so I need to cause a proper click I guess
[07:54:09] <nix_fan> on 'this'
[07:54:35] <cjohnson> uh, no
[07:54:50] <cjohnson> again, try triggering a change event on the select
[07:55:00] <cjohnson> it really depends what the other code uses to detect the value change
[07:55:19] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/q9o3xrs5/
[07:55:28] <decx> a demo will help :p
[07:56:20] <cjohnson> I wonder, does .val() trigger a change event ?
[07:56:24] <decx> no
[07:56:41] <decx> change happens on blur
[07:57:19] <cjohnson> ah weird. hanks
[07:57:20] <cjohnson> thanks*
[07:57:44] <nix_fan> decx: it just empties both selects
[07:57:46] <nix_fan> :)
[07:59:13] <jrgcombr> Hi everyone!
[07:59:17] <nix_fan> and doesn't populate the following select
[07:59:25] * Oka waves.
[07:59:36] <nix_fan> I mean magento doesn't
[07:59:49] <cjohnson> nix_fan: well, his demo demonstrates how to select the element based on the img.alt value, and trigger a change event
[07:59:57] <cjohnson> if that's not doing it, you'll have to dig into your code
[08:00:17] <cjohnson> and/or paste the relevant bits (unlikely considering how gigantic magento is)... or maybe put your site up on a public server for us to see
[08:01:24] <nix_fan> what bugs me is that jQuery(this).prop('selected', true); does the job but click() doesn't actually cause magento to think it was clicked
[08:01:32] <nix_fan> I have to dig out what magento uses
[08:01:50] <cjohnson> that is again because magento probably isn't looking for a click event
[08:02:45] <jrgcombr> I got a problem with jquery mobile 1.4.5 with an old deive. An LG P698 / Android 2.3.4. It's does not render buttons on this device.
[08:02:54] <cjohnson> it wouldn't really make any sense to look for a click event. it would make more sense to look for a change event on the select
[08:03:37] <jrgcombr> If I try with a older jquery mobile version, it works. I've not clue where to start to find out the problem. any ideias?
[08:10:13] <decx> arschmitz you there?
[08:10:47] <decx> jrgcombr hold you thumbs that he's here because that's the jqm lead dev
[08:11:14] <bongjovi> Is it possible to have a div register mouseenter but not be clickable?
[08:15:40] <cjohnson> "not be clickable" meaning what
[08:17:38] <bongjovi> cjohnson, sorry, as in I need a top layer div to be visible but the layer underneath register mouseevents
[08:17:53] <bongjovi> and the top layer to register hover events but not click events
[08:18:13] <bongjovi> I doubt it's possible..
[08:18:25] <cjohnson> bongjovi: maybe this will help?http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6740242/click-link-below-a-higher-z-index-div
[08:18:58] <cjohnson> not sure it will help for non-anchor clicks though
[08:19:16] <decx> pointer-events: none
[08:19:20] <decx> in new browsers
[08:19:30] <decx> although that does just kill all the events
[08:19:34] <cjohnson> yeah that's what the SO link suggests
[08:19:38] <decx> ah
[08:19:39] <cjohnson> but it won't work in IE, not even 10
[08:19:40] <ghostlines> Hi, is it possible to change the content of a div that is set to display none?
[08:19:44] <ghostlines> currently I can only change the innerHTML content of div's that are displayed
[08:19:45] <cjohnson> or so it says
[08:19:48] <cjohnson> but it does link to this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5855135/css-pointer-events-property-alternative-for-ie
[08:19:57] <cjohnson> which does seem like it might be effective
[08:19:58] <BillCriswell> ghostlines: Yes, same way you would no matter the display.
[08:20:25] <decx> the rock says it doesnt matter what's visible
[08:20:42] <cjohnson> dwayne johnson?
[08:20:51] <jimi_> Can anyone recommend a method for blocking a function until a dialog is answered? i have some if control statements that run in order in a method. if one if is true, a dialog launches for yes/no. while the dialog is visible, the other if statements still run, and the result returns true, without waiting for the dialog answer.
[08:21:06] <decx> a dialog will block anything anyway
[08:21:06] <cjohnson> jimi_: confirm is synchronous
[08:21:07] <BillCriswell> THE Dwayne Johnson
[08:21:26] <jimi_> cjohnson, yeah, i had confirm, but boss didn't like it because you can't change the ok/cancel labels
[08:21:43] <cjohnson> yeah, you'll have to refactor code to run on a callback then
[08:21:52] <cjohnson> only continue once ok has been pressed
[08:21:56] <jimi_> ok ty
[08:22:08] <decx> or just start when you click your ok button in the faux dialog
[08:22:51] <jimi_> ya, I'm gonna have to do something like that
[08:23:53] <bongjovi> Thanks for the suggestions, but pointer-events: none; won't work for this unfortunately
[08:23:58] <bongjovi> as it stops mouseenter events too
[08:24:06] <cjohnson> read the rest of that link
[08:24:08] <Oka> bongjovi: Can you create a testcase so I can see what you're trying to do exactly?
[08:24:10] <cjohnson> which links to the second link I posted
[08:24:25] <cjohnson> he wants click events to trigger a z-indexed lower node but mouseover to still fire on the top node
[08:24:38] <bongjovi> Thanks, will read it
[08:24:46] <bongjovi> exactly right
[08:26:56] <cjohnson> in general I suspect the solution is somewhere along the lines of, on mousedown, hide the top layer so the click event passes to the bottom
[08:26:59] <cjohnson> if that's acceptable
[08:27:16] <cjohnson> if not you might need a third layer over top both and then proxy the click events from the top to the bottom
[08:27:42] <cjohnson> I think mouseenter vs mouseover might be useful as well
[08:29:13] <bongjovi> Yeah seems like that would be to do it
[08:29:43] <bongjovi> Basically have a canvas object that users can draw on, but I have an svg with "zones" that need to register a hover event if passed through while the user is drawing
[08:29:53] <bongjovi> (holding down the mouse)
[08:30:00] <bongjovi> whilst*
[08:30:09] <bongjovi> be the way to do it*
[08:30:11] <cjohnson> ah if the zones aren't visible I bet the hide-on-mousedown solution should be good enough
[08:30:11] <bongjovi> sorry, long day..
[08:30:28] <cjohnson> $(document).on('mousedown' that is
[08:30:29] <decx> why not have your zones in a coordinate array inside the canvas?
[08:30:48] <decx> it's just numbercrunching anyway
[08:31:00] <bongjovi> decx, that was originally how I wrote it... just switched over to mouseenter events
[08:31:09] <bongjovi> not sure why..
[08:31:21] <bongjovi> it basically iterated through every mouse event and checked if coordinates landed within each zone
[08:31:45] <bongjovi> but the only way I could think to do it was for each mouse event, iterate through every zone (there are hundreds) and check if it landed in that zone
[08:32:14] <bongjovi> but the zone coords were stored as an array on init
[08:32:35] <cjohnson> I bet you could do some clever arranging of the data so it doesn't have to actually iterate every zone
[08:33:05] <decx> you could also catch the mouseover event on your svg and use that to draw on the canvas
[08:33:05] <bongjovi> it also becomes more difficult when the zones aren't rectangular..
[08:33:19] <decx> it's just x&y anyway
[08:33:29] <cjohnson> ah...that does make things harder to do clever data shuffling
[08:33:34] <decx> you dont have to actually have events on the canvas
[08:33:46] <decx> i just used that the other day for a gimmick background canvas
[08:33:54] <bongjovi> hmm that might be the best bet
[08:37:39] <bongjovi> I mean, could I make the canvas transparent, have the svg below, and only capture mousemove events and pass them to the svg layer?
[08:37:48] <bongjovi> Or is that more complicated than the other way round?
[08:37:54] <soahccc> What is the right way to detect windows or rather mac? jQuery.browser is discontinued but feature detection is not the right thing for shortcuts, is it?
[08:38:08] <NoiseEee> shortcuts?
[08:38:19] <decx> i'd have the svg above bongjovi
[08:38:40] <soahccc> NoiseEee: keyboard binding
[08:39:42] <Eckyecky> Anyone familiar with Isotope?
[08:39:56] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ Eckyecky
[08:39:56] <b-ot> Eckyecky: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[08:40:01] <soahccc> NoiseEee: Our company uses Macs and I can capture all meta+ combinations withour problems. On windows though (partner company) you can't capture any win+ combination by the looks of it.
[08:40:59] <NoiseEee> soahccc: yeah i think the 'windows key' is not available at all
[08:41:07] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[08:41:13] <Eckyecky> I am using this method from isotope: http://isotope.metafizzy.co/methods.html#stamp - it stamps a block absolute positioned and the rest of the grid goes around it. The problem is that there are never elements above the stamp. I need a stamp in the center of the grid, but it just leaves blank space above it.
[08:41:14] <robertmaxrees> it's for system-level shortcuts
[08:41:38] <Eckyecky> Is there a way around this or is this a technical limitation?
[08:41:43] <soahccc> yeah on windows it is ctrl+ usually so I would like to switch it for those
[08:41:50] <Eckyecky> If it is, I wonder why, does anyone know?>
[08:42:05] <bl4ckdu5t> I know of the usage of $(this) but never had to use just $
[08:42:18] <bl4ckdu5t> I saw $.each(data, function(key, value)
[08:42:27] <bl4ckdu5t> Is this a correct statement
[08:42:28] <bl4ckdu5t> ?
[08:42:34] <robertmaxrees> bl4ckdu5t for objects and arrays, yes.
[08:42:38] <robertmaxrees> not for jquery objects, though.
[08:42:53] <robertmaxrees> bl4ckdu5t check out http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/
[08:43:44] <bl4ckdu5t> ok thanks robertmaxrees
[08:44:00] <bl4ckdu5t> is it in anyway related to $(this_
[08:44:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[08:44:06] <bl4ckdu5t> *$(this)
[08:44:17] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is a jquery-fied version of `this`
[08:44:38] <Eckyecky> it's a wrapper around 'this' so you can perform jquery operations
[08:44:50] <robertmaxrees> usually used to reference an element within a function, like event handlers or $.fn.each (not $.each)
[08:45:13] <bl4ckdu5t> ok good
[08:45:29] <robertmaxrees> if you were to do $(selector).each(function() { $(this) }), $(this) would reference whatever element the enumerator is currently on.
[08:46:04] <bl4ckdu5t> ok thanks again :)
[08:59:15] <Pymous> Hello
[08:59:23] <Pymous> I'm trying to display the loading widget, simply using : $.mobile.loading('show'), but it's not staying visible, do I need to initialize it or something ?
[09:42:53] <mooncup> hm what's wrong with my selector?
[09:42:57] <mooncup> $('.expand-btn[data-plan="annual"]')
[09:43:17] <mooncup> it's supposed to match a span that has that class and data attribute
[09:45:38] <tharkun> I'm rather new to jQuery documentation. I'm using the autocomplete widget with ajax calls. And although the select event is also tied to an ajax call. The ones done by autocomplete are done using the "GET" method. Can that be changed? Where is it documented?
[09:47:01] <cjohnson> tharkun: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[09:48:42] <tharkun> cjohnson: "a GET request" ... I want to change exactly that
[09:49:45] <tharkun> cjohnson: Just reread the next paragraph thanks. I think I can fix this :)
[09:49:47] <cjohnson> right, the source option is how you change where it gets its data
[09:49:50] <cjohnson> cool :)
[09:59:33] <kavi> Am working with jplayer with jquery ui (with sliders ) in drupal .
[09:59:47] <kavi> The sliders are working in firefox, safari, and IE
[09:59:51] <kavi> but not in chrome
[10:00:09] <kavi> is there a problem with jplayer for chrome ?
[10:00:13] <kavi> any idea ?
[10:14:14] <basiclaser_> hey guys!
[10:16:19] <basiclaser_> question: how do i unnasign a click event? I think that maybe i need unbind? i have this code here that i'd like to toggle off somehow https://gist.github.com/basiclaser/ba4b2ab7bdc5c2c38ad8
[10:16:26] <robertmaxrees> .off
[10:16:34] <robertmaxrees> oh...
[10:16:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?  alt+u?
[10:17:04] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have a custom framework at play here.
[10:17:29] <cjohnson> I have seen code like that posted a few times now
[10:17:36] <cjohnson> keydown with the key as teh selector
[10:17:39] <cjohnson> actually seems pretty neat
[10:17:55] <robertmaxrees> check their documentation.  also, that part where you do e.preventDefault() and e.stopPropagation() could be replaced by a single e.stopImmediatePropagation();
[10:19:32] <arschmitz> decx: sorry in meetings whats up?
[10:19:58] <basiclaser_> thanks guys, yes im using 'jquery hotkeys'
[10:20:34] <robertmaxrees> basiclaser_ their documentation tells you how to unbind btw
[10:22:37] <decx> arschmitz oh some guy had a compatibility problem on an ancient android not setting up the buttons with the new version
[10:22:59] <arschmitz> decx: ok
[10:23:12] <decx> the person is already gone though
[10:23:46] <arschmitz> decx: ah ok yeah been in meetings
[10:23:49] <arschmitz> still am lol
[10:24:54] <w3gi> hallo...
[10:25:36] <w3gi> $('#followbuttons').mouseover(function() {
[10:25:36] <w3gi> 		$('#followbuttons').animate({left:'0px'});
[10:25:36] <w3gi> 	});
[10:25:44] <mikehaas763> I use mvc's bundling features. So to avoid selector conflicts what do you do? Meaning that a js file with a selector could end up being loaded on a page it's not even used on because of the bundling. Do most people just implement a selector naming pattern that is unique per page?
[10:25:50] <robertmaxrees> w3gi :( don't paste into the channel ples
[10:25:54] <cjohnson> w3gi: ask a question, paste with a pastebin
[10:25:59] <w3gi> so i show a div with some images
[10:26:18] <w3gi> if i enter the image it works great
[10:26:40] <cjohnson> mikehaas763: wrap the stuff up in functions that only get called on the relevant pages
[10:26:53] <w3gi> if i move the mouse from one image to another then it jumps
[10:27:00] <mikehaas763> For example, I am using slickgrid. Two different js files need to $('#gridselector')
[10:27:08] <mikehaas763> cjohnson, I've got all my js in IIFE
[10:27:23] <cjohnson> er ok
[10:27:41] <cjohnson> the solution is still to just wrap code that is specific to one page and only call that code on the page ita applies to
[10:27:46] <cjohnson> it's not good to just shotgun your JS at every page
[10:28:11] <decx> i dont agree for the odd script
[10:28:22] <mikehaas763> cjohnson, how would _you implement it so that only a certain function is called for a certain page?
[10:28:31] <cjohnson> I would only call that function on that page
[10:28:35] <decx> one time longer loadtime vs cached on every subsequent page
[10:28:48] <cjohnson> I'm not saying don't bundle the code decx
[10:28:51] <cjohnson> just only call the relevant bits
[10:28:54] <robertmaxrees> w3gi a working jsfiddle would help us see what you're dealing with.
[10:29:17] <mikehaas763> I'm saying, how would you call a function?
[10:29:31] <mikehaas763> So that it only happens on a specific page
[10:29:37] <cjohnson> only put the function call on that page
[10:29:53] <mikehaas763> cjohnson, so you call it from a script element on the page itself?
[10:30:04] <cjohnson> load the bundled code and then use a script block to execute the relevant bits... or something more fancy
[10:30:15] <cjohnson> right
[10:30:42] <cjohnson> setupAllPages(); setupHomePage();
[10:30:44] <cjohnson> and on a different page
[10:30:53] <cjohnson> setupAllPages(); setupContactPage();
[10:31:00] <cjohnson> that's simplified, you can organize it better than that
[10:31:11] <cjohnson> but that's the general idea
[10:32:28] <mikehaas763> hmm, that's not too bad I guess. Was originally shooting for keeping all js out of the views but just the relevant invoke calls doesn't seem too bad
[10:32:58] <w3gi> robertmaxrees, jsfiddle?!
[10:33:11] <cjohnson> in my mvc, I wrote a behavior for the view that loads a per-action specific JS file. In that action-specific JS file I init anything that's only relevant to that page
[10:33:45] <cjohnson> so if I'm on /controller/action it loads js/controller/action.js which then calls $App.someLibInit();
[10:33:49] <cjohnson> not exactly but you get the point
[10:34:25] <cjohnson> you could inline the loading of action.js
[10:34:48] <mikehaas763> cjohnson, I like that idea... but ya was gonna say I may make it inline as opposed to an script load
[10:35:58] <robertmaxrees> w3gi http://jsfiddle.net/ - pasing multiline code into the channel doesn't really help.
[10:36:02] <robertmaxrees> a minimal test case, however, does.
[10:36:21] <mikehaas763> cjohnson, if you don't mind me asking, what exactly did you do to "write a behavior for the view"? Did you write a razor function?
[10:37:47] <jeffreylevesque> what's a good IRC client for google chrome?
[10:37:54] <mikehaas763> jeffreylevesque, none
[10:37:56] <mikehaas763> lol
[10:38:04] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[10:38:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah, DL a desktop application for that.
[10:38:26] <jeffreylevesque> good point
[10:38:32] <mikehaas763> I tried a couple/few not long ago from the web store and I didn't like any.. none of them even came close to hexchat or limechat which is what I use
[10:38:33] <jeffreylevesque> i've been using chatzilla for the longest time
[10:39:02] <Nhyig> Why this line var lkj = $("#setCaption").html().replace('-', '/'); just change the first "-" and the rest not
[10:39:34] <robertmaxrees> Nhyig because it stops at the first -
[10:39:45] <Nhyig> how can I change it?
[10:39:46] <robertmaxrees> you want a regular expression
[10:39:54] <robertmaxrees>  $("#setCaption").html().replace(/-/g, '/'); i think.
[10:39:58] <mikehaas763> I can't even find the docs for a jquery replace() function
[10:40:07] <robertmaxrees> because there aren't.
[10:40:14] <robertmaxrees> he's using javascript's string.replace.
[10:40:20] <mikehaas763> ah duh
[10:40:24] <mikehaas763> html() returns a string
[10:41:11] <Nhyig> robertmaxrees : yes man,thank you so much
[10:41:22] <robertmaxrees> Nhyig fsho
[10:45:21] * CssNoob good morning and good night y'all
[10:45:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:49:03] <kinesis> can anyone help me with this one? http://jsfiddle.net/a23ova84/3/
[10:49:19] <robertmaxrees> sounds about right.
[10:49:24] <robertmaxrees> .prop() edits the DOM node.
[10:49:27] <robertmaxrees> not the markup.
[10:49:31] <robertmaxrees> which is generally what you want.
[10:49:43] <kinesis> i think the selector is wrong or something
[10:49:48] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:50:02] <kinesis> if you check element.style in inspect element it is empty
[10:50:05] <robertmaxrees> right.
[10:50:05] <JustPie> Hey all. I am adding a dynamic overlay to one of my pages using (body).append(); How would I select the dynamic by id? ( without doing a click )
[10:50:17] <robertmaxrees> KindOne .prop() edits the underling DOM node, not the markup.
[10:50:23] <robertmaxrees> which is what you actually want.
[10:50:29] <robertmaxrees> err, *kinesis
[10:50:37] <kinesis> How come it isn't taking effect on my site
[10:50:50] <robertmaxrees> you probably have another issue.
[10:50:53] <kinesis> let me try increasing it's width
[10:51:05] <cjohnson> mikehaas763: cakephp makes it pretty easy to define asset dependencies in your view or controller, I overrode that asset loader to automatically add the named file to the list of deps if it exists
[10:51:12] <kinesis> http://jsfiddle.net/a23ova84/4/
[10:51:17] <kinesis> Now ncrease logo's width by 500px
[10:51:19] <robertmaxrees> kinesis also, check out what .attr('width') actually returns ;)
[10:51:50] <decx> there is no .post_float .fade on the page
[10:51:53] <decx> there is .fade
[10:51:56] <decx> but that doesnt count
[10:52:02] <kinesis> it does nothing :)
[10:52:09] <kinesis> http://jsfiddle.net/a23ova84/6/
[10:52:12] <kinesis> I put an alert() in
[10:52:13] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/a23ova84/7/
[10:52:25] <kinesis> Ok
[10:52:29] <kinesis> Ok fixed it
[10:52:37] <robertmaxrees> also - use .css() to edit css.
[10:52:44] <kinesis> http://jsfiddle.net/a23ova84/8/
[10:53:58] <robertmaxrees> like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/a23ova84/10/
[10:54:45] <kinesis> it it isnt centering the logo :)
[10:54:46] <cjohnson> JustPie: give the overlay an id as you append it and select it with your standard jquery id selector
[10:55:06] <robertmaxrees> kinesis it is in the fiddle.
[10:55:24] <kinesis> i am at http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/a23ova84/10/
[10:55:47] <robertmaxrees> ah, broken in chrome
[10:55:58] <kinesis> might be conflicting css
[10:56:12] <JustPie> cjohnson : When i do $('#overlay').length it always returns zero. I am positive that the ID is correct.
[10:56:22] <kinesis> Nah removing it didnt work
[10:56:43] <robertmaxrees> kinesis http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/a23ova84/14/
[10:56:45] <robertmaxrees> this is what you want.
[10:56:50] <robertmaxrees> no need to remove that prop/attr
[10:56:56] <cjohnson> JustPie: if $('#overlay').length is 0, there is no element with an id=overlay on the page at the time you call that code
[10:57:09] <cjohnson> so either the ID is wrong, you're not setting the ID correctly, or you're chekcing for the element before it exists
[10:57:46] <cjohnson> inspect the element with your inspector
[10:59:13] <kinesis> it made changes to all the images.. not just the ones < 299px
[10:59:16] <kinesis> any idea why?
[10:59:45] <w3gi> robertmaxrees, http://jsfiddle.net/Lnxy591k/
[10:59:57] <JustPie> cjohnson: I think i got it! I think it was an async issue
[11:00:11] <JustPie> Thanks!
[11:00:12] <robertmaxrees> kinesis i'd have to see it in action.
[11:00:14] <kinesis> yeah it applied the CSS to all the images doh
[11:00:14] <cjohnson> no prob
[11:01:05] <robertmaxrees> w3gi so the issue it the repeating stuff?
[11:01:50] <w3gi> yes the issue is that the symbols "jump"
[11:01:52] <cjohnson> you could put a delay on the hide action
[11:02:02] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lnxy591k/2/
[11:02:05] <robertmaxrees> .stop() is what you want.
[11:02:23] <cjohnson> oh neat
[11:03:02] <cjohnson> I would have made some overly complicated debouncer
[11:03:35] <kinesis> nice i got it.
[11:04:53] <w3gi> robertmaxrees, thanks a lot...
[11:05:20] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[11:06:55] <Deele> hello
[11:07:12] <Deele> is it possible to create jquery collection out from zero elements?
[11:07:41] <Deele> I'm creating bunch of elements, and I want them to store inside single variable and append them all together to another element
[11:07:55] <cjohnson> $('#anIdThatDoesntExist') is a jquery collection with 0 elements
[11:08:01] <cjohnson> maybe $() would work
[11:08:18] <robertmaxrees> nah, needs a selector of some kind.
[11:08:25] <robertmaxrees> well, if you want it to inherit right.
[11:08:33] <Deele> $() returns []
[11:08:48] <robertmaxrees> err.
[11:08:56] <cjohnson> that may be your console lying to you
[11:08:59] <Deele> the same as not existing selector
[11:09:05] <cjohnson> yeah, it is that then
[11:09:14] <robertmaxrees> proof?
[11:09:33] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jkdb3288/
[11:09:36] <cjohnson> $().each  returns a function for me
[11:09:39] <robertmaxrees> $() doesn't return []
[11:09:46] <dcherman2> robertmaxrees: no it doesn't, $() works fine.
[11:09:52] <Deele> $().add($('<div/>', {'class': 'test1'})).add($('<div/>', {'class': 'test2'})) works, thx
[11:09:57] <dcherman2> ( an empty jquery object )
[11:10:11] <robertmaxrees> Deele btw, that doesn't save the original object btw.
[11:10:40] <robertmaxrees> .add() doesn't update the original collection, i mean.
[11:10:49] <robertmaxrees> creates a new one for you to save later.
[11:11:06] <Deele> yes, append would be required to update collection, right?
[11:11:18] <robertmaxrees> in place yeah.
[11:11:32] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you need to do var $myThing = $myThing.add($otherStuff);
[11:11:47] <kinesis> What is all this extra space below a page in in iframe and how do I get rid of it?
[11:12:15] <robertmaxrees> kinesis it's... white space on the source page?
[11:12:18] <kinesis> if I edit the css in the page in the iframe : body { height:(height - 1000px) it might help
[11:12:29] <robertmaxrees> you could also edit the iframe height.
[11:12:43] <kinesis> its like 500-1000 pixels of fat.. if I reduce iframe height I get a scrollbar
[11:12:55] <robertmaxrees> you can disable those, too :)
[11:12:56] <kinesis> I'm using fancybox.. complicated
[11:13:08] <robertmaxrees> scrolling="no"
[11:13:19] <kinesis> ok ill try "no" in qotes again
[11:13:24] <robertmaxrees> or use overflow: hidden; in your CSS.
[11:13:39] <robertmaxrees> or both
[11:14:29] <sekyms> Has anyone seen pachett recently?
[11:15:50] <kinesis> Well I want the entire post to load , but I don't want 600 pixels of white space

[11:31:52] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[11:32:20] <Axy> How can I do it :)
[11:32:24] <Axy> I mean, is there any function that returns the last child of an object
[11:32:28] <Axy> because in my case, the last child can be anything
[11:32:32] <Axy> an input, a div, an img
[11:32:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:32:54] <Axy> uhm.
[11:32:54] <robertmaxrees> the last child, you mean?
[11:32:57] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: what about this? $('#sidebar ul').append(li.append(a.append(span)));
[11:33:03] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee sure.

[11:33:21] <Axy> and if the last one is an image
[11:33:25] <Axy> the thing should return it
[11:33:33] <Axy> Oh there is a selector for it
[11:33:34] <Axy> :D
[11:33:34] <cjohnson> .children().last() ?

[12:04:30] <tasaif> I'd like to pick your brain for a minute
[12:05:22] <tasaif> in what situation would a $.ajax error: console.log('foo') fire, but $.ajax error: function(){console.log 'foo') not fire?
[12:08:16] <gaabrieelp> anyone can help me with jQuery UI?
[12:09:08] <gaabrieelp> with the draggable function?
[12:13:06] <srsgores> Hey guys, wondering if anyone can advise on how to deal with the responseText from a failed promise.  I have this, and want to only extract the "message" object: "{"status":"failed","code":"400","error":{"message":"Missing required fields","type":"FieldExceptionError"}}"
[12:14:32] <shoky> JSON.parse(xhr.responseText).error.message
[12:15:18] <Paradisee> how can i make an action when i press on a <li> ? http://dpaste.com/24PZTAP
[12:15:51] <Paradisee> i generate some <li> by taking some info via json
[12:16:02] <shoky> add a click event handler
[12:16:11] <Paradisee> and id like add a click on em
[12:16:13] <srsgores> shoky: try JSON.parse("{"status":"failed","code":"400","error":{"message":"Missing required fields","type":"FieldExceptionError"}}")
[12:16:20] <srsgores> you get Unexpected identifier
[12:16:31] <srsgores> ah
[12:16:33] <srsgores> wait
[12:16:37] <srsgores> need to escape double quotes
[12:16:52] <srsgores> got it
[12:16:53] <srsgores> thanks
[12:16:53] <shoky> srsgores: surround it with '
[12:20:19] <gaabrieelp> I'm trying to do this: if ($.ui == undefined) { Console.log("Get jQuery ui"); $.getScript('https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.2/jquery-ui.js'); }	$('#hybrisHeader').draggable(dragHybrisMenu);  But I'm receiving this error on chrome console: Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[12:20:47] <robertmaxrees> because draggable isn't ready whgen you call it.
[12:20:57] <robertmaxrees> you need to call in in the callback for getScript.
[12:21:58] <gaabrieelp> the file that i'm using it is this: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/0pb65boz3q2wlfv/hybrisPlugDJ.js

[12:26:09] <shoky> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[12:26:27] <shoky> what the hell is this doing there:  $( ".result" ).html( "<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>" );
[12:26:35] <cjohnson> gaabrieelp: right. you need to do as he said ;)
[12:27:06] <gaabrieelp> the same error with it:
[12:27:07] <gaabrieelp> if ($.ui == undefined) {
[12:27:07] <gaabrieelp> 		console.log("Get jQuery ui");
[12:27:07] <gaabrieelp> 		$.getScript('https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.js',function(){
[12:27:07] <gaabrieelp> 				$( "#hybrisHeader" ).draggable();});
[12:27:07] <gaabrieelp> 	}
[12:27:22] <cjohnson> it's not jquery that you need for draggable
[12:27:24] <cjohnson> it's jquery ui
[12:28:33] <gaabrieelp> sorry, i put the wrong url now ;P
[12:28:53] <tasaif> in what situation would a $.ajax error: console.log('foo') fire, but $.ajax error: function(){console.log 'foo') not fire?
[12:29:14] <cjohnson> tasaif: paste your code please
[12:29:26] <cjohnson> console.log is not an operator btw
[12:29:31] <cjohnson> needs parenthesis
[12:30:05] <cjohnson> if you're specifying it like this though
[12:30:15] <cjohnson> $.ajax({ error: console.log('foo'); });
[12:30:16] <cjohnson> that's wrong
[12:30:44] <cjohnson> error expects a reference to a function, not whatever console.log() returns
[12:30:57] <cjohnson> $.ajax({ error: console.log }); would probably work for instance
[12:31:01] <Voyage> How can I compare keywords used on google and can choose my keywords?
[12:31:21] <cjohnson> that's not a jquery question Voyage try #web or ##web I forget which

[12:31:29] <tasaif> http://hastebin.com/qorikufowa.coffee
[12:31:53] <cjohnson> sorry, I'm not familiar with coffee script
[12:31:59] <cjohnson> can you paste the compiled JS if possible?
[12:32:00] <tasaif> one sec
[12:32:03] <tasaif> yea
[12:32:05] <cjohnson> thanks
[12:32:10] <gaabrieelp> cjohnson: the same error: http://prntscr.com/55qqyu
[12:32:45] <tasaif> http://hastebin.com/umifonabav.coffee
[12:33:05] <cjohnson> gaabrieelp: can you include the line number in the error? or link to the page this script is included on?
[12:33:23] <cjohnson> tasaif: that looks fine
[12:33:28] <tasaif> that's what I thought
[12:33:35] <tasaif> for some reason, the error is not being called
[12:34:00] <cjohnson> check the network tab, are you sure it's an ajax error?
[12:35:10] <cjohnson> for instance... I recently found a bug in my software where I was returning a "page not found" error but not actually sending the correct 404 error, thus error would not fire
[12:35:22] <gaabrieelp> cjohnson: http://prntscr.com/55qscd   to enter in the page you need to register..
[12:35:22] <cjohnson> alternatively, if you're making a cross-site request, it won't call the error callback
[12:35:29] <cjohnson> the browser will toss its own exception for that
[12:35:36] * tasaif facepalm
[12:36:02] <cjohnson> unless it's JSONP I imagine
[12:36:11] <tasaif> thanks cjohnson
[12:36:44] <cjohnson> gaabrieelp: do I need to pay? I can register
[12:36:54] <cjohnson> your error popup thing isn't very useful
[12:36:57] <cjohnson> can you try this in chrome?
[12:37:06] <gaabrieelp> no, is free
[12:37:18] <gaabrieelp> yup, in chrome
[12:38:21] <cjohnson> odd okay
[12:38:27] <gaabrieelp> the link is: https://plug.dj/brasilmusic
[12:38:27] <cjohnson> well I bet you need to nest your getScript calls
[12:38:33] <gaabrieelp> u can use this user:
[12:38:46] <cjohnson> actually... are you trying to use jquery to load jquery? :P
[12:38:50] <gaabrieelp> testecad@teste.com
[12:38:55] <gaabrieelp> pass: testecad
[12:39:51] <cjohnson> ah you removed that other getScript call. which page am I going to to see this error?
[12:40:44] <gaabrieelp> to call the script u need to paste it on chrome url: javascript:(function(){$.getScript('https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/0pb65boz3q2wlfv/hybrisPlugDJ.js');}());
[12:42:18] <cjohnson> fyi you can just put $.getScript('https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/0pb65boz3q2wlfv/hybrisPlugDJ.js');  into your JS console and run it from there
[12:42:25] <cjohnson> no need to use the url bar
[12:43:25] <gaabrieelp> well, I did not know that;)
[12:48:45] <gaabrieelp> cjohnson: was able to test the error?
[12:49:01] <cjohnson> yeah... I'm not sure exactly what's up
[12:49:05] <cjohnson> it appears to load jquery ui
[12:49:25] <cjohnson> I repeated by running this in my console: $.getScript('//code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.2/jquery-ui.js', function() { console.log('got jquery ui'); });
[12:49:48] <cjohnson> but $.ui / jQuery.ui are undefined
[12:50:15] <cjohnson> maybe $.getScript cross domain sandboxes the code in some way...
[12:50:21] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getscript/
[12:50:23] <cjohnson> I don't see a <script> node on the DOM for it
[12:50:27] <robertmaxrees> "The callback is fired once the script has been loaded but not necessarily executed."
[12:50:39] <cjohnson> how does one...execute it?
[12:50:56] <cjohnson> even well after the fact $.ui is empty
[12:51:07] <robertmaxrees> then something else is broken.
[12:51:13] <cjohnson> yeah sounds like it
[12:51:36] <cjohnson> yeah if I do that same thing in another page it works okay
[12:53:00] <gaabrieelp> cjohnson: but here it works better: http://hastebin.com/oluwuqilir.xml
[12:53:36] <gaabrieelp> line 1010
[12:54:02] <cjohnson> right, there's something else broken about your page that's breaking jquery ui
[12:54:44] <gaabrieelp> only the jquery ui is different
[12:55:08] <sahbeewah> the reason it’s not working is because of requirejs
[12:55:14] <gaabrieelp> he used this jquery ui: http://hastebin.com/hubebozeme.coffee
[12:55:37] <sahbeewah> requirejs has handles on imported scripts and does magic with it
[12:56:39] <sahbeewah> so, instead of using getScript, you should actually make use of requirejs and load your scripts with it
[12:58:25] <gaabrieelp> well, I'll see about RequireJS
[12:59:36] <OderZug> hello could i ask here a sql question
[12:59:44] <robertmaxrees> OderZug please go to a room about sql.
[13:00:44] <OderZug> robertmaxrees, thanks for the directions, the thing is that this concerns  proberbly the browser and sql,  i need a way to query for new rows when i use the browse scrollbar down
[13:01:05] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[13:01:24] <robertmaxrees> you're looking for infinite scroll
[13:02:00] <OderZug> uh yes,  i think, well until all rows of the table are loaded and displayed in the internet browser
[13:02:34] <robertmaxrees> right.  that technique is called "infinite scroll"
[13:02:40] <robertmaxrees> lots of articles about how to do it.
[13:02:43] <OderZug> ow ok
[13:02:47] <OderZug> aha ok. ok
[13:04:18] <OderZug> robertmaxrees and you have a suggestion of a url.  the thing is in some way the browser needs to know that rows r50  to r100 is displayed
[13:04:19] <krambiorix> hi, i have some fields in a table. When i press tab on the firstfield, it moves horizontally to the next table cell's field. How can i make it focus the next table row's field (vertically) ?
[13:06:39] <AtomicB0mB> its $serialize necessary when sending a form via ajax? i mean, if the type is POST, and my .php file is getting through $_POST['name'] why should I serialize the form?
[13:06:52] <AtomicB0mB> ops, serialize()...
[13:07:08] <robertmaxrees> you just need a way to serialize that data into the post object.
[13:07:17] <robertmaxrees> doens't really matter how you do it.
[13:07:52] <AtomicB0mB> i have a form. and i have a php file. in the submit button, i have the ajax function ok? and it sends to my php files via POST.
[13:08:02] <robertmaxrees> ajax or not?
[13:08:12] <robertmaxrees> if it's via ajax, you need to serialize that data somehow.
[13:08:15] <AtomicB0mB> in the php file, i save the data like $name = $_POST['name'] etc,,, and send the email
[13:08:27] <AtomicB0mB> so why the serialize() function
[13:08:40] <robertmaxrees> it's a quick way of serializing the form.
[13:09:28] <AtomicB0mB> so u are telling me that if i didnt use "data: $('form').serialize() my .php file wont get the data via post?
[13:09:35] <P0rk> does anybody here have a nice library of keycode/charcode constants for use in jquery?  like KEY.SPACE={charcode:32,keycode:???};
[13:11:12] <robertmaxrees> AtomicB0mB that's one way, sure.
[13:11:17] <robertmaxrees> not the only way
[13:12:04] <AtomicB0mB> hummm ok =)
[13:12:13] <AtomicB0mB> i was just wondering about it hehehe
[13:12:15] <AtomicB0mB> thank you robert
[13:13:21] <bbclover> guys if I want to call a function if a certain element is clicked, can I do $('#abc').click(myFunction());? I have written the function and everything but it doesn't seem to be working
[13:13:25] <bbclover> Well it's not working at all
[13:13:30] <cjohnson> bbclover: remove the ()
[13:13:35] <robertmaxrees> bbclover .click(myFunction)
[13:13:47] <cjohnson> .click() expects a reference to a function, not the value that myFunction() returns
[13:13:58] <cjohnson> myFunction() executes the function
[13:14:00] <bbclover> oh it's like a callback?
[13:14:05] <robertmaxrees> it IS a callback
[13:14:05] <cjohnson> yes
[13:14:08] <robertmaxrees> not "like" one
[13:14:09] <bbclover> holy smokes
[13:14:13] <bbclover> who woulda thought
[13:14:16] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[13:14:19] <cjohnson> :P
[13:14:19] <krambiorix>  i have some fields in a table. When i press tab on the firstfield, it moves horizontally to the next table cell's field. How can i make it focus the next table row's field (vertically) ?
[13:14:20] <AtomicB0mB> hahaah
[13:14:38] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix we're not able to magically visualize your problem - do you have an example?
[13:14:52] <cjohnson> you could use tabindex
[13:15:45] <bbclover> it worked yaty
[13:15:52] <robertmaxrees> ooh that's what he's trying to do.
[13:16:05] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix capture the tab key event, prevent default, then move focus.
[13:16:54] <krambiorix> cjohnson, any example?
[13:17:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:17:10] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix what about the explanation doens't make sense?
[13:17:13] <cjohnson> use his approach
[13:17:14] <krambiorix> cjohnson, or you mean set the tabindex on the elements?
[13:17:22] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, relax man
[13:17:31] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:17:41] <robertmaxrees> i AM relaxed, just curious to see what you've tried.
[13:17:47] <cjohnson> you would set the tabindex on the elements but that is a big mess
[13:17:58] <cjohnson> if you have 100 rows of 5 columns that's 500 tabindex values you need to fill in
[13:19:27] <krambiorix> cjohnson, i have 20
[13:19:38] <cjohnson> tables grow
[13:19:54] <cjohnson> just capture the tab event
[13:25:37] <markalanevans> ey folks, is there a way to pre load jQuery plugins code before jQuery is on the page, then once jQuery is loaded, then "inject" the plugins so that they have access the jQuery object?
[13:26:13] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[13:27:50] <markalanevans> robertmaxrees: i'm building a js plugin that works similar to the way google analytics does in regards to being loaded by a short snippet in the footer of your page
[13:28:14] <markalanevans> The snippet loads this "bundled.js" file which ideally has all the js code it might need.
[13:28:26] <markalanevans> Then once loaded it starts inject libs on the page etc
[13:28:41] <markalanevans> but if the user already has jQuery i don't want to load jQuery
[13:28:57] <markalanevans> but i also need jQuery so that i can use some plugins
[13:29:14] <markalanevans> but if i try to load the plugins before jQuery i so the page, obviously i get errors
[13:29:26] <P0rk> wrap your code in a closure and pass it the jquery object?
[13:30:47] <markalanevans> P0rk: you mean an anonymous founction?  (function(){})(); ?
[13:31:31] <robertmaxrees> That won't work, either.
[13:31:56] <P0rk> I think so. Something like that. I imagine it's like when another framework uses the $ alias...listen to robertmaxrees, he knows
[13:32:05] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:32:18] <markalanevans> So far, the only idea i have is to mess with the plugins
[13:32:45] <markalanevans> i'd ahve to take the code wrap them in some sort of object that has like an init method
[13:32:58] <robertmaxrees> you need to test for existance first.
[13:33:05] <robertmaxrees> but honestly, i'd avoid doing it all in the first place.
[13:33:10] <markalanevans> then i could have the code ready in a function, but not have the plugins do their auto call
[13:33:36] <robertmaxrees> because what if they have jquery, but a version that isn't compatible with what you need?
[13:33:43] <markalanevans> robertmaxrees: so the limitation, is that i'm trying to reduce the # of js loads
[13:34:01] <robertmaxrees> sure, but you're making a flawed assumption
[13:34:03] <markalanevans> so i could o it w/ a simple check and then if not present, load the jquery, then do another call to load alll my js files
[13:34:22] <markalanevans> But then i end up with like 3 calls
[13:34:34] <cjohnson> just bundle your code
[13:34:35] <markalanevans> User loads page,  which triggers the basic script loader script.
[13:34:41] <cjohnson> don't solve a deployment issue with javascript
[13:34:52] <robertmaxrees> sure - and you're assuming the version of jquery they're using is compatible with what you need.
[13:34:56] <robertmaxrees> avoid using jquery in this case.
[13:35:01] <robertmaxrees> OR namespace it and load it anyway.
[13:35:05] <robertmaxrees> brb
[13:35:19] <markalanevans> that script that loads, checks to see if jQuery is present, if not it loads it, then does another js load for my actuall bundle.js which includes all the plugins plus my app and the init of my app.
[13:35:53] <markalanevans> cjohnson: is this a deployment issue?
[13:36:15] <cjohnson> you're really not going to be able to write a plugin that effectively does this. you can ask the users to change the way they include your plugin but that makes it not very plugin-like
[13:36:21] <cjohnson> you could, for instance, use requirejs
[13:36:25] <cjohnson> or a promise, even
[13:36:35] <cjohnson> but that's up to the implementation, your plugin can't solve around that
[13:36:55] <cjohnson> if your only goal is to make fewer JS requests then yes, it's a deployment issue
[13:37:04] <markalanevans> Well i'm playing w/ using  either grunt or browserify to build my single bundled js file
[13:37:07] <cjohnson> the deployment of your site to your server should be aggregating JS together anyway
[13:37:45] <cjohnson> regardless the solution isn't going to be in the way you write your plugin, it will be in its implementation
[13:38:09] <markalanevans> For example?
[13:38:30] <cjohnson> like I just said
[13:38:33] <cjohnson> a promise, or requirejs
[13:38:35] <cjohnson> or bundling your JS
[13:38:44] <robertmaxrees> back
[13:39:01] <cjohnson> whoa I didn't see you join
[13:39:04] <cjohnson> maybe I ignored joins
[13:39:08] <robertmaxrees> prolly
[13:39:57] <cjohnson> derp yeah I ignored joins and parts but not quits...forgot I ignored joins/parts, saw quit, assumed I should see join
[13:41:07] <markalanevans> So cjohnson i'm not following.   how is requireJs going to help me?
[13:41:30] <cjohnson> nevermind, it's not. I was thinking of using it like a promise
[13:41:38] <markalanevans> Hmm.
[13:41:38] <cjohnson> maybe a promise+requirejs
[13:42:17] <robertmaxrees> is this for the thing we were talking about before?
[13:42:20] <cjohnson> or something like that. a promise where your plugin will run once jquery has loaded
[13:42:23] <markalanevans> robertmaxrees: yea
[13:42:23] <cjohnson> yeah
[13:42:40] <markalanevans> The namespace might be legit.
[13:43:05] <markalanevans> i'm fine with all my app + jquery + jqueryPlugins + libs.js  all in their own namespace
[13:43:07] <cjohnson> so gross though...that's not a jquery plugin
[13:43:11] <cjohnson> if it includes jquery
[13:43:37] <cjohnson> what all does your plugin do, it sounds like it might not even need jquery?
[13:43:46] <markalanevans> i just need to build a js widget that doesn't interfere with existing js, but has all the required files in a single load.
[13:44:00] <robertmaxrees> what does that file do?
[13:44:42] <robertmaxrees> if this is intended to be used on 3rd party websites, don't include jquery no matter what.
[13:44:50] <markalanevans> Its a wizard tool that our customers add to their page, and then we power a service on their site.
[13:45:10] <markalanevans> robertmaxrees: why not?
[13:45:16] <robertmaxrees> i worked for a provider that did something similar.
[13:45:23] <cjohnson> hrm
[13:45:29] <robertmaxrees> it's an extra dependency that'll cause everybody headaches
[13:45:36] <markalanevans> i don't wont't to rewrite jquery ish, i just be able to load it in and use it.
[13:45:44] <robertmaxrees> what do you need it for?
[13:45:48] <markalanevans> there is lots of UI manipuation
[13:45:51] <cjohnson> you might just have to include your own namespaced jquery
[13:45:52] <Bloomberg> hi
[13:46:06] <Bloomberg> how can I replace all the "/" ina char by "-"
[13:46:08] <Bloomberg> Ihave this
[13:46:08] <Bloomberg> replace(/ / /g, ' - ')
[13:46:12] <cjohnson> or use the page's jQuery if it exists by the time your code runs
[13:46:16] <Bloomberg> But I think is wron
[13:46:19] <Bloomberg> wrong*
[13:46:21] <cjohnson> I wouldn' try to do anything more complicated than that
[13:46:32] <robertmaxrees> Bloomberg you want to escape the slash.
[13:46:35] <cjohnson> but ideally you would just tell them to include your script after jquery
[13:46:37] <Bloomberg> yes
[13:46:41] <cjohnson> and not do any of this evil
[13:46:48] <robertmaxrees> search google Bloomberg :)
[13:47:37] <markalanevans> So if i remove my concern of having the extra js load this all goes away though...
[13:47:50] <markalanevans> Because ideally we are a self containted app
[13:48:23] <cjohnson> I'd take an extra request for containability if you're servicing third parties
[13:48:42] <markalanevans> Yea, i think its probably the cleanest way to do it.
[13:49:10] <robertmaxrees> is this something that'll be loaded  by anybody visiting the page?
[13:49:25] <markalanevans> i could have to builds that i load, one that has jquery + myApp  and one with just myApp for the case where jquery is already on the page.
[13:49:43] <markalanevans> robertmaxrees: what do you mean?
[13:49:45] <robertmaxrees> except jquery existing doesn't mean anything.
[13:49:50] <robertmaxrees> it could be an incompatible version.
[13:50:01] <markalanevans> robertmaxrees: well i check for a version of jquery or greater
[13:50:10] <robertmaxrees> that's not a good thing to do.
[13:50:22] <markalanevans> why?
[13:50:25] <cjohnson> does jquery still have the "build your own jquery" thing to get a stripped down version?
[13:50:32] <robertmaxrees> because 1.8 to 1.9 broke a lot.
[13:50:33] <cjohnson> maybe just do that and paste the results right into your third party script
[13:50:39] <robertmaxrees> and features change enough that it's not reliable imo.
[13:51:04] <markalanevans> fair enough.
[13:51:06] <robertmaxrees> you're also adding page weight to the page it's getting added to - i know my company is starting to yell at 3rd parties that do that sort of stuff.
[13:51:20] <markalanevans> robertmaxrees: so what would you suggest?
[13:51:26] <markalanevans> Whats the best approache?
[13:52:04] <robertmaxrees> depending on what exactly you're doing, it's hard to say.  if jquery really feels appropriate, load it, but namespace it.  alternatively, don't use a library at all.
[13:52:05] <markalanevans> i need to be able to use the UI and ajax features of jquery. I'd rather not roll my own.
[13:52:31] <robertmaxrees> then load the version you need and go from there.
[13:52:39] <cjohnson> no more jquery builder but you could just get the DOM and ajax stuff from the jquery source
[13:52:47] <cjohnson> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/master/src/
[13:52:53] <markalanevans> so robertmaxrees so how do i namepace the version i need and tell all the plugins i load to use that eversion?
[13:53:04] <robertmaxrees> even if it already exists, if you have your own plugins you're mucking with their copy which creates nightmare scenarios.
[13:53:08] <robertmaxrees> depends on the plugins.
[13:53:14] <robertmaxrees> some of them don't follow conventions properly.
[13:53:19] <markalanevans> assume they do.
[13:53:35] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/
[13:53:41] <markalanevans> whats the strategy for namespacing jquery
[13:53:44] <markalanevans> reading ^^
[13:53:53] <robertmaxrees> or use a closure.
[13:53:58] <robertmaxrees> *IIFE
[13:54:15] <robertmaxrees> (function() { /* this is all protected */ })();
[13:54:17] <robertmaxrees> and avoid global vars.
[13:59:12] <markalanevans> robertmaxrees: so if i had a (function(){   //Load jQuery, //Load jQuery plugins, //Load Chart.js //Load myApp.js   myApp.init()  })();
[13:59:20] <markalanevans> Everything would be protected?
[13:59:31] <robertmaxrees> depends on how you "load" them.
[13:59:35] <markalanevans> robertmaxrees: right now i'm using  head.js
[13:59:50] <robertmaxrees> you'll probably have to abandon that.
[14:00:11] <robertmaxrees> but i'm not sure.
[14:00:36] <markalanevans> head.test(jqueryDoesNotExists(), _tsw.jquery, "myApp.js", this.main);
[14:01:06] <robertmaxrees> dunno how that might allow you do namespace stuff.
[14:01:12] <robertmaxrees> but don't test for existence yo.
[14:01:17] <markalanevans> robertmaxrees: well i can use that in the namespace
[14:01:20] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to be a viable solution.
[14:01:36] <markalanevans> probably won't really inject it into the anon function though...
[14:02:07] <markalanevans> Is there a way to hava an anon func that inside it i load code from differnt files into it?
[14:02:11] <robertmaxrees> you need to use something to protect youer copy for somebody else.
[14:02:19] <markalanevans> or does everything need to be preloaded and the passed in?
[14:02:43] <markalanevans> robertmaxrees: i though that was what i got w/ the anonymous func: function() { /* this is all protected */ })();
[14:03:08] <markalanevans> So inside that, i'd like to load the jquery + plugings + libs + app
[14:03:22] <robertmaxrees> functions in general scope it.
[14:03:47] <robertmaxrees> but you might need to play around to get jquery to load in noconflict mode initially.
[14:04:04] <markalanevans> hmmm.
[14:19:46] <fuse405> Can someone have a look at http://fpaste.scsys.co.uk/439668
[14:20:56] <robertmaxrees> func1() { wat
[14:21:53] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/bqx8a3a/
[14:21:57] <robertmaxrees> this is what you want.
[14:32:12] <Besan> any tutorials on jQuery Mobile notifivsations ?
[14:32:14] <Besan> Please ?
[14:32:22] <Besan> Any ideas in general ?
[14:33:11] <srsgores> Besan: you could try https://github.com/t4t5/sweetalert
[14:33:32] <srsgores> guess it depends on what you mean by "notifications"
[14:33:54] <srsgores> if you want the native kind, you can check out phonegap for that
[14:34:04] <Besan> Yes, native
[14:34:07] <srsgores> ok
[14:34:11] <srsgores> one, sec
[14:34:13] <Besan> Like FB notifications
[14:34:15] <srsgores> there's actually something you can use
[14:34:35] <srsgores> Besan: check out https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/notification
[14:34:35] <Besan> Like a regular Text Message notif
[14:35:12] <srsgores> not sure that this would work on older webkit browsers, but it's probably your best option
[14:35:41] <Besan> srsgores, thanks a lot. Seems like this is what i'm looking fort
[14:35:42] <Besan> ;(
[14:35:44] <Besan> :)
[14:35:48] <Besan> *for
[14:35:54] <Besan> Hate my laptop
[14:37:02] <srsgores> Besan: it's ok.  I might advise you also look at checking for browser support with modernizr as well
[14:37:27] <srsgores> If it's not supported, you could fall back to something like jQuery UI's modsls
[14:37:30] <srsgores> modals *
[14:38:25] <Besan> I'm working with JQM on an android app . . . I need to notify my user about something new . . . I need to use somehow the native NAVBAR
[14:38:27] <srsgores> this also looks interesting: https://github.com/pwnall/w3gram-js
[14:38:52] <srsgores> yeah, the notification API is your best bet
[14:39:05] <srsgores> but phonegap is probably more reliable
[14:39:27] <Besan> Thanks a lot again
[14:39:28] <srsgores> http://devgirl.org/2013/07/17/tutorial-implement-push-notifications-in-your-phonegap-application/
[14:39:41] <Besan> atleast i have an idea of what to work with :)
[14:41:05] <srsgores> just be thankful you don't have to deal with the s*** iOS devs have to deal with under the NSNotification, and setting when it has to "fire again", even though that's mostly irrelevant anyway...
[14:47:23] <t4nk846> てｓｔ
[14:50:04] <Oka> test working?
[15:01:55] <Axy> Hello channel
[15:02:05] <Axy> so I have one base.js file for generic functions on my website
[15:02:10] <Axy> and every page has it's own js file
[15:02:12] <Axy> like about.js
[15:02:14] <Axy> home.js
[15:02:16] <Axy> whatever
[15:02:22] <Axy> that base.js is for generic functions
[15:02:36] <Axy> Now, I need document ready function for jquery
[15:02:42] <Axy> in my base as well
[15:03:02] <Axy> but I'm getting an "Uncought syntaxerror: unexpected token ;" error
[15:03:20] <Axy> can I use multiple document ready functions in a single page?
[15:03:24] <robertmaxrees> yes
[15:05:43] <Axy> robertmaxrees, then why am I getting this error?
[15:05:46] <Axy> do you have any idea
[15:06:51] <Axy> my initial script works, and in my other "base.js" file I just created, I only have this: http://pastebin.com/SXb85Bik robertmaxrees
[15:07:31] <robertmaxrees> you're missing a closing )
[15:07:35] <robertmaxrees> });
[15:07:55] <Axy> OH!
[15:07:58] <Axy> silly me
[15:08:07] <Axy> thanks!!
[15:08:15] <bengalo> thats what you get for working in notepad
[15:08:25] <Axy> notepad++ :P
[15:08:32] <Axy> bengalo, what would you suggest, sublime?
[15:08:56] <bengalo> well, just saying, any decent syntax highlighting should have told you theres something fishy
[15:09:24] <bengalo> think notepad++ should also be doing that
[15:09:35] <Axy> bengalo, I am very new to js and jquery - I don't have a specific toolbag yet
[15:09:49] <Axy> so if you have any suggestions or recommendetions for an ide or an editor, I would love to hear
[15:10:10] <Oka> SublimeText 3 + PackageControl
[15:10:25] <Oka> or Brackets + any linting extension
[15:11:20] <bengalo> well, im prob not a good source, have been using netbeans for pretty much everything im working on =)
[15:11:36] <robertmaxrees> i love sublime text personally.
[15:14:18] <Oka> I far prefer Brackets for most things web related. Sublime is great for python though.
[15:15:14] <Grundell> So im looking in to having a "sticky sidebar" and im working with twitter bootstrap 3.0 roots.io for wordprss..
[15:15:48] <Grundell> The thing is that i want it to not be scrollable in mobile vieq
[15:15:53] <bengalo> would anyone know of network/channel i can get help on for google apis?
[15:17:09] <robertmaxrees> i like ST and then familiarity with my dev tools.
[15:17:11] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:23:28] <motsu> hey, i have a div with multiple spans inside of it, all of which have the same class. im trying to get the last span inside the div that has a class name of input, and then put text into it. i cant seem to get it to find the span.
[15:25:13] <cjohnson> I just told you the answer
[15:25:14] <bengalo> $('span.input').last().text('adfasd') ?
[15:26:32] <motsu> cjohnson: it didnt work and you told me not to ask in ##javascript :p
[15:26:59] <cjohnson> okay then paste what you have so far and we can go from there
[15:28:15] <Oka> $('div > span:last-of-type').html(); ?
[15:28:21] <motsu> what bengalo posted worked.
[15:28:28] <cjohnson> what he posted is what I posted :-/
[15:28:34] <cjohnson> glad you got it sorted
[15:28:39] <motsu> although, i also realized i had a small typo, so what you posted could have worked too cjohnson
[15:29:07] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone im in need for a scrollable horizontal list of divs with indicator in a sort of timeline, anyone recommends a certain plugin or start from scratch?
[15:29:38] <jarr0dsz> i have playing cards listed horizontal and would like to be able to scroll between them ( left and right ) then also an indicator below should show () dots on each card so you can point/click to go to that specific card
[15:29:39] <cjohnson> CSS  overflow: scroll-x;
[15:30:03] <cjohnson> ah, that's called a slider or a carousel
[15:30:05] <jarr0dsz> now i have been looking for jquery ui sortable and scrollable but then still indicator isent implemented
[15:30:07] <cjohnson> there are a million plugins
[15:30:21] <cjohnson> just google javascript/jquery slider/carousel and see which one you like most
[15:31:19] <jarr0dsz> i think maybe even if i modify styling i could use bootstrap 3 slider for this with indicators
[15:31:41] <jarr0dsz> only problem i need the divs (cards) to be placed next to each other not 1 slide at a time like bootstrap slider does
[15:33:57] <cjohnson> you'll probably have to find a plugin that behaves that way then
[15:34:01] <cjohnson> unless you can get clver with CSS
[15:34:17] <dan_j> Hi. When using datetimepicker, is it possible to prevent manual entry into the textbox? Currently users can enter anything in the textbox and I want to avoid that if possible.
[15:34:43] <robertmaxrees> just disable the input maybe?
[15:34:44] <cjohnson> dan_j: bind to the textbox's keypress event and preventDefault
[15:34:52] <robertmaxrees> or disable it.
[15:34:53] <cjohnson> or keydown?
[15:34:59] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[15:35:06] <cjohnson> calm your tits
[15:35:14] <robertmaxrees> woah there.
[15:35:17] <robertmaxrees> homeslice.
[15:36:02] <cjohnson> there's nothing wrong with suggesting multiple things. disabling the input has other implications
[15:36:10] <cjohnson> form submission for instance
[15:36:20] <robertmaxrees> sure - no need to insult me over it.
[15:36:24] <cjohnson> insult?
[15:36:28] <cjohnson> I just said chill out
[15:36:33] <robertmaxrees> whatevs broseph
[15:36:39] <cjohnson> k...
[15:37:04] <dan_j> preventing keypress could work, but they could still paste i assume?
[15:37:25] <dan_j> Not that the users would. Just thinking out loud.
[15:39:38] <cjohnson> you could also prevent the paste event
[15:39:52] <cjohnson> not sure about cross browser support on that
[15:40:47] <decx> open your datepicker with a button and send the selected date to a hidden field
[15:41:05] <dan_j> Thats an interesting idea.
[15:41:08] <dan_j> Thanks for that.
[16:02:36] <paul_irish> can i ask for js help

[16:03:50] <paul_irish> but.. the alternatives kinda blow
[16:04:20] <cjohnson> pastebin next time please. you could declare athe variable above the if and assign it inside the if if you want
[16:04:32] <paul_irish> yahhhhh
[16:04:39] <paul_irish> feels lame
[16:04:48] <cjohnson> well that's basically what you're doing here due to hoisting
[16:04:57] <paul_irish> `let` is semantically correct here right?
[16:04:58] <b-ot> paul_irish: memorised “let`”.
[16:05:10] <paul_irish> calm down b-ot
[16:05:46] <paul_irish> apparently chrome implemented `let` in strict mode but not outside of it.
[16:05:49] <paul_irish> humph
[16:06:35] <cjohnson> let would be right, if you wanted to keep that variable from bleeding out of that if check
[16:06:38] <paul_irish> ya
[16:06:50] <paul_irish> this hoisting is bad and i feel bad
[16:07:07] <cjohnson> it's not too bad. functions shouldn't be very long anyway, imo
[16:07:16] <paul_irish> this one is. :)
[16:07:21] <cjohnson> well fix it
[16:07:24] <paul_irish> k
[16:07:30] <cjohnson> abstract, break it down
[16:07:33] <paul_irish> https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/devtools/front_end/timeline/TracingTimelineUIUtils.js&q=_buildTraceEventDetailsSynchronously&sq=package:chromium&type=cs&l=564
[16:07:34] <cjohnson> make smaller functions
[16:07:35] <paul_irish> loong
[16:07:49] <robertBusy> that's some code.
[16:08:01] <cjohnson> sweet baby jesus
[16:08:14] <paul_irish> chrome devtools source is pretty wild
[16:19:29] <giuseppesolinas> hello
[16:20:04] <giuseppesolinas> I'm getting maximun stack call size exceeded when posting an ajax request, does anybody know what's the typical reason?
[16:20:40] <paul_irish> you should place a breakpoint wherever that's coming from and look at your stack
[16:20:48] <paul_irish> you probably have recursion by accident
[16:21:18] <giuseppesolinas> paul_irish : I'm able to send the request if I pass a string but not if I pass an object
[16:21:31] <paul_irish> yup
[16:22:36] <giuseppesolinas> I don't call any other functions inside the ajax request
[16:23:32] <paul_irish> you're going to need to look in the js debugger
[16:23:57] <paul_irish> either that or put console logs absolutely everywhere to figure out where you're spinning into a loop
[16:24:07] <cjohnson> ooooh I vote console logs
[16:24:38] <paul_irish> certainly a slower technique
[16:25:13] <cjohnson> slow and sensual is how I like it
[16:25:18] * cjohnson caresses the console
[16:27:10] <robertBusy> yus
[16:29:19] <paul_irish> robertBusy: you look busy
[16:29:33] <paul_irish> heres my dope ass patch https://codereview.chromium.org/718283002
[16:29:52] <paul_irish> its lame
[16:29:54] <robertBusy> dope asspatch?
[16:30:03] <robertBusy> just delete the file imo
[16:30:05] <paul_irish> but i'm all about the tiny changes that improve things a lot
[16:30:09] <paul_irish> lol
[16:30:14] <paul_irish> that should work out
[16:30:48] <robertBusey> now i'm Busey, like Gary
[16:35:56] <paul_irish> ok i have another bad question
[16:36:06] <paul_irish> i have a 30px tall inline-block span
[16:36:18] <paul_irish> the text within it is currently at the top of the span. i want it to be in the vertical middle of it.
[16:38:26] <BillCriswell> Is that a trick question?
[16:38:44] <cjohnson> you could line-height: 30px
[16:38:52] <cjohnson> depends really
[16:38:58] <snover> sounds like a #css question :)
[16:39:00] <cjohnson> #css though :P
[16:39:05] <paul_irish> snover: :D
[16:39:15] <snover> don’t make me ban you paul
[16:39:25] <paul_irish> u got op? fuuuu
[16:39:45] <paul_irish> shit
[16:40:03] <snover> 💩
[16:40:10] <paul_irish> AFRfiorstv is hilarious to say outloud
[16:41:24] <BillCriswell> I can't say that word. =(
[16:41:42] <cjohnson> I won't tell on you
[16:42:22] <paul_irish> cjohnson: what kinda stuff you work on
[16:42:39] <cjohnson> boring CRUD applications that pay well
[16:43:02] <cjohnson> actually I'm writing a CMS of sorts for a company that pumps out websites for audiologists currently
[16:43:17] <paul_irish> .g audiologist
[16:43:19] <b-ot> paul_irish: Audiology - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia → http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiology
[16:43:29] <cjohnson> medical professionals, we're breaking into new vertical markets
[16:43:32] <Robdgreat> .g tautologist
[16:43:32] <cjohnson> thus the need to scale
[16:43:33] <b-ot> Robdgreat: Tautology (rhetoric) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia → http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(rhetoric)
[16:43:43] <paul_irish> whats the CMS based on
[16:45:23] <cjohnson> well the CMS is from scratch but it's based on cakephp
[16:45:39] <cjohnson> it is actually a pretty useful system for them
[16:45:44] <cjohnson> just not very exciting
[16:47:18] <cjohnson> integrates to our DNS service API though, and email stuff, and there's a nodejs client for previewing the views on the developer computers without needing to install the whole application
[16:47:29] <cjohnson> the views are mustache templates
[16:48:10] <paul_irish> snover: wdyt ? http://gyazo.com/66ce5eefc7add8344ce75a79382ffb38
[16:48:38] <paul_irish> the labels on the toolbar
[16:48:46] <snover> i think you’re doing a lot of layout
[16:48:46] <snover> ok
[16:48:47] <snover> oh
[16:49:01] <paul_irish> :p
[16:49:35] <snover> what is the difference between “record” and “capture”?
[16:49:47] <paul_irish> nothing
[16:49:53] <paul_irish> it just sucked with one word
[16:49:55] <paul_irish> :x
[16:50:06] <paul_irish> Capture details:
[16:50:21] <paul_irish> that's nice
[16:50:38] <snover> “Yo, what you want?:”
[16:50:41] <paul_irish> basically
[16:50:43] <P0rk> record sounds like it doesn't necessarily return the item. Whereas capture does
[16:50:58] <paul_irish>  http://gyazo.com/ba80d0728a124882efc6271a8a84d54b
[16:51:02] <P0rk> so you could record remotely without the overhead of capturing.
[16:51:17] <snover> i dunnooooo, i think i like my suggestion more ;)
[16:51:23] <paul_irish> P0rk: absolutely
[16:51:32] <snover> chrome dev tools, colloquial edition
[16:52:02] <paul_irish> "Inspect element" ==> "Inspect the hawtness"
[16:52:42] <snover> “Event Listener Breakpoints” “Hey hold up a sec when I touch you this way”
[16:53:41] <paul_irish> yeah i like where this is going
[16:53:56] <BillCriswell> 50 Shades of jQuery
[16:54:50] <snover> “Call stack” “Ring ring, mad stacks here”
[16:57:46] <paul_irish> robertmaxrees more like robertmaxcallstax
[16:57:59] <robertmaxrees> bam
[16:58:07] <robertmaxrees> i just got irish'd
[16:59:09] <paul_irish> also while we're talking about devtools
[16:59:16] <paul_irish> in canary we now highlight DOM changes
[16:59:25] <paul_irish> you can turn it off in settings if you hate it
[16:59:29] <paul_irish> but i think its pretty nice
[16:59:39] <P0rk> i wondered what that was...
[16:59:48] <robertmaxrees> i know a guy who's a dev AND a tool.
[16:59:50] <paul_irish> :D
[16:59:50] <robertmaxrees> that count?
[16:59:56] <paul_irish> no robertmaxrees
[17:00:18] <paul_irish> man its really nice
[17:00:22] <paul_irish> im lovin it
[17:01:53] <cjohnson> paul_irish: what do you mean by highlight dom changes?
[17:02:18] <P0rk> if you have an opacity rollover, it shows opacity in red on yellow
[17:02:33] <P0rk> while it's changing
[17:03:32] <cjohnson> in the current version? I think I'm up to date
[17:03:52] <P0rk> resize the frame while looking at the source in tools and you'll see things light up
[17:04:18] <cjohnson> the Elements tab right? I'm not seeing anything light up :(
[17:06:53] <paul_irish> need newere canary
[17:06:56] <paul_irish> more new
[17:06:58] <paul_irish> so new
[17:07:25] <paul_irish> https://download-chromium.appspot.com/ will be at most a few hours old
[17:07:28] <paul_irish> if you're hardcore
[17:07:31] <shoky> pretty nifty. can't see attributes/stuff being removed though ;(
[17:09:29] <paul_irish> shoky: the node will highlight
[17:09:34] <paul_irish> like <"div"  will blink
[17:09:57] <paul_irish> but you don't see a poof on the actual attribute that was removed
[17:11:26] <shoky> ah right it does. good enough. though a poof would be cool
[17:11:30] <cjohnson> oh, neat
[17:11:35] <cjohnson> I like it
[17:11:52] <Blaster> How come the $.ajax error() callback function doesn't seem to be fired when there's a 500 Internal Server Error?
[17:12:09] <cjohnson> is the 500 ISE returning the proper header?
[17:12:14] <cjohnson> or just printing text to a standard 200 OK page
[17:12:38] <cjohnson> in other words, does success() callback work?
[17:12:41] <cjohnson> fire*
[17:12:47] <BillCriswell> Hmmm..
[17:13:36] * Velveeta grabs a magnifying glass and leans down close to the floor, then up cjohnson's body, and says "mmmm yes, excellent question"
[17:14:27] * cjohnson covers his groin and gasps
[17:15:03] * Velveeta pulls the magnifying glass away from his face and reveals that it wasn't a magnifying glass at all, he just has one abnormally huge eyeball.
[17:15:26] <cjohnson> oooooh, that sure is one big....ball
[17:16:46] <BillCriswell> paul_irish: Have you played with FirefoxDeveloperEdition?
[17:16:53] <Velveeta> we get to have a front end hackathon at work tomorrow and friday, and they devoted an entire keg to it for us.... with the wrong damn beer
[17:17:08] <Velveeta> now one might argue that no free beer is ever the wrong beer... but one would be wrong..
[17:17:37] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Have any ideas for it?
[17:17:41] <cjohnson> there are many free beers that are the wrong beer
[17:17:46] <Velveeta> yeah, i'll probably drink it anyway
[17:17:59] <Velveeta> ohhhhhh you meant the hackathon
[17:18:05] <cjohnson> what'd they get you?
[17:18:09] <BillCriswell> Yes sir.
[17:18:30] <Velveeta> they got us live oak hefeweizen.. i'm just hot a big fan of hefeweizens... but at least it's not a damn IPA
[17:18:52] <Velveeta> we're gonna resurrect an old mapping application we made for our building last year, which never did make it to production
[17:19:17] <BillCriswell> mapping application? that sounds fun.
[17:19:26] <Velveeta> we have like 80 damn meeting rooms, and they're all named arbitrarily after texas landmarks, like "nueces" and "bexar" and whatnot, so there's no rhyme or reason to where they're located
[17:19:29] <cjohnson> oh hush
[17:19:36] <cjohnson> I thought you were going to say they got you a keg of AB
[17:19:55] <cjohnson> hefeweizen is something you can drink all day
[17:19:59] <Velveeta> so we got svgs of the floor layouts, threw em into a node/backbone app for generating maps on the fly
[17:20:05] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: The Alamo
[17:20:06] <BillCriswell> ?
[17:20:07] <Velveeta> cjohnson: we'll find out :D
[17:20:12] <Velveeta> nah, no alamo
[17:20:18] <Velveeta> it's all counties and rivers and whatnot
[17:20:27] <Velveeta> i guess i shouldn't have said landmarks so much as geography
[17:20:33] <BillCriswell> Oh ok.
[17:21:15] <Velveeta> so we're gonna resurrect it, get it finished, see about playing with some kind of geolocation/google map api stuff for generating a map from the person's current location to their destination
[17:21:27] <Velveeta> because i've been in this building for 3 years now on friday, and i still don't know where over half the rooms are
[17:21:51] <BillCriswell> lol
[17:21:55] <Velveeta> we have another team looking to play with flux and react, for something they haven't even decided on yet
[17:22:11] <cjohnson> I like those approaches more
[17:22:19] <cjohnson> use the time to play with something you wouldn't necessarily get a chance but want to play with
[17:22:19] <Velveeta> and another team that's taking the component library my product team publishes, and playing with some angular directive integration around the jquery ui components themselves
[17:22:38] <Velveeta> right, most of the teams are using them to play with brand new stuff
[17:22:52] <BillCriswell> I'm about to get Vue directives working with jQuery UI stuff.
[17:23:03] <Velveeta> one of our guys suggested we resurrect this map idea, and it sounded like a good idea to me
[17:23:09] <Velveeta> bill: nice
[17:23:24] <Velveeta> i'm working on an overhaul to one of our jquery ui components right now, which is coming along fantabulously
[17:24:10] <Velveeta> it's got some internal custom data objects it uses for its own model, and all of the ui updates are based on responses to signals from that model changing, as opposed to just updating based on public method calls or anything
[17:24:38] <Velveeta> i borrowed some concepts from angular and knockout for that
[17:24:51] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Yeah I'm working to understand that stuff a bit.
[17:25:19] <Velveeta> jquery allows you to bind event emitters to objects and collections of objects, so once i started using that, it was pretty simple
[17:25:30] <BillCriswell> As soon as I thought an mvvm in the mix I get really confused on how to handle jQuery UI stuff.
[17:25:50] <BillCriswell> I'm probably over thinking, but hopefully it clears itself up soon.
[17:26:09] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I hear that.
[17:26:13] <Velveeta> just supply each model object with an api of getter/setter functions similar to knockout's observable objects, which trigger a change event that bubbles its way up the model collection to the top level, where a digest cycle is kicked off, essentially, like what angular would do
[17:26:30] <Velveeta> and then the collection is evaluated, and the UI updated accordingly
[17:27:17] <Velveeta> if the collection is in an unreliable state, it heals itself and the digest cycle reprocesses until the model stabilizes
[17:27:55] <Velveeta> in this case, it's a select-type component, so for example, in a single select, there's always supposed to be exactly 1 option selected.. if the code sets 2, it takes the latest one and unsets the others and re-kicks off the digest cycle
[17:28:11] <Velveeta> if they unset all, it finds the first option in the let and sets it as the value and then kicks off the digest cycle again, etc
[17:29:01] <Velveeta> in the list*
[17:29:55] <BillCriswell> Sounds involved lol
[17:32:33] <Velveeta> yeah, it was a pain in the ass to get it all working properly, but now it behaves as it should, and so long as i route all changes through the models, everything works as expected :)
[17:48:19] <hwamokp66> http://thermetrics.hpcreatives.net/#contact  how do i change the location in that embedded map. The url is in a diff form than what google map gives me
[17:50:05] <robertmaxrees> the URL of the iframe has it.
[17:51:13] <robertmaxrees> yep - fix that and you'll be good to go.
[17:53:05] <hwamokp66> robertmaxrees: the format of the url is really weird though. it's not like the share url or the direct url found in google? I've tried both url's in the same place
[17:53:48] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:53:56] <hwamokp66> https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=ru&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Broadway,+Manhattan,+New+York,+NY,+United+States&amp;aq=0&amp;oq=new+york+broad&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=77.57349,125.595703&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=Broadway,+Manhattan,+New+York,+NY,+United+States&amp;t=m&amp;ll=40.717989,-73.979917&amp;spn=0.012035,0.042915&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=A&amp;output=embed
[17:54:00] <robertmaxrees> i see that.
[17:54:04] <robertmaxrees> not sure waht you're asking.
[17:54:07] <hwamokp66> the formatting on that url is something that I wasn't able to duplicate with a diff location

[18:02:03] <maurer> Hey, is there an easy way to replace the contents of a dom node with a text string? Specifically, I _don't_ want to replace it with an html string
[18:02:34] <maurer> It seems like something might be doable with textnodes
[18:03:15] <robertmaxrees> .text()
[18:03:16] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: usually nicer

[19:55:52] <julian``> hey is it possible to use $.ajax on multiple json documents at a time, i have achieved similar effect by calling four $.ajax objects but i would like to use the $.ajaxComplete event handler to trigger a function when all four $.ajax requests are complete - but it triggers the function four times currently. does anyone know a way around this?
[19:56:30] <jeffreylevesque> could someone assist me with jquery-validate?

[20:09:45] <ducklobster> I can see on my backend server that the POST is happening and I can verify that it is returning data using cURL or Postman, but no console.log appears
[20:09:47] <ducklobster> Any ideas?
[20:12:39] <ducklobster> Nevermind, seems I got it. Server Content-Type was application/javascript instead of application/json

[20:13:43] <jeffreylevesque> anyone interested with helping me get jquery-validate working a project?
[20:16:14] <systemfault> julian``: You need to use the promise interface to do it.
