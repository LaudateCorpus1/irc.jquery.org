[02:38:05] <nytek> Hm. Could somebody help me please? I can't seem to add the value of new buttons in this calculator app to the corresponding variables. 'Var first' should += the number count, but console.log() shows that I'm doing something wrong format wise, as nothing is being set. What I want to happen is I type numbers and they're displayed on screen as well as stored in a variable. Then you press an operator
[02:38:05] <nytek> like plus or minus, and
[02:38:51] <nytek> the writing is displayed again, but this time stored character by input button value into the second variable.
[02:39:00] <nytek> This is my code if anyone would please help me:  http://jsfiddle.net/nytek/7wp349j6/
[02:39:40] <nytek> I can get the numbers to display, again, but not to store to the first or second variable slot. :|
[05:17:40] <pj> Hi everyone.  I'm having a problem mixing the selectmenu widget on the same page as jwplayer.  It seems to be focus related, when the play button is clicked on the player or the focus changes in some way a blue border either appears to disappears around the player.  I've created a simplified static test page which shows the problem.  Note that this is a NSFW site, but I've picked a fairly tame video to show the issue and the test page should
[05:17:40] <pj> be OK to view: http://www.mr-s-leather.com/static/video_test_4.html
[05:18:34] <pj> note that if I remove jquery-ui from the equation, or even just don't initialize the selectmenu widget the problem disappears.
[06:58:33] <hellyeah> any programmer around?

[21:39:40] <fattest> i'm trying to add dynamic content to my div, so my scrollbar updates automatically
[21:40:59] <wa5ted> fattest: suggestions: switch the track color and the scroll button color

[21:44:56] <fattest> wa5ted: here https://plnkr.co/edit/qPENZarn0xtRqcuVfVYv?p=preview
[21:45:22] <wa5ted> fattest: what you do
[21:45:33] <fattest> wa5ted i appended everything to section instead of #scroll
[21:46:00] <wa5ted> fattest: well there you go
[21:46:04] <wa5ted> also
[21:46:14] <wa5ted> fattest: you dont need to manually update

[21:49:16] <fattest> wa5ted ok new problem; when icreate the div dynamically, it doesn't work anymore....https://plnkr.co/edit/qPENZarn0xtRqcuVfVYv?p=preview
[21:49:20] <fattest> do you know why?
[21:49:28] <fattest> open script1.js
[21:49:51] <wa5ted> fattest: propogation
[21:50:07] <wa5ted> there is some notation for click evnets that looks like ths

[21:50:38] <fattest> ok
[21:50:42] <wa5ted> $("#scroll").on("section", "click", function....
[21:50:56] <fattest> ye
[21:50:58] <wa5ted> basically this allows you to target children of #scroll that are dynamically created
[21:51:25] <fattest> wa5ted i have  $(document).on('click', '#add', function(e) {
[21:52:19] <wa5ted> well
